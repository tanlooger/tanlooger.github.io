公主的月亮


从前，海边有一座王国，那里住着一位名叫乐诺的小公主。她已过了十岁，快要十一岁了。有一天，乐诺公主吃了太多的覆盆子馅饼，就生病躺到了床上。

御医过来给她看病，为她量了量体温，把了把脉，又让她伸出了舌头。御医担心，就派人去请国王，也就是乐诺公主的父亲。国王便过来看她。

“你心里想要什么东西，我都会给你的，”国王说，“你心里有什么想要的东西吗？”

“有啊，”公主说，“我想要月亮。我要是能拥有月亮，就会好起来的。”

国王的身边有好多好多聪明人，无论他想要任何东西，他们总会为他找到。所以，国王告诉女儿，她可以拥有月亮。随后，他走到觐见室，拉了拉铃绳。三声长一声短。不一会儿，大内总管就走进了觐见室。

大内总管人高马大，是个胖子，戴着一副厚厚的眼镜，看起来他的眼睛有实际的两倍大，也使他看上去有实际的两倍聪明。

“我要你把月亮摘下来，”国王说，“乐诺公主想要月亮。她要是拥有月亮，就会恢复健康的。”

“月亮？”大内总管双眼圆睁，惊叫道。这样一来，他看上去便有实际的四倍聪明。

“是的，月亮，”国王说，“月——亮，月亮。今天晚上就要摘到，最晚到明天。”

大内总管用手帕擦了擦额头，然后响亮地擤了擤鼻子，说道：“陛下，我在任期内为您找到了好多好多的东西。正好我随身带有一张清单，这些都是我在任期内为您找到过的东西。”他从口袋里掏出了一卷长长的羊皮纸。

“现在，让我瞧瞧。”他皱着眉，浏览起了清单，“我找到了象牙、类人猿和孔雀，找到了红宝石、蛋白石和绿宝石，找到了黑兰花、粉红色大象和蓝色贵宾犬，找到了金甲虫、圣甲虫和琥珀里的苍蝇，找到了蜂鸟、舌头、天使、羽毛和独角兽角，找到了巨人、侏儒和美人鱼，找到了乳香、龙涎香和没药，找到了行吟诗人、流浪歌手和舞女，还找到了一磅黄油、两打鸡蛋和一袋食糖——对不起，这是我的妻子写在这里的。”

“我不记得有什么蓝色贵宾犬啊。”国王说。

“清单上说有蓝色贵宾犬，并用一个小小的对勾做了标记。”大内总管说，“所以，肯定有蓝色贵宾犬，您只是忘记了。”

“不要管什么蓝色贵宾犬了，”国王说，“我现在要的是月亮。”

“陛下，我曾经派人到遥远的撒马尔罕、阿拉伯半岛和桑给巴尔岛为您买过东西，”大内总管说，“可是，想要月亮是不可能的。它距离我们三万五千英里，比公主躺的那个房间还大。此外，它是铜液铸成的。我摘不到月亮。能弄到蓝色贵宾犬，就是摘不到月亮。”

国王大发雷霆，吩咐大内总管离开觐见室，派人召来了御用法师。

御用法师是个个子瘦小的长脸男人。只见他头戴又高又尖、布满银星的红帽子，身穿布满金色猫头鹰图案的蓝色长袍。当国王说他想把月亮送给小女儿，希望御用法师摘到的时候，法师一下子变得脸色煞白。

“陛下，我在任期内为您施展了大量魔法，”御用法师说，“事实上，我的口袋里正好有一份我曾经为您施展的魔法清单。”他从长袍的深口袋里掏出一张纸。“开头写道：‘亲爱的御用法师：我随信归还你索要的那块所谓的魔法石——’不，不是这个。”御用法师从长袍的另一只口袋里掏出了一卷长长的羊皮纸。“在这儿，”他说，“现在让我们看看。我曾经为您从芜菁里挤血，又从血里挤芜菁。我曾经从大礼帽里变出过兔子，又从兔子变出过大礼帽。我曾经用魔法从乌有处召来过鲜花、铃鼓和鸽子，又把鲜花、铃鼓和鸽子化为了乌有。我曾经给您找来占卜杖、魔杖和预见未来的水晶球。我曾经把媚药、药膏和药水混合在一起，用来治疗伤心、过饱和耳鸣。我曾经为您亲自专门配制过附子草、茄属植物和鹰泪合剂，用来避开女巫、恶魔和夜间撞见的邪物。我曾经给了您七里格靴(1)、金手指和隐身斗篷——”

“这都不顶用，”国王说，“隐身斗篷不顶用。”

“顶用。”御用法师说。

“不顶用，”国王说，“我跟以前一样不断地撞见东西。”

“斗篷应该是让您隐身的，”御用法师说，“不应该是让您避免撞见东西的。”

“我知道的一切就是，我不断地撞见东西。”国王说。

御用法师又看了看清单，说道：“我为您弄来了精灵国的号角、睡魔的沙子和彩虹上的金色。我还弄来了一轴线、一纸板针和一块蜂蜡——噢，对不起，这些是我的妻子写下来，让我给她买东西的购物清单。”

“我现在想要你做的，”国王说，“就是给我摘来月亮。乐诺公主想要月亮，她得到月亮，就又会好起来的。”

“谁也摘不来月亮，”御用法师说，“它距离我们有十五万英里，而且是用绿奶酪做的，有这座宫殿的两倍大呢。”

国王又一次怒气冲冲，把御用法师打发回了他的小屋。随后，国王敲响了锣，召来了皇室数学家。

皇室数学家秃顶，近视，头戴无檐便帽，每只耳朵后面都夹有一支铅笔。他身穿黑色外套，上面写着白色数字。

“我不想听一九〇七年以来你为我算出过的所有问题的长长的清单，”国王对他说，“我要你马上算出如何为乐诺公主摘到月亮。她得到月亮，便会好起来的。”

“您提到了一九〇七年以来我为您算出过的所有问题，我很高兴。”皇室数学家说，“正好我随身带着一份清单。”

他从口袋里掏出了一卷长长的羊皮纸，瞧了瞧。“现在，让我看看。我曾经为您算出过两难处境之间、日夜之间、AZ之间的距离。我曾经算出过‘上方’有多远，‘离去’需要多久，‘仙逝’会是什么样子。我曾经发现了海蛇的长度、无价的价格，以及河马的平方。我知道，您心里七上八下的时候在哪里，您必须得有多少量的积累才能产生质的变化，您用大海里的盐能捉到多少只鸟——要是您有兴趣知道的话，那就是一亿八千七百七十九万六千一百三十二只。”

“没有那么多鸟。”国王说。

“我没有说过有那么多，”皇室数学家说，“我说的是假如有的话。”

“我不想听什么七亿只假想鸟的事儿，”国王说，“我想让你为乐诺公主摘到月亮。”

“月亮距离我们有三十万英里，”皇室数学家说，“它像硬币一样又圆又扁，但它是由石棉做的，有半个王国那样大。此外，它是粘贴在天上的。谁也摘不到月亮。”

国王又一次雷霆震怒，打发走了皇室数学家，随后拉铃召来了宫廷小丑。

小丑身穿杂色衣服，头戴帽子，挂着铃铛，蹦蹦跳跳进了觐见室，坐在了王座脚下。

“我能为您做什么，陛下？”小丑问道。

“谁也不能为我做什么。”国王悲伤地说，“乐诺公主想要月亮，她得到月亮就能好转，但没有人能为她摘到。每次我无论跟谁要月亮，它就会变得越来越大、越来越远。你什么也做不了，就弹弹你的里拉琴吧。来一曲忧伤的。”

“他们说月亮有多大？”宫廷小丑问道，“有多远？”

“大内总管说它距离我们有三万五千英里，比乐诺公主的房间还大。”国王说，“御用法师说它距离我们有十五万英里，有这座宫殿的两倍大。皇室数学家说它距离我们有三十万英里，是王国的一半大。”

宫廷小丑漫不经心地弹了一小会儿琴，说道：“他们都是聪明人，所以他们一定都是对的。要是他们都对的话，那每个人认为月亮有多大、有多远，它就有多大、有多远。要做的事儿就是查明乐诺公主认为它有多大、有多远。”

“我从来没有想过这一点。”国王说。

“陛下，我要去问问她。”宫廷小丑说。他蹑手蹑脚轻轻地走进了小公主的房间。

乐诺公主醒着，很高兴见到宫廷小丑，但她的脸色惨白惨白，声音有气无力。

“你把月亮给我带来了吗？”她问。

“还没有，”宫廷小丑说，“但我马上就会给您摘到。您觉得它有多大？”

“它只比我的拇指指甲小一点，”她说，“因为我对着月亮举起拇指指甲的时候，刚好盖住它。”

“那它距离我们有多远呢？”宫廷小丑问。

“它还没有我窗外的大树高呢，”公主说，“因为有时候它会被顶部的树枝绊住。”

“那为您摘来月亮会易如反掌，”宫廷小丑说，“今天晚上它被顶部的树枝绊住的时候，我会爬到树上，把它摘下来送给您。”

随后，他又想到了什么。“公主，月亮是什么做的呢？”他问。“噢，”她说，“当然是金子做的，傻瓜。”

宫廷小丑离开乐诺公主的房间，去见御用金匠。他让御用金匠打一只小小的圆形金月亮，就比乐诺公主的拇指指甲小一点，然后又让金匠给金月亮穿上了一条金链，这样公主就能戴在脖子上。

“我做的这个东西是什么？”做完后，御用金匠问道。

“你做的是月亮，”宫廷小丑说，“那是月亮。”

“可是，月亮，”御用金匠说，“距离我们有五十万英里，是由青铜做的，像玻璃球一样圆溜溜的。”

“那是你的看法。”说完，宫廷小丑带着月亮离开了。

宫廷小丑把月亮送给了乐诺公主，她欢天喜地。第二天，她便好了起来，可以起床，可以走出门，也可以在花园里玩耍了。

但是，国王的烦恼还是没有结束。他知道，那天夜里月亮又会闪耀在天空中，而他不想让乐诺公主看到。她要是看到，就会知道，她用金链戴在脖子上的月亮不是真正的月亮。

于是，国王派人叫来了大内总管，说道：“今天晚上，月亮当空照耀的时候，我们一定不能让乐诺公主看到。想想办法吧。”

大内总管若有所思地用手指轻轻敲了敲额头，说道：“我正好知道这件事。我们可以为乐诺公主制作一种黑色眼镜。我们可以让眼镜黑得使她透过眼镜根本看不到什么东西。那样，月亮当空照耀的时候，她就看不到月亮了。”

这令国王暴怒，他左右摇了摇头，说道：“她要是戴上黑色眼镜，就会撞上什么东西。那她又会病倒的。”于是，他打发走了大内总管，召来了御用法师。

“我们必须把月亮藏起来，”国王说，“以免今天晚上月亮当空照耀的时候乐诺公主看到月亮。我们该怎么做呢？”

御用法师首先双手倒立，然后用头倒立，接着又双脚站起。

“我知道我们可以怎么做了，”他说，“我们可以支起柱子，撑开黑色天鹅绒幕。黑色天鹅绒幕就会像圆形马戏帐篷一样遮住整个御花园。乐诺公主透过黑色天鹅绒幕什么也看不到，这样她就看不到天空中的月亮了。”

国王怒气冲冲，来回舞动着胳膊，说道：“黑天鹅绒幕会遮挡空气，乐诺公主不能呼吸，她便又会生病的。”于是，他打发走了御用法师，召来了皇室数学家。

“我们必须有所作为，”国王说，“以免今天晚上月亮当空照耀的时候乐诺公主看到月亮。你要是知道得多，就想出一个办法来。”

皇室数学家四处走动，先是绕圆，然后又绕正方形，最后站住不动，说道：“我有办法了！我们可以每个夜晚在花园里放烟火。我们可以做好多银喷泉和金瀑布；它们燃放的时候，好多好多火花就会布满天空，像白昼一样明亮，乐诺公主就看不到月亮了。”

国王怒不可遏，开始来回蹦跳，说道：“烟花会让乐诺公主睡不着觉，她会得不到任何睡眠，又会病倒的。”于是，他打发走了皇室数学家。

当他再次抬起头的时候，只见外面一片黑暗，月亮的光圈正慢慢地露出地平线。他大惊失色，一跃而起，拉铃叫宫廷小丑。宫廷小丑一蹦一跳走进觐见室，在王座脚下坐下来。

“我能为您做什么，陛下？”他问。

“谁也不能为我做什么，”国王悲伤地说，“月亮又要升起来了。当月亮照进乐诺公主的房间时，她就会知道它还在天上，她没有把它串上金链戴在脖子上。用你的里拉琴给我弹些什么吧，弹一曲十分悲伤的，因为公主看到月亮的时候便又会病倒。”

宫廷小丑漫不经心地弹着琴。“您的那些聪明人怎么说？”他问。

“他们想不出既能藏起月亮，又不让乐诺公主生病的办法。”国王说。

宫廷小丑轻轻地弹起了另一首曲子。“您的聪明人无所不知，”他说，“要是他们藏不住月亮，那就藏不住。”

国王又两手抱住头，叹了口气。

突然，他从王座上跳起来，指着窗户，喊道：“看！月亮已经照进乐诺公主的房间了。是谁解释月亮怎么既在空中照耀，又挂在她戴在脖子上的金链上？”

宫廷小丑停止了弹琴。“当您的那些聪明人说月亮太大、距离太远的时候，谁能解释怎么得到月亮的呢？是乐诺公主。因此，乐诺公主比您的那些聪明人还要聪明，比他们更了解月亮。所以，我要去问问她。”国王没来得及阻止，宫廷小丑就悄悄地溜出了觐见室，走上了通向乐诺公主房间的宽宽的大理石楼梯。

公主躺在床上，但她完全醒着，正在望着窗外当空照耀的月亮。照耀在她手里的是宫廷小丑给她摘来的月亮。宫廷小丑一副非常难过的样子，眼里好像有泪珠。

“乐诺公主，告诉我，”他悲伤地说，“月亮怎么能既在空中照耀，又挂在您戴在脖子上的金链上呢？”

乐诺公主望着他，笑出了声，说道：“傻瓜，这还不容易。当我掉一颗牙齿的时候，新牙齿就会从原地长出来，不是吗？”

“当然是，”宫廷小丑说，“而当独角兽在森林里折断角的时候，一只新角就会从额头中央长出来。”

“说得对，”公主说，“当皇家园丁剪去花园里那些鲜花的时候，其他鲜花就会取代它们的位置。”

“我早该想到这一点，”宫廷小丑说，“因为这跟白昼是一样的。”

“而这跟月亮也一样。”乐诺公主说，“我想所有的一切都一样。”她的声音变得很低，渐渐地消失了。宫廷小丑看到她睡着了。他轻轻地给睡着的公主掖好了被子。

但在离开房间之前，他走到窗边，向月亮眨了眨眼，因为在宫廷小丑看来，月亮好像也对他眨了眨眼。

了不起的玩具师


1


从前有一个遥远的国家，那里住着一个名叫亨德尔的巨人。他身材高大，腰围滚圆，体态笨重，他一走起路来，远处的湖面上都会荡起小小的波浪。他的巨大手指能拧下尖塔上的钟表，就像小孩子剥花生一样容易。每天早晨，他吞食三只绵羊，吞食一块用一千个苹果做的馅饼，还要吞食一块像纺车轮一样又高又宽的巧克力。需要六个男人才能把他的大黄铜钥匙抬到前门。他在屋里点的蜡烛任何一支都需要四个男人才搬得动。

亨德尔总是夺去一座镇子里的绵羊、苹果和巧克力，夺去镇子里的皮革和布匹，夺去木材、牛脂和黄铜，然后到另一个遥远的村子，又开始掠夺。

被他洗劫的任何一座镇子都一贫如洗，没有任何人能强大到足以阻止他的恶行。他用大拇指和食指捏碎了他们最强大的武器，像飓风一样哈哈大笑。

任何镇子里也没有一个人能聪明到足以使他停止破坏。他用巨大的脚趾踩碎了最巧妙的圈套，像火山喷发一样嗷嗷狂笑。

有一天，亨德尔大步流星走过成百上千里格，来到了绿色山谷中的一座小镇。这是一座坚固的小镇，也是一个牢固的小山谷，但小镇和山谷因他到来的声音而颤抖。房子窄小，两层高；街道狭窄，铺着鹅卵石。镇子里人不多，有一百个男人、一百个女人和一百个孩子。

每星期二晚上七点钟，十人理事会都要碰头处理一些简单的公共事务。新月街是一条又短又窄、东西走向的石子路街，理事会成员们就是那里最重要的商人和工匠。这些人是裁缝、屠夫、糖果师、铁匠、面包师、蜡烛师、街灯灯夫、补鞋匠、木匠和锁匠。等处理完这个宁静小镇上的小事之后，理事会成员们就闲坐在那里，猜猜天空有多少颗星星，聊聊玻璃奇妙的透明，赞赞紫罗兰的蓝和积雪的白。接下来，他们就开开玩具师魁罗的玩笑（他们认为他的工作相当浪费时间），然后就回家了。

玩具师魁罗不属于理事会，但他列席所有的会议。理事会成员们之所以非常喜欢魁罗，是因为他做了那些了不起的玩具，也是因为他是一个滑稽可笑、温文尔雅的家伙。魁罗在那张又长又乱的工作台上做出了各种各样熟悉的玩具：音乐盒、提线娃娃、积木；不过，他之所以出名，是因为他自己发明了许多小小的杰作：一个玩耍三颗弹子的小丑、一个真正伐木的樵夫、一个能在一只极小的号角上吹出一首歌曲的七个音符的小号手、一块其中包含的玫瑰会在雪花飘落时突然开放的镇纸。

看上去魁罗像他所有的玩具一样有趣。他是镇子里最矮小的人，身高只有五英尺。他的耳朵很大，鼻子很长，嘴巴很小，他还有一头浓密的白发，像蒲公英球那样直立。他的夹克翻领很宽，长长的尖领上打着红领带，马裤宽松下垂，没有熨过。每年圣诞节，魁罗都会给镇子上的女孩们做小小的金心，为男孩们做的是橡木心(1)。他认为自己是镇子上响当当的人物，因为是他设计了镇子里喷泉的喷水海豚、镇子上旋转木马的木制动物和镇子上钟表表盘十二个穿着鲜红制服的小人儿，每当整点报时的时候，它们就会从表盘下面钻出来，用小小的银槌在小小银钟上奏出美妙的乐曲。

当玩具师魁罗出现的时候，他的朋友们就会习惯性地大声欢呼：“啊，了不起的魁罗来了！”灯夫、裁缝或锁匠有时会蹑手蹑脚地走到他的身后，装作去拧他背上的发条钥匙，好像他是一个他自己设计的机械玩具似的。魁罗欣然接受了这一切；而且，当他背后想象的钥匙转动的时候，他就会僵着腿到处走动，胳膊急速抽动，跟大家一起开心，令笑声越来越多。

巨人到来的那天，情况就不一样了。亨德尔的庞大身躯像旋风一样出现在天空，大地在他的脚下颤抖，镇上的笑声停息了，人们纷纷躲进了自己的家里，心惊胆战地低声交谈。

走了一千里格之后，亨德尔有点儿气喘吁吁，就从山坡上拔起四棵树，给他庞大的身躯腾出地方，然后坐下来。亨德尔俯瞰镇子，咕哝了一声。街上不见一个人，连一只悄悄爬过石子路的猫都没有。

“嗬，镇子！”亨德尔大声叫道。门抖窗摇。“嗬，镇子！把书记员给我叫来，听听亨德尔想要什么！”

镇书记员找来了鹅毛笔、墨水和羊皮纸。“镇子里还有九十九个男人，”他嘟囔说，“但总是镇书记员这个镇书记员那个，什么都得靠着镇书记员！”他走出家门的时候还在嘟嘟囔囔，然后步履维艰地穿过山谷，去听亨德尔想要什么。

一个小时后，镇书记员坐在议会室长桌首席，开始点名。“我们都到了，”铁匠脱口说道，“这你能看到。”

镇书记员继续点名。

“面包师。”他点道。

“到。”面包师说。

“铁匠。”他低沉地点道。

“到。”铁匠乖僻地应道。

镇书记员点完名，从眼镜上面察看了一下，说道：“像往常一样，我们今天晚上有一个客人——玩具师魁罗。我会按照程序进行适当记录。”

“不用担心记录了，”铁匠说，“给我们念一下巨人亨德尔有什么要求。”

镇书记员在会议记录里写下魁罗的名字，说道：“现在，我要念一下上次会议的记录。”

糖果师站起来，说道：“我们省掉上次会议的记录吧。”

镇书记员从眼镜上面察看了一下，说道：“必须适当提案，适时附议。”省掉上次会议的记录得到了适当提案和适时附议。“现在念一下巨人亨德尔的要求！”铁匠大声喊道。

镇书记员用小木槌在桌子上轻轻地敲击着，说道：“接下来是没有完成的议项。我们面临一项决议，就是要调整旋转木马的转速。”

“跳过这一点！”铁匠大声叫道。

“必须适当提案和适时附议。”镇书记员说。跳过讨论调整旋转木马的转速得到了适当提案和适时附议。镇书记员最后展开了长长的羊皮卷纸，说道：“我们现在来商讨今天的事务。我这里有巨人亨德尔的需求情况。这份文件极不正规，‘致敬’‘鉴于’或‘本件已悉’一个也没有包括。”

镇书记员开始念清单的时候，大家都端坐不动。“我亨德尔每天早晨必须有三只羊。”他念道。

“那三个星期内就会用完山谷里所有的羊，”屠夫说，“我们自己的人就不会有什么羊肉了。”

“我亨德尔每天必须有一块像纺车轮一样又高又宽的巧克力。”镇书记员念道。

“啊，那三天后就会耗尽我的储藏室里所有的巧克力！”糖果师嚷道。

镇书记员又根据羊皮纸念道：“我亨德尔三个星期内必须有一件定做的新短上衣。”

“啊，我必须得夜以继日地工作，才能三星期内为这么大的巨人做出短上衣来，”裁缝喘着气说，“这得用完我架子上和地下室里的所有布匹。”

“我亨德尔，”镇书记员继续念道，“三个星期内必须有一双新靴子。”

听到这个，鞋匠唉声叹气，说道：“啊，我必须得夜以继日地工作，才能在三个星期内为这么大的巨人做一双靴子。这会用完我的作坊和内室所有的皮革。”

镇书记员每念出一项要求，理事会的成员们就伤心地摇摇头。魁罗交叉手臂，架着二郎腿，闭上眼睛。他在思考，但看上去他像是一个正在睡觉的玩具。

“我亨德尔，”镇书记员声音低沉地说，“每天早晨必须有一个用一千个苹果做的馅饼。”

面包师从椅子上跳起来，嚷道：“啊，三个星期就要用完镇子上所有的苹果、面粉和起酥油，做这样一个馅饼需要我夜以继日地工作，这样我就再也不能为镇子上的人做馅饼、蛋糕、饼干，不能做蓝莓松饼、肉桂面包、樱桃果船、草莓果馅饼和李子布丁了。”

所有的理事会成员都伤心地唉声叹气，因为他们都爱吃面包师列举的那些好东西。魁罗仍然闭着眼睛坐在那里。

“我亨德尔，”镇书记员继续念道，“三个星期之内必须得到一所房子住。”

木匠当众哭了起来，诉说道：“啊，我必须得夜以继日地工作，才能在三个星期内为这么大的巨人建一座房子。我所有的侄子、叔伯和堂兄弟都得来帮忙，还会用完我的店里和乡下所有的木头、钉子、铰链和玻璃。”

锁匠站起来，朝正躺在山坡上打呼噜的巨人的方向晃了晃拳头，说道：“这么大的巨人的房子，我必须得夜以继日地工作，才能给大门上的钥匙孔配一把足够大的铜钥匙。这会用完店里和镇子上所有的铜。”

“还有，我必须得在他的床边做一支巨大的蜡烛，这会用完我的店里和世界上所有的灯芯和油脂！”蜡烛师说。

“这是最后一项，”镇书记员说，“我亨德尔必须每天听一个故事，让我开心。”

魁罗睁开眼睛，举起一只手，说道：“让我来讲故事吧。我会让巨人开心的。”

镇书记员收起羊皮纸。

“有谁知道怎么消灭巨人亨德尔吗？”糖果师问道。

“我会摸黑悄悄地走近他，用我的打火机给他放一把火。”灯夫说。

魁罗望着他。“你的打火机的火就像草原上的小马掌擦起的火星一样伤害不了他。”

“魁罗说得对，”铁匠说，“但我能在夜里秘密建造一个巨大无比的投石器，它会投出巨石，砸碎亨德尔。”

魁罗摇了摇头，说道：“他会接住石头，就像小孩子接球一样。他会把石头扔回镇子上，砸扁我们所有的房子。”

“我可以把针放进他的衣服里。”裁缝说。

“我可以把钉子放进他的靴子里。”鞋匠说。

“我可以把油放进他的巧克力里。”糖果师说。

“我可以把石子放进他的羊肉里。”屠夫说。

“我可以把大头钉放进他的馅饼里。”面包师说。

“我可以把火药放进他的蜡烛里。”蜡烛师说。

“我可以把他的铜钥匙柄做得像剑一样锋利。”锁匠说。

“我可以把他的房顶盖得摇摇晃晃，这样就会砸在他的身上。”木匠说。

“你们建议的这些方案，”魁罗说，“只会惹恼亨德尔，就像牛虻惹恼马、跳蚤惹恼狗一样。”

“说不定了不起的魁罗有自己的打算呢。”铁匠轻蔑地笑道。

“了不起的魁罗有打算？”糖果师微微嘲笑地问道。

小个子玩具师没有回答。理事会成员们站起来，缓慢而伤心地排着队走出了议会室。那天夜里，他们谁也没有去拧魁罗背后那把假想的发条钥匙。

魁罗好长时间后才离开议会室。当他走过新月街的时候，所有理事会成员的店铺都灯火通明、热热闹闹。这时，传出了叮叮当当、擦擦刮刮、砰砰重击和沙沙作响的声音。铁匠正帮助锁匠为亨德尔的房子做巨大的铜钥匙。木匠正在对一块块巨大的木板又锯又刨。面包师正在给巨大的馅饼做馅饼皮，他的妻子和徒弟正在给一千个苹果削皮。屠夫正在给头三只羊剥皮去除内脏。裁缝在裁剪亨德尔的短上衣。鞋匠正在把做亨德尔靴子需要用的一块块巨大的皮革拼在一起。糖果师把他所有的巧克力都堆在最大的桌子上，同时他的妻子和女儿在大水壶里调制柔软的馅料。蜡烛师已经开始做起了放在亨德尔床边的巨大蜡烛。

当魁罗走到自己店门口的时候，镇子上尖塔的座钟开始敲响。月亮穿破了一小片云，玩具师一只手按在门闩上站在那里，望着十二个戴鲜红帽子、穿鲜红夹克和鲜红马裤的小人儿从各自的数字下面钻出来，用银槌在白色圆形表面的银钟上敲出了这个夜晚美妙的乐声。

玩具店里，魁罗点亮工作台上方的绿罩灯，工作台上杂乱堆积着各种各样零零星星刚开始做和做了一半的玩具。魁罗飞快地拿起闪亮的工具，开始用金属丝、布料、皮革和木头做一个八英寸高的小人儿。完成后的小人儿看上去就像是一种你会偶然遇见它躲藏在郁金香后面或跟癞蛤蟆一起玩耍的生物。它有圆圆的眼睛、圆圆的鼻子和宽宽的嘴巴，没有头发，从头到脚呈蓝色。面孔呈蓝色，夹克呈蓝色，马裤呈蓝色，脚也呈蓝色。

当魁罗站在那里端详这件玩具的时候，灯夫没有敲门就把头探进了门里，凝视了一会儿，就走了。魁罗满意地微笑着，开始做另一个蓝色小人儿。到第一只公鸡打鸣的时候，他已经做了十个蓝色小人儿，把它们收在一只带有沉重铁扣的长木箱里。

灯夫熄灭了最后一盏街灯，太阳升起，蟋蟀不再鸣叫，钟表敲响了五点。山上的巨人受到了变幻的光影和声音的打扰，在梦中翻了个身。镇子上的街头公告员绕过墙角，蹑手蹑脚地溜进了新月街。“嘘！”他对灯夫说，“不要惊醒巨人。”

“嘘！”灯夫说，“他的食物可能还没有准备好。”

街头公告员站在石子街上，轻声喊道：“五点钟了，一切都好！”

除了魁罗家的门之外，新月街上所有的门都飞快地打开了。

“馅饼烤好了。”面包师说。

“巧克力做好了。”糖果师说。

“羊处理好了。”屠夫说。

“我通宵都在做那把巨大的铜钥匙，”锁匠说，“铁匠用他的锤子和铁砧来帮忙。”

“那支巨大的蜡烛，我差不多才开了个头。”蜡烛师说。

“我对锯和刨都厌烦了。”木匠说。

“我的手指都已经硬了，”裁缝说，“巨人的短上衣才刚刚开了个头。”

“我的眼睛很累，”鞋匠说，“他的靴子我差不多才开了个头。”

太阳完全照在巨人的脸上。醒来后，他响亮地打了个哈欠。理事会成员们跳起来，一百个孩子藏进了一百个壁橱里。

“嗬！”亨德尔吼道。这正是铁匠早已等待的信号。他驾起四匹马拉着的马车，驶进了新月街，又从车上爬下来。

“嗬！”巨人吼道。

“抬起来。”理事会成员们咕哝着，把羊抬上了马车。

“嗬！”巨人吼道。

“抬起来。”理事会成员们咕哝着，把馅饼抬了上去。

“嗬！”巨人吼道。

“抬起来。”理事会成员们咕哝着，放好大巧克力。

亨德尔望着马车被装上东西，舔着嘴唇，咆哮着，就像一整个山洞的斗牛犬在吠叫似的。

理事会成员们纷纷爬上马车，铁匠大喊了一声“驾！”，随后喊了一声“吁！”，他瞪眼环顾四周。“魁罗在哪里？”他问道，“那个傻小个子在哪里？”

“他半夜还在店里，”灯夫说，“做玩具。”

其他九个理事会成员轻蔑地哼了一声。

“他本来可以帮忙做钥匙。”锁匠说。

“做馅饼。”面包师说。

“处理羊。”屠夫说。

“做靴子。”鞋匠说。

听到这话，魁罗从店里蹦出来，就像钟表里的一只报时鸟似的，又是鞠躬，又是微笑。

“好了！”铁匠咆哮着说。

“嗬！”亨德尔吼道。

“早上好。”魁罗说。他爬上马车，铁匠对每匹马依次说话。（它们的名字分别是罗波、波罗、奥罗波和奥波尔。）

“我通宵都拿着锤子和铁砧工作，”当那些马突然向前迈步的时候，铁匠说，“在锁匠那里帮助他做巨大的铜钥匙。”他怒视着魁罗。“灯夫告诉我们说你做了一夜玩具。”

“是在做玩具，”魁罗兴高采烈地说，“还想起了一个可以让巨人亨德尔开心的故事。”

铁匠轻蔑地哼了一声。“你一定是通宵锤出了自己的故事吧。”

“还扭了一下。”锁匠说。

“还要平整。”木匠说。

“还要摊平。”面包师说。

“还要缝起来。”裁缝说。

“还要拼在一起。”鞋匠说。

“还要绕着一个中心线来做。”蜡烛师说。

“还要洗净。”屠夫说。

“既不能太苦了，也不能太甜了。”糖果师说。

当马车在亨德尔的脚边停下来的时候，巨人拍了拍手，魁罗和理事会成员们都被刮到了地上。亨德尔开怀大笑，眨眼间就卸完了马车。

“告诉我，你们叫什么蠢名字，”亨德尔说，“你们是干什么的。”

除了魁罗之外，亨德尔的这些新奴仆都依次鞠躬，告诉巨人他们是谁、是干什么的。

魁罗保持沉默。

“你这个最矮小的人，这个白发人，你是谁？”亨德尔问。

“我是讲故事的魁罗。”玩具师说，但他没有像其他人那样对巨人鞠躬。

“鞠躬！”亨德尔吼道。

“咚！”魁罗喊道。

理事会成员们对玩具师的鲁莽无礼感动惊愕，都向后退缩，瞪大眼睛盯着亨德尔的大手。它们先是握住，然后慢慢地松开。阴沉的怒容从巨人的眉宇间完全清除，他突然大笑了起来。

“你是个相当好笑的家伙，”他说，“说不定你的故事会让我开心。要是不能，我就把你放在我的掌心，把你吹到很远的地方，人们五天后才能找到你。你们剩下的人，现在去工作吧！”

当马车载着胆战心惊的理事会成员们返回镇子的时候，魁罗坐在地上，望着巨人就像普通人吃一只云雀一样吃起羊来。“现在，”亨德尔说，“给我讲故事吧。”

“从前，”魁罗开口说着，跷起二郎腿，用一片草叶逗弄一只蛐蛐，“一个巨人翻过一座座山，越过一条条河，千里迢迢来到我们的镇子。他是个强大威猛的巨人，在地上跺跺脚，就能让田地里的奶牛在空中翻个跟斗，然后四蹄落地。”

“哈，”亨德尔咆哮着说，“我在地上跺跺脚，能倒空一湖水。”

“亨德尔啊，这我毫不怀疑，”魁罗说，“因为雷声是你的玩具，山脉是你的凳子。但是，好多好多年前，跋山涉水来到这里的巨人不如亨德尔。他非常虚弱，因一种怪病而倒下。他不得不跑到海里，沐浴在黄色海水里，因为只有大海中央的黄色水域才能治愈巨人。”

“哈，”亨德尔又拿起一只羊，大声吼道，“那个巨人是一只鹅，那个巨人是一只蚱蜢。亨德尔从来不会有病。”巨人咚咚咚击打自己的胸部和腹部，没有退缩，以显示他是多么强壮。

“另一个巨人，”魁罗说，“生病的地方不是胸口，不是肚子，不是嘴巴，不是耳朵，不是眼睛，不是胳膊，也不是腿。”

“一个巨人还有什么其他部位能生病啊？”亨德尔问道。

视线越过绿色山谷，魁罗出神地望着艳阳下的小镇。“是在脑子里，”魁罗说，“因为脑子是一种奇妙复杂的东西。不如亨德尔强大的人，脑子就容易得神秘的疾病。”

“哼，”巨人一边说，一边开始吃起了第三只羊，“亨德尔的脑子像岩石一样坚硬。”他重重地击打自己的额头，没有退缩。

“至今谁也不知道是什么导致了另一个巨人的脑子里出现了这种可怕的疾病，”魁罗说，“也许是他在日落后杀死了一只海龟，要么是在月黑之时顺时针绕着教堂跑了三圈，要么是睡得太靠近日光兰花地了。”

亨德尔拿起馅饼，开始狼吞虎咽地吃了起来。“这只鹅、这只蚱蜢会头痛吗？”他问，“瞧，讲故事的！”亨德尔将头凶猛地撞向一棵树，树干顿时嘎巴一声断成了两截。巨人露出锯齿状的牙齿，放声大笑了起来。

“另一个巨人，”魁罗说，“没有感到疼痛。他的症状不可思议，令人不安。他先是听到了那个词。一天早晨从五点四十五分开始，持续十五分钟，他都听到了那个词。”

“哼哼！”说着，亨德尔吃完了馅饼，伸手去拿巧克力，“巨人每天十五分钟听到的这个词是什么？”

“这个词是‘我得利’，”魁罗说，“在他听来，所有的词都是一个词。所有的词都是‘我得利’。”

“对亨德尔来说，所有的词都不一样，”巨人说，“你告诉我的这也算是一个故事吗？一个唠唠叨叨的呆头巨人听到了一个词，你说这是一个会让亨德尔开心的故事吗？”

当尖塔上的钟敲响六下，鲜红色的小人儿出来敲击银钟的时候，魁罗站了起来。

“我听得到所有的词。”亨德尔说，“这是一块不错的巧克力，否则我就会把你放进我的掌心，把你吹过房顶。”

“我明天会带给你一个更好的故事，”魁罗说，“同时，要确保从你的左肩看到第一颗星星，不要面向下游喝水，睡觉时你的心要总是朝向东方。”

“为什么亨德尔要听这愚蠢无聊的废话？”巨人问。

“至今谁也不知道，”魁罗说，“是什么导致了另一个巨人脑子里的怪病。”但是，亨德尔只是喃喃低吼回应了一声，因为他已经又躺在了山坡上，闭上了眼睛。看到巨人心朝东方躺下的时候，魁罗露出了微笑。

玩具师花了一天时间又做了二十个蓝色小人儿。当第一只猫头鹰枭叫的时候，他站在店门口吹起了口哨。一百个孩子从镇子上的各个角落、墙缝和壁龛里聚集到了玩具店前的石子街上。“回家去吧，”魁罗说，“你们每个人不管是叫苏和约翰，还是叫诺拉和乔，都告诉你们的爸爸妈妈，在月亮爬上山顶之前一刻钟，到嘉年华乐园的旋转木马来吧。就说魁罗有一个计划能消灭巨人亨德尔。”

那群孩子像一朵盛开的玫瑰那样散开了，石子街上顿时响起了他们奔跑的声音。

就连愁眉不展的铁匠、一脸蔑视的灯夫、喃喃自语的街头公告员和吹毛求疵的镇书记员（他整天都在寻找一份镇子居民曾跟一个巨人签过的古老协定），都在指定的时刻赶来，要听听魁罗会说什么。

“是这个小丑的什么奇想把我们像羊一样带到了这里？”铁匠问道。

魁罗爬上旋转木马，坐在一只天鹅上，然后说了起来。起初像风吹过草地一般传来一阵不安的骚动，但当魁罗解释他的计划的时候，就连叽叽喳喳的妻子们都静了下来。当月亮慢慢地从山坡上露头的时候，魁罗结束了演讲。于是，一百个男人、一百个女人和一百个孩子慢慢地离开了嘉年华乐园。

“根本不管用。”灯夫说。

“值得一试。”糖果师说。

“我有一个更好的计划，”街头公告员说，“让所有的女人和孩子站在街上，悲伤地凝视着巨人，说不定他会走开。”

他的妻子挽住他的胳膊，把他领回了家，说道：“我们会试试魁罗的计划。他这小个子有魔法。”

第二天早晨，正当尖塔上的钟表敲响五点的时候，魁罗坐在旁边，神情疲惫的铁匠赶着一辆装有三只羊、一块新鲜苹果馅饼和另一块巨大巧克力的马车，向巨人坐的山坡驶去。亨德尔转眼间就卸完了马车，把食物放在身边的山坡上，开始啃起了一只羊。“最矮小的人，给我讲一个故事，”他说，“要确保不让我打盹，否则我就把你放在我的掌心，把你吹过那边的云层。”

“从前，”魁罗开口讲道，“有一位国王名叫安德布鲁斯达法雷范；他有三个儿子，分别叫尤法布洛多波鲁比、夸姆德尔洛多兰德雷和特里斯多尔卡莫法雷斯。”

“那些名字真难念，”亨德尔说，“再给我说一遍那些名字，我可能就会记住了。”于是，魁罗慢慢地打“从前”开始讲起，巨人又让他重复了一遍那些名字。

“为什么这个国王和他的儿子们会有这么长这么难念的名字？”亨德尔吃第二只羊时问道。

“啊，”魁罗说，“这是因为国王的母亲名叫爱索尔达萨德洛范达罗。”

“再给我说一遍她的名字，”亨德尔说，“那样我说不定就记住了。”于是，魁罗又慢慢地对他说了一遍那个名字。

其实，狡猾的魁罗没有想出要讲的故事，因此故意浪费了很长时间，尖塔上钟表的指针绕着表盘慢慢地爬行。快到五点四十五分的时候，魁罗接着说了起来。“有一天，国王和他的儿子们骑马穿过魔法森林，”他说，“他们遇见了一个我得利。我得利我得利我得利。我得利我得利我得利。”

巨人的眼睛渐渐眯缝，然后又睁大。

“我得利我得利我得利，”魁罗说，“我得利我得利我得利我得利。”

巨人松手掉下了正在吃的巧克力，大声嚷道：“好好说！你说的只是‘我得利’。”

魁罗一副吃惊的样子。“我得利我得利我得利我得利我得利我得利我得利我得利，”他说，“我得利我得利我得利。”

“难道是我得了那种病？”巨人嚷道。他一把抓起玩具师。“还是你想设法吓唬亨德尔？”他大声吼道。

“我得利我得利我得利。”说着，魁罗不由得浑身哆嗦，指着田地里的一个农夫，指着一个摘黄花九轮草的孩子，指着正在巡街的公告员。“我得利我得利我得利。”魁罗重复道。

巨人放下魁罗，站起来，大步流星地走到农夫站立的地方，一下子把他拎了起来，大声嚷道：“说话！多多说话！”

“我得利。”农夫说。亨德尔把他放到田地里，转向那个孩子。

“你叫什么名字？”亨德尔吼道。

“我得利我得利。”孩子说。

亨德尔跨步走到街头公告员身边，怒吼着问道：“几点钟了？”

“我得利我得利。”街头公告员说。

随后，亨德尔向纷纷跑到街上来的男人、女人和孩子大声质问。他问他们多大年龄了、今天星期几、他们要去哪里、他们感觉怎样。他们说“我得利”“我得利我得利”和“我得利我得利我得利”。

亨德尔大步穿过绿色山谷，回到魁罗身边，只见他坐在那里正在拂去吃了一半的巧克力上面的苍蝇。亨德尔大声嚷道：“就是那种病！我听到那个词了！就是那种病！我怎么做才能治愈那种病呢？”

正当尖塔里的时钟敲响六点，正当鲜红色的小人儿出来敲钟的时候，魁罗责备似的说起了话。“我刚才正在给你讲国王和他的三个儿子怎么骑马穿过魔法森林，”他说，“这时你把我拎了起来，又把我扔在了地上，跑走了，你的巧克力都还没吃完呢。”

巨人坐在地上，喘着粗气，下颌牙露了出来，说道：“我听到了那个词。所有人都说了那个词。”

“什么词？”魁罗问。

“我得利。”巨人说。

“那只是第一个症状，”魁罗安慰说，“而且已经过去了。看镇子上的那些烟囱。它们是红的没错吧？”

亨德尔瞧了瞧，说道：“是的，烟囱是红的。你为什么问烟囱是不是红的呢？”

“只要烟囱是红的，”魁罗说，“你就不用担心。因为当你有了第二个症状，镇子上的烟囱就会变成黑的。”

“我只看到了红色烟囱，”巨人说，“可是，是什么让亨德尔听到了那个词呢？”他一边问，一边用力把吃了一半的巧克力远远地扔过了镇子上的屋顶。

“大概是，”魁罗说，“你踩到了半人马的墓上，要么是吵醒了沉睡中的独角兽，要么是在圣尼林节吹了口哨。”

那天夜里，巨人亨德尔在山坡上休息得很不踏实，睡梦中辗转反侧，受到了噩梦的折磨。他睡觉的时候，镇子上最年轻、最活泼的男人们穿着黑色工作服和便鞋，爬上住房和店铺的屋顶，每人都拿着一把刷子，拎着满满一个桶，把所有的烟囱都漆成了黑色。

玩具师魁罗通宵都在忙碌工作，到黎明前的黑暗时分又做了二十个蓝色小人儿，所以现在他共有五十个小人儿。他把新做的和已经做好的一起放进了带有铁扣的大箱子里。

当最早的几只鸟在树上叽叽喳喳叫的时候，灯夫和街头公告员来到了玩具店。魁罗正为一个生病的小女孩修补一个娃娃。他面带微笑，充满自信地向他的朋友们鞠躬，但他们掌心潮湿，嘴巴上腭干燥。

“说不定他会察觉到你的把戏。”灯夫说。

“说不定他会砸碎我们所有的房子。”街头公告员说。正说着，三个人听到巨人在山坡上动了起来。只听他用硕大的指关节揉了揉眼睛，用沉船一样的声音打着呵欠，然后伸展有力的胳膊。玩具师、灯夫和街头公告员透过窗户张望，屏住了呼吸。

巨人坐起来，盯着地面，手指梳理着头发，然后慢慢地抬起头，望着镇子。他紧紧地闭上眼睛，再次睁开，凝视着，嘴角耷拉，然后嘴张开，蹒跚着站起来，大声吼道：“烟囱！烟囱是黑的！我又得病了！”

魁罗开始惊慌地奔跑过石子街，穿过绿色山谷。巨人亨德尔眼睛转动，膝盖抖动，大声吼道：“讲故事的，最矮小的人！告诉我我必须做什么。烟囱是黑的！”魁罗跑到巨人的脚边，气喘吁吁，满脸通红。“瞧，讲故事的，”巨人说，“老实告诉我那边烟囱的颜色。”

魁罗转过身，向镇子望去。“亨德尔啊，烟囱是红的，”他说，“烟囱是红的。看它们多红啊，都比太阳的红光还要红呢。”

“太阳的光线是红的，”亨德尔说，“但镇子上的烟囱是黑的。”

“你发抖呢，”魁罗说，“而且你的舌头伸了出来。这些的确是第二个症状的迹象。不过，仍然没有真正的危险，因为你没有看到蓝色小人儿。还是你已经看到蓝色小人儿了吗，亨德尔？”他问。

“我看到镇子上的人站在街上盯着我，”亨德尔说，“但他们的脸是白的，穿着五颜六色的衣服。为什么你问我看没看到蓝色小人儿？”

魁罗摆出一副严重关切的神情，说道：“当你看到蓝色小人儿的时候，那是疾病的第三个也是最后一个症状。要是发生那种情况，你就必须冲到海里，泡在黄色海水里，否则你的力气就会变得像小猫的力气一样弱小。”

巨人咕哝了一声。“说不定你斋戒一天一夜，”魁罗说，“危险就会过去。”

“讲故事的，我会按你说的做，”巨人说，“因为你是人类中最聪明的人。今天不要给我送任何食物，不用给我讲故事。”巨人叹了口气，向后坐在山坡上，双手蒙住了眼睛。

当魁罗回到镇子里的时候，人们向他轻声欢呼，孩子们把鲜花投到了他的脚边。但是，铁匠满脸疑云。“巨人还在那里的山坡上，”他说，“我把欢呼和鲜花留到他消失那天吧，要是那一天会来的话。”说完，他昂首阔步回到了铁匠铺，帮助锁匠为亨德尔家的前门打造大黄铜钥匙。

那天中午，镇子上所有的人都有了足够的羊肉、馅饼和巧克力，他们都吃得美滋滋的，非常开心。

巨人亨德尔白天焦躁忧虑，夜晚来临时很快就进入了梦乡。正如魁罗希望的那样，这是一个没有星星和月亮的夜晚。住在挂着“时钟与士兵”招牌的客栈屋顶上的猫头鹰对玩具师温和朦胧的活动感到吃惊。魁罗在鼾声如雷的巨人脚边的绿色山谷里秘密地飞快工作，蝙蝠和萤火虫惊奇地绕在他的身边飞来飞去。他在巨人头边的树林里又挖又栽，松鼠和夜莺像一幅挂毯中的绣像那样注视着。要是巨人在梦中突然翻身或咕哝，蟋蟀和青蛙就会极度焦虑，一声不吭。魁罗做完他的事情，回到自己的店铺，蝙蝠和萤火虫在梦幻般的圆圈里舞动，松鼠和夜莺又开始自由活动，蟋蟀和青蛙开始歌唱。落在“时钟与士兵”屋顶上的猫头鹰打起了盹，睡着了。魁罗躺在工作台上躺下来，闭上了眼睛。

红色小人儿敲响了五点钟，最早的几只鸟开始在树上叽叽喳喳叫，灰蒙蒙的光亮降临。这时，魁罗醒来，打开了门。街头公告员站在店铺门口的石子街上。“公告时间，”魁罗说，“喊一切良好。”

“五点钟了！”街头公告员喊道，“五点钟了，一切良好！”

人们偷偷地溜出了家门。在绿色山谷对面的山坡上，巨人亨德尔动了动，打了个呵欠，伸伸腰，揉了揉眼睛，坐了起来。他看到烟囱还是黑的，但他咧嘴笑了，眨了眨眼，说道：“疾病过去了。我看到人们白白的脸蛋，穿着五颜六色的衣服，但我没有看到蓝色小人儿。”他收缩有力的胳膊的肌肉，用铁拳咚咚捶打自己的额头、胸口和肚子。

“嗬，理事会成员们！”亨德尔吼道，“把我的羊、馅饼和巧克力送来，因为我饿极了。”

人们逃离了街道，躲在自家的门后，闩上门，关上窗，侧耳倾听，浑身颤抖。面包师、屠夫和糖果师藏在床下。他们没有给巨人准备饭菜，担心会因此而丢掉性命。但是，勇敢的小个子玩具师顶着晨风中的蒲公英球一样飘扬的白发跑过石子街，穿过绿色山谷，站在了巨人的脚边。

“瞧，我还是好好的一个人！”巨人咚咚击打着额头，吼叫道，“我已经听到了那个词，看到了黑色烟囱，但我没有看到蓝色小人儿。”

“那就好，”魁罗说，“因为要是谁看到了蓝色小人，就必须泡在海中央的黄色海水里，否则他会逐渐变小，先是变得像小杨柳一样高，然后会变得像黄水仙一样高，接下来变得像紫罗兰一样高，直到最后他变成草丛里小小的声音，迷失在雷鸣般的蟋蟀声中。”

“可是，我仍然会比岩石坚硬，比橡树还高大。”说着，亨德尔拍起了双手。

“要是你比岩石坚硬，比橡树高大，”魁罗说，“那就在地上跺跺脚，让那边田地里的奶牛翻个跟头。”

亨德尔站起来，开心得放声大笑，说道：“瞧，最矮小的人，我会让奶牛在空中翻两次。”他猛地抬起右脚，重重地踏在地上。奶牛在田地里连翻了两个跟头，魁罗弹跳得像巨人的腰带一样高，大树枝都从树上掉了下来。但是，巨人看不上这些熟悉的奇观，盯着太阳下面的新东西，既新鲜又微小又可怕。蓝色小人儿已经出现了。蓝色小人儿高高地弹向了空中。他们突然冒出山谷，突然冒出树林，突然从石头后面冒出来，突然从黄花九轮草后面冒出来，突然出现在亨德尔的面前、身后、身下和四周。

“蓝色小人儿！”亨德尔尖叫道，“蓝色小人儿已经出现了！满世界都是蓝色小人儿！”

“我没有看到蓝色小人儿，”魁罗说，“但你就像干旱天气里的溪流一样，已经开始缩小了，那是第三个症状的迹象。”

“大海！大海！给我指一下大海！”亨德尔怒吼道，他此时站在那里瑟瑟发抖。

“它在东方很远很远的地方，”魁罗说，“朝着正在升起的太阳快跑，泡在大海中央的黄色海水里。”

巨人亨德尔朝着升起的太阳奔去。他在奔跑的时候，镇子微微震颤。油画从墙上掉落，盘子从壁架上滑落，砖从烟囱上坠落。小鸟飞起，兔子奔逃。奶牛在田地里翻着跟头，小溪跳出了河床。

两个星期后，一位来自远方的旅行者停在了“时钟与士兵”客栈的招牌边，给客栈老板讲了一个奇妙的故事，说的是一个巨人像起火的森林一样，上气不接下气，呜咽着，跌跌撞撞地跑下山，纵身跳进海里，扑腾着，颠簸着，含糊不清地说着黄色海水、黑色烟囱和蓝色小人；他挣扎着，越来越远地游向大海，直到最后沉在海浪下面，引起了一阵强大的潮汐，翻滚向海滩，激起的水柱高如天空。随后，再也看不见巨人了，波涛汹涌的海水又平静下来，大海在太阳和月亮下恢复了周而复始的神秘潮汐。

客栈老板把这个故事告诉了铁匠，铁匠告诉了锁匠，锁匠告诉了面包师，面包师告诉了屠夫，屠夫告诉了裁缝，裁缝告诉了鞋匠，鞋匠告诉了糖果师，糖果师告诉了蜡烛师，蜡烛师告诉了街头公告员，街头公告员告诉了灯夫，灯夫又告诉了玩具师。

在灯夫讲这件事情的时候，魁罗正给一个新玩具进行最后的润色。他轻声吹着口哨，眼睛闪闪发亮。

灯夫看到那个玩具正是魁罗本人小小的复制品。

“你做这个干什么？”他问。

“你像这样把它放在你的手掌上，”说着，魁罗把小人儿放在他的手掌上，“然后，你像这样吹口气。”他吹了口气，微型魁罗慢慢地飘过空中，轻轻地飘落在地。“我想，这会让孩子们开心的，”小个子玩具师说，“我是从一个巨人那里得到了这个主意。”

白鹿


魔法森林


在一个烟气下沉而不是上升的四月下午，这个时候近处的东西听上去很远，远处的东西听上去很近，你要是闲逛、闲走、闲溜达，走得够远，十有八九最后就会来到位于月亮石矿和半人马山之间的魔法森林。距离还有很长一段路，你就能凭借一缕永远不能完全忘记又永远不能完全记起的芬芳，知道森林就在那里。而且还会有远处传来的钟声，这钟声会使男孩们奔跑大笑，女孩们驻足颤抖。你要是从奇妙树林边缘的翠绿色草丛中生长的一万朵伞菌中摘下一朵，拿在手里会觉得它像一把锤子那样沉甸甸的，但你要是松开它，它就会像一顶小小的降落伞轻快地飘过树顶，留下一串黑星和紫星。

这里还有一个传说，最早是中世纪时代的吟游歌手说的，据说，这里的兔子能像现在人们脱帽行礼一样歪着头，用爪子把头摘下来，再重新放回去。

这个魔法森林从前是一个名叫克洛德的强大君主的国土的一部分，克洛德有三个儿子——萨格、甘罗和乔恩。萨格和甘罗像他们的父王克洛德一样，都是出色的猎手。他们不吃饭或不睡觉的时候，就忙着追猎。最年轻的王子乔恩个子最小——他身高只有六英尺——是一名诗人和乐师；他不吃饭或不睡觉的时候，喜欢弹里拉琴作曲填诗。当父王和兄长执意坚持的时候，他偶尔也会参加打猎，但射箭和投矛都小心翼翼，完全避开皇家贵族家庭追赶的所有猎物。

他们生活的那个世纪中期，国王和他的两个大儿子曾经三次猎尽了王国的野生鸟兽，不得不三次在城堡四周等待，焦躁不安地拉弓上弦，给箭插羽毛，磨尖长矛，直到新一代的鹿和野猪能在田地里和森林里最后成熟。在单调乏味的休猎期间，克洛德国王、萨格和甘罗吃得更勤，喝得更多，睡得更久，而且他们还殴打、折磨随从，尤其是侏儒孔多和御用巫师。这个城堡里巫师的魔法主要是变戏法和杂耍，因为他并不懂那些住在魔法森林里的林间巫师们的秘诀。

乔恩认为这些季节宁静，用歌声打发时光，歌唱一位远方的公主，唱她有一天会给每位王子布置一项危险的任务去完成。他歌唱，是爱情，而不是强力，才能解开魔结，打开魔锁，蒙蔽恶龙，决心完成远方的公主可能布置的任何其他任务，以赢得她的芳心，牵住她的手。萨格和甘罗对他们的弟弟的“过于讲究的行为”哄笑起来，他们常常喜欢把侏儒孔多像球一样在空中抛来抛去，完全不理会他的喉咙里发出的抗议声。哥哥们明白事理，不至于去欺负乔恩，因为他不止一次在和他们摔跤的时候故意落败，另外，他能够在马背上侧着身子固定住自己。

第三个休猎季的一天夜里，乔恩轻轻地弹起了里拉琴，伤痕累累的孔多坐在宴会厅里的一个黑暗角落，在一面大盾牌下面护理自己的累累伤痕，当时还要等很久很久才有野猪和鹿冒险出来，克洛德国王一边豪饮，一边给儿子们讲故事。

“总有魔法森林能打猎。”吃晚饭的时候，萨格王子一边测试一把长弓的弦，一边咆哮着说。

“总有魔法森林要躲开。”克洛德国王咆哮着说，他接着讲起，他有一次怎样斗胆跟他自己的父亲和两位哥哥一起在魔法森林里追逐一只行动敏捷的鹿，他们怎样把那只鹿逼到半人马山的峭壁上，当他们准备射箭的时候，那只鹿却变成了一位身材高挑、皮肤黝黑的年轻公主。一个邪恶的老巫婆嫉妒年轻姑娘的美貌，几年前把她变成了一只鹿。

克洛德国王接着说道：“你们的祖父博德国王，和他的三个儿子——就是你们的伯父科龙、加尔夫和我本人——我们在那里像绵羊似的，感到懊恼沮丧，或者像一只猛犬怒吠着大胆地闯入了狼窝，遇到的却是一只红眼母兔。不久，一个笑嘻嘻的林间巫师出现了，他用魔法为公主牵来了一匹白马——我还记得是凭空牵来的——我们就骑马向城堡奔跑。”

“我们给公主送了食物和葡萄酒，还给她送了一个枕头。第二天，我们一身盛装，挂着叮当作响的马饰出发，送她去找她的父亲——他的王国在遥远的北方。出发的时候是五月天，我们叮当作响着穿过苹果花丛，等接近她家祖传城堡的时候，叮当作响着穿过了漫天雪花。再次见到女儿，她的父母亲欣喜若狂。为了庆祝这个时刻，她的父王操办了一桌桌还算不错的宴席。尽管按照我的口味，北方的葡萄酒带有一点皮带扣擦亮剂或长矛润滑油的味道，可能是这么回事——这是好多年前的事儿了。”

“为什么你从来没有讲过——”萨格问。

“——以前没有讲过这个故事？”甘罗问。

“你们当时太小了，”克洛德说，“这样一个故事可能不利于心灵成长……我讲到哪里了？”

“这是好多年前的事儿了。”萨格提示道。

“啊，是的，”克洛德说，“嗯，你们的祖父、伯父和我都迫不及待地想启程回家狩猎。公主的父亲是一个有那么点乐子的家伙，具有居家的性情，即使在最明快的狩猎天气，也习惯一边把时间消磨在棋盘上，一边喝着充满芦荟之类的温酒。

“我们没有像原来想的那样尽快轻松离开。这个国家有一种可恨的习俗，就是得救的公主有权要求一个营救者做她的丈夫。公主是一个足够漂亮、灰色眼睛的冒失姑娘，但她喜欢弹竖琴和讲故事，根本不喜欢追猎。她还喜欢不为人知地在一个男人身后飘飘走动，就像一只猫在天鹅绒上走动一样。”

“于是，你的祖父独自骑马回家了，公主给科龙、加尔夫和我本人各自布置了一项危险的任务。科龙要去把费拉雷恩大猎鹰的金色右翅带回来；加尔夫充其量是一个粗俗的无赖，却又是马鞍上的天使，他被派去带回一百位国王右手食指上的一滴血，可以想象，这是一项任何人用一生都完不成的冒险任务；我被派去距离不远处的一个山洞里为公主取回一颗巨大的钻石，据说钻石位于一个半龙半鹏的可怕动物的两爪之间。”

克洛德国王从面前桌子上的一碗酒里斟满了两大杯，一饮而尽。“你们当时还太小，都记不得了，”他继续说道，“大约二十年前，一个从遥远的费拉雷恩赶来的旅行者经过这里的时候，捎来消息说，你们的科龙伯父在跟大猎鹰搏斗中被打败了。在搏斗中，他发现猎鹰的左翅是用有棱有角的钢片做成的，在战斗的过程中蒸发了。你们的加尔夫伯父至今也没有音信，我的皇家史官估计，需要九十七年才能从一百位国王的右手食指上各得到一滴血，他觉得这个时间很合理。”

国王又一次斟满两大杯葡萄酒的时候，乔恩王子在里拉琴上弹起了一首忧伤的歌。

“这个故事有些令人烦恼，就长话短说吧，”国王又说道，“我被派去征服的怪物原来是黏土和黄杨木做的，因此从这个野兽紧抓的假爪之间夺走那颗巨大钻石，是三件任务里最简单的一件。我把那颗宝石送给公主，然后娶了她。就连那里的孔多也能明白我已经赢得了美人的芳心。”

国王坐回他那把大椅子，闭上了眼睛。

“这个故事的寓意到底是什么呢？”孔多嘟囔道。

国王睁开一只眼睛，说道：“这个故事的寓意再清楚不过了，就是绝不要在魔法森林里猎鹿。”

萨格和甘罗坐在那里盯着父亲诉说往事，面面相觑，又瞧了瞧国王。

“我们不喜欢这个故事。”萨格说。

“我们的母亲曾是一只鹿！”甘罗说。

乔恩第一次开口说话。“那只是魔法赋予的虚无缥缈、毫无意义的形状。”说着，他又回到自己的音乐中。

“这个孩子说到了点子上，”克洛德国王大声说道，“正如他所说——那是毫无意义的魔法。”他轻轻地敲了一下桌面上的一个大酒杯。“不过，从来没有完全真正习惯过魔法，”他最后承认说，“不要以为猎人就能习惯。”经过好一阵子若有所思的沉静之后，克洛德才又开口说话。“乔恩出生后不久，她就身患绝症，卧床不起，再也没有踏上楼梯一步。”

“也许她是摔了一跤死的。”萨格说。

“也许她是吃多撑死的。”甘罗说。

“也许她死于一个眼神。”乔恩说。

国王用力地向小王子扔去一个大酒杯，乔恩凌空接住。

“有他母亲的敏捷和他母亲的优雅。”克洛德喃喃说着，叹了口气，“那么，故事就是这样。”

内务大臣的声音突然在克洛德的椅子后面响起，国王微微一惊。“我必须用像猫一样蹑手蹑脚地走路的手下吗？”克洛德吼道。

“陛下，有一个吟游歌手求见。”内务大臣说。

“那就让他进来，那就让他进来！”克洛德嚷道，“他要给我们唱大力士追猎的歌。我已经听够了忧伤和爱的歌。”他怒视着乔恩。

吟游歌手轻轻地走进来，坐在一个凳子上，一边弹着里拉琴，一边唱。他唱起了一只白鹿，这只白鹿跑动的时候像光一样快，看上去像春天里的瀑布一样优美。

他唱完一曲后，国王问道：“这只像光一样快、像春天里的瀑布一样优美的白鹿，是你愚蠢的幻想，还是它有呼吸和血肉，能让我和我的儿子们检验它的速度和力量？”

吟游歌手唱道：

“白鹿如光闪现

日夜穿过林间。”

“给我说出这座森林的名字。”国王吼道。

吟游歌手唱道：

“白鹿日夜闪现

在大山石矿间。”

听到这里，克洛德国王从椅子上站起来，把一杯红葡萄酒碰翻在地。“你这首该死的曲子界定的是魔法森林！”他嚷道，“克洛德国王的家人绝不会在那片该死的林中狩猎！”

吟游歌手唱道：

“对萨格太快，而对甘罗太灵，

年轻王子乔恩跟不上，太猛，

可是，乌龟的爪、蟾蜍的心

却绝不能跟克洛德相提并论。”

国王捋了捋又黑又长的胡子，目光像萤火虫光一样闪闪灭灭灭灭闪闪。“也许，”他终于说道，“这只像光一样快的白鹿是一只真正的鹿。我们明天检验一下它被夸张的力量。它要是一只真正的鹿，我要把鹿头挂在墙上，把鹿肉放进食品柜。那要是一个被某个巫婆或男巫施了魔法的美丽少女，要是领地位于东西南北某个方向的国王的女儿，我就用长矛和箭扎穿这个愚蠢的吟游歌手的心！”

克洛德国王在桌子上咚咚咚地敲击酒杯，以强调他不祥警告说出的每个字，但他环顾四周，只见吟游歌手已经销声匿迹了。克洛德国王皱了皱眉，喃喃说道：“这个家伙跟我在某个地方遇到过的某个人长得像极了。”

“这要是一只真正的鹿，”萨格说，“我们就会享受历史上最精彩的一次追猎。”

“这要是一只真正的鹿，”甘罗说，“我们就会晾挂出全世界最出色的鹿肉。”

国王吞下一颗大杏的时候，眼睛微微闪光。

“那要是一位具有皇室血统的真正公主呢？”这是从屋角传来的侏儒孔多的喃喃说话声。国王用力把一个苹果向侏儒扔过去，但乔恩伸手凌空接住。

“这要是一位具有皇室血统的真正公主，”乔恩说，“她就会给克洛德的每个儿子布置一项危险的任务，以找到最值得她爱的那位王子出嫁。”

听了这话，为了展示自己的力量，萨格从壁炉里抓起一块沉甸甸的铁，一下子对折弯曲，甘罗在地上向前连翻了两个跟头。乔恩一边望着哥哥们，一边拨动里拉琴。国王拽着自己的胡子，眼睛因梦想追猎而熠熠闪光。孔多坐在墙角的盾牌下面，一边望着克洛德、萨格和甘罗，一边倾听乔恩里拉琴的音乐。

第二天早晨，当太阳冉冉升起的时候，国王和他的三个儿子骑着黑色战马，进入魔法森林，勒马慢行，环顾四周。

“不要摘那朵金凤花，”克洛德伸出一根皮革般强韧的手指，指着翠绿色草地里的一朵小花说，“否则它会变成火焰，烧伤你的手。”

“不要揪那棵树上的青苔，”萨格说，“否则它会变成血液，染红你的手。”

“不要碰那里的白石，”甘罗说，“否则它会活过来，咬你的手。”

月亮石矿山后面突然传来了隆隆雷声，太阳消失，一道闪电划过，四匹马顿时浑身颤抖。国王和他的儿子们四周的黑暗中闪动着上百万只萤火虫。

在克洛德和儿子们惊奇地凝视着闪烁飞舞的萤光的时候，萤火虫变成了片片雪花，轻柔地飘落在地，销声匿迹。雷声停止，云层破开，太阳又出来了。

“这些骗人眼睛、司空见惯的花招不利于人的消化，”克洛德国王说，“要是这种虚假情况和外形的变化不停下来，我对世界上最可口的肉都不会有任何胃口。”

“热就是冷。”萨格说。

“硬就是软。”甘罗说。

“夜就是昼。”克洛德说。

在奇迹显示期间，乔恩想出了一段诗句，朗诵道：

“黑就是白，

红就是蓝，

暗就是光，

真就是真。”

“好诗，乔恩王子。”一个声音说，这个声音仿佛是凭空冒出来的，直到国王和他的儿子们低下头，才看到一个头戴红色尖顶帽、身穿蓝色长袍的林间男巫。

“嗬，”国王瞪着男巫说，“除了在这里之外，我没有在别的地方见过你吧？”

“除了现在之外，你在别的地方见过我。”说着，男巫摘下一朵三色堇，抛向空中。那朵三色堇在空中变成了一只蝴蝶，扇动着翅膀穿过树林飞走了。

“我以前只来过这树林一次。”克洛德国王说。

“是二十六年二十五天二十四小时前。”男巫说。

“我和我的父亲、哥哥们当时追猎一只鹿，”克洛德说，“到了半人马山的峭壁的时候，莫名其妙、令人痛心的情形发生了。我对这个话题也有点儿恼火，所以不要翻动舌头嘲弄。”

“他没翻动舌头，”乔恩说，“他会让你自己的舌头打弯，说出‘t’和‘m’开头的词。”(1)

“你会发现还有‘w’开头的词。”男巫说。

国王以高人一等的口气说道：“耗子魔法师，你要是在特洛德身上试两次那个花招，我们就要把这些巫师都赶出树林。”克洛德国王做出一副傲慢、权威而严厉的皇家姿态，儿子们惊讶地盯着他。

“尊贵的克洛德，你说的是魔术字眼。”男巫自鸣得意地说着，摘下帽子，深鞠一躬。“现在，我可以为你、萨格、甘罗和乔恩三位王子效劳吗？我可以带你们去看会叫的树木、音乐泥浆或无翅鸟群吗？”

听到这些奇观，国王面目狰狞，乔恩王子回答了男巫，说道：“我的父亲在寻找一只白鹿。这只白鹿像光一样快，如春天的瀑布一样优美。”

男巫又鞠了一躬，把帽子抛向空中，说道：“上升的东西不能降落。”那顶帽子像铃铛一样慢慢地晃悠着，默默地飞过树林，越升越高，直到最后再也看不见。

“降落的东西必须上升。”男巫说着，向地面摆动了一下左手的三根手指。突然，那些已经融化和消失的雪花开始从地面升起，当飘到跟男巫的心脏位置一样高的时候，它们变成了上百万只萤火虫。国王和他的儿子们惊奇地望着，一时间四匹马和四个人像雕塑一般惊呆了，因为透过明明灭灭或强或弱的光亮，突然闪现出了一只白鹿，只见它像光一样快，如春天的瀑布一样优美。

“嗬，哟啰！”国王喊道，他和儿子们追踪而去，马蹄溅起的火花汇入了萤火虫的舞蹈之中。

白鹿掠过绿色森林，国王和儿子们尾随其后，经过会叫的树木，越过音乐泥浆，进出无翅鸟群。他们一直追啊追，直到太阳开始坠落，一片片奇特的长影落下。白鹿领着追猎的人们涉过一片银色沼泽、一片青铜泥塘和一片金色的林间空地，速度还是像光一样快。它又像箭一般掠过一片熊熊燃烧的沼地，越过一片薄雾缭绕的湿地，爬上一段红宝石山脊，跃过一条紫罗兰山谷，然后沿着一条通向迷津遍地的月亮石矿山的珍珠小路飞奔。

二十只蹄子雷鸣般隆隆穿过一条鬼影幢幢、挂满灯笼的大枫树山谷，经过一个蓝绿相间的山中小湖，顺着一条日光兰丛生的林荫大道，弯弯曲曲拐进了一段昏暗的斜坡，最后通向了一片暗淡苍白、危机四伏的平原。落日沉入大海，北斗七星突然闪耀在天空，白鹿度过了可怕的一天，跑得精疲力竭，现在静立不动，在半人马山巨大的绝壁下面打着寒战。

克洛德国王、萨格王子和甘罗王子准备放箭。面对这种情景，乔恩王子闭上了眼睛。过了一会儿，当他睁开眼睛的时候，只见皇家猎手们弓箭都掉在了地上，盯着的不是一只陷入绝境的鹿，而是一位个子高挑、皮肤黝黑、朝气蓬勃的少女，一位名副其实的公主，只见她身穿白色绸缎长袍，头发上珠光闪闪，脚穿金色凉鞋，红唇微启，乌黑的眼睛炯炯有神。

四匹马猛地一惊，竖起耳朵；三位王子跪倒在少女的脚边；国王拽着胡子，怒目而视。

“任何一个国王都可能会知道一流的追猎就是这样，”他咆哮着说，“结果却总是鹿肉销声匿迹，把一位可爱的小姐送回国去。祈求上帝，让她父亲的饮酒品位还不错吧！”

但是，三位王子中，只有年轻的乔恩还能开口说话。当他请少女说出她的名字、告诉她所属王国的名字的时候，她却只能摇摇头说她不知道。

克洛德国王叹了口气，说道：“乔恩，把她甩上你的马鞍。我们要以另一种方式在我们的餐桌边伺候她，而不是我原来希望的那样。要抢在那个邪恶的林间巫师出现并嘲笑我们所有人之前，赶紧行动。”

乔恩王子把公主扶上马鞍，马铃和马具搭扣叮当作响，这在飞快掉转马头的克洛德国王听来就像欢快的笑声。随后，他们开始踏上了回家的漫长旅程，越过暗淡苍白、危机四伏的平原，登上那段昏暗的斜坡，沿着日光兰丛生的林荫大道，经过蓝绿相间的山中小湖，穿过鬼影幢幢、挂满灯笼的大枫树山谷，在迷津遍地的月亮石矿山进进出出，沿着珍珠小路，跃过紫罗兰山谷，爬上红宝石山脊，涉过薄雾缭绕的湿地，跑过熊熊燃烧的沼地、金色林间空地、青铜泥塘和银色沼泽，进出无翅鸟群，跨过音乐泥浆，路过会叫的树木，穿越绿色森林和微微发光的萤火虫，终于走出了魔法森林，踏上了直接通向城堡的开阔大路。





迷失的公主


第二天上午，公主坐在东边的房间里，望着阳光透过古堡墙壁的狭缝和圆孔照进来，在冰冷的石地上形成了明亮的小小图案。

为了给公主取乐，御用巫师抛接七颗银球。我们说过，这个巫师就会玩几下拙劣的把戏。这时，孔多坐在墙角，先是望着银球，然后望着可爱少女那双困惑的乌黑眼睛。夜里大部分时间，她都醒着躺在那里，设法想起自己和父亲的名字，却怎么也想不起来。

皇家史官盘腿坐在她脚边的地上，从一本沉甸甸的花名册中念经一般念出那些国王的名字，希望其中一个名字能让这位小姐的眼睛为之一亮。他念到了以P开头的名字，有条不紊、连续单调低沉地念着……“帕克、帕尔多、佩奥雷尔、彭特、佩里尔、皮奥、皮利格罗、匹夫、婆多、婆罗内尔、帕奇。”听到“帕奇”这个名字，公主微微一惊——不过，是因为御用巫师掉落了一颗银球。孔多拾起球，又扔给了他。

皇家史官用舌头和牙齿发出了一连串声音，不以为然地说道：“在整整一本国王花名册中，帕奇国王最声名狼藉。他跟七个鲁莽的女儿住在一座破败的山顶城堡里。公主们很小的时候，老国王的妻子死于一阵突发的尖叫。现在帕奇和七个少女单独住在那里，在山上惹是生非，搞各种破坏：滚落巨石砸伤过路人，使正常河流改道，偷走大篷车里的宝石和丝绸衣服，这样他们就可以乔装打扮穿红戴绿，借着空心南瓜灯的光玩狂野怪诞的游戏。”皇家史官抬起双手，摇了摇头，“在帕奇山上，每天夜里都是万圣节。”

公主皱了皱眉，脸色变得有点儿苍白。皇家史官又叹了口气，念出了更多的名字，念一个就瞅一下公主，但她没有做出任何耳熟的表示。他继续念下去，念了二十个Q、三十个R、四十个S、十个T、五个U、两个V、十三个W、九十个X和五十六个Y开头的国王名，最后念到了Z开头的名字。“扎尔。”他说，公主从椅子里跳了起来，只是因为御用巫师又掉落了一颗银球。孔多把球扔给了他，杂耍声和低沉单调的声音又继续起来：“扎罗、札特、扎瓦佐、扎弗、扎克斯、扎伊、扎祖诺、宰兹。”皇家史官念完后，用一只沾满灰尘的手啪地合上皇室名册，伤心地摇了摇头，站起来。

巫师让银球纷纷落进了长袍大口袋。孔多温柔地注视着公主。

“我记得有树木和田野，别的都不记得了。”她叹了口气说。

“这个问题要让医生解决，”皇家史官说，“但遗憾的是，御医相当讨厌一些莫名其妙的怪病，曾下令不要用这种病打扰他。”公主目光困惑地打量着地上一个锯齿状的阴影图案。“当然，还有御用钟表匠。在任的时候，他曾做过好几次敏锐推测。钟表匠托克，”他补充说，“过去曾是皇室天文学家。”公主掏出手帕，擦掉了花名册在皇家史官脸上留下的污迹。

“为什么托克不再是皇室天文学家了呢？”她问。

“他年龄太大了，完全看不清那些星球了，连月亮和太阳都看不清了。”皇家史官说，“他不断报告说一切都要熄灭了，这让克洛德国王惊慌失措。你知道，他必须靠光来打猎——没有冒犯的意思。”

公主微微一笑。

皇家史官接着说了起来。“于是，克洛德国王大声命令道：‘给我的塔楼里派一些人手，让他们送来明亮的太阳和星星的消息！’因此，托克被派去制造钟表、排钟和日晷，现在是一个名叫帕斯的比较年轻的人在观察天象。他为自己的望远镜发明了玫瑰色镜头，即使最苍白的月亮和最冷的星星也变成了深红色，他就这样向国王报告。让我们拜访老托克那间昏暗的作坊吧，听听他会怎么说。”

他们发现托克在作坊里给一个日晷刻印文字：“这短暂的光明之后，就是无穷无尽的黑暗。”老人眼睛昏花，一百座钟表嘀嗒嘀嗒走，当当当报时，声音响亮，他没有注意到客人来访。公主念出了另一个日晷上刻印的文字：“它比你想的更黑暗。”第三个上是：“这微光之后就是黑夜。”皇家史官轻轻地拍了拍老钟表匠的肩膀，托克抬起头，眼睛暗淡模糊。

“我带来的是一位无名无姓的公主，”皇家史官说，“她记得的只有树木和田野，别的都不记得了。”他把一只手握成杯状，贴近老人的耳朵，讲述白鹿的故事，讲它如何在半人马山脚下变成了一位个子高挑、皮肤黝黑的可爱公主，讲他如何念出了皇家名册里所有国王的名字，却没有让公主的眼睛为之一亮。“你曾是一个敏锐推测和天才猜测的人，”皇家史官最后说道，“你说她犯的是什么病？”

钟表匠挥动着一只手的细长的手指，说道：“送这位小姐到花园散步，去银色喷泉的地方，这会儿让我碰运气猜一下她的脑子出了什么问题。”一百座钟表的指针指向了正午，但那些钟表要么敲八点、六点、九点和四点，要么敲所有其他时刻，就是不敲十二点。“少女们会对钟表产生一种奇特的影响，”托克说，“不是让它们敲得太少，就是让它们敲得太长，这会让时间扭曲。”皇家史官把公主领到门口，给她看那些有银色喷泉的花园。他望着她，只见她可爱却又孤独，走在一个个喷泉之间，走到听不见钟声和人声的地方。

“也许是她摔倒，碰在了石头上，”皇家史官说，“这样就失去了记忆。”老人摇了摇头。“也许是她喝了迷药，”皇家史官说，“这样就失去了记忆。”老人又摇了摇头，说道：“你请我推测，你却自己推测了起来。”皇家史官说对不起，然后就静静地听老人说。

“我想起了我的父亲大约一百年前讲过的一个故事，”托克说，“是一个有关一只鹿跟一个林间巫师交友的奇妙故事。古时候，这个林间巫师好像是摔了一跤，也可能是喝了魔水或迷药，不知不觉地掉进了一条小溪，四月的溪流又急又猛。故事讲的是一只鹿经过的时候，如何从溪流中拽起了那个失去知觉的男巫，救了他一命。为了报答这种好心及时的行动，男巫就给了那只鹿变形的能力，当它被猎人们步步紧逼无处可逃——比如被逼到半人马山前——的时候，就能变成一位个子高挑、皮肤黝黑的可爱公主。”

皇家史官的眼睛瞪得又大又圆，嘴巴耷拉，张开。在接下来的停顿间歇，一百座钟表敲响了十三下，指针却指向了十二点十一分。当报时声停下来之后，皇家史官开口说话了：“托克，你是想告诉我，除了外形，这个公主不是皇室血统，完全是一只鹿吗？”

“没过多久，”老人接着说道，“我说的那只古鹿被当地的某个毛头小伙子步步紧追。这个小伙子骑术没得说，把鹿逼到了一道绝壁前面。就在猎人举起弓的时候，他定睛一看，只见这只气喘吁吁、怒目而视的鹿外观上完全变成了一位个子高挑、皮肤黝黑的可爱公主。小伙子脸上红一阵，白一阵，蓝一阵，把弓箭撇在地上，驱赶着那匹筋疲力尽的马用最快的速度跑走了。”

“乔装成少女的鹿前往打过交道的林间巫师的洞穴，声音颤抖地问了他一个问题：它怎样才能继续做少女，像少女那样生活呢？巫师出于他原来的感激之情，给了这只鹿在外观上继续做少女的能力，直到爱情舍弃她三次。要是爱情舍弃她三次，那么，不管会发生什么，她都必须永永远远恢复真实的原形。”

“第一个爱上她的是一位诗人，第二个是一位吟游歌手，第三个是一位骑士。各人都发现了她的真面目，也都放弃了自己的爱。因为谁可能会爱一个实际上是一只鹿的女士呢？”

好一阵子，只有钟表的嘀嗒声和隐约的喷泉声。

“最终，”皇家史官问，“爱情舍弃她三次之后呢？”

“最终，爱情舍弃她三次之后，”托克说，“她马上恢复了本真的原形。两个星期后，她被上次追猎的那个小伙子步步紧逼。这次，他的箭射中了她的心脏。”

钟表突然间敲响了七点。“你告诉我的是真的吗？”皇家史官问道。

“我的父亲那个时代的白鹿不知道自己的名字，因为野鹿根本没有名字。她记得的只有树木和田野，别的都不记得了。”老托克说。

“我怎么能对当今最自负的猎人克洛德讲这个故事呢？”皇家史官嚷道，“托克，我请求你，你可以怀疑，不过还是要抱着一些希望，这个公主说不定是真的吧。”

老人咳嗽了一声。“用‘可能’‘也许’和‘应该’，就能平衡怀疑或希望，这真荒唐。我知道上千种咒语的标识、符号和征兆。巫术会循环运行。”

老人和年轻的那个人都没有注意到作坊内一个昏暗角落里的一条黑影。那是孔多矮胖的身影，他神不知鬼不觉悄悄地溜进来，闭上眼睛，以免眼睛闪亮，让人看见，但他没有睡着。皇家史官一言不发，转过身，打开沉重的橡木门，走了出去。

他望着可爱的公主向他走来。只见她的头发间珠光闪闪，脚上的凉鞋金黄金黄的。他感到惊讶，一只鹿，要真是一只鹿的话，竟能如此完美地具有一位皇家千金的光彩形象。皇家史官不知道他能不能真正爱上一位小姐，她可能会随时开始啃树上的嫩叶，这要看那个让她着迷的特殊咒语是怎么下的。他叹了口气，摇了摇头，认定自己不会，并在心灵的档案室简略记下了这个结果。

无名少女的黑眼睛里出现了一些问号，但皇家史官摇了摇头，转过脸，叹了口气。“老人嘟嘟囔囔，唠唠叨叨，嘀嘀咕咕，咕咕哝哝，含含糊糊，说了一些零零碎碎、星星点点、旮旮旯旯的东西，满嘴都是要是啊、当初啊、当地啊、当时啊，结果是说的比什么都不说还少六倍。”

他鞠躬叹息又鞠躬，望着公主像一阵夏雨似的飘过草地，穿过一道大门，突然不见了踪影。

那天的午饭吃得非常安静，长长的宴会厅即使白天也十分昏暗，厚石墙的铁钉架上点起了火把。神秘的少女吃了好几颗核桃，没有喝酒，一点一点地咬了一片莴苣叶，那个样子使国王和他年长的儿子们不安地想起了前一天在魔法森林里的情景，也想起了那个行动敏捷、令人吃惊的猎物。克洛德、萨格和甘罗在椅子里不安地动来动去，不时地咕咕哝哝。乔恩王子的眼睛对无名公主流露出了款款柔情，很高兴看到，每当她抬起目光向桌子那端望去的时候，她就温柔地端详着他。侏儒孔多又一次躲在了铁盾牌下面他那个角落，没有漏掉任何的扫视或嘀咕，乌黑的眼睛从来没有离开过桌边的那些人影。

“要是你还吃得没有这好，”国王对公主说，“我就只好请教皇家猎场看守人。我是说，”他匆匆自己纠正说，“御医。”公主脸色变得绯红，乔恩怒视着父亲。为了掩饰自己的慌乱，国王大声召唤御用巫师。御用巫师突然从一团烟雾中冒了出来。

“我想我告诉过你，不要再从一团烟雾里冒出来了，”国王咆哮着说，“火药味会糟蹋酒香。这我告诉过你。”

“我忘了。”巫师说。

“就像其他人一样进屋。”国王说。

“是，陛下。”说着，巫师开始耍起了七个小小的金子和银子制成的月牙。

国王接着自己抱怨道：“他过去常常在一道闪电和一声霹雳中冒出来，就够坏的了。现在更坏的是，他使整个城堡都乌烟瘴气。这家伙的愚蠢花招配不上这样粉墨登场。普通林间巫师一天了解的比这个小丑十年里学的还多，哪怕他上过世界上最昂贵的巫师学校。呸！没有办法教会一个人骑马或施法。要么生来就会，要么根本不会。”

克洛德国王喃喃自语，捋了捋胡子，喝完一杯白葡萄酒后，从桌边站起来，登上弯弯曲曲的石梯。他还在自言自语，他的声音空洞地回响在城堡的大厅和房间：“我要弄清这个可爱小姐的名字，否则我就把一匹马生吞活剥。”他在房间门口听了听，只听御医躺在床上，时而哼哼唧唧，时而自我安慰：

“我再也走不了路……得了，得了，我们要马上下床；我们要马上让我们的脸颊红润……不，我们不能……是的，我们能……不，我们不能……是的，我们能。”

随后是长久的沉默。国王走进房间。御医正在量体温，但他看也没看就把水银柱摇落。

“作为医生，我必须每三个小时量一次体温，”他说，“但作为病人，我不能告诉自己体温是多少。”

“没有人告诉我这是怎么回事，”国王说，他不知道御医在说什么，“我来和你说话，是因为把你当成医生，而不是把你当成病人。”

“我相信我治不好自己，”病人说，“好了，好了，”他对自己反驳说，“我们不能对我们医生的技术失去信心，是吧？”

国王叹了口气，走到窗前，眺望城堡的庭院。他左手用力扯着右耳垂，讲起了他和儿子们追猎白鹿的故事，它怎么变成一位个子高挑、皮肤黝黑的可爱公主，那位公主记得的只有树木和田野，别的都不记得了。讲完故事后，国王问御医，那位公主不记得她和她父亲的名字，他认为是出了什么毛病。

“也许是她摔了一跤，”病人用医生的温和声音说，“或许是她喝了魔水或迷药。”

“她的头上没有瘀伤，”国王说，“她的眼睛瞳孔也没有放大。”

“嗯，”御医说，“我要是起床的话，一定会研究一下这个病例，但我怀疑自己起不了床。真正让我脸色红润吧！我相信我丝毫不知道自己出了什么毛病……得了，得了，我们不能让自己太激动了，对吗？”

“我不知道。”国王困惑地说。他瞧了瞧病人，叹了口气，离开房间，走向卧榻，躺在那里，辗转反侧，喃喃自语了一个小时。最后，他起床，脚步沉重地走下弯弯曲曲的石梯。

在阳光已经离去的东屋里，国王发现御用巫师借着十七支高烛的光，抛接七个小月亮和七颗银球。皇家史官正在对公主朗诵着那些虚构的国王名字。“兰格、伦格、林格、荣格、朗格，”他单调地说，“拉珀、莱珀、里珀、罗珀、鲁珀。”公主坐在早晨听他朗诵真实国王名字时坐的同一把椅子里。

御用巫师掉落了一个月亮和一颗球，就埋怨摇曳的烛光让他看不清楚。孔多蹲坐在角落里，黑眼睛盯着公主困惑的脸庞。

“圣托、森托、辛托、松托、桑托，”皇家史官低沉地念道，“塔拉塔、特勒塔、提利塔、托罗塔、图鲁塔。安丹、安登、安丁、安东、安顿。”

“在这摇曳的烛光中，这里搞的是什么哑剧啊？”克洛德吼道。

“我在编造一些国王的名字，希望其中一个能让公主眼睛为之一亮，”皇家史官说，“瓦拉雷尔、威拉雷尔、维拉雷尔、沃拉雷尔、乌拉雷尔。瓦克西、威克西、维克西、沃克西、伍克西。”他吟咏道。

“帕普、佩普、皮普、波普、珀普！”国王反感地嚷道，“听够了这瓦克西、威克西、维克西、沃克西、伍克西！这位可爱的小姐可能没有名字，但任何傻瓜都能看出，她不是虚构君主的虚构女儿。我要以一个国王的方式解决这个巧妙的问题，没有这么多没完没了莫名其妙的胡话！我此时此地就颁布命令，这位公主要给我的三个儿子各布置一项危险任务，谁先完成任务，谁就娶这个姑娘。要让一个女人清醒，没有什么能比得上结婚了。”

迷失的公主想到乔恩，眼睛发亮；想到甘罗，神情严肃；想到萨格，则心惊胆战。

“当明天太阳升到天顶的时候，”克洛德说，“这位小姐要给我的三个儿子各布置一项危险的任务。我要用一桶祖母绿打赌，萨格会首先完成任务回来。你们哪个人用同样多的宝石来赌甘罗会赢啊？”

孔多低沉的声音传来，打破了小小的寂静，说道：“一桶等重的祖母绿，年轻的乔恩王子会娶到这位小姐。”

克洛德国王的笑声震撼了厚厚的墙壁。“一言为定，我的傻侏儒。”他大声嚷道。

公主站起来，对国王行屈膝礼，然后走出房间。孔多和巫师尾随其后。当克洛德国王要走的时候，皇家史官用颤抖的声音开口说道：“有一个故事，托克说的是……”

“不要对我说托克讲的故事，”国王说，“这个老傻瓜过去打报告说有彗星，其实那是萤火虫。他的一百座钟表都是偶尔报时。他把日晷放在阴影处。不要对我说托克讲的故事。”

内务大臣没有敲门直接走了进来，对国王鞠了一躬，说道：“陛下，皇室天文学家请求马上觐见。天空中某个东西出了岔子。”

“让他进来！让他进来！”克洛德喊道，“不要站在那里鞠躬点头——让他进来！”

内务大臣鞠躬，点头，退下。

“我的父亲喜欢这繁文缛节，”克洛德说，“我却觉得没必要用矮胖的中间人。要是有人想来见我，就让他来见我好了。”

有人敲门，随后皇室天文学家帕斯走进了房间。他脸色发红，是一个年轻人，身穿红色长袍，红眼睛透过红色镜片凝视着。

“陛下，”他说，“就在刚才一颗巨大的红色彗星差点儿撞上地球。它发出了一种可怕的咝咝声，就像烙铁插进水里一样。”

“它们这样是冲我来的，”克洛德说，“一切都是冲我来的。”他大步走出了房间，用力关门，所有花名册都突然打开，所有纸页都在风中哗啦啦飘动。

第二天，当太阳升到天顶的时候，在一个专门用于皇家典礼的圆形大屋里，迷失的小姐坐在一把高脚雕花金椅中，命令三个王子各自单膝跪在她的面前，国王和皇家史官旁观着。

公主说道：“萨格王子，要是你想赢得我牵手，那我就委派你单枪匹马到危险的森林去猎杀瑟顿小树林里的大蓝野猪，把它的金獠牙给我带来，放在我的脚边。”

“一百名骑士因去危险森林猎捕瑟顿小树林里的大蓝野猪而送了命！”萨格喊道。

“伟大的萨格王子没有猎捕过比白鹿更危险的动物吗？”公主问。萨格鞠躬，吻了吻少女的手。过了一会儿，圆厅里就传来了隆隆的马蹄声。

轮到甘罗下跪了。公主说：“甘罗王子，要是你想赢得我牵手，我就委派你去征服龙谷守护罗拉洛圣剑的七头龙，并把罗拉洛圣剑给我带回来，放在我的脚边。”

“一百名骑士为了设法征服龙谷的七头龙而送了命！”他嚷道。

“伟大的甘罗王子没有猎捕过比白鹿更危险的动物吗？”公主问。甘罗王子鞠躬，吻了吻少女的手。过了一会儿，圆厅里就传来了隆隆的马蹄声。

乔恩是最后一个下跪的。公主说：“乔恩王子，要是你想赢得我的手和心，我就委派你去击败守卫距离城堡大门十里格远的查多樱桃园的貘貘，并给我带回一只装满一千颗樱桃的银杯，放在我的脚边。”

克洛德国王在大橡木椅里倾身向前。“貘貘是三百年前我父亲的父亲的父亲的父亲为了吓跑大鹏鸟，用黏土和檀香木做的一个怪物，大鹏鸟过去常常吃光树上的樱桃。”他大声说道。

“一百个小孩子曾经在查多樱桃园那个可怕的貘貘身上刻下自己的名字！”乔恩嚷道。

“难道伟大的乔恩王子猎捕过的动物都比白鹿危险吗？”公主问道。

乔恩王子鞠躬，吻了吻少女的手。过了一会儿，圆厅里就传来了隆隆的马蹄声。

公主站起来，对国王行过屈膝礼，走上弯弯曲曲的石梯，去照料御医和城堡巫师。巫师想设法摘下自己的头，再放回原处，只是扭伤了脖子，所以在卧床养病。

克洛德国王在房间里走来走去，心不在焉地用大拇指甲嗒嗒嗒敲着墙上挂的那些盾牌，使它们叮当作响。“她有一张可爱的脸蛋，”他说，“我喜欢这个孩子。不过，我有一种最奇特的感觉，就是她在以微微惊慌的样子望着我，就像一只动物透过矮树丛窥视着似的。”

皇家史官把右手食指放在他的鼻子旁边，说道：“也许像一只受惊的小鹿，在小杨柳丛中瑟瑟发抖？”

国王飞快地转向他，咆哮着说道：“不，不是像一只受惊的小鹿在小杨柳丛中瑟瑟发抖！我整个晚上都是浅睡，听到了每一次唧唧唧、啸啸啸、嗡嗡嗡和飒飒飒的声音，而且那个方向不断地传来咕隆咕隆的声音。”他指向北方稍微偏西的地方，“我每天夜里都能听见。”

“他们说林间巫师会让东西从月亮上弹跳下来。可能就是这样。”皇家史官说。

国王叹了口气，说道：“一个东西上千次嘀嗒嘀嗒穿过我的脑海，嘀嗒咕隆，嘀嗒咕隆，嘀嗒咕隆，整夜响个不停。”他大步走向皇家史官。“托克讲了个什么故事？”他问道。

皇家史官咳嗽了一声。“托克讲的故事，”他说，“弯来绕去。它保持平衡，以这样那样的方式表达是与非、能与不能、半斤八两。”

“胡言乱语，胡言乱语，胡言乱语，”国王说，“胡说八道，胡说八道，胡说八道。我没有时间，也没有心情来听诡辩和猜谜。托克的故事弯来绕去，还没有陀螺有意思。”

“我会尽力而为。”说着，皇家史官就讲了托克父亲的那只鹿的故事，同时自己还在多处添油加醋，不时偏离主题。

国王听的时候，脸色由红变紫，由紫变灰。等终于能发声的时候，他声音沙哑地说道：“祈求上帝，我们的鹿跟托克父亲的鹿不一样。”皇家史官双手掌心朝上。

“正如托克所说，巫术会循环运行。换句话说，咒语是以成套体系设置的。要是某个特例是这样，这个特殊种类的所有相同特例就都一样。要是某个无赖没有从原来书架上抽走我的《巫术史》，我就能向你说明我的意思。这本史书是你父亲的皇家史官和你父亲的皇家史官的父亲的父亲编撰的。它没有索引和术语表，书页都折了角，有了褐斑。”

“什么‘褐斑’？”克洛德问。

“《巫术史》，”皇家史官说，“你没有在听我说吗？”

“我想知道‘褐斑’是什么意思！”克洛德大声嚷道。

“噢，就是‘长了斑点’。”皇家史官说。

“噢，发现了(2)！”国王模仿说，“碰巧我的房间里有《巫术史》。我夜里睡不着的时候，就一直在看。”他轻轻地拍了拍手，一个身穿黄衣服的小个子出现了，克洛德吩咐他去寝宫拿下来那本史书。“带三个人帮你去拿。”克洛德说。

“谁要从皇家藏书室拿走《巫术史》或其他书，就应该填写正规的表格。”皇家史官生硬地说。

“我不会登记，不会打标签，不会签字，不会签名，”克洛德说，“要是我想要一本书，我就会拿来。”

国王和皇家史官开始在房间里反向走来走去，经过彼此身边的时候，各自咕哝和叹息。不久，四个身穿黄衣服的小个子弯腰抬起一本古老的巫术大书，蹒跚着走进房间。他们把书放在地上，离开了房间。皇家史官开始翻动那些落满灰尘的泛黄的书页，一边眯眼看，一边咳嗽。

他最后说道：“‘鹿’的词条下只有少女们变成鹿又变回原形的记录和报告，一切都美好、整洁、标准，一切都整洁、美好、规范。每个解除魔咒的少女都知道自己的名字。书里就是这样说的。”

“那就看看其他词条！”国王大声吼道。

“比如？”皇家史官问道，“举例来说？”

“看看少女们失忆的词条！”克洛德大叫道。“看看‘失’开头的词条！”

“失忆在这种特例中归于‘忆’开头的词条下。”皇家史官说。

“怎么会，怎么能，怎么可能这样？”克洛德怒喝道。

皇家史官的声音生硬而坚定：“陛下，正确的列项是：冒号、前引号、忆、少女们的、失、句号、后引号。”

国王闭上左眼，然后又睁开，闭上右眼，声音低沉而阴森：“我毫不怀疑‘猫咪（Pussycat）’归在Q开头的词条下，‘糊涂猴（Monkey-muddle）’归在R开头的词条下，‘混驴（Donkey-daddle）’归在S开头的词条下。查查X、Y或Z开头的词条下有没有这个无名孩子的可怜秘密，不过要查查看！”墙上的那些盾牌簌簌颤抖。

皇家史官翻到了M词条，一路查到了“魔法（Magic）”“奇迹（Miracle）”“神秘（Mystery）”和“痄腮（Mumps）”，终于在“耗子（Mice）”和“江湖骗子（Mountebank）”之间查到了他要找的词条。皇家史官念了十几页，不断地大喊“啊”“噢”“噢”“啊”，克洛德国王走来走去，最后大声嚷道：“不要瞎号了，给我念念写的是什么。”

皇家史官摇了摇头。“你听后只会发火。里面充满了从句、词组和停顿符号，还有旁注、引语，拉丁文和希腊文的‘即’‘出处同上’‘大约’‘原文如此’。”

克洛德吼道：“总结，那就用普通平常的话总结，不要太多废话和鸟语。”

皇家史官脸色通红，说道：“我们在M词条下查到九个魔法故事，每个故事里都有一只树林和田野里的鹿变为女人。”

“它们为什么会变成女人？”克洛德问道。

皇家史官说得既缓慢又有耐心：“一是因为那只鹿救了一位巫师的命。二是因为邪恶的巫师想捉弄人们，让他们伤心。”

“我要是成为全世界的君王，”克洛德说，“就会设法终止巫术，否则就折断我的脊椎。在如此混乱和任性中，谁知道哪个是自己的猎犬，哪个是自己的侄女？”

皇家史官说：“这九个魔法故事中有两件事是真实的。第一，少女们都没有名字，她们记得的只有树木和田野，别的都不记得了。”

“哈！”克洛德说。

“另外，咒语也都一样。这里记录的每个奇怪的故事都表明，这只鹿被步步紧逼，无处可逃。”

“嗬！”克洛德说。

“因此，那只鹿当时当地就变成了一位少女，一位个子高挑、皮肤黝黑的可爱少女，一看就是公主。”

“嚯！”克洛德叹了口气，重重地坐在凳子上。

皇家史官走来走去，然后站住不动，举起一只手。“这些假女人、这些假少女、这些迷惑人的女子、这些冒牌公主，都有一种令人不安的能力。”

“这是什么能力？”克洛德声音沙哑地问道。

“真心爱她们，好好爱她们，那么，任何东西都破不了这个咒语。”皇家史官停顿了一会儿，然后接着说道，“但要是爱情舍弃她们三次，她们就会转眼消失。”

克洛德一跃而起，在房间里大步走来走去。“记录一项法令。”最后，他说。皇家史官从架子上的一张蛛网后面拿出墨水和鹅毛笔，又从一面盾牌后面抽出一张羊皮纸，坐在地上，盘起了腿。克洛德闭上眼睛，说道：“简单地写，清晰地写：我的任何一个儿子都不会娶一只鹿。”

“任何外表或外貌的鹿，”皇家史官说，“无论是伪装打扮形状外观，还是影像模拟，或者是拙劣模仿或假扮——”

“是谁在发布法令？”克洛德质问道。

皇家史官声音单调而坚定地说：“你的法令再清楚不过了。法令应该这样写，要是你改变了主意，那个观点就可以否认、否定和否决。”

“删除这道法令。”国王说。看上去他难过了一会儿，随后就狂笑起来。“我们的窘境的确让人伤心，但我愿意献出我的半壁江山，就是想看一下这个时代第二伟大的猎人萨格在咒语破解那天醒来的时候，看到他的枕边不是乌黑的秀发和红宝石般的嘴唇，而是毛茸茸的耳朵和天鹅绒似的鼻孔，他是什么表情！”

国王的笑声产生的力量，使他在房间里的四面墙之间蹦来蹦去，就像箱子里弹跳的球一样。他想到甘罗，继而想到乔恩，想到两人跟那位小姐实实在在的原形面对面的时候，他的笑声和蹦跳更欢了——那是一个在沼泽而不在炉边，在泥塘而不在闺房，在盐泽地而不在银碗边的动物。

国王好久才克制住自己，说道：“这整个虚幻闹剧中最让我开心的，就是想到乔恩，想到弹里拉琴和里拉琴的乔恩发现自己赢得了这个基督教世界跑得最快的鹿的心和蹄子的情景。”他在椅子上坐下来，擦去眼里笑出来的眼泪。皇家史官转了个圈，穿过房间，又返回来，搅动了烛火。克洛德连叹了三声，说道：“这个少女已经点亮了我的内心——这不能否认。我希望我能颁布命令她绝不是一只鹿。”

“你不能那样做。”皇家史官说。

“我能做什么？”克洛德问。

“等等看你会看到什么，看你会望到什么，记住一是一次，二是二次，三是三次，比眨眼更快的是瞬间。”

“叹气，叹气，叹气，”国王说，“我已经叹够了气。我们必须提醒这位公主她是一只鹿。说不定她会优雅地离开。”

“她不能那样做，”皇家史官大为震惊地说，“你发布命令，这只动物给你的儿子们布置了一组危险任务。她现在等着最快回来的那位。这件事已经完全说定了。”

“我当时还以为她是公主呢。”克洛德说。

皇家史官耸了耸肩，说道：“陛下，既然你发布命令让她那样，那她就是公主。实际上，暂时性的。”

国王抬起头，发出了一声大吼，那吼声就如同被一群魔法老鼠折磨的狮子。他咚咚咚大步走到门口，墙上的盾牌都叮当作响。“我希望我所有的儿子都迷路，”克洛德说，“那倒是一条出路。”

“这是他们的事儿，”皇家史官说，“而不是你的事儿。你要照管这只漂亮的动物，直到托克见到的大黑行星跟地球相撞，把我们大家统统杀死。”

克洛德国王叹了口气，沉下脸来，咆哮着说道：“托克看到的不是什么大黑行星，只是一片落叶或一只飞鸟。为什么好心的克洛德国王一定要被瞎眼小丑、卑鄙小丑和世界上所有邪恶的巫师困扰呢？”

他冲出房间，咚地关上门，用的力掀起了一阵风，把皇家史官刮倒，面朝下趴在了地上。





萨格王子的危险任务


萨格王子骑马所走的大路渐渐地变成了一条弯曲小路，小路蜿蜒穿过枝干虬曲、摇摇欲坠的树木，这些树木就像被冰冻的舞动的人影。所有的树木都滴渗着一种黏稠的液体，与其说是散发，不如说是让空气沾上了一种浓郁的甜香，这浓郁的甜香时隐时现时现时隐又时隐时现。

“这浓郁的甜香，”萨格喃喃自语，“现在飘起，也曾经飘起，不适合人的鼻子闻，还欺骗人的思想。三乘以二是八，”他说，“一等于十。”

一片令人毛骨悚然的淡蓝色烟雾飘过树林，有的像指环，有的像铁箍，有的像颈圈。

“我不相信这种黏稠东西——”高个王子咬着嘴唇。“哈（萨）格真收（受）够了。”(3)

“懒痒痒（洋洋）的月亮在管（松）树丛里水滴答（耍嘴皮子），”一个声音说，那种腔调因某种原因惹闹（恼）了哈格（萨格）。“我在树蹲（crouch）上面呢。”那个声音继续说道。

“你是说树杈（crotch）吧？”说着，萨格看到头顶上方几英尺处一个身体稍圆、有些谢顶的男人。

“正好相反，”那个人说，“你在疼痛时遇到的是嘎吱嘎吱（crunch）。”

“痛的时候应该是退缩皱眉（wince）。”萨格生气地说。

“你把词语都剁碎（mince）了。”圆胖子反驳说。

“不管怎样，那是耍嘴皮子（glibbers），”萨格傲慢地说，“不是你刚说的水滴答（globbers）。这个词应该是愉快失态(4)。”

“啊，你说的可是心态心情（mood），”圆胖子说。“我刚才指的是月亮（moon）。在这片特殊的树林里，注意含有D和N的词非常重要。你要是抓住（grasp）我的意思，就不会过于特殊了。”

“没有人会抢（grab）你。”说着，萨格露出了上牙，“此外，我讨厌你提到它的时候说‘农夫沟渠’（peasant trench）。”

那个人低头盯着萨格，冷淡地说道：“我不在乎你说什么。我说的就是耍嘴皮。”

在一棵树上的高处，一座肿（钟）慢慢撬（敲）响。

“我想知道极点（几点）了？”萨格问。

“陆点八（六点半），”那个人说，“也可能怕（八）点半或死（四）点三刻。我没有月亮回答问题。”

“是你没有心情。”萨格说。

“他先是跟我搭讪，后来又告诉我说我没有参与什么，”那个人说，“我靠着这个树蹲，是为了避开像你这样的麻烦鬼，让那些拉大鬼继续走。”

“你是想说邋遢鬼吧。”萨格庄严地说。

“现在他告诉我说我在想什么。”那个人说。

“蹲是你做什么，不是你在哪里。”萨格说。

“我怎么能在我不在的地方做任何事儿呢？”那个人问，“我有些想下去痛打你一顿。”

萨格哈哈大笑。

“说得对，”那个人抱怨说，“嘲笑一个只是心里想想的人。”他抽了一下鼻子，“一个拄拐的人。”

“你蹲伏（crouch）在树杈（crotch）上，但你没有拐杖（crutch）支撑。”萨格说。

那个人突然哭了起来。“说得对，”他大声叫道，“之所以嘲笑一个人，是因为他没有拐杖。”他向萨格挥了挥拳头，喊道，“诅咒你们这两匹马(5)！”

四只红雀在缠绕的灌木丛里叽叽喳叽叽喳地叫着，萨格闭嘴屏息，又合上眼睛，骑马疾驰过臭烘烘的烟圈和黏糊糊的气味。过了好一阵子，他骑出了枝干虬曲、摇摇欲坠的树林，眼前出现了闪亮的欢乐谷。

空气中闪耀着又高又细的水晶火花，这使三个走向萨格的男人显得比实际更加高大。这三个人站在萨格的马旁边，鞠躬微笑又鞠躬。萨格看到每人手里都拿着一副跟各自的脸完全一样的面具，但第一副面具严厉，第二副面具悲伤，第三副面具庄严。第一个人咯咯笑，第二个人哧哧笑，第三个人哈哈笑。第一个人鞠躬说话：“我们昨天和明天戴面具。”

第二个说：“因为那些悲伤的日子从未到来——”

第三个人说：“我们不知道任何悲伤。”他向萨格挥了挥面具。“我的名字叫瓦格，这个叫加格，那个叫贾格。”

“我的名字，”萨格说，“叫萨格。”

“可爱的名字。”瓦格说。

“迷人的名字。”加格说。

“真正绚丽的名字。”贾格说，“真希望我给自己起名的时候想到了这个名字。”

“欢迎来到欢乐谷，”瓦格说，“全世界最优美的小小地方，表示最最热烈的欢迎，萨格。你是我们认识的最出色、最伟大的王子。”

“你们并不很了解我。”萨格说。

“我们对你的了解十分完全。”瓦格说。

“我们对你的了解十分惊人。”加格说。

“我们对你的了解十分出色。”贾格说。

萨格皱了皱眉，说道：“我寻找去危险森林中的瑟顿林的路。我必须继续骑马前进。我的时间不多了。”

“危险森林太远了，一天你绝对走不到。”瓦格说。

“一个月也走不到。”加格说。

“一年也走不到。”贾格说，“我们知道那个地方，是一个真正美妙的地方。”

“一个迷人的地方。”加格说。

“一个可爱的地方。”瓦格说。

萨格骑在焦躁不安的马背上，也变得焦躁不安。“告诉我，那些危险是不是变得更加可怕，那些怪兽已经长大了吗？”

三个人互相勾肩搭背，哈哈大笑，直笑得哭起来，又哭得笑起来。

瓦格咯咯笑道：“无论是这里、那里还是任何地方，都没有危险和怪兽。”

“忘记那些危险吧。”加格哧哧笑道。

“不要想那些怪兽了。”贾格哈哈笑道。

三个人笑了又哭哭了又笑。

“哪条路通向危险森林？”萨格喝问道，哭笑声戛然而止。

“一直向前走。”瓦格说。

“沿着‘再见’前进。”加格说。

“经过‘今日时刻’。”贾格说。

三个人开始咯咯咯、哧哧哧、哈哈哈地笑了起来，萨格策马而去，一直向前跑啊跑，穿过了绿色山谷，山谷里欢声笑语、喜气洋洋、乐不可支。

他沿着“再见”向前骑——那是一条欢快闪亮的小溪——经过“今日时刻”——那是一座巨钟，表盘上画着一张笑脸。小山从两边后退消失，草从绿色变成了褐色，然后又变成了灰色。一个快乐的男人站在欢乐谷的尽头，当萨格一闪而过的时候，那个人大喊“抓住今天”。

路面现在崎岖坎坷，鹅群嘎嘎嘎叫着经过，荆棘从荆棘树上掉落，像匕首似的扎进泥土。当萨格接近危险森林边缘的时候，天气发生了可怕的变化。穿过一片薄雾缭绕的藓沼，还有一场玻璃风暴。飓风、季风和浪潮从海上一阵阵袭来，龙卷风和旋风撕裂了地壳，干冷的西北风从山上呼啸而下。

要游过一条音乐小溪，温柔的溪水沉睡般摇晃，甜美地歌唱，萨格只好拼命挣脱睡意，免得淹死。他的黑马因害怕而嘶鸣，但国王的儿子驱策它继续前行，黑马一路飞驰过危险的树林。一阵大风平地而起，树木在黑马和骑手的前后左右纷纷倒下。一些大洞像巨人的嘴巴一样在地面开合，但萨格引导黑马绕过跨过穿过，不断前行。

大火席卷森林，但萨格策马飞奔，安然而过。圣杯般大的冰雹从四面八方砸下，但他都一一避开。电闪雷鸣，大雨倾盆，但萨格王子一路歌唱，策马前行。

瑟顿林的黑色树木终于隐隐呈现，这是大蓝野猪出没的地方。萨格下马，长矛在手，蹑手蹑脚，小心前行。一种可怕的声音震耳欲聋，那是此起彼伏的鼾声。萨格紧握长矛，循声而去，那好像是从一棵嗷嗷树脚下传来的。让萨格王子大为惊讶的是，瑟顿林的大蓝野猪在嗷嗷树下睡得鼾声阵阵，每三十年只睁三十次眼，大眼睛闭着，巨大的两肋起伏着。

萨格轻快地走上前去，但怪兽梦见危险逼近，睁开一只眼，挣扎着站起来，用力大声叫喊：“走走走走走——开。”

为时已晚。萨格的长矛直刺向蓝野猪的心脏。瑟顿林的蓝野猪轰然倒地，给自己砸出了一个坟墓。

萨格向下伸手，折断了金獠牙，就像它们是冰柱一般易如反掌。过了一会儿，他骑马返回，穿过险恶的树林。

直径十英尺的圆石横横竖竖横七竖八纵横交错挡在他的路上，嗡嗡鸟一大群一大群地飞扑向萨格的头，剪刀似的嘴开开合合。王子和他的黑色战马以惊人的跳跃和闪避跳过大圆石，躲开嗡嗡鸟，终于冲进了开阔地，然后手握大蓝野猪闪亮的金獠牙，奔向父王的城堡。

从克洛德国王城堡一间高屋的高窗，公主两眼圆睁，浑身颤抖，注视着她的追求者们走过的道路，只见那里像树枝形烛台一样分成三个岔道。萨格走的是靠右那条路，甘罗走的是靠左那条路，乔恩则是径直向前走。

神秘的少女放眼望去，只见任何道路上都没有扬起尘土，也没有人或马出现的迹象。她满怀希望和热切之情望着中间那条路，对右边和左边的路充满了恐慌和惊惧。

托克静静地坐在昏暗的作坊里，设法想起一些有关“时间”和“悲伤”的清冷精美的小诗。

御用巫师蹲在塔楼里自己房间的地板上，对着一块普通石头一边摆动手指，一边喊着咒语，设法把它变成金子。但什么也没有发生。御医还躺在床上，一边辱骂，一边安慰自己，尽力伸长舌头，看看舌苔是不是变厚了。“得了，得了。”他说。“我们可以把舌头伸得比这更长，不能吗？”他兴高采烈地问。“不，我们不能。”他闷闷不乐地答道。

在皇家藏书室里，皇家史官坐在高脚桌边的高凳上，在私人日记里记录了一条：“尽管你知道的那个人烦恼焦躁、大呼小叫、牢骚不满，但今天还是要定下一件事，就是我们从前天夜里起一直在城堡里款待的所谓公主，实际上，从出身和命运来说，是一只普通的鹿。是我发现了这只不幸的野兽悲伤的秘密。”

克洛德国王独自坐在宴会厅里的长桌主位，一边用大拇指和食指捏开核桃，一边沉思着，在去拜访公主让她了解她的可怜处境之前，喝点酒是不是明智之举。他认定叫酒来喝并不是好主意，就继续捏起了核桃。

他对这件事进退两难、举棋不定，目光明了又暗暗了又明。他捏开最后一颗核桃，连壳慢慢地吃着，随后拍了一下桌面，装核桃的银碗跳离了桌子，叮当一声落在了地上。“管家！”克洛德大声喊道：“酒！”

孔多坐在一棵枝繁叶茂、能遮蔽住他的身形的高树上，仔细察看那三条通向危险的道路。他把头转向左边，透过树叶，可以看到公主站在高屋里的高窗边。

在皇家猎场看守人的门房里，皇家猎场看守人的妻子一边重新收拾架子上的瓦罐，一边回头对皇家猎场看守人说着话：“我一个字也不相信，我不在乎你说什么。你要是问我，那她从来就不是一只鹿。他们是编故事，好来掩盖自己的行为。你们男人都一样。是走火入魔的公主，的确是！是走火入魔的荡妇！我知道她这种人。她在森林里游荡，向他们挥手！”

皇家猎场看守人的妻子拿起一个瓦罐，用布狠狠地擦了擦，又放下来。“高雅，你硬要说她高雅。我偏说她肮脏。说什么二十一岁，她都快三十岁了。”皇家猎场看守人的妻子又拿起另一只瓦罐擦啊擦擦个不停。“城堡肯定需要女人来收拾，里面到处都是碎玻璃和蜘蛛网。王后殿下死了，太不幸了，可怜的人儿。我总是说，他喝醉时打她。”

她退得离架子远了几步，欣赏自己的成果。

“她要是公主，那我毫不怀疑她是老国王帕奇的一个女儿——我应该说，是七个女儿中的长女。她跟她们一样厚颜无耻……喂，怎么了？……豹子吃了你的舌头吗？”

皇家猎场看守人没有回答，坐在椅子里，两手抄在腹部，很快便陷入熟睡。





甘罗王子的危险任务


甘罗王子先是一路向左，再向右，然后又向左，最后穿过一片寂静的树林，来到了一条白色小路上。马铃叮当沿着小路奔跑的时候，甘罗惊讶地盯着，这是一种他从未见过的森林。树上挂着各种标牌和铭文……“失踪宝宝认领。”“你等待时巨人们杀了人。”“7里格靴子现在6.98。”“让我们叫醒你的睡美人。”“我们把你放在瓮上，人们把你放在底座上。”“咨询潘廷和杨格。”“来找格雷罗，甚至比找到真正的圣杯还强。”“马车馅饼、南瓜车轮、捕马器、鼠鞋。”

让甘罗张大嘴巴最感兴趣的一张标牌上写道：“参观龙谷的七头龙。除月亮日和疯癫日之外，都免费。”

在甘罗惊讶不已环顾四周的时候，一个头戴银帽、身穿铜衣的男人向他致敬。

“兄弟，你的羊皮纸。”那个身穿铜衣的男人说。

“我不是你的兄弟，我的名字叫甘罗王子。”王子困惑地说。

“在将来的森林里，人人都是兄弟。”这个人说。

“这听上去友好，但又令人迷惑。”甘罗说，“兄弟，我没有羊皮纸。”这个人神情严肃了一会儿，随后闭上一只眼睛，低声说道：“从外表看，你是一位机智聪明的绅士。现在刚好我还有一套合适的羊皮纸，你可以用一首歌来交换。”

“我唱什么歌呢？”甘罗问。

“在将来的森林里，一首歌就是三大颗祖母绿，”这个人答道，“你有三大颗祖母绿吗？”

甘罗从马鞍上的一个麻袋里掏出三颗祖母绿，送给那个人。那个人随即递给王子一张红色羊皮纸、一张蓝色羊皮纸和一张白色羊皮纸。

“红色羊皮纸给白衣人，蓝色羊皮纸给红衣人，白色羊皮纸给蓝衣人，”他说，“这就对大家都不简单了。”铜衣人用手指碰了一下帽子，就走开了。

甘罗骑马沿着树林边缘走，来到另一条小路，然后顺着那条小路，一直骑到了一个白衣人的身边。

甘罗把红色羊皮纸给白衣人。“你给我指一下通向龙谷七头龙的路好吗？”王子问道。白衣人正在盯着红色羊皮纸。

“这不是一张名副其实的羊皮纸，”白衣人说，“密封不见了，签名可疑，标识是昨天的。”他神情严肃了一会儿，随后闭上一只眼睛，低声说道：“从外表看，你是一位勇敢高贵的绅士。”他说，“你此行是为了一项极其危险的使命，我要说错了，就让我身穿绿色。我可以撕掉这张羊皮纸，让你过去，也不在那棵树上给你打叉说明有一位骑士曾经走过这条路，但这样太安全，没办法让你不舒服，也没办法让我不舒服。我会更换密封、签名和标识，让羊皮纸变得恰到好处。兄弟，这一切就一首歌，这一切就一首歌。那样做大家会更危险。”

甘罗王子叹了口气，从麻袋里掏出三颗祖母绿送给这个人，继续赶路，直至来到蓝衣人的身边。

蓝衣人接过白色羊皮纸，严肃地待了一会儿，随后闭上一只眼睛，低声说：

“兄弟，从外表看，你是一个有学问、有眼力的人。”他说，“但我不能让你经过，除非你证明你的阅读能力，你、我或是任何人怎么能读懂这个呢？”他把羊皮纸还给甘罗，甘罗看到纸上的字只有举到镜子前面才能读。

“没有镜子，我读不了这些字。”甘罗王子嚷道。

蓝衣人从袖子里拿出一面象牙框的银镜，递给皱眉的王子。“现在念一下镜子里的铭文吧。”他说。

甘罗用下巴夹住羊皮纸，把镜子举到面前，念道：“忘记过去，享受现在，未来会自己照顾自己。”

甘罗王子让羊皮纸飘落到地上，说道：“我有一种奇怪的感觉，就是我既不在这里也不在那里，既不是此时也不是彼时。我陷入了前天和后天之间的某个地方。”

蓝衣人神情严肃了一会儿。“那是因为你已经从过去骑进了未来。”说着，他闭上了一只眼睛。“为了未来，你放弃过去，却失去了现在。”他低声说道。“你曾拥有过去，你看到了关于自己的未来，但你没有现在。现在你手里正好有一份非常精美的礼物——一份适合公主的象牙白银做的礼物。它是伏尔甘做成的，送给了维纳斯，维纳斯把它留给了克娄巴特拉，克娄巴特拉把它送给了伊索尔德(6)，伊索尔德又把它遗赠给了我的祖母。你用一首歌就可以拥有它。”

甘罗王子叹了口气，从袋子里掏出三颗祖母绿宝石，送给了蓝衣人。

“哪条路通向龙谷里那条守卫罗拉洛圣剑的七头龙？”他耐心地问道。

“右转，再右转，再右转，再右转。”蓝衣人答道。

“可是，那样我会绕着一个正方形转一圈，又回到原地。”甘罗说。

“那样大家印象会深刻得多。”蓝衣人边走边说道，他还咔咔地敲着他的祖母绿。

克洛德国王的二儿子按照指点，绕着正方形小路骑行；当回到出发点的时候，他发现一个红衣人在等着他。

“给我你的蓝色羊皮纸。”红衣人说。甘罗把羊皮纸递给他。

“哪条路通向龙谷里那条守卫罗拉洛圣剑的七头龙？”王子问道。

红衣人神情严肃地待一会儿，随后闭上一只眼睛，低声说：

“从外表看，你是一位精明机灵的绅士，”他说，“闭上眼睛，兄弟。”甘罗闭上眼睛，红衣人把蓝色羊皮纸藏到了一块石头下面。“兄弟，睁开眼睛吧。”他说。于是，甘罗睁开眼睛。“你看到我手里拿的蓝色羊皮纸了吗？”这个人问道，“不，你看不见，因为我已经使它隐形了。我能用同样的方式使你和你的马隐形，以便你能骑到龙谷的七头龙那里，神不知鬼不觉地取走罗拉洛的圣剑。你唱三首歌，我就愿意这样效劳。”

甘罗从麻袋里掏出九颗祖母绿，送给红衣人。袋子里只剩下十二颗了。

“你现在隐身了，人和龙都看不见你，”对方说，“那样大家更容易迷惑。”

“哪条路通向龙谷里那条七头龙那里？”甘罗问道。

“困难路，”红衣人说，“向下再向下，转圈再转圈，穿过阿塔尼斯的呜咽林。”

“我怎么能辨认出这片林子呢？”甘罗问。

“林子上空有无数月亮，林子里有一朵朵红玫瑰，还有一座座蓝房子，每座房子里都坐着一个为远去的恋人悲啼的孤独少女。不要害怕可怕的党主民的吼叫，也不要害怕乖戾的党和共的自吹自擂(7)，一直向前骑。”

“我穿过林子之后呢？”王子问。

“向右转，跟着一小道白光走。”红衣人一边轻摇着祖母绿，一边说道。

甘罗骑啊骑，一直来到了阿塔尼斯的小树林。红玫瑰的芬芳袭向他的鼻孔，无数月亮的光线让他眼花缭乱，而孤独少女的呜咽声震耳欲聋，他策马飞奔，能多快就多快，一直跑到了一条弯弯曲曲的道路之后，才向右转。前面突然出现了一小束白光，他跟着那束光，绕了一圈又一圈，一路向下走。

不久，甘罗王子听到了许多人说笑喊唱的声音，随后看到路边摆着桌子，有的桌子上摆放着水果和肉，有的桌子上堆着他从未见过的各种各样的小玩意、小摆设和小饰物。

树上挂着他做梦都未想到的沉甸甸的乐器，人们穿着奇妙的服装，跳着奇妙的舞步，向下再向下，转圈再转圈。在人们的说话声上方，一种令人惊恐的奇怪声音在嗡嗡嗡、呼呼呼、铃铃铃、砰砰砰响个不停。

“给，兄弟！”一个穿着青一块乌一块的衣服的人叫道，他递给甘罗七颗小球，“十二颗祖母绿就可以换七颗球！试试运气吧！”

“你递给我这些球，”甘罗困惑地说，“可你看不见我，因为我已经被隐形了。”

“我当然看得见你，”那个人说，“明明白白，真真切切，奇丑无比。买下这些球，把它们扔进去。”

“我不明白你在说什么。”王子困惑地说。

“瞧，兄弟，”那个人说，“十二颗祖母绿让你得到七颗球。你把这些球抛向龙谷的七头龙，它就在那边的条纹帐篷里——它是这个时代最伟大的机械奇迹，尽管毫无意义，但令人惊叹。那七个头转啊转转个不停。试试运气，试试本领！朝七个头的每张嘴里扔进一颗球，你就会赢得真正唯一的罗拉洛圣剑。扔中六颗球，两块金砖。五颗球，一盒糖。四颗球，一把钥匙。三颗球赢玫瑰一朵。就这样来，就这样来。”

这个人送给了甘罗七颗球，拿走了他那袋祖母绿。“兄弟，你不可能赢，”他说，“我不可能输。这对大家都光明正大。”他神情严肃了一会儿，随后闭上一只眼睛，低声说：

“从外表看，你是一位诚实正直的绅士，”他说，“现在，要是机械龙侧面的那把大钥匙没有上发条，那七个头就不会转啊转个不停，你就能向七个头的每张嘴里投进一颗球，赢得圣剑。我为你效一点力，向你透露这个秘密，只求你马背上的金马鞍作为回报。”

甘罗晕头转向，说不出一个字来。他默默地大步走进条纹帐篷，果然在那里看到了七头龙。它的七个头现在都一动不动，嘴巴张开。巨大的两爪之间躺着那把闪闪发光的剑，他为这把剑受的罪太多了。甘罗把那些球一个接一个地投进了一张张张开的嘴巴，随后走过去，拿起罗拉洛的圣剑，离开了条纹帐篷。他离开帐篷的时候，一个神情疲惫的小个子男人现身，走向一个铁箱，打开来，从完全一样的一百把剑中取出一把，放在机械龙的两爪之间，打了个哈欠，就拖着脚步走开了。

在条纹帐篷外面，那个穿青一块乌一块衣服的人向甘罗快乐地挥手，王子跨上光溜溜的黑色马背，飞快地奔向来路。他沿着那条弯弯曲曲的道路，跑过那一小束白光，穿过阿塔尼斯的小树林，奔过许多小路，最后冲出了未来森林，奔向父王的城堡，罗拉洛的圣剑在他手中闪闪发光。

在克洛德国王城堡的那个高屋里，公主站在高窗边，瞪大眼睛，一只手按在狂乱的心上，试图祈祷，但因为她记得的只有树木和田野，别的都不记得了，所以她想不出任何祈祷来说。

公主又试图回忆自己的名字，却想不起来。一种郁闷的疑惑悄悄地钻进了她的心里。也许她的确是一个没有名字的流浪者，是一个农夫或厨娘，在挤牛奶或上肉汤的时候不经意地冒犯了某个林间或城堡巫师，被变成了一只鹿。要是这样，说不定就是那个邪恶的男巫心血来潮施了个咒，只有国王的三个儿子热切的追逐才能解开这个魔咒。也许那个巫师曾经大笑着说道：“一位大名鼎鼎的国王的三个儿子会破解你的咒语，自己伤心，也会让你伤心，因为谁会娶一个挤奶女工做新娘呢？”

也许最快回来的王子把战利品放在她的脚边大声说“我需要你交出自己的心和手”的时候，她才会真正醒悟过来。

也许接下来她自己能够，也愿意承认：“我的名字叫某某某，我是个农民。”要么是：“我的名字叫某某某，我是女帮厨。”要是这就是让她受难中魔的可怕结局，她希望是萨格或甘罗，而不是乔恩第一个大声说“我需要你交出自己的心和手”。

不过，尽管心里有这些忧郁的想法，但这个无名少女的眼睛还是低垂，望着乔恩曾经走过的笔直道路。只见一道道阴影横过路面，像黑血一样越流越浓，但路上没有尘土飞扬的痕迹，也没有人或马出现的迹象。公主强迫自己左瞧右看。在甘罗走过的路上，除了树影在风中摇晃之外，什么都纹丝不动，但在萨格走过的路上，公主以为她看到了萨格曾经走过的路上扬起的尘土，几乎大声叫了起来。尘土慢慢地升过树顶，她看到那仅仅是一只天鹅在飞。公主双手捂住眼睛，浑身发抖。





乔恩王子的危险任务


在乔恩王子看来，通向樱桃园的那条路笔直平坦，简直像传奇故事一样不像真的，只是偶尔有一个小小的弯道和微微的颠簸。阳光暖照，风儿轻吹，一只公鸡打鸣，孩子们在远处呼喊，头顶鸟儿歌唱。

一个地方刮来了一阵纸风，纸都被刻成柔美的雪花的形状，梦幻般吹过路面。另一个地方，一条狼抬头嗥叫，乔恩因而看到了这个野兽戴着项圈。

尽管克洛德国王的这个小儿子爱公主，但他一脸忧愁地奔赴使命，因为他相信给他布置的任务不会有与他的力量和勇气不配的危险。

“任何孩子都能摘一千颗樱桃，把它们放入一个银杯，”他大声说道，“任何笨蛋都能打倒人造的貘貘，它是由黏土和檀香木做成，用来吓走小鸟的。我可以面对面对付蓝野猪或杀死可怕的七头龙。让我解一个难解之谜，给我布置一项艰巨的任务，让我打倒一个勇敢的骑士！”

乔恩王子停止抱怨的时候，听到有人在高声尖叫。他环顾四周，却没有看见一个人，而那个声音还在一直尖叫：“乔恩，救救我，救救我，你会有一个难解之谜，会有一项艰巨任务，会有一个勇敢的骑士去打倒。救救我，救救我，乔恩！”

王子左看右看，南看北看，上看下看；而当他抬头看的时候，他看到了她——只见一个女巫被挂在一棵树的最高枝上可怜巴巴地哭着，像一个冒烟的灯笼一样高挂在空中。

乔恩王子下马，爬上树，把女巫从最高枝上抱下来，安全地放在地上。

“我刚才在乘风前进，”她说，“却被挂在了树上，丢失了扫帚，我真倒霉啊！”

乔恩环顾四周，终于明白了女巫的扫帚一定是掉到了一种名叫“巫婆扫帚”的高秆植物丛中，这种植物形态酷似巫婆的扫帚，因而得名。他在扫帚树丛里找了很久，最后绊在女巫的扫帚上，才能物归原主。

“乔恩王子，谢谢你的好意，”女巫骑上扫帚的时候说，“你会有一个难解的谜语来猜，会有一项艰巨的任务去完成，会有一个勇敢的骑士去打倒。”她挥舞着瘦骨嶙峋的长手指飞走了，尖厉的长笑声留在了身后。

乔恩沿着这条笔直平坦的道路继续骑行，直至看到一个斯芬克斯蹲在路边。

“斯芬克斯，给我出一个谜题吧。”乔恩说。

斯芬克斯的那双石眼盯着前方，石爪一动不动，只听它说道：

“什么东西转如旋风？

什么东西卷曲如毛？

告诉我，什么东西珍珠般早早挂起？”

乔恩转眼答复：

“陀螺转如旋风，

发辫卷曲如毛，

露珠珍珠般早早挂起。”

他又骑了一小会儿，然后又原路返回。

“这条谜语难在哪里？”王子问。

“我下巴动不了，说谜语很难。”斯芬克斯说。

乔恩耸了耸肩，继续赶路，突然来到了大樱桃园。他下马，从马鞍上取下银杯，左手握杯，右手持剑，大步流星走进了果园。

貘貘侧着身子左侧着地，躺在樱桃园中央的一片空地上。风吹散了它，雨水冲碎了泥土，虫子蛀了檀香木。貘貘的头在倒地时折断，云雀在凹陷的眼睛里筑巢。一只大鹏鸟昏昏欲睡地栖在这个破碎怪兽的侧腹上，乔恩用剑尖把它赶走了。不远处躺着一位骑士尘迹斑斑的遗骨，身上的盔甲已渐渐生锈。当时貘貘新鲜，骑士看到它可怕的样子，就吓死了。

乔恩看到所有的树上都挂着沉甸甸的鲜红果实，枝条都被压得快挨到了地面。他纳闷樱桃竟然能这样沉甸甸的。他把剑扔在草地里，先用一只手，然后用两只手，设法从果茎上拽下一颗樱桃，放进银杯，却发现那根本不是樱桃，而是一颗樱桃形状的红宝石。所有树上的所有樱桃都是红宝石，无论他用多大劲拽，一颗也掉不下来，也没有一根茎从树枝上脱落。

“你必须数到一千个一千，才能摘一千颗樱桃。”乔恩身后的一个声音说。王子转过身，看到一个头戴尖顶帽的小个子望着他，大大的眼睛闪闪发亮。

“说一、二、三。”那个人说。

“一、二、三。”乔恩说。

“四、五、六。”那个人说。

“四、五、六。”乔恩说。当他迅速数到一千的时候，一颗红宝石掉进了银杯。

“可是，一千个一千是一百万，”乔恩说，“要数到一百万可是一项艰巨的任务！”

“你希望得到一项艰巨任务，现在你有了一项艰巨的任务。”那个人说。

乔恩又数到了一千，又有一颗红宝石掉进了银杯。

“一、二、三、四，我是来摘樱桃，五、六、七、八，我摘到了红宝石，九、十！”乔恩大声说道。

“红宝石、樱桃，樱桃、红宝石，”小个子说，“这是一回事。”

“十一、十二，这怎么是一回事呢？”乔恩问，“十三、十四、十五、十六。”

小个子走来走去，问：“我在做什么？”

“十七、十八、十九、二十，你在走来走去，”乔恩说，“二十一——”

“可是，我不先走过来，又怎么能走过去呢？”

“这是一回事，”乔恩说，“一个人走路，二十二，走来走去，二十三，走去走来，二十四、二十五、二十六、二十七、二十八、二十九、三十。”

“要是走来就是走去，那去就是来，来就是去。”小个子说。

“我不明白这对我完成这项艰巨任务有什么帮助。”乔恩说。他数完第三个一千，第三颗樱桃就掉进了银杯。“这样慢慢腾腾地走，萨格就会带着蓝野猪的金獠牙赶在我前面回家，甘罗就会带着罗拉洛的圣剑赶在我前面回家。我还在数樱桃，让红宝石掉进银杯的时候，他们就会有一个人娶公主。一、二、三、四、五。”

小个子坐在地上望着王子，听他数到了第四个一千，第四颗樱桃掉进了银杯。乔恩又开始从一数起。

“五十年里有五十位王子来到过这个果园，为这个那个公主采摘樱桃或红宝石，”小个子说，“他们没有一个人在数数时运用逻辑。我不是王子，不能像你们那样让樱桃或红宝石落地，我已经让那五十个王子按照他们的方式摘了果子或宝石，为了赢得一位可爱小姐的心、牵住她的手，值得数到一百万。至于你，我的朋友，我们还要考虑这个萨格和这个甘罗。有一个顺理成章的机密能让樱桃坠落。我不能完全告诉你，但我可以问你一些问题。”

“三百四十八、三百四十九、三百五十，”乔恩说，“你要问什么问题？”

“你说九十九的时候，红宝石会落下吗？”

“不会。”

“你说九百九十九的时候，红宝石会落下吗？”

“不会。”

“一颗樱桃或红宝石什么时候会落下？”

“三百五十一，我说一千的时候。”乔恩说。

一颗红宝石掉进了银杯。

“一千！”乔恩又叫道，又一颗红宝石落下。

“一千、一千、一千、一千！”乔恩连连叫道，又有四颗红宝石掉进了杯子。

完全不费时间，确切地说，乔恩花了要一一数到一百万所花时间的千分之一，就让一千颗红宝石落满了杯子。他环顾四周，要感谢头戴尖顶帽的小个子，但哪里也看不见这个人。此时站在乔恩面前的是一个身穿黑盔甲的骑士，这是年轻王子见过的最高大、最强壮的黑骑士。

“给我说一下你的名字，黑骑士！”乔恩叫道。

“我是悲哀末日的黑夫！”闪闪发光的盔甲下面传来了响雷似的声音，除了一双黑眼睛，盔甲把黑骑士遮得严严实实。“我曾经在这些树下跟五十位王子搏斗过，然后我活了下来，跟你讲这个故事！”

乔恩放下银杯，拿起了剑。

“我浑身披钢。难道实力天平不青睐我？”黑骑士低沉地说。

乔恩举起剑。

黑骑士一直把自己的剑放在身侧。“王子，我提醒你，这里有魔法。还有什么比魔法更强大吗？”

“奇迹。”

“什么是奇迹？”黑骑士问。

“爱是足够的奇迹。”

“王子，盔甲是更强大的东西。”黑骑士飞快地举起剑。钢铁跟钢铁碰在一起，叮当作响。黑夫双手握剑挥过头顶，就像一个人抡起一把斧头那样，然后狠狠地劈下，在空中发出了呼呼声，但乔恩飞快地走到一边，瞄准黑骑士盔甲右肩正下方的裂缝猛地刺去。

黑夫差点儿没能及时提剑击开乔恩的剑。黑夫反复挥剑扑刺。乔恩反复横剑挡开，腾挪闪躲。每当黑夫盔甲的缝隙张开时，乔恩就挥剑刺去。有一次，当黑骑士闪电般一剑让乔恩失去平衡的时候，要不是黑骑士绊倒在满盛红宝石的酒杯上，红宝石撒在青草地上，他就会把乔恩的脑袋劈成两半了。战斗在树丛间奔腾盘旋，出出进进，剑声阵阵，剑光闪闪。乔恩的剑尖像明晃晃的蛇一样刺向黑骑士盔甲上的裂缝，随着黑骑士突进退缩突进，裂缝像小嘴似的张合。黑骑士开始越来越重地呼吸，刺得越来越慢，再也不能像战斗刚开始那一小时一样把剑高高地举过头顶，每次都猛刺在乔恩的身体附近。

最后，黑骑士两手把剑举过头顶要劈下去，这会将年轻王子一劈两半，就像劈开一个苹果那样。乔恩的剑像光一样快，刺向黑骑士右肩下的裂缝，剑尖深深扎入。黑骑士的武器掉在地上，右臂像钟摆一样，在侧面无用地晃动。

黑色钢甲的巨大身影摇摇晃晃，铿锵作响，倒在草地上。那顶把黑骑士遮得只露一双黑眼睛的头盔猛地扭脱，滚来滚去，叮当一声停靠在银杯上面。让乔恩王子大为惊骇的是，他看到了一个七十岁男人的头和脸。乔恩悲伤而遗憾地跪在倒下的敌人身边，把骑士的头抱在怀里。

“我要是知道你是一位如此值得尊敬的骑士，就不会跟你搏斗了。”乔恩说。

“你搏斗得好像我代表的是可怕东西，那是对勇气的考验和证明，这就是证明和考验。当屋里一片漆黑的时候，谁知道哪是怪物，哪是老鼠？”黑骑士的声音不再雷鸣，而是细小微弱。

乔恩扶老人站起来，为他止血、包扎伤口，大声问道：“我能相信什么？还有什么能相信呢？”

“啊，相信你的心，”老人说，“相信爱。五十年前，为了博得一位小姐的爱，我承担了一项艰巨的任务。我披上傲慢自大的盔甲，试图面对面对抗可怕的貘貘，却遇到了这个木制泥塑的无害东西。‘爱情就是心血来潮！’我嚷道，‘人类就是愚蠢！’……王子，可怕的怪物并不危险，完成这项任务也不是伟大壮举，一切都在于保住一个人赢得的心。每年五月，我曾经背弃的爱情，一定会把我打倒，年复一年，直到我死去，这就是一个没有骑马回家娶自己爱人的男人的悲哀末日。”

乔恩沉默了一小会儿，然后说道：“后来，你的一个兄弟就带着金獠牙或一把银剑回家，娶了那位小姐吗？”

老人在盔甲中瑟瑟发抖。

“她从来没有嫁人，而是白天跟猫头鹰坐在一起，晚上跟猫坐在一起，一边四处张望，一边大声喊道：‘听着！’她的真爱以各种形式出现，是尘埃，是风，是玫瑰。她的声音变得又高又尖，越来越疯狂。最后，她用耗子、菘蓝、鸡蛇和芸香酿成了一种毒液，并对毒液施了一道隐喻的咒语。我穿的盔甲是力量，盔甲里的弱点是傲慢。无论我如何声如雷鸣，内心从不安全。”老骑士眨着眼，挤掉一滴泪。“人们每年五月看见她一次，像树上冒烟的灯笼一样晃来晃去……王子，快骑吧，爱与你同行。”

年轻王子默默地望着老骑士，听他说完。乔恩所能说的就是：“她称你是勇士，在你的盔甲里设置的裂缝不是太靠近心脏。”

当悲哀末日的黑夫慢慢地走开，身影消失在树林间的时候，盔甲叮当作响传来了深沉的悲鸣。

乔恩王子匆匆把散落的红宝石重新装满杯子，过了一会儿便骑马飞驰向父王的城堡，银杯在他的手里闪闪发亮。





邪恶魔法


四个指节在城堡里那间高屋的门上叩了七下。当公主吩咐客人进来后，克洛德国王大步走进来，身后跟着托克、皇家史官和御医。

“我们有三件痛苦的事儿要说——一个是事实，一个是故事，还有一个是结论。”克洛德开口说道，大脸发红。

“陛下，要是我可以先说的话，”公主说，“我有一件痛苦的疑惑要说。”

“那就说说你的疑惑，”克洛德说，“只要它不涉及我和我的儿子们的荣誉。”

托克啧啧连声，紧紧地盯着公主。

“不要对我啧啧，”克洛德说，“我今天没有心情啧啧。”

他挥了挥手，公主继续说了起来：“我怀疑我记不起自己的名字，可能是我没有名字可说。可能我是一个挤奶工或帮厨。”

“啧啧，”托克说，“我母亲是一个村姑，过去经常唱：

“‘当所有公主都逝去，

村姑们还是会继续。’”

“我没有轻视任何女人，”公主说，“只要她承认她是谁，是干什么的。按照一些规则、法令和命令，身份卑微或一般血统的女子不能嫁给乔恩。”

“也不能嫁给萨格。”克洛德说。

“也不能嫁给甘罗。”皇家史官说。

“我父亲过去经常哼一首曲子，一部分是这样唱的，”托克说。

“‘国王和王子，

笨蛋和傻瓜——’”

“你要是不闭嘴，就在地牢里唱完你的歌吧！”克洛德国王嚷道。他走到公主的身边，只见公主在又一次目光焦虑地扫视着那三条道路。

“尽管我私下知道一些情况，但我可以发誓，几乎可以发誓，你是有皇家血统的公主。”他转身对其他人说：“注意她说话的方式和头部的动作。”

“然后注意她纤细的脚踝和小脚。”皇家史官说。

“还有她高高的额头和明亮的眼睛。”托克说。

“你们被幻觉蒙蔽了！”御医嚷道，他一直在静静地为自己把脉，但没有数数，因为作为病人，他还是认为自己在生病；而作为医生，他又认为自己健康。“正是这种让人糊涂的巫术。我告诉你们，任何东西在扰乱医术方面都不及巫术的一半。我想起我有过一个病人，他是一个巫师，能让一个肿瘤在全身跳舞，甚至让它呈现出一朵花、一颗宝石的外观。让我们别为虚假的形状和外表蛊惑。现在是什么，过去就是什么——过去是什么，将来也是什么。我要测一下这个动物的心脏。”

“这位小姐的心脏。”克洛德纠正。

“在有证据之前，我们都会凭外观判断。”

“我答应她一个事实、一个故事和一个结论。”克洛德说。

“我来讲故事。”托克说。

“我来下结论。”御医说。

“我来陈述事实。”皇家史官说。“那么，事实就是，”他对公主说，“你不记得自己的名字。”

“托克来讲故事吧。”克洛德说。

“实际上，”皇家史官说，“就事实和数目来说，有不止一个故事要讲。托克有托克的故事，另外还有九个故事，全都完全相同，都有相似之处。”

“既然它们都一样，那我们就坚持讲一个。”克洛德说。

“我只想陈述、宣称、肯定、声明、主张、坦白、宣告、断言、宣布、允诺并表示总共正好有十个这种故事，每个故事都完全一样，相互证实、印证和证明。”

“别咬文嚼字了！”克洛德叫道，“托克，讲故事吧！”

于是，托克讲起了一百年前那只白鹿的故事，说它如何实际上是一只鹿，而不是有皇家血统的公主。

公主站在那里，一动不动，默默地听着。

“御医来下结论。”克洛德国王命令。

御医一直在角落里对自己啊个不停，轻叩自己的胸部，数到了九，这时跨步向前。

“得出的结论，”他手指尖并在一起说，“得出的结论，事实上，毫无疑问，没有疑惑的是——但要等一下，我还没有测试你的心脏。”他把右耳贴在公主的胸上倾听，又是喃喃地说着“呣”“嗬”“呣”。

“心脏太高了，太高了，”他最后宣布说，“位置高，心率也高。有一次跳跃，一次明显的跳跃，可能就像以前太多次跃过小溪，太多次跃过小溪引起的反应一样，但在考察那些小溪之前，我还不能下最后的结论。”

国王沉下脸来，移开目光，命令道：“下结论。”

“啊，是的，结论，”御医说，“结论是，从人类的所有可能性来看——或者应该说从动物的所有可能性来看？——不过，当然情况并不完全是这样，亲爱的小姐——应该说亲爱的动物——你是一只鹿……说‘啊’。”御医自言自语地补充道，他一边“啊”，一边退回一个角落。

克洛德国王盯着冰冷的石地，脸还是通红；皇家史官乱摸起了口袋里的印章和绶带；托克再也看不清月亮星星的昏花老眼充满了温柔同情的神色。

公主一动不动，只是稍微抬高了脑袋。

“要是你还想不起自己的名字，那你就一定是一只鹿。”国王说。

“公主一定会记得自己的名字。”皇家史官说。

“尤其考虑到没有证据表明你患过严重到足以根除记忆的脑震荡，也没有眼睛瞳孔的明显伸缩，表示你服过药水、媚药或其他消除剂，”御医说，“消除剂，”他皱着眉重复道，“有这个词吗？”

“你也许是想说铲除剂。”皇家史官说，“我想，铲除剂是一个词，尽管你重复说的时候，的确听上去没有意义。”

“别再这样字斟句酌、咬文嚼字了！”克洛德嚷道，“解释一下咒语的特性、她中魔的规则吧。”

皇家史官清了清嗓子，说了起来。

“在这种魔法中——我认为这魔法品位差极了——由于显而易见的原因，那只呈现公主面貌和外形的真鹿发现，一旦她不幸的秘密被揭穿，她就不可能保留骑士、王子或农夫的爱。”

“继续说，继续说。”国王命令道。

“‘爱毫无疑问会舍弃你三次，这样你的咒语就会奏效，’”皇家史官神情严肃地说，“‘当爱舍弃了你三次，你就会恢复一只鹿的原形。’”

“注意，不要再跃过小溪。对心脏不好。”御医说，“咪、咪、咪、咪。”他一边检查喉咙疼不疼，一边补充道。

“唉，倒霉啊，不幸的母鹿！”皇家史官喊道。

“住嘴，你这无礼的文书！”克洛德说，“这位小姐现在还是一位公主，只要她还是两条腿，而不是四条腿站立，就应该这样叫她。”

公主终于开口说话了，乌黑的眼睛清澈无畏。“在我的王子要求我把心和手交给他之前，我请求告诉他这个悲伤的故事。”她说。

“既然请求，那就批准，说定了！”克洛德躬了躬身，“说话的口气倒像公主。”

皇家史官又清了清嗓子。“要是偶然发生、偶然遇到、突然出现、举行或实现，这个、那个或另一个王子不管发生过什么、真实情况如何、应该如何、不管为什么，他依然保持对你的爱，那你就会永远保持一位公主的外形。古老的咒语就是这样说的，古老的魔法就是这样做的。”

托克跨步向前，举起一只手。“克洛德，我求你记住，你儿子们的母亲曾拥有过一只鹿的外形，而她实际上是一位具有皇家血统的公主。”

“可是，该死的，她记得自己的名字！”克洛德嚷道，“这只漂亮的鹿——”

“按你自己的法令，是这位公主。”皇家史官说。

“那么，这位公主——”克洛德又开始脸色发红，转过了脸。

“现在的我就是将来的我，”公主说，“将来的我就是现在的我。”

“为了鼓舞你，我就这样说，”克洛德说，“你曾是考验人们的力量和技巧的跑得最快的鹿。就像托克父亲故事里的鹿一样，普通呆子不会追你的。无论是站还是跑，你都配得上国王和王子。”

房间已经黑影密布；在国王盛赞公主后的片刻寂静中，远处传来了杂乱的马蹄声。国王大步走到窗边，向外看。

“这是什么魔法？”他喊道，“看哪！三份战利品一起闪耀！王子们三位一体策马而来！他们的路径交叉相连，寸秒交会。这里有奇迹，也有巫术。”

托克、皇家史官和御医越过克洛德国王的巨肩凝视，只见萨格、甘罗和乔恩正向城堡大门飞驰而来，战利品在他们的手里闪耀，三匹马鼻尖贴鼻尖，就像辔着一副马具。

公主背靠光线渐暗的窗口站立，闭上眼睛，感觉一只手握住了她的手，她听见侏儒孔多低沉的声音说道：“来吧。”他领她离开房间，沿着弯弯曲曲的石阶，进入大圆厅，扶她坐进高脚雕花金椅，自己蹲在她右侧的地上。

气喘吁吁的国王和气喘吁吁的臣子从一扇门冲进来，气喘吁吁的王子们从另一扇门也冲进来，圆厅里响起了他们奔跑的脚步声。

还没等坐在金椅里的公主越过杂沓的脚步声和喊叫声，把她中魔的悲伤故事告诉他们，王子们就在同一时刻把战利品放在了她的脚边——萨格放的是大蓝野猪的金獠牙，甘罗放的是罗拉洛的圣剑，乔恩放的是装满红宝石的银杯——他们异口同声地大声说道：“我要得到你的心和手！”

最后出现了一片令人呼吸沉重的沉默，谁也没有动。王子们各自单膝跪下，目光望着公主。国王和臣子们像冻僵似的站在那里，孔多蹲着一动不动。

公主站起来，挺直身体，举止优雅，无所畏惧，用低沉可爱的声音对国王说道：“我不知道按什么顺序进行。三位王子一起跪下。三份战利品一起闪耀。”

国王沉下脸来，转向皇家史官，命令道：“宣布顺序。”

“至少在我这一辈子，没有人见过这种奇迹。”皇家史官说。

“还有我这一辈子和我父亲那一辈子。”老托克说。

“但应该说，要是你愿意这样下令——”皇家史官对国王说。

“下令！”克洛德大声说道，“下令，接受你的意见。”

“那就让大儿子先说，依次类推。”

“我什么也看不见。”托克说。

“点亮火把！”国王喊道。于是，城堡走廊里回响起了这道命令：“点亮火把！点亮火把！点亮火把！”

十二个黄衣小人在圆厅里闪来闪去，很快火焰就在环形墙壁上燃烧起来。公主开口说话，悲伤的眼睛看着萨格。

“你要求得到一个人的心和手，事实上她是一只鹿，因为女巫或男巫的心血来潮，这只鹿变成了一个女人的外形。”

当墙上的火把在盾牌和长矛之间闪光摇曳的时候，公主又开口说道：

“根据人们铭记的古老咒语和古老传说，根据各种迹象，三位王子要求得到一个人的心和手，实际上是一只鹿。我知道，你们经历过那些危险、那些孤旅、那些风霜雪雨，才把战利品放在我这个无名者的脚边。真心爱我，永不舍弃我——我就会永远是女人；但要是爱舍弃我三次，我就会转眼消失。故事就是如此，咒语就是如此。萨格王子，你会好好爱我吗？”

克洛德的大儿子站起来，一声不吭，折断手里的大蓝野猪的金獠牙，转过了身。

“爱已经舍弃过她一次。”托克悲叹道。

“真心爱我，永不舍弃我——我就会永远是女人；但要是爱舍弃我三次，我就会转眼消失。故事就是如此，咒语就是如此。甘罗王子，你会好好爱我吗？”

甘罗王子站起来，一声不吭，在膝盖上掰断了罗拉洛的圣剑，转过身一走了之。

“爱已经舍弃过她两次。”皇家史官低声说道。

“真心爱我，永不舍弃我——我就会永远是女人；但要是爱舍弃我三次，我就会转眼消失。就这样讲故事，就这样传咒语。乔恩王子，你会好好爱我吗？”

“爱将舍弃她三次。”御医声音沙哑地说。

乔恩王子站起来，举起装满红宝石的银杯。

“敞开大门！”克洛德国王吼道，“让白鹿过去！谁伸手拿长矛，谁就会死得像猪一样！敞开大门！让白鹿过去！”城堡走廊里回响起了这道命令：“敞开大门！……敞开大门！……敞开大门！……”

站在金椅前的白色身影一动不动。当乔恩王子举起银杯的时候，所有人都瞪大眼睛、伸长脖子。

“能听见一枚花瓣坠落。”皇家史官低声说道。

“我什么也听不见。”托克说。

“安静！”国王吼道，“给她让路！乔恩心里说不，大家都听到了她的末日！”

乔恩王子说：“曾经的你是什么样子，现在的你并不是；现在的你是什么样子，你将永远是什么样子。我把这份战利品放在爱的手里。”

公主两手接住银杯。

“你会拥有我的心。”乔恩说。

在年轻王子说话的时候，火把变得像宁静的烛光一样暗淡，四月的芬芳充满了房间，乔恩看到了一位新公主，比他在生活中或睡梦中见到的更可爱。

“要是我没记错的话，这是紫丁香的芬芳。”老托克说。

“嘘。”御医说。

“这个王子是谁，这个从这位小姐手里接过银杯的身材高大的陌生王子是谁？”皇家史官低声问道。

的确有一个陌生人转眼间莫名其妙地冒出来，是一个身材高大、皮肤黝黑、年纪轻轻的陌生人，只见他站在可爱的少女身边，手里握着她的银杯，以便她可以从金椅边向下走几步，把手放在乔恩的手里。

克洛德国王像别人一样同时看到了陌生王子，闭上眼睛，用指关节揉了揉，又睁开，向前走了一步。

“你的名字、你的王国，还有你的来由！”克洛德吼道。

高个王子向国王鞠了一躬，说道：“在说出我的名字、我的王国和我的来由之前，我求陛下开恩。”

“说说我如何开恩。”国王说。

“一件早想做却没有做的事儿。”王子把银杯放在金椅上面。

皇家史官清了清嗓子，说道：“应该说出是什么恩惠，加以描述，详细说明；应该把它适当写进书卷、签名和盖章。”

“胡说！”国王说，“我喜欢这个年轻人的目光。恩准。”

听到这话，无名王子大步走向萨格和甘罗站立的地方，一只手臂抓起一个，让他们的头连撞了七次，才把他们放下来。

国王响亮的笑声震得墙上的铁盾嗡嗡作响。“这是什么神灵，把人当木偶一样玩耍？”克洛德大声问道。

年轻王子躬了躬身。

“陛下，我的名字叫泰尔，我是强大的北国国王托尔格的小儿子。”

“一位富有强大的君主，大家都说他是一个出色的掌舵人。”国王说。他挥手让年轻人继续说。

“你知道我的王国和我的名字，现在说说我的来由。陛下，我可以向你，向你的儿子们和大臣们介绍我的小妹妹吗？她是一位高贵国王的高贵女儿，也是勇敢的乔恩王子的未婚妻。”泰尔王子向皮肤黝黑的可爱小姐深鞠一躬，她的手还在紧紧地握着乔恩的手，“来自北国的罗莎诺尔公主殿下。”

克洛德和他的人被一种新魔法控制住了，惊讶了好一阵子，没有人走动，也没有人说话。克洛德的脸像一面五颜六色的旗帜，最后才恢复了他平常喝酒时的脸色。

“里拉琴和小提琴！”克洛德吼道，“有肉有酒！我再想一下，这种场合适合什么酒？融化一百万颗红宝石！不过，等一下！我再想一下，还是喝瓶葡萄酒吧！这个魔法已经改变了我的心情，但改变不了我的胃口。泰尔王子和罗莎诺尔公主，我向你们表示热烈欢迎，祝你们健康快乐。”

“这种情况缺乏先例，即使真的不可能，也很难分类、整理和记载。我们这里有两套明显无关又部分重叠的咒语。从法律意义来说，我从心里谴责重叠现象。”他继续喋喋不休，但没有人听。

在里拉琴和小提琴演奏的时候，人们跑来跑去，笑声不断，相互寒暄和恭维。御用巫师制造了一阵银色星星雨，宴会厅里的一张大桌摆满了肉、鲜花和葡萄酒。泰尔王子坐在国王身边的桌首，他们的右侧坐着罗莎诺尔，他们的左侧坐着乔恩。国王重重地捶了桌子一拳，震得水晶器皿都跳了起来。

“我是从她说话的方式和头部的动作认出她的。”国王说。

“我是从她的小脚和纤细的脚踝认出她的。”皇家史官说。

“我是从她高高的额头和明亮的眼睛认出她的。”托克说。

“我是通过在心里歌唱认出她的。”乔恩说。

萨格与甘罗怒视着他们的盘子。

“你是笨蛋。”萨格说。

“你是傻瓜。”甘罗说。

克洛德环顾周围，盯着盾牌下面的暗处，对泰尔说：“那里有一个愚蠢的侏儒，夜里像猫一样蹑手蹑脚走来走去。”

“像一群猫，还是像一只猫？”

“像一群猫，”克洛德说，“他好像同时坐在六七个角落。”

“他在你的身边很久了吗？”泰尔问。

“三个月左右。”克洛德说。他将一大杯酒一饮而尽。“有一天，他突然出现，我就让他留下了。是一个看管马匹和猎犬的好手。更重要的是，事实证明，比我更会识人，我因此欠了这个卑微的小丑一桶宝石。从来没有这样愿赌服输过呢。我对这个侏儒有一种傻傻的喜爱之情。不过，不能说我流露过这种感情。我希望没有厄运降临到他的头上。”克洛德又端起一大杯酒，举到嘴边喝，然后闭上了眼睛。

“陛下，孔多永远消失了。”泰尔用一种熟悉的低沉声音说，国王对这种声音记忆深刻。

大酒杯叮当掉在了地上，克洛德一跃而起，闭上眼睛，又睁开了一只，盯着泰尔。

“你是孔多！”国王嚷道。

“我过去是。”泰尔说。

国王又喝干了一碗酒，才再次开口说话：“我喜欢这酒的味道，感觉就像皮革一样。无论什么情况，无论是骑马还是喝酒，我都要跟你的父亲一比高低。阁下，我是猎人，是马上好手。啊，是的，”他的眼睛炯炯有神，“无论什么情况，我对奇迹都没有心情，我的朋友。我要是王中王的话，就要终止魔法。泰尔，我不大优雅，毫无疑问是因为我没有女儿，要是我冒犯了你，我就低声下气求你原谅。巫术是一种比酒更令人伤心的东西，它搞混了比我更强的脑子。”他又一次从碗里深深地喝了一口。“一只鹿现在是罗莎诺尔，侏儒是泰尔，是什么韵律或暗号打破了这个咒语？这个邪恶的魔法可以让国王的儿子变成什么呢？”

他重重地捶了一下桌子，要求肃静。

“魔法痛苦，魔法甜蜜。”克洛德开口说道。他搜肠刮肚想一首曲子，却想不起来。“已经把伟大的克洛德家族和托尔格家族连了起来。”他喝了一口大碗里的酒。“在托尔格有生以来最好的日子里，我要骑马胜过他、喝酒胜过他，尽管这跟当前的话题无关。我们今天已经见证了一个需要解释的奇迹。我向你们介绍一下年轻王子泰尔，”他坐下来，又努力站起，“泰尔。”他威严地说，然后又坐回椅子上。

所有的目光都盯着年轻高大的王子，除了萨格和甘罗的眼睛，他们正在互相咕哝。

“酒已经让你糊涂了。”萨格说。

“我告诉你，那条龙必须得上足发条，”甘罗说，“用一把大钥匙。”

“肃静！”国王吼道。于是，年轻的泰尔王子站起来，开始讲起了他自己和妹妹中魔的故事。

“陛下，我的父亲、伟大的北国国王托尔格年轻的时候，受到过许多少女的爱慕，”王子开口说道，“他的战功和追猎打开了五十个少女柔软的心锁。”

“噗！”克洛德说，“接着讲。”

“有一个名叫娜歌洛姆·亚夫的邪恶嫉妒的少女，她在我父亲跟他选定的公主结婚那天发毒誓要报复他的全家。

“一年零二十天前，我和罗莎诺尔公主正在格温荒原骑行。太阳落下，大风刮起，我们就迷了路。一轮弯月升起；借着月光，我们看到一只动物躺在草丛里，好像是一只死去或睡着的秃鹰。还没等我下马，它好像就飞了起来，在我们的眼前盘旋，在空中画出了可怕的符号和标志。原来这是娜歌洛姆·亚夫暗地雇佣的巫婆，她施展了可怕的魔法。一时间，我们像石人坐在石马上一样。

“罗莎诺尔被变成了一只鹿，只有在一位国王和他的三个儿子把这只鹿逼到绝境时，魔法才能解除，但即使到了那个时候，她也不知道、说不出自己的姓名。不过，在她听到一位王子表明对她的爱，不在乎疑惑、恐惧和谣言的那一天那一刻，咒语会像水晶碰在石头上一样碎裂，而她又会变成罗莎诺尔公主。”

克洛德国王咬着胡子，问道：“要是我们这位年轻的乔恩王子没有表明他的爱，那会怎样呢？”

“要是爱舍弃了我的妹妹三次，”泰尔说，“她就会一辈子没有名字，到处流浪。”

“这些咒语，”皇家史官说，“杂乱无章，令人震惊。这些咒语都应该写下来，得到见证，加以证实。在我们法律的所有假定中，最有力的假定是这样：Scribendum est，也就是说，要是书卷不存在，书卷就会不存在。要是书卷不存在，这些咒语就会无效、可违背、行不通、不可靠，只有轻信的人才会容忍。现在这两条咒语，即——A和B咒语，分别涉及罗莎诺尔和泰尔，以下称为一和二，要么应该彻底改动，要么应该完全忽略，因为在法律事实中它们从来不存在，法律事实主张，要是一件不该存在的东西总是存在，那它就从来没有存在过。法律事实比世俗或一般事实要灵活得多，更有益，后者主张，正因为一件事总是存在，所以它曾存在过。”

“潦潦草草乱写乱画！”克洛德说。

“我自己中魔，”泰尔继续说道，“则是另一回事。我被变成了一个具有一切记忆的侏儒。我知道我和罗莎诺尔的名字，但无论是用朴素的语言还是迂回的语言，我都没有能力向她或任何其他人说出我们的名字，也讲不出我们的故事。不过，在我听到一位王子表明对罗莎诺尔的爱，不在乎疑惑、恐惧和谣言的那一天那一刻，我就又变成了泰尔王子。要是爱舍弃了公主三次，我就会一辈子被称为矮胖的侏儒孔多。”

“你是怎么来到这里的？”克洛德问道，“你的妹妹又是怎么来到我们不幸的森林的呢？”

“在我们绝望的那年，她逃过了二十个王国，”泰尔说，“孔多总是跟在她后面一百里格远的地方。吟游歌手、骑士和旅行者都会指出全世界跑得最快的那只鹿走的那条路，我就会漫步前进。我在雪季里跟丢了她，因为人们给我讲了你们魔法森林的故事，就漫游到了这里。魔法森林会吸引中魔的东西。我满怀希望。陛下，就像巫术里规定的那样，你是国王，有三个儿子。为了生计，我给你喂养猎犬和马匹，每天夜里轻轻地从房间的窗户下到地上，前往魔法森林。她终于来了。我看到她像月光穿过萤火虫和雪地一样闪亮。我曾在森林里遇见过一位巫师，就是强势的巫师罗。我对他说不出我或罗莎诺尔的名字，也讲不出我们的故事，但巫师们有办法知道情况。一天夜里，他扮成吟游歌手来到这里，给你唱了有关一只鹿的歌，那是一只像光一样快的鹿——”

“我想我认识那个泼皮无赖的脸，”克洛德吼道，“我当时就这么说！”

高个子王子微微一笑，继续讲起了故事。

“巫师通过这样那样的花招玩时间游戏。我想他是让萨格和甘罗拖延，我想他是让乔恩一路追赶。巫师的魔法让王子们骑马回家，不是各自，而是一起到达。”

“他一定是树上的那个圆胖子。”萨格说。

“他一定是那个蓝衣人。”甘罗说。

“他一定是那个告诉我樱桃为什么坠落的小个子。”乔恩说。

“我就知道他们是通过巫术骑马，我当时就这么说过！”克洛德嚷道。

“我不记得你说过。”皇家史官说。

“我也不记得。”托克说。

“我也不记得。”御医说，他正在狠狠地击打桌下自己的膝盖，测试自己的条件反射。

“我记得，”罗莎诺尔说，“‘这里有魔法和巫术！’他喊道。我听得一清二楚。”

“她既可爱又聪明！”克洛德嚷道。“我被这些老态龙钟和笨蛋团团围住，可以说，是在荒原里吹号。”他端起放在面前的一碗刚刚满上的葡萄酒。

“我自己和罗莎诺尔中魔的故事就这样讲完了，”泰尔说，“剩余的，你都知道了。”他对国王鞠了一躬，就坐下了。

“我在荒原里吹号。”克洛德重复道；因为他好像要哭，所以里拉琴和小提琴弹奏起了一首活泼的曲子。

克洛德国王站起来，举起酒杯。“为欢喜与欢乐干杯。”他对罗莎诺尔和泰尔说，然后对罗莎诺尔和乔恩说：“为强大的国王托尔格，为当代第二大猎人干杯，大家都干杯！”

里拉琴和小提琴欢快演奏，御用巫师变出了一群白鸽和一串红玫瑰。

见到鸽子和玫瑰，御医总是打喷嚏，就站起来，一边鞠躬，一边打喷嚏，退出了房间。在宴会厅外面的走廊里，他绊在一条趴着做梦的垂耳大狗的身上，仰面摔倒。他一瘸一拐，一边打喷嚏，一边抗议，走回了自己的房间。

巫师在里拉琴和小提琴的上方变出了一股银泉和一阵金雨。

老托克望着乔恩和罗莎诺尔跳舞，罗莎诺尔和泰尔跳舞，就站起来，吟诵了一段日晷铭文：

“爱恒久，时光慢转：

玫瑰、白鸽和喷泉。”

皇家史官比平常喝的酒多，对自己背诵起了永久管业法和衡平法。

越过音乐和笑声，克洛德国王继续侃侃而谈：“嗨嗬唱吧，喝吧跳吧，但不要太久，也不要太晚。明天太阳高高升起的时候，我们就骑马去北国。”他念出这个国名的时候，面部肌肉抽搐了一下，闭上眼睛，又睁开了一只，“我仍然坚持认为，我宁死不愿喝那种北方酒。它像海龟的眼泪一样阴冷，像巫婆的咒语一样不快。我敢说，这东西只适用于擦拭带扣和铃铛上的铁锈。”他把一碗克洛德特白高举过头顶。“上帝保佑我们大家！”他大声说着，一饮而尽，然后穿过笑声和音乐，穿过银泉和金雨，穿过玫瑰和白鸽，上床睡觉去了。

第二天，要是太阳能够得着托克的日晷，当它落到正午的刻度上的时候，国王、他的儿子们、罗莎诺尔和泰尔披盔戴甲，马饰叮当作响，向北国出发了。一百头骡子驮着两百桶红酒、白酒和黄酒，走在最后面。





尾声


古时候有一册落满灰尘的泛黄书卷。这本书讲道，在乔恩王子对罗莎诺尔说“你拥有我的心”的那一天那一刻，嫉妒邪恶的少女娜歌洛姆·亚夫和她雇佣的巫婆被晴空的一道闪电劈开、枯萎，就像被一种奇怪的强效消除剂从世界上完全清除了。

我没有任何理由怀疑这本书，因为它签过名、盖过章，得到了见证和检验。

十三座钟


1


从前，一座人迹罕至的小山上有一座阴森森的城堡，那里有十三座不会走动的钟，那里住着冷酷、好斗的公爵和他的侄女萨拉琳达公主。无论刮风下雨，萨拉琳达都是暖融融的，但公爵总是冷冰冰的。他的双手像他的笑容一样冰冷，简直像他的心一样冰冷。他睡觉的时候戴着手套，他醒着的时候也戴着手套，这使他难以捡起别针、硬币或坚果仁，也难以拽下夜莺的翅膀。他身高六英尺四英寸，四十六岁，甚至比他自己认为的更冰冷。一只眼睛戴着天鹅绒眼罩；另一只眼睛透过单片眼镜闪闪发光，这使他的半边身子显得比另一半离你更近。他十二岁那年失去了一只眼睛，因为他喜爱窥视鸟巢和兽窝，寻找鸟兽，加以伤害。一天下午，一只母伯劳鸟先啄伤了他。他的夜晚都是在噩梦中度过，白天则喜欢琢磨恶毒的计划。

公爵诡计多端，常常会一瘸一拐地咯咯笑着穿过城堡冰冷的走廊，筹划着一些不可能完成的壮举，让向萨拉琳达求婚之人去做。他不希望她出嫁，因为她的手是城堡里唯一温暖的手。就连他的手表和所有十三座钟的指针也都冻僵了。它们在七年前一个雪夜的同一时间都冻僵了；之后，城堡里的时间总是四点五十分。旅行者和水手们常常仰望荒凉小山上那座阴森森的城堡，说道：“那里的时间冻僵了。总是当初那个时间。绝不是现在这个时间。”

冷酷的公爵害怕现在这个时间，因为现在这个时间既有热情又有紧迫感，而当初那个时间却已消亡并被埋葬。现在这个时间说不定会有某位喜气洋洋的英勇骑士赶来——“可是，不！”冷酷的公爵咕哝道。“王子要亲自去做一项可怕的新工作：去一个高不可攀的地方，去找一件遥不可及的东西，去举一副难以承担的担子。”公爵害怕此时，但他却要摆弄那些钟表，看它们会不会走，出于奇特的反常心理，祈祷它们不会走。各种修补匠设法用工具启动钟表，几个碰巧路过的巫师设法用咒语启动钟表，又是摇，又是骂，但钟表既不嗡嗡转，也不嘀嗒响。那些钟表死了；公爵整天想着这事情，最后认定是他谋杀了时间，用剑杀死了时间，把血淋淋的剑刃在它的胡子上擦了擦，留它躺在那里，发条松散，钟摆也散了。

公爵之所以一瘸一拐，是因为他的两条腿长短不一，右腿比左腿长，因为他年轻的时候上午都用来定位踢小猫小狗了。他常常会问求婚者：“我的两条腿的长度有什么区别？”要是年轻人回答说：“啊，一条腿比另一条腿短，”公爵就会从随身携带的剑鞘里抽出剑，一剑把他刺穿，丢去喂鹅。求婚者应该说：“啊，一条腿比另一条腿长。”许多王子因说错腿的长短而被刺死。其他王子也同样因一些微不足道的冒犯而被杀——要么是踩踏公爵的茶花，要么是没有称赞他的葡萄酒，要么是凝视他的手套太久，要么是注视他的侄女太久。那些从他的奚落和宝剑下挺过去的求婚者，要完成难以置信的任务，以牵上他侄女的手，那是在时间被冻死在一个雪夜的四点五十分的城堡里唯一温暖的手。公爵吩咐他们去切下一片月亮，或者把海水变成葡萄酒，吩咐他们去寻找一些从来没有的东西，去建造不可能存在的东西。他们来到这里，尝试，失败，消失，再也没有回来。像我说过的那样，有些人被杀害，要么是因为使用了X开头的名字，要么是因为掉了勺子，要么是因为戴了戒指，要么是因为对罪恶说了失敬的话。

城堡和公爵变得越来越冷，萨拉琳达像公主那样，即使是在时间冻僵的地方，年龄也会变大一点，但只是大一点儿。她快二十一岁那年的一天，一个假扮成吟游歌手的王子唱着歌来到了位于城堡下面的城镇。他自称兴谷（Xingu），这不是他的名字，而且这很危险，因为这个名字是以X开头——现在还是。他完完全全是一个穿得破破烂烂的人儿，是一个破衣烂衫的吟游歌手，为了点小钱和爱好而唱歌。然而，兴谷——他如此轻率地自称——是一位有实力的国王的儿子，但他已经渐渐地厌倦了锦衣玉食、竞技比赛和在自己王国所能找到的公主们，渴望去远方寻找梦中的少女，一边走一边唱，了解底层的生活，说不定去这里那里杀死一条龙。

在城堡下面的镇子里，银天鹅酒馆的招牌处聚集着酒店老板、旅行者、说书人、酒鬼、混混和其他镇民。他就是在那里听说了萨拉琳达——这茫茫大海中上千座岛上最可爱的公主。“要是你能把雨水变成银子，她就是你的。”一位酒店老板乜斜着眼说。

“要是你能杀死猪毛岭的刺毛野猪，她就是你的。”一名旅行者咧嘴笑道，“但根本没有什么猪毛岭的刺毛野猪，所以这就很难成功。”

“使这件事难上加难的是她叔叔的奚落和宝剑。”一个说书人冷笑道，“他会把你从上到下一劈两半。”

“公爵身高七英尺九英寸，只有二十八岁，劲头正足呢。”一个醉鬼咯咯笑道，“他的手冷得足以停摆钟表，壮得足以扼死牛，快得足以抓住风。他会捏碎吟游歌手们，就像咸饼干放进汤里一样。”

“我们的这个吟游歌手将会用歌声温暖老人的心，用宝石和金子让他眼花缭乱。”一个混混皮笑肉不笑地说，“他会践踏公爵的山茶花，弄洒他的葡萄酒，弄钝他的宝剑，还会说出他的X开头的名字，最后公爵会说：‘带走萨拉琳达，也带走我的祝福。噢，尊贵的破衣王子！噢，太阳的骑手！’”

这个混混体重十八英石(1)，但吟游歌手一把将他拎起来，抛向了空中，然后又接住了他，把他放了下来。随后，歌手付账，离开了银天鹅酒馆。

“我曾经见过那个年轻人。”旅行者盯着兴谷的背影沉思道，“不过，他当时既不是破衣烂裤，也不是吟游歌手。现在让我想想，是在哪里见过他？”

“是在公爵的汤里，”醉鬼说，“就像咸饼干一样。”

酒馆外面，一轮摇曳的黄月照亮了夜晚，月角上举着一颗白星。小山上那座阴森森的城堡里有一盏提灯明明灭灭，来来去去，好像憔悴的公爵从一个房间潜入另一个房间，刺杀蝙蝠、蜘蛛和老鼠。“用宝石让公爵眼花缭乱。”吟游歌手大声说道，“这其中有玄机，但我想不起来是什么，也想不起来是在哪里。”他不知道公爵会不会命令他去降一场紫雪、用锯木屑做一张桌子，或者只是把他从上到下一劈两半，然后对萨拉琳达说道：“你那个最新来的傻瓜，一个默默无闻的吟游歌手，他就躺在那里。我要吩咐侍从们拿他去喂鹅。”吟游歌手在月光下瑟瑟发抖，不知道哪里是上、哪里是下，也不知道他何时、何由、如何能侵入城堡。从来没有听说过一位公爵会请一个破衣烂裤的吟游歌手就餐、派他做什么或让他会见公主。“我会想到办法的，”王子想道，“我会想出来的。”

天色不早了，狂欢的人们开始摇摇晃晃地走出了大大小小的酒馆，脚步蹒跚地回家，没有人穿破衣，也没有人穿烂裤，有的人还穿着天鹅绒礼服。镇子里三分之一的狗开始吠叫。吟游歌手从肩上取下里拉琴，即兴弹奏了一首曲子。他想起了什么。

“听啊听，那些狗真的在叫，

可三条狗里只有一条在叫。

它们朝穿天鹅绒袍的人叫，

它们却从不会对我汪汪叫。”

一个说书人摇摇晃晃地走回家，上床睡觉，嘲笑这首歌，一些混混和醉鬼开始围过来倾听。

“公爵喜爱天鹅绒的礼服，

他会请你们大家喝茶去。

可是，我啊破衣又烂裤，

他从不会请我一饱口福。”

镇民们团团围住吟游歌手，又是大笑，又是欢呼。“他真大胆，穿得破衣烂裤，却在跟公爵叫板！”一个挤在人群里的农夫咯咯笑道。吟游歌手接着唱道：

“听啊听，那些狗真在叫，

公爵就喜爱那些小猫猫。

他喜欢把它们的内脏掏，

拿来猫皮做那连指手套。”

人群在敬畏和惊奇中陷入了沉默，因为镇民们知道公爵已经屠杀了十一个人，仅仅是因为他们盯着他的手，那是一双戴着天鹅绒手套的手，上面的红宝石和钻石闪闪发亮。狂欢的人群害怕被人看到，受到狂热歌手的连累，就偷偷地跑回家去告诉他们的妻子们。

只有那个以为曾在某时某地见过歌手的旅行者迟迟不去，警告他危险临近了。“我曾经见过你在竞技场上大出风头。”他说，“要么就是你在战斗中打败了骑士们，要么是把其他人像捏咸饼干一样碎成了两半。你一定是特里斯坦或兰斯洛特(2)的儿子，要么你是泰恩或托拉？”

“我是一个流浪歌手。”吟游歌手说，“一个浑身补丁破衣烂裤的人儿。”他发现自己几乎说漏了嘴，惊愕地咬住了舌头。(3)

“即使你是佐纳国强大的佐恩，”那个人说，“你也躲不过公爵的怒火。他会把你从上到下一劈两半，从这里到那里。”他碰了碰吟游歌手的肚子和喉咙。

“现在我知道要保护什么了。”吟游歌手叹道。

一个头戴天鹅绒面罩和风帽、身穿天鹅绒斗篷的黑影消失在了一棵树后面。“冷酷公爵的密探头子，”旅行者说，“一个名叫低语的人。明天他就会死去。”

吟游歌手等待着。“他之所以要死，是因为列举你的罪状的时候，他不得不提到连指手套。我要马上离开，前往他乡，因为我提到了连指手套。”他叹道，“你永远活不到娶他的侄女的那天了。你只会死去，成为他的鹅食。再见，晚安，对不起。”

旅行者突然不见了，就像一只苍蝇进了青蛙的嘴巴，吟游歌手被单独留在了漆黑荒凉的街上。不知何处，一座钟响起了无情的鸣声，钟声飘入了夜空。吟游歌手又开始唱了起来。一根柔软的手指碰了碰他的肩膀；他转过头，看到一个小个子男人在月光中微笑着，头戴一顶不成样子的帽子，两眼圆睁，露出惊讶的神情，好像每件事都是第一次发生似的，而且他留着一把有模有样的黑胡子。“要是你除了唱歌之外没有更好的表现，”他说，“你就有些比上不足，又只比下多点。”

“我会以自己的方法应付的。”吟游歌手说完，就拨动琴弦，唱了起来。

“听啊听，那些狗真在叫，

胆小鬼们正准备去睡觉。

一些人起床要迎接太阳，

可是，低语他将会消亡。”

老人脸上失去了笑容。

“你是谁？”吟游歌手问道。

“我是高乐士，”高乐士自豪地说，“世界上唯一的高乐士，不仅仅是一件工具。”

“你像一件工具，”吟游歌手说，“就像萨拉琳达如玫瑰一般。”

“在我说自己不像的东西里，我只像其中的一半。”高乐士说，“另一半像我。”他叹了口气，“人们有危险的时候，我必须到场。”

“我的危险是我自己的。”吟游歌手说。

“这危险一半是你的，一半是萨拉琳达的。”

“我没想到这一点，”吟游歌手说，“我对你有信心，你领到哪里，我就跟到哪里。”

“不要那样急，”高乐士说，“我去过的地方有一半根本不存在。我会编造一些东西。我说的东西有一半不可能找到。我年轻的时候讲过一个埋藏金子的故事，人们从几里格以外赶到树林里挖宝。我自己也挖。”

“可是，为什么？”

“我还以为藏宝的传说可能是真的呢。”

“你说过是你编造的嘛。”

“我知道我说过，但我不知道自己编造了故事。我也会忘事。”吟游歌手感到含糊不定。“我会出错，但我站在善的一边。”高乐士说，“事出偶然。我两岁那年极有可能成为恶人，但年轻的时候，我碰见一只萤火虫在蜘蛛网里燃烧。我救了那个受害者一命。”

“救了萤火虫一命？”吟游歌手问。

“救了蜘蛛一命。是那个微微闪光的纵火者给蜘蛛网放了一把火。”吟游歌手更加糊涂，但当他想着悄悄溜走的时候，城堡里响起了一阵低沉的钟声，许多灯光亮了起来，有人在大呼小叫发号施令。一连串提灯开始从黑黢黢的山上像小溪一般飞流而下。“公爵已经听到了你的歌声。”高乐士说，“肥油进火，木已成舟，把戏拆穿，鹅被煮熟，猫儿出袋。”

“考验我的时刻已经到了。”吟游歌手说。他们听到远处模糊传来了一阵刮擦声，好像有人正在石头上磨着一把铁剑。

“公爵准备拿你去喂鹅，”高乐士说，“我们必须编一个故事，让他暂停动手。”

“什么样的故事？”吟游歌手问。

高乐士说：“是一个使公爵相信，杀害你，会在别人心里点亮一盏灯的故事。他讨厌人们心里有光。所以，你必须说，公爵拿你喂鹅之后，第二天傍晚某位王子和公主就会结婚。”

“我希望你不要说这种话。”吟游歌手说。

“这故事听上去很真实，”高乐士说，“也很像巫婆的咒语。公爵敬畏巫婆的咒语。我想，我敢肯定他会暂停动手。”

脚步声越来越近了。最后，公爵的铁卫队迫近，他们的提灯、长矛和盔甲在闪闪发光。“立定！”这时传来了一阵叮叮当当的声音。

“不要逮捕我的朋友。”年轻人恳求道。

“什么朋友？”铁卫兵队长咆哮着问道。

吟游歌手环顾四周，但没有一个人。一个卫兵大笑道：“也许他看到了高乐士。”

“没有什么高乐士。我上过学，我知道。”卫队长说。吟游歌手又更糊涂了。“集合！”队长大声宣布道，“整队！”

“你们都听到他说了。整队。”中士说。他们押着吟游歌手，朝城堡里的地牢进发。一连串提灯的光亮慢慢地向山上移动。





3


第二天早晨，冷酷的公爵透过城堡里的一扇窗户凝视着外面，好像他在观看盛开的花朵或飞翔的小鸟。他望着侍从们把低语喂给鹅。他转过脸，蹒跚了三步，盯着站在城堡大厅里、两手被绑在身后的吟游歌手。“你说的这个王子是哪种人，他爱哪类少女，你能用一个没有意义的词语说一下吗？”听上去他的声音就像铁掉在天鹅绒上似的。

“是一位高贵的王子，爱一位高贵的女士。”吟游歌手说，“他们结婚时，上百万的人都会高兴。”

公爵从剑鞘里拔出宝剑，盯着它，一瘸一拐地穿过大厅，面对他的俘虏，用剑尖轻轻地点了点俘虏的喉咙，又碰了碰俘虏的屁股，叹了口气，皱了皱眉，然后收好宝剑。“我们会想出某个有趣的任务让你做，”他说，“我不喜欢你的阴谋诡计。我想，即使杀了你，也不会有什么王子或少女结婚，但我不敢保证，也把握不了。”他又咧嘴笑道，“我们会想出某个有趣的任务让你完成。”

“可我不是王子，”吟游歌手说，“只有王子，才有可能渴望牵萨拉琳达的手。”

冷酷的公爵继续咧嘴笑着说道：“那好啊，我们把你变成王子。唱歌的破衣王子。”他啪地把两只手套合在一起，两个侍从就一声不吭地出现了。“把他送进地牢，”公爵说，“给他喝水时不要给他吃面包，给他吃面包时不要给他喝水。”

侍从们正要把吟游歌手带出大厅，这时萨拉琳达公主像一片云似的顺着大理石楼梯飘来。公爵的眼睛像水晶一样闪亮。吟游歌手惊奇地凝视着。萨拉琳达公主高高的个子，黑发里插着一朵小苍兰，面色平静，像彩虹一样明艳。很难分辨她的嘴唇与玫瑰有何差别，额头与丁香有何不同。她的声音是遥远的音乐，她的眼睛像蜡烛在宁静的夜晚燃烧。她像风吹过紫罗兰花丛一般走过房间，她的笑声闪耀在空气当中，空气因她的存在而弥漫着一股梦想不到的淡淡的芳香。王子因她的美貌而呆住如冰一样不动了，但他并不寒冷，公爵寒冷，但没有冻成冰，而是举起两只戴着手套的手掌，好像她是可以暖手的一团火。吟游歌手看到血液暖暖地涌上了这个瘸子的脸颊。“这个破衣烂裤的家伙将要参与我们的小游戏。”他告诉侄女说，他的声音听上去就像铁掉在天鹅绒上似的。

“我希望他一切都好。”公主说。

吟游歌手挣脱羁绊，握住公主的手，但被公爵飞快地一剑打开。“现在把他送进地牢。”他说。他透过单片眼镜冷淡地盯着吟游歌手。“你会在那里发现最有趣的蝙蝠和蜘蛛。”

“我希望他一切都好。”公主又说道。于是，侍从们把吟游歌手送到了地牢。

等地牢的大铁门在身后当啷一声关上的时候，吟游歌手发现自己一个人在黑暗中。一只蜘蛛悬在一根蛛丝上晃来晃去。蝙蝠的唧唧叫声在四面墙之间回响。吟游歌手走了一步，避开蛇，随后某个东西蠕动了一下。“小心，”高乐士说，“你踩在了我的脚上。”

“你为什么在这里？”吟游歌手嚷道。

“我忘了一件事。我忘了公爵会给你布置的那项任务。”

吟游歌手想到公爵会让他在宽得游不过去的湖泊游泳，让他把液体变成石头，让他去寻找长骨头的无骨生物。“你是怎么来这里的？”他问，“你能离开吗？”

“我也从来不知道怎么回事，”高乐士说，“我的母亲是巫婆，但她的水平有些不够。当她设法把一件东西变成金子的时候，它变成了泥土；而当她把敌人变成鱼的时候，她得到的却都是美人鱼。”吟游歌手心里有一种不安全感。“我的父亲是巫师，”他的朋友说，“他喝醉的时候常常对自己下咒。打个火，要么点亮提灯！我抓住了一个没头的东西。”

吟游歌手瑟瑟发抖，说道：“你是来告诉我任务的。”

“我说过吗？噢，是的。我的父亲缺乏专心致志的能力，这对僧侣和牧师来说不好，对巫师来说更糟。听着。告诉公爵你会猎捕野猪、绕月旅行三次或把十一月变成六月。恳求他不要派你去找一千颗宝石。”

“那又怎样？”

“那样的话，他就会派你去找一千颗宝石。”

“可我很穷啊！”吟游歌手嚷道。

“得了，得了，”高乐士说，“你是佐纳国的佐恩。是我碰见的一个旅行者告诉我的。是他要离开镇子的时候想起来的。你父亲的坛坛罐罐里的红宝石和蓝宝石都熠熠闪光。”

“我的父亲住在佐纳国，”王子说，“这要花费我九十九天：去三十三天，回来三十三天。”

“那是六十六天啊。”

“我的父亲要花费三十三天才能做出决定。”王子说，“无论是咒语还是差使，总是有规定的时间；我的期限到的时候，我可能还在海上。”

“这是改天考虑的另一个问题，”高乐士说，“时间是对蜻蜓和天使来说的。蜻蜓活得太短了，天使活得太长了。”

佐纳国的佐恩想了一会儿，说道：“这个任务好像既奇怪又简单。”

高乐士说：“除了这座城堡里的宝石之外，这座岛上没有任何宝石。公爵不知道你是佐纳国的佐恩。他以为你是一个没有一便士或一块月光石的吟游歌手。他喜爱宝石。你已经看到他手套上的那些宝石了。”

王子踩到了一只海龟，说道：“公爵有密探，他们可能知道我是谁。”

高乐士叹了口气，说道：“我可能错了，但我们必须冒险试一下。”

轮到王子叹气了。“我希望你能更有把握。”

“我希望我能。”高乐士说，“我遗憾地说，我的母亲出生的时候只裹了一部分胎膜。我一生救了二十位王子。我没办法救所有王子。”一个东西飞快地跑过地板，要是有光线的话，就能看到它是紫色的。“公爵可能只给我三十天或四十二天时间，去找到一千颗宝石。”佐纳国的佐恩说，“他为什么要给我九十九天时间呢？”

“我是这样想的：”高乐士说，“这项任务持续越久，他就沾沾自喜越久。你知道，他喜欢沾沾自喜。”

王子在一只蛤蟆旁边坐下来，说道：“我的父亲可能丢失了自己的珠宝，要么就是送给了别人。”

“我想到了这一点，”高乐士说，“但我的计划不止一个。现在我们得睡觉了。”

他们找到了一个没有动物的角落，一直睡到了镇子里的钟表敲响午夜十二点。

门链叮当作响，大铁门开始移动。“公爵又派人来叫你了。”高乐士说，“小心你的言行。”

大铁门开始慢慢地打开。“我下次什么时候能见到你？”佐恩低声问道。没有人回答。王子在黑暗中摸来摸去，摸到了一只酷似猫的东西，他通过触摸发现那个东西没有头，但他找不到高乐士。大铁门现在大大地敞开了，地牢里充满了提灯的光亮。

“公爵下令召见你。”一个卫兵吼道，“那是什么？”

“什么是什么？”

“我不知道。”卫兵说，“我想我听见有人在大笑的声音。”

“公爵害怕笑声吗？”王子问。

“公爵什么都不怕，”卫兵说，“甚至连托德尔也不怕。”

“托德尔？”

“托德尔。”

“托德尔是什么？”

卫兵的一缕头发变白了，牙齿开始打战。“托德尔看上去像一团模糊不清的黏稠液体，”他说，“它发出的声音像兔子在尖叫，有一股没有打开过的老屋的气味。它在等着公爵的某种努力失败，比如给你布置一项你能完成的任务。”

“那要是他给我布置一项任务，我完成了呢？”王子问。

“那团液体就会吞了他，”卫兵说，“它是魔鬼的代理人，是被派来惩罚那些作恶还不算多的坏人的。我说得太多了。快点儿。公爵在等着呢。”

公爵坐在黑橡木屋里一张黑橡木桌的一端，熊熊燃烧的火把照亮了屋里，将闪闪红光照在了盾牌和长矛上面。公爵移动双手的时候，他的手套闪闪发亮。他透过单片眼镜闷闷不乐地盯着年轻的佐恩王子。公爵冷笑了一声，这使他更加冷酷。“这么说，你会猎捕野猪，”他说，“绕月旅行三次或把十一月变成六月喽。”他哈哈大笑，一支火把熄灭了。“只要萨拉琳达在，十一月就能变成六月。一头奶牛可以绕月旅行三次，甚至更多。任何人都能猎捕一头野猪。我有另一项计划给你。我昨天晚上在杀老鼠的时候想到了这一点。我要派你出去找到一千颗宝石，并把它们带回来。”

王子脸色煞白，要么就是设法变得煞白。“我是一个浪迹天涯的吟游歌手，”他说，“是一个微不足道的——”

“红宝石和蓝宝石。”公爵的咯咯笑声就像冰块在一口大锅里咯咯作响。

“因为你是佐纳国的佐恩，”他柔声低语，“你父亲的桶里、窖里、库里都装满了闪闪发光的珠宝。你不到六十六天就可以出海往返佐纳国了。”

“我的父亲总是要花费三十三天才能做出决定。”王子叫道。

公爵咧嘴笑道：“天真的王子，这正是我想要知道的。”他说，“那你要让我给你九十九天呢？”

“那才会公平，”王子答道，“可你怎么知道我是佐恩？”

“我有一个名叫倾听的密探，”公爵解释说，“他在镇子里你的住处发现了你的王子服，就带到了这里，衣服上的某些符号、印章和签名透露了你是谁。去穿上那身衣服。”他指着一段铁楼梯。“你将在门上有一颗星星会变黑的屋里找到那身衣服。穿上它回来。你离开的时候，我会想想甲虫之类的东西。”公爵一瘸一拐地走到椅边，又坐了下来。王子一边登上铁楼梯，一边想着高乐士在哪里。

他停下来，转过身，说道：“你不会给我九十九天。那么，到底有多少天？”公爵冷笑了一声。“我会想出一个愉快的天数，”他说，“去吧。”

佐恩回来的时候，身穿王室盛装，但公爵的密探已经密封上了他的宝剑，这样他就抽不出宝剑了。公爵坐在那里盯着一个头戴天鹅绒风帽和面罩、身穿天鹅绒斗篷的男人。“这是倾听，”他说，“这是聆听。”他没有所指地用剑鞘打了个手势。

“那里没有人。”佐恩说。

“聆听是无形的，”公爵解释说，“聆听可以闻知，但永远看不见。他们来这里，是了解你这项任务的特征和措施。我给你九十九小时，而不是九十九天，去找到一千颗宝石，把它们带到这里。你回来的时候，这些钟表必须都敲响五点。”

“城堡里的这些钟？”王子问，“这十三座钟？”

“城堡里的这些钟，”公爵说，“这十三座钟。”

王子看着墙上的两座钟。它们的指针都指向了四点五十分。“指针冻僵了，”王子说，“钟表死了。”

“完全正确，”公爵说，“更重要的是，你那项任务的一个迷人之处就是，除了我的金库里的那些宝石之外和这些以外，在九十九个小时能走到的距离内的地方找不到什么宝石。”他举起手套，只见它们闪闪发亮。

“一项漂亮的任务。”倾听说。

“富有创意。”聆听的声音说。

“我想你会喜欢它的，”公爵说，“开封他的宝剑。”看不见的手开封了王子的宝剑。

“要是我成功了呢？”佐恩问。

公爵向铁楼梯挥了挥一只戴着手套的手，佐恩就看到萨拉琳达站在了那里。“我希望他一切都好。”她说。她的叔叔哈哈大笑，看着佐恩。“我雇了一名巫婆，”他说，“给她施了一个小小的咒语。当她在我面前的时候，她所能说的就是：‘我希望他一切都好。’这你喜欢吗？”

“一个聪明的咒语。”倾听说。

“一个糟糕的咒语。”聆听的声音说。

王子和公主用目光无声交流，直到公爵大声喊道：“走！”萨拉琳达就消失在了楼梯上。

“要是我失败了呢？”佐恩问。

公爵从剑鞘里拔出了宝剑，手套滑过了剑锋。“我要把你从上到下一劈两半，然后把你喂托德尔。”

“我听说过那东西。”佐恩说。

公爵微微一笑，说道：“你只听说了其中的一半，另一半更糟。它是由嘴唇做成的，摸上去好像至少已经死去了十几天，但又像猴子和影子一样走来走去。”王子抽出宝剑，又放了回去。“托德尔是杀不死的。”公爵柔声说道。

“它会唧哩哩响。”倾听说。

“唧哩哩是什么？”王子问。

公爵、倾听和聆听都笑出了声。“王子，时间在浪费掉，”公爵提醒他说，“你已经只有九十八小时了。我希望你交上各种最奇特的好运。”一扇宽大的橡木门在房间尽头突然打开了，王子看到午夜的天空划过了闪电，正在下雨。“最后提醒一句，”公爵说，“我不会过分相信高乐士。他辨别不了什么能、什么不能。他很少知道应该是什么、实际是什么。”

王子瞥了倾听和公爵一眼，又瞥了一眼他认为聆听站立的地方。“当所有的钟都敲响五点的时候。”说着，他离开了房间。公爵、倾听和聆听的笑声随着他飘出了门外，飘下了楼梯，飘入了黑暗。他走出城堡几步的时候，抬起头望着一扇亮灯的窗户，想着他看到萨拉琳达公主站在那里。一朵玫瑰掉落在了他的脚边，而当他拾起玫瑰的时候，公爵、倾听和聆听在黑橡木屋里的笑声越来越大，随后渐渐地消失了。

王子离开城堡只有短短的距离，这时他感觉有一根手指轻轻地碰了一下他的胳膊肘。“是高乐士，”高乐士自豪地说，“世界上唯一的高乐士。”

王子没有心情跟着老头寻开心。在他看来，高乐士现在好像不奇妙了，就连他不成样子的帽子也突然有模有样了。“公爵认为你并不像他以为你自以为的那样聪明。”他说。

高乐士微微一笑，说道：“我认为他并不像他以为我想的那样聪明。我当时在那里。我知道那些条款。我是因为从来没有做过天使或蜻蜓，才认为只有蜻蜓和天使考虑时间。”

“你怎么在那里？”王子惊讶地问。

“我是聆听，”高乐士说，“或者至少他以为我是。千万不要相信你看不见的密探。我年纪大，公爵比我瘸。我个子矮，公爵冷酷。但是，你听起来会吃惊，就是他聪明，我比他更聪明。”

王子又鼓起了勇气，说道：“我想你是世界上最非凡的人。”

“谁从这一时刻起不这样想，谁就不知道苹果和榅桲的区别。”高乐士说。他皱了皱眉。“我们现在只有九十八个小时去寻找一千颗宝石了。”他说。

“你说过不仅仅有一个计划。”王子提醒他。

“什么计划？”高乐士问。

“你没有说过。”佐恩说。

高乐士闭上眼睛，紧握双手，说道：“从这里，不超过四十小时的距离，那里有一艘沉没的宝船。但是，细想一下，公爵洗劫了那艘船，偷走了宝石。”

“这个主意到此为止。”佐恩叹道。

高乐士又想了一下，说道：“要是有冰雹，我们可以用鲜血染红冰雹，说不定就会变成红宝石了。”

“这天气不会下冰雹。”佐恩说。

高乐士叹了口气，说道：“这个主意到此为止。”

“这任务很难，”佐恩说，“完不成。”

“我能做二十件完不成的事儿，”高乐士说，“我能找到我看不见的东西，能看见我找不到的东西。第一个是时间，第二个是我眼前的一个斑点。我能感觉到我摸不着的东西，能摸得着我感觉不到的东西。第一个是悲伤和遗憾，第二个是你的心。没有我，你会做什么？说：‘什么也做不了。’”

“什么也做不了。”王子说。

“好。要是你无助的话，我来帮你。我说过我有不止一个计划，我刚刚想起是什么计划了。这座小岛上有一个女人，她大概有八十八岁了，她具有最奇特的天赋。因为她哭泣的时候，你认为她会哭出什么吗？”

“眼泪。”佐恩说。

“是珠宝。”高乐士说。

王子盯着他，说道：“那可太了不起了。”

“我看没什么了不起的，”高乐士说，“就连卑微的牡蛎不用眼睛、手或任何工具都能产出珍珠，珍珠就是珠宝。牡蛎是一团模糊不清的黏稠液体，但女人就是女人。”

王子想起了托德尔，感觉肚子里有一点寒意。“这个奇妙的女人住在哪里？”他问。

老头咕哝了一声。“翻山过溪，历经暴雨雷鸣，在如此高或如此深的小屋里——我永远不可能记住是高还是深——肉眼看不到它。”他站起来，“我们必须上路了，”他说，“来来去去要花费我们九十小时左右。是走这条路，还是走那条路，你给我拿主意吧。”

“我怎么能呢？”王子问。

“你有一朵玫瑰，”高乐士说，“把它握在手里。”王子拿出玫瑰，握在手里，它的茎干慢慢地转动后停下来。“是这条路。”高乐士叫道，随后他们沿着玫瑰茎干指出的方向出发了。“我会告诉你哈嘉的故事。”高乐士说。

他开口说道，哈嘉十一岁那年，有一天在森林里采摘樱桃和日光兰，遇到了被捕狼圈套缠住脚的亚罗国王贵恩。“少女，为我哭泣吧，”国王说，“因为我的脚缠在了这圈套里，真是滑稽可笑。我再也动不了了，因为我已经失去了活力。我常常捻一下手指或拍一下手，就改变了人们的命运，但现在我却无法让自己的脚摆脱这东西。”

“我没有时间流泪。”少女说。她知道这圈套的机密，正要松开那只被缠住的脚，这时一个来自附近农场的农夫开始哈哈大笑。国王诅咒了他和他的妻子，把他们变成了草蜢，这种生物的脚即使没被缠住，看上去也像被缠住一样。

“瞧，这位少女已经松开了我的脚，”看到她已经解套之后，国王欢欣鼓舞，“但是，它麻木了，感觉像是别人的脚，不像是我的脚。”少女脱掉他的鞋，给他揉脚，直到感觉这脚是他的，能放下来为止。为了感谢她的好意，国王赐予她一种能力，就是让她哭泣的时候哭出来的是珠宝，而不是眼泪。人们听说国王赐予哈嘉这个奇特天赋的时候，就夜以继日，不分寒暑，从几里格以外赶来，使她伤心流泪。

尽管没有什么不幸之事发生，但她听说后，就哭泣。人们过来时心事重重，离开时都带着珍珠和红宝石。道路用珍珠铺成，红宝石在河里流动。

孩子们在街上玩着蓝宝石，狗嚼着蛋白石。每只孔雀的砂囊里至少有九颗钻石，其中一只孔雀在圣威斯脱节被剖开后，人们发现它体内居然有三十八颗钻石。

各种石头价格攀升，宝石价格下降，直到后来，谁要是让哈嘉哭泣，谁就可能会被绞死或罚钱。最后，国王下令点起一场熊熊大火，珠宝被熔化。国王颁布法令：“每年有一天，我将亲自使她哭泣，这样宝石的流量才会合理，保持平衡。”但可叹的是，无论任何悲剧或苦难，那少女都再也哭不出来了。无论是少女被龙吞杀，还是小孩子丢失，无论是伤心还是失恋，她都冷冰冰的。无论白天黑夜还是冬夏寒暑，她再也不哭了。她长到了十六岁、二十六岁、三十四岁，现在她八十八岁了，在等着你和我。“我希望这是真的。”高乐士说，“你知道，我会编故事。”

年轻王子叹了口气，说道：“我知道你会。要是哈嘉不再哭泣，她为什么要为你哭泣呢？”

高乐士仔细考虑了一下。“我感觉到她弱不禁风。我相信她悲伤难过。我希望她既没有香消玉殒，也没有奄奄一息。我会想出一件非常伤心的事儿告诉她。伤心孤独极了。拿出你的玫瑰，我想我们迷路了。”

他们如今已经陷入了荆棘丛中，他们进入的这片森林又高又密。棘尖渐渐地划破了王子的衣服。闪电划过，雷声隆隆，所有道路都不见了。王子拿出玫瑰，握在手里。花茎开始转动扭曲，指出了方向。

“绕过这条路，”高乐士说，“这边更亮。”他找到了一条直通向前的窄路。高乐士领路，他们沿着小路向前走，碰见了一个破衣烂裤的花花公子。

“我给哈嘉讲了故事，”那个人说，“但哈嘉不再哭泣了。我给她讲了恋人们四月失踪、少女们六月死去的故事。我给她讲了王子们被喂鹅的故事，甚至还给她讲了我怎么失去了最小的侄女。”

“这很伤心，”高乐士说，“越听越伤心。”

“路很长，”破衣烂裤的公子说，“越走越长。那条路一直通向山上，甚至通向更远的地方。我祝你们好运，”他说，“你们会需要好运。”他消失在了荆棘丛中。

森林里唯一的光来自闪电，当闪电划过的时候，他们望着玫瑰，跟着它指的方向走。就这样，第二天，他们走进了一条山谷。

他们看到了一个破衣烂裤的小玩偶走上前来。“我给哈嘉讲过故事，”那个人说，“但哈嘉不再哭泣了。我给她讲了恋人们在大海上迷航、在喷泉里淹死的故事。我给她讲了婴儿在树林里和山上丢失的故事。她不哭。”小玩偶说，“路很黑，越走越黑。小屋很高，甚至更高。祝你们好运。没什么了。”他消失在了石楠丛中。

荆棘和刺尖越来越密，莽莽丛林中，蟋蟀唧唧叫着。一群青蛙在更远处呱呱叫得更欢，只见它们在睡莲浮叶上绿光莹莹、鲜艳夺目。天空中传来了苍蝇的嗡嗡声。一只绵羊咩咩叫着，在齐膝深的寂静小溪中慢慢爬行，一群远行的鹅从它的身上跃过。滑溜溜的蛇在小溪中飞快地丝绸般游动，嘴里咝咝低语着罪恶的秘密。

一颗彗星呼啸着掠过空中；他们借着那道光，看到了哈嘉的小屋高高耸立在哈嘉的山上。“要是她死去的话，那里说不定就住着陌生人。”高乐士说。

“我们还剩多少小时？”王子问道。

“要是我们能让她在一小时内哭泣，”高乐士说，“我们就能勉强完成任务。”

“我希望她还活着，心里难过。”佐恩说。

“我感觉她已经死了，”高乐士叹道，“我能感觉得到。你最好背着我。我累了。”

佐纳国的佐恩背起了高乐士，将他驮到了背上。

哈嘉的山上凉飕飕的，星星们拖着尾巴掠过，不久前在地里犁出了一条条沟。一个身穿紫色劳动服的农夫一边大步走过冒烟的犁沟，一边播种。高乐士想，这里有一股气味，有点儿像空气中的永恒，但跟某种淡淡的、不大持久的气息混在一起，大概是一朵鲜花的芳香。“她的窗户里没有灯光，”高乐士说，“屋里很暗，越来越暗。”

“她的烟囱里没有冒烟，”王子说，“烟囱冰冷，越来越冷。”

高乐士简直喘不过气来，说道：“最让我担心的是门上的那个蛛网，它从铰链伸展到了门闩。”

年轻王子感觉肚子里空落落的。“敲敲她的门。”高乐士说，他的声音太高了，发着颤音。他手指交叉，并不断地使它们交叉。佐恩敲了敲门。没有人应声。“再敲一下。”高乐士嚷道，佐恩王子又敲了敲。

哈嘉在屋里。她来到门边，盯着他们。这个女人既没有死去，也没有奄奄一息，显然只有三十八九岁。高乐士把她的年龄弄错了五十岁，老年人经常出这种错误。“为我们哭泣吧，”高乐士喊道，“否则这位王子永远娶不到他的公主。”

“我没有眼泪，”哈嘉说，“我曾经为轮船过期不归哭泣，为溪流干涸哭泣，为橘子烂熟哭泣，为羊眼里飞进东西哭泣，”哈嘉说，“我不再哭泣了。”她的眼睛像沙漠一样干，嘴巴像石头做的一样。“我已经让一千个人不带一颗宝石从我的门口离开了。进来吧，”她说，“我不再哭泣了。”

屋里黑洞洞的，摆放着一张桌子、一把椅子，其中一个屋角有一个像是黄铜镶边的橡木箱子的东西。高乐士微微一笑，然后露出了伤感的神情，说道：“我有一些故事，能让刽子手哭泣，有一些故事能让怪兽的眼里流出伤心的泪水。我有一些故事，会打搅龙的睡眠，甚至能让托德尔唉声叹气。”

提到托德尔，哈嘉的头发变得灰白。“我曾经为少女们在四月的月光下嫁人哭泣。现在就连少女们六月里下葬，我也不再哭泣了。”

“你具有鱼一样的情感。”高乐士暴躁地说。他坐在地上，给她讲了国王们死亡、小孩子被戒指噎死等诸如此类的故事。

“我没有眼泪。”哈嘉说。

他给她讲了青蛙在法庭上呱呱叫，蟾蜍在大米里，毁了目瞪口呆的鸡身蛇尾怪。

“我不再哭泣了。”哈嘉说。

“瞧，”高乐士说，“还有，听着！要是那天这个年轻人不把一千颗宝石放到一张桌子上，萨拉琳达公主就绝不会嫁给他。”

“我要是能的话，”哈嘉叹道，“就会为萨拉琳达哭泣。”

王子已经漫步到了橡木箱旁边。他一只手抓住盖子，猛地掀开。一片光辉充满了房间，照亮了最黑暗的角落。只见箱子里至少有一万颗公爵需要的那种宝石。钻石闪亮，红宝石发光，蓝宝石燃烧，祖母绿仿佛在冒火。他们看着哈嘉。“这些是笑出来的珠宝，”哈嘉说，“十四天前，我醒来的时候在床上发现了它们。我在睡梦中对某件事笑出了眼泪。”高乐士两手分别抓起了一把隐约闪光的宝石，欢叫了起来。

“把它们放回去，”哈嘉说，“你一定知道，这些笑出来的珠宝总会在两周后又变成眼泪。自从我把这些漂亮东西放到这个箱子里到此刻，已有两个星期了。”

正当他们观望的时候，色泽渐渐地褪去。钻石暗淡，祖母绿熄灭，随着一阵叹息般的小小声音，哈嘉笑出来的宝石变成了眼泪。箱子里只剩下了清澈的液体，对他们秋波闪转。

“你必须想一下，”高乐士大声说道，“你必须想出来你在睡梦中对什么发笑。”

哈嘉神情茫然。“我不知道，因为那是十四天前的事儿了。”

“想一下！”高乐士说。

“想一下！”佐纳国的佐恩说。

哈嘉皱了皱眉，说道：“我从来都想不起梦见了什么。”

高乐士两手紧扣在背后，仔细想了一下，说道：“据我回忆，悲伤的宝石会永存。好心的贵恩赐予你的正是这种天赋和能力。顺便问一下，他大老远从亚罗国赶来做什么？”

“猎捕，”哈嘉说，“据我回忆，是捕狼。”

高乐士皱了皱眉。“我是一个讲究逻辑的人，有自己的方式。那个糟糕的日子发生了什么事儿，使他把悲伤看得比笑的天赋还有价值？为什么这些珠宝会在两个星期后变成泪水？”

“附近农场有一个发笑的农夫。”哈嘉说。“‘又想了一下，’好心的国王说，‘我要修改我赐予你的才能。悲伤的珠宝将会无可估量地永存，但欢笑的珠宝却可能给不了你多少快乐。’”

高乐士咕哝了一声，说道：“要是世界上有一件我讨厌的事儿的话，那就是修改。”他的眼睛变得越来越亮；随后，他拍了拍手，说道：“我要让她笑到流泪。”

高乐士给她讲起了正在发生和曾经发生过的趣事，但哈嘉的眼睛干得像石英似的，嘴唇像玛瑙造的一样。她说：“我对那些曾经发生过或正在发生的事儿笑不出来。”

高乐士微微一笑。“那我们想想将来的事儿，不是现在发生的，也绝不是过去发生的。我会想起来的。”他想啊想，随后就想到了。

“一个小伙真是糟，

只会乱把卵石抛，

手中有根木棒搅，

拉起弹弓没完了，

从来没有中过标。”

哈嘉笑得眼泪直流，七颗月光石顺着她的脸颊流下来，啪嗒啪嗒落在地上。“她流出了次等宝石！”高乐士悲叹道。他又试一下。

“一个老汉娘娘腔，

说起话来真浪荡，

叽里咕噜晃悠悠，

下巴上面口水流，

只好吃起棒棒糖。”

哈嘉笑得眼泪直流，七颗钻石顺着她的脸颊流下来，啪嗒啪嗒落在地上。“莱茵石！”高乐士咕哝道，“现在她流出了人造钻石！”

年轻王子一试身手讲了一些可笑的故事，但他煞费苦心，只得到了一些碧玺、一块猫眼石和一串珍珠。“公爵讨厌珍珠，”高乐士抱怨说，“他认为它们是鱼造出来的。”

屋里越来越暗了，他们几乎看不见了。星月都消失了。他们还是像雕塑一般站在那里。高乐士清了清嗓子。王子双臂松了又抱。随后，哈嘉莫名其妙、不合时宜地笑啊笑笑个不停。没有人说一个字，没有人讲一个故事。可能是因为猫头鹰的咕咕叫声，也可能是因为蜗牛的慢慢爬行。但是，哈嘉笑啊笑笑个不停，宝贵的珠宝闪耀着流下她的脸颊，落在地上，闪闪发亮，直到小屋里堆满了齐踝深的钻石和红宝石。高乐士数出了一千颗，把它们放进了一只随身携带的天鹅绒袋子里，叹了口气，说道：“我希望她是对我讲过的故事发笑。”

佐纳国的佐恩握住她的手。“愿上帝在冬天给你带来温暖，”王子说，“在夏天给你送去凉爽。”

“再见，”高乐士说，“谢谢你。”

哈嘉笑啊笑笑个不停，蓝宝石在地上燃烧，一路照耀着高乐士走向门口。

“我们现在还剩多少个小时？”年轻王子喊道。

“真奇怪，”高乐士喃喃自语，“我本可以赌咒说她已经死了。这是我的腹部唯一的一次撒谎。”

“我们现在还剩多少个小时？”王子恳求道。

哈嘉坐在箱子上，不停地大笑着。

“应该说，”高乐士说，“我们只剩下四十个小时了，但一路上都是下坡。”

他们走进屋外没有月亮的夜幕当中，在黑暗中环顾四周。

“我想就是这条路，”高乐士说。于是，他们就顺着他以为是的那条路走去。

“那些钟怎么办？”佐恩问道。

高乐士抱歉地出了口气，说道：“这是下一小时再考虑的问题。”

小屋里，一个比红宝石大的红色东西在珠宝里熠熠闪光。哈嘉拾起来，说道：“是一朵玫瑰。一定是他们掉落的。”

在黑橡木屋里，黄色火把熊熊燃烧，火星噼里啪啦飞溅到墙上，火光映照在长矛和盾牌上面。公爵的手套闪闪发亮。“这一夜怎么样？”他咆哮着问道。

“月亮落了，”倾听说，“我还没有听到钟声。”

“你永远不会听到的！”公爵尖叫道，“在许多个寒冷下雪的冬天之前，我杀死了这座城堡里的时间。”

倾听空洞地盯着他，似乎在咀嚼着什么东西。“这里的时间冻结了。是有人打开窗户没关。”

“呸！”公爵在桌子另一端坐下来，又站起来，一瘸一拐地来回走动。

“它在地上流出了小时和分钟的血液。是我亲眼看到的。”倾听在不断地咀嚼着什么。哥特式的窗外雷声隆隆。一只猫头鹰飞了过去。

“没有什么宝石，”公爵大声吼道，“他们只好给我带来海里的鹅卵石或草地上的云母。”他发出了可怕的笑声。“这一夜怎么样？”他又问道。

“我一直在断断续续地计数，”倾听说，“应该说他们还剩四十分钟。”

“他们绝不会成功！”冷酷的公爵尖叫道，“我希望他们淹死、断腿或迷路。”他离倾听非常近，他们的鼻子几乎贴在了一起。“他们去了哪里？”他低声沙哑地问道。

倾听后退了七步，说道：“大约七小时前，我遇见了一个花花公子。他们在去哈嘉山的路上从他身边走过。你还记得哈嘉吗？想到过她吗？”

“哈嘉不再哭泣了，”他说，“哈嘉没有眼泪了。当听说小孩子被锁在我的塔楼里的时候，她居然不哭了。”

“我讨厌这样。”倾听说。

“我喜欢，”公爵说，“任何小孩子都不能睡在我的山茶花里。”他又开始一瘸一拐地走动，盯着窗外的夜空。“聆听在哪里？”他问道。

“他跟着他们，”倾听说，“高乐士和王子。”

“我不相信他。”公爵咆哮着说，“我喜欢一个我能看到的密探。让我身边有一些看得见的人。”他朝楼梯上大声喊：“聆听！”又向窗外喊：“聆听！”但是，没有人应声。“我很冷。”他粗声粗气地说。

“你总是冷。”

“我更冷了，”公爵咆哮说，“千万不要告诉我我总是什么！”他拔出宝剑，向空洞寂静处乱砍了一阵。“我想念低语。”

“你拿他喂鹅了，”倾听说，“它们好像喜欢他。”

“安静！那是什么声音？”

“听上去像什么？”

“好像是王子们在偷偷地上楼梯，好像是萨拉琳达离开了。”公爵一瘸一拐地走到铁楼梯边，又一次向寂静空洞处乱砍了一阵。“摸上去他是什么样？你摸过他吗？”

“聆听？他身高五英尺，”倾听说，“他留有络腮胡，头上戴的东西我描述不出来。”

“高乐士！”公爵尖叫道，“你摸到的是高乐士！我雇了他做密探，自己却不知道。”

带有金星的紫球从铁楼梯上慢慢地弹跳下来，一闪一闪的，就像赤身裸体的小孩子向牧师敬礼一样。

“这是什么傲慢无礼的东西？”公爵问道，“那东西是什么？”

“是一颗球。”倾听说。

“这我知道！”公爵尖叫道，“可是，为什么？它可怕地出现，是什么意思？”

“在我看来，”倾听说，“它很像高乐士和那些孩子玩过的一颗球。”

“他们在他那边！”公爵非常生气，“他们的幽灵在他那边。”

“他有许多朋友。”倾听说。

“安静！”公爵吼道，“他连哪个死了、哪个快死都不知道，也不知道他从哪里来、要去哪里，更不知道哪些表会敲响、哪些钟永远敲不响。”

“是什么让我认为他知道呢？”这个密探停止咀嚼。一个好像之前从来没有人见过的东西沿着楼梯小跑下来，穿过了房间。

“那是什么？”公爵脸色苍白地问。

“我不知道它是什么，”倾听说，“但这是至今唯一的东西。”

公爵戴着手套的双手在颤抖，微微发光。“我要把他们抛上天，让托德尔和鹅去争抢！我要把他们锁进地牢，跟那个无头东西关在一起！”提到托德尔，倾听的天鹅绒面罩变得灰白。公爵的眼珠在眼窝里向上翻转。“我要把他们统统杀光！”他说。“这个宝贝和她的追求者，还有这个斗鸡眼小丑！你听见我说的话了吗？”

“听见了，”倾听说，“但有一些规矩、礼节和仪式，比钟声和山上的积雪还老。”

“继续说。”公爵轻声说着，抬头望了一眼楼梯。

“你必须让他们有时间和机会使城堡的钟表敲响五点。”

“城堡里的钟被谋杀了，”公爵说，“一个下雪的早晨，我亲手杀死了这里的时间。在我这袖子上，你还能看到褐色血斑，秒针流血死在了这里。”他哈哈大笑，“还有什么？”他问。

“你像我一样清楚，”倾听说，“王子必须有机会和时间把一千颗宝石放到那边的桌子上。”

“要是他做到了呢？”

“他就会牵萨拉琳达公主的手。”

“是城堡唯一温暖的手，”公爵说，“谁失去萨拉琳达，谁就会失去火。我是说落日的火，而不是宝石冷淡无趣的火焰。她的眼睛是圣殿里燃烧的蜡烛。在我看来，她的脚像一对白鸽。她的手指如鲜花盛开在胸前。”

倾听说：“很少有人以这种方式说起自己的侄女。”

“她不是我的侄女！她是我偷来的！”公爵嚷道，“她是我从一位国王的城堡里偷的！我从沉睡的王后的胸前夺走了她。我的两只手上还留有她咬我的痕迹。”

“王后咬的？”倾听问。

“是公主。”公爵吼道。

“是哪个国王？”倾听问。

他的主人皱了皱眉，说道：“我不知道。我的船在风暴中搁浅在了一座岛上。没有月亮，没有星星。城堡里没有灯光。”

“那你怎么找到公主的呢？”倾听问。

“她身上有一道光芒，”公爵说，“她像一颗星星闪耀在她母亲的胸上。我知道我的城堡里必须有那种光芒。我打算把她留在这里，直到她二十一岁。她到了那天，我要娶她，明天那个日子就到了。”

“你以前为什么不娶她？”倾听问，“这座城堡是你的王国。”

公爵微微一笑，露出了上牙。“因为她的保姆是一个女巫，她给我施了咒语。”

“什么咒语？”倾听问。

“我要等到她二十一岁那天才能娶她，明天那个日子就到了。”

“你先前说过一次了。”

“我必须让她待在一间受不到我的伤害的屋里。我已经那样做了。”

“我喜欢这个条件。”倾听说。

“我讨厌。”公爵咆哮着说，“我必须赐予任何王子向她求婚的权利。我也已经那样做了。”他在桌边坐下来。

“在这种魔法中，”倾听咀嚼着说，“总会发现一个缝隙或漏洞，因而，无论你布置什么任务，那位正好能配得上公主的王子就能娶她。女巫对这一部分是怎么说的？”

“就像这样。‘只有名字既是X开头又不是X开头的王子才能救她，而你也会消亡。’根本没有一个王子的名字既是X开头又不是X开头的。”

倾听的面罩滑落下来，但还没等公爵看到他眼里的笑意，他便又戴了上去。“这个王子，”倾听说，“就是佐纳国的佐恩，但让你恐惧和反感的是，他曾扮成吟游歌手。这样，他的名字既是兴谷（Xingu），又不是兴谷。这就是那位名字既是X开头又不是X开头的王子。”

公爵的宝剑开始颤抖。“谁都没有对我说过。”他对自己低声说道。

又有一颗球弹跳着滚下了楼梯，那是一颗印有猩红色猫头鹰图案的黑球。冷酷的公爵望着它滚过了地板，大声问道：“这是什么无礼的东西？”

倾听走到楼梯边听了听，转身说道：“楼上有人。”

“是那些小孩子！”公爵声音嘶哑地说。

“孩子们死了，”倾听说，“我听到的是活人发出的脚步声。”

“他们还剩下多少时间？”公爵大声问道。

“我想还有半小时。”倾听说。

“跟我玩游戏，我要一剑刺破他们的喉咙！”公爵向楼梯走去，却又停下了脚步，“他们所有人都在那上面。叫卫兵来！”他狂叫道。

“卫兵们在守卫着钟。”倾听说，“是你要求那样做的。共有十一个卫兵，每个守卫一座钟。你和我守这两个。”他指着墙上的两座钟。“是你要求那样做的。”

“叫卫兵来。”公爵又重复道，他的密探叫来了卫兵们。他们像机器一样列队走进了房间。公爵一瘸一拐地上了楼梯，拔出的宝剑寒光闪闪。

“跟着我！”他嚷道，“那就再玩一次游戏！我要杀了高乐士和王子，然后娶萨拉琳达！”他在前领路。卫兵们像机器一样蹦上了楼梯。倾听露出了微笑，又细想了一下，跟着他们上楼。

黑橡木屋沉默了七秒钟。随后，墙里的一扇密门打开了。高乐士溜进了房间。公主跟在后面。他攀着葡萄藤爬进了萨拉琳达的房间，双手刺痛发红。“没有我的玫瑰，你们怎么能在黑暗中找到城堡呢？”公主问，“他不让我点火把。”

“你像星星一样照亮了你的窗户，我们从远处就能看到城堡。”高乐士说，“我们的时间就剩几分钟了。启动钟表吧！”

“我启动不了钟表。”公主说。

他们听到上方远远地传来了搏斗声。“他要对付十三个人，”她叫道，“那很难。”

“我们要对付十三座钟表，”高乐士说，“那更难。启动钟表吧！”

“我怎么能启动钟表呢？”公主恸哭道。

“雪冷冰冰的，你的手更温暖，”高乐士说，“用你的手触摸第一座钟。”公主把一只手贴在钟上。什么也没有发生。

“我们完了。”高乐士坦白地说，萨拉琳达的心跳停止。她喊道：“用魔法！”

“我没有什么魔法可用，”高乐士抱怨说，“试试另一座钟吧。”

公主试了试另一座钟，还是什么都没有发生。“那就用逻辑！”她喊道。他们听到铁卫兵在密墙里咚咚咚地追赶佐恩，越来越近了。

“现在让我想想，”高乐士说，“要是你能摸到钟，却永远启动不了，那你启动钟就根本不用摸它们。就我所知，这就是逻辑，我也是这样用的。把你的手放这么远。好了，就那么远。再近点儿！好，稍远点儿。再远点儿。就那里！我想可以了！不要动！”

钟表阻塞僵硬的机件开始呼呼转动。他们听到了一声嘀嗒，又一声嘀嗒。萨拉琳达公主像穿过苜蓿间的风一样，从一个房间逃到另一个房间，将一只手放在距离钟表合理距离的地方。秃鹫般的东西展翅离开了城堡。“那是当时那个时刻。”高乐士说。

“这是现在这个时刻！”萨拉琳达喊道。

一朵从来没有开过的牵牛花在院子里盛开了。一只从来没有啼叫过的公鸡开始啼叫。晨光映照窗户，冷酷的公爵在墙里悲叹道：“我听到了时间的声音。可是，我杀死了它，并在它的胡须上擦拭血染的宝剑。”他认为佐纳国的佐恩已经逃离了那些卫兵。他的宝剑在黑暗中不断地呼呼作响；有一次，他砍到了自己的左膝——他以为那是高乐士。“出来，你这哼哼的无赖！”他嚷道，“站出来，佐纳国的佐恩！”

“他不在这里。”密探说。

他们听到了铿锵凶猛的击剑声。“他们抓住他了！”公爵尖叫道，“十一个人对付一个！”

“你可能听说过加拉哈德，”倾听说，“他的力量能以一当十。”

“那还剩下一个人能搞定他，”公爵嚷道，“我就指望克朗了，他是我最强壮的卫兵，除了一个人之外，他是世界上最出色的剑客。一位身披盔甲、不知姓名的王子一年前在一座岛上的某个地方战胜了他。别人可做不到。”

“那位不知姓名的王子，”倾听说，“就是佐纳国的佐恩。”

“那我要亲手杀了他！”公爵的声音抬高，顺着漆黑隐秘的楼梯回荡，“我用这只抓住你胳膊的血手杀死了时间，时间可比佐纳国的佐恩强大多了！”

倾听又开始细想。“任何凡人都谋杀不了时间。”他说，“就是他能杀死，也还有别的东西：少女心中的钟表装置，它敲响青春和爱的时刻，既会识别南飞的天鹅和冬雪，也会识别夏日的午后和郁金香时节。”

“你这巧克力一样的唠叨让我恶心，”公爵咆哮说，“你的舌头是糖果做的吧。要是克朗没有灭了他，那我就杀死这个破衣王子。要是有光亮的话，我就会给你看看秒针原来留在我的袖子上的褐色血迹，它们流血死在了那里。我在这些昏暗里杀死了时间，并擦了擦染血的剑锋——”

“啊，闭嘴，”倾听说，“你是世界上最好斗的坏蛋。我总想告诉你这一点。我说过，我很高兴。”

“安静，”公爵吼道，“我们在哪里？”他们踉踉跄跄地走下了秘密楼梯。

“这是通往橡木屋的密门。”倾听说。

“开门。”公爵手握宝剑吼道。倾听摸索着找到了隐秘的门把手。





8


熊熊燃烧的火把照亮了黑橡木屋，但萨拉琳达的光芒更亮。公爵冷酷的眼睛被桌子上摆的一千颗宝石照得眼花缭乱。钟表敲响的时候，他的耳朵里嗡嗡作响。

“一！”倾听说。

“二！”佐纳国的佐恩喊道。

“三！”公爵近乎低语说。

“四！”萨拉琳达叹道。

“五！”高乐士欢叫着，指向桌子说，“任务完成了，条件满足了。”

公爵冷酷的眼睛慢慢地环顾房间。“我的卫兵们在哪里？”他声音嘶哑地问道，“克朗是所有人中最伟大的，他在哪里？”

“我把他们引诱到了塔楼，”佐恩说，“锁了进去。那个被绳结绑住的就是克朗。”

公爵怒视着桌子上的宝石，说道：“它们是假的！它们一定是彩色鹅卵石！”他拿起一颗，看出是真的，又把它放了下来。

“任务完成了，”倾听说，“条件满足了。”

“要等我数完为止，”公爵说，“只要这里少了一颗，我明天就要娶萨拉琳达公主。”房间里的人影都一动不动，他能听到他们的呼吸声。

“这样对待自己的侄女，真可怕。”高乐士嚷道。

“她不是我的侄女，”瘸子冷笑道，“她是我从一个国王那里偷来的。”他露出了下牙。“我们大家都有缺陷，”他说，“而我的缺陷就是邪恶。”他在桌边坐下来，开始数起了那些宝石。

“那谁是我的父亲？”公主大声问道。

密探抬了抬黑眉毛。“我还以为高乐士告诉过你呢。不过，当然，他从来记不住东西。”

“尤其是国王的名字。”高乐士说。

“你的父亲，”密探说，“是亚罗国的明君贵恩。”

“这我曾经知道，”高乐士说，“但我忘了。”他转向萨拉琳达。“这么说，是你的父亲赐予哈嘉的天赋，最后使你能获得幸福。”

公爵抬起头，露出了牙齿，咆哮说：“这个故事过于有板有眼，不合我的口味。我讨厌它。”他继续数着宝石。

倾听说：“这个故事干净利索，让人清爽，合我的口味。”他摘去面罩，眼睛明亮欢快。“请允许我介绍自己，”他说，“我是国王——就是亚罗国的明君贵恩的仆人。”

高乐士说：“这我过去不知道。你本可以多年前就拯救公主的。”

国王的仆人一副伤心的样子，说道：“我一向不喜欢说起这一部分，但我被一个女巫施了魔法。”

“我讨厌女巫，”高乐士说，“这并不是不尊重我的母亲。”

公爵面带微笑，露出了上牙，咕哝道：“我甚至无法信任我看得到的密探。”他的眼睛迟钝地转动，看到了高乐士。“你只是工具！”他咆哮说，“你这陈词滥调！你这机器神高乐士！”

“请安静，”高乐士说，“你这闪光的小偷。”

“九百九十八，”公爵数道，“九百九十九。”他数完了所有的宝石，把它们放进了一个袋子里。桌子上什么东西也没有留下。他对大家露出了可怕的喜色。“公主属于我。”公爵说。

一片死寂弥漫了整个房间。高乐士变得有点儿苍白，一只手开始哆嗦。他记起了黑暗中有一个东西从哈嘉的山上下来，撞在了他的脚踝上，是一颗蓝宝石或红宝石从袋子里掉了出来。“一千。”公爵大声惊叹道。是一颗钻石从他的左手那只手套上掉了下来，只有高乐士看到它掉落。公爵站起来，冷笑了一声。“你们在等什么？”他尖叫道，“离开！就是你们永远消失，也不够久！就是你们不再回来，我也会觉得时间太短！”他慢慢地转向佐恩，“这是什么样的绳结啊？”他咆哮说。

“花箍结，”年轻王子说，“我是从姐姐那里学的。”

“滚开！”冷酷的公爵尖叫着，把两只手伸进了红宝石，“我的宝石。”他嘶哑着声音说，“将会永存。”从来没有偷笑过的高乐士偷偷地笑了。橡木屋的两扇大门打开了，他们留下冷酷的公爵站在那里，钻石都埋住了他的手腕。

“亚罗国，”王子说，“在我们这次旅行的半路上。”他们站在城堡外面。

“你会需要这些的。”高乐士说。他抓起两匹白马的缰绳，“你们的船停靠在港口，一小时内就要启航了。”

“船要午夜才启航。”倾听纠正他说。

“我不可能记住所有的一切，”高乐士说，“我父亲的钟当时总是走慢。他也缺乏专心致志的能力。”

佐恩扶着公主骑上马鞍。她最后凝望了城堡一眼。“一股顺风吹向亚罗国。”王子说。

高乐士凝视了公主最后一眼，说道：“保持热情。一起赶路。记住笑声。即使在那座幸福的‘从此’岛上，你们也需要记住这一点。”

“马厩里没有马，”王子沉思道，“这些白马是哪里来的？”

“高乐士有好多朋友，”倾听说，“我猜是他们在他需要的时候给了他一些马。不过，这两匹马也可能是他编造的。你知道，他喜欢编造一些东西。”

“我知道他会编造，”佐纳国的佐恩叹道，“你跟我们一起乘船去亚罗国吗？”

“我必须再待两个星期，”倾听答道，“女巫给我施的魔法就是这样。这会让我有时间收拾一下，也可以给克朗松一下绑。”

他们四处寻找那个老工具，但他已经不在那里了。“他到哪里去了？”萨拉琳达大声问道。

“噢，”倾听说，“他知道好多地方。”

萨拉琳达说：“把我的爱带给他，还有这个。”倾听接住了玫瑰。

两匹白马在通向港口的凉飕飕的绿色林间空地上喷出了白蒙蒙的雾气。一股顺风吹向了亚罗国。眺望大海，萨拉琳达公主认为她看到了——就像在晴朗无风的日子里人们经常认为自己看到的那样——只见远处“从此”岛的海岸上正闪闪发亮。你们的猜测跟我的完全一样（有许多闪光的东西），但我总认为，以后也总会认为，她看到了。





尾声


两个星期后，公爵正在橡木屋里贪婪地看着他的那些宝石，这时随着叹息般的一声小小响动，宝石突然变成了眼泪。他那副闪闪发亮的手套的流苏染上了哈嘉的笑声。他踉踉跄跄地站起来，抽出宝剑，大声喊道：“低语！”城堡院子里，六只受惊的鹅不再寻找蜗牛，抬起头望着橡木屋。“这黏稠液体是什么东西？”公爵高声叫道，桌子上那摊已经融化、闪着邪光的宝石让他反感。他的单片眼镜掉落，他挥剑向寂静的虚空处乱砍了一阵。既像猴子又像影子的东西穿过了房间。墙上的火把熄灭了，两座钟停止了，房间变得更冷。有一股没有打开的老屋的气息，还传来了兔子的尖叫声。“来吧，你这黏稠液体！”冷酷的公爵吼道，“你可能会把章鱼吓死，你这个仇恨和霹雳的胖子，但棺材城堡的公爵不会！”他冷笑道。“既然我那些珍贵的宝石已经变成了黏稠液体，独自活在寒冷中，这就不是我最喜欢的心愿！警惕，你这个发霉的沙发！”托德尔唧哩哩地吞咽起来。一阵憋闷的尖叫声后，一片寂静。

倾听走进屋里，将一盏提灯举到头顶，但那里没有人。公爵的宝剑躺在地上，隐约闪现。哈嘉笑出来的宝石从桌子上滴下来，不像悲伤的宝石，笑出来的宝石无法永远存在，而是在两个星期后变成了眼泪。倾听踩住了一个东西。它在倾听的脚下扭动，朝墙上吐唾沫。他拾起来，把它举到提灯边看，那是一只印着猩红色猫头鹰图案的小黑球。棺材城堡公爵的最后一位密探孤零零地待在昏暗的房间里，认为他听到了从远处某个地方传来了某个人的笑声。

神奇的O


1


某个地方，一座笨重的钟表在昏暗中缓缓地敲了十二下。暴雨云沿着地平线低低地疾驰，没有月亮照耀。只有青蛙忧伤的合唱打破了无声的寂静。随后，昏昏沉沉的夜色中出现了一个陌生的人影，就像在催眠曲中出乎意料地传来了一阵刺耳的号角声。他走进海边酒馆，一片刀光闪过黑暗，当老橡木门又一次关上的时候，刀光就消失了。

新来的人是一个海员。酒客们看到他，都静了下来。这个人的肩上有一只绿鹦鹉，一条焦油似的辫子垂在背后。因为他两条腿都有，所以没有拄拐杖，但他走路说话的时候却像鹅一样摇摆。他说话的时候，声音深沉得像在坟墓里敲锣似的。

“叫我小杰克！”他吼道。于是，酒客们都喊他小杰克。

一个瘦削沉默的男人坐在角落里的一张光线昏暗的桌边。只见他身穿黑色披风，戴着黑色手套，当新来的人在他对面坐下来之后，他就向新来的人招手致意。“看上去你像一个带地图的人。”黑衣人低声说道。

“我是一个带地图的人。”小杰克声音低沉而洪亮地说，“这是一座遥远孤岛的地图。这座孤岛富产宝石，有蓝宝石、绿宝石和红宝石。我寻找一个有船的人。”

“我是一个有船的人。”黑衣人说。

“配有船员吗？”

“配有船员。”

“你是一个有名字的人吗？”小杰克问。

“我名叫布莱克。”这个名叫布莱克的人说。他们握了握手，一只手厚重赤裸，另一只手瘦弱，戴着手套。随后，他们在一点钟达成了协议。“三分之二战利品归你和我，剩下的三分之一给船员们。”

布莱克露出了微笑，他微笑的时候露出了下排牙。“现在让我看看地图。”说着，他拿过地图研究起来。“这里没有叉号，”布莱克说，“也没有标记。这里应该有叉号和标记，指出珠宝藏在哪里。”

“还有一张地图上有标记和叉号，但它遭遇了什么、现在哪里，谁也说不清。”小杰克说。

“我们会找到地图的，要是找不到，没有地图，我们也会找到宝石。”布莱克宣称。他凝视着小杰克，好像这个水手是块数太多或块数不足的七巧板。“你有过去男人的风采和举止。你从哪里来？”

小杰克咧开嘴笑了。“不是完全内陆地区，伙计。我要拿着地图。”

“我带着安全。”布莱克说。

“我们一分为二更安全。”说着，小杰克用弯刀把地图划为两半。随后，布莱克拿了其中一半，小杰克拿了另一半。

两点钟，他们上了船。“我读不出来这船的名字，”小杰克说，“应该是怎么叫的？”

“唉咿哎哟（Aeiu）(1)。”布莱克说。

“一个怪异离奇的名字，”水手说，“听上去有点儿像夜莺在尖叫。”

“除了O，它有所有的元音。”布莱克说，“自从我妈被卡在舷窗的那个夜晚之后，我就憎恨这个字母。我们没办法拉她进来，所以只好推她出去。”他瑟瑟发抖，目光变得冷酷。“那座岛的名字叫什么？”他摆脱了有关O的想法，问道。

“哦哦啰哦哦（Ooroo）。”小杰克说，另一位又一次瑟瑟发抖。

“我讨厌这个名字，”他最后说，“听上去就像两个鬼的眼睛靠在R的身上。我自己说带O的词，所以能把它们说出来。”有东西尖叫了一声。“是一只夜莺。”布莱克低声说道，“水手们说夜莺是我的妈妈。我们到下面去吧。我有满满一舱朗姆酒。”





2


唉咿哎哟号的船帆黑得像乌黑的翅膀，黎明到来的时候，即使最尖的眼睛和最棒的望远镜，也不能再从岸上看到它。天气晴朗，航程漫长。后来，有一天早晨，轮船驶进了遥远孤岛仅有的港口，布莱克和小杰克走上岸，前者弱不禁风，后者大摇大摆，粗暴无礼、肌肉发达的船员跟在后面。

“我们是为你们的宝石而来的。”布莱克对那些沉默者的一个发言人说，“我们带有弯刀和手枪。”

“还带有斧头、铁锹和木棒。”小杰克说。

“我们没有宝石，”发言人说，“只有蓝色的水，只有少女的粉颊和红唇，只有绿色田野。”

“我们是为你们的宝石而来。”布莱克重复道。

“我们只有月长石、蛋白石和其他普通石头。”发言人说。

“普通石头、普通石头！”绿鹦鹉粗声叫道。

“有一张地图，”布莱克说，“一张秘密地图，上面有表明藏宝地方的标记和叉号。”

“我不知道有这种地图。”发言人说。

布莱克咧嘴一笑，又露出了下排牙，大声嚷道：“拆掉这个镇子。”于是，船员们开始用斧头、铁锹和木棒拆掉镇子，砸掉门锁，撬开箱盖，破开衣柜和碗柜，但他们发现的都是月长石（moonstone）、蛋白石（opal）和其他普通石头（other ordinary stones），盒式吊坠（lockets）和爱情信笺，期权文书（option）、合同（contract）、抵押字据（mortgage）、记录（record）、报告（report）和其他文件（other documents），既没有宝石，也没有任何地图。

“在树林里挖。”布莱克命令道。

“在草地里挖。”小杰克吩咐道。于是，船员们在树林里和草地里挖，但他们发现的都是橡树里的猫头鹰（owls in oaks），苔藓（moss）和鼹鼠（mole），蟾蜍（toad）和毒菌（toadstool），树根（root）和岩石（rock）。

“排干小溪。”布莱克咆哮说。

“排干池塘。”小杰克吼道。于是，船员们排干了小溪和池塘，但他们发现的都是鳟鱼（trout）和乌龟（tortoise），青蛙（frog）和蠕虫（worm），一只淹死在池塘里的猫头鹰。

“橡树里的猫头鹰，池塘里的猫头鹰！”鹦鹉粗声叫道。

于是，船员带着斧头和木棒，转向一座座塔和一处处喷泉，但他们汗流满面、千辛万苦得到的只是建塔（tower）的石头和闪亮的喷泉（fountain）水。

那天夜里，布莱克和小杰克坐在一家酒馆的桌边，用大酒杯喝着朗姆酒。“一定有蓝宝石。”布莱克低声说道。

“还有绿宝石和红宝石。”小杰克嘟囔道。

“蛋白石和月长石，”鹦鹉粗声叫道，“爱情信笺、盒式吊坠和期权文书。橡树里的猫头鹰、青苔、鼹鼠和抵押字据。”

“不要让它嘎嘎叫了，”布莱克大声嚷道，“否则我就握住它的喉咙，让它只能哼哼。”

“它只能哼哼，它只能哼哼。”鹦鹉粗声叫道。

“尽管如此，但我很高兴他列出了我们找到的东西。”过了一会儿，布莱克说：“我们找到的所有东西的名字里都有O，我们看的每个地方的名字里都有O，还有我们打开的所有东西——衣柜（closet）、碗柜（cupboard）、树林（wood）和草地（meadow）。”

“地板（floor）和屋顶（roof），”小杰克补充说，“小溪（brook）和池塘（pool）。”

酒馆的钟表嘀嗒了六十次，布莱克凝视着酒杯。“我讨厌名字里带O的东西，”布莱克嚷道，“因此也讨厌钟表（clock）和鹦鹉（parrot）。”他把酒杯扔向钟表，砸开了钟表，但里面只有齿轮，没有红宝石，没有绿宝石，没有蓝宝石，也没有地图。

“鹦鹉的名字叫玛格若，”小杰克说，“里面没有O。”

“握住它的喉咙，”鹦鹉粗声叫道，“握住它的喉咙！”

“那里面也没有O。”小杰克说。

布莱克站起来，拳头砸在了桌子上。“我要把所有的O都除掉，无论是大写字母还是小写字母！”这个黑衣人嚷道，“我要发布一条法令。书上和标牌上所有带O的词都要擦掉或涂掉O。我们要印刷不带O的新书，涂上不带O的新标牌。”

于是，锁匠（locksmith）就变成了苏匠（lcksmith），靴匠（bootmaker）就成了革匠（btmaker）；人们说这些名字的时候，就像阴谋家一样窃窃私语。《爱的徒劳》（Love's Labor's Lost）和《鹅妈妈童谣》（Mother Goose）像被扎破的气球一样变得扁平。书（book）成了术（bk），罗宾汉（Robinhood）成了鲁宾又（Rbinhd）。两只小好鞋（Little Goody Two Shoes）(2)失去了O，金凤花姑娘（Goldilocks）(3)也一样。前者变成了窃窃私语，后者听上去像钥匙在苏孔里抖动。也不可能朗读《喔喔公鸡》（cockadoodledoo）了，父母亲们不再给孩子们念，有些人完全放弃了朗读，而寻找宝石的行动还在继续。

酒馆之夜后的那天下午，因为O被从书上和标牌上消除，所以奶午（cw，应为cow）跃过了月求（mn，应为moon），碟子带着羔匙（spn，应为spoon）一块潜逃(4)，钟表店（clockshop）变成了中表占（clckshp），玩具师（toymaker）成了元具师（tymaker）。布莱克发布了新的搜查令。“查一下小提琴（violin）和大提琴（cello）！”他命令道。

“查一下长号（trombone）、号角（horn）和双簧管（oboe）。”小杰克雷鸣般吼道。船员们在小提琴、大提琴、长号、号角、双簧管、短笛（piccolo）和班卓琴（banjo）里查找，但一无所获，因为除了音乐，里面什么也没有。

那天夜里在酒馆里，喝完十三品脱朗姆酒之后，布莱克开始用秃鹰般的音质唱起了一首小曲：

“我不愿沿着讨厌的（horrible）街道走，

去看那些讨厌的人渣（people）。

我乐意爬上糟糕的楼梯，

它通向可怕的尖塔。

还有可怕的蝙蝠和可怕的老鼠。

以及可怕尖塔里的那些猫咪。

可我不愿沿着讨厌的街道走，

去看那些讨厌的人渣。”

他唱歌的时候，酒客们都盯着他，然后他们没有喝完就付账，悄悄地溜进了夜幕里。

“我认为，人们讨厌你的声音和你的歌。”小杰克说。

“我要从他们身边夺走，”布莱克说，“一切能弹奏的、带O的东西。”

于是，第二天早上，船员们挨家挨户地夺走了小提琴和大提琴，夺走了长号、号角和双簧管，夺走了钢琴（piano）、大键琴（harpsichord）和击弦古钢琴（clavichord），夺走了手风琴（accordion）和簧风琴（melodeon），夺走了巴松管（bassoon）和萨克斯风（saxophone），夺走了所有其他名字带O的乐器，乃至包括木管乐器（woodwind）。一对喜欢以曼陀林（mandolin）和钟琴（glockenspiel）表演二重奏的夫妻各奔东西。由于禁止使用梳子（comb），因此孩子们再也不能用裹着薄纸的梳子吹曲。船员们又花费了一个下午砸碎了一架在田野里发现的陈旧生锈的汽笛风琴（calliope），并拆散了一架排钟（carillon）。

“他们拥有的只是横笛、鼓和钹了。”布莱克扬扬得意地说。

“还有古筝和吉他，”小杰克说，“扬琴、转子、军号、竖琴和小号。”

“他们会从这些或其他任何东西中得到很多好处。”布莱克说，“我还没有清除完音乐里、和声里和旋律里——也就是作曲里——的O。他们将不会有乐谱（score），尤其是不会有管弦乐队（orchestra）、指挥台（podium）、指挥棒（baton）和指挥（conductor）。他们演奏不了交响乐（symphony）、狂想曲（rhapsody）、奏鸣曲（sonata）和协奏曲（concerto）。我要夺走他们的清唱剧（oratorio）、唱诗班（choir）和合唱队（chorus），要夺走他们所有的独唱者（soloist）、男中音（baritone）、男高音（tenor）和女高音（soprano），要夺走他们的中音部（alto）、女低音（contralto）和伴唱（accompanist）。他们所有的只是送葬曲、圣歌、颂歌、挽歌和某些歌曲片段。”

“他们还会有小夜曲。”小杰克说。

布莱克恶狠狠地打了个不耐烦的手势，说道：“要是没有阳台（balcony），你就不能在阳台上为一位小姐演唱小夜曲。让他们哼他们的赞美诗，口齿不清地念他们的连祷文。”当布莱克念出一些即将消失的带O的名字的时候，他的眼睛开始熠熠闪光。“诙谐曲（scherzo）、广板（largo）、渐强（crescendo）、快板（allegro）、减弱（diminuendo）。让词作者们来个六月之夜。没有月亮（moon），那会给他们很多好处。”他在手里捏碎了一个虚构的月亮。“至少人们跳不了波尔卡舞（polka）、慢步圆舞（schottische）和加伏特舞（gavotte）。我希望他们在这R岛上为自己的损失哀悼，但他们不会。”

“R岛？”小杰克问。

“我已经夺去了Ooroo里的O，”布莱克解释说。“名字带O的小岛寥寥无几，而且总是倒霉，比如沉没在海里的莱昂尼斯岛（Lyonese）。我已经列出了还在屹立的小岛的一份清单，这些小岛没有丝毫O。这一定有些道理。”他从口袋里掏出一张羊皮纸，朗读那些不带O的小岛的名字：“冰岛、格陵兰、英格兰、威尔士和爱尔兰；泽西岛；根西岛、曼岛和怀特岛；卡普里岛、克里特岛和塞浦路斯；厄尔巴岛、马耳他岛和圣赫勒拿岛；马达加斯加岛、桑给巴尔岛、撒丁岛——”

“圣赫勒拿岛和厄尔巴岛，”小杰克说，“对拿破仑来说并不幸运。”

“拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoleon Bonaparte），”布莱克说，“出生在科西嘉岛（Corsica）。他的厄运就是从那里开始的。”随后，他继续念起了清单：“巴厘岛和巴利阿里群岛，菲律宾群岛和西里伯斯群岛，斐济群岛和赫布里底群岛，古巴群岛和百慕大群岛，东印度群岛和西印度群岛，小安的列斯群岛和大安的列斯群岛，马提尼克岛和特立尼达岛，复活节岛和牙买加岛，处女岛和加那利群岛，西西里岛、海地和夏威夷。给海地（Haiti）加一个T就成了塔希提岛（Tahiti）。”还没有念完清单，他的声音就哑了。

小杰克闭上一只眼睛，说道：“你漏掉了一个。我的一个名叫冈恩的朋友生活在那里，要是你可以称为生活的话。”

“它的名字，”布莱克低声说道，“叫金银岛(5)。”

那天夜里，镇子上的人和那些住在乡下的人在树林里秘密会面。他们是被一个名叫安德雷乌斯的诗人召集在一起的。他朗读或试图念他刚印好的一首诗，名为“月求尸于受人”（The Mn Belngs T Lvers，应为The Moon Belongs to Lovers），但诗意因O的消亡而消亡。“不久，布莱克和小杰克，”安德雷乌斯说，“就不会再让我们住在房子（house）里了，因为房子有一个O。”

“农舍（cottage）也不让，”铁匠说，“因为农舍也有一个O，平房（bungalow）也一样。”

“我们只好住在小棚子里，”面包师傅说，“要么住在棚屋、工具棚、铁皮棚子，要么住在小木屋。”

“没有原木（log）的小屋，”安德雷乌斯说，“我们可有壁炉架，但不可有钟表（clock）；可有架子，但不可有瓦罐（crock），可有钥匙，但不可有锁（lock）；可有墙壁，但不可有门（door）；可有地毯，但不可有地板（floor）；可有窗框，但不可有窗户（window）；可有烟囱，但不可有安烟囱的屋顶（floor）；可有餐刀，但不可有叉子（fork）或羹匙（spoon）；可有床，但不可有枕头（pillow）。我们没有木柴（wood）生火；没有灯油（oil）点灯；也没有铁架（hob）来烧水。”

“他们会拿走我的生面团（dough）。”面包师傅悲叹道。

“他们会拿走我的金子（gold）。”金匠悲叹道。

“还有我的打铁炉（forge）。”铁匠叹道。

“还有我的布匹（cloth）。”裁缝哭泣道。

“还有我的巧克力（chocolate）。”糖果师傅咕哝道。

听到这话，一个名叫海德的人站起来，开口道：“巧克力对胃有害，”他说，“我们还会有冬青糖和薄荷糖。向布莱克和小杰克致敬，他们会把我们大家从甘草糖（licorice）和苦薄荷糖（horehound）中解放出来！”

“海德是律师，”安德雷乌斯指出，“他还会有规费和罚款。”

“还有他的鹅毛笔和墨水。”面包师说。

“还有他的文件和羊皮纸。”金匠说。

“还有他的椅子和桌子。”铁匠说。

“还有他的签字盖章。”裁缝说。

“还有他的诉讼状和留置权。”糖果师说。

但是，律师对这一切置之不理，流利地说道：“我们大家都同样缺乏机会，都同样一无所有。一定有宝石，否则布莱克和小杰克不会大老远跑来寻找。我建议我们亲自在角角落落、旮旮旯旯寻找。”有些人同意海德的看法，但大部分人都站在诗人一边。

“我们必须想法拯救我们的家。”诗人说。他们坐在地上，绞尽脑汁想办法，直到月亮落下。即使在他们思考的时候，布莱克、小杰克和他们的人都在忙着剖开娃娃（doll）、黄槌球（yellow croquet ball）和椰子（coconut），但他们发现的只是你在娃娃、黄槌球和椰子里总是找到的那些东西。

第二天早晨，安德雷乌斯正在大街上遛他的狮子狗。为了搜寻宝石，这条石子路已被挖开，这时他遇到了布莱克和小杰克。

“你们现在都是宠物（pet），”小杰克冷笑道，“因为诗人（poet）里面已经没了O。另外，扬抑格（trochee）、诗节（strophe）、扬扬格（spondee）、颂诗（ode）、十四行诗（sonnet）和回旋诗（rondeau）也都没有了。”

狮子狗嗥叫起来。

“我讨厌狮子狗，”布莱克吼道，“因为狮子狗（poodle）里有两个O。”

“我的宠物是法国的，”安德雷乌斯说。“他不仅是chien，这是法语里的‘狗’（dog），而且是caniche，这是法语里的‘狮子狗’。”

“Chien caniche，”鹦鹉粗声叫道，“Chien caniche。”

“那我要除掉其他带O的家畜。”布莱克喊道，然后为此下达了一道法令。

这在岛上引起了极大的恐慌，因为人们可以有猪，但不能有肉猪（hog）、猪肉（pork）、熏猪肉（bacon）；可以有羊，但不能有羊肉（mutton）和羊毛（wool）；可以有小牛，但不能有奶牛（cow）。只要其中没有一只离群，变成一只鹅（goose），鹅群（geese）就是安全的。要是鼠群（mice）中有一个离开鼠窝，就会变成一只鼠（mouse），失去豁免权。孩子们失去了他们的小马（pony），农夫们失去了他们的马驹（colt）、马匹（horse）、山羊（goat）、驴（donkey）和公牛（ox）。

测试案例不断诉诸法庭（court）——或去庭（curt），人们就是这样叫的。“必须得有人为大家阐明法律，否则谁也不知道谁的立场。”人们说。因此，布莱克指派海德为律师、法官和首席阐释官。“解释得越乱越好，”布莱克说，“记住我是多么讨厌那个字母。”

这正对海德阴暗狡诈的路子。“混乱（chaotic）现在成了昆乱（chatic），”他说，“是混乱（chaos）和静态（static）杂交。”他判决，要是农夫们成群养奶牛，就能保留他们的奶牛，因为成群奶牛就是雌牛（kine）或牛群（cattle）。这样，人们就会有牛奶、奶酪和黄油了。他判决，要是母鸡被隔离，就有利于母鸡和鸡蛋。“要让它们离开鸡群（flock），”他说，“因为鸡群不仅是鸡群，而且也是家禽（poultry）。”

“我们没有了玉米（corn）、土豆（potato）、花椰菜（cauliflower）和西红柿（tomato）。”一天，一个家庭主妇说。

“在菜园里，”海德说，“生长的东西百分之九十五都不带O。我可以给你说出二十种这样的东西。”他逞能地补充说，“随后，你们会异口同声地嚷嚷说西蓝花（broccoli）。几乎所有的水果都是你们能吃的，从苹果到柑橘，中间足有两打。我要坚持念出那些以P开头的，让你们听听我是什么意思：梨子（pear）、桃子（peach）、李子（plum）、梅干（prune）、芭蕉（plaintain）、菠萝（pineapple）、万寿果（pawpaw）、番木瓜（papaya）。但是，你们会渴望那些你们从来不吃、无法忍受的东西——我了解你们女人——比如，石榴（pomegranate）和乏味的柿子（persimmon）。顺便说一下，没有葡萄柚（grapefruit）。我讨厌它的苦汁。我已经借它的法文名字pamplemousse明令禁止了它。”

有一天，又一个主妇去法庭抱怨她没有了的东西。“丁香（clove）和桂皮（cinnamon）。”她说，“牛至（marjoram）和藏红花（saffron）。”

“你还有莳萝，”海德说，“百里香、鼠尾草、罗勒，还有醋、香子兰和菝葜，还有盐、胡椒和红辣椒粉，还有姜和调料。你不能喝咖啡（coffee），但还有茶；想让它变甜，还有糖。”

一名女裁缝举起手，询问纺织品、纤维织物和衣服里的O。“有些东西你不能拥有，”海德承认说，“比如，灯芯绒（corduroy）和斜纹绸（bombazine），蝉翼纱（organdy）和针织细绸（tricotine），印花棉布（calico）和硬衬布（crinoline）。但是，你还有丝绸和缎子，天鹅绒、蕾丝和亚麻布，薄纱、斜纹布和粗花呢，锦缎和牛仔布，马德拉斯棉布和平纹细布，毛毡、印花棉布、台面呢和皮革，还有二十种料子可以在凉爽、温暖和严寒天气穿。”

话说船上的水手长是一个名叫斯特兰格的人，舵手是一个名叫斯特拉格的人，前者对玫瑰（rose）过敏，后者对福禄考花（phlox）过敏。所以，布莱克认定，就连名字里带O的鲜花也跟他作对。他命令船员们拔掉岛上花园里的玫瑰和福禄考花，还有夹竹桃（oleander）、月光花（moonflower）、牵牛花（morning-glory）、大波斯菊（cosmos）、鸡冠花（coxcomb）和耧斗菜（columbine），以及其他所有带O的鲜花。

“但是，我是靠种紫罗兰（violet）、蜀葵（hollyhock）和万寿菊（marigold）糊口的。”一个园丁抱怨说。

“种百合谋生很好，”海德说，“还有许多和百合（lily）押头韵的鲜花。比方说丁香（lilac），等等。我自己杂交培育了一些品种，成功的多失败的少。勿忘我（Forget-me-not）跟庭荠（madwort）杂交后，就会失去它们的O。我培育了一种杂交植物，命名为永悔我（regret-me-evers）。黑种草（Love-in-a-mist）和荷包牡丹（bleeding heart）杂交，结果成了情侣吵（sweethearts' quarrel）。”

“这是亵渎神明或异端邪说什么的！”女人们叫道。

“你还没有听到其中的一半。”海德说。“金光菊（black-eyed susan）和千穗谷（ragged sailor）杂交，我培育出了破衣苏珊（ragged susan）。天南星（Jack-in-the-pulpit）和山柳菊（devil's paintbrush）杂交，就应该给我出来圣坛魔鬼（devil-in-the-pulpit）。想一下用藜芦（hellebore）和风铃草（Canterbury bell）杂交，会出现多么美妙的邪恶钟声（指 hell bell，来自地狱的钟声）。”听到这话，女人们愤怒而沮丧地站起来，离开了去庭，没有行屈膝礼。

“为什么不除掉所有的鲜花？”有一天，布莱克问道，“毕竟，鲜花（flower）里有一个O。”

“这我想过了。”海德说，“但我们必须放过集合名词，比如食物（food）、财产（good）、农作物（crop）、工具（tool），还有我应该考虑低级学校（school）。我已经夺走了木工的圆凿（gouge）和木板（board）。尽管还给他留有太多太多，但带O和不带O就是这样进行的。他有锯子、大斧头和短柄小斧，有锤子、凿子，有手摇曲柄钻，有刨子和水平仪，还有钉子、大头钉、角钉、螺丝钉和订书钉。但是，他能造的所有东西就是小摆设、小玩意、便宜货、廉价首饰、花哨东西。没有栏舍（coop）或羊圈（goathouse），没有门廊（stoop）或船库（boathouse）。”

“我希望我能消除身体（body）；那样，我就会摆脱所有人（everybody）。”布莱克的眼睛像红宝石一样闪光，“不再有解剖学（anatomy），不再有形态学（morphology）、面相学（physiognomy）和生理学（physiology），也不再有整体的人（people）——甚或个体的人（person）了。我常常夜里想到这一点。身体是血液（blood），是骨头（bone），是其他带O的词，是器官（organ）、躯干（torso）、腹部（abdomen）和脚趾（toe）。”

海德翘了翘上嘴唇，说道：“我会用带A、I、U、E的词给你造一个更好的人，他会有更加坚实的肉体，从长有毛发的脑袋到带有跖骨的双脚，都完完全全，有肌肉发达的胳膊和柔韧灵活的膝盖；有眼睛、耳朵、眼皮、嘴唇、脖子、胸腔、胸部和臀部；有肝脏、心脏、肺部和下巴；有神经、韧带和皮肤；有肾脏、胰腺、两肋、脚踝、腿肚、胫骨和小腿；有大腿、睫毛、肋骨和脾脏——”布莱克变得有点儿脸色发青。于是，海德举起双手。“有脑子、静脉、细胞、腺体——”

“安静！”布莱克怒喝道。“我希望有更多的东西都带O。”

海德叹了口气，说道：“不是所有的东西都带O，我们改变不了这一点。”

“我不会夺走他们的声带（vocal cord）、舌头（tongue）或喉咙（throat），”布莱克说，“但我会让这些藏宝石的人说的任何词里都不用O。”

于是，当人们被迫用不带O的词说话的时候，语言文字和能说的词汇都渐渐变少消失。人们再也不能说“嗨嗬”（Heigh-Ho）、“哟吼”（Yoohoo）或“唷嗬嗬”（Yo ho ho），甚至简单的“哈啰”（Hello）也不能说了。镇子上的剧院关闭，因为莎士比亚的台词没有O，听上去平淡含混。当《奥赛罗》（Othello）变成《赛尔》（Thell）的时候，谁也表演不了《奥赛罗》，苔丝狄蒙娜（Desdemona）一开始就被扼杀。有些句子变得非常奇怪，听上去像是外语。“寸厌的食人麻向凶夕吉少的食人女麻送秋皮（Dius gre gling minus gress）”意思是“讨厌的食人魔向凶多吉少的食人女魔暗送秋波（Odious ogre ogling ominous ogress）”，但只有学者明白这一点。口语变成了一种咝咝咝、咕噜噜、喃喃喃和嗡嗡嗡的声音。一个名叫奥托·奥特（Otto Ott）的人，有人问他的名字的时候，他只能结结巴巴地说tttt了。奥菲莉娅·奥利弗（Ophelia Oliver）重复自己的名字，就从人们的思维中消失了。

“我们分不清是子弹（shot）还是射击（shoot），是火热（hot）还是枭叫（hoot）。”在跟他的伙伴们密会的时候，铁匠说。

“我们分不清是腐朽（rot）还是根部（root），是欠债（owed）还是结婚（wed）。”面包师说。

“甚至比这个更糟，”安德雷乌斯说，“常常（oft）变得跟英尺（foot）拼写一样，古怪（odd）和渡渡鸟（dodo）拼写一样。必须马上有所作为，否则我们将永远不知道我们在说什么。”他说得对。一些人把鼹鼠（mole）说成了沉思（mull），另一些人则称它们是爱慕迈尔（emmel）。《火烈鸟故事》（Flamingo Stories）一书的作者向他的妻子朗读《火列乌古事》（Flaming Stries）之后，放弃了写作。

“我还是会听到笑声，”有一天，布莱克对海德抱怨说，“我对他们做了所有一切之后，还会听到笑声。”

海德提醒他说道：“哈哈笑、微微笑、咧嘴笑或咯咯笑里没有O。当然，哈哈大笑（chortle）里有一个O，但轻笑或窃笑里没有。”

“不要跟我玩文字游戏！”布莱克咆哮着说。“游戏。”他重复道，咀嚼着这个词，好像是咀嚼着一颗糖似的。“夺走他们的溜溜球（Yo-yo）、小丑面具（diavolo）和多米诺骨牌（domino）；扔掉他们的铁圈（quoit）、羽毛球（shuttlecock）和玩槌球戏（croquet）的所有相关东西；沙弧球（shuffleboard）和击石游戏（crochinole）必须消失，还有邮局游戏（Post Office）、枕头游戏（Pillow）、井字游戏（ticktacktoe）、乒乓球（Ping-pong）——”

海德举起手，马上表示异议。“乒乓球是用不带O的球拍、球和网，在一张不带O的桌子上打。”

布莱克继续说出现在成为非法游戏的名字。“让他们弹塑料片游戏，”布莱克说，“玩掷飞刀游戏。”

海德招聘了十二个人，很快又招了十二个，帮助他们防止人们夜里在地下室玩这些游戏——跳蛙游戏（leapfrog）、跳房子游戏（hopscotch）和抢壁角游戏（Pussy Wants a Corner）。

“我们生活在种种危险之中，”安德雷乌斯告诉人们，“不久我们就会没有多少东西可说了。我们可以玩的已经很少了。我来念一段。它暗示了我们所处的窘境。”于是，他念道：

“它们是摇摆的昆乱（chas，应为chaos）。什么是吉实（slid，应为solid）？有什么尉藉（slace，应为solace）留下来？我们都北井离乡（begne，应为obegone）、秋眉苦脸（webegne，应为woebegone）。人生乏未（bring，应为boring）粗谷（brish，应为boorish）。即使学交孝育（schling，应为schooling）也非常愚春（flish，应为foolish）。动（z，应为zoo）里的动物们还没有我们小言（lacnic，应为laconic）。路上都是丧音（vice，应为voice），土交（scial intercurse，应为social intercourse）浇柔告作（baths，bathos）。让我们聚起师子一样的甬气（gird up ur lin，应为gird up our lions），艮除巩具（rt the hrrr，应为root the horror），区逐白知（ust the af，应为oust the oaf）！”

“这是什么别扭腔？”铁匠嚷道。“这是什么乱七八糟的？”

安德雷乌斯说：“是不带O的英语。”随后，他加上所有的一个O和两个O又念了一遍。许多人已经猜到webegne 是woebegone，但没有人能说出begne是背井离乡（obegone）。

“我们怎么会驱散这愚春（flishness，应为foolishness）的噩梦？”面包师问道，他不能把的（of）省掉。

“答案一定是，”安德雷乌斯说，“在已经写好的书里。我建议我们大家都去读一下图书馆的藏书，寻找这个秘密，找到一个能让布莱克和小杰克完蛋的方案和法术。”

那天夜里，树林里黑黢黢的。所以，安德雷乌斯和他的伙伴们没发现海德藏在树后面听他们的计划。他的同事们和同胞们已经禁止他参与法庭辩论和会议。第二天早上，这个被剥夺权利的律师去找布莱克，把自己听到的一切告诉了他。

“毁掉所有可能有用的书籍（book），”布莱克命令道，“尤其是那些名字里有O的学术书和科学书；有地理学（geography）、传记学（biography）、生物学（biology）、心理学（psychology）、哲学（philosophy）、语文学（philology）、天文学（astronomy）、农学（agronomy）、美食学（gastronomy）；有三角学（trigonometry）、几何学（geometry）、视光学（optometry），以及所有其他这学那学（ologies and onomies and ometries）。”

船员们热情地开始了他们的新任务。还没等结束，他们就已经拆毁了学院（college），销毁了许多书籍（book）、巨著（tome）和书卷（volume），销毁了许多地球仪（globe）、黑板（blackboard）和教鞭（pointer），驱逐了教授（professor）、助理教授、学者（scholar）、导师（tutor）和讲师（instructor）。没有人留下来把英语译成英语。婴儿说的话常常跟他们的父亲的话一样容易理解。

岛上有一个名叫安德莉娅的美丽少女。一天夜里，她在父亲的书房里寻找那个秘密，寻找那个能挫败那些坏蛋并最终摆脱他们的法术的时候，发现了一本魔法古书。第二天夜里，安德莉娅就带着那本书去了树林里的密会地点。安德雷乌斯胆战心惊，因为不允许女人们参加集会。诗人之所以担心女人会被驱逐出岛，是因为女人们（women）和一个女人（woman）里都有O。

“他们也（too）会驱逐母亲（mother）。”安德雷乌斯说，忘记了不用带O的词说话。

“少女是安全的，”安德莉娅指出，“作为小姑娘、女孩、闺女、处女和老处女，都一样。”

“还有作为宝贝和爱人也安全。”安德雷乌斯说，“但你还是一个女人。”

“我可以变成新娘和妻子，”安德莉娅说，“新娘和妻子不仅仅是女人。”

“然后，你会成为已婚妇人（matron），”安德雷乌斯说，“没有希望拥有宝宝（tot）、幼儿（toddler）、小男孩（boy）或娃娃（moppet）。”

“受够了这样唠唠叨叨、喋喋不休，”车匠抱怨说。“我造的车轮没有辐条（spoke），没有辐条的车轮就像没有O的词一样。”

“我做的蜡烛没有油脂（tallow），”蜡烛工抱怨说，“没有油脂的蜡烛不是蜡烛。”

“不要害怕用带O的词说话，”安德莉娅最后说道，“没有希望（hope），我们就无法生活或说话。没有O的希望一无是处。即使一无是处（nothing），要是没有了O，便更加一无是处了。希望包含所有一切中最意味深长的O。我们不能失去它。”于是，她把那本从她父亲的书房找到的书送给了安德雷乌斯。

“书名叫《魔法城堡》（The Enchanted Castle）。”安德雷乌斯说。

“我知道这本书。”一位白胡子老人颤声说道，“我还能告诉你们它说的是什么，以免你们浪费时间，也省得你们朗读词里不带O的书。”

“那告诉我们它说的是什么，”安德雷乌斯说，“因为书里充满了脚注（footnote），现在称为却主（ftnte）。”

老人清了清嗓子，开口说话。“听着，我的孩子们，你们会听到一个魔法城堡会在今年今天晚上起一个月后出现。”于是，他就讲了这个魔法城堡的故事，其他人都默默地听着。“一千年前，这个岛上曾有一位国王，但他被一伙坏蛋从城堡里赶走了，那伙坏蛋就像现在这伙折磨我们的坏蛋一样。他们拆毁了城堡，一块石头一块石头地寻找宝石和藏宝图，可根本没有什么宝藏，或者说，即使有，也找不到。国王被驱逐出岛，但他离开的时候，在城堡曾经矗立的地上下了一个奇妙的咒语。”老人停下来，挠了挠头。

“这个咒语怎么说？”安德雷乌斯问道。

“也许这个少女记得。我的记性不再像从前了。”老人说。

“每过几百年，城堡将会再次出现，”安德莉娅说，“从外观上就像孩子们梦中见到的魔法城堡。”

“那谁会进入那里呢？”安德雷乌斯问道，“又是为什么呢？”

安德莉娅举起双手，又让它们放了下来。“书的最后一页遗失了。”她说。

“书的最后一页绘有一张地图，”老人喃喃说道，“我的记性不像从前了，但我记得这一点。”他默默地站了一会儿，然后接着说道：“无论是谁找到那张地图，都会在每件打开的东西里发现一块宝石。我的记性不像从前了，但我记得这一点。”

“这张地图在哪里？”安德雷乌斯问道，“你能想起来吗？”

老人想啊想，然后才开口说话：“我好像记得，是在一面墙上，是城堡里的一面旧墙。无论是谁找到地图，都会找到一种宝石，没有宝石，人们就会迷路。”

“那么，当城堡再次出现的时候，我们要首先赶到。”安德雷乌斯嚷道。

老人神情忧郁地摇了摇头，说道：“只有恶人才能进入那里，国王的咒语就是这样说的。我不知道为什么，就是我曾经知道，也早已忘记了。”

“此刻我们迷路了。”安德雷乌斯说。

“当迷失（lost）已经失去O的时候，我们是不可能迷失的，”老人说，“我们可能会吗？”

于是，其他人转过了脸，唯恐他们把厄运降临的表情流露在脸上。老人又开口说：“我好像听到一种新奇的钟声，一种古老而熟悉的钟声，一种我以前从未听过的钟声，一种我记得的钟声。”

其他人都转向他，目不转睛地看。在沮丧中，安德雷乌斯低声说道：“是胜利的钟声，还是丧钟声？”

“时间，”老人叹道，“会分辨出来的。”

第二天，那些坏蛋攻进了圆顶阁（cupola），砸开了飞檐（cornice）和基石（cornerstone），把滴水兽嘴（gargoyle）砸成了碎片，毁坏了爱奥尼亚式（Ionic）、多立克式（Doric）、哥特式（Gothic）和科林斯式（Corintian）的大理石柱（Column），以及巴洛克式（baroque）和洛可可式（rococo）的一切东西。在一条凉爽、幽静的走廊里，布莱克亲自挥斧砸碎了荷马（Homer）和贺拉斯（Horace）和柏拉图（Plato），奥维德（Ovid）和奥玛尔（Omar）和加图（Cato），第欧根尼（Diogenes）和达摩克利斯（Damocles），苏格拉底（Socrates）和希波克拉底（Hippocrates），狄摩西尼（Demosthenes）和阿里斯托芬（Aristophanes）的大理石胸像。碎石中没有一丝闪耀的光芒。

“为什么不打开墓穴（tomb）呢？”有一天，小杰克问道，“宝石经常藏在墓穴里。”

“墓穴在墓地里，”布莱克答道，“我已经决定对一些不带O的词采取极为尊重的态度。这就是我们不侵犯神殿、教堂和小礼拜堂的原因。”

“也许你有些惧怕那些鬼（ghost）和食尸鬼（ghoul），”小杰克说，“你知道，他们号哭（howl）带O，地精（goblin）和妖怪（hobgoblin）也带O。但是，鬼怪（spook）和幽灵（phantom）里也有O，我们碰不得。”

“我讨厌所有碰不得的东西。”布莱克哆嗦了一下，咕哝道。

“字母表已经接管了。”小杰克抱怨说，“法律的文字现在却成了文字的法律。”

“不管怎样，但我们还是不去搜寻不带O的地方，”布莱克说，“因此我没有碰丛林、沙漠、沼泽、荒野和荒地。此外，那里到处都是名字里带A、E、I、U的动物：有骆驼和大象，有土豚和鸭嘴兽，有牦牛、斑马和角马，有老虎和美洲虎，有黑豹、美洲狮和猞猁。我现在有些喜欢这种生物了。”

“我有些害怕带O的动物，”小杰克说，“我不知道为什么。”

“我碰巧知道这里没有带O的动物，”布莱克说，“我告诉你为什么。船员当中有一个名叫费尔奇的人。”

“是一个爱偷东西的家伙。”小杰克说。

“爱偷东西的家伙从我们制造的废墟里找到了一份古代文献。”布莱克说。

“这个文献怎么说？”小杰克问。

布莱克露出了下排牙齿。“上面说，古代有一位国王的侄女被鳄鱼（crocodile）咬伤了，国王就把沙漠、沼泽和丛林里所有带O的大型动物——鳄鱼、狮子（lion）、野猪（boar）、巨蟒（python）、眼镜蛇（cobra）、蟒蛇（boa）、大猩猩（gorilla）、长臂猿（gibbon）和狼（wolf）都赶了出去。猩猩（Orangutan）和狒狒（baboon）都销声匿迹了。箭猪（porcupine）、猫鼬（mongoose）、树懒（sloth）、野狗（dingo）、豹子（leopard）和树熊猴（potto）都被从它们栖息的树木、洞穴或石窟赶走了。”

“犀牛（rhinoceros）和河马（hippopotamus）呢？”小杰克问。

“跟水獭（otter）和袋鼠（kangaroo）一起荡然无存，”布莱克说，“这个岛上没有带O的生物留下，除了很少几种，它们不会困扰我们。”那天夜里，他坐在酒馆里时，又一次说道：“没有带O的动物困扰我们。”

一个酒吧女招待听到了他的话；下班后，她跟其他人一起参加了树林里的秘密集会，把布莱克说的话告诉了大家。而就在这时，海德出现在了他们中间，好像是从地下冒出来似的。“你们那些长着毛皮、鱼鳍和羽毛的带O的朋友，要么是被赶走，要么是完全灭绝，要么是根本没有！”他嚷道，“比方说什么恐龙（dinosaur）、雷龙（brontosaurus）、猛犸象（mammoth）、巨兽（behemoth）、古鱼龙（ichthyosaurus）和翼龙（pterodactyl），还有渡渡鸟（dodo）和乳齿象（mastodon）。”他转向安德雷乌斯，讽刺说：“其他带O的动物都是神话传说。你们为什么不号召它们来帮忙呢？”

“这些从来不存在的动物是什么？”老人问道，“你们知道，我的记性不像从前了。我发现很难想起不曾存在的东西。”

“独角兽（unicorn）、龙（dragon）和牛头怪（Minotaur），”海德说，“传奇和传说里的各种恶魔——狮鹫兽（griffon）、鸡身蛇尾怪（cockatrice）、凤凰（Phoenix）、蛇发女怪（Gorgon）、大鹏鸟（roc）、加拿大湖怪（ogo-pogo）和苏格兰湖怪（monster）。要是这十个还不够法定数（quorum），那就叫上小公鸡精（cockalorum）。”月亮已经躲到了一片云后面，人们感觉又冷又怕，好像不知何故，他们就已经失去了仅有的盟友。“那些带A、E、I和U的动物都站在布莱克和小杰克那边，”海德说，“它们全都在那里。当然，除非你们把在童话和幻想中找到的带O的生物也算进去——有托弗（tove）、傻瓜暴虎（mome rath）和保罗鹦鹉（borogove），有维芬普夫（whiffenpoof）、瓦格夫（wogglebug）、东（Dong），有波德（Pod）、托德尔（Todal）和戈姆（gorm）。”

“我从来没有听说过戈姆，”老人说，“也没有听说过托德尔。”

“这是因为它们从不存在，”海德说，“只存在于书里，在书里他们不是你们的朋友，而是敌人，其中每一个都已经失去了O。”他离开人群，消失在树林中。他走的时候，人们可以听到他嘲弄的笑声。

安德莉娅陷入了沉默，这时开口说话了，好像在背诵什么：“有四个带O的词，你们不能失去。找到它们是什么，学会使用。”

“希望（hope）是一个。”安德雷乌斯说。

“还有爱（love）。”安德莉娅说。

“我认为还有英勇（valor）。”老人说。随后，他们尽力想找出第四个词，说出了胆量（courage）、思想（thought）、道理（reason）、忠诚（devotion）、工作（work）和崇拜（worship）。

“一个也不对，”安德莉娅说，“一听，我就能听出来。”所以，直到月亮落下，他们都在试验带O的词——想象（imagination）和宗教（religion），奉献（dedication）和决定（decision），荣誉（honor）、后代（progeny）和愿景（vision）。“没有一个词是，”安德莉娅说，“一听，我就明白。”

“我希望，”老人说，“我们及时想出来。说不定这个词是智慧（wisdom）。”

“是一个严肃的词，”安德莉娅说，“但肯定不是最伟大的词。”后半夜他们都在寻找最伟大的词，尝试了青春（youth）、快乐（joy）和欢庆（jubilation），尝试了胜利（victory）、欣喜（exaltation），尝试了柔情（languor）、安慰（comfort）、放松（relaxation）、金钱（money）、幸运（fortune）、免税（non-taxation）、母性（motherhood）、家庭生活（domesticity），也尝试了许多hood和icity结尾的词。但是，安德莉娅对人们说的每个词都摇了摇可爱的脑袋，拒绝了灵魂（soul）和沉思（contemplation），驳回了求爱（courtship）和欢欣（elation），以及许多ship和ation结尾的词。

老人说：“我在信仰、真理和美里没发现O。唉，O属于失去（lost）和消亡（gone），属于遗弃（forsaken）和遗忘（forgotten）。”其他人对这话感到绝望，但搜寻还在继续，这是男人们所有的希望和梦想。老人捋着胡子，说道：“荣耀的语言从此就消失了。(6)”

还有人说话时带O，其中一个是个造船工，一个热情（gusto）有力（force）的人。“你还是我的配偶（spouse），不是我的酉偶（spuse）。”他告诉恐惧的妻子说，“这是我的房子（house），不是我的方子（huse）；我造的是船（boat），不是丹（bat）；我穿的是外套（coat），不是外大（cat）。”他问最小的儿子：“你今天（today）在学校（school）学了什么？”

“是学交（schl）。”他的儿子回答。

“跟我说话绝对不要嘶嘶的。”他的父亲嚷道，“我想要芦荟（aloe）的时候，我不想要户荟（ale），我讨厌这些名字。浮雕宝石（cameo）就是浮雕宝石，不是浮雕玉石（came）。昨天我遇到了一个男人，他想要四只独木舟（four canoes）——”

“四口独木丹（fur canes）。”他的儿子插话说。

“安静！”他的父亲嚷道。“你今天在学校学了什么？”

“薄雾总是薄雾，但薄雾一样的东西并不总是薄雾。”他的儿子背诵道。

听到这话，他的父亲像风暴一般站起来，戴上帽子，穿上外大，然后阔步走到门（door）原来所在的地方，伸手去摸门把手（knob）曾在的地方。

“尔（yu，应为you）要云（ging，应为going）哪里？”他的妻子担忧地低声问道。

“出云（ut，应为out）！”造船工嚷道，然后就出云了。

“尔对尔的父亲说了什么，使他离开了方子？”母亲问儿子。

“薄雾（mist）总是潮湿（moist），”男孩低声答道，“但潮湿的东西并不总是薄雾。”

而且还发生了其他古怪的事儿。一位情郎称赞心上人的歌侯（thrat，应为throat），说她唱得像慌鹂（rile，应为oriole）合昌（chir，应为choir）或充满活力的合昌队（chrus，应为chorus），被扇了一个耳光。就这样，一些小伙子失去了他们的姑娘，大多数男人发起了脾气，所有男人都失去了耐心，还有少数几个人丧失了心智。

后来有一天，布莱克喊来海德磋商。“我路过时，有人向我致敬，”他咆哮着说，“你知道为什么吗？”

“在某些地区，现在O的缺失是一种狂热，”海德评论说，“尽管这是一种凌乱的缺失，但它的没有意义吸引了少数人，先是一两个，后来是三四个，再后来越来越多。人们经常会尊敬他们理解不了的东西，因为他们总是分不清磨难与祝福，也分不清桂冠与荆棘。这会在他们还能玩的游戏中呈现出来。猜字游戏与其说是娱乐，远不如说是工作，躲猫猫、捉迷藏和羊快跑也是这样。O的缺失现象可能会变成未来的一种主义，四面八方的人们、朝圣路上的朝圣者，都会将他们的供品摆在你的墓上。”

布莱克露出了牙齿，打了一个不安的手势，说道：“去掉一个字母，应该会使生活更加简单。”

“我不明白为什么。从生活（life）里拿走f，你就会得到谎言（lie）。在简单（simple）这个词上加一个字母，就会变成更简单（simpler）。从宝库（hoarder）里去掉一个字母，就会变成更难（harder）。”海德微微耸了耸肩，恶意地瞥了一眼，就转身走开了。

布莱克望着他离去，脸色阴沉。“他太精明了，”他大声说道，“对他自己、对我都没有好处。”





6


没有钟表（clock）标记流逝的时间，因为布莱克已经砸烂了所有的钟表。现在是十月（October），但没有人知道今天是星期几，因为布莱克把带O的月份——十月和十一月（November）——从所有的日历上都撕了下来。剩下的依然挺立、没有被破坏、没有被劫掠的东西寥寥无几；失去塔（tower）的镇子，没有喷泉（fountain）和水池（pool）的乡村，失去橡树（oak）和铁杉（hemlock）的林子，好像都荒芜了。知更鸟（robin）和黄鹂（oriole）已经飞走了，就连北美夜鹰（whippoorwill）也不再歌唱了。随后，老人曾经预测的那个夜晚来临了。

布莱克和小杰克坐在酒馆里的桌边，这时他们听到一阵嘈杂声和孩子们的喊叫声。名字里不带O的狗，猎兔犬、矮脚长耳猎犬和西班牙猎犬，发出了一阵悲哀的嗥叫。一种奇妙的光充满了整个天空。

“这是什么喧闹声？”布莱克问道。

“我不知道是什么，”小杰克说，“但我不喜欢这样。”

“我不喜欢这样，我不喜欢这样！”鹦鹉粗声叫道。布莱克握住它的喉咙，它就只能唧唧叫了。

“唧唧。”鹦鹉哼道。

因为地板（floor）消失了，所以布莱克和小杰克踩在土地上，大步走到曾是门（door）的地方，然后抬头盯着天空。只见一座巨大的城堡屹立在一英里外的小山上，好像被许多个月亮的光辉照亮一般。

“是城堡！”布莱克喊道。他搓着两只手套，贪婪地盯着。“是宝石！”他嚷道，“是绿宝石、红宝石和蓝宝石！”

“不要心急。”小杰克警告说。

“要快！”布莱克嚷道，随后匆匆穿过夜幕，跌跌撞撞地走在磨损的石子路上，闪亮的眼睛盯着闪亮的城堡。

“不要心急，”小杰克又警告说，“我闻到了阴谋诡计的气味。”

“我闻到了宝石的气味，”布莱克大声说道，“我闻到有一张地图。”

他们的船员带着斧头、铁锹和木棒，现在已经聚集在了他们的周围，像一群饥饿的猎狗一样叫喊着。他们在斯特兰格和斯特拉格的敦促下，都向城堡涌去。

安德雷乌斯和安德莉娅站在一根断柱的阴影里望着他们离去。“这是他们最疯狂的夜晚，我希望这是他们最后的夜晚。”安德雷乌斯喘息着说。

“继续说一下希望，”老人说，像是从什么地方冒出来似的，“因为我们需要它。”

“书里有一个脚注，”安德莉娅说，“我忘记提了。”

“它怎么说？”安德雷乌斯问道。

“要是人们不能在明天中午之前找到他们心里渴望的东西，他们的目标就会消失。”

“这给了他们长达十二小时的时间，而且他们的人数肯定有一百个。”安德雷乌斯说。

老人说：“要是还年轻，我就能单枪匹马用一半时间找到地图。”

“地图不是他们的心愿，宝石才是，”安德莉娅说，“而且书里提到了有一片广阔无垠的沮丧森林。”

“那部分怎么样？”安德雷乌斯问道。

“它都是用带O的词写的，或者差不多都是，而且所有的O都消失了，”安德莉娅说。“当外套（coat）成了外大，船（boat）成了丹，牧羊人（goatherd）看起来像牛羊人，货摊（booth）成了货双（both），因为双方（both）成了又方（bth），所以读者的眼睛很受困扰（bothered）。”

“力量（power）也成了力里，零（zero）成了令，而且，最糟的是，英雄（hero）成了她（her）。”老人一边说，一边叹气。

“很快（Anon）成了艮快，悲叹（moan）成了男人（man）。”安德莉娅一边说，一边微笑。

“鞋子（shoe），”安德雷乌斯说，“成了她（she）。”

“啊，悲哀（woe），”老人说，“成了我们（we）。”

布莱克、小杰克、斯特兰格和斯特拉格，以及他们所有的人，像一群发疯的狒狒一样，分散开来，穿过城堡的每个角落，他们的叫喊声和喧闹声震得墙上的盾牌都在颤抖。“找到宝石或地图！”布莱克和小杰克喊道。“找到宝石或地图！”斯特兰格、斯特拉格和他们所有的人喊道。于是，他们把斧头和木棒挥向了每一把锁（lock）和每一扇门（door），砸破碗柜（cupboard），劈开衣柜（closet），撬开箱（box）盖，用铁锹敲烂钟表（clock）。几个小时过去了，叮当声越来越响。每一件带O的东西都被打开、搜查，并被拆开——沙发（sofa）、睡椅（couch）和垫脚软凳（ottoman），缟玛瑙（onyx）和锌青钢（ormolu）制品，象牙（ivory）和乌木（ebony），黄金（gold）和玉髓（chalcedony），瓦罐（crock）和碗（bowl），枕头（pillow）、靠垫（cushion）和脚凳（footstool），甚至还包括酒壶（flagon）和高脚杯（goblet）。人们喝了瓶子里的葡萄酒——白葡萄酒、红葡萄酒和玫瑰葡萄酒，然后摔碎瓶子（bottle）。他们撬开了板墙（board）和大理石地板（floor），但没有露出宝石，没有任何地图，没有闪光、闪烁或闪耀的东西，没有看到羊皮纸。

月亮落下了；太阳开始爬上了天空。喧闹声和叮当声停止了。所有能被破坏的东西都已被破坏了。玻璃和又薄又尖的木头碎片、零零碎碎的东西都躺在地板上或曾是地板的地方。这时，怒目而视的布莱克将戴着手套的手攥成拳头举向天空，就在那个时刻他看到了地图。它挂在唯一没有倒下的一面墙上。

“我之前没有看到这面墙。”布莱克嚷道。

“刚才它不在这里，”小杰克叫道，“我相信这一点。”

他们把地图从墙上拿下来，铺在一块厚木板上，俯身在地图上，最终破译出了上面所有的标记和叉号。

“宝藏距离这颗头颅狞笑的地方五千英尺，”布莱克大声说道，“我们先来找一棵受伤的橡树，再数五十步。”

“向北，东北！”小杰克喊道。

“宝石是我们的了，”布莱克得意地说，“我们成王公了！”

“是国王！”小杰克大声叫道。于是，斯特兰格、斯特拉格和他们所有的人一起随声附和道：“国王！”但是，没有声音再去随声附和他们了，因为所有的墙都消失了。只见他们的面前现在是一片黑黢黢、阴沉沉的森林，一直向远处延伸着。

“拿起铁锹！”布莱克命令道，“跟着我！”随后，每个人都抓住自己的铁锹，跟着布莱克、小杰克、斯特兰格和斯特拉格，走进了黑黢黢、阴沉沉的森林。

“什么时候了？”布莱克大声问道。

“差两个小时到中午（noon）。”小杰克说。

“我讨厌中午的发音，”布莱克说，“我不知道为什么。”

“可能是因为它有两个O。”斯特兰格说。

“可能是因为天会变热。”斯特拉格说。

“而且宝藏应该夜里挖。”小杰克说。

“安静，”布莱克怒喝道，“跟着我。这里的天气很怪。我讨厌这种天气。”

“为什么我们待在一起这么难？”小杰克问，甚至在他说话的时候，他就发现自己孤孤单单的。他呼喊，却没有回应。

“这边，”布莱克喊道，“所有人都跟着我。我感觉宝石在我的手里燃烧着。我有地图和指南针。找到那棵受伤的橡树！”他的声音在一阵咯咯声和呱呱声中戛然而止。随后，他的眼睛因恐惧而瞪大，手指颤抖，因为他像其他所有人一样独自站立。脚下的地面走起来泥泞缓慢，因为钻洞的鼹鼠已经吃掉了树根，软化了泥土。

“这里没有出口，也没有开口，”布莱克嚷道，“透湿得像沼泽一般。”

一百万只蛾在他的肩膀上空飞舞，不计其数的变色龙在暗淡的植株上变换着颜色。萤火虫四处发光，布莱克分不清他正向哪里走。随后，蝴蝶飞了过来。“蝴蝶（butterfly）不带O。”布莱克喊道，但他错了。黑脉金斑蝶（monarch）、黄缘蛱蝶（morning cloak）、黑缘豆粉蝶（clouded yellow），以及它们所有的伙伴聚集成了一大群。遮天蔽日，好像又到了夜晚。

“这个晦气的树林是怎么回事啊？”布莱克呜咽着说，没有人应声。

“这个晦气的树林是怎么回事啊？”小杰克声音嘶哑地说，独自迷失在森林的另一地方。四周黑暗深沉，像午夜似的。“这嗡嗡声来自哪里？”小杰克恸哭道。随后，他看到了不祥声音的来源：蝗虫（locust）、大黄蜂（hornet）、蜻蜓（dragonfly），还有赤翅蜂（yellowjacket）和蜜蜂（honeybee）。它们一片片、一群群、一队队地飞来。小杰克伤心地说：“当布莱克颁布法令的时候，他从来没有想到过小东西。”他一路摸索，慢慢地走进了一片古怪的小树林，但到了那里，他的路被生长的植物挡住了：有毒菌（toadstool）、蘑菇（mushroom）、附子花（monkshood）和血根草（bloodroot），有毛地黄（foxglove）、附子草（wolfbane）、乌头毒草（aconite），有兰花（orchid）、罂粟（opium poppy），还有曼陀罗草（mandragora）的根。铁兰（Spanish moss）垂下，丝兰（Spanish bayonet）飙长。“这些不幸的野草是怎么回事？”小杰克喃喃低语，野草现在蔓到了他的脚踝和膝盖上面，有美洲血根草（bloodwort）、拳参（dragonwort）、宽叶羊角芹（goutwort）、猪草（hogwort）、紫堇（holewort）、马先蒿（hoodwort）、虱子草（lousewort）、阴地蕨（moonwort）、马醉木（moorwort）、蝎子草（scorpionwort）、疗喉草（throatwort）、齿鳞草（toothwort）和水苏（woundwort）。

“这是什么晦气的树林啊？”海德长声尖叫道，独自迷失在森林的又一处地方。古怪的光闪光、闪烁又闪耀，使他眼花缭乱：有圣·艾默火球（St．Elmo's fire）(7)、狐火（foxfire）、鬼火（will-o'-the-wisp）、磷火（phosphorus），还有北极光（aurora borealis）。“这些是夜间的光，不是白天的，”海德抱怨说，“但我认为我几个小时前看到了黎明。”他抬头盯着天空，寻找着太阳。而老人星（Canopus）里冷冷的O低头凝视着他。南十字星座（Southern Cross）如手指一般用星星指着他。彗星（comet）和流星（meteor）像燃烧的箭一样闪耀，室女星座（Virgo）熊熊燃烧，摩羯座（Capricorn）、天蝎座（Scorpio）、大天狼星（Major Dogstar）、小天狼星（Minor Dogstar），还有许多其他星星和星座，海德数都数不清。

随后，灯光熄灭，黑暗再次来临。黑暗中开始了一场烟火表演：有落下各色气球的火箭（rocket）、罗马焰火筒（Roman candle）、花盆（flowerpot），还有黄金雨（golden shower）和银喷泉（silver fountain）。这时又出现了猫头鹰（owl）、乌鸦（crow）、潜鸟（loon）、丘鹬（woodcock），出现了苍鹭（heron）和火烈鸟（flamingo），出现了鸬鹚（cormorant）和秃鹰（condor），一只信天翁（albatross）羽毛里夹着石弩（crossbow）射出的箭（arrow），像轰炸机（bomber）一般向下俯冲（swooping and stooping）。他踉踉跄跄地向前走，穿过大枫树（sycamore）、铁杉（hemlock）、三角叶杨（cottonwood）、山核桃树（hickory）、洋槐（black locust）、皂荚树（honey locust）、橡树（oak）和巨型红杉（giant redwood），蚊子（mosquito）、细菌（microbe）和微生物（microorganism）泛滥成灾。脚下，在菘蓝（woad）里出没的青蛙（frog）和蟾蜍（toad）阻碍、阻挡、阻挠着他前进的步伐。“无能为力，无关痛痒，无关紧要。”他喃喃说道，还有所有其他律师都会说的四字成语。突然，一群天鹅飞扑向他。“反对！”海德恳求道，“天鹅没有带O。”随后，他想起了雄天鹅（cob）和雌天鹅（cos）带O。“对一些本名中没有O、别名中有O的生物感觉一塌糊涂。”海德大声说道，甚至在他说话的时候，一只猞猁（lynx）在他的脚边咆哮。“又名山猫（bobcat）。”海德呜咽着说。一头美洲狮（puma）露出了闪着寒光的獠牙。“又名山地狮（mountain lion）。”海德声音颤抖地说。“但这里有一头骆驼（camel）！我可以骑！”

“我是单峰驼（dromedary）。”骆驼说，或者像是要说，然后闭上一只眼睛，然后又睁开，走开了。

“不可衡量，不可捉摸，不大可能！”海德大声叫道。一只夜莺在他的眼前拍打着翅膀。“Je suis le rossignol。(8)”它唱道。

“绝无可能，”海德语无伦次地说，“无礼不公。”

三头熊出现了，用法律术语说，就是它们现身、出现和闪现。“熊在法语里是Les ours！”海德尖叫道。“而且，此外，也是：肉桂色熊（cinnamon）、北极熊（polar）和棕熊（brown）。”他单脚摇摇晃晃地跳了四下，摔倒在地。

突然，布莱克所在的那片黑暗森林里的道路变得更加清晰，太阳朗照。脚下的土地似乎更加坚实。那些阴森森的树木已经消失了，只留下了一棵受伤的橡树，耸立在一片林间空地上。随后，他看到了小杰克瘦长的轮廓，也看到了斯特兰格、斯特拉格和其他所有人。只见他们围住某个地方，用铁锹指着，尽管被叮咬得心烦意乱，但他们还在兴高采烈地尖叫着。

“就是这个地方！”小杰克嚷道。

“挖！”布莱克声音沙哑地说。人们准备用铁锹去挖，但当他们听到一阵不祥的喧闹声和叮当声、雪片般的飞箭声和盔甲声的时候，他们举起的手停住了。许多人影隐约出现，有步行的，有骑马的，他们在船员中间骑啊跑啊，船员们的铁锹掉了下来。

“这些只是幻觉中的人影，”布莱克嚷道，“这些人的血管里没有鲜血。”

“挖！”小杰克大声叫道，但没有人挖。他们站在那里，像生了根似的，盯着那些幽灵。

“他们的血管里流的是墨水，是不朽的墨水，是歌曲和故事的墨水。”这是安德雷乌斯的声音。

“墨水可能被毁灭，”布莱克喊道，“用墨水塑造的人也可能被毁灭。把他们的名字告诉我！”

人影从天空飞落而下，安德雷乌斯叫不出他们所有人的名字。他们从传说和传奇中、从歌曲和故事中小溪般流出来，每个幽灵都像旗帜一样迎风招展，各自炫耀独特的荣耀：有兰斯洛特（Lancelot）、艾凡赫（Ivanhoe）、阿多斯（Athos）、波尔托斯（Porthos）、西拉诺（Cyrano）、罗兰（Roland）、罗伯·罗伊（Rob Roy）、罗密欧（Romeo）；有伯南林的唐纳本（Donalbane of Birnam Wood）、鲁宾逊·克鲁索（Robinson Crusoe）和罗宾汉（Robin Hood）；有《洛娜·杜恩》中郁郁寡欢的杜恩（moody Doones of Lorna Doone）、戴维·克罗克特（Davy Crockett）和丹尼尔·布恩（Daniel Boone）；有出自近代和古代的书籍的——班柯的鬼魂（Banquo's ghost）和夏洛克·福尔摩斯（Sherlock Holmes）；有洛金伐尔（Lochinvar）、朗色若（Lothario）、霍雷肖（Horatio）；还有其他来自蔚蓝水域的更加阴郁的人物，莎士比亚的夏洛克（Shylock）、比利·邦斯（Billy Bones）、加西莫多（Quasimodo）、康拉德的琼斯（Jones）、伊卡博德（Ichabod）和胡克（Hook）船长——光这些名字就足以写满一本书。

“我认为，这些带O的人是消灭不了的。”小杰克恸哭道。

“书能烧掉。”布莱克声音沙哑地说。

“他们有办法从灰烬中复活。”安德雷乌斯说。

“我有一种糟糕透顶的感觉，好像厄运（doom）的两个O卡在了我的喉咙里。”尽管被噎住，但布莱克的声音变得更加愉快。“那些幽灵过去了，”他嚷道，“拿上你们的铁锹！”然而，好像这是一个信号或标记，空气中突然充满了笑声，其他人的影像骑着小马欢笑的印第安人一样，在骑扫帚的鹅妈妈（Mother Goose）带领下，开始在那些坏蛋的头顶和四周盘旋起来。

“这些噩梦和高烧的产物都是谁？”布莱克问道。

这次是安德莉娅的声音回答了他：“小杰克·霍纳从角落里走出来，有汤米·特劳特和他救出来的那只猫，有可怜的公鸡罗宾和贝西·布鲁克斯，有简单西蒙和汤米·斯努克斯，有福斯特医生从格洛斯特回到家来，有小男孩布鲁，还有科尔国王，以及住在鞋里的某位老妇人。”(9)

“这些只不过是暗影而已，”布莱克声音颤抖地说，“我把O从英雄（hero）和笨蛋（fool）里拽走了！”

安德莉娅说：“可是，还没有从爱（love）和喜爱（affection），从记忆（memory）和回忆（recollection）中拽走O。”

“拿起你们的铁锹！”布莱克一边命令，一边大笑，好让他的手下们大笑，但没有人笑出来。随后，其他的暗影雷电般从天而降：阿尔戈英雄（Argonaut）、密尔米顿（Myrmidon）和亚马逊人（Amazon），阿多尼斯（Adonis）和恩底弥翁（Endymion），阿波罗（Apollo）、许珀里翁（Hyperion），在他们的头顶高处，波乐克斯（Pollux）和他的兄弟卡斯托耳（Castor）更快地飞过，像桅杆里的一团火焰似的燃烧，像繁星一样点亮了天空。(10)

随后，那些带O的巨人来了：考莫兰（Cormoran）、布朗德鲍（Blunderbore）、歌利亚（Goliath），还有一百多个巨人，有向诺曼扔山峰的独眼巨人，甚至还有令人憎恶的喜马拉雅雪人。

人们现在趴在地上，所有的眼睛都闭着，不敢看天空的景象。

“挖，”布莱克声音沙哑地说，“否则我就杀了你们！”他从腰带上拔出了手枪，小杰克抽出了弯刀。因为害怕死亡远超过害怕幽灵，所以人们开始挖了起来。正当他们挖的时候，一座钟表敲响了，是一座看不见的钟表。地面突然又硬又冷，铁锹的刃弯曲折断。“你们碰到了一个箱子，”布莱克喊道，“是一个包铁的橡木箱子。”不过，人们碰到的是碳酸盐岩（carbonate）和金刚砂（carborundum），是砾岩（conglomerate）或圆砾岩（puddingstone），还有一些被称为鱼卵石（oolite）或铁石结核（dogger）的东西。钟表继续敲响。“我毁掉了所有的钟表。”布莱克嚷道。

“所有的钟表，只有一座除外，”安德雷乌斯说，“那是一座敲响在良心（conscience）上的钟表。”钟表深沉的声调继续响着，直到敲完了十一下。敲完这一下，一种奇特的现象发生了。地面上和四周出现了二十件东西，每件东西都不一样。

“容器（container）！”布莱克的声音空洞，“我本来应该毁掉这些容器，以及装在里面的东西。诅咒海德和他的那些集合名词！”

“我不知道里面是一些什么东西，但里面没有一件带O的东西。”小杰克盯着这些奇特的东西，声音单调：有储物箱、行李箱、小提箱，有各种盒子，有木桶、袋子、垃圾箱，还有各种花瓶。

“麻袋、木桶和篮子，”布莱克说，“板条箱、瓮，甚至还有奁。”他的眼睛变得暗淡，然后又燃起了一种凶光。“珠宝！”他喊道，“宝石！”

布莱克和小杰克，斯特兰格和斯特拉格，以及他们所有的人都开始打开那些不带O的容器。在每只容器里面，他们只发现了一张纸。每张纸上都出现一个词，那个词闪光、闪烁又闪耀。钟表敲响了十二下。

“中午了．”布莱克喊道，所有人都重复道：“中午！”

随后，他们听到了一声遥远的钟鸣，声音越来越近，越来越清晰，直到整个天空充满了魔法般的乐声。

“自由（freedom）！”安德雷乌斯叫道，说出了人们找到的那个闪光的词，那个熠熠生辉的词。

“自由！”安德莉娅跟着他叫道，这个最伟大的词的声音使那些坏蛋脸色发白、浑身发抖。

“我早就知道这个词不可能是世界末日（doom），”老人说，“也不可能是悲伤（sorrow）。我还担心可能是明天（tomorrow）呢。”

接下来，随着一个奇迹般的动作，那些坏蛋站在了海岸上，所有的岛民都围站在他们的四周。“你的时刻已经敲响了，”安德雷乌斯说，“这是你的船。走吧。”

“舷梯和甲板上黏滑（oozy），到处都是牡蛎（oyster），”布莱克嚷道，“还有葡萄牙产僧帽水母（Portuguese men-of-war）、龙虾（lobster）和一条章鱼（octopus）。剑鱼（swordfish）在船的吃水线下面，在一群极其讨厌、哈哈大笑的鼠海豚（a horrid school of chortling porpoises）的驱使下，正在锯什么东西（something）！”

千变万化的幻景突然漫过了海德的脚踝。“螃蟹、淡水龙虾、对虾、小虾，”他狂喊着说，“别名十足类动物（decapod）。蜈蚣和蜘蛛，别名节肢动物（arthropod）。蜗牛和蛞蝓，别名软体动物（mollusk）和腹足动物（gastropod）。”他认为他还看到了蟋蟀，别名直翅目（orthoptera），还有二十只嗡嗡飞动的蝙蝠，别名翼手目（chiroptera）。他转身奔跑，被大大小小的啮齿动物（rodent）追赶，其中包括老鼠、兔子和天竺鼠。

那座看不见的钟表敲响了一下。“那只老鼠正在跑下钟表。我看见它跑了。”小杰克说。当所有船员爬上船，沮丧地升起帆，慢慢地驶向大海的时候，他们都看见了一些以前不存在的东西。紧接着，在远处的地平线那边，伟大的O风暴开始狂暴咆哮，有飓风[包括康妮（Connie）、多萝西（Dorothy）和弗洛拉（Flora），有伊莫金（Imogene）、约瑟芬（Josephine）和诺拉（Nora）]，有台风（typhoon）和季风（monsoon），有旋风（cyclone）和龙卷风（tornado），有大暴雨（cloudburst）、水龙卷（waterspout），有雾（fog）和雪（snow），有涡流（whirlpool）和大漩涡（maelstrom），还有其他奇特的气象，每一种都带有O。夜晚来临，在闪电的光亮中，岸上那些人看见了或自以为看见了，巨大的猎户星座（Orion）的头部冉冉升出了海面。岸上还有人看见了或自认为看见了——伟大的探险者们的复仇之船：哥伦布（Columbus）、德·索托（De Soto）、科尔特斯（Cortez）和巴尔博亚（Balboa），以及从伊阿宋（Jason）和诺亚（Noah）以来其他所有探险者的船。

没有再听到过布莱克、小杰克、斯特兰格、斯特拉格或他们所有其他人的消息。有一天，一条折断的圆木和一只黑手套被冲上了岸，但仅此而已。不合法的律师海德正在寻找法律的漏洞（loophole），希望能借以逃脱，但其中一个漏洞的O崩溃了，把他埋在了残骸下面。他倒下的时候，又听到了O的声音，这是一只老猫头鹰（old owl）在苔藓覆盖（mossy）的橡树（oak）上发出的，有点儿像双簧管伴奏（oboe obbligato）。





10


岛上人带着勇气（valor）、爱（love）和希望（hope），把O放回到了已经失去它的所有一切当中。金凤花姑娘（Goldilocks）又恢复了笑声，钥匙又有了锁（lock），鞋子（shoe）也不再是她（she）了。某对夫妇又一次用曼陀林（mandolin）和钟琴（glockenspiel）演奏起了他们喜爱的二重奏。从人们的思维中消失的奥菲莉娅·奥利弗（Ophelia Oliver）回来了，又带有了两个O。奥托奥·奥特（Otto Ott）可以不用结结巴巴地说自己的名字了，尊严回归人类语言和英语语法。人类又一次可以对鹅（goose）发出嘘声（boo）了，也可以分辨to lose（要失去）和too loose（太宽松）了。每个家庭又有屋顶（roof）和地板（floor）了，一家之长也可以像以前那样用英语说“某个人（someone）去把门打开（open）或关上（close）”了。塔楼（tower）再次耸起，喷泉（fountain）波光粼粼。春天里，知更鸟（robin）和黄鹂（oriole）飞回来了。乌鸦（crow）在核心会议上高声喧哗，北美夜鹰（whippoorwill）晚间又一次侃侃而谈起来。布莱克和小杰克造成的创伤被牵牛花（morning-glory）、耧斗菜（columbine）、三叶草（clover）和被子（comforter）一样铺开的番红花（crocus）治愈了。一个四月的早晨，安德雷乌斯和安德莉娅结成了夫妻。

“本来可能更糟，”老人参加完婚礼，乘车回到家的时候说，“他们说不定会拿走A。那样的话，我们就不会有婚姻（marriage），甚至不会有马车（carriage），也不会有任何步行的小路（walk）。”他擦去了眼里的一滴泪。当他在花园里偶然遇见那对情人的时候，他正担心失去I，如果I被禁用了会怎样呢？“没有了不可分离（indivisibility），将会发生什么呢？”他问他们俩。

“或者，要是那样的话，”安德雷乌斯说，“还会失去不可战胜（invincible）吗？”

“Invincible这个词，”老人说，“是跟O一类的问题。”

“什么O？”安德雷乌斯和安德莉娅一起问道。

“自由中的O，以免我们忘记。”老人说。

突然，他们若有所思的寂静变成了朗朗笑声。“握住它的喉咙！”他们听到鹦鹉粗声叫唤。

“它一定是没有赶上轮船。”安德莉娅说。

“现在它有了尖叫的自由。”安德雷乌斯说。

随后，他们把绿鹦鹉带进了小屋，最后它又尖叫了起来。“注意大海！”每当听到这个警告和警报，岛上人就跳到城墙上和塔上，仔细察看海上挂有凶帆的恶船。

许多年过去了。后来有一天，一位长白胡子的老人站在高耸的大理石基座边，基座上是一个耸入天际的字母，这个字母在每一束光线和各种天气里都闪光、闪烁又闪耀。

“多么奇怪的雕像。”一个小男孩嚷道，“圆圈的雕像。”

“多么奇怪的纪念碑。”一个小女孩笑道，“零的纪念碑。”

老人叹了口气，挠了挠头，想啊想，然后说道：“它有一段奇特又奇妙的历史。”

“是一场战斗吗？我们赢了吗？”孩子们大声问道。

老人摇了摇头，叹息道：“我不像以前那样年轻了，过去的岁月是一个不解之谜，但那是一场大捷。”

太阳落下，金色的余晖像火一样照亮了神奇的O。

The Wonderful O





Many Moons


Once upon a time，in a kingdom by the sea，there lived a little Princess named Lenore．She was ten years old，going on eleven．One day Lenore fell ill of a surfeit of raspberry tarts and took to her bed．

The Royal Physician came to see her and took her temperature and felt her pulse and made her stick out her tongue．The Royal Physician was worried．He sent for the King，Lenore's father，and the King came to see her．

“I will get you anything your heart desires，”the King said．“Is there anything your heart desires？”

“Yes，”said the Princess．“I want the moon．If I can have the moon，I will be well again．”

Now the King had a great many wise men who always got for him anything he wanted，so he told his daughter that she could have the moon．Then he went to the throne room and pulled a bell cord，three long pulls and a short pull，and presently the Lord High Chamberlain came into the room．

The Lord High Chamberlain was a large，fat man who wore thick glasses which made his eyes seem twice as big as they really were．This made the Lord High Chamberlain seem twice as wise as he really was．

“I want you to get the moon，”said the King．“The Princess Lenore wants the moon．If she can have the moon，she will get well again．”

“The moon？”exclaimed the Lord High Chamberlain，his eyes widening．This made him look four times as wise as he really was．

“Yes，the moon，”said the King．“M-o-o-n，moon．Get it tonight，tomorrow at the latest．”

The Lord High Chamberlain wiped his forehead with a handkerchief and then blew his nose loudly．“I have got a great many things for you in my time，your Majesty，”he said．“It just happens that I have with me a list of the things I have got for you in my time．”He pulled a long scroll of parchment out of his pocket．

“Let me see，now．”He glanced at the list，frowning．“I have got ivory，apes，and peacocks，rubies，opals，and emeralds，black orchids，pink elephants，and blue poodles，gold bugs，scarabs，and flies in amber，hummingbirds' tongues，angels' feathers，and unicorns' horns，giants，midgets，and mermaids，frankincense，ambergris，and myrrh，troubadours，minstrels，and dancing women，a pound of butter，two dozen eggs，and a sack of sugar—sorry，my wife wrote that in there．”

“I don't remember any blue poodles，”said the King．

“It says blue poodles right here on the list，and they are checked off with a little check mark，”said the Lord High Chamberlain．“So there must have been blue poodles．You just forget．”

“Never mind the blue poodles，”said the King．“What I want now is the moon．”

“I have sent as far as Samarkand and Araby and Zanzibar to get things for you，your Majesty，”said the Lord High Chamberlain．“But the moon is out of the question．It is 35,000 miles away and it is bigger than the room the Princess lies in．Furthermore，it is made of molten copper．I cannot get the moon for you．Blue poodles，yes；the moon，no．”

The King flew into a rage and told the Lord High Chamberlain to leave the room and to send the Royal Wizard to the throne room．

The Royal Wizard was a little，thin man with a long face．He wore a high red peaked hat covered with silver stars，and a long blue robe covered with golden owls．His face grew very pale when the King told him that he wanted the moon for his little daughter，and that he expected the Royal Wizard to get it．

“I have worked a great deal of magic for you in my time，your Majesty，”said the Royal Wizard．“As a matter of fact，I just happen to have in my pocket a list of the wizardries I have performed for you．”He drew a paper from a deep pocket of his robe．“It begins：‘Dear Royal Wizard：I am returning herewith the so-called philosopher's stone which you claimed—’ no，that isn't it．”The Royal Wizard brought a long scroll of parchment from another pocket of his robe．“Here it is，”he said．“Now，let's see．I have squeezed blood out of turnips for you，and turnips out of blood．I have produced rabbits out of silk hats，and silk hats out of rabbits．I have conjured up flowers，tambourines，and doves out of nowhere，and nowhere out of flowers，tambourines，and doves．I have brought you divining rods，magic wands，and crystal spheres in which to behold the future．I have compounded philters，unguents，and potions，to cure heartbreak，surfeit，and ringing in the ears．I have made you my own special mixture of wolfbane，nightshade，and eagles’ tears，to ward off witches，demons，and things that go bump in the night．I have given you seven-league boots，the golden touch，and a cloak of invisibility—”

“It didn't work，”said the King．“The clock of invisibility didn't work．”

“Yes，it did，”said the Royal Wizard．

“No，it didn't，”said the King．“I kept bumping into things，the same as ever．”

“The cloak is supposed to make you invisible，”said the Royal Wizard．“It is not supposed to keep you from bumping into things．”

“All I know is，I kept bumping into things，”said the King．

The Royal Wizard looked at his list again．“I got you，”he said，“horns from Elfland，sand from the Sandman，and gold from the rainbow．Also a spool of thread，a paper of needles and a lump of beeswax—sorry，those are things my wife wrote down for me to get her．”

“What I want you to do now，”said the King，“is to get me the moon．The Princess Lenore wants the moon，and when she gets it，she will be well again．”

“Nobody can get the moon，”said the Royal Wizard．“It is 150,000 miles away，and it is made of green cheese，and it is twice as big as this palace．”

The King flew into another rage and sent the Royal Wizard back to his cave．Then he rang a gong and summoned the Royal Mathematician．

The Royal Mathematician was a bald-headed，nearsighted man，with a skullcap on his head and a pencil behind each ear．He wore a black suit with white numbers on it．

“I don't want to hear a long list of all the things you have figured out for me since 1907，”the King said to him．“I want you to figure out right now how to get the moon for the Princess Lenore．When she gets the moon，she will be well again．”

“I am glad you mentioned all the things I have figured out for you since 1907，”said the Royal Mathematician．“It so happens that I have a list of them with me．”

He pulled a long scroll of parchment out of a pocket and looked at it．“Now，let me see．I have figured out for you the distance between the horns of a dilemma，night and day，and A and Z．I have computed how far is Up，how long it takes to get to Away，and what becomes of Gone．I have discovered the length of the sea serpent，the price of the priceless，and the square of the hippopotamus．I know where you are when you are at Sixes and Sevens，how much Is you have to have to make an Are，and how many birds you can catch with the salt in the ocean—187，796，132，if it would interest you to know．”

“There aren't that many birds，”said the King．

“I didn't say there were，”said the Royal Mathematician．“I said if there were．”

“I don't want to hear about seven hundred million imaginary birds，”said the King．“I want you to get the moon for the Princess Lenore．”

“The moon is 300,000 miles away，”said the Royal Mathematician．“It is round and flat like a coin，only it is made of asbestos，and it is half the size of this kingdom．Furthermore，it is pasted on the sky．Nobody can get the moon．”

The King flew into still another rage and sent the Royal Mathematician away．Then he rang for the Court Jester．

The Jester came bounding into the throne room in his motley and his cap and bells，and sat at the foot of the throne．

“What can I do for you，your Majesty？”asked the court Jester．

“Nobody can do anything for me，”said the King mournfully．“The Princess Lenore wants the moon，and she cannot be well till she gets it，but nobody can get it for her．Every time I ask anybody for the moon，it gets larger and farther away．There is nothing you can do for me except play on your lute．Something sad．”

“How big do they say the moon is，”ask the court Jester．“And how far away？”

“The Lord High Chamberlain says it is 35,000 miles away，and bigger than the Princess Lenore's room，”said the King．“The Royal Wizard says it is 150,000 miles away，and twice as big as this palace．The Royal Mathematician says it is 300,000 miles away，and half the size of this kingdom．”

The Court Jester strummed on his lute for a little while．“They are all wise men，”he said，“and so they must all be right．If they are all right，then the moon must be just as large and as far away as each person thinks it is．The thing to do is find out how big the Princess Lenore thinks it is，and how far away．”

“I never thought of that，”said the King．

“I will go and ask her，your Majesty，”said the Court Jester．And he crept softly into the little girl's room．

The Princess Lenore was awake，and she was glad to see the Court Jester，but her face was very pale and her voice very weak．

“Have you brought the moon to me？”She asked．

“Not yet，”said the Court Jester，“but I will get it for you right away．How big do you think it is？”

“It is just a little smaller than my thumbnail，”she said，“for when I hold my thumbnail up at the moon，it just covers it．”

“And how far away is it？”asked the Court Jester．

“It is not as high as the big tree outside my window，”said the Princess，“for sometimes it gets caught in the top branches．”

“It will be very easy to get the moon for you，”said the Court Jester．“I will climb the tree tonight when it gets caught in the top branches and bring it to you．”

Then he thought of something else．“What is the moon made of，Princess？”he asked．

“Oh，”she said，“it's made of gold，of course，silly．”

The Court Jester left the Princess Lenore's room and went to see the Royal Goldsmith．He had the Royal Goldsmith make a tiny round golden moon just a little smaller than the thumbnail of the Princess Lenore．Then he had him string it on a golden chain so the Princess could wear it around her neck．

“What is this thing I have made？”asked the Royal Goldsmith when he had finished it．

“You have made the moon，”said the Court Jester．“That is the moon．”

“But the moon，”said the Royal Goldsmith，“is 500,000 miles away and is made of bronze and is round like a marble．”

“That's what you think，”said the Court Jester as he went away with the moon．

The Court Jester took the moon to the Princess Lenore，and she was overjoyed．The next day she was well again and could get up and go out in the gardens to play．

But the King's worries were not yet over．He knew that the moon would shine in the sky again that night，and he did not want the Princess Lenore to see it．If she did，she would know that the moon she wore on a chain around her neck was not the real moon．

So the King sent for the Lord High Chamberlain and said，“We must keep the Princess Lenore from seeing the moon when it shines in the sky tonight．Think of something．”

The Lord High Chamberlain tapped his forehead with his fingers thoughtfully and said，“I know just the thing．We can make some dark glasses for the Princess Lenore．We can make them so dark that she will not be able to see anything at all through them．Then she will not be able to see the moon when it shines in the sky．”

This made the King very angry，and he shook his head from side to side．“If she wore dark glasses，she would bump into things，”he said，“and then she would be ill again．”So he sent the Lord High Chamberlain away and called the Royal Wizard．

“We must hide the moon，”said the King，“so that the Princess Lenore will not see it when it shines in the sky tonight．How are we going to do that？”

The Royal Wizard stood on his hands and then he stood on his head and then he stood on his feet again．

“I know what we can do，”he said．“We can stretch some black velvet curtains on poles．The curtains will cover all the palace gardens like a circus tent，and the Princess Lenore will not be able to see through them，so she will not see the moon in the sky．”

The King was so angry at this that he waved his arms around．“Black velvet curtains would keep out the air，”he said．“The Princess Lenore would not be able to breathe，and she would be ill again．”So he sent the Royal Wizard away and summoned the Royal Mathematician．

“We must do something，”said the king，“so that the Princess Lenore will not see the moon when it shines in the sky tonight．If you know so much，figure out a way to do that．”

The Royal Mathematician walked around in a circle，and then he walked around in a square，and then he stood still．“I have it！”he said．

“We can set off fireworks in the gardens every night．We will make a lot of silver fountains and golden cascades，and when they go off，they will fill the sky with so many sparks that it will be as light as day and the Princess Lenore will not be able to see the moon．”

The King flew into such a rage that he began jumping up and down．“Fireworks would keep the Princess Lenore awake，”he said．“She would not get any sleep at all and she would be ill again．”So the King sent the Royal Mathematician away．

When he looked up again，it was dark outside and he saw the bright rim of the moon just peeping over the horizon．He jumped up in a great fright and rang for the Court Jester．The Court Jester came bounding into the room and sat down at the foot of the throne．

“What can I do for you，your Majesty？”he asked．

“Nobody can do anything for me，”said the King mournfully．“The moon is coming up again．It will shine into the Princess Lenore's bedroom，and she will know it is still in the sky and that she does not wear it on a golden chain around her neck．Play me something on your lute，something very sad，for when the Princess sees the moon，she will be ill again．”

The Court Jester strummed on his lute．“What do your wise men say？”he asked．

“They can think of no way to hide the moon that will not make the Princess Lenore ill，”said the King．

The Court Jester played another song，very softly，“Your wise men know everything，”he said，“and if they cannot hide the moon，then it cannot be hidden．”

The King put his head in his hands again and sighed．

Suddenly he jumped up from his throne and pointed to the windows．“Look！”he cried．“The moon is already shining into the Princess Lenore's bedroom．Who can explain how the moon can be shining in the sky when it is hanging on a golden chain around her neck？”

The Court Jester stopped playing on his lute．“Who could explain how to get the moon when your wise men said it was too large and too far away？ It was the Princess Lenore．Therefore the Princess Lenore is wiser than your wise men and knows more about the moon than they do．So I will ask her．”And before the king could stop him，the court Jester slipped quietly out of the throne room and up the wide marble staircase to the Princess Lenore's bedroom．

The Princess was lying in bed，but she was wide awake and she was looking out the window at the moon shining in the sky．Shining in her hand was the moon the Court Jester had got for her．He looked very sad，and there seemed to be tears in his eyes．

“Tell me，Princess Lenore，”he said mournfully，“how can the moon be shining in the sky when it is hanging on a golden chain around your neck？”

The Princess looked at him and laughed．“That is easy，silly，”she said．“When I lose a tooth，a new one grows in its place，doesn't it？”

“Of course，”said the Court Jester．“And when the unicorn loses his horn in the forest，a new one grows in the middle of his forehead．”

“That is right，”said the Princess．“And when the Royal Gardener cuts the flowers in the garden，other flowers come to take their place．”

“I should have thought of that，”said the Court Jester，“for it is the same way with the daylight．”

“And it is the same way with the moon，”said the Princess Lenore．“I guess it is the same way with everything．”Her voice became very low and faded away，and the Court Jester saw that she was asleep．Gently he tucked the covers in around the sleeping Princess．

But before he left the room，he went over to the window and winked at the moon，for it seemed to the Court Jester that the moon had winked at him．





The Great Quillow


Ⅰ


Once upon a time，in a far country，there lived a giant named Hunder．He was so enormous in height and girth and weight that little waves were set in motion in distant lakes when he walked．His great fingers could wrench a clock from its steeple as easily as a child might remove a peanut from its shell．Every morning he devoured three sheep，a pie made of a thousand apples and a chocolate as high and as wide as a spinning wheel．It would have taken six ordinary men to lift the great brass key to his front door，and four to carry one of the candles with which he lighted his house．

It was Hunder's way to strip a town of its sheep and apples and chocolate，its leather and cloth，its lumber and tallow and brass，and then move on to a new far village and begin his depredations again．

There had been no men strong enough to thwart his evil ways in any of the towns he had set upon and impoverished．He had broken their most formidable weapons between his thumb and forefinger，laughing like the hurricane．

And there had been no men cunning enough in any of the towns to bring about his destruction．He had crushed their most ingenious traps with the toe of his mammoth boot，guffawing like a volcano．

One day Hunder strode hundreds and hundreds of leagues and came to a little town in a green valley．It was a staunch little town and a firm little valley，but they quaked with the sound of his coming．The houses were narrow and two stories high；the streets were narrow and cobbled．There were not many people in the town：a hundred men，a hundred women，a hundred children．

Every Tuesday night at seven o'clock a council of ten met to administer the simple affairs of the community．The councilors were the most important tradesmen and artisans of New Moon Street，a short，narrow，cobbled street that ran east and west．These men were the tailor，the butcher，the candymaker，the blacksmith，the baker，the candlemaker，the lamplighter，the cobbler，the carpenter，and the locksmith．After the small business of the tranquil town had been taken care of，the council members sat around and speculated as to the number of stars in the sky，discussed the wonderful transparency of glass，and praised the blueness of violets and the whiteness of snow．Then they made a little fun of Quillow，the toymaker （whose work they considered a rather pretty waste of time），and went home．

Quillow，the toymaker，did not belong to the council，but he attended all its meetings．The councilmen were fond of Quillow because of the remarkable toys he made，and because he was a droll and gentle fellow．Quillow made all kinds of familiar playthings on his long and littered workbench：music boxes，jumping jacks，building blocks；but he was famous for a number of little masterpieces of his own invention：a clown who juggled three marbles，a woodman who could actually chop wood，a trumpeter who could play seven notes of a song on a tiny horn，a paperweight in which roses burst into bloom in falling snow．

Quillow was as amusing to look at as any of his toys．He was the shortest man in town，being only five feet tall．His ears were large，his nose was long，his mouth was small，and he had a shock of white hair that stood straight up like a dandelion clock．The lapels of his jacket were wide．He wore a red tie in a deep-pointed collar，and his pantaloons were baggy and unpressed．At Christmas time each year Quillow made little hearts of gold for the girls of the town and hearts of oak for the boys．He considered himself something of a civic figure，since he had designed the spouting dolphins in the town fountain，the wooden animals on the town merry-go-round，and the twelve scarlet men who emerged from the dial of the town clock on the stroke of every hour and played a melody on little silver bells with little silver hammers．

It was the custom of Quillow's colleagues to shout merrily，“Why，here comes the Great Quillow！”when the toymaker appeared．The lamplighter or the tailor or the locksmith would sometimes creep up behind him and pretend to wind a key in his back as if he were a mechanical figure of his own devising．Quillow took all this in good part，and always，when the imaginary key in his back was turned，he would walk about stiff-legged，with jerky movements of his arms，joining in the fun and increasing the laughter．

It was different on the day the giant arrived．Laughter was hushed and the people hid in their houses and talked in frightened whispers when Hunder's great bulk appeared like a cyclone in the sky and the earth shook beneath him．

Panting a little after his thousand-league walk，Hunder pulled up four trees from a hillside to make room for his great hulk，and sat down．Hunder surveyed the town and grunted．There was no one to be seen in the streets．Not even a cat crept over the cobblestones．

“Ho，town！”bawled Hunder．The doors shook and the windows rattled．“Ho，town！ Send me your clerk that you may hear Hunder's will！”

The town clerk gathered up quill and ink and parchment．“There are ninety-nine other men in town，”he grumbled，“but it's the town clerk this，and the town clerk that，and the town clerk everything．”He walked out of his house，still grumbling，and trudged across the valley to hear the giant's will．

An hour later the town clerk sat at the head of a long table in the council room and began to call the roll．“We're all here，”snapped the blacksmith．“You can see that．”

The clerk continued with the roll call．

“Baker，”he called．

“Here，”said the baker．

“Blacksmith，”he droned．

“Here，”said the blacksmith sourly．

The clerk finished calling the roll and looked over his spectacles．“We have a visitor tonight，as usual，”he said，“Quillow，the toymaker．I will make the proper entry in the minutes．”

“Never mind the minutes，”said the blacksmith．“Read us the demands of Hunder the giant．”

The clerk entered Quillow's name in the minutes．“Now，”he said，“I will read the minutes of the last meeting．”

The candymaker stood up．“Let's dispense with the minutes of the last meeting，”he said．

The clerk looked over his spectacles．“It must be properly moved and duly seconded，”he said．It was properly moved and duly seconded．“Now read the demands of Hunder the giant！”shouted the blacksmith．

The clerk rapped on the table with his gavel．“Next，”he said，“comes unfinished business．We have before us a resolution to regulate the speed of merry-go-rounds．”

“Dispense with it！”bawled the blacksmith．

“It must be properly moved and duly seconded，”said the clerk．It was properly moved and duly seconded and the clerk at last unrolled a long scroll of parchment．“We come now，”he said，“to the business of the day．I have here the demands of Hunder the giant．The document is most irregular．It does not contain a single ‘greeting’ or ‘whereas’ or ‘be it known by these presents’！”

Everyone sat motionless as the clerk began to read the scroll．“I，Hunder，must have three sheep every morning，”he read．

“That would use up all the sheep in the valley in a week and a fortnight，”said the butcher，“and there would be no mutton for our own people．”

“I，Hunder，must have a chocolate a day as high and as wide as a spinning wheel，”read the town clerk．

“Why，that would exhaust all the chocolate in my storeroom in three days！”cried the candymaker．

The town clerk read from the parchment again．“I，Hunder，must have a new jerkin made for me in a week and a fortnight．”

“Why，I would have to work night and day to make a jerkin in a week and a fortnight for so large a giant，”gasped the tailor，“and it would use up all the cloth on my shelves and in my basement．”

“I，Hunder，”went on the town clerk，“must have a new pair of boots within a week and a fortnight．”

The cobbler moaned as he heard this．“Why，I would have to work night and day to make a pair of boots for so large a giant in a week and a fortnight，”he said．“And it would use up all the leather in my workshop and in my back room．”

The council members shook their heads sadly as each demand was read off by the town clerk．Quillow had folded his arms and crossed his legs and shut his eyes．He was thinking，but he looked like a sleeping toy．

“I，Hunder，”droned the town clerk．“must have an apple pie each morning made of a thousand apples．”

The baker jumped from his chair．“Why，that would use up all the apples and flour and shortening in town in a week and a fortnight，”he cried．“And it would take me night and day to make such a pie，so that I could bake no more pies or cakes or cookies，or blueberry muffins or cinnamon buns or cherry boats or strawberry tarts or plum puddings for the people of the town．”

All of the councilmen moaned sadly because they loved the list of good things the baker had recited．Quillow still sat with his eyes closed．

“I，Hunder，”went on the town clerk，“must have a house to live in by the time a week and a fortnight have passed．”

The carpenter wept openly．“Why，I would have to work night and day to build a house for so large a giant in a week and a fortnight，”sobbed the carpenter．“All my nephews and uncles and cousins would have to help me，and it would use up all the wood and pegs and hinges and glass in my shop and in the countryside．”

The locksmith stood up and shook his fist in the direction of the hillside on which the giant lay snoring．“I will have to work night and day to make a brass key large enough to fit the keyhole in the front door of the house of so large a giant，”he said．“It will use up all the brass in my shop and in the community．”

“And I will have to make a candle for his bedside so large it will use up all the wick and tallow in my shop and the world！”said the candlemaker．

“This is the final item，”said the town clerk．“I，Hunder，must be told a tale each day to keep me amused．”

Quillow opened his eyes and raised his hand．“I will be the teller of tales，”he said．“I will keep the giant amused．”

The town clerk put away his scroll．

“Does anyone have any idea of how to destroy the giant Hunder？”asked the candymaker．

“I could creep up on him in the dark and set fire to him with my lighter，”said the lamplighter．

Quillow looked at him．“The fire of your lighter would not harm him any more than a spark struck by a colt-shoe in a meadow，”said Quillow．

“Quillow is right，”said the blacksmith．“But I could build secretly at night an enormous catapult which would cast a gigantic stone and crush Hunder．”

Quillow shook his head．“He would catch the stone as a child catches a ball，”said Quillow，“and he would cast it back at the town and squash all our houses．”

“I could put needles in his suit，”said the tailor．

“I could put nails in his boots，”said the cobbler．

“I could put oil in his chocolates，”said the candymaker．

“I could put stones in his mutton，”said the butcher．

“I could put tacks in his pies，”said the baker．

“I could put gunpowder in his candles，”said the candlemaker．

“I could make the handle of his brass key as sharp as a sword，”said the locksmith．

“I could build the roof of his house insecurely so that it would fall on him，”said the carpenter．

“The plans you suggest，”said Quillow，“would merely annoy Hunder as the gadfly annoys the horse and the flea annoys the dog．”

“Perhaps the Great Quillow has a plan of his own，”said the blacksmith with a scornful laugh．

“Has the Great Quillow a plan？”asked the candymaker，with a faint sneer．

The little toymaker did not answer．The councilors got up and filed slowly and sadly from the council room．That night none of them wound the imaginary key in Quillow's back．





Ⅱ


Quillow did not leave the council chamber for a long time，and when he walked through New Moon Street，all the shops of the councilmen were brightly lighted and noisily busy．There was a great ringing and scraping and thumping and rustling．The blacksmith was helping the locksmith make the great brass key for Hunder's house．The carpenter was sawing and planing enormous boards．The baker was shaping the crust for a gigantic pie，and his wife and apprentice were peeling a thousand apples．The butcher was dressing the first of the three sheep．The tailor was cutting the cloth for Hunder's jerkin．The cobbler was fitting together mammoth pieces of leather for Hunder's boots．The candymaker was piling all his chocolate upon his largest table，while his wife and his daughter made soft filling in great kettles．The candlemaker had begun to build the monumental candle for Hunder's bedside．

As Quillow reached the door of his shop，the town clock in its steeple began to strike，the moon broke out of a patch of cloud，and the toymaker stood with his hand on the door latch to watch the twelve little men in scarlet hats and jackets and pantaloons emerge，each from his own numeral，to make the night melodious with the sound of their silver hammers on the silver bells of the round white dial．

Inside his shop，Quillow lighted the green-shaded lamp over his workbench，which was littered with odds and ends and beginnings and middles of all kinds of toys．Working swiftly with his shining tools，Quillow began to make a figure eight inches high out of wire and cloth and leather and wood．When it was finished it looked like a creature you might come upon hiding behind a tulip or playing with toads．It had round eyes，a round nose and a wide mouth，and no hair．It was blue from head to foot．Its face was blue，its jacket was blue，its pantaloons were blue，and its feet were blue．

As Quillow stood examining the toy，the lamplighter stuck his head in the door without knocking，stared for a moment，and went away．Quillow smiled with satisfaction and began to make another blue man．By the time the first cock crowed he had made ten blue men and put them away in a long wooden chest with a heavy iron clasp．

The lamplighter turned out the last street light，the sun rose，the crickets stopped calling and the clock struck five．Disturbed by the changing pattern of light and sound，the giant on the hills turned in his sleep．Around a corner into New Moon Street tiptoed the town crier．“Sh！”he said to the lamplighter．“Don't wake the giant．”

“Sh！”said the lamplighter．“His food may not be ready．”

The town crier stood in the cobbled street and called softly，“Five o'clock and all's well！”

All the doors in New Moon Street except Quillow's flew open．

“The pie is baked，”said the baker．

“The chocolate is made，”said the candymaker．

“The sheep are dressed，”said the butcher．

“I worked all night on the great brass key，”said the locksmith，“and the blacksmith helped me with his hammer and anvil．”

“I have scarcely begun the enormous candle，”said the candlemaker．

“I am weary of sawing and planing，”said the carpenter．

“My fingers are already stiff，”said the tailor，“and I have just started the giant's jerkin．”

“My eyes are tired，”said the cobbler，“and I have hardly begun to make his boots．”

The sun shone full on the giant's face，and he woke up and yawned loudly．The councilors jumped，and a hundred children hid in a hundred closets．

“Ho！”roared Hunder．It was the sign the blacksmith had waited for．He drove his wagon drawn by four horses into New Moon Street and climbed down．

“Ho！”roared the giant．

“Heave，”grunted the councilors as they lifted the sheep onto the wagon．

“Ho！”roared the giant．

“Heave，”grunted the councilors and up went the pie．

“Ho！”roared the giant．

“Heave，”grunted the councilors，and they set the great chocolate in place．

Hunder watched the loading of the wagon，licking his lips and growling like a cave full of bulldogs．

The councilors climbed up on the wagon and the blacksmith yelled “Giddap！”and then “Whoa！”He glared about him．“Where is Quillow？”he demanded．“Where is that foolish little fellow？”

“He was in his shop at midnight，”said the lamplighter，“making toys．”

The nine other councilors snorted．

“He could have helped with the key，”said the locksmith．

“The pie，”said the baker．

“The sheep，”said the butcher．

“The boots，”said the cobbler．

At this，Quillow bounced out of his shop like a bird from a clock，bowing and smiling．

“Well！”snarled the blacksmith．

“Ho！”roared Hunder．

“Good morning，”said Quillow．He climbed up on the wagon and the blacksmith spoke to each horse in turn．（Their names were Lobo，Bolo，Olob，and Obol.）

“I worked all night with my hammer and anvil，”said the blacksmith as the horses lurched ahead，“helping the locksmith with the great brass key．”He scowled at Quillow．“The lamplighter tells us you spent the night making toys．”

“Making toys，”said Quillow cheerily，“and thinking up a tale to amuse the giant Hunder．”

The blacksmith snorted．“And a hard night you must have spent hammering out your tale．”

“And twisting it，”said the locksmith．

“And leveling it，”said the carpenter．

“And rolling it out，”said the baker．

“And stitching it up，”said the tailor．

“And fitting it together，”said the cobbler．

“And building it around a central thread，”said the candlemaker．

“And dressing it up，”said the butcher．

“And making it not too bitter and not too sweet，”said the candymaker．

When the wagon came to a stop at Hunder's feet，the giant clapped his hands，and Quillow and the councilors were blown to the ground．Hunder roared with laughter and unloaded the wagon in half a trice．

“Tell me your silly names，”said Hunder，“and what you do．”

The new slaves of Hunder，all except Quillow，bowed in turn and told the giant who they were and what they did．

Quillow remained silent．

“You，smallest of men，you with the white hair，who are you？”demanded Hunder．

“I am Quillow，the teller of tales，”said the toy-maker，but unlike the others he did not bow to the giant．

“Bow！”roared Hunder．

“Wow！”shouted Quillow．

The councilors started back in dismay at the toymaker's impertinence，their widening eyes on Hunder's mighty hands，which closed and then slowly opened．The black scowl cleared from the giant's brow and he laughed suddenly．

“You are a fairly droll fellow，”he said．“Perhaps your tales will amuse me．If they do not，I will put you in the palm of my hand and blow you so far it will take men five days to find you．Now be off to your work，the rest of you！”

As the wagon carried the frightened councilors back to town，Quillow sat on the ground and watched the giant eat a sheep as an ordinary man might eat a lark．“Now，”said Hunder，“tell me a tale．”

“Once upon a time，”began Quillow，crossing his legs and tickling a cricket with a blade of grass，“a giant came to our town from a thousand leagues away，stepping over the hills and rivers．He was so mighty a giant that he could stamp upon the ground with his foot and cause the cows in the fields to turn flip-flops in the air and land on their feet again．”

“Garf，”growled Hunder，“I can stamp upon the ground with my foot and empty a lake of its water．”

“I have no doubt of that，O Hunder，”said Quillow，“for the thunder is your plaything and the mountains are your stool．But the giant who came over the hills and rivers many and many a year ago was a lesser giant than Hunder．He was weak．He fell ill of a curious malady．He was forced to run to the ocean and bathe in the yellow waters，for only the yellow waters in the middle of the sea could cure the giant．”

“Rowf，”snarled Hunder，picking up another sheep．“That giant was a goose，that giant was a grasshopper．Hunder is never sick．”The giant smote his chest and then his stomach mighty blows without flinching，to show how strong he was．

“This other giant，”said Quillow，“had no ailment of the chest or the stomach or the mouth or the ears or the eyes or the arms or the legs．”

“Where else can a giant have an ailment？”demanded Hunder．

Quillow looked dreamily across the green valley toward the town，which was bright in the sun．“In the mind，”said Quillow，“for the mind is a strange and intricate thing．In lesser men than Hunder，it is subject to mysterious maladies．”

“Wumf，”said the giant，beginning his third sheep．“Hunder's mind is strong like the rock．”He smote himself heavily across the forehead without wincing．

“No one to this day knows what brought on this dreadful disease in the mind of the other giant，”said Quillow．“Perhaps he killed a turtle after sundown，or ran clockwise thrice around a church in the dark of the moon，or slept too close to a field of asphodel．”

Hunder picked up the pie and began to devour it．“Did this goose，this grasshopper，have pains in his head？”he asked．“Look，teller of tales！”Hunder banged his head savagely against a tree，and the trunk of the tree snapped in two．The giant grinned，showing his jagged teeth．

“This other giant，”said Quillow，“suffered no pain．His symptoms were marvelous and dismaying．First he heard the word．For fifteen minutes one morning，beginning at a quarter of six，he heard the word．”

“Harumph！”said Hunder，finishing his pie and reaching for his chocolate．“What was the word the giant heard for fifteen minutes one day？”

“The word was ‘woddly’，”said Quillow．“All words were one word to him．All words were ‘woddly’．”

“All words are different to Hunder，”said the giant．“And do you call this a tale you have told me？ A blithering goose of a giant hears a word and you call that a tale to amuse Hunder？”

Quillow arose as the clock in the steeple struck six and the scarlet figures came out to play the silver bells．

“I hear all words，”said Hunder．“This is a good chocolate；otherwise I should put you in the palm of my hand and blow you over the housetops．”

“I shall bring you a better tale tomorrow，”said Quillow．“Meanwhile，be sure to see the first star over your left shoulder，do not drink facing downstream，and always sleep with your heart to the east．”

“Why should Hunder practice this foolish rigmarole？”asked the giant．

“No one knows to this day，”said Quillow，“what caused the weird illness in the mind of the other giant．”But Hunder gave only a murmurous growl in reply，for he had lain down again on the hillside and closed his eyes．Quillow smiled as he saw that the giant lay with his heart to the east．

The toymaker spent the day making twenty more little blue men and when the first owl hooted he stood in the doorway of his shop and whistled．The hundred children collected in the cobbled street before the toyshop from every nook and corner and cranny and niche of the town．“Go to your homes，”said Quillow，“each Sue and John of you，each Nora and Joe，and tell your fathers and mothers to come to the merry-go-round in the carnival grounds one quarter-hour before the moon comes over the hill．Say that Quillow has a plan to destroy the giant Hunder．”

The group of children broke like the opening of a rose and the cobbled streets rang with the sound of their running．

Even the scowling blacksmith，the scornful lamplighter，the mumbling town crier，and the fussy town clerk （who had spent the day searching for an ancient treaty the people of the town had once signed with a giant） came at the appointed hour to hear what Quillow had to say．

“What is this clown's whim that brings us here like sheep？”demanded the blacksmith．

Quillow climbed up on the merry-go-round，sat on a swan，and spoke．At first there was a restless stir like wind in the grass，but as Quillow explained his plan，even the chattering wives fell silent．Quillow finished speaking as the moon peeped over the hill，and the hundred men and the hundred women and the hundred children straggled away from the carnival grounds．

“It will never work，”said the lamplighter．

“It is worth trying，”said the candymaker．

“I have a better plan，”said the town crier．“Let all the women and all the children stand in the streets and gaze sorrowfully at the giant，and perhaps he will go away．”

His wife took him by the arm and led him home．“We will try Quillow's plan，”she said．“He has a magic，the little man．”

The next morning，just as the clock in the steeple struck five，the weary blacksmith，with Quillow sitting beside him，drove the wagon loaded with three sheep and a fresh apple pie and another monster chocolate to where the giant sat on the hillside．Hunder unloaded the wagon in a third of a trice，placed the food beside him on the hill，and began to gnaw at a sheep．“Tell me a tale，smallest of men，”he said，“and see to it that I do not nod，or I shall put you in the palm of my hand and blow you through yonder cloud．”

“Once upon a time，”began Quillow，“there was a king named Anderblusdaferafan，and he had three sons named Ufabrodoborobe，Quamdelrodolanderay，and Tristolcomofarasee．”

“Those names are hard names，”said Hunder．“Tell me those names again that I may remember them．”So Quillow started over slowly with “Once upon a time，”and again the giant made him repeat the names．

“Why did this king and his sons have such long and difficult names？”demanded Hunder，eating his second sheep．

“Ah，”said Quillow，“it was because of the king's mother，whose name was Isoldasadelofandaloo．”

“Tell me her name once more，”said Hunder，“that I may remember it．”So Quillow told him the name again slowly．

Thus the wily Quillow，who really had thought of no tale to tell，wasted the long minutes as the hands of the clock in the steeple crept around the dial．As they neared a quarter of six o'clock，Quillow went on．“One day as the king and his sons were riding through the magical forest，”he said，“they came upon a woddly．Woddlywoddlywoddly．Woddlywoddlywoddly．”

The giant's eyes grew narrow，then wide．

“Woddlywoddlywoddly，”said Quillow，“woddlywoddly woddlywoddly．”

The giant dropped the chocolate he was eating．“Say it with words！”he bellowed．“You say naught but ‘woddly’．”

Quillow looked surprised．“Woddlywoddlywoddlywoddlywoddly woddlywoddlywoddly，”he said．“Woddlywoddlywoddly．”

“Can this be the malady come upon me？”cried the giant．He caught the toymaker up in his hand．“Or do you seek to frighten Hunder？”he roared．

“Woddlywoddlywoddly，”said Quillow，trembling in spite of himself，as he pointed to a farmer in a field and to a child gathering cowslips and to the town crier making his rounds．“Woddlywoddlywoddly，”repeated Quillow．

The giant dropped Quillow and arose．He strode to where the farmer stood and picked him up．“Say words！”bawled Hunder．“Say many words！”

“Woddly，”said the farmer，and Hunder dropped him in the field and turned to the child．

“What is your name？”roared Hunder．

“Woddlywoddly，”said the child．

Hunder stepped over to the town crier．“What is the time of the day？”he bellowed．

“Woddlywoddly，”said the town crier．

Then Hunder shouted questions at men and women and children who came running into the streets．He asked them how old they were，and what day it was，and where they were going，and how they were feeling．And they said，“Woddly”and “Woddlywoddly”and “Woddlywoddlywoddly．”

Hunder strode back across the green valley to where Quillow sat brushing flies off the half-eaten chocolate．“It is the malady！ I have heard the word！ It is the malady！”cried Hunder．“What am I to do to cure the malady？”

Just then the clock in the steeple struck six，and as the scarlet men came out to play the bells，Quillow spoke reproachfully．“I was telling you how the king and his three sons rode through the magical forest，”he said，“when you picked me up and flung me to the earth and ran away，leaving your chocolate uneaten．”

The giant sat on the ground，panting heavily，his lower teeth showing．“I heard the word，”he said．“All men said the word．”

“What word？”asked Quillow．

“Woddly，”said the giant．

“That is but the first symptom，”said Quillow reassuringly，“and it has passed．Look at the chimneys of the town．Are they not red？”

Hunder looked．“Yes，the chimneys are red，”said Hunder．

“Why do you ask if the chimneys are red？”

“So long as the chimneys are red，”said Quillow，“you have no need to worry，for when the second symptom is upon you，the chimneys of the town turn black．”

“I see only red chimneys，”said the giant．“But what could have caused Hunder to hear the word？”he asked as he hurled the half-eaten chocolate far away over the roofs of the town．

“Perhaps，”said Quillow，“you stepped on a centaur's grave or waked the sleeping unicorn or whistled on Saint Nillin's Day．”

Hunder the giant rested badly on the hillside that night，twisting and turning in his sleep，tormented by ominous dreams．While he slept，the youngest and most agile men of the town，in black smocks and slippered feet，climbed to the roofs of the houses and shops，each carrying a full pail and a brush，and painted all the chimneys black．

Quillow，the toymaker，worked busily all night，and by the dark hour before the dawn，had made twenty more blue men so that he now had fifty blue men in all．He put the new ones with the others he had made，in the large chest with the iron clasp．





Ⅳ


As the first birds twittered in the trees，the lamplighter and the town crier came into the toyshop．Quillow was repairing a doll for a little girl who was ill．He smiled and bowed to his friends confidently，but the palms of their hands were moist and the roofs of their mouths were dry．

“Perhaps he will detect your trick，”said the lamplighter．

“Perhaps he will smash all our houses，”said the town crier．As the three men talked，they heard the giant stirring on the hillside．He rubbed his eyes with his great knuckles，yawned with the sound of a sinking ship，and stretched his powerful arms．The toymaker and the lamplighter and the town crier watched through a window and held their breath．

Hunder sat up，staring at the ground and running his fingers through his hair．Then slowly he lifted his head and looked at the town．He closed his eyes tightly and opened them again and stared．His mouth dropped open and he lurched to his feet．“The chimneys！”he bellowed．“The chimneys are black！ The malady is upon me again！”

Quillow began to scamper through the cobbled streets and across the green valley as the giant's eyes rolled and his knees trembled．“Teller of tales，smallest of men！”bellowed Hunder．“Tell me what I must do．The chimneys are black！”Quillow reached the feet of the giant，panting and flushed．“Look，teller of tales，”said the giant，“name me fairly the color of yonder chimneys．”

Quillow turned and looked toward the town．“The chimneys are red，O Hunder，”he said．“The chimneys are red．See how they outdo the red rays of the sun．”

“The rays of the sun are red，”said Hunder，“but the chimneys of the town are black．”

“You tremble，”said Quillow，“and your tongue hangs out，and these are indeed the signs of the second symptom．But still there is no real danger，for you do not see the blue men．Or do you see the blue men，O Hunder？”he asked．

“I see the men of the town standing in the streets and staring at me，”said Hunder．“But their faces are white and they wear clothes of many colors．Why do you ask me if I see blue men？”

Quillow put on a look of grave concern．“When you see the blue men，”he said，“it is the third and last symptom of the malady．If that should happen，you must rush to the sea and bathe in the yellow waters or your strength will become the strength of a kitten．”

The giant groaned．“Perhaps if you fast for a day and a night，”said Quillow，“the peril will pass．”

“I will do as you say，teller of tales，”said the giant，“for you are wise beyond the manner of men．Bring me no food today，tell me no tale．”And with a moan Hunder sat back upon the hillside and covered his eyes with his hands．

When Quillow returned to the town，the people cheered him softly and the children flung flowers at his feet．But the blacksmith was skeptical．“The giant is still there on the hillside，”he said．“I shall save my cheers and my flowers until the day he is gone，if that day shall ever come．”And he stalked back to his smithy to help the locksmith make the great brass key for Hunder's front door．

That noon there was enough mutton and pie and chocolate for all the people of the town，and they ate merrily and well．





Ⅴ


Hunder the giant fretted and worried so profoundly during the day that he fell quickly to sleep as the night came．It was a night without moon or stars，as Quillow had hoped．A town owl who lived on the roof of the tavern—at the Sign of the Clock and Soldier—was surprised at the soft and shadowy activities of the toymaker．The bat and the firefly hovered about him in wonder as he worked secretly and swiftly in the green valley at the feet of the snoring giant．The squirrel and the nightingale watched like figures in a tapestry as he dug and planted in the woods at the giant's head．If the giant thrashed suddenly in his sleep or groaned，the cricket and the frog fell silent in high anxiety．When Quillow's work was finished and he returned to his shop，the bat and the firefly moved in dreamy circles，the squirrel and the nightingale stirred freely again，and the cricket and the frog began to sing．The owl on the roof of the Clock and Soldier nodded and slept．Quillow lay down on his workbench and closed his eyes．

When the scarlet men played the bells of five o'clock，and the first birds twittered in the trees and the gray light came，Quillow awoke and opened his door．The town crier stood in the cobbled street in front of the shop．“Cry the hour，”said Quillow．“Cry all's well．”

“Five o'clock！”cried the town crier．“Five o'clock and all's well！”

The people crept out of their houses and on the hillside across the green valley，Hunder the giant stirred and yawned and stretched and rubbed his eyes and sat up．He saw that the chimneys were still black，but he grinned at them and winked．“The malady passes，”said Hunder．“I see men with white faces wearing clothes of many colors，but I see no blue men．”He flexed the muscles of his powerful arms and he smote himself mighty blows upon his brow and chest and stomach．

“Ho，councilors！”roared Hunder，“bring me my sheep and my pie and my chocolate，for I have a vast hunger．”

The people fled from the streets，and behind the barred doors and shuttered windows of their houses they listened and trembled．The baker，the butcher，and the candymaker hid under their beds．They had prepared no meal for the giant and they were afraid for their lives．But the brave little toy-maker，his white hair flowing like the dandelion clock in the morning wind，ran through the cobbled streets and across the green valley and stood at the giant's feet．

“Behold，I am still a whole man！”bellowed the giant，thumping his brow．“I have heard the word and I have seen the black chimneys，but I have not beheld the blue men．”

“That is well，”said Quillow，“for he who beholds the blue men must bathe in the yellow waters in the middle of the sea，or else he will dwindle，first to the height of the pussy willow，then to the height of the daffodil，then to the height of the violet，until finally he becomes a small voice in the grass，lost in the thundering of the crickets．”

“But I shall remain stronger than the rock and taller than the oak，”said Hunder，and he clapped his hands together．

“If you are stronger than the rock and taller than the oak，”said Quillow，“then stamp on the ground and make yonder cow in the field turn a flip-flop．”

Hunder stood up and chortled with glee．“Behold，smallest of men，”he said，“I will make the cow turn twice in the air．”He brought his right foot down upon the earth sharply and heavily．The cow turned a double flip-flop in the field，Quillow bounced as high as the giant's belt，and great boughs fell from trees．But the giant had no eyes for these familiar wonders．He stared at something new under the sun，new and small and terrible．The blue men had come．The blue men were popping high into the air．They popped up in the valley and they popped up in the woods．They popped up from behind stones and they popped up from behind cowslips．They popped up in front of Hunder and they popped up behind him and under him and all around him．

“The blue men！”cried Hunder．“The blue men have come！ The world is filled with little blue men！”

“I see no blue men，”said Quillow，“but you have begun to shrink like the brook in dry weather，and that is the sign of the third symptom．”

“The sea！ The sea！ Point me to the sea！”bellowed Hunder，who now stood shivering and shaking．

“It is many leagues to the east，”said Quillow．“Run quickly toward the rising sun and bathe in the yellow waters in the middle of the sea．”

Hunder the giant ran toward the rising sun，and the town trembled as he ran．Pictures fell from walls and plates from plate rails and bricks from chimneys．The birds flew and the rabbits scampered．The cows turned flip-flops in the fields and the brook jumped out of its bed．





Ⅵ


A fortnight later a traveler from afar，stopping at the Sign of the Clock and Soldier，told the innkeeper a marvelous tale of how a giant，panting and moaning like a forest on fire，had stumbled down out of the mountains and plunged into the sea，flailing and threshing，and babbling of yellow waters and black chimneys and little blue men；and of how he had floundered farther and farther out to sea until at last he sank beneath the waves，starting a mighty tide rolling to the shore and sending up water spouts as high as the heavens．Then the giant was seen no more，and the troubled waters quieted as the sea resumed its inscrutable cycle of tides under the sun and the moon．

The innkeeper told this tale to the blacksmith，and the blacksmith told it to the locksmith，and the locksmith told it to the baker，and the baker told it to the butcher，and the butcher told it to the tailor，and the tailor told it to the cobbler，and the cobbler told it to the candymaker，and the candymaker told it to the candlemaker，and the candlemaker told it to the town crier，and the town crier told it to the lamplighter，and the lamplighter told it to the toymaker．

As the lamplighter spoke，Quillow put the finishing touches on a new toy，whistling softly，his eyes sparkling．

The lamplighter saw that the toy was a tiny replica of Quillow himself．

“What do you do with that？”he asked．

“You put it in the palm of your hand，like this，”said Quillow，and he put the figure in the palm of his hand．“And then you blow，like this．”He blew，and the miniature Quillow floated slowly through the air and drifted gently to the floor．“I think it will amuse the children，”said the little toymaker．“I got the idea from a giant．”





The White Deer


The Magical Forest


If you should walk and wind and wander far enough on one of those afternoons in April when smoke goes down instead of up，and nearby things sound far away and far things near，you are more than likely to come at last to the enchanted forest that lies between the Moonstone Mines and Centaurs Mountains．You'll know the woods when you are still a long way off by virtue of a fragrance you can never quite forget and never quite remember．And there'll be a distant bell that causes boys to run and laugh and girls to stand and tremble．If you pluck one of the ten thousand toadstools that grow in the emerald grass at the edge of the wonderful woods，it will feel as heavy as a hammer in your hand，but if you let it go it will sail away over the trees like a tiny parachute，trailing black and purple stars．

There's even a tale，first told by minstrels in the medieval time，that rabbits here can tip their heads as men now tip their hats，removing them with their paws and putting them back again．

This enchanted forest was once upon a time a part of the kingdom of a mighty monarch named Clode，who had three sons，Thag，Gallow and Jorn．Thag and Gallow，like their father，King Clode，were great hunters，and when they were not eating or sleeping they were engaged in the chase．Jorn，the youngest and shortest of the Princes—he was only six feet tall—was a poet and musician，and when he was not at table or in bed，he was fond of setting his verses to the music of the lyre．He occasionally took part in the hunt when his father and brothers insisted，but he was careful to loose his arrows and cast his lances clear of whatever quarry the royal family might be pursuing．

Three times in the middle of the century in which they lived，the King and his two older sons had depleted their kingdom of wild life，and three times they had been forced to wait around the castle，restlessly stringing their bows，feathering their arrows and sharpening their lances，until a new generation of deer and wild boar could come to maturity in the fields and forests．King Clode and Thag and Gallow ate oftener，drank more，and slept longer during these tedious periods of inactivity，and they fell to buffeting and plaguing the members of their retinue，particularly a dwarf named Quondo，and the Royal Wizard，a castle wizard whose magic consisted chiefly of sleight-of-hand and juggling，since he was not privy to the secrets of the woods wizards who lived in the enchanted forest．

Jorn found these seasons serene，and spent his time singing of a faraway Princess who would one day set a perilous labor for each of the Princes to perform．He sang that love，not might，would untie the magic knot，or open the mystic lock，or hoodwink the dreadful dragon or resolve whatever other problem the faraway Princess might propose as the key to her heart and hand．Thag and Gallow guffawed at their younger brother's “finickery”as they called it，and they would take to tossing Quondo，the dwarf，back and forth in the air as if he were a ball，oblivious of his guttural protests．The older brothers knew better than to put upon Jorn for he had more than once taken falls from them in wrestling，and he could hold his own at tilting on horseback．

One night when the third period of waiting for the boar and the deer to venture abroad still had a hundred moons to run，King Clode told a tale to his sons，over his tankards，while Jorn strummed softly on his lyre and Quondo sat in a dark corner of the banquet hall，under a great shield，nursing his scars and bruises．

“There is always the enchanted forest to hunt，”Prince Thag had growled at supper time，testing the string of a long bow．

“There is always the enchanted forest to shun，”King Clode had roared，and he went on to tell of how he had once dared to chase a fleet deer in the magic woods with his own father and two brothers，and how they had brought the deer to bay against the sheer wall of Centaurs Mountain，and how as they made ready to launch their arrows，the deer had been transformed into a tall，dark young princess，who had been changed into a deer years before by a wicked old woman jealous of the young girl's beauty．

“There we were，”went on King Clode，“your grandfather，King Bode，and his three sons—your Uncle Cloon，your Uncle Garf and myself—feeling like sheep in our chagrin and dismay，or like a mastiff that goes growling boldly into a wolf's den and comes upon a pink-eyed female rabbit．One of those grinning woods wizards came along presently and conjured up a white palfrey for the Princess—out of thin air，as I remember—and we rode off to the castle．

“We gave the Princess food and wine and a pillow for her head，and on the following day we set off in full panoply and jingling trappings to carry her to her father，a king whose lands lay far to the north．We jingled through apple blossoms，as we started out，for it was May，and we jingled through snowflakes when we neared her ancestral castle．Her father and mother were overjoyed to see their daughter again and her father the King set a series of passable tables in honor of the occasion，although to my taste the wines of the North smack a bit of buckle polish，or lance oil，it may be—this was many years ago．”

“Why have you never told—”said Thag．

“—this tale before？”said Gallow．

“You were too young，”said Clode，“for such a tale as might offend the growing heart….Where was I？”

“This was many years ago，”Thag prompted．

“Ah，yes，”said Clode．“Well，your grandfather and your uncles and I were eager to set off for home and the chase．The Princess' father was a fellow of small fancies，with an indoor turn of mind，given to dawdling over the chess board even in the keenest hunting weather，drinking a warmish wassail full of aloes or something．

“We were not to get off as soon or as easy as we thought．There was the infernal custom of the country whereby a rescued princess exercises the privilege of claiming one of her rescuers as her husband．She was a pretty enough gray-eyed minx but she was fond of the harp and the spinner，with no stomach for the chase，and a way of fluttering up behind a man before he knew it，moving like a cat on velvet．

“The upshot was that your grandfather rode home alone and the Princess set Cloon and Garf and myself each a perilous labor．Cloon was to bring back the golden right wing of the great Falcon of Ferralane．Garf，an uncouth varlet at best，though an angel in the saddle，was sent to bring back a drop of blood from the right index finger of a hundred kings，an adventure which could not conceivably be concluded within the life span of the human being；and I was told off to fetch the Princess an enormous diamond said to lie between the paws of a fearful creature，half dragon and half roc，in the cave of a mountain not many leagues distant．”

King Clode filled up two tankards from a bowl of wine on the table before him and drank them off．

“You were too young to remember，”he continued，“but a traveler from faraway Ferralane passed this way some twenty years ago with the news that your Uncle Cloon was bested in his struggle with the great Falcon whose left wing，it transpired during the battle，was made of edged and pointed steel．Your Uncle Garf has never been heard from to this day，which is reasonable enough in view of estimates arrived at by my Royal Recorder，who has figured that it requires ninety-seven years to procure a drop of blood from the right index finger of a hundred kings．”

While the King filled his tankards again with wine，Prince Jorn strummed a sorrowful song on his lyre．

“To make a rather distressing story short，”resumed King Clode，“the monster I was dispatched to overcome proved to be made of clay and boxwood，so that it was the simplest of tasks to deprive the creature of the enormous diamond clutched between its artificial paws．I delivered the stone to the Princess and won her hand in marriage，having already won the fair lady's heart，as even Quondo there can see．”

The King sat back in his great chair and closed his eyes．

“And the moral of this tale，”grumbled Quondo，“is precisely what？”

The King opened one eye．“The moral of this tale，”he said，“is precisely never hunt deer in the enchanted forest．”

Thag and Gallow，who had sat staring at their father through his recital，looked at each other and at the King again．

“We do not like it，”said Thag．

“Our mother having once been a deer！”said Gallow．

Jorn spoke for the first time．“It was but the illusory and meaningless shape of magic，”he said，and returned to his music．

“The boy has it，”roared King Clode．“It was as he says—meaningless magic．”He tapped a tankard on the table top．“Never quite got used to it，though，”he admitted at last．“Don't suppose a hunting man ever could．”There was a long and thoughtful silence before Clode spoke again．“She took to her chamber of a mortal malady shortly after Jorn was born，and never set foot on the stair again．”

“Perhaps she died of a fall，”said Thag．

“Perhaps she died of a surfeit，”said Gallow．

“Perhaps she died of a look，”said Jorn．

The King hurled a tankard at the youngest Prince and Jorn caught it in mid-air．

“Has his mother's quickness and his mother's grace，”muttered Clode．He sighed．“Well，there is a tale．”

The Royal High Chamberlain's voice spoke suddenly behind Clode's chair，and the King started slightly．“Must I have men who creep about like cats？”roared Clode．

“There is a minstrel，Sire，”the Royal High Chamberlain said．

“Then send him in，then send him in！”cried Clode．“He'll sing to us of strong men and the chase．I've had enough of sorrow and of love．”He glared at Jorn．

The minstrel entered softly and sat upon a stool and strummed his lute and sang．He sang of white deer，a white deer with the speed of light，a white deer as lovely to look upon as a waterfall in springtime．

When the song was done，the King asked，“Is this deer as swift as light and as lovely as a waterfall in springtime a creature of your silly fancy，or does it have breath and blood that I and my sons may test its speed and strength？”

The minstrel sang：

“The white deer flashes like the light

Through the forest day and night．”

“Name me the name of this forest，”roared the King．

The minstrel sang：

“By night and day the white deer shines

Betwixt the Mountain and the Mines．”

At this King Clode rose from his chair，upsetting a tankard of red wine that spilled onto the floor．“You bound the enchanted forest with your infernal rhyme！”he cried．“No man of King Clode's household hunts in those accursed woods！”

The minstrel sang：

“Too swift for Thag，too quick for Gallow，

Too strong for young Prince Jorn to follow，

But foot of turtle，heart of toad

Never shall be spoke of Clode．”

The King pulled at his long black mustaches and a light flickered in his eye and went out and flickered again like the light of a firefly．“Mayhap，”he said at last，“this white deer with the speed of light is a true deer．We shall test its vaunted prowess on the morrow．If it be a true deer，I shall hang its head upon the wall and its meat in the larder．If it be a lovely maiden enchanted by some witch's or wizard's spell，the daughter of some king whose lands lie to the north or east or south or west，I shall drive my lance and arrow through this foolish minstrel's heart！”

King Clode pounded a tankard on the table to accent each word of his ominous warning，but when he looked around，the minstrel had disappeared．King Clode frowned．“Fellow bore a remarkable resemblance to somebody or other I have encountered somewhere or other，”he muttered．

“If this be a true deer，”said Thag，“we shall enjoy the greatest chase in history．”

“If this be a true deer，”said Gallow，“we shall hang the finest venison in all the world．”

The King's eyes gleamed as he swallowed a great apricot．

“And if this be a true Princess of the royal blood？”It was the rumbling voice of Quondo，the dwarf，speaking from his corner．The King hurled an apple at the dwarf，but Jorn caught it in the air．

“If this be a true Princess of the royal blood，”Jorn said，“she shall set the sons of Clode each a perilous labor to find the Prince most worthy of her heart and hand．”

At this，to show their strength，Thag caught up a heavy iron from the fireplace and bent it double，and Gallow turned a double handspring down the floor．Jorn watched his brothers and stroked the strings of his lyre．The King tugged at his mustaches，his eyes burning with dreams of the chase．Quondo sat in his corner under the shield，watching Clode and Thag and Gallow，and listening to the music of Jorn's lyre．

The next morning as the sun was rising，the King and his three sons，riding on black chargers，entered the enchanted forest，reined in and gazed about them．

“Pick not that buttercup，”said Clode，pointing a leathery finger at a small flower in the emerald grass，“or it will turn to flame and burn your hand．”

“Do not pluck the lichen from that tree，”said Thag，“or it will turn to blood and stain your hand．”

“Do not touch that white stone there，”said Gallow，“or it will come alive and bite your hand．”

There was thunder suddenly from behind the Moonstone Mines，the sun went out，a flash of lightning made the four horses tremble and in the darkness all around the King and his sons glimmered a million fireflies．

While Clode and his sons gazed at the shimmering dance in amazement，the fireflies changed to snowflakes which fell softly to the earth and disappeared．The thunder ceased，the clouds parted and the sun came out again．

“These constant tricks upon the eye are bad for man's digestion，”said King Clode．“I shall have no stomach for the finest meat on earth if this false flux of fact and form does not desist．”

“What's hot is cold，”said Thag．

“What's hard is soft，”said Gallow．

“What's night is day，”said Clode．

Jorn，who had been thinking up a verse during the show of marvels，recited it：

“What's black is white，

What's red is blue，

What's dark is light，

What's true is true．”

“Well rhymed，Prince Jorn，”said a voice that seemed to come from nowhere until the King and his sons looked down and saw a woods wizard in a blue robe and a red peaked cap．

“Ho，”said the King，glaring at the wizard，“have I not seen you otherwhere than here？”

“You have seen me otherwhere than now，”said the sorcerer，plucking a pansy and tossing it into the air where it became a butterfly and fluttered away through the trees．

“I have ridden in these woods but once before，”said King Clode．

“Twenty-six years，twenty-five days and twenty-four hours ago，”said the wizard．

“My father and my brothers and I pursued a deer，”said Clode，“which against the wall of Centaurs Mountain underwent a marvelous and mortifying metamorphosis．I am a little touchy on the topic，too，so do not turn your tongue to taunts．”

“He does not turn his tongue，”said Jorn．“He twists your own，to ‘m's’ and ‘t's.’”

“And ‘w's，’”said the wizard，“as you shall see．”

“Try twice that trick on Tlode，”said the King，with great dignity，“my mousey man of magic，and we will wid these wids of woozards．”King Clode made a royal gesture of arrogance，authority and austerity，while his sons stared at him in astonishment．

“You speak magic words，O Clode，”said the wizard，smugly，removing his cap and bowing deeply．“And now may I be of service to you and the Princes Thag and Gallow and Jorn？ May I show you the barking tree，or the musical mud，or the wingless birds？”

The King grimaced at this list of wonders and Prince Jorn answered the wizard．“My father seeks the white deer，”he said，“the white deer swift as light and lovely as a waterfall in springtime．”

The wizard bowed again and flung his cap in the air．“What goes up must not come down，”he said，and the cap，swinging slowly like a bell，sailed silently over the trees，rising higher and higher until finally it could be seen no more．

“What comes down must go up，”said the wizard，and he wiggled three fingers of his left hand toward the ground．Suddenly the snowflakes that had melted and vanished began to rise from the earth and when they were as high as the wizard's heart，they changed into a million fireflies．The King and his sons watched in wonder and for a moment four horses and four men were as still as statues in amazement，for through the glow and glimmer and gleam there suddenly flashed a white deer as swift as light and as lovely as a waterfall in springtime．

“Hoy，yollo！”cried the King，and he and his sons were off in pursuit，the sparks from their horses’ hoofs joining in the dance of the fireflies．

The white deer flashed through the green forest and the King and his sons followed，past the barking tree，across the musical mud，in and out of a flock of wingless birds．On and on went the chase until the sun began to set and long strange shadows fell．The white deer led its pursuers through a silver swamp and a bronze bog and a golden glade，its speed still swift as light．It shot like an arrow through a fiery fen and over misty moor．It climbed a ruby ridge，flung across a valley of violets，and sped along the pearly path leading to the myriad mazes of the Moonstone Mines．

Twenty hoofs thundered hotly through a haunted hollow of spectral sycamores hung with lighted lanterns and past a turquoise tarn and along an avenue of asphodel that turned and twisted down a dark descent which led at last to a pale and perilous plain．The setting sun sank into the sea，seven stars shone suddenly in the sky，and the white deer's dreadful day was done，its race was run，for now it stood silent and still and shivering under the mighty crag called Centaurs Mountain．

King Clode and Princes Thag and Gallow prepared to loose their arrows，and Jorn closed his eyes against the sight．When he opened them a moment later，the royal huntsmen had dropped their bows and arrows to the earth to stare，not at a deer at bay，but at a tall and dark and youthful maiden，a veritable princess，clad in a long white satin robe，the sparkle of jewels in her hair，golden sandals upon her feet，her red lips parted prettily，her dark eyes shining．

Four horses raised eight ears in sharp surprise，three Princes fell upon their knees at the maiden's feet，and the King glowered and tugged at his mustaches．

“As royal a run as any king could know，”he growled，“and it ends as always in vanished venison and a lovely lady to carry to her kingdom．Pray God her father has a decent taste in wines！”

But when young Jorn，who alone of the Princes could find his tongue，asked the maiden to name her name and tell her kingdom，she could only shake her head and say she did not know．

King Clode sighed．“Swing her to your saddle，Jorn，”he said，“and we will serve her at our table in another way than I had hoped．Make haste before that wicked woods wizard shows up to make sport of us all．”

Prince Jorn lifted the Princess to his saddle and the jingle of the harness bells and buckles sounded like merry laughter in King Clode's ears as he whirled his horse about and they began the long ride home across the pale and perilous plain，up the dark descent，along the avenue of asphodel，past the turquoise tarn，through the haunted hollow of spectral sycamores hung with lighted lanterns，in and out of the myriad mazes of the Moonstone Mines，along the pearly path，across the valley of violets，over the ruby ridge and the misty moor，through the fiery fen and the golden glade and the bronze bog and the silver swamp，in and out of the flock of wingless birds，across the musical mud，past the barking tree and through the green forest and the shimmering fireflies and out at last upon the open road that led straight to the castle．





The Lost Princess


The next morning the Princess sat in an eastern room，and watched the sunlight，falling through slits and circles in the ancient castle wall，make small bright patterns on the cold stone floor．

The Royal Wizard，a wizard，as we have said，of meager devices，juggled seven silver spheres for the entertainment of the Princess，while Quondo sat in the corner and watched first the silver spheres and then the dark bewildered eyes of the lovely maiden．She had lain awake most of the night trying in vain to remember her name and the name of her father．

On the floor at her feet，the Royal Recorder sat cross-legged，chanting the names of kings from a ponderous ledger in the hope that one of them might light a light in the lady's eyes．He had reached the P's and droned steadily on…．“Paq，Pardo，Payorel，Pent，Perril，Peo，Pilligro．Piv，Podo，Polonel，Puggy．”At the name “Puggy，”the Princess started slightly—but only because the Royal Wizard had dropped one of the silver spheres．Quondo picked it up and tossed it back to him．

The Royal Recorder made a series of sounds with his tongue and teeth．“King Puggy，”he said，disapprovingly，“is the most disreputable king in the whole Registry of Kings．He lives in a ruined castle on a hill with his seven madcap daughters．The old king's wife died of a fit of shrieks when all the Princesses were very young．Now Puggy and his seven maids live all alone，wreaking every kind of hob and havoc on their hills：rolling boulders down on passersby，turning rivers from their normal course，stealing gems and silks from caravans so they can dress in gawdy masquerade and play their wild and eerie games by jack-o'-lantern light．”The Royal Recorder raised his hands and shook his head．“Every night is Hallowe'en on Puggy's Hill．”

The Princess frowned and turned a little pale．The Royal Recorder sighed again and read more names，glancing at the Princess after every name，but she gave no signs of recognition．He ran on，through twenty Q's and thirty R's and forty S's and ten T's and five U's and two V's and thirteen W's and ninety X's and fifty-six Y's and came at last to the Z's．“Zar，”he said，and the Princess jumped in her chair，but only because the Royal Wizard had dropped another silver sphere．Quondo tossed it back to him and the juggling and the droning continued：“Zaro，Zat，Zawazaw，Zav，Zax，Zay，Zazir，Zazuno，Zyzz，”chanted the Recorder，and he closed the record of royalty with a dusty thump，shook his head sadly and stood up．

The Wizard let the silver spheres drop into a wide pocket of his long robe．Quondo gazed softly at the Princess．

“I have a memory of trees and fields and a memory of nothing more，”she sighed．

“This presents a problem for a practitioner of physic，”said the Royal Recorder，“but unhappily，the Royal Physician is quite ill of some mysterious malady and has given orders that he must not be disturbed．”The Princess studied with troubled eyes a pattern of crenelated shadow on the floor．“There is，to be sure，the Royal Clockmaker．He has made several shrewd surmises in his time．Tocko，the Clockmaker，”he added，“was formerly the Royal Astronomer．”The Princess took her kerchief and wiped a ledger smudge from the Royal Recorder's cheek．

“Why is Tocko no longer the Royal Astronomer？”she asked．

“He got so old he could not see the planets very well，or even the moon or even the sun，”said the Recorder．“His constant reports that everything was going out alarmed King Clode，who must have light to hunt by，as you know—and no offense intended．”

The Princess smiled faintly．

The Recorder went on．“‘Let me have men in my towers who bring me news of bright sun and stars！’King Clode then cried．So Tocko was set to making clocks and chimes and sundials，and a younger man named Paz now scans the skies．He has invented rose-colored lenses for his telescope so even the palest moon and coldest star turn red and deep，and it is thus reported to the King．Let us visit the shadowy shop of ancient Tocko and hear what we may hear．”

They found Tocko in his shop carving a legend on a sundial：“After this brief light，the unending dark．”The old man's eyes were so dim and a hundred clocks ticked and chimed so loudly that he was not aware of his visitors．The Princess read the legend carved on another sundial：“It is darker than you think，”and on a third：“This little light and the night．”The Royal Recorder tapped the ancient Clockmaker on his shoulder，and Tocko looked up with pale and misty eyes．

“I bring a nameless Princess，”said the Royal Recorder，“who has a memory of trees and fields and a memory of nothing more．”He cupped his hand close to the old man's ear and told the tale of the white deer and of how it had been transformed into a tall and dark and lovely Princess at the foot of Centaurs Mountain，and of how he had read out all the names of kings in the Royal Register without lighting a light in the eyes of the Princess．“You were ever a man of shrewd surmises and gifted guesses，”concluded the Royal Recorder．“What say you ails the lady？”

The Clockmaker waved the long thin fingers of one hand．“Send the lady to walk in the gardens，”he said，“where the silver fountains play，the while I hazard a few hazards as to what has happened to her head．”The hands of the hundred clocks pointed to noon but the clocks chimed eight and six and nine and four and all the other hours but twelve．“Maidens have a strange effect on clocks，”said Tocko，“causing them to strike too little or too long，making a travesty of time．”The Royal Recorder led the Princess to the door and showed her the gardens where the silver fountains played，and he watched her until she moved among them，lovely but forlorn，beyond the sound of clocks and voices．

“Perhaps she had a fall and struck a stone，”said the Recorder，“and in this wise lost her memory．”The old man shook his head．“Perhaps she drank a potion or a philter，”said the Recorder，“and in this wise lost her memory．”The old man shook his head again and said，“You asked me to assume assumption，and you assume assumptions of your own．”The Recorder said that he was sorry，and listened in silence while the old man spoke．

“I mind a tale my father told a hundred years ago or thereabouts，”said Tocko，“a marvelous tale of a true deer who befriended a woods wizard．It seems this woods wizard in the olden time had a fall or drank a potion or a philter and tumbled senseless in a stream in April when streams are swift and strong．The tale tells how a passing deer plucked the senseless wizard from the stream and saved his life．In return for this good and timely deed，he gave the deer the power of changing to a Princess，tall and dark and lovely，in the event that hunters pressed it hard and there was nowhere to flee，as when a deer is brought to bay at Centaurs Mountain．”

The Recorder's eyes grew large and round and his mouth fell open．In the pause that followed，the hundred clocks，whose hands pointed to eleven minutes after noon，struck thirteen times．When the chiming ceased，the Recorder spoke．“Do you mean to tell me，Tocko，that this Princess is in all save shape and semblance a true deer and not a Princess of the royal blood？”

“In due course，”pursued the old man，“the deer I speak of in the ancient time was hotly pressed by some hobbledehoy of the region，unaccountably skillful in the saddle，and brought to bay against a crag too steep to climb．As the hunter raised his bow，the panting wild-eyed deer became before his goggling eyes a Princess in all seeming，tall and dark and lovely．The hobbledehoy turned white and red and blue and rode off as fast as his spent horse could travel，leaving his bow and arrow on the ground．

“The deer in maiden's guise made its way to the cave of the woods wizard it had befriended and put to him a quavering question：how could it remain a maiden and live in the manner of a maiden？ The wizard，out of his old gratitude，gave the deer the power of remaining a maiden，in shape and semblance，until such time as love should fail her thrice．If love should fail her thrice，then she must resume her true form forever and forever，come what may．

“The first to love her was a poet，the second was a minstrel，the third was a knight．Each in his turn discovered her true nature and each in his turn failed of his love．For who can love a lady who is in reality a deer？”

There was for a long moment only the ticking of the clocks and the faint sound of the fountains．

“And in the end，”asked the Royal Recorder，“when love had failed her thrice？”

“In the end，when love had failed her thrice，”Tocko said，“she was instantly changed back into her true and proper form．A fortnight later she was hard pressed by the same hobbledehoy who had pursued her before．This time his arrow found her heart．”

The clocks all of a sudden struck seven．“Is this a truth you tell me？”demanded the Recorder．

“The white deer of my father's time knew not her name，for wild deer have no names．She had a memory of trees and fields and a memory of nothing more，”old Tocko said．

“How can I tell this tale to Clode，the proudest hunter of his day？”the Royal Recorder cried．“I beg you，Tocko，doubt your doubts and hope some hopes this Princess may be real．”

The old man coughed．“Against the may，the could be，and the should，folly 'tis to balance doubt or hope．I know the symbols，signs and symptoms of a thousand spells．Sorceries run in cycles．”

Neither the old man nor the younger observed a dark form in a gloomy corner of the shop．It was the squatty figure of Quondo who had crept in，unnoticed．His eyes were closed that they might not sparkle and be seen，but he was not asleep．The Royal Recorder turned without a word，opened the heavy oaken door and went out．

He watched the lovely Princess walk toward him，the sparkle of jewels in her hair，golden sandals on her feet，and he marveled that a deer，if this was indeed a deer，could take so perfectly the shining semblance of a lady of royal blood．The Royal Recorder wondered if he could truly love a lady who might at this time or that，depending on the special spell that held her in enchantment，begin to nibble at the young leaves on the trees．He decided with a sigh and a shake of his head that he could not，and made a little note to this effect in the archives of his heart．

There were question marks in the dark eyes of the nameless maid，but the Royal Recorder shook his head and looked away and sighed．“The old man moaned and maundered，murmured，muttered，mumbled odds of this and ends of that，bits and pieces，shreds and edges，full of ifs and whens and theres and thens，amounting in the end and all to six times less than nothing．”

He bowed and sighed and bowed again and watched the Princess cross the grass like summer rain and vanish through a portal．

It was a silent meal that noon in the long banquet hall which was so dark even in the daytime that torches flared from iron scones on the heavy stone walls．The mysterious maiden ate several walnuts，refused wine，and nibbled at a leaf of lettuce in such a way as to remind the uncomfortable King and his older sons of the previous day in the enchanted forest and their swift and surprising quarry．Clode and Thag and Gallow stirred restlessly in their chairs and grunted now and then．Prince Jorn，whose fond eyes betrayed his feeling for the nameless Princess，was pleased to see that she regarded him softly whenever she raised her own eyes to look down the table．Quondo，the dwarf，once more in his corner under the iron shield，missed no glance or grunt．His dark eyes never left the figures at the table．

“If you do not eat better than this，”said the King to the Princess，“I shall have to consult the Royal Gamekeeper．I mean，”he hastily corrected himself，“the Royal Physician．”The princess turned a pretty pink，Jorn scowled at his father，and the King，to cover his confusion，bawled for the Royal Wizard，who appeared suddenly in a cloud of smoke．

“I thought I told you not to appear in a cloud of smoke any more，”growled the King．“The smell of powder spoils the fragrance of the wine．I told you that．”

“I forgot，”said the Wizard．

“Just come in the room like anybody else，”said the King．

“Yes，Sire，”said the Wizard，and he began to juggle seven little crescent moons made of gold and silver．

The King continued to grumble to himself．“Bad enough when he used to appear in a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder．Worse now when he smells up the whole castle．Fellow's foolish tricks do not justify such an elaborate entrance．Average woods wizard knows more in one day than this buffoon learns in ten years，spite of the fact he attended one of the most expensive schools for sorcerers in the world．Bah！ Can't teach a man to ride a horse or cast a spell．Comes naturally or it doesn't come at all．”

Muttering and pulling at his mustaches，King Clode drank off a goblet of white wine，got up from the table and went up the winding stone stair．He was still talking to himself，and his voice echoed hollowly through castle halls and chambers：“I'll purge this lovely lady of her namelessness or eat an uncooked horse．”He listened at the door of the chamber where the Royal Physician lay in bed，alternately groaning and comforting himself：

“I'll never walk again…．Come，come，we'll have us out of bed in no time；we'll bring the roses to those cheeks of ours in no time…．No，we won't…Yes，we will… No，we won't… Yes，we will．”

A long silence followed and the King entered the chamber．The Royal Physician was taking his temperature，but he shook the mercury down without looking at it．

“As a physician，I must take my temperature every three hours，”he said，“but as a patient，I must not be told what it is．”

“Nobody ever tells me what anything is，”said the King，who did not know what the Royal Physician was talking about．“I came to speak to you as a physician，not as a patient．”

“I do not believe I can cure myself，”said the sick man．“Now，now，”he retorted to himself，“we mustn't lose faith in the skill of our physician，must we？”

The King sighed and went to a window and looked out on the castle grounds．He tugged at the lobe of his right ear with his left hand and told the tale of the white deer which he and his sons had pursued，and how it had become a tall，dark and lovely Princess who had a memory of trees and fields and a memory of nothing more．When he had finished the tale，he asked the Physician what he thought was wrong with the Princess that she could not remember her name or the name of her father．

“Perhaps she had a fall，”said the sick man，in his suave physician's voice，“or perhaps she drank a potion or a philter．”

“She had no bruise on her head，”said the King，“and the pupils of her eyes are not dilated．”

“Hm，”said the Royal Physician，“I must study the case when I get up，if I ever do，which I doubt．Roses in my cheeks，indeed！ I don't believe I have the slightest notion what is the matter with me… Come，come，we mustn't get ourself all worked up，must we？”

“I don't know，”said the bewildered King．He looked at the sick man，sighed，and left the chamber and went to his couch where he lay thrashing and muttering to himself for an hour．He got up at last and went heavily down the winding stone stair．

In the eastern chamber from which the sunlight had departed，the King found the Royal Wizard juggling the seven little moons and the seven silver spheres by the light of seventeen tall candles．The Royal Recorder was reciting the names of imaginary kings to the Princess，who sat in the same chair she had sat in during the morning when he had recited the names of real kings．“Rango，Rengo，Ringo，Rongo，Rungo，”chanted the Recorder．“Rappo，Reppo，Rippo，Roppo，Ruppo．”

The Royal Wizard dropped a moon and a sphere and complained that the flickering candlelight made it difficult to see．Quondo squatted in his corner，his dark eyes on the puzzled face of the Princess．

“Santo，Sento，Sinto，Sonto，Sunto，”droned the Recorder．“Talatar，Teletar，Tilitar，Tolotar，Tulutar．Undan，Unden，Undin，Undon，Undun．”

“What mummery goes forward here in the flickering light？”roared Clode．

“I am making up the names of kings in the hope that one of them may light a light in the eyes of the Princess，”said the Recorder．“Valalare，Veralare，Viralare，Voralare，Vuralare．Waxy，Wexy，Wixy，Woxy，Wuxy，”he intoned．

“Pap，Pep，Pip，Pop，Pup！”cried the King in disgust．“Enough of this Wixy，Waxy，Wuxy！ The lovely lady may be nameless，but any fool can see she is not the imaginary daughter of an imaginary monarch．I'll solve this pretty problem in the manner of a king，without a lot of this trrradiddle and tirradaddle．I ordain and decree here and now that the Princess shall set a perilous labor for each of my three sons，and the first who succeeds in his task shall marry the wench．Nothing like marriage to bring a woman to her senses．”

The eyes of the lost Princess grew bright as she thought of Jorn，then grave as she thought of Gallow，and then frightened as she thought of Thag．

“When the sun has reached the zenith on the morrow，”said Clode，“the lady shall name a perilous labor for each of my sons．I'll wager a cask of emeralds that Thag returns first from his mission．What man of you would risk as many gems on Gallow？”

There was a little silence，broken by the deep rumble of Quondo's voice．“A cask of emeralds，weight for weight，”he said，“that young Prince Jorn will wed the lady．”

King Clode's laughter shook the heavy walls．“Done and done，my stupid dwarf，”he bellowed．

The Princess rose，curtsied to the King，and walked from the chamber，followed by Quondo and the Wizard．As King Clode made to go，the Royal Recorder began in a quavering voice：“There is a tale that Tocko tells…”

“Tell me no tale that Tocko tells，”said the King．“The ancient ass reported comets which in truth were glowworms．His hundred clocks all chime by chance．He sets his sundials in the shade．Tell me no tale that Tocko tells．”

The Royal High Chamberlain entered the room without knocking，and bowed to the King．“The Royal Astronomer，Sire，”he said，“seeks an immediate audience．Something has gone amiss in the skies．”

“Send him in！ Send him in！”shouted Clode．“Don't stand there bowing and nodding your head—send him in！”

The Royal High Chamberlain bowed and nodded and withdrew．

“My father loved this flourish and formality，”said Clode．“I see no need for podgy go-betweens．If a man wants to come and see me，let him come and see me．”

There was a knock on the door and Paz，the Royal Astronomer，came into the room．He was a young pink-cheeked man in a pink robe and his pink eyes peered through pink lenses．

“A huge pink comet，Sire，”he said，“just barely missed the earth a little while ago．It made an awful hissing sound，like hot irons stuck in water．”

“They aim these things at me，”said Clode．“Everything is aimed at me．”He strode out of the room and slammed the door with such force that all the ledgers flew open and all their leaves fluttered in the wind．

The next day when the sun was at the zenith，the lost lady sat in a high carved golden chair in a great circular chamber reserved for royal ceremonies and commanded each of the three Princes in turn to fall on bended knee before her while the King and the Royal Recorder looked on．

The Princess spoke．“I commission you，Prince Thag，if you would win my hand，to hunt and kill with single lance and all alone，the great Blue Boar of Thedon Grove in the Forest of Jeopardy，and to bring its golden tusks to me and place them at my feet．”

“A hundred knights have lost their lives hunting the great Blue Boar of Thedon Grove in the Forest of Jeopardy！”cried Thag．

“Does great Prince Thag hunt nothing more perilous than white deer？”the Princess asked．Thag bowed，and kissed the maiden's hand，and a moment later the thunder of his horse's hoofs was heard in the circular chamber．

Gallow knelt in his turn．The Princess spoke．“I commission you，Prince Gallow，if you would win my hand，to overcome the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore which guards the Sacred Sword of Loralow，and to bring back the Sacred Sword of Loralow and place it at my feet．”

“A hundred knights have lost their lives striving to overcome the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore！”he cried．

“Does great Prince Gallow hunt nothing more perilous than white deer？”the Princess asked．Prince Gallow bowed，and kissed the maiden's hand，and a moment later the thunder of his horse's hoofs was heard in the circular chamber．

Jorn was the last to kneel．The Princess spoke．“I commission you，Prince Jorn，if you would win my heart and hand，to vanquish the Mok-Mok which guards the cherry trees in the Orchard of Chardor ten leagues from the castle gates，and to bring back a silver chalice filled with a thousand cherries and place it at my feet．”

King Clode leaned forward in his great oaken chair．“The Mok-Mok is a creature made of clay and sandalwood constructed by my father's father's father's father three hundred years ago to scare off rocs who used to strip the trees of cherries，”he cried．

“A hundred children have carved their names on the dreadful Mok-Mok in the cherry orchard of Chardor！”cried Jorn．

“Does the great Prince Jorn hunt nothing less perilous than white deer？”the Princess asked．

Jorn bowed，and kissed the maiden's hand，and a moment later the thunder of his horse's hoofs was heard in the circular chamber．

The Princess rose，curtsied to the King，and went up the winding stone stair to minister to the Royal Physician and to the Castle Wizard who，in trying to remove his own head and replace it，had succeeded only in straining his neck so that he had taken to his bed．

King Clode walked around the room，absently snapping the shields on the wall with his thumbnail and making them ring．“She has a lovely face，”he said．“I like the child．And yet I have the oddest feeling she is watching me in soft alarm，like a creature peering through the underbrush．”

The Royal Recorder put his right index finger alongside his nose．“Like a startled fawn，perhaps，trembling in the pussy willows？”he said．

The King whirled on him．“No，not like a startled fawn trembling in the pussy willows！”he snarled．“I slept lightly all night long，hearing every chirp and squeal and hoot and rustle，and something that kept going ‘clong！’off in that direction．”He pointed a little west of north．“I hear it every night．”

“They say the forest wizards bounce things off the moon．It could be that，”the Royal Recorder said．

The King sighed．“A thing went ticking through my thoughts a thousand times，”he said．“Tick，clong，tick，clong，tick，clong，went the night．”He strode toward the Royal Recorder．“What is this tale that Tocko tells？”he demanded．

The Royal Recorder coughed．“The tale that Tocko tells，”he said，“is tortuous and tortured．It has its balances，its noes and yeses，its this way，that way，its 'tis and 'tisn't，its can be，can't be，its six of one and half dozen of the other．”

“Babble，babble，babble，”said the King．“Blither，blither，blither．I have no time or mind for sophistries and riddles．Tocko's tales go round and round and make less sense than whirligigs．”

“I'll do my best，”the Royal Recorder said，and he told the tale of Tocko's father's deer，putting in a hundred twists and tangents of his own．

The King turned from pink to purple as he listened，and from purple to gray．When at last he found his voice，he croaked，“Pray God our deer is different from Tocko's father's deer．”

The Royal Recorder turned up the palms of his hands．

“Sorceries，as Tocko says，run in cycles．To put it another way，spells are set in sets and systems．What's true of one peculiar case is true of all peculiar cases of the same peculiar sort．If some knave had not removed my History of Sorcery from its proper shelf，I could show you what I mean．The History was compiled by your father's Recorder，and your father's Recorder's father's father．It has no index and no glossary，and it's both dog-eared and foxed．”

“What's ‘foxed’？”asked Clode．

“The History of Sorcery，”said the Royal Recorder．“Aren't you listening？”

“I want to know what ‘foxed’ means！”bawled Clode．

“Oh，spotted，”said the Recorder．

“Oh，‘spotted’！”mimicked the King．“It just happens that I have the History of Sorcery in my chamber．I've been reading it at night when I couldn't sleep．”He clapped his hands and a small man in yellow appeared，and Clode instructed him to go to the Royal bedchamber and bring down the History．“Get three men to help you，”said Clode．

“Persons removing the History of Sorcery or other volumes from the Royal Library should fill out the proper form，”said the Royal Recorder stiffly．

“I won't be listed and labeled or tabbed and tagged，”said Clode．“If I want a book，I'll get a book．”

The King and the Royal Recorder began to pace up and down the room in opposite directions，grunting and sighing，respectively，as they passed each other．Presently four small men in yellow came into the room stooping and staggering under the weight of an ancient and enormous volume on Sorcery．They set it down on the floor and left the room and the Royal Recorder began to turn the yellow dusty pages，squinting and coughing．

“There's nothing under Deer，”he said at last，“except the record and report of maidens changed to deer and back again，all nice and neat and normal，all neat and nice and formal．In every single case the disenchanted lady knew her name．It says so here．”

“Look under something else then！”roared the King．

“Such as？”the Royal Recorder asked．“For instance and example？”

“Look under Loss of Maidens' Memory！”bawled Clode．“Look under L！”

“Loss in this especial case comes under M，”the Royal Recorder said．

“How does and can and could it？”thundered Clode．

The Royal Recorder's voice was prim and firm．“The proper listing，Sire，is colon，quote，Memory，Maidens’，Loss of，stop，unquote．”

The King closed his left eye and then opened it and closed his right eye．His voice was low and ominous．“I do not have the slightest doubt that Pussycat comes under Q and Monkey-muddle under R and Donkey-daddle under S．Look up the sorry secret of this nameless child under X or Y or Z，but look it up！”The shields on the wall trembled．

The Royal Recorder turned to the M's and ran through Magic，Miracle，Mystery，and Mumps before he found at last what he was looking for，wedged in between Mice and Mountebank．The King paced up and down while the Recorder read a dozen pages，exclaiming “ah”and “oh”and “oh”and “ah”until King Clode shouted，“Stop your whinkering and read me what it says．”

The Royal Recorder shook his head．“You'd just get mad．It's full of clauses and phrases and pauses，and marginal notes and inner quotes，and words in Latin and words in Greek，viz．and ibid．and circa and sic．”

“Sum it up，then sum it up，”roared Clode，“in language workaday and commonplace，without a lot of twaddle-twee and tweedle-twa．”

The Royal Recorder flushed．“We have here under M，”he said，“the tale of nine enchantments in which a deer of the woods and fields was changed into a woman．”

“Why were they？”demanded Clode．

The Royal Recorder spoke slowly and patiently．“One：because the deer had saved a wizard's life．Two：because the wicked wizard wished to play a woeful prank on men．”

“If I were King of all the world，”said Clode，“I'd make an end of scorcery or break my backbone in the try．In such confusion and caprice who knows his hound dog from his niece？”

“Two things are true，”the Royal Recorder said，“in all these nine enchantments．First，the maidens had no names．They had a memory of trees and fields and a memory of nothing more．”

“Hah！”said Clode．

“Moreover，too，and furthermore，the spells were all the same．In every strange and single case herein set down and forth，the deer was chased and closely pressed and had nowhere to flee．”

“Ho！”said Clode．

“Whereupon，and then and there，the deer was changed into a maid，a tall and dark and lovely maid，a very Princess to the sight．”

“Hoy，”groaned Clode and he sat down heavily on a stool．

The Recorder walked up and down and stood still and raised his hand．“These false females，these mock maidens，these will-o'-the-wisp women，these pseudo-Princesses，have one disturbing power in common．”

“What power is this？”croaked Clode．

“Love them truly，love them well，nothing then can break the spell．”The Royal Recorder paused a moment and then went on．“But if love should fail them thrice，they would vanish in a trice．”

Clode jumped to his feet and strode up and down the chamber．“Take an edict，”he said at last．The Recorder found ink and a quill behind a cobweb on a shelf and drew a parchment from behind a shield and sat on the floor and crossed his legs．Clode closed his eyes and said，“Write it plain and write it clear：No son of mine shall wed a deer．”

“A deer in any form or figment，”said the Royal Recorder，“or guise or get-up，or shape or seeming，or image or effigy，or mockery or make-believe—”

“Who's issuing this edict？”demanded Clode．

The Recorder's voice was flat and firm．“It's far too clear，”he said．“It should be writ in such a way that if you ever changed your mind，the point could be disowned，denied and disavowed．”

“Erase the edict，”said the King．He looked sad for a moment，and then guffawed．“Our quandary has its sorrowful side indeed，yet half my kingdom would I give to see the face of Thag，the second huntsman of his time，waking to behold on the pillow next to his，the day the spell is broken，not raven locks and ruby lips but hairy ears and velvet nostrils！”

The force of the King's laughter caused him to bounce from wall to wall of the chamber like a ball in a box．His laughter and his bouncing increased as he thought of Gallow，and then of Jorn，face to face with the lady in her true form and substance，a creature of the fen and not the fireside，the bog，not the boudoir，the salt lick，not the silver bowl．

The King controlled himself long enough to say，“The thing that most amuses me in all this farce and fantasy's the thought of Jorn，Jorn of the lute and lyre，discovering he has won the heart and hoof of the swiftest deer in Christendom．”He sat down on a chair and rubbed the tears of merriment from his eyes．The Royal Recorder took a turn across the chamber and back again，stirring the candle flames．Clode sighed three times．“The damsel has lighted lights inside my heart—there's no denying that，”he said．“I wish I could decree she never was a deer．”

“You can't do that，”said the Royal Recorder．

“What can I do？”asked Clode．

“Wait and see what you shall see and watch what you shall watch，remembering that one is once and two is twice and three is thrice，and swifter than the twinkling is the trice．”

“Yammer，yammer，yammer，”said the King．“I've had my fill of yammering．We must advise this Princess she's a deer．Perhaps she'll have the grace to disappear．”

“She can't do that，”the shocked Recorder said．“By your decree the creature set a set of perils for your sons．She now awaits the swiftest one．The thing is simply done and done．”

“I thought she was a Princess at the time，”said Clode．

The Royal Recorder shrugged．“Insofar and inasmuch as your decree has made her such，she is a Princess，Sire，”he said．“De Facto and Pro Tem．”

The King raised his head and gave the great “Harrooo”of a lion tortured by magical mice．He strode so heavily to the door that the shields jangled on the wall．“I hope that all my sons get lost，”said Clode．“That's one way out．”

“It is for them，”the Royal Recorder said，“but not for you．You'd have the pretty creature on your hands until the day that great dark planet Tocko saw goes bump against the world and kills us all．”

King Clode sighed，and scowled，and snarled：“That was no great dark planet Tocko saw，but just a falling leaf or flying bird．Why must good King Clode be plagued by blind buffoons and dusty clowns and all the wicked wizards in the world？”

He rushed out of the room and slammed the door with such force that the wind blew the Royal Recorder flat on his face on the floor．





The Perilous Labor of Prince Thag


The road that Prince Thag followed dwindled to a zigzag path that zigzagged through a growth of gnarled and toppling trees like figures frozen in a dance．From all the trees a sticky thickish liquid dripped and oozed and gave or rather lent the air a heavy sweetish fragrance，for the sweetish heavy fragrance died and rose and died again and rose and died and rose again．

“This heavish sweety fragrance，”Thag muttered to himself，“that rises，or that roses，isn't fit for human noses，and it tricks the minds of men．Three times two is eight，”he said，“and one is ten．”

A furry bluish smoke came drifting through the trees in rings and hoops and collars．

“I distrust this stickish thicky stuff—”The tall Prince bit his lips．“Hag's thad enough．”

“A lozy moon globbers in the pipe trees，”said a voice in a tone which for one reason or another thaggravated Had．“I'm up here in the crouch of the tree，”the voice continued．

“Crotch，you mean，”said Thag，catching sight of a roundish balding man a few feet above him．

“On the contrary，”said the man，“crunch is what you meet in aching．”

“That's wince，”said Thag angrily．

“Mince is what you do to words，”the round man retorted．

“It's glibbers，in any case，”said Thag haughtily，“not globbers，as you said．The word is in the pleasant trense．”

“Ah，but you speak of mood，”said the round man．“I was referring to the moon．It is important to mind your D's and N's in these particular woods，which are not too particular，if you grasp me．”

“Nobody's grabbing you，”said Thag．He showed his upper teeth．“Furthermore，I resent your preferring to it as a ‘peasant trench.’”

The other stared down at Thag．“I don't care what you say，”he said coldly．“I say glibbers．”

High up in a tree，a chock climbed slowly．

“I wonder what type it is？”said Thag．

“It's sick thirsty，”said the man，“or half past hate or a quarter to fight．I'm in no moon for questions．”

“You're in no mood，”said Thag．

“First he accosts me，then he tells me what I'm not in，”said the man．“I crutch in the crouch of this tree to avoid troublemakers like you，riding on their nagamuffins．”

“You're thinking of ragmudgeons，”said Thag with dignity．

“Now he tells me what I'm thinking of，”said the man．

“And crouch is what you do，not where you are，”said Thag．

“How can I do anything where I am not？”asked the man．“I have half a mind to come down and trounce you．”

Thag laughed．

“That's right，”whined the man，“laugh at a man with only half a mind．”He sniffled．“A man with a crutch．”

“You crouch in a crotch，but you have no crutch，”said Thag．

The man burst into tears．“That's right，”he bawled，“laugh at a man because he has no crutch．”He shook his fist at Thag and cried，“A plague on both your horses！”

Four redbirds in a tangle bush sang “verti verti verti go”as Thag closed his mouth and held his breath and shut his eyes and galloped on through the stingish ringy smoke and the trickish sicky smell，and after a long moment he rode out of the growth of gnarled and toppling trees，and beheld before his eyes the shining Valley of Euphoria．

The air sparkled with the high fine sparkle of crystal which made the three men who approached Thag seem larger than they really were．The three men stood beside Thag's horse and bowed and smiled and bowed．Thag saw that each man held in his hand a mask exactly like his face，but the first mask was stern，the second mask was sad and the third mask was solemn．The first man giggled，the second man chuckled，and the third man chortled．The first man bowed and spoke，“We wear our masks on yesterdays and on tomorrows．”

The second said，“And since those sad days never come—”

The third man said，“We know no sorrows．”He waved his mask at Thag．“My name is Wag，and this is Gag and that is Jag．”

“My name，”said Thag，“is Thag．”

“A lovely name，”said Wag．

“A charming name，”said Gag．

“A truly gorgeous name，”said Jag．“I wish I'd thought of it myself．”

“Welcome to Euphoria，”said Wag，“the sweetest little land in all the world，a hundred million welcomes，Thag．You are the finest，greatest Prince that we have ever known．”

“You do not know me well，”said Thag．

“We know you perfectly，”said Wag．

“We know you wonderfully，”said Gag．

“We know you beautifully，”said Jag．

Thag frowned．“I seek the way to Thedon Grove in the Forest of Jeopardy，”he said．“I must ride on．My time is short．”

“Jeopardy's so far away you'll never reach it in a day，”said Wag．

“Or in a month，”said Gag．

“Or in a year，”said Jag．“We know the place，a truly gorgeous place．”

“A charming place，”said Gag．

“A lovely place，”said Wag．

Thag grew restless on his restless horse．“Tell me，are the perils worse，and have the monsters grown？”

The three men placed their arms about each other's shoulders and laughed until they cried and cried until they laughed again．

“The perils and the monsters，”giggled Wag，“are neither here nor there nor anywhere．”

“Forget the perils，”chuckled Gag．

“Dismiss the monsters，”chortled Jag．

The three men laughed and cried again and cried and laughed．

“Which way to Jeopardy？”yelled Thag in such a voice the laughter and the crying stopped．

“It's straight ahead，”said Wag．

“Ride by the Bye，”said Gag．

“And pass the Time of Day，”said Jag．

The three men began to giggle and chuckle and chortle again as Thag galloped away and straight ahead and on and on through the green Valley which was loud with the sound of gaiety and joy and jollity and frolic and frivolity．

He rode by the Bye，a merry sparkling stream，and passed the Time of Day，a great clock on whose dial was painted a laughing face．The hills fell away on either side and the grass changed from green to brown and then to gray．A jolly man at the far end of the Valley of Euphoria cried “Carpe Diem”as Thag flashed by．

The road was rough and rocky now，geese gaggled by，and thorns fell from the thorn trees and stuck point-down in the earth like daggers．As Thag drew near the edge of Jeopardy，the weather underwent a fearful change．There was a mist of moss to ride through and a storm of glass．Hurricanes and monsoons and tidal waves came in from the sea，tornadoes and cyclones tore up the crust of the earth，and mistrals descended from the mountains．

There was the musical stream to swim，whose soft waters swayed so somnolently and sang so sweetly that Thag had to struggle savagely against drowsiness and death by drowning．His black horse whinnied with fear，but the King's son urged him on and the horse galloped through the perilous woods．A great wind came up from the earth．Trees fell before the horse and rider and behind them and on both sides of them．Great holes opened and closed in the earth like giants' mouths，but Thag guided his horse around them and over them and between them．

Fire swept the forest but Thag sped through it safely．Hailstones as large as chalices fell all around but he avoided them．Lightning flashed and thunder rolled and the rain came down in torrents but Prince Thag rode on，singing．

At last the black trees of Thedon Grove loomed up，the haunt of the great Blue Boar．Thag dismounted，lance in hand，and crept forward cautiously．His ears were deafened by a terrible sound，the sound of snoring，rising and falling．Gripping his lance tightly，Thag moved toward the sound，which seemed to come from the foot of an obob tree．To Prince Thag's high astonishment，the enormous Blue Boar of Thedon Grove，which slept only thirty winks in every thirty years，was snoring under the obob tree，his great eyes closed，his huge sides heaving．

Thag stepped forward softly and swiftly，but the monster，dreaming of danger，opened one eye and struggled to its feet with a mighty “scareoooooff！”

It was too late．Thag's lance was on its sure way to the Blue Boar's heart．The Blue Boar of Thedon Grove toppled over on his side with such force that he dug his own grave．

Thag reached down and broke off the golden tusks as easily as if they had been icicles．A moment later he was riding back through the menacing woods．

Round rocks ten feet in diameter crossed and crissed and crisscrossed his path，and buzbuz birds in vast numbers flew at Thag's head，opening and closing their scissor-like beaks．The Prince and his black charger evaded the boulders and the buzbuz birds with marvelous jumps and dodgings，and broke at last into the clear，and raced for the castle of his father，the golden tusks of the great Blue Boar shining in his hand．

From a tall window in a high room of King Clode's castle，the Princess watched with wide eyes and trembling body the road her suitors had taken，to where it split into separate directions like a branching candlestick．Thag had followed the road to the right，Gallow the road to the left，and Jorn had traveled straight ahead．

As far as the mysterious maiden's eyes could see，there was no cloud of dust on any road，no sign of horse or man．She watched the middle road with hope and eagerness，the roads that branched to right and left with terror and dismay．

In his shadowy shop Tocko sat quietly，trying to think of chill and fragile rhymes for “time”and “sorrow．”

The Royal Wizard squatted on the floor of his room in a tower，trying to change a piece of common field stone into gold by wiggling his fingers at it and crying “Ixxyzo！”Nothing happened．

The Royal Physician，still lying in bed，insulting and reassuring himself，tried to stick out his tongue far enough to see whether or not it was coated．“Come，come，”he said．“We can stick our tongue out farther than that，can't we？”he asked cheerily．“No，we can't，”he replied，sullenly．

In the Royal Library the Royal Recorder sat on a tall stool at a high desk and made an entry in his private diary：“On this day it has been established，despite the fussing and fretting and bawling and moaning of You Know Who，that the so-called Princess we have been entertaining in the castle since the night before last is，in truth and fact，by birth and destiny，a common deer．The discovery of the sorrowful secret of the unhappy beast was made by me．”

King Clode sat all alone at the head of the long table in the banquet hall，cracking walnuts between his thumb and forefinger and meditating on the advisability of taking a little wine before visiting the Princess to acquaint her with her pitiful plight．He decided it would not be a good idea to call for wine，and went on cracking walnuts．

As he turned the dilemma over in his mind，his eyes brightened and darkened and brightened and darkened．He cracked his last walnut and ate it slowly，shell and all，and slapped the table with his hand and the silver bowl that had held the walnuts jumped off the table and cackled on the floor．“Steward！”bawled Clode．“Wine！”

High up in a leafy tree where he could not be seen，Quondo scanned the three roads that led to peril．By turning his head to the left and peering through the leaves，he could see the Princess standing at the tall window in the high room．

In the Royal Gamekeeper's lodge，the Royal Gamekeeper's wife rearranged crocks on a shelf，talking to the Royal Gamekeeper over her shoulder．“I don't believe a word of it，I don't care what you say．She never was a deer，if you ask me．They made the story up，to cloak their goings-on．You men are all alike．Enchanted Princess，indeed！ Enchanted hussy！ I know her kind．She loitered in the woods and waved at them！”

The Royal Gamekeeper's wife picked up a crock，rubbed it vigorously with a cloth and set it down again．“Dainty，you insist she is．I say she's dirty．And as for being twenty-one，she's nearer thirty．”The Gamekeeper's wife wiped and wiped and wiped another crock．“That castle surely needs a woman's hand．It's full of broken glass and spider webs．Too bad Her Royal Highness had to die，poor thing．I always say he struck her in his cups．”

She stepped back from the shelf and regarded her handiwork．

“If she is a princess then I have no doubt she's one of old King Puggy's daughters—eldest of the seven，I should say．She's pretty in their bold and brazen way…．Well，what's the matter？..．Has the leopard got your tongue？”

The Royal Gamekeeper did not answer．He was sitting in a chair，his hands folded on his stomach，fast asleep．





The Perilous Labor of Prince Gallow


Prince Gallow's way led to the left and then to the right and then to the left again，and he came at last to a white path through a peaceful wood．As he jingled along the path，Gallow stared in amazement at a kind of forest he had never seen before．The trees were hung with signs and legends… “Lost Babes Found．”“Giants Killed While You Wait．”“7 League Boots Now 6.98．”“Let Us Waken Your Sleeping Beauty．”“We put You on an Urn，Men Put You on a Pedestal．”“Consult Panting ＆ Young．”“Seek Grailo，Even Better Than the True Grail．”“Coach Pie，Pumpkin Wheels，Horse Traps，Mice Shoes．”

The sign that most interested the gaping Gallow read：“Visit the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore．Free，Except Moondays and Feydays．”

As Gallow gazed about in wild wonder，a man wearing a silver cap and a garment made of brass saluted him．

“Your parchments，brother，”said the man in metal．

“I am not your brother，and my name is Prince Gallow，”said the perplexed Prince．

“In the Forest of Willbe all men are brothers，”the man said．

“This sounds friendly but confusing，”said Gallow．“I have no parchments，brother．”

The man looked grave for a moment，then closed one eye and spoke in a low voice．“You have the semblance of a gentleman of intelligence and wit，”he said．“Now it just happens that I have an extra set of proper parchments that I will let you have for a song．”

“What song shall I sing？”said Gallow．

“In the Forest of Willbe a song is there large emeralds，”the man replied．“Have you three large emeralds？”

From a sack on his saddle，Gallow extracted three emeralds and gave them to the man，who thereupon handed the Prince a red parchment，a blue parchment，and a white parchment．

“Give the red parchment to the man in white，the blue parchment to the man in red，and the white parchment to the man in blue，”he said．“It's less simple that way for everybody．”The man in metal touched a finger to his cap and walked away．

Gallow rode along the edge of the woods until he came to another path and he rode down the path until he came to a man in white．

Gallow gave the man in white the red parchment．“Will you point me the way that leads to the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore？”asked the Prince．The man in white was staring at the red parchment．

“This is not a true and proper parchment，”said the man in white．“The seal is missing，the signature is doubtful，and the symbol is yesterday's．”He was grave for a moment，then he closed one eye and spoke in a low voice．“You have the semblance of a gentleman of courage and nobility，”he said．“You journey on a mission of high peril，or I am dressed in green．Now I could tear this parchment up，and let you pass，and make no cross for you there on that tree to show a knight has gone this way，but that's too safe for your discomfort and for mine．I'll change the seal and signature and symbol to make the parchment proper，and all this for a song，brother，all this for a song．It's more perilous that way for everybody．”

Prince Gallow sighed and gave the man three emeralds from his sack and rode on till he came to the man in blue．

The man in blue took the white parchment and was grave for a moment．Then he closed one eye and spoke in a low voice．

“You have the semblance of a man of learning and discernment，brother，”he said，“but I can't let you pass until you prove your power to read，and how can you or I or anyone read this？”He gave the parchment back to Gallow，who saw that the writing on it could be read only by holding it up to a mirror．

“I cannot read these words unless I have a looking-glass，”Prince Gallow cried．

The man in blue produced from his sleeve a silver and ivory mirror，and handed it to the frowning Prince．“Now read the legend in the glass，”he said．

Gallow tucked the parchment under his chin，held the mirror before him and read：“Forget the Past，Enjoy the Present，the Future Will Take Care of Itself．”

Prince Gallow let the parchment drift to the ground．“I have a strange feeling that I am neither Here nor There，”he said，“and that this is neither Now nor Then．I am caught somewhere between the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow．”

The man in blue looked grave for a moment．“That is because you have ridden out of the Past into the Future，”he said．He closed one eye．“In giving up Was for Willbe，you have lost Am．”He spoke in a low voice．“You have had the Past，you behold the Future about you，but you have no Present．Now it just happens that you hold in your hand a very fine present—a present of ivory and silver fit for a princess．Vulcan made it for Venus who left it to Cleopatra who gave it to Isolde who bequeathed it to my grandmother．I will let you have it for a song．”

Prince Gallow sighed，drew three emeralds from his sack and gave them to the man in blue．

“Which way to the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore that guards the Sacred Sword of Loralow？”he asked patiently．

“Turn right，then right，then right，then right，”said the man in blue．

“But that would take me around in a square and bring me back to where I am now，”said Gallow．

“It's much more impressive that way for everybody，”said the man in blue as he walked away，clicking his emeralds．

The second son of Clode rode around the square of paths as he had been directed，and when he came back to where he had started from，he found a man in red waiting for him．

“Your blue parchment，”said the man in red．Gallow handed him the parchment．

“Which way to the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore that guards the Sacred Sword of Loralow？”the Prince inquired．

The man in red looked grave for a moment；then he closed one eye and spoke in a low voice．

“You have the semblance of a gentleman of shrewdness and cunning，”he said．“close your eyes，brother．”Gallow closed his eyes and the man in red concealed the blue parchment under a stone．“Open your eyes，brother，”he said，and Gallow opened his eyes．“Do you see the blue parchment that I hold in my hand？”asked the man．“No，you do not，for I have made it invisible．In the same manner I can make you and your horse invisible so that you can ride up to the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore and take the Sacred Sword of Loralow without being seen．This service I will perform for three songs．”

Gallow took nine emeralds from his sack，which left him only twelve，and gave them to the man in red．

“You are invisible now and neither man nor dragon can see you，”said the other．“It is more deceptive that way for everybody．”

“Which way to the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore？”demanded Gallow．

“The Hard Way，”said the man in red．“Down and down，round and round，through the Moaning Grove of Artanis．”

“How shall I know this Grove？”asked Gallow．

“By its red roses and its million moons and its blue houses，in each of which sits a solitary maiden moaning for her lover who is far away．Fear not the roaring of the dreadful Tarcomed，nor yet the wuffing-puffing of the surly Nacilbuper，but ride straight on．”

“And when I have passed through the Grove，”asked the Prince．

“Turn to the right and follow a little white light，”said the man in red as he walked away，jiggling his emeralds．

Gallow rode and rode till he came to the Grove of Artanis．The scent of the red roses assailed his nostrils，the light of the million moons blinded his eyes，and the moaning of the lonely maidens deafened his ears so that he galloped as fast as his horse could go until he came to a winding road and turned to the right．In front of him appeared suddenly a little white light and he followed it round and round and down and down．

Presently Prince Gallow heard the sound of many people talking and laughing and shouting and singing，and he saw tables along the side of the road spread with fruits and meats，and other tables piled with baubles and gewgaws and gimcracks and kickshaws new to his sight and strange to his memory．

On the trees hung heavy musical instruments he had never dreamed of，and the people were dressed in a remarkable fashion and danced in a remarkable way，down and down and round and round．Above the sounds of the people rose a curious and alarming buzzing and whirring and ringing and thumping．

“Here you are，brother！”cried a man dressed in black and blue，and he held out seven small spheres to Gallow．“Seven balls for twelve emeralds！ Try your luck！”

“You hand me these spheres，”said Gallow in a puzzled tone，“yet you cannot see me for I have been made invisible．”

“Of course I see you，”said the man．“Plain as day，big as life，ugly as sin．Buy the balls and toss them in．”

“I do not understand what you are saying，”said the bewildered Prince．

“Look，brother，”said the man．“Twelve emeralds get you seven balls．You throw the balls at the Seven-headed Dragon of Dragore in that striped tent yonder—the greatest mechanical wonder of the age，meaningless but marvelous．The seven heads go round and round and down and down．Try your luck，try your skill！ Toss a ball into each of the seven heads and you win the genuine and only Sacred Sword of Loralow．A ball in six，two golden bricks．Five and dandy，a box of candy．Four a key and three a rose．And so it goes and so it goes．”

The man gave the seven balls to Gallow and took his sack of emeralds．“You can't win，brother，”he said，“and I can't lose．That makes it fair and square for everybody．”He looked grave for a moment，then closed one eye and spoke in a low voice．

“You have the semblance of a gentleman of honor and integrity，”he said．“Now if the great key in the side of the mechanical Dragon is not wound，the seven heads will not go round and round and down and down，and you can toss a ball into each of the seven heads and win the Sacred Sword．In return for this little service and secret，I ask only for the golden saddle I see there on your horse．”

Gallow was so confused he could not say a word．He strode silently into the striped tent and there he saw the Seven-headed Dragon，its heads now motionless，their mouths open．Between the claws of its great feet lay the glittering sword for which he had endured so much．One after another Gallow tossed the balls until each had dropped into a separate gaping mouth．Then he walked over and picked up the Sacred Sword of Loralow and left the striped tent．As he did so，a small tired man appeared，walked to an iron chest，opened it，took out one of a hundred identical swords and placed it between the paws of the mechanical Dragon．He yawned and shuffled away．

Outside the striped tent the man in black and blue waved gaily at Gallow as the Prince mounted the bare back of his black horse and rode off swiftly the way he had come，up the winding road，past the little white light，through the Grove of Artanis and along the many paths until at last he broke out of the Forest of Willbe and galloped for the castle of his father，the Sacred Sword of Loralow shining in his hand．

The Princess，standing at the tall window in the high room of King Clode's castle，strained her eyes and held her hand to her wild heart．She tried to pray，but since he had a memory of trees and fields and a memory of nothing more，she found no prayer to say．

The Princess tried again to remember her name and she could not．A black doubt crept into her mind and heart．Perhaps she was in truth a nameless waif，a woman of the fields or kitchen，changed into a deer by some woods or castle wizard whom she had unwittingly offended while milking a cow or serving broth．If so，it might have been the wicked wizard's whim to cast a spell that only a king's three sons，in hot pursuit，could break．Perhaps the sorcerer had laughed and said，“Three sons of a famous king will break your spell and break their hearts and then your own，for who would have a milkmaid for his bride？”

Perhaps the true disenchantment would come when the swiftest Prince should place his trophy at her feet and cry，“I claim your heart and hand．”

Perhaps then she herself could and would confess，“My name is Such-and-Such and I'm a peasant，”or，“My name is So-and-So and I'm a scullery maid．”She hoped，if this were to be the awful ending of her cruel enchantment，that Thag or Gallow and not Jorn would be the first to cry，“I claim your heart and hand．”

But in spite of these dark thoughts，the eyes of the nameless maiden peered down the straight road Jorn had taken．Shadows lay across the road，spreading and thickening like black blood，but there was no sign of dust，no mark of horse or man．The Princess forced herself to look to the left and then to the right．Nothing moved except the shadows of trees stirring in the wind along the road Gallow had taken，but the Princess almost cried out when she saw what she thought was a cloud of dust on the road Thag had followed．It rose slowly above the trees and she saw that it was only a swan flying．The Princess placed her hands over her eyes and shivered．





The Perilous Labor of Prince Jorn


The way to the cherry orchard lay straight and smooth as a legend for Prince Jorn，with only a small twist here and a little jog there．The sun shone warmly，the wind blew softly，a cock crowed and children called far away，and overhead the birds sang．

In one place a storm of paper cut in the fragilely beautiful designs of snowflakes blew dreamily across the road，and in another a wolf raised his head and howled，enabling Jorn to see that the creature wore a collar．

The youngest son of King Clode rode sorrowfully on his mission in spite of his love for the Princess，for he did not believe the labor set for him held perils worthy of his strength and courage．

“Any child can pluck a thousand cherries and place them in a silver chalice，”he said aloud．“Any moon-crazed idiot could overthrow the artificial Mok-Mok，made of clay and sandalwood to frighten birds away．I would meet the Blue Boar face to face or slay the dreadful dragon with the seven heads．Set me a difficult riddle，a terrible task，a valiant knight to overthrow！”

As Prince Jorn ended his plaint，he heard a voice calling high and shrill．He looked all about him but he could see no one，and still the voice kept crying，“Help me，help me，Jorn，and you shall have a difficult riddle，a terrible task，and a valiant knight to overthrow．Help me，help me，Jorn！”

The Prince looked left and right and north and south and down and up，and when he looked up，he saw her—a witch caught on the highest branch of a tree，crying piteously，a witch hung high in the air like a smoky lantern．

Prince Jorn dismounted and climbed the tree and lifted the witch from the highest branch and carried her safely to the ground．

“I was riding the whirlwind，”she said，“and got caught in the tree and lost my broom and woe was me．”

Jorn looked all around and realized at last that the witch's broom must have fallen into a clump of tall plants called witches'-broom because they look so much like a witch's broom．It took him a long time to find the witch's broom in the witches'-broom but he stumbled on it at last and returned it to its owner．

“For your kindness，Prince Jorn，”said the witch as she mounted her broom，“you shall have a difficult riddle to do，a terrible task to undergo，a valiant knight to overthrow．”She waved her long bony fingers and sailed away，her shrill laughter trailing behind her．

Jorn rode along the straight smooth way until he came to where a Sphinx crouched beside the road．

“Name me a riddle，Sphinx，”said Jorn．

The stony eyes of the Sphinx stared straight ahead and its stony jaws did not move but it spoke：

“What is whirly？

What is curly？

Tell me，what is pearly early？”

Jorn replied in a trice：

“Gigs are whirly，

Cues are curly

And the dew is pearly early．”

He rode on a little way and then rode back．

“What are difficult about that riddle？”asked the Prince．

“It was difficult to say without moving my jaws，”said the Sphinx．

Jorn shrugged his shoulders and continued on his way until he came all of a sudden upon the great cherry orchard．He dismounted，unslung the silver chalice from his saddle and strode into the orchard，the chalice in his left hand，his sword in his right．

In a clearing in the middle of the cherry orchard lay the Mok-Mok，on its left side．The winds had blown it over，the rains had crumbled its clay，and the worms had eaten its sandalwood．The head of the Mok-Mok had broken off in its fall and larks nested in the hollow eyes．An enormous roc perched drowsily on the shattered monster's flank，and Jorn drove it off with the point of his sword．Not far away in a rusting suit of armor lay the dusty bones of a knight who had died of terror in the days when the Mok-Mok had been new and awful to look upon．

Jorn saw that the branches of all the trees hung close to the ground under the weight of the bright red fruit they bore，and he wondered that cherries could be so heavy．He dropped his sword in the grass．First with one hand and then with both，he tried to pull a cherry from its stem to put it in the silver chalice，and discovered that it was not a cherry at all，but a ruby in the shape of a cherry．All the cherries on all the trees were rubies and none of them would come off the stems no matter how hard he tugged，and none of the stems would come off the branches．

“You must count a thousand thousand to pick a thousand cherries，”said a voice behind Jorn，and the Prince turned to see a small man in a peaked hat looking at him，his large eyes twinkling．

“Say one，two，three，”said the man．

“One，two，three，”said Jorn．

“Four，five，six，”said the man．

“Four，fix，six，”said Jorn，and when he had counted rapidly up to a thousand，a ruby fell into the silver chalice．

“But a thousand thousand is a million，”said Jorn，“and to count to a million is a terrible task！”

“A terrible task you wished for，a terrible task you have，”said the man．

Jorn counted to a thousand again，and again a ruby fell into the chalice．

“One，two，three，four，I came to pick cherries，five，six，seven，eight，and I find rubies，nine，ten！”cried Jorn．

“Rubies，cherries，cherries，rubies，”said the small man，“it is the same thing．”

“Eleven，twelve，how is it the same thing？”asked Jorn．“Thirteen，fourteen，fifteen，sixteen．”

The small man paced up and down and said，“What am I doing？”

“Seventeen，eighteen，nineteen，twenty，you are walking back and forth，”said Jorn．“Twenty-one—”

“But how can I walk back and forth without first walking forth and back？”

“It is the same thing，”said Jorn．“A man who walks，twenty-two，forth and back，twenty-three，is walking back and forth，twenty-four，twenty-five，twenty-six，twenty-seven，twenty-eight，twenty-nine，thirty．”

“If forth and back are back and forth，then back is forth and forth is back，”said the small one．

“I do not see how that helps me in this terrible task，”said Jorn．He finished counting his third thousand and a third cherry dropped into the silver chalice．“At this slow pace Thag will ride home ahead of me with the golden tusks of the great Blue Boat，and Gallow will ride home ahead of me with the Sacred Sword of Loralow，and one of them will marry the Princess while I still count cherries into my chalice．One，two，three，four，five．”

The small man sat on the ground and looked at the Prince and listened as he counted to his fourth thousand and the fourth cherry fell into the silver chalice．Jorn began to count again．

“Fifty princes in fifty years have come to this orchard to gather cherries or rubies for this princess or that，”said the small man，“and not one of them has used logic in his labor．I am not a prince and I cannot make the cherries fall—or the rubies，if you will，I have let the other fifty princes pluck the fruit or the jewels their own way because it is worth counting to a million for the heart and hand of a lovely lady．With you，my friend，we have this Thag to think of and this Gallow．There is a logical secret to the falling of the cherries．I cannot tell it outright but I can ask you questions．”

“Three hundred and forty-eight，three hundred and forty-nine，three hundred and fifty，”said Jorn．“What questions would you ask？”

“Does a cherry drop when you say ninety-nine？”

“No．”

“Does a ruby fall when you say nine hundred and ninety-nine？”

“No．”

“When does a cherry or a ruby fall？”

“Three hundred and fifty-one．When I say one thousand，”said Jorn．

A ruby dropped into his silver chalice．

“One thousand！”cried Jorn again and another ruby fell．

“One thousand，one thousand，one thousand，one thousand！”cried Jorn and four more rubies fell into the chalice．

In no time at all or，to be exact，in one-thousandth the time it would have taken him to count to a million by ones，Jorn had filled the chalice with a thousand rubies．He looked around to thank the small man in the peaked cap，but he was nowhere to be seen．Instead there stood before Jorn a knight in black armor，the tallest and strongest Black Knight that the young Prince had ever seen．

“Name me your name，Black Knight！”cried Jorn．

“I am Duff of the Dolorous Doom！”thundered a great voice under the gleaming casque which covered all save the dark eyes of the Black Knight．“Fifty princes have I fought beneath these trees，and live to tell the tale！”

Jorn put down the silver chalice and picked up his sword．

“I am armored all in steel．Sets not the balance in my favor？”rumbled the Black Knight．

Jorn raised his sword．

The Black Knight kept his own sword at his side．“There's magic here，I warn you，Prince．What's mightier than magic？”

“Miracle．”

“What's miracle？”asked the Black Knight．

“Love's miracle enough．”

“Armor，Prince，is stronger stuff．”The Black Knight raised his sword swiftly and steel rang against steel．Duff swung his sword above his head with both hands as a man swings an ax，and brought it down so savagely that it whined in the air，but Jorn stepped quickly to one side and thrust at a chink he detected in the Black Knight's armor，just under the right shoulder．

Duff brought up his sword barely in time to strike Jorn's sword away．Time and again he lunged and swung and thrust，and time and again Jorn parried the lunges and sidestepped the swinging steel，stabbing at the chink in Duff's armor whenever it gaped open．Once when a lightning-thrust threw Jorn off balance，the Black Knight would have cleft his head to his chin had he not in turn been thrown off balance by stumbling against the chalice of rubies，scattering them in the green grass．The battle surged and circled in and out among the trees with a great ringing and flashing of steel．The point of Jorn's sword struck like a bright snake at the chink in the Black Knight's armor which opened and closed like a small mouth as he lunged and drew back and lunged again．The Black Knight began to breathe harder and harder，his thrusts were slower and slower and he no longer lifted the sword high over his head for the cruel slashing strokes which in the first hour of the battle had fallen close to Jorn's body．

At last the Black Knight raised his sword above his head with both hands for a stroke that would cut the young Prince in two like an apple，and swift as light，Jorn's sword darted for the chink under the right shoulder．His sword point cut deep and the Black Knight's weapon fell to the ground．His right arm swung uselessly by his side like a pendulum．

The massive figure in black steel staggered and fell to the grass with a great clangor．The casque that had hidden all save the dark eyes of the Black Knight was wrenched loose and rolled over and over，stopping with a clank against the silver chalice，Prince Jorn saw to his amazement and horror that the head and face revealed to him were the head and face of a man of seventy years．Jorn knelt beside his fallen foe in sorrow and regret and held the knight's head in his arms．

“I would not have fought so venerable a knight had I known，”said Jorn．

“You fought the fearful thing I seemed to be，and that's the test and proof of valor，that's the proof and test．When all is dark within the house，who knows the monster from the mouse？”The Black Knight's voice no longer thundered but was small and thin．

Jorn helped the old man to his feet and staunched the blood and bound his wound．“What may I trust？”cried Jorn．“What's there to trust？”

“Ah，trust your heart，”the old man said．“Trust love．Fifty years ago I undertook a fearful labor for a lady's love．Armored all in pride and arrogance，I sought to meet the dreadful Mok-Mok face to face and came upon this harmless thing of wood and clay．‘Then love's whim！’ I cried，‘and man's fool！’ … The peril and the labor，Price，lie not in dreadful monsters or in mighty deeds，but in the keeping of the heart a man has won．This is the Dolorous Doom of one who rode not home to claim his lady's hand—that each and every Maytime till I die，I must be overthrown by love which once I overthrew．”

Jorn was silent for a little space and then he said，“One of your brothers，then，came back with golden tusks or a silver sword and won the lady's hand？”

The old man shivered inside his armor．

“She never wed，but sat with owls by day and cats by night，peering far and near and crying，‘Hark！’ Her true love came in every form，in dust and wind and roses．Her voice grew high and shrill and wild and wilder．And in the end she brewed an evil brew of mice and woad and cockatrice and rue，and over this she cast a spell in metaphor．The steel I wear is Strength，the flaw therein is Pride．Thunder how I will，I'm never safe inside．”The old Knight blinked away a tear．“Men see her once in every Maytime，swinging like a smoky lantern in a tree… Ride swiftly，Prince，and love ride with you．”

The young Prince watched the aged Knight in silence and heard him out．“She named you Valiant，”was all that Jorn could say，“and placed the crevice in your armor not too near the heart．”

There was a deep moaning from the armor as the figure of Duff of the Dolorous Doom clanked slowly away and was lost among the trees．

Prince Jorn hurriedly refilled the chalice with the scattered rubies and a moment later he was riding swiftly for the castle of his father，the silver chalice shining in his hand．





The Dark Enchantment


Four knuckles rapped seven times on the door of the high room in the castle，and when the Princess bade her visitor to enter，King Clode strode in，and after him came Tocko and the Royal Recorder and the Royal Physician．

“We have three bitter things to say—a fact，a tale，and a conclusion，”began Clode，and his heavy face turned red．

“If I may speak first，Sire，”said the Princess，“I have a bitter doubt to say．”

“Then speak your doubt，”said Clode，“unless it touch the honor of my sons or me．”

“Tut，tut，tut，tut，”said Tocko，who was peering closely at the Princess．

“Tut me no tuts，”said Clode，“I am in no mood this day for tutting．”

He waved his hand and the Princess went on．“The doubt has come to me that since I cannot remember my name，perhaps I have no name to speak of．Perhaps I am a milkmaid or a kitchen wench．”

“Tut，tut，”said Tocko．“My mother was a country maid and often used to sing：

‘When all the Princesses are gone，

The country maids will still go on.’”

“I have no contempt for any woman，”said the Princess，“as long as she confesses who and what she is．And there are rules，decrees，and orders by which no maid of low estate or common blood may marry Jorn．”

“Or Thag，”said Clode．

“Or Gallow，”said the Royal Recorder．

“My father used to sing a rhyme that went，in part，”said Tocko：

“‘Kings and Princes，

Dolts and dunces—’”

“You'll end your rhyme in the dungeon if you do not hold your peace！”cried King Clode．He walked over to the Princess，who was once more scanning the three roads with anxious eyes．

“I could swear，and almost do，in spite of facts I'm privy to，that you're a princess of the blood．”He turned and addressed the others．“Mark the manner of her speech and the carriage of her head．”

“And the slimness of her ankle and the smallness of her foot，”said the Royal Recorder．

“And the highness of her forehead and the brightness of her eye，”said Tocko．

“You are deceived by illusion，”cried the Royal Physician，who had been quietly taking his own pulse but not counting it，for as a patient，he still considered himself sick，while as a physician he contended that he was well．“It's this confounded sorcery．I tell you nothing confuses the practice of medicine one half as much as sorcery．I recall a patient I had，a wizard，who could cause a tumor to dance all over his body and assume even the appearance of a flower or a jewel．Let us not be taken in by false shapes and semblances．What is，was—and what was，will be．I'll test the creature's heart．”

“The lady's heart，”said Clode．

“We'll go by seeming till we have the proof．”

“I promised her a fact，a tale，and a conclusion，”said Clode．

“I'll tell the tale，”said Tocko．

“I'll draw the conclusion，”said the Royal Physician．

“I'll state the fact，”said the Royal Recorder．“It is a fact，then，”he said to the Princess，“that you cannot remember your name．”

“Tocko will tell the tale，”said Clode．

“In point of fact，”said the Royal Recorder，“and truth and count and number，there are more tales than one to tell．There's Tocko's tale，and nine besides，all identical，exact，and parallel．”

“We'll stick to one，”said Clode，“since they are all the same．”

“I merely wish to state，avow，affirm，asseverate，maintain，confess，proclaim，protest，announce，vouchsafe，and say that there are precisely ten such tales in all，and each and every one duplicates，substantiates，corroborates，and proves each and every other．”

“Don't wrap me up in words！”cried Clode．“Tocko，tell the tale！”

And Tocko told the tale of the white deer of a hundred years ago，and how it was in truth a deer and not a princess of the blood．

The Princess listened in silence，standing very still．

“The Royal Physician will draw the conclusion，”ordered King Clode．

The Royal Physician，who had been saying “ah”to himself in a corner and tapping his chest and counting to nine，stepped forward．

“The conclusion to be drawn，”he said，touching the tips of his fingers together，“the conclusion to be drawn is that you are in fact and in truth，beyond the shadow，question，or peradventure of a doubt—but stay，I did not test your heart．”He placed his right ear against the breast of the Princess and listened，muttering “hm”and “ho”and “hm”again．

“The heart is much too high，much too high，”he announced at last，“both as to location and rapidity of beat．There is a skip，a definite skip，such as might be brought on by too much leaping over brooks，much too much leaping over brooks，but I could not give a final opinion，of course，until I had examined the brooks．”

The King scowled and looked away．“Draw the conclusion，”he ordered．

“Ah，yes，the conclusion，”said the Royal Physician．“The conclusion is that in all human probability—or should I say all animal probability？ —but certainly not to all intents and purposes，you are，dear lady—dear creature，I should say—a deer…．Say ‘ah，’”the Royal Physician added to himself，and he retired to a corner，saying “ah．”

King Clode stared at the cold stone floor，his face still flushed；the Royal Recorder fumbled foolishly with a pocketful of seals and ribbons；Tocko's dim old eyes，no longer strong enough to see the moon or the stars，were soft with pity．

The Princess did not move except to lift her head a little higher．

“If you still cannot remember your name，then you must be a deer，”said the King．

“A princess would remember her name，”said the Royal Recorder．

“Particularly in view of the fact that there is no evidence of a concussion severe enough to eradicate memory，and no marked dilation or contraction of the pupils of the eye to indicate the presence of a potion，philter，or other obliterant，”said the Royal Physician．“Obliterant，”he repeated，frowning．“Is there such a word？”

“You are perhaps thinking of ‘eradicant，’”said the Royal Recorder．“Eradicant is a word，I believe，although when you repeat it，it does sound meaningless．”

“Be done with this weighing of words，this measuring of meaning！”cried Clode．“Explain the nature of the spell，the rule of her enchantment．”

The Royal Recorder cleared his throat and spoke．

“In enchantment of this kind—which I hold to be in extremely bad taste—the true deer，having assumed the face and form of a princess，finds it impossible，for obvious reasons，to retain the love of knight or prince or peasant，once her unhappy secret is revealed．”

“Get on with it，get on with it，”ordered the King．

“‘Love most certainly shall fail you thrice，thus runs the line and measure of your spell，’”intoned the Recorder solemnly．“‘When love has failed you thrice，you will resume the shape and semblance of a deer.’”

“And mind you，no more leaping over brooks．Bad for the heart，”the Royal Physician said．“Mee，mee，mee，mee，”he added，testing his throat for soreness．

“Alas and woe，unhappy doe！”the Royal Recorder cried．

“Hold your tongue，you saucy clerk！”said Clode．“This lady is a princess to the present sight，and shall be so addressed while still she stands on two legs，not on four．”

The Princess spoke at last，her dark eyes clear and fearless．“I ask the right to tell my Prince，before he claims my heart and hand，this sorry tale，”she said．

“Asked and granted，done and done！”Clode bowed．“And spoken like a princess．”

The Royal Recorder cleared his throat again．“If it should chance，happen，occur，take place，or come to pass that this Prince or that or the other should still maintain his love for you，in spite of what has been，and truly is，and should be，why，then you will forever keep the shape and semblance of a princess．So reads the ancient spell，so runs the old enchantment．”

Tocko stepped forward and raised his hand．“I beg you to remember，Clode，the mother of your sons once bore the shape and semblance of a deer，and yet she was in truth a princess of the royal blood．”

“But damn it all，she knew her name！”cried Clode．“This pretty deer—”

“This princess，by your own decree，”the Royal Recorder said．

“This Princess，then—”Clode began again and flushed and turned away．

“I am what I will be，”said the Princess．“I will be what I am．”

“There's this to lift your heart，”said Clode．“You were the swiftest deer that ever tried the strength and skill of men．No common oaf shall give you chase，as in the case of Tocko's father's deer．You're fit for kings and princes as you stand or as you run．”

The room had clouded with darkness，and in the moment of silence that followed the King's high praise，there was a distant sound of many hoof beats．The King strode to the window and looked out．

“What magic's this？”he shouted．“Behold！ Three trophies shine together！ Three Princes ride as one！ Their paths have crossed and joined where inch and second meet．There's miracle in this，and sorcery．”

Tocko，the Royal Recorder，and the Royal Physician peered over King Clode's enormous shoulders and beheld Thag and Gallow and Jorn galloping for the castle gates，their trophies shining in their hands，there horses racing nose to nose as if in single harness．

The Princess，who stood with her back to the fading light of the window，her eyes closed，felt a hand take hers and heard the deep voice of Quondo the dwarf say，“Come．”He led her from the room down the winding stone stair and into the great circular chamber．He handed her into the high carved golden chair and squatted on the floor beside it at her right．

The circular room rang with the sound of running feet as the breathless King and his breathless retainers rushed in through one door，and the panting Princes rushed in through another．

Before the Princess in the golden chair could make the sorry tale of her enchantment heard above the stamping and the shouts，the Princes placed，all at the same moment，their trophies at her feet—Thag，the golden tusks of the great Blue Boar；Gallow，the Sacred Sword of Loralow，and Jorn，the silver chalice filled with rubies—the while they cried in perfect unison，“I claim your heart and hand！”

A heavy breathing silence fell at last and no man moved．The Princes knelt，each on one knee，their eyes upon the Princess．The King and his retainers stood like frozen men．Quondo squatted，motionless．

The Princess rose，straight and fine and fearless，and spoke in her low and lovely voice，addressing the King：“I know not in what order to proceed．Three Princes kneel as one．Three trophies shine together．”

The King scowled and turned to the Royal Recorder．“Announce the order，”he commanded．

“This wonder is unknown，at least in my time，”said the Royal Recorder．

“And in my time and in my father's，”said old Tocko．

“But I should say，if you will so decree it—”said the Royal Recorder to the King．

“Decreed！”cried Clode．“Decreed，and done and done．”

“Then let the eldest son speak first and so on，in that order．”

“I cannot see a thing，”said Tocko．

“Light the torches！”cried the King，and through the castle halls the order echoed：“LIGHT THE TORCHES！ Light the torches！ Light the torches！”

Twelve small men in yellow flashed about the chamber and in a moment flames flared from the circular wall．The Princess spoke，her sorrowful eyes on Thag．

“You claim the heart and hand of one who is in truth a deer changed by whim of witch or wizard to the shape and semblance of a woman．”

While the torches flared and flickered between the shields and lances on the wall，the Princess spoke again：

“By old remembered spells and ancient tales，by every mark and sign，three Princes claim the heart and hand of one who is in truth a deer．I know the perils you have known，the leagues forlorn，the weather borne，to lay your trophies at my nameless feet．Love me truly，fail me never—woman will I be forever；but if love shall fail me thrice，I shall vanish in a trice．So tells the tale，so runs the spells．Prince Thag，do you love me well？”

The eldest son of Clode rose to his feet．Without a word，he broke the golden tusks of the great Blue Boar in his hands and turned his back．

“Love has failed her once，”moaned Tocko．

“Love me truly，fail me never，woman will I be forever；but if love shall fail me thrice，I shall vanish in a trice．So tells the tale，so runs the spell．Prince Gallow，do you love me well？”

Prince Gallow rose to his feet．Without a word he broke the Sacred Sword of Loralow across his knee，and walked away and turned his back．

“Love has failed her twice，”whispered the Royal Recorder．

“Love me truly，fail me never，woman will I be forever；but if love shall fail me thrice，I shall vanish in a trice．So tells the tale，so runs the spell．Prince Jorn，do you love me well？”

“Love will fail her thrice，”croaked the Royal Physician．

Prince Jorn rose to his feet and lifted the silver chalice filled with rubies．

“Throw wide the portals！”roared King Clode．“Let the white deer pass！ Who reaches for his lance dies like a hog！ Throw wide the portals，let the white deer pass！”And through the castle halls the order echoed：“THROW WIDE THE PORTALS！..．Throw wide the portals！ … Throw wide the portals！..．”

The white figure that stood before the golden chair was still．All eyes were strained，all necks were craned as Prince Jorn raised the chalice．

“One could hear a petal fall，”whispered the Royal Recorder．

“I cannot hear a thing，”said Tocko．

“Silence！”roared the King．“And give her room！ Denial's in Jorn's heart，all hear her doom！”

Prince Jorn spoke：“What you have been，you are not；and what you are，you will forever be．I place this trophy in the hands of love．”

The Princess took the chalice in her hands．

“You hold my heart，”said Jorn．

As the young Prince spoke，the torches died to the tranquility of candlelight，and April fragrance filled the room，and Jorn beheld a new and lovelier Princess than he had ever seen in life or dreams．

“The fragrance，if my memory serves，”old Tocko said，“of lilacs．”

“Sh-h，”said the Royal Physician．

“Who is this Prince，this tall strange Prince who takes the chalice from the lady's hand？”whispered the Royal Recorder．

For out of nowhere in a tick of time a stranger had indeed appeared，a stranger tall and dark and young，who stood beside the lovely maid and held her chalice in his hands that she might descend the few steps from the golden chair and place her hand in Jorn's．

King Clode，who had seen the strange Prince at the same moment as the others，closed his eyes and rubbed them with his knuckles and opened them again．He took a step forward．

“Your name，your kingdom，and your cause！”bellowed Clode．

The tall Prince bowed to the King and spoke：“Before I name my name，my kingdom，and my cause，I seek a royal favor．”

“Name its nature，”said the King．

“A deed undone that long has wanted doing．”The Prince set down the silver chalice on the golden chair．

The Royal Recorder cleared his throat．“The favor should be named，described，and specified，”the Royal Recorder said．“It should be duly entered on a scroll and signed and sealed．”

“Nonsense！”said the King．“I like the young man's eye．The favor's granted．”

At this，the unknown Prince strode to where Thag and Gallow stood．He caught them up，one in each arm，and knocked their heads together seven times and set them down．

The King's loud laughter shook the iron shields on the wall．“What god is this who plays with men like puppets？”bellowed Clode．

The young Prince bowed．

“My name is Tel，your Majesty，and I'm the youngest son of Thorg，the mighty king of Northland．”

“A rich and mighty monarch and，by all report，a good man in the saddle，”said the King．He waved the young man on．

“You have my kingdom and my name，and now my cause．Your Majesty，may I present，to you，your sons，and your retainers，my youngest sister，noble daughter of a noble King，affianced bride of brave Prince Jorn？”Prince Tel bowed deeply to the dark and lovely lady whose hand still clung to Jorn's．“Her Royal Highness，the Princess Rosanore of Northland．”

Clode and his men were held as by a new enchantment，and for a long astonished moment，no one stirred and no one spoke．The face of Clode went all the colors of a flag before it found at last its normal flush of wine and weather．

“Lyres and fiddles！”bellowed Clode．“Meats and wines！ What wine，on second thought，is fit for this occasion？ Melt down a million rubies！ But stay！ On third thought，wine in bottles！ The magic's turned my heart but not my stomach．Prince Tel and Princess Rosanore，I bid you warmth and welcome，health and joy．”

“The case lacks precedent，”the Royal Recorder wailed，“and，lacking precedent，is difficult，if not，indeed，impossible，to classify，co-ordinate，and catalogue．We have here terms of two distinct and unrelated sets of spells which overlap．Overlapping，in the legal sense，I heartily deplore．”He babbled on，but no one listened．

There was a great running and scurrying and laughter and movement and a fine exchange of courtesy and compliment while lyres and fiddles played．The Royal Wizard produced a shower of silver stars，and a great table in the banquet hall was filled with meats and flowers and wine．Prince Tel sat at the head of the table beside the King，and on their right sat Rosanore and their left sat Jorn．The King smote the table a heavy blow which set the crystal dancing．

“I knew her，”said the King，“by the manner of her speech and the carriage of her head．”

“I knew her，”said the Royal Recorder，“by the smallness of her foot and the slimness of her ankle．”

“I knew her，”said Tocko，“by the highness of her forehead and the brightness of her eye．”

“I knew her by singing in my heart，”said Jorn．

Thag and Gallow glowered at their plates．

“You are a dolt，”said Thag．

“You are a dunce，”said Gallow．

Clode stared about him into the dark places under the shields．“There is a stupid dwarf，”he said to Tel，“who creeps about the night like cats．”

“Like cats，or like a cat？”

“Like cats，”said Clode．“He seems to sit in six or seven corners all at once．”

“You've had him long？”asked Tel．

“Three months or so，”said Clode．He drank off a tankard of wine．“Popped up one day，and I let him stay．A good hand with the horses and the hounds．And what is more，a better judge of men than I，in proof of which I owe the misbegotten clown a cask of gems．Never lost a wager with a lighter heart．I have a silly fondness for the dwarf．Can't say I ever showed it，though．I hope no harm's befallen him．”Clode raised another tankard to his lips and drank and closed his eyes．

“Quondo's gone forever，Sire，”said Tel in an old familiar rumble that the King remembered well．

The tankard clattered to the floor and Clode leaped to his feet and closed both eyes and opened one and stared at Tel．

“You're Quondo！”cried the King．

“I was，”said Tel．

The King drank off another bowl of wine before he spoke again．“I like the taste of wine，”he said，“the feel of leather．I'll ride or drink your father down in any weather．I am a hunter，sir，a fair man in the saddle．Ah，yes，”his eyes shone，“in any weather，I have no mind for miracle，my friend，and were I king of all the kings，I'd make an end of magic．I have few graces，Tel，no doubt for lack of daughter，and if I have offended you，I humbly beg your pardon．Wizardry's a woefuler thing than wine，and it's befuddled stronger heads than mine．”He drank deep from the bowl once more．“A deer's now Rosanore，a dwarf is Tel，what rhyme or signal broke the spell？ Who could this dark enchantment bring upon the children of a king？”

He smote the table a great blow and called for silence．

“Magic bitter，magic sweet，”Clode began．He groped for a rhyme and could not find it．“Has united the great house of Clode with the great house of Thorg．”He drank from the huge bowl of wine．“A man I can outride and outdrink the best day he ever saw，though that's beside the present point．We have beheld a miracle this day which wants explaining．I give you young Prince Fel．”He sat down and rose again with some effort．“Tel，”he said，with great dignity，and resumed his chair．

All eyes were on the tall young Prince except the eyes of Thag and Gallow，who were muttering to each other．

“The wine had mulled your wits，”said Thag．

“I tell you the Dragon has to be wound up，”said Gallow，“with a great big key．”

“Silence！”roared the King，and young Prince Tel rose to his feet and began the tale of his sister's enchantment and his own．

“My father，Sire，the great King Thorg of Northland，was loved by many damsels in his youth，”the Prince began．“His feats in battle and the chase broke open the tender locks of half a hundred hearts．”

“Powf！”said Clode．“Get on with it．”

“One damsel was a dark and jealous wench named Nagrom Yaf，who，on the day my father wed the Princess of his choice，swore a frightful vengeance on his house．

“One year and twenty days ago the Princess Rosanore and I were riding in the Wilderness of Gwain．The sun went down，the wind rose，and we were lost．A crooked moon came up and by its light we saw a creature lying in the grass，a creature like a vulture dead or dreaming．Before I could dismount，it seemed to rise and float before our eyes，making horrid signs and symbols in the air．A witch，in the unspeakable employ of Nagrom Yaf，she cast her awful spells，the while we sat like stone on stony horses．

“Rosanore was changed into a deer which could be disenchanted only if and when a king and his three sons should bring the deer to bay，but even then she would not know and could not speak her name．But on such day and in such hour as she should hear a prince declare his love for her，in spite of doubt and dread and tattle-tale，the spell would break like crystal struck on stone，and she'd be Princess Rosanore again．”

King Clode was chewing his mustaches．“And what if young Prince Jorn here had not declared his love？”he asked．

“If love had failed my sister thrice，”said Tel，“she would have wandered nameless all her life．”

“These spells，”the Royal Recorder said，“are shockingly untidy．These spells should all be written down and witnessed and attested．Of all assumption in our law，the strongest one is this：Scribendum est，which is to say that if the scroll does not exist，the scroll does not exist．And if the scroll does not exist，the spell is null and void，violable，unviable，and fallible，and tolerable only to the gullible．These present spells，i.e.，—spells A and B，involving Rosanore and Tel，hereinafter to be referred to as One and Two，should either be recast or just ignored，as never having been in legal fact，which holds that if a thing that should not be，has been，it never was．It's vastly more elastic and rewarding than the mundane or ordinary fact，which holds that just because a thing has been，it was．”

“Scribble，scrabble，scrubble！”said Clode．

“My own enchantment，”Tel resumed，“was something else and other．I was changed into a dwarf possessed of all remembrance．I knew my name and Rosanore's，but lacked the power to name our names or tell our tale in language plain or roundabout to her or any other．But on such day and in such hour as I should hear a prince declare his love for Rosanore，in spite of doubt and dread and tattle-tale，then I would be Prince Tel again．If love had failed the Princess thrice，I would have been the squat dwarf Quondo all my life．”

“How came you here，”demanded Clode．“How came your sister to our woeful woods？”

“She fled through twenty kingdoms in the year of our despair，”said Tel，“and always Quondo followed her a hundred leagues behind．Minstrels，knights，and travelers would point the way the swiftest deer in all the world had gone，and I would wander on．I lost her in the snowy months and wandered here，for men had told me tales of your enchanted woods．Enchanted woods attract enchanted things．My heart was high with hope．You were a king，Sire，and your sons were three，as stipulated in the sorcery．I fed your hounds and horses for my keep and visited the magic woods each night，dropping softly from my chamber window to the ground．At last she came．I saw her flash like moonlight through the fireflies and the snow．I'd met a wizard in the woods，the mighty wizard Ro．I could not name my name to him，or Rosanore's，or tell our tale，but wizards have a way of knowing things．In guise of minstrel here one night，he sang you songs about a deer，a deer as swift as light—”

“I thought I knew the saucy varlet's face，”roared Clode，“and said so at the time！”

The tall Prince smiled and went on with the tale．

“By this device and that device，the wizard played with time．I fancy Thag and Gallow were delayed，I fancy Jorn was speeded on his way．The wizard's magic brought the Princes riding home，not singly，but together．”

“He must have been the round man in the tree，”said Thag．

“He must have been the man in blue，”said Gallow．

“He must have been the little man who told me why cherries fall，”said Jorn．

“I knew they rode by sorcery，and said so at the time！”cried Clode．

“I don't remember that you did，”the Royal Recorder said．

“Nor I，”said Tocko．

“Nor，I，”said the Royal Physician，who was striking his knee sharply under the table to test his reflexes．

“I do，”said Rosanore．“‘There's magic here and sorcery！’ he cried．I heard it clearly．”

“As wise as she is lovely！”shouted Clode．“Surrounded by these dodderers and dolts，I blow my horn in waste land，so to speak．”He picked up a fresh bowl of wine that had been set before him．

“So ends the tale of Rosanore's enchantment and my own，”said Tel．“The rest you know．”He bowed to the King and sat down．

“I blow my horn in waste land，”repeated Clode，and since he seemed about to weep，the lyres and fiddles struck up a lively tune．

King Clode got to his feet and raised a tankard of wine，“Here's joy and jollity，”he said to Rosanore and Tel and to Rosanore and Jorn．“And here's to Thorg，a mighty King，the second huntsman of his time．All drink！”

The lyres and fiddles played brightly and the Royal Wizard produced a flight of white doves and a shower of red roses．

The Royal Physician，who always sneezed when there were doves and roses，got up and backed out of the room，bowing and sneezing．In the darkness of the corridor outside the banquet hall he stumbled over a large and dreamy flop-eared dog and fell flat on his back．He limped up to his chamber，sneezing and protesting．

The Wizard produced a silver fountain and a golden rain above the lyres and fiddles．

Old Tocko rose to his feet and recited a legend for a sundial which had come to him as he watched Jorn dance with Rosanore，and Rosanore dance with Tel：

“As slow as time，as long as love：

The rose，the fountain，and the dove．”

The Royal Recorder，who had drunk more wine than was his custom，recited laws of mortmain and chancery to himself．

King Clode rambled on above the music and the laughter．“Sing heigh and ho，and drink and dance，but not too long or late．Tomorrow when the sun is high we ride to Northland．”He winced as he pronounced the name，and closed both eyes and opened one．“I still maintain I'd rather die than drink that northern wine．It's bleak as turtle tears and harsh as witches' spells．I swear the stuff is only good for rubbing rust from buckles and from bells．”He raised a bowl of white Clodenium high above his head．“God bless us all！”he cried，and drank it off，and went to bed through the laughter and the music，the silver fountain and the golden rain，the roses and the doves．

The next day，when the sun would have marked the hour of noon on Tocko's sundials，if it could have got at them，the King and his sons and Rosanore and Tel started off for Northland in full panoply and jingling trappings．A hundred mules brought up the rear，carrying two hundred casks of red and white and yellow wines．





Epilogue


There is a dusty yellow scroll written in the olden time，which tells that on the day and in the hour when Prince Jorn said to Rosanore，“You hold my heart，”the dark and jealous Nagrom Yaf and the wicked witch in her employ were riven and shriveled by a bolt of lightning from the blue and removed completely from the world as by a strong and strange obliterant．

I find no cause to doubt the scroll，for it is signed and sealed，witnessed，and attested．





The Thirteen Clocks


Ⅰ


Once upon a time，in a gloomy castle on a lonely hill，where there were thirteen clocks that wouldn't go，there lived a cold，aggressive Duke，and his niece，the Princess Saralinda．She was warm in every wind and weather，but he was always cold．His hands were as cold as his smile and almost as cold as his heart．He wore gloves when he was asleep，and he wore gloves when he was awake，which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or the kernels of nuts，or to tear the wings from nightingales．He was six feet four，and forty-six，and even colder than he thought he was．One eye wore a velvet patch；the other glittered through a monocle，which made half his body seem closer to you than the other half．He had lost one eye when he was twelve，for he was fond of peering into nests and lairs in search of birds and animals to maul．One afternoon，a mother shrike had mauled him first．His nights were spent in evil dreams，and his days were given to wicked schemes．

Wickedly scheming，he would limp and cackle through the cold corridors of the castle，planning new impossible feats for the suitors of Saralinda to perform．He did not wish to give her hand in marriage，since her hand was the only warm hand in the castle．Even the hands of his watch and the hands of all the thirteen clocks were frozen．They had all frozen at the same time，on a snowy night，seven years before，and after that it was always ten minutes to five in the castle．Travelers and mariners would look up at the gloomy castle on the lonely hill and say，“Time lies frozen there．It's always Then．It's never Now．”

The cold Duke was afraid of Now，for Now has warmth and urgency，and Then is dead and buried．Now might bring a certain knight of gay and shining courage - “But，no！”the cold Duke muttered．“The Prince will break himself against a new and awful labor：a place too high to reach，a thing too far to find，a burden too heavy to lift．”The Duke was afraid of Now，but he tampered with the clocks to see if they would go，out of a strange perversity，praying that they wouldn't．Tinkers and tinkerers and a few wizards who happened by tried to start the clocks with tools or magic words，or by shaking them and cursing，but nothing whirred or ticked．The clocks were dead，and in the end，brooding on it，the Duke decided he had murdered time，slain it with his sword，and wiped his bloody blade upon its beard and left it lying there，bleeding hours and minutes，its springs uncoiled and sprawling，its pendulum disintegrating．

The Duke limped because his legs were of different lengths．The right one had outgrown the left because，when he was young，he had spent his morning place-kicking pups and punting kittens．He would say to a suitor，“What is the difference in the length of my legs？”and if the youth replied “Why，one is shorter than the other，”the Duke would run him through with the sword he carried in his swordcane and feed him to the geese．The suitor was supposed to say，“Why，one is longer than the other．”Many a prince had been run through for naming the wrong difference．Others had been slain for offenses equally trivial：trampling the Duke's camellias，failing to praise his wines，staring too long at his gloves，gazing too long at his niece．Those who survived his scorn and sword were given incredible labors to perform in order to win his niece's hand，the only warm hand in the castle，where time had frozen to death at ten minutes to five one snowy night．They were told to cut a slice of moon，or change the ocean into wine．They were set to finding things that never were，and building things that could not be．They came and tried and failed and disappeared and never came again．And some，as I have said，were slain，for using names that start with X，or dropping spoons，or wearing rings，or speaking disrespectfully of sin．

The castle and the Duke grew colder，and Saralinda，as a princess will，even in a place where time lies frozen，became a little older，but only a little older．She was nearly twenty-one the day a prince，disguised as a minstrel，came singing to the town that lay below the castle．He called himself Xingu，which was not his name，and dangerous，since the name began with X—and still does．He was，quite properly，a thing of shreds and patches，a ragged minstrel，singing for pennies and the love of singing．Xingu，as he so rashly called himself，was the youngest son of a powerful king，but he had grown weary of rich attire and banquets and tournaments and the available princesses of his own realm，and yearned to find in a far land the maiden of his dreams，singing as he went，learning the life of the lowly，and possibly slaying a dragon here and there．

At the sign of the Silver Swan，in the town below the castle，where taverners，travelers，tale-tellers，tosspots，troublemakers，and other townspeople were gathered，he heard of Saralinda，loveliest princess on all the thousand island of the ocean seas．“If you can turn the rain to silver，she is yours，”a taverner leered．

“If you can slay the thorny Boar of Borythorn，she is yours，”grinned a traveler．“But there is no thorny Boar of Borythorn，which makes it hard．”

“What makes it even harder is her uncle's scorn and sword，”sneered a tale-teller．“He will slit you from your guggle to your zatch．”

“The Duke is seven feet，nine inches tall，and only twenty-eight years old，or in his prime，”a tosspot gurgled．“His hand is cold enough to stop a clock，and strong enough to choke a bull，and swift enough to catch the wind．He breaks up minstrels in his soup，like crackers．”

“Our minstrel here will warm the old man's heart with song，dazzle him with jewels and gold，”a troublemaker simpered．“He'll trample on the Duke's camellias，spill his wine，and blunt his sword，and say his name begins with X，and in the end the Duke will say，‘Take Saralinda，with my blessing，O lordly Prince of Rags and Tags，O rider of the sun！’”

The troublemaker weighed eighteen stone，but the minstrel picked him up and tossed him in the air and caught him and set him down again．Then he paid his due and left the Swan．

“I've seen that youth before，”the traveler mused，staring after Xingu，“but he was neither ragamuffin then，nor minstrel．Now let me see，where was it？”

“In his soup，”the tosspot said，“like crackers．”





Ⅱ


Outside the tavern the night was lighted by a rocking yellow moon that held a white star in its horn．In the gloomy castle on the hill a lantern gleamed and darkened，came and went，as if the gaunt Duke stalked from room to room，stabbing bats and spiders，killing mice．“Dazzle the Duke with jewels，”the minstrel said aloud．“There's something in it somewhere，but what it is and where，I cannot think．”He wondered if the Duke would order him to cause a fall of purple snow，or make a table out of sawdust，or merely slit him from his guggle to his zatch，and say to Saralinda，“There he lies，your latest fool，a nameless minstrel．I'll have my valets feed him to the geese．”The minstrel shuddered in the moonlight，wondering where his zatch and guggle were．He wondered how and why and when he could invade the castle．A duke was never known to ask a ragged minstrel to his table，or set a task for him to do，or let him meet a princess．“I'll think of some way，”thought the Prince．“I'll think of something．”

The hour was late，and revelers began to reel and stagger home from inns and taverns，none in rags，and none in tags，and some in velvet gowns．One third of the dogs in town began to bark．The minstrel took his lute from his shoulder and improvised a song．He had thought of something．

“Hark，hark，the dogs do bark，

But only one in three．

They bark at those in velvet gowns，

They never bark at me．”

A tale-teller，tottering home to bed，laughed at the song，and troublemakers and tosspots began to gather and listen．

“The Duke is fond of velvet gowns，

He'll ask you all to tea．

But I'm in rags，and I'm in tags，

He'll never send for me．”

The townspeople crowded around the minstrel，laughing and cheering．“He's a bold one，Rags is，makin' songs about the Duke！”giggled a strutfurrow who had joined the crowd．The minstrel went on singing．

“Hark，hark，the dogs do bark，

The Duke is fond of kittens．

He likes to take their insides out，

And use their fur for mittens．”

The crowd fell silent in awe and wonder，for the townspeople knew the Duke had slain eleven men for merely staring at his hands，hands that were gloved in velvet gloves，bright with rubies and with diamonds．Fearing to be seen in the doomed and desperate company of the mad minstrel，the revelers slunk off to their homes to tell their wives．Only the traveler，who thought he had seen the singer some otherwhere and time，lingered to warn him of his peril．“I've seen you shining in the lists，”he said，“or topping knights in battle，or breaking men in two like crackers．You must be Tristam's son，or Lancelot's，or are you Tyne or Tora？”

“A wandering minstrel，I，”the minstrel said，“a thing of shreds and zatches．”He bit his tongue in consternation at the slip it made．

“Even if you were the mighty Zorn of Zorna，”said the man，“you could not escape the fury of the Duke．He'll slit you from your guggle to your zatch，from here to here．”He touched the minstrel's stomach and his throat．

“I now know what to guard，”the minstrel sighed．

A black figure in velvet mask and hood and cloak disappeared behind a tree．“The cold Duke's spy-in-chief，”the traveler said，“a man named Whisper．Tomorrow he will die．”

The minstrel waited．“He'll die because，to name your sins，he'll have to mention mittens．I leave at once for other lands，since I have mentioned mittens．”He sighed．“You'll never live to wed his niece．You'll only die to feed his geese．Goodbye，good night，and sorry．”

The traveler vanished，like a fly in the mouth of a frog，and the minstrel was left alone in the dark，deserted street．Somewhere a clock dropped a stony chime into the night．The minstrel began to sing again．A soft finger touched his shoulder and he turned to see a little man smiling in the moonlight．He wore an indescribable hat，his eyes were wide and astonished，as if everything were happening for the first time，and he had a dark，describable beard．“If you have nothing better than your songs，”he said，“you are somewhat less than much，and only a little more than anything．”

“I manage in my fashion，”the minstrel said，and he strummed his lute and sang．

“Hark，hark，the dogs do bark，

The cravens are going to bed．

Some will rise and greet the sun，

But Whisper will be dead．”

The old man lost his smile．

“Who are you？”the minstrel asked．

“I am the Golux，”said the Golux，proudly，“the only Golux in the world，and not a mere Device．”

“You resemble one，”the minstrel said，“as Saralinda resembles the rose．”

“I resemble only half the things I say I don't，”the Golux said．“The other half resemble me．”He sighed．“I must always be on hand when people are in peril．”

“My peril is my own，”the minstrel said．

“Half of it is yours and half is Saralinda's．”

“I hadn't thought of that，”the minstrel said．“I place my faith in you，and where you lead，I follow．”

“Not so fast，”the Golux said．“Half the places I have been to，never were．I make things up．Half the things I say are there cannot be found．When I was young I told a tale of buried gold，and men from leagues around dug in the woods．I dug myself．”

“But why？”

“I thought the tale of treasure might be true．”

“You said you made it up．”

“I know I did，then but I didn't know I had．I forget things，too．”The minstrel felt a vague uncertainty．“I make mistakes，but I am on the side of Good，”the Golux said，“by accident and happenchance．I had high hopes of being Evil when I was two，but in my youth I came upon a firefly burning in a spider's web．I saved the victim's life．”

“The firefly's？”said the minstrel．

“The spider's．The blinking arsonist had set the web on fire．”The minstrel's uncertainty increased，but as he thought to slip away，a deep bell sounded in the castle and many lights appeared，and voices shouted orders and commands．A stream of lanterns started flowing down the darkness．“The Duke has heard your songs，”the Golux said．“The fat is in the fire，the die is cast，the jig is up，the goose is cooked，and the cat is out of the bag．”

“My hour has struck，”the minstrel said．They heard a faint and distant rasping sound，as if a blade of steel were being sharpened on a stone．

“The Duke prepares to feed you to his geese，”the Golux said．“We must invent a tale to stay his hand．”

“What manner of tale？”the minstrel asked．

“A tale，”the Golux said，“to make the Duke believe that slaying you would light a light in someone else's heart．He hates a light in people's hearts．So you must say a certain prince and princess can't be wed until the evening of the second day after the Duke has fed you to the geese．”

“I wish that you would not keep saying that，”the minstrel said．

“The tale sounds true，”the Golux said，“and very like a witch's spell．The Duke has awe of witches’ spells．I'm certain he will stay his hand，I think．”

The sound of tramping feet came near and nearer．The iron guards of the Duke closed in，their lanterns gleaming and their spears and armor．“Halt！”There was a clang and clanking．

“Do not arrest my friend，”the youth implored．

“What friend？”the captain growled．

The minstrel looked around him and about，but there was no one there．A guard guffawed and said，“Maybe he's seen the Golux．”

“There isn't any Golux．I have been to school，and I know，”the captain said．The minstrel's uncertainty increased again．“Fall in！”the captain bawled．“Dress up that line．”

“You heard him．Dress it up，”the sergeant said．They marched the minstrel to the dungeon in the castle．A stream of lantern light flowed slowly up the hill．





Ⅲ


It was morning．The cold Duke gazed out a window of the castle，as if he were watching flowers in bloom or flying birds．He was watching his valets feeding Whisper to the geese．He turned away and took three limps and stared at the minstrel，standing in the great hall of the castle，both hands bound behind him．“What manner of prince is this you speak of，and what manner of maiden does he love，to use a word that makes no sense and has no point？”His voice sounded like iron dropped on velvet．

“A noble prince，a noble lady，”the minstrel said．“When they are wed a million people will be glad．”

The Duke took his sword out of his sword-cane and stared at it．He limped across and faced his captive，and touched his guggle softly with the point，and touched his zatch，and sighed and frowned，and put the sword away．“We shall think of some amusing task for you to do，”he said．“I do not like your tricks and guile．I think there is no prince or maiden who would wed if I should slay you，but I am neither sure nor certain．”He grinned and said again，“We'll think of some amusing task for you to do．”

“But I am not a prince，”the minstrel said，“and only princes may aspire to Saralinda's hand．”

The cold Duke kept on grinning．“Why，then，we'll make a prince of you，”he said．“The prince of Rags and Jingles．”He clapped his gloves together and two varlets appeared without a word or sound．“Take him to his dungeon，”said the Duke．“Feed him water without bread，and bread without water．”

The valets were taking the minstrel out of the great hall when down the marble stairs the princess Saralinda floated like a cloud．The Duke's eye gleamed like crystal．The minstrel gazed in wonder．The Princess Saralinda was tall，with freesias in her dark hair，and she wore serenity brightly like the rainbow．It was not easy to tell her mouth from the rose，or her brow from the white lilac．Her voice was faraway music，and her eyes were candles burning on a tranquil night．She moved across the room like wind in violets，and her laughter sparkled on the air，which，from her presence，gained a faint and undreamed fragrance．The Prince was frozen by her beauty，but not cold，and the Duke，who was cold but not frozen，held up the palms of his gloves，as if she were a fire at which to warm his hands．The minstrel saw the blood come warmly to the lame man's cheeks．“This thing of rags and tags and tatters will play our little game，”he told his niece，his voice like iron on velvet．

“I wish him well，”the Princess said．

The minstrel broke his bonds and took her hand in his，but it was slashed away by the swift cane of the Duke．“Take him to the dungeon now，”he said．He stared coldly at the minstrel through his monocle．“You'll find the most amusing bats and spiders there．”

“I wish him well，”the Princess said again，and the valets took the minstrel to his dungeon．

When the great iron door of the dungeon clanked behind the minstrel，he found himself alone in blackness．A spider，swinging on a strand of web，swung back and forth．The zickering of bats was echoed by the walls．The minstrel took a step，avoiding snakes，and something squirmed．“Take care，”the Golux said，“you're on my foot．”

“Why are you here？”the minstrel cried．

“I forgot something．I forgot about the task the Duke will set you．”

The minstrel thought of swimming lakes too wide to swim，of turning liquids into stone，or finding boneless creatures made of bone．“How came you here？”he asked．“And can you leave？”

“I never know，”the Golux said．“My mother was a witch，but rather mediocre in her way．When she tried to turn a thing to gold，it turned to clay，and when she changed her rivals into fish，all she ever got was mermaids．”The minstrel's heart was insecure．“My father was a wizard，”said his friend，“who often cast his spells upon himself，when he was in his cups．Strike a light or light a lantern！ Something I have hold of has no head．”

The minstrel shuddered．“The task，”he said．“You came to tell me．”

“I did？ Oh，yes．My father lacked the power of concentration，and that is bad for monks and priests，and worse for wizards．Listen．Tell the Duke that you will hunt the Boar，or travel thrice around the moon，or turn November into June．Implore him not to send you out to find a thousand jewels．”

“And then？”

“And then he'll send you out to find a thousand jewels．”

“But I am poor！”the minstrel cried．

“Come，come，”the Golux said．“You're Zorn of Zorna．I had it from a traveler I met．It came to him as he was leaving town．Your father's casks and coffers shine with rubies and with sapphires．”

“My father lives in Zorna，”said the Prince，“and it would take me nine and ninety days：three and thirty days to go，and three and thirty days to come back here．”

“That's six and sixty．”

“It always takes my father three and thirty days to make decisions，”said the Prince．“In spells and labors a certain time is always set，and I might be at sea when mine expires．”

“That's another problem for another day，”the Golux said．“Time is for dragonflies and angels．The former live too little and the latter live too long．”

Zorn of Zorna thought awhile and said，“The task seems strange and simple．”

“There are no jewels，”the Golux said，“within the reach and ranges of this island，except the gems here in this castle．The Duke knows not that you are Zorn of Zorna．He thinks you are a minstrel without a penny or a moonstone．He's fond of jewels．You've seen them on his gloves．”

The Prince stepped on a turtle．“The Duke has spies，”he said，“who may know who I am．”

The Golux sighed．“I may be wrong，”he said，“but we must risk and try it．”

The Prince sighed in his turn．“I wish you could be surer．”

“I wish I could，”the Golux said．“My mother was born，I regret to say，only partly in a caul．I've saved a score of princes in my time．I cannot save them all．”Something that would have been purple，if there had been light to see it by，scuttled across the floor．“The Duke might give me only thirty days，or forty-two，to find a thousand jewels，”said Zorn of Zorna．“Why should he give me ninety-nine？”

“The way I figure it，”the Golux said，“is this．The longer the labor lasts，the longer lasts his gloating．He loves to gloat，you know．”

The Prince sat down beside a toad．“My father may have lost his jewels，”he said，“or given them away．”

“I thought of that，”the Golux said．“But I have other plans than one．Right now we have to sleep．”

They found a corner without creatures and slept until the town clock struck the midnight hour．

Chains clanked and rattled，and the great iron door began to move．“The Duke has sent for you again，”the Golux said．“Be careful what you say and what you do．”

The great iron door began to open slowly．“When shall I see you next？”Zorn whispered．There was no answer．The Prince groped around in the dark and felt a thing very like a cat，and touched the thing without a head，but he could not find the Golux．

The great iron door was open wide now and the dungeon filled with lantern light．

“The Duke commands your presence，”growled a guard．“What was that？”

“What was what？”

“I know not，”said the guard．“I thought I heard the sound of someone laughing．”

“Is the Duke afraid of laughter？”asked the Prince．

“The Duke is not afraid of anything．Not even，”said the guard，“the Todal．”

“The Todal？”

“The Todal．”

“What's the Todal？”

A lock of the guard's hair turned white and his teeth began to chatter．“The Todal looks like a blob of glup，”he said．“It makes a sound like rabbits screaming，and smells of old，unopened rooms．It's waiting for the Duke to fail in some endeavor，such as setting you a task that you can do．”

“And if he sets me one，and I succeed？”the Prince inquired．

“The Blob will glup him，”said the guard．“It's an agent of the devil，sent to punish evil-doers for having done less evil than they should．I talk too much．Come on．The Duke is waiting．”





Ⅳ


The Duke sat at one end of a black oak table in the black oak room，lighted by flaming torches that threw red gleams on shields and lances．The Duke's gloves sparkled when he moved his hands．He stared moodily through his monocle at young Prince Zorn．The Duke sneered，which made him even colder．“So you would hunt the Boar，”he said，“or travel thrice around the moon，or turn November into June．”He laughed，and a torch went out．“Saralinda in November turns November into June．A cow can travel thrice around the moon，or even more．And anyone can merely hunt the Boar．I Have another plan for you．I thought it up myself last night，while I was killing mice．I'll send you out to find a thousand jewels and bring them back．”

The Prince turned pale，or tried to．“A wandering minstrel，I，”he said，“a thing of—”

“Rubies and sapphires．”The Duke's chuckle sounded like ice cackling in a cauldron．“For you are Zorn of Zorna，”he whispered，softly．“Your father's casks and vaults and coffers shine with jewels．In six and sixty days you could sail to Zorna and return．”

“It always takes my father three and thirty days to make decisions，”cried the Prince．

The Duke grinned．“That is what I wanted to know，my naive Prince，”he said．“Then you would have me give you nine and ninety days？”

“That would be fair，”the Prince replied．“But how do you know that I am Zorn？”

“I have a spy named Hark，”the Duke explained，“who found your princely raiment in your quarters in the town and brought it here，with certain signs and seals and signatures，revealing who you are．Go put the raiment on．”He pointed at a flight of iron stairs．“You'll find it in a chamber on whose door a star is turning black．Don it and return．I'll think of beetles while you're gone，and things like that．”The Duke limped to his chair and sat down again，and the Prince started up the iron stairs，wondering where the Golux was．He stopped and turned and said，“You will not give me nine and ninety days．How many，then？”The Duke sneered．“I'll think of a lovely number，”he said．“Go on．”

When Zorn came back he wore his royal attire，but the Duke's spies had sealed his sword，so that he could not draw it．The Duke sat staring at a man who wore a velvet mask and cloak and hood．“This is Hark，”he said，“and this is Listen．”He gestured with his cane at nothing．

“There's no one there，”said Zorn．

“Listen is invisible，”the Duke explained．“Listen can be heard，but never seen．They are here to learn the mark and measure of your task．I give you nine and ninety hours，not nine and ninety days，to find a thousand jewels and bring them here．When you return，the clocks must all be striking five．”

“The clocks here in the castle？”asked the Prince．“The thirteen clocks？”

“The clocks here in the castle？”said the Duke，“the thirteen clocks．”

The Prince looked at the two clocks on the walls．Their hands pointed to ten minutes of five．“The hands are frozen，”said the Prince．“The clocks are dead．”

“Precisely，”said the Duke，“and what is more，which makes your task a charming one，there are no jewels that could be found within the space of nine and ninety hours，except those in my vaults，and these．”He held his gloves up and they sparkled．

“A pretty task，”said Hark．

“Ingenious，”said the voice of Listen．

“I thought you'd like it，”said the Duke．“Unseal his sword．”Invisible hands unsealed the Prince's sword．

“And if I should succeed？”asked Zorn．

The Duke waved a gloved hand at the iron stairs，and Zorn saw Saralinda standing there．“I wish him well，”she said，and her uncle laughed and looked at Zorn．“I hired a witch，”he said，“to cast a tiny spell upon her．When she is in my presence，all that she can say is this：‘I wish him well.’ You like it？”

“A clever spell，”said Hark．

“An awful spell，”the voice of Listen said．

The Prince and Princess spoke a silent language with their eyes，until the Duke cried，“Go！”and Saralinda vanished up the stairs．

“And if I fail？”asked Zorn．

The Duke removed his sword from his sword-cane and ran his glove along the blade．“I'll slit you from your guggle to your zatch，and feed you to the Todal．”

“I've heard of it，”said Zorn．

The Duke smiled．“You've only heard of half of it，”he said．“The other half is worse．It's made of lip．It feels as if it had been dead at least a dozen days，but it moves about like monkeys and like shadows．”The Prince took out his sword and put it back．“The Todal can't be killed，”the Duke said，softly．

“It gleeps，”said Hark．

“What's gleeping？”asked the Prince．

The Duke and Hark and Listen laughed．“Time is wasting，Prince，”the Duke reminded him．“Already you have only eight and ninety hours．I wish you every strangest kind of luck．”A wide oak door suddenly opened at the end of the room，and the Prince saw lightning and midnight and falling rain．“One last word of warning，”said the Duke．“I would not trust the Golux overfar．He cannot tell what can be from what can't．He seldom knows what should be from what is．”

The Prince glanced at Hark and at the Duke，and at a spot where he thought Listen stood．“When all the clocks are striking five，”he said，and left the room．The laughter of the Duke and Hark and Listen followed him out the door and down the stairs and into the darkness．When he had gone a few steps from the castle，he looked up at a lighted window and thought he saw the Princess Saralinda standing there．A rose fell at his feet，and as he picked it up，the laughter of the Duke and Hark and Listen increased inside the black oak room and died away．





Ⅴ


The Prince had gone but a short way from the castle when he felt a gentle finger touch his elbow．“It is the Golux，”said the Golux，proudly．“The only Golux in the world．”

The Prince was in no mood for the old man's gaiety and cheer．The Golux did not seem wonderful to him now，and even his indescribable hat was suddenly describable．“The Duke thinks you are not so wise as he thinks you think you are，”he said．

The Golux smiled．“I think he is not so wise as he thinks I think he is，”he said．“I was there．I know the terms．I had thought that only dragonflies and angels think of time，never having been an angel or a dragonfly．”

“How were you there？”the Prince said in surprise．

“I am Listen，”the Golux said，“or at any rate，he thinks I am．Never trust a spy you cannot see．The Duke is lamer than I am old，and I am shorter than he is cold，but it comes to you with some surprise that I am wiser than he is wise．”

The Prince's courage began to return．“I think you are the most remarkable man in the world，”he said．

“Who thought not so a moment since，knows not the apple from the quince，”the Golux said．He scowled．“We now have only eight and ninety hours to find a thousand gems，”he said．

“You said that you had other plans than one，”the Prince reminded him．

“What plans？”the Golux asked．

“You didn't say，”said Zorn．

The Golux closed his eyes and clasped his hands．“There was a treasure ship that sank，not more than forty hours from here，”he said．“But，come to think of it，the Duke ransacked the ship and stole the jewels．”

“So much，”sighed Zorn，“for that．”

The Golux thought again．“If there were hail，”he said，“and we could stain the hail with blood，it might turn into rubies．”

“There is no hail，”said Zorn．

The Golux sighed．“So much，”he said，“for that．”

“The task is hard，”said Zorn，“and can't be done．”

“I can do a score of things that can't be done，”the Golux said．“I can find a thing I cannot see and see a thing I cannot find．The first is time，the second is a spot before my eyes．I can feel a thing I cannot touch and touch a thing I cannot feel．The first is sad and sorry，the second is your heart．What would you do without me？ Say ‘nothing.’”

“Nothing，”said the Prince．

“Good．Then you're helpless and I'll help you．I said I had another plan than one，and I have just remembered what it is．There is a woman on this isle，who'd have some eight and eighty years，and she is gifted with the strangest gift of all．For when she weeps，what do you think she weeps？”

“Tears，”said Zorn．

“Jewels，”said the Golux．

The Prince stared at him．“But that is too remarkable to be，”he said．

“I don't see why，”the Golux said．“Even the lowly oyster makes his pearls without the use of eyes or hands or any tools，and pearls are jewels．The oyster is a blob of glup，but a woman is a woman．”

The Prince thought of the Todal and felt a small cold feeling in his guggle．“Where does this wondrous woman dwell？”he asked．

The old man groaned．“Over mountain，over stream，by the way of storm and thunder，in a hut so high or deep—I never can remember which—the naked eye can't see it．”He stood up．“We must be on our way，”he said．“It will take us ninety hours，or more or less，to go and come．It's this way，or it's that way．Make up my mind．”

“How can I？”asked the Prince．“You have a rose，”the Golux said．“Hold it in your hand．”The Prince took out the rose and held it in his hand，and its stem slowly turned and stopped．“It's this way，”cried the Golux，and they started off in the direction the stem of the rose had pointed out．“I will tell you the tale of Hagga，”said the Golux．

When Hagga was eleven （he began） and picking cherries in the woods one day，and asphodel，she came upon the good King Gwain of Yarrow with his foot caught in a wolf trap．“Weep for me，maiden，”said the King，“for I am ludicrous and laughable，with my foot caught in this trap．I am no longer ert，for I have lost my ertia．By twiddling my fingers or clapping my hands，I have often changed the fate of men，but now I cannot get my foot loose from this thing．”

“I have no time for tears，”the maiden said．She knew the secret of the trap，and was about to free the fettered foot，when a farmer from a near-by farm began to laugh．The King beshrewed him and his wife，and turned them into grasshoppers，creatures that look as if their feet were caught in traps，even when they aren't．

“Lo，the maid has freed my foot，”the King exulted，seeing that she had，“but it is numb，and feels like someone else's foot，not mine．”The maiden took off his shoe and rubbed his foot，until it felt like his and he could put it down．And for her kindness the grateful King gave her the power to weep jewels when she wept，instead of tears．When the people learned of the strange gift the King had given Hagga，they came from leagues around，by night and day，in warm and winter weather，to make her sad and sorry．Nothing tragic happened but she heard of it and wept．People came with heavy hearts and left with pearls and rubies．Paths were paved with pearls，and rivers ran with rubies．Children played with sapphires in the streets，and dogs chewed opals．Every peacock had at least nine diamonds in its gizzard，and one，cut open on St．Wistow's Day，had thirty-eight．The price of stones and pebbles rose，the price of gems declined，until，by making Hagga weep，you could be hanged and fined．In the end，the jewels were melted，in a frightful fire，by order of the King．“I will make her weep myself，one day each year，”the King decreed，“and thus and hence，the flow of gems will make some sense，and have some point and balance．”But alas，and but alack，the maid could weep no more at any tale of tragedy or tribulation．Damsels killed by dragons left her cold，and broken hearts，and children lost，and love denied．She never wept by day or night，in warm or winter weather．She grew to be sixteen，and twenty-six，and thirty-four，and forty-eight，and fifty-two and now she waits，at eighty-eight，for me and you．“I hope，”the Golux said，“that this is true．I make things up，you know．”

The young Prince sighed and said，“I know you do．If Hagga weeps no more，why should she weep for you？”

The Golux thought it over．“I feel that she is frail and fragile．I trust that she is sad and sorry．I hope that she is neither dead nor dying．I'll think of something very sad to tell her．Very sad and lonely．Take out your rose，I think we're lost．”

They had become tangled in brambles by now，and the trees of the forest they had entered were tall and thick．Thorns began to tear the Prince's raiment．Lightning flashed and thunder rolled，and all paths vanished．The Prince took out the rose and held it in his hand．The stem began to turn and twist，and pointed．

“Around this way，”the Golux said．“It's lighter here．”He found a narrow path that led straight onward．As they walked along the path，the Golux leading，they met a Jackadandy，whose clothes were torn and tattered．

“I told my tales to Hagga，”said the man；“but Hagga weeps no more．I told her tales of lovers lost in April．I told her tales of maidens dead in June．I told her tales of princes fed to geese．I even told her how I lost my youngest niece．”

“This is sad，”the Golux said，“and getting sadder．”

“The way is long，”the torn man said，“and getting longer．The road goes uphill all the way，and even farther．I wish you luck，”he said．“You'll need it．”He disappeared in brambles．

The only light in the forest came from lightning，and when it flashed they watched the rose and followed where it pointed．This brought them，on the second day，into a valley．They saw a Jack-o'-lent approaching，his clothes all torn and tattered．“I told my tales to Hagga，”said the man，“but Hagga weeps no more．I told her tales of lovers lost at sea and drowned in fountains．I told her tales of babies lost in woods and lost on mountains．She wept not，”said the Jack-o'-lent．“The way is dark，and getting darker．The hut is high and even higher．I wish you luck．There is none．”He vanished in the briars．

The brambles and the thorns grew thick and thicker in a ticking thicket of bickering crickets．Farther along and stronger，bonged the gongs of a throng of frogs，green and vivid on their lily pads．From the sky came the crying of flies，and the pilgrims leaped over a bleating sheep creeping knee-deep in a sleepy stream，in which swift and slippery snakes slid and slithered silkily，whispering sinful secrets．

A comet whistled through the sky，and by its light they saw the hut of Hagga high on Hagga's hill．“If she is dead，there may be strangers there，”the Golux said．

“How many hours do we have left？”the Prince demanded．

“If we can make her weep within the hour，”the Golux said，“we'll barely make it．”

“I hope that she's alive and sad，”said Zorn．

“I feel that she has died，”the Golux sighed．“I feel it in my stomach．You better carry me．I'm weary．”

Zorn of Zorna picked the Golux up and carried him．





Ⅵ


It was cold on Hagga's hill，and fresh with furrows where the dragging points of stars had plowed the fields．A peasant in a purple smock stalked the smoking furrows，sowing seeds．There was a smell，the Golux thought，a little like Forever in the air，but mixed with something faint and less enduring，possibly the fragrance of a flower．“There's no light in her window，”the Golux said，“and it is dark and getting darker．”

“There's no smoke in her chimney，”said the Prince，“and it is cold and getting colder．”

The Golux barely breathed and said，“What worries me the most is that spider's web there on the door，that stretches from the hinges to the latch．”

The young Prince felt a hollow feeling in his zatch．“Knock on her door，”the Golux said，his voice so high it quavered．He crossed his fingers and kept them crossed，and Zorn knocked on the door．No one answered．“Knock again，”the Golux cried，and Prince Zorn knocked again．

Hagga was there．She came to the door and stared at them，a woman neither dead nor dying，and clearly only thirty-eight or thirty-nine．The Golux had missed her age by fifty years，as old men often do．“Weep for us，”the Golux cried，“or else this Prince will never wed his Princess．”

“I have no tears，”said Hagga．“Once I wept when ships were overdue，or brooks ran dry，or tangerines were overripe，or sheep got something in their eye．I weep no more，”said Hagga．Her eyes were dry as deserts and her mouth seemed made of stone．“I have turned a thousand persons gemless from my door．Come in，”she said．“I weep no more．”

The room was dark and held a table and a chair，and in one corner something like a chest，made of oak and bound with brass．The Golux smiled and then looked sad，and said，“I have tales to make a hangman weep，and tales to bring a tear of sorrow to a monster's eye．I have tales that would disturb a dragon's sleep，and even make the Todal sigh．”

At the mention of the Todal，Hagga's hair turned gray．“Once I wept when maids were married underneath the April moon．I weep no more when maids are buried，even in the month of June．”

“You have the emotions of a fish，”said the Golux，irritably．He sat on the floor and told her tales of the death of kings，and kindred things，and little children choked by rings．

“I have no tears，”said Hagga．

He told her tales of the frogs in the forum，and the toads in the rice that destroyed the poppycockalorum and the cockahoopatrice．

“I weep no more，”said Hagga．

“Look，”the Golux said，“and listen！ The Princess Saralinda will never wed this youth until the day he lays a thousand jewels upon a certain table．”

“I would weep for Saralinda，”Hagga sighed，“if I were able．”

The Prince had wandered to the oaken chest．He seized its cover with his hand and threw it open．A radiance filled the room and lit the darkest corners．Inside the chest there were at least ten thousand jewels of the very sort and kind the Duke demanded．Diamonds flared and rubies glowed，and sapphires burned and emeralds seemed on fire．They looked at Hagga．“These are the jewels of laughter，”Hagga said．“I woke up fourteen days ago to find them on my bed．I had laughed until I wept at something in my sleep．”The Golux grabbed a gleaming handful of the gems，and then another，crowing with delight．“Put them back，”said Hagga．“For there's a thing that you must know，concerning jewels of laughter．They always turn again to tears a fortnight after．It has been a fortnight，to the day and minute，since I took the pretties to this chest and put them in it．”

Even as they watched，the light and color died．The diamonds dimmed，the emeralds went out，and the jewels of Hagga's laughter turned to tears，with a little sound like sighing．There was nothing in the chest but limpid liquid，leering up at them and winking．“You must think，”the Golux cried．“You must think of what you laughed at in your sleep．”

Hagga's eyes were blank．“I do not know，for this was fourteen days ago．”

“Think！”the Golux said．

“Think！”said Zorn of Zorna．

Hagga frowned and said，“I never can remember dreams．”

The Golux clasped his hands behind his back and thought it over．“As I remember and recall，”he said，“the jewels of sorrow last forever．Such was the gift and power the good Gwain gave you．What was he doing，by the way，so many leagues from Yarrow？”

“Hunting，”Hagga said．“Wolves，as I recall it．”

The Golux scowled．“I am a man of logic，in my way．What happened on that awful day，to make him value sorrow over and above the gift of laughter？ Why have these jewels turned to tears a fortnight after？”

“There was a farmer from a near-by farm，who laughed，”said Hagga．“‘On second thought，’ the good King said，‘I will amend and modify the gift I gave you．The jewels of sorrow will last beyond all measure，but may the jewels of laughter give you little pleasure.’”

The Golux groaned．“If there's one thing in the world I hate，”he said，“it is amendments．”His eyes turned bright and brighter，and he clapped his hands．“I will make her laugh until she weeps，”he said．

The Golux told her funny tales of things that were and had been，but Hagga's eyes were dry as quartz and her mouth seemed made of agate．“I laugh at nothing that has been，”she said，“or is．”

The Golux smiled．“Then we will think of things that will be，and aren't now，and never were．I'll think of something，”and he thought，and thought of something．

“A dehoy who was terribly hobble，

Cast only stones that were cobble

And bats that were ding，

From a shot that was sling，

But never hit inks that were bobble．”

Hagga laughed until she wept，and seven moonstones trickled down her cheek and clattered on the floor．“She's weeping semiprecious stones！”the Golux wailed．He tried again：

“There was an old coddle so molly，

He talked in a glot that was poly，

His gaws were so gew

That his laps became dew

And he ate only pops that were lolly．”

Hagga laughed until she wept，and seven brilliants trickled down her cheek and clattered on the floor．“Rhinestones！”groaned the Golux．“Now she's weeping costume jewelry！”

The young Prince tried his hand at telling tales of laughter，but for his pains he got a shower of tourmaline，a cat's-eye，and a flux of pearls．“The Duke hates pearls，”the Golux moaned．“He thinks they're made by fish．”

It grew darker in the room and they could scarcely see．The starlight and the moon were gone．They stood there，still as statues．The Golux cleared his throat．The Prince uncrossed his arms and crossed them．And then，without a rhyme or reason，out of time and out of season，Hagga laughed and kept on laughing．No one had said a word，no one had told a tale．It might have been the hooting of an owl．It might have been the crawling of a snail．But Hagga laughed and kept on laughing，and precious jewels twinkled down her cheek and sparkled on the floor，until the hut was ankle-deep in diamonds and in rubies．The Golux counted out a thousand and put them in a velvet sack that he had brought along．“I wish that she had laughed，”he sighed，“at something I had said．”

Zorn of Zorna took her hand．“God keep you warm in winter，”said the Prince，“and cool in summer．”

“Farewell，”the Golux said，“and thank you．”

Hagga laughed and kept on laughing，and sapphires burned upon the floor and lit the Golux toward the door．

“How many hours are left us now？”the young Prince cried．

“It's odd，”the Golux muttered to himself．“I could have sworn that she had died．This is the only time my stomach ever lied．”

“How many hours are left us now？”the Prince implored．

Hagga sat upon the chest and kept on laughing．

“I should say，”the Golux said，“that we have only forty left，but it is downhill all the way．”

They went out into the moonless night and peered about them in the dark．

“I think it's this way，”the Golux said，and they went the way he thought it was．

“What about the clocks？”demanded Zorn．

The Golux exhaled a sorry breath．“That's another problem for another hour，”he said．

Inside the hut，something red and larger than a ruby glowed among the jewels and Hagga picked it up．“A rose，”she said．“They must have dropped it．”





Ⅶ


In the black oak room the yellow torches flared and crackled on the walls，and their fire burned on the lances and the shields．The Duke's gloves glittered．“How goes the night？”he gnarled．

“The moon is down，”said Hark．“I have not heard the clocks．”

“You'll never hear them！”screamed the Duke．“I slew time in this castle many a cold and snowy year ago．”

Hark stared at him emptily and seemed to be chewing something．“Time froze here．Someone left the windows open．”

“Bah！”The Duke sat down at the far end of the table，stood up again，and limped about．“It bled hours and minutes on the floor．I saw it with my eye．”Hark kept on chewing something．Outside the Gothic windows thunder growled．An owl flew by．

“There are no jewels，”roared the Duke．“They'll have to bring me pebbles from the sea or mica from the meadows．”He gave his awful laugh．“How goes the night？”he asked again．

“I have been counting off and on，”said Hark，“and I should say they have some forty minutes left．”

“They'll never make it！”the cold Duke screamed．“I hope they drowned，or broke their legs，or lost their way．”He came so close to Hark their noses almost touched．“Where were they going？”he whispered harshly．

Hark stepped backward seven steps．“I met a Jackadandy，some seven hours ago，”he said．“They passed him on their way to Hagga's hill．Do you remember Hagga，and have you thought of her？”

The Duke's loud laughter rang the shields．

“Hagga weeps no more，”he said．“Hagga has no tears．She did not even weep when she was told about the children locked up in my tower．”

“I hated that，”said Hark．

“I liked it，”said the Duke．“No child can sleep in my camellias．”He began to limp again and stared out at the night．“Where is Listen？”he demanded．

“He followed them，”said Hark，“the Golux and the Prince．”

“I do not trust him，”growled the Duke．“I like a spy that I can see．Let me have men about me that are visible．”He shouted “Listen！”up the stairs，and “Listen！”out the windows，but no one answered．“I'm cold，”he rasped．

“You always are．”

“I'm colder，”snarled the Duke，“and never tell me what I always am！”He took his sword out and slashed at nothing and at silence．“I miss Whisper．”

“You fed him to the geese，”said Hark．“They seemed to like him．”

“Silence！ What was that？”

“What did it sound like？”

“Like princes stealing up the stairs，like Saralinda leaving．”The Duke limped to the iron stairs and slashed again at silence and at nothing．“What does he feel like？ Have you felt him？”

“Listen？ He's five feet high，”said Hark．“He has a beard，and something on his head I can't describe．”

“The Golux！”shrieked the Duke．“You felt the Golux！ I hired him as a spy and didn't know it．”

A purple ball with gold stars on it came slowly bouncing down the iron stairs and winked and twinkled，like a naked child saluting priests．“What insolence is this？”the Duke demanded．“What is that thing？”

“A ball，”said Hark．

“I know that！”screamed the Duke．“But why？ What does its ghastly presence signify？”

“It looks to me，”said Hark，“very like a ball the Golux and those children used to play with．”

“They're on his side！”The Duke was apoplectic．“Their ghosts are on his side．”

“He has a lot of friends，”said Hark．

“Silence！”roared the Duke．“He knows not what is dead from what is dying，or where he's been from where he's going，or striking clocks from clocks that never strike．”

“What makes me think he does？”The spy stopped chewing．Something very much like nothing anyone had seen before came trotting down the stairs and crossed the room．

“What is that？”the Duke asked，palely．

“I don't know what it is，”said Hark，“but it's the only one there ever was．”

The Duke's gloved hands shook and shimmered．“I'll throw them up for grabs betwixt the Todal and the geese！ I'll lock them in the dungeon with the thing without a head！”At the mention of the Todal，Hark's velvet mask turned gray．The Duke's eye twisted upward in its socket．“I'll slay them all！”he said．“This sweetheart and her suitor，this cross-eyed clown！ You hear me？”

“Yes，”said Hark，“but there are rules and rites and rituals，older than the sound of bells and snow on mountains．”

“Go on，”the Duke said，softly，looking up the stairs．

“You must let them have their time and turn to make the castle clocks strike five．”

“The castle clocks were murdered，”said the Duke．“I killed time here myself one snowy morning．You can still see the old brown stains，where seconds bled to death，here on my sleeve．”He laughed．“What else？”he asked．

“You know as well as I，”said Hark．“The Prince must have his turn and time to lay a thousand jewels there on the table．”

“And if he does？”

“He wins the hand of Princess Saralinda．”

“The only warm hand in the castle，”said the Duke．“Who loses Saralinda loses fire．I mean the fire of the setting suns，and not the cold and cheerless flame of jewels．Her eyes are candles burning in a shrine．Her feet appear to me as doves．Her fingers bloom upon her breast like flowers．”

“This is scarcely the way，”said Hark，“to speak of one's own niece．”

“She's not my niece！ I stole her！”cried the Duke．“I stole her from the castle of a king！ I snatched her from the bosom of a sleeping queen．I still bear on my hands the marks of where she bit me．”

“The Queen？”asked Hark．

“The Princess，”roared the Duke．

“Who was the King？”asked Hark．

His master scowled．“I never knew，”he said．“My ship was beached upon an island in a storm．There was no moon or any star．No lights were in the castle．”

“How could you find the Princess then？”asked Hark．

“She had a radiance，”said the Duke．“She shone there like a star upon her mother's breast．I knew I had to have that splendor in my castle．I mean to keep her here till she is twenty-one．The day she is，I'll wed her，and that day is tomorrow．”

“Why haven't you before？”asked Hark．“This castle is your kingdom．”

The Duke smiled and showed his upper teeth．“Because her nurse turned out to be a witch who cast a spell upon me．”

“What were its terms？”asked Hark．

“I cannot wed her till the day she's twenty-one，and that day is tomorrow．”

“You said that once before．”

“I must keep her in a chamber where she is safe from me．I've done that．”

“I like that part，”said Hark．

“I hate it，”snarled the Duke．“I must give and grant the right to any prince to seek her hand in marriage．I've done that，too．”He sat down at the table．

“In spells of this sort，”Hark said，chewing，“one always finds a chink or loophole，by means of which the right and perfect prince can win her hand in spite of any task you set him．How did the witch announce that part of it？”

“Like this．‘She can be saved，and you destroyed，only by a prince whose name begins with X and doesn't.’ There is no prince whose name begins with X and doesn't．”

Hark's mask slipped off and he put it back again，but not before the Duke saw laughter in his eyes．“This prince，”said Hark，“is Zorn of Zorna，but to your terror and distaste，he once posed as a minstrel．His name was Xingu then and wasn't．This is the prince whose name begins with X and doesn't．”

The Duke's sword had begun to shake．“Nobody ever tells me anything，”he whispered to himself．

Another ball came bouncing down the stairs，a black ball stamped with scarlet owls．The cold Duke watched it roll across the floor．“What impudence is this？”he cried．

Hark walked to the stairs and listened，and turned and said，“There's someone up there．”

“It's the children！”croaked the Duke．

“The children are dead，”said Hark，“and the sound I heard was made by living feet．”

“How much time is left them？”cried the Duke．

“Half an hour，I think，”said Hark．

“I'll have their guggles on my sword for playing games with me！”The Duke started up the stairs and stopped．“They're up there，all of them．Call out the guards，”he barked．

“The guards are guarding the clocks，”said Hark．“You wanted it that way．There are eleven guards，and each one guards a clock．You and I are guarding these．”He pointed at the two clocks on the walls．“You wanted it that way．”

“Call out the guards，”the Duke repeated，and his agent called the guards．They trooped into the room like engines．The Duke limped up the stairs，his drawn sword shining．“Follow me！”he cried．“Another game's afoot！ I'll slay the Golux and the Prince，and marry Saralinda！”He led the way．The guards ramped up the stairs like engines．Hark smiled，and chewed again，and followed．

The black oak room was silent for a space of seven seconds．Then a secret door swung open in a wall．The Golux slipped into the room．The Princess followed．His hands were raw and red from climbing vines to Saralinda's chamber．“How could you find the castle in the dark without my rose？”she asked．“He would not let me burn a torch．”

“You lighted up your window like a star，and we could see the castle from afar，”the Golux said．“Our time is marked in minutes．Start the clocks！”

“I cannot start the clocks，”the Princess said．

They heard the sound of fighting far above．“He faces thirteen men，”she cried，“and that is hard．”

“We face thirteen clocks，”the Golux said，“and that is harder．Start the clocks！”

“How can I start the clocks？”the Princess wailed．

“Your hand is warmer than the snow is cold，”the Golux said．“Touch the first clock with your hand．”The Princess touched it．Nothing happened．“Again．”Sara linda held her hand against the clock and nothing happened．

“We are ruined，”said the Golux simply，and Saralinda's heart stood still．

She cried，“Use magic！”

“I have no magic to depend on，”groaned the Golux．“Try the other clock．”

The Princess tried the other clock and nothing happened．“Use logic，then！”she cried．In the secret walls they heard the Iron Guard pounding after Zorn，and coming close．

“Now let me see，”the Golux said．“if you can touch the clocks and never start them，then you can start the clocks and never touch them．That's logic，as I know and use it．Hold your hand this far away．Now that far．Closer！ Now a little farther back．A little farther．There！ I think you have it！ Do not move！”

The clogged and rigid works of the clock began to whir．They heard a tick and then a ticking．The Princess Saralinda fled from room to room，like wind in clover，and held her hand the proper distance from the clocks．Something like a vulture spread its wings and left the castle．“That was Then，”the Golux said．

“It's Now！”cried Saralinda．

A morning glory that had never opened，opened in the courtyard．A cock that never crowed，began to crow．The light of morning stained the windows，and in the walls the cold Duke moaned，“I hear the sound of time．And yet I slew it，and wiped my bloody sword upon its beard．”He thought that Zorn of Zorna had escaped the guards．His sword kept whining in the blackness，and once he slashed his own left knee—he thought it was the Golux．“Come out，you crooning knave！”he cried．“Stand forward，Zorn of Zorna！”

“He's not here，”said the spy．

They heard the savage clash of swords．“They've got him！”squealed the Duke．“Eleven men to one！”

“You may have heard of Galahad，”said Hark，“whose strength was as the strength of ten．”

“That leaves one man to get him，”cried the Duke．“I count on Krang，the strongest guard I have，the finest fencer in the world，save one．An unknown prince in armor vanquished him a year ago，somewhere on an island．No one else can do it．”

“The unknown prince，”said Hark，“was Zorn of Zorna．”

“I'll slay him then myself！”The Duke's voice rose and echoed down the dark and secret stairs．“I slew time with the bloody hand that grips your arm，and time is greater far than Zorn of Zorna！”

Hark began to chew again．“No mortal man can murder time，”he said，“and even if he could，there's something else：a clockwork in a maiden's heart，that strikes the hours of youth and love，and knows the southward swan from winter snow，and summer afternoons from tulip time．”

“You sicken me with your chocolate chatter，”snarled the Duke．“Your tongue is made of candy．I'll slay this ragged prince，if Krang has missed him．If there were light，I'd show you on my sleeves the old brown stains of seconds，where they bled and died．I slew time in these gloomy halls，and wiped my bloody blade—”

“Ah，shut up，”said Hark．“You are the most aggressive villain in the world．I always meant to tell you that．I said it and I'm glad．”

“Silence，”roared the Duke．“Where are we？”They stumbled down the secret stairs．

“This is the hidden door，”said Hark，“that leads into the oak room．”

“Open，”roared the Duke，his sword gripped in his hand．Hark groped and found the secret knob．





Ⅷ


The black oak room was bright with flaming torches，but brighter with the light of Saralinda．The cold eye of the Duke was dazzled by the gleaming of a thousand jewels that sparkled on the table．His ears were filled with chiming as the clocks began to strike．

“One！”said Hark．

“Two！”cried Zorn of Zorna．

“Three！”the Duke's voice almost whispered．

“Four！”sighed Saralinda．

“Five！”the Golux crowed，and pointed at the table．“The task is done，the terms are met，”he said．

The Duke's cold eye slowly moved around the room．“Where are my guards？”he croaked，“and where is Krang，the greatest of them all？”

“I lured them to the tower，”said Zorn，“and locked them in．The one that's tied in knots is Krang．”

The Duke glared at the jewels on the table．“They're false！”he said．“They must be colored pebbles！”He picked one up，and saw that it was real，and put it down again．

“The task is done，”said Hark，“the terms are met．”

“Not until I count them，”said the Duke．“If there be only one that isn't here，I wed the Princess Saralinda on the morrow．”The figures in the room were still and he could hear their breathing．

“What a gruesome way to treat one's niece，”the Golux cried．

“She's not my niece，”the lame man sneered．“I stole her from a king．”He showed his lower teeth．“We all have flaws，”he said，and mine is being wicked．”He sat down at the table and began to count the gems．

“Who is my father then？”the Princess cried．

The spy's black eyebrows rose．“I thought the Golux told you，but then，of course，he never could remember things．”

“Especially，”the Golux said，“the names of kings．”

“Your father，”said the spy，“is good King Gwain of Yarrow．”

“I knew that once，”the Golux said，“but I forgot it．”He turned to Saralinda．“Then the gift your father gave to Hagga has operated in the end to make you happy．”

The Duke looked up and bared his teeth．“The tale is much too tidy for my taste，”he snarled．“I hate it．”He went on counting．

“It's neat，”said Hark，“and，to my taste，refreshing．He removed his mask．His eyes were bright and jolly．“If I may introduce myself，”he said，“I am a servant of the King，the good King Gwain of Yarrow．”

“That，”the Golux said，“I didn't know．You could have saved the Princess many years ago．”

The servant of the King looked sad，and said，“This part I always hate to tell，but I was under a witch's spell．”

“I weary of witches，”the Golux said，“with due respect to Mother．”

The Duke's smile showed his upper teeth．“I cannot even trust the spies I see，”he muttered．His eye moved glassily around and saw the Golux．“You mere Device！”he gnarled．“You platitude！ You Golux ex machina！”

“Quiet，please，”the Golux said，“you gleaming thief．”

“Nine hundred ninety-eight，”The Duke was counting．“Nine hundred ninety-nine．”He had counted all the jewels，and put them in a sack．There was none left on the table．He gave them all a look of horrid glee．“The Princess，”said the Duke，“belongs to me．”

A deathly silence filled the room．The Golux turned a little pale and his hand began to shake．He remembered something in the dark，coming down from Hagga's hill，that struck against his ankle，a sapphire or a ruby that had fallen from the sack．“One thousand，”groaned the Duke，in a tone of vast surprise．A diamond had fallen from his glove，the left one，and no one but the Golux saw it fall．The Duke stood up and sneered．“What are you waiting for？”he shrieked．“Depart！ If you be gone forever，it will not be long enough！ If you return no more，then it will be too soon！”He slowly turned to Zorn．“What kind of knots？”he snarled．

“Turk's head，”the young Prince said．“I learned them from my sister．”

“Begone！”the cold Duke screamed again，and bathed his hands in rubies．“My jewels，”he croaked，“will last forever．”The Golux，who had never tittered，tittered．The great doors of the oak room opened，and they left the cold Duke standing there，up to his wrists in diamonds．

“Yarrow，”said the Prince，“is halfway on our journey．”They stood outside the castle．

“You'll need these，”said the Golux．He held the reins of two white horses．“Your ship lies in the harbor．It sails within the hour．”

“It sails at midnight，”Hark corrected him．

“I can't remember everything，”the Golux said．“My father's clocks were always slow．He also lacked the power of concentration．”

Zorn helped the Princess to her saddle．She gazed a last time at the castle．“A fair wind stands for Yarrow，”said the Prince．

The Golux gazed a last time at the Princess．“Keep warm，”he said．“Ride close together．Remember laughter．You'll need it even in the blessed isles of Ever After．”

“There are no horses in the stables，”mused the Prince．“Whence came these white ones？”

“The Golux has a lot of friends，”said Hark．“I guess they give him horses when he needs them．But on the other hand，he may have made them up．He makes things up，you know．”

“I know he does，”sighed Zorn of Zorna．“You sail for Yarrow with us？”

“I must stay a fortnight longer，”Hark replied．“So runs my witch's spell．It will give me time to tidy up，and untie Krang as well．”

They looked around for the old Device，but he was there no longer．“Where has he gone？”cried Saralinda．

“Oh，”said Hark，“he knows a lot of places．”

“Give him，”Saralinda said，“my love，and this．”Hark took the rose．

The two white horses snorted snowy mist in the cool green glade that led down to the harbor．A fair wind stood for Yarrow and，looking far to sea，the Princess Saralinda thought she saw，as people often think they see，on clear and windless days，the distant shining shores of Ever After．Your guess is quite as good as mine （there are a lot of things that shine） but I have always thought she did，and I will always think so．





EPILOGUE


A fortnight later，the Duke was gloating over his jewels in the oak room when they suddenly turned to tears，with a little sound like sighing．The fringes of his glowing gloves were stained with Hagga's laughter．He staggered to his feet and drew his sword，and shouted “Whisper！”In the courtyard of the castle six startled geese stopped hunting snails and looked up at the oak room．“What slish is this？”exclaimed the Duke，disgusted by the pool of melted gems leering on the table．His monocle fell，and he slashed his sword at silence and at nothing．Something moved across the room，like monkeys and like shadows．The torches on the walls went out，the two clocks stopped，and the room grew colder．There was a smell of old，unopened rooms and the sound of rabbits screaming．“Come on，you blob of glup，”the cold Duke roared．“You may frighten octopi to death，you gibbous spawn of hate and thunder，but not the Duke of Coffin Castle！”He sneered．“Now that my precious gems have turned to thlup，living on，alone and cold，is not my fondest wish！ On guard，you musty sofa！”The Todal gleeped．There was a stifled shriek and silence．

When Hark came into the room，holding a lighted lantern above his head，there was no one there．The Duke's sword lay gleaming on the floor，and from the table dripped the jewels of Hagga's laughter，that never last forever，like the jewels of sorrow，but turn again to tears a fortnight after．Hark stepped on something that squutched beneath his foot and flobbed against the wall．He picked it up and held it near the lantern．It was the small black ball stamped with scarlet owls．The last spy of the Duke of Coffin Castle，alone and lonely in the gloomy room，thought he heard，from somewhere far away，the sound of someone laughing．





The Wonderful O


Ⅰ


Somewhere a ponderous tower clock slowly dropped a dozen strokes into the gloom．Storm clouds rode low along the horizon，and no moon shone．Only a melancholy chorus of frogs broke the soundlessness．Then a strange figure appeared out of the nocturnal somnolence，as unexpectedly as the blare of a bugle in a lullaby．He entered the tavern near the sea，and a blade of light flashed into the blackness and disappeared when the old oaken door closed once more．

The newcomer was a seafaring man，and the sight of him turned the taverners silent．There was a green parrot on the man's shoulder，and a tarred pigtail hung down his back．He carried no crutch，for he had two legs，and he rolled like a goose when he walked．His voice when he spoke was as deep as a gong in a tomb．

“Call me Littlejack！”he roared，and the taverners called him Littlejack．

A lean，silent man at a shadowy table in a corner，wearing a black cape and black gloves，beckoned to the newcomer，who sat down across from him．“You look like a man with a map，”whispered the man in black．

“I am a man with a map，”boomed Littlejack．“It is a map of a far and lonely island，rich with jewels，sapphires，emeralds，and rubies．I seek a man with a ship．”

“I am a man with a ship，”said the man in black．

“And a crew to man her？”“And a crew to man her．”

“Are you a man with a name？”asked Littlejack．

“I am a man named Black，”said the man named Black．They shook hands，one heavy and bare，the other thin and gloved，and reached a bargain at one o'clock：“Two-thirds of the booty for me and you，the other third will go to the crew．”

Black smiled，and when he smiled he showed his lower teeth．“Now let me see the map，”he said．And he took the map and studied it．“There are no crosses here，”said Black，“or marks．There should be crosses here and marks，indicating where the jewels lie hidden．”

“There is another map with marks and crosses，but what became of it and where it is，no man can say，”said Littlejack．

“We'll find the map，or if we don't，we'll find the jewels without it，”Black declared．He gazed at Littlejack as if the sailor were a jigsaw puzzle that had too many parts，or not enough．“You have the mien and manner of a man out of the past．Where do you come from？”

The sailor grinned．“Not，matey，from the regions which are wholly land．I'll take the map．”

“It's safe with me，”said Black．

“It's safer if we cut the thing in two，”said Littlejack．And with his cutlass he cut the map in two．And Black took half of it and Littlejack the other half．

They went aboard the ship at two o'clock．“I can't make out her name，”said Littlejack．“How is she called？”

“The Aeiu，”said Black．

“A weird，uncanny name，”the sailor said．“It sounds a little like a night bird screaming．”

“It's all the vowels except the O，”Black said．“I've had a hatred of that letter ever since the night my mother became wedged in a porthole．We couldn't pull her in and so we had to push her out．”He shuddered and his eyes turned hard．“What is the name of this island？”he asked，shaking off the thought of O．

“Ooroo，”said Littlejack，and once more the other shuddered．

“I hate the name，”he said at last．“It sounds like the eyes of a couple of ghosts leaning against an R．I speak O-words myself，so I can spit them out．”Something screamed．“A night bird，”whispered Black．“The sailors say it's my mother．Let's go below．I've got a cabin full of rum．”





Ⅱ


When the dawn came up the Aeiu，whose sails were black as raven wings，could no longer be seen from shore，even by the sharpest eye and strongest glass．The weather was fair and the voyage was long．Then early one morning the ship came into the only port of the far and lonely island，and Black and Littlejack went ashore，the former softly，and the latter swaggering，followed by their surly and sinewy crew．

“We have come for your jewels，”Black told a spokesman of the quiet people，“with cutlasses and pistols．”

“With axes and spades and cudgels，”said Littlejack．

“We have no jewels，”said the spokesman，“except the blue of the water，and the pink of our maidens’ cheeks and lips，and the green of our fields．”

“We have come for your jewels，”repeated Black．

“We have only moonstones and opals，and other ordinary stones，”the spokesman said．

“Ordinary stones，ordinary stones！”squawked the green parrot．

“There is a map，”said Black，“a secret map，with marks and crosses，indicating where the jewels lie hidden．”

“I know of no such map，”the spokesman said．

Black grinned and showed his lower teeth again．“Take the town apart，”he cried，and the crew began taking the town apart，with axes and spades and cudgels，smashing the locks off doors，prying the lids from boxes，breaking into closets and cupboards，but all they found was moonstones and opals and other ordinary stones，lockets and lovenotes，options，contracts，mortgages，records，reports，and other documents，but neither precious stones nor any map．

“Dig in the woods，”commanded Black．

“Dig in the meadows，”ordered Littlejack．And the crew dug in the woods and in the meadows，but all they found was owls in oaks，moss and moles，toads and toadstools，roots and rocks．

“Drain the brooks，”snarled Black．

“Drain the pools，”roared Littlejack．And the crew drained the brooks and the pools，but all they found was trout and tortoises，frogs and worms，and an owl that had drowned in a pool．

“Owls in oaks，owls in pools！”squawked the parrot．

The crew then turned to towers and fountains with their axes and cudgels，but all they got for their sweat and pains was the stones that towers are built of，and the sparkle of fountain water．

That night Black and Littlejack sat at a table in a tavern，drinking rum from tankards．“There must be sapphires，”whispered Black．

“And emeralds and rubies，”grumbled Littlejack．

“Opals and moonstones，”squawked the parrot．“Lovenotes，lockets，options．Owls in oaks，moss and moles，and mortgages．”

“Stop his squawking，”Black exclaimed，“or else I'll squck his thrug till all he can whupple is geep．”

“All he can whupple is geep，all he can whupple is geep，”squawked the parrot．

“Still，I'm glad he named the things we found，”said Black，after a moment．“Everything we find has an O in its name，and everywhere we look has an O in its name，and everything we open—closets，cupboards，woods，meadows．”

“Floors and roofs，”added Littlejack，“and brooks and pools．”

Black stared into his tankard，while the tavern clock ticked sixty times．“I hate things with an O in their names，”cried Black．“That goes for clocks and parrots．”He threw his tankard at the clock and broke it open，but there was nothing inside but works，no rubies，no emeralds，and no sapphires，and no map．

“The parrot's name's Magraw，”said Littlejack．“There ain't no O in that．”

“Squck his thrug，”squawked the parrot．“Squck his thrug．”

“And there ain't no O in that，”said Littlejack．

Black stood up and smote the table with his fist．“I'll get rid of O，in upper case and lower，”cried the man in black．“I'll issue an edict．All words in books or signs with an O in them shall have the O erased or painted out．We'll print new books and paint new signs without an O in them．”

And so the locksmith became a lcksmith，and the bootmaker a btmaker，and people whispered like conspirators when they said the names．Love's Labor's Lost and Mother Goose flattened out like a pricked balloon．Books were bks and Robinhood was Rbinhd．Little Goody Two Shoes lost her O's and so did Goldilocks，and the former became a whisper，and the latter sounded like a key jiggled in a lck．It was impossible to read “cockadoodledoo”aloud，and parents gave up reading to their children，and some gave up reading altogether，and the search for the precious jewels went on．

The afternoon after the night at the tavern，while O's were being taken out of books and out of signs，so that the cw jumped over the mn，and the dish ran away with the spn，and the clockshop became a clckshp，the toymaker a tymaker，Black issued new searching orders．“Look in violins and cellos，”he commanded．

“Look in trombones，horns，and oboes，”thundered Littlejack．And the crew looked in violins and cellos，trombones，horns，and oboes，piccolos and banjos，finding nothing，for nothing came out of them except music．

That night in the tavern，after his thirteenth pint of rum，Black began to sing a ditty in a voice that had the timbre of a buzzard's：

“I won't go down the horrible street

To see the horrible people．

I'll gladly climb the terrible stair

That leads to the terrible steeple

And the terrible bats，and the terrible rats，

And the cats in the terrible steeple．

But I won't go down the horrible street

To see the horrible people．”

As he sang，the taverners stared at him and then they left their drinks unfinished，paid for them，and slunk away into the night．

“Methinks the people have a loathing for your voice and for your song，”said Littlejack．

“I'll take away from them，”said Black，“everything that plays and has an O．”

And so the following morning the crew went from house to house，seizing violins and cellos，trombones，horns and oboes，pianos，harpsichords，and clavichords，accordions and melodeons，bassoons and saxophones，and all the other instruments with O's，up to and including the woodwinds．A man and his wife who loved to play duets on mandolin and glockenspiel drifted apart．Children，forbidden the use of combs，could no longer play tunes on combs with tissue paper．The crew spent the afternoon breaking up an old calliope they had found rusting in a field，and taking apart a carillon．

“All they have is fifes and drums and cymbals，”gloated Black．

“And zithers and guitars，”said Littlejack．“And dulcimers and spinets，and bugles，harps and trumpets．”

“Much good they'll get from these，”said Black，“or any others．I haven't finished with the O’ in music，in harmony and melody，that is，and the compositions．They'll have no score，and what is more，no orchestra，or podium，or baton，and no conductor．They can't play symphonies，or rhapsodies，sonatas or concerti．I'll take away their oratorios and choirs and choruses，and all their soloists，their baritones and tenors and sopranos，their altos and contraltos and accompanists．All they'll have is the funeral march，the chant and anthem，and the dirge，and certain snatches．”

“They will still have serenades，”said Littlejack．

Black made an evil and impatient gesture．“You can't serenade a lady on a balcony，”he said，“if there isn't any balcony．Let them hum their hymns and lisp their litanies．”Black's eyes began to glow as he named O-names that would have to go：“Scherzo，largo，and crescendo，allegro and diminuendo．Let the lyric writers have their Night in June．Much good it'll do ’em without the moon．”He crushed an imaginary moon in his hand．“At least the people cannot dance the polka，or the schottische，or gavotte．I wish they mourned their loss，here on R，but they do not．”

“R？”asked Littlejack．

“I've taken the O's out of Ooroo，”Black explained．“Isles with O's in their names are few，and invariably unlucky，such as the Isle of Lyonese，which sank into the sea．I've made a list of isles still standing，none of which has a trace of O．It must mean something．”He pulled a parchment from his pocket and read the names of O-less isles aloud：“Iceland，Greenland，England，Wales，and Ireland；Jersey；Guernsey，Man and Wight；Capri，Crete，and Cyprus；Elba，Malta，and St．Helena；Madagascar，Zanzibar，Sardinia—”

“St．Helena and Elba，”said Littlejack，“were not too lucky for Napoleon．”

“Napoleon Bonaparte，”said Black，“was born on Corsica．His bad luck started there．”And then he resumed the reading of his list：“Bali and the Baleares，the Philippines and Celebes，the Fijis and the Hebrides，Cuba and Bermuda，the East Indies and West Indies，the Lesser and the Greater Antilles，Martinique and Trinidad，Easter and Jamaica，the Virgins and Canaries，Sicily and Haiti and Hawaii．And add a T to Haiti for Tahiti．”His voice gave out before the list was finished．

Littlejack closed one eye and said，“You left out one．A friend of mine named Gunn lived there，if you could call it living．”

“Its name，”breathed Black，“is Treasure．”





Ⅲ


That night the people of the town and those who lived in the country met secretly in the woods．They had been called together by a poet named Andreus，who read aloud，or tried to read，a poem he had just had printed at the printer's．It was called “The Mn Belngs T Lvers，”but the poetry had died in it with the death of its O's．“Soon Black and Littlejack，”said Andreus，“will no longer let us live in houses，for houses have an O．”

“Or cottage，”said the blacksmith，“for cottage has an O，and so does bungalow．”

“We'll have to live in huts，”the baker said，“or shacks，or sheds，or shanties，or in cabins．”

“Cabins without logs，”said Andreus．“We shall have mantels but no clocks，shelves without crocks，keys without locks，walls without doors，rugs without floors，frames without windows，chimneys with no roofs to put them on，knives without a fork or spoon，beds without pillows．There will be no wood for our fires，no oil for our lamps，and no hobs for our kettles．”

“They will take my dough，”moaned the baker．

“They will take my gold，”moaned the goldsmith．

“And my forge，”sighed the blacksmith．

“And my cloth，”wept the tailor．

“And my chocolate，”muttered the candymaker．

At this a man named Hyde arose and spoke．“Chocolate is bad for stomach，”he said．“We shall still have wintergreen and peppermint．Hail to Black and Littlejack，who will liberate us all from licorice and horehound！”

“Hyde is a lawyer，”Andreus pointed out，“and he will still have his fees and fines．”

“And his quills and ink，”said the baker．

“And his paper and parchment，”said the goldsmith．

“And his chair and desk，”said the blacksmith．

“And his signs and seals，”said the tailor．

“And his briefs and liens，”said the candymaker．

But the lawyer waved them all aside．“We shall all have an equal lack of opportunity，”he said smoothly．“We shall all have the same amount of nothing．There must be precious jewels，or Black and Littlejack would not have come so far to search for them．I suggest we look in nooks and corners and in pigeonholes ourselves．”Some of the men agreed with Hyde，but most of them took the poet's side．

“We must think of a way to save our homes，”the poet said．And they sat on the ground until the moon went down，trying to think of a way．And even as they thought，Black and Littlejack and their men were busily breaking open dolls，and yellow croquet balls，and coconuts，but all they found was what is always found in dolls，and yellow croquet balls，and coconuts．

The next morning Andreus was walking with his poodle in a street whose cobblestones had been torn up in the search for jewels when he encountered Black and Littlejack．

“You are both pets now，”sneered Littlejack，“for the O has gone out of poet，and out of trochee and strophe and spondee，and ode and sonnet and rondeau．”

The poodle growled．

“I hate poodles，”snarled Black，“for poodles have a double O．”

“My pet is French，”said Andreus．“He is not only a chien，which is French for dog，but a caniche，which is French for poodle．”

“Chien caniche，”squawked the parrot．“Chien caniche．”

“Then I will get rid of the other domestic creatures with an O，”cried Black，and he issued an edict to this effect．

There was great consternation on the island now，for people could have pigs，but no hogs or pork or bacon；sheep，but no mutton or wool；calves，but no cows．Geese were safe as long as one of them did not stray from the rest and become a goose，and if one of a family of mice wandered from the nest，he became a mouse and lost his impunity．Children lost their ponies，and farmers their colts and horses and goats and their donkeys and their oxen．

Test cases were constantly brought to court—or curt，as it was called．“Somebody will have to clarify the law for everybody，or nobody will know where anybody stands，”the people said．So Black appointed Hyde lawyer，judge，and chief clarifier．“The more chaotic the clarification，”said Black，“the better．Remember how I hate that letter．”

This was right up Hyde's dark and devious alley．Chaotic is now chatic，”he said，“a cross between chaos and static．”He decided that farmers could keep their cows if they kept them in herds，for cows in herds are kine or cattle．And so the people had milk and cheese and butter．He decided in favor of hens and eggs，if hens were segregated．“Keep them out of flocks，”he said，“for flocks are not only flocks，but also poultry．”

“We have no corn or potatoes，or cauliflower or tomatoes，”a housewife said one day．

“In a vegetable garden，”said Hyde，“the things that grow are ninety-five per cent without an O．I could name your twenty such，”he added cockily，“and then you'd scream in unison for broccoli．Almost all the fruits are yours to eat，from the apple to the tangerine，with a good two dozen in between．I'll stick to those that start with P to show you what I mean：the pear，the peach，the plum，the prune，the plantain and pineapple，the pawpaw and papaya．But you will yearn for things you never ate，and cannot tolerate—I know you women—the pomegranate，for one，and the dull persimmon．No grapefruit，by the way．I hate its bitter juice．I have banned it，under its French name，pamplemousse．”

Another wife took the stand one day to complain of the thing she hadn't．“Cloves and cinnamon，”she said，“and marjoram and saffron．”

“You still have dill，”said Hyde，“and thyme and sage and basil，vinegar，vanilla，and sarsaparilla，salt and pepper and paprika，ginger and the spices．You can't have coffee，but there is tea；to sweeten it，there's sugar．”

A seamstress raised her hand to ask about the O's in textiles，fabrics，and in clothes．“You're denied a few，”admitted Hyde．“Corduroy and bombazine，organdy and tricotine，calico and crinoline．But you have silk and satin，velvet，lace and linen，tulle and twill and tweed，damask and denim，madras and muslin，felt and chintz and baize and leather，and twenty more for cool and warm and winter weather．”

Now the boatswain of the crew was a man named Stragg and the cockswain was a man named Strugg，and the former was allergic to roses，and the latter was allergic to phlox．So Black decided that even the flowers with an O in their names were against him，and he ordered his crew to get rid of roses and phlox in the gardens of the island，and oleanders and moonflowers and morning-glories，and cosmos and coxcomb and columbine，and all the rest with O's．

“But my livelihood is violets and hollyhocks and marigold，”a gardener complained．

“Lilies are nice for livelihood，”said Hyde，“and more alliterative．There are also lilacs and the like．I crossbred certain things myself，with more success than failure．Forget-me-not，when crossed with madwort，lose their O's．I get a hybrid which I call regret-me-evers．Love-in-a-mist，when crossed with bleeding hearts，results in sweethearts' quarrels．”

“It's blasphemy or heresy，”the women cried，“or something！”

“You haven't heard the half of it，”said Hyde．“Black-eyed susans，crossed with ragged sailors，give me ragged susans．Jack-in-the-pulpit，crossed with devil's paintbrush，should give me devil-in-the-pulpit．And think of the fine satanic chimes that will emerge from hellebore crossed with Canterbury bells．”At this the women rose in anger and dismay and left the curt without a curtsy．

“Why not get rid of all the flowers？”demanded Black one day．“After all，there is an O in flowers．”

“I thought of that，”said Hyde，“but we must spare collective nouns，like food，and goods，and crops，and tools，and，I should think，the lesser schools．I have taken the carpenter's gouge and boards．It still leaves him much too much，but that's the way it goes，with and without O's．He has his saw and ax and hatchet，his hammer and his chisel，his brace and bit，and plane and level，also nails and tacks and brads and screws and staples．But all he can build is bric-a-brac and knickknack，gewgaw，kickshaw，and gimcrack．No coop or goathouse，no stoop or boathouse．”

“I would that I could banish body；then I'd get rid of everybody．”Black's eyes gleamed like rubies．“No more anatomy，and no morphology，physiognomy，or physiology，or people，or even persons．I think about it often in the night．Body is blood and bones and other O's，organs，torso，abdomen，and toes．”

Hyde curled his upper lip．“I'll build you a better man，”he said，“of firmer flesh and all complete，from hairy head to metatarsal feet，using A's and I's and U's and E's，with muscular arms and flexible knees；eyes and ears and lids and lips，neck and chest and breast and hips；liver，heart and lungs and chin，nerves and ligaments and skin；kidneys，pancreas and flanks，ankles，calves and shin and shanks；legs and lashes，ribs and spleen—”Black had turned a little green，and then Hyde held up both his hands．“Brains and veins and cells and glands—”

“Silence！”thundered Black．“I wish that more things had an O．”

Hyde sighed．“There is no O in everything，”he said．“We can't change that．”

“I will not take their vocal cords，or tongues，or throats，”said Black，“but I shall make these jewel hiders speak without the use of O in any word they say．”

And so language and the spoken word diminished and declined as the people were forced to speak without the use of O in any word．No longer could the people say Heigh-Ho，Yoohoo，or Yo ho ho，or even plain Hello．The theater in the towns was closed，for Shakespeare's lines without an O sound flat and muffled．No one could play Othello when Othello turned to Thell，and Desdemona was strangled at the start．Some sentences became so strange they sounded like a foreign tongue．“Dius gre gling minus gress”meant “Odious ogre ogling ominous ogress，”but only scholars knew it．Spoken words became a hissing and a mumble，or a murmur and a hum．A man named Otto Ott，when asked his name，could only stutter．Ophelia Oliver repeated hers，and vanished from the haunts of men．

“We can't tell shot from shoot，or hot from hoot，”the blacksmith said，in secret meeting with his fellows．

“We can't tell rot from root，or owed from wed，”the baker said．

“It's even worse than that，”said Andreus，“for oft becomes the same as foot，and odd the same as dodo．Something must be done at once，or we shall never know what we are saying．”And he was right．Some people said that moles were mulls，while others called them emmels．The author of a book called Flamingo Stories read Flaming Stries aloud to his wife，and gave up writing．

“I still hear laughter，”Black complained to Hyde one day．“After all I've done to them I still hear laughter．”

“There is no O in laughter，”Hyde reminded him，“or in smile，or grin，or giggle．There is，of course，an O in chortle，but none in chuckle or in snicker．”

“Don't play games with me！”snarled Black．“Games，”he repeated，chewing the word as if it were candy．“Take their Yo-yos and diavolos and dominoes；throw their quoits and shuttlecocks away，and everything pertaining to croquet；shuffleboard and crochinole must go，Post Office，Pillow，and ticktacktoe．Ping-pong—”

Hyde raised his hand in quick dissent．“Table tennis，”he said，“is played with O-less paddles，balls and net，upon an O-less table．”

Black went on naming the names of what were now illegal games．“Let them play tiddlywinks，”said Black，“and mumblety-peg．”

Hyde recruited a dozen men，and soon a dozen others were helping them to keep the people from playing certain games at night in cellars—leapfrog，hopscotch，and Pussy Wants a Corner．

“We live in peril and in danger，”Andreus told the people，“and in a little time may have left few things that we can say．Already there is little we can play．I have a piece that I shall read．It indicates the quandary we're in．”And then he read it：

“They are swing chas．What is slid？ What is left that's slace？ We are begne and webegne．Life is bring and brish．Even schling is flish．Animals in the z are less lacnic than we．Vices are filled with paths and scial intercourse is baths．Let us gird up ur lins like lins and rt the hrrr and ust the afs．”

“What nannibickering is this？”cried the blacksmith．“What is this gibberish？”

“English，”said Andreus，“without its O's．”And he read the piece again with all its O's and double O's．Many had figured webegne was woebegone，but none could tell that begne was obegone．

“How shall we dispel this nightmare of flishness？”demanded the baker，who could not say f for of．

“The answer must lie，”said Andreus，“in what has been written．I suggest that we all read what we have left in libraries，searching the secret，hunting the scheme and spell that may bring an end to Black and Littlejack．”

It was dark in the woods that night，and Andreus and his followers did not realize that Hyde listened to their plans，concealed behind a tree．He had been barred from bar and meetings by his colleagues and his countrymen．The next morning the outlawed lawyer went to Black and told what he had heard．

“Destroy all books that might be helpful，”commanded Black，“especially those dealing with studies and sciences that have O's in their names；geography，biography，biology，psychology，philosophy，philology，astronomy，agronomy，gastronomy；trigonometry，geometry，optometry，and all the other ologies and onomies and ometries．”

The crew set about their new task with a will，and before they were through they had torn down colleges and destroyed many a book and tome and volume，and globe and blackboard and pointer，and banished professors，assistant professors，scholars，tutors，and instructors．There was no one left to translate English into English．Babies often made as much sense as their fathers．





Ⅳ


There walked in beauty on the island a maiden named Andrea．In her father's library one night，searching for the secret and the spell that might confound the vandals and in the end get rid of them，she found an ancient book of magic．The next night Andrea brought the book to the secret meeting in the woods．Andreus was fearful，for women had not been permitted to take part in the meetings．The poet was afraid that women might be banished from the island because of the O in women and in woman．

“They would banish mothers，too，”said Andreus，forgetting to speak in words without an O．

“A maiden is safe as a maiden，”Andrew pointed out，“and as a lass，or girl，or damsel，as a virgin and as spinster．”

“And as a darling and a dear，”said Andreus．“But still you are a woman．”

“I could become a bride and wife，”said Andrea．“Bride and wife are more than woman．”

“Then you would be a matron，”said Andreus，“without the hope of tot or toddler，boy or moppet．”

“Enough of this puppybabble and pussyfret，”the wheelwright whined．“I have no spokes for my wheels，and wheels without spokes are like words without O's．”

“I have no tallow for my candles，”complained the candlemaker，“and candles without tallow are not candles．”

“Be not afraid to speak with O's，”said Andrea at last．“We cannot live or speak without hope，and hope without its O is nothing，and even nothing is less than nothing when it is nthing．Hope contains the longest O of all．We mustn't lose it．”Thereupon she gave Andreus the book she had found in her father's library．

“It is called The Enchanted Castle，”said Andreus．

“I know the book，”quavered an old man with a white beard，“and I can tell you what it says，and spare you the time and trouble of reading a book aloud that has no O's in any word．”

“Then tell us what it says，”cried Andreus，“for it is full of footnotes which are now called ftntes．”

The old man cleared his throat and spoke．“Listen，my children，and you shall hear of a magical castle which will appear one month from tonight in this very year．”And he told the tale of the enchanted castle，while the others listened in silence．“There was a king upon this island once，a thousand years ago，but he was driven from his castle by such a crew of bashlocks and shatterclocks as plagues us now．They took the castle apart and down，stone by stone，searching for precious jewels or a map which were not there，or，if they were，could not be found．The king was banished from the island，but as he left he put a wondrous spell upon the ground where once the castle stood．”The old man stopped to scratch his head．

“How runs this spell？”demanded Andreus．

“Perhaps the maiden here remembers．My memory is no longer what it was，”the old man said．

“Every hundred years the castle shall appear again，”Andreus said，“in semblance and in seeming，an enchanted castle，such as children see when they are dreaming．”

“And who may enter there？”asked Andreus．“And why and wherefore？”

Andrea raised her hands and let them fall．“The last page of the book is lost，”she said．

“The last page of the book contained a map，”the old man murmured．“My memory isn't what it was，but I remember that．”He stood awhile in silence，then went on．“Whoever finds the map will find a jewel in everything he opens．My memory isn't what it was，but I remember that．”

“Where is this map？”asked Andreus．“Can you remember that？”

The old man thought and thought before he spoke．“It's on a wall，I seem to recall，an old wall in the castle．Whoever finds it will find a certain jewel without which men are lost．”

“Then we shall be first upon the scene when the castle reappears，”cried Andreus．

The old man shook his head in gloom．“Only evil men may enter there，”he said．“So runs the royal spell．I know not why，and if I ever knew，I have forgotten．”

“Then we are lost，”said Andreus．

“We can't be lost when lost has lost its O，”the old man said．“Or can we？”

Then others turned away lest they reveal the look of doom upon their faces．The old man spoke again．“I seem to hear a strange new bell，an old familiar bell，a bell I never heard before，a bell that I remember．”

The others turned to him and stared．And in the gloom Andrea whispered，“A bell of triumph，or a knell？”

“Time，”the old man sighed，“will tell．”





Ⅴ


The vandals spent the next day breaking into cupolas and cracking open cornices and cornerstones，smashing gargoyles into bits，and razing marble columns，Ionic，Doric，Gothic，and Corinthian，and everything baroque or rococo．In one cool，cloistered corridor Black himself smashed with an ax marble busts of Homer and Horace and Plato，Ovid and Omar and Cato，Diogenes and Damocles，Socrates and Hippocrates，and Demosthenes and Aristophanes．Not a single sparkle sparkled in the rubble．

“Why don't we open tombs？”Littlejack inquired one day．“Jewels are often hid in tombs．”

“Tombs are in cemeteries，”Black replied．“I have come to hold a great respect for words that have no O．That is why we shall invade no shrine，or church，or chapel．”

“Perhaps you have a certain dread of ghosts and ghouls，”said Littlejack．“They howl in O，you know，and so do goblins and hobgoblins．But spooks and phantoms have an O we cannot touch．”

“I hate all O's I cannot touch，”Black muttered with a shudder．

“The alphabet has taken over，”Littlejack complained．“What was the letter of the law is now the law of the letter．”

“Nonetheless，we search no place without an O，”said Black．“That is why I've left untouched the jungle and the desert and the swamp，the wilderness and wasteland．Besides，they're full of animals with A and E and I and U in all their names：the camel and the elephant，the aardvark and the platypus，the yak，the zebra，and the gnu，the tiger and the jaguar，the panther and the puma and the lynx．I have a certain liking now for creatures of this kind．”

“I have a certain fear of animals with O，”said Littlejack．“I know not why．”

“I happen to know there are no animals with O，”said Black．“I'll tell you why．There is a man named Filch among the crew．”

“A sticky-fingered lad，”said Littlejack．

“Whose sticky fingers found an ancient document somewhere among the ruins we have made，”said Black．

“How goes this document？”asked Littlejack．

Black showed his lower teeth．“It tells of how a king in olden times，whose niece was bitten by a crocodile，banished all the larger animals with O from desert，swamp，and jungle—the crocodile，the lion，and the boar，the python and the cobra and the boa，the gorilla and the gibbon and the wolf．Orangutans and baboons disappeared．The porcupine，the mongoose，and the sloth，the dingo and the leopard and the potto were driven from their tree，or cave，or grotto．”

“The rhinoceros and the hippopotamus？”asked Littlejack．

“Gone with the otter and the kangaroo，”said Black．“There are no creatures left with O here on this island，except a few so small they cannot plague us．”And once again that night he said，seated in the tavern，“There are no animals with O to plague us．”

A barmaid heard his words，and when her work was done she joined the others at their secret meeting in the woods and told them all what Black had said．And at this moment Hyde appeared among them，as if from nowhere．“Your furred and finned and feathered friends with O are either gone，or quite extinct，or never were！”he cried．“The dinosaur and the brontosaurus，the mammoth and the behemoth，old ichthyosaurus and the pterodactyl，the dodo and the mastodon．”He turned to Andreus and said sarcastically，“The only other animals with O are mythical．Why don't you call on them for help？”

“What animals are these that never were？”the old man asked．“My memory isn't what it was，you know．I find it very hard to think of things that haven't been．”

“The unicorn，the dragon，and the Minotaur，”said Hyde，“demons out of legend and of lore—the griffon and the cockatrice，the Phoenix and the Gorgon and the roc，the ogo-pogo and the monster in the Loch．And if these ten don't make a quorum，why，call upon the cockalorum．”The moon had gone behind a cloud and the people felt cold and fearful，as if they had lost，somehow，their only allies．“The animals with A and E and I and U are on the side of Black and Littlejack，”said Hyde，“and that is all there are．Unless，of course，you count the creatures with an O one finds in fairy tales and fantasies—the tove，the mome rath，and the borogove，the whiffenpoof and wogglebug and Dong，the Pod，the Todal，and the gorm．”

“I never heard of gorms，”the old man said，“or Todals．”

“That's because they never were，”said Hyde，“except in books，where they are not your friend but foe，since each of them has lost its O．”He left the group and disappeared among the trees，and they could hear his mocking laughter as he went．

Andrea had fallen silent，but now she spoke as if reciting something：“There are four words with O．you mustn't lose them．Find out what they are and learn to use them．”

“Hope is one，”said Andreus．

“And love，”said Andrea．

“And valor，I should think，”the old man said．And then they tried to find the fourth，naming courage，thought，and reason，devotion，work，and worship．

“None of these is right，”said Andrea．“I'll know it when I hear it．”And so，until the setting of the moon，they tried out words with O—imagination and religion，dedication and decision，honor，progeny，and vision．“None of these is the word，”said Andrea．“I'll know it when I hear it．”

“I hope，”the old man said，“we think of it in time．Perhaps the word is wisdom．”

“An austere word，”Andrea said，“but surely not the greatest．”And they spent the rest of the night searching for the greatest，trying youth and joy and jubilation，victory and exaltation，languor，comfort，relaxation，money，fortune，non-taxation，motherhood and domesticity，and many anotherhood and icity．But Andrea shook her lovely head at every word the people said，rejecting soul and contemplation，dismissing courtship and elation，and many anothership and ation．

“I miss the O，”the old man said，“in faith and truth and beauty．The O belongs，alas，to lost and gone，forsaken and forgotten．”The others felt forlorn at this，but still the search continued，in all the hopes and dreams of men，from action to euphoria．The old man stroked his beard and said，“Sic transit verbi gloria．”

There still were those who spoke with O's，and one of these was a boatwright，a man of force and gusto．“You are still my spouse and not my spuse，”he told his fearful wife，“and this is my house and not my huse，and I make boats，not bats，and I wear coats，not cats．What，”he asked his youngest son，“did you learn today in school？”

“It's schl，”his son replied．

“Never hiss at me，”his father cried．“When I want aloes，I don't want ales，I hate such names．And cameos are cameos，not cames．Yesterday I met a man who wanted four canoes—”

“Fur canes，”his son put in．

“Silence！”he father shouted．“What did you learn today in school？”

“That mist is always mist，but what is mist isn't always mist，”his son recited．

At this his father rose up like a storm，put on his hat and cat，and stalked to where the door had been，and reached for where the knob once was．

“Where are yu ging？”whispered his anxious wife．

“Ut！”the boatwright cried，and ut he went．

“What did yu say t yur father that made him leave the huse？”the mother asked her son．

“Mist is always moist，”the boy replied in whispers，“but what is moist isn't always mist．”

And other odd occurrences occurred．A swain who praised his sweetheart's thrat，and said she sang like a chir of riles or a chrus of vires，was slapped．And so it went，and some lads lost their lasses，and most men lost their tempers，and all men lost their patience，and a few men lost their minds．

Then Black called Hyde one day in consultation．“Some of the people salute me as I pass，”he growled．“Do you know why？”

“O-lessness is now a kind of cult in certain quarters，”Hyde observed，“a messy lessness，whose meaninglessness nonetheless attracts the few，first one or two，then three or four，then more and more．People often have respect for what they cannot comprehend，since some men cannot always tell their crosses from their blessings，their laurels from their thorns．It shows up in the games they still can play．Charades are far more work than fun，and so are Blind Man's Buff and Hide-and-Seek，and Run，Sheep，Run．O-lessism may become the ism of the future，and men from far and wide，pilgrims on a pilgrimage，may lay their tributes on your grave．”

Black showed his teeth and made a restless gesture．“Taking a single letter from the alphabet，”he said，“should make life simpler．”

“I don't see why．Take the F from life and you have lie．It's adding a letter to simple that makes it simpler．Taking a letter from hoarder makes it harder．”With a small shrug and a little leer，Hyde turned on his heel and walked away．

Black watched him go and scowled．“He's much too smart，”he said aloud，“for his own good and for mine．”





Ⅵ


There were no clocks to mark the passing hours，for Black had smashed them all．It was October now，but no one knew what day，for Black had torn from all the calendars the months with O's，October and November．Little enough was left upright，unbroken，or unravaged，and the town without its towers，and the countryside without its fountains and its pools，and the woods which had lost their oaks and hemlocks seemed deserted．The robins and the orioles had gone，and even the whippoorwill no longer sang．Then came the night the old man had predicted．

Black and Littlejack were at their table in the tavern when they heard a hue and cry，and children calling．Dogs without an O，the beagles，bassets，and the spaniels，set up a mournful howling．A wondrous light filled all the sky．

“What revelry is this？”demanded Black．

“I know not what，”said Littlejack，“but I don't like it．”

“I don't like it，I don't like it，”squawked the parrot，and Black squcked his thrug till all he could whupple was geep．

“Geep，”whuppled the parrot．

Black and Littlejack strode to where the door had been，walking on earth because the floor was gone，and stared up toward the sky．An enormous castle，lighted as by the light of many moons，stood upon a hill a mile away．

“A castle！”cried Black．He rubbed his gloves together and he gloated．“The jewels！”he cried．“The emeralds，the rubies，and the sapphires！”

“Not so fast，”warned Littlejack．

“Faster！”cried Black，and he hurried through the night，stumbling on the torn-up cobbles of the streets，his shining eyes upon the shining castle．

“Not so fast，”warned Littlejack again．“I smell the smell of trickery and ruse．”

“I smell the smell of jewels，”Black exclaimed．“I smell a map．”

Their crew had gathered round them now with their axes and their spades and their cudgels，yelping like a pack of hungry hounds，and they all surged toward the castle，urged on by Stragg and Strugg．

From where they stood in the shadow of a broken column，Andreus and Andrea watched them go．“This is their wildest night，and I hope it is their last，”breathed Andreus．

“Keep saying hope，”the old man said，appearing out of nowhere，“for we shall need it．”

“There is a footnote in the book，”said Andrea，“which I forgot to mention．”

“How does it read？”asked Andreus．

“That if the men who seek their heart's desire within the castle find it not before the hour of noon tomorrow，their cause is lost．”

“It gives them two long hours and ten，and they must have a hundred men，”said Andreus．

“I could find a map in half that time and all alone，”the old man said，“if I were young．”

“The map is not their heart's desire；it is the jewels，”said Andrea．“And there is something in the book about a vast frustrating forest．”

“How goes that part？”asked Andreus．

“It was written all in O，or nearly so，and all the O's are gone，”said Andrea．“When coat is cat，and boat is bat，and goatherd looks like gathered，and booth is both，since both are bth，the reader's eye is bothered．”

“And power is pwer，and zero zer，and，worst of all，a hero's her．”The old man sighed as he said it．

“Anon is ann，and moan is man．”Andrea smiled as she said it．

“And shoe，”Andrea said，“is she．”

“Ah，woe，”the old man said，“is we．”





Ⅶ


Black and Littlejack and Stragg and Strugg and all their men scattered through the castle like a band of mad baboons，and their shouting and their clamor shook the shields upon the walls．“Find the jewels or the map！”cried Black and Littlejack．“Find the jewels or the map！”shouted Stragg and Strugg and all their men．And they used their axes and their cudgels on every lock and every door，breaking into cupboards，cracking open closets，prying off the lids of boxes，smashing clocks with spades．The hours went on and the clangor rose．Everything that had an O was opened，ransacked，and pulled apart—sofas，and couches，and ottomans，things made of onyx and ormolu，ivory and ebony，gold and chalcedony，crocks and bowls，pillows and cushions and footstools，and even flagons and goblets．The men drank wine from bottles，white and red and ros ，and then they smashed the bottles．Boards were taken up，and marble floors，but no jewels came to light，or any map，no glow or gleam or glitter，no sight of parchment．

The moon went down；the sun began to climb the heavens．The clamor and the clangor ceased．Everything that could be broken had been broken．Glass and splinters，bits and fragments lay upon the floors，or where the floors had been．Then the wild-eyed Black raised his clenched gloves toward the sky and in that moment saw the map．It hung upon a wall，the only one left standing．

“I have not seen this wall before，”cried Black．

“It was not here a moment since，”cried Littlejack．“I'd lay to that．”

They took the map down from the wall and spread it on a plank and bent above it，and in the end deciphered all its marks and crosses．

“The treasure lies five thousand feet from where this skull is grinning，”shouted Black．“We come first to a stricken oak and count off fifty paces．”

“Nor'，nor'east，”cried Littlejack．

“The jewels are ours，”Black gloated．“We're princes！”

“Kings！”bawled Littlejack．And Stragg and Strugg and all their men echoed “Kings！”But there was no echo to their echo，for all the walls were gone．They saw before them now a dark and gloomy forest，stretching on and on，and on and farther．

“Spades！”commanded Black．“And follow me！”Then each man seized his spade and followed Black and Littlejack and Stragg and Strugg into the dark and gloomy forest．

“How goes the day？”cried Black．

“It lacks two hours of noon，”said Littlejack．

“I hate the sound of noon，”said Black．“I know not why．”

“Perhaps because it has two O's，”said Stragg．

“Perhaps because the day grows hot，”said Strugg．

“And treasure should be dug up in the night，”said Littlejack．

“Silence，”thundered Black，“and follow me．The weather here is strange．I hate this weather．”

“Why is it so hard，”asked Littlejack，“to stay together？”And even as he spoke he found himself alone．He called and got no answer．

“This way，”cried Black，“and all men follow me．I feel the jewels burning in my hands．I have the map and a compass．Find the stricken oak！”His voice ended in a gurgle and a croak．And then his eyes grew wide with fear，his fingers trembled，for he stood all alone，like all the others．The going underfoot was slow and oozy，for burrowing moles had devoured the roots and softened the soil．

“There are no outlets and no openings，”cried Black．“It's soggy and it's boggy．”

A million moths hovered above his shoulders and countless chameleons changed color on gloomy growths．Glowworms glowed around and about，and Black could not make out where he was going．Then came the butterflies．“Butterflies do not have O's，”cried Black，but he was wrong．The monarchs and the morning cloaks，the clouded yellows，and all their colleagues and their fellows made up the throng．The sun went out and it seemed night again．

“What is this woeful wood？”Black whimpered，and no one answered．

“What is this woeful wood？”croaked Littlejack，lost and all alone in another part of the forest．The dark was deep as midnight all around．“Whence comes this humming and this buzzing？”wailed Littlejack．And then he saw the source of the ominous sounds：locusts and hornets and dragonflies，yellowjackets and honeybees．They came in clouds and hosts and squadrons．“Black never thought of little things，”mourned Littlejack，“when he was issuing edicts．”He groped his way slowly into an outlandish grove，but there his way was clogged by a growth of toadstools and mushrooms and monkshood and bloodroot，foxglove，wolfbane and aconite，orchids and opium poppies，and the roots of mandragora．Spanish moss drooped down and Spanish bayonets shot up．“What are these woeful worts？”muttered Littlejack，now up to his ankles and his knees in worts：bloodwort，dragonwort，goutwort，hogwort，holewort，hoodwort，lousewort，moonwort，moorwort，scorpionwort，throatwort，toothwort，and woundwort．

“What woeful wood is this？”squealed Hyde，lost and all alone in another part of the forest．Odd lights blinded him with their glow and glare and glitter：St．Elmo's fire and foxfire，will-o'-the-wisp and phosphorus，and the aurora borealis．“These are the lights of night，and not of day，”moaned Hyde，“and yet I thought I saw the dawn a few hours since．”He stared up at the sky，seeking the sun，and the cold O of Canopus stared down at him．The Southern Cross seemed to point its stars at him like fingers，comets and meteors flared like flaming arrows，and Virgo blazed，Capricorn，and Scorpio，the Major Dogstar and the Minor，and so many others，Hyde lost count of stars and constellations．

Then the lights went out and darkness reigned once more，and in the darkness came a show of fireworks：rockets dropping colorful balloons，Roman candles，flowerpots，and golden showers，and silver fountains．And now there were owls and crows，loons and woodcocks，herons and flamingos，cormorants and condors，and one albatross with an arrow from a crossbow in its feathers，swooping and stooping about his head like bombers．He stumbled on，plagued by a scourge of mosquitoes，microbes，and microorganisms，through sycamore and hemlock，cottonwood and hickory，black and honey locust，oak and giant redwood，and underfoot，frogs and toads in woad hindered and hampered and harassed his going．“Incompetent，irrelevant，and immaterial，”he murmured，and all the other lawyer talk that lawyers talk in triplicate．Suddenly a swoop of swans attacked him．“Objection！”Hyde implored．“Swans have no O's．”Then he recalled the cob and cos，or male and female swan．“Confusion on creatures without an O that have an O in their alias，”shouted Hyde，and even as he spoke a lynx was snarling at his feet．“The bobcat，”whimpered Hyde．A puma showed its gleaming fangs．“The mountain lion，”quavered Hyde．“But here's a camel！ I can ride！”

“I am the dromedary，”the camel said，or seemed to say，and then it closed one eye，and opened it，and went away．

“Imponderable，impalpable，and improbable，”shouted Hyde．A nightingale beat its wings before his eyes．“Je suis le rossignol，”it sang．

“Impossible，”raved Hyde，“irreverent and unfair．”

Three bears transpired，in legal lingo，which means they happened，took place，and occurred．“Les ours，in French！”Hyde screamed．“Moreover，furthermore，and too：the cinnamon，the polar，and the brown．”He took four wobbly hops and toppled and fell down．





Ⅷ


All of a sudden the way grew clearer for Black in his dark part of the forest，and the sun shone bright．The earth beneath his feet seemed firmer．The threatening trees had disappeared except for one，all that was left of a stricken oak，standing in a clearing．And then he saw the long gaunt form of Littlejack，and Stragg and Strugg，and all their men，gathered about a certain spot and pointing with their spades，bitten and stung，and ruffled and rumpled，but screaming in glee and delight．

“This is the place！”cried Littlejack．

“Dig，”croaked Black．And the men were about to dig with their spades，but their hands were stayed as they raised them by an ominous clamor and clangor，a snow of arrows and a sound of armor．Many figures of men loomed up，afoot or on horses，and they rode and ran among the crew，and the crew let drop their spades．

“These are but figures of fantasy，”cried Black．“These men have no blood in their veins．”

“Dig，”bawled Littlejack，but no man dug．They stood as if rooted in the ground and gazed at the apparitions．

“Ink runs in their veins，immortal ink，the ink of song and story．”It was the voice of Andreus．

“Ink can be destroyed，”cried Black，“and men who are made of ink．Name me their names！”

They came so swiftly from the skies Andreus couldn't name them all，streaming out of lore and legend，streaming out of song and story，each phantom flaunting like a flag his own especial glory：Lancelot and Ivanhoe，Athos，Porthos，Cyrano，Roland，Rob Roy，Romeo；Donalbane of Birnam Wood，Robinson Crusoe and Robin Hood；the moody Doones of Lorna Doone，Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone；out of near and ancient tomes，Banquo's ghost and Sherlock Holmes；Lochinvar，Lothario，Horatius，and Horatio；and there were other figures，too，darker，coming from the blue，Shakespeare's Shylock，Billy Bones，Quasimodo，Conrad's Jones，Ichabod and Captain Hook—names enough to fill a book．

“These wearers of the O，methinks，are indestructible，”wailed Littlejack．

“Books can be burned，”croaked Black．

“They have a way of rising out of ashes，”said Andreus．

“I have a woeful feeling，as if the double O of doom were sticking in my throat．”Black's voice，though choked，grew brighter．“The phantoms pass，”he cried．“Take up your spades！”But as if this were a signal or sign，the air was filled with sudden laughter，and other figures began circling above and about the vandals like laughing Indians riding ponies，led by Mother Goose astride a broom．

“Who are these spawn of nightmare or of fever？”demanded Black．

This time it was Andrea's voice that answered him：“Little Jack Horner come out of his corner，Tommy Trout and the cat he pulled out，poor Cock Robin and Bessy Brooks，Simple Simon and Tommy Snooks，Dr．Foster come home from Gloucester，Little Boy Blue and King Cole，too，and a certain old woman who lived in a shoe．”

“These are but shadows，”quavered black．“I ripped the O from heroes and from fools！”

“But not from love，”said Andrea，“or from affection，and not from memory or recollection．”

“Pick up your spades！”ordered Black，laughing so his men would laugh，but no one laughed．Then other shadows rode like thunder from the skies：the Argonauts and Myrmidons and Amazons，Adonis and Endymion，Apollo and Hyperion，and high above them，flying faster，Pollux and his brother Castor，burning like a flame in spars，lighting up the sky like stars．

Then came the great O giants：Cormoran and Blunderbore，Goliath and a hundred more，the Cyclops，hurling peaks at Norman，and even the Abominable Himalayan Snowman．

The men were prostrate now upon the ground，and all their eyes were closed against the visions from the sky．

“Dig，”croaked Black，“or I shall slay you！”He drew his pistol from his belt，and Littlejack his cutlass．Fearing death far more than apparition，the men began to dig，and as they dug，a clock began to strike，an unseen clock．The earth was suddenly hard and cold，and the blades of spades were bent and broken．“You've struck a chest，”cried Black，“an ironbound chest and oaken．”But what the men had struck was carbonate and carborundum，conglomerate or puddingstone，and something known as oölite or dogger．The clock continued striking．“I destroyed all clocks，”cried Black．

“All clocks save one，”said Andreus，“the clock that strikes in conscience．”The deep tones of the clock went on until the clock had struck eleven．And on this stroke a curious phenomenon occurred．Upon the ground，and all around，appeared a score of objects，each one different from the others．

“Containers！”Black's voice was hollow．“I should have destroyed containers，and the things contained therein．A curse on Hyde and his collective nouns！”

“What is in these things I do not know，but not a single one of them contains an O．”Littlejack's voice was bleak as he gazed at the odd collection：a chest，a trunk，a valise，and all sorts of cases，a barrel，a bag，and a bin，and all sorts of vases．

“A sack，a bucket，and a basket，”cried Black，“a crate，an urn，and even a casket．”His eyes grew dark and then they lit with a fiendish lightning．“The jewels！”he cried．“The precious stones！”

And Black and Littlejack，and Stragg and Strugg and all their men began opening the O-less containers，and in each one they found a single sheet of paper．And on each sheet a single word appeared，that gleamed and glowed and glittered．The clock struck twelve．

“It's noon，”cried Black，and all the people echoed，“Noon！”

Then they heard the ringing of a distant bell，sounding near and sounding nearer，ringing clear and ringing clearer，till all the sky was filled with music as by magic．

“Freedom！”Andreus cried，naming the gleaming word the men had found，the word that glowed and glittered．

“Freedom！”Andrea echoed after him，and the sound of the greatest word turned the vandals pale and made them tremble．

“I knew the word could not be doom，”the old man said，“or sorrow．I was afraid that it might be tomorrow．”

And then，as by a miracle of motion，the vandals stood upon the shore，and all the people of the island stood about them．“You hour has struck，”said Andreus．“Here is your ship．Begone．”

“The gangway and the decks are oozy with oysters！”cried Black，“and Portuguese men-of-war，and lobsters and an octopus．And swordfish are sawing something below the waterline，urged on by a horrid school of chortling porpoises！”

Hyde was suddenly up to his ankle in phantasmagoria．“Crabs，crayfish，prawns，shrimps，”he howled，“alias the decapods．Centipedes and spiders，alias the arthropods．Snails and slugs，alias mollusks and gastropods．”He thought he saw crickets，too，alias orthoptera，and a score of zooming bats，alias chiroptera．He turned and ran，pursued by rodents small and big，the rat，the rabbit，and the guinea pig．

The unseen clock struck one．“The mouse is running down the clock．I see him run，”said Littlejack．And all the crew saw things that weren't there as they clambered aboard the ship and set her gloomy sails，and headed slowly out to sea．And then，beyond the far horizon，the great O storms began to rage and roar，the hurricane （Connie，Dorothy and Flora，Imogene，Josephine and Nora），the typhoon and the monsoon，the cyclone and tornado，and there were cloudbursts and waterspouts and fog and snow，and whirlpools and maelstroms，and other odd phenomena，each with its O．The night came on and in the light of lightning there were those on shore who saw，or thought they saw，the head of the giant Orion rising out of the sea．And there were those on shore who saw，or thought they saw，the vengeful ships of the great explorers：Columbus，De Soto，Cortez，and Balboa，and all of the others since Jason and since Noah．

No word was ever heard of Black or Littlejack again，or Stragg or Strugg，or any of their men．A broken spar was washed upon the shore one day，and one black glove，but that was all．The outlawed lawyer Hyde，looking for a loophole in the law through which he might escape，was caught in one whose O's collapsed and buried him beneath its wreckage．And as he fell he heard another O，sounded by an old owl in a mossy oak，a little like an oboe obbligato．





Ⅹ


Working with valor and love and hope，the islanders put the O back in everything that had lost it．The name of Goldilocks regained its laughter，and there were locks for keys，and shoes were no longer shes．A certain couple once more played their fond duets on mandolin and glockenspiel．Ophelia Oliver，who had vanished from the haunts of men，returned，wearing both her O's again．Otto Ott could say his name without a stammer，and dignity returned to human speech and English grammar．Once more a man could say boo to a goose，and tell the difference between to lose and too loose．Every family had again a roof and floor，and the head of the house could say in English，as before：“Someone open （or close） the door．”Tower rose up again and fountains sparkled．In the spring the robin and the oriole returned．The crows were loud in caucus，and whippoorwill sang once again at night．The wounds that Black and Littlejack had made were healed by morning-glories，columbine，and clover，and a spreading comforter of crocuses．One April morning，Andreus and Andrea were wed．

“It could have been worse，”the old man said，riding back home from the wedding．“They might have taken A．Then we would have had no marriage，or even carriage，or any walks to walk on．”He wiped a tear from his eye．He was worrying about the loss of I，if I had been forbidden，when he came upon the lovers in a garden．“What would have happened，”he asked them both，“without indivisibility？”

“Or，for the matter of that，”said Andreus，“invincible？”

“Invincible，”the old man said，“is a matter of O．”

“What O？”asked Andreus and Andrea together．

“The O，lest we forget，”the old man said，“in freedom．”

Suddenly their thoughtful silence was changed to laughter．“Squck his thrug，”they heard the parrot squawking．

“He must have missed the ship，”said Andrea．

“And now he has the freedom of screech，”said Andreus．

And they took the green parrot into their cottage，and in the end he was squawking．“Watch the sea！”And whenever they heard this warning and alarm，the islanders sprang to their ramparts and their towers，and scanned the sea for sinister ships with sinister sails．

Many years went by，and then one day a very old man with a long white beard stood at the base of a towering shaft of marble，surmounted，high up in the sky，with a single letter of the alphabet that glowed and gleamed and glittered in every light and weather．

“What a strange statue，”a little boy cried．“A statue to a circle．”

“What a strange monument，”a little girl laughed．“A monument to zero．”

The old man sighed and scratched his head，and thought and thought，and then he said，“It has a curious and wondrous history．”

“Was it a battle？ And did we win？”the children cried．

The old man shook his head and sighed，“I'm not as young as I used to be，and the years gone by are a mystery，but't was a famous victory．”

The sun went down，and its golden glow lighted with fire the wonderful O．
