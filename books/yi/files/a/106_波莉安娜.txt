第一章　波莉小姐


一个六月的清晨，波莉·哈灵顿小姐急匆匆地走进厨房。波莉小姐平常并不这么急促，并且她对于自己礼数有加的行为感到尤为骄傲，但今天她却十分着急——是真的着急了。

正在水槽边洗盘子的南茜惊讶地抬起头。虽然她在波莉小姐的厨房里只工作了两个月，但已经十分清楚女主人不慌不忙的惯常作风。

“南茜！”

“是的，小姐。”南茜兴高采烈地回答道，但仍在擦拭着手中的水壶。

“南茜，”——波莉小姐的声音开始变得严厉起来——“当我跟你说话的时候，我希望你能停下手中的工作，认真听我说。”

南茜的脸窘得一下子就红了，她马上放下了壶，但擦壶的毛巾还搭在壶盖上，差点把壶打翻——这使她更加慌乱了。

“是的，小姐；我会的，小姐。”她结结巴巴地回答道，立马把壶扶正，匆忙转过身，“我在这儿一直忙活着呢，因为您一早专门儿叮咛，让我上午得把盘子拾掇好。”

她的女主人皱了皱眉头。

“行了，南茜。我并不想听你的解释，只是希望你能集中注意力。”

“是的，小姐。”南茜暗暗叹了口气，她很想知道到底用什么办法才能取悦这个女人。南茜之前从来没有“出门工作”过，但父亲的突然离世，让体弱多病的母亲成了寡妇，还留下了除她之外的三个年幼的弟弟妹妹，这使得这个女孩不得不做点什么来维持家用。她很高兴能够在山上大户人家的厨房里谋到一份工作——南茜来自六英里以外的“边远地区”。她知道波莉·哈灵顿小姐是老哈灵顿家族产业的唯一女继承人，也是镇上最富有的人之一。不过，那都是两个月前的事了。现在，她知道了波莉小姐是一个严厉的、不苟言笑的女人——一个听到小刀掉在地板上，或者关门时发出哐哐声都会皱眉的女人——但即便小刀和门都安安静静的，她也不会笑一下。

“南茜，完成了早上的工作之后，”波莉小姐开始说话了，“去把阁楼上楼梯口的那间小屋子打扫出来，收拾一下那张小床。当然，你得先把里面的箱子和盒子搬出来。”

“是的，小姐。请问我要把拿出来的东西放在哪儿呢？”

“放在阁楼前面。”波莉小姐犹豫了一下，继续说，“我想我还是先告诉你一声吧。我的外甥女波莉安娜·惠提尔小姐将要搬来和我同住了。她今年十一岁，会住在那间屋子。”

“哈灵顿小姐，一个小女孩儿——将要来这儿？啊，那太好了！”南茜大叫道，立马想到自己的小妹妹们为那个“边远地区”的家所带来的阳光。

“太好了？这可不是我想用的词，”波莉小姐生硬地回应道，“但不管怎么说，我还是要尽力而为。我希望自己是个好女人，并且我知道自己的责任所在。”

南茜的脸顿时红得发烫。

“当然了，小姐。我只是觉得一个小女孩儿到这儿来也许——也许能让您开心。”她结结巴巴地说。

“谢谢，”女主人冷淡地回答，“但我看我现在并不需要那样的东西。”

“但是，很显然，您——您想让她来，想让您姐姐的孩子来啊。”南茜鼓起勇气说。她隐约觉得自己应该对这个未曾谋面的孤独小人儿表示欢迎。

波莉小姐傲慢地扬起下巴。

“嗯，说真的，南茜，仅仅是因为我碰巧有了一个愚蠢至极的姐姐，不仅结了婚，还为这个本已很拥挤的世界带来了一个多余的孩子，我不明白为什么我应该特别想照顾她们。但正如我刚才所说，我希望我知道自己的责任所在。去把角落打扫干净吧，南茜。”她突然结束话题，离开了房间。

“是的，小姐。”南茜叹了口气，拿起擦干一半的水壶——壶已经变凉了，得重新冲洗一遍了。

波莉小姐回到自己的房间，再一次拿出了两天前从遥远的西部小镇寄来的那封信。这对她来说可算不上是一个意外的惊喜。这封信是写给“佛蒙特州贝尔丁斯维尔的波莉·哈灵顿小姐”的，信中写道：





亲爱的女士：

我很遗憾地告诉您，尊敬的约翰·惠提尔牧师两周前去世了，留下了一个孩子，一个十一岁的女孩。除了一些书外，他几乎什么也没有留下。正如您所知，他是小教会的牧师，薪水微薄。

我知道他是您已故姐姐的丈夫，从他的话里我得知你们家族的关系并不融洽。但他认为看在您姐姐的分上，您应该会愿意接管这个孩子，并让她在东部地区的家人之中长大成人。因此，我写了这封信给您。

当您接到这封信的时候，小女孩已经准备好，可以动身出发了。如果您能接管她，并回信告知她可以立马动身，我们将会十分感激。这里有一对夫妇很快将要动身前往东部地区。他们将会把她带到波士顿，并把她送上开往贝尔丁斯维尔的火车。当然，我们也会提前告知您波莉安娜到达的时间和火车车次。

希望能尽快听到您肯定的回复。

谦恭的

杰里米亚·欧·怀特





波莉小姐眉头紧皱，把信折好放进信封。一天前她已经回了信，表明自己当然愿意接收这个孩子。她希望自己能够充分意识到肩上的责任！——即使这项任务并不让人感到愉悦。

她现在坐在那儿，手上拿着信，回忆起了她的姐姐，珍妮——这个孩子的母亲。珍妮二十岁的时候就不顾家人劝阻，坚持嫁给了这位年轻的牧师。曾经有一位有钱的男士想娶她——家人也认为他比那位牧师好得多，但珍妮不这么想。这个有钱人阅历颇丰，家境殷实，为人称道，而那个牧师却只有一颗充满了年轻人理想和热情的稚嫩头脑，以及一颗充满爱的心。珍妮更喜欢这些——或许，这是很自然的。所以她嫁给了这位牧师，并作为一名国内传教士的妻子随他一起去了南方。

然后她们就分别了。波莉小姐对此记忆犹新，尽管作为家里最年幼的孩子，那时她只有十五岁。家里人很少同传教士的妻子联系。但有段时间珍妮经常给家里写信，她告诉家人她把两个妹妹波莉和安娜的名字合起来作为新出生的孩子的名字，“波莉安娜”——其他的孩子们全都夭折了。这是珍妮写的最后一封信，几年之后就传来了她的死讯，是传教士从一个西部小镇寄来的，虽然只有短短几行字，但却透着伤心欲绝的情绪。

与此同时，时间并没有为山上大宅的主人停留。望着山下遥远的山谷，波莉小姐开始思考二十五年的时光带给她的变化。

她已经四十岁了，仍然孤身一人活在这世上。父亲、母亲和姐姐们都相继离世。这么多年来，直到现在，她都是这所大宅唯一的女主人，继承了父亲留给她的数以千计的遗产。曾有人公开对她孤独的生活表示同情，也曾有人敦促她结交一些朋友或伴侣共同生活，但她拒不接受他们的同情和建议。她说自己并不孤独。她喜欢一个人生活。她喜欢安静。但是现在——波莉小姐满脸愁容，嘴唇紧闭地站起身。当然，她很高兴自己是一个善良的女人，不仅知道自己的责任所在，而且有足够的意志去完成它。但是——波莉安娜！——一个多么荒谬的名字啊！





第二章　老汤姆和南茜


在狭小的阁楼房间里，南茜正在卖力地打扫和擦拭，她特别注意了那些角落。说实在的，有很多次，她这样拼命工作，与其说是在充满激情地扫除灰尘，倒不如说是在释放自己的感情——南茜，尽管她因惧怕而服从于她的女主人，但她不是圣人。

“我——只是——希望——能够——把她——心里的——旮旯——搞明白！”她配合着手里尖锐的清洁棍猛戳的节奏，一字一顿地咕哝着，“得啦，得啦！太多地儿需得打扫啦！把那小可怜扔在这间又热又小的屋子里——冬天也没火烧！这么大个房子有那么多房间可供选择！果真是多余的孩子啊！哼！”南茜不停地念叨着，一边使劲地拧着抹布，手指都拧疼了，“我看现在啊，现在啊，多余的才不是小孩儿呢！”

她闷声不响地干了一会儿。干完活后，她带着明显的厌恶情绪打量这间简陋的小屋。

“好吧，不管怎样，我的活儿——算是干完了，”她叹了口气，“这儿一点灰尘都没有了——其他的东西也不见得有呀。小可怜啊！这确实是用来搁一个想家的、孤零零的小孩儿的好地方！”她结束了工作，走的时候砰的一声带上了门。

“噢！”她咬住嘴唇，脱口叫道，接着又嘴硬地说，“怎么了，我才不在乎呢。我偏想让她听见门响的声音——偏要，偏要！”

那天下午，南茜抽了个空去花园里见老汤姆。他在这个地方干除草和铲路的活已经数不清多少个年头了。

“汤姆先生，”南茜唤道，她快速地回了下头确保自己没有引人注意，“你知道一个小女孩儿要来和波莉小姐一块儿过了么？”

“一个——什么？”汤姆吃力地直起腰问。

“一个小女孩儿——要和波莉小姐一块儿住。”

“继续编吧，”汤姆不信地嘲笑道，“你怎么不告诉我太阳明个儿从东边儿落下去？”

“这是真的啦。她亲口告诉我的，”南茜证实道，“是她的外甥女，都十一岁啦。”

汤姆惊讶得张大了嘴巴。

“当然了！——现在，我想，”他喃喃自语，一束温柔的光线闪进老人浑浊的双眼，“她该不会是——肯定是——珍妮小姐的小女儿！他们婚后留下的就这一个孩子。南茜啊，那肯定是珍妮小姐的闺女。上天保佑！我这老眼还能看到这些！”

“珍妮小姐是谁？”

“她是天上落下的天使，”老汤姆激动地喘着气说，“但老爷和太太只把她当大闺女看。她二十岁就结婚了，很多年前就离开了这儿。我听说她的孩子都没活下来，除了最后一个。来的这位肯定是她喽。”

“她有十一岁了啊。”

“是的，她得差不多这么大啦。”汤姆点头道。

“她要睡那间小阁楼呢——太难为她了！”南茜责备道，又回头瞄了一眼大宅。

老汤姆皱了皱眉，嘴角立马露出一丝好奇的微笑。

“我倒是想看看波莉小姐在家会怎么对待这个孩子。”他说。

“哼！我倒是想瞅瞅这孩子在家会对波莉小姐做些什么！”南茜犀利地回应道。

汤姆笑了起来。

“我看你不大喜欢波莉小姐吧。”汤姆咧嘴笑道。

“说得好像有人喜欢她一样！”南茜不屑地说。

老汤姆怪怪地笑了笑，又弯下腰开始干起活来。

“我猜你可能没听过波莉小姐的爱情故事吧。”他缓缓地说。

“爱情故事——她的！没有！——我猜没有人听说过！”

“不，确实有这么回事儿，”老人家点点头，“那个人现在还活着——就住在咱们镇上。”

“是谁？”

“我可不能告诉你。我不能说。”老人家直起腰来。当他面向大宅时，从他灰暗的蓝色眸子里流露出的，是一个忠诚的侍者因他多年来侍奉和爱戴的家庭所产生的自尊心。

“但看上去不大可能啊——她和她的爱人。”南茜仍然不甘心。

老汤姆摇了摇头。

“你可不像我一样了解波莉小姐，”他解释道，“她过去可是个真正的美人儿呢——她现在也可以是，只要她自个儿想的话。”

“美人儿！波莉小姐！”

“是啊。只要她把绑得紧的头发放下来，随意一点，就像以前那样。再戴一顶那种上面有花儿的帽子，穿一件有白色花边儿的裙子——你就会看到她多漂亮！南茜，波莉小姐并不老。”

“她不老吗？那么，她是故意装得这么老咯——她就是很老，就是！”南茜不屑地说。

“是的，我知道。自从她和爱人之间出现问题之后，她就变成这个样子了，”老汤姆点头道，“从那以后，她就好像每天都在吃苦艾和蓟草一样——苦咧咧的，又多刺儿，不大好相处。”

“我看她就是这样的，”南茜忿忿不平地说，“没有什么能让她高兴，无论你怎么做、怎么努力都不会让她高兴！要不是家里人等着这份儿钱，我才不会在这里干呢。但总有一天——总有一天我会不干的，那就是我南茜要离开的时候。一定会有这么一天，一定会的。”

老汤姆摇了摇头。

“我知道，我能感觉到这些。这是很自然的——但并不是最好的，孩子。这不是最好的解决办法。记住我说的，这不是最好的。”说罢，他又低下头干起活来。

“南茜！”一个尖厉的声音响起。

“来，来了，小姐。”南茜结结巴巴地回答，立马匆匆回了宅子。





第三章　波莉安娜来了


电报如期而至，传来了波莉安娜将于次日，也就是六月二十五号下午四点抵达贝尔丁斯维尔的消息。波莉小姐看着电报，皱起了眉头，然后上楼来到阁楼的房间。就算是在检查房间的时候，她也是皱着眉头的。

房间里有一张整洁的小床、两把直背椅、一个脸盆架、一个没有镜子的衣柜，以及一张小桌子。天窗上没有挂布料窗帘，墙上也没有挂画。一整天阳光直射屋顶，小屋就像烤箱一样热。窗户上没有安纱窗，所以没有打开。一只焦躁的大苍蝇在一扇窗户边嗡嗡地飞上飞下，飞上飞下，急于想飞出去。

波莉小姐拍死了苍蝇，让窗框升起一英寸，把死苍蝇扫了出去，然后摆直了椅子，又皱了一下眉，离开了房间。

“南茜，”几分钟之后，她站在厨房门口叫道，“我在楼上波莉安娜小姐的房间里看到了一只苍蝇。窗户肯定被打开过。我已经定制了纱窗，但是到货之前我希望你能保证窗户一直是关闭的。我的外甥女将于明天下午四点抵达。我希望你去车站接一下她。蒂莫西会驾那辆敞篷小马车带你去。电报说我外甥女是‘浅色头发、红色格子裙，戴一顶草帽’。我所知道的就这些，不过我想这些足够你顺利接到她了。”

“是，小姐。但——您——”

波莉小姐显然明白南茜话里的意思，因为她皱着眉头，干脆地说：

“不，我不会去的。我想我没有这个必要。就这样。”随即她转身离开了——波莉小姐为她外甥女所做的安排已经足够多啦。

厨房里，南茜气呼呼地用熨斗在洗碗巾上使劲划拉了一下。

“‘浅色头发、红色格子裙，戴一顶草帽’——她知道的就这些。确实就这些啊！要是我的话，我可不好意思承认这些。绝对不好意思。要知道这可是千里迢迢穿越大陆而来的唯一一个亲外甥女啊！”

第二天下午三点四十的时候，蒂莫西和南茜就驾着敞篷小马车出发去迎接他们期待中的小客人了。蒂莫西是老汤姆的儿子。有阵子，镇上的人说，如果老汤姆是波莉小姐的右手，那么蒂莫西就是她的左手。

蒂莫西是个善良的年轻人，长得也英俊。虽然南茜来宅子时间不长，但他们已经成为好朋友了。但今天，南茜身兼重任，一改往日的叽叽喳喳，一路沉默不语。马车一到车站，她就跳了下来，直奔站台。

她一遍遍在脑海中重复着：“浅色头发，红色格子裙，戴一顶草帽。”她也不停地在想波莉安娜会是一个什么样的孩子。

“但愿她是个安静、懂事的小孩儿，不会把刀掉在地上，也不会把门关得砰砰响。”她叹了口气对慢悠悠向她走来的蒂莫西说。

“哎呀，如果她不是这样的孩子的话，那没人会知道咱们几个会变成什么样啦，”蒂莫西咧嘴笑道，“想象一下波莉小姐和一个闹哄哄的小孩儿！啊呀！汽笛响了！”

“噢，蒂莫西，我——我觉得让我过来接人实在是有点刻薄。”南茜吓了一跳，念念叨叨地转身飞奔到一处视野比较好的地方，以便能轻而易举地看到从小站出来的旅客们。

没多久，南茜就看到了她——一个穿着红色格子裙的单薄的小女孩，淡黄色的头发梳成两条粗粗的麻花辫垂在身后。草帽下面，一张充满期待的，有些雀斑的小脸正在左顾右盼，很明显是在找人。

南茜一下子就认出了她，但一时无法控制自己颤抖的膝盖，因此没有向她走去。当只剩下小女孩独自一人站在那里的时候，南茜才终于向她走去。“您是——波莉安娜小姐？”她结结巴巴地问道。话音刚落，她就被一双穿有格子花纹布料的手臂紧紧抱住。

“噢，我太高兴，太高兴，太高兴见到您啦，”一个热切的声音在她耳边大叫道，“当然，我就是波莉安娜！您能来接我，我真的太高兴了！我一直期盼着您来！”

“您——知道？”南茜吞吞吐吐地问，懵懵地思忖为何波莉安娜会知道自己，并希望自己来接她，“您——您知道？”她又问了一遍，试图把帽子系紧一点。

“噢，是啊，一路上我都在想您长什么样，”小女孩蹦蹦跳跳地大叫道，把尴尬不已的南茜从上到下看了个遍，“现在我知道啦，您长得就是您应该长得那个样子！真开心啊！”

蒂莫西走了过来，南茜终于松了口气。波莉安娜的话真是太让她摸不着头脑了。

“这是蒂莫西。您应该有行李箱吧。”南茜结结巴巴地说。

“有，有的。”波莉安娜点点头，很认真地说，“我有一个崭新的行李箱，是妇援会给我买的——她们多好心啊！在她们需要购买地毯的时候却给我买了行李箱，当然，我也不知道一个行李箱能买多大一块红色地毯，但应该能买一些的，或许能有半个走廊那么多呢。您说对吗？我书包里有一件小东西，格雷先生说是一副象棋。在我拿行李箱之前，我得把它送给您。格雷先生是格雷夫人的丈夫。他们是卡尔执事妻子的表亲。我跟他们一起来的东部，他们人特别好！喏，给您！”波莉安娜说完，从她背的书包里摸出一副象棋。

南茜长吸一口气。她本能地觉得有人要是像波莉安娜那样讲了这么长一串话，应该吸口气的。然后她偷偷瞄了蒂莫西一眼，他故意把目光移开了。

三个人终于离开车站了。波莉安娜的行李箱放在马车后面，而她本人舒舒服服地坐在南茜和蒂莫西中间。从车子出发起，小女孩全程都滔滔不绝地问着各种问题，直至南茜晕头转向地发现，为了跟上她说话的节奏，自己差点断气。

“看啊！这太有意思啦！家离这儿远吗？我希望离得远点——我喜欢坐马车呢，”当车轮开始转动时，波莉安娜叹了口气说，“当然啦，如果离得不远，我也不会在乎啰，因为我很开心能快点到家，您知道的。街道多美啊！我知道肯定很美，因为爸爸告诉过我的——”

她停下来，有点哽咽。南茜担心地看着她，看着她那小小的下巴不停地抖动着，眼睛里充满了泪水。不过，很快她就停止了啜泣，勇敢地抬起了头。

“爸爸都告诉我了。他都记得呢。在说这个之前，我要先解释一下。格雷夫人告诉过我——关于这件红色格子裙的事。你知道，为什么我没有穿黑衣服吗？她说您可能会觉得奇怪。这是因为教堂里实在找不出一件我能穿的黑色衣服，只有一件女士的天鹅绒紧身衣，但卡尔执事的妻子说它一点也不适合我，而且它还有白色的斑点——你知道的，穿太久被磨的——两个胳膊肘都是这样，别的地方也有。妇援会的一部分人想给我买黑色的裙子和帽子，但另一部分认为钱应该用来为教会买期盼已久的红地毯。但怀特夫人说这也无妨，因为她不喜欢穿黑色衣服的小孩子——我的意思是说，她当然喜欢小孩子啦，只是不喜欢他们穿的黑衣服。”

波莉安娜停下来喘着气，南茜才得以结结巴巴地说：

“嗯，我肯定这——这应该没有关系的。”

“很高兴您能这么想，我也是这样想的。”波莉安娜点头说，声音又开始哽咽起来，“当然了，如果穿上黑衣服的话就不大好高兴起来了——”

“高兴！”南茜惊讶地打断了波莉安娜的话。

“是的——爸爸去了天堂，和妈妈还有其他的人在一起。他让我一定要高兴。但这真的好难啊——真的很难，即便穿上红色格子裙，因为我——我真的很想念他。我总是忍不住想和他在一起，特别是当妈妈和其他人到上帝还有天使那儿去的时候，然而我除了妇援会什么都没有了。但现在我知道我的日子不会那么难过了，因为我有您了啊，波莉姨妈。能和您在一起我真是太开心了！”

南茜对这个被遗弃的小可怜的同情一下子变成了惊慌。“哦，可是——可是，亲爱的，您好像弄错了，”她结结巴巴地说，“我是南茜，根本不是您的波莉姨妈！”

“您——您不是波莉姨妈？”小女孩也结巴起来，显然很失望。

“不是。我只是南茜。我没想到您会把我当成波莉小姐。我们——我们一点也不像，我们并不像啊。”

蒂莫西咯咯地小声笑起来，但南茜并无暇去回应他眼中闪过的喜悦神色。

“但您是谁呢？”波莉安娜问道，“您看上去一点也不像妇援会的人呐！”

蒂莫西这次直接大笑出声来。

“我是南茜啦，是女工。我除了洗烫衣服不干——因为那是德金小姐的工作，其他啥活儿都干。”

“但是有一位波莉姨妈的吧？”小姑娘急切地问。

“打包票有一位啦！”蒂莫西插嘴道。

波莉安娜明显松了口气。

“噢，那就好。”她沉默了一会儿，接着又开始欢快起来，“你们知道吗？我好开心，尽管她没有来接我，因为我现在知道她一直在等我，并且除此之外，我还得到了你们。”

南茜的脸一下子就红了，蒂莫西意味深长地朝她一笑。

“这可是个相当华丽的赞美啊，”他说，“你干吗不谢谢这位小姐呢？”

“我——我正在想——波莉小姐。”南茜支支吾吾地说。

波莉安娜心满意足地舒了口气。

“我也是啊，我对她充满期待呢。你们可要知道，她是我唯一的姨妈。但之前很长一段时间我竟然不知道，直到爸爸告诉我，他说她住在山顶上一幢可爱的大房子里。”

“是的，您现在就能看见啦，”南茜说，“就是正前方那个有绿色百叶窗的白色房子。”

“哇，好漂亮啊！周围有那么多的绿树和草坪啊！我从来没有一下子见过那么多的绿草。南茜，我的波莉姨妈很有钱吗？”

“是的，小姐。”

“好高兴啊。有钱可是件好事呢。我从来没有见过有钱人，怀特家除外——他们是有些钱的。他们家每间屋子都铺着地毯，每星期日都吃冰淇淋。波莉姨妈家每星期日也吃冰淇淋吗？”

南茜摇了摇头，嘴唇抽动了一下，向蒂莫西投去会心的一笑。

“没有，小姐。我猜您的姨妈不喜欢冰淇淋，至少，我没有在她的桌子上见过。”

波莉安娜的表情黯淡下来。

“噢，她不喜欢吗？太遗憾了！我不明白她是怎样忍住不喜欢冰淇淋的。但是，我还是很高兴的，因为你要是不吃冰淇淋的话就不会像怀特夫人一样胃痛——你知道，我吃了她好多冰淇淋呢。不过，波莉姨妈家是有地毯的吧。”

“是的，她家有地毯。”

“每个房间里面都有吗？”

“嗯，差不多每间都有。”南茜回答道，但想到那个光秃秃什么也没有的阁楼小房间是没有地毯的，她不禁皱了一下眉。

“噢，太棒啦！”波莉安娜欢欣鼓舞，“我喜欢地毯。我们家以前是没有地毯的，只有两小块从募捐桶里捡来的小地垫，有一块还有墨水印。怀特夫人家里还有很多画，可漂亮啦。有玫瑰花，跪着的小女孩，小猫，小羊，还有狮子——不是在一起的喔，我是说，那些小羊和狮子。噢，当然，《圣经》上说他们会在一起的，但现在还没有——我是说，怀特夫人家里的画上还没有在一起。你们不喜欢画吗？”

“我——我不知道。”南茜快答不上来了。

“我好喜欢。我们家没什么画，募捐桶里面是很少有画的，你知道的。不过也确实有过两幅，但有一幅很不错，爸爸把它卖了钱给我买了几双鞋子。另外一幅却很糟糕，一挂上去就掉下来摔成碎片了，玻璃全碎了，我都哭了。不过我还是很高兴我们没有这些漂亮的东西，这样我就更加喜欢波莉姨妈家啦——因为我并没有对那些漂亮东西司空见惯。就好像在募捐桶中那么多褪色的棕色缎带中突然发现一些美丽的发带。天哪！多漂亮的房子啊！”当马车转到宽道上的时候，她突然住口。

蒂莫西在卸行李箱的时候，南茜瞅准机会低声对他说：“蒂莫西·德金，你可别再跟我提啥要走的事儿，就算你花钱雇我，我也不走啦！”

“要走？我可没那么说过，”年轻人咧嘴一笑，“你拉我走我都不走。这下咱们这儿可好玩了，一个小孩天天在眼前晃，比放电影儿还好玩呢！”

“好玩！——好玩！”南茜愤愤地重复道，“我猜对那个可怜的小孩儿来说，跟她姨妈一起生活可不止好玩吧。我觉得她需要个避难所。蒂莫西，我要成为她的避难所，我会的，会的！”她一边发誓，一边把波莉安娜带上宽阔的台阶。





第四章　阁楼上的小房间


波莉·哈灵顿小姐并没有起身去迎接她的外甥女。不过，当南茜和小女孩出现在客厅门廊的时候，她把目光从书中抬了起来，伸出一只手，每根冷冰冰的手指上都写着“责任”。

“你好，波莉安娜，我——”她还没有机会多说几句，波莉安娜就从客厅门廊的另一头飞奔过来，一下子扑到她还没有反应过来的直挺挺的膝盖上。

“哦，波莉姨妈，波莉姨妈，您能让我过来和您一起住，我都不知道自己该怎样开心才好。”她开始抽泣，“您不知道，以前我只有妇援会，而现在有了您还有南茜，还有这一切！这是多么让人高兴啊！”

“兴许是吧——尽管我并不怎么喜欢妇援会的人，”波莉小姐冷冰冰地回答道。她一边努力把紧紧抱着她的小手指分开，一边眉头紧皱地将目光投向站在门廊上的南茜，“南茜，没事了，你可以离开了。波莉安娜，够了，请站直，站好了。我还不知道你长什么样子呢。”

波莉安娜立马站直了身，笑得极为灿烂。

“是，我觉得您是不知道。但您看，我不太好看，脸上有好多雀斑。噢，我想我得先解释一下红色格子裙，还有胳膊肘上有白点的黑色天鹅绒长衫的事。我已经告诉南茜，爸爸说——”

“好了，别管你爸爸说的话了，”波莉小姐干脆地打断了她，“我想，你应该还有个行李箱吧？”

“噢，是的，波莉姨妈。我有一个很漂亮的行李箱，是妇援会给我的。但我里面并没有装很多东西——我是说我自己的东西并不多，募捐桶里最近没有什么小女孩的衣服，但爸爸的书都在箱子里面。怀特夫人说她觉得我应该留着。您知道，爸爸——”

“波莉安娜，”她的姨妈又一次尖锐地打断了她，“有件事情必须马上告诉你，那就是，我不希望你在我面前总是提起你的父亲。”

小女孩发着抖倒吸了一口凉气。

“为什么，波莉姨妈，您——您的意思是——”她忐忑不安地问。

她的姨妈接着说：“现在我们上楼去你的房间。我想你的行李箱已经放在那儿了。我告诉过蒂莫西直接拿上去——如果你有行李箱的话。跟我上来吧，波莉安娜。”

波莉安娜转过身，一言不发地跟着姨妈。泪水在她的眼眶里打转，但她的下巴却勇敢地高昂着。

“无论如何，我猜我应该为姨妈不让我提起爸爸而感到高兴，”波丽安娜心想，“这或许会心里好受些——如果我不提爸爸的话。总之，也许这就是她不想我提起爸爸的原因吧。”波莉安娜再次坚信这是姨妈的“好心”，她把眼泪眨了下去，急匆匆地寻找姨妈的身影。

现在她上了楼梯，她姨妈的黑色丝裙在她前面奢华地窸窣作响。她身后的房门敞开了，波莉安娜瞥见里面有暖色的垫子和缎面的椅子。她脚下华丽的地毯就像碧绿的苔藓延伸开来。镀金画框的每个边缘都明晃晃的，阳光透过窗帘蕾丝花边的朦胧网眼照了进来，闪着她的眼睛。

“噢，波莉姨妈，波莉姨妈，”小女孩兴高采烈地喘着气说，“多漂亮，多漂亮的房子啊！您如此富有，肯定开心极了！”

“波莉安娜！”刚走到楼梯顶的姨妈猛地回头，严厉地叫道，“你竟然那样对我说话——真让我惊讶！”

“怎么了，波莉姨妈，难道不是这样吗？”波莉安娜非常诚恳地问道。

“当然不是，波莉安娜。我希望自己不会因为上帝赐予的任何礼物而骄傲得忘乎所以，这是不道德的，”这位女士宣称道，“我当然不会因为富有而高兴。”

说完，波莉小姐转过身，穿过大厅，走向通往阁楼的楼梯门。现在，她很庆幸把这孩子安排到了阁楼的房间里。她最初的想法就是让自己的外甥女尽可能地远离自己，同时又能够把她安排在不会因为她的幼稚粗心而损坏家里贵重家具的地方。现在——事实证明这孩子这么早就表现出来了虚荣心——更幸运的是看样子安排给她朴素的房间是合乎情理的，波莉小姐心想。

波莉安娜兴奋的小脚丫吧嗒吧嗒跟在姨妈后面，蓝色的大眼睛急切地四处张望，恐怕漏了这漂亮房子里的任何一种美丽和有趣的东西。她的小脑瓜里充满了急于弄明白的那个令人兴奋的问题——这些华丽的房门里，哪一扇后面会是她的房间——那个布满窗帘、地毯还有画的美丽房间。这时，姨妈突然打开了一扇门走上了另一段楼梯。

这里面什么都没有，两面是光秃秃的墙。楼梯的顶端，阴暗的影子一直延伸到远处的角落，那里屋顶几乎快碰到地板了，地板上还放着数不清的行李箱和盒子。而且屋子里面又热又闷。波莉安娜下意识地把头抬高了点——好像快要喘不过气来了。然后她看到姨妈推开了右边的一扇门。

“就是这儿了，波莉安娜，这是你的房间。行李箱已经放在这儿了，你有钥匙吧？”

波莉安娜呆呆地点点头，眼睛睁得大大的，露出一些恐惧。

她的姨妈蹙了蹙眉。

“当我问问题的时候，波莉安娜，我希望你能大声回答而不是仅仅点头。”

“是的，波莉姨妈。”

“谢谢，这样好多了。我相信你需要的东西都在这儿了，”她瞥了一眼整齐地挂着毛巾的架子和水壶补充说，“我会让南茜上来帮你收拾行李。晚饭安排在六点钟。”说罢，她离开了房间，下楼去了。

在她离开后的一段时间里，波莉安娜一直站在原地一动不动，眼睛盯着她离开的方向。然后，她把大大的眼睛转向了空荡荡的墙面，空荡荡的地板，还有空荡荡的窗户。最后，她把目光转向了她的小行李箱，前不久它还放在遥远西部家中自己的小房间里。她跌跌撞撞地跑过去，跪倒在行李箱边，用手捂住了脸。

几分钟后，当南茜找到她时，她才站了起来。

“好啦，好啦，可怜的小羊羔，”她轻声低唤着，弯下身来，把小女孩拉入怀中，“我就是怕看见你这个样子。”

波莉安娜摇了摇头。

“我实在太不乖，太糟糕了，南茜——糟糕得可怕，”她啜泣着，“我始终没法让自己理解，上帝和天使们比我更需要爸爸。”

“他们并不比你更需要。”南茜肯定地说。

“噢——南茜！”波莉安娜的眼睛里充满惊恐，已经顾不及哭了。

南茜害羞地一笑，使劲揉了揉自己的眼睛。

“算啦，算啦，孩子，我当然不是这个意思了，”她轻快地大声说，“过来，咱们把你的钥匙拿来，把箱子打开，快点把你的衣服拿出来吧，快点啦。”

眼泪还在打转的波莉安娜拿出了钥匙。

“但我没有太多衣服。”她支支吾吾地说。

“那咱们收拾起来就更快啦！”南茜说。

波莉安娜突然就破涕为笑了。

“是啊！我应该高兴的，对不对？”她大叫道。

南茜瞪大了眼睛。

“为什么……当——当然了。”她有点迟疑地回应道。

南茜能干的双手不一会儿就把那些书啊，打了补丁的内衣啊，还有为数不多的几件寒酸的衣服收拾妥当了。这会儿，波莉安娜勇敢地微笑着，在房间里飞快地跑来跑去，把裙子一件件挂在衣柜里，把书整齐地码在书桌上，把内衣叠好放在五斗柜的抽屉里。

“我肯定——它会变成一个非常漂亮的房间。你觉得呢？”过了一会儿，她结结巴巴地说。

南茜没有回答。她的头整个埋在箱子里，显然她十分忙碌。波莉安娜站在五斗柜旁，有点怅惘地盯着头顶上光秃秃的墙。

“我也应该为这儿没有镜子而感到高兴，这样我就看不到我脸上的雀斑啦。”

南茜嘴里突然发出了奇怪的声音，但等波莉安娜转过身，她的头又埋进箱子里去了。几分钟后，波莉安娜站在一扇窗户旁兴奋地拍着手叫起来。

“噢，南茜，我从来没有见过这些呢，”她喘着气说，“看啊——从这儿看过去，看那些树还有房子，那漂亮的教堂尖顶，还有那闪闪发光，像银链子一样的河。南茜，有这么漂亮的风景，还有谁需要画呢？噢，姨妈让我住这间屋子，我真是太高兴了！”

让波莉安娜感到惊慌失措的是，南茜竟然哭了起来。波莉安娜赶紧跑到她身边。

“怎么啦，南茜？南茜——怎么啦？”她大叫道，然后又有点害怕地问，“这不会是你的房间吧？”

“我的房间！”南茜气愤地喊道，忍住泪水，“如果你不是天堂坠落的小天使，如果有的人之前没有忍气吞声——噢，天！她又在摇铃了！”说完这段令人惊讶的话后，南茜匆匆站起身，慌慌忙忙地冲出房间，咚咚咚地跑下了楼。

房间里只剩下波莉安娜一个人了。她回到窗户边，继续欣赏被自己称为“画”的窗外美景。过了一会儿，她轻轻碰了碰窗框，看样子她有点受不了屋子里的闷热了。令人高兴的是，窗框在她手下移动了一些。接着，窗户就完全打开了。波莉安娜把身子探出去，大口呼吸着新鲜甜美的空气。

然后她又跑到另一边的窗户前。那扇窗在她急切的手指下也唰地一下就打开了。一只大苍蝇掠过她的鼻尖，在屋子里嗡嗡乱飞。接着，一只只苍蝇接二连三地飞了进来，但波莉安娜并没有注意到。她有了一个惊喜的发现——就在窗户外面，有一棵大树正伸展着繁茂的枝桠，像是伸出的手臂，迎接她的到来。她突然大笑起来。

“我相信我能做到的。”她咯咯笑着。说罢，波莉安娜敏捷地爬到窗沿上，从这里能够很轻易地踏上最近的树枝。只见她像小猴子一样攀着树枝，来回荡着，直到抵达最低的树枝。但那朝向地面的最后一跳——即便对波莉安娜这种常爬树的人来说——还是怪可怕的。但她屏住呼吸，结实的小手臂轻轻一摆，四肢着地，落在了柔软的草坪上。她赶紧爬起来，紧张兮兮地环顾四周。

波莉安娜现在正处在大宅的后面，面前是个花园，有一个驼背老人正在干活。花园前面是一条小径，沿着小径可以穿过一片旷野到达一座陡峭的山坡脚下。山坡顶上有一棵孤零零的松树守卫在一块巨石旁边。对波莉安娜来说，此刻好像只有一个地方是世界上最值得去的，那就是——这个巨石的顶端。

她轻巧地转过身，一路小跑，绕过干活的驼背老人，穿过一排排整齐的绿色植物，有点上气不接下气地跑到了那条横穿旷野的小径……接着，她开始坚定地往上爬，心里却琢磨着，这石头在窗户边看着很近的呀，怎么爬起来这么远呢！





一刻钟后，哈灵顿宅子里走廊上的大钟敲响了六下。最后一响刚落下的同时，南茜摇响了晚餐的铃声。

一分钟，两分钟，三分钟过去了。波莉小姐皱了皱眉，拖鞋轻轻敲着地板。突然，她猛地站起来，走到大厅，十分不耐烦地向楼上张望。她仔细听了一会儿楼上的动静，然后转身冲进餐厅。

“南茜，”年轻的女仆一出现，她就果断地说，“我的外甥女迟到了。不，你不需要去叫她，”南茜刚向大厅的门口迈去，波莉小姐便严厉地补充道，“我已经告诉过她晚饭时间，现在她要为此付出代价。这样她才会从这次的教训中学会守时。她下来以后只能去厨房吃面包和牛奶。”

“是的，小姐。”波莉小姐没有看到南茜当时的表情，也许这样更好。

晚餐一结束，南茜就从后楼梯爬到了阁楼上。

“面包和牛奶，真是的！——那可怜的小羊羔只不过是哭着睡着了，”她忿忿不平地嘟囔着，轻轻推开了门，紧接着，她就惊讶地大叫起来，“你在哪儿呢？你去哪儿了？你去哪儿了？”她气喘吁吁地把衣柜、床下，甚至行李箱里面和水壶下面都翻了个遍。然后她飞也似的下楼，奔到花园里的老汤姆那里。

“汤姆先生，汤姆先生，那个可怜的孩子不见了，”她哀号道，“她悄无声息地回到天堂去了，她是从天堂来的，可怜的小羊羔——还告诉我给她厨房里的面包和牛奶——她正吃着天使的食物呢，我保证，我保证！”

老人家直起了身。

“走了？天堂？”他迟钝地重复着，目光无意识地扫视过落满晚霞的天空。他停下手中的活，朝着某处凝望了一会儿，然后转过身微微露齿一笑，说道：“好啦，南茜，她好像确实尽力要去天堂，确实是这样的。”他表示同意，并用弯曲的手指指了指红色天边映出的一个纤细的、被风吹拂着的身影。那身影正落在一块巨石顶上。

“好啦，她今晚是不会就那样去天堂的——不会像我说的那样啦，”南茜固执地说，“如果小姐问起的话，请告诉她我是不会忘记洗盘子的。但我得出去遛个弯儿。”她回头望了一眼，然后飞速跑向那条横穿旷野的小径。





第五章　游戏


“看在上帝的分儿上，波莉安娜小姐，您可是吓坏我了。”南茜跑到巨石下，气喘吁吁地说。此时，波莉安娜刚满怀歉意地从石头上滑下来。

“吓着你了？噢，太抱歉了。但你不用害怕的，真的，不用为我担心，南茜。爸爸和妇援会也常常这样，直到他们发现我总是能安全地回来。”

“但我不知道您跑出去啊。”南茜大叫道，用胳膊夹住小女孩的手，拉着她赶紧下了山。“我没看见您出去了，没有人看见。我猜您是不是直接就从屋顶上飞走了。我真是这么想的，真是这么想的。”

波莉安娜欢快地跳起来。

“我是这样的喔，差不多——不过我向下飞，而不是向上飞喔。我是顺着树下来的。”

南茜停下脚步。

“您——从哪儿？”

“从树上下来的，就是我窗户边上那棵树。”

“我的小祖宗啊！”南茜止住了呼吸，又急忙开始赶路，“我想知道您姨妈要是知道这些会怎么说！”

“你想知道？那好吧，我会告诉她的，这样你就可以看到她是什么反应啦。”小姑娘开心许诺道。

“天哪！”南茜喘着气说，“别啦，别啦！”

“为什么啊，你不是说她会在意的吗？”波莉安娜大声说，她显然很担心。

“不——呃——是——好吧，没关系。我——我并不真的关心她会怎么说啦。”南茜结结巴巴地说，下定决心要帮助波莉安娜免遭波莉姨妈的责骂，但愿没有别的惩罚，“但是，我们可得快点啦。我还得回去刷盘子呢，您知道的。”

“我帮你啊。”波莉安娜马上说。

“噢，波莉安娜小姐！”南茜并不同意这样。

她们沉默了一会儿。天色很快暗了下来。波莉安娜抱紧了她朋友的胳膊。

“不管怎么说，我有点高兴让你受到了惊吓——只是有点喔，因为这样你才会来找我。”她颤抖着说。

“可怜的小羊羔！您一定饿坏了吧。我——我恐怕您回去得和我一起去厨房吃面包和牛奶了。您的姨妈不喜欢这样——因为您没有下来吃晚餐——您知道的。”

“是啊，我没法去。我不是正在那上面嘛。”

“是的，但是——她并不知道呀！”南茜说道，干巴巴地挤出点笑声，“我很抱歉您要吃面包和牛奶，真的很抱歉。”

“噢，不会的，我很高兴啊。”

“高兴？为什么？”

“为什么？我喜欢面包和牛奶，我也喜欢和你一起吃。我不知道为此高兴有什么不应该的。”

“您好像对一切东西都感到高兴。”南茜回应道。一想到波莉安娜努力去喜欢自己那个光秃秃的小阁楼的勇气，南茜就有点说不出话来。

波莉安娜微微一笑。

“好吧，你要知道，这是一个游戏，嗯。”

“游——戏？”

“是的。是‘保持高兴’的游戏。”

“您到底在说啥呢？”

“啊，这是一个游戏。爸爸告诉我的。是一个很可爱的游戏呢，”波莉安娜回答道，“从我很小很小的时候，我们就总是一起玩这个游戏。后来我告诉妇援会的人，她们也开始玩了——我是说她们中的一些人。”

“是怎样的一个游戏啊？我还没玩过什么游戏呢。”

波莉安娜又笑了，但也叹了口气。在落日的余晖中，她的脸看上去又瘦削又心事重重。

“嗯，我们是从募捐桶里的一副拐杖开始玩起的。”

“拐杖！”

“是的。你看，我想要一个玩具娃娃，爸爸也写了信给他们。但是募捐桶送过来的时候，妇援会的女士在信上说她们没有收到任何玩具娃娃，只有这副小拐杖。所以她就把它寄来了，想着或许迟早某天对某个孩子能派上用场。我们的游戏就是从这里开始的。”

“呃，我不得不说，我从中看不出任何游戏的样子啊。”南茜着急地说。

“噢，是这样的，这个游戏就是从所有的事情中找到令人高兴的东西——不论是什么事情，”波莉安娜认真地解释道，“那时，我们就是从这副拐杖开始的。”

“噢，天哪！我看不出这有什么让人感到开心的——您想要一个玩具娃娃，却得到一副拐杖！”

波莉安娜拍了拍手。

“有的，有的，”她欢呼道，“我一开始也没看出来，南茜，”她很诚实地补充道，“爸爸只好直接告诉我了。”

“好吧，那么，您也会告诉我的吧。”南茜很急切地说。

“傻瓜呀！高兴当然是因为，你不——需——要——拐杖啊！”波莉安娜发出胜利般的大笑，“你看，一旦你知道怎么玩这个游戏，找到快乐就会变得相当容易呢！”

“好吧，这都是些什么奇奇怪怪的东西啊！”南茜喘着气说，有些惊恐地望着波莉安娜。

“噢，这一点都不奇怪啊——很有趣呢，”波莉安娜兴致勃勃地坚持道，“从那时起我们就开始玩这个游戏啦。事情越难，就越好玩，只不过——只不过有的时候真的是太难了——比如爸爸去了天堂，除了妇援会再也没有其他人的时候。”

“是的，再比如你被扔进那个屋顶上孤零零的小阁楼，一无所有的时候。”南茜气愤地说。

波莉安娜叹了口气。

“一开始确实有点难，”她承认道，“特别是在我感到很孤独的时候，我感觉我再也不想玩这个游戏了。而且我一直都期待能有漂亮的东西！但我恰巧想到，我可不愿意在镜子里看到脸上的雀斑，后来又看到了窗子外面那幅漂亮的风景画。所以，我知道我已经找到了令人高兴的东西啦。你看，当你在寻找令人高兴的事的时候，你就忘记了其他的事——就好像你想要的那个玩具娃娃。”

“呵！”南茜哽咽着，正尝试着把堵在喉咙里的东西咽下去。

“大部分令人开心的事不用花很长时间去寻找，”波莉安娜叹了口气说，“玩了很多次这个游戏，现在我已经连想都不用想啦！我已经习惯了这个游戏。这是一个很有趣的游戏。爸——爸爸和我过去都非常喜欢它呢，”她支吾地说，“不过，我想，它——它现在是有一些难了，因为我找不到人和我一起玩它了。但，或许波莉姨妈会呢。”她想了想，补充道。

“天哪——她？！”南茜倒吸了一口冷气，无声地说。接着，她又坚定地大叫道：“您看，波莉安娜小姐，我不说这个游戏我能玩得很好，我也不说我已经会玩这个游戏了，但我会和您一起玩的，可能玩不好——但我会跟你玩的，一定会的！”

“噢，南茜！”波莉安娜欣喜若狂，激动地抱住了她，“这太棒了！我们会很开心的，对吗？”

“呃——或许吧，”南茜有点迟疑地应着，“但您可别把宝全押在我身上。我可不是玩游戏的好手。但我会尽力把这个游戏玩好的。总之，算是有人跟你一起玩了。”说完，她们一起走进了厨房。

波莉安娜津津有味地吃完了面包和牛奶。然后，在南茜的建议下，她来到了客厅。波莉姨妈正在客厅里读书，她冷冷地把头抬起来。

“波莉安娜，你吃完晚餐了么？”

“是的，波莉姨妈。”

“我很抱歉，波莉安娜，你刚来就要求你去厨房吃面包和牛奶。”

“但我真的很高兴，波莉姨妈。我喜欢吃面包和牛奶，也喜欢南茜。您根本不需要为这么点小事感到抱歉。”

在椅子上的波莉姨妈突然坐直了身子。

“波莉安娜，你上床睡觉的时间到了。你今天可不轻松，明天我们必须要好好计划一下你的时间，看看有没有要买的衣服或者其他必需品。南茜会给你一支蜡烛，拿着的时候要当心。早餐在七点半，请保证准时下楼用餐。晚安。”

理所当然地，波莉安娜跑到姨妈身边，给了她一个热情的拥抱。

“到现在为止我都过得很高兴，”她开心地感叹道，“我就知道我将会很喜欢和您住在一起的，我在来这儿之前就该这么想。晚安。”她开心地叫道，跑出了房间。

“我的天！”波莉小姐差点没忍住喊出来，“真是个不同寻常的小孩！”接着，她又皱了皱眉，“我惩罚她，她感到很‘高兴’，我‘根本不需要为这么点小事感到抱歉’，她会‘很喜欢和我住在一起’！噢，我的天！”波莉小姐又感叹道，然后重新拿起了书。

一刻钟后，在阁楼的房间里，一个孤独的小女孩把床单裹得紧紧的，啜泣着：

“我知道的，爸爸，您正和天使们在一起，我现在不能再玩这个游戏了——一点也不能玩了。但就像我这样，一个人躺在黑乎乎的房间里，我不相信您能从中找到什么乐趣。如果我能离南茜或者波莉姨妈，甚至是妇援会的人近一点的话，也许会好一些！”

楼下的厨房里，南茜正在快速地干着没干完的活。她把抹布放进牛奶罐子，嘴里念念有词：

“如果玩这么一个傻乎乎的游戏——你想要一个玩具娃娃却得到一副拐杖——就能感到高兴——就能保护她的话——我会跟她一起玩的——我会的！我会的！”





第六章　责任的问题


到达后的第一天，将近七点的时候，波莉安娜就醒了过来。她的窗户朝向南边和西边，所以她看不到太阳，但可以看到早晨朦胧的蓝色天空。她知道这将会是晴好的一天。

小房间里现在比较凉爽，吹进来的空气中带着新鲜和甜美的味道。听到鸟儿们在窗外欢快地歌唱，波莉安娜便飞奔到窗边同它们说话。她看到姨妈正站在楼下花园的玫瑰花丛中，便立马收拾了一下，打扮整齐后去找她。

她匆匆跑下楼梯，她的房门和阁楼层的门都没顾得上关。她穿过大厅，又飞奔下另一段楼梯，砰的一声穿过前纱门，跑进花园里。

波莉姨妈正和那个驼背的老人一块儿，俯身查看一株玫瑰，波莉安娜咯咯地笑着，一下扑在她身上。

“噢，波莉姨妈，波莉姨妈，我今天早上还活着，我好高兴啊！”

“波莉安娜！”女士严厉地告诫道，她尽力想直起身来，但九十磅的波莉安娜正挂在她的脖子上，“这就是你平常向别人道早安的方式吗？”

小女孩松开手落到地面，欢快地上蹦下跳着说：

“才不是呢，我只有看到我爱的亲人才会忍不住这样做！我从窗户里看到您，波莉姨妈，就开始想，您可不是妇援会的人呢，您是我真正的亲姨妈啊！您看上去那么好，我得赶快下来拥抱您！”

驼背的老人突然转过了身来。波莉小姐蹙了蹙眉——倒是不像平常皱得那么厉害。

“波莉安娜，你——我——托马斯，早上就到这儿吧。我想你应该清楚了——我是说那些玫瑰。”她生硬地说完，然后就转身快步离开了。

“您一直在花园中干活吗，呃——先生？”波莉安娜颇感兴趣地问。

老人家转过身，他的嘴唇抽搐着，眼中雾蒙蒙的，像是噙着泪水。

“是的，小姐。我是老汤姆，这儿的花匠。”他回答说，小心翼翼地，但又好像被一种不可抗拒的力量驱使一般，伸出颤抖的手，在波莉安娜的金发上拍了拍，“您可太像您母亲了，小姐！我认识她的时候，她还没您大呢。您看，从那时候起，我就一直在这里干活儿了。”

波莉安娜感觉能够清晰地听见自己的喘息声。

“真的吗？您真的认识我妈妈吗——在她还没有成为天堂的天使，还是个人间的小天使的时候？噢，拜托给我讲讲她吧！”波莉安娜一屁股坐在泥径中间，傍在老人身旁。

宅子里响起了铃声，紧接着南茜就从后门飞奔了出来。

“波莉安娜小姐，这道铃声意味着该用早餐了，”她气喘吁吁地说着，拉起小女孩就往回跑，“其他时候的铃声意味着其他的饭点。但只要铃声一响，不管您在哪儿，只要听见铃声就得跑回家。如果您没回来的话——嗯，那咱们就得从因此产生的后果中找点高兴的事儿啦！”说完，她就像哄一只不守规矩的小鸡一样嘘啊嘘地把波莉安娜赶回了家。

早餐开始五分钟了，都没有人说话。波莉小姐厌烦的目光紧紧盯着两只在餐桌上飞来飞去的苍蝇，严厉地问道：

“南茜，这些苍蝇是哪里进来的？”

“不知道，小姐。厨房里一只也没有。”昨天下午南茜太激动，以至于没有注意到波莉安娜房间的窗户被打开了。

“我想，它们应该是我的苍蝇，波莉姨妈，”波莉安娜仔细观察了一下，笑盈盈地说，“今早有好多苍蝇在楼上过得很愉快呢。”

南茜赶紧离开房间，为此她不得不将刚端来的热松饼又端了回去。

“你的？”波莉小姐倒抽了一口气，“你说的是什么意思？它们是哪来的？”

“怎么啦，波莉姨妈。它们当然是从窗户外面飞进来的啦。我亲眼看着它们飞进来的。”

“你亲眼看着它们！你是说没有拉纱窗你就打开了窗户？”

“是啊，但那里本来就没有纱窗啊，波莉姨妈。”

这个时候，南茜又端着松饼进来了。她脸色严肃，但十分红润。

“南茜，”女主人严厉地说，“你把松饼放下，马上去波莉安娜的房间里把窗户关上，还有房门。干完早上的活以后，拿喷雾器把每一间房间都仔细检查一下。务必要彻底地检查。”

接着，她又对外甥女说：

“波莉安娜，我已经为你房间的窗户定制了纱窗。当然，我知道，这是我的责任。但你好像把你的责任全都抛在脑后了。”

“我的——责任？”波莉安娜的眼睛里充满了疑惑。

“当然。我知道天气转暖了，但我认为，你的责任就是确保你房间的窗户是关着的，直到纱窗送过来。苍蝇，波莉安娜，不只是肮脏和恼人，它们还对健康有害。吃完早饭，我给你一本关于这个问题的小册子读一读。”

“读书吗？噢，谢谢您，波莉姨妈。我最喜欢读书了。”

波莉小姐深深地吸了一口气，然后紧紧闭上了嘴唇。波莉安娜瞅到姨妈严肃的表情，若有所思地皱了皱眉头。

“当然，波莉姨妈，我很抱歉忘记了自己的责任，”她小心翼翼地道了声歉，“我再也不会把窗户抬起来了。”

她的姨妈没有回答，一直到早餐用完她都没有开口。随后，她起身走到客厅里的书柜前，抽出一本小册子，穿过房间，递到外甥女手中。

“这就是我刚才说到的那篇文章，波莉安娜。我希望你立刻回房间读一读。半个小时之后我上去检查。”

波莉安娜的眼睛盯着上面被放大了很多倍的苍蝇头部的插图，兴奋地大叫：

“噢，谢谢您，波莉姨妈！”说完，她马上开心地蹦跳着离开了房间，门在她身后面砰地关上了。

波莉小姐皱了皱眉头，迟疑了一下，然后庄严地穿过房间，打开了房门，但波莉安娜早就不见了踪影，只听见阁楼台阶在咚咚咚地响着。

半个小时之后，波莉小姐也踏上了这些台阶，脸上的每一根线条都表露着严肃的责任，她走进波莉安娜的房间，再次受到了一阵热情急切的欢迎。

“噢，波莉姨妈，我这辈子还没见过这么有趣好玩的东西呢。您给我这本书，让我读，真是太让我高兴啦！哎呀，我以前怎么没有想到苍蝇的脚上会携带这么多东西呢，还有——”

“是的，”波莉姨妈严肃地打断了她的话，“波莉安娜，你现在可以把你的衣服拿出来，我要看一看。当然，我会把那些不适合你的拿给沙利文一家。”

波莉安娜明显不情愿地放下了手中的小册子，转身走向衣柜。

“我恐怕您会比妇援会的人还要觉得它们糟糕——她们说我的这些衣服太寒酸了，”她叹了口气，“但最近两三个募捐桶里的衣服大部分是给男孩或者老年人的——您有募捐桶吗，波莉姨妈？”

看到姨妈震惊得要发怒的样子，波莉安娜立刻纠正说：

“噢，您当然没有啦，波莉姨妈！”她赶忙说，脸红得发烫，“我忘记啦，富人家从来不会用这些东西的。但您看，有的时候我总会忘记您很有钱——特别是在这个房间里面的时候。”

波莉小姐愤怒地张了张嘴，但没说出什么话来。波莉安娜丝毫没有意识到自己说了最让人难堪的话，还在接着说：

“我要说的是，你是说不好募捐桶里有什么的——除了你在里面找不到你想要的东西，甚至你不想要的。每次都是因为募捐桶，我和爸爸的游戏才难以玩下去的，因为爸爸和——”

波莉安娜及时想起她不能在姨妈面前提起爸爸的事，于是她一头扎进衣柜里，很快用双臂抱出了那些破旧的小衣服。

“它们一点都不好看，”她抽泣道，“要不是她们要给教堂买红地毯的话，这些衣服就会是黑色的了。这些就是我所有的衣服了。”

波莉小姐用指尖拨了拨皱成一团的衣服。它们很明显不是特地为波莉安娜缝制的。然后她又皱着眉看了看抽屉里的内衣。

“我身上穿的已经是最好的了，”波莉安娜着急地辩解道，“妇援会就给我买了这么一套。琼斯夫人——她是妇援会的主席——告诉她们，即使她们以后不得不在光秃秃的走廊上哒哒哒地走，我也应该有一套新衣服。但她们并不想这样。怀特先生受不了噪音，他的太太说他神经紧张。可是他很有钱啊，她们希望他能为铺地毯的事多出点钱——因为他神经紧张，您知道。我觉得他应该很开心，因为即使他神经紧张，但他有钱啊。您觉得呢？”

波莉小姐好像并没有在听。她仔细检查完内衣后，转过身来有些唐突地问道：

“你应该上学了吧，波莉安娜？”

“噢，是的，波莉姨妈。除此之外，爸——我的意思是，我在家里也有人教的。”

波莉小姐皱了皱眉。

“很好。秋天的时候，你将进入这儿的学校上学。霍尔校长会安排你去该去的年级。还有，我希望能够每天听你大声朗读半个小时。”

“我喜欢阅读，但您要是不想听到我读的话，我给自己读也会很高兴的——真的，波莉姨妈。我一点都不是假装高兴的，我最喜欢自己读给自己听了——您知道的，因为那些大大的字母。”

“我不会怀疑这点，”波莉小姐冷冰冰地说，“你学习过音乐吗？”

“不是很多。但我不喜欢自己的演奏——我喜欢别人的。我学过一点钢琴。是格蕾小姐——她为教堂演奏——教我的。但我很快就忘光了，跟没学过一样，波莉姨妈。是真的。”

“我看也是，”波莉姨妈说，眉毛向上扬了扬，“不过，我想我应该有责任把你培养成至少具备音乐基础的人。你肯定会针线活吧？”

“是的，小姐。”波莉安娜叹了口气，“是妇援会的人教我的，但我真是学得太糟糕了。琼斯夫人不认可我学习其他人拿针穿过扣眼的姿势，怀特夫人认为应该在学习缝边线（或者其他方式）之前先掌握回针，哈里曼夫人认为我根本就不应该学习拼缝。”

“那好吧，以后这些都不再是难事，波莉安娜，我亲自教你缝纫。当然，我猜，你应该不会烹饪吧？”

波莉安娜猛然大笑起来。

“她们今年夏天才开始教我，但我还没学会呢。她们对这事的分歧比缝纫还大。她们打算从烤面包开始教我，但竟然没有两个人的方法是一样的。所以在一次缝纫会上，经过讨论，她们决定每周花一个上午的时间，轮流来教我——在她们自己的厨房里，您知道的。我才刚学会做巧克力软糖和无花果蛋糕，然后——然后就不得不结束了。”她的声音低了下来。

“巧克力软糖和无花果蛋糕，好吧！”波莉小姐嘲讽地说，“我想我们很快就会补回来。”她停下来考虑了几分钟，然后慢慢地说，“每天早上九点钟，你要在我面前大声朗读半个小时的书。在那之前，你需要花时间把这间屋子收拾得井井有条。星期三和星期六上午九点半，你在厨房里跟着南茜学习烹饪。其他的早晨跟我学习缝纫，下午学习音乐。当然，我会马上给你找一位老师的。”她从椅子上站起来，果断地说。

波莉安娜失望地大叫道：

“噢，波莉姨妈，波莉姨妈，您没有给我留下一点时间去——去生活啊。”

“生活？孩子！你这是什么意思？好像你没在生活似的！”

“噢，我在做那些事的时候当然是有呼吸的，波莉姨妈，但是我并没有在生活啊。您睡觉的时候也是有呼吸的，但您并没有生活着。我说的生活——是做你想做的事，比如去外面玩啦，自己阅读啦，爬山啦，跟汤姆先生在花园里聊天啦，还有跟南茜聊天，还有去我昨天经过的美丽街道上的房子里、人群中，以及所有的事情里发现一些故事啦。这才是我说的生活，波莉姨妈。仅仅是呼吸的话，那不叫生活！”

波莉小姐怒气冲冲地抬起了头。

“波莉安娜，你真是一个不同寻常的孩子！你当然会有合适的玩耍时间。但是，对于我来说，如果我要履行我的责任把你照顾和教育好，你也应该完成自己的责任，不能把良好的照顾和教育没良心地白白浪费掉。”

波莉安娜呆住了。

“噢，波莉姨妈，说得我好像没良心地——对您忘恩负义了一样！不，我爱您——您不是妇援会的人，您是我的亲姨妈啊！”

“很好，那我们就看看你到底有没有心存感恩吧！”说完这施舍似的话语，波莉小姐转身走出了门。

当她下到一半楼梯的时候，一个微小、颤抖的声音在身后响起：

“求求您，波莉姨妈，您还没有告诉我哪些东西是您想——想送人的呢。”

波莉姨妈发出了一声厌烦的叹气——这声叹气直接就传到了波莉安娜的耳朵里。

“噢，我忘了告诉你了，波莉安娜。蒂莫西今天下午一点半会载我们到镇上去。作为我的外甥女，你没有一件衣服是适合的。如果我允许你穿着其中任何一件出去见人，那我真是一个太不负责任的人了。”

现在该波莉安娜叹气了——她确信自己会很讨厌这个词——责任。

“波莉姨妈，求您了。”她渴望地说，“除了——责任，还有别的使您开心的事吗？”

“什么？”波莉小姐惊讶地抬起头，脸涨得通红，她极度愤怒地转身，快速地走下了楼梯，“不许无礼，波莉安娜！”

在闷热而狭小的阁楼里，波莉安娜一屁股跌坐在直背椅上。对于她来说，生活就像是织布机上织着的纱线，缠绕着没完没了的责任。“我真的没觉得有什么无礼的行为啊，”她叹气道，“我只是问问她能否告诉我除了责任之外还有什么开心的事呢。”

波莉安娜默默地坐了一会儿，难过地望着床上那堆破旧的衣物。然后，她慢慢站起来，开始收拾这些衣服。

“我看真是没有什么值得高兴的事呢，”她大声说，“除非——等到这些责任全部被完成，才会高兴！”说完，她突然大笑起来。





第七章　波莉安娜和惩罚


下午一点半，蒂莫西载着波莉小姐和她的外甥女去了离家半英里的镇上，逛了四五家服装店。

重新装配波莉安娜的衣柜，对于所有人来说，都或多或少是件令人兴奋的事。波莉小姐为此终于松了口气，她感到一阵无力的放松，就好像刚刚从火山脆弱的表面历经危险后，终于走到了稳固的地面上。那些守候在她俩身旁的形形色色的店员则为此憋红了脸颊，波莉安娜妙趣横生的故事，足够让她们的朋友开怀大笑上好几周。波莉安娜则保持着灿烂的笑容和心满意足的样子，还对一个店员说：“当你只能靠着妇援会的募捐桶来打扮自己的时候，能够直接走进来买这些崭新的衣服，实在是太棒了！再也不需要因为衣服不合身而把裙边卷起来或者放下去。”

购物的旅程持续了整整一个下午。晚餐过后，波莉安娜在花园里跟老汤姆愉快地聊了会儿天，然后就到后院的门廊上等着南茜洗完盘子，又同她聊上了一会儿。而波莉姨妈则去拜访邻居了。

老汤姆告诉了波莉安娜关于她母亲的很多趣事，这真的令她非常开心。南茜告诉了她所有有关那个位于六英里以外“边远地区”的小农场的事情。在那里住着她亲爱的妈妈，还有弟弟和妹妹们。她也向波莉安娜保证，只要波莉小姐允许，就带波莉安娜回家看望他们。

“他们都有着很棒的名字呢，您会喜欢他们的名字的。”南茜感叹道，“他们是‘阿尔戈农’‘芙罗拉贝尔’，还有‘艾斯黛儿’。而我——我恨透了‘南茜’这个名字！”

“噢，南茜，干吗说这样丧气的话啊！为什么这么说啊？”

“因为它不像他们的那么好听啊。您看，我是家里第一个孩子，妈妈生我那阵子还没读过那些里面有好听名字的故事呢。”

“可我喜欢‘南茜’啊，只是因为你叫这个名字。”波莉安娜义正词严地说。

“哼！好吧，我猜您也会喜欢‘克拉丽莎·玛贝尔’这个名字吧，”南茜回了一句，“要是能有个这样的名儿，那我可得高兴坏了。这个名字太棒啦！”

波莉安娜笑起来。

“好吧，无论如何，”她咯咯地笑着说，“你应该庆幸那不是‘赫夫齐芭’啊。”

“赫夫齐芭！”

“是啊，这就是怀特夫人的名字。她的丈夫叫她‘赫普’，可她并不喜欢被他这么叫。她说当他叫‘赫普——赫普’的时候，她感觉好像他下一秒就要叫‘好哇！’她可不喜欢被人好哇好哇地叫。”

南茜闷闷不乐的脸上绽开了笑容。

“哇，您可真了不起！看，您知道吗？我现在一听到别人叫我‘南茜’，我就会想到‘赫普——赫普’这让人发笑的事。天哪，我想，我真是太开心啦。”她停顿了一下，然后用惊异的目光望着这个小女孩，“哎，波莉安娜小姐，您是不是——在跟我玩那个游戏——让我因为自己不叫赫夫齐芭而高兴呢？”

波莉安娜皱了皱眉，然后大笑起来。

“啊呀，南茜，就是这样的啊！我正和你玩这个游戏呢——但这跟之前一样，我还没有想到就开始玩了。你看，玩过很多次后，你就会习惯去——寻找一些让人高兴的事。如果你找的时间足够长的话，咱们总是能找到高兴的事的。”

“好吧，或——或许吧。”南茜答应着，但明显还是不大相信。

晚上八点半了，波莉安娜上楼准备睡觉。纱窗还没有送到，这封闭的小房间就像烤箱一样。波莉安娜双眼渴望地盯着两扇紧闭的窗户——但她最终没有打开它们。她脱了衣服并把它们叠好，做完祷告，吹灭蜡烛，爬上了床。

她自己也不清楚到底痛苦地在床上翻来覆去了多长时间。但她觉得自己忍了足有好几个钟头，最终还是忍不住下了床，摸索着穿过房间，打开了房门。

阁楼周围一片黑暗，就像黑天鹅绒的颜色。一束月光从东边的天窗射进来，在地板上映出了半条银色的小径。波莉安娜深深吸了一口气，决意不顾四周可怕的黑暗，径直踏上银色的月光小径，爬到了窗台上。

她原本希望这里的窗户安了纱窗，可惜没有。但她知道，窗户外面是一片仙境一样美丽的宽广世界，那里有新鲜甜美的空气，能够让她滚烫的脸颊和双手感到惬意。

她越靠越近，眼睛期待地盯着外面。她看见，窗户下面只有一条小路，就位于马车出入口上方波莉小姐的日光浴室那又宽又平的锡皮屋顶上。她眼神里充满了渴望，心想要是现在能在那儿该多好啊！

她胆战心惊地往后望了一眼，身后是她闷热的小屋和愈加热腾腾的小床。从她站的地方到那儿之间是一片可怕的黑暗沙漠。要想回去的话，非得伸开畏缩的手臂摸索前行不可。而在她面前的，是日光浴室的屋顶、皎洁的月光，以及夜晚清凉甜美的空气。

要是她的床在那外面该多好啊！也确实有许多人是睡在外面的。老家的乔·哈特利不就是因为得了肺痨，不得不睡在外面吗？

波莉安娜突然想起来，她曾看到在阁楼窗户附近有一排用钉子挂起来的白色袋子。南茜说里面装的是冬天的衣服，到了夏天就收起来了。波莉安娜有点害怕，她摸索着找到了这些袋子，选了其中一个胀鼓鼓、软噗噗的（里面装的是波莉小姐的海貂大衣）充当床。她又选了其中一个小点的，把它折起来充当枕头，以及一个几乎是空的袋子充当被子。装备好了以后，波莉安娜欣喜若狂地踏着轻快的步子回到月光下的窗户边。她抬起窗框，把装备从窗户里塞出去，让它们掉落在房顶上。然后她自己也爬了出去，并转身把窗户仔细地关上——波莉安娜没有忘记那些苍蝇令人惊异的脚上带的那些东西。

真是太凉爽了！波莉安娜长长地、深深地呼吸着鲜美的空气，开心地跳上跳下。脚下的锡皮屋顶发出咔嚓咔嚓的轻声回响，她真是太喜欢了。她从头到尾来来回回走了两三遍——从闷热的小房间里出来，来到这空气流通的地方，让她的心情非常舒畅。房顶是如此的宽敞和平坦，她丝毫不用担心掉下去的风险。终于，她心满意足地舒了口气，蜷缩在海貂皮床垫上，把一个袋子当枕头，另一个当被子，准备开始睡觉。

“纱窗没来我真是太高兴了，”她自言自语着，眨着眼睛望着天上的星星，“不然的话，我怎么能有这些呢！”

波莉小姐的房间紧邻日光浴室。此刻她正慌忙地穿上睡衣和拖鞋，脸色也因为恐惧而变得苍白。一分钟前她刚刚用颤抖的声音给蒂莫西打完电话：

“快点上来！叫上你父亲！点上灯笼！有人在日光浴室的房顶上。他应该是从玫瑰棚子上面，或者不知道什么地方爬上来的。他肯定能从阁楼东边的窗户爬进房间。我已经把阁楼的门锁上了——快点，快点！”

不一会儿，就在波莉安娜马上要进入梦乡的时候，她突然被一束灯光照醒了，还听到了三声惊呼。

她睁开眼睛，发现蒂莫西站在梯子的顶端，老汤姆刚刚爬出窗户，她的姨妈正在他身后向外张望。

“波莉安娜，你到底在干吗呢？”姨妈大叫。

波莉安娜睡眼惺忪地坐了起来。

“怎么了，汤姆先生——波莉姨妈！”她结结巴巴地说，“不要害怕！您知道，我没有像乔·哈特利那样害肺痨，只是那里太热了，我才来这儿的。但波莉姨妈，我把窗户关上了，苍蝇不会把那些细菌带进屋的。”

蒂莫西很快就从梯子上爬下去了。老汤姆也马上把油灯塞到波莉小姐的手上，跟着儿子走了。波莉小姐嘴唇闭得紧紧的——直到两个男人离开了，才开始严厉地说：

“波莉安娜，马上把那些东西交给我，走过来。你可真是有能耐啊！”她大声喊了几句，等波莉安娜走到她跟前的时候，便转身提着油灯回到了阁楼。

对于波莉安娜来说，呼吸完门外凉爽的空气之后，现在觉得更闷热了。但她并没有抱怨，只是颤抖着深深叹了口气。

波莉小姐站在楼梯口厉声说：

“波莉安娜，后半夜你去我床上同我一起睡。纱窗明天到，但在那之前，我有责任知道你的行踪。”

波莉安娜倒吸了一口气。

“和您一起？在您床上睡？”她欢天喜地叫着，“噢，波莉姨妈，波莉姨妈，您真是太好了！我是多想有人——我自己的家人，而不是妇援会的人，跟我一起睡啊。我跟她们一起睡过。天啊！那些纱窗没安，我真是太高兴了。您不高兴吗？”

波莉小姐没有回答，径直往前走。说实话，波莉小姐真是有点莫名其妙地感到无助了。自从波莉安娜来了以后，这已经是第三次惩罚她了——这也是第三次波莉安娜把她的惩罚当成特殊的奖励。无怪乎波莉小姐会感觉到莫名的无助了。





第八章　波莉安娜的拜访


没过多久，哈灵顿大宅的日常生活看上去就已经步入正轨——尽管并不像波莉小姐起初规划的那样井井有条。波莉安娜学习缝纫、不断练习大声阅读、在厨房学习烹饪，这些都是真的。但她在这些事情上花的时间并不像开始计划的那么多。她花了更多的时间去“生活”，就像她说的那样。几乎每个下午，从两点到六点，都是她做自己喜欢的事情的时间——只要她正好不“喜欢”做那些被波莉姨妈明令禁止的事。

或许问题在于，波莉安娜拥有的这些自由时间，到底是她在学习之余被给予的放松呢——还是波莉姨妈从波莉安娜身上暂时解脱一会儿呢？在七月初的几天里，波莉小姐发现她已经大叫了很多次“多么不同寻常的孩子！”了。阅读和缝纫课也必定都是以她的头昏脑涨和筋疲力尽结束的。

而厨房里南茜的遭遇就要好得多了。她既不头昏脑涨，也不筋疲力尽。对于她来说，星期三和星期六反而像是节日一样。

哈灵顿宅子附近没有孩子与波莉安娜一起玩耍。房子本身就处在村子边缘的地方，虽然说不远处也有其他的房子，但那里并没有同波莉安娜年纪相仿的男孩或女孩。不过，这好像并没有影响到波莉安娜。

“噢，不，我一点也不介意呢，”她跟南茜解释道，“到处走走，看看街道还有房子，瞧瞧那些人，我就很开心了。我就是喜欢和大家在一起。难道你不喜欢吗，南茜？”

“呃，我不能说——所有的人我都喜欢。”南茜简洁地回应道。

几乎每一个令人愉快的下午，波莉安娜都会乞求一个“跑腿的差事”。这样的话，她就可以到处走来走去。而就是在这期间，她经常会遇到一位男士。波莉安娜一直将他称作“男士”，即使她一天中会遇到很多其他的男士。

这位男士经常穿一件黑色的长外套，戴一顶高高的丝绸帽子——一般的男士可不会这么打扮。他的胡子刮得很干净，脸色很苍白，帽子下面露出的头发有些灰白了。他走路的时候身子挺得笔直，而且速度相当快。他总是独来独往，这让波莉安娜有些可怜他。或许也是这个原因让她有一天终于开口对他说话了。

“您好，先生。今天天气真好啊，是吧？”她走近他，开心地说。

那位男士快速朝四周瞄了一眼，迟疑地停下了脚步。

“你是在——跟我说话吗？”他尖声问道。

“是的啊，先生，”波莉安娜满脸笑容，“我说，今天天气很不错呢，对吗？”

“呃？噢！哼！”他嘟囔着应道，继续大步前行。

波莉安娜大笑起来，心想，这个人可真好玩。

第二天，她又遇见了他。

“今天的天气可不如昨天好呢，不过也还可以啦。”她开心地朝他说。

“呃？噢！哼！”他像昨天那样，又嘟囔着应道，波莉安娜又开心地笑起来。

当波莉安娜第三次以同样的方式向他打招呼的时候，这个人突然停了下来。

“听着，小孩，你是谁？为什么每天都要跟我说话？”

“我是波莉安娜·惠提尔。我觉得您看上去很孤单呢。很高兴您能停下来。咱们互相介绍一下吧——我还不知道您的名字呢。”

“呃，那些个——”他没有说完，便以更快的速度大步往前走了。

波莉安娜望着他的背影，一直微笑的嘴角失落地垂了下来。

“也许他不是很明白——介绍只做了一半。我还不知道他的名字呢。”她咕哝着离开了。

今天波莉安娜要去给斯诺夫人送牛蹄冻。波莉·哈灵顿小姐每周都会给斯诺夫人送些东西，说她认为这是她的责任。因为斯诺夫人家境贫寒，体弱多病，并且是她教会的一员——当然，教会里所有的教友都有责任照顾她。波莉小姐通常是在星期四的下午履行她对斯诺夫人的责任，不是亲自去，而是由南茜代劳。今天，波莉安娜讨要了这份特权，南茜经过波莉小姐的同意，立马给了她。

“不干这活儿，我可太高兴了，”南茜私底下对波莉安娜说，“不过，让您摊上了这事儿，我还真有点过意不去。小可怜啊，这确实难为你啦！”

“但是我喜欢做这事啊，南茜。”

“好吧，您一旦做过一次后——就不会这么说啦。”南茜语气酸溜溜地预言道。

“为什么呢？”

“因为没人喜欢做这事儿。要不是人们看她可怜，从早到晚都不会有一个人靠近她。她脾气太坏啦。她女儿真是够可怜的，还得照顾她。”

“为什么会这样，南茜？”

南茜耸了耸肩。

“好吧，说白了，斯诺夫人眼里就没有对的事儿。一周里没有一天是让她满意的。如果今天是星期一的话，她就想着，咋不是礼拜天呢。如果你给她带了肉冻，就会听到她说想吃鸡肉——但你要是给她带了鸡肉，她又会说想喝羊肉汤！”

“哈，这么有趣的人啊，”波莉安娜笑道，“我认为我想去看看她。她肯定是一个令人惊讶，与众不同的人。我喜欢与众不同的人。”

“哼！好吧，斯诺夫人的‘与众不同’，好吧——但愿如此！”南茜冷笑着说。

波莉安娜一直想着南茜的话，直到她走进了那座破败小屋的门。她眼睛里闪烁着兴奋的光芒，想着马上就要见到这位“与众不同”的斯诺夫人了。

她敲了敲门，一个脸色苍白、满面倦容的年轻女孩给她开了门。

“您好，”波莉安娜礼貌地打招呼，“我是波莉·哈灵顿小姐家的，想看望一下斯诺夫人。”

“好吧，如果你愿意，你可是第一个‘想’来看她的人。”女孩低声咕哝着，但波莉安娜并没有听到这些。女孩转身带着波莉安娜穿过客厅来到了后面的房间。

她把波莉安娜领进病房后就关门出去了。波莉安娜眨了一会儿眼睛，才适应了屋内昏暗的光线。然后，她就看到了屋子另一端一个女人斜倚在床上的模糊身影。波莉安娜立马走上前去。

“您好，斯诺夫人。波莉姨妈说她希望您今天能感觉好一点，还让我给您带了一些牛蹄冻。”

“我的天！牛蹄冻？”一个厌烦的声音咕哝着，“当然，我是非常感谢的，但我本希望今天是羊肉汤的。”

波莉安娜皱了一下眉头。

“是吗？我还以为人们给您带牛蹄冻的时候，您应该想要鸡肉呢。”她说。

“什么？”这个病怏怏的女人突然提高了声调。

“噢，没什么，”波莉安娜赶紧道歉，“当然这并没有什么区别。只是南茜说给您带肉冻的时候您想要鸡肉，给您带鸡肉的时候您想要羊肉汤而已——但或许南茜记反了。”

病怏怏的女人费力地往上挪动，直到在床上能够直起身——这对她来说可不是一个平常的动作，但波莉安娜并不知情。

“好吧，鲁莽小姐，你是谁？”她问。

波莉安娜开心地笑起来。

“噢，我可不叫这个名字，斯诺夫人。为此我感到很高兴呢，这名字比‘赫夫齐芭’还要糟糕，对不对？我是波莉安娜·惠提尔，波莉·哈灵顿小姐的外甥女。现在我和她住在一起啦。所以今早我才会出现在这儿给您送牛蹄冻。”

刚讲这话的时候，病女人还饶有兴致地坐直了听，但一提到牛蹄冻，她又有气无力地倚在了枕头上。

“很好，谢谢你。当然，你的姨妈人很好，但今早我的胃口不是很好，想吃点羊肉——”她突然停了下来，马上换了一个话题，“昨晚上我一宿没睡——连眼皮都没眨一下。”

“噢，我的天哪，我希望我也这样，”波莉安娜叹了口气，把牛蹄冻放在了小台子上，然后舒服地坐在离斯诺夫人最近的椅子上，“睡觉浪费了太多的时间！你不觉得吗？”

“浪费时间——睡觉！”病女人大叫道。

“是啊，特别当您在‘生活’的时候。我们晚上不能‘生活’，真是太可惜了。”

女人再次直了直身子。

“啊，你真是一个不同寻常的孩子！”她大叫道，“去那儿！到窗户前把窗帘拉开，”她发出了一道指示，“我要看看你到底长什么样！”

波莉安娜站了起来，但是有点抱歉地笑了笑。

“噢，天哪！那样你就会看到我的雀斑了，对吗？”她叹了口气，走到了窗前，“——我刚觉得屋子里黑乎乎的，您看不见我，我还挺高兴的呢。看吧！现在您可看见啦——噢！”她兴奋地说完，转身回到床边，“您愿意看到我，我很高兴，因为这样的话，我也可以看到您了呀！他们可没告诉我您竟然这么漂亮！”

“我——漂亮！”女人苦涩地自嘲道。

“是啊，您不知道吗？”波莉安娜大叫。

“呃，不，我不知道。”斯诺夫人干巴巴地回答。她已经四十岁了，有十五年的时间她总忙于希望事与愿违，以至于没有太多时间去欣赏事物本来的面貌。

“噢，您的眼睛又大又黑，您的头发也很黑，而且还卷卷的，”波莉安娜叽叽喳喳说个不停，“我喜欢黑色的卷发。到了天堂，这可是我希望得到的东西之一。您脸颊上还有两小片红晕。啊，斯诺夫人，您真是太漂亮啦！我觉得您照镜子的时候应该知道呢。”

“镜子！”病女人打断道，又倚在了枕头上，“好吧，是的，有好些日子我没有站在镜子前面了——要是你像我一样天天不离床的话，你也不会照的！”

“是啊，当然不会，”波莉安娜同情地表示同意，“但等等——让我拿来给您看看。”她大叫道，蹦跳着跑到柜子前，取下一面小的手把镜。

还没走到床边，她又停了下来，仔细地打量着床上的病人。

“我想，要是您不介意的话，在您照镜子之前，我想先给你梳理一下头发。”她提议道，“我可以梳理您的头发吗？”

“噢，我——好吧，你想梳就梳吧，”斯诺夫人勉强同意了，“但你要知道这发型也撑不了多长时间的。”

“噢，谢谢您。我可喜欢给别人梳头发啦。”波莉安娜高兴地说道，然后小心翼翼地放下镜子，拿了把梳子，“今天咱们没法做太复杂的发型——我就快速简单地弄一下，让您看看您有多漂亮。改天我再过来把您的头发都放下来，然后好好地给您饬捯饬。”她一边大声说着，一边用柔软的手指摆弄女人额前的卷发。

五分钟的时间里，波莉安娜十分利索地收拾着斯诺夫人的头发。她熟练地把黏在一起的卷发梳蓬松，把脖子上皱巴巴的衣领整理好，又抖抖枕头让它更加蓬松，以使斯诺夫人的头能舒服地靠着。斯诺夫人虽然紧紧皱着眉，一直嘲笑整个过程，但却感到一阵近乎激动的兴奋。

“您瞧！”波莉安娜舒了一口气，迅速从旁边的花瓶里摘下一朵石竹花，插在斯诺夫人乌黑的头发里能营造出最佳效果的位置，“现在我想咱们可以照照镜子啦！”她胸有成竹地举起了镜子。

“哼！”斯诺夫人咕哝着，仔细地看着镜子，“比起粉色的石竹花，我更喜欢红色的。不过，它们等不到晚上就都会谢了，也没什么不同！”

“但我觉得花谢了您应该高兴才是啊，”波莉安娜笑答，“这样的话，您才能拥有更多的花啊。我就是喜欢您的头发像这样蓬蓬松松的，”她很满意地看着，“您觉得呢？”

“唔，也许吧。不过——我在枕头上蹭来蹭去，它可撑不了多长时间。”

“当然不能啦——但我一样很高兴呢，”波莉安娜开心地点点头，“因为这样的话我就可以再给你重新梳理了。不管怎样，我觉得您也应该为您的黑头发感到高兴啊——黑头发散在枕头上可显得比我这样的黄头发好看多了。”

“可能吧，但我从没在我的黑头发上花过心思——它很快就会变白的。”斯诺夫人烦躁地反驳说，但还是没有把镜子放下。

“噢，我喜欢黑头发！如果我的头发是黑的，那我会非常高兴的。”波莉安娜感叹道。

斯诺夫人放下镜子，被激怒了。

“不，你才不会——你又不是我。如果你像我这样天天待在床上，你才不会因为黑头发或其他什么东西高兴呢！”

波莉安娜眉头皱了起来，若有所思。

“好吧，是有点难——要那么做的话，对吧？”她自言自语。

“做什么？”

“对事情感到高兴啊。”

“对事情感到高兴——当你所有的日子都卧病在床的时候？那好吧，我觉得可以做到，”斯诺夫人讽刺地说，“如果你不这么认为的话，那就告诉我有什么好高兴的，就这样！”

让斯诺夫人感到吃惊的是，波莉安娜拍着手一跃而起。

“噢，太棒啦！这确实有点难——是不是？我现在得走了，但回家的路上我会一直想着的。或许下次我再来的时候就可以告诉您啦！再见啦！今天过得很愉快！再见！”她又喊了一声，然后蹦蹦跳跳地出了门。

“哼，决不会的！不过，她是什么意思啊？”斯诺夫人盯着她的背影突然说。过了一会儿，她转过头，拿起镜子，挑剔地看着镜中的自己。

“那小家伙梳头还真有两下子，竟然没有梳错，”她小声咕哝着，“不得不承认，我还真不知道自己如此好看呢。不过，这又有什么用呢？”她叹了口气，把镜子扔到床上，躺在枕头上烦躁地翻来覆去。

不一会儿，斯诺夫人的女儿米莉走了进来，镜子还放在床单上——不过已经被小心地藏起来了。

“啊，妈妈——窗帘被拉开了！”米莉大叫，又惊讶地发现母亲头上戴的石竹花。

“拉起来了又怎么样呢？”斯诺夫人呛了一句，“我虽然生病了，但也不用在黑暗中待一辈子吧，是吗？”

“噢，不，当然不是了，”米莉赶紧安慰道，又去取来药瓶，“我只是——您知道，我一直以来都想让您的房间进点光亮，但您一直不肯。”

斯诺夫人没有回答，她撩起睡衣上的蕾丝花边，烦躁地说：

“我觉得应该给我一件新睡衣——而不是羊肉汤！”

“噢——妈妈！”

米莉惊异地大叫道。就在她身后的抽屉里，放着两件新睡衣。好几个月来，米莉一直央求母亲穿上它们，但徒劳无功。





第九章　有关那位男士


波莉安娜再次遇到那位男士的时候，天正在下雨。但她跟他打招呼的时候脸上却带着明媚的笑容。

“今天天不大好啊，是吧？”她愉快地说，“不过，我还是很高兴不是天天下雨呢！”

这次，那位男士连嘟囔都没有，也没转头。波莉安娜觉得他一定是没有听见她说的话。第二次（恰好第二天就碰见他了），她又大声了一点。她觉得非常有必要这么做，因为那位男士依旧背着手，盯着地面，径直大步往前走——波莉安娜觉得太奇怪了。今天阳光那么灿烂，早上的空气又那么新鲜。她今天早上可有一个特殊的差事呢。

“您好！”她欢快地说，“今天可不像昨天那样呢，是吧？”

那位男士突然停下了脚步，脸上带着一丝愠怒。

“听着，小姑娘，咱们还是把这事一次性说明白了。”他开始发火了，“除了天气，我还有其他的事要考虑。我才不关心有没有太阳呢。”

波莉安娜却很高兴。

“是的，先生，我也觉得您不知道。所以我才得告诉您啊。”

“嗬，好吧——呃？你说什么？”他骤然停住，突然间明白了她的意思。

“我是说，所以我才得告诉您啊——这样您才能注意到——才能知道有阳光，以及所有其他的东西。我相信只要您停下来想想看，您就会很开心的。您看上去一点也不像琢磨过这事的样子。”

“呵，所有的——”男人突然说，做了一个奇怪的有气无力的手势。他又开始向前走，但是没走两步，又皱着眉头转过身。

“听着，你为什么不去跟和你差不多大的小孩说话呢？”

“我也想啊，先生，可是南茜说这附近没有啊。不过，我也不是很在意啦。我挺喜欢和年长的人说话，可以说更喜欢呢——因为我跟妇援会的人待习惯啦。”

“哼！妇援会，好吧！你是把我当作和她们一样的人了吗？”男士紧闭的嘴唇已经泛起了笑意，但严肃愠怒的表情还是压过了笑容。

波莉安娜开心地笑了。

“哦，不是，先生。您可跟她们一点都不像——当然您看起来也非常善良——或许比她们还要善良呢，”她赶紧礼貌地又加了一句，“您看，我肯定，您可比看上去善良的多呢！”

男士喉咙里发出一声奇怪的声音。

“好吧，所有的——”他又停住了，接着转身像之前那样大步离开了。

波莉安娜再次见到他的时候，他直勾勾地盯着她。不过波莉安娜却觉得这种奇怪的直视倒是让他看上去挺可爱的。

“下午好，”他有点生硬地跟她打招呼，“也许我该立刻说我知道今天阳光不错。”

“但您也不用告诉我啊，”波莉安娜高兴地点头说，“打我一看见您，就知道您已经知道啦。”

“噢，是吗，你看出来了？”

“是啊，先生，我在您眼睛里，还有您的笑容里就瞧出来啦。”

“哼！”他咕哝了一句，离开了。

从这之后，那个人总会跟波莉安娜说上几句，而且经常是他先开口，尽管常常只是一句“下午好”。但即便只是这样，也足以使南茜感到非常惊讶了。有一次她和波莉安娜恰好在一起，就看见了这事。

“天哪，波莉安娜小姐，”她喘着气说，“那个人是在跟您说话吗？”

“怎么啦，是啊，他现在都会跟我说话的。”波莉安娜微笑着说。

“‘他都会跟您说话’！我的天！您知道他——是——谁吗？”南茜问。

波莉安娜皱着眉摇了摇头。

“我觉得那天他肯定是忘记告诉我了。你知道，我介绍了自己，而他却没有做介绍。”

南茜睁大了眼睛。

“孩子，他可从来没跟任何人说过话，孩子——我猜他已经这样好多年了，除了像谈生意这种不得已的事儿。他是约翰·彭德尔顿，一个人住在彭德尔顿山上的大宅子里，也不请人给他做饭。他一天三顿都到山下的旅馆吃。据我所知，莎莉·迈娜，就那个餐厅负责招待他的服务员，说他几乎从不会说他想吃啥，大部分时候都得靠她自己琢磨。后来她知道了——只要是便宜的就行！不用说也知道了！”

波莉安娜同情地点了点头。

“我知道，穷的时候只能什么便宜买什么。爸爸和我经常不在家吃饭，大多数时候我们都会点豆子和鱼丸。我们经常说太喜欢豆子了——尤其是在有烤火鸡的地方，更是这么说，你知道的，要是吃烤火鸡的话得花六十美分呢。彭德尔顿先生也喜欢豆子吗？”

“喜欢豆子！喜不喜欢有啥关系？哎呀，波莉安娜小姐，他可不穷。他可有钱了，他爹给他留了好多钱呢。镇子里可没人能有他那么有钱。他要是想，都能吃钱呢，只不过他不知道罢啦！”

波莉安娜咯咯笑了起来。

“南茜，看你说的，就好像只要尝试去咀嚼，任何人都会吃钱一样，只是他们不知道怎么吃！”

“哈！我的意思是说他可有钱啦，”南茜耸耸肩，“但他一点都不舍得花，要攒着呢。”

“哦，是为了异教徒吗，”波莉安娜猜测道，“真是太伟大了！那是否定了自己，背起了十字架呢。爸爸告诉过我的。”

南茜张开了嘴，好像马上就要说出很气愤的话了，但当她的目光停留在波莉安娜高兴而虔诚的脸上，又把话咽了回去。

“哼！”她没反驳，又表现出了刚才的那种兴趣，继续说道，“不过说实话啊，波莉安娜小姐，他肯跟您说话，真是太奇怪了。他从不跟任何人说话，一个人住在那么豪华的漂亮大房子里。有的人说他有点疯，有的人说他就是有点脾气不好，还有的人说他的衣橱里有个‘骷髅’。”

“噢，南茜！”波莉安娜害怕地发抖，“他怎么能把这么可怕的东西放在家里呢？我觉得他应该把它扔掉！”

南茜笑起来。因为她知道波莉安娜是从字面意义上来理解“骷髅”一词的，但，她仍然没有去纠正波莉安娜的错误。

“每个人都说他很神秘，”她继续说，“有些年他一直在外边儿转悠，一去就去好久，总是去那些异教徒的国家——埃及、亚洲，还去过撒拉哈沙漠，您知道的。”

“噢，原来是个传教士。”波莉安娜点头说。

南茜笑得怪怪的。

“啊，我可没说，波莉安娜小姐。他回来以后就开始写书。他们说那些书怪里怪气的，都是关于从那些异教徒国家找到的小玩意儿。不过在这儿，他可不愿意多花一个子儿，除了吃饭。”

“当然不愿意了——如果他想把钱省下来给异教徒的话，”波莉安娜说，“但他是个很有趣的人呢，而且也很与众不同，就像斯诺夫人一样。只不过他是不同的与众不同。”

“啊哈，我觉得他是——相当与众不同。”南茜咯咯地笑着说。

“甭管怎样，他愿意跟我说话了，我比以前开心了好多。”波莉安娜满足地舒了口气。





第十章　给斯诺夫人的惊喜


波莉安娜第二次去看望斯诺夫人的时候，发现她跟之前一样，待在黑暗中。

“妈妈，波莉小姐家的小姑娘来了。”米莉疲倦地向母亲告知，然后留下波莉安娜独自陪伴病人。

“噢，是你吗？”床上传来一个倦怠的声音，“我记得你，我猜只要见你一面，没有人会把你忘了。我以为你昨天会来的。我希望你昨天来。”

“是吗？噢，那我很高兴今天离昨天不太久呢，”波莉安娜笑答，欢快地走进房间，小心翼翼地把篮子放在一张椅子上，“天哪！这也太黑了，我一点也看不见您呢！”她一边大叫，一边当机立断地走到窗前，一下子拉开了窗帘，“我想看看您是不是像我上次给您做的那样，把头发盘起来啦——噢，您没有！不过，没关系，我很高兴您没盘头发，因为或许一会儿您会让我来盘——不过现在，咱们先看看我给您带了些什么。”

斯诺夫人有点焦躁不安了。

“就好像看上去跟之前不大一样的话，尝起来也就不一样了似的！”她奚落道，但还是把目光落在了篮子上，“好吧，带了什么？”

“您猜猜看！您想要什么？”波莉安娜跳到篮子后面，兴奋地说。斯诺夫人皱了皱眉。

“唉，我什么也不想要，”她叹了口气，“因为它们吃起来味道都差不多！”

波莉安娜咯咯地笑起来。

“这次可不一样喔。猜猜看，如果您一定想要点什么的话，它会是什么？”

斯诺夫人开始犹豫了。她自己也没有意识到想要点什么，她一直以来都已经习惯了去寻求那些她没有的东西。因此，让她毫无准备地说出自己想要什么显然不大可能——除非她已经知道自己有些什么。但现在，很明显，她必须说点什么，那个非同寻常的小女孩还在等着呢。

“呃，好吧，我想要羊肉汤——”

“我已经准备啦！”波莉安娜大叫。

“但我并不想要羊肉汤，”斯诺夫人叹气道，终于知道想吃什么了，“我想要鸡肉！”

“噢，我也带了鸡肉！”波莉安娜笑出声来。

斯诺夫人吃惊极了。“你两个都带过来了？”她问道。

“是啊——还有牛蹄冻，”波莉安娜得意扬扬地说，“我把您可能想要的东西一次全都带来了，南茜跟我一起装的。哦，当然啦，每样都只有一点点——但加起来也不少了呢！您想吃鸡肉，真是让我太开心啦！”她满意地说，然后从篮子里拿出了三个小碗，“要知道，我一路上都在想——要是您说想吃牛肚啊，洋葱啊，或者其他那些我没有的东西该咋办呢！这可太丢人啦——我可没少费劲呢！”她开心地笑着说。

斯诺夫人没说话，心里好像一直在试图寻找她没有的东西。

“好啦！我把它们都放在这儿啦，”波莉安娜把三个碗放在桌子上排成一排，“您明天想要的羊肉汤也在这儿啦。今天感觉怎么样呀？”她很礼貌地问。

“很糟糕，谢谢，”斯诺夫人嘟囔着，心情又回到先前的低落状态，“早上本来想打个盹儿，但隔壁的内莉·希金斯开始了她的音乐课，琴声快把我弄疯了！整个上午都不消停——没一分钟是消停的！我真是不知道该怎么办了！”

波莉安娜理解地点点头。

“我知道，这太可怕了！怀特夫人——就我们那儿妇援会的一个人——曾经也有过这样的经历。那时她还患有风湿热呢，不能扭转身体。她说要是能转转身体也许就会好一些。您能转身吗？”

“我能——干什么？”

“扭动着转转身——这样的话，如果太受不了琴声，可以换换姿势。”

斯诺夫人愣了一会儿。

“呃，我当然可以转身了——在床上——哪儿都可以动。”她有点生气地回答道。

“啊，那您应该为此感到高兴的，不是吗？”波莉安娜点点头，“怀特夫人就没法这样。您要是有风湿热的话，就不能翻身了，那太可怕了。后来有一次她跟我说，要不是怀特先生妹妹的耳朵听不见的话，她估计会疯掉。”

“妹妹的——耳朵！你是什么意思？”

波莉安娜笑起来。

“好吧，我还没跟您讲过呢，我都忘了您不认识怀特夫人的。是这样的，怀特小姐是个聋子——很严重的那种。她到怀特夫人家来帮忙照看她，以及管管家。他们可花了好长一段时间跟她解释各种各样的事。后来，街对面钢琴的声音一响起，怀特夫人就特别高兴自己能听到，听多少遍都不烦，因为她忍不住想，要是像她小姑子那样，什么声音都听不见的话，是多可怕的一件事啊。您看，她也玩了那个游戏。我告诉她的。”

“游——戏？”

波莉安娜拍拍手。“对啦，我差点忘了，我已经想到了，斯诺夫人——您觉得什么能让您高兴？”

“高兴？这是什么意思？”

“啊，我告诉过您啊，我会做到的。您忘记了吗？您让我告诉您一些高兴的事——高兴，您明白的，您一定会有的，即便每天只是躺在这儿。”

“噢！”怀特夫人嘲笑地说，“这样啊，好吧，我记得。但我并不认为你会比我更急切吧。”

“噢，是的，那是当然，”波莉安娜点点头，得意地说，“我也找到啦，虽然有点难。不过越是难，乐子才越多呢。我承认，说真的，一下子我也想不到什么高兴的事，不过后来还是想出来啦。”

“是吗，真的吗？好吧，那是什么？”斯诺夫人颇有礼貌的声音中带着一丝嘲笑。

波莉安娜深深吸了口气。

“我觉得——您应该感到很开心——要知道其他的人并不像您一样——卧病在床呢。”她很动情地说。斯诺夫人瞪大了眼睛，怒气冲冲。

“是啊，真是这样的呢！”她打断了波莉安娜，很明显并不同意她的说法。

“现在我给您讲讲这个游戏，”波莉安娜很自信地提议道，“您肯定会觉得这个游戏很有趣——虽然有些难。但越是难越是好玩呢！您看，就是这样的。”她开始讲募捐桶，讲拐杖，讲没有收到的玩具娃娃。

故事刚一讲完，米莉就出现在了房门口。

“波莉安娜小姐，你的姨妈要你回去了，”她无精打采地说，“她打电话到街对面的哈洛家，说你有一些练习天黑前得完成，要你快点回去。”

波莉安娜很不情愿地站起身。

“好吧，”她叹了口气，“我得快点回去了。”突然她又笑了起来，“我想我得为此高兴呢，因为我有腿可以快点回去啊，对不对，斯诺夫人？”

斯诺夫人紧闭双眼，没有回答。但米莉却瞪大了眼睛，她惊讶地发现，有泪水正从母亲消瘦的脸颊上滑落。

“再见，”波莉安娜跑到门口，转头道别，“很抱歉这次没给您梳头——我本来是想梳来着。下次我再梳吧！”





七月一天天过去了。对于波莉安娜来说，每一天都过得很快乐。她常常愉快地跟姨妈说，自己是有多么的高兴。一般情况，姨妈都没心思理会，只是回答道：“很好，波莉安娜，你过得高兴，我当然很欣慰。但我认为这些日子你也应该收获不少吧——不然的话，我会觉得没有尽到责任。”

这种情况下，波莉安娜通常会用一个拥抱和亲吻来代替回答——虽然波莉小姐对于此种行为还很局促不安。但在一次缝纫课上，波莉安娜还是开口了。

“波莉姨妈，您觉得每天都过得很快乐还不够吗？”她充满期待地问。

“我就是这个意思，波莉安娜。”

“还得有——收获，对吗？”

“当然啦。”

“什么叫‘收获’呢？”

“呃，就是——就是得到一些益处——有益处，一些表现出来的东西，波莉安娜。你可真是个不同寻常的孩子。”

“难道开开心心不算是‘有益’吗？”波莉安娜有点着急了。

“当然不算。”

“噢，天哪！那我肯定您不会喜欢这个游戏，估计也肯定不会玩喽，波莉姨妈。”

“游戏？什么游戏？”

“呃，就是爸爸——”波莉安娜赶紧用手捂住了嘴，“没——什么。”她结结巴巴地说。波莉小姐皱起了眉。

“早上就到这儿吧，波莉安娜。”她简短地说了一句，缝纫课就结束了。

下午的时候，波莉安娜从阁楼房间一出来，就看见了姨妈正在楼梯上。

“啊，波莉姨妈，太棒啦！”她大喊道，“您来看我啦！快请进来。我喜欢和您在一起。”说完，她蹦蹦跳跳地又跑上楼，把房门大大地敞开。

波莉小姐并没打算去看她外甥女，只是想去阁楼东边窗户旁的香柏木箱里找一条白色的羊毛围巾。但现在，连她自己都难以置信，她没在阁楼上的香柏木箱旁，而是坐在波莉安娜小房间的一把直背椅上——自从波莉安娜来了以后，波莉小姐不止一次发现自己，就像现在这样，没去做自己本来想做的事，而是做了一些完全没有想到的、令人惊讶的事！

“我喜欢跟您在一起，”波莉安娜又说了一遍，欢快地蹦来跳去，好像在华丽的宫殿里一般，“特别是在我住进这间屋子以后，所有的都是我自己的呢。噢，当然啦，我以前也有自己的房间，但那只是租来的。租的房子连自己家房子的一半都比不上呢，是这样吧？这个房间就是我的啦，是吗？”

“呃，是——是的，波莉安娜。”波莉小姐低声说，心里纳闷自己怎么不马上站起来，去找那条围巾呢。

“当然啦，我现在很喜欢这间屋子呢，即使没有我想要的那种地毯、窗帘，还有画。”波莉安娜脸红地停住，马上转换了话题，因为波莉姨妈很严厉地打断了她。

“波莉安娜，你说什么？”

“没——没什么，波莉姨妈，真的没什么。我不是这个意思。”

“我看不是这样吧，”波莉姨妈冷冷地说，“你既然已经开口了，就说完吧。”

“但的确没什么事啊，我只是以为这儿会有漂亮的地毯，带花边的窗帘，还有其他的东西，您知道的。但，当然啦——”

“你只是以为！”波莉小姐严厉地打断了她的话。

波莉安娜脸更红了。

“我不应该这样的，波莉姨妈，”她道了歉，“估计这只是因为我一直都想得到它们，但却一直没有得到过。噢，我们在募捐桶里发现过两块地毯，但都很小，一块上面有墨水点，一块有破洞。至于画么，我们只发现了两幅。爸爸——我的意思是，好一点的那幅我们给卖了，另一幅坏掉了。当然啦，如果不是因为这些，我本不应该想要它们——就是那些漂亮东西。我也不应该在第一天穿过大厅的时候以为我的房间会有多么的漂亮。还有——还有——但是波莉姨妈，只过了一小会儿——我是说，就一小会儿——当我看到柜子上没有镜子的时候，我就又高兴起来了，因为这样的话我就看不见脸上的雀斑了呀。而且没有什么画能比得上我窗户外面的风景啦，您对我又这么好，我都——”

波莉小姐突然间站起来，脸红红的。

“好了，波莉安娜，”她硬邦邦地说，“你说得够多了。”

说罢，她很快地下了楼——但走到最后一个台阶的时候，她突然意识到了什么，又返回阁楼，去东边窗户旁的香柏木箱里找了一条白色的羊毛围巾。

不到一天的工夫，波莉小姐就果断地对南茜说：“南茜，今早去把波莉安娜小姐的东西搬到阁楼下面的房间。我决定让我的外甥女暂时住在那儿。”

“好的，小姐。”南茜大声地回答。

“噢，太棒了！”南茜自言自语。

一分钟后，南茜就开心地朝着波莉安娜大叫道：“您肯定不敢相信自己的耳朵，波莉安娜小姐。您要去楼下的房间住啦！真的——真的！”

波莉安娜脸色发白。

“你的意思是——噢，南茜，这不是真的——这是真的吗？！”

“我猜您会觉得这是真的，非常真，”南茜兴奋地预言道，她一边从衣柜里面抱出一大堆衣服，一边朝波莉安娜点点头，“她让我把这些东西拿到楼下去，所以我可得在她改变主意之前就把它们拿下去。”

波莉安娜并没有等南茜把话说完，立马三步并作两步地飞奔下楼。

她哐哐哐地撞开两扇门，撞倒一把椅子，最终抵达了她的目的地——波莉姨妈面前。

“噢，波莉姨妈，波莉姨妈，这是真的吗？啊，那屋子里所有的东西都有——有地毯，窗帘，还有三幅画——另外还有窗外的那幅，因为窗户朝向是一样的。噢，波莉姨妈！”

“很好，波莉安娜。我很满意你喜欢这个变化。如果你这么念念不忘这些东西，我也相信你能很好地爱惜它们。就这样。波莉安娜，请把椅子扶起来。还有，在过去半分钟之内你撞开了两扇门。”波莉小姐严厉地说，语气甚至比之前还重，因为出于一些不可名状的原因，她觉得自己快哭了——波莉小姐可不习惯掉眼泪的。

波莉安娜把椅子扶好。

“您说的没错，我知道，我撞开了门，”她很高兴地承认了自己的错误，“我刚刚去了那间屋子，我觉得您也应该撞开过门吧，如果——”波莉安娜停下来，兴致勃勃地瞄了一眼姨妈，“波莉姨妈，您有没有撞开过门呀？”

“我希望——没有过，波莉安娜！”波莉小姐惊讶极了。

“噢，波莉姨妈，那太遗憾啦！”波莉安娜同情地说。

“遗憾！”波莉姨妈重复了一遍，惊得一句话也说不出来。

“是啊，您看，如果您真的想摔门的话，您肯定就这么做了，但您并没有啊。这就是说您对什么事情都高兴不起来呢——当然也许您不愿这么做，但您是控制不了的。所以我很遗憾您对任何事情都不感到高兴！”

“波莉安娜！”女士喘着粗气，但是波莉安娜已经跑远啦，只传来阁楼楼梯上砰砰的关门声。波莉安娜已经去帮着南茜搬她的东西了。

波莉小姐坐在客厅里，感到很疑惑——但是，她当然也曾高兴过——为一些事情。





第十一章　吉米的到来


八月来了。八月里有一些令人惊讶的事情，还有一些变化——不过这些对于南茜来讲，并没有什么。因为自从波莉安娜来了以后，她一直在寻找惊奇和改变。

第一件事情就是，有只小猫出现了。

波莉安娜是在家附近的路上发现这只可怜巴巴喵喵叫的小猫的。她问过了所有的邻居，没有人说家里丢了猫。于是波莉安娜理所当然地立即把它带回了家。

“没有找到它的主人，我还挺高兴的呢，”她兴奋地向姨妈汇报，“因为我太想把它带回家啦。我喜欢小猫。我知道您也会很高兴收留它的。”

而当波莉小姐看到外甥女怀中那个被遗弃的、灰色的小可怜时，她不禁吓得浑身发抖。她一点都不喜欢猫，即便是漂亮健康又干净的猫。

“噢！波莉安娜！这小东西太脏了！我敢肯定它生病了，并且身上全是细菌和跳蚤。”

“我知道，可怜的小东西，”波莉安娜轻柔地说，温柔地注视着小猫充满恐惧的眼睛，“它还在发抖呢，它吓坏啦。您看，它还不知道我们会收留它呢。”

“不会的——也没有人认为我们会收留它。”波莉姨妈意味深长地强调说。

“噢，不是的，他们已经知道了，”波莉安娜完全误解了姨妈的意思，“我已经跟每个人都说了，如果我没找到它的主人的话，我们就会收留它。我知道您肯定会很高兴的——孤零零的小可怜！”

波莉小姐张了张嘴，却说不出话来，那种莫名的无助感又涌了上来。自从波莉安娜来了以后，这种感觉常常会有。

“当然啦，我知道，”波莉安娜充满感激地马上回应道，“您都收留了我，更不会让这只可怜的孤零零的小猫四处流浪吧。福特夫人问我您是否同意我收留它的时候，我也是这么说的。啊，您知道，我还有妇援会呢，但这只小猫可什么也没有。我知道您会理解那种感受的。”她开心地点点头，跑出了房间。

“但是，波莉安娜，波莉安娜，”波莉小姐反对道，“我没有——”但波莉安娜早已经跑去厨房了，还边跑边喊：

“南茜，南茜，快看这只可爱的小猫咪呀，波莉姨妈要跟我一起把它养大呢！”而害怕猫的波莉姨妈此时正坐在客厅里，沮丧地靠在椅子上，无力反驳。

第二天，又出现了一条小狗，它甚至或许比那只小猫更脏、更没人愿意要。而且波莉小姐再次目瞪口呆地发现，自己被塑造成了保护神和天使的样子——这是波莉安娜毫不犹豫想当然地给她封的。可是她怕狗比怕猫还严重啊——她发现跟之前一样，自己根本无力反驳。

直到不到一周的工夫里，波莉安娜又领回家一个衣衫褴褛的小男孩，自信满满地为他乞求同样的保护时，波莉姨妈才不得不开口了。事情是这样的。

一个令人愉快的星期四早晨，波莉安娜又去给斯诺夫人送牛蹄冻——她们现在已经成为最好的朋友了。她们的友谊开始于波莉安娜的第三次来访，也就是她告诉斯诺夫人高兴游戏的故事之后的那次。斯诺夫人现在也开始跟波莉安娜一起玩这个游戏了。当然了，她玩得还不是很好——因为很长时间以来她对所有的事情都不满意，所以一下子要对任何事都感到高兴不是那么容易。但是在波莉安娜快乐的指引和对她所犯错误快乐的嘲笑中，她进步很快。这天，让波莉安娜极为欢欣鼓舞的是，她竟然说自己很高兴看到波莉安娜带来的牛蹄冻，因为她正想要这个呢——她不知道米莉在门口的时候就已经告诉波莉安娜，牧师的妻子那天刚送了一大碗一样的牛蹄冻。

波莉安娜正想着这事的时候，突然看到了一个小男孩。

小男孩闷闷不乐地蜷缩在路边，心不在焉地削着一根短木棍。

“你好。”波莉安娜朝他露出温暖的微笑。

小男孩向上瞥了一眼，然后又立即把目光移开了。

“跟你自己问好吧。”他咕哝了一句。

波莉安娜笑起来。

“现在看起来，即便有一碗牛蹄冻，你也不会高兴的。”她咯咯地笑着，站到他面前。

男孩有些不安，惊讶地看了她一眼，又继续用那把又钝又破的刀片削起木棍来。

波莉安娜犹豫了一下，便在他身边的草地上安逸地坐了下来。尽管波莉安娜一直勇敢地宣称她已经“习惯”跟妇援会的人在一起了，而且“并不介意”，但她还是时常因为没有同龄的伙伴而叹息。因此，她下决心争取一下面前这个。

“我叫波莉安娜·惠提尔，”她愉快地自我介绍，“你叫什么名字啊？”

男孩又不安起来，甚至站起来就想走了，但他又坐了回来。

“吉米·比恩。”他咕哝道，语气中带着不礼貌的冷漠。

“好啦，这样我们就算认识啦。我很高兴你向我介绍了自己——有些人就不会的。我住在波莉·哈灵顿小姐家，你住哪儿？”

“没住哪儿。”

“没住哪儿！噢，怎么可能——每个人都有住的地方啊。”波莉安娜肯定地说。

“呃，我就没有——只是现在没有，我正在找一个新地儿住呢。”

“噢！那是哪儿？”

男孩轻蔑地瞄了她一眼。

“笨蛋！我不是正在找地儿么，要知道的话，还找什么！”

波莉安娜摇了摇头，这可不是个乖孩子。她可不喜欢被别人叫“笨蛋”。不过，他毕竟是——跟大人不一样的人。“那你在哪儿住呢——我是说以前？”她问。

“咳，你能不能别总缠着我问问题啊！”男孩不耐烦地叹了口气说。

“我不能不问啊，”波莉安娜平静地说，“不然的话我怎么知道关于你的事呢。如果你给我多讲点，我就少问点喽。”

男孩笑了两声，是那种尴尬的笑，并不是发自肺腑的笑。但他这次说话的时候，脸色比先前愉悦了一些。

“好吧——听好了！我是吉米·比恩，今年十岁，快十一岁了。我去年住到了孤儿院，但那地方小孩儿太多了，根本没我的地儿。我也不想再待在那儿了，所以我就跑出来了。我琢磨着去别地儿住去——但我还没找着呢。我想有个家——就那种普普通通的就行。家里面有妈妈，而不是舍监。有了家，才有亲人。我爸死了之后，我们家就没亲人了。所以我不就出来找地儿住了么。我已经去过四家了，但——他们都不要我——尽管我说了，我可以工作。就这些！你想知道的都在这儿啦！”男孩说最后两句话的声音有点断断续续的。

“啊，真是可怜！”波莉安娜同情地说，“没有一个人想要你吗？噢，天哪！我非常理解你的感受，因为自从——自从我的爸爸去世后，除了妇援会，也没有什么人和我在一起了，直到波莉姨妈说她可以——”波莉安娜突然停住，一个绝妙的主意油然而生。

“噢，我知道有个地方你可以去，”她大叫，“波莉姨妈会收留你的——我知道她一定会的！她不是都收留我了吗？当小毛球和小黄狗没有人爱，无家可归的时候，她不也收留了它们吗？——它们不过是小猫小狗啊。噢，快来，我知道波莉姨妈一定会收留你的！你不知道她有多好，多善良！”

吉米·比恩瘦小的脸上放出了光彩。

“真的吗？她现在就会吗？我可以工作，你看，我很有劲的！”说着，他露出了干瘦干瘦的小胳膊。

“当然啦，她一定会的！噢，我的波莉姨妈是世界上最善良的女士——自从我妈妈成为天堂的天使之后。她有房间的——很多很多的房间，”波莉安娜喋喋不休，拉着吉米的胳膊又蹦又跳，“她的房子巨大无比呢，只不过也许——”她有点不安地又补充了一下，继续往前赶路，“也许你可能不得不先睡在阁楼的房间里。我一开始也是这样的。但现在那里安上了纱窗，也就不那么热了，苍蝇也飞不进来，不会把脚上的细菌带进来。你知道这个吗？那真是太棒了！如果你乖的话，也许姨妈会让你读那本小册子——呃，我是说如果你不乖的话。你脸上也有雀斑——”她用审视的目光瞥了一眼，“所以你会很高兴发现房间里面是没有镜子的。窗外的风景比所有挂在墙上的画好看多了。所以，我肯定你一点也不会介意睡在阁楼上啦。”波莉安娜气喘吁吁地说个不停，直到发现必须得停下来喘口气了。

“我的天！”吉米·比恩急促不解地叫喊道。虽然他没怎么听懂波莉安娜的话，但却着实羡慕。他补充道：“我可从来不知道还有人会像你这样一句接一句说得这么溜，都没空儿问问题呢！”

波莉安娜大笑起来。

“哈哈，那你无论如何都应该感到高兴，”她说，“我讲话讲得多了，你就不用说啦！”

一到家，波莉安娜就径直把她的小伙伴领到了惊得目瞪口呆的姨妈面前。

“噢，波莉姨妈，”她得意地说，“快看这儿！我又有了比小毛球和小黄狗更棒的东西让你收留了。他是一个真正的活生生的小男孩。首先，他一点也不介意睡在阁楼，而且他说他会工作，但我估计他大部分的时间需要跟我一块玩。”

波莉小姐的脸红一阵白一阵。虽然她没太理解波莉安娜的话，但她觉得自己已经理解得足够多了。

“波莉安娜，你这是在干吗？这个脏兮兮的小男孩是谁？你是在哪里找到他的？”她严厉地问道。

这个“脏兮兮的小男孩”往后退了一步，朝门外望去。波莉安娜开心地笑了起来。

“好吧，我一下子忘了告诉您他叫什么啦！我跟那位男士一样糟糕呢。他看上去挺脏的，是吧？——我是说——跟小毛球和小黄狗来咱们家时一样的。但我保证他只要跟它们一样洗完澡，就干干净净的啦——噢，我差点又忘了——”她笑着停了一下，“这是吉米·比恩，波莉姨妈。”

“那么，他在这儿干什么？”

“噢，波莉姨妈，我刚刚告诉您啦！”波莉安娜的眼睛瞪得老大，“他来找您的啊。我把他带回家——这样的话，他就可以住在这儿啦。他想有个家，想有亲人在一起。我告诉他了，您对我，还有小毛球和小黄狗是多么的好。我知道您对他也会很好的，因为他要比小猫小狗强多啦。”

波莉小姐一屁股跌坐在椅子上，颤抖地用手抚摸着喉咙。之前那种无助感又一次涌上心头，将她牢牢控制。她明显挣扎了一下，突然间直起身子。

“好了，波莉安娜。这是至今为止你做得最荒唐的一件事。就好像流浪的猫和脏兮兮的狗还不够糟糕似的，你还得从街上弄回来个破破烂烂的小乞丐，谁——”

男孩突然打了个激灵，眼睛亮亮的，扬起了下巴。他迈开两条瘦巴巴的小腿，毫不畏惧地迈了两大步，走到波莉小姐面前。

“夫人，我不是乞丐，我没想从您那要点什么。我是来工作的，靠自己的手养活自己的。要不是这女孩儿非得让我来，告诉我您有多好多善良，说您会收留我，我才不会来您这老房子呢。就这回事儿！”说完，他转过身，带着有点可笑或者说可怜的尊严，昂首阔步地离开了房间。

“噢，波莉姨妈，”波莉安娜抽泣道，“为什么啊，我还以为您会很高兴让他留在这儿呢！我肯定，您会非常高兴的——”

波莉小姐没有说话，抬起手，做了个制止的动作。她的神经终于崩断了，男孩口里的“多好多善良”还在她耳边缭绕。她知道，那种曾经的无力感几乎又要占据她了。她用尽了所有的力量，汇成最后一丝意志力。

“波莉安娜！”她尖叫着，“你能不能别一直用那个‘高兴’了！从早到晚就是‘高兴’——‘高兴’——‘高兴’，弄得我都要疯了！”

波莉安娜惊讶得下巴都要掉下来了。

“啊，波莉姨妈，”她喘着气说，“我以为我高兴了，您也会高——噢！”她立马停住，用手捂住了嘴巴，跌跌撞撞地跑出了房间。

波莉安娜在男孩走到车道尽头之前追上了他。

“嘿！嘿！吉米·比恩，我想让你知道，我是多么——多么抱歉！”她气喘吁吁地说，一把抓住了男孩的手。

“没什么抱歉的！我不会怪你的，”男孩闷闷不乐地回答，“但我不是乞丐！”他抖擞了一下精神补充道。

“你当然不是啦！但你也不要责怪姨妈，”波莉安娜请求道，“或许是因为我没有把你介绍明白，我得承认没能详细地告诉她你的事情。她真的很好很善良——她一直都是这样的，但我可能没解释清楚。我多么希望能帮你找个住的地方啊！”

男孩耸了耸肩，侧过身去。

“没关系，我想我自己可以找到一个待的地儿。你知道的，我又不是要饭的。”

波莉安娜若有所思地皱皱眉。突然，她转过身，脸上放光。

“快来，我告诉你我要干什么！今天下午妇援会有个聚会。我听波莉姨妈说的。我会去告诉她们你的事。你知道，爸爸想要什么的时候——比如教化异教徒或者要地毯的时候，他总会这么做。”

男孩猛地转过身。

“哼，我不是异教徒，也不是新地毯。不过——妇援会是什么玩意儿？”

波莉安娜惊讶地盯着他，不知如何回答。

“噢，吉米·比恩，你到底是在哪儿长大的——竟然不知道妇援会是什么？”

“哦，好吧——你不告诉我就算了。”男孩嘟囔着，转过身，满不在乎地准备要走。

波莉安娜呼啦一下子跑到他身边。

“呃，就是——就是——噢，就是很多女士在一起，开会啊，缝缝补补啊，做做晚餐啊，捐捐钱啊什么的，还有就是——就是在一起聊聊天。妇援会就是这样的。她们都非常善良——反正我家那边大部分都是这样的。这儿的我还没有见过，但我觉得她们也应该都挺好。下午我就去跟她们说你的事。”

男孩又气冲冲地转过身。

“你够了没有！也许你觉得光一个女人叫我小乞丐还不够，还得一帮女人都这么叫我才满意，是吗！够了！”

“噢，但你用不着去啊，”波莉安娜很快地辩解道，“我当然可以独自一人去告诉她们啦。”

“你会吗？”

“当然了，这回我好好地说，”波莉安娜急忙解释，男孩脸上的表情很快温和了下来，“而且我知道，她们中的一些人肯定会很乐意给你一个家。”

“我会干活儿的——别忘了说这点。”男孩谨慎地补充道。

“当然不会忘，”波莉安娜开心地许诺，成功实现了自己的意图，“明天我就给你消息。”

“在哪里？”

“在路边吧——就是今天咱们见面的地方，斯诺夫人家附近。”

“好吧，明儿我会在那儿的。”男孩停顿了一下，又慢慢地说，“也许我最好还是回孤儿院过夜。我也没有其他地儿可去。还有——还有就是我是今天早上才离开那儿的。我偷溜出来的，没告诉他们我不打算回去了。不然的话，他们会假装我不回去了——虽然我觉得有时我不见了，他们也没觉得多担心。他们可跟家里人不一样，你知道的，他们才不会关心！”

“我知道，”波莉安娜点点头，眼睛里面全是理解，“但是我敢肯定，明天见你的时候，我会给你一个普普通通的家，还有真正关心你的亲人。再见喽！”她开心地叫着，转身回家了。

此刻，波莉小姐正站在客厅的窗户旁，看着两个孩子。她忧郁地望着男孩，直到他拐弯消失在路的尽头。她叹了口气，转过身，虚弱无力地上了楼——波莉小姐并不常常这么无精打采。她的耳边还回想着男孩那句充满嘲笑意味的“你又好又善良”。她的心里面莫名有些忧伤——好像失去了什么东西似的。





第十二章　在妇援会面前


妇援会聚会的那天中午，哈灵顿大宅的午餐时间沉默异常。波莉安娜确实有很多话想说，但都没能持续下去，主要是因为有四次她想说“高兴”而不得不马上中断了讲话，这让她感到很窘。第五次又出现这种情况的时候，波莉小姐疲倦地摇了摇头。

“得了，得了，孩子，你想说就说吧，”她叹了口气，“我宁愿让你说出来，也别憋在心里——如果它引起了这么多的无谓的关注的话。”

波莉安娜皱巴巴的小脸这才舒展开来。

“噢，谢谢您。恐怕这确实有点难——我的意思是不让我讲出这个词的话。您知道，我已经玩了很长时间了。”

“你已经——干什么了？”波莉姨妈问道。

“玩——这个游戏啊，您知道的，爸爸——”波莉安娜赶紧住口，为自己这么快又一次跨入禁区而脸红。

波莉姨妈皱了皱眉，什么也没说。剩下的午餐时间又是一阵沉默。

不久之后，当波莉安娜听见波莉姨妈打电话告诉牧师的妻子，自己有点头痛，就不去参加妇援会的聚会时，她并没有为此感到难过。当波莉姨妈上楼回到房间，关上门时，波莉安娜尽力想要为此事感到难过。但她实在忍不住感到高兴，因为下午当她在妇援会面前说吉米的事情时姨妈将不在场，她还记得姨妈叫吉米·比恩小乞丐，她可不想让波莉姨妈在妇援会面前也这么叫他。

波莉安娜知道妇援会的聚会定在下午两点，就在离家不到半英里的教堂旁边的小礼堂里。她盘算着要在三点前一点点的时候到那儿。

“希望她们都在那儿，”她自言自语道，“说不定没来的那个人就是想给吉米·比恩一个家的人呢。当然了，对妇援会而言，两点开始往往就意味着三点开始。”

波莉安娜轻轻地，又勇气十足地走上了小礼堂的楼梯，推开门，进入前厅。主房间里传出了一阵女性柔和的谈笑声。波莉安娜迟疑了一下，推开了里面的一扇门。

交谈声戛然而止。波莉安娜怯怯地往前挪了一小步，此时正是说话的好时机，但她感到了少有的害羞。毕竟，这些半生不熟的面孔对于她来说，可不是家乡熟悉的妇援会呢。

“您好，女士们，”她支支吾吾却谦逊有礼地问候道，“我是波莉安娜·惠提尔。我——我想也许有些人认识我，不管怎样，我也认识你们——但你们这样聚在一起我就不认识了。”

屋子里静得连银针落地的声音都能听到。有些女士已经认识了她们伙伴的这个非同寻常的外甥女，而几乎所有的人都听说过她，但这个时候却没人出来说点什么。

“我——我来这儿——是想跟大家说件事。”波莉安娜停了一会儿，结结巴巴地说，没意识到自己的口气像极了父亲往常的措辞。

人群里有一点点骚动。

“是——是你的姨妈让你来的吗，亲爱的？”牧师的妻子，福特夫人问道。

波莉安娜有点脸红。

“噢，不是的，我自己来的。您知道，我过去经常和妇援会待在一块儿。是妇援会——还有爸爸把我一起养大的。”

有人毫无顾忌地窃笑起来，牧师的妻子皱了皱眉。

“好吧，亲爱的，有什么事？”

“呃，是——是吉米·比恩，”波莉安娜叹口气说，“他除了孤儿院之外没有其他的家，孤儿院满了，他们不想要他了，呃，他自己是这么觉得的。所以他想另外找一个家。他想要一个那种普普通通的家，家里面有妈妈而不是舍监——就是亲人，会关心他的那种亲人。他现在十岁快十一岁了，我想也许您们中的一些人会愿意让他——和您住在一起。”

“那你怎么不想！”一声嘀咕打破了波莉安娜的话引起的沉寂。

波莉安娜焦急的目光扫过周围的面孔。

“噢，我忘了说了，他会工作。”她急忙补充道。

仍是一片沉默。接着，一两位女士开始冷冷地向她问问题。不一会儿，她们就都知道了事情的大概，开始激烈地讨论起来，但似乎那些声音听上去并不怎么愉悦。

波莉安娜越听越不安，她们说的一些话她没有听懂。但过了一会儿，她把这些话凑在一起，终于懂了。那就是，没有人愿意给吉米一个家，尽管每个人都觉得总会有人收留他，因为有几个家里没有生男孩，但确实没有人真正愿意收留他。然后她听到牧师的妻子小心翼翼地建议说，妇援会作为一个团体，或许可以把今年寄给远在印度的小男孩们的大笔钱花在身边这个小男孩的生活和教育上。

接着，好多女士开始讨论起来。有几个马上就提了意见，比之前的声音更大，更不愉快。她们的团体好像是因为给印度宗教团体提供资助而享誉盛名的。有的女士说，如果今年的资助不如往年多，她们会羞愧得要死。有的话波莉安娜目前还听不大懂，听上去就像是她们根本不在意钱被用来做了什么，只要钱的总数不与她们在某项特定报告中名列榜首的社会名声相悖就成——当然这根本不是她们所说的意思！真是太让人困惑了，而且不是很让人高兴。以至于最后，当波莉安娜发现自己终于置身于安静而甜美新鲜的户外空气中时，由衷地感到开心——只不过，她也非常难过，因为明天要告诉吉米·比恩妇援会的决定，这可不是一件容易的事。真让人伤心啊。妇援会宁可把所有的钱用来抚养印度小男孩，也不愿意拿一些钱出来抚养自己镇子上的小男孩，而这仅仅是为了得到一些“报道中的信誉”，这是那个高高的、戴眼镜的女士的说法。

“把钱寄给异教徒当然也不坏，我也没有不让她们寄啊，”波莉安娜步伐沉重，边走边叹气，“但她们表现得就好像眼皮底下的这个小男孩根本不值得她们考虑——只有离得很远的小男孩才值得似的。但我觉得，他们应该更想看着吉米·比恩长大——而不是仅仅只关心报道怎么写的！”





第十三章　彭德尔顿森林


波莉安娜离开小礼堂以后并没有马上回家，她转身去了彭德尔顿山庄。今天虽然算是“假日”（她把那些少有的没有缝纫课和烹饪课的日子都叫“假日”），但却是艰难的一天。波莉安娜觉得没有什么能比去静谧葱茏的彭德尔顿森林里走一走更让她觉得舒心一点的了。所以，她顶着头上似火的骄阳，一步步爬到了彭德尔顿的山顶。

“无论怎样，五点半之前我不必回家，”她自言自语道，“在森林里转转确实要好很多，虽然我得爬到那儿去才行。”

波莉安娜凭着经验判断，彭德尔顿森林肯定会是个美丽的地方。而且，今天那儿看上去比往常还要美丽。但她的心里还是对明天要告诉吉米·比恩的事情感到沮丧。

“真想让她们都到这上面来——让那些叽叽喳喳的女士们都来。”波莉安娜一边感叹，一边抬眼望了望阳光照耀的绿色树梢间隙里瓦蓝瓦蓝的天空。“要是她们来这儿的话，肯定会改变主意收留吉米·比恩做自己的孩子的。”她对这一看法非常确信，但就连她自己也找不到这么说的理由。

突然，波莉安娜抬起头，竖起耳朵，仔细聆听。远处有狗在吠。不一会儿，一条小狗就冲到她面前，冲她狂吠不止。

“你好啊，狗狗——你好！”波莉安娜朝小狗打了个响指，满心期待地望着它跑来时的小径。她肯定自己以前见过这条狗，那时它正和那位男士，也就是约翰·彭德尔顿先生在一起。她正瞧着，期待着能看到他。波莉安娜充满渴望地望了几分钟，但彭德尔顿先生并没有出现，她便又把注意力放在了小狗的身上。

波莉安娜能够看出来，小狗的行动很奇怪。它一直在不停地叫——那种短促的、尖锐的叫声，好像在发出警示。它在前面的小路上不停地跑前跑后。当她们来到一条小路旁，小狗就朝前飞奔过去，但马上又跑回来，呜呜地叫着。

“嚯！那不是回家的路啊。”波莉安娜仍然站在主路上笑着说。

小狗看上去快要疯了。它不停地在波莉安娜和那条小路之间跑来跑去，乞求似的呜呜叫着。它棕色的小身体发出的每一个颤抖，棕色的眼睛里发出的每一个乞求的目光都是强烈的哀求——这哀求是如此的强烈，以至于波莉安娜最终得以明白，并立马转身跟上了它。

小狗在前面疯狂地奔跑。很快，波莉安娜就知道了事情的起因：一个人正一动不动地躺在离路边几码远的陡坡下，身下是一堆乱石。

波莉安娜啪咔一声踩断了一根小树枝，那个人转过了头。波莉安娜大叫一声，冲到他身边。

“彭德尔顿先生！您受伤了吗？”

“受伤？噢，没有啊！我就是在阳光下小憩一会儿，”他生气地说，“听着，你知道什么？你能做什么？你有感觉到什么吗？”

波莉安娜稍稍吸了口气，但——根据她的习惯——她一个接一个地从字面意义上回答了这些问题。

“好吧，彭德尔顿先生，我——我知道的不多，我也做不了什么大事，但妇援会中大部分人，除了罗森夫人，都说我有很好的感知能力呢。有一天我听见她们这么说的——虽然她们并不知道我听见了。”

那人冷笑了一声。

“你看，你看，孩子，我诚心请求你原谅，都怪我这条讨厌的腿。现在听好了，”他停顿了一下，有点困难地用手从裤兜里掏出一串钥匙，用拇指和食指捏起其中一把，继续说道，“径直穿过这条小路，走上大约五分钟，就能到达我的家。你用这把钥匙打开马车门道下面的边门。你知道什么是马车门道吗？”

“噢，知道，先生。姨妈的马车门道上面有一间日光浴室。我在那顶上睡过呢——但没睡着，您知道，他们发现我了。”

“呃？噢！很好，你进了房间，一直往前走，穿过门厅还有大厅，走到最里面的房门口。在房间中部那张又大又平的写字桌上有一部电话。你知道怎么用电话吗？”

“噢，知道的，先生！有次波莉姨妈——”

“现在别再提你姨妈了！”那人生气地打断道，试着挪动了一下身体，“在那附近你将找到一张卡片，——它可能挂在旁边的钩子上，也可能没有。在卡片上找到托马斯·奇尔顿医生的电话号码。我想，你应该知道电话号码卡片吧，只要你看到一张的话。”

“噢，是的，先生！我很喜欢波莉姨妈的电话卡册，那上面有好多奇怪的名字呢，还有——”

“告诉奇尔顿医生，就说约翰·彭德尔顿在彭德尔顿森林的伊格尔小山崖下摔断了腿，让他带上担架，再叫上两个人立马赶过来。其余的他知道该怎么办。告诉他沿着房子那边的小路赶过来。”

“摔断了腿？噢，彭德尔顿先生，这太可怕了！”波莉安娜颤抖着说，“但我很高兴我来了，我能不能——”

“是的，你能——但很显然你不会这样做的！你能不能不要再说了，去做我让你做的事？”男人虚弱地呻吟道。波莉安娜只能小声抽泣着离开了。

她现在可没工夫停下来再去看阳光照耀的树梢上那蓝蓝的天了，她急匆匆地向前赶路，眼睛直直地盯着地面，以确保不被小树枝或石子绊倒。

不一会儿，她就看见了那栋房子。她以前也曾经看到过，不过不像现在离得这么近罢了。这座由无数灰色石头堆积建造而成，带有柱廊和壮观的入口的巨型建筑，几乎把波莉安娜吓住了。她停了一会儿，穿过无人打理的大片草坪，绕过房子来到了马车门道下面。她紧握钥匙的手指有些僵硬，花了很大工夫才转动了门闩。终于，雕刻精美的大门缓缓打开了。

波莉安娜屏住了呼吸。尽管她很着急，但还是停了一会儿，战战兢兢地透过门廊望了一眼宽敞昏暗的大厅。她心神不定，知道这就是约翰·彭德尔顿的房子——那所神秘的房子。这房子除了主人还没人进来过呢，里面的某个地方藏着——骷髅架。而她——波莉安娜，将要独自进到这些可怕的房间里，还要给医生打电话告诉他房子的主人正躺在——

波莉安娜发出一小声惊呼，既没左顾也没右盼，径直飞奔穿过大厅，打开了尽头的房门。

这是一间宽敞又昏暗的房间，装饰着一些同大厅里一样的深色木制品和帷幔。阳光透过西边的窗户，打在了地板上投射出一道长长的金光，打在了壁炉生锈的铜铁架上散发着淡淡微光，也打在了房间中部的巨大书桌上那部镀镍电话机上。波莉安娜踮着脚尖快速来到桌旁。

电话卡册没有挂在钩子上，而是掉到了地板上，不过波莉安娜还是找到了它。她用颤抖的食指翻到大写字母C的一栏，找到了奇尔顿的名字，很快联系上了电话线另一端的奇尔顿医生。她哆嗦着描述了彭德尔顿先生的情况，并且回答了医生一些重要而简短的问题。做完这些，她放下电话听筒，放松地长长舒了口气。

波莉安娜随意向周围瞥了一眼，映入眼帘的是一片混乱的景象，深红色的窗帘、排满书的墙壁、满是垃圾的地板、乱七八糟的书桌，还有数不清的关着的门（也许就在某一扇门后面藏着一具骷髅）。到处都是灰尘，除了灰尘，还是灰尘。她飞奔着穿过大厅，冲出了仍然半开着的浮雕大门。

即便对于受伤的彭德尔顿先生来说，波莉安娜返回树林，回到他身边的速度也快得实在令人难以置信。

“好吧，遇到什么麻烦了？你没能进去吗？”他问。

波莉安娜睁大了眼睛。

“噢，我当然进去啦，”她回答说，“说得好像我没进去就回来了似的！医生和其他的人还有担架会尽快赶到这儿的。他说他知道您的位置，所以我就没有留在那儿领他过来。我想和您待在一起。”

“是吗？”男人冷冷地笑道，“好吧，那我可不能说我称赞你的品位。我觉你应该找一些更讨人喜欢的伙伴。”

“您的意思说——因为您很——爱生气？”

“谢谢你的直言不讳。是的。”

波莉安娜轻轻笑了起来。

“但您只是表面看上去坏脾气——内心可一点也不是！”

“是吗！你怎么知道的？”男人问，他试着不挪动身体的其他部位，只把头的位置改变一下。

“噢，从很多方面都能看出来。你看——譬如——您和小狗待在一起的样子，”她指着男人放在小狗圆圆的头上那细长的手指，“小狗和小猫其实比人类更懂人的内心呢，是不是很可笑？来，我来托着您的头吧。”她突然说。

姿势的改变让彭德尔顿先生的脸抽搐了几下，又轻轻呻吟了一声。不过，最终他发现波莉安娜的膝盖枕起来要比之前的乱石堆舒服多了。

“呃，这——好多了。”他气若游丝地嘟囔了一句。

有好长一段时间他都没有说话。波莉安娜注视着他的脸，想知道他是否睡着了。不过她觉得应该是没有睡着。他嘴唇紧闭，像是在强忍着不发出痛苦的呻吟声。看到他高大强壮的身体如此无助地躺在这儿，波莉安娜几乎快要哭出声来了。他的一只手拳头紧握，一动不动地伸在外面。另一只手，软塌塌地张着，搭在小狗的头上。小狗眼巴巴地望着主人的脸，也一动不动。

时间一分一秒地过去了。太阳一点点西落，树影越来越暗。波莉安娜始终一动不动地坐着，大气都不敢出。一只小鸟毫无顾忌地飞落在她触手可及的地方，一只小松鼠在树枝上摇着毛茸茸的大尾巴，在她眼皮底下晃来晃去——它亮晶晶的小眼睛盯着趴在那儿一动不动的小狗。

终于，小狗的耳朵竖起来，轻轻地呜咽了两声，然后发出了尖锐的短叫。接着，波莉安娜就听见了一些声音。很快，三个男人抬着担架和一些其他的东西赶来了。

他们中个子最高的那位——胡子刮得很干净，眼神很温和的那位，神采奕奕地走过来。波莉安娜一眼就知道，他就是“奇尔顿医生”。

“噢，小姑娘，你是在扮演小护士吗？”

“噢，不，先生，”波莉安娜微笑道，“我只是托着他的头——我没有给他一点点药，但我很高兴我在这儿。”

“我也很高兴。”医生点点头，然后开始全神贯注地查看受伤的彭德尔顿先生。





第十四章　牛蹄冻事件


由于约翰·彭德尔顿先生的缘故，波莉安娜晚上回去吃饭的时间稍晚了一些，但还好没人责备她。

南茜在门口遇到了她。

“哎呀，我可算把你给盼回来了！”她明显松了一口气说，“都六点半啦！”

“我知道啦，”波莉安娜急切地承认，“但我可不应该受到责备——真的不应该。而且我觉得波莉姨妈也会这么说的。”

“她可没这机会，”南茜心满意足地回答，“她走啦。”

“走了？”波莉安娜喘息着，“你的意思不会是我把她气走的吧？”此时波莉安娜脑海里浮现出早上那些令她懊悔的回忆，比如不被接受的吉米、小猫、小狗、不受欢迎的“高兴”，还有被禁止提及但她却经常脱口而出的“爸爸”，“噢，不是我把她气走的吧？”

“才不是你的事儿呢，”南茜奚落道，“她的表姐突然在波士顿去世了，她得过去看看。今天下午你走后她收到的电报，三天之后才会回来。现在，我猜咱俩应该很高兴。整个房子都是咱们的啦，就你和我，就咱俩！”

波莉安娜惊呆了。

“高兴！噢，南茜，在举办葬礼的时候高兴？”

“噢，我又不是因为葬礼高兴，波莉安娜小姐。是——”南茜突然止住，狡黠地转了一下眼珠，“噢，波莉安娜小姐，好像是你教给我玩的这个游戏吧。”她一本正经地责备道。

波莉安娜皱起眉头，焦虑万分。

“我做不到，南茜，”她边摇头边说，“有一些事情是没有办法被拿来玩这个游戏的——我敢肯定葬礼就是其中之一。葬礼可没有什么值得高兴的。”

南茜咯咯地笑起来。

“咱们可以因为不是自己的葬礼而感到高兴啊。”她假装严肃地说。但波莉安娜没有听到这句话。她开始讲述今天的遭遇，听得南茜张大了嘴巴。

第二天下午，在先前约好的地点，波莉安娜见到了吉米。当然，不出所料，吉米对妇援会宁愿救助印度小男孩而不是自己的做法表现出了极大的失望。

“好吧，也许这就是命，”他叹了口气，“你不知道的事情总是比知道的事情好得多。就好像你永远都觉得别人盘子里的土豆是最大的一样。但我还是希望在遥远的地方有那么一个人也是这么看我的。如果印度有人想收留我，那不是很棒吗？”

波莉安娜拍起手掌。

“哇，当然啦！就是这样，吉米！我要给我家乡的妇援会写信，告诉她们关于你的事。她们没有远在印度，只是在西部——但那也同样很远呢。要是你和我一样走了那么远的路来这儿，我相信你也会这么认为的。”

吉米的眼睛一下子亮了起来。

“你觉得她们会——真的会——收留我吗？”他问。

“她们当然会啦！她们不是抚养了印度小男孩吗？那么，这次她们就可以把你当成印度小男孩来养啊。我觉得你对她们来说已经远到足以写进报告里啦。你等着，我这就写信给她们。我会给怀特夫人写信，不，我要写给琼斯夫人。虽然怀特夫人有很多钱，但琼斯夫人出手最大方——这很有意思对不——只要你琢磨一下的话。但我相信妇援会有人收留你的。”

“好吧——但别忘了说我会干活儿养活自己。”吉米打断道，“我可不是要饭的，一码儿是一码儿。我觉得即便对于妇援会来说也是这样。”他犹豫了一下，又说，“我觉得我最好还是待在原来的地方等你的信儿吧。”

“当然啦，”波莉安娜郑重地点点头，“这样的话，我就知道去哪儿找你了。她们会收留你的——我肯定你离她们的距离足够远了。波莉姨妈不是也收养了——嘿！”她突然停下来问，“你觉得我是不是波莉姨妈从印度收养的小女孩啊？”

“哈，要是你不是世界上最奇怪的小孩儿的话。”吉米咧嘴大笑，转身走了。

大约一个星期后的早晨，波莉安娜才向姨妈提起彭德尔顿森林里的事。

“波莉姨妈，您会很介意我把这周给斯诺夫人的牛蹄冻送给别人吗？我肯定斯诺夫人不会介意的——就这一次。”

“我的老天，波莉安娜，你想干什么？”姨妈叹了一口气，“你真是我见过的不同寻常的孩子！”

波莉安娜不安地皱了一下眉。

“波莉姨妈，什么叫不同寻常？如果一个人不同寻常的话，就说明他不平凡，对吗？”

“当然了。”

“噢，那好吧。我很高兴自己不同寻常。”波莉安娜叹了口气，眉头舒展开来，“您知道，怀特夫人就经常说罗森夫人是个平凡的女人——她一点都不喜欢罗森夫人。她们经常吵架——我的意思是说，爸爸——噢，我是说，我们总是要在她俩身上花比其他人更多的时间来调解。”波莉安娜不断纠正自己的话。因为她说到教会的争吵就得说起爸爸过去的要求，但一提到爸爸，又得顾及姨妈现在的要求。真是让人喘不过气来。

“好了，好了，没关系，”波莉姨妈不耐烦地打断道，“你爱怎么说就怎么说吧，波莉安娜，不论我们说什么，你都会说到妇援会！”

“是的啊，”波莉安娜开心地微笑道，“我的确是这样的呢。是她们把我养大的呢，您是知道的呀！还有——”

“好了，波莉安娜，”姨妈冷冷地打断她，“现在来说说，牛蹄冻是怎么回事？”

“没事，波莉姨妈，真的。我肯定您也会觉得没事的。您让我给斯诺夫人送牛蹄冻，所以我觉得您也会给他的——就这一次。您看，腿摔坏了又不是——又不是一辈子残疾，所以给他送牛蹄冻只是一两次，剩下的都可以送给斯诺夫人。

“给他？他？‘腿摔坏了’？你在说什么呢，波莉安娜？”

波莉安娜睁大了眼睛，随即又放松下来。

“噢，我忘记了。我想您还不知道吧。这是在您离开的时候发生的事。您知道，就是您离开的那天，我在森林里找到他的。我去他家打开门，打电话给医生还有其他的人，我还托着他的头什么的。后来我就离开了，就没有再见着他啦。但南茜这周给斯诺夫人做了牛蹄冻，我就想，如果这次拿些牛蹄冻给他的话，那该多好啊。波莉姨妈，我可以拿去吗？”

“好吧，好吧，我想是可以的，”波莉小姐不耐烦地勉强同意了，“你说的到底是谁？”

“是那位男士，我是说，约翰·彭德尔顿先生。”

波莉小姐几乎从椅子上弹起来。

“约翰·彭德尔顿！”

“是的，是南茜告诉我他的名字的。或许您也认识他？”

波莉小姐没有回答，反问道：“你认识他？”

波莉安娜点点头。

“噢，是的啊。他总是跟人说话和微笑——我是说现在。他只是外表看上去脾气比较坏罢了。我去拿牛蹄冻啦。刚才我进来的时候，南茜已经快装好了。”波莉安娜说完，准备离开房间。

“等等，波莉安娜！”波莉小姐的声音突然变得严厉起来，“我改变主意了。我还是要把牛蹄冻送给斯诺夫人——就像往常一样。就这样，你可以走了。”

波莉安娜脸上充满了失落的表情。

“噢，波莉姨妈，她以后还会有的。她一直生着病，而且也一直有人送东西给她，而他只是摔坏了腿，腿不会一直这样的——我是说摔坏的腿不会一直这样。离上次我见到他已经一个星期了。”

“是的，我记起来了。我听说约翰·彭德尔顿先生遭遇了不幸，”波莉小姐说，语气有点生硬，“但——我不想把牛蹄冻送给约翰·彭德尔顿，波莉安娜。”

“我知道，他脾气不大好——但那只是外表看起来，”波莉安娜失望地说，“所以，我想您应该不喜欢他吧。但我不会说是您送给他的，我会说是我拿的。我很高兴去给他送牛蹄冻。”

波莉小姐又开始摇头。突然间，她停下来，用异常平静的声音问道：

“波莉安娜，那他知道你——是谁吗？”

小姑娘叹了口气。

“我想应该不知道吧。我有一回告诉了他我的名字，但他还从没有叫过我——从没有呢。”

“他知道你住哪儿吗？”

“噢，不知道。我从没告诉过他。”

“那么就是说，他不知道你是我的——外甥女？”

“我想他是不知道的。”

一片沉默。波莉小姐一直盯着波莉安娜，但眼睛里面好像又没有看着她。小女孩不耐烦地左右交替着脚站着，唉声叹气。波莉小姐突然站了起来。

“很好，波莉安娜，”她终于开口了，还是那种奇怪的语气，一点都不像她自己的声音，“你可以——你可以把牛蹄冻作为你的礼物送给彭德尔顿先生。但记住：不是我送的。一定不能让他认为是我送的！”

“是的——噢不会的——谢谢您，波莉姨妈。”波莉安娜一阵狂喜，飞奔出了门。





第十五章　奇尔顿医生


波莉安娜第二次来到约翰·彭德尔顿先生的住宅时，那座由巨大的灰色石头堆积而成的建筑物看上去与先前大不相同。窗户敞开着，一个老妇人正在后院晾衣服，医生的马车就停在马车门道的下面。

和上次一样，波莉安娜来到了侧门，不过这次她按响了门铃——今天她的手指不像上次那样因为紧握钥匙而僵硬。

一只模样熟悉的小狗跳上台阶来欢迎她，但过了一小会儿，那个晾衣服的妇人才来给她开了门。

“打扰了，我给彭德尔顿先生带了一些牛蹄冻。”波莉安娜微笑着说。

“谢谢你。”妇人接过小女孩手中的碗，问道，“我可以问是谁送的吗？是牛蹄冻吗？”

就在这个时候，医生来到大厅，听到了妇人的话，看到了一脸失望的波莉安娜。他连忙走上前来。

“啊！是牛蹄冻？”他亲切地问，“那可太好啦！或许你愿意见见我们的病人，嗯？”

“噢，是的，先生。”波莉安娜一脸笑容。妇人看到医生点了头，马上领着波莉安娜走进大厅，尽管她的脸上带着不可思议的表情。

一个年轻人（从附近城市请来的训练有素的护工）站在医生身后，发出一声惊呼：“可是，先生，彭德尔顿先生不是不许探望——任何人都不许吗？”

“噢，是的，”医生平静地点点头，“但现在听我的。我要冒这个险。”他故作神秘地说：“你不知道啊，这个小女孩无论何时都比一瓶六夸脱的补药还要见效。如果今天下午有什么东西或什么人能让彭德尔顿不再发牢骚的话，那就是她啦。这就是我让她进来的原因。”

“她到底是谁啊？”

医生犹豫了一会儿，说：

“她是我们最出名的一位居民的外甥女。她的名字叫作波莉安娜·惠提尔。我——我跟这位小姐的私人交往现在还不是很深，但是我的很多病人都跟她很熟——我很感谢她！”

护工笑了起来。

“这样啊！那她这个药效如此神奇的补药有哪些特殊的成分呢？”

医生摇了摇头。

“我也不知道。我所能发现的就是一种对已经发生或者将要发生事情的势不可当的、不可遏制的愉悦心情。至少，总是有人不断地向我重复她那些古怪的话语。在我看来，那些话主要的意思就是‘凡事都要高兴’。所有的都是这样，”说着，他走到门廊，露出一丝奇异的微笑，补充道，“我希望我能把她当处方一样——把她买下来——就像买一盒药一样——尽管如果世界上有足够多和她一样的人，你我这样靠看护和行医来赚取钱财的人，就只得去街上卖丝带或者挖地沟了。”说完他大笑起来，然后拿起缰绳，上了马车。

与此同时，按照医生的吩咐，波莉安娜被护送到了约翰·彭德尔顿的房间。

她经过大厅尽头的大书房时，尽管步履匆匆，但还是一眼就看出了书房的巨大变化。摆放书的墙和深红色的窗帘还是老样子，但地板上没有了垃圾，书桌上也整整齐齐，灰尘也看不见了。电话卡册挂在该挂的地方，黄铜铁架也擦得十分光亮。有一扇神秘的门开着，妇人正领着波莉安娜向这扇门走去。不一会儿，波莉安娜就发现自己走进了一间非常豪华的卧房，她听到妇人战战兢兢地说：

“打扰了，先生，有——有一个小女孩儿拿了一些肉冻给您。医生让我——把她领进来。”

下一刻，波莉安娜就发现房间里只剩下自己和一个平躺在床上的怒气冲冲的人了。

“够了，我不是说过——”一个生气的声音响起。波莉安娜向前走到窗边，“噢，是你啊！”声音稍稍柔和了些。

“是啊，先生，”波莉安娜微笑道，“噢，我太高兴了，他们居然让我进来啦！要知道，一开始的时候，那位女士把我的牛蹄冻接了过去，我好怕没法进来看您啊。后来医生出来了，说我可以进来。他真是个大好人啊，是不是？”

男人的嘴角向上翘起，露出一抹微笑，可嘴里却只是“哼”了一声。“我给您带了一些肉冻，”波莉安娜继续说，“是牛蹄的哦。我希望您能喜欢。”她的声音里有上扬的音调。

“我可从来不吃这个。”男人脸上的微笑转瞬即逝，愤怒又爬了上来。

仅仅是一刹那，波莉安娜的表情很是失望，但当她把牛蹄冻放下的时候，失望已经一扫而空。

“您从来都不吃吗？好吧，如果你没有吃过，怎么知道不喜欢吃呢？不管怎么样，您没吃过牛蹄冻，我还是很高兴的。现在，如果您知道——”

“好了，好了，有件事情我知道得很清楚，那就是我此时此刻躺在床上，我只能躺在这儿——恐怕一直要到世界末日。”

波莉安娜惊讶极了。

“噢，不！不会到世界末日的。天使加百利会吹响他的号角，除非它来得比我们想的还要快——噢，这是真的，我知道《圣经》上说他来得比我们想的还要快，但我想不会的——当然，我是相信《圣经》的。我的意思是，我不觉得他会快到现在就来，还有——”

约翰·彭德尔顿突然大声笑起来。护工恰好正要走进来，一听到这笑声，又赶紧悄悄地出去了。他就像一个诚惶诚恐的厨师，一看见有冷气要侵袭一块半成品蛋糕的危险，就急急忙忙把烤箱门关上了。

“你是不是有点犯晕啊？”约翰·彭德尔顿对波莉安娜说。

小姑娘笑了起来。

“可能吧。但我的意思是，腿不会一直这样的——我是说摔坏的腿，不会像斯诺夫人那样终身残疾。您的腿在世界末日到来前就会好起来的。我想您应该为此感到开心。”

“噢，是的。”男人冷冷地说。

“而且您只摔坏了一条腿，您应该为不是两条腿都摔坏了而高兴啊。”波莉安娜对她的任务很热心。

“当然啦！这太幸运了。”男人扬了扬眉毛，不屑地说，“如果从这个角度来看的话，我应该为我不是蜈蚣，没有摔断五十条腿而感到高兴！”

波莉安娜咯咯地笑起来。

“噢，那可最好不过啦！”她叽叽喳喳起来，“我知道蜈蚣是什么，它们有很多条腿。而且您也应该高兴，因为——”

“噢，当然，”男人严厉地打断道，原先痛苦的声音又回来了，“我也应该为其他的事情感到高兴吧——护工、医生还有厨房里那个糊里糊涂的女人。”

“啊，好吧，先生——想想如果您没有他们的话，情况将会有多么糟糕！”

“什么，我——嗯？”彭德尔顿厉声问。

“噢，我是说，请想想如果您没有他们的话，那将会是多么糟糕啊——您只能像这样躺在这儿！”

“就好像这还没有到最糟糕的地步似的，”男人恼火地反驳道，“就因为我像这样躺在这儿，你还希望我说我很高兴，因为一个愚蠢的女人弄乱了整个房子，并称之为‘归置归置’，一个男人在一旁教唆她这样做，并称之为‘护理’，更别提那个夹在他们中间的医生了——他们这些人，还指望着我给他们付酬劳，而且还是相当丰厚的酬劳！”

波莉安娜同情地皱着眉。

“是的，我知道。这确实十分糟糕——关于那些钱——从那时您一直攒着。”

“从那时——呃？”

“存着这些钱——只买豆子还有鱼丸。那么，你喜欢豆子吗？——还是说，您更喜欢火鸡，只是因为六十美分的缘故所以说自己喜欢豆子？”

“看这里，孩子，你到底在说些什么？”

波莉安娜灿烂地笑起来。

“说您的钱啊，您知道的——克制自己，把钱存下来给异教徒。看，我发现这事情了哦。啊，彭德尔顿先生，这也是我找到的您内心一点也不冷酷的证据之一呢。南茜告诉我的。”

男人惊得下巴都要掉下来了。

“南茜告诉你我存钱是为了——噢，好吧，我能问问南茜是谁吗？”

“我们的南茜，她在波莉姨妈家干活。”

“波莉姨妈！呃，谁是波莉姨妈？”

“是波莉·哈灵顿小姐啊。我和她住在一起。”

男人突然动了一下。

“波莉——哈灵顿——小姐！”他喘着气说，“你和——她住在一起！”

“是啊，我是她的外甥女。她把我接过来抚养——因为我妈妈的缘故，您知道的，”波莉安娜结结巴巴地说，声音很低沉，“她是我妈妈的妹妹，自从爸爸——去了天堂和妈妈还有其他的家人待在一起后，我身边除了妇援会就不剩什么人了。所以她就把我接了过来。”

男人没有回答。他又重新躺回了枕头，脸色苍白——白得让波莉安娜都有点害怕。她不安地站了起来。

“我想我该走了，”她说，“我——我希望您会喜欢——牛蹄冻。”

男人突然转过头来，睁开了眼睛。眼底深处充满了让人捉摸不透的渴望，波莉安娜看了非常惊讶。

“那么你是——波莉·哈灵顿小姐的外甥女。”他温和地说。

“是的，先生。”

男人深邃的眼神还在波莉安娜脸上停留，她开始有些不安了。她低声说：

“我——我想您应该是知道——她的吧。”

约翰·彭德尔顿的嘴角一弯，露出一抹怪异的笑容。

“噢，是的，我知道她。”他迟疑了一下，脸上依然是那种奇怪的笑容，继续说道，“但——你不会是——你不会是说牛蹄冻是波莉·哈灵顿小姐送给——我的吧？”

波莉安娜有点难过。

“不——先生，不是她送的。她说我必须保证不能让您认为是她送的。但我——”

“我也是这么想的。”男人低落地说，很快，就把头转过去了。波莉安娜更觉得难过了，踮起脚尖悄悄离开了房间。

在马车门道下面，她看见医生在马车里等着，护工则站在台阶上。

“啊，波莉安娜小姐，我能有幸送你回家吗？”医生微笑地问，“其实几分钟前我就已经出发啦，但我突然想起应该等等你。”

“谢谢您，先生。我很高兴您送我。我很喜欢乘马车。”波莉安娜开心不已，抓住了医生伸过来的手。

“真的吗？”医生一边微笑，一边对台阶上的护工点头道别，“呃，据我判断，你‘喜欢’做的事可不少呢——嗯？”他一边问，一边驾起了马车。

波莉安娜大笑起来。

“呃，我不知道。但我想应该是的吧，”她承认道，“与生活有关的事，大部分我都‘喜欢做’。其他的我就不喜欢了——比如缝纫啊，大声阅读啊那些事。它们不是生活。”

“不是吗？那它们都是什么？”

“波莉姨妈说它们是用来‘学会生活’的事。”波莉安娜叹了口气，苦涩地笑了一下。

医生奇怪地笑了起来。

“她是这么说的吗？好吧，我觉得她会这么说的——就像你说的那样。”

“是的，”波莉安娜回答道，“但我一点都不这么认为。我不觉得人需要学会怎么生活。我一点也不觉得。”

医生长长地叹了口气。

“不过，我恐怕我们中的有些人——不得不学学，小姑娘。”说完，他沉默了好长一段时间。波莉安娜偷偷瞥了一眼他的脸，隐隐有些忧虑，因为他看上去非常难过。她不安地想着，自己得“做点什么”。也许正是这种想法才让她小心翼翼地说：

“奇尔顿医生，我觉得医生是最令人高兴的职业。”

医生惊讶地回过头。

“‘最令人高兴’！无论我走到哪儿，看到的都是痛苦，怎么会高兴？”他叫道。

波莉安娜点点头。

“我知道，但您是在不断地帮助别人啊——难道您不知道吗？——您当然应该为此感到高兴啊！所以这让你成为我们当中最高兴的人，一直都是。”

医生的眼中倏地噙满了热泪。他的生活异常孤独，没有妻子，也没有家，仅仅是在寄宿公寓中租了两间办公室充当诊所而已。他非常热爱自己的职业。望着波莉安娜亮晶晶的眼眸，他感觉好像有一只慈爱的手突然满怀祝福地抚在了他的头上。他知道，只有波莉安娜的眼神才能让他从一整天漫长的工作或者一整夜的疲倦中重新振作起来。

“上帝保佑你，小姑娘。”他有些颤抖地说。接着，他的脸上又浮现出病人们熟悉和喜爱的灿烂微笑，说：“我在想啊，医生其实和病人一样，都需要吸收点补药呢！”听完这话，波莉安娜迷惑极了——直到一只花栗鼠穿过马路，才把她从迷惑中解救出来。

医生把波莉安娜放到门口，对着正在打扫门廊的南茜微微一笑，接着就驾车飞速离开了。

“跟医生一起乘马车真是太棒啦！”她快步走上楼梯，感叹道，“他真的很友善呢，南茜！”

“是吗？”

“是啊。我告诉他我觉得他的职业是世界上最令人高兴的职业。”

“什么！——给病人——以及那些明明没生病却觉得有病的人瞧病，还有比这个活儿更差劲儿的吗？”南茜的脸上写满怀疑的神态。

波莉安娜乐得哈哈大笑。

“是啊。他也是这么说的。不过，还是有个办法感到高兴的。猜猜是什么！”

南茜皱着眉头使劲地想啊想啊。她现在玩这个“高兴游戏”已经很熟练了，而且非常享受去研究波莉安娜的“难题”，她把它称之为“小姑娘的问题”。

“噢，我知道了，”她咯咯笑起来，“正好跟您和斯诺夫人说的反过来。”

“反过来？”波莉安娜疑惑地重复了一遍。

“是啊。您告诉过她：她应该感到高兴，因为其他的人不像她整天病歪歪的。是吧。”

“是啊。”波莉安娜点点头。

“那么，医生应该高兴，因为他不像其他人——我指的是，他治的那些生病的人。”南茜得意扬扬地说。

波莉安娜却皱起了眉头。

“呃，好——好吧。”她说，“当然这也是一种解释，但这不是我要说的那种。而且——不管怎样，我不是很喜欢这种解释。因为他肯定不会因为病人生病了而感到高兴的。但——南茜，有时候你玩起这个游戏来还真是有意思呢。”她叹了口气，走进了房子。

波莉安娜看到姨妈正在客厅里坐着。

“波莉安娜，那个人是谁——把你送到院子里那个人？”波莉小姐有点严厉地问。

“啊，波莉姨妈，那是奇尔顿医生啊！难道您不认识他吗？”

“奇尔顿医生！他来这儿——做什么？”

“他送我回家啊。噢，我已经把牛蹄冻给了彭德尔顿先生，还有——”

波莉小姐马上抬起了头。

“波莉安娜，他没有以为是我送的吧？”

“噢，没有，波莉姨妈。我告诉他不是您送的。”

波莉姨妈的脸马上泛起了红晕。

“你告诉他不是我送的！”

波莉安娜睁大了眼睛，姨妈的语气里有种抗议似的失落。

“啊，波莉姨妈，是您这样说的啊！”

波莉姨妈叹了口气。

“波莉安娜，我说不是我送的，是为了让你确保不要让他认为是我送的——但这并不是说你要直接告诉他不是我送的啊。”说罢，她气呼呼地离开了。

“天哪！唉，我真是没有看出来有什么不同啊。”波莉安娜叹了口气，把帽子挂在了姨妈指定的挂钩上。





第十六章　红玫瑰和蕾丝围巾


波莉安娜从约翰·彭德尔顿先生家回来后差不多有一周的时间了。这天恰逢下雨，蒂莫西驾车送波莉小姐去妇援会社团参加午后聚会。等她三点钟回来的时候，她的脸颊红得发亮，头发被湿润的风吹得乱乱的，卷成了一团，发卡也不知道哪儿去了。

波莉安娜从没有见过姨妈这个样子。

“噢——噢——噢！啊，波莉姨妈，您也有啊！”她兴奋得手舞足蹈地大叫，围着姨妈一圈一圈地跳来跳去，直到她走进客厅。

“有什么？你这个令人吃惊的孩子！”

波莉安娜仍然围着姨妈一圈圈转着。

“我还从来不知道您有这些呢！是不是拥有它们的人都不知道自己拥有它们呢？您觉得我也会有吗？——我是说，在我去天堂之前。”她叫喊着，急切地用手指勾出耳朵上面的一缕直发，“不过，如果它们真的出现了，将不会是黑色。您可藏不住黑色的部分。”

“波莉安娜，你到底是什么意思啊？”波莉姨妈问，匆忙摘下帽子，试图把吹乱的头发向后梳整齐。

“不，不——求您了，波莉姨妈！”波莉安娜兴高采烈的声音变成了可怜巴巴的请求，“别把它们梳起来！我说的就是这个意思——就是这些可爱的黑色卷发。噢，波莉姨妈，它们太好看啦！”

“胡说！波莉安娜，你那天去妇援会面前帮那个小乞丐做那些荒谬的事，到底是什么意思？”

“这可不是胡说啊，”波莉安娜急忙说，但只回答了她姨妈前面的那句话，“您不知道您头发卷成那样有多好看！噢，波莉姨妈，求您了，我能像帮斯诺夫人那样帮您盘发，并为它别上一朵花吗？我好想看到那样子的您啊！啊，您将比她还要漂亮！”

“波莉安娜！”（波莉小姐严厉地说道——语气更重，因为波莉安娜的话给了她一种莫名的激动：哪有人曾经关心过她或者她的头发是什么样的呢？又有谁“喜欢”看到她“漂亮”的样子？）“波莉安娜，你还没有回答我的问题呢。你为什么要去妇援会做出如此荒谬的事？”

“是的，我知道。但是，我真的不知道这很荒谬，直到我发现，比起吉米，她们更关心报告上数字的增长。所以我就给我家乡的妇援会写了信——因为您知道，吉米离她们足够远了，所以我想她们应该可以把他当成印度小男孩来养了——波莉姨妈，我是您收养的印度小女孩吗？还有，波莉姨妈，您会让我帮您盘头发的，会的吧？”

波莉姨妈把手放在喉咙上——她知道，那种熟悉的、无助的感觉又涌了上来。

“但是，波莉安娜，今天下午当妇援会的女士们告诉我你如何找到她们的时候，我觉得很羞愧！我——”

波莉安娜又开始踮起脚尖轻快地跳上跳下。

“您没有——您没有说我不能帮您盘头发呢，”她得意扬扬地欢呼道，“所以我肯定这就是说您是另外一种意思——就像那天虽然您没有给彭德尔顿先生送牛蹄冻，但并不想让我说不是您送的。那现在就在这儿等着我，我去拿梳子。”

“可是，波莉安娜，波莉安娜！”波莉姨妈抗议道，跟着小女孩气喘吁吁上了楼。

“噢，您也上来啦？”波莉安娜在波莉小姐的房门口迎接了她，“那这样更好啦！我拿到梳子啦，快请坐下，就在这儿。噢，我太高兴您能让我帮您盘头啦！”

“但，波莉安娜，我——我——”

波莉小姐还没说完，就惊讶地发现自己已经无助地坐在梳妆台前面的矮凳上，耳边的头发正被十根急切而温柔的手指捋到一旁。

“噢，我的天！您的头发真美丽啊，”波莉安娜天真地说，“比斯诺夫人的还要美丽好多呢！但您还是需要更加美丽，因为您身体好好的，可以去那些能让人们看见您的秀发的地方。天哪！我想别人看到您的头发一定会很高兴的——而且也会非常惊讶，因为您把它们藏得太久啦。啊，波莉姨妈，我要把您打扮得漂漂亮亮的，让每个人都喜欢看到您！”

“波莉安娜！”披散的头发下传来一声快要喘不过气来的惊呼，“我——我真是不知道为什么会同意你做这种愚蠢的事。”

“啊，波莉姨妈，我想您会很高兴人们都喜欢看到您！难道您不喜欢看那些美丽的东西吗？我看到漂亮的人们会感到更加的开心呢，因为我看到不好看的人就会为他们感到难过。”

“但——但——”

“我特别喜欢给别人梳头，”波莉安娜满意地咕哝道，“我帮妇援会的很多女士都梳过头——但她们中没有任何人的头发能如您的这般漂亮。不过，怀特夫人的头发还是很好的。有一天我帮她打扮了一下，可好看了——噢，波莉姨妈，我刚好想到了一些事情！不过这是秘密，我不能说。现在您的头发差不多已经盘好啦，我先离开您一分钟，您必须保证——保证——保证不要弄乱，也不能偷看，直到我回来。记得哦！”说完，她就飞奔出房间了。

一直嚷嚷的波莉小姐什么也没说，琢磨着得马上解开出自她外甥女之手的这个荒谬作品，再把头发像原来那样梳起来。还什么“偷看”，就好像她很在乎——

此时——她也解释不清楚为什么——她瞥到梳妆镜中的自己，她所看见的令她的脸瞬时染上了玫瑰色的红晕——并且她看得越仔细就越是发红。

她看到了一张面孔——不再年轻，这是真的——但却因为激动和惊讶而神采奕奕。脸颊红红的，眼睛亮亮的。浓黑的发丝，带着室外空气的湿润，蓬松卷曲地落在额前，耳后的秀发恰到好处地卷曲成柔软的小卷四处散落着。

波莉小姐盯着镜子惊呆了，入了神，以至于完全忘记了她本来想做的事，直到听见波莉安娜又回到房间。她还没来得及挪动，就感到眼睛被一块叠好的滑溜溜的东西蒙了起来，还在脑后打了一个结。

“波莉安娜，波莉安娜！你在干什么？”她叫道。

波莉安娜咯咯笑了起来。

“我不告诉您，波莉姨妈。我怕您会偷看，所以我拿手绢蒙住了您的眼睛。那现在坐好，只需要等一分钟，我就可以让您看啦。”

“但是波莉安娜，”波莉小姐又说，盲目地挣扎着想站起来，“你必须给我把这个解开！你——这个孩子！这个孩子！你到底在干什么？”她喘着气说，却感到有某个柔软的东西滑落在她的肩膀上。

波莉安娜咯咯笑得更厉害了。她用颤抖的手指将一件带有羊毛褶皱和漂亮蕾丝的围巾披在了姨妈的肩膀上。泛黄的围巾压在箱底有些年头了，散发着薰衣草的香气。波莉安娜是在上周南茜打扫阁楼的时候发现这条围巾的，而今天她突然想到，觉得为什么她的姨妈不能和西部老家的怀特夫人一样，漂漂亮亮地打扮起来呢。

她的任务终于完成啦，波莉安娜满意地审视着自己的作品，但又想起来好像还缺点什么，便连忙把姨妈推到日光浴室。在那儿，她看见有一朵晚开的玫瑰花正怒放在花架上，触手可及。

“波莉安娜，你在干什么？你要带我到哪里去？”波莉姨妈有点畏缩，想要往回走，但却只是徒劳，“波莉安娜，我不能——”

“只是去日光浴室啦——就一分钟！马上就好啦，”波莉安娜气喘吁吁地说着，用手摘下玫瑰，插进波莉小姐左耳上面柔软的头发里，“看！”她欣喜若狂地解开了手帕，一下子扔出去好远，“噢，波莉姨妈，我肯定您看到我给您的打扮会非常高兴的！”

波莉小姐盯着打扮好的自己看了好一会儿，又转头看了看。突然，她低声叫了一下，立马冲回房间。波莉安娜顺着刚才姨妈惊慌失措的眼神看过去，透过日光浴室开着的窗户，她看到一辆马车正在转弯。她立马就认出了拿缰绳的人，开心地往前倾了倾身子。

“奇尔顿医生，奇尔顿医生！您是来看我的吗？我在楼上呢。”

“是啊，”奇尔顿医生微笑道，表情有点凝重，“你能下来一下吗？”

卧室里，波莉安娜发现姨妈红着脸，正气呼呼地拔着固定蕾丝围巾的针脚。

“波莉安娜，你怎么能这样？”波莉姨妈抱怨道，“你把我搞成这副样子，还让我被别人——看见了！”

波莉安娜沮丧地停下脚步。

“但是您看上去美丽极了——特别美丽。波莉姨妈，还有——”

“‘美丽’！”她自嘲，一下子把围巾扯到一边，用颤抖的手指抓着自己的头发。

“噢，波莉姨妈，求您了，求您让头发保持这样吧！”

“保持？像这个样子？好像我就喜欢这样似的！”波莉小姐把头发紧紧地向后面拉。终于，最后一个发卷也在她的手指下消失了。

“噢，天哪！您真的看上去漂亮极了。”波莉安娜几乎都要哭出来了，踉踉跄跄地跑了出去。

在楼下，波莉安娜看到医生正坐在马车里等她。

“我把你当成药方开给一位病人了，他让我来取药呢，”医生说，“你会去的吧？”

“您是说——有个去药店的——差事？”波莉安娜有点不确定地问，“我曾经去过——为了妇援会的女士们。”

医生微笑着摇摇头。

“并非如此。是约翰·彭德尔顿先生啦。他今天想见你，如果你愿意去的话。雨停了，所以我就来接你啦。你要去吗？到时候我会去接你，六点之前保证把你送回来。”

“我当然愿意啦！”波莉安娜大叫，“我得先问一下波莉姨妈。”

过了一会儿，她回来了，手里拿着帽子，但是表情有些严肃。

“是不是——你姨妈不让你去啊？”他们一上路，医生有点不确定地问。

“不——不是啊，”波莉安娜叹了口气，“我觉得她应该是——太想让我去了。”

“太想让你去？”

波莉安娜又叹了口气。

“是的。我想她的意思应该是不想让我再待在那儿了。您看，她说：‘可以，可以，快去，快去——快！我巴不得你快去呢。’”

医生笑了笑——但只是嘴角扬了扬。他的眼神凝重，好一会儿都没说话。接着，他有点犹豫地问道：

“几分钟前——在日光浴室窗户旁和你在一起的，是——你的姨妈吗？”

波莉安娜深深地吸了一口气。

“是的。我觉得，问题就出在这儿。您知道，我给她披上了我从阁楼里找到的一条特别漂亮的围巾，还把她的头发盘好，别了一朵玫瑰花。她看上去美丽极了。难道您不认为她很美丽吗？”

医生好一阵子都没有回答。当他又出声的时候，声音低得波莉安娜只能听到只言片语。

“是的，波莉安娜，我——我觉得她美丽——极了。”

“您真的这么认为吗？我太高兴啦！我会转达给她的。”小女孩颇为满意地点点头。

医生突然的大叫让波莉安娜感到十分惊讶。

“不要！波莉安娜，我——我恐怕得要求你千万不要告诉她——我说的话。”

“为什么啊？奇尔顿医生！为什么不呢？我还以为您会非常高兴——”

“但她也许会不高兴。”医生打断道。

波莉安娜认真地想了一会儿。

“这倒是——她有可能会不高兴，”她叹了口气，“我想起来了，因为她看到您就跑开了。后来她——她还说她被马车上的人看到了。”

“我也是这么想的。”医生轻声道。

“但我还是不知道为什么，”波莉安娜坚持道，“——她看上去真的很美啊！”

医生没有说什么，直到他们快抵达那所石头大房子之前，他都没有再开口。而此时，摔断了腿的约翰·彭德尔顿正在里面躺着呢。





第十七章　“仿佛一本书”


约翰·彭德尔顿今天见到波莉安娜的时候露出了微笑。

“嗯，波莉安娜小姐，我正想着你肯定是一个宽容的小大人，否则你今天绝不会再来看我的。”

“噢，彭德尔顿先生，我真的很高兴来看您，而且我也没想到不来看您的理由啊。”

“噢，好吧，那个，我恐怕总是对你发脾气。就像那天你好心给我送牛蹄冻，还有那天你第一个发现我摔坏了腿，我都没给你好脸色看。而且，顺便说一句，我好像至今都没有为这两件事感谢过你。现在，我确信连你自己都得承认，在经受了如此忘恩负义的对待后，你还肯来看我，是多么的宽宏大量啊！”

波莉安娜不安地挪了挪步子。

“但我很高兴能发现您啊——就是，我当然不是说因为您的腿摔坏了而高兴。”她连忙纠正道。

约翰·彭德尔顿微微一笑。

“我明白。你的舌头有的时候也会不听使唤，对不，波莉安娜小姐？无论如何，我真的非常感谢你，那天你所做的一切都让我觉得你是一个非常勇敢的小姑娘。同时也非常感谢你的牛蹄冻。”他用更为轻柔的语气补充道。

“您喜欢吃吗？”波莉安娜兴致勃勃地问道。

“非常喜欢，我猜——今天不会再有了吧——波莉姨妈不会再给我牛蹄冻了，对吧？”他问道，脸上挂着一丝奇怪的笑容。

他的小访客看上去很难过。

“没——没有了，先生。”她犹豫了一下，又变得神采奕奕起来，“噢，彭德尔顿先生，那天我说牛蹄冻不是波莉姨妈送的，并非粗鲁无礼。”

约翰·彭德尔顿没有回答，脸上的微笑也消失了。他的眼睛直勾勾地望着前方，目光好像已经穿越面前的一切。过了一会儿，他长长地叹了口气，转向波莉安娜。说话声音又带上了之前的那种焦躁不安。

“好了，好了，再也不会这么做了！这次我可不是让你来看我无精打采的样子的。听好了！在书房外面——你知道的，就是那个有电话的大房间外面——在离壁炉不远的角落，你会看到有一个带玻璃门的大柜子，在柜子的下面一层放着一个有浮雕的盒子。如果那个讨厌的女用没有把它‘归置’到别处的话，它应该就在那儿！你去把它拿过来。盒子有点重，但我觉得还没有重到你拿不动它。”

“噢，我可强壮啦！”波莉安娜高兴地跳起来。一分钟不到，她就抱着盒子回来了。

接下来的半个小时波莉安娜过得非常开心。盒子里面装得满满的都是宝贝——约翰·彭德尔顿这些年旅行搜集的小玩意儿——每一个都记录着一段有趣的故事，不论是那套从中国带来的雕刻精美的象棋棋子，还是那尊从印度带来的小玉石雕像。

当波莉安娜听完玉石雕像的故事之后，她渴望地喃喃自语：

“啊，看来比起吉米·比恩，还是抚养一个印度小男孩要好一些——印度小男孩只会觉得上帝就是玉石雕像的样子，而吉米却知道上帝是在天上。不过，我还是止不住希望除了印度小男孩之外，她们还能够抚养吉米·比恩。”

约翰·彭德尔顿好像没有听到波莉安娜在说什么。他眼神空洞，直直地盯着前面。但很快，他又直了直腰，拿出另一件珍宝讲了起来。

这次拜访的确非常愉快。但在结束之前，波莉安娜意识到他们除了谈论了漂亮浮雕盒子里稀奇古怪的宝贝之外，还聊了一些其他的话题。他们聊了波莉安娜自己、南茜、波莉姨妈，还有她的日常生活。他们甚至还谈到了很久以前波莉安娜远在西部小镇的生活和家。

直到小女孩快要离开的时候，一贯严肃的约翰·彭德尔顿才用一种波莉安娜从没有听过的语气说：

“小姑娘，我希望你能经常来看我，好吗？我很寂寞，我需要你。还有一个原因是——我会告诉你的。一开始，当我知道你是谁的时候，我再也不想让你来了。你让我想起了——想起了一些我努力了很多年试图忘记的事情。所以我对自己说，我再也不想见到你了。每天，医生问我是否让他接你过来的时候，我都说不要。但过了一段时间，我发现我是如此地想见你——看不到你反而让我想忘记的那些事情更加生动地被回忆起来。所以，现在我希望你来。你会吗——小姑娘？”

“啊，是的，彭德尔顿先生，”波莉安娜轻声说，亮晶晶的眼睛充满同情地望着面前这个躺在枕头上、神情悲伤的男人，“我非常愿意来！”

“谢谢你。”约翰·彭德尔顿温柔地说。





那天傍晚吃完晚餐，波莉安娜坐在屋后的门廊上，给南茜一五一十地讲了约翰·彭德尔顿先生那个漂亮奇异的浮雕盒子，还有里面装的更加奇异的各种宝贝。

“瞧瞧，”南茜叹了口气，“他居然给您看了所有的这些稀罕玩意儿，还告诉了您这些稀罕事儿——他脾气那么坏，从不跟别人说话——谁也没说过！”

“噢，他脾气并不坏，南茜，只是外表看上去那样而已。”波莉安娜十分真诚地反驳了南茜的看法，“我不明白为什么每个人都觉得他很糟糕。如果他们了解他的话，就不会这么说了。但就连波莉姨妈也非常不喜欢他。你知道，她不让我送牛蹄冻给他，而且她非常害怕彭德尔顿先生会以为是她送的！”

“也许她觉得没有义务送给他，”南茜耸耸肩，“但我闹不明白他咋对您就这么不一样呢，波莉安娜小姐——当然，我没有冒犯您的意思——但他真不是那种喜欢小孩儿的人，真不是，真不是。”

波莉安娜开心地笑了起来。

“但他确实是这样的啊，南茜，”她点点头，“但我觉得他也不想——总是这样的。瞧，今天他还承认说曾经一度不想再见到我了，因为我让他想起了一些他想忘掉的事情。但后来——”

“啥事儿？”南茜兴奋地插嘴道，“他说您让他想起了一些想忘掉的事儿？”

“是的，但是后来——”

“那是啥事儿？”南茜急切地追问。

“他也没告诉我，他只是说有那么些事。”

“是那个秘密！”南茜压低了声音神秘地说，“所以他会让您去他房间。噢，波莉安娜小姐！啊，这就跟书里写的一个样儿啊——我读了好多这样的书，什么《莫德小姐的秘密》啦，《失踪的继承者》啦，还有《消失多年》啦——这些书里面都有秘密，还有故事，就跟这一个样儿。我的天啊！瞧瞧，鼻子底下就有一本活生生的书，而我竟然一点都不知道！快点把所有的事儿都告诉我吧——他说的所有的事儿，波莉安娜小姐，肯定有问题！难怪他这么喜欢你，难怪——难怪！”

“但他一开始并没有，”波莉安娜叫道，“是我先开口跟他讲话的。直到我拿牛蹄冻给他，他才知道我是谁呢。我还告诉他，说牛蹄冻不是波莉姨妈送的，还有——”

南茜突然跳起来，拍着手说：

“噢，波莉安娜小姐，我知道啦，我知道啦——我知道，我知道啦！”南茜激动地大喊道。紧接着，她又坐回波莉安娜身边。

“告诉我——现在想想，直接如实地回答我，”她满心激动地催促道，“他是在发现您是波莉小姐的外甥女时之后才说他再也不想见到您的，对吗？”

“噢，是的。我上一次见他的时候跟他说的，他今天是这么告诉我的。”

“我也是这么想的，”南茜得意地说，“波莉小姐也不愿意送牛蹄冻给他，对吗？”

“是的。”

“然后您告诉了他不是波莉小姐送的？”

“呃，是的，我——”

“然后当他一发现您是波莉小姐的外甥女时就立马显得很奇怪，还突然间大叫，对吗？”

“呃，是——是的，他的行为确实有点古怪——对于那个牛蹄冻。”波莉安娜承认道，思索的眉头皱了起来。

南茜长长地吸了口气。

“现在我很确定了！听好了，约翰·彭德尔顿先生就是波莉·哈灵顿小姐曾经的爱人！”她十分严肃认真地宣布，又偷偷向后瞥了一眼。

“啊，南茜，他才不是呢！姨妈一点也不喜欢他。”波莉安娜反对道。

南茜不屑地瞥了她一眼。

“她当然不喜欢喽，因为他们吵过架！”

波莉安娜还是不相信。南茜又深深吸了口气，很兴奋地开始讲起了故事。

“事情是这样儿的。您来之前，汤姆先生告诉我波莉小姐曾经有个恋人。我才不相信呢。我不能相信——她竟然有过恋人！但汤姆先生说她确实有过的，而且他现在也住在咱们镇上。现在我可算弄明白了，就是约翰·彭德尔顿。他不是有个秘密吗？他不是把自己一个人关在那座大房子里，从来不跟别人说话吗？当他发现您是波莉小姐的外甥女之后，表现不是很奇怪吗？他不是承认说您让他想起了很多想忘掉的事儿吗？还有谁看不出来就是波莉小姐啊！——而且她也说不会给他送牛蹄冻。哎呀，波莉安娜小姐，这不是明摆着的事儿嘛！”

“噢——噢！”波莉安娜小声叫起来，惊讶地睁大了眼睛，“但是，南茜，我想如果他们相爱的话，他们应该会和好的。而现在他们两个人都孤孤单单地生活了这么多年。他们应该很高兴和好的吧！”

南茜轻蔑地哼了哼鼻子。

“我想可能您还不是很懂恋人之间的事儿吧，波莉安娜小姐，您还是太小啦。如果您的‘高兴游戏’对这世上有些人不起作用的话，这俩人就是。他们一定是经常吵架的一对儿。难道他不是一直都像木棍儿一样直愣愣的？——难道她不是——”

南茜突然闭上了嘴巴，想起了她是在同谁讲话，又是在谈论谁。但她突然又咯咯笑了起来。

“我就不多说了，波莉安娜小姐。但是如果您能让他们玩那个游戏的话，这肯定是件不错的事儿——他们会很高兴和好的。天哪！人们不会盯着——波莉小姐和他吧！我想，估计可能性不大，可能性不大！”

波莉安娜什么也没说，但不一会儿，等她回屋的时候，脸上写满了心事。





第十八章　棱镜


炎热的八月一天天过去了，波莉安娜已经成了彭德尔顿山庄大房子里的常客。但她并不觉得自己的拜访算得上成功。虽然彭德尔顿先生是想让她来家里的——他确实经常派人去请她，但等她到了那儿，他又几乎没有因她的出现而感到更加开心——至少，波莉安娜是这么认为的。

他会跟她说话，这倒是真的，他会给她展示许多新奇漂亮的东西——书啊，画啊，还有古董啊。但还是能听到他因为自己的无助而烦躁不安，也看得到他因为家里讨厌的用人列出的规矩和“归置”而抱怨不停。不管怎样，他看上去确实挺喜欢听波莉安娜说话，于是波莉安娜就跟他说话，她也喜欢说话——但她说不准什么时候抬头就会看见他正满脸苍白、神情悲伤地躺在枕头上，那样的神情总是令她悲痛；她也说不准自己的哪句话——如果真有的话——被他听到心里去了。至于跟他说“高兴游戏”，以及试着让他参与这个游戏的事——波莉安娜更是从没见过哪一次他真的用心听了。有那么两次，她试图告诉他，但每次她一提到父亲说了什么时就没法继续下去了——约翰·彭德尔顿每次都会把话题陡然转到别的事情上。

波莉安娜现在不再怀疑约翰·彭德尔顿就是波莉姨妈曾经的爱人了。她希望能够通过自己爱的力量，和忠诚的心以某种方式给他们——在她看来——可悲、寂寞的生活带来快乐。

眼下她就要去做这件事，但还没有什么眉目。她跟彭德尔顿先生谈起过她的姨妈，他听着，有时彬彬有礼，有时心急气躁，还时常把古怪的笑容挂在严肃的嘴角。而当她跟波莉姨妈谈起彭德尔顿先生的时候——或者说，她试着跟姨妈说起他的时候，通常情况下，她都不会听——至少不会听很久，她总是会把话题转移开。不过，当波莉安娜说到别人——比如奇尔顿医生的时候，她也经常这个样子。不过，波莉安娜把这一切都归因于奇尔顿医生看到了她在日光浴室里头发别着玫瑰花、肩上披着蕾丝披肩的样子。有一天，当波莉安娜患了感冒被关在家里的时候，她发现波莉姨妈好像的确特别讨厌奇尔顿医生。

“如果你今天晚上还没有好一点的话，我就派人去请医生。”波莉姨妈说。

“真的吗？那我会越来越糟糕的，”波莉安娜咯咯笑了起来，“我希望奇尔顿医生来看我！”

当时姨妈脸上的表情让她非常惊愕。

“奇尔顿医生不会来的，波莉安娜，”波莉小姐严厉地说，“奇尔顿医生不是我们的家庭医生。我会去请沃伦医生——如果你的情况变得更糟糕的话。”

波莉安娜的病情并没有加重，沃伦医生也就没有来。

“我也很高兴，”波莉安娜那天晚上跟姨妈说，“我当然也挺喜欢沃伦医生的，但我更喜欢奇尔顿医生。我怕如果我不找他的话，他会伤心的。您看，他确实不应该被指责，毕竟那天他只是碰巧看到了我将您打扮得漂漂亮亮的样子，波莉姨妈。”她颇为期待地说。

“好了，波莉安娜。我实在不想再谈论奇尔顿医生——以及他的感受了。”波莉姨妈果断地责备道。

波莉安娜黯然神伤地盯着波莉姨妈好一会儿，然后叹了口气说：

“我只是爱看您脸颊像那样红红的样子，波莉姨妈。但我很想给您盘头发。如果——唉，波莉姨妈！”但她的姨妈早已经走出了她的视线，下楼到大厅里去了。





八月底的一天早上，波莉安娜正在拜访约翰·彭德尔顿，她发现有一道由蓝色、橙色和绿色组成的，镶着红色和紫色的边的发光彩带正躺在他的枕头上。她顿时惊喜地停住了步伐。

“噢，彭德尔顿先生，是小彩虹啊——一道真正的彩虹来看望您啦！”她轻轻地拍手大叫道，“噢——噢——噢，多漂亮啊！但它是怎么进来的呢？”她叫喊着。

男人笑得有点冷：今早，约翰·彭德尔顿的心情特别不好。

“呃，我猜它应该是透过窗户上玻璃温度计锥形的边缘‘进来’的吧，”他无精打采地说，“太阳不会一整天照在那儿的，只是在早上才会。”

“噢，但这真的好漂亮啊，彭德尔顿先生！只要有太阳就可以做到吗？天哪！如果我拥有这个温度计的话，我要把它一整天都挂在太阳上！”

“你可以从温度计那里得到不少好东西，那么，”男人笑起来，“如果你把它挂在太阳上，你要怎么知道有多热，或有多冷呢？”

“我才不在意呢，”波莉安娜轻轻说，她的眼睛着迷地盯着枕头上那条光芒四射的彩带，“就好像一直住在彩虹上的人也不会在意一样！”

男人大笑。他有点好奇地盯着波莉安娜全神贯注的小脸，突然灵光一闪。他摇响了手边的铃铛。

“诺拉，”当那位上了年纪的女用出现在门口的时候，他说道，“把会客厅前面壁炉架上的那个大黄铜烛台拿过来给我。”

“是，先生。”女用讷讷地说，看上去有点不知所以。不一会儿，她就回来了。她往床前走的时候，还挺奇怪为什么会有音乐般叮叮咚咚的声音。这声音是她手中垂挂在老式烛台四周的棱柱形装饰发出来的。

“谢谢。放在这个台子上吧，”男人吩咐道，“现在去拿一根细绳，系在窗户边固定窗帘的钩子上，然后把窗帘放下来，让绳子横跨整个窗户。就这样吧。谢谢。”等她拿来烛台后，他说道。

女用离开房间后，他满眼笑意地望向摸不着头脑的波莉安娜。

“现在，请把烛台拿过来吧，波莉安娜。”

波莉安娜用双手把烛台递了过来。不一会儿工夫，彭德尔顿就把烛台上的垂饰一个个摘了下来，在床上依次摆成了一个环状。

“现在，亲爱的，拿着它们，把它们挂到诺拉刚才拉的那条横跨窗户的绳子上去吧。如果你真的很想住在彩虹上——我看不大可能，但我们可以造一个彩虹让你去住！”

在阳光照射下的窗户旁，波莉安娜挂了不到三个装饰物就已经看出一点端倪。她非常激动，以至于无法控制自己颤抖的手指把剩下的挂上去了。不过，她最终还是完成了任务。她往后退了几步，高兴地低声惊叹起来。

这间豪华却沉闷的卧室已经变成了一个童话的世界。

房间的每个角落都跳动着红色、绿色、紫色、橙色、金色还有蓝色的小光点。墙上、地板上、家具上，甚至是床上，都闪烁跃动着五彩斑斓的光点。

“噢，噢，噢，多么美妙啊！”波莉安娜轻轻地感叹，又突然间笑起来，“我想太阳自己现在也在玩这个游戏呢，是不是？”她叫道，忘记了彭德尔顿先生此时还不知道她在说什么呢。“噢，我多想拥有这些东西啊！我多想把它们送给波莉姨妈和斯诺夫人啊——还有很多很多人。我想他们一定会很高兴的！噢，我想，如果波莉姨妈住在这彩虹上，即便是她也会高兴地忍不住砰砰关门的，你觉得呢？”

彭德尔顿先生大笑起来。

“呃，根据我对你姨妈的记忆来看，波莉安娜小姐，我必须说，除了这些阳光下的棱镜之外，还得需要点别的东西——才能让她高兴得把门关得砰砰响。不过，现在先告诉我，你是什么意思？”

波莉安娜稍稍盯了他一下，然后深深地吸了口气。

“噢，我给忘啦，您还不知道这个游戏呢。现在我想起来了。”

“那就告诉我吧。”

这次，波莉安娜一五一十地告诉了他整件事情，从最开始——想要玩具娃娃却得到了一副拐杖说起。她不停地说着，并没有看他的脸。她着迷的目光依然定格在舞动着的五彩斑斓的光点上。这些光点正随着阳光照射的玻璃上棱镜垂饰的摇摆而不断跳动着。

“就是这样啦，”她说完以后，叹了口气，“现在您知道为什么我说太阳也在玩——这个游戏了吧。”

一阵沉默。接着，一个低沉的声音从床上传出来，颤抖着说：

“也许吧，但在我看来，最美的棱镜就是你自己，波莉安娜。”

“噢，但阳光穿过我的时候，我没法变出美丽的红色，还有绿色，还有紫色呢，彭德尔顿先生。”

“你变不出来吗？”男人微笑道。波莉安娜看着他的脸，想知道他的眼中为什么会有泪水。

“变不出来啊。”她说。

过了一小会儿，她有些难过地说：“彭德尔顿先生，恐怕太阳在我身上变不出什么来，除了雀斑。波莉姨妈说它们就是被太阳晒出来的！”

男人笑了笑，波莉安娜又看了看他：他的笑声像是在啜泣。





第十九章　有些惊讶


九月份，波莉安娜上学了。学前测验表明，她的智力水平已远远超过了同年龄段的女孩，她很快就成为了同龄的男孩女孩所组成的班级里快乐的一员。

对于波莉安娜来说，学校在很多方面都让她感到非常惊奇。当然，波莉安娜对于学校来说，也是一个不小的惊喜。总之，她和学校很快就相处得十分融洽。她还对波莉姨妈坦承，说上学也是一种生活——尽管之前她还心存疑虑。

尽管她对于新的生活感到非常开心，但她也并没有忘记老朋友们。当然了，她现在没有办法花太多的时间与他们在一起，但她把能自由支配的时间都花在了他们身上。或许，这些老朋友里就数彭德尔顿先生最有怨言了。

一个星期六的下午，他跟她提到了这点。

“听着，波莉安娜，你愿不愿意搬过来和我一起住啊？”他有点不耐烦地问，“最近我都听不到你的消息了。”

波莉安娜笑起来——彭德尔顿先生真是个有趣的人！

“我以为您不喜欢有人围着您呢。”她说。

他做了个怪脸。

“噢，但那是你在教我玩这个特别棒的游戏之前啊。现在我可是从头到脚都很高兴被人围着呢！没关系，反正我过几天就可以自己下床走路了，到时候我就看看谁会来看我。”说完，他拿起身边的一根拐杖在小女孩面前开玩笑似的晃了晃。今天，他们正坐在大书房里。

“噢，但您不是真的对所有的事都感到开心啊，这是您说的，”波莉安娜噘着嘴，盯着壁炉前打盹的小狗说，“您看您每次都玩不好这个游戏，彭德尔顿先生——您知道您没玩好！”

男人的表情一下子变得很严肃。

“因此我才需要你，小姑娘——来帮助我玩这个游戏。你会来吗？”

波莉安娜惊讶地转过身。

“彭德尔顿先生，您不会真的是——这个意思吧？”

“是真的，我需要你。你会来吗？”

波莉安娜看上去有点忧虑。

“唉，彭德尔顿先生，我没法来——您知道我没办法。因为，我是——波莉姨妈家的！”

一些波莉安娜不太明白的东西在男人脸上一闪而过。他的头猛地抬了起来。

“你也可以不是她家的——或许她会让你来跟我一起住，”他的语气温和了下来，“你会来跟我一起住吗——如果她同意的话？”

波莉安娜皱着眉头，陷入沉思。

“可是波莉姨妈一直都对我——那么好。”她缓缓地说，“是她在我只有妇援会的时候收留了我，还有——”

男人的脸又抽搐了一下，但这次，他的声音变得低沉而悲伤。

“波莉安娜，很多年前，我深深地爱上了一个人。我希望有一天能够把她接到这栋房子里来住。我想象着我们一起在家里度过漫长岁月时将会有多么的快乐。”

“是的。”波莉安娜惋惜地说，眼睛里面充满同情。

“但是——唉，我没能把她接过来。不要问我为什么，我就是没有做到。从那时起，这个灰色石头堆起来的就只是一栋房子——不是一个家了。只有女人的手和心，还有孩子的出现，才能组成一个家，波莉安娜。这两样东西，我一样也没有。现在，亲爱的，你愿意来了吗？”

波莉安娜跳起来，她的脸上神采奕奕。

“彭德尔顿先生，您——您的意思是您希望您——您现在想拥有女人的手还有心？”

“呃，是——是的，波莉安娜。”

“噢，我太高兴了！那就好了，”小女孩感叹道，“现在您可以把我们两个人都接过来，一切就都解决了。”

“把你们——两个人——都接过来？”男人一头雾水地重复道。

波莉安娜的表情闪现了一丝犹豫。

“噢，当然，波莉姨妈还没有被说服，但如果您能把跟我说的话跟她再说一遍的话，我敢肯定，我们俩都会来的。”

男人的眼中突然露出惊恐的神情。

“波莉姨妈——来这儿！”

波莉安娜将眼睛睁大了些。

“还是说您愿意住到她那儿去？”她问，“当然啦，那边的房子虽然没有这个漂亮，但要更接近——”

“波莉安娜，你在说什么啊？”男人问道，语气已经变得非常温柔。

“嗯，当然是关于我们去哪儿住啦，”波莉安娜很惊讶地回答道，“我以为您刚开始说的就是过来住呢。您说您多年以来一直想用波莉姨妈的手和心在这里组成一个家，还有——”

男人的喉咙里想发出一声大叫，但没有叫出来。他抬起手想说话，但又把手无力地垂在了身边。

“医生来了，先生。”女用站在门口说。

波莉安娜马上站了起来。

约翰·彭德尔顿急切地转向波莉安娜。“波莉安娜，看在老天的分上，不要把我问你的事情告诉别人——千万不要。”他低声恳求道。波莉安娜的脸上洋溢起阳光般的笑容。

“当然不会啦！就好像我不知道您想亲口对她说一样！”她欢快地转头说。

约翰·彭德尔顿无力地靠在了椅子上。

“啊，怎么回事？”不一会儿，医生测了测病人快速跳动的脉搏，询问道。

约翰·彭德尔顿的嘴角浮现出一丝古怪的微笑。

“你的补药给——过量了。”他大笑着，注意到医生的目光随着波莉安娜小小的身影落到了马车道门那儿。





第二十章　更加令人惊讶


礼拜天的早上，波莉安娜通常是去教堂和主日学校，下午则时常会和南茜去散散步。星期六下午在拜访了约翰·彭德尔顿先生之后，她计划第二天下午要同南茜去散步。结果，第二天上午，在她从主日学校回家的路上，奇尔顿医生驾车从后面赶上了她，停下了马车。

“让我送你回家吧，波莉安娜，”他建议道，“我有几句话要跟你说。我正想去你家找你呢。”波莉安娜便上了车，坐在他身旁。他接着说，“彭德尔顿先生特别邀请你今天下午去家里看看他，真的。他说这很重要。”

波莉安娜开心地点点头。

“是的，确实很重要，我知道啦，我会去的。”

医生有些惊讶地看着她。

“我还不确定应不应该让你去呢，”他的眼睛闪烁着，“昨天你看上去可不怎么顺心，可以说是更加烦闷一些呢，年轻的小姐。”

波莉安娜笑起来。

“噢，我没有，真的——也不全是，那个，至少没有波莉姨妈那么烦恼。”

医生马上转过头。

“你的——姨妈！”他叫起来。

波莉安娜开心地在座位上上下颠了颠。

“是啊，要知道这真是太令人激动，太美好了，就像故事一样。我——我还是告诉您吧，”她突然下定决心，脱口而出，“他说这不能告诉别人，但他当然不会介意您知道的。他的意思其实只是不能跟她说。”

“她？”

“是的，就是波莉姨妈。他肯定是想亲自告诉她，而不是让我来说喽——恋人不都是这样嘛！”

“恋人！”医生刚说完这个词，马就猛然惊了一下，就像是勒紧缰绳的手狠拽了一下缰绳似的。

“是的，”波莉安娜开心地点点头，“这就是故事的一部分，看到了吧。我一点也不知道呢，直到南茜告诉我。她说波莉姨妈许多年前有一位恋人，他们发生了争吵。她一开始也不知道这人是谁，不过我们现在发现了，就是彭德尔顿先生。”

医生一下子就放松了下来。紧握缰绳的手也无力地搭在了膝盖上。

“噢！不，我——不知道这事呢。”他平静地说。

波莉安娜赶紧继续说——他们已经快到哈灵顿大宅了。

“是啊，我现在很高兴。这真是太美好了。彭德尔顿先生问我要不要过去跟他一起住，但我当然不能离开波莉姨妈啦——她对我那么好呢。他还告诉了我他以前一直想得到一个女人的手和心。我看得出他现在还是想要的。我真是太高兴啦！因为，如果他愿意和好的话，那一切当然就很好解决啦。波莉姨妈还有我都会搬过去跟他一起住，或者他也可以过来跟我们一起住。不过，波莉姨妈现在还不知道这些，我们还没有把每件事情都安排好。所以，我想这肯定就是他今天下午想见我的原因吧。”

医生突然坐直了，嘴边露出了奇怪的笑容。

“好吧，我能想象得到约翰·彭德尔顿先生确实——很想见你，波莉安娜。”他点点头，在门口停住了马车。

“波莉姨妈在窗户那儿呢，”波莉安娜叫起来，但马上她又说，“咦，噢，她怎么又不在了——我刚刚真的看到她了啊！”

“不，她——现在没在那儿呢。”医生说，挂在嘴角的微笑也消失了。

那天下午，波莉安娜发现约翰·彭德尔顿等她的时候表现得非常紧张。

“波莉安娜，”他一见到她就立马说，“我花了一整夜来寻思你昨天说的话——关于这些年来我一直想得到的波莉姨妈的手和心这档子事。你到底是什么意思啊？”

“啊，因为你们曾经是恋人啊。我很高兴您现在还能有那样的感觉。”

“恋人！——你姨妈和我？”

男人的语气里明显地表现出不可思议，波莉安娜睁大了眼睛。

“啊，彭德尔顿先生，南茜说你曾经是姨妈的恋人啊！”

男人短促地笑了几声。

“原来是这样！好吧，我不得不说南茜——估计并不知情。”

“那么你们——不是恋人？”波莉安娜的声音又难过，又沮丧。

“从来都不是！”

“那并不像书里写的那样啰？”

彭德尔顿没有回答。他心神不定地望着窗外。

“噢，天哪！这一切本可以变得很美好的，”波莉安娜几乎要哭了，“我是多么高兴能来这儿住啊——和波莉姨妈一起。”

“那么你——现在就不会来了吗？”男人问道，并没有转过头来。

“当然不会了！我是波莉姨妈家的孩子啊。”

男人猛地转过头。

“在你是你姨妈的孩子之前，波莉安娜，你还是——你妈妈的孩子。还有——多年以前我希望拥有的，是你妈妈的手和心。”

“我妈妈的！”

“是的，我本来不想告诉你的，但是或许告诉你会更好些，毕竟，我现在——已经这样做了。”约翰·彭德尔顿的脸变得很苍白，说话都有一些困难了。波莉安娜的眼睛因为恐惧而大睁着，嘴巴也张得大大的，紧紧盯着他。

“我爱你的妈妈，但她——并不爱我。后来，她就走了——跟你爸爸一起走了。直到那时我才知道自己是多么地——在乎她。我的世界一下子就变得一片黑暗——唉，这些都无所谓了。时光荏苒，我变成了一个暴躁易怒、遭人厌烦的老家伙——不过我现在还没有到六十岁呢，波莉安娜。后来，有一天，就好像你喜欢的那些棱镜装饰一样，小姑娘，你跃进了我的生活，你阳光般的快乐向我沉闷的世界里照进了紫色、金色还有红色的光点。后来，我知道了你是谁，然后——然后我想我再也不要见到你了。我不想因为你而想起——你的妈妈。但——你知道后来发生了什么，我还是让你来了。而现在我希望你一直在我身边，波莉安娜，你会过来吗？”

“但是，彭德尔顿先生，我——还有波莉姨妈啊！”波莉安娜的眼睛里盈满泪水。

男人做了一个很不耐烦的动作。

“那我呢？你觉得，如果——没有你，我还会对什么事情感到高兴吗？唉，波莉安娜，就是因为你的到来，我才在生活中找到一些快乐！而如果你成为我的小女儿，我会对——所有的事情都感到快乐。我也会尽力让你快乐，亲爱的。你所有的愿望都会得到满足。我所有的钱，直到最后一分钱，都是为了让你快乐。”

波莉安娜看上去很震惊。

“啊，彭德尔顿先生，我怎么可能让你在我身上花钱呢——你攒下的所有钱都是为了异教徒啊！”

男人的脸慢慢爬上了红晕。他想开口说话，但是波莉安娜还在不停地说着。

“而且，所有像您一样有这么多钱的人，是不需要我来让你们感到快乐的。您可以施舍给别人而让他们感到快乐，您自己也会情不自禁地快乐起来的！啊，看看那些您给斯诺夫人和我的棱镜吊饰，还有南茜生日时您给她的金币，还有——”

“好了，好了——别再提那些事了，”男人打断道。他的脸已经变得通红了——其实或许也真是这样的：过去约翰·彭德尔顿先生可不是因为“乐善好施”而广为人知的。“没那回事。没有这么多施舍——如果有的话，也是因为你。是你给他们的这些东西，不是我！是的，是你！”他不断重复着，以此来回应波莉安娜脸上极力否认的表情。“这些只能说明我是多么需要你，小姑娘，”他又一次温柔地恳求道，“如果，如果我要玩‘高兴游戏’的话，波莉安娜，你得来跟我一起玩。”

小女孩的眉头愁得皱成一团。

“波莉姨妈对我一直都很好。”她刚开始说，男人就马上打断了她的话，以前那种易怒的表情又回到了他的脸上。对反对意见无法容忍，这种长时间以来形成的不耐烦的性格特征已经成为了约翰·彭德尔顿的内在本质，难以抑制。

“她是对你很好！但是她并不想要你，我可以保证，连我的一半都不及。”他辩解道。

“啊，彭德尔顿先生，她当然很高兴，我知道的，有我——”

“高兴！”男人再次打断了她，完全失去了耐心，“我敢打赌，波莉小姐根本就不知道怎么才能高兴——对任何事情！噢，她只是在履行她的责任，我知道。她是一个责任感很强的女人。我之前就领教过她的‘责任’。我得承认，在过去的十五或二十年里，我们一直不是最好的朋友，但我是知道她的。每个人都知道她——她不属于那种‘高兴’的人，波莉安娜。她也不知道如何成为那样的人。关于你要来我家住的事情——你只要问问她，看她是否愿意让你来就可以了。还有，噢，小姑娘，小姑娘，我真的很需要你！”他断断续续地说完了这些话。

波莉安娜站起来，长长地叹了一口气。

“好吧，我会去问她的，”她忧虑地说，“当然，我的意思并不是我不愿意过来跟您一起生活，彭德尔顿先生，但是——”她没有说完，就沉默了下来。过了一会儿，她才接着说：“嗯，不管怎么样，我还是很高兴昨天没有告诉她——因为我还以为她就是您想要的呢。”

约翰·彭德尔顿勉强笑了一下。

“好吧，波莉安娜，我想你昨天也没有跟其他人——提这事吧。”

“我没有——只跟医生说了，他肯定不算其他人吧。”

“跟医生说了！”彭德尔顿转过身，大叫道，“不是——奇尔顿——医生吧？”

“是的啊，当他来告诉我您今天想见我的时候。”

“唉，所有的——”男人低声说了一句，靠在了椅子上。

接着，他突然又来了兴趣，忙坐起来问：“奇尔顿医生说了什么？”

波莉安娜若有所思地皱了皱眉。

“唉，我也记不大清楚了。不过没说什么，我猜。噢，他说他能想象到您很想见我。”

“噢，是吗，可真是这样！”约翰·彭德尔顿回答道。波莉安娜很奇怪他怎么会有那种奇怪的笑容呢。





第二十一章　问题得到解答


波莉安娜从约翰·彭德尔顿山庄跑下山时，天色很快就变暗了，雷雨要来了。半路上，她碰见了拿着雨伞的南茜。不过，这时乌云已经转变了方向，雨一时半会儿也下不下来了。

“我就知道它会往北边儿飘，”南茜用眼睛审视着天空，说道，“我一直都是这么想的，但波莉小姐非得让我来给你送伞。她可真是为您担心呐！”

“是吗？”波莉安娜心不在焉地嘟囔了一句，也抬起头望着天上的云。

南茜微微吸了一口气。

“您好像并没有注意我说了啥啊，”南茜委屈地说，“我说您的姨妈挺担心您的呢！”

“噢，”波莉安娜叹了口气，突然又想到了她即将要问姨妈的问题，“我很抱歉，我没想吓她的。”

“哈，我很高兴呢，”南茜出人意料地说道，“真的，真的。”

波莉安娜呆住了。

“你为波莉姨妈被我吓到而感到高兴？噢，南茜，游戏可不是这么玩的——因为这种事而感到高兴！”她反对道。

“我不是在跟您玩什么游戏，”南茜说，“一点都没往那儿想。您好像并没意识到波莉小姐为您担心意味着啥啊，孩子！”

“嗯，就是担心啊——担心就是害怕啊——感到害怕，”波莉安娜坚持说，“还有别的什么意思吗？”

南茜摇了摇头。

“好吧，我告诉您是啥意思。这就是说，她终于接地气儿啦——跟普通人一样啦，她为您所做的一切不再是仅仅出于责任了。”

“噢，南茜，”波莉安娜忿忿不平地反对道，“波莉姨妈一直都在履行她的责任啊。她——她是一位极有责任感的女人！”波莉安娜没意识到，她正重复着半小时之前约翰·彭德尔顿的话呢。

南茜咯咯地笑起来。

“您说的对，我想，她是这样儿的——一直以来都是这样儿的！但打从您来了以后，她现在可不止这样儿啦。”

波莉安娜的脸色变了，眉头疑惑地皱成了一团。

“是的，这正是我想问你的，南茜，”她叹了口气，“你觉得波莉姨妈喜欢让我待在这儿吗？她会不会介意——如果，如果我不再待在这儿？”

南茜快速地瞄了一眼小女孩认真的脸。很久之前，她已经想到了会被问及这个问题，她也很害怕回答。她也曾琢磨过这个问题应该怎么回答——她该如何才能做到如实回答的同时又不伤害提问者的心呢。但现在，此时此刻，她脸上曾经浮现的新的怀疑已被下午送伞的事情转变成了一种确信——南茜只想张开双臂欢迎这一问题的到来。她今天非常地肯定，以自己纯洁的良心保证，她能够让这个渴求爱的小女孩的心感到慰藉。

“喜不喜欢您待在这儿？如果您离开了这儿，她会不会想您？”南茜愤慨地叫道，“就好像我刚才啥都没跟您说似的！她不是看到天上有丁点乌云的时候就让我赶紧给您送伞来了么？她不是让我把您的东西都拿到楼下您喜欢的漂亮房间里了么？噢，波莉安娜小姐，您不记得一开始的时候她是多么反感——”

就在此时，南茜的一阵咳嗽把话给堵了回去。

“其他的我就不细说了，”南茜喘了喘气，赶紧接着说，“有很多小事儿都表明您让她的心变软了，也让她高兴了——小猫啊，小狗啊，还有她跟我说话的方式啊，还有，噢，真的太多事儿啦。噢，波莉安娜小姐，其实根本不需要去问她是不是会想您——如果您离开的话。”南茜说完了，带着一种热情洋溢的肯定，几乎把她之前所有不好的看法都覆盖了。不过，即便这样，她还是没能对波莉安娜脸上刹那间燃起的惊喜做好准备。

“噢，南茜，我太高兴——太高兴——太高兴啦！你不知道，波莉姨妈——需要我，这让我有多么高兴啊！”

“我现在怎么会离开她呢！”波莉安娜到家后一边爬着楼梯回房间，一边想，“我一直都知道我是想跟波莉姨妈住在一起的——但我猜或许我并不知道我是多么希望波莉姨妈——也想跟我住在一起啊！”

波莉安娜知道，把自己的决定告诉约翰·彭德尔顿可不是一项容易的任务。她非常喜欢约翰·彭德尔顿，所以她为他感到很难过——因为他为自己难过，她也为令他难过的漫长而孤独的生活感到难过。她感到悲伤，因为是自己的妈妈让他度过了这么多年阴暗沉闷的岁月。她在心中描绘着那所灰色的大房子在它主人康复以后的样子：一间间寂寥的房间，扔满垃圾的地板，乱七八糟的书桌……他的孤独让她的心悲痛万分。她希望能在某个地方找到某个人——想到这儿，她高兴地轻声叫唤着，跳了起来，一个主意从她的脑袋里冒了出来。

随即，她以最快的速度跑上山岗，前往约翰·彭德尔顿的家。此时，她正坐在昏暗的大书房里，约翰·彭德尔顿正坐在她的旁边，他细长的手指随意地搭在椅子的扶手上，他那只忠诚的小狗正趴在他脚下。

“嗯，波莉安娜，‘高兴游戏’将会伴随我的余生吗？”男人温和地问道。

“噢，是的，”波莉安娜叫道，“我为您想到了一件最高兴的事去做，还有——”

“和——你一起吗？”约翰·彭德尔顿问，他的嘴角露出一丝严肃。

“不——不是的，但是——”

“波莉安娜，你怎么能说不呢！”一个感伤的声音打断了波莉安娜。

“我——我不得不这么说，彭德尔顿先生，我真的不得不。波莉姨妈——”

“她拒绝——让你——来吗？”

“我——我没有问她。”小女孩断断续续地说着，语气十分难过。

“波莉安娜！”

波莉安娜移开了她的视线，她无法直视她的朋友因为受到伤害而悲伤的眼睛。

“所以你连问都没问她？”

“我没法问，先生——真的，”波莉安娜结结巴巴地说，“您看，我已经知道答案了——不用问她。波莉姨妈想让我跟她一起住，还有——还有我也想跟她在一起。”她勇敢地坦白道，“您不知道她对我有多好，而且——而且我有时确实感觉到她开始对一些事情感到高兴了——很多事情。您知道她以前从没有这样过。您自己也是这么说的。噢，彭德尔顿先生，我——现在不能离开她！”

房间里沉默了很长一段时间，只听得到壁炉里木头噼噼啪啪燃烧的声音。终于，男人开口了。

“好吧，波莉安娜，我知道了。你——现在不能离开她，”他说，“我不会问你了——再也不会了。”他说最后一个词的时候，声音低得几乎都听不见了，但波莉安娜还是听到了。

“噢，但是您还没听我把话说完呢，”她急切地提醒道，“有一件最值得您高兴的事可以做呢——真的有！”

“对我来说并没有，波莉安娜。”

“不，先生，就是对您的。您说过，只有一个——一个女人的手和心，或者一个孩子的出现才能成为一个家。我可以为您办到——一个孩子的出现——不是我，您知道的，是另外一个小孩。”

“我只想要你，不想要其他人！”一个懊恼的声音响起。

“但您会的——一旦您知道的话。您是那么善良，那么好！噢，想想那些棱镜还有金币，还有您攒下来给异教徒的那些钱，还有——”

“波莉安娜！”男人粗鲁地打断道，“再说一遍，不要再提这些无聊的事了！我已经跟你说了五六遍了。我没有为异教徒存钱，一辈子都没给他们寄过一个便士。听懂了吗！”

他抬起下巴，支撑起头，以为会看到波莉安娜眼睛里面——沮丧而失望的眼神。然而，出乎他意料的是，波莉安娜的眼睛里面既没有沮丧也没有失望，只有惊喜和喜悦。

“噢，噢！”她拍着手大叫，“我太高兴啦！就是，”她立马纠正道，很尴尬地红着脸说，“我不是说我不为那些异教徒感到难过，我只是情不自禁地为您不想要抚养那些印度小男孩而感到高兴，因为其他人会想要他们的。我高兴，是因为您这样就可以收留吉米·比恩啦。我知道您一定会收留他的！”

“收留——谁？”

“吉米·比恩啊。他就是‘出现的小孩’，您知道的呀。他也一定会很高兴来这儿的。当上周我刚告诉他，我远在西部的妇援会不愿意收留他时，他可失望了。但是现在——要是他知道这个消息——他一定会很高兴的！”

“他会高兴吗？哼，我可不会的，”男人下定了决心，“波莉安娜，这纯粹就是胡说！”

“您的意思不会是——你不想收留他？”

“我当然不会。”

“但他就是那个家里出现的可爱孩子啊，”波莉安娜断断续续地说，几乎快要掉眼泪了，“您不会感到孤独的——有了吉米在身边的话。”

“我倒是不怀疑这点，”男人回答说，“但——我想我还是喜欢一个人待着。”

就在这时，波莉安娜突然间想起了几周前南茜曾经跟她说过的事情。她抬起下巴愤愤不平地说：

“或许，您觉得一个出色的活生生的小男孩还比不上您藏在什么地方的破旧骷髅架吧。但我可不这么觉得！”

“骷髅架？”

“是啊，南茜说您在衣柜还是什么地方里藏着骷髅架。”

“唉，什么——”男人突然间把头往后一仰，大笑起来。他的笑声很大——大到让波莉安娜紧张地哭了起来。一见到波莉安娜这个样子，约翰·彭德尔顿立马坐直了身体，脸色变得严肃起来。

“波莉安娜，我想也许你是对的——比你自己知道的还要对，”他温和地说，“事实上，我也知道那个‘出色的活生生的小男孩’要比——我藏在衣柜里的骷髅架——好很多，但——大家并不总是愿意去做交换的。我们还是希望有——自己的骷髅架，波莉安娜。不过，你再跟我多讲一些关于这个出色的小男孩的事情吧。”然后，波莉安娜告诉了他很多有关吉米的事情。

也许是因为笑声涤荡了气氛，也许是因为波莉安娜嘴里急切讲出的关于吉米·比恩的悲惨故事打动了彭德尔顿已经变软的心肠，总之，那天晚上波莉安娜回家的时候带上了一封写给吉米·比恩的邀请信，邀请他下周六下午同波莉安娜一起到大宅子做客。

“我真是太高兴了，我肯定您一定会喜欢他的，”波莉安娜告别时，舒了一口气说，“我真的好想给吉米·比恩一个家啊——有亲人照看的那种，您知道的。”





第二十二章　布道和木柴箱


就在波莉安娜向约翰·彭德尔顿讲述吉米·比恩的那天下午，保罗·福特牧师爬上了山，走进了彭德尔顿森林，希望上帝在户外营造的寂静之美能够平息他的信徒所制造的喧嚣。

保罗·福特牧师的心里很乱。在过去的一年里，月复一月，他负责的教区变得越来越糟糕。到现在为止，不管他用什么办法，遇到的还是只有持续不断的争吵、背后的恶言中伤、到处散布的流言蜚语，还有嫉妒的心。他辩论过、请求过、指责过，也选择性忽视过。他总是用尽气力地祈祷——虔诚而充满希望。但时至今日，他不得不可悲地承认，事情不仅没有变好，反而愈加糟糕了。

他的两名执事因为一件芝麻大点的小事而剑拔弩张，毫无缘由地无休止地争吵；他最富有活力的三位女助理因为一点流言蜚语的星星之火被逐步煽动成熊熊燃烧的丑闻后而退出了妇援会社团；唱诗班则因为分给一位广受欢迎的歌手独唱曲目的分量不公而分崩离析。即便是基督教勉励合会也因为对于其两位公职人员的公开指责而动荡不安。至于主日学校——一名主管和两位老师的离职，成为了压垮牧师的最后一根稻草，让这位心力交瘁的牧师不得不来到这片静谧的林子里祈祷、沉思。

在葱茏绿树的环抱下，保罗·福特牧师坦承地面对了这些事情。在他看来，危机已经来了，是该做点什么了——必须马上行动。教堂的所有工作都已经停滞了。礼拜日的仪式、平日的祷告聚会、慈善茶会，甚至连晚餐还有社交联谊都越来越疏于管理。没错，一些尽职尽责的工作人员还没有离开，但他们经常各自为政，而且总是对周遭指指点点的目光非常敏感，对莫须有的流言蜚语非常在意。

也正是这个原因，保罗·福特牧师非常清楚地知道，他（上帝的牧师）、教堂、小镇，甚至基督教本身都在历经考验，而且前方一定还有更多的考验，除非——

是时候做些什么了，立即就得做。但是要怎么做呢？

牧师慢慢地从口袋里掏出他为下个礼拜日布道写的演讲稿，皱着眉头看着它们，嘴唇闭成了一条严肃的曲线。他大声而富有激情地朗诵起他决定要说的这些文字：

“‘你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们正当人前，把天国的门关了。自己不进去，正要进去的人，你们也不容他们进去。’

“‘你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们侵吞寡妇的家产，假意做很长的祷告，所以要受更重的刑罚。’

“‘你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们将薄荷、茴香、芹菜献上十分之一，那律法上更重的事，就是公义、怜悯、信实，反倒不行了。这更重的是你们当行的，那也是不可不行的。’”



这是一段激烈的谴责。牧师低沉的声音回荡在森林绿荫小径的上空，严厉而肃穆。即便是小鸟和松鼠好像也吓得不敢出声了。这让牧师清楚地意识到下礼拜日神圣肃静的教堂里他要在教徒面前讲这些话将会产生何种意义深长的效果。

他的教徒！——他们是他的教徒。他能够这样做吗？他敢这样做吗？他敢不这样做吗？这是一段令人生畏的谴责，即便没有后面他要说的那些话——那些他自己的话。他不停地祈祷，一遍又一遍，他虔诚地祈求帮助和引导。他渴望——噢，他是多么地渴望！——在危机之中走对这一步。但是这——这一步走得对吗？

牧师慢慢把演讲稿折起来，放回衣服口袋。然后，他呜咽般叹了口气，扑在一棵树的脚下，用双手捂住了脸。

正是在这儿，刚从彭德尔顿山庄回家的波莉安娜瞧见了这一幕。她轻轻叫了一声，赶忙飞奔过来。

“噢，噢，福特先生！您——您没有把腿摔坏吧——或者是什么其他的？”她气喘吁吁地问。

牧师把手垂了下来，连忙抬起了头，勉强笑了笑。

“没有，亲爱的——一点事也没有！我只是——只是在休息。”

“噢，”波丽安娜舒了一口气，往后退了一下，“那就好。您知道，上次我见到彭德尔顿先生的时候，他就摔坏了腿——不过他是躺着的，而您是坐着的。”

“是的，我坐着呢，也没有摔坏什么——那些医生能修补的东西。”

“修补”这个词牧师说得很轻，但波丽安娜还是听到了。她脸上的表情一下子就变了，眼睛里流露出温柔的同情。

“我知道您的意思——您遇到了一些麻烦。爸爸也经常有那种感觉，而且很多次呢。我想牧师就是这样的——大部分都是这样的。有太多事需要他们来解决了。”

保罗·福特牧师惊异地转过身来。

“你的爸爸也是牧师吗，波莉安娜？”

“是的，先生。您还不知道啊？我以为大家都知道了呢。他娶了波莉姨妈的姐姐，也就是我的妈妈。”

“噢，我了解了。你是知道的，我在这儿还没有几年，所以并不是对每户人家的事情都了如指掌。”

“是的，先生——我的意思是，您确实不知道。”波丽安娜微笑道。

两个人沉默了很久。牧师还坐在树下，看起来好像已经忘记了波莉安娜的存在。他从口袋里拿出那些纸，把它们打开，但眼睛并没有往上面看，而是盯着不远处地上的一片叶子——一片又枯又黄，一点都不好看的叶子。波丽安娜看着他，隐约有些为他感到难过。

“今天——今天天气不错啊。”她心怀希望地打破沉默。

一段时间没有得到应答。突然，牧师抬起了头。

“什么？噢！——是的，今天天气不错。”

“而且一点都不冷，虽说都十月了呢，”波莉安娜更加满怀希望地接过话茬儿，“彭德尔顿先生家里壁炉生了火，但他说他并不冷，纯粹是为了好看。我喜欢看火苗的样子，您呢？”

这一次仍然没有回答，尽管波莉安娜耐心地等了好久，她决定再试一下——换一个新话题试试。

“您喜欢当牧师吗？”

这一次，保罗·福特牧师立马抬起了头。

“你问我喜欢——哎，多奇怪的问题啊！亲爱的，你为什么要这么问我呢？”

“没什么啊——您的样子让我想起了爸爸。他曾经也看起来像您这样——有的时候。”

“是吗？”牧师的声音非常有礼貌，但目光又回到了地上那片干枯的叶子上。

“是的，我也常常问他，就像我刚才问您那样，问他当牧师高兴吗？。”

树下的男人苦涩地笑了笑。

“好吧——那他怎么说的？”

“噢，当然，他总是说他很高兴，但他也总是说，如果没有那些‘快乐经’的话，那他一分钟牧师都不愿意当。”

“什——么？”保罗·福特牧师的目光离开了树叶，讶异地盯着波莉安娜快乐的小脸。

“好吧，爸爸习惯这么称呼它们。”她笑着说，“《圣经》上当然不是这么叫的。但是，里面很多话都是以‘因耶和华欢喜”“常常喜乐”，或者“应当欢呼”这种来开头的。您知道——这样的话还有很多。有一次，爸爸感到特别伤心，便数了数，发现有八百多句呢。”

“八百句！”

“是啊——这些话是告诉人们要开心和要快乐。因此爸爸就把它们列为‘快乐经’啦。”

“噢！”牧师的脸上浮现出奇怪的表情，他的眼睛盯住了手上文字的第一页——“你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！”他低声说，“所以你的爸爸——很喜欢那些‘快乐经’喽。”

“噢，是的，”波莉安娜强调地点点头，“他说第一天数这些话的时候，他立马感觉好多了。还说如果上帝不厌其烦地告诉我们八百多遍要开心和快乐，他一定是很希望我们做到——或者做一些这样的事情。爸爸为自己没能够做得更多而感到很遗憾。从那之后，那些话就被爸爸用来安抚自己的心，您知道，特别当事情变得糟糕的时候，当妇援会闹得不可开交的时候——我是说当那些女士对一些事情表示不同意的时候，”波莉安娜立马纠正说，“啊，爸爸还说，也就是这些话让他想到了这个游戏——他跟我从拐杖上开始玩这个游戏——是‘快乐经’让他开始玩这个游戏的。”

“那这是什么游戏呢？”牧师问。

“就是从每件事情中找到开心的事。就像我刚才说的，他是从一副拐杖开始跟我玩这个游戏的。”波莉安娜再次讲述了她的故事——这次是对这样一位有着温柔眼眸和善于倾听的人。

不一会儿，波莉安娜就和牧师一起手牵着手下山了。波莉安娜的脸上绽放着璀璨的光芒。她喜欢说话，并且她已经一直不停地说了好些时间：说着那牧师也想知道的无数个关于这个游戏、关于她的爸爸，还有她原来家乡生活的故事。

到了山脚，他们分开了。波莉安娜和牧师各往一个方向，独自前行。

那天晚上，保罗·福特牧师坐在书房里思考。在他旁边的书桌上散落着几页纸——全都是他的布道演讲稿。他手中握着铅笔，伏在另外几页空白的纸上——那是他将要撰写的布道演讲稿。但是，牧师既没有在思考他已经写就的文字，也没有在考虑他将要写的东西。他想象着，自己正身处于遥远的西部小镇，与一位贫病交加、忧心忡忡、几乎孤身一人活在这个世界上的传教士在一起——即便如此，这位传教士依然一心扑在《圣经》上，寻找着他的上帝有多少次告诉他要“高兴欢喜”。

过了一会儿，保罗·福特牧师长长地叹了一口气，如梦初醒，他将思绪从遥远的西部小镇拉了回来，整理了一下手中的几页纸。

“马太福音第23章第13节、第14节和第23节。”他在纸上写，但随即，又做了一个不耐烦的姿势，丢掉手中的铅笔，扯过几分钟前妻子留在桌上的一本杂志。他疲惫的目光随意地扫过一段又一段的文字，最终驻留在这段文字上：





“一天，汤姆拒绝帮助母亲把木柴箱装满。他的父亲对他说：‘汤姆，我敢保证你一定会很高兴帮妈妈搬一些木柴回来的。’汤姆什么也没有说就去了。为什么呢？仅仅是因为他的父亲很明确地表明了他希望儿子做正确的事情。设想一下，如果他说：‘汤姆，我听到你早上对妈妈说的话了，我为你感到羞耻。马上去把木柴箱装满！’我能保证，就汤姆的个性而言，那个木柴箱至今仍然会是空空的！”





牧师接着往下读——这儿读一个词，那儿读一行，然后又跳到另一段：





“男人和女人都需要鼓励。他们反抗的天性应该得到增强而不是削弱……反复地数落一个男人的缺点，不如指出他的优点。努力将他从坏习惯中拉出来。让他成就更好的自我，他勇于行动而成功的真正自我！……一个美丽、乐于助人、充满希望的性格是具有感染力的，也许能够改变整个城镇……人们所思所想都能够反映出来。如果一个人让人感到他很善良、很有礼貌，他周围的人不久也会变成这样。但如果一个人总是抱怨不断、愁容满面、横加指责，那么他周围的人也会变得更加怒气冲冲、横眉怒目！……如果你寻找糟糕的事物，期待它，那么你就会得到它。当你明白你在寻找美好的事物——你也会得到它……告诉你的儿子汤姆，跟他说他会很高兴去装满木柴箱——看着他开始做，兴致勃勃地去做！”





牧师放下杂志，抬起下巴，瞬间站起身，在狭小的房间里踱来踱去。过了一会儿，他长长地舒了一口气，一下子坐在桌子旁边的椅子上。

“上帝在帮助我，我一定会做到的！”他轻轻地叫道，“我要告诉我所有的汤姆们，我知道他们将非常高兴去装满木柴箱！我要给他们一些工作去做，让他们满心欢喜地去做，没工夫管邻居的木柴箱！”接着，他拿起布道演讲稿，一下子撕成两半，扔到一边去。于是，椅子的一边落着“有祸了”，另一半落着“你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人”在他面前一张光滑的空白纸上，他用铅笔飞快地写着。上面，是他用黑线划掉的马太福音第23章第13节、第14节和第23节。

因此，在接下来的那个礼拜日，保罗·福特牧师的布道成为了名副其实的号角，每一个男人、女人还有孩子都听到了它的声音。它正是波莉安娜那闪亮的八百句话中的一句：





“你们义人应当靠耶和华欢喜快乐。你们心里正直的人，都当欢呼。”





第二十三章　一场事故


一天，应斯诺夫人之请，波莉安娜去奇尔顿医生的诊所询问一种斯诺夫人忘记了名字的药。恰巧，波莉安娜还从没有进到过奇尔顿医生的诊所里面呢。

“我还从没有来过您家里面呢！这就是您的家，对吗？”波莉安娜饶有兴致地东看看，西望望。

医生苦笑了一下。

“是的啊——差不多就是这样啦，”他一边回答，一边在手上的便签簿上写着什么，“但这真算不上是家啊，波莉安娜。他们仅仅是一些房间而已——不是家。”

波莉安娜点了点头，一副睿智的模样，眼睛流露出同情和理解的目光。

“我知道，需要女人的手和心，或者孩子的出现，才算得上是一个家，”她说。

“呃？”医生马上转过身。

“是彭德尔顿先生告诉我的。”波莉安娜点点头，继续说，“您知道，是他跟我说了有关女人的手和心，还有孩子出现的事。您为什么不去争取一个女人的手和心呢，奇尔顿医生？或者，也许您可以收养吉米·比恩——如果彭德尔顿先生不想要他的话。”

奇尔顿医生有点不自然地笑了笑。

“所以，彭德尔顿先生说，需要女人的手和心才能成为家。他是这么说的吗？”他回避了她的问题。

“是的，他也说他的房子也只是房子。您为什么不去争取呢，奇尔顿医生？”

“我为什么不——争取什么？”医生又转身回到了桌边。

“一个女人的手和心啊。噢——我给忘了。”波莉安娜脸上的表情一下子变得很痛苦，“我想我应该告诉您，波莉姨妈和彭德尔顿先生很久之前并没有相爱。所以，我们——我们不会去他那儿住了。您看，我告诉过您的——但我搞错了。我希望您没有跟别人提起过这事。”她不安地说完了这句话。

“没有——我没有告诉任何人，波莉安娜。”医生回答道，露出一丝尴尬的微笑。

“噢，那就好，”波莉安娜放松地舒了一口气，“您知道，我可只告诉了您一个人。我觉得彭德尔顿先生知道我告诉您了以后，那样子看上去太好笑了。”

“是吗？”医生的嘴角抽搐了一下。

“是的啊，他当然不希望很多人知道这事啊——尤其是这事不是实际情况。但是您为什么不去争取一个女人的手和心呢，奇尔顿医生？”

一阵沉默之后，医生非常严肃地说：

“它们不是只要争取就能够拥有的，小姑娘。”

波莉安娜若有所思地蹙了蹙眉。

“但我觉得您能得到。”她争辩道。这句讨好的话可没错。

“谢谢你，”医生眉飞色舞地笑了起来，随即，又变得严肃起来，“我觉得有些比你大的姑娘都不像你这么——自信。至少，她们看上去没有像你这么——体贴别人。”

波莉安娜又皱起了眉头，惊讶地睁大了眼睛。

“啊，奇尔顿医生，您的意思不会是——您跟彭德尔顿先生一样，曾经想努力得到一个人的手和心，然后——然后失败了，是吗？”

医生有点着急地站了起来。

“好了，好了，波莉安娜，不要再提那些了。不要让别人的烦心事弄得你的小脑瓜不得安生。我想你要快点回到斯诺夫人那儿去了。我已经把药名给你写下来啦，还有服用方法。还有别的事吗？”

波莉安娜摇了摇头。

“没有了，先生，谢谢您。”她冷静地说，转身向门口走去。走到走廊，她又转过身，脸上突然露出高兴的神色，说：“不管怎么样，我很高兴您想得到但没有得到的不是我妈妈的手还有心，奇尔顿医生。再见喽！”

事故发生在十月的最后一天。波莉安娜放学后正急匆匆地赶回家，穿过马路时，离飞速行驶的汽车还有一段相当安全的距离。

后来发生了什么没有人说得清。既没有人能说清事故为什么会发生，也没有人知道到底应该怪谁。总之，下午五点钟的时候，全身瘫软、不省人事的波莉安娜被送回了自己喜爱的小房间。脸色惨白的波莉姨妈和一直抽泣的南茜轻轻地帮她脱去衣服，把她放到了床上。正在村子里的沃伦医生，接到电话后急急忙忙乘坐另一辆汽车赶了回来。

医生到达后，将无关人员都赶出了那个安静的房间。

“你只要看看她姨妈那张脸，”南茜在花园里抽泣地对老汤姆说，“你只要看看她姨妈的脸，就知道才不是什么责任呢。如果只是出于责任的话，你的手才不会颤抖，你的眼神才不会看起来像是要阻挡死神一样。汤姆先生，才不会，才不会呢！”

“她伤得——严重吗？”老人的声音颤抖着。

“医生没有说，”南茜抽泣道，“她惨白惨白地躺在那儿，动也不动，好像快不行了。但波莉小姐说她不会死的——波莉小姐应该比别人更知道这个——她一直听着她的心跳和呼吸呢！”

“你不知道是什么东西撞到她的吗？——那个——那个——”老汤姆的脸气得抽搐起来。

南茜的嘴唇放松了一些。

“我想你可以叫它某个东西，汤姆先生，某个极其坚固的东西。可恶！想想这东西竟然撞倒了我们家的小姑娘！我一直都讨厌这个味道难闻的东西——讨厌，讨厌！”

“她伤到哪儿了？”

“我不知道，不知道，”南茜呜咽道，“她的头上有一小处伤口，但不是很严重——不是很严重——是波莉小姐说的。她还说她害怕伤到地下去了。”

老汤姆的眼中闪现出疑惑的目光。

“我想你说的是伤到内脏吧，南茜，”他干涩地问，“如果她真被伤到地下去了——就让那个汽车见鬼去吧！——但我想波莉小姐是不会用这个词的。”

“呃？好吧，我也不知道，不知道，”南茜呜咽道，转过头，离开了，“我好像忍受不了，等不到医生出来了。有点洗洗刷刷的活儿给我就好了——把最重的活儿都给我吧，我要做，我要做！”她大哭起来，双手拧在一起。

然而，即便医生已经离开了，南茜也没能告诉汤姆先生点什么。波莉安娜好像没有摔断骨头，伤口也不是很严重。但医生看上去非常严肃，缓缓地摇着头，说得过段时间才能知道。医生走后，波莉姨妈的脸看上去比之前更加苍白、更加紧绷了。病人还没有完全恢复意识，但目前她看上去就像是在以一种尽可能舒适的姿势休息着一样。已经请了一名训练有素的护士，晚上就会到。这就是全部的情况。南茜抽泣地回到厨房去了。

直到第二天午前，波莉安娜才恢复了意识。她睁开了眼睛，知道了自己现在身在何处。

“啊，波莉姨妈，发生了什么？现在不是白天吗？我为什么没有起床？”她叫道。“啊，波莉姨妈，我起不了床呢。”她呻吟道。她尝试起身，并没有成功，又倒回了枕头上。

“别，亲爱的，我就不会试着——现在还不行。”她的姨妈赶紧轻声安慰道。

“但发生了什么？为什么我起不来呢？”

波莉小姐用询问的目光望着窗边那个戴白色帽子的年轻女士——在波莉安娜视野之外——这个问题令人痛苦。

年轻的女士点点头。

“告诉她吧。”她的嘴唇动了动。

波莉小姐清了清喉咙，努力想把堵在喉咙里让她发不出声音的东西咽下去。

“你受伤了，亲爱的，昨晚被汽车撞了。但是现在已经没有什么大碍了。姨妈希望你好好休息，继续再睡一觉。”

“受伤了？噢，是的，我——我跑来着，”波莉安娜的眼睛露出些茫然，她将手举到额头，“啊，它——被包扎起来了——它受伤了！”

“是的，亲爱的，不过没有关系。只要——只要休息一下就好了。”

“但是，波莉姨妈，我觉得很不舒服，感觉很糟糕！我感觉我的腿——很奇怪——它们完全没有知觉——完全没有！”

波莉姨妈乞求地望了一眼护士的脸，费力站起来，逃离了房间。护士赶忙走上前来。

“看来现在你要跟我聊一聊喽，”她语调轻快地说，“我想是时候咱俩相互认识一下啦。我先来介绍一下我自己。我是亨特小姐，是来帮你的姨妈照顾你的。我让你做的第一件事，就是把这些白色的小药片吞下去。”

波莉安娜眼睛睁大了一些。

“但是我不想被照顾啊——我是说，不想被照顾那么长时间！我想起床，您知道的，我还得去上学呢。我明天能去上学吗？”

从波莉姨妈所站的窗户边，传来了一阵压抑的哭泣声。

“明天啊？”护士小姐愉快地笑了笑，“嗯，我还不能让你这么快就出去，波莉安娜小姐。来，先把这些小药片吃了吧。我们来看看它们会起什么作用。”

“好吧，”波莉安娜同意了，但又有点怀疑，“但我后天可得去上学——学校还有考试呢，您知道。”

不一会儿，她又说了一遍。她说到了学校，说到了汽车，还说到了她的头有多么的疼。但很快，在那些她吞下去的小药片的作用下，她的声音渐渐拖长，越来越弱，直至毫无声息。





第二十四章　约翰·彭德尔顿


波莉安娜“明天”没有去上学，“后天”也没有去。但她并没有意识到这些，除了在意识清醒的片刻她一直不停地问问题外。事实上，波莉安娜什么都没有意识到，直到一周以后，烧退了，疼痛也减轻了些，她才完全清醒过来。随即，人们又把发生的事情从头到尾跟她讲了一遍。

“所以，我是受伤了，并不是生病了，”听完之后，她舒了一口气，“啊，我可真高兴啊。”

“高——高兴，波莉安娜？”她的姨妈坐在床边问道。

“是啊，我宁愿像彭德尔顿先生那样摔了腿，也不愿像斯诺夫人那样一辈子残疾。您知道，摔的腿还可以康复，可一辈子的残疾就不行了。”

波莉小姐——关于摔断腿的事没发表任何评论——她突然站起来，走到小梳妆台前面。她一件接一件地拿起上面放着的东西看看，又一一把它们放下，一副漫无目的的样子，这可不像她平日的作风。不过，她的脸色却一点也不漫无目的，它是那么苍白，那么沮丧。

波莉安娜躺在床上，眨着眼睛望着天花板上舞动的彩带，那是从窗户棱镜里反射出来的太阳光芒。

“我很高兴我得的不是天花，”她心满意足地低声说，“那可比雀斑还要糟糕多了。我也很高兴得的不是百日咳——我得过百日咳的，那真是太可怕了——我还很高兴得的不是阑尾炎或者麻疹，那可是会传染的——我是说麻疹会传染——这样他们可不会让我待在这儿。”

“你看起来——看起来好像会对很多事情都感到高兴，亲爱的。”波莉姨妈结结巴巴地说，把手放在喉咙上，好像衣领太紧了似的。

波莉安娜轻轻笑起来。

“是啊。我一直在想这些事——很多的事——在我看彩虹的时候。我喜欢彩虹。彭德尔顿先生把那些棱镜给了我，我太高兴了！我还有很多值得高兴的事情没有说呢。我也不知道，但让我感到最高兴的是我受伤。”

“波莉安娜！”

波莉安娜又轻轻笑了起来。她明亮的眼睛望着姨妈。“呐，您看，自从我受伤以后，您已经叫了我好多次‘亲爱的’啦——您以前可没这样唤过我。我喜欢被人叫‘亲爱的’——我是说，被亲人这么叫。妇援会的有些人也会这么叫我，这当然很棒了，但是没有亲人这样叫我棒，比如像您这样。噢，波莉姨妈，您是我的亲人，我真是太高兴了！”

波莉姨妈没有回答。她又把手放在了喉咙上，眼中满含泪水。她转过身慌忙冲出门去，护士恰巧走了进来。





就在那天下午，南茜跑去找了老汤姆。他正在马厩里清洗马具。南茜的眼睛睁得大大的。

“汤姆先生，汤姆先生，猜猜发生了啥，”她气喘吁吁地说，“您估计一千年都猜不出来——肯定猜不出来，肯定！”

“那我就不猜了，”他不情愿地说，“我估计连十年都活不到了，你最好还是快点告诉我吧，南茜。”

“啊，那听好了。猜猜现在客厅里跟女主人在一起的人是谁？猜猜是谁？”

老汤姆摇了摇头。

“没人告诉我啊。”他说。

“我这不准备告诉你嘛。是——约翰·彭德尔顿！”

“你肯定？现在！你在开玩笑呢，姑娘。”

“我一点也没有开玩笑——我请他进来的——还有拐杖呢！跟他一块儿来的人现在正在门口等他呢。看上去他好像不再是那个从不跟人说话的暴躁老头儿了！想想吧，汤姆先生——他正在跟她说话呢！”

“啊，那又怎么样呢？”老人反问道，有点挑衅的语气。

南茜轻蔑地瞥了他一眼。

“就好像我知道的事情你都不知道一样！”她嘲笑道。

“呃？”

“噢，你可没必要装得这么无辜，”她装着很愤慨的样子，“——你一开始就弄得我晕头转向的！”

“你这啥意思啊？”

南茜透过开着的马厩门向房子那边瞥了一眼，向老人身边靠了靠。

“听着！你一开始就知道波莉小姐有过恋人，是吧？很好，有一天我以为我找到了两个和两个，合在一块儿就变成了四个。但现在却成了五个——不是四个，肯定不是！”

老人做了一个毫不感兴趣的姿势，转过身又继续干起活来。

“如果你想跟我说的话，你就说得简单点，”他恼火地说，“对于数字我向来不拿手。”

南茜哈哈大笑起来。

“好吧，是这样儿的，”她解释道，“我听到一些事儿，让我觉得他和波莉小姐是一对儿。”

“彭德尔顿先生！”老汤姆惊得直起腰来。

“是的。噢，我现在可算知道了，他才不是。他爱上的是那个可怜小女孩儿的妈妈。这也是为什么他想——先别管这个了，”她慌忙打住，想起了她答应过波莉安娜不跟别人提起彭德尔顿想让她住过去的事儿，“嗯，我也问过其他人关于他的事儿，发现他和波莉小姐断了交情好多年了。波莉小姐恨他就像毒药一样，因为在她十八还是二十岁的时候，有愚蠢的爱嚼舌根的人把他俩的名字配在了一块儿。”

“是啊，我也记得，”老汤姆点点头说，“是珍妮小姐拒绝他的追求、跟另外一个小伙子远走高飞三四年之后的事情。波莉小姐当然也是知道这事的，她感到很内疚，于是尽力对他好一些。也许是她做得有点过了头——她太恨那个把她姐姐带走的传教士。无论如何，有些人开始嚼舌根了，说她在追求他。”

“追求男人——她！”南茜禁不住插嘴道。

“我知道不是这样儿的，但是那些人不知道啊，”老汤姆说。“当然，没有哪个女孩有勇气忍受那样的话语。胆子再大也不可能。就在那个时候，她自己的恋人出现了，麻烦也随之而来。从那之后，她就像牡蛎一样一句话也不说，跟谁也不打交道，她的内心最深处似乎也变苦了。”

“是啊，我知道，后来我也听说了，”南茜回答道，“所以，我看到他出现在门口才会这么惊讶——她可是这么多年都没跟他说过话了啊！但我还是让他进来了，还告诉了波莉小姐。”

“那她怎么说？”老汤姆屏住了呼吸。

“什么也没有说——起初，她连动都没动，我还以为她没有听见呢。我刚想再重复一遍的时候，她回了我，就像这样：‘跟彭德尔顿先生说，我马上下去。’然后我就下去跟他说了。接着，我就出来告诉你啦。”南茜说完，又朝后面的房子瞥了一眼。

“噗！”老汤姆咕哝了一声，继续弯腰干起活来。

在哈灵顿大宅豪华的“会客厅”里，约翰·彭德尔顿先生并没有等很久，一阵急促的步伐就响了起来，波莉小姐来了。他刚想起身，波莉小姐就做了一个手势，让他不用站起来。但她没有向他伸出手，脸上依然冷冰冰的。

“我来是想见一见——波莉安娜。”他有些唐突地立即表明了来意。

“谢谢，她还是老样子。”波莉小姐说。

“那么——能告诉我一下她具体怎么样了吗？”这次，他的声音不再那么沉着了。

女人的脸上掠过一阵痛苦的抽搐。

“我不能，我也希望我能说得出来！”

“你的意思是——你也不清楚？”

“是的。”

“那么——医生怎么说？”

“沃伦医生好像——也很茫然。他与一位纽约的专家取得了联系，他们会马上安排会诊。”

“但是——但是你知道她伤到哪儿了吗？”

“头上有一处轻微的伤口，有一两处擦伤，还有——还有脊柱也受伤了，有可能会导致——臀部以下瘫痪。”

男人低声呻吟了一声。短暂的沉默后，他声音沙哑地问：

“那么波莉安娜——她怎么——怎么接受的呢？”

“她还不明白——一点也不明白——事情的真相。我不能告诉她。”

“但是她必须得知道——一些吧！”

波莉小姐将手放到喉咙上的领口处。这个姿势最近成了她常做的动作。

“噢，是的。她知道自己不能——动，但她认为她的腿是——摔坏了。她还说她很高兴像你一样摔坏了腿，而不是像斯诺夫人一样‘终身残疾’。因为摔坏的腿还能够好起来，但是终身残疾——没办法好起来。她一直不停地像这样重复着——弄得我好像都要——都要死掉了！”

男人的眼中盈满泪水，他清楚地看到对面那张因强烈的感情而扭曲的脸，下意识地回想起他最后一次请求波莉安娜时她说的话：“噢，我不能离开波莉姨妈——我是说现在！”

正是想到了这些，他才马上控制好自己的声音，温和地问：

“我想知道你是否知道，哈灵顿小姐，我多么努力地想让波莉安娜搬过来跟我一起住。”

“跟你一起！——波莉安娜！”

男人听到她的语气，一下子有点畏缩。但当他再开口的时候，声音依然非常冷静。

“是的，我想收养她——依照法律来收养，你明白的，让她做我的继承人。”

坐在对面椅子上的女人稍稍松了口气。她突然间意识到，这对于波莉安娜来说意味着多么光辉灿烂的未来——这样的收养。她也想知道，波莉安娜是否拥有足够大的年龄和金钱意识——来承受这个人所带来的金钱和地位的诱惑呢？

“我非常喜爱波莉安娜，”男人继续说，“我喜爱她，一方面是因为她自己的原因，另一方面也是因为——她母亲的原因。我已经准备好将这二十五年来封存的所有的爱都给波莉安娜。”

“爱。”波莉小姐突然想到一开始为什么会收留这个孩子——还有那天早上波莉安娜说的话：“我喜欢被自己的亲人叫‘亲爱的’！”正是这个渴望爱的小女孩被给予了封存了二十五年的爱——她的年纪已足够被爱诱惑了！想到这儿，波莉小姐的心一沉，意识到一些其他的事情：那些未来她失去了波莉安娜之后的沉闷乏味的日子。

“那么怎么样了呢？”她说。男人已经察觉到波莉小姐颤抖的声音中难以掩饰的自我控制，悲伤地笑了一下。“她不会来的。”他回答说。

“为什么？”

“她不会离开你的。她说你对她那么好，她想和你待在一块儿——她还说她觉得你也想让她留下来。”说完，彭德尔顿吃力地站起来。

他没有看波莉小姐，果断把脸转向门口。突然，他听到了一阵急促的脚步声，一只颤抖的手拽住了他。

“等专家来了，我要是知道了些什么——当然是有关波莉安娜的，我会告诉你的，”一个颤抖的声音说，“再见——谢谢你来看她。波莉安娜会很高兴的。”





第二十五章　一个等待的游戏


约翰·彭德尔顿来访后的第二天，波莉小姐就开始为专家的到来给波莉安娜“打预防针”。

“波莉安娜，亲爱的，”她温柔地说，“我们决定除了沃伦医生之外，再请一位医生来给你瞧瞧。这位医生可能会告诉我们一些新的法子——来帮助你好得更快。”

波莉安娜的脸上出现了高兴的笑容。

“奇尔顿医生！噢，波莉姨妈，我很愿意奇尔顿医生来！我一直都想让他来看我，但是我又怕您不肯，因为他那天看到了您在日光浴室里的样子，所以我就什么都没说。但我很高兴你终于想让他来啦！”

波莉姨妈的脸一阵白一阵红。

但当她回答波莉安娜问题的时候，还是尽力表现出了轻松和愉快。

“噢，不是的，亲爱的！不是奇尔顿医生呢。是一位新的医生——一位从纽约来的著名的医生，他——他知道很多——像你这样的情况。”

波莉安娜的脸色暗了下来。

“我觉得他知道的还没有奇尔顿医生知道的一半多呢。”

“噢，不，他知道的，我肯定，亲爱的。”

“但是奇尔顿医生治好了彭德尔顿先生的腿啊，波莉姨妈。如果——如果您不是非常介意的话，我想让奇尔顿医生来——我真的很想让他来！”

波莉姨妈的脸上蒙上了一层痛苦的表情。她沉默片刻后，温柔地说——尽管口气里还是带着惯有的那种严厉和不容置疑：

“但是我真的很介意，波莉安娜。我非常地介意。我可以做任何事情——几乎是任何事情，只要是为了你，亲爱的，但是我——我不希望奇尔顿医生来——给你看病，原因我现在还不能告诉你。相信我，对于你的——你的病情，他绝对没有明天从纽约来的这位医生知道的多。”

波莉安娜看上去还是不大相信。

“但是，波莉姨妈，如果您爱奇尔顿医生的话——”

“什么，波莉安娜？”波莉姨妈的声音突然变得很尖锐，脸颊通红通红的。

“我是说，如果您爱奇尔顿医生的话，而不是爱另外一位医生的话，”波莉安娜叹了口气，“在我看来，您就不会这么看了，他也会做得很好的。我爱奇尔顿医生。”

正说着，护士走进了房间。波莉姨妈如释重负般急忙站起身。

“我很抱歉，波莉安娜，”她有些固执地说，“但我恐怕这次你得让我做决定了。况且，这都是早就说好的事。纽约的医生明天就来。”

但是，真不巧，纽约的医生“明天”没有来。在最后一刻，一封电报发来，说专家自己突然生了病，不得不推迟行期。这又给了波莉安娜再一次请求奇尔顿医生代替纽约医生来看病的机会——“现在请哪一个医生更加容易，您知道的。”

跟先前一样，波莉姨妈依然摇着头说：“不行，亲爱的。”语气非常坚决，但她也更为急切地保证她会做任何事情——除了这一件——来让她亲爱的波莉安娜开心。

等待的日子一天天过去了，波莉姨妈真的做了所有力所能及的事情（除了那件事）来让外甥女开心。

“我真是不能相信——你也没法子让我相信，”一天早上，南茜对老汤姆说，“波莉小姐可真是分分钟不差地伺候着那小可怜呢。上个星期她说什么也不让小毛球和小黄狗上楼来呢，这会儿却让它们在床上打滚儿，就是为了让波莉安娜小姐开心呢！

“还有嘞，她没啥事儿的时候，就把那些玻璃做的小玩意儿挂在不同的窗户上，阳光就会让‘彩虹跳舞’，就像那个受上帝保佑的小孩说的。她还让蒂莫西去科布家的花棚买了三次鲜花——这还没算上那些采来的。那天，我还看见她坐在床前，让护士给她拾掇头发。波莉安娜小姐就在床上告诉她该怎么做，眼睛里面闪闪的，高兴极了。我保证，波莉小姐说不定会天天把头发梳成那个样子——就为了让那个受上帝保佑的小孩高兴呢！”

老汤姆咯咯地笑起来。

“嗯，我觉得波莉小姐看起来不能更难看了——额头上都是卷卷的头发。”他平静地说。

“当然不是这样啦，”南茜义愤填膺地反驳道，“她现在看上去可像咱们一样啦。她其实——”

“注意点噢，南茜！”老人打断道，笑着露出牙齿，“你还记得之前我跟你说她挺漂亮时，你说啥来着？”

南茜耸了耸肩。

“噢，当然，她是不怎么漂亮啊，但我得承认她看上去跟以前不一样了。她还戴上了波莉安娜小姐给她围在脖子上的缎带蕾丝围巾。”

“我已经告诉过你啦，”老人点点头，“我告诉过你她一点也不——老。”

南茜笑了起来。

“好吧，我得承认她没有波莉安娜小姐来之前那么会装老了。哎，汤姆先生啊，她的爱人到底是谁啊？我到现在还没有搞清楚呢。还没有，还没有呢！”

“你还没搞清楚？”老人问，脸上露出奇怪的神情，“好吧，我想我还是不告诉你了。”

“噢，汤姆先生，拜托，现在就告诉我吧，”女孩开始撒娇了，“您看，我在这儿也没有几个人能问啦。”

“也是。不过，这儿确实有那么一位，但他也不会告诉你的。”老汤姆咧嘴笑道。随即，他的目光黯淡下来：“她今天怎么样了——那小姑娘？”

南茜摇了摇头，脸色也变得严肃起来。

“还是老样子，汤姆先生，在我看来跟往常没有什么不一样的——其他人估计也看出来了。她就躺在那儿睡一会儿，说一会儿，一直努力微笑，为了太阳落下去，或者月亮升起来，或者其他什么类似的事儿感到‘高兴’。真是让人心都碎了。”

“我知道，是那个‘游戏’——愿上帝保佑她甜美的心灵吧！”老汤姆点点头，眼里有泪光隐隐闪烁。

“这么说的话，她也告诉过你那个——游戏喽？”

“噢，是的。很久之前她就告诉过我了。”老人迟疑着，嘴角抽搐了一下，继续说道，“有一天我因为自己驼背这么厉害而不停抱怨，你猜这个小家伙怎么说？”

“我猜不出来。我可不觉得她能找到什么值得高兴的！”

“她还真找到了。她说我无论如何也应该高兴，因为我不用再使劲弯腰来除草了，因为我已经弯了一半了。”

南茜若有所思地笑了笑。

“好吧，我可一点也不惊讶。你知道的，她总会找到高兴的事儿。我们一直都在玩——这个游戏——一开始就一起玩，因为没有其他人跟她一起玩——尽管她倒是提到过——她的姨妈。”

“波莉小姐！”

南茜咯咯地笑起来。

“我猜你对女主人看法的转变可没我大吧。”她抬起头，有点轻蔑地说。

老汤姆有点生气了。

“我只是觉得这——有点让人惊讶——对于她来说。”他神气十足地解释道。

“好吧，是的，我也觉得——当时是这样的，”南茜回应道，“我现在可不会这么说了。我现在相信女主人啥事儿都能做——她自己都玩起这个游戏了呢！”

“是小姑娘告诉她的吗？我猜她已经告诉每一个人了吧。自从她受伤以来，我现在到处都能听到有人提起这个游戏呢。”汤姆说。

“呃，她可没有告诉波莉小姐，”南茜说，“很久之前，波莉安娜小姐告诉我她没法跟姨妈说，因为姨妈不喜欢她提到她爸爸。这是她爸爸的游戏，所以如果她要告诉姨妈这个游戏，就不能不提她爸爸。所以她从来没有告诉波莉小姐。”

“噢，我知道，我知道。”老人慢慢地点点头，“他们都讨厌那个传教士小伙子——所有人都不喜欢他，因为他带走了珍妮小姐。波莉小姐——那时候她还很小——永远不会原谅他。曾经她是那么地喜欢珍妮小姐。我知道的，我知道的。真是太糟糕了。”他叹了口气，转身走开了。

“是啊，确实是——没一件好事儿，没一件。”南茜也叹了口气，回厨房去了。

这些日子里，没有人能心情平静地等待。护士小姐强装笑脸，可是眼睛却出卖了她；医生则明显表现出紧张和焦虑。波莉小姐不怎么说话，但即便是搭在脸上柔软的卷发和高到嗓子口的花边也无法掩盖她逐渐消瘦、日渐苍白的事实。至于波莉安娜——她摸着小狗的头，顺着小猫光滑的脑袋，赏着花，吃着送来给她的水果和果冻，无数次兴高采烈地回答着那些床边充满爱意的询问和问候，但也变得日渐苍白和消瘦，她那瘦弱的手掌和臂膀强有力地挥动着，映衬着如今一动不动地躺在毯子下面的曾经活力十足的小脚和小腿，显得更加可怜。

至于那个游戏——波莉安娜告诉南茜，说这些天她是多么地高兴，因为她将回到学校去，将去看斯诺夫人，将去拜访彭德尔顿先生，将和奇尔顿医生一块儿坐马车。她好像并没有意识到，这些“高兴的事”都是将来的，而不是现在。但南茜是知道的——当她独自一人时常常为此黯然落泪。





第二十六章　一扇半开的门


米德医生，那位专家，比预计抵达的时间晚了一周。他是一个高个子、宽肩膀的男人，有着一双和善的灰色眼睛，脸上带着愉悦的笑容。波莉安娜刚一见到他，就立马喜欢上了他，并且把这点告诉了他。

“您看上去好像我的医生啊，您知道吗？”她深情款款地说。

“你的医生？”米德医生惊讶地瞥了一眼正在几英尺外跟护士说话的沃伦医生。沃伦医生个子矮小，有着棕色的眼睛，蓄着尖尖的棕色胡子。

“噢，那位不是我的医生呢，”波莉安娜发现了他的疑惑，微笑着解释道，“沃伦医生是波莉姨妈的医生。我的医生是奇尔顿医生。”

“噢——噢！”米德医生说，语气有点奇怪。他的目光停留在波莉小姐身上，只见她脸唰地一下红了，慌忙走开了。

“是的，”波莉安娜迟疑了一下，用她一贯的率直继续说道，“您知道，我一直都想请奇尔顿医生来，但是波莉姨妈想请您来。她说，关于——关于像我这种摔坏的腿，您知道的要比奇尔顿医生多。当然，如果你真的是这样的话，我会很高兴的。你是吗？”

医生的脸上有东西快速闪过，波莉安娜刹那间还没明白。

“只有时间能说明一切了，小姑娘。”他温柔地说，然后神情严肃地转向刚刚走到床边的沃伦医生。





后来，人们都说，要怪就怪那只猫。当然，如果小毛球没用爪子和鼻子一直去挠那扇没插上门闩的门，它就不会消无声息地打开一英尺的缝隙；如果门没有被打开，波莉安娜就不会听到姨妈的话。

在大厅里，两位医生，护士小姐，还有波莉小姐正站着说话。而在波莉安娜的房间里，小毛球刚刚兴奋地喵喵叫着，跳上了床。就在这时，波莉姨妈痛苦的尖叫清晰而尖锐地穿过虚掩的门传到了波莉安娜的耳朵里。

“不会的！医生，不会的！您的意思不会是——这孩子——再也不能走路了！”

接着是一片混乱。一开始，是卧室里传来波莉安娜惊恐的叫声“波莉姨妈——波莉姨妈！”紧接着，波莉小姐看到了半开的门，意识到波莉安娜听到了她的话，低低地呻吟了一声，然后——她生平第一次——昏了过去。

护士小姐哽咽着说了句“她听到了”，就跌跌撞撞地跑向那扇半开的门。两位医生守着波莉小姐。米德医生不得不守着——因为波莉小姐晕倒的时候，他扶住了她。而沃伦医生则无助地站在一旁。直到波莉安娜又一次发出尖叫，护士关上了房门，两位医生这才绝望地互相望了一眼，立马意识到有责任把米德医生臂弯中的女人唤回到痛苦的意识中来。

在波莉安娜的房间里，护士看到床上有一只灰猫，正喵喵叫着试图引起那个脸色苍白、双眼大瞪的小女孩的注意，却只是徒劳。

“亨特小姐，求您了，我想要波莉姨妈。我想要她来，马上，求您了！”

护士小姐关上房门，快速走上前去。她的脸色也非常苍白。

“她——她这会儿还来不了，亲爱的。她——过一会儿会来的。怎么了？我能——能帮你吗？”

波莉安娜摇摇头。

“但是我想知道她——刚才说的话是什么意思。您听到她说什么了吗？我想要波莉姨妈——她说了一些什么。我想让她告诉我这不是真的——不是真的！”

护士小姐想开口，却没说出话来。她脸上的神色进一步加重了波莉安娜眼睛里的恐惧。

“亨特小姐，您肯定听到她的话了！这是真的！噢，这是真的！您是不是说我再也——再也不能走路了吗？”

“好啦，好啦，亲爱的——别这样，别这样！”护士小姐哽咽了，“也许他并不清楚，也许他弄错了呢。这是有很多可能性的，你知道的啊。”

“但是波莉姨妈说他是清楚情况的！她说他比任何人知道的都多——像我这样摔坏腿的情况！”

“是的，是的，我知道，亲爱的，但是医生有时候都会出点岔子什么的。现在就——就不要再想这些了，不要再想了，亲爱的。”

波莉安娜疯狂挥舞着她的手臂。“但是我没法子不想啊，”她抽泣道，“都这样子了。啊，亨特小姐，那我怎么去学校，怎么去看彭德尔顿先生，还有斯诺夫人，还有——还有其他人啊？”她刹那间失声痛哭起来。过了一会儿，她突然止住哭泣，抬起头，眼睛里面充满新的恐惧：“啊，亨特小姐，如果我没法子走路的话，我该怎样才能对——任何事情都感到高兴呢？”

亨特小姐并不知道这个“游戏”，但却知道自己的病人必须得立刻安静下来。尽管她自己心里也非常痛苦不安，但她的手却没闲着。现在，她已经拿着镇静剂站在床边了。

“来，来，亲爱的，把这个吃下去，”她安慰道，“咱们先休息一下，然后再看看能做些什么。很多时候，事情还不及看上去的一半来得糟糕呢，你知道的呀。”

波莉安娜听话地把药吃了，又小口小口地喝下了亨特小姐手中递过来的水。

“我知道，就好像爸爸以前经常说的那样，”波莉安娜眨着眼睛挤走眼泪，断断续续地说，“他说每件糟糕的事情里面总有一些不那么糟糕的东西，但我觉得那是他从没有听到别人说你再也不能走路了。我没看出来这里面还能有什么不那么糟糕的东西——您能吗？”

亨特小姐没有回答。她那时没有勇气让自己开口。





第二十七章　两次拜访


是南茜把米德医生的诊断告诉约翰·彭德尔顿先生的。波莉小姐并没有忘记她对彭德尔顿的承诺，要把宅子里的消息及时告诉他。对她而言，自己亲自去，或者写封信去都是几乎不可能的，于是她想到派南茜去跑一趟。

要是以前的话，有这么难得的机会去探一探神秘大宅和它的主人，南茜指不定得多高兴呢。但今天，她的心情格外沉重，对什么事情都提不起兴趣来。甚至，在等待约翰·彭德尔顿先生的那几分钟里，她都没顾得上看一眼四周。

“我是南茜，先生，”看到走进来的彭德尔顿眼睛里写满疑惑，南茜毕恭毕敬地回答道，“哈灵顿小姐派我来告诉您有关——波莉安娜小姐的事情。”

“怎么样了？”

这虽然是一句非常简短的话，但南茜却清楚地明白隐匿在这一句简短的“怎么样了”后面的焦灼不安。

“情况不是太好，彭德尔顿先生。”她抽泣地说。

“你的意思不会是——”他停住了，南茜痛苦地低下了头。

“是的，先生。他说——她再不能走路了——永远都不能走路了。”

刹那间，房间里寂然无声。过了一会儿，男人用激动得发抖的声音说：“可怜的——小——女孩！可怜的——小——女孩！”

南茜瞥了他一眼，马上又把目光垂了下去。她没想到这个平日里尖酸刻薄、脾气暴躁、冷酷无情的约翰·彭德尔顿居然会变成这个样子。过了一会儿，他又开口了，仍然是那种低沉、颤抖的声音。

“这太残忍了——再也不能在阳光下跳舞了！我的棱镜小女孩！”

又是一阵沉默过后，男人突然问：

“但她自己应该不知道吧——肯定不知道吧——对吗？”

“她已经知道了，先生，”南茜抽泣着说，“所以，事情变得更难办了。她已经听到了——都怪那只混蛋的猫！抱歉，”女孩赶紧道歉，“就是因为那只猫把门打开了，波莉安娜小姐才听到了他们的谈话。这样，她就全都知道了。”

“可怜的——小——女孩！”男人又开始叹气。

“是的，先生。如果您要是见着她，肯定还得这么说，”南茜哽咽道，“自从她知道了这件事儿之后，我就见过她两次，每次都让我心碎。您知道的，所有的一切对她来说都是新奇的，她一直在想那些现在她再也不能做的新奇事儿。她非常担心，因为她再也高兴不起来了——也许您还不知道她那个游戏吧。”南茜歉意地掐断了自己话。

“那个‘高兴游戏’吗？”男人问道，“噢，知道，她跟我说过了。”

“噢，她告诉您了。好吧，我猜她已经跟大部分的人都说过了。可是您看，现在她——她自己都玩不起来了。这让她很担心。她说她从再也不能走路这档子事儿上找不到一件能让她开心的事儿——一件都找不到。”

“唔，她为什么非要这样？”男人有点焦躁地问道。

南茜不安地倒腾着两只脚。

“我也这么觉得呢——直到我突然想到——如果她能找到一些开心的事儿，情况也许会容易一些，您知道的。所以我就尽量——尽量提醒她。”

“提醒她！提醒她什么？”约翰·彭德尔顿的声音愤怒而急躁。

“提醒——提醒她以前是怎么告诉别人玩这个游戏的。像斯诺夫人，还有其他人，您知道的——提醒她是怎么跟别人说的。但是这个可怜的小羊羔只是哭，说这并不一样。她说告诉一个终身残疾的人如何高兴并不是件难事儿，但是要这事儿摊在自己身上，那可就不一样了，得使劲儿地去找。她还说，她跟自己一遍又一遍地说，其他人没有像她这样，她应该感到高兴，但是每次这么说的时候，她实际上没有在想任何事，只想到自己怎么就再也不能走路了。”

南茜停住了，但男人并没有开口说话。他坐在那儿，用手捂住了眼睛。

“然后我就尽量提醒她，她从前是怎么说的来着——这个游戏越难就——越好玩。”南茜继续说道，声音苍白而无力，“但她也说那不一样——当这个游戏确实很难很难的时候。我得走了，先生。”这时候，她突然中断了话语。

走到门口的时候，她犹豫了一下，转身小心翼翼地问道：

“我是不是可以告诉波莉安娜小姐您——您已经又见过吉米·比恩了呢，先生？”

“我不知道你是不是可以告诉她——因为我还没有见他，”男人简短地回答，“怎么了？”

“没什么，先生，只是——好吧，您知道，这是其中一件她感觉不好的事儿，因为她现在没法带他来见您了。她说她带他来过一次的，但是她觉得那天他表现得不好，怕您觉得他不是一个出色的好孩子。或许您知道她的意思吧，先生，反正我不是很明白。”

“是的，我知道——她的意思。”

“那就好，先生。她总是想再带他来一次，告诉您他真的是那种出色的乖孩子。但现在，她——没法做到了——那该死的汽车！抱歉，先生。再见了！”说罢，南茜匆匆忙忙地离开了。

没过多长时间，整个贝尔丁斯维尔小镇就传遍了有关那位不一般的纽约医生说波莉安娜·惠提尔再也不能走路的消息。小镇可从没有像现在这样被搅得灼灼不安。人们都见过那张长着雀斑、但总是挂着微笑的活泼的小脸蛋；几乎每个人都知道波莉安娜正在玩的那个“游戏”。想想吧，再也不能在街上看到那张微笑的小脸——再也听不到那欢快稚嫩的声音来诉说平常小事中的各种快乐！这真是令人难以置信，真是残酷至极！

厨房里、客厅里、后院的篱笆边，女人们谈论着，公然流下眼泪；在街角、商店的咖啡厅，男人们也谈论着，暗自啜泣。而南茜令人同情的讲述更是让这些谈论和泪水愈加汹涌，她说波莉安娜悲伤地发现自己没法再玩这个游戏、也不再对任何事情感到高兴。

波莉安娜的朋友们都有着同样的感受。几乎在同一时间，哈灵顿大宅的女主人万分惊讶地迎来了各种拜访。这些拜访有她认识的人们，也有不认识的；有男人、女人还有孩子们——这其中有很多人波莉小姐丝毫没有料到她的外甥女竟然会认识。

有些访客来了，拘谨地坐上五分钟或十分钟；有些男人或女人则木木地站在门廊的台阶上，笨拙地玩弄着帽子和手提包；有些带来了一本书、一束花或者一份诱人的美味；有些则放声大哭；还有一些转过身使劲地吸着鼻涕。所有的人都焦急地询问这个受伤小女孩的情况，他们都为她带来了一些消息——后来也正是这些消息，促使波莉小姐开始做点什么了。

第一位访客是约翰·彭德尔顿先生。这天他来的时候没有用拐杖。

“我想不需要告诉你我是多么地震惊了，”他几近刺耳地开口道，“但是真的——真的什么都做不了了吗？”

波莉小姐做了一个绝望的手势。

“噢，我们‘正在做’，一直都在做。米德医生采取了一些治疗方法，开了一些药，也许会有一些效果，沃伦医生正严格地按照方案执行，但米德医生觉得没有什么希望。”

约翰·彭德尔顿突然就站起来要离开——他才刚刚到这呢。他的脸色苍白，嘴唇紧紧闭成严峻的线条。波莉小姐看着他，心里面非常清楚为何他在她面前不能再待下去了。走到门口，他转过身。

“我给波莉安娜带来一个消息，”他说，“请你告诉她，我已经见过吉米·比恩了——他从此以后就成为我的儿子了。请告诉她，我想她——知道这件事情会很高兴的。我应该会收养他。”

一下子，波莉小姐失去了一贯颇具涵养的自控力。

“你要收养吉米·比恩！”她气都快喘不上来了。

男人抬了抬下巴。

“是的，我想波莉安娜会明白的。请告诉她我想她会——高兴的！”

“啊，当——当然。”波莉小姐顿顿地说。

“谢谢你。”约翰·彭德尔顿朝她欠了欠身，转身离开了。

波莉小姐呆在房间中央，惊讶地说不出话来，目光还停留在刚刚那个男人离开的方向。即便这样，她还是无法相信自己的耳朵听到了什么。约翰·彭德尔顿要收养吉米·比恩？约翰·彭德尔顿，那个腰缠万贯、独来独往、孤僻乖戾、吝啬小气、极度自私的人，竟然会收养一个小男孩——还是这样一个小男孩？

波莉小姐一头雾水地上楼走进了波莉安娜的房间。

“波莉安娜，约翰·彭德尔顿先生让我给你捎个信。他刚刚到这儿来过。他让我告诉你，他要让吉米·比恩做他的儿子。他说他认为你会很高兴知道这事的。”

波莉安娜郁闷的小脸一下子就迸出欢喜的神情。

“高兴？高兴？啊，我想我的确很高兴！噢，波莉姨妈，我极其盼望给吉米找一个家——还是这么可爱的家！我也为彭德尔顿先生感到高兴。您知道，现在他将会有那个孩子的存在。”

“那个——什么？”

波莉安娜脸蒙上了痛苦的颜色。她忘了她还没有跟姨妈说过彭德尔顿先生想收养她的事呢——现在当然更不愿意告诉她了，她从没想过要离开她——这位亲爱的波莉姨妈！

“那个出现的孩子，”波莉安娜急忙结结巴巴地回应道，“彭德尔顿先生曾经告诉过我，就是，只有一个女人的手和心或者一个孩子的出现才能组成一个——一个家。现在他已经得到了——一个孩子出现了。”

“噢，我——知道了。”波莉姨妈温柔地说。她也确实明白了——远远超过波莉安娜所意识到的东西。她知道了当约翰·彭德尔顿想把那堆灰色的大石头变成家而邀请波莉安娜做他“出现的孩子”时，波莉安娜承受了多么大的压力。“我知道了。”她说完，泪水刺痛了双眼。

波莉安娜害怕姨妈再问一些别的令人尴尬的问题，于是快速把交谈的内容从彭德尔顿山庄和它的主人身上转移开。

“奇尔顿医生也这么说——只有女人的手和心，或者一个孩子的出现才能组成一个家，您知道的。”她说。

波莉小姐终于开始回应了。

“奇尔顿医生！你怎么知道——他这么说？”

“他告诉我的呀。他说他现在住的只能叫房子，您知道——不是家。”

波莉小姐没有回答，她把目光投向了窗外。

“所以我问他为什么不努力去争取——一个女人的手和心，来拥有一个家。”

“波莉安娜！”波莉小姐猛地转身，脸颊突然红了起来。

“嗯，我就是问了啊。他看上去——看上去难过极了。”

“那他说了——说了什么？”波莉小姐问这个问题的时候，好像心里面有股巨大的力量阻止她问出口似的。

“他一开始什么也没有说。过了一会儿，他才用非常低沉的声音说，它们不是只要你争取就能够拥有的。”

一阵短暂的沉默。波莉小姐的目光又一次转向窗外，脸颊上依然是那么不自然的红晕。

波莉安娜叹了口气。

“不管怎么样，我是知道的，他想得到一个人。我也希望他能得到一个人。”

“为什么，波莉安娜，你是怎么知道的？”

“因为后来，有一天他跟我说了一些事情，还是用那种低沉的声音，但是我还是听到了。他说如果他能够得到一个女人的手和心的话，他愿意用整个世界来交换。怎么了，波莉姨妈，有什么问题吗？”波莉姨妈匆忙站起来，走到了窗前。

“没什么，亲爱的。我来把这些棱镜换个位置。”波莉姨妈说。她的脸已经红得发烫了。





第二十八章　游戏以及它的玩家们


就在约翰·彭德尔顿第二次来访后不久的一天下午，米莉·斯诺就登门了。米莉·斯诺以前从没来过哈灵顿大宅，看到波莉小姐走进房间的时候，她的脸一下子就红了，看上去十分尴尬。

“我——我来问问那个小女孩的情况。”她结结巴巴地说。

“谢谢。她还是老样子。你妈妈怎么样了？”波莉小姐疲倦地说。

“这正是我来要告诉您的——就是，请您告诉波莉安娜小姐，”女孩急匆匆的样子，有些语无伦次，她上气不接下气地说，“我们觉得小家伙再也不能走路，这——太可怕了——真的太可怕了。她为我们做了那么多的事——为妈妈，您知道，她教她玩那个游戏，还有其他的事。我们听说现在她自己都玩不了那个游戏了——可怜的小家伙！我知道，她现在这种情况，真是不知道该怎么玩了！——但是我们都记得她跟我们说的话。我们觉得如果她能知道她为我们做的那些事，您知道，也许能够帮助她重新拾起那个游戏，因为那样她会高兴——也许会有一点点高兴——”米莉停下来，很无助的样子，好像在等待波莉小姐开口。

波莉小姐礼貌性地坐着听完，眼睛里却充满疑惑。米莉刚刚说的话，她只听懂了差不多一半。一直以来，她都觉得米莉·斯诺有点古怪，但现在她琢磨着这孩子是不是有点疯了。她无论如何也找不到别的方式来表述这段断断续续、杂乱无章，毫无意义的鲁莽言辞。片刻停顿后，她平静地说道：

“我觉得我不是很明白你的话，米莉。你到底想让我告诉我外甥女什么呢？”

“是的，就是这个，我想请您转告她，”女孩激动地回答说，“让她瞧瞧她为我们大伙儿做了什么。当然，有些事情她是知道的，因为当时她也在那儿，她知道妈妈不一样了。但是我还想让她知道不仅是妈妈——还有我。我也变得不一样了，我也在努力去玩——那个游戏——虽然还不是很熟练。”

波莉小姐蹙了蹙眉。她本来想问问米莉说的“那个游戏”到底是什么意思，但是没逮到机会。米莉依旧一句赶一句地说个不停。

“您知道妈妈以前觉得没有什么事是对的，她总是想要不同的东西。当然，我也不知道——像她这样的情况，还有谁会因为这些而责怪她。但是现在，她让我拉开窗帘，开始对很多事情产生了兴趣——她的外貌、她的睡衣，等等。而且她竟然开始编织一些小东西了——像绳子啊、还有婴儿毯子什么的，还把它们拿到集市或者医院里去卖。她对这些事非常感兴趣而且很高兴自己能够做这些事！——这所有的一切，您知道，都是波莉安娜小姐的功劳啊。因为，正是波莉安娜小姐告诉妈妈要开心，不管怎样，她还有手和手臂。这才让妈妈琢磨为什么自己不能用手还有手臂做点什么呢。然后她就开始干活啦——开始编织，您知道。您现在可想象不到她屋子里变成什么样啦。到处都有红色、蓝色还有黄色的毛线，窗户上挂着波莉安娜小姐送给她的七彩棱镜——啊，走进去感觉好多了。以前我总是害怕走进她的房间，又黑又阴郁，妈妈也非常——非常不开心，您知道的。

“所以我们想请您转告波莉安娜小姐——正因为她，我们才知道了这个游戏。请一定告诉她，我们是多么高兴能够认识她。我们觉得，也许她知道了这点，也会因为认识了我们而感到有那么一点点高兴的。就——就这些。”米莉叹了口气，慌忙站了起来。“您会告诉她的吧？”

“噢，当然。”波莉小姐低声说，心里嘀咕着这一大堆令人印象深刻的话她能记住多少。

约翰·彭德尔顿和米莉·斯诺只是众多来访者中第一批到来的。要捎给波莉安娜的话则一直都有——这些话从某种程度上来讲真是奇怪极了，弄得波莉小姐越来越搞不明白了。

一天，身材娇小的孀妇本顿夫人来了。波莉小姐很了解她，虽然她们之间从来没有互相拜访过。她从她的名声上得知她是镇子上最伤心的女人——总是穿着一袭黑衣。然而，今天，本顿夫人却在脖子上打了一个淡蓝色的蝴蝶结，眼睛里含着泪水。她提到了自己对这场事故的悲伤和恐惧，还怯生生地询问是否可以见一见波莉安娜。

波莉小姐摇了摇头。

“很抱歉，她现在不见任何人。也许——过一阵子再说吧。”

本顿夫人擦了擦眼泪，站起来，转身要离去，但快走到大厅门口时，她又急急忙忙地折了回来。

“哈灵顿小姐，也许，您可以帮我给她——捎个信。”她结结巴巴地问道。

“当然，本顿夫人。我很乐意帮忙。”

小个子女人踌躇了一下，然后开口说道：

“请您告诉她，我——我已经戴上，这个了。”她摸了摸脖子上的蝴蝶结。看到波莉小姐脸上惊讶的表情，她补充道：“好长时间以来，这个小女孩一直劝我穿上——一些带颜色的衣服。我想，她应该——很高兴知道我开始穿了。她说弗雷迪看到我穿这些会很高兴的。您知道，弗雷迪现在是我的一切。其他人都已经——”本顿夫人摇了摇头，转身离去，“如果您告诉波莉安娜的话——她会明白的。”门在她身后关上了。

就在同一天晚些时候，又来了另外一个孀妇——至少，她穿的是孀妇的衣服。波莉小姐并不认识她，心里还奇怪波莉安娜是怎么认识她的。这位女士自报了家门，说她是“塔贝尔夫人”。

“您肯定不认识我，”她一见到波莉小姐就说，“但是您的小外甥女波莉安娜认识我。我整个夏天都在旅店里待着，每天我都得走很长的路来保持健康。正是在散步的时候，我遇到了您的外甥女——真是个可爱的小女孩啊！我希望能让您知道她对我来说意味着什么。我刚来这儿的时候，心情非常沮丧。她灿烂的笑脸和欢呼雀跃的样子让我想起了——想起了很多年前失去的小女儿。听说了这场事故以后，我非常震惊。后来又听说这个可怜的孩子再也没法走路了，还为再也高兴不起来而感到难过——可怜的孩子啊！——于是我就来看看你们了。”

“你真是好心。”波莉小姐低声说。

“您才是好心，”女士回应道，“我——我想请您给她捎句话，可以吗？”

“当然。”

“请您告诉她，塔贝尔夫人现在已经开心了。是的，我知道这听上去有些奇怪，您可能无法明白。但是——如果您不介意的话——我就不做过多的解释了。”女士的嘴角露出悲伤，眼睛里的笑意也消失了，“您的外甥女会明白我的话的。我觉得我必须得告诉——她。非常感谢您，请您原谅我的不请自来。”说罢，她便离开了。

波莉小姐算是彻底糊涂了，赶紧上楼来到波莉安娜的房间。

“波莉安娜，你认识一个叫塔贝尔的夫人吗？”

“噢，是的。我喜欢塔贝尔夫人。她生病了，非常悲伤。她住在旅店里，每天要走很多路，我们一起散步。我是说——以前一起散步。”波莉安娜的声音断了，两颗硕大的泪珠从脸颊上滚落。

波莉小姐赶紧清了清嗓子。

“呃，她刚才过来了，亲爱的。她给你留了一个口信——但是她并没有告诉我什么意思。她让我告诉你，说塔贝尔夫人现在开心了。”

波莉安娜轻轻拍了拍手。

“她这么说的——真的吗？噢，我太高兴了！”

“但是，波莉安娜，这到底是什么意思呢？”

“啊，这是那个游戏，还有——”波莉安娜突然停住，手指放到了嘴唇上。

“什么游戏？”

“没——没什么，波莉姨妈。就是——如果我不解释另外一件——另外一件我不能说的事的话，我就解释不清楚这个游戏。”

波莉小姐刚想要继续追问她的外甥女，但小女孩脸上明显流露出的悲伤神情又让她把这些话咽了回去。

塔贝尔夫人走后没多久，最令人惊讶的事发生了。这次来拜访的是一名非常年轻的女子，脸颊涂着不自然的腮红，头发也黄得夸张。她穿着高跟鞋，戴着廉价的珠宝。她的名声在外，波莉小姐也久闻大名——却很恼火竟然在哈灵顿宅子的屋檐下见到了她。

波莉小姐走进客厅的时候，并没有伸出友好之手，反而向后退了一步。

年轻女子立刻站了起来。她的眼睛非常红，好像刚刚哭过的样子。她用有点挑衅的语气询问是否可以和波莉安娜见上一会儿。

波莉小姐拒绝了她的请求。一开始她说话的语气还是非常严厉的，但是年轻女子眼中流露出的乞求又让她礼貌地补充说，还没有人被允许去见波莉安娜呢。

年轻女子有些迟疑，但还是有点挑衅地抬了抬下巴，直言不讳地说：

“我是佩森夫人——汤姆·佩森夫人。我想您应该听说过我吧——镇子上大部分的好人都听说过我——不过也许您听到的有些事并不是那样。算了，别提它们了。我来是因为那个小女孩。我听说了那场事故，这——这让我伤心透了。上周我又听说她再也不能走路了，我——我宁愿把我这两条没用的健康的腿给她。她用这两条腿跑上一个小时做的好事，比我跑上一百年还要多。别提这些了。我发现腿并不是都长在会好好使用它们的人身上。”

说完，她清了清嗓子，但是声音还是非常沙哑。

“也许您并不清楚，但我可见过您家小女孩很多次了。我住在去往彭德尔顿山庄的路上，她以前经常打那儿经过——当然并不总是经过。她会到我家来，跟孩子们一起玩，还会跟我说说话——还有我的丈夫，如果他在家的话。她好像很喜欢来我们家，也很喜欢我们。我猜她应该是不知道，像她这样的人一般是不会来拜访我们的。也许如果大家经常来看看我们的话，哈灵顿小姐，就不会有这么多——像我们这样的人了。”她忿忿地补充道。

“但不管怎么样，她来了。她自己并没有受到伤害，但是却给我们带来了很多的好处——很多很多的好处。究竟有多少，她也不知道——也没法子知道。因为如果她知道的话，她就会知道一些其他的事——我可不想让她知道。

“但就是这样的。今年我们过得挺不容易的，很多方面都很难。我的丈夫和我都感到非常伤心和沮丧，也为此做着一些准备。我们想离婚，让孩子们——好吧，我们不知道该怎么处理孩子的问题。这时传来了事故的消息，听说波莉安娜再也没法走路了。接着，我们开始回忆过去她来我们家，坐在门阶上跟孩子们玩耍，一起笑——特别开心。她总是对一些事感到高兴。有一天，她告诉了我们原因，还跟我们讲了那个游戏，您知道的，哄着我们一起跟她玩。

“唉，现在，我们听说她对自己可怜的命运感到烦躁，再也不能玩这个游戏了——因为没有什么值得高兴的事了。这就是我今天来想要告诉她的——也许她会感到一点点高兴，因为我和丈夫决定长相厮守，我们自己也开始玩这个游戏了。我知道她会高兴的，因为她过去——有时会因为我们说的一些事而感到不愉快。我不能说自己已经非常清楚这个游戏将怎么帮助我们，但我知道它会有帮助的。不管怎么样，我们都会试一试——因为她希望我们试一试。您会告诉她的吧？”

“是的，我会告诉她的，”波莉小姐声音微弱地许诺道。突然，她心血来潮地向前踏了一步，伸出手来。“也非常感谢你的来访，佩森夫人。”她简单地回了一句。

女人刚才扬起的下巴低了下来，下巴之上的嘴唇明显地颤抖起来。佩森夫人语无伦次地喃喃着，茫然地握了一下伸出来的手，转身飞快地离去了。

波莉小姐冲到厨房找到南茜，连身后的门都没关好。

“南茜！”

波莉小姐厉声叫道。过去几天里这一连串莫名其妙，令人不安的拜访，在今天下午这段离奇的经历中达到了顶点，使得她的神经紧绷到快要崩断了。自从波莉安娜出事以来，南茜还没有听到过女主人这么严厉地讲话。

“南茜，你能告诉我好像全镇人都在不停提到的那个荒诞的‘游戏’究竟是什么吗？还有，请告诉我，我外甥女到底跟这个游戏有什么关系？为什么每一个人，从米莉·斯诺到汤姆·佩森夫人都要捎信给她，说她们都在‘玩这个游戏’呢？据我判断，镇子上得有一半的人戴上了蓝丝带，或者停止了家庭争吵，或者试着喜欢上了一些以前从不喜欢的东西。这一切都是因为波莉安娜。我也试图去问这孩子关于这个游戏的事，但是好像并没有多大进展。当然，我也不想再去打扰她——我是说现在。但是昨晚我从你们的谈话中知道，你应该也是这些玩游戏的人中的一个。现在，你能否告诉我，这个游戏到底是什么意思？”

让波莉小姐惊慌失措的是，南茜一下子哭了起来。

“这说明从去年六月开始，这个受上帝保佑的孩子一直在让整个镇子上的人高兴起来，现在他们反过来想让她变得高兴一点了。”

“因为什么而高兴？”

“就是高兴啊！这就是那个游戏。”

波莉小姐跺了跺脚。

“你这说的跟其他人也没什么不同，南茜。什么游戏？”

南茜抬了抬下巴，直接迎上女主人的目光。

“是这样儿的，小姐。这是波莉安娜小姐的爸爸教她玩的游戏。有一次，她想得到一个玩具娃娃，但是在募捐桶里只找到了一副拐杖，当然波莉安娜小姐哭了，就跟其他的小孩儿一样。那时候，她爸爸告诉她，人们不可能为所有的事儿感到高兴，但总是有一些事儿是值得高兴的。所以她应该为这样一副拐杖而感到高兴。”

“高兴——为拐杖！”波莉小姐抑制住抽泣——她想到了楼上躺在床上的那双无助的小腿。

“是的，小姐，我说的就是这个意思。波莉安娜小姐也说，这就是她的意思。她的爸爸告诉她应该感到高兴——因为她不需要它们。”

“噢——噢！”波莉小姐叫起来。

“从那之后，他们就开始玩这个游戏了——从每件事儿里都找出一些令人高兴的东西。她还说您也能做到的。而且她也不在意没有得到玩具娃娃了，因为不需要拐杖是多么令人高兴的一件事儿啊。他们把这个游戏叫作‘保持高兴’。就是这个游戏，小姐。打从那时起，她就开始玩这个游戏了。”

“但是，怎么——怎么——”波莉小姐无助地停了下来。

“小姐，要是您发现这个游戏有多管用，您一定会非常吃惊的，”南茜继续说，急切的语气像极了波莉安娜，“我来跟您讲讲她在我家为我妈妈还有其他一些人做的事儿吧。您知道，她跟我回了两次家看望他们。她在太多事情上都让我非常高兴——不管是大事儿还是小事儿。她让这些事儿变得容易多了。打个比方，自从她跟我说，我应该为名字幸好不叫‘赫夫齐芭’而高兴之后，我就不大介意我的名字叫‘南茜’了。还有就是，我一直很讨厌星期一早上，是她让我为星期一早上而感到高兴的。”

“为星期一早上——而高兴？”

南茜笑起来。

“我也知道这听上去确实有点怪里怪气的，小姐，你听我说啊。那个可爱的小羊羔发现我非常讨厌星期一早上的一些事儿。有一天她就跟我说，‘啊，不管怎么样，南茜，我觉得星期一早上比其他任何日子都值得你高兴呢，因为到下个星期一，你还有整整一周的时间呢！’所以以后每个星期一的早上，我一想到她的话，就觉得被保佑着——这真管用呢，小姐。每次我想到这句话，我都会笑起来。开怀大笑是管用的，您知道的——真管用，真的！”

“但是为什么她——她不告诉我——这个游戏呢？”波莉小姐支支吾吾地问，“为什么我一问她，她就神秘兮兮的？”

南茜犹豫了一下。

“请您原谅，小姐。您告诉过她，不让她在您面前提到——提到她的爸爸。所以她就没有跟您讲。您知道，这可是她爸爸的游戏啊。”

波莉小姐咬了咬嘴唇。

“她一开始是想告诉您来着，”南茜的声音有点发颤，“她想找些人跟她一起来玩这个游戏，您知道。这就是我会开始玩的原因，这样就有人陪她了。”

“那么——那么——其他的人呢？”波莉小姐的声音也开始发颤了。

“噢，我猜大家现在应该都知道这个游戏了吧。至少，不管我走到哪儿，都会有人谈论这个游戏。她讲给很多人听，然后这些人再讲给其他人听。有人开了头，然后大家就都开始玩了。她对每个人都笑脸相迎，十分愉快，所以——所以她也总是很高兴，人们也就不可能不知道这事儿啦。现在，她受伤了，每个人都非常难过——特别是当听到她因为自己无法再找到高兴的事儿而悲伤时。所以每天大家都到这儿来告诉她，她令他们变得有多高兴，希望这么说会管点用。您知道，她一直想让每个人都跟她一起玩这个游戏呢。”

“好吧，我知道有人也将玩这个游戏——就现在。”波莉小姐抽泣着说，随即转身离开了厨房。

在她身后，南茜惊讶地盯着她的背影。

“好吧，我现在可啥都——啥都信了，”她自言自语地嘀咕道，“您可让我信了所有不相信的事儿了，波莉小姐！”

过了一会儿，护士小姐离开了波莉安娜的房间，只留下了波莉安娜和姨妈单独在一起。

“亲爱的，今天又有一个来看你的人，”波莉小姐告诉外甥女，努力使自己的声音保持平静，“你还记得佩森夫人吗？”

“佩森夫人？噢，我当然记得啦！她就住在去彭德尔顿先生家的路上。她家有个特别漂亮的三岁小女孩，还有一个大约五岁的小男孩。她人特别好，她的先生也是——只是，他们还不知道对方有多么好而已。他们有的时候会打架——我的意思是，他们经常争吵。他们很穷。他们是这么说的。当然，他们没有募捐桶，因为他不是传教士，您知道，就像——好吧，他不是传教士。”

波莉安娜的脸颊上映上了一抹红晕，她姨妈的脸也突然红了。

“不过，虽然他们很穷，但有时候她穿的衣服还是非常漂亮的，”波莉安娜急促地继续说道，“她戴着漂亮的戒指，上面镶着钻石、红宝石还有绿松石。但是她说有个戒指她不需要了，她要把它扔掉，然后离婚。波莉姨妈，什么叫离婚？我猜这可不是什么好事，因为她说到离婚的时候看上去并不开心。她还说，如果她真离婚了，她就不再住在这儿了，所以佩森夫人要离开这儿，也许孩子们也要走。但我觉得他们应该留着这枚戒指，即便他们有了很多其他的戒指。您觉得呢？波莉姨妈，什么是离婚？”

“亲爱的，他们不会离开的，”波莉姨妈赶紧说，“他们会一起留下的。”

“噢，我太高兴了！那么我以后可以去看他们——噢，天哪！”小女孩痛苦地打断了自己的话，“波莉姨妈，我为什么总是记不住自己的腿再也不能走路了呢。我再也、再也不能站起来去看彭德尔顿先生了。”

“好了，好了，别这样，”姨妈抽泣道，“也许有一天你可以坐车去啊。但是，听着！我还没有把佩森夫人要告诉你的话说完呢。她想让我告诉你，他们——他们会在一起，并且会玩这个游戏，就像你希望他们的那样。”

波莉安娜泪湿两眼地笑了起来。

“他们是这么说的？是这么说的吗？噢，我太高兴了！”

“是的，她说她希望你能高兴。这就是她为什么要来告诉你，是想让你——高兴啊，波莉安娜。”

波莉安娜猛地抬起了头。

“啊，波莉姨妈，您——听您的口气，您是不是已经知道了——您知道这个游戏了吗，波莉姨妈？”

“是的，亲爱的。”波莉小姐使劲让自己的声音变得愉快起来，“是南茜告诉我的。我觉得这真是一个非常棒的游戏，我现在也打算开始玩了——跟你一起。”

“噢，波莉姨妈——您？我太高兴了！您知道，我一直都最想让您跟我一起玩呢。”

波莉姨妈一下子屏住了呼吸。这个时候要是想保持声音的稳定实在是太难了，但是她还是做到了。

“是的，亲爱的。还有很多其他的人也要一起玩呢。啊，波莉安娜，我觉得现在整个镇子上的人都在玩这个游戏——牧师也在玩！我还没有机会告诉你呢，今天早上，我在去村子的路上遇到了福特牧师。他让我转告你，说一旦你可以见客，他就会来告诉你，说你告诉他的八百条快乐经让他的心情一直都非常开心。所以你看，亲爱的，这都是你的功劳啊。整个镇子上的人都在玩这个游戏，大家都变得比之前更加开心了呢——这都是因为一个小女孩教给了大家一个新游戏，并教会大家如何去玩它。”

波莉安娜开心地鼓起掌来。

“噢，我太开心了，”她大叫道。突然，她的脸上焕发出明亮的惊喜。“啊，波莉姨妈，我终于有些可以感到高兴的事啦。我为我曾经有双腿而感到高兴——不然的话，我怎么能够——让整个镇子的人都高兴起来呢！”





第二十九章　透过一扇开着的窗户


日子一天天过去，短暂的冬天来了，又去了——但对于波莉安娜来说它们可算不上短暂。它们是漫长的，有时还充满悲伤。尽管这样，这些日子里，波莉安娜还是非常坚强地笑对一切。现在连波莉姨妈都在玩这个游戏了，她还能不保持对它的兴趣吗？波莉姨妈发现了许许多多高兴的事！正是她，讲述了那个故事，关于某天两个可怜的流浪儿在暴风雪中发现了一扇被风吹倒的门，便躲到了下面，心想那些连门都没有的穷人该怎么办啊！也正是波莉姨妈，将她听说的另一个故事带回了家：有个可怜的老太太嘴里只剩下两颗牙齿，但她却非常高兴，因为这两颗牙齿刚好上下能够合在一起！

现在，波莉安娜跟斯诺夫人一样，用色彩明亮的毛线编织一些漂亮的东西。那些毛线散落在洁白的床单上，让波莉安娜——就像斯诺夫人一样——是如此地为她拥有的双手和手臂而感到高兴。

波莉安娜现在可以偶尔见一见访客了。而那些她见不着的人，也总是托人传来一些令人愉快的口信。他们还总是带来一些值得思考的新东西——波莉安娜的确需要思考一些新的事物。

她见过彭德尔顿先生一次，见过吉米·比恩两次。约翰·彭德尔顿告诉她吉米现在变得越来越棒，表现非常好。吉米则告诉她，他现在有了一个多么棒多么棒的家，还有一个彭德尔顿先生这样多么好多么好的亲人。他们两个人都说，这一切多亏了波莉安娜。

“这真的比什么都让我高兴，您知道，我曾经有一双腿呢。”事后波莉安娜向姨妈倾诉道。





冬天终于过去，春天来了。焦急地关注着波莉安娜病情的人们并没有看到医生的治疗起到什么明显的效果。确实，有足够的理由相信，米德医生最坏的打算将会变成现实——波莉安娜再也不能走路了。

当然，贝尔丁斯维尔的人们一直关心着波莉安娜，而这其中有一个男人，通过各种途径获取来自病榻上的每日简讯，他气恼着、烦躁着，深感痛心疾首。然而，日子一天天地过去了，这些消息非但没有好多少，反而愈加糟糕。这个人的脸上除了焦急之外，还浮现出了一些别的东西：绝望和固执的决心。两种心情此消彼长，互不相让。最后，那种固执的决心胜出了。于是，在一个星期六的早上，约翰·彭德尔顿先生多少有些惊讶地接待了来访的托马斯·奇尔顿医生。

“彭德尔顿，”医生唐突地说，“我来找你，是因为你比镇子上任何人都要清楚我和波莉·哈灵顿小姐的关系。”

约翰·彭德尔顿意识到他的吃惊表现得太明显了——他的确知道波莉·哈灵顿和托马斯·奇尔顿之间的爱情故事，但是这事他们得有十五年或更长时间没有提起了。

“是的。”他说，尽量使自己的声音听起来既富有同情心，还不显得那么好奇。但过了一会儿，他就发现自己完全没有必要担心，因为医生太过专注于自己的想法，以至于根本没有注意到这个想法是怎么被接受的。

“彭德尔顿，我想去看看那个孩子。我想给她做个检查，我必须得去做个检查。”

“呃——你不能去吗？”

“我不能吗？！彭德尔顿，你很清楚我都已经超过十五年没有再次踏入那扇门了。你可能还不知道——但我告诉你吧——那所房子的女主人曾经跟我说过，下次她再让我进去的时候，我就可以把这邀请当成是她在请求我的原谅，当成所有的一切都将恢复如初——这就意味着，她会嫁给我。也许你认为她现在正在邀请我——但是并没有！”

“难道你不能自己去吗——即便没有收到邀请？”

医生皱了皱眉头。

“这，很难。我也是有自尊的，你知道。”

“但是如果你这么担忧——难道不能放下你那自尊，忘记你们之间的争吵——”

“忘记争吵！”医生粗鲁地打断道，“我说的不是那种自尊。要是那种自尊的话，我可以跪着爬过去——或者把头低到泥土里——如果那样能管用的话。我说的是职业的自尊。这是一例疾病，我是一个医生。我总不能闯进去，开口就道，‘来，请我吧！’我能这样吗？”

“奇尔顿，你们到底是为了什么争吵的？”彭德尔顿问道。

医生做了一个不耐烦的手势，站了起来。

“为了什么？任何恋人之间的争吵都是为了什么？在争吵结束之后都算什么？”他大声咆哮道，气冲冲地在房间里踱步，“一次愚蠢的争吵，就像在争论月亮到底有多大，或者河水到底有多深一样。也许——也许这同它所带来的这么多年的痛苦相比，根本微不足道！别再提那次争吵了！至少在我看来，我宁愿说根本没有争吵过。彭德尔顿，我必须得去看看那孩子。这是事关生死的大事。这意味着——我深信——有百分之九十的把握，波莉安娜·惠提尔能够重新站起来！”

这些话条理清晰，掷地有声，而那时说话的人正站在约翰·彭德尔顿椅子旁的窗户边。于是它们恰好径直传到了外面正跪在窗户下的小男孩的耳朵里。

吉米·比恩，星期六早上的任务是拔掉花坛里新长出的杂草，现在却竖起耳朵，眼睛瞪得大大的。

“走路！波莉安娜！”约翰·彭德尔顿说道，“你是什么意思？”

“我的意思是从我听到和了解到的情况来看——在离她的床榻一英里之外的地方——她的情况跟我大学里一个朋友刚刚治愈的案例非常相似。我的朋友多年来都在潜心做这项研究。我跟他一直保持着联系，也多多少少研究了一些。从我所听到的消息来看——但我还是想见一见波莉安娜！”

约翰·彭德尔顿从椅子上站了起来。

“你必须要去见她，老弟！你不能——我的意思说，通过沃伦医生吗？”

奇尔顿医生摇了摇头。

“这恐怕不行。尽管沃伦一直很正派，他亲口告诉我他一开始曾建议和我一起商讨，但——哈灵顿小姐果断拒绝了，后来他就没敢再提这事，即便他也十分清楚我是多么急切地想见到那孩子。再后来，他的一些病人转给了我——所以我自然也更没有空余的时间了。但是，彭德尔顿，我必须去看那个孩子！想想这对她来说意味着什么——如果我能够做到的话！”

“是的，再想想这将意味着什么吧——如果你没有做到的话！”彭德尔顿反驳道。

“但是我怎么才能去呢——没有她姨妈直接的邀请——这邀请我是等不到的！”

“得劝劝她，让她邀请你去！”

“怎么劝？”

“我也不知道啊。”

“是啊，我猜你也不知道——没有人会知道。她那么骄傲，又余气未消，怎么会来请我——如果她真叫我去的话，就得履行她多年前的诺言。但我一想到那个孩子，注定要一生不幸，一想到也许我的手里还有一线生机，只因为我所谓的自尊还有职业的操守这些没用的东西，我——”他的话没有说完，手插在口袋里面，转身又开始在房间里面气冲冲地来回踱步。

“但如果能让她明白——让她理解的话就好办了。”约翰·彭德尔顿着急地说。

“是的，那该由谁去做这个工作呢？”医生猛地转过身，问道。

“我不知道，真的不知道。”彭德尔顿痛苦地抱怨着。

窗户外面，吉米·比恩突然动了一动。到现在为止，他大气都不敢出，专注地听着每一个词语。

“噢，天哪，我知道呀！”他兴奋地低声说道，“我来办这个事吧！”他立刻站起身，蹑手蹑脚地绕过房子的角落，使出吃奶的劲向彭德尔顿山下跑去。





第三十章　吉米掌舵啦


“是吉米·比恩，他想见您，小姐。”南茜在门廊上向主人通报。

“见我？”波莉小姐非常惊讶，“你确定他想见的不是波莉安娜小姐？如果他想的话，今天可以让他进去看望她几分钟。”

“是的，小姐。我告诉他了，但是他说他想见的人是您。”

“好吧，我这就下去。”波莉小姐有点疲倦地从椅子上站了起来。

在客厅里，她见到了等待她的眼睛睁得溜圆，脸蛋红扑扑的男孩。一见到她，小男孩立即开口说道：

“小姐，我想我接下来要做和要说的事儿可能会令人不快，但我没有办法。这都是为了波莉安娜啊。为了她，我可以赤脚走热炭，或者来面对您，或者——或者做任何诸如此类的事儿，不论什么时候都行。我相信您也会这么做的，如果您知道她还有机会能够重新站起来的话。因此，我才会来告诉您，既然只不过是自尊还有——还有——一些其他的事儿阻止了波莉安娜重新站起来走路。我知道您会邀请奇尔顿医生，如果您能理解的话——”

“什——么？”波莉小姐打断了吉米的话，脸上的表情由茫然一下子变成了恼怒。

吉米绝望地叹了口气。

“啊，我并不是想让您生气。所以我一上来就先跟您提到她重新走路的事儿。我以为您会听我说完呢。”

“吉米，你到底在说什么？”

吉米又叹了口气。

“这就是我想跟您说的啊。”

“好吧，那就告诉我。但是要从头说起，要确保我能明白你说的每一件事情。不要像刚才那样，直接跳到事情的中间讲起——或者把所有的事情都混在一起说。”

吉米决然地舔了舔嘴唇。

“好的，那就从头说起。奇尔顿医生去找了彭德尔顿先生，他们在书房里谈话。您能明白吧？”

“是的，吉米。”波莉小姐的声音非常微弱。

“很好，窗户是开着的，当时我正在窗户下面给花坛除草，就听到了他们说的话。”

“噢，吉米！你在偷听？”

“不是关于我啦，我也没有偷听，”吉米有点生气地说，“能听见他们说了什么，我还挺高兴的呢。要是我告诉您的话，您也会很高兴的。啊，这可事关让波莉安娜重新——走路呢！”

“吉米，你是什么意思？”波莉小姐急切地向前探了探身子。

“啊，就是我告诉您的那样，”吉米满意地点点头，“您看，奇尔顿医生认识一位不知道是哪儿的医生，说他能治好波莉安娜。奇尔顿医生觉得他——能治好她，您知道的。但是这要等他给波莉安娜做过检查之后才能确定。所以他特别想来看看她，但是他跟彭德尔顿先生说您不让他来。”

波莉小姐的脸顿时变得通红。

“但是吉米，我——我没办法——没办法做到！就是这样，我不知道！”波莉小姐无助地将手指拧在一起。

“我知道，所以这就是我为什么来告诉您，让您知道这个事儿啊，”吉米急切地说道，“他们说是因为一些原因——我没太听明白——所以您不让奇尔顿医生来，而且您也告诉了沃伦医生。没有您的邀请，奇尔顿医生不能自行前来，就是出于一种职业的自尊，还有——还有——好吧，还有一些其他的原因。所以他们想找人过来说服您，但他们还不知道能够找谁。而我恰好正在窗户外面，我就马上对自己说，‘天哪，我可以办到啊！’然后我就来了——您听明白我说的了吗？”

“是的。但是，吉米，关于那位医生，”波莉小姐急切地恳求道，“他到底是谁？他又做过什么？他们肯定他能够让波莉安娜重新走路吗？”

“我也不清楚他是谁，他们没有说。奇尔顿医生认识他，他已经治好了一个像波莉安娜这样的病人。不管怎么说，他们好像并不担心他，而是担心您，因为您不让奇尔顿医生来看她。呃——您会让他来的，对吗？——现在您明白了吗？”

波莉小姐不停地摇头，呼吸变得有点不平稳，而且越发急促。吉米焦急地望着她，感觉她都要哭出来了。不过，波莉小姐还是止住了泪水。过了一小会儿，她断断续续地说：

“好吧——我会让——奇尔顿医生——来看她。现在跑回家吧，吉米——要快！我去跟沃伦医生说。他现在正在楼上，几分钟之前我看见他来了。”

不一会儿的工夫，在大厅里，沃伦医生惊讶地见到了激动不已、面色通红的波莉小姐。更令他惊讶的是，他听到这位女士用快喘不上来气的声音说：

“沃伦医生，你曾经请求我让奇尔顿医生过来一起为波莉安娜诊病，而——我拒绝了。后来我重新考虑了一下，现在我非常希望你邀请奇尔顿医生过来。请你马上请他过来——好吗？谢谢。”





第三十一章　新的姨夫


沃伦医生再次走进房间的时候，波莉安娜正躺在床上观察天花板上舞动的五颜六色的光点。而紧紧跟随在沃伦医生身后的是一个高高的、有着宽大肩膀的男人。

“奇尔顿医生！——噢，奇尔顿医生，见到您我太开心了！”波莉安娜叫起来。这欢快狂喜的声音，让房间里面不止一双眼睛溢出了滚烫的泪水。“但是，如果波莉姨妈不想让——”

“没关系，亲爱的，不要担心，”波莉小姐激动地快速走上前来安慰道，“我已经告诉奇尔顿医生，我——我想让他今早过来给你做个检查——跟沃伦医生一起。”

“噢，所以您就请他过来了。”波莉安娜心满意足地嘀咕道。

“是的，亲爱的，是我请他来的，这就是——”但这已经太迟了，奇尔顿医生眼睛里溢出的欢喜可不会撒谎。波莉小姐看到他的表情，脸颊顿时红了，急匆匆地转身离开了房间。

窗户另一边，沃伦医生和护士小姐正专心地讨论着什么。奇尔顿医生伸出双臂拥抱了波莉安娜。

“小姑娘，我认为你今天所做的一切也是最令人高兴的工作之一。”他充满感情的声音不停颤抖着。

黄昏时分，激动万分、跟此前完全不一样的波莉姨妈悄然来到波莉安娜的床前。护士去吃晚饭了，房间里面只剩她们俩。

“波莉安娜，亲爱的，我要告诉你——你可是我第一个要告诉的人。将来的某一天，我会让奇尔顿医生成为你的——姨夫。这都是你的功劳。噢，波莉安娜，我太——幸福了！太——高兴了！——亲爱的！”

波莉安娜想要鼓掌欢呼，但却只拍了一下便停了下来，手悬在半空中。

“波莉姨妈，波莉姨妈，他很久之前想要得到的就是您的手和心吗？是您——我知道就是您！所以，他说，我今天干了一件最令人感到高兴的工作啦！我太高兴了！啊，波莉姨妈，我不知道但我真的太高兴了，我现在都不在乎——我的腿了！”

波莉姨妈把泪水吞了回去。

“也许，有一天，亲爱的——”波莉姨妈话没说完就停了下来。虽然奇尔顿医生给了她很大的希望，但她还是不敢说出口。不过，她还是说了出来——而且肯定这话——对于波莉安娜来说，也充满了希望：

“波莉安娜，下周你将进行一次旅行。你只需要舒舒服服地躺在一张小床上，会有汽车还有火车把你接到数英里之外的一位很棒的医生那里。他有一所大房子，就是为了治疗像你这样的人建造的。这位医生是奇尔顿医生的好朋友，我们去看看他能为你做些什么。”





第三十二章　来自波莉安娜的信


亲爱的波莉姨妈还有汤姆姨夫：

噢，我可以——我可以——我可以走路啦！我今天能从床边走到窗户那儿啦！一共走了六步呢！天哪，重新站起来的感觉真棒！

所有的医生都站在我的周围，他们都在笑，站在一旁的护士们都在哭。旁边病房里的一位女士，从门缝里偷偷看我。她上周第一次走了路。还有一位，希望下个月也可以开始走路的女士，也被邀请来参加聚会。她躺在照顾我的护士的床上为我鼓掌。就连扫地的黑蒂莉也从走廊的窗户朝里看，还向我叫着：“宝贝儿，我的孩子！”因为她已经泣不成声，不知道该对我说些什么啦。

我不知道他们为什么哭，但我自己却高兴得想唱歌，想欢呼！噢——噢——噢！想想啊，我可以走路——走路——走路了！我现在一点也不介意在这儿已经待了十个月，而且我也没有错过婚礼呀。这都是因为您，波莉姨妈，千里迢迢来到我的床边结婚，这样我才能见着您啊。您总是能够想到最令人高兴的事！

他们说，用不了多久，我就可以回家了。我希望我能够一路走回家。我真的这么想的。我再也不想去哪儿都坐车了，能够走路真是太好了。哦，我真的太高兴了！为一切事情感到高兴！啊，我很高兴我暂时失去了我的双腿，不然的话，我将永远永远不知道有一双腿是多么令人高兴的事。我明天要走八步。

深爱着每一个人的

波莉安娜

Chapter I. Miss Polly


Miss Polly Harrington entered her kitchen a little hurriedly this June morning. Miss Polly did not usually make hurried movements; she specially prided herself on her repose of manner. But to-day she was hurrying—actually hurrying.

Nancy, washing dishes at the sink, looked up in surprise. Nancy had been working in Miss Polly's kitchen only two months, but already she knew that her mistress did not usually hurry.

"Nancy!"

"Yes, ma'am." Nancy answered cheerfully, but she still continued wiping the pitcher in her hand.

"Nancy,"—Miss Polly's voice was very stern now—"when I'm talking to you, I wish you to stop your work and listen to what I have to say."

Nancy flushed miserably. She set the pitcher down at once, with the cloth still about it, thereby nearly tipping it over—which did not add to her composure.

"Yes, ma'am; I will, ma'am," she stammered, righting the pitcher, and turning hastily. "I was only keepin' on with my work 'cause you specially told me this mornin' ter hurry with my dishes, ye know."

Her mistress frowned.

"That will do, Nancy. I did not ask for explanations. I asked for your attention."

"Yes, ma'am." Nancy stifled a sigh. She was wondering if ever in any way she could please this woman. Nancy had never "worked out" before; but a sick mother, suddenly widowed and left with three younger children besides Nancy herself, had forced the girl into doing something toward their support, and she had been so pleased when she found a place in the kitchen of the great house on the hill—Nancy had come from "The Corners," six miles away, and she knew Miss Polly Harrington only as the mistress of the old Harrington homestead, and one of the wealthiest residents of the town. That was two months before. She knew Miss Polly now as a stern, severe-faced woman who frowned if a knife clattered to the floor, or if a door banged—but who never thought to smile even when knives and doors were still.

"When you've finished your morning work, Nancy," Miss Polly was saying now, "you may clear the little room at the head of the stairs in the attic, and make up the cot bed. Sweep the room and clean it, of course, after you clear out the trunks and boxes."

"Yes, ma'am. And where shall I put the things, please, that I take out?"

"In the front attic." Miss Polly hesitated, then went on: "I suppose I may as well tell you now, Nancy. My niece, Miss Pollyanna Whittier, is coming to live with me. She is eleven years old, and will sleep in that room."

"A little girl—coming here, Miss Harrington? Oh, won't that be nice!" cried Nancy, thinking of the sunshine her own little sisters made in the home at "The Corners".

"Nice? Well, that isn't exactly the word I should use," rejoined Miss Polly, stiffly. "However, I intend to make the best of it, of course. I am a good woman, I hope; and I know my duty."

Nancy colored hotly.

"Of course, ma'am; it was only that I thought a little girl here might—might brighten things up for you," she faltered.

"Thank you," rejoined the lady, dryly. "I can't say, however, that I see any immediate need for that."

"But, of course, you—you'd want her, your sister's child," ventured Nancy, vaguely feeling that somehow she must prepare a welcome for this lonely little stranger.

Miss Polly lifted her chin haughtily.

"Well, really, Nancy, just because I happened to have a sister who was silly enough to marry and bring unnecessary children into a world that was already quite full enough, I can't see how I should particularly want to have the care of them myself. However, as I said before, I hope I know my duty. See that you clean the corners, Nancy," she finished sharply, as she left the room.

"Yes, ma'am," sighed Nancy, picking up the half-dried pitcher—now so cold it must be rinsed again.

In her own room, Miss Polly took out once more the letter which she had received two days before from the far-away Western town, and which had been so unpleasant a surprise to her. The letter was addressed to "Miss Polly Harrington, Beldingsville, Vermont"; and it read as follows:





Dear Madam,

I regret to inform you that the Rev. John Whittier died two weeks ago, leaving one child, a girl eleven years old. He left practically nothing else save a few books; for, as you doubtless know, he was the pastor of this small mission church, and had a very meagre salary.

I believe he was your deceased sister's husband, but he gave me to understand the families were not on the best of terms. He thought, however, that for your sister's sake you might wish to take the child and bring her up among her own people in the East. Hence I am writing to you.

The little girl will be all ready to start by the time you get this letter; and if you can take her, we would appreciate it very much if you would write that she might come at once, as there is a man and his wife here who are going East very soon, and they would take her with them to Boston, and put her on the Beldingsville train. Of course you would be notified what day and train to expect Pollyanna on.

Hoping to hear favorably from you soon, I remain.

Respectfully yours,

Jeremiah O. White





With a frown Miss Polly folded the letter and tucked it into its envelope. She had answered it the day before, and she had said she would take the child, of course. She hoped she knew her duty well enough for that!—disagreeable as the task would be.

As she sat now, with the letter in her hands, her thoughts went back to her sister, Jennie, who had been this child's mother, and to the time when Jennie, as a girl of twenty, had insisted upon marrying the young minister, in spite of her family's remonstrances. There had been a man of wealth who had wanted her—and the family had much preferred him to the minister; but Jennie had not. The man of wealth had more years, as well as more money, to his credit, while the minister had only a young head full of youth's ideals and enthusiasm, and a heart full of love. Jennie had preferred these—quite naturally, perhaps; so she had married the minister, and had gone south with him as a home missionary's wife.

The break had come then. Miss Polly remembered it well, though she had been but a girl of fifteen, the youngest, at the time. The family had had little more to do with the missionary's wife. To be sure, Jennie herself had written, for a time, and had named her last baby "Pollyanna" for her two sisters, Polly and Anna—the other babies had all died. This had been the last time that Jennie had written; and in a few years there had come the news of her death, told in a short, but heart-broken little note from the minister himself, dated at a little town in the West.

Meanwhile, time had not stood still for the occupants of the great house on the hill. Miss Polly, looking out at the far-reaching valley below, thought of the changes those twenty-five years had brought to her.

She was forty now, and quite alone in the world. Father, mother, sisters—all were dead. For years, now, she had been sole mistress of the house and of the thousands left her by her father. There were people who had openly pitied her lonely life, and who had urged her to have some friend or companion to live with her; but she had not welcomed either their sympathy or their advice. She was not lonely, she said. She liked being by herself. She preferred quiet. But now...

Miss Polly rose with frowning face and closely-shut lips. She was glad, of course, that she was a good woman, and that she not only knew her duty, but had sufficient strength of character to perform it. But—Pollyanna!—what a ridiculous name!





Chapter II. Old Tom and Nancy


In the little attic room Nancy swept and scrubbed vigorously, paying particular attention to the corners. There were times, indeed, when the vigor she put into her work was more of a relief to her feelings than it was an ardor to efface dirt—Nancy, in spite of her frightened submission to her mistress, was no saint.

"I—just—wish—I could—dig—out—the corners—of—her—soul!" she muttered jerkily, punctuating her words with murderous jabs of her pointed cleaning-stick. "There's plenty of 'em needs cleanin'all right, all right! The idea of stickin' that blessed child 'way off up here in this hot little room—with no fire in the winter, too; and all this big house ter pick and choose from! Unnecessary children, indeed!Humph!" snapped Nancy, wringing her rag so hard her fingers ached from the strain; "I guess it ain't children what is most unnecessary just now, just now!"

For some time she worked in silence; then, her task finished, she looked about the bare little room in plain disgust.

"Well, it's done—my part, anyhow," she sighed. "There ain't no dirt here—and there's mighty little else. Poor little soul!—a pretty place this is ter put a homesick, lonesome child into!" she finished, going out and closing the door with a bang, "Oh!" she ejaculated, biting her lip.Then, doggedly: "Well, I don't care. I hope she did hear the bang,—I do, I do!"

In the garden that afternoon Nancy found a few minutes in which to interview Old Tom, who had pulled the weeds and shovelled the paths about the place for uncounted years.

"Mr. Tom," began Nancy, throwing a quick glance over her shoulder to make sure she was unobserved; "did you know a little girl was comin' here ter live with Miss Polly?"

"A—what?" demanded the old man, straightening his bent back with difficulty.

"A little girl—to live with Miss Polly."

"Go on with yer jokin'," scoffed unbelieving Tom. "Why don't ye tell me the sun is a-goin' ter set in the east ter-morrer?"

"But it's true. She told me so herself," maintained Nancy. "It's her niece, and she's eleven years old."

The man's jaw fell.

"Sho!—I wonder, now," he muttered; then a tender light came into his faded eyes. "It ain't—but it must be—Miss Jennie's little gal!There wasn't none of the rest of 'em married. Why, Nancy, it must be Miss Jennie's little gal. Glory be ter praise! ter think of my old eyes a-seein' this!"

"Who was Miss Jennie?"

"She was an angel straight out of Heaven," breathed the man, fervently; "but the old master and missus knew her as their oldest daughter. She was twenty when she married and went away from here long years ago. Her babies all died, I heard, except the last one and that must be the one what's a-comin'."

"She's eleven years old."

"Yes, she might be," nodded the old man.

"And she's goin' ter sleep in the attic—more shame ter her!" scolded Nancy, with another glance over her shoulder toward the house behind her.

Old Tom frowned. The next moment a curious smile curved his lips.

"I'm a-wonderin' what Miss Polly will do with a child in the house," he said.

"Humph! Well, I'm a-wonderin' what a child will do with Miss Polly in the house!" snapped Nancy.

The old man laughed.

"I'm afraid you ain't fond of Miss Polly," he grinned.

"As if ever anybody could be fond of her!" scorned Nancy.

Old Tom smiled oddly. He stooped and began to work again.

"I guess maybe you didn't know about Miss Polly's love affair," he said slowly.

"Love affair—her! No!—and I guess nobody else didn't, neither."

"Oh, yes they did," nodded the old man. "And the feller's livin' ter-day—right in this town, too."

"Who is he?"

"I ain't a-tellin' that. It ain't fit that I should." The old man drew himself erect. In his dim blue eyes, as he faced the house, there was the loyal servant's honest pride in the family he has served and loved for long years.

"But it don't seem possible—her and a lover," still maintained Nancy.

Old Tom shook his head.

"You didn't know Miss Polly as I did," he argued. " She used ter be real handsome—and she would be now, if she'd let herself be."

"Handsome! Miss Polly!"

"Yes. If she'd just let that tight hair of hern all out loose and careless-like, as it used ter be, and wear the sort of bunnits with posies in 'em, and the kind o' dresses all lace and white things—you'd see she'd be handsome! Miss Polly ain't old, Nancy."

"Ain't she, though? Well, then she's got an awfully good imitation of it—she has, she has!" sniffed Nancy.

"Yes, I know. It begun then—at the time of the trouble with her lover," nodded Old Tom, "and it seems as if she'd been feedin' on wormwood an' thistles ever since—she's that bitter an' prickly ter deal with."

"I should say she was," declared Nancy, indignantly. "There's no pleasin' her, nohow, no matter how you try! I wouldn't stay if 'twa'n't for the wages and the folks at home what's needin' 'em. But some day—some day I shall jest b'ile over; and when I do, of course it'll be good-by Nancy for me. It will, it will."

Old Tom shook his head.

"I know. I've felt it. It's nart'ral—but 'tain't best, child; 'tain't best. Take my word for it, 'tain't best." And again he bent his old head to the work before him.

"Nancy!" called a sharp voice.

"Y-yes, ma'am," stammered Nancy; and hurried towards the house.





Chapter III. The Coming of Pollyanna


In due time came the telegram announcing that Pollyanna would arrive in Beldingsville the next day, the 28th of June, at four o'clock.Miss Polly read the telegram, frowned, then climbed the stairs to the attic room. She still frowned as she looked about her.

The room contained a small bed, neatly made, two straight-backed chairs, a washstand, a bureau—without any mirror—and a small table.There were no drapery curtains at the dormer windows, no pictures on the wall. All day the sun had been pouring down upon the roof, and the little room was like an oven for heat. As there were no screens, the windows had not been raised. A big fly was buzzing angrily at one of them now, up and down, up and down, trying to get out.

Miss Polly killed the fly, swept it through the window (raising the sash an inch for the purpose), straightened a chair, frowned again, and left the room.

"Nancy," she said a few minutes later, at the kitchen door, "I found a fly up-stairs in Miss Pollyanna's room. The window must have been raised at some time. I have ordered screens, but until they come I shall expect you to see that the windows remain closed. My niece will arrive to-morrow at four o'clock. I desire you to meet her at the station.Timothy will take the open buggy and drive you over. The telegram says 'light hair, red-checked gingham dress, and straw hat.' That is all I know, but I think it is sufficient for your purpose."

"Yes, ma'am; but—you—"

Miss Polly evidently read the pause aright, for she frowned and said crisply:

"No, I shall not go. It is not necessary that I should, I think. That is all." And she turned away—Miss Polly's arrangements for the comfort of her niece, Pollyanna, were complete.

In the kitchen, Nancy sent her flatiron with a vicious dig across the dish-towel she was ironing.

"'Light hair, red-checked gingham dress, and straw hat'—all she knows, indeed! Well, I'd be ashamed ter own it up, that I would, I would—and her my onliest niece what was a-comin' from 'way across the continent!"

Promptly at twenty minutes to four the next afternoon Timothy and Nancy drove off in the open buggy to meet the expected guest. Timothy was Old Tom's son. It was sometimes said in the town that if Old Tom was Miss Polly's right-hand man, Timothy was her left.

Timothy was a good-natured youth, and a good-looking one, as well. Short as had been Nancy's stay at the house, the two were already good friends. To-day, however, Nancy was too full of her mission to be her usual talkative self; and almost in silence she took the drive to the station and alighted to wait for the train.

Over and over in her mind she was saying it "light hair, red-checked dress, straw hat". Over and over again she was wondering just what sort of child this Pollyanna was, anyway.

"I hope for her sake she's quiet and sensible, and don't drop knives nor bang doors," she sighed to Timothy, who had sauntered up to her.

"Well, if she ain't, nobody knows what'll become of the rest of us," grinned Timothy. "Imagine Miss Polly and a noisy kid! Gorry!there goes the whistle now!"

"Oh, Timothy, I—I think it was mean ter send me," chattered the suddenly frightened Nancy, as she turned and hurried to a point where she could best watch the passengers alight at the little station.

It was not long before Nancy saw her—the slender little girl in the red-checked gingham with two fat braids of flaxen hair hanging down her back. Beneath the straw hat, an eager, freckled little face turned to the right and to the left, plainly searching for some one.

Nancy knew the child at once, but not for some time could she control her shaking knees sufficiently to go to her. The little girl was standing quite by herself when Nancy finally did approach her.

"Are you Miss—Pollyanna?" she faltered. The next moment she found herself half smothered in the clasp of two gingham-clad arms.

"Oh, I'm so glad, glad, glad to see you," cried an eager voice in her ear. "Of course I'm Pollyanna, and I'm so glad you came to meet me! I hoped you would."

"You—you did?" stammered Nancy, vaguely wondering how Pollyanna could possibly have known her—and wanted her. "You—you did?" she repeated, trying to straighten her hat.

"Oh, yes, and I've been wondering all the way here what you looked like," cried the little girl, dancing on her toes, and sweeping the embarrassed Nancy from head to foot, with her eyes. "And now I know, and I'm glad you look just like you do look."

Nancy was relieved just then to have Timothy come up.Pollyanna's words had been most confusing.

"This is Timothy. Maybe you have a trunk," she stammered.

"Yes, I have," nodded Pollyanna, importantly. "I've got a brand-new one. The Ladies' Aid bought it for me—and wasn't it lovely of them, when they wanted the carpet so? Of course I don't know how much red carpet a trunk could buy, but it ought to buy some, anyhow—much as half an aisle, don't you think? I've got a little thing here in my bag that Mr. Gray said was a check, and that I must give it to you before I could get my trunk. Mr. Gray is Mrs. Gray's husband. They're cousins of Deacon Carr's wife. I came East with them, and they're lovely!And—there, here 'tis," she finished, producing the check after much fumbling in the bag she carried.

Nancy drew a long breath. Instinctively she felt that someone had to draw one—after that speech. Then she stole a glance at Timothy.Timothy's eyes were studiously turned away.

The three were off at last, with Pollyanna's trunk in behind, and Pollyanna herself snugly ensconced between Nancy and Timothy.During the whole process of getting started, the little girl had kept up an uninterrupted stream of comments and questions, until the somewhat dazed Nancy found herself quite out of breath trying to keep up with her.

"There! Isn't this lovely? Is it far? I hope 'tis—I love to ride," sighed Pollyanna, as the wheels began to turn. "Of course, if 'tisn't far, I sha'n't mind, though, 'cause I'll be glad to get there all the sooner, you know. What a pretty street! I knew 'twas going to be pretty; father told me—"

She stopped with a little choking breath. Nancy, looking at her apprehensively, saw that her small chin was quivering, and that her eyes were full of tears. In a moment, however, she hurried on, with a brave lifting of her head.

"Father told me all about it. He remembered. And—and I ought to have explained before. Mrs. Gray told me to, at once—about this red gingham dress, you know, and why I'm not in black. She said you'd think 'twas queer. But there weren't any black things in the last missionary barrel, only a lady's velvet basque which Deacon Carr's wife said wasn't suitable for me at all; besides, it had white spots—worn, you know—on both elbows, and some other places. Part of the Ladies' Aid wanted to buy me a black dress and hat, but the other part thought the money ought to go towards the red carpet they're trying to get—for the church, you know. Mrs. White said maybe it was just as well, anyway, for she didn't like children in black—that is, I mean, she liked the children, of course, but not the black part."

Pollyanna paused for breath, and Nancy managed to stammer:

"Well, I'm sure it—it'll be all right."

"I'm glad you feel that way. I do, too," nodded Pollyanna, again with that choking little breath. "Of course, 'twould have been a good deal harder to be glad in black—"

"Glad!" gasped Nancy, surprised into an interruption.

"Yes—that father's gone to Heaven to be with mother and the rest of us, you know. He said I must be glad. But it's been pretty hard to—to do it, even in red gingham, because I—I wanted him, so; and I couldn't help feeling I ought to have him, specially as mother and the rest have God and all the angels, while I didn't have anybody but the Ladies' Aid.But now I'm sure it'll be easier because I've got you, Aunt Polly. I'm so glad I've got you!"

Nancy's aching sympathy for the poor little forlornness beside her turned suddenly into shocked terror.

"Oh, but—but you've made an awful mistake, d-dear," she faltered. "I'm only Nancy. I ain't your Aunt Polly, at all!"

"You—you aren't?" stammered the little girl, in plain dismay.

"No. I'm only Nancy. I never thought of your takin' me for her.We—we ain't a bit alike we ain't, we ain't!"

Timothy chuckled softly; but Nancy was too disturbed to answer the merry flash from his eyes.

"But who are you?" questioned Pollyanna. "You don't look a bit like a Ladies' Aider!"

Timothy laughed outright this time.

"I'm Nancy, the hired girl. I do all the work except the washin' an'hard ironin'. Mis' Durgin does that."

"But there is an Aunt Polly?" demanded the child, anxiously.

"You bet your life there is," cut in Timothy.

Pollyanna relaxed visibly.

"Oh, that's all right, then." There was a moment's silence, then she went on brightly: "And do you know? I'm glad, after all, that she didn't come to meet me; because now I've got her still coming, and I've got you besides."

Nancy flushed. Timothy turned to her with a quizzical smile.

"I call that a pretty slick compliment," he said. "Why don't you thank the little lady?"

"I—I was thinkin' about—Miss Polly," faltered Nancy.

Pollyanna sighed contentedly.

"I was, too. I'm so interested in her. You know she's all the aunt I've got, and I didn't know I had her for ever so long. Then father told me. He said she lived in a lovely great big house 'way on top of a hill."

"She does. You can see it now," said Nancy.

"It's that big white one with the green blinds, 'way ahead."

"Oh, how pretty!—and what a lot of trees and grass all around it!I never saw such a lot of green grass, seems so, all at once. Is my Aunt Polly rich, Nancy?"

"Yes, Miss."

"I'm so glad. It must be perfectly lovely to have lots of money. I never knew anyone that did have, only the Whites—they're some rich.They have carpets in every room and ice-cream Sundays. Does Aunt Polly have ice-cream Sundays?"

Nancy shook her head. Her lips twitched. She threw a merry look into Timothy's eyes.

"No, Miss. Your aunt don't like ice-cream, I guess; leastways I never saw it on her table."

Pollyanna's face fell.

"Oh, doesn't she? I'm so sorry! I don't see how she can help liking ice-cream. But—anyhow, I can be kinder glad about that, 'cause the ice-cream you don't eat can't make your stomach ache like Mrs. White's did—that is, I ate hers, you know, lots of it. Maybe Aunt Polly has got the carpets, though."

"Yes, she's got the carpets."

"In every room?"

"Well, in almost every room," answered Nancy, frowning suddenly at the thought of that bare little attic room where there was no carpet.

"Oh, I'm so glad," exulted Pollyanna. "I love carpets. We didn't have any, only two little rugs that came in a missionary barrel, and one of those had ink spots on it. Mrs. White had pictures, too, perfectly beautiful ones of roses and little girls kneeling and a kitty and some lambs and a lion—not together, you know—the lambs and the lion. Oh, of course the Bible says they will sometime, but they haven't yet—that is, I mean Mrs. White's haven't. Don't you just love pictures?"

"I—I don't know," answered Nancy, in a half-stifled voice.

"I do. We didn't have any pictures. They don't come in the barrels much, you know. There did two come once, though. But one was so good father sold it to get money to buy me some shoes with; and the other was so bad it fell to pieces just as soon as we hung it up. Glass—it broke, you know. And I cried. But I'm glad now we didn't have any of those nice things, 'cause I shall like Aunt Polly's all the better—not being used to 'em, you see. Just as it is when the pretty hair-ribbons come in the barrels after a lot of faded-out brown ones. My! but isn't this a perfectly beautiful house?" she broke off fervently, as they turned into the wide driveway.

It was when Timothy was unloading the trunk that Nancy found an opportunity to mutter low in his ear:

"Don't you never say nothin' ter me again about leavin', Timothy Durgin. You couldn't hire me ter leave!"

"Leave! I should say not," grinned the youth.

"You couldn't drag me away. It'll be more fun here now, with that kid 'round, than movin'-picture shows, every day!"

"Fun!—fun!" repeated Nancy, indignantly, "I guess it'll be somethin' more than fun for that blessed child—when them two tries ter live tergether; and I guess she'll be a-needin' some rock ter fly to for refuge. Well, I'm a-goin' ter be that rock, Timothy; I am, I am!" she vowed, as she turned and led Pollyanna up the broad steps.





Chapter IV. The Little Attic Room


Miss Polly Harrington did not rise to meet her niece. She looked up from her book, it is true, as Nancy and the little girl appeared in the sitting-room doorway, and she held out a hand with "duty" written large on every coldly extended finger.

"How do you do, Pollyanna? I—" She had no chance to say more.Pollyanna, had fairly flown across the room and flung herself into her aunt's scandalized, unyielding lap.

"Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, I don't know how to be glad enough that you let me come to live with you," she was sobbing. "You don't know how perfectly lovely it is to have you and Nancy and all this after you've had just the Ladies' Aid!"

"Very likely—though I've not had the pleasure of the Ladies' Aid's acquaintance," rejoined Miss Polly, stiffly, trying to unclasp the small, clinging fingers, and turning frowning eyes on Nancy in the doorway. "Nancy, that will do. You may go. Pollyanna, be good enough, please, to stand erect in a proper manner. I don't know yet what you look like."

Pollyanna drew back at once, laughing a little hysterically.

"No, I suppose you don't; but you see I'm not very much to look at, anyway, on account of the freckles. Oh, and I ought to explain about the red gingham and the black velvet basque with white spots on the elbows. I told Nancy how father said—"

"Yes; well, never mind now what your father said," interrupted Miss Polly, crisply. "You had a trunk, I presume?"

"Oh, yes, indeed, Aunt Polly. I've got a beautiful trunk that the Ladies' Aid gave me. I haven't got so very much in it—of my own, I mean. The barrels haven't had many clothes for little girls in them lately; but there were all father's books, and Mrs. White said she thought I ought to have those. You see, father—"

"Pollyanna," interrupted her aunt again, sharply, "there is one thing that might just as well be understood right away at once; and that is, I do not care to have you keep talking of your father to me."

The little girl drew in her breath tremulously.

"Why, Aunt Polly, you—you mean—" She hesitated, and her aunt filled the pause.

"We will go up-stairs to your room. Your trunk is already there, I presume. I told Timothy to take it up—if you had one. You may follow me, Pollyanna."

Without speaking, Pollyanna turned and followed her aunt from the room. Her eyes were brimming with tears, but her chin was bravely high.

"After all, I—I reckon I'm glad she doesn't want me to talk about father," Pollyanna was thinking. "It'll be easier, maybe—if I don't talk about him. Probably, anyhow, that is why she told me not to talk about him." And Pollyanna, convinced anew of her aunt's "kindness", blinked off the tears and looked eagerly about her.

She was on the stairway now. Just ahead, her aunt's black silk skirt rustled luxuriously. Behind her an open door allowed a glimpse of soft-tinted rugs and satin-covered chairs. Beneath her feet a marvellous carpet was like green moss to the tread. On every side the gilt of picture frames or the glint of sunlight through the filmy mesh of lace curtains flashed in her eyes.

"Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly," breathed the little girl, rapturously, "what a perfectly lovely, lovely house! How awfully glad you must be you're so rich!"

"Pollyanna!" ejaculated her aunt, turning sharply about as she reached the head of the stairs. "I'm surprised at you—making a speech like that to me!"

"Why, Aunt Polly, aren't you?" queried Pollyanna, in frank wonder.

"Certainly not, Pollyanna. I hope I could not so far forget myself as to be sinfully proud of any gift the Lord has seen fit to bestow upon me," declared the lady; "certainly not, of riches!"

Miss Polly turned and walked down the hall toward the attic stairway door. She was glad, now, that she had put the child in the attic room. Her idea at first had been to get her niece as far away as possible from herself, and at the same time place her where her childish heedlessness would not destroy valuable furnishings. Now—with this evident strain of vanity showing thus early—it was all the more fortunate that the room planned for her was plain and sensible, thought Miss Polly.

Eagerly Pollyanna's small feet pattered behind her aunt. Still more eagerly her big blue eyes tried to look in all directions at once, that no thing of beauty or interest in this wonderful house might be passed unseen. Most eagerly of all her mind turned to the wondrously exciting problem about to be solved: behind which of all these fascinating doors was waiting now her room—the dear, beautiful room, full of curtains, rugs, and pictures, that was to be her very own? Then, abruptly, her aunt opened a door and ascended another stairway.

There was little to be seen here. A bare wall rose on either side.At the top of the stairs, wide reaches of shadowy space led to far corners where the roof came almost down to the floor, and where were stacked innumerable trunks and boxes. It was hot and stifling, too.Unconsciously Pollyanna lifted her head higher—it seemed so hard to breathe. Then she saw that her aunt had thrown open a door at the right.

"There, Pollyanna, here is your room, and your trunk is here, I see.Have you your key?"

Pollyanna nodded dumbly. Her eyes were a little wide and frightened.

Her aunt frowned.

"When I ask a question, Pollyanna, I prefer that you should answer aloud not merely with your head."

"Yes, Aunt Polly."

"Thank you; that is better. I believe you have everything that you need here," she added, glancing at the well-filled towel rack and water pitcher. "I will send Nancy up to help you unpack. Supper is at six o'clock," she finished, as she left the room and swept down-stairs.

For a moment after she had gone Pollyanna stood quite still, looking after her. Then she turned her wide eyes to the bare wall, the bare floor, the bare windows. She turned them last to the little trunk that had stood not so long before in her own little room in the far-away Western home. The next moment she stumbled blindly toward it and fell on her knees at its side, covering her face with her hands.

Nancy found her there when she came up a few minutes later.

"There, there, you poor lamb," she crooned, dropping to the floor and drawing the little girl into her arms. "I was just a-fearin! I'd find you like this, like this."

Pollyanna shook her head.

"But I'm bad and wicked, Nancy—awful wicked," she sobbed. "I just can't make myself understand that God and the angels needed my father more than I did."

"No more they did, neither," declared Nancy, stoutly.

"Oh-h!—Nancy!" The burning horror in Pollyanna's eyes dried the tears.

Nancy gave a shamefaced smile and rubbed her own eyes vigorously.

"There, there, child, I didn't mean it, of course," she cried briskly. "Come, let's have your key and we'll get inside this trunk and take out your dresses in no time, no time."

Somewhat tearfully Pollyanna produced the key.

"There aren't very many there, anyway," she faltered.

"Then they're all the sooner unpacked," declared Nancy.

Pollyanna gave a sudden radiant smile.

"That's so! I can be glad of that, can't I?" she cried.

Nancy stared.

"Why, of—course," she answered a little uncertainly.

Nancy's capable hands made short work of unpacking the books, the patched undergarments, and the few pitifully unattractive dresses.Pollyanna, smiling bravely now, flew about, hanging the dresses in the closet, stacking the books on the table, and putting away the undergarments in the bureau drawers.

"I'm sure it—it's going to be a very nice room. Don't you think so?" she stammered, after a while.

There was no answer. Nancy was very busy, apparently, with her head in the trunk. Pollyanna, standing at the bureau, gazed a little wistfully at the bare wall above.

"And I can be glad there isn't any looking-glass here, too, 'cause where there isn't any glass I can't see my freckles."

Nancy made a sudden queer little sound with her mouth—but when Pollyanna turned, her head was in the trunk again. At one of the windows, a few minutes later, Pollyanna gave a glad cry and clapped her hands joyously.

"Oh, Nancy, I hadn't seen this before," she breathed. "Look—'way off there, with those trees and the houses and that lovely church spire, and the river shining just like silver. Why, Nancy, there doesn't anybody need any pictures with that to look at. Oh, I'm so glad now she let me have this room!"

To Pollyanna's surprise and dismay, Nancy burst into tears.Pollyanna hurriedly crossed to her side.

"Why, Nancy, Nancy—what is it?" she cried; then, fearfully: "This wasn't—your room, was it?"

"My room!" stormed Nancy, hotly, choking back the tears. "If you ain't a little angel straight from Heaven, and if some folks don't eat dirt before—Oh, land! there's her bell!" After which amazing speech, Nancy sprang to her feet, dashed out of the room, and went clattering down the stairs.

Left alone, Pollyanna went back to her "picture", as she mentally designated the beautiful view from the window. After a time she touched the sash tentatively. It seemed as if no longer could she endure the stifling heat. To her joy the sash moved under her fingers. The next moment the window was wide open, and Pollyanna was leaning far out, drinking in the fresh, sweet air.

She ran then to the other window. That, too, soon flew up under her eager hands. A big fly swept past her nose, and buzzed noisily about the room. Then another came, and another; but Pollyanna paid no heed.Pollyanna had made a wonderful discovery—against this window a huge tree flung great branches. To Pollyanna they looked like arms outstretched, inviting her. Suddenly she laughed aloud.

"I believe I can do it," she chuckled. The next moment she had climbed nimbly to the window ledge. From there it was an easy matter to step to the nearest tree-branch. Then, clinging like a monkey, she swung herself from limb to limb until the lowest branch was reached.The drop to the ground was—even for Pollyanna, who was used to climbing trees—a little fearsome. She took it, however, with bated breath, swinging from her strong little arms, and landing on all fours in the soft grass. Then she picked herself up and looked eagerly about her.

She was at the back of the house. Before her lay a garden in which a bent old man was working. Beyond the garden a little path through an open field led up a steep hill, at the top of which a lone pine tree stood on guard beside the huge rock. To Pollyanna, at the moment, there seemed to be just one place in the world worth being in—the top of that big rock.

With a run and a skilful turn, Pollyanna skipped by the bent old man, threaded her way between the orderly rows of green growing things, and—a little out of breath—reached the path that ran through the open field. Then, determinedly, she began to climb. Already, however, she was thinking what a long, long way off that rock must be, when back at the window it had looked so near!





Fifteen minutes later the great clock in the hallway of the Harrington homestead struck six. At precisely the last stroke Nancy sounded the bell for supper.

One, two, three minutes passed. Miss Polly frowned and tapped the floor with her slipper. A little jerkily she rose to her feet, went into the hall, and looked up-stairs, plainly impatient. For a minute she listened intently; then she turned and swept into the dining room.

"Nancy," she said with decision, as soon as the little serving-maid appeared; "my niece is late. No, you need not call her," she added severely, as Nancy made a move toward the hall door. "I told her what time supper was, and now she will have to suffer the consequences.She may as well begin at once to learn to be punctual. When she comes down she may have bread and milk in the kitchen."

"Yes, ma'am." It was well, perhaps, that Miss Polly did not happen to be looking at Nancy's face just then.

At the earliest possible moment after supper, Nancy crept up the back stairs and thence to the attic room.

"Bread and milk, indeed!—and when the poor lamb hain't only just cried herself to sleep," she was muttering fiercely, as she softly pushed open the door. The next moment she gave a frightened cry. "Where are you? Where've you gone? Where have you gone?" she panted, looking in the closet, under the bed, and even in the trunk and down the water pitcher. Then she flew down-stairs and out to Old Tom in the garden.

"Mr. Tom, Mr. Tom, that blessed child's gone," she wailed. "She's vanished right up into Heaven where she come from, poor lamb—and me told ter give her bread and milk in the kitchen—her what's eatin'angel food this minute, I'll warrant, I'll warrant!"

The old man straightened up.

"Gone? Heaven?" he repeated stupidly, unconsciously sweeping the brilliant sunset sky with his gaze. He stopped, stared a moment intently, then turned with a slow grin. "Well, Nancy, it do look like as if she'd tried ter get as nigh Heaven as she could, and that's a fact," he agreed, pointing with a crooked finger to where, sharply outlined against the reddening sky, a slender, wind-blown figure was poised on top of a huge rock.

"Well, she ain't goin' ter Heaven that way ter-night—not if I has my say," declared Nancy, doggedly. "If the mistress asks, tell her I ain't furgettin' the dishes, but I gone on a stroll," she flung back over her shoulder, as she sped toward the path that led through the open field.





Chapter V. The Game


"For the land's sake, Miss Pollyanna, what a scare you did give me," panted Nancy, hurrying up to the big rock, down which Pollyanna had just regretfully slid.

"Scare? Oh, I'm so sorry; but you mustn't, really, ever get scared about me, Nancy. Father and the Ladies' Aid used to do it, too, till they found I always came back all right."

"But I didn't even know you'd went," cried Nancy, tucking the little girl's hand under her arm and hurrying her down the hill." I didn't see you go, and nobody didn't. I guess you flew right up through the roof; I do, I do."

Pollyanna skipped gleefully.

"I did, 'most—only I flew down instead of up. I came down the tree."

Nancy stopped short.

"You did—what?"

"Came down the tree, outside my window."

"My stars and stockings!" gasped Nancy, hurrying on again, "I'd like ter know what yer aunt would say ter that!"

"Would you? Well, I'll tell her, then, so you can find out," promised the little girl, cheerfully.

"Mercy!" gasped Nancy. "No—no!"

"Why, you don't mean she'd care!" cried Pollyanna, plainly disturbed.

"No—er—yes—well, never mind. I—I ain't so very particular about knowin' what she'd say, truly," stammered Nancy, determined to keep one scolding from Pollyanna, if nothing more. "But, say, we better hurry. I've got ter get them dishes done, ye know."

"I'll help," promised Pollyanna, promptly.

"Oh, Miss Pollyanna!" demurred Nancy.

For a moment there was silence. The sky was darkening fast.Pollyanna took a firmer hold of her friend's arm.

"I reckon I'm glad, after all, that you did get scared—a little, 'cause then you came after me," she shivered.

"Poor little lamb! And you must be hungry, too. I—I'm afraid you'll have ter have bread and milk in the kitchen with me. Yer aunt didn't like it—because you didn't come down ter supper, ye know."

"But I couldn't. I was up here."

"Yes; but—she didn't know that, you see!" observed Nancy, dryly, stifling a chuckle. "I'm sorry about the bread and milk; I am, I am."

"Oh, I'm not. I'm glad."

"Glad! Why?"

"Why, I like bread and milk, and I'd like to eat with you. I don't see any trouble about being glad about that."

"You don't seem ter see any trouble bein' glad about everythin'," retorted Nancy, choking a little over her remembrance of Pollyanna's brave attempts to like the bare little attic room.

Pollyanna laughed softly.

"Well, that's the game, you know, anyway."

"The—game?"

"Yes—the 'just being glad' game."

"Whatever in the world are you talkin' about?"

"Why, it's a game. Father told it to me, and it's lovely," rejoined Pollyanna. "We've played it always, ever since I was a little, little girl. I told the Ladies' Aid, and they played it—some of them."

"What is it? I ain't much on games, though."

Pollyanna laughed again, but she sighed, too; and in the gathering twilight her face looked thin and wistful.

"Why, we began it on some crutches that came in a missionary barrel."

"Crutches!"

"Yes. You see I'd wanted a doll, and father had written them so; but when the barrel came the lady wrote that there hadn't any dolls come in, but the little crutches had. So she sent 'em along as they might come in handy for some child, sometime. And that's when we began it."

"Well, I must say I can't see any game about that, about that," declared Nancy, almost irritably.

"Oh, yes, the game was to just find something about everything to be glad about—no matter what 'twas," rejoined Pollyanna, earnestly. "And we began right then—on the crutches."

"Well, goodness me! I can't see anythin' ter be glad about—gettin'a pair of crutches when you wanted a doll!"

Pollyanna clapped her hands.

"There is—there is," she crowed. "But I couldn't see it, either, Nancy, at first," she added, with quick honesty. "Father had to tell it to me."

"Well, then, suppose you tell me," almost snapped Nancy.

"Goosey! Why, just be glad because you don't—need—'em!" exulted Pollyanna, triumphantly. "You see it's just as easy—when you know how!"

"Well, of all the queer doin's!" breathed Nancy, regarding Pollyanna with almost fearful eyes.

"Oh, but it isn't queer—it's lovely," maintained Pollyanna enthusiastically. "And we've played it ever since. And the harder 'tis, the more fun 'tis to get 'em out; only—only sometimes it's almost too hard—like when your father goes to Heaven, and there isn't anybody but a Ladies' Aid left."

"Yes, or when you're put in a snippy little room 'way at the top of the house with nothin' in it," growled Nancy.

Pollyanna sighed.

"That was a hard one, at first," she admitted, "specially when I was so kind of lonesome. I just didn't feel like playing the game, anyway, and I had been wanting pretty things, so! Then I happened to think how I hated to see my freckles in the looking-glass, and I saw that lovely picture out the window, too; so then I knew I'd found the things to be glad about. You see, when you're hunting for the glad things, you sort of forget the other kind—like the doll you wanted, you know."

"Humph!" choked Nancy, trying to swallow the lump in her throat.

"Most generally it doesn't take so long," sighed Pollyanna; "and lots of times now I just think of them without thinking, you know. I've got so used to playing it. It's a lovely game. F-father and I used to like it so much," she faltered. "I suppose, though, it—it'll be a little harder now, as long as I haven't anybody to play it with. Maybe Aunt Polly will play it, though," she added, as an after-thought.

"My stars and stockings!—her!" breathed Nancy, behind her teeth. Then, aloud, she said doggedly: "See here, Miss Pollyanna, I ain't sayin' that I'll play it very well, and I ain't sayin' that I know how, anyway; but I'll play it with ye, after a fashion—I just will, I will!"

"Oh, Nancy!" exulted Pollyanna, giving her a rapturous hug. "That'll be splendid! Won't we have fun?"

"Er—maybe," conceded Nancy, in open doubt. "But you mustn't count too much on me, ye know. I never was no case fur games, but I'm a-goin' ter make a most awful old try on this one. You're goin' ter have someone ter play it with, anyhow," she finished, as they entered the kitchen together.

Pollyanna ate her bread and milk with good appetite; then, at Nancy's suggestion, she went into the sitting room, where her aunt sat reading. Miss Polly looked up coldly.

"Have you had your supper, Pollyanna?"

"Yes, Aunt Polly."

"I'm very sorry, Pollyanna, to have been obliged so soon to send you into the kitchen to eat bread and milk."

"But I was real glad you did it, Aunt Polly. I like bread and milk, and Nancy, too. You mustn't feel bad about that one bit."

Aunt Polly sat suddenly a little more erect in her chair.

"Pollyanna, it's quite time you were in bed. You have had a hard day, and to-morrow we must plan your hours and go over your clothing to see what it is necessary to get for you. Nancy will give you a candle.Be careful how you handle it. Breakfast will be at half-past seven. See that you are down to that. Good-night."

Quite as a matter of course, Pollyanna came straight to her aunt's side and gave her an affectionate hug.

"I've had such a beautiful time, so far," she sighed happily. "I know I'm going to just love living with you but then, I knew I should before I came. Good-night," she called cheerfully, as she ran from the room.

"Well, upon my soul!" ejaculated Miss Polly, half aloud. "What a most extraordinary child!" Then she frowned. "She's 'glad' I punished her, and I 'mustn't feel bad one bit', and she's going to 'love to live'with me! Well, upon my soul!" ejaculated Miss Polly again, as she took up her book.

Fifteen minutes later, in the attic room, a lonely little girl sobbed into the tightly-clutched sheet:

"I know, father-among-the-angels, I'm not playing the game one bit now—not one bit; but I don't believe even you could find anything to be glad about sleeping all alone 'way off up here in the dark—like this. If only I was near Nancy or Aunt Polly, or even a Ladies' Aider, it would be easier!"

Down-stairs in the kitchen, Nancy, hurrying with her belated work, jabbed her dish-mop into the milk pitcher, and muttered jerkily:

"If playin' a silly-fool game—about bein' glad you've got crutches when you want dolls—is got ter be—my way—o' bein' that rock o'refuge—why, I'm a-goin' ter play it—I am, I am!"





Chapter VI. A Question of Duty


It was nearly seven o'clock when Pollyanna awoke that first day after her arrival. Her windows faced the south and the west, so she could not see the sun yet; but she could see the hazy blue of the morning sky, and she knew that the day promised to be a fair one.

The little room was cooler now, and the air blew in fresh and sweet. Outside, the birds were twittering joyously, and Pollyanna flew to the window to talk to them. She saw then that down in the garden her aunt was already out among the rosebushes. With rapid fingers, therefore, she made herself ready to join her.

Down the attic stairs sped Pollyanna, leaving both doors wide open. Through the hall, down the next flight, then bang through the front screened-door and around to the garden, she ran.

Aunt Polly, with the bent old man, was leaning over a rose-bush when Pollyanna, gurgling with delight, flung herself upon her.

"Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, I reckon I am glad this morning just to be alive!"

"Pollyanna!" remonstrated the lady, sternly, pulling herself as erect as she could with a dragging weight of ninety pounds hanging about her neck. "Is this the usual way you say good morning?"

The little girl dropped to her toes, and danced lightly up and down.

"No, only when I love folks so I just can't help it! I saw you from my window, Aunt Polly, and I got to thinking how you weren't a Ladies' Aider, and you were my really truly aunt; and you looked so good I just had to come down and hug you!"

The bent old man turned his back suddenly. Miss Polly attempted a frown—with not her usual success.

"Pollyanna, you—I Thomas, that will do for this morning. I think you understand—about those rose-bushes," she said stiffly. Then she turned and walked rapidly away.

"Do you always work in the garden, Mr.—Man?" asked Pollyanna, interestedly.

The man turned. His lips were twitching, but his eyes looked blurred as if with tears.

"Yes, Miss. I'm Old Tom, the gardener," he answered. Timidly, but as if impelled by an irresistible force, he reached out a shaking hand and let it rest for a moment on her bright hair. "You are so like your mother, little Miss! I used ter know her when she was even littler than you be.You see, I used ter work in the garden—then."

Pollyanna caught her breath audibly.

"You did? And you knew my mother, really—when she was just a little earth angel, and not a Heaven one? Oh, please tell me about her!"And down plumped Pollyanna in the middle of the dirt path by the old man's side.

A bell sounded from the house. The next moment Nancy was seen flying out the back door.

"Miss Pollyanna, that bell means breakfast—mornin's," she panted, pulling the little girl to her feet and hurrying her back to the house; "and other times it means other meals. But it always means that you're ter run like time when ye hear it, no matter where ye be. If ye don't—well, it'll take somethin' smarter'n we be ter find anythin' ter be glad about in that!" she finished, shooing Pollyanna into the house as she would shoo an unruly chicken into a coop.

Breakfast, for the first five minutes, was a silent meal; then Miss Polly, her disapproving eyes following the airy wings of two flies darting here and there over the table, said sternly:

"Nancy, where did those flies come from?"

"I don't know, ma'am. There wasn't one in the kitchen." Nancy had been too excited to notice Pollyanna's up-flung windows the afternoon before.

"I reckon maybe they're my flies, Aunt Polly," observed Pollyanna, amiably. "There were lots of them this morning having a beautiful time upstairs."

Nancy left the room precipitately, though to do so she had to carry out the hot muffins she had just brought in.

"Yours!" gasped Miss Polly. "What do you mean? Where did they come from?"

"Why, Aunt Polly, they came from out of doors of course, through the windows. I saw some of them come in."

"You saw them! You mean you raised those windows without any screens?"

"Why, yes. There weren't any screens there, Aunt Polly."

Nancy, at this moment, came in again with the muffins. Her face was grave, but very red.

"Nancy," directed her mistress sharply, "you may set the muffins down and go at once to Miss Pollyanna's room and shut the windows.Shut the doors, also. Later, when your morning work is done, go through every room with the spatter. See that you make a thorough search."

To her niece she said:

"Pollyanna, I have ordered screens for those windows. I knew, of course, that it was my duty to do that. But it seems to me that you have quite forgotten your duty."

"My—duty?" Pollyanna's eyes were wide with wonder.

"Certainly. I know it is warm, but I consider it your duty to keep your windows closed till those screens come. Flies, Pollyanna, are not only unclean and annoying, but very dangerous to health. After breakfast, I will give you a little pamphlet on this matter to read."

"To read? Oh, thank you, Aunt Polly. I love to read!"

Miss Polly drew in her breath audibly, then she shut her lips together hard. Pollyanna, seeing her stern face, frowned a little thoughtfully.

"Of course I'm sorry about the duty I forgot, Aunt Polly," she apologized timidly. "I won't raise the windows again."

Her aunt made no reply. She did not speak, indeed, until the meal was over. Then she rose, went to the bookcase in the sitting-room, took out a small paper booklet, and crossed the room to her niece's side.

"This is the article I spoke of, Pollyanna. I desire you to go to your room at once and read it. I will be up in half an hour to look over your things."

Pollyanna, her eyes on the illustration of a fly's head, many times magnified, cried joyously:

"Oh, thank you, Aunt Polly!" The next moment she skipped merrily from the room, banging the door behind her.

Miss Polly frowned, hesitated, then crossed the room majestically and opened the door; but Pollyanna was already out of sight, clattering up the attic stairs.

Half an hour later when Miss Polly, her face expressing stern duty in every line, climbed those stairs and entered Pollyanna's room, she was greeted with a burst of eager enthusiasm.

"Oh, Aunt Polly, I never saw anything so perfectly lovely and interesting in my life. I'm so glad you gave me that book to read! Why, I didn't suppose flies could carry such a lot of things on their feet,and—"

"That will do," observed Aunt Polly, with dignity. "Pollyanna, you may bring out your clothes now, and I will look them over. What are not suitable for you I shall give to the Sullivans, of course."

With visible reluctance Pollyanna laid down the pamphlet and turned toward the closet.

"I'm afraid you'll think they're worse than the Ladies' Aid did—and they said they were shameful," she sighed. "But there were mostly things for boys and older folks in the last two or three barrels; and—did you ever have a missionary barrel, Aunt Polly?"

At her aunt's look of shocked anger, Pollyanna corrected herself at once.

"Why, no, of course you didn't, Aunt Polly!" she hurried on, with a hot blush. "I forgot; rich folks never have to have them. But you see sometimes I kind of forget that you are rich—up here in this room, you know."

Miss Polly's lips parted indignantly, but no words came. Pollyanna, plainly unaware that she had said anything in the least unpleasant, was hurrying on.

"Well, as I was going to say, you can't tell a thing about missionary barrels—except that you won't find in 'em what you think you're going to—even when you think you won't. It was the barrels every time, too, that were hardest to play the game on, for father and—"

Just in time Pollyanna remembered that she was not to talk of her father to her aunt. She dived into her closet then, hurriedly, and brought out all the poor little dresses in both her arms.

"They aren't nice, at all," she choked, "and they'd been black if it hadn't been for the red carpet for the church; but they're all I've got."

With the tips of her fingers Miss Polly turned over the conglomerate garments, so obviously made for anybody but Pollyanna.Next she bestowed frowning attention on the patched undergarments in the bureau drawers.

"I've got the best ones on," confessed Pollyanna, anxiously. "The Ladies' Aid bought me one set straight through all whole. Mrs. Jones—she's the president—told 'em I should have that if they had to clatter down bare aisles themselves the rest of their days. But they won't. Mr.White doesn't like the noise. He's got nerves, his wife says; but he's got money, too, and they expect he'll give a lot toward the carpet—on account of the nerves, you know. I should think he'd be glad that if he did have the nerves he'd got money, too; shouldn't you?"

Miss Polly did not seem to hear. Her scrutiny of the undergarments finished, she turned to Pollyanna somewhat abruptly.

"You have been to school, of course, Pollyanna?"

"Oh, yes, Aunt Polly. Besides, fath—I mean, I was taught at home some, too."

Miss Polly frowned.

"Very good. In the fall you will enter school here, of course.Mr. Hall, the principal, will doubtless settle in which grade you belong. Meanwhile, I suppose I ought to hear you read aloud half an hour each day."

"I love to read; but if you don't want to hear me I'd be just glad to read to myself—truly, Aunt Polly. And I wouldn't have to half try to be glad, either, for I like best to read to myself—on account of the big words, you know."

"I don't doubt it," rejoined Miss Polly, grimly. "Have you studied music?"

"Not much. I don't like my music—I like other people's, though. I learned to play on the piano a little. Miss Gray—she plays for church—she taught me. But I'd just as soon let that go as not, Aunt Polly. I'd rather, truly."

"Very likely," observed Aunt Polly, with slightly uplifted eyebrows. "Nevertheless I think it is my duty to see that you are properly instructed in at least the rudiments of music. You sew, of course."

"Yes, ma'am." Pollyanna sighed. "The Ladies' Aid taught me that. But I had an awful time. Mrs. Jones didn't believe in holding your needle like the rest of 'em did on buttonholing, and Mrs. White thought backstitching ought to be taught you before hemming (or else the other way), and Mrs. Harriman didn't believe in putting you on patchwork ever, at all."

"Well, there will be no difficulty of that kind any longer, Pollyanna.I shall teach you sewing myself, of course. You do not know how to cook, I presume."

Pollyanna laughed suddenly.

"They were just beginning to teach me that this summer, but I hadn't got far. They were more divided up on that than they were on the sewing. They were going to begin on bread; but there wasn't two of 'em that made it alike, so after arguing it all one sewing-meeting, they decided to take turns at me one forenoon a week—in their own kitchens, you know. I'd only learned chocolate fudge and fig cake, though, when—when I had to stop." Her voice broke.

"Chocolate fudge and fig cake, indeed!" scorned Miss Polly. "I think we can remedy that very soon." She paused in thought for a minute, then went on slowly, "At nine o'clock every morning you will read aloud one half-hour to me. Before that you will use the time to put this room in order. Wednesday and Saturday forenoons, after half-past nine, you will spend with Nancy in the kitchen, learning to cook. Other mornings you will sew with me. That will leave the afternoons for your music. I shall, of course, procure a teacher at once for you," she finished decisively, as she arose from her chair.

Pollyanna cried out in dismay.

"Oh, but Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, you haven't left me any time at all just to—to live."

"To live, child! What do you mean? As if you weren't living all the time!"

"Oh, of course I'd be breathing all the time I was doing those things, Aunt Polly, but I wouldn't be living. You breathe all the time you're asleep, but you aren't living. I mean living—doing the things you want to do: playing outdoors, reading (to myself, of course), climbing hills, talking to Mr. Tom in the garden, and Nancy, and finding out all about the houses and the people and everything everywhere all through the perfectly lovely streets I came through yesterday. That's what I call living, Aunt Polly. Just breathing isn't living!"

Miss Polly lifted her head irritably.

"Pollyanna, you are the most extraordinary child! You will be allowed a proper amount of playtime, of course. But, surely, it seems to me if I am willing to do my duty in seeing that you have proper care and instruction, you ought to be willing to do yours by seeing that that care and instruction are not ungratefully wasted."

Pollyanna looked shocked.

"Oh, Aunt Polly, as if I ever could be ungrateful—to you! Why, I love you—and you aren't even a Ladies' Aider; you're an aunt!"

"Very well, then see that you don't act ungratefully," vouchsafed Miss Polly, as she turned toward the door.

She had gone halfway down the stairs when a small, unsteady voice called after her:

"Please, Aunt Polly, you didn't tell me which of my things you wanted to—to give away."

Aunt Polly emitted a tired sigh—a sigh that ascended straight to Pollyanna's ears.

"Oh, I forgot to tell you, Pollyanna. Timothy will drive us into town at half-past one this afternoon. Not one of your garments is fit for my niece to wear. Certainly I should be very far from doing my duty by you if I should let you appear out in any one of them."

Pollyanna sighed now—she believed she was going to hate that word—duty.

"Aunt Polly, please," she called wistfully, "isn't there any way you can be glad about all that—duty business?"

"What?" Miss Polly looked up in dazed surprise; then, suddenly, with very red cheeks, she turned and swept angrily down the stairs. "Don't be impertinent, Pollyanna!"

In the hot little attic room Pollyanna dropped herself on to one of the straight-backed chairs. To her, existence loomed ahead one endless round of duty.

"I don't see, really, what there was impertinent about that," she sighed. "I was only asking her if she couldn't tell me something to be glad about in all that duty business."

For several minutes Pollyanna sat in silence, her rueful eyes fixed on the forlorn heap of garments on the bed. Then, slowly, she rose and began to put away the dresses.

"There just isn't anything to be glad about, that I can see," she said aloud; "unless—it's to be glad when the duty's done!" Whereupon she laughed suddenly.





Chapter VII. Pollyanna and Punishments


At half-past one o'clock Timothy drove Miss Polly and her niece to the four or five principal dry goods stores, which were about half a mile from the homestead.

Fitting Pollyanna with a new wardrobe proved to be more or less of an exciting experience for all concerned. Miss Polly came out of it with the feeling of limp relaxation that one might have at finding oneself at last on solid earth after a perilous walk across the very thin crust of a volcano. The various clerks who had waited upon the pair came out of it with very red faces, and enough amusing stories of Pollyanna to keep their friends in gales of laughter the rest of the week. Pollyanna herself came out of it with radiant smiles and a heart content; for, as she expressed it to one of the clerks: "When you haven't had anybody but missionary barrels and Ladies' Aiders to dress you, it is perfectly lovely to just walk right in and buy clothes that are brand-new, and that don't have to be tucked up or let down because they don't fit!"

The shopping expedition consumed the entire afternoon; then came supper and a delightful talk with Old Tom in the garden, and another with Nancy on the back porch, after the dishes were done, and while Aunt Polly paid a visit to a neighbor.

Old Tom told Pollyanna wonderful things of her mother, that made her very happy indeed; and Nancy told her all about the little farm six miles away at "The Corners," where lived her own dear mother, and her equally dear brother and sisters. She promised, too, that sometime, if Miss Polly were willing, Pollyanna should be taken to see them.

"And they've got lovely names, too. You'll like their names," sighed Nancy. "They're 'Algernon,' and 'Florabelle' and 'Estelle.' I—I just hate 'Nancy'!"

"Oh, Nancy, what a dreadful thing to say! Why?"

"Because it isn't pretty like the others. You see, I was the first baby, and mother hadn't begun ter read so many stories with the pretty names in 'em, then."

"But I love 'Nancy,' just because it's you," declared Pollyanna.

"Humph! Well, I guess you could love 'Clarissa Mabelle' just as well," retorted Nancy, "and it would be a heap happier for me. I think that name's just grand!"

Pollyanna laughed.

"Well, anyhow," she chuckled, "you can be glad it isn't'Hephzibah'."

"Hephzibah!"

"Yes. Mrs. White's name is that. Her husband calls her 'Hep,' and she doesn't like it. She says when he calls out 'Hep—Hep!' she feels just as if the next minute he was going to yell 'Hurrah!' And she doesn't like to be hurrahed at."

Nancy's gloomy face relaxed into a broad smile.

"Well, if you don't beat the Dutch! Say, do you know?—I sha'n't never hear 'Nancy' now that I don't think o' that 'Hep—Hep!' and giggle. My, I guess I am glad—" She stopped short and turned amazed eyes on the little girl. "Say, Miss Pollyanna, do you mean—was you playin' that 'ere game then—about my bein' glad I wa'n't named 'Hephzibah'?"

Pollyanna frowned; then she laughed.

"Why, Nancy, that's so! I was playing the game—but that's one of the times I just did it without thinking, I reckon. You see, you do, lots of times; you get so used to it—looking for something to be glad about, you know. And most generally there is something about everything that you can be glad about, if you keep hunting long enough to find it."

"Well, m-maybe," granted Nancy, with open doubt.

At half-past eight Pollyanna went up to bed. The screens had not yet come, and the close little room was like an oven. With longing eyes Pollyanna looked at the two fast-closed windows—but she did not raise them. She undressed, folded her clothes neatly, said her prayers, blew out her candle and climbed into bed.

Just how long she lay in sleepless misery, tossing from side to side of the hot little cot, she did not know; but it seemed to her that it must have been hours before she finally slipped out of bed, felt her way across the room and opened her door.

Out in the main attic all was velvet blackness save where the moon flung a path of silver half-way across the floor from the east dormer window. With a resolute ignoring of that fearsome darkness to the right and to the left, Pollyanna drew a quick breath and pattered straight into that silvery path, and on to the window.

She had hoped, vaguely, that this window might have a screen, but it did not. Outside, however, there was a wide world of fairy-like beauty, and there was, too, she knew, fresh, sweet air that would feel so good to hot cheeks and hands!

As she stepped nearer and peered longingly out, she saw something else: she saw, only a little way below the window, the wide, flat tin roof of Miss Polly's sun-parlor built over the porte-cochere. The sight filled her with longing. If only, now, she were out there!

Fearfully she looked behind her. Back there, somewhere, were her hot little room and her still hotter bed; but between her and them lay a horrid desert of blackness across which one must feel one's way with outstretched, shrinking arms; while before her, out on the sun-parlor roof, were the moonlight and the cool, sweet night air.

If only her bed were out there! And folks did sleep out of doors.Joel Hartley at home, who was so sick with the consumption, had to sleep out of doors.

Suddenly Pollyanna remembered that she had seen near this attic window a row of long white bags hanging from nails. Nancy had said that they contained the winter clothing, put away for the summer. A little fearfully now, Pollyanna felt her way to these bags, selected a nice fat soft one (it contained Miss Polly's sealskin coat) for a bed; and a thinner one to be doubled up for a pillow, and still another (which was so thin it seemed almost empty) for a covering. Thus equipped, Pollyanna in high glee pattered to the moonlit window again, raised the sash, stuffed her burden through to the roof below, then let herself down after it, closing the window carefully behind her—Pollyanna had not forgotten those flies with the marvellous feet that carried things.

How deliciously cool it was! Pollyanna quite danced up and down with delight, drawing in long, full breaths of the refreshing air. The tin roof under her feet crackled with little resounding snaps that Pollyanna rather liked. She walked, indeed, two or three times back and forth from end to end—it gave her such a pleasant sensation of airy space after her hot little room; and the roof was so broad and flat that she had no fear of falling off. Finally, with a sigh of content, she curled herself up on the sealskin-coat mattress, arranged one bag for a pillow and the other for a covering, and settled herself to sleep.

"I'm so glad now that the screens didn't come," she murmured, blinking up at the stars; "else I couldn't have had this!"

Down-stairs in Miss Polly's room next the sun-parlor, Miss Polly herself was hurrying into dressing gown and slippers, her face white and frightened. A minute before she had been telephoning in a shaking voice to Timothy:

"Come up quick!—you and your father. Bring lanterns. Somebody is on the roof of the sun-parlor. He must have climbed up the rose-trellis or somewhere, and of course he can get right into the house through the east window in the attic. I have locked the attic door down here—but hurry, quick!"

Some time later, Pollyanna, just dropping off to sleep, was startled by a lantern flash, and a trio of amazed ejaculations. She opened her eyes to find Timothy at the top of a ladder near her, Old Tom just getting through the window, and her aunt peering out at her from behind him.

"Pollyanna, what does this mean?" cried Aunt Polly then.

Pollyanna blinked sleepy eyes and sat up.

"Why, Mr. Tom—Aunt Polly!" she stammered. "Don't look so scared! It isn't that I've got the consumption, you know, like Joel Hartley. It's only that I was so hot—in there. But I shut the window, Aunt Polly, so the flies couldn't carry those germ-things in."

Timothy disappeared suddenly down the ladder. Old Tom, with almost equal precipitation, handed his lantern to Miss Polly, and followed his son. Miss Polly bit her lip hard—until the men were gone, then she said sternly:

"Pollyanna, hand those things to me at once and come in here.Of all the extraordinary children!" she ejaculated a little later, as, with Pollyanna by her side, and the lantern in her hand, she turned back into the attic.

To Pollyanna the air was all the more stifling after that cool breath of the out of doors; but she did not complain. She only drew a long quivering sigh.

At the top of the stairs Miss Polly jerked out crisply:

"For the rest of the night, Pollyanna, you are to sleep in my bed with me. The screens will be here to-morrow, but until then I consider it my duty to keep you where I know where you are."

Pollyanna drew in her breath.

"With you?—in your bed?" she cried rapturously. "Oh, Aunt Polly,Aunt Polly, how perfectly lovely of you! And when I've so wanted to sleep with some one sometime—some one that belonged to me, you know; not a Ladies' Aider. I've had them. My! I reckon I am glad now those screens didn't come! Wouldn't you be?"

There was no reply. Miss Polly was stalking on ahead. Miss Polly, to tell the truth, was feeling curiously helpless. For the third time since Pollyanna's arrival, Miss Polly was punishing Pollyanna—and for the third time she was being confronted with the amazing fact that her punishment was being taken as a special reward of merit. No wonder Miss Polly was feeling curiously helpless.





Chapter VIII. Pollyanna Pays a Visit


It was not long before life at the Harrington homestead settled into something like order—though not exactly the order that Miss Polly had at first prescribed. Pollyanna sewed, practised, read aloud, and studied cooking in the kitchen, it is true; but she did not give to any of these things quite so much time as had first been planned. She had more time, also, to "just live", as she expressed it, for almost all of every afternoon from two until six o'clock was hers to do with as she liked—provided she did not "like" to do certain things already prohibited by Aunt Polly.

It is a question, perhaps, whether all this leisure time was given to the child as a relief to Pollyanna from work—or as a relief to Aunt Polly from Pollyanna. Certainly, as those first July days passed, Miss Polly found occasion many times to ejaculate "What an extraordinary child!" and certainly the reading and sewing lessons found her at their conclusion each day somewhat dazed and wholly exhausted.

Nancy, in the kitchen, fared better. She was not dazed nor exhausted. Wednesdays and Saturdays came to be, indeed, red-letter days to her.

There were no children in the immediate neighborhood of the Harrington homestead for Pollyanna to play with. The house itself was on the outskirts of the village, and though there were other houses not far away, they did not chance to contain any boys or girls near Pollyanna's age. This, however, did not seem to disturb Pollyanna in the least.

"Oh, no, I don't mind it at all," she explained to Nancy. "I'm happy just to walk around and see the streets and the houses and watch the people. I just love people. Don't you, Nancy?"

"Well, I can't say I do—all of 'em," retorted Nancy, tersely.

Almost every pleasant afternoon found Pollyanna begging for "an errand to run", so that she might be off for a walk in one direction or another; and it was on these walks that frequently she met the Man. To herself Pollyanna always called him "the Man", no matter if she met a dozen other men the same day.

The Man often wore a long black coat and a high silk hat—two things that the "just men" never wore. His face was clean shaven and rather pale, and his hair, showing below his hat, was somewhat gray. He walked erect, and rather rapidly, and he was always alone, which made Pollyanna vaguely sorry for him. Perhaps it was because of this that she one day spoke to him.

"How do you do, sir? Isn't this a nice day?" she called cheerily, as she approached him.

The Man threw a hurried glance about him, then stopped uncertainly.

"Did you speak—to me?" he asked in a sharp voice.

"Yes, sir," beamed Pollyanna. "I say, it's a nice day, isn't it?"

"Eh? Oh! Humph!" he grunted; and strode on again.

Pollyanna laughed. He was such a funny man, she thought.

The next day she saw him again.

"'Tisn't quite so nice as yesterday, but it's pretty nice," she called out cheerfully.

"Eh? Oh! Humph!" grunted the Man as before; and once again Pollyanna laughed happily.

When for the third time Pollyanna accosted him in much the same manner, the Man stopped abruptly.

"See here, child, who are you, and why are you speaking to me every day?"

"I'm Pollyanna Whittier, and I thought you looked lonesome. I'm so glad you stopped. Now we're introduced—only I don't know your name yet."

"Well, of all the—" The Man did not finish his sentence, but strode on faster than ever.

Pollyanna looked after him with a disappointed droop to her usually smiling lips.

"Maybe he didn't understand—but that was only half an introduction. I don't know his name, yet," she murmured, as she proceeded on her way.

Pollyanna was carrying calf's-foot jelly to Mrs. Snow to-day. Miss Polly Harrington always sent something to Mrs. Snow once a week. She said she thought that it was her duty, inasmuch as Mrs. Snow was poor, sick, and a member of her church—it was the duty of all the church members to look out for her, of course. Miss Polly did her duty by Mrs.Snow usually on Thursday afternoons—not personally, but through Nancy. To-day Pollyanna had begged the privilege, and Nancy had promptly given it to her in accordance with Miss Polly's orders.

"And it's glad that I am ter get rid of it," Nancy had declared in private afterwards to Pollyanna; "though it's a shame ter be tuckin' the job off on ter you, poor lamb, so it is, it is!"

"But I'd love to do it, Nancy."

"Well, you won't—after you've done it once," predicted Nancy, sourly.

"Why not?"

"Because nobody does. If folks wa'n't sorry for her there wouldn't a soul go near her from mornin' till night, she's that cantankerous. All is, I pity her daughter what has ter take care of her."

"But, why, Nancy?"

Nancy shrugged her shoulders.

"Well, in plain words, it's just that nothin' what ever has happened, has happened right in Mis' Snow's eyes. Even the days of the week ain't run ter her mind. If it's Monday she's bound ter say she wished 'twas Sunday; and if you take her jelly you're pretty sure ter hear she wanted chicken—but if you did bring her chicken, she'd be jest hankerin' for lamb broth!"

"Why, what a funny woman," laughed Pollyanna. "I think I shall like to go to see her. She must be so surprising and—and different. I love different folks."

"Humph! Well, Mis' Snow's 'different', all right—I hope, for the sake of the rest of us!" Nancy had finished grimly.

Pollyanna was thinking of these remarks to-day as she turned in at the gate of the shabby little cottage. Her eyes were quite sparkling, indeed, at the prospect of meeting this "different" Mrs. Snow.

A pale-faced, tired-looking young girl answered her knock at the door.

"How do you do?" began Pollyanna politely. "I'm from Miss Polly Harrington, and I'd like to see Mrs. Snow, please."

"Well, if you would, you're the first one that ever 'liked' to see her," muttered the girl under her breath; but Pollyanna did not hear this. The girl had turned and was leading the way through the hall to a door at the end of it.

In the sick-room, after the girl had ushered her in and closed the door, Pollyanna blinked a little before she could accustom her eyes to the gloom. Then she saw, dimly outlined, a woman half-sitting up in the bed across the room. Pollyanna advanced at once.

"How do you do, Mrs. Snow? Aunt Polly says she hopes you are comfortable to-day, and she's sent you some calf's-foot jelly."

"Dear me! Jelly?" murmured a fretful voice. "Of course I'm very much obliged, but I was hoping 'twould be lamb broth to-day."

Pollyanna frowned a little.

"Why, I thought it was chicken you wanted when folks brought you jelly," she said.

"What?" The sick woman turned sharply.

"Why, nothing, much," apologized Pollyanna, hurriedly; "and of course it doesn't really make any difference. It's only that Nancy said it was chicken you wanted when we brought jelly, and lamb broth when we brought chicken—but maybe 'twas the other way, and Nancy forgot."

The sick woman pulled herself up till she sat erect in the bed—a most unusual thing for her to do, though Pollyanna did not know this.

"Well, Miss Impertinence, who are you?" she demanded.

Pollyanna laughed gleefully.

"Oh, that isn't my name, Mrs. Snow—and I'm so glad 'tisn't, too!That would be worse than 'Hephzibah', wouldn't it? I'm Pollyanna Whittier, Miss Polly Harrington's niece, and I've come to live with her.That's why I'm here with the jelly this morning."

All through the first part of this sentence, the sick woman had sat interestedly erect; but at the reference to the jelly she fell back on her pillow listlessly.

"Very well; thank you. Your aunt is very kind, of course, but my appetite isn't very good this morning, and I was wanting lamb—" She stopped suddenly, then went on with an abrupt change of subject. "I never slept a wink last night—not a wink!"

"O dear, I wish I didn't," sighed Pollyanna, placing the jelly on the little stand and seating herself comfortably in the nearest chair. "You lose such a lot of time just sleeping! Don't you think so?"

"Lose time—sleeping!" exclaimed the sick woman.

"Yes, when you might be just living, you know. It seems such a pity we can't live nights, too."

Once again the woman pulled herself erect in her bed.

"Well, if you ain't the amazing young one!" she cried. "Here! do you go to that window and pull up the curtain," she directed. "I should like to know what you look like!"

Pollyanna rose to her feet, but she laughed a little ruefully.

"O dear! then you'll see my freckles, won't you?" she sighed, as she went to the window; "—and just when I was being so glad it was dark and you couldn't see 'em. There! Now you can—oh!" she broke off excitedly, as she turned back to the bed, "I'm so glad you wanted to see me, because now I can see you! They didn't tell me you were so pretty!"

"Me!—pretty!" scoffed the woman, bitterly.

"Why, yes. Didn't you know it?" cried Pollyanna.

"Well, no, I didn't," retorted Mrs. Snow, dryly. Mrs. Snow had lived forty years, and for fifteen of those years she had been too busy wishing things were different to find much time to enjoy things as they were.

"Oh, but your eyes are so big and dark, and your hair's all dark, too, and curly," cooed Pollyanna. "I love black curls. (That's one of the things I'm going to have when I get to Heaven.) And you've got two little red spots in your cheeks. Why, Mrs. Snow, you are pretty! I should think you'd know it when you looked at yourself in the glass."

"The glass!" snapped the sick woman, falling back on her pillow. "Yes, well, I hain't done much prinkin' before the mirror these days—and you wouldn't, if you was flat on your back as I am!"

"Why, no, of course not," agreed Pollyanna, sympathetically. "But wait—just let me show you," she exclaimed, skipping over to the bureau and picking up a small hand-glass.

On the way back to the bed she stopped, eyeing the sick woman with a critical gaze.

"I reckon maybe, if you don't mind, I'd like to fix your hair just a little before I let you see it," she proposed. "May I fix your hair, please?"

"Why, I—suppose so, if you want to," permitted Mrs. Snow, grudgingly, "but 'twon't stay, you know."

"Oh, thank you. I love to fix people's hair," exulted Pollyanna, carefully laying down the hand-glass and reaching for a comb. "I sha'n't do much to-day, of course—I'm in such a hurry for you to see how pretty you are; but some day I'm going to take it all down and have a perfectly lovely time with it," she cried, touching with soft fingers the waving hair above the sick woman's forehead.

For five minutes Pollyanna worked swiftly, deftly, combing a refractory curl into fluffiness, perking up a drooping ruffle at the neck, or shaking a pillow into plumpness so that the head might have a better pose. Meanwhile the sick woman, frowning prodigiously, and openly scoffing at the whole procedure, was, in spite of herself, beginning to tingle with a feeling perilously near to excitement.

"There!" panted Pollyanna, hastily plucking a pink from a vase near by and tucking it into the dark hair where it would give the best effect. "Now I reckon we're ready to be looked at!" And she held out the mirror in triumph.

"Humph!" grunted the sick woman, eyeing her reflection severely. "I like red pinks better than pink ones; but then, it'll fade, anyhow, before night, so what's the difference!"

"But I should think you'd be glad they did fade," laughed Pollyanna, "'cause then you can have the fun of getting some more. I just love your hair fluffed out like that," she finished with a satisfied gaze. "Don't you?"

"Hm-m; maybe. Still—'twon't last, with me tossing back and forth on the pillow as I do."

"Of course not—and I'm glad, too," nodded Pollyanna, cheerfully, "because then I can fix it again. Anyhow, I should think you'd be glad it's black—black shows up so much nicer on a pillow than yellow hair like mine does."

"Maybe, but I never did set much store by black hair—shows gray too soon," retorted Mrs. Snow. She spoke fretfully, but she still held the mirror before her face.

"Oh, I love black hair! I should be so glad if I only had it," sighed Pollyanna.

Mrs. Snow dropped the mirror and turned irritably.

"Well, you wouldn't!—not if you were me. You wouldn't be glad for black hair nor anything else—if you had to lie here all day as I do!"

Pollyanna bent her brows in a thoughtful frown.

"Why, 'twould be kind of hard—to do it then, wouldn't it?" she mused aloud.

"Do what?"

"Be glad about things."

"Be glad about things—when you're sick in bed all your days? Well, I should say it would," retorted Mrs. Snow. "If you don't think so, just tell me something to be glad about; that's all!"

To Mrs. Snow's unbounded amazement, Pollyanna sprang to her feet and clapped her hands.

"Oh, goody! That'll be a hard one—won't it? I've got to go, now, but I'll think and think all the way home; and maybe the next time I come I can tell it to you. Good-by. I've had a lovely time! Good-by," she called again, as she tripped through the doorway.

"Well, I never! Now, what does she mean by that?" ejaculated Mrs. Snow, staring after her visitor. By and by she turned her head and picked up the mirror, eyeing her reflection critically.

"That little thing has got a knack with hair and no mistake," she muttered under her breath. "I declare, I didn't know it could look so pretty. But then, what's the use?" she sighed, dropping the little glass into the bedclothes, and rolling her head on the pillow fretfully.

A little later, when Milly, Mrs. Snow's daughter, came in, the mirror still lay among the bedclothes—though it had been carefully hidden from sight.

"Why, Mother—the curtain is up!" cried Milly, dividing her amazed stare between the window and the pink in her mother's hair.

"Well, what if it is?" snapped the sick woman. "I needn't stay in the dark all my life, if I am sick, need I?"

"Why, n-no, of course not," rejoined Milly, in hasty conciliation, as she reached for the medicine bottle. "It's only—well, you know very well that I've tried to get you to have a lighter room for ages and you wouldn't."

There was no reply to this. Mrs. Snow was picking at the lace on her nightgown. At last she spoke fretfully.

"I should think somebody might give me a new nightdress—instead of lamb broth, for a change!"

"Why—Mother!"

No wonder Milly quite gasped aloud with bewilderment. In the drawer behind her at that moment lay two new nightdresses that Milly for months had been vainly urging her mother to wear.





Chapter IX. Which Tells of the Man


It rained the next time Pollyanna saw the Man. She greeted him, however, with a bright smile.

"It isn't so nice to-day, is it?" she called blithesomely. "I'm glad it doesn't rain always, anyhow!"

The man did not even grunt this time, nor turn his head. Pollyanna decided that of course he did not hear her. The next time, therefore (which happened to be the following day), she spoke up louder. She thought it particularly necessary to do this, anyway, for the Man was striding along, his hands behind his back, and his eyes on the ground—which seemed, to Pollyanna, preposterous in the face of the glorious sunshine and the freshly-washed morning air; Pollyanna, as a special treat, was on a morning errand to-day.

"How do you do?" she chirped. "I'm so glad it isn't yesterday, aren't you?"

The man stopped abruptly. There was an angry scowl on his face.

"See here, little girl, we might just as well settle this thing right now, once for all," he began testily. "I've got something besides the weather to think of. I don't know whether the sun shines or not." Pollyanna beamed joyously.

"No, sir; I thought you didn't. That's why I told you."

"Yes, well—Eh? What?" he broke off sharply, in sudden understanding of her words.

"I say, that's why I told you—so you would notice it, you know—that the sun shines, and all that. I knew you'd be glad it did if you only stopped to think of it—and you didn't look a bit as if you were thinking of it!"

"Well, of all the—" ejaculated the Man, with an oddly impotent gesture. He started forward again, but after the second step he turned back, still frowning.

"See here, why don't you find some one your own age to talk to?"

"I'd like to, sir, but there aren't any 'round here, Nancy says. Still, I don't mind so very much. I like old folks just as well, maybe better, sometimes—being used to the Ladies' Aid, so."

"Humph! The Ladies' Aid, indeed! Is that what you took me for?" The Man's lips were threatening to smile, but the scowl above them was still trying to hold them grimly stern.

Pollyanna laughed gleefully.

"Oh, no, sir. You don't look a mite like a Ladies' Aider—not but that you're just as good, of course—maybe better," she added in hurried politeness. "You see, I'm sure you're much nicer than you look!"

The Man made a queer noise in his throat.

"Well, of all the—" he ejaculated again, as he turned and strode on as before.

The next time Pollyanna met the Man, his eyes were gazing straight into hers, with a quizzical directness that made his face look really pleasant, Pollyanna thought.

"Good afternoon," he greeted her a little stiffly. "Perhaps I'd better say right away that I know the sun is shining to-day."

"But you don't have to tell me," nodded Pollyanna, brightly. "I knew you knew it just as soon as I saw you."

"Oh, you did, did you?"

"Yes, sir. I saw it in your eyes, you know, and in your smile."

"Humph!" grunted the Man, as he passed on.

The Man always spoke to Pollyanna after this, and frequently he spoke first, though usually he said little but "good afternoon." Even that, however, was a great surprise to Nancy, who chanced to be with Pollyanna one day when the greeting was given.

"Sakes alive, Miss Pollyanna," she gasped, "did that man speak to you?"

"Why, yes, he always does—now," smiled Pollyanna.

"'He always does'! Goodness! Do you know who—he—is?" demanded Nancy.

Pollyanna frowned and shook her head.

"I reckon he forgot to tell me one day. You see, I did my part of the introducing, but he didn't."

Nancy's eyes widened.

"But he never speaks ter anybody, child—he hain't for years, I guess, except when he just has to, for business, and all that. He's John Pendleton. He lives all by himself in the big house on Pendleton Hill.He won't even have any one 'round ter cook for him—comes down ter the hotel for his meals three times a day. I know Sally Miner, who waits on him, and she says he hardly opens his head enough ter tell what he wants ter eat. She has ter guess it more'n half the time—only it'll be somethin'cheap! She knows that without no tellin'."

Pollyanna nodded sympathetically.

"I know. You have to look for cheap things when you're poor.Father and I took meals out a lot. We had beans and fish-balls most generally. We used to say how glad we were we liked beans—that is, we said it specially when we were looking at the roast turkey place, you know, that was sixty cents. Does Mr. Pendleton like beans?"

"Like 'em! What if he does—or don't? Why, Miss Pollyanna, he ain't poor. He's got loads of money, John Pendleton has—from his father. There ain't nobody in town as rich as he is. He could eat dollar bills, if he wanted to—and not know it."

Pollyanna giggled.

"As if anybody could eat dollar bills and not know it, Nancy, when they come to try to chew 'em!"

"Ho! I mean he's rich enough ter do it," shrugged Nancy. "He ain't spendin' his money, that's all. He's a-savin' of it."

"Oh, for the heathen," surmised Pollyanna. "How perfectly splendid! That's denying yourself and taking up your cross. I know; father told me."

Nancy's lips parted abruptly, as if there were angry words all ready to come; but her eyes, resting on Pollyanna's jubilantly trustful face, saw something that prevented the words being spoken.

"Humph!" she vouchsafed. Then, showing her old-time interest, she went on: "But, say, it is queer, his speakin' to you, honestly, Miss Pollyanna. He don't speak ter no one; and he lives all alone in a great big lovely house all full of jest grand things, they say. Some says he's crazy, and some jest cross; and some says he's got a skeleton in his closet."

"Oh, Nancy!" shuddered Pollyanna. "How can he keep such a dreadful thing? I should think he'd throw it away!"

Nancy chuckled. That Pollyanna had taken the skeleton literally instead of figuratively, she knew very well; but, perversely, she refrained from correcting the mistake.

"And everybody says he's mysterious," she went on. "Some years he jest travels, week in and week out, and it's always in heathen countries—Egypt and Asia and the Desert of Sarah, you know."

"Oh, a missionary," nodded Pollyanna.

Nancy laughed oddly.

"Well, I didn't say that, Miss Pollyanna. When he comes back he writes books—queer, odd books, they say, about some gimcrack he's found in them heathen countries. But he don't never seem ter want ter spend no money here—leastways, not for jest livin'."

"Of course not—if he's saving it for the heathen," declared Pollyanna. "But he is a funny man, and he's different, too, just like Mrs. Snow, only he's a different different."

"Well, I guess he is—rather," chuckled Nancy.

"I'm gladder'n ever now, anyhow, that he speaks to me," sighed Pollyanna contentedly.





Chapter X. A Surprise for Mrs. Snow


The next time Pollyanna went to see Mrs. Snow, she found that lady, as at first, in a darkened room.

"It's the little girl from Miss Polly's, mother," announced Milly, in a tired manner; then Pollyanna found herself alone with the invalid.

"Oh, it's you, is it?" asked a fretful voice from the bed. "I remember you. anybody'd remember you, I guess, if they saw you once.I wish you had come yesterday. I wanted you yesterday."

"Did you? Well, I'm glad 'tisn't any farther away from yesterday than to-day is, then," laughed Pollyanna, advancing cheerily into the room, and setting her basket carefully down on a chair. "My! but aren't you dark here, though? I can't see you a bit," she cried, unhesitatingly crossing to the window and pulling up the shade. "I want to see if you've fixed your hair like I did—oh, you haven't! But, never mind; I'm glad you haven't, after all, 'cause maybe you'll let me do it—later. But now I want you to see what I've brought you."

The woman stirred restlessly.

"Just as if how it looks would make any difference in how it tastes," she scoffed—but she turned her eyes toward the basket. "Well, what is it?"

"Guess! What do you want?" Pollyanna had skipped back to the basket. Her face was alight. The sick woman frowned.

"Why, I don't want anything, as I know of," she sighed. "After all, they all taste alike!"

Pollyanna chuckled.

"This won't. Guess! If you did want something, what would it be?"

The woman hesitated. She did not realize it herself, but she had so long been accustomed to wanting what she did not have, that to state off-hand what she did want seemed impossible—until she knew what she had. Obviously, however, she must say something. This extraordinary child was waiting.

"Well, of course, there's lamb broth—"

"I've got it!" crowed Pollyanna.

"But that's what I didn't want," sighed the sick woman, sure now of what her stomach craved. "It was chicken I wanted."

"Oh, I've got that, too," chuckled Pollyanna.

The woman turned in amazement.

"Both of them?" she demanded.

"Yes—and calf's-foot jelly," triumphed Pollyanna. "I was just bound you should have what you wanted for once; so Nancy and I fixed it. Oh, of course, there's only a little of each—but there's some of all of 'em! I'm so glad you did want chicken," she went on contentedly, as she lifted the three little bowls from her basket. "You see, I got to thinking on the way here—what if you should say tripe, or onions, or something like that, that I didn't have! Wouldn't it have been a shame—when I'd tried so hard?" she laughed merrily.

There was no reply. The sick woman seemed to be trying—mentally to find something she had lost.

"There! I'm to leave them all," announced Pollyanna, as she arranged the three bowls in a row on the table. "Like enough it'll be lamb broth you want to-morrow. How do you do to-day?" she finished in polite inquiry.

"Very poorly, thank you," murmured Mrs. Snow, falling back into her usual listless attitude. "I lost my nap this morning. Nellie Higgins next door has begun music lessons, and her practising drives me nearly wild. She was at it all the morning—every minute! I'm sure, I don't know what I shall do!"

Polly nodded sympathetically.

"I know. It is awful! Mrs. White had it once—one of my Ladies' Aiders, you know. She had rheumatic fever, too, at the same time, so she couldn't thrash 'round. She said 'twould have been easier if she could have. Can you?"

"Can I—what?"

"Thrash 'round—move, you know, so as to change your position when the music gets too hard to stand."

Mrs. Snow stared a little.

"Why, of course I can move—anywhere—in bed," she rejoined a little irritably.

"Well, you can be glad of that, then, anyhow, can't you?" nodded Pollyanna. "Mrs. White couldn't. You can't thrash when you have rheumatic fever—though you want to something awful, Mrs. White says. She told me afterwards she reckoned she'd have gone raving crazy if it hadn't been for Mr. White's sister's ears—being deaf, so."

"Sister's—ears! What do you mean?"

Pollyanna laughed.

"Well, I reckon I didn't tell it all, and I forgot you didn't know Mrs.White. You see, Miss White was deaf—awfully deaf; and she came to visit 'em and to help take care of Mrs. White and the house. Well, they had such an awful time making her understand anything, that after that, every time the piano commenced to play across the street, Mrs. White felt so glad she could hear it, that she didn't mind so much that she did hear it, 'cause she couldn't help thinking how awful 'twould be if she was deaf and couldn't hear anything, like her husband's sister. You see, she was playing the game, too. I'd told her about it."

"The—game?"

Pollyanna clapped her hands.

"There! I 'most forgot; but I've thought it up, Mrs. Snow—what you can be glad about."

"Glad about! What do you mean?"

"Why, I told you I would. Don't you remember? You asked me to tell you something to be glad about—glad, you know, even though you did have to lie here abed all day."

"Oh!" scoffed the woman. "That? Yes, I remember that; but I didn't suppose you were in earnest any more than I was."

"Oh, yes, I was," nodded Pollyanna, triumphantly, "and I found it, too. But 'twas hard. It's all the more fun, though, always, when 'tis hard. And I will own up, honest to true, that I couldn't think of anything for a while. Then I got it."

"Did you, really? Well, what is it?" Mrs. Snow's voice was sarcastically polite.

Pollyanna drew a long breath.

"I thought—how glad you could be—that other folks weren't like you—all sick in bed like this, you know," she announced impressively.Mrs. Snow stared. Her eyes were angry.

"Well, really!" she ejaculated then, in not quite an agreeable tone of voice.

"And now I'll tell you the game," proposed Pollyanna, blithely confident. "It'll be just lovely for you to play—it'll be so hard. And there's so much more fun when it is hard! You see, it's like this." And she began to tell of the missionary barrel, the crutches, and the doll that did not come.

The story was just finished when Milly appeared at the door.

"Your aunt is wanting you, Miss Pollyanna," she said with dreary listlessness. "She telephoned down to the Harlows' across the way.She says you're to hurry—that you've got some practising to make up before dark."

Pollyanna rose reluctantly.

"All right," she sighed. "I'll hurry." Suddenly she laughed. "I suppose I ought to be glad I've got legs to hurry with, hadn't I, Mrs. Snow?"

There was no answer. Mrs. Snow's eyes were closed. But Milly, whose eyes were wide open with surprise, saw that there were tears on the wasted cheeks.

"Good-by," flung Pollyanna over her shoulder, as she reached the door. "I'm awfully sorry about the hair—I wanted to do it. But maybe I can next time!"





One by one the July days passed. To Pollyanna, they were happy days, indeed. She often told her aunt, joyously, how very happy they were. Whereupon her aunt would usually reply, wearily:

"Very well, Pollyanna. I am gratified, of course, that they are happy; but I trust that they are profitable, as well—otherwise I should have failed signally in my duty."

Generally Pollyanna would answer this with a hug and a kiss—a proceeding that was still always most disconcerting to Miss Polly; but one day she spoke. It was during the sewing hour.

"Do you mean that it wouldn't be enough then, Aunt Polly, that they should be just happy days?" she asked wistfully.

"That is what I mean, Pollyanna."

"They must be pro-fi-ta-ble as well?"

"Certainly."

"What is being pro-fi-ta-ble?"

"Why, it—it's just being profitable—having profit, something to show for it, Pollyanna. What an extraordinary child you are!"

"Then just being glad isn't pro-fi-ta-ble?" questioned Pollyanna, a little anxiously.

"Certainly not."

"O dear! Then you wouldn't like it, of course. I'm afraid, now, you won't ever play the game, Aunt Polly."

"Game? What game?"

"Why, that father—" Pollyanna clapped her hand to her lips. "N-nothing," she stammered. Miss Polly frowned.

"That will do for this morning, Pollyanna," she said tersely. And the sewing lesson was over.

It was that afternoon that Pollyanna, coming down from her attic room, met her aunt on the stairway.

"Why, Aunt Polly, how perfectly lovely!" she cried. "You were coming up to see me! Come right in. I love company," she finished, scampering up the stairs and throwing her door wide open.

Now Miss Polly had not been intending to call on her niece.She had been planning to look for a certain white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window. But to her unbounded surprise now, she found herself, not in the main attic before the cedar chest, but in Pollyanna's little room sitting in one of the straight-backed chairs—so many, many times since Pollyanna came, Miss Polly had found herself like this, doing some utterly unexpected, surprising thing, quite unlike the thing she had set out to do!

"I love company," said Pollyanna, again, flitting about as if she were dispensing the hospitality of a palace; "specially since I've had this room, all mine, you know. Oh, of course, I had a room, always, but'twas a hired room, and hired rooms aren't half as nice as owned ones, are they? And of course I do own this one, don't I?"

"Why, y-yes, Pollyanna," murmured Miss Polly, vaguely wondering why she did not get up at once and go to look for that shawl.

"And of course now I just love this room, even if it hasn't got the carpets and curtains and pictures that I'd been want—" With a painful blush Pollyanna stopped short. She was plunging into an entirely different sentence when her aunt interrupted her sharply.

"What's that, Pollyanna?"

"N-nothing, Aunt Polly, truly. I didn't mean to say it."

"Probably not," returned Miss Polly, coldly, "but you did say it, so suppose we have the rest of it."

"But it wasn't anything only that I'd been kind of planning on pretty carpets and lace curtains and things, you know. But, of course—"

"Planning on them!" interrupted Miss Polly, sharply.

Pollyanna blushed still more painfully.

"I ought not to have, of course, Aunt Polly," she apologized. "It was only because I'd always wanted them and hadn't had them, I suppose. Oh, we'd had two rugs in the barrels, but they were little, you know, and one had ink spots, and the other holes; and there never were only those two pictures; the one fath—I mean the good one we sold, and the bad one that broke. Of course if it hadn't been for all that I shouldn't have wanted them, so—pretty things, I mean; and I shouldn't have got to planning all through the hall that first day how pretty mine would be here, and—and—but, truly, Aunt Polly, it wasn't but just a minute—I mean, a few minutes—before I was being glad that the bureau didn't have a looking-glass, because it didn't show my freckles; and there couldn't be a nicer picture than the one of out my window there; and you've been so good to me, that—"

Miss Polly rose suddenly to her feet. Her face was very red.

"That will do, Pollyanna," she said stiffly.

"You have said quite enough, I'm sure." The next minute she had swept down the stairs—and not until she reached the first floor did it suddenly occur to her that she had gone up into the attic to find a white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window.

Less than twenty-four hours later, Miss Polly said to Nancy, crisply:

"Nancy, you may move Miss Pollyanna's things down-stairs this morning to the room directly beneath. I have decided to have my niece sleep there for the present."

"Yes, ma'am," said Nancy aloud.

"O glory!" said Nancy to herself.

To Pollyanna, a minute later, she cried joyously:

"And won't ye jest be listenin' ter this, Miss Pollyanna. You're ter sleep down-stairs in the room straight under this. You are—you are!"

Pollyanna actually grew white.

"You mean—why, Nancy, not really—really and truly?"

"I guess you'll think it's really and truly," prophesied Nancy, exultingly, nodding her head to Pollyanna over the armful of dresses she had taken from the closet. "I'm told ter take down yer things, and I'm goin' ter take 'em, too, 'fore she gets a chance ter change her mind."

Pollyanna did not stop to hear the end of this sentence. At the imminent risk of being dashed headlong, she was flying down-stairs, two steps at a time.

Bang went two doors and a chair before Pollyanna at last reached her goal—Aunt Polly.

"Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, did you mean it, really? Why, that room's got everything—the carpet and curtains and three pictures, besides the one outdoors, too, 'cause the windows look the same way.Oh, Aunt Polly!"

"Very well, Pollyanna. I am gratified that you like the change, of course; but if you think so much of all those things, I trust you will take proper care of them; that's all. Pollyanna, please pick up that chair; and you have banged two doors in the last half-minute." Miss Polly spoke sternly, all the more sternly because, for some inexplicable reason, she felt inclined to cry—and Miss Polly was not used to feeling inclined to cry.

Pollyanna picked up the chair.

"Yes'm; I know I banged 'em—those doors," she admitted cheerfully. "You see I'd just found out about the room, and I reckon you'd have banged doors if—" Pollyanna stopped short and eyed her aunt with new interest. "Aunt Polly, did you ever bang doors?"

"I hope—not, Pollyanna!" Miss Polly's voice was properly shocked.

"Why, Aunt Polly, what a shame!" Pollyanna's face expressed only concerned sympathy.

"A shame!" repeated Aunt Polly, too dazed to say more.

"Why, yes. You see, if you'd felt like banging doors you'd have banged 'em, of course; and if you didn't, that must have meant that you weren't ever glad over anything—or you would have banged 'em. You couldn't have helped it. And I'm so sorry you weren't ever glad over anything!"

"Pollyanna!" gasped the lady; but Pollyanna was gone, and only the distant bang of the attic-stairway door answered for her. Pollyanna had gone to help Nancy bring down "her things".

Miss Polly, in the sitting-room, felt vaguely disturbed;—but then, of course she had been glad—over some things!





Chapter XI. Introducing Jimmy


August came. August brought several surprises and some changes—none of which, however, were really a surprise to Nancy.Nancy, since Pollyanna's arrival, had come to look for surprises and changes.

First there was the kitten.

Pollyanna found the kitten mewing pitifully some distance down the road. When systematic questioning of the neighbors failed to find any one who claimed it, Pollyanna brought it home at once, as a matter of course.

"And I was glad I didn't find any one who owned it, too," she told her aunt in happy confidence, "'cause I wanted to bring it home all the time. I love kitties. I knew you'd be glad to let it live here."

Miss Polly looked at the forlorn little gray bunch of neglected misery in Pollyanna's arms, and shivered: Miss Polly did not care for cats—not even pretty, healthy, clean ones.

"Ugh! Pollyanna! What a dirty little beast! And it's sick, I'm sure, and all mangy and fleay."

"I know it, poor little thing," crooned Pollyanna, tenderly, looking into the little creature's frightened eyes. "And it's all trembly, too, it's so scared. You see it doesn't know, yet, that we're going to keep it, of course."

"No—nor anybody else," retorted Miss Polly, with meaning emphasis.

"Oh, yes, they do," nodded Pollyanna, entirely misunderstanding her aunt's words. "I told everybody we should keep it, if I didn't find where it belonged. I knew you'd be glad to have it—poor little lonesome thing!"

Miss Polly opened her lips and tried to speak; but in vain. The curious helpless feeling that had been hers so often since Pollyanna's arrival, had her now fast in its grip.

"Of course I knew," hurried on Pollyanna, gratefully, "that you wouldn't let a dear little lonesome kitty go hunting for a home when you'd just taken me in; and I said so to Mrs. Ford when she asked if you'd let me keep it. Why, I had the Ladies' Aid, you know, and kitty didn't have anybody. I knew you'd feel that way," she nodded happily, as she ran from the room.

"But, Pollyanna, Pollyanna," remonstrated Miss Polly. "I don't—" But Pollyanna was already halfway to the kitchen, calling:

"Nancy, Nancy, just see this dear little kitty that Aunt Polly is going to bring up along with me!" And Aunt Polly, in the sitting room—who abhorred cats—fell back in her chair with a gasp of dismay, powerless to remonstrate.

The next day it was a dog, even dirtier and more forlorn, perhaps, than was the kitten; and again Miss Polly, to her dumfounded amazement, found herself figuring as a kind protector and an angel of mercy—a role that Pollyanna so unhesitatingly thrust upon her as a matter of course, that the woman—who abhorred dogs even more than she did cats, if possible—found herself as before, powerless to remonstrate.

When, in less than a week, however, Pollyanna brought home a small, ragged boy, and confidently claimed the same protection for him, Miss Polly did have something to say. It happened after this wise.

On a pleasant Thursday morning Pollyanna had been taking calf's-foot jelly again to Mrs. Snow. Mrs. Snow and Pollyanna were the best of friends now. Their friendship had started from the third visit Pollyanna had made, the one after she had told Mrs. Snow of the game. Mrs. Snow herself was playing the game now, with Pollyanna. To be sure, she was not playing it very well—she had been sorry for everything for so long, that it was not easy to be glad for anything now. But under Pollyanna's cheery instructions and merry laughter at her mistakes, she was learning fast. To-day, even, to Pollyanna's huge delight, she had said that she was glad Pollyanna brought calf's-foot jelly, because that was just what she had been wanting—she did not know that Milly, at the front door, had told Pollyanna that the minister's wife had already that day sent over a great bowlful of that same kind of jelly.

Pollyanna was thinking of this now, when suddenly she saw the boy.

The boy was sitting in a disconsolate little heap by the roadside, whittling half-heartedly at a small stick.

"Hullo," smiled Pollyanna, engagingly.

The boy glanced up, but he looked away again, at once.

"Hullo yourself," he mumbled.

Pollyanna laughed.

"Now you don't look as if you'd be glad even for calf's-foot jelly," she chuckled, stopping before him.

The boy stirred restlessly, gave her a surprised look, and began to whittle again at his stick, with the dull, broken-bladed knife in his hand.

Pollyanna hesitated, then dropped herself comfortably down on the grass near him. In spite of Pollyanna's brave assertion that she was "used to Ladies' Aiders", and "didn't mind", she had sighed at times for some companion of her own age. Hence her determination to make the most of this one.

"My name's Pollyanna Whittier," she began pleasantly. "What's yours?"

Again the boy stirred restlessly. He even almost got to his feet. But he settled back.

"Jimmy Bean," he grunted with ungracious indifference.

"Good! Now we're introduced. I'm glad you did your part—some folks don't, you know. I live at Miss Polly Harrington's house. Where do you live?"

"Nowhere."

"Nowhere! Why, you can't do that—everybody lives somewhere," asserted Pollyanna.

"Well, I don't—just now. I'm huntin' up a new place."

"Oh! Where is it?"

The boy regarded her with scornful eyes.

"Silly! As if I'd be a-huntin' for it—if I knew!"

Pollyanna tossed her head a little. This was not a nice boy, and she did not like to be called "silly". Still, he was somebody besides—old folks. "Where did you live—before?" she queried.

"Well, if you ain't the beat 'em for askin' questions!" sighed the boy impatiently.

"I have to be," retorted Pollyanna calmly, "else I couldn't find out a thing about you. If you'd talk more I wouldn't talk so much."

The boy gave a short laugh. It was a sheepish laugh, and not quite a willing one; but his face looked a little pleasanter when he spoke this time.

"All right then—here goes! I'm Jimmy Bean, and I'm ten years old goin' on eleven. I come last year ter live at the Orphans' Home; but they've got so many kids there ain't much room for me, an' I wa'n't never wanted, anyhow, I don't believe. So I've quit. I'm goin' ter live somewheres else—but I hain't found the place, yet. I'd like a home—jest a common one, ye know, with a mother in it, instead of a Matron. If ye has a home, ye has folks; an' I hain't had folks since—dad died. So I'm a-huntin' now. I've tried four houses, but—they didn't want me—though I said I expected ter work, 'course. There! Is that all you want ter know?" The boy's voice had broken a little over the last two sentences.

"Why, what a shame!" sympathized Pollyanna. "And didn't there anybody want you? O dear! I know just how you feel, because after—after my father died, too, there wasn't anybody but the Ladies' Aid for me, until Aunt Polly said she'd take—" Pollyanna stopped abruptly. The dawning of a wonderful idea began to show in her face.

"Oh, I know just the place for you," she cried. "Aunt Polly'll take you—I know she will! Didn't she take me? And didn't she take Fluffy and Buffy, when they didn't have anyone to love them, or any place to go?—and they're only cats and dogs. Oh, come, I know Aunt Polly'll take you! You don't know how good and kind she is!"

Jimmy Bean's thin little face brightened.

"Honest Injun? Would she, now? I'd work, ye know, an' I'm real strong!" He bared a small, bony arm.

"Of course she would! Why, my Aunt Polly is the nicest lady in the world—now that my mama has gone to be a Heaven angel. And there's rooms—heaps of 'em," she continued, springing to her feet, and tugging at his arm. "It's an awful big house. Maybe, though," she added a little anxiously, as they hurried on, "maybe you'll have to sleep in the attic room. I did, at first. But there's screens there now, so 'twon't be so hot, and the flies can't get in, either, to bring in the germ-things on their feet. Did you know about that? It's perfectly lovely! Maybe she'll let you read the book if you're good—I mean, if you're bad. And you've got freckles, too,"—with a critical glance—"so you'll be glad there isn't any looking-glass; and the outdoor picture is nicer than any wall-one could be, so you won't mind sleeping in that room at all, I'm sure," panted Pollyanna, finding suddenly that she needed the rest of her breath for purposes other than talking.

"Gorry!" exclaimed Jimmy Bean tersely and uncomprehendingly, but admiringly. Then he added: "I shouldn't think anybody who could talk like that, runnin', would need ter ask no questions ter fill up time with!"

Pollyanna laughed.

"Well, anyhow, you can be glad of that," she retorted; "for when I'm talking, you don't have to!"

When the house was reached, Pollyanna unhesitatingly piloted her companion straight into the presence of her amazed aunt.

"Oh, Aunt Polly," she triumphed, "just look a-here! I've got something ever so much nicer, even, than Fluffy and Buffy for you to bring up. It's a real live boy. He won't mind a bit sleeping in the attic, at first, you know, and he says he'll work; but I shall need him the most of the time to play with, I reckon."

Miss Polly grew white, then very red. She did not quite understand; but she thought she understood enough.

"Pollyanna, what does this mean? Who is this dirty little boy? Where did you find him?" she demanded sharply.

The "dirty little boy" fell back a step and looked toward the door.Pollyanna laughed merrily.

"There, if I didn't forget to tell you his name! I'm as bad as the Man. And he is dirty, too, isn't he?—I mean, the boy is—just like Fluffy and Buffy were when you took them in. But I reckon he'll improve all right by washing, just as they did, and—Oh, I'most forgot again," she broke off with a laugh. "This is Jimmy Bean, Aunt Polly."

"Well, what is he doing here?"

"Why, Aunt Polly, I just told you!" Pollyanna's eyes were wide with surprise. "He's for you. I brought him home—so he could live here, you know. He wants a home and folks. I told him how good you were to me, and to Fluffy and Buffy, and that I knew you would be to him, because of course he's even nicer than cats and dogs."

Miss Polly dropped back in her chair and raised a shaking hand to her throat. The old helplessness was threatening once more to overcome her. With a visible struggle, however, Miss Polly pulled herself suddenly erect.

"That will do, Pollyanna. This is a little the most absurd thing you've done yet. As if tramp cats and mangy dogs weren't bad enough but you must needs bring home ragged little beggars from the street, who—"

There was a sudden stir from the boy. His eyes flashed and his chin came up. With two strides of his sturdy little legs he confronted Miss Polly fearlessly.

"I ain't a beggar, marm, an' I don't want nothin' o' you. I was cal'latin' ter work, of course, fur my board an' keep. I wouldn't have come ter your old house, anyhow, if this 'ere girl hadn't 'a' made me, a-tellin' me how you was so good an' kind that you'd be jest dyin' ter take me in. So, there!" And he wheeled about and stalked from the room with a dignity that would have been absurd had it not been so pitiful.

"Oh, Aunt Polly," choked Pollyanna. "Why, I thought you'd be glad to have him here! I'm sure, I should think you'd be glad—"

Miss Polly raised her hand with a peremptory gesture of silence.Miss Polly's nerves had snapped at last. The "good and kind" of the boy's words were still ringing in her ears, and the old helplessness was almost upon her, she knew. Yet she rallied her forces with the last atom of her will power.

"Pollyanna," she cried sharply, "will you stop using that everlasting word 'glad'! It's 'glad'—'glad'—'glad' from morning till night until I think I shall grow wild!"

From sheer amazement Pollyanna's jaw dropped.

"Why, Aunt Polly," she breathed, "I should think you'd be glad to have me gl—Oh!" she broke off, clapping her hand to her lips and hurrying blindly from the room.

Before the boy had reached the end of the driveway, Pollyanna overtook him.

"Boy! Boy! Jimmy Bean, I want you to know how—how sorry I am," she panted, catching him with a detaining hand.

"Sorry nothin'! I ain't blamin' you," retorted the boy, sullenly. "But I ain't no beggar!" he added, with sudden spirit.

"Of course you aren't! But you mustn't blame auntie," appealed Pollyanna. "Probably I didn't do the introducing right, anyhow; and I reckon I didn't tell her much who you were. She is good and kind, really—she's always been; but I probably didn't explain it right. I do wish I could find some place for you, though!"

The boy shrugged his shoulders and half turned away.

"Never mind. I guess I can find one myself. I ain't no beggar, you know."

Pollyanna was frowning thoughtfully. Of a sudden she turned, her face illumined.

"Say, I'll tell you what I will do! The Ladies' Aid meets this afternoon. I heard Aunt Polly say so. I'll lay your case before them.That's what father always did, when he wanted anything—educating the heathen and new carpets, you know."

The boy turned fiercely.

"Well, I ain't a heathen or a new carpet. Besides—what is a Ladies' Aid?"

Pollyanna stared in shocked disapproval.

"Why, Jimmy Bean, wherever have you been brought up?—not to know what a Ladies' Aid is!"

"Oh, all right—if you ain't tellin'," grunted the boy, turning and beginning to walk away indifferently.

Pollyanna sprang to his side at once.

"It's—it's—why, it's just a lot of ladies that meet and sew and give suppers and raise money and—and talk; that's what a Ladies' Aid is.They're awfully kind—that is, most of mine was, back home. I haven't seen this one here, but they're always good, I reckon. I'm going to tell them about you this afternoon."

Again the boy turned fiercely.

"Not much you will! Maybe you think I'm goin' ter stand 'round an' hear a whole lot o' women call me a beggar, instead of jest one!Not much!"

"Oh, but you wouldn't be there," argued Pollyanna, quickly. "I'd go alone, of course, and tell them."

"You would?"

"Yes, and I'd tell it better this time," hurried on Pollyanna, quick to see the signs of relenting in the boy's face. "And there'd be some of' em, I know, that would be glad to give you a home."

"I'd work—don't forget ter say that," cautioned the boy.

"Of course not," promised Pollyanna, happily, sure now that her point was gained. "Then I'll let you know to-morrow."

"Where?"

"By the road—where I found you to-day; near Mrs. Snow's house."

"All right. I'll be there." The boy paused before he went on slowly: "Maybe I'd better go back, then, for ter-night, ter the Home.You see, I hain't no other place ter stay; and—and I didn't leave till this mornin'. I slipped out. I didn't tell 'em I wasn't comin' back, else they'd pretend I couldn't come—though I'm thinkin' they won't do no worryin' when I don't show up sometime. They ain't like folks, ye know. They don't care!"

"I know," nodded Pollyanna, with understanding eyes. "But I'm sure, when I see you to-morrow, I'll have just a common home and folks that do care all ready for you. Good-by!" she called brightly, as she turned back toward the house.

In the sitting-room window at that moment, Miss Polly, who had been watching the two children, followed with sombre eyes the boy until a bend of the road hid him from sight. Then she sighed, turned, and walked listlesly up-stairs—and Miss Polly did not usually move listlessly. In her ears still was the boy's scornful "you was so good and kind". In her heart was a curious sense of desolation—as of something lost.





Chapter XII. Before the Ladies' Aid


Dinner, which came at noon in the Harrington homestead, was a silent meal on the day of the Ladies' Aid meeting. Pollyanna, it is true, tried to talk; but she did not make a success of it, chiefly because four times she was obliged to break off a "glad" in the middle of it, much to her blushing discomfort. The fifth time it happened, Miss Polly moved her head wearily.

"There, there, child, say it, if you want to," she sighed. "I'm sure I'd rather you did than not if it's going to make all this fuss."

Pollyanna's puckered little face cleared.

"Oh, thank you. I'm afraid it would be pretty hard—not to say it.You see, I've played it so long."

"You've—what?" demanded Aunt Polly.

"Played it—the game, you know, that father—" Pollyanna stopped with a painful blush at finding herself so soon again on forbidden ground.

Aunt Polly frowned and said nothing. The rest of the meal was a silent one.

Pollyanna was not sorry to hear Aunt Polly tell the minister's wife over the telephone, a little later, that she would not be at the Ladies' Aid meeting that afternoon, owing to a headache. When Aunt Polly went up-stairs to her room and closed the door, Pollyanna tried to be sorry for the headache; but she could not help feeling glad that her aunt was not to be present that afternoon when she laid the case of Jimmy Bean before the Ladies' Aid. She could not forget that Aunt Polly had called Jimmy Bean a little beggar; and she did not want Aunt Polly to call him that—before the Ladies' Aid.

Pollyanna knew that the Ladies' Aid met at two o'clock in the chapel next the church, not quite half a mile from home. She planned her going, therefore, so that she should get there a little before three.

"I want them all to be there," she said to herself, "else the very one that wasn't there might be the one who would be wanting to give Jimmy Bean a home; and, of course, two o'clock always means three, really—to Ladies' Aiders."

Quietly, but with confident courage, Pollyanna ascended the chapel steps, pushed open the door and entered the vestibule. A soft babel of feminine chatter and laughter came from the main room. Hesitating only a brief moment, Pollyanna pushed open one of the inner doors.

The chatter dropped to a surprised hush. Pollyanna advanced a little timidly. Now that the time had come, she felt unwontedly shy.After all, these half-strange, half-familiar faces about her were not her own dear Ladies' Aid.

"How do you do, Ladies' Aiders?" she faltered politely. "I'm Pollyanna Whittier. I—I reckon some of you know me, maybe; anyway, I do you—only I don't know you all together this way."

The silence could almost be felt now. Some of the ladies did know this rather extraordinary niece of their fellow-member, and nearly all had heard of her; but not one of them could think of anything to say, just then.

"I—I've come to—to lay the case before you," stammered Pollyanna, after a moment, unconsciously falling into her father's familiar phraseology.

There was a slight rustle.

"Did—did your aunt send you, my dear?" asked Mrs. Ford, the minister's wife.

Pollyanna colored a little.

"Oh, no. I came all by myself. You see, I'm used to Ladies' Aiders. It was Ladies' Aiders that brought me up—with father."

Somebody tittered hysterically, and the minister's wife frowned.

"Yes, dear. What is it?"

"Well, it—it's Jimmy Bean," sighed Pollyanna. "He hasn't any home except the Orphan one, and they're full, and don't want him, anyhow, he thinks; so he wants another. He wants one of the common kind, that has a mother instead of a Matron in it—folks, you know, that'll care. He's ten years old going on eleven. I thought some of you might like him—to live with you, you know."

"Well, did you ever!" murmured a voice, breaking the dazed pause that followed Pollyanna's words.

With anxious eyes Pollyanna swept the circle of faces about her.

"Oh, I forgot to say; he will work," she supplemented eagerly.

Still there was silence; then, coldly, one or two women began to question her. After a time they all had the story and began to talk among themselves, animatedly, not quite pleasantly.

Pollyanna listened with growing anxiety. Some of what was said she could not understand. She did gather, after a time, however, that there was no woman there who had a home to give him, though every woman seemed to think that some of the others might take him, as there were several who had no little boys of their own already in their homes.But there was no one who agreed herself to take him. Then she heard the minister's wife suggest timidly that they, as a society, might perhaps assume his support and education instead of sending quite so much money this year to the little boys in far-away India.

A great many ladies talked then, and several of them talked all at once, and even more loudly and more unpleasantly than before. It seemed that their society was famous for its offering to Hindu missions, and several said they should die of mortification if it should be less this year. Some of what was said at this time Pollyanna again thought she could not have understood, too, for it sounded almost as if they did not care at all what the money did, so long as the sum opposite the name of their society in a certain "report" "headed the list"—and of course that could not be what they meant at all! But it was all very confusing, and not quite pleasant, so that Pollyanna was glad, indeed, when at last she found herself outside in the hushed, sweet air—only she was very sorry, too, for she knew it was not going to be easy, or anything but sad, to tell Jimmy Bean to-morrow that the Ladies' Aid had decided that they would rather send all their money to bring up the little India boys than to save out enough to bring up one little boy in their own town, for which they would not get "a bit of credit in the report", according to the tall lady who wore spectacles.

"Not but that it's good, of course, to send money to the heathen, and I shouldn't want 'em not to send some there," sighed Pollyanna to herself, as she trudged sorrowfully along. "But they acted as if little boys here weren't any account—only little boys 'way off. I should think, though, they'd rather see Jimmy Bean grow—than just a report!"





Chapter XIII. In Pendleton Woods


Pollyanna had not turned her steps toward home, when she left the chapel. She had turned them, instead, toward Pendleton Hill. It had been a hard day, for all it had been a "vacation one" (as she termed the infrequent days when there was no sewing or cooking lesson), and Pollyanna was sure that nothing would do her quite so much good as a walk through the green quiet of Pendleton Woods. Up Pendleton Hill, therefore, she climbed steadily, in spite of the warm sun on her back.

"I don't have to get home till half-past five, anyway," she was telling herself; "and it'll be so much nicer to go around by the way of the woods, even if I do have to climb to get there."

It was very beautiful in the Pendleton Woods, as Pollyanna knew by experience. But to-day it seemed even more delightful than ever, notwithstanding her disappointment over what she must tell Jimmy Bean to-morrow.

"I wish they were up here—all those ladies who talked so loud," sighed Pollyanna to herself, raising her eyes to the patches of vivid blue between the sunlit green of the tree-tops. "Anyhow, if they were up here, I just reckon they'd change and take Jimmy Bean for their little boy, all right," she finished, secure in her conviction, but unable to give a reason for it, even to herself.

Suddenly Pollyanna lifted her head and listened. A dog had barked some distance ahead. A moment later he came dashing toward her, still barking.

"Hullo, doggie—hullo!" Pollyanna snapped her fingers at the dog and looked expectantly down the path. She had seen the dog once before, she was sure. He had been then with the Man, Mr. John Pendleton. She was looking now, hoping to see him. For some minutes she watched eagerly, but he did not appear. Then she turned her attention toward the dog.

The dog, as even Pollyanna could see, was acting strangely. He was still barking—giving little short, sharp yelps, as if of alarm. He was running back and forth, too, in the path ahead. Soon they reached a side path, and down this the little dog fairly flew, only to come back at once, whining and barking.

"Ho! That isn't the way home," laughed Pollyanna, still keeping to the main path.

The little dog seemed frantic now. Back and forth, back and forth, between Pollyanna and the side path he vibrated, barking and whining pitifully. Every quiver of his little brown body, and every glance from his beseeching brown eyes were eloquent with appeal—so eloquent that at last Pollyanna understood, turned, and followed him.

Straight ahead, now, the little dog dashed madly; and it was not long before Pollyanna came upon the reason for it all: a man lying motionless at the foot of a steep, overhanging mass of rock a few yards from the side path.

A twig cracked sharply under Pollyanna's foot, and the man turned his head. With a cry of dismay Pollyanna ran to his side.

"Mr. Pendleton! Oh, are you hurt?"

"Hurt? Oh, no! I'm just taking a siesta in the sunshine," snapped the man irritably. "See here, how much do you know? What can you do? Have you got any sense?"

Pollyanna caught her breath with a little gasp, but—as was her habit—she answered the questions literally, one by one.

"Why, Mr. Pendleton, I—I don't know so very much, and I can't do a great many things; but most of the Ladies' Aiders, except Mrs.Rawson, said I had real good sense. I heard 'em say so one day—they didn't know I heard, though."

The man smiled grimly.

"There, there, child, I beg your pardon, I'm sure; it's only this confounded leg of mine. Now listen." He paused, and with some difficulty reached his hand into his trousers pocket and brought out a bunch of keys, singling out one between his thumb and forefinger. "Straight through the path there, about five minutes' walk, is my house.This key will admit you to the side door under the porte-cochere. Do you know what a porte-cochere is?"

"Oh, yes, sir. Auntie has one with a sun-parlor over it. That's the roof I slept on—only I didn't sleep, you know. They found me."

"Eh? Oh! Well, when you get into the house, go straight through the vestibule and hall to the door at the end. On the big, flat-topped desk in the middle of the room you'll find a telephone. Do you know how to use a telephone?"

"Oh, yes, sir! Why, once when Aunt Polly—"

"Never mind Aunt Polly now," cut in the man scowlingly, as he tried to move himself a little.

"Hunt up Dr. Thomas Chilton's number on the card you'll find somewhere around there—it ought to be on the hook down the side, but it probably won't be. You know a telephone card, I suppose, when you see one!"

"Oh, yes, sir! I just love Aunt Polly's. There's such a lot of queer names, and—"

"Tell Dr. Chilton that John Pendleton is at the foot of Little Eagle Ledge in Pendleton Woods with a broken leg, and to come at once with a stretcher and two men. He'll know what to do besides that. Tell him to come by the path from the house."

"A broken leg? Oh, Mr. Pendleton, how perfectly awful! "shuddered Pollyanna. "But I'm so glad I came! Can't I do—"

"Yes, you can—but evidently you won't! will you go and do what I ask and stop talking," moaned the man, faintly. And, with a little sobbing cry, Pollyanna went.

Pollyanna did not stop now to look up at the patches of blue between the sunlit tops of the trees. She kept her eyes on the ground to make sure that no twig nor stone tripped her hurrying feet.

It was not long before she came in sight of the house. She had seen it before, though never so near as this. She was almost frightened now at the massiveness of the great pile of gray stone with its pillared verandas and its imposing entrance. Pausing only a moment, however, she sped across the big neglected lawn and around the house to the side door under the porte-cochere. Her fingers, stiff from their tight clutch upon the keys, were anything but skilful in their efforts to turn the bolt in the lock; but at last the heavy, carved door swung slowly back on its hinges.

Pollyanna caught her breath. In spite of her feeling of haste, she paused a moment and looked fearfully through the vestibule to the wide, sombre hall beyond, her thoughts in a whirl. This was John Pendleton's house; the house of mystery; the house into which no one but its master entered; the house which sheltered, somewhere—a skeleton. Yet she, Pollyanna, was expected to enter alone these fearsome rooms, and telephone the doctor that the master of the house lay now...

With a little cry Pollyanna, looking neither to the right nor the left, fairly ran through the hall to the door at the end and opened it.

The room was large, and sombre with dark woods and hangings like the hall; but through the west window the sun threw a long shaft of gold across the floor, gleamed dully on the tarnished brass andirons in the fireplace, and touched the nickel of the telephone on the great desk in the middle of the room. It was toward this desk that Pollyanna hurriedly tiptoed.

The telephone card was not on its hook; it was on the floor. But Pollyanna found it, and ran her shaking forefinger down through the C's to "Chilton". In due time she had Dr. Chilton himself at the other end of the wires, and was tremblingly delivering her message and answering the doctor's terse, pertinent questions. This done, she hung up the receiver and drew a long breath of relief.

Only a brief glance did Pollyanna give about her; then, with a confused vision in her eyes of crimson draperies, book-lined walls, a littered floor, an untidy desk, innumerable closed doors (any one of which might conceal a skeleton), and everywhere dust, dust, dust, she fled back through the hall to the great carved door, still half open as she had left it.

In what seemed, even to the injured man, an incredibly short time, Pollyanna was back in the woods at the man's side.

"Well, what is the trouble? Couldn't you get in?" he demanded.

Pollyanna opened wide her eyes.

"Why, of course I could! I'm here," she answered. "As if I'd be here if I hadn't got in! And the doctor will be right up just as soon as possible with the men and things. He said he knew just where you were, so I didn't stay to show him. I wanted to be with you."

"Did you?" smiled the man, grimly. "Well, I can't say I admire your taste. I should think you might find pleasanter companions."

"Do you mean—because you're so—cross?"

"Thanks for your frankness. Yes."

Pollyanna laughed softly.

"But you're only cross outside—You arn't cross inside a bit!"

"Indeed! How do you know that?" asked the man, trying to change the position of his head without moving the rest of his body.

"Oh, lots of ways; there—like that—the way you act with the dog," she added, pointing to the long, slender hand that rested on the dog's sleek head near him. "It's funny how dogs and cats know the insides of folks better than other folks do, isn't it? Say, I'm going to hold your head," she finished abruptly.

The man winced several times and groaned once; softly while the change was being made; but in the end he found Pollyanna's lap a very welcome substitute for the rocky hollow in which his head had lain before.

"Well, that is—better," he murmured faintly.

He did not speak again for some time. Pollyanna, watching his face, wondered if he were asleep. She did not think he was. He looked as if his lips were tight shut to keep back moans of pain. Pollyanna herself almost cried aloud as she looked at his great, strong body lying there so helpless. One hand, with fingers tightly clenched, lay outflung, motionless. The other, limply open, lay on the dog's head. The dog, his wistful, eager eyes on his master's face, was motionless, too.

Minute by minute the time passed. The sun dropped lower in the west and the shadows grew deeper under the trees. Pollyanna sat so still she hardly seemed to breathe. A bird alighted fearlessly within reach of her hand, and a squirrel whisked his bushy tail on a tree-branch almost under her nose—yet with his bright little eyes all the while on the motionless dog.

At last the dog pricked up his cars and whined softly; then he gave a short, sharp bark. The next moment Pollyanna heard voices, and very soon their owners appeared three men carrying a stretcher and various other articles.

The tallest of the party—a smooth-shaven, kind-eyed man whom Pollyanna knew by sight as "Dr. Chilton"—advanced cheerily.

"Well, my little lady, playing nurse?"

"Oh, no, sir," smiled Pollyanna. "I've only held his head—I haven't given him a mite of medicine. But I'm glad I was here."

"So am I," nodded the doctor, as he turned his absorbed attention to the injured man.





Chapter XIV. Just a Matter of Jelly


Pollyanna was a little late for supper on the night of the accident to John Pendleton; but, as it happened, she escaped without reproof.

Nancy met her at the door.

"Well, if I ain't glad ter be settin' my two eyes on you," she sighed in obvious relief. "It's half-past six!"

"I know it," admitted Pollyanna anxiously; "but I'm not to blame—truly I'm not. And I don't think even Aunt Polly will say I am, either."

"She won't have the chance," retorted Nancy, with huge satisfaction. "She's gone."

"Gone!" gasped Pollyanna. "You don't mean that I've driven her away?" Through Pollyanna's mind at the moment trooped remorseful memories of the morning with its unwanted boy, cat, and dog, and its unwelcome "glad" and forbidden "father" that would spring to her forgetful little tongue. "Oh, I didn't drive her away?"

"Not much you did," scoffed Nancy. "Her cousin died suddenly down to Boston, and she had ter go. She had one o' them yeller telegram letters after you went away this afternoon, and she won't be back for three days. Now I guess we're glad all right. We'll be keepin' house tergether, jest you and me, all that time. We will, we will!"

Pollyanna looked shocked.

"Glad! Oh, Nancy, when it's a funeral?"

"Oh, but 'twa'n't the funeral I was glad for, Miss Pollyanna. It was—" Nancy stopped abruptly. A shrewd twinkle came into her eyes. "Why, Miss Pollyanna, as if it wa'n't yerself that was teachin' me ter play the game," she reproached her gravely.

Pollyanna puckered her forehead into a troubled frown.

"I can't help it, Nancy," she argued with a shake of her head. "It must be that there are some things that 'tisn't right to play the game on—and I'm sure funerals is one of them. There's nothing in a funeral to be glad about."

Nancy chuckled.

"We can be glad 'tain't our'n," she observed demurely. But Pollyanna did not hear. She had begun to tell of the accident; and in a moment Nancy, open-mouthed, was listening.

At the appointed place the next afternoon, Pollyanna met Jimmy Bean according to agreement. As was to be expected, of course, Jimmy showed keen disappointment that the Ladies' Aid preferred a little India boy to himself.

"Well, maybe 'tis natural," he sighed. "Of course things you don't know about are always nicer'n things you do, same as the pertater on'tother side of the plate is always the biggest. But I wish I looked that way ter somebody 'way off. Wouldn't it be jest great, now, if only somebody over in India wanted me?"

Pollyanna clapped her hands.

"Why, of course! That's the very thing, Jimmy! I'll write to my Ladies' Aiders about you. They aren't over in India; they're only out West—but that's awful far away, just the same. I reckon you'd think so if you'd come all the way here as I did!"

Jimmy's face brightened.

"Do you think they would—truly—take me?" he asked.

"Of course they would! Don't they take little boys in India to bring up? Well, they can just play you are the little India boy this time. I reckon you're far enough away to make a report, all right.You wait. I'll write 'em. I'll write Mrs. White. No, I'll write Mrs.Jones. Mrs. White has got the most money, but Mrs. Jones gives the most—which is kind of funny, isn't it?—when you think of it. But I reckon some of the Aiders will take you."

"All right—but don't furgit ter say I'll work fur my board an' keep," put in Jimmy. "I ain't no beggar, an' biz'ness is biz'ness, even with Ladies' Aiders, I'm thinkin'." He hesitated, then added: "An' I s'pose I better stay where I be fur a spell yet—till you hear."

"Of course," nodded Pollyanna emphatically. "Then I'll know just where to find you. And they'll take you—I'm sure you're far enough away for that. Didn't Aunt Polly take—Say!" she broke off, suddenly, "do you suppose I was Aunt Polly's little girl from India?"

"Well, if you ain't the queerest kid," grinned Jimmy, as he turned away.

It was about a week after the accident in Pendleton Woods that Pollyanna said to her aunt one morning:

"Aunt Polly, please would you mind very much if I took Mrs.Snow's calf's-foot jelly this week to some one else? I'm sure Mrs.Snow wouldn't—this once."

"Dear me, Pollyanna, what ARE you up to now?" sighed her aunt. "You ARE the most extraordinary child!"

Pollyanna frowned a little anxiously.

"Aunt Polly, please, what is extraordinary? If you're extraordinary you can't be ORdinary, can you?"

"You certainly can not."

"Oh, that's all right, then. I'm glad I'm ex traordinary," sighed Pollyanna, her face clearing. "You see, Mrs. White used to say Mrs.Rawson was a very ordinary woman—and she disliked Mrs. Rawson something awful. They were always fight—I mean, father had—that is, I mean, we had more trouble keeping peace between them than we did between any of the rest of the Aiders," corrected Pollyanna, a little breathless from her efforts to steer between the Scylla of her father's past commands in regard to speaking of church quarrels, and the Charybdis of her aunt's present commands in regard to speaking of her father.

"Yes, yes, well, never mind," interposed Aunt Polly, a trifle impatiently. "You do run on so, Pollyanna, and no matter what we're talking about you always bring up at those Ladies' Aiders!"

"Yes'm," smiled Pollyanna, cheerfully, "I reckon I do, maybe. But you see they used to bring me up, and—"

"That will do, Pollyanna," interrupted a cold voice. "Now what is it about this jelly?"

"Nothing, Aunt Polly, truly, that you would mind, I'm sure. You let me take jelly to her, so I thought you would to him—this once. You see, broken legs aren't like—like lifelong invalids, so his won't last forever as Mrs. Snow's does, and she can have all the rest of the things after just once or twice."

"'Him'? 'He'? 'Broken leg'? What are you talking about, Pollyanna?"

Pollyanna stared; then her face relaxed.

"Oh, I forgot. I reckon you didn't know. You see, it happened while you were gone. It was the very day you went that I found him in the woods, you know; and I had to unlock his house and telephone for the men and the doctor, and hold his head, and everything. And of course then I came away and haven't seen him since. But when Nancy made the jelly for Mrs. Snow this week I thought how nice it would be if I could take it to him instead of her, just this once. Aunt Polly, may I?"

"Yes, yes, I suppose so," acquiesced Miss Polly, a little wearily. "Who did you say he was?"

"The Man. I mean, Mr. John Pendleton."

Miss Polly almost sprang from her chair.

"John Pendleton!"

"Yes. Nancy told me his name. Maybe you know him."

Miss Polly did not answer this. Instead she asked:

"Do you know him?"

Pollyanna nodded.

"Oh, yes. He always speaks and smiles—now. He's only cross outside, you know. I'll go and get the jelly. Nancy had it 'most fixed when I came in," finished Pollyanna, already halfway across the room.

"Pollyanna, wait! Miss Polly's voice was suddenly very stern.I've changed my mind. I would prefer that Mrs. Snow had that jelly to-day—as usual. That is all. You may go now."

Pollyanna's face fell.

"Oh, but Aunt Polly, hers will last. She can always be sick and have things, you know; but his is just a broken leg, and legs don't last—I mean, broken ones. He's had it a whole week now."

"Yes, I remember. I heard Mr. John Pendleton had met with an accident," said Miss Polly, a little stiffly; "but—I do not care to be sending jelly to John Pendleton, Pollyanna."

"I know, he is cross—outside," admitted Pollyanna, sadly, "so I suppose you don't like him. But I wouldn't say 'twas you sent it. I'd say'twas me. I like him. I'd be glad to send him jelly."

Miss Polly began to shake her head again. Then, suddenly, she stopped, and asked in a curiously quiet voice:

"Does he know who you—are, Pollyanna?"

The little girl sighed.

"I reckon not. I told him my name, once, but he never calls me it—never."

"Does he know where you—live?"

"Oh, no. I never told him that."

"Then he doesn't know you're my—niece?"

"I don't think so."

For a moment there was silence. Miss Polly was looking at Pollyanna with eyes that did not seem to see her at all. The little girl, shifting impatiently from one small foot to the other, sighed audibly.Then Miss Polly roused herself with a start.

"Very well, Pollyanna," she said at last, still in that queer voice, so unlike her own; "you may you may take the jelly to Mr. Pendleton as your own gift. But understand: I do not send it. Be very sure that he does not think I do!"

"Yes'm—no'm—thank you, Aunt Polly," exulted Pollyanna, as she flew through the door.





Chapter XV. Dr. Chilton


The great gray pile of masonry looked very different to Pollyanna when she made her second visit to the house of Mr. John Pendleton.Windows were open, an elderly woman was hanging out clothes in the back yard, and the doctor's gig stood under the porte-cochere.

As before Pollyanna went to the side door. This time she rang the bell—her fingers were not stiff to-day from a tight clutch on a bunch of keys.

A familiar-looking small dog bounded up the steps to greet her, but there was a slight delay before the woman who had been hanging out the clothes opened the door.

"If you please, I've brought some calf 's-foot jelly for Mr.Pendleton," smiled Pollyanna.

"Thank you," said the woman, reaching for the bowl in the little girl's hand. "Who shall I say sent it? And it's calf's-foot jelly?"

The doctor, coming into the hall at that moment, heard the woman's words and saw the disappointed look on Pollyanna's face. He stepped quickly forward.

"Ah! Some calf's-foot jelly?" he asked genially. "That will be fine!Maybe you'd like to see our patient, eh?"

"Oh, yes, sir," beamed Pollyanna; and the woman, in obedience to a nod from the doctor, led the way down the hall at once, though plainly with vast surprise on her face.

Behind the doctor, a young man (a trained nurse from the nearest city) gave a disturbed exclamation.

"But, Doctor, didn't Mr. Pendleton give orders not to admit—anyone?"

"Oh, yes," nodded the doctor, imperturbably. "But I'm giving orders now. I'll take the risk." Then he added whimsically: "You don't know, of course; but that little girl is better than a six-quart bottle of tonic any day. If anything or anybody can take the grouch out of Pendleton this afternoon, she can. That's why I sent her in."

"Who is she?"

For one brief moment the doctor hesitated.

"She's the niece of one of our best known residents. Her name is Pollyanna Whittier. I—I don't happen to enjoy a very extensive personal acquaintance with the little lady as yet; but lots of my patients do—I'm thankful to say!"

The nurse smiled.

"Indeed! And what are the special ingredients of this wonder-working—tonic of hers?"

The doctor shook his head.

"I don't know. As near as I can find out it is an overwhelming, unquenchable gladness for everything that has happened or is going to happen. At any rate, her quaint speeches are constantly being repeated to me, and, as near as I can make out, 'just being glad' is the tenor of most of them. All is," he added, with another whimsical smile, as he stepped out on to the porch, "I wish I could prescribe her—and buy her—as I would a box of pills;—though if there gets to be many of her in the world, you and I might as well go to ribbon-selling and ditch-digging for all the money we'd get out of nursing and doctoring," he laughed, picking up the reins and stepping into the gig.

Pollyanna, meanwhile, in accordance with the doctor's orders, was being escorted to John Pendleton's rooms.

Her way led through the great library at the end of the hall, and, rapid as was her progress through it, Pollyanna saw at once that great changes had taken place. The book-lined walls and the crimson curtains were the same; but there was no litter on the floor, no untidiness on the desk, and not so much as a grain of dust in sight. The telephone card hung in its proper place, and the brass andirons had been polished. One of the mysterious doors was open, and it was toward this that the maid led the way. A moment later Pollyanna found herself in a sumptuously furnished bedroom while the maid was saying in a frightened voice:

"If you please, sir, here—here's a little girl with some jelly. The doctor said I was to—to bring her in."

The next moment Pollyanna found herself alone with a very cross-looking man lying flat on his back in bed.

"See here, didn't I say—" began an angry voice. "Oh, it's you!" it broke off not very graciously, as Pollyanna advanced toward the bed.

"Yes, sir," smiled Pollyanna. "Oh, I'm so glad they let me in! You see, at first the lady 'most took my jelly, and I was so afraid I wasn't going to see you at all. Then the doctor came, and he said I might.Wasn't he lovely to let me see you?"

In spite of himself the man's lips twitched into a smile; but all he said was "Humph!"

"And I've brought you some jelly," resumed Pollyanna, "—calf's-foot. I hope you like it?" There was a rising inflection in her voice.

"Never ate it." The fleeting smile had gone, and the scowl had come back to the man's face.

For a brief instant Pollyanna's countenance showed disappointment; but it cleared as she set the bowl of jelly down.

"Didn't you? Well, if you didn't, then you can't know you don't like it, anyhow, can you? So I reckon I'm glad you haven't, after all.Now, if you knew—"

"Yes, yes; well, there's one thing I know all right, and that is that I'm flat on my back right here this minute, and that I'm liable to stay here—till doomsday, I guess."

Pollyanna looked shocked.

"Oh, no! It couldn't be till doomsday, you know, when the angel Gabriel blows his trumpet, unless it should come quicker than we think it will—oh, of course, I know the Bible says it may come quicker than we think, but I don't think it will—that is, of course I believe the Bible; but I mean I don't think it will come as much quicker as it would if it should come now, and—"

John Pendleton laughed suddenly—and aloud. The nurse, coming in at that moment, heard the laugh, and beat a hurried—but a very silent—retreat. He had the air of a frightened cook who, seeing the danger of a breath of cold air striking a half-done cake, hastily shuts the oven door.

"Aren't you getting a little mixed?" asked John Pendleton of Pollyanna.

The little girl laughed.

"Maybe. But what I mean is, that legs don't last—broken ones, you know—like lifelong invalids, same as Mrs. Snow has got. So yours won't last till doomsday at all. I should think you could be glad of that."

"Oh, I am," retorted the man grimly.

"And you didn't break but one. You can be glad 'twasn't two." Pollyanna was warming to her task.

"Of course! So fortunate," sniffed the man, with uplifted eyebrows; "looking at it from that standpoint, I suppose I might be glad I wasn't a centipede and didn't break fifty!"

Pollyanna chuckled.

"Oh, that's the best yet," she crowed. "I know what a centipede is; they've got lots of legs. And you can be glad—"

"Oh, of course," interrupted the man, sharply, all the old bitterness coming back to his voice; "I can be glad, too, for all the rest, I suppose—the nurse, and the doctor, and that confounded woman in the kitchen!"

"Why, yes, sir—only think how bad 'twould be if you didn't have them!"

"Well, I—eh?" he demanded sharply.

"Why, I say, only think how bad it would be if you didn't have' em—and you lying here like this!"

"As if that wasn't the very thing that was at the bottom of the whole matter," retorted the man, testily, "because I am lying here like this! And yet you expect me to say I'm glad because of a fool woman who disarranges the whole house and calls it 'regulating,' and a man who aids and abets her in it, and calls it 'nursing,' to say nothing of the doctor who eggs 'em both on—and the whole bunch of them, meanwhile, expecting me to pay them for it, and pay them well, too!"

Pollyanna frowned sympathetically.

"Yes, I know. That part is too bad—about the money—when you've been saving it, too, all this time."

"When—eh?"

"Saving it—buying beans and fish balls, you know. Say, do you like beans?—or do you like turkey better, only on account of the sixty cents?"

"Look a-here, child, what are you talking about?"

Pollyanna smiled radiantly.

"About your money, you know—denying yourself, and saving it for the heathen. You see, I found out about it. Why, Mr. Pendleton, that's one of the ways I knew you weren't cross inside. Nancy told me."

The man's jaw dropped.

"Nancy told you I was saving money for the—Well, may I inquire who Nancy is?"

"Our Nancy. She works for Aunt Polly."

"Aunt Polly! Well, who is Aunt Polly?"

"She's Miss Polly Harrington. I live with her."

The man made a sudden movement.

"Miss—Polly—Harrington!" he breathed. "You live with—her!"

"Yes, I'm her niece. She's taken me to bring up—on account of my mother, you know," faltered Pollyanna, in a low voice. "She was her sister. And after father—went to be with her and the rest of us in Heaven, there wasn't anyone left for me down here but the Ladies' Aid; so she took me."

The man did not answer. His face, as he lay back on the pillow now, was very white—so white that Pollyanna was frightened. She rose uncertainly to her feet.

"I reckon maybe I'd better go now," she proposed. "I—I hope you'll like—the jelly."

The man turned his head suddenly, and opened his eyes. There was a curious longing in their dark depths which even Pollyanna saw, and at which she marvelled.

"And so you are—Miss Polly Harrington's niece," he said gently.

"Yes, sir."

Still the man's dark eyes lingered on her face, until Pollyanna, feeling vaguely restless, murmured:

"I—I suppose you know—her."

John Pendleton's lips curved in an odd smile.

"Oh, yes, I know her." He hesitated, then went on, still with that curious smile. "But—you don't mean—you can't mean that it was Miss Polly Harrington who sent that jelly—to me?" he said slowly.

Pollyanna looked distressed.

"N-no, sir, she didn't. She said I must be very sure not to let you think she did send it. But I—"

"I thought as much," vouchsafed the man, shortly, turning away his head. And Pollyanna, still more distressed, tiptoed from the room.

Under the porte-cochere she found the doctor waiting in his gig.The nurse stood on the steps.

"Well, Miss Pollyanna, may I have the pleasure of seeing you home?" asked the doctor smilingly. "I started to drive on a few minutes ago; then it occurred to me that I'd wait for you."

"Thank you, sir. I'm glad you did. I just love to ride," beamed Pollyanna, as he reached out his hand to help her in.

"Do you?" smiled the doctor, nodding his head in farewell to the young man on the steps. "Well, as near as I can judge, there are a good many things you 'love' to do—eh?" he added, as they drove briskly away.

Pollyanna laughed.

"Why, I don't know. I reckon perhaps there are," she admitted. "I like to do 'most everything that's living. Of course I don't like the other things very well—sewing, and reading out loud, and all that. But they aren't living."

"No? What are they, then?"

"Aunt Polly says they're 'learning to live'," sighed Pollyanna, with a rueful smile.

The doctor smiled now—a little queerly.

"Does she? Well, I should think she might say—just that."

"Yes," responded Pollyanna. "But I don't see it that way at all. I don't think you have to learn how to live. I didn't, anyhow."

The doctor drew a long sigh.

"After all, I'm afraid some of us—do have to, little girl," he said.Then, for a time he was silent. Pollyanna, stealing a glance at his face, felt vaguely sorry for him. He looked so sad. She wished, uneasily, that she could "do something". It was this, perhaps, that caused her to say in a timid voice:

"Dr. Chilton, I should think being a doctor would, be the very gladdest kind of a business there was."

The doctor turned in surprise.

"'Gladdest'!—when I see so much suffering always, everywhere I go?" he cried.

She nodded.

"I know; but you're helping it—don't you see?—and of course you're glad to help it! And so that makes you the gladdest of any of us, all the time."

The doctor's eyes filled with sudden hot tears. The doctor's life was a singularly lonely one. He had no wife and no home save his two-room office in a boarding house. His profession was very dear to him.Looking now into Pollyanna's shining eyes, he felt as if a loving hand had been suddenly laid on his head in blessing. He knew, too, that never again would a long day's work or a long night's weariness be quite without that new-found exaltation that had come to him through Pollyanna's eyes.

"God bless you, little girl," he said unsteadily. Then, with the bright smile his patients knew and loved so well, he added: "And I'm thinking, after all, that it was the doctor, quite as much as his patients, that needed a draft of that tonic!" All of which puzzled Pollyanna very much—until a chipmunk, running across the road, drove the whole matter from her mind.

The doctor left Pollyanna at her own door, smiled at Nancy, who was sweeping off the front porch, then drove rapidly away.

"I've had a perfectly beautiful ride with the doctor," announced Pollyanna, bounding up the steps. "He's lovely, Nancy!"

"Is he?"

"Yes. And I told him I should think his business would be the very gladdest one there was."

"What!—goin' ter see sick folks—an' folks what ain't sick but thinks they is, which is worse?" Nancy's face showed open skepticism.

Pollyanna laughed gleefully.

"Yes. That's 'most what he said, too; but there is a way to be glad, even then. Guess!"

Nancy frowned in meditation. Nancy was getting so she could play this game of "being glad" quite successfully, she thought. She rather enjoyed studying out Pollyanna's "posers," too, as she called some of the little girl's questions.

"Oh, I know," she chuckled. "It's just the opposite from what you told Mis' Snow."

"Opposite?" repeated Pollyanna, obviously puzzled.

"Yes. You told her she could be glad because other folks wasn't like her—all sick, you know."

"Yes," nodded Pollyanna.

"Well, the doctor can be glad because he isn't like other folks—the sick ones, I mean, what he doctors," finished Nancy in triumph.

It was Pollyanna's turn to frown.

"Why, y-yes," she admitted. "Of course that is one way, but it isn't the way I said; and—someway, I don't seem to quite like the sound of it. It isn't exactly as if he said he was glad they were sick, but—You do play the game so funny, sometimes Nancy," she sighed, as she went into the house.

Pollyanna found her aunt in the sitting room.

"Who was that man—the one who drove into the yard, Pollyanna?" questioned the lady a little sharply.

"Why, Aunt Polly, that was Dr. Chilton! Don't you know him?"

"Dr. Chilton! What was he doing—here?"

"He drove me home. Oh, and I gave the jelly to Mr. Pendleton, and—"

Miss Polly lifted her head quickly.

"Pollyanna, he did not think I sent it?"

"Oh, no, Aunt Polly. I told him you didn't."

Miss Polly grew a sudden vivid pink.

"You told him I didn't!"

Pollyanna opened wide her eyes at the remonstrative dismay in her aunt's voice.

"Why, Aunt Polly, you said to!"

Aunt Polly sighed.

"I said, Pollyanna, that I did not send it, and for you to be very sure that he did not think I did!—which is a very different matter from telling him outright that I did not send it." And she turned vexedly away.

"Dear me! Well, I don't see where the difference is," sighed Pollyanna, as she went to hang her hat on the one particular hook in the house upon which Aunt Polly had said that it must be hung.





Chapter XVI. A Red Rose and a Lace Shawl


It was on a rainy day about a week after Pollyanna's visit to Mr.John Pendleton, that Miss Polly was driven by Timothy to an early afternoon committee meeting of the Ladies' Aid Society. When she returned at three o'clock, her cheeks were a bright, pretty pink, and her hair, blown by the damp wind, had fluffed into kinks and curls wherever the loosened pins had given leave.

Pollyanna had never before seen her aunt look like this.

"Oh—oh—oh! Why, Aunt Polly, you've got 'em, too," she cried rapturously, dancing round and round her aunt, as that lady entered the sitting-room.

"Got what, you impossible child?"

Pollyanna was still revolving round and round her aunt.

"And I never knew you had 'em! Can folks have 'em when you don't know they've got 'em? Do you suppose I could?—'fore I get to Heaven, I mean," she cried, pulling out with eager fingers the straight locks above her ears. "But then, they wouldn't be black, if they did come. You can't hide the black part."

"Pollyanna, what does all this mean?" demanded Aunt Polly, hurriedly removing her hat, and trying to smooth back her disordered hair.

"No, no—please, Aunt Polly!" Pollyanna's jubilant voice turned to one of distressed appeal. "Don't smooth 'em out! It's those that I'm talking about—those darling little black curls. Oh, Aunt Polly, they're so pretty!"

"Nonsense! What do you mean, Pollyanna, by going to the Ladies' Aid the other day in that absurd fashion about that beggar boy?"

"But it isn't nonsense," urged Pollyanna, answering only the first of her aunt's remarks. "You don't know how pretty you look with your hair like that! Oh, Aunt Polly, please, mayn't I do your hair like I did Mrs. Snow's, and put in a flower? I'd so love to see you that way! Why, you'd be ever so much prettier than she was!"

"Pollyanna!" (Miss Polly spoke very sharply—all the more sharply because Pollyanna's words had given her an odd throb of joy: when before had anybody cared how she, or her hair looked? When before had anybody "loved" to see her "pretty"?) "Pollyanna, you did not answer my question. Why did you go to the Ladies' Aid in that absurd fashion?"

"Yes'm, I know; but, please, I didn't know it was absurd until I went and found out they'd rather see their report grow than Jimmy.So then I wrote to my Ladies' Aiders—'cause Jimmy is far away from them, you know; and I thought maybe he could be their little India boy same as—Aunt Polly, was I your little India girl? And, Aunt Polly, you will let me do your hair, won't you?"

Aunt Polly put her hand to her throat—the old, helpless feeling was upon her, she knew.

"But, Pollyanna, when the ladies told me this afternoon how you came to them, I was so ashamed! I—"

Pollyanna began to dance up and down lightly on her toes.

"You didn't!—You didn't say I couldn't do your hair," she crowed triumphantly, "and so I'm sure it means just the other way 'round, sort of—like it did the other day about Mr. Pendleton's jelly that you didn't send, but didn't want me to say you didn't send, you know. Now wait just where you are. I'll get a comb."

"But Pollyanna, Pollyanna," remonstrated Aunt Polly, following the little girl from the room and panting up-stairs after her.

"Oh, did you come up here?" Pollyanna greeted her at the door of Miss Polly's own room. "That'll be nicer yet! I've got the comb. Now sit down, please, right here. Oh, I'm so glad you let me do it!"

"But, Pollyanna, I—I—"

Miss Polly did not finish her sentence. To her helpless amazement she found herself in the low chair before the dressing table, with her hair already tumbling about her ears under ten eager, but very gentle fingers.

"Oh, my! what pretty hair you've got," prattled Pollyanna; "and there's so much more of it than Mrs. Snow has, too! But, of course, you need more, anyhow, because you're well and can go to places where folks can see it. My! I reckon folks'll be glad when they do see it—and surprised, too, 'cause you've hid it so long. Why, Aunt Polly, I'll make you so pretty everybody'll just love to look at you!"

"Pollyanna!" gasped a stifled but shocked voice from a veil of hair, "I—I'm sure I don't know why I'm letting you do this silly thing."

"Why, Aunt Polly, I should think you'd be glad to have folks like to look at you! Don't you like to look at pretty things? I'm ever so much happier when I look at pretty folks, 'cause when I look at the other kind I'm so sorry for them."

"But—but—"

"And I just love to do folks' hair," purred Pollyanna, contentedly. "I did quite a lot of the Ladies' Aiders'—but there wasn't any of them so nice as yours. Mrs. White's was pretty nice, though, and she looked just lovely one day when I dressed her up in—Oh, Aunt Polly, I've just happened to think of something! But it's a secret, and I sha'n't tell. Now your hair is almost done, and pretty quick I'm going to leave you just a minute; and you must promise—promise—promise not to stir nor peek, even, till I come back. Now remember!" she finished, as she ran from the room.

Aloud Miss Polly said nothing. To herself she said that of course she should at once undo the absurd work of her niece's fingers, and put her hair up properly again. As for "peeking" just as if she cared how—

At that moment—unaccountably—Miss Polly caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror of the dressing table. And what she saw sent such a flush of rosy color to her cheeks that—she only flushed the more at the sight.

She saw a face—not young, it is true—but just now alight with excitement and surprise. The cheeks were a pretty pink. The eyes sparkled. The hair, dark, and still damp from the outdoor air, lay in loose waves about the forehead and curved back over the ears in wonderfully becoming lines, with softening little curls here and there.

So amazed and so absorbed was Miss Polly with what she saw in the glass that she quite forgot her determination to do over her hair, until she heard Pollyanna enter the room again. Before she could move, then, she felt a folded something slipped across her eyes and tied in the back.

"Pollyanna, Pollyanna! What are you doing?" she cried.

Pollyanna chuckled.

"That's just what I don't want you to know, Aunt Polly, and I was afraid you would peek, so I tied on the handkerchief. Now sit still. It won't take but just a minute, then I'll let you see."

"But, Pollyanna," began Miss Polly, struggling blindly to her feet, "you must take this off! You—child, child! what are you doing?" she gasped, as she felt a soft something slipped about her shoulders.

Pollyanna only chuckled the more gleefully. With trembling fingers she was draping about her aunt's shoulders the fleecy folds of a beautiful lace shawl, yellowed from long years of packing away, and fragrant with lavender. Pollyanna had found the shawl the week before when Nancy had been regulating the attic; and it had occurred to her to-day that there was no reason why her aunt, as well as Mrs. White of her Western home, should not be "dressed up".

Her task completed, Pollyanna surveyed her work with eyes that approved, but that saw yet one touch wanting. Promptly, therefore, she pulled her aunt toward the sun-parlor where she could see a belated red rose blooming on the trellis within reach of her hand.

"Pollyanna, what are you doing? Where are you taking me to?" recoiled Aunt Polly, vainly trying to hold herself back. "Pollyanna, I shall not—"

"It's just to the sun-parlor—only a minute! I'll have you ready now quicker'n no time," panted Pollyanna, reaching for the rose and thrusting it into the soft hair above Miss Polly's left ear. "There!" she exulted, untying the knot of the handkerchief and flinging the bit of linen far from her. "Oh, Aunt Polly, now I reckon you'll be glad I dressed you up!"

For one dazed moment Miss Polly looked at her bedecked self, and at her surroundings; then she gave a low cry and fled to her room.Pollyanna, following the direction of her aunt's last dismayed gaze, saw, through the open windows of the sun-parlor, the horse and gig turning into the driveway. She recognized at once the man who held the reins.Delightedly she leaned forward.

"Dr. Chilton, Dr. Chilton! Did you want to see me? I'm up here."

"Yes," smiled the doctor, a little gravely. "Will you come down, please?"

In the bedroom Pollyanna found a flushed-faced, angry-eyed woman plucking at the pins that held a lace shawl in place.

"Pollyanna, how could you?" moaned the woman. "To think of your rigging me up like this, and then letting me—be seen!"

Pollyanna stopped in dismay.

"But you looked lovely—perfectly lovely, Aunt Polly; and—"

"'Lovely'!" scorned the woman, flinging the shawl to one side and attacking her hair with shaking fingers.

"Oh, Aunt Polly, please, please let the hair stay!"

"Stay? Like this? As if I would!" And Miss Polly pulled the locks so tightly back that the last curl lay stretched dead at the ends of her fingers.

"O dear! And you did look so pretty," almost sobbed Pollyanna, as she stumbled through the door.

Down-stairs Pollyanna found the doctor waiting in his gig.

"I've prescribed you for a patient, and he's sent me to get the prescription filled," announced the doctor. "Will you go?"

"You mean—an errand—to the drug store?" asked Pollyanna, a little uncertainly. "I used to go some—for the Ladies' Aiders."

The doctor shook his head with a smile.

"Not exactly. It's Mr. John Pendleton. He would like to see you to-day, if you'll be so good as to come. It's stopped raining, so I drove down after you. Will you come? I'll call for you and bring you back before six o'clock."

"I'd love to!" exclaimed Pollyanna. "Let me ask Aunt Polly."

In a few moments she returned, hat in hand, but with rather a sober face.

"Didn't—your aunt want you to go?" asked the doctor, a little diffidently, as they drove away.

"Y-yes," sighed Pollyanna. "She—she wanted me to go too much, I'm afraid."

"Wanted you to go too much!"

Pollyanna sighed again.

"Yes. I reckon she meant she didn't want me there. You see, she said: 'Yes, yes, run along, run along—do! I wish you'd gone before.'"

The doctor smiled—but with his lips only. His eyes were very grave. For some time he said nothing; then, a little hesitatingly, he asked:

"Wasn't it—your aunt I saw with you a few minutes ago—in the window of the sun-parlor?"

Pollyanna drew a long breath.

"Yes, that's what's the whole trouble, I suppose. You see I'd dressed her up in a perfectly lovely lace shawl I found up-stairs, and I'd fixed her hair and put on a rose, and she looked so pretty. Didn't you think she looked just lovely?"

For a moment the doctor did not answer. When he did speak his voice was so low Pollyanna could but just hear the words.

"Yes, Pollyanna, I—I thought she did look—just lovely."

"Did you? I'm so glad! I'll tell her," nodded the little girl, contentedly.

To her surprise the doctor gave a sudden exclamation.

"Never! Pollyanna, I—I'm afraid I shall have to ask you not to tell her—that."

"Why, Dr. Chilton! Why not? I should think you'd be glad—"

"But she might not be," cut in the doctor.

Pollyanna considered this for a moment.

"That's so—maybe she wouldn't," she sighed. "I remember now; 'twas 'cause she saw you that she ran. And she—she spoke afterwards about her being seen in that rig."

"I thought as much," declared the doctor, under his breath.

"Still, I don't see why," maintained Pollyanna, "—when she looked so pretty!"

The doctor said nothing. He did not speak again, indeed, until they were almost to the great stone house in which John Pendleton lay with a broken leg.





Chapter XVII. "Just Like a Book"


John Pendleton greeted Pollyanna to-day with a smile.

"Well, Miss Pollyanna, I'm thinking you must be a very forgiving little person, else you wouldn't have come to see me again to-day."

"Why, Mr. Pendleton, I was real glad to come, and I'm sure I don't see why I shouldn't be, either."

"Oh, well, you know, I was pretty cross with you, I'm afraid, both the other day when you so kindly brought me the jelly, and that time when you found me with the broken leg at first. By the way, too, I don't think I've ever thanked you for that. Now I'm sure that even you would admit that you were very forgiving to come and see me, after such ungrateful treatment as that!"

Pollyanna stirred uneasily.

"But I was glad to find you—that is, I don't mean I was glad your leg was broken, of course," she corrected hurriedly.

John Pendleton smiled.

"I understand. Your tongue does get away with you once in a while, doesn't it, Miss Pollyanna? I do thank you, however; and I consider you a very brave little girl to do what you did that day. I thank you for the jelly, too," he added in a lighter voice.

"Did you like it?" asked Pollyanna with interest.

"Very much. I suppose—there isn't any more to-day that—that Aunt Polly didn't send, is there?" he asked, with an odd smile.

His visitor looked distressed.

"N-no, sir." She hesitated, then went on with heightened color. "Please, Mr. Pendleton, I didn't mean to be rude the other day when I said Aunt Polly did not send the jelly."

There was no answer. John Pendleton was not smiling now. He was looking straight ahead of him with eyes that seemed to be gazing through and beyond the object before them. After a time he drew a long sigh and turned to Pollyanna. When he spoke his voice carried the old nervous fretfulness.

"Well, well, this will never do at all! I didn't send for you to see me moping this time. Listen! Out in the library—the big room where the telephone is, you know—you will find a carved box on the lower shelf of the big case with glass doors in the corner not far from the fireplace.That is, it'll be there if that confounded woman hasn't 'regulated' it to somewhere else! You may bring it to me. It is heavy, but not too heavy for you to carry, I think."

"Oh, I'm awfully strong," declared Pollyanna, cheerfully, as she sprang to her feet. In a minute she had returned with the box.

It was a wonderful half-hour that Pollyanna spent then. The box was full of treasures—curios that John Pendleton had picked up in years of travel—and concerning each there was some entertaining story, whether it were a set of exquisitely carved chessmen from China, or a little jade idol from India.

It was after she had heard the story about the idol that Pollyanna murmured wistfully:

"Well, I suppose it would be better to take a little boy in India to bring up—one that didn't know any more than to think that God was in that doll-thing—than it would be to take Jimmy Bean, a little boy who knows God is up in the sky. Still, I can't help wishing they had wanted Jimmy Bean, too, besides the India boys."

John Pendleton did not seem to hear. Again his eyes were staring straight before him, looking at nothing. But soon he had roused himself, and had picked up another curio to talk about.

The visit, certainly, was a delightful one, but before it was over, Pollyanna was realizing that they were talking about something besides the wonderful things in the beautiful carved box. They were talking of herself, of Nancy, of Aunt Polly, and of her daily life. They were talking, too, even of the life and home long ago in the far Western town.

Not until it was nearly time for her to go, did the man say, in a voice Pollyanna had never before heard from stern John Pendleton:

"Little girl, I want you to come to see me often. Will you? I'm lonesome, and I need you. There's another reason—and I'm going to tell you that, too. I thought, at first, after I found out who you were, the other day, that I didn't want you to come any more. You reminded me of—of something I have tried for long years to forget. So I said to myself that I never wanted to see you again; and every day, when the doctor asked if I wouldn't let him bring you to me, I said no.

"But after a time I found I was wanting to see you so much that—that the fact that I wasn't seeing you was making me remember all the more vividly the thing I was so wanting to forget. So now I want you to come. Will you—little girl?"

"Why, yes, Mr. Pendleton," breathed Pollyanna, her eyes luminous with sympathy for the sad-faced man lying back on the pillow before her. "I'd love to come!"

"Thank you," said John Pendleton, gently.





After supper that evening, Pollyanna, sitting on the back porch, told Nancy all about Mr. John Pendleton's wonderful carved box, and the still more wonderful things it contained.

"And ter think," sighed Nancy, "that he showed ye all them things, and told ye about 'em like that—him that's so cross he never talks ter no one—no one!"

"Oh, but he isn't cross, Nancy, only outside," demurred Pollyanna, with quick loyalty. "I don't see why everybody thinks he's so bad, either. They wouldn't, if they knew him. But even Aunt Polly doesn't like him very well. She wouldn't send the jelly to him, you know, and she was so afraid he'd think she did send it!"

"Probably she didn't call him no duty," shrugged Nancy. "But what beats me is how he happened ter take ter you so, Miss Pollyanna—meanin' no offence ter you, of course—but he ain't the sort o' man what gen'rally takes ter kids; he ain't, he ain't."

Pollyanna smiled happily.

"But he did, Nancy," she nodded, "only I reckon even he didn't want to—all the time. Why, only to-day he owned up that one time he just felt he never wanted to see me again, because I reminded him of something he wanted to forget. But afterwards—"

"What's that?" interrupted Nancy, excitedly. "He said you reminded him of something he wanted to forget?"

"Yes. But afterwards—"

"What was it?" Nancy was eagerly insistent.

"He didn't tell me. He just said it was something."

"The mystery!" breathed Nancy, in an awestruck voice. "That's why he took to you in the first place. Oh, Miss Pollyanna! Why, that's just like a book—I've read lots of 'em; 'Lady Maud's Secret', and 'The Lost Heir', and 'Hidden for Years'—all of 'em had mysteries and things just like this. My stars and stockings! Just think of havin' a book lived right under yer nose like this an' me not knowin' it all this time! Now tell me everythin'—everythin' he said, Miss Pollyanna, there's a dear!No wonder he took ter you; no wonder—no wonder!"

"But he didn't," cried Pollyanna, "not till I talked to him, first. And he didn't even know who I was till I took the calf's-foot jelly, and had to make him understand that Aunt Polly didn't send it, and—"

Nancy sprang to her feet and clasped her hands together suddenly.

"Oh, Miss Pollyanna, I know, I know—I know I know!" she exulted rapturously. The next minute she was down at Pollyanna's side again. "Tell me—now think, and answer straight and true," she urged excitedly, "It was after he found out you was Miss Polly's niece that he said he didn't ever want ter see ye again, wa'n't it?"

"Oh, yes. I told him that the last time I saw him, and he told me this to-day."

"I thought as much," triumphed Nancy. "And Miss Polly wouldn't send the jelly herself, would she?"

"No."

"And you told him she didn't send it?"

"Why, yes, I—"

"And he began ter act queer and cry out sudden after he found out you was her niece. He did that, didn't he?"

"Why, y-yes; he did act a little queer—over that jelly," admitted Pollyanna, with a thoughtful frown.

Nancy drew a long sigh.

"Then I've got it, sure! Now listen. Mr. John Pendleton was Miss Polly Harrington's Lover!" she announced impressively, but with a furtive glance over her shoulder.

"Why, Nancy, he couldn't be! She doesn't like him," objected Pollyanna.

Nancy gave her a scornful glance.

"Of course she don't! That's the quarrel!"

Pollyanna still looked incredulous, and with another long breath Nancy happily settled herself to tell the story.

"It's like this. Just before you come, Mr. Tom told me Miss Polly had had a lover once. I didn't believe it. I couldn't—her and a lover!But Mr. Tom said she had, and that he was livin' now right in this town.And now I know, of course. It's John Pendleton. Hain't he got a mystery in his life? Don't he shut himself up in that grand house alone, and never speak ter no one? Didn't he act queer when he found out you was Miss Polly's niece? And now hain't he owned up that you remind him of somethin' he wants ter forget? Just as if anybody couldn't see 'twas Miss Polly!—an' her sayin' she wouldn't send him no jelly, too. Why, Miss Pollyanna, it's as plain as the nose on yer face; it is, it is!"

"Oh-h!" breathed Pollyanna, in wide-eyed amazement. "But, Nancy, I should think if they loved each other they'd make up some time. Both of 'em all alone, so, all these years. I should think they'd be glad to make up!"

Nancy sniffed disdainfully.

"I guess maybe you don't know much about lovers, Miss Pollyanna. You ain't big enough yet, anyhow. But if there is a set o'folks in the world that wouldn't have no use for that 'ere 'glad game' o'your'n, it'd be a pair o' quarrellin' lovers; and that's what they be. Ain't he cross as sticks, most gen'rally?—and ain't she—"

Nancy stopped abruptly, remembering just in time to whom, and about whom, she was speaking. Suddenly, however, she chuckled.

"I ain't sayin', though, Miss Pollyanna, but what it would be a pretty slick piece of business if you could get 'em ter playin' it—so they would be glad ter make up. But, my land! wouldn't folks stare some—Miss Polly and him! I guess, though, there ain't much chance, much chance!"

Pollyanna said nothing; but when she went into the house a little later, her face was very thoughtful.





Chapter XVIII. Prisms


As the warm August days passed, Pollyanna went very frequently to the great house on Pendleton Hill. She did not feel, however, that her visits were really a success. Not but that the man seemed to want her there—he sent for her, indeed, frequently; but that when she was there, he seemed scarcely any the happier for her presence—at least, so Pollyanna thought.

He talked to her, it was true, and he showed her many strange and beautiful things—books, pictures, and curios. But he still fretted audibly over his own helplessness, and he chafed visibly under the rules and "regulatings" of the unwelcome members of his household.He did, indeed, seem to like to hear Pollyanna talk, however, and Pollyanna talked, Pollyanna liked to talk—but she was never sure that she would not look up and find him lying back on his pillow with that white, hurt look that always pained her; and she was never sure which—if any—of her words had brought it there. As for telling him the "glad game", and trying to get him to play it—Pollyanna had never seen the time yet when she thought he would care to hear about it. She had twice tried to tell him; but neither time had she got beyond the beginning of what her father had said—John Pendleton had on each occasion turned the conversation abruptly to another subject.

Pollyanna never doubted now that John Pendleton was her Aunt Polly's one-time lover; and with all the strength of her loving, loyal heart, she wished she could in some way bring happiness into their to her mind—miserably lonely lives.

Just how she was to do this, however, she could not see. She talked to Mr. Pendleton about her aunt; and he listened, sometimes politely, sometimes irritably, frequently with a quizzical smile on his usually stern lips. She talked to her aunt about Mr. Pendleton—or rather, she tried to talk to her about him. As a general thing, however, Miss Polly would not listen—long. She always found something else to talk about. She frequently did that, however, when Pollyanna was talking of others—of Dr. Chilton, for instance. Pollyanna laid this, though, to the fact that it had been Dr. Chilton who had seen her in the sun-parlor with the rose in her hair and the lace shawl draped about her shoulders.Aunt Polly, indeed, seemed particularly bitter against Dr. Chilton, as Pollyanna found out one day when a hard cold shut her up in the house.

"If you are not better by night I shall send for the doctor," Aunt Polly said.

"Shall you? Then I'm going to be worse," gurgled Pollyanna. "I'd love to have Dr. Chilton come to see me!"

She wondered, then, at the look that came to her aunt's face.

"It will not be Dr. Chilton, Pollyanna," Miss Polly said sternly. "Dr.Chilton is not our family physician. I shall send for Dr. Warren—if you are worse."

Pollyanna did not grow worse, however, and Dr. Warren was not summoned.

"And I'm so glad, too," Pollyanna said to her aunt that evening. "Of course I like Dr. Warren, and all that; but I like Dr. Chilton better, and I'm afraid he'd feel hurt if I didn't have him. You see, he wasn't really to blame, after all, that he happened to see you when I'd dressed you up so pretty that day, Aunt Polly," she finished wistfully.

"That will do, Pollyanna. I really do not wish to discuss Dr.Chilton—or his feelings," reproved Miss Polly, decisively.

Pollyanna looked at her for a moment with mournfully interested eyes; then she sighed:

"I just love to see you when your cheeks are pink like that, Aunt Polly; but I would so like to fix your hair. If—Why, Aunt Polly!" But her aunt was already out of sight down the hall.





It was toward the end of August that Pollyanna, making an early morning call on John Pendleton, found the flaming band of blue and gold and green edged with red and violet lying across his pillow. She stopped short in awed delight.

"Why, Mr. Pendleton, it's a baby rainbow—a real rainbow come in to pay you a visit!" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together softly. "Oh—oh—oh, how pretty it is! But how did it get in?" she cried.

The man laughed a little grimly: John Pendleton was particularly out of sorts with the world this morning.

"Well, I suppose it 'got in' through the bevelled edge of that glass thermometer in the window," he said wearily. "The sun shouldn't strike it at all but it does in the morning."

"Oh, but it's so pretty, Mr. Pendleton! And does just the sun do that? My! if it was mine I'd have it hang in the sun all day long!"

"Lots of good you'd get out of the thermometer, then," laughed the man. "How do you suppose you could tell how hot it was, or how cold it was, if the thermometer hung in the sun all day?"

"I shouldn't care," breathed Pollyanna, her fascinated eyes on the brilliant band of colors across the pillow. "Just as if anybody'd care when they were living all the time in a rainbow!"

The man laughed. He was watching Pollyanna's rapt face a little curiously. Suddenly a new thought came to him. He touched the bell at his side.

"Nora," he said, when the elderly maid appeared at the door, "bring me one of the big brass candle-sticks from the mantel in the front drawing-room."

"Yes, sir," murmured the woman, looking slightly dazed. In a minute she had returned. A musical tinkling entered the room with her as she advanced wonderingly toward the bed. It came from the prism pendants encircling the old-fashioned candelabrum in her hand.

"Thank you. You may set it here on the stand," directed the man. "Now get a string and fasten it to the sash-curtain fixtures of that window there. Take down the sash-curtain, and let the string reach straight across the window from side to side. That will be all. Thank you," he said, when she had carried out his directions.

As she left the room he turned smiling eyes toward the wondering Pollyanna.

"Bring me the candlestick now, please, Pollyanna."

With both hands she brought it; and in a moment he was slipping off the pendants, one by one, until they lay, a round dozen of them, side by side, on the bed.

"Now, my dear, suppose you take them and hook them to that little string Nora fixed across the window. If you really want to live in a rainbow—I don't see but we'll have to have a rainbow for you to live in!"

Pollyanna had not hung up three of the pendants in the sunlit window before she saw a little of what was going to happen. She was so excited then she could scarcely control her shaking fingers enough to hang up the rest. But at last her task was finished, and she stepped back with a low cry of delight.

It had become a fairyland—that sumptuous, but dreary bedroom.Everywhere were bits of dancing red and green, violet and orange, gold and blue. The wall, the floor, and the furniture, even to the bed itself, were aflame with shimmering bits of color.

"Oh, oh, oh, how lovely!" breathed Pollyanna; then she laughed suddenly. "I just reckon the sun himself is trying to play the game now, don't you?" she cried, forgetting for the moment that Mr. Pendleton could not know what she was talking about. "Oh, how I wish I had a lot of those things! How I would like to give them to Aunt Polly and Mrs.Snow and—lots of folks. I reckon then they'd be glad all right! Why, I think even Aunt Polly'd get so glad she couldn't help banging doors if she lived in a rainbow like that. Don't you?"

Mr. Pendleton laughed.

"Well, from my remembrance of your aunt, Miss Pollyanna, I must say I think it would take something more than a few prisms in the sunlight to—to make her bang many doors—for gladness. But come, now, really, what do you mean?"

Pollyanna stared slightly; then she drew a long breath.

"Oh, I forgot. You don't know about the game. I remember now."

"Suppose you tell me, then."

And this time Pollyanna told him. She told him the whole thing from the very first—from the crutches that should have been a doll. As she talked, she did not look at his face. Her rapt eyes were still on the dancing flecks of color from the prism pendants swaying in the sunlit window.

"And that's all," she sighed, when she had finished. "And now you know why I said the sun was trying to play it—that game."

For a moment there was silence. Then a low voice from the bed said unsteadily:

"Perhaps, but I'm thinking that the very finest prism of them all is yourself, Pollyanna."

"Oh, but I don't show beautiful red and green and purple when the sun shines through me, Mr. Pendleton!"

"Don't you?" smiled the man. And Pollyanna, looking into his face, wondered why there were tears in his eyes.

"No," she said. Then, after a minute she added mournfully: "I'm afraid, Mr. Pendleton, the sun doesn't make anything but freckles out of me. Aunt Polly says it does make them!"

The man laughed a little; and again Pollyanna looked at him; the laugh had sounded almost like a sob.





Chapter XIX. Which is Somewhat Surprising


Pollyanna entered school in September. Preliminary examinations showed that she was well advanced for a girl of her years, and she was soon a happy member of a class of girls and boys her own age.

School, in some ways, was a surprise to Pollyanna; and Pollyanna, certainly, in many ways, was very much of a surprise to school. They were soon on the best of terms, however, and to her aunt Pollyanna confessed that going to school was living, after all—though she had had her doubts before.

In spite of her delight in her new work, Pollyanna did not forget her old friends. True, she could not give them quite so much time now, of course; but she gave them what time she could. Perhaps John Pendleton, of them all, however, was the most dissatisfied.

One Saturday afternoon he spoke to her about it.

"See here, Pollyanna, how would you like to come and live with me?" he asked, a little impatiently. "I don't see anything of you, nowadays."

Pollyanna laughed—Mr. Pendleton was such a funny man!

"I thought you didn't like to have folks 'round," she said.

He made a wry face.

"Oh, but that was before you taught me to play that wonderful game of yours. Now I'm glad to be waited on, hand and foot! Never mind, I'll be on my own two feet yet, one of these days; then I'll see who steps around," he finished, picking up one of the crutches at his side and shaking it playfully at the little girl. They were sitting in the great library to-day.

"Oh, but you aren't really glad at all for things; you just say you are," pouted Pollyanna, her eyes on the dog, dozing before the fire. "You know you don't play the game right ever, Mr. Pendleton—you know you don't!"

The man's face grew suddenly very grave.

"That's why I want you, little girl—to help me play it. Will you come?"

Pollyanna turned in surprise.

"Mr. Pendleton, you don't really mean—that?"

"But I do. I want you. Will you come?"

Pollyanna looked distressed.

"Why, Mr. Pendleton, I can't—you know I can't. Why, I'm—Aunt Polly's!"

A quick something crossed the man's face that Pollyanna could not quite understand. His head came up almost fiercely.

"You're no more hers than—Perhaps she would let you come to me," he finished more gently. "Would you come—if she did?"

Pollyanna frowned in deep thought.

"But Aunt Polly has been so—good to me," she began slowly; "and she took me when I didn't have anybody left but the Ladies' Aid, and—"

Again that spasm of something crossed the man's face; but this time, when he spoke, his voice was low and very sad.

"Pollyanna, long years ago I loved somebody very much. I hoped to bring her, some day, to this house. I pictured how happy we'd be together in our home all the long years to come."

"Yes," pitied Pollyanna, her eyes shining with sympathy.

"But—well, I didn't bring her here. Never mind why. I just didn't that's all. And ever since then this great gray pile of stone has been a house—never a home. It takes a woman's hand and heart, or a child's presence, to make a home, Pollyanna; and I have not had either. Now will you come, my dear?"

Pollyanna sprang to her feet. Her face was fairly illumined.

"Mr. Pendleton, you—you mean that you wish you—you had had that woman's hand and heart all this time?"

"Why, y-yes, Pollyanna."

"Oh, I'm so glad! Then it's all right," sighed the little girl. "Now you can take us both, and everything will be lovely."

"Take—you—both?" repeated the man, dazedly.

A faint doubt crossed Pollyanna's countenance.

"Well, of course, Aunt Polly isn't won over, yet; but I'm sure she will be if you tell it to her just as you did to me, and then we'd both come, of course."

A look of actual terror leaped to the man's eyes.

"Aunt Polly come—here!"

Pollyanna's eyes widened a little.

"Would you rather go there?" she asked. "Of course the house isn't quite so pretty, but it's nearer—"

"Pollyanna, what are you talking about?" asked the man, very gently now.

"Why, about where we're going to live, of course," rejoined Pollyanna, in obvious surprise. "I thought you meant here, at first. You said it was here that you had wanted Aunt Polly's hand and heart all these years to make a home, and—"

An inarticulate cry came from the man's throat. He raised his hand and began to speak; but the next moment he dropped his hand nervelessly at his side.

"The doctor, sir," said the maid in the doorway.

Pollyanna rose at once.

John Pendleton turned to her feverishly.

"Pollyanna, for Heaven's sake, say nothing of what I asked you—yet," he begged, in a low voice. Pollyanna dimpled into a sunny smile.

"Of course not! Just as if I didn't know you'd rather tell her yourself!" she called back merrily over her shoulder.

John Pendleton fell limply back in his chair.

"Why, what's up?" demanded the doctor, a minute later, his fingers on his patient's galloping pulse.

A whimsical smile trembled on John Pendleton's lips.

"Overdose of your—tonic, I guess," he laughed, as he noted the doctor's eyes following Pollyanna's little figure down the driveway.





Chapter XX. Which is More Surprising


Sunday mornings Pollyanna usually attended church and Sunday school. Sunday afternoons she frequently went for a walk with Nancy.She had planned one for the day after her Saturday afternoon visit to Mr. John Pendleton; but on the way home from Sunday school Dr.Chilton overtook her in his gig, and brought his horse to a stop.

"Suppose you let me drive you home, Pollyanna," he suggested. "I want to speak to you a minute. I was just driving out to your place to tell you," he went on, as Pollyanna settled herself at his side. "Mr.Pendleton sent a special request for you to go to see him this afternoon, sure. He says it's very important."

Pollyanna nodded happily.

"Yes, it is, I know. I'll go."

The doctor eyed her with some surprise.

"I'm not sure I shall let you, after all," he declared, his eyes twinkling. "You seemed more upsetting than soothing yesterday, young lady."

Pollyanna laughed.

"Oh, it wasn't me, truly—not really, you know; not so much as it was Aunt Polly."

The doctor turned with a quick start.

"Your—aunt!" he ejaculated.

Pollyanna gave a happy little bounce in her seat.

"Yes. And it's so exciting and lovely, just like a story, you know.I—I'm going to tell you," she burst out, with sudden decision. "He said not to mention it; but he wouldn't mind your knowing, of course. He meant not to mention it to HER."

"Her?"

"Yes; Aunt Polly. And, of course he would want to tell her himself instead of having me do it—lovers, so!"

"Lovers!" As the doctor said the word, the horse started violently, as if the hand that held the reins had given them a sharp jerk.

"Yes," nodded Pollyanna, happily. "That's the story-part, you see. I didn't know it till Nancy told me. She said Aunt Polly had a lover years ago, and they quarrelled. She didn't know who it was at first. But we've found out now. It's Mr. Pendleton, you know."

The doctor relaxed suddenly, The hand holding the reins fell limply to his lap.

"Oh! No; I—didn't know," he said quietly.

Pollyanna hurried on—they were nearing the Harrington homestead.

"Yes; and I'm so glad now. It's come out lovely. Mr. Pendleton asked me to come and live with him, but of course I wouldn't leave Aunt Polly like that—after she'd been so good to me. Then he told me all about the woman's hand and heart that he used to want, and I found out that he wanted it now; and I was so glad! For of course if he wants to make up the quarrel, everything will be all right now, and Aunt Polly and I will both go to live there, or else he'll come to live with us. Of course Aunt Polly doesn't know yet, and we haven't got everything settled; so I suppose that is why he wanted to see me this afternoon, sure."

The doctor sat suddenly erect. There was an odd smile on his lips.

"Yes, I can well imagine that Mr. John Pendleton does—want to see you, Pollyanna," he nodded, as he pulled his horse to a stop before the door.

"There's Aunt Polly now in the window," cried Pollyanna; then, a second later: "Why, no, she isn't—but I thought I saw her!"

"No; she isn't there—now," said the doctor, His lips had suddenly lost their smile.

Pollyanna found a very nervous John Pendleton waiting for her that afternoon.

"Pollyanna," he began at once. "I've been trying all night to puzzle out what you meant by all that, yesterday—about my wanting your Aunt Polly's hand and heart here all those years. What did you mean?"

"Why, because you were lovers, you know once; and I was so glad you still felt that way now."

"Lovers!—your Aunt Polly and I?"

At the obvious surprise in the man's voice, Pollyanna opened wide her eyes.

"Why, Mr. Pendleton, Nancy said you were!"

The man gave a short little laugh.

"Indeed! Well, I'm afraid I shall have to say that Nancy—didn't know."

"Then you—weren't lovers?" Pollyanna's voice was tragic with dismay.

"Never!"

"And it isn't all coming out like a book?"

There was no answer. The man's eyes were moodily fixed out the window.

"O dear! And it was all going so splendidly," almost sobbed Pollyanna. "I'd have been so glad to come—with Aunt Polly."

"And you won't—now?" The man asked the question without turning his head.

"Of course not! I'm Aunt Polly's."

The man turned now, almost fiercely.

"Before you were hers, Pollyanna, you were—your mother's.And—it was your mother's hand and heart that I wanted long years ago."

"My mother's!"

"Yes. I had not meant to tell you, but perhaps it's better, after all, that I do—now." John Pendleton's face had grown very white. He was speaking with evident difficulty. Pollyanna, her eyes wide and frightened, and her lips parted, was gazing at him fixedly. "I loved your mother; but she—didn't love me. And after a time she went away with—your father. I did not know until then how much I did—care. The whole world suddenly seemed to turn black under my fingers, and—But, never mind. For long years I have been a cross, crabbed, unlovable, unloved old man—though I'm not nearly sixty, yet, Pollyanna. Then, one day, like one of the prisms that you love so well, little girl, you danced into my life, and flecked my dreary old world with dashes of the purple and gold and scarlet of your own bright cheeriness. I found out, after a time, who you were, and—and I thought then I never wanted to see you again. I didn't want to be reminded of—your mother. But—you know how that came out. I just had to have you come. And now I want you always. Pollyanna, won't you come now?"

"But, Mr. Pendleton, I—There's Aunt Polly!" Pollyanna's eyes were blurred with tears.

The man made an impatient gesture.

"What about me? How do you suppose I'm going to be 'glad' about anything—without you? Why, Pollyanna, it's only since you came that I've been even half glad to live! But if I had you for my own little girl, I'd be glad for—anything; and I'd try to make you glad, too, my dear. You shouldn't have a wish ungratified. All my money, to the last cent, should go to make you happy."

Pollyanna looked shocked.

"Why, Mr. Pendleton, as if I'd let you spend it on me—all that money you've saved for the heathen!"

A dull red came to the man's face. He started to speak, but Pollyanna was still talking.

"Besides, anybody with such a lot of money as you have doesn't need me to make you glad about things. You're making other folks so glad giving them things that you just can't help being glad yourself!Why, look at those prisms you gave Mrs. Snow and me, and the gold piece you gave Nancy on her birthday, and—"

"Yes, yes—never mind about all that," interrupted the man. His face was very, very red now—and no wonder, perhaps: it was not for"giving things" that John Pendleton had been best known in the past. "That's all nonsense. 'Twasn't much, anyhow—but what there was, was because of you. you gave those things; not I! Yes, you did," he repeated, in answer to the shocked denial in her face. "And that only goes to prove all the more how I need you, little girl," he added, his voice softening into tender pleading once more. "If ever, ever I am to play the' glad game,' Pollyanna, you'll have to come and play it with me."

The little girl's forehead puckered into a wistful frown.

"Aunt Polly has been so good to me," she began; but the man interrupted her sharply. The old irritability had come back to his face.Impatience which would brook no opposition had been a part of John Pendleton's nature too long to yield very easily now to restraint.

"Of course she's been good to you! But she doesn't want you, I'll warrant, half so much as I do," he contested.

"Why, Mr. Pendleton, she's glad, I know, to have—"

"Glad!" interrupted the man, thoroughly losing his patience now. "I'll wager Miss Polly doesn't know how to be glad—for anything!Oh, she does her duty, I know. She's a very dutiful woman. I've had experience with her 'duty,' before. I'll acknowledge we haven't been the best of friends for the last fifteen or twenty years. But I know her. Every one knows her—and she isn't the 'glad' kind, Pollyanna. She doesn't know how to be. As for your coming to me—you just ask her and see if she won't let you come. And, oh, little girl, little girl, I want you so!" he finished brokenly.

Pollyanna rose to her feet with a long sigh.

"All right. I'll ask her," she said wistfully. "Of course I don't mean that I wouldn't like to live here with you, Mr. Pendleton, but—" She did not complete her sentence. There was a moment's silence, then she added: "Well, anyhow, I'm glad I didn't tell her yesterday;—'cause then I supposed she was wanted, too."

John Pendleton smiled grimly.

"Well, yes, Pollyanna; I guess it is just as well you didn't mention it—yesterday."

"I didn't—only to the doctor; and of course he doesn't count."

"The doctor!" cried John Pendleton, turning quickly. "Not—Dr.—Chilton?"

"Yes; when he came to tell me you wanted to see me to-day, you know."

"Well, of all the—" muttered the man, falling back in his chair.Then he sat up with sudden interest. "And what did Dr. Chilton say?" he asked.

Pollyanna frowned thoughtfully.

"Why, I don't remember. Not much, I reckon. Oh, he did say he could well imagine you did want to see me."

"Oh, did he, indeed!" answered John Pendleton. And Pollyanna wondered why he gave that sudden queer little laugh.





Chapter XXI. A Question Answered


The sky was darkening fast with what appeared to be an approaching thunder shower when Pollyanna hurried down the hill from John Pendleton's house. Half-way home she met Nancy with an umbrella. By that time, however, the clouds had shifted their position and the shower was not so imminent.

"Guess it's goin' 'round ter the north," announced Nancy, eyeing the sky critically. "I thought 'twas, all the time, but Miss Polly wanted me ter come with this. She was worried about ye!"

"Was she?" murmured Pollyanna abstractedly, eyeing the clouds in her turn.

Nancy sniffed a little.

"You don't seem ter notice what I said," she observed aggrievedly. "I said yer aunt was worried about ye!"

"Oh," sighed Pollyanna, remembering suddenly the question she was so soon to ask her aunt. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare her."

"Well, I'm glad," retorted Nancy, unexpectedly. "I am, I am."

Pollyanna stared.

"Glad that Aunt Polly was scared about me! Why, Nancy, that isn't the way to play the game—to be glad for things like that!" she objected.

"There wa'n't no game in it," retorted Nancy. "Never thought of it. you don't seem ter sense what it means ter have Miss Polly worried about ye, child!"

"Why, it means worried—and worried is horrid—to feel," maintained Pollyanna. "What else can it mean?"

Nancy tossed her head.

"Well, I'll tell ye what it means. It means she's at last gettin' down somewheres near human—like folks; an' that she ain't jest doin' her duty by ye all the time."

"Why, Nancy," demurred the scandalized Pollyanna, "Aunt Polly always does her duty. She—she's a very dutiful woman!" Unconsciously Pollyanna repeated John Pendleton's words of half an hour before.

Nancy chuckled.

"You're right she is—and she always was, I guess! But she's somethin' more, now, since you came."

Pollyanna's face changed. Her brows drew into a troubled frown.

"There, that's what I was going to ask you, Nancy," she sighed. "Do you think Aunt Polly likes to have me here? Would she mind—if—if I wasn't here any more?"

Nancy threw a quick look into the little girl's absorbed face. She had expected to be asked this question long before, and she had dreaded it. She had wondered how she should answer it—how she could answer it honestly without cruelly hurting the questioner. But now, now, in the face of the new suspicions that had become convictions by the afternoon's umbrella-sending—Nancy only welcomed the question with open arms. She was sure that, with a clean conscience to-day, she could set the love-hungry little girl's heart at rest.

"Likes ter have ye here? Would she miss ye if ye wa'n't here?" cried Nancy, indignantly. "As if that wa'n't jest what I was tellin' of ye!Didn't she send me posthaste with an umbrella 'cause she see a little cloud in the sky? Didn't she make me tote yer things all down-stairs, so you could have the pretty room you wanted? Why, Miss Pollyanna, when ye remember how at first she hated ter have—"

With a choking cough Nancy pulled herself up just in time.

"And it ain't jest things I can put my fingers on, neither," rushed on Nancy, breathlessly. "It's little ways she has, that shows how you've been softenin' her up an' mellerin' her down—the cat, and the dog, and the way she speaks ter me, and oh, lots o' things. Why, Miss Pollyanna, there ain't no tellin' how she'd miss ye—if ye wa'n't here," finished Nancy, speaking with an enthusiastic certainty that was meant to hide the perilous admission she had almost made before. Even then she was not quite prepared for the sudden joy that illumined Pollyanna's face.

"Oh, Nancy, I'm so glad—glad—glad! You don't know how glad I am that Aunt Polly—wants me!"

"As if I'd leave her now!" thought Pollyanna, as she climbed the stairs to her room a little later. "I always knew I wanted to live with Aunt Polly—but I reckon maybe I didn't know quite how much I wanted Aunt Polly—to want to live with me!"

The task of telling John Pendleton of her decision would not be an easy one, Pollyanna knew, and she dreaded it. She was very fond of John Pendleton, and she was very sorry for him—because he seemed to be so sorry for himself. She was sorry, too, for the long, lonely life that had made him so unhappy; and she was grieved that it had been because of her mother that he had spent those dreary years. She pictured the great gray house as it would be after its master was well again, with its silent rooms, its littered floors, its disordered desk; and her heart ached for his loneliness. She wished that somewhere, some one might be found who—And it was at this point that she sprang to her feet with a little cry of joy at the thought that had come to her.

As soon as she could, after that, she hurried up the hill to John Pendleton's house; and in due time she found herself in the great dim library, with John Pendleton himself sitting near her, his long, thin hands lying idle on the arms of his chair, and his faithful little dog at his feet.

"Well, Pollyanna, is it to be the 'glad game' with me, all the rest of my life?" asked the man, gently.

"Oh, yes," cried Pollyanna. "I've thought of the very gladdest kind of a thing for you to do, and—"

"With—you?" asked John Pendleton, his mouth growing a little stern at the corners.

"N-no; but—"

"Pollyanna, you aren't going to say no!" interrupted a voice deep with emotion.

"I—I've got to, Mr. Pendleton; truly I have. Aunt Polly—"

"Did she refuse—to let you—come?"

"I—I didn't ask her," stammered the little girl, miserably.

"Pollyanna!"

Pollyanna turned away her eyes. She could not meet the hurt, grieved gaze of her friend.

"So you didn't even ask her!"

"I couldn't, sir—truly," faltered Pollyanna. "You see, I found out—without asking. Aunt Polly wants me with her, and—and I want to stay, too," she confessed bravely. "You don't know how good she's been to me; and—and I think, really, sometimes she's beginning to be glad about things—lots of things. And you know she never used to be. You said it yourself. Oh, Mr. Pendleton, I couldn't leave Aunt Polly—now!"

There was a long pause. Only the snapping of the wood fire in the grate broke the silence. At last, however, the man spoke.

"No, Pollyanna; I see. You couldn't leave her—now," he said. "I won't ask you—again." The last word was so low it was almost inaudible; but Pollyanna heard.

"Oh, but you don't know about the rest of it," she reminded him eagerly. "There's the very gladdest thing you can do—truly there is!"

"Not for me, Pollyanna."

"Yes, sir, for you. You said it. You said only a—a woman's hand and heart or a child's presence could make a home. And I can get it for you—a child's presence;—not me, you know, but another one."

"As if I would have any but you!" resented an indignant voice.

"But you will—when you know; you're so kind and good! Why, think of the prisms and the gold pieces, and all that money you save for the heathen, and—"

"Pollyanna!" interrupted the man, savagely. "Once for all let us end that nonsense! I've tried to tell you half a dozen times before. There is no money for the heathen. I never sent a penny to them in my life.There!"

He lifted his chin and braced himself to meet what he expected—the grieved disappointment of Pollyanna's eyes. To his amazement, however, there was neither grief nor disappointment in Pollyanna's eyes. There was only surprised joy.

"Oh, oh!" she cried, clapping her hands. "I'm so glad! That is," she corrected, coloring distressfully, "I don't mean that I'm not sorry for the heathen, only just now I can't help being glad that you don't want the little India boys, because all the rest have wanted them. And so I'm glad you'd rather have Jimmy Bean. Now I know you'll take him!"

"Take—who?"

"Jimmy Bean. He's the 'child's presence', you know; and he'll be so glad to be it. I had to tell him last week that even my Ladies' Aid out West wouldn't take him, and he was so disappointed. But now—when he hears of this—he'll be so glad!"

"Will he? Well, I won't," ejaculated the man, decisively. "Pollyanna, this is sheer nonsense!"

"You don't mean—you won't take him?"

"I certainly do mean just that."

"But he'd be a lovely child's presence," faltered Pollyanna. She was almost crying now. "And you couldn't be lonesome—with Jimmy'round."

"I don't doubt it," rejoined the man; "but—I think I prefer the lonesomeness."

It was then that Pollyanna, for the first time in weeks, suddenly remembered something Nancy had once told her. She raised her chin aggrievedly.

"Maybe you think a nice live little boy wouldn't be better than that old dead skeleton you keep somewhere; but I think it would!"

"Skeleton?"

"Yes. Nancy said you had one in your closet, somewhere."

"Why, what—" Suddenly the man threw back his head and laughed. He laughed very heartily indeed—so heartily that Pollyanna began to cry from pure nervousness. When he saw that, John Pendleton sat erect very promptly. His face grew grave at once.

"Pollyanna, I suspect you are right—more right than you know," he said gently. "In fact, I know that a 'nice live little boy' would be far better than—my skeleton in the closet; only—we aren't always willing to make the exchange. We are apt to still cling to—our skeletons, Pollyanna. However, suppose you tell me a little more about this nice little boy." And Pollyanna told him.

Perhaps the laugh cleared the air; or perhaps the pathos of Jimmy Bean's story as told by Pollyanna's eager little lips touched a heart already strangely softened. At all events, when Pollyanna went home that night she carried with her an invitation for Jimmy Bean himself to call at the great house with Pollyanna the next Saturday afternoon.

"And I'm so glad, and I'm sure you'll like him," sighed Pollyanna, as she said good-by. "I do so want Jimmy Bean to have a home—and folks that care, you know."

On the afternoon that Pollyanna told John Pendleton of Jimmy Bean, the Rev. Paul Ford climbed the hill and entered the Pendleton Woods, hoping that the hushed beauty of God's out-of-doors would still the tumult that His children of men had wrought.

The Rev. Paul Ford was sick at heart. Month by month, for a year past, conditions in the parish under him had been growing worse and worse; until it seemed that now, turn which way he would, he encountered only wrangling, backbiting, scandal, and jealousy. He had argued, pleaded, rebuked, and ignored by turns; and always and through all he had prayed—earnestly, hopefully. But to-day miserably he was forced to own that matters were no better, but rather worse.

Two of his deacons were at swords' points over a silly something that only endless brooding had made of any account. Three of his most energetic women workers had withdrawn from the Ladies' Aid Society because a tiny spark of gossip had been fanned by wagging tongues into a devouring flame of scandal. The choir had split over the amount of solo work given to a fanciedly preferred singer. Even the Christian Endeavor Society was in a ferment of unrest owing to open criticism of two of its officers. As to the Sunday School—it had been the resignation of its superintendent and two of its teachers that had been the last straw, and that had sent the harassed minister to the quiet woods for prayer and meditation.

Under the green arch of the trees the Rev. Paul Ford faced the thing squarely. To his mind, the crisis had come. Something must be done—and done at once. The entire work of the church was at a standstill. The Sunday services, the week-day prayer meeting, the missionary teas, even the suppers and socials were becoming less and less well attended.True, a few conscientious workers were still left. But they pulled at cross purposes, usually; and always they showed themselves to be acutely aware of the critical eyes all about them, and of the tongues that had nothing to do but to talk about what the eyes saw.

And because of all this, the Rev. Paul Ford understood very well that he (God's minister), the church, the town, and even Christianity itself was suffering; and must suffer still more unless...

Clearly something must be done, and done at once. But what?

Slowly the minister took from his pocket the notes he had made for his next Sunday's sermon. Frowningly he looked at them. His mouth settled into stern lines, as aloud, very impressively, he read the verses on which he had determined to speak:

"'But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.'

"'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.'

"'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.'"

It was a bitter denunciation. In the green aisles of the woods, the minister's deep voice rang out with scathing effect. Even the birds and squirrels seemed hushed into awed silence. It brought to the minister a vivid realization of how those words would sound the next Sunday when he should utter them before his people in the sacred hush of the church.

His people!—they were his people. Could he do it? Dare he do it? Dare he not do it? It was a fearful denunciation, even without the words that would follow—his own words. He had prayed and prayed. He had pleaded earnestly for help, for guidance. He longed—oh, how earnestly he longed!—to take now, in this crisis, the right step. But was this—the right step?

Slowly the minister folded the papers and thrust them back into his pocket. Then, with a sigh that was almost a moan, he flung himself down at the foot of a tree, and covered his face with his hands.

It was there that Pollyanna, on her way home from the Pendleton house, found him. With a little cry she ran forward.

"Oh, oh, Mr. Ford! You—you haven't broken your leg or—or anything, have you?" she gasped.

The minister dropped his hands, and looked up quickly. He tried to smile.

"No, dear—no, indeed! I'm just—resting."

"Oh," sighed Pollyanna, falling back a little. "That's all right, then.You see, Mr. Pendleton had broken his leg when I found him—but he was lying down, though. And you are sitting up."

"Yes, I am sitting up; and I haven't broken anything—that doctors can mend."

The last words were very low, but Pollyanna heard them. A swift change crossed her face. Her eyes glowed with tender sympathy.

"I know what you mean—something plagues you. Father used to feel like that, lots of times. I reckon ministers do—most generally. You see, there's such a lot depends on 'em, somehow."

The Rev. Paul Ford turned a little wonderingly.

"Was your father a minister, Pollyanna?"

"Yes, sir. Didn't you know? I supposed everybody knew that. He married Aunt Polly's sister, and she was my mother."

"Oh, I understand. But, you see, I haven't been here many years, so I don't know all the family histories."

"Yes, sir—I mean, no, sir," smiled Pollyanna.

There was a long pause. The minister, still sitting at the foot of the tree, appeared to have forgotten Pollyanna's presence. He had pulled some papers from his pocket and unfolded them; but he was not looking at them. He was gazing, instead, at a leaf on the ground a little distance away—and it was not even a pretty leaf. It was brown and dead.Pollyanna, looking at him, felt vaguely sorry for him.

"It—it's a nice day," she began hopefully.

For a moment there was no answer; then the minister looked up with a start.

"What? Oh!—yes, it is a very nice day."

"And 'tisn't cold at all, either, even if 'tis October," observed Pollyanna, still more hopefully. "Mr. Pendleton had a fire, but he said he didn't need it. It was just to look at. I like to look at fires, don't you?"

There was no reply this time, though Pollyanna waited patiently, before she tried again—by a new route.

"Do You like being a minister?"

The Rev. Paul Ford looked up now, very quickly.

"Do I like—Why, what an odd question! Why do you ask that, my dear?"

"Nothing—only the way you looked. It made me think of my father. He used to look like that—sometimes."

"Did he?" The minister's voice was polite, but his eyes had gone back to the dried leaf on the ground.

"Yes, and I used to ask him just as I did you if he was glad he was a minister."

The man under the tree smiled a little sadly.

"Well—what did he say?"

"Oh, he always said he was, of course, but 'most always he said, too, that he wouldn't stay a minister a minute if 'twasn't for the rejoicing texts."

"The—what?" The Rev. Paul Ford's eyes left the leaf and gazed wonderingly into Pollyanna's merry little face.

"Well, that's what father used to call 'em," she laughed. "Of course the Bible didn't name 'em that. But it's all those that begin 'Be glad in the Lord,' or 'Rejoice greatly,' or 'Shout for joy,' and all that, you know—such a lot of 'em. Once, when father felt specially bad, he counted 'em. There were eight hundred of 'em."

"Eight hundred!"

"Yes—that told you to rejoice and be glad, you know; that's why father named 'em the 'rejoicing texts'."

"Oh!" There was an odd look on the minister's face. His eyes had fallen to the words on the top paper in his hands— "But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!" "And so your father—liked those'rejoicing texts,' " he murmured.

"Oh, yes," nodded Pollyanna, emphatically. "He said he felt better right away, that first day he thought to count 'em. He said if God took the trouble to tell us eight hundred times to be glad and rejoice, He must want us to do it—some. And father felt ashamed that he hadn't done it more. After that, they got to be such a comfort to him, you know, when things went wrong; when the Ladies' Aiders got to fight—I mean, when they didn't agree about something," corrected Pollyanna, hastily. "Why, it was those texts, too, father said, that made him think of the game—he began with me on the crutches—but he said 'twas the rejoicing texts that started him on it."

"And what game might that be?" asked the minister.

"About finding something in everything to be glad about, you know. As I said, he began with me on the crutches." And once more Pollyanna told her story—this time to a man who listened with tender eyes and understanding ears.

A little later Pollyanna and the minister descended the hill, hand in hand. Pollyanna's face was radiant. Pollyanna loved to talk, and she had been talking now for some time: there seemed to be so many, many things about the game, her father, and the old home life that the minister wanted to know.

At the foot of the hill their ways parted, and Pollyanna down one road, and the minister down another, walked on alone.

In the Rev. Paul Ford's study that evening the minister sat thinking.Near him on the desk lay a few loose sheets of paper—his sermon notes.Under the suspended pencil in his fingers lay other sheets of paper, blank—his sermon to be. But the minister was not thinking either of what he had written, or of what he intended to write. In his imagination he was far away in a little Western town with a missionary minister who was poor, sick, worried, and almost alone in the world—but who was poring over the Bible to find how many times his Lord and Master had told him to "rejoice and be glad".

After a time, with a long sigh, the Rev. Paul Ford roused himself, came back from the far Western town, and adjusted the sheets of paper under his hand.

"Matthew twenty-third; 13—14 and 23," he wrote; then, with a gesture of impatience, he dropped his pencil and pulled toward him a magazine left on the desk by his wife a few minutes before. Listlessly his tired eyes turned from paragraph to paragraph until these words arrested them:





"A father one day said to his son, Tom, who, he knew, had refused to fill his mother's woodbox that morning: 'Tom, I'm sure you'll be glad to go and bring in some wood for your mother.' And without a word Tom went. Why? Just because his father showed so plainly that he expected him to do the right thing. Suppose he had said: 'Tom, I overheard what you said to your mother this morning, and I'm ashamed of you. Go at once and fill that woodbox!' I'll warrant that woodbox, would be empty yet, so far as Tom was concerned!"

On and on read the minister—a word here, a line there, a paragraph somewhere else:





"What men and women need is encouragement. Their natural resisting powers should be strengthened, not weakened... Instead of always harping on a man's faults, tell him of his virtues. Try to pull him out of his rut of bad habits. Hold up to him his better self, his real self that can dare and do and win out!... The influence of a beautiful, helpful, hopeful character is contagious, and may revolutionize a whole town... People radiate what is in their minds and in their hearts. If a man feels kindly and obliging, his neighbors will feel that way, too, before long. But if he scolds and scowls and criticizes—his neighbors will return scowl for scowl, and add interest!... When you look for the bad, expecting it, you will get it. When you know you will find the good—you will get that... Tell your son Tom you know he'll be glad to fill that woodbox—then watch him start, alert and interested!"

The minister dropped the paper and lifted his chin. In a moment he was on his feet, tramping the narrow room back and forth, back and forth. Later, some time later, he drew a long breath, and dropped himself in the chair at his desk.

"God helping me, I'll do it!" he cried softly. "I'll tell all my Toms I know they'll be glad to fill that woodbox! I'll give them work to do, and I'll make them so full of the very joy of doing it that they won't have time to look at their neighbors' woodboxes!" And he picked up his sermon notes, tore straight through the sheets, and cast them from him, so that on one side of his chair lay "But woe unto you," and on the other, "scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!" while across the smooth white paper before him his pencil fairly flew—after first drawing one black line through Matthew twenty-third; 13—14 and 23.

Thus it happened that the Rev. Paul Ford's sermon the next Sunday was a veritable bugle-call to the best that was in every man and woman and child that heard it; and its text was one of Pollyanna's shining eight hundred:

"Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, ye righteous, and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart."





Chapter XXIII. An Accident


At Mrs. Snow's request, Pollyanna went one day to Dr. Chilton's office to get the name of a medicine which Mrs. Snow had forgotten.As it chanced, Pollyanna had never before seen the inside of Dr.Chilton's office.

"I've never been to your home before! This is your home, isn't it?" she said, looking interestedly about her.

The doctor smiled a little sadly.

"Yes—such as 'tis," he answered, as he wrote something on the pad of paper in his hand; "but it's a pretty poor apology for a home, Pollyanna. They're just rooms, that's all—not a home."

Pollyanna nodded her head wisely. Her eyes glowed with sympathetic understanding.

"I know. It takes a woman's hand and heart, or a child's presence to make a home," she said.

"Eh?" The doctor wheeled about abruptly.

"Mr. Pendleton told me," nodded Pollyanna, again, "about the woman's hand and heart, or the child's presence, you know. Why don't you get a woman's hand and heart, Dr. Chilton? Or maybe you'd take Jimmy Bean—if Mr. Pendleton doesn't want him."

Dr. Chilton laughed a little constrainedly.

"So Mr. Pendleton says it takes a woman's hand and heart to make a home, does he?" he asked evasively.

"Yes. He says his is just a house, too. Why don't you, Dr. Chilton?"

"Why don't I—what?" The doctor had turned back to his desk.

"Get a woman's hand and heart. Oh—and I forgot." Pollyanna's face showed suddenly a painful color. "I suppose I ought to tell you. It wasn't Aunt Polly that Mr. Pendleton loved long ago; and so we—we aren't going there to live. You see, I told you it was—but I made a mistake. I hope you didn't tell any one," she finished anxiously.

"No—I didn't tell any one, Pollyanna," replied the doctor, a little queerly.

"Oh, that's all right, then," sighed Pollyanna in relief. "You see, you're the only one I told, and I thought Mr. Pendleton looked sort of funny when I said I'd told you."

"Did he?" The doctor's lips twitched.

"Yes. And of course he wouldn't want many people to know it—when 'twasn't true. But why don't you get a woman's hand and heart, Dr. Chilton?"

There was a moment's silence; then very gravely the doctor said:

"They're not always to be had—for the asking, little girl."

Pollyanna frowned thoughtfully.

"But I should think you could get 'em," she argued. The flattering emphasis was unmistakable.

"Thank you," laughed the doctor, with uplifted eyebrows. Then, gravely again: "I'm afraid some of your older sisters would not be quite so—confident. At least, they—they haven't shown themselves to be so—obliging," he observed.

Pollyanna frowned again. Then her eyes widened in surprise.

"Why, Dr. Chilton, you don't mean—you didn't try to get somebody's hand and heart once, like Mr. Pendleton, and—and couldn't, did you?"

The doctor got to his feet a little abruptly.

"There, there, Pollyanna, never mind about that now. Don't let other people's troubles worry your little head. Suppose you run back now to Mrs. Snow. I've written down the name of the medicine, and the directions how she is to take it. Was there anything else?"

Pollyanna shook her head.

"No, Sir; thank you, Sir," she murmured soberly, as she turned toward the door. From the little hallway she called back, her face suddenly alight: "Anyhow, I'm glad 'twasn't my mother's hand and heart that you wanted and couldn't get, Dr. Chilton. Good-by!"

It was on the last day of October that the accident occurred.Pollyanna, hurrying home from school, crossed the road at an apparently safe distance in front of a swiftly approaching motor car.

Just what happened, no one could seem to tell afterward. Neither was there any one found who could tell why it happened or who was to blame that it did happen. Pollyanna, however, at five o'clock, was borne, limp and unconscious, into the little room that was so dear to her. There, by a white-faced Aunt Polly and a weeping Nancy she was undressed tenderly and put to bed, while from the village, hastily summoned by telephone, Dr. Warren was hurrying as fast as another motor car could bring him.

"And ye didn't need ter more'n look at her aunt's face," Nancy was sobbing to Old Tom in the garden, after the doctor had arrived and was closeted in the hushed room; "ye didn't need ter more'n look at her aunt's face ter see that 'twa'n't no duty that was eatin' her. Yer hands don't shake, and yer eyes don't look as if ye was tryin' ter hold back the Angel o' Death himself, when you're jest doin' yer duty, Mr.Tom they don't, they don't!"

"Is she hurt—bad?" The old man's voice shook.

"There ain't no tellin'," sobbed Nancy. "She lay back that white an' still she might easy be dead; but Miss Polly said she wa'n't dead—an' Miss Polly had oughter know, if any one would—she kept up such a listenin' an' a feelin' for her heartbeats an' her breath!"

"Couldn't ye tell anythin' what it done to her?—that—that—" Old Tom's face worked convulsively.

Nancy's lips relaxed a little.

"I wish ye would call it somethin', Mr. Tom an' somethin' good an'strong, too. Drat it! Ter think of its runnin' down our little girl! I always hated the evil-smellin' things, anyhow—I did, I did!"

"But where is she hurt?"

"I don't know, I don't know," moaned Nancy. "There's a little cut on her blessed head, but 'tain't bad—that ain't—Miss Polly says. She says she's afraid it's infernally she's hurt."

A faint flicker came into Old Tom's eyes.

"I guess you mean internally, Nancy," he said dryly. "She's hurt infernally, all right—plague take that autymobile!—but I don't guess Miss Polly'd be usin' that word, all the same."

"Eh? Well, I don't know, I don't know," moaned Nancy, with a shake of her head as she turned away. "Seems as if I jest couldn't stand it till that doctor gits out o' there. I wish I had a washin' ter do—the biggest washin' I ever see, I do, I do!" she wailed, wringing her hands helplessly.

Even after the doctor was gone, however, there seemed to be little that Nancy could tell Mr. Tom. There appeared to be no bones broken,and the cut was of slight consequence; but the doctor had looked very grave, had shaken his head slowly, and had said that time alone could tell. After he had gone, Miss Polly had shown a face even whiter and more drawn looking than before. The patient had not fully recovered consciousness, but at present she seemed to be resting as comfortably as could be expected. A trained nurse had been sent for, and would come that night. That was all. And Nancy turned sobbingly, and went back to her kitchen.

It was sometime during the next forenoon that Pollyanna opened conscious eyes and realized where she was.

"Why, Aunt Polly, what's the matter? Isn't it daytime? Why don't I get up?" she cried. "Why, Aunt Polly, I can't get up," she moaned,falling back on the pillow, after an ineffectual attempt to lift herself.

"No, dear, I wouldn't try—just yet," soothed her aunt quickly, but very quietly.

"But what is the matter? Why can't I get up?"

Miss Polly's eyes asked an agonized question of the white-capped young woman standing in the window, out of the range of Pollyanna's eyes.

The young woman nodded.

"Tell her," the lips said.

Miss Polly cleared her throat, and tried to swallow the lump that would scarcely let her speak.

"You were hurt, dear, by the automobile last night. But never mind that now. Auntie wants you to rest and go to sleep again."

"Hurt? Oh, yes; I—I ran." Pollyanna's eyes were dazed. She lifted her hand to her forehead. "Why, it's—done up, and it—hurts!"

"Yes, dear; but never mind. Just—just rest."

"But, Aunt Polly, I feel so funny, and so bad! My legs feel so—so queer—only they don't feel—at all!"

With an imploring look into the nurse's face, Miss Polly struggled to her feet, and turned away. The nurse came forward quickly.

"Suppose you let me talk to you now," she began cheerily. "I'm sure I think it's high time we were getting acquainted, and I'm going to introduce myself. I am Miss Hunt, and I've come to help your aunt take care of you. And the very first thing I'm going to do is to ask you to swallow these little white pills for me."

Pollyanna's eyes grew a bit wild.

"But I don't want to be taken care of—that is, not for long! I want to get up. You know I go to school. Can't I go to school to-morrow?"

From the window where Aunt Polly stood now there came a half-stifled cry.

"To-morrow?" smiled the nurse, brightly.

"Well, I may not let you out quite so soon as that, Miss Pollyanna. But just swallow these little pills for me, please, and we'll see what they'll do."

"All right," agreed Pollyanna, somewhat doubtfully; "but I must go to school day after to-morrow—there are examinations then, you know."

She spoke again, a minute later. She spoke of school, and of the automobile, and of how her head ached; but very soon her voice trailed into silence under the blessed influence of the little white pills she had swallowed.





Chapter XXIV. John Pendleton


Pollyanna did not go to school "to-morrow," nor the "day after to-morrow." Pollyanna, however, did not realize this, except momentarily when a brief period of full consciousness sent insistent questions to her lips. Pollyanna did not realize anything, in fact, very clearly until a week had passed; then the fever subsided, the pain lessened somewhat, and her mind awoke to full consciousness. She had then to be told all over again what had occurred.

"And so it's hurt that I am, and not sick," she sighed at last. "Well, I'm glad of that."

"G-glad, Pollyanna?" asked her aunt, who was sitting by the bed.

"Yes. I'd so much rather have broken legs like Mr. Pendleton's than life-long-invalids like Mrs. Snow, you know. Broken legs get well, and lifelong-invalids don't."

Miss Polly—who had said nothing whatever about broken legs—got suddenly to her feet and walked to the little dressing table across the room. She was picking up one object after another now, and putting each down, in an aimless fashion quite unlike her usual decisiveness. Her face was not aimless-looking at all, however; it was white and drawn.

On the bed Pollyanna lay blinking at the dancing band of colors on the ceiling, which came from one of the prisms in the window.

"I'm glad it isn't smallpox that ails me, too," she murmured contentedly. "That would be worse than freckles. And I'm glad 'tisn't whooping cough—I've had that, and it's horrid—and I'm glad 'tisn't appendicitis nor measles, 'cause they're catching—measles are, I mean—and they wouldn't let you stay here."

"You seem to—to be glad for a good many things, my dear," faltered Aunt Polly, putting her hand to her throat as if her collar bound.

Pollyanna laughed softly.

"I am. I've been thinking of 'em—lots of 'em—all the time I've been looking up at that rainbow. I love rainbows. I'm so glad Mr.Pendleton gave me those prisms! I'm glad of some things I haven't said yet. I don't know but I'm 'most glad I was hurt."

"Pollyanna!"

Pollyanna laughed softly again. She turned luminous eyes on her aunt. "Well, you see, since I have been hurt, you've called me 'dear' lots of times—and you didn't before. I love to be called 'dear'—by folks that belong to you, I mean. Some of the Ladies' Aiders did call me that; and of course that was pretty nice, but not so nice as if they had belonged to me, like you do. Oh, Aunt Polly, I'm so glad you belong to me!"

Aunt Polly did not answer. Her hand was at her throat again. Her eyes were full of tears. She had turned away and was hurrying from the room through the door by which the nurse had just entered.





It was that afternoon that Nancy ran out to Old Tom, who was cleaning harnesses in the barn. Her eyes were wild.

"Mr. Tom, Mr. Tom, guess what's happened," she panted. "You couldn't guess in a thousand years—you couldn't, you couldn't!"

"Then I cal'late I won't try," retorted the man, grimly, "specially as I hain't got more'n ten ter live, anyhow, probably. You'd better tell me first off, Nancy."

"Well, listen, then. Who do you s'pose is in the parlor now, with the mistress? Who, I say?"

Old Tom shook his head.

"There's no tellin'," he declared.

"Yes, there is. I'm tellin'. It's—John Pendleton!"

"Sho, now! You're jokin', girl."

"Not much I am—an' me a-lettin' him in myself—crutches an' all!An' the team he come in a-waitin' this minute at the door for him, jest as if he wa'n't the cranky old crosspatch he is, what never talks ter no one! jest think, Mr. Tom—him a-callin' on her!"

"Well, why not?" demanded the old man, a little aggressively.

Nancy gave him a scornful glance.

"As if you didn't know better'n me!" she derided.

"Eh?"

"Oh, you needn't be so innercent," she retorted with mock indignation; "—you what led me wildgoose chasin' in the first place!"

"What do ye mean?"

Nancy glanced through the open barn door toward the house, and came a step nearer to the old man.

"Listen! 'Twas you that was tellin' me Miss Polly had a lover in the first place, wa'n't it? Well, one day I thinks I finds two and two, and I puts 'em tergether an' makes four. But it turns out ter be five—an' no four at all, at all!"

With a gesture of indifference Old Tom turned and fell to work.

"If you're goin' ter talk ter me, you've got ter talk plain horse sense," he declared testily. "I never was no hand for figgers."

Nancy laughed.

"Well, it's this," she explained. "I heard somethin' that made me think him an' Miss Polly was lovers."

"Mr. Pendleton!" Old Tom straightened up.

"Yes. Oh, I know now; he wasn't. It was that blessed child's mother he was in love with, and that's why he wanted—but never mind that part," she added hastily, remembering just in time her promise to Pollyanna not to tell that Mr. Pendleton had wished her to come and live with him. "Well, I've been askin' folks about him some, since, and I've found out that him an' Miss Polly hain't been friends for years, an' that she's been hatin' him like pizen owin' ter the silly gossip that coupled their names tergether when she was eighteen or twenty."

"Yes, I remember," nodded Old Tom. "It was three or four years after Miss Jennie give him the mitten and went off with the other chap.Miss Polly knew about it, of course, and was sorry for him. So she tried ter be nice to him. Maybe she overdid it a little—she hated that minister chap so who had took off her sister. At any rate, somebody begun ter make trouble. They said she was runnin' after him."

"Runnin' after any man—her!" interjected Nancy.

"I know it; but they did," declared Old Tom, "and of course no gal of any spunk'll stand that. Then about that time come her own lover an' the trouble with him. After that she shut up like an oyster an' wouldn't have nothin' ter do with nobody fur a spell. Her heart jest seemed to turn bitter at the core."

"Yes, I know. I've heard about that now," rejoined Nancy, "an'that's why you could 'a' knocked me down with a feather when I see him at the door—him, what she hain't spoke to for years! But I let him in an' went an' told her."

"What did she say?" Old Tom held his breath suspended.

"Nothin'—at first. She was so still I thought she hadn't heard; and I was jest goin' ter say it over when she speaks up quiet like: 'Tell Mr.Pendleton I will be down at once.' An' I come an' told him. Then I come out here an' told you," finished Nancy, casting another backward glance toward the house.

"Humph!" grunted Old Tom; and fell to work again.

In the ceremonious "parlor" of the Harrington homestead, Mr.John Pendleton did not have to wait long before a swift step warned him of Miss Polly's coming. As he attempted to rise, she made a gesture of remonstrance. She did not offer her hand, however, and her face was coldly reserved.

"I called to ask for—Pollyanna," he began at once, a little brusquely.

"Thank you. She is about the same," said Miss Polly.

"And that is—won't you tell me how she is?" His voice was not quite steady this time.

A quick spasm of pain crossed the woman's face.

"I can't, I wish I could!"

"You mean—you don't know?"

"Yes."

"But—the doctor?"

"Dr. Warren himself seems—at sea. He is in correspondence now with a New York specialist. They have arranged for a consultation at once."

"But—but what were her injuries that you do know?"

"A slight cut on the head, one or two bruises, and—and an injury to the spine which has seemed to cause—paralysis from the hips down."

A low cry came from the man. There was a brief silence; then, huskily, he asked:

"And Pollyanna—how does she—take it?"

"She doesn't understand—at all—how things really are. And I can't tell her."

"But she must know—something!"

Miss Polly lifted her hand to the collar at her throat in the gesture that had become so common to her of late.

"Oh, yes. She knows she can't—move; but she thinks her legs are—broken. She says she's glad it's broken legs like yours rather than 'lifelong-invalids' like Mrs. Snow's; because broken legs get well, and the other—doesn't. She talks like that all the time, until it—it seems as if I should—die!"

Through the blur of tears in his own eyes, the man saw the drawn face opposite, twisted with emotion. Involuntarily his thoughts went back to what Pollyanna had said when he had made his final plea for her presence: "Oh, I couldn't leave Aunt Polly—now!"

It was this thought that made him ask very gently, as soon as he could control his voice:

"I wonder if you know, Miss Harrington, how hard I tried to get Pollyanna to come and live with me."

"With you!—Pollyanna!"

The man winced a little at the tone of her voice; but his own voice was still impersonally cool when he spoke again.

"Yes. I wanted to adopt her—legally, you understand; making her my heir, of course."

The woman in the opposite chair relaxed a little. It came to her, suddenly, what a brilliant future it would have meant for Pollyanna—this adoption; and she wondered if Pollyanna were old enough and mercenary enough—to be tempted by this man's money and position.

"I am very fond of Pollyanna," the man was continuing. "I am fond of her both for her own sake, and for—her mother's. I stood ready to give Pollyanna the love that had been twenty-five years in storage."

"Love." Miss Polly remembered suddenly why she had taken this child in the first place—and with the recollection came the remembrance of Pollyanna's own words uttered that very morning: "I love to be called 'dear' by folks that belong to you!" And it was this love-hungry little girl that had been offered the stored-up affection of twenty-five years:—and she was old enough to be tempted by love!With a sinking heart Miss Polly realized that. With a sinking heart, too, she realized something else: the dreariness of her own future now without Pollyanna.

"Well?" she said. And the man, recognizing the self-control that vibrated through the harshness of the tone, smiled sadly.

"She would not come," he answered.

"Why?"

"She would not leave you. She said you had been so good to her.She wanted to stay with you—and she said she thought you wanted her to stay," he finished, as he pulled himself to his feet.

He did not look toward Miss Polly. He turned his face resolutely toward the door. But instantly he heard a swift step at his side, and found a shaking hand thrust toward him.

"When the specialist comes, and I know anything—definite about Pollyanna, I will let you hear from me," said a trembling voice. "Good-by—and thank you for coming. Pollyanna will be pleased."





Chapter XXV. A Waiting Game


On the day after John Pendleton's call at the Harrington homestead, Miss Polly set herself to the task of preparing Pollyanna for the visit of the specialist.

"Pollyanna, my dear," she began gently, "we have decided that we want another doctor besides Dr. Warren to see you. Another one might tell us something new to do—to help you get well faster, you know."

A joyous light came to Pollyanna's face.

"Dr. Chilton! Oh, Aunt Polly, I'd so love to have Dr. Chilton! I've wanted him all the time, but I was afraid you didn't, on account of his seeing you in the sun-parlor that day, you know; so I didn't like to say anything. But I'm so glad you do want him!"

Aunt Polly's face had turned white, then red, then back to white again. But when she answered, she showed very plainly that she was trying to speak lightly and cheerfully.

"Oh, no, dear! It wasn't Dr. Chilton at all that I meant. It is a new doctor—a very famous doctor from New York, who—who knows a great deal about—about hurts like yours."

Pollyanna's face fell.

"I don't believe he knows half so much as Dr. Chilton."

"Oh, yes, he does, I'm sure, dear."

"But it was Dr. Chilton who doctored Mr. Pendleton's broken leg, Aunt Polly. If—if you don't mind very much, I would like to have Dr.Chilton—truly I would!"

A distressed color suffused Miss Polly's face. For a moment she did not speak at all; then she said gently—though yet with a touch of her old stern decisiveness:

"But I do mind, Pollyanna. I mind very much. I would do anything—almost anything for you, my dear; but I—for reasons which I do not care to speak of now, I don't wish Dr. Chilton called in on—on this case. And believe me, he can not know so much about—about your trouble, as this great doctor does, who will come from New York to-morrow."

Pollyanna still looked unconvinced.

"But, Aunt Polly, if you loved Dr. Chilton—"

"What, Pollyanna?" Aunt Polly's voice was very sharp now. Her cheeks were very red, too.

"I say, if you loved Dr. Chilton, and didn't love the other one," sighed Pollyanna, "seems to me that would make some difference in the good he would do; and I love Dr. Chilton."

The nurse entered the room at that moment, and Aunt Polly rose to her feet abruptly, a look of relief on her face.

"I am very sorry, Pollyanna," she said, a little stiffly; "but I'm afraid you'll have to let me be the judge, this time. Besides, it's already arranged. The New York doctor is coming to-morrow."

As it happened, however, the New York doctor did not come "to-morrow." At the last moment a telegram told of an unavoidable delay owing to the sudden illness of the specialist himself. This led Pollyanna into a renewed pleading for the substitution of Dr. Chilton—"which would be so easy now, you know."

But as before, Aunt Polly shook her head and said "No, dear," very decisively, yet with a still more anxious assurance that she would do anything—anything but that—to please her dear Pollyanna.

As the days of waiting passed, one by one, it did indeed, seem that Aunt Polly was doing everything (but that) that she could do to please her niece.

"I wouldn't 'a' believed it—you couldn't 'a' made me believe it," Nancy said to Old Tom one morning. "There don't seem ter be a minute in the day that Miss Polly ain't jest hangin' 'round waitin' ter do somethin' for that blessed lamb if 'tain't more than ter let in the cat—an' her what wouldn't let Fluff nor Buff up-stairs for love nor money a week ago; an' now she lets 'em tumble all over the bed jest 'cause it pleases Miss Pollyanna!

"An' when she ain't doin' nothin' else, she's movin' them little glass danglers 'round ter diff'rent winders in the room so the sun'll make the 'rainbows dance', as that blessed child calls it. She's sent Timothy down ter Cobb's greenhouse three times for fresh flowers—an'that besides all the posies fetched in ter her, too. An' the other day, if I didn't find her sittin' 'fore the bed with the nurse actually doin' her hair, an' Miss Pollyanna lookin' on an' bossin' from the bed, her eyes all shinin' an' happy. An' I declare ter goodness, if Miss Polly hain't wore her hair like that every day now—jest ter please that blessed child!"

Old Tom chuckled.

"Well, it strikes me Miss Polly herself ain't lookin' none the worse—for wearin' them 'ere curls 'round her forehead," he observed dryly.

"'Course she ain't," retorted Nancy, indignantly. "She looks like folks, now. She's actually almost—"

"Keerful, now, Nancy!" interrupted the old man, with a slow grin. "You know what you said when I told ye she was handsome once."

Nancy shrugged her shoulders.

"Oh, she ain't handsome, of course; but I will own up she don't look like the same woman, what with the ribbons an' lace jiggers Miss Pollyanna makes her wear 'round her neck."

"I told ye so," nodded the man. "I told ye she wa'n't—old."

Nancy laughed.

"Well, I'll own up she hain't got quite so good an imitation of it—as she did have, 'fore Miss Pollyanna come. Say, Mr. Tom, who was her A lover? I hain't found that out, yet; I hain't, I hain't!"

"Hain't ye?" asked the old man, with an odd look on his face. "Well, I guess ye won't then from me."

"Oh, Mr. Tom, come on, now," wheedled the girl. "Ye see, there ain't many folks here that I can ask."

"Maybe not. But there's one, anyhow, that ain't answerin'," grinned Old Tom. Then, abruptly, the light died from his eyes. "How is she, ter-day—the little gal?"

Nancy shook her head. Her face, too, had sobered.

"Just the same, Mr. Tom. There ain't no special diff'rence, as I can see—or anybody, I guess. She jest lays there an' sleeps an' talks some, an' tries ter smile an' be 'glad' 'cause the sun sets or the moon rises, or some other such thing, till it's enough ter make yer heart break with achin'."

"I know; it's the 'game'—bless her sweet heart!" nodded Old Tom, blinking a little.

"She told you, then, too, about that 'ere—game?"

"Oh, yes. She told me long ago." The old man hesitated, then went on, his lips twitching a little. "I was growlin' one day 'cause I was so bent up and crooked; an' what do ye s'pose the little thing said?"

"I couldn't guess. I wouldn't think she could find anythin' about that ter be glad about!"

"She did. She said I could be glad, anyhow, that I didn't have ter stoop so far ter do my weedin' 'cause I was already bent part way over."

Nancy gave a wistful laugh.

"Well, I ain't surprised, after all. You might know she'd find somethin'. We've been playin' it—that game—since almost the first, 'cause there wa'n't no one else she could play it with—though she did speak of—her aunt."

"Miss Polly!"

Nancy chuckled.

"I guess you hain't got such an awful diff'rent opinion o' the mistress than I have," she bridled.

Old Tom stiffened.

"I was only thinkin' 'twould be—some of a surprise—to her," he explained with dignity.

"Well, yes, I guess 'twould be—then," retorted Nancy. "I ain't sayin' what 'twould be now. I'd believe anythin' o' the mistress now—even that she'd take ter playin' it herself!"

"But hain't the little gal told her—ever? She's told ev'ry one else, I guess. I'm hearin' of it ev'rywhere, now, since she was hurted," said Tom.

"Well, she didn't tell Miss Polly," rejoined Nancy. "Miss Pollyanna told me long ago that she couldn't tell her, 'cause her aunt didn't like ter have her talk about her father; an' 'twas her father's game, an' she'd have ter talk about him if she did tell it. So she never told her."

"Oh, I see, I see." The old man nodded his head slowly. "They was always bitter against the minister chap—all of 'em, 'cause he took Miss Jennie away from 'em. An' Miss Polly—young as she was—couldn't never forgive him; she was that fond of Miss Jennie—in them days. I see, I see. 'Twas a bad mess," he sighed, as he turned away.

"Yes, 'twas—all 'round, all 'round," sighed Nancy in her turn, as she went back to her kitchen.

For no one were those days of waiting easy. The nurse tried to look cheerful, but her eyes were troubled. The doctor was openly nervous and impatient. Miss Polly said little; but even the softening waves of hair about her face, and the becoming laces at her throat, could not hide the fact that she was growing thin and pale. As to Pollyanna—Pollyanna petted the dog, smoothed the cat's sleek head, admired the flowers and ate the fruits and jellies that were sent in to her; and returned innumerable cheery answers to the many messages of love and inquiry that were brought to her bedside. But she, too, grew pale and thin; and the nervous activity of the poor little hands and arms only emphasized the pitiful motionlessness of the once active little feet and legs now lying so woefully quiet under the blankets.

As to the game—Pollyanna told Nancy these days how glad she was going to be when she could go to school again, go to see Mrs.Snow, go to call on Mr. Pendleton, and go to ride with Dr. Chilton nor did she seem to realize that all this "gladness" was in the future, not the present. Nancy, however, did realize it—and cry about it, when she was alone.





Chapter XXVI. A Door Ajar


Just a week from the time Dr. Mead, the specialist, was first expected, he came. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man with kind gray eyes, and a cheerful smile. Pollyanna liked him at once, and told him so.

"You look quite a lot like my doctor, you see," she added engagingly.

"Your doctor?" Dr. Mead glanced in evident surprise at Dr. Warren, talking with the nurse a few feet away. Dr. Warren was a small, brown-eyed man with a pointed brown beard.

"Oh, that isn't my doctor," smiled Pollyanna, divining his thought. "Dr. Warren is Aunt Polly's doctor. My doctor is Dr. Chilton."

"Oh-h!" said Dr. Mead, a little oddly, his eyes resting on Miss Polly, who, with a vivid blush, had turned hastily away.

"Yes." Pollyanna hesitated, then continued with her usual truthfulness. "You see, I wanted Dr. Chilton all the time, but Aunt Polly wanted you. She said you knew more than Dr. Chilton, anyway about—about broken legs like mine. And of course if you do, I can be glad for that. Do you?"

A swift something crossed the doctor's face that Pollyanna could not quite translate.

"Only time can tell that, little girl," he said gently; then he turned a grave face toward Dr. Warren, who had just come to the bedside.





Every one said afterward that it was the cat that did it. Certainly, if Fluffy had not poked an insistent paw and nose against Pollyanna's unlatched door, the door would not have swung noiselessly open on its hinges until it stood perhaps a foot ajar; and if the door had not been open, Pollyanna would not have heard her aunt's words.

In the hall the two doctors, the nurse, and Miss Polly stood talking.In Pollyanna's room Fluffy had just jumped to the bed with a little purring "meow" of joy when through the open door sounded clearly and sharply Aunt Polly's agonized exclamation.

"Not that! Doctor, not that! You don't mean—the child—will never walk again!"

It was all confusion then. First, from the bedroom came Pollyanna's terrified "Aunt Polly Aunt Polly!" Then Miss Polly, seeing the open door and realizing that her words had been heard, gave a low little moan and—for the first time in her life—fainted dead away.

The nurse, with a choking "She heard!" stumbled toward the open door. The two doctors stayed with Miss Polly. Dr. Mead had to stay—he had caught Miss Polly as she fell. Dr. Warren stood by, helplessly. It was not until Pollyanna cried out again sharply and the nurse closed the door, that the two men, with a despairing glance into each other's eyes, awoke to the immediate duty of bringing the woman in Dr. Mead's arms back to unhappy consciousness.

In Pollyanna's room, the nurse had found a purring gray cat on the bed vainly trying to attract the attention of a white-faced, wild-eyed little girl.

"Miss Hunt, please, I want Aunt Polly. I want her right away, quick, please!"

The nurse closed the door and came forward hurriedly. Her face was very pale.

"She—she can't come just this minute, dear. She will—a little later. What is it? Can't I—get it?"

Pollyanna shook her head.

"But I want to know what she said—just now. Did you hear her? I want Aunt Polly—she said something. I want her to tell me 'tisn't true—'tisn't true!"

The nurse tried to speak, but no words came. Something in her face sent an added terror to Pollyanna's eyes.

"Miss Hunt, you did hear her! It is true! Oh, it isn't true! You don't mean I can't ever—walk again?"

"There, there, dear—don't, don't!" choked the nurse. "Perhaps he didn't know. Perhaps he was mistaken. There's lots of things that could happen, you know."

"But Aunt Polly said he did know! She said he knew more than anybody else about—about broken legs like mine!"

"Yes, yes, I know, dear; but all doctors make mistakes sometimes.Just—just don't think any more about it now—please don't, dear."

Pollyanna flung out her arms wildly. "But I can't help thinking about it," she sobbed. "It's all there is now to think about. Why, Miss Hunt, how am I going to school, or to see Mr. Pendleton, or Mrs.Snow, or—or anybody?" She caught her breath and sobbed wildly for a moment. Suddenly she stopped and looked up, a new terror in her eyes. "Why, Miss Hunt, if I can't walk, how am I ever going to be glad for—anything?"

Miss Hunt did not know "the game"; but she did know that her patient must be quieted, and that at once. In spite of her own perturbation and heartache, her hands had not been idle, and she stood now at the bedside with the quieting powder ready.

"There, there, dear, just take this," she soothed; "and by and by we'll be more rested, and we'll see what can be done then. Things aren't half as bad as they seem, dear, lots of times, you know."

Obediently Pollyanna took the medicine, and sipped the water from the glass in Miss Hunt's hand.

"I know; that sounds like things father used to say," faltered Pollyanna, blinking off the tears. "He said there was always something about everything that might be worse; but I reckon he'd never just heard he couldn't ever walk again. I don't see how there can be anything about that, that could be worse—do you?"

Miss Hunt did not reply. She could not trust herself to speak just then.





Chapter XXVII. Two Visits


It was Nancy who was sent to tell Mr. John Pendleton of Dr.Mead's verdict. Miss Polly had remembered her promise to let him have direct information from the house. To go herself, or to write a letter, she felt to be almost equally out of the question. It occurred to her then to send Nancy.

There had been a time when Nancy would have rejoiced greatly at this extraordinary opportunity to see something of the House of Mystery and its master. But to-day her heart was too heavy to, rejoice at anything. She scarcely even looked about her at all, indeed, during the few minutes, she waited for Mr. John Pendleton to appear.

"I'm Nancy, sir," she said respectfully, in response to the surprised questioning of his eyes, when he came into the room. "Miss Harrington sent me to tell you about—Miss Pollyanna."

"Well?"

In spite of the curt terseness of the word, Nancy quite understood the anxiety that lay behind that short "well?"

"It ain't well, Mr. Pendleton," she choked.

"You don't mean—" He paused, and she bowed her head miserably.

"Yes, sir. He says—she can't walk again—never."

For a moment there was absolute silence in the room; then the man spoke, in a voice shaken with emotion.

"Poor—little—girl! Poor—little—girl!"

Nancy glanced at him, but dropped her eyes at once. She had not supposed that sour, cross, stern John Pendleton could look like that. In a moment he spoke again, still in the low, unsteady voice.

"It seems cruel—never to dance in the sunshine again! My little prism girl!"

There was another silence; then, abruptly, the man asked:

"She herself doesn't know yet—of course—does she?"

"But she does, sir." sobbed Nancy, "an' that's what makes it all the harder. She found out—drat that cat! I begs yer pardon," apologized the girl, hurriedly. "It's only that the cat pushed open the door an' Miss Pollyanna overheard 'em talkin'. She found out—that way."

"Poor—little—girl!" sighed the man again.

"Yes, sir. You'd say so, sir, if you could see her," choked Nancy. "I hain't seen her but twice since she knew about it, an' it done me up both times. Ye see it's all so fresh an' new to her, an' she keeps thinkin' all the time of new things she can't do—now. It worries her, too, 'cause she can't seem ter be glad—maybe you don't know about her game, though," broke off Nancy, apologetically.

"The 'glad game'?" asked the man. "Oh, yes, she told me of that."

"Oh, she did! Well, I guess she has told it generally ter most folks.But ye see, now she—she can't play it herself, an' it worries her. She says she can't think of a thing—not a thing about this not walkin' again, ter be glad about."

"Well, why should she?" retorted the man, almost savagely.

Nancy shifted her feet uneasily.

"That's the way I felt, too—till I happened ter think—it would be easier if she could find somethin', ye know. So I tried to—to remind her."

"To remind her! Of what?" John Pendleton's voice was still angrily impatient.

"Of—of how she told others ter play it Mis' Snow, and the rest, ye know—and what she said for them ter do. But the poor little lamb just cries, an' says it don't seem the same, somehow. She says it's easy ter tell lifelong invalids how ter be glad, but 'tain't the same thing when you're the lifelong invalid yerself, an' have ter try ter do it. She says she's told herself over an' over again how glad she is that other folks ain't like her; but that all the time she's sayin' it, she ain't really thinkin' of anythin' only how she can't ever walk again."

Nancy paused, but the man did not speak. He sat with his hand over his eyes.

"Then I tried ter remind her how she used ter say the game was all the nicer ter play when—when it was hard," resumed Nancy, in a dull voice. "But she says that, too, is diff'rent—when it really is hard. An' I must be goin', now, sir," she broke off abruptly.

At the door she hesitated, turned, and asked timidly:

"I couldn't be tellin' Miss Pollyanna that—that you'd seen Jimmy Bean again, I s'pose, sir, could I?"

"I don't see how you could—as I haven't seen him," observed the man a little shortly. "Why?"

"Nothin', sir, only—well, ye see, that's one of the things that she was feelin' bad about, that she couldn't take him ter see you, now. She said she'd taken him once, but she didn't think he showed off very well that day, and that she was afraid you didn't think he would make a very nice child's presence, after all. Maybe you know what she means by that; but I didn't, sir."

"Yes, I know—what she means."

"All right, sir. It was only that she was wantin' ter take him again, she said, so's ter show ye he really was a lovely child's presence. And now she—can't—drat that autymobile! I begs yer pardon, sir. Good-by!" And Nancy fled precipitately.

It did not take long for the entire town of Beldingsville to learn that the great New York doctor had said Pollyanna Whittier would never walk again; and certainly never before had the town been so stirred.Everybody knew by sight now the piquant little freckled face that had always a smile of greeting; and almost everybody knew of the "game" that Pollyanna was playing. To think that now never again would that smiling face be seen on their streets—never again would that cheery little voice proclaim the gladness of some everyday experience! It seemed unbelievable, impossible, cruel.

In kitchens and sitting-rooms, and over back-yard fences women talked of it, and wept openly. On street corners and in store lounging-places the men talked, too, and wept—though not so openly. And neither the talking nor the weeping grew less when fast on the heels of the news itself, came Nancy's pitiful story that Pollyanna, face to face with what had come to her, was bemoaning most of all the fact that she could not play the game; that she could not now be glad over—anything.

It was then that the same thought must have, in some way, come to Pollyanna's friends. At all events, almost at once, the mistress of the Harrington homestead, greatly to her surprise, began to receive calls: calls from people she knew, and people she did not know; calls from men, women, and children—many of whom Miss Polly had not supposed that her niece knew at all.

Some came in and sat down for a stiff five or ten minutes. Some stood awkwardly on the porch steps, fumbling with hats or hand-bags, according to their sex. Some brought a book, a bunch of flowers, or a dainty to tempt the palate. Some cried frankly. Some turned their backs and blew their noses furiously. But all inquired very anxiously for the little injured girl; and all sent to her some message—and it was these messages which, after a time, stirred Miss Polly to action.

First came Mr. John Pendleton. He came without his crutches to-day.

"I don't need to tell you how shocked I am," he began almost harshly. "But can—nothing be done?"

Miss Polly gave a gesture of despair.

"Oh, we're 'doing', of course, all the time. Dr. Mead prescribed certain treatments and medicines that might help, and Dr. Warren is carrying them out to the letter, of course. But—Dr. Mead held out almost no hope."

John Pendleton rose abruptly—though he had but just come. His face was white, and his mouth was set into stern lines. Miss Polly, looking at him, knew very well why he felt that he could not stay longer in her presence. At the door he turned.

"I have a message for Pollyanna," he said. "Will you tell her, please, that I have seen Jimmy Bean and—that he's going to be my boy hereafter. Tell her I thought she would be—glad to know. I shall adopt him, probably."

For a brief moment Miss Polly lost her usual well-bred self-control.

"You will adopt Jimmy Bean!" she gasped.

The man lifted his chin a little.

"Yes. I think Pollyanna will understand. You will tell her I thought she would be—glad!"

"Why, of—of course," faltered Miss Polly.

"Thank you," bowed John Pendleton, as he turned to go.

In the middle of the floor Miss Polly stood, silent and amazed, still looking after the man who had just left her. Even yet she could scarcely believe what her ears had heard. John Pendleton adopt Jimmy Bean? John Pendleton, wealthy, independent, morose, reputed to be miserly and supremely selfish, to adopt a little boy—and such a little boy?

With a somewhat dazed face Miss Polly went up-stairs to Pollyanna's room.

"Pollyanna, I have a message for you from Mr. John Pendleton. He has just been here. He says to tell you he has taken Jimmy Bean for his little boy. He said he thought you'd be glad to know it."

Pollyanna's wistful little face flamed into sudden joy.

"Glad? Glad? Well, I reckon I am glad! Oh, Aunt Polly, I've so wanted to find a place for Jimmy—and that's such a lovely place!Besides, I'm so glad for Mr. Pendleton, too. You see, now he'll have the child's presence."

"The—what?"

Pollyanna colored painfully. She had forgotten that she had never told her aunt of Mr. Pendleton's desire to adopt her—and certainly she would not wish to tell her now that she had ever thought for a minute of leaving her—this dear Aunt Polly!

"The child's presence," stammered Pollyanna, hastily. "Mr.Pendleton told me once, you see, that only a woman's hand and heart or a child's presence could make a—a home. And now he's got it—the child's presence."

"Oh, I—see," said Miss Polly very gently; and she did see—more than Pollyanna realized. She saw something of the pressure that was probably brought to bear on Pollyanna herself at the time John Pendleton was asking her to be the "child's presence", which was to transform his great pile of gray stone into a home. "I see," she finished, her eyes stinging with sudden tears.

Pollyanna, fearful that her aunt might ask further embarrassing questions, hastened to lead the conversation away from the Pendleton house and its master.

"Dr. Chilton says so, too—that it takes a woman's hand and heart, or a child's presence, to make a home, you know," she remarked.

Miss Polly turned with a start.

"Dr. Chilton! How do you know—that?"

"He told me so. 'Twas when he said he lived in just rooms, you know—not a home."

Miss Polly did not answer. Her eyes were out the window.

"So I asked him why he didn't get 'em—a woman's hand and heart, and have a home."

"Pollyanna!" Miss Polly had turned sharply. Her cheeks showed a sudden color.

"Well, I did. He looked so—so sorrowful."

"What did he—say?" Miss Polly asked the question as if in spite of some force within her that was urging her not to ask it.

"He didn't say anything for a minute; then he said very low that you couldn't always get 'em for the asking."

There was a brief silence. Miss Polly's eyes had turned again to the window. Her cheeks were still unnaturally pink.

Pollyanna sighed.

"He wants one, anyhow, I know, and I wish he could have one."

"Why, Pollyanna, how do you know?"

"Because, afterwards, on another day, he said something else. He said that low, too, but I heard him. He said that he'd give all the world if he did have one woman's hand and heart. Why, Aunt Polly, what's the matter?" Aunt Polly had risen hurriedly and gone to the window.

"Nothing, dear. I was changing the position of this prism," said Aunt Polly, whose whole face now was aflame.





Chapter XXVIII. The Game and Its Players


It was not long after John Pendleton's second visit that Milly Snow called one afternoon. Milly Snow had never before been to the Harrington homestead. She blushed and looked very embarrassed when Miss Polly entered the room.

"I—I came to inquire for the little girl," she stammered.

"You are very kind. She is about the same. How is your mother?" rejoined Miss Polly, wearily.

"That is what I came to tell you—that is, to ask you to tell Miss Pollyanna," hurried on the girl, breathlessly and incoherently. "We think it's—so awful—so perfectly awful that the little thing can't ever walk again; and after all she's done for us, too—for mother, you know, teaching her to play the game, and all that. And when we heard how now she couldn't play it herself—poor little dear! I'm sure I don't see how she can, either, in her condition!—but when we remembered all the things she'd said to us, we thought if she could only know what she had done for us, that it would help, you know, in her own case, about the game, because she could be glad—that is, a little glad—" Milly stopped helplessly, and seemed to be waiting for Miss Polly to speak.

Miss Polly had sat politely listening, but with a puzzled questioning in her eyes. Only about half of what had been said, had she understood. She was thinking now that she always had known that Milly Snow was "queer," but she had not supposed she was crazy. In no other way, however, could she account for this incoherent, illogical, unmeaning rush of words. When the pause came she filled it with a quiet:

"I don't think I quite understand, Milly. Just what is it that you want me to tell my niece?"

"Yes, that's it; I want you to tell her," answered the girl, feverishly. "Make her see what she's done for us. Of course she's seen some things, because she's been there, and she's known mother is different; but I want her to know how different she is—and me, too. I'm different. I've been trying to play it—the game—a little."

Miss Polly frowned. She would have asked what Milly meant by this "game", but there was no opportunity. Milly was rushing on again with nervous volubility.

"You know nothing was ever right before—for mother. She was always wanting 'em different. And, really, I don't know as one could blame her much—under the circumstances. But now she lets me keep the shades up, and she takes interest in things—how she looks, and her nightdress, and all that. And she's actually begun to knit little things—reins and baby blankets for fairs and hospitals. And she's so interested, and so glad to think she can do it!—and that was all Miss Pollyanna's doings, you know, 'cause she told mother she could be glad she'd got her hands and arms, anyway; and that made mother wonder right away why she didn't do something with her hands and arms. And so she began to do something—to knit, you know. And you can't think what a different room it is now, what with the red and blue and yellow worsteds, and the prisms in the window that she gave her—why, it actually makes you feel better just to go in there now; and before I used to dread it awfully, it was so dark and gloomy, and mother was so—so unhappy, you know.

"And so we want you to please tell Miss Pollyanna that we understand it's all because of her. And please say we're so glad we know her, that we thought, maybe if she knew it, it would make her a little glad that she knew us. And—and that's all," sighed Milly, rising hurriedly to her feet. "You'll tell her?"

"Why, of course," murmured Miss Polly, wondering just how much of this remarkable discourse she could remember to tell.

These visits of John Pendleton and Milly Snow were only the first of many; and always there were the messages—the messages which were in some ways so curious that they caused Miss Polly more and more to puzzle over them.

One day there was the little Widow Benton. Miss Polly knew her well, though they had never called upon each other. By reputation she knew her as the saddest little woman in town—one who was always in black. To-day, however, Mrs. Benton wore a knot of pale blue at the throat, though there were tears in her eyes. She spoke of her grief and horror at the accident; then she asked diffidently if she might see Pollyanna.

Miss Polly shook her head.

"I am sorry, but she sees no one yet. A little later—perhaps."

Mrs. Benton wiped her eyes, rose, and turned to go. But after she had almost reached the hall door she came back hurriedly.

"Miss Harrington, perhaps, you'd give her—a message," she stammered.

"Certainly, Mrs. Benton; I shall be very glad to."

Still the little woman hesitated; then she spoke.

"Will you tell her, please, that—that I've put on this," she said, just touching the blue bow at her throat. Then, at Miss Polly's ill-concealed look of surprise, she added: "The little girl has been trying for so long to make me wear—some color, that I thought she'd be—glad to know I'd begun. She said that Freddy would be so glad to see it, if I would.You know Freddy's all I have now. The others have all—" Mrs. Benton shook her head and turned away. "If you'll just tell Pollyanna—she'll understand." And the door closed after her.

A little later, that same day, there was the other widow—at least, she wore widow's garments. Miss Polly did not know her at all. She wondered vaguely how Pollyanna could have known her. The lady gave her name as "Mrs. Tarbell."

"I'm a stranger to you, of course," she began at once. "But I'm not a stranger to your little niece, Pollyanna. I've been at the hotel all summer, and every day I've had to take long walks for my health. It was on these walks that I've met your niece—she's such a dear little girl! I wish I could make you understand what she's been to me. I was very sad when I came up here; and her bright face and cheery ways reminded me of—my own little girl that I lost years ago. I was so shocked to hear of the accident; and then when I learned that the poor child would never walk again, and that she was so unhappy because she couldn't be glad any longer—the dear child!—I just had to come to you."

"You are very kind," murmured Miss Polly.

"But it is you who are to be kind," demurred the other. "I—I want you to give her a message from me. Will you?"

"Certainly."

"Will you just tell her, then, that Mrs. Tarbell is glad now. Yes, I know it sounds odd, and you don't understand. But—if you'll pardon me I'd rather not explain." Sad lines came to the lady's mouth, and the smile left her eyes. "Your niece will know just what I mean; and I felt that I must tell—her. Thank you; and pardon me, please, for any seeming rudeness in my call," she begged, as she took her leave.

Thoroughly mystified now, Miss Polly hurried up-stairs to Pollyanna's room.

"Pollyanna, do you know a Mrs. Tarbell?"

"Oh, yes. I love Mrs. Tarbell. She's sick, and awfully sad; and she's at the hotel, and takes long walks. We go together. I mean—we used to." Pollyanna's voice broke, and two big tears rolled down her cheeks.

Miss Polly cleared her throat hurriedly.

"We'll, she's just been here, dear. She left a message for you—but she wouldn't tell me what it meant. She said to tell you that Mrs. Tarbell is glad now."

Pollyanna clapped her hands softly.

"Did she say that—really? Oh, I'm so glad!"

"But, Pollyanna, what did she mean?"

"Why, it's the game, and—" Pollyanna stopped short, her fingers to her lips.

"What game?"

"N-nothing much, Aunt Polly; that is—I can't tell it unless I tell other things that—that I'm not to speak of."

It was on Miss Polly's tongue to question her niece further; but the obvious distress on the little girl's face stayed the words before they were uttered.

Not long after Mrs. Tarbell's visit, the climax came. It came in the shape of a call from a certain young woman with unnaturally pink cheeks and abnormally yellow hair; a young woman who wore high heels and cheap jewelry; a young woman whom Miss Polly knew very well by reputation—but whom she was angrily amazed to meet beneath the roof of the Harrington homestead.

Miss Polly did not offer her hand. She drew back, indeed, as she entered the room.

The woman rose at once. Her eyes were very red, as if she had been crying. Half defiantly she asked if she might, for a moment, see the little girl, Pollyanna.

Miss Polly said no. She began to say it very sternly; but something in the woman's pleading eyes made her add the civil explanation that no one was allowed yet to see Pollyanna.

The woman hesitated; then a little brusquely she spoke. Her chin was still at a slightly defiant tilt.

"My name is Mrs. Payson—Mrs. Tom Payson. I presume you've heard of me—most of the good people in the town have—and maybe some of the things you've heard ain't true. But never mind that. It's about the little girl I came. I heard about the accident, and—and it broke me all up. Last week I heard how she couldn't ever walk again, and—and I wished I could give up my two uselessly well legs for hers. She'd do more good trotting around on 'em one hour than I could in a hundred years. But never mind that. Legs ain't always given to the one who can make the best use of 'em, I notice."

She paused, and cleared her throat; but when she resumed her voice was still husky.

"Maybe you don't know it, but I've seen a good deal of that little girl of yours. We live on the Pendleton Hill road, and she used to go by often—only she didn't always go by. She came in and played with the kids and talked to me—and my man, when he was home. She seemed to like it, and to like us. She didn't know, I suspect, that her kind of folks don't generally call on my kind. Maybe if they did call more, Miss Harrington, there wouldn't be so many—of my kind," she added, with sudden bitterness.

"Be that as it may, she came; and she didn't do herself no harm, and she did do us good—a lot o' good. How much she won't know—nor can't know, I hope; 'cause if she did, she'd know other things—that I don't want her to know.

"But it's just this. It's been hard times with us this year, in more ways than one. We've been blue and discouraged—my man and me, and ready for—'most anything. We was reckoning on getting a divorce about now, and letting the kids well, we didn't know what we would do with the kids. Then came the accident, and what we heard about the little girl's never walking again. And we got to thinking how she used to come and sit on our doorstep and train with the kids, and laugh, and—and just be glad. She was always being glad about something; and then, one day, she told us why, and about the game, you know; and tried to coax us to play it.

"Well, we've heard now that she's fretting her poor little life out of her, because she can't play it no more—that there's nothing to be glad about. And that's what I came to tell her to-day—that maybe she can be a little glad for us, 'cause we've decided to stick to each other, and play the game ourselves. I knew she would be glad, because she used to feel kind of bad—at things we said, sometimes. Just how the game is going to help us, I can't say that I exactly see, yet; but maybe 'twill. Anyhow, we're going to try—'cause she wanted us to. Will you tell her?"

"Yes, I will tell her," promised Miss Polly, a little faintly. Then, with sudden impulse, she stepped forward and held out her hand. "And thank you for coming, Mrs. Payson," she said simply.

The defiant chin fell. The lips above it trembled visibly. With an incoherently mumbled something, Mrs. Payson blindly clutched at the outstretched hand, turned, and fled.

The door had scarcely closed behind her before Miss Polly was confronting Nancy in the kitchen.

"Nancy!"

Miss Polly spoke sharply. The series of puzzling, disconcerting visits of the last few days, culminating as they had in the extraordinary experience of the afternoon, had strained her nerves to the snapping point. Not since Miss Pollyanna's accident had Nancy heard her mistress speak so sternly.

"Nancy, will you tell me what this absurd 'game' is that the whole town seems to be babbling about? And what, please, has my niece to do with it? Why does everybody, from Milly Snow to Mrs. Tom Payson,send word to her that they're 'playing it'? As near as I can judge, half the town are putting on blue ribbons, or stopping family quarrels, or learning to like something they never liked before, and all because of Pollyanna. I tried to ask the child herself about it, but I can't seem to make much headway, and of course I don't like to worry her—now. But from something I heard her say to you last night, I should judge you were one of them, too. Now will you tell me what it all means?"

To Miss Polly's surprise and dismay, Nancy burst into tears.

"It means that ever since last June that blessed child has jest been makin' the whole town glad, an' now they're turnin' 'round an' tryin' ter make her a little glad, too."

"Glad of what?"

"Just glad! That's the game."

Miss Polly actually stamped her foot.

"There you go like all the rest, Nancy. What game?"

Nancy lifted her chin. She faced her mistress and looked her squarely in the eye.

"I'll tell ye, ma'am. It's a game Miss Pollyanna's father learned her ter play. She got a pair of crutches once in a missionary barrel when she was wantin' a doll; an' she cried, of course, like any child would. It seems 'twas then her father told her that there wasn't ever anythin' but what there was somethin' about it that you could be glad about; an' that she could be glad about them crutches."

"Glad for—crutches!" Miss Polly choked back a sob—she was thinking of the helpless little legs on the bed up-stairs.

"Yes'm. That's what I said, an' Miss Pollyanna said that's what she said, too. But he told her she could be glad—'cause she didn't need'em."

"Oh-h!" cried Miss Polly.

"And after that she said he made a regular game of it—findin'somethin' in everythin' ter be glad about. An' she said ye could do it, too, and that ye didn't seem ter mind not havin' the doll so much, 'cause ye was so glad ye didn't need the crutches. An' they called it the 'jest bein' glad' game. That's the game, ma'am. She's played it ever since."

"But, how—how—" Miss Polly came to a helpless pause.

"An' you'd be surprised ter find how cute it works, ma'am, too," maintained Nancy, with almost the eagerness of Pollyanna herself. "I wish I could tell ye what a lot she's done for mother an' the folks out home. She's been ter see 'em, ye know, twice, with me. She's made me glad, too, on such a lot o' things—little things, an' big things; an' it's made 'em so much easier. For instance, I don't mind 'Nancy' for a name half as much since she told me I could be glad 'twa'n't 'Hephzibah'.An' there's Monday mornin's, too, that I used ter hate so. She's actually made me glad for Monday mornin's."

"Glad—for Monday mornings!"

Nancy laughed.

"I know it does sound nutty, ma'am. But let me tell ye. That blessed lamb found out I hated Monday mornin's somethin' awful; an'what does she up an' tell me one day but this: 'Well, anyhow, Nancy, I should think you could be gladder on Monday mornin' than on any other day in the week, because 'twould be a whole week before you'd have another one!' An' I'm blest if I hain't thought of it ev'ry Monday mornin' since—an' it has helped, ma'am. It made me laugh, anyhow, ev'ry time I thought of it; an' laughin' helps, ye know—it does, it does!"

"But why hasn't—she told me—the game?" faltered Miss Polly. "Why has she made such a mystery of it, when I asked her?"

Nancy hesitated.

"Beggin' yer pardon, ma'am, you told her not ter speak of—her father; so she couldn't tell ye. 'Twas her father's game, ye see."

Miss Polly bit her lip.

"She wanted ter tell ye, first off," continued Nancy, a little unsteadily. "She wanted somebody ter play it with, ye know. That's why I begun it, so she could have some one."

"And—and—these others?" Miss Polly's voice shook now.

"Oh, ev'rybody, 'most, knows it now, I guess. Anyhow, I should think they did from the way I'm hearin' of it ev'rywhere I go. Of course she told a lot, and they told the rest. Them things go, ye know, when they gets started. An' she was always so smilin' an' pleasant ter ev'ry one, an' so—so jest glad herself all the time, that they couldn't help knowin' it, anyhow. Now, since she's hurt, ev'rybody feels so bad—specially when they heard how bad she feels 'cause she can't find anythin' ter be glad about. An' so they've been comin' ev'ry day ter tell her how glad she's made THEM, hopin' that'll help some. Ye see, she's always wanted ev'rybody ter play the game with her."

"Well, I know somebody who'll play it—now," choked Miss Polly, as she turned and sped through the kitchen doorway.

Behind her, Nancy stood staring amazedly.

"Well, I'll believe anythin'—anythin' now," she muttered to herself. "Ye can't stump me with anythin' I wouldn't believe, now—o'Miss Polly!"

A little later, in Pollyanna's room, the nurse left Miss Polly and Pollyanna alone together.

"And you've had still another caller to-day, my dear," announced Miss Polly, in a voice she vainly tried to steady. "Do you remember Mrs. Payson?"

"Mrs. Payson? Why, I reckon I do! She lives on the way to Mr.Pendleton's, and she's got the prettiest little girl baby three years old, and a boy 'most five. She's awfully nice, and so's her husband—only they don't seem to know how nice each other is. Sometimes they fight—I mean, they don't quite agree. They're poor, too, they say, and of course they don't ever have barrels, 'cause he isn't a missionary minister, you know, like—well, he isn't."

A faint color stole into Pollyanna's cheeks which was duplicated suddenly in those of her aunt.

"But she wears real pretty clothes, sometimes, in spite of their being so poor," resumed Pollyanna, in some haste. "And she's got perfectly beautiful rings with diamonds and rubies and emeralds in them; but she says she's got one ring too many, and that she's going to throw it away and get a divorce instead. What is a divorce, Aunt Polly? I'm afraid it isn't very nice, because she didn't look happy when she talked about it. And she said if she did get it, they wouldn't live there any more, and that Mr. Payson would go 'way off, and maybe the children, too. But I should think they'd rather keep the ring, even if they did have so many more. Shouldn't you? Aunt Polly, what is a divorce?"

"But they aren't going 'way off, dear," evaded Aunt Polly, hurriedly. "They're going to stay right there together."

"Oh, I'm so glad! Then they'll be there when I go up to see—O dear!" broke off the little girl, miserably. "Aunt Polly, why can't I remember that my legs don't go any more, and that I won't ever, ever go up to see Mr. Pendleton again?"

"There, there, don't," choked her aunt. "Perhaps you'll drive up sometime. But listen! I haven't told you, yet, all that Mrs. Payson said.She wanted me to tell you that they—they were going to stay together and to play the game, just as you wanted them to."

Pollyanna smiled through tear-wet eyes.

"Did they? Did they, really? Oh, I am glad of that!"

"Yes, she said she hoped you'd be. That's why she told you, to make you—glad, Pollyanna."

Pollyanna looked up quickly.

"Why, Aunt Polly, you—you spoke just as if you knew—do you know about the game, Aunt Polly?"

"Yes, dear." Miss Polly sternly forced her voice to be cheerfully matter-of-fact. "Nancy told me. I think it's a beautiful game. I'm going to play it now—with you."

"Oh, Aunt Polly—you? I'm so glad! You see, I've really wanted you most of anybody, all the time."

Aunt Polly caught her breath a little sharply. It was even harder this time to keep her voice steady; but she did it.

"Yes, dear, and there are all those others, too. Why, Pollyanna, I think all the town is playing that game now with you—even to the minister! I haven't had a chance to tell you, yet, but this morning I met Mr. Ford when I was down to the village, and he told me to say to you that just as soon as you could see him, he was coming to tell you that he hadn't stopped being glad over those eight hundred rejoicing texts that you told him about. So you see, dear, it's just you that have done it. The whole town is playing the game, and the whole town is wonderfully happier—and all because of one little girl who taught the people a new game, and how to play it."

Pollyanna clapped her hands.

"Oh, I'm so glad," she cried. Then, suddenly, a wonderful light illumined her face. "Why, Aunt Polly, there is something I can be glad about, after all. I can be glad I've had my legs, anyway—else I couldn't have done—that!"





Chapter XXIX. Through an Open Window


One by one the short winter days came and went—but they were not short to Pollyanna. They were long, and sometimes full of pain.Very resolutely, these days, however, Pollyanna was turning a cheerful face toward whatever came. Was she not specially bound to play the game, now that Aunt Polly was playing it, too? And Aunt Polly found so many things to be glad about! It was Aunt Polly, too, who discovered the story one day about the two poor little waifs in a snow-storm who found a blown-down door to crawl under, and who wondered what poor folks did that didn't have any door! And it was Aunt Polly who brought home the other story that she had heard about the poor old lady who had only two teeth, but who was so glad that those two teeth "hit"!

Pollyanna now, like Mrs. Snow, was knitting wonderful things out of bright colored worsteds that trailed their cheery lengths across the white spread, and made Pollyanna—again like Mrs. Snow—so glad she had her hands and arms, anyway.

Pollyanna saw people now, occasionally, and always there were the loving messages from those she could not see; and always they brought her something new to think about—and Pollyanna needed new things to think about.

Once she had seen John Pendleton, and twice she had seen Jimmy Bean. John Pendleton had told her what a fine boy Jimmy was getting to be, and how well he was doing. Jimmy had told her what a first-rate home he had, and what bang-up "folks" Mr. Pendleton made; and both had said that it was all owing to her.

"Which makes me all the gladder, you know, that I have had my legs," Pollyanna confided to her aunt afterwards.





The winter passed, and spring came. The anxious watchers over Pollyanna's condition could see little change wrought by the prescribed treatment. There seemed every reason to believe, indeed, that Dr.Mead's worst fears would be realized—that Pollyanna would never walk again.

Beldingsville, of course, kept itself informed concerning Pollyanna; and of Beldingsville, one man in particular fumed and fretted himself into a fever of anxiety over the daily bulletins which he managed in some way to procure from the bed of suffering. As the days passed, however, and the news came to be no better, but rather worse, something besides anxiety began to show in the man's face: despair, and a very dogged determination, each fighting for the mastery. In the end, the dogged determination won; and it was then that Mr. John Pendleton, somewhat to his surprise, received one Saturday morning a call from Dr. Thomas Chilton.

"Pendleton," began the doctor, abruptly, "I've come to you because you, better than any one else in town, know something of my relations with Miss Polly Harrington."

John Pendleton was conscious that he must have started visibly—he did know something of the affair between Polly Harrington and Thomas Chilton, but the matter had not been mentioned between them for fifteen years, or more.

"Yes," he said, trying to make his voice sound concerned enough for sympathy, and not eager enough for curiosity. In a moment he saw that he need not have worried, however: the doctor was quite too intent on his errand to notice how that errand was received.

"Pendleton, I want to see that child. I want to make an examination.I must make an examination."

"Well—can't you?"

"Can't I! Pendleton, you know very well I haven't been inside that door for more than fifteen years. You don't know—but I will tell you—that the mistress of that house told me that the next time she asked me to enter it, I might take it that she was begging my pardon, and that all would be as before—which meant that she'd marry me. Perhaps you see her summoning me now—but I don't!"

"But couldn't you go—without a summons?"

The doctor frowned.

"Well, hardly. I have some pride, you know."

"But if you're so anxious—couldn't you swallow your pride and forget the quarrel—"

"Forget the quarrel!" interrupted the doctor, savagely. "I'm not talking of that kind of pride. So far as that is concerned, I'd go from here there on my knees—or on my head—if that would do any good.It's professional pride I'm talking about. It's a case of sickness, and I'm a doctor. I can't butt in and say, 'Here, take me!' can I?"

"Chilton, what was the quarrel?" demanded Pendleton.

The doctor made an impatient gesture, and got to his feet.

"What was it? What's any lovers' quarrel after it's over?" he snarled, pacing the room angrily. "A silly wrangle over the size of the moon or the depth of a river, maybe—it might as well be, so far as its having any real significance compared to the years of misery that follow them! Never mind the quarrel! So far as I am concerned, I am willing to say there was no quarrel. Pendleton, I must see that child. It may mean life or death. It will mean—I honestly believe—nine chances out of ten that Pollyanna Whittier will walk again!"

The words were spoken clearly, impressively; and they were spoken just as the one who uttered them had almost reached the open window near John Pendleton's chair. Thus it happened that very distinctly they reached the ears of a small boy kneeling beneath the window on the ground outside.

Jimmy Bean, at his Saturday morning task of pulling up the first little green weeds of the flowerbeds, sat up with ears and eyes wide open.

"Walk! Pollyanna!" John Pendleton was saying. "What do you mean?"

"I mean that from what I can hear and learn—a mile from her bedside—that her case is very much like one that a college friend of mine has just helped. For years he's been making this sort of thing a special study. I've kept in touch with him, and studied, too, in a way.And from what I hear—but I want to see the girl!"

John Pendleton came erect in his chair.

"You must see her, man! Couldn't you—say, through Dr. Warren?"

The other shook his head.

"I'm afraid not. Warren has been very decent, though. He told me himself that he suggested consultation with me at the first, but—Miss Harrington said no so decisively that he didn't dare venture it again, even though he knew of my desire to see the child. Lately, some of his best patients have come over to me—so of course that ties my hands still more effectually. But, Pendleton, I've got to see that child! Think of what it may mean to her—if I do!"

"Yes, and think of what it will mean—if you don't!" retorted Pendleton.

"But how can I—without a direct request from her aunt?—which I'll never get!"

"She must be made to ask you!"

"How?"

"I don't know."

"No, I guess you don't—nor anybody else. She's too proud and too angry to ask me—after what she said years ago it would mean if she did ask me. But when I think of that child, doomed to lifelong misery, and when I think that maybe in my hands lies a chance of escape, but for that confounded nonsense we call pride and professional etiquette, I—" He did not finish his sentence, but with his hands thrust deep into his pockets, he turned and began to tramp up and down the room again, angrily.

"But if she could be made to see—to understand," urged John Pendleton.

"Yes, and who's going to do it?" demanded the doctor, with a savage turn.

"I don't know, I don't know," groaned the other, miserably.

Outside the window Jimmy Bean stirred suddenly. Up to now he had scarcely breathed, so intently had he listened to every word.

"Well, by Jinks, I know!" he whispered, exultingly. "I'm a-goin'ter do it!" And forthwith he rose to his feet, crept stealthily around the corner of the house, and ran with all his might down Pendleton Hill.





Chapter XXX. Jimmy Takes the Helm


"It's Jimmy Bean. He wants ter see ye, ma'am," announced Nancy in the doorway.

"Me?" rejoined Miss Polly, plainly surprised. "Are you sure he did not mean Miss Pollyanna? He may see her a few minutes to-day, if he likes."

"Yes'm. I told him. But he said it was you he wanted."

"Very well, I'll come down." And Miss Polly arose from her chair a little wearily.

In the sitting room she found waiting for her a round-eyed, flushed-faced boy, who began to speak at once.

"Ma'am, I s'pose it's dreadful—what I'm doin', an' what I'm sayin'; but I can't help it. It's for Pollyanna, and I'd walk over hot coals for her, or face you, or—or anythin' like that, any time. An' I think you would, too, if you thought there was a chance for her ter walk again.An' so that's why I come ter tell ye that as long as it's only pride an'et—et-somethin' that's keepin' Pollyanna from walkin', why I knew you would ask Dr. Chilton here if you understood—"

"Wh-at?" interrupted Miss Polly, the look of stupefaction on her face changing to one of angry indignation.

Jimmy sighed despairingly.

"There, I didn't mean ter make ye mad. That's why I begun by tellin' ye about her walkin' again. I thought you'd listen ter that."

"Jimmy, what are you talking about?"

Jimmy sighed again.

"That's what I'm tryin' ter tell ye."

"Well, then tell me. But begin at the beginning, and be sure I understand each thing as you go. Don't plunge into the middle of it as you did before—and mix everything all up!"

Jimmy wet his lips determinedly.

"Well, ter begin with, Dr. Chilton come ter see Mr. Pendleton, an'they talked in the library. Do you understand that?"

"Yes, Jimmy." Miss Polly's voice was rather faint.

"Well, the window was open, and I was weedin' the flower-bed under it; an' I heard 'em talk."

"Oh, Jimmy! Listening?"

"'Twa'n't about me, an' 'twa'n't sneak listenin'," bridled Jimmy. "And I'm glad I listened. You will be when I tell ye. Why, it may make Pollyanna—walk!"

"Jimmy, what do you mean?" Miss Polly was leaning forward eagerly.

"There, I told ye so," nodded Jimmy, contentedly. "Well, Dr.Chilton knows some doctor somewhere that can cure Pollyanna, he thinks—make her walk, ye know; but he can't tell sure till he sees her.And he wants ter see her somethin' awful, but he told Mr. Pendleton that you wouldn't let him."

Miss Polly's face turned very red.

"But, Jimmy, I—I can't—I couldn't! That is, I didn't know!" Miss Polly was twisting her fingers together helplessly.

"Yes, an' that's what I come ter tell ye, so you would know," asserted Jimmy, eagerly. "They said that for some reason—I didn't rightly catch what—you wouldn't let Dr. Chilton come, an' you told Dr.Warren so; an' Dr. Chilton couldn't come himself, without you asked him, on account of pride an' professional et—et—well, et-somethin' anyway. An' they was wishin' somebody could make you understand, only they didn't know who could; an' I was outside the winder, an' I says ter myself right away, 'By Jinks, I'll do it!' An' I come—an' have I made ye understand?"

"Yes; but, Jimmy, about that doctor," implored Miss Polly, feverishly. "Who was he? What did he do? Are they sure he could make Pollyanna walk?"

"I don't know who he was. They didn't say. Dr. Chilton knows him, an' he's just cured somebody just like her, Dr. Chilton thinks.Anyhow, they didn't seem ter be doin' no worryin' about him. 'Twas you they was worryin' about, 'cause you wouldn't let Dr. Chilton see her. An' say—you will let him come, won't you?—now you understand?"

Miss Polly turned her head from side to side. Her breath was coming in little uneven, rapid gasps. Jimmy, watching her with anxious eyes, thought she was going to cry. But she did not cry. After a minute she said brokenly:

"Yes—I'll let—Dr. Chilton—see her. Now run home, Jimmy—quick! I've got to speak to Dr. Warren. He's up-stairs now. I saw him drive in a few minutes ago."

A little later Dr. Warren was surprised to meet an agitated, flushed-faced Miss Polly in the hall. He was still more surprised to hear the lady say, a little breathlessly:

"Dr. Warren, you asked me once to allow Dr. Chilton to be called in consultation, and—I refused. Since then I have reconsidered. I very much desire that you should call in Dr. Chilton. Will you not ask him at once—please? Thank you."





Chapter XXXI. A New Uncle


The next time Dr. Warren entered the chamber where Pollyanna lay watching the dancing shimmer of color on the ceiling, a tall, broad-shouldered man followed close behind him.

"Dr. Chilton!—oh, Dr. Chilton, how glad I am to see you!" cried Pollyanna. And at the joyous rapture of the voice, more than one pair of eyes in the room brimmed hot with sudden tears. "But, of course, if Aunt Polly doesn't want—"

"It is all right, my dear; don't worry," soothed Miss Polly, agitatedly, hurrying forward. "I have told Dr. Chilton that—that I want him to look you over—with Dr. Warren, this morning."

"Oh, then you asked him to come," murmured Pollyanna, contentedly.

"Yes, dear, I asked him. That is—" But it was too late. The adoring happiness that had leaped to Dr. Chilton's eyes was unmistakable and Miss Polly had seen it. With very pink cheeks she turned and left the room hurriedly.

Over in the window the nurse and Dr. Warren were talking earnestly. Dr. Chilton held out both his hands to Pollyanna.

"Little girl, I'm thinking that one of the very gladdest jobs you ever did has been done to-day," he said in a voice shaken with emotion.

At twilight a wonderfully tremulous, wonderfully different Aunt Polly crept to Pollyanna's bedside. The nurse was at supper. They had the room to themselves.

"Pollyanna, dear, I'm going to tell you—the very first one of all.Some day I'm going to give Dr. Chilton to you for your—uncle. And it's you that have done it all. Oh, Pollyanna, I'm so—happy! And so—glad!—darling!"

Pollyanna began to clap her hands; but even as she brought her small palms together the first time, she stopped, and held them suspended.

"Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, were you the woman's hand and heart he wanted so long ago? You were—I know you were! And that's what he meant by saying I'd done the gladdest job of all—to-day. I'm so glad!Why, Aunt Polly, I don't know but I'm so glad that I don't mind—even my legs, now!"

Aunt Polly swallowed a sob.

"Perhaps, some day, dear—" But Aunt Polly did not finish. Aunt Polly did not dare to tell, yet, the great hope that Dr. Chilton had put into her heart. But she did say this—and surely this was quite wonderful enough—to Pollyanna's mind:

"Pollyanna, next week you're going to take a journey. On a nice comfortable little bed you're going to be carried in cars and carriages to a great doctor, who has a big house many miles from here made on purpose for just such people as you are. He's a dear friend of Dr.Chilton's, and we're going to see what he can do for you!"





Chapter XXXII. Which is a Letter From Pollyanna


Dear Aunt Polly and Uncle Tom,

Oh, I can—I can—I can walk! I did to-day all the way from my bed to the window! It was six steps. My, how good it was to be on legs again!

All the doctors stood around and smiled, and all the nurses stood beside of them and cried. A lady in the next ward who walked last week first, peeked into the door, and another one who hopes she can walk next month, was invited in to the party, and she laid on my nurse's bed and clapped her hands. Even Black Tilly who washes the floor, looked through the piazza window and called me 'Honey, child'when she wasn't crying too much to call me anything.

I don't see why they cried. I wanted to sing and shout and yell!Oh—oh—oh! just think, I can walk—walk—walk! Now I don't mind being here almost ten months, and I didn't miss the wedding, anyhow.Wasn't that just like you, Aunt Polly, to come on here and get married right beside my bed, so I could see you. You always do think of the gladdest things!

Pretty soon, they say, I shall go home. I wish I could walk all the way there. I do. I don't think I shall ever want to ride anywhere any more.It will be so good just to walk. Oh, I'm so glad! I'm glad for everything.Why, I'm glad now I lost my legs for a while, for you never, never know how perfectly lovely legs are till you haven't got them—that go, I mean.I'm going to walk eight steps to-morrow.

With heaps of love to everybody,

Pollyanna
