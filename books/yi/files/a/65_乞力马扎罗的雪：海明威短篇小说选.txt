译序


国人崇拜海明威（哪能不崇拜呢？），因为他影响了我们的生活态度，影响了我们的文风。他是个叫人热血沸腾的钢铁汉子，敢于为正义的事业赴汤蹈火。1937年至1938年，他以战地记者的身份奔波于西班牙内战前线。在第二次世界大战期间，他作为记者随军行动，并参加了解放巴黎的战斗。1941年底太平洋战争爆发后，海明威立即将自己的游艇改装成巡艇，侦察德国潜艇的行动，为消灭敌人提供情报。1942年，德国潜艇击沉了多艘美国运货船。美国海军还未从珍珠港大战的巨大损失中恢复过来，所以不得不让一些民间志愿者开着他们自己的私人游艇去巡逻海岸。这些志愿者被称为“烂污海军”。他们只是进行简单的巡逻，然后通过无线电将海下的情况报告给岸上的军方。海明威以船长自称，开始在古巴海岸巡逻，一心希望看到一艘德国潜艇，然后用汤普森机枪和手榴弹将其击沉。他召集了一群“杂牌军”，其中包括巴斯克回力球球员和百万富翁等。诺曼底登陆海明威也参加了，但军方认为他这个大人物不能受一丝一毫的损失，所以只允许他待在船上。他们很快就明白海明威可不是一个愿意接受照顾或是听从命令的人。在跟随第二十二军团行进过程中，海明威得到军方批准，可在朗布依埃小镇开展情报搜集工作。很快，他便成了一支游击队的头头，他的部下有一个特工、几个法国士兵和几个普通平民，这些人对他唯命是从，恭敬地称呼他为“爸爸”、“上尉”，甚至是“伟大的上尉”。在人们眼中，这支非正规军就是一帮狂热崇拜海明威的匪徒，他们甚至模仿海明威的言谈举止和行事风格。随着越来越多平民与法国士兵的加入，海明威的这支非正规军逐渐扩大至几百人。海明威甚至穿着陆军上校的制服，带领他们多次加入战斗。战争结束两年之际，他被授予一枚铜质奖章。

海明威喜欢这种正义的“血性”，也喜欢“原始性”，他对非洲有着剪不断理还乱的情结。他曾经随狩猎队去非洲，经历了许多惊心动魄的“原始”场面，并进行了生动的描述，本书里的《弗朗西斯·麦康伯短暂、幸福的人生经历》、《乞力马扎罗的雪》和《一段非洲的往事》记载了他当时的见闻和见解。在《一段非洲的往事》里，从一个小男孩戴维的角度出发，海明威表现出对于人类与自然关系的强烈关注，揭示了人类残忍的本性，表达了创造人类与自然和谐关系的美好愿望。小说中的大公象是坚强不屈的人的象征体。这样的形象和海明威在名著《老人与海》中塑造的那个与鲨鱼搏斗的老人，在许多地方是相通的。

海明威虽然作品并不多，但他的小说思想性强，令人回味无穷，赢得了成千上万的读者。美国著名史学家威勒德·索普曾在《二十世纪美国文学》中写道：“尽管海明威的小说要隔很长时间才出版一本，但是在一本新小说出版之前几个月就已经引起了人们的争论，并且这种争论在小说出版后几个月还在继续进行。”海明威的作品大受欢迎，还有一个原因，就是其中充溢着美国人所喜欢的“阳刚之气”。正如我国学者于冬云在评论文章中所言：“所谓海明威的文体风格，即赫·欧·贝茨所称道的简洁、干净、含蓄、凝练。这是一种‘绝不矫饰’、‘平易粗放、街头硬汉般的文风’，他尤其擅长用‘那种公牛般的、出于本能的、缺少思想的语言’来陈述他故事中的那些猎人、渔夫、斗牛士、士兵、拳击者的思想和行为。福柯认为，影响和控制语言运动的最根本因素是权力。现代社会语言学也发现男性语体是一种有力的语体，女性语体则是一种无力的语体。以此标准来重新审视贝茨一再称颂的海明威的文体风格，便不难发现在这种简洁粗硬的文风下掩盖的男性权力的特征。从早期创作开始，海明威就有意识地选择了这样一种叙事文体，并坚持使用了一生。因此，我们完全有理由说海明威的叙事文体是一种典型的男性话语方式。”

这样的一种文体对欧美大陆当时流行的冗长、繁杂的文风简直就是叛逆和颠覆，在一些大牌评论家的吹捧之下立时犹如一阵狂风席卷大地，引起了一场“文学革命”，在许多欧美作家的身上留下了深深的痕印。海明威所尊奉的是美国建筑师罗德维希的名言“越少，就越多”，使作品趋于精练，缩短了作品与读者之间的距离，提出了“冰山原则”，只表现事物的八分之一，使作品充实、含蓄、耐人寻味。海明威写作态度极为严肃，十分重视作品的修改。据说他每天开始写作时，先把前一天写的文稿读一遍，写到哪里就改到哪里。全书写完后又从头到尾改一遍，草稿请人誊清后又改一遍，最后清样出来再改一遍。他认为这样三次大修改是写好一本书的必要条件。他主张“去掉废话”，在修改时把一切华而不实的词句删去，每一句、每一段落都达到“精益求精”。还有人说，由于在第一次世界大战中膝盖被子弹打碎，海明威必须站着写作，久而久之形成了“永远站着”的“强硬”风格，字句也异常简练。自杀前他留下遗言，要人在他的墓碑上刻下“恕我再也不能站起来了”。不管原因如何，反正他惜墨如金，字字句句都是详细推敲的结晶。虽然没有开创一个新的文学流派，他却是开了一代文风的语言艺术大师。

海明威的作品可谓字字珠玑，读者从中吮吸营养，大快朵颐。其中最广为人知的有《第五纵队》、《丧钟为谁而鸣》、《老人与海》、《太阳照常升起》、《永别了，武器》、《乞力马扎罗的雪》等。1954年，海明威荣获诺贝尔文学奖。获奖后的海明威患有多种疾病，给他的身心造成了极大的痛苦，没能再创作出很有影响力的作品，这使他精神抑郁，形成了消极悲观的情绪。1961年7月2日，蜚声世界文坛的海明威用自己的猎枪结束了他的生命。整个世界都为之震惊，人们纷纷叹息这位巨人的悲剧。美国人民更是悲悼这颗美国文坛巨星的陨落。在这个总统死了都不会哀痛的国家，海明威何以能令举国上下“沉浸在哀痛之中”？就凭他独特的作品，就凭他那硬汉精神！海明威本人及其笔下的人物影响了整整一代甚至几代美国人，人们纷纷仿效他和他作品中的人物。他就是美国精神的化身。人们在为这种精神哭泣。

海明威的作品难以翻译，因为他的语言过于“含蓄”和“简练”——阅读原文尚可以“咀嚼”出其中所包含的“精神”，但翻译成其他语言，难免会“缺斤少两”。如此，便不能一味地“直译”，需用艺术的“再创造”方法辅以“意译”——其目的是为了不“失真”，让读者通过译文了解“海明威精神”，了解那动人魂魄的故事情节。有人说海明威作品中的词句过于“刚硬”，而“刚硬”则易折，即破碎成许许多多的“节”。翻译时应该掌握好“火候”，既要还原其“硬汉风格”，还要让读者看到一个完整的海明威。译者已“绞尽脑汁”，但愿不“亵渎”海明威，不辜负读者热切的希望！

弗朗西斯·麦康伯短暂、幸福的人生经历


午饭时间，大家来到帐篷餐厅，坐在双层的绿色篷顶下，好像什么事情也没有发生过似的。

“你们喝酸橙汁还是柠檬汽水？”麦康伯问。

“给我来一杯伏特加杜松子鸡尾酒吧。”罗伯特·威尔逊回话说。

“我也要一杯伏特加杜松子鸡尾酒。我需要喝一杯酒。”麦康伯的妻子说。

“我想是该喝杯酒的。”麦康伯同意妻子的说法，“那就叫他调三杯吧。”

说话间，杂役从帆布冷藏袋里取出几瓶酒，已经在调制了。帐篷遮蔽在林间，一阵风穿过树林吹来，使酒瓶上凝结出一层水珠。

“应该给他们多少钱？”麦康伯问。

“一英镑就不少了，”威尔逊说，“可别把他们给惯坏了。”

“他们的头头会把钱分下去吧？”

“当然会的。”

半个小时前，弗朗西斯·麦康伯得意扬扬地被厨子、贴身杂役、剥皮工(1)以及脚夫用胳膊抬、用肩扛，从营地的边缘送到了他的帐篷。这次游行，扛枪的杂役没有参加。那些土著人把他送到帐篷前，将他放下，接着他跟大伙儿一一握手，接受他们的祝贺。之后，他进入帐篷坐在床上，直至他的妻子走了进来。妻子进来，却没有和他说话。他起身离开了帐篷，在外边的便携式盥洗盆里洗了把脸和手，随即便去了餐厅帐篷，在一把舒适的帆布椅子上落座，于林荫之中吹着习习的微风。

“你算是猎到了狮子，”罗伯特·威尔逊对他说道，“而且是一头非常棒的狮子哩。”

麦康伯夫人飞快地瞥了威尔逊一眼。她有着沉鱼落雁的容貌，而且保养得很好。五年前，凭着姿色和社会地位，她拿几张照片为一款自己从未用过的美容产品做广告，获得了五千块钱的酬金。她嫁给弗朗西斯·麦康伯已经有十一个年头了。

“那头狮子很不错，是不是？”麦康伯说。此时，他的妻子正看着他。麦康伯夫人打量着眼前的这两个男人，那样子好像是以前从来没见过他们似的。

这个威尔逊，是位白人猎手，她觉得自己以前从未仔细看过他。他看上去中等身材，沙色头发，胡子拉碴，一张通红的脸，蓝眼睛冰冷冷的，眼角罩着细细的白色皱纹，一笑那皱纹便成了一道道深沟。此时，他正冲着她笑哩。她将目光从他的脸上移开，看他那穿着宽松束腰外衣的溜肩膀——外衣上原该有个左胸兜的，却被几个环套所取代，环套里有四个大弹药夹。接着，她便看他那棕褐色的大手、旧旧的宽松长裤以及脏兮兮的靴子，最后又将目光收回来看他的红脸。她注意到那张被阳光烤红的脸上有一圈白线，那是戴斯泰森毡帽留下的印迹（此时，那顶毡帽挂在帐篷支柱的钉子上）。

“好，咱们为那头狮子干杯。”罗伯特·威尔逊说，他又冲着她笑了笑。而对方没有笑，却在看她的丈夫，眼神有些古怪。

弗朗西斯·麦康伯个子特别高，如果不计较骨骼的长短，身材算是非常匀称的了，黑黑的肤色，寸头，头发剪得很短，像个桨手，两片嘴唇薄薄的，可以说是一表人才。他和威尔逊一样，穿的都是狩猎队的服装，只不过他的衣服簇新。他今年三十五岁，身体相当强健，擅长球类运动，钓过许多大鱼，而刚才却当着众人的面暴露出自己是个胆小鬼。

“为那头狮子干杯。”他说道，“对于你的付出，我感激不尽。”

他的妻子玛格丽特把目光从他的身上移开，又转向了威尔逊。

“那头狮子咱们就不谈了。”她说道。

威尔逊看了看她，这次没笑，而她却冲他笑了笑。

“这是一个非常奇怪的日子，”她说道，“中午即便在帐篷里，是不是也该把帽子戴上？这可是你告诉我的。”

“戴倒是可以戴的。”威尔逊说。

“要知道，你有一张非常红的脸，威尔逊先生。”她说完，又嫣然一笑。

“喝酒喝的。”威尔逊说。

“恐怕不是的。”她说，“弗朗西斯也经常手不离杯，但他的脸从来就没有红过。”

“今天红了呀。”麦康伯想开个玩笑，于是这样说道。

“不对，”玛格丽特说，“今天红脸的是我。要说威尔逊先生，他的脸历来都是红的。”

“这八成是人种的关系吧。”威尔逊说，“喂，你不会再想拿我英俊的外表做话题吧？”

“我这只是开了个头。”

“这个咱们就不谈了。”威尔逊说。

“大家谈谈话怎么就这么难。”玛格丽特说。

“别说傻话，玛戈(2)。”她丈夫说。

“没什么难的，”威尔逊说，“打到了一头非常棒的狮子呀。”

玛格丽特扫了他们俩一眼，两人看得出她都快要哭了。威尔逊老早就注意到了，这让他感到担心。麦康伯倒是坦然，已经并不为之感到担心了。

“真希望这件事就没有发生过。唉，真希望这件事就没有发生过。”她边说边到自己的帐篷去了。她没有哭出声，但他们看到她那裹在玫瑰色防晒衬衣中的肩膀在抖动。

“女人动不动就伤感。”威尔逊对那位高个子丈夫说，“不会出什么事的。只是精神紧张，接触到的事情多了些罢了。”

“没什么，”麦康伯说，“我想我的后半生都得忍耐了。”

“胡说什么呀。来，为精彩的猎杀干杯。”威尔逊说，“该忘的就忘掉它，没什么可遗憾的。”

“试试吧。”麦康伯说，“不过，对于你的帮助，我是不会忘的。”

“没什么，”威尔逊说，“都是不着边的话。”

两人坐在树荫里说着话。他们的营地设在几棵浓荫似盖的洋槐树下，背后是巨石高耸的悬崖，前面有一片草地一直延伸向一条小溪边，溪水里净是石头，过了小溪就是森林。杂役摆饭桌的时候，他们喝着刚冰镇好的酸橙汁，尽量不去看对方的眼睛。威尔逊看得出，杂役们全都知道实情了。麦康伯的贴身杂役一边把饭菜摆上饭桌，一边用异样的目光打量着自己的主人。威尔逊见状，用斯瓦希里语呵斥了一声。那杂役一脸的茫然，转身走了。

“你对他说了什么？”麦康伯问。

“没什么。只是让他识相些，不然就没他好果子吃，给他狠狠来上十五下。”

“十五下什么？鞭打吗？”

“鞭打完全是非法的。”威尔逊说，“仅仅允许扣他们的工钱。”

“你是不是还用鞭打惩罚他们？”

“哦，是的。假如他们选择去告状，很可能会祸起萧墙。可是，他们不会告我的，情愿挨鞭子，也不愿被扣工钱。”

“真是咄咄怪事！”麦康伯说。

“其实没什么奇怪的。”威尔逊说，“你会怎么做？是愿意被桦条狠狠抽打一顿，还是拿不到工钱？”

话刚一出口，他就感到挺难为情的，于是没等麦康伯回话，又急忙说：“要知道，每一天每一日人人都在挨鞭子，不是这种鞭子，就是那种鞭子。”

这话也没让情况好到哪儿去。他心想：“上帝呀，我都成了个玩外交辞令的人了！”

“不错，是都在挨鞭子。”麦康伯说，眼睛仍然没有朝着他看，“对于猎狮子这件事，我感到十分遗憾。这件事到此为止，不应该再张扬了吧？我的意思是不让他们任何人知道此事，好吗？”

“你是说我会在马赛卡俱乐部谈起此事？”威尔逊冷冷地望着他。真没想到对方会如此猜忌人。他心中暗想，麦康伯不仅是个可恶的懦夫，还是个该死的下流种。在这之前，他竟然还十分喜欢麦康伯哩。美国人真是叫人捉摸不透呀！

“不会的。”威尔逊说，“我是个职业猎手。对于主顾，我们是闭口不谈的。你尽管放心好啦。不过，听到别人提出要求，叫我们闭嘴，挺不是滋味的。”

他决定就此来个了断，那样处境会容易得多。他照样吃饭（独自一人吃饭），可以边吃饭边看书。让那两口子吃他们自己的。他会公事公办，照样陪他们把打猎进行到底。法国人把这叫什么来着？体面的尊重！那样一来，比这样陷于情感旋涡里利落得多。他将羞辱羞辱对方，给他来个一刀两断。那时，他可以吃吃东西、看看书，而对方的威士忌他照喝不误。打猎时出现不愉快的情况，一般都说这种话。遇见一位白人猎手，你问他：“情况怎么样呀？”如果他说“他们的威士忌我照喝不误”，那你就知道情况糟透了。

“对不起。”麦康伯说，一边抬起他那张美国脸望着他——那张脸就是到了中年也会青春焕发。威尔逊注意到他留着桨手那样的寸头，一双眼睛漂漂亮亮（只是目光有些躲闪），端正的鼻子，薄嘴唇，下巴很好看。“对不起，我没料到会出现这种情况。有许多规矩我都是不知道的。”

威尔逊心里真不知怎么才好了。他已经决定跟对方彻底翻脸了，可是这个不要脸的家伙刚刚侮辱了他，现在又向他表示歉意了。他只好再做做尝试，把关系缓一缓。“别担心我会张扬此事，”他说道，“我得有碗饭吃呀。要知道，在非洲，就是女人也能猎杀狮子，没有一个白人会见了狮子就跑。”

“我是跑了，像只兔子撒腿就跑。”麦康伯说。

威尔逊心里没了谱，遇到这么一个会说软话的家伙，真不知该怎么应付了。

威尔逊用他的那双机枪手的坚毅的蓝眼睛看了看麦康伯，而对方冲他莞尔一笑。假如你注意不到他自尊心受损时所表现出来的眼神，可以说他的微笑令人心情愉悦。

“也许打野牛时，我可以做一弥补。”他说，“接下来就要去打野牛了，对不对？”

“如果你愿意，咱们明天早晨去。”威尔逊说道。也许，他刚才的想法是错的。这样想的确是个应付局面的方法。对于美国人，你是捉摸不透的，不知道会出现什么现象。此刻，他的天平又倒向了麦康伯。今天早晨的事能忘就忘了吧。可是，那样的事是想忘也忘不了的。今天早晨简直倒了血霉。

“哦，太太来了！”他说道。只见玛格丽特袅袅婷婷从她的帐篷走了过来，显得精神焕发、情绪高涨，可爱极了。她有一张无可挑剔的鹅蛋脸，简直完美极了，叫你甚至会以为她是个头脑愚蠢的花瓶。不过，威尔逊觉得她不蠢，一点也不蠢。

“怎么样，英俊的大红脸威尔逊先生？我的宝贝弗朗西斯，感觉好些了吧？”

“哦，感觉好多了。”麦康伯说。

“这件事我全都想透了。”她边说边在桌旁坐了下来，“弗朗西斯是不是擅长于猎狮，那又有多大关系呢？他又不是吃这碗饭的。那是威尔逊先生的行当。在打猎方面，威尔逊先生的确是得心应手。你是什么样的动物都猎杀，对不对？”

“哦，是什么样的猎物都行。”威尔逊说，“什么样的动物都猎杀。”他心里在想，这种女人是天下最强硬、最无情、最具掠夺性，也是最富于魅力的女人；随着她们强硬起来，她们的丈夫就会变成脓包，或者被折磨得发疯。难道她们在选择丈夫时，专拣软柿子捏？可是，结婚时年轻，不会这么有心计呀！值得庆幸的是，他已经完成了关于美国女人方面的教育，意识到眼前的这个是极具吸引力的女人。

“我们明天早晨去打野牛。”他对她说道。

“我也去。”她说。

“不行，你不能去。”

“行的，我能去。弗朗西斯，你说呢？”

“留在营地里不好吗？”

“那是绝对不行的。”她说，“像今天的这种场面，我是绝对不愿错过的。”

威尔逊心想，她刚才走开，躲到一边去哭的时候，看上去女人味十足，像是懂事、体贴，为丈夫以及自己感到痛心，是个通情达理的人，二十分钟后返回就变了样，又涂抹上了一层美国女人的那种狠心肠的彩釉。这种女人真是可怕，简直太可怕了。

“明天我们为你再来一场表演。”弗朗西斯·麦康伯说。

“你还是不要去了。”威尔逊说。

“你这样阻拦是不对的。”她说道，“我还想再看你表演一次呢。你今天早晨的表演很精彩哟。如果说把野兽的脑袋打得稀巴烂也可以算是精彩的话。”

“该吃饭了。”威尔逊说，“你挺高兴的，是不是？”

“为什么不呢？我来这儿又不是找烦恼的。”

“哦，没什么可烦恼的。”威尔逊说。放眼望去，他可以看得到河水里的大石头以及树影婆娑的高高的河岸。看着看着，他又想起了今天早晨的事情。

“是啊，没什么可烦恼的。”她说，“一切都很好。明天也是个好日子。对于明天，你都不知道我是怎样期盼呢。”

“这道菜是大羚羊肉。”威尔逊说。

“大羚羊的个头像牛一样，跑起来像野兔，对不对？”

“我觉得你描绘得很生动。”威尔逊说。

“大羚羊的肉是很好吃的。”麦康伯说。

“羚羊是你打到的吧，弗朗西斯？”她问。

“是的。”

“这种动物不危险吧？”

“只要别让它们扑到你身上就行。”威尔逊说。

“真叫人高兴。”

“能不能收敛一些，别轻飘飘的，玛戈。”麦康伯说，一边从大羚羊肉排上切下一片来，用叉子朝下将肉叉住，往上涂抹土豆泥、肉汁以及胡萝卜丁。

“既然你把话说得这么漂亮，我想我是可以做得到的。”她说。

“今晚喝上一杯，为那头狮子干杯。”威尔逊说，“中午的天气有点太热。”

“啊，那头狮子，”玛格丽特说，“你不提我都忘了！”

罗伯特·威尔逊觉得她话里夹枪带棒。或者说她这是在演戏给人看。当一个女人发现自己的丈夫是个可恶的懦夫时，你说她会怎么样呢？这娘们真够狠心的。不过，女人不是都狠心么？当然，为了掌握控制权，有时候就得狠心。话虽这么说，狠毒心肠还是叫人受不了的。

“再吃点羚羊肉！”他客客气气地对她说。

当天下午晚一些的时候，威尔逊和麦康伯乘车出去了。同行的有土著汽车司机以及两个扛枪的人。麦康伯夫人留在了营地里，因为天气太热，她出不了门。她说明天一大早随他们出行。汽车启动时，威尔逊看见她站在那棵大树下，身穿她的那件淡淡的玫瑰色卡其布衫，虽然不是天姿国色，却也妩媚动人，一头乌丝从脑门朝后梳，绾成一个髻，低垂在脖后，脸蛋水灵灵的，就像身处英国一样。她频频招手送别。汽车开过长满高高荒草的洼地，穿过一片树林拐了个弯，驶入遍布果子灌木丛的山丘间。

他们发现果子灌木丛里有一群黑斑羚，于是便下了车，悄悄向一只年老的公羚摸了过去——那只公羚有一对长角，向两边分得开开的。麦康伯开了一枪，射杀了它。中间隔着足足有两百码的距离，这一枪真是值得称赞。羚羊群吓得仓皇奔逃，一蹿一跃的，将长长的腿收起，你从我的背上跳过去，我从你的背上跃过去，像是飘在空中一样，似梦里的场景，令人难以相信。

“这一枪打得漂亮。”威尔逊说，“黑斑羚目标小，难打中的。”

“黑斑羚的脑袋值得一要吗？(3)”麦康伯问。

“它的脑袋棒极啦。”威尔逊说，“你这样打枪，就不会有什么问题了。”

“你觉得明天能找到野牛吗？”

“概率是很大的。它们一大清早出来吃草，运气好就能在野外看到它们。”

“我想借此机会将猎狮的那件事一笔抹掉。”麦康伯说，“出了这样的事情，让妻子看见了总是不太好的。”

威尔逊心想，更不好的是你自己做了这样的事情，别管妻子计较不计较，而且还把此事挂在嘴边提来提去。他是这么想的，但口中却说：“要是我，就不多想此事了。头一次猎狮，换上谁都会心慌的。过去的就让它过去吧。”

可是晚上吃过饭之后，上床前喝了杯威士忌加苏打水，弗朗西斯·麦康伯躺在罩着蚊帐的小床上，细听着夜色里的响动，这件事仍没有过去。它既没有过去，也不是刚开始，而是已经发生，历历在目，有些细节不可磨灭，尤为清晰，让他痛苦和害臊。比害臊更可怕的是，他内心感到寒冷而空洞的恐惧。恐惧感仍折磨着他，像一个冷冰冰、黏糊糊的黑窟窿，在他空荡荡的内心里占据了原来属于自信心的位置，这叫他感到难过。这件事让他难以忘怀。

此事是在昨天夜里开始的。当时他被惊醒，听见河的上游传来狮子吼声，声音低沉，吼完一声，还呼噜呼噜咳嗽几下，听上去就好像在帐篷外似的。弗朗西斯·麦康伯半夜醒来听到的就是这声音，这叫他感到害怕。他可以听见妻子已熟睡，发出均匀的呼吸声。没有人听他诉说心里的恐惧，也没有人跟他一起害怕。他孤孤单单一个人躺在那里。他并不知道索马里有条谚语，说勇敢的人总会被狮子吓上三次：一是发现狮子足印的时候，二是听见狮吼，三是跟狮子照面的时候。黎明时分，太阳升起之前，他们借着马灯的光亮在餐厅帐篷里吃早饭，又听见了那只狮子的吼叫声。弗朗西斯觉得它就在营地的边上。

“听声音像是只老狮子。”正在吃熏鱼、喝咖啡的罗伯特·威尔逊抬起头说，“听它的咳嗽就知道了。”

“它是不是离得很近？”

“在河上游，大概有一英里吧。”

“需要去看看吗？”

“会去看的。”

“它的叫声能传这么远吗？听上去就好像在营地里似的。”

“传得远得很呢。”罗伯特·威尔逊说，“传得这么远，的确挺奇怪的。但愿是只可以猎杀的大猫。杂役们说这一带的确有一只个头非常大的家伙。”

“假如开枪，应该打它的哪个地方才能把它撂倒？”麦康伯问。

“打两个膀子的中间。”威尔逊说，“假如办得到，就打它的脖子。瞄准骨头打，一枪放翻。”

“但愿能打得准。”麦康伯说。

“你的枪法是很好的。”威尔逊说，“沉住气，瞄准再开枪。头一枪就打中是至关紧要的。”

“开枪的距离呢？”

“很难说。这得看狮子的情况而定了。应该近一些，能够一枪射中，否则别开枪。”

“在一百码以内可以吧？”麦康伯问。

威尔逊飞快地瞥了他一眼。

“一百码是差不多的。也许要在一百码之内开枪射击。千万别远在一百码之外就莽撞射击。一百码是个很好的距离，想打哪个位置就打哪个位置。瞧，太太来啦。”

“早晨好！”玛格丽特说道，“今天咱们去找那头狮子吗？”

“你把早饭吃完就出发。”威尔逊说，“感觉怎么样？”

“非常好。”她说，“我激动得不得了。”

“我去看看，把准备工作做好。”威尔逊说完起身要走。就在这时，那只狮子又吼了一声。

“这个大叫大嚷的讨厌家伙，”威尔逊说，“会让它叫不出声的。”

“你怎么啦，弗朗西斯？”妻子问。

“没什么。”麦康伯说。

“是有原因的。”她说，“什么事情叫你如坐针毡似的？”

“什么事也没有。”他说。

“告诉我实情，”她盯住他说，“你感觉不舒服？”

“是被可恶的狮子吼吵着了。”他说，“要知道，它吼了整整一夜。”

“你为什么不把我叫醒。”她说，“我倒是喜欢听狮子吼叫。”

“我得杀了那讨厌的家伙。”麦康伯阴沉着脸说。

“哦，你到这儿来，不就是为了猎杀狮子吗？”

“是的。不过，有点紧张。一听见那畜生吼叫，我就神经紧张。”

“那好，那就按威尔逊说的，去杀掉它，让它再也叫不出声来。”

“好的，亲爱的。”弗朗西斯·麦康伯说，“听上去怪容易的，是不是？”

“你不害怕吧？”

“当然不害怕。不过，听它吼了一夜，精神倒是有些紧张。”

“你会很漂亮地将它干掉的。”她说，“我知道你一定能。我真是渴望看到那场面哩。”

“把你的饭吃完，咱们这就出发。”

“天还没亮呢。”她说，“这个时刻不尴不尬的。”

就在这时，那头狮子从胸腔的深处发出一声呻吟，那声音突然变为喉音，继而调门升高，成为颤音，似乎连空气都随之颤抖。最后，那声音化为一声叹息和一种发自胸腔深处的呼噜声。

“听那声音，好像近在咫尺。”麦康伯的妻子说。

“天呀，”麦康伯说，“我讨厌那可恶的声音。”

“让人听了印象非常深刻。”

“还说印象深刻。简直是可怕！”

这时，罗伯特·威尔逊走了过来，手里拎着他那支又短又难看、口径大得惊人的.505吉布斯猎枪，嘴角挂着微笑。

“走吧。”他说道，“你的扛枪手把你的斯普林菲尔德步枪以及那支大枪都带上了。东西都装上车了。你有实心弹吗？”

“有。”

“我准备好了。”麦康伯夫人说。

“这次务必让它叫不出声来。”威尔逊说，“你坐前排，太太和我可以坐在后排。”

大家伙都上了汽车，在灰蒙蒙的第一缕曙光中驱车穿过树林，向河的上游驶去。麦康伯打开步枪的后膛，看见里面装了金属壳的子弹，便合上膛门，推上了保险栓。他看到自己的手在哆嗦。他把手伸进衣袋去摸了摸子弹夹，然后又用手摸上衣胸前环套里的弹夹。接着，他回头朝这辆没有门的厢式汽车的后座望了望——威尔逊和他的妻子就坐在那儿。那俩人兴高采烈，都咧着嘴笑呢。威尔逊把身子朝前探了探低声说：

“瞧那些落在地上的鸟儿。这就是说，那只老狮子抛下被它咬死的猎物走了。”

麦康伯可以看见，在远处河岸上，一群秃鹫在树林的上空盘旋，然后垂直下落。

“那只狮子很可能会来这一带喝水，”威尔逊悄声说，“在它去睡觉之前。得把眼睛睁大些。”

汽车慢慢悠悠行驶在高高隆起的河岸上。在这一段，河水把满是石块的河床冲出了个深坑。他们在参天大树间迤逦而行。麦康伯仔细观察着对岸的动静，突然感到威尔逊用手抓住了他的胳膊。汽车停下了。

“它就在那里。”他听见威尔逊压低声音说，“在前方靠右的地方。你下车干掉它。那是一只非常棒的狮子。”

此时，麦康伯看到了那只狮子。它几乎完全是侧身站着，将巨大的脑袋抬起，转向他们。清晨微风拂面，把狮身上的深色鬃毛微微吹起。狮子看上去是个庞然大物，其轮廓于灰蒙蒙的晨曦中巍然挺立在隆起的河岸上，肩膀厚重，肚子像水桶般光滑、滚圆。

“它离这儿有多远？”麦康伯抓起枪问。

“大概有七十五码吧。你下车，干掉它。”

“为什么不叫我从车上开枪？”

“不能从车上开枪。”麦康伯听见威尔逊伏在他耳边说，“下车去，把它干掉。它不会老待在那儿等你的。”

麦康伯钻出前座旁的圆弧形开口，踩在踏板上，然后把脚落在了地面上。狮子仍站在那里张望，威武而冷静，望着这个在它的眼里仅显现出轮廓的物体，样子像只超级大犀牛。人的气味没有传到它的鼻孔，于是它只是张望着，望着这个物体，巨大的脑袋微微左右晃动着。这个时候，它并不感到害怕。不过，面对着这样一个东西，它在走下河岸喝水之前，觉得有些犹豫。它看见一个人影从这个物体上脱离出来，便把它那沉重的脑袋调转开，晃晃悠悠向着树丛隐蔽地走去。此时只听啪的一声，它感到一颗.30-06射出的220格令(4)重的实心子弹击中了它的侧腹，胃里突然有一种火辣辣的烧灼感，令它直想呕吐。它抬起巨大的爪子小跑起来，脚步沉重，由于腹部受伤，身子一晃一晃的。就在它穿过树丛向高高的荒草那儿奔逃寻找隐身之处时，啪地又传来一声枪响，子弹擦身而过，把空气都撕裂了。接着又是一声响，它感到下肋被击中了，子弹射穿了它的躯体，一股滚烫的泛着泡沫的鲜血从嘴里奔涌而出。它快步飞跑向高高的荒草那儿，要找个地方卧下来，让人看不见，等拿着那个啪啪响东西的人走近时，就扑上去咬住他。

麦康伯走下汽车时，并没有想到狮子会有什么感觉。他只知道自己的两只手在发抖。离开汽车的当儿，连腿都快挪动不了了。他的大腿发硬，不过他却可以感到大腿上的肌肉在颤抖。他举起步枪，瞄准狮子的脑袋和肩膀相连接的地方，扣动了扳机。扣扳机他用了很大劲，觉得手指都快要断了，可是一点动静也没有。这时他才意识到，原来是保险栓没有打开。于是他将枪身放低，打开保险栓，同时又向前僵硬地迈了一步。狮子看见他的轮廓与汽车的轮廓分离开，便转身迈着碎步小跑走了。麦康伯开枪时，听见嗵的一声，说明子弹击中了目标，可是狮子仍在跑。他又开了一枪。大家看见子弹与跑动着的狮子擦身而过，在前方激起一股尘土。他又补了一枪，这次没忘将枪口朝下低一些。人人都听见了子弹击中目标的声音。狮子开始飞奔，没等他推上枪栓，一溜烟钻进了高高的荒草丛里。

麦康伯站在原地，胃里感到一阵难受，手哆嗦不止，手里的斯普林菲尔德步枪仍处于瞄准状态。他的妻子和罗伯特·威尔逊走过来站在他身旁。那两个扛枪人也在跟前，用瓦坎巴土话叽里哇啦交谈着。

“我打中了，”麦康伯说，“击中了两次。”

“你击中了它的胃，还击中了它前身的某个地方。”威尔逊缺乏热情地说。那两个扛枪人停止了交谈，都阴沉着脸。

“原来是可以一枪毙命的。”威尔逊又说了一句，“这下子得等一会儿，再去看结果怎么样了。”

“你这是什么意思？”

“那就是等它不行了，咱们再找过去。”

“明白了。”麦康伯说。

“这头狮子相当棒，”威尔逊带着几分高涨的情绪说，“只可惜它跑进了一个糟糕的地方。”

“为什么说是糟糕的地方呢？”

“那是因为你看不见它，除非迎面碰上。”

“明白了。”麦康伯说。

“走吧。”威尔逊说，“太太可以留在车里。咱们过去看看它留下的血迹。”

“你留在这里吧，玛戈。”麦康伯对妻子说。他嘴干得嗓子眼冒烟，说话感到困难。

“为什么？”她问。

“威尔逊这么说的。”

“我们过去看看。”威尔逊说，“你留下，从这儿看更清楚。”

“好吧。”

接着，威尔逊操起斯瓦希里语对司机交代了一通。后者点点头说：“遵命，先生。”

随后，他们走下陡峭的河岸，蹚过河水，绕过一块块大石头，用手抓住突出来的树根，登上了对岸。沿岸走去，他们找到了麦康伯开第一枪后，狮子跑过的地方。扛枪人用草茎指出矮草上深红色的血迹，那血迹向前延伸，一直延伸到岸边的树丛后。

“接下来怎么办？”麦康伯问。

“没多少选择的余地。”威尔逊说，“汽车开不过来。河岸太陡。只好等它僵硬下来一些，咱们再过去查看一下。”

“就不能放把火烧草吗？”麦康伯问。

“草太青了。”

“那么，就不能派人用棍子击打草丛，赶它出来吗？”

威尔逊心里掂量了一下，用眼睛望着他。“此计当然可行，”他说，“只是有点太玩命了。咱们都知道，这头狮子是受了伤的。没受伤的狮子是可以赶的——它听见响动会躲开的。而受伤的狮子会直接扑过来。你现在看不见它，除非跟它打个照面。它会平卧在一个你觉得连兔子也藏不住的地方，完全隐蔽起来。这种情况，是不便于派人过去的，那是送死。”

“叫扛枪人去看看怎么样？”

“哦，他们要守在咱们身边。这是他们的职责。对于这一点，他们是签了合同的。你瞧，他们有点不太高兴，是不是？”

“反正我是不愿过去的。”麦康伯说。他连想也没想，话便脱口而出了。

“我也不愿去呀。”威尔逊乐呵呵地说，“不过，的确是别无选择了。”随后，他略作沉思，向麦康伯瞟了一眼，结果看见他抖如筛糠，脸上一副可怜巴巴的神情。

“当然喽，不一定非得要你去。要知道，雇我来就是干这种事情的。我的身价高也正因为如此。”

“你的意思是自己独身前往？为什么不让它待在那儿，非得去查看呢？”

罗伯特·威尔逊的职业就是跟狮子打交道，以及处理由狮子引出的问题，之前倒是没多想麦康伯，只是觉得他有点怯懦罢了，而现在突然觉得自己开错了一扇旅馆的房门，瞧见了叫人害臊的现象。

“此话怎讲？”

“为什么不让它待在那儿，非得去查看呢？”

“你是说咱们假装什么事也没有，权当没有射中它？”

“不是的。仅仅丢下它别管就是了。”

“那是绝对不行的。”

“为什么不行？”

“一是因为它疼得死去活来，二是因为让其他人碰上会遭遇不测。”

“明白了。”

“不过，你不一定非得再管这件事了。”

“我还是愿意管的。”麦康伯说，“我只不过心里有些害怕罢了，这你是知道的。”

“咱们一起过去，我打头阵，”威尔逊说，“让康格尼断后。你随在我身后，稍微靠边一点。也许路上能听见它的吼声。看见它，咱们俩都开枪。什么顾虑都不要有。我会做你的后盾的。说实在的，你也许还是别去的好。那样会好得多的。你何不过河去跟太太在一起，让我把此事了结掉算了！”

“不，我还是想去看看。”

“那好吧。”威尔逊说，“不过，你如果心里不愿去，就别去了。现在这是我分内的事情了，这你知道的。”

“我心里是想去的。”麦康伯说。

他们在一棵树下席地而坐，吞云吐雾，抽起烟来。

“趁着在这里等待的工夫，想回去对太太说一声吗？”威尔逊问。

“不了。”

“那我就回去一下，叫她别着急。”

“好吧。”麦康伯说。他坐在那儿，胳肢窝里直冒汗，嘴发干，胃里觉得空空的。他恨不得能鼓起勇气来，对威尔逊说一声，让他独自去结果掉那头狮子。他不知道威尔逊心里窝着火，因为之前没发现对方有发怒的征兆，于是就由着对方去见他的妻子了。威尔逊返回时，他仍坐在原地。“我把你的大枪取来了。”威尔逊说，“你把它拿上。等的时间大概也够了。咱们走吧。”

麦康伯将大枪接过来，只听威尔逊说：

“跟在我后边，靠右首大概五码就行了。我让你做什么，你就严格地按我的话去做。”随后，他又用斯瓦希里语向两个扛枪人交代了一通，而听话的人表情凝重。

“咱们出发。”他末了说道。

“能先喝口水吗？”麦康伯问。那个年纪大一些的扛枪人皮带上挂着一个水壶，威尔逊对他说了一声，他便将水壶取下来，拧开盖子，然后把水壶递给了麦康伯。麦康伯接过来，觉得水壶沉甸甸的，毛毡水壶套摸上去毛刺刺的，一摸就知道是劣质品。他拿起水壶喝水，顺便望了一眼前方的高草以及高草后面的平顶树丛。一股微风吹来，荒草在微风中轻轻摆动，形成了一道道细浪。他瞧瞧身旁的扛枪人，可以看出对方也在经受着恐惧的折磨。

在荒草丛中三十五码的地方，那头大狮子平卧在地上，两只耳朵朝后，一动不动，只是微微地把它那长长的穗状的黑尾巴上下拍打几下。一来到这块藏身之地，困难的境况就出现了。圆滚滚的肚子被子弹射穿，使它痛苦万分，而肺部中的那一枪叫它虚弱了下来，每呼吸一次，就有稀稀的血沫从嘴里涌出。它的腰部湿湿的，滚烫滚烫，实心弹在它那褐色的毛皮上留下的小枪眼上爬满了苍蝇。它那黄色的大眼睛充满了仇恨，眯成了一条缝，直端端望着前方，只有在呼吸时感到疼痛才眨巴一下。它的爪子插入松软的干土里。所有的疼痛、难受和仇恨都凝聚在了一起，与残存的力量融合在一处，形成一股聚合力，时刻准备扑向来犯之敌。它可以听见人们的说话声，于是便耐心等待着，调动起每一根神经，准备那些人一进草丛就冲上前去。听着人类的说话声，它的尾巴变硬了，上下抽打着。当那几个人走到草地边时，它嗓子眼发出呼噜的一声咳嗽，忽地冲了过去。

那个叫康格尼的年纪大些的扛枪人正走在前头查看血迹，而威尔逊望着草丛观察动静，拿着枪随时准备射击。另外一个扛枪人眼睛注视着前方，竖耳倾听着。麦康伯贴近威尔逊走着，手里端着步枪。刚一进草丛，麦康伯便听见狮子的嗓子眼被血呛住而发出的呼噜咳嗽声，见荒草里有东西唰地扑了上来。他吓得掉头便跑，一路狂奔，没了魂似的跑到空旷的野地，接着向河边逃命。

此时，他听见轰隆一声！那是威尔逊的大枪射击的声音。接着又是轰隆一声，震耳欲聋。转过身来，他看见了那头狮子，样子很惨，好像半个脑袋都不见了，还拼命地朝高草地边的威尔逊跟前爬。而那个红脸汉子端着那支难看的、短短的步枪，推上枪栓，仔细瞄准，开了一枪，枪口又发出轰隆一声响。正在爬动的、沉重的、黄黄的狮子躯体逐渐变得僵硬了，而它的那个巨大的、残缺不全的头颅向前耷拉了下来。麦康伯独自一人站在他逃跑穿过的那块空地上，手里拿着上好了子弹的步枪，而那两个黑人和一个白人回过头来轻蔑地看着他。他知道狮子已经死了。他抬腿向威尔逊走去，就连他高高的个子对他似乎也是赤裸裸的谴责。威尔逊看了他一眼说：

“想照相吗？”

“不了。”他说。

返回汽车的路上，谁都没有再说一句话。到了汽车跟前，才听见威尔逊说道：

“这头狮子真够棒的。让伙计们剥皮，咱俩可以到阴凉地歇歇去。”

麦康伯的妻子对丈夫看也不看，他也没有看她。两口子坐在后排，威尔逊坐在前排。当丈夫的曾经一度伸出手，拉住了妻子的手，眼睛却没有看她，而后者把手抽了回去。目光越过小河投向那两个扛枪人剥狮子皮的地方，他可以看出妻子将全过程都瞧在了眼里。两口子呆坐时，妻子朝前探探身子，把手搭在了威尔逊的肩膀上。威尔逊转过头来，而她欠起身子，趴在低矮的座位靠背上，在他的嘴上亲了一口。

“啊，哎呀。”威尔逊叫了一声，原本就红的脸变得更红了。

“这是给你的，罗伯特·威尔逊先生，”她说道，“英俊潇洒、红脸膛的罗伯特·威尔逊先生。”

说完，她又在麦康伯身旁坐了下来，眼睛却望着河对岸狮子横尸的地方，只见狮子的两条前腿朝天，皮正在被那两个黑人剥掉，露出白白的肌肉、腱子肉以及鼓胀胀、雪白的肚皮。最后，扛枪人干完活，把一张又湿又沉的狮子皮扛了回来，先是卷在一起，然后带着它爬上了汽车的尾部。汽车启动了。在返回营地的路上，没有一个人说话。

这就是猎狮的经过。那头狮子在开始发动攻击之前，以及在攻击的过程中被一颗初速度达两百英里的.505子弹以难以置信的冲击力射中嘴，究竟感觉怎么样，麦康伯一无所知。他也不知道在轰隆第二声枪响打烂了它的后半身，而它依然向那个轰隆作响、断送了它的东西爬去时，心里究竟有什么感受。对于这些，威尔逊是知道一些的，仅仅用这么一句话来表达：“简直是一头非常棒的狮子。”可是，至于威尔逊心里有什么感受，麦康伯是不知道的，他也不知道妻子的感受，只知道她心里已经和他决裂了。

妻子以前也跟他决裂过，但时间都不很长。他很有钱，以后会更有钱，所以他知道，即便现在她也不会离开他的。他真正知道的事情并不多，而这是其中之一。除此之外，他还知道摩托车（那是早年的事情了）和汽车方面的情况，知道怎样打野鸭、钓鱼（有鳟鱼、鲑鱼以及海鱼），知道书里的性爱故事（这方面的书很多，简直不计其数），熟知球类运动，知道怎样养狗（对于养马不太了解），知道怎样捂紧自己的钱口袋，对于他这个圈子遇到的情况大多都知道，还知道妻子绝不会离开他。妻子一直都是个大美女，在非洲仍是个大美女，但在国内却没有美丽到能离开他去享受更阔绰的人生，对此他俩都心中有数。她已经错失良机，无法再离开他了，这一点他是知道的。假如他善于猎艳，那她也许会多几分忧虑，害怕他另寻新欢，娶一房漂亮妻子，可是她对他太了解了，知道不必为此操心。再说，他一直都很宽宏大度，倘若这不是他最大的弱点，那就是最大的优点了。

总而言之，在别人眼里，他们是一对比较幸福的夫妻。这类夫妻，尽管街坊经常有谣传说要散伙，也绝对不会各奔东西的。至于他们到所谓的“黑暗非洲”狩猎，一位社交生活专栏记者说是“为他们备受羡慕、固若金汤的浪漫生活添上几分颇为冒险的色彩”。黑暗非洲是由马丁·约翰逊夫妇(5)照亮的，他们在非洲猎取狮子、野牛和大象，为自然史博物馆收集标本，并将这些场面拍成了多部电影。要说麦康伯两口子的关系，还是那位专栏记者报道说他们曾三次濒于离婚，实情也的确如此。不过，他们每一次都会重归于好，因为他们有着坚实的婚姻基础。玛戈太漂亮了，让麦康伯欲离难舍，而麦康伯的钱太多了，叫玛戈根本离不开他。

此刻大约是凌晨三点钟。弗朗西斯·麦康伯自打不再想那头狮子之后，稍微睡了一会儿，接着便睡睡醒醒的。他做了个梦，梦见那头狮子站在他面前，脑袋上血淋淋的，吓得他醒了过来。他侧耳听听动静，心里扑扑乱跳。他看看帐篷里另一张小床，发现妻子不在上面。他躺在那儿左思右想，有两个小时的时间。

两个小时之后，他的妻子回到了帐篷里，撩起蚊帐，舒舒服服爬到了床上。

“你去哪儿啦？”麦康伯在黑影里问。

“哦，”她回了一声，“醒着呢？”

“到哪里去了？”

“出去吸了口新鲜空气。”

“胡说八道。”

“你想让我说什么呢，亲爱的？”

“你到底去哪儿了？”

“去呼吸新鲜空气了呀。”

“这倒是个新借口。你这个骚货。”

“你呢？你是个胆小鬼。”

“胆小鬼就胆小鬼，”他说，“那又怎么样？”

“至于我，我不会怎么样的。算啦，不要再说了，亲爱的，我都快困死啦。”

“你以为我什么气都能咽得下去。”

“我知道你能咽得下去的，小心肝。”

“哼，我咽不下这口气。”

“求求你，亲爱的，别说了，我都快困死啦。”

“这种事是不应该发生的。你是答应过我的。”

“哎，现在事情已经如此了。”她语气甜蜜地说。

“你说过如果这次来旅行，你就不会再干这种事情了。这你是许诺过的。”

“不错，亲爱的。我的确是这么想的。可是，昨天把一切全给毁了。此事就不说了，好不好？”

“一有个机会，你就急不可耐，对不对？”

“请别说了，我困极了，亲爱的。”

“我就是要说。”

“那你就说你的吧，我反正是要睡了。”话刚说完，她就睡着了。

次日天未亮，三人坐在桌旁吃早餐。弗朗西斯·麦康伯觉得，在所有的仇人中，罗伯特·威尔逊是他不共戴天的头号仇敌。

“睡得还好吧？”威尔逊一边用他那喉音问了一声，一边往烟袋里装着烟丝。

“你呢？”

“好极啦。”白人猎手说。

“你这个王八蛋，嚣张的王八蛋！”麦康伯在心里骂道。

“看来，她进帐篷时把他给吵醒了。”威尔逊心想，一边用缺乏表情、冷冰冰的眼睛打量着那两口子，“哼，他为什么就不能管住自己的妻子，让她待在应该待的地方呢？他把我当成了什么——一尊麻木的石膏圣徒像吗？要怪都怪他管不住自己的妻子。毛病出在他自己身上。”

“你觉得咱们能找到野牛吗？”玛戈把一盘杏子推开，启口问道。

“机会是有的。”威尔逊冲她笑了笑说，“你为什么不留在营地里呢？”

“那是绝对不行的。”她说。

“你为什么不下一道命令，叫她留在营地里？”威尔逊对麦康伯说。

“这道命令还是由你下吧。”麦康伯冷冰冰地说。

“就不要下什么命令不命令的了。”玛戈又转过身对着麦康伯语气欢快地说：“你呢，就不要冒傻气了。”

“准备好出发了吗？”麦康伯问。

“随时都可以走。”威尔逊说，“你愿意让太太也跟着去吗？”

“我愿意不愿意又管什么用呢？”

罗伯特·威尔逊心想：“真是活见鬼！简直糟得一塌糊涂。早知道会闹成这样。哎，事已至此，只能这样了。”

“是的，是不管用。”他说。

“你敢肯定你不想陪她留在营地，让我自己去打野牛吗？”麦康伯问。

“这行不通。”威尔逊说，“我要是你，就不会说这么难听的话。”

“这不是说什么难听的话，而是我觉得恶心。”

“恶心就是一个难听的字眼。”

“弗朗西斯，你能不能说些通情达理的话！”麦康伯的妻子说道。

“我的话他妈的太通情达理了。”麦康伯说，“你吃过这么脏的东西吗？”

“难道这食物有问题吗？”威尔逊不动声色地问。

“不比别的事情问题更大。”

“我这就让你放下心来，先生。”威尔逊小声说，“这里有个负责饭菜的杂役，他懂得一点英语。”

“让他见鬼去吧。”

威尔逊立起身，抽着烟走开了，对一个正站在那儿等他的扛枪人用斯瓦希里语说了几句话。麦康伯和妻子仍坐在桌旁。他把眼睛盯在咖啡杯上。

“如果你胡闹，我就离开你，亲爱的。”玛戈平静地说。

“不，你不会的。”

“你可以试试看。”

“你绝不会离开我的。”

“那好，”她说，“我不离开你，你可要放规矩些。”

“让我放规矩？说的是屁话。要放规矩的是你自己。”

“是你。是你应该规矩些。”

“你为什么就不能做出努力，注意注意自己的行为呢？”

“我努力了，努力了很长时间，很长很长的时间。”

“我讨厌那个红脸猪猡。”麦康伯说，“一看见他，我就恨得牙根痒痒。”

“他是个挺不错的人。”

“哼，你还是闭上嘴吧。”麦康伯几乎吼了起来。就在这时，汽车开了过来，停在了餐厅帐篷前，司机和那两个扛枪人下了车。威尔逊走了过来，看了看仍坐在餐桌旁的这对夫妻。

“去打猎吗？”

“去。”麦康伯说着站起了身，“去的。”

“最好带件毛衣。车上有些凉。”威尔逊说。

“我去把我的皮夹克拿上。”玛戈说。

“杂役已经拿来了。”威尔逊对她说。他说完爬上车，坐到了前排，跟司机在一起，而弗朗西斯·麦康伯和妻子谁都没说话，坐到了后排。

“但愿这个愚蠢的家伙别一冲动，开枪把我的后脑勺打掉。”威尔逊暗自思忖，“打猎时带着女人真不方便。”

在灰蒙蒙的晨曦中，汽车嘎吱嘎吱开下河岸，从一处鹅卵石浅滩过了河，然后走“之”字形路，爬上对面陡峭的河岸。昨天威尔逊叫人开出了一条路来，这样汽车就能开到远处去了——那儿林木茂盛，连绵起伏，跟猎苑一样。

“真是个美好的早晨。”威尔逊心想。露水很重。汽车轮子碾过青草和低矮的灌木丛，可以闻到被碾碎了的蕨叶散发出的清香。这气味和马鞭草的味道很相像。汽车行驶在这一片人迹罕至的猎苑似的地带，而他欢喜地嗅着清晨露水的气味，嗅着被碾碎的蕨类植物散发的芳香，欣赏着在晨雾里隐隐发暗的一根根树干。此刻，他把后排的那两口子忘到了九霄云外，心里盘算着打野牛的事情。他要猎杀的野牛白天待在沼泽泥地里，根本无法到跟前猎杀。可是在夜间，野牛会来到这一片空地上吃草。如果把汽车开过去，阻断它们回沼泽地的路径，麦康伯的机会就来了，可以在这开阔地开枪射击。他并不想和麦康伯来这块林木茂盛的地方打野牛。不管是打野牛还是别的什么猎物，他压根就不愿意跟麦康伯在一起。不过，他毕竟是个职业猎手，曾经陪许多稀奇古怪的人一起打过猎。假如今天能猎杀到野牛，接下来该猎杀的就只剩下犀牛了。那时，这个可怜的家伙就可以结束这种危险的游戏了，情况也许能好转。那时，他就斩断跟这个女人的情缘，而麦康伯也会恢复过来的。看上去，这种事情麦康伯一定经历过不少。真是个可怜蛋！他一定有自己的方法恢复过来的。哎，这个可怜虫，要怪也要怪他自己。

他，罗伯特·威尔逊，每次打猎都带着一张双人床，准备迎接任何飞来的艳遇。他陪各种国籍的客户打猎，有些客户放荡不羁、玩世不恭。有些女客户如果不和这位白人猎手分享分享他的双人床，就觉得自己的钱花得不值。在交往中，有些女人他还是挺喜欢的，可是一旦分手，便从心里瞧不起她们。不过，话又说回来，他是靠这些人谋生的。只要受雇于他们，他们的标准就是他的标准。

只有在打猎时，他们要服从于他的标准。对于打猎，他是有自己的标准的，客户要是不服从，那就请他们另寻高手去。他很清楚，客户们为此对他心怀敬意。不过，这个麦康伯却是个怪家伙，简直古怪极了。他的那个妻子……他的那个妻子嘛……哎，他的那个妻子嘛……想到此处，他就不再往下想了，而是回头看了看那两口子——麦康伯阴沉着脸，怒容满面；玛戈则冲他嫣然一笑。她看上去比平时年轻、天真，也比平时水灵，这种美并非矫揉造作的美。天知道她心里在想什么。昨天夜里，她的废话不多。就冲这一点，他还是蛮愿意见她的。

汽车爬上一个小土坡，穿过树林，来到了一片开阔的草地上，望上去像大草原一样。他们在树的遮蔽下贴着草地边走，司机把车开得很慢，威尔逊仔细观察着草原的动静，然后把目光投向远处。他让汽车停下，用望远镜瞭望了一番。随后，他叫司机继续把车朝前开。汽车慢慢行驶，一路绕过疣猪挖的洞穴以及蚂蚁筑起的土围子。威尔逊扫视着开阔地，然后突然转过身说：

“上帝呀，它们原来在那儿！”

汽车颠簸着冲上前去，威尔逊用斯瓦希里语急促地对司机说着什么。麦康伯顺着他指的方向望去，看见了三个庞然大物般的黑色野兽，身躯长大，几乎呈圆柱形，看上去像黑颜色的大油罐车，此时在开阔的草地上顺着远处的边缘飞奔。它们快如风，脖子僵硬，身子也硬挺挺的，脑袋前抵，一动不动，一对宽宽的黑犄角向上翘起。

“那是三只老公牛。”威尔逊说，“咱们去把它们的路截断，别让它们跑进沼泽地。”

汽车以一小时四十五英里的速度在草地上狂奔。麦康伯观望着，看见野牛变得越来越大，最后看清了其中一只大个子公牛的样子——灰色，无毛，满身疥癣，脖子和肩膀连在一起，一对犄角黑得发亮。它跟着同伴们，在稍微靠后一点的地方。三只公牛排成一列，迈着稳稳的步子向前冲去。汽车颠了颠，摇晃了几下，好像跳过一条路似的。车开到跟前时，可以看到奔逃的公牛是多么庞大，稀稀拉拉长着几根毛的牛皮上满是尘土，可以看到它那宽宽的犄角管以及那张得大大的、宽宽的鼻孔。他一边看着一边拿起了步枪。此刻只听威尔逊大叫一声：“笨蛋，别从车上开枪！”此时他毫无畏怯之心，只有对威尔逊的仇恨。司机踩了一脚刹车，汽车猛地停住，车身向旁边一斜。没等车停稳，威尔逊从一侧跳下车，而他从另一侧跳下车，双脚踏上好像仍在快速移动的土地，不由打了个趔趄。他朝着逃窜的公牛开了一枪，听见子弹噗的一声射进了牛身子，接着一枪又一枪，把子弹全打光了，而公牛仍在迈着稳稳的步子奔逃。这时他才记起应该朝前瞄一些把子弹射入牛的肩膀。正当他摸索着重新上子弹时，看见那只公牛倒下去了，跪在地上，巨大的头颅朝上扬了扬。他见另外两只牛仍在飞奔，于是便向前边的那只射击，一枪命中。他又开了一枪，这次打偏了，却听见轰隆一声巨响，原来是威尔逊开了枪。只见前边的那只牛向前一窜，一个倒栽葱倒了下去。

“打另外的一只！”威尔逊说，“现在才是你亮枪法的时候。”

另外的那只公牛仍在疾奔，步子还是那么稳。他开了一枪，没打中，扬起一股尘土，威尔逊开枪也打偏了，子弹着地处升起一片尘云。只听威尔逊大叫一声：“咱们追去。隔得太远了！”随即一把拽住了他的胳膊。两人回到车上，一边一个站在踏板上，汽车左右摇晃着在坑洼不平的地面上飞驰，逼近那只梗着脖子、迈着稳稳步子向前冲的公牛。

汽车追到了公牛的身后。麦康伯给枪里装子弹，几颗子弹掉在了地上，而枪膛里卡了壳，等他排除了障碍，汽车眼看就追上公牛了。此时却听见威尔逊喊了一声“停车”，汽车一个急刹车，差点没向旁边侧翻。麦康伯身子朝前一倾，然后站稳了脚跟。他咔地推上枪栓，尽可能向前瞄准，对着那只狂奔不止的公牛，向它那圆滚滚的黑色脊背开了一枪，接着又一枪一枪地持续射击，枪枪命中，但可以看到没有一枪是致命的。这时，威尔逊开枪了，声音大得能把耳朵震聋，只见公牛脚步一踉跄。麦康伯仔细瞄准，又开了一枪，公牛倒下去了，跪在了地上。

“很好，”威尔逊说，“干得漂亮，三只全报销了。”

麦康伯高兴得飘飘欲仙。

“你开了几枪？”他问道。

“只开了三枪。”威尔逊说，“头一只是你打死的。那只最大。另外两只是我帮了你一把，把它们撂倒了，怕的是它们会躲起来。反正它们都是你干掉的，我只是帮衬了一把罢了。你的枪法棒极了。”

“走，回车上去，”麦康伯说，“我想喝上一杯。”

“先把这只牛结果了再走。”威尔逊说。那只牛跪在地上，见他们走上前去，便狂怒地摆动着脑袋，牛眼圆睁，怒气冲天地大吼大叫。

“小心点，别让它站起来。”威尔逊叮咛道，“站得稍微偏一些，对准它的耳朵根，在它的脖子上来一枪。”

麦康伯仔细瞄准公牛那粗壮的、愤怒地摆来摆去的脖子，冲着脖子的正中心开了一枪。枪声一响，公牛的脑袋耷拉了下来。

“这下好了。”威尔逊说，“打到脊椎上了。这几只牛看上去很棒，是不是？”

“走，喝酒去吧。”麦康伯说。他感觉好极了，一生中从来都没有过这样好的感觉。

他的妻子正坐在车上，脸色惨白惨白。“你真是棒极啦，亲爱的。”她对丈夫说，“车开得快极了。”

“颠簸得厉害吗？”威尔逊问。

“吓死人啦。我这一生从来都没有这样害怕过。”

“大家伙都来喝酒吧。”麦康伯说。

“乐于从命。”威尔逊说，“先让太太喝一口吧。”

玛戈接过酒瓶喝了一口精纯的威士忌，把酒咽下肚时身子哆嗦了一下。接着，她把酒瓶递给了麦康伯，而后者随手将其给了威尔逊。

“刺激，惊悚，”她说，“看得我脑袋疼得厉害。允许你们从车上开枪，这我是不知道的。”

“没有人从车上开枪呀。”威尔逊用冷冷的语气说。

“我是说驱车追赶它们。”

“一般情况下是不会这样做的。不过，驱车追赶，我觉得很好玩。开车穿过坑坑洼洼的平原，险情不断，这比徒步狩猎更具冒险性。每次开枪，野牛一发性子，都有可能会向我们冲来。它有的是机会。此事不便向任何人提起，说起来这可是违法的。”

“乘坐汽车追赶那些可怜无助的大牲口，”玛戈说，“在我看来十分不公平。”

“是吗？”威尔逊说。

“假如内罗毕得知这种情况，会怎么样呢？”

“首先，会吊销我的执照。除此之外，还会有其他不愉快的事情。”威尔逊拿起酒瓶喝了一口说，“那时，我就没饭碗了。”

“真的？”

“是真的。”

“好呀，”麦康伯说，一天里头一次露出了笑容，“这下子她可抓住你的短处了。”

“瞧你把话说得难听的，弗朗西斯。”玛戈·麦康伯说。

威尔逊看了看这两口子，心想：“半斤的男人娶了个八两的妻子，谁知道他们的孩子会是几斤几两呢。”心里这么想，他嘴上说的却是另一码事：“一个扛枪人不见了。你们注意到了吗？”

“我的上帝，没注意到。”麦康伯说。

“哦，他过来了，”威尔逊说，“没事的。他肯定是打完第一只公牛开车走的时候摔下车去了。”

那个中年扛枪人一瘸一拐地在渐渐走近。他头戴编织帽，上身穿卡其布衫，下穿短裤，足蹬橡胶凉鞋，阴沉着脸，一副闷闷不乐的表情。走到跟前时，叽里呱啦用斯瓦希里语冲威尔逊大声说了些什么，大家都看到这位白人猎手脸色大变。

“他说什么来着？”玛戈问。

“他说头一只公牛站起来，藏进灌木丛里去了。”威尔逊说道，声音里一点波动都没有。

“哦？”麦康伯茫然地说。

“这次又要跟打狮子的那次一模一样了。”玛戈充满期待地说。

“跟打狮子的那次没有一点相似之处。”威尔逊说，“还要来口酒吗，麦康伯？”

“谢谢，再来一口吧。”麦康伯说。他以为猎狮子时的那种感觉又会回到心头，但这样的情况没有出现。他平生第一次真正地有了一种毫无畏惧的感觉。代替畏惧感的是显而易见的喜悦情绪。

“走，去看看第二只公牛。”威尔逊说，“我叫司机把车停在阴凉地。”

“去干什么来着？”玛格丽特·麦康伯问。

“去看看公牛。”威尔逊说。

“我也去。”

“那就走吧。”

三个人走过去到开阔的野地，只见第二只公牛躺在那儿，又黑又大，脑袋向前耷拉在草地上，两只犄角朝两边分开，中间隔得很宽。

“这只公牛的头真是漂亮，”威尔逊说，“两只犄角之间的距离差不多有五十英寸。”

麦康伯兴致勃勃地望着那只牛。

“样子狰狞可怕。”玛戈说，“能不能到阴凉地里去？”

“当然可以。”威尔逊说。随后他又用手指着对麦康伯说：“看见那片灌木丛了吗？”

“看见了。”

“第一只公牛就躲在了那里。那个扛枪人说，他摔下车时，那只牛正躺在地上。他光顾着看咱们拼命地追赶另外两只逃窜的牛了，后来瞧了瞧跟前，见躺在地上的牛站了起来，正盯着他望呢。他吓得撒丫子就跑，而那只牛慢慢悠悠地走开，躲进了那片灌木丛里。”

“是不是需要进去把它找出来？”麦康伯急切地问。

威尔逊把他打量了几眼，心想：“真是邪了门了。昨天他还吓得屁滚尿流，今天就天不怕地不怕的。”

“暂时别去，让它再活一会儿。”

“还是到阴凉地里去吧。”玛戈说。她脸色苍白，像病了一样。

三人寻路回到汽车跟前（汽车停放在一棵枝叶宽展如盖的孤树底下），全都爬上了车。

“也许它已经死在了那里。”威尔逊说，“过一会儿咱们去看看。”

麦康伯莫名其妙地感到一阵狂喜，那是一种以前从未体验过的狂喜心情。

“上帝呀，去追杀它！”他说道，“这种激动的心情我以前从未有过。真是扣人心弦，你说是不是，玛戈？”

“我讨厌。”

“为什么？”

“反正我就是讨厌。”她痛苦地说，“我感到的是厌恶。”

“要知道，我觉得自己以后什么都不会再害怕了。”麦康伯对威尔逊说，“自打一眼看见公牛，并开始追杀时，我的内心就发生了变化，就像有一道堤坝决了口一样。这是一种彻彻底底的激动心情。”

“就像是五脏六腑被水清洗过了一样吧？”威尔逊说，“一些奇怪的现象的确会发生在人们的身上。”

麦康伯满面生辉。“要知道，我的身上的确发生了变化。”他说道，“我感觉像变了一个人一样。”

他的妻子什么也没说，以异样的目光看了看他。她身子靠后坐在座位上，而麦康伯身子前倾跟威尔逊滔滔不绝地说话，后者则扭过身隔着前排的椅背回话。

“要知道，我很想再去猎杀一头狮子。”麦康伯说，“现在，我对狮子真的不感到害怕了。说到底，它们能把你怎么样呢？”

“是这么回事。”威尔逊说，“大不了就是命一条嘛。那是怎么说的来着？莎士比亚说的真是他妈的好。让我想想，看能不能想起来。啊，说的真是太精彩了。以前有段时间，我倒是经常引用他的这段话的。大概是这么说的：‘说实在的，我对死亡并不在乎。人生在世谁无死？人人都欠上帝一条命，该怎么还就怎么还吧，今年死了，明年就不用死了。’(6)你说精彩不精彩？”

一口气说出了自己的生活信条，他觉得很不好意思。不过，男人突然长大成熟，这他是见过的，每一次见了心里都大受感动。这种感动可不是看见人们过二十一岁成年生日的那种感动。

由于一次奇异的机会参加狩猎，没有事先精心筹划，而是仓促行动起来，结果这种变化发生在了麦康伯身上。不管它是怎么发生的，铁的事实是它已经发生了。威尔逊心想，现在再看看这个家伙吧！有些人在很长时间里都是小孩子，有些甚至终身都是小孩子，都五十岁了还一身孩子气。美国男人就是孩子气十足，真是一些奇怪的人。不过，他现在喜欢上了麦康伯。这个家伙怪怪的。也许，这意味着他和玛戈暧昧的关系结束了。啊，那将是大好事情！一件非常好的事情！这个窝囊废大概一直都唯唯诺诺的，不知是什么原因造成的，而现在这种现象结束了。他刚才没有时间对公牛产生害怕的心情，再加上肚子里窝了一团火，还有汽车也发生了作用——汽车消除了一些生疏感。反正他现在成了一个英勇无畏的人。战争中也见过这种转变，转变之大胜过失去童贞。恐惧感消失了，像做手术割除了似的。取而代之的是另一样东西，一样男人所应该具有的重要的东西——正是这样东西使男人成为男子汉。对于这样东西，女人是很清楚的。总之，麦康伯已经丝毫没有恐惧之心了。

玛格丽特·麦康伯从座位的角落里打量着这两个男人。威尔逊没有变化，还是昨天的那个男人——当时她第一次发现他是个很有本事的人。而在弗朗西斯·麦康伯身上她看出了变化。

“对于即将发生的事情，你有没有一种兴奋的感觉？”麦康伯仍沉浸在一片全新的天地里，于是这样问道。

“这种心情是不应该讲出来的。”威尔逊看着对方的脸说，“还不如说自己感到害怕，这样倒时尚得多。注意，你还会害怕的，还会害怕许多次呢。”

“但对这一次即将采取的行动，你有没有一种兴奋的感觉？”

“有。”威尔逊说，“有倒是有的，只是不要多说就是了。话说多了，就没有意思了。话说三遍淡如水嘛。”

“你们俩闲扯个啥劲！”玛戈说，“就因为开着汽车追杀可怜无助的动物，你们说起话就像英雄人物一样！”

“对不起，”威尔逊说，“我空话说得太多了。”他心里觉得她在为此担惊受怕。

“如果你不知道我们在谈什么，为什么就不能不干涉呢？”麦康伯问妻子。

“你一下子变得异常勇敢了，怪突然的。”他妻子以轻蔑的语气说，但这种语气缺乏底气，像是有很大的顾忌。

麦康伯哈哈大笑了起来，开怀大笑了起来。“我是变了，”他说，“的确变了。”

“这变化是不是来得太晚了些？”玛戈苦涩地说。这许多年来，她已经竭尽全力了。一个巴掌拍不响，目前的状况并不是她一个人造成的。

“对我而言并不晚。”麦康伯说。

玛戈没吱声，又坐回到了角落里。

“你看咱们给它的时间够长的了吧？”麦康伯高高兴兴地问威尔逊。

“可以去看看了。”威尔逊说，“实心弹还有吗？”

“扛枪人那里还有一些。”

威尔逊用斯瓦希里语喊了一声，那个年纪大些的扛枪人正在剥公牛头皮，听见后直起身来，从衣袋里掏出一盒实心弹，走过来递给了麦康伯。麦康伯给弹仓里装满子弹，将剩余的放入了自己的衣袋。

“你可以用斯普林菲尔德步枪打，”威尔逊说，“这是你用惯了的。把这支曼利彻尔步枪留在车上让太太看管。你的扛枪人替你拿上大枪，我自己拿着这‘大炮’。接下来我给你介绍一下情况。”他把这一项放到最后，是不想让麦康伯生出顾虑来，“公牛冲过来时，会把头扬得高高的，端直朝前冲。犄角管护着它的大脑，子弹打不穿。要打只能直接打它的鼻子，还有一处可打的地方是它的胸脯。如果你是在侧面，就打它的脖子或肩膀。一枪没有毙命，要最后结果它可就费事了。你可不要耍什么新花样。找最致命的地方打。他们把牛的头皮剥完了。咱们出发吧？”

他冲着那两个扛枪人喊了一声，两人擦着手走了过来，那个年纪大些的坐到了汽车的尾部。

“我只带康格尼，”威尔逊说，“另一个留下来轰鸟。”

汽车慢慢悠悠穿过开阔的野地，向那片岛屿一样的灌木林开去。那片灌木林看上去形状像舌头，枝叶纵横交错，沿着一条经过洼地的干涸的河道延伸。麦康伯觉得自己的心怦怦乱跳，又一次感到嘴发干，不过不是由于恐惧，而是激动所致。

“它就是从这儿钻进去的。”威尔逊说。接着，他用斯瓦希里语对那个扛枪人说：“顺着血迹朝前找。”

汽车开到与灌木林平行的地方，麦康伯、威尔逊和那个扛枪人一起下了车。麦康伯回头望了望，看见妻子在盯着他瞧，身旁放着那支步枪。他冲她挥了挥手，而对方没有挥手作答。

灌木长得非常稠密，地面干干的。那个中年扛枪人汗流不止。威尔逊朝下压了压帽子，把帽檐遮在眼上方，红红的脖子正好挡在麦康伯的前边。突然，那个扛枪人用斯瓦希里语对威尔逊说了句什么，随后向前跑去。

“牛已经死了，”威尔逊说，“干得漂亮。”说完，他一把抓起了麦康伯的手，两人一边握手一边冲对方咧着嘴微笑。就在这时，耳旁传来了扛枪人的狂呼乱叫声，接着就见他斜刺里从灌木林冲了出来，快得像一阵风，而那只公牛紧随其后，牛鼻子前伸，嘴巴紧闭，鲜血淋漓，巨大的脑袋直直地朝前戳着，猛地冲了过来，眼睛小得似猪眼，布满了血丝，死死盯着他们。走在前边的威尔逊跪下射击，麦康伯也开了一枪，由于威尔逊的枪响声太大，他没有听见自己的枪声，只看到公牛巨大的犄角管碎片纷飞，像是瓦片被击碎了一样。牛头猛地摆了摆，他朝着宽宽的牛鼻孔又开了一枪，却见牛犄角又震动了一下，随之碎片纷飞。此刻，他看不见威尔逊了，只见野牛那庞大的身躯山一样压了过来，便仔细瞄准，又开了一枪。他的枪管几乎快碰到那急速冲过来的牛头和前伸的牛鼻子。他可以看到那双邪恶的小眼睛，接着看见牛头开始下垂。他感到自己的脑袋里猛地白光一闪，火一样热，让人睁不开眼睛——这就是他所有的感觉了。

刚才，威尔逊闪身躲到一旁，朝着公牛的肩膀开了一枪。麦康伯则站在原地，朝牛鼻子开枪，每一次都偏高一些，击中的是沉重的牛犄角，像击中了房瓦一样，打得牛犄角碎片纷飞。麦康伯夫人见牛犄角马上就要戳到丈夫，急忙用那支6.5口径的曼利彻尔步枪向野牛开枪，结果却射中了丈夫，打在了他脑袋底部朝上约两英寸，向旁边稍微偏一些的地方。

此时，弗朗西斯·麦康伯倒了下去，脸朝下，而公牛躺在旁边不到两码的地方。他的妻子跪在他跟前，威尔逊守在她身边。

“我觉得还是不要把他的身子翻过来了。”威尔逊说。

玛戈歇斯底里地痛哭流涕。

“我回车上去。”威尔逊说，“那支步枪在哪里？”

她摇了摇头，面部已经变了形。那个扛枪人把步枪捡了起来。

“把它留在原来的地方！”威尔逊说，“你去把阿卜杜拉找来，让他对事故现场做个见证。”

随后，他跪下来，从衣袋里取出块手帕，盖在弗朗西斯·麦康伯那头发短得像划船手发型一样的脑袋上。鲜血浸入了松软的干土里。

威尔逊立起身子，看了看侧躺着的野牛，见它腿伸得直挺挺的，肚皮上的毛稀稀拉拉，爬满了虱子。“好一只公牛！角距足足有五十英寸，或者更多一些。肯定更多一些！”他的大脑机械地将这只牛记了下来。他把司机叫了来，让司机把一块毯子盖在尸体上，然后守在跟前。接下来，他走到汽车那儿，而那个女人正坐在汽车的角落里哭泣。

“这样也好，”他用一种平淡的声音说，“反正他会离开你的。”

“别说了！”女人说。

“这完全是一次意外的事故。”他仍在说，“这我是知道的。”

“别说了！”女人说。

“别担心。”他又说道，“接下来还会有一连串令人不愉快的事情发生，但我会叫他们拍些照片，验尸的时候会非常有用的。扛枪人和司机也可以提供证词，你肯定不会有事的。”

“别说了！”女人说。

“事情千头万绪，还有许多工作要做呢。”他仍在说，“我得派一辆卡车去湖边发封电报，联系一架飞机接咱们三个去内罗毕。你为什么不用毒药毒死他呢？在英国她们都是这么做的。”

“别说啦！别说啦！别说啦！”女人失声叫了起来。

威尔逊用他那双缺乏感情的蓝眼睛打量着她。

“我的职责算是尽到了。”他说，“我刚才有点生气。我本来开始喜欢上你丈夫了。”

“天呀，求求你别说啦！”女人说，“求求你别说啦！”

“这样才像回事。”威尔逊说，“求人才像回事。现在我就不说了。”

世界之都


在马德里，到处都有叫帕克的男孩，这是“弗朗西斯科”一名的爱称。马德里流传着一则笑话，据说一位父亲来马德里，在《自由报》私人广告栏登了一条启事说：“帕克，星期二来蒙塔纳饭店见我。往事一概不究。——父。”看了启事跑来的年轻人竟有八百人之多，最后叫来一个中队的骑警才把他们驱散。卢阿卡寄宿公寓的餐厅里有个侍者也叫帕克，但他既没有父亲原谅他，也没有过错需要父亲的原谅。他有两个姐姐在卢阿卡当房间服务员，谋得此职得益于同村的一个女子，那女子曾在卢阿卡做服务员，由于干活勤快和待人诚恳为自己的村子以及同村人赢得了好口碑。这两个姐姐给弟弟钱，让他乘汽车来到马德里，为他弄了份侍者学徒的工作。他来自于埃克斯塔马杜拉大区的一个村庄，那儿的生活条件原始得让人无法相信，食物匮乏，使人舒适的享受就更谈不上了。自打记事，他只知道拼命干活。

他体格健美，乌黑乌黑的头发有点卷曲，牙齿雪白，皮肤细腻，叫他的姐姐羡慕不已；平时，他的脸上老挂着明朗的笑容。他做事麻利，把活儿干得有声有色。他爱自己的两个面容美丽、懂得人情世故的姐姐，爱好得仍叫他难以置信的马德里，爱自己的工作——干活时身穿晚礼服，灯火辉煌，餐桌的桌布一尘不染，厨房里食物丰盛，似乎有着浪漫的瑰丽色彩。

在卢阿卡，另外还有八九个或十来个人，他们都来餐厅里吃饭。餐厅里有三个侍者，帕克是最年轻的一个。但在他看来，真正存在的只有那些斗牛士。

这家公寓里住的是些二流斗牛士，因为公寓地处圣哲罗尼莫，位置好，吃的棒，而且食宿费便宜。斗牛士是需要顾面子的，即便不能飞黄腾达，起码也得体面一些，因为体面和尊严比勇气还重要，在西班牙是最有价值的。斗牛士怎么都要住在卢阿卡，直至口袋里的比塞塔(1)全花光。据说，没有一个斗牛士搬出卢阿卡，住进档次更高、更豪华的饭店——二流斗牛士就是二流，永远也不会成为一流的。不过，一旦离开了卢阿卡，他们的境况就会日落西山。凡是能在此处住宿的人都是可以挣些钱的，不自己提出，老板娘绝不会将账单交给客人，除非老板娘知道这位客人已到了山穷水尽的地步。

眼下，卢阿卡住着三个正式的斗牛士，另外还有两位出类拔萃的骑马长枪手和一个优秀的徒步短枪手(2)。这几个长枪手和短枪手家住塞维利亚，春季赛来马德里求宿，住卢阿卡对他们而言算是奢侈的了。不过，他们薪酬高，有固定的职位，雇用他们的斗牛士对于即将到来的赛季全都签订了重金合同。按说，这三个副手不管哪一个都比此处三个斗牛士中的任何一个挣的钱要多得多。三个斗牛士中的一个在生病，却装出一副没病的样子；另一个曾走红过，但那只是昙花一现；第三个则是个懦夫。

这个懦夫曾经天不怕地不怕，技艺高超，可是在作为正式斗牛士参加的第一个赛季，一出场就叫公牛用犄角在小肚子上戳了一下，伤情很重，以后就变得胆小了。他风光的时候气度豪爽，其中许多意气风发的素质保留至今。他谈笑风生，乐呵呵的，不管有没有原因，都时常会哈哈大笑。当年功成名就时，他喜欢搞恶作剧，现在却已放弃了这项娱乐。很可能是没有这份心情了吧。这个斗牛士看上去不乏智慧，有一张坦率的面孔，言谈举止颇有风度。

生病的那位斗牛士处处留意，不让病态显现出来，小心翼翼的，摆上桌的饭菜每一样怎么都要吃上几口。他有许多手帕，而这些手帕他都是在房间里自己洗。最近，他在出售他的斗牛服，圣诞节前低价卖出了一套，四月份的头一个星期又售出了一套。这些衣服原本是很贵重的，一直保存得很好，现在却只剩下一套了。患病之前，他曾经一度前途似锦，是个轰动一时的斗牛士。他目不识丁，却收集了一些剪报，剪报上说他在马德里的初场表演比贝尔蒙特(3)还高一筹。现在，他孤零零一个人守在一张小餐桌旁就餐，很少抬起头来。

那个曾走红过，但名气只是昙花一现的斗牛士，个子矮小，有着黝黑的皮肤，显出一副很尊贵的样子。他也是独自一人在一张单独的餐桌旁吃饭，很少露出笑容，更不用说哈哈大笑了。他的家乡在巴利亚多利德，那里的人都不苟言笑。他是个有本事的斗牛士，然而没等他靠勇敢无畏、镇定自若的优秀素质成功赢得公众的青睐，他的风格就已经过时了。他的名字登在海报上，是绝不会吸引人去观赛的。他的独特之处在于他是个“三寸丁”，矮到连公牛的肩隆都看不到，但身材矮的斗牛士又不止他一个。于是他没有能够持久地吸引住公众的眼球。

长枪手里有个瘦子，长得像老鹰，灰白头发，并不强壮，胳膊腿却硬得似铁棍。他裤管下总穿着一双牧牛人的靴子，每天晚上都灌大量的黄汤，见公寓里出现个女人，便色眯眯盯着看。另一位长枪手是个大块头，肤色黝黑，古铜色脸膛，相貌堂堂，头发黑得像印第安人，一双手似簸箕一样大。两人都是很棒的长枪手。只不过，据说头一个因为酒色过度而能力大减，第二个则刚愎自用，喜欢吵架，跟任何一个斗牛士共事都不会超过一个赛季。

那位短枪手是个中年人，头发霜染，可是尽管有了一把岁数，却敏捷得像只猫。在餐桌旁坐着，他看上去倒有点像个商人，生意经营得不错。这个赛季，他的手脚依然好使。每当用到这副手脚时，他都会运用智慧和经验确保自己受到雇用，而且能长期受到雇用。问题在于：他脚下的速度早晚会变慢的，那是一定会叫他担心的。不过目前，他还是挺有信心的，挺淡定的，无论场内场外均如此。

这天晚上，大家吃完饭都走了，餐厅里只剩下了那个鹰脸长枪手，他喝酒喝多了。另外还有一个脸上印着胎记的生意人和两个加利西亚省来的牧师。这位生意人一旦国内有个节日，都会到集市上拍卖手表，此时也把酒喝过了头。两个牧师坐在墙角的一张餐桌旁，即便喝酒喝得不算过多，肯定也不少了。当时，在卢阿卡，酒钱是含在食宿费里边的。侍者又拎来几瓶瓦尔德帕那葡萄酒，先送到那个拍卖商的桌上，再依次送给长枪手以及那两个牧师。三位侍者均守候在餐厅的一端。

卢阿卡有个规矩：所有的侍者都应该坚守岗位，不等自己负责的客人全部离开餐桌，不得随便走掉。可这一次，负责两个牧师那张餐桌的侍者有个约会，要去参加一个无政府工团主义者会议，帕克答应过为他伺候那张餐桌。

楼上，那个生病的斗牛士脸朝下独自趴在床上。那位风光不再的斗牛士则坐在窗前向外边张望，想出去到咖啡馆散散心。而那个懦夫斗牛士此时把帕克的姐姐扣在自己房间里调情，千方百计想让她如自己的愿，而帕克的姐姐呵呵笑着加以拒绝。斗牛士说：“来吧，小野人。”

“不。”帕克的姐姐说，“我图个什么？”

“行个方便嘛。”

“你酒足饭饱，现在可拿我当餐后点心哟。”

“就这么一次嘛。有什么害处呢？”

“别碰我！我告诉你别碰我！”

“这只不过是小事一桩嘛。”

“我告诉你别碰我！”

在楼下的餐厅里，那个个子最高的侍者此时已误了开会的时间。只听他说道：“瞧那两个黑猪喝酒的样子。”

“不能这样说话，”另一位侍者说，“他们可是体面的顾客，酒又喝得不算太多。”

“我觉得这样说他们没什么不妥当的。”高个子说，“西班牙有两大公害，一是公牛，二是牧师。”

“这当然指的不是具体的某一条公牛和某一个牧师。”另一个侍者说。

“不对。”高个子侍者说，“只有拿个体开刀，才能向整个阶级发动进攻。应该把每一条公牛和每一个牧师斩尽杀绝，一个不剩，那时就再也没有这样的公害了。”

“这种话还是留在开会时说吧。”另一个侍者说。

“瞧瞧马德里的这种不人道的现象吧，”高个子侍者说，“都十一点半了，这些家伙还在大吃大喝。”

“他们是十点钟才开始吃的呀。”另一个侍者说，“你也知道，菜上得挺多，酒又便宜。酒是付过钱的，度数也不高。”

“有你这样的傻瓜，工人阶级怎么能团结在一起呢？”高个子侍者问。

“听着，”这另一个侍者已到了知天命的年纪，此时只听他回话说，“我干了一辈子活，后半生还要继续干活。对此，我没有什么牢骚话。干活是天经地义的事情。”

“不错，可你不干活是活不下去的。”

“所以我一直在干。”这位年纪稍大些的侍者说，“你去开你的会吧，没必要守在这里了。”

“你是个好同志，”高个子侍者说，“但就是缺乏思想。”

“Mejor si me falta eso que el otro(4)，”年纪稍大些的侍者说（意思是缺思想总比缺活干好），“去开你的会吧。”

帕克一句话也没说过。他不懂政治，但听到高个子侍者提到要把牧师和警察斩尽杀绝，不由热血沸腾。在他看来，高个子侍者代表的是革命，而革命具有浪漫的色彩。他本人很想成为一名虔诚的天主教徒，成为一名革命者；他既想有一份这样的稳定工作，又想当一个斗牛士。

“去开会吧，伊格纳西奥。”他说，“你的活我替你负责干。”

“我们两个替你干。”年纪稍大些的侍者说。

“一个人就足够了。”帕克说，“开会去吧。”

“好吧，那我就走了。(5)”高个子侍者说，“谢谢喽。”

就在这个时候，帕克的姐姐在楼上从那个斗牛士的怀里挣脱开，动作巧妙得就跟摔跤运动员摆脱了对手的纠缠一样，怒容满面地说：“都是些饿狼似的人。你当斗牛士是个窝囊废，胆小如鼠。你有本事，就到斗牛场上露一手呀。”

“你个婊子，怎么这么说话！”

“婊子也是人。再说，我也不是个婊子。”

“你会成为婊子的。”

“再怎么也不跟你干那种事。”

“你走吧。”斗牛士说。由于遭到拒绝和驳斥，他顿感懦夫的本性又回到了他身上。

“让我走？你还有什么本事呢？”帕克的姐姐说，“你难道不想让我为你把床铺好吗？我拿薪酬是干这种活儿的。”

“你走吧。”斗牛士又说了一声。他那张宽宽的英俊的脸都变了形，皱成了一团，像是要哭了。“走吧，你个婊子，你个臭婊子。”

“好吧，斗牛士，”帕克的姐姐走时，一边随手将门关上一边说道，“好吧，我的斗牛士。”

在房间里，这位斗牛士坐在床上，面部仍扭曲着。斗牛时，他往往会在这张脸上堆起笑容，叫坐在头排的观众看了担忧，因为他们看得出那笑容里包含着怎样的酸楚。“竟然到了这样的地步。”他想着想着说出了声，“竟然到了这样的地步。竟然到了这样的地步。”

他曾经风光一时，对此他仍记忆犹新。那只不过是三年前的事情。他记得那是在一个五月份的炎热的下午出的事。当时他穿着沉甸甸的金色锦缎斗牛服，在斗牛场上说话的声音跟他在咖啡馆时一样充满了自信，记得刺杀牛时，自己的目光顺着剑锋望去，瞄准了公牛两肩中间突起的地方，那儿蒙着灰尘，是一团黑色的长着短毛的隆起的肌肉，而下首便是低垂的牛角——那牛角宽宽的，尖端已经裂开，冲锋时能把树木撞倒。他记得他把剑刺进了牛的身体，容易得就像刺进了一块硬硬的奶酪里，手掌用力推剑柄，左胳膊弯得低低的，左肩膀前倾，全身的重量压在左腿上，后来重心突然偏移，转移到了小肚子上——公牛抬起了头，将犄角刺进了他的小肚子里。他被犄角顶起甩了两下，才被人们救了下来。现在，他刺杀公牛时，这种机会已经不多，十有八九都会不由自主地先胆怯地望望牛的犄角。投入战斗之前便有了畏怯之心，这种窘态一个婊子是怎么知道的呢？这些人竟然耻笑他，心里不知怎么想的呢！婊子毕竟是婊子，懂得怎样利用这一点做做文章。

此时在楼下的餐厅里，那个长枪手在盯着两位牧师瞧。如果餐厅里有女人，他就看女人，没有女人，便看看外国人，看看一个英国人(6)取乐子。可是此时跟前既没有女人又没有外国人，他就乐滋滋、厚颜无礼地盯着那两个牧师瞧了。就在他乱张望之际，那个脸上有胎记的拍卖商立起了身，将餐巾一折，走了出去。他要的最后一瓶酒还有一半没有喝完。假如在卢阿卡需要付酒账，那他一定会喝得一滴不剩的。

话说那两个牧师，他们却没有向长枪手这边张望。只听他们当中的一个在说：“我等着见到他，已经有十天之久了。我在接待室一待就是一整天，可他始终不肯见我。”

“该怎么办好呢？”

“没办法。有什么办法呢？当权的就是当权的，你拿他们一点办法都没有。”

“我来这儿两个星期了，也是一点办法都没有。我等来等去，他们硬是不肯见。”

“谁叫咱们来自荒郊僻壤呢。钱花光了，咱们还是回去吧。”

“又要回那个荒僻的地方了。加利西亚是死是活，马德里才不管呢！咱们那儿可是个穷省。”

“巴西利奥兄弟采取的行动是可以理解的。”

“不过，我对巴西利奥·阿尔瓦雷斯的人格还是缺乏真正的信心。”

“到了马德里就学聪明了。这地方会扼杀西班牙的。”

“他们应该见见咱们呀，哪怕拒绝也行。”

“没门呀。他们得叫你等得身心疲惫、精神崩溃。”

“好呀，那就瞧着吧。别人等得了，我也等得了。”

就在这时，那个灰白头发、长得像老鹰的长枪手站起身子走了过来，立在两个牧师的餐桌跟前，眼睛看着他们微微一笑。

“是个斗牛士。”一位牧师对同伴说。

“是一个优秀的斗牛士哩。”长枪手说了一声，走出了餐厅。只见他上穿灰色夹克衫，下穿紧身马裤，足蹬高跟的牧牛人皮靴，腰身紧凑，弓形腿，一边微笑一边迈开稳健的大步朝外走，皮靴踩在地板上咯吱咯吱响。他生活在一个狭小、封闭的职业圈子里，讲究的是个人能力。在这个圈子里，他志得意满、目中无人，夜夜酗酒寻乐子。来到过厅里，他点起一支雪茄烟，将帽子向一边歪了歪，然后出门去咖啡馆了。

长枪手一走，两个牧师很快也离开了。他们意识到餐厅里只剩下他们两个客人，才慌慌张张走掉了。人去屋空，这下子餐厅里只有帕克以及那个中年侍者两人了。两人收拾好餐桌，把酒送进了厨房。

负责洗碗碟的小伙子正在厨房里忙活。他比帕克大三岁，愤世嫉俗，为人很刻薄。

“来喝一杯。”中年侍者说完，斟了一杯瓦尔德帕那葡萄酒递给了他。

“有酒为什么不喝！”小伙子把酒杯接了过去说。

“你(7)，帕克？”中年侍者问。

“我也来一杯吧。谢谢。”帕克说。

三个人把杯里的酒一饮而尽。

“我要走了。”中年侍者说。

“晚安。”他的同伴们说。

中年侍者走了，只剩下帕克他们俩了。帕克拿起一条牧师用过的餐巾，站直身子，脚后跟立定，然后将餐巾放低，头也顺势放低，摆动胳膊，来了一个斗牛士抖动披风的动作，样子从容舒缓。接着，他一个转身，右脚向前轻移，又抖了一下餐巾，面对假想中的公牛占据了一个比较有利的位置，随后又抖了抖餐巾，动作舒缓、优雅，时间掌握得恰到好处。最后，他收起餐巾，将其放至腰部，一闪身，算是躲过了冲过来的公牛。

洗碗工名叫恩里克，在一旁用挑剔和嘲笑的目光观看他表演。

“你的那条公牛怎么样？”他末了问道。

“非常勇敢。”帕克说，“你看这里。”

他说完站直细细的腰身，又完美地连着做了四个抖披风的动作，如行云流水，潇洒、优雅。

“公牛怎么样呢？”恩里克靠洗碗槽站着，手里端着酒杯，腰上系着围裙。

“底气仍然很足呢。”帕克说。

“你叫我恶心。”恩里克说。

“为什么？”

“你瞧我的。”

恩里克说完解下围裙，用它引着假想中的公牛冲过来，做了四个完美的抖披风的动作，像吉卜赛人表演那样自如。最后，他一甩围裙，躲开公牛，让围裙形成一个硬硬的弧度掠过公牛的鼻子。

“你瞧瞧这套动作吧。”他说，“谁想得到我却是个洗碗工。”

“为何不去斗牛呢？”

“害怕呗。”恩里克说，“是因为害怕(8)。走上斗牛场，面对一条真的公牛，你也会同样感到害怕的。”

“不会的，”帕克说，“我不会害怕的。”

“去你的！(9)”恩里克说，“谁遇上都会害怕的。只不过斗牛士能够控制内心的恐惧感罢了，那样才能斗得好牛嘛。我参加过一场业余斗牛赛，当时吓得不得了，不由自主掉头便跑。人人都觉得这挺滑稽的。换上你，也会害怕的。要不是因为害怕，在西班牙就连擦鞋匠也可以当斗牛士。你，一个乡下人，一定会比我更害怕的。”

“没有的事。”帕克说。

在想象中，他已经有过许多次斗牛的经历了。他看见牛的犄角、湿湿的牛鼻子和扑闪的牛耳朵不知有多少次了；他看见公牛低头冲过来，牛蹄子把地面踏得嗵嗵响，而他一抖披风，让发了疯的公牛从身边冲过；接着，他一次又一次抖披风，引得公牛一次又一次冲锋；最后，他潇洒地来了个大回转，引得公牛围着他团团转。当他大模大样走开时，他那夹克衫的金色饰品上由于擦着了牛身子而粘了几根牛毛，公牛傻呆呆站在那儿，像中了催眠术，观众欢声雷动。不，他绝不会害怕的。别人会害怕，但他是绝对不会的。对此他胸中有数。退一万步来说，即便害怕，他也可以应付的。对此，他信心百倍。于是他说：“我是绝对不会害怕的！”

恩里克又说了一声：“去你的！(10)”

接下来，他建议道：“是不是需要试一试？”

“怎么试？”

“你看，”恩里克说，“你心里光想到了公牛，却没有想到牛角。公牛力大无穷，它的犄角锋利似刀剑，戳人像刺刀，又像铁棒一样可以一击毙命。你瞧瞧这个。”他说着将桌子的一个抽屉拉开，取出两把切肉刀来，“我把刀绑在椅子腿上，再将椅子举在头前边给你扮演公牛。假如你还能像刚才那样来那么几手，那才是好样的呢。”

“你把围裙借给我，”帕克说，“咱们到餐厅表演去。”

“算啦，”恩里克突然变得不那么刻薄了，这样说道，“别表演了，帕克。”

“要表演的，”帕克说，“我才不害怕呢。”

“看见刀子刺过来，你就怕了。”

“等着瞧。”帕克说，“你把围裙给我。”

恩里克动手拿两条用过的餐巾将切肉刀的刀身绑在椅子腿上，固定牢，绑死，然后打了结。切肉刀沉甸甸的，跟剃刀一般锋利。与此同时，帕克的那两个房间服务员姐姐正走在去电影院的路上，要去看葛丽泰·嘉宝主演的《安娜·克丽丝蒂》。至于那两个牧师，一个身穿内衣在念祈祷书，另一个则穿着睡衣在诵读玫瑰经。除了那个生病的斗牛士，其他的斗牛士晚间均去了福尔诺斯咖啡馆。在咖啡馆里，那个深色头发的大块头长枪手在打弹子，而那位表情严肃的矮个子斗牛士坐在拥挤的桌旁，前边放着一杯牛奶咖啡，身边坐的是那位中年短枪手，另外还有几个不苟言笑的工人。

那个喜欢喝酒的灰白头发长枪手也坐在一张桌子旁，面前放着一杯卡扎拉斯白兰地，兴致勃勃地望着另一张桌子——那个丧失了勇气的斗牛士和另外的一个弃剑而重新改用短枪的斗牛士坐在那儿，身边坐着两个面容憔悴的烟花女子。

至于拍卖商，则站在街角跟朋友谈天说地。那位高个子侍者已到了无政府工团主义者的会场，在等待机会发言。此时，那个中年侍者正坐在阿尔瓦雷斯咖啡馆的平台上端着一小杯啤酒细品慢咽。卢阿卡寄宿公寓的老板娘已入梦乡，仰面躺着，把长枕夹在两腿之间。她人高马大，性格诚实，心地纯净，为人随和，笃信宗教，没有一天不思念已过世二十年的丈夫，没有一天不为亡夫祈祷。那个生病的斗牛士独自一人待在房间里，脸朝下平趴在床上，嘴巴下垫着一块手帕。

此刻，卢阿卡的餐厅已人去屋空。恩里克用餐巾将厨刀绑在椅子腿上，把最后的一个结打好，然后举起了椅子。他把绑着厨刀的椅子腿向前一戳，将椅子举过头顶，两把刀一左一右，直挺挺指向前方。

“挺沉的。”他开口说道，“听我一言，帕克。这太危险了，还是别表演了吧。”他说着话，脸上淌下了汗珠。

帕克面对着他站着，将围裙展开，拇指朝上，食指向下，用两手把围裙捏紧，然后抖了抖以吸引“公牛”的目光。

“冲过来吧，”他说，“像公牛一样该转身就转身。你想冲多少次都可以。”

“你怎么知道何时抖披风何时停呢？”恩里克问，“最好先试三个回合，然后中间休息片刻。”

“那好吧。”恩里克说，“冲过来吧。冲呀，小公牛(11)！来呀，小公牛！”

恩里克把头一低朝他冲了过来。帕克眼见刀锋到了跟前，便将围裙一抖，让刀子从他的肚皮前划了过去。对于他，那刀子就是真实的牛角，黑颜色，白白的尖，光滑光滑，而与他擦身而过，转身又冲过来的恩里克则是公牛，身躯庞大、滚烫，腰上鲜血淋漓——那“公牛”嗵嗵嗵地冲过去，然后猫一样敏捷地转过身子，见他慢慢一抖“披风”，就又冲了过来。接着，“公牛”又冲了一次。这一次，他望着那刺过来的刀尖，急忙向前迈出左脚，结果多迈出了两英寸，刀子没有躲过去，而是扎进了他的身体，轻轻易易就扎了进去，就像扎进了酒囊一样容易。坚硬的钢刀扎了进去，滚烫的鲜血顺着刀身的上面以及周围泉涌而出。恩里克大叫一声：“哎呀！哎呀！快让我拔出来！快让我拔出来！”帕克向前一栽，栽在了椅子上，手里仍抓着那条围裙披风。恩里克拽着椅子，于是那刀子在帕克的体内转了一下，又转了一下。

刀子拔了出来，而帕克一屁股坐在了地板上，身下的血流成了河，温温的，越来越多。

“快用餐巾捂住伤口。快捂住！”恩里克说，“你可要捂紧。我去喊医生来。千万要捂紧，别让血流出来。”

“跟前有个皮碗就好了。”帕克说。他曾在斗牛场上见过那种东西。

“都怪我冲得太猛了。”恩里克带着哭腔说，“我只是想让你看看这种表演有多危险。”

“别担心，”帕克用一种听上去很微弱的声音说道，“你去把医生叫来就是了。”

在斗牛场上遇到这样的情况，他们会把你抬起来快快离去，送你到手术室去。如果没到手术室你股动脉里的血就流光了，他们便直接请牧师来。

“再请一个牧师过来！”帕克一边把餐巾紧紧捂在受伤的小肚子上，一边说道。他简直无法相信这样的事情竟然发生在了自己身上。

可是恩里克没听见他的话，而早已顺着圣杰罗尼莫赛马场跑了，朝着通宵服务的急救站狂奔。屋里只剩下了帕克一人，他先还是直坐着，后来蜷缩起来，最终瘫倒在了地上，直至一切结束。他感到生命在离他而去，就像拔掉了浴缸里的塞子，缸里的水在渐渐流尽。他害怕了，感到一阵眩晕，鼓起劲想说几句忏悔词。他记得忏悔的开场白是这样的：“上帝啊，我对自己的过错深表痛心。我爱你，全心全意地爱你，下定决心……”他的语速很快，但没等他把忏悔词说完，就感到头晕目眩，一头栽倒在地板上，很快没有了生命。股动脉一旦割断，里面的血就会流光，简直快得惊人。

当急救站的医生和一个警察（那警察紧紧抓住恩里克的胳膊）相伴赶到时，帕克的两个姐姐仍在格兰维亚大街的电影院里看电影。嘉宝主演的这部电影让两人大失所望，因为在这个大明星主演的片子中，周围的环境一般都豪华奢侈、金碧辉煌，可是这部电影里的环境却寒酸、凄凉。由于对电影强烈不满，观众们又是吹口哨又是跺脚以示抗议。至于卢阿卡寄宿公寓的其他人，在事故发生时，都在干着之前一直在干的事情。只有那两个牧师做完了祈祷，正准备睡觉。灰白头发的长枪手端着酒杯走过去，和那两个面容憔悴的烟花女子坐在了一起。过了一会儿，他带着其中的一个走出了咖啡馆。而这位烟花女子刚才喝的酒，一直都是那个失去了勇气的斗牛士为她埋的单。

这些人究竟在干些什么，第二天以及以后的日子会干些什么，帕克永远都不会知道了。他不会知道这些人的一生究竟过得怎么样，他们的生命是怎样完结的。他甚至都没有意识到，他们的生命已经完结了。正如一句西班牙的谚语所说的，他是抱着幻想死去的。生前，他没来得及经历幻想破灭的过程，生命结束时甚至都没有来得及把一套忏悔词念完。嘉宝主演的这部电影让马德里整整失望了一个星期，而他生前甚至都没来得及表达自己的失望之情。

乞力马扎罗的雪


乞力马扎罗(1)是一座雪山，高达19710英尺，据说是非洲最高的山。乞力马扎罗的西峰被马赛人(2)叫作“恩嘉琪-恩嘉怡”，意思即“上帝的殿堂”。在靠近西峰的地方有一具已经风干冻僵的豹子尸体。至于豹子为什么要来这么高的地方，无人做过解释。

“奇妙之处就在于没有疼痛感。”他说，“发作的时候就是这么一种状况。”

“真的吗？”

“当然是真的。不过，气味太难闻，真是抱歉得很。一定叫你感到不舒服了。”

“别这么说！求你别这么说！”

“你瞧它们！”他说，“到底是看见了我，还是这气味把它们招来了？”

说话的男子躲在一棵含羞草乔木如盖的浓荫里，躺在一张小床上，目光穿过阴凉地，投向亮晃晃的平原上，那儿有三只大鸟虎视眈眈守候着，另外还有十来只盘旋在空中，掠过时在地上投下一道道影子。

“自从卡车抛锚的那天起，它们就一直盘旋不去。”他说，“今天这是第一次有几只落在了地面上。它们在天上飞，我起初用心观察过它们飞翔的姿势，想着以后说不定写东西能用得上，现在说来怪可笑的。”

“但愿别写它们。”她说。

“只不过随便说说罢了。”他说，“说说话，感觉能轻松许多。不过，我可不想让你心烦哟。”

“不会让我心烦，这你是知道的。”她说，“不心烦，只是内心却极其不安，因为我一点忙都帮不上。想来想去，还是把日子尽量过得轻松些，等着飞机来吧。”

“或者说就这么等下去，飞机压根就不来了。”

“请你吩咐，看我能做些什么。总有我力所能及的事的。”

“你可以把我的腿截掉，让我少受洋罪，虽然我对此持怀疑态度。或者开枪把我一枪崩掉。你现在打枪可是个好手了。起初还是我教你打枪的哩，对不对？”

“请别说这么晦气的话。难道我就不能给你读读书解闷吗？”

“读什么书？”

“书包里的书，只要没看过，哪本都可以呀。”

“我怕是听不进去。”他说，“耍耍嘴皮子倒是最轻松。咱们打打口水仗吧，那样来消磨时间。”

“我才不和你拌嘴呢。吵架我是绝对不愿意的。从今往后咱们就不要打什么口水仗了。不管心里有多么烦躁，都不应该吵架。也许，他们今天又会另弄一辆卡车来的。说不定飞机也会来的。”

“我可不想转移了。”男子说，“现在转移已经没有任何意义了，除非能让你感觉好受些。”

“那可是懦夫说的话。”

“一个人快死了，你就不能别骂他了，让他死得舒心一些吗？你这么抹黑我，又有什么意思呢？”

“你不会死的。”

“别犯傻了。我正在死去。不然你去问问那些杂种。”他说着向大鸟那边瞅了一眼，只见那三只肮脏的大鸟把光秃秃的脑袋缩起来，缩进耸立的羽毛里。另有一只从天而降，落地后紧跑几步，然后慢慢悠悠朝着同伴们的跟前走去。

“每个营地都有这种鸟，只是你从来不注意罢了。只要不放弃希望，你就不会死。”

“这样的论断，你是从哪本书上看到的？你可真是傻得不透气。”

“你应该也为别人考虑考虑。”

“看在基督的分上，”他说，“我历来都是把别人装在心里的。”

他躺在床上，沉默了一会儿，让目光越过平原上一闪一闪的滚滚热浪，飘向灌木林的边缘。黄色的平原上有几只野羊，白白的，小小的，远处的灌木林那边有一群斑马，在绿叶的映衬下显得白乎乎一片。他们的营地扎在参天大树之下，背依山丘，水源充足，是个很舒适的营地，不远处有一个快干涸了的水坑，早晨总有沙鸡在那儿飞来飞去的。

“想让我为你读上几页书吗？”她问。她正坐在他床边的一把帆布椅子上。“起风了。”

“不用了，谢谢。”

“也许会有卡车来的。”

“我才不在乎什么卡车不卡车呢。”

“我在乎。”

“你在乎的东西多如牛毛，而我都不在乎。”

“并不是很多的，哈里。”

“喝上一杯怎么样？”

“喝酒对健康不好。布莱克(3)的书里说得好，要远离一切酒精。所以，你不应该喝酒。”

“莫洛！”他喊了一声。

“在，先生！”

“拿威士忌加苏打水来。”

“遵命，先生。”

“劝你不要喝了。”她说，“这就是我所谓的‘放弃希望’。书上都说了对健康不好。我很清楚，喝酒对你是有害的。”

“言之差矣，”他说，“喝酒对我是有好处的。”

他心想，好啦，这下结束了。要不然，他们会喋喋不休争论个没完。为喝杯酒拌嘴，最后来个了断。自从右腿生了坏疽，他就没有了疼痛感，随着疼痛感消失的还有恐惧感，现在只剩下沉重的疲倦感和愤怒感——他没想到会落得这么个下场。对于这样的结局，以及结局就这样到来，他并不感到奇怪。多年来，它一直纠缠着他的心，可现在它出现了，他反倒不在乎了。事情就这么怪：疲倦过了头，便什么都不在乎了。

他原来收集了些素材，打算等掌握了足够的资料，确保能写好的时候再动笔，现在却永远也写不成了。是啊，他可不愿写上几段，就尝到失败的滋味。也许，他压根就写不了，所以才一拖再拖，迟迟没有动笔。其中的原因，只有鬼才知道。

“真后悔跑到了这鬼地方。”女人说。她瞥了一眼他那端着酒杯的手，芳唇紧咬。“在巴黎，绝不会出这样的事。你老是说你喜欢巴黎。咱们完全可以留在巴黎或者到哪个别的地方去。就是天涯海角，我也愿意随你去的。我曾说过，你去哪儿，我就去哪儿。如果你想打猎，那咱们就去匈牙利打猎好啦，那儿会很舒适的。”

“你不就是有些臭钱嘛。”他说。

“这话说得可不公平。”她说，“我的钱，也就是你的钱。我舍弃了一切，跟随你到你想去的地方，做你想做的事情。但话又说回来，我还是后悔跑到了这鬼地方。”

“你说过你喜欢这儿。”

“你没出事之前，我的确这么说过。可现在我讨厌这里。真不明白为什么这样的事偏偏发生在你的腿上。咱们究竟做错了什么，竟然有这样飞来的横祸？”

“恐怕都怪我自己，怪我忘了给伤口涂碘酒，就用手抓那儿搔痒。对此我没有经心，因为我从未有过伤口感染的情况。后来，这伤情就恶化了。其他杀菌剂都用完了，可能因为随便涂了些药性差的石炭酸溶液，结果令微血管出了问题，引发了坏疽。”他说着看了看她，“除此之外，还会有什么呢？”

“我指的不是这个。”

“当初要是雇个懂行的把式，而不是个半吊子基库尤人(4)司机，他就会检查检查机油，绝不会让卡车的轴承烧坏。”

“我指的不是这个。”

“假如你没有离开你那社交圈子，没有离开老韦斯特伯里、萨拉托加以及棕榈滩(5)的那些狐朋狗友，而把我收在了囊中……”

“说什么呀，我是爱你的。这样对我是不公平的。我过去爱你，现在爱你，以后还会永远地爱你。难道你不爱我吗？”

“不爱，”男子说，“恐怕是这样的。我从来就没有爱过你。”

“哈里，你在说什么呀？你简直是昏了头了。”

“不，我已经没有头可昏的了。”

“别喝酒了。”她说，“亲爱的，求你别喝酒了。咱们应该做出一切努力，共渡难关。”

“要努力你自己努力吧，”他说，“我已经精疲力竭了。”

在脑海里，他看见了卡拉伽奇的一个火车站，看见他背着行囊站在那里，辛普伦东方快车的车灯划破了黑暗——大撤退之后，他正要离开色雷斯。这是一段情景，他准备以后写作时用。另外还有一段情景是这样的：吃早饭时，他凭窗远眺，只见保加利亚群山上白雪皑皑；南森(6)的女秘书问老人那是不是雪，老人看了看说不是的，说那不是雪，还不到下雪的时候呢。女秘书把这话给其他几个女孩子讲了，那些人都承认自己看走了眼，说那的确不是雪。其实，那是雪，一点都不假。等到交换难民，他送她们进山，走到了雪地上。那年冬天，她们踩着积雪走啊走，直至最后倒地死去。

话说同一年过圣诞节的那一周，高尔泰山也在下雪，纷纷扬扬一个劲在下。他们住在伐木工的小屋里，这儿的空间被一个硕大的四四方方的瓷砖炉子占了一半。大家睡的褥垫里装的是山毛榉树叶。这时，那个逃兵跑了来，脚上淌着血，在雪地里留下了痕迹。他说宪兵就在身后追捕他。大家让他换了双毛袜子，宪兵来了就拉着他们胡扯，直至大雪盖住了逃兵的足印。

在舒茨，过圣诞节的那天，白雪亮晃晃的，刺得人眼疼。从旅馆向外看，可以看见人们做完祈祷，从教堂纷纷返回自己的家中。在这个地方，他们肩扛沉重的滑雪板，沿着河岸旁的那条尿黄色的平展的滑雪道攀上松林覆盖的陡峭山坡，然后从耸立在马德莱纳旅馆旁的那座雪山上踩着滑雪板一阵风似的冲下来，雪地平展得像一块涂了糖霜的蛋糕，雪花轻盈得似粉末。他们一路滑行，风驰电掣，无声无息，如鸟儿从天而降。对于这些，他仍记忆犹新。

当时他们住在马德莱纳旅馆，由于暴风雪的缘故受困于此达一个星期之久，整天都借着提灯的灯光在烟雾缭绕的屋子里打扑克解闷。兰特先生输得越惨，赌注下得越高。最后，他输了个精光，输掉了滑雪学校的钱，输掉了本季度的盈利，连资金也输掉了。他仍可以看到当时的情景——大鼻子兰特先生捡起几张牌，然后摊开说：“我不跟。”他们整天地赌，不下雪时赌，雪下得太多还赌。他想了想，觉得自己一生中花在赌博上的时间真是太多了。

不过，对于这些，他在写作时只字未提，也没有提那个寒冷、晴朗的圣诞日。那一天，目光穿越平原，可以看见对面的群山。巴克驾机飞越防线去轰炸运送休假的奥地利军官的列车，见那些军官抱头鼠窜，便用机枪扫射他们。记得巴克走进食堂吃饭时，提起了这事，食堂里顿时鸦雀无声。后来不知谁说了一句：“你这个杀人不眨眼的家伙。”

巴克杀死的也许就是前不久跟他在一起滑雪的奥地利人。不，不是的。那年，跟他一起滑雪的奥地利人叫汉斯，属于皇家狩猎队的成员。他们一起到锯木厂跟前的那个山谷猎杀野兔，途中聊起了帕苏比奥战役以及波提卡拉和阿萨洛纳的那场进攻战。这些他在写作时都只字未提。至于在蒙特·克罗纳、赛特·科穆尼和阿西埃罗的那些经历，他也只字未提。

他在沃拉堡和阿尔堡究竟度过了几个冬天呢？总共四个！他记起了和那个卖狐狸的人在一起的情形，记得他们一起到布卢登茨去。他是去买礼品的。他记得樱桃酒醇香可口，记得怎样在冰天雪地里飞驰，激起团团雪粉，嘴里高唱：“嗨哟！罗利是这么说！”记得穿过最后一片开阔地，冲下陡坡，然后直直朝前滑。进果园转三个弯，出果园后越过水沟，就到了客栈后边的那条冰雪覆盖的路。然后，解开滑雪板上的绳子，把滑雪板从脚上踢下来，将它们靠在客栈的木板墙上。灯光从窗口泻出；屋里烟雾缭绕，新酿的酒芳香扑鼻，给人以阵阵暖意；手风琴声袅袅绕梁。

“去巴黎住哪个地方？”他问坐在身旁一把帆布椅子上的女人。此时，他们这是在非洲。

“住科里伦酒店。那地方你是知道的。”

“我怎么会知道？”

“咱们每次都住那儿呀。”

“不对。不是每次都住那里。”

“反正在那里住过吧，还住过圣日耳曼区的亨利四世大厦。你曾说你爱那个地方。”

“爱只不过是一堆粪，而我是站在粪堆上打鸣的公鸡。”

“假如你不得不离开人世，”她说，“是不是需要在走之前把所有的一切都毁掉？我是说一点东西也不留？你是不是必须宰马杀妻，将马鞍和盔甲付之一炬？”

“是的。”他说，“你的臭钱就是我的盔甲，是我的斯威夫特和阿穆尔(7)。”

“求你别这样了！”

“好吧，我就不多说了。我并不想伤你的心。”

“现在怕是有点晚了。”

“那好，那我就继续伤你的心好啦。这样倒更有趣味。这是我真心想做的一件事，现在却做不成了。”

“不，这不是事实。你想做的事情多得很呢，而每一件都是我想做的。”

“噢，看在基督的分上，别再吹牛了好吗？”

他看了她一眼，见她在暗自落泪。

“你听我说，”他说道，“你以为这样说话能给人以乐趣吗？真不知道我为什么要这样。大概是鬼迷心窍，觉得刺伤别人才能使自己活下去吧。刚开始的时候，我还是好好的。惹你伤感并非我的本意。这下子，我成了地地道道的傻瓜，竟然狠下心这样对待你。我的话你权当放屁，别往心里去哟，亲爱的。其实，我是爱你的。我爱你，这你心里是清楚的。我从来没有像爱你这样爱过任何别的人。”

他不知不觉又故技重演，信口雌黄地编造起谎话来。

“你对我挺贴心的。”

“你这个坏婆娘，一个有钱的坏婆娘。”他说，“我这是在作诗。我现在满肚子都是诗句。发腐的诗，发臭的诗！”

“别这样。你为什么非得把自己变成一个魔鬼呢，哈里？”

“因为在死之前，我要毁掉一切，”男子说，“身后什么东西都不愿意留下。”




已经到了傍晚时分。他睡了一大觉。太阳躲到了山后，平原上影影绰绰，一片朦胧。一些小动物在靠近营地的地方觅食。他观望着它们，见它们已远离灌木林，脑袋很快地一起一伏，将尾巴摆来摆去。那些大鸟已不在地面上等候了，而是一只只全都重重地压在了一棵树上。它们的数量还不止这些呢。他的贴身杂役坐在床的旁边。

“太太打猎去了。”杂役说，“先生需要什么吗？”

“什么都不需要。”

她到别处打猎去了。她知道他喜欢看狩猎的场面，所以才跑得远远的，为的是不惊扰他跟前的这一小块清静之地。她可真是处处为他着想。无论是知道些什么，在书上看到些什么，或者听到了什么消息，她心里总是为他着想。

当初他找她时，已经到了无可救药的地步，说什么也不能怪她。你口是心非、谎话连篇，叫一个女人怎么辨得清呢？他谎言脱口而出，完全是出于习惯，只图个方便！自从他言不由衷之日起，他在情场上如鱼得水，比说实话时还要风光。

与其说他愿意撒谎，倒不如说他没有实话可讲。他原来也堂堂正正地做人，现在却成了潦倒之人，生活成了苟延残喘，今天攀这个高枝，明天攀那个高枝，四处游乐，满世界地跑。

你不让自己想这些烦心事，而这是你的了不起之处。只要有一副笃定的心肠，就不会像大多数同样处境的人那样一朝崩溃。你大势已去，昨日的风光已不复存在，文采尽失，而你摆出一副全然不在乎的架势。可是在内心，你却声称一定要写写周围的人，写写那些有钱的人，声称自己没有与他们同流合污，而只是潜伏在他们国家的一个间谍，早晚都会离开他们，把东西写出来，那时的你就是一个了解内幕的人，会是不俗的手笔。可惜这一心愿他永远也无法实现了，因为他每一日都懒于动笔，只贪图眼前的安乐，过着一种自己所鄙视的醉生梦死的生活，渐渐笔锋呆滞，意志消退，最终无所事事，什么都不写了。他不写作了，跟狐朋狗友胡混，倒落了个自自在在。非洲是块福地，他在此处度过了人生中最快活的一段时光——他来这儿是要把日子重新过起。这次狩猎，安逸的程度是极低的。虽然并不艰苦，但也没有奢华可言。他觉得这样也算是重返训练场上，可以将心里的脂肪去掉，就像一个拳击手要去掉身体上的脂肪，得到山里苦练一样。

她喜欢这次狩猎，说她喜欢得不得了。凡是有刺激性的事她都喜欢——换换环境，结交结交新的朋友，看看赏心悦目的景色。他甚至产生了错觉，认为自己又意气风发，有了写作的意愿。可结果并非如此，他心里很清楚。事已至此，他也不必破罐子破摔，像一条断了脊梁的蛇一样自残。错不在这个女人的身上。这个女人没错，那就是别的女人的错。如果说他靠撒谎苟延残喘，那就让他因为撒谎而死去吧。想到这里，他听见山后传来了一声枪响。

她的枪法很好。这个富婆，既呵护着他的天赋，又毁掉了他的天赋。鬼话！毁掉他天赋的罪魁正是他自己！为什么要嫁祸于人，怪罪这个把他照料得无微不至的女人呢？他毁掉了自己的天赋，因为他弃而不用，让天赋生了锈，因为他背叛了自己的灵魂和信仰，因为他酗酒过度使观察力不再敏锐，因为他懒惰成性，因为他势利、傲慢、充满偏见，还因为他蝇营狗苟、投机钻营。这算干什么？难道是在写一本书的目录不成？他有天赋固然不错，但他没有加以利用，而是拿来做交易了。他根本不在意自己写了些什么，而在意能换取些什么。他做出了选择，选择放弃笔耕，而靠别的本事谋生。他爱上的女人一个比一个有钱，你说怪不怪？可是，后来他没有了爱情，只有满口的谎言，就像对这个女人一般——这个女人比他所有的情人都有钱，钱简直多得不得了。她曾有过丈夫和孩子，有过情人，只是对情人们不满意，偏偏钟情于他，觉得他是个作家，一个男子汉，一个伙伴，一个令人感到自豪的宝贝。奇怪的是，他根本不爱她，而且对她撒谎，可这产生的效果更好，更能够回报她为他付出的钱财。

他觉得人的命天注定，是怎样一块料都是有定数的。不管靠什么谋生，其中都包含着天赋的因素。他终生出卖自己的能力，形式各异，当感情投入不太多的时候，在换取金钱方面产生的价值会大得多。这是他的一大发现，但他绝不会写出来。不，他绝不会将其付诸笔端，尽管这值得一书。

就在这时，她出现在了视野里，穿过空地向营地走来。她穿着马裤，背着她的那杆步枪。两个杂役扛着一只野羊，紧随其后。他觉得她仍然有几分风韵，肉体能给人以欢愉。对于床笫之间的风流，她具有出众的才华和欣赏力。她并不漂亮，但他喜欢她的脸蛋。她博览群书，喜欢骑射，当然喝酒喝得极其多。当她还是个比较年轻的少妇时，丈夫便离开了人世。一时间，她把所有的心思都放在了两个刚刚成年的孩子身上，放在了骑马、读书和喝酒上。其实，她的两个孩子并不需要她，有她在跟前反而不自在。她喜欢在傍晚时分读书，在晚餐之前读，边读书边喝苏格兰威士忌及苏打水。该吃饭的时候，她已醉眼蒙眬了，饭桌旁再来一瓶红酒，通常便醉得糊里糊涂，趁此入睡。

那是有情人之前的状况。有了情人之后，她的酒便喝得不那么多了，因为她不必非得喝醉酒才能入睡了。不过，那些情人叫她感到乏味无聊。她嫁的那个丈夫从未让她感到乏味过，而那些情人叫她觉得乏味得要死。

后来，她的一个孩子在一次飞机失事中丧了命。这次事件过后，她就再也不想要情人了，不再把酒当麻醉剂了，觉得必须开始新的人生。突然之间，她对孤独产生了强烈的恐惧感。不过，她想要的是一个能让自己敬重的伴侣。

事情发生了，经过极其简单。她喜欢他写的东西，一直都很羡慕他的生活方式。她觉得他是在按照自己的心愿生活。至于她是采用什么手段将他弄到了手，又是怎样最终迷恋上了他，反正都是些常规步骤。在这一过程之中，她给自己建立了一种新的生活，而他把自己残留下来的一部分旧的生活方式拿来做了交易的筹码。

他拿这个筹码换取的是高枕无忧的日子以及安逸的生活，这是毋庸置疑的。除此之外，还换取到了什么呢？他简直说不清楚。反正他想要什么，她就给他买什么。这一点，他心里是有数的。说起来，她是个挺不错的女人。对待她，就像对待别的女人一样，他非常乐意立刻和她上床，而且更愿意跟她逞床笫之欢，因为她更有钱，因为她让人心情愉悦，懂得欣赏人，还因为她从不惹是生非。现在，她苦心经营的小日子就要寿终正寝了。事情的起因是，两个星期前，一根刺扎破了他的膝盖，而他没有涂碘酒消毒。当时，他们看见一群非洲大羚羊，于是悄悄摸上去要拍照。那些羚羊昂起脑袋，支棱起耳朵听动静，一有响动就会逃进灌木林里去。就这样，羚羊跑了，照片没拍成，他的膝盖却被扎伤了。

此时，她走了过来。

他在小床上转过脸来，冲她打了声招呼。

“我打到了一只野羊，”她说道，“能给你炖上一锅美味汤。我叫他们捣些土豆泥，撒点奶粉进去。你现在感觉怎么样啦？”

“好多了。”

“简直太棒了！要知道，我有个预感，知道你可能会病情好转的。我走时，你正睡觉。”

“我睡得很死。你刚才走得很远吗？”

“不远，就在山后转了转。我一枪就把这只羊撂倒了。”

“你是个神枪手，枪法很棒。”

“我喜欢打枪，喜欢非洲。这是真的。如果你平平安安的，对我而言这可是最有意思的一次旅行了。和你一起打猎，你都不知道是多么有趣。我爱这个国家。”

“我也爱。”

“亲爱的，看见你病情好转，你都不知道多么叫人欣慰。见你受洋罪，我心里简直受不了。以后你不要再那样跟我讲话了，好不好？能答应我吗？”

“能。”他说，“我记不得自己都说了些什么了。”

“你可不能把我毁掉，好吗？我只不过是个深爱着你的中年女子，愿意听命于你，服从你的意愿。我已经被毁掉两三次了。你无意再让我经受一次毁灭，对不对？”

“我倒想在床上把你毁掉几次。”他说道。

“好呀，那可是令人舒畅的毁灭。要毁灭，就应该有那样的毁灭。明天飞机就要来了。”

“你怎么知道？”

“我敢肯定一定会来的。杂役把木头准备好了，还准备了青草熏浓烟。今天我又去检查了一遍，降机坪地方很宽，两边准备各生一堆浓烟。”

“是什么原因叫你断定飞机明天一定会来？”

“我有把握它一定会来。到了城里，他们就会把你的腿治好，那时咱们痛痛快快来一次‘毁灭’。这指的不是那些难听的话说的那种毁灭。”

“来杯酒怎么样？太阳都落山了。”

“你觉得自己能喝吗？”

“我是要喝上一杯的。”

“那咱们就一起喝吧。莫洛，拿威士忌加苏打水来！”她喊了一声。

“你最好穿上防蚊靴。”他建议道。

“洗完澡再穿吧……”

两人喝着酒，天色渐渐黑了下来。就在天色尚未黑透，但已没有了亮光，开枪无法瞄准目标时，一条鬣狗穿过空地向山后跑去。

“那个杂种每天晚上都从这里跑过，”男子说，“两个星期了，天天如此。”

“夜里叫的就是它。我倒无所谓。说来，这种动物挺招人嫌的。”

两人一道喝着酒，他感觉不到疼痛，只是由于老是一种姿势待在床上觉得有些不舒服。杂役们生起一堆篝火，投在帐篷上的光影跳跃着，他感到往日的那种对令人愉快的放纵生活所采取的听之任之的态度又回到了自己身上。她对他真是太好了。今天下午都怪他心肠太狠，有失公道。她是个好女人，实在是好极了。就在这时，他突然想到自己快要死了。

这一念头的出现突如其来，不是像一股水冲过来，或者像一阵风刮过来，而是像一种虚无缥缈的臭气突然飘了过来。奇怪的是，那条鬣狗循着这气味悄悄摸了过来。

“怎么啦，哈里？”她问道。

“没什么。”他说，“你最好坐到那边去，坐到迎着风的那个地方。”

“莫洛给你换过药了没有？”

“换过了。刚刚敷上硼酸膏。”

“感觉如何？”

“有点不稳定。”

“我去洗个澡，”她说，“这就去。回头咱们一起吃饭，然后把小床移进帐篷。”

他在心里对自己说，结束无谓的争吵是明智之举。跟这个女人，他吵架吵得不太多，可是跟那些自己所爱的女人却争吵不息。结果，吵架就像腐蚀剂，腐蚀掉了他和那些女人的感情。那时他爱得太深，索要的回报太多，把双方的感情都耗干了。

他回想起自己独身一人在君士坦丁堡漂泊的情形。那是在巴黎跟情人吵架之后，愤而出走的。那段时间，他日日风流，夜夜嫖娼。之后，却仍然未能消除孤独感，反而使孤独感愈加强烈。他给第一个情人，即那个离他而去的情人写了封信，说他难以忘怀昔日的感情……说有一次在摄政宫外以为看见了她，于是心里翻江倒海、思绪万千；他曾经在林荫大道尾随一个女人，因为那个女人长得跟她有点像，心中有几分担忧，一怕到头来发现那女人不是她，二怕失去跟踪过程中产生的温馨感情；他每每跟别的女人睡觉，只能加深他对她的思念之情；他无法摆脱对她的爱恋，对她以前的所作所为绝不会耿耿于怀。这封信是在俱乐部里写的，当时他没有喝酒，头脑冷静。信寄往纽约，求她回信寄到他在巴黎的事务所，那样似乎较为保险。那天晚上，他只有对她的思念，除此之外，心里空落落的。他在街上游荡，走过马克西姆饭店，路上泡了一个女郎，带着她一起去吃消夜。吃完消夜，两人一道去跳舞。女郎的舞步太糟糕，于是他撇下她，跟一个风骚的亚美尼亚浪荡女跳了起来——浪荡女跳舞时把肚皮在他的身上蹭来蹭去，蹭得他身上发烫。他和一个英国的炮兵中尉争风吃醋，硬要把亚美尼亚浪荡女带走。中尉让他出去较量。于是，两人走到黑灯瞎火的鹅卵石街面上拳脚相向，打了起来。他冲着中尉的下巴颏狠狠打了两拳，可对方没有被击倒，于是他心想这下有好戏看了。中尉挥拳打在他身上，再一拳打在他的眼眶上。而他来了个左勾拳，中尉扑过来抓住他的衣服，把袖子都扯掉了。他朝着中尉的后耳根猛击两拳，就在对方将他推开之际，急忙挥动右拳把对方放翻。中尉一个狗吃屎倒了下去。听见宪兵的脚步声，他带着浪荡女跑掉了。他们钻进一辆出租车，沿着博斯普鲁斯海峡向瑞米力西萨驶去，在寒夜里兜了一圈，然后去一家旅馆睡觉。她跟自己的相貌一样，在床上也是过于成熟了。不过，她肤如锦缎，体似玫瑰花瓣、蜂糖浆，肚皮平平展展，大胸脯，行事时臀下不用垫枕头。次日，在第一缕曙光之中，她一副邋遢相。在她没睡醒之前，他就离开了，带着一只青肿的眼，拎着他那件被扯掉一只袖子的上衣回到了佩拉宫酒店。

就在那天晚上，他起身前往安纳托利亚。记得在那趟旅途中，他们整天穿行在罂粟田间（罂粟是用来提炼鸦片的），时间久了，会让你产生奇怪的感觉，觉得不管往哪儿走，方向都是错的。最后，他来到了一处战场——部队曾和从君士坦丁堡刚赶到的军官一道发动进攻，而那些军官狗屁不通，让炮弹落在了自家的队伍里，气得英国观察员像个小孩子一样哇哇哇地哭。

也是在那一天，他第一次看见了死人——那些死人身穿白色芭蕾舞裙，脚上的鞋缀着绒球，向上翘起。当时，土耳其人不断朝前涌来，一波一波的。只见穿裙子的士兵们落荒而逃，军官开枪阻止也不管用，后来军官也狼狈鼠窜。他和英国观察员亦跑了起来，跑得他心口痛，嘴里满是尘土味。他们躲到岩石后边，看见土耳其人仍然一个劲朝前涌。接下来出现了一些他想都不敢想的事情，再往后他所看到的情景更是可怕。回到巴黎，对那段往事他不愿提起，就是别人说起来他也受不了。路过咖啡馆时，见那位美国诗人坐在里面，面前放着一摞碟子，土豆一样的脸上挂着愚蠢的表情，正在跟一个罗马尼亚人谈达达主义(8)运动。那个罗马尼亚人自称特里斯唐·查拉(9)，总戴着一个单片眼镜，老是闹头疼。他回到公寓和妻子过起了小日子，他又恢复了对于妻子的爱情，不再争吵，不再发狂——回家让他喜悦盈怀。事务所把收到的他的信件给他送了来。事情就是这样，他写的那封信有了回信，一天上午被人用一个托盘送了来。他一看那笔迹就浑身发冷，急慌慌想把那封信藏到另一封的底下。可妻子却问道：“那是谁来的信呀，亲爱的？”于是，刚刚开始的好日子就此被断送了。

对于和那些女人一起度过的悠悠岁月以及一场场的争吵，他仍记忆犹新。那些女人总是挑最不恰当的场合跟他拌嘴。她们真是没眼色，为什么总是在他心情最好的时候对他发难呢？关于情场上的这些遭遇，他从来没写过，一是因为他不想伤害她们，二是因为他的素材很广，似乎没必要写这些风流案。不过，他还是心存一念，觉得最终还是要写的。要写的东西真是多之又多。他目睹了大千世界的千变万化，而不仅仅是这些事件。他见多识广，对世人进行观察，不仅纵览，而且入微，至今仍能记得起人们在不同的时刻不同的表现。他置身于变化的潮流之中，观察了变化的过程，有责任把它写出来。可是，现在他却再也写不成了。

“你感觉怎么样了？”她问道。她在帐篷里洗完了澡，此时走了出来。

“还好。”

“能吃饭了吧？”

他看见莫洛立在她的身后，提着折叠桌，另一个杂役端着一些碟子。

“我想写点东西。”他说。

“你应该先喝些肉汤长长精神。”

“我今天夜里就要死了，”他说，“不需要长精神。”

“不要夸张嘛，哈里。求求你了。”她说。

“你为什么不用鼻子闻一闻！我半条腿都烂了，烂到大腿根了。都这样了，还喝什么肉汤呀。莫洛，给我拿威士忌加苏打水来！”

“求你还是喝肉汤吧。”她温情款语地说。

“那好吧。”

肉汤太烫，他只好端着盛肉汤的杯子放凉，不烫嘴之后一饮而尽，中间没有出现恶心的感觉。

“你是个好女人，”他说，“不要再为我操心了。”

她痴痴望着他。她的这张脸出现于《潮流》和《城市与乡村》杂志，家喻户晓，人人喜欢，只是由于酗酒减了几分颜色，还因为贪恋床笫之欢又减了几分颜色，但《城市与乡村》却显现不出她那诱人的酥胸、销魂的大腿以及那双轻抚你的腰背让你陶醉的纤手。他也望了望她，看到她那招牌式的微笑时，觉得死神又来到了跟前。这次，死神不是猛地冲过来，而是像一阵轻风徐徐刮来——这样的风吹得烛光摇曳，吹得火焰腾旺。

“过一会儿叫他们把我的蚊帐拿出来挂在树上，然后生一堆篝火。今晚我不进帐篷里睡了。不值得搬来搬去的。今天夜里是晴天，不会下雨的。”

死神就是这么来到的。它在低语，可惜你却听不到。绝不会再跟任何人吵架了——这一点他可以保证。这是一次前所未有过的人生经历，他可不愿坏了兴致。不过，他也许会败兴的，因为他老是成事不足败事有余。但这一次他或许不会坏事。

“你会不会听写？”

“从没学过。”她说。

“好吧。”

已经没有时间了。不过，往事浓缩了，只要处理得当，可以用一小段文字加以展现。

湖边有座山，山上有座原木筑成的木屋，原木之间的缝隙抹了白灰泥。门边的柱子上挂着一只铃铛，是叫人进屋吃饭用的。木屋后有片田野，再往远处则是树林。一排伦巴第白杨从木屋一直延伸向码头。还有一排白杨树排列在岬角旁。树林边有条羊肠小道通向山上。他曾经沿着这条小道采摘黑莓。后来木屋遭大火焚毁，而火塘旁鹿脚形枪架上的那些枪支也随之化为灰烬。大火过后，枪管和枪托烧坏了，枪膛里的子弹熔化了，残余物胡乱放在一堆灰上——那些灰是制肥皂的大铁锅用来熬碱液的。你问祖父能不能把那些东西拿来玩。祖父说不能。那些枪是他的宝贝，从那以后他再也没买过其他的枪，再也没打过猎。如今，在老地方又建起了一座木屋，漆成了白色。从门廊可以看见白杨树以及远处的湖泊，但木屋里再也没见到过枪支。那些曾经架在原木小屋墙壁鹿脚形枪架上的枪支，如今只剩下了枪管，胡乱放在灰堆之上，再也没有人动过。

战争结束后，我们在黑森林(10)租赁了一条小溪，可以在里面钓鳟鱼。有两条路可以抵达那儿。一条路是从特里贝格出发，直下山谷，沿一条白白的山谷小路前行，两旁是郁郁葱葱的林木，然后取一条偏道翻山越岭，沿途可见鳞次栉比的小农场和一幢幢高大的“黑森林”式房屋。这条偏道穿过小溪，而我们就是在偏道和小溪交叉的地方钓鱼的。

另一条路是爬陡坡抵达森林跟前，穿过松树林，翻过山头，出林子之后走到一片草场边，接着越过草场抵达那座小桥跟前。在那儿，小溪旁长着一排排桦树，水面不宽，而是很窄，溪水清澈、湍急，冲击着桦树的树根，冲出了一个个小水潭。在特里贝格的那家旅馆，正值好季节，老板的生意很是兴旺。当时的气氛令人愉悦，我们成了好朋友。可第二年遇上通货膨胀，他前一年挣的钱不够买开旅馆所用的必需品，于是他上吊寻了短见。

这些情况倒是可以口授，可是你在护墙广场(11)的所见所闻就难以口授了。在大街上，卖花的小贩给花上染料，弄得路面上染料水横流；这儿是公共汽车的发车点；老头老太太喜欢来此处喝葡萄酒和劣质的渣酿白兰地酒；孩子们在寒风中清鼻涕直流；“业余爱好者”咖啡馆里散发着难闻的汗臭和贫穷的气味，顾客们喝得酩酊大醉，而妓女们在风笛舞厅卖弄风情（她们就住在舞厅的楼上）。那个看门的女人在她的小房间里款待共和国卫队的队员，队员那插着马鬃的头盔放在一把椅子上。门厅对面住着个女子，丈夫是个自行车赛手。这天早晨喝牛奶时，她打开《车讯报》，看见丈夫在环巴黎车赛中名列第三（这是他首次参加大赛），不由满面生辉，大笑出声，然后手里拿着那份黄颜色的体育报，大喊大叫冲下楼去。经营风笛舞厅的是个女人，丈夫是开出租的。一次，他（即哈里）早晨赶飞机，女人的丈夫敲门叫醒他，两人到酒吧间的吧台喝了杯白酒，然后才出发。他跟那块区域的邻居混得很熟——那些邻居都是些穷人。

广场附近住着两类人——酒鬼和运动员。酒鬼借酒浇愁，以忘掉贫困，运动员则是坚持锻炼以驱除贫穷。他们是巴黎公社社员的后代，不用费力就熟知巴黎的政治。他们知道是谁枪杀了他们的父兄及亲友……当年，凡尔赛的军队开进巴黎，继巴黎公社之后占领了这座城市，见手上有老茧的、戴工人帽的，或者有任何其他的标志说明是工人的，一律格杀勿论。他住在这个贫民区里，街对面有个马肉铺和一个酿酒合作社。也就是在这里，他开始了自己的写作生涯。在巴黎，再也没有一块比这儿更叫他喜爱的社区了。他喜欢那婆娑的树影，喜欢那墙壁粉白但墙根涂成棕色的老房子，喜欢圆形广场上那些长长的绿色公共汽车，喜欢那在路面上流淌的染花用的紫色染料水，喜欢那从山上急转直下一直延伸向河边的莱蒙主教街以及另一条街——狭窄、热闹的穆费塔得街。穆费塔得街通向万神殿。还有一条他常在上面骑自行车的街道他也喜欢——那是该地区唯一一条沥青路，在车轮下平平展展的，两旁有又窄又高的房屋和一座高高耸立的廉价旅馆（保罗·魏尔伦(12)就是在这家旅馆离开人世的）。他们住的公寓里只有两个房间。他租了廉价旅馆顶层的一个房间，月房租是六十法郎，专门在此处写作，从窗口可以看到各家各户的屋顶和烟囱，也可以将巴黎的山峦尽收眼底。

从公寓的窗口，却只能看到那家经营木材和煤炭的店铺。他还卖酒，卖劣质酒。马肉铺外边挂着金黄色的马头，而橱窗里挂的是金黄色和红色的马肉。他们一般都到涂着绿漆的酿酒合作社里买酒，那儿的酒物美价廉。其余的景物还有泥灰墙以及邻居家的窗户。夜间酒鬼醉卧街头，哼哼唧唧地呻吟，呈现出典型的法国式醉态（根据宣传，这种醉态压根就不存在），此时邻居们会打开窗户，嗡嗡嗡地交流看法。

“警察跑到哪里去了？不需要他的时候，他偏偏在跟前晃悠，现在却跟哪个女人睡觉去了。还是找个顶事的人来吧。”一桶冷水从哪家的窗口兜头泼了下来，酒鬼这才不乱哼唧了。“这是什么？是水！天呀，这是个好主意！”各家的窗户纷纷关上了。他的女佣玛丽针对八个小时的工作日提出了抗议，说道：“丈夫如果上班上到六点，回家的路上只能喝一点点酒，挥霍的钱不算太多，但如果五点就下班，那他就会夜夜酗酒，把兜里的钱挥霍一空。缩短工时，让工人之妻深受其害。”

“想再喝些肉汤吗？”女人问他

“不喝了。非常感谢，肉汤好喝极了。”

“再喝几口吧。”

“我倒想喝几口威士忌加苏打水。”

“喝酒对你不好。”

“是的，是不好。为此，科尔·波特(13)还专门写过一首歌，并谱了曲呢。恐怕正因为了解这些，你才生我的气。”

“你心里清楚我是愿意让你喝酒的。”

“哦，是吗？愿意让我喝，却又说酒对我不好！”

他心想，等她离开，他想喝多少就喝多少。哦，不，不是想喝多少就喝多少，而是有多少就喝多少。唉，他累了，简直太累了，必须睡一会儿才行。他静静地躺着，发现死神不在跟前，觉得死神一定是到别的地方遛大街去了，可能是结着伴儿，骑着自行车，或者一声不吭地走在人行道上。

不，他从未写过巴黎，未写过让他魂牵梦绕的巴黎。还有些内容他也从未写过。那么，它们究竟是什么呢？

那牧场，那银灰色的鼠尾草灌木丛，灌溉渠里那清澈、湍急的水流，那深绿色的苜蓿！羊肠小道在山间蜿蜒，夏季的牛儿像鹿一样腼腆。牛群哞哞地叫着，喧闹的声音不绝于耳，你秋季赶它们下山时，它们慢慢移动着步子，身后扬起一片尘土。翻过山梁，夕阳中那突兀的山峰清晰可见。月亮升起，在月光下骑马沿羊肠小道下山，山谷里一片皎洁的月色。记得穿过树林时，眼前漆黑，伸手不见五指，只好抓住马的尾巴前行。往事如烟，他曾经有意付诸笔端。

还有那个脑子缺根弦的干杂活的伙计……当时把他留下来看护牧场，叮咛他不准任何人动用牧场上的干草。那个老杂种从河岔口过来，想弄些饲料。小伙计曾为老杂种干过活，挨过他的打，此时一口拒绝了对方，老杂种威胁说还要揍他一顿。小伙计从厨房拿来一杆步枪，就在老杂种试图闯进饲料房时，开枪把他打死了。大家回到牧场时，老杂种已死去一个星期了，尸体在牲口栏里冻得硬邦邦，一部分尸体已被野狗吃掉。你把剩下的尸体卷在毯子里，用绳子捆在雪橇上，让小伙计帮你拖走。你们俩拖着雪橇上路，走了六十英里进城，然后你举报了他。小伙计怎么也想不到自己会被逮捕，满以为自己是在履行职责，以为你是他的朋友，以为自己会得到奖赏呢。老杂种的尸体是他帮着拖来的，谁都知道老杂种是个坏家伙，企图抢走并不属于他的饲料！警长给他戴手铐时，他简直不能相信这是真的，禁不住痛哭流涕……这一素材他原本是打算写成故事的。这样的素材何止二十个，可是他一个都没有用于写作。为什么？

“你说说这是为什么。”他出声地说道。

“什么为什么，亲爱的？”

“哦，没什么。”

自从有了他，她就不再那么嗜酒如命了。但尽管如此，他也绝对不会写她的，对此他是很清楚的。这类人一个都不写！富人乏味得很，喝酒喝得太多，整天就知道玩双陆棋(14)，一个个无聊得厉害，全无鲜明个性。他想起了可怜的朱利安以及朱利安对富人带有浪漫色彩的敬畏感，记得后者写过一篇小说，头一句话便是：“富佬们跟你我截然不同。”八成是有人风趣地对朱利安说富人的钱多得花不完，可是朱利安并不觉得风趣，而是将富人看作一个特殊的富于魅力的种群。当朱利安发现并非如此时，他的心都碎了，就像他的其他幻觉破灭时心碎一样。

至于他，对于那些因幻觉破灭而心碎的人，压根就瞧不起。他心明如镜，当然瞧不起那些人了。他觉得自己打不垮压不倒，因为他什么都不在乎，任什么都伤害不了他。

没什么了不起的。现在就连死亡他也不在乎。一直以来，他唯一害怕的东西是疼痛。他固然能和别人一样忍得住痛，直到疼痛持续的时间太长，折磨得他筋疲力尽。可这一次，正当他疼得死去活来，眼看就要崩溃时，疼痛感却突然停止了。

记得很久以前，一天夜里，投弹军官威廉逊钻铁丝网时，被德军巡逻队扔来的一颗手榴弹炸伤了。他疼得乱叫，央求战友开枪打死他。他是个胖子，虽然喜欢出风头，但作战极其勇敢，称得上一名优秀军官。那天夜里，他被缠在铁丝网上，探照灯光把他照得一览无余，只见他的肠子都被炸了出来，挂在铁丝上。战友们把他救回来时，只好将肠子割断。“开枪打死我，哈里！看在基督的分上，开枪打死我！”他惨叫着。记得关于疼痛，大家有过一场讨论，有人说天主绝不会让你经历无法忍受的疼痛，还有人说疼痛会在某个时刻自行消失的。但他一直对威廉逊的遭遇难以忘怀，记得那天夜里威廉逊的疼痛始终没有消失。他把自己留下来准备自服的吗啡片给了威廉逊，也没有止住对方的疼痛。

眼下，他倒是感到挺轻松的。只要疼痛感不加剧，就没有什么可担心的。他所渴望得到的是一个较好的伴侣。

关于自己想要什么样的伴侣，他略微想了想。

他觉得自己做事优柔寡断，总是迟一步。你总不能让人家老等着你吧。一旦分离，便各奔东西。昔日的聚会已经结束，现在只剩下了你和女主人在一起。他觉得要死还一时死不了，就像所有别的冗长的事情一样让他都感到厌烦了。

“烦死了。”他想着想着说出了声。

“你说什么来着，亲爱的？”

“我是说任何事情都拖得太久。”

说话时，他隔着篝火望着她的脸。她靠在椅背上，火光照亮了她的那张线条优美的脸，看得出她已经有了困意。此刻，他听见篝火的光圈外边传来了鬣狗的一声嚎叫。

“我在写东西，”他说，“感觉很是疲倦。”

“你看你能睡得着吗？”

“这没问题。你为什么不去睡觉呢？”

“我喜欢陪你坐着。”

“难道你感觉有哪个地方不对劲吗？”

“不是的。只是感到有点困。”

“我觉得有点不对劲。”他说。

他感觉到死神又在跟前徘徊了。

“要知道，我唯一没有失去的就是好奇心了。”他对她说道。

“你任何东西都没有失去。你是我所认识的最完美的男子汉。”

“天呀，”他说，“女人家知道的事情真是太少了。你凭什么这么说？难道凭的是直觉？”

此时此刻，他看见死神走上前，将头枕在床脚上，他甚至闻得到死神呼出的气味。

“要是有人说死神像镰刀和骷髅，你可千万别信，”他对她说，“死神完全可以是两个骑自行车的警察，或者说是一只鸟。也许，死神像鬣狗一样有一个宽宽的鼻子。”

此时，死神向他走了过来，但没有任何形体，只是占了一些空间罢了。

“让它走开！”

它没有走开，而是继续朝跟前凑。

“你呼出的气好臭呀，”他冲它说道，“你这臭烘烘的东西。”

它又靠近了些，而他已说不出话来了。它见他说不出话，就又朝前凑了凑。他口不能言，试图将其赶走，可是它爬到了他身上，重重压在他的胸口上，稳稳当当坐在那里，使得他动不能动、说不能说，却听得见那女人说道：“先生睡着了。你们把床抬起来，手脚放轻，抬进帐篷里去。”

他说不出话，无法让女人将死神赶走。死神坐在那里，越来越重，压得他透不过气。当杂役把床抬起来时，感觉却突然好了，压在胸口上的重量消失了。




此时到了早晨，天已经亮了一些时间了。他听见了飞机的声音。飞机显得很小，在空中兜了一个大圈。杂役们跑出去用煤油点火，将青草堆在火上，于是空地两端就有了两大堆火，冒着滚滚浓烟。晨风习习，把烟吹到了帐篷这儿来。飞机又兜了两圈，此时飞得很低，然后向下滑翔和拉平，最终平稳地落在了地上。接着就见康普顿老伙计走了过来，下穿宽松长裤，上穿粗花呢夹克，头戴一顶棕色毡帽。

“怎么啦，老伙计？”康普顿问了一声。

“腿受伤了。”他说道，“需要吃些早点吗？”

“不用了，谢谢。喝杯茶就行了。我的这架飞机是‘舟蛾’型的，只能坐一个乘客，这次就带不了太太了。你们的卡车已在路上了。”

海伦把康普顿拉到了一边，和他说了些什么。康普顿回来时，显得异常高兴。

“这就抬你上飞机，”他说，“送完你，我再回来接太太。恐怕中途得在阿鲁沙停一下加油。现在最好马上出发。”

“茶还喝不喝了？”

“随便说说，我并不是真的想喝茶。”

杂役抬起小床，绕过一个个绿色的帐篷，下了石台，走到空地上。空地两端的火堆烧得正旺，冒烟的青草已熊熊燃烧，风助火势，火势越大。杂役从火堆旁经过，把床抬到了小飞机跟前。抬他进机舱时，着实费了一番力气。而一进机舱，他便瘫倒在皮椅上，伤腿直直伸到飞行员的座位旁。康普顿把飞机发动后，钻进了驾驶舱。他向海伦及杂役们挥手告别。飞机发出咔嗒咔嗒的声音，随后那咔嗒声变成了他所熟悉的吼叫。康普顿让飞机掉过头，躲开疣猪打的洞，轰隆轰隆颠簸着开过两堆火之间的空地，最后又颠了一下便腾空而起。他看见底下的人们在挥手，山丘旁的营地成了平面图，平原一望无际，一片片的树丛和灌木丛成了扁平状，通向干涸水坑的狩猎小道显得很平展。他还看见了一处自己以前所不知道的水源地。斑马显得很小，只能看得见它们那圆滚滚的脊背。牛羚成了蠕动的黑点，昂着巨大的脑袋，像长长的手指一样穿过平原。当飞机投下的影子向它们冲来时，吓得它们四散逃窜。它们小极了，虽疾奔却像是爬行。极目远眺，看得见平原一片灰黄色，而眼前看到的则是康普顿的粗花呢夹克和棕色毡帽。飞机下开始有大山出现了，牛羚群正在往山上爬。从群山上空飞过时，看得见山谷陡峭，那儿的森林郁郁葱葱，坡地上竹林成片。再往前飞，仍是浓密的森林，覆盖了山巅，覆盖了峡谷。飞过森林，山势逐渐平缓，山后又出现了平原。天气炎热，平原上一片紫棕色。飞机在热浪中颠簸着。康普顿回头看了看，看他情况如何。飞着飞着，前边又出现了群山，黑压压的。

后来，他们转了方向，没有继续朝着阿鲁沙飞，而是拐向了左边。他猜想一定是飞机加好了油。往下看，只见一片粉红色的云彩掠过大地，那云彩像筛子眼里筛出来的一样，从空中看，又像是凭空而降的暴风雪袭来时打头阵的飞雪。他知道那是从南方飞来的蝗虫。接下来，飞机开始往高爬，像是朝东方飞，飞着飞着天色黑了下来，原来是遇到了暴风雨，雨点密密麻麻，弄得飞机像是在穿过一道瀑布。暴风雨过后，康普顿回过头咧嘴笑了笑，然后指了指前方，只见那儿矗立着乞力马扎罗山的山巅，方方正正，开阔得不得了，高耸入云，在阳光下白得令人无法相信。他意识到那儿是他的目的地。




就在这时，在一片夜色里，鬣狗不再呜咽，开始发出一种奇怪的声音，跟人的哭声差不多。女人听了，不安地翻了个身，但没有醒来。梦中的她待在长岛的家里，那是女儿步入社交界的头一个夜晚。不知怎么，她的父亲也在场，显得很粗暴。鬣狗的叫声太大，把她从梦中吵醒了。一时间，她不知自己身在何处，不由感到非常害怕。她拿起手电筒，照了照另外的一张床——那张床是哈里睡着后大家抬进帐篷里来的。透过蚊帐，她可以看到哈里的身躯，但不知怎么哈里的一条腿伸了出来，耷拉在小床的一边，绷带都脱落了，让她不忍看下去。

“莫洛！”她喊了起来，“莫洛！莫洛！”

随后，她叫道：“哈里！哈里！”见对方没答应，她提高了嗓门，“哈里！请你醒醒！天呀，哈里！”

她听不到回答，也听不到哈里的呼吸声。

帐篷外，鬣狗又在叫了——正是那奇怪的叫声惊醒了她。但此刻，她却听不见那叫声了，因为她的心怦怦乱跳，心跳声盖过了那叫声。

桥头旁边的老人


一个戴金丝边眼镜的老人坐在路边，衣服上落满了灰尘。河上架着个浮桥，桥上人来车往，有骡车有汽车，有男人有女人，也有小孩。下了桥就是陡坡，骡车爬坡时十分吃力，几个士兵用手抓住车轮的轮辐帮着朝上推。一辆辆卡车轰隆轰隆开上坡，随后向远方驶去。一些农民在脚踝深的尘土里艰难跋涉。而老人坐在那里，连挪动一下也没有。他太累了，一步也走不动了。

当时我的任务是过桥去侦察桥头堡，看敌军推进到了哪个地方。完成任务后，我又经桥上返回。此时车辆已不多了，行人也稀稀拉拉的。可老人仍坐在原来的地方。

“你是哪儿来的？”我问他。

“从圣·卡洛斯来。”他说完笑了笑。

圣·卡洛斯是他的故乡，提到那儿让他高兴，于是脸上出现了笑容。

“我当时正在照看几只动物。”他解释说。

“是吗？”我说道。对于他的话，我不太明白。

“是的。”他说，“我留在圣·卡洛斯镇照看动物，是最后一个离开的。”

看他那样子，既不像羊倌也不像牛倌。我望了望他那落满了灰尘的黑衣服以及满是尘土的脏脏的脸，又望望他的金丝边眼镜，然后问道：“什么动物呀？”

“有各种各样的动物。”他说着，无奈地摇了摇头，“没办法，只好把它们丢下了。”

搭着话，我眼睛观察着桥面，观察着那非洲味十足的埃布罗河(1)三角洲地区，心里在打小鼓，不知敌军还有多长时间就会出现。我侧耳倾听动静——一有动静便预示着那带有几分神秘色彩的遭遇战就会打响。这段时间，老人始终坐在那儿。

“都有什么动物？”我问。

“总共有三种，”他回答说，“两只山羊、一只猫以及四对鸽子。”

“你是被迫把它们丢在了身后？”我问。

“是的。因为那儿在打炮。上尉怕我伤着，劝我赶快走。”

“你家里没亲人吗？”我问着话，一边观察着远处的桥头，那儿最后的几辆骡车正在驶下河岸的斜坡。

“没有。”他说，“只有我刚才提到的几只动物。那只猫当然不成问题，它会照料自己的。我所担心的是另外几只动物，真不知它们会怎么样。”

“你有政治信仰吗？”我问。

“我不过问政治。”他说，“我已是七十六岁的人了，今天走了有十二公里的路，恐怕再也走不动了。”

“这地方不适合于歇脚。”我说，“如果你还能走得动，岔路口那边有卡车，那儿通向托尔托萨。”

“我要等一会儿，”他说，“等一会儿再走。卡车是到哪儿去的？”

“到巴塞罗那。”我说。

“那边我没有认识的人。”他说，“不过，还是要感谢你的。非常感谢。”

他望着我，目光茫然、疲倦。随后，他好像是为了有个人为他分担一些心里的忧虑，又说道：“那只猫能熬得过去，这一点是肯定的，没必要为它操心。但另外的几只动物就不行了。你看它们会不会出事呢？”

“哦，它们可能会挺得过来的。”

“你是这么想的吗？”

“那是没有问题的。”我说着话，眼睛盯着远处的河岸，那边已看不到骡车了。

“他们叫我走，是因为要打炮了。可是，一旦开炮，那些动物该怎么办呢？”

“鸽子笼的门没有关吧？”我问。

“没有。”

“那它们会飞走的。”

“是呀，它们肯定会飞走的。可别的那几个是不会飞的。算啦，不为它们担心了。”他说。

“歇够了吧？我该走了。”我催促道，“你站起来，看能不能走。”

“谢谢你了。”他说完站了起来，可是摇晃了几下，又一屁股坐到了尘土里。

“我原来是在照料动物的。”他木然地说道，这次的话不是讲给我听的，而是喃喃自语，“我只是照料照料动物，又没有妨碍谁。”

对于他，我爱莫能助。那天是复活节的星期天，法西斯正在逼近埃布罗河。当时，天色昏暗，阴云压顶，法西斯的飞机没能起飞。这一点，再加上猫能够自己照料自己，对老人而言就是不幸中的万幸了。

在密歇根州北部


吉姆·吉尔摩从加拿大来到霍顿斯湾，从霍顿老头手中把铁匠铺买了下来。吉姆矮矮的个子，皮肤黝黑，大胡子，大手。他是个钉马掌的行家，可即便系上皮裙，他也不太像个铁匠。他歇宿于铁匠铺的楼上，就餐于迪·吉·史密斯家中。

莉兹·科茨为史密斯家干杂活。史密斯夫人是个大块头女人，酷爱干净。说莉兹·科茨是她所见过的最整洁的姑娘。莉兹有两条漂亮的腿，腰间总系着干干净净的条纹棉布围裙。吉姆注意到她头后的发辫总是一丝不乱。他喜欢她的脸，因为那张脸上荡漾着欢乐，可是对她这个人心里却没有多想。

莉兹对吉姆喜欢得不得了。她喜欢他从铁匠铺走过来的样子，于是常跑到厨房门口，等着看他沿大路走过来。她喜欢看他的大胡子，喜欢他微笑时露出的一口白牙。就连他看上去不像个铁匠以及史密斯夫妇对他有好感，也让她喜欢。一天，吉姆在屋外的洗脸盆里擦身子，她看到他胳膊上的毛是黑的，而没有被太阳晒黑的上半部分十分白，她发现这竟然也让她感到喜欢。这种莫名的喜欢叫她觉得挺可笑的。

霍顿斯湾是个小镇，镇上的一条大路，一头通达博伊恩市，另一头通向沙勒沃伊，这条大路上只有五户人家。镇上有座房屋，既是杂货铺又是邮局，有个高高的假门脸，或许门前还会停放一辆大车。那五户人家是史密斯家、斯特劳德家、迪尔沃思家、霍顿家以及范·胡森家。这些住家坐落于一大片榆树林中。那条大路是条沙土路，路两边是农田和树林。顺着大路朝前走是卫理公会教堂，而相反的方向则是所镇办学校。铁匠铺用油漆漆成了红色，和学校面对面。

一条陡峭的沙土路顺山而下，穿过树林，直达港湾。从史密斯家的后门眺望，目光越过延伸向山脚下湖边的林木，可以看到港湾对面的景色。春夏两季，这儿风光旖旎，港湾湛蓝湛蓝，阳光明媚，从沙勒沃伊和密歇根湖那边吹来的微风会在岬角后的湖面上掀起朵朵白浪。从史密斯家的后门口观景，莉兹看得到运矿石的驳船行驶在湖面上，朝着博伊恩市开去。眼睛望着那些驳船，它们好像一动不动。可是，如果进厨房擦干净几个碟子再走出来看，驳船就不见了踪影，消失在了岬角之后。

莉兹心里无时无刻不在想着吉姆·吉尔摩，可是对方似乎对她并不十分上心。他老是跟迪·吉·史密斯谈铁匠铺的事，谈共和党，谈詹姆斯·吉·布莱恩(1)。晚上，他则凑在前厅的灯下读《托莱多(2)刀锋报》和《大急流城报》，要不然就提着灯和迪·吉·史密斯一道去港湾里叉鱼。秋天，他则随史密斯、查利·怀曼，赶着大车，带上帐篷、干粮、斧子、步枪以及两条狗，前往范德比尔特那边的松树平原猎鹿。在他们出发之前，莉兹和史密斯夫人为他们准备吃的，要忙活四天。莉兹原本想特地为吉姆做些东西带去路上吃，却最终没有如愿，因为她不敢问史密斯夫人要鸡蛋和面粉，假如自己去买了食材来，做的时候又怕被史密斯夫人看见。其实，史密斯夫人是不会计较的，可莉兹就是不敢。

吉姆去猎鹿期间，莉兹老想他。他这一走，时间可真是难熬呀。由于思念他，她睡觉也睡得不香了。不过，她发现正是因为想他，生活也有了乐趣。听之任之，日子倒是挺好的。他们回来的头一天晚上，她彻夜未眠，意思是说她认为自己彻夜未眠——她魂游梦乡，分不清自己究竟睡着了没有。看见大车沿着大路驶来，她心里翻江倒海，忐忑不安，有一种急不可耐的心情。直到看见吉姆，她的心才安宁了下来。看来，吉姆一回来，万般忧虑都烟消云散了。大车停在了外边的那棵大榆树下，史密斯夫人和莉兹迎了出去。男人们满脸胡须，大车的后面装着三只鹿，细细的鹿腿从车厢边硬邦邦地戳了出来。史密斯夫人吻了吻迪·吉，后者则给了她一个拥抱。吉姆说了声“你好，莉兹”，然后咧嘴一笑。事先，莉兹并不知道吉姆回来后会出现什么情况，但她觉得一定会发生什么事件。可是，什么事件也没有发生。男人们回家了，仅此而已。吉姆把蒙在鹿身上的粗麻袋片取掉，莉兹朝车上瞅了一眼。有一只鹿是大个头公鹿，已经僵硬了，从车上卸下来时费了些气力。

“这只是你打的吗，吉姆？”莉兹问。

“是的。漂亮不漂亮？”吉姆说着，把公鹿扛到背上，扛到熏制室里去了。

晚上，查利·怀曼留在史密斯家吃饭，由于天色已晚，回不成沙勒沃伊了。男人们擦洗完，来到前厅等着吃饭。

“酒罐里还剩下一些酒吧，吉米(3)？”迪·吉·史密斯问。吉姆听了，便到停放在谷仓里的大车那儿，去取狩猎路上带的那个威士忌酒罐。酒罐能装四加仑，罐底还有不少酒液在晃荡。回屋的路上，吉姆美美地喝了一大口。酒罐太大，把它举起来喝酒决非易事。一不小心，一些威士忌酒液流到了他的衬衫前襟上。那两个男人见他抱着酒罐进来，不由得会心一笑。迪·吉·史密斯让取酒杯来，莉兹应命去取了来。迪·吉斟满了三大杯。

“来，为你干杯，迪·吉！”查利·怀曼说。

“为那只大公鹿干杯，吉米！”迪·吉说。

“为所有没有被打中的猎物干杯！”吉姆说完，把杯里的酒一饮而尽。

“男子汉就应该喝这样的酒。”

“真是一杯解千愁呀。”

“再来一杯怎么样，伙计们？”

“祝你万事如意，迪·吉！”

“祝大家万事如意，伙计们！”

“为明年干杯！”

吉姆开始有了腾云驾雾的感觉。他喜欢威士忌的味道，喜欢畅饮威士忌的那种感觉。回家真好——这儿有舒服的床、热腾腾的食物，有那个铁匠铺。他干完了一杯之后，又来了一杯。男人进餐厅吃饭时，一个个兴高采烈，但不失风度。莉兹把饭菜端上来，也坐在桌旁跟大家一起进餐。饭菜的味道喷香，男人们吃圆了肚子。饭后，他们又回到了前厅，而莉兹和史密斯夫人清理桌面。忙活完，史密斯夫人上楼休息去了。不一会儿，史密斯走出前厅，也上楼去了。吉姆和查利仍在前厅闲坐。莉兹坐在厨房里炉子旁边，假装在看书，心里却净在想吉姆。她不甘心就这么去睡觉，觉得吉姆早晚都会从前厅出来的，想着趁他出来最后看他一眼，之后带着他的眼神上床睡觉。

就在她苦苦把吉姆千思万想时，吉姆从前厅出来了。他双眼闪着亮光，头发有点凌乱。莉兹没抬眼睛，把目光盯在书上。吉姆步上前，站在了她的椅后。她可以感觉到他的呼吸。后来，他把她抱在了怀里。在他的抚摸下，她感到胸脯发胀，乳头挺立了起来。她吓得魂魄都没有了，因为还没有男人摸过她呢。同时，她也有一丝庆幸，心想：“他终于来找我了。这是千真万确的。”

由于害怕，她身体变得发硬，真不知如何是好。吉姆搂紧她，使她紧贴椅背，吻了她一口。随之而至的是一种剧烈的疼痛感，一种受伤害的感觉，她觉得自己都快受不了了。透过椅背，她感觉得到吉姆，一时间都快崩溃了。而就在这时，她的内心咔嗒响了一下，随之便有了温暖的感觉，便有了缱绻的柔情。吉姆搂紧她，让她紧贴椅背，而此刻的她渴望得到吉姆的拥抱。吉姆悄声说：“走，咱们出去走走。”

莉兹从厨房的衣钩上取下外套，两人厮跟着出了门。吉姆用一只胳膊搂住她的腰。他们走几步路就要停下来，搂一搂抱一抱。吉姆不断地吻她。天上没有月亮，他们走在路上，沙土有脚踝深，穿过树林，一直走到港湾旁的码头和库房那儿。湾里的水轻轻拍打着码头的木桩，港湾对面的岬角黑黢黢地矗立在那儿。天气寒冷，但是和吉姆在一起，莉兹感到浑身热乎乎的。两人走到仓库的遮檐下坐了下来。吉姆把她拉到怀里。她害怕了。吉姆把一只手伸进她的怀里摸她的胸脯，另一只手搭在她的膝上。她惊魂难定，不知接下来会出现什么情况，可是身子却偎紧了他。她觉得搭在她膝上的那只手大极了。后来，那只手移到了她的腿上，接着便顺着腿朝上摸。

“别这样，吉姆！”她说道。吉姆没理会，那只手继续朝上摸。

“你不能这样，吉姆。你不能这样。”

可是，无论是吉姆还是吉姆的那只大手，对她的央求都没有加以理会。地板很硬。吉姆已经掀起了她的衣服，对她有所图谋。她心里又害怕又渴望。她必须实现心愿，同时又感到心惊肉跳。

“你不能这样，吉姆。你不能这样。”

“我必须这样。我要做的。你也知道不做是不行的。”

“不，不能这样，吉姆。不该这样。这样做是不对的。哎哟，那东西太大，把我弄疼了。不能这样。哎哟，吉姆。吉姆，哎哟。”

码头的铁杉木板已经破损，又冰又硬。吉姆重重压在她身上，对她的伤害已经造成。她觉得难受，浑身痉挛，推了一把吉姆。吉姆竟然呼呼大睡起来，一动不动。她挣扎了几下，总算从吉姆的身下挣脱了，然后拉了拉裙子和衣服，用手指梳理了一下头发。吉姆仍在大睡，嘴巴微张。她俯下身子，吻了吻他的脸颊。他没醒，仍在梦乡中。她把他的头朝上抬了抬，摇了摇。他脑袋一歪，转了过去，咽了一口口水。她不由潸然泪下，举步走到码头边，望了望脚下的水。轻雾从港湾那儿冉冉升起。她身上发冷，心里一阵悲哀，觉得一切都完了。她回到吉姆躺着的地方，又摇了摇他，想把他摇醒。

她流着泪说道：“吉姆，吉姆，求求你了，快醒醒。”

吉姆仅仅动了动，身子蜷缩成了一团。她脱下外套，俯身给他盖上，然后为他掖好，动作麻利、细心。接着，她穿过码头，走上陡峭的沙土路回家睡觉去了。轻雾带着寒意从港湾升起，弥漫在树林里。

印第安人营地


又有一条小船被拽上了湖岸。两个印第安人站立在一旁。

尼克和父亲坐进了小船的尾部。印第安人用力一推，把小船推下水，其中的一个跳进去准备划桨。乔治大叔乘的是营地的小船，坐在小船的尾部。那个年纪轻的印第安人推营地的船下水，为他执桨。

在一片黑暗中，两条船出发了。浓雾茫茫，尼克听见前边老远的地方另外一条船的桨架发出咯吱咯吱的声响。印第安人划动着船桨，又快又猛。尼克躺了下来，父亲用一条胳膊搂着他。水面上寒气逼人。为他们父子划船的那个印第安人倒是挺卖力的，可是另一条船在浓雾里始终领先于他们，越来越远了。

“这是去哪儿，爸爸？”尼克问。

“去印第安人营地。有个印第安妇女病得很厉害。”

“明白了。”尼克说。

到了港湾的对面，他们发现另一条船已被拉上了岸。乔治大叔在黑影里抽雪茄。那个年轻的印第安人把小船在沙滩上拖了好一段路。乔治大叔给了两个印第安人每人一根雪茄烟。

大家离开沙滩，穿过一片露水浸湿的草地。年轻的印第安人提着一盏灯在前边引路。后来进了树林，沿着一条羊肠小道前行，而小道通向运木材的大路，大路则通向山间。大路上要亮堂得多，因为两边的树都被砍光了。年轻的印第安人停住脚步，吹灭了灯。大家继续前行。

他们转过一道弯，见一条狗狂吠着跑了过来。前边几间简陋的小屋里亮着灯，那儿住着一些靠剥树皮为生的印第安人(1)。又有几条狗冲了过来。两个印第安人喝退了它们。离道路最近的小屋窗口闪射出一线灯光。一个老妪提着一盏灯等候在门口。

屋里的木床上躺着一个年轻的印第安女子。她在生孩子，已经两天了也没把孩子生下来。营地里的老年妇女纷纷前来照料她，男人们则顺着大路走得远远的，直到听不见她的惨叫声，坐在黑影里抽烟。尼克以及那两个印第安人随父亲和乔治大叔走进小屋时，正赶上产妇在惨叫。她躺在双层床的下铺，盖着被子，肚子鼓得很大，脑袋偏向一旁。上铺躺着她的丈夫。几天前他干活时，斧头掉在脚上，把脚伤得很厉害。此刻，他在抽烟，把屋里弄得烟味很重。

尼克的父亲吩咐把水放到炉子上烧热。在此期间，他跟尼克说了几句话。

“这个妇人要生孩子了，尼克。”他说道。

“我知道。”尼克说。

“你并不了解。”父亲说，“我讲给你听。产妇正在经历的阶段叫‘分娩’。孩子想从肚子里出来，她也想把孩子生下来，于是肌肉紧绷，用全身力气生孩子。她尖声叫喊，就是因为这种情况的出现。”

“明白了。”尼克说。

他话音未落，产妇又尖叫了一声。

“天呀，爸爸，你就不能给她服点药，让她不要再叫了？”尼克问。

“不行，我没有带麻药。”父亲说，“她叫不叫都没有关系。因为没有关系，我都不去听她的。”

躺在上铺的那个丈夫翻了个身，把脸转向墙壁。

在厨房里忙活的那个女人冲医生（尼克的父亲）做了个手势，表示水已经热了。后者走进厨房，把大壶里的水倒进脸盆，倒了大概有一半的样子。接着，他将包在一块手帕里的几样药物放入大壶剩下的水里。

“这个是需要烧开的。”他叮咛道。然后，他就用盆里的热水以及营地里带来的一块肥皂开始洗手，边洗边搓。尼克在一旁观看，看父亲用肥皂把两只手搓来搓去的。父亲洗手洗得很仔细，很彻底，嘴里还说着话。

“要知道，尼克，生小孩应该是头先出来，但例外的情况时有发生。遇到这例外的情况，可就麻烦了。这个产妇出现这种情况，恐怕得做手术。等一会儿就知道了。”

待他觉得把手洗干净了，便到产妇那儿准备接生。

“请你把被子掀开好吗，乔治？”他说，“我的手是不能动那被子的。”

随后，接生开始了。乔治大叔和三个印第安男子用力将产妇按住。产妇在乔治大叔的胳膊上咬了一口，气得乔治大叔骂了一声：“该死的臭婆娘！”惹得划船送他过来的那个年轻印第安人大笑了几声。这期间，尼克为父亲端着脸盆。接生接了很长时间。孩子生下来后，父亲将他拎起，拍了拍，让他能够呼吸，最后把他交给了那个老妪。

“你也看到了，尼克，是个男孩。”他说，“让你当这个实习医生，还喜欢吧？”

“还好吧。”尼克说，眼睛却望着别处，因为他不愿看父亲手里正在做的事情。

“好啦，这就可以了。”父亲说着，不知把什么东西放进了脸盆里。尼克连看也没有看。

“接下来，”父亲说道，“需要缝上几针。你看不看都可以，尼克，随你怎么样吧。我要把割开的口子缝上。”

尼克没有观看那一幕。他的好奇心早已不见了踪影。

父亲将伤口缝合后，直起了身子。乔治大叔和那三个印第安男子也直起了身子。尼克把脸盆端到了厨房里。

乔治大叔低头看了看自己的胳膊。那个年轻的印第安人想起刚才的情景，微微一笑。

“我会给你涂点双氧水的，乔治。”医生说。他说完，俯下身子查看印第安产妇的情况。产妇现在安静了下来，双目紧闭，面如死灰。她不知道孩子的状况，对于别的情况也一无所知。

“明天早晨我再过来看看。”医生直起了身子说，“中午，会有护士从圣·伊格纳斯赶来，把需要的东西都带过来。”

他心情很好，话也多了起来，就像足球运动员赛后回到更衣室里一样，说起话来滔滔不绝的。

“这台手术简直可以上医学杂志了，乔治。”他说，“用一把大折刀做剖腹产手术，缝伤口用的是锥形羊肠线！”

乔治大叔靠着墙根，眼睛望着自己那被咬伤了的胳膊。

“是呀，你的确十分了不起。”他说。

“应该看看那个自豪的爸爸。遇到这类事情，他们初为人父，通常忍受的痛苦最大。”医生说，“我得说，这位爸爸实在能沉得住气。”

说着，他将蒙在那个印第安人头上的毯子一把扯开。这一扯，他觉得手上湿乎乎的。他一手提起灯，踩到下铺的床沿上，查看了一下上铺，只见那个印第安人面朝墙躺着，喉咙已经彻底被割断，血流成河，聚积在他身子在床上压出来的深窝里。印第安人把头枕在自己的左胳膊上。一把剃刀打开着，刀锋朝上放在毯子上。

“快把尼克带出去，乔治！”医生说。

这已是多此一举了。父亲一手提灯，一手把印第安人的头向后推去时，尼克正站在厨房门口，一览无余地看见了上铺的情况。

父子俩沿着运木材的大路回到湖边时，天已开始放亮。

“都怪我，真不该带你来，尼克。”父亲说道。他做完手术后那种得意的劲儿彻底消失了。“这件事搞得一团糟，都让你看见了。”

“女人生孩子是不是都这么难呢？”尼克问。

“不，这是个例外，一个罕见的例外。”

“他为什么要自杀呢，爸爸？”

“我也不知道，尼克。我想他可能是受不了了。”

“自杀的男人是不是很多呢，爸爸？”

“不太多，尼克。”

“自杀的女人多不多？”

“很罕见。”

“到底有没有呢？”

“哦，有的。她们有时候也会自杀的。”

“爸爸！”

“怎么？”

“乔治大叔去哪儿了？”

“他会过来的。”

“死亡是件很难的事吗？”

“不难。我想是很容易的，尼克。这要看怎么说了。”

父子两人上了船。尼克坐在船尾，父亲划桨。太阳从山后冉冉升起。一条鲈鱼跃出水面，落下来在水中激起一圈涟漪。尼克把手伸进水里划动着。早晨的空气冰冷冷的，而水是温的。

清晨，坐在船尾行驶在湖面上，有父亲划桨，尼克心情笃定，觉得自己永远也不会死去。

三日狂风


尼克拐上了一条贯穿果园的小路。就在这时，雨停了。果子已经摘了，秋风呼呼地在光秃秃的树木间吹着。路边有只瓦格纳苹果躺在草丛里，由于被雨水洗过而闪着亮光。尼克停住脚步，把它捡起来，放入他那件厚呢短大衣的口袋里。

小路出了果园，蜿蜒抵达山头。山头上有座农舍，门廊里空无一人，烟囱里冒着烟。屋后有车库、鸡舍，还有一片二茬树，二茬树像一道藩篱，将后边的林子隔开。放眼望去，只见远处的大树在风中摇晃。这是秋季的第一场风暴。

尼克出了果园，穿过一片空地，农舍的房门打开了，比尔走了出来。比尔站在门廊那儿，向这边望着。

“你好，维米奇！”他说。

“你好，比尔！”尼克说，一边抬腿走上了台阶。

两人站在了一起，一道向远处眺望，目光越过田野，从果园上方飘过，再经过小路、山脚下的野地以及岬角处的树林，一直望向湖水。狂风卷过湖面，看得到十里岬那儿浪花翻涌。

“在刮大风呢。”尼克说。

“这场风要连着刮三天呢。”比尔说。

“你爸爸在家吗？”尼克问。

“不在。他拿着枪出门了。来，进来吧。”

尼克走进了农舍。壁炉里炉火熊熊。狂风吹来，吹得火呼呼地响。比尔急忙关上了门。

“喝一杯吧？”他说。

他转身去了厨房，拿来了两个杯子和一罐水。尼克伸手到壁炉架上取放在那儿的一瓶威士忌。

“可以吗？”他问。

“好的。”比尔说。

两人在炉火前坐下，开始喝掺水的爱尔兰威士忌。

“这酒挺好喝的，有一股烟草味。”尼克说，一边透过杯中的酒望着炉火。

“是泥炭味。”比尔说。

“怎么能往酒里加泥炭呢？”尼克说。

“加点泥炭是没什么大不了的。”比尔说。

“你见过泥炭吗？”尼克问。

“没见过。”比尔说。

“我也没见过。”尼克说。

他把脚放在炉边，鞋被火烤得冒着蒸汽。

“最好把你的鞋脱掉。”比尔说。

“我没有穿袜子。”

“你把鞋脱下来烤干，我去找双袜子来。”比尔说。他说完就上楼到小阁楼里去了。尼克听到了他在头顶走动的声音。阁楼没有天花板，直接处于屋顶之下。比尔父子以及尼克偶尔在里面睡睡觉。阁楼的后部有间更衣室。他们把小床移到雨水淋不着的地方，用橡胶罩子罩严。

比尔拿着一双厚厚的毛袜子走了下来。

“天晚了，不穿袜子走动起来不方便。”他说。

“真不愿穿袜子哟。”尼克说。他把袜子套到脚上，又一屁股坐回到椅子上，将两只脚架在炉火前的防护栏上。

“可别把防护栏弄坏了。”比尔说。尼克听了，急忙将脚移开，放到了壁炉旁。

“有什么书看看吗？”他问。

“只有报纸。”

“卡斯队(1)的战况如何？”

“两场都输给了巨人队(2)。”

“原本该赢的呀。”

“拱手把胜利送给了人家。”比尔说，“联合会里有好的球员，麦格劳(3)都会花钱买走，别的队根本没戏可唱。”

“他总不能都买走呀。”尼克说。

“反正他看上谁就买谁。”比尔说，“行不通，他就让球员产生不满情绪，乖乖地归顺于他。”

“海尼·齐姆就是一例。”尼克赞同地说。

“那个笨蛋会给他带来许多好处的。”

比尔说着站起了身。

“他可以为他得分。”尼克说。炉火的热气把他的腿烤得暖暖的。

“他还是个出色的外野手呢。”比尔说，“不过，他也有输球的时候。”

“麦格劳要他，恐怕正是因为这些。”尼克分析说。

“也许吧。”比尔同意了他的观点。

“里面肯定还会有更多不可告人的勾当。”尼克说。

“当然喽。不过，咱们远离他们，反而听到的内幕消息更真实。”

“这就跟买赛马票一样，眼睛看不到马，选择时反而更明智。”

“就是这个道理。”

比尔伸手取过酒瓶，一只大手把酒瓶整个儿握住，把威士忌倒入尼克递过来的酒杯里。

“掺多少水？”

“跟往常一样吧。”

斟完酒，比尔席地而坐，坐在了尼克座椅旁的地板上。

“秋天起风暴还怪好的，是不是？”尼克说。

“是挺不错的。”

“这可是一年中最好的时候了。”尼克说。

“待在城里可能会很惨吧？”比尔说。

“我很想看世界职业棒球大赛。”尼克说。

“哦，如今这样的赛事老是在纽约或费城举办。”比尔说，“这对咱们没一点好处。”

“不知道卡斯队能不能赢上那么一场。”

“这辈子怕是看不到了。”比尔说。

“可惜，他们会疯掉的。”尼克说。

“还记得火车出事之前他们的那种热血沸腾的样子吗？”

“当然记得！”尼克回忆起往事说道。

比尔伸手去拿扣在窗前桌子上的那本书，那是他去开门时放在那儿的。他一手端酒杯，一手拿书，把背靠在尼克的椅子上。

“你在看什么书？”

“《理查德·费福利尔》(4)。”

“这本书我是看不下去的。”

“还好吧。”比尔说，“反正这不是本糟糕的书，维米奇。”

“你这儿有没有别的我没有看过的书？”尼克问。

“《森林情侣》(5)你看过没有？”

“看过。书中的主人公每天夜里睡觉，两个人之间都要放一把出鞘的剑。”

“这是本好书，维米奇。”

“是本不错的书。有一点我始终不明白，他们中间放一把剑有什么用处呢？要放你得让剑锋始终朝上才行，因为平着放，你把身子滚过去也不会伤着你的。”

“那是一种象征。”比尔说。

“当然喽。”尼克说，“但那样做没有实际用处。”

“你看过《坚忍不拔》(6)吗？”

“那是本好书，”尼克说，“一本真正的好书。主人公家的老爷子把他看管得够紧的，眼睛就没有离开过。沃波尔的书，你还有什么？”

“《阴暗的森林》，”比尔说，“写的是俄罗斯发生的事情。”

“俄罗斯那边的情况他怎么了解呢？”尼克问。

“我也不知道。那些人神通广大，让人搞不清。也许他小的时候在那儿待过吧。反正俄罗斯的内幕他掌握的可真是不少。”

“我倒是想见上他一面。”尼克说。

“我想见的作家是切斯特顿(7)。”比尔说。

“真希望他此时就在跟前。”尼克说，“咱们明天可以带他一道去沃伊克斯钓鱼。”

“谁知道他喜欢不喜欢钓鱼呢。”比尔说。

“当然喜欢。”尼克说，“他一定还是个出类拔萃的钓鱼好手呢。你还记得他写的《飞行客栈》那本书吗？”

天使走出天堂，

赐给你一杯琼浆。

你谢过他的好心肠，

却把琼浆倒入水塘。

“是这样的。”尼克说，“我想他是个好人，人品比沃波尔强。”

“哦，他的确是个挺不错的人，”比尔说，“但沃波尔的作品却胜他一筹。”

“谁知道呢。”尼克说，“反正切斯特顿的东西挺经典。”

“沃波尔的东西也经典。”比尔寸步不让地说。

“希望他俩都能来这儿，”尼克说，“明天带他俩一起去沃伊克斯钓鱼。”

“来，喝酒，一醉方休。”比尔说。

“一醉方休。”尼克随声附和地说。

“我老爹是不会介意的。”比尔说。

“你敢肯定他不介意？”尼克说。

“我心里有数。”比尔说。

“我都有点醉了。”尼克说。

“你没有醉。”比尔说。

他从地板上站起身，去取那瓶威士忌。尼克把酒杯伸过去。比尔为他斟酒时，他的眼睛盯着杯口。

比尔斟酒只斟了半杯。

“你自己掺点水吧。”他说，“剩下的酒只够一杯了。”

“再没有了吗？”尼克问。

“有倒是还有许多，但爸爸只让喝已开了瓶的酒。”

“当然喽。”尼克说。

“他说自己开瓶喝酒，会变成酒鬼的。”比尔解释了一句。

“说的有道理。”尼克说。这让他很有感触。以前他可从未想到过这些。他老觉得一个人喝闷酒才会变成酒鬼。

“你老爹怎么样？”他充满敬意地问。

“还可以吧，”比尔说，“只是偶尔发发脾气。”

“他是个好人呀。”尼克说。他从水罐里往杯子里倒了些水，让水和威士忌酒液慢慢融合在一起。融合后，杯里的酒比水要多一些。

“一点不错，他是个好人。”比尔说。

“我家老爷子也挺好的。”尼克说。

“千真万确，他是个好人。”比尔说。

“他声称自己这一辈子滴酒不沾唇。”尼克说，口气就像是在宣布一项科学发现一样。

“哦，他是个医生嘛，而我老爹是个画家。区别就在于此。”

“他落下的遗憾可真不小。”尼克忧伤地说。

“仁者见仁，智者见智。”比尔说，“各有利弊吧。”

“他自己说落下了很大遗憾。”尼克推心置腹地说。

“哎，当爸爸的都不容易呀。”比尔说。

“各有各难念的经。”尼克说。

他们坐在那儿，眼睛望着火，心里想着这条深奥的道理。

“我去后门廊取点木柴来。”尼克说。他在往火里望时，注意到火快熄灭了。同时，他想显示自己酒量大，没有喝糊涂。虽说他父亲滴酒不沾唇，可他并不是想灌醉就能灌醉的。

“那就把山毛榉木柴拿来一大块吧。”比尔说。听得出来，他也想显示出自己没有喝糊涂。

尼克抱着木柴进了屋，经过厨房时，不小心将厨房桌子上的一只平底锅碰到了地上。他把木柴放下，捡起了平底锅。锅里原来盛着杏干，用水浸泡着。他小心翼翼地将掉在地上的杏干一一捡起。有几个杏干滚到了炉子底下。然后，他把杏干放回锅里，从桌旁的桶里舀了些水浸泡。他很为自己感到得意，因为他没有喝醉，头脑十分清醒。

见他抱着木柴走进屋，比尔急忙从椅子上站起，帮着他将木柴加进火里。

“这么一大段木头真棒。”尼克说。

“一直留着呢，留着天气变坏时烧。”比尔说。

“这么一段木柴能烧一整夜。”

“烧剩下来的木炭早晨还可以用来生火。”尼克说。

“一点不错。”比尔赞同地说。

两人越说越投机。

“再喝上一杯吧。”尼克说。

“柜子里可能还有开了瓶的酒呢。”比尔说。

他走到墙角那儿的柜子前，跪在地上，取出一个方形的酒瓶来。

“这是苏格兰威士忌。”他说道。

“我去再弄些水来。”尼克说。说完，他又去了厨房，用水瓢从桶里舀出冰凉的泉水，把水罐灌满。回客厅的路上经过餐厅里的一面镜子，他顺便照了照，发现自己的脸怪怪的。他朝镜中的那张脸笑笑，那张脸也冲他笑笑。随后，他对着它挤了挤眼，就又朝前走了。他觉得那好像就不是他的脸。不过，他才不管那是不是他的脸呢。

此时，比尔已经把酒斟好。

“好大的一杯酒，怪吓人的。”尼克说。

“这对咱俩不在话下，维米奇。”比尔说。

“这次为什么干杯呢？”尼克举杯在手，问了一声。

“就为钓鱼干杯吧。”比尔说。

“好吧。”尼克说，“诸位，我提议为钓鱼干杯！”

“为钓鱼干杯！”比尔说，“祝处处钓鱼成功！”

“干杯！”尼克说，“为钓鱼干杯！”

“这总比为棒球干杯强。”比尔说。

“这中间没有什么可比性。”尼克说，“不明白咱们刚才为什么要对棒球大谈特谈呢？”

“那叫大错特错。”比尔说，“棒球是下等人的运动。”

两人一仰脖子，干光了杯子里的酒。

“接下来该为切斯特顿干杯了。”

“还有沃波尔。”尼克插嘴说。

尼克斟酒，比尔往酒里掺水。两人你看看我，我看看你，感觉好极了。

“诸位，”比尔说道，“我提议为切斯特顿和沃波尔干杯！”

“干杯，诸位！”尼克说。

两人一饮而尽。比尔又把酒斟满。随后，他们在火炉前的大椅子上坐了下来。

“你是非常明智的，维米奇。”比尔说。

“此话怎讲？”尼克问。

“就是了结掉和玛姬的那段感情呗。”比尔说。

“我想是吧。”尼克说。

“只能来个快刀斩乱麻了。假如当初你优柔寡断，那么你现在就得回家埋头苦干，攒钱结婚喽。”

尼克没有吭气。

“男人结了婚就等于跳进了火坑。”比尔继续侃侃而谈，“他会一无所有，丧失掉一切，狗屁都不会给他剩下。一句话：完啦！你也见了结过婚的男人最后的下场。”

尼克一言不发。

“从外表就能看得出哪些是婚后男子。”比尔说，“他们有着婚后男子的那种傻呆呆的表情。他们都玩儿完了。”

“的确如此。”尼克说。

“一刀两断，也许会难过一时。”比尔说，“不过，天涯何处无芳草！旧情会忘掉的。有了新欢，也不要让她们断送掉你。”

“是呀。”尼克说。

“娶了一个女人，就是娶了她全家。别忘了她是有妈妈的，还有她妈妈嫁的那个家伙。”

尼克点了点头。

“想想看，那一家子会在你家团团转。星期天，你到她娘家吃饭，而娘家的人也会来你家聚餐。你岳母会给玛姬出各种各样的馊主意，颐指气使的。”

尼克一声不响地坐着。

“你及时脱身不失为上策。”比尔说，“她可以嫁个跟她气味相投的人嘛，安安心心过她的小日子呗。鱼找鱼虾找虾，油和水是不能掺和在一起的，而我就不能和为斯特拉顿家干活的艾达成为并蒂莲。艾达倒是很愿意跟我喜结连理哩。”

尼克没有作声。此时他酒意全消，倍感孤独，仿佛比尔不在跟前，仿佛他不是坐在火炉前边，仿佛根本没有明天要跟比尔父子去垂钓那档子事。他没有喝醉，心里空荡荡的。他只知道自己曾经拥有过马乔里(8)，后来却失去了她。她走了，是他把她打发走的。这才是问题的关键之处。他再也见不到她了，恐怕今生今世也见不到了。所有的恩恩怨怨都已成为过去。

“再来一杯吧。”尼克说。

比尔把酒斟上，尼克加了些水进去。

“假如你当初走了那条道，咱们今日就不能在此相聚了。”比尔说。

这倒是真的。他最初的计划是回老家找个活干。后来他又打算去沙勒沃伊待上一个冬天，守在玛姬的身旁。而现在他心乱如麻，都不知道该如何是好了。

“那一来，就连明天钓鱼恐怕也去不成了。”比尔说，“你做出了正确选择，这一点无可厚非。”

“我那样也是迫不得已呀。”尼克说。

“这我清楚。事情只能如此。”比尔说。

“眨眼之间，一切都消失了。”尼克说，“我对此都理不出个头绪来了。当时，身不由己地就那样做了。就好像当下刮了三日狂风，树上的叶子都被吹掉了。”

“哦，过去的均已过去。这是问题的关键。”比尔说。

“过错在我身上。”尼克说。

“孰是孰非是没有任何关系的。”比尔说。

“我觉得还是有关系的。”比尔说。

马乔里走了，今生今世恐怕再也见不到她了，这可是件不容忽视的大事。他曾经信誓旦旦，说要和她一道去意大利游玩，说他们一定会度过一段快乐的时光。他还说要和她一起去别的地方观光。如今，这一切都无法实现了。

“了结了一件麻烦事，这才是至关紧要的。”比尔说，“说真的，维米奇，我那时实在为你捏把汗呢。你那样做是正确的。听说她妈妈气得要发疯。她逢人便讲，说你们俩已经订了婚呢。”

“我们没订婚。”尼克说。

“街坊里传得沸沸扬扬，说你们订婚了。”

“他们那样说，我也没办法。”尼克说，“我们的确没有订婚。”

“你们有没有打算，准备结婚呢？”比尔问。

“有，但我们没有订婚。”尼克说。

“那又有什么区别呢？”比尔问道，就像依法断案一样。

“说不清。但区别是有的。”

“我实在看不出来。”比尔说。

“算啦，”尼克说，“还是喝酒吧，喝它个烂醉。”

“好吧，”比尔说，“那咱们就喝个烂醉。”

“来，喝个痛快，然后游泳去。”尼克说。

他说完干光了杯子里的酒。

“对于她，我内疚得要命。可我又有什么办法呢？”他说道，“你也知道她妈妈是个母老虎！”

“是个非常可怕的母老虎！”比尔说。

“突然之间一切都过去了。”尼克说，“我真不该旧事重提。”

“不是你旧事重提，”比尔说，“是我提起了那件往事。就此打住，从今往后谁也不要再提它了。你可不要把这件事挂在心上，否则你又会陷入痛苦的旋涡。”

尼克在这之前没有再想此事，因为覆水难收，事情已无法挽回。比尔的观点让他感觉好了些。

“的确如此，”他说，“的确有这种危险。”

他的心情又好了起来。看来，世界上没有改变不了的局面。星期六的晚上，他可以进城去散散心。今天已经是星期四了。

“机会总是会有的。”他说。

“你自己得去寻找。”比尔说。

“我会留心的。”他说。

他感到很高兴，觉得自己并没有走上绝路，并没有失去什么。星期六他一定要进城去放松放松。他的一颗心顿时觉得轻快了，就跟比尔未提及此事之前一样轻快。活人哪能让尿憋死，出路总是会有的。

“走，咱们拿上枪到岬角那儿找你老爹去。”他说。

“好的。”

比尔说完，从墙上的枪架上取下两支猎枪，把子弹盒打开取出子弹。尼克穿上了他的那件厚呢短大衣，把鞋蹬在脚上。他的鞋已烤干，变得硬邦邦的。他仍然醉醺醺的，但大脑却是清晰的。

“你感觉怎么样？”他问道。

“感觉很好。只是有一点醉意罢了。”比尔一边扣毛衣上的扣子，一边回答说。

“喝得酩酊大醉绝对没有好处。”

“是的。该去外边透透气。”

两人走到了门外。外边狂风大作，刮得正紧。

“看这风势，鸟儿会躲进草丛里的。”尼克说。

他们走下山，朝着果园走去。

“今天早晨我看见了一只丘鹬。”比尔说。

“也许咱们会撞上它呢。”尼克说。

“这么大的风，开枪是打不准的。”比尔说。

到了户外，关于玛姬的那件事好像就不那么惨了，甚至显得无关紧要了。狂风把一切烦恼都吹得无影无踪了。

“这风是从大湖那边刮过来的。”尼克说。

逆着风向，他们听见了砰的一声枪响。

“是我老爹，”比尔说，“他在山下的沼泽地那边。”

“走，咱们到那边去。”尼克说。

“咱们穿过草地走，看是不是能撞上什么猎物。”比尔说。

“好的。”尼克说。

往事已经无关紧要了。狂风吹走了他心里的忧愁。星期六的晚上他可以进城去乐一乐。事情经常会峰回路转、柳暗花明的。

拳击手


尼克站起身，发现自己并无大碍。顺着铁轨望去，只见货车末尾列车员专用车厢里那闪烁的灯光转过弯道就消失不见了。铁轨两旁净是水，再往远处则是点缀着落地松的沼泽地。

他摸了摸膝盖，看见裤子都破了，皮肤擦出了伤。他的两只手也伤痕累累，指甲缝里塞满了沙土和煤渣。于是他走下铁轨，沿斜坡走到水边洗手。他在冷水里洗手，洗得很仔细，将指甲缝里的脏东西清除干净。接着，他蹲下身子开始洗膝盖。

那个司闸员真他妈不是个东西。君子报仇十年不晚，早晚都要跟他算这笔账。有仇不报非君子。

“过来，小伙子！”那个司闸员刚才对他这样说道，“我这儿有样东西给你。”

他竟然上当了。那种小儿科般的把戏竟然骗过了他。这辈子他再也不会上那样的当了。

“过来，小伙子，我这儿有样东西给你。”就这么一句话让他上了当。接着，他嗵的一声被扔到了铁轨旁，两手和双膝着地伏在地面上。

他揉了揉眼睛——那儿起了个大包，肯定都青肿了，感觉疼疼的。那个司闸员真他妈是个龟儿子！

他用手指碰了碰眼睛上方的肿块。哦，还好吧，只不过眼睛有些青肿罢了。他受到的损失就是这些了，代价还不算沉重嘛。他很想看看自己此时的面相，只可惜从水里是看不清的。天色已黑，他身处野外，前不着村后不着店。他在裤子上擦擦手，然后站起来，爬上路堤向铁轨走去。

他沿着铁轨朝前走，脚下的石块铺得很均匀，走起来顺顺当当的。枕木间的沙子和砾石极其紧凑，踩在上面觉得很坚实。平展的路基像一条堤坝，穿过沼泽地一直向前延伸。他脚下不停朝前走，心想得赶快找个休息的地方。

他是在沃尔顿枢纽站扒上这列货车的。当时，货车在枢纽站外的调车场减慢了速度。天擦黑的时候，货车开过了卡尔卡斯卡。此刻，他八成是在距离曼瑟洛纳不远的地方。到那儿去，要穿过三四英里的沼泽地。他不敢耽搁，继续向前走着，两脚踩在枕木间的碎石上。雾气越来越浓，而沼泽地在雾气里显得有些狰狞。他眼睛疼痛难忍，腹中饥肠辘辘，而脚下却走个不停，把好长好长的铁轨抛在了身后。铁轨两旁的景色仍没有改变，仍是无涯无际的沼泽地。

前边出现了一座路桥。过桥时，靴子踩在铁轨上发出空洞的响声。从枕木间的缝隙朝脚下看，看见的是黑魆魆的水面。有枚道钉松了，他用脚一踢，那枚道钉掉进了水里。过了桥就是群山了，又黑又高，耸立在轨道两旁。他看见前边有火光。

他沿着铁轨走，小心翼翼地向火光靠近。那火光在铁轨的一侧，远在路堤下方，仅看得见火光却看不见火。铁轨穿过一个山口，进入一片林子，中间的野地被火光照得通亮。他蹑手蹑脚走下路堤进入林子，穿过林海向篝火摸去。这是一片山毛榉树林，在林间走动，掉落的山毛榉坚果踩在脚下感觉毛刺刺的。篝火位于林边，火光熊熊的。在火的旁边坐着一个男子。尼克躲在树后观察了一番。那男子好像是独身一人，双手捧着脑袋，眼睛望着篝火。尼克从树后闪出，走到了火光里。

那男子坐着没动，仍在望着篝火发呆。尼克走到他跟前，停下脚步时，他也没动。

“你好！”尼克说道。

那男子抬起了头。

“你的黑眼圈是怎么回事？”他问。

“是被一个司闸员打的。”

“是货车上的司闸员？”

“是的。”

“我看见那兔崽子了。”男子说，“那趟车大概在一个半小时前从这儿开了过去。那家伙在车厢顶上走来走去，用手拍着胳膊，还唱歌哩。”

“那个狗杂种！”

“他打你，心里一定快活得不行。”男子语气严峻地说。

“我会叫他吃不了兜着走的。”

“下次见了他，就用石头砸他。”男子献计说。

“我一定会找他算这笔账的。”

“看来你是条硬汉子，对不对？”

“算不上吧。”尼克回答道。

“你们这班小子，都有硬汉风格。”

“为人处世，这也是迫不得已呀。”尼克说。

“这正是我要说的。”

那男子看看尼克，笑了笑。借着火光，尼克发现他的脸是一副怪相——鼻子塌陷，眼睛细成了一条缝，嘴唇扭曲得变了形。起初，尼克并没有一下子把这些细节都收入眼底。他只看到男子的脸奇形怪状，被人毁了容，呈铁灰色，在火光里看上去像死人脸。

“你不喜欢我的面相吧？”男子问。

尼克听了觉得很不好意思。

“没有的事。”他支吾了一句。

“叫你看个仔细！”男子说完摘下了头上的帽子。

原来他只有一只耳朵，厚墩墩的，紧贴在脑袋的一侧。脑袋的另一侧没有耳朵，仅有一个耳朵根。

“见过这样的面相吗？”

“没见过。”尼克说。说这话时，他觉得有点恶心。

“这样的命运我能忍受得了。”男子说，“难道你不觉得我能忍受得了吗，小伙子？”

“当然能！”

“他们的拳头雨点般落在我身上，”小个子男子说，“却伤不着我。”

他把尼克打量了几眼，然后说道：“坐下吧。想吃东西吗？”

“不用麻烦了。”尼克说，“我只是路过这儿，要到城里去呢。”

“听着，”男子说，“就叫我阿德吧。”

“明白了！”

“听着，”小个子男子说，“我这人不太正常。”

“怎么啦？”

“我有疯病。”他说着把帽子又戴到了头上。

尼克直想笑，连忙说：“你很正常。”

“不，不正常。我发疯了。问你一句，你发过疯吗？”

“没发过。”尼克说，“怎么会这样呢？”

“我也弄不清。”阿德说，“你一旦发了疯，自己是不知道的。你该认识我吧？”

“不认识。”

“我是阿德·弗朗西斯。”

“这是真的吗？”

“难道你不相信？”

“我相信。”尼克知道对方说的是实话。

“你知道我是怎么把他们击败的吗？”

“不知道。”尼克说。

“我的心脏跳动得很慢，一分钟只跳四十下。你来摸摸脉就知道了。”

尼克一时有点犹豫。

“来呀，”男子一把拉起他的手说，“抓住我的手腕，把手指按在这地方。”

小个子男子的手腕很粗，包在骨头上的肌肉高高隆起。尼克的手指尖可以感觉到他的脉搏跳动得很慢。

“你有表吗？”

“没有。”

“我也没有。”阿德说，“没有表就测不准。”

尼克一听放下了他的手腕。

“这样吧，”阿德·弗朗西斯说，“你再抓住我的手腕。你数脉搏，我数时间——一分钟六十下。”

尼克把手按在他的脉搏上，感受到他的脉搏在有力、缓慢地跳动，接着就开始数数。他听见小个子阿德也在大声数：“一，二，三，四，五……”

“六十。”阿德数完了，“正好一分钟。你数的是多少？”

“是四十。”尼克说。

“这个数是对的。”阿德高兴地说，“从来就没有跳快过。”

这时，一个人下了铁路的路堤，穿过空地向篝火这儿走来。

“你好，巴格思！”阿德招呼道。

“你好！”巴格思答了一声。听声音像是个黑人。尼克从他走路的姿势也看得出他是个黑人。他背对他们站着，俯下身子在烤火。此时直起了腰来。

“这位是我的朋友巴格思，”阿德介绍说，“他也是个疯子。”

“幸会幸会。”巴格思说，“你是哪个地方来的？”

“芝加哥。”尼克说。

“那是个漂亮的城市。”黑人说，“请问尊姓大名。”

“我叫亚当斯——尼克·亚当斯。”

“他说他从未发过疯，巴格思。”阿德说。

“以后他遇到事就会的。”黑人说着话，傍着火光解开了一个包裹。

“什么时候吃饭呀，巴格思？”职业拳击手阿德问。

“马上就吃。”

“你肚子饿不饿，尼克？”

“饿得要死。”

“听见了吧，巴格思？”

“你们的话基本上都听见了。”

“真是答非所问。”

“是的。这位先生的话我听见了。”

巴格思说着话，把切成片的火腿放入煎锅。当煎锅烧热，锅里的油嗞啦嗞啦发响时，他便弯下他那双黑人天生的长腿蹲到篝火旁，翻了翻火腿，往锅里打几个鸡蛋，再将煎锅左晃右晃，用热油慢慢煨熟鸡蛋。

“能不能把包里的面包切几片下来，亚当斯先生？”巴格思从火旁转过头问。

“当然可以喽。”尼克说完，伸手从包里取出一条面包，用刀子切下来了六片。阿德在旁边看着，把身子探了过来。

“把你的刀子给我吧，尼克。”他说道。

“不，别给他。”黑人说，“你把你的刀子拿好，别给他，亚当斯先生。”

职业拳击手阿德又坐了回去。

“把面包递给我好吗，亚当斯先生？”巴格思问。尼克听了把面包递了过去。

“你的面包喜欢蘸点火腿油吃吗？”黑人问。

“喜欢！”

“也许，最好还是等一下再说吧。作为收尾的一道菜效果更佳。来啦。”

黑人拿起一片火腿放在一片面包上，又摊了个鸡蛋在上边。

“请你把这个三明治夹好，递给弗朗西斯。”

阿德接过三明治，吃了起来。

“小心点，别让鸡蛋流下来。”黑人提醒道，“这个是给你的，亚当斯先生。其余的我吃。”

尼克咬了一口三明治。黑人坐在阿德的旁边，跟他面对面。火腿煎鸡蛋热乎乎的，吃起来非常可口。

“亚当斯先生看来真是饿坏了。”黑人说。此时，小个子拳击手一声不吭——尼克早就闻其大名，知道他是个拳击冠军。自从黑人不让尼克把刀子给他那一时刻起，他一直没有开过口。

“给你来片面包，蘸点热火腿油怎么样？”巴格思问。

“多谢啦。”

尼克说话时，小个子白人扫了他几眼。

“你也来点吧，阿道夫(1)·弗朗西斯先生？”巴格思从煎锅里取了片面包说。

阿德没有答话，却仍在盯着尼克瞧。

“弗朗西斯先生？”黑人口吻柔和地叫了一声。

阿德仍未吱声，还在盯着尼克瞧。

“我在和你说话呢，弗朗西斯先生。”黑人又柔声细语地说了一句。

阿德不住眼地盯着尼克，帽檐拉得低低的遮在眼睛上方，让尼克感到心里发毛。

“你是吃了熊心豹子胆了吧？”那个帽檐下传来了阿德冲着尼克发出的喝问，“你他妈觉得自己算老几？你个目中无人的杂种！谁也没请你，你就跑到这儿来，混吃混喝的。别人问你借借刀子，你倒拿腔拿调的。”

他怒视着尼克，脸色发白，眼睛遮在帽檐下，几乎让人看不见。

“你倒成了个香饽饽。究竟是谁把你请到这里来的？”

“没人请。”

“你说的一点不错。没人请你来，也没人请你留下。你大大咧咧跑来，对我的面相嗤之以鼻，抽我的烟，喝我的酒，说起话来大言不惭的。你他妈想怎么样嘛？”

尼克无言以对。阿德站起了身子。

“告诉你吧，你这个胆小的芝加哥的杂种，我要让你吃不了兜着走。明白了吗？”

尼克节节后退，而小个子拳击手却步步紧逼，步伐缓慢，左脚迈前，右脚便紧跟上。

“来打我呀。”他把脑袋一歪说，“来呀，来打呀。”

“我不想跟你打架。”

“你别指望就这么算啦。我要让你好好挨一顿揍，明白吗？来吧，你应该先下手。”

“还是算了吧。”尼克说。

“那好，狗杂种，那就瞧吧。”

小个子说着低头看了看尼克的脚。说时迟那时快，自从他离开篝火旁的那一刻起一直跟在他身后的黑人举起裹着布的金属棒，砰地打在了他的后脑壳上。他一个狗吃屎栽倒了。巴格思将手中的金属棒丢在了草地上。小个子趴在那里，脸埋在草中。黑人将他抱起，抱到篝火旁。他耷拉着脑袋，脸色吓人，眼睛睁开着。巴格思轻手轻脚把他放了下来。

“麻烦你把那桶水给我拎过来，亚当斯先生。”巴格思说道，“恐怕我刚才下手重了点。”

黑人用手往小个子的脸上泼了点水，轻轻扯扯他的耳朵。对方把眼睛合上了。

巴格思直起了腰。

“没事的。”他说道，“你不用担心。对不起了，亚当斯先生。”

“没关系的。”尼克低头看了看脚下的小个子，结果瞧见那根金属棒在草地上，便将其捡了起来。金属棒的柄有点弹性，抓在手里软软的。棒柄上裹着旧旧的黑皮革，沉重的棒端则用手帕包裹着。

“这是个鲸骨柄。”黑人微微一笑说，“这种东西现在已经没人做了。对于你的自卫能力，我一无所知。反正我是不想让你伤着他，给他的脸上添更多的疤痕。”

黑人说完又是一笑。

“倒是你刚才那一下子把他伤着了。”

“我掌握得了轻重。他醒了后狗屁都不会记得了。是在他发疯的时候我才会出手的，让他换一种状态。”

尼克此时仍在低头看小个子，看着他躺在那里，在火光中闭着眼睛。巴格思朝篝火里又加了些木柴。

“你不必再为他担心了，亚当斯先生。他这种样子，我都多见不怪了。”

“他怎么会突然发疯呢？”尼克问。

“哦，其中的原因有许多。”黑人从篝火旁回答说，“想来杯咖啡吗，亚当斯先生？”

他说着把咖啡递给了尼克，然后将刚才放在昏迷不醒的小个子头下的衣服拉展。

“其中一个原因是，他挨打挨得次数太多了。”黑人呷了口咖啡说，“这只是让他的脑子缺了根弦。当时，他的阿妹当他的经纪人，报纸上大秀阿哥和阿妹的恩爱，什么阿妹爱阿哥啦，阿哥心疼阿妹啦。结果，两人在纽约结了婚，弄得满城风雨。”

“这事我记得。”

“当然，他们并非胞兄胞妹，只不过是两个傻瓜罢了。可是，许多人却不管那一套。两人之间也闹起了矛盾。一天，女的跑了，再也没有回来。”

黑人说完，用粉红色的手心抹了一把嘴。

“这就是他发疯的原因。再来点咖啡吧，亚当斯先生？”

“谢谢。”

“那女的我见过几次。”黑人继续叙说着，“她模样儿长得真是俊，和他简直是天设地造的一对儿。他要不是毁了容，原本也是个帅哥呢。”

他打住了话头。故事像是讲完了。

“我是在监狱里遇到的他。”黑人又说了起来，“那女的跑了后，他动辄就打人，于是就进了牢房。我坐牢是因为砍伤了一个人。”

他笑了笑，换上一种温柔的语调继续说道：

“见第一面，我就喜欢上了他，出狱后紧紧跟着他。他老是觉得我有点犯傻，可我一点不在乎。我愿意跟着他，愿意多见世面。跟着他，就不用偷鸡摸狗了。我喜欢过体面的日子。”

“你们平时都做些什么呢？”尼克问。

“哦，什么都不做，只是周游四方。他反正是不愁钱花的。”

“那他的钱一定是很多喽。”

“不错，不过都被他花光了，或者说都被他人拿走了。现在是那女的给他寄钱花。”

说到这里，黑人拨了拨火。

“那女的真是好样的，很了不起。”他继续说道，“她跟他像极了，像一个模子倒出来的。”

黑人望了望小个子——小个子躺在那儿，大口大口呼吸着，一头金发披散在脑门上，毁了容的脸看上去像孩子一样。

“我随时都可以把他叫醒的，亚当斯先生。如果你不介意，我觉得你还是现在就走吧。我这可不是不愿款待你，只是害怕他醒来后见到你又犯老毛病。用棒子敲他是我所不愿做的，可他一发疯，也只有这么做了。如此，只好叫他少接触人。你不会介意吧，亚当斯先生？不用谢我，不用谢我，亚当斯先生。我早该提醒你。让你注意他了。可是话又说回来，他好像挺喜欢你的，所以我觉得不会出事的。沿着铁轨朝北走两英里的样子就到城里了。他们管那儿叫曼瑟洛纳。再见！真希望能留下你过夜，可是这样又是不可能的。愿意带上点火腿和面包吗？不愿带？那你还是带一份三明治吧。”黑人的这一席话说得彬彬有礼，声音柔和，压得低低的。

“好吧。那就再见了，亚当斯先生。祝你好运！”

尼克离开篝火，穿过空地向铁轨那儿走去。走到篝火的光圈之外，他竖起耳朵听了听，听见黑人那低沉、柔和的声音在说话。黑人究竟说了什么，他听不清，却听得到小个子在说：“我的头疼得厉害，巴格思。”

“你会没事的，弗朗西斯先生。”黑人的声音在说宽心话，“把这杯热咖啡喝下去就好了。”

尼克爬上路堤，沿着铁轨走了。这时他发现自己手里还拿着一份火腿三明治，于是就将它放进了衣兜里。铁轨蜿蜒至山里。在未进山之前，他从陡坡上回头看了一眼，看见篝火在空地上熊熊燃烧着。

艾略特夫妇


艾略特两口子想生个孩子，为之付出了很大的努力。他们一次次地尝试，只要艾略特夫人能受得了就不停止。他们婚后在波士顿尝试，即便乘船在海上航行也不放松。乘船时尝试的次数倒不是很多，因为艾略特夫人晕船晕得厉害。一上船就晕，晕了就呕吐——南方的女人都一个样。美利坚的南国女子就是这么一种状况。艾略特夫人也别无二致，晕船晕得稀里哗啦，立刻就垮掉了，可能是因为夜间航行，白天起得太早的缘故吧。船上许多乘客都错把她当成艾略特的妈妈了。知道他们是夫妻的人则以为她怀孕了。其实，她才不过四十岁而已。一出来旅行，她突然间就显出了老相。

以前，她显得非常面嫩。实际上，艾略特跟她喜结连理时，她显得年轻极了，根本看不出她的岁数。艾略特是在她工作的那个茶馆和她相识的，交往了很长一段时间后，一天晚上吻了她，再经过几个星期的追求，最后步入了婚姻的殿堂。

结婚时，休伯特·艾略特正在哈佛大学读法学专业的研究生。他是个诗人，每年有近一万元的进项。他擅长于写长诗，写起来一挥而就。他当时二十五岁，在和艾略特夫人结婚之前，从未跟任何一个女人上过床。他洁身自好，准备把纯洁的心和身体献给妻子——他渴望从妻子那儿得到同样的回报。他称这种生活为“过本分日子”。在亲吻艾略特夫人之前，他跟各种各样的姑娘相恋过，或迟或早都会告诉对方，说自己要过的是洁净无瑕的生活。几乎所有的姑娘一听，都对他失去了兴趣。姑娘们明明知道一些男子不检点，乌七八糟的，却愿意跟他们私定终身，以身相许，这叫他非常吃惊、万分愕然。一次，他试图告诫自己认识的一位姑娘，说她爱的男子在学校里劣迹斑斑，对此有证据可查，结果讨了个没趣。

艾略特夫人的闺名叫科妮莉亚。她却让他称她为卡鲁蒂娜——这是她在南方家中用的小名。婚后，他带着科妮莉亚回家探亲，妈妈见了竟然哭了起来，待到得知他们新婚宴尔要到海外定居时，便破涕为笑，喜色满面。

当他告诉科妮莉亚，说他为了她一直保持着清白之身时，科妮莉亚说了声“你真是个可爱的小男孩”，把他搂得更紧了。科妮莉亚本人也守身如玉。“再亲亲我！”她这样说道。

休伯特向她透露，说他亲吻的技巧还是听一个伙计讲故事，从中学到的。他热衷于实践，于是两人乐此不疲，令这门技巧愈加娴熟。有时他们热吻，一吻就是很长时间。这时，科妮莉亚会让他重申：他保持着清白之身全是为了她。他的重申往往又会叫她激情勃发。

起初，休伯特并无娶她之心。他从未有过与她结婚的念头。他们俩不过是好朋友罢了。一天，科妮莉亚的闺蜜在茶馆的前厅待客，他们俩跑到后边的小房间里跟着留声机的音乐跳舞。跳着跳着，她抬起头凝视着他的眼睛，于是他就吻了她。他记不起他们是何时决定结婚的——反正两人结了百年之好。

他们的新婚之夜是在波士顿的一家旅馆里度过的。两人都有点失望。不过，最后，科妮莉亚睡着了。而休伯特却难以入睡，于是三番五次跑出去，穿着那件专门为蜜月旅行新买的毛织品浴袍，在旅馆的走廊里来回踱步。他看见各房间的门外摆放着形形色色的鞋，有大的，也有小的，不由怦然心跳不止，急忙回到自己的房间里，可是科妮莉亚却在呼呼大睡。他不愿叫醒她。不一会儿，他的心归于平静，接着便安然入梦了。

翌日，两人前去探望了他的母亲。第二天，夫妻俩启程，远航欧洲了。他们渴望要一个孩子，这是他们的天字号愿望，原本可以在船上努力实现的，只可惜科妮莉亚不能够进行多次的尝试。他们是在瑟堡(1)登陆的，然后来到了巴黎。在巴黎，他们又进行了尝试，想怀上孩子。后来，他们决定到第戎(2)去，那儿开了个暑期班，和他们同船而来的乘客有好几个都去上那个班了。到了第戎，他们发现自己无事可做。幸亏休伯特创作了许多诗歌，于是科妮莉亚便为他打字。那些诗全都长得要命。他又是个严苛的人，不允许出错，一旦打字时出现一个错误，她就得把整整一页重新打一遍。为此，她流过不少眼泪。在离开第戎之前，他们又屡屡尝试，想把孩子怀上。

末了，他们返回了巴黎，他们在船上的旅伴也大多来到了这里。大家对第戎都感到厌倦了。反正他们现在可以吹吹牛了，说他们离开美国的大学（或哈佛大学，或哥伦比亚大学，或沃巴什大学）跑到法国的柯多尔省，在该省的第戎大学曾经学习过。如果郎格多克(3)、蒙彼利埃(4)或佩皮尼昂有大学的话，他们当中有许多人情愿到那些地方去。不过，话又说回来，那些地方太远了。第戎距离巴黎只有四个半小时的车程，而且火车上还设有餐厅。

现在回到巴黎，大家齐聚圆顶屋咖啡馆。他们尽量不去街对面的罗敦德咖啡馆，因为那儿人满为患，外来客太多。热闹了几天之后，艾略特夫妇通过纽约《先驱报》上登的一则广告，在都兰租了一座别墅。此时，艾略特已结交了一些朋友，那些人很欣赏他的诗。艾略特夫人说服丈夫寄信波士顿，邀请她在茶馆的那位闺蜜来陪她。闺蜜来后，艾略特夫人的情绪好多了。两人喜相逢，洒下了不少相思泪。闺蜜比科妮莉亚大几岁，一声一声地把她叫作“宝贝”。她也出身于一个古老的南方世家。

他们三人，再加上艾略特的几个朋友（那些朋友把他叫休比(5)），大家一起来到了都兰的别墅。他们发现都兰一马平川，天气炎热，很像美国的堪萨斯。此时，艾略特创作的诗歌差不多都够出一部诗集了。他准备把诗集在波士顿推出，已经给出版商寄了支票，并签了合同。

没过多长时间，那些朋友们陆陆续续回巴黎去了。都兰没有他们初来时所感觉的那么好玩。朋友们一哄而散，跟一个有钱的未婚年轻诗人跑了，跑到特鲁维尔附近的海滨度假地去了，在那儿玩得非常开心。

艾略特继续留在都兰的别墅里，因为他的租期是整整一个夏天。在热烘烘的大卧室里，躺在一张巨大的硬床上，两口子进行了艰苦卓绝的努力，一个心眼要怀上孩子。艾略特夫人在学习打字的指法，可她发现用学到的指法倒是能够加快速度，出错率却也增加了。实际上，现在所有的稿件都由她的闺蜜负责打印。闺蜜打字干净利落，效率高，而且乐在其中。

艾略特喜欢上了喝白葡萄酒，独自住一个房间。他夜间熬夜写诗，白天倦容满面。艾略特夫人和闺蜜睡在那张中世纪的大床上，常常多愁善感地洒几滴眼泪。傍晚时分，三人到花园里坐在一棵法国梧桐树下共进晚餐。艾略特喝着白葡萄酒，艾略特夫人则和闺蜜谈天说地，日子过得倒是相当滋润。

雨中的猫


旅馆里下榻的美国客人仅有两个。他们进出房间，上下楼时遇见的人一个都不认识。他们住的房间在二楼，面向大海。对面还有一个公园和一座战争纪念碑。公园里有参天的棕榈树以及绿颜色的长条凳。遇到好天气，总会看到一个画家拿着画架出现在公园里。画家都喜欢这样的景色：棕榈树参天；旅馆色彩艳丽，面向着公园和大海。总有意大利人赶老远的路跑来瞻仰战争纪念碑。纪念碑是青铜铸成的，淋了雨就闪闪发亮。此时正在下雨，淅淅沥沥的雨水从棕榈树上朝下滴着。砾石路上积了一洼一洼的水。雨幕中，海水排成一长列冲上海滩，再退回去，然后又排成一长列冲过来。停放在战争纪念碑旁广场上的几辆汽车，一辆辆都开走了。广场对面一家咖啡馆的门洞里有个服务生，正站在那儿望着空旷的广场发呆。

那个美国太太站在窗前朝外望着。在屋外的窗户根下有只猫，蜷缩在一张滴着水的绿桌子下。那只猫尽量把身子缩紧，免得让雨水淋着。

“我下去把那只小猫抱回来。”美国太太说。

“还是我去吧。”丈夫从床上说了一声。

“不，我去吧。瞧那可怜的小家伙，躲在桌子下不愿让雨淋着。”

丈夫听了，又继续看他的书了，斜躺在床的一端，身后垫着两个枕头。

“可别让雨淋着。”他叮咛了一句。

妻子下楼去了，路过办公室时，旅馆老板急忙站起来，向她欠欠身子致意。他的桌子摆放在办公室的另一头。他是个老头，身材特别高。

“天下雨了。(1)”美国太太寒暄道。她喜欢这位旅馆老板。

“是呀，是呀，天不好。(2)天气太糟糕了。”

老板站在桌子后边，在办公室远远的另一端，屋里光线昏暗。美国太太喜欢他，喜欢他接到投诉后所表现出来的那种严肃认真的态度，喜欢他的庄重，喜欢他愿意为她服务的热情，喜欢他作为旅馆老板尽心尽职的样子，还喜欢他那张沧桑、凝重的脸以及那双大手。

就是抱着这种心情，她推开了大门，向外望去。雨势比刚才又大了些。只见一个男子身穿橡胶雨衣，经过空旷的广场向咖啡馆走去。那只猫一定在右边的哪个地方。也许，她可以从房檐下走过去。正当她在门洞里盘算时，身后有人为她撑开了一把伞。原来是打扫房间的女服务员。

“可别让雨淋湿了。”服务员嫣然一笑，用意大利语说道。没说的，一定是旅馆老板派她来的。

由女服务员为她撑着伞，她沿着砾石路走去，一直走到他们那个房间的窗户根下。桌子摆在那儿，绿颜色被雨冲洗得鲜亮鲜亮，但桌下的猫已不见了踪影。这叫她大失所望。女服务员抬头看了她一眼。

“你丢东西了吗，夫人？(3)”

“这儿原来是有一只猫的。”年轻的美国太太说。

“一只猫？”

“是的，是有一只猫的。(4)”

“一只猫？”女服务员哈哈笑了起来，“下雨天这里会有一只猫？”

“是的。”美国太太说，“就在这桌子底下。”接着她又说道，“啊，我太想得到它了。我想要只小猫咪。”

她时而说意大利语，时而说英语，说英语时，女服务员脸上的表情不由有些紧张。

“走吧，夫人，”女服务员说，“还是进屋里去吧，会淋湿的。”

“看来只好这样了。”年轻的美国太太说。

两人沿着砾石路返回，走进了旅馆的大门。女服务员在门外停了停，将雨伞收拢。年轻的美国太太路过办公室时，旅馆老板从桌旁站起，又冲她欠了欠身子。她心里很纠结，有一种龌龊的感觉。老板既让她觉得自己乏味得不得了，又叫她感到自身相当了不起。一时间，她产生了一种情绪，觉得自己是个极为了不起的人物。待她上了楼，打开房间的门，见乔治正躺在床上看书。

“抓到那只猫了吗？”他放下手里的书问。

“不见啦。”

“会跑到哪里去了呢？”他说道。他看书看累了，趁此休息着眼睛。

她一屁股坐在了床上。

“我太想要那只猫了。”她说道，“我也不知道为什么，反正我非常想要。我想得到那只可怜的小猫咪。叫一只小猫咪在外边淋雨，可不是什么好玩的事。”

乔治又继续看他的书了。

她走过去，走到梳妆台的镜子前，借助手镜打量起镜中的自己。她观看自己的侧影，看看这边又看看那边，然后又端详自己的后脑勺以及脖子。

“我把头发留起来，你看这想法是不是很好呢？”她问道，一边又观赏起自己的侧影来。

乔治抬头看了看，见她脖后的头发很短，像男孩的头发一样短。

“这种样子我挺喜欢的。”

“这发式我都烦了。”她说，“老看上去像个男孩子，让人都烦了。”

乔治在床上换了个姿势。妻子开口说话时，他的眼睛就一直没有离开过她。

“你这样子看上去是非常漂亮的呀。”他说。

她将手镜放到梳妆台上，然后走到窗前向外张望。外边的天色正在变黑。

“我想留头发，梳拢，光光滑滑的，在后面打一个大发髻，可以时时摸一摸。”她说，“我想有只小猫咪，让它卧在我的膝上，一摸它就喵喵地叫。”

“是吗？”乔治在床上说。

“我想吃饭时用自己的银质餐具，点上蜡烛。我想现在就是春天……我想坐在镜子前梳头发……我想要只小猫咪……我想有几件新衣服。”

“好啦，别说了，你还是找本书看看吧。”乔治说完，又埋头看书了。

他的妻子将目光投向窗外。天已经黑透了，仍在下雨，雨水落在棕榈树上。

“不管怎样，我就是想要只猫。”她说，“我就是想要只猫，现在就想要。既然不能留长发，又没有什么好玩的，要只猫总是可以的吧。”

乔治没理会她，仍在看自己的书。他的妻子朝窗外望着，见广场上亮起了灯。

这时，响起了敲门声。

“请进。(5)”乔治说，同时把眼睛从书上抬了起来。

那个女服务员出现在了门道里，怀里抱着一只三色大猫。那只猫被她抱得紧贴在身上，在她的怀里挣扎着。

“打搅了，”她说道，“这是老板让抱来的，是送给夫人的。”

“双心”大河

（第一部）


火车继续朝前开，绕过一座被焚烧过的山丘，从视野里消失了。尼克一屁股坐在了帆布包和铺盖卷上——这些东西是行李员从行李车厢的门内扔出来的。此处没有村镇，什么都没有，只有铁轨和被火烧焦了的土地。锡尼小镇唯一的一条街道上原有十三家酒馆，如今全都不见了踪影。广厦旅馆只剩下了房基，兀立在地面上，基石都被大火烧得崩裂开了。这是锡尼小镇的仅存之物了。甚至连地表层都化成了焦土。

尼克望了望被大火烧秃了的山坡——他原指望可以在那儿看到散落着一些小镇居民的屋舍呢。随后，他抬腿沿着铁路向大河上的那座桥走去。大河依旧，河水在桥下原木的木桩跟前形成了漩涡。尼克低头看了看清澈的褐色河水（由于河床上的鹅卵石是褐色，河水看上去也就成了褐色）。他观望着激流中的鳟鱼，见它们抖动鱼鳍，竭力保持身体的稳定。只见有些鱼猛地换个角度，变动一下位置，就又在湍急的水流中稳定了下来。尼克就这么观望了许久。

他望着鱼儿把鼻子探入激流中，有许多鱼在快速流动的深水里显得有点变形，那是因为他是从凸透镜一般的水面一直朝下看的，而表层的流水与桥下原木木桩的阻力相抵，形成了平缓的涟漪。水潭的底部藏着大鱼，尼克起初没有看到，那是后来才发现的。那些大鱼紧贴砾石河底，隐身于迷宫一样的石头缝里以及激流荡起的沙雾中。

尼克站在桥上，低头望着水潭。这是个炎热的日子。一只翠鸟朝着河的上游飞去。尼克已经有很长时间没有这么望着河水欣赏鳟鱼了。看见那些鱼儿，他心里感到挺舒服的。当翠鸟的映影向上游移动时，一条大鳟鱼逆流而上，朝前一蹿，形成了一道长长的弧度——不过，这只是它的影子在水里构成的弧度，待它跃出水面，被阳光一照，影子也就消失了。随后，它又落回水里，沉入河面之下，顺着河水朝下游漂去，它的影子似乎紧随着它，一路畅行无阻。最后，它回到桥下原来的位置，面朝激流将身子绷紧。

随着那条鳟鱼的一举一动，尼克的心缩成了一团。早年的那种感觉又回来了。

他回转身，举目向下游望去。但见河水向前伸展，看得见鹅卵石的河底和浅滩，看得见一块块的巨石以及一个深水潭——那深水潭是河水流经绝壁脚下的一个拐弯处形成的。

尼克踏着枕木返回放行李的地方——他的行李放在铁轨旁的煤渣路上。他感到很开心。他把行李包的绑绳扯紧，调整了一下背带，然后一抡将行李包放在了背上，再把胳膊塞进背带圈里，前额抵在宽宽的行李带上，以分担肩膀上的一部分扯力。尽管如此，仍感到行李包死沉，简直沉得要命。他把皮质的钓竿匣子提在手中，身子前倾，让行李包的重量压在肩上，随后冒着酷暑，沿着与铁轨平行的那条路走去，将化为灰烬的小镇抛在了身后。绕过一座夹在两座火焚过的高山之间的小山丘，他拐上了一条大路，向乡野间走去。走着走着，他感觉到沉重的行李包勒得他肉疼。这条路顺着山势蜿蜒而上。爬山可不是件容易的事。他肌肉发痛，天气又热，但他心里是快活的。他觉得自己把一切都抛在了身后，再不需要思考，再不需要写作，什么都不需要做了。所有的一切都被他抛在了身后。

自从他下了火车，行李员把他的包囊从敞开的车厢门里扔出来，他发现一切都发生了翻天覆地的变化。锡尼小镇化为了一片焦土。周围的景物也遭到了焚毁，已面目全非。不过，这没什么大不了的，不可能让所有的一切都葬身于火海，对于这一点他笃信无疑。他行走在路上，在阳光下大汗淋漓，盘山而上，准备翻越横亘在铁路和松林覆盖的平原之间的那道山脉。

道路向前延伸，偶尔有段下坡路，除此之外一路爬山。他走啊走的。道路与火焚过的山坡平行，最后抵达山巅。他靠在一截树桩上歇气，将肩膀从背带圈里抽出来。极目远眺，前方就是那个松林覆盖的平原。火焚过的焦土到了左边山脉跟前便戛然而止。只见平原上遍布黑乎乎的松林，那松林一片一片，像一座座小岛。左边的远方，就是那条大河了。他眺望了一眼，但见河水翻波，在阳光下闪闪发亮。

他的面前别无他物，只有那松林覆盖的平原。再往远处看，才能看得到几座青山，那是苏必利尔湖(1)的标记，标志着该湖所处位置的高度。平原上热浪翻滚，那些青山显得遥远、朦胧，几乎难以看得见。如果他定睛使劲看，反而看不见。可是，他如果随便一望，就看得见远处高地的群山了。

他坐下来，背靠烧焦了的树桩，点了根烟抽。他的行李包平放在树桩的顶部，背带呈预备状态，随时都可以背上走，包上有一个被他的脊背顶出的凹痕。他一边抽烟，一边望着前方的原野。不用掏出地图查看，根据河流所处的位置，他也知道自己身在何处。

抽烟时，他的两条腿向前伸展。他注意到有只蚱蜢从地面爬过来，爬到了他的羊毛袜子上。这只蚱蜢是黑颜色的。刚才他走在路上，翻山越岭，把土里的许多蚱蜢都惊动了。它们都是黑颜色的，不过跟那种黑翅板的大蚱蜢不一样——那些大蚱蜢起飞时，翅板上会闪出黑黄色或黑红色的翅膀。而这些都是普普通通的蚱蜢，清一色的烟黑色。刚才在路上看见它们，倒是有几分好奇，却没有认真地把它们往心里放。现在，看着这只黑蚱蜢张开分成四片唇的嘴在啃他袜子上的毛线，他意识到这些蚱蜢是因为长期生活在烧焦的土地上才变成了黑色。他心想大火一定是前一年烧起来的，而今蚱蜢们全成了黑色。真不知道它们的黑颜色会保持多长时间。

他小心翼翼地伸出手，抓住蚱蜢的翅膀，把它翻过来，任它的几条腿在空中乱踢腾，仔细观察了一下它那多节的肚皮。不错，它的肚皮也是黑色的，是变了颜色的，而它的脊背和头是浅灰色的。

“飞吧，蚱蜢，”他第一次出声地说了话，“飞到别处去吧。”

他将蚱蜢抛向空中，看着它飞走，落在了道路对面的一根烧焦了的树桩上。

他立起身，将脊背靠在此时竖放在树桩顶的背包上，把胳膊伸进背带圈里。身挎背囊，他站在山脊上放眼望去，让目光越过原野飘向远处的大河，然后离开大路走下山坡。脚下的坡地很好走。下坡有两百码，到了着火线截止的地方。接下来要穿过齐脚踝深的香蕨木和一簇一簇的短叶松。有好长一段路都是陡峭的原野，一高一低的，脚下全是沙土，大自然又呈现出生机勃勃的景象。

他靠太阳确定方向，知道自己要到大河的哪个地方去。他一路前行，穿过松林覆盖的平原，爬上一个小土包，前边还会看到其他的小土包。时而他会站在一个土包上瞭望，只见左右全是松林，一片一片的，像是一座座大海岛。他折下几枝样子像石楠一般的香蕨木，插在背带之下。香蕨木被背带磨碎，他一边走一边闻着香蕨木散发出的芳香。

走在高低不平、没有树荫的平原上，他感到又累又热。他知道只要向左边一拐，随时都可以抵达河畔。大不了有一英里的路吧。可是他继续朝北走，尽量向河的上游走，预计得走一天的路。

穿过起伏的高地，有段时间，他可以看见前边耸立着一大片松林。于是他下了坡，然后慢慢地爬上坡走到桥头，在那儿转身向那片松林走去。

那片松林里没有灌木丛，树干直插青天，有些则相依相偎。所有的树干都长得笔直，呈棕褐色，没有枝杈。枝杈都长在靠上的树身上，有些交叉在一起，在棕褐色的地上投下浓浓的阴影。林子的旁边是一片空地，也是棕褐色的，走在上面又松又软。这是一片松针铺就的地，超出了高处枝杈投影的范围。树长高之后，枝杈上移，把它们原来用树荫遮盖的空地交给了阳光照耀。这片林地延伸区域的边沿与香蕨木地段紧紧相连。

他放下背包，躺倒在树荫里休息。他仰面朝天，目光射向松树的枝杈，伸展腰肢，让脖子、脊背和后腰得到休息。脊背挨着土地，感觉很惬意。他仰望天空，让目光穿过枝杈，随后闭上了眼睛。接下来，他又睁开眼，又仰望天空。高处的枝杈间有风在吹动。后来，他又闭上了眼睛，这次睡着了。

一觉睡醒，他浑身僵硬，有抽筋的感觉。太阳已快衔山。背上背包，他觉得那包沉甸甸的，带子勒在身上发痛。就这么背着背包，他拎起皮质钓竿匣，离开松林，穿过长满香蕨木的洼地，向河边走去。他知道，到那儿的路程不会超过一英里。

下了遍布树桩的山坡，来到了一片草地上。一直走到草地边，就是潺潺流淌的河水了。到了河边，他感到很开心。随后，他踏着草地向上游走去。走着走着，他的裤脚被露水打得湿漉漉的。炎热的白天一过，就降了天露，露水很重。河流没有声响，因为河水流得太快、太平稳了。走到草地的尽头，他打算登上一块高地扎营。但在去那儿之前，他朝河水里望了一眼，观察正在浮向水面的鳟鱼。鳟鱼之所以浮上来，是要捕食太阳落山时分从河对面沼泽地飞过来的昆虫。鳟鱼会跃出水面进行捕猎。他走过河边那一小段草地时，就已经见有鳟鱼跃出水面了。此刻望着河水，他觉得昆虫一定是栖息在水面上，因为河面上到处都有鳟鱼在不间断地捕食。极目远眺，只见长长的一段河水里，鳟鱼纷纷浮到水面，在水面荡起一圈一圈的水纹，像是天开始落雨了。

来到高处，这儿有树木，脚下是沙地，可以俯瞰草地、河流以及沼泽地。他放下背包以及钓竿匣，想寻找一块平坦的地方。他饥肠辘辘，打算先扎营，然后做饭吃。在两棵短叶松之间，有一块地倒是挺平坦。他从包里取出斧头，将伸出地面的两个树根砍断。这片平地还算宽敞，够睡觉的。他用手把地面的沙土抚平，将碍事的香蕨木全都连根拔起。这一来，他的手有一种香蕨木的馨香。然后，他把翻起的泥土弄平。他可不愿毯子下有任何疙疙瘩瘩的东西。泥土平整完之后，他将三条毛毯铺在地上，一条对折，紧挨地面，另两条覆盖在这一条的上边。

随后，他抡起斧头，从松树桩上砍下一片闪着亮光的木头，把它劈开，做成若干个木钉用来固定帐篷。他想要的是长长的结实的木钉，好把帐篷固定在地上。从包里取出帐篷，摊在地上，这一来，斜靠在短叶松上的背包就显得小多了。他捡起一根用作帐篷横梁的绳子，将一头绑在一棵松树的树干上，拉起另一头，把帐篷从地上拖起，再将这一头系在另一棵松树之上。帐篷悬在绳子上，就像帆布片挂在晾衣绳上一样。他把砍削好的一根杆子撑在这块大帆布后边的顶部，再砸入木钉固定四周，使之成了一顶帐篷。固定四周时，他把木钉砸得很深，用斧头的平面将它们砸进地里，连绳圈都跟着进了土里，将帆布绷得跟鼓面一般紧。

在帐篷的开口处，他挂了一块布阻挡蚊子。接着，他从背包里取出几样东西，从挡蚊子的门帘下爬进帐篷，将东西放在床头（小床置于帆布帐篷倾斜面之下）。天光透过棕色的帆布射了进来。帆布散发出好闻的气味。这儿的气氛有点神秘，却给人以家一样的感觉。钻进帐篷里来，他心情愉悦。这并不是说这一整天他的心情一直不好，只是感觉有所不同罢了。现在，愿望已经实现。这个愿望由来已久，而今一朝实现。旅途劳累，累得他浑身都散了架。愿望实现了，他扎好了营，安顿了下来，什么都不怕了。这是个安营扎寨的好地方，而他现在就在这好地方扎下了营。他给自己建了个家，他就在自己的家里。这工夫，他肚子饿了。

他从门帘下爬出了帐篷。外边已黑透了，帐篷里反而亮一些。

他走到背包跟前，用手在背包里摸索着，在背包底部装钉子的纸袋里找到一枚长钉。他紧紧捏住这枚钉子，用斧头的平面轻轻地敲打，将其砸入松树的树干，然后把背包挂在钉子上。所有的用品都装在背包里，这下子离开了地面，不用担心了。

他肚子饿了，觉得以前从来都没有这么饿过。他打开一听猪肉黄豆罐头和一听意大利面条，一股脑倒进煎锅。

“既然愿意把这些东西大老远拿来，就有权利把它们解决掉。”他自言自语地说。在越来越黑的林子里，他的声音听上去怪怪的。于是，他也就不再说了。

他用斧头从一个松树树桩上砍下几块木头，生了堆火，将一个网状的烤架架在火上，然后用靴子把烤架的四条腿踩进土里。接下来，他把煎锅放在了烤架上，底下是熊熊燃烧的火焰。此时，他肚子更饿了。黄豆和面条加热了。他搅了搅锅，把黄豆和面条掺和在一起。食物开始冒气泡，一些小气泡从底部艰难地翻上来，喷喷香。他取出一瓶番茄酱，切了四片面包。小气泡冒得更快了。他在火边坐下，将煎锅端下来，把锅里的东西倒了大概有一半在白铁盘子上。黄豆面慢慢在盘子上摊开了。他知道现在吃还太烫，于是浇了一些番茄酱在上面。黄豆和面条仍然烫得难以入口。他望望火堆，再看看帐篷。他可不愿把舌头烫伤，坏了兴致。多年来，他一直都不喜欢吃煎香蕉，因为他耐不住性子，无法等到煎香蕉凉下来再入口。他的舌头极其敏感。这当儿，他都快饿死了。河对岸的沼泽地黑魆魆的，他瞧见有一团雾在冉冉升起。他把目光收回来，又看了看帐篷。这下可以进餐了。他从盘子上舀了满满一勺面吃了下去。

“基督呀，”他说道，“我的基督呀。”他快活得不得了。

把一盘面都吃完，他才想起还有面包呢。吃第二盘时，他一边吃面一边吃面包，吃完了还用面包把盘子擦得锃亮。在圣伊格纳斯时，他曾在车站饭馆喝过一杯咖啡，吃过一块火腿三明治。打那以后，他再也没进过食。这倒是一段非常好的经历。以前他也有过饿肚子的经历，但都觉得不够味。按说，只要愿意，几小时前就可以扎营了。河边适合于扎营的地方有的是。不过，还是现在的这个营地好。

他把两大块松木塞进了烤架下的火里。火苗一下子蹿了上来。刚才，他都忘了取水冲咖啡了。于是，他从背包里拿出一个折叠式帆布桶，下了山坡，穿过草地的边缘，向河边走去。河对岸白雾茫茫。他跪在岸边，将帆布桶放进水里，感觉到膝下的草儿湿漉漉、冷冰冰。帆布桶鼓了起来，被水流用劲地拖着。河里的水冰冷刺骨。他把桶洗了洗，盛满水，提着回营地里去。离开了河边，也就感到不那么冷了。

他在树干上又砸进去一枚大钉子，将盛满水的桶挂在了上面。他给咖啡壶里灌了半壶水，又往烤架下的火里塞了几块木柴，然后把咖啡壶放在烤架上。他记不得自己平时都是怎么煮咖啡的，只记得跟霍普金斯为此斗过嘴，却忘了自己持什么样的观点。他决定先把水煮沸再说。此时他想起这是霍普金斯的煮法。曾经有一度，他和霍普金斯不管什么事都争论不休。在等着咖啡煮沸的当儿，他打开了一小听杏子罐头。他很喜欢开罐头的那种感觉。他将罐头里的杏子全倒进了一只白铁杯子里。一边观察着火上的咖啡，一边喝着杏子罐头的甜汁，起初小心翼翼的，生怕甜汁洒出来，后来想着心事，三口两口把杏子吞下了肚。罐头杏子比鲜杏味道好。

看着看着，咖啡就煮沸了。壶盖被顶起来，咖啡和咖啡沫溢出来，顺着壶帮朝下淌。他急忙把咖啡壶从烤架上拿开。这是霍普金斯煮法的胜利。他把糖放进刚才盛杏子的空杯子里，倒了些咖啡进去放凉。咖啡太烫，不好倒，他就用帽子垫在咖啡壶的柄上。用帽子垫柄，是因为他不愿意让帽子浸在壶里。可不能喝第一杯咖啡就把帽子弄脏。应该完全沿用霍普金斯煮咖啡的方法。霍普(2)理应得到这项荣誉。霍普是一个非常认真的咖啡爱好者，也是他所认识的一个最认真的人，并非庄重，而是认真。那是很久之前的陈年往事了。霍普金斯说话不见嘴唇动，喜欢打马球，曾在德克萨斯大发横财，赚了几百万块钱。当初他去芝加哥，还是借的盘缠，而就在这时电报来了，说他的第一口大油井出油了。他原来是可以发电报让汇钱来的，只是那样太慢，怕来不及。大家把霍普的女友叫金发维纳斯。霍普对此并不介意，因为那女孩并非他真正的女友。他坚定地说，对于他真正的女友，任何人都不许胡开玩笑。他这话说得一点不错。电报来时，霍普金斯已经走了。当时，那是在黑河的河畔。等到电报到了他手里，八天已经过去了。他把自己的.22口径的柯尔特牌自动手枪送给尼克，把照相机赠给了比尔，以此让大家对他老有个念想。他们准备第二年夏天再次去钓鱼。酒鬼霍普(3)成了有钱人。他将买一艘游艇，大伙儿一起去苏必利尔湖，沿着湖的北岸航行。他当时很激动，但说话却是认真的。道别时，大家的心情都不太好。后来，那趟旅行告吹了。他们再也没见过霍普金斯。那是很久以前发生在黑河河畔的事情。

尼克喝了咖啡，那是按霍普金斯的方法烹制的咖啡，味道比较苦。尼克不由得笑了。故事这样收尾是很好的。他的大脑很活跃，但他太累了，恐怕半截子会卡壳的。于是他把壶里剩下的咖啡倒掉，抖了抖咖啡壶，将里面的渣子抖进火里。然后，他点起一支烟，走进帐篷，脱掉鞋和裤子，坐在毯子上。接着，他把鞋卷在裤子里当枕头，一出溜钻进了两条毯子之间。

透过帐篷的前侧，他望着闪烁的火光——夜风在朝火里灌。夜非常安静，沼泽地那儿万籁俱寂。他在毯子下舒服地伸了个懒腰。一只蚊子在他的耳边嗡嗡叫了几声。他坐起来，划亮一根火柴，见蚊子落在了头顶的帐篷上，于是赶快过去用火柴烧它。蚊子嘶的一声葬身于火海，让他感到很满意。火柴熄灭了。他又盖着毯子躺了下来，翻个身，合上眼睛。他昏昏欲睡，觉得睡意袭来，将身子在毯子下蜷了蜷，进入了梦乡。

“双心”大河

（第二部）


次日早晨，太阳升起，帐篷里开始热了起来。尼克从罩在帐篷入口处的挡蚊网下端爬出去，瞭望着清晨的景色。爬出帐篷时，两手触着草地，觉得那草湿漉漉的。他手里拎着裤子和鞋。太阳刚刚爬上山头。眼前是草地、河流以及沼泽。河对岸绿绿的沼泽地里长着一棵棵白桦树。

清晨的河水清澈，水流平稳、湍急。下游大约有二百码的地方架着三根原木，横贯在流水之上，让拦在后边的河水变得又平又深。就在他观看的当儿，一只水貂从原木上跑过河，钻进了沼泽地。他感到很兴奋。清晨的美景以及河水叫他心情激动。他心急火燎的，无意吃早饭，但他知道早饭是必须要吃的。于是他生起一小堆火，将咖啡壶架在上面。

水在壶里热着，他拿起一个空瓶子，从高地的边缘下去，向着草地走去。草地被露水打得湿漉漉的。他想在太阳把青草晒干之前抓几只蚱蜢当鱼饵。他找到了许许多多像样的蚱蜢。它们有的躲在草茎的根部，有的附在草茎上，一个个浑身冰冷，湿湿地沾着露水，要等到阳光温暖了身子才能够跳跃呢。他专挑中等个头的棕褐色蚱蜢，把它们捡起，放进瓶子里。他把一根原木翻起，见原木的边缘下藏着几百只蚱蜢。这儿是蚱蜢的寓所。他将大概有五十只中等个头的棕褐色蚱蜢塞进了瓶子。就在他挑选之际，其他的蚱蜢在阳光下暖和了过来，一只只开始跳走了。它们边跳边飞，一开始只飞一段路，然后就落下来，僵硬地待在那儿，仿佛死去了一般。

他知道，等他吃完早饭，蚱蜢们就会像平时一样活蹦乱跳了。如果草上没有露水，要抓一瓶像样的蚱蜢，得用一整天的时间。用帽子捕捉蚱蜢，非得压死许多不可。在河水里，他把手洗了洗。一接近河边，他就有一种兴奋的感觉。随后，他向帐篷走去。草地上的蚱蜢已在僵硬地蹦跳了。瓶子里的蚱蜢被阳光照暖了身子，炸了窝似的胡蹦乱跳。他取过一截松枝当瓶塞塞在了瓶口，刚好把瓶口堵住，让蚱蜢出不来，同时叫空气充分流通。

他把翻起的原木放回原处，情知每天早晨都可以来这儿抓蚱蜢。

然后，他将盛满活蹦乱跳蚱蜢的瓶子靠在一棵松树的树干上，快手快脚地用水和了些荞麦粉，一杯面粉一杯水，搅和匀。他抓起一把咖啡放进咖啡壶里，从罐头里舀出一勺牛油平摊在烧热了的煎锅上。接下来，他把荞麦面糊均匀地倒在冒着烟的煎锅上，弄得面糊像岩浆一样四散开，牛油嗞嗞啦啦地发出声响。荞麦饼的四周开始变硬、发黄，最后变得脆脆的。饼的表层出现了气泡，气泡又慢慢变成了气孔。他拿起一片刚砍下来的松木当铲子，伸到煎黄了的那一面底下，把煎锅左右晃了晃，让面饼脱离了锅面。“我可不愿甩动煎锅做飞饼！”他心想。于是，他把那片干净的松木铲入饼下，一直伸到头，将面饼整个翻了过来。面饼在煎锅上嗞嗞啦啦响了一阵。

饼子做好之后，他又在煎锅上涂了些牛油，把所有的面糊用完，又做了一个大煎饼和一个小一些的煎饼。

他涂上苹果酱，把一大一小两个煎饼风卷残云般吃下了肚。然后，他给另一个煎饼也涂了苹果酱，对折了两下，用油纸包好，放进了衬衣口袋里。接着，他把那瓶苹果酱放回背包里，将面包切开，够做两个三明治用的。

他在背包里找出一大头洋葱，用刀子一劈两半，剥掉光滑的外皮，将其中的一半切成片，做成了两个洋葱三明治。然后，他把三明治包在油纸里，放入卡其衬衫的另一个口袋，再将口袋的纽扣扣好。他把烤架上的煎锅翻了个过，喝光了咖啡（咖啡里加了炼乳，味道发甜，颜色变成了黄褐色）。接下来，他清理营地，准备行囊。这是一个很不错的营地。

他从皮质钓竿匣里取出飞蝇钓竿，一节节连在一起，然后将钓竿匣塞回帐篷里。接着，他装上卷轴，用导线将钓线布好。布钓线时，他左右开弓，用两手轮流抓紧钓线，否则钓线会由于自身的重量滑回去。这种钓线沉甸甸的，是双股的飞钓线，是很久以前他花了八块钱买的。这种钓线沉，是为了便于朝后往空中甩，往前落下来时能够做到平稳、沉重、笔直，将毫无重量的做钓饵的苍蝇甩进水里。他打开铝质的导绳匣子——那些导绳盘在一起，放在潮湿的法兰绒衬垫之间。在开往圣伊格纳斯的火车上，他用水冷器里的水浇湿了衬垫。羊肠导绳裹在潮湿的衬垫间就变软了。此时，他展开一截导绳，用一个环把导绳的一端连在沉甸甸的飞钓线上，再将一个钓钩固定在导绳的另一端。这是一种小钓钩，很细，富有弹性。

从钓钩匣里取钓钩时，他坐在那儿，将钓竿横放在膝上。他把钓线扯紧，看钓钩系得牢不牢以及钓竿的弹性怎么样。感觉很好。他一举一动都很小心，不让钓钩扎着手指。

他拔腿向河边走去，拎着钓竿，脖子上吊着那瓶蚱蜢——他先用一根皮条套在瓶颈上，打个活扣，然后吊在脖子上。袋网挂在腰带的一个钩上，一条长长的面粉袋搭在肩上，每个角都挽一个结，拴面粉袋的绳子绕在肩上，走起路那面粉袋老是碰腿。

身上丁零当啷挂了这许多东西行路有些不便，但作为一个钓鱼人，他的心里却是快活的。装蚱蜢的瓶子在胸前荡来荡去；衬衣的上排口袋里装着他的午饭以及蝇饵盒，鼓鼓囊囊顶在他身上。

他一抬腿走进了河水里，浑身一激灵。裤腿紧紧贴在他的腿上。他感到鞋子踩在沙砾上。河水冰冷，使他连连打冷战。

水流湍急，冲击着他的腿。他下河的地方，河水没膝。他蹚水前行，沙砾在脚下一滑一滑的。他低头看看在两腿前打旋的水流，将瓶口倒过来，想取出一只蚱蜢。

最上面的一只蚱蜢从瓶口一跃，跳进了水里，被他右腿跟前的漩涡吸进激流，往下游漂了几步路又浮出了水面。它在水面上急速漂流，踢腾着腿。后来猛地出现一圈水纹，水纹划破了平平的水面，它就不见了踪影。一条鳟鱼吃掉了它。

又有一只蚱蜢把脑袋探出瓶口，抖动着触须。它的两条前腿伸出瓶子准备跳跃。尼克一把揪住它的头，抓牢它，用细钩穿透它的下巴，再经过它的胸腔，将钩子穿进它腹部的肠子肚子里。蚱蜢用前脚抓住钓钩，吐出烟油一样的汁液来。尼克一松手，将它丢进了水里。

他用右手握住钓竿，顺着蚱蜢在水里的拉力放出钓线。他用左手从卷轴上拿下钓线，由着它漂去。他可以看见蚱蜢在水里荡起一些小小的波纹，后来就不见了。

有东西扯了一下钓线。尼克急忙把绷紧的线往回拉。这可是他钓到的第一条鱼。他紧握在水上抖动的钓竿，左手往回收钓线。上钩的鳟鱼在激流中左冲右突，把钓竿扯得一弯一弯。他知道是条小鱼，一举钓竿，把钓竿直直举到空中，那钓竿被鱼儿拉得弯了腰。

他看见鳟鱼的头和身子剧烈摆动，以抵消钓线在水里紧一下松一下的拉力。

他用左手抓住钓线，将那条在水流中有气无力扑腾的鳟鱼拉到水面上来。鳟鱼的后背色彩斑驳，跟清澈的河水下沙砾的颜色一样，腰部在阳光下闪着亮光。他把钓竿夹在右腋下，弯下身子，将右手伸进水里，用湿漉漉的右手抓住了一直扭动不已的鱼儿，取下它嘴上的倒钩，扑通一声将其扔回到了河水里。

鳟鱼摇摆不定地漂在水里，后来沉到了河底一块石头旁，他伸手去摸它，水一直浸到胳膊肘。鳟鱼在流淌的水里一动不动，待在一块石头旁的沙砾上。他用手指碰了碰它，觉得它在水下光滑、冰冷。这一碰，鳟鱼游走了，从河底游到了一片阴影里。

他觉得鳟鱼并无大碍，只是太累罢了。刚才摸鱼之前，他先弄湿了手，如此便不至于蹭掉鱼身上那一层薄薄的黏液了。要是用干手摸，鱼身上那一块没有了黏液保护的地方就会被一种白色的霉菌感染。几年前，他到河边钓鱼，那儿身前身后挤满了用飞钩钓鱼的人。他时不时会看见死鱼，身上毛茸茸长满了白色的霉菌，有的漂到岩石跟前，有的翻白肚浮在水潭里。除非跟与自己合得来的人，他不愿和其他人在河边垂钓，因为那会破坏兴致的。

他蹚水向下游走，河水淹过了膝盖，在河上搭的那几根原木前的浅水里走了有五十码远。他没有给钓钩重新下饵，蹚水时把钓钩拿在手中。在浅水里是能够抓到小鳟鱼的，对此他很有把握，但他并不想要小鳟鱼，而一天的这个时候，浅水里却见不到大鳟鱼。

走着走着，河水突然加深，深及大腿根，冰冷刺骨。前面便是被原木拦住的水面，平平展展的。那一片河水平坦，黑黢黢的；左边是青草坡地靠近河岸的边缘，右边则是沼泽地。

他顶着流水身子后仰，从瓶子里取出一只蚱蜢，将蚱蜢穿在钓钩上，在它身上吐了一口唾沫，以求好运降临。随后，他从卷轴上扯下几码长的钓线，扬手将蚱蜢抛到了前方湍急、黑黢黢的水面上。蚱蜢向原木那儿漂去，接着，重重的钓线把这鱼饵拖到了水下。他紧握钓竿，从指头缝里放出钓线。

钓线被水流拖出了很长一截子。他猛一拉，钓竿摇晃了几下，随后出现了险情，竿身弯成了九十度，钓线绷紧，跃出了水面，被扯得紧紧的，沉沉地、持续地扯，相当危险。假如拉力不断加大，导线势必会绷断。他觉得已到了危急关头，于是松开了钓线。

钓线急速蹿了出去，卷轴上的棘轮嘎吱嘎吱尖叫个不停。简直太快了。他都无法控制得了了。钓线急速蹿出，卷轴的叫声也随着钓线的蹿出越来越高。

卷轴的轴心露出来时，他感觉到紧张得心脏都快要停跳了，水更深了，冰冷地刺着他的腿根，身子朝后仰，用左手的拇指使劲按住卷轴。把拇指伸进飞钩卷轴的框子里，真不是个滋味。

他用力一扯，钓线猛然绷紧，绷得硬邦邦的，随后见原木那边有一条大鳟鱼高高地跃出了水面。它跃到空中时，他垂下了钓竿尖。就在他放低钓竿尖以减轻拉力时，他觉得刚才鳟鱼的拉力太大了，钓线绷得太紧了。导线很显然已经被扯断了。当钓线完全失去了弹性，变得干涩、硬邦邦的，这种感觉是错不了的。钓竿尖低垂，钓线松了一些。

他嘴发干，心下沉，开始用卷轴收线。他从未见过这么大的鳟鱼。那重量，那难以遏制的力量，还有跃起来时那庞大的身躯！它看上去简直跟鲑鱼一样宽。

他手发抖，慢慢地收线。刚才的刺激简直太大了。他隐约觉得有点恶心，觉得还是坐下来歇歇好。

导线被扯断了，断在系着钓钩的地方。他把断了的导线拿在手里，心想那条鳟鱼一定嘴里穿着钓钩躲在原木下，远离水面，在流水中稳住身子，藏在河底的沙砾上。他知道鳟鱼的牙齿最终一定会咬断钓钩的钩线的，而把钓钩留在腮帮子上。他敢说那条鳟鱼一定气坏了。那么大的个头，怎么说都会生气的。那可是条大鳟鱼呀！它被钓钩钩得死死的，固定在那儿像块石头。它不游不动，拉钓线也觉得它像块石头。上帝啊，这可真真切切是条大个子鳟鱼呀！上帝啊，这条鳟鱼的个头之大，他前所未闻过。

他爬上岸，站到草地上，裤子上的水和鞋里的水朝下直淌，一动鞋子就嘎吱嘎吱地响。他走过去，坐在那几根原木上。他可不想加剧心里的激动情绪。

他把脚丫子在鞋里的水中扭动了几下，从前胸口袋里掏出一根烟点着，然后将火柴扔进原木下急速流淌的河水里。火柴在激流中打着旋，一条小鳟鱼浮上水面咬它。他见了哈哈一笑。他要在此处把烟抽完，欣赏眼前的情景。

坐在原木上吞云吐雾，晒着太阳，脊背叫阳光晒得暖暖的，望着前边浅浅的河水流进树林，蜿蜒曲折，闪着亮光，河床上点缀着一块块被水冲得很光滑的巨石，岸上有香柏和白桦树，屁股下的原木被太阳晒得发暖，没有树皮，摸着很舒服，坐上去光溜溜的，心里原有的失望感就慢慢消失了。这种失望感来得快，是在他肩膀疼的时候突然出现的，消失的时候却慢如抽丝。现在这些都过去了。钓竿放在原木上，他给导线上又拴了个新钓钩，将羊肠线抽紧，使之形成一个硬结。

他穿好鱼饵，然后拿起钓竿走到原木的另一端，打算从那儿下水，因为那儿的水不太深。原木下的另一侧是一个深水潭。他绕过沼泽地跟前的浅滩，一直走到浅水处的河床上。

左首，草地的尽头是林边，那儿躺着一株被连根拔起的大榆树。它是在一场暴风雨中倒下去的，树身倒向了林中，而根部连带着泥块，上面长着小草，横在河边，构成了一段坚实的河岸。河水冲刷着这棵被连根拔起的大树的边缘。他从自己所站的地方可以看到浅水河床上有一道道的深槽，那是水流冲出来的，像车辙一样。他所在之处是鹅卵石河床，远处则密密麻麻净是大石块，夹杂着鹅卵石。河水在树根附近转了个弯，此处的河床呈泥灰色，深水下的槽与槽之间长着绿色的水草，在激流中左摆右晃的。

他把钓竿从肩膀头朝后一抡，再向前一甩，钓线前弯，将蚱蜢鱼饵送到了水草间的一个深槽里。一条鳟鱼咬住了蚱蜢，被他钩住了。

他握紧钓竿，将钓竿伸向那棵被连根拔起的树，在激流中连连后退，弄得水花四溅。鳟鱼左跳右跳，让拉弯了的钓竿激烈晃动着。他急忙扯钓竿，将鳟鱼从水草间安全地拉到了开阔的水域。钓竿迎着激流剧烈地晃动，而他抓紧钓竿，把鳟鱼往怀里拉。鳟鱼挣扎着想跑，但每一次都被拉了回来，具有弹性的钓竿一弯一直的。钓钩有时被扯到水下，却总是会把鳟鱼再拉回来。他一边收线，一边向下游走，最后将钓竿举过头顶，把鳟鱼吊到网兜上方，再张开网接住。

鳟鱼沉甸甸挂在网兜里，网眼里露出它那斑驳的脊背和银白色的腹部。他解下了钓钩。鳟鱼的腹部很厚实，大大的下颌突出，容易抓得牢。他一松手，让一口一口喘息着的鳟鱼滑落进了搭在他肩上的长形布袋里，那布袋从他的肩头一直垂到水里。

他迎着激流张开布袋口，灌满水，把布袋灌得沉甸甸的，然后一提，底部仍留在水中，布袋里的水从旁边倾泻而出。这样，布袋底部的鳟鱼浸在水里，仍可以存活。

他朝下游移动，挂在前胸的布袋浸在水里发沉，拉扯着他的肩膀。

天气越来越热，阳光照得他的脖颈发烫。

他已经钓到了一条挺不错的鳟鱼。至于能不能钓到多条鳟鱼，他并不在乎。此处的河段又浅又宽，两岸树影婆娑。左岸的树木于午前的阳光下在水面遮出了一道一道短短的阴影。他知道每一道阴影里都藏有鳟鱼。午后，阳光移向群山，鳟鱼就到对岸去，躲在对岸凉爽的阴影里。

那些超级大的鳟鱼一般会躲在靠近河岸的地方。在黑河钓鱼的时候，这种大鳟鱼一抓一个准。太阳一落山，鳟鱼们会倾巢而出，游到激流中来。太阳下山之前，水面上波光闪耀，刺人眼目，此时在激流里任何一个地方都可以抓到大鳟鱼。只是抓不成而已，因为水面在阳光下亮得刺眼，像一面镜子。当然，你可以到上游去抓喽。不过，不管是在黑河还是这样的河蹚水往上游走，你得顶着激流逆行，踏进深水区，河水会把你淹没的。在这种湍急的激流中到上游去钓鱼，可不是闹着玩的。

他一边走过浅水滩，一边眼睛盯着河岸边，看那儿有没有深水潭。紧靠河水长着一棵山毛榉，枝叶垂下来，浸到了水中。河水在枝叶下产生了回流。这种地方总是会有鳟鱼的。

他不愿到那潭水里钓鱼，因为他情知钓钩一定会缠在树枝上的。

不过，那儿的水看上去倒是挺深的。他投下蚱蜢，水流把它吸到了水底，随后又将它送到了低垂的树枝下。钓线绷紧了，他往回一拉，上钩的鳟鱼用力地扑腾着，在枝叶之间露出水面半个身子来。钓线被缠住了。他用力一拉，鳟鱼脱钩了。他用卷轴收回钓线，将钓钩拿在手中，向下游走去。

前边靠近左岸有一根大大的原木，看得出是空心的，朝着上游横放在那里，河水缓缓地流进去，仅在原木的两侧激起一圈小小的涟漪。越往前走，河水就越深。空心原木的顶部呈灰颜色，是干燥的，有一部分隐没在阴影里。

他把蚱蜢瓶的瓶塞拔出，有一只蚱蜢附在瓶塞上。他把它拿在手中，穿到钓钩上，然后甩了出去。他将钓竿伸得远远的，让蚱蜢从水上漂到那股钻进空心原木的水流里。接着，他把钓竿放低，于是蚱蜢便漂进了原木空心里。钓线被沉沉地拉紧了，他往回抽钓竿以抵抗那股拉力。他觉得就好像钓钩钩在了原木上一样，只是那上钩的东西是活的罢了。

他竭力想把鳟鱼拉出来，拉进外边的水流里。鳟鱼出来了，分量重重的。钓线一下子变松了，他以为鳟鱼溜掉了，可随后他看见了它，近在咫尺，在水里摆动着头，企图将钓钩甩掉。它的嘴被钩得死死的。它在清澈的流水里拼命挣扎，和钓钩殊死搏斗。

他用左手将钓线绕成圈，一圈一圈朝回拉。他抖抖钓竿，把钓线扯紧，想把鳟鱼向网兜跟前引，可是鳟鱼一出溜跑了，不见了踪影，钓线却在晃动着。他顶着激流跟它搏斗着，钓竿一弹一跳，而它随之扑腾个不停。他将钓竿转移到左手，然后把鳟鱼往上游一拉，提起钓竿，任它悬在钓竿上挣扎，最后将它丢进了网兜里。他拎起网兜，鳟鱼沉甸甸的，弯成了半圆形，而网兜不时朝下滴着水。他解下钓钩，把它丢进了布袋里。

他张开布袋口，低头看了看，见那两条大鳟鱼在水中扭动着。

他蹚过渐深的河水，向那根空心原木走去。随后，他绕过头顶将布袋取下。鳟鱼一离开水，就胡乱拍打起来。他找个地方将布袋挂起，让鳟鱼深深地浸在水中。然后，他爬上原木，坐下来，裤子上的水和靴子里的水哗哗朝下淌，汇入河水里。他放下钓竿，转移到原木有阴凉的另一端，从衣袋里掏出三明治，将三明治在冰冷的水里浸了浸。河水把一些面包屑冲走了。他吃了三明治，然后用帽子盛水喝，把帽壳里灌满了水，喝的时候，帽壳里的水直从嘴边朝外流。

坐在阴凉地的原木上倒是挺凉爽的。他取了根烟，划着火柴。火柴掉在灰色的木头上，烧出一个小凹痕。他向着原木的一侧歪了歪身子，找块坚实的地方，又划了根火柴，坐在那儿边抽烟边观望河景。

前方，河水变窄，弯进了沼泽地里，水面平缓，但很深。沼泽里长着香柏，看上去像陆地。香柏一棵挨一棵，枝杈密密麻麻。这样的沼泽地是不可能穿越的。树的枝杈长得太低，动弹起来恐怕得贴近地面才行。这样的枝杈是硬冲不过去的。他心想：难怪生活在这片沼泽地的动物都弯腰曲背的。

真希望当初带本书来就好了。这会儿，他觉得自己很想拿本书看看。他不愿再往前走到沼泽地里去了。朝河面上望了一眼，只见有棵巨大的香柏树横贯河面，搭在两岸之上。远处可见河水蜿蜒流进沼泽。

此刻他不想进沼泽地。去那儿得走深水区，水深可达腋窝处，在那种地方就是钓到大鱼，也无法弄上岸的，所以他有一种排斥心理。在沼泽里，岸上光秃秃的，巨大的香柏树抱成团遮在头顶，阳光洒不进来，只可见一些斑驳的光点。这样半明半暗的光线，在湍急的深水里钓鱼是会很惨的。到沼泽地里钓鱼是一种悲惨的冒险。他可不愿冒这种险。反正今天他是不愿再往下游走了。

他取出折刀，将折刀打开，一刀扎在原木上，然后拎起布袋，伸手进去拿出一条鳟鱼。他用手抓紧鳟鱼的尾巴根——那鳟鱼胡乱挣扎，很难抓得牢。随后，他把鳟鱼在原木上狠劲摔了一下。那鱼抖动了几下，最后僵硬了。他把这条鳟鱼放在原木上的阴凉处，又以同样的方式摔断了另一条鱼的脖子。他将两条鱼并排放在原木上。这可是两条相当棒的鳟鱼！

他把它们大开膛，从肛门剖至下颌，剔了个干净。所有的内脏、鱼鳃和舌头都一股脑儿剜了出来。两条鱼都是雄性，灰白色的输精管长长的，又平展又干净。鱼的内脏被干净利落地全取了出来，他将那些废弃了的东西扔到岸上供水貂觅食。

他把鳟鱼拿到河水里清洗。在河水里，他让鱼儿背朝上。两条鳟鱼看上去像活的一样，颜色都没有变。接着，他洗了洗手，把手在原木上蹭干。随后，他将鳟鱼放在摊在原木之上的布袋上，卷起来，扎了个捆，置入袋网里。他的折刀还扎在那儿，刀刃嵌入原木。他拔出折刀，在原木上蹭了蹭，放进了衣袋里。

他在原木上站起身，握紧钓竿，将沉甸甸的袋网挎在肩上，然后踏入水中，一路溅着水花向岸边走去。他爬上岸，钻进林子，朝着高地进发，取道返回营地。回首望去，透过树木那条河流隐约可见。来日方长，他总有机会可以到沼泽地里钓鱼的。





暴风雨过后


那时不为了什么大不了的事情，不值得动拳头，可我们俩却厮打在了一起。我脚下一滑摔倒在地，他用膝盖顶住我的胸口，两手掐住我的脖子，掐得我透不过气，好像非得把我掐死不可。我试图从衣袋里掏出刀子捅他一刀，好让他松手。旁边的人都喝得酩酊大醉，没有人出手把他拉开。他掐住我，把我的头往地上碰。我终于将折刀掏了出来，打开，在他的胳膊上划了一刀，把他胳膊上的肌肉都划裂了，于是他一下子松了手。就是他想抓住我不放，也力所难及了。只见他就地一滚，用手捂紧受伤的胳膊，竟然呜呜哭了起来。我在一旁说：

“见鬼啦，你想掐死我吗？”

我恨不得一刀子捅死他算啦。他掐得我喉咙疼，害得我一星期咽不下饭去。

话说当时，我一拍屁股逃离了那儿。他们人多势众，当中有几个跑过来追我。我拐了个弯，从码头旁夺路而逃。路上遇到一个人，他说出人命了，街上有个人被杀了。我问：“是谁杀的？”他说：“不清楚是谁杀的，反正人已经死了。”此时天色已黑，街上到处是积水，没有路灯，住家户的窗户玻璃碎了一地，狂风把船刮到了街道上，树木被吹倒，所有的一切都被大风刮得面目全非。我弄到一只划子，划着它出了码头去寻找我的船。我把那只小船停泊在曼格礁石湾里了。它平安无事，只是船舱里灌满了水。于是我动手清理船舱，用水泵把水抽干净。天上有月亮，但乌云遮顶，风势依然猛烈。我将小船划开，天亮时分已离开了东港。

兄弟，那场暴风雨真够味。我的船是第一个出来的，从没见过浪头那么大。海浪汹涌，颜色白得就跟碱水一样，从东港滚滚向西南礁石湾冲来，使人连海岸都看不清了。劲风掠过海滩，在海滩上刮出一条大沟。树林倾伏，中间被风刮出一条通道，那儿满都是水，白得像粉笔，水上什么东西都有，树枝啦，整棵树啦，死鸟啦，全都漂浮在水面上。好像全世界的鹈鹕以及其他各种各样的飞鸟都躲进了礁石湾里。它们一定是提前知道暴风雨要来才藏身于此处的。

我在西南礁石湾待了一天，没见那伙人追过来。我的船是来这儿的第一条船。我看见一根船柱漂浮在水面，心想一定有船沉了，于是便四处寻找，结果找到了它。那是一条三桅纵帆船，可以看得见几根船柱的残桩从水里冒出头来。船在水里沉得太深，里面的东西弄不出来。于是我继续寻找，想捞到一点油水。对于自己找到的东西，我是有权拥有的。不管是什么，我都应该先弄到手。我离开那条三桅纵帆船，在沙洲上搜寻开去，结果一无所得。我跑出了很远的路，朝着流沙滩前进。在那儿也没找到任何东西，于是又继续向前走。后来望到吕蓓卡灯塔，只见那儿群鸟聚集，在围着什么东西。我走过去探究竟，想看看到底是什么东西。鸟儿黑压压一片，像乌云一样。

可以看见一个像船柱一般的东西从水里戳了出来。我划船向前时，所有的鸟都飞到了空中，围着我盘旋。海水清澈，果真有根船柱什么的在水面上冒出了个尖。我凑到跟前，看见它黑黢黢地沉在水下，像一条长长的黑影。我把船划过去，只见水下有一艘邮轮，静静地躺在水底世界，简直大极了。我的小船就漂浮在这艘巨轮的上方。它身子侧翻，尾部深深下沉，舷窗全都关得死死的。可以看到水下有玻璃在闪光，还可以看到巨轮的整个轮廓。这是我一生中所见过的最大的轮船，而它就躺在那里。我先划着小船从巨轮的这头跑到那头，然后找个地方停好船，再将甲板上的划子拖过来，一推把划子推下水，动手划了起来，飞鸟云集在我的周围盘旋。

我有一副水下观察镜，跟我们捞取海绵动物时戴的防护镜很像。我的手抖得厉害，几乎都拿不稳观察镜了。从轮船的上方划过去，可以看见所有的舷窗都紧闭着。不过，贴近海底的某扇门窗肯定是开着的，因为不时有七零八碎的东西浮上来。说不清那是些什么东西，反正都是些零碎玩意儿吧。那些鸟儿要的就是这些玩意儿。以前从未见过这么多的鸟。它们围着我盘旋，疯狂地聒噪个不停。

一切都看得清清楚楚。只见它躺在水下，看上去有一英里长。它的身下是洁白的沙地。它是侧身斜躺着的，于此可见露出水面的柱子是前桅杆什么的，或者是某种索具吧，斜着伸出了水面。船头位于水下不太深的地方，我可以站在刻在船头的船名那几个字母上，脑袋刚刚露出水来。不过，最近的舷窗也在水下十二英尺远的地方，用杆子刚能够得着。于是我就用杆子击打舷窗，可就是打不破，舷窗上的玻璃太结实了。后来，我划着划子返回小船，取来一把扳子绑在木杆头上击打，可玻璃还是打不碎。用水下观察镜低头看看巨轮，那里边可是藏着宝贝呢。我是发现它的第一人，可惜就是进不去。轮船里的东西恐怕能值五百万元。

一想到那价值连城的宝贝，我就浑身发抖。从离得最近的那扇舷窗望去，可以看到里面有样东西，不过用水下观察镜却分辨不清那究竟是什么东西。用手里的杆子又砸不破舷窗，于是站在那儿深深吸了两口气，然后手持扳子从船尾一个猛子扎入水里，向水下潜去。到了那扇舷窗的边缘跟前，我憋了一会儿气，可以看见里面有个女人，她的头发散开漂浮在水中。她漂浮的样子我看得一清二楚。我用扳子使劲砸玻璃，连砸了两下，耳朵里听得到咣咣的两声响，玻璃却没有砸碎。我只好浮到了水面上。

我紧紧抓住小船喘了口气，然后爬上小船，又一个猛子扎入水里。我向下潜游到那扇舷窗跟前，用手指抓住舷窗的边，然后使出吃奶的力气用扳子猛砸玻璃。透过玻璃，我可以看见那个女人漂在水里，曾经扎起来的头发全都散开了，浮在水中。看得见她的一只手上戴着戒指，就在贴近舷窗的地方。我又连砸两下，而玻璃却连条裂纹都没有。浮上水面时，我心想：这次不到非得换气，就绝不上来。

我又潜入水中，又奋力砸玻璃，可是砸也是白砸。再次浮到水面上，我的鼻子流血不止。我站在轮船的船头，光脚丫子踩在船名的那几个字母上，脑袋刚刚露出水面，在那儿休息了一下，游到划子跟前，爬进划子，坐在划子里等着头疼症消失，一边低头看了看水下观察镜，见上面有鼻血，于是把观察镜在水里洗了洗。接下来，我就躺在划子上，把手堵在鼻子下止血。我躺在那儿仰面望去，见天上足有一百万只鸟在盘旋来盘旋去。

鼻血止住之后，我又检查了一眼观察镜，然后把划子划到我的船跟前，想找一样比扳子更重一些的家伙，却一无所得，连捞海绵动物用的铁钩都没有找到。我返回原处，见海水仍一如既往的清澈，飘落在白沙海底上的东西一览无余。我四处看看，没发现有鲨鱼。有鲨鱼出现，老远都能看得到的。水清极了，沙子白极了。划子上有个泊船用的抓钩，我把它砍了下来，拿着它从划子边扎入水中。铁钩拖着我下沉，经过那扇舷窗时，我用手去抓，却什么也没抓住，于是就继续下沉，沉啊沉的，沿着弯弯的船身一直下沉。最后，我不得不松开了铁钩，听见了嗵的一声响。等我浮上水面时，觉得好像已过了一年之久。划子顺着海潮漂走了。我见状急忙游了过去，一边游一边鼻血直流。十分让人庆幸的是周围没有鲨鱼。不过，我已经精疲力竭了。

我头疼欲裂，于是躺在划子上休息了一下，然后划回小船那儿去。时间在行进，已到了下午时分。我又拿着扳子潜入水中，还是一无所成，因为那扳子太轻了。除非有一个大铁锤，或者有一样重得能干事的家伙，否则潜到水里来屁用都不顶。我把扳子又绑到了杆子上，透过水下观察镜看着，在玻璃上又是击又是砸，最后导致扳子脱落。我从观察镜里看得清清楚楚，看见它顺着轮船的船身滑过，一直朝下落，最后落进了流沙里。我无计可施，只能眼睁睁看着。扳子不见了，铁钩也遗失了，我悻悻地划着划子返回小船。我累坏了，都没有气力把划子拉上小船了。此时，太阳已经很低了。水鸟在撤退，纷纷离开轮船。我把划子向西南礁石湾划去，前后都有水鸟在飞行。我累得浑身都散了架。

那天夜里刮起了大风，连着刮了一个星期。无法再到沉船的地方去。他们从城里跑来，说那个被我砍了一刀的家伙，除了胳膊受了点伤，一点事都没有。于是我回到了城里。他们拿出五百块钱，跟我签了份打捞沉船的协议。结果并不如人意，他们中有我的朋友，信誓旦旦地说要拿把斧头跟我去，可是等我们到了沉船的地方，希腊人早已将船体炸开了，把里面的东西洗劫一空。保险柜也被炸开了，没人知道他们拿走了多少钱。船里装的有金子，都被他们拿走了。他们将东西洗劫了个干净，一点不剩。沉船是我发现的，我却一分钱也没得到。

这场海难真是惨极了。据说暴风袭来时，轮船就在哈瓦那港口外，只是无法进港，或者说船主不允许船长冒险把轮船开进港。船长说想试试也不顶用。就这样，轮船只好接受暴风雨的袭击。天黑时，它顶着狂风试图穿过吕蓓卡灯塔和托尔图加斯之间的海峡，结果撞上了流沙。也许船舵被风刮掉了，或者说没人掌舵，反正稀里糊涂就撞上了。船进流沙时，船长发布了一道命令，叫打开压载舱，好让船固定位置。可是，那可是流沙呀！压载舱一打开，船尾便首先下沉，船体随之侧翻，船舷着地。船上有四百五十名乘客和船员，我发现沉船时，他们肯定都还困在船上。当时的情况一定是这样的：船进流沙，他们立刻打开了压载舱，船体落地之后，被流沙吸了进去。后来，八成是锅炉发生了爆炸，结果弄得碎片到处漂浮。奇怪的是，沉船的地方居然没有鲨鱼。连一条鱼也没有。那么洁白的沙子海底，要是有鱼，我是能够看得见的。

眼下鱼儿倒是不少，都是些大海鲈，个头非常大。沉船的大部分船体埋进了沙子，而这些鱼便游进了船体，全都是巨大型的海鲈。有的鱼一条就重达三四百磅。以后哪一天，就来这儿捕上几条。从沉船处，可以看见吕蓓卡灯塔。灯塔那儿设有浮标。沉船位于流沙地的尽端，紧挨海峡的边缘，再差四百码就能闯过去了。黑灯瞎火地在暴风雨中挣扎，结果功亏一篑。当时雨太大，他们没能看见吕蓓卡灯塔。这种情况对他们来说是不常见的。那样风驰电掣的速度叫轮船的船长很不适应。轮船是有自己的航道的。他们告诉我，说船上安装有可以自动导航的罗盘。暴风雨袭来时，他们大概弄不清自己所处的位置。不过，话又说回来，他们当时差点成功脱险。还有一种可能——船舵被风刮掉了。说来说去，只要进了那个海峡，一直把船开到墨西哥都不会再有什么灾难了。在狂风暴雨之中，一定是遇到了什么险情，船长才命令打开压载舱的。那么大的风雨，甲板上不可能有人，所有的人肯定都进了船舱。待在甲板上会没命的。船舱里肯定出现了哄堂大乱，才导致轮船急速下沉。光看看扳子怎么落进沙子，便知道当时的情况。船长又不熟悉这片水域，不可能知道轮船撞上了流沙。他只知道轮船所撞的不是礁石。他当时一定在船桥指挥室，把一切都看在了眼里。轮船一下沉，他恐怕就已经意识到劫数到了。真不知当时轮船下沉得有多么快。大副是不是跟船长在一起呢？灾难降临时，他们俩是在船桥指挥室里，还是在外边呢？事后，没有发现任何尸体，连一具也没找到。海面上没有浮尸。有救生圈，是可以漂浮很远的路的。看来，灾难降临时，船长和大副一定在指挥室里。希腊人把东西洗劫一空，什么都没有留下。他们来得可真够快的，把轮船洗劫了个干干净净。水鸟先到，接下来是我，然后才是希腊人。就连水鸟得到的东西也比我得到的多。





一个干净明亮的地方


天色已晚，咖啡店里人去屋空，只剩下了一个老人坐在树叶遮出的路灯的灯影里。白日里，街上尘土飞扬，而晚间降了露水，尘土就落下去了。老人喜欢在咖啡店里独坐至很晚，因为他耳聋，晚间清净，他会有不同的感受。店里的两个侍者知道老人有点醉了。老人固然是个好顾客，但他们知道万一他喝得酩酊大醉，走时可能会忘记付账，于是两人就在跟前盯着他。

“上星期他差点没自杀。”一位侍者说。

“为什么？”

“绝望了呗。”

“为什么绝望？”

“什么也不为。”

“你怎么知道什么也不为？”

“他有许多的钱。”

两个侍者坐在墙跟前的一张座子旁，靠近咖啡店的大门，不住眼张望着阳台。阳台上的桌子全空了，只有老人独自坐在随风摇曳的婆娑树影里。一个姑娘和一个士兵从街上走过。路灯的灯光洒在士兵领子上的号码铜牌上。姑娘头上没戴帽子，步履匆匆地随在他的身旁。

“宪兵会把他抓起来的。”一个侍者说。

“如果得到了自己追求的人，抓起来又有什么关系？”

“他最好别在街面上待，不然宪兵会抓他的。这儿五分钟之前还有宪兵走过呢。”

此时，坐在阴影里的老人用玻璃杯碰了碰茶托。年龄较轻的侍者见状走了过去。

“你需要什么？”

老人看了看他，然后说：“再来杯白兰地。”

“你会喝醉的。”侍者说。老人瞥了他一眼。后者抽身离去了。

“他会泡上一夜的。”这位侍者对他的同事说，“我的眼皮子都打架了。我从没在三点之前睡过觉。他上个星期自杀，死了就好了。”

他从店里的柜台取过一瓶白兰地和一个茶托，大步走向老人的桌子，放下茶托，给对方的杯子斟满了白兰地。

“你上个星期自杀，死了就好了。”他冲着耳聋的老人说。老人伸出一个手指，摆了摆说：“再加一点。”侍者又给他加了许多酒，弄得酒液外溢，顺着杯子朝下淌，流进了摞在最上面的茶托里。老人说：“多谢。”侍者拎起酒瓶，回到了店里，在同事的身旁又坐了下来。

“现在他可是喝醉了。”他说。

“他每天晚上都喝醉。”

“他为什么想自杀呢？”

“我怎么知道？”

“他是怎么自杀的？”

“用绳子上吊。”

“是谁把他放下来的？”

“他侄女。”

“为什么放他下来？”

“是怕他的灵魂得不到解救。”

“他有多少钱？”

“多得很。”

“他一定有八十岁了。”

“要让我说，他该有八十岁了。”

“真希望他赶快回家去。三点钟之前我都没有睡过觉。那么晚才睡，该是什么滋味！”

“他熬夜不睡觉，那是因为他喜欢这样。”

“他孤独呗。我可不孤独。家里有个老婆在床上等我呢。”

“他以前也是有老婆的。”

“现在有老婆，对他就没什么意思了。”

“这可说不来。有个老婆，他的境况也许会好一些的。”

“他有侄女照顾呢。你刚才说是她把他从吊绳上放下来的。”

“这我知道。”

“我可不愿活那么长。老了就邋里邋遢的。”

“并不一定。这个老人就干干净净的。他喝酒从不把酒洒出来。即便现在喝醉了也是这样。你可以瞧瞧嘛。”

“我才不愿看他呢，只希望他赶快回家去。人家还得工作呢，他一点也不为别人考虑。”

老人将目光从酒杯移开，看了看广场，然后又看了看这两位侍者。

“再来一杯白兰地。”他指了指酒杯说。急着回家的那个侍者走了过去。

“完事了。”他说道。这话说得缺乏文法，属于大老粗对醉汉或外国人说话的那种方式。“今晚够了。要打烊了。”

“再来一杯。”老人说。

“不行。完事了。”侍者用毛巾擦着桌沿，一边摇了摇头。

老人站起身，慢条斯理地数了数茶托，从衣袋里取出一个装硬币的皮夹子，付了酒钱，留下半个比塞塔作为小费。

侍者目送着他走上大街——一个年迈的老人，脚步不稳，但气质不凡。

“你为什么就不能让他再待待，再喝上一杯呢？”那个不急着回家的侍者问。说话间，两人正在关门窗。“还不到两点半呢。”

“我想回家睡觉呢。”

“迟睡一个小时又算什么？”

“对他不算什么，对我就不一样了。”

“反正就是一个小时的时间么。”

“你说话好像你也七老八十了一样。他可以买瓶酒回家喝么。”

“那是不一样的。”

“是的，是不一样。”家里有老婆的侍者同意了对方的说法。他并不想以不公正的态度待人，只是急着回家罢了。

“你呢？还没到时间就回家，你就不怕吗？”

“你是不是想损我？”

“哪里的话，伙计。只不过开个玩笑嘛。”

“我没什么可怕的。”急着回家的侍者说，一边拉下金属卷门，随后站起了身，“我是有底气的，完全有自信心。”

“你有青春，有底气，有工作，应有尽有呀。”年纪稍大的侍者说。

“你缺什么？”

“除了工作什么都缺。”

“我有的你也都有呀。”

“错了。我从来就没有过底气，而且我也不年轻了。”

“好啦，别说些不着边的话了。快把门锁上吧。”

“我属于那种喜欢在咖啡店泡到很晚的人。”年纪稍大的侍者说，“我喜欢跟那些不愿意睡觉的人在一起，喜欢跟那些夜间需要灯光的人在一起。”

“我是想回家睡觉去了。”

“你我不是一类人呀。”年纪稍大的侍者说。此刻，他已在更衣准备回家了。“虽然青春和自信心是非常美好的东西，但此处并不仅仅涉及这些因素。每天夜间我都不愿关店门，觉得很可能会有人需要来喝上一杯。”

“伙计，他们可以去通宵营业的店呀。”

“你不懂。这家店环境干净，令人愉悦，明明亮亮的。这儿灯光充足，还有婆娑的树影。”

“再见。”年轻的侍者说。

“再见。”年纪稍大的侍者说。他一边关电灯，一边嘴里在自言自语着。灯光固然重要，但干净和令人愉悦的环境也是必需的。你不需要音乐，当然不需要音乐了。你不可能带着自尊站到吧台前，虽然这种时辰也只有自尊跟你相伴了。有什么害怕的呢？其实这不是害怕，也不是恐惧。这是他所熟悉的一种虚空感。万物都是虚空的，就连人也是虚空的。在这个虚空世界里，需要有灯光，还需要有一个干净、整齐的环境。有的人生活在其中，却感觉不到。他知道nada y pues nada y nada y pues nada(1)。名字是虚空，国家是虚空，意志也是虚空，虚空中套着虚空。日常生活是虚空，芸芸众生是虚空，我们从虚空走向虚空，再转移向另一个虚空。欢呼吧，虚空，让世界充满虚空，愿虚空与你同在。冥想期间，他笑盈盈地站在一个吧台前，台上放着一个亮光闪闪的气压咖啡机。

“你要什么？”酒吧招待问。

“虚空。”

“Otro loco más.(2)”酒吧招待嘟哝了一句，就把身子转开了。

“来一小杯吧。”侍者说。

酒吧招待给他倒了杯酒。

“灯光非常明亮，环境令人愉悦，只是吧台应该擦得再亮一些。”侍者说。

酒吧招待瞥了他一眼，但没有搭腔。夜已深，不适合于交谈了。

“想再来一杯吗？”酒吧招待问。

“不了。谢谢。”侍者说完走了出去。他不喜欢酒吧，也不喜欢酒馆。一个干净、明亮的咖啡店可就完全不一样了。他没有再多想，他要回自己的房间去了。他要躺在床上，天亮时分他最终总会入睡的。他对自己说：“没什么了不起的，只不过是失眠症罢了。失眠的人肯定多着呢。”

世界之光明


酒保见我们进门，抬头扫了我们一眼，急忙伸手把玻璃罩罩在了两碗免费的菜肴上。

“给我来杯啤酒。”我说了一声。他打开啤酒桶的龙头放了一杯，用抹刀刮掉上面的一层泡沫，然后将酒杯端在手中。我把五分镍币放在吧台上，他这才将啤酒杯推给了我。

“你要什么？”他问汤姆。

“啤酒。”

他放了一杯，刮掉泡沫，见汤姆付了钱，才把酒杯推给了他。

“怎么啦？”汤姆问。

酒保没吱声，从我们头顶上方望去，冲着一个刚进门的汉子问道：“你要什么？”

“黑麦威士忌。”那汉子说。酒保摆出一瓶酒和酒杯，另外还有一杯水。

汤姆一伸手，把免费菜肴碗上的玻璃罩拿掉。原来是一碗腌猪蹄，里面还有一件木质食具，样子像剪刀，末端有两个木叉，用来叉猪蹄吃。

“这可不行。”酒保说完，将玻璃罩又盖回了碗上。汤姆却把剪刀一样的木叉拿在了手里。“放回去。”酒保说。

“去你的吧。”汤姆说。

酒保把一只手伸到吧台下，怒目望着我们俩。我把五毛钱放到吧台上，他这才把弯下去的腰又挺直了。

“你要什么？”他问。

“啤酒。”我说。他揭开了两个碗上的玻璃罩，然后去放啤酒。

“这他妈的猪蹄子是臭的。”汤姆说完，呸的一口把吃到嘴里的肉吐到了地上。酒保没吱声。那个刚进门的汉子把黑麦威士忌喝完，付了账，头也不回地走了。

“你自己才是臭的呢。”酒保说，“你们这帮无赖全都臭烘烘的。”

“他说咱们是无赖。”汤姆对我说。

“好啦，”我说，“咱们走吧。”

“你们这帮无赖快滚蛋吧。”酒保说。

“我说过要走的，”我说，“不是你撵我们走就走。”

“我们还会再来的。”汤米(1)说。

“不，你们可别来了。”酒保冲着他说。

“瞧他把咱们冤枉的。”汤姆对我说。

“快走吧。”我说。

到了外边的感觉很好。天色已经黑了下来。

“这鬼地方是哪儿？”汤姆问。

“我也不知道。”我说，“咱们还是到车站去吧。”

我们是从一个方向进的城，现在则从另一个方向出城。四处飘散着皮革味、树皮味，以及大堆大堆的锯末散发出的气味。进城时，天刚擦黑，而此时天已黑透。空气寒冷，路上有水洼，水洼的边都结上了冰。

车站上有五个烟花女子在等火车进站，另外还有五个白人男子和四个印第安人。候车室里显得很拥挤，炉子烧得热烘烘的，烟雾缭绕。我们进屋时，没有人说话，售票窗的窗口关着。

“请把门关上，好不好？”有个人说道。

我张目望去，想看看说话的是何人。原来是那几个白人男子当中的一个在发声。他下穿沾着木屑的裤子，脚蹬伐木工橡胶鞋，上身穿的是方格厚呢衣，跟另几个人装束一样，只是没戴帽子，脸色发白，两只手又白又瘦。

“你到底关不关呀？”

“当然要关。”我说完把门关上了。

“谢谢。”他说。

那些人当中，有一个扑哧笑了，对我说道：“你跟厨子拌过嘴吗？”

“没有。”

“那你可以跟这个厨子拌拌嘴。”他说着用眼瞅了瞅那位“厨子”，“他喜欢跟人拌嘴。”

那个厨子把脸掉开不去看他，嘴唇绷得紧紧的。

“他把柠檬汁涂在手上，”那人说，“死也不愿把手放进水里洗碗。你瞧瞧，这手多白。”

一个烟花女子哈哈大笑出了声。我一辈子都没见过块头这么大的烟花女子，也没见过块头这么大的良家女。她身穿一种能改变颜色的绸缎服装。另两个烟花女子也同样身躯庞大，不过，发笑的这位论体重一定有三百五十磅。你看她的时候，简直都不敢相信她是个有血有肉的真人。她们三个穿的都是能改变颜色的绸缎服装，并排坐在凳子上，块头大得似小山。另外的两个看上去与普通妓女无异，金色的头发都用化学剂漂染过。

“诸位瞧瞧他的手哟。”那位调侃的男子一边说，一边冲着厨子摇头晃脑的。大块头烟花女子又哈哈大笑起来，笑得浑身发抖。

厨子转过身来，用急速的语调对她说：“你这个让人恶心的肥婆娘！”

大块头仍大笑不止，浑身颤抖着。

“哎呀，我的基督呀！”她的声音很好听，“哎呀，我可爱的基督呀！”

另两个烟花女子，一对大块头，却一声不吭，表现得文文静静，就好像没感觉似的。不过，虽说她们表现得文雅，块头却太大了，跟身躯最为庞大的那个差不了多少。她们少说也有两百五十磅，一个个装出很体面的样子。

那几位男子，除了厨子和那个调侃的，还有两个伐木工，一个在听，兴趣盎然的，但很是腼腆，另一个则跃跃欲试，似乎想插话。这群人里面，还有两个瑞典人。两个印第安人坐在长凳的另一头，还有一个靠墙根站着。

那个想插话的男子用非常低的声音对我说：“骑在上面，就像躺在干草堆上。”

我听了笑得肚子疼，把这话传给了汤米。

“我对天发誓，我可从来没有睡过这样的干草堆。”汤米说，“你瞧瞧她们三个的身段！”

此时只听厨子问道：“你们二位多大了？”

“我九十六，他六十九。”汤米说。

“哈！哈！哈！”大块头烟花女子又爆发出一阵笑声，浑身颤抖着。她的声音的确非常好听。另两个女子却面无笑意。

“喂，你就不能正经点吗？”厨子诘问，“我问你话可是客客气气的。”

“我们俩一个十七岁，一个十九岁。”我说道。

“你这是咋啦？”汤米转过头来问我。

“没什么。”

“你们叫我爱丽丝好啦。”大块头烟花女子说完又笑得浑身发抖。

“这是你的名字？”汤米问。

“当然喽。”她说，“就是叫爱丽丝，对不对？”她转身问坐在厨子旁边的那个男子。

“是叫爱丽丝。一点不错。”

“你就应该有这样的名字。”厨子说。

“这是我的真实名字。”爱丽丝说。

“敢问另两位姑娘的芳名？”汤米问。

“一个是黑兹尔，一个是埃塞尔。”爱丽丝说。黑兹尔和埃塞尔嫣然一笑。她们俩都不十分机灵。

“敢问你的芳名？”我问其中的一个金发女。

“弗朗西斯。”她说。

“弗朗西斯什么？”

“弗朗西斯·威尔逊。你问这干什么？”

“你的芳名呢？”我问另一位金发女子。

“得啦，别太放肆了。”对方说。

“他只不过想让大家交个朋友么。”那位调侃男说道，“难道你不想交朋友吗？”

“不想。”用化学剂染过头发的这位女子说，“不想跟你们交朋友。”

“简直就是个小辣椒。”调侃男说，“一个地地道道的小辣椒。”

这位金发女瞅了瞅另一位金发女，摇了摇头，口中骂了一句：“真是一群土包子。”

爱丽丝又哈哈大笑起来，笑得浑身发抖。

“没什么滑稽可笑的。”厨子说，“你们就知道笑，但没什么滑稽可笑的。你们这两个小伙子，准备到哪儿去呀？”

“你这是要到哪儿去？”汤姆反问道。

“我要去凯迪拉克(2)。”厨子说，“你们去过吗？我妹妹住在那里。”

“他本人也是个小妹妹哟。”裤子上沾有木屑的那个男子说。

“你能不能说话别这么阴阳怪气的？”厨子问，“大家就不能说些正经话吗？”

“凯迪拉克是史蒂夫·凯奇尔的老家，阿德·沃尔卡斯特(3)也是那儿的人。”那位腼腆的男子说。

“提起史蒂夫·凯奇尔，”其中的一个金发女提高嗓门说，就好像这个名字点着了她心里的一个火药桶似的，“他被杀死了，是他亲老子开枪打死的。天呀，虎毒都不会食子呀。像史蒂夫·凯奇尔这样的男人再也找不到了。”

“他的名字该不会叫斯坦利·凯奇尔(4)吧？”厨子问。

“得啦，你给我住口！”金发女说，“提起史蒂夫，你知道个什么呀？还说叫斯坦利呢！他不叫斯坦利！史蒂夫·凯奇尔是天底下最潇洒、最英俊的男子汉，是个天下无双的好男儿。他虎虎生威，风流倜傥，花钱极为豪爽。”

“你认识他吗？”那些男子当中的一位启口问道。

“认识他？问我是不是认识他？还问我是不是爱他吧？这是你要问的吧？我认识他，就跟你认识天下任何人；我爱他，就跟你爱上帝一样。史蒂夫·凯奇尔是最伟大、最潇洒、最白净、最英俊的男子汉，可是他的亲老子却开枪打死了他，像打死一条狗一样。”

“你和他一起到海边去过？”

“没有。在这之前我就认识他了。他是我唯一爱过的男人。”

这个用化学剂染过头的金发女说得绘声绘色，产生了舞台效应，令大家肃然起敬，而爱丽丝却又浑身抖了起来。我就坐在她身旁，感觉得到。

“你当时应该嫁给他呀。”厨子说。

“我不愿耽误了他的事业。”染过头的金发女说，“我不愿拖他的后腿呀。他所需要的不是老婆。哎，上帝，他是个多么了不起的人啊！”

“这样看待问题是很好的。”厨子说，“不过，杰克·约翰逊(5)还不是把他击倒了么？”

“那是搞阴谋诡计。”染过头的金发女说，“那个大个子黑人来了个突然袭击。当时他已经击倒了杰克·约翰逊，战胜了那个大个子黑杂种。可是那个黑杂种却搞偷袭，取得了胜利。”

说话间，售票窗的窗口打开了。那三个印第安人走了过去。

“是史蒂夫击倒了他。”金发女说，“史蒂夫还扭过头冲我笑呢。”

“记得你刚才说你没有去过海边呀。”旁边有人插话说。

“哦，为了那场比赛，我专门去了一趟。当时史蒂夫冲我笑，而那个黑杂种趁机一跃而起，出其不意地给了他一个冷拳。正面交锋，那样的黑杂种就是来上一百个，都可以被史蒂夫放翻。”

“他是个了不起的拳击手。”那个伐木工说。

“凭良心说，他的确如此。”金发女说，“凭良心说，如今再也没有那么出色的拳击手了。他就像个天神一样，那么白净、英俊，动作如行云流水，或者像一道闪电，虎虎生威。”

“我在拳击电影里看到过他。”汤姆说。

此时，大伙儿无不动容。爱丽丝又浑身发抖了，我偏头一看，却发现她在哭。那几个印第安人买了票，已经出了候车室到站台上去了。

“若论当丈夫，他比哪个丈夫都要强。”金发女说，“在上帝的眼里，我们已喜结良缘。我现在属于他，以后永远属于他。我整个人都是他的。对于我的肉体，我并不在乎，他们可以占有我的肉体，而我的灵魂却属于史蒂夫·凯奇尔一人。上帝啊，他是个真正的男子汉！”

大家都感到心里不是个滋味。此时的气氛有点伤感和尴尬。后来，仍在浑身颤抖的爱丽丝开了腔。“你睁着眼说瞎话。”她低着嗓门说，“你这一辈子从来就没有跟史蒂夫·凯奇尔睡过觉。这你自己清楚。”

“你怎么能这么说？”金发女带着几分傲岸之气说道。

“我这么说，因为这是事实。”爱丽丝说，“这里只有我一人认识史蒂夫·凯奇尔。我来自曼瑟洛纳，在那里我就认识他了。这是事实，人人都知道这是事实。如有半句瞎话，我就遭天打五雷轰。”

“如撒谎，我也愿遭天打五雷轰。”金发女说。

“我说的是事实，是铁的事实，这你应该是知道的，并非捏造出来的。我还记得他对我说的话来着。”

“他说什么？”金发女趾高气扬地问。

爱丽丝泣不成声，浑身发抖，话都快说不出来了。“他说：‘你是个小可爱，爱丽丝。’这是他的原话。”

“信口雌黄。”金发女傲气凌人地说。

“绝非信口雌黄，而是实话，是大实话。我可以对基督和圣母玛利亚发誓。”

“史蒂夫不可能说这话。那不是他说话的风格。”金发女高兴地说。

“这是事实。”爱丽丝以她那种好听的声音回了一句，“你相信不相信，反正对我都无所谓。”她不再哭了，心情平静了下来。

“史蒂夫说那话，可就成了天方夜谭了。”金发女不依不饶地说。

“他的确说了。”爱丽丝说完，脸上涌出了笑容，“当时的情景我还记着呢。我当时正如他说的那样，的确挺可爱的。就现在而言，我也比你强。看你干巴巴的，连点水分都没有。”

“不许你侮辱我，”金发女说道，“你这个大肉山。我对过去有自己的回忆。”

“得了吧。”爱丽丝以她那种甜蜜蜜、好听的声音说道，“除了你跟张三李四睡觉是真的，其他的回忆都是子虚乌有，都是你从报纸上看来的。我为人清正，这你心里有数。虽然我块头大，可是男人们都喜欢我。你知道得很清楚。我没说过半句瞎话，这你也清楚。”

“我的回忆就是我的回忆，”金发女说，“是真实的回忆，美好的回忆。”

爱丽丝看看她，再看看我们，脸上的那种受伤害的神情不见了，而是笑盈盈的，一张脸显得无比漂亮。她脸蛋漂亮，细皮嫩肉，声音悦耳，待人亲和，简直友好极了。不过，她的身躯太庞大了，大得能顶三个女人。汤姆见我盯着她瞧，便在一旁说了一声：“好啦，咱们走吧。”

“再见。”爱丽丝说，声音听上去的确像莺声燕语。

“再见。”我说。

“你们两位小伙子去哪儿呀？”厨子问。

“跟你走的不是一条路。”汤姆回话说。

愿诸位快乐，先生们


那些日子跟现在截然两样，差距很大。现在，那些山头被削平了，而当时山头上的尘土被风刮得满世界都是，把个堪萨斯城弄得和君士坦丁堡差不多了。有件事也许你不会相信，没人会相信的，然而却是真的。那天下午雪花飞舞，天黑得早，汽车商行的橱窗里亮着灯，陈列着一辆赛车，通体银色抛光，引擎盖上印有Dans Argent字样。我觉得这几个字母的意思是“银舞”或“银舞者”。它们究竟是什么意思，我心里还是有些拿不准的。不过，看见漂亮的赛车，我感到一阵高兴，并且对自己懂一门外语颇为得意。我踏雪前行。沃尔夫兄弟酒家每逢圣诞节和感恩节就提供免费火鸡大餐，我这是刚离开那儿，往市立医院走。那座医院位于高高的山丘上，俯瞰城里的万家炊烟、住房以及街道。医院的接待室里有两个救护医生——费希尔医生和威尔科克斯医生，一个坐在桌旁，一个坐在靠墙根的椅子上。

费希尔医生瘦瘦的，沙黄色头发，薄嘴唇，双眼含笑，有着两只赌徒的手。威尔科克斯医生矮矮的个子，肤色黝黑，手里拿着一本附有索引的书，书名是《青年医生之友和指南》，是百事通般的参考书，介绍各种症状和疗法。书里还附有对照索引，可以对照着参考本书诊断的症状。费希尔医生曾建议今后再版时应该再增加些对照索引，这样参考疗法时，可以同时了解疾病本身以及症状。按他的话说是为了“帮助记忆”。

威尔科克斯医生对这本书不太感兴趣，但离了它又寸步难行。此书是软皮革面的，适合于放入外套衣袋中。他是听了一位教授的建议才买下的。那位教授曾对他说：“威尔科克斯，你没有做医生的资格，我曾竭尽全力阻止你获得资格证。现在你既然成了这个需要学识的行业的一个成员，我从人道主义的立场出发建议你买一本《青年医生之友和指南》，照着里面的要求做。威尔科克斯医生，要学会用这本书。”

威尔科克斯医生没吱声，但他当天就把这本软皮革面的指南买来了。

“你好，贺拉斯。”我进接待室时，费希尔医生打了声招呼。接待室里真是五味俱杂，有纸烟味、三碘甲烷味、焦炭味，还有一种热得发烫的暖气片的味。

“先生们好。”我回了一句。

“市场上有什么新闻吗？”费希尔医生问。他说话拿腔拿调，带点夸张的气味，但我却觉得他温文尔雅的。

“沃尔夫兄弟酒家有免费火鸡大餐。”我回答说。

“你去吃啦？”

“大快朵颐。”

“咱们的同事有许多都去了吧？”

“全班人马。所有的人都去了。”

“圣诞节那种欢快的气氛很浓吧？”

“不太浓。”

“威尔科克斯医生在这里也算大快朵颐了哟。”费希尔医生说。威尔科克斯医生抬头望望他，然后又看看我。

“想喝一杯吗？”他问。

“不了。谢谢。”我说。

“那好吧。”威尔科克斯医生说。

“贺拉斯，”费希尔医生说道，“叫你贺拉斯，你不介意吧？”

“不介意。”

“贺拉斯老兄，出现了一个病例，简直有意思极了。”

“是这样的。”威尔科克斯医生说。

“你知道昨天到这来的那个小伙子吧？”

“哪一个？”

“就是想做阉割手术的那个。”

“知道。”他来的时候，我在场。那是个十六岁光景的小伙子，来时没戴帽子，情绪极为激动，一副害怕的样子，但却决心很大。他卷头发，虎背熊腰，双唇外凸。

“你看什么病，小伙子？”威尔科克斯医生当时问他。

“我想做阉割手术。”小伙子回答。

“为什么？”费希尔医生问。

“我做了祷告，什么措施都采取了，可就是不管用。”

“对什么事情不管用？”

“就是那种可怕的情欲。”

“什么可怕的情欲呀？”

“就是那种冲动，一种无法遏制的冲动。我一个劲儿祈祷，祈祷了一夜。”

“到底是怎么回事？”费希尔医生问。

小伙子一五一十把情况讲了。

“听我说，小伙子，”费希尔医生说道，“你一点毛病也没有，这种情况很正常，是无可指摘的。”

“这是可悲的，”小伙子说，“是一种罪恶，一种不洁行为，一种反天主和救世主的罪恶。”

“不对。”费希尔医生说，“这是一种自然现象，合乎人之常理，以后想起来你会觉得自己没做阉割是很幸运的。”

“哎，你是不明白。”小伙子说。

“还是听我的吧。”费希尔医生说。随后，他给小伙子介绍了一些常识。

“不，我不听。你别想让我信这些。”

“请你听我的劝告。”费希尔医生说。

“你是个十足的大傻瓜。”威尔科克斯医生对小伙子说道。

“那么，你们是不愿做了？”小伙子问道。

“做什么呀？”

“给我做阉割手术呗。”

“听着，”费希尔医生说道，“没有人会给你做这种手术的。你的身体一点毛病都没有。你的身体很棒，不要再胡思乱想了。如果你是个信徒，你所不满的其实并非罪恶现象，而是一种完成圣礼的途径罢了。”

“它说来就来，让我无法遏制。”小伙子说，“我不分日夜地祈祷都不管用。这是一种罪恶，挥之不去的罪恶，是不贞洁的。”

“行啦，得了吧……”威尔科克斯医生说道。

“你这样说话我可不愿听。”小伙子不卑不亢地对威尔科克斯医生说。接着，他又央求费希尔医生道：“你能不能把手术做了？”

“不行。”费希尔医生说道，“我已经告诉过你了，小伙子。”

“让他从这里出去。”威尔科克斯医生说道。

“我会出去的。”小伙子说，“你别碰我，我会出去的。”

以上的情况出现在昨天五点钟左右。

“后来怎么样啦？”我问。

“今天凌晨一点钟，”费希尔医生说，“我们收治了一个用剃刀自残的青年。”

“是给自己做阉割？”

“不是阉割。”费希尔医生说，“他就不懂阉割是怎么回事。”

“他也许会因此送命的。”威尔科克斯医生说。

“怎么送命？”

“因为失血呗。”

“这位优秀的医生——威尔科克斯医生，我的同事，当时接诊，却在这本指南里找不到应急措施。”

“去你的吧，乱讲个啥劲。”威尔科克斯医生说。

“我的医生，我说此话并无恶意。”费希尔医生说道，一边看了看自己的两只手——由于乐意为人效力，又无视联邦法律，这双手老是给他找麻烦。“贺拉斯在此可以做证，我说此话并无恶意。那个年轻人做的是切割手术，贺拉斯。”

“好啦，希望你不要再挖苦我了。”威尔科克斯医生说。“何必要挖苦人呢。”

“挖苦你，医生？在咱们救世主的诞辰这么一个日子挖苦你？”

“咱们的救世主？你不是个犹太人么？”威尔科克斯医生说。

“我是犹太人，我是犹太人。我老忘记这一点，还是重视不够吧。谢谢你的好心提醒。是你们的救世主。这就对了。是你们的救世主，毫无疑问是你们的救世主。在棕枝主日(1)也是不行的。”

“你也太聪明了吧。”威尔科克斯医生说。

“这个诊断妙极了，医生。我的确太聪明了些。在这个区域当然显得太聪明了些。你可要引以为戒，贺拉斯。你并无意出人头地，但有时可见端倪。那个诊断真够神的——而且没有参考指南。”

“下地狱去吧。”威尔科克斯医生说。

“时候到了我会去的。”费希尔医生说。“时候到了我会去的。假如有这样的地方，我肯定会去的。我甚至还往那儿看过一眼呢，只不过是匆匆一窥罢了。看过之后，我急忙将目光移开了。贺拉斯，这位优秀的医生收治那个年轻人时，你知道那个年轻人说什么来着？他说：‘哼，我曾求过你们做这个手术，不知求了多少次了。’”

“而且是在圣诞日苦苦央求来着。”威尔科克斯医生说。

“至于什么特殊的日子并不重要。”费希尔医生说。

“也许对你来说不重要。”威尔科克斯医生说。

“听见了吧，贺拉斯？”费希尔医生说道。“听见了吧？这位医生发现了我的软肋，即所谓的‘阿喀琉斯脚踵(2)’，于是便乘胜追击。”

“你也太聪明了吧。”威尔科克斯医生说。

你们决不愿这样


洼地公路和那片农房的机枪扫射曾阻住了部队的进攻，但他们最终还是穿过田野进了小镇。小镇上没有遇到抵抗，他们又一路打到了河边。尼古拉斯·亚当斯骑自行车走在路上，遇见路面太坑洼，就下车推着走。只见尸横遍野，他猜得到战况是多么惨烈。

那些尸体横七竖八躺在田野上的荒草中或者路面上，口袋翻出，苍蝇乱飞，无论是零星尸体还是堆放着的尸体，旁边纸片狼藉。

路旁的草地上和庄稼地里，以及道路的一些路面上，七零八碎地乱扔着军用物资，其中有：一台行军灶（一定是战况好的时候随军用的）；许多带有小牛皮盖的粗帆布背包、手榴弹、钢盔、步枪（有的步枪枪托朝天，刺刀倒插在泥土里，据此判断此处最后还大力挖战壕呢）；除了手榴弹、钢盔、步枪，还有挖战壕用的工具、弹药箱、信号枪以及散落一地的信号弹，另外也可见药品箱、防毒面具、装防毒面具用的空筒、一挺躺在那儿的三脚架机枪和一堆空弹壳、从弹药箱里露出来的装得满满的子弹夹、侧翻了的冷却水空桶；机枪的枪栓不见了，几个机枪手东倒西歪地横尸于旁边，周围的草地上跟他处一样也纸片狼藉。

乱纸堆里有几本祈祷书和几张合影照片，照片上的人正是这几位机枪手，站得整整齐齐，满面红光，兴高采烈，就像是一张大学年刊刊用的校足球队的合影。眼下，他们歪七扭八横尸于荒草地，尸体已有些发胀。乱纸堆里还有一些印有宣传画的明信片，上面画着一个身穿奥地利军服的士兵正把一个女子压倒在床上；该宣传画采用的是印象派技法，画面极为生动，只是与通常的强奸状况不符，因为施暴者通常要将女子的裙子撩起蒙在她的脸上，让她喊不出声来，有时会有帮衬者骑在女子的头上。这种带有教唆味道的明信片到处可见，显然是进攻之前发给士兵们的。现在，它们与淫秽明信片及照片一道散落在战场上。此外，还可见乡下照相馆为农村姑娘拍的小照片，有时还能看到几张小孩的照片，再下来就是家信了，一封封的到处都是。打仗时，凡是有尸体的地方必定纸片狼藉，这次进攻战的战场上也不例外。

对于这些刚刚阵亡的将士，活着的人漠不关心，只关心他们衣袋里的东西。尼克(1)注意到，我方阵亡人数（他一直将这支军队视为我军）少得让人感到意外。死者的衣服也被撕开，衣袋被掏空。根据他们躺着的姿势，可以判断出进攻部队采用的是什么方式和战术。由于天气太热，死者不分国籍，都有些发胀。

显然，奥地利军在洼地公路那儿设有防线，对小镇进行防御，一直坚持到了最后，退回小镇的人寥寥无几，或者说无一生还。小镇的街道上只有三具尸体，看来是逃跑时被打死的。一幢幢的房屋毁于炮火，街上到处是破碎的水泥块和砖瓦，处处可见残梁断壁及炮弹坑（有些弹坑的边缘被芥子气熏得发黄）。碎弹片遍及四处，瓦砾堆里散落着大大小小的弹壳。镇上空无一人。

自从离开福纳西，尼克·亚当斯在路上连个人影也没看到过。不过，沿着公路骑行，穿过郁郁葱葱的田野，倒是可以在路的左侧瞧见一些大炮藏在用桑叶编织的伪装网之下——他是发现太阳把金属的炮身照得发烫，因而伪装网的上方升腾起热浪，才注意到那些大炮的。此刻从镇上走过，见小镇已成了空城，不禁感到有些意外。镇外的河岸旁，就是那条洼地公路。出了镇，有一片光秃秃的空地，那条路从空地顺坡而下，放眼望去，可以看见平静的河面以及对岸弧形的矮堤，还可以看到奥地利军队挖战壕挖出来的泥土——那些泥土已被太阳晒得发白。久别故地，只见眼前一片青翠，绿意盎然，历史的车轮从这儿碾过，并没有使这儿发生变化，低地的河流依然在潺潺流淌。

部队的防线沿河岸一字排开，向左侧延伸。堤岸的顶上挖了些掩体，掩体里有几个士兵。尼克注意到阵地上架着机关枪，信号火箭放在架子上处于待发状态。堤岸侧腰上的掩体里也有士兵，都在呼呼大睡。没有人询问他。他放开步子前行，沿着土堤走，转了个弯。就在这时，一个年轻的少尉闪了出来，一脸的胡茬，眼里布满了血丝，眼皮红肿，把手枪的枪口对准了他。

“你是什么人？”

尼克介绍了自己的身份。

“我怎么知道呢？”

尼克出示了通行证，上面有他的照片、姓名以及第三军的印章。

少尉将证件抓在手里说：“把这个留在我这里吧。”

“这恐怕不行。”尼克说，“把证件还给我，收起你的枪。好啦，把枪放回枪套里去。”

“我怎么知道你是什么人呢？”

“证件上都写着呢。”

“万一证件是伪造的呢？这个证得留在我这里。”

“请别开玩笑了，”尼克笑盈盈地说，“还是带我去见你们的连长吧。”

“我得带你到营部里去。”

“那好吧。”尼克说，“问一声，你认识不认识帕拉维西尼上尉？高高的个子，留着小胡子。他曾经是建筑师，会说英语。”

“你跟他熟？”

“有点熟。”

“他指挥的是哪个连？”

“第二连。”

“现在他指挥一个营了。”

“太好了。”尼克说。一听说帕拉(2)安然无恙，他心里的一块石头落了地。“那就到营部里去吧。”

尼克走出小镇时，曾有三颗榴霰弹在一幢被炸毁了的房屋的右上方爆炸，那以后就再也没有了炮击。可是这位少尉哭丧着脸，好像饱受炮击之苦似的。他说话的声音也显得很紧张，听上去有点不自然。他持枪在手，叫尼克觉得心里不安。

“把枪收起来吧。”他说，“跟敌人隔着一条河呢。”

“万一你是个奸细，我会一枪毙了你的。”少尉说道。

“得了吧。”尼克说，“咱们到营部再理论吧。”这个军官让他的一颗心老是悬着。

营部设在防空洞里，代理营长帕拉维西尼上尉坐在办公桌后，比以前瘦了些，英国味也更浓了些。尼克冲他敬礼，他起身迎迓。

“你好呀！”他说道，“都认不出你来了。穿这身军装干什么？”

“是他们叫我穿的。”

“见到你非常高兴，尼古拉(3)。”

“是呀。你的气色很好。战况如何？”

“我们发动了一次非常漂亮的进攻。简直漂亮极了。让我来给你讲一讲吧。你瞧！”

他指着作战图，介绍了那场进攻战的战况。

“我是从福纳西过来的，”尼克说，“一路可以看得清当时的战况。这一仗打得的确很精彩。”

“不是一般的精彩，简直精彩极了。你的关系现在挂靠在团部吗？”

“不是的。我的任务是到处游走，让他们看看这身军装。”

“真是咄咄怪事。”

“他们看见这身美国军装，就一定会想到大批的美国兵在源源不断赶来。”

“他们怎么知道这是美国军装呢。”

“你做做宣传呗。”

“啊，是的，我明白了。我派个下士给你带路，陪你视察前线。”

“都快成了个肮脏的政客了。”尼克说。

“你穿便装，才更招眼呢。在这儿，那才叫与众不同呢。”

“再戴一顶卷边毡帽哟。”尼克说。

“或者戴一顶毛茸茸的软呢帽。”

“按说，我的口袋里应该塞满香烟、明信片之类的东西。”尼克说，“还应该有满满一口袋巧克力。我应该把这些东西分发给士兵们，外加一句亲切的话语，同时友好地拍拍他们的脊背。可惜我既无香烟和明信片，也无巧克力。于是他们就会说我的视察是摆谱。”

“我觉得你露露面对部队就是莫大的鼓舞。”

“劝你别这么想。”尼克说，“我心里觉得挺不是滋味的。按道理，我应该给你带来一瓶白兰地才对。”

“没什么道理可按的。”帕拉说完，笑了笑。这一笑，露出了他的满口黄牙，这之前他并未笑过。“这话说得十分入耳。来杯格拉巴酒(4)怎么样？”

“不了。谢谢。”尼克说。

“这酒一点乙醚也不含。”

“直到现在，我的嘴里还有那种味道呢。”尼克突然忆及往事，当时的情景历历在目。

“那次搭乘卡车返回营地，要是不听你说胡话，我根本还不知道你喝醉了呢。”

“每次进攻之前，我都要醉他一通。”尼克说。

“我就不行。”帕拉说，“第一次冲锋之前我倒是喝过一次痛快酒。那可是我参加的第一场战斗！喝了酒反倒让我情绪极为低落，后来又渴得要命。”

“你不需要酒壮胆。”

“你冲锋打仗，比我要勇敢多了。”

“过奖了。”尼克说，“我知道自己的斤两，所以老靠酒壮胆。我觉得这没什么丢人的。”

“以前可没见你喝醉过。”

“真的？”尼克说，“一次也没见过？那一次呢？就是咱们一道乘车从梅斯特雷到格兰德港去的那天夜里。当时我想睡觉，便醉醺醺地将自行车当成了毯子，竟然拉过来盖在了身上。”

“那又不是在前线。”

“我怎么样，咱们就不谈了。”尼克说，“我是个什么样的人，我自己最清楚，此时不愿再多想了。”

“你可以在这儿先休息一下。”帕拉维西尼说，“想睡就睡一会儿。炮弹是落不到这儿来的。反正天气正热，是出不去的。”

“我看也不用鬼吹火似的赶。”

“你到底怎么样？”

“很好。一切都很好。”

“算啦。我问的是真话。”

“一点问题都没有。只是睡觉时没有灯光就睡不着。就这么一点小毛病。”

“我早就说过应该做个手术。我虽然不是医生，但这种症状我是知道的。”

“哦，他们认为最好还是让它慢慢吸收。反正就是这么回事了。怎么啦？你是不是觉得我不正常？”

“你看上去正常极了。”

“你如果被诊断为不正常，麻烦可就大了。”尼克说，“那时，没有人会信任你了。”

“我要是你，就睡上一会儿，尼古拉。”帕拉维西尼说，“在这个营部里，情况跟以前是不一样的。我们原地待命，时刻准备开拔。这大热天不能出去——那是犯傻。劝你在那个铺上睡一会儿吧。”

“那我就躺一躺吧。”尼克说。

他在铺上躺了下来。他心绪不宁，这叫他很失望，最叫他失望的是，他的心事让帕拉维西尼一眼就看了出来。这个防空洞不如以前的那个大。在以前的那个防空洞里隐蔽着一个排的士兵，全都是1899年出生的新兵，都是刚上前线，冲锋前一有炮弹落下就叽里哇啦乱叫。帕拉当时让他带新兵出洞锻炼胆量，每次带两个。他自己也害怕，便将钢盔的细带紧紧勒在嘴上，不让嘴唇打哆嗦。新兵们歇斯底里地发作，也是身不由己呀。都知道新兵怕打炮么。如果他们叽里哇啦乱叫，就兜头揍他们一拳，令他们不再胡思乱想。要不然就来个杀鸡给猴看，枪毙他一个。不过，此时以儆效尤恐怕太晚了，情况可能会更糟的。揍他们一拳就行了。进攻的时间提前到了五点二十分，只剩下四分钟了。对待那些窝囊废，揍他们几拳、踢他们几脚就是了。这能让他们克服恐惧？假如还不管用，就枪毙两个，把其余的都赶出去冲锋。中士呀，你可要在后边压阵。你打头阵，后边却无人跟上，那样作战是不行的。你冲锋，也得带着他们一道冲。管什么枪林弹雨！对，就这么行动！你可以看看表，然后以平静的语气，以一丝不乱的平静语气说：“出发！”这次，他没有喝酒，没时间找酒喝。防空洞的一头彻底坍塌了，于是就找不到酒了。正因为没喝酒，他才能够督战。大家冲上了山坡——这是他唯一的一次没喝醉酒便上了战场。返回时，他们发现索道房被大火烧毁了。四天之后，一些伤员撤下了山，还有些没有撤下来。战斗成了拉锯战，攻一攻，守一守，最后全都撤了下来。戈比·德里斯的样子太怪了，满身羽毛。一年前你曾把我叫作芭比娃娃，说很高兴和我认识，有羽毛也罢，没有羽毛也好。戈比可真是好样的。我的名字叫哈里·皮尔瑟。每次攀爬陡峭的山坡，我们都会掉队，远远落在后边。夜夜他在梦中都会看到那座山，梦见圣心堂(5)，白白的，像吹起来的肥皂泡沫。有时他和女友一道去圣心堂，有的时候女友却陪别的人一起去，这叫他困惑不解。女友不在跟前的那些夜晚，河水泛滥，河面格外的宽、格外的平缓；步出福萨尔塔(6)，可见一座低矮的房屋，房屋用油漆漆成了黄色，四面杨柳婆娑，旁边有一个低矮的马棚，附近运河流淌。这地方他来了都有一千次了，却从未发现有这么一座房屋。现在则每一夜都看得到它，跟那座山一样清清楚楚，不过他每次见了都有些害怕。这房屋的意义似乎无比深刻，他每天夜里都能梦见。他渴望见到这房屋，可是见了又害怕。特别是运河上的树影里静静地停泊着一条小船，而河岸变了样，这些就更叫他害怕了。运河的河岸低极了，和格兰德港那儿的一样。记得在格兰德港时，眼见得士兵们涉过泛滥的河水，手里高举着枪，后来连人带枪淹没在了水里。那是谁下的命令来着？要不是心里乱成了一团麻，他是可以想起来的。正因为如此，他才关心细节，让事情脉络清晰，免得迷失方向。可是，怎么就突然无缘无故地糊涂了起来？此刻，他躺在营部的一张铺上；营长是帕拉；他身穿倒霉的美国军装。他坐起身，举目四看，见大家都在盯着他瞧，而帕拉出了门，于是便又躺了下来。

巴黎的那段经历发生在早一些时间，他对此从未有过任何忧虑。他只是为跟别人跑了的女友担心过，害怕他们又遇到先前的那个汽车司机。要说忧虑，就这一点了。至于前线的那点事，他从不为之提心吊胆。他现在做梦，再不会梦见前线的事情了，真叫他害怕，而且梦中无法摆脱的是那幢狭长的黄颜色房子和宽得离奇的河面。眼下，他旧地重游，又来到了河边，又从小镇走过，却没有看见那幢房屋。眼前的河流也跟梦中的大不相同。那么，他夜夜梦中游历的是什么样的地方，遇见的是什么样的危险呢？为什么醒来会冷汗淋漓，对于一幢房屋、一个狭长的马房和一条运河的恐惧，甚至会甚于狂轰滥炸呢？

他一个鲤鱼打挺坐起身，小心地将两条腿从铺上放到地面。两条腿每次伸直的时候，时间一长，就会变得僵硬。那个副官、信号兵以及两个站在门口处的传令兵都在直着眼看他，他也回敬了他们几眼，然后将蒙着布罩的钢盔戴在了头上。

“可惜身上没带巧克力、明信片和香烟，”他说，“只是穿了这身军装来。”

“营长马上就回来。”副官说。在这支军队里，副官并非委任的军衔。

“这套军装不太合身，”尼克说道，“不过，它让大家知道：几百万美国大军马上就要开过来了。”

“你认为他们会把美国人派到这儿来？”副官问。

“哦，这是一定的了。美国兵个个膀大腰圆，块头比我大一倍，身体健康、心地纯洁，夜里睡得香，刀枪不入，不畏炮弹，从不龟缩在洞里，天不怕地不怕，不酗酒，对于留在国内的女友忠心耿耿，多数身上不生虱子，全都是好样的。你们见到就知道了。”

“你是意大利人吧？”副官问。

“不是。我是美国人。你瞧这身军装就知道了，斯帕尼奥利尼公司生产的，只不过不太合身。”

“你是北美人还是南美人(7)？”

“是北美人。”尼克说。他觉得怒从心头起，硬把怒气压了下去。

“可是你说的是意大利语呀。”

“意大利语怎么啦？我说意大利语，难道你不愿意？我就没有权利说意大利语吗？”

“你连意大利的勋章都拿到手了。”

“只是一些绶带和证书罢了。勋章过后补发。勋章是作为纪念的，是作为离别时的奖励，往往会随行李一道失落的。丢了，就到米兰去买几枚。重要的是那些证书。你可不要感到不高兴。你在前线待久了，也会获得这些玩意儿的。”

“按说，我是个老兵了，参加过厄立特里亚(8)战役，”副官语气生硬地说，“还在的黎波里(9)打过仗。”

“和你认识真是莫大的荣幸。”尼克伸出手说，“那些日子一定非常艰苦了。我看到你也有绶带的。顺便问一声，你参加过卡尔索战役吗？”

“那次战役，我年龄太大，不能冲锋陷阵了。这次战争，也是硬把我召来的。”

“我也曾经服过役，打过仗，”尼克说，“如今已解甲归田了。”

“那你为什么还来这儿？”

“演演戏，展示一下美国军装。”尼克说，“你不觉得这样做意义非凡吗？穿在身上领口虽说有点紧，但你很快就会看到几百万美国兵穿着同样的军装蜂拥而至，多得像蝗虫一样。你知道有种虫，我们美国人称其为蚱蜢，其实就是一种蝗虫。真正的蚱蜢个头小，是绿颜色的，气力要弱一些。你可不要把蝗虫和知了弄混了。知了会发一种很特殊的、长长的叫声。它们是怎么叫的来着？一时想不起来了。再怎么想也想不起来了。那叫声仿佛响在耳旁，却又顿然消失。对不起，话说多了，容我歇口气好吗？”

“你去把营长找来！”副官对其中的一个传令兵说道，“看得出你曾经负过伤。”他转过身来对尼克说。

“多处挂彩。”尼克说，“如果你对伤疤感兴趣，我身上倒是有些值得一看。不过，我倒是愿意谈谈蚱蜢。我们称其为蚱蜢，其实就是蝗虫。这种昆虫在我的生活中曾经扮演过十分重要的角色呢。这个你很可能会感兴趣的。你不妨一边听我讲给你听，一边看着这套军装。”

副官摆了摆手，另一个传令兵也出去了。

“你把这身军装可看好啦，是斯帕尼奥利尼公司产的。你们也可以过来看看。”尼克对那几个信号兵说，“其实我并没有军衔，而是在美国领事馆管制下工作。要看，尽管看好了。如果愿意，也可以盯着看。接下来，听我讲讲美国的蝗虫吧。我们一向比较喜欢的是那种所谓‘中褐色’的蝗虫。它们浸在水里很长时间都不会腐烂，鱼儿爱吃。还有一种蝗虫个头大一些，飞的时候发出嘎啦嘎啦的声音，有点像响尾蛇发出的那种声音，听上去干巴巴的。它们的翅膀色彩鲜艳，有的是红艳艳的，有的则是黄底黑条的，但它们的翅膀一遇水就烂掉，当鱼饵用糟透了。中褐色的蝗虫则不然，它们丰满、结实、肉质鲜美，这可是难得一见的好鱼饵，我强力推荐给你们几位先生。不过，我必须提醒一下，如果用手去抓或者用网拍去扑，那你怎么忙活，捉到的虫子也不够你一天钓鱼用的。那纯粹是愚蠢的举动，完全是浪费时间。我要再次提醒诸位先生，那样的捕捉法会得不偿失的。正确的方法是使用围网，或者使用拿普通蚊帐制成的网。要让我提建议（说不定我哪天真会提这种建议呢），我会说：上轻武器课时，应该向年轻军官传授这种技法。两个军官将网张开，对角拉紧，或者说一人扯一头吧，躬下腰，一手拽住网的下端，另一只手拽住网的上端，逆风跑起来。蚱蜢是顺风飞的，于是迎面撞在网上，这就被网住了。这样子，不费吹灰之力就能捕捉到一大堆蚱蜢。依我所见，所有的军官都应该随身带上一块蚊帐纱布，随时可以制成网捕捉蚱蜢。但愿我把话说清楚了，先生们。有问题吗？这门课如果有不懂之处，请尽管提问。把问题提出来好啦。没问题吗？那我就说几句结束语吧。我想引用伟大的战士和绅士亨利·威尔逊爵士的一句话：要么统治别人，要么被统治。请允许我再重复一遍。先生们，这一点我敦请诸位务必记住。离开此处之后，也务必牢记在心里：要么统治别人，要么被统治。我的话完了，先生们，再见！”

他把蒙着布罩的钢盔从头上拿下，然后再戴上，一弯腰从防空洞的矮门里走了出去。只见帕拉在那两个传令兵的陪同下正沿着洼地公路走过来。艳阳热如火炙，尼克摘下了钢盔。

“应该有套设备给这些东西浇点水。”他自言自语道，“我还是拿到河水里弄湿吧。”随后，他抬腿向河的堤岸上爬去。

“尼古拉！”帕拉维西尼喊道，“尼古拉！你这是到哪儿去？”

“其实我也没必要非得弄湿。”尼克又自言自语了一句，从坡上走了下来，手里拎着钢盔，“不管是湿的还是干的，戴在头上都是个累赘。你老戴着钢盔吗？”

“老戴着呢。”帕拉说，“把头都磨秃了。进去吧。”

进了防空洞，帕拉让他坐下。

“戴这东西屁用都不顶。”尼克说，“记得初次戴的时候，对心里到是一种安慰，后来却经常见戴着钢盔照样被打得脑袋开花。”

“尼古拉，”帕拉说道，“我认为你应该回国去。没有物资供应，最好别来前线。这里没有你做的事情。就算你有东西发给大家，四处乱走，引得大家聚在一起，会招来炮弹的。我可不愿发生这样的事情。”

“我也知道来此处并非明智之举。”尼克说，“这不是我的主意。听说旅部驻扎在此地，于是我就想来这儿能见到你或者别的什么熟人。我本来是可以去曾宗或圣多纳的。我很想重返圣多纳，再看看那座桥。”

“我是不想让你漫无目的地在这儿瞎转悠罢了。”帕拉维西尼上尉说。

“那好吧。”尼克支吾了一声。他觉得怒气又在从心头升起。

“这你理解不理解？”

“当然理解。”尼克说。他强忍住心里的怒气。

“这一类的活动应该在夜间进行。”

“自然喽。”尼克说道。他觉得自己已到了忍无可忍的地步。

“你知道，我指挥着一个营的人马。”帕拉说。

“这有什么呢？”尼克说着，怒从心头起，“你读得懂文件，写得了命令，这有什么难的呢？”

“不错。”帕拉温和地说。

“你的症结在于现在指挥了一个缩编的营。他们一旦恢复了元气，就会叫你回去继续当你的连长的。那些阵亡的人，为什么不掩埋呢？我都看见了，恐怕回过头还会看见。愿意什么时候埋就什么时候埋吧，反正也不关我的事，都是为了你们好。要不然，你们会染上瘟疫的。”

“你把自行车放在哪儿了？”

“在镇边一幢房屋的屋里。”

“放在那里不会有什么问题吧？”

“别担心，”尼克说，“我马上就走。”

“再躺一会儿吧，尼古拉。”

“好吧。”

他合上了眼睛。这次出现在眼前的不再是那个大胡子眯着眼用步枪的准星瞄准他，一脸镇静地时刻准备扣动扳机，而是一道白光闪过，像有一记闷棍砸在了他的膝盖上，一股火辣辣、甜丝丝的东西呛在喉咙里，呛得他一口吐在了石头上；与此同时，部队从身边开过，他看见了那幢狭长的黄房子、低矮的马棚和那条河面极其宽、水流异常平缓的大河。“基督呀，”他叫了一声，“我还是走了吧。”

他忽地站了起来。

“我该走了，帕拉。”他说，“我今天下午就骑车回去。如果有了物资，我就连夜送来。拿不到物资，我哪天夜里还是要来的，顺便带些礼品来。”

“现在走，天还是太热。”帕拉维西尼上尉说。

“你不必担心。”尼克说，“这工夫没事了。刚才有点难受，不过不太严重。现在好多了。我心里清楚，只要说话一多，就会出现这种情况。”

“我派个传令兵送送你。”

“我看就不必了。我认识路的。”

“你很快还要再来的吧？”

“一定的。”

“还是让我派个……”

“不必了。”尼克说，“算是信任我的一种表示吧。”

“好吧，那就再见了。”

“再见。”尼克说。然后，他迈步走上洼地公路，朝着放自行车的地方前行。过了运河，下午时分的公路上浓荫覆盖。再往前走，路两边绿树成行，丝毫没有受到炮弹的轰击。一次在那段公路上行军，与萨伏伊第三骑兵团擦肩而过，但见骑兵们踏雪飞驰，战马喷出的气在寒冷的空气中如缕缕白烟。错了，这恐怕是别的哪个地方的情景吧。究竟是哪个地方呢？

“算啦，我还是赶快去找回我的自行车吧。”尼克自言自语道，“可别迷了路，到不了福纳西了。”

向瑞士致敬


第一部

惠勒先生在蒙特勒留下的影像


车站咖啡店里温暖而明亮。木桌的桌面擦得铮亮，桌上的食品篮里放着椒盐卷饼，而卷饼装在抛光纸纸袋里。椅子是雕花的，虽旧却舒适。墙上有一个雕花木钟，吧台设在大堂的尽端。窗外雪花飘舞。

木钟下方的桌旁坐着两个车站的搬运工，正在喝新酿的酒。又有一个搬运工进来说辛普伦开来的东方快车在圣莫里斯晚点一个小时。他说完就出去了。咖啡店的女服务员听了，走到了惠勒先生的桌旁。

“列车晚点一个小时，先生，”她说，“给你来杯咖啡吧？”

“如果你觉得咖啡不会让我睡不着觉就可以。”

“来一杯好吗？”女服务员又问了一声。

“那就来一杯吧。”惠勒先生说。

“谢谢。”

服务员去厨房端来了一杯咖啡。惠勒先生眺望窗外，看着雪花在车站站台的灯光下漫天飞舞。

“除了英语，你还会说别的语言吗？”他问女服务员。

“哦，会的，先生。我还会说德语、法语和地方方言。”

“你想喝点什么吗？”

“哦，不了，先生。店里是不允许陪客人喝酒水的。”

“抽支雪茄怎么样？”

“哦，不抽了，先生。我不会抽烟，先生。”

“那好吧。”惠勒先生说。他又望了一眼窗外，喝口咖啡，点上了一根烟。

“小姐(1)！”他叫了一声。女服务员闻声走了过来。

“你需要什么，先生？”

“要你。”他说。

“你不该和我开这种玩笑。”

“不是开玩笑。”

“这种话你是不该说的。”

“我没时间绕弯子，”惠勒先生说，“火车四十分钟就进站了。如果你陪我上楼，我就给你一百法郎。”

“你不该说这种话，先生。我去叫那个搬运工过来跟你说话吧。”

“我不需要搬运工，”惠勒先生说，“不需要警察，也不需要卖香烟的杂役。我需要的是你。”

“再这样说话，就请你出去。不允许你留在这儿，说这样的话。”

“那你为什么不走开呀！你一走开，我就跟你说不成这种话了。”

女服务员转身走了。惠勒先生盯着她，看她是不是会去找搬运工。她没有去。

“小姐(2)！”他叫了一声。女服务员走了过来。“给我拿一瓶西昂酒来。”

“好的，先生。”

惠勒先生目送着她出去，看着她把酒拿来，走到了他的桌子跟前。这时，他望了一眼木钟。

“我会给你两百法郎的。”他说道。

“请你别说这种话。”

“两百法郎可是一大笔钱呀。”

“不许你说这种话！”女服务员说道。她的英语越说越蹩脚。惠勒先生饶有兴趣地打量着她。

“给你两百法郎。”

“你真讨厌。”

“那你为什么不走开？你不在跟前，我就不能和你说这种话了。”

女服务员走了，到吧台那儿去了。惠勒先生喝着酒，暗自笑了一阵子。

“小姐(3)！”他叫了一声。女服务员假装没听见。“小姐！(4)”他又叫了一声。女服务员走了过来。

“你想要什么？”

“要你，很想要。我给你三百法郎。”

“你真讨厌。”

“给你三百瑞士法郎。”

她转身走掉了。惠勒先生望着她的背影。一个搬运工推开了门，他是负责为惠勒先生拿行李的。

“火车来了，先生。”他用法语说道。惠勒先生站了起来。

“小姐(5)！”他叫了一声。女服务员走了过来。“酒钱是多少？”

“七法郎。”

惠勒先生数了八法郎，放在了桌子上，穿上外套，随搬运工走向站台——那儿大雪纷飞，满地琼花。

“再见，小姐。(6)”他说。

女服务员望着他离去，心想：“这人真坏，讨厌死啦。那种事本来就不花钱的，他偏要给三百法郎。我不知做了有多少次了，分文都不取的。店里是没有地方干那种事的。他要是有脑子，就该知道这儿没地方。竟要花三百法郎！这些美国人真是摆阔气。”

惠勒先生站在水泥站台上自己的行李旁，顺着铁轨望去，但见火车亮着大灯穿过风雪开进站来。他盘算着，觉得自己消费一场，真是划算得很，除了饭钱，实际上只花掉了一瓶七法郎的酒钱和一法郎的小费。要是给七十五生丁(7)的小费就更好了。当时要是给七十五生丁的小费，他现在的感觉会更好的。一个瑞士法郎值五个法国法郎呢。他现在要去的地方是巴黎。他在钱的方面精打细算，对女人毫无兴趣。这个车站他以前来过，知道咖啡店里并无“楼上”可去。有风险的事，他从来都不会做的。





第二部

约翰逊先生在沃韦吐露了心事


车站咖啡店里温暖而明亮。桌子擦得铮亮，有几张桌子上铺着红白格子桌布。所有的桌子上都有食品篮，篮里放着椒盐卷饼，而卷饼装在抛光纸纸袋里。椅子是雕花的，虽旧却舒适。墙上有一个挂钟，镀锌的吧台设在大堂的尽端。窗外雪花飘舞。挂钟下方的桌旁坐着两个车站的搬运工，正在喝新酿的酒。

又有一个搬运工进来说辛普伦开来的东方快车在圣莫里斯晚点一个小时。他说完就出去了。咖啡店的女服务员听了，走到了约翰逊先生的桌旁。

“列车晚点一个小时，先生，”她说，“给你来杯咖啡吧？”

“如果不太麻烦就行。”

“来一杯好吗？”女服务员又问了一声。

“那就来一杯吧。”

“谢谢。”

服务员去厨房端来了一杯咖啡。约翰逊先生眺望窗外，看着雪花在车站站台的灯光下漫天飞舞。

“除了英语，你还会说别的语言吗？”他问女服务员。

“哦，会的，先生。我还会说德语、法语和地方方言。”

“你想喝点什么吗？”

“哦，不了，先生。店里是不允许陪客人喝酒水的。”

“抽支雪茄怎么样？”

“哦，不，先生。”她哈哈一笑说，“我不会抽烟，先生。”

“我也不会抽，”约翰逊说，“抽烟是个坏毛病。”

可是女服务员一走，约翰逊就点了支烟，喝了口咖啡。墙上的挂钟是差一刻十点钟。他的表走得有点快。火车应该十点半抵达——晚点一个小时意味着十一点半抵达。

“小姐(8)！”

“你需要什么，先生？”

“你愿不愿陪我玩玩？”约翰逊问。女服务员飞红了脸。

“不，先生。”

“我不是指那种胡来的事情。你愿不愿做个伴，看一看沃韦的夜生活？如果愿意，可以带上你的闺蜜一起去。”

“我得工作呢，”女服务员说，“现在我当班。”

“这我知道。”约翰逊说，“你就不能找个人替班吗！内战时期，这种现象是常有的。”

“哦，不行，先生。我本人得亲自在这儿值班。”

“你的英语是在哪儿学的？”

“在贝立兹学校，先生。”

“讲给我听听。”约翰逊说，“贝立兹的学生是不是都很野？她们是不是喜欢搂脖子亲嘴？是不是那儿有许多讨女人欢心的家伙？你碰见过斯科特·菲茨杰拉德(9)没有？”

“请问你说什么来着？”

“我是说大学的那些日子是你一生中最幸福的时光了吧？去年秋天有什么球队到贝立兹去过吧？”

“你是在开玩笑吧，先生？”

“只是个小小的玩笑罢了。”约翰逊说，“你是个相当不错的女孩子。你不愿陪我玩吗？”

“哦，不行，先生。”女服务员说，“想让我给你拿点什么吗？”

“好吧。”约翰逊说，“能把酒单拿给我吗？”

“好的，先生。”

约翰逊拿上酒单，朝着三个搬运工坐的那张桌子走去。那几个都是老人，抬头望着他。

“你们想喝酒吗？(10)”他问道。其中的一个搬运工点了点头，微微一笑。

“是的，先生。(11)”

“你会说法语？”

“是的，先生(12)。”

“喝什么好呢？你懂得香槟酒吗？(13)”

“不懂，先生。(14)”

“她应该是懂的(15)。”约翰逊说。“小姐(16)，”他高声叫那位女服务员道，“我们要喝香槟酒。”

“喝哪种香槟，先生？”

“喝最好的。”约翰逊说。“哪一种最好呢？(17)”他问那几个搬运工。

“最好的吗？(18)”最先开口说话的那个搬运工问。

“没错。”

那个搬运工从外套口袋里取出一副金丝边眼镜，扫了一眼酒单。他的手指顺着那四个打印出来的酒名和价格上划过。

“运动员牌的吧，”他说，“运动员牌的最好。”

“你们同意吗，先生们？”约翰逊问另两位搬运工道。一个搬运工点了点头，还有一个用法语说：“我没喝过这些酒，不过我倒是常听人说过起运动员牌香槟。这是好酒。”

“来一瓶运动员牌香槟。”约翰逊对女服务员说。他看了看酒单上的价格——十一个瑞士法郎一瓶。“来两瓶吧。”随后，他问那个建议选运动员牌香槟的搬运工道：“我和你们坐在一起，你不介意吧？”

“请坐，快请坐。”那个搬运工冲他微微一笑说，然后将眼镜折起，放进眼镜盒里，“今天是先生的生日吧？”

“不是，”约翰逊说，“不是庆祝生日。我妻子决定要和我离婚了。”

“遗憾，”那个搬运工说，“希望别离。”

另两个搬运工，一个听了直摇头，还有一个似乎有点耳聋。

“毫无疑问，这是个很寻常的事情，”约翰逊说，“就跟第一次去看牙科医生，或者女孩子家第一次来例假一样。不过，我还是感到很纠结的。”

“可以理解。”年龄最大的那个搬运工说，“我理解你的心情。”

“你们几位先生没人离过婚吧？”约翰逊问。此刻，他的法语已不再打绊了，变得纯正了起来。这种纯正的法语他说了好一会儿。

“没人离过。”那个点运动员牌香槟酒的搬运工说，“这里的人不太离婚。离了婚的男人倒是有一些，但是不多。”

“我们那儿就不一样了，”约翰逊说，“实际上人人离婚。”

“那倒也是。”那个搬运工证实道，“我在报上看到过。”

“我离婚都算晚的了。”约翰逊继续说道，“我今年三十五岁。这是我第一次离婚。”

“你还年轻。(19)”那个搬运工说道。随后，他又对另两位搬运工解释说：“先生只有三十五岁。(20)”那两个点了点头。其中的一个说：“他的确很年轻。”

“你真的是第一次离婚？”那个搬运工问。

“确确实实。”约翰逊说，“请把酒打开吧，小姐。”

“离婚很费钱吧？”

“得一万法郎。”

“瑞士法郎吗？”

“不。是法国法郎。”

“哦，是这样的。那就是两千瑞士法郎。不管怎样，反正是不便宜。”

“是的。”

“那么，为什么要离婚呢？”

“是对方提出来的。”

“为什么提呢？”

“是为了另嫁新欢呗。”

“真是愚蠢之举。”

“英雄所见略同。”约翰逊说。女服务员为他们四个斟满了酒。大家一起举杯在手。

“干杯！”约翰逊说。

“为你的健康干杯，先生。(21)”那个搬运工说。另两个搬运工说：“为你干杯！(22)”香槟酒入口，味道就像那种粉红色的甜苹果汁。

“瑞士是不是有一种约定俗成的规矩：答话时用另一种语言？”

“没有。”那个搬运工说，“法语比较高雅罢了。再说，此处是瑞士的法语区。”

“可是，你说德语？”

“是的。我们那地方都说德语。”

“明白了。”约翰逊说，“你说你从没有离过婚？”

“是的。离婚太费钱。再说，我从没有结过婚。”

“哦。”约翰逊说了一声，“另外两位先生呢？”

“他们是结了婚的。”

“你喜欢结婚吗？”约翰逊问其中一个结了婚的搬运工。

“什么？”

“你喜欢这种婚姻状态吗？”

“喜欢。这是正常的状态。(23)”

“一点不错。”约翰逊说，“而你呢，先生？(24)”

“这很好。(25)”另一个搬运工说。

“对我来说(26)，”约翰逊说，“可就不好了(27)。”

“先生马上就要离婚了呀。”头一个搬运工说了这么一句。

“是呀。”第二个搬运工说。

“是啊。”第三个搬运工随声附和地说。

“好啦，”约翰逊说，“这个话题似乎没什么再说的了。你对我遇到的麻烦并不感兴趣。”他的后半句话是冲着第一个搬运工说的。

“可是……是这样的。”那个搬运工说。

“好吧，那就换个话题吧。”

“听你的。”

“说什么好来着？”

“你喜欢体育运动吗？”

“不喜欢。”约翰逊说，“我妻子倒是挺喜欢的。”

“那么，你都喜欢干什么？”

“我是个作家。”

“当作家能挣很多钱吗？”

“不能。不过，你出了名，挣的钱就多了。”

“有意思。”

“没意思，”约翰逊说，“没什么意思。对不起，先生们，我得告辞了。另一瓶酒你们也喝了吧，好吗？”

“可是，火车来还有三刻钟呢。”

“这我知道。”约翰逊说。女服务员过来，他付了酒钱和饭钱。

“你要出去，先生？”女服务员问。

“是的，”约翰逊说，“出去走走。我把行李留在这儿。”

说完，他围上围巾，穿上外套，戴上帽子。外边正飘着鹅毛大雪。他回头望望，透过窗户他看见那三个搬运工仍坐在桌旁。女服务员拿着那瓶打开了的酒，将剩下的酒倒进他们的杯子。然后，她把没开瓶的酒送回了吧台。约翰逊心想：这下子，他们几个每人可捞三个法郎。他一转身，沿着站台走开了。在咖啡店里。他原以为说说心事可以让它冲淡些，谁料心事并没有冲淡，却觉得心里堵得慌。





第三部

一个会员的儿子在泰里特


泰里特的车站咖啡店里暖洋洋的，简直有点太暖和了；店里灯火辉煌，桌子擦得亮光闪闪。桌子上摆着食品篮，篮里放着椒盐卷饼，而卷饼装在抛光纸纸袋里。另外，桌上还有一些硬纸板的啤酒杯垫，以防湿杯子在木头桌面上留下水印。木头椅子是雕花的，虽旧却相当舒适。墙上有一个挂钟，吧台设在大堂的尽端。窗外雪花飘舞。一位老者坐在挂钟下方的一张桌子旁边喝咖啡边看晚报。一个搬运工进来说辛普伦开来的东方快车在圣莫里斯晚点一个小时。咖啡店的女服务员走到了哈里斯先生的桌旁。哈里斯先生刚刚吃完了晚餐。

“列车晚点一个小时，先生。给你来杯咖啡吧？”

“如果你乐意的话。”

“来一杯好吗？”女服务员又问了一声。

“那就来一杯吧。”哈里斯先生说。

“谢谢，先生。”女服务员说。

她去厨房端来了一杯咖啡。哈里斯先生加了糖，用汤匙把糖块捣来捣去，捣得嘎吱响，一边眺望窗外，看着雪花在车站站台的灯光下漫天飞舞。

“除了英语，你还会说别的语言吗？”他问女服务员。

“哦，会的，先生。我还会说德语、法语和地方方言。”

“你最喜欢的是哪一种？”

“都差不多吧，先生。我也说不准自己偏爱那一种。”

“你想喝点酒或咖啡什么的吗？”

“哦，不了，先生。店里是不允许陪客人喝酒水的。”

“抽支雪茄怎么样？”

“哦，不，先生。”她哈哈一笑说，“我不会抽烟，先生。”

“我也不会抽，”约翰逊说，“对于大卫·贝拉斯科(28)的观点我是不赞成的。”

“请问你说谁来着？”

“贝拉斯科。大卫·贝拉斯科。他的尊容叫你一见就能认出来，因为他老把衣领倒着穿。对于他的观点，我不敢苟同。话又说回来，他已离别了阳世。”

“对不起，先生，我能走了吗？”女服务员问。

“当然可以。”哈里斯说。他坐在椅子上，身子前倾，眼睛望了望窗外。大堂那一端坐着的老者此时将报纸一折，看看哈里斯先生，端起咖啡杯和杯碟，来到了哈里斯的桌前。

“请原谅，打搅了。”他用英语说道，“我刚才想了想，觉得你可能是美国国家地理学会的会员。”

“你请坐。”哈里斯说。老者坐了下来。

“再喝杯咖啡或者酒吧？”

“谢谢。”老者说。

“陪我喝杯樱桃酒吧？”

“也好。不过，还是我请吧。”

“不行，我是要请的。”哈里斯说完，喊了一声女服务员。

老者从外套口袋里掏出一个皮夹子，将捆在外边的一条宽宽的皮筋取掉，抽出几片纸，从中选了个纸片递给哈里斯。

“这是我的会员证。”他说，“你认识美国的弗雷德里克·杰·罗素吧？”

“恐怕不认识。”

“我认为他是个非常杰出的人物。”

“他是哪里的？是美国哪个地区的？”

“当然是华盛顿的了。学会的总部不就设在那儿吗？”

“我想是的。”

“你想是的？你拿不准吗？”

“我出国的时间久了。”哈里斯说。

“你不是他们的会员吗？”

“不是。我父亲是的。他是多年的老会员了。”

“那他应该认识弗雷德里克·杰·罗素的。罗素先生是学会的一个理事。你会注意到，我是经他提名才成为会员的。”

“真为你感到高兴。”

“可惜你不是个会员。不过，你能不能经你父亲提名加入？”

“我想是可以的。”哈里斯说，“我一回去就办理此事。”

“我建议你一定办理。”老者说，“你肯定见过学会的杂志(29)吧？”

“当然喽。”

“带彩色插图的关于北美动物志的那一期你看了吧？”

“看了，是在巴黎看的。”

“还有刊登了阿拉斯加火山全景的那一期呢？”

“那可真是一种奇观。”

“我还非常喜欢乔治·西拉斯第三拍摄的那些野生动物照片。”

“简直是美轮美奂。”

“对不起，你说什么来着？”

“那些照片很精彩。西拉斯那家伙……”

“你怎么叫他‘家伙’呢？”

“我们是老朋友。”

“原来如此。原来你认识乔治·西拉斯第三。他一定是个十分风趣的人物。”

“的确如此。他恐怕是我所认识的最为风趣的人了。”

“你认识乔治·西拉斯第二吗？他也很风趣吧？”

“哦，他不太风趣。”

“我还想着他也是个非常风趣的人物呢。”

“说来也怪，他并非一个十分风趣的人。为此，我心里常常感到纳闷。”

“原来是这样，”老者说，“我还以为那家里的人个个都很风趣呢。”

“撒哈拉沙漠的那幅照片你还记得吗？”哈里斯问。

“撒哈拉沙漠？那一期差不多是十五年前的。”

“对。那一期最受家父的青睐。”

“他不喜欢比较新一些的照片？”

“也许喜欢吧。但他尤其喜欢那幅撒哈拉的全景照。”

“好极了。不过，我觉得照片的艺术价值要远远超过它的科学趣味。”

“这我说不清。”哈里斯说，“我只记得照片上狂风卷起漫天黄沙，一个阿拉伯人和他的骆驼跪在地上，面朝麦加方向。”

“根据我的记忆，阿拉伯人是站着的，手里牵着骆驼。”

“你说得一点不错。”哈里斯说，“我刚才心里在想着劳伦斯上校(30)的那本书来着。”

“我相信，劳伦斯的那本书讲的是阿拉伯的事情。”

“一点不错。”哈里斯说，“正因为讲的是阿拉伯的事情，才勾起了我对那幅照片的回忆。”

“他一定是个非常风趣的年轻人。”

“我相信他一定是的。”

“你知道他现在在干什么吗？”

“在皇家空军服役呢。”

“他为什么要加入空军呢？”

“他喜欢呗。”

“据你所知，他是不是美国国家地理学会的人？”

“这我也说不清。”

“他要是加入，一定能成为出类拔萃的成员。学会需要的就是这样的人。如果你觉得学会有意吸收他，我将非常乐意为他提名。”

“我觉得他们会愿意吸收的。”

“我曾为沃韦的一个科学家提名，还为洛桑我的一个同事提名，结果两人都当选了。我相信，我要是为劳伦斯上校提名，学会一定会非常满意的。”

“这是个很好的主意。”哈里斯说，“你常来这家店里喝咖啡吗？”

“饭后就来此处喝上一杯。”

“你在大学里教书？”

“不再执教了。”

“我是等火车的，”哈里斯说，“要到巴黎去，然后乘船从勒阿弗尔前往美国。”

“我没去过美国。不过，我非常想去上一趟。也许，有朝一日我会去参加学会的会议的。见到令尊大人，我会非常高兴的。”

“我敢肯定，他也一定很高兴见到你。不过，他于去年过世了，是开枪自杀的。说来也真够怪的。”

“对此我感到非常难过。我敢说，他的离世无论是对科学界还是他的家庭都是沉重的打击。”

“科学界很轻松地接受了这一现实。”

“这是我的名片。”哈里斯说，“我的名字缩写用E. D.，而家父的缩写是E. J.。他要是在世，一定会很高兴认识你的。”

“那将会是我莫大的荣幸。”老者说着从皮夹里取出一张名片递给哈里斯。名片上写着：

美利坚合众国华盛顿特区

美国国家地理学会会员

西格斯蒙德·维亚尔（哲学博士）

“我一定精心保存。”哈里斯说。

等死日


我们还躺在床上的时候，他走进屋里来关窗户。我看了看，见他一脸病容。他浑身哆嗦，面色苍白如纸，步态缓慢，仿佛动一动就会感到疼痛。

“你怎么啦，莎兹？”

“我头疼。”

“你最好回到床上去。”

“不。我没事的。”

“快回到床上去。我把衣服穿好去看你。”

可是，等我下了楼，却见他已穿上了衣服坐在炉火旁，显得病怏怏的，脸上带着九岁小男孩患病时的那种可怜相。我摸摸他的额头，发现他在发烧。

“快到床上去，”我说，“你生病了。”

“我没事的。”他说。

医生赶来，给孩子量了体温。

“多少度？”我问医生。

“一百零二度(1)。”

到了楼下，医生留下三种药——三种不同颜色的药丸，并交代了服用方法。这三种药，一种是退烧的，一种是泻药，还有一种是控制酸性环境的。据他解释，流感病菌只能存活在酸性环境里。他对流感似乎无所不知，说体温只要不超过一百零四度就不用担心。他说这是轻度流感，不出现肺炎并发症便无危险。

送走医生，我回到屋里，用笔将孩子的体温记下来，还分别记下了服各种药丸的时间。

“想让我给你念书听吗？”

“你愿意念，那我就听吧。”孩子说。他脸色煞白煞白，眼睛下方出现了黑圈，静静躺在床上，一副超然的样子，好像自身与周围的环境无关似的。

我大声为他读霍华德·派尔(2)写的《海盗集》，可是却发现他没有用心去听。

“你感觉怎么样了，莎兹？”我问他。

“截至目前，还是那个样。”他说。

我坐在床脚跟前，一边自管自地看书，一边等着时间一到就给他再服另一种药。按说，他也应该睡着了，可是我抬头却见他在盯着床脚看，神情很是异常。

“你为什么不睡一会儿呢？吃药时我会叫醒你的。”

“我愿意这样醒着。”

过了一会儿，他又对我说：“爸爸，你心烦，就不用在这儿陪我了。”

“我不烦。”

“不，我是说，假如这令你心烦的话，就不用陪了。”

我想着他也许有点头晕了，于是在十一点钟给他吃了医生开的药丸，就出去了一会儿。

天气晴冷，地面上的雨雪结成了冰，就好像所有光秃秃的树、灌木丛、修剪过的灌木篱、草坪以及空地都消失在了冰的世界里。我带着那条爱尔兰小猎犬溜达，沿着一条结冰的小溪在路上走着。路面光滑如镜，无论是走还是停都成了难事。红毛小猎犬滑倒了几次，我也两次滑倒，摔得很重，有一次猎枪都掉在了地上，在冰面上出溜到了老远的地方。

高高的土堤跟前的灌木丛里有一群鹌鹑被我们惊起，就在它们飞到土堤的上方，眼看就要消失时，我开枪打死了两只。有些鹌鹑躲在树上，而大多数则零零散散匿身于灌木丛中，得在结了冰层的灌木覆盖的土堤上蹦几蹦，弄出很大响动才会把它们惊起。而我走进结着冰凌、富有弹性的灌木时，它们却飞了出来。由于脚下不稳，得努力保持平衡，给射击增加了难度。我打死了两只，有五只没有射中。竟然有鹌鹑群离家门近在咫尺！这叫我在归家的路上心里有了几分喜悦，心想哪一天去打猎还会发现许多呢。

回到家，屋里的人说那孩子不允许任何人进他的房间。

“你们不能进来，”那孩子是这样说的，“不许你们把我的东西拿走！”

我二话没说，上楼去见他，发现他跟我离开他时一个样，还是那种姿势，脸白如纸，只是脸蛋由于发烧而红通通的，两眼发直，直呆呆望着床脚。

我给他测了体温。

“多少度？”

“像是一百度吧。”我说，其实是一百零二度四分。

“是一百零二度。”他说。

“谁说的？”

“医生说的。”

“你的体温没问题，”我说，“没什么可担心的。”

“我不是担心，”他说，“只是由不得想想罢了。”

“别胡思乱想，”我说，“心情放松些。”

“我的心情是放松的。”他说着话，眼睛直视前方，显然心里隐藏着不便说出的心事。

“你用水把这药咽下去。”

“你觉得这药顶用吗？”

“当然顶用。”

我坐下来，打开那本《海盗集》，开始念给他听，后来发现他没有在听，于是也就不念了。

“你看我何时会死呢？”他问。

“你说什么？”

“我还能活多长时间？”

“你不会死的。你这是怎么啦？”

“哦，会的，我会死的。我听医生说我的体温是一百零二度。”

“一百零二度是死不了人的。你说这话是冒傻气。”

“我知道会死人的。在法国上学的时候，同学们说体温到了四十四度就活不了了。而我都一百零二度了。”

原来他从早晨九点开始，一直在等死，等了一整天。

“莎兹呀，你这个小可怜，”我说道，“可怜的小莎兹呀。测体温的换算是不一样的，犹如英里和公里之比。你不会死的。那是两种不同的温度计。按法国的温度计，三十七度属于正常。而这儿的温度计，正常的体温是九十八度。”

“你敢肯定？”

“百分之百肯定。”我说，“测体温的换算是不一样的，犹如英里和公里之比。你知道咱们开车的时速为七十英里，等于多少公里吗？”

“这个嘛……”他支吾了一声。

不过，他那紧盯着床脚的目光渐渐缓和了，心里紧绷着的弦也终于放松了。到了第二天，他的紧张情绪完全消失了，为了一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事就乱哭乱叫的。

关于亡者的博物学研究


我一直觉得博物学家忽略了战争，没有将它作为观察的领域。已故的威·亨·哈德森(1)针对巴塔哥尼亚(2)的植物群和动物群有过陈述，引人入胜、精彩纷呈；吉尔伯特·怀特(3)牧师描写过戴胜鸟如何光顾塞耳彭村(4)，偶尔飞临，却意义非凡，写得真是妙趣横生；斯坦利主教撰写了《鸟类的历史》，通俗易懂、弥足珍贵。难道我们就不能心怀希望，给读者提供一些有关亡者的合情合理、生动有趣的事实吗？希望能够做到这一点。

那位百折不挠的旅行家芒戈·派克(5)曾经在广袤无垠的非洲沙漠遭困，一度昏厥，浑身一丝不挂，孤独身处绝地，想来大限将到，无出路可寻，只好躺下等死。就在这时，一朵异常美的小青苔花吸引住了他的目光。他过后回忆说：“那朵花整个儿还没有我的一根手指粗，可是看到它的根茎、叶片和花荚构造得那般精美，由不得心生赞叹。在这个无人注意的区域，上帝种植、浇灌了这么一个看上去微不足道的小东西，并使之完美，难道他会对一个按照自己的形象创造的生灵所面临的处境和困苦置若罔闻吗？绝对不会的。这样的念头是不会允许我甘于绝望的。于是我跳起身，不顾饥饿和劳累，继续向前走去，坚信出路就在眼前。结果我没有失望。”

如斯坦利主教所言，有这种欣赏和赞叹之心，无论从事任何领域的博物学研究，势必会增添研究者的信念、热情和希望。那么，我们在穿过人生的荒漠时，我们当中的每一位是不是也都需要有同样的信念、热情和希望呢？我们不妨先研究一下亡者吧，看从中能获取什么样的灵感。

战场上的亡者，就人类而言通常是男性，但对畜类便言之不实了。雌性战马战死沙场是司空见惯的事。战争另有非常有趣的一面——只有在战场上博物学家才有观察死骡子的机会。在平常的生活中，我观察了二十年都没有见过一只死骡子，于是开始产生了怀疑，觉得骡子都是不死之身。有那么一两次，我以为自己看到了死骡子，可是走近细瞧，结果每一次都发现那是活骡子，只是睡得太死了，才看上去像死了一样。可是在战争中，这种动物跟寻寻常常、不那么吃苦耐劳的战马同样会捐躯疆场。

我在战场上见到过的死骡子大都出现在山路上或者横尸于陡峭的斜坡脚下——那是人们害怕死骡子挡道，把它们推下去的。在大山里，死骡子是常见的，这种现象似乎倒也挺合适的，可后来我在士麦那所见就不那么协调了——在士麦那，希腊人把辎重牲口的腿全都打断，再将它们从码头推下浅水里活活淹死。众多骡子和马被打断腿，淹死在浅水里，这场面真是值得戈雅(6)一画。不过，严格地说，戈雅恐怕是叫不来了，因为世界上只有一个戈雅，他早已是作古之人，再说，这些牲口如果会说话，它们愿意不愿意叫人用画面表现它们的惨景，得打一个大大的问号。话又说回来，牲口们假如能用语言表达，它们很可能会寻求帮助减轻它们的痛苦。

关于亡者性别的问题，我们习惯看见亡者皆为男性，此乃不争的事实，见到一个亡故的女性，一定会觉得触目惊心。我第一次看见亡者性别颠倒的现象是在一个军工厂爆炸之后——那家军工厂位于意大利米兰城附近的乡下。我们乘坐卡车赶往出事现场，一路白杨树浓荫如盖，路边的水沟里有无数微小的生物，只可惜卡车扬起漫天的尘土，让我无法观察得清。到了军工厂所在之处，我们当中的一些人奉命巡逻，围着大堆不知何故没有爆炸的军火查看，另一些人则被分派去灭火（此时火势已蔓延至临近的荒草地里）。这些任务完成之后，我们又奉命在军工厂跟前以及周围的田野里寻找尸体，找到后就抬往临时停尸房（死的人真不少）。说实话，看见死者多为女性，男性较少，我心里吃惊不小。当时的女性还没有开始留齐耳短发，欧美大陆女性留短发是以后几年的事情了。看见长发亡者让人感到极为不安，也许是因为极不习惯的缘故吧，而不留长发的亡者只是偶尔一现，就更叫人心里翻腾不息了。记得我们彻底搜寻完了全尸，又着手找残骸。许多残尸碎片都是从工厂四周密密麻麻的铁丝网上取下来的，还有一些是从存留下来的厂房里找到的。我们寻来的残骸堆积如山，充分地说明了当时爆炸的威力十分巨大。许多残骸是在老远的野地里发现的，它们是被爆炸的气浪抛到那儿去的。

返回米兰的途中，记得有一两个人讨论起了这次事故，一致认为此次事故在性质上有些不现实，还说现场未发现伤员。这就大大降低了恐怖色彩，否则要可怕得多呢。还有一点：爆炸发生得过于直接，结果搬运尸体和处理尸体就不那么让人感到不舒服了，这与通常战场上的经历天差地别。卡车行驶在风景秀丽的伦巴第乡下，虽尘土飞扬，却也赏心悦目，算是对这次窝心的差事一种补偿吧。归途中，我们交换了看法，一致认为突发的大火在我们赶到之前就迅速地得到了控制，没有让大火殃及那些看上去堆积如山的尚未爆炸的军火，实在是天大的幸事。我们还认为收集残骸是件非同寻常的差事。令人诧异的是，按说人体应该分结构被炸得一块一块的，可是在强力炸药爆炸的威力下，却被炸得血肉横飞，随着弹片飞向四方。

为了实现观察的精确性，博物学家应该将目光聚焦在某一特定的时期。我首选奥地利军队在意大利发动攻势之后的一九一八年六月作为特定的时期。当时，亡者人数众多。意大利军队先是被迫撤退，后又反攻收复失地。一场拉锯战之后，阵地依旧，亡者却变了样。在下葬之前，死人每天都多少有些变样。白种人死后，面色由白变黄，再转为黄绿色，最后发黑。死尸在高温下放得太久，尸体上的肉就变得像煤焦油一样（尤其是伤损部分），而且还明显带有焦油的那种亮色。亡者会逐日膨胀，有时膨胀得让军装都包不住了，鼓胀胀的，好像马上会爆炸开似的。亡者的腰身会变粗，粗到令人无法相信的程度，面皮绷紧，肿胀得像气球。除了死尸发胀，还有一种现象也叫人惊讶——亡者身旁乱扔着许多纸片。涉及安葬的问题，亡者的姿势要根据他军装上口袋的位置而定。奥地利的军装，军裤的口袋开在屁股后边，要不了多久，亡者便会被折腾得面朝地，两个屁股口袋被掏空，装在口袋里的各种证件被掏出来，散落在荒草中。高温，苍蝇，荒草中尸体横七竖八，纸片满世界都是，这些就是给人留下的印象。大热天战场上的气味是让人回忆不起来的。你就是记得住那种气味，却再无同样的遭遇令你想得起它。这跟军队里的气味是不一样的。你在乘坐电车时，也许会突然想起军队的气味，于是你看看对面的一位军人，发现原来是他使你想起来的。而战场的气味消失了，荡然无存了，就像你热恋，过后记得起发生的事情，却记不清那澎湃的激情了。

在这么个天气热烘烘的战场上，真不知那位百折不挠的旅行家芒戈·派克看到什么样的景象才会重拾信心。六月底和七月份，麦地里总会出现罂粟花，桑树长得枝繁叶茂，阳光透过绿叶伪装网照在炮筒上，看得见炮筒上升起一股股热浪；芥子毒气弹炸出一个个弹坑，弹坑边缘的土变得黄灿灿的，破屋烂房固然不美观，但是比遭炮击的房屋好看。不过，旅行家身临此地，深深呼吸一口这初夏的空气，可能不会产生芒戈·派克那样的想法，想到上帝按照自己的形象创造生灵什么的。

你看见亡者，第一感觉就是，他们死得好惨，像畜生一样送了命。有的受了点小伤即刻毙命——你恐怕会觉得连兔子受那点伤也不会死的。他们死于小伤，就像兔子有时中了两三颗似乎连皮毛都伤不了的霰弹碎粒而丧命一样。还有一些死状如猫一般——脑壳被击中，铁片嵌入脑浆，像猫一样躺在那儿躺上两天都不死（凡猫者，脑浆里有了子弹，会爬进煤箱躲起来，得用刀将它们的头剁掉才会一命呜呼）。即便如此，它们也不会呜呼的，都说它们有九条命嘛。这我就不清楚了，我只知道大多数亡者死状像畜生，而非人。所谓的自然死亡，我一个都没有看见过。要怪就得怪战争。我像那位百折不挠的旅行家芒戈·派克一样不甘心，知道会有新的情况出现的，柳暗的时候总会出现花明。这种状况总算被我看到了。

那是我所见过的唯一一个自然死亡的例子了，失血并不严重，是死于西班牙流感。患此病者浑身大汗淋漓、气短，死状如下：临终时虽有成年人的气力，却呈幼童状，小便浸湿床单，似幼童便溺于尿布，过世之后床上仍见大量黄色液体流淌、滴落。我倒想看看自称为人道主义者的人是怎么死的。芒戈·派克那样的百折不挠的旅行家，或者我，就是要活下来看看以后的情况，也许真能活到那一天，看到那些文学流派的成员是怎么死的，看看他们高贵的结局。作为一个博物学家，我在思考问题时曾想到过，讲究体统固然是美德，但人类要繁衍下去，必然会有不成体统的现象，因为传宗接代的那种姿势就不成体统，十分不成体统。我心想，这些人也许就是（或者曾经是）出生于高雅共居的子女。不过，暂且不管这一小撮人是如何诞生的，我倒是希望能看到他们的结局，看看寄生虫们是怎样解决那个长期悬而未决的不育问题。他们那离奇的宣传手册已变为废纸，他们关于肉欲的理论也付之东流。

也许，在针对亡者从事博物学研究时，评论几句这些自封的“公民”是合理合法的，即便在本文发表时此封号无任何意义可言，但是这样评论在大热天里看到的那些嘴里嘴外有半品脱蛆虫在乱爬的亡者便有失公道了，他们年纪轻轻就死去，而且并非出于自愿，他们又不经办杂志，许多人肯定连篇评论都没有看过。亡者并非总是出现于大热天，很多时候都是出现于雨天——雨水会把雨地里的他们冲洗干净，也会将掩埋他们的土壤化软，有时大雨下个不停，会将土壤化为泥浆，把亡者从坟坑里冲出来，此时就得再次掩埋。还有的人亡于冬天，亡于群山之间，草草用积雪掩埋，春天雪融，自会有人看到后给他们下葬。大山里的下葬地风景优美，群山间的战争是最美丽的战争。有位将军头部被一个狙击手打穿，埋在了一个叫波科尔的地方。作家们写过这方面的书，书名叫《将军死于床上》，显然是搞错了，因为这位将军死于雪地里的战壕中，身处高山之上，头戴登山帽，帽子上插一根鹰翎，脑门前弹孔小，连小拇指都塞不进去，脑袋后的弹孔大，拳头都能塞得进去（如果你拳头小，并且想塞进去的话），雪地上血迹斑斑。他是一个杰出的将军。冯·贝尔也是一位出类拔萃的将军，此人指挥巴伐利亚阿尔卑斯军团参加卡波雷托战役，身先士卒地乘坐他的指挥车冲进乌迪内城中时，叫意军的后卫部队给打死了。如果追求精确性，写这类书，书名应该用《将军通常死于床上》。

在群山里，急救站设在隐蔽处，有大山挡着，炮弹打不到那儿去。急救站的外边，有时停放着亡者，雪花纷纷扬扬落在他们身上。他们都被抬进了一个坑里——那个坑是大地冰冻之前提前挖好的。在这个坑里有个伤员，脑壳被弹片打碎了，情状就跟碎了的花瓶一样。他的头被用薄膜包裹起来，而且技术含量很高地扎了绷带（绷带凝着血块，都变硬了），脑组织里却有一块碎钢片没取出来。他躺在那里挺过了一天一夜，接着又是一天。担架员请求医生进坑里去瞧瞧他。他们每次抬死人过来都看见他躺在那里，甚至不用把眼睛转过去瞧他都可以听见他的呼吸声。医生眼睛通红，眼皮肿胀，被催泪瓦斯熏得都快睁不开了。他来看过这个伤员两次，一次是在白天，一次是夜间打手电看的。这情景真可以同样成为戈雅很好的绘画素材——我是说打手电看望伤员的场面。医生在第二次查看之后，才相信了担架员的话，相信这位伤员还活着。

“你们想让我怎么处理？”他问道。

担架员也说不出个所以然来。可过了一会儿，他们提出要把这个伤员抬出去，跟那些重伤员放在一起。

“不，这可不行！”忙得不可开交的医生说，“怎么回事？难道你们还怕他不成？”

“我们不愿听他喘着气躺在死人堆里。”

“那就别听呀。如果你们把他抬出这个坑，很快还会把他抬回去的。”

“这我们不在乎，上尉医生。”

“不行！”医生说，“我说不行就不行。难道你们没听见我的话吗？”

“何不加大剂量，给他注射吗啡呢？”一位胳膊负伤，在一旁等待包扎的炮兵军官建议道。

“你以为我的吗啡没别的用处，只用在这里吗？做手术时不用吗啡，这你愿意吗？你手里有枪，干脆出去给他一枪不就得了。”

“他已经中过弹了。”军官说，“要是中弹的是你们医生，你的态度就不一样了。”

“亏你说得出来。”医生在空中挥舞着手术钳说，“对你的话，我得千恩万谢了。你看看这眼睛是怎么啦？”他用手术钳指了指自己的眼睛说，“你觉得怎么样呢？”

“那是催泪瓦斯弹熏的。中的是催泪瓦斯弹，我们称之为幸事。”

“你离开了火线，”医生说，“离开火线跑到这里来，声称要清除眼里的瓦斯。你那是把葱头揉进眼里罢了。”

“你发疯了。这是对我的侮辱，我可不跟你一般见识。简直疯疯癫癫的。”

两人说话间，担架员走了进来。

“上尉医生。”其中的一个担架员启口说道。

“快出去！”医生说。

几个担架员出去了。

“我一枪结果了那个可怜人算啦。”炮兵军官说，“我是个讲人道的人，不愿让他活受罪。”

“那就开枪好啦。”医生说，“去开枪打死他。责任由你承担。我写份报告，就说一位伤员在急救站被炮兵中尉开枪打死了。去呀，去打死他呀！”

“你说的这就不是人话。”

“我的职责是救死扶伤，而非要人性命。杀人则是炮兵队的老爷们干的事。”

“那你为什么不救救他呢？”

“我救了。能做的我都做了。”

“你为什么不用缆车把他送下山去？”

“你算老几，竟敢责问我？你是我的上司吗？这个急救站归你指挥吗？请你回答我！”

炮兵中尉无言以对。屋里其他的人都是士兵，没有别的军官在场。

“请你回答我的话。”医生边说边用手术钳夹起一个针头，“请你回答我的问题。”

“操你！”炮兵军官骂了一声。

“好吧，”医生说，“这可是你说的。算你厉害。算你厉害。咱们走着瞧。”

炮兵上尉霍地站起，朝他走了过来。

“操你！”他口里骂着，“操你！操你妈！操你妹！”

医生端起满满一盘子碘酒朝他脸上泼了过去。中尉一时眼睛看不见了，却仍向他走来，一边去掏手枪。医生快步蹿到他身后将他绊倒，狠狠踹了他几脚，然后用戴着橡皮手套的手捡起了那把枪。中尉坐在地上，用没受伤的那只手捂住眼睛。

“我要杀了你！”他说，“眼睛一能看见，我就杀了你。”

“我是头儿，”医生说，“你要是承认我是头儿，一切都可以搁过不提。你是杀不了我的，因为你的枪在我的手里。中士！副官！副官！”

“副官去缆车那儿了。”中士说。

“用酒精和水给这位军官清洗一下眼睛，他的眼睛里进了碘酒。把盆子端过来让我洗手。我下一个就给这位军官治伤。”

“不许你碰我。”

“抓紧他。他的脑子有点糊涂了。”

这时，一个担架员走了进来。

“上尉医生。”

“怎么啦？”

“死人坑的那个人……”

“你给我出去！”

“他死了，上尉医生。我以为你听了会很高兴的。”

“听见了吧，可怜的中尉？咱俩争来争去，全都白争了。在战争中，争什么都是白争。”

“操你！”炮兵中尉骂了一句。他的眼睛仍然看不见东西。“你把我的眼弄瞎了。”

“没事的，”医生说，“你的眼会没事的。没事的。一场毫无意义的争论。”

“哎哟！哎哟！哎哟！”中尉尖叫了起来，“你把我的眼弄瞎了！你把我的眼弄瞎了！”

“抓紧他！”医生说，“他这是疼的。抓紧不要放松！”

“他是哪里中的枪？”

“肚子上中了两枪。只找到了一颗子弹。”

他们俩都是种甜菜的工人，一个是墨西哥人，一个是俄国人。事发时，他们正坐在一家通宵营业的饭馆里喝咖啡。一个人走进门，对着墨西哥人就开枪。墨西哥人肚子上中了两枪，倒在了地上。俄国人吓得躲到了桌子底下，可还是被一颗射向墨西哥人的流弹所击中。报上就是这么说的。

墨西哥人向警方提供口供时说，他也不清楚开枪的是何人。他认为这是一次偶然的事故。

“还说是事故！他向你开了八枪，两枪打在了你身上！”

“是事故，先生。(1)”这位叫卡耶塔诺·瑞兹的墨西哥人说。

“他开枪打我，只是一次事故，那个混账东西(2)。”他对译员说。

“他说什么？”警官看了看站在病床另一侧的译员问。

“他说那是一次事故。”

“让他实话实说。他快要死了。”警官说。

“死不了的。”卡耶塔诺说，“不过请你告诉他，我感到很难受，不想再多说了。”

“他说他讲的句句是实话。”译员说。随后，他又自信地对警官补充了一句：“他搞不清开枪的是何人。子弹是从后边射向他的。”

“是呀，”警官说，“这我知道。可是，子弹为什么是从前边射进他的身体里的。”

“也许他晕了头了。”译员说。

“你给我听着！”警官说话时，晃动着手指，几乎把手指戳到了卡耶塔诺的鼻子上——那个鼻子蜡黄蜡黄，高高嵌在死人一般的脸上，眼睛却鹰眼一样炯炯有神。“我才不管是谁开枪打你，只需要把事情搞个水落石出。难道你就不想把开枪打你的凶手绳之以法吗？你把这话讲给他听。”他对译员说。

“他说让你说出向你开枪的人。”

“让他下地狱去吧。(3)”已经精疲力竭的卡耶塔诺说。

“他说他压根就没有看见枪手。”译员说，“我可以肯定地说，枪手是从背后开的枪。”

“你问他是谁开枪打的那个俄国人？”

“可怜的俄国佬，”卡耶塔诺说，“他趴在地上，双手抱头，中弹时叽里哇啦乱叫，直到现在还在叫呢。可怜的俄国佬。”

“他说他不认识那个枪手，也许和开枪打他的是同一人吧。”

“你给我听着，”警官说，“此处不是芝加哥，你也不是黑帮，不用像演电影一样装腔作势。把开枪打你的人供出来就万事大吉。供出凶手是每一个人的责任。这是正确的选择。假如你不说，他还会去伤害别人的。也许他还会射杀女人或孩子呢。不能就这么叫他逍遥法外。你把这话讲给他听。”他冲着弗雷泽先生说道，“那个可恶的译员不能叫我信任。”

“我是完全可以信任的。”译员说。

卡耶塔诺把目光转向弗雷泽先生看了看。

“听着，朋友，”弗雷泽先生启口说道，“这位警官说此处不是芝加哥，而是蒙大拿州的黑利。你不是黑帮，跟演电影的不着边。”

“我相信他的话。”卡耶塔诺轻声说，“我敢说是这样的。(4)”

“告发凶手是光荣的职责。他说这儿人人如此。他说凶手开枪打了你，再去打女人或孩子，那该如何是好？”

“我没结婚。”卡耶塔诺说。

“他是说去杀任何一个女人或孩子。”

“那个人并不是疯子。”卡耶塔诺说。

“他说你应该告发他。”弗雷泽先生最后说道。

“谢谢你。”卡耶塔诺说，“你是个非常好的翻译。英语我也会说，就是差了些，不过听还是能听懂的。你的腿是怎么断的？”

“从马上摔下来摔断的。”

“真不走运。很遗憾。疼得厉害吗？”

“现在不厉害了。一开始倒是挺疼的。”

“听我说，朋友，”卡耶塔诺说道，“我现在非常虚弱。对不起了。而且伤口疼得厉害，疼得死去活来。我很可能会去见阎王爷的。请你让这位警官出去吧，我累得要命。”他动了动，像是要翻过身去了，随即收住了口。

“我把你的话原原本本说给他听了。他让我转告你，说他真的不知道谁开的枪。他说他虚弱得厉害，希望以后再问他吧。”弗雷泽先生说道。

“以后他闹不定会死了的。”

“这很有可能。”

“正因为如此，我才想现在问清他。”

“依我看，凶手是从背后开的枪。”译员说。

“哦，请别这么肯定。”警官说着话，一边将笔录本放进了口袋。




出了病房来到走廊里，警官和译员站在弗雷泽先生的轮椅旁边。

“你大概也认为凶手是从后边开的枪吧？”

“是的。”弗雷泽说，“是从背后开的枪。依你所见呢？”

“你可别生气噢，”警官说，“真希望我会讲西班牙语。”

“那你为什么不学呢？”

“你不必生气。用西班牙语问来问去，结果难以叫人满意。如果我会说西班牙语，情况就不一样了。”

“这就大可不必了。”译员说，“我的翻译是十分能叫人信赖的。”

“哦，请别这么肯定。”警官说，“好啦，告辞啦。回头我来看你。”

“多谢。我一直都在这儿呢。”

“我想你现在的状况是不错的。出那样的事实在是不走运，倒霉透了。”

“把骨头接起来后，情况就好转了。”

“是呀，但恢复起来得用很长时间。不是一时半会儿就能好的。”

“可别叫人从背后打你的冷枪。”

“说得对，”他说，“说得对。哦，很高兴你没有生我的气。”

“再见喽。”弗雷泽先生说。




弗雷泽先生有好长一段时间都没有再见到卡耶塔诺，但每天早晨塞西莉亚修女都带来他的消息。修女说他的状况很糟，却极少唉声叹气。他患上了腹膜炎，都认为他活不了了。修女说他真是可怜。他的手是那样的漂亮，脸蛋是那样的英俊，从来没听他说过抱怨的话。眼下，他的伤口散发的气味难闻得刺鼻。她说他老是用手指指指自己的鼻子，咧嘴一笑，然后摇摇头。他对自己身上的气味感到难堪，塞西莉亚修女说他为此很是窘迫。啊，他真是一个讨人喜欢的病人，脸上老挂着微笑。他不愿对神父做忏悔，但是答应会念祈祷词。自从他进了医院，没有一个墨西哥人来探望他。那个俄国人周末就要出院了。塞西莉亚修女说她对那个俄国人一点感觉都没有。那家伙也受够了洋罪。射中他的是一颗涂了油的脏子弹，伤口感染了，但他的叫声也太搅扰人了。修女说她一向喜欢坏人，而卡耶塔诺就是个坏人，一个地地道道的坏人，一个彻头彻尾的坏人。他谈吐优雅，身材秀美，好像从来没有干过体力活。他不可能是种甜菜的工人，绝对不可能是！他的手光滑细腻，没有一个茧子，一看就知道是某一种类型的坏人。修女说这就下楼为他做祈祷去。可怜的卡耶塔诺呀，遭受了那样的痛苦，却一声也不吭。凶手向他开枪，究竟是为了什么？天呀，可怜的卡耶塔诺！这就下楼为他做祈祷去！

修女说完下楼去为卡耶塔诺做祈祷了。




医院里有架收音机，在暮色垂降之前音响效果一直都不太好。据说是因为地底下矿石太多的缘故，或者是因为大山阻隔的缘故，反正音效就是不好，直到外边天擦黑时才改善。这之后的一整夜，它的音效又好极了，一个电台停止播音后，可以再选西边的台，收听另一个电台的节目。最后一个停播的是华盛顿州的西雅图台。由于时差的关系，他们的信号中断是在凌晨四点钟，而此时医院里的时间则是凌晨五点。到了六点钟，则可以收听到明尼阿波利斯(5)电台在上午播放的狂欢曲，这也是因为时差的缘故。弗雷泽先生常常遐想连篇，想象着那些制作狂欢曲的音乐人在上午抵达电台的情况，想象着他们带着乐器天还没亮走下电车的画面。也许他的想象与事实不符——音乐人的乐器是存放在电台里的。可是，在他的想象中音乐人们总是随身携带着乐器。他从未去过明尼阿波利斯，而且觉得自己恐怕这辈子都不会去的，可他知道那座城市一大早是怎样一种情状。

从医院的窗口，可以看见田野里白雪皑皑，雪中露出一簇簇滚草，还可以看见一座光秃秃的土山丘。一天上午，医生想让弗雷泽先生看外边的雪地里有两只野鸡，把他的床向窗口拖，结果床头铁架上的台灯掉下来砸在了弗雷泽先生的脑袋上。这事现在听上去并不可笑，但当时却显得非常滑稽。大伙都凑上去向窗外看，那个医生（一个出类拔萃的医生）一边手指野鸡的那个方向，一边把床朝着窗口拖。就像滑稽连环漫画里画的那样，台灯的铅座直直砸在弗雷泽先生的脑门上，把他给砸昏了。这似乎与医院救死扶伤的准则唱对台戏，或者说也不符合医护人员的行为，反正大家都觉得怪滑稽的，是上天跟弗雷泽先生和那个医生开了个玩笑。在医院里，一切事情都非常简单，连开玩笑也是如此。

如果把床转个方向，从另外一个窗口可以看见市景，看见城市上空轻烟袅袅，还可以看见道森群山，山上冬雪皑皑，看上去真是地道的雄山峻岭。如果坐轮椅还太早，就只能看这两处景色了。在医院里，最好是卧床观景。在一个温度可以自控的房间里消消停停地观两处景色，要比在一个热烘烘、空荡荡的房间里匆匆忙忙观若干处景色强得多了——那样的空房间是等病人入住的，或者是刚刚腾空的，你坐着个轮椅进进出出，哪有心思观景。在一个房间待久了，不管观的是什么景，那个景都会产生巨大的价值，变得无比重要，让你受不了它的变化，连变个角度都不情愿。听收音机跟这同出一理，有些节目听惯了就割舍不了，心生依恋，而讨厌新的节目。这年冬天，他们最喜欢听的曲子是《唱一件简单的事情》、《献歌的女孩》和《小小的善意谎言》。弗雷泽先生觉得别的曲子都不如意。《女生贝蒂》也不失为一首好曲子，只是歌词落了俗套，不可避免地进入弗雷泽先生的心房，逐渐让他觉得粗俗，别的人也不愿再听，最后他干脆弃而不听，又回过头去重新听橄榄球球赛。

早晨九点钟左右，医院里开始使用X光机，此时收音机只能收到黑利台，成了无用的摆设。许多有收音机的黑利人提出过抗议，怪医院使用X光机使他们听不清上午的节目。尽管大家都觉得医院不像话，说他们完全可以在别人不听收音机的时候再使用X光机，可是院方并未采取任何措施。




差不多就在需要关掉收音机的时候，塞西莉亚修女走了进来。

“卡耶塔诺的情况怎么样啦，塞西莉亚修女？”弗雷泽先生问。

“哦，情况很糟。”

“昏迷了吗？”

“没有。不过，他恐怕保不住命了。”

“你怎么样？”

“我挺为他担心的。你知道吗，没有一个人来看望过他。他会像一条狗一样死去的，那些墨西哥老乡们才不管呢。那些人真是可怕。”

“今天下午你愿意过来听橄榄球球赛吗？”

“哦，不了。”她说，“听球赛太让人兴奋了。我还是到教堂里做祈祷吧。”

“下午应该能听得很清的。”弗雷泽先生，“他们正在太平洋沿岸比赛，由于时差的关系，比赛的时间在这儿已经很晚了，是可以听得清的。”

“哦，不了，我不能再听了。上次听世界职业棒球大赛，差点没要我的命。运动员击球时，我就大声祈祷：‘主啊，引导一下他们击球的目光吧！啊，主啊，保佑他击中吧！啊，主啊，保佑他一击便中吧！’第三局他们竟然打了个满垒，你该记得，那情景真让我承受不了。‘啊，主啊，愿他把球打出场地！啊，主啊，愿他把球打出围栏！’轮到红雀队击球时，我的感觉可怕极了。‘啊，主啊，愿他们看不见球！啊，主啊，愿他们连球的影子也看不见！啊，主啊，愿他们三振出局！’这次比赛会叫我更受不了的。参赛的有圣母玛利亚队。那是我们的队。不行，我还是去教堂里吧，在那儿为圣母祈祷。他们打比赛是为了圣母而战。希望你哪一天能写篇东西赞美圣母。你可以写出来的。我知道你有这个能力，弗雷泽先生。”

“关于圣母，我不知该写什么好。基本上能写的都有人写了。”弗雷泽先生说，“再说，你不会喜欢我的笔风的，圣母也不会喜欢的。”

“你哪一天写一篇就是了。”修女说，“我知道你一定会写的。你必须写篇东西赞美我们的圣母。”

“劝你最好还是来听听比赛吧。”

“那会叫我受不了的。不行，我还是去教堂做自己力所能及的事情吧。”

这天下午，比赛进行了大约有五分钟的时间，一个见习护士走进病房说：“塞西莉亚修女想知道比赛进行得怎么样了。”

“告诉她，就说圣母队已经触底得分。”

没多大一会儿，那个见习护士又来病房里了。

“告诉她，圣母队打得对方乱了阵脚。”弗雷泽先生说。

片刻之后，他摇铃叫来当班护士说：“你能不能到教堂里去一趟，给塞西莉亚修女捎个话，就说在头一场四分之一决赛结束时圣母队以十四比零领先。状况很好。让她不用再祈祷了。”

过了没几分钟，塞西莉亚修女自个儿跑了来，情绪非常激动，说道：“十四比零是什么意思？这种赛事我是一无所知。要说棒球比赛，这可是压倒一切的优势。而橄榄球比赛，我就一窍不通了。也许这个比分算不了什么吧。我还是到教堂里去继续祈祷吧，一直祈祷至比赛结束。”

“对手已被彻底打翻在地。”弗雷泽说，“我保证他们已被击败。你留下来跟我一起听吧。”

“不行，不行，这万万使不得。”修女说，“我还是去教堂做祈祷吧。”

此后，圣母队一得分，弗雷泽先生就托人送消息去教堂，等到最后将比赛结果托人送去，天色已经黑下去许久了。

“塞西莉亚修女怎么样？”

“她们都还在教堂里呢。”送消息的人说。

翌日晨，塞西莉亚修女走进病房，满面春色，显得信心十足。

“我就知道对方打不过圣母队。”她说道，“他们休想。卡耶塔诺也好了些，状况好多了。就要有人来探望他了。他目前还不能见人，但他们会来的。有人来，会叫他心里好受些；由此他知道自己没有被同胞忘掉。我下楼去，瞧见警察总部的那个年轻警官奥布莱恩，让他去找几个墨西哥人来看望可怜的卡耶塔诺。他今天下午就去找几个来。到了那时，这个可怜人心里会感到好受些。受了伤，竟然没一个人来看望，真是太可恶了。”

这天下午五点钟左右，三个墨西哥人走了进来。

“能喝上一杯吗？”块头最大的墨西哥人问道。此人厚嘴唇，胖得不得了。

“当然可以！”弗雷泽先生回答，“都请坐，先生们。都喝上一杯吗？”

“多谢了。”大块头说。

“那就谢谢了。”皮肤最黑、个头最小的一个说。

“谢谢，我就不喝了，”一个瘦子说，“喝了上头。”他说着还用手在头上拍了拍。

护士取来了几个玻璃杯。“请你把酒瓶递给他们。”弗雷泽说，“这是从‘红房子’买的。”他解释了一句。

“‘红房子’的酒最好，”大块头说，“比‘大树木’的酒强多了。”

“这是秃子头上的虱子明摆着的，”个头最小的那个说，“只是价格也贵。”

“‘红房子’的酒价物有所值。”大块头说。

“这台收音机是几个管的？”不喝酒的那个问道。

“七个。”

“好漂亮呀。”他说，“这得值多少钱？”

“我也不知道，”弗雷泽先生说，“是租来的。”

“你们几位先生是卡耶塔诺的朋友吧？”

“不是。”大块头说，“我们是打伤他的那个人的朋友。”

“是警察叫我们来的。”个头最小的那个说。

“我们的地位低下。”大块头说，“我和他都一样。”他指了指那个不喝酒的，“他也地位低下。”这次他指的是皮肤黝黑的小个子，“警察叫我们来，我们就来了。”

“你们能来，我很高兴。”

“彼此彼此。”大块头说。

“再来一小杯吧？”

“恭敬不如从命。”大块头说。

“大家干杯！”个头最小的那个说。

“我可不行，”瘦子说，“喝了就上头。”

“这酒是非常好的酒。”个头最小的那个说。

“何不尝上一杯。”弗雷泽先生劝说瘦子道，“就是上点头又何妨。”

“酒劲一过就头疼。”瘦子说。

“难道就不能找几个卡耶塔诺的朋友来看望一下他吗？”弗雷泽问。

“他压根就没有朋友。”

“人生在世都是有朋友的呀。”

“这个人却没有。”

“他是干什么的？”

“纸牌手。”

“牌术高吗？”

“我认为很高。”

“他赢过我的钱，”个头最小的那个说，“赢过我一百八十块钱。一百八十块钱就这么打了水漂。”

“也赢过我的钱，”瘦子说，“赢了我二百零十一块钱。这可不是个小数目。”

“我没跟他打过牌。”大块头说。

“他一定非常有钱喽。”弗雷泽先生说。

“他比我们还穷呢，”小个子墨西哥人说，“除了身上那件衣服，他什么都没有。”

“那件衣服不值什么钱，”弗雷泽先生说，“上面净是窟窿眼。”

“完全如此。”

“打伤他的那个人也是个纸牌手？”

“不是的。他是个种甜菜的工人。这下子，他只得被迫离开这座城市了。”

“想想这多叫人伤心吧。”个头最小的那个说，“他可是这座城市里最优秀的吉他手呢。简直无与伦比。”

“真是叫人嗟叹。”

“是这样的。”大块头说，“他把吉他弹得出神入化。”

“他一走，就没有好的吉他手了吗？”

“好的吉他手恐怕连影子也找不到了。”

“有个风琴手倒是表现不俗。”瘦子说。

“还有几个人是多面手，会玩几种乐器。”大块头说，“你喜欢音乐？”

“哪能不喜欢呢！”

“我们哪天晚上来演奏一下怎么样？依你看，修女会同意吗？她看上去挺和气的。”

“只要能让卡耶塔诺听上音乐，我敢肯定她会允许的。”

“她是不是有点疯疯癫癫的？”瘦子问。

“谁？”

“那个修女呀。”

“没有的事。”弗雷泽先生说，“她是个大好人，脑子聪明，富于同情之心。”

“反正对于牧师啦，僧侣啦，修女啦，我全都不信任。”瘦子说。

“他年轻时有过一段痛苦的经历。”个头最小的那个说。

“我当过牧师的助手。”瘦子带着几分得意的神色说，“现在我什么都不相信了，也不去做弥撒了。”

“为什么？莫非做弥撒会上头？”

“哪里的话。”瘦子说，“只有喝酒才会上头的。宗教是穷人的鸦片。”

“我原以为大麻才是穷人的鸦片呢。”弗雷泽说。

“你抽过鸦片吗？”大块头问。

“没抽过。”

“我也没抽过。”他说，“那玩意儿好像非常可怕，一旦抽上就戒不了了。实在害人不浅。”

“跟宗教一样。”瘦子说。

“这家伙对宗教持坚决反对的态度。”个头最小的那个墨西哥人说。

“不喜欢，就有必要持坚决反对的态度。”弗雷泽先生有礼貌地说。

“我尊敬的是那些虽然无知，但有信仰的人。”瘦子说。

“说得好。”弗雷泽先生称赞道。

“我们来时给你带什么好呢？”大块头墨西哥人问道，“你缺什么呢？”

“如果有好啤酒能买一些来，我将会很高兴的。”

“那我们就带啤酒来。”

“临走之前，再来上一杯这雪莉酒怎么样？”

“非常好。”

“让你破费了。”

“我喝不成，会上头的。酒劲一过就会头疼，而且胃里翻江倒海的。”

“再见，先生们。”

“再见。谢谢款待。”

这几个墨西哥人走了。弗雷泽先生吃过晚饭，然后听收音机，尽可能调低音量，调到刚能听得见的程度。最后，各地的电台按以下的次序停止了播音：丹佛、盐湖城、洛杉矶和西雅图。听收音机，弗雷泽先生无从得知丹佛是怎么样一幅情景。从《丹佛邮报》上，他倒是可以看到丹佛的画面，再从《洛基山新闻报》上对他的印象加以校正。至于盐湖城和洛杉矶，他只有所耳闻，却一点感觉都没有。对于盐湖城，他唯一的感觉是那儿环境干净但却枯燥乏味；要说洛杉矶，那儿大酒店多如牛毛，酒店里歌舞厅也多得不得了，让他无法想象那究竟是怎样一座城市。光凭歌舞厅，他无法对一座城市产生感觉。不过，对于西雅图他却了如指掌——出租车公司拥有清一色的白颜色大型号的出租车（每辆出租车里配备有收音机），他想象着自己每天晚上都乘车去加拿大境内的那家路边旅馆里去，在那儿根据客人打电话点的乐曲了解诸多晚会的进程。从下午两点钟起，他每天晚上都置身于西雅图，听着形形色色的人所点的曲子。他知道，明尼阿波利斯的那些狂欢曲演奏人黎明即起，匆忙赶到电台里。而西雅图和明尼阿波利斯同样的真实。对于华盛顿州的西雅图，弗雷泽先生简直心醉神迷。

那几个墨西哥人来了，把啤酒也带来了，只不过不是好啤酒。弗雷泽先生接待了他们，可是却没情没绪，不愿多说话。客人走后，他情知他们再也不会来了。他的神经变得很脆弱，一旦出现这种状况，他就不愿见人。五个星期结束时，他的神经已经一团糟。他为自己的神经能撑这么久而感到欣慰，却也有几分气恼——明明知道有这样的结果，他竟然还违背心愿地接受了这样的实验。这一套过程，他以前早就经历过了。对他而言，唯有听收音机有尝鲜的味道。听收音机，他一听就是一宿，将音量调低，低到几乎刚能听得见的程度。他逐渐学会了只听收音机，而不浮想联翩。




那天上午十点钟左右，塞西莉亚修女来到了病房里，把他的信件送来了。修女长得花容月貌，弗雷泽先生喜欢看她，也喜欢听她说话，但信件像是来自于另一个世界，分量要更重些。可惜的是信的内容引不起他任何兴趣。

“你看上去气色好多啦，”修女说，“用不了多久便可以出院了。”

“是呀。”弗雷泽先生说，“今天上午你满脸的喜色。”

“哦，是这样的。今天上午我有一种感觉，觉得自己好像成了圣徒。”

弗雷泽先生一愣，一时没回过神来。

“是这样的，”塞西莉亚修女喋喋不休地说，“成为圣徒是我的夙愿。当我还是个小姑娘时，我就渴望当一名圣徒。小的时候，我觉得只要出家进修道院当修女，有朝一日就可以成为圣徒。那是我朝思暮想的愿望，唯有如此才能实现这一愿望。我盼啊盼，只盼成为圣徒。我有十二分的信心，认为自己必将成功。刚才，我产生了一种感觉，觉得自己成了圣徒。我感到幸福极了。那一切似乎来得十分简单，十分容易。早晨一醒来，我就指望着脱胎换骨成为圣徒。只是始终没有脱离凡胎。我是多么渴望立地成为圣徒啊。心怀这一夙愿由来已久。今天上午，我觉得自己好像已成为圣徒。啊，真希望我美梦成真，成为圣徒啊。”

“你会如愿以偿的。有志者事竟成嘛。这是前辈的谆谆教导。”

“现在我有点吃不准了。小的时候事情似乎简单得很，觉得自己一定能成为圣徒。后来发现这一愿望不能在一朝一夕实现，我便想到这是个旷日持久的过程。现在却觉得这一目标可望而不可即了。”

“依我看，你大有可能实现。”

“你真的这么想？算啦，我可不想只听听鼓舞人心的话。你就不用给我打气了。我反正心里只想当圣徒，这是我的一个强烈的愿望。”

“你肯定会成为圣徒的。”弗雷泽先生说。

“哎，恐怕这一愿望难以实现了。啊，只要能当上圣徒，那该有多好呀！我会感到无比幸福的。”

“你有压倒一切的机会成为圣徒的。”

“算啦，请不要再说鼓舞人心的话了。啊，只要能当上圣徒，那该有多好呀！只要能当上圣徒，那该有多好呀！”

“你的朋友卡耶塔诺怎么样啦？”

“伤情会好起来的，只是瘫痪了。一颗子弹击中了大腿上一根主要的神经，那条腿算是瘫痪了。他伤情好转，可以挪动时，才发现了这一情况。”

“也许神经可以再生吧。”

“但愿能再生。”塞西莉亚修女说，“你应该见见他。”

“我不想见人，任何人都不想见。”

“可是他，你一定想见的。可以让她们用轮椅把他推到这儿来。”

“那好吧。”




护士用轮椅将他推了来。只见他面容消瘦，皮肤透明，一头黑发欠剪理，眼里饱含笑意，一笑就露出一口坏牙。

“你好，朋友！怎么样呀？(6)”

“你也看到了，就这个样。”弗雷泽先生说，“你怎么样？”

“活下来了，但腿瘫痪了。”

“真糟糕。”弗雷泽先生说，“不过，神经是可以再生的，再生出来的跟原来的一样管用。”

“他们也是这么对我讲的。”

“伤口现在还疼吗？”

“目前已不疼了。有段时间肚子上的伤疼得要死，差点没叫我发疯。我觉得再那么疼下去，准会要我的命。”

此时，塞西莉亚修女在一旁看着他俩，一脸的幸福。

“修女告诉我，说你吭都没有吭一声。”弗雷泽先生说。

“病房里人多，不能乱叫。”墨西哥人不在意地说，“你疼得厉害不厉害？”

“够厉害的了。不过跟你相比就小巫见大巫了。护士一走开，我就喊叫上一两个小时，然后就安静下来。现在我的神经不行了，控制不了了。”

“你可有收音机做伴呀。如果我有自己独立的房间和一台收音机，我就使劲地喊，使劲地叫，彻夜不息。”

“我不信。”

“朋友，我会叫的(7)，叫出声来就舒服一些。可是周围人多就不能这样做了。”

“最起码，”弗雷泽先生说，“你的手完好无损。据说你是靠双手糊口的。”

“还靠脑袋。”卡耶塔诺说着拍了拍脑门，“不过，若论价值，脑袋是不如手的。”

“你的三个老乡曾到这儿来过。”

“是警察让他们来看我的。”

“他们带来了一些啤酒。”

“恐怕是劣质啤酒。”

“是劣质的。”

“今晚，他们奉警察之命要来给我演奏小夜曲呢。”他哈哈大笑起来，后来轻轻拍拍肚皮说，“有伤口，不敢笑了。要说音乐师，他们可真是滥竽充数。”

“向你开枪的那个人呢？”

“也是个蠢货。我打牌赢过他三十八块钱，可那也不值得置人于死地呀。”

“那三个老乡说你赢了许多钱呢。”

“我还不是比别人穷嘛。”

“怎么回事？”

“我是个可怜的理想主义者，是幻想的牺牲品。”他哈哈大笑起来，随即咧咧嘴，又轻轻拍了拍肚皮，“我是个职业赌徒，而且喜欢赌博，喜欢真正的赌博。小打小闹的赌博凭的是抽老千，而真正的赌博需要有运气。我所缺的就是运气。”

“历来如此吗？”

“历来如此。我是个一点运气都没有的人。说说那个向我开枪的蠢蛋吧。他会打枪吗？不会的。他第一枪打空了，第二枪击中了那个倒霉的俄国人。这样，似乎我的运气还不错吧？可后来呢？他两枪打在了我的肚子上。他是个幸运儿，而我无好运可言。要是让他踩着马镫，他恐怕连马的肚皮都不会踢。他凭的全是运气。”

“我还以为他先击中了你，然后才是那个俄国人呢。”

“不对。先击中俄国人，后击中我。报社的记者搞颠倒了。”

“你为何不开枪打他呢？”

“我身上从不带枪。凭我这臭运气，如果带枪在身，一年恐怕会被绞死十次。说到底，我只不过是个卑微的纸牌手罢了。”他中间停顿了一下，随后又说了下去。“我一有钱就赌，一赌就输。掷骰子，我输了三千块钱，次次输，没有中过六点。掷骰子可没有抽老千，运气欠佳非止一次。”

“为什么还要赌下去？”

“总觉得只要活着，运气会变的。十五年来，坏运如影随形跟着我。一旦好运降临，我就会一朝成为富佬。”他咧嘴笑了笑。“我是个出色的赌徒，赢了钱我会乐在其中。”

“你不管赌什么，都运气不好吗？”

“事事倒运，情场上也一样。”他又笑了笑，露出了一口坏牙。

“真的吗？”

“真的。”

“这该如何是好？”

“继续干呗，悠着点，等待着峰回路转。”

“情场上呢？”

“没有一个赌徒是情场得意的。他太专注于自己的事业，晚上需要跟女伴在一起，他却忙碌于赌场。晚上下赌场的人是拴不住女人的心的——如果那个女人有可取之处的话。”

“你可真是个哲学家哟。”

“过奖了，朋友。鄙人只不过是一个小地方的赌徒，云游四方，以四海为家，跌倒了再爬起来。”

“后来肚子上中了枪。”

“那可是破天荒第一遭儿。”他说，“这事只发生过一次。”

“这么说话，你累了吧？”弗雷泽先生问。

“不累。”他说，“肯定让你累着了。”

“腿怎么样？”

“这条腿对我用处不大，有没有它都无所谓。反正我是有办法走动的。”

“祝你好运，真诚地、打心眼里祝你好运。”弗雷泽先生说。

“彼此彼此。”他说，“祝你疼痛全消。”

“它持续不了多久的，会消失的。区区小事一桩。”

“愿你的疼痛感迅速消失。”

“彼此彼此。”




那天晚上，几个墨西哥人来病房演奏手风琴及其他乐器，引起一片欢腾。悠扬的手风琴声、铃声、管弦乐声和鼓声响彻了整个走廊。病房里有个马戏团的飞车手。在一个炎热、尘土飞扬的下午，在“午夜剧场”表演时，观众人山人海，他飞车时从滑道上跌落，摔断了脊梁骨。伤好出院后，他恐怕得改行当皮匠或藤椅工了。还有个病号是木匠，搭脚手架时和脚手架一道摔在了地上，两个脚踝和两个手腕全都摔断了。他像猫一样摔在了地上，却没有猫的柔韧性。医生倒是可以将他修理好，让他能够重新工作，但这得用很长的时间。病人中还有个小伙子，是农村来的，大约十六岁，断腿给接错了茬，得敲断重新接。再下来就是卡耶塔诺·瑞兹——一个小地方的赌徒，一条腿瘫痪了。弗雷泽先生可以听见这些人欢快的笑声回荡在走廊里，他们被警察差来的那几个墨西哥人演奏的音乐逗得乐翻了天。那几个墨西哥人大显身手。他们按捺不住激动的心情，跑到弗雷泽先生的病房里来，询问他有没有自己想听的曲子需要他们演奏。过后，他们不请自来，又主动在晚间来演奏了两场。

他们最后一次演奏时，弗雷泽先生躺在自己的病房里，敞着门，耳朵听着那热闹、拙劣的音乐，心里禁不住陷入了沉思。当那几个人过来问他想听什么曲子时，他点了《蟑螂曲》(8)，此曲里的许多调子轻快、活泼，人们喜欢得要命。几位乐手把这个曲子演奏得热闹而富于感情。在弗雷泽先生的心目中，《蟑螂曲》比大多数同类曲子都感人，可这几位乐手演奏的效果却雷同。

尽管情绪受到了感染，弗雷泽先生的心里仍在苦苦思索着。通常，除了在写作时，他能不思考问题就不去费这个脑筋，可此刻他却苦思不已，想着这些演奏乐曲的人以及瘦子所说的那一席话。

宗教是人民的鸦片。他相信这话，相信那个肠胃不好、瘦小的皮包骨头的人。对啦，音乐也是人民的鸦片。那个喝酒就上头的老哥可没有想到这一点。经济问题也是人民的鸦片。在意大利和德国，连同爱国主义全都是人民的鸦片。性交呢？性交是不是人民的鸦片？对有些人是的。对一些最优秀的人而言，性交就是人民的鸦片。喝酒是人民最好的鸦片，啊，多么好的鸦片啊。有些人喜欢听收音机，而这也是人民的鸦片，是他正在吸食的廉价鸦片。赌博和这些是同类，也是人民的鸦片（如果有鸦片的话），一种最古老的鸦片。抱负也算其中的一种，也是人民的鸦片，连同对新类型统治的信仰都是一个样。人们所需要的是最低限度的统治，越少统治越好。我们所信仰的自由如今成了麦克菲登(9)出版的一本杂志的名字。我们信仰那一事业，虽然尚未为它找到一个新的名称。不过，真正的自由是什么呢？真正的、地道的人民的鸦片又是什么呢？答案他知道得很清楚——它就在他心里一拐弯的地方，在一个亮亮堂堂的地方。自从傍晚喝了两三杯酒后，它就一直在那儿。他知道它就在那儿（当然并非真的在那儿）。答案是什么来着？反正他清楚得很。那是什么来着？当然喽，面包是人民的鸦片。他能记得住吗？天亮时还明白其中的含义吗？面包是人民的鸦片！

“听我说，”弗雷泽先生见护士走进来，便对她说道，“请你把那个瘦小的墨西哥人找来，好不好？”

“你喜欢听那曲子吧？”那个墨西哥人来时，站在门跟前说。

“非常喜欢。”

“那个曲子具有历史意义，”墨西哥人说，“是真正的革命曲子。”

“听着，”弗雷泽先生说，“给人做手术时为什么不打麻药？”

“这些我不懂。”

“为什么并非所有人民的鸦片都是好鸦片？对于人民，你想采取什么措施呢？”

“应该把他们从愚昧中拯救出来。”

“你可别乱放空炮。教育是人民的鸦片。对此你应该知道的。你自己不就受过一点教育嘛。”

“你不相信教育？”

“不相信。”弗雷泽先生说，“对于知识嘛，我倒是相信的。”

“我不明白你的意思。”

“我经常连自己都不明白呢，倒也开心。”

“下一次还想听《蟑螂曲》吗？”墨西哥人面带几分忧虑问道。

“是的。”弗雷泽先生说，“下次还演奏《蟑螂曲》吧。这比听收音机强。”

弗雷泽先生心里在思索，革命不是鸦片。革命是一种净化剂，是一种只有通过暴力才能够延续的狂热。鸦片往往用于革命前和革命后。他的这一想法很好，简直有点太好了。

他心想，那几个墨西哥人马上就要走了，将把《蟑螂曲》一起带走。那时，他就来上一小杯烈性酒，打开收音机，把音量调得低低的，调到刚能听得见的程度。

父亲们和儿子们


城市通衢大道的中央竖着一面牌子，要车辆绕行，可是汽车却公然不顾，偏要直直穿过去。据此，尼古拉斯·亚当斯认为那儿曾经修路，现已修完，于是也就沿着那条空荡荡、砖砌的大街把车子朝前开去，穿城而过。星期天车辆少，红绿灯却换来换去，他只好走走停停的。财政上要是支付不起这套指示灯系统，这红绿灯明年可就亮不起来了。小城的树木郁郁葱葱，遮在道路两旁。你要是当地人，在树下散散步，倒是满可心的，但外地人则不然，他会觉得树荫太浓，挡住阳光，屋里难免受潮。尼古拉斯·亚当斯驾车驶过最后的一幢房屋，驶上了一起一伏向前延伸的公路，红土路堤修得平平整整，两旁排列着新培育出的树苗。此处不是他的家乡，但时值仲秋，满眼秋色，开车路过倒也赏心悦目。地里的棉花已摘完，空地上种了一片片的玉米，有的玉米地块之间还种了几排红高粱。汽车行驶得很顺当；儿子在身旁的座位上熟睡着；一天的行程已经结束；对于歇宿的那座城市他是很熟悉的。在这种情况下，尼克(1)看着景色，留意着哪块玉米地里夹杂着黄豆或豌豆，留意着林子和垦地的布局，留意着小木屋和住宅在田头及林间的分布情况，一路行驶一路想象着如何在这一带打猎；每每驶过一片林间空地，他都要心里做个评估，看猎物会在哪儿觅食和筑巢，看在何处能发现鸟群，看它们会朝哪个方向飞。

猎杀鹌鹑时，猎犬一旦发现它们，你可千万别挡住它们的归巢之路，否则，它们会一哄而起，直直地向你冲来，有的直飞高空，有的则噌地从你耳边掠过，呼呼带着风声，身影和它们在空中相比显得无比巨大。唯一的办法就是背过身去，让它们从你的肩头飞过，待它们收翅，眼看就要入林时，你就开枪。在这种地区打鹌鹑的方法是他的父亲教给他的。此时此刻，尼古拉斯·亚当斯不由思念起了自己的慈父。一想到慈父，必然会想起那双眼睛。父亲身材魁梧，动作敏捷，宽肩膀，鹰钩鼻，尖瘦的下巴上留着一把胡子——可是，总是令他难以忘怀的是那双眼睛。那双眼睛遮在两道浓眉之下，深深嵌在头颅里，好像是一种稀世珍宝以这样的布局受到特殊保护似的。这双眼睛比任何人眼都要看得远，目光都要敏锐得多，是上天赐给父亲的珍贵礼物。实际上，父亲的一双眼敏锐如巨角山羊之眼，又如雄鹰之眼。

当年他和父亲站在湖岸边（那时，他的眼力是非常好的），父亲常对他说：“对面把旗子升起来了。”尼克却怎么看也看不见旗子，也看不见旗杆。接下来，父亲又会说道：“那是你妹妹多萝西升的。她把旗子升起，现在在朝码头上走。”

尼克向湖对岸望去，可以看见林木葱茏的长长的湖岸线以及背后的那些参天大树，能看见护卫着湖湾的岬角，看得见田头轮廓清晰的山丘和他们家树影婆娑的白色房子，但就是看不见任何旗杆或码头，所见的只是白色的沙滩和弯曲的湖岸。

“你能看得见岬角那边山坡上的羊群吗？”

“看得见。”

它们看上去只是灰绿色山丘上的几个白点而已。

“我能数得清有几只。”

跟所有具备超常能力的人一样，父亲是很神经质的。而且，他还喜欢感情用事——和大多数感情用事的人一样，他能狠得下心来，却也常常受人欺负。另外，他老是厄运缠身，而有些厄运并非他自己招来的。他是因为一个圈套丧的命（这个圈套也有他作恶的成分在里边）——那些家伙在他生前曾耍出各种花样欺骗他。感情用事的人老是被人欺骗。尼克目前还不能写东西纪念他，不过以后会写的。只是看见眼前的这片鹌鹑狩猎地，他触景生情，想起了父亲而已。他小的时候，尤其感谢父亲的有两点：钓鱼和打猎。父亲对这两件事是行家里手，对两性方面的事见解却不高明（只是举例而已），这种状况倒是让尼克挺高兴的。当他需要拥有枪和使用枪的时候，正是父亲给了他第一支猎枪，给他提供了开枪的机会；当他需要学打猎和钓鱼的时候，正是父亲能让他住在有猎物可打，有鱼可钓的地方。如今三十八岁，他仍喜欢钓鱼和打猎，热情不减于当年第一次跟随父亲去钓鱼、打猎时。这是一种激情，一种从未消减过的激情。他对父亲心存十二分的感激，因为正是父亲让他尝到了甜头。

至于另一件事，也就是父亲的见解不太高明的那件事，每个人生来都已具备了先决条件，自然而然都会无师自通，不管住在何处都是无所谓的。关于这些，父亲只给他提供过两点知识，至今他仍记忆犹新。一次父子两人出猎，尼克一枪打中了铁杉树上的一只红松鼠。松鼠受伤落地。尼克过去将它捡起，而它结结实实一口咬在了尼克的拇指肚上。

“你这个可恶的小bugger(2)！”尼克骂道，砰地把松鼠的脑袋在树上磕了一下，“看它把我咬的。”

父亲瞧了瞧伤口说：“用嘴把流出来的血吸干净，回家后涂点碘酒。”

“这个小bugger真可恶！”尼克说。

“你知道bugger是什么意思吗？”父亲问。

“这是我们小孩骂人用的。”

“bugger是指与兽类性交的人。”

“为什么和兽类性交？”尼克问。

“我也不知道。”父亲说，“这是一种十恶不赦的罪过。”

尼克因此胡思乱想了一通，心里觉得怪可怕的。他想到了各种各样的动物，觉得没有一种是具有吸引力的，好像不切合实际。除了另一件事父亲也发表过看法，这就是父亲直接传授给他的全部性方面的知识了。

一天上午，他在报上看见恩里科·卡罗素因mashing(3)罪而遭到了逮捕，于是便问父亲：“mashing是什么意思？”

“是一种十恶不赦的罪过。”父亲回答。

尼克的脑海里出现了那个著名男歌唱家的身影，见他用捣土豆泥的棒杵抡向一个漂亮女子（该女子长得像雪茄盒里安娜·海尔德(4)的画像），行为古怪、可怕。他心里怕得不得了，但他决定在自己长大后也要至少来那么一次mashing。

在总结这类事情时，父亲说自淫会导致眼盲、精神错乱和死亡，而嫖娼则会染上肮脏的花柳病，所以不应该胡来。再说说父亲的眼睛，那样的好眼力尼克从来都没有见过。尼克非常爱他，这种爱长久不衰。如今，过去的事如在眼前，他甚至能记得起横祸飞来之前早期的那段岁月，心里不由五味杂陈。如果用笔将其写出来，倒是可以吐出心中的块垒。对于许多事情他都是如此，以笔排忧愁。可是，要写出此事的来龙去脉，还为时过早。这会牵扯到很多人。于是，他决定暂时搁置不提。对于父亲的事他无能为力，往事他千思万想，不知想了有多少遍了。父亲死后，那个殡葬承办人为父亲整理遗容，干得一手好活，这情景仍清晰地留在他心里，其他的场景也历历在目，自己当时承担的责任他也记得很清楚。他对殡葬承办人说了些美言美语，后者听了极为高兴，面露得色。不过，父亲的遗容并不是由殡葬承办人定型的，殡葬承办人只不过描了几笔整理了一下而已，其艺术价值有待商榷。父亲的面容早已定型，此事由来已久。在近三年，定型的速度更为快速。这件事很有写头，只是许多事中人仍活在世上，不便动笔。

在人生的启蒙阶段，尼克的大课堂就是印第安营地后边的那片铁杉林。从他们家有一条小道通往林子，穿过林子就是农田，再走上一条弯弯曲曲的路经过荒地就可抵达印第安营地。此时，他真想再光着脚走一走那条小道，再感受感受。记得家宅后的铁杉林里松针铺地，倒地的树木已化为木头碎末，有的树杈遭电击裂开，长长的，一条一条挂在树上，看似标枪。小溪上搭着一根原木，过桥时一脚踏空，就会踏进沼泽地黑黑的淤泥里。翻过一道栅栏就出了林子，田间小道被太阳晒得发硬，处处可见草茬、酸模和天蕊花。左侧有一片泥塘水，是溪水泛滥时灌入造成的，在缓慢流动，那儿是喧鸻(5)的觅食地。瞭望棚就建在溪畔。粪棚里既有还冒着热气的新鲜牲口粪，也有陈粪，陈粪堆的顶端已经干得结成了块。再翻过一道栅栏，走完从粪棚到住宅那条坚硬、烫脚的小路，然后就是一条热烘烘的沙土路，一直通向林子，中间跨过一条小溪（这条小溪是有桥的），溪畔生长着猫尾草。夜间叉鱼，你可以把这猫尾草浸透煤油，点着当杰克灯(6)用。

大路擦着林子向左拐，蜿蜒翻过山头。进林子走的是一条宽宽的板岩土路，在树荫下倒是凉爽——此路之所以拓宽是为了便于将印第安人剥下的铁杉树皮外运。铁杉树皮堆积如山，排成一长列一长列的，上面搭了些铁杉树皮为盖，看上去像一座座房屋。剥光了皮的树身巨大、发黄，乱扔在伐木原场地，就这么躺在林子里烂掉，甚至连树梢都懒得砍，懒得烧。他们要的只是树皮，把树皮卖给博因城的制革厂。冬天湖上结冰，他们将树皮源源不断拖过湖去。树林逐年减少，荒地一年年扩大，空旷、炎热，没有树荫，杂草丛生。

不过，当时的森林还是挺大的，并且是原始森林，那些树都是蹿得很高了才分出枝杈。森林里没有灌木，走进去脚下踩的是棕色的松针地，洁净，富于弹性。大热天，森林里凉爽宜人，他们三个背靠一棵铁杉树的树身席地而坐——那棵树之粗，比两张床并起来还要宽，树梢间微风习习，斑驳的阳光洒进来已有了几分凉意。只听比利开口说了话：

“你又想要特鲁迪啦？”

“你想了吗，特鲁迪？”

“这个嘛……”

“咱们走开吧。”

“不行，就在这里吧。”

“可是，比利在……”

“我不在乎比利在跟前。他是我哥哥嘛。”




一番对话之后，三个人坐在那儿听见一只黑松鼠叫了一声，那松鼠在顶梢的枝头，眼睛看不见。他们等待着，等着松鼠再发出叫声。松鼠一叫就会翘尾巴，尼克看见动静就开枪。每天打猎，父亲只给他三发子弹。他有自己的猎枪，是单管的二十口径的猎枪，枪管非常长。

“那龟儿子一动不动。”比利说。

“你先开一枪吓吓它，尼基(7)。看见它一跳动，你就补一枪。”特鲁迪说。她说话很少说这么长的句子。

“我只有两发子弹了。”尼克说。

“那个龟儿子。”比利又骂了一声。

他们三个背靠大树坐着，一时谁也没说话。尼克觉得有点空落落的，心情却是高兴的。

“埃迪放出话，说哪天夜里他要来跟你妹妹多萝西睡上一觉。”

“什么？”

“他就是这么说的。”

特鲁迪点了点头。

“他的确想这么做。”她说。埃迪是她和比利的异母同父哥哥，今年十七岁。

“只要埃迪·吉尔比夜里敢来，哪怕是对多萝西说上一句话，你们知道我会把他怎么样吗？我会像这样一枪崩了他。”尼克说完枪口一斜，几乎连瞄准也没有就扣动了扳机，仿佛一枪打在了那个杂种埃迪·吉尔比的头上或肚子上，留下了一个能塞进去拳头的大窟窿。“就像这一个样。我会这么一枪崩了他。”

“他还是别来的好。”特鲁迪说完，把一只手伸进了尼克的口袋。

“最好叫他小心点。”比利说。

“他就喜欢吹牛。”特鲁迪一边说一边用手在尼克的口袋里摸索着。“你可别杀了他，那会惹上大祸的。”

“我会就这么一枪崩了他的。”尼克说。那架势就好像埃迪·吉尔比中枪倒地，胸口被打了个稀巴烂，而尼克得意扬扬地把一只脚踩在他身上。

“我还要剥下他的头皮。”他兴高采烈地说。

“别那样，”特鲁迪说，“那多脏呀。”

“我剥下他的头皮，送去给他的妈妈。”

“他妈妈早死了。”特鲁迪说，“求你别杀了他，尼基。看在我的面上，求你别杀他。”

“剥下他的头皮，把他的尸体让野狗吃。”

比利听了脸色沉了下来。“他最好还是小心点。”他闷闷不乐地说。

“野狗会把他撕成碎片的。”尼克说道。他为自己想象出的情景颇感得意——他把那个王八蛋剥了头皮，看着野狗将其撕成碎片，脸上面不改色。突然，他朝后一倒靠在了树身上，脖子被人搂得紧紧的。原来是特鲁迪搂住了他的脖子，让他透不过气来，嘴里哭叫着：“求你别杀他！求你别杀他！求你别杀他！别杀他！别杀他！别杀他！求你啦，尼基！求你啦，尼基！求你啦，尼基！”

“你这是怎么啦？”

“求你别杀他。”

“我非杀不可。”

“他只不过喜欢吹吹牛罢了。”

“那好吧，”尼基说，“他只要不来我家，我不杀他就是了。你松开手吧。”

“这样就好。”特鲁迪说，“你想不想现在干上一次呢？我现在有情绪了。”

“只要比利走开就行。”尼克说。他原来要杀埃迪·吉尔比，后来又饶他不死，一下子觉得自己成了个顶天立地的男子汉。

“你走开，比利。你怎么老缠在这里。快走开。”

“你个龟儿子，”比利说，“让人烦死啦。来这里到底是干什么的？来打猎还是干什么的？”

“你可以把枪拿走。还剩下一发子弹。”

“那好吧。我一定能打到一只又大又黑的松鼠。”

“过一会儿我喊你。”尼克说。




之后过了很长时间，比利仍没有露面。

“你看咱们会不会生出个孩子来？”特鲁迪蜷起两条棕色的腿，一脸的快活，小鸟依人地偎在他身上。尼克似有心事，显得心不在焉。

“我看不会的。”他说。

“生上一大堆孩子，那才好呢。”

这时，他们听到了比利的枪声。

“不知他打中了没有。”

“别操那份心了。”特鲁迪说。

说话间，就见比利穿过林子走了过来，肩上扛着猎枪，抓住一只黑松鼠的前爪把它拎在手里。

“瞧，”他说，“个头比猫还大。你们俩干完了吧？”

“你是在哪儿打到的？”

“就是在那边。看见它跳动，我就开了枪。”

“该回家去了。”尼克说。

“还不该呢。”特鲁迪说。

“我得赶回家吃晚饭呢。”

“那好吧。”

“明天还想来打猎吗？”

“好吧。”

“你们可以把松鼠拿回去。”

“好吧。”

“晚饭后还出来吗？”

“不了。”

“你感觉怎样？”

“好着呢。”

“那就好。”

“在我脸上亲亲。”特鲁迪说。

尼克正驾车行驶在公路上，天色在渐渐变黑。对于父亲的事，他已不再苦思冥想了。每当白日将近，他都会把父亲的事搁下不想。天擦黑的这个时候他沉浸在一个人的世界里，一胡思乱想就感到浑身不舒服。每至秋天或初春，慈父的身影都会频频出现于他的脑海。这种季节，小鹬飞临大草原，看得到玉米秆束成捆堆在那里，看得到波光粼粼的湖水，看得到马车，看得到大雁飞行，听得见大雁鸣叫，可以隐身于芦苇丛中打野鸭；记得在一个大雪天，一只老鹰从空中俯冲下来抓帆布篷里的诱鸟，拍翅飞起时，爪子缠在了帆布上——这一幕幕情景都会令他想起自己的父亲。只要走进空无一人的果园，只要踏上刚刚犁过的土地，只要步入小树林，只要攀上山丘或者踏过满地枯草，每当劈柴、取水时，每当走过磨坊、榨苹果汁的作坊、水坝，特别是看到篝火时，父亲的形象总会浮现在他眼前。他所住过的城市并非为他的父亲熟悉，因为他十五岁时便离开家门，没有再和父亲在一起生活。

天气寒冷时，父亲的胡子上会结霜，而热天他则大汗淋漓。他喜欢顶着太阳在地里干活，这倒不是说他不得不这样做，而是因为他喜欢干体力活。尼克则不然，他不喜欢干体力活。他爱父亲，却不爱闻他身上的气味。一次，父亲的一件内衣穿在身上太小了，让他穿，衣服上的气味叫他感到恶心，于是他脱下来投入溪水，上面压了两块石头，回家说衣服丢了。父亲让他穿这件衣服的时候，他就说过上面有气味，父亲却说是才洗过的（此话是真的）。他让父亲自己闻闻，父亲生气地拿过去闻了闻，强调说衣服是干干净净的，没有气味。他钓鱼回来不见了衣服，声称弄丢了。父亲嫌他撒谎，抽了他几鞭子。

事后，他坐在柴房里，敞开着门，给猎枪上了子弹，打开保险，眼睛望着在装了纱窗的阳台上看报的父亲，暗自思忖：“我一枪就可以送他见阎王，要了他的命。”最后，他气消了的时候，想起猎枪还是父亲给他买来的，不由心里感到一阵难过。随即，他摸黑走到了印第安人营地，想摆脱那股气味。家里，只有一个人的气味他爱闻，那就是妹妹的气味。其他的人，他能躲开就躲开。待他抽上了烟，嗅觉也随之变得迟钝了。这倒是件好事。捕鸟的猎犬有灵敏的嗅觉是好事，而人的嗅觉过于灵了不一定好。

“爸爸，你小的时候和印第安人一起去打猎是怎么打的呀？”

“我也说不好。”尼克吃了一惊。他耽于遐想，甚至没注意到儿子已经醒了，不由看了看坐在身旁座位上的儿子。他刚才感到自己是孤身一人，其实儿子就在跟前。不知这种状况持续了多长时间。“我们常常去打黑松鼠，一打就是一天。”他说道，“我父亲一天只给我三发子弹。他说这会叫我精于打猎，说小孩子乱开枪是成不了器的。跟我一道打猎的有个男孩叫比利·吉尔比以及他的妹妹特鲁迪。一年夏天，我们几乎天天都去。”

“印第安人起这样的名字，听上去怪怪的。”

“是呀，是有些。”尼克说。

“给我讲讲他们是怎样的人。”

“他们是奥吉布瓦族人，”尼克说，“是些非常好的人。”

“跟他们在一起，你觉得他们是怎么一种情况？”

“难以说得清。”尼克·亚当斯说。难道能跟儿子讲起她让他初尝到的欢愉吗？难道能讲那两条棕色的丰满的腿、平平的肚皮、坚挺的小乳房、搂得紧紧的胳膊、急速伸来伸去的舌头、单纯的眼以及味道甜美的嘴吗？难道能讲那种涩涩的、紧紧的，却又美美的、湿湿的（有点紧，有点疼，有点胀）感觉吗？那种感觉绵长，似乎永无止境，后来却戛然而止。有只大鸟在林子里飞起，飞起来就像日暮时分的猫头鹰，只不过当时仍是大白天，铁杉树的针叶贴在肚皮上。你只要去印第安人住过的地方，你便可以嗅到他们留下的气味——空酒瓶子以及嗡嗡叫的苍蝇，这些都压不住香草味、炊烟味以及一种类似刚刚剥下的貂皮散发出的气味。不管世人怎样取笑他们，不管他们如何没落，那种感觉是消除不了的。不管他们身上好闻还是难闻，不管他们结局如何，这种感觉依旧。他们结局如何不在话下，反正都免不了走下坡路——昔日状况良好，今日好景不再。

再说说打猎吧。你打下一只飞鸟，如同打下天上所有的飞鸟。飞鸟固然形形色色，飞翔的姿势也各不相同，但是打第一只鸟和打最后一只鸟，那种激动的心情是不变的。他接受这样的启蒙教育，得归功于他的父亲。

“你也许不会喜欢他们，”尼克对儿子说，“但以后你一定会的。”

“爷爷小的时候也和他们生活在一起，是不是？”

“是的。我曾经问他印第安人怎么样，他说他在印第安人中有许多朋友。”

“将来我是不是也和他们住在一起？”

“这我就不知道了。”尼克说，“这得取决于你。”

“我长到多大才能有杆猎枪自己去打猎？”

“如果小心别出事，十二岁就可以了吧。”

“真希望我现在就十二岁了。”

“你很快就会如愿的。”

“爷爷是怎样一个人？我记不清他了，只记得那次从法国回来，他给过我一支气枪和一面美国旗。他是怎样一个人呢？”

“很难形容。他是个神枪手，钓鱼钓得好，眼力极好。”

“难道他比你还棒吗？”

“他的枪法要神多了。他的父亲也是个打飞鸟的神枪手。”

“我敢打赌，他肯定不如你。”

“哦，还是他强些。他打枪出手快，百发百中。看他射击比看任何人都过瘾。对于我的枪法，他总是很不满意。”

“为什么咱们从来没有去给爷爷上过坟？”

“天各一方，住的地方距离太远。”

“在法国这就不是个问题。法国人都是去上坟的。我觉得应该去给爷爷上上坟。”

“找个时间去吧。”

“但愿咱们不会住得天各一方，那样你死了以后，弄得我给你上不了坟。”

“此事可以从长计议。”

“你不觉得家里人死了都应该埋在一个比较方便的地方吗？可以埋在法国嘛。那该多好呀。”

“我不想被埋在法国。”尼克说。

“哦，那就在美国国内找块方便的墓地吧。能不能都埋在牧场上呢？”

“这想法不错。”

“这样，在去牧场的路上，我就可以顺便为爷爷上坟了。”

“你想得挺周到的。”

“哦，给爷爷连一次坟也没上过，总觉得不舒服。”

“会去的，”尼克说，“放心吧，咱们一定去。”

海上的一趟生意


哈瓦那的清晨，流浪汉仍躺在墙根睡大觉，送冰车尚未把酒吧需要的冰块送去——此时此刻的状况你想象得出来吗？哦，当时我们从码头穿过广场去旧金山明珠咖啡馆喝咖啡，只看见一个乞丐已经醒了，正在泉眼那儿饮水。可是，待我们走进咖啡馆坐定，却见那些人当中已经有三个在等我们了。

我们落座后，他们当中的一个走了过来。

“怎么样？”他问道。

“我无能为力。”我告诉他说，“我倒是很想帮这个忙，可我昨夜就告诉你们了，说过我无法从命。”

“你可以开个价嘛。”

“这跟价钱不着边，而是我办不到。情况就是如此。”

另外的两个早已走了过来，他们几个站在那里，面露愁容。他们看上去都是挺不错的人，能帮忙我还是愿意出手相助的。

“每个人给你一千块。”一个操一口流利英语的人说。

“请别这么说话，让我觉得自己龌龊。”我说道，“我说的是实话，的确帮不上忙。”

“将来时局变了，这会对你很有好处的。”

“这我知道。我深表同情，只是此忙实在帮不上。”

“为什么？”

“我得靠这条船糊口。没有了船，就没有了口粮。”

“有钱在口袋里，可以再买一条嘛。”

“进了监狱就买不成了。”

他们一定以为费些口舌还是可以把我说得回心转意的，只听那位继续说道：

“你将拿到三千块钱，以后有你的好日子过的。目前的局势是长不了的。”

“听着，”我说，“我不管这儿谁当总统，只认定一点：凡是会说话的，绝不送到美国去。”

“你的意思是我们会把此事讲出去？”他们当中一个一直没开口的人说道，露出一脸的怒容。

“我指的是任何会说话的。”

“你以为我们是长舌头(1)吗？”

“没那个意思。”

“你知道长舌头(2)是什么意思吗？”

“知道，指的是舌头很长的人。”

“你知道我们怎样对付这类人吗？”

“不必撂狠话。”我说，“是你们找我帮忙，又不是我求你们。”

“闭上你的嘴，潘乔。”先前说话的那个呵斥这位怒容满面的说。

“他说咱们会把此事讲出去。”潘乔说。

“听着，”我说道，“我说的是：凡是会说话的，绝不送到美国去。装在坛子里的酒不会说话。酒坛子也不会说话。还有许多东西都不会说话。唯独人会说话。”

“你说中国人会不会说话？”潘乔恶声恶气地问。

“会，可是我听不懂。”我回答。

“如此看来，你是不答应啦？”

“昨夜已直言相告，说过难以从命。”

“你不会讲出去吧？”潘乔说。

他可能是产生了误解，才窝了一肚子的火。另外，希望变成了失望，这大概也是叫他生气的原因。对于他的话，我甚至懒得回答。

“你该不会是个长舌头(3)吧？”他问道，语气仍恶狠狠的。

“我想不会是的。”

“怎么？这是威胁吗？”

“听着，”我说道，“大清早的，别这么凶嘛。我相信你割断过很多人的喉咙。我咖啡都没有喝呢，饶了我吧。”

“这么说，你认为我割断过很多人的喉咙？”

“算啦，”我说道，“我才不管你割谁的喉咙呢。生意归生意，你能不能别发火？”

“我现在憋了一肚子火，”他说，“真想杀了你。”

“哈，得啦，”我说道，“别把话说过了头。”

“到此为止，潘乔。”最先说话的那个喝止道。随后他又对我说，“很遗憾。我还是希望你能送送我们。”

“我也很遗憾，恕难从命。”

那三个人拂袖而去，朝着门外走去，我目送着他们。他们看上去是几个挺不错的年轻人，穿着挺不错的衣服，都没有戴帽子，似乎很有钱。至少，他们说起话像是很有钱，操一口只有有钱的古巴人才会讲的流利英语。

他们当中有两个像是兄弟，再一个就是潘乔。潘乔个头稍高，派头跟另两位相似，细条条的身材，衣着考究，头发亮光光的。他说话不饶人，可我觉得他并非一个难缠的人，可能是情绪太激动才出言不逊。

他们出了门向右拐，这时我看见一辆窗户紧闭的汽车从广场冲了过来。随后，咖啡馆的一块窗户玻璃砰的一声碎了，一颗子弹射进来，打在右首靠墙放的酒柜上的一排酒瓶上。接着又听见啪啪啪几声枪响，墙根的那些酒瓶子被打得碎片乱飞。

我一个箭步躲到了左边的吧台后面，从那儿可以从吧台后探头向外望。那辆汽车已经停了下来，有两个家伙蹲下身子躲在车后，一个手持汤普森枪，另一个拿的是锯短了的自动式猎枪。手持汤普森枪的是个黑人，另一个身穿白颜色的司机工作服。

刚从咖啡馆出去的年轻人中，有一个摊开四肢，面朝下扑倒在人行道上，就在那扇被子弹击中的大窗户的跟前。另外的两个躲到了一辆停放在隔壁丘纳德酒吧门前的“热带啤酒”送冰车后。拉车的马，一匹中弹后连着马具倒在了地上，四蹄乱蹬，另一匹死命挣扎，想挣脱辕架。

一位年轻人从车尾开枪还击，子弹打在人行道的路面上，然后弹起。手持汤普森枪的黑人匍匐在地，脸几乎都贴到了路面上，贴着地面给马车尾部送去了一梭子子弹，车后有个年轻人应声倒在人行道上，脑袋刚好伸出人行道的边缘。他双手抱头躺在那儿。那个拿猎枪的司机朝他开了几枪，黑人趁机给弹仓里又装满了子弹，随后射出去一阵弹雨，看得见子弹倾泻在路面上，像是银水四溅。

另一个年轻人拽住中弹的那个，将他拖回马车后。我看见黑人把脸又贴到地面准备扫射。就在这时，只见潘乔从马车后冲出，蹿到了那匹没有倒下去的马的背后。随即，他又从那儿闪出，脸色惨白如纸，双手握紧一支大型号的鲁格尔手枪，一枪射中了那个司机。接着，他走上前去对着黑人开枪，两颗子弹从黑人的头顶飞过，还有一颗打低了。

有一枪打在了汽车轮胎上，只见轮胎里的气扑哧扑哧外泄，把路面上的尘土都吹了起来，升起一团尘云。他走到距离黑人有十英尺远的地方，后者用汤普森枪给了他一枪，打在了他的肚子上。那肯定是黑人的最后一颗子弹了，因为我看见他射击后就把枪扔了。潘乔扑通一屁股坐在了地上，身子向前一栽。他抓住鲁格尔手枪不松手，还试图直起身来，然而却连头也抬不起来了。黑人捡起司机倒地时滚落到汽车轮子旁的猎枪，一枪就把潘乔的脑袋崩掉了半个。好一个黑人！

见跟前有瓶开了瓶的酒，我拿起来就喝了一口，也不顾喝的是什么酒。刚才那一幕叫我觉得心里很不舒服。从吧台后边我溜进厅堂后面的厨房，再从那儿出去，一溜烟跑了。我擦着广场的边绕着走，对于咖啡馆门前迅速聚集的人群甚至回头看也没看一眼，穿过码头的大门，上了码头，然后登上了船。

租船的那个人已在船上等候了。我把发生的事情跟他讲了讲。

“埃迪在哪儿？”租船人约翰逊问我。

“枪战一开始，我就再也没见过他。”

“你看他会不会被打中呢？”

“绝对不会。告诉你，射进咖啡馆里的子弹全都打在了酒柜上。当时汽车是从他们身后开过来的，第一个是在外边的窗户前中弹的。枪手冲过来的角度就像这样……”

“你像是对什么都很有把握似的。”他说。

“我在现场看着呢。”我说道。

说到这里，我一抬头见埃迪从码头过来了，个头显得比以前高了些，样子也邋遢了些。看他走路的姿势，像是全身的骨头都散了架似的。

“他来了。”

他在清晨历来无精打采，而此刻却是一副惨象。

“你到哪儿了？”我问他。

“在地上趴着呢。”

“都看见了吗？”约翰逊问他。

“还是别提了吧，约翰逊先生，”埃迪说，“光想一想就让人感到不舒服。”

“最好喝上一杯压压惊。”约翰逊对他说完，又问我道：“怎么样，该出发了吧？”

“你决定吧。”

“今天天气怎么样？”

“跟昨天一样。也许会好一些。”

“那咱就走吧。”

“好的。鱼饵一拿来就出发。”

我们驾驶着这条船到河里钓了三个星期的鱼。他事先倒是给过我一百块钱到领事馆办理各种手续、买食物和加油，除此之外再也没见他拿出过一分钱。船上乱七八糟的杂费由我出，他则每天花三十五块钱的租船费。他夜里在一家旅馆住宿，早晨到船上来。租船是由埃迪牵的线，于是我还得把他也带上，一天付给他四块钱的辛苦费。

“我得给船加些油。”我对约翰逊说。

“好的。”

“加油需要用些钱。”

“多少？”

“一加仑是两毛八。怎么也需要加四十加仑的油。总共十一块零两毛钱。”

他掏出了十五块钱。

“剩下的钱是不是需要买些啤酒和冰块？”我问他。

“好的。”他说，“从我的欠账里扣除就是了。”

我心想，让他欠三个星期的账，时间是长了些，可他既然能还得清，又有什么关系呢？按理，每个星期都应该清账的。可是我却让他欠一个月后再还钱。我是有些失算，不过先拿到一些租钱也还是叫人高兴的。只是最近几天他令我有些不安，不过我不愿把心里的想法说出去，怕把事情弄僵。如果他付得起钱，就叫他租吧，租的时间越长越好。

“来一瓶啤酒吧？”他打开啤酒箱问我。

“不了。谢谢。”

就在这时，去买鱼饵的黑人回来了，从码头上走了过来。我告诉埃迪准备解缆起航。

等到买鱼饵的黑人上了船，我们就启航，驶出了港口。黑人用作鱼饵的是几条鲭鱼，先把鱼钩从鱼的嘴里穿过鱼鳃，再将鱼钩从鱼身的一侧扎入，从另一侧取出，把合拢的鱼嘴绑在铁丝导线上，将鱼钩也绑牢以避免脱钩，如此一来，鱼饵就能保持平稳，不至于打旋。

他是个真正的黑透了的黑人，脑子够用，却老是郁郁寡欢，衬衣里的脖子上挂着一串伏都教(4)的念珠，头戴一顶旧草帽。他在船上只喜欢干两件事：睡觉和看报。不过，他做得一手好鱼饵，动作很麻利。

“这种做鱼饵的活你干不了吗，船长？”约翰逊问我。

“干得了，先生。”

“那你为什么还要弄个黑人来？”

“等到大鱼群出现了，你就知道为什么了。”我告诉他。

“此话怎讲？”

“这个黑人的手脚比我快。”

“埃迪干不了吗？”

“干不了，先生。”

“我觉得这是一笔没有必要的花销。”他一天付给黑人一块钱，黑人拿上钱夜夜都去跳伦巴舞(5)。看得出，此时他已困意蒙了。

“雇他来是有必要的。”我说。

说话间，我们的船已经驶过了停泊在卡巴纳斯码头前的那些配有鱼舱的渔船，驶过了那些停下来在岬角旁的石头海床上捕捉双色笛鲷(6)的小艇。我掌舵，将船开向海湾深处，那儿远看似一条黑线。埃迪把两个大大的引料(7)抛了出去，黑人已给三根钓竿装好了鱼饵。

湾流接近完美，行驶到跟前时，看得见湾流里的水几乎呈紫色，漩涡很多。从东边吹来轻轻的海风。我们的船惊起了不少飞鱼，有的个头大得飞起来像架飞机，像是一幅林德伯格(8)驾机飞越大西洋的画面。

大个头飞鱼的出现是个好兆头。放眼望去，可以看到一小簇一小簇发蔫发黄的马尾藻，说明湾流的主流已近在眼前。前方有海鸟在追食一群小金枪鱼。不时有鱼儿跃出水面——都是些小鱼，每条只有两三磅重。

“你随时都可以放入钓竿了。”我对约翰逊说。

于是，他系好保险带和保险绳，将那根大钓竿放进了水里——钓竿上装有耐寒卷轴，卷轴上缠着六百码长的三十六号鱼线。我回头看看，见他下的鱼饵状况良好，随着海波一上一下的，那两个引料也时沉时浮。船速不快不慢，差不多刚好。我转了一下舵盘，将它开进了湾流。

“你把钓竿插在椅子上的插座里，”我对他说，“不用把钓竿沉甸甸地握在手里。鱼线不要扯紧，这样鱼上钩时可以让它拖着走。否则，上钩的鱼一使劲，会把你拉进海里的。”

每天我都要重复这些话，但我不厌其烦。租船钓鱼的客人，五十个人里，恐怕只有一个是懂行的。即便是懂行的，也会脑子糊涂，买的鱼线不够结实，钓到大鱼就吃不消了。

“天气怎么样？”他问我。

“好得不能再好了。”我告诉他说。此话不虚，天气的确不错。

我把舵盘交给了黑人，让他把船沿着湾流的边朝东开。交代完，我回到了约翰逊身边，见他正坐在那儿观鱼饵随波沉浮。

“需要我再放入一根钓竿吗？”我问他。

“我看不需要了。”他说，“我喜欢自己做，自己钓住鱼，自己和它搏斗，自己将它擒到手。”

“那好吧。”我说道，“需要不需要埃迪下钓竿？鱼上了钩再交给你，由你来钓它上来。”

“不需要。”他说，“一根钓竿就够了。”

“那好吧。”

黑人驾着船仍在湾流外行驶，我一看，原来是他在上流不远处发现了一大群飞鱼。回头望去，只见哈瓦那在阳光下显得颇为壮观，一艘轮船正出了港口驶过岬角。

“看来你今天能钓到大鱼放手一搏了，约翰逊先生。”我说道。

“也该钓到了。”他说，“咱们钓鱼有多长时间了？”

“到今天正好三个星期。”

“时间够长的了。”

“这些鱼很滑稽。”我说道，“你怎么盼它们都不来。可是，不来则已，一来就是一大片，而且持续不断。如果现在不见个影子，那恐怕就不来了。夜里月光好，湾流也不错，还会有好风，按说它们会来的。”

“刚来的时候，见过一些小鱼呢。”

“是的。”我说道，“正如我所言，小鱼少了，不再出现了，接着就该大鱼登场了。”

“你们当船长的再怎么都一样。鱼群来早来晚，风向顺不顺，月光亮不亮，你们照样是收钱的。”

“糟糕的是，”我说道，“鱼群不是来得太早，就是来得太晚，风向也常常不对劲。遇上一个顺风顺水的好日子，却偏偏没有租客来。”

“你觉得今天是个好日子吗？”

“这个嘛，”我说道，“反正我今天够忙活了。我敢说也会叫你忙个够。”

“但愿如此。”他说。

接下来，我们静下心来守候。埃迪到了船头那儿，一歪身子躺下了。我则直直站在那儿观察鱼情。黑人连连打盹，昏昏欲睡，我还得用眼睛瞅着他。我敢说，这几个夜晚他没少折腾。

“船长，能不能给我拿瓶啤酒来？”约翰逊问我。

“好的，先生。”我边说边伸手从冰块下给他取了瓶冰镇啤酒。

“你也喝一瓶吧？”他问道。

“不了，先生。”我回答说，“晚上再喝吧。”

我打开啤酒递给他。就在这时，我看见一条棕褐色的大鱼朝着做鱼饵用的鲭鱼冲了过来，头和肩露出水面，背上的鱼鳍像根长矛，比人的胳膊还长，腰身圆鼓鼓，看上去就像是锯木厂的原木。

“把渔线松开！”我吼了一声。

“它还没有上钩呢。”约翰逊说。

“那就等一等。”

大鱼是从深水里蹿出来的，一口没有咬住鲭鱼。我心里有数，知道它不会甘心，还会拐回来的。

“做好准备，它一咬钩，就放线。”

接下来，我瞧见大鱼在水下从背后摸了上来。可以看见它的鱼鳍张开，像是紫色的翅膀，棕褐色的身子上有着紫色的条纹。它看上去像是一艘潜水艇，鱼鳍的顶梢突出水面，划破层层碧波。随即，它冲到了鱼饵的后边，它的“长矛”也露了出来，像是还抖了抖水。

“让它把鱼钩咬死。”我说道。

约翰逊把手从卷轴上拿开，卷轴飞快地开始放线。那条大马林鱼一转身没入水里。当它侧身向海岸那边快速游去时，整个儿一览无余，银光闪闪的。

“把线稍微收紧一些，”我说，“不要收得太多。”

他用卷轴开始收鱼线。

“不要收得太多。”我说。看得见鱼线斜着在绷紧。

“好，该收紧了，让它知道厉害。”我说，“给它点颜色瞧瞧。让它好好跳一跳。”

约翰逊收了收鱼线，又回来查看钓竿的情况。

“叫它吃点苦头。”我说道，“让钩子钩紧它，多拉几下。”

他拉鱼钩，一连拉了好几次。此时，钓竿向下弯，卷轴开始发出吱扭吱扭的响声。哗的一声，大鱼一跃跃到了空中，阳光下通体银光闪闪，落入水里时发出巨大的声响，像是一匹马被人推下了悬崖坠地时发出的声音。

“把线松一些。”我吩咐道。

“它跑了。”约翰逊说。

“哪里的话。”我说道，“你赶快把线放松些就是了。”

随后便见鱼线松了些。大鱼再次跃出水面时，是在船的后面，接着便向远处游去。不一会儿，它又出水了，溅得白浪滚滚。可以看见，鱼钩钩住了它的腮帮子。它身上的条纹清晰可见。多么棒的一条鱼，此刻全身显银色带有紫色条纹，圆滚滚像根原木。

“它跑啦。”约翰逊说。鱼线呈松弛状态。

“收线吧。”我说。“钩子钩得紧紧的。开足马力，把船朝前开！”后一句话是喊给黑人听的。

大鱼又露出水面一两次，直撅撅的像根木柱，排山倒海向我们冲来，每次落入水里时，溅起老高的水柱。鱼线被扯紧，只见它又朝着岸边游去，一路上身子翻来翻去。

“它要溜之大吉了。”我说，“只要不脱钩，就追得上它。把渔线放开，咱们有的是鱼线。”

马林鱼管自向西北方向游去——大个头的鱼都是这么个劲，也不顾身上还有鱼钩呢。它一蹿就是老远，弄得浪花四溅，像是一艘快艇行驶在大海上。我们驾船追去。我让船打了个转，使它处于船尾旁边的位置（此时已由我掌舵），一边冲着约翰逊大喊大叫，让他别拖得太紧，赶快收线。突然，只见钓竿猛地一弹，鱼线一下子松了。鱼线在水里有一股拉力，变松了的时候，一般是看不出来的。可是我却看出来了。

“这次它真跑了。”我说道。大鱼一蹦一蹿的，不停地跳跃前进，直至从视野里消失。没说的，这是一条非常棒的鱼。

“我仍能感觉得到它的拉力呀。”约翰逊说。

“那是因为鱼线本身的重量而产生的。”

“卷轴几乎转动不了了。也许它已经死了吧。”

“你睁眼瞧瞧嘛，”我说，“它活蹦乱跳的。”只见大鱼在半英里开外乱扑腾，掀起冲天的浪花。

我试了试约翰逊的卷轴，发现他把螺丝拧得太紧，线都扯不出来了，有扯断的危险。

“我不是说过，叫你别扯得太紧吗？”

“它在一个劲朝外拉呢。”

“朝外拉又怎么样？”

“所以我就拧紧了呀。”

“听着，”我说道，“鱼一上钩，如果你不把线放松，就会被扯断的。光靠鱼线是拉不住大鱼的。它们拉，你就得放。鱼线是不能扯得太紧的。靠打鱼为生的渔民用的是鱼叉绳，即便如此也不敢扯得太紧。咱们钓鱼的，钓上的大鱼一旦扯着线跑，就只能驾着船跟在屁股后面追，等到它们跑不动了就会停下来，那时你再扯紧鱼线，把渔线朝回收。”

“这么说，假如鱼线不断，便可以将其捕获吗？”

“很有可能。”

“它总不能一直撑下去吧？”

“事情很难说。战斗一开始，非得等它挣扎不动了，才万事皆休。”

“好。这次非得抓住一条不可。”

“你得先把卷轴上的线整理好。”我告诉他说。

我们钩上了大鱼，又失去了它，自始至终都没有把埃迪吵醒。此时他却醒了，来到了船尾。

“发生什么事啦？”他问道。

埃迪以前不酗酒，在船上是个好帮手，而今他屁用都不顶。我瞧了一眼他的熊样：高个子，脸颊凹陷，耷拉着嘴唇，眼角沾着白色眼屎，头发被太阳晒得没有了色泽。我知道他一醒来，就会犯酒瘾的。

“你喝瓶啤酒吧。”我对他说。他毫不客气地从箱子里取出一瓶，一饮而尽。

“哦，约翰逊先生，”他说道，“我看我还是继续睡我的觉吧。谢谢你的啤酒，先生。”

埃迪真是麻木不仁。我们钓上钓不上鱼他根本不往心里去。

中午时分，我们又钓上一条，结果又溜掉了。只见这条大鱼一挣扎甩掉了钓钩，把钓钩甩到空中有三十英尺高的地方。

“这次又是哪个地方出岔了？”约翰逊问。

“没出岔子。”我说，“是它一甩把钓钩甩掉了。”

“约翰逊先生，”一觉醒来，又喝了瓶啤酒的埃迪说道，“约翰逊先生，只怪你运气不佳。也许，在情场上你能交上好运呢。约翰逊先生，今晚咱们出去玩玩怎么样？”说完，他回去，倒头又睡了。

大约在下午四点钟，我们逆着湾流返航，渐渐靠近岸边，湾流之水犹如驱动水磨的水一样哗哗流淌，太阳晒在我们的脊背上。就在这时，一条马林鱼咬上了约翰逊的鱼饵，黑黑的颜色，个头之大我一辈子都没有见到过。在这之前，我们用毛鱿鱼做饵钓到了四条小金枪鱼，黑人拿其中的一条装在钓钩上当鱼饵，拖在船后沉沉的，但是却掀起来大大的浪花。

约翰逊老是握着钓竿，胳膊都累酸了，于是干脆取掉卷轴套，这样就能把钓竿放在膝上了。由于鱼饵大，拖力大，他两手拽卷轴的线，累得不得了，趁我不注意把螺栓拧紧了。这种情况我一直没发现。我看着他拿钓竿的样子心里不舒服，可是又不愿对他唠叨个没完。再说，只要螺栓没拧紧，必要时就可以放线，不会出危险的。只不过这样钓鱼未免有些吊儿郎当了。

当时我在掌舵，驾船行驶在湾流的边缘，到了老水泥厂对面的海域，这里的水很深，紧靠岸边，漩涡一个接一个，小鱼特别多。突然，海水哗的一声四溅开去，像爆炸了一颗深水炸弹。接着，一条黑色的马林鱼出现了，露出了鱼鳍、鱼眼，露出了一个血盆大口和一个巨大无比的紫黑色脑袋。

它背上的鱼鳍完全露出了水面，看上去有一艘帆船那么高。它一甩镰刀状的尾巴，朝着金枪鱼饵扑了过来。尖尖的鱼嘴像棒球棒，向上噘起，撕咬金枪鱼时，简直把海水都劈成了两半。它通体紫黑色，眼睛有碗口般大。它简直就是一个巨无霸。我敢打赌，它准有一千磅重。

我大喊一声，让约翰逊赶快放线。可是，未等我话出口，就见约翰逊离了椅子，飞到了半空，就好像被吊车吊起来了一样。刹那间，他紧抓住钓竿不松手，钓竿弯得像一张弓，结果钓竿的柄戳在了他的肚子上，钓竿上的配件纷纷落水。

都怪他把螺丝拧得太紧，大鱼袭来，将他从椅子上吊起，他如何能顶得住呢。结果，钓竿柄别在了他的腿下，而钓竿扫过膝盖，要是他没有把卷轴套取掉，恐怕连他本人也被扯进大海里了。

我关掉引擎，回到船尾看究竟，只见他捂着肚子上被钓竿柄击打过的地方。

“看来今天的戏演完了。”我说道。

“那是什么玩意儿？”他问我。

“是条黑色马林鱼。”我说。

“怎么成了这样？”

“咱们把账算一下吧。”我说，“卷轴钱是两百五十块。按现在的价钱更高哩。钓竿花掉我五十五块。三十六号鱼线总共是六百码差一点。”

这时，埃迪拍了拍他的背说：“约翰逊先生，你的运气不好呀。我活了这么大，从没见过这种怪事。”

“别说风凉话，你这个酒鬼。”我呵斥道。

“听我说，约翰逊先生，”埃迪自管自地说了下去，“这种怪事可是百年不遇呀，从来都没有看到过。”

“我被大鱼拖住了，你说我该如何是好？”约翰逊说。

“跟鱼搏斗，这不正是你想要的嘛。”我开口说道，语气中有许多的懊恼。

“它的个头太大了。”约翰逊说，“哎，跟它搏斗，有我的苦头吃的。”

“实不相瞒，”我说道，“这么大的鱼，弄不好会要你的命的。”

“这种大鱼也是有人抓住的。”

“那可是些懂行的人呀。而且，别以为他们会少吃苦头。”

“我见过一幅照片，上面有个女孩抓住了一条大鱼。”

“此事不虚。”我说，“但那还属于钓鱼一类——让大鱼吞下鱼饵，拉出它的肠子肚子，结果它就浮上来死去了。我所说的是让鱼钩钩在鱼嘴上，一路拖着它走。”

“哦，”约翰逊说道，“鱼的个头太大。抓这种鱼享受不到乐趣，何必要自找苦吃呢？”

“说得好，约翰逊先生。”埃迪在一旁说，“抓这种鱼享受不到乐趣，何必要自找苦吃呢？这是大实话，约翰逊先生。你算说到点子上了。抓这种鱼享受不到乐趣，何必要自找苦吃呢？”

见了刚才的场面，我此刻仍余悸未消，再加上损失了钓具，心里极不畅快，对于他们的话根本听不进去，于是吩咐黑人把船开到岬角那儿去。我一句话也没说，而他们俩也干坐在那儿——埃迪坐在椅子上，手里拎着瓶酒，约翰逊也拎着瓶酒。

“船长，”过了一会儿，约翰逊说道，“能不能给我调杯酒——威士忌加苏打水？”

我给他调了一杯，一声未吭，然后给我自己来了杯没掺水的。我心里暗想，这个约翰逊没出息，钓鱼钓了十五天，好不容易遇上一条别人一年都难得一见的大鱼，却让它跑了，连我整套的钓具也不见了，出尽了洋相，但他可好，竟然自得其乐地坐在那儿和一个酒鬼推杯换盏呢。

船靠了码头，黑人仍逗留不去。

我问约翰逊：“明天还去不去？”

“我看就算啦。”约翰逊说，“这样的钓法揪心揪肺的。”

“能不能付钱让这位黑人走？”

“该付给他多少钱？”

“一块钱。如果想给小费也可以。”

约翰逊给了黑人一块钱的工钱和两枚二十分的古巴币的小费。

“这是什么钱？”黑人拿着两枚硬币问我。

“是小费。”我用西班牙语告诉他，“你的活儿干完了。这是他的一点小意思。”

“明天就不来了吗？”

“不用来了。”

黑人收拾起他的用来捆扎鱼饵的麻线团和墨镜，戴上草帽，连声招呼也不打就走了。他虽然是个黑人，却根本不把我们放在眼里。

“你打算何时结账，约翰逊先生？”我启口问道。

“明天上午我到银行去，”约翰逊说，“咱们明天下午结吧。”

“你知道该是多少天吗？”

“十五天呗。”

“不对。加上今天，有十六天，再算上两头各一天，总共十八天。另外还有今天损失的钓竿、卷轴和鱼线。”

“钓具的钱不该我出。”

“错了，先生。是你弄丢的，就该你出。”

“每天的租赁费我都付清了。就不该再出了。”

“错了，先生。”我说道，“假如是鱼弄坏的，就不怪你，那会是另一码子事。这次只怪你粗心大意，才导致损失掉了整套的钓具。”

“那是大鱼把它硬从我手里拖走的。”

“还不是因为你把螺丝拧紧了，没有把鱼竿放在插座上。”

“你这样乱收费，好没有情由。”

“如果你租了辆汽车，汽车掉下了悬崖。你说你该不该赔偿损失？”

“如果我坐在车里，就不该赔偿。”约翰逊说。

“说得妙，约翰逊先生。”埃迪喝彩道，“你明白其中的意思了吗，船长？如果他在车里，那就是车毁人亡。他就不用赔偿了。说得真妙！”

我没搭理这个酒鬼。“对于钓竿、卷轴和鱼线的损失，你该付两百九十五块钱。”我对约翰逊说。

“哦，这不合情理哟。”他说，“不过，你既然这么说，咱们各让一点怎么样？”

“再怎么你付的钱也不能少于三百六十块。鱼线的钱就不收你的了。那么大的鱼自然会把线全都拖走，责任不在于你。如果不是个酒鬼在这儿，而是别人，就一定会告诉你我对你是极为公道的。我知道这笔钱似乎是很大的数目，可我买钓具也花了大笔的钱呢。不舍得花钱买最好的钓具，哪能惬意地钓鱼。”

“约翰逊先生，他说我是个酒鬼，也许我就是酒鬼。不过，我得说他是公道的，既公道又合情理。”埃迪在一旁帮腔说。

“我就不再争了。”约翰逊最后说道，“我付钱就是了——即便我并不同意你的说法。总共十八天，每天船租三十五块，再加上两百九十五块的钓具钱。”

“你付过一百块了。”我说道，“我把花费列一张清单，吃剩下的食物不算在内。来回路上的用度得由你掏腰包。”

“这也算合理。”约翰逊说。

“实不相瞒，约翰逊先生，”埃迪说道，“你要是知道他对外乡人要价要得有多狠，就会明白这不仅仅是合理了。你知道这算什么吗？这是特殊待遇！船长待你亲如爹娘。”

“我明天去银行一趟，下午来结账，后天乘船离开。”

“你可以和我们一起回去，省一张船票。”

“不了，”他说，“乘轮船走能节省些时间。”

“那好吧。”我说道，“一起干一杯怎么样？”

“好的。”约翰逊说，“你现在对我心里还有气吗？”

“哪能有气呢，先生。”我说道。

随后，我们三个坐在船尾觥筹交错，一道喝了一通加了苏打水的威士忌。

次日，我在船上忙活了一上午，给主机加了油，又干了些七零八碎的活。中午时分，我去住宅区的一家中餐馆进餐——在那儿花四毛钱就能美美吃上一顿。吃完饭，我买了些东西带回家给妻子和三个女儿。其中包括香水、几把扇子和两个高高的发梳。采购完，我拐进多诺万酒馆喝了杯啤酒，跟老板聊了一会，然后徒步走回旧金山码头，一路上又进了三四家酒馆饮酒。在丘纳德酒吧遇见弗兰基，请他喝了几杯，然后心情愉悦地回到船上。上了船，我发现口袋里只剩下了四毛钱。回船上时，弗兰基也跟来了，于是我们两人坐在那儿等约翰逊。我从冰块箱子里取出几瓶冰镇酒，和弗兰基一道慢斟慢饮。

埃迪一夜没露面，白天一天也没见他的影子。不过我知道，一旦他无法再赊账，早晚都会来的。多诺万告诉我，说埃迪和约翰逊昨晚到他的酒馆坐了一会儿，埃迪请客喝酒还赊了账。我和弗兰基继续等他们，我心里升起了疑团，怀疑约翰逊不会来了。我曾经在码头上留过话，说见到他就让他来船上等我。可码头上的人说他一直未来。我却仍未死心，想着他大概昨夜回旅馆晚了，今天恐怕到中午才会起床。银行下午三点半关门。我们眼看着航班都起飞了。五点半的时候，我已经高兴不起来了，心里急得直打鼓。

到了六点钟，我打发弗兰基到旅馆去看他在不在。我仍心存侥幸，觉得他很可能出去找乐子去了，要不然就是在旅馆里，身体不舒服卧在床上呢。我等啊等，等到很晚的时候。我等得心急火燎，因为他还欠我八百二十五块钱呢。

弗兰基去了大约有半个多小时。他回来时，只见他步履匆匆，还一个劲地摇着头。

“他搭乘航班走了。”他说。

好呀，真是把事情做绝了。领事馆已关门，而我身上只有四毛钱。估计航班此时已到了迈阿密了。我连发封电报的钱都没有了。约翰逊先生真是把我逼上了绝路。都怪我疏忽大意了。我早应该提防着。

“事已至此，”我对弗兰基说，“就不管它了，咱们干一杯，喝上一杯冰镇啤酒。这还是约翰逊先生掏钱买的呢。”总共还剩下三瓶啤酒，都是“热带”牌的。

弗兰基和我一样觉得心里发堵。我也不知道他是否真的心里不痛快，但从表面看的确如此。他不时拍我的脊背，把头摇来摇去的。

现实很清楚：我已经一贫如洗。五百三十块钱的租船费已化为泡影。要重新购置钓具，没有三百五十块是绝对不行的。我心想，在码头周围晃悠的帮仔，其中有几个得知此事，不知会多高兴呢。那些“海螺”(9)一定会乐得不得了。就在昨天，只要送三个外国人去基斯群岛，就可以赚三千块钱，可我却一口回绝了。其实，不一定去基斯群岛，只要把他们送出这个国家即可。

这下可好了。接下来该怎么办呢？去贩运一趟酒吧，得有钱先把酒买下，再说现在贩运酒无利可图。如今，城里酒馆遍地开花，买酒的人却寥若晨星。回家去吧，身无分文。留下来吧，一个夏天都得饿肚子，真是上天无路入地无门。更惨的是，一家人还等着我养活呢。出入关口的费用来的时候交过了。代理人一般都是预先收取费用，然后帮你进关和出关。天呀，我就连给船加油的钱也没有了。真是到了山穷水尽的地步。约翰逊先生真缺德！

“得找个贩运的活儿，弗兰基，”我说，“挣点钱以解燃眉之急。”

“我想想办法看。”弗兰基说。他老在岸边转悠，平时干些零活，耳朵聋得厉害，一到晚上就酗酒。不过，比他更为忠诚，比他心眼更好的人，你恐怕见都没见过。自从我一来此地谋生，就跟他认识了，他多次帮过我装货。后来我有了游艇，做起租船的生意，招揽顾客来古巴钓鱼，常在码头和咖啡馆见到他。他好像是个哑巴，见人不说话，而是莞尔一笑——其实，那是因为他耳朵聋的缘故。

“贩运什么货物都可以？”弗兰基问。

“是的。”我说，“我现在不能挑三拣四的。”

“什么货物都可以？”

“是的。”

“我去想想办法吧。”弗兰基说，“在哪里找你？”

“我到明珠咖啡馆去。”我告诉他说，“得把肚子填饱。”

在明珠咖啡馆，花两毛五就可以饱餐一顿。菜单上的菜全都是一毛一份，除了汤收五分。我和弗兰基一道走到了咖啡馆，然后分手，我进去了，他则继续前行。临别，他握了握我的手，又在我的背上拍了拍。

“别发愁，”他说道，“我弗兰基足智多谋，懂行情，就是爱喝酒，口袋里没钱。不过，我够朋友讲义气。别发愁。”

“再见，弗兰基。”我说，“你也别发愁，伙计。”

说完，我进了明珠咖啡馆，拣一张桌子坐下。此前被子弹打碎的窗户玻璃已换上了新的，样酒柜也修好了。一群西班牙人在吧台喝酒，也有几个吃饭的。一张桌子玩起了多米诺骨牌。我点了份黑豆汤和一份土豆炖牛肉，花了一毛五，又要了瓶哈土依(10)啤酒，总共两毛五。我和服务员聊起枪战的事，对方缄口不语。他们全都把胆吓破了。

吃完饭，我把身子向后一靠，抽了一根烟，满肚子的忧愁。突然，只见弗兰基走进了门，后边跟着个人。我心想，是“黄货”。原来是要我运“黄货”！

“这位是辛先生。”弗兰基说，脸上堆着笑容。他办事实在太麻利了，为此他很是得意。

“你好！”辛先生说。

这位辛先生看上去恐怕是我所见过的最为圆滑的人了。他虽为中国人，但说话的派头倒像个英国佬，身穿白西装，配一件丝绸衬衣，脖系黑领带，头戴一顶价值一百二十五块钱的巴拿马帽。

“喝杯咖啡好吗？”他问我。

“乐意奉陪。”

“谢谢。”辛先生说，“跟前没有别的人吧？”

“全都是咖啡馆的客人，别无他人。”我告诉他说。

“这就好。”辛先生说，“你有一条船吧？”

“有一条三十八英尺长的船，”我说，“一百马力的，科马斯船厂(11)制造。”

“哦，”辛先生说，“我还以为是条小帆船呢。”

“我的船装两百六十五个货箱绰绰有余。”

“愿意租给我吗？”

“你出什么价？”

“你不必亲自去。我提供船长和船员。”

“这可不行。”我说，“船到哪儿我就跟到哪儿。”

“明白了。”辛先生说，“能不能让我们单独谈谈？”他转过头对弗兰基说。弗兰基一副兴趣盎然的样子，冲他一笑。

“他耳朵聋。”我说道，“他的英语也不怎么样。”

“明白了。”辛先生说，“你会说西班牙语，请你告诉他，让他过一会儿再来。”

我用拇指向弗兰基打了个手势。他起身到吧台那儿去了。

“你不会说西班牙语吗？”我问道。

“哦，会倒是会。”辛先生说，“你是遇到了什么情况，竟然愿意考虑……”

“我现在囊空如洗。”

“明白了。”辛先生说，“这条船有没有欠账？会不会遭到扣押？”

“不会的。”

“那就好。”辛先生说，“我的不幸的同胞搭你的船，一次能装多少人？”

“你是说装人？”

“是的。”

“有多远的路程？”

“一天的航程。”

“这可说不准。”我说，“如果不带行李，可以装十来个人吧。”

“他们不带行李。”

“把他们运到哪儿去？”

“那就看你了。”辛先生说。

“你是说由我决定把他们运往何处？”

“你先把他们装上，往托尔图加斯开，那儿有条纵帆船接他们。”

“听着，”我说道，“托尔图加斯的罗格海德岛有座灯塔，灯塔里有电台，两个方向都在其范围之内。”

“不错。”辛先生说，“只有傻子才会把人运到那儿去。”

“此话怎讲？”

“我是叫你把船往那儿开。送到那儿就完事。”

“好吧。”我说。

“到时候你见机行事，随便把他们卸到哪里都可以。”

“纵帆船会到托尔图加斯接他们吗？”

“当然不会去的。”辛先生说，“那也太傻了。”

“每个人多少钱？”

“五十块。”辛先生说。

“不行。”

“七十五块怎么样？”

“每个人你自己拿多少钱？”

“这是两件风马牛不相及的事情。就拿签发通行证来说吧，里面用钱的地方很多，或者说关系牵扯到的很多。我不是一个人吃独食。”

“是呀。”我说，“可我也不能为了几个小钱去冒这个险吧？”

“你的意思我完全明白。”辛先生说，“每个人一百块怎么样？”

“听着，”我说道，“你知道我要是被抓住，会蹲多少年的监狱吗？”

“十年，”辛先生说，“至少十年。不过，怎么可能会叫你蹲监狱呢，亲爱的船长？你只有一点风险——那就是让乘客登船的时候。接下来就看你如何随机应变、见风使舵了。”

“如果再把他们运回来交给你呢？”

“这很简单。我就对他们说是你耍了我。我会退还一部分钱，然后再找船送他们走。他们当然知道走这趟水路困难重重。”

“你会把我怎么样？”

“我可能会把情况通报给领事馆。”

“明白了。”

“能挣一千二百块钱呢，船长，在当下可不是个叫人小觑的数目。”

“什么时候能拿到钱？”

“同意后，先付给你两百块，把人装上船时，再付你一千。”

“要是我拿上两百块的预付金跑路了呢？”

“那我也没办法。”他笑了笑说，“不过，我知道你不会做这种事的，船长。”

“你把两百块的预付金拿来了吗？”

“那还用说。”

“把钱放到盘子底下。”

他按照要求做了。

“好吧。”我说，“明天上午我办理离港手续，天一黑就出发。让他们在哪个地方上船？”

“在巴库蓝澳怎么样？”

“一言为定。”我说，“你是不是都安排好了？”

“当然喽。”

“好，再说说怎么上船吧。”我说道，“你到岬角去亮起两盏灯，一上一下，我看见灯光就把船开过去。你用一条小船把他们送过来，叫他们从那儿上我的船。你要亲自来，而且要把钱带来。我是不见兔子不撒鹰，见了钱才让他们上我的船。”

“好的。”他说，“他们上船时付给你一半，等全部上了船，再付另一半给你。”

“很好，”我说，“这样合乎情理。”

“就这样决定啦？”

“我想是的。”我说，“不许带行李，不许带凶器——枪、匕首或剃刀什么的。这一点必须说清。”

“船长，”辛先生说道，“难道你不信任我吗？咱俩的利益是一致的。”

“你敢肯定是一致的吗？”

“请别说扫兴的话。”他说，“咱俩是一根绳子上拴的蚂蚱，难道你看不出来吗？”

“好吧。”我说道，“你什么时候到那儿？”

“午夜之前。”

“一言为定。”我说，“该说的都说了。”

“你想要什么样票面的钱？”

“就要百元钞吧。”

他起身离去，我目送他出了门。临别时，弗兰基冲他笑了笑。这个中国人看上去很圆滑，是个精明强干的人。

弗兰基回到了餐桌跟前。“怎么样？”他问道。

“你是在哪里认识辛先生的？”

“他是贩运华人的，”弗兰基说，“做的是大生意。”

“你认识他多久了？”

“他来这儿大概有两年之久。”弗兰基说，“在他之前有过一个人也是贩运华人的，后来被人杀死了。”

“总有一天辛先生也会被杀死的。”

“免不了呀，”弗兰基说，“早晚都会的。树大招风嘛。”

“是有些来头呀。”我说。

“他的生意大着呢。”弗兰基说，“他贩运的华人一去不返。只听那边华人写信说日子很好过。”

“那就好。”我说。

“这些华人目不识丁。凡是肚子里有墨水的华人都发了。这些华人别的什么都不吃，只吃大米。算起来，男性华人有几十万，而女性只有三个。”

“为什么？”

“政府不让女的来呗。”

“这样的日子可是难熬呀。”我说。

“你和他把生意谈成了？”

“差不多吧。”

“这是好生意，”弗兰基说，“比搞政治强，能挣大钱，财源滚滚。”

“来喝杯啤酒。”我对他说。

“现在不发愁了吧？”

“不发愁了。”我说，“这是笔赚大钱的生意。多谢你了。”

“满意就好。”弗兰基说着拍了拍我的脊背，“我比什么都高兴。只要你快活我就心满意足了。贩运华人的生意不错吧？”

“棒得很。”

“这话我听了高兴。”弗兰基说。

看得出由于事情办得极为顺利，他高兴得都快要哭了，于是我在他的背上轻轻拍了拍。弗兰基真是个好人！

次日上午，我做的第一件事就是揪住代理人，让他给我办出港的手续。他问我要船员的名单，我说没有船员。

“你单枪匹马独闯大海，我的船长？”

“一点不错。”

“你的那个同伴呢？”

“他喝醉了。”我对他说。

“一个人去是很危险的。”

“不过就是九十英里的路嘛。”我说，“你以为船上带着个醉汉就不危险了吗？”




我把船开到了港口对面的标准石油公司的码头，将两个油箱都加满了油，差不多有两百加仑。一加仑两毛八的价钱我嫌贵，可又不知还能到哪儿去加。

自从见过那个中国人，收了他的预付金，我的心里就七上八下的，担心会出事，夜里睡觉都睡不安稳。当我把船开回旧金山码头时，埃迪正在那儿等我。

“你好，哈利。”他喊了一声，挥了挥手。我把缆绳扔给了他，他拴牢后，纵身跳上了船，显得比以前个子更高了，目光更无神了，醉意也更浓了。我一句话也没对他说。

“约翰逊那家伙脚底板抹油一溜了之，你打算怎么办，哈利？”他问我，“他的下落你知道吗？”

“快给我滚开，”我对他说道，“看见你，我就感到恶心。”

“兄弟，我不是跟你一样也心里不是滋味吗？”

“快滚下船去！”我呵斥道。

他却没加理会地往椅子上一靠，将两条腿一伸。“听说今天要过海去了。”他说道，“哎，光滞留在这儿是生不出钱来的。”

“不要你去。”

“怎么啦，哈利？你没理由冲着我发火呀。”

“没理由？快给我滚下船去！”

“喔，别发火哟。”

我二话不说，给了他脸上一拳。他站起身，连滚带爬到了码头上。

“哈利，我要是你，就不会这么绝情绝义。”他说道。

“反正我不会带你去。”我告诉他说，“这就是我的决定。”

“哼，那你也没有必要打我呀。”

“打你，是为了让你相信我的话。”

“你让我咋办呢？坐在这儿等着饿死？”

“饿死个屁。”我说道，“你可以在渡口打工嘛，可以打工挣回国的路费。”

“你对我太不公道了。”他说。

“那么，你对谁公道了，酒鬼？”我反唇相讥道，“你连你的老娘都会出卖的。”

这话可没有冤枉他。不过，打了他还是叫我心里挺过意不去的。出手打一个酒鬼，给人一种恃强凌弱的感觉。可是，事已至此，我即便想带他去，也不能带了。

他悻悻地顺着码头走了。看他那瘦麻秆样，像是几天没吃饭饿的。走到半截，他又拐了回来。

“给我几块钱让我带在身上好吗，哈利？”

我从那个中国人付的预付金中抽了一张五块钱的钞票甩给了他。

“我早就知道你够哥们。哈利，这次为何不带上我一起去呢？”

“你是个扫把星。”

“这是在说气话。”他说道，“没关系，老伙计。你早晚都会乐意见我的。”

说完，他转身走了，口袋里有了钱，步点也轻快了许多。实话说，连他走路的姿势叫我看着也恶心。他走起路来，活似全身的关节都错了位。

他走后，我去了明珠咖啡馆，跟代理人碰了面，他把手续给了我，我请他喝了一杯。随即，我留下来吃午饭。饭间，弗兰基走进了门。

“一个家伙叫我把这个交给你。”他说着递给我一个卷状的玩意儿，外边包着张报纸，用一根红线绳扎好。打开报纸时，我觉得可能是幅照片，大概是哪个人在码头上给我的船拍的照片。

展开一看，果然是幅照片，是给一个死了的黑人的脑袋和胸膛拍的近照——黑人的喉咙被横着割断后又精心缝合，胸口上挂着个牌子，牌子上用西班牙文写着：“这就是长舌头(12)的下场。”

“是什么人给你的？”我问弗兰基。

他指了指一个常在码头上干活的西班牙小伙子，此刻那小厮正站在午饭柜台旁喝酒呢。

“让他过来。”

小伙子走了过来，说东西是在十一点左右两个年轻人交给他的。当时那两人问他认识不认识我，他说认识。后来，他就让弗兰基将东西转交给我。那两人给了他一块钱，吩咐说一定要把东西交到我的手里。他说那两人的穿着很讲究。

“这事来得蹊跷。”弗兰基说。

“是啊，来者不善，善者不来。”我说。

“他们可能是觉得你把那天上午的事情告诉了警方，说你跟那几个家伙接头来着。”

“是啊，是这样的。”

“这潭水深着呢。”弗兰基说，“三十六计走为上计。”

“他们留什么口信了吗？”我问那个西班牙小厮。

“没有。”他回答说，“光让我把这个交给你。”

“现在我是不得不走了。”我对弗兰基说。

“世情险恶呀，世情险恶呀！”弗兰基连连说道。

接下来，我将代理人给我的手续卷成一个卷，付了饭钱，大步流星出了咖啡馆，穿过广场，经过仓库，来到码头上，这才长长松了口气。那帮小子显然把我给盯上了。他们真是死脑筋，竟然怀疑我把他们出卖了。他们和潘乔是一丘之貉，一害怕就情绪激动，情绪一激动就想杀人。

我上了船，发动引擎让它预热。弗兰基站在码头上观看，脸上挂着他的那种傻傻的耳聋人的微笑。我下了船，回到了他身旁。

“听着，”我说道，“你可千万别引火烧身卷进这件麻烦事。”

他听不清我的话，我只好大声喊了几句。

“我会小心的。”弗兰基说。

他解掉缆绳，把船一推。我挥手告别，他把缆绳抛到了船上。我驾船驶出泊位，沿水道前行。一艘英国货轮正在驶出港口。我先是跟它并行，继而超越。出了海港，过了岬角，我驾船向北航行，驶上了前往基维斯特(13)的航道。这时，我离开船舵，到船头把缆绳缠绕好，然后又回来继续把舵。哈瓦那耸立在船尾，不久便被远远地甩在了身后，眼前只有巍巍群山。

过了一会儿，岬角淡出了视野，接着国家大酒店匿去了身影。最后只剩下了国会大厦的圆顶仍依稀可见。和钓鱼的最后一天相比较，今天的水流不算急，只有一丝微风。我看见几只帆船正驶向哈瓦那。它们是从西边来的，由此判断水流是平缓的。

我闭了开关，关了引擎，觉得没必要浪费汽油。就让船随波逐流漂吧。天黑了，总还是可以看见岬角的灯光的，即便船漂得太远了，仍有科希玛的灯光指引航向，那时我将驾船向巴库蓝澳开。按水流现在的流速，天黑前估计船能漂出十二英里，顺利抵达巴库蓝澳，刚好看得到巴拉克阿华灯初上。

关上引擎后，我摸到船头向四下里瞭望，只能看得到两只帆船向西驶向港口，还看得见老远处国会大厦的圆顶，白白的，耸立在大海的边缘。湾流里漂着一些马尾藻，寥寥几只海鸟在觅食。我坐到船舱的顶上观望了一会儿，只能看得见一些棕色的小鱼围着马尾藻游来游去的，不见大鱼的踪影。朋友，要是有人说哈瓦那和基维斯特之间的水域不算辽阔，你可不要相信那套鬼话。我的船行驶了老半天，还只是在这片水域的边缘呢。

过了一会儿，我又回到了驾驶舱里，不料埃迪却在那儿！

“出什么事啦？引擎怎么啦？”

“坏了。”

“你怎么没把舱门关上？”

“哼，少来这一套！”我说了一声。

你猜这家伙是怎么出现的？他是溜回来的，悄悄进了前舱，钻进卧室睡大觉去了。他带来了两瓶酒——他在路边见了个商店就把酒买下带到了船上来。开船时，他一度醒来，后来又睡着了。到了海湾里，我关掉引擎，船随波有些晃动，把他给晃醒了。

“我就知道你会带上我的，哈利。”他说。

“带上你个屁。”我说道，“船员名单上根本就没有你的名字。我真想看着你跳进大海里去。”

“你真会开玩笑，哈利。”他说，“大家都是‘海螺’嘛，遇到困难应该同舟共济。”

“坏就坏在你这张嘴上，头脑一发热就嘴上不把门，看谁还敢信任你。”我说道。

“我是个好人，哈利。你可以考验一下我，看我可信不可信。”

“把那两瓶酒拿过来。”我说道。我心里有事，没跟他多啰唆。

他把酒拿了来。我拎过一瓶打开了的酒喝了一口，然后将两瓶酒都放在了船舵旁。他仍站在那儿，我看了他一眼，为他心里感到难过，也为自己迫不得已如此对待他而感到难过。唉，刚认识他的时候，他可是好端端一个人。

“这船出什么毛病了，哈利？”

“它没有毛病。”

“那究竟出什么事啦？你为什么用那种眼光看我？”

“兄弟，”我心里为他感到难过，嘴里说道，“你的麻烦大着呢。”

“这话是什么意思，哈利？”

“现在还说不清。”我说道，“情况复杂，我还没有理出个头绪呢。”

我们在那儿坐了一会儿。我心里觉得不愿意再和他说下去了。此念一起，这场谈话便难以为继了。于是我下到船舱里，把藏在那里的气枪和一支30-30温彻斯特步枪取出来，挂在驾驶舱顶平时挂钓竿的架子上，正处于船舵的上方，随手可拿。我一直把步枪上足油，放在一个短羊毛枪套里。船上潮湿，唯有如此才可以防止步枪生锈。

我打开气枪的气泵，给枪打了几下气，把气充满，将一颗子弹装入枪膛，给温彻斯特步枪的枪膛也装了颗子弹，再将弹仓装满。然后，我从坐垫下抽出那支我在迈阿密当警察时佩带的史密斯-文森38式手枪，擦拭一番，上了油，顶上子弹，挂在我的腰带上。

“这是怎么回事？”埃迪问，“这到底是怎么回事？”

“没什么。”我说道。

“那你摆出这么多枪干什么？”

“在船上我总是带枪的。”我说，“遇见有鸟来吃鱼饵，或者有鲨鱼出没于基斯群岛，我就开枪打它们。”

“活见鬼，搞的是什么名堂？”埃迪说，“这到底是怎么回事？”

“没什么。”我告诉他说。我坐在那儿，船一晃动，腰带上挂的那支38式手枪就顶一下我的腿。看着他，我不由心想，跟他闹僵没有多大意思，说到底还是要用到他呢。

“咱们要去办点小事。”只听我启口说道，“地点是在巴库蓝澳。到时候我再告诉你是什么事吧。”

我不想事先让他知道得太多，因为那会叫他提心吊胆，吓得魂不守舍，就派不上用场了。

“当你的帮手，谁都比不上我，哈利。”他说道，“我是最佳人选。我会跟着你上刀山下火海。”

看了看他那副窝囊样——傻高个，睡眼惺忪，颤颤巍巍，我一句话都没说。

“听我说，哈利。能不能叫我喝上一口？”他央求道，“不喝酒，我就浑身发抖。”

我让他喝了些酒，然后我们俩就坐在那儿等天黑。夕阳很壮观，清风拂面让人感到惬意。太阳彻底沉入大海后，我发动引擎，驾船徐徐向陆地驶去。

夜色里，我们在离岸大约有一英里的地方停了下来。太阳一落下去，潮水就涨了。我注意到潮水在向岸边涌动。只见远处的岬角亮起了灯光，哈瓦那则是一片灯海，对面的利康和巴拉克阿也灯光闪烁。我驾船逆流而行，经过巴库蓝澳，一直驶到了科希玛跟前。然后，我就让船由着自己漂。四下里漆黑一片，但我知道船漂到了哪里。这时，我把船上的灯全熄灭了。

“这是干什么呀，哈利？”埃迪问道。他老毛病又犯，又害怕了起来。

“你看这是干什么？”

“不知道。”他说，“你让我感到害怕。”看他那样子，吓得都有点发抖了。他挨近我身边时，嘴里发出一股恶臭，就像秃鹰身上的那种气味。

“几点啦？”

“我下去看看吧。”他说。他下到船舱里，回来后说已经九点半了。

“饿不饿？”我问他。

“不饿。”他回答说，“你知道我不吃饭可以，不喝酒是不行的，哈利。”

“那好吧，”我说道，“那你就喝一口吧。”

等他喝了口酒，我问他感觉如何，他说感觉棒极了。

“过会儿再让你来上几口。”我告诉他说，“我知道你不喝酒便没有胆量。可船上的酒不多，你就省着点喝吧。”

“告诉我这是要去干什么。”埃迪说。

“听着，”我在黑咕隆咚的夜幕中对他说道，“咱们到巴库蓝澳接十二个华人。到时候听我的吩咐，由你掌舵，叫你干什么你就干什么。先让那十二个华人上船，再将他们反锁到前边的船舱里。现在你过去，先把舱门从外边插上。”

他听后就去了，夜空下可以看见他黑黑的身影。他返回时，便对我说：“哈利，现在可以喝上一口了吧？”

“不行。”我说道，“到时候还要你靠酒壮胆呢。我需要的不是酒囊饭袋。”

“我是很能干的，哈利。你瞧着吧。”

“你是个酒鬼。”我说，“你给我听好了。到时候一个华人会把那十二个人带过来的。一开始，他会给我一部分钱，等所有的人都上了船，他还会给我一部分钱。见他第二次给钱，你就把船开走，掉转船头往公海开。你不要管周围发生什么事情。哪怕天塌下来，你也不要停，照直朝前开。明白了吗？”

“明白了。”

“那些华人如果有谁往外冲，或者说破门而出，你就拿起气枪打他们，让他们退回去。气枪你知道怎么用吧？”

“不知道。不过，你可以教我嘛。”

“教你你也记不住。温彻斯特步枪知道怎么用吧？”

“只要扣动扳机，开枪就是了。”

“对。”我说，“只是有一点：不要在船上留下弹孔。”

“这下子该让我喝一口了。”埃迪说。

“好吧，就让你喝一小口吧。”实际上，我让他美美地喝了一口。我情知这工夫他不会醉的，他心里害怕得不得了，会把醉意驱赶跑的。可是，喝上一口，也只能暂时管点用。喝下这口酒后，他好像心情开朗了，只听他说：“这么说，咱们这是去运送华人。上天有眼。我不是早就说过，口袋里没有钱就去运送华人赚钱么。”

“以前难道你口袋里有钱吗？”我夹枪带棒地对他说。他说话倒是挺滑稽的。

我又让他喝了三口酒壮胆，让这份胆量一直持续到十点半钟。望着他，我觉得怪有趣的，免得我胡思乱想。想不到要等这么长时间。我原打算天黑后就走人，躲开人们的目光，沿海岸一直驶向科希玛。

快到十一点的时候，岬角上亮起了两盏灯。我稍等了一小会儿，然后就把船慢慢靠了上去。巴库蓝澳是个小海湾，以前有过一个装沙子的大码头。一条小河在此处汇入大海，雨季河水上涨，会将河口的沙坝冲开。冬天刮起北风，风力又会把沙子堆起，将缺口封死。以前有纵帆船在河上来往，贩运来番石榴，此处形成了一座小镇。可是飓风袭来，将整个小镇都卷走了，现在只剩下一座房屋了，那还是一些西班牙人在飓风肆虐之后在废墟上盖起来的。星期天，他们从哈瓦那过来游泳和野餐，把这座房屋用作俱乐部。还有一座房屋是管理员住的，不过那儿离海滩挺远的。

在沿海地区，像这种小地方哪儿都有政府的管理员。不过，我觉得那个中国人肯定弄到了自己的船，而且把此处的管理员买通了。船驶近海湾时，我闻到一股海葡萄的芳香，那是陆地上海葡萄灌木散发的香气。

“你起来，到前边去。”我对埃迪说。

“靠这边不会撞上什么东西的，”他说，“而那边有礁石，小心撞上。”

嗬，这小子这次说话还挺在理呢。

“你小心看着点。”我说道。随后，我把船开进了海湾，在此处估计他们能看得见我们。这儿没有海浪拍岸的声音，引擎的声音清晰可闻。我不知道他们到底看见了我们没有，不愿瞎等，于是便将船灯亮了亮（只亮的是红灯和绿灯），然后就关上了。接着，我掉转船头，将船开出海湾，引擎不熄火，让船漂在海上。一阵阵小小的海潮不断涌来。

“你回到这边来吧。”我对埃迪说，而后让他痛快地喝了几口。

“开枪时，是不是先用拇指扣扳机？”他低声问我。此时他坐在船舵跟前，而我已经将两个枪套都打开，枪柄露出来大约有六英寸长。

“是这样的。”

“哈，原来如此。”

几口酒下肚立竿见影，让这家伙茅塞顿开。

我们候在那里，可以看见管理员的房子里射出一线灯光，穿透了灌木丛。只见岬角上的那两盏灯下去了，其中的一盏绕过岬角，另一盏可能是被他们熄灭了。

过了一小会儿，我看见有只船出了海湾，由一个人划着桨靠了过来。根据桨手一前一后晃动的身影判断，他划的是只大桨。我觉得心里挺高兴的，因为既然是划桨而来，那就说明只来了一个帮手。

等那条船划到跟前，辛先生说：“晚上好，船长。”

“把船划到后边，和我的船靠拢。”我说道。

他冲着桨手说了几句什么，可是桨手无法把船朝后划，于是我便抓住船舷上缘，把那条船拉到了我的船的尾部。他们的船上共八人——六位华人乘客，外加辛先生和那个桨手。我伸手把他们的船朝后拉时，真担心头上会挨一家伙，幸好平安无事。于是我直起腰，让辛先生抓紧船的尾部。

“让我先验验货。”我说道。

他把钱递给了我，我拿到正守在船舵旁的埃迪跟前，打开罗经柜灯，仔仔细细查看了一番，觉得没问题，便关上了灯。此时，埃迪吓得浑身抖如筛糠。

“你去给自己倒上一杯喝吧。”我说道。

我看见他取过一瓶酒，仰脖子就喝。

我又回到了船尾。

“好啦，”我说道，“让这六个人上船吧。”

虽然风浪并不大，辛先生和那个划船的古巴人费了很大劲才将小船稳住，免得两船相碰撞。我听见辛先生用中文说了句什么，那些中国乘客便争先恐后开始往我的船上爬。

“一个一个地来。”我说。

辛先生又说了句什么，那六个人便依次上了我的船，一个个高矮不等，胖瘦不均。

“带他们到前边去。”我对埃迪说。

“请到这边来，先生们。”埃迪说。好家伙，我知道他刚才喝的真不少。

“把舱门锁上。”待那些人进了船舱，我吩咐道。

“好的，先生。”埃迪说。

“我去把另外的几个也送过来。”辛先生说。

“好的。”我说。

然后，我把他们的船推开，那个桨手便吱呀吱呀把船划走了。

“听着，”我对埃迪说，“你不用再喝酒了，因为你现在的胆量已经够大了。”

“遵命，头儿。”埃迪说。

“你这是怎么啦？”

“这样的活儿我喜欢干。”埃迪说，“正如你所言，大拇指一勾就完事。”

“你这个臭酒鬼。”我说道，“把酒拿过来，让我喝一口。”

“全喝完了。”埃迪说，“对不起，头儿。”

“听着，你一定要擦亮眼睛盯着点。他把钱一交给我，你就将船开走。”

“遵命，头儿。”埃迪说。

我伸手把另一瓶酒取了出来，又拿来开塞钻将瓶塞打开，痛痛快快喝了几口，然后回到了船尾，把瓶塞又塞紧，将酒瓶放在了盛满了水的柳条壶后面。

“辛先生过来了。”我对埃迪说。

“看到了，先生。”埃迪说。

只见他们的船划了过来。

辛先生吩咐把船靠近我们的船尾。我让他们用手抓牢。于是，辛先生抓住了横在船尾上的滚筒（平时抓到大鱼，都是利用这滚筒将其拖上船的）。

“让他们上船吧，”我说，“一个一个地上。”

又是六个形形色色的中国人，依次爬上了船尾。

“打开舱门，领他们过去。”我对埃迪说。

“遵命，先生。”埃迪说。

“把舱门锁上。”

“遵命，先生。”

接下来，我看见他守在了船舵旁。

“好啦，辛先生，”我说道，“把其余的钱让我看看。”

他伸手从口袋里取出钱递给我。我没接钱，却一把揪住他的手腕，将他拽上船尾，用另一只手卡住他的脖子。我感觉得到船启动了，嘟嘟嘟地朝前开。虽说我对付辛先生已忙得不得了，但我还是向那个桨手瞧了一眼，看见那个古巴人站在小船的尾部，手里拿着船桨，眼睁睁看着辛先生扑腾来扑腾去的。辛先生拼命挣扎，那股折腾的劲要比上了钩的海豚还要厉害。

我反扭住他的一条胳膊，用劲地扳，可由于用力过猛，把那条胳膊给扳断了。只听他小声怪叫了一声，向前一冲，尽管我依然卡着他的脖子，他还是一口咬在了我的肩膀上。一感到他被反扭的那条胳膊断了，我便松了手。那条胳膊对他已没有用了。随即，我便用两只手卡他的脖子。朋友，辛先生扑腾起来真跟鱼差不多，那条废了的胳膊晃来晃去的。我用劲一拖，让他跪倒在地，将两个拇指抠进他的喉管，咔嚓一声把气管什么的全都抠断了。那声音清晰可闻。

他没有了动静。片刻之后，我松了手，将他放倒在船尾上。他仰面朝天静静躺在那儿，穿着考究的衣服，两只脚伸进驾驶舱里。最后，我丢下他走了。

我把散落在驾驶舱地板上的钱一一捡起，放到罗经柜上清点。点完钱，我接过船舵，吩咐埃迪到船尾那儿去找几个铁块。平时，一旦在礁石区或者岩底海域钓鱼，抛锚怕坏了锚钩，我就拿铁块当锚使用。

“我是找不到的。”埃迪说。他显然是害怕去，因为那儿躺着个辛先生。

“你来掌舵。”我说道，“把船往公海上开。”

此时，船舱里窸窸窣窣有了一阵动静。不过，我并没有为此而担心。

我找到了两个自己所需的铁块（这铁块是从托尔图加斯的煤炭码头上弄来的），取过一些粗鱼线，将这沉沉的两个大铁块绑在辛先生的脚踝上。当船开到距离岸边大约有两英里的地方，我把他推了下去——他从滚筒上一出溜就进了海水里。我甚至都没有检查他的口袋看里面有什么东西。我不愿再跟这家伙打交道了。

他刚才鼻子和嘴出血，滴在了甲板上。我用水桶从海里取了些水，从船尾的底下拿来个板刷，将甲板擦洗干净。取水的时候，船速过快，差点没把我甩下船。

“开慢点。”我对埃迪说。

“他要是浮上来怎么办？”埃迪说。

“我把他沉下去了，大约有七百英寻深呢。”我说，“他一直沉到底了。深着呢，兄弟。要是不产生气体，他是浮不上来的。他会跟着水流走，全当是鱼饵啦。让他见鬼去吧。”我说，“你不用再操辛先生的心了。”

“你和他有什么过意不去的？”埃迪问。

“没什么过意不去的。”我说，“他是我见过的最容易谈生意的人。不过我总觉得里边有什么鬼把戏。”

“你为什么要杀他呀？”

“是为了阻止他断送另外十二个中国人的命。”我回答说。

“哈利，”埃迪说，“我感到胃里翻腾得厉害，你得让我喝上一口。看见他耷拉着脑袋的样子，我觉得挺恶心的。”

于是我就让他喝了一口酒。

“这些中国乘客你打算怎么办？”埃迪问。

“尽可能赶快放他们走。”我回答说，“别让他们弄脏了船舱。”

“你准备把他们送到哪里？”

“在岸边找个地方让他们上岸就是了。”我回答说。

“现在就靠岸？”

“一点不错，”我说，“慢慢向岸边开。”

我们把船慢慢开过礁石区，开到一处能看见闪闪发亮海滩的位置。礁石区的水很深，海底是沙地，形成一个坡度通向海岸。

“你到前边去，把水的深度告诉我。”

他拿上测量杆开始测水深，一边测一边向我通报。最后，他回到我身边，让我把船停下。我把船倒着退了一下，然后停了下来。

“此处水深大约是五英尺。”

“就在这里抛锚吧。”我说，“万一有意外情况出现，来不及起锚，就把缆绳砍断或者挣脱缆绳。”

埃迪一点点把缆绳放出去，直至船锚触底，再将缆绳拴牢。船的尾部朝着岸边。

“这地方是沙地。”他说道。

“船尾那儿的水深是多少？”

“不超过五英尺。”

“你把步枪拿到手里。”我吩咐道，“小心点。”

“让我喝上一口吧。”他说。他显得紧张极了。

我让他喝了口酒，然后将气枪从架子上取了下来，走过去开了舱门的锁，把门拉开，高喊一声：“都给我出来！”

舱里没有任何动静。

后来，一个中国人探出头看了看，见埃迪荷枪实弹站在那儿，就又缩了回去。

“都出来。你们不会受到伤害的。”我说道。

仍不见人出来。只听见里面有人在用中文叽里呱啦说话。

“快出来！”埃迪吼了一声。我的老天，一听就知道他偷喝酒了。

“不许再喝了。”我对他说，“不然我就崩了你，送你下海喂鱼鳖。”

“都给我出来！”我又冲那些中国人喊道，“不出来我就开枪了。”

只见他们当中的一个朝门角那儿望了望，显然是看到了沙滩，因为他叽里呱啦对同伴们讲了一通中文。

“快点，”我说道，“不然我就开枪了。”

他们乖乖地出来了。

实话讲，要杀害这么一群手无寸铁的中国人，恐怕黑心肠的人也难以下手，更何况这绝对不是件容易办到的事，就别提还会把船弄脏了。

他们一个个走出了船舱，吓得似惊弓之鸟。他们虽然没有枪，但毕竟有十二个人呢。我端着气枪，步步倒退，一直退到船尾。“都给我下船去。”我命令道，“水不深，淹不过头顶。”

没有人听令而行。

“快给我下去。”

还是没人遵命。

“你们这些吃老鼠肉的黄种人，”埃迪呵斥道，“都下船去。”

“闭上你的嘴，酒鬼。”我对埃迪说道。

“不会游泳。”一个中国人说道。

“不需要游泳，”我告诉他，“水不深。”

“快点，快下船去。”埃迪说。

“你到船尾这边来，”我说，“一只手拿枪，一只手拿测量杆，让他们亲眼看看水的深度。”

埃迪照我的话做了。

“不需要游泳？”刚才的那个中国人问道。

“是的。”

“真的吗？”

“真的。”

“这是哪儿。”

“古巴。”

“你这个可恶的骗子。”他说完便下了船，先是拉着船帮不放，后来松了手，结果一下子没于水中。不过，他马上又露出了头，下巴能露出水面。

“可恶的骗子。”他连声说，“可恶的骗子。”

他失去了理智，但是胆量却不小。他又说了几句中文，其他的中国人也从船尾纷纷跳下了水。

“好啦，”我对埃迪说，“起锚吧。”

我们驾船离开岸边时，月亮露出了脸，可以看见那些中国人头露出水面在向岸上走，还看得见闪着亮光的沙滩和沙滩后的灌木丛。

船驶过礁石区，到了公海上。我回头一望，沙滩和群山清晰地映入了眼帘。随后，我们驶上了前往基维斯特的航程。

“现在，你可以睡大觉了。”我对埃迪说，“且慢！你先去船舱把舷窗都打开，跑跑里面的臭气，再把碘酒给我拿来。”

“怎么啦？”他把碘酒拿来时问道。

“手指给割破了。”

“想让我掌舵吗？”

“你去睡吧。”我说，“到时候我叫醒你。”

他就在驾驶舱里的小床上躺了下来——那小床和墙壁连为一体，位于油箱的上方。过了一小会儿，他就呼呼大睡了起来。

我用膝盖顶住船舵，解开衬衣查看辛先生咬我的伤情。那一口咬得真厉害，我在伤口上涂了些碘酒。接下来，我坐在那儿掌舵，心里胡思乱想起来，怀疑那个中国人咬那一口是有毒的。后来，听着悦耳、平稳的引擎声以及哗哗的海水声，我心里渐渐静了下来，觉得那一口不会有毒的。辛先生那样的人可能一天要刷两三次牙呢。论做生意，他肯定是个门外汉。不过，他也许精通做生意呢，只是轻信了我，才落了个这样的下场。实话说，对于他，我实在猜不透。

现在，除了埃迪，其他的事情都很简单了。那家伙是个酒鬼，一喝得上了头，嘴上就不把门。我一边开船一边望了他一眼。心想他还不如死了的好，那样我就可以高枕无忧了。起初在船上看到他，我就起了杀机，想把他干掉，后来见事情办得顺风顺水，也就狠不下心去了。此刻见他躺在那里，杀他的念头又被兜了起来。不过，转念一想，觉得杀他会把事情搞糟，过后会后悔的。可是，船员名单上没有他的名字，带上他就得交罚款，真叫人伤脑筋，不知怎样处置他才好。

对于此事，我斟酌了许久，一边驾船在航道上行驶，时不时把他拎上船的那瓶酒拿起来喝上一口。那瓶酒所剩不多，喝完后我就把我自己仅有的一瓶打开了。告诉你吧，驾着船在海上兜风的感觉是很好的，这样的夜晚夜色迷人呀。这桩生意起初屡屡出现不祥之兆，但结局却符合人意。

天亮时，埃迪睡醒了。他说他感到浑身不舒服。

“你来掌一会儿舵，”我吩咐他说，“我到那边查看一下。”

我回到船尾，在上面泼了些水冲洗。其实那儿很干净，没有留下污痕。接下来，我用刷子把船帮刷了刷，将两支枪的子弹都退出来，再把它们藏在船舱里。不过，手枪我还是继续挂在腰带上。船舱里空气清新，完全符合我的心意，没有一点点异味。只是从右舷窗进了些海水，溅在了一张小床上。我走过去把舷窗关上了。天下没有一个海关官员能嗅得出这儿曾经关过中国人。

查看间，我望了一眼船只驾驶执照的镜框，见装着清关手续的网兜仍挂在下方——那是我上船时随手挂在那儿的。我取出手续，又浏览了一遍，然后就回驾驶舱里去了。

“我问你，”我对埃迪说，“你是怎么把你的名字填在船员名单上的？”

“我碰见了代理人，他正要到领事馆去，我就说我也跟你一块出海。”

“上帝可真会照应酒鬼！”我说完，就从腰带上解下那支38式手枪，拿到船舱里去藏好。

我在船舱里煮了些咖啡，然后上来接过船舵说：“下边有咖啡，你去喝点吧。”

“哥们，咖啡对我一点不管用。”

看他的那副样子，你会不由得动恻隐之心——他看上去惨极了。

九点钟左右，我们在正前方看见了桑德基岛的灯塔。在这之前，早已见有油轮行驶在海湾水域上了。

“快要靠岸了。”我对他说，“还是按约翰逊的那个价，我每天付给你四块钱。”

“昨夜的生意你赚了多少钱？”他问我。

“仅仅六百块。”我告诉他说。

我也不知道他信不信我的话。

“难道没有我的一份吗？”

“刚才说的就是你的一份。”我告诉他说，“昨夜的事你要是泄露出去，让我知道了，我会要你的命的。”

“你清楚，我不是个口风不严的人，哈利。”

“你是个酒鬼。我可不管你喝多少酒，醉成什么程度，反正只要你说出去，就没有你的好果子吃。”

“我可是个守诚信的人。”他说，“你不该这般对我说话。”

“事物变化多端，谁知道你的诚信能不能守得住。”我对他说。不过，我不再为他担心了，因为他的话没人会相信的。辛先生不会再出声了，那些中国乘客也不会说的。还有那个划船的人，肯定也不会乱讲的。哪怕埃迪保不定什么时候说出去，可有谁会相信一个酒鬼的话呢？

嗬，谁都拿不出一点证据的！有人看见船员名单上有埃迪的名字，如果不见埃迪，自然会有不少话头。幸好我没有将他干掉。我可以说是他自己掉进海里了，可那会引得人说闲话的。埃迪可真是个幸运儿，可谓福星高照。

我们把船开到了湾流的边上，这儿的海水由蓝变成了淡色，微微发绿。放眼望去，可以看见长礁和西干岩上的标桩以及基韦斯特的无线电天线杆，可以看见高耸入云的拉孔查饭店鹤立鸡群于一片低矮房屋之间，还可以看见垃圾焚烧场那儿浓烟滚滚。桑德基岛的灯塔已近在眼前。灯塔旁边的船库和那个小码头也看得见了。我知道只剩下四十分钟的路程了。回家的感觉真好。如今钱囊充盈，足够夏日享用的了。

“干上一杯怎么样，埃迪？”我说道。

“哈，哈利，”他说，“我就知道你是个贴心的好伙计。”

告发


在那些日子，马德里的奇科特酒吧有点像鹳鸟夜总会那种去处，只是没有乐队伴奏和年轻女子相陪，又有点像华尔道夫酒店的男士酒吧。男士酒吧是不接待女士的，而奇科特酒吧有女士出入，可这儿毕竟是男人的世界，女士是没有地位的。酒吧老板叫佩德罗·奇科特。有个性的酒吧，老板必有个性，而佩德罗·奇科特就是这样的一个老板。他精通吧台的业务，待人和蔼可亲，总是满面春风的，谈吐优雅风趣。优雅风趣如今极为罕见，这类人如凤毛麟角。这种风度可不能跟逢场作戏混为一谈。奇科特是真的优雅风趣，而非做作，也非假装。而且，他谦虚朴素，以友谊示人。他真真切切是个大好人，一个叫人心情舒畅的人，论高超的处事能力，可比巴黎里兹酒吧的侍者乔治（业内能与奇科特媲美者唯有乔治了），所以他生意兴隆。

那年头的富家子弟，附庸风雅者混迹于一个叫新潮俱乐部的地方，而有主见的人则出入于奇科特酒吧。此处固然有许多人我都不喜欢，情况就跟鹳鸟夜总会一样，可每一次我都尽欢而归。其中有一个原因：此处不谈政治。有些酒吧成了光谈政治的场所，其他的话题一概不涉及，然而在奇科特酒吧人们闭口不谈政治。对于别的五花八门的话题，客人们则津津乐道。到了晚上，城里那些楚楚动人的年轻女子便纷纷而至，此处的夜生活很丰富，客人们各个都玩得很开心。

此处是交际场所，可以了解某某某在城内，如果出了城，那么究竟去了何方。假如是在夏天，人去城空，你尽可以来这儿消停地喝上一杯，因为此处的侍者待人和颜悦色。

此处又是个俱乐部，只是你不用付会员费，说不定你在这儿还会有艳遇呢。这儿肯定算得上是西班牙最好的酒吧了，我想恐怕也是全世界最好的酒吧，我们都喜欢来这儿消磨时光，对它有着深厚的感情。

再者，此处的酒称得上是香醪美酿。你不妨点一杯马丁尼——那可是用最好的酒料酿造出来的，别处拿钱也难买得到。奇科特酒吧供应的威士忌是来自于苏格兰的原桶装的好酒，比那些广而告之的品牌强多了，更会将普通的苏格兰威士忌比得无地自容。国内的叛乱爆发时，奇科特老板身在圣塞瓦斯蒂安，在那儿经营自家的夏日连锁店。这家店至今仍在他手里，据说是佛朗哥(1)占领区的头牌酒吧。马德里的这个分店由侍者代为管理，至今状况依旧，可是那些香醪美酿却绝了踪迹。

奇科特酒吧的老顾客多半拥护佛朗哥，有些则站在政府一边。由于该酒吧是个极为欢快的场所，顾客是真正的极为欢快的群体，欢快的人通常勇敢无畏，而勇者易于战死疆场，于是众多奇科特酒吧的老顾客已成作古之人。原桶装的威士忌数月前已售罄，杜松子金酒也于1938年5月被我们喝得点滴不剩。此处已风光不再，魅力大减，我觉得路易斯·戴尔卡多再晚一些时候来马德里，也许就不会来喝酒，也就不会惹祸上身了。可他是在1937年9月的那个月份来马德里的，那时该酒吧竟然还有杜松子金酒，竟然还有印度奎宁水。喝杯好酒，似乎也不值得豁上自己的身家性命。也许，他仅仅是想旧地重游，饮酒怀旧罢了。了解他这个人，了解昔日的奇科特酒吧，他的行为也就完全可以理解了。

那天，大使馆宰了头牛，门房打电话到佛罗里达旅馆告诉我们，说给我们留了十磅鲜肉。我穿过马德里冬日的薄暮，一路走过去取肉。大使馆门外有两个荷枪实弹的突击队员坐在椅子上，肉就放在门房小屋里等候领取。

守门人说牛是瘦了些，但切下来的这块肉相当不错。我从短大衣外套的口袋里掏出一些炒葵花子和橡子请他吃，两人就站在门房外的砾石车道上说笑了一会儿。

我把沉甸甸的牛肉夹在腋下，溜达着往回走。遇到格兰维亚大街(2)遭到轰炸，于是我便拐进奇科特酒吧躲避。这儿挤满了人，闹哄哄的。我走到一个角落里，紧靠用沙袋堵起来的窗户在一张小桌子旁坐了下来，将牛肉放在身边的板凳上，要了杯金汤力(3)喝。也就是在这个星期，我们发现这儿竟然还有奎宁水呢。自从战争爆发以来，没见有人喝过呀。此时的奎宁水仍卖的是老价钱，一如叛乱发生之前。喝酒间，晚报还没有印出，我便从一个老太太手里买了三份政党的党报，每份十分钱。我给了她一个比塞塔，叫她不用找零了。她说上帝一定会保佑我的，对此我倒是心存怀疑。之后，我便一边看那三份党报，一边喝金汤力。

一个我在过去早就认识的侍者走了过来，对我说了几句话。

“不会吧，”我说，“我不相信。”

“确有其事。”他语气坚定地说，一边将托盘斜了斜，脑袋歪了歪，指的都是同一个方向，“你别用眼睛看。他就在那里。”

“这不关我的事。”我告诉他说。

“跟我也没有关系。”

他说完就走开了。此时又有一个老太太进入店里卖刚出版的晚报，我买了份看了起来。毫无疑问，侍者没认错人。那家伙是我们俩再熟悉不过的了。我心里连连在说，真是傻呀，傻得简直不透气。

就在这时，一个希腊的战友走过来，在桌旁坐下。他是第十五旅的一个连长，一次空袭中被炸弹掀起的土埋了起来，另有四个军人当场毙命，而他却大难未死。后来，他被送进医院观察了一阵子，接下来转入一家疗养院什么的。

“你好吗，约翰？”我问他，“来喝上一杯尝尝味道。”

“这叫什么酒呀，埃德蒙兹先生？”

“金汤力。”

“金汤力是什么酒呀？”

“是加了奎宁水的。你喝一杯尝尝。”

“现在我不太喝酒了，不过，奎宁水对防治热病大有好处。我喝口尝尝吧。”

“对于你的病情，医生是怎么说的，约翰？”

“没必要去看医生。我没事的，只是头里有点嗡嗡叫罢了。”

“你应该去看医生的，约翰。”

“去倒是去了。可他不了解病情，说我没有证明不给看。”

“我打个电话通融一下。”我说，“医院里的人我认识。医生是不是个德国人？”

“没错，”约翰说，“是个德国人。他的英语说得不太好。”

闲聊间，那个侍者又走了过来。他是个谢了顶的老头，举止老派，战争也没有改变他待人接物的方式。此时的他脸上愁云密布。

“我有个儿子上了前线，”他说，“还有一个已经战死。现在又摊上了。”

“那是你自己的事。”

“那你呢？我可是已经告诉你了呀。”

“我来这儿是喝酒的，是在吃饭前来这儿喝上一杯。”

“我是来工作的。再怎么说，也得听听你的指教。”

“你的事你自己掂量。”我说，“我是不过问政治的。”

“你懂西班牙语吗，约翰？”我问那位希腊战友。

“不懂，几乎听不懂。我只会说希腊语、英语和阿拉伯语。有段时间，我的阿拉伯语还说得很好呢。我问你，你知道我是怎么被埋在了土里吗？”

“不知道。只知道你被土掩埋了。仅此而已。”

他脸膛黑黑的，一表人才，一双手黑透了，说起话把手挥来舞去的。他来自于一座海岛，一开口便情绪激昂。

“那好。我讲给你听听。你也知道，我曾身经百战。之前在希腊军队服役，我就是个上尉了。我可是个勇敢的战士。所以，那天在富恩特斯-埃布罗的战壕里见敌机俯冲过来，我躲也没躲，近距离观看它。眼看着它飞到我们的头顶，哗地来了个急转弯——就像这样……（他说着用手比画了一下飞机掉头的样子）它从空中观察我们。我对其他人说：‘啊哈，是奔着总参谋部来的，是来侦察的。马上还会有别的飞机来。’

“果不其然，又有一些敌机飞来了。我就站在那儿观察，一边仰头看一边把情况指给连里的弟兄们看。有两组敌机，每组三架。队形是一架在前，两架在后。一组三架飞过去之后，我对弟兄们说：‘看见了吧？一个编队飞过去了。’

“另外三架飞过时，我说道：‘现在好啦，没有事啦。不用再害怕了。’以后的情况我就不知道了，一连昏迷了两个星期。”

“这事发生在什么时候？”

“约莫一个月之前。炮弹掀起的土把我埋住的时候，头盔恰好遮在了我的脸上，于是我就呼吸头盔里的那点空气，直至被人挖出，当时具体的情况我便不得而知了。头盔里有空气，但里面含着爆炸后产生的硝烟，呛得我生了很长时间的病。现在身体康复了，只是脑袋里有嗡嗡叫的声音。这酒叫什么酒呀？”

“叫金汤力，是加了舒味思印度奎宁水的。战前这家酒吧是高消费场所，当时一美元换七个比塞塔，而一瓶金汤力就卖五个比塞塔。这家店仍有奎宁水，我们也是才发现的。价钱还是原先的价钱。只剩下一桶了。”

“味道还是挺不错的。给我讲讲这座城市战前的情况怎么样？”

“好的。其实和现在差不多，只是吃的东西很丰富。”

那个侍者又走了过来，朝我跟前探过身子。

“我要是袖手旁观恐怕不行吧？”他说，“我有这个责任呀。”

“既然你愿意插手，那就去打个电话，拨这个号码吧。你把它记下来。”

他用笔记了下来。

“你找皮珀听电话。”我说。

“我和他前世无冤今世无仇。”侍者说，“但此事关系重大，这样的一个人势必会危害我们的事业。”

“别的侍者没有认出他吧？”

“我想是的。没听谁说什么。他是过去的老顾客。”

“我也是老顾客呀。”

“也许他现在也站在咱们这一边了。”

“情况并非如此，”我说道，“这我很清楚。”

“我可从来没告发过任何人。”

“告发不告发由你决定。你不告发，也许别的侍者也会告发的。”

“不会的。这里只有老侍者认识他，而老侍者是不会告发的。”

“再来一瓶杜松子金酒，加点苦艾水。”我说道，“瓶子里还有些奎宁水呢。”

“他说什么来着？”约翰问，“我仅仅听懂了一点点。”

“店里来了一个人，是我们俩过去认识的老熟人。他经常打鸽子，是个神枪手。我亲眼见识过他百步穿杨的枪法。他是个法西斯分子，竟然敢在这儿抛头露面，不管出于什么原因，反正都是极为愚蠢之举。他是个天不怕地不怕的人，就是愚蠢至极。”

“你指给我看看。”

“就是和飞行员坐在同一张桌旁的那个。”

“哪个呀？”

“就是那个紫脸膛的，帽檐遮住了一只眼，此刻正在笑的那个。”

“他是个法西斯分子？”

“是的。”

“自从离开了富恩特斯-埃布罗，如此近距离看一个法西斯分子，我这还是第一次。这儿的法西斯分子很多吗？”

“时多时少。”

“他喝的酒跟你喝的一样。”约翰说，“喝这种酒，别人会不会也把咱们当成法西斯分子呢？我问你，你去过南美洲西海岸的麦哲伦(4)吗？

“没去过。”

“那地方挺好，就是涨鱼有点太多了。”

“什么太多了？”

“就是涨鱼呗。”他重音念错了，把“章”念成了“涨”。“你知道就是那种有八条腿的鱼。”

“噢，”我说，“那是章鱼。”

“是的，是涨鱼。”约翰说，“你也知道，我还是个潜水员呢。那可是个潜水的好地方，挣的钱也不少，就是涨鱼太多了。”

“它们碍你的事了吗？”

“谁说得清呢。第一次在麦哲伦港口下海我就看见了涨鱼。它就像这样直直站立在那儿。”约翰说着将手指撑在桌子上，把手掌向上提，同时耸耸肩膀，眉头上扬，“它站起来比我还高呢，眼对眼地看着我。我一拉绳子，让他们赶快把我拽了上去。”

“多大的章鱼，约翰？”

“我说不准确，因为头盔上的潜水镜视物有点扭曲。不过，它的头围怎么说也超过了六英尺。它站在那里，像是踮着脚尖似的，样子跟这差不多。（他摆出架势，直盯住我的脸。）所以我赶紧出了水。他们取下我的头盔，我就说再也不下去了。管事的工头对我说：‘你这是怎么啦，约翰？你害怕章鱼，但章鱼更害怕你哩。’我回答说：‘无稽之谈！’这种法西斯酒，咱们再喝点怎么样？”

“好的。”我说。

我一直在观察着那边桌旁的那个人。他叫路易斯·戴尔卡多。上次见他是在1933年，在圣塞瓦斯蒂安的一次打鸽子比赛场上。记得决赛时，我和他一道站在看台上观望。我们都下了注——我下的注已超出了我的能力；而他下的注，如果输了，我相信他一年也缓不过劲来。他付清了下注的钱，我记得他满脸春色，好像输钱对他是莫大的荣幸似的。记得后来我们还在吧台一起喝了一杯马丁尼酒呢。我当时押赌输了钱，反而有一种财去人安乐的感觉，却不知他心里是怎么承受的呢。那个星期，我的枪法很臭，而他打得极为精彩，几乎打不到的鸟儿都会被他击落。我们之间赌钱，每次都是由他提出来。

“咱们比赛抛银圆吧？”他提议说。

“你真的想赌？”

“是的，如果你愿意的话。”

“赌多少？”

他掏出钱夹，朝里边看了看，哈哈一笑。

“你说赌多少，咱就赌多少。”他说，“不过，还是赌八千比塞塔吧。钱夹里好像就这么多了。”

这笔钱当时近乎一千美元。

“好吧。”我说。一说赌博，原来的那种静谧安然的心情顿时消失，那种空落落的感觉又回来了。“谁做庄？”

“我先来吧。”

我们各把一枚沉甸甸的五比塞塔的银圆放在手里，再将手圈成杯状摇摇。然后，各自把银圆放在左手的手背上，再用右手捂住。

“你的是哪一面？”他问道。

我拿开右手，露出了那枚大大的银圆，上面有阿方索十三世(5)的侧身像，就像小孩玩游戏一样。

“是正面。”我说。

“把这些臭钱拿走吧。别小气，请我喝杯酒吧。”他把钱夹里的钱一股脑儿倒给了我，“你不想用这钱买支漂亮的珀迪牌子的枪吗？”

“不想。”我说，“你听我说，路易斯，如果你需要钱的话……”我手里拿着那几张硬硬地折在一起，纸张发亮且手感重，票面为一千比塞塔的绿钞票，直朝他跟前推。

“别犯傻，恩里克，”他说，“赌博就是赌博。”

“不错。可咱们是老熟人了。”

“还没有熟悉到彼此不分的程度。”

“好吧，”我说，“就听你的吧。想喝什么酒呢？”

“来一杯金汤力怎么样？这可是美酒佳酿呀。”

于是，我们一起喝了杯金汤力。让他落了个囊空如洗，我心里老大不忍，然而将钱赢到了手里，那种感觉特别好。我一生都没觉得金汤力的味道竟如此爽口。赢钱感觉很好，没必要说假话，没必要假惺惺地做出不乐意赢钱的样子。话又说回来，路易斯·戴尔卡多那家伙是个输得起钱的赌徒。

“依我看，输得起多少钱就赌多少，那样的玩法意思不大。你说呢，恩里克？”

“不得而知，因为我历来都没有多少钱可输。”

“哪里的话。你的钱多着呢。”

“我没钱，”我说，“这是真的。”

“得了吧。谁还能没点钱呢。”他说，“问题在于你愿不愿把某样东西出售给别人，卖掉东西你不就有钱了。”

“我没有多少钱。这是真的。”

“得啦，别说傻话。我所认识的美国人，没有一个是没钱的。”

我想此言不虚。当年无论是在里兹酒吧还是在奇科特酒吧，他是碰不上没钱的美国人的。而今他重返奇科特酒吧，所遇到的美国人正是他昔日绝不会碰见的那一类。我则另当别论——我真不该来这里。我说什么也不愿在此处看见他。

假如他愿意干这种蠢不可及的事情，那是咎由自取。不过，望着店里的桌子，遥想当年，我心里不禁感到一阵阵的难过。更叫我难过的是，我竟然把安全总部反间谍局的电话号码给了那位侍者。侍者自己打个电话也是可以找到安全总部的。但是我却给他指出了一条逮捕戴尔卡多最便利的捷径。这里面牵扯到的因素极为复杂——其中包括公道、正义、彼拉多(6)手腕以及观察人们遇到心理矛盾时如何行为的那种肮脏的心态。作家之所以能散发出迷人的魅力，靠的就是罗织这些复杂的因素。

这时，那个侍者走了过来。

“你觉得这样妥当吗？”

“要是我，我绝不会告发他。”我说。解铃还须系铃人——我在排除由于提供电话号码而产生的症结了。“不过，我是个外国人，打仗是你们在打仗，问题得由你们自己解决。”

“可是，你是站在我们这一边的呀。”

“自始至终，坚贞不渝。不过，此事关系到的是告发一个老朋友。”

“那我呢？”

“你的情况不一样。”

我认为自己讲的是实话。此时，再也没有别的话可说的了。真希望这种事情压根就没有进入我的耳朵里。

我曾有过好奇心，想了解人们在这类情况中会采取什么样的行动，说来惭愧，这种好奇心早已得到了满足。此时的我转向约翰，不去看路易斯·戴尔卡多坐的那张桌子。据我所知，路易斯·戴尔卡多当了一年多的法西斯飞行员，而今却在此处现身，穿着政府军的军装，在跟三个受训于法国最近才返回的年轻的政府军飞行员交谈着。

那几个新来的小伙子没人认识他。我怀疑他来此处，目的是想偷架飞机或者干别的什么勾当。不管他目的如何，现身于奇科特酒吧纯粹是愚蠢之举。

“你感觉怎么样，约翰？”我问道。

“感觉不错。”约翰说，“这酒很好，喝了稍微有些晕乎，能压住一些脑袋里嗡嗡叫的声音。”

那个侍者走了过来，情绪显得非常激动。

“我告发了他。”他说。

“那就好。”我说，“你的问题解决了。”

“是的。”他颇为自豪地说，“我把他告发了。他们正赶过来逮捕他。”

“咱们走吧。”我对约翰说，“这里要出事了。”

“那就最好走人。”约翰说，“麻烦事真是太多了，让你躲都来不及。酒钱是多少呢？”

“怎么？你不留下吗？”侍者问。

“是的。”

“可是，电话号码是你给我的呀。”

“我恰好知道这个号码，就给了你。在城里生活，总得记许许多多电话号码的。”

“对于我，则是义不容辞的责任。”

“是呀。谁说不是呢？责任是非常强烈的义务。”

“接下来怎么才好呢？”

“哦，此时你有一种心安理得的感觉，是不是？这种心态也许还会持续下去。你会引以为自豪的。”

“你把这包东西忘记拿了。”侍者说着，把装在两个大信封里的牛肉递给了我。信封是《鞭策》杂志社用来寄送杂志的——那些杂志同别的刊物一道堆放在大使馆的一个办公间里。

“我理解你，”我对侍者说，“真的很理解。”

“他是老主顾，一个很好的主顾。以前我从未告发过任何人。这次破例告发可不是为了从中取乐。”

“有句话说出来可不是小看你，不怀有恶意。你就对他说是我告发了他。反正由于政见不同，他对我已怀恨在心。如果他知道告发人是你，一定怨恨你的。”

“不。一人做事一人当。可你真的理解我吗？”

“我真的理解。”我说完，又随口撒了个谎，“我非但理解，还赞同。”兵荒马乱的，撒谎是司空见惯的事。这样的谎话需要脱口而出，而且应该滴水不漏。

跟侍者握手后，我和约翰便走出了店门。出门前，我回头望了望路易斯·戴尔卡多坐的那张桌子，见他的面前仍摆放着一杯金汤力，桌旁的人都在为他说的什么事情哈哈哈大笑。他那黝黑的脸上喜气洋洋，闪动着一双猎手的眼睛。真不知他又在扮演什么角色了。

现身于奇科特酒吧确是愚蠢之举。不过，对于这样的冒险他乐此不疲，为的是回到朋友中去好吹吹牛皮。

待我们出了门，走上大街时，见一辆安全总部的大型轿车吱的一声停在了奇科特酒吧门前，接着下来八个人——六个端冲锋枪的在外边站岗，另两个穿便衣的径直走了进去。一个站岗的要看我们的证件，我说是外国人，便让我们走了，说是没我们的事。

格兰维亚大街上光线很暗，大轰炸后人行道上又出现了许多碎玻璃碴，脚下瓦砾成片。空气中弥漫着硝烟，街头巷尾到处都闻得到烈性炸药爆炸的气味，以及被炸飞的花岗岩散发出的气味。

“你打算去哪里吃饭？”约翰问。

“这儿有些肉够咱俩吃的，回去做着吃吧。”

“让我掌勺吧。”约翰说，“我的厨艺很好。记得以前还在轮船上当过厨子呢……”

“这肉老了些，”我说，“不过是刚宰杀的。”

“哦，不老。”约翰说，“战争期间能吃上肉就不错了，没有老不老之说。”

黑暗中，一些人步履匆匆地往家赶——他们待在电影院，等到轰炸过后才出来。

“那个法西斯分子是怎么啦？跑到奇科特酒吧来，就不怕别人认出来？”

“他是发了疯了。”

“都是战争惹的祸。”约翰说，“弄得许多人都丧失了理智。”

“约翰，”我说道，“你这话不无道理。”

回到旅馆，走过为了保护服务台而堆起的沙袋，我问服务员要房间的钥匙，可他说有两个同僚上楼到客房里洗澡，他把钥匙给了他们。

“你先上去吧，约翰，”我说，“我想去打个电话。”

我去电话亭，拨了我给那位侍者的号码。

“喂，是皮珀吗？”

听筒里传来了一种薄嘴唇发出的声音：“你好吗，恩里克？(7)”

“喂，皮珀，你们在奇科特酒吧抓了个名叫路易斯·戴尔卡多的人吧？”

“是的，兄弟，是的，都很顺利。(8)一帆风顺。”

“他不知道是那个侍者告发的吧？”

“不知道，兄弟。他不知道。”

“那就别告诉他。你对他讲，就说是我告发的，好不好？不要提那个侍者。”

“是谁告发的又有什么关系呢？他是个间谍，反正是要被枪毙的。这种事，他只有死路一条。”

“这我清楚。”我说，“不过，关系还是有的。”

“那就听你的，兄弟。那就听你的。什么时候能见你？”

“明天你来吃午饭。我们这儿搞到一些牛肉。”

“饭前还有威士忌喝。太好了，兄弟，太好了。”

“再见，皮珀。谢谢你啦。”

“再见，恩里克。别客气，没什么。再见。”

听筒里的声音有点怪，含着杀气，让人听上去很不习惯。不过，上楼时，我的心情好多了。

但凡出入于奇科特酒吧的老顾客，对那儿都有一种特殊的感情。我知道正是出于这种感情，才使得路易斯·戴尔卡多铤而走险，返回酒吧。按说，他完全可以不来。可是，回到马德里，他便身不由己，一定会来了。如那个侍者所言，他是个好顾客，而我们彼此是朋友。人生中，不应该因为善小而不为。我很高兴自己给安全总部的老朋友皮珀打了电话——路易斯·戴尔卡多是奇科特酒吧的老顾客，我可不愿让他在临死之前坏掉对那个酒吧的美好印象或者对那里的侍者心怀怨恨。

忠贞的公牛


从前有头公牛，它的名字不叫费迪南德(1)，对鲜花丝毫不感兴趣。它所喜欢的是战斗，跟所有同龄的公牛斗，也跟其他年龄段的公牛斗，而且战无不胜。

它的犄角和硬木一样坚硬，同豪猪的刺那般锋利。决斗时，它的犄角根会发痛，但它毫不理会。它颈部的肌肉隆起，聚成一大团，西班牙语叫作morillo。它准备冲锋陷阵时，这团morillo便高高耸起，似一座小山——它时时刻刻都在准备着上阵拼搏。它的毛皮黑亮黑亮，一双眼睛非常清朗。

它一旦因故产生了战斗的欲望，那它一定会认认真真地拼死一搏，其认真的态度就跟有些人吃饭、读书和上教堂那样一板一眼的。每次战斗，它都一斗到底，非得置对手于死地不可。别的公牛也不怕它，因为它们都是些良种牛，都是天不怕地不怕的好牛。不过，那些牛并不愿招惹它，不想跟它一决雌雄。

它并非一头专横跋扈的牛，也非坏心眼的恶牛，只是喜欢战斗而已，这就跟人们喜欢唱歌，喜欢当国王或者总统一样。它从不思考。战斗是它的义务，是它的责任和欢乐。

它在石头高地上战斗，在栓皮栎树下战斗，也在河边丰茂的草场上战斗。每一天，它都会从河边走十五英里的路到石头高地上寻斗。别的公牛哪怕看它一眼，它也会与之战斗。

要说它从不恼怒，那可是与事实不符，因为它的心里会怒火燃烧。它恼怒，却不知发怒的原因，因为它不善于思考。它是一头高贵的牛，一头喜欢战斗的牛。

知道它后来发生了什么事吗？它的主人（这般高贵的牛竟然还从属于他人）心里明白它是头了不起的公牛，但这头公牛跟别的牛搏斗，使得他损失惨重，这叫他忧心忡忡。一头价值一千多美元的牛，跟这头了不起的牛斗上一场，身价会暴跌，连两百美元都值不了了，有的时候会少于这个数。

它的主人是个心软的好人，不愿把它送到斗牛场上战死，而是决定将它留在自家牛群里交配，以传宗接代。就这样，它被选中做了种牛。

可是这头种牛行为古怪。第一次把它放到牧场去，跟那些育龄母牛在一起，它一眼就看中了一头年轻漂亮的母牛——那母牛与别的母牛相比身材更苗条，肌肉更发达，毛皮更光亮，样子更可爱。既然不能再去战斗了，于是它就移情母牛，爱上了这头漂亮的母牛。对于其他的母牛它看也不看一眼，只想守在这头母牛的身边，别的母牛它都不屑一顾。

养牛场的主人希望它有所改变，希望它学会和别的母牛相处，或者说脱胎换骨。可这头公牛是个死心眼，对爱情特别专注，只爱自己的心上人。它只想跟心上人在一起，对于别的母牛视若无物。

万般无奈，主人只好把它和另外的五头牛送到斗牛场上迎接死亡。它不但在情场上感情忠贞，在斗牛场上也毫不含糊。它表现得极为出色，赢得了所有人的钦佩，而最为钦佩它的当数那个最终杀掉它的人。结果掉它性命的那个人叫斗牛士，战斗结束时已大汗淋漓，连外衣都湿透了，喉咙里干得直冒烟。

“这头公牛真勇敢。(2)”斗牛士把手里的剑递给助手时说了这么一句。他递剑时剑柄朝上，剑锋上滴着血，而每一滴血都来自那头勇敢公牛的心脏。那头公牛毙命后所有的问题都迎刃而解了，此时正被四匹马拖出斗牛场。

“不错，它就是比利亚马约尔侯爵的那头公牛。由于它对爱情过于忠贞，侯爵只好把它打发掉了。”那位无所不知的助手说。

“也许，我们人类也应该对爱情忠贞不渝。”斗牛士说。

一段非洲的往事


他在等着月亮升起，一边用手抚摸着他的狗基博，让它不要作声，可以感觉到狗毛都竖了起来。人和狗都在观望，都在倾听，眼看着月亮冉冉升起，由月光把他们的身影投在地上。他用胳膊搂住狗脖子，感觉得到它在发抖。夜间万籁俱寂。他们没有听见大象的脚步声。直待那条狗转头一望，吓得一缩身子紧靠他，戴维这才发现了大象。大象近在咫尺，身影遮住了他们，走过时悄无声息。山里吹来一股微风，将大象的气味送入了他们的鼻孔——那是一种刺鼻、陈腐、酸臭的气味。它擦身而过，戴维看见它左边的那根象牙特别长，好像都快触着地面了。

戴维和狗又等了等，见再没有别的象过来，于是便在月光下撒腿跑了起来。狗紧随在戴维的后面。戴维一停下来，狗鼻子就会撞在他的腿肚子上。

戴维决意要追上那头公象。到了森林边时，他们终于撵上了它。公象在朝山里走，迎着夜间阵阵微风缓步而行。戴维靠近，又看到了它月光下的影子，闻到了它身上的那股陈腐的酸臭味，却看不见它右边的象牙。他不敢再带着狗往近处走，于是顺着风向将狗引开，让它贴着一棵树的树根卧下，竭力想让它理解自己的意图。他以为狗会卧在那儿不动，谁知当他朝着大象那巨大的身躯靠近时，却感到湿湿的狗鼻子又贴在了他的腿肚子上。

他们俩如影随形地跟着大象，随它走到了林间的一片空地上。但见它站在那儿，摆动着巨大的耳朵。它的身子隐没在阴影里，而头部却沐浴在月光下。戴维悄悄从后边摸上去，轻轻用手箍住狗的嘴不让它出声，蹑手蹑脚前行，擦着夜风的边把头转向右呼吸，只感到微风吹拂在脸上——他始终顺着风向擦边走，绝不逆风而行让自己的气味飘到大象那儿。到了跟前，他可以看见大象在徐徐摆动着脑袋和巨大的耳朵，可以看见右边的象牙跟他的大腿一般粗，有点弯曲，几乎能挨着地面。

他和基博朝后退去；这下子，风吹在了他的脖子上，他们顺原路走出森林，来到了空旷的野地。狗跑到了他前边去，在小径旁的两根猎矛跟前停了下来。这两根猎矛是戴维跟踪大象时插在那儿做标记的。他把猎矛连同上面的皮圈皮套一起扛上肩，手里拿着他那根从不离身的最得意的长矛顺着小径返回营地去。此时月亮已爬高。营地那儿静悄悄，听不到鼓声，这叫他感到纳闷。如果父亲在营地，却不闻鼓声，这就让人觉得蹊跷了。




刚刚寻觅到大象踪迹的时候，戴维已经感到浑身疲倦了。在这之前的很长一段时间，他都显得比那两个大人精力充沛，身体状态良好。寻象的过程当中，那两人慢慢腾腾的，父亲规定每一个小时休息一次，这叫他很不耐烦。他原本是可以跑到前边去的，速度可以比父亲及朱马快得多。可是，等到他感到累了的时候，那两人状况依旧。中午时分，他们按照惯例又只休息了五分钟。之后，他发现朱马的脚步加快了一些。也许并没有加快，只是看上去提速罢了。此时，象粪比以前新鲜了，尽管摸上去仍没有热气。上次见到一堆象粪之后，朱马将猎枪交给他扛，可是扛了有一个小时的时间，朱马看看他疲惫的面色，又把猎枪要了回去。他们一行沿着山坡一路穿行，可是后来大象的足印下山去了，从森林的缺口可以望得见远处坑洼不平的原野。“下来的路可就难走了，戴维。”父亲说道。

这时他才意识到，在戴维领着他们找到大象的踪迹时，就应该让戴维回营地了。朱马老早就知道这是有必要的，而作为父亲的他是方才醒悟过来的。开弓已没有回头之箭了。这是他犯下的又一个错误，现在没有办法，只有赌一赌运气了。

戴维低头看看大象留下的巨大、扁平、圆圆的足印，发现有一簇凤尾草被踩倒，一株断了茎的杂草正在枯死。朱马捡起那株杂草，抬头看了看太阳，然后将杂草递给了戴维的父亲，而父亲将杂草拿在手里左看右看的。戴维注意到杂草结出的白花已经发蔫，在渐渐凋零，却仍没有被太阳晒干，花瓣尚没有脱落。

“快找到了。”戴维的父亲说，“咱们走吧。”

下午天色渐晚，他们仍行进在坑洼不平的原野上。戴维早已犯困了，望一望身边的两个大人，情知困意成了他的头号大敌。于是紧跟上大人的步点，尽量不掉队，竭力要摆脱掉袭上身来的困劲。追踪大象，两个大人轮流换班，一小时一班，下了班的那个会时不时回头查看，看戴维是不是仍跟在后边。天黑后在森林里选了块干燥的地方扎营。戴维倒头便睡，醒来时看见朱马手拿软皮平底鞋，光着脚片在检查脚上是否有血泡。他睡着后，父亲脱下外套盖在了他身上，此时坐在他旁边正在吃一块煮熟的冷肉和两片面包。见他醒来，父亲将装有凉茶的水壶递给他让他喝。

“大象也是需要吃喝的。”父亲说，“你的脚没事，跟朱马的脚一样结实。慢慢吃点东西，喝点茶，然后继续睡你的觉。我们俩是没事的。”

“对不起，我太困了。”

“你和基博寻找大象，跑了一整夜，哪能不困呢。想吃，就再吃些肉吧。”

“不饿了。”

“好吧。饮用水还够三天喝的呢。明天就又有水源了。山里的溪水多着呢。”

“那只大象是要到哪里去？”

“朱马觉得他能摸得透。”

“不会弄得竹篮打水一场空吧。”

“没那么糟糕，戴维。”

“那我就继续睡我的觉了。”戴维说，“不用盖你的外套了。”

没等父亲跟他说声晚安，戴维就睡着了。他中间醒了一次，看见月光照到了脸上，不由想起了大象站在森林里扑扇着大耳朵的情景——由于象牙太重，脑袋都垂下来了。这天夜里回忆起大象，他有一种空落落的感觉，便以为是醒来肚子饿导致的。其实并非如此——这是他在接下来的三天里才发现的。




次日的情况非常糟糕，远没有到中午之前，戴维就发现小孩和大人之间的差别并不仅仅在于缺觉。头三个小时，他的精神头比大人大，自告奋勇地问朱马要那只.303口径的步枪扛，而朱马摇了摇头，脸上一点笑容也没有。朱马一直都是他最好的朋友，曾手把手地教他打猎。他心中暗忖：他昨天还提出让我扛枪呢，今天我的状态比昨天好，却不让我扛了。当时他的精神头固然不错，可是到了十点钟的时候，他就发现今天的状况跟昨天一样糟糕，或者说更糟糕。

他原以为自己追踪大象跟父亲一般棒，就和他以为打猎打得跟父亲一般好，现在看来这种想法太愚蠢了。他知道个中的原因并非仅仅因为他们是成年人。他们可是职业猎手呀！他现在终于明白了朱马不苟言笑的原因。两个大人对大象的一举一动都了如指掌，遇见情况，两人无须说话，只要打个手势便可以心领神会。碰到难以判断的现象，父亲总是听朱马的。看见前边有一条小溪，他们留住脚步给水壶灌水。父亲说：“别多灌，够今天喝的就行了，戴维。”当他们跨越了坑洼不平的原野，爬山向森林进发时，大象的足印朝右一拐，拐上了一条古老的象径。他看见父亲和朱马在商量。当他走过去时，朱马回首望了望他们刚才走过的路，然后又眺望了一眼远方干涸的地区那一座座像孤岛一样的石头山，似乎在根据远方天地交接之处三座碧绿的山峰目测此处的方位。

“朱马现在知道大象要到哪里去了。”父亲解释说，“他以前就认为自己是心中有数的，可后来大象一拐弯，跑到了这里来。”父亲边说边回头望了一眼他们花了一天的时间才穿越的那片原野，“接下来的路就相当顺了，只是仍需要爬爬山。”

他们一行翻山越岭，直至天黑，然后找了块干燥的地方扎营。就在眼看太阳就要落山的时候，有一小群鸡鹑横穿小径，戴维急忙取过弹弓打杀了两只。鸡鹑走上古老的象径时，一副闲庭信步的样子，只只都肥嘟嘟的。其中的一只背部中矢，扑扇着翅膀，一跌一撞的，另一只跑上前施救，戴维又装上一粒石子，一拉弹弓，射出去的石子击中了第二只鸡鹑的肋骨。他跑过去捡猎物，惊得其他的鸡鹑呼地四散逃窜。朱马回头看看，这次罕见地露出了笑容。戴维将两只中矢的鸡鹑捡起，见它们都肥肥的，羽毛平整，拿在手里暖乎乎的。然后，他把鸡鹑的头在猎刀的柄上摔打了几下，结果了它们的性命。

扎营过夜时，父亲说道：“这么肥的鸡鹑以前从没见过。好样的，你一次就打中了两只。”

朱马将两只鸡鹑串在一根棍子上，架在一小堆炭火上烤。父亲往烧瓶的瓶盖里倒了些威士忌，加了点水，一边喝，一边和戴维斜靠在那儿观望朱马忙活。鸡鹑烤好后，朱马将胸肉和心分发给了父子俩，自己吃鸡鹑的脖子、脊背和腿。

“你的贡献可真是不小，戴维。”父亲说，“现在，咱们的干粮充足得多了。”

“距离大象还有多远？”戴维问。

“已经非常近了。”父亲说，“关键要看月亮升起时它是否继续前行。今夜的月亮出来要比昨夜晚一个小时，比你发现它的那天夜里晚两个小时。”

“朱马怎么那么有信心，觉得自己知道它要到哪里去？”

“就在离此不远的地方，朱马曾经开枪打伤了它，猎杀了它的‘卫兵’。”

“什么时候？”

“据他说，那是五年前的事了。他的说法也不一定准确。他说你当时还是个‘托托’(1)呢。”

“这头象成了光杆司令啦？”

“他说是的。他再没见过它，只是从别人口中听说过它。”

“他说这头象有多大？”

“光象牙都差不多有两百磅吧，比我所见过的象都要大。他说只有一头比这还大，也是出没于这一带。”

“我该睡觉了，”戴维说，“希望明天精力能充沛些。”

“你今天表现得很出色，”父亲说，“我为你感到非常自豪。朱马也跟我一样。”

夜间月亮升起后，戴维一觉醒来，不由胡思乱想起来，觉得两个大人也许很欣赏他眼明手快地射杀了两只鸟禽，在别的方面不会为他感到自豪的。另外，是他那天夜里发现了这头象，并一路追踪，看见两只象牙都还在，然后返回找到两个大人，带他们寻了过来。这一点，恐怕也会叫他们感到自豪的。可是，危险的追踪一旦开始，他就派不上用场了，还可能会坏了他们的事，就跟那天夜里他靠近大象，差点没让基博搅了局一样。最初在时间还充裕时，他们却没有打发他回去，此时一定会为此而自恨自怨了。这头象有两根象牙，每一根重达二百磅。正是因为象牙超常的大，才使得这头大象遭到追杀。此时他们三个要猎杀这头象，也是为了这两根巨牙。

戴维有信心，认为他们一定能如愿以偿。这一天，他咬牙坚持了下来。中午时分，行进的速度拖垮了他，但他仍继续紧追不舍。这种坚韧不拔的精神恐怕也会叫大人为他而感到自豪的。不过，他毕竟没有做出实际的贡献，没有他这个累赘，大人们会轻松得多呢。在白天，他曾经三番五次产生悔意，觉得自己不该把有关大象的线索说出来，记得下午的时候他还希望自己压根就没有看见这头象。此刻在月光下醒来，他又觉得以前的想法并非自己的真意。




次日早晨，他们跟着大象的足印走上了一条古老的象径——那象径穿过森林，已被大象踩得硬硬的。看上去，就好像火山的熔岩一冷却，该地区长出又高又密的林子，就有大象在这条小径上走了。

朱马信心十足，他们行进的速度很快。朱马和父亲显得极为笃定，行走在象径上一副轻轻松松的样子。穿过时明时暗的密林时，朱马甚至还把他的.303口径的猎枪交给了戴维扛。后来遇见几堆还冒着热气的大象粪便和一些圆圆的、扁平的足印（这些都是从小径左侧密林里出来的一群象留下的），他们便迷失了那头巨牙象的踪迹。朱马极为恼火，一把将那支.303口径的猎枪从戴维手里拿了过去。到了下午，他们才找到象群，悄悄地挨近，从树干间的缝隙望得见大象灰色的身躯，看见它们扑扇着大耳朵，长鼻子一卷一伸，听见咔嚓咔嚓树枝被折断以及树木被象鼻子卷倒的声音，还听见大象肚子里传出的咕噜咕噜的声音和象粪落地的噼啪声。

最后，他们终于发现了那头老公象的踪迹——老公象的足印拐了个弯，转到了一条比较狭窄的象径上。朱马瞧瞧戴维的父亲，咧嘴一笑，露出了一口大黄牙。父亲点了点头。他们俩的样子，就好像有什么不可告人的秘密似的，那天夜里戴维在营地找到他俩，他们就是这副表情。

没过多久，谜底就揭开了。秘密就藏在右侧的森林里——老公象的足印便是通向那里的。原来是一个大象的头骨，高度达到戴维的胸前，因日晒雨淋已发白。头骨的前额上有一处深深的凹陷，鼻梁两旁是两个发白的、空空的眼窝，原来的象牙已被凿走，留下的是两个带有凿痕的空窟窿。

朱马指了指他们追踪的那头大象曾经站过的地方——那头大象曾伫立在头骨前，低头看着它。那头大象曾用鼻子将头骨从原地移开了一点，移到了此处，头骨旁留有它的长牙尖触地的痕印。他还让戴维看白骨额头凹陷处的一个弹孔，以及耳朵根密布的四个弹孔。他冲戴维笑笑，又冲戴维的父亲笑笑，从口袋里掏出一颗.303口径的子弹，将弹头塞进头骨前额的弹孔里，刚好塞得下。

“朱马就是在这儿打伤那头大公象的。”父亲说，“这头骨是它的‘卫兵’的。那也是一头大公象，其实就是它的朋友。它冲过来，朱马一枪撂倒了它，又在耳朵根补几枪要了它的命。”

朱马指给他们看了看满地的碎骨，描述了那头大公象是怎样徘徊于碎骨场。戴维父子对这一发现颇为高兴。

“你看这两个朋友在一起有多长时间了？”戴维问父亲。

“这我就一点不知道了。”父亲说，“你问朱马吧。”

“你还是问他吧。”

父亲和朱马交谈了几句。朱马瞧瞧戴维，哈哈地笑了。

“他说它们在一起的时间之长大概四五倍于你的年龄。”父亲对戴维说，“其实他也不清楚，也不关心这个。”

戴维心想：“我关心这个。我在月光下看到它时，它孤苦伶仃的。而我有基博做伴，基博也有我相陪。它又不伤害任何人，而我们却追踪它，来到它凭吊亡友的地方，非置它于死地不可。要怪都怪我，是我出卖了它。”

朱马找到了那头大象的踪迹，对父亲做了个手势，他们一行又出发了。

戴维暗忖：“我父亲又没必要靠猎象糊口。要是当初我没看见这头象，把它告诉大人，朱马是找不到它的。他曾碰运气发现了它，打伤了它，杀害了它的朋友。我和基博发现它后，千不该万不该，不该告诉大人，而应该为它保密，把秘密永远埋藏在心里，就让两个大人喝他们的酒，醉他们的吧。那时的朱马醉得不省人事，叫都叫不醒呢。今后不管有什么事都要藏在心里，再也不讲出去了。杀了大象卖掉象牙，朱马又会醉生梦死，要不然就再给自己娶个老婆。我真傻，当初为什么就没有帮帮这头大象呢？当初，第二天不跟着来就好了。那也不行，因为那样无法拖住他们。朱马照样还会来的。悔不该把大象的踪迹告诉了他们。千不该万不该，不该告诉他们。以此为戒，以后有事情绝不告诉他人。不管再发生什么事情，决不讲出去。”

父亲等着他赶上来后，轻声细语地对他说：“那只象在这儿休息过。现在，它走路不像以前走得那么快了。咱们随时都可以追上它。”

“猎什么象，猎个狗屎！”戴维小声嘟哝了一句。

“你说什么？”父亲问他。

“猎什么象，猎个狗屎！”戴维又低声重复了一遍。

“你小心点，可别把事情搞砸了。”父亲冲他说道，然后又狠狠瞪了他一眼。

“总算把事情摊开了。”戴维心想，“他可不笨，这下子了解我的心思了，以后再也不会信任我了。这样倒好，我才不稀罕让他信任呢。反正以后有事情我决不告诉他，也不告诉任何人，再怎么也不告诉他们。我发誓：绝不告诉任何人！”




这天上午，他们追到了远处的山坡上。那只象不再似以前那般匆匆赶路了，而是漫无目的地游荡，时不时停下来吃上点东西。戴维知道他们正一点点接近它。

他竭力想回忆回忆自己以前对大象的感受，觉得自己对它并无感情可言。对此，他必须铭记在心。他只是太累了，由此推想到了老年的不易，继而产生了伤感。正是由于自己年幼体弱，他才能体会到衰弱暮年的惨景。

想到基博，他倍感孤独，再想想是朱马枪杀了那只大象的朋友，便有兔死狐悲之感，对朱马恨恨不已，仿佛大象和他有手足之情。那天在月光下看到那只象，紧紧地跟着它，到了空地时距离大象仅有咫尺之遥，巨大的象牙能看得清清楚楚，他知道那幅情景对自己产生了深远的影响。可是，他所不知道的是那样美好的情景再也不会出现了。父亲和朱马要杀死那头象，而自己却无法阻止。是他出卖了大象，竟然跑回营地把大象的踪迹告诉了大人。他心想，要是我和基博长了象牙，他们也会杀我们的。不过，他知道这仅仅是不着边的胡想而已。

那只象可能要去寻找它出生的地方，而大人们就是要在那儿杀死它，使这件事有个圆满的收场。本来，他们是想在杀死它朋友的地方就地要它的命。真是一场闹剧。杀死大象，这才会叫他们称心如意。这两个杀象的凶手实在可恶！

此时，他们追到了遮天蔽日的密林的边上，大象就在前方不远的地方，戴维都可以闻到它身上的气味了。只听见大象折树枝弄出咔嚓咔嚓的响动。父亲把手搭在戴维的肩上，让他朝后退，等在密林的外边，然后从衣袋里取出个布袋，掏出一大把灰扬到空中。灰从空中飘落时，微微朝着他们这个方向落下。父亲冲着朱马点点头，弓腰跟随他进了密林深处。戴维望着他们的背影——那两人的臀部时隐时现，悄无声息，听不见任何响动。

戴维纹丝不动，静听大象吃东西发出的声音。就像那天夜里月光下摸到它跟前，看见了它漂亮的巨牙时一样，他可以闻到它那浓烈的体味。等了一会，那声音消失了，气味也闻不到了。突然，那支.303口径的猎枪响了，声音尖利、刺耳。接着，父亲的那支.450口径的猎枪也响了，响了两声，震天动地的。随后，枪声噼里啪啦响成了一片，像炒豆一样。他一头钻进了林子，见朱马一副惶恐的样子，额头上鲜血如注，流得满脸都是。父亲脸色煞白，怒不可遏。

“它冲过来，把朱马撞倒了。”父亲说，“朱马击中了它的头部。”

“你击中了它的哪个部位？”

“我没管哪个部位，哪儿好打就打哪儿。”父亲说，“快顺着血迹朝前追。”

只见到处都是大象的血。有一股血喷得有戴维的头那么高，染红了树干、树叶和藤蔓；还有一股比这一股要低多了，是黑红色的，散发出大象胃里的酸臭味。

“它的内脏中了枪弹。”父亲说，“它肯定倒下去了，或者动不了了——但愿如此。”他在后面补充了一句。

他们找到大象，见它果然动不了了。伤痛和绝望交织在一起，使得它寸步难移。它从觅食的地方穿过茂密的林子，又走过一片稀疏的林带，挣扎着来到了这里。戴维和父亲是循着血迹斑斑的大象的足印找来的。当时大象钻进了一片稠密的林子，戴维看见它站在那里，灰色的庞大身躯靠在树干上。从后边看，只能看见它的臀部。父亲朝前摸去，戴维紧随其后。父子俩走到大象的身边，觉得它大得就像艘轮船。它的腰部鲜血泉涌而出，顺着两侧哗哗地朝下流淌。父亲举枪射击，大象把头连同那两根巨大的象牙缓慢而沉重地转过来，用眼睛望着他们。当父亲的第二声枪响时，大象摇晃了几下，像是一棵被伐倒的大树一样，轰隆朝着他们倒了下来，然而尚未断气。原先它只是动弹不得，现在肩胛骨被打碎，才倒了下来。它一动不动，但眼睛却充满了生气，直直地盯着戴维。它的眼睫毛很长，一双眼睛生机蓬勃——戴维从未见过如此充满生命力的东西。

“用那支.303口径的枪朝它的耳朵眼里打。”父亲说，“快点。”

“要打你自己打吧。”戴维说。

这时，朱马满脸是血地一瘸一拐走了过来，额头上的皮掉下来遮在左眼上方，鼻梁骨都露了出来，一只耳朵伤得不轻。他一声不响地从戴维手中拿过枪来，将枪口一伸，几乎塞进了大象的耳朵眼里，怒气冲冲地把枪栓一拉一推，连开了两枪。第一声枪响时，大象的眼睛还睁得大大的，随后便开始变得呆滞，鲜血从它的耳朵里奔涌而出，形成两条鲜红的溪流，顺着满是皱纹的灰色象皮潺潺流淌。这些血的颜色与别的血是不一样的。戴维心想，这幅情景我必须记住。他记住是记住了，但仅仅记住是解决不了问题的。大象原来的那种雍容的气质、尊贵的神态以及威风凛凛的容貌已不复存在，转眼间它变成了一大堆皱巴巴的皮肉。

“啊，总算结束了，戴维。有你一份功劳呢。”父亲说，“应该生堆火，让我给朱马包扎包扎伤口。到这儿来，你这个满身是血的矮胖子(2)。先不要急着摆弄那象牙。”

朱马笑嘻嘻地走了过来，手里拎着象尾巴，上面没有毛，光秃秃的。两人开了个下流玩笑。接着，父亲说起了斯瓦希里语，语速很快：“此处离水源地有多远？还要走多远才能找到人把这两根象牙运出去？怎么样，你这个狗日的饭桶？伤在哪里了？”

听了朱马的回答后，父亲对戴维说：“你和我一起去把丢在那儿的背包取回来。朱马留在这儿捡柴生火。医药箱在我的包里放着呢。咱们赶天黑之前回来。朱马的伤不是抓伤，不会感染的。走吧。”




傍晚时分，戴维坐在火堆旁望着脸上被缝了几针、断了几根肋骨的朱马，不由浮想联翩：“大象试图撞死他，是不是认出了他就是杀害它朋友的凶手？”他希望情况是这样。如今，大象成了他心目中的英雄，就像他长久以来视父亲为英雄一样。他心想：“它如此年迈，又是那样疲倦，竟然还能拼死一搏，让人难以相信。它显然是要置朱马于死地。但它看我的时候，似乎并无害我之意，只是显得很伤心，跟我心里的感受是一样的。就在它的死亡日，它还去看望了自己的老朋友。”

戴维仍记得，大象的眼睛一旦失去了生气，它所有雍容高贵的气质便烟消云散了。他和父亲取背包归来时，尽管傍晚时分空气凉爽，大象却已开始肿胀。那只大象已不复存在，成了一具死尸，有着灰色的皱巴巴的皮，全身浮肿，他们为之而起杀机的两根巨大的象牙上满是褐色和黄色的斑点。他见象牙上沾了血，已经凝固，便用指甲抠了一些下来，就像抠掉信封上的火漆一样，将其放入衬衣口袋里。除了从大象那儿获取了有关什么叫孤独的知识以外，再就是这点血块了。

那天夜里在火堆旁，在拔出象牙之后，父亲想和他说会儿话。

“这头象是有人命在身的，戴维。”父亲说道，“据朱马说，没人清楚它到底杀死过多少人。”

“是那些人先要杀它的，对不对？”

“当然喽，”父亲说，“有那么两根象牙，谁不眼红。”

“那怎么能说它是个杀人犯呢？”

“随你怎么想吧。”父亲说，“很遗憾，你对那头象竟有如此糊涂的想法。”

“真希望它把朱马也杀死才好呢。”戴维说。

“我觉得这话说得有点太过分了。”父亲说，“要知道，朱马可是你的朋友呀。”

“已经不是了。”

“你可不能对他说这话。”

“他自己心里是清楚的。”

“我觉得你错怪了他。”父亲说。

父子两人的对话到此也就结束了。

后来，他们费尽千辛万苦，总算把象牙安安全全运了回去。两根象牙靠在枝条和泥巴筑成的房屋墙壁上，尖挨着尖。那象牙简直太高了，太粗了，叫人即便用手摸着都不敢相信这是真的。在两个尖相挨的地方，两根象牙都各有弯弯的弧度，没人能够得着那打弯处的顶部，连戴维的父亲也力所不及。朱马和他们父子俩成了英雄，基博成了英雄的狗，那几个抬象牙的人也成了英雄——那几个抬夫喝了酒有些醉意，还执意要喝，非得喝个酩酊大醉不可。

就在这时，只听父亲说道：“你愿意和解吗，戴维？”

“好吧。”戴维应了一声，心里却想到他反正已决定以后再不把自己的想法往外讲了。

“这叫我高兴，”(3)亲说，“这样事情就简单得多，好办得多了。”

父子两人坐在无花果树荫下的长者席上喝着啤酒，那两根象牙靠在小屋的墙壁上。啤酒盛在葫芦杯里，由一个年轻姑娘和她的弟弟（英雄的专职侍童）一杯杯端上席。小侍童和英雄的狗基博一道守在身边，席地而坐。就连小英雄戴维的那只小公鸡也身价百倍，被提升为英雄的随身侍从。他们喝着啤酒，听见大鼓声骤起，鼓点越来越急。

The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber


It was now lunch time and they were all sitting under the double green fly of the dining tent pretending that nothing had happened.

“Will you have lime juice or lemon squash?”Macomber asked.

“I'll have a gimlet,”Robert Wilson told him.

“I'll have a gimlet too. I need something,”Macomber's wife said.

“I suppose it's the thing to do,”Macomber agreed.“Tell him to make three gimlets.”

The mess boy had started them already, lifting the bottles out of the canvas cooling bags that sweated wet in the wind that blew through the trees that shaded the tents.

“What had I ought to give them?”Macomber asked.

“A quid would be plenty,”Wilson told him.“You don't want to spoil them.”

“Will the headman distribute it?”

“Absolutely.”

Francis Macomber had, half an hour before, been carried to his tent from the edge of the camp in triumph on the arms and shoulders of the cook, the personal boys, the skinner and the porters. The gun-bearers had taken no part in the demonstration. When the native boys put him down at the door of his tent, he had shaken all their hands, received their congratulations, and then gone into the tent and sat on the bed until his wife came in. She did not speak to him when she came in and he left the tent at once to wash his face and hands in the portable wash basin outside and go over to the dining tent to sit in a comfortable canvas chair in the breeze and the shade.

“You've got your lion,”Robert Wilson said to him,“and a damned fine one too.”

Mrs. Macomber looked at Wilson quickly. She was an extremely handsome and well-kept woman of the beauty and social position which had, five years before, commanded five thousand dollars as the price of endorsing, with photographs, a beauty product which she had never used. She had been married to Francis Macomber for eleven years.

“He is a good lion, isn't he?”Macomber said. His wife looked at him now. She looked at both these men as though she had never seen them before.

One, Wilson, the white hunter, she knew she had never truly seen before. He was about middle height with sandy hair, a stubby mustache, a very red face and extremely cold blue eyes with faint white wrinkles at the corners that grooved merrily when he smiled. He smiled at her now and she looked away from his face at the way his shoulders sloped in the loose tunic he wore with the four big cartridges held in loops where the left breast pocket should have been, at his big brown hands, his old slacks, his very dirty boots and back to his red face again. She noticed where the baked red of his face stopped in a white line that marked the circle left by his Stetson hat that hung now from one of the pegs of the tent pole.

“Well, here's to the lion,”Robert Wilson said. He smiled at her again and, not smiling, she looked curiously at her husband.

Francis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did not mind that length of bone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather thin-lipped, and was considered handsome. He was dressed in the same sort of safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new, he was thirty-five years old, kept himself very fit, was good at court games, had a number of big-game fishing records, and had just shown himself, very publicly, to be a coward.

“Here's to the lion,”he said.“I can't ever thank you for what you did.”

Margaret, his wife, looked away from him and back to Wilson.

“Let's not talk about the lion,”she said.

Wilson looked over at her without smiling and now she smiled at him.

“It's been a very strange day,”she said.“Hadn't you ought to put your hat on even under the canvas at noon? You told me that, you know.”

“Might put it on,”said Wilson.

“You know you have a very red face, Mr. Wilson,”she told him and smiled again.

“Drink,”said Wilson.

“I don't think so,”she said.“Francis drinks a great deal, but his face is never red.”

“It's red today,”Macomber tried a joke.

“No,”said Margaret.“It's mine that's red today. But Mr. Wilson's is always red.”

“Must be racial,”said Wilson.“I say, you wouldn't like to drop my beauty as a topic, would you?”

“I've just started on it.”

“Let's chuck it,”said Wilson.

“Conversation is going to be so difficult,”Margaret said.

“Don't be silly, Margot,”her husband said.

“No difficulty,”Wilson said.“Got a damn fine lion.”

Margot looked at them both and they both saw that she was going to cry. Wilson had seen it coming for a long time and he dreaded it. Macomber was past dreading it.

“I wish it hadn't happened. Oh, I wish it hadn't happened,”she said and started for her tent. She made no noise of crying but they could see that her shoulders were shaking under the rose-colored, sun-proofed shirt she wore.

“Women upset,”said Wilson to the tall man.“Amounts to nothing. Strain on the nerves and one thing'n another.”

“No,”said Macomber.“I suppose that I rate that for the rest of my life now.”

“Nonsense. Let's have a spot of the giant killer,”said Wilson.“Forget the whole thing. Nothing to it anyway.”

“We might try,”said Macomber.“I won't forget what you did for me though.”

“Nothing,”said Wilson.“All nonsense.”

So they sat there in the shade where the camp was pitched under some wide-topped acacia trees with a boulder-strewn cliff behind them, and a stretch of grass that ran to the bank of a boulder-filled stream in front with forest beyond it, and drank their just-cool lime drinks and avoided one another's eyes while the boys set the table for lunch. Wilson could tell that the boys all knew about it now and when he saw Macomber's personal boy looking curiously at his master while he was putting dishes on the table he snapped at him in Swahili. The boy turned away with his face blank.

“What were you telling him?”Macomber asked.

“Nothing. Told him to look alive or I'd see he got about fifteen of the best.”“What's that? Lashes?”

“It's quite illegal,”Wilson said.“You're supposed to fine them.”

“Do you still have them whipped?”

“Oh, yes. They could raise a row if they chose to complain. But they don't. They prefer it to the fines.”

“How strange!”said Macomber.

“Not strange, really,”Wilson said.“Which would you rather do? Take a good birching or lose your pay?”

Then he felt embarrassed at asking it and before Macomber could answer he went on,“We all take a beating every day, you know, one way or another.”

This was no better.“Good God,”he thought.“I am a diplomat, aren't I?”

“Yes, we take a beating,”said Macomber, still not looking at him.“I'm awfully sorry about that lion business. It doesn't have to go any further, does it? I mean no one will hear about it, will they?”

“You mean will I tell it at the Mathaiga Club?”Wilson looked at him now coldly. He had not expected this. So he's a bloody four-letter man as well as a bloody coward, he thought. I rather liked him too until today. But how is one to know about an American?

“No,”said Wilson.“I'm a professional hunter. We never talk about our clients. You can be quite easy on that. It's supposed to be bad form to ask us not to talk though.”

He had decided now that to break would be much easier. He would eat, then, by himself and could read a book with his meals. They would eat by themselves. He would see them through the safari on a very formal basis—what was it the French called it? Distinguished consideration—and it would be a damn sight easier than having to go through this emotional trash. He'd insult him and make a good clean break. Then he could read a book with his meals and he'd still be drinking their whisky. That was the phrase for it when a safari went bad. You ran into another white hunter and you asked,“How is everything going?”and he answered,“Oh, I'm still drinking their whisky,”and you knew everything had gone to pot.

“I'm sorry,”Macomber said and looked at him with his American face that would stay adolescent until it became middle-aged, and Wilson noted his crew-cropped hair, fine eyes only faintly shifty, good nose, thin lips and handsome jaw.“I'm sorry I didn't realize that. There are lots of things I don't know.”

So what could he do, Wilson thought. He was all ready to break it off quickly and neatly and here the beggar was apologizing after he had just insulted him. He made one more attempt.“Don't worry about me talking,”he said.“I have a living to make. You know in Africa no woman ever misses her lion and no white man ever bolts.”

“I bolted like a rabbit,”Macomber said.

Now what in hell were you going to do about a man who talked like that, Wilson wondered.

Wilson looked at Macomber with his flat, blue, machine-gunner's eyes and the other smiled back at him. He had a pleasant smile if you did not notice how his eyes showed when he was hurt.

“Maybe I can fix it up on buffalo,”he said.“We're after them next, aren't we?”

“In the morning if you like,”Wilson told him. Perhaps he had been wrong. This was certainly the way to take it. You most certainly could not tell a damned thing about an American. He was all for Macomber again. If you could forget the morning. But, of course, you couldn't. The morning had been about as bad as they come.

“Here comes the Memsahib,”he said. She was walking over from her tent looking refreshed and cheerful and quite lovely. She had a very perfect oval face, so perfect that you expected her to be stupid. But she wasn't stupid, Wilson thought, no, not stupid.

“How is the beautiful red-faced Mr. Wilson? Are you feeling better, Francis, my pearl?”

“Oh, much,”said Macomber.

“I've dropped the whole thing,”she said, sitting down at the table.“What importance is there to whether Francis is any good at killing lions? That's not his trade. That's Mr. Wilson's trade. Mr. Wilson is really very impressive killing anything. You do kill anything, don't you?”

“Oh, anything,”said Wilson.“Simply anything.”They are, he thought, the hardest in the world; the hardest, the cruelest, the most predatory and the most attractive and their men have softened or gone to pieces nervously as they have hardened. Or is it that they pick men they can handle? They can't know that much at the age they marry, he thought. He was grateful that he had gone through his education on American women before now because this was a very attractive one.

“We're going after buff in the morning,”he told her.

“I'm coming,”she said.

“No, you're not.”

“Oh, yes, I am. Mayn't I, Francis?”

“Why not stay in camp?”

“Not for anything,”she said.“I wouldn't miss something like today for anything.”

When she left, Wilson was thinking, when she went off to cry, she seemed a hell of a fine woman. She seemed to understand, to realize, to be hurt for him and for herself and to know how things really stood. She is away for twenty minutes and now she is back, simply enamelled in that American female cruelty. They are the damnedest women. Really the damnedest.

“We'll put on another show for you tomorrow,”Francis Macomber said.

“You're not coming,”Wilson said.

“You're very mistaken,”she told him.“And I want so to see you perform again. You were lovely this morning. That is if blowing things' heads off is lovely.”

“Here's the lunch,”said Wilson.“You're very merry, aren't you?”

“Why not? I didn't come out here to be dull.”

“Well, it hasn't been dull,”Wilson said. He could see the boulders in the river and the high bank beyond with the trees and he remembered the morning.

“Oh, no,”she said.“It's been charming. And tomorrow. You don't know how I look forward to tomorrow.”

“That's eland he's offering you,”Wilson said.

“They're the big cowy things that jump like hares, aren't they?”

“I suppose that describes them,”Wilson said.

“It's very good meat,”Macomber said.

“Did you shoot it, Francis?”she asked.

“Yes.”

“They're not dangerous, are they?”

“Only if they fall on you,”Wilson told her.

“I'm so glad.”

“Why not let up on the bitchery just a little, Margot,”Macomber said, cutting the eland steak and putting some mashed potato, gravy and carrot on the down-turned fork that tined through the piece of meat.

“I suppose I could,”she said,“since you put it so prettily.”

“Tonight we'll have champagne for the lion,”Wilson said.“It's a bit too hot at noon.”

“Oh, the lion,”Margot said.“I'd forgotten the lion!”

So, Robert Wilson thought to himself, she is giving him a ride, isn't she? Or do you suppose that's her idea of putting up a good show? How should a woman act when she discovers her husband is a bloody coward? She's damn cruel but they're all cruel. They govern, of course, and to govern one has to be cruel sometimes. Still, I've seen enough of their damn terrorism.

“Have some more eland,”he said to her politely.

That afternoon, late, Wilson and Macomber went out in the motor car with the native driver and the two gun-bearers. Mrs. Macomber stayed in the camp. It was too hot to go out, she said, and she was going with them in the early morning. As they drove off Wilson saw her standing under the big tree, looking pretty rather than beautiful in her faintly rosy khaki, her dark hair drawn back off her forehead and gathered in a knot low on her neck, her face as fresh, he thought, as though she were in England. She waved to them as the car went off through the swale of high grass and curved around through the trees into the small hills of orchard bush.

In the orchard bush they found a herd of impala, and leaving the car they stalked one old ram with long, wide-spread horns and Macomber killed it with a very creditable shot that knocked the buck down at a good two hundred yards and sent the herd off bounding wildly and leaping over one another's backs in long, leg-drawn-up leaps as unbelievable and as floating as those one makes sometimes in dreams.

“That was a good shot,”Wilson said.“They're a small target.”

“Is it a worth-while head?”Macomber asked.

“It's excellent,”Wilson told him.“You shoot like that and you'll have no trouble.”

“Do you think we'll find buffalo tomorrow?”

“There's a good chance of it. They feed out early in the morning and with luck we may catch them in the open.”

“I'd like to clear away that lion business,”Macomber said.“It's not very pleasant to have your wife see you do something like that.”

I should think it would be even more unpleasant to do it, Wilson thought, wife or no wife, or to talk about it having done it. But he said,“I wouldn't think about that any more. Any one could be upset by his first lion. That's all over.”

But that night after dinner and a whisky and soda by the fire before going to bed, as Francis Macomber lay on his cot with the mosquito bar over him and listened to the night noises it was not all over. It was neither all over nor was it beginning. It was there exactly as it happened with some parts of it indelibly emphasized and he was miserably ashamed at it. But more than shame he felt cold, hollow fear in him. The fear was still there like a cold slimy hollow in all the emptiness where once his confidence had been and it made him feel sick. It was still there with him now.

It had started the night before when he had wakened and heard the lion roaring somewhere up along the river. It was a deep sound and at the end there were sort of coughing grunts that made him seem just outside the tent, and when Francis Macomber woke in the night to hear it he was afraid. He could hear his wife breathing quietly, asleep. There was no one to tell he was afraid, nor to be afraid with him, and, lying alone, he did not know the Somali proverb that says a brave man is always frightened three times by a lion; when he first sees his track, when he first hears him roar and when he first confronts him. Then while they were eating breakfast by lantern light out in the dining tent, before the sun was up, the lion roared again and Francis thought he was just at the edge of camp.

“Sounds like an old-timer,”Robert Wilson said, looking up from his kippers and coffee.“Listen to him cough.”

“Is he very close?”

“A mile or so up the stream.”

“Will we see him?”

“We'll have a look.”

“Does his roaring carry that far? It sounds as though he were right in camp.”

“Carries a hell of a long way,”said Robert Wilson.“It's strange the way it carries. Hope he's a shootable cat. The boys said there was a very big one about here.”

“If I get a shot, where should I hit him,”Macomber asked,“to stop him?”

“In the shoulders,”Wilson said.“In the neck if you can make it. Shoot for bone. Break him down.”

“I hope I can place it properly,”Macomber said.

“You shoot very well,”Wilson told him.“Take your time. Make sure of him. The first one in is the one that counts.”

“What range will it be?”

“Can't tell. Lion has something to say about that. Don't shoot unless it's close enough so you can make sure.”

“At under a hundred yards?”Macomber asked.

Wilson looked at him quickly.

“Hundred's about right. Might have to take him a bit under. Shouldn't chance a shot at much over that. A hundred's a decent range. You can hit him wherever you want at that. Here comes the Memsahib.”

“Good morning,”she said.“Are we going after that lion?”

“As soon as you deal with your breakfast,”Wilson said.“How are you feeling?”

“Marvellous,”she said.“I'm very excited.”

“I'll just go and see that everything is ready.”Wilson went off. As he left the lion roared again.

“Noisy beggar,”Wilson said.“We'll put a stop to that.”

“What's the matter, Francis?”his wife asked him.

“Nothing,”Macomber said.

“Yes, there is,”she said.“What are you upset about?”

“Nothing,”he said.

“Tell me,”she looked at him.“Don't you feel well?”

“It's that damned roaring,”he said.“It's been going on all night, you know.”

“Why didn't you wake me,”she said.“I'd love to have heard it.”

“I've got to kill the damned thing,”Macomber said, miserably.

“Well, that's what you're out here for, isn't it?”

“Yes. But I'm nervous. Hearing the thing roar gets on my nerves.”

“Well then, as Wilson said, kill him and stop his roaring.”

“Yes, darling,”said Francis Macomber.“It sounds easy, doesn't it?”

“You're not afraid, are you?”

“Of course not. But I'm nervous from hearing him roar all night.”

“You'll kill him marvellously,”she said.“I know you will. I'm awfully anxious to see it.”

“Finish your breakfast and we'll be starting.”

“It's not light yet,”she said.“This is a ridiculous hour.”

Just then the lion roared in a deep-chested moaning, suddenly guttural, ascending vibration that seemed to shake the air and ended in a sigh and a heavy, deep-chested grunt.

“He sounds almost here,”Macomber's wife said.

“My God,”said Macomber.“I hate that damned noise.”

“It's very impressive.”

“Impressive. It's frightful.”

Robert Wilson came up then carrying his short, ugly, shockingly big-bored .505 Gibbs and grinning.

“Come on,”he said.“Your gun-bearer has your Springfield and the big gun. Everything's in the car. Have you solids?”

“Yes.”

“I'm ready,”Mrs. Macomber said.

“Must make him stop that racket,”Wilson said.“You get in front. The Memsahib can sit back here with me.”

They climbed into the motor car and, in the gray first daylight, moved off up the river through the trees. Macomber opened the breech of his rifle and saw he had metal-cased bullets, shut the bolt and put the rifle on safety. He saw his hand was trembling. He felt in his pocket for more cartridges and moved his fingers over the cartridges in the loops of his tunic front. He turned back to where Wilson sat in the rear seat of the doorless, box-bodied motor car beside his wife, them both grinning with excitement, and Wilson leaned forward and whispered,

“See the birds dropping. Means the old boy has left his kill.”

On the far bank of the stream Macomber could see, above the trees, vultures circling and plummeting down.

“Chances are he'll come to drink along here,”Wilson whispered.“Before he goes to lay up. Keep an eye out.”

They were driving slowly along the high bank of the stream which here cut deeply to its boulder-filled bed, and they wound in and out through big trees as they drove. Macomber was watching the opposite bank when he felt Wilson take hold of his arm. The car stopped.

“There he is,”he heard the whisper.“Ahead and to the right. Get out and take him. He's a marvellous lion.”

Macomber saw the lion now. He was standing almost broadside, his great head up and turned toward them. The early morning breeze that blew toward them was just stirring his dark mane, and the lion looked huge, silhouetted on the rise of bank in the gray morning light, his shoulders heavy, his barrel of a body bulking smoothly.

“How far is he?”asked Macomber, raising his rifle.

“About seventy-five. Get out and take him.”

“Why not shoot from where I am?”

“You don't shoot them from cars,”he heard Wilson saying in his ear.“Get out. He's not going to stay there all day.”

Macomber stepped out of the curved opening at the side of the front seat, onto the step and down onto the ground. The lion still stood looking majestically and coolly toward this object that his eyes only showed in silhouette, bulking like some super-rhino. There was no man smell carried toward him and he watched the object, moving his great head a little from side to side. Then watching the object, not afraid, but hesitating before going down the bank to drink with such a thing opposite him, he saw a man figure detach itself from it and he turned his heavy head and swung away toward the cover of the trees as he heard a cracking crash and felt the slam of a .30-06 220-grain solid bullet that bit his flank and ripped in sudden hot scalding nausea through his stomach. He trotted, heavy, bigfooted, swinging wounded full-bellied, through the trees toward the tall grass and cover, and the crash came again to go past him ripping the air apart. Then it crashed again and he felt the blow as it hit his lower ribs and ripped on through, blood sudden hot and frothy in his mouth, and he galloped toward the high grass where he could crouch and not be seen and make them bring the crashing thing close enough so he could make a rush and get the man that held it.

Macomber had not thought how the lion felt as he got out of the car. He only knew his hands were shaking and as he walked away from the car it was almost impossible for him to make his legs move. They were stiff in the thighs, but he could feel the muscles fluttering. He raised the rifle, sighted on the junction of the lion's head and shoulders and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened though he pulled until he thought his finger would break. Then he knew he had the safety on and as he lowered the rifle to move the safety over he moved another frozen pace forward, and the lion seeing his silhouette flow clear of the silhouette of the car, turned and started off at a trot, and, as Macomber fired, he heard a whunk that meant that the bullet was home; but the lion kept on going. Macomber shot again and every one saw the bullet throw a spout of dirt beyond the trotting lion. He shot again, remembering to lower his aim, and they all heard the bullet hit, and the lion went into a gallop and was in the tall grass before he had the bolt pushed forward.

Macomber stood there feeling sick at his stomach, his hands that held the Springfield still cocked, shaking, and his wife and Robert Wilson were standing by him. Beside him too were the two gun-bearers chattering in Wakamba.

“I hit him,”Macomber said.“I hit him twice.”

“You gut-shot him and you hit him somewhere forward,”Wilson said without enthusiasm. The gun-bearers looked very grave. They were silent now.

“You may have killed him,”Wilson went on.“We'll have to wait a while before we go in to find out”

“What do you mean?”

“Let him get sick before we follow him up.”

“Oh,”said Macomber.

“He's a hell of a fine lion,”Wilson said cheerfully.“He's gotten into a bad place though.”

“Why is it bad?”

“Can't see him until you're on him.”

“Oh,”said Macomber.

“Come on,”said Wilson.“The Memsahib can stay here in the car. We'll go to have a look at the blood spoor.”

“Stay here, Margot,”Macomber said to his wife. His mouth was very dry and it was hard for him to talk.

“Why?”she asked.

“Wilson says to.”

“We're going to have a look,”Wilson said.“You stay here. You can see even better from here.”

“All right.”

Wilson spoke in Swahili to the driver. He nodded and said,“Yes, Bwana.”

Then they went down the steep bank and across the stream, climbing over and around the boulders and up the other bank, pulling up by some projecting roots, and along it until they found where the lion had been trotting when Macomber first shot. There was dark blood on the short grass that the gun-bearers pointed out with grass stems, and that ran away behind the river bank trees.

“What do we do?”asked Macomber.

“Not much choice,”said Wilson.“We can't bring the car over. Bank's too steep. We'll let him stiffen up a bit and then you and I'll go in and have a look for him.”

“Can't we set the grass on fire?”Macomber asked.

“Too green.”

“Can't we send beaters?”

Wilson looked at him appraisingly.“Of course we can,”he said.“But it's just a touch murderous. You see, we know the lion's wounded. You can drive an unwounded lion—he'll move on ahead of a noise—but a wounded lion's going to charge. You can't see him until you're right on him. He'll make himself perfectly flat in cover you wouldn't think would hide a hare. You can't very well send boys in there to that sort of a show. Somebody bound to get mauled.”

“What about the gun-bearers?”

“Oh, they'll go with us. It's their shauri. You see, they signed on for it. They don't look too happy though, do they?”

“I don't want to go in there,”said Macomber. It was out before he knew he'd said it.

“Neither do I,”said Wilson very cheerily.“Really no choice though.”Then, as an afterthought, he glanced at Macomber and saw suddenly how he was trembling and the pitiful look on his face.

“You don't have to go in, of course,”he said.“That's what I'm hired for, you know. That's why I'm so expensive.”

“You mean you'd go in by yourself? Why not leave him there?”

Robert Wilson, whose entire occupation had been with the lion and the problem he presented, and who had not been thinking about Macomber except to note that he was rather windy, suddenly felt as though he had opened the wrong door in a hotel and seen something shameful.

“What do you mean?”

“Why not just leave him?”

“You mean pretend to ourselves he hasn't been hit?”

“No. Just drop it.”

“It isn't done.”

“Why not?”

“For one thing, he's certain to be suffering. For another, some one else might run onto him.”

“I see.”

“But you don't have to have anything to do with it.”

“I'd like to,”Macomber said.“I'm just scared, you know.”

“I'll go ahead when we go in,”Wilson said,“with Kongoni tracking. You keep behind me and a little to one side. Chances are we'll hear him growl. If we see him we'll both shoot. Don't worry about anything. I'll keep you backed up. As a matter of fact, you know, perhaps you'd better not go. It might be much better. Why don't you go over and join the Memsahib while I just get it over with?”

“No, I want to go.”

“All right,”said Wilson.“But don't go in if you don't want to. This is my shauri now, you know.”

“I want to go,”said Macomber.

They sat under a tree and smoked.

“Want to go back and speak to the Memsahib while we're waiting?”Wilson asked.

“No.”

“I'll just step back and tell her to be patient.”

“Good,”said Macomber. He sat there, sweating under his arms, his mouth dry, his stomach hollow feeling, wanting to find courage to tell Wilson to go on and finish off the lion without him. He could not know that Wilson was furious because he had not noticed the state he was in earlier and sent him back to his wife. While he sat there Wilson came up.“I have your big gun,”he said.“Take it. We've given him time, I think. Come on.”

Macomber took the big gun and Wilson said:

“Keep behind me and about five yards to the right and do exactly as I tell you.”Then he spoke in Swahili to the two gun-bearers who looked the picture of gloom.

“Let's go,”he said.

“Could I have a drink of water?”Macomber asked. Wilson spoke to the older gun-bearer, who wore a canteen on his belt, and the man unbuckled it, unscrewed the top and handed it to Macomber, who took it noticing how heavy it seemed and how hairy and shoddy the felt covering was in his hand. He raised it to drink and looked ahead at the high grass with the flat-topped trees behind it. A breeze was blowing toward them and the grass rippled gently in the wind. He looked at the gun-bearer and he could see the gun-bearer was suffering too with fear.

Thirty-five yards into the grass the big lion lay flattened out along the ground. His ears were back and his only movement was a slight twitching up and down of his long, black-tufted tail. He had turned at bay as soon as he had reached this cover and he was sick with the wound through his full belly, and weakening with the wound through his lungs that brought a thin foamy red to his mouth each time he breathed. His flanks were wet and hot and flies were on the little openings the solid bullets had made in his tawny hide, and his big yellow eyes, narrowed with hate, looked straight ahead, only blinking when the pain came as he breathed, and his claws dug in the soft baked earth. All of him, pain, sickness, hatred and all of his remaining strength, was tightening into an absolute concentration for a rush. He could hear the men talking and he waited, gathering all of himself into this preparation for a charge as soon as the men would come into the grass. As he heard their voices his tail stiffened to twitch up and down, and, as they came into the edge of the grass, he made a coughing grunt and charged.

Kongoni, the old gun-bearer, in the lead watching the blood spoor, Wilson watching the grass for any movement, his big gun ready, the second gun-bearer looking ahead and listening, Macomber close to Wilson, his rifle cocked, they had just moved into the grass when Macomber heard the blood-choked coughing grunt, and saw the swishing rush in the grass. The next thing he knew he was running; running wildly, in panic in the open, running toward the stream.

He heard the ca-ra-wong! of Wilson's big rifle, and again in a second crashing carawong! and turning saw the lion, horrible-looking now, with half his head seeming to be gone, crawling toward Wilson in the edge of the tall grass while the red-faced man worked the bolt on the short ugly rifle and aimed carefully as another blasting carawong! came from the muzzle, and the crawling, heavy, yellow bulk of the lion stiffened and the huge, mutilated head slid forward and Macomber, standing by himself in the clearing where he had run, holding a loaded rifle, while two black men and a white man looked back at him in contempt, knew the lion was dead. He came toward Wilson, his tallness all seeming a naked reproach, and Wilson looked at him and said:

“Want to take pictures?”

“No,”he said.

That was all any one had said until they reached the motor car. Then Wilson had said:

“Hell of a fine lion. Boys will skin him out. We might as well stay here in the shade.”

Macomber's wife had not looked at him nor he at her and he had sat by her in the back seat with Wilson sitting in the front seat. Once he had reached over and taken his wife's hand without looking at her and she had removed her hand from his. Looking across the stream to where the gun-bearers were skinning out the lion he could see that she had been able to see the whole thing. While they sat there his wife had reached forward and put her hand on Wilson's shoulder. He turned and she had leaned forward over the low seat and kissed him on the mouth.

“Oh, I say,”said Wilson, going redder than his natural baked color.

“Mr. Robert Wilson,”she said.“The beautiful red-faced Mr. Robert Wilson.”

Then she sat down beside Macomber again and looked away across the stream to where the lion lay, with uplifted, white-muscled, tendon-marked naked forearms, and white bloating belly, as the black men fleshed away the skin. Finally the gun-bearers brought the skin over, wet and heavy, and climbed in behind with it, rolling it up before they got in, and the motor car started. No one had said anything more until they were back in camp.

That was the story of the lion. Macomber did not know how the lion had felt before he started his rush, nor during it when the unbelievable smash of the .505 with a muzzle velocity of two tons had hit him in the mouth, nor what kept him coming after that, when the second ripping crash had smashed his hind quarters and he had come crawling on toward the crashing, blasting thing that had destroyed him. Wilson knew something about it and only expressed it by saying,“Damned fine lion,”but Macomber did not know how Wilson felt about things either. He did not know how his wife felt except that she was through with him.

His wife had been through with him before but it never lasted. He was very wealthy, and would be much wealthier, and he knew she would not leave him ever now. That was one of the few things that he really knew. He knew about that, about motor cycles—that was earliest—about motor cars, about duck-shooting, about fishing, trout, salmon and big-sea, about sex in books, many books, too many books, about all court games, about dogs, not much about horses, about hanging on to his money, about most of the other things his world dealt in, and about his wife not leaving him. His wife had been a great beauty and she was still a great beauty in Africa, but she was not a great enough beauty any more at home to be able to leave him and better herself and she knew it and he knew it. She had missed the chance to leave him and he knew it. If he had been better with women she would probably have started to worry about him getting another new, beautiful wife; but she knew too much about him to worry about him either. Also, he had always had a great tolerance which seemed the nicest thing about him if it were not the most sinister.

All in all they were known as a comparatively happily married couple, one of those whose disruption is often rumored but never occurs, and as the society columnist put it, they were adding more than a spice of adventure to their much envied and ever-enduring Romance by a Safari in what was known as Darkest Africa until the Martin Johnsons lighted it on so many silver screens where they were pursuing Old Simba the lion, the buffalo, Tembo the elephant and as well collecting specimens for the Museum of Natural History. This same columnist had reported them on the verge at least three times in the past and they had been. But they always made it up. They had a sound basis of union. Margot was too beautiful for Macomber to divorce her and Macomber had too much money for Margot ever to leave him.

It was now about three o'clock in the morning and Francis Macomber, who had been asleep a little while after he had stopped thinking about the lion, wakened and then slept again, woke suddenly, frightened in a dream of the bloody-headed lion standing over him, and listening while his heart pounded, he realized that his wife was not in the other cot in the tent. He lay awake with that knowledge for two hours.

At the end of that time his wife came into the tent, lifted her mosquito bar and crawled cozily into bed.

“Where have you been?”Macomber asked in the darkness.

“Hello,”she said.“Are you awake?”

“Where have you been?”

“I just went out to get a breath of air.”

“You did, like hell.”

“What do you want me to say, darling?”

“Where have you been?”

“Out to get a breath of air.”

“That's a new name for it. You are a bitch.”

“Well, you're a coward.”

“All right,”he said.“What of it?”

“Nothing as far as I'm concerned. But please let's not talk, darling, because I'm very sleepy.”

“You think that I'll take anything.”

“I know you will, sweet.”

“Well, I won't.”

“Please, darling, let's not talk. I'm so very sleepy.”

“There wasn't going to be any of that. You promised there wouldn't be.”

“Well, there is now,”she said sweetly.

“You said if we made this trip that there would be none of that. You promised.”

“Yes, darling. That's the way I meant it to be. But the trip was spoiled yesterday. We don't have to talk about it, do we?”

“You don't wait long when you have an advantage, do you?”

“Please let's not talk. I'm so sleepy, darling.”

“I'm going to talk.”

“Don't mind me then, because I'm going to sleep.”And she did.

At breakfast they were all three at the table before daylight and Francis Macomber found that, of all the many men that he had hated, he hated Robert Wilson the most.

“Sleep well?”Wilson asked in his throaty voice, filling a pipe.

“Did you?”

“Topping,”the white hunter told him.

You bastard, thought MaComber, you insolent bastard.

So she woke him when she came in, Wilson thought, looking at them both with his flat, cold eyes. Well, why doesn't he keep his wife where she belongs? What does he think I am, a bloody plaster saint? Let him keep her where she belongs. It's his own fault.

“Do you think we'll find buffalo?”Margot asked, pushing away a dish of apricots.

“Chance of it,”Wilson said and smiled at her.“Why don't you stay in camp?”

“Not for anything,”she told him.

“Why not order her to stay in camp?”Wilson said to Macomber.

“You order her,”said Macomber coldly.

“Let's not have any ordering, nor,”turning to Macomber,“any silliness, Francis,”Margot said quite pleasantly.

“Are you ready to start?”Macomber asked.

“Any time,”Wilson told him.“Do you want the Memsahib to go?”

“Does it make any difference whether I do or not?”

The hell with it, thought Robert Wilson. The utter complete hell with it. So this is what it's going to be like. Well, this is what it's going to be like, then.

“Makes no difference,”he said.

“You're sure you wouldn't like to stay in camp with her yourself and let me go out and hunt the buffalo?”Macomber asked.

“Can't do that,”said Wilson.“Wouldn't talk rot if I were you.”

“I'm not talking rot. I'm disgusted.”

“Bad word, disgusted.”

“Francis, will you please try to speak sensibly,”his wife said.

“I speak too damned sensibly,”Macomber said.“Did you ever eat such filthy food?”

“Something wrong with the food?”asked Wilson quietly.

“No more than with everything else.”

“I'd pull yourself together, laddybuck,”Wilson said very quietly.“There's a boy waits at table that understands a little English.”

“The hell with him.”

Wilson stood up and puffing on his pipe strolled away, speaking a few words in Swahili to one of the gun-bearers who was standing waiting for him. Macomber and his wife sat on at the table. He was staring at his coffee cup.

“If you make a scene I'll leave you, darling,”Margot said quietly.

“No, you won't.”

“You can try it and see.”

“You won't leave me.”

“No,”she said.“I won't leave you and you'll behave your self.”

“Behave myself? That's a way to talk. Behave myself.”

“Yes. Behave yourself.”

“Why don't you try behaving?”

“I've tried it so long. So very long.”

“I hate that red-faced swine,”Macomber said.“I loathe the sight of him.”

“He's really very nice.”

“Oh, shut up,”Macomber almost shouted. Just then the car came up and stopped in front of the dining tent and the driver and the two gunbearers got out. Wilson walked over and looked at the husband and wife sitting there at the table.

“Going shooting?”he asked.

“Yes,”said Macomber, standing up.“Yes.”

“Better bring a woolly. It will be cool in the car,”Wilson said.

“I'll get my leather jacket,”Margot said.

“The boy has it,”Wilson told her. He climbed into the front with the driver and Francis Macomber and his wife sat, not speaking, in the back seat.

Hope the silly beggar doesn't take a notion to blow the back of my head off, Wilson thought to himself. Women are a nuisance on safari.

The car was grinding down to cross the river at a pebbly ford in the gray daylight and then climbed, angling up the steep bank, where Wilson had ordered a way shovelled out the day before so they could reach the parklike wooded rolling country on the far side.

It was a good morning, Wilson thought. There was a heavy dew and as the wheels went through the grass and low bushes he could smell the odor of the crushed fronds. It was an odor like verbena and he liked this early morning smell of the dew, the crushed bracken and the look of the tree trunks showing black through the early morning mist, as the car made its way through the untracked, parklike country. He had put the two in the back seat out of his mind now and was thinking about buffalo. The buffalo that he was after stayed in the daytime in a thick swamp where it was impossible to get a shot, but in the night they fed out into an open stretch of country and if he could come between them and their swamp with the car, Macomber would have a good chance at them in the open. He did not want to hunt buff with Macomber in thick cover. He did not want to hunt buff or anything else with Macomber at all, but he was a professional hunter and he had hunted with some rare ones in his time. If they got buff today there would only be rhino to come and the poor man would have gone through his dangerous game and things might pick up. He'd have nothing more to do with the woman and Macomber would get over that too. He must have gone through plenty of that before by the look of things. Poor beggar. He must have a way of getting over it. Well, it was the poor sod's own bloody fault.

He, Robert Wilson, carried a double size cot on safari to accommodate any windfalls he might receive. He had hunted for a certain clientele, the international, fast, sporting set, where the women did not feel they were getting their money's worth unless they had shared that cot with the white hunter. He despised them when he was away from them although he liked some of them well enough at the time, but he made his living by them; and their standards were his standards as long as they were hiring him.

They were his standards in all except the shooting. He had his own standards about the killing and they could live up to them or get some one else to hunt them. He knew, too, that they all respected him for this. This Macomber was an odd one though. Damned if he wasn't. Now the wife. Well, the wife. Yes, the wife. Hm, the wife. Well he'd dropped all that. He looked around at them. Macomber sat grim and furious. Margot smiled at him. She looked younger today, more innocent and fresher and not so professionally beautiful. What's in her heart God knows, Wilson thought. She hadn't talked much last night. At that it was a pleasure to see her.

The motor car climbed up a slight rise and went on through the trees and then out into a grassy prairie-like opening and kept in the shelter of the trees along the edge, the driver going slowly and Wilson looking carefully out across the prairie and all along its far side. He stopped the car and studied the opening with his field glasses. Then he motioned to the driver to go on and the car moved slowly along, the driver avoiding warthog holes and driving around the mud castles ants had built. Then, looking across the opening, Wilson suddenly turned and said,

“By God, there they are!”

And looking where he pointed, while the car jumped forward and Wilson spoke in rapid Swahili to the driver, Macomber saw three huge, black animals looking almost cylindrical in their long heaviness, like big black tank cars, moving at a gallop across the far edge of the open prairie. They moved at a stiff-necked, stiff bodied gallop and he could see the upswept wide black horns on their heads as they galloped heads out; the heads not moving.

“They're three old bulls,”Wilson said.“We'll cut them off before they get to the swamp.”

The car was going a wild forty-five miles an hour across the open and as Macomber watched, the buffalo got bigger and bigger until he could see the gray, hairless, scabby look of one huge bull and how his neck was a part of his shoulders and the shiny black of his horns as he galloped a little behind the others that were strung out in that steady plunging gait; and then, the car swaying as though it had just jumped a road, they drew up close and he could see the plunging hugeness of the bull, and the dust in his sparsely haired hide, the wide boss of horn and his outstretched, wide-nostrilled muzzle, and he was raising his rifle when Wilson shouted,“Not from the car, you fool!”and he had no fear, only hatred of Wilson, while the brakes clamped on and the car skidded, plowing sideways to an almost stop and Wilson was out on one side and he on the other, stumbling as his feet hit the still speeding-by of the earth, and then he was shooting at the bull as he moved away, hearing the bullets whunk into him, emptying his rifle at him as he moved steadily away, finally remembering to get his shots forward into the shoulder, and as he fumbled to re-load, he saw the bull was down. Down on his knees, his big head tossing, and seeing the other two still galloping he shot at the leader and hit him. He shot again and missed and he heard the carawonging roar as Wilson shot and saw the leading bull slide forward onto his nose.

“Get that other,”Wilson said.“Now you're shooting!”

But the other bull was moving steadily at the same gallop and he missed, throwing a spout of dirt, and Wilson missed and the dust rose in a cloud and Wilson shouted,“Come on. He's too far!”and grabbed his arm and they were in the car again, Macomber and Wilson hanging on the sides and rocketing swayingly over the uneven ground, drawing up on the steady, plunging, heavy-necked, straight-moving gallop of the bull.

They were behind him and Macomber was filling his rifle, dropping shells onto the ground, jamming it, clearing the jam, then they were almost up with the bull when Wilson yelled“Stop,”and the car skidded so that it almost swung over and Macomber fell forward onto his feet, slammed his bolt forward and fired as far forward as he could aim into the galloping, rounded black back, aimed and shot again, then again, then again, and the bullets, all of them hitting, had no effect on the buffalo that he could see. Then Wilson shot, the roar deafening him, and he could see the bull stagger. Macomber shot again, aiming carefully, and down he came, onto his knees.

“All right,”Wilson said.“Nice work. That's the three.”

Macomber felt a drunken elation.

“How many times did you shoot?”he asked.

“Just three,”Wilson said.“You killed the first bull. The biggest one. I helped you finish the other two. Afraid they might have got into cover.

You had them killed. I was just mopping up a little. You shot damn well.”

“Let's go to the car,”said Macomber.“I want a drink.”

“Got to finish off that buff first,”Wilson told him. The buffalo was on his knees and he jerked his head furiously and bellowed in pig-eyed, roaring rage as they came toward him.

“Watch he doesn't get up,”Wilson said. Then,“Get a little broadside and take him in the neck just behind the ear.”

Macomber aimed carefully at the center of the huge, jerking, rage-driven neck and shot. At the shot the head dropped forward.

“That does it,”said Wilson.“Got the spine. They're a hell of a looking thing, aren't they?”

“Let's get the drink,”said Macomber. In his life he had never felt so good.

In the car Macomber's wife sat very white-faced.“You were marvellous, darling,”she said to Macomber.“What a ride.”

“Was it rough?”Wilson asked.

“It was frightful. I've never been more frightened in my life.”

“Let's all have a drink,”Macomber said.

“By all means,”said Wilson.“Give it to the Memsahib.”She drank the neat whisky from the flask and shuddered a little when she swallowed. She handed the flask to Macomber who handed it to Wilson.

“It was frightfully exciting,”she said.“It's given me a dreadful headache. I didn't know you were allowed to shoot them from cars though.

“No one shot from cars,”said Wilson coldly.

“I mean chase them from cars.”

“Wouldn't ordinarily,”Wilson said.“Seemed sporting enough to me though while we were doing it. Taking more chance driving that way across the plain full of holes and one thing and another than hunting on foot. Buffalo could have charged us each time we shot if he liked. Gave him every chance. Wouldn't mention it to any one though. It's illegal if that's what you mean.”

“It seemed very unfair to me,”Margot said,“chasing those big helpless things in a motor car.”

“Did it?”said Wilson.

“What would happen if they heard about it in Nairobi?”

“I'd lose my licence for one thing. Other unpleasantnesses,”Wilson said, taking a drink from the flask.“I'd be out of business.”

“Really?”

“Yes, really.”

“Well,”said Macomber, and he smiled for the first time all day.“Now she has something on you.”

“You have such a pretty way of putting things, Francis,”Margot Macomber said. Wilson looked at them both. If a four-letter man marries a five-letter woman, he was thinking, what number of letters would their children be? What he said was,“We lost a gun-bearer. Did you notice it?”

“My God, no,”Macomber said.

“Here he comes,”Wilson said.“He's all right. He must have fallen off when we left the first bull.”

Approaching them was the middle-aged gun-bearer, limping along in his knitted cap, khaki tunic, shorts and rubber sandals, gloomy-faced and disgusted looking. As he came up he called out to Wilson in Swahili and they all saw the change in the white hunter's face.

“What does he say?”asked Margot.

“He says the first bull got up and went into the bush,”Wilson said with no expression in his voice.

“Oh,”said Macomber blankly.

“Then it's going to be just like the lion,”said Margot, rull of anticipation.

“It's not going to be a damned bit like the lion,”Wilson told her.“Did you want another drink, Macomber?”

“Thanks, yes,”Macomber said. He expected the feeling he had had about the lion to come back but it did not. For the first time in his life he really felt wholly without fear. Instead of fear he had a feeling of definite elation.

“We'll go and have a look at the second bull,”Wilson said.“I'll tell the driver to put the car in the shade.”

“What are you going to do?”asked Margaret Macomber.

“Take a look at the buff,”Wilson said.

“I'll come.”

“Come along.”

The three of them walked over to where the second buffalo bulked blackly in the open, head forward on the grass, the massive horns swung wide.

“He's a very good head,”Wilson said.“That's dose to a fifty-inch spread.”

Macomber was looking at him with delight.

“He's hateful looking,”said Margot.“Can't we go into the shade?”

“Of course,”Wilson said.“Look,”he said to Macomber, and pointed.“See that patch of bush?”

“Yes.”

“That's where the first bull went in. The gun-bearer said when he fell off the bull was down. He was watching us helling along and the other two buff galloping. When he looked up there was the bull up and looking at him. Gun-bearer ran like hell and the bull went off slowly into that bush.”

“Can we go in after him now?”asked Macomber eagerly.

Wilson looked at him appraisingly. Damned if this isn't a strange one, he thought. Yesterday he's scared sick and today he's a ruddy fire eater.

“No, we'll give him a while.”

“Let's please go into the shade,”Margot said. Her face was white and she looked ill.

They made their way to the car where it stood under a single, wide-spreading tree and all climbed in.

“Chances are he's dead in there,”Wilson remarked.“After a little we'll have a look.”

Macomber felt a wild unreasonable happiness that he had never known before.

“By God, that, was a chase,”he said.“I've never felt any such feeling. Wasn't it marvellous, Margot?”

“I hated it.”

“Why?”

“I hated it,”she said bitterly.“I loathed it.”

“You know I don't think I'd ever be afraid of anything again,”Macomber said to Wilson.“Something happened in me after we first saw the buff and started after him. Like a dam bursting. It was pure excitement.”

“Cleans out your liver,”said Wilson.“Damn funny things happen to people.”

Macomber's face was shining.“You know something did happen to me,”he said.“I feel absolutely different.”

His wife said nothing and eyed him strangely. She was sitting far back in the seat and Macomber was sitting forward talking to Wilson who turned sideways talking over the back of the front seat.

“You know, I'd like to try another lion,”Macomber said.“I'm really not afraid of them now. After all, what can they do to you?”

“That's it,”said Wilson.“Worst one can do is kill you. How does it go? Shakespeare. Damned good. See if I can remember. Oh, damned good. Used to quote it to myself at one time. Let's see.‘By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God a death and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.’Damned fine, eh?”

He was very embarrassed, having brought out this thing he had lived by, but he had seen men come of age before and it always moved him. It was not a matter of their twenty-first birthday.

It had taken a strange chance of hunting, a sudden precipitation into action without opportunity for worrying beforehand, to bring this about with Macomber, but regardless of how it had happened it had most certainly happened. Look at the beggar now, Wilson thought. It's that some of them stay little boys so long, Wilson thought. Sometimes all their lives. Their figures stay boyish when they're fifty. The great American boy-men. Damned strange people. But he liked this Macomber now. Damned strange fellow. Probably meant the end of cuckoldry too. Well, that would be a damned good thing. Damned good thing. Beggar had probably been afraid all his life. Don't know what started it. But over now. Hadn't had time to be afraid with the buff. That and being angry too. Motor car too. Motor cars made it familiar. Be a damn fire eater now. He'd seen it in the war work the same way. More of a change than any loss of virginity. Fear gone like an operation. Something else grew in its place. Main thing a man had. Made him into a man. Women knew it too. No bloody fear.

From the far corner of the seat Margaret Macomber looked at the two of them. There was no change in Wilson. She saw Wilson as she had seen him the day before when she had first realized what his great talent was. But she saw the change in Francis Macomber now.

“Do you have that feeling of happiness about what's going to happen?”Macomber asked, still exploring his new wealth.

“You're not supposed to mention it,”Wilson said, looking in the other's face.“Much more fashionable to say you're scared. Mind you, you'll be scared too, plenty of times.”

“But you have a feeling of happiness about action to come?”

“Yes,”said Wilson.“There's that. Doesn't do to talk too much about all this. Talk the whole thing away. No pleasure in anything if you mouth it up too much.”

“You're both talking rot,”said Margot.“Just because you've chased some helpless animals in a motor car you talk like heroes.”

“Sorry,”said Wilson.“I have been gassing too much.”She's worried about it already, he thought.

“If you don't know what we're talking about why not keep out of it?”Macomber asked his wife.

“You've gotten awfully brave, awfully suddenly,”his wife said contemptuously, but her contempt was not secure. She was very afraid of something.

Macomber laughed, a very natural hearty laugh.“You know I have,”he said.“I really have.”

“Isn't it sort of late?”Margot said bitterly. Because she had done the best she could for many years back and the way they were together now was no one person's fault.

“Not for me,”said Macomber.

Margot said nothing but sat back in the corner of the seat.

“Do you think we've given him time enough?”Macomber asked Wilson cheerfully.

“We might have a look,”Wilson said.“Have you any solids left?”

“The gun-bearer has some.”

Wilson called in Swahili and the older gun-bearer, who was skinning out one of the heads, straightened up, pulled a box of solids out of his pocket and brought them over to Macomber, who filled his magazine and put the remaining shells in his pocket.

“You might as well shoot the Springfield,”Wilson said.“You're used to it. We'll leave the Mannlicher in the car with the Memsahib. Your gun-bearer can carry your heavy gun. I've this damned cannon. Now let me tell you about them.”He had saved this until the last because he did not want to worry Macomber.“When a buff comes he comes with his head high and thrust straight out. The boss of the horns covers any sort of a brain shot. The only shot is straight into the nose. The only other shot is into his chest or, if you're to one side, into the neck or the shoulders. After they've been hit once they take a hell of a lot of killing. Don't try anything fancy. Take the easiest shot there is. They've finished skinning out that head now. Should we get started?”

He called to the gun-bearers, who came up wiping their hands, and the older one got into the back.

“I'll only take Kongoni,”Wilson said.“The other can watch to keep the birds away.”

As the car moved slowly across the open space toward the island of brushy trees that ran in a tongue of foliage along a dry water course that cut the open swale, Macomber felt his heart pounding and his mouth was dry again, but it was excitement, not fear.

“Here's where he went in,”Wilson said. Then to the gun-bearer in Swahili,“Take the blood spoor.”

The car was parallel to the patch of bush. Macomber, Wilson and the gun-bearer got down. Macomber, looking back, saw his wife, with the rifle by her side, looking at him. He waved to her and she did not wave back.

The brush was very thick ahead and the ground was dry. The middle-aged gun-bearer was sweating heavily and Wilson had his hat down over his eyes and his red neck showed just ahead of Macomber. Suddenly the gun-bearer said something in Swahili to Wilson and ran forward.

“He's dead in there,”Wilson said.“Good work,”and he turned to grip Macomber's hand and as they shook hands, grinning at each other, the gun-bearer shouted wildly and they saw him coming out of the bush sideways, fast as a crab, and the bull coming, nose out, mouth tight closed, blood dripping, massive head straight out, coming in a charge, his little pig eyes bloodshot as he looked at them. Wilson, who was ahead, was kneeling shooting, and Macomber, as he fired, unhearing his shot in the roaring of Wilson's gun, saw fragments like slate burst from the huge boss of the horns, and the head jerked, he shot again at the wide nostrils and saw the horns jolt again and fragments fly, and he did not see Wilson now and, aiming carefully, shot again with the buffalo's huge bulk almost on him and his rifle almost level with the on-coming head, nose out, and he could see the little wicked eyes and the head started to lower and he felt a sudden white-hot, blinding flash explode inside his head and that was all he ever felt.

Wilson had ducked to one side to get in a shoulder shot. Macomber had stood solid and shot for the nose, shooting a touch high each time and hitting the heavy horns, splintering and chipping them like hitting a slate roof, and Mrs. Macomber, in the car, had shot at the buffalo with the 6.5 Mannlicher as it seemed about to gore Macomber and had hit her husband about two inches up and a little to one side of the base of his skull.

Francis Macomber lay now, face down, not two yards from where the buffalo lay on his side and his wife knelt over him with Wilson beside her.

“I wouldn't turn him over,”Wilson said.

The woman was crying hysterically.

“I'd get back in the car,”Wilson said.“Where's the rifle?”

She shook her head, her face contorted. The gun-bearer picked up the rifle.

“Leave it as it is,”said Wilson. Then,“Go get Abdulla so that he may witness the manner of the accident.”

He knelt down, took a handkerchief from his pocket, and spread it over Francis Macomber's crew-cropped head where it lay. The blood sank into the dry, loose earth.

Wilson stood up and saw the buffalo on his side, his legs out, his thinly-haired belly crawling with ticks.“Hell of a good bull,”his brain registered automatically.“A good fifty inches, or better. Better.”He called to the driver and told him to spread a blanket over the body and stay by it. Then he walked over to the motor car where the woman sat crying in the corner.

“That was a pretty thing to do,”he said in a toneless voice.“He would have left you too.”

“Stop it,”she said.

“Of course it's an accident,”he said.“I know that.”

“Stop it,”she said.

“Don't worry,”he said.“There will be a certain amount of unpleasantness but I will have some photographs taken that will be very useful at the inquest. There's the testimony of the gun-bearers and the driver too. You're perfectly all right.”

“Stop it,”she said.

“There's a hell of a lot to be done,”he said.“And I'll have to send a truck off to the lake to wireless for a plane to take the three of us into Nairobi. Why didn't you poison him? That's what they do in England.”

“Stop it. Stop it. Stop it,”the woman cried.

Wilson looked at her with his flat blue eyes.

“I'm through now,”he said.“I was a little angry. I'd begun to like your husband.”

“Oh, please stop it,”she said.“Please stop it.”

“That's better,”Wilson said.“Please is much better. Now I'll stop.”





The Capital of the World


Madrid is full of boys named Paco, which is the diminutive of the name Francisco, and there is a Madrid joke about a father who came to Madrid and inserted an advertisement in the personal columns of El Liberal which said: PACO MEET ME AT HOTEL MONTANA NOON TUESDAY ALL IS FORGIVEN PAPA and how a squadron of Guardia Civil had to be called out to disperse the eight hundred young men who answered the advertisement. But this Paco, who waited on table at the Pension Luarca, had no father to forgive him, nor anything for the father to forgive. He had two older sisters who were chambermaids at the Luarca, who had gotten their place through coming from the same small village as a former Luarca chambermaid who had proven hardworking and honest and hence given her village and its products a good name; and these sisters had paid his way on the auto-bus to Madrid and gotten him his job as an apprentice waiter. He came from a village in a part of Extramadura where conditions were incredibly primitive, food scarce, and comforts unknown and he had worked hard ever since he could remember.

He was a well built boy with very black, rather curly hair, good teeth and a skin that his sisters envied, and he had a ready and unpuzzled smile. He was fast on his feet and did his work well and he loved his sisters, who seemed beautiful and sophisticated; he loved Madrid, which was still an unbelievable place, and he loved his work which, done under bright lights, with clean linen, the wearing of evening clothes, and abundant food in the kitchen, seemed romantically beautiful.

There were from eight to a dozen other people who lived at the Luarca and ate in the dining room but for Paco, the youngest of the three waiters who served at table, the only ones who really existed were the bullfighters.

Second-rate matadors lived at that pension because the address in the Calle San Jeronimo was good, the food was excellent and the room and board was cheap. It is necessary for a bull fighter to give the appearance, if not of prosperity, at least of respectability, since decorum and dignity rank above courage as the virtues most highly prized in Spain, and bullfighters stayed at the Luarca until their last pesetas were gone. There is no record of any bullfighter having left the Luarca for a better or more expensive hotel; second-rate bullfighters never became first rate; but the descent from the Luarca was swift since any one could stay there who was making anything at all and a bill was never presented to a guest unasked until the woman who ran the place knew that the case was hopeless.

At this time there were three full matadors living at the Luarca as well as two very good picadors, and one excellent banderillero. The Luarca was luxury for the picadors and the banderilleros who, with their families in Seville, required lodging in Madrid during the Spring season; but they were well paid and in the fixed employ of fighters who were heavily contracted during the coming season and the three of these subalterns would probably make much more apiece than any of the three matadors. Of the three matadors one was ill and trying to conceal it; one had passed his short vogue as a novelty; and the third was a coward.

The coward had at one time, until he had received a peculiarly atrocious horn wound in the lower abdomen at the start of his first season as a full matador, been exceptionally brave and remarkably skillful and he still had many of the hearty mannerisms of his days of success. He was jovial to excess and laughed constantly with and without provocation. He had, when successful, been very addicted to practical jokes but he had given them up now. They took an assurance that he did not feel. This matador had an intelligent, very open face and he carried himself with much style.

The matador who was ill was careful never to show it and was meticulous about eating a little of all the dishes that were presented at the table. He had a great many handkerchiefs which he laundered himself in his room and, lately, he had been selling his fighting suits. He had sold one, cheaply, before Christmas and another in the first week of April. They had been very expensive suits, had always been well kept and he had one more. Before he had become ill he had been a very promising, even a sensational, fighter and, while he himself could not read, he had clippings which said that in his debut in Madrid he had been better than Belmonte. He ate alone at a small table and looked up very little.

The matador who had once been a novelty was very short and brown and very dignified. He also ate alone at a separate table and he smiled very rarely and never laughed. He came from Valladolid, where the people are extremely serious, and he was a capable matador; but his style had become old-fashioned before he had ever succeeded in endearing himself to the public through his virtues, which were courage and a calm capability, and his name on a poster would draw no one to a bull ring. His novelty had been that he was so short that he could barely see over the bull's withers, but there were other short fighters, and he had never succeeded in imposing himself on the public's fancy.

Of the picadors one was a thin, hawk-faced, gray-haired man, lightly built but with legs and arms like iron, who always wore cattlemen's boots under his trousers, drank too much every evening and gazed amorously at any woman in the pension. The other was huge, dark, brown-faced, good-looking, with black hair like an Indian and enormous hands. Both were great picadors although the first was reputed to have lost much of his ability through drink and dissipation, and the second was said to be too headstrong and quarrelsome to stay with any matador more than a single season.

The banderillero was middle-aged, gray, cat-quick in spite of his years and, sitting at the table he looked a moderately prosperous business man. His legs were still good for this season, and when they should go he was intelligent and experienced enough to keep regularly employed for a long time. The difference would be that when his speed of foot would be gone he would always be frightened where now he was assured and calm in the ring and out of it.

On this evening every one had left the dining room except the hawk-faced picador who drank too much, the birthmarked-faced auctioneer of watches at the fairs and festivals of Spain, who also drank too much, and two priests from Galicia who were sitting at a corner table and drinking if not too much certainly enough. At that time wine was included in the price of the room and board at the Luarca and the waiters had just brought fresh bottles of Valdepe.as to the tables of the auctioneer, then to the picador and, finally, to the two priests.

The three waiters stood at the end of the room. It was the rule of the house that they should all remain on duty until the diners whose tables they were responsible for should all have left, but the one who served the table of the two priests had an appointment to go to an Anarcho-Syndicalist meeting and Paco had agreed to take over his table for him.

Upstairs the matador who was ill was lying face down on his bed alone. The matador who was no longer a novelty was sitting looking out of his window preparatory to walking out to the café. The matador who was a coward had the older sister of Paco in his room with him and was trying to get her to do something which she was laughingly refusing to do. This matador was saying“Come on, little savage.”

“No,”said the sister.“Why should I?”

“For a favor.”

“You've eaten and now you want me for dessert.”

“Just once. What harm can it do?”

“Leave me alone. Leave me alone, I tell you.”

“It is a very little thing to do.”

“Leave me alone, I tell you.”

Down in the dining room the tallest of the waiters, who was overdue at the meeting, said“Look at those black pigs drink.”

“That's no way to speak,”said the second waiter.“They are decent clients. They do not drink too much.”

“For me it is a good way to speak,”said the tall one.“There are the two curses of Spain, the bulls and the priests.”

“Certainly not the individual bull and the individual priest,”said the second waiter.

“Yes,”said the tall waiter.“Only through the individual can you attack the class. It is necessary to kill the individual bull and the individual priest. All of them. Then there are no more.”

“Save it for the meeting,”said the other waiter.

“Look at the barbarity of Madrid,”said the tall waiter.“It is now half-past eleven o'clock and these are still guzzling.”

“They only started to eat at ten,”said the other waiter.“As you know there are many dishes. That wine is cheap and these have paid for it. It is not a strong wine.”

“How can there be solidarity of workers with fools like you?”asked the tall waiter.

“Look,”said the second waiter who was a man of fifty.“I have worked all my life. In all that remains of my life I must work. I have no complaints against work. To work is normal.”

“Yes, but the lack of work kills.”

“I have always worked,”said the older waiter.“Go on to the meeting. There is no necessity to stay.”

“You are a good comrade,”said the tall waiter.“But you lack all ideology.”

“Mejor si me falta eso que el otro,”said the older waiter (meaning it is better to lack that than work).“Go on to the mitin.”

Paco had said nothing. He did not yet understand politics but it always gave him a thrill to hear the tall waiter speak of the necessity for killing the priests and the Guardia Civil. The tall waiter represented to him revolution and revolution also was romantic. He himself would like to be a good Catholic, a revolutionary, and have a steady job like this, while, at the same time, being a bullfighter.

“Go on to the meeting, Ignacio,”he said.“I will respond for your work.”

“The two of us,”said the older waiter.

“There isn't enough for one,”said Paco.“Go on to the meeting.”

“Pues, me voy,”said the tall waiter.“And thanks.”

In the meantime, upstairs, the sister of Paco had gotten out of the embrace of the matador as skilfully as a wrestler breaking a hold and said, now angry,“These are the hungry people. A failed bullfighter. With your ton-load of fear. If you have so much of that, use it in the ring.”

“That is the way a whore talks.”

“A whore is also a woman, but I am not a whore.”

“You'll be one.”

“Not through you.”

“Leave me,”said the matador who, now, repulsed and refused, felt the nakedness of his cowardice returning.

“Leave you? What hasn't left you?”said the sister.“Don't you want me to make up the bed? I'm paid to do that.”

“Leave me,”said the matador, his broad good-looking face wrinkled into a contortion that was like crying.“You whore. You dirty little whore.”

“Matador,”she said, shutting the door.“My matador.”

Inside the room the matador sat on the bed. His face still had the contortion which, in the ring, he made into a constant smile which frightened those people in the first rows of seats who knew what they were watching.“And this,”he was saying aloud.“And this. And this.”

He could remember when he had been good and it had only been three years before. He could remember the weight of the heavy gold-brocaded fighting jacket on his shoulders on that hot afternoon in May when his voice had still been the same in the ring as in the café, and how he sighted along the point-dipping blade at the place in the top of the shoulders where it was dusty in the short-haired black hump of muscle above the wide, wood-knocking, splintered-tipped horns that lowered as he went in to kill, and how the sword pushed in as easy as into a mound of stiff butter with the palm of his hand pushing the pommel, his left arm crossed low, his left shoulder forward, his weight on his left leg, and then his weight wasn't on his leg. His weight was on his lower belly and as the bull raised his head the horn was out of sight in him and he swung over on it twice before they pulled him off it. So now when he went into kill, and it was seldom, he could not look at the horns and what did any whore know about what he went through before be fought? And what had they been through that laughed at him? They were all whores and they knew what they could do with it.

Down in the dining room the picador sat looking at the priests. If there were women in the room he stared at them. If there were no women he would stare with enjoyment at a foreigner, un inglés, but lacking women or strangers, he now stared with enjoyment and insolence at the two priests. While he stared the birth-marked auctioneer rose and folding his napkin went out, leaving over half the wine in the last bottle he had ordered. If his accounts had been paid up at the Luarca he would have finished the bottle.

The two priests did not stare back at the picador. One of them was saying,“It is ten days since I have been here waiting to see him and all day I sit in the ante-chamber and he will not receive me.”

“What is there to do?”

“Nothing. What can one do? One cannot go against authority.”

“I have been here for two weeks and nothing. I wait and they will not see me.”

“We are from the abandoned country. When the money runs out we can return.”

“To the abandoned country. What does Madrid care about Galicia? We are a poor province.”

“One understands the action of our brother Basilio.”

“Still I have no real confidence in the integrity of Basilio Alvarez.”

“Madrid is where one learns to understand. Madrid kills Spain.”

“If they would simply see one and refuse.”

“No. You must be broken and worn out by waiting.”

“Well, we shall see. I can wait as well as another.”

At this moment the picador got to his feet, walked over to the priests' table and stood, gray-headed and hawk-faced, staring at them and smiling.

“A torero,”said one priest to the other.

“And a good one,”said the picador and walked out of the dining room, gray-jacketed, trim-waisted, bow-legged, in tight breeches over his high-heeled cattlemen's boots that clicked on the floor as he swaggered quite steadily, smiling to himself. He lived in a small, tight, professional world of personal efficiency, nightly alcoholic triumph, and insolence. Now he lit a cigar and tilting his hat at an angle in the hallway went out to the café.

The priests left immediately after the picador, hurriedly conscious of being the last people in the dining room, and there was no one in the room now but Paco and the middle-aged waiter. They cleared the tables and carried the bottles into the kitchen.

In the kitchen was the boy who washed the dishes. He was three years older than Paco and was very cynical and bitter.

“Take this,”the middle-aged waiter said, and poured out a glass of the Valdepe.as and handed it to him.

“Why not?”the boy took the glass.

“Tu, Paco?”the older waiter asked.

“Thank you,”said Paco. The three of them drank.

“I will be going,”said the middle-aged waiter.

“Good night,”they told him.

He went out and they were alone. Paco took a napkin one of the priests had used and standing straight, his heels planted, lowered the napkin and with head following the movement, swung his arms in the motion of a slow sweeping verónica. He turned, and advancing his right foot slightly, made the second pass, gained a little terrain on the imaginary bull and made a third pass, slow, perfectly timed and suave, then gathered the napkin to his waist and swung his hips away from the bull in a media-verónica.

The dishwasher, whose name was Enrique, watched him critically and sneeringly.

“How is the bull?”he said.

“Very brave,”said Paco.“Look.”

Standing slim and straight he made four more perfect passes, smooth, elegant and graceful.

“And the bull?”asked Enrique standing against the sink, holding his wine glass and wearing his apron.

“Still has lots of gas,”said Paco.

“You make me sick,”said Enrique.

“Why?”

“Look.”

Enrique removed his apron and citing the imaginary bull he sculptured four perfect, languid gypsy verónicas and ended up with a rebolera that made the apron swing in a stiff arc past the bull's nose as he walked away from him.

“Look at that,”he said.“And I wash dishes.”

“Why?”

“Fear,”said Enrique.“Miedo. The same fear you would have in a ring with a bull.”

“No,”said Paco.“I wouldn't be afraid.”

“Leche!”said Enrique.“Every one is afraid. But a torero can control his fear so that he can work the bull. I went in an amateur fight and I was so afraid I couldn't keep from running. Every one thought it was very funny. So would you be afraid. If it wasn't for fear every bootblack in Spain would be a bullfighter. You, a country boy, would be frightened worse than I was.”

“No,”said Paco.

He had done it too many times in his imagination. Too many times he had seen the horns, seen the bull's wet muzzle, the ear twitching, then the head go down and the charge, the hoofs thudding and the hot bull pass him as he swung the cape, to re-charge as he swung the cape again, then again, and again, and again, to end winding the bull around him in his great media-verónica, and walk swingingly away, with bull hairs caught in the gold ornaments of his jacket from the close passes; the bull standing hypnotized and the crowd applauding. No, he would not be afraid. Others, yes. Not he. He knew he would not be afraid. Even if he ever was afraid he knew that he could do it anyway. He had confidence.“I wouldn't be afraid,”he said.

Enrique said,“Leche,”again.

Then he said,“If we should try it?”

“How?”

“Look,”said Enrique.“You think of the bull but you do not think of the horns. The bull has such force that the horns rip like a knife, they stab like a bayonet, and they kill like a club. Look,”he opened a table drawer and took out two meat knives.“I will bind these to the legs of a chair. Then I will play bull for you with the chair held before my head. The knives are the horns. If you make those passes then they mean something.”

“Lend me your apron,”said Paco.“We'll do it in the dining room.”

“No,”said Enrique, suddenly not bitter.“Don't do it, Paco.”

“Yes,”said Paco.“I'm not afraid.”

“You will be when you see the knives come.”

“We'll see,”said Paco.“Give me the apron.”

At this time, while Enrique was binding the two heavy-bladed razor-sharp meat knives fast to the legs of the chair with two soiled napkins holding the half of each knife, wrapping them tight and then knotting them, the two chambermaids, Paco's sisters, were on their way to the cinema to see Greta Garbo in Anna Christie. Of the two priests, one was sitting in his underwear reading his breviary and the other was wearing a nightshirt and saying the rosary. All the bullfighters except the one who was ill had made their evening appearance at the Café Fornos, where the big, dark-haired picador was playing billiards, the short, serious matador was sitting at a crowded table before a coffee and milk, along with the middle-aged banderillero and other serious workmen.

The drinking, gray-headed picador was sitting with a glass of cazalas brandy before him staring with pleasure at a table where the matador whose courage was gone sat with another matador who had renounced the sword to become a banderillero again, and two very houseworn-looking prostitutes.

The auctioneer stood on the street corner talking with friends. The tall waiter was at the Anarcho-Syndicalist meeting waiting for an opportunity to speak. The middle-aged waiter was seated on the terrace of the Café Alvarez drinking a small beer. The woman who owned the Luarca was already asleep in her bed, where she lay on her back with the bolster between her legs; big, fat, honest, clean, easy-going, very religious and never having ceased to miss or pray daily for her husband, dead, now, twenty years. In his room, alone, the matador who was ill lay face down on his bed with his mouth against a handkerchief.

Now, in the deserted dining room, Enrique tied the last knot in the napkins that bound the knives to the chair legs and lifted the chair. He pointed the legs with the knives on them forward and held the chair over his head with the two knives pointing straight ahead, one on each side of his head.

“It's heavy,”he said.“Look, Paco. It is very dangerous. Don't do it.”He was sweating.

Paco stood facing him, holding the apron spread, holding a fold of it bunched in each hand, thumbs up, first finger down, spread to catch the eye of the bull.

“Charge straight,”he said.“Turn like a bull. Charge as many times as you want.”

“How will you know when to cut the pass?”asked Enrique.“It's better to do three and then a media.”

“All right,”said Paco.“But come straight. Huh, torito! Come on, little bull!”

Running with head down Enrique came toward him and Paco swung the apron just ahead of the knife blade as it passed close in front of his belly and as it went by it was, to him, the real horn, white-tipped, black, smooth, and as Enrique passed him and turned to rush again it was the hot, blood-flanked mass of the bull that thudded by, then turned like a cat and came again as he swung the cape slowly. Then the bull turned and came again and, as he watched the onrushing point, he stepped his left foot two inches too far forward and the knife did not pass, but had slipped in as easily as into a wineskin and there was a hot scalding rush above and around the sudden inner rigidity of steel and Enrique shouting.“Ay! Ay! Let me get it out! Let me get it out!”and Paco slipped forward on the chair, the apron cape still held, Enrique pulling on the chair as the knife turned in him, in him, Paco.

The knife was out now and he sat on the floor in the widening warm pool.

“Put the napkin over it. Hold it!”said Enrique.“Hold it tight. I will run for the doctor. You must hold in the hemorrhage.”

“There should be a rubber cup,”said Paco. He had seen that used in the ring.

“I came straight,”said Enrique, crying.“All I wanted was to show the danger.”

“Don't worry,”said Paco, his voice sounding far away.“But bring the doctor.”

In the ring they lifted you and carried you, running with you, to the operating room. If the femoral artery emptied itself before you reached there they called the priest.

“Advise one of the priests,”said Paco, holding the napkin tight against his lower abdomen. He could not believe that this had happened to him.

But Enrique was running down the Calle San Jerónimo to the all-night first-aid station and Paco was alone, first sitting up, then huddled over, then slumped on the floor, until it was over, feeling his life go out of him as dirty water empties from a bathtub when the plug is drawn. He was frightened and he felt faint and he tried to say an act of contrition and he remembered how it started but before he had said, as fast as he could,“Oh, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee who art worthy of all my love and I firmly resolve...,”he felt too faint and he was lying face down on the floor and it was over very quickly. A severed femoral artery empties itself faster than you can believe.

As the doctor from the first-aid station came up the stairs accompanied by a policeman who held on to Enrique by the arm, the two sisters of Paco were still in the moving-picture palace of the Gran Via, where they were intensely disappointed in the Garbo film, which showed the great star in miserable low surroundings when they had been accustomed to see her surrounded by great luxury and brilliance. The audience disliked the film thoroughly and were protesting by whistling and stamping their feet. All the other people from the hotel were doing almost what they had been doing when the accident happened, except that the two priests had finished their devotions and were preparing for sleep, and the gray-haired picador had moved his drink over to the table with the two houseworn prostitutes. A little later he went out of the café with one of them. It was the one for whom the matador who had lost his nerve had been buying drinks.

The boy Paco had never known about any of this nor about what all these people would be doing on the next day and on other days to come. He had no idea how they really lived nor how they ended. He did not even realize they ended. He died, as the Spanish phrase has it, full of illusions. He had not had time in his life to lose any of them, nor even, at the end, to complete an act of contrition. He had not even had time to be disappointed in the Garbo picture which disappointed all Madrid for a week.





The Snows of Kilimanjaro


Kilimanjaro is a snow-covered mountain 19710 feet high, and is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai“Ngàje Ngài,”the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude.

“The marvellous thing is that it's painless,”he said.“That's how you know when it starts.”

“Is it really?”

“Absolutely. I'm awfully sorry about the odor though. That must bother you.”

“Don't! Please don't.”

“Look at them,”he said.“Now is it sight or is it scent that brings them like that?”

The cot the man lay on was in the wide shade of a mimosa tree and as he looked out past the shade onto the glare of the plain there were three of the big birds squatted obscenely, while in the sky a dozen more sailed, making quick-moving shadows as they passed.

“They've been there since the day the truck broke down,”he said.“Today's the first time any have lit on the ground. I watched the way they sailed very carefully at first in case I ever wanted to use them in a story. That's funny now.”

“I wish you wouldn't,”she said.

“I'm only talking,”he said.“It's much easier if I talk. But I don't want to bother you.”

“You know it doesn't bother me,”she said.“It's that I've gotten so very nervous not being able to do anything. I think we might make it as easy as we can until the plane comes.”

“Or until the plane doesn't come.”

“Please tell me what I can do. There must be something I can do.”

“You can take the leg off and that might stop it, though I doubt it. Or you can shoot me. You're a good shot now. I taught you to shoot, didn't I?”

“Please don't talk that way. Couldn't I read to you?”

“Read what?”

“Anything in the book bag that we haven't read.”

“I can't listen to it,”he said.“Talking is the easiest. We quarrel and that makes the time pass.”

“I don't quarrel. I never want to quarrel. Let's not quarrel any more. No matter how nervous we get. Maybe they will be back with another truck today. Maybe the plane will come.”

“I don't want to move,”the man said.“There is no sense in moving now except to make it easier for you.”

“That's cowardly.”

“Can't you let a man die as comfortably as he can without calling him names? What's the use of slanging me?”

“You're not going to die.”

“Don't be silly. I'm dying now. Ask those bastards.”He looked over to where the huge, filthy birds sat, their naked heads sunk in the hunched feathers. A fourth planed down, to run quick-legged and then waddle slowly toward the others.

“They are around every camp. You never notice them. You can't die if you don't give up.”

“Where did you read that? You're such a bloody fool.”

“You might think about some one else.”

“For Christ's sake,”he said,“that's been my trade.”

He lay then and was quiet for a while and looked across the heat shimmer of the plain to the edge of the bush. There were a few Tommies that showed minute and white against the yellow and, far off, he saw a herd of zebra, white against the green of the bush. This was a pleasant camp under big trees against a hill, with good water, and close by, a nearly dry water hole where sand grouse flighted in the mornings.

“Wouldn't you like me to read?”she asked. She was sitting on a canvas chair beside his cot.“There's a breeze coming up.”

“No thanks.”

“Maybe the truck will come.”

“I don't give a damn about the truck.”

“I do.”

“You give a damn about so many things that I don't.”

“Not so many, Harry.”

“What about a drink?”

“It's supposed to be bad for you. It said in Black's to avoid all alcohol. You shouldn't drink.”

“Molo!”he shouted.

“Yes Bwana.”

“Bring whiskey-soda.”

“Yes Bwana.”

“You shouldn't,”she said.“That's what I mean by giving up. It says it's bad for you. I know it's bad for you.”

“No,”he said.“It's good for me.”

So now it was all over, he thought. So now he would never have a chance to finish it. So this was the way it ended, in a bickering over a drink. Since the gangrene started in his right leg he had no pain and with the pain the horror had gone and all he felt now was a great tiredness and anger that this was the end of it. For this, that now was coming, he had very little curiosity. For years it had obsessed him; but now it meant nothing in itself. It was strange how easy being tired enough made it.

Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well. Well, he would not have to fail at trying to write them either. Maybe you could never write them, and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting. Well he would never know, now.

“I wish we'd never come,”the woman said. She was looking at him, holding the glass and biting her lip.“You never would have gotten anything like this in Paris. You always said you loved Paris. We could have stayed in Paris or gone anywhere. I'd have gone anywhere. I said I'd go anywhere you wanted. If you wanted to shoot we could have gone shooting in Hungary and been comfortable.”

“Your bloody money,”he said.

“That's not fair,”she said.“It was always yours as much as mine. I left everything and I went wherever you wanted to go and I've done what you wanted to do. But I wish we'd never come here.”

“You said you loved it.”

“I did when you were all right. But now I hate it. I don't see why that had to happen to your leg. What have we done to have that happen to us?”

“I suppose what I did was to forget to put iodine on it when I first scratched it. Then I didn't pay any attention to it because I never infect. Then, later, when it got bad, it was probably using that weak carbolic solution when the other antiseptics ran out that paralyzed the minute blood vessels and started the gangrene.”He looked at her,“What else?”

“I don't mean that.”

“If we would have hired a good mechanic instead of a half-baked Kikuyu driver, he would have checked the oil and never burned out that bearing in the truck.”

“I don't mean that.”

“If you hadn't left your own people, your goddamned Old Westbury, Saratoga, Palm Beach people to take me on—”

“Why, I loved you. That's not fair. I love you now. I'll always love you. Don't you love me?”

“No,”said the man.“I don't think so. I never have.”

“Harry, what are you saying? You're out of your head.”

“No. I haven't any head to go out of.”

“Don't drink that,”she said.“Darling, please don't drink that. We have to do everything we can.”

“You do it,”he said.“I'm tired.”




Now in his mind he saw a railway station at Karagatch and he was standing with his pack and that was the headlight of the Simplon-Orient cutting the dark now and he was leaving Thrace then after the retreat. That was one of the things he had saved to write, with, in the morning at breakfast, looking out the window and seeing snow on the mountains in Bulgaria and Nansen's Secretary asking the old man if it were snow and the old man looking at it and saying, No, that's not snow. It's too early for snow. And the Secretary repeating to the other girls, No, you see. It's not snow and them all saying, It's not snow we were mistaken. But it was the snow all right and he sent them on into it when he evolved exchange of populations. And it was snow they tramped along in until they died that winter.

It was snow too that fell all Christmas week that year up in the Gauertal, that year they lived in the woodcutter's house with the big square porcelain stove that filled half the room, and they slept on mattresses filled with beech leaves, the time the deserter came with his feet bloody in the snow. He said the police were right behind him and they gave him woolen socks and held the gendarmes talking until the tracks had drifted over.

In Schrunz, on Christmas day, the snow was so bright it hurt your eyes when you looked out from the Weinstube and saw every one coming home from church. That was where they walked up the sleigh-smoothed urine-yellowed road along the river with the steep pine hills, skis heavy on the shoulder, and where they ran that great run down the glacier above the Madlener-haus, the snow as smooth to see as cake frosting and as light as powder and he remembered the noiseless rush the speed made as you dropped down like a bird.

They were snow-bound a week in the Madlener-haus that time in the blizzard playing cards in the smoke by the lantern light and the stakes were higher all the time as Herr Lent lost more. Finally he lost it all. Everything, the Skischule money and all the season's profit and then his capital. He could see him with his long nose, picking up the cards and then opening,“Sans Voir.”There was always gambling then. When there was no snow you gambled and when there was too much you gambled. He thought of all the time in his life he had spent gambling.

But he had never written a line of that, nor of that cold, bright Christmas day with the mountains showing across the plain that Barker had flown across the lines to bomb the Austrian officers' leave train, machine-gunning them as they scattered and ran. He remembered Barker afterwards coming into the mess and starting to tell about it. And how quiet it got and then somebody saying,“You bloody murderous bastard.”

Those were the same Austrians they killed then that he skied with later. No not the same. Hans, that he skied with all that year, had been in the Kaiser-J.gers and when they went hunting hares together up the little valley above the saw-mill they had talked of the fighting on Pasubio and of the attack on Perticara and Asalone and he had never written a word of that. Nor of Monte Corona, nor the Sette Communi, nor of Arsiero.

How many winters had he lived in the Vorarlberg and the Arlberg? It was four and then he remembered the man who had the fox to sell when they had walked into Bludenz, that time to buy presents, and the cherry-pit taste of good kirsch, the fast-slipping rush of running powder-snow on crust, singing“Hi! Ho! said Rolly!”as you ran down the last stretch to the steep drop, taking it straight, then running the orchard in three turns and out across the ditch and onto the icy road behind the inn. Knocking your bindings loose, kicking the skis free and leaning them up against the wooden wall of the inn, the lamplight coming from the window, where inside, in the smoky, new-wine smelling warmth, they were playing the accordion.




“Where did we stay in Paris?”he asked the woman who was sitting by him in a canvas chair, now, in Africa.

“At the Crillon. You know that.”

“Why do I know that?”

“That's where we always stayed.”

“No. Not always.”

“There and at the Pavillion Henri-Quatre in St. Germain. You said you loved it there.”

“Love is a dunghill,”said Harry.“And I'm the cock that gets on it to crow.”

“If you have to go away,”she said,“is it absolutely necessary to kill off everything you leave behind? I mean do you have to take away everything? Do you have to kill your horse, and your wife and burn your saddle and your armour?”

“Yes,”he said.“Your damned money was my armour. My Swift and my Armour.”

“Don't.”

“All right. I'll stop that. I don't want to hurt you.”

“It's a little bit late now.”

“All right then. I'll go on hurting you. It's more amusing. The only thing I ever really liked to do with you I can't do now.”

“No, that's not true. You liked to do many things and everything you wanted to do I did.”

“Oh, for Christ sake stop bragging, will you?”

He looked at her and saw her crying.

“Listen,”he said.“Do you think that it is fun to do this? I don't know why I'm doing it. It's trying to kill to keep yourself alive, I imagine. I was all right when we started talking. I didn't mean to start this, and now I'm crazy as a coot and being as cruel to you as I can be. Don't pay any attention, darling, to what I say. I love you, really. You know I love you. I've never loved any one else the way I love you.”

He slipped into the familiar lie he made his bread and butter by.

“You're sweet to me.”

“You bitch,”he said.“You rich bitch. That's poetry. I'm full of poetry now. Rot and poetry. Rotten poetry.”

“Stop it. Harry, why do you have to turn into a devil now?”

“I don't like to leave anything,”the man said.“I don't like to leave things behind.”




It was evening now and he had been asleep. The sun was gone behind the hill and there was a shadow all across the plain and the small animals were feeding close to camp; quick dropping heads and switching tails, he watched them keeping well out away from the bush now. The birds no longer waited on the ground. They were all perched heavily in a tree. There were many more of them. His personal boy was sitting by the bed.

“Memsahib's gone to shoot,”the boy said.“Does Bwana want?”

“Nothing.”

She had gone to kill a piece of meat and, knowing how he liked to watch the game, she had gone well away so she would not disturb this little pocket of the plain that he could see. She was always thoughtful, he thought. On anything she knew about, or had read, or that she had ever heard.

It was not her fault that when he went to her he was already over. How could a woman know that you meant nothing that you said; that you spoke only from habit and to be comfortable? After he no longer meant what he said, his lies were more successful with women than when he had told them the truth.

It was not so much that he lied as that there was no truth to tell. He had had his life and it was over and then he went on living it again with different people and more money, with the best of the same places, and some new ones.

You kept from thinking and it was all marvellous. You were equipped with good insides so that you did not go to pieces that way, the way most of them had, and you made an attitude that you cared nothing for the work you used to do, now that you could no longer do it. But, in yourself, you said that you would write about these people; about the very rich; that you were really not of them but a spy in their country; that you would leave it and write of it and for once it would be written by some one who knew what he was writing of. But he would never do it, because each day of not writing, of comfort, of being that which he despised, dulled his ability and softened his will to work so that, finally, he did no work at all. The people he knew now were all much more comfortable when he did not work. Africa was where he had been happiest in the good time of his life, so he had come out here to start again. They had made this safari with the minimum of comfort. There was no hardship; but there was no luxury and he had thought that he could get back into training that way. That in some way he could work the fat off his soul the way a fighter went into the mountains to work and train in order to bum it out of his body.

She had liked it. She said she loved it. She loved anything that was exciting, that involved a change of scene, where there were new people and where things were pleasant. And he had felt the illusion of returning strength of will to work. Now if this was how it ended, and he knew it was, he must not turn like some snake biting itself because its back was broken. It wasn't this woman's fault. If it had not been she it would have been another. If he lived by a lie he should try to die by it. He heard a shot beyond the hill.

She shot very well this good, this rich bitch, this kindly caretaker and destroyer of his talent. Nonsense. He had destroyed his talent himself. Why should he blame this woman because she kept him well? He had destroyed his talent by not using it, by betrayals of himself and what he believed in, by drinking so much that he blunted the edge of his perceptions, by laziness, by sloth, and by snobbery, by pride and by prejudice, by hook and by crook. What was this? A catalogue of old books? What was his talent anyway? It was a talent all right but instead of using it, he had traded on it. It was never what he had done, but always what he could do. And he had chosen to make his living with something else instead of a pen or a pencil. It was strange, too, wasn't it, that when he fell in love with another woman, that woman should always have more money than the last one? But when he no longer was in love, when he was only lying, as to this woman, now, who had the most money of all, who had all the money there was, who had had a husband and children, who had taken lovers and been dissatisfied with them, and who loved him dearly as a writer, as a man, as a companion and as a proud possession; it was strange that when he did not love her at all and was lying, that he should be able to give her more for her money than when he had really loved.

We must all be cut out for what we do, he thought. However you make your living is where your talent lies. He had sold vitality, in one form or another, all his life and when your affections are not too involved you give much better value for the money. He had found that out but he would never write that, now, either. No, he would not write that, although it was well worth writing.

Now she came in sight, walking across the open toward the camp. She was wearing jodphurs and carrying her rifle. The two boys had a Tommie slung and they were coming along behind her. She was still a good-looking woman, he thought, and she had a pleasant body. She had a great talent and appreciation for the bed, she was not pretty, but he liked her face, she read enormously, liked to ride and shoot and, certainly, she drank too much. Her husband had died when she was still a comparatively young woman and for a while she had devoted herself to her two just-grown children, who did not need her and were embarrassed at having her about, to her stable of horses, to books, and to bottles. She liked to read in the evening before dinner and she drank Scotch and soda while she read. By dinner she was fairly drunk and after a bottle of wine at dinner she was usually drunk enough to sleep.

That was before the lovers. After she had the lovers she did not drink so much because she did not have to be drunk to sleep. But the lovers bored her. She had been married to a man who had never bored her and these people bored her very much.

Then one of her two children was killed in a plane crash and after that was over she did not want the lovers, and drink being no anaesthetic she had to make another life. Suddenly, she had been acutely frightened of being alone. But she wanted some one that she respected with her.

It had begun very simply. She liked what he wrote and she had always envied the life he led. She thought he did exactly what he wanted to. The steps by which she had acquired him and the way in which she had finally fallen in love with him were all part of a regular progression in which she had built herself a new life and he had traded away what remained of his old life.

He had traded it for security, for comfort too, there was no denying that, and for what else? He did not know. She would have bought him anything he wanted. He knew that. She was a damned nice woman too. He would as soon be in bed with her as any one; rather with her, because she was richer, because she was very pleasant and appreciative and because she never made scenes. And now this life that she had built again was coming to a term because he had not used iodine two weeks ago when a thorn had scratched his knee as they moved forward trying to photograph a herd of waterbuck standing, their heads up, peering while their nostrils searched the air, their ears spread wide to hear the first noise that would send them rushing into the bush. They had bolted, too, before he got the picture.

Here she came now.

He turned his head on the cot to look toward her.“Hello,”he said.

“I shot a Tommy ram,”she told him.“He'll make you good broth and I'll have them mash some potatoes with the Klim. How do you feel?”

“Much better.”

“Isn't that lovely? You know I thought perhaps you would. You were sleeping when I left.”

“I had a good sleep. Did you walk far?”

“No. Just around behind the hill. I made quite a good shot on the Tommy.”

“You shoot marvellously, you know.”

“I love it. I've loved Africa. Really. If you're all right it's the most fun that I've ever had. You don't know the fun it's been to shoot with you. I've loved the country.”

“I love it too.”

“Darling, you don't know how marvellous it is to see you feeling better. I couldn't stand it when you felt that way. You won't talk to me like that again, will you? Promise me?”

“No,”he said.“I don't remember what I said.”

“You don't have to destroy me. Do you? I'm only a middle-aged woman who loves you and wants to do what you want to do. I've been destroyed two or three times already. You wouldn't want to destroy me again, would you?”

“I'd like to destroy you a few times in bed,”he said.

“Yes. That's the good destruction. That's the way we're made to be destroyed. The plane will be here tomorrow.”

“How do you know?”

“I'm sure. It's bound to come. The boys have the wood all ready and the grass to make the smudge. I went down and looked at it again today. There's plenty of room to land and we have the smudges ready at both ends.”

“What makes you think it will come tomorrow?”

“I'm sure it will. It's overdue now. Then, in town, they will fix up your leg and then we will have some good destruction. Not that dreadful talking kind.”

“Should we have a drink? The sun is down.”

“Do you think you should?”

“I'm having one.”

“We'll have one together. Molo, letti dui whiskey-soda!”she called.

“You'd better put on your mosquito boots,”he told her.

“I'll wait till I bathe...”

While it grew dark they drank and just before it was dark and there was no longer enough light to shoot, a hyena crossed the open on his way around the hill.

“That bastard crosses there every night,”the man said.“Every night for two weeks.”

“He's the one makes the noise at night. I don't mind it. They're a filthy animal though.”

Drinking together, with no pain now except the discomfort of lying in the one position, the boys lighting a fire, its shadow jumping on the tents, he could feel the return of acquiescence in this life of pleasant surrender. She was very good to him. He had been cruel and unjust in the afternoon. She was a fine woman, marvellous really. And just then it occurred to him that he was going to die.

It came with a rush; not as a rush of water nor of wind; but of a sudden evil-smelling emptiness and the odd thing was that the hyena slipped lightly along the edge of it.

“What is it, Harry?”she asked him.

“Nothing,”he said.“You had better move over to the other side. To windward.”

“Did Molo change the dressing?”

“Yes. I'm just using the boric now.”

“How do you feel?”

“A little wobbly.”

“I'm going in to bathe,”she said.“I'll be right out. I'll eat with you and then we'll put the cot in.”

So, he said to himself, we did well to stop the quarrelling. He had never quarrelled much with this woman, while with the women that he loved he had quarrelled so much they had finally, always, with the corrosion of the quarrelling, killed what they had together. He had loved too much, demanded too much, and he wore it all out.

He thought about alone in Constantinople that time, having quarrelled in Paris before he had gone out. He had whored the whole time and then, when that was over, and he had failed to kill his loneliness, but only made it worse, he had written her, the first one, the one who left him, a letter telling her how he had never been able to kill it....How when he thought he saw her outside the Regence one time it made him go all faint and sick inside, and that he would follow a woman who looked like her in some way, along the Boulevard, afraid to see it was not she, afraid to lose the feeling it gave him. How every one he had slept with had only made him miss her more. How what she had done could never matter since he knew he could not cure himself of loving her. He wrote this letter at the Club, cold sober, and mailed it to New York asking her to write him at the office in Paris. That seemed safe. And that night missing her so much it made him feel hollow sick inside, he wandered up past Maxim's, picked a girl up and took her out to supper. He had gone to a place to dance with her afterward, she danced badly, and left her for a hot Armenian slut, that swung her belly against him so it almost scalded. He took her away from a British gunner subaltern after a row. The gunner asked him outside and they fought in the street on the cobbles in the dark. He'd hit him twice, hard, on the side of the jaw and when he didn't go down he knew he was in for a fight. The gunner hit him in the body, then beside his eye. He swung with his left again and landed and the gunner fell on him and grabbed his coat and tore the sleeve off and he clubbed him twice behind the ear and then smashed him with his right as he pushed him away. When the gunner went down his head hit first and he ran with the girl because they heard the M.P.'s coming. They got into a taxi and drove out to Rimmily Hissa along the Bosphorus, and around, and back in the cool night and went to bed and she felt as over-ripe as she looked but smooth, rose-petal, syrupy, smooth-bellied, big-breasted and needed no pillow under her buttocks, and he left her before she was awake looking blousy enough in the first daylight and turned up at the Pera Palace with a black eye, carrying his coat because one sleeve was missing.

That same night he left for Anatolia and he remembered, later on that trip, riding all day through fields of the poppies that they raised for opium and how strange it made you feel, finally, and all the distances seemed wrong, to where they had made the attack with the newly arrived Constantine officers, that did not know a god-damned thing, and the artillery had fired into the troops and the British observer had cried like a child.

That was the day he'd first seen dead men wearing white ballet skirts and upturned shoes with pompons on them. The Turks had come steadily and lumpily and he had seen the skirted men running and the officers shooting into them and running then themselves and he and the British observer had run too until his lungs ached and his mouth was full of the taste of pennies and they stopped behind some rocks and there were the Turks coming as lumpily as ever. Later he had seen the things that he could never think of and later still he had seen much worse. So when he got back to Paris that time he could not talk about it or stand to have it mentioned. And there in the café as he passed was that American poet with a pile of saucers in front of him and a stupid look on his potato face talking about the Dada movement with a Roumanian who said his name was Tristan Tzara, who always wore a monocle and had a headache, and, back at the apartment with his wife that now he loved again, the quarrel all over, the madness all over, glad to be home, the office sent his mail up to the flat. So then the letter in answer to the one he'd written came in on a platter one morning and when he saw the handwriting he went cold all over and tried to slip the letter underneath another. But his wife said,“Who is that letter from, dear?”and that was the end of the beginning of that.

He remembered the good times with them all, and the quarrels. They always picked the finest places to have the quarrels. And why had they always quarrelled when he was feeling best? He had never written any of that because, at first, he never wanted to hurt any one and then it seemed as though there was enough to write without it. But he had always thought that he would write it finally. There was so much to write. He had seen the world change; not just the events; although he had seen many of them and had watched the people, but he had seen the subtler change and he could remember how the people were at different times. He had been in it and he had watched it and it was his duty to write of it; but now he never would.

“How do you feel?”she said. She had come out from the tent now after her bath.

“All right.”

“Could you eat now?”He saw Molo behind her with the folding table and the other boy with the dishes.

I want to write,”he said.

“You ought to take some broth to keep your strength up.”

“I'm going to die tonight,”he said.“I don't need my strength up.”

“Don't be melodramatic, Harry, please,”she said.

“Why don't you use your nose? I'm rotted half way up my thigh now. What the hell should I fool with broth for? Molo bring whiskey-soda.”

“Please take the broth,”she said gently.

“All right.”

The broth was too hot. He had to hold it in the cup until it cooled enough to take it and then he just got it down without gagging.

“You're a fine woman,”he said.“Don't pay any attention to me.”

She looked at him with her well-known, well-loved face from Spur and Town & Country, only a little the worse for drink, only a little the worse for bed, but Town & Country never showed those good breasts and those useful thighs and those lightly small-of-back-caressing hands, and as he looked and saw her well-known pleasant smile, he felt death come again. This time there was no rush. It was a puff, as of a wind that makes a candle flicker and the flame go tall.

“They can bring my net out later and hang it from the tree and build the fire up. I'm not going in the tent tonight. It's not worth moving. It's a clear night. There won't be any rain.”

So this was how you died, in whispers that you did not hear. Well, there would be no more quarrelling. He could promise that. The one experience that he had never had he was not going to spoil now. He probably would. You spoiled everything. But perhaps he wouldn't.

“You can't take dictation, can you?”

“I never learned,”she told him.

“That's all right.”

There wasn't time, of course, although it seemed as though it telescoped so that you might put it all into one paragraph if you could get it right.

There was a log house, chinked white with mortar, on a hill above the lake. There was a bell on a pole by the door to call the people in to meals. Behind the house were fields and behind the fields was the timber. A line of lombardy poplars ran from the house to the dock. Other poplars ran along the point. A road went up to the hills along the edge of the timber and along that road he picked blackberries. Then that log house was burned down and all the guns that had been on deer foot racks above the open fire place were burned and afterwards their barrels, with the lead melted in the magazines, and the stocks burned away, lay out on the heap of ashes that were used to make lye for the big iron soap kettles, and you asked Grandfather if you could have them to play with, and he said, no. You see they were his guns still and he never bought any others. Nor did he hunt any more. The house was rebuilt in the same place out of lumber now and painted white and from its porch you saw the poplars and the lake beyond; but there were never any more guns. The barrels of the guns that had hung on the deer feet on the wall of the log house lay out there on the heap of ashes and no one ever touched them.

In the Black Forest, after the war, we rented a trout stream and there were two ways to walk to it. One was down the valley from Triberg and around the valley road in the shade of the trees that bordered the white road, and then up a side road that went up through the hills past many small farms, with the big Schwarzwald houses, until that road crossed the stream. That was where our fishing began.

The other way was to climb steeply up to the edge of the woods and then go across the top of the hills through the pine woods, and then out to the edge of a meadow and down across this meadow to the bridge. There were birches along the stream and it was not big, but narrow, clear and fast, with pools where it had cut under the roots of the birches. At the Hotel in Triberg the proprietor had a fine season. It was very pleasant and we were all great friends. The next year came the inflation and the money he had made the year before was not enough to buy supplies to open the hotel and he hanged himself.

You could dictate that, but you could not dictate the Place Contrescarpe where the flower sellers dyed their flowers in the street and the dye ran over the paving where the autobus started and the old men and the women, always drunk on wine and bad marc; and the children with their noses running in the cold; the smell of dirty sweat and poverty and drunkenness at the Café des Amateurs and the whores at the Bal Musette they lived above. The concierge who entertained the trooper of the Garde Republicaine in her loge, his horse-hair-plumed helmet on a chair. The locataire across the hall whose husband was a bicycle racer and her joy that morning at the crémerie when she had opened L'Auto and seen where he placed third in Paris-Tours, his first big race. She had blushed and laughed and then gone upstairs crying with the yellow sporting paper in her hand. The husband of the woman who ran the Bal Musette drove a taxi and when he, Harry, had to take an early plane the husband knocked upon the door to wake him and they each drank a glass of white wine at the zinc of the bar before they started. He knew his neighbors in that quarter then because they all were poor.

Around that Place there were two kinds; the drunkards and the sportifs. The drunkards killed their poverty that way; the sportifs took it out in exercise. They were the descendants of the Communards and it was no struggle for them to know their politics. They knew who had shot their fathers, their relatives, their brothers, and their friends when the Versailles troops came in and took the town after the Commune and executed any one they could catch with calloused hands, or who wore a cap, or carried any other sign he was a working man. And in that poverty, and in that quarter across the street from a Boucherie Chevaline and a wine cooperative he had written the start of all he was to do. There never was another part of Paris that he loved like that, the sprawling trees, the old white plastered houses painted brown below, the long green of the autobus in that round square, the purple flower dye upon the paving, the sudden drop down the hill of the rue Cardinal Lemoine to the River, and the other way the narrow crowded world of the rue Mouffetard. The street that ran up toward the Pantheon and the other that he always took with the bicycle, the only asphalted street in all that quarter, smooth under the tires, with the high narrow houses and the cheap tall hotel where Paul Verlaine had died. There were only two rooms in the apartments where they lived and he had a room on the top floor of that hotel that cost him sixty francs a month where he did his writing, and from it he could see the roofs and chimney pots and all the hills of Paris.

From the apartment you could only see the wood and coal man's place. He sold wine too, bad wine. The golden horse's head outside the Boucherie Chevaline where the carcasses hung yellow gold and red in the open window, and the green painted co-operative where they bought their wine; good wine and cheap. The rest was plaster walls and the windows of the neighbors. The neighbors who, at night, when some one lay drunk in the street, moaning and groaning in that typical French ivresse that you were propaganded to believe did not exist, would open their windows and then the murmur of talk.

“Where is the policeman? When you don't want him the bugger is always there. He's sleeping with some concierge. Get the Agent.”Till some one threw a bucket of water from a window and the moaning stopped.“What's that? Water. Ah, that's intelligent.”And the windows shutting. Marie, his femme de ménage, protesting against the eight-hour day saying,“If a husband works until six he gets only a little drunk on the way home and does not waste too much. If he works only until five he is drunk every night and one has no money. It is the wife of the working man who suffers from this shortening of hours.”

“Wouldn't you like some more broth?”the woman asked him now.

“No, thank you very much. It is awfully good.”

“Try just a little.”

“I would like a whiskey-soda.”

“It's not good for you.”

“No. It's bad for me. Cole Porter wrote the words and the music. This knowledge that you're going mad for me.”

“You know I like you to drink.”

“Oh yes. Only it's bad for me.”

When she goes, he thought, I'll have all I want. Not all I want but all there is. Ayee he was tired. Too tired. He was going to sleep a little while. He lay still and death was not there. It must have gone around another street. It went in pairs, on bicycles, and moved absolutely silently on the pavements.

No, he had never written about Paris. Not the Paris that he cared about. But what about the rest that he had never written?

What about the ranch and the silvered gray of the sage brush, the quick, clear water in the irrigation ditches, and the heavy green of the alfalfa. The trail went up into the hills and the cattle in the summer were shy as deer. The bawling and the steady noise and slow moving mass raising a dust as you brought them down in the fall. And behind the mountains, the clear sharpness of the peak in the evening light and, riding down along the trail in the moonlight, bright across the valley. Now he remembered coming down through the timber in the dark holding the horse's tail when you could not see and all the stories that he meant to write.

About the half-wit chore boy who was left at the ranch that time and told not to let any one get any hay, and that old bastard from the Forks who had beaten the boy when he had worked for him stopping to get some feed. The boy refusing and the old man saying he would beat him again. The boy got the rifle from the kitchen and shot him when he tried to come into the barn and when they came back to the ranch he'd been dead a week, frozen in the corral, and the dogs had eaten part of him. But what was left you packed on a sled wrapped in a blanket and roped on and you got the boy to help you haul it, and the two of you took it out over the road on skis, and sixty miles down to town to turn the boy over. He having no idea that he would be arrested. Thinking he had done his duty and that you were his friend and he would be rewarded. He'd helped to haul the old man in so everybody could know how bad the old man had been and how he'd tried to steal some feed that didn't belong to him, and when the sheriff put the handcuffs on the boy he couldn't believe it. Then he'd started to cry. That was one story he had saved to write. He knew at least twenty good stories from out there and he had never written one. Why?

“You tell them why,”he said.

“Why what, dear?”

“Why nothing.”

She didn't drink so much, now, since she had him. But if he lived he would never write about her, he knew that now. Nor about any of them. The rich were dull and they drank too much, or they played too much backgammon. They were dull and they were repetitious. He remembered poor Julian and his romantic awe of them and how he had started a story once that began,“The very rich are different from you and me.”And how some one had said to Julian, Yes, they have more money. But that was not humorous to Julian. He thought they were a special glamourous race and when he found they weren't it wrecked him just as much as any other thing that wrecked him.

He had been contemptuous of those who wrecked. You did not have to like it because you understood it. He could beat anything, he thought, because no thing could hurt him if he did not care.

All right. Now he would not care for death. One thing he had always dreaded was the pain. He could stand pain as well as any man, until it went on too long, and wore him out, but here he had something that had hurt frightfully and just when he had felt it breaking him, the pain had stopped.

He remembered long ago when Williamson, the bombing officer, had been hit by a stick bomb some one in a German patrol had thrown as he was coming in through the wire that night and, screaming, had begged every one to kill him. He was a fat man, very brave, and a good officer, although addicted to fantastic shows. But that night he was caught in the wire, with a flare lighting him up and his bowels spilled out into the wire, so when they brought him in, alive, they had to cut him loose. Shoot me, Harry. For Christ sake shoot me. They had had an argument one time about our Lord never sending you anything you could not bear and some one's theory had been that meant that at a certain time the pain passed you out automatically. But he had always remembered Williamson, that night. Nothing passed out Williamson until he gave him all his morphine tablets that he had always saved to use himself and then they did not work right away.

Still this now, that he had, was very easy; and if it was no worse as it went on there was nothing to worry about. Except that he would rather be in better company.

He thought a little about the company that he would like to have.

No, he thought, when everything you do, you do too long, and do too late, you can't expect to find the people still there. The people all are gone. The party's over and you are with your hostess now.

I'm getting as bored with dying as with everything else, he thought.

“It's a bore,”he said out loud.

“What is, my dear?”

“Anything you do too bloody long.”

He looked at her face between him and the fire. She was leaning back in the chair and the firelight shone on her pleasantly lined face and he could see that she was sleepy. He heard the hyena make a noise just >outside the range of the fire.

“I've been writing,”he said.“But I got tired.”

“Do you think you will be able to sleep?”

“Pretty sure. Why don't you turn in?”

“I like to sit here with you.”

“Do you feel anything strange?”he asked her.

“No. Just a little sleepy.”

“I do,”he said.

He had just felt death come by again.

“You know the only thing I've never lost is curiosity,”he said to her.

“You've never lost anything. You're the most complete man I've ever known.”

“Christ,”he said.“How little a woman knows. What is that? Your intuition?”

Because, just then, death had come and rested its head on the foot of the cot and he could smell its breath.

“Never believe any of that about a scythe and a skull,”he told her.“It can be two bicycle policemen as easily, or be a bird. Or it can have a wide snout like a hyena.”

It had moved up on him now, but it had no shape any more. It simply occupied space.

“Tell it to go away.”

It did not go away but moved a little closer.

“You've got a hell of a breath,”he told it.“You stinking bastard.”

It moved up closer to him still and now he could not speak to it, and when it saw he could not speak it came a little closer, and now he tried to send it away without speaking, but it moved in on him so its weight was all upon his chest, and while it crouched there and he could not move, or speak, he heard the woman say,“Bwana is asleep now. Take the cot up very gently and carry it into the tent.”

He could not speak to tell her to make it go away and it crouched now, heavier, so he could not breathe. And then, while they lifted the cot, suddenly it was all right and the weight went from his chest.




It was morning and had been morning for some time and he heard the plane. It showed very tiny and then made a wide circle and the boys ran out and lit the fires, using kerosene, and piled on grass so there were two big smudges at each end of the level place and the morning breeze blew them toward the camp and the plane circled twice more, low this time, and then glided down and levelled off and landed smoothly and, coming walking toward him, was old Compton in slacks, a tweed jacket and a brown felt hat.

“What's the matter, old cock?”Compton said.

“Bad leg,”he told him.“Will you have some breakfast?”

“Thanks. I'll just have some tea. It's the Puss Moth you know. I won't be able to take the Memsahib. There's only room for one. Your lorry is on the way.”

Helen had taken Compton aside and was speaking to him. Compton came back more cheery than ever.

“We'll get you right in,”he said.“I'll be back for the Mem. Now I'm afraid I'll have to stop at Arusha to refuel. We'd better get going.”

“What about the tea?”

“I don't really care about it, you know.”

The boys had picked up the cot and carried it around the green tents and down along the rock and out onto the plain and along past the smudges that were burning brightly now, the grass all consumed, and the wind fanning the fire, to the little plane. It was difficult getting him in, but once in he lay back in the leather seat, and the leg was stuck straight out to one side of the seat where Compton sat. Compton started the motor and got in. He waved to Helen and to the boys and, as the clatter moved into the old familiar roar, they swung around with Compie watching for warthog holes and roared, bumping, along the stretch between the fires and with the last bump rose and he saw them all standing below, waving, and the camp beside the hill, flattening now, and the plain spreading, clumps of trees, and the bush flattening, while the game trails ran now smoothly to the dry waterholes, and there was a new water that he had never known of. The zebra, small rounded backs now, and the wildebeeste, big-headed dots seeming to climb as they moved in long fingers across the plain, now scattering as the shadow came toward them, they were tiny now, and the movement had no gallop, and the plain as far as you could see, gray-yellow now and ahead old Compie's tweed back and the brown felt hat. Then they were over the first hills and the wildebeeste were trailing up them, and then they were over mountains with sudden depths of green-rising forest and the solid bamboo slopes, and then the heavy forest again, sculptured into peaks and hollows until they crossed, and hills sloped down and then another plain, hot now, and purple brown, bumpy with heat and Compie looking back to see how he was riding. Then there were other mountains dark ahead.

And then instead of going on to Arusha they turned left, he evidently figured that they had the gas, and looking down he saw a pink sifting cloud, moving over the ground, and in the air, like the first snow in a blizzard, that comes from nowhere, and he knew the locusts were coming up from the South. Then they began to climb and they were going to the East it seemed, and then it darkened and they were in a storm, the rain so thick it seemed like flying through a waterfall, and then they were out and Compie turned his head and grinned and pointed and there, ahead, all he could see, as wide as all the world, great, high, and unbelievably white in the sun, was the square top of Kilimanjaro. And then he knew that there was where he was going.




Just then the hyena stopped whimpering in the night and started to make a strange, human, almost crying sound. The woman heard it and stirred uneasily. She did not wake. In her dream she was at the house on Long Island and it was the night before her daughter's début. Somehow her father was there and he had been very rude. Then the noise the hyena made was so loud she woke and for a moment she did not know where she was and she was very afraid. Then she took the flashlight and shone it on the other cot that they had carried in after Harry had gone to sleep. She could see his bulk under the mosquito bar but somehow he had gotten his leg out and it hung down alongside the cot. The dressings had all come down and she could not look at it.

“Molo,”she called,“Molo! Molo!”

Then she said,“Harry, Harry!”Then her voice rising,“Harry! Please. Oh Harry!”

There was no answer and she could not hear him breathing.

Outside the tent the hyena made the same strange noise that had awakened her. But she did not hear him for the beating of her heart.





Old Man at the Bridge


An old man with steel rimmed spectacles and very dusty clothes sat by the side of the road. There was a pontoon bridge across the river and carts, trucks, and men, women and children were crossing it. The mule-drawn carts staggered up the steep bank from the bridge with soldiers helping push against the spokes of the wheels. The trucks ground up and away heading out of it all and the peasants plodded along in the ankle deep dust. But the old man sat there without moving. He was too tired to go any farther.

It was my business to cross the bridge, explore the bridgehead beyond and find out to what point the enemy had advanced. I did this and returned over the bridge. There were not so many carts now and very few people on foot, but the old man was still there.

“Where do you come from?”I asked him.

“From San Carlos,”he said, and smiled.

That was his native town and so it gave him pleasure to mention it and he smiled.

“I was taking care of animals,”he explained.

“Oh,”I said, not quite understanding.

“Yes,”he said,“I stayed, you see, taking care of animals. I was the last one to leave the town of San Carlos.”

He did not look like a shepherd nor a herdsman and I looked at his black dusty clothes and his gray dusty face and his steel rimmed spectacles and said,“What animals were they?”

“Various animals,”he said, and shook his head.“I had to leave them.”

I was watching the bridge and the African looking country of the Ebro Delta and wondering how long now it would be before we would see the enemy, and listening all the while for the first noises that would signal that ever mysterious event called contact, and the old man still sat there.

“What animals were they?”I asked.

“There were three animals altogether,”he explained.“There were two goats and a cat and then there were four pairs of pigeons.”

“And you had to leave them?”I asked.

“Yes. Because of the artillery. The captain told me to go because of the artillery.”

“And you have no family?”I asked, watching the far end of the bridge where a few last carts were hurrying down the slope of the bank.

“No,”he said,“only the animals I stated. The cat, of course, will be all right. A cat can look out for itself, but I cannot think what will become of the others.”

“What politics have you?”I asked.

“I am without politics,”he said.“I am seventy-six years old. I have come twelve kilometers now and I think now I can go no further.”

“This is not a good place to stop,”I said.“If you can make it, there are trucks up the road where it forks for Tortosa.”

“I will wait a while,”he said,“and then I will go. Where do the trucks go?”

“Towards Barcelona,”I told him.

“I know no one in that direction,”he said,“but thank you very much. Thank you again very much.”

He looked at me very blankly and tiredly, then said, having to share his worry with some one,“The cat will be all right, I am sure. There is no need to be unquiet about the cat. But the others. Now what do you think about the others?”

“Why they'll probably come through it all right.”

“You think so?”

“Why not,”I said, watching the far bank where now there were no carts.

“But what will they do under the artillery when I was told to leave because of the artillery?”

“Did you leave the dove cage unlocked?”I asked.

“Yes.”

“Then they'll fly.”

“Yes, certainly they'll fly. But the others. It's better not to think about the others,”he said.

“If you are rested I would go,”I urged.“Get up and try to walk now.”

“Thank you,”he said and got to his feet, swayed from side to side and then sat down backwards in the dust.

“I was taking care of animals,”he said dully, but no longer to me.“I was only taking care of animals.”

There was nothing to do about him. It was Easter Sunday and the Fascists were advancing toward the Ebro. It was a gray overcast day with a low ceiling so their planes were not up. That and the fact that cats know how to look after themselves was all the good luck that old man would ever have.





Up in Michigan


Jim gilmore came to Hortons Bay from Canada. He bought the blacksmith shop from old man Horton. Jim was short and dark with big mustaches and big hands. He was a good horseshoer and did not look much like a blacksmith even with his leather apron on. He lived upstairs above the blacksmith shop and took his meals at D. J. Smith's.

Liz Coates worked for Smith's. Mrs. Smith, who was a very large clean woman, said Liz Coates was the neatest girl she'd ever seen. Liz had good legs and always wore clean gingham aprons and Jim noticed that her hair was always neat behind. He liked her face because it was so jolly but he never thought about her.

Liz liked Jim very much. She liked it the way he walked over from the shop and often went to the kitchen door to watch for him to start down the road. She liked it about his mustache. She liked it about how white his teeth were when he smiled. She liked it very much that he didn't look like a blacksmith. She liked it how much D. J. Smith and Mrs. Smith liked Jim. One day she found that she liked it the way the hair was black on his arms and how white they were above the tanned line when he washed up in the washbasin outside the house. Liking that made her feel funny.

Hortons Bay, the town, was only five houses on the main road between Boyne City and Charlevoix. There was the general store and post office with a high false front and maybe a wagon hitched out in front, Smith's house, Stroud's house, Dillworth's house, Horton's house and Van Hoosen's house. The houses were in a big grove of elm trees and the road was very sandy. There was farming country and timber each way up the road. Up the road a ways was the Methodist church and down the road the other direction was the township school. The blacksmith shop was painted red and faced the school.

A steep sandy road ran down the hill to the bay through the timber. From Smith's back door you could look out across the woods that ran down to the lake and across the bay. It was very beautiful in the spring and summer, the bay blue and bright and usually whitecaps on the lake out beyond the point from the breeze blowing from Charlevoix and Lake Michigan. From Smith's back door Liz could see ore barges way out in the lake going toward Boyne City. When she looked at them they didn't seem to be moving at all but if she went in and dried some more dishes and then came out again they would be out of sight beyond the point.

All the time now Liz was thinking about Jim Gilmore. He didn't seem to notice her much. He talked about the shop to D. J. Smith and about the Republican Party and about James G. Blaine. In the evenings he read The Toledo Blade and the Grand Rapids paper by the lamp in the front room or went out spearing fish in the bay with a jacklight with D. J. Smith. In the fall he and Smith and Charley Wyman took a wagon and tent, grub, axes, their rifles and two dogs and went on a trip to the pine plains beyond Vanderbilt deer hunting. Liz and Mrs. Smith were cooking for four days for them before they started. Liz wanted to make something special for Jim to take but she didn't finally because she was afraid to ask Mrs. Smith for the eggs and flour and afraid if she bought them Mrs. Smith would catch her cooking. It would have been all right with Mrs. Smith but Liz was afraid.

All the time Jim was gone on the deer hunting trip Liz thought about him. It was awful while he was gone. She couldn't sleep well from thinking about him but she discovered it was fun to think about him too. If she let herself go it was better. The night before they were to come back she didn't sleep at all, that is she didn't think she slept because it was all mixed up in a dream about not sleeping and really not sleeping. When she saw the wagon coming down the road she felt weak and sick sort of inside. She couldn't wait till she saw Jim and it seemed as though everything would be all right when he came. The wagon stopped outside under the big elm and Mrs. Smith and Liz went out. All the men had beards and there were three deer in the back of the wagon, their thin legs sticking stiff over the edge of the wagon box. Mrs. Smith kissed D. J. and he hugged her. Jim said“Hello, Liz,”and grinned. Liz hadn't known just what would happen when Jim got back but she was sure it would be something. Nothing had happened. The men were just home, that was all. Jim pulled the burlap sacks off the deer and Liz looked at them. One was a big buck. It was stiff and hard to lift out of the wagon.

“Did you shoot it, Jim?”Liz asked.

“Yeah. Ain't it a beauty?”Jim got it onto his back to carry to the smokehouse.

That night Charley Wyman stayed to supper at Smith's. It was too late to get back to Charlevoix. The men washed up and waited in the front room for supper.

“Ain't there something left in that crock, Jimmy?”D. J. Smith asked, and Jim went out to the wagon in the barn and fetched in the jug of whiskey the men had taken hunting with them. It was a four-gallon jug and there was quite a little slopped back and forth in the bottom. Jim took a long pull on his way back to the house. It was hard to lift such a big jug up to drink out of it. Some of the whiskey ran down on his shirt front. The two men smiled when Jim came in with the jug. D. J. Smith sent for glasses and Liz brought them. D. J. poured out three big shots.

“Well, here's looking at you, D. J.,”said Charley Wyman.

“That damn big buck, Jimmy,”said D. J.

“Here's all the ones we missed, D. J.,”said Jim, and downed his liquor.

“Tastes good to a man.”

“Nothing like it this time of year for what ails you.”

“How about another, boys?”

“Here's how, D. J.”

“Down the creek, boys.”

“Here's to next year.”

Jim began to feel great. He loved the taste and the feel of whiskey. He was glad to be back to a comfortable bed and warm food and the shop. He had another drink. The men came in to supper feeling hilarious but acting very respectable. Liz sat at the table after she put on the food and ate with the family. It was a good dinner. The men ate seriously. After supper they went into the front room again and Liz cleaned off with Mrs. Smith. Then Mrs. Smith went upstairs and pretty soon Smith came out and went upstairs too. Jim and Charley were still in the front room. Liz was sitting in the kitchen next to the stove pretending to read a book and thinking about Jim. She didn't want to go to bed yet because she knew Jim would be coming out and she wanted to see him as he went out so she could take the way he looked up to bed with her.

She was thinking about him hard and then Jim came out. His eyes were shining and his hair was a little rumpled. Liz looked down at her book. Jim came over back of her chair and stood there and she could feel him breathing and then he put his arms around her. Her breasts felt plump and firm and the nipples were erect under his hands. Liz was terribly frightened, no one had ever touched her, but she thought,“He's come to me finally. He's really come.”

She held herself stiff because she was so frightened and did not know anything else to do and then Jim held her tight against the chair and kissed her. It was such a sharp, aching, hurting feeling that she thought she couldn't stand it. She felt Jim right through the back of the chair and she couldn't stand it and then something clicked inside of her and the feeling was warmer and softer. Jim held her tight hard against the chair and she wanted it now and Jim whispered,“Come on for a walk.”

Liz took her coat off the peg on the kitchen wall and they went out the door. Jim had his arm around her and every little way they stopped and pressed against each other and Jim kissed her. There was no moon and they walked ankle-deep in the sandy road through the trees down to the dock and the warehouse on the bay. The water was lapping in the piles and the point was dark across the bay. It was cold but Liz was hot all over from being with Jim. They sat down in the shelter of the warehouse and Jim pulled Liz close to him. She was frightened. One of Jim's hands went inside her dress and stroked over her breast and the other hand was in her lap. She was very frightened and didn't know how he was going to go about things but she snuggled close to him. Then the hand that felt so big in her lap went away and was on her leg and started to move up it.

“Don't, Jim,”Liz said. Jim slid the hand further up.

“You mustn't, Jim. You mustn't.”Neither Jim nor Jim's big hand paid any attention to her.

The boards were hard. Jim had her dress up and was trying to do something to her. She was frightened but she wanted it. She had to have it but it frightened her.

“You mustn't do it, Jim. You mustn't.”

“I got to. I'm going to. You know we got to.”

“No we haven't, Jim. We ain't got to. Oh, it isn't right. Oh, it's so big and it hurts so. You can't. Oh, Jim. Jim. Oh.”

The hemlock planks of the dock were hard and splintery and cold and Jim was heavy on her and he had hurt her. Liz pushed him, she was so uncomfortable and cramped. Jim was asleep. He wouldn't move. She worked out from under him and sat up and straightened her skirt and coat and tried to do something with her hair. Jim was sleeping with his mouth a little open. Liz leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. He was still asleep. She lifted his head a little and shook it. He rolled his head over and swallowed. Liz started to cry. She walked over to the edge of the dock and looked down to the water. There was a mist coming up from the bay. She was cold and miserable and everything felt gone. She walked back to where Jim was lying and shook him once more to make sure. She was crying.

“Jim,”she said,“Jim. Please, Jim.”

Jim stirred and curled a little tighter. Liz took off her coat and leaned over and covered him with it. She tucked it around him neatly and carefully. Then she walked across the dock and up the steep sandy road to go to bed. A cold mist was coming up through the woods from the bay.





Indian Camp


At the lake shore there was an other rowboat drawn up. The two Indians stood waiting.

Nick and his father got in the stern of the boat and the Indians shoved it off and one of them got in to row. Uncle George sat in the stern of the camp rowboat. The young Indian shoved the camp boat off and got in to row Uncle George.

The two boats started off in the dark. Nick heard the oarlocks of the other boat quite a way ahead of them in the mist. The Indians rowed with quick choppy strokes. Nick lay back with his father's arm around him. It was cold on the water. The Indian who was rowing them was working very hard, but the other boat moved further ahead in the mist all the time.

“Where are we going, Dad?”Nick asked.

“Over to the Indian camp. There is an Indian lady very sick.”

“Oh,”said Nick.

Across the bay they found the other boat beached. Uncle George was smoking a cigar in the dark. The young Indian pulled the boat way up on the beach. Uncle George gave both the Indians cigars.

They walked up from the beach through a meadow that was soaking wet with dew, following the young Indian who carried a lantern. Then they went into the woods and followed a trail that led to the logging road that ran back into the hills. It was much lighter on the logging road as the timber was cut away on both sides. The young Indian stopped and blew out his lantern and they all walked on along the road.

They came around a bend and a dog came out barking. Ahead were the lights of the shanties where the Indian bark-peelers lived. More dogs rushed out at them. The two Indians sent them back to the shanties. In the shanty nearest the road there was a light in the window. An old woman stood in the doorway holding a lamp.

Inside on a wooden bunk lay a young Indian woman. She had been trying to have her baby for two days. All the old women in the camp had been helping her. The men had moved off up the road to sit in the dark and smoke out of range of the noise she made. She screamed just as Nick and the two Indians followed his father and Uncle George into the shanty. She lay in the lower bunk, very big under a quilt. Her head was turned to one side. In the upper bunk was her husband. He had cut his foot very badly with an ax three days before. He was smoking a pipe. The room smelled very bad.

Nick's father ordered some water to be put on the stove, and while it was heating he spoke to Nick.

“This lady is going to have a baby, Nick,”he said.

“I know,”said Nick.

“You don't know,”said his father.“Listen to me. What she is going through is called being in labor. The baby wants to be born and she wants it to be born. All her muscles are trying to get the baby born. That is what is happening when she screams.”

“I see,”Nick said.

Just then the woman cried out.

“Oh, Daddy, can't you give her something to make her stop screaming?”asked Nick.

“No. I haven't any anaesthetic,”his father said.“But her screams are not important. I don't hear them because they are not important.”

The husband in the upper bunk rolled over against the wall.

The woman in the kitchen motioned to the doctor that the water was hot. Nick's father went into the kitchen and poured about half of the water out of the big kettle into a basin. Into the water left in the kettle he put several things he unwrapped from a handkerchief.

“Those must boil,”he said, and began to scrub his hands in the basin of hot water with a cake of soap he had brought from the camp. Nick watched his father's hands scrubbing each other with the soap. While his father washed his hands very carefully and thoroughly, he talked.

“You see, Nick, babies are supposed to be born head first but sometimes they're not. When they're not they make a lot of trouble for everybody. Maybe I'll have to operate on this lady. We'll know in a little while.”

When he was satisfied with his hands he went in and went to work.

“Pull back that quilt, will you, George?”he said.“I'd rather not touch it.”

Later when he started to operate Uncle George and three Indian men held the woman still. She bit Uncle George on the arm and Uncle George said,“Damn squaw bitch!”and the young Indian who had rowed Uncle George over laughed at him. Nick held the basin for his father. It all took a long time. His father picked the baby up and slapped it to make it breathe and handed it to the old woman.

“See, it's a boy, Nick,”he said.“How do you like being an interne?”

Nick said,“All right.”He was looking away so as not to see what his father was doing.

“There. That gets it,”said his father and put something into the basin.

Nick didn't look at it.

“Now,”his father said,“there's some stitches to put in. You can watch this or not, Nick, just as you like. I'm going to sew up the incision I made.”

Nick did not watch. His curiosity had been gone for a long time.

His father finished and stood up. Uncle George and the three Indian men stood up. Nick put the basin out in the kitchen.

Uncle George looked at his arm. The young Indian smiled remini-scently.

“I'll put some peroxide on that, George,”the doctor said. He bent over the Indian woman. She was quiet now and her eyes were closed. She looked very pale. She did not know what had become of the baby or anything.

“I'll be back in the morning,”the doctor said, standing up.“The nurse should be here from St. Ignace by noon and she'll bring everything we need.”

He was feeling exalted and talkative as football players are in the dressing room after a game.

“That's one for the medical journal, George,”he said.“Doing a Caesarian with a jack-knife and sewing it up with nine-foot, tapered gut leaders.”

Uncle George was standing against the wall, looking at his arm.

“Oh, you're a great man, all right,”he said.

“Ought to have a look at the proud father. They're usually the worst sufferers in these little affairs,”the doctor said.“I must say he took it all pretty quietly.”

He pulled back the blanket from the Indian's head. His hand came away wet. He mounted on the edge of the lower bunk with the lamp in one hand and looked in. The Indian lay with his face toward the wall. His throat had been cut from ear to ear. The blood had flowed down into a pool where his body sagged the bunk. His head rested on his left arm. The open razor lay, edge up, in the blankets.

“Take Nick out of the shanty, George,”the doctor said.

There was no need of that. Nick, standing in the door of the kitchen, had a good view of the upper bunk when his father, the lamp in one hand, tipped the Indian's head back.

It was just beginning to be daylight when they walked along the logging road back toward the lake.

“I'm terribly sorry I brought you along, Nickie,”said his father, all his post-operative exhilaration gone.“It was an awful mess to put you through.”

“Do ladies always have such a hard time having babies?”Nick asked.

“No, that was very, very exceptional.”

“Why did he kill himself, Daddy?”

“I don't know, Nick. He couldn't stand things, I guess.”

“Do many men kill themselves, Daddy?”

“Not very many, Nick.”

“Do many women?”

“Hardly ever.”

“Don't they ever?”

“Oh, yes. They do sometimes.”

“Daddy?”

“Yes.”

“Where did Uncle George go?”

“He'll turn up all right.”

“Is dying hard, Daddy?”

“No, I think it's pretty easy, Nick. It all depends.”

They were seated in the boat, Nick in the stern, his father rowing. The sun was coming up over the hills. A bass jumped, making a circle in the water. Nick trailed his hand in the water. It felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning.

In the early morning on the lake sitting in the stern of the boat with his father rowing, he felt quite sure that he would never die.





The Three-Day Blow


The rain stopped as Nick turned into the road that went up through the orchard. The fruit had been picked and the fall wind blew through the bare trees. Nick stopped and picked up a Wagner apple from beside the road, shiny in the brown grass from the rain. He put the apple in the pocket of his Mackinaw coat.

The road came out of the orchard on to the top of the hill. There was the cottage, the porch bare, smoke coming from the chimney. In back was the garage, the chicken coop and the second-growth timber like a hedge against the woods behind. The big trees swayed far over in the wind as he watched. It was the first of the autumn storms.

As Nick crossed the open field above the orchard the door of the cottage opened and Bill came out. He stood on the porch looking out.

“Well, Wemedge,”he said.

“Hey, Bill,”Nick said, coming up the steps.

They stood together, looking out across the country, down over the orchard, beyond the road, across the lower fields and the woods of the point to the lake. The wind was blowing straight down the lake. They could see the surf along Ten Mile point.

“She's blowing,”Nick said.

“She'll blow like that for three days,”Bill said.

“Is your dad in?”Nick said.

“No. He's out with the gun. Come on in.”

Nick went inside the cottage. There was a big fire in the fireplace. The wind made it roar. Bill shut the door.

“Have a drink?”he said.

He went out to the kitchen and came back with two glasses and a pitcher of water. Nick reached the whisky bottle from the shelf above the fireplace.

“All right?”he said.

“Good,”said Bill.

They sat in front of the fire and drank the Irish whisky and water.

“It's got a swell, smoky taste,”Nick said, and looked at the fire through the glass.

“That's the peat,”Bill said.

“You can't get peat into liquor,”Nick said.

“That doesn't make any difference,”Bill said.

“You ever seen any peat?”Nick asked.

“No,”said Bill.

“Neither have I,”Nick said.

His shoes, stretched out on the hearth, began to steam in front of the fire.

“Better take your shoes off,”Bill said.

“I haven't got any socks on.”

“Take them off and dry them and I'll get you some,”Bill said. He went upstairs into the loft and Nick heard him walking about overhead. Upstairs was open under the roof and was where Bill and his father and he, Nick, sometimes slept. In back was a dressing room. They moved the cots back out of the rain and covered them with rubber blankets.

Bill came down with a pair of heavy wool socks.

“It's getting too late to go around without socks,”he said.

“I hate to start them again,”Nick said. He pulled the socks on and slumped back in the chair, putting his feet up on the screen in front of the fire.

“You'll dent in the screen,”Bill said. Nick swung his feet over to the side of the fireplace.

“Got anything to read?”he asked.

“Only the paper.”

“What did the Cards do?”

“Dropped a double header to the Giants.”

“That ought to cinch it for them.”

“It's a gift,”Bill said.“As long as McGraw can buy every good ball player in the league there's nothing to it.”

“He can't buy them all,”Nick said.

“He buys all the ones he wants,”Bill said.“Or he makes them discontented so they have to trade them to him.”

“Like Heinie Zim,”Nick agreed.

“That bonehead will do him a lot of good.”

Bill stood up.

“He can hit,”Nick offered. The heat from the fire was baking his legs.

“He's a sweet fielder, too,”Bill said.“But he loses ball games.”

“Maybe that's what McGraw wants him for,”Nick suggested.

“Maybe,”Bill agreed.

“There's always more to it than we know about,”Nick said.

“Of course. But we've got pretty good dope for being so far away.”

“Like how much better you can pick them if you don't see the horses.”

“That's it.”

Bill reached down the whisky bottle. His big hand went all the way around it. He poured the whisky into the glass Nick held out.

“How much water?”

“Just the same.”

He sat down on the floor beside Nick's chair.

“It's good when the fall storms come, isn't it?”Nick said.

“It's swell.”

“It's the best time of year,”Nick said.

“Wouldn't it be hell to be in town?”Bill said.

“I'd like to see the World Series,”Nick said.

“Well, they're always in New York or Philadelphia now,”Bill said.“That doesn't do us any good.”

“I wonder if the Cards will ever win a pennant?”

“Not in our lifetime,”Bill said.

“Gee, they'd go crazy,”Nick said.

“Do you remember when they got going that once before they had the train wreck?”

“Boy!”Nick said, remembering.

Bill reached over to the table under the window for the book that lay there, face down, where he had put it when he went to the door. He held his glass in one hand and the book in the other, leaning back against Nick's chair.

“What are you reading?”

“Richard Feverel.”

“I couldn't get into it.”

“It's all right,”Bill said.“It ain't a bad book, Wemedge.”

“What else have you got I haven't read?”Nick asked.

“Did you read the Forest Lovers?”

“Yup. That's the one where they go to bed every night with the naked sword between them.”

“That's a good book, Wemedge.”

“It's a swell book. What I couldn't ever understand was what good the sword would do. It would have to stay edge up all the time because if it went over flat you could roll right over it and it wouldn't make any trouble.”

“It's a symbol,”Bill said.

“Sure”said Nick,“but it isn't practical.”

“Did you ever read Fortitude?”

“It's fine,”Nick said.“That's a real book. That's where his old man is after him all the time. Have you got any more by Walpole?”

“The Dark Forest,”Bill said.“It's about Russia.”

“What does he know about Russia?”Nick asked.

“I don't know. You can't ever tell about those guys. Maybe he was there when he was a boy. He's got a lot of dope on it.”

“I'd like to meet him,”Nick said.

“I'd like to meet Chesterton,”Bill said.

“I wish he was here now,”Nick said.“We'd take him fishing to the 'Voix tomorrow.”

“I wonder if he'd like to go fishing,”Bill said.

“Sure,”said Nick.“He must be about the best guy there is. Do you remember the Flying Inn?”

“‘If an angel out of heaven

Gives you something else to drink.

Thank him for his kind intentions;

Go and pour them down the sink.’”

“That's right,”said Nick.“I guess he's a better guy than Walpole.”

“Oh, he's a better guy, all right,”Bill said.

“But Walpole's a better writer.”

“I don't know,”Nick said.“Chesterton's a classic.”

“Walpole's a classic, too,”Bill insisted.

“I wish we had them both here,”Nick said.“We'd take them both fishing to the 'Voix tomorrow.”

“Let's get drunk,”Bill said.

“All right,”Nick agreed.

“My old man won't care,”Bill said.

“Are you sure?”said Nick.

“I know it,”Bill said.

“I'm a little drunk now,”Nick said.

“You aren't drunk,”Bill said.

He got up from the floor and reached for the whisky bottle. Nick held out his glass. His eyes fixed on it while Bill poured.

Bill poured the glass half full of whisky.

“Put in your own water,”he said.“There's just one more shot.”

“Got any more?”Nick asked.

“There's plenty more but dad only likes me to drink what's open.”

“Sure,”said Nick.

“He says opening bottles is what makes drunkards,”Bill explained.

“That's right,”said Nick. He was impressed. He had never thought of that before. He had always thought it was solitary drinking that made drunkards.

“How is your dad?”he asked respectfully.

“He's all right,”Bill said.“He gets a little wild sometimes.”

“He's a swell guy,”Nick said. He poured water into his glass out of the pitcher. It mixed slowly with the whisky. There was more whisky than water.

“You bet your life he is,”Bill said.

“My old man's all right,”Nick said.

“You're damn right he is,”said Bill.

“He claims he's never taken a drink in his life,”Nick said, as though announcing a scientific fact.

“Well, he's a doctor. My old man's a painter. That's different.”

“He's missed a lot,”Nick said sadly.

“You can't tell.”Bill said.“Everything's got its compensations.”

“He says he's missed a lot himself,”Nick confessed.

“Well, dad's had a tough time,”Bill said.

“It all evens up,”Nick said.

They sat looking into the fire and thinking of this profound truth.

“I'll get a chunk from the back porch,”Nick said. He had noticed while looking into the fire that the fire was dying down. Also he wished to show he could hold his liquor and be practical. Even if his father had never touched a drop Bill was not going to get him drunk before he himself was drunk.

“Bring one of the big beech chunks,”Bill said. He was also being consciously practical.

Nick came in with the log through the kitchen and in passing knocked a pan off the kitchen table. He laid the log down and picked up the pan. It had contained dried apricots, soaking in water. He carefully picked up all the apricots off the floor, some of them had gone under the stove, and put them back in the pan. He dipped some more water onto them from the pail by the table. He felt quite proud of himself. He had been thoroughly practical.

He came in carrying the log and Bill got up from the chair and helped him put it on the fire.

“That's a swell log,”Nick said.

“I'd been saving it for the bad weather,”Bill said.“A log like that will bum all night.”

“There'll be coals left to start the fire in the morning,”Nick said.

“That's right,”Bill agreed. They were conducting the conversation on a high plane.

“Let's have another drink,”Nick said.

“I think there's another bottle open in the locker,”Bill said.

He kneeled down in the corner in front of the locker and brought out a square-faced bottle.

“It's Scotch,”he said.

“I'll get some more water,”Nick said. He went out into the kitchen again. He filled the pitcher with the dipper dipping cold spring water from the pail. On his way back to the living room he passed a mirror in the dining room and looked in it. His face looked strange. He smiled at the face in the mirror and it grinned back at him. He winked at it and went on. It was not his face but it didn't make any difference.

Bill had poured out the drinks.

“That's an awfully big shot,”Nick said.

“Not for us, Wemedge,”Bill said.

“What'll we drink to?”Nick asked, holding up the glass.

“Let's drink to fishing,”Bill said.

“All right,”Nick said.“Gentlemen, I give you fishing.”

“All fishing,”Bill said.“Everywhere.”

“Fishing,”Nick said.“That's what we drink to.”

“It's better than baseball,”Bill said.

“There isn't any comparison,”said Nick.“How did we ever get talking about baseball?”

“It was a mistake,”Bill said.“Baseball is a game for louts.”

They drank all that was in their glasses.

“Now let's drink to Chesterton.”

“And Walpole,”Nick interposed.

Nick poured out the liquor. Bill poured in the water. They looked at each other. They felt very fine.

“Gentlemen,”Bill said,“I give you Chesterton and Walpole.”

“Exactly, gentlemen,”Nick said.

They drank. Bill filled up the glasses. They sat down in the big chairs in front of the fire.

“You were very wise, Wemedge,”Bill said.

“What do you mean?”asked Nick.

“To bust off that Marge business,”Bill said.

“I guess so,”said Nick.

“It was the only thing to do. If you hadn't, by now you'd be back home working trying to get enough money to get married.”

Nick said nothing.

“Once a man's married he's absolutely bitched,”Bill went on.“He hasn't got anything more. Nothing. Not a damn thing. He's done for. You've seen the guys that get married.”

Nick said nothing.

“You can tell them,”Bill said.“They get this sort of fat married look. They're done for.”

“Sure,”said Nick.

“It was probably bad busting it off,”Bill said.“But you always fall for somebody else and then it's all right. Fall for them but don't let them ruin you.”

“Yes,”said Nick.

“If you'd have married her you would have had to marry the whole family. Remember her mother and that guy she married.”

Nick nodded.

“Imagine having them around the house all the time and going to Sunday dinners at their house, and having them over to dinner and her telling Marge all the time what to do and how to act.”

Nick sat quiet.

“You came out of it damned well,”Bill said.“Now she can marry somebody of her own sort and settle down and be happy. You can't mix oil and water and you can't mix that sort of thing any more than if I'd marry Ida that works for Strattons. She'd probably like it, too.”

Nick said nothing. The liquor had all died out of him and left him alone. Bill wasn't there. He wasn't sitting in front of the fire or going fishing tomorrow with Bill and his dad or anything. He wasn't drunk. It was all gone. All he knew was that he had once had Marjorie and that he had lost her. She was gone and he had sent her away. That was all that mattered. He might never see her again. Probably he never would. It was all gone, finished.

“Let's have another drink,”Nick said.

Bill poured it out. Nick splashed in a little water.

“If you'd gone on that way we wouldn't be here now,”Bill said.

That was true. His original plan had been to go down home and get a job. Then he had planned to stay in Charlevoix all winter so he could be near Marge. Now he did not know what he was going to do.

“Probably we wouldn't even be going fishing tomorrow,”Bill said.“You had the right dope, all right.”

“I couldn't help it,”Nick said.

“I know. That's the way it works out,”Bill said.

“All of a sudden everything was over,”Nick said.“I don't know why it was. I couldn't help it. Just like when the three-day blows come now and rip all the leaves off the trees.”

“Well, it's over. That's the point,”Bill said.

“It was my fault,”Nick said.

“It doesn't make any difference whose fault it was,”Bill said.

“No, I suppose not,”Nick said.

The big thing was that Marjorie was gone and that probably he would never see her again. He had talked to her about how they would go to Italy together and the fun they would have. Places they would be together. It was all gone now.

“So long as it's over that's all that matters,”Bill said.“I tell you, Wemedge, I was worried while it was going on. You played it right. I understand her mother is sore as hell. She told a lot of people you were engaged.”

“We weren't engaged,”Nick said.

“It was all around that you were.”

“I can't help it,”Nick said.“We weren't.”

“Weren't you going to get married?”Bill asked.

“Yes. But we weren't engaged,”Nick said.

“What's the difference?”Bill asked judicially.

“I don't know. There's a difference.”

“I don't see it,”said Bill.

“All right,”said Nick.“Let's get drunk.”

“All right,”Bill said.“Let's get really drunk.”

“Let's get drunk and then go swimming,”Nick said.

He drank off his glass.

“I'm sorry as hell about her but what could I do?”he said.“You know what her mother was like!”

“She was terrible,”Bill said.

“All of a sudden it was over,”Nick said.“I oughtn't to talk about it.”

“You aren't,”Bill said.“I talked about it and now I'm through. We won't ever speak about it again. You don't want to think about it. You might get back into it again.”

Nick had not thought about that. It had seemed so absolute. That was a thought. That made him feel better.

“Sure,”he said.“There's always that danger.”

He felt happy now. There was not anything that was irrevocable. He might go into town Saturday night. Today was Thursday.

“There's always a chance,”he said.

“You'll have to watch yourself,”Bill said.

“I'll watch myself,”he said.

He felt happy. Nothing was finished. Nothing was ever lost. He would go into town on Saturday. He felt lighter, as he had felt before Bill started to talk about it. There was always a way out.

“Let's take the guns and go down to the point and look for your dad,”Nick said.

“All right.”

Bill took down the two shotguns from the rack on the wall. He opened a box of shells. Nick put on his Mackinaw coat and his shoes. His shoes were stiff from the drying. He was still quite drunk but his head was clear.

“How do you feel?”Nick asked.

“Swell. I've just got a good edge on.”Bill was buttoning up his sweater.

“There's no use getting drunk.”

“No. We ought to get outdoors.”

They stepped out the door. The wind was blowing a gale.

“The birds will lie right down in the grass with this,”Nick said.

They struck down toward the orchard.

“I saw a woodcock this morning,”Bill said.

“Maybe we'll jump him,”Nick said.

“You can't shoot in this wind,”Bill said.

Outside now the Marge business was no longer so tragic. It was not even very important. The wind blew everything like that away.

“It's coming right off the big lake,”Nick said.

Against the wind they heard the thud of a shotgun.

“That's dad,”Bill said.“He's down in the swamp.”

“Let's cut down that way,”Nick said.

“Let's cut across the lower meadow and see if we jump anything,”Bill said.

“All right,”Nick said.

None of it was important now. The wind blew it out of his head. Still he could always go into town Saturday night. It was a good thing to have in reserve.





The Battler


Nick stood up. He was all right. He looked up the track at the lights of the caboose going out of sight around the curve. There was water on both sides of the track, then tamarack swamp.

He felt of his knee. The pants were torn and the skin was barked. His hands were scraped and there were sand and cinders driven up under his nails. He went over to the edge of the track down the little slope to the water and washed his hands. He washed them carefully in the cold water, getting the dirt out from the nails. He squatted down and bathed his knee.

That lousy crut of a brakeman. He would get him some day. He would know him again. That was a fine way to act.

“Come here, kid,”he said.“I got something for you.”

He had fallen for it. What a lousy kid thing to have done. They would never suck him in that way again.

“Come here, kid, I got something for you.”Then wham and he lit on his hands and knees beside the track.

Nick rubbed his eye. There was a big bump coming up. He would have a black eye, all right. It ached already. That son of a crutting brake-man.

He touched the bump over his eye with his fingers. Oh, well, it was only a black eye. That was all he had gotten out of it. Cheap at the price. He wished he could see it. Could not see it looking into the water, though. It was dark and he was a long way off from anywhere. He wiped his hands on his trousers and stood up, then climbed the embankment to the rails.

He started up the track. It was well ballasted and made easy walking, sand and gravel packed between the ties, solid walking. The smooth roadbed like a causeway went on ahead through the swamp. Nick walked along. He must get to somewhere.

Nick had swung on to the freight train when it slowed down for the yards outside of Walton Junction. The train, with Nick on it, had passed through Kalkaska as it started to get dark. Now he must be nearly to Mancelona. Three or four miles of swamp. He stepped along the track, walking so he kept on the ballast between the ties, the swamp ghostly in the rising mist. His eye ached and he was hungry. He kept on hiking, putting the miles of track back of him. The swamp was all the same on both sides of the track.

Ahead there was a bridge. Nick crossed it, his boots ringing hollow on the iron. Down below the water showed black between the slits of ties. Nick kicked a loose spike and it dropped into the water. Beyond the bridge were hills. It was high and dark on both sides of the track. Up the track Nick saw a fire.

He came up the track toward the fire carefully. It was off to one side of the track, below the railway embankment. He had only seen the light from it. The track came out through a cut and where the fire was burning the country opened out and fell away into woods. Nick dropped carefully down the embankment and cut into the woods to come up to the fire through the trees. It was a beechwood forest and the fallen beechnut burrs were under his shoes as he walked between the trees. The fire was bright now, just at the edge of the trees. There was a man sitting by it. Nick waited behind the tree and watched. The man looked to be alone. He was sitting there with his head in his hands looking at the fire. Nick stepped out and walked into the firelight.

The man sat there looking into the fire. When Nick stopped quite close to him he did not move.

“Hello!”Nick said.

The man looked up.

“Where did you get the shiner?”he said.

“A brakeman busted me.”

“Off the through freight?”

“Yes.”

“I saw the bastard,”the man said.“He went through here 'bout an hour and a half ago. He was walking along the top of the cars slapping his arms and singing.”

“The bastard!”

“It must have made him feel good to bust you,”the man said seriously.

“I'll bust him.”

“Get him with a rock sometime when he's going through,”the man advised.

“I'll get him.”

“You're a tough one, aren't you?”

“No,”Nick answered.

“All you kids are tough.”

“You got to be tough,”Nick said.

“That's what I said.”

The man looked at Nick and smiled. In the firelight Nick saw that his face was misshapen. His nose was sunken, his eyes were slits, he had queer-shaped lips. Nick did not perceive all this at once, he only saw the man's face was queerly formed and mutilated. It was like putty in color. Dead looking in the firelight.

“Don't you like my pan?”the man asked.

Nick was embarrassed.

“Sure,”he said.

“Look here!”the man took off his cap.

He had only one ear. It was thickened and tight against the side of his head. Where the other ear should have been there was a stump.

“Ever see one like that?”

“No,”said Nick. It made him a little sick.

“I could take it,”the man said.“Don't you think I could take it, kid?”

“You bet!”

“They all bust their hands on me,”the little man said.“They couldn't hurt me.”

He looked at Nick.“Sit down,”he said.“Want to eat?”

“Don't bother,”Nick said.“I'm going on to the town.”

“Listen!”the man said.“Call me Ad.”

“Sure!”

“Listen,”the little man said.“I'm not quite right.”

“What's the matter?”

“I'm crazy.”

He put on his cap. Nick felt like laughing.

“You're all right,”he said.

“No, I'm not. I'm crazy. Listen, you ever been crazy?”

“No,”Nick said.“How does it get you?”

“I don't know,”Ad said.“When you got it you don't know about it. You know me, don't you?”

“No.”

“I'm Ad Francis.”

“Honest to God?”

“Don't you believe it?”

“Yes.”

Nick knew it must be true.

“You know how I beat them?”

“No,”Nick said.

“My heart's slow. It only beats forty a minute. Feel it.”

Nick hesitated.

“Come on,”the man took hold of his hand.“Take hold of my wrist. Put your fingers there.”

The little man's wrist was thick and the muscles bulged above the bone. Nick felt the slow pumping under his fingers.

“Got a watch?”

“No.”

“Neither have I,”Ad said.“It ain't any good if you haven't got a watch.”

Nick dropped his wrist.

“Listen,”Ad Francis said.“Take ahold again. You count and I'll count up to sixty.”

Feeling the slow hard throb under his fingers Nick started to count. He heard the little man counting slowly, one, two, three, four, five, and on—aloud.

“Sixty,”Ad finished.“That's a minute. What did you make it?”

“Forty,”Nick said.

“That's right,”Ad said happily.“She never speeds up.”

A man dropped down the railroad embankment and came across the clearing to the fire.

“Hello, Bugs!”Ad said.

“Hello!”Bugs answered. It was a negro's voice. Nick knew from the way he walked that he was a negro. He stood with his back to them, bending over the fire. He straightened up.

“This is my pal Bugs,”Ad said.“He's crazy, too.”

“Glad to meet you,”Bugs said.“Where you say you're from?”

“Chicago,”Nick said.

“That's a fine town,”the negro said.“I didn't catch your name.”

“Adams. Nick Adams.”

“He says he's never been crazy, Bugs,”Ad said.

“He's got a lot coming to him,”the negro said. He was unwrapping a package by the fire.

“When are we going to eat, Bugs?”the prizefighter asked.

“Right away.”

“Are you hungry, Nick?”

“Hungry as hell.”

“Hear that, Bugs?”

“I hear most of what goes on.”

“That ain't what I asked you.”

“Yes. I heard what the gentleman said.”

Into a skillet he was laying slices of ham. As the skillet grew hot the grease sputtered and Bugs, crouching on long nigger legs over the fire, turned the ham and broke eggs into the skillet, tipping it from side to side to baste the eggs with the hot fat.

“Will you cut some bread out of that bag, Mister Adams?”Bugs turned from the fire.

“Sure.”

Nick reached in the bag and brought out a loaf of bread. He cut six slices. Ad watched him and leaned forward.

“Let me take your knife, Nick,”he said.

“No, you don't,”the negro said.“Hang onto your knife, Mister Adams.”

The prizefighter sat back.

“Will you bring me the bread, Mister Adams?”Bugs asked. Nick brought it over.

“Do you like to dip your bread in the ham fat?”the negro asked.

“You bet!”

“Perhaps we'd better wait until later. It's better at the finish of the meal. Here.”

The negro picked up a slice of ham and laid it on one of the pieces of bread, then slid an egg on top of it.

“Just close that sandwich, will you, please, and give it to Mister Francis.”

Ad took the sandwich and started eating.

“Watch out how that egg runs,”the negro warned.“This is for you, Mister Adams. The remainder for myself.”

Nick bit into the sandwich. The negro was sitting opposite him beside Ad. The hot fried ham and eggs tasted wonderful.

“Mister Adams is right hungry,”the negro said. The little man whom Nick knew by name as a former champion fighter was silent. He had said nothing since the negro had spoken about the knife.

“May I offer you a slice of bread dipped right in the hot ham fat?”Bugs said.

“Thanks a lot.”

The little white man looked at Nick.

“Will you have some, Mister Adolph Francis?”Bugs offered from the skillet.

Ad did not answer. He was looking at Nick.

“Mister Francis?”came the nigger's soft voice.

Ad did not answer. He was looking at Nick.

“I spoke to you. Mister Francis,”the nigger said softly.

Ad kept on looking at Nick. He had his cap down over his eyes. Nick felt nervous.

“How the hell do you get that way?”came out from under the cap sharply at Nick.

“Who the hell do you think you are? You're a snotty bastard. You come in here where nobody asks you and eat a man's food and when he asks to borrow a knife you get snotty.”

He glared at Nick, his face was white and his eyes almost out of sight under the cap.

“You're a hot sketch. Who the hell asked you to butt in here?”

“Nobody.”

“You're damn right nobody did. Nobody asked you to stay either. You come in here and act snotty about my face and smoke my cigars and drink my liquor and then talk snotty. Where the hell do you think you get off?”

Nick said nothing. Ad stood up.

“I'll tell you, you yellow-livered Chicago bastard. You're going to get your can knocked off. Do you get that?”

Nick stepped back. The little man came toward him slowly, stepping flat-footed forward, his left foot stepping forward, his right dragging up to it.

“Hit me,”he moved his head.“Try and hit me.”

“I don't want to hit you.”

“You won't get out of it that way. You're going to take a beating, see? Come on and lead at me.”

“Cut it out,”Nick said.

“All right, then, you bastard.”

The little man looked down at Nick's feet. As he looked down the negro, who had followed behind him as he moved away from the fire, set himself and tapped him across the base of the skull. He fell forward and Bugs dropped the cloth-wrapped blackjack on the grass. The little man lay there, his face in the grass. The negro picked him up, his head hanging, and carried him to the fire. His face looked bad, the eyes open. Bugs laid him down gently.

“Will you bring me the water in the bucket, Mister Adams,”he said.“I'm afraid I hit him just a little hard.”

The negro splashed water with his hand on the man's face and pulled his ears gently. The eyes closed.

Bugs stood up.

“He's all right,”he said.“There's nothing to worry about. I'm sorry, Mister Adams.”

“It's all right.”Nick was looking down at the little man. He saw the blackjack on the grass and picked it up. It had a flexible handle and was limber in his hand. It was made of worn black leather with a handkerchief wrapped around the heavy end.

“That's a whalebone handle,”the negro smiled.“They don't make them any more. I didn't know how well you could take care of yourself and, anyway, I didn't want you to hurt him or mark him up no more than he is.”

The negro smiled again.

“You hurt him yourself.”

“I know how to do it. He won't remember nothing of it. I have to do it to change him when he gets that way.”

Nick was still looking down at the little man, lying, his eyes closed in the firelight. Bugs put some wood on the fire.

“Don't you worry about him none, Mister Adams. I seen him like this plenty of times before.”

“What made him crazy?”Nick asked.

“Oh, a lot of things,”the negro answered from the fire.“Would you like a cup of this coffee, Mister Adams?”

He handed Nick the cup and smoothed the coat he had placed under the unconscious man's head.

“He took too many beatings, for one thing,”the negro sipped the coffee.“But that just made him sort of simple. Then his sister was his manager and they was always being written up in the papers all about brothers and sisters and how she loved her brother and how he loved his sister, and then they got married in New York and that made a lot of unpleasantness.”

“I remember about it.”

“Sure. Of course they wasn't brother and sister no more than a rabbit, but there was a lot of people didn't like it either way and they commenced to have disagreements, and one day she just went off and never come back.”

He drank the coffee and wiped his lips with the pink palm of his hand.

“He just went crazy. Will you have some more coffee, Mister Adams?”

“Thanks.”

“I seen her a couple of times,”the negro went on.“She was an awful good-looking woman. Looked enough like him to be twins. He wouldn't be bad-looking without his face all busted.”

He stopped. The story seemed to be over.

“I met him in jail,”the negro said.“He was busting people all the time after she went away and they put him in jail. I was in for cuttin' a man.”

He smiled, and went on soft-voiced:

“Right away I liked him and when I got out I looked him up. He likes to think I'm crazy and I don't mind. I like to be with him and I like seeing the country and I don't have to commit no larceny to do it. I like living like a gentleman.”

“What do you all do?”Nick asked.

“Oh, nothing. Just move around. He's got money.”

“He must have made a lot of money.”

“Sure. He spent all his money, though. Or they took it away from him. She sends him money.”

He poked up the fire.

“She's a mighty fine woman,”he said.“She looks enough like him to be his own twin.”

The negro looked over at the little man, lying breathing heavily. His blond hair was down over his forehead. His mutilated face looked childish in repose.

“I can wake him up any time now, Mister Adams. If you don't mind I wish you'd sort of pull out. I don't like to not be hospitable, but it might disturb him back again to see you. I hate to have to thump him and it's the only thing to do when he gets started. I have to sort of keep him away from people. You don't mind, do you, Mister Adams? No, don't thank me, Mister Adams. I'd have warned you about him but he seemed to have taken such a liking to you and I thought things were going to be all right. You'll hit a town about two miles up the track. Mancelona they call it. Good-bye. I wish we could ask you to stay the night but it's just out of the question. Would you like to take some of that ham and some bread with you? No? You better take a sandwich,”all this in a low, smooth, polite nigger voice.

“Good. Well, good-bye, Mister Adams. Good-bye and good luck!”

Nick walked away from the fire across the clearing to the railway tracks. Out of the range of the fire he listened. The low soft voice of the negro was talking. Nick could not hear the words. Then he heard the little man say,“I got an awful headache, Bugs.”

“You'll feel better. Mister Francis,”the negro's voice soothed.“Just you drink a cup of this hot coffee.”

Nick climbed the embankment and started up the track. He found he had a ham sandwich in his hand and put it in his pocket. Looking back from the mounting grade before the track curved into the hills he could see the firelight in the clearing.





Mr. and Mrs. Elliot


Mr. and Mrs. Elliot tried very hard to have a baby. They tried as often as Mrs. Elliot could stand it. They tried in Boston after they were married and they tried coming over on the boat. They did not try very often on the boat because Mrs. Elliot was quite sick. She was sick and when she was sick she was sick as Southern women are sick. That is women from the Southern part of the United States. Like all Southern women Mrs. Elliot disintegrated very quickly under sea sickness, travelling at night, and getting up too early in the morning. Many of the people on the boat took her for Elliot's mother. Other people who knew they were married believed she was going to have a baby. In reality she was forty years old. Her years had been precipitated suddenly when she started travelling.

She had seemed much younger, in fact she had seemed not to have any age at all, when Elliot had married her after several weeks of making love to her after knowing her for a long time in her tea shop before he had kissed her one evening.

Hubert Elliot was taking postgraduate work in law at Harvard when he was married. He was a poet with an income of nearly ten thousand dollars a year. He wrote very long poems very rapidly. He was twenty-five years old and had never gone to bed with a woman until he married Mrs. Elliot. He wanted to keep himself pure so that he could bring to his wife the same purity of mind and body that he expected of her. He called it to himself living straight. He had been in love with various girls before he kissed Mrs. Elliot and always told them sooner or later that he had led a clean life. Nearly all the girls lost interest in him. He was shocked and really horrified at the way girls would become engaged to and marry men whom they must know had dragged themselves through the gutter. Heonce tried to warn a girl he knew against a man of whom he had almost proof that he had been a rotter at college and a very unpleasant incident had resulted.

Mrs. Elliot's name was Cornelia. She had taught him to call her Calutina, which was her family nickname in the South. His mother cried when he brought Cornelia home after their marriage but brightened very much when she learned they were going to live abroad.

Cornelia had said,“You dear sweet boy,”and held him closer than ever when he had told her how he had kept himself clean for her. Cornelia was pure too.“Kiss me again like that,”she said.

Hubert explained to her that he had learned that way of kissing from hearing a fellow tell a story once. He was delighted with his experiment and they developed it as far as possible. Sometimes when they had been kissing together a long time, Cornelia would ask him to tell her again that he had kept himself really straight for her. The declaration always set her off again.

At first Hubert had no idea of marrying Cornelia. He had never thought of her that way. She had been such a good friend of his, and then one day in the little back room of the shop they had been dancing to the gramophone while her girl friend was in the front of the shop and she had looked up into his eyes and he had kissed her. He could never remember just when it was decided that they were to be married. But they were married.

They spent the night of the day they were married in a Boston hotel. They were both disappointed but finally Cornelia went to sleep. Hubert could not sleep and several times went out and walked up and down the corridor of the hotel in his new Jaeger bathrobe that he had bought for his wedding trip. As he walked he saw all the pairs of shoes, small shoes and big shoes, outside the doors of the hotel rooms. This set his heart to pounding and he hurried back to his own room but Cornelia was asleep. He did not like to waken her and soon everything was quite all right and he slept peacefully.

The next day they called on his mother and the next day they sailed for Europe. It was possible to try to have a baby but Cornelia could not attempt it very often although they wanted a baby more than anything else in the world. They landed at Cherbourg and came to Paris. They tried to have a baby in Paris. Then they decided to go to Dijon where there was summer school and where a number of people who crossed on the boat with them had gone. They found there was nothing to do in Dijon. Hubert, however, was writing a great number of poems and Cornelia typed them for him. They were all very long poems. He was very severe about mistakes and would make her re-do an entire page if there was one mistake. She cried a good deal and they tried several times to have a baby before they left Dijon.

They came to Paris and most of their friends from the boat came back too. They were tired of Dijon and anyway would now be able to say that after leaving Harvard or Columbia or Wabash they had studied at the University of Dijon down in the Côte d'Or. Many of them would have preferred to go to Languedoc, Montpellier or Perpignan if there are universities there. But all those places are too far away. Dijon is only four and a half hours from Paris and there is a diner on the train.

So they all sat around the Café du Dome, avoiding the Rotonde across the street because it is always so full of foreigners, for a few days and then the Elliots rented a chateau in Touraine through an advertisement in the New York Herald. Elliot had a number of friends by now all of whom admired his poetry and Mrs. Elliot had prevailed upon him to send over to Boston for her girl friend who had been in the tea shop. Mrs. Elliot became much brighter after her girl friend came and they had many good cries together. The girl friend was several years older than Cornelia and called her Honey. She too came from a very old Southern family.

The three of them, with several of Elliot's friends who called him Hubie, went down to the chateau in Touraine. They found Touraine to be a veryflat hot country very much like Kansas. Elliot had nearly enough poems for a book now. He was going to bring it out in Boston and had already sent his check to, and made a contract with, a publisher.

In a short time the friends began to drift back to Paris. Touraine had not turned out the way it looked when it started. Soon all the friends had gone off with a rich young and unmarried poet to a seaside resort near Trouville. There they were all very happy.

Elliot kept on at the chateau in Touraine because he had taken it for all summer. He and Mrs. Elliot tried very hard to have a baby in the big hot bedroom on the big, hard bed. Mrs. Elliot was learning the touch system on the typewriter, but she found that while it increased the speed it made more mistakes. The girl friend was now typing practically all of the manuscripts. She was very neat and efficient and seemed to enjoy it.

Elliot had taken to drinking white wine and lived apart in his own room. He wrote a great deal of poetry during the night and in the morning looked very exhausted. Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend now slept together in the big mediaeval bed. They had many a good cry together. In the evening they all sat at dinner together in the garden under a plane tree and the hot evening wind blew and Elliot drank white wine and Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend made conversation and they were all quite happy.





Cat in the Rain


There were only two Americans stopping at the hotel. They did not know any of the people they passed on the stairs on their way to and from their room. Their room was on the second floor facing the sea. It also faced the public garden and the war monument. There were big palms and green benches in the public garden. In the good weather there was always an artist with his easel. Artists liked the way the palms grew and the bright colors of the hotels facing the gardens and the sea. Italians came from a long way off to look up at the war monument. It was made of bronze and glistened in the rain. It was raining. The rain dripped from the palm trees. Water stood in pools on the gravel paths. The sea broke in a long line in the rain and slipped back down the beach to come up and break again in a long line in the rain. The motor cars were gone from the square by the war monument. Across the square in the doorway of the café a waiter stood looking out at the empty square.

The American wife stood at the window looking out. Outside right under their window a cat was crouched under one of the dripping green tables. The cat was trying to make herself so compact that she would not be dripped on.

“I'm going down and get that kitty,”the American wife said.

“I'll do it,”her husband offered from the bed.

“No, I'll get it. The poor kitty out trying to keep dry under a table.”

The husband went on reading, lying propped up with the two pillows at the foot of the bed.

“Don't get wet,”he said.

The wife went downstairs and the hotel owner stood up and bowed to her as she passed the office. His desk was at the far end of the office. He was an old man and very tall.

“Il piove,”the wife said. She liked the hotel-keeper.

“Sì, sì, Signera, brutto tempo. It's very bad weather.”

He stood behind his desk in the far end of the dim room. The wife liked him. She liked the deadly serious way he received any complaints. She liked his dignity. She liked the way he wanted to serve her. She liked the way he felt about being a hotel-keeper. She liked his old, heavy face and big hands.

Liking him she opened the door and looked out. It was raining harder. A man in a rubber cape was crossing the empty square to the café. The cat would be around to the right. Perhaps she could go along under the eaves. As she stood in the doorway an umbrella opened behind her. It was the maid who looked after their room.

“You must not get wet,”she smiled, speaking Italian. Of course, the hotel-keeper had sent her.

With the maid holding the umbrella over her, she walked along the gravel path until she was under their window. The table was there, washed bright green in the rain, but the cat was gone. She was suddenly disappointed. The maid looked up at her.

“Ha perduto qualche cosa, Signora?”

“There was a cat,”said the American girl.

“A cat?”

“Sì, il gatto.”

“A cat?”the maid laughed.“A cat in the rain?”

“Yes,”she said,“under the table.”Then,“Oh, I wanted it so much. I wanted a kitty.”

When she talked English the maid's face tightened.

“Come, Signora,”she said.“We must get back inside. You will be wet.”

“I suppose so,”said the American girl.

They went back along the gravel path and passed in the door. The maid stayed outside to close the umbrella. As the American girl passed the office, the padrone bowed from his desk. Something felt very small and tight inside the girl. The padrone made her feel very small and at the same time really important. She had a momentary feeling of being of supreme importance. She went on up the stairs. She opened the door of the room. George was on the bed, reading.

“Did you get the cat?”he asked, putting the book down.

“It was gone.”

“Wonder where it went to,”he said, resting his eyes from reading.

She sat down on the bed.

“I wanted it so much,”she said.“I don't know why I wanted it so much. I wanted that poor kitty. It isn't any fun to be a poor kitty out in the rain.”

George was reading again.

She went over and sat in front of the mirror of the dressing table looking at herself with the hand glass. She studied her profile, first one side and then the other. Then she studied the back of her head and her neck.

“Don't you think it would be a good idea if I let my hair grow out?”she asked, looking at her profile again.

George looked up and saw the back of her neck, clipped close like a boy's.

“I like it the way it is.”

“I get so tired of it,”she said.“I get so tired of looking like a boy.”

George shifted his position in the bed. He hadn't looked away from her since she started to speak.

“You look pretty darn nice,”he said.

She laid the mirror down on the dresser and went over to the window and looked out. It was getting dark.

“I want to pull my hair back tight and smooth and make a big knot at the back that I can feel,”she said.“I want to have a kitty to sit on my lap and purr when I stroke her.”

“Yeah?”George said from the bed.

“And I want to eat at a table with my own silver and I want candles. And I want it to be spring and I want to brush my hair out in front of a mirror and I want a kitty and I want some new clothes.”

“Oh, shut up and get something to read,”George said. He was reading again.

His wife was looking out of the window. It was quite dark now and still raining in the palm trees.

“Anyway, I want a cat,”she said,“I want a cat. I want a cat now. If I can't have long hair or any fun, I can have a cat.”

George was not listening. He was reading his book. His wife looked out of the window where the light had come on in the square.

Someone knocked at the door.

“Avanti,”George said. He looked up from his book.

In the doorway stood the maid. She held a big tortoise-shell cat pressed tight against her and swung down against her body.

“Excuse me,”she said,“the padrone asked me to bring this for the Signora.”





Big Two-Hearted River　Part I


The train went on up the track out of sight, around one of the hills of burnt timber. Nick sat down on the bundle of canvas and bedding the baggage man had pitched out of the door of the baggage car. There was no town, nothing but the rails and the burned-over country. The thirteen saloons that had lined the one street of Seney had not left a trace. The foundations of the Mansion House hotel stuck up above the ground. The stone was chipped and split by the fire. It was all that was left of the town of Seney. Even the surface had been burned off the ground.

Nick looked at the burned-over stretch of hillside, where he had expected to find the scattered houses of the town and then walked down the railroad track to the bridge over the river. The river was there. It swirled against the log spiles of the bridge. Nick looked down into the clear, brown water, colored from the pebbly bottom, and watched the trout keeping themselves steady in the current with wavering fins. As he watched them they changed their positions by quick angles, only to hold steady in the fast water again. Nick watched them a long time.

He watched them holding themselves with their noses into the current, many trout in deep, fast moving water, slightly distorted as he watched far down through the glassy convex surface of the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log-driven piles of the bridge. At the bottom of the pool were the big trout. Nick did not see them at first. Then he saw them at the bottom of the pool, big trout looking to hold themselves on the gravel bottom in a varying mist of gravel and sand, raised in spurts by the current.

Nick looked down into the pool from the bridge. It was a hot day. A kingfisher flew up the stream. It was a long time since Nick had looked into a stream and seen trout. They were very satisfactory. As the shadow of the kingfisher moved up the stream, a big trout shot upstream in a long angle, only his shadow marking the angle, then lost his shadow as he came through the surface of the water, caught the sun, and then, as he went back into the stream under the surface, his shadow seemed to float down the stream with the current, unresisting, to his post under the bridge where he tightened facing up into the current.

Nick's heart tightened as the trout moved. He felt all the old feeling.

He turned and looked down the stream. It stretched away, pebbly-bottomed with shallows and big boulders and a deep pool as it curved away around the foot of a bluff.

Nick walked back up the ties to where his pack lay in the cinders beside the railway track. He was happy. He adjusted the pack harness around the bundle, pulling straps tight, slung the pack on his back, got his arms through the shoulder straps and took some of the pull off his shoulders by leaning his forehead against the wide band of the tump-line. Still, it was too heavy. It was much too heavy. He had his leather rod-case in his hand and leaning forward to keep the weight of the pack high on his shoulders he walked along the road that paralleled the railway track, leaving the burned town behind in the heat, and then turned off around a hill with a high, fire-scarred hill on either side onto a road that went back into the country. He walked along the road feeling the ache from the pull of the heavy pack. The road climbed steadily. It was hard work walking up-hill. His muscles ached and the day was hot, but Nick felt happy. He felt he had left everything behind, the need for thinking, the need to write, other needs. It was all back of him.

From the time he had gotten down off the train and the baggage man had thrown his pack out of the open car door things had been different. Seney was burned, the country was burned over and changed, but it did not matter. It could not all be burned. He knew that. He hiked along the road, sweating in the sun, climbing to cross the range of hills that separated the railway from the pine plains.

The road ran on, dipping occasionally, but always climbing. Nick went on up. Finally the road after going parallel to the burnt hillside reached the top. Nick leaned back against a stump and slipped out of the pack harness. Ahead of him, as far as he could see, was the pine plain. The burned country stopped off at the left with the range of hills. On ahead islands of dark pine trees rose out of the plain. Far off to the left was the line of the river. Nick followed it with his eye and caught glints of the water in the sun.

There was nothing but the pine plain ahead of him, until the far blue hills that marked the Lake Superior height of land. He could hardly see them, faint and far away in the heat-light over the plain. If he looked too steadily they were gone. But if he only half-looked they were there, the far-off hills of the height of land.

Nick sat down against the charred stump and smoked a cigarette. His pack balanced on the top of the stump, harness holding ready, a hollow molded in it from his back. Nick sat smoking, looking out over the country. He did not need to get his map out. He knew where he was from the position of the river.

As he smoked, his legs stretched out in front of him, he noticed a grasshopper walk along the ground and up onto his woolen sock. The grasshopper was black. As he had walked along the road, climbing, he had started many grasshoppers from the dust. They were all black. They were not the big grasshoppers with yellow and black or red and black wings whirring out from their black wing sheathing as they fly up. These were just ordinary hoppers, but all a sooty black in color. Nick had wondered about them as he walked, without really thinking about them. Now, as he watched the black hopper that was nibbling at the wool of his sock with its four way lip, he realized that they had all turned black from living in the burned-over land. He realized that the fire must have come the year before, but the grasshoppers were all black now. He wondered how long they would stay that way.

Carefully he reached his hand down and took hold of the hopper by the wings. He turned him up, all his legs walking in the air, and looked a his jointed belly. Yes, it was black too, iridescent where the back and head were dusty.

“Go on, hopper,”Nick said, speaking out loud for the first time.“Fly away somewhere.”

He tossed the grasshopper up into the air and watched him sail away to a charcoal stump across the road.

Nick stood up. He leaned his back against the weight of his pack where it rested upright on the stump and got his arms through the shoulder straps. He stood with the pack on his back on the brow of the hill looking out across the country toward the distant river and then struck down the hillside away from the road. Underfoot the ground was good walking. Two hundred yards down the hillside the fire line stopped. Then it was sweet fern, growing ankle high, to walk through, and clumps of jack pines; a long undulating country with frequent rises and descents, sandy underfoot and the country alive again.

Nick kept his direction by the sun. He knew where he wanted to strike the river and he kept on through the pine plain, mounting small rises to see other rises ahead of him and sometimes from the top of a rise a great solid island of pines off to his right or his left. He broke off some sprigs of the heathery sweet fern, and put them under his pack straps. The chafing crushed it and he smelled it as he walked.

He was tired and very hot, walking across the uneven, shadeless pine plain. At any time he knew he could strike the river by turning off to his left. It could not be more than a mile away. But he kept on toward the north to hit the river as far upstream as he could go in one day's walking.

For some time as he walked Nick had been in sight of one of the big islands of pine standing out above the rolling high ground he was crossing. He dipped down and then as he came slowly up to the crest of the bridge he turned and made toward the pine trees.

There was no underbrush in the island of pine trees. The trunks of the trees went straight up or slanted toward each other. The trunks were straight and brown without branches. The branches were high above. Some interlocked to make a solid shadow on the brown forest floor. Around the grove of trees was a bare space. It was brown and soft underfoot as Nick walked on it. This was the over-lapping of the pine needle floor, extending out beyond the width of the high branches. The trees had grown tall and the branches moved high, leaving in the sun this bare space they had once covered with shadow. Sharp at the edge of this extension of the forest floor commenced the sweet fern.

Nick slipped off his pack and lay down in the shade. He lay on his back and looked up into the pine trees. His neck and back and the small of his back rested as he stretched. The earth felt good against his back. He looked up at the sky, through the branches, and then shut his eyes. He opened them and looked up again. There was a wind high up in the branches. He shut his eyes again and went to sleep.

Nick woke stiff and cramped. The sun was nearly down. His pack was heavy and the straps painful as he lifted it on. He leaned over with the pack on and picked up the leather rod-case and started out from the pine trees across the sweet fern swale, toward the river. He knew it could not be more than a mile.

He came down a hillside covered with stumps into a meadow. At the edge of the meadow flowed the river. Nick was glad to get to the river. He walked upstream through the meadow. His trousers were soaked with the dew as he walked. After the hot day, the dew had come quickly and heavily. The river made no sound. It was too fast and smooth. At the edge of the meadow, before he mounted to a piece of high ground to make camp, Nick looked down the river at the trout rising. They were rising to insects come from the swamp on the other side of the stream when the sun went down. The trout jumped out of water to take them. While Nick walked through the little stretch of meadow alongside the stream, trout had jumped high out of water. Now as he looked down the river, the insects must be settling on the surface, for the trout were feeding steadily all down the stream. As far down the long stretch as he could see, the trout were rising, making circles all down the surface of the water, as though it were starting to rain.

The ground rose, wooded and sandy, to overlook the meadow, the stretch of river and the swamp. Nick dropped his pack and rod-case and looked for a level piece of ground. He was very hungry and he wanted to make his camp before he cooked. Between two jack pines, the ground was quite level. He took the ax out of the pack and chopped out two projecting roots. That leveled a piece of ground large enough to sleep on. He smoothed out the sandy soil with his hand and pulled all the sweet fern bushes by their roots. His hands smelled good from the sweet fern. He smoothed the uprooted earth. He did not want anything making lumps under the blankets. When he had the ground smooth, he spread his three blankets. One he folded double, next to the ground. The other two he spread on top.

With the ax he slit off a bright slab of pine from one of the stumps and split it into pegs for the tent. He wanted them long and solid to hold in the ground. With the tent unpacked and spread on the ground, the pack, leaning against a jackpine, looked much smaller. Nick tied the rope that served the tent for a ridge-pole to the trunk of one of the pine trees and pulled the tent up off the ground with the other end of the rope and tied it to the other pine. The tent hung on the rope like a canvas blanket on a clothesline. Nick poked a pole he had cut up under the back peak of the canvas and then made it a tent by pegging out the sides. He pegged the sides out taut and drove the pegs deep, hitting them down into the ground with the flat of the ax until the rope loops were buried and the canvas was drum tight.

Across the open mouth of the tent Nick fixed cheesecloth to keep out mosquitoes. He crawled inside under the mosquito bar with various things from the pack to put at the head of the bed under the slant of the canvas. Inside the tent the light came through the brown canvas. It smelled pleasantly of canvas. Already there was something mysterious and homelike. Nick was happy as he crawled inside the tent. He had not been unhappy all day. This was different though. Now things were done. There had been this to do. Now it was done. It had been a hard trip. He was very tired. That was done. He had made his camp. He was settled. Nothing could touch him. It was a good place to camp. He was there, in the good place. He was in his home where he had made it. Now he was hungry.

He came out, crawling under the cheesecloth. It was quite dark outside. It was lighter in the tent.

Nick went over to the pack and found, with his fingers, a long nail in a paper sack of nails, in the bottom of the pack. He drove it into the pine tree, holding it close and hitting it gently with the flat of the ax. He hung the pack up on the nail. All his supplies were in the pack. They were off the ground and sheltered now.

Nick was hungry. He did not believe he had ever been hungrier. He opened and emptied a can of pork and beans and a can of spaghetti into the frying pan.

“I've got a right to eat this kind of stuff, if I'm willing to carry it,”Nick said. His voice sounded strange in the darkening woods. He did not speak again.

He started a fire with some chunks of pine he got with the ax from a stump. Over the fire he stuck a wire grill, pushing the four legs down into the ground with his boot. Nick put the frying pan on the grill over the flames. He was hungrier. The beans and spaghetti warmed. Nick stirred them and mixed them together. They began to bubble, making little bubbles that rose with difficulty to the surface. There was a good smell. Nick got out a bottle of tomato catchup and cut four slices of bread. The little bubbles were coming faster now. Nick sat down beside the fire and lifted the frying pan off. He poured about half the contents out into the tin plate. It spread slowly on the plate. Nick knew it was too hot. He poured on some tomato catchup. He knew the beans and spaghetti were still too hot. He looked at the fire, then at the tent, he was not going to spoil it all by burning his tongue. For years he had never enjoyed fried bananas because he had never been able to wait for them to cool. His tongue was very sensitive. He was very hungry. Across the river in the swamp, in the almost dark, he saw a mist rising. He looked at the tent once more. All right. He took a full spoonful from the plate.

“Chrise,”Nick said,“Geezus Chrise,”he said happily.

He ate the whole plateful before he remembered the bread. Nick finished the second plateful with the bread, mopping the plate shiny. He had not eaten since a cup of coffee and a ham sandwich in the station restaurant at St. Ignace. It had been a very fine experience. He had been that hungry before, but had not been able to satisfy it. He could have made camp hours before if he had wanted to. There were plenty of good places to camp on the river. But this was good.

Nick tucked two big chips of pine under the grill. The fire flared up. He had forgotten to get water for the coffee. Out of the pack he got a folding canvas bucket and walked down the hill, across the edge of the meadow, to the stream. The other bank was in the white mist. The grass was wet and cold as he knelt on the bank and dipped the canvas bucket into the stream. It bellied and pulled hard in the current. The water was ice cold. Nick rinsed the bucket and carried it full up to the camp. Up away from the stream it was not so cold.

Nick drove another big nail and hung up the bucket full of water. He dipped the coffee pot half full, put some more chips under the grill onto the fire and put the pot on. He could not remember which way he made coffee. He could remember an argument about it with Hopkins, but not which side he had taken. He decided to bring it to a boil. He remembered now that was Hopkins's way. He had once argued about everything with Hopkins. While he waited for the coffee to boil, he opened a small can of apricots. He liked to open cans. He emptied the can of apricots out into a tin cup. While he watched the coffee on the fire, he drank the juice syrup of the apricots, carefully at first to keep from spilling, then meditatively, sucking the apricots down. They were better than fresh apricots.

The coffee boiled as he watched. The lid came up and coffee and grounds ran down the side of the pot. Nick took it off the grill. It was a triumph for Hopkins. He put sugar in the empty apricot cup and poured some of the coffee out to cool. It was too hot to pour and he used his hat to hold the handle of the coffee pot. He would not let it steep in the pot at all. Not the first cup. It should be straight Hopkins all the way. Hop deserved that. He was a very serious coffee drinker. He was the most serious man Nick had ever known. Not heavy, serious. That was a long time ago. Hopkins spoke without moving his lips. He had played polo. He made millions of dollars in Texas. He had borrowed carfare to go to Chicago, when the wire came that his first big well had come in. He could have wired for money. That would have been too slow. They called Hop's girl the Blonde Venus. Hop did not mind because she was not his real girl. Hopkins said very confidently that none of them would make fun of his real girl. He was right. Hopkins went away when the telegram came. That was on the Black River. It took eight days for the telegram to reach him. Hopkins gave away his .22 caliber Colt automatic pistol to Nick. He gave his camera to Bill. It was to remember him always by. They were all going fishing again next summer. The Hop Head was rich. He would get a yacht and they would all cruise along the north shore of Lake Superior. He was excited but serious. They said good-bye and all felt bad. It broke up the trip. They never saw Hopkins again. That was a long time ago on the Black River.

Nick drank the coffee, the coffee according to Hopkins. The coffee was bitter. Nick laughed. It made a good ending to the story. His mind was starting to work. He knew he could choke it because he was tired enough. He spilled the coffee out of the pot and shook the grounds loose into the fire. He lit a cigarette and went inside the tent. He took off his shoes and trousers, sitting on the blankets, rolled the shoes up inside the trousers for a pillow and got in between the blankets.

Out through the front of the tent he watched the glow of the fire, when the night wind blew on it. It was a quiet night. The swamp was perfectly quiet. Nick stretched under the blanket comfortably. A mosquito hummed close to his ear. Nick sat up and lit a match. The mosquito was on the canvas, over his head. Nick moved the match quickly up to it. The mosquito made a satisfactory hiss in the flame. The match went out. Nick lay down again under the blanket. He turned on his side and shut his eyes. He was sleepy. He felt sleep coming. He curled up under the blanket and went to sleep.





Big Two-Hearted River　Part II


In the morning the sun was up and the tent was starting to get hot. Nick crawled out under the mosquito netting stretched across the mouth of the tent, to look at the morning. The grass was wet on his hands as he came out. He held his trousers and his shoes in his hands. The sun was just up over the hill. There was the meadow, the river and the swamp. There were birch trees in the green of the swamp on the other side of the river.

The river was clear and smoothly fast in the early morning. Down about two hundred yards were three logs all the way across the stream. They made the water smooth and deep above them. As Nick watched, a mink crossed the river on the logs and went into the swamp. Nick was excited. He was excited by the early morning and the river. He was really too hurried to eat breakfast, but he knew he must. He built a little fire and put on the coffee pot.

While the water was heating in the pot he took an empty bottle and went down over the edge of the high ground to the meadow. The meadow was wet with dew and Nick wanted to catch grasshoppers for bait before the sun dried the grass. He found plenty of good grasshoppers. They were at the base of the grass stems. Sometimes they clung to a grass stem. They were cold and wet with the dew, and could not jump until the sun warmed them. Nick picked them up, taking only the medium-sized brown ones, and put them into the bottle. He turned over a log and just under the shelter of the edge were several hundred hoppers. It was a grasshopper lodging house. Nick put about fifty of the medium browns into the bottle. While he was picking up the hoppers the others warmed in the sun and commenced to hop away. They flew when they hopped. At first they made one flight and stayed stiff when they landed, as though they were dead.

Nick knew that by the time he was through with breakfast they would be as lively as ever. Without dew in the grass it would take him all day to catch a bottle full of good grasshoppers and he would have to crush many of them, slamming at them with his hat. He washed his hands at the stream. He was excited to be near it. Then he walked up to the tent. The hoppers were already jumping stiffly in the grass. In the bottle, warmed by the sun, they were jumping in a mass. Nick put in a pine stick as a cork. It plugged the mouth of the bottle enough, so the hoppers could not get out and left plenty of air passage.

He had rolled the log back and knew he could get grasshoppers there every morning.

Nick laid the bottle full of jumping grasshoppers against a pine trunk. Rapidly he mixed some buckwheat flour with water and stirred it smooth, one cup of flour, one cup of water. He put a handful of coffee in the pot and dipped a lump of grease out of a can and slid it sputtering across the hot skillet. On the smoking skillet he poured smoothly the buckwheat batter. It spread like lava, the grease spitting sharply. Around the edges the buckwheat cake began to firm, then brown, then crisp. The surface was bubbling slowly to porousness. Nick pushed under the browned under surface with a fresh pine chip. He shook the skillet sideways and the cake was loose on the surface. I won't try and flop it, he thought. He slid the chip of clean wood all the way under the cake, and flopped it over onto its face. It sputtered in the pan.

When it was cooked Nick regreased the skillet. He used all the batter. It made another big flapjack and one smaller one.

Nick ate a big flapjack and a smaller one, covered with apple butter. He put apple butter on the third cake, folded it over twice, wrapped it in oiled paper and put it in his shirt pocket. He put the apple butter jar back in the pack and cut bread for two sandwiches.

In the pack he found a big onion. He sliced it in two and peeled the silky outer skin. Then he cut one half into slices and made onion sandwiches. He wrapped them in oiled paper and buttoned them in the other pocket of his khaki shirt. He turned the skillet upside down on the grill, drank the coffee, sweetened and yellow brown with the condensed milk in it, and tidied up the camp. It was a good camp.

Nick took his fly rod out of the leather rod-case, jointed it, and shoved the rod-case back into the tent. He put on the reel and threaded the line through the guides. He had to hold it from hand to hand, as he threaded it, or it would slip back through its own weight. It was a heavy, double tapered fly line. Nick had paid eight dollars for it a long time ago. It was made heavy to lift back in the air and come forward flat and heavy and straight to make it possible to cast a fly which has no weight. Nick opened the aluminum leader box. The leaders were coiled between the damp flannel pads. Nick had wet the pads at the water cooler on the train up to St. Ignace. In the damp pads the gut leaders had softened and Nick unrolled one and tied it by a loop at the end to the heavy fly line. He fastened a hook on the end of the leader. It was a small hook; very thin and springy.

Nick took it from his hook book, sitting with the rod across his lap. He tested the knot and the spring of the rod by pulling the line taut. It was a good feeling. He was careful not to let the hook bite into his finger.

He started down to the stream, holding his rod, the bottle of grasshoppers hung from his neck by a thong tied in half hitches around the neck of the bottle. His landing net hung by a hook from his belt. Over his shoulder was a long flour sack tied at each corner into an ear. The cord went over his shoulder. The sack flapped against his legs.

Nick felt awkward and professionally happy with all his equipment hanging from him. The grasshopper bottle swung against his chest. In his shirt the breast pockets bulged against him with the lunch and his fly book.

He stepped in to the stream. It was a shock. His trousers clung tight to his legs. His shoes felt the gravel. The water was a rising cold shock.

Rushing, the current sucked against his legs. Where he stepped in the water was over his knees. He waded with the current. The gravel slid under his shoes. He looked down at the swirl of water below each leg and tipped up the bottle to get a grasshopper.

The first grasshopper gave a jump in the neck of the bottle and went out into the water. He was sucked under in the whirl by Nick's right leg and came to the surface a little way down stream. He floated rapidly, kicking. In a quick circle, breaking the smooth surface of the water, he disappeared. A trout had taken him.

Another hopper poked his face out of the bottle. His antennae wavered. He was getting his front legs out of the bottle to jump. Nick took him by the head and held him while he threaded the slim hook under his chin, down through his thorax and into the last segments of his abdomen. The grasshopper took hold of the hook with his front feel, spitting tobacco juice on it. Nick dropped him into the water.

Holding the rod in his right hand he let out line against the pull of the grasshopper in the current. He stripped off line from the reel with his left hand and let it run free. He could see the hopper in the little waves of the current. It went out of sight.

There was a tug on the line. Nick pulled against the taut line. It was his first strike. Holding the now living rod across the current, he brought in the line with his left hand. The rod bent in jerks, the trout pumping against the current. Nick knew it was a small one. He lifted the rod straight up in the air. It bowed with the pull.

He saw the trout in the water jerking with his head and body against the shifting tangent of the line in the stream.

Nick took the line in his left hand and pulled the trout, thumping tiredly against the current, to the surface. His back was mottled the clear, water-over-gravel color, his side flashing in the sun. The rod under his right arm, Nick stooped, dipping his right hand into the current. He held the trout, never still, with his moist right hand, while he unhooked the barb from his mouth, then dropped him back into the stream.

He hung unsteadily in the current, then settled to the bottom beside a stone. Nick reached down his hand to touch him, his arm to the elbow under water. The trout was steady in the moving stream, resting on the gravel, beside a stone. As Nick's fingers touched him, touched his smooth, cool, underwater feeling he was gone, gone in a shadow across the bottom of the stream.

He's all right, Nick thought. He was only tired.

He had wet his hand before he touched the trout, so he would not disturb the delicate mucus that covered him. If a trout was touched with a dry hand, a white fungus attacked the unprotected spot. Years before when he had fished crowded streams, with fly fishermen ahead of him and behind him, Nick had again and again come on dead trout, furry with white fungus, drifted against a rock, or floating belly up in some pool. Nick did not like to fish with other men on the river. Unless they were of your party, they spoiled it.

He wallowed down the stream, above his knees in the current, through the fifty yards of shallow water above the pile of logs that crossed the stream. He did not rebait his hook and held it in his hand as he waded. He was certain he could catch small trout in the shallows, but he did not want them. There would be no big trout in the shallows this time of day.

Now the water deepened up his thighs sharply and coldly. Ahead was the smooth dammed-back flood of water above the logs. The water was smooth and dark; on the left, the lower edge of the meadow; on the right the swamp.

Nick leaned back against the current and took a hopper from the bottle. He threaded the hopper on the hook and spat on him for good luck. Then he pulled several yards of line from the reel and tossed the hopper out ahead onto the fast, dark water. It floated down towards the logs, then the weight of the line pulled the bait under the surface. Nick held the rod in his right hand, letting the line run out through his fingers.

There was a long tug. Nick struck and the rod came alive and dangerous, bent double, the line tightening, coming out of water, tightening, all in a heavy, dangerous, steady pull. Nick felt the moment when the leader would break if the strain increased and let the line go.

The reel ratcheted into a mechanical shriek as the line went out in a rush. Too fast. Nick could not check it, the line rushing out, the reel note rising as the line ran out.

With the core of the reel showing, his heart feeling stopped with the excitement, leaning back against the current that mounted icily his thighs, Nick thumbed the reel hard with his left hand. It was awkward getting his thumb inside the fly reel frame.

As he put on pressure the line tightened into sudden hardness and beyond the logs a huge trout went high out of water. As he jumped, Nick lowered the tip of the rod. But he felt, as he dropped the tip to ease the strain, the moment when the strain was too great; the hardness too tight. Of course, the leader had broken. There was no mistaking the feeling when all spring left the line and it became dry and hard. Then it went slack.

His mouth dry, his heart down, Nick reeled in. He had never seen so big a trout. There was a heaviness, a power not to be held, and then the bulk of him, as he jumped. He looked as broad as a salmon.

Nick's hand was shaky. He reeled in slowly. The thrill had been too much. He felt, vaguely, a little sick, as though it would be better to sit down.

The leader had broken where the hook was tied to it. Nick took it in his hand. He thought of the trout somewhere on the bottom, holding himself steady over the gravel, far down below the light, under the logs, with the hook in his jaw. Nick knew the trout's teeth would cut through the snell of the hook. The hook would imbed itself in his jaw. He'd bet the trout was angry. Anything that size would be angry. That was a trout. He had been solidly hooked. Solid as a rock. He felt like a rock, too, before he started off. By God, he was a big one. By God, he was the biggest one I ever heard of.

Nick climbed out onto the meadow and stood, water running down his trousers and out of his shoes, his shoes squelchy. He went over and sat on the logs. He did not want to rush his sensations any.

He wriggled his toes in the water, in his shoes, and got out a cigarette from his breast pocket. He lit it and tossed the match into the fast water below the logs. A tiny trout rose at the match, as it swung around in the fast current. Nick laughed. He would finish the cigarette.

He sat on the logs, smoking, drying in the sun, the sun warm on his back, the river shallow ahead entering the woods, curving into the woods, shallows, light glittering, big water-smooth rocks, cedars along the bank and white birches, the logs warm in the sun, smooth to sit on, without bark, gray to the touch; slowly the feeling of disappointment left him. It went away slowly, the feeling of disappointment that came sharply after the thrill that made his shoulders ache. It was all right now. His rod lying out on the logs, Nick tied a new hook on the leader, pulling the gut tight until it grimped into itself in a hard knot.

He baited up, then picked up the rod and walked to the far end of the logs to get into the water, where it was not too deep. Under and beyond the logs was a deep pool. Nick walked around the shallow shelf near the swamp shore until he came out on the shallow bed of the stream.

On the left, where the meadow ended and the woods began, a great elm tree was uprooted. Gone over in a storm, it lay back into the woods, its roots clotted with dirt, grass growing in them, rising a solid bank beside the stream. The river cut to the edge of the uprooted tree. From where Nick stood he could see deep channels, like ruts, cut in the shallow bed of the stream by the flow of the current. Pebbly where he stood and pebbly and full of boulders beyond; where it curved near the tree roots, the bed of the stream was marly and between the ruts of deep water green weed fronds swung in the current.

Nick swung the rod back over his shoulder and forward, and the line, curving forward, laid the grasshopper down on one of the deep channels in the weeds. A trout struck and Nick hooked him.

Holding the rod far out toward the uprooted tree and sloshing backward in the current, Nick worked the trout, plunging, the rod bending alive, out of the danger of the weeds into the open river. Holding the rod, pumping alive against the current, Nick brought the trout in. He rushed, but always came, the spring of the rod yielding to the rushes, sometimes jerking under water, but always bringing him in. Nick eased downstream with the rushes. The rod above his head he led the trout over the net, then lifted.

The trout hung heavy in the net, mottled trout back and silver sides in the meshes. Nick unhooked him; heavy sides, good to hold, big undershot jaw, and slipped him, heaving and big sliding, into the long sack that hung from his shoulders in the water.

Nick spread the mouth of the sack against the current and it filled, heavy with water. He held it up, the bottom in the stream, and the water poured out through the sides. Inside at the bottom was the big trout, alive in the water.

Nick moved downstream. The sack out ahead of him sunk heavy in the water, pulling from his shoulders.

It was getting hot, the sun hot on the back of his neck.

Nick had one good trout. He did not care about getting many trout. Now the stream was shallow and wide. There were trees along both banks. The trees of the left bank made short shadows on the current in the forenoon sun. Nick knew there were trout in each shadow. In the afternoon, after the sun had crossed toward the hills, the trout would be in the cool shadows on the other side of the stream.

The very biggest ones would lie up close to the bank. You could always pick them up there on the Black. When the sun was down they all moved out into the current. Just when the sun made the water blinding in the glare before it went down, you were liable to strike a big trout anywhere in the current. It was almost impossible to fish then, the surface of the water was blinding as a mirror in the sun. Of course, you could fish upstream, but in a stream like the Black, or this, you had to wallow against the current and in a deep place, the water piled up on you. It was no fun to fish upstream with this much current.

Nick moved along through the shallow stretch watching the banks for deep holes. A beech tree grew close beside the river, so that the branches hung down into the water. The stream went back in under the leaves. There were always trout in a place like that.

Nick did not care about fishing that hole. He was sure he would get hooked in the branches.

It looked deep though. He dropped the grasshopper so the current took it under water, back in under the overhanging branch. The line pulled hard and Nick struck. The trout threshed heavily, half out of water in the leaves and branches. The line was caught. Nick pulled hard and the trout was off. He reeled in and holding the hook in his hand, walked down the stream.

Ahead, close to the left bank, was a big log. Nick saw it was hollow; pointing up river the current entered it smoothly, only a little ripple spread each side of the log. The water was deepening. The top of the hollow log was gray and dry. It was partly in the shadow.

Nick took the cork out of the grasshopper bottle and a hopper clung to it. He picked him off, hooked him and tossed him out. He held the rod far out so that the hopper on the water moved into the current flowing into the hollow log. Nick lowered the rod and the hopper floated in. There was a heavy strike. Nick swung the rod against the pull. It felt as though he were hooked into the log itself, except for the live feeling.

He tried to force the fish out into the current. It came, heavily.

The line went slack and Nick thought the trout was gone. Then he saw him, very near, in the current, shaking his head, trying to get the hook out. His mouth was clamped shut. He was fighting the hook in the clear flowing current.

Looping in the line with his left hand, Nick swung the rod to make the line taut and tried to lead the trout toward the net, but he was gone, out of sight, the line pumping. Nick fought him against the current, letting him thump in the water against the spring of the rod. He shifted the rod to his left hand, worked the trout upstream, holding his weight, fighting on the rod, and then let him down into the net. He lifted him clear of the water, a heavy half circle in the net, the net dripping, unhooked him and slid him into the sack.

He spread the mouth of the sack and looked down in at the two big trout alive in the water.

Through the deepening water, Nick waded over to the hollow log. He took the sack off, over his head, the trout flopping as it came out of water, and hung it so the trout were deep in the water. Then he pulled himself up on the log and sat, the water from his trouser and boots running down into the stream. He laid his rod down, moved along to the shady end of the log and took the sandwiches out of his pocket. He dipped the sandwiches in the cold water. The current carried away the crumbs. He ate the sandwiches and dipped his hat full of water to drink, the water running out through his hat just ahead of his drinking.

It was cool in the shade, sitting on the log. He took a cigarette out and struck a match to light it. The match sunk into the gray wood, making a tiny furrow. Nick leaned over the side of the log, found a hard place and lit the match. He sat smoking and watching the river.

Ahead the river narrowed and went into a swamp. The river became smooth and deep and the swamp looked solid with cedar trees, their trunks close together, their branches solid. It would not be possible to walk through a swamp like that. The branches grew so low. You would have to keep almost level with the ground to move at all. You could not crash through the branches. That must be why the animals that lived in swamps were built the way they were, Nick thought.

He wished he had brought something to read. He felt like reading. He did not feel like going on into the swamp. He looked down the river. A big cedar slanted all the way across the stream. Beyond that the river went into the swamp.

Nick did not want to go in there now. He felt a reaction against deep wading with the water deepening up under his armpits, to hook big trout in places impossible to land them. In the swamp the banks were bare, the big cedars came together overhead, the sun did not come through, except in patches; in the fast deep water, in the half light, the fishing would be tragic. In the swamp fishing was a tragic adventure. Nick did not want it. He did not want to go down the stream any further today.

He took out his knife, opened it and stuck it in the log. Then he pulled up the sack, reached into it and brought out one of the trout. Holding him near the tail, hard to hold, alive, in his hand, he whacked him against the log. The trout quivered, rigid. Nick laid him on the log in the shade and broke the neck of the other fish the same way. He laid them side by side on the log. They were fine trout.

Nick cleaned them, slitting them from the vent to the tip of the jaw. All the insides and the gills and tongue came out in one piece. They were both males; long gray-white strips of milt, smooth and clean. All the insides clean and compact, coming out all together. Nick tossed the offal ashore for the minks to find.

He washed the trout in the stream. When he held them back up in the water they looked like live fish. Their color was not gone yet. He washed his hands and dried them on the log. Then he laid the trout on the sack spread out on the log, rolled them up in it, tied the bundle and put it in the landing net. His knife was still standing, blade stuck in the log. He cleaned it on the wood and put it in his pocket.

Nick stood up on the log, holding his rod, the landing net hanging heavy, then stepped into the water and splashed ashore. He climbed the bank and cut up into the woods, toward the high ground. He was going back to camp. He looked back. The river just showed through the trees. There were plenty of days coming when he could fish the swamp.





After the Storm


It wasn't about anything, something about making punch, and then we started fighting and I slipped and he had me down kneeling on my chest and choking me with both hands like he was trying to kill me and all the time I was trying to get the knife out of my pocket to cut him loose. Everybody was too drunk to pull him off me. He was choking me and hammering my head on the floor and I got the knife out and opened it up; and I cut the muscle right across his arm and he let go of me. He couldn't have held on if he wanted to. Then he rolled and hung onto that arm and started to cry and I said:

“What the hell you want to choke me for?”

I'd have killed him. I couldn't swallow for a week. He hurt my throat bad.

Well, I went out of there and there were plenty of them with him and some came out after me and I made a turn and was down by the docks and I met a fellow and he said somebody killed a man up the street. I said“Who killed him?”and he said“I don't know who killed him but he's dead all right,”and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights and windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside of Mango Key and she was all right only she was full of water. So I bailed her out and pumped her out and there was a moon but plenty of clouds and still plenty rough and I took it down along; and when it was daylight I was off Eastern Harbor.

Brother, that was some storm. I was the first boat out and you never saw water like that was. It was just as white as a lye barrel and coming from Eastern Harbor to Sou'west Key you couldn't recognize the shore. There was a big channel blown right out through the middle of the beach. Trees and all blown out and a channel cut through and all the water white as chalk and everything on it; branches and whole trees and dead birds, and all floating. Inside the keys were all the pelicans in the world and all kinds of birds flying. They must have gone inside there when they knew it was coming.

I lay at Sou'west Key a day and nobody came after me. I was the first boat out and I seen a spar floating and I knew there must be a wreck and I started out to look for her. I found her. She was a three-masted schooner and I could just see the stumps of her spars out of water. She was in too deep water and I didn't get anything off of her. So I went on looking for something else. I had the start on all of them and I knew I ought to get whatever there was. I went on down over the sand-bars from where I left that three-masted schooner and I didn't find anything and I went on a long way. I was way out toward the quicksands and I didn't find anything so I went on. Then when I was in sight of the Rebecca light I saw all kinds of birds making over something and I headed over for them to see what it was and there was a cloud of birds all right.

I could see something looked like a spar up out of the water and when I got over close the birds all went up in the air and stayed all around me. The water was clear out there and there was a spar of some kind sticking out just above the water and when I come up close to it I saw it was all dark under water like a long shadow and I came right over it and there under water was a liner; just lying there all under water as big as the whole world. I drifted over her in the boat. She lay on her side and the stern was deep down. The port holes were all shut tight and I could see the glass shine in the water and the whole of her; the biggest boat I ever saw in my life laying there and I went along the whole length of her and then I went over and anchored and I had the skiff on the deck forward and I shoved it down into the water and sculled over with the birds all around me.

I had a water glass like we use sponging and my hand shook so I could hardly hold it. All the port holes were shut that you could see going along over her but way down below near the bottom something must have been open because there were pieces of things floating out all the time. You couldn't tell what they were. Just pieces. That's what the birds were after. You never saw so many birds. They were all around me; crazy yelling.

I could see everything sharp and clear. I could see her rounded over and she looked a mile long under the water. She was lying on a clear white bank of sand and the spar was a sort of foremast or some sort of tackle that slanted out of water the way she was laying on her side. Her bow wasn't very far under. I could stand on the letters of her name on her bow and my head was just out of water. But the nearest port hole was twelve feet down. I could just reach it with the grains pole and I tried to break it with that but I couldn't. The glass was too stout. So I sculled back to the boat and got a wrench and lashed it to the end of the grains pole and I couldn't break it. There I was looking down through the glass at that liner with everything in her and I was the first one to her and I couldn't get into her. She must have had five million dollars worth in her.

It made me shaky to think how much she must have in her. Inside the port hole that was closest I could see something but I couldn't make it out through the water glass. I couldn't do any good with the grains pole and I took off my clothes and stood and took a couple of deep breaths and dove over off the stern with the wrench in my hand and swam down. I could hold on for a second to the edge of the port hole and I could see in and there was a woman inside with her hair floating all out. I could see her floating plain and I hit the glass twice with the wrench hard and I heard the noise clink in my ears but it wouldn't break and I had to come up.

I hung onto the dinghy and got my breath and then I climbed in and took a couple of breaths and dove again. I swam down and took hold of the edge of the port hole with my fingers and held it and hit the glass as hard as I could with the wrench. I could see the woman floated in the water through the glass. Her hair was tied once close to her head and it floated all out in the water. I could see the rings on one of her hands. She was right up close to the port hole and I hit the glass twice and I didn't even crack it. When I came up I thought I wouldn't make it to the top before I'd have to breathe.

I went down once more and I cracked the glass, only cracked it, and when I came up my nose was bleeding and I stood on the bow of the liner with my bare feet on the letters of her name and my head just out and rested there and then I swam over to the skiff and pulled up into it and sat there waiting for my head to stop aching and looking down into the water glass, but I bled so I had to wash out the water glass. Then I lay back in the skiff and held my hand under my nose to stop it and I lay there with my head back looking up and there was a million birds above and all around.

When I quit bleeding I took another look through the glass and then I sculled over to the boat to try and find something heavier than the wrench but I couldn't find a thing; not even a sponge hook. I went back and the water was clearer all the time and you could see everything that floated out over that white bank of sand. I looked for sharks but there weren't any. You could have seen a shark a long way away. The water was so clear and the sand white. There was a grapple for an anchor on the skiff and I cut it off and went overboard and down with it. It carried me right down and past the port hole and I grabbed and couldn't hold anything and went on down and down, sliding along the curved side of her. I had to let go of the grapple. I heard it bump once and it seemed like a year before I came up through to the top of the water. The skiff was floated away with the tide and I swam over to her with my nose bleeding in the water while I swam and I was plenty glad there weren't sharks; but I was tired.

My head felt cracked open and I lay in the skiff and rested and then I sculled back. It was getting along in the afternoon. I went down once more with the wrench and it didn't do any good. That wrench was too light. It wasn't any good diving unless you had a big hammer or something heavy enough to do good. Then I lashed the wrench to the grains pole again and I watched through the water glass and pounded on the glass and hammered until the wrench came off and I saw it in the glass, clear and sharp, go sliding down along her and then off and down to the quicksand and go in. Then I couldn't do a thing. The wrench was gone and I'd lost the grapple so I sculled back to the boat. I was too tired to get the skiff aboard and the sun was pretty low. The birds were all pulling out and leaving her and I headed for Sou'west Key towing the skiff and the birds going on ahead of me and behind me. I was plenty tired.

That night it came on to blow and it blew for a week. You couldn't get out to her. They come out from town and told me the fellow I'd had to cut was all right except for his arm and I went back to town and they put me under five hundred dollar bond. It came out all right because some of them, friends of mine, swore he was after me with an ax, but by the time we got back out to her the Greeks had blown her open and cleaned her out. They got the safe out with dynamite. Nobody ever knows how much they got. She carried gold and they got it all. They stripped her clean. I found her and I never got a nickel out of her.

It was a hell of a thing all right. They say she was just outside of Havana harbor when the hurricane hit and she couldn't get in or the owners wouldn't let the captain chance coming in; they say he wanted to try; so she had to go with it and in the dark they were running with it trying to go through the gulf between Rebecca and Tortugas when she struck on the quicksands. Maybe her rudder was carried away. Maybe they weren't even steering. But anyway they couldn't have known they were quicksands and when she struck the captain must have ordered them to open up the ballast tanks so she'd lay solid. But it was quicksand she'd hit and when they opened the tank she went in stern first and then over on her beam ends. There were four hundred and fifty passengers and the crew on board of her and they must all have been aboard of her when I found her. They must have opened the tanks as soon as she struck and the minute she settled on it the quicksands took her down. Then her boilers must have burst and that must have been what made those pieces that came out. It was funny there weren't any sharks though. There wasn't a fish. I could have seen them on that clear white sand.

Plenty of fish now though; jewfish, the biggest kind. The biggest part of her's under the sand now but they live inside of her; the biggest kind of jewfish. Some weigh three to four hundred pounds. Sometime we'll go out and get some. You can see the Rebecca light from where she is. They've got a buoy on her now. She's right at the end of the quicksand right at the edge of the gulf. She only missed going through by about a hundred yards. In the dark in the storm they just missed it; raining the way it was they couldn't have seen the Rebecca. Then they're not used to that sort of thing. The captain of a liner isn't used to scudding that way. They have a course and they tell me they set some sort of a compass and it steers itself. They probably didn't know where they were when they ran with that blow but they come close to making it. Maybe they'd lost the rudder though. Anyway there wasn't another thing for them to hit till they'd get to Mexico once they were in that gulf. Must have been something though when they struck in that rain and wind and he told them to open her tanks. Nobody could have been on deck in that blow and rain. Everybody must have been below. They couldn't have lived on deck. There must have been some scenes inside all right because you know she settled fast. I saw that wrench go into the sand. The captain couldn't have known it was quicksand when she struck unless he knew these waters. He just knew it wasn't rock. He must have seen it all up in the bridge. He must have known what it was about when she settled. I wonder how fast she made it. I wonder if the mate was there with him. Do you think they stayed inside the bridge or do you think they took it outside? They never found any bodies. Not a one. Nobody floating. They float a long way with life belts too. They must have took it inside. Well, the Greeks got it all. Everything. They must have come fast all right. They picked her clean. First there was the birds, then me, then the Greeks, and even the birds got more out of her than I did.





A Clean, Well-Lighted Place


It was late and every one had left the café except an old man who sat in the shadow the leaves of the tree made against the electric light. In the day time the street was dusty, but at night the dew settled the dust and the old man liked to sit late because he was deaf and now at night it was quiet and he felt the difference. The two waiters inside the café knew that the old man was a little drunk, and while he was a good client they knew that if he became too drunk he would leave without paying, so they kept watch on him.

“Last week he tried to commit suicide,”one waiter said.

“Why?”

“He was in despair.”

“What about?”

“Nothing.”

“How do you know it was nothing?”

“He has plenty of money.”

They sat together at a table that was close against the wall near the door of the café and looked at the terrace where the tables were all empty except where the old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of the tree that moved slightly in the wind. A girl and a soldier went by in the street. The street light shone on the brass number on his collar. The girl wore no head covering and hurried beside him.

“The guard will pick him up,”one waiter said.

“What does it matter if he gets what he's after?”

“He had better get off the street now. The guard will get him. They went by five minutes ago.”

The old man sitting in the shadow rapped on his saucer with his glass. The younger waiter went over to him.

“What do you want?”

The old man looked at him.“Another brandy,”he said.

“You'll be drunk,”the waiter said. The old man looked at him. The waiter went away.

“He'll stay all night,”he said to his colleague.“I'm sleepy now. I never get into bed before three o'clock. He should have killed himself last week.”

The waiter took the brandy bottle and another saucer from the counter inside the café and marched out to the old man's table. He put down the saucer and poured the glass full of brandy.

“You should have killed yourself last week,”he said to the deaf man. The old man motioned with his finger.“A little more,”he said. The waiter poured on into the glass so that the brandy slopped over and ran down the stem into the top saucer of the pile.“Thank you,”the old man said. The waiter took the bottle back inside the café. He sat down at the table with his colleague again.

“He's drunk now,”he said.

“He's drunk every night.”

“What did he want to kill himself for?”

“How should I know.”

“How did he do it?”

“He hung himself with a rope.”

“Who cut him down?”

“His niece.”

“Why did they do it?”

“Fear for his soul.”

“How much money has he got?”

“He's got plenty.”

“He must be eighty years old.”

“Anyway I should say he was eighty.”

“I wish he would go home. I never get to bed before three o'clock. What kind of hour is that to go to bed?”

“He stays up because he likes it.”

“He's lonely. I'm not lonely. I have a wife waiting in bed for me.”

“He had a wife once too.”

“A wife would be no good to him now.”

“You can't tell. He might be better with a wife.”

“His niece looks after him. You said she cut him down.”

“I know.”

“I wouldn't want to be that old. An old man is a nasty thing.”

“Not always. This old man is clean. He drinks without spilling. Even now, drunk. Look at him.”

“I don't want to look at him. I wish he would go home. He has no regard for those who must work.”

The old man looked from his glass across the square, then over at the waiters.

“Another brandy,”he said, pointing to his glass. The waiter who was in a hurry came over.

“Finished,”he said, speaking with that omission of syntax stupid people employ when talking to drunken people or foreigners.“No more tonight. Close now.”

“Another,”said the old man.

“No. Finished.”The waiter wiped the edge of the table with a towel and shook his head.

The old man stood up, slowly counted the saucers, took a leather coin purse from his pocket and paid for the drinks, leaving half a peseta tip.

The waiter watched him go down the street, a very old man walking unsteadily but with dignity.

“Why didn't you let him stay and drink?”the unhurried waiter asked. They were putting up the shutters.“It is not half-past two.”

“I want to go home to bed.”

“What is an hour?”

“More to me than to him.”

“An hour is the same.”

“You talk like an old man yourself. He can buy a bottle and drink at home.”

“It's not the same.”

“No, it is not,”agreed the waiter with a wife. He did not wish to be unjust. He was only in a hurry.

“And you? You have no fear of going home before your usual hour?”

“Are you trying to insult me?”

“No, hombre, only to make a joke.”

“No,”the waiter who was in a hurry said, rising from pulling down the metal shutters.“I have confidence. I am all confidence.”

“You have youth, confidence, and a job,”the older waiter said.“You have everything.”

“And what do you lack?”

“Everything but work.”

“You have everything I have.”

“No. I have never had confidence and I am not young.”

“Come on. Stop talking nonsense and lock up.”

“I am of those who like to stay late at the café,”the older waiter said.“With all those who do not want to go to bed. With all those who need a light for the night.”

“I want to go home and into bed.”

“We are of two different kinds,”the older waiter said. He was now dressed to go home.“It is not only a question of youth and confidence although those things are very beautiful. Each night I am reluctant to close up because there may be some one who needs the café.”

“Hombre, there are bodegas open all night long.”

“You do not understand. This is a clean and pleasant café. It is well lighted. The light is very good and also, now, there are shadows of the leaves.”

“Good night,”said the younger waiter.

“Good night,”the other said. Turning off the electric light he continued the conversation with himself. It is the light of course but it is necessary that the place be clean and pleasant. You do not want music. Certainly you do not want music. Nor can you stand before a bar with dignity although that is all that is provided for these hours. What did he fear? It was not fear or dread. It was a nothing that he knew too well. It was all a nothing and a man was nothing too. It was only that and light was all it needed and a certain cleanness and order. Some lived in it and never felt it but he knew it all was nada y pues nada y nada y pues nada. Our nada who art in nada, nada be thy name thy kingdom nada thy will be nada in nada as it is in nada. Give us this nada our daily nada and nada us our nada as we nada our nadas and nada us not into nada but deliver us from nada; pues nada. Hail nothing full of nothing, nothing is with thee. He smiled and stood before a bar with a shining steam pressure coffee machine.

“What's yours?”asked the barman.

“Nada.”

“Otro loco más,”said the barman and turned away.

“A little cup,”said the waiter.

The barman poured it for him.

“The light is very bright and pleasant but the bar is unpolished,”the waiter said.

The barman looked at him but did not answer. It was too late at night for conversation.

“You want another copita?”the barman asked.

“No, thank you,”said the waiter and went out. He disliked bars and bodegas. A clean, well-lighted café was a very different thing. Now, without thinking further, he would go home to his room. He would lie in the bed and finally, with daylight, he would go to sleep. After all, he said to himself, it is probably only insomnia. Many must have it.





The Light of the World


When he saw us come in the door the bartender looked up and then reached over and put the glass covers on the two free-lunch bowls.

“Give me a beer,”I said. He drew it, cut the top off with the spatula and then held the glass in his hand. I put the nickel on the wood and he slid the beer toward me.

“What's yours?”he said to Tom.

“Beer.”

He drew that beer and cut it off and when he saw the money he pushed the beer across to Tom.

“What's the matter?”Tom asked.

The bartender didn't answer him. He just looked over our heads and said,“What's yours?”to a man who'd come in.

“Rye,”the man said. The bartender put out the bottle and glass and a glass of water.

Tom reached over and took the glass off the free-lunch bowl. It was a bowl of pickled pig's feet and there was a wooden thing that worked like a scissors, with two wooden forks at the end to pick them up with.

“No,”said the bartender and put the glass cover back on the bowl. Tom held the wooden scissors fork in his hand.“Put it back,”said the bartender.

“You know where,”said Tom.

The bartender reached a hand forward under the bar, watching us both. I put fifty cents on the wood and he straightened up.

“What was yours?”he said.

“Beer,”I said, and before he drew the beer he uncovered both the bowls.

“Your goddam pig's feet stink,”Tom said, and spit what he had in his mouth on the floor. The bartender didn't say anything. The man who had drunk the rye paid and went out without looking back.

“You stink yourself,”the bartender said.“All you punks stink.”

“He says we're punks,”Tommy said to me.

“Listen,”I said.“Let's get out.”

“You punks clear the hell out of here,”the bartender said.

“I said we were going out,”I said.“It wasn't your idea.”

“We'll be back,”Tommy said.

“No you won't,”the bartender told him.

“Tell him how wrong he is,”Tom turned to me.

“Come on,”I said.

Outside it was good and dark.

“What the hell kind of place is this?”Tommy said.

“I don't know,”I said.“Let's go down to the station.”

We'd come in that town at one end and we were going out the other. It smelled of hides and tan bark and the big piles of sawdust. It was getting dark as we came in, and now that it was dark it was cold and the puddles of water in the road were freezing at the edges.

Down at the station there were five whores waiting for the train to come in, and six white men and four Indians. It was crowded and hot from the stove and full of stale smoke. As we came in nobody was talking and the ticket window was down.

“Shut the door, can't you?”somebody said.

I looked to see who said it. It was one of the white men. He wore stagged trousers and lumbermen's rubbers and a mackinaw shirt like the others, but he had no cap and his face was white and his hands were white and thin.

“Aren't you going to shut it?”

“Sure,”I said, and shut it.

“Thank you,”he said. One of the other men snickered.

“Ever interfere with a cook?”he said to me.

“No.”

“You can interfere with this one,”he looked at the cook.“He likes it.”

The cook looked away from him holding his lips tight together.

“He puts lemon juice on his hands,”the man said.“He wouldn't get them in dishwater for anything. Look how white they are.”

One of the whores laughed out loud. She was the biggest whore I ever saw in my life and the biggest woman. And she had on one of those silk dresses that change colors. There were two other whores that were nearly as big but the big one must have weighed three hundred and fifty pounds. You couldn't believe she was real when you looked at her. All three had those changeable silk dresses. They sat side by side on the bench. They were huge. The other two were just ordinary looking whores, peroxide blondes.

“Look at his hands,”the man said and nodded his head at the cook. The whore laughed again and shook all over.

The cook turned and said to her quickly,“You big disgusting mountain of flesh.”

She just keep on laughing and shaking.

“Oh, my Christ,”she said. She had a nice voice.“Oh, my sweet Christ.”

The two other whores, the big ones, acted very quiet and placid as though they didn't have much sense, but they were big, nearly as big as the biggest one. They'd have both gone well over two hundred and fifty pounds. The other two were dignified.

Of the men, besides the cook and the one who talked, there were two other lumberjacks, one that listened, interested but bashful, and the other that seemed getting ready to say something, and two Swedes. Two Indians were sitting down at the end of the bench and one standing up against the wall.

The man who was getting ready to say something spoke to me very low,“Must be like getting on top of a hay mow.”

I laughed and said it to Tommy.

“I swear to Christ I've never been anywhere like this,”he said.“Look at the three of them.”Then the cook spoke up.

“How old are you boys?”

“I'm ninety-six and he's sixty-nine,”Tommy said.

“Ho! Ho! Ho!”the big whore shook with laughing. She had a really pretty voice. The other whores didn't smile.

“Oh, can't you be decent?”the cook said.“I asked just to be friendly.”

“We're seventeen and nineteen,”I said.

“What's the matter with you?”Tommy turned to me.

“That's all right.”

“You can call me Alice,”the big whore said and then she began to shake again.

“Is that your name?”Tommy asked.

“Sure,”she said.“Alice. Isn't it?”she turned to the man who sat by the cook.

“Alice. That's right.”

“That's the sort of name you'd have,”the cook said.

“It's my real name,”Alice said.

“What's the other girls' names?”Tom asked.

“Hazel and Ethel,”Alice said. Hazel and Ethel smiled. They weren't very bright.

“What's your name?”I said to one of the blondes.

“Frances,”she said.

“Frances what?”

“Frances Wilson. What's it to you?”

“What's yours?”I asked the other one.

“Oh, don't be fresh,”she said.

“He just wants us all to be friends,”the man who talked said.“Don't you want to be friends?”

“No,”the peroxide one said.“Not with you.”

“She's just a spitfire,”the man said.“A regular little spitfire.”

The one blonde looked at the other and shook her head.

“Goddamned mossbacks,”she said.

Alice commenced to laugh again and to shake all over.

“There's nothing funny,”the cook said.“You all laugh but there's nothing funny. You two young lads; where are you bound for?”

“Where are you going yourself?”Tom asked him.

“I want to go to Cadillac,”the cook said.“Have you ever been there? My sister lives there.”

“He's a sister himself,”the man in the stagged trousers said.

“Can't you stop that sort of thing?”the cook asked.“Can't we speak decently?”

“Cadillac is where Steve Ketchel came from and where Ad Wolgast is from,”the shy man said.

“Steve Ketchel,”one of the blondes said in a high voice as though the name had pulled a trigger in her.“His own father shot and killed him. Yes, by Christ, his own father. There aren't any more men like Steve Ketchel.”

“Wasn't his name Stanley Ketchel?”asked the cook.

“Oh, shut up,”said the blonde.“What do you know about Steve? Stanley. He was no Stanley. Steve Ketchel was the finest and most beautiful man that ever lived. I never saw a man as clean and as white and as beautiful as Steve Ketchel. There never was a man like that. He moved just like a tiger and he was the finest, free-est spender that ever lived.”

“Did you know him?”one of the men asked.

“Did I know him? Did I know him? Did I love him? You ask me that? I knew him like you know nobody in the world and I loved him like you love God. He was the greatest, finest, whitest, most beautiful man that ever lived, Steve Ketchel, and his own father shot him down like a dog.”

“Were you out on the coast with him?”

“No. I knew him before that. He was the only man I ever loved.”

Every one was very respectful to the peroxide blonde, who said all this in a high stagey way, but Alice was beginning to shake again. I felt it sitting by her.

“You should have married him,”the cook said.

“I wouldn't hurt his career,”the peroxide blonde said.“I wouldn't be a drawback to him. A wife wasn't what he needed. Oh, my God, what a man he was.”

“That was a fine way to look at it,”the cook said.“Didn't Jack Johnson knock him out though?”

“It was a trick,”Peroxide said.“That big dinge took him by surprise. He'd just knocked Jack Johnson down, the big black bastard. That nigger beat him by a fluke.”

The ticket window went up and the three Indians went over to it.

“Steve knocked him down,”Peroxide said.“He turned to smile at me.”

“I thought you said you weren't on the coast,”some one said.

“I went out just for that fight. Steve turned to smile at me and that black son of a bitch from hell jumped up and hit him by surprise. Steve could lick a hundred like that black bastard.”

“He was a great fighter,”the lumberjack said.

“I hope to God he was,”Peroxide said.“I hope to God they don't have fighters like that now. He was like a god, he was. So white and clean and beautiful and smooth and fast and like a tiger or like lightning.”

“I saw him in the moving pictures of the fight,”Tom said. We were all very moved. Alice was shaking all over and I looked and saw she was crying. The Indians had gone outside on the platform.

“He was more than any husband could ever be,”Peroxide said.“We were married in the eyes of God and I belong to him right now and always will and all of me is his. I don't care about my body. They can take my body. My soul belongs to Steve Ketchel. By God, he was a man.”

Everybody felt terribly. It was sad and embarrassing. Then Alice, who was still shaking, spoke.“You're a dirty liar,”she said in that low voice.“You never laid Steve Ketchel in your life and you know it.”

“How can you say that?”Peroxide said proudly.

“I say it because it's true,”Alice said.“I'm the only one here that ever knew Steve Ketchel and I come from Mancelona and I knew him there and it's true and you know it's true and God can strike me dead if it isn't true.”

“He can strike me too,”Peroxide said.

“This is true, true, true, and you know it. Not just made up and I know exactly what he said to me.”

“What did he say?”Peroxide asked, complacently.

Alice was crying so she could hardly speak from shaking so.“He said‘You're a lovely piece, Alice.’That's exactly what he said.”

“It's a lie,”Peroxide said.

“It's true,”Alice said.“That's truly what he said.”

“It's a lie,”Peroxide said proudly.

“No, it's true, true, true, to Jesus and Mary true.”

“Steve couldn't have said that. It wasn't the way he talked,”Peroxide said happily.

“It's true,”said Alice in her nice voice.“And it doesn't make any difference to me whether you believe it or not.”She wasn't crying any more and she was calm.

“It would be impossible for Steve to have said that,”Peroxide declared.

“He said it,”Alice said and smiled.“And I remember when he said it and I was a lovely piece then exactly as he said, and right now I'm a better piece than you, you dried up old hot-water bottle.”

“You can't insult me,”said Peroxide.“You big mountain of pus. I have my memories.”

“No,”Alice said in that sweet lovely voice,“you haven't got any real memories except having your tubes out and when you started C. and M. Everything else you just read in the papers. I'm clean and you know it and men like me, even though I'm big, and you know it, and I never lie and you know it.”

“Leave me with my memories,”Peroxide said.“With my true, wonderful memories.”

Alice looked at her and then at us and her face lost that hurt look and she smiled and she had about the prettiest face I ever saw. She had a pretty face and a nice smooth skin and a lovely voice and she was nice all right and really friendly. But my God she was big. She was as big as three women. Tom saw me looking at her and he said,“Come on. Let's go.”

“Good-bye,”said Alice. She certainly had a nice voice.

“Good-bye,”I said.

“Which way are you boys going?”asked the cook.

“The other way from you,”Tom told him.





God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen


In those days the distances were all very different, the dirt blew off the hills that now have been cut down, and Kansas City was very like Constantinople. You may not believe this. No one believes this; but it is true. On this afternoon it was snowing and inside an automobile dealer's show window, lighted against the early dark, there was a racing motor car finished entirely in silver with Dans Argent lettered on the hood. This I believed to mean the silver dance or the silver dancer, and, slightly puzzled which it meant but happy in the sight of the car and pleased by my knowledge of a foreign language, I went along the street in the snow. I was walking from the Woolf Brothers' saloon where, on Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, a free turkey dinner was served, toward the city hospital which was on a high hill that overlooked the smoke, the buildings and the streets of the town. In the reception room of the hospital were the two ambulance surgeons Doc Fischer and Doctor Wilcox, sitting, the one before a desk, the other in a chair against the wall.

Doc Fischer was thin, sand-blond, with a thin mouth, amused eyes and gambler's hands. Doctor Wilcox was short, dark and carried an indexed book, The Young Doctor's Friend and Guide, which, being consulted on any given subject, told symptoms and treatment. It was also cross-indexed so that being consulted on symptoms it gave diagnoses. Doc Fischer had suggested that any future editions should be further cross-indexed so that if consulted as to the treatments being given, it would reveal ailments and symptoms.“As an aid to memory,”he said.

Doctor Wilcox was sensitive about this book but could not get along without it. It was bound in limp leather and fitted his coat pocket and he had bought it at the advice of one of his professors who had said,“Wilcox, you have no business being a physician and I have done everything in my power to prevent you from being certified as one. Since you are now a member of this learned profession I advise you, in the name of humanity, to obtain a copy of The Young Doctor's Friend and Guide, and use it, Doctor Wilcox. Learn to use it.”

Doctor Wilcox had said nothing but he had bought the leather-bound guide that same day.

“Well, Horace,”Doc Fischer said as I came in the receiving room which smelt of cigarettes, iodoform, carbolic and an overheated radiator.

“Gentlemen,”I said.

“What news along the rialto?”Doc Fischer asked. He affected a certain extravagance of speech which seemed to me to be of the utmost elegance.

“The free turkey at Woolf's,”I answered.

“You partook?”

“Copiously.”

“Many of the confrères present?”

“All of them. The whole staff.”

“Much Yuletide cheer?”

“Not much.”

“Doctor Wilcox here has partaken slightly,”Doc Fischer said. Doctor Wilcox looked up at him, then at me.

“Want a drink?”he asked.

“No, thanks,”I said.

“That's all right,”Doctor Wilcox said.

“Horace,”Doc Fischer said,“you don't mind me calling you Horace, do you?”

“No.”

“Good old Horace. We've had an extremely interesting case.”

“I'll say,”said Doctor Wilcox.

“You know the lad who was in here yesterday?”

“Which one?”

“The lad who sought eunuch-hood.”

“Yes.”I had been there when he came in. He was a boy about sixteen. He came in with no hat on and was very excited and frightened but determined. He was curly haired and well built and his lips were prominent.

“What's the matter with you, son?”Doctor Wilcox asked him.“I want to be castrated,”the boy said.

“Why?”Doc Fischer asked.

“I've prayed and I've done everything and nothing helps.”

“Helps what?”

“That awful lust.”

“What awful lust?”

“The way I get. The way I can't stop getting. I pray all night about it.”

“Just what happens?”Doc Fischer asked.

The boy told him.“Listen, boy,”Doc Fischer said.“There's nothing wrong with you. That's the way you're supposed to be. There's nothing wrong with that.”

“It is wrong,”said the boy.“It's a sin against purity. It's a sin against our Lord and Saviour.”

“No,”said Doc Fisher.“It's a natural thing. It's the way you are supposed to be and later on you will think you are very fortunate.”

“Oh, you don't understand,”the boy said.

“Listen,”Doc Fischer said and he told the boy certain things.

“No. I won't listen. You can't make me listen.”

“Please listen,”Doc Fischer said.

“You're just a goddamned fool,”Doctor Wilcox said to the boy.

“Then you won't do it?”the boy asked.

“Do what?”

“Castrate me.”

“Listen,”Doc Fischer said.“No one will castrate you. There is nothing wrong with your body. You have a fine body and you must not think about that. If you are religious remember that what you complain of is no sinful state but the means of consummating a sacrament.”

“I can't stop it happening,”the boy said.“I pray all night and I pray in the daytime. It is a sin, a constant sin against purity.”

“Oh, go and—”Doctor Wilcox said.

“When you talk like that I don't hear you,”the boy said with dignity to Doctor Wilcox.“Won't you please do it?”he asked Doc Fischer.

“No,”said Doc Fischer.“I've told you, boy.”

“Get him out of here,”Doctor Wilcox said.

“I'll get out,”the boy said.“Don't touch me. I'll get out.”

That was about five o'clock on the day before.

“So what happened?”I asked.

“So at one o'clock this morning,”Doc Fischer said,“we receive the youth self-mutilated with a razor.”

“Castrated?”

“No,”said Doc Fisher.“He didn't know what castrate meant.”

“He may die,”Doctor Wilcox said.

“Why?”

“Loss of blood.”

“The good physician here. Doctor Wilcox, my colleague, was on call and he was unable to find this emergency listed in his book.”

“The hell with you talking that way,”Doctor Wilcox said.

“I only mean it in the friendliest way, Doctor,”Doc Fischer said, looking at his hands, at his hands that had, with his willingness to oblige and his lack of respect for Federal statutes, made him his trouble.“Horace here will bear me out that I only speak of it in the very friendliest way. It was an amputation the young man performed, Horace.”

“Well, I wish you wouldn't ride me about it,”Doctor Wilcox said.“There isn't any need to ride me.”

“Ride you, Doctor, on the day, the very anniversary, of our Saviour's birth?”

“Our Saviour? Ain't you a Jew?”Doctor Wilcox said.

“So I am. So I am. It always is slipping my mind. I've never given it its proper importance. So good of you to remind me. Your Saviour. That's right. Your Saviour, undoubtedly your Saviour—and the ride for Palm Sunday.”

“You're too damned smart,”Doctor Wilcox said.

“An excellent diagnosis, Doctor. I was always too damned smart. Too damned smart on the coast certainly. Avoid it, Horace. You haven't much tendency but sometimes I see a gleam. But what a diagnosis—and without the book.”

“The hell with you,”Doctor Wilcox said.

“All in good time, Doctor,”Doc Fischer said.“All in good time. If there is such a place I shall certainly visit it. I have even had a very small look into it. No more than a peek, really. I looked away almost at once. And do you know what the young man said, Horace, when the good Doctor here brought him in? He said,‘Oh, I asked you to do it. I asked you so many times to do it.’”

“On Christmas Day, too,”Doctor Wilcox said.

“The significance of the particular day is not important,”Doc Fischer said.

“Maybe not to you,”said Doctor Wilcox.

“You hear him, Horace?”Doc Fischer said.“You hear him? Having discovered my vulnerable point, my achilles tendon so to speak, the doctor pursues his advantage.”

“You're too damned smart,”Doctor Wilcox said.





A Way You'll Never Be


The attack had gone across the field, been held up by machine-gun fire from the sunken road and from the group of farm houses, encountered no resistance in the town, and reached the bank of the river. Coming along the road on a bicycle, getting off to push the machine when the surface of the road became too broken, Nicholas Adams saw what had happened by the position of the dead.

They lay alone or in clumps in the high grass of the field and along the road, their pockets out, and over them were flies and around each body or group of bodies were the scattered papers.

In the grass and the grain, beside the road, and in some places scattered over the road, there was much material: a field kitchen, it must have come over when things were going well; many of the calf-skin-covered haversacks, stick bombs, helmets, rifles, sometimes one butt-up, the bayonet stuck in the dirt, they had dug quite a little at the last; stick bombs, helmets, rifles, in trenching tools, ammunition boxes, star-shell pistols, their shells scattered about, medical kits, gas masks, empty gas-mask cans, a squat, tripodded machine gun in a nest of empty shells, full belts protruding from the boxes, the water-cooling can empty and on its side, the breech block gone, the crew in odd positions, and around them, in the grass, more of the typical papers.

There were mass prayer books, group postcards showing the machine-gun unit standing in ranked and ruddy cheerfulness as in a football picture for a college annual; now they were humped and swollen in the grass; propaganda postcards showing a soldier in Austrian uniform bending a woman backward over a bed; the figures were impressionistically drawn; very attractively depicted and had nothing in common with actual rape in which the woman's skirts are pulled over her head to smother her, one comrade sometimes sitting upon the head. There were many of these inciting cards which had evidently been issued just before the offensive. Now they were scattered with the smutty postcards, photographic; the small photographs of village girls by village photographers, the occasional pictures of children, and the letters, letters, letters. There was always much paper about the dead and the débris of this attack was no exception.

These were new dead and no one had bothered with anything but their pockets. Our own dead, or what he thought of, still, as our own dead, were surprisingly few, Nick noticed. Their coats had been opened too and their pockets were out, and they showed, by their positions, the manner and the skill of the attack. The hot weather had swollen them all alike regardless of nationality.

The town had evidently been defended, at the last, from the line of the sunken road and there had been few or no Austrians to fall back into it. There were only three bodies in the street and they looked to have been killed running. The houses of the town were broken by the shelling and the street had much rubble of plaster and mortar and there were broken beams, broken tiles, and many holes, some of them yellow-edged from the mustard gas. There were many pieces of shell, and shrapnel balls were scattered in the rubble. There was no one in the town at all.

Nick Adams had seen no one since he had left Fornaci, although, riding along the road through the over-foliaged country, he had seen guns hidden under screens of mulberry leaves to the left of the road, noticing them by the heat-waves in the air above the leaves where the sun hit the metal. Now he went on through the town, surprised to find it deserted, and came out on the low road beneath the bank of the river. Leaving the town there was a bare open space where the road slanted down and he could see the placid reach of the river and the low curve of the opposite bank and the whitened, sun-baked mud where the Austrians had dug. It was all very lush and over-green since he had seen it last and becoming historical had made no change in this, the lower river.

The battalion was along the bank to the left. There was a series of holes in the top of the bank with a few men in them. Nick noticed where the machine guns were posted and the signal rockets in their racks. The men in the holes in the side of the bank were sleeping. No one challenged. He went on and as he came around a turn in the mud bank a young second lieutenant with a stubble of beard and red-rimmed, very blood-shot eyes pointed a pistol at him.

“Who are you?”

Nick told him.

“How do I know this?”

Nick showed him the tessera with photograph and identification and the seal of the third army. He took hold of it.

“I will keep this.”

“You will not,”Nick said.“Give me back the card and put your gun away. There. In the holster.”

“How am I to know who you are?”

“The tessera tells you.”

“And if the tessera is false? Give me that card.”

“Don't be a fool,”Nick said cheerfully.“Take me to your company commander.”

“I should send you to battalion headquarters.”

“All right,”said Nick.“Listen, do you know the Captain Paravicini? The tall one with the small mustache who was an architect and speaks English?”

“You know him?”

“A little.”

“What company does he command?”

“The second.”

“He is commanding the battalion.”

“Good,”said Nick. He was relieved to know that Para was all right.“Let us go to the battalion.”

As Nick had left the edge of the town three shrapnel had burst high and to the right over one of the wrecked houses and since then there had been no shelling. But the face of this officer looked like the face of a man during a bombardment. There was the same tightness and the voice did not sound natural. His pistol made Nick nervous.

“Put it away,”he said.“There's the whole river between them and you.”

“If I thought you were a spy I would shoot you now,”the second lieutenant said.

“Come on,”said Nick.“Let us go to the battalion.”This officer made him very nervous.

The Captain Paravicini, acting major, thinner and more English-looking than ever, rose when Nick saluted from behind the table in the dugout that was battalion headquarters.

“Hello,”he said.“I didn't know you. What are you doing in that uniform?”

“They've put me in it.”

“I am very glad to see you, Nicolo.”

“Right. You look well. How was the show?”

“We made a very fine attack. Truly. A very fine attack. I will show you. Look.”

He showed on the map how the attack had gone.

“I came from Fornaci,”Nick said.“I could see how it had been. It was very good.”

“It was extraordinary. Altogether extraordinary. Are you attached to the regiment?”

“No. I am supposed to move around and let them see the uniform.”

“How odd.”

“If they see one American uniform that is supposed to make them believe others are coming.”

“But how will they know it is an American uniform?”“You will tell them.”

“Oh. Yes, I see. I will send a corporal with you to show you about and you will make a tour of the lines.”

“Like a bloody politician,”Nick said.

“You would be much more distinguished in civilian clothes. They are what is really distinguished.”

“With a homburg hat,”said Nick.

“Or with a very furry fedora.”

“I'm supposed to have my pockets full of cigarettes and postal cards and such things,”Nick said.“I should have a musette full of chocolate. These I should distribute with a kind word and a pat on the back. But there weren't any cigarettes and postcards and no chocolate. So they said to circulate around anyway.”

“I'm sure your appearance will be very heartening to the troops.”

“I wish you wouldn't,”Nick said.“I feel badly enough about it as it is. In principle, I would have brought you a bottle of brandy.”

“In principle,”Para said and smiled, for the first time, showing yellowed teeth.“Such a beautiful expression. Would you like some grappa?”

“No, thank you,”Nick said.

“It hasn't any ether in it.”

“I can taste that still,”Nick remembered suddenly and completely.

“You know I never knew you were drunk until you started talking coming back in the camions.”

“I was stinking in every attack,”Nick said.

“I can't do it,”Para said.“I took it in the first show, the very first show, and it only made me very upset and then frightfully thirsty.”

“You don't need it.”

“You're much braver in an attack than I am.”

“No,”Nick said.“I know how I am and I prefer to get stinking. I'm not ashamed of it.”

“I've never seen you drunk.”

“No?”said Nick.“Never? Not when we rode from Mestre to Portogrande that night and I wanted to go to sleep and used the bicycle for a blanket and pulled it up under my chin?”

“That wasn't in the lines.”

“Let's not talk about how I am,”Nick said.“It's a subject I know too much about to want to think about it any more.”

“You might as well stay here a while,”Paravicini said.“You can take a nap if you like. They didn't do much to this in the bombardment. It's too hot to go out yet.”

“I suppose there is no hurry.”

“How are you really?”

“I'm fine. I'm perfectly all right.”

“No. I mean really.”

“I'm all right. I can't sleep without a light of some sort. That's all I have now.”

“I said it should have been trepanned. I'm no doctor but I know that.”

“Well, they thought it was better to have it absorb, and that's what I got. What's the matter? I don't seem crazy to you, do I?”

“You seem in top-hole shape.”

“It's a hell of a nuisance once they've had you certified as nutty,”Nick said.“No one ever has any confidence in you again.”

“I would take a nap, Nicolo,”Paravicini said.“This isn't battalion headquarters as we used to know it. We're just waiting to be pulled out. You oughtn't to go out in the heat now—it's silly. Use that bunk.”

“I might just lie down,”Nick said.

Nick lay on the bunk. He was very disappointed that he felt this way and more disappointed, even, that it was so obvious to Captain Paravicini. This was not as large a dugout as the one where that platoon of the class of 1899, just out at the front, got hysterics during the bombardment before the attack, and Para had had him walk them two at a time outside to show them nothing would happen, he wearing his own chin strap tight across his mouth to keep his lips quiet. Knowing they could not hold it when they took it. Knowing it was all a bloody balls—if he can't stop crying, break his nose to give him something else to think about. I'd shoot one but it's too late now. They'd all be worse. Break his nose. They've put it back to five-twenty. We've only got four minutes more. Break that other silly bugger's nose and kick his silly ass out of here. Do you think they'll go over? If they don't, shoot two and try to scoop the others out some way. Keep behind them, sergeant. It's no use to walk ahead and find there's nothing coming behind you. Bail them out as you go. What a bloody balls. All right. That's right. Then, looking at the watch, in that quiet tone, that valuable quiet tone,“Savoia.”Making it cold, no time to get it, he couldn't find his own after the cave-in, one whole end had caved in; it was that started them; making it cold up that slope the only time he hadn't done it stinking. And after they came back the teleferica house burned, it seemed, and some of the wounded got down four days later and some did not get down, but we went up and we went back and we came down—we always came down. And there was Gaby Delys, oddly enough, with feathers on; you called me baby doll a year ago tadada you said that I was rather nice to know tadada with feathers on, with feathers off, the great Gaby, and my name's Harry Pilcer, too, we used to step out of the far side of the taxis when it got steep going up the hill and he could see that hill every night when he dreamed with Sacré Coeur, blown white, like a soap bubble. Sometimes his girl was there and sometimes she was with some one else and he could not understand that, but those were the nights the river ran so much wider and stiller than it should and outside of Fossalta there was a low house painted yellow with willows all around it and a low stable and there was a canal, and he had been there a thousand times and never seen it, but there it was every night as plain as the hill, only it frightened him. That house meant more than anything and every night he had it. That was what he needed but it frightened him especially when the boat lay there quietly in the willows on the canal, but the banks weren't like this river. It was all lower, as it was at Portogrande, where they had seen them come wallowing across the flooded ground holding the rifles high until they fell with them in the water. Who ordered that one? If it didn't get so damned mixed up he could follow it all right. That was why he noticed everything in such detail to keep it all straight so he would know just where he was, but suddenly it confused without reason as now, he lying in a bunk at battalion headquarters, with Para commanding a battalion and he in a bloody American uniform. He sat up and looked around; they all watching him. Para was gone out. He lay down again.

The Paris part came earlier and he was not frightened of it except when she had gone off with some one else and the fear that they might take the same driver twice. That was what frightened about that. Never about the front. He never dreamed about the front now any more but what frightened him so that he could not get rid of it was that long yellow house and the different width of the river. Now he was back here at the river, he had gone through that same town, and there was no house. Nor was the river that way. Then where did he go each night and what was the peril, and why would he wake, soaking wet, more frightened than he had ever been in a bombardment, because of a house and a long stable and a canal?

He sat up; swung his legs carefully down; they stiffened any time they were out straight for long; returned the stares of the adjutant, the signallers and the two runners by the door and put on his cloth-covered trench helmet.

“I regret the absence of the chocolate, the postal cards and cigarettes,”he said.“I am, however, wearing the uniform.”

“The major is coming back at once,”the adjutant said. In that army an adjutant is not a commissioned officer.

“The uniform is not very correct,”Nick told them.“But it gives you the idea. There will be several millions of Americans here shortly.”

“Do you think they will send Americans down here?”asked the adjutant.

“Oh, absolutely. Americans twice as large as myself, healthy, with clean hearts, sleep at night, never been wounded, never been blown up, never had their heads caved in, never been scared, don't drink, faithful to the girls they left behind them, many of them never had crabs, wonderful chaps. You'll see.”

“Are you an Italian?”asked the adjutant.

“No, American. Look at the uniform. Spagnolini made it but it's not quite correct.”

“A North or South American?”

“North,”said Nick. He felt it coming on now. He would quiet down.

“But you speak Italian.”

“Why not? Do you mind if I speak Italian? Haven't I a right to speak Italian?”

“You have Italian medals.”

“Just the ribbons and the papers. The medals come later. Or you give them to people to keep and the people go away; or they are lost with your baggage. You can purchase others in Milan. It is the papers that are of importance. You must not feel badly about them. You will have some yourself if you stay at the front long enough.”

“I am a veteran of the Eritrea campaign,”said the adjutant stiffly.“I fought in Tripoli.”

“It's quite something to have met you,”Nick put out his hand.“Those must have been trying days. I noticed the ribbons. Were you, by any chance, on the Carso?”

“I have just been called up for this war. My class was too old.”

“At one time I was under the age limit,”Nick said.“But now I am reformed out of the war.”

“But why are you here now?”

“I am demonstrating the American uniform,”Nick said.“Don't you think it is very significant? It is a little tight in the collar but soon you will see untold millions wearing this uniform swarming like locusts. The grasshopper, you know, what we call the grasshopper in America, is really a locust. The true grasshopper is small and green and comparatively feeble. You must not, however, make a confusion with the seven-year locust or cicada which emits a peculiar sustained sound which at the moment I cannot recall. I try to recall it but I cannot. I can almost hear it and then it is quite gone. You will pardon me if I break off our conversation?”

“See if you can find the major,”the adjutant said to one of the two runners.“I can see you have been wounded,”he said to Nick.

“In various places,”Nick said.“If you are interested in scars I can show you some very interesting ones but I would rather talk about grasshoppers. What we call grasshoppers that is; and what are, really, locusts. These insects at one time played a very important part in my life. It might interest you and you can look at the uniform while I am talking.”

The adjutant made a motion with his hand to the second runner who went out.

“Fix your eyes on the uniform. Spagnolini made it, you know. You might as well look, too,”Nick said to the signallers.“I really have no rank. We're under the American consul. It's perfectly all right for you to look. You can stare, if you like. I will tell you about the American locust. We always preferred one that we called the medium-brown. They last the best in the water and fish prefer them. The larger ones that fly making a noise somewhat similar to that produced by a rattlesnake rattling his rattlers, a very dry sound, have vivid colored wings, some are bright red, others yellow barred with black, but their wings go to pieces in the water and they make a very blowsy bait, while the medium-brown is a plump, compact, succulent hopper that I can recommend as far as one may well recommend something you gentlemen will probably never encounter. But I must insist that you will never gather a sufficient supply of these insects for a day's fishing by pursuing them with your hands or trying to hit them with a bat. That is sheer nonsense and a useless waste of time. I repeat, gentlemen, that you will get nowhere at it. The correct procedure, and one which should be taught all young officers at every small-arms course if I had anything to say about it, and who knows but what I will have, is the employment of a seine or net made of common mosquito netting. Two officers holding this length of netting at alternate ends, or let us say one at each end, stoop, hold the bottom extremity of the net in one hand and the top extremity in the other and run into the wind. The hoppers, flying with the wind, fly against the length of netting and are imprisoned in its folds. It is no trick at all to catch a very great quantity indeed, and no officer, in my opinion, should be without a length of mosquito netting suitable for the improvisation of one of these grasshopper seines. I hope I have made myself clear, gentlemen. Are there any questions? If there is anything in the course you do not understand please ask questions. Speak up. None? Then I would like to close on this note. In the words of that great soldier and gentleman, Sir Henry Wilson: Gentlemen, either you must govern or you must be governed. Let me repeat it. Gentlemen, there is one thing I would like to have you remember. One thing I would like you to take with you as you leave this room. Gentlemen, either you must govern—or you must be governed. That is all, gentlemen. Good-day.”

He removed his cloth-covered helmet, put it on again and, stooping, went out the low entrance of the dugout. Para, accompanied by the two runners, was coming down the line of the sunken road. It was very hot in the sun and Nick removed the helmet.

“There ought to be a system for wetting these things,”he said.“I shall wet this one in the river.”He started up the bank.

“Nicolo,”Paravicini called.“Nicolo. Where are you going?”

“I don't really have to go.”Nick came down the slope, holding the helmet in his hands.“They're a damned nuisance wet or dry. Do you wear yours all the time?”

“All the time,”said Para.“It's making me bald. Come inside.”

Inside Para told him to sit down.

“You know they're absolutely no damned good,”Nick said.“I remember when they were a comfort when we first had them, but I've seen them full of brains too many times.”

“Nicolo,”Para said.“I think you should go back. I think it would be better if you didn't come up to the line until you had those supplies. There's nothing here for you to do. If you move around, even with something worth giving away, the men will group and that invites shelling. I won't have it.”

“I know it's silly,”Nick said.“It wasn't my idea. I heard the brigade was here so I thought I would see you or some one else I knew. I could have gone to Zenzon or to San Dona. I'd like to go to San Dona to see the bridge again.”

“I won't have you circulating around to no purpose,”Captain Paravicini said.

“All right,”said Nick. He felt it coming on again.

“You understand?”

“Of course,”said Nick. He was trying to hold it in.

“Anything of that sort should be done at night.”

“Naturally,”said Nick. He knew he could not stop it now.

“You see, I am commanding the battalion,”Para said.

“And why shouldn't you be?”Nick said. Here it came.“You can read and write, can't you?”

“Yes,”said Para gently.

“The trouble is you have a damned small battalion to command. As soon as it gets to strength again they'll give you back your company. Why don't they bury the dead? I've seen them now. I don't care about seeing them again. They can bury them any time as far as I'm concerned and it would be much better for you. You'll all get bloody sick.”

“Where did you leave your bicycle?”

“Inside the last house.”

“Do you think it will be all right?”

“Don't worry,”Nick said.“I'll go in a little while.”

“Lie down a little while, Nicolo.”

“All right.”

He shut his eyes, and in place of the man with the beard who looked at him over the sights of the rifle, quite calmly before squeezing off, the white flash and clublike impact, on his knees, hot-sweet choking, coughing it onto the rock while they went past him, he saw a long, yellow house with a low stable and the river much wider than it was and stiller.“Christ,”he said,“I might as well go.”

He stood up.

“I'm going, Para,”he said.“I'll ride back now in the afternoon. If any supplies have come I'll bring them down tonight. If not I'll come at night when I have something to bring.”

“It is still hot to ride,”Captain Paravicini said.

“You don't need to worry,”Nick said.“I'm all right now for quite a while. I had one then but it was easy. They're getting much better. I can tell when I'm going to have one because I talk so much.”

“I'll send a runner with you.”

“I'd rather you didn't. I know the way.”

“You'll be back soon?”

“Absolutely.”

“Let me send—”

“No,”said Nick.“As a mark of confidence.”

“Well, ciao then.”

“Ciao,”said Nick. He started back along the sunken road toward where he had left the bicycle. In the afternoon the road would be shady once he had passed the canal. Beyond that there were trees on both sides that had not been shelled at all. It was on that stretch that, marching, they had once passed the Terza Savoia cavalry regiment riding in the snow with their lances. The horses' breath made plumes in the cold air. No, that was somewhere else. Where was that?

“I'd better get to that damned bicycle,”Nick said to himself.“I don't want to lose the way to Fornaci.”





Homage to Switzerland





PART I　PORTRAIT OF MR. WHEELER IN MONTREUX


Inside the station café it was warm and light. The wood of the tables shone from wiping and there were baskets of pretzels in glazed paper sacks. The chairs were carved, but the seats were worn and comfortable. There was a carved wooden clock on the wall and a bar at the far end of the room. Outside the window it was snowing.

Two of the station porters sat drinking new wine at the table under the clock. Another porter came in and said the Simplon-Orient Express was an hour late at Saint-Maurice. He went out. The waitress came over to Mr. Wheeler's table.

“The Express is an hour late, sir,”she said.“Can I bring you some coffee?”

“If you think it won't keep me awake.”

“Please?”asked the waitress.

“Bring me some,”said Mr. Wheeler.

“Thank you.”

She brought the coffee from the kitchen and Mr. Wheeler looked out the window at the snow falling in the light from the station platform.

“Do you speak other languages besides English?”he asked the waitress.

“Oh, yes, sir. I speak German and French and the dialects.”

“Would you like a drink of something?”

“Oh, no, sir. It is not permitted to drink in the café with the clients.”

“You won't take a cigar?”

“Oh, no, sir. I don't smoke, sir.”

“That is all right,”said Mr. Wheeler. He looked out of the window again, drank the coffee, and lit a cigarette.

“Fräulein,”he called. The waitress came over.

“What would you like, sir?”

“You,”he said.

“You must not joke me like that.”

“I'm not joking.”

“Then you must not say it.”

“I haven't time to argue,”Mr. Wheeler said.“The train comes in forty minutes. If you'll go upstairs with me I'll give you a hundred francs.”

“You should not say such things, sir. I will ask the porter to speak with you.”

“I don't want a porter,”Mr. Wheeler said.“Nor a policeman nor one of those boys that sell cigarettes. I want you.”

“If you talk like that you must go out. You cannot stay here and talk like that.”

“Why don't you go away, then? If you go away I can't talk to you.”

The waitress went away. Mr. Wheeler watched to see if she spoke to the porters. She did not.

“Mademoiselle!”he called. The waitress came over.“Bring me a bottle of Sion, please.”

“Yes, sir.”

Mr. Wheeler watched her go out, then come in with the wine and bring it to his table. He looked toward the clock.

“I'll give you two hundred francs,”he said.

“Please do not say such things.”

“Two hundred francs is a great deal of money.”

“You will not say such things!”the waitress said. She was losing her English. Mr. Wheeler looked at her interestedly.

“Two hundred francs.”

“You are hateful.”

“Why don't you go away then? I can't talk to you if you're not here.”

The waitress left the table and went over to the bar. Mr. Wheeler drank the wine and smiled to himself for some time.

“Mademoiselle,”he called. The waitress pretended not to hear him.“Mademoiselle,”he called again. The waitress came over.

“You wish something?”

“Very much. I'll give you three hundred francs.”

“You are hateful.”

“Three hundred francs Swiss.”

She went away and Mr. Wheeler looked after her. A porter opened the door. He was the one who had Mr. Wheeler's bags in his charge.

“The train is coming, sir,”he said in French. Mr. Wheeler stood up.

“Mademoiselle,”he called. The waitress came toward the table.“How much is the wine?”

“Seven francs.”

Mr. Wheeler counted out eight francs and left them on the table. He put on his coat and followed the porter onto the platform where the snow was falling.

“Au revoir, Mademoiselle,”he said. The waitress watched him go. He's ugly, she thought, ugly and hateful. Three hundred francs for a thing that is nothing to do. How many times have I done that for nothing. And no place to go here. If he had sense he would know there was no place. No time and no place to go. Three hundred francs to do that. What people those Americans.

Standing on the cement platform beside his bags, looking down the rails toward the headlight of the train coming through the snow, Mr. Wheeler was thinking that it was very inexpensive sport. He had only spent, actually, aside from the dinner, seven francs for a bottle of wine and a franc for the tip. Seventy-five centimes would have been better. He would have felt better now if the tip had been seventy-five centimes. One franc Swiss is five francs French. Mr. Wheeler was headed for Paris. He was very careful about money and did not care for women. He had been in that station before and he knew there was no upstairs to go to. Mr. Wheeler never took chances.





PART II　MR. JOHNSON TALKS ABOUT IT AT VEVEY


Inside the station café it was warm and light; the tables were shiny from wiping and on some there were red and white striped table cloths; and there were blue and white striped table cloths on the others and on all of them baskets with pretzels in glazed paper sacks. The chairs were carved but the wood seats were worn and comfortable. There was a clock on the wall, a zinc bar at the far end of the room, and outside the window it was snowing. Two of the station porters sat drinking new wine at the table under the clock.

Another porter came in and said the Simplon-Orient Express was an hour late at Saint-Maurice. The waitress came over to Mr. Johnson's table.

“The Express is an hour late, sir,”she said.“Can I bring you some coffee?”

“If it's not too much trouble.”

“Please?”asked the waitress.

“I'll take some.”

“Thank you.”

She brought the coffee from the kitchen and Mr. Johnson looked out the window at the snow falling in the light from the station platform.

“Do you speak other languages besides English?”he asked the waitress.

“Oh, yes, I speak German and French and the dialects.”

“Would you like a drink of something?”

“Oh, no, sir. It is not permitted to drink in the café with the clients.”

“Have a cigar?”

“Oh, no, sir,”she laughed.“I don't smoke, sir.”

“Neither do I,”said Johnson.“It's a dirty habit.”

The waitress went away and Johnson lit a cigarette and drank the coffee. The clock on the wall marked a quarter to ten. His watch was a little fast. The train was due at ten-thirty—an hour late meant eleven-thirty. Johnson called to the waitress.

“Signorina!”

“What would you like, sir?”

“You wouldn't like to play with me?”Johnson asked. The waitress blushed.

“No, sir.”

“I don't mean anything violent. You wouldn't like to make up a party and see the night life of Vevey? Bring a girl friend if you like.”

“I must work,”the waitress said.“I have my duty here.”

“I know,”said Johnson.“But couldn't you get a substitute? They used to do that in the Civil War.”

“Oh, no, sir. I must be here myself in the person.”

“Where did you learn your English?”

“At the Berlitz school, sir.”

“Tell me about it,”Johnson said.“Were the Berlitz undergraduates a wild lot? What about all this necking and petting? Were there many smoothies? Did you ever run into Scott Fitzgerald?”

“Please?”

“I mean were your college days the happiest days of your life? What sort of team did Berlitz have last fall?”

“You are joking, sir?”

“Only feebly,”said Johnson.“You're an awfully good girl. And you don't want to play with me?”

“Oh, no, sir,”said the waitress.“Would you like me to bring you something?”

“Yes,”said Johnson.“Would you bring me the wine list?”

“Yes, sir.”

Johnson walked over with the wine list to the table where the three porters sat. They looked up at him. They were old men.

“Wollen Sie trinken?”he asked. One of them nodded and smiled.

“Oui, monsieur.”

“You speak French?”

“Oui, monsieur.”

“What shall we drink? Connais-vous des champagnes?”

“Non, monsieur.”

“Faut les connaître,”said Johnson.“Fräulein,”he called the waitress.“We will drink champagne.”

“Which champagne would you prefer, sir?”

“The best,”said Johnson.“Laquelle est le best?”he asked the porters.

“Le meilleur?”asked the porter who had spoken first.

“By all means.”

The porter took out a pair of gold-rimmed glasses from his coat pocket and looked over the list. He ran his finger down the four typewritten names and prices.

“Sportsman,”he said.“Sportsman is the best.”

“You agree, gentlemen?”Johnson asked the other porters. The one porter nodded. The other said in French,“I don't know them personally but I've often heard speak of Sportsman. It's good.”

“A bottle of Sportsman,”Johnson said to the waitress. He looked at the price on the wine card: eleven francs Swiss.“Make it two Sportsmen. Do you mind if I sit here with you?”he asked the porter who had suggested Sportsman.

“Sit down. Put yourself here, please.”The porter smiled at him. He was folding his spectacles and putting them away in their case.“Is it the gentleman's birthday?”

“No,”said Johnson.“It's not a fête. My wife has decided to divorce me.”

“So,”said the porter.“I hope not.”The other porter shook his head. The third porter seemed a little deaf.

“It is doubtless a common experience,”said Johnson,“like the first visit to the dentist or the first time a girl is unwell, but I have been upset.”

“It is understandable,”said the oldest porter.“I understand it.”

“None of you gentlemen is divorced?”Johnson asked. He had stopped clowning with the language and was speaking good French now and had been for some time.

“No,”said the porter who had ordered Sportsman.“They don't divorce much here. There are gentlemen who are divorced but not many.”

“With us,”said Johnson,“it's different. Practically every one is divorced.”

“That's true,”the porter confirmed.“I've read it in the paper.”

“I myself am somewhat in retard,”Johnson went on.“This is the first time I have been divorced. I am thirty-five.”

“Mais vous êtes encore jeune,”said the porter. He explained to the two others.“Monsieur n'a que trente-cinq ans.”The other porters nodded.“He's very young,”said one.

“And it is really the first time you've been divorced?”asked the porter.

“Absolutely,”said Johnson.“Please open the wine, mademoiselle.”

“And is it very expensive?”

“Ten thousand francs.”

“Swiss money?”

“No, French money.”

“Oh, yes. Two thousand francs Swiss. All the same it's not cheap.”

“No.”

“And why does one do it?”

“One is asked to.”

“But why do they ask that?”

“To marry someone else.”

“But it's idiotic.”

“I agree with you,”said Johnson. The waitress filled the four glasses. They all raised them.

“Prosit,”said Johnson.

“A votre santé, monsieur,”said the porter. The other two porters said“Salut.”The champagne tasted like sweet pink cider.

“Is it a system always to respond in a different language in Switzerland?”Johnson asked.

“No,”said the porter.“French is more cultivated. Besides, this is La Suisse romande.”

“But you speak German?”

“Yes. Where I come from they speak German.”

“I see,”said Johnson,“and you say you have never been divorced?”

“No. It would be too expensive. Besides I have never married.”

“Ah,”said Johnson.“And these other gentlemen?”

“They are married.”

“You like being married?”Johnson asked one of the porters.

“What?”

“You like the married state?”

“Oui. C'est normale.”

“Exactly,”said Johnson.“Et vous, monsieur?”

“Ça va,”said the other porter.

“Pour moi,”said Johnson,“ça ne va pas.”

“Monsieur is going to divorce,”the first porter explained.

“Oh,”said the second porter.

“Ah ha,”the third porter said.

“Well,”said Johnson,“the subject seems to be exhausted. You're not interested in my troubles,”he addressed the first porter.

“But, yes,”said the porter.

“Well, let's talk about something else.”

“As you wish.”

“What can we talk about?”

“You do the sport?”

“No,”said Johnson.“My wife does, though.”

“What do you do for amusement?”

“I am a writer.”

“Does that make much money?”

“No. But later on when you get known it does.”

“It is interesting.”

“No,”said Johnson,“it is not interesting. I am sorry gentlemen, but I have to leave you. Will you please drink the other bottle?”

“But the train does not come for three-quarters of an hour.”

“I know,”said Johnson. The waitress came and he paid for the wine and his dinner.

“You're going out, sir?”she asked.

“Yes,”said Johnson,“just for a little walk. I'll leave my bags here.”

He put on his muffler, his coat, and his hat. Outside the snow was falling heavily. He looked back through the window at the three porters sitting at the table. The waitress was filling their glasses from the last wine of the opened bottle. She took the unopened bottle back to the bar. That makes them three francs something apiece, Johnson thought. He turned and walked down the platform. Inside the café he had thought that talking about it would blunt it; but it had not blunted it; it had only made him feel nasty.





PART III　THE SON OF A FELLOW MEMBER AT TERRITET


In the station café at Territet it was a little too warm; the lights were bright and the tables shiny from polishing. There were baskets with pretzels in glazed paper sacks on the tables and cardboard pads for beer glasses in order that the moist glasses would not make rings on the wood. The chairs were carved but the wooden seats were worn and quite comfortable. There was a clock on the wall, a bar at the far end of the room, and outside the window it was snowing. There was an old man drinking coffee at a table under the clock and reading the evening paper. A porter came in and said the Simplon-Orient Express was an hour late at Saint-Maurice. The waitress came over to Mr. Harris's table. Mr. Harris had just finished dinner.

“The Express is an hour late, sir. Can I bring you some coffee?”

“If you like.”

“Please?”asked the waitress.

“All right,”said Mr. Harris.

“Thank you, sir,”said the waitress.

She brought the coffee from the kitchen and Mr. Harris put sugar in it, crunched the lumps with his spoon, and looked out the window at the snow falling in the light from the station platform.

“Do you speak other languages besides English?”he asked the waitress.

“Oh, yes, sir. I speak German and French and the dialects.”

“Which do you like best?”

“They are all very much the same, sir. I can't say I like one better than another.”

“Would you like a drink of something or a coffee?”

“Oh, no, sir, it is not permitted to drink in the café with the clients.”

“You wouldn't take a cigar?”

“Oh, no, sir,”she laughed.“I don't smoke, sir.”

“Neither do I,”said Harris,“I don't agree with David Belasco.”

“Please?”

“Belasco. David Belasco. You can always tell him because he has his collar on backwards. But I don't agree with him. Then, too, he's dead now.”

“Will you excuse me, sir?”asked the waitress.

“Absolutely,”said Harris. He sat forward in the chair and looked out of the window. Across the room the old man had folded his paper. He looked at Mr. Harris and then picked up his coffee cup and saucer and walked to Harris's table.

“I beg your pardon if I intrude,”he said in English,“but it has just occurred to me that you might be a member of the National Geographic Society.”

“Please sit down,”Harris said. The gentleman sat down.

“Won't you have another coffee or a liqueur?”

“Thank you,”said the gentleman.

“Won't you have a kirsch with me?”

“Perhaps. But you must have it with me.”

“No, I insist.”Harris called the waitress. The old gentleman took out from an inside pocket of his coat a leather pocket-book. He took off a wide rubber band and drew out several papers, selected one, and handed it to Harris.

“That is my certificate of membership,”he said.“Do you know Frederick J. Roussel in America?”

“I'm afraid I don't.”

“I believe he is very prominent.”

“Where does he come from? Do you know what part of the States?”

“From Washington, of course. Isn't that the headquarters of the Society?”

“I believe it is.”

“You believe it is. Aren't you sure?”

“I've been away a long time,”Harris said.

“You're not a member, then?”

“No. But my father is. He's been a member for a great many years.”

“Then he would know Frederick J. Roussel. He is one of the officers of the society. You will observe that it is by Mr. Roussel that I was nominated for membership.”

“I'm awfully glad.”

“I am sorry you are not a member. But you could obtain nomination through your father?”

“I think so,”said Harris.“I must when I go back.”

“I would advise you to,”said the gentleman.“You see the magazine, of course?”

“Absolutely.”

“Have you seen the number with the colored plates of the North American fauna?”

“Yes. I have it in Paris.”

“And the number containing the panorama of the volcanoes of Alaska?”

“That was a wonder.”

“I enjoyed very much, too, the wild animal photographs of George Shiras three.”

“They were damned fine.”

“I beg your pardon?”

“They were excellent. That fellow Shiras—”

“You call him that fellow?”

“We're old friends,”said Harris.

“I see. You know George Shiras three. He must be very interesting.”

“He is. He's about the most interesting man I know.”

“And do you know George Shiras two? Is he interesting too?”

“Oh, he's not so interesting.”

“I should imagine he would be very interesting.”

“You know, a funny thing. He's not so interesting. I've often wondered why.”

“H'm,”said the gentleman.“I should have thought any one in that family would be interesting.”

“Do you remember the panorama of the Sahara Desert?”Harris asked.

“The Sahara Desert? That was nearly fifteen years ago.”

“That's right. That was one of my father's favorites.”

“He doesn't prefer the newer numbers?”

“He probably does. But he was very fond of the Sahara panorama.”

“It was excellent. But to me its artistic value far exceeded its scientific interest.”

“I don't know,”said Harris.“The wind blowing all that sand and that Arab with his camel kneeling toward Mecca.”

“As I recall, the Arab was standing holding the camel.”

“You're quite right,”said Harris.“I was thinking of Colonel Lawrence's book.”

“Lawrence's book deals with Arabia, I believe.”

“Absolutely,”said Harris.“It was the Arab reminded me of it.”

“He must be a very interesting young man.”

“I believe he is.”

“Do you know what he is doing now?”

“He's in the Royal Air Force.”

“And why does he do that?”

“He likes it.”

“Do you know if he belongs to the National Geographic Society?”

“I wonder if he does.”

“He would make a very good member. He is the sort of person they want as a member. I would be very happy to nominate him if you think they would like to have him.”

“I think they would.”

“I have nominated a scientist from Vevey and a colleague of mine from Lausanne and they were both elected. I believe they would be very pleased if I nominated Colonel Lawrence.”

“It's a splendid idea,”said Harris.“Do you come here to the café often?”

“I come here for coffee after dinner.”

“Are you in the University?”

“I am not active any longer.”

“I'm just waiting for the train,”said Harris.“I'm going up to Paris and sail from Havre for the States.”

“I have never been to America. But I would like to go very much. Perhaps I shall attend a meeting of the society some time. I would be very happy to meet your father.”

“I'm sure he would have liked to meet you but he died last year. Shot himself, oddly enough.”

“I am very truly sorry. I am sure his loss was a blow to science as well as to his family.”

“Science took it awfully well.”

“This is my card,”Harris said.“His initials were E. J. instead of E. D. I know he would have liked to know you.”

“It would have been a great pleasure.”The gentleman took out a card from the pocketbook and gave it to Harris. It read:



“I will keep it very carefully,”Harris said.





A Day's Wait


He came into the room to shut the windows while we were still in bed and I saw he looked ill. He was shivering, his face was white, and he walked slowly as though it ached to move.

“What's the matter, Schatz?”

“I've got a headache.”

“You better go back to bed.”

“No. I'm all right.”

“You go to bed. I'll see you when I'm dressed.”

But when I came downstairs he was dressed, sitting by the fire, looking a very sick and miserable boy of nine years. When I put my hand on his forehead I knew he had a fever.

“You go up to bed,”I said,“you're sick.”

“I'm all right,”he said.

When the doctor came he took the boy's temperature.

“What is it?”I asked him.

“One hundred and two.”

Downstairs, the doctor left three different medicines in different colored capsules with instructions for giving them. One was to bring down the fever, another a purgative, the third to overcome an acid condition. The germs of influenza can only exist in an acid condition, he explained. He seemed to know all about influenza and said there was nothing to worry about if the fever did not go above one hundred and four degrees. This was a light epidemic offlu and there was no danger if you avoided pneumonia.

Back in the room I wrote the boy's temperature down and made a note of the time to give the various capsules.

“Do you want me to read to you?”

“All right. If you want to,”said the boy. His face was very white and there were dark areas under his eyes. He lay still in the bed and seemed very detached from what was going on.

I read aloud from Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates; but I could see he was not following what I was reading.

“How do you feel, Schatz?”I asked him.

“Just the same, so far,”he said.

I sat at the foot of the bed and read to myself while I waited for it to be time to give another capsule. It would have been natural for him to go to sleep, but when I looked up he was looking at the foot of the bed, looking very strangely.

“Why don't you try to go to sleep? I'll wake you up for the medicine.”

“I'd rather stay awake.”

After a while he said to me,“You don't have to stay in here with me, Papa, if it bothers you.”

“It doesn't bother me.”

“No, I mean you don't have to stay if it's going to bother you.”

I thought perhaps he was a little lightheaded and after giving him the prescribed capsules at eleven o'clock I went out for a while.

It was a bright, cold day, the ground covered with a sleet that had frozen so that it seemed as if all the bare trees, the bushes, the cut brush and all the grass and the bare ground had been varnished with ice. I took the young Irish setter for a little walk up the road and along a frozen creek, but it was difficult to stand or walk on the glassy surface and the red dog slipped and slithered and I fell twice, hard, once dropping my gun and having it slide away over the ice.

We flushed a covey of quail under a high clay bank with overhanging brush and I killed two as they went out of sight over the top of the bank. Some of the covey lit in trees, but most of them scattered into brush piles and it was necessary to jump on the ice-coated mounds of brush several times before they would flush. Coming out while you were poised unsteadily on the icy, springy brush they made difficult shooting and I killed two, missed five, and started back pleased to have found a covey close to the house and happy there were so many left to find on another day.

At the house they said the boy had refused to let any one come into the room.

“You can't come in,”he said.“You mustn't get what I have.”

I went up to him and found him in exactly the position I had left him, white-faced, but with the tops of his cheeks flushed by the fever, staring still, as he had stared, at the foot of the bed.

I took his temperature.

“What is it?”

“Something like a hundred,”I said. It was one hundred and two and four tenths.

“It was a hundred and two,”he said.

“Who said so?”

“The doctor.”

“Your temperature is all right,”I said.“It's nothing to worry about.”

“I don't worry,”he said,“but I can't keep from thinking.”

“Don't think,”I said.“Just take it easy.”

“I'm taking it easy,”he said and looked straight ahead. He was evidently holding tight onto himself about something.

“Take this with water.”

“Do you think it will do any good?”

“Of course it will.”

I sat down and opened the Pirate book and commenced to read, but I could see he was not following, so I stopped.

“About what time do you think I'm going to die?”he asked.

“What?”

“About how long will it be before I die?”

“You aren't going to die. What's the matter with you?”

“Oh, yes, I am. I heard him say a hundred and two.”

“People don't die with a fever of one hundred and two. That's a silly way to talk.”

“I know they do. At school in France the boys told me you can't live with forty-four degrees. I've got a hundred and two.”

He had been waiting to die all day, ever since nine o'clock in the morning.

“You poor Schatz,”I said.“Poor old Schatz. It's like miles and kilometers. You aren't going to die. That's a different thermometer. On that thermometer thirty-seven is normal. On this kind it's ninety-eight.”

“Are you sure?”

“Absolutely,”I said.“It's like miles and kilometers. You know, like how many kilometers we make when we do seventy miles in the car?”

“Oh,”he said.

But his gaze at the foot of the bed relaxed slowly. The hold over himself relaxed too, finally, and the next day it was very slack and he cried very easily at little things that were of no importance.





A Natural History of the Dead


It has always seemed to me that the war has been omitted as a field for the observations of the naturalist. We have charming and sound accounts of the flora and fauna of Patagonia by the late W. H. Hudson, the Reverend Gilbert White has written most interestingly of the Hoopoe on its occasional and not at all common visits to Selborne, and Bishop Stanley has given us a valuable, although popular, Familiar History of Birds. Can we not hope to furnish the reader with a few rational and interesting facts about the dead? I hope so.

When that persevering traveller, Mungo Park, was at one period of his course fainting in the vast wilderness of an African desert, naked and alone, considering his days as numbered and nothing appearing to remain for him to do but to lie down and die, a small moss-flower of extraordinary beauty caught his eye.“Though the whole plant,”says he,“was no larger than one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves and capsules without admiration. Can that Being who planted, watered and brought to perfection, in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed after his own image? Surely not. Reflections like these would not allow me to despair; I started up and, disregarding both hunger and fatigue, travelled forward, assured that relief was at hand; and I was not disappointed.”

With a disposition to wonder and adore in like manner, as Bishop Stanley says, can any branch of Natural History be studied without increasing that faith, love and hope which we also, every one of us, need in our journey through the wilderness of life? Let us therefore see what inspiration we may derive from the dead.

In war the dead are usually the male of the human species although this does not hold true with animals, and I have frequently seen dead mares among the horses. An interesting aspect of war, too, is that it is only there that the naturalist has an opportunity to observe the dead of mules. In twenty years of observation in civil life I had never seen a dead mule and had begun to entertain doubts as to whether these animals were really mortal. On rare occasions I had seen what I took to be dead mules, but on close approach these always proved to be living creatures who seemed to be dead through their quality of complete repose. But in war these animals succumb in much the same manner as the more common and less hardy horse.

Most of those mules that I saw dead were along mountain roads or lying at the foot of steep declivities whence they had been pushed to rid the road of their encumbrance. They seemed a fitting enough sight in the mountains where one was accustomed to their presence and looked less incongruous there than they did later, at Smyrna, where the Greeks broke the legs of all their baggage animals and pushed them off the quay into the shallow water to drown. The numbers of broken-legged mules and horses drowning in the shallow water called for a Goya to depict them. Although, speaking literally, one can hardly say that they called for a Goya since there has only been one Goya, long dead, and it is extremely doubtful if these animals, were they able to call, would call for pictorial representation of their plight but, more likely, would, if they were articulate, call for some one to alleviate their condition.

Regarding the sex of the dead it is a fact that one becomes so accustomed to the sight of all the dead being men that the sight of a dead woman is quite shocking. I first saw inversion of the usual sex of the dead after the explosion of a munition factory which had been situated in the countryside near Milan, Italy. We drove to the scene of the disaster in trucks along poplar-shaded roads, bordered with ditches containing much minute animal life, which I could not clearly observe because of the great clouds of dust raised by the trucks. Arriving where the munition plant had been, some of us were put to patrolling about those large stocks of munitions which for some reason had not exploded, while others were put at extinguishing a fire which had gotten into the grass of an adjacent field; which task being concluded, we were ordered to search the immediate vicinity and surrounding fields for bodies. We found and carried to an improvised mortuary a good number of these and, I must admit, frankly, the shock it was to find that these dead were women rather than men. In those days women had not yet commenced to wear their hair cut short, as they did later for several years in Europe and America, and the most disturbing thing, perhaps because it was the most unaccustomed, was the presence and, even more disturbing, the occasional absence of this long hair. I remember that after we had searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments. Many of these were detached from a heavy, barbed-wire fence which had surrounded the position of the factory and from the still existent portions of which we picked many of these detached bits which illustrated only too well the tremendous energy of high explosive. Many fragments we found a considerable distance away in the fields, they being carried farther by their own weight.

On our return to Milan I recall one or two of us discussing the occurrence and agreeing that the quality of unreality and the fact that there were no wounded did much to rob the disaster of a horror which might have been much greater. Also the fact that it had been so immediate and that the dead were in consequence still as little unpleasant as possible to carry and deal with made it quite removed from the usual battlefield experience. The pleasant, though dusty, ride through the beautiful Lombard countryside also was a compensation for the unpleasantness of the duty and on our return, while we exchanged impressions, we all agreed that it was indeed fortunate that the fire which broke out just before we arrived had been brought under control as rapidly as it had and before it had attained any of the seemingly huge stocks of unexploded munitions. We agreed too that the picking up of the fragments had been an extraordinary business; it being amazing that the human body should be blown into pieces which exploded along no anatomical lines, but rather divided as capriciously as the fragmentation in the burst of a high explosive shell.

A naturalist, to obtain accuracy of observation, may confine himself in his observations to one limited period and I will take first that following the Austrian offensive of June, 1918, in Italy as one in which the dead were present in their greatest numbers, a withdrawal having been forced and an advance later made to recover the ground lost so that the positions after the battle were the same as before except for the presence of the dead. Until the dead are buried they change somewhat in appearance each day. The color change in Caucasian races is from white to yellow, to yellow-green, to black. If left long enough in the heat the flesh comes to resemble coal-tar, especially where it has been broken or torn, and it has quite a visible tarlike iridescence. The dead grow larger each day until sometimes they become quite too big for their uniforms, filling these until they seem blown tight enough to burst. The individual members may increase in girth to an unbelievable extent and faces fill as taut and globular as balloons. The surprising thing, next to their progressive corpulence, is the amount of paper that is scattered about the dead. Their ultimate position, before there is any question of burial, depends on the location of the pockets in the uniform. In the Austrian army these pockets were in the back of the breeches and the dead, after a short time, all consequently lay on their faces, the two hip pockets pulled out and, scattered around them in the grass, all those papers their pockets had contained. The heat, the flies, the indicative positions of the bodies in the grass, and the amount of paper scattered are the impressions one retains. The smell of a battlefield in hot weather one cannot recall. You can remember that there was such a smell, but nothing ever happens to you to bring it back. It is unlike the smell of a regiment, which may come to you suddenly while riding in the street car and you will look across and see the man who has brought it to you. But the other thing is gone as completely as when you have been in love; you remember things that happened, but the sensation cannot be recalled.

One wonders what that persevering traveller, Mungo Park, would have seen on a battlefield in hot weather to restore his confidence. There were always poppies in the wheat in the end of June and in July, and the mulberry trees were in full leaf and one could see the heat waves rise from the barrels of the guns where the sun struck them through the screens of leaves; the earth was turned a bright yellow at the edge of holes where mustard gas shells had been and the average broken house is finer to see than one that has been shelled, but few travellers would take a good full breath of that early summer air and have any such thoughts as Mungo Park about those formed in His own image.

The first thing that you found about the dead was that, hit badly enough, they died like animals. Some quickly from a little wound you would not think would kill a rabbit. They died from little wounds as rabbits die sometimes from three or four small grains of shot that hardly seem to break the skin. Others would die like cats; a skull broken in and iron in the brain, they lie alive two days like cats that crawl into the coal bin with a bullet in the brain and will not die until you cut their heads off. Maybe cats do not die then, they say they have nine lives, I do not know, but most men die like animals, not men. I'd never seen a natural death, so called, and so I blamed it on the war and like the persevering traveller, Mungo Park, knew that there was something else; that always absent something else, and then I saw one.

The only natural death I've ever seen, outside of loss of blood, which isn't bad, was death from Spanish influenza. In this you drown in mucus, choking, and how you know the patient's dead is: at the end he turns to be a little child again, though with his manly force, and fills the sheets as full as any diaper with one vast, final, yellow cataract that flows and dribbles on after he's gone. So now I want to see the death of any self-called Humanist(1) because a persevering traveller like Mungo Park or me lives on and maybe yet will live to see the actual death of members of this literary sect and watch the noble exits that they make. In my musings as a naturalist it has occurred to me that while decorum is an excellent thing some must be indecorous if the race is to be carried on since the position prescribed for procreation is indecorous, highly indecorous, and it occurred to me that perhaps that is what these people are, or were: the children of decorous cohabitation. But regardless of how they started I hope to see the finish of a few, and speculate how worms will try that long preserved sterility; with their quaint pamphlets gone to bust and into foot-notes all their lust.

While it is, perhaps, legitimate to deal with these self-designated citizens in a natural history of the dead, even though the designation may mean nothing by the time this work is published, yet it is unfair to the other dead, who were not dead in their youth of choice, who owned no magazines, many of whom had doubtless never even read a review, that one has seen in the hot weather with a half-pint of maggots working where their mouths have been. It was not always hot weather for the dead, much of the time it was the rain that washed them clean when they lay in it and made the earth soft when they were buried in it and sometimes then kept on until the earth was mud and washed them out and you had to bury them again. Or in the winter in the mountains you had to put them in the snow and when the snow melted in the spring some one else had to bury them. They had beautiful burying grounds in the mountains, war in the mountains is the most beautiful of all war, and in one of them, at a place called Pocol, they buried a general who was shot through the head by a sniper. This is where those writers are mistaken who write books called Generals Die in Bed, because this general died in a trench dug in snow, high in the mountains, wearing an Alpine hat with an eagle feather in it and a hole in front you couldn't put your little finger in and a hole in back you could put your fist in, if it were a small fist and you wanted to put it there, and much blood in the snow. He was a damned fine general, and so was General von Behr who commanded the Bavarian Alpenkorps troops at the battle of Caporetto and was killed in his staff car by the Italian rearguard as he drove into Udine ahead of his troops, and the titles of all such books should be Generals Usually Die in Bed, if we are to have any sort of accuracy in such things.

In the mountains too, sometimes, the snow fell on the dead outside the dressing station on the side that was protected by the mountain from any shelling. They carried them into a cave that had been dug into the mountainside before the earth froze. It was in this cave that a man whose head was broken as a flower-pot may be broken, although it was all held together by membranes and a skillfully applied bandage now soaked and hardened, with the structure of his brain disturbed by a piece of broken steel in it, lay a day, a night, and a day. The stretcher-bearers asked the doctor to go in and have a look at him. They saw him each time they made a trip and even when they did not look at him they heard him breathing. The doctor's eyes were red and the lids swollen, almost shut from tear gas. He looked at the man twice; once in daylight, once with a flashlight. That too would have made a good etching for Goya, the visit with the flashlight, I mean. After looking at him the second time the doctor believed the stretcher-bearers when they said the soldier was still alive.

“What do you want me to do about it?”he asked.

There was nothing they wanted done. But after a while they asked permission to carry him out and lay him with the badly wounded.

“No. No. No!”said the doctor, who was busy.“What's the matter? Are you afraid of him?”

“We don't like to hear him in there with the dead.”

“Don't listen to him. If you take him out of there you will have to carry him right back in.”

“We wouldn't mind that, Captain Doctor.”

“No,”said the doctor.“No. Didn't you hear me say no?”

“Why don't you give him an overdose of morphine?”asked an artillery officer who was waiting to have a wound in his arm dressed.

“Do you think that is the only use I have for morphine? Would you like me to have to operate without morphine? You have a pistol, go out and shoot him yourself.”

“He's been shot already,”said the officer.“If some of you doctors were shot you'd be different.”

“Thank you very much,”said the doctor waving a forceps in the air.“Thank you a thousand times. What about these eyes?”He pointed the forceps at them.“How would you like these?”

“Tear gas. We call it lucky if it's tear gas.”

“Because you leave the line,”said the doctor.“Because you come running here with your tear gas to be evacuated. You rub onions in your eyes.”

“You are beside yourself. I do not notice your insults. You are crazy.”

The stretcher-bearers came in.

“Captain Doctor,”one of them said.

“Get out of here!”said the doctor.

They went out.

“I will shoot the poor fellow,”the artillery officer said.“I am a humane man. I will not let him suffer.”

“Shoot him then,”said the doctor.“Shoot him. Assume the responsibility. I will make a report. Wounded shot by lieutenant of artillery in first curing post. Shoot him. Go ahead shoot him.”

“You are not a human being.”

“My business is to care for the wounded, not to kill them. That is for gentlemen of the artillery.”

“Why don't you care for him then?”

“I have done so. I have done all that can be done.”

“Why don't you send him down on the cable railway?”

“Who are you to ask me questions? Are you my superior officer? Are you in command of this dressing post? Do me the courtesy to answer.”

The lieutenant of artillery said nothing. The others in the room were all soldiers and there were no other officers present.

“Answer me,”said the doctor holding a needle up in his forceps.“Give me a response.”

“F—yourself,”said the artillery officer.

“So,”said the doctor.“So, you said that. All right. All right. We shall see.”

The lieutenant of artillery stood up and walked toward him.

“F—yourself,”he said.“F—yourself. F—your mother. F—your sister....”

The doctor tossed the saucer full of iodine in his face. As he came toward him, blinded, the lieutenant fumbled for his pistol. The doctor skipped quickly behind him, tripped him and, as he fell to the floor, kicked him several times and picked up the pistol in his rubber gloves. The lieutenant sat on the floor holding his good hand to his eyes.

“I'll kill you!”he said.“I'll kill you as soon as I can see.”

“I am the boss,”said the doctor.“All is forgiven since you know I am the boss. You cannot kill me because I have your pistol. Sergeant! Adjutant! Adjutant!”

“The adjutant is at the cable railway,”said the sergeant.

“Wipe out this officer's eyes with alcohol and water. He has got iodine in them. Bring me the basin to wash my hands. I will take this officer next.”

“You won't touch me.”

“Hold him tight. He is a little delirious.”

One of the stretcher-bearers came in.

“Captain Doctor.”

“What do you want?”

“The man in the dead-house—”

“Get out of here.”

“Is dead, Captain Doctor. I thought you would be glad to know.”

“See, my poor lieutenant? We dispute about nothing. In time of war we dispute about nothing.”

“F—you,”said the lieutenant of artillery. He still could not see.“You've blinded me.”

“It is nothing,”said the doctor.“Your eyes will be all right. It is nothing. A dispute about nothing.”

“Ayee! Ayee! Ayee!”suddenly screamed the lieutenant.“You have blinded me! You have blinded me!”

“Hold him tight,”said the doctor.“He is in much pain. Hold him very tight.”

The Gambler, the Nun, and the Radio


They brought them in around midnight and then, all night long, every one along the corridor heard the Russian.

“Where is he shot?”Mr. Frazer asked the night nurse.

“In the thigh, I think.”

“What about the other one?”

“Oh, he's going to die, I'm afraid.”

“Where is he shot?”

“Twice in the abdomen. They only found one of the bullets.”

They were both beet workers, a Mexican and a Russian, and they were sitting drinking coffee in an all-night restaurant when some one came in the door and started shooting at the Mexican. The Russian crawled under a table and was hit, finally, by a stray shot fired at the Mexican as he lay on the floor with two bullets in his abdomen. That was what the paper said.

The Mexican told the police he had no idea who shot him. He believed it to be an accident.

“An accident that he fired eight shots at you and hit you twice, there?”

“Sí, señor,”said the Mexican, who was named Cayetano Ruiz.

“An accident that he hit me at all, the cabrón,”he said to the interpreter.

“What does he say?”asked the detective sergeant, looking across the bed at the interpreter.

“He says it was an accident.”

“Tell him to tell the truth, that he is going to die,”the detective said.

“Na,”said Cayetano.“But tell him that I feel very sick and would prefer not to talk so much.”

“He says that he is telling the truth,”the interpreter said. Then, speaking confidently, to the detective,“He don't know who shot him. They shot him in the back.”

“Yes,”said the detective.“I understand that, but why did the bullets all go in the front?”

“Maybe he is spinning around,”said the interpreter.

“Listen,”said the detective, shaking his finger almost at Cayetano's nose, which projected, waxen yellow, from his dead-man's face in which his eyes were alive as a hawk's.“I don't give a damn who shot you, but I've got to clear this thing up. Don't you want the man who shot you to be punished? Tell him that,”he said to the interpreter.

“He says to tell who shot you.”

“Mandarlo al carajo,”said Cayetano, who was very tired.

“He says he never saw the fellow at all,”the interpreter said.“I tell you straight they shot him in the back.”

“Ask him who shot the Russian.”

“Poor Russian,”said Cayetano.“He was on the floor with his head enveloped in his arms. He started to give cries when they shoot him and he is giving cries ever since. Poor Russian.”

“He says some fellow that he doesn't know. Maybe the same fellow that shot him.”

“Listen,”the detective said.“This isn't Chicago. You're not a gangster. You don't have to act like a moving picture. It's all right to tell who shot you. Anybody would tell who shot them. That's all right to do. Suppose you don't tell who he is and he shoots somebody else. Suppose he shoots a woman or a child. You can't let him get away with that. You tell him,”he said to Mr. Frazer.“I don't trust that damn interpreter.”

“I am very reliable,”the interpreter said. Cayetano looked at Mr. Frazer.

“Listen, amigo,”said Mr. Frazer.“The policeman says that we are not in Chicago but in Hailey, Montana. You are not a bandit and this has nothing to do with the cinema.”

“I believe him,”said Cayetano softly.“Ya lo creo.”

“One can, with honor, denounce one's assailant. Every one does it here, he says. He says what happens if after shooting you, this man shoots a woman or a child?”

“I am not married,”Cayetano said.

“He says any woman, any child.”

“The man is not crazy,”Cayetano said.

“He says you should denounce him,”Mr. Frazer finished.

“Thank you,”Cayetano said.“You are of the great translators. I speak English, but badly. I understand it all right. How did you break your leg?”

“A fall off a horse.”

“What bad luck. I am very sorry. Does it hurt much?”

“Not now. At first, yes.”

“Listen, amigo,”Cayetano began,“I am very weak. You will pardon me. Also I have much pain; enough pain. It is very possible that I die. Please get this policeman out of here because I am very tired.”He made as though to roll to one side; then held himself still.

“I told him everything exactly as you said and he said to tell you, truly, that he doesn't know who shot him and that he is very weak and wishes you would question him later on,”Mr. Frazer said.

“He'll probably be dead later on.”

“That's quite possible.”

“That's why I want to question him now.”

“Somebody shot him in the back, I tell you,”the interpreter said.

“Oh, for Chrisake,”the detective sergeant said, and put his notebook in his pocket.




Outside in the corridor the detective sergeant stood with the interpreter beside Mr. Frazer's wheeled chair.

“I suppose you think somebody shot him in the back too?”

“Yes,”Frazer said.“Somebody shot him in the back. What's it to you?”

“Don't get sore,”the sergeant said.“I wish I could talk spick.”

“Why don't you learn?”

“You don't have to get sore. I don't get any fun out of asking that spick questions. If I could talk spick it would be different.”

“You don't need to talk Spanish,”the interpreter said.“I am a very reliable interpreter.”

“Oh, for Chrisake,”the sergeant said.“Well, so long. I'll come up and see you.”

“Thanks. I'm always in.”

“I guess you are all right. That was bad luck all right. Plenty bad luck.”

“It's coming along good now since he spliced the bone.”

“Yes, but it's a long time. A long, long time.”

“Don't let anybody shoot you in the back.”

“That's right,”he said.“That's right. Well, I'm glad you're not sore.”

“So long,”said Mr. Frazer.




Mr. Frazer did not see Cayetano again for a long time, but each morning Sister Cecilia brought news of him. He was so uncomplaining she said and he was very bad now. He had peritonitis and they thought he could not live. Poor Cayetano, she said. He had such beautiful hands and such a fine face and he never complains. The odor, now, was really terrific. He would point toward his nose with one finger and smile and shake his head, she said. He felt badly about the odor. It embarrassed him, Sister Cecilia said. Oh, he was such a fine patient. He always smiled. He wouldn't go to confession to Father but he promised to say his prayers, and not a Mexican had been to see him since he had been brought in. The Russian was going out at the end of the week. I could never feel anything about the Russian, Sister Cecilia said. Poor fellow, he suffered too. It was a greased bullet and dirty and the wound infected, but he made so much noise and then I always like the bad ones. That Cayetano, he's a bad one. Oh, he must really be a bad one, a thoroughly bad one, he's so fine and delicately made and he's never done any work with his hands. He's not a beet worker. I know he's not a beet worker. His hands are as smooth and not a callous on them. I know he's a bad one of some sort. I'm going down and pray for him now. Poor Cayetano, he's having a dreadful time and he doesn't make a sound. What did they have to shoot him for? Oh, that poor Cayetano! I'm going right down and pray for him.

She went right down and prayed for him.




In that hospital a radio did not work very well until it was dusk. They said it was because there was so much ore in the ground or something about the mountains, but anyway it did not work well at all until it began to get dark outside; but all night it worked beautifully and when one station stopped you could go farther west and pick up another. The last one that you could get was Seattle, Washington, and due to the difference in time, when they signed off at four o'clock in the morning it was five o'clock in the morning in the hospital; and at six o'clock you could get the morning revellers in Minneapolis. That was on account of the difference in time, too, and Mr. Frazer used to like to think of the morning revellers arriving at the studio and picture how they would look getting off a street-car before daylight in the morning carrying their instruments. Maybe that was wrong and they kept their instruments at the place they revelled, but he always pictured them with their instruments. He had never been in Minneapolis and believed he probably would never go there, but he knew what it looked like that early in the morning.

Out of the window of the hospital you could see a field with tumbleweed coming out of the snow, and a bare clay butte. One morning the doctor wanted to show Mr. Frazer two pheasants that were out there in the snow, and pulling the bed toward the window, the reading light fell off the iron bedstead and hit Mr. Frazer on the head. This does not sound so funny now but it was very funny then. Every one was looking out the window, and the doctor, who was a most excellent doctor, was pointing at the pheasants and pulling the bed toward the window, and then, just as in a comic section, Mr. Frazer was knocked out by the leaded base of the lamp hitting the top of his head. It seemed the antithesis of healing or whatever people were in the hospital for, and every one thought it was very funny, as a joke on Mr. Frazer and on the doctor. Everything is much simpler in a hospital, including the jokes.

From the other window, if the bed was turned, you could see the town, with a little smoke above it, and the Dawson mountains looking like real mountains with the winter snow on them. Those were the two views since the wheeled chair had proved to be premature. It is really best to be in bed if you are in a hospital; since two views, with time to observe them, from a room the temperature of which you control, are much better than any number of views seen for a few minutes from hot, empty rooms that are waiting for some one else, or just abandoned, which you are wheeled in and out of. If you stay long enough in a room the view, whatever it is, acquires a great value and becomes very important and you would not change it, not even by a different angle. Just as, with the radio, there are certain things that you become fond of, and you welcome them and resent the new things. The best tunes they had that winter were“Sing Something Simple,”“Singsong Girl,”and“Little White Lies.”No other tunes were as satisfactory, Mr. Frazer felt.“Betty Co-ed”was a good tune too, but the parody of the words which came unavoidably into Mr. Frazer's mind, grew so steadily and increasingly obscene that there being no one to appreciate it, he finally abandoned it and let the song go back to football.

About nine o'clock in the morning they would start using the X-ray machine, and then the radio, which, by then, was only getting Hailey, became useless. Many people in Hailey who owned radios protested about the hospital's X-ray machine which ruined their morning reception, but there was never any action taken, although many felt it was a shame the hospital could not use their machine at a time when people were not using their radios.

About the time when it became necessary to turn off the radio Sister Cecilia came in.

“How's Cayetano, Sister Cecilia?”Mr. Frazer asked.

“Oh, he's very bad.”

“Is he out of his head?”

“No, but I'm afraid he's going to die.”

“How are you?”

“I'm very worried about him, and do you know that absolutely no one has come to see him? He could die just like a dog for all those Mexicans care. They're really dreadful.”

“Do you want to come up and hear the game this afternoon?”

“Oh, no,”she said.“I'd be too excited. I'll be in the chapel praying.”

“We ought to be able to hear it pretty well,”Mr. Frazer said.“They're playing out on the coast and the difference in time will bring it late enough so we can get it all right.”

“Oh, no. I couldn't do it. The world series nearly finished me. When the Athletics were at bat I was praying right out loud:‘Oh, Lord, direct their batting eyes! Oh, Lord, may he hit one! Oh, Lord, may he hit safely!’Then when they filled the bases in the third game, you remember, it was too much for me.‘Oh, Lord, may he hit it out of the lot! Oh, Lord, may he drive it clean over the fence!’Then you know when the Cardinals would come to bat it was simply dreadful.‘Oh, Lord, may they not see it! Oh, Lord, don't let them even catch a glimpse of it! Oh, Lord, may they fan!’And this game is even worse. It's Notre Dame. Our Lady. No, I'll be in the chapel. For Our Lady. They're playing for Our Lady. I wish you'd write something sometime for Our Lady. You could do it. You know you could do it, Mr. Frazer.”

“I don't know anything about her that I could write. It's mostly been written already,”Mr. Frazer said.“You wouldn't like the way I write. She wouldn't care for it either.”

“You'll write about her sometime,”Sister said.“I know you will. You must write about Our Lady.”

“You'd better come up and hear the game.”

“It would be too much for me. No, I'll be in the chapel doing what I can.”

That afternoon they had been playing about five minutes when a probationer came into the room and said,“Sister Cecilia wants to know how the game is going?”

“Tell her they have a touchdown already.”

In a little while the probationer came into the room again.

“Tell her they're playing them off their feet,”Mr. Frazer said.

A little later he rang the bell for the nurse who was on floor duty.“Would you mind going down to the chapel or sending word down to Sister Cecilia that Notre Dame has them fourteen to nothing at the end of the first quarter and that it's all right. She can stop praying.”

In a few minutes Sister Cecilia came into the room. She was very excited.“What does fourteen to nothing mean? I don't know anything about this game. That's a nice safe lead in baseball. But I don't know anything about football. It may not mean a thing. I'm going right back down to the chapel and pray until it's finished.”

“They have them beaten,”Frazer said.“I promise you. Stay and listen with me.”

“No. No. No. No. No. No. No,”she said.“I'm going right down to the chapel to pray.”

Mr. Frazer sent down word whenever Notre Dame scored, and finally, when it had been dark a long time, the final result.

“How's Sister Cecilia?”

“They're all at chapel,”she said.

The next morning Sister Cecilia came in. She was very pleased and confident.

“I knew they couldn't beat Our Lady,”she said.“They couldn't. Cayetano's better too. He's much better. He's going to have visitors. He can't see them yet, but they are going to come and that will make him feel better and know he's not forgotten by his own people. I went down and saw that O'Brien boy at Police Headquarters and told him that he's got to send some Mexicans up to see poor Cayetano. He's going to send some this afternoon. Then that poor man will feel better. It's wicked the way no one has come to see him.”

That afternoon about five o'clock three Mexicans came into the room.

“Can one?”asked the biggest one, who had very thick lips and was quite fat.

“Why not?”Mr. Frazer answered.“Sit down, gentlemen. Will you take something?”

“Many thanks,”said the big one.

“Thanks,”said the darkest and smallest one.

“Thanks, no,”said the thin one.“It mounts to my head.”He tapped his head.

The nurse brought some glasses.“Please give them the bottle,”Frazer said.“It is from Red Lodge,”he explained.

“That of Red Lodge is the best,”said the big one.“Much better than that of Big Timber.”

“Clearly,”said the smallest one,“and costs more too.”

“In Red Lodge it is of all prices,”said the big one.

“How many tubes has the radio?”asked the one who did not drink.

“Seven.”

“Very beautiful,”he said.“What does it cost?”

“I don't know,”Mr. Frazer said.“It is rented.”

“You gentlemen are friends of Cayetano?”

“No,”said the big one.“We are friends of he who wounded him.”

“We were sent here by the police,”the smallest one said.

“We have a little place,”the big one said.“He and I,”indicating the one who did not drink.“He has a little place too,”indicating the small, dark one.“The police tell us we have to come—so we come.”

“I am very happy you have come.”

“Equally,”said the big one.

“Will you have another little cup?”

“Why not?”said the big one.

“With your permission,”said the smallest one.

“Not me,”said the thin one.“It mounts to my head.”

“It is very good,”said the smallest one.

“Why not try some,”Mr. Frazer asked the thin one.“Let a little mount to your head.”

“Afterwards comes the headache,”said the thin one.

“Could you not send friends of Cayetano to see him?”Frazer asked.

“He has no friends.”

“Every man has friends.”

“This one, no.”

“What does he do?”

“He is a card-player.”

“Is he good?”

“I believe it.”

“From me,”said the smallest one,“he won one hundred and eighty dollars. Now there is no longer one hundred and eighty dollars in the world.”

“From me,”said the thin one,“he won two hundred and eleven dollars. Fix yourself on that figure.”

“I never played with him,”said the fat one.

“He must be very rich,”Mr. Frazer suggested.

“He is poorer than we,”said the little Mexican.“He has no more than the shirt on his back.”

“And that shirt is of little value now,”Mr. Frazer said.“Perforated as it is.”

“Clearly.”

“The one who wounded him was a card-player?”

“No, a beet worker. He has had to leave town.”

“Fix yourself on this,”said the smallest one.“He was the best guitar player ever in this town. The finest.”

“What a shame.”

“I believe it,”said the biggest one.“How he could touch the guitar.”

“There are no good guitar players left?”

“Not the shadow of a guitar player.”

“There is an accordion player who is worth something,”the thin man said.

“There are a few who touch various instruments,”the big one said.“You like music?”

“How would I not?”

“We will come one night with music? You think the sister would allow it? She seems very amiable.”

“I am sure she would permit it when Cayetano is able to hear it.”“Is she a little crazy?”asked the thin one.

“Who?”

“That sister.”

“No,”Mr. Frazer said.“She is a fine woman of great intelligence and sympathy.”

“I distrust all priests, monks, and sisters,”said the thin one.

“He had bad experiences when a boy,”the smallest one said.

“I was acolyte,”the thin one said proudly.“Now I believe in nothing. Neither do I go to mass.”

“Why? Does it mount to your head?”

“No,”said the thin one.“It is alcohol that mounts to my head. Religion is the opium of the poor.”

“I thought marijuana was the opium of the poor,”Frazer said.

“Did you ever smoke opium?”the big one asked.

“No.”

“Nor I,”he said.“It seems it is very bad. One commences and cannot stop. It is a vice.”

“Like religion,”said the thin one.

“This one,”said the smallest Mexican,“is very strong against religion.”

“It is necessary to be very strong against something,”Mr. Frazer said politely.

“I respect those who have faith even though they are ignorant,”the thin one said.

“Good,”said Mr. Frazer.

“What can we bring you?”asked the big Mexican.“Do you lack for anything?”

“I would be glad to buy some beer if there is good beer.”

“We will bring beer.”

“Another copita before you go?”

“It is very good.”

“We are robbing you.”

“I can't take it. It goes to my head. Then I have a bad headache and sick at the stomach.”

“Good-by, gentlemen.”

“Good-by and thanks.”

They went out and there was supper and then the radio, turned to be as quiet as possible and still be heard, and the stations finally signing off in this order: Denver, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Mr. Frazer received no picture of Denver from the radio. He could see Denver from the Denver Post, and correct the picture from The Rocky Mountain News. Nor did he ever have any feel of Salt Lake City or Los Angeles from what he heard from those places. All he felt about Salt Lake City was that it was dean, but dull, and there were too many ballrooms mentioned in too many big hotels for him to see Los Angeles. He could not feel it for the ballrooms. But Seattle he came to know very well, the taxicab company with the big white cabs (each cab equipped with radio itself) he rode in every night out to the roadhouse on the Canadian side where he followed the course of parties by the musical selections they phoned for. He lived in Seattle from two o'clock on, each night, hearing the pieces that all the different people asked for, and it was as real as Minneapolis, where the revellers left their beds each morning to make that trip down to the studio. Mr. Frazer grew very fond of Seattle, Washington.




The Mexicans came and brought beer but it was not good beer. Mr. Frazer saw them but he did not feel like talking, and when they went he knew they would not come again. His nerves had become tricky and he disliked seeing people while he was in this condition. His nerves went bad at the end of five weeks, and while he was pleased they lasted that long yet he resented being forced to make the same experiment when he already knew the answer. Mr. Frazer had been through this all before. The only thing which was new to him was the radio. He played it all night long, turned so low he could barely hear it, and he was learning to listen to it without thinking.




Sister Cecilia came into the room about ten o'clock in the morning on that day and brought the mail. She was very handsome, and Mr. Frazer liked to see her and to hear her talk, but the mail, supposedly coming from a different world, was more important. However, there was nothing in the mail of any interest.

“You look so much better,”she said.“You'll be leaving us soon.”

“Yes,”Mr. Frazer said.“You look very happy this morning.”

“Oh, I am. This morning I feel as though I might be a saint.”

Mr. Frazer was a little taken aback at this.

“Yes,”Sister Cecilia went on.“That's what I want to be. A saint. Ever since I was a little girl I've wanted to be a saint. When I was a girl I thought if I renounced the world and went into the convent I would be a saint. That was what I wanted to be and that was what I thought I had to do to be one. I expected I would be a saint. I was absolutely sure I would be one. For just a moment I thought I was one. I was so happy and it seemed so simple and easy. When I awoke in the morning I expected I would be a saint, but I wasn't. I've never become one. I want so to be one. All I want is to be a saint. That is all I've ever wanted. And this morning I feel as though I might be one. Oh, I hope I will get to be one.”

“You'll be one. Everybody gets what they want. That's what they always tell me.”

“I don't know now. When I was a girl it seemed so simple. I knew I would be a saint. Only I believed it took time when I found it did not happen suddenly. Now it seems almost impossible.”

“I'd say you had a good chance.”

“Do you really think so? No, I don't want just to be encouraged. Don't just encourage me. I want to be a saint. I want so to be a saint.”

“Of course you'll be a saint,”Mr. Frazer said.

“No, probably I won't be. But, oh, if I could only be a saint! I'd be perfectly happy.”

“You're three to one to be a saint.”

“No, don't encourage me. But, oh, if I could only be a saint! If I could only be a saint!”

“How's your friend Cayetano?”

“He's going to get well but he's paralyzed. One of the bullets hit the big nerve that goes down through his thigh and that leg is paralyzed. They only found it out when he got well enough so that he could move.”

“Maybe the nerve will regenerate.”

“I'm praying that it will,”Sister Cecilia said.“You ought to see him.”

“I don't feel like seeing anybody.”

“You know you'd like to see him. They could wheel him in here.”

“All right.”




They wheeled him in, thin, his skin transparent, his hair black and needing to be cut, his eyes very laughing, his teeth bad when he smiled.

“Hola, amigo! Qué tal?”

“As you see,”said Mr. Frazer.“And thou?”

“Alive and with the leg paralyzed.”

“Bad,”Mr. Frazer said.“But the nerve can regenerate and be as good as new.”

“So they tell me.”

“What about the pain?”

“Not now. For a while I was crazy with it in the belly. I thought the pain alone would kill me.”

Sister Cecilia was observing them happily.

“She tells me you never made a sound,”Mr. Frazer said.

“So many people in the ward,”the Mexican said deprecatingly.“What class of pain do you have?”

“Big enough. Clearly not as bad as yours. When the nurse goes out I cry an hour, two hours. It rests me. My nerves are bad now.”

“You have the radio. If I had a private room and a radio I would be crying and yelling all night long.”

“I doubt it.”

“Hombre, sí. It's very healthy. But you cannot do it with so many people.”

“At least,”Mr. Frazer said,“the hands are still good. They tell me you make your living with the hands.”

“And the head,”he said, tapping his forehead.“But the head isn't worth as much.”

“Three of your countrymen were here.”

“Sent by the police to see me.”

“They brought some beer.”

“It probably was bad.”

“It was bad.”

“Tonight, sent by the police, they come to serenade me.”He laughed, then tapped his stomach.“I cannot laugh yet. As musicians they are fatal.”

“And the one who shot you?”

“Another fool. I won thirty-eight dollars from him at cards. That is not to kill about.”

“The three told me you win much money.”

“And am poorer than the birds.”

“How?”

“I am a poor idealist. I am the victim of illusions.”He laughed, then grinned and tapped his stomach.“I am a professional gambler but I like to gamble. To really gamble. Little gambling is all crooked. For real gambling you need luck. I have no luck.”

“Never?”

“Never. I am completely without luck. Look, this cabrón who shoots me just now. Can he shoot? No. The first shot he fires into nothing. The second is intercepted by a poor Russian. That would seem to be luck. What happens? He shoots me twice in the belly. He is a lucky man. I have no luck. He could not hit a horse if he were holding the stirrup. All luck.”

“I thought he shot you first and the Russian after.”

“No, the Russian first, me after. The paper was mistaken.”

“Why didn't you shoot him?”

“I never carry a gun. With my luck, if I carried a gun I would be hanged ten times a year. I am a cheap card player, only that.”He stopped, then continued.“When I make a sum of money I gamble and when I gamble I lose. I have passed at dice for three thousand dollars and crapped out for the six. With good dice. More than once.”

“Why continue?”

“If I live long enough the luck will change. I have bad luck now for fifteen years. If I ever get any good luck I will be rich.”He grinned.“I am a good gambler, really I would enjoy being rich.”

“Do you have bad luck with all games?”

“With everything and with women.”He smiled again, showing his bad teeth.

“Truly?”

“Truly.”

“And what is there to do?”

“Continue, slowly, and wait for luck to change.”

“But with women?”

“No gambler has luck with women. He is too concentrated. He works nights. When he should be with the woman. No man who works nights can hold a woman if the woman is worth anything.”

“You are a philosopher.”

“No, hombre. A gambler of the small towns. One small town, then another, another, then a big town, then start over again.”

“Then shot in the belly.”

“The first time,”he said.“That has only happened once.”

“I tire you talking?”Mr. Frazer suggested.

“No,”he said.“I must tire you.”

“And the leg?”

“I have no great use for the leg. I am all right with the leg or not. I will be able to circulate.”

“I wish you luck, truly, and with all my heart,”Mr. Frazer said.

“Equally,”he said.“And that the pain stops.”

“It will not last, certainly. It is passing. It is of no importance.”

“That it passes quickly.”

“Equally.”




That night the Mexicans played the accordion and other instruments in the ward and it was cheerful and the noise of the inhalations and exhalations of the accordion, and of the bells, the traps, and the drum came down the corridor. In that ward there was a rodeo rider who had come out of the chutes on Midnight on a hot dusty afternoon with the big crowd watching, and now, with a broken back, was going to learn to work in leather and to cane chairs when he got well enough to leave the hospital. There was a carpenter who had fallen with a scaffolding and broken both ankles and both wrists. He had lit like a cat but without a cat's resiliency. They could fix him up so that he could work again but it would take a long time. There was a boy from a farm, about sixteen years old, with a broken leg that had been badly set and was to be rebroken. There was Cayetano Ruiz, a small-town gambler with a paralyzed leg. Down the corridor Mr. Frazer could hear them all laughing and merry with the music made by the Mexicans who had been sent by the police. The Mexicans were having a good time. They came in, very excited, to see Mr. Frazer and wanted to know if there was anything he wanted them to play, and they came twice more to play at night of their own accord.

The last time they played Mr. Frazer lay in his room with the door open and listened to the noisy, bad music and could not keep from thinking. When they wanted to know what he wished played, he asked for the Cucaracha, which has the sinister lightness and deftness of so many of the tunes men have gone to die to. They played noisily and with emotion. The tune was better than most of such tunes, to Mr. Frazer's mind, but the effect was all the same.

In spite of this introduction of emotion, Mr. Frazer went on thinking. Usually he avoided thinking all he could, except when he was writing, but now he was thinking about those who were playing and what the little one had said.

Religion is the opium of the people. He believed that, that dyspeptic little joint-keeper. Yes, and music is the opium of the people. Old mount-to-the-head hadn't thought of that. And now economics is the opium of the people; along with patriotism the opium of the people in Italy and Germany. What about sexual intercourse; was that an opium of the people? Of some of the people. Of some of the best of the people. But drink was a sovereign opium of the people, oh, an excellent opium. Although some prefer the radio, another opium of the people, a cheap one he had just been using. Along with these went gambling, an opium of the people if there ever was one, one of the oldest. Ambition was another, an opium of the people, along with a belief in any new form of government. What you wanted was the minimum of government, always less government. Liberty, what we believed in, now the name of a MacFadden publication. We believed in that although they had not found a new name for it yet. But what was the real one? What was the real, the actual, opium of the people? He knew it very well. It was gone just a little way around the corner in that well-lighted part of his mind that was there after two or more drinks in the evening; that he knew was there (it was not really there of course). What was it? He knew very well. What was it? Of course; bread was the opium of the people. Would he remember that and would it make sense in the daylight? Bread is the opium of the people.

“Listen,”Mr. Frazer said to the nurse when she came.“Get that little thin Mexican in here, will you, please?”

“How do you like it?”the Mexican said at the door.

“Very much.”

“It is a historic tune,”the Mexican said.“It is the tune of the real revolution.”

“Listen,”said Mr. Frazer.“Why should the people be operated on without an anaesthetic?”

“I do not understand.”

“Why are not all the opiums of the people good? What do you want to do with the people?”

“They should be rescued from ignorance.”

“Don't talk nonsense. Education is an opium of the people. You ought to know that. You've had a little.”

“You do not believe in education?”

“No,”said Mr. Frazer.“In knowledge, yes.”

“I do not follow you.”

“Many times I do not follow myself with pleasure.”

“You want to hear the Cucaracha another time?”asked the Mexican worriedly.

“Yes,”said Mr. Frazer.“Play the Cucaracha another time. It's better than the radio.”

Revolution, Mr. Frazer thought, is no opium. Revolution is a catharsis; an ecstasy which can only be prolonged by tyranny. The opiums are for before and for after. He was thinking well, a little too well.

They would go now in a little while, he thought, and they would take the Cucaracha with them. Then he would have a little spot of the giant killer and play the radio, you could play the radio so that you could hardly hear it.





Fathers and Sons


There had been a sign to detour in the center of the main street of this town, but cars had obviously gone through, so, believing it was some repair which had been completed, Nicholas Adams drove on through the town along the empty, brick-paved street, stopped by traffic lights that flashed on and off on this traffic-less Sunday, and would be gone next year when the payments on the system were not met; on under the heavy trees of the small town that are a part of your heart if it is your town and you have walked under them, but that are only too heavy, that shut out the sun and that dampen the houses for a stranger; out past the last house and onto the highway that rose and fell straight away ahead with banks of red dirt sliced cleanly away and the second-growth timber on both sides. It was not his country but it was the middle of fall and all of this country was good to drive through and to see. The cotton was picked and in the clearings there were patches of corn, some cut with streaks of red sorghum, and, driving easily, his son asleep on the seat by his side, the day's run made, knowing the town he would reach for the night, Nick noticed which corn fields had soy beans or peas in them, how the thickets and the cut-over land lay, where the cabins and houses were in relation to the fields and the thickets; hunting the country in his mind as he went by; sizing up each clearing as to feed and cover and figuring where you would find a covey and which way they would fly.

In shooting quail you must not get between them and their habitual cover, once the dogs have found them, or when they flush they will come pouring at you, some rising steep, some skimming by your ears, whirring into a size you have never seen them in the air as they pass, the only way being to turn and take them over your shoulder as they go, before they set their wings and angle down into the thicket. Hunting this country for quail as his father had taught him, Nicholas Adams started thinking about his father. When he first thought about him it was always the eyes. The big frame, the quick movements, the wide shoulders, the hooked, hawk nose, the beard that covered the weak chin, you never thought about—it was always the eyes. They were protected in his head by the formation of the brows; set deep as though a special protection had been devised for some very valuable instrument. They saw much farther and much quicker than the human eye sees and they were the great gift his father had. His father saw as a big-horn ram or as an eagle sees, literally.

He would be standing with his father on one shore of the lake, his own eyes were very good then, and his father would say,“They've run up the flag.”Nick could not see the flag or the flag pole.“There,”his father would say,“it's your sister Dorothy. She's got the flag up and she's walking out onto the dock.”

Nick would look across the lake and he could see the long wooded shore-line, the higher timber behind, the point that guarded the bay, the clear hills of the farm and the white of their cottage in the trees but he could not see anyflag pole, or any dock, only the white of the beach and the curve of the shore.

“Can you see the sheep on the hillside toward the point?”

“Yes.”

They were a whitish patch on the gray-green of the hill.

“I can count them,”his father said.

Like all men with a faculty that surpasses human requirements, his father was very nervous. Then, too, he was sentimental, and, like most sentimental people, he was both cruel and abused. Also, he had much bad luck, and it was not all of it his own. He had died in a trap that he had helped only a little to set, and they had all betrayed him in their various ways before he died. All sentimental people are betrayed so many times. Nick could not write about him yet, although he would, later, but the quail country made him remember him as he was when Nick was a boy and he was very grateful to him for two things: fishing and shooting. His father was as sound on those two things as he was unsound on sex, for instance, and Nick was glad that it had been that way; for some one has to give you your first gun or the opportunity to get it and use it, and you have to live where there is game or fish if you are to learn about them, and now, at thirty-eight, he loved to fish and to shoot exactly as much as when he first had gone with his father. It was a passion that had never slackened and he was very grateful to his father for bringing him to know it.

While for the other, that his father was not sound about, all the equipment you will ever have is provided and each man learns all there is for him to know about it without advice; and it makes no difference where you live. He remembered very clearly the only two pieces of information his father had given him about that. Once when they were out shooting together Nick shot a red squirrel out of a hemlock tree. The squirrel fell, wounded, and when Nick picked him up bit the boy clean through the ball of the thumb.

“The dirty little bugger,”Nick said and smacked the squirrel's head against the tree.“Look how he bit me.”

His father looked and said,“Suck it out clean and put some iodine on when you get home.”

“The little bugger,”Nick said.

“Do you know what a bugger is?”his father asked him.

“We call anything a bugger,”Nick said.

“A bugger is a man who has intercourse with animals.”

“Why?”Nick said.

“I don't know,”his father said.“But it is a heinous crime.”

Nick's imagination was both stirred and horrified by this and he thought of various animals but none seemed attractive or practical and that was the sum total of direct sexual knowledge bequeathed him by his father except on one other subject. One morning he read in the paper that Enrico Caruso had been arrested for mashing.

“What is mashing?”

“It is one of the most heinous of crimes,”his father answered. Nick's imagination pictured the great tenor doing something strange, bizarre, and heinous with a potato masher to a beautiful lady who looked like the pictures of Anna Held on the inside of cigar boxes. He resolved, with considerable horror, that when he was old enough he would try mashing at least once.

His father had summed up the whole matter by stating that masturbation produced blindness, insanity, and death, while a man who went with prostitutes would contract hideous venereal diseases and that the thing to do was to keep your hands off of people. On the other hand his father had the finest pair of eyes he had ever seen and Nick had loved him very much and for a long time. Now, knowing how it had all been, even remembering the earliest times before things had gone badly was not good remembering. If he wrote it he could get rid of it. He had gotten rid of many things by writing them. But it was still too early for that. There were still too many people. So he decided to think of something else. There was nothing to do about his father and he had thought it all through many times. The handsome job the undertaker had done on his father's face had not blurred in his mind and all the rest of it was quite clear, including the responsibilities. He had complimented the undertaker. The undertaker had been both proud and smugly pleased. But it was not the undertaker that had given him that last face. The undertaker had only made certain dashingly executed repairs of doubtful artistic merit. The face had been making itself and being made for a long time. It had modelled fast in the last three years. It was a good story but there were still too many people alive for him to write it.

Nick's own education in those earlier matters had been acquired in the hemlock woods behind the Indian camp. This was reached by a trail which ran from the cottage through the woods to the farm and then by a road which wound through the slashings to the camp. Now if he could still feel all of that trail with bare feet. First there was the pine-needle loam through the hemlock woods behind the cottage where the fallen logs crumbled into wood dust and long splintered pieces of wood hung like javelins in the tree that had been struck by lightning. You crossed the creek on a log and if you stepped off there was the black muck of the swamp. You climbed a fence out of the woods and the trail was hard in the sun across the field with cropped grass and sheep sorrel and mullen growing and to the left the quaky bog of the creek bottom where the killdeer plover fed. The spring house was in that creek. Below the barn there was fresh warm manure and the other older manure that was caked dry on top. Then there was another fence and the hard, hot trail from the barn to the house and the hot sandy road that ran down to the woods, crossing the creek, on a bridge this time, where the cat-tails grew that you soaked in kerosene to make jack-lights with for spearing fish at night.

Then the main road went off to the left, skirting the woods and climbing the hill, while you went into the woods on the wide clay and shale road, cool under the trees, and broadened for them to skid out the hemlock bark the Indians cut. The hemlock bark was piled in long rows of stacks, roofed over with more bark, like houses, and the peeled logs lay huge and yellow where the trees had been felled. They left the logs in the woods to rot, they did not even clear away or burn the tops. It was only the bark they wanted for the tannery at Boyne City; hauling it across the lake on the ice in winter, and each year there was less forest and more open, hot, shadeless, weed-grown slashing.

But there was still much forest then, virgin forest where the trees grew high before there were any branches and you walked on the brown, clean, springy-needled ground with no undergrowth and it was cool on the hottest days and they three lay against the trunk of a hemlock wider than two beds are long, with the breeze high in the tops and the cool light that came in patches, and Billy said:

“You want Trudy again?”

“You want to?”

“Un Huh.”

“Come on.”

“No, here.”

“But Billy—”

“I no mind Billy. He my brother.”




Then afterwards they sat, the three of them, listening for a black squirrel that was in the top branches where they could not see him. They were waiting for him to bark again because when he barked he would jerk his tail and Nick would shoot where he saw any movement. His father gave him only three cartridges a day to hunt with and he had a single-barrel twenty-gauge shotgun with a very long barrel.

“Son of a bitch never move,”Billy said.

“You shoot, Nickie. Scare him. We see him jump. Shoot him again,”Trudy said. It was a long speech for her.

“I've only got two shells,”Nick said.

“Son of a bitch,”said Billy.

They sat against the tree and were quiet. Nick was feeling hollow and happy.

“Eddie says he going to come some night sleep in bed with you sister Dorothy.”

“What?”

“He said.”

Trudy nodded.

“That's all he want do,”she said. Eddie was their older half-brother. He was seventeen.

“If Eddie Gilby ever comes at night and even speaks to Dorothy you know what I'd do to him? I'd kill him like this.”Nick cocked the gun and hardly taking aim pulled the trigger, blowing a hole as big as your hand in the head or belly of that half-breed bastard Eddie Gilby.“Like that. I'd kill him like that.”

“He better not come then,”Trudy said. She put her hand in Nick's pocket.

“He better watch out plenty,”said Billy.

“He's big bluff,”Trudy was exploring with her hand in Nick's pocket.“But don't you kill him. You get plenty trouble.”

“I'd kill him like that,”Nick said. Eddie Gilby lay on the ground with all his chest shot away. Nick put his foot on him proudly.

“I'd scalp him,”he said happily.

“No,”said Trudy.“That's dirty.”

“I'd scalp him and send it to his mother.”

“His mother dead,”Trudy said.“Don't you kill him, Nickie. Don't you kill him for me.”

“After I scalped him I'd throw him to the dogs.”

Billy was very depressed.“He better watch out,”he said gloomily.

“They'd tear him to pieces,”Nick said, pleased with the picture. Then, having scalped that half-breed renegade and standing, watching the dogs tear him, his face unchanging, he fell backward against the tree, held tight around the neck, Trudy holding, choking him, and crying,“No kill him! No kill him! No kill him! No. No. No. Nickie. Nickie. Nickie!”

“What's the matter with you?”

“No kill him.”

“I got to kill him.”

“He just a big bluff.”

“All right,”Nickie said.“I won't kill him unless he comes around the house. Let go of me.”

“That's good,”Trudy said.“You want to do anything now? I feel good now.”

“If Billy goes away.”Nick had killed Eddie Gilby, then pardoned him his life, and he was a man now.

“You go, Billy. You hang around all the time. Go on.”

“Son a bitch,”Billy said.“I get tired this. What we come? Hunt or what?”

“You can take the gun. There's one shell.”

“All right. I get a big black one all right.”

“I'll holler,”Nick said.

Then, later, it was a long time after and Billy was still away.

“You think we make a baby?”Trudy folded her brown legs together happily and rubbed against him. Something inside Nick had gone a long way away.

“I don't think so,”he said.

“Make plenty baby what the hell.”

They heard Billy shoot.

“I wonder if he got one.”

“Don't care,”said Trudy.

Billy came through the trees. He had the gun over his shoulder and he held a black squirrel by the front paws.

“Look,”he said.“Bigger than a cat. You all through?”

“Where'd you get him?”

“Over there. Saw him jump first.”

“Got to go home,”Nick said.

“No,”said Trudy.

“I got to get there for supper.”

“All right.”

“Want to hunt tomorrow?”

“All right.”

“You can have the squirrel.”

“All right.”

“Come out after supper?”

“No.”

“How you feel?”

“Good.”

“All right.”

“Give me kiss on the face,”said Trudy.

Now, as he rode along the highway in the car and it was getting dark, Nick was all through thinking about his father. The end of the day never made him think of him. The end of the day had always belonged to Nick alone and he never felt right unless he was alone at it. His father came back to him in the fall of the year, or in the early spring when there had been jacksnipe on the prairie, or when he saw shocks of corn, or when he saw a lake, or if he ever saw a horse and buggy, or when he saw, or heard, wild geese, or in a duck blind; remembering the time an eagle dropped through the whirling snow to strike a canvas-covered decoy, rising, his wings beating, the talons caught in the canvas. His father was with him, suddenly, in deserted orchards and in new-plowed fields, in thickets, on small hills, or when going through dead grass, whenever splitting wood or hauling water, by grist mills, cider mills and dams and always with open fires. The towns he lived in were not towns his father knew. After he was fifteen he had shared nothing with him.

His father had frost in his beard in cold weather and in hot weather he sweated very much. He liked to work in the sun on the farm because he did not have to and he loved manual work, which Nick did not. Nick loved his father but hated the smell of him and once when he had to wear a suit of his father's underwear that had gotten too small for his father it made him feel sick and he took it off and put it under two stones in the creek and said that he had lost it. He had told his father how it was when his father had made him put it on but his father had said it was freshly washed. It had been, too. When Nick had asked him to smell of it his father sniffed at it indignantly and said that it was clean and fresh. When Nick came home from fishing without it and said he lost it he was whipped for lying.

Afterwards he had sat inside the woodshed with the door open, his shotgun loaded and cocked, looking across at his father sitting on the screen porch reading the paper, and thought,“I can blow him to hell. I can kill him.”Finally he felt his anger go out of him and he felt a little sick about it being the gun that his father had given him. Then he had gone to the Indian camp, walking there in the dark, to get rid of the smell. There was only one person in his family that he liked the smell of; one sister. All the others he avoided all contact with. That sense blunted when he started to smoke. It was a good thing. It was good for a bird dog but it did not help a man.

“What was it like, Papa, when you were a little boy and used to hunt with the Indians?”

“I don't know,”Nick was startled. He had not even noticed the boy was awake. He looked at him sitting beside him on the seat. He had felt quite alone but this boy had been with him. He wondered for how long.“We used to go all day to hunt black squirrels,”he said.“My father only gave me three shells a day because he said that would teach me to hunt and it wasn't good for a boy to go banging around. I went with a boy named Billy Gilby and his sister Trudy. We used to go out nearly every day all one summer.”

“Those are funny names for Indians.”

“Yes, aren't they,”Nick said.

“But tell me what they were like.”

“They were Ojibways,”Nick said.“And they were very nice.”

“But what were they like to be with?”

“It's hard to say,”Nick Adams said. Could you say she did first what no one has ever done better and mention plump brown legs, flat belly, hard little breasts, well holding arms, quick searching tongue, the flat eyes, the good taste of mouth, then uncomfortably, tightly, sweetly, moistly, lovely, tightly, achingly, fully, finally, unendingly, never-endingly, never-to-endingly, suddenly ended, the great bird flown like an owl in the twilight, only it was daylight in the woods and hemlock needles stuck against your belly. So that when you go in a place where Indians have lived you smell them gone and all the empty pain killer bottles and the flies that buzz do not kill the sweetgrass smell, the smoke smell and that other like a fresh cased marten skin. Nor any jokes about them nor old squaws take that away. Nor the sick sweet smell they get to have. Nor what they did finally. It wasn't how they ended. They all ended the same. Long time ago good. Now no good.

And about the other. When you have shot one bird flying you have shot all birds flying. They are all different and they fly in different ways but the sensation is the same and the last one is as good as the first. He could thank his father for that.

“You might not like them,”Nick said to the boy.“But I think you would.”

“And my grandfather lived with them too when he was a boy, didn't he?”

“Yes. When I asked him what they were like he said that he had many friends among them.”

“Will I ever live with them?”

“I don't know,”Nick said.“That's up to you.”

“How old will I be when I get a shotgun and can hunt by myself?”

“Twelve years old if I see you are careful.”

“I wish I was twelve now.”

“You will be, soon enough.”

“What was my grandfather like? I can't remember him except that he gave me an air rifle and an American flag when I came over from France that time. What was he like?”

“He's hard to describe. He was a great hunter and fisherman and he had wonderful eyes.”

“Was he greater than you?”

“He was a much better shot and his father was a great wing shot too.”

“I'll bet he wasn't better than you.”

“Oh, yes he was. He shot very quickly and beautifully. I'd rather see him shoot than any man I ever knew. He was always very disappointed in the way I shot.”

“Why do we never go to pray at the tomb of my grandfather?”

“We live in a different pan of the country. It's a long way from here.”

“In France that wouldn't make any difference. In France we'd go. I think I ought to go to pray at the tomb of my grandfather.”

“Sometime we'll go.”

“I hope we won't live somewhere so that I can never go to pray at your tomb when you are dead.”

“We'll have to arrange it.”

“Don't you think we might all be buried at a convenient place? We could all be buried in France. That would be fine.”

“I don't want to be buried in France,”Nick said.

“Well, then, we'll have to get some convenient place in America. Couldn't we all be buried out at the ranch?”

“That's an idea.”

“Then I could stop and pray at the tomb of my grandfather on the way to the ranch.”

“You're awfully practical.”

“Well, I don't feel good never to have even visited the tomb of my grandfather.”

“We'll have to go,”Nick said.“I can see we'll have to go.”





One Trip Across


You know how it is there early in the morning in Havana with the bums still asleep against the walls of the buildings; before even the ice wagons come by with ice for the bars? Well, we came across the square from the dock to the Pearl of San Francisco Café to get coffee and there was only one beggar awake in the square and he was getting a drink out of the fountain. But when we got inside the café and sat down, there were the three of them waiting for us.

We sat down and one of them came over.

“Well,”he said.

“I can't do it,”I told him.“I'd like to do it as a favor. But I told you last night I couldn't.”

“You can name your own price.”

“It isn't that. I can't do it. That's all.”

The two others had come over and they stood there looking sad. They were nice-looking fellows all right and I would have liked to have done them the favor.

“A thousand apiece,”said the one who spoke good English.

“Don't make me feel bad,”I told him.“I tell you true I can't do it.”

“Afterwards, when things are changed, it would mean a good deal to you.”

“I know it. I'm all for you. But I can't do it.”

“Why not?”

“I make my living with the boat. If I lose her I lose my living.”

“With the money you buy another boat.”

“Not in jail.”

They must have thought I just needed to be argued into it because the one kept on.

“You would have three thousand dollars and it could mean a great deal to you later. All this will not last, you know.”

“Listen,”I said.“I don't care who is President here. But I don't carry anything to the States that can talk.”

“You mean we would talk?”one of them who hadn't spoken said. He was angry.

“I said anything that can talk.”

“Do you think we are lenguas largas?”

“No.”

“Do you know what a lengua larga is?”

“Yes. One with a long tongue.”

“Do you know what we do with them?”

“Don't be tough with me,”I said.“You propositioned me. I didn't offer you anything.”

“Shut up, Pancho,”the one who had done the talking before said to the angry one.

“He said we would talk,”Pancho said.

“Listen,”I said.“I told you I didn't carry anything that can talk. Sacked liquor can't talk. Demijohns can't talk. There's other things that can't talk. Men can talk.”

“Can Chinamen talk?”Pancho said, pretty nasty.

“They can talk, but I can't understand them,”I told him.

“So you won't?”

“It's just like I told you last night. I can't.”

“But you won't talk?”Pancho said.

The one thing that he hadn't understood right had made him nasty. I guess it was disappointment, too. I didn't even answer him.

“You're not a lengua larga, are you?”he asked, still nasty.

“I don't think so.”

“What's that? A threat?”

“Listen,”I told him.“Don't be so tough so early in the morning. I'm sure you've cut plenty people's throats. I haven't even had my coffee yet.”

“So you're sure I've cut people's throats?”

“No,”I said.“And I don't give a damn. Can't you do business without getting angry?”

“I am angry now,”he said.“I would like to kill you.”

“Oh, hell,”I told him,“don't talk so much.”

“Come on, Pancho, the first one said. Then, to me,“I am very sorry. I wish you would take us.”

“I'm sorry, too. But I can't.”

The three of them started for the door, and I watched them go. They were good-looking young fellows, wore good clothes; none of them wore hats, and they looked like they had plenty of money. They talked plenty of money, anyway, and they spoke the kind of English Cubans with money speak.

Two of them looked like brothers and the other one, Pancho, was a little taller but the same sort of looking kid. You know, slim, good clothes, and shiny hair. I didn't figure he was as mean as he talked. I figured he was plenty nervous.

As they turned out of the door to the right, I saw a closed car come across the square toward them. The first thing a pane of glass went and the bullet smashed into the row of bottles on the show-case wall to the right. I heard the gun going and, bop, bop, bop, there were bottles smashing all along the wall.

I jumped behind the bar on the left side and could see looking over the edge. The car was stopped and there were two fellows crouched down by it. One had a Thompson gun and the other had a sawed-off automatic shotgun. The one with the Thompson gun was a nigger. The other had a chauffeur's white duster on.

One of the boys was spread out on the sidewalk, face down, just outside the big window that was smashed. The other two were behind one of the Tropical beer ice wagons that was stopped in front of the Cunard bar next door. One of the ice-wagon horses was down in the harness, kicking, and the other was plunging his head off.

One of the boys shot from the rear corner of the wagon and it ricocheted off the sidewalk. The nigger with the tommy gun got his face almost into the street and gave the back of the wagon a burst from underneath and sure enough one came down, falling toward the sidewalk with his head above the curb. He flopped there, putting his hands over his head, and the chauffeur shot at him with the shotgun while the nigger put in a fresh pan, but it was a long shot. You could see the buckshot marks all over the sidewalk like silver splatters.

The other fellow pulled the one who was hit back by the legs to behind the wagon, and I saw the nigger getting his face down on the paving to give them another burst. Then I saw old Pancho come around the corner of the wagon and step into the lee of the horse that was still up. He stepped clear of the horse, his face white as a dirty sheet, and got the chauffeur with the big Luger he had, holding it in both hands to keep it steady. He shot twice over the nigger's head, coming on, and once low.

He hit a tire on the car because I saw dust blowing in a spurt on the street as the air came out, and at ten feet the nigger shot him in the belly with his tommy gun, with what must have been the last shot in it because I saw him throw it down, and old Pancho sat down hard and went over forward. He was trying to come up, still holding onto the Luger, only he couldn't get his head up, when the nigger took the shotgun that was lying against the wheel of the car by the chauffeur and blew the side of his head off. Some nigger.

I took a quick one out of the first bottle I saw open and I couldn't tell you yet what it was. The whole thing made me feel pretty bad. I slipped along behind the bar and out through the kitchen in back and all the way out. I went clean around the outside of the square and never even looked over toward the crowd there was coming fast in front of the café and went in through the gate and out onto the dock and got on board.

The fellow who had her chartered was on board waiting. I told him what had happened.

“Where's Eddy?”this fellow Johnson that had her chartered asked me.

“I never saw him after the shooting started.”

“Do you suppose he was hit?”

“Hell no. I tell you the only shots that came in the café were into the show case. That was when the car was coming behind them. That was when they shot the first fellow right in front of the window. They came at an angle like this—”

“You seem awfully sure about it,”he said.

“I was watching,”I told him.

Then, as I looked up, I saw Eddy coming along the dock looking taller and sloppier than ever. He walked with his joints all slung wrong.

“There he is.”

Eddy looked pretty bad. He never looked too good early in the morning but he looked plenty bad now.

“Where were you?”I asked him.

“On the floor.”

“Did you see it?”Johnson asked him.

“Don't talk about it, Mr. Johnson,”Eddy said to him.“It makes me sick to even think about it.”

“You better have a drink,”Johnson told him. Then he said to me,“Well, are we going out?”

“That's up to you.”

“What sort of a day will it be?”

“Just about like yesterday. Maybe better.”

“Let's get out then.”

“All right, as soon as the bait comes.”

We'd had this bird out three weeks fishing the stream and I hadn't seen any of his money yet except one hundred dollars he gave me to pay the consul and clear and get some grub and put gas in her before we came across. I was furnishing all the tackle and he had her chartered at thirty-five dollars a day. He slept at a hotel and came aboard every morning. Eddy got me the charter so I had to carry him. I was giving him four dollars a day.

“I've got to put gas in her,”I told Johnson.

“All right.”

“I'll need some money for that.”

“How much?”

“It's twenty-eight cents a gallon. I ought to put in forty gallons anyway. That's eleven-twenty.”

He got out fifteen dollars.

“Do you want to put the rest on the beer and the ice?”I asked him.

“That's fine,”he said.“Just put it down against what I owe you.”

I was thinking three weeks was a long time to let him go but if he was good for it what difference was there? He should have paid every week anyway. But I've let them run a month and got the money. It was my fault but I was glad to see it run at first. It was only the last few days he made me nervous but I didn't want to say anything for fear of getting him plugged at me. If he was good for it, the longer he went the better.

“Have a bottle of beer?”he asked me, opening the box.

“No thanks.”

Just then this nigger we had getting bait comes down the dock and I told Eddy to get ready to cast her off.

The nigger came on board with the bait and we cast off and started out of the harbor, the nigger fixing on a couple of mackerel; passing the hook through their mouth, out the gills, slitting the side and then putting the hook through the other side and out, tying the mouth shut on the wire leader and tying the hook good so it couldn't slip and so the bait would troll smooth without spinning.

He's a real black nigger, smart and gloomy, with blue voodoo beads around his neck under his shirt and an old straw hat. What he liked to do on board was sleep and read the papers. But he put on a nice bait and he was fast.

“Can't you put on a bait like that, Captain?”Johnson asked me.

“Yes, sir.”

“Why do you carry a nigger to do it?”

“When the big fish run you'll see,”I told him.

“What's the idea?”

“The nigger can do it faster than I can.”

“Can't Eddy do it?”

“No, sir.”

“It seems an unnecessary expense to me.”He'd been giving the nigger a dollar a day and the nigger had been on a rumba every night. I could see him getting sleepy already.

“He's necessary,”I said.

By then we had passed the smacks with their fish cars anchored in front of Cabañas and the skiffs anchored fishing for mutton fish on the rock bottom by the Morro, and I headed her out where the gulf made a dark line. Eddy put the two big teasers out and the nigger had baits on three rods.

The stream was in nearly to soundings and as we came toward the edge you could see her running nearly purple with regular whirlpools. There was a light east breeze coming up and we put up plenty of flying fish, those big ones that look like the picture of Lindbergh crossing the Atlantic when they sail off.

Those big flying fish are the best sign there is. As far as you could see, there was that faded yellow gulfweed in small patches that means the main stream is well in and there were birds ahead working over a school of little tuna. You could see them jumping; just little ones weighing a couple of pounds apiece.

“Put out any time you want,”I told Johnson.

He put on his belt and his harness and put out the big rod with the Hardy reel with six hundred yards of thirty-six thread. I looked back and his bait was trolling nice, just bouncing along on the swell and the two teasers were diving and jumping. We were going just about the right speed and I headed her into the stream.

“Keep the rod butt in the socket on the chair,”I told him.“Then the rod won't be as heavy. Keep the drag off so you can slack to him when he hits. If one ever hits with the drag on he'll jerk you overboard.”

Every day I'd have to tell him the same thing but I didn't mind that. One out of fifty parties you get know how to fish. Then when they do know, half the time they're goofy and want to use line that isn't strong enough to hold anything big.

“How does the day look?”he asked me.

“It couldn't be better,”I told him. It was a pretty day all right.

I gave the nigger the wheel and told him to work along the edge of the stream to the eastward and went back to where Johnson was sitting watching his bait bouncing along.

“Want me to put out another rod?”I asked him.

“I don't think so,”he said.“I want to hook, fight, and land my fish myself.”

“Good,”I said.“Do you want Eddy to put it out and hand it to you if one strikes so you can hook him?”

“No,”he said.“I prefer to have only one rod out.”

“All right.”

The nigger was still taking her out and I looked and saw he had seen a patch of flying fish burst out ahead and up the stream a little. Looking back, I could see Havana looking fine in the sun and a ship just coming out of the harbor past the Morro.

“I think you're going to have a chance to fight one today, Mr. Johnson,”I told him.

“It's about time,”he said.“How long have we been out?”

“Three weeks today.”

“That's a long time to fish.”

“They're a funny fish,”I told him.“They aren't here until they come. But when they come there's plenty of them. And they've always come. If they don't come now they're never coming. The moon is right. There's a good stream and we're going to have a good breeze.”

“There were some small ones when we first came.”

“Yes,”I said.“Like I told you. The small ones thin out and stop before the big ones come.”

“You party-boat captains always have the same line. Either it's too early or too late or the wind isn't right or the moon is wrong. But you take the money just the same.”

“Well,”I told him,“the hell of it is that it usually is too early or too late and plenty of time the wind is wrong. Then when you get a day that's perfect you're ashore without a party.”

“But you think today's a good day?”

“Well,”I told him,“I've had action enough for me already today. But I'd like to bet you're going to have plenty.”

“I hope so,”he said.

We settled down to troll. Eddy went forward and lay down. I was standing up watching for a tail to show. Every once in a while the nigger would doze off and I was watching him, too. I bet he had some nights.

“Would you mind getting me a bottle of beer, Captain?”Johnson asked me.

“No, sir,”I said, and I dug down in the ice to get him a cold one.

“Won't you have one?”he asked.

“No, sir,”I said.“I'll wait till tonight.”

I opened the bottle and was reaching it toward him when I saw this big brown bugger with a spear on him longer than your arm burst head and shoulders out of the water and smash at that mackerel. He looked as big around as a saw log.

“Slack it to him!”I yelled.

“He hasn't got it,”Johnson said.

“Hold it, then.”

He'd come up from deep down and missed it. I knew he'd turn and come for it again.

“Get ready to turn it loose to him the minute he grabs it.”

Then I saw him coming from behind under water. You could see his fins out wide like purple wings and the purple stripes across the brown. He came on like a submarine and his top fin came out and you could see it slice the water. Then he came right behind the bait and his spear came out too, sort of wagging clean out of water.

“Let it go into his mouth,”I said. Johnson took his hand off the reel spool and it started to whiz and the old marlin turned and went down and I could see the whole length of him shine bright silver as he turned broadside and headed off fast toward shore.

“Put on a little drag,”I said.“Not much.”

He screwed down on the drag.

“Not too much,”I said. I could see the line slant up.“Shut her down hard and sock him,”I said.“You've got to sock him. He's going to jump anyway.”

Johnson screwed the drag down and came back on the rod.

“Sock him,”I told him.“Stick it into him. Hit him half a dozen times.”

He hit him pretty hard a couple of times more, and then the rod bent double and the reel commenced to screech and out he came, boom, in a long straight jump, shining silver in the sun and making a splash like throwing a horse off a cliff.

“Ease up on the drag,”I told him.

“He's gone,”said Johnson.

“The hell he is,”I told him.“Ease up on the drag quick.”

I could see the curve in the line and the next time he jumped he was astern and headed out to sea. Then he came out again and smashed the water white and I could see he was hooked in the side of his mouth. The stripes showed clear on him. He was a fine fish, bright silver now, barred with purple and as big around as a log.

“He's gone,”Johnson said. The line was slack.

“Reel on him,”I said.“He's hooked good. Put her ahead with all the machine!”I yelled to the nigger.

Then once, twice, he came out stiff as a post, the whole length of him jumping straight toward us, throwing the water high each time he landed. The line came taut and I saw he was headed inshore again and I could see he was turning.

“Now he'll make his run,”I said.“If he hooks up I'll chase him. Keep your drag light. There's plenty of line.”

The old marlin headed out to the nor'west like all the big ones go, and brother, did he hook up. He started jumping in those long lopes and every splash would be like a speed boat in a sea. We went after him, keeping him on the quarter once I'd made the turn. I had the wheel and I kept yelling to Johnson to keep his drag light and reel fast. All of a sudden I see his rod jerk and the line go slack. It wouldn't look slack unless you knew about it because of the pull of the belly of the line in the water. But I knew.

“He's gone,”I told him. The fish was still jumping and he went on jumping until he was out of sight. He was a fine fish all right.

“I can still feel him pull,”Johnson said.

“That's the weight of the line.”

“I can hardly reel it. Maybe he's dead.”

“Look at him,”I said.“He's still jumping.”You could see him out a half a mile, still throwing spouts of water.

I felt his drag. He had it screwed down tight. You couldn't pull out any line. It had to break.

“Didn't I tell you to keep your drag light?”

“But he kept taking out line.”

“So what?”

“So I tightened it.”

“Listen,”I told him.“If you don't give them line when they hook up like that they break it. There isn't any line will hold them. When they want it you've got to give it to them. You have to keep a light drag. The market fishermen can't hold them tight when they do that even with a harpoon line. What we have to do is use the boat to chase them so they don't take it all when they make their run. After they make their run they'll sound and you can tighten up the drag and get it back.”

“Then if it hadn't broken I would have caught him?”

“You'd have had a chance.”

“He couldn't have kept that up, could he?”

“He can do plenty of other things. It isn't until after he's made his run that the fight starts.”

“Well, let's catch one,”he said.

“You have to reel that line in first,”I told him.

We'd hooked that fish and lost him without waking Eddy up. Now old Eddy came back astern.

“What's the matter?”he said.

Eddy was a good man on a boat once, before he got to be a rummy, but he isn't any good now. I looked at him standing there tall and hollowcheeked with his mouth loose and that white stuff in the corners of his eyes and his hair all faded in the sun. I knew he woke up dead for a drink.

“You'd better drink a bottle of beer,”I told him. He took one out of the box and drank it.

“Well, Mr. Johnson,”he said,“I guess I better finish my nap. Much obliged for the beer, sir.”Some Eddy. The fish didn't make any difference to him.

Well, we hooked another one around noon and he jumped off. You could see the hook go thirty feet in the air when he threw it.

“What did I do wrong then?”Johnson asked.

“Nothing,”I said.“He just threw it.”

“Mr. Johnson,”said Eddy, who'd waked up to have another bottle of beer—“Mr. Johnson, you're just unlucky. Now maybe you're lucky with women. Mr. Johnson, what do you say we go out tonight?”Then he went back and lay down again.

About four o'clock when we're coming back close in to shore against the stream, it going like a mill race, us with the sun at our backs, the biggest black marlin I ever saw in my life hit Johnson's bait. We'd put out a feather squid and caught four of those little tuna and the nigger put one on his hook for bait. It trolled pretty heavy but it made a big splash in the wake.

Johnson took the harness off the reel so he could put the rod across his knees because his arms got tired holding it in position all the time. Because his hands got tired holding the spool of the reel against the drag of the big bait, he screwed the drag down when I wasn't looking. I never knew he had it down. I didn't like to see him hold the rod that way but I hated to be crabbing at him all the time. Besides, with the drag off, line would go out so there wasn't any danger. But it was a sloppy way to fish.

I was at the wheel and was working the edge of the stream opposite that old cement factory where it makes deep so close in to shore and where it makes a son of eddy where there is always lots of bait. Then I saw a splash like a depth bomb and the sword and eye and open lower jaw and huge purple-black head of a black marlin. The whole top fin was up out of water looking as high as a full-rigged ship, and the whole scythe tall was out as he smashed at that tuna. The bill was as big around as a baseball bat and slanted up, and as he grabbed the bait he sliced the ocean wide open. He was solid purple-black and he had an eye as big as a soup bowl. He was huge. I bet he'd go a thousand pounds.

I yelled to Johnson to let him have line but before I could say a word I saw Johnson rise up in the air off the chair as though he was being derricked, and him holding just for a second onto that rod and the rod bending like a bow, and then the butt caught him in the belly and the whole works went overboard.

He'd screwed the drag tight, and when the fish struck, it lifted Johnson right out of the chair and he couldn't hold it. He'd had the butt under one leg and the rod across his lap. If he'd had the harness on it would have taken him along, too.

I cut out the engine and went back to the stern. He was sitting there holding onto his belly where the rod butt had hit him.

“I guess that's enough for today,”I said.

“What was it?”he said to me.

“Black marlin,”I said.

“How did it happen?”

“You figure it out,”I said.“The reel cost two hundred and fifty dollars. It costs more now. The rod cost me forty-five. There was a little under six hundred yards of thirty-six thread.”

Just then Eddy slaps him on the back.“Mr. Johnson,”he says,“you're just unlucky. You know I never saw that happen before in my life.”

“Shut up, you rummy,”I said to him.

“I tell you, Mr. Johnson,”Eddy said,“that's the rarest occurrence I ever saw in my life.”

“What would I do if I was hooked to a fish like that?”Johnson said.

“That's what you wanted to fight all by yourself,”I told him. I was plenty sore.

“They're too big,”Johnson said.“Why, it would just be punishment.”

“Listen,”I said.“A fish like that would kill you.”

“They catch them.”

“People who know how to fish catch them. But don't think they don't take punishment.”

“I saw a picture of a girl who caught one.”

“Sure,”I said.“Still fishing. He swallowed the bait and they pulled his stomach out and he came to the top and died. I'm talking about trolling them when they're hooked in the mouth.”

“Well,”said Johnson,“they're too big. If it isn't enjoyable, why do it?”

“That's right, Mr. Johnson,”Eddy said.“If it isn't enjoyable, why do it? Listen, Mr. Johnson. You hit the nail on the head there. If it isn't enjoyable—why do it?”

I was still shaky from seeing that fish and feeling plenty sick about the tackle and I couldn't listen to them. I told the nigger to head her for the Morro. I didn't say anything to them and there they sat, Eddy in one of the chairs with a bottle of beer and Johnson with another.

“Captain,”he said to me after a while,“could you make me a highball?”

I made him one without saying anything, and then I made myself a real one. I was thinking to myself that this Johnson had fished fifteen days, finally he hooks into a fish a fisherman would give a year to tie into, he loses him, he loses my heavy tackle, he makes a fool of himself and he sits there perfectly content drinking with a rummy.

When we got in to the dock and the nigger was standing there waiting, I said,“What about tomorrow?”

“I don't think so,”Johnson said.“I'm about fed up with this kind of fishing.”

“You want to pay off the nigger?”

“How much do I owe him?”

“A dollar. You can give him a tip if you want.”

So Johnson gave the nigger a dollar and two Cuban twenty-cent pieces.

“What's this for?”the nigger asks me, showing the coins.

“A tip,”I told him in Spanish.“You're through. He gives you that.”

“Don't come tomorrow?”

“No.”

The nigger gets his ball of twine he used for tying baits and his dark glasses, puts on his straw hat and goes without saying good-bye. He was a nigger that never thought much of any of us.

“When do you want to settle up, Mr. Johnson?”I asked him.

“I'll go to the bank in the morning,”Johnson said.“We can settle up in the afternoon.”

“Do you know how many days there are?”

“Fifteen.”

“No. There's sixteen with today and a day each way makes eighteen. Then there's the rod and reel and the line from today.”

“The tackle's your risk.”

“No, sir. Not when you lose it that way.”

“I've paid every day for the rent of it. It's your risk.”

“No, sir,”I said.“If a fish broke it and it wasn't your fault, that would be something else. You lost that whole outfit by carelessness.”

“The fish pulled it out of my hands.”

“Because you had the drag on and didn't have the rod in the socket.”

“You have no business to charge for that.”

“If you hired a car and ran it off a cliff, don't you think you'd have to pay for it?”

“Not if I was in it,”Johnson said.

“That's pretty good, Mr. Johnson,”Eddy said.“You see it, don't you, Cap? If he was in it he'd be killed. So he wouldn't have to pay. That's a good one.”

I didn't pay any attention to the rummy.“You owe two hundred and ninety five dollars for that rod and reel and line,”I told Johnson.

“Well, it's not right,”he said.“But if that's the way you feel about it why not split the difference?”

“I can't replace it for under three hundred and sixty. I'm not charging you for the line. A fish like that could get all your line and it not be your fault. If there was anyone here but a rummy they'd tell you how square I'm being with you. I know it seems like a lot of money but it was a lot of money when I bought the tackle, too. You can't fish like that without the best tackle you can buy.”

“Mr. Johnson, he says I'm a rummy. Maybe I am. But I tell you he's right. He's right and he's reasonable,”Eddy told him.

“I don't want to make any difficulties,”Johnson said finally.“I'll pay for it, even though I don't see it. That's eighteen days at thirty-five dollars and two ninety-five extra.”

“You gave me a hundred,”I told him.“I'll give you a list of what I spent and I'll deduct what grub there is left. What you bought for provisions going over and back.”

“That's reasonable,”Johnson said.

“Listen, Mr. Johnson,”Eddy said.“If you knew the way they usually charge a stranger you'd know it was more than reasonable. Do you know what it is? It's exceptional. The cap is treating you like you were his own mother.”

“I'll go to the bank tomorrow and come down in the afternoon. Then I'll get the boat day after tomorrow.”

“You can go back with us and save the boat fare.”

“No,”he said.“I'll save time with the boat.”

“Well,”I said.“What about a drink?”

“Fine,”said Johnson.“No hard feelings now, are there?”

“No, sir,”I told him. So the three of us sat there in the stern and drank a highball together.

The next day I worked around her all morning, changing the oil in her base and one thing and another. At noon I went uptown and ate at a Chink place where you get a good meal for forty cents, and then I bought some things to take home to my wife and our three girls. You know, perfume, a couple of fans and two of those high combs. When I finished I stopped in at Donovan's and had a beer and talked with the old man and then walked back to the San Francisco docks, stopping in at three or four places for a beer on the way. I bought Frankie a couple at the Cunard bar and I came on board feeling pretty good. When I came on board I had just forty cents left. Frankie came on board with me, and while we sat and waited for Johnson I drank a couple of cold ones out of the ice box with Frankie.

Eddy hadn't shown up all night or all day but I knew he would be around sooner or later, as soon as his credit ran out. Donovan told me he'd been in there the night before a little while with Johnson, and Eddy had been setting them up on credit. We waited and I began to wonder about Johnson not showing up. I'd left word at the dock for them to tell him to go on board and wait for me but they said he hadn't come. Still, I figured he had been out late and probably didn't get up till around noon. The banks were open until three-thirty. We saw the plane go out, and about five-thirty I was all over feeling good and was getting plenty worried.

At six o'clock I sent Frankie up to the hotel to see if Johnson was there. I still thought he might be out on a time or he might be there at the hotel feeling too bad to get up. I kept waiting and waiting until it was late. But I was getting plenty worried because he owed me eight hundred and twenty-five dollars.

Frankie was gone about a little over half an hour. When I saw him coming he was walking fast and shaking his head.

“He went on the plane,”he said.

All right. There it was. The consulate was closed. I had forty cents, and anyhow the plane was in Miami by now. I couldn't even send a wire. Some Mr. Johnson, all right. It was my fault. I should have known better.

“Well,”I said to Frankie,“we might as well have a cold one. Mr. Johnson bought them.”There were three bottles of Tropical left.

Frankie felt as bad as I did. I don't know how he could but he seemed to. He just kept slapping me on the back and shaking his head.

So there it was. I was broke. I'd lost five hundred and thirty dollars of the charter, and tackle I couldn't replace for three hundred and fifty more. How some of that gang that hangs around the dock would be pleased at that, I thought. It certainly would make some conchs happy. And the day before I turned down three thousand dollars to land three aliens on the Keys. Anywhere, just to get them out of the country.

All right, what was I going to do now? I couldn't bring in a load because you have to have money to buy the booze and besides there's no money in it any more. The town is flooded with it and there's nobody to buy it. But I was damned if I was going home broke and starve a summer in that town. Besides I've got a family. The clearance was paid when we came in. You usually pay the broker in advance and he enters you and clears you. Hell, I didn't even have enough money to put in gas. It was a hell of a note, all right. Some Mr. Johnson.

“I've got to carry something, Frankie,”I said.“I've got to make some money.”

“I'll see,”said Frankie. He hangs around the water front and does odd jobs and is pretty deaf and drinks too much every night. But you never saw a fellow more loyal nor with a better heart. I've known him since I first started to run over there. He used to help me load plenty of times. Then when I got handling stuff and went party-boating and broke out this sword fishing in Cuba I used to see him a lot around the dock and around the café. He seems dumb and he usually smiles instead of talking but that's because he's deaf.

“You carry anything?”Frankie asked.

“Sure,”I said.“I can't choose now.”

“Anything?”

“Sure.”

“I'll see,”Frankie said.“Where will you be?”

“I'll be at the Perla,”I told him.“I have to eat.”

You can get a good meal at the Perla for twenty-five cents. Everything on the menu is a dime except soup, and that is a nickel. I walked as far as there with Frankie, and I went in and he went on. Before he went he shook me by the hand and clapped me on the back again.

“Don't worry,”he said.“Me Frankie much politics. Much business. Much drinking. No money. But big friend. Don't worry.”

“So long, Frankie,”I said.“Don't you worry either, boy.”

I went in the Perla and sat down at a table. They had a new pane of glass in the window that had been shot up and the show case was all fixed up. There were a lot of gallegos drinking at the bar and some eating. One table was playing dominoes already. I had black bean soup and a beef stew with boiled potatoes for fifteen cents. A bottle of Hatuey beer brought it up to a quarter. When I spoke to the waiter about the shooting he wouldn't say anything. They were all plenty scared.

I finished the meal and sat back and smoked a cigarette and worried my head off. Then I saw Frankie coming in the door with someone behind him. Yellow stuff, I thought to myself. So it's yellow stuff.

“This is Mr. Sing,”Frankie said, and he smiled. He'd been pretty fast all right and he knew it.

“How do you do?”said Mr. Sing.

Mr. Sing was about the smoothest-looking thing I'd ever seen. He was a Chink all right, but he talked like an Englishman and he was dressed in a white suit with a silk shirt and black tie and one of those hundred-and-twenty-five-dollar Panama hats.

“You will have some coffee?”he asked me.

“If you do.”

“Thank you,”said Mr. Sing.“We are quite alone here?”

“Except for everybody in the café,”I told him.

“That is all right,”Mr. Sing said.“You have a boat?”

“Thirty-eight feet,”I said.“Hundred horse Kermath.”

“Ah,”said Mr. Sing.“I had imagined it was a lugger.”

“It can carry two hundred and sixty-five cases without being loaded.”

“Would you care to charter it to me?”

“On what terms?”

“You need not go. I will provide a captain and a crew.”

“No,”I said.“I go on her wherever she goes.”

“I see,”said Mr. Sing.“Would you mind leaving us?”he said to Frankie. Frankie looked as interested as ever and smiled at him.

“He's deaf,”I said.“He doesn't understand much English.”

“I see,”said Mr. Sing.“You speak Spanish. Tell him to rejoin us later.”

I motioned to Frankie with my thumb. He got up and went over to the bar.

“You don't speak Spanish?”I said.

“Oh, yes,”said Mr. Sing.“Now what are the circumstances that would—that have made you consider...”

“I'm broke.”

“I see,”said Mr. Sing.“Does the boat owe any money? Can she be libeled?”

“No.”

“Quite so,”Mr. Sing said.“How many of my unfortunate compatriots could your boat accommodate?”

“You mean carry?”

“That's it.”

“How far?”

“A day's voyage.”

“I don't know,”I said.“She can take a dozen if they didn't have any baggage.”

“They would not have baggage.”

“Where do you want to carry them?”

“I'd leave that to you,”Mr. Sing said.

“You mean where to land them?”

“You would embark them for the Tortugas where a schooner would pick them up.”

“Listen,”I said.“There's a lighthouse at the Tortugas on Loggerhead Key with a radio that works both ways.”

“Quite,”said Mr. Sing.“It would certainly be very silly to land them there.”

“Then what?”

“I said you would embark them for there. That is what their passage calls for.”

“Yes,”I said.

“You would land them wherever your best judgment dictated.”

“Will the schooner come to Tortugas to get them?”

“Of course not,”said Mr. Sing.“How silly.”

“How much are they worth a head?”

“Fifty dollars,”said Mr. Sing.

“No.”

“How would seventy-five do?”

“What do you get a head?”

“Oh, that's quite beside the point. You see, there are a great many facets, or shall we say angles, to my issuing the tickets. It doesn't stop there.”

“Yes,”I said.“And what I'm supposed to do doesn't have to be paid for, either. Eh?”

“I see your point absolutely,”said Mr. Sing.“Should we say a hundred dollars apiece?”

“Listen,”I said.“Do you know how long I would go to jail if they pick me up on this?”

“Ten years,”said Mr. Sing.“Ten years at least. But there is no reason to go to jail, my dear Captain. You run only one risk—when you load your passengers. Everything else is left to your discretion.”

“And if they come back on your hands?”

“That's quite simple. I would accuse you to them of having betrayed me. I will make a partial refund and ship them out again. They realize, of course, that it is a difficult voyage.”

“What about me?”

“I suppose I should send some word to the consulate.”

“I see.”

“Twelve hundred dollars, Captain, is not to be despised at present.”

“When would I get the money?”

“Two hundred when you agree and a thousand when you load.”

“If I would go off with the two hundred?”

“I could do nothing, of course,”he smiled.“But I know you wouldn't do such a thing, Captain.”

“Have you got the two hundred with you?”

“Of course.”

“Put it under the plate.”He did.“All right,”I said.“I'll clear in the morning and pull out at dark. Now, where do we load?”

“How would Bacuranao be?”

“All right. Have you got it fixed?”

“Of course.”

“Now, about the loading,”I said.“You show two lights, one above the other, at the point. I'll come in when I see them. You come out in a boat and load from the boat. You come yourself and you bring the money. I won't take one on board until I have it.”

“No,”he said;“one-half when you start to load and the other when you are finished.”

“All right,”I said.“That's reasonable.”

“So everything is understood?”

“I guess so,”I said.“There's no baggage and no arms. No guns, knives, or razors; nothing. I have to know about that.”

“Captain,”said Mr. Sing,“have you no trust in me? Don't you see our interests are identical?”

“You'll make sure?”

“Please do not embarrass me,”he said.“Do you not see how our interests coincide?”

“All right,”I told him.“What time will you be there?”

“Before midnight.”

“All right,”I said.“I guess that's all.”

“How do you want the money?”

“In hundreds is all right.”

He stood up and I watched him go out. Frankie smiled at him as he went. He was a smooth-looking Chink all right. Some Chink.

Frankie came over to the table.“Well?”he said.

“Where did you know Mr. Sing?”

“He ships Chinamen,”Frankie said.“Big business.”

“How long you know him?”

“He's here about two years,”Frankie said.“Another one ship them before him. Somebody kill him.”

“Somebody will kill Mr. Sing, too.”

“Sure,”said Frankie.“Why not? Plenty big business.”

“Some business,”I said.

“Big business,”said Frankie.“Ship Chinamen never come back. Other Chinamen write letters say everything fine.”

“Wonderful,”I said.

“This kind of Chinamen no understand write. Chinamen can write all rich. Eat nothing. Live on rice. Hundred thousand Chinamen here. Only three Chinese women.”

“Why?”

“Government no let.”

“Hell of a situation,”I said.

“You do business him?”

“Maybe.”

“Good business,”said Frankie.“Better than politics. Much money. Plenty big business.”

“Have a bottle of beer,”I told him.

“You not worry any more?”

“Hell no,”I said.“Plenty big business. Much obliged.”

“Good,”said Frankie and patted me on the back.“Make me happier than nothing. All I want is you happy. Chinamen good business, eh?”

“Wonderful.”

“Make me happy,”said Frankie. I saw he was about ready to cry because he was so pleased everything was all right, so I patted him on the back. Some Frankie.

First thing in the morning I got hold of the broker and told him to clear us. He wanted the crew list and I told him nobody.

“You're going to cross alone, Captain?”

“That's right.”

“What's become of your mate?”

“He's on a drunk,”I told him.

“It's very dangerous to go alone.”

“It's only ninety miles,”I said.“Do you think having a rummy on board makes any difference?”




I ran her over to the Standard Oil dock across the harbor and filled up both the tanks. She held nearly two hundred gallons when I had her full. I hated to buy it at twenty-eight cents a gallon but I didn't know where we might go.

Ever since I'd seen the Chink and taken the money I'd been worrying about the business. I don't think I slept all night. I brought her back to the San Francisco dock, and there was Eddy waiting on the dock for me.

“Hello, Harry,”he said to me and waved. I threw him the stern line and he made her fast, and then came aboard; longer, blearier, drunker than ever. I didn't say anything to him.

“What do you think about that fellow Johnson going off like that, Harry?”he asked me.“What do you know about that?”

“Get out of here,”I told him.“You're poison to me.”

“Brother, don't I feel as bad about it as you do?”

“Get off of her,”I told him.

He just settled back in the chair and stretched his legs out.“I hear we're going across today,”he said.“Well, I guess there isn't any use to stay around.”

“You're not going.”

“What's the matter, Harry? There's no sense to get plugged with me.”

“No? Get off her.”

“Oh, take it easy.”

I hit him in the face and he stood up and then climbed up onto the dock.

“I wouldn't do a thing like that to you, Harry,”he said.

“I'm not going to carry you,”I told him.“That's all.”

“Well, what did you have to hit me for?”

“So you'd believe it.”

“What do you want me to do? Stay here and starve?”

“Starve, hell,”I said.“You can get work on the ferry. You can work your way back.”

“You aren't treating me square,”he said.

“Who did you treat square, you rummy?”I told him.“You'd double-cross your own mother.”

That was true, too. But I felt bad about hitting him. You know how you feel when you hit a drunk. But I wouldn't carry him the way things were now, not even if I wanted to.

He started to walk off down the dock looking longer than a day without breakfast. Then he turned and came back.

“How's to let me take a couple of dollars, Harry?”

I gave him a five-dollar bill of the Chink's.

“I always knew you were my pal. Harry, why don't you carry me?”

“You're bad luck.”

“You're just plugged,”he said.“Never mind, old pal. You'll be glad to see me yet.”

Now he had money he went off a good deal faster but I tell you it was poison to see him walk, even. He walked just like his joints were backwards.

I went up to the Perla and met the broker and he gave me the papers and I bought him a drink. Then I had lunch and Frankie came in.

“Fellow gave me this for you,”he said and handed me a rolled-up sort of tube wrapped in paper and tied with a piece of red string. It looked like a photograph when I unwrapped it and I unrolled it thinking it was maybe a picture someone around the dock had taken of the boat.

All right. It was a close-up picture of the head and chest of a dead nigger with his throat cut clear across from ear to ear and then stitched up neat and a card on his chest saying in Spanish:“This is what we do to lenguas largas.”

“Who gave it to you?”I asked Frankie.

He pointed out a Spanish boy that works around the docks who is just about gone with the con. This kid was standing at the lunch counter.

“Ask him to come over.”

The kid came over. He said two young fellows gave it to him about eleven o'clock. They asked him if he knew me and he said yes. Then he gave it to Frankie for me. They gave him a dollar to see that I got it. They were well dressed, he said.

“Politics,”Frankie said.

“Oh, yes,”I said.

“They think you told the police you were meeting those boys here that morning.”

“Oh, yes.”

“Bad politics,”Frankie said.“Good thing you go.”

“Did they leave any message?”I asked the Spanish boy.

“No,”he said.“Just to give you that.”

“I'm going to have to leave now,”I said to Frankie.

“Bad politics,”Frankie said.“Very bad politics.”

I had all the papers in a bunch that the broker had given me and I paid the bill and walked out of that café and across the square and through the gate and I was plenty glad to come through the warehouse and get out on the dock. Those kids had me spooked all right. They were just dumb enough to think I'd tipped somebody off about that other bunch. Those kids were like Pancho. When they were scared they got excited, and when they got excited they wanted to kill somebody.

I got on board and warmed up the engine. Frankie stood on the dock watching. He was smiling that funny deaf smile. I went back to him.

“Listen,”I said.“Don't you get in any trouble about this.”

He couldn't hear me. I had to yell it at him.

“Me good politics,”Frankie said. He cast her off.

I waved to Frankie, who'd thrown the bowline on board, and I headed her out of the slip and dropped down the channel with her. A British freighter was going out and I ran along beside her and passed her. I went out the harbor and past the Morro and put her on the course for Key West; due north. I left the wheel and went forward and coiled up the bowline and then came back and held her on her course, spreading Havana out astern and then dropping it off behind us as we brought the mountains up.

I dropped the Morro out of sight after a while and then the National Hotel and finally I could just see the dome of the Capitol. There wasn't much current compared to the last day we had fished and there was only a light breeze. I saw a couple of smacks headed in toward Havana and they were coming from the westward so I knew the current was light.

I cut the switch and killed the motor. There wasn't any sense in wasting gas. I'd let her drift. When it got dark I could always pick up the light of the Morro or, if she drifted up too far, the lights of Cojimar, and steer in and run along to Bacuranao. I figured the way the current looked she would drift the twelve miles up to Bacuranao by dark and I'd see the lights of Baracóa.

Well, I killed the engine and climbed up forward to have a look around. All there was to see was the two smacks off to the westward headed in, and way back the dome of the Capitol standing up white out of the edge of the sea. There was some gulfweed on the stream and a few birds working, but not many. I sat up there awhile on top of the house and watched, but the only fish I saw were those little brown ones that rise around the gulfweed. Brother, don't let anybody tell you there isn't plenty of water between Havana and Key West. I was just on the edge of it.

After a while I went down into the cockpit again and there was Eddy!

“What's the matter? What's the matter with the engine?”

“She broke down.”

“Why haven't you got the hatch up?”

“Oh, hell!”I said.

Do you know what he'd done? He'd come back again and slipped the forward hatch and gone down into the cabin and gone to sleep. He had two quarts with him. He'd gone into the first bodega he'd seen and bought it and come aboard. When I started out he woke up and went back to sleep again. When I stopped her out in the gulf and she began to roll a little with the swell it woke him up.

“I knew you'd carry me, Harry,”he said.

“Carry you to hell,”I said.“You aren't even on the crew list. I've got a good mind to make you jump overboard now.”

“You're an old joker, Harry,”he said.“Us conchs ought to stick together when we're in trouble.”

“You,”I said,“with your mouth. Who's going to trust your mouth when you're hot?”

“I'm a good man, Harry. You put me to the test and see what a good man I am.”

“Get me the two quarts,”I told him. I was thinking of something else.

He brought them out and I took a drink from the open one and put them forward by the wheel. He stood there and I looked at him. I was sorry for him and for what I knew I'd have to do. Hell, I knew him when he was a good man.

“What's the matter with her, Harry?”

“She's all right.”

“What's the matter, then? What are you looking at me like that for?”

“Brother,”I told him, and I was sorry for him,“you're in plenty of trouble.”

“What do you mean, Harry?”

“I don't know yet,”I said.“I haven't got it all figured out yet.”

We sat there awhile and I didn't feel like talking to him any more. Once I knew it, it was hard to talk to him. Then I went below and got out the pump-gun and the Winchester thirty-thirty that I always had below in the cabin and hung them up in their cases from the top of the house where we hung the rods usually, right over the wheel where I could reach them. I keep them in those full-length clipped sheep's-wool cases soaked in oil. That's the only way you can keep them from rusting on a boat.

I loosened up the pump and worked her a few times, and then filled her up and pumped one into the barrel. I put a shell in the chamber of the Winchester and filled up the magazine. I got out the Smith and Wesson thirty-eight special I had when I was on the police force up in Miami from under the mattress and cleaned and oiled it and filled it up and put it on my belt.

“What's the matter?”Eddy said.“What the hell's the matter?”

“Nothing,”I told him.

“What's all the damn guns for?”

“I always carry them on board,”I said.“To shoot birds that bother the baits or to shoot sharks cruising along the keys.”

“What's the matter, damn it?”said Eddy.“What's the matter?”

“Nothing,”I told him. I sat there with the old thirty-eight flopping against my leg when she rolled, and I looked at him. I thought, there's no sense to do it now. I'm going to need him now.

“We're going to do a little job,”I said.“In at Bacuranao. I'll tell you what to do when it's time.”

I didn't want to tell him too far ahead because he would get to worrying and get so spooked he wouldn't be any use.

“You couldn't have anybody better than me, Harry,”he said.“I'm the man for you. I'm with you on anything.”

I looked at him, tall and bleary and shaky, and I didn't say anything.

“Listen, Harry. Would you give me just one?”he asked me.“I don't want to get the shakes.”

I gave him one and we sat and waited for it to get dark. It was a fine sunset and there was a nice light breeze, and when the sun got pretty well down I started the engine and headed her in slow toward land.

We lay offshore about a mile in the dark. The current had freshened up with the sun down and I noticed it running in. I could see the Morro light way down to the westward and the glow of Havana, and the lights opposite us were Rincón and Baracóa. I headed her up against the current until I was past Bacuranao and nearly to Cojimar. Then I let her drift down. It was plenty dark but I could tell good where we were. I had all the lights out.

“What's it going to be, Harry?”Eddy asked me. He was beginning to be spooked again.

“What do you think?”

“I don't know,”he said.“You've got me worried.”He was pretty close to the shakes and when he came near me he had a breath like a buzzard.

“What time is it?”

“I'll go down and see,”he said. He came back up and said it was half past nine.

“Are you hungry?”I asked him.

“No,”he said.“You know I couldn't eat, Harry.”

“All right,”I told him.“You can have one.”

After he had it I asked him how he felt. He said he felt fine.

“I'm going to give you a couple more in a little while,”I told him.“I know you haven't got any guts unless you've got rum and there isn't much on board. So you'd better go easy.”

“Tell me what's up,”said Eddy.

“Listen,”I said, talking to him in the dark.“We're going in to Bacuranao and pick up twelve Chinks. You take the wheel when I tell you to and do what I tell you to. We'll take the twelve Chinks on board and we'll lock them below forward. Go on forward now and fasten the hatch from the outside.”

He went up and I saw him shadowed against the dark. He came back and he said,“Harry, can I have one of those now?”

“No,”I said.“I want you rum-brave. I don't want you useless.”

“I'm a good man, Harry. You'll see.”

“You're a rummy,”I said.“Listen. One Chink is going to bring those twelve out. He's going to give me some money at the start. When they're all on board he's going to give me some more money. When you see him start to hand me money the second time you put her ahead and hook her up and head her out to sea. Don't you pay any attention to what happens. You keep her going out no matter what happens. Do you understand?”

“Yes.”

“If any Chink starts bursting out of the cabin or coming through the hatch, once we're out and under way, you take that pump-gun and blow them back as fast as they come out. Do you know how to use the pump-gun?”

“No. But you can show me.”

“You'd never remember. Do you know how to use the Winchester?”

“Just pump the lever and shoot it.”

“That's right,”I said.“Only don't shoot any holes in the hull.”

“You'd better give me that other drink,”Eddy said.

“All right. I'll give you a little one.”

I gave him a real one. I knew they wouldn't make him drunk now; not pouring into all that fear. But each one would work for a little while. After he drank this Eddy said, just as though he was happy,“So we're going to run Chinks. Well, by God, I always said I'd run Chinamen if I was ever broke.”

“But you never got broke before, eh?”I said to him. He was funny all right.

I gave him three more drinks to keep him brave before it was half past ten. It was funny watching him and it kept me from thinking about it myself. I hadn't figured on all this wait. I'd planned to leave after dark, run out, just out of the glare, and coast along to Cojimar.

At a little before eleven I saw the two lights show on the point. I waited a little while and then I took her in slow. Bacuranao is a cove where there used to be a big dock for loading sand. There is a little river that comes in when the rains open the bar across the mouth. The northers, in the winter, pile the sand up and close it.

They used to go in with schooners and load guavas from the river and there used to be a town. But the hurricane took it and it is all gone now except one house that some gallegos built out of the shacks the hurricane blew down and that they use for a clubhouse on Sundays when they come out to swim and picnic from Havana. There is one other house where the delegate lives but it is back from the beach.

Each little place like that all down the coast has a government delegate, but I figured the Chink must use his own boat and have him fixed. As we came in I could smell the sea grape and that sweet smell from the brush you get off the land.

“Get up forward,”I said to Eddy.

“You can't hit anything on that side,”he said.“The reef's on the other side as you go in.”You see, he'd been a good man once.

“Watch her,”I said, and I took her in to where I knew they could see us. With no surf they could hear the engine. I didn't want to wait around, not knowing whether they saw us or not, so I flashed the running lights on once, just the green and red, and turned them off. Then I turned her and headed her out and let her lay there, just outside, with the engine just ticking. There was quite a little swell that close in.

“Come on back here,”I said to Eddy and I gave him a real drink.

“Do you cock it first with your thumb?”he whispered to me. He was sitting at the wheel now, and I had reached up and had both the cases open and the butts pulled out about six inches.

“That's right.”

“Oh boy,”he said.

It certainly was wonderful what a drink would do to him and how quick.

We lay there and I could see a light from the delegate's house back through the bush. I saw the two lights on the point go down, and one of them moving off around the point. They must have blown the other one out.

Then, in a little while, coming out of the cove, I see a boat come toward us with a man sculling. I could tell by the way he swung back and forth. I knew he had a big oar. I was pretty pleased. If they were sculling that meant one man.

They came alongside.

“Good evening, Captain,”said Mr. Sing.

“Come astern and put her broadside,”I said to him.

He said something to the man who was sculling but he couldn't scull her backwards, so I took hold of the gunwale and passed her astern. There were eight men in the boat. The six Chinks, Mr. Sing, and the kid sculling. While I was pulling her astern I was waiting for something to hit me on top of the head but nothing did. I straightened up and let Mr. Sing hold onto the stern.

“Let's see what it looks like,”I said.

He handed it to me and I took it up to where Eddy was at the wheel and put on the binnacle light. I looked at it carefully. It looked all right to me and I turned off the light. Eddy was trembling.

“Pour one yourself,”I said. I saw him reach for the bottle and tip it up.

I went back to the stern.

“All right,”I said.“Let six come on board.”

Mr. Sing and the Cuban that sculled were having a job holding their boat from knocking in what little swell there was. I heard Mr. Sing say something in Chink and all the Chinks in the boat started to climb onto the stern.

“One at a time,”I said.

He said something again, and then one after another six Chinks came over the stern. They were all lengths and sizes.

“Show them forward,”I said to Eddy.

“Right this way, gentlemen,”said Eddy. By God, I knew he had taken a big one.

“Lock the cabin,”I said, when they were all in.

“Yes, sir,”said Eddy.

“I will return with the others,”said Mr. Sing.

“O.K.,”I told him.

I pushed them clear and the boy with him started sculling off.

“Listen,”I said to Eddy.“You lay off that bottle. You're brave enough now.”

“O.K., chief,”said Eddy.

“What's the matter with you?”

“This is what I like to do,”said Eddy.“You say you just pull it backward with your thumb?”

“You lousy rummy,”I told him.“Give me a drink out of that.”

“All gone,”said Eddy.“Sorry, chief.”

“Listen. What you have to do now is watch her when he hands me the money and put her ahead.”

“O.K., chief,”said Eddy.

I reached up and took the other bottle and got the corkscrew and drew the cork. I took a good drink and went back to the stem, putting the cork in tight and laying the bottle behind two wicker jugs full of water.

“Here comes Mr. Sing,”I said to Eddy.

“Yes, sir,”said Eddy.

The boat came out sculling toward us.

He brought her astern and I let them do the holding in. Mr. Sing had hold of the roller we had across the stern to slide a big fish on board.

“Let them come aboard,”I said,“one at a time.”

Six more assorted Chinks came on board over the stern.

“Open up and show them forward,”I told Eddy.

“Yes, sir,”said Eddy.

“Lock the cabin.”

“Yes, sir.”

I saw he was at the wheel.

“All right, Mr. Sing,”I said.“Let's see the rest of it.”

He put his hand in his pocket and reached the money out toward me. I reached for it and grabbed his wrist with the money in his hand, and as he came forward on the stern I grabbed his throat with the other hand. I felt her start and then churn ahead as she hooked up and I was plenty busy with Mr. Sing but I could see the Cuban standing in the stem of the boat holding the sculling oar through all the flopping and bouncing Mr. Sing was doing. He was flopping and bouncing worse than any dolphin on a gaff.

I got his arm around behind him and came up on it but I brought it too far because I felt it go. When it went he made a funny little noise and came forward, me holding him throat and all, and bit me on the shoulder. But when I felt the arm go I dropped it. It wasn't any good to him any more and I took him by the throat with both hands, and brother, that Mr. Sing would flop just like a fish, true, his loose arm flailing, but I got him forward onto his knees and had both thumbs well in behind his talk box and I bent the whole thing back until she cracked. Don't think you can't hear it crack, either.

I held him quiet just a second, and then I laid him down across the stem. He lay there, face up, quiet, in his good clothes, with his feet in the cockpit, and I left him.

I picked up the money off the cockpit floor and took it up and put it on the binnacle and counted it. Then I took the wheel and told Eddy to look under the stem for some pieces of iron that I used for anchoring whenever we fished bottom fishing on patches or rocky bottom where you wouldn't want to risk an anchor.

“I can't find anything,”he said. He was scared being down there by Mr. Sing.

“Take the wheel,”I said.“Keep her out.”

There was a certain amount of moving around going on below but I wasn't spooked about them.

I found a couple of pieces of what I wanted—iron from the old coaling dock at Tortugas—and I took some snapper line and made a couple of good big pieces fast to Mr. Sing's ankles. Then when we were about two miles offshore I slid him over. He slid over smooth off the roller. I never even looked in his pockets. I didn't feel like fooling with him.

He'd bled a little on the stern from his nose and his mouth, and I dipped a bucket of water that nearly pulled me overboard the way we were going, and cleaned her off good with a scrub brush from under the stern.

“Slow her down,”I said to Eddy.

“What if he floats up?”Eddy said.

“I dropped him in about seven hundred fathoms,”I said.“He's going down all that way. That's a long way, brother. He won't float till the gas brings him up and all the time he's going with the current and baiting up fish. Hell,”I said,“you don't have to worry about Mr. Sing.”

“What did you have against him?”Eddy asked me.

“Nothing,”I said.“He was the easiest man to do business with I ever met. I thought there must be something wrong all the time.”

“What did you kill him for?”

“To keep from killing twelve other Chinks,”I told him.

“Harry,”he said,“you've got to give me one because I can feel them coming on. It made me sick to see his head all loose like that.”

So I gave him one.

“What about the Chinks?”Eddy said.

“I want to get them out as quick as I can,”I told him.“Before they smell up the cabin.”

“Where are you going to put them?”

“We'll run them right in to the long beach,”I told him.

“Take her in now?”

“Sure,”I said.“Take her in slow.”

We came in slow over the reef and to where I could see the beach shine. There is plenty of water over the reef and inside it's all sandy bottom and slopes right in to shore.

“Get up forward and give me the depth.”

He kept sounding with a grains pole, motioning me on with the pole. He came back and motioned me to stop. I came astern on her.

“You've got about five feet.”

“We've got to anchor,”I said.“If anything happens so we haven't time to get her up, we can cut loose or break her off.”

Eddy paid out rope and when finally she didn't drag he made her fast. She swung stern in.

“It's sandy bottom, you know,”he said.

“How much water have we got at the stern?”

“Not over five feet.”

“You take the rifle,”I said.“And be careful,”

“Let me have one,”he said. He was plenty nervous.

I gave him one and took down the pump-gun. I unlocked the cabin door, opened it, and said:“Come on out.”

Nothing happened.

Then one Chink put his head out and saw Eddy standing there with a rifle and ducked back.

“Come on out. Nobody's going to hurt you,”I said.

Nothing doing. Only lots of talk in Chink.

“Come on out, you!”Eddy said. My God, I knew he'd had the bottle.

“Put that bottle away,”I said to him,“or I'll blow you out of the boat.”

“Come on out,”I said to them,“or I'll shoot in at you.”

I saw one of them looking at the corner of the door and he saw the beach evidently because he begins to chatter.

“Come on,”I said,“or I'll shoot.”

Out they came.

Now I tell you it would take a hell of a mean man to butcher a bunch of Chinks like that and I'll bet there would be plenty of trouble, too, let alone mess.

They came out and they were scared and they didn't have any guns but there were twelve of them. I walked backwards down to the stem holding the pump gun.“Get overboard,”I said.“It's not over your heads.”

Nobody moved.

“Over you go.”

Nobody moved.

“You yellow rat-eating aliens,”Eddy said,“get overboard.”

“Shut your drunken mouth,”I told him.

“No swim,”one Chink said.

“No need swim,”I said.“No deep.”

“Come on, get overboard,”Eddy said.

“Come astern here,”I said.“Take your gun in one hand and your grains pole in the other and show them how deep it is.”

He showed them.

“No need swim?”the one asked me.

“No.”

“True?”

“Yes.”

“Where we?”

“Cuba.”

“You damn crook,”he said and went over the side, hanging on and then letting go. His head went under but he came up and his chin was out of water.“Damn crook,”he said.“Damn crook.”

He was mad and he was plenty brave. He said something in Chink and the others started going into the water off the stern.

“All right,”I said to Eddy.“Get the anchor up.”

As we headed her out, the moon started to come up and you could see the Chinks with just their heads out of water walking ashore, and the shine of the beach and the brush behind.

We got out past the reef and I looked back once and saw the beach and the mountains starting to show up; then I put her on her course for Key West.

“Now you can take a sleep,”I said to Eddy.“No, wait, go below and open up all the ports to get the stink out and bring me the iodine.”

“What's the matter?”he said when he brought it.

“I cut my finger.”

“Do you want me to steer?”

“Get a sleep,”I said.“I'll wake you up.”

He lay down on the built-in bunk in the cockpit, over the gas tank, and in a little while he was asleep.

I held the wheel with my knee and opened up my shirt and saw where Mr. Sing bit me. It was quite a bite and I put iodine on it, and then I sat there steering and wondering whether a bite from a Chinaman was poisonous and listened to her running nice and smooth and the water washing along her and I figured, Hell no, that bite wasn't poisonous. A man like that Mr. Sing probably scrubbed his teeth two or three times a day. Some Mr. Sing. He certainly wasn't much of a business man. Maybe he was. Maybe he just trusted me. I tell you I couldn't figure him.

Well, now it was all simple except for Eddy. Because he's a rummy he'll talk when he gets hot. I sat there steering and I looked at him and I thought, Hell, he's as well off dead as the way he is, and then I'm all clear. When I found he was on board I decided I'd have to do away with him but then when everything had come out so nice I didn't have the heart. But looking at him lying there it certainly was a temptation. But then I thought there's no sense spoiling it by doing something you'd be sorry for afterwards. Then I started to think he wasn't even on the crew list and I'd have a fine to pay for bringing him in and I didn't know how to consider him.

Well, I had plenty of time to think about it and I held her on her course and every once in a while I'd take a drink out of the bottle he'd brought on board. There wasn't much in it, and when I'd finished it, I opened up the only one I had left, and I tell you I felt pretty good steering, and it was a pretty night to cross. It had turned out a good trip all right, finally, even though it had looked plenty bad plenty of times.

When it got daylight Eddy woke up. He said he felt terrible.

“Take the wheel a minute,”I told him.“I want to look around.”

I went back to the stem and threw a little water on her. But she was perfectly clean. I scrubbed the brush over the side. I unloaded the guns and stowed them below. But I still kept the gun on my belt. It was fresh and nice as you want it below, no smell at all. A little water had come in through the starboard port onto one of the bunks was all; so I shut the ports. There wasn't a customhouse officer in the world could smell Chink in her now.

I saw the clearance papers in the net bag hanging up under her framed license where I'd shoved them when I came on board and I took them out to look them over. Then I went up to the cockpit.

“Listen,”I said.“How did you get on the crew list?”

“I met the broker when he was leaving for the consulate and told him I was going.”

“God looks after rummies,”I told him and I took the thirty-eight off and stowed it down below.

I made some coffee down below and then I came up and took the wheel.

“There's coffee below,”I told him.

“Brother, coffee wouldn't do me any good.”You knew you had to be sorry for him. He certainly looked bad.

About nine o'clock we saw the Sand Key light just about dead ahead. We'd seen tankers going up the gulf for quite a while.

“We'll be in now,”I said to him.“I'm going to give you the same four dollars a day just as if Johnson had paid.”

“How much did you get out of last night?”he asked me.

“Only six hundred,”I told him.

I don't know whether he believed me or not.

“Don't I share in it?”

“That's your share,”I told him.“What I just told you, and if you ever open your mouth about last night I'll hear of it and I'll do away with you.”

“You know I'm no squealer, Harry.”

“You're a rummy. But no matter how rum dumb you get, if you ever talk about that, I promise you.”

“I'm a good man,”he said.“You oughtn't to talk to me like that.”

“They can't make it fast enough to keep you a good man,”I told him. But I didn't worry about him any more, because who was going to believe him? Mr. Sing wouldn't make any complaints. The Chinks weren't going to. You know the boy that sculled them out wasn't. Eddy would mouth about it sooner or later, maybe, but who believes a rummy?

Why, who could prove anything? Naturally it would have made plenty more talk when they saw his name on the crew list. That was luck for me, all right. I could have said he fell overboard, but it makes plenty talk. Plenty of luck for Eddy, too. Plenty of luck, all right.

Then we came to the edge of the stream and the water quit being blue and was light and greenish and inside I could see the stakes on the Long Reef and on the Western Dry Rocks and the wireless masts at Key West and the La Concha hotel up high out of all the low houses and plenty smoke from out where they're burning garbage. Sand Key light was plenty close now and you could see the boathouse and the little dock alongside the light and I knew we were only forty minutes away now and I felt good to be getting back and I had a good stake now for the summertime.

“What do you say about a drink, Eddy?”I said to him.

“Ah, Harry,”he said,“I always knew you were my pal.”





The Denunciation


Chicote's in the old days in Madrid was a place sort of like The Stork, without the music and the debutantes, or the Waldorf's men's bar if they let girls in. You know, they came in, but it was a man's place and they didn't have any status. Pedro Chicote was the proprietor and he had one of those personalities that make a place. He was a great bartender and he was always pleasant, always cheerful, and he had a lot of zest. Now zest is a rare enough thing and few people have it for long. It should not be confused with showmanship either. Chicote had it and it was not faked or put on. He was also modest, simple and friendly. He really was as nice and pleasant and still as marvelously efficient as George, the chasseur at the Ritz bar in Paris, which is about the strongest comparison you can make to anyone who has been around, and he ran a fine bar.

In those days the snobs among the rich young men of Madrid hung out at something called the Nuevo Club and the good guys went to Chicote's. A lot of people went there that I did not like, the same as at The Stork, say, but I was never in Chicote's that it wasn't pleasant. One reason was that you did not talk politics there. There were cafés where you went for politics and nothing else but you didn't talk politics at Chicote's. You talked plenty of the other five subjects though and in the evening the best looking girls in the town showed up there and it was the place to start an evening from, all right, and we had all started some fine ones from there.

Then it was the place where you dropped in to find out who was in town, or where they had gone to if they were out of town. And if it was summer, and there was no one in town, you could always sit and enjoy a drink because the waiters were all pleasant.

It was a club only you didn't have to pay any dues and you could pick a girl up there. It was the best bar in Spain, certainly, and I think one of the best bars in the world, and all of us that used to hang out there had a great affection for it.

Another thing was that the drinks were wonderful. If you ordered a martini it was made with the best gin that money could buy, and Chicote had a barrel whisky that came from Scotland that was so much better than the advertised brands that it was pitiful to compare it with ordinary Scotch. Well, when the revolt started, Chicote was up at San Sebastian running the summer place he had there. He is still running it and they say it is the best bar in Franco's Spain. The waiters took over the Madrid place and they are still running it, but the good liquor is all gone now.

Most of Chicote's old customers are on Franco's side; but some of them are on the Government side. Because it was a very cheerful place, and because really cheerful people are usually the bravest, and the bravest get killed quickest, a big part of Chicote's old customers are now dead. The barrel whisky had all been gone for many months now and we finished the last of the yellow gin in May of 1938. There's not much there to go for now so I suppose Luis Delgado, if he had come to Madrid a little later, might have stayed away from there and not gotten into that trouble. But when he came to Madrid in the month of November of 1937 they still had the yellow gin and they still had Indian quinine water. They do not seem worth risking your life for, so maybe he just wanted to have a drink in the old place. Knowing him, and knowing the place in the old days, it would be perfectly understandable.

They had butchered a cow at the Embassy that day and the porter had called up at the Hotel Florida to tell us that they had saved us ten pounds of fresh meat. I walked over to get it through the early dusk of a Madrid winter. Two assault guards with rifles sat on chairs outside the Embassy gate and the meat was waiting at the porter's lodge.

The porter said it was a very good cut but that the cow was lean. I offered him some roasted sunflower seeds and some acorns from the pocket of my mackinaw jacket and we joked a little standing outside the lodge on the gravel of the Embassy driveway.

I walked home across the town with the meat heavy under my arm. They were shelling up the Gran Via and I went into Chicote's to wait it out. It was noisy and crowded and I sat at a little table in one corner against the sandbagged window with the meat on the bench beside me and drank a gin and tonic water. It was that week that we discovered they still had tonic water. No one had ordered any since the war started and it was still the same price as before the revolt. The evening papers were not yet out so I bought three party tracts from an old woman. They were ten centavos apiece and I told her to keep the change from a peseta. She said God would bless me. I doubted this but read the three leaflets and drank the gin and tonic.

A waiter I had known in the old days came over to the table and said something to me.

“No,”I said.“I don't believe it.”

“Yes,”he insisted, slanting his tray and his head in the same direction.“Don't look now. There he is.”

“It's not my business,”I told him.

“Nor mine either.”

He went away and I bought the evening papers which had just come in from another old woman and read them. There was no doubt about the man the waiter had pointed out. We both knew him very well. All I could think was: the fool. The utter bloody fool.

Just then a Greek comrade came over and sat down at the table. He was a company commander in the Fifteenth Brigade who had been buried by an airplane bomb which had killed four other men and he had been sent in to be under observation for a while and then sent to a rest home or something of the sort.

“How are you, John?”I asked him.“Try one of these.”

“What you call that drink, Mr. Emmunds?”

“Gin and tonic.”

“What is that kind of tonic?”

“Quinine. Try one.”

“Listen, I don't drink very much but is a quinine very good for fever. I try little one.”

“What did the doctor say about you, John?”

“Is a no necessity see doctor. I am all right. Only I have like buzzing noises all the time in the head.”

“You have to go to see him, John.”

“I go all right. But he not understand. He says I have no papers to admit.”

“I'll call up about it,”I said.“I know the people there. Is the doctor a German?”

“That's right,”said John.“Is a German. No talk English very good.”

Just then the waiter came over. He was an old man with a bald head and very old-fashioned manners which the war had not changed. He was very worried.

“I have a son at the front,”he said.“I have another son killed. Now about this.”

“It is thy problem.”

“And you? Already I have told you.”

“I came in here to have a drink before eating.”

“And I work here. But tell me.”

“It is thy problem,”I said.“I am not a politician.”

“Do you understand Spanish, John?”I asked the Greek comrade.

“No, I understand few words but I speak Greek, English, Arabic. One time I speak good Arabic. Listen, you know how I get buried?”

“No. I knew you were buried. That's all.”

He had a dark good-looking face and very dark hands that he moved about when he talked. He came from one of the islands and he spoke with great intensity.

“Well, I tell you now. You see I have very much experience in war. Before I am captain in Greek army too. I am good soldier. So when I see plane come over there when we are in trenches there at Fuentes del Ebro I look at him close. I look at plane come over, bank, turn like this”(he turned and banked with his hands),“look down on us and I say,‘Ah ha. Is for the General Staff. Is made the observation. Pretty soon come others.’

“So just like I say come others. So I am stand there and watch. I watch close. I look up and I point out to company what happens. Is come three and three. One first and two behind. Is pass one group of three and I say to company,‘See? Now is pass one formation.’

“Is pass the other three and I say to company,‘Now is hokay. Now is all right. Now is nothing more to worry.’That the last thing I remember for two weeks.”

“When did it happen?”

“About one month ago. You see is my helmet forced down over my face when am buried by bomb so I have the air in that helmet to breathe until they dig me out but I know nothing about that. But in that air I breathe is the smoke from the explosion and that make me sick for long time. Now am I hokay, only with the ringing in the head. What you call this drink?”

“Gin and tonic. Schweppes Indian tonic water. This was a very fancy café before the war and this used to cost five pesetas when there were only seven pesetas to the dollar. We just found out they still have the tonic water and they're charging the same price for it. There's only a case left.”

“Is a good drink all right. Tell me, how was this city before the war?”

“Fine. Like now only lots to eat.”

The waiter came over and leaned toward the table.

“And if I don't?”he said.“It is my responsibility.”

“If you wish to, go to the telephone and call this number. Write it down.”

He wrote it down.“Ask for Pepé,”I said.

“I have nothing against him,”the waiter said.“But it is the Causa. Certainly such a man is dangerous to our cause.”

“Don't the other waiters recognize him?”

“I think so. But no one has said anything. He is an old client.”

“I am an old client, too.”

“Perhaps then he is on our side now, too.”

“No,”I said.“I know he is not.”

“I have never denounced anyone.”

“It is your problem. Maybe one of the other waiters will denounce him.”

“No. Only the old waiters know him and the old waiters do not denounce.”

“Bring another of the yellow gins and some bitters,”I said.“There is tonic water still in the bottle.”

“What's he talk about?”asked John.“I only understand little bit.”

“There is a man here that we both knew in the old days. He used to be a marvelous pigeon shot and I used to see him at shoots. He is a fascist and for him to come here now, no matter what his reasons, is very foolish. But he was always very brave and very foolish.”

“Show him to me.”

“There at that table with the flyers.”

“Which one?”

“With the very brown face; the cap over one eye. Who is laughing now.”

“He is fascist?”

“Yes.”

“That's a closest I see fascist since Fuentes del Ebro. Is a many fascist here?”

“Quite a few from time to time.”

“Is drink the same drink as you,”said John.“We drink that other people think we fascists, eh? Listen you ever been South America, West Coast, Magallanes?”

“No.”

“Is all right. Only too many oc-toe-pus.”

“Too many what?”

“Oc-toe-pus.”He pronounced it with the accent on the toe as oc-toe-pus.“You know with the eight arms.”

“Oh,”I said.“Octopus.”

“Oc-toe-pus,”said John.“You see I am diver too. Is a good place to work all right make plenty money only too many oc-toe-pus.”

“Did they bother you?”

“I don't know about that. First time I go down in Magallanes harbor I see oc-toe-pus. He is stand on his feet like this.”John pointed his fingers on the table and brought his hands up, at the same time bringing up his shoulders and raising his eyebrows.“He is stand up taller than I am and he is look me right in the eye. I jerk cord for them to bring me up.”

“How big was he, John?”

“I cannot say absolutely because the glass in the helmet make distort a little. But the head was big around more than four feet anyway. And he was stand on his feet like on tip-toes and look at me like this.”(He peered in my face.)“So when I get up out of water they take off the helmet and so I say I don't go down there any more. Then the man of the job says,‘What a matter with you, John? The oc-toe-pus is more afraid of you than you afraid of oc-toe-pus.’So I say to him‘Impossible!’What you say we drink some more this fascist drink?”

“All right,”I said.

I was watching the man at the table. His name was Luis Delgado and the last time I had seen him had been in 1933 shooting pigeons at Saint Sebastian and I remembered standing with him up on top of the stand watching the final of the big shoot. We had a bet, more than I could afford to bet, and I believed a good deal more than he could afford to lose that year, and when he paid coming down the stairs, I remembered how pleasant he was and how he made it seem a great privilege to pay. Then I remembered our standing at the bar having a martini, and I had that wonderful feeling of relief that comes when you have bet yourself out of a bad hole and I was wondering how badly the bet had hit him. I had shot rottenly all week and he had shot beautifully but drawn almost impossible birds and he had bet on himself steadily.

“Should we match a duro?”he asked.

“You really want to?”

“Yes, if you like.”

“For how much?”

He took out a notecase and looked in it and laughed.

“I'd say for anything you like,”he said.“But suppose we say for eight thousand pesetas. That's what seems to be there.”

That was close to a thousand dollars then.

“Good,”I said, all the fine inner quiet gone now and the hollow that gambling makes come back again.“Who's matching who?”

“I'll match you.”

We shook the heavy five-peseta pieces in our cupped hands; then each man laid his coin on the back of his left hand, each coin covered with the right hand.

“What's yours?”he asked.

I uncovered the big silver piece with the profile of Alfonso XIII as a baby showing.

“Heads,”I said.

“Take these damned things and be a good man and buy me a drink.”He emptied out the notecase.“You wouldn't like to buy a good Purdey gun would you?”

“No,”I said.“But look, Luis, if you need some money—”

I was holding the stiffly folded, shiny-heavy-paper, green thousandpeseta notes toward him.

“Don't be silly, Enrique,”he said.“We've been gambling, haven't we?”

“Yes. But we know each other quite well.”

“Not that well.”

“Right,”I said.“You're the judge of that. Then what will you drink?”

“What about a gin and tonic? That's a marvelous drink you know.”

So we had a gin and tonic and I felt very badly to have broken him and I felt awfully good to have won the money, and a gin and tonic never tasted better to me in all my life. There is no use to lie about these things or pretend you do not enjoy winning; but this boy Luis Delgado was a very pretty gambler.

“I don't think if people gambled for what they could afford it would be very interesting. Do you, Enrique?”

“I don't know. I've never been able to afford it.”

“Don't be silly. You have lots of money.”

“No I haven't,”I said.“Really.”

“Oh, everyone has money,”he said.“It's just a question of selling something or other to get hold of it.”

“I don't have much. Really.”

“Oh, don't be silly. I've never known an American who wasn't rich.”

I guess that was the truth all right. He wouldn't have met them at the Ritz bar or at Chicote's either in those days. And now he was back in Chicote's and all the Americans he would meet there now were the kind he would never have met; except me, and I was a mistake. But I would have given plenty not to have seen him in there.

Still, if he wanted to do an absolutely damn fool thing like that it was his own business. But as I looked at the table and remembered the old days I felt badly about him and I felt very badly too that I had given the waiter the number of the counterespionage bureau in Seguridad headquarters. He could have had Seguridad by simply asking on the telephone. But I had given him the shortest cut to having Delgado arrested in one of those excesses of impartiality, righteousness and Pontius Pilatry, and the always-dirty desire to see how people act under an emotional conflict, that makes writers such attractive friends.

The waiter came over.

“What do you think?”he asked.

“I would never denounce him myself,”I said, now trying to undo for myself what I had done with the number.“But I am a foreigner and it is your war and your problem.”

“But you are with us.”

“Absolutely and always. But it does not include denouncing old friends.”

“But for me?”

“For you it is different.”

I knew this was true and there was nothing else to say, only I wished I had never heard of any of it.

My curiosity as to how people would act in this case had been long ago, and shamefully, satisfied. I turned to John and did not look at the table where Luis Delgado was sitting. I knew he had been flying with the fascists for over a year, and here he was, in a loyalist uniform, talking to three young loyalist flyers of the last crop that had been trained in France.

None of those new kids would know him and I wondered whether he had come to try to steal a plane or for what. Whatever he was there for, he was a fool to come to Chicote's now.

“How do you feel, John?”I asked.

“Feel good,”said John.“Is a good drink hokay. Makes me feel little bit drunk maybe. Is a good for the buzzing in the head.”

The waiter came over. He was very excited.

“I have denounced him,”he said.

“Well then,”I said,“now you haven't any problem.”

“No,”he said proudly.“I have denounced him. They are on their way now to get him.”

“Let's go,”I said to John.“There is going to be some trouble here.”

“Is best go then,”said John.“Is a plenty trouble always come, even if you do best to avoid. How much we owe?”

“You aren't going to stay?”the waiter asked.

“No.”

“But you gave me the telephone number.”

“I know it. You get to know too many telephone numbers if you stay around in this town.”

“But it was my duty.”

“Yes. Why not? Duty is a very strong thing.”

“But now?”

“Well, you felt good about it just now, didn't you? Maybe you will feel good about it again. Maybe you will get to like it.”

“You have forgotten the package,”the waiter said. He handed me the meat which was wrapped in two envelopes which had brought copies of the Spur to the piles of magazines which accumulated in one of the office rooms of the Embassy.

“I understand,”I said to the waiter.“Truly.”

“He was an old client and a good client. Also I have never denounced anyone before. I did not denounce for pleasure.”

“Also I should not speak cynically or brutally. Tell him that I denounced him. He hates me anyway by now for differences in politics. He'd feel badly if he knew it was you.”

“No. Each man must take his responsibility. But you understand?”

“Yes,”I said. Then lied.“I understand and I approve.”You have to lie very often in a war and when you have to lie you should do it quickly and as well as you can.

We shook hands and I went out the door with John. I looked back at the table where Luis Delgado sat as I went out. He had another gin and tonic in front of him and everyone at the table was laughing at something he had said. He had a very gay, brown face, and shooter's eyes, and I wondered what he was passing himself off as.

He was a fool to go to Chicote's. But that was exactly the sort of thing that he would do in order to be able to boast of it when he was back with his own people.

As we went out of the door and turned to walk up the street, a big Seguridad car drew up in front of Chicote's and eight men got out of it. Six with submachine guns took up positions outside the door. Two in plain clothes went inside. A man asked us for our papers and when I said,“Foreigners,”he said to go along; that it was all right.

In the dark going up the Gran Via there was much new broken glass on the sidewalk and much rubble under foot from the shelling. The air was still smoky and all up the street it smelled of high explosive and blasted granite.

“Where you go eat?”asked John.

“I have some meat for all of us, and we can cook it in the room.”

“I cook it,”said John.“I cook good. I remember one time when I cook on ship—”

“It will be pretty tough,”I said.“It's just been freshly butchered.”

“Oh no,”said John.“Is a no such thing as a touch meat in a war.”

People were hurrying by in the dark on their way home from the cinemas where they had stayed until the shelling was over.

“What's a matter that fascist he come to that café where they know him?”

“He was crazy to do it.”

“Is a trouble with a war,”John said.“Is a too many people crazy.”

“John,”I said,“I think you've got something there.”

Back at the hotel we went in the door past the sandbags piled to protect the porter's desk and I asked for the key, but the porter said there were two comrades upstairs in the room taking a bath. He had given them the keys.

“Go on up, John,”I said.“I want to telephone.”

I went over to the booth and called the same number I had given the waiter.

“Hello? Pepé?”

A thin-lipped voice came over the phone.“¿Qué tal Enrique?”

“Listen, Pepé, did you pick up a certain Luis Delgado at Chicote's?”

“Sí, hombre, sí. Sin novedad. Without trouble.”

“He doesn't know anything about the waiter?”

“No, hombre, no.”

“Then don't tell him. Tell him I denounced him then, will you? Nothing about the waiter.”

“Why when it will make no difference? He is a spy. He will be shot. There is no choice in the matter.”

“I know,”I said.“But it makes a difference.”

“As you want, hombre. As you want. When shall I see thee?”

“Lunch tomorrow. We have some meat.”

“And whisky before. Good, hombre, good.”

“Salud, Pepé, and thank you.”

“Salud, Enrique. It is nothing. Salud.”

It was a strange and very deadly voice and I never got used to hearing it, but as I walked up the stairs now, I felt much better.

All we old clients of Chicote's had a sort of feeling about the place. I knew that was why Luis Delgado had been such a fool as to go back there. He could have done his business some place else. But if he was in Madrid he had to go there. He had been a good client as the waiter had said and we had been friends. Certainly any small acts of kindness you can do in life are worth doing. So I was glad I had called my friend Pepé at Seguridad headquarters because Luis Delgado was an old client of Chicote's and I did not wish him to be disillusioned or bitter about the waiters there before he died.





The Faithful Bull


One time there was a bull and his name was not Ferdinand and he cared nothing for flowers. He loved to fight and he fought with all the other bulls of his own age, or any age, and he was a champion.

His horns were as solid as wood and they were as sharply pointed as the quill of a porcupine. They hurt him, at the base, when he fought and he did not care at all. His neck muscles lifted in a great lump that is called in Spanish the morillo and this morillo lifted like a hill when he was ready to fight. He was always ready to fight and his coat was black and shining and his eyes were clear.

Anything made him want to fight and he would fight with deadly seriousness exactly as some people eat or read or go to church. Each time he fought he fought to kill and the other bulls were not afraid of him because they came of good blood and were not afraid. But they had no wish to provoke him. Nor did they wish to fight him.

He was not a bully nor was he wicked, but he liked to fight as men might like to sing or to be the King or the President. He never thought at all. Fighting was his obligation and his duty and his joy.

He fought on the stony, high ground. He fought under the cork-oak trees and he fought in the good pasture by the river. He walked fifteen miles each day from the river to the high, stony ground and he would fight any bull that looked at him. Still he was never angry.

That is not really true, for he was angry inside himself. But he did not know why, because he could not think. He was very noble and he loved to fight.

So what happened to him? The man who owned him, if anyone can own such an animal, knew what a great bull he was and still he was worried because this bull cost him so much money by fighting with other bulls. Each bull was worth over one thousand dollars and after they had fought the great bull they were worth less than two hundred dollars and sometimes less than that.

So the man, who was a good man, decided that he would keep the blood of this bull in all of his stock rather than send him to the ring to be killed. So he selected him for breeding.

But this bull was a strange bull. When they first turned him into the pasture with the breeding cows, he saw one who was young and beautiful and slimmer and better muscled and shinier and more lovely than all the others. So, since he could not fight, he fell in love with her and he paid no attention to any of the others. He only wanted to be with her, and the others meant nothing to him at all.

The man who owned the bull ranch hoped that the bull would change, or learn, or be different than he was. But the bull was the same and he loved whom he loved and no one else. He only wanted to be with her, and the others meant nothing to him at all.

So the man sent him away with five other bulls to be killed in the ring, and at least the bull could fight, even though he was faithful. He fought wonderfully and everyone admired him and the man who killed him admired him the most. But the fighting jacket of the man who killed him and who is called the matador was wet through by the end, and his mouth was very dry.

“Que toro más bravo,”the matador said as he handed his sword to his sword handler. He handed it with the hilt up and the blade dripping with the blood from the heart of the brave bull who no longer had any problems of any kind and was being dragged out of the ring by four horses.

“Yes. He was the one the Marqués of Villamayor had to get rid of because he was faithful,”the sword handler, who knew everything, said.

“Perhaps we should all be faithful,”the matador said.





An African Story


He was waiting for the moon to rise and he felt Kibo's hair rise under his hand as he stroked him to be quiet and they both watched and listened as the moon came up and gave them shadows. His arm was around the dog's neck now and he could feel him shivering. All of the night sounds had stopped. They did not hear the elephant and David did not see him until the dog turned his head and seemed to settle into David. Then the elephant's shadow covered them and he moved past making no noise at all and they smelled him in the light wind that came down from the mountain. He smelled strong but old and sour and when he was past David saw that the left tusk was so long it seemed to reach the ground.

They waited but no other elephants came by and then David and the dog started off running in the moonlight. The dog kept close behind him and when David stopped the dog pressed his muzzle into the back of his knee.

David had to see the bull again and they came up on him at the edge of the forest. He was traveling toward the mountain and slowly moving into the steady night breeze. David came close enough to see him cut off the moon again and to smell the sour oldness but he could not see the right tusk. He was afraid to work closer with the dog and he took him back with the wind and pushed him down against the base of a tree and tried to make him understand. He thought the dog would stay and he did but when David moved up toward the bulk of the elephant again he felt the wet muzzle against the hollow of his knee.

The two of them followed the elephant until he came to an opening in the trees. He stood there moving his huge ears. His bulk was in the shadow but the moonlight would be on his head. David reached behind him and closed the dog's jaws gently with his hand and then moved softly and unbreathing to his right along the edge of the night breeze, feeling it on his cheek, edging with it, never letting it get between him and the bulk until he could see the elephant's head and the great ears slowly moving. The right tusk was as thick as his own thigh and it curved down almost to the ground.

He and Kibo moved back, the wind on his neck now, and they backtracked out of the forest and into the open park country. The dog was ahead of him now and he stopped where David had left the two hunting spears by the trail when they had followed the elephant. He swung them over his shoulder in their thong and leather cup harness and, with his best spear that he had kept with him all the time in his hand, they started on the trail for the shamba. The moon was high now and he wondered why there was no drumming from the shamba. Something was strange if his father was there and there was no drumming.




David had felt the tiredness as soon as they had picked up the trail again.

For a long time he had been fresher and in better shape than the two men and impatient with their slow trailing and the regular halts his father made each hour on the hour. He could have moved ahead much faster than Juma and his father but when he started to tire they were the same as ever and at noon they took only the usual five-minute rest and he had seen that Juma was increasing the pace a little. Perhaps he wasn't. Perhaps it had only seemed faster but the elephant dung was fresher now although it was not warm yet to the touch. Juma gave him the rifle to carry after they came upon the last pile of dung but after an hour he looked at him and took it back. They had been climbing steadily across a slope of the mountain but now the trail went down and from a gap in the forest he saw broken country ahead.“Here's where the tough part starts, Davey,”his father said.

It was then he knew that he should have been sent back to the shamba once he had put them on the trail. Juma had known it for a long time. His father knew it now and there was nothing to be done. It was another of his mistakes and there was nothing to do now except gamble.

David looked down at the big flattened circle of the print of the elephant's foot and saw where the bracken had been pressed down and where a broken stem of a weed was drying. Juma picked it up and looked at the sun. Juma handed the broken weed to David's father and his father rolled it in his fingers. David noticed the white flowers that were drooped and dying. But they still had not dried in the sun nor shed their petals.

“It's going to be a bitch,”his father said.“Let's get going.”

Late in the afternoon they were still tracking through the broken country. He had been sleepy now for a long time and as he watched the two men he knew that sleepiness was his real enemy and he followed their pace and tried to move through and out of the sleep that deadened him. The two men relieved each other tracking on the hour and the one who was in second place looked back at him at regular intervals to check if he was with them. When they made a dry camp at dark in the forest he went to sleep as soon as he sat down and woke with Juma holding his moccasins and feeling his bare feet for blisters. His father had spread his coat over him and was sitting by him with a piece of cold cooked meat and two biscuits. He offered him a water bottle with cold tea.

“He'll have to feed, Davey,”his father said.“Your feet are in good shape. They're as sound as Juma's. Eat this slowly and drink some tea and go to sleep again. We haven't any problems.”

“I'm sorry I was so sleepy.”

“You and Kibo hunted and traveled all last night. Why shouldn't you be sleepy? You can have a little more meat if you want it.”

“I'm not hungry.”

“Good. We're good for three days. We'll hit water again tomorrow. Plenty of creeks come off the mountain.”

“Where's he going?”

“Juma thinks he knows.”

“Isn't it bad?”

“Not too bad, Davey.”

“I'm going back to sleep,”David had said.“I don't need your coat.”

“Juma and I are all right,”his father said.“I always sleep warm you know.”

David was asleep even before his father said good night. Then he woke once with the moonlight on his face and he thought of the elephant with his great ears moving as he stood in the forest, his head hung down with the weight of the tusks. David thought then in the night that the hollow way he felt as he remembered him was from waking hungry. But it was not and he found that out in the next three days.




The next day was very bad because long before noon he knew that it was not just the need for sleep that made the difference between a boy and men. For the first three hours he was fresher than they were and he asked Juma for the .303 rifle to carry but Juma shook his head. He did not smile and he had always been David's best friend and had taught him to hunt. He offered it to me yesterday, David thought, and I'm in better shape today than I was then. He was, too, but by ten o'clock he knew the day would be as bad or worse than the day before.

It was as silly for him to think that he could trail with his father as to think he could fight with him. He knew too that it was not just that they were men. They were professional hunters and he knew now that was why Juma would not even waste a smile. They knew everything the elephant had done, pointed out the signs of it to each other without speaking, and when the tracking became difficult his father always yielded to Juma. When they stopped to fill the water bottles at a stream his father said,“Just last the day out, Davey.”Then when they were past the broken country and climbing toward the forest the tracks of the elephant turned off to the right onto an old elephant trail. He saw his father and Juma talking and when he got up to them Juma was looking back over the way they had come and then at a far distant stony island of hills in the dry country and seemed to be taking a bearing of this against the peaks of three far blue hills on the horizon.

“Juma knows where he's going now,”his father explained.“He thought he knew before but then he dropped down into this stuff.”He looked back at the country they had come through all day.“Where he's headed now is pretty good going but we'll have to climb.”

They climbed until it was dark and then made another dry camp. David killed two spur fowl with his slingshot out of a small flock that had walked across the trail just before the sunset. The birds had come into the old elephant trail to dust, walking neatly and plumply, and when the pebble broke the back of one and the bird began to jerk and toss with its wings thumping, another bird ran forward to peck at it and David pouched another pebble and pulled it back and sent it against the ribs of the second bird. As he ran forward to put his hand on it the other birds whirred off. Juma had looked back and smiled this time and David picked up the two birds, warm and plump and smoothly feathered, and knocked their heads against the handle of his hunting knife.

Now where they were camped for the night his father said,“I've never seen that type of francolin quite so high. You did very well to get a double on them.”

Juma cooked the birds spitted on a stick over the coals of a very small fire. His father drank a whiskey and water from the cup top on his flask as they lay and watched Juma cook. Afterward Juma gave them each a breast with the heart in it and ate the two necks and backs and the legs himself.

“It makes a great difference, Davey,”his father said.“We're very well off on rations now.”

“How far are we behind him?”David asked.

“We're quite close,”his father said.“It depends on whether he travels when the moon comes up. It's an hour later tonight and two hours later than when you found him.”

“Why does Juma think he knows where he's going?”

“He wounded him and killed his askari not too far from here.”

“When?”

“Five years ago, he says. That may mean anytime. When you were still a toto he says.”

“Has he been alone since then?”

“He says so. He hasn't seen him. Only heard of him.”

“How big does he say he is?”

“Close to two hundred. Bigger than anything I've ever seen. He says there's only been one greater elephant and he came from near here too.”

“I'd better get to sleep,”David said.“I hope I'll be better tomorrow.”

“You were splendid today,”his father said.“I was very proud of you. So was Juma.”

In the night when he woke after the moon was up he was sure they were not proud of him except perhaps for his dexterity in killing the two birds. He had found the elephant at night and followed him to see that he had both of his tusks and then returned to find the two men and put them on the trail. David knew they were proud of that. But once the deadly following started he was useless to them and a danger to their success just as Kibo had been to him when he had gone up close to the elephant in the night, and he knew they must each have hated themselves for not having sent him back when there was time. The tusks of the elephant weighed two hundred pounds apiece. Ever since these tusks had grown beyond their normal size the elephant had been hunted for them and now the three of them would kill him for them.

David was sure that they would kill him now because he, David, had lasted through the day and kept up after the pace had destroyed him by noon. So they probably were proud of him doing that. But he had brought nothing useful to the hunt and they would have been far better off without him. Many times during the day he had wished that he had never betrayed the elephant and in the afternoon he remembered wishing that he had never seen him. Awake in the moonlight he knew that was not true.




The next morning they were following the spoor of the elephant onan old elephant trail that was a hard-packed worn road through the forest. It looked as though elephants had traveled it ever since the lava had cooled from the mountain and the trees had first grown tall and close.

Juma was very confident and they moved fast. Both his father and Juma seemed very sure of themselves and the going on the elephant road was so easy that Juma gave him the .303 to carry as they went on through the broken light of the forest. Then they lost the trail in smoking piles of fresh dung and the flat round prints of a herd of elephants that had come onto the elephant road from the heavy forest on the left of the trail. Juma had taken the .303 from David angrily. It was afternoon before they worked up to the herd and around it, seeing the gray bulks through the trees and the movement of the big ears and the searching trunks coiling and uncoiling, hearing the crash of branches broken, the crash of trees pushed over, the rumbling in the bellies of the elephants and the slap and thud of the dung falling.

They had found the trail of the old bull finally and when it turned off onto a smaller elephant road Juma had looked at David's father and grinned showing his filed teeth and his father had nodded his head. They looked as though they had a dirty secret, just as they had looked when he had found them that night at the shamba.

It was not very long before they came on the secret. It was off to the right in the forest and the tracks of the old bull led to it. It was a skull as high as David's chest and white from the sun and the rain. There was a deep depression in the forehead and a ridge ran from between the bare white eye sockets and flared out in empty broken holes where the tusks had been chopped away.

Juma pointed out where the great elephant they were trailing had stood while he looked down at the skull and where his trunk had moved it a little way from the place it had rested on the ground and where the points of his tusks had touched the ground beside it. He showed David the single hole in the big depression in the white bone of the forehead and then the four holes close together in the bone around the earhole. He grinned at David and at his father and took a .303 solid from his pocket and fitted the nose into the hole in the bone of the forehead.

“Here is where Juma wounded the big bull,”his father said.“This was his askari. His friend, really, because he was a big bull too. He charged and Juma knocked him down and finished him in the ear.”

Juma was pointing out the scattered bones and how the big bull had walked among them. Juma and David's father were both very pleased with what they had found.

“How long do you suppose he and his friend had been together?”David asked his father.

“I haven't the faintest idea,”his father said.“Ask Juma.”

“You ask him, please.”

His father and Juma spoke together and Juma had looked at David and laughed.

“Probably four or five times your life, he says,”David's father told him.“He doesn't know or care really.”

I care, David thought. I saw him in the moonlight and he was alone but I had Kibo. Kibo has me too. The bull wasn't doing any harm and now we've tracked him to where he came to see his dead friend and now we're going to kill him. It's my fault. I betrayed him.

Now Juma had worked out the trail and motioned to his father and they started on.

My father doesn't need to kill elephants to live, David thought. Juma would not have found him if I had not seen him. He had his chance at him and all he did was wound him and kill his friend. Kibo and I found him and I never should have told them and I should have kept him secret and had him always and let them stay drunk at the beer shamba. Juma was so drunk we could not wake him. I'm going to keep everything a secret always. I'll never tell them anything again. If they kill him Juma will drink his share of the ivory or just buy himself another goddamn wife. Why didn't you help the elephant when you could? All you had to do was not go on the second day. No, that wouldn't have stopped them. Juma would have gone on. You never should have told them. Never, never tell them. Try and remember that. Never tell anyone anything ever. Never tell anyone anything again.

His father waited for him to come up and said very gently,“He rested here. He's not traveling as he was. We'll be up on him anytime now.”

“Fuck elephant hunting,”David had said very quietly.

“What's that?”his father asked.

“Fuck elephant hunting,”David said softly.

“Be careful you don't fuck it up,”his father had said to him and looked at him flatly.

That's one thing, David had thought. He's not stupid. He knows all about it now and he will never trust me again. That's good. I don't want him to because I'll never ever tell him or anybody anything again, never anything again. Never ever never.




In the morning he was on the far slope of the mountain again. The elephant was no longer traveling as he had been but was moving aimlessly now, feeding occasionally and David had known they were getting close to him.

He tried to remember how he had felt. He had no love for the elephant yet. He must remember that. He had only a sorrow that had come from his own tiredness that had brought an understanding of age. Through being too young, he had learned how it must be to be too old.

He was lonesome for Kibo and thinking of how Juma killing the elephant's friend had turned him against Juma and made the elephant his brother. He knew then how much it meant to him to have seen the elephant in the moonlight and to have followed him and come close to him in the clearing so that he had seen the great tusks. But he did not know that nothing would ever be as good as that again. Now he knew they would kill the elephant and there was nothing he could do about it. He had betrayed the elephant when he had gone back to tell them at the shamba. They would kill me and they would kill Kibo if we had ivory, he had thought, and known it was untrue.

Probably the elephant is going to find where he was born and they'll kill him there. That's all they'd need to make it perfect. They'd like to have killed him where they killed his friend. That would be a big joke. That would have pleased them. The goddamned friend killers.

They had moved to the edge of thick cover now and the elephant was close ahead. David could smell him and they could all hear him pulling down branches and the snapping that they made. His father put his hand on David's shoulder to move him back and have him wait outside and then he took a big pinch of ashes from the pouch in his pocket and tossed it in the air. The ash barely slanted toward them as it fell and his father nodded at Juma and bent down to follow him into the thick cover. David watched their backs and their asses go in and out of sight. He could not hear them move.

David had stood still and listened to the elephant feeding. He could smell him as strongly as he had the night in the moonlight when he had worked up close to him and had seen his wonderful tusks. Then as he stood there it was silent and he could not smell the elephant. Then there had been a high squealing and smashing and a shot by the .303, then the heavy rocking double report of his father's .450, then the smashing and crashing had gone on going steadily away and he had gone into the heavy growth and found Juma shaken and bleeding from his forehead all down over his face and his father white and angry.

“He went for Juma and knocked him over,”his father had said.“Juma hit him in the head.”

“Where did you hit him?”

“Where I fucking well could,”his father had said.“Get on the blood spoor.”

There was plenty of blood. One stream as high as David's head that had squirted bright on trunks and leaves and vines and another much lower that was dark and foul with stomach content.

“Lung and gut shot,”his father said.“We'll find him down or anchored—I hope the hell,”he added.

They found him anchored, in such suffering and despair that he could no longer move. He had crashed through the heavy cover where he had been feeding and crossed a path of open forest and David and his father ran along the heavily splashed blood trail. Then the elephant had gone on into thick forest and David had seen him ahead standing gray and huge against the trunk of a tree. David could only see his stern and then his father moved ahead and he followed and they came alongside the elephant as though he was a ship and David saw the blood coming from his flanks and running down his sides and then his father raised his rifle and fired and the elephant turned his head with the great tusks moving heavy and slow and looked at them and when his father fired the second barrel the elephant seemed to sway like a felled tree and came smashing down toward them. But he was not dead. He had been anchored and now he was down with his shoulder broken. He did not move but his eye was alive and looked at David. He had very long eyelashes and his eye was the most alive thing David had ever seen.

“Shoot him in the earhole with the three oh three,”his father said.“Go on.”

“You shoot him,”David had said.

Juma had come up limping and bloody, the skin of his forehead hanging down over his left eye, the bone of his nose showing and one ear torn and had taken the rifle from David without speaking and pushed the muzzle almost into the earhole and fired twice, jerking the bolt and driving it forward angrily. The eye of the elephant had opened wide on the first shot and then started to glaze and blood came out of the ear and ran in two bright streams down the wrinkled gray hide. It was different colored blood and David had thought I must remember that and he had but it had never been of any use to him. Now all the dignity and majesty and all the beauty were gone from the elephant and he was a huge wrinkled pile.

“Well, we got him, Davey, thanks to you,”his father had said.“Now we'd better get a fire going so I can put Juma back together again. Come here, you bloody Humpty Dumpty. Those tusks will keep.”

Juma had come to him grinning, bringing the tail of the elephant that had no hairs on it at all. They had made a dirty joke and then his father had begun to speak rapidly in Swahili. How far to water? How far will you have to go to get people to get those tusks out of here? How are you, you worthless old pig fucker? What have you broken?

With the answers known his father had said,“You and I will go back to get the packs where we dropped them. Juma can get wood and have the fire ready. The medical kit is in my pack. We have to get the packs before it's dark. He won't infect. It's not like claw wounds. Let's go.”




That evening as David had sat by the fire he had looked at Juma with his stitched-up face and his broken ribs and wondered if the elephant had recognized him when he had tried to kill him. He hoped he had. The elephant was his hero now as his father had been for a long time and he had thought, I didn't believe he could do it when he was so old and tired. He would have killed Juma, too. But he didn't look at me as though he wanted to kill me. He only looked sad the same way I felt. He visited his old friend on the day he died.

David remembered how the elephant lost all dignity as soon as his eye had ceased to be alive and how when his father and he had returned with the packs the elephant had already started to swell, even in the cool evening. There was no more true elephant; only the gray wrinkled swelling dead body and the huge mottled brown and yellow tusks that they had killed him for. The tusks were stained with dried blood and he scraped some off with his thumbnail like a dried piece of sealing wax and put it in the pocket of his shirt. That was all he took from the elephant except the beginning of the knowledge of loneliness.

After the butchery his father tried to talk to him that night by the fire.

“He was a murderer you know, Davey,”he had said.“Juma says nobody knows how many people he has killed.”

“They were all trying to kill him, weren't they?”

“Naturally,”his father had said,“with that pair of tusks.”

“How could he be a murderer then?”

“Just as you like,”his father had said.“I'm sorry you got so mixed up about him.”

“I wish he'd killed Juma,”David said.

“I think that's carrying it a little far,”his father said.“Juma's your friend, you know.”

“Not any more.”

“No need to tell him so.”

“He knows it,”David had said.

“I think you misjudge him,”his father said and they had left it there.

Then when they were finally back safely with the tusks after all the things that had happened and the tusks were propped against the wall of the stick and mud house, leaning there with their points touching, the tusks so tall and thick that no one could believe them even when they touched them and no one, not even his father, could reach to the top of the bend where they curved in for the points to meet, there when Juma and his father and he were heroes and Kibo was a hero's dog and the men who had carried the tusks were heroes, already slightly drunk heroes and to be drunker, his father had said,“Do you want to make peace, Davey?”

“All right,”he said because he knew this was the start of the never telling that he had decided on.

“I'm so glad,”his father said.“It's so much simpler and better.”

Then they sat on old men's stools under the shade of the fig tree with the tusks against the wall of the hut and drank beer from gourd cups that were brought by a young girl and her younger brother, the servant of heroes, sitting in the dust by the heroic dog of a hero who held an old cockerel, newly promoted to the standing of the heroes' favorite rooster. They sat there and drank beer while the big drum started and the ngoma began to build.
