美国最伟大的小说——《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》





“谁能比奥德修斯更像希腊人？比浮士德更像德国人？比堂·吉诃德更像西班牙人？比哈克贝利·费恩更像美国人？”

诺贝尔文学奖得主

英美文学大师

T. S．艾略特





“现代美国文学，全都来源于马克·吐温写的一本书，书名叫作《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》……它是我们所有的书中最好的一本书。[1]在这以前没有过，打它以后也没有这么好。”





诺贝尔文学奖得主

著名美国小说家

海明威





在美国文学史上，能荣膺世界大师级文化巨人的头衔，当然首推塞缪尔·兰霍恩·克莱门斯（1835—1910）。他的笔名马克·吐温，原意“两英寻深”，是密西西比河上专测水深的员工的术语，也意味着他的整个一生跟密西西比河紧密地联系在一起。1996年问世的美国牛津版《马克·吐温全集》（共二十九卷）主编，得克萨斯大学英文教授雪莉·费·费什金撰文指出，马克·吐温曾被誉为“美国的塞万提斯”“美国的荷马”“美国的托尔斯泰”“美国的莎士比亚”“美国的拉伯雷”。[2]1933年罗斯福总统的“新政”一词，就是从马克·吐温小说《亚瑟王朝廷上的美国佬》一书中移用过来的。[3]马克·吐温另一部长篇小说书名《镀金时代》[4]，已给整整一个时代命了名定了性。马克·吐温率先将民间幽默与严肃文学融为一体，使草根百姓、俚俗细民成为文学中的主人公，还让方言土话甚至俚语行话登上了艺术殿堂。马克·吐温开创了富有浓郁特色的美国本土气息的一代文学新风，因建功奇伟而独步文坛，誉满全球。当时美国文坛主将豪威尔斯[5]曾称他为“我们文学中的林肯”。著名评论家门肯[6]尊奉他是“我们民族文学的真正始祖”。英美现代文学大师、诺贝尔文学奖得主T.S．艾略特[7]说，《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》在英美两国开创了新文风，是英语的新发现。哈克的形象是永恒的，堪与奥德赛、浮士德、堂·吉诃德、堂·璜，以及哈姆雷特等举世驰名的文学典型相媲美。他甚至还说，《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》一书指控蓄奴制度，要远比《汤姆叔叔的小屋》[8]更加令人信服。当时美国小说似乎还没有得到英国文学界认同。但是，英国大文豪萧伯纳[9]给马克·吐温的信中却这样写道：“未来的美国历史学家会认为你的作品对他必不可缺，就如同法国历史学家认为伏尔泰的政论文对他必不可缺一样。”后来，欧洲人对马克·吐温的评价之高，甚至超过了他本国的人，他们认为，马克·吐温是一位伟大的思想家。





马克·吐温的生平与创作，对我国读者来说恐怕不算太陌生。可是，马克·吐温在美国与世界上无远弗届的影响，也许鲜为人知。因此，本人不揣冒昧，在此稍作介绍。

当今美国，在密苏里州圣路易斯有一家马克·吐温银行，纽约杰克逊高地有一家马克·吐温小餐厅，佛罗里达州莱克兰有一家马克·吐温烟铺。在西雅图等四个城市，各有一所马克·吐温小学。在康涅狄格州首府哈特福德市有一家马克·吐温书店。马克·吐温的慈祥形象，居然还出现在田纳西州某煤气公司、首都华盛顿某家旅馆、加利福尼亚州某座公墓，乃至于销售巴斯名酒（作家最爱喝苏格兰威士忌酒）的偌大广告牌上。

马克·吐温的崇高声望和音容笑貌，尽管是无处不在，无处不有，但是，他断断乎不会成为僵化了的偶像。恰好相反，马克·吐温至今依然活在人间。《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》一书，在当今美国，“从初中起一直到攻读硕士、博士学位的各高等学府里，乃是教得最多的一部小说，教得最多的一部长篇小说，教得最多的一部美国文学作品”。有的图书出版公司将小说《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》及其有关评论、背景材料辑成汇编本，赠给各大学教授作为教学参考书籍。好几个马克·吐温扮演者，频频出现在美国各地影剧院、新片试映室与购物中心。我在美国各地书店亲眼看到，单是《马克·吐温全集》，就有三套（牛津版、兰登版、加州大学版）同时陈列在书架上，这在美国作家中间恐怕也是绝无仅有。马克·吐温的作品早已走向世界，在那不勒斯、利雅得、贝尔法斯特[10]和北京等地学校课堂上，都被指定为学生阅读作业内容；而且，自20世纪以来，从阿根廷到尼日利亚到日本，地域几乎遍及全球的作家群，也一直受到马克·吐温的积极影响。时至今日信息化时代，马克·吐温又成为网络上人们日常交谈的时髦主题。世界各地传媒记者，几乎每天都觉得理所当然地要从马克·吐温的经典作品中援引一些名言隽语。美国不少电视连续剧（比方说，《星际旅行：下一代》[11]等）里，还常常让马克·吐温担纲出任主演。好莱坞剧作家也都要从他的作品里汲取滋养与灵感，不时推出一些影片来。甚至许多撰写神秘小说与科幻小说的作者，还会不断地把马克·吐温编进他们的故事情节中去。挺有意思的是，哈克还有幸成为影视屏幕上的一颗明星。至少有六位美国电影导演，曾经请哈克登上银幕，同时，俄文版的哈克影片也有四部之多。我在美国各城镇公共图书馆以及各音带出租公司，就看见过各种不同版本的录像带，相当走俏。好几套电视节目曾将《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》向全球观众播映。耐人寻味的是，在1955年一档节目里头不知怎的将吉姆这个关键性人物完全抹掉了。另外，还有不知凡几的连环漫画册，一部片名为《马克·吐温历险记》的动画片，这全说明《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》这部故事在美国早已家喻户晓，尽人皆知。一百多年以来，哈克和他的小说，早已根深蒂固地进入了美国人的民族意识中去。几乎可以这么说，每个美国人的血脉里或多或少地会带有哈克的基因。

不论在20世纪还是21世纪，人们对《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》都情有独钟。有的美国评论家甚至还这样预言说：只要我们这个星球上依然存在着贫困、仇恨、种族主义、溺爱儿童、兽行、暴力、伪善、压迫、苦工，以及还有奴役——不言而喻，人们还得一遍又一遍地仔细捧读《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》。





马克·吐温写《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》，是正当他创作旺盛的年代，即在1876年—1883年，[12]在这期间，他写过两部重要作品《海外浪迹》与《王子与贫儿》，将《密西西比河上的往事》扩充成为《密西西比河上》，同时还把一些短篇作品收入了三个集子。不过，那个时期他创作的重点，乃是酝酿已久的另一部小说，当时书名是《汤姆·索亚的伙伴》，场景：密西西比河谷。时间：19世纪40至50年代以前。作者打算利用自己在《密西西比河上的往事》和《汤姆·索亚历险记》里写过有关汉尼拔和密西西比河的素材，在后来定名为《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》一书中得到充分展开，最后达到登峰造极的顶巅。

马克·吐温写《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》，真可以说是独辟蹊径，博采众长。他将先前幽默作家在他们的短小趣闻轶事中包含的真知灼见兼容并蓄，纳入一个规模较大的框架里去。后来，他的这一写作设想果然卓有成效，不消说，这是跟他从题材中不断开挖、不断发现新含义分不开的。他那丰富的想象力经常使他的创作才智熠熠生辉，而方法上的不断创新，反过来又给他的想象开拓了新的视野；这种相辅相成、相得益彰的辩证关系，在其他作家的成长过程中也屡见不鲜。

这种辩证的过程，在《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》的构思中，也是特别令人瞩目的。他在先前一些作品里经常表露出自己的立场观点，不消说，极其显眼；此次写作手法上有了创新，让哈克采用了第一人称来叙事状物，作者自然用不着直接闯入故事叙述中去，所以，原先他写作上的这一不足之处，也就不复存在。可是，故事一转到以哈克为主的时候，运用民间俗语进行文学创作，明摆着具有很大的潜力，特别是运用方言也可以表达严肃的主旨，而且还可以让运用方言的叙述者从区区第一人称转变为一个深悟人性的典型，凡此等等都是作者所始料不及的。显然，这也是小说创作上一场严峻的挑战。由于马克·吐温出色地回应了挑战，结果使《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》成为他所写的书里头最伟大的一部书，同时又是美国文学中仅有的两三部得到公认的杰作之一。不过，毋庸讳言，这一惊人的成就随之也产生了他写作上一个尚待解决的新问题：原来马克·吐温这部小说是以带有喜剧色彩的故事启端，随后按照故事情节逐渐发展，渐渐开始具有跟喜剧前提相悖的悲剧含意。

《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》一书，从内容上说，包含着三个组成部分。其中，哈克与吉姆冒险出逃、向往自由的故事，不消说，最惹人瞩目。吉姆拼死要逃离的是当时的奴隶生涯。哈克竭力逃避的乃是他醉鬼父亲的暴虐，沃森老小姐和道格拉斯寡妇善意的、所谓文明的管教，以及当时美国社会习俗上数见不鲜的繁文缛节和清规戒律。马克·吐温把他的热情和他最熟悉的生活底蕴，少年时代河上小镇和那条河上的生涯，全部倾注在小说的篇章中。狄更斯在他的《旅美见闻记》中认为密西西比河是一条“流着泥浆”的浊流，“除了每天夜里有无害的闪电向漆黑的天空闪耀以外，没有一点儿愉快的东西”。可是，对马克·吐温来说，不论在他的童年还是在他的回忆里，密西西比河不啻是整个生命。在他那生花的妙笔底下，密西西比河已被写成人生旅程的象征。小说中第二个组成部分，内容特别丰赡，是作者亦庄亦谐地针对密西西比河沿岸各城镇所做出的社会讽刺。这种讽刺一方面令人忍俊不禁，特别是描述泼皮痞子“国王”和“公爵”的那些插曲，一方面也揭露了令人发指的暴行，比方说，格兰杰福特与谢泼德逊两家为了世代族仇互相厮杀，以及舍伯恩上校残杀孤苦伶仃的老好人博格斯。小说最末组成部分，是着重塑造哈克这个人物性格逐渐丰满、臻于完美的过程。有的评论家指出，《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》，除了小说结尾处汤姆·索亚式的营救吉姆那一段以外，都是十全十美的，堪称一幅令人难忘的美国边疆少年的图画[13]。在当时充满暴力、伪善、冷酷、贫困的现实社会里，哈克贝利因敢于叛逆，倒是不失为自由的，外部环境想要把他“管教”成一个文明人，可他到头来仍然是一个没有让外部环境扭曲、让外部环境败坏的淳朴的人。马克·吐温对哈克的描写，清新、活泼、逼真，好似神来之笔，特别是有一些经典段落，读起来令人回肠荡气，真可以说是这部小说中的华彩乐章。

以上这三个基本组成部分，马克·吐温一开始动笔，想必就时时刻刻浮现在他脑际，因为正如美国评论家所说，这部小说的伟大，主要就在于它的连贯性，各个组成部分之间有着错综复杂的相互联系。不过，多年来美国评论家对这部小说进行潜心研究——沃尔特·布莱尔教授甚至还给它制订出创作年表——都已表明：马克·吐温为了探索一种结构，能够落实自己对主题和人物的构想，确实经历过好几个阶段，而不是一蹴而就。他刚开始写作的时候，虽然未必清晰地意识到自己的笔触究竟会指点到哪里，但是我们读者似乎一目了然地看到作者无论在创作意图上还是手法上，始终处在不断有新发现、新创意、新亮点的过程之中。

小说从开头这几章历险纪事，渐次转入中间那些长篇大段的社会讽刺章节时，促使故事情节得以全面深入地展开，并由此发展到第三十一章著名道德危机中对哈克这个人物最后做出的心理透析。不言而喻，这种道德危机是由哈克惊悉自己拯救吉姆归于失败而引起，因此也就标志着探索自由的真正结局。至于发生在费尔普斯种植园里令人困惑的最后插曲，建议读者最好不妨把它看成是马克·吐温要把刚刚露头的悲剧复归到故事原先规定好以喜剧告终而不得不采用的一种花招罢了。

《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》1884年在英国伦敦查托·温多斯图书出版公司问世后，颇受英国与欧洲大陆读者欢迎，但在美国反而遭到社会舆论的严厉谴责，说它“纯属垃圾”“极端粗俚”“不堪卒读”，甚至被麻省康科德公共图书馆列为禁书。尽管这样，翌年《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》在美国再版以后，在文学界却好评如潮。T.S．艾略特就赞不绝口地说：“《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》是马克·吐温许多书里头唯一称得上杰作的一部书。”“马克·吐温写了一部远比他自己所能感悟到的更为伟大的书。”T.S．艾略特在肯定马克·吐温所塑造的哈克这个不朽的美国人典型时，一迭连声赞美道：“谁能比奥德修斯更像希腊人？比浮士德更像德国人？比堂·吉诃德更像西班牙人？比哈克贝利·费恩更像美国人？”另一位美国著名诗人奥登（1907—1973）则一锤定音地说：“《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》乃是了解美国的一把钥匙。”迄今一百多年以来，《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》始终以它永恒的艺术魅力，吸引着全世界数以亿计的不同年龄和不同知识层次的读者，迟至1982年还被《纽约时报》誉为“最伟大的小说之一”。十多年前，沃尔特·布莱尔教授根据一项精确的统计资料，估算出已印造的《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》总册数在十亿以上，不消说，远远地超过任何其他美国文学作品。特别是近五十年来，美国文学评论界曾就哈克与吉姆河上漂流的象征意义，密西西比河与岸的象征，小说最后结尾的成败得失，乃至于莫非哈克是个黑孩子诸问题，一直进行探讨，迄今还是见仁见智，争论不休；据说每年还要推出好几百篇颇有分量的论著。不久前，我在哈佛大学最大的卫登纳图书馆[14]书库里，见到所收藏的马克·吐温各种版本原著以及有关长篇评论书籍，竟然多达六百余种；在康涅狄格州首府哈特福德市美国国家级历史文化名胜古迹“马克·吐温故居”及其珍本收藏处，毗邻的三一学院沃金森图书馆里，同样是汗牛充栋，简直令人望“书”兴叹。显而易见，在美国，围绕着马克·吐温小说，从学术界、文学出版界、影视娱乐圈，乃至于寻常百姓家里，似乎掀起了一股久兴未艾的“哈克热”。

作为译者来说，总的感受是，马克·吐温在小说《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》里笔触所指，已涉及南北战争以后美国现实、社会、种族、宗教、风俗、历史、传统、女权的各个方面，简直可以说包罗万象，涵盖了一切，所以说它是始于19世纪中叶、一直延续至今的美国社会生活的百科全书，我认为也不算太过分。难怪我不止一次地阅读它，理解它，感悟它，还是感到很吃力。动笔开译前看过不少有关评论著述，译时大大小小译注总共做了一百七八十条，反正在我迄至今日译过的八大部美国文学长篇名著中，就数它注释上花的功夫最大。即使这样，拙文仍不敢对小说妄加置评。相信我国读者阅后自有真知灼见。

要说我跟《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》这部小说，似乎也有那么一点“书缘”，前前后后长达半个多世纪之久。

记得我是在国立浙江大学慈湖畔大学图书馆[15]里才头一次读到《西风之神》[16]丛书版《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》这部传奇小说，当时手边还在翻看的，碰巧又是塞万提斯的英文版《堂·吉诃德》（不过，恕我直言，我只读了它的前半部，底下就没耐心读下去了）。当然，那时我并不知道美国评论家盛赞《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》一书，曾将马克·吐温与塞万提斯相提并论；同时又指出，先是汤姆与哈克（在《汤姆·索亚历险记》一书中），后来在《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》中，汤姆一角淡出，哈克易位，变成了主人公，于是，哈克与吉姆这一对搭档，竟跟吉诃德与桑丘·潘扎那一对主仆人物有颇多相似之处。当然，我更不知道门肯赞美小说时这样说过：“我相信《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》是世界上伟大的杰作之一，完全可跟《堂·吉诃德》媲美……而且远远地胜过勒萨日的《吉尔·布拉斯》[17]……（马克·吐温）就是属于一切时代的伟大艺术家里头的一个。”门肯在这里说马克·吐温乃是“属于一切时代”的艺术大师，这一文坛典故源自17、18世纪英国大作家本·琼森对莎士比亚的最高评价[18]，自此以后传为美谈，几百年来一直被认作衡量一位艺术家的几乎不可企及的圭臬。当时读后将我深深地吸引住的是小说跌宕起伏的情节，引人入胜的故事，鞭辟入里的讽刺，还有小说中对瞬息万变的大自然景象的生动描绘（诸如江河岛岬、日月星辰、风雨云雾等等），无不充满了诗情画意，令人叹为观止；于是，自然而然，我就萌生了译的念头，借以填补一下美国文学在我国的空白[19]。无奈新中国成立初期，当务之急断乎不是译介美国文学，二十多个寒暑端的是弹指一挥间。迨至改革开放的80年代初，我才如愿以偿，连续译出了一些美国文学长篇名著，其中包括本人情有独钟的《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》。我特别感谢老友、诗人、资深翻译家吴钧陶先生，由于他竭诚邀约与高情雅意，拙译《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》有幸列入《马克·吐温十九卷集》第十卷（吴钧陶主编．河北教育出版社，精装本．2002年版），颇受专家、读者厚爱。





英国著名作家弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫说过：“到一个外国的文学领域中去漫游，跟我们到国外去旅游极其相似。”[20]说来也真凑巧，1995年夏至1997年春，我偕同夫人张许访问美国期间，也许是置身于异域文化氛围之中，耳濡目染，似乎平添了几许真实感受，跟书中主人公好像更容易引起共鸣；夫人有时不觉技痒，就不声不响，断断续续译过一些片断，聊以自娱。没承望“无心插柳柳成荫”，眼前这个译本倒成了庆贺她今岁六秩生日的礼物，又算是圆了我半个世纪前的“梦”，哪怕是拙译也许还远没有尽善尽美地传达出地地道道属于塞缪尔·克莱门斯所独有的韵味。





最后值得一提的是，2006年以来，英、美、澳文学界出版界及著名媒体《泰晤士报》《纽约时报》《读者文摘》，通过不同方式评选出最受作家、文学家与广大读者喜爱的“世界十大文学名著”，美国仅有一本入选，即《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》，理由是这本书是“美国最伟大的小说”。

说明


这部书里使用了好几种方言：密苏里州的黑人方言；西南部边远地区极端俚俗的方言；“派克郡”的普通方言；还有最末这一种方言的四个变种。这些方言色彩上有细微差别，不是偶尔随意，或凭猜测揣度造成的，而是煞费苦心，以作者个人熟悉这几种专门语言作为可信的指靠所致。

我之所以作出这一说明，是出于以下原因：要是不作说明，许多读者就会以为这些人物想要说同样的话，而又说不好似的。





马克·吐温





第一章


你要是没看过《汤姆·索亚历险记》那本书，就不知道我[1]是什么人；不过，那也不要紧。那本书是马克·吐温先生作的，他说的基本上都是真事。也有些事是他胡扯的，不过基本上他说的还是真事。可那也没关系。我从来没见过不会胡扯的人，谁都备不住胡扯过一两回的；不过也有例外，那就是波莉阿姨和那位寡妇，也许还有玛丽。波莉阿姨——她是汤姆的波莉姨妈——和玛丽，还有道格拉斯寡妇，在那本书里都谈到过了——那本书十之八九都是真实的；不过，正如我刚才所说的，有些地方是胡扯的。

那本书是这样结尾的：汤姆和我把盗贼藏在洞里的钱财踅摸到了，我们就富起来了。我们各得六千块钱——全是金币。看着那么多的钱堆在一起，真够吓人的。哦，撒切尔法官就拿这笔钱去放利，因此我们一年到头、每人每天可得利一美元，简直不知怎么办才好。道格拉斯寡妇收养我做她的儿子，说要管教管教我；可是整天价憋在家里真难受，瞧那个寡妇的举止谈吐那么正经古板，简直让人腻味！所以说，到了我再也受不了的时候，我就跑了出来。我又穿上自己从前的破衣烂衫，一钻进那个特大圆桶，就觉得很自在，很知足了。哪知道汤姆·索亚把我踅摸到了，他说他打算搞一个强盗帮；他说我只要先回到寡妇那里，做一个正派人，也可以入伙的。于是，我又回去了。

寡妇为我感到伤心，管我叫作可怜的迷途羔羊[2]，还有许许多多别的绰号，可她从未想要伤害我。她又给我穿上新衣服，可我真没辙，只好一个劲儿直出汗，浑身上下难受死了。接下去那老一套又来了。寡妇一摇吃饭铃，你就得准时到。可你到了餐桌跟前，不能马上就吃。你得先等寡妇低下头去，冲着饭菜嘀咕几句，虽然饭菜并没有什么问题——这就是说，一点儿问题都没有，只不过每道菜都是分开做的。要是一桶残羹剩饭，那就大不相同了：那玩意儿是连汤带水掺和在一块儿，味儿更美。

晚饭以后，她搬出她的书来，给我讲摩西和纸莎草的故事[3]；我急巴巴要把摩西的身世闹个明白。但过了好久，她才说到摩西老早就死了，那时我就再也不管他摩西不摩西了，因为我压根儿不看重死人的。

当时，我马上想要抽口烟，要求寡妇宽容我一回，可她就是不肯。她说那是陋俗，而且不干净，关照我切莫再抽了。有些人的德行正是这样，他们对某一件事还不了解时就对它产生了恶感。你看，她开口闭口离不了摩西，摩西跟她既不是沾亲带故，况且又是一个老早就死了的人，对谁都没有什么好处，可是我要做一件多少有些好处的事，她却一个劲儿跟我找茬儿。再说嘛，她自己也在吸鼻烟；当然咯，那就没事了，因为那是她自己在吸呢。

她的妹妹沃森小姐，是个瘦骨嶙峋的老处女，戴着一副眼镜，不久前才过来跟姐姐住在一块儿。她满怀恶意地拿了一本拼音书来给我难堪。她硬是让我苦熬了约莫个把钟头，随后那寡妇才关照她手下留情一点儿。可我再也忍受不了。接下来又是个把钟头，真是闷得要死，那时我已是坐立不安了。沃森小姐总是唠叨说：“两脚不要在那上头跷起，哈克贝利。”还有“不准那样缩头缩脑，哈克贝利——要挺起腰板坐直。”过了半晌，她又唠叨说：“别那么打呵欠、伸懒腰，哈克贝利——你干吗不想规矩点儿？”那时，她就给我大讲特讲地狱里的事，我说我可真的巴不得上那儿去。这话可把她气坏了，其实我这么说并无任何恶意。我一心一意只想上别处去；不外乎换一换环境，到哪儿我都不挑剔的。她说我刚才说的是缺德话。她说那种话她是无论如何都说不出口的。她说她是要好好地过日子，赶明儿才能进入天堂。得了，反正我可看不出跟她一块儿去那个地方会有什么好处，所以我就下决心压根儿不想那种事。但我从来没有那么说过，因为一说出来只会添麻烦，一点儿好处都没有。

她既然开了头，就没完没了地唠叨下去，把天堂里的事对我全都说了。她说，在那里一个人整天价只要走来走去，弹弹竖琴，唱唱歌儿（而且永远都是这个样）就可以了。所以，我觉得那可没有什么了不起。但我从来都不那么说的。我就开口问道，依她看来，汤姆·索亚上那儿去行不行，她回答说看来他还不行。我一听这话可真高兴，因为我巴不得他老是跟我在一块儿。

沃森小姐老是找我的茬儿，真是讨厌、无聊。多亏她们把那些黑人先是叫进来做祷告，随后各自回转去睡觉了。我拿着一支蜡烛，到了楼上自己的卧室里，把蜡烛搁在桌子上。然后，我坐在窗边一张椅子上，一个劲儿在想什么开心事儿，可总是白搭。我觉得挺孤单，恨不得自己死了才好[4]。天上的星星闪闪发亮，树林子里的叶子沙沙发响，听起来总是那么凄凄惨惨；我听见远处一只猫头鹰在鸣叫，莫不是有人死了；还有一只夜莺和一头野狗在那里乱嚷嚷，想必是有人快要咽气了。微风想要跟我喃喃细语，可我听不清它在诉说些什么，反而使我冷得浑身直哆嗦。随后，在那树林子的远处，我听见一阵鬼叫的声音，那个鬼想要把自己心中的块垒尽情倾吐出来，可又不能表达得清清楚楚，所以就没法安安静静地躺在墓穴里，每到夜晚只好到处哭号游荡。我心里感到既沮丧又惊恐，巴不得有个把人来跟我做伴。没多久，一只蜘蛛突然爬上我的肩膀，我赶紧用手指轻轻地一弹，它就掉在蜡烛上头了。我还来不及挪动一下，它早已烧成了灰。不消说，我早知道那是个天大的凶兆，备不住我还会倒霉，所以我心里吓得要命，衣服差点儿都抖落到地上。我站起身来，在原地转了三圈，每转一圈就在自己的胸前画一个十字。然后，我用一根线把自己的头发束成一小绺，以便驱妖避邪。不过我心里并没有多大把握。你要是踅摸到一块马蹄铁，没有把它钉到门楣上，反而弄丢了，那你不妨这么做，照样会逢凶化吉。但是，你想用掐死一只蜘蛛的办法来躲避厄运，我可从来没听说过。

我又坐了下来，浑身上下直发颤。我就掏出烟斗来，抽了口烟，此时此刻屋子里早已死寂一片，所以寡妇绝不会知道的。歇了好半天，我听见小镇上的大钟，在远处当——当——当——敲了十二响——随后又是一片寂静——比刚才还要寂静。不一会儿，我听见黑乎乎的树林子里，有一根树桠枝被折断了的声音——想必是惊动了什么东西。我一声不响地坐在那里听着。我马上隐隐约约听见那边发出一声：“咪呜！咪呜！”那可敢情好呀！我也尽可能轻轻地发出一声：“咪呜！咪呜！”随后，我吹灭蜡烛，从窗口一下子爬到棚屋顶上，再滑落到地面上，匍匐爬进树林子里去。一点儿没错，汤姆·索亚在那儿等着我哩。

[3]《圣经》中说埃及新王虐待以色列人，下令把以色列人所生的男孩都要扔到河里淹死。后来国王的女儿发现了还是婴儿的摩西，当时后者躺在一只用纸莎草编织的篮筐里，在尼罗河中漂流，于是就收养了他。日后，摩西就领以色列人逃出埃及。故事详见《圣经·旧约全书·出埃及记》。道格拉斯寡妇已把哈克收养为儿子，打算把自己跟古埃及国王的女儿相比，可是这段故事当时哈克压根儿没听懂，却把纸莎草篮筐说成了“纸莎草帮”。

[4]马克·吐温在密苏里州汉尼拔镇的童年生涯，几乎如同哈克一样常碰到暴行，所以，他在小说里描绘童年世界既是田园牧歌式，又是噩梦一场。综观全书，哈克心心念念常会想到死，此处乃是他头一次暗示。





第二章


我们沿着树林子里的小路，蹑手蹑脚地朝寡妇的花园尽头走过去。我们还弯着腰走，唯恐树桠枝刮破头皮。我们走过厨房时，我被树根绊了一跤，发出扑通一声响。我们马上蹲了下来，一动也不动。沃森小姐的大个儿黑奴吉姆，正端坐在厨房门口，因为他背后有灯光，所以我们看得一清二楚。他霍地站起来，伸长脖子，听了一会儿，就说：

“是谁在那儿？”

吉姆又听了一会儿，就踮起脚尖走过来，恰巧站在我们俩的当中，我们一伸手，几乎就要碰着他。大约过了好一阵子，一点儿声响都听不见，我们三个人差不离紧紧地挨挤在一块儿。这时候，我的脚踝上某个部位痒起来了，可我就是不敢搔痒。随后，我的耳朵又开始发痒，接下来发痒的，正好在我两肩之间的后背上。我仿佛觉得不搔一下痒就会痒死似的。打从那时起，我对这类事不知多少回都很经心在意。你要是跟贵族在一起，或者是在某某人家的葬礼上，或者是在毫不困倦的时候硬要入睡——不管怎么说，你只要来到不该搔痒的地方，就会觉得浑身上下有成百上千个部位都痒得要死。过了半晌，吉姆又说：

“说呀——你是谁？你是干什么的？我要是没听见什么声响，真该死。得了，我知道该怎么办的。我就一直坐在这儿，反正会再听见那声响的。”

于是，他就坐在我和汤姆当中的地上。他背靠着大树，两腿向外伸开去，他的一条腿差点儿碰着我的腿。冷不防我的鼻子开始发痒，痒得我都要流眼泪了。可我还是不敢搔痒。随后，肚子里头也开始发痒。接下来屁股底下也痒了。我真不知道该怎样坐着才能纹丝不动。我受这种罪虽然只有六七分钟，但是自己觉得好像还要长得多似的。此时此刻，我全身有十一个不同部位都在发痒。我估摸自己连一分钟也忍受不了，可我还是咬紧牙关，准备再挺下去。正好这时候，吉姆的呼吸开始变得沉重起来，接着就打起呼噜来了——于是，我身上一下子又觉得舒服了。

汤姆给了我一个暗号——从嘴里轻轻地嘘了一声——于是我们就开始匍匐爬行了。我们才离开十英尺时，汤姆就向我低声耳语地说，他真想开开玩笑，把吉姆拴在树上。可是我说不行。说不定吉姆醒了，一闹腾起来，那时她们就会发现我不在屋子里。接着，汤姆却说他手里的蜡烛还短缺，不妨溜到厨房去再踅摸几支来。可我就是不让他去，深恐吉姆一觉睡醒会走过来。但是汤姆非要冒这个风险不可。所以嘛，我们就偷偷地溜了进去，拿了三支蜡烛，汤姆还把五个美分的蜡烛钱留在桌子上。随后，我们走出厨房，我急巴巴地要拔脚就走，可是汤姆偏要匍匐爬回到吉姆那儿去跟他逗着玩儿。我只好等着他，仿佛等了好半天似的，因为四下里都是一片寂然荒凉。

汤姆一回来，我们就沿着小路赶紧离开，绕过花园的围栅，不觉来到了屋子对面很陡的小山顶上。汤姆说吉姆头上戴的帽子已被他摘下来，挂到吉姆头顶上一根树桠枝上了，当时吉姆只是稍微挪动了一下，但并没有惊醒过来。从此以后，吉姆常说那时他给妖怪迷住了，先是使他昏迷过去，接着骑在他背上走遍全州，最后才把他挪到那棵大树底下，再把他的帽子拴到树桠枝上，让他知道是谁开的玩笑。及至吉姆第二次说这件事的时候，他就索性说那是妖怪骑在他背上到新奥尔良去了。打从这回以后，他每说一遍，就添枝加叶地越编越多，直到最后，他竟然会说那时妖怪骑着他周游全世界，差点儿没把他累死，至今他的后背上到处都是被当马骑得来的鞍疮。吉姆对这件事总觉得很了不起，这么一来，别的黑人通通不在他眼里了。当时有许多黑人是从好多英里以外赶过来听吉姆讲这件事的，所以他在这个地区也就比任何一个黑人都更让人钦佩。许多外乡来的黑人，常常张开大嘴巴，从头到脚地打量着他，简直把他看成一位奇人似的。通常黑人都是围着灶间的炉火，坐在暗头里扯谈妖魔鬼怪。但赶上有哪一位对这类事大谈特谈、仿佛无所不知的时候，吉姆就会顺便插上一句，说：“嘿，妖怪的事你知道个啥？”于是，那个黑人的嘴巴一下子就被他堵住，不得不退坐到后面的座位上去了。吉姆始终把那个用绳子拴起来的五美分钱币挂在脖子上，说是妖怪亲手给他的一个护身符，那个妖怪还亲口关照过他，说这个护身符可以用来给人治病，而且不管在什么地方，他只要对它念上几句咒语，就能把妖怪差遣来。至于他念的咒语是什么，他从来都是守口如瓶。许许多多黑人打从四面八方赶到这儿来，还给吉姆带来他们所尽有的礼品，仅仅是为了看一眼那个价值五美分的饰物；可是他们谁都不敢触摸它一下，因为那个玩意儿是魔鬼用手摸过的。这么一来，吉姆可真给毁了，哪儿还像个佣人呢。因为他跟魔鬼见过面，还驮着妖怪走天下，自然而然他就趾高气扬起来了。

再说，我和汤姆俩来到了山顶边沿上，俯看下面那个村子[1]，见到有三四处灯光忽明忽暗，说不定那里有人得了病。我们抬头一看，只见满天星光灿烂，煞是好看。村子边沿那条大河，宽度足足有一英里，出奇的静谧而有气势。随后，我们下了山，看见乔·哈珀和本·罗杰斯[2]，还有别的两三个孩子，全都藏在老制革厂里。我们解开一只尖头平底小划艇的缆绳，顺水而下，走了两英里半，到达山脚下一块大陡岩坡才上了岸。

我们径直来到一片灌木丛里，汤姆先让大家起誓保守秘密，随后指给大家看——那个恰好位于长得最密的丛林深处的山洞。接下来我们就点亮蜡烛，匍匐爬行，钻了进去。我们爬行了约莫二百码，这个山洞就豁然敞开了。汤姆正在一条条通道之间摸索，忽然朝着一道石壁底下弯下身去——因为在那里，你要是不注意的话，很难发现有一个洞口。于是，我们就从这很窄的洞口钻了进去，来到了一处类似房间的地方，四周围都湿漉漉、冷飕飕的。于是，我们就地停住了。汤姆说：

“咱们这个强盗团伙，定名为汤姆·索亚帮，现在就算开张了。哪一位想要加入，就必须当众宣誓，此外还得用指血签上自己的名字。”

他们每个人都很乐意。于是，汤姆掏出一张纸，他已在纸上拟好了誓词，这时就照念了一遍。誓词上说：汤姆帮的每个成员要效忠本帮，永不泄密。如果有人伤害了本帮成员，那么，谁被指派去杀掉那个人和他的家属，就得照办不误；而且在杀掉仇人，并在他们的胸前画上本帮“十”字标记之前，不得吃饭，也不得睡觉。凡是不属于本帮的人，都不准使用本帮标记，如果冒用，必定受到控告；如果再冒用，就得杀掉他。本帮成员如果泄密，就得割断他的喉管，接下来焚尸扬灰，并用鲜血把他的名字从名单上除掉，本帮再也不提他，还要诅咒他，而且永远忘掉他。

大家都说这篇誓词真漂亮，就问汤姆是不是他自己动脑子想出来的。他说里面有一部分是，其他的是他从写海盗和强盗的书[3]里抄来的；他还说，这样的誓词每一个唱高调的团伙全都有的。

有人认为最好把泄密的那个成员的全家人都给杀掉。汤姆说，这个点子倒是很好，就用铅笔把它写上去。不料本·罗杰斯却说：

“哈克·费恩[4]没有家——那你该怎么处置他呢？”

“嘿，他不是有个老爸吗？”汤姆·索亚说。

“不错，他倒是有个老爸的，可是眼下你怎么都踅摸不到他。过去他常喝得烂醉，在制革厂里跟猪睡在一块儿，不过已有一年多这里没见过他的影儿了。”

他们扯了一会儿，想要把我排除在外，因为他们说，每一个成员都得有个家或者有个什么人，以便格杀勿论，要不然对别的成员来说就不公平了。是啊，当时谁也想不出好点子来——大家都怔住了，哑口无言。我差点儿要哭了，可是我心中忽然生出一计来，就把沃森小姐提出来——他们不妨杀她呀。于是，大家都说：

“哦，有了她就行，有了她就行。没关系。哈克可以入伙。”

他们都用尖针扎指后冒出的鲜血来签名，我就在那纸上签字画押。

“那么，”本·罗杰斯说，“咱们这个帮打算干啥呀？”

“净干抢劫、杀人的事呗，”汤姆说。

“可是，咱们去抢劫谁呢？是打家劫舍呢还是偷牲口去——还是——”

“胡扯！偷牲口那等事，算不上抢劫，那是窃贼，”汤姆·索亚说，“咱们不做窃贼。做窃贼不过瘾，咱们是拦路强盗。咱们要戴上假面具，拦住大路上的驿车、马车，先把人通通给杀了，再把他们的钱财拿来。”

“难道说咱们非得动不动就杀人吗？”

“哦，当然咯。那是上策呗。尽管有些行家里手另有看法，但大多数人认为最好把人干脆杀掉。除了你把几个人关押在这个洞里，一直到来人赎回去。”

“赎回去？什么叫赎回去？”

“我也不知道。不过别人家都是那么干的。我在书里头就见到过，所以，我们当然也得那么干。”

“不过，咱们既然不知道那是怎么回事，又哪能干得了？”

“得了，见他的鬼去吧，反正咱们就得这么干。我不是跟你说过，书里头都是那么写着的吗？难道说你不打算照书里头写的那样干，让事情全给乱了套吗？”

“嘿！汤姆·索亚，说起来倒是挺好听，可是，既然对那些人怎么个赎法我们也不懂得，那又怎么让他们都给赎回去呢？这个问题我倒想闹个明白。你估摸一下那是什么意思？”

“哦，我可不知道。不过，也许是要把他们关押到他们被赎回去，那也就是说：要把他们关押到他们死了为止。”

“哎哟，这么说还差不离。这个问题就算给解决了。你干吗不早说呢？我们关押他们，一直到他们死了为止——他们总是把东西吃得精光，还动不动想要逃跑，说实话，也真够讨厌。”

“你怎能那样说呢，本·罗杰斯。有看守盯住他们，只要他们动一下，就用枪将他们扫倒在地，他们还会跑得了吗？”

“还有看守！哦，那敢情好呀。所以，还得有人整夜值班，不准打盹儿，这样看守才能盯住他们。我想那么做太蠢了。为什么他们一到这儿，就不先让他们挨一顿棍打，然后就给赎回去呢？”

“因为书里头写的并不是这样——原因就在这里。喂，本·罗杰斯，你想不想照常规办事呀？——好点子就在这儿。难道说你觉得写书的人不知道该怎么做才合适吗？难道说你觉得你自己就能开导点拨他们吗？还差一大截！不，伙计，我们只能照常规让他们赎回去。”

“好吧。我可不介意；不过，反正我觉得那是个笨办法。喂——我们对女人也照杀不误吗？”

“得了，本·罗杰斯，我要是像你那样不懂事，怎么也不会不懂装懂。要杀女人？不，那种事谁都没在书里头见到过。你把她们请进洞里来，对她们总是客气极了，没多久她们就爱上了你，再也不想回家了。”

“哦，要真的是那样，我倒是很赞成，不过我不相信这个。洞里很快就会被那些女人和等着赎回去的男人挤得满满的，这么一来，我们当强盗的连个立足之地都没有啦。不过，你尽管往下说吧，反正我已经没得可说的了。”

这时候，小托米·巴恩斯已经睡着了。大家一叫醒了他，他就害怕了，哭着说要回家找他的妈妈去，再也不当强盗了。

于是，大家都拿他开玩笑，管他叫作哭鼻子小伢儿，这么一来，他可气坏了。他说他马上就把我们的全部秘密都给捅了。但是，汤姆给了他五美分，叫他静下来，并说大家都回家去，下个星期再碰头，一块儿去抢东西，杀几个人。

本·罗杰斯说，除了星期日，平常不能外出，所以他想不妨从下个星期日开始。不料所有的成员都说，星期日干这种事，实在缺德透顶，当即给否定了。他们都赞成尽量早点碰头，好择定日期。随后，我们选了汤姆·索亚当队长，乔·哈珀当队副，接着就动身回家了。

我攀上矮棚屋，从窗子里爬进屋里，这时天边刚刚透亮。我的新衣服上沾满油垢和泥巴，而且我自己也累得几乎要死。

第三章


转天早上，沃森小姐一见我的脏衣服，就痛骂了我一顿。可是寡妇并没有咒骂我，却替我把油垢和泥巴都洗刷干净了。她脸上露出不满的样子，反而让我觉得自己赶明儿得尽量学乖些。随后，沃森小姐领我到内室[1]做祷告，可是结果什么都没有。她关照我天天做祷告，说不管我想要什么，全都能得到。可事实上并不是那样。反正做祷告，我曾经试验过。有一回，我踅摸到一根钓鱼的线，但是没有钓鱼钩。没有钓鱼钩，对我来说，那根钓鱼线也就毫无用处。为了要钓鱼钩，我曾经做过三四次祷告。可是不知怎的总是不灵验。后来有一天，我请沃森小姐代我做祷告，可她却说我是个傻瓜。个中原因她从来没有告诉过我，我自己也就压根儿弄不懂了。

有一回，我坐在后面的树林子里，就这件事暗自琢磨了好长时间。我心里想：如果说一个人靠做祷告，就可以要啥有啥，那么，迪肯·温卖猪肉亏损了的钱干吗就找不回来呢？寡妇丢失了的银鼻烟壶干吗也找不回来呢？沃森小姐干吗老是胖不起来呢？反正不行，我心里想，做祷告一点儿结果也不会有的。我跑去向寡妇如实相告，她却说人们从祷告中得到的东西，只是一些“精神礼物”。这对我来说一点儿都不需要，可是她把她的意思传达给了我——说我必须帮助别人，尽自己力量替别人做事，还要始终关心照顾他们，从来也不要想到自己。依我看，沃森小姐也包括在这里头。我就跑到树林子里去，心里又反复思考了好半天，可我还是看不出做祷告会有什么好处——除了对别人以外——所以到最后，我觉得自己再也不必为它犯愁，还不如随它去就得了。有时，寡妇把我叫到一边，谈到有关上帝的事，有滋有味儿，真让人差点儿流出口水来[2]。可是，也许在第二天，沃森小姐斩钉截铁地说的那一套，就把这一切又全给推倒了。我敢肯定自己看出来的上帝就有两个：在寡妇的上帝跟前，一个穷小子也会大有希望，不过要是沃森小姐的上帝把他找去，那他就再也得不到什么帮助了。这一切我通通想过了：我认定自愿跟着寡妇的上帝去，只要他肯收下我。尽管我也闹不明白他收下我以后，他的日子怎能会比过去更好，因为说实话，我这个人是那么愚蠢、卑劣，而脾气又很犟。

老爸他有一年多没露面儿了，这可使我觉得好痛快；我压根儿不想再见到他。赶上他没有喝醉、还能抓住我的时候，他总是狠狠地揍我；虽然一见他在跟前乱转悠，我绝大部分时间常常躲到树林子里去。约莫在一年前这个时候，他被人发现淹死在河里了，那个地点据说是在河上游十二英里附近。反正人们断定确实是他；并且说这个淹死的人，正好跟他的模子一样大小，身穿破衣烂衫，头发特别长——哪儿都像老爸——只不过脸儿一点儿也认不出来，因为它泡在河水里的时间太长，早已不像人的脸儿了。据说他是脸儿朝天，漂浮在水面上。人们把他打捞上来，就掩埋在河岸上了。可是我心里还没有宽慰多久，就偶尔想起一件事来了。反正我知道得极清楚，凡是淹死的男人浮在水面上，绝不会脸朝上，而一定是脸儿朝下的。所以，当时我就知道：此人断断乎不是老爸，肯定是一个身穿男装的女人。于是，我心中又感到七上八下了。我敢断定那老爸没多久还会回来，尽管我并不巴望他回来。

我们隔三差五地扮演一回强盗，约莫有一个月的光景，后来我就洗手不干了。所有的孩子也都不干了。反正我们没抢过什么人，也没杀过人，只不过是装装假罢了。我们常从树林子里蹿出去，冲撞一下那些放猪倌和大车上装着菜蔬去赶集的女人。可是我们从来没有把他们里头哪一个抓起来。汤姆·索亚管那些猪仔叫作“大块头”，管萝卜青菜叫作“珠宝疙瘩”。我们回到洞里，常常扯一扯我们出击的结果，算一算杀过多少人，画过多少标记。可我还是看不出这里头有什么好处。有一回，汤姆派一个孩子举着熊熊燃烧的火棍，在城里头到处转悠——他管这火棍叫作“广而告之”，是这个强盗帮集合的信号——随后，他说自己接到探子送来的密报，转天有大队人马的西班牙商人和阿拉伯富豪，将在霍洛洞里扎营住宿，跟他们一块儿随行的有二百头大象、六百匹骆驼、一千多匹“拖”（驮）骡，满驮满载都是钻石，可他们拢共也只有四百名卫兵。所以嘛，我们不妨打埋伏——这是用他的话儿说的——包管杀上一大批，把所有的东西全都抢过来。他说我们都得把刀枪拾掇拾掇，做好准备。他哪怕是去追赶拉萝卜的大车，从来都要把刀枪擦得干干净净；其实，说穿了，这些刀枪只不过是一些木板条和笤帚把罢了，尽管你累得要死，把它们擦得干干净净，到头来还像是连一点儿吹灰之力都没有，跟没擦洗以前一模一样。我不相信我们能打败这大队人马的西班牙人和阿拉伯人，不过我倒是很想亲眼看看那些骆驼和大象。所以，转天星期六，我早就埋伏在那里。我们一接到命令，就从树林子里一跃而出，冲下山去。不料，什么阿拉伯人和西班牙人都没有，骆驼和大象也没有。只有一群主日学校的学生在那儿野餐，他们还都是读读识字课本的初级班小学生。我们冲散了他们，把那伙小孩子赶出洞去；可我们还是一无所得，除了一些炸面圈和果子酱。本·罗杰斯好歹拿到一个布娃娃，乔·哈珀拿到一本赞美诗和一本福音小册子。不料领队老师冲了过来，我们马上扔下东西拔脚就跑了。什么钻石不钻石，我都没见到，我就这样对汤姆·索亚说了。可他却说反正那里有的是满驮满载，还有的是阿拉伯人和大象，如此等等。我就问他：那为什么我们偏偏见不到呢？他说，我只要不是那么愚昧无知，而是看过那本叫作《堂·吉诃德》的书[3]的话，那我用不着问就会知道了。他说这一切都是施用魔法的结果。他说那里就有好几百名卫兵，还有大象和金银财宝等等，但他又说我们的敌人就是魔术师。他们分明是不怀好意，才把大队人马一下子变成了儿童主日学校的学生。我说，那么，好吧，我们就只好去找那些魔术师算账。汤姆·索亚却说我是个大笨蛋。

“哼？”他说，“魔术师会召来一大拨妖怪，说时迟那时快，它们早就把你砸得个稀巴烂了。它们个儿就跟大树那么高，像教堂那样硕大无朋。”

“得了，”我说，“如果说我们也找几个妖怪来助我们一臂之力——那我们能不能打败那一帮子人？”

“那你又怎样去找它们？”

“我可不知道。那人家怎么会找它们来的？”

“嘿，人家在一盏旧镀锡铁皮灯或是一个小铁环上用手擦一擦，刹那间四下里又是闪电雷鸣，又是黑烟滚滚，那些妖怪就飞也似的都跑过来了。于是，你要它们给你干什么，它们就给你干什么。甚至于要它们把一座制弹塔连根拔起，猛砸那主日学校校长等人的脑袋都成——这对妖怪它们来说简直不算是一回事[4]。”

“是谁要它们飞也似的跑过来？”

“嘿，反正不管是谁，只要用手擦一擦镀锡铁皮灯或者小铁环，谁就能让它们飞也似的跑过来。妖怪是要听从那个擦灯磨铁环的人的差遣，它们也必须听从这个人发出的命令。他要是关照它们用钻石盖一座长达四十英里的宫殿，里面装满了口香糖，或是装满了你想要的什么什么东西，而且还让中国皇帝的女儿过来跟你结婚，它们都一一照办不误——而且还得在转天清晨出太阳以前办成。除此以外，它们还得轻而易举地扛着这座宫殿周游全国，不管你爱上哪儿，它们就扛到哪儿，你明白了吗？”

“哦，”我说，“我想它们才是一帮子笨蛋，不把宫殿给自己留着，反而让自己的时间白白地给浪费了。再说——如果说我是妖怪的话，我才不会扔下自己的正经事，冲着擦一下旧铁皮灯的那个人老远跑过去。”

“哈克·费恩，你怎么说这话呀。他只要擦一下灯，你就得跑过来，不管你愿不愿意。”

“什么呀，我就是跟大树那么高、像教堂那样硕大无朋的吗？那敢情好；我是会来的；可我准会吓得那个人爬到乡下最高的大树顶上去的。”

“呸，哪有这回事呢？跟你说话简直是白搭，哈克·费恩。看来你是什么都不懂，不知怎么的——你这个十足的傻瓜蛋。”

我对所有这些事思考了两三天，随后，我想要看一下这里头到底有一点儿名堂没有。我踅摸到一盏旧镀锡铁皮灯，还有一个小铁环，跑到树林子里去，擦了一遍又一遍，结果汗流浃背，就像印第安人干苦活似的。我打算先盖一座宫殿，回头再把它卖掉。可是，一点儿都不管用，一个妖怪都不来。于是，我揣摸那一大套话，只不过都是汤姆·索亚胡编乱造出来的。我认为他是相信阿拉伯人和大象的，但是至于我呢，我却有不同的看法。那明摆着都是主日学校留下的印象。

第四章


三四个月一晃而过，现在已是寒冬季节。我差不多天天都在上学，在拼音和读写方面已学会了一点儿，乘法口诀居然还能念到六七三十五[1]了。我认为自己即使会活一辈子，至多也只能到此为止，不会再有大长进。反正我对算术一点儿也不感兴趣。

开头，我憎恨学校，可是没有多久，我总算还能凑合过去了。实在太累时，我就逃学，转天挨的那一顿痛打，对我倒有好处，能让我振作起来。所以，我上学的日子越长，我就越觉得容易混下去。我对寡妇的举止言谈都有点儿习以为常了，也不觉得那么恼人了。住在家里，睡在床上，把我绷得真够紧的。反正还没到冷天，有时我常常溜到树林子里去睡觉，我偏偏觉得那样才算是真正休息。旧的习惯原是让我最最恋恋不舍，但新的生活现在我也有点儿喜欢了。寡妇说我日有所进，虽然慢，但是很稳，对我的言行表现非常满意。她还说我可没有给她丢脸。

有一天早上，我在吃早餐时，不巧把盐瓶子碰翻了。我赶紧伸过手去，想把那些盐屑撒到左肩膀后面去，免得触霉头。不料，沃森小姐却抢先拦住了我。她说：“快撒手，哈克贝利——你老是弄得好脏呀！”寡妇虽然给我说过好话，但是也并不能让我不触霉头，这我心里非常明白。我吃过早餐就往外走，心里烦恼不安，暗自纳闷，真不知道自己要在哪儿触霉头，也不知道触的是什么霉头。要避免触霉头，自有好多办法，可这一回另当别论，所以，我断断乎不再去琢磨什么对策了，只是没精打采、多留几分警觉心地径直往前走去。

我不觉来到了前头的花园，爬过台阶，从那高高的围栅穿过去。地上刚下过雪，已有一英寸厚，我看到雪地上有人踩过的许多脚印。一看就知道脚印是从采石场那边过来的。那个人在台阶附近站过一会儿，随即绕过花园围栅走去。奇怪的是那个人在附近站了半晌，但并没有走进去。我真是百思而不解。反正这是非常离奇古怪的。我原想循着脚印径直往前踅摸去，但我还是先弯下身去看了一下。开头，我并没有发觉有什么，但再看一下，却看出来了：那左靴子的后跟上，有个大钉子钉的十字架——一个驱魔避邪的十字架。

我赶紧站起身来，往山下跑去。我不时回过头去看看，可什么人都没见到。我喜滋滋地跑到了撒切尔法官的家里。他说：

“哎哟哟，我的孩子，瞧你跑得连气都喘不过来了。你这是来取利息吗？”

“不是的，先生，”我说，“有我的利息吗？”

“哦，有的，昨儿晚上刚收进半年的利息，总共是一百五十多块钱。对你来说，这是很大的一笔钱。你最好还是让我替你把它跟你那六千块钱加在一块儿放利去。你要是把它取走，就会把它花掉了。”

“不，不会的，先生，”我回答说，“我可不想把它花掉。我压根儿不想要它了——连那六千块钱都不想要了。我巴不得你把钱全都拿走——那六千块钱，还有别的钱，我通通送给你。”

他露出大吃一惊的样子，好像摸不着头脑似的说：

“哎呀，我的孩子，你到底是什么意思呀？”

我说“：这事请你别追问，好不好？你就把钱拿走——行不行？”

他说：“哦，我简直给闹糊涂了。出了什么事吗？”

“请你都拿去吧，”我说，“什么事也别问我——那我就用不着再撒谎了。”

他暗自思忖了一会儿，接下来就说：

“哦，哦，我想我闹明白了。你是想把你全部家什都卖给我——而不是送给我。那就符合你的意思了。”

于是，他就在一张纸上写了一些字，接着把它念了一遍，说：

“得啦——你看，这上面写着‘为了换取一点儿补偿’。那就是说，我从你手里买下了，把钱都付给你了。这一块钱是给你的。现在你就签字画押吧。”

我签字画押以后，就离开了。

沃森小姐的黑奴吉姆，有一个像拳头那样大的毛团，那是从一头牛的第四个胃里取出来的，他常用它来变戏法[2]。他说这毛团里头有一位神仙，它真可以说是无所不知，无所不晓。那天夜里我就过去，对他说我老爸又上这儿来了，因为我已发现雪地上有他的脚印。我想要知道：老爸他究竟打算干啥来的，是不是要待在这儿不走？吉姆掏出毛团来，冲它嘀咕了几句，随后把它举起来，一撒手，就让它掉在地上了。它沉甸甸地掉在地上，仅仅滚动了一英寸左右。吉姆又试过了一回，继而再试了一回，可结果都是原样不变。吉姆两膝跪下，用耳朵贴着毛团听了一会儿。但是没什么用；他说这个毛团硬是不肯说话。他说，有的时候，不给钱，毛团就不说话。我跟他说，我手头有一枚古老而又光溜溜的二十五美分的假银币，一点儿用处都没有了，因为从镀银的币面上已露出一点儿铜痕来了。不过，即使没露出铜痕来，说什么也不好使用：它光溜溜像抹上一层油似的，所以每次都露馅儿了（法官给我的那块钱，我想对他还是一字不提为好）。我说那是一枚要不得的伪币，不过也许毛团会把它收下，说不定它不会知道这枚伪币与真的银币之间有差异。吉姆把伪币接了过去，先是闻了一下，接着又咬了一下，还用手擦了好几遍，说他自有办法，让毛团把它当作真的银币。他说他只要剖开一块生土豆，把伪币掖在里头过一宿，转天早上你就看不出铜痕来了，摸上去再也不觉得油汪汪的了。到了那时候，小镇上不管是谁，都会马上把它收下，更不用说那个毛团了。说实话，过去我也知道土豆有这种妙用，不过当时我却全给忘了。

吉姆把这枚二十五美分硬币放在毛团底下，又俯下身来在地上听了一下。这一回，他说毛团可灵验了。他说：它可以给我这一生算算命，如果我乐意让它算命的话。我说，那算就算吧。于是，毛团对吉姆说话，吉姆再把它的话说给我听。他说：

“你的老爸还不知道自己将要干啥。有时候他说自己要出远门，回头他又说自己要留下来。最好还是让他老头儿自己决定。有两位天使老围着你老爸转：一位是白晃晃的，另一位是黑糊糊的。白天使要他往正道上走。过了一会儿，黑天使却过来跟他胡搅蛮缠了。现在谁都说不清哪一位天使最后会迷住他。依我看，你命里还真不赖哩。你这一辈子将会碰到很多麻烦，也会有很多开心乐事；有时候你会受伤，有时候你还会生病，不过每次都会痊愈的。你命里注定有两位姑娘追你，一位是肤色浅黑的，另一位是黑皮肤的，而且一位穷，另一位富。你会先娶那个穷丫头，以后再娶那位阔小姐。再说，你要尽量离开有水的地方，越远越好，可千万别冒险，因为命书里写着赶明儿你会被人绞死的。”

那天夜里，我点上蜡烛，上楼回到卧室，却见老爸——分明是他本人——正端坐在那儿！

第五章


我把门关上，侧过身来，见到他坐在那儿。过去我总是害怕他，他动不动就揍得我够戗。我原以为自己到现在还很害怕，可是我一下子发觉自己的想法错了。这就是说，开头我是大吃一惊，简直让我连气都喘不过来——对他的回来，我原是始料所不及的；但是过了一会儿，我心里就释然了：我并不害怕他，对他也用不着心有余悸。

老爸他差不多有五十岁了，看起来也像是那把年纪。他的头发又长又乱，油腻腻的，老是耷拉着；你会看到，他的两只眼睛不时在闪闪发光，仿佛他躲在葡萄藤蔓后头往外张望似的。他满头都是黑发，一根白丝也没有；他那又长又乱的络腮胡子也是这样。从他露着的那一部分脸面上，一望可知他面无血色，很白，但并不是像别人那种白，它是一种惨白色，看上去让人恶心，浑身起鸡皮疙瘩——是一种既像雨蛙，又像鱼肚皮的白色。至于他的衣着——只是一身破褂子罢了。他把一只脚踝搁在另一条腿的膝盖上。那只脚上的靴子早已开裂，露出两个脚指头，他还不时在抖动。他的那顶帽子搁在地板上——那是一顶黑色帽边低垂的旧帽子，帽顶早已塌了下去，像个盖子似的。

我站在那儿瞅着他，他也坐在那儿瞅着我，他让椅子往后翘高一些。我把蜡烛放下来。我发觉那窗子正敞着，由此可见他是从棚屋上爬进来的。他老是从头到脚端详着我。过了一会儿，他说：

“上过浆的衣服——真帅呀。你自以为是蛮够大佬的派头，可不是？”

“难说呗，也许是，也许还不是。”我说。

“不许你跟我乱顶嘴，”他说，“我走了以后，你摆上臭架子了。我非得煞煞你的威风不可。听说你还受过教育，读读写写都行。现在你自以为比你老爸更有能耐啦，因为他老头儿什么都不会，可不是？我可得拿你来出出气。嘿，谁让你瞎掺和去干那种翘尾巴的蠢事？——是谁指使你的？”

“寡妇。是她让我干的。”

“嘿，寡妇？——那么，又是谁让寡妇瞎掺和来管闲事呢？”

“谁也没让她来管。”

“得了吧，我来教给她怎么个瞎掺和吧。你就听着——赶明儿你干脆停学了，听见了没有？我可得教训教训那些人，因为他们教出来的孩子，总是对亲爸爸摆架子，装得比亲爸爸还有能耐似的。你要是再上学校鬼混去，可小心别让我逮住，听见了没有？就是你妈活着的时候，读读写写她都不会。我们家祖祖辈辈也没有哪一个会的。就说我也都不会；可是你现在却神气活现，像煞有介事似的——我这个老子可受不了——听见了没有？喂，你就给我念叨念叨吧。”

我拿起一本书来，开始念了有关华盛顿将军和几次打仗的事。我刚念了半分钟，他抬起手来照着那本书猛击一下，就势把它扔到里屋去了。他说：

“果然不假啊。你真的会念书了。刚才你跟我说的时候，我还半信半疑呢。现在你先听着：你别再摆架子了。我可看不惯。我会暗中等着你，你尽管自作聪明好了；我要是在学校附近逮住你，准定狠揍你一顿。首先，你要知道你上了学还得信教哩。我从来没见过你这么个儿子。”

他随手捡起一张蓝黄两色、画着牧童放牛图的小画片，说：

“这是什么？”

“这是他们给我的东西，就因为我功课好。”

他一下子把它撕碎了，说：

“得了，我给你的东西更好——我这就用牛皮鞭子抽你。”

他坐在那里，哼哧哼哧地嘟哝了一会儿，就说：

“那你岂不是成了一个涂脂抹粉的花花公子吗？你有一张床，床上铺的盖的等等全有，此外还有穿衣镜，地板上铺的是地毯——可是你的亲爸爸还得上制革厂，跟猪睡在一块儿。我可从来没见过像你这么个儿子。我非得打掉你的臭架子不可。啊，你的臭架子怎么老是摆不完呢？——再说，人家都说你发大财了。嘿，这是怎么回事呀？”

“他们胡扯——就是这么回事。”

“你听着——你跟我说话可得小心点儿。现在，凡是我能容忍的，我都容忍啦——所以说，你就不用跟我乱顶嘴了。我来到小镇上，已有两天啦，别的我没听见，净听人家说你发大财啦。我在河下游老远也听说过啦。我是专程为这件事来的。赶明儿你把那些钱全都交给我——我就是要钱。”

“我没有钱。”

“你胡扯。钱都在撒切尔法官那儿。你快去取来。我就是要钱。”

“我跟你说，我就是没有钱。你尽管去问撒切尔法官好了，他跟我说的也是一样。”

“好吧，我这就去问他。我可要让他把钱交给我，要不也得给我一个说法。再说——你口袋里还有多少钱？通通给我。”

“我只剩一块钱，我还打算去——”

“我才不管你有什么打算不打算——你就得给我交出来。”

他把那块钱接了过去，用嘴咬了一下，得知真假以后说马上去小镇上弄些威士忌酒来，又说他整整一天还没喝过哩。可他刚爬到棚屋顶上，却又把头探进来，臭骂我摆架子，硬要胜过他老爸。后来，我估摸他已经走了，没料到他又把头伸进来，关照我若再上学，可得小心点儿，因为他会暗中等着我，要是我不停学，他就会揍我。

转天，他喝得醉醺醺。他来到撒切尔法官家里，骂骂咧咧，硬要对方把钱交出来，可是法官断断乎不肯交出来。于是，他赌咒发誓说，定要上法院状告撒切尔去。

法官和寡妇全都来到了法庭上，先要让我跟父亲脱离关系，再由他们里头的一个来做我的监护人。可是这位新来乍到的办案法官压根儿不了解这个老家伙，所以他说法庭除非出于无奈，万万不会插手干预，把一家老小都给拆散了；说他怎么也都不忍心让一个做儿子的无端离开他的亲爸爸。因此，撒切尔法官和寡妇对这件事也只好撂手不管了。

这么一来却使老头儿喜不自胜。他说我要是不给他踅摸一些钱，他就用牛皮鞭子抽得我身上青一块紫一块。我向撒切尔法官借了三块钱，老爸拿了钱去沽酒，喝得醉醺醺，就到处去乱吹乱骂，乱吵乱闹；他手里还敲着铁皮锅，就这么着闹遍了全镇，一直到深更半夜。那时，人们就把他关押起来，转天带他上法庭，判处他为期一周的监禁。哪知道他说他可满意极了；他说他终于把儿子管住了，也好让儿子他吃不了兜着走。

他打从监狱里一出来，那位新任职的法官说打算让他重新做人，于是把他带到自己的寓所，给他穿扮得清清爽爽，叫他跟家里人共进早餐、午餐、晚餐，对他真可以说是美不滋儿。晚餐以后，法官给他大讲有关戒酒节欲等大道理，使这老头儿听后直落眼泪，说自己一直是个傻瓜蛋，把一辈子的光阴都给浪掷了；可是，今日里他要洗心革面，重新做人，再也不丢人现眼了。他希望法官乐意帮助他，而不要瞧不起他。法官说，听了他说的这些话，恨不得把他紧紧搂在怀里；于是，法官哭了，他的太太又陪哭了一回；老爸说从前他这个人老是被人误解，法官说相信刚才他说的话。老头儿说倒霉的人顶需要的是同情，法官说这话一点儿也不错；于是，他们又都哭了起来。到了该睡的时候，老头儿就站了起来，伸出自己的手来说：

“先生们，女士们，请诸位看一下，抓住我的这只手，握一下吧。这只手过去被当作猪爪子的，可现在再也不是猪爪子了；这是一个开始过新生活的人的手。我死也不再走回头路了。你们千万可要记住这些话——别忘了这是我说的。现在，这是一只干净手啦；握一下吧——别害怕呀。”

于是，他们都来跟他一一握手，禁不住又都哭了。法官的太太还亲吻了一下那只手。随后，老头儿当众发誓戒酒——还签字画押过呢。法官说这是破天荒的特大奇闻，或者是类似这样的话。然后，他们把老头儿带到楼上一个漂亮的房间——一个闲置着的房间——大约到了夜半时分，他因酒瘾大发作，就从窗口爬到门廊顶上，顺着立柱滑下去，用一件新外套换回了一大壶本地酿的威士忌酒[1]，这才又爬回房间去，大快朵颐地过了把酒瘾。到天蒙蒙亮的时候，他早已喝得东倒西歪了，可他又往外头爬出去，不巧从门廊顶上滚了下来，左胳膊上摔破了两处，险些没冻死，多亏太阳一出来就被人发现了。人们来到那个空房间往里一看，房间里满地是酒，他们进房间之前，还得先测估一下房间里酒的深度。

法官心里着实有点儿不好受。他说依他看只好用强迫的办法，也许这个老头儿还能改邪归正，舍此以外，他怕再也想不出别的招数来了。

[1]这种威士忌酒很烈，40杆（220码）以外就能醉倒人，因此又名“40杆酒”。





第六章


没多久，老头儿养好了伤，又能到处转悠了。于是，他上法院去状告撒切尔法官，让他把钱交出来。他还跑来找我，说我并没有停学。他逮住了我两回，狠狠地揍了我，可我还是照样上学，多亏是我躲着他去，或是赶在他前头滑脚溜了。过去，我倒是并非很想上学，可现在为了藐视老爸，我反而觉得非上学不可。法院里办事原是慢条斯理的，他们好像老是不想着手去办；所以，我不时向法官告借两三块钱给他，免得老挨皮鞭子。他每次拿了钱就去喝到醉；每次他喝醉了酒，就在小镇上闹事；每次他闹事就被关押起来。这对他来说最合适也没有——因为干这等事，他才是里手行家。

他老是在寡妇的住处转悠，所以寡妇到最后跟他说，他要是再不离开那儿，她就要找他麻烦来了。那么，他是不是疯了？他说他要给大家看看：哈克·费恩到底是听谁的。入春后，有一天他死死盯住我，一把逮住了我，一块儿下了小划子，带到河上游大约三英里的地方，随后到了河对岸伊利诺伊州。举目望去，全是一片大森林，没有人家，只见一座旧时小木屋，四周围树木茂密，你要是不知道它的坐落，那就断断乎找不着它。

他让我老是守在他身边，我就始终没有机会逃跑。我们住在那个旧木头房子里，每到晚上，他总是把门锁好，钥匙就枕在自己脑袋底下。他有一支枪，我估摸他是偷来的，我们捕鱼打猎，全靠那个过日子。没多久，他把我关在房里，自己到离渡口三英里的一家铺子去，用鱼和野味换一些威士忌酒回来，一醉方休，接下来却把我狠揍了一顿。不久，寡妇终于探听到我的着落，就派了一个人来，打算把我叫回去。可是老爸却用枪把那个人给撵走了。打那以后不久，我对我的落脚处已经习惯，而且喜欢上了——除了挨皮鞭子那类事之外。

整天价游手好闲，抽抽烟，钓钓鱼，不用读书，不动脑筋——这就是地地道道的好逸恶劳。两个多月一晃就过去了，我身上的衣服已是又破又脏，我可弄不懂那时我竟会那么喜欢寡妇家里的那套规矩：吃饭前你先要洗手，然后就着盘子吃，头上要梳得端端整整，定时睡觉和起床，永远抠书本子，还得让沃森小姐一天到晚没完没了地找我的碴儿。我可再也不打算回去了。我本来已经不骂街了，因为那个寡妇不喜欢，可现在我又骂骂咧咧了，因为老爸他一概不反对。总的说来，树林子里的那些日子，是过得美滋滋的。

不过没有多久，老爸他动不动就操起那根山核桃木手杖打我，我可实在吃不消了。我满身伤痕累累。他还老是爱往外头跑，却把我关在房间里。有一回，他把我关了起来，一出门三天三夜没回来。那真让人给憋死了。我估摸他是淹死了，我就一辈子都出不去了。那可把我吓得要命。我就下决心，千方百计要离开那里。本来我好多次就打算从那木头房子逃出去，可老是踅摸不到好办法来。这儿连让狗钻得过去的小窗口都没有。我从烟囱里又爬不出去——那毕竟太窄了。房门是用厚实的橡木板做的。老爸出门时挺小心，没让刀子之类的东西留在房间里；我想我在房间里到处翻寻过多达一百遍了。得了，我差不多一直不停在翻寻，这几乎是我消磨时光的唯一方法。不料，这一回我终于踅摸到了：我找着了一把长满锈斑、没有把手的旧锯子，它正好塞在房椽子和护墙楔形板之间。我给它抹上一点儿油，就动手干开了。这幢房子离门最远处，有一张桌子，它的后面有一块旧的盖马毯子，钉在圆木护墙壁上，以免裂缝里灌进风来，把蜡烛火吹灭了。我爬到桌子底下，撩起毯子，动手把靠墙根那大圆木锯去一段，它的大小正好够我身子钻得过去。这可是一件很费时的活儿，不过在我刚要干完的时候，却听到老爸的枪从树林子里传来的响声。我就赶紧拾掇干净，放下毯子，把锯子收藏起来。不一会儿，老爸他就进来了。

瞧老爸他正在发脾气——他生来就是这副德行。他说这次他去小镇上办事，样样都不顺当。他的律师说，赶上有一天真的开庭了，他认为他准能把官司打赢，取到那笔钱。可是话又说回来，人家有的是办法，使它长期延宕下去，何况撒切尔法官很会来这一手的。接着，他说，有人认为还会有另一次庭审，一是要我跟他脱离关系；二是让寡妇做我的监护人；而且有人猜测，这一回他们准能把官司打赢。这些话可使我大吃一惊，因为我压根儿不愿意再回到寡妇家里去受管束，正如他们所说的，要让我变得文明[1]一点儿。那时，老头儿就开口大骂了，凡是他能想得到的每一个人、每一件事全都骂了，随后又从头到尾再骂了一遍，保证他一丁点儿也没有给漏掉。在那以后，他又笼而统之地骂了一遍，挨骂的还包括一大拨他连名姓都不知道的人。因此，他在提到那一拨人时，就管他们叫作“那个姓啥名谁的人”，接着又一个劲儿骂下去。

他说他倒是很乐意看看寡妇究竟能不能把我夺回去。他说会小心提防的；如果说他们要想跟他耍这一类的把戏，他知道离开这里六七英里，就有一个地方，好把我藏在那里，让他们东寻西找，累得要死也找不着我。这一下又让我忧心忡忡，但过了一会儿，我想等他找到那个机会时，也许我就早已不在这儿了。

老头儿要我到小划子上去拿他弄到手的东西。那里头有五十磅重的一口袋玉米粉，半头熏咸肉，一些弹药，一罐四加仑重的威士忌酒，加上一本旧书，两份报纸，都是给枪支里装填火药时用的，此外还有一些短麻屑。我扛走了一驮，再回来坐在小划子里歇息。我全都仔细考虑过了，我想赶明儿出逃时，要把枪支和一些钓鱼线一块儿捎着，逃到树林子里去。我想将来我不会老待在一个地方，我硬是要安步当车，穿过全国，多半在夜里赶路，靠打猎钓鱼过活。这么一来，就好跑到天涯海角去，那时老头儿和寡妇再也踅摸不着我啦。我估摸当天夜里我就会锯出个窟窿来，离开这里，如果说老爸他已喝得醉醺醺的话；我揣想他肯定是喝得烂醉了。我一心净想着这件事，连自己在这儿待了多久都记不得，直到老头儿大声嚷嚷，问我到底是睡着了，还是给淹死了。

我把那些东西全都扛进了小屋，天差不多黑下来了。我正在做晚饭的时候，老头儿喝了一大口或许是两大口，就有点儿醉醺醺了，于是，他又开始乱说、乱讲、乱骂了。原来他在小镇上已经喝醉过了，跌倒在臭沟里一整夜，他那副德行真够瞧的。他浑身上下都是泥巴，真的会被人当成亚当[2]呢。每当他酒性发作的时候，他老是抨击政府。这回他就那么说开了：

“这个也算是叫作政府吗！得了，你一看就知道它是个啥玩意儿。居然有这种混账法律，随时都想抢走人家的儿子——人家的亲儿子，人家耗尽了心血，省吃俭用，好不容易才把儿子拉扯大了。是啊，人家刚把儿子拉扯大了，儿子正要出道来报答一下他老子，好让他老爸歇口气，这时候法律却登上门来跟他套近乎。亏他们还管那个叫作政府！可这还不算完呢。法律竟给撒切尔法官那个老家伙做后台，帮他的忙，让我眼巴巴看着自个儿的财产，却老是到不了手。这就是法律的功德呀。法律抓住了一个可值六千多块金币的老倌，把他硬塞进这么一个又破又旧捕鼠器似的小屋里，让他穿着连乡巴佬穿都不相配的衣服踅来踅去。亏他们还管那个叫作政府！在这样一个政府底下，谁还能得到属于他的权利吗？有时候，我真恨不得离开这个国家，永远也不回来了。不错，这话我早就给他们说过了；我就是当着面对撒切尔老兄说的。有好多人都听见过，我说过的话他们都能说得出来。我说，我即使不为了什么也要离开这个该死的国家，以后永远都跟它不沾边了。这就是原话，一个字儿都不错。我说，诸位就看我这顶帽子吧——如果说你们还管它叫作帽子的话——帽盖一掀上去，帽檐耷拉下来，把我的下巴颏儿都给遮没了，它压根儿算不得是一顶帽子，倒是更像我的脑瓜儿硬被塞进一节火炉烟筒里去了。你们都瞧着，我说——这样的一顶帽子让我去戴——好歹我还是这个小镇上的大款之一，如果说我能得到属于我的权利的话。

“哦，得了，这才是个了不起的政府，真的可了不起。嘿，且听我说吧。有一个自由的黑人，打从俄亥俄州[3]来的；他是个穆拉托[4]，可是肤色几乎跟白人一样白。他身穿白得耀眼的衬衫——头上戴着一顶闪闪亮的帽子；整个小镇上都找不着一个人穿得像他那样漂亮；他还有一块金表，拴着一根金链条，手里拄着一根头上镶银的手杖——是全州最让人敬畏的一位满头白发的大阔佬。那你们猜怎么着呢？人们说他是一位大学教授，会说各个国家的话，而且，什么玩意儿他样样都懂。可那还不算是最要不得的。人们说他在老家那里的时候，还有投票权。嘿，那可真让我受不了。我心里琢磨，这个国家到头来会搞成个什么样儿呢？那天正好是选举的日子，要是我没喝醉、走得动的话，我自己也还打算去投票呢。但是有人告诉我，说我们这个国家有一个州，会让那个黑鬼投票的，我就撤回来了。我说赶明儿我再也不去投票了。这就是原话，一个字儿都不错；他们全都听见的；我们这个国家烂掉了，我也管不着——反正我这一辈子再也不去投票了。瞧那个黑鬼趾高气扬的样儿，——嘿，要是我没有把他推开，他自己还不会给我让路呢。我冲大家说，干吗不把这个黑鬼拍卖掉呢？——这正是我所要了解的事儿。你猜，他们说什么来着？听着，他们说他来到本州要是不满六个月，就不让拍卖；他来这儿日子还不长哩。哦，你看，这岂不是咄咄怪事。一个自由的黑人来到本州不满六个月，政府就不能拍卖，亏他们还管它叫作什么政府呢？得了，这是一个自命为政府的政府，装扮得像个政府，自以为是个政府，可还得纹丝不动地坐着，足足满了六个月，才去踅摸一个到处流窜、贼头狗脑、穷凶极恶、穿白衬衫的自由黑人，而且——”

老爸就这样一个劲儿数落下去，丝毫没注意到他那双灵巧的老腿会往哪儿迈去，结果，他栽了一大跤，摔进了腌咸猪肉的木桶里，把左右胫骨的皮都给磕破了，难怪他接下来说的都是最狠毒的话——多半是抨击黑人和政府，尽管把那个咸肉桶也一块儿捎上，大骂一通。他绕着小屋乱蹦乱跳了一会儿，先是踮起一只脚，随后踮起另一只脚，继而抱起一条小腿，接下来又抱起另一条小腿，最后冷不防他举起左脚，狠狠地踢了木桶一脚。不过这一招并不高明，因为他脚上穿的靴子，头上已裂开，露着两个脚指头。因此，他先是怒吼了一阵，简直令人发指，接着，他就干脆躺倒在地，捂住脚指头在污泥里乱打滚。那时他骂人的话，简直把他早先骂人的话全都盖过去了。后来，他自己也是这么说的。从前他听见过索伯里·哈甘老头儿在最得意时破口骂人，他说这回他把哈甘也都盖过去了；不过，我觉得这话也许有点儿夸张。

晚饭后，老爸端起酒壶来，说里头还有好多威士忌酒，够他喝个“两醉一昏”[5]。那是他常说的一句口头禅。我心里估摸，大约个把钟头以后，他就会喝得烂醉如泥，那时我就把钥匙偷走，或是锯个大窟窿逃出去，反正怎么都行。他喝了又喝，不一会儿就跌跌撞撞地摔倒在地上了。但是我很不走运。他并没有呼呼大睡，只不过是喝得难受罢了。但见他在呻吟、呜咽，两手来回地挥动了好长时间。最后，我也开始打盹儿了，怎么使劲都睁不开眼来，所以就迷迷糊糊地睡着了。这时，蜡烛也还没熄掉呢。

我不知道自己睡着了有多久，蓦然间听见了一阵可怕的尖叫声，我霍地爬了起来。瞧老爸他好像发疯了，一个劲儿来回蹦跳，大声呼喊蛇来了。他说那些蛇正往他两腿上爬着呢；随后，他又纵身一跳，尖声喊叫，说有一条蛇咬住了他的腮帮子——可是我压根儿没有看见什么蛇不蛇的。他又跳了起来，一个劲儿在小屋里跳来跳去，还大声乱嚷嚷：“快点儿砸死它！快点儿砸死它！它在咬我的脖子呀！”我从没见过一个人的眼里露出这么惊恐万状的神色。没多久，他着实累坏了，先是横倒地上直喘气，接下来他又开始乱打滚，滚得出奇地快，而且到处乱滚，两腿乱踢，两手向空中乱砸乱打，一迭连声地尖叫，说妖怪们把他给逮住了。不一会儿，他实在筋疲力尽了，这才安静下来，躺倒在那里不断呜咽。到后来，他几乎越发纹丝不动，一气不吭了。我只听见远处树林子里猫头鹰和狼的嚎叫声，觉得寂静得怪可怕。他还在那边墙角里头躺着。过了半晌，他才支起身子来，歪着脑袋仔细听。他几乎悄没声儿地说：

“哒拉——哒拉——哒拉；那是死人大踏步走过来呀；哒拉——哒拉——哒拉；他们就是来抓我的；可我偏偏不想去呀——乖乖，他们已经到啦！别碰着我——好不好！快撒手——手冰冰冷呀——饶了我吧——唉，得了吧，别管我这个穷鬼呀！”

随后，他四肢着地爬着逃命，苦苦哀求他们饶了他；他用毯子把自己裹了起来，滚到那张旧松木桌子底下，仍然在乞求着；后来，他就开始哭了。透过毯子，我还是听得见的。

没多久，他从桌子底下滚出来，猛地一跃而起，好像疯了似的。他一看见我，就冲了过来。他举起一把叠式刀，在小屋里来回地追赶我，管我叫作“催命鬼”。他说他要宰了我，我就再也不会来催他的命了。我乞求他，告诉他我只不过是哈克罢了。不料，他先是那么尖厉刺耳地咧嘴一笑，跟着大吼一声，破口大骂，照旧继续追赶我。有一回我刚侧转身来，打算从他胳膊底下躲闪过去，哪知道他轻轻地一把抓住我的夹克衫后领，我想这回我可完了。可是我像闪电那么快，一滋溜从夹克衫里蹿了出来，这才算逃了命。一转眼，他就筋疲力尽，躺倒在地上，后背靠着房门。他说不妨先歇一会儿，回头再来宰我。他把刀子放在身子底下，说他先睡片刻，养精蓄锐，以后嘛，他要再看看究竟是鹿死谁手。

一转眼，他就打盹儿了。我连忙把灌木条做椅座的椅子移过来，尽量轻手轻脚地爬到椅子上，一声不响把那支猎枪取了下来。我用铁条往枪筒子里捅了两下，得知里头确实装上了弹药，就把猎枪横放在萝卜桶上，枪口对准老爸，而我却坐在枪后面，等着他身子一动马上开枪。哪知道这一段时间要挨过去该有多慢、多静啊！

第七章


“起来！你在干什么呀！”

我睁开眼睛，张望了一下，想要知道自己究竟是在什么地方。那时候已是日上三竿了，原来我一直是在呼呼大睡。老爸站在旁边，俯看着我，露出烦躁——还兼有讨厌的神情。他说：

“你拿这支枪在干什么呀？”

我估摸他压根儿不知道他自己出过什么洋相，所以就说：

“有人想要闯进来，所以我正伺机等着他。”

“你为什么不叫醒我？”

“得了，我是叫过的，但怎么也叫不醒你；而且，我推又推不动你。”

“那么，好吧。别整天价站着说废话。你赶快出去，看看钩上有没有鱼，好开早饭。我过一会儿就来。”

他给房门开了锁，我一出门就直奔河岸去了。我发觉好几根大树主枝和诸如此类的东西从河上游漂下来，此外还有稀稀落落的一些树皮。我知道大河已开始涨水了。我心里想，现在我要是在小镇上的话，一定会过得很快活。六月里，大河一涨水，我历来交好运，因为赶上涨大水的日子，总会有成捆出售的木材漂浮下来，还有零散的木筏——有时候十几根大圆木拴在一起；你只要把这些木材打捞上来，转手卖给木行和锯木厂就得了。

我顺着河岸往河上游走去，一只眼睛看着老爸来了没有，另一只眼睛看着涨大水会带给我什么东西。蓦然间，有一只小划子漂下来了，那还是一只漂亮透顶的小划子，约莫有十三四英尺长，活像鸭子似的兴冲冲奔过来。我有如一只青蛙似的，连衣服也没脱掉，就冒冒失失地冲下河岸，径直去抓住那只小划子。那时，我还以为小划子里头一定有人躺着，因为有些人常常会那样做，旨在愚弄别人，比方说，等到有人划着小船快要靠近了，他就从小划子里一跃而起，冲着来人哈哈大笑。不过这一回并不是那样。这是一只漂失了的小划子，一点儿都不错，我爬上小划子，就把它划到岸边。我心里琢磨，老头儿看见这只小划子准高兴——它少说要值十美元。不过等我上岸的时候，还没看见老爸的影儿。我正把它划到一条两岸都长满了藤蔓和柳树的类似水沟的小溪去，这时忽然又有一个闪念从我脑际掠过。我想我还是先把小划子好好地隐藏起来，以后我逃跑的时候，就用不着溜到树林子里去了；我只消顺水划上五十多英里，就可以在一个地方一劳永逸地住下去，再也不要徒步行进，疲于奔命了。

这里离那幢木头房子相当近，我仿佛觉得不时听到老头儿走过来的声音；等我把小划子藏好后，就来到了一片柳树那里张望了一下，只见老头儿独自一人沿着小路走过来，一面还举枪瞄准了一只鸟。所以说，他倒是什么都没看见。

他走过来的时候，我正在使劲往上拉“滚钓线”[1]。他嫌我手脚慢，骂过我一两句。可我告诉他，刚才我跌到河里去了，所以耗费了那么长时间。我知道他看见我浑身上下湿漉漉的，准定要问这问那。我们从滚钓线上取下五条鲇鱼，就一起回家了。

我们吃过早饭，身子就躺倒下来，歇息一会儿——我们两个几乎都是累坏了——这时候，我心里想，要是我能想出一个点子来让老爸和寡妇再也不想跟踪追寻，那可就比抢在他们找到我之前侥幸地跑到远处更有把握得多了。你知道，什么事情都可能发生。反正我当时说什么也想不出一个点子来。过了半晌，老爸他支起身来，又喝了一圆筒水，说：

“下回只要有人偷偷地溜到这儿来，你可千万要叫醒我，听见了没有？那个人上这儿来，肯定是不怀好意。我就得用枪毙了他。下回你可千万要叫醒我，听见了没有？”

随后，他身子倒下来，又睡着了——谁能料到他嘴里念念有词，恰巧给我出了一个好点子。我暗自思忖，现在我都已安排好了，所以，不管是谁都休想跟踪追寻我了。

大约十二点钟，我们就外出，顺着河岸上走。河水涨得相当快，许多木材趁着涨水漂过去了。过了一会儿就漂过来一块木筏——由九根圆木紧紧地拴在一起。我们坐上小船赶过去，就把它拽到岸上来。接下来我们开始吃午饭。除了老爸以外，不拘是谁都会整天价守在这儿，巴不得多打捞一些东西；反正那可不是老爸的作风。一次捞到九根圆木，已经算够多的了；他非要马上推到镇上去卖掉不可。于是，他就把我锁在屋里，约莫在午后三点半上了小船，终于把木筏给拖走了。我揣想，那天晚上他是回不来的。我在屋子里等着，直到我想他已经开走了，我就把锯子拿了出来，继续锯那段圆木。赶在他到达河对岸之前，我已从那个窟窿里头钻出来了。那时候，他和他的木筏在远处水面上只不过是一个圆点儿罢了。

我把那口袋玉米粉挪到藏小划子的地方，使劲拨开藤蔓和树枝，把它放到船上。我又同样把那半头咸猪肉搬过来，接下来搬那壶威士忌酒；我把所有的咖啡和糖，以及所有的火药，全都拿过来了；我拿了装火药用的填料，还有水桶和水瓢；拿了一把长柄勺和一只洋铁皮杯子，我的那把旧锯子和两条毯子，还有长柄平底煎锅和咖啡壶。我还拿了钓鱼线和火柴，以及许多别的东西——只要有点儿用处的东西，通通拿过来了。我把那个地方都给腾空了。我少不得要有一把斧子，可是屋子里一把都没有，只有屋子外头木柴堆旁边的那一把，而我之所以把它留下来，反正我自己心里有数。至于那支枪，我也拿出来了，现在我可算是万事齐备了。

我打从那个窟窿里先是爬出来，又拖出来那么多的东西，还把窟窿外头的地面都给磨平了。我就从窟窿外头尽力收拾残局：往地上撒一些泥土，让平滑的地面和锯屑都给遮盖起来。随后，我把锯下来的那段圆木放回原处，用两块石头垫在它底下，另一块石头顶住那段圆木——因为那段圆木在原处有点儿弯，不能着地。你要是站在四五英尺远的地方。不会知道它已被人锯过，也断断乎看不出破绽来。再说，此处正是在小屋背后，未必有人会逛到这儿来。

过了一片草地，才到了小划子那里，所以我连一个脚印都没有留下。接下来我往四下里张望了一下。我站在河岸上，举目眺望河上。平安无事啦。我就提着枪，独自走进树林子，四处踅摸打鸟，这时候我忽然间看见一头野猪，原是从大草原农场里跑散的猪，没多久却在那片低洼地里越发变野了。我冲这家伙开了一枪，就让它回老家啦。

我抡起斧子砸房门——我把它砸了个稀巴烂。我把野猪拖进屋里，几乎背靠着桌子，随后一斧子冲它的嗓子眼砍去，让它躺在地皮上流血——我说的是地皮，因为那确实是地皮——是砸得铁硬的地皮，而不是地板。接着，我拿了一条旧麻袋，往里装进许多大石头——只要我拖得动，反正有多少就装多少——我先从拖猪开始，拖着口袋出了门，穿过树林子，来到河边，猛地把它扔到河里，一转眼沉下去，看不见了。你一眼就能看出究竟是什么东西在地皮上刚拖过。我真巴不得汤姆·索亚当时在场，我知道他对这等事很感兴趣，他还会异想天开，锦上添花哩。汤姆·索亚精于此道，谁也比不上他。

最后，我自己揪下好几根头发，给斧子涂上猪血，让头发粘在斧子背面，就把它扔到屋子角落里。随后，我抱起那头猪，搂在自己怀里，而且还用夹克衫裹住（所以它的血就不会滴出来），一直到了离屋子老远的地方，才猛地把它扔到了河里。现在，我忽又想起了另一个点子来。所以，我径直跑过去，把那口袋玉米粉和我的那把旧锯子，都从小划子取出，带回屋里来。我把口袋仍然放回原处，用锯子在口袋底下开了一个小洞，因为屋子里没有吃饭用的刀叉——老爸烧饭做菜的时候，不管切什么东西，都用他那把折叠刀。随后，我就扛着那口袋，穿过草地和屋子东边的柳树林，约莫走了一百码，才到了一个五英里宽的浅湖，那湖里长满灯心草——赶上那个季节，你就会说，湖里野鸭子可多着哩。有一块沼泽地，或者叫它小河沟，从浅湖的另一端流向好多英里开外的地方——它究竟流到哪儿，我都说不准，反正没有流向大河。玉米粉偏偏从口袋子里漏了出来，在通往浅湖的路上留下一道粒粒屑屑的痕迹。我还把老爸的磨刀石掉在那里，仿佛是偶然掉下来似的。随后，我把口袋上的漏洞，用细绳子扎好，所以它再也不漏出来，接着又把玉米粉口袋和锯子都带到了小划子上。

这时，天快黑下来了；所以，我让小划子顺水漂到那些伸向河岸上空的柳树底下，等着月儿升上来。我把小划子拴在一棵柳树上；接着吃了点儿东西。过了一会儿，我躺在小划子里抽了一口烟，心里在琢磨对策。我暗自思忖，他们一定会循着那袋石头的痕迹来到河边，随后在河上到处搜寻我。他们还会踩着玉米粉的痕迹来到湖边，再沿着湖的另一端小河沟去寻找那些先是杀掉我、再把东西抢走的强盗。反正他们到河上来只找我的尸体，此外再也不会找别的。过不了多久，他们对这件事就会感到厌倦，不再为我犯愁啦。得了，那我高兴待在哪儿就待在哪儿了。我觉得，杰克逊岛[2]倒是蛮够好的；那个岛我可知道得一清二楚，而且从来没有人到过那里。再说，一到夜里，我还可以划船过河，偷偷摸摸地到小镇上去，捡一些我手头短缺的东西。杰克逊岛就是个好地方嘛。

这时，我觉得很困倦，就迷迷糊糊地睡着了。醒来时，我竟一时不知自己身在何处。我坐了起来，举目四望，心里不觉有点儿害怕。那时我才想起来了。这条河望过去仿佛有好几英里宽。月儿照得特别明亮，连河面上漂过来的圆木，虽说离河岸有好几百码远，黑糊糊的，静止不动的，但我照样都能数得出来。四下里一片死寂，看来天色已晚，这从闻到的气息中也可以知道了。料你一定会懂得我的意思——我真不知道该用什么词儿形容才好。

我打了一个哈欠，伸了伸懒腰，刚要解开缆绳把小划子开走，这时我听到远处水面上有一种声音。我仔细倾听了一会儿，立时就闹清楚了。那是万籁俱寂的夜里桨架上摇桨时发出的一种隐隐约约，而又有规律的声音。我透过柳树枝条往外窥望，只见那里——有一只小船，远在水的那一边。这只船上有多少人，我可说不上来。眼看着它越来越靠近；当它跟我并肩时，我才看见这船上拢共只有一个人。我想，此人也许是老爸，尽管我并没指望他会来。他从我眼皮底下顺流过去了，没多久划到平缓的流水处，就摇摇晃晃地登上了河岸。当他紧挨着我一闪而过时，我要是把枪伸出去，就会碰着他。得了，此人正是老爸，准没有错——而且从他操桨的把式一望可知，他还没有喝醉哩。

我就不失时机，马上穿过岸边的树影，飞快地顺水而下，过了两英里半，接着又有四分之一英里，开始划向河的当中，因为不一会儿我就要过渡口，说不定有人见到我，会来招呼我。我就势划到随波漂流的木材中间去，身子平躺在船底，让小划子随波漂浮。我就躺在那儿，抽着烟斗，好好地歇歇力；仰望蓝天，只见万里无云。反正你在月光底下仰卧着，遥看天际总是显得那么深不可测；这是我从来都不知道的。而且，在这样的静夜里，你可以从水上听到很远的地方传来的声音！我听见人们在渡口码头上闲聊天。我还听见他们所说的话，一字字，一句句，都听得很真切。一个男的说，现在马上就要变得昼长夜短了。另一个男的说，依他看，这一夜可不算短呀——他们听了全都哈哈大笑；于是，此人跟着又重说了一遍，他们又都哈哈大笑了；随后，他们唤醒了另一个人，把这话转告了他，又都哈哈大笑了，不料这一个人并没有哈哈大笑，反而出言不逊地说切莫招惹他。头一个人说他回头要把这话说给他的老婆听——她就会觉得妙不可言的；不过他说若要跟他当年说过的话相比，这种话也就一钱不值了。我听见有一个人说现在快三点钟了，并说他巴望白天可别姗姗来迟，非要等上一个多星期不可。打那以后，谈话声就越来越远了，我再也听不清他们的话语了，不过我还能依稀听到一些咕哝声；偶尔也有一阵笑声，但好像是很远很远的了。

现在，我离开渡口已经很远了。我站起身来，只见杰克逊岛就在前头，约莫在河下游二英里半的地方——这个树木繁茂的岛，仿佛是从河的当中凸显出来的。它那又大、又黑、又壮实的形体，赛过一艘无灯光照明的大轮船。岛前沙洲连一点儿影子都看不见——全给大水淹没了。

我没费多长时间就来到了那里。我健步如飞地穿过岛的顶端——那里水流湍急——随后来到一处死水[3]那里，并在毗连伊利诺伊州这边上了岸。我让小划子直奔我所熟知的岸边一个凹坑。我还得拨开柳树枝条方才进得去；反正我把小划子拴好后，从外头谁都看不见它。

我上了岸，坐在岛的顶端一根圆木上头，举目眺望这条大河，只见水上漂着黑不溜秋的木材，三英里外的那个小镇上，有三四处闪闪发亮的灯光。这时，河上游一英里多的水面上，有一座大得可怕的木筏慢慢悠悠地顺流而下，木筏的正中央还打着灯。我眼看着它缓缓地漂过来，等它快要打从我身边经过的时候，我听见有一个人喊道：“喂，稳住尾桨，头往右边靠啊！”我听得很真切，好像说话的人就在我身边。

这时，天边已经露出一点儿鱼肚白。我走进树林子里，躺了下来，想在吃早饭前先睡一会儿。

第八章


等我一觉醒来时，太阳已经升得很高了，我估摸准定八点过了。我躺在阴凉的草地上想这想那，觉得刚歇过一阵子，因而相当舒畅、满意。透过树阴里的一两个隙孔，我看得见太阳，但四周围多半是参天树木，置身其间总觉得暗无天日。阳光从树叶之间筛落下来，地面上就有斑斑驳驳的光影，那些光影稍微移动一下，说明一阵微风刚从上空吹过。有一对小松鼠栖在枝头上，冲我怪亲热地唧唧喳喳叫。

我顿时觉得浑身懒洋洋，舒服极了——压根儿不想起来做早饭。是的，我又在打盹儿了，猛地我仿佛听到从河上游远处传来的轰隆隆的一声，声音十分沉重。我马上一跃而起，支起一只胳膊肘侧耳倾听。过了一会儿，我又听到了轰隆隆的一声。我单脚跳着跑过去，打从树叶之间的一个隙孔往外看。我看见河上游远处——大约紧挨着渡口——河上有一缕白烟。渡船上满载着人，向河下游漂过来。现在，我才明白那是怎么回事了。轰隆隆的一声！我看见一缕白烟从渡船旁边喷上来。你看，他们正在河上放炮，想把我的尸体给炸上来。

我肚子饿得很，可现在生火我觉得不合适，因为他们一眼就会看见烟。所以，我只好坐在那里，远望着冒烟听炮响。那里河面宽达一英里，在夏日里的早上，望过去总是好看极了——所以嘛，只要我有一点儿东西下肚，我坐着看他们寻找我的遗骸也是够快活的。于是，我无意之中想起，他们常给面包里灌水银，再让它们漂在水面上，因为这么一来，面包总是直奔溺死者，而且到了那里就会停住不动。所以，我说，我可要留神观察，要是有这样的面包漂过来寻找我，我就不会让它们错过机会。于是，我换个地方，来到小岛毗连伊利诺伊州的这一边，看看我的运气好不好，但我总算并没有失望。一个加倍大的面包漂过来了，我用一根长棍子刚要把它打捞上来，不料我脚下一滑，它又漂远了。当然咯，我正好处在急流离河岸最近的地方——那一点我心里够明白。但没多久又漂过来一个，这回我可得胜了。我拔掉面包上的塞子，抖掉里面那一点儿水银，咬了一口。那可是“面包师傅做的正宗面包”——是高门鼎贵府上佐餐用的——绝不是你们那种不值钱的玉米面包。[1]

我在树叶子当中找到一块好地方，坐在一根圆木上头，一边啃面包，一边看那只渡船，真可以说心满意足了。忽然间我想起了一件事。我心里想，现在寡妇或是牧师或是其他的人一定在做祷告，但愿这面包能踅摸到我，此时此刻它果真漂来这里踅摸到我了。所以毫无疑问，那种事的确有点儿管用。那就是说，像寡妇或者牧师那样的人做祷告，是有点儿管用的，但对我却一点儿都不灵；我觉得只是对正常人，它就偏偏不管用。

我点了烟斗，痛痛快快地抽了好半天，继续观看。渡船顺着水急漂而来，我想它一漂过来，自己准有机会看得见谁在船上，因为渡船会像面包那样从我身边擦过。眼看那只船就要过来了，我就熄了烟斗，来到刚才我捞面包的地方，躺在岸边一小块空地上的一根圆木后头。从圆木的凹陷中间，我可以往外窥视。

不一会儿，渡船过来了，它漂过来，离岸那么近，他们只要铺上一块跳板，就好走上岸来。几乎所有的人都在船上。老爸、撒切尔法官、贝茜·撒切尔、乔·哈珀、汤姆·索亚、他的波莉老姨妈、锡德和玛丽，还有别的一大拨人。人人都在谈论这起凶杀案，可是船长猛地大声喊道：

“现在千万要小心留神。这儿水深见不到底，说不定他被大水冲到了岸上去，拴到河沿的矮树丛里了。反正我真巴不得是这样。”

可我并不指望这样。他们全都簇拥过来，身子靠着铁栏杆往外探，差不多就在我面前。他们还是一气不吭，全神贯注地察看着。我能把他们看得一清二楚，但他们却看不到我。随后，船长大声嚷道：“闪开！”就在我跟前轰隆隆一声炮响，那声巨响把我耳朵快要震聋了，那股浓烟几乎使我眼睛都要瞎掉了，我料想这一回自己可死定了。他们只要真的装上了炮弹，我估摸他们正在寻找的尸体准能找着。反正谢天谢地，我总算一点儿也没挂彩。渡船继续朝前漂过去，绕到岛的顶端边上就看不见了。偶尔我还能听见一两声炮响，反正越来越远了；过了个把钟头以后，我就再也听不见了。这个小岛有三英里长。我估摸他们已经到了小岛的末端，不会再来寻找了。岂料他们一下子还不甘心罢休。他们从小岛的末端掉过头来，顺着毗连密苏里州那边的河道，奋力开上来，而且还不时在放炮。我就跑到这边来察看。他们来到岛的顶端就不再放了，随即在毗连密苏里州那边上了岸，都回到镇上老家去了。

我知道我现在平安无事了。再也不会有人来寻找我了。我把随身携带的东西从小划子里取出来，好让我在密林里安营露宿。我用毯子好歹也算支起一个帐篷，把我的东西都放在里头，以免下雨时淋湿了。我逮了一条鲇鱼，用锯子把它胡乱劈开来，到了太阳快要下山的时候，我才燃起一堆篝火，凑合着吃了顿晚饭。随后，我又撒下钓线去逮些鱼来权当转天的早饭。

天色已黑，这时我坐在篝火边抽烟，感到满意极了；可是过了半晌，却又觉得有点儿憋闷了。所以，我就走到岸上去，坐在那里，听听河水激荡的响声，数数天上的星星，数数河上漂过来的圆木和木筏，随后回转去睡觉。在你憋闷的时候，这是消磨时间最好不过的方式；管保你不会老是那么憋闷，你一下子就会心情舒畅了。

三个昼夜就这样一晃而过了。一丁点儿差异都没有——总是那老一套。不过，到了第四天，我就到小岛各处去察看地形。如今在这小岛上，是我说了算数，整个小岛都归我所有，所以，凡是有关小岛的情况，我通通要了解；不过主要还是我想消磨时间罢了。我找到许多长得既成熟、味道又好的草莓；还有许多未熟的夏天葡萄，未熟的紫莓，和才露出来的未熟的黑刺莓浆果。不久，它们熟透了时，便可随手采摘，我想。

我在这深林里东逛西游，到后来我料想自己离小岛的末端不远了。我的那支枪，我一直随身带着，但是什么东西我都没打；那是仅仅为了自卫罢了。我想在快要到家时随手打一些野味。大概就在这时候，我差点儿踩着好大的一条蛇，那条蛇一出溜钻进了野花草丛里，我赶紧追过去，想给它一枪。正当我健步如飞之际，突然间我一脚踩着了一堆还在冒烟的灰烬。

我的心几乎从胸中蹦了出来。我还来不及看个仔细，就把枪上的扳机拉下来，踮起脚悄悄地尽快溜回去。我时不时停住片刻，在茂密的枝叶之间仔细听一会儿；但是我呼吸得太急促，什么都听不见。我又偷偷地溜行了一段路，回头再仔细听一会儿；我就是这样走一段，再听一会儿，不断重复下去。如果我看到一段树桩，我就以为那是一个人；如果我踩断一根树桠枝，我就觉得仿佛我的呼吸已被人断成两截，我只有一截，还是那短的一截。我回到了宿营地，我倒也不觉得非常性急了，我什么胆量都没有了；但是我说，这可不是闲逛的时候。所以，我又把自己的东西都搬到小划子上，就是不让别人看见。我先让篝火熄灭，然后把灰烬往四下里一撒，看起来好像是去年宿营地似的，随后我就爬上了一棵大树。

我估摸自己待在大树上已有两个钟头；但是我什么东西都没看见，我什么声音也没听见——我只是暗自思忖好像有成千上万的东西我都看见了、听见了。反正我可不能待在大树上一辈子；所以到最后我就下来了，可我还是让自己藏身在密林里，时时刻刻留神观察。我能踅摸到的吃食，就是一些浆果，以及吃早饭剩下的东西。

到了夜里，我肚子饿得真发慌。所以天一黑，我就赶在月儿还没升上来以前悄悄地离岸，划到河对面、毗连伊利诺伊州的岸上——约莫有四分之一英里的路程。我走到树林子里做了一顿晚饭。我差不多决定要在这里宿夜的时候，却听见一阵“踢踢踏踏”的声音，我自言自语道：“马来啦。”随后，我听见有人在说话。我连忙把自己所有的东西都搬上小划子，然后蹑手蹑脚地走进树林子，让自己仔细看个清楚。可我还没走多远，就听到有人在说：

“我们最好就在这儿宿营，如果说踅摸到好地方的话；马儿也差不多疲乏了。让我们到四处走一走，看一看吧。”

我毫不迟疑，把小划子撑离河岸，轻轻地划走了。我照旧把小划子拴到那个老地方，觉得自己干脆睡在上面就得了。

我并没有睡好，因为我老在想心事，不知怎的总睡不好。我每回醒过来，都觉得好像有人掐住了我的脖子。所以，睡觉对我来说可一点儿好处都没有。不久，我暗自思忖我可不能老是这样活下去；我要去看看究竟还有谁跟我一块儿在这个岛上；我非得把这件事弄个水落石出不可。主意既定，我心情立时觉得好多了。

于是，我操起桨来，先是撑离河岸一两步远，随后让小划子在阴影里顺水而下。月儿当空照，除了阴影以外，四下里都照得如同白昼一般明亮。我闲荡了足足有个把钟头，周围一切都像岩石一样安静，睡得很熟。这时，我差不多来到了小岛的末端。一阵凉飕飕的微风吹过来了，仿佛在说：黑夜差不多快要过去了。我用桨让小划子转过来，船头对着河岸；随后，我提着枪，悄悄地上了岸，来到树林子的边沿。我坐在那儿一大根圆木头上，透过树叶子缝隙往外看。我看到月儿已从天空中消失，黑暗开始笼罩着河面。不一会儿，我看见树梢上有一道灰白色，知道天快要亮了。于是，我手里握着枪，悄悄地朝着我碰见灰烬的那个地方走去，每过一两分钟就停下来听一下。无奈不知怎的，我很不走运，看来找不着那个地方。不过没有多久，千真万确，我看见远处树林子那边有一道篝火的闪光。我小心翼翼地、脚步很慢地朝它走过去。不一会儿，我已走到了它跟前，看见那儿地上躺着一个人，差点儿让我打了个寒战。那个人头上兜着一块毯子，他的头几乎碰着篝火。我坐在一丛灌木丛后面，离他大约六英尺左右，目不转睛地盯住他。这时，天已蒙蒙亮了。不一会儿，那个人打了个哈欠，伸了伸懒腰，随后掀开了毯子，原来就是沃森小姐府上的吉姆！老实说，我一看见他，真是喜出望外。我说：

“哈啰，吉姆！”我就连蹦带跳地走出来了。

他霍地一跃而起，两眼发疯似的直瞪着我。随后，他双膝跪下，双手合十对我说：

“千万别伤害我——千万别！我从来没伤害过鬼魂呀。通常我是喜欢死去的人，我总是尽力帮助他们。你还是回到河里去吧，本来你就是从那儿来的。千万别伤害老吉姆，他始终是你的朋友呀。”

我没费多大工夫，就让他明白我可并没有死。见到吉姆，我真的高兴极了。现在我不觉得憋闷了。我跟他说，我不怕他把我的落脚处去告诉他们。我一个劲儿说下去，可他只是坐在那儿，两眼直瞅着我，一言不发。后来我说：

“天已经大亮了。我们做点儿早饭吧。你先好好地把篝火生起来。”

“生篱火煮草莓那类东西吃，能管用吗？你有一支枪，可不是吗？我们包管踅摸到比草莓更好的东西呀。”

“草莓那类不值钱的玩意儿，”我说，“难道你靠它过活吗？”

“我踅摸不到别的东西呀。”他说。

“那么，你来这个岛上已有多久了，吉姆？”

“我是在你被人杀死的那天夜里来这儿的。”

“什么，已有那么长时间吗？”

“是——真的。”

“难道说你除了那些乱七八糟的玩意儿以外，就没得别的东西吃吗？”

“没得呀，先生——别的什么都没有。”

“那么，你一定快要饿死了，可不是？”

“我说恐怕一匹马我都能一口吃下去。我估摸包管吃得下去。你来这个岛上已有多久啦？”

“打从我被人杀死的那天夜里就来啦。”

“乖乖！那你靠什么东西过活呢？可你不是有支枪吗？哦，不错，你是有一支枪。那敢情好呀。那么，你去打一些东西来，我这就去生火。”

于是，我们来到小划子停靠的地方。他在树林子里一块开阔的草地上生好火，我就拿出来玉米粉、咸肉、咖啡、咖啡壶、长柄平底煎锅、白糖和洋铁皮杯子，让这个黑人见了以后迟疑了一会儿，因为他觉得这一切通通是施用魔术变出来的。我还逮了一条大鲇鱼，吉姆用他的刀把它刮洗干净，就往平底锅里煎煮了。

早饭做好了，我们没精打采地偎在草地上，趁热吃了起来。吉姆拼命地吃，因为他都快要饿死了。等我们把肚子都给填饱了，就懒洋洋地倒下来，仿佛躺死似的。

过了一会儿，吉姆说：

“喂，哈克，你说说，在那个小屋里被人杀害的，如果说不是你，那到底是谁呢？”

于是，我就把事情始末都讲给他听，他说这事干得真漂亮。他说汤姆·索亚也想不出比我的这个更好的点子来。随后，我就说：

“你怎么会到这儿来的，吉姆？你又是怎样跑到这儿来的？”

他显得相当尴尬，一下子语塞了。过了半晌，他才说：

“也许我还是不说好吧。”

“为什么，吉姆？”

“反正自有道理。不过，要是我跟你说了，你不会告诉人家吧，哈克？”

“吉姆，我要是告诉人家，就天诛地灭好了。”

“得了，我就相信你的话，哈克。我呀——我逃跑了。”

“吉姆！”

“但是，要记住，你说你不告诉人家——你知道你对我说过不告诉人家的，哈克。”

“是啊，我是说过的。我说我不告诉人家，决不失信。真的，绝对不假，我不骗你。人家都管我叫作低贱的废奴派，又见我老是默不作声而瞧不起我——不过，那都不要紧。反正我决不告诉人家，我压根儿不打算回去啦。所以，现在你就把这事原原本本说一说吧。”

“你看，就是这么回事。那位小姐——我指的就是沃森小姐——她整天价总是找我的碴儿，对待我粗暴极了，可她老是说她断断乎不会把我卖到奥尔良[2]去。不过，最近以来我看见有一个黑奴贩子，三天两头上门来，我就开始坐立不安了。再说，有天夜里，我悄悄地溜到门口，那时夜已很深了，可门儿还没关紧，我听得见老小姐跟寡妇念叨说，她打算把我卖到奥尔良去，说她自己本来还不愿意，可是她卖掉了我就能有八百块钱进账，那么一大堆钱，怎能不让她动心。寡妇劝她千万卖不得，不过后来她们说的话，我就没再听。我跟你说，我一下子溜得可快啦。

“我一溜出去就下了山，指望到离镇好几英里以外的河岸边，偷一条小船，没想到那时过往行人还不少，所以我就躲到河岸上那个快要倒塌的老箍桶铺子里，等人都走开了再说。反正我在那儿待了一整夜。那儿老是有人川流不息。约莫到了清早六点钟，就有好些小船打从这儿开过去了，等到八九点钟的时候，开过来的每一只船上，都在谈论你老爸怎么来到镇上，还有你又是怎么被人杀害了。后面过来的那些船上载满了女士们、先生们，他们都是到那肇事的现场看热闹去。有时候，他们靠在岸边歇息一会儿，随后再过河去，所以，从他们说的话里，我就知道了这起凶杀案的全部经过。哈克，我一听到你被人杀害了，心里真是难过极了，不过现在我心里就再也不难过了。

“我在刨花堆里头躺了一整天。我肚子里饿得够呛，但我并不害怕，因为我知道，老小姐和寡妇吃完早饭后，照例要下乡开布道会，整天价不在家。她们知道我天一亮就出门放牛去，她们不会指望我老待在家里，所以说，她们不到晚上断断乎不会来找我。别的佣人更不会来找我：因为只要那两个老娘儿们一出家门，她们早就溜出去歇假了。

“天黑下来了，我顺着河沿而上，约莫走了两英里多路，来到了那个没有住家的地方。我下定了决心，一不做，二不休。你知道，要是我还得靠两脚走着出逃，那些狗就会跟踪我；要是我偷了一只小船划到河对岸去，人家发现小船不见了，就会知道我在对面什么地方上了岸，而且还会知道怎样按照脚迹去找寻我。所以，我想来想去，一排木筏正是我求之不得的东西，因为它不会留下任何蛛丝马迹。

“过了一会儿，我看见一点儿灯光打从尖岬转过来，所以我就下了水，前面推着一根圆木，游过了河面一大半时，马上挨挤到那些漂在河上的木材里头。我一头扎进水里，有点儿逆水游去，直到后来，有一排木筏开过来了。我顺势游到木筏后梢头，紧紧抓住了它。这时候乌云当空，刹那间河面上漆黑一团。于是，我就只好爬上那排木筏，躺在木板上。木筏上的人，照例都在当中有灯亮的地方。河水在上涨，水流湍急；所以，我心里估算着，到凌晨四点钟，我顺水而下已有了二十五英里远了，随后，在天透亮以前，我打算悄悄地下水，游到岸上，直奔伊利诺伊州那边[3]的树林子去了。

“可是我偏偏很不走运。等我差不多快到小岛的顶端时，有一个人打着灯走到木筏的后梢头来了。我知道再等不管用了，就从木筏边上滑到水里，奋力向小岛游了过去。本来我想不管在哪个地点都能上岸，可总是不行——岸壁太陡峭了。等我差不多快要漂浮到岛的末端时，这才找到一个上岸的好地点。我来到了树林子里，心里就想自己再也不去木筏上鬼混了，因为他们时不时打着灯到处乱转悠。我把我的烟斗和一块廉价烟叶，还有一些火柴都塞进我的帽子里，因此并没有打湿。所以我还算蛮不错哩。”

“难道说你这么多天来一丁点儿肉和面包都没吃过吗？你干吗不逮几只香龟呢？”

“你倒说说怎么去逮呀？你总不能悄悄地走过去，伸手逮它们呀；再说，光用石块砸香龟，行吗？在夜里摸黑砸香龟，行吗？还有，我大白天怎敢跑到岸上来暴露自己。”

“哦，原来是这样。那你当然就只好老是待在树林子里。你听见过他们放炮了吗？”

“哦，当然听见过。我知道他们是在找你。我看见他们打从这儿过去的——我就是在灌木丛后头看到的。”

有好几只小鸟儿飞过来了，每次只飞一两码就停落下来。吉姆说这是快要下雨的征兆。他说小鸡这样飞就是快要下雨的征兆，所以，他猜想小鸟儿这样飞原来也是一回事。我正打算逮几只小鸟儿，可吉姆偏偏不让我逮。他说逮鸟是要死人的。他说有一次他父亲得了重病，正好有人逮了一只小鸟儿，他的老奶奶就说他父亲准会死的，后来他果真死了。

吉姆还说，做饭时你正在煮着的那些东西，可千万数不得，你只要数一数，准会倒霉的。太阳落山以后，你要是抖一下桌布，也是要不得。接着，他说，要是有人放养一窝蜜蜂，后来那个人死了，那么，转天清早出太阳以前就得给蜜蜂报丧去，要不然，那些蜜蜂都会得病，活儿干不了，通通死掉。吉姆说蜜蜂就是不螫傻瓜蛋，可是我偏偏不相信，因为我自个儿试验过好几回了，一回也没螫过我。

类似这样的怪事，从前我也略知一二，但不是全都知道。各式各样的征兆吉姆全都懂得。他说自己几乎什么都懂。我说，所有的征兆，依我看，都是说要让人倒霉的，所以我就问他，到底有没有让人交好运的征兆呢。他回答说：

“那可少得很——那种征兆对人也并不管用哪。你干吗要知道什么时候交好运呢？难道说你还是想要躲开它吗？”接着，他又说：“你要是胳膊上和胸脯上部长着毛，那就是你要富起来的征兆。这种征兆还是有点儿管用，因为那离眼前还远着哩。你知道，也许你先要穷上大半辈子，加上你要是不知道自己总有一天会富起来，那说不定你还会泄了气，想不开，自寻短见呢。”

“吉姆，那你的胳膊上和胸脯上都长着毛吗？”

“你问那个问题有什么意义呢？你还没看见我有吗？”

“那么说，你就是个富人吗？”

“不是，但在从前我可富过一回，将来还会再富起来。有一回，我手头有十四块钱，但我都拿去投机倒把，结果却是分文不剩。”“你做的是什么投机生意，吉姆？”

“反正开头我买了一头活货。”

“一头什么活货来着？”

“嘿，一头牲口呗——我说的是牛呀，你知道。我花十块钱买了一头牛。但是我再也不冒险去买牲口了。那头牛才买进，就死在我手里了。”

“那你的十块钱不是给白扔了吗？”

“不，我并没有全扔掉。我大约只扔掉九成。我把牛皮跟牛尾给卖了，还收回来一块一毛钱。”

“那你还剩下五块一毛钱。以后，你还做过什么投机生意没有？”

“做过的。你知道布拉迪什老先生家里的那个独腿黑人吗？你知道，他开过一家银行，他说，不拘是谁，存入一块钱，到年底准能得四块多钱。于是，所有的黑人都来存钱了，不过他们并没有多少钱。只有我一个人有钱。所以，我就冲着四块多钱来的，我还说过，我要是得不到那么多钱，干脆自己来开一家银行。那个黑人，当然咯，不乐意我来抢他的生意，因为他说没有那么多生意可做，用不着开两家银行，所以，他说我还不如把五块钱都存进去，到年底就付给我三十五块钱。

“于是，我就这么着存进去了。随后，我想要拿这三十五块钱马上去投资，好让这笔钱活起来。有一个名叫博布的黑人，他不知怎的踅摸到一条运木材用的平底船，那个船主却一点儿也不知道。我就从他手里把那条船买过来，告诉他到年底去银行领取那三十五块钱。不料当天夜里，那条船被人偷走了，转天那个独腿黑人就说银行倒闭了。所以说，我们谁都没有拿到一文钱。”

“吉姆，那你对一毛钱是怎么打算的？”

“得了，我本想把它花掉的。但是我做了一个梦，梦里告诉我把那钱交给一个名叫巴兰的黑人——人人都简称他为‘巴兰骑驴’[4]，他是他们里头的一个大傻瓜，你知道。但是他们说他很走运，而我知道我并不走运。梦里说，让巴兰拿这一毛钱投资去，他会给我赚大钱。于是，巴兰就把钱拿去了。可他在教堂里听牧师说，谁把钱捐给穷人，就像把钱借给上帝一样，谁一定会回收到一百倍的钱。所以，巴兰就把这一毛钱给了穷人，一气不吭地等着瞧有什么结果。”

“那么，结果是怎么样呢，吉姆？”

“什么结果都没有。我没办法把钱收回来，巴兰也一样收不回来。赶明儿我再也不把钱放出去了，除非我见到有抵押担保。听那个牧师说什么一定会回收到一百倍的钱呢！嘿，要是能把我那一毛钱找回来，就算是公平了；要是碰上这样的机会，我才高兴哩。”

“敢情好啊，吉姆，反正将来你总有一天会再富起来的，那就得了。”

“是啊——我现在就富起来了，你不妨看个仔细。我已属于我自己的了，我已经值八百块钱了。我巴不得能有这笔钱就好了，再多我也是不想要的。”

第九章


我要到小岛的当中去看一块地方，那是我不久前四处寻找时发现的。我们才动身没多久就到了那里，因为这个小岛只不过长三英里，宽四分之一英里罢了。

这块地方原是一道相当长的陡峭的山坡或是山脊，约莫有四十英尺高。我们挺吃力地爬了好久才到达顶上，因为山坡两侧很陡，灌木丛又很繁密。我们围着这个山顶来回翻越爬行，不久在岩石之间找着好大的一座山洞，洞口差不多就在山顶上，朝向伊利诺伊州那一边。这座山洞约莫有两三个房间连在一块儿那么大，吉姆可以挺直身子站在里面。山洞里头好凉快。吉姆觉得我们随身带来的东西应该马上都放在山洞里，但是我说，我们可犯不着整天价上上下下地老是爬山洞。

吉姆说，要是我们给小划子找着好地方藏起来，所有随身带来的东西全都放到山洞里，以后万一有人来到这个小岛上，我们就可以奔进山洞里去，只要他们不带狗，就永远也找不到我们。此外，他还说那些小鸟儿已向我们招呼快要下雨了，难道说我存心想要让那些随身带来的东西都给淋湿了吗？

于是，我们走回去找那只小划子，把它划到贴近山洞的地方，还把所有东西都扛上去，放到山洞里。随后，我们在附近踅摸到一块地方，把小划子藏在茂密的树林里。我们从钓线上取下来好几条鱼，再把钓线放回去，就开始准备做晚饭。

洞口大得很，一只大酒桶准能滚进去。洞口外一侧的地面往前稍微凸出一点儿，又很平坦，正是生火的好地方。所以，我们就在那里生火做饭。

我们把毯子铺在洞里，权且当作地毯，就在那里吃了晚饭。所有别的东西我们都放到洞里的后头取用方便的地方。不一会儿，天就黑下来，紧接着就是雷鸣电闪；那些小鸟儿的预告果然准极了。接着就下起雨来，是特大的暴雨，还刮起了我从来没见过的狂风。那是夏日里常有的一场暴风雨。天色骤然变黑，四下里一片乌青，显得分外好看；雨水铺天盖地袭来，连附近的树林子也都模模糊糊，像披着一层蜘蛛网似的；有时候一阵劲风，刮得树木东倒西歪，把灰白色的叶子底面都给翻上来；紧跟着一阵地动山摇的狂风，刮得树桠枝甩开胳膊乱舞，好像发了疯似的；接下来，正当天色最青最黑的时候，——唰！刹那间就像被天国的荣光照得透亮似的，你可以依稀看到远处——那是比你刚才看到的还要远出好几百码的地方——树梢儿正在暴风雨中前后颠簸；不过一眨眼又变成一片混沌，这时候，你就听到一声霹雳怪吓人地劈将下来，随后又从天际发出隆隆轰响，一溜歪斜地往地心深处滚下去，有如好几只空木桶，顺着长长的楼梯，欢蹦乱跳地往下滚，你知道。

“吉姆，这可真不赖呀，”我说，“我哪儿都不想去了，就爱在这儿待着。再递给我一大块鱼，另加一点儿热玉米面包。”

“得了，要不是我吉姆在这儿的话，你就不会上这儿来。你至今还在那边树林子里，没得饭吃，还差点儿给淹死了，那是不用说的，小乖乖。什么时候天下雨，连小鸡都知道，小鸟儿也知道，可你这个什么都不懂的小伢儿呀。”

河水不断上涨了十天或十二天，到最后把河岸都淹没了。小岛上一些低洼地和伊利诺伊河边低地上，水深都达到三四英尺。在这一边，河面已有好几英里宽了；但到密苏里州那一边，距离还是跟原来一样——即半英里路——因为密苏里州那边的河岸上，正有一道高耸的峭壁。

我们白天划着小划子在小岛上到处转悠。尽管外面的太阳像烈火似的炙烤着，在深林里却阴凉极了。我们常在树林子里迂回曲折地穿来穿去；有时候，低垂的藤蔓太密了，我们只好退回来，改走另一条路。每一棵枯朽的老树上，你都能看到兔子和蛇等那一类动物；小岛被淹没了一两天以后，它们因为饿得要命，都变得非常驯顺，你可以让小划子挨近到它们跟前，伸出手去抚摸它们，如果说你想这样做的话；但碰上蛇和鳖就不行——因为它们常常一刺溜蹿到水里去了。我们洞顶的山脊上，到处都是蛇和鳖。我们可以逮到很多很多小宠物，如果说我们想要的话。

有一天夜里，我们打捞起一小块木筏——都是优质松木板。它有十二英尺宽，约莫十五六英尺长，筏面高过水面有六七英寸，犹如一大块坚实、平滑的地板。白天我们常常看到锯好的木料漂浮过去，但我们也只好随它们漂浮过去；光天化日之下，我们是从不出来露面的。

又有一天夜里，恰好在天蒙蒙亮以前，我们来到了岛的顶端，看见从西边漂过来一座木板房。它是一幢两层楼，歪倒在水面上。我们冲着它划过去——从它楼上的一个窗子里爬了进去。不过那时候天还黑着哩，什么都看不出来，所以，我们就拴好小划子，坐在里头等天亮。

我们快要漂到小岛的末端了，这时天才开始有点儿亮光。我们就从窗子里往里看。我们这才看清楚一张床铺，一只桌子，两把旧椅子，地板上乱扔着的东西到处可见，墙上还挂着好几件衣服。离我们最远的角落里，有个什么东西正躺在那里，看过去好像是一个人似的。吉姆喊道：

“哈啰，你好！”

可它却依然纹丝不动。我又喊了一声，接下来吉姆就说：

“这个人不是在睡觉——他已经死了。你在这儿待着——我过去看一看再说。”

他走过去，弯下腰，瞅了一眼，说：

“原来是个死人呀。是的，千真万确。身上还一丝不挂呢。他的后背上挨过一枪。我估摸他死了已有两三天了。进来吧，哈克，可别看他的脸——太吓人了。”

我压根儿没有看他。吉姆扔过去几块破布头给他遮盖好了，其实他也用不着那么做；我压根儿不想去看他。地板上东一堆，西一簇，都是油汪汪的旧纸牌，好几个盛威士忌酒的旧瓶子，还有两个黑布做的假面具；四壁都是用木炭乱涂的最无聊的字和画。有两件肮脏的印花棉布旧褂子，一顶遮太阳的女帽，加上好几件女人内衣，全都挂在墙上；此外还有好些男人的衣服。我们把这许多东西都装上小划子，也许日后能派上一点儿用场。地板上有一顶男孩子戴的、缀满花斑的草帽，我也把它拿走了。还有一只盛过牛奶的空瓶子，连同一个碎布头做成的奶头状塞子，是给小娃娃吸奶时用的。这瓶子我们本也想要带走，但发现它已破裂了。有一只老掉牙的旧箱柜，一只呈现毛细裂纹的旧大衣箱，连同铰链全都坏了。这些箱柜都是敞开的，但里头什么有价值的东西也没有留下来。从满地狼藉这一点，我们可想而知，那些人准定是仓皇出逃，没法把他们的东西及时带走。

我们踅摸到一盏旧的洋铁皮提灯，还有一把无柄的杀猪刀，一把以其发明者巴洛的名字命名的单刃小折刀——这把刀不管在哪一家铺子里都值两毛钱；还有好多蜡烛，一只洋铁皮蜡烛台，一个葫芦瓢儿，一只洋铁皮杯子，一条破烂不堪的旧被子扔在床边，一只手提兜，里面装着针线、饰针、黄蜡、纽扣等这类东西，还有一把短柄小斧子和一些钉子，一条有如我小手指一般粗的钓鱼绳，那绳上拴着好几只怪可怕的大鱼钩；此外还有一卷鹿皮，一个皮制的狗项圈，一块马蹄铁，好几个没贴标签的小小药瓶子。我们正要离开的时候，我还踅摸到一把相当不错的马梳子，吉姆他踅摸到一把破旧的提琴弓和一条木质假腿。假腿上的皮带都断裂了，但是抛开这点不谈，它好歹还是一条顶呱呱的假腿，不过我嫌它太长一些，对吉姆来说却又嫌短些，我们尽管四处踅摸，也踅摸不着那另一条假腿。

所以，从各方面来说，我们可真是满载而归了。我们准备离去时，不知怎的漂到了小岛以南四分之一英里的地方，这时已经大天亮了；我就让吉姆躺在小划子里，用被子蒙住，他只要一坐起来，人们打老远一眼就看得出他是个黑人。我朝着毗连伊利诺伊州的河岸划过去，一边划，一边还顺水漂下去，约莫有半英里路。我沿着岸边死水[1]悄悄地往上划过去，没出什么岔子，也没碰见过什么人。我们终于平安无事地回来了。

第十章


早饭过后，我想要谈谈那个死人，猜测一下他是怎么给人杀害的，可是吉姆偏偏不乐意。他说谈死人会招来厄运；此外，他说那个死鬼说不定还会来缠住我们；他说，一个死后没被掩埋掉的人，比一个早已入土为安的死人更爱到处作祟。那些话听起来很有道理，所以我就不再多说了；但这件事我可不能不仔细琢磨琢磨，究竟是谁开枪打死他的，他们的意图又是什么呢。

我们把捡来的衣服仔细查看了一遍，发现有八块金币缝在一件旧毛皮大衣的里子里。吉姆说他认定那件大衣准是那座木板房里的人偷来的，因为他们倘若知道大衣里头有钱，断断乎不会把它扔在那里。我说我断定杀害这个人的也是他们；但是吉姆偏偏不乐意谈那个问题。于是，我就说：

“你觉得谈了那个问题就会招来厄运；但是我把前天在山顶上找到的那块蛇皮捡了回来，那你又该说些什么来着？你就会说我用手摸了一下蛇皮是天底下最要不得的厄运。得了，反正我们的厄运眼前已到啦！我们费劲搜拢来这么多的钱，另外还有八块钱。我真巴不得我们天天都能碰到这样的厄运呢，吉姆。”

“别扯了，小乖乖，你千万别扯了。你不要太高兴了。厄运转眼就要来了。记住我的话，厄运转眼就要来了。”

厄运果然又来到了。我们说话的那天是星期二。嘿，星期五晚饭吃完以后，我们正在山脊上的草地上躺着，发觉烟叶子都抽光了。我就回洞里去再取一些烟叶子来，不料发现里头有一条响尾蛇。我马上把它砸死了，但照样盘起来，就像鲜活的一模一样，藏到吉姆的毯子底下，想让他发现那里有蛇吓一跳，原本是拿他逗着玩儿罢了。到了夜里，我把逗蛇的事儿都给忘了。说来也巧，我正在点火的时候，吉姆刚侧身躺到毯子上，嘿，死蛇的配偶正在那儿，就冲着他咬了一口。

吉姆大声嚷嚷，一下子蹦了起来；亮光里只见那头恶蛇还在蠢动，打算再蹿上来咬人。我抡起一根树桠枝，立时把它打昏了，吉姆随手抓起老爸的威士忌酒壶就往恶蛇嘴里灌注。

这时吉姆光着脚丫子，那恶蛇正好咬着他的脚后跟。这可都得怪我傻得要死，竟然没记住以下这样的怪事：不管你把死蛇扔到哪儿，它的配偶准会过来盘绕在它周围。吉姆关照我先把蛇头砍下来扔掉，再把蛇皮剥掉，切下一块蛇肉烤一烤。我当然照办不误。他吃了蛇肉以后，说这可以帮他治伤。他还关照我把响尾蛇尾部的一些角质环取下来，再拴到他的手腕上。他说那也可防蛇咬。随后，我悄悄地溜了出去，把两条蛇都给扔到灌木丛里；因为我不打算让吉姆觉得那都是我的错，除非我出于无奈。

吉姆捧住酒壶喝了又喝，偶尔他喝得醉醺醺，就左右摇晃，大声嚷嚷；不过他每回醒过来，还会照样捧着酒壶再喝。他的脚肿得很厉害，连腿也都肿了。但是后来，这个醉鬼开始慢慢地走动了，所以我揣想他差不多快要好了；不过，我宁愿被蛇咬一口，也不喝老爸的威士忌酒。

吉姆躺倒了四天四夜。随后肿都消了，他又可以到各处走走了。我既然知道这种怪事的前因后果，就下决心再也不用手去摸蛇皮了。吉姆说他觉得下回我准会相信他的话。他说玩弄蛇皮能招致最可怕的厄运，也许我们这一回的厄运还没有完结呢。他说他宁愿从左肩膀一侧回头去看新月一千遍，也不愿用手捡一回蛇皮。我自己渐渐地也有那样的感受了，虽然我始终认为从左肩膀一侧回头去看新月，是人人都会干的最莽撞、最愚蠢的事情之一。从前老汉克·邦克干过一回，还自吹自擂过一番；殊不知两年不到，他喝醉了酒，从制弹塔顶上掉下来，摔得个稀巴烂，你会说就像一摊污泥似的；人们就用两扇谷仓门板合在一块，权当一口棺材，把他的尸体从门板缝里塞进去，随后把他掩埋掉；人们都是这样说的，可我并没亲眼看见。是老爸他说给我听的。但是不管怎样，反正都是傻乎乎地看月亮惹来的祸患呢。

日子一天天地过去了，河水照样在两岸之间顺流而下。我们干的头一件事，就是先剥掉一只兔子的皮，把兔子肉挂在一只大号钓鱼钩上作为鱼饵，然后投到河里去，逮了一条个儿跟人一般大的鲇鱼，有六英尺两英寸长，两百多磅重。当然，我们一时束手无策，怕它会把我们摔到伊利诺伊州那边去。我们只好坐在那里，眼看着它为了从钩上挣脱下来而猛力拼搏，直到最后给淹死了为止。我们从它肚子里发现一颗铜纽扣，一个圆球儿，还有许多烂糟糟的东西。我们一斧头劈开那个圆球儿，却见里头有一个线轴。吉姆说这条鱼把线轴吞进去已有好长时间了，因为那线轴外面已裹着那么多东西，最后形成了一个圆球儿似的实体。那是从密西西比河里逮到的一条特大的鱼，我暗自思忖道。吉姆说他从来没见过这么大的鱼。这条大鱼到了村子那里就能卖好价钱哩。人们会把它拿到市集上论磅零售；不管是谁都要买上好几磅；鱼肉白净得像白雪一样，炸熟了可好吃极了。

转天早上，我说现在日子过得太闷，乏味极了，真的要想个办法乐一乐。我说我恨不得偷偷地渡过河去，看看动静。这个点子吉姆倒是很喜欢；不过，他说我一定要趁着天黑去，特别小心留神。他仔细琢磨了一下，问我干吗不穿上那天捡来的一两件旧衣服，干脆扮成一个女孩子呢？这倒也是一个好点子。于是，我们把一件印花棉布褂子截短了，我让自己的裤腿往上捋到膝盖上，然后把截短了的褂子穿在身上。吉姆还用钓钩在我背后钩住这件褂子，因而看过去就显得非常合适。我头上戴着那顶遮太阳的女帽，还把带子系在下巴颏儿底下，于是有人打从帽子里侧看我的脸儿，就好像俯看一节火炉通烟管道一样。吉姆说谁都认不出我来，哪怕是在光天化日之下。为了掌握好这个诀窍，我装模作样地排练了一整天，没有多久我已装扮得很到家了，只是吉姆嫌我走起路来还不像女孩子；他说我必须改掉动不动撩起褂子掏摸裤兜的习惯。我注意改掉这毛病以后，也就更加乱真了。

天色刚黑下来，我就坐上小划子向伊利诺伊州那边的河岸进发。

我从渡船码头附近过河，朝小镇划过去，一股急流把我冲到了小镇的河边滩地上。我把小划子拴好了，就沿着河岸走去。在一个好久没人住的小棚屋里，有一盏灯亮着，我暗自纳闷到底是谁住在那里呢。我悄没声儿地走过去，从窗口往里仔细看：有个约莫年过四十的女人，借着一张松木桌子上的烛光正在结毛线。她的面孔我不认识；她是外来人，因为你在那个小镇上踅摸不到一副我不认识的面孔。这一下可算走运，因为我正拿不定主意；我来了以后却渐渐有点儿害怕；也许人家听得出我的声音，把我认出来。不过话又说回来，这个女人只要在这样的小镇上待过了两天，我想了解的事情，她准能都告诉我；所以，我就敲了一下门，心想可千万别忘了我是个女孩子。





第十一章


“进来。”那个女人说，于是我进去了。她说：“坐下吧。”

我就坐下了。她用她那闪亮的小眼睛，从头到脚打量着我，说：

“你叫什么名字？”

“萨拉·威廉斯。”

“你住在哪儿？就住在附近吗？”

“不，大妈。我住在霍克维尔，离这儿有七英里远。我是一路走来的，简直累得要命。”

“我看你肚子也饿了。我给你踅摸点儿吃的吧。”

“不，大妈，我肚子不饿。前一阵我肚子饿得够呛，只好在离这儿两英里的一个农场上歇歇脚，所以现在我不饿了。我那么晚才到达小镇上，原因就在这儿。我妈得了病，家里没有钱，什么也都没有，我这才跑来告诉我的舅舅阿布纳·穆尔。我妈说他住在这个小镇的上只角。可这儿我以前从没来过。不知道你认得他吗？”

“不认得。这儿的人我都还不认得。我住在这儿还不满两个星期。到小镇的上只角还远着呢。你最好就在我这儿过一宿，把帽子摘下来吧。”

“不，”我说，“我只想歇歇脚就走。我可不怕摸黑走。”

她说她不会让我独个儿走，她的丈夫也许只要一个半钟头就回来，她会打发他跟我一块儿上路。接着，她就扯起她的丈夫，又扯到她住在河上游的亲戚，还有住在河下游的亲戚。她说他们过去的生活过得多好，他们不在老家过好日子，偏偏搬到我们这个小镇上来，他们不知道这是不是失算了——如此等等，扯了好半天；直到后来，我才觉得自己来找她探听小镇上的消息，说不定倒是失算了吧。可是转眼间她话题一转，就扯到老爸和那起凶杀案上来，我也很乐意让她继续扯下去。她扯到我和汤姆·索亚怎样踅摸到那六千块钱[1]（只不过她把它说成了一万块钱）；有关老爸的一切她全都说了，她说他是个孬种，我也是个孬种，最后她还扯到我被杀害一事。我就说：

“是谁干的呢？我们在霍克维尔就听见很多这样的传闻，可我们不知道杀害哈克·费恩的究竟是谁。”

“哦，我觉得这儿也有不少人都想知道是谁把他杀害的。有人还认为是费恩老头儿亲自干的。”

“不见得吧——难道说真的是他干的吗？”

“开头几乎谁都是那么想的。他还一直蒙在鼓里，他差点儿被人动了私刑。不过还没等到夜里，他们的想法变了，认定那是一个名叫吉姆的在逃的黑奴干的事。”

“什么，他——”

我沉吟不语了。我想我还是缄口为好。她絮絮叨叨地说下去，压根儿就没有注意到我中间插话。

“那个黑奴恰好是在哈克·费恩被害的那天夜里逃跑的。所以当时就悬赏三百块钱——捉拿他。还有一项悬赏——两百块钱，是捉拿费恩老头儿的。你看，他在发生凶案的转天早上到小镇上来，一五一十地对人全说了，又跟他们一块儿上了渡船去找寻尸体，但后来他也就滑脚溜了。还没等到夜里，他们就想给他动私刑的，不过那时他早已跑掉了，你知道。得了，到了转天，他们才发现那个黑奴也跑掉了；他们发现他在发生凶案当天夜里十点钟以后就不见了。所以，他们才把赃都栽到他头上，你知道。可是，正在他们闹嚷得沸沸扬扬的时候，费恩老头儿转天却又跑回来了，哭哭啼啼地去找撒切尔法官要钱，说是到伊利诺伊州各地去寻找那个黑奴。法官给了他一些钱，当天晚上他就喝醉了酒，深更半夜还跟两个贼眉鼠眼的陌生人打得火热，后来竟跟他们一块儿远走了。打从那个时候起，他一直没有回来；人们都在猜想，除非这场风波稍微平息下去，他是不会回来的，因为现在有人认为既然是他杀害了自己的儿子，却故意弄虚作假，让人猜测是匪徒下了毒手；这么一来，他就可以拿到哈克的钱，再也用不着老是为了打官司而犯愁了。人们都说他人品不算太好，那等事他不见得干不出来。嘿，反正我说他真够狡猾的。他只要一年不回来，岂不是就没事了。你可抓不着他什么证据，你知道；到那时候，事态平息下去了，他不费吹灰之力就把哈克的钱拿到手。”

“是的，我也是这么想的，大妈。我可看不出还有别的什么问题。反正大家再也不怀疑是那个黑奴干的，可不是？”

“哦，不，还不是人人都那样想的。很多人觉得是他干的。反正他们很快就要逮住那个黑奴，也许能逼他招供出来。”

“怎么啦，他们还要逮他吗？”

“唉，你可真是头脑太简单！难道没见到那三百块钱天天搁在那儿让人随手去捡吗？有人估摸那个黑奴离这儿不会很远。我就是那么个想法——可我并没有到处去声张。前几天，我跟住在隔壁木板棚屋里的老两口闲扯，他们扯到那边有个什么叫作杰克逊岛，说差不离从来还没有人去过那儿。我就问，那个岛上有人住吗？他们回答说，没有人住。我就再也没有问下去，但我心里却一直在嘀咕。在出事前一两天，我看见那边——大概就在岛的顶端——一直在冒烟，这我敢肯定说准没错。于是我暗自琢磨：说不定那个黑奴就藏身在那个地方；所以，我就说，不管怎么样，值得费一点儿工夫，把那个地方搜索一下。不过后来我可再也没看见冒烟，所以我估摸他也许又跑掉了，如果说真的是他的话。但我的丈夫还是想去那里看一下——他是跟另外一个人一块儿去的。他已去河上游了；今天他才回来，两个钟头前他刚到家，我就跟他说过了。”

我听了以后心里烦躁，坐立不安。我的两只手也不知该做点儿什么才好。于是我从桌子上捡起一根针，想让一根线穿过去。不料我的手直哆嗦，老半天也穿不过去。那时，这个女人的话儿刚打住，我就抬起头来，只见她正好奇地瞅着我微微一笑。我放下针线，佯装对她所讲的感兴趣——其实我也真的感兴趣——就说：

“三百块钱，可真是好多钱呀。我真恨不得让我妈得了，该有多好。你的丈夫今天晚上就想过去吗？”

“哦，是的。他跟我刚才提到的那个人一块儿到小镇上踅摸船去了，还要看看他们能不能再借到一支枪。他们等到半夜以后就要动身过去啦。”

“他们要是等到天亮以后再过去，岂不是看得更清楚了吗？”

“是的，不错。但是那个黑奴不是也能看得更清楚了吗？过了半夜以后，他大概睡着了，他们可以在树林子里来回走动，在黑暗中更容易找到他的篝火，如果说他生了篝火的话。”

“那我可还没想到呢。”

这个女人总是好奇地直瞅着我，让我感到怪不舒服。不一会儿，她说：

“小乖乖，刚才你说你的名字叫什么呀？”

“玛——玛丽·威廉斯。”

不知怎的我总觉得刚才我说的名字，仿佛不是玛丽，所以我就不敢抬起头来；我觉得刚才我说的好像是萨拉；所以，我心里就觉得有点儿尴尬，深恐连我脸上也会表露出来。我真巴不得这个女人说的话再多一些；她越是坐着闷声不响，我越是觉得怪不自在。不料她却接下来说：

“小乖乖，我还觉得你开头进屋时说的是萨拉呢。”

“哦，是的，大妈，我是那么说过的。萨拉·玛丽·威廉斯。萨拉是我的教名。有人管我叫萨拉，也有人管我叫玛丽。”

“哦，原来就是这样的吗？”

“是的，大妈。”

那时候，我心里方才觉得舒坦一些；但不管怎样，我还是巴望离开这儿。我还是不敢抬起头来看她一眼。

这个女人谈着谈着，就谈起如今时世多么艰难，他们不得不过着多么贫苦的生活，还谈到耗子在这里多么逍遥自在地出没，赛过一家之主，如此等等，不一而足；于是我心里又觉得轻松了。她说耗子当家，的确没有错。每隔一会儿，你就会看见一只耗子从墙角窟窿里伸出它的鼻子须来。她说她独自一人待在屋里时，手边常要备好些东西，准备随时砸它们，要不然它们就让她整日价不得安宁。她拿给我看一个绞成一团的铅块，说她平日里就用它来砸耗子，真可以说百发百中，不过一两天以前，她把胳膊给扭了，不知道此刻砸起来还准不准了。但是她等了一个机会，对准一只耗子砸过去，因为偏离太远，没砸着，她嚷了一声：“哎哟哟！”反而让她的胳膊痛得要命。接着，她让我下一回也不妨亲自试一试。我本想不等到她丈夫回来就离开这里，当然，我还是不露声色。我捡起那个铅块，对准一只刚钻出鼻子须的耗子砸了过去，它要是躲在原处不动的话，恐怕早被砸得惨不忍睹了。她说我砸得好极了，她估摸，下一只耗子出来，我准能一砸就中。她走过去，把那个铅块捡了回来，还端过来一绞毛线，要我帮她一块儿绕成线团。我就举起两只手来，她把那绞毛线往我手上一套，就继续谈起她自己和她丈夫的一些事儿。但是不知怎的她突然住口，说：

“你可要盯住那些耗子。最好把这铅块搁在大腿上，拿起来方便些。”

就在说话这当儿，她把那铅块扔过来，我马上两腿一并拢接住了，她就继续往下谈。但是仅仅谈了一会儿。然后，她取走那绞毛线，两眼直瞅着我，乐呵呵地说：

“得了，你真正的名字——是叫什么？”

“什——什么，大妈？”

“你真正的名字叫什么？是比尔呢，是汤姆呢，还是博布[2]——还是别的什么来着？”

我想当时我像一片树叶子似的，浑身上下直哆嗦，简直不知道该怎么办才好。不过我还是说：

“请你别拿我这么一个可怜的小姑娘来逗乐吧，大妈。如果说我在这儿碍事的话，那我可以——”

“哪儿的话。你先坐下，还在原处坐好。我既不会伤害你，也不会去告发你。你尽管把你的秘密告诉我，而且还要信得过我。我会替你保密；顶要紧的是，我还会帮助你。我的老公也会帮助你，如果说你要他出力的话。听着，你准是个逃跑的学徒工——大不了就是这么回事。算不了什么。不要紧的。反正人家虐待你，你就下定决心逃跑呗。愿上帝保佑你，好孩子，我不会告发你的。现在你就全都告诉我吧——那才是个好孩子呀。”

于是，我说我再想佯装下去也不管用了，我愿意坦白，把自己的心事向她和盘托出，但是她万万不可说了话不算数。随后，我就告诉她说，我的爹娘都死了，治安官把我送给一个为人刻薄的老农民，他住在离河三十英里乡下，对我很坏，我可再也忍受不下去了。有一回，他出门去了，要过两三天才回来，所以我就趁此机会，偷了他闺女的一些旧衣服跑出来了。这三十英里地，我是在三个夜里走完的；我都是在夜里赶路，白天躲藏起来睡觉，我从家里带出来的那口袋面包和熟肉，足够我在路上吃用，到现在还剩下好多哩。我说我相信我的舅舅阿布纳·穆尔一定会照顾我，因此我就直奔这个戈申镇来了。

“戈申镇吗，孩子？这里可不是戈申镇。这是圣彼得堡。沿河往上还要走十英里才到戈申镇。是谁告诉你这是戈申镇呀？”

“哦，今儿个天刚蒙蒙亮，我正要到树林子里去，照例大白天睡觉，却碰见一个人，是他告诉我的。他跟我说，走到交叉路口往右一拐，再走五英里，就到戈申镇了。”

“料他肯定是喝醉了，我想。他对你说错了。”

“得了，看他的一举一动，倒是很像喝醉了，可是现在没得关系了。我该上路了。我打算在天亮以前赶到戈申镇。”

“再等一会儿。我想让你捎带一点儿吃食。也许你用得着吧。”

于是，她就给了我一点儿吃食，说：

“你听着——一头趴在地上的牛要站起来，头和尾哪一个先拱起来？马上回答我——不准你停下来仔细琢磨。到底是哪一个先拱起来？”

“尾部先拱起来，大妈。”

“那么，一匹马呢？”

“头部先拱起来，大妈。”

“青苔长在树干的哪一面？”

“北面。”

“如果说有十五头牛在山坡上吃草，里边有几头牛脑袋是冲着同一个方向的？”

“十五头牛全都冲着同一个方向，大妈。”

“敢情好，我想你确实是在乡下住过的。我估摸也许你又想要糊弄我呢。得了，请问你真正的名字是叫什么来着？”

“乔治·彼得斯，大妈。”

“得了，你可要千万记住，乔治。别忘了，你出门前跟我说你叫亚历山大，等你一出门被逮住的时候，又说你是叫乔治·亚历山大。还有，别再穿上这身印花棉布破褂子，到女人面前乱转悠了。你装扮小姑娘真的够蹩脚，但是你去骗骗男人，也许还行。我的天哪，孩子，你在穿针引线时，别连线头都拿捏不稳，硬是往针眼儿里乱戳；要把那根针拿捏得稳稳的，再让线头往针眼儿里穿过去——通常女人家都是这么个穿法；而须眉汉子总是适得其反。瞧你在砸耗子什么的时候，却踮起脚尖乱晃悠，还把手举过头顶，样子怪不雅观，让近在六七英尺的耗子都跑掉了。其实，你只要让手臂猛地一使劲甩出去，仿佛肩头里有个转轴似的——这才是小姑娘的姿势；千万别像男孩子让胳膊伸出一边，只凭腕肘的力气往外一甩了事。你还得记住，凡是小姑娘坐着时用衣裙兜住东西，通常两个膝盖都要分开，断断乎不像你刚才兜住铅块时让两个膝盖一块儿并拢。老实对你说，你在穿针时，我一眼就看出你原是一个男孩子了；接着，我又想出了别的一些花头来，不外乎要了解得更确切些。现在，你就去找你的舅舅吧，萨拉·玛丽·威廉斯·乔治·亚历山大·彼得斯。你要是碰上什么麻烦的事，就让人捎个话给朱迪·洛芙德斯太太，那就是我，我一定会尽力相助。沿着大河径直走下去就得了。下回出远门，鞋袜千万要带好。沿河都是石子路，谅你走到了戈申镇，你的两只脚丫子也就够呛了，我想。”

我沿着河岸往上游走了约莫有五十码，然后又原路折回，悄悄地溜到我停靠小划子的地方，那里离那座房子还很远。我跳上小划子，急匆匆划走了。我逆水划了很远才到了岛的顶端，然后开始划到对过去。我把遮阳大草帽摘了下来，因为这时候我用不着再戴这种遮脸的玩意儿了。我快要划到河心了，这时听见钟声响起来了；于是，我停下来仔细听着；钟声从水面上传过来，隐隐约约，但是十分清晰——十一点了。等我到了岛的顶端，已是气喘吁吁了。我来不及喘口气，直奔树林子里我原先生篝火的那个地方，在那里找着一块干燥的高地，生起了一堆旺篝火来。

随后，我跳上小划子，朝着大河以南一英里半的我们的落脚地使劲划过去。我上岸后，穿过树林子，爬上山脊，来到了洞里。吉姆躺倒在地上，正在呼呼大睡。我大声喊醒了他，说：

“吉姆，起来，快跑！一分钟也耽误不得。他们快追上我们了！”

吉姆什么都没有问，一句话也没有说；不过，从他随后忙活了半个钟头来看，他确实吓得要命。那时候，我们的全部家当都在木筏上了，我们准备从木筏所在地——柳树湾——把木筏给撑出去。我们先把洞口的那堆篝火熄灭掉，以后连一点儿蜡烛光都不让外露。

我把小划子划到离岸不远的地方，抬眼一看，附近即使有一条船我也看不见，因为在星光和树影里什么都看不真切。随后，我们便把木筏撑了出来，在树阴底下顺流而下，静悄悄地从岛的末端漂过去，一句话也都没说。

第十二章


我们最后来到小岛以南的时候，想必快到一点钟了，看来木筏走得太慢了。万一有船开过来，我们就要改乘小划子，逃向伊利诺伊州河岸那边；多亏没有船来，因为我们从来没想到把枪支，或者说，还有一根钓线、一点儿吃食都放在小划子上。当时，我们确实是火急万分，想不到那么多的事情。把样样东西都放到木筏上，这并不是上策。

如果说那些人到了岛上，我倒是巴不得他们发现我燃起的那一堆篝火，并且整夜守在那里，等吉姆回来。不管怎样，他们总算离我们远了，要是我燃起的篝火都骗不了他们，那就不算是我的错了。反正我也使用够卑劣的手法捉弄过他们了。

天边刚露出第一道曙光的时候，我就在毗连伊利诺伊州一侧大河湾里某个沙洲把木筏拴在岸边，用斧头砍下很多三角叶杨枝条，覆盖在木筏上，看过去岸上这块地方好像凹下去了。沙洲是一片拦门沙，上面长满了一丛丛三角叶杨，茂密得赛过耙子一样。

密苏里州河岸边有许多高山，伊利诺伊州一侧是茫茫大森林，这段航道恰好在那个地方侧向密苏里州岸边，所以我们并不害怕撞见什么人。我们在那里躺了一整天，看着木筏和汽轮沿着密苏里州河岸往下游疾逝而去，而那些开往上游的汽船却在河中央跟大河拼搏。我把我跟那个女人的闲扯，原原本本都告诉了吉姆。吉姆说她可真是个机灵鬼，他说，要是她自己来追赶我们，她可不会坐下来看那堆篝火的——不，她是断断乎不会的，伙计；料定她会带上一条狗。得了，我说，她干吗不会告诉她丈夫带上一条狗？吉姆说，他敢打赌，那两个男人临走时，她确实想到过的，他相信他们一定是到镇上踅摸狗去了，所以时间全给耽误了，要不然我们不会来到离村子十六七英里远的这个沙洲上——真的，绝不会的，我们还得重新回到那个老镇那里了。所以我说，只要他们没有追上我们就好，至于为什么没有追上，我才不管呢。

天色开始黑下来的时候，我们从三角叶杨丛林里探出头来，冲着大河上下游和河对岸张望了一会儿，什么都没有看见；于是，吉姆就从木筏顶层木板里头端起来好几块，搭建了一座怪舒适的小窝棚，赶上烈日炙烤或者大雨滂沱时，好歹有个遮蔽处，许多东西也不容易受潮了。吉姆还在小窝棚里铺上地板，使它高出木筏的表面一英尺多，所以现在汽轮冲过来的波浪，也不会把那些毯子和所有随身物品都给弄湿了。在小窝棚的正中央，我们铺上一层五六英寸厚的泥巴，四周还用框架围好，万一碰上刮风下雨或阴冷的天气，不妨就在这上头生火，因有小窝棚遮挡，外面也看不见火光。此外，我们还做了一把掌舵用的桨，因为原有的那些桨里头有一把遇上暗礁或别的障碍物时也许给砸断了。我们竖起一根矮矮的树桠杈，来挂那个破提灯；因为我们一看到下水的汽轮开过来，总得把提灯挂起来，免得被它撞翻了；可是我们用不着给上水的轮船挂提灯，除非我们发现自己处在人们所说的“横渡”之中，因为河水还是涨得很高，那些非常低的河岸仍然有点儿处在水底下；所以，上水的轮船不见得总是按照正常航道驶行，有时也会进入流速缓慢的水道。

转天夜里，我们已走了七八个钟头，这时流速每小时大约四英里以上。我们一边逮鱼，一边闲扯，为了不打盹儿，还不时跳下去游水。在静谧的大河上顺水而下地漂去，躺在木筏上面看星星，倒是真有一点儿神乎其神似的。这时，我们从来不会想到大声嚷嚷，哈哈大笑也很少，只是很难得轻声一笑罢了。那几天我们经常赶上特好的天气——头天夜里压根儿没事，接连两三夜也都没事。

每天夜里，我们少不得经过一些城镇，有的在遥远的黑苍苍的山坡上，抛开一片灯火，仿佛空无一物，连一所房子都看不见。第五天夜里，我们路过圣路易斯[1]，举目望去，那里好像是全世界都掌了灯似的。在圣彼得堡时，人们常说圣路易斯有两三万人口，但这话我从来都不相信，一直到了这个万籁俱寂的子夜里两点钟的时分，我看见了这一片神奇的灯海，方知这话不假。在那里，一点儿声音也没有，人们都已进入梦乡了。

现在每天夜晚，将近十点钟的时候，我照例要在某个小村子附近溜到岸上去，购买价值十美分或十五美分的玉米粉或是咸肉，或是别的吃食；有时候，我顺手偷了一只没进窝的小鸡捎回来。老爸常说，碰上好机会，顺手拿一只鸡也无妨，因为你要是自己不想要它，也不难找到很想要它的人，你做了好事，就会让人永远忘不了你。我从来没有见过有哪一回老爸自己不要鸡的，但是不管怎样，反正他动不动就说那样的话儿。

天亮以前，我经常悄悄地溜到玉米地里，去借一只西瓜，或是菜瓜，或是南瓜，或是几穗新嫩玉米，或是诸如此类的东西。老爸常说，借一些东西并不算什么的，只要你日后打算奉还的话；可是寡妇却说，那只不过是比偷偷摸摸稍微好听一些罢了，凡是正派人，断断乎不会做那等事。吉姆说，他认为寡妇说的有一部分道理，老爸说的也有一部分道理；所以，我们最好还是从中挑好两三件东西先借过来，接着说我们再也不想借了——这么一来，他认为以后再去借别的东西也就算不了什么。我们就这样来回拉扯了整整一宿，一边顺着水流往下漂去，一边要当机立断，究竟是扔掉西瓜呢，还是甜瓜，还是菜瓜，还是别的什么。不过快到天亮的时候，我们终于尽如人意地谈妥了，决定把沙果和柿子扔掉。在那以前，我们心中总觉得不对劲儿，可现在我们心情都舒畅了。其实，这个办法我也很赞成，沙果味儿不佳，柿子还得过两三个月才透熟。

有时候，我们用枪打中了一只清晨起得太早或是夜里睡得太晚的水鸟。总的说来，我们的日子过得挺痛快。

到第五天子夜以后，我们在圣路易斯以南碰上一场特大的暴风雨，当时雷电交加，大雨铺天盖地倾泻下来。我们躲在小窝棚里，任凭木筏随波逐流地往前漂去。在一道闪电的亮光里，我们能看到前面是一条笔直的滔滔大河，还有颤巍巍的岩崖竖立在大河的两旁。不一会儿，我大声喊道：“喂，吉姆，看那边呀！”那是一条触礁后沉没的小轮船。这时我们正朝着它漂浮过去。闪电把它照得非常清楚。它歪斜着倒向一边，顶层客舱的一部分露出水面，闪电迸发时，你连一根根紧紧固定船上大烟囱的粗铁丝都能看得一清二楚，大钟旁边有一把椅子，椅背上还挂着一顶旧阔边毡帽。

这时已到了深更半夜，在暴风雨里，周围一切都显得如此神秘，眼看着这条遇难船凄惨惨、孤零零地横在河的中央，我跟任何一个孩子都有同样的感受：我想要爬到轮船上去，偷偷摸摸地走一趟，看一看船上还有些什么玩意儿。所以，我就说：

“让我们上船去看一看吧，吉姆。”

偏巧吉姆一开头死也不让去。他说：

“我可不想到一条破船上去犯傻呢。现在我们好歹日子过得真不赖，我们还是不管它好了，就像圣书上所说的。那条破船上说不定还有人守夜呢。”

“什么你奶奶的守夜的！”我说，“除了最高甲板舱和领航室以外，还有什么好守夜的？在这漆黑一团的深夜里，这条破船随时都可能断裂成好几截，被河水冲走，你还认为有人肯为最高甲板舱和领航室守夜卖命吗？”吉姆一听我上面的反问，显然没话可说，所以他也并不打算再说什么了。“此外还有，”我说，“我们不妨从船长的特等客舱里去借一些用得着的东西来。雪茄烟，我敢打赌说准定有——而且每一支都是值五个美分、呱呱叫的现钞。轮船上当船长的，历来是有钱的，一个月有六十块美元进项，他们这些人只要想买哪一件东西，压根儿就不在乎耗钱该有多大，你知道。顺手拿一支蜡烛放在你的口袋里吧；要是我们不去船上搜抄一遍，我就睡不着觉，吉姆。你认为这样的事汤姆·索亚就会轻易放过吗？不是为了邪财，他才不会呢。他会把它说成是一次冒险——他准定是那么说的。就算是他最后的壮举，他也要登上那条破船。而且他一定还会耍花招——非得让自己露一手不可。得了，反正你会觉得那就跟克里斯托弗·哥伦布[2]发现天国一模一样。我真恨不得汤姆·索亚就在我们身边。”

吉姆虽然嘀咕了一两句，但后来还是让步了。他说我们不但要尽量少说话，即使说话，声音还要特别轻。闪电恰好又一次照亮了这条破船，我们走到船的右舷起重机摇臂吊杆的位置，把我们的木筏拴牢。

这里的甲板高高地耸起。我们悄悄地从甲板的斜面来到船的左舷，向最高甲板舱摸黑走去，我们一边用脚慢慢地踮起来，一边伸出手去触摸，别让船上那些缆索挡道，因为这时天色太黑了，我们连它们的影儿也都看不见。不一会儿，我们来到天窗前端，就爬了进去；下一步就到了船长室的门口，只见门敞开着，可是，哎哟哟，真没想到，我们发现最高甲板舱的过道尽头有一道亮光！就在同一秒钟里，我们好像还听见那边传过来的一阵很低的声音！

吉姆低声耳语说他真的一下子厥倒了，让我跟他一块儿走。我说，好吧，就准备回木筏去；不料就在这时，我听见有一个声音呜咽着说：

“哦，请千万要手下留情，哥儿们，我发誓决不说出去就得了！”

另一个相当高亢的声音说：

“吉姆·特纳，你这是撒谎。从前你就来过这么一套的。历来分东西时，你总想拿了你应得的一份以外，再多拿一点儿，而且哪回你都多拿了，因为你老是发誓说，反正只要你不说出去就得了。不过这一回你就算说了也不管用。你就是国内最无耻、最险恶的癞皮狗。”

这时候，吉姆已经到木筏那边去了。我感到特别好奇；我暗自琢磨，要是汤姆·索亚他绝不会后退的，所以我也绝不能回头就走；我可打算看一看这里到底出了什么事。我就在那条窄小的过道里跪下去，用双手和膝盖摸着黑向船尾爬过去，直到后来，在我和最高甲板舱的横道之间，差不离只有一个高级客舱了。就在这里，我看见有一个人直挺挺地躺在地板上，手脚都给捆绑住了，另有两个人站在旁边，两眼俯看着他，一个人手里拎着提灯。灯光很暗，另一个人握着一支手枪。这个人一刻不离地用手枪指着地板上那个人的脑袋，说：

“我倒是很想——而且我也是应该——你这个死不要脸的家伙！”

躺在地板上的那个人一下子浑身萎缩，说：“哦，千万手下留情呀，比尔——我一辈子都不会说出去呀。”

每一回他这样说，拎着提灯的那个人就大笑一声，说：

“你确实不会说吗？你从来没说过比这更真实的话，是不是？”有一回，他说：“听他的什么求告不求告！要是我们没有把他压倒、捆绑起来的话，他早就把我们两个都给宰了。那么，为的是什么呢？什么都没有。无非就是因为我们都坚持自己应得的权利——原因出在这里。可是，吉姆·特纳，我敢打赌你再也吓唬不了谁。把手枪收起来，比尔。”

比尔说：

“不，贾克·帕卡德。我可一定要毙了他——他还不是照样把老哈菲德也给毙了吗——难道说这不就是对他的报应吗？”

“可是我并不想要他死，因为我也有我的道理。”

“愿老天爷保佑你这个开了金口的人，贾克·帕卡德！我一辈子都忘不了你的恩情啊！”躺在地板上的那个人有点儿啜泣着说。

贾克·帕卡德并没有注意到这些话，只是把提灯挂到一个钉子上，朝着我所在的暗头里走了过来，而且还示意比尔也一块儿过来。我趴在地上尽快往后退去约莫有两码光景，但因船体过度倾斜，我早已断了后路；为了不让他从我身上踩过去，把我逮住，我就爬到船身翘起的那边一个高级客舱里去了。那个人在暗头里乱抓乱摸地走过来，等到帕卡德走进我那个客舱时，他就说：

“在这儿——快上这儿来。”

他进来了，比尔也跟他一块儿进来了。但是他们还没进来以前，我早就爬到了上铺，我已被逼入困境，后悔自己真不该进来。他们伫立在那里，用手搭在卧铺床沿交谈。我看不见他们，但从他们身上散发那种令人呛鼻的威士忌酒味，我说得出他们站立在哪里。幸好我没有喝威士忌酒；可是不管怎样，即使喝了也没有多大关系，因为他们还不会爬上来抓我，又因为我始终尽量屏住不喘气。说实话，我是吓得要死了。再说，一个人想要倾听类似这样的交谈，压根儿就不能喘出气来。他们交谈时声音既低而又坚定。比尔想要把特纳置于死地。他说：

“他说他不会说出去的，赶明儿他一定照说不误。我们已跟他吵过嘴，又是这么给他颜色看的，现在就算我们这两份都给了他，那也不会起什么作用。他肯定作为检举我们的证人，供出对我们不利的证据来；现在你就听我的话吧。我主张还不如干脆把他干掉算了。”

“我也是这么想的。”帕卡德泰然自若地说。

“该死的，我开头还有点儿认为你可不是这么想的。那么，得了，我们就下手吧。”

“且慢，我话还没说完呢。你听我说，枪毙的办法固然很好，但如果说势在必行的话，那一定还有其他闷声不响的好办法。我的意思是这样的：要是有某个好办法既能达到同样目的，而又不冒任何风险的话，那么，上法庭被处以绞刑，可不是好主意啦。你说是不是？”

“是的，你说得不错。不过这一回你打算怎么办呢？”

“听着，我的主意是这样的：我们就加劲干，把各个高级客舱里忘了拿走的东西都收拢来，搬上岸去藏起来。随后，我们就只好干等着。现在我说要不了两个钟头，这条破船就会断裂成几截，顺水冲走。你明白了吗？他会给淹死的，他可不能怪谁，只好怪他自个儿了。我看这种高见要比杀害他更胜一筹。只要你有别的办法可想，我是不赞成杀人的；那可不是个好主意，那是缺德透顶的事。你说是不是？”

“是啊——我觉得你说得有理。但是，万一破船不断裂，也不被河水冲走，那该怎么办呢？”

“反正我们还能等两个钟头再说，不好吗？”

“那也好，我们这就走吧。”

于是他们走了，我就溜了出来，浑身上下冒冷汗，还得往前爬过去。那儿是漆黑一团，这时我话音有点儿沙哑，只好轻声喊道：“吉姆！”不料他恰好就在我的胳膊肘旁边，好像有点儿呜咽似的应答了一声。于是，我就说：

“快点儿呀，吉姆，眼下不是到处闲逛、呜呜咽咽的时候了；那边有一帮子杀人犯，要是我们找不着他们的船，把它顺河水漂下去，让他们离不开这条破船，那么，他们这帮子里头就会有一个人倒霉。但是，如果我们找到了他们的船，那么，他们那一帮子人，个个都会倒霉——因为治安官就会逮住他们。快点儿——赶快呀！我顺着左舷找，你顺着右舷找。你先从木筏开始，而且——”

“哎哟哟，我的天哪，我的天！木筏呢？连它的一点影儿也没有了。它的缆索一断裂，给河水冲走了！——可我们都在这儿跑不了！”

第十三章


我吓得突然停止了呼吸，几乎昏迷了过去。跟这么一帮子人被困在一条破船上！这可不是乱发牢骚的时候。现在我们势必要去找他们那条小船——找到了就给我们自己用。于是，我们浑身哆哆嗦嗦地打从右舷走过去，走得很慢，好像挨过一个星期才来到了船尾。连小船的一点影儿都没有。吉姆说他不信他还能向前再走出一步了——他说他已吓得要命，几乎一点儿力气也没有了。但是我说，向前走吧，我们要是在这条破船上不走，准定要倒霉。于是，我们继续向前潜行。我们直奔最高甲板舱的后尾，随后顺着天窗，从一扇百叶窗攀悬到另一扇百叶窗，径直向前摸索过去，因为这时天窗的边沿已经沉入水中。我们快要走到横道口时，才发现那条小船就在那儿，准没错！我刚好看得见它。我可要谢天谢地了。本来我一下子就会跳到小船上去，偏巧这会儿那道门打开了。有一个人探出头来，离我才不过两英尺左右，我以为自己这下子可完了，不料此人又猛地把头缩了回去，说：

“比尔，把那该死的提灯扔到一边去！”

他把一口袋东西扔到小船上，随后自己上了船，接着坐下来了。这个人正是帕卡德。随后，比尔也出来，上了小船。帕卡德悄没声儿地说：

“一切都齐备了——撑开吧！”

我在百叶窗上几乎攀悬不住了，我浑身上下一点儿力气都没有了。可是比尔说：

“等一下——你搜抄过他身上了吗？”

“没有。你没有搜抄过他吗？”

“没有。那么，他的那一份现钞还在他身上呢。”

“那得了，过来吧——把东西带走了，反而把钱留下，那可要不得。”

“嘿——那他不会怀疑我们想要干什么呀？”

“也许他不见得吧。可是不管怎样，反正我们总得把钱给找回来。一块儿走吧。”

于是，他们从小船里出来，又走到客舱里去了。

砰的一声门关上了，因为它是在破船歪歪斜斜地倾覆着的那一边；刹那间，我就到了这条小船上，吉姆也踉踉跄跄地跟着我过来了。我掏出小刀来，把缆绳割断，我们就开船远走了。

我们连桨把都没碰摸，我们一句话都不说，低声耳语也没有，甚至连呼吸差不多都快要停住了。我们飞也似的往前滑行，在死沉沉的寂静中，打从明轮罩的尖顶和船尾擦过去；再过了一两秒钟以后，我们已漂浮到破船以南一百码的地方，这时黑暗把它全给遮没，连它的一点儿影子都不见了。我们方才知道：我们已经脱离了危险。

我们漂浮到大河以南三四百码的地方，看见那个提灯像小小一点儿火星似的展露在最高甲板舱的门口，直到这时我们才知道那两个流氓踅摸不到他们的小船，已开始领悟到：他们自己此刻如同吉姆·特纳一样，也是死路一条了。

于是，吉姆操起桨来，我们开始寻找我们的木筏。现在，我才头一次开始替那拨人犯愁——我想刚才我是没有时间顾念到他们。我开始揣摸：逼入这样一种绝境，哪怕是杀人犯，也是怪害怕的。我暗自寻思，说不定我自己多咱也会变成杀人犯，到那时我难道心里还会高兴吗？于是，我就跟吉姆说：

“我们只要一看到灯光，就在它的上游或下游一百码的地方靠岸，找块地方把你和小船都藏起来，然后我胡编乱诌一通，让来人去找寻那个强盗帮，先把他们救出绝境，接下来他们只要大限一到，分明会被处以绞刑。”

可是这个点子却泡汤了，因为没多久大风大雨转眼间又来了，而且比哪一回都要猛烈。暴雨倾泻下来，一点儿灯光也见不到；我想，这时凡是在家的人都已经安睡了。我们却顺着大河径直往南冲去，一边留神看着有没有灯光，一边在踅摸我们的木筏。过了好长时间，雨停住了，可是雨云残留在天际，雷响依然隐约可闻。没多久，一道闪电，让我们看见一团黑糊糊的东西在我们前方漂浮，于是，我们就冲着它划过去。

那正巧就是我们的木筏，我们终于又回到了木筏上，真是喜出望外。这时，我们看见了一点儿灯光，远远地在河以南靠右边的岸上。于是，我说我就要去踅摸它。这条小船里所装载的半船赃物，都是那个强盗帮从破船上抢来的。我们连忙把这批赃物乱码在木筏上，我关照吉姆顺着河水漂下去，等他估计自己漂了大约两英里时，就亮起灯来让我看，一直亮到我来到时为止；随后，我就操起桨来，朝着灯光奋力划去。一路上我又看见三四点灯光——是在一座小山坡上。原来是一个村子。我尽量向那岸上的灯光靠近，把桨搁下漂过去。我打从那儿经过时，看见那是盏灯挂在一条双壳渡船的旗杆上。我很快地绕着渡船转了一圈，想找那个看船的人，我暗自纳闷，真不知道他到底睡在哪儿；不一会儿，我发现他正在系缆柱上睡觉，脑袋耷拉在两膝之间。我在他的肩膀上轻轻地拍了两三下后，不由得失声大哭起来了。

他仿佛有点儿吃惊似的身子欠了一下；他一看到眼前只不过是我罢了，就打了一个哈欠，伸了伸懒腰，说：

“哈啰，是怎么回事呀！别哭，小东西。有什么伤心事呀？”

我说：

“爸爸，妈妈，姐姐，还有——”

随后，我实在按捺不住了。他就说：

“嘿，真该死，得了，别这么伤心，反正人人都有伤心事，好在你这事也总会过去的。他们究竟是怎么啦？”

“他们——他们——你就是看船的吗？”

“是啊，不错。”他说，好像有点儿得意扬扬的样子。“我的名分可多着哩，我又是船长，又是船主，又是大副，又是领航，又是看船的，又是水手领班；有的时候，我还可以权且充当客货哩。我可不像老吉姆·杭贝克那么有钱，我对待汤姆、迪克、哈里也就不能那么阔气大方得要死，更不能像他那样一掷千金。可是，我已经跟他说了不止一回，我压根儿不愿和他调换职位，因为我说我命里注定，要当上一辈子水手。我要是住在小镇外两英里的地方，那我可就完了，因为在那乡下什么玩意儿都没有，即使把他所有的钱财，另外再加上许多全给了我也不行。我说——”

我插嘴说：

“他们碰到了许多麻烦，而且——”

“究竟是谁呀？”

“哦，爸爸，妈妈，姐姐，还有胡克小姐；要是你乐意把渡船开到那边去——”

“开到哪边去？他们是在哪儿呀？”

“在那条破船上。”

“什么破船呀？”

“怎么啦，不是只有那么一条破船吗？”

“什么，难道你指的是‘华尔特·司各特’[1]号吗？”

“是的。”

“哎哟哟，天哪！他们上那儿干什么呀？”

“得了，他们可不是故意上去的。”

“我敢说他们不是故意的！可是，我的天哪，他们不赶快离船，可就没得命了！那么，他们又怎么会陷入这么一种绝境呢？”

“这个并不难。胡克小姐从河上游出发，去小镇上访友——”

“是的，布思渡口——再往下谈吧。”

“她是访友去的，到了布思渡口那里，刚巧天快要黑下来，她跟她的黑人女仆坐在运马匹的大渡船上过河，准备到她的朋友家里去过一夜。她的朋友是叫什么什么小姐——我可把她的芳名给忘了——她们不知怎的把掌舵的桨给弄丢了，渡船马上掉过头来，船尾朝前，往下漂浮了两英里光景，却被那条破船撞翻了，围着它打转转。那个船夫和黑人女仆，还有好几匹马全都冲走了，可是胡克小姐一把抓住了破船，就爬上去了。天黑之后约莫个把钟头，我们坐着我们做买卖的平底驳船打从河上游开过来，那时天色已经很黑，那条破船我们直到正面撞上了方才发觉，所以嘛，我们的平底驳船也给撞翻了，围着它打转转；不过，我们大家好歹都没淹死，抛开比尔·惠普尔一个人——啊，他确实是天底下最了不起的好人！——怎么淹死的偏偏是他呢，我真恨不得是我自己才好呀。”

“哎哟哟，这事可真惨，我还从没碰见过。那后来你们大家又怎么啦？”

“我们大声嚷嚷，大哭大叫，喊救命，不料那儿河面太开阔了，我们尽管乱叫乱嚷得震天响，反正谁也听不见。所以老爸就说，不管怎样，总得先派人上岸去找人来救援才好。那时只有我一个人会游水，于是，我就自告奋勇，上岸找人来了。胡克小姐说，我如果一时踅摸不到人来救援，不妨就至此地来找她舅舅，他老人家总有办法的。我就在大河下游约莫一英里的地方上了岸，一个劲儿求人家出出点子，可是人家都说：‘什么呀，在这样的深更半夜，河水又是这么急，那不是发疯了吗？快点去找那条轮渡吧。’现在，如果你乐意去的话，而且——”

“说实话，我倒是乐意去，我要是不乐意去，那才该死。可是，有谁来付我辛苦钱呢？你觉得你老爸——”

“嘿，一句话，那个可好办。胡克小姐她特别关照过我，说她的舅舅吉姆·杭贝克——”

“哎哟哟，我的老天哪！原来他是她的舅舅呀？你听我说，你冲着那边的灯光走过去，到了那里往西一拐，大约再走四五百码，来到一家小酒店，你就要他们赶紧领你到吉姆·杭贝克府上，他准会付钱的。现在，你可不要再到处乱走了，因为他准定想要知道这个消息。转告他老人家，他还没有赶到镇上，我早已把他的外甥女小姐平安无事地给救出来了。得了，你就快快去吧。我马上去这边街角，把我船上的轮机员叫醒。”

我冲着灯光走了过去，但等他刚拐过街角，我就回头走，来到了我的小船上，把船里的积水舀出去，随后在约莫有六百码之遥的缓缓的水流里靠了岸，藏身在好几条运木船中间；因为我不看到这条轮渡开走就安不下心来，总的说来，我虽然为了那伙强盗招来了那么多麻烦，但是心里倒也觉得很坦然，因为肯这样做的人绝不会很多的。这件事我真巴不得寡妇也知道才好。我估摸她会为我帮助过这拨无赖汉而自豪，因为无赖汉和二流子正是寡妇和善男信女们最感兴趣的一类人。

没有多久，那条破船就过来了，黑糊糊地顺水而下！我浑身上下不觉打了个冷战，随后我就冲着它开过去。它扎在水里非常深，我一眼看出船上即使有人，也决无生还的机会。我围着它划了一遭，还高喊了两三声，可是没有人应答；四下里死沉沉的静寂。我想起了那伙强盗，心里不觉有点儿沉重，可也并不怎么的，因为我估摸，如果说他们能受得了，那我也行。

后来，那条大渡船也开过来了；所以，我就让小船划行很长一段路，顺流斜穿过去，才到达了大河的当中。我估摸着反正人家都看不见我了，这时我就把桨搁下，回过头来往后面一看，只见那条大渡船紧挨着破船来回转，为了要找到胡克小姐的遗骸，因为这位船长知道她的舅舅吉姆·杭贝克准定要它的。殊不知没有多久，这条大渡船也只好放弃不找了，朝着河岸开回去了；我就全力以赴，飞也似的顺着河水冲下去。

看来挨过了老长老长的时间，吉姆的灯光才露出来；而且它一露出来，这时望过去好像是远在一千英里以外似的。当我到达他那里的时候，东头的天边已开始有一点儿鱼肚白了；于是，我们就朝着一座小岛奋力划过去，先把木筏隐藏好，再把小船沉没了，随即钻进小窝棚，酣睡得像死人一般。

[1]华尔特·司各特（1771—1832）：英国著名诗人、小说家，浪漫主义时代极为流行的西欧历史小说的奠基人，他的创作里已显示了现实主义倾向的萌芽。但据美国评论家考证，马克·吐温在《密西西比河上》一书中曾指控《艾凡赫》（旧译《撒克逊劫后英雄传略》）及“华尔特爵士病症”实际上是美国内战的起因。《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》成书之时，正值美国文学现实主义运动达到高峰，马克·吐温却希望司各特与库珀的历史小说，就像这一艘破沉船，或像是哈克贝利在岸上所见所闻的南北战争以前的文化一样永远沉没了。





第十四章


没有多久，我们起来了，就把那伙强盗从破船上抢来的赃物翻看了一遍，找着一些靴子、毯子、衣服，和其他各种物品，还有许多书，一只小型望远镜，三盒雪茄烟。我们两个人有生以来，谁都还没有这么富有过。这些雪茄烟，味道真是好极了。整个下午我们都在树林子里闲聊天，我还看看那些书，不消说，其乐无穷。我还把破船里和大渡船上所见所闻全都讲给吉姆听；我说这类事就叫作历险；可是他说他再也不想去历险了。他说当时我爬进最高甲板舱，他爬回去找木筏，却发现木筏连影儿都没了，那时候他差点儿没急死呢，因为他暗自琢磨，不管结局如何，反正他自己可完了：因为如果说没有人来救他，他就会给淹死了；如果说有人来救他，那么，不管救他的是谁，都会押送他回家，就好去领赏，随后，沃森小姐肯定把他卖到南方去。是的，他想得很对头；他想的差不多总是对头的；就一个黑人来说，他的头脑确实是非同一般了。

我给吉姆说起了很多有关国王、公爵、伯爵等等的故事，还说到他们穿着多么华丽，派头该有多大，他们相互之间称呼什么陛下呀，阁下呀，大人呀等等，压根儿不称什么什么先生的；吉姆鼓起两只大眼睛，听得津津有味。他说：

“我还不知道有这么多头儿呢。除了老所乐氓王[1]以外，我几乎还没听说过别的国王，除非你把纸牌里头的王牌都算是国王就得了。那么，请问一个国王挣多少钱呀？”

“挣多少钱？”我说，“嘿，一个月想要一千块钱，就有一千块钱；他们想要多少就有多少；反正什么东西都属于他们的。”

“那还不会乐死了吗？哈克，你说，他们都干啥去了？”

“他们啥都不干！你干吗说这样的蠢话。他们只会待着打坐呗。”

“不见得吧——难道说那是真的吗？”

“当然是真的。他们只会待着打坐。打仗的时候也许是例外；那时候他们就得上战场。可是在平时，他们净是游手好闲地待着；或者是牵着鹰去打打猎——只是牵着鹰——嘘！——你听是什么响声？”

我们蹦蹦跳跳地走了出来，举目四望，大不了是从远处绕过岬角开过来一条汽轮的轮子的击水声；所以，我们也就回去了。

“是呀，”我说，“平日里他们闲得无聊极了，就跟国会胡搅蛮缠[2]；要是有人不听话，就砍他的脑袋。不过话又说回来，他们一天到晚几乎都待在后宫里。”

“待在什么地方呀？”

“后宫。”

“什么叫后宫来着？”

“那是他那一帮子老婆所住的地方。你连后宫都不知道吗？所罗门就有一个‘后宫’，他差不离有一百万个老婆[3]哩。”

“哦，得了，原来是这么回事；我——我可把它给忘了。我估摸后宫是个管吃管住的寄宿舍。儿童室里大概吵得最闹猛。依我看，他的那些老婆准得整天价吵嘴，不用说更闹猛啦。偏偏人家都说所乐氓是开天辟地以来最聪明的人。可是我才不信那一套。为什么呢：一个聪明人怎会从早到晚净泡在那么个天知道该死的地方？不——他才不会呢：一个聪明人就会盖个锅炉厂，反正什么时候他想要歇着，干脆把这锅炉厂关门就得了。”

“得了，不管怎么说，反正他总是个最聪明的人，因为寡妇亲口对我这么说的。”

“我才不管寡妇是怎么说的，反正他绝不是个聪明人。他出过好些个鬼主意，我可从来还没见过。你知道不知道他要把一个孩子劈成两半的故事吗[4]?”

“我知道，那寡妇全都给我说过了。”

“敢情好！那还不是世界上最荒唐透顶的坏点子吗？你把这件事拿过来看一看就得了。那边有一个树桩，就算是一个女人吧；你在这儿——充当另一个女人；我是所乐氓，这张一块头的钞票就算是那个孩子。你们两个都说这张钞票是自己的。那我可该怎么办呢？难道说我不应该到左邻右舍去，查问清楚这张钞票到底是谁的，然后原封不动地交还给本人吗？凡是稍微乖觉一点儿的人都是这么做的。可是不——我把钞票一接过来，就撕成两半，一半交给你，另一半交给那个女人。那就是照抄所乐氓处置那个婴孩的办法。现在，我倒要问问你：那半张一块头钞票有什么用呢？——什么东西也买不来。那半个孩子又有什么用呢？就算给一百万个，我也不要。”

“吉姆，你全给理解错了——真该死，你简直是大错特错了。”

“你说谁呀？是说我吗？去你的吧。别跟我说你的那些大道理了。我认为，凡是我看得懂的，就是有道理的；像刚才所说的那种办法，压根儿就没有道理。这儿发生的争执，并不是半个孩子，而是一整个孩子；如果有谁以为他能用半个孩子来解决一整个孩子的争执，那他就是一个下雨天还不知道快进屋躲一躲的大笨蛋。哈克，你别再跟我谈那个所乐氓了，我早就把他看透了。”

“可是我跟你说，你压根儿没弄懂大道理呗。”

“什么该死的大道理！我认为凡是我懂得的事，我都懂得的。你要知道，真正的大道理还得往深处看——直到它深深的根基。要看所乐氓是有什么样的身世。比方说，有一个人，他只有一两个孩子；试问这个人会拿着自己的孩子白白糟蹋掉吗？不，他断断乎不会；他压根儿舍不得呢？他知道捧着自己的孩子当宝贝。可是，你再举出另一个人来，他有大约五百万个孩子，在家里乱蹦乱跳的，那可就不同了。他二话没说，会把一个孩子劈成两半，就像劈一只猫似的。反正他家里孩子还多着呢。对所乐氓来说，一个或两个孩子，多也好，少也好，都算不了什么。老天爷会惩罚他！”

我从来还没见过这样的黑人。他的脑瓜里只要有过一个什么想法，那就再也没法把它消除掉。在我所见过的黑人里头，他是最痛恨所罗门的一个。所以，我就跟他谈其他一些国王，把所罗门先撇在一边不谈。我跟他谈到很久以前法国的路易十六[5]怎样被人砍掉脑袋的；还谈到了他的小儿子，也就是那个皇太子[6]，他本该当皇上的，可是也被抓起来，锒铛入狱，有人说他就死在监牢里。

“怪可怜的小东西。”

“不过有人说他越狱后逃到美国来了。”

“那敢情好！可是他会不会憋闷得发慌——我们这儿国王是没有的，还是说有，哈克？”

“没有。”

“那时怕他找不到事由吧。他还会打算干什么呢？”

“那我可不知道。他们里头有些人就去当警察，也有些人教别人讲法国话。”

“怎么啦，哈克，法国人说话跟我们不一样吗？”

“不一样，吉姆；他们说的话，你一点儿听不懂——连一个字儿也都听不懂。”

“哦，真是该死！那是怎么回事呢？”

“我也不知道，不过的确是这样。我从一本书里学了他们几句叽里咕噜的怪话。比方说，有个人走过来，跟你说：‘爸来——乎——勿浪在，[7]——那你会觉得怎么样？”

“我不觉得怎么样呗。我就抓住他，先把他的脑袋给砸了。这就是说，只要他不是白人的话。我可不准一个黑人那么招呼我。”

“呸，人家并不是招呼你呀。只不过是问问你会不会说法国话罢了。”

“那他干吗不说清楚呢？”

“他是说清楚了。法国人说话就是那么个腔调。”

“那怪腔怪调可真逗死人了，我再也不想听那种鬼话了。压根儿是胡说八道。”

“我问你，吉姆，猫咪说话跟我们一样吗？”

“不，猫咪说话跟我们不一样。”

“得了，那么，母牛呢？”

“不，母牛说话也不一样。”

“猫咪说话跟母牛一样呢，还是母牛说话跟猫咪一样？”

“不，它们都不一样。”

“它们说话都不一样，是天然合理的事，可不是吗？”

“那当然咯，还用得着问吗？”

“那么，猫咪和母牛说话跟我们不一样，不也是天然合理的事吗？”

“那当然是一点儿也不错。”

“那么，得了，一个法国人说的话跟我们不一样，干吗就不是天然合理的事呢？你给我回答那个问题吧。”

“猫咪是人吗，哈克？”

“不是。”

“那么，得了，猫咪要是说话跟人一样，那准是胡说八道。母牛是人吗？或者说母牛就是猫咪吗？”

“它既不是人，也不是猫咪。”

“那么，得了，它既不是人，又不是猫咪，它就用不着说话跟人或是猫咪一样，请问一个法国人是不是人？”

“当然咯，是人。”

“那就得了！真该死，他干吗说话不跟人们一样呢？你给我回答那个问题吧！”

我知道跟他再费口舌一点儿都没意思——你压根儿没法跟一个黑人抬杠。所以，我就只好就此打住了。

[1]此处应为所罗门王，吉姆错念为“所乐氓”。所罗门是古以色列大卫王之子，是公元前10世纪中叶最伟大的以色列国王，以智慧、贤明著称。他还写过一千多首诗歌，其中主要是《圣经》中所收的《雅歌》。

[2]作者在此处暗指英王查理一世（1600—1649），曾为英国斯图亚特王朝国王（1625—1649），因对抗国会，压迫清教徒，引起内战，战败后作为“暴君、叛徒、杀人犯和国家的公敌”被国会判处死刑。

[3]详见《圣经·旧约全书·列王纪》上卷第11章第3节：“所罗门有妃七百，都是公主，还有嫔三百。这些嫔妃诱惑他的心。”哈克在这儿胡说所罗门差不多有一百万个老婆。

[4]详见《圣经·旧约全书·列王纪》上卷第3章第16节至第28节。所罗门以智断案，大意如下：有两个女人争夺一个婴儿，都说婴儿是自己所生，各执一词。所罗门命人将婴儿一分为二，以两个女人的反应判断究竟谁是真正的母亲。婴儿的生母请求他不要杀死孩子，把孩子判给另一个女人，而那个冒充的母亲则同意了所罗门的做法。

[5]路易十六（1754—1793）：法国大革命前封建王朝的末代君主，1774年—1792年在位。1792年8月2日君主制被推翻，9月21日法兰西第一共和国成立。1793年1月18日，国民公会以叛国罪判处他死刑，21日路易十六在巴黎革命广场被送上了断头台。

[6]路易-查理（1785—1795）：法国皇太子，路易十六的次子。路易十六被送上断头台时，他才八岁。1793年成为法国挂名国王，称为路易十七。1792年君主制被推翻后，他和王室其他成员被关入巴黎丹普尔监狱，1795年死于狱中。也有人说他没有死，而是逃出了丹普尔监狱，逃到了美国或其他地方。在此后的几十年中，有三十多人自称为路易十七，但均证据不足。马克·吐温当时手头也有一本有关路易-查理的书，作者名叫霍勒斯·富勒。

[7]此处即指parlez-vous Francais（法语），意谓：“你会说法语吗？”





第十五章


我们估摸着再过了三夜就要到伊利诺伊州南端的开罗[1]，俄亥俄河在那儿和密西西比河交汇在一起，它正是我们想要去的目的地；到了那儿，我们就把木筏卖掉，搭坐轮船，沿着俄亥俄河北上，到那些不实行蓄奴制的北方自由州去，那时也不会再碰上麻烦了。

不料，转天夜里忽又大雾笼罩，我们径直向一个可以把木筏拴住的地方划去，因为下大雾没法赶木筏；但我还是带上一根缆索，操起桨往前划过去，没料到那儿除了一些小树以外没有别的可以拴靠的东西。于是，我把缆索挂在那陡岸边沿的一棵小树上，无奈这里水流特别湍急，木筏轧轧作响地一个劲儿往下漂，竟把那棵小树连根拔起，最后也就顺水漂走了。眼看着大雾铺天盖地而来，我心里感到既难过又害怕，呆若木鸡似的几乎有半分钟纹丝不动，——随后，那木筏连影儿也看不见了：反正二十码以外的地方，你就看不清楚了。我跳到小划子上，退到船尾，操起桨使劲划了一下。可它偏偏不往前驶去。原来我急匆匆上了船，没把缆索解开。于是，我站了起来，想去解开缆索，不料我心里感到特别激动，两手直哆嗦，几乎无济于事了。

我一开船，就顺着沙洲，不顾一切地直奔木筏而去。一路上还算顺当，但是这块沙洲全长还不足六十码，我刚掠过沙洲的末端，就堕入白茫茫的浓雾之中，我有如死人一样，真不知道自己该走哪条道了。

我暗自琢磨，还是那样划下去可不行；首先，我知道我会跟河岸，或是沙洲，或是其他什么障碍物相撞；我只好坐着不动，随它漂过去，不过在这样的关键时刻，两手拱着纹丝不动，倒也是让人怪烦躁的。我提高嗓门大喊了一声，侧耳细听。从河下游遥远的地方，我隐隐约约听见一个低微的喊叫声，我的精神顿时为之一振。我连忙循声赶了过去，仔细听听还有没有喊叫声。我再一次听到喊叫声的时候，方才知道我前进方向不是正冲着它，而是偏向它的右边。等那喊叫声再次传过来的时候，我却又在偏向它的左边——也没有赶上它多少，因为我一直在忽东忽西地乱转悠；不过那喊叫声始终是在我的正前方。

我真巴不得那个傻瓜会想到不妨敲洋铁皮锅，一刻不停地敲下去，可是他压根儿没那么做；正是在喊叫声时断时续之间那个寂然无声的时刻，使我感到特别心烦意乱。得了，我拼搏了一阵，猛地听见那喊叫声却在我的背后了。这时，我简直被弄糊涂了。莫非是另一个人的喊叫声，要不然我自个儿又掉过头来了。

我把划桨扔下。我又听见了那喊叫声；它还是在我的后头，只不过换了一个地方；它不断地传过来，不断地变换地方，而我也就不断地应答，不一会儿，它又来到了我的前方，我才知道急流已使我的船头顺水而下，我也算是没事了；反正只要它端的是吉姆的声音，而不是别的赶木筏的人在喊叫就得了。我在大雾里完全听不清楚是谁的声音，因为在大雾里，不管是什么东西，看过去，听起来，全都失真了。

那喊叫声依然不绝如缕。约莫又过了一分钟，我轰然一声撞到了陡岸上，那上头参天树木望过去好像都是浑身冒烟的妖怪似的；湍急的水流把我抛向左边，并从我身边许多喧闹着的水中隐树中间疾逝而去；湍急的水流正是从水中隐树中间像箭也似的飞奔而去，所以更见神速无比了。

再过了一两秒钟，四下里又是一片白茫茫，寂静无声。这时，我纹丝不动地端坐着，倾听自己心跳的声音；我觉得心跳了一百下，还没换过一口气来。

当时，我只好另作打算了。我知道那是怎么回事了。原来陡岸是一座岛，吉姆早被冲到岛那边去了。它可不是一片十分钟你就可从旁边漂过去的沙洲。那岛上的许多大树，倒是一座大岛上常有的；也许这个岛长五六英里，宽半英里多。

我悄没声儿地竖起耳朵，倾听了约莫一刻钟。当然咯，我还是径直往前漂去，一个钟头竟漂了四五英里；只不过你自己从没想到罢了。不，你只觉得自己好像静静地躺在水面上；如果有一棵水中隐树从眼前一闪即逝，你不会想到自己顺水漂流的速度有多快，而只是叹一口气后想，天哪！那棵水中隐树流得多快啊！如果你觉得有人冒着黑夜大雾也是那么顺水漂流，并不算是孤单乏味的话，那不妨请你自己试一试就知道了。

随后过了大约半个钟头，我就时不时大声喊叫；我听见从远处传过来的应答声，就想循声寻去，但我只好徒呼奈何。我马上估摸自己准定置身于一大群沙洲之中，因为我迷迷糊糊地看到身子两侧有些沙洲的影子，有时候当中只隔着一条很窄的河道；还有许多沙洲我虽然看不见，但我知道是有的，因为我听得见湍急的水流在冲刷低垂到岸上的枯树枝条和垃圾堆。过了不久，我又听不见来自这些沙洲的喊叫声了，我只好试着循声追寻了一会儿，因为这可比追鬼火[2]还要不得。你从没听见过一个声音老是这么转来转去地回响，这么快速地、这么频繁地挪换地方。

我有四五回不得不使劲用双手去攫住岸脚，免得这些小岛从河里拱了出去；所以，我估摸那木筏一定也不时撞到河岸上，要不然早就远远地冲到前头去，一点儿声音都听不见了——它漂得可比我稍微快一些。

没有多久，我仿佛又置身于开阔的河面上，不过这一回我打哪儿都听不到任何喊叫声了。我揣想吉姆说不定撞着一棵水中隐树，一下子就完了。眼下我已累得够呛了，所以我就躺在小划子里，决定再也不想多操心了。当然咯，我并不打算睡觉；可是我早已睡意矇眬，实在没辙了；所以，我想我不妨先打个盹儿得了。

不过，我看那倒是十十足足打了一个盹儿，因为我一觉醒过来，那时候，天上的星星亮晶晶，大雾全都消失了，我的船尾已倒转过来，顺着一个大河湾向前淌过去。开头，我真不知道自己在哪儿；我还以为是在梦里呢；待我开始一一回想起来时，眼前依稀见到的好像还是上个星期的事儿似的。

眼前这段河面真的大得吓人，两旁河岸上净是繁茂透顶的参天大树；我借着星光抬眼望去，简直就像一道铜墙铁壁似的。我极目远望河的下游，只见水面上悬浮着一个黑点。我就冲着它赶过去；不料等我一赶上它，只不过是捆扎在一块的两大块圆木头。随后，我看见另一个黑点，又赶了过去；接着又见另一个黑点，这一回我可算没找错。它正是我们的那排木筏。

我来到木筏跟前时，吉姆正坐在那儿，脑袋耷拉在两膝之间睡着了，右胳膊还搭在掌舵的桨上。另一支桨已给撞掉了，木筏上乱糟糟的，净是枯枝、烂叶和污泥。一望可知这木筏也吃足了苦头。

我把小划子拴好后，就在吉姆跟前躺下来，张口打了个哈欠，伸出拳头冲着吉姆说：

“哈啰，吉姆，我睡着了没有？你干吗不叫醒我呢？”

“我的天哪，原来是你呀，哈克？乖乖你没有死啊——你可没有给淹死——瞧你又回来了？这可真的太好了，小宝贝，这可真的太好了。让我来瞧瞧你，小伢儿，让我来摸摸你吧。是哪，你可没有死！你又欢蹦乱跳、太太平平地回来啦，到头来还是咱们原来的那个老哈克——还是原来的那个老哈克，哎呀，真是谢天谢地啊！”

“吉姆，你是怎么啦？你喝醉了吗？”

“喝醉了？难道说我喝醉了吗？我可哪有机会喝酒呀？”

“得了，那你干吗说话这么毫无根据？”

“我怎么说话毫无根据呢？”

“怎么毫无根据？得了，你不是说我又回来了，还有哩哩啦啦那一大套，好像我真的离开这儿似的？”

“哈克——哈克·费恩，你好好地看着我，好好地看着我。难道你真的没离开过这儿吗？”

“离开这儿吗？得了，你到底是什么意思？我哪儿都没有去过呀。你说说我会上哪儿去呢？”

“得了，你且听我说，伙计，这可有点儿不对头，真的。我分明还是我，要不然我是谁呢？我分明是在这儿，要不然我又是在哪儿呢？这我可要闹个明白。”

“哦，我说你分明是在这儿，这可错不了，不过，吉姆，我觉得你是个老糊涂虫。”

“我是吧，我是吗？我倒要先问问你：你没有坐上小划子，抄着缆索，想把木筏在沙洲上拴住吗？”

“我可没有。什么沙洲？我压根儿没见过什么沙洲呢。”

“你没见过沙洲吗？你听着——那根缆索不是没拴紧，木筏就顺水冲下去，把你和小划子都扔到大雾里了吗？”

“什么大雾呀？”

“怎么啦，就是那大雾呗。那大雾整整下了一夜。难道说你没有喊叫过，我也没有喊叫过，一直到后来我们围着那些小岛转得晕头晕脑，我们两人里头有一个迷路了，另一个差不离也迷路了，因为谁都不知道谁上哪儿去了，你说可不是？我不是还困在那些小岛上，吃足了苦头，差点儿没给淹死吗？那时是不是这样，伙计——是不是这样？你回答我就得了。”

“哦，你可把我给弄糊涂了，吉姆。我压根儿没见过什么大雾，也没见过什么小岛，更没碰见过什么麻烦，什么都没见过。我整整一夜老坐在这儿跟你闲扯，一直扯到大约十分钟以前，你就睡着了，跟着我觉得自己也睡着了。那么短短的一会儿，你断断乎不会喝醉了，不用说，你准是在做梦。”

“真是天知道，我怎能在十分钟里头梦见过那么多事儿呢？”

“嘿，真该死的，你果真是在做梦，因为那时什么事儿都没有。”

“不过，哈克，我觉得那些事儿都是清清楚楚，就像——”

“清楚不清楚，都是一个样，反正什么事儿都没有。我可自己知道，因为我自始至终一直待在这儿。”

约莫有五分钟，吉姆一言不发，只是坐在那里仔细琢磨。随后，他说：

“得了，我想那时我果真是在做梦，哈克；可是，真该死，这一场大噩梦，我一辈子都没见过。从前我也做梦，但都没有像这一回让我感到那么累过。”

“哦，那倒是一点儿没错，因为有的时候做梦真的叫人够累的。不过，这一场梦可真是帅——你就从头到尾给我说说吧，吉姆。”

于是，吉姆就开了腔，把事情的来龙去脉全给我说了，他都是实话实说，只不过有好多地方他还是大肆渲染一番。他说他非得“圆一下”这个梦不可，因为这是老天爷发出的一个预兆。他说，头一个沙洲是代表想要给我们做些好事的好人，可那湍急的水流却是个坏人，一心让我们离开好人。那些喊叫声都是不时向我们传来的警告，如果说我们不动脑筋吃透这些警告的意思，它们就会让我们倒运，而不是让我们躲开倒运。那一大群沙洲就是代表我们要跟那些动不动吵架、卑鄙透顶的家伙发生的麻烦，不过，要是我们只管自己的事，不跟他们顶嘴，不招惹他们，我们就会渡过难关，走出大雾，来到辽阔的大河——那里就是不实行蓄奴制的自由州，我们再也不会碰上什么麻烦了。

我刚爬到木筏上的时候，天已黑糊糊阴下来，可现在又一下子晴朗了。

“得了，敢情好，吉姆，到目前为止，你圆得总算还不错，”我说，“可是这些玩意儿指的又是什么呢？”

“这些玩意儿指的就是木筏上的那些枯枝、烂叶和垃圾，还有那根撞砸了的桨。这会儿你可以看得清清楚楚了。”

吉姆先看了一下那堆赃物，稍后又看了一下我，回过头来再看了一下那堆赃物。他脑海里牢记着这个梦，好像一时萦绕不去，马上又联想起一些事实来了。不过，待他一闹明白了，他就目不转睛地瞅着我，敛起笑容，说：

“它们指的又是什么呢？我这就告诉你吧。我因为一面使劲地划桨，一面又拼命地叫唤你，早已筋疲力尽，随后我也就睡着了，那时候，我差不离已经心碎了，因为你已经丢失了，至于我自个儿和木筏将来会怎么样，我也就都无所谓了。后来，我一醒过来，发觉你回来了，太太平平地回来了，我不由得掉了眼泪，我还会跪在地上去亲吻你的脚，我心里确有说不出的高兴。可是没料到，你却一个劲儿暗自琢磨，编造假话来捉弄我老吉姆。那边一大堆都是垃圾；凡是往朋友头上抹屎、让他们出洋相的人，都是垃圾。”

说罢，他就慢吞吞地站了起来，往小窝棚走去，除了这些话，他再也没有吭声，就走进去了。不过这已经够我受的。真让我觉得自己太卑鄙，我几乎要过去亲吻他的脚，让他把那些话收回去。

过了一刻钟，我才振作起来，低声下气地走到一个黑人跟前道歉——我道歉过了，以后也不后悔。我再也不出坏点子捉弄他了，要是我早知道这会使他心里那么难过的话，我才不会耍那套把戏呢。

第十六章


我们几乎睡了整整一天，到了夜里才上路；赶在我们前头的，是一排长得出奇的木筏，好像一支长长的游行队伍似的。木筏每一头都有四把掌握航向的长桨，依我们看，它大概可以搭乘多达三十个人。木筏上有五座大窝棚，彼此间隔很远，正中央燃起一堆露天篝火，每一头还竖起一根大旗杆。看起来它很有气派。在这样帅的木筏上当个撑筏人，可真的是了不起呀。

我们顺水漂进了一个大河湾，这天夜里，阴云密布，天气又很闷热。这一段河面宽阔极了，茂密的参天大树像大墙似的排列在河的两岸；你几乎看不出那儿有什么豁口，或者有一点儿亮光来。我们谈到了开罗，真不知道身临其境认不认得哩。我说恐怕我们不认得，因为我听人说过那里才只有十几户人家，要是碰上他们正好没有掌灯，我们哪儿会知道自己正在路过一个小镇呢？吉姆说，只要那两条大河在那儿汇合，那一看就会知道了。可是我说，也许我们会以为自己路过一座岛的末端，照旧又回到了原来的那条大河。这么一来，让吉姆感到烦躁不安——我也是一样。反正问题是明摆着，那究竟该怎么办才好呢？我说，只要一看见有灯光，赶紧操起桨划到河岸边，索性告诉人家，说老爸就在后头跟着商船一块儿过来，他刚刚学做生意，想要打听一下这儿离开罗该有多远。吉姆一听这是个好点子，于是我们就一面抽起烟来，一面耐心等着。

眼下我们只好目不转睛地凝望着前方，切莫视而不见地把那个小镇给错过了。吉姆说他准看得见，因为他一看见那个小镇，他就成了自由人，可是他万一错过了，又到了贩卖奴隶的地方，看样子他就再也得不到自由了。于是，他动不动就跳起来说：

“它就在那边！”

可它并不是小镇。原来是鬼火，或者是萤火虫罢了。于是，他又坐下来，依然一眼不眨地凝望着。吉姆说他因为离自由越来越近了，使他浑身上下发抖、发烧。得了，我听他这么一说，也让我浑身上下发抖、发烧，因为我脑子里明白他差不多已经自由了——这该责怪谁呢？反正是责怪我呗。不管怎样，我也不能不受自己良心责备。这件事使我心烦意乱，坐立不安，到哪儿都没法泰然自若。我从没想到过我正在干的究竟是什么事。可是现在我想起它来了；它老在我心里萦绕不去，而且动不动挖苦我。我想竭力给自己申辩，说这可不能责怪我，因为我并没有让吉姆从他合法的主人那里逃跑；但是这都不管用，每一回我的良心都说：“可你明明知道他是为了奔向自由而逃跑，你本来可能划到河岸上去，对人家说明嘛。”事情就是这样——我怎么也回避不了。说难也难在这里。良心对我说：“难道说可怜的沃森小姐因为亏待过你，她手下的黑奴在你眼皮底下逃跑，你看见了连一句话都不说？请问那个可怜的老妇人在哪儿亏待了你，才使你对她如此缺德呢？说实话，她竭尽全力地教你念书，她不遗余力地教你做人，反正她千方百计想要对你好。一句话，她就是那样对待你啊。”

我不由得感到自己实在太卑劣、太糟糕了，恨不得马上死掉算了。我在木筏上烦躁不安地走来走去，暗地里自己骂自己，这时吉姆也挨在我身边烦躁不安地走来走去。我们俩谁都心情平静不下来。每当他手舞足蹈地嚷着说：“那可不就是开罗嘛！”我一听就像身上挨了一枪似的，我想如果说那真的是开罗的话，说不定我会难受死了。

吉姆一直在大声说话，可我老是在自言自语。他说：一到了不实行蓄奴制的自由州，他要做的头一件事，就是拼命地积攒钱，一分钱也不花，等到积攒够了，那时他要去邻近沃森小姐家的那个农场，把自己的老婆给赎回来；随后，他们两口子打工挣钱，把那两个孩子也都给赎回来；要是他们的主人不肯卖的话，他们就踅摸一个废奴派，干脆把孩子们偷回来。

我听了他这一套话，几乎凉了半截。要是在从前，他怎么也不敢说这等话。只要看一看他刚才认为他快要得到自由了，马上就跟从前判若两人了。老话说得好：“黑鬼总是得寸进尺。”[1]我暗自琢磨：这都是我不动脑筋造成的结果。眼前这个黑人，差不多就是靠我帮忙逃出来的，现在他打开窗子说亮话，竟要把他的孩子们偷回来——至于孩子们究竟归属哪一个人，我可压根儿不认得；反正此人从来也没有得罪过我。

我听了吉姆的这些话，心里挺难过，因为这无异于降低了他的身份。我的良心又把我唤醒，使我感到无比激动，到最后我就对自己的良心说：“别跟我过不去吧——现在还不算太晚——只要一看见灯光，我就划到岸上去告发他。”于是，我马上心里感到自在、高兴，浑身轻快有如一支翎毛似的。我所有的烦恼一下子都消除了。我抬眼凝望着岸上有没有灯光，自己心里就像在唱歌似的。没有多久，岸上露出来一点儿灯光。吉姆乐不可支地大声嚷着说：

“我们可得救了，哈克，我们可得救了！赶快跳起来，跺脚吧[2]！我们终于来到了老开罗这个好地方，我包管知道！”

我说：

“让我先坐小划子过去看看，吉姆。你要知道，也许那还不是开罗呢？”

他跳过去把小划子准备停当，他的旧外套已铺垫在舱底，让我坐在上面，接着把划桨交给了我；我刚把小划子撑开的时候，他说：

“我马上就要高兴得大喊大叫了，我会说，这可都得归功于哈克；现在我是个自由人了，要是没有哈克，我永远也不会得到自由；这多亏是哈克做的好事。我吉姆一辈子都忘不了你，哈克；你是我吉姆顶顶好的朋友；现在，你也是我老吉姆独一无二的朋友。”

我刚操起桨把小划子开走，急得一身汗，想去告发他；可是一听他说的上面这些话，看来我一下子泄了气。我就慢慢吞吞地朝前划去，我闹不清楚此时此刻自己是高兴还是不高兴。待我到达了五十码开外的时候，吉姆说：

“你走了，你这个忠实的老哈克；在白人里头，只有你对我老吉姆说话算话。”

我听了觉得怪不高兴。可我还是说，这件事我是非做不可——我可不是胡诌的。正在这会儿，开过来了一只小划艇，里头有两个持枪的人，他们停下来了，我也只好停下来了。他们里头有一个人说：

“那边是什么？”

“是一排木筏。”我说。

“你就是那木筏上的人吗？”

“是的，先生。”

“那上头还有人吗？”

“只有一个人，先生。”

“今儿晚上，河湾口上头逃跑了五个黑鬼。你那个人是白人，还是黑人？”

我可没有马上回答。我本想回答的，可是话儿老说不出来。我试过了一两秒钟，想要壮一壮胆地说出来，可我偏偏没有那么大的胆量——连一只兔子的胆量都没有。我知道我已力不从心了；我就只好无可奈何地回答说：

“他是个白人。[3]”

“我看我们还得亲自过过目才好。”

“我也巴不得你们亲自过过目呢，”我说，“因为那边是我的老爸，也许你们肯帮忙，把木筏拖到那儿有灯光的地方去。他得病了——妈妈跟玛丽·安也都得病了。”

“嘿，亏你说的！我们可忙得不可开交，孩子。不过我说我们还得去。去吧——使劲划你的桨，咱们一块儿去吧。”

我就使劲地划我的桨，他们也使劲地划他们的小划艇。我们才划了一两下，我就说：

“我敢说，我老爸准会从心眼儿里感激你们啦。我求过人家帮我把木筏拖到岸边去，不拘是谁都扭头就走，可我独个儿却又拖不动。”

“那真该死的，够缺德的，也是够奇怪的。我说，孩子，你老爸得的是什么病呀？”

“他得的是——那——个——哦，可不是什么大不了的病。”

他们都打住不划桨了。这时离开木筏已经不太远了。他们里头有一个人说：

“孩子，你这是在说假话。你老爸到底得了什么病？现在，你给我直截了当地说，那对你会有好处。”

“那我一定说，先生，我一定老老实实地说——不过，求求你们，千万别甩开我们。那种病是——是——诸位先生，只要你们径直往前划去，让我把木筏头上的缆索扔给你们，你们就用不着一直划到木筏跟前——求求你们行个好吧。”

“把小划艇开回去，约翰，快点儿开回去！”一个人说。说罢，他们立时往后开回去了。“快闪开，孩子——躲到下风处。该死的，我估摸着那阵风已经冲我们把它刮过来了。你老爸得的是天花，你心里可要比谁都明白。可你干吗不一下子都说出来呢？难道说你存心让大家都给传染上吗？”

“哦，”我哇哇地哭着说，“以前我不管见着谁都说实话，可是他们听了个个扭头就走，压根儿不管我们了。”

“可怜的小东西，原来你也有一本难念的经。现在我们心里也替你难过，可是我们——得了，去它的，我们可都不想得天花，你要明白。你听着，我就告诉你该怎么办。你单独一个人可千万别上岸，要不然你准定坏事了。你不妨还是顺水而下，再漂过去二十来英里，你就会来到大河边上的一个小镇。那时候，太阳早已出来了，你就不妨求人帮忙，对他们说你一家子都在打摆子，发高烧。别再傻里傻气，让人家猜摸着是怎么回事。现在我们尽力想要帮你一下忙；所以，你务必离开我们二十英里远，那才算是个好孩子。你要是在有灯光的那边上了岸，也不见得有什么好处——那边才不过是个贮木场。嘿——我估摸着你老爸准定穷得很，我敢说他也是倒霉透顶。得啦——我把这枚价值二十块的金币，放在这块板子上，等它一漂过去，你就把它收下来吧。我觉得把你扔下不管，也是够缺德的，可是，我的天哪！得了天花可不是好玩的，你知道不知道？”

“且慢，帕克，”另一个人说，“这枚二十块的金币，也替我放在板子上，算是我给他的。再见吧，孩子，你就照着帕克先生对你说的话去做，准定没事啦。”

“得啦，我的好孩子——再见，再见。你要是见到逃跑的黑鬼，就找人帮忙，把他们逮住，你还可以赚一点儿钱呢。”

“再见，先生，”我说，“我绝不会放走一个逃跑的黑鬼，只要我力所能及的话。”

他们开走了，我就登上了木筏，心里难过极了，因为我深深知道自己做了一件错事，我心里明白自己就是想学好也不管用；一个人打从小时候开始就不好，往后也绝不会有好的表现——一旦危急时，也没有什么东西来支持他，让他坚持到底，于是他就垮下来了。接着，我又想了一分钟，暗自琢磨着：且慢——假如说你做对了，把吉姆交出来，难道你的感受会比现在好一点吗？我说，不会的，我还会感到难过——我会感到如同现在一样难过。得了，我说，做对了惹麻烦，做错了没事儿，而付出的代价都是一个样，那你干吗非要学着做对不可呢？我一下子给难住了。这个问题我可回答不了。所以，我想自己再也不必为它犯愁了，打这以后，只要是最不费劲的事，照做不误就得了。

我走进了小窝棚，可吉姆不在那里。我举目四顾，哪儿都见不到他。我就大声嚷道：

“吉姆！”

“我在这儿，哈克。他们都没影儿了吧？说话小声点儿。”

原来他是在河里，躲在木筏的尾桨底下，只是让鼻子露出水面。我告诉他说，他们早已没影儿了，于是他就爬上来了。他说：

“我听见你们在说话，我就溜到河里去，要是他们到木筏上来，我不妨游到岸边去。他们走了以后，我再回到木筏上来。可是，我的天哪，你可把他们捉弄了一番，哈克！你这一招可真漂亮！我告诉你，小伢儿，我说这可救了我老吉姆一命——我老吉姆忘不了你的恩情啊，小宝贝。”

随后，我们就谈到那些钱。这可真的捞进了一大笔——每人各得二十块金币。吉姆说，现在我们上轮船可以坐统舱，这些钱足够我们在那些不实行蓄奴制的自由州里到处走，想走多远就走多远。他说，撑着木筏再走二十来英里，算不上太远，可他巴不得我们早已到了那里。

天快破晓时，我们就靠了岸，吉姆特别小心地把木筏隐藏得好好的。随后，他忙活了一整天，把东西都捆扎好，一切都准备停当，只待离开木筏。

那天夜里约莫十点钟，我们在下游靠左的河湾附近，看见一个灯光闪烁的小镇。

我坐了小划子过去，想要探听一下。没多久，我发现河上有一个人坐着小船，正撒下一条曳钓绳。我冲他划过去，问：

“先生，那个小镇就是开罗吗？”

“开罗？不是的。你该死的准是个大傻瓜。”

“那它是个什么小镇，先生？”

“你要想知道的话，就自己过去看看清楚。你要是在这儿再打扰我大约半分钟的话，我就让你吃不了兜着走啦。”

于是，我就向木筏划了过去。吉姆感到大失所望，可是我说没什么，依我看，下一个地方就是开罗了。

我们在天亮以前开过了另一个小镇，我本想再上岸去看看；不料那一带地势很高，所以我没有去成。吉姆说，开罗附近是没有高地的。可我不知怎的早就给忘了。这一天，我们就在邻近河左岸的一个沙洲上好歹给打发过去了。我开始将信将疑起来。吉姆也是一样。我说：

“也许我们就在下大雾的那天夜里，把开罗错过去了吧。”

他说：

“别扯那个了，哈克。可怜的黑人是不会走好运的。我一直怀疑那块响尾蛇皮在作祟，还远没有完呢。”

“吉姆，我可巴不得没见过那块蛇皮才好——我真巴不得压根儿就没见过它。”

“那可并不是你的错，哈克，你压根儿不知道。你可不要一味责怪自己。”

等到大天亮的时候，这边不消说是碧澄一色的俄亥俄河，外侧就是那条古老的、始终浑浊的大河[4]！可见开罗的确是错过去了。

我们就这件事全都交谈过了。打岸上走是不行的；当然咯，我们也没法让木筏逆水北上。毫无办法可想，只好等到天黑，再坐小划子回去碰碰运气。所以，我们在棉白杨树丛里睡上了一整天，以便干起活来有力气；没料到天快黑下来的时候，我们回到木筏上一看，那只小划子连影儿都不见了！

我们有老半天没吭声。其实也没什么好说的了。我们两人都知道这又是那块响尾蛇皮在作祟；那再谈它还管什么用呢？那好像是我们还在自怨自艾，到头来还得招灾惹祸——也就这样一直倒霉下去，最后学乖了，只好一气不吭。

后来，我们又谈到究竟该怎么应付才好，我们觉得没有别的办法，只好让木筏顺水而下，直到我们碰上机会，另买一只小划子再赶回去。虽然四周围什么人都没有，可是我们并不打算去借一只，就像老爸惯常顺手牵羊似的，因为那么一来就会有人追我们来了。

所以，等天黑了以后，我们就撑着木筏开走了。

如果在那块蛇皮向我们作祟以后，人们还不相信耍弄蛇皮乃是蠢事的话，那么，他们只要再往下看看，一看到它仍然向我们继续作祟，就会相信了。

要买小划子，就得找岸边停靠的木筏。可是我们看不到有木筏停靠在岸边，所以，我们就径直往前走了三个多钟头。这时，夜色越发阴沉凝重，差不多如同下大雾一样令人腻味。你说不清河上的动静，也看不出距离该有多远。约莫到了万籁俱寂的深夜，忽见一条上水轮船开过来。于是，我们立时点亮提灯，揣摸着它一定看得见。通常上水轮船是不会靠近我们的；它们总是向外拐，顺着沙洲，收缩帆篷，踅摸平缓的水道驶去，但在这样漆黑的深夜，它们就逆流而上，奋力行进。

我们听得见它轰隆轰隆地开过来，不过一直要等它开到跟前方才看得清楚，它是冲着我们开过来的。有时候，他们就是这样开过来的，想要看一看怎样跟我们擦身而过，但又不会发生碰撞；有时候，水轮将一把长桨给砸掉了，那个领航员探出头来，哈哈大笑，觉得自己露了一手真帅。眼下，它离我们越来越近了，我们说，眼看着它要给我们刮胡子了；但是看来它一点儿也没有改变航向。它是一艘大型船只，又是来势迅猛，望过去好像是一堆乌云，四周围发出好几排萤火虫似的亮光；可是蓦然间，它却凸现成庞然大物，简直令人害怕，长长的一排敞开的锅炉门，有如烧红了的牙齿似的喷吐出火光来；它那大得惊人的船头和防护装置，已经高悬在我们头顶上了。冲我们而来的是一声喊叫，还有要关掉发动机的叮叮当当的一阵铃响，末了是一片咒骂声和放汽时的啸叫声——这时候，吉姆和我各自从木筏两头刚跳入水中，我们的木筏一下子就被大船撞碎了。

我猛地钻进水里——也就是想要摸一下河底，因为这条大船上有一个三十英尺的大水轮是在我头顶上转动的，所以我要拥有足够回旋的余地。平日里我在水里能待一分钟；这一回我估摸着自己在水里却待了一分半钟。随后，我急不可待地往上一蹿，蹿出了水面，因为那时我差不多快要憋死了。我猛地冒出头来，但是我的胳肢窝仍在水里，这时我既用嘴往外吐水，又用鼻子孔往外喷水。当然，这一带水流向来湍急；不消说，这条大船只停了十秒钟，随后又打开发动机了，因为他们那些人对撑筏人是从来不放在眼里的。反正现在它正在浪花翻腾中奋力逆水而上，渐渐消失在茫茫的黑夜里，虽然我还能依稀听到它的声音。

我大声喊过了吉姆十多次，可是我都没听到他回话。当我正在“踩水”的时候，碰着一块木板，我就抓住了它往岸边悬浮过去。但是我发觉这儿河水是向左岸流去的，这就是说，我已来到了一个渡口；所以，我就改变方向，冲着那儿游过去。

那是一个有两英里长、歪斜的渡口；所以，我耗去了很多时间才游了过去。我选定了一个安全地点，才爬到岸上来。我看不出有什么好办法，只好在那高低不平的地上，一边探听，一边往前走了四分之一英里，不知怎的来到了一幢老式特大木头房子跟前。我本想一闪而过，立时离开那里，不料有好几条狗从里头蹿出来，冲我狂吠不休，所以，我觉得此时此刻还是一动也不动为好。

第十七章


约莫过了半分钟，有人打从窗子里往外说话，但是脑袋并没有探出来。他说：

“别乱叫啦，宝贝们！是谁在外面呀？”

我说：

“是我。”

“谁是‘我’呀？”

“先生，我是乔治·杰克逊。”

“你有什么贵干呀？”

“我什么贵干都没有，先生。我只想打这儿走过去，可是这几条狗偏偏不让我走。”

“深更半夜，你干吗鬼鬼祟祟地来这儿乱转悠——?”

“我可不是鬼鬼祟祟地乱转悠，先生。我是从轮船上掉到河里去的。”

“哦，这话是你说的，是真的吗？喂，你们哪一位给我划一根火柴。那你就说说你的尊姓大名呀。”

“先生，我叫乔治·杰克逊。我才不过是小伢儿呢。”

“你听我说：要是你说的是实话，你就用不着害怕——没有人会伤害你。不过，你还得一动也不动，就在你原地站好。你们几个人把博布和汤姆都给叫起来，把枪也要拿来。乔治·杰克逊，还有别人跟你在一块儿吗？”

“没有，先生。”

现在我听到有一些人在屋里走动，还看见一点儿灯光。那个人大声喊道：

“快把那个灯端走，贝慈，你这老笨蛋——你怎么老是拎不清的？把它搁在前门后头地板上。博布，要是你跟汤姆全都预备好了，你们只管各就各位得了。”

“全都预备好了。”

“现在我问你，乔治·杰克逊，你认不认得谢泼德逊家里的人？”

“不认得，先生——我压根儿就没听说过。”

“敢情好，也许这是实话，也许不是。哦，全都预备好了。乔治·杰克逊，你走过来吧。记住，你可急不得——要慢吞吞、慢吞吞地走过来。要是有人跟你在一块儿，就让他待在后面得了——他要是一亮相，就得一枪给毙了。得了，过来吧。慢吞吞地走过来吧。你自己把那道门推开来——稍微推开一点儿，只要挤得进来就得了，你听见了没有？”

我一点儿也不急，我就是想急一点儿也不行。我每一次只好慢吞吞地迈出一步，一点儿响声都没有，只不过我觉得好像听见了自己怦然心跳的声音。那几条狗也跟人一样默不作声，只是紧跟在我背后罢了。我一到了那三大根原木的门阶跟前，就听见了他们正在开锁、移动门闩、拔去插销的声音。我用手在门上轻轻地推了一两下，后来有人说：“得啦，那就够了——把你的脑袋伸进来。”于是，我就照伸不误了，但我暗自琢磨也许他们会摘掉我的脑袋。

蜡烛竖立在地板上，他们全都在那里瞅着我，我也瞅着他们，约莫有二十来秒钟光景。有三个身材高大的男人拿枪指指戳戳地对着我，说实话，真让我浑身直抽搐。年纪最大的那一个，满头白发，约莫六十开外了，另外两个都是三十岁左右——三个人都长得好端端的，挺漂亮——还有一个非常讨人喜爱的、满头斑白的老妇人，她背后跟着两个年轻的女人，但是我不能看得十分真切。那位老先生说：

“哦——我想没事了吧。进来吧。”

我一走进去，那位老先生就把门锁上，闩好，并且还插上插销。他关照那两个年轻人拿着枪走过来，他们就一块儿走进了一个大客厅，大客厅地板上铺着一块碎布头编成的新地毯。他们全都待在离前窗很远的一个角落里——这里连一个窗子也没有。他们擎着蜡烛，把我仔细端详了一番，随后异口同声地说：“哦，他可不是谢泼德逊家里的人——不是的，谢泼德逊家里的人的派头，在他身上一丁点儿都没有呀。”接下来这个老人说要搜身，看我有没有带武器，希望我不要介意，因为这种搜身谈不上有什么恶意——不外乎是想再核实一下罢了。因此，他并没有搜抄我的口袋，只不过用手在外面捋了一下，就说，得了，没事啦。他关照我要像在自己家里一样，不必拘谨，还要我把有关个人的事通通说出来；可是那位老妇人却说：

“哎哟哟，我的天哪，索尔，你瞧这个可怜的孩子身上湿得够呛；你觉得他会不会——肚子饿了？”

“你说得真不错，雷切尔——可我却给忘了。”

这位老妇人接着就说：

“贝慈，”（这是一个黑人妇女）“赶快给他踅摸一点儿吃食，越快越好，瞧他怪可怜的；你们里头哪一个过去把巴克叫醒，通知他——哦，他自己已经来啦。巴克，你把这位小客人带去，让他把身上的湿衣服都脱下来，再把你自己的一些干衣服让他穿上。”

论年纪，巴克看上去跟我差不多——才不过是十三四岁[1]左右，但他长得比我的个儿大一点儿。他身上只穿着一件衬衫，瞧他一脸脏相。他走过来时还在打哈欠，一个拳头在揉眼睛，另一只手里提着一支枪。他说：

“谢泼德逊家的人没有过来吧？”

他们回答说，没有，原来是一场虚惊罢了。

“哦，”他说，“要是他们真的敢过来，我想我包管逮着一个。”

他们全都哈哈大笑了。博布说：

“算了吧，巴克，要是像你这么慢慢吞吞地过来，恐怕他们早就把我们的头皮都给剥掉了。”

“反正压根儿就没人来叫我，那怪谁呢。我老是低人一等，叫我怎么露一手呢。”

“别提了，巴克，好孩子，”那位老人说，“你早晚能露一手的，往后机会有的是，用不着犯愁。快去吧，照妈妈点拨你的去做就得了。”

我们上楼来到了他的房间里，他把自己的一件粗布衬衫、一件紧身短上衣和一条裤子交给了我，我就一一都给穿上了。趁这工夫，他就问我叫什么名字来着，可我还来不及回答，他已抢先告诉我，前天他在树林子里捉到一只蓝樱鸟和一只小兔子；他还问我，蜡烛熄灭了的时候，摩西在什么地方。我说我可不知道；这事我压根儿就没听说过。

“得了，你就猜猜看吧。”他说。

“那我怎能猜得着呢？”我说，“反正我从前压根儿没听说过。”

“不过你照样可以猜呀，可不是？再便当不过了。”

“哪一支蜡烛呀？”我问。

“反正不管是哪一支都行。”他说。

“我可不知道他在哪儿，”我说，“你说说他是在什么地方呀？”

“嘿，他就是在黑暗那儿呢[2]！原来他就是待在那个地方！”

“得了，要是你早就知道他在哪儿，干吗还要问我？”

“嘿，真该死，那是个谜语，你不知道吗？我说，你打算在我们这儿待多久呀？你就得老待在这儿才好。咱们正好痛痛快快地乐一阵子——眼下也用不着上学啦。你自己有没有养过狗？我自己有一条狗——它会赶过去，把你扔到河里的油炸土豆片给叼回来。星期天你喜欢把头发梳得晶光锃亮，或是做类似那样的蠢事吗？当然咯，我压根儿不喜欢，可妈妈她硬是逼着我呢。该死的，这条裤子，我想我还是穿上的好，虽然我真的不乐意穿，热得够呛。那你都穿好了吗？得了——走吧，老朋友。”

冷的玉米饼，冷的腌牛肉，还有黄油和脱脂乳——以上这些就是他们在楼下给我预备的，也是我从来没见过的一顿美餐。巴克和他的妈妈，跟所有在场的人都在抽玉米芯烟斗，只有刚离开这儿的黑人妇女和两个年轻的女人，算是例外。他们全都在一边抽烟，一边闲扯；而我则是一边吃饭，一边闲扯。那两个年轻的女人披着有衬垫的大褂，头发都被甩到身子背后。他们都向我提过好多问题，我就告诉他们说，老爸、我和所有家里的人，原住在阿肯色[3]低洼地以南一个小农场上，我姐姐玛丽·安从家里出走，嫁了人以后再也没有消息了。比尔四处去找过他们，可后来连他本人也没有音讯了。汤姆跟莫特都死了，光剩下了我跟老爸；老爸因为接二连三老是倒霉透顶，到最后也就一贫如洗了；所以，等他死了以后所剩下的一点破玩意儿，我就一块儿带走了，因为那个农场毕竟不是我们自己家里的。随后，我上船住统舱，逆水北上，自己不小心，却掉到河里去了。一来二去，我就是这样来到这儿的。所以，他们就说，我可以把这儿不妨当作自己的家，要住多久就住多久。这时候，天色快亮了，大家都去睡觉，我就跟巴克一块儿去睡。转天早上，我一觉醒来的时候，真该死，我把自己的名字都给忘了。所以，我躺在床上回想了差不多个把钟头，等到巴克醒了，我就说：

“你会念字吗，巴克？”

“我会的。”他说。

“我敢说，你不会念我的名字。”我说。

“我敢说，只要你会的，我也都会。”他说。

“得了，”我说，“你这就念念吧。”

“你的名字就是‘叫——子——夹——个——城’[4]，可不是吗？”他说。

“得了，”我说，“你果然念出来了，但开头我还以为你不会念呢。这并不算是什么难念的名字——一看就念出来了。”

我偷偷地把它记下来；说不定下次有人会叫我念的，所以，我要做到对答如流，一点儿咯噔都没有，仿佛是早已说惯了似的。

眼前是怪可爱的一家人，又是在怪可爱的一幢房子里。我在乡下还从来没见过一幢房子有它那么雅致，那么大的气派。大门上既没有铁铸门闩，也没有跟鹿皮带连在一起的木制门闩，但是安上能转动的黄铜把手，如同城市里的住宅一模一样。客厅里没有安放眠床，连眠床的一丝痕迹也都没有；但在城市里的很多客厅都置放着眠床。这里有一座大壁炉，底座是用砖块铺砌的，这些砖面都保养得洁净而又红亮，因为平日里都要泼上净水，并用另一块砖去擦洗的。有时候，他们还给砖面上抹上一种红色水彩颜料（他们管它叫作西班牙褐色涂料），就像城市里的人常常涂抹的那样。他们在壁炉里还放上一些大号黄铜薪架，可以把一大段锯木架起来。壁炉架正中央置放着一台座钟，钟面玻璃的下方，有一幅小镇的风景画，画的中央有个圆块，代表太阳；你可以见到那幅画后面的钟摆在来回摆动。听到这台座钟发出嘀嗒嘀嗒的声音，真是太悦耳了。有时候，一位修钟表的工匠上门来了，给它擦洗油泥，调试得好好的，于是一拧发条，它就连续不断地敲了一百五十响，这才好像累得敲不动了。人家修好以后，照例是分文不取。

这台座钟的两侧，竖着一对稀奇古怪的大鹦鹉，好像是用白灰制成的，外面涂得红红绿绿的，俗气极了。在一只鹦鹉旁边，有一头陶猫；在另一只鹦鹉旁边，则有一头陶狗；你要是向它们使劲摁一下，它们就发出吱吱的叫声，但是它们并不张开嘴巴，样子也不变，更谈不上有什么表情了。那种吱叫声是从底部发出来的。就在这些小摆设背后，展示出两把用野火鸡彩翅制成的大扇子。在客厅的正中央一张桌子上，有一只惹人喜爱的陶制篮子，篮里堆满了苹果、橘子、桃子、葡萄，都要比真的水果红得多，黄得多，而且好看得多啦，可惜毕竟不是真的，因为你可以看到，它们的表皮已有一些斑斑点点剥落下来，里面的白灰之类的东西也都绽露出来了。

这张桌子上还覆盖着一块很美丽的漆布，上面画的是一头红蓝两色、展翅飞翔的老鹰，四周围都是彩绘花边。据说它是从遥远的费城运来的。还有好几本书方方正正地置放在桌子的四角上。有一本是大部头家用《圣经》，里头图画比比皆是。有一本是《天路历程》[5]，说的是有一个人离家出走了，可并没有说出自己出走的原因。偶尔我也看过一些，觉得怪有趣的，但就是啃不动。还有一本，书名叫作《友谊的奉献》[6]，书里充满了诗情画意，可是我并没有去看那些诗。另外一本是亨利·克莱[7]的演说集；还有一本是甘大夫的《家庭医药大全》，详细指点你万一有人病了或是死了，究竟该怎么处置。还有一本赞美诗，以及好多其他的书。客厅里还有好几把薄木条编成的椅子，全都是完整无损——椅垫当中没有像破篮子似的塌下去，或是裂开了。

他们在四壁挂上了好多画——多半是华盛顿和拉斐德[8]的画像，描写战争的画，一幅名叫《玛丽》[9]的画，还有一幅画名叫“签署《独立宣言》”。有好几张他们所谓的蜡笔画，乃是他们的一位已故女儿画的，那一年她才十五岁。这些蜡笔画，跟我以前见过的迥然不同——多半要比常见的蜡笔画黑得多。有一幅画的是一个女人，身穿一套瘦长的黑色衣裙，胳肢窝底下都用带子束得紧紧的，两只袖子管中间凸了起来，像两棵大白菜似的，头上戴着一顶偌大的、赛过长柄铲的黑色女帽，前面还挂下来一块黑色面纱，纤细白净的脚踝上系着黑色缎带，脚上穿着一双小不点儿的黑色拖鞋，妤像两副凿子似的；她若有所思地伫立在一棵垂柳底下，用右肘偎靠着一块墓碑；她的左手则垂在另侧，拿着一块白色手绢和一只手提网兜。在这张画下端题着：“哎呀，难道我永远见不到你吗？”另一张画的是一位年轻的姑娘，她把自己的秀发一直往上梳到头顶，就在一把梳子前面绾了个扣儿，好像一块椅子靠背似的。而且她正在用手绢捂着脸儿哭泣，她的另一只手里却仰面躺着一只死鸟儿。就在这张画的下端题着：“哎呀，我再也听不见你那曼妙的歌声了。”还有一张，画的是一位年轻的姑娘，正在凭窗仰望月亮，粉腮上淌着两行泪珠；她手里拿着一封拆过的信，信封边上还沾着一块黑色火漆，她把这封信连同那带着项链的精美小锦盒一块贴在自己嘴上。在这张画下端题着：“你走了吗？哎呀，你果真走了！”我暗自揣摸着，所有这些都是很好的画，但我不知怎的对它们好像不太欣赏，因为要是我心里不大开心的时候，这些画总会让我越发烦躁不安。对于她的死，大家都感到很惋惜，因为她生前还有很多如此这般的画没有画出来，而且，从她所画的遗作里，也可以看出她的死给大家带来多么大的损失。不过话又说回来，依我看，像她这样脾性的人，还是乐得到坟墓里去要痛快得多。当她正在画一幅画——据说是她最最了不起的作品——的时候，她却病倒了；于是，她就日日夜夜地做祷告，祈求上帝让她多活些日子，画完了这幅画再死也不迟，无奈她始终没能如愿以偿。那幅画上画的是一个年轻的妇人，身穿一袭长长的白色礼服，站立在一座桥的栏杆上，却准备好往河里跳下去；她的头发都披散在背后，抬头仰望着月亮，泪水顺着两颊往下淌。她有两只胳膊交叉合抱在胸前，另有两只伸向前方，此外还有两只是高高地举了起来，像要去攀摘月亮似的——原来她的构思是要先看一看究竟哪双胳膊样子最好看，随后再把别的胳膊通通擦掉。不过，正如我刚才所说的，她在还没有作出决断之前就死去了。如今，她家里的人把这幅画悬在她闺房里的床头上，每逢她的生日，还把许多鲜花挂到画上去。平时总是用一块小小的帷幔把它遮盖起来。画上这位年轻的妇人，她的脸儿似乎甜得很可爱，只不过胳膊太多了，我觉得一眼望过去，活像蜘蛛网似的。

这位年轻的小姐在世时有一本剪贴簿，她老是把《长老会观察报》上刊载的讣告、意外事故，以及虔心苦行的事例都剪下来贴上去，后面还附上她独出心裁所写的几行诗。反正她的诗写得很不赖。以下就是她写的一首诗，哀悼一个不慎落井溺亡的男孩子，他的名字叫斯蒂芬·道林·博茨：





痛悼己故斯蒂芬·道林·博茨[10]





斯蒂芬说起来年纪还小，

难道说他真的病逝魂销？

人们有没有伤心落泪，

送葬时哭得死去活来？





不，年纪轻轻的斯蒂芬啊，

命里注定绝不会如此这般；

虽然人们都为他伤心叹气，

他的夭折与百病毫无关系。





既没有百日咳使他形销骨立，

又没有麻疹留下红瘢讨人厌；

绝不是这些病症不治，

让斯蒂芬的英名长逝。





啊，满头鬈发的年轻人，

既不是失恋酿成祸因，

更不是胃穿孔大出血，

才让斯蒂芬弃世而去。





不，如今我道出个中原因，

你姑且睁开泪眼先听我言：

他之所以遽然命赴黄泉，

只因为不慎失足堕深渊。





待到人们赶到把他捞上来，

让他吐尽积水为时太晚了；

他的英魂已飞往九霄云外，

极乐世界哪能不流连忘返。





埃米琳·格兰杰福特还不到十四岁，居然能写出这样的好诗来，那么，她只要不死，往后会达到什么境界，也就用不着多说了。巴克说，她一作诗就能朗朗上口，真可以说，得来毫不费工夫。她简直是不假思索，出口成诗。他说，她随便涂一下就是一行诗；她万一踅摸不到跟这一行押韵的诗句，就马上把它涂掉，另涂一行，如此这般继续写下去。她并不算特别挑剔，随你要她写什么，她也都会写的，只要是伤心的事就可以。每逢某某男人死了，或是某某女人死了，或是某某孩子死了，她总会在他们尸骨未寒以前把她的“悼诗”写好了。她管那些诗叫作悼诗。街坊邻居都说，头一个到的是医生，紧接着就是埃米琳，最后才是殡仪馆里的人——殡仪馆里的人从来不抢在她前头的；不过，有一回她因为要押死者惠斯勒的韵，耽误了好些时间，所以就破天荒迟到了。从那次以后，她就完全变了样；她从来没叹过苦经，可是眼看着她日渐消瘦，没多久就死了。可怜的姑娘！我已经有好多回了，先是她的一些画惹我生气，继而使我不免对她有点儿讨厌，于是，我就情不自禁地来到她原先住的那个闺房，把她那本可怜的旧剪贴簿拿过来，尽情观赏一番。其实，我很喜欢那一家子人，连死者都包括在内，而且还不乐意让我们彼此之间存在任何芥蒂。可怜的埃米琳生前给所有的死者都撰写过悼诗，到如今她已玉殒香销，居然没有人给她写一点儿什么的，看来是有失公允。因此，我个人尽管搜遍枯肠，想写上一两首，但不知怎的还是写不出来。她家里的人把埃米琳的闺房拾掇得一尘不染，所有的东西还是照她生前所喜欢的样子一一置放在那里，而且从来没有人在那里就寝。那位老妇人还亲自照管这个闺房，尽管她家里有好些黑奴，她老人家常在这儿做做针线，而且时不时上这儿来念念《圣经》。

现在再看看我刚才所说的那个大客厅，窗子上挂着美丽的白色窗帘，上面绘着许多图画，有藤蔓满墙的城堡，也有到溪边去饮水的牛羊。还有一台旧的小钢琴，里头我想丁零当啷够闹猛；反正听着年轻的姑娘们唱《最后一缕情丝已断》，演奏一支《布拉格之战》乐曲[11]，那才是美不滋儿的呢。各个房间四壁都用灰浆刷过，地板上十之八九铺着地毯，整幢住宅外面也粉刷过。

这是一幢特大的住宅，当中有一大块空地方，也有屋顶和地板，有时晌午摆一张桌子在那里，该有多么凉爽、惬意。哪儿都比不上它了。更不用说这儿饭菜好吃，而又管饱！

第十八章


你知道，格兰杰福特上校是个绅士。他是个地地道道的绅士，他的一家人也跟他一样。老话说得好，他就是出身好；难怪道格拉斯寡妇也会说：不管是人也好，还是马也好，最要紧出身好；其实，人们从来也没有否认过她是我们镇上的头等贵族；甚至老爸也会动不动这样说，尽管他自己的身份地位比大鲇鱼高不了多少。格兰杰福特上校是个细高个儿，面色黑里泛白，一点儿血色都没有。每天早上，他都要把自己的瘦脸儿上上下下刮得光光的。他的嘴唇特别薄，鼻子孔非常细，高鼻子，浓眉毛，两只乌黑的眼睛深深地凹进去，也许你会说，赛过两个黑窟窿使劲地瞅着你似的。他的额角很高，头发乌黑挺直，一直垂到肩膀上。他的两只手又长又瘦；他有生以来天天都穿着干净衬衫，浑身上下则是一整套亚麻布制成的白色西装，白晃晃会刺伤你的眼睛。每逢星期日，他就另换一套带黄铜纽扣的蓝色燕尾服。他拄着一根顶端镶银的桃花心木手杖。他身上一丁点儿轻浮习气都没有，平时也从不大声说话。他待人和气极了——这一点反正你准会感受到的，所以不消说，你也就会跟他无话不谈。有时候，他粲然一笑，端的是好看极了；不过，当他身子一挺直，活像一根旗杆似的，并从他浓眉底下开始迸射出有如闪电般的目光时，你不由得首先想要爬到大树上去，随后再闹明白究竟是怎么一回事。他也用不着关照人们要注意自己的举止言谈——不管他到了哪里，人们总是对他毕恭毕敬。反正不拘是谁都爱跟他在一起；他差不多永远是一片阳光——我的意思是说，他始终让人觉得如沐春风似的。不过每当他霍地变成一堆乌云，阴下来半分钟，怪吓人的，那也就够你受的了；于是，一星期以内，什么事再也不会出差错了。

他跟那位老妇人早晨一下楼来，全家人都离座起立，向他们问好，定要等他们落座了，方才可以坐下。随后，汤姆和博布走到贮存名酒的餐具柜那里，调好一杯苦味药酒端给他，他手里就端着酒杯等着，直到博布和汤姆的酒也都调好了，这时，他们就鞠了一躬，说：“老爷，太太，请您多多吩咐啦。”随后，两位就稍微点点头，说：“真是罪过罪过。”于是，他们三个人都把酒喝完，接着博布和汤姆倒上一调羹水，跟他们平底杯里喝剩的一点儿白糖和威士忌酒或者是苹果白兰地酒搀在一起，递了过来给我和巴克，于是，我们也向这两位老人家举杯祝酒。

论年龄，博布最大，汤姆其次，都是身材高大的美男子，肩膀很宽，脸呈棕色，满头黑溜溜的长发，眼睛也是黑溜溜的。他们也跟那位老先生一样，从头到脚穿着白色亚麻布制成的衣服，头戴宽边的巴拿马草帽。

接下来再谈一下夏洛蒂小姐。她现年二十五岁，个儿高高的，好像有点儿傲慢不可一世；她在不动气的时候，可真是和气极了；反过来，她要是动气了，她的那副脸相准让你当场厥倒，活像他老爸似的。论长相，她还算漂亮。

她的妹妹索菲娅小姐，长得也很漂亮，不过是另一种类型。她温柔可爱，有如小鸽子似的；她的芳龄也只不过二十岁。

这里，每个人手下都有自己的黑奴侍候着——连巴克也有一个。我的那个黑奴整天价悠闲自在，因为我本来就不习惯让别人替我做事的。可是，巴克的那一个黑奴，一天到晚闲不住，老是疲于奔命似的。

以上就是目前这个府上所有的人员了，但在从前，人员比现在还要多——三个儿子，他们全都给人打死了；还有那位已故埃米琳小姐。

这位老先生有很多农场，有一百多个黑奴。有时候，一大批人骑着马，打从周围十几英里的地方来到这里，住上五六天，就在附近和河上吃喝玩乐，白天还到树林子里去跳舞、野餐，入夜以后回家开舞会。这些人多半是他们本家的近亲眷属。男客们随身都带着枪。说实话，那才是一帮子阔佬。

邻近还有另外一批贵族——约莫有五六家——八成儿都姓谢泼德逊的。他们有如格兰杰福特家族一样高贵显赫，有钱有势。谢泼德逊家族和格兰杰福特家族，合用一座轮船码头，那儿离我们的住宅大约两英里远；所以，有时候，我跟我们家里的一大伙人上那儿去，常见到许许多多姓谢泼德逊的，骑着骏马在那里溜溜达达。

有一天，巴克和我正到树林子里去打猎，蓦然间听见一匹马奔过来了。这时，我们正好在穿过那条大路。巴克说：

“快一点儿！直奔树林子呀！”

我们果然奔进了树林子，打从树叶子隙孔里往外窥视。过了一会儿，有个漂亮小伙子骑着马一路奔过来，瞧他那潇洒自如的坐姿，好像是个骑兵似的。他的那支枪平放在前鞍桥上。我早先是见过他的。他就是年轻的哈尼·谢泼德逊。我只听见巴克的枪在我耳边响了一声，哈尼的帽子马上就从头顶上掉下去了。他紧握着枪，冲我们藏身之处奔过来。我们一点儿也不迟疑。我们穿过树林子撒腿就跑。反正这儿树木长得并不茂密，所以我不时回过头去看看，以便躲开枪弹；有两回，我看见哈尼举枪瞄准了巴克；随后，他就骑着马原路回去——我估摸恐怕是踅摸他的帽子去了，但是我没法看见。我们一溜小跑奔回家去。那位老先生两眼突然放出了炯炯的光芒——我揣想多半是开心极了——没多久，他的脸好像又趋于平静，不动声色地说：

“我不赞成躲在灌木丛后面放枪。你干吗不去大路上放呢，我的好孩子？”

“爸爸，谢泼德逊家的人压根儿不去的。他们净爱放冷枪。”

巴克说着自己的这件事时，夏洛蒂小姐好像皇后似的，昂起脑袋听着，气得她鼻子孔不时翕动，两眼忽闪忽闪。那两个年轻的小伙子看上去怪不高兴的，但还是一言不发。索菲娅小姐的脸色一下子变得煞白，可后来一听说那个人并没受伤，她的脸色却又立时变过来了。

后来，我把巴克领到树底下玉米穗仓库，恰好旁无一人时，我就问过他：

“巴克，当时你想不想把他打死呀？”

“得了，那还用问吗？”

“难道说他亏待过你了吗？”

“他嘛，他从来也没亏待过我。”

“那么，你干什么要打死他呢？”

“没什么——只不过是为了世代族仇的缘故。”

“什么叫世代族仇？”

“怎么啦，你是在哪儿长大的？你怎么连世代族仇都不知道？”

“这个我从来都没听人说过——你就给我说说吧。”

“好吧，”巴克说，“世代族仇就是这么回事：有一个人跟另一个人吵架，却把后者打死了；接着，后者的兄弟也把他打死了；于是，双方的哥儿们都出动了，打群架；随后，那些堂表兄弟也都插进来了，——没多久，一个一个全都死光了，那时候世代族仇也就没了。不过话又说回来，这个全过程是很慢的，要经过很长的岁月。”

“那眼下这一次，也有了好长岁月了吗，巴克？”

“哦，我揣想是吧！那是在三十年前开始的，反正差不离就在那个时候，谁知道为了一丁点儿什么鸡毛蒜皮的事就闹腾起来了，于是只好打官司来加以解决；有一个人因为官司打输了，一怒之下就开枪把那个打赢了的人给毙了——他当然会这样干的，那还用问吗。不管是谁都会这样的。”

“当时究竟为了什么才闹腾起来呢——是为了争土地吗？”

“我揣想也许是——我可说不准。”

“那么，是谁先开的枪——是格兰杰福特家族的人，还是谢泼德逊家里的人？”

“老天哪，我怎么会知道？那是老早老早以前的事啦。”

“难道说没有一个人知道吗？”

“哦，是的，我想爸爸大概会知道，另外还有好几个老字辈的人；不过现在他们也不知道开头究竟干吗闹腾起来的。”

“巴克，当初打死过好多人了吗？”

“是啊——大出殡，看热闹，机会可多着哩。可是也不见得老是打死人的。爸爸身上就挨过好几颗大粒霰弹，可他满不在乎，因为对他来说，反正也没有增加多少重量。博布有好几回挨过猎刀，汤姆也有一两回挂过彩。”

“今年打死过什么人没有，巴克？”

“有是有的，我们这边死过一个，他们那边也死过一个。约莫三个月以前，我那个十四岁的堂兄弟巴德，骑着马正好从河那边的树林子里穿过，该死的，他真傻，身上什么武器都没有；到了一个僻静的地方，他忽然听见一匹马从他背后过来了；他回头一看，只见包迪·谢泼德逊老头儿，手里提着枪飞也似的追上来，他的满头白发却在大风中狂飞乱舞；巴德并没有从马上跳下来，躲进小树丛里，居然还自以为敌得过老头儿呢；于是，他们就势均力敌，不相上下，一老一少，一前一后，拢共跑了五英里多地，殊不知老头儿总是越跑越快，到最后巴德一看没辙了，只好停住了马。转过身来，这样，对方打来的枪眼就可以在前面了，你知道，于是，那老头儿赶紧奔过来，开枪把巴德打下马来。可是，老头儿他并不见得有更多机会纳福，因为不到一个星期，我们这边的人就把他给干掉了。”

“巴克，我估摸那老头儿是个胆小鬼。”

“我觉得他可不是胆小鬼。他一点儿也不胆小。谢泼德逊家族里的人，没有贪生怕死的人——一个都没有。在我们格兰杰福特家族里，也找不到一个胆小鬼的。你听着，有一天，那个老头儿跟三个格兰杰福特家族里的人干仗，一直坚持了半个钟点，结果是他打赢了。他们全都骑在马上；他却从马上跳下来，躲到小小的一个木料堆后面去，让马站在前面挡住子弹；可是，格兰杰福特家族的那些人还是骑在马上，围着老头儿又蹦又跳，子弹不停地向他乱射过来，他的子弹也不停地向他们乱射过去。最后，老头儿跟他的那匹马全都血淋淋地瘸着腿回家转；但是，格兰杰福特家族的这些人都得让人抬回家去——他们里头有一个早就死了，另一个转天也死了。不，伙计，你知道，如果说有人要想踅摸胆小鬼的话，千万不要到谢泼德逊家族里去白白地浪费时间，因为他们那个家族从来不出那种窝囊废的。”

到了第二个星期天，我们全都骑着马，到约莫有三英里远的教堂去礼拜。凡是男人随身都带枪，巴克也一样，他们把枪夹在两腿当中，或是靠墙根搁着，便于拿取。谢泼德逊家族里的人也这样。那天的布道，可真是太差劲了——净说兄弟般的友爱，以及诸如此类的无聊话；可是，不管是谁全都说布道好；他们在回家路上胡扯，还说什么虔信上帝，行善积德，神恩无涯，命里注定[1]等等，乌七八糟的一大套，我可不知道还有什么其他名堂；反正像那样糟得令人难受的一个礼拜天，我好像从来都没碰上过呢。

午饭过后个把钟头左右，大家全都打盹儿，有的坐在椅子上，有的回自己屋里去，这时候气氛沉闷得很。巴克和一条狗直挺挺地躺在草地上晒太阳，睡得很熟。我来到楼上我们的房间，也想小歇一会儿。我发觉那位可爱的索菲娅小姐正伫立在她闺房门口——她的闺房恰好与我们贴隔壁——她领我到她闺房里去，轻轻地把房门关上，问我喜欢不喜欢她，我说我喜欢她；她又问我愿意不愿意替她办点儿事，而且不许给别人说，我说我愿意。随后，她说她把自己的《圣经》给忘了，留在教堂里的座位上，而且还夹在其他两本书的中间，问我愿意不愿意悄悄地溜到那里去，给她取回来，而且对任何人都要一气不吭。我说我愿意。于是，我就溜了出去，悄悄地来到大路上；这时，教堂里也许只有一两头猪，此外已是空无一人，因为教堂大门没有上锁，盛夏季节，猪老爱躺在那些用半圆木料、平面朝上铺的地板上，贪图那里凉快。你要是留神的话，就能看出大多数的人都是出于万般无奈，才上教堂去的；但是猪可就不一样了。

我暗自思忖着，这事可蹊跷——一个少女为了一本《圣经》急出一身汗来，不消说，很不自然；所以，我就把这本《圣经》抖搂了一下，一张小纸条就掉下来了，上面用铅笔写着三个字：“两点半”。这时，我简直茫然不知所措，所以，我只好又把那张小纸条夹进书里去了。等我回到家奔上楼时，索菲娅小姐已伫立在她闺房门口等着我。她把我推了进去，就把房门关上了；随后，她仔细翻看了那本《圣经》，发现了那张小纸条，她一看完就喜形于色；我还来不及思索一下，她早已抱住我，紧紧地搂着我，说我是天底下最最好的孩子，还关照我莫要对别人说。一瞬间，她的脸儿涨得通红，两眼闪闪发亮，端的是漂亮极了。这时，尽管我已大惊失色，可是不管怎样，等我刚舒过一口气来，就问她那张小纸条上写的是什么；不料，她反问我有没有看过了，我说没有。她又问我小纸条上字迹认不认得，我告诉她：“不认得，木版印刷的还行。”随后，她就说那张小纸条只不过是一个书签，用来记住她书已念到哪里罢了；接下来她说现在我不妨去外面玩儿了。

于是，我就来到了河边，暗自寻思着这一件事。过了一会儿，我看见我的黑奴就在我后头跟上来了。等我们走得很远，看不见那幢住宅时，他回过头去，又往四下里张望了一下，这才奔过来说：

“乔治小少爷，你要是到那个沼泽地去，我可以指给你看一大堆水蝮蛇[2]。”

我心里估摸，这可真是咄咄怪事；昨天他早已说过了。他应该懂得：谁都不喜欢老是到处去踅摸水蝮蛇呀。他到底是在搞什么名堂呢？于是，我就说：

“得了，你在头里走吧。”

我跟在他后面走了半英里地，他着沼泽地走过去，水深齐到他的脚踝骨，接着又过了半英里地。我们来到了一小块平地上，那里地上是干的，长满了大大小小的树木和藤蔓。他说：

“乔治小少爷，你冲那儿走过去，只要几步路，水蝮蛇就在那儿。我早就看过了，压根儿不想再看啦。”

接着，他就着泥水走开，没多久给树木遮住了。我就跟着往里头走了一程路，来到一小块空旷地，约莫有一个卧室那么大，四周围都攀满了藤蔓，看见有一个人躺在地上呼呼大睡——哎呀，老天哪，原来他就是我的那个老吉姆！

我马上把他叫醒，原先我以为他又跟我见面，肯定会大吃一惊，但结果他并没有这样。他太高兴了，差点儿没哭出来，但他并没有大惊失色。他说那天夜里他跟在我后头游，我每一次喊叫声，他都听到了，可他就是不敢应答，因为他不愿意自己被人救上来，让他再去当奴隶。他说：

“我受过一点儿轻伤，不能游得很快，到后来我就远远地落在你后面了。你上了岸，我还自以为能在岸上赶上你，不用冲你大声喊叫。可是我一看见那幢房子，就开始放慢了。我已经离得老远，听不见他们跟你说的那些什么话——我害怕那些狗——但等到四下里又是寂静无声的时候，我就知道你已经进了那幢房子，所以，我就只好跑到树林子里去等天亮。大清晨，有几个下地干活的黑奴打从我身边走过，他们就领着我，指给我看这个地方，因为那儿到处都有水，那些狗就不会跟着我过来。每天晚上他们给我送来许多菜蔬，还把你的情况都告诉我了。”

“吉姆，你干吗不早点儿让我的杰克领我上这儿来呢？”

“得了，哈克，在我们还没策划好以前，就去惊动你，那是一点儿用处都没有的——可是话又说回来，现在我们好歹还不错。我一有机会，就去买些锅、盆跟吃食，到了夜里，我还在修补木筏——”

“吉姆，什么木筏呀？”

“是我们的旧木筏呀。”

“你的意思是说，我们的旧木筏当时并没有全部撞毁吗？”

“是的，没有全部撞毁。它很多部位给撞毁了——它有一头已被撞掉了——可是还不算太严重，只不过我们铺的盖的差不多全给丢光了。如果说我们在水里没有钻得那么深，在水底下也没有游得那么远，而且那天夜里并不是那么漆黑一团，我们也没有害怕得像老话所说的傻瓜蛋似的，那么，我们就包管看得见那排木筏。不过，当时没看见木筏，也算不了什么，好歹现在木筏已经全修好了，差不多跟新的一模一样，而且我们还添了好多新的东西，把丢失了的都给补上了。”

“哦，吉姆，那你是怎么又把那旧木筏弄回来的——难道是你把它打捞上来的？”

“那时我早已钻到树林子里去了，怎么还能把它打捞上来呢？不，我可没法把它打捞上来，正好几个黑奴发现木筏被这儿河湾里一棵水中隐树卡住了，他们就把它藏到柳树林当中一道小河里。他们在木筏应该归谁的这个问题上争吵不休，没多久这件事却让我听到了；于是，我告诉他们，木筏不属于他们中间的任何一个人，而是属于你和我两个人的，就这样解决了他们的争端；接着，我又问他们是不是打算把一个年轻的白人财产抢过来，藏起来。后来，我给了他们每人十个美分，他们就觉得非常满意，还巴不得漂过来几排木筏，让他们再发一点儿财。他们待我可好极了，这些黑人，不管我要他们给我办什么事，压根儿用不着再说第二遍，好宝贝。那个杰克就是个很好的黑人，而且还挺聪明。”

“是哪，他可聪明得很。他从来没告诉过我原来你就在这儿；他关照我上这儿来，是他要指给我看一大堆水蝮蛇。万一出了什么事，他也不会牵连进去的。他满可以说他压根儿没见到我们俩在一块儿，那也是实情。”

至于转天发生的事，我可不乐意多谈。我觉得还是不妨长话短说为好。破晓时我就醒了，本想翻过身再睡，这时我发觉家里怪安静的——好像谁都没有一点儿动静似的。那跟平日里大不一样。接着，我发觉巴克已经起来往外走了。于是，我就起了床，暗自纳闷下了楼——周围一个人也没有，四下里都静悄悄的。大门外也是一样。我心里琢磨：这到底是怎么回事呀？我在木料堆那里碰到了我的杰克，我就问他：

“这是怎么回事呀？”

他说：

“乔治小少爷，难道你还不知道吗？”

“不，”我说，“我可不知道。”

“嘿，索菲娅小姐私奔啦！真的跟人私奔啦。她在夜里不知什么时候出走的——谁都说不准是在什么时候——跟那个年轻的哈尼·谢泼德逊私奔结婚去了，你知道——至少他们是这样怀疑。她家里的人约莫在半个钟头以前——也许还要早一点儿——才发现的；我老实告诉你，他们就不失时机地赶紧抓起枪、骑上马，那么慌慌张张的样子，你可从来都没见过！她家里的女人也都跑出去，把本家亲戚叫起来，索尔老爷和他几个少爷们，握着枪、骑上马冲河边大路上头赶过去，打算逮住那个年轻小伙子，抢在他带着索菲娅小姐过河之前，就把他打死。我心里琢磨，眼看着他们就有苦头吃啦。”

“巴克没有叫醒我就走了。”

“哦，我估摸他可没有叫醒你。他们不打算把你都掺和在一块儿。巴克先生的枪里子弹上了膛，他自以为豁出去也得把一个姓谢泼德逊的逮回来。我揣想，在那儿谢泼德逊家族的人准定可多着呢；他要是真的碰巧的话，准定逮一个回来。”

我冲着河边大路上拼命奔过去。没多久，我听见了从远处传过来的枪声。待我来到轮船码头附近的贮木场和那个木料堆时，我就好不容易从矮树枝条和树底下穿过去，最后才算踅摸到一块好地方，于是，我爬到一棵棉白杨树的树杈子上去观看——我想那里是在子弹射程以外。在这棵棉白杨树不远处，有一排四英尺高的木材，开头我很想躲到它后头去，但结果我没躲过去，也许还算我运气呢。

有四五个人骑着马，在贮木场前那块开阔地上欢蹦乱跳，又喊又骂，打算逮住躲在轮船码头附近大木堆后头的那两个年轻小伙子——可他们总是不能得逞。不管是哪一个小伙子，只要从大木堆靠河的那一边露出自己身子来，马上就会挨上一枪。那两个孩子蹲在大木堆后头，背靠背，以便两边的动静都看得到。

没有多久，这些人既不乱跳，也不乱喊了。他们策马直奔那个贮木场；于是，年轻小伙子里头就有一个站了起来，打从大木堆上举枪一瞄准，对方一个人立即应声由马鞍上滚下来了。那边所有的人都跳下马来，抓住受伤的人，赶紧把他抬到贮木场那边去；就在这一刹那，两个年轻小伙子早已撒腿跑了。那些人还没有发觉的时候，他们已经离我所在的那棵大树只有一半路了。随后，那些人也看到了他们，立即跃上马紧追不舍。眼看着他们快要追上了，可最后还是扑了空，因为这两个年轻的小伙子早已溜之大吉；他们俩来到我这棵大树前的那一大堆木材后头躲藏起来，这么一来，他们又占了上风。他们里头有一个正是巴克，另一个是约莫有十九岁、身体细瘦的小伙子。

那些人横冲直撞了一会儿，就驱马离去了。等他们已经远去没影儿的时候，我就向巴克大声喊道，我在这里。开头，他听不出我从树上传过去的声音，真的让他吓得要命。随后，他关照我要仔细留神观看着，要是有人再过来，就得马上告诉他；他说，他们肯定还会搞什么鬼的——马上就会回来的。我真是恨不得离开那棵大树，可是我并没有跳下来。这时，巴克就开始大哭大骂，硬是说他和他的堂兄乔（就是那另一个年轻小伙子）定要补偿这一天的损失。他说他父亲和两个哥哥都给人打死了，还有仇敌里头两三个人也给打死了。他说谢泼德逊家族的人是先埋伏好了，让他父兄们上了圈套的。巴克说，父亲和哥哥他们本来应该等到自家人来了再说——因为谢泼德逊家族的人实力太强，他们招架不住。我就问哈尼和索菲娅小姐的事怎么啦。他说他们过了河已经逃之夭夭了。我得知这个消息，非常高兴；可是巴克因为那天他对准哈尼开了枪，却没有把后者打死——他那种悲伤欲狂的样子，我真的从来都没见过。

蓦然间，砰！砰！砰！三四声枪响——那些人都下了马，悄悄地穿过树林子，从后面赶过来了！这两个小伙子立刻纵身往河里一跳——他们俩都已受了伤——正当他们顺着水流往下游去的时候，那些人已沿着河岸奔过来，对准他们开枪，还大声嚷道：“打死他们，打死他们呀！”这让我心里难过极了，我差点儿没从树上摔下去。我不打算把这件事的全过程都说出来——要不然会让我心里又难过极了。我真的巴不得那天夜里我压根儿没有爬上岸来，没看到这些事该有多好。可是这些事我不知怎的在脑海里永远也摆脱不了——有好多回我还梦见过。

我待在大树上，一直等到天黑才敢下来。有时候，我听见从树林子远处传来的枪声；还有过两回，我看见一小拨一小拨的人持着枪，骑着马，打从贮木场那边疾驰而去；所以，我心里估摸，这场灾难还将持续下去。这时，我心情非常沉重；我下决心今后自己再也不走近那幢房子了，因为我自己知道在这件事上，不管怎么说，反正都得怪我不好。我揣想，那张小纸条的意思，就是约好索菲娅小姐在两点半钟某某地方跟哈尼碰面，随后双双出走了；我想，本来我应该把那张小纸条的事，还有她那鬼鬼祟祟的神态，通通禀告她的父亲，那时，也许他老人家会把她锁在家里，而这种骇人的混乱局面也就绝不会出现了。

我从树上一爬下来，沿着河岸蹑手蹑脚地没走多少路，就发现那两具尸体漂浮在靠河沿的浅水里，我费劲地拖着拖着，最后总算把他们拖到岸上来；随后，我就把他们的脸儿都盖住，尽快离开了那个地方。我在给巴克的脸儿盖住的时候，还哭泣过一会儿，因为他待我确实是好极了。

现在，天刚黑下来。我压根儿再也没有走近那幢房子，只是穿过了树林子，径直往那沼泽地走去。当时，吉姆不在他藏身的那个小岛上，所以，我赶紧直奔那条小河，从柳树林里使劲往前挨挤，恨不得一跳上木筏，立时离开那个鬼地方——哪知道我们的木筏早已没影儿了！我的天哪，我一下子给吓昏了！我差不多有一分钟没喘过气来。随后，我就大吼一声。有一个声音在离我不到二十五英尺的地方，说：

“天哪！原来是你呀，小乖乖？可不要乱嚷嚷了。”

原来那是吉姆的声音——再也没有别的什么声音让我听着这么开心了。我沿着河岸一溜小跑了一会儿，就跳上了木筏，吉姆他一把抓住了我，他见到了我，确实高兴极了。他说：

“上帝保佑你，小伢儿，我真的觉得你一定又死了哪。杰克曾经来过这儿，他说他估摸着你早已给人打死了，因为你再也没有回到家里来；所以，我刚才正撑着木筏到小河口去，等杰克一回来跟我说你的确是死了，那时我马上就撑着木筏，离开这里。天哪，见到你又回来了，我可真的是高兴极了，小乖乖。”

我说：

“得了——那可敢情好；他们找不到我，他们就满以为我早已给人打死，被河水漂走了——河的上游那边有一些东西，会更加容易引发他们这样的想法——所以，你可别再磨磨蹭蹭了，吉姆，你现在尽快撑着木筏，开到大河里去吧。”

我心里一直感到七上八下，等到这排木筏往南走了两英里，开到密西西比河当中时，我们就扯起信号灯来，自以为这时我们又安全、自由了。从昨天起，我连一口东西都没吃过；所以，吉姆端出来好几块玉米饼和酪乳，还有猪肉、白菜和青菜——天底下再也没有比它们更好的吃食了，因为它们做得太好了——我一边吃晚饭，一边跟吉姆闲扯，真是开心极了。我因为自己躲开他们的世代族仇而感到非常高兴，吉姆也因为自己离开沼泽地而同样感到高兴。我们说，千好万好，归根到底，还是以木筏为家最好。看来别的地方都是挤得难受，简直让人闷死了，可是木筏上却不是那样。你在木筏上会感到非常自由、安逸、舒适。

第十九章


两三个昼夜一晃就过去了；我觉得不妨可以说好像是漂过去了，而且又是那么安静地、平稳地、极妙地溜过去了。先说说我们打发时间的方式：那是一条大河，流到这儿，特别让人害怕——有时河面宽达一英里半；我们常常昼伏夜行；眼看着黑夜差不多过去了，我们就停航，把木筏拴起来——几乎老是泊靠在一个沙洲后头的死水里；从棉白杨和柳树上砍下一些嫩枝条把木筏掩盖起来。随后，我们往河里撒下一些钓鱼丝线。接下来就悄悄地到河里游泳，给自己梳洗一下，凉快凉快；然后，我们就在河水刚没过膝盖的沙滩地上坐下来，等着黎明来临。四下里一点儿声音也没有——真是静极了——好像整个世界都睡着了，只是偶尔有几只牛蛙，也许会鼓噪一下。从水面上眺望远处，首先映入眼帘的，是隐隐约约的一道轮廓——那就是河对岸的树林子——除此以外，你什么东西都看不清楚；随后，天上有一小块地方泛白；接着越来越白，逐渐向四周围蔓延；于是，这条大河远处色彩柔和，已呈现灰亮色，再也不是黑糊糊的一片了；你能看到远远地漂流着的一个个小黑点儿——那是平底驳船，以及诸如此类的船只；还有好多又黑又长的条形物，不消说，那就是木筏了；有时候，你能听见一把长桨在咯吱作响；或是一阵阵喧闹声，因为四下里都很静，所以声音可以传得很远；过了半晌，你能看见水面上有一道纹路，一看那纹路的样子就知道那儿有一棵水中隐树，在湍急的河水冲击之下，就形成了那么一道纹路；你还可以看到轻雾从水面上腾起，东边红了，河面上也红了，在河对岸远处的树林子边沿上，你还可以看见一小间木头房子，大概是一家木栈，原是他们那伙骗子故意堆放成这样，你不管从哪个地方都能把一条狗扔得进去[1]；随后，一阵微风拂面吹来，它是从河那边冲你吹过来的，那么凉爽、新鲜，又因为那边花木繁茂，还可以闻到淡淡的清香味儿。但有时候也并不都是那样，因为有人扔下了许多死鱼，诸如颚针鱼那一类的，已是满地狼藉，腥臭极了。最后，你终于挨到了大天亮，整个世界在阳光中微笑，那些燕雀也闹腾得真欢啊！

这时候，稍微升起一点儿炊烟，人们是不会注意的，我们就从钓鱼丝线上摘下几条鱼来，做了一顿热乎乎的早餐。后来，我们两眼看着孤寂的河面，怪懒洋洋的，没多久也懒洋洋地睡着了。过了半晌，一觉醒来，抬眼看看那是怎么回事，也许你会看见一艘轮船扑哧扑哧地开过来，因为它离河的对岸很远，只能看出它的水轮装在船尾，两边也有，除此以外，什么也都看不清楚。约莫有个把钟头，什么声音都听不见，什么东西也看不见——只有一片凝固的孤寂。随后，你会看见打从那边远处漂浮过来一排木筏，也许有一个没经验的年轻水手，正在那上面砍劈柴——因为他们差不多老在木筏上干这种活儿；你会看见斧光一闪砍了下去——可是一点儿响声都听不见；你要看到那斧子又给举了起来，直到举过了那个人的头顶，方才听得到咔嚓一声——那个声音是要在水上经过很长时间才传过来的。所以，我们只好从静寂中听声音，懒懒散散地把白天给打发过去。有一回，我们遇到了大雾，那些从我们身边经过的木筏和小船上面，都一个劲儿敲着洋铁皮盆盆罐罐，提醒大轮船别把它们给撞翻了。一条商用平底驳船或者是一排木筏跟我们挨得很近开过去，我们听得见他们在闲聊和笑骂的声音——听得一清二楚，可是他们的影儿却偏偏看不见；这真的使你觉得毛骨悚然，赛过有鬼在空中乱吵乱闹似的。吉姆说他相信那一定是有鬼；可我还是说：

“不，鬼是不会说：‘这该死的大雾真该死。'”

天刚黑下来，我们马上撑离岸边；我把木筏差不多撑到河心时，就不管它了，我们让它随着水流漂去；随后，我们就点起烟斗来，让两条腿垂在水里悬荡着，天南地北地神聊起来——不管是白天黑夜，只要蚊子口下留情的话，我们老是赤裸裸，一丝不挂——巴克家里的人给我做的那些新衣服，都太帅了，穿着反而怪不舒服。再说，我也不太喜欢穿衣服呗。

有时候，整条大河上下只有我们两个，待在那里时间也最长。在水那边的远方是河岸和几个小岛；也许还有一星点儿火光——那是小木屋窗子里燃着蜡烛——有时候还可以看见水面上一两点火花——那就是木筏上或是平底驳船上的，你知道；也许你还能听到一阵阵拉提琴或是唱歌的声音，从里头的一只船上飘过来。在木筏上过的生活，真是美极了。我们头顶上空是满天的星星，我们常常躺在木筏上，仰望着天上的星星，谈论着它们是造出来的，还是偶尔出现的——吉姆认为它们是造出来的，可我认为它们还是偶尔出现的；我揣想要造那么多的星星，那得耗去多长时间？吉姆说它们可能是月亮下的蛋；得了，那倒像是有点儿道理，所以，我就一点儿没有表示反对，因为我看见过一只青蛙差不多也下过这么多，月亮当然也能下那么多。我们还常常看从天上掉下来的星星，看着它们划出一道亮光往下坠落，吉姆估摸这些蛋都是坏了的，所以让月亮从窝里给扔了出去。

一夜之间，我们总有一两回看见一艘轮船在黑暗中悄悄地行进，不时从大烟囱里喷出来满天火花星子，像雨点似的洒落在河里，端的是好看极了；随后，它一拐弯儿，它的灯光就看不见了，嘈杂的谈话声也听不见了，让这条大河再次安静下来；等那艘轮船开过去已有老半天了，它破开的层层碎浪才慢慢向我们翻滚过来，把木筏轻轻地摇颠着，从此以后，你也不知道要经过多长时间，一点儿声音都听不见，除了也许偶尔传来一两声蛙鸣。

半夜以后，岸上的人们全都入睡了，于是有两三个钟头，河岸上一片漆黑——再也看不到小木屋窗子里一闪一闪的亮光了。其实，那些亮光就是我们的时钟——只要一看到头一个再次露出来的亮光，就知道黎明快要来临了，所以，我们立时就去踅摸躲藏的地方，把木筏拴好。

有一天凌晨，差不多快要天亮的时候，我找着了一只小划子，就横过一股湍急的窄水道，冲着最大的河岸划过去——只不过两百码远——随后沿着一条两旁长满翠柏的小河，往上游划了大约一英里路，打算看看自己能不能踅摸到一些浆果。当我正要经过一条跨过小河、赛过放牛娃常走的小道时，忽见两个人慌慌张张地冲着这条小道狂奔过来。我觉得这回我是大难临头了，因为不管是什么人追什么人，我总觉得那就是追我——或者也许是追吉姆。我赶紧操起桨离开那儿，可他们已经逼近我了，他们大声喊叫，乞求我救他们一命——说他们从来没做过什么坏事，可偏偏有人在他们后头紧追不舍——说是有很多人，带着不少狗，转眼就要追上来了。他们想要马上跳到小船上来，可是我说：

“不准上船。我还没有听见马嘶狗吠的声音哩。现在，你们还来得及，快从那个小树林里挤过去，沿着小河往上走一程路；然后，跳到水里去，再游到我这儿来上船——那样一来，就让那些狗嗅不到人的味儿了。”

他们就听了我的话去做了。等他们一上小船，我就飞也似的冲着我们的那个沙洲划过去，约莫过了五分钟或者十分钟，我们听得见那些人带着狗在远处大声喊叫。我们听得见他们朝着小河一路过来，但就是看不见他们；看来他们驻足不前，只是在那里闲逛了一会儿；随后，我们就越走越远，他们的声音几乎一点儿都听不见了；待我们把那长达一英里的树林子甩在后面，到达大河时，已是万籁俱寂，我们就操起桨划过了河，到达沙洲后，躲藏在棉白杨树丛里，这时总算是平安无事了。

再说说这两个家伙，里头有一个约莫有七十岁，也许还要大些，头顶上光秃秃的，嘴边留着白花花的胡须。他戴着一顶破破烂烂的阔边毡帽，身穿一件油腻腻的蓝色羊毛衬衫，和一条破旧的蓝色斜纹布裤子，裤腿掖在靴筒里，裤子上原有两条家里制作的吊带——不，他只剩下一条了。他的胳膊上挽着一件破旧的蓝色斜纹布长尾外套，上面钉着晶光锃亮的铜纽扣，他们两个随身都带着鼓鼓囊囊的破旧大号毡制手提包。

那另一个人大约在三十岁上下，身上穿着差不多也是不堪入目。早饭过后，我们大家都歇着闲聊天，没想到头一件露馅儿的事，就是：这两个家伙原来相互都不认识。

“你惹的是什么麻烦来着？”那个秃顶对那另一个家伙说。

“我是一直在卖一种去牙垢剂——我的这种玩意儿去牙垢特别灵，往往连牙齿的珐琅质一块儿都掉下来——可是，我千不该，万不该，却在那儿多住了一宿。我正要滑脚开溜的时候，却在小镇这边的小道上碰到了你，这时你对我说他们正在后头追过来，求我帮你把他们甩脱掉。我就对你说，我可自身难保，真不知道多咱会碰上麻烦，所以倒也愿意跟你一块儿四处乱跑。我惹的祸就是这样——那你惹的是什么祸来着？”

“哦，我在那里推行戒酒复兴运动，差不多已有个把星期了；那里的娘儿们，不管是老是少，都特别爱听我演讲，没有一个不拥护我的，因为我狠狠地给了那些酒鬼一点儿颜色看。我老实告诉你吧，我一个夜晚就能挣到五六块金币——票价每人十个美分，孩子和黑人都用不着买票——这个买卖居然一天比一天红火；真不知道是怎么回事，昨儿晚上有人在谣传，说我经常偷偷地喝酒解闷儿。今天早上，有个黑人把我唤醒了，并且告诉我，说有很多人骑着马，带着狗，暗地里集合在一起，马上就要出发；他们打算让我先跑半个钟头，随后，如果说他们可能的话，再把我甩在后头；又说，他们要是抓住了我，肯定把我浑身涂满柏油，再插上羽毛，并且把我放在杠上抬着示众[2]。我并没有等到吃早饭就开溜了——我也压根儿不知道肚子饿了。”

“老头子啊，”那个年轻人说，“我想我们两个就合伙干吧；你觉得怎么样？”

“那对我来说，可正中下怀啦。你干的是哪一行——顶呱呱的？”

“论行当，我是个印刷工，打短工，做一天算一天；有时也做一点儿成药买卖；还在戏院里登台客串过——专门演悲剧，你知道；偶尔再来两下子催眠术和看颅相面；在学校里也教过唱歌和地理，不外乎是想换换环境罢了；有时候，干脆来上一场演说——哦，我干过的行当可多着呢——多半看哪个便当就干哪个，所以也说不上是正业。那你是靠什么混饭吃的？”

“我是一向行医的，论年头，还真不算少哩。我最拿手的是把手按放在病人的患处，给人治病——诸如癌症跟瘫痪等等；我给人算命，真是神极了，可我总得踅摸个把人替我先把底摸清楚。说到传教，我也是里手行家；什么野营布道会啦，到各地巡回传教啦，样样内行。”

好半天他们谁都是一言不发；随后，那个年轻人叹了一口气，说：

“哎哟哟！”

“你哎哟哟个屁呀？”那个秃顶说。

“唉，一想到我活到现在，竟然会过上这种日子，怪丢人现眼的，跟你们这帮子人厮混在一块儿。”说罢，他拿来一块破布头开始擦自己的眼角。

“你这该死的家伙，跟我们一块儿厮混，对你还不是够好的吗？”那个秃顶语言辛辣、态度傲慢地说。

“是呀，对我是够好的；这是我自作自受呗；想当年，我是高人一等，是谁让我一落千丈地跌下来的呢？原来是我自个儿呗。我并不怪你们，诸位——绝不会怪你们的；我谁也不怪。我呀活该如此。让这个冷酷的世道有什么招数尽管使出来吧；反正有一件事我是知道的——那儿有一块墓地在等着我呢。这个世道尽管像过去那样胡作非为，把我所有的东西全都抢走——我的亲人，我的财产，以及所有一切通通抢光——可它断断乎不能把我的那块墓地也给抢走。我总有一天会躺在坟墓里，把这一切通通忘掉，到那时我这颗可怜的、破碎的心，也就早该安息啦。”他继续不停地在擦自己的眼角。

“让你的那颗可怜的、破碎的心见鬼去哟，”那个秃顶说，“你干吗举起你那颗可怜的、破碎的心，朝着我们乱扔过来呀？我们可没有招惹你呀。”

“是的，我知道你们没有招惹着我。我也绝不会怪你们，诸位先生。是我让自己跌落下来的——是的，都是我自己造的孽。如今我受罪，是活该如此——活该如此——绝不会唉声叹气。”

“你是从哪儿让自己跌落下来的？那么，你原来是什么样的身份地位？”

“嘿，恐怕你们听了也不会相信；世界上谁都不会相信的——随它去吧——没什么了不起。我的身世秘密——”

“你的身世秘密！？你的意思是说——”

“诸位先生，”那个年轻人不苟言笑地说，“我这就向你们公开地说了吧，因为我觉得我对你们还算信得过。按理说，我原是一位公爵。”

吉姆一听到他这句话，眼珠子都鼓出来了；我想我自己也是一样。随后，那个秃顶就说：“不！你可不是这个意思吧？”

“得了。我的曾祖父是布里奇沃特公爵的长子，大约在上个世纪末，他逃到我们美国来，原是为了呼吸一点儿纯净的自由空气。他是在这里结婚成家，死后留下一个儿子；他自己的生父差不多跟他是同时故世的。这位已故公爵的次子，把爵位跟家产都夺过去了——那位真正的公爵年纪还很小，反而被丢在一边不管了。我本人就是那位幼小的公爵的直系后代——我本人就是合法的布里奇沃特公爵。可是如今我流落在这里，孑然一身，孤苦伶仃，我的显贵家业都被抢走了，这些姑且先不谈；这个冷酷的世道还瞧不起我，弄得我走投无路，破衣烂衫，筋疲力尽，怪丢人现眼的，跟你们这帮子哥儿们一块儿厮混在木筏上！”

吉姆觉得他真的是太可怜了，我觉得也是这样。我们千方百计安慰他，但他说那可没有多大用处，他断断乎不会感到多少安慰；他说只要我们愿意承认他的公爵身份，那就比别的什么对他更有好处；所以，我们就说我们愿意承认，只要他把怎么个做法关照我们好了。他就说，以后我们跟他说话时，应该俯首称呼他“大人”，或是“阁下”，或是“爵爷”——如果说不带衔头，招呼他布里奇沃特，他也不会介意的，他说那反正是个爵衔，并不是名号呗；开饭时，我们就得有一个人专门伺候他，听从他随时吩咐。

这一切都好办，所以我们就照办不误。午饭时，吉姆自始至终站立在一侧，专门伺候着他，还不时说：“请大人吃一点儿这个，好不好”，或是“请吃一点儿那个，好不好？”如此等等，谁都看得出来，这些话让那位爵爷听了真够美滋滋的。

但是没有多久，那个老头子默不作声了——他不大爱说话了，他对我们围着公爵巴结，仿佛怪不舒服似的。看来他心里有好些话想要说说。所以，到了午后，他就说：

“比奇沃特[3]你听着，”他说，“我真为你难过死了，不过，碰到那样灾难的人，并不是独独只有你一个人。”

“是真的吗？”

“那还用问吗？并不是独独只有你一个人。反正从上头给人拉了下来的，并不是独独只有你一个人。”

“哎哟哟”

“身世的秘密，也并非仅仅你一个人才有吧。”天哪，他也开始呜咽哭泣起来了。

“别哭呀！你这是什么意思？”

“比奇沃特，你这个人我能信得过吗？”老头子说，依然有点儿抽抽噎噎的。

“要不然就不得好死呗！”他抓住老头子的手，紧紧地握了一下，说，“你的身世秘密？快点儿说呀！”

“比奇沃特，我是法国皇太子！[4]”

我敢说，吉姆和我这回可傻眼了。随后，公爵就说：

“你是什么呀？”

“是的，我的朋友，此时此刻你两眼正瞧着那位可怜的、失踪了的皇太子——路易十七，也就是路易十六跟玛丽·昂托内的儿子，那可也是千真万确的。”

“你呀！瞧你这个岁数！断断乎不可能！你的意思是说你就是已故的查理曼大帝[5]吧？那么，你少说也得有六七百岁了。”

“患难催人老，比奇沃特，患难催人老；患难使我先是白发满头，接下来是未老先秃了。是的，诸位先生，不妨睁开眼睛看看，在你们眼前的这个身穿蓝色斜纹布裤子的穷鬼，原来就是那流离颠沛、漂泊异国、遭人践踏、受苦受难的、合法的法兰西国王。”

说罢，他号啕大哭起来，悲伤欲绝，让我和吉姆简直不知怎样才好，我们真的难过极了——可我们心里又感到喜滋滋的，因为我们毕竟有幸跟他陛下在一起。所以，我们就像刚才对待爵爷那样，千方百计也想要安慰安慰他。殊不知他说那都是白搭，除非他六根清净，无忧无虑地撒手西归，不管是什么也不会给他带来任何好处；不过，他倒是这么说过，只要人们让他享受到合法国王应有的待遇，跟他说话时要一条腿下跪，开口闭口地称呼他“万岁”, “万岁”，开饭时先要侍奉他，当着他的圣颜，他不叫你坐下，你就得一直站着，如果说以上各项都落实的话，他也许暂时会有一丁点儿悠然自得。所以，我跟吉姆就万岁、万岁不离口地称呼他，给他做了这个再做那个，而且整天价老是站在一侧，等到他有了吩咐才敢坐下。这样做对他着实有不少好处，所以，他常常露出乐呵呵、怪舒服的样子来。可是话又说回来，那位爵父却讨厌他，对眼前事态仿佛非常不满；尽管这样，国王对他还表示真的非常友好，说爵爷的曾祖父和所有姓比奇沃特的公爵，当年都备受他父王的恩宠，经常让他们到皇宫里去；可是那位爵爷待在那儿好半天不吭气，到后来国王才又开口说道：

“比奇沃特，看来我们大伙儿在这木筏上，要待上该死的一年半载的，你又干吗老是这么动不动就怄气呢？这只能使什么事都怪别扭的。我生来不是公爵，这不好怪我；你生来不是国王，那也不怨你——既然如此，那你又干吗自寻烦恼呢？我常常说，要随遇而安——这就是我的处世之道。说到底，我们一块儿到这个地方来，可也不赖——吃的东西多得很，而且过的又是松心的日子——喂，把你的手伸过来，爵爷，让我们交个朋友吧。”

公爵果然依着他的话做了，吉姆和我目睹了此情此景，满心感到喜悦。那种不愉快的氛围，立时烟消云散；我们对这件事的结局都深感满意；因为要是在同一座木筏上大家不能和睦相处，这才真的是一件苦透了的事；在一座木筏上，首先要求每个人都要心满意足，对待别人也要得体、和气。

从这以后没有多久，我敢肯定说，这些吹牛大王，压根儿不是什么国王，也不是什么公爵，只不过是一些卑劣的花招和骗人的鬼话罢了；但我从来都是一言不发，永不泄露；把它牢记在心里，才是上策；那你既不会跟人吵嘴，也不会惹祸。他们让我们称呼他们国王、公爵，我们并没有反对，只要我们大伙儿能够平安无事就得了；反正告诉吉姆也没有什么用处。所以，我就没有跟他说。如果说我跟老爸从来没有学到过别的什么的话，毕竟我还是学到了一些：要跟这帮子人周旋，不外乎让他们随心所欲——这就是最好的办法。

第二十章


他们问了我们很多问题，想要知道为什么我们把木筏那么严丝合缝地遮盖起来，为什么大白天不赶路，反而躲起来——难道说吉姆是一个逃跑的黑奴吗？于是，我说：

“我的老天哪！一个逃跑的黑奴还敢往南方跑吗？”

不，他们料定他是不敢的。可我好歹还得说出个所以然来，因此我就说：

“我家里的人都住在密苏里州派克郡，那就是我的出生地。后来全家的人都去世了，只剩下我和老爸，还有我的小弟弟艾克。老爸他认为自己应该离开老家，到大河下游跟本叔叔住在一块儿。叔叔在新奥尔良[1]以南四十四英里的大河边上，有一小块土地。老爸一贫如洗，还背了一些债；后来他总算把债都还清了，那时就只剩下了十六块美元和我们家的黑奴吉姆。那么几个钱，要远行一千四百英里，不管是打统舱票，还是另想别法，都是远远不够的。有一天，老爸不知怎的碰上了一点儿小运气，他把这一段木筏给截住了，所以我们就坐上这木筏顺水而下，开到新奥尔良去。可是老爸的运气毕竟长不了；一天夜里，有一艘轮船竟把木筏前头的一个犄角给撞翻了，于是，我们一家人全都落水了，深深地沉到了机轮底下；吉姆和我好歹都浮上来了，可是老爸喝醉了酒，艾克是个刚满四岁的小娃娃，所以，他们俩落水后再也没有冒上来了。接下来一两天里，我们碰上的麻烦够多的，因为人家老是出动小艇追过来，想要把吉姆带走，说他们深信不疑吉姆就是一个逃跑的黑奴。所以说，现在我们大白天再也不赶路了；入夜以后，人家就不会来打扰我们啦。”

那个公爵说：

“得了，我来出个好点子，好让我们在大白天想要赶路，就能赶路。这件事可得仔细琢磨琢磨——琢磨出一个万无一失的办法来。今天我们先搁下不去谈它，因为大白天我们当然不能从那边小镇开过去——那样做是要不得的。”

快到夜晚的时分，天色开始变得阴沉起来了，看上去像要下雨；闪电在天边低处闪光四射；树叶子也开始颤动起来了——不难看出，这种势头将是怪骇人的。所以，公爵和国王都去检查我们的窝棚，看看我们的床铺究竟行不行。我床上铺的是干草垫褥——比吉姆那条玉米穗壳的垫褥要稍微好一些；玉米穗壳的垫褥里头，常有许多玉米棒子芯掺杂在一块儿，而且还会戳出来扎人；你要是在它上面翻个身，那些干枯玉米穗壳就会响起来，好像你是在一堆干枯树叶子里打滚儿似的；它只要窸窸窣窣一响，准把你吵醒了。公爵心里很想睡我的床铺，可是国王偏偏不答应。他说：

“我觉得既然我们俩头衔不一样，你就会想到：让我去睡玉米穗壳垫褥总是极不合适的。还是贵大人自己去睡那床玉米穗壳垫褥吧。”

吉姆和我又心急火燎了一会儿，深恐他们两个之间惹起更多麻烦来；所以，一听到公爵下面这些话，我们简直乐不可支——

“我命里注定：我一辈子都在铁蹄压迫之下，身陷泥沼，不能自拔。我当年那种目空一切的傲气，都让倒运给冲掉了；我屈从，我认输；我也就认命了。我在这个世界上孤零零一个人——让我去受罪吧；反正我能顶得住。”

天一黑下来，我们就立时开拔了。国王关照我们尽量沿着河当中走，要开过那个小镇老远了才让掌灯。不久，我们看见了一小簇亮光——这就是那个小镇，你知道——我们悄悄地走了大约半英里，总算还很顺当。我们往南再走过了四分之三英里时，才把信号灯挂起来，约莫到了十点钟，就刮风下雨了，而且还有轰雷闪电，够骇人的；于是国王吩咐我们两个在外面值班，直到天气好转为止；说罢，他跟公爵都爬进窝棚歇夜去了。接下来我要值班到深夜十二点；不过，我即便有一个铺位，反正也不乐意进去歇夜的；因为像眼前这样的狂风暴雨，在一个星期里未必天天都会看得见，断断乎不会的。我的天哪，这一股风怎么会如此这般呼啸而过！每隔一两秒钟，就迸射出一回耀眼的闪光，把周围半英里地以内波峰迭起的白浪都给照得雪亮；透过雨帘，你会看到那些小岛好像变得灰蒙蒙似的，大小树木都在狂风中拼命挣扎；接下来就听到哗啦、哗啦的声音！——还有咕隆、咕隆的声音！咕隆、咕隆、咕隆、咕隆、咕隆——这轰雷就咕隆、咕隆地越滚越远，没多久听不见了——接着，天空中划过又一道闪光，以及随之而来的大霹雳。有好几回，汹涌奔澎的大浪差点儿把我从木筏上冲走，反正我身上没穿衣服，所以也就满不在乎。即使是那些水中隐树，也没有给我们增添什么麻烦，因为凭借四下里忽隐忽现的闪电，我们对水上动静都能看得很真切，不紧不慢地让木筏前端拐过来或者拐过去，及时躲开那些障碍物。

你知道，我本该值半夜里的班，不料到了那个时辰，我早已打瞌睡了，所以，吉姆说他愿意替我值那头上半个班；他对我始终是那么体贴入微，吉姆的确就是这样。我就爬到窝棚里去，但是国王和公爵都四肢摆平地睡在铺上，所以我连一点儿栖身地方也没有，就只好在窝棚外头了——反正淋点儿雨，我是无所谓，因为天很暖和，那时浪头掀起来也还不算很高。不过约莫到了两点钟，浪头却大起来了，吉姆本想把我叫醒，可他转念一想，觉得浪头不算太高，还不至于碍事；殊不知他完全估计错了：真的说时迟那时快，蓦然间好大的一个浪头把我冲到河水里去。这一下子让吉姆差点儿没笑死了。反正像他那样哈哈大笑的黑人，我真的还没见过。

接着，我就值夜，吉姆一躺下来就鼾声大作；不一会儿，这场暴风雨好歹停住了，后来一看到岸上小屋里露出来的头一个灯光，我就立时把他叫醒，我们悄悄地把木筏藏到一个隐蔽的地方，为了躲过这个大白天。

早饭过后，国王掏出来一副邋里邋遢的旧扑克牌，跟公爵玩了一会儿接龙[2]，每回有五个美分的输赢。后来他们玩腻了，说他们打算“制订”一个按他们的说法叫作“作战方案”的东西。公爵就从他的毡制手提包里掏出来一大沓铅印小传单，大声地一一念道。有一张传单上说：“巴黎赫赫有名的阿芒·德·蒙塔班博士”将在某月某日、某某地方，作“关于颅相学的讲演”，入场券每人十美分，“备有颅相特征图表，每份二十五美分”。公爵说那个博士就是他自个儿。在另一张传单上，他摇身一变，成为“伦敦德鲁里巷享有世界声誉、扮演莎士比亚悲剧的大师小加里克[3]”。在别的一些传单上，他还有许许多多别的名字，以及许许多多别的惊人的绝招，比方说，用“神杖”就可以找出活水和黄金来，并能“驱魔避邪”，如此等等，不一而足。过了一会儿，他说：

“不过，说到底，登场做戏，那才过瘾哪。国王陛下，您登过戏台子没有？”

“没有。”国王说。

“那么，落难的王公大人，您在三天以内，准得登台亮相，”公爵说，“我们只要到了头一个像模像样的市镇，就租一个场子，演一回《理查三世》[4]里头的击剑，跟《罗密欧与朱丽叶》[5]里阳台上那场戏。您觉得怎么样？”

“比奇沃特，凡是能赚钱的事，我哪能不动心呢；不过，你知道，我对演戏是一窍不通，连看也看得不多。父王当年在宫里倒是常看戏，就怨我那时岁数还太小。你觉得你能教教我吗？”

“反正便当得很！”

“敢情好。我正想要翻一点儿新花样呢。让我们马上就开始吧。”

于是，公爵就告诉他罗密欧是谁，朱丽叶又是谁，还说他自己历来是演罗密欧的，所以国王不妨演朱丽叶就得了。

“可是话又说回来，既然朱丽叶是个年轻的姑娘，那我这个秃头白胡子，说不定会把她演成一个丑八怪呢。”

“不会的，你别犯愁啦——这些乡巴佬断断乎不会想到那个。何况那时你还得穿上戏装呢，你知道，那可就完全变了；朱丽叶没去睡觉以前，正在阳台上赏月，那时她身上穿着睡衣，头上戴着带褶裥的睡帽。你瞧，这儿就是扮那些角色穿的戏装。”

他捧出来两三套印花窗帘布做的戏装，他说这是理查三世和另一个角色[6]穿的中世纪盔袍，此外还有一件白棉布长睡衣，以及跟它配套的一顶带褶裥的睡帽。国王看了心里很满意；于是，公爵就把他的脚本拿出来，一边极其夸张地念台词，一边昂首阔步地排演走台子，让大家看看这出戏该怎么个演法。过后他把脚本交给国王，关照他把他自己那个角色的台词背下来。

在河湾以南约莫三英里的地方，有一个小不点儿的市镇。公爵饭后说刚才他想出一个点子来了，往后不但可以大白天赶路，而且对吉姆还丝毫没有危险。所以，他认为他该到这小镇上去，安排这件事。国王说他也想去，看看自己能不能碰上什么好运气。再说，我们的咖啡早已用完了，所以吉姆说我最好也跟他们坐着小划子一块儿去，买点儿咖啡回来。

我们来到了小镇上，一个行人都看不到，大街小巷空落落的，死气沉沉，寂静无声，就像礼拜天一样。我们在一个后院里瞧见一个患病的黑人在晒太阳，他说，镇上所有的人都到树林子后头约莫两英里的野营布道会上去了，只剩下那些老弱病残和小不点儿没有去。国王打听清楚方向地点以后，说他想要去那里，不管好坏，那个野营布道会该利用一下，又说我也可以跟他一块儿去。

公爵说他想要踅摸的是一家印刷所。我们果然踅摸到了一家：铺子门面小得很，是在一爿木匠店的楼上——所有木匠和印刷所里头的人，全都到布道会上去了，店门却没有上锁。那是一个又脏又乱的地方，墙壁上到处是一块块油墨，还贴着各式各样的传单，上面画着好多马和在逃的黑人。公爵把外套脱下来，说他这会儿可正中下怀了。所以，我和国王就跑了出来，踅摸那个野营布道会去了。

约莫半个钟头以后，我们赶到了那个地方，已是汗流浃背的，那天可真炎热得邪门。有多达千把人从方圆二十英里以内各地赶来这儿开会。树林子里到处都拴满了骡马和大篷车，这些骡马一边在车槽里吃草料，一边尥着蹶子赶飞蝇。有许多用杆子搭架、树条枝盖顶的棚子，里面什么柠檬水和姜饼，以及一堆堆西瓜、绿壳嫩玉米和这一类的吃食都有卖的。

有人正在同样的棚子里讲道——只不过这些棚子大一些，里面可容纳更多的人。这里的板凳是用劈开的圆木平面那层厚板做成的，在它底下凸圆的那一面钻上几个孔眼，装上一些棒棍，充当凳腿。它们都没有靠背。通常传道士都站在棚子那一头高高的讲坛上。娘儿们都戴着遮阳女帽；有的穿着亚麻羊毛交织的长衣裙，有的穿着方格子条纹布长袍，还有一两个年轻的姑娘穿着印花细布连衣裙。年轻的小伙子里头有的光着脚丫子，有一些小孩子除了一件短纤维亚麻布衬衫以外，身上别的什么也没有。有好几个老太太正在打毛线，还有一些大男大女正在偷偷地谈情说爱。

我们来到了头一个棚子，那位传道士正在领唱一首赞美诗。他一唱完两句，大家就跟着唱起来，听上去倒是很雄壮，好像这里确有这么多的人，唱得又是这么带劲儿；随后，他又领着大家唱了两句——就这么着一直唱下去。瞧，这些人精神越来越亢奋，唱得也越来越响亮，唱到最后的时候，有些人仿佛在发出哼哼声，有些人却像在大声呐喊。那时，传道士就开始讲起道来；他还是一板一眼地讲呀讲的；他先是摇摇晃晃地往讲坛这边走过来，接着又是摇摇晃晃地往讲坛那边走过去，随后却让身子冲着讲坛前弯下来，他的两条胳膊和身躯一直不断在摇晃着，他讲的话儿都是声嘶力竭地喊出来的。他时不时把《圣经》先是举起来，接着又把它摊开来，有点儿好像要递过去给大伙儿看看，他一面又大声嚷嚷地说：“这就是旷野里的铜蛇！一看它，就活了！”[7]讲坛下那些人接着高声嚷道：“荣耀啊！阿——阿门[8]!”他就这么着喊下去，那些人也就一边在发哼哼声，一边大哭大叫，还一迭连声说：阿门——

“哦，快到前排供忏悔者坐的板凳或座位上来吧！过来吧，罪孽深重的人们！（阿门！）过来吧，得病引起痛苦的人！（阿门！）过来吧，瘸腿跛脚的人，还有瞎了眼的人！（阿门）过来吧，蒙受奇耻大辱的人们！（阿——阿门！）所有疲惫的、堕落的、受苦受难的人们，全都过来吧！——带着你们破碎了的灵魂走过来吧！带着你们悔罪之心走过来吧！穿着你们破衣烂衫、带着罪恶和下流话走过来吧！涤罪的圣水不要钱，天堂的大门永远敞开着——哦，进来吧，安息吧！”（阿——阿门！荣耀啊，荣耀啊，哈利路亚[9]! ）

就是如此这般地说下去。你再也听不出那位传道士说的是什么了，因为都被大哭大喊的声音盖过去了。在这大庭广众，到处都有人站了起来，耗尽最大力气挤到前排供忏悔者坐的板凳式座位上，泪水却从他们脸上淌下来；等那一大群忏悔者拥到前排的板凳上一坐下来，他们就大声唱歌，大声叫嚷，并且还扑倒在前面的草地上，简直全都疯了。

是的，我一眼就看见国王赶过去了；你听得出他的喊叫声比谁都高亢；接着，他一个箭步就登上了讲坛，传道士请他对大伙儿讲讲话，他果然讲起话来了。他告诉大家，说他原来是个海盗——他在印度洋上当海盗已有三十个年头了，去年春天干了一仗，他手下弟兄们数目大大地减少了，现在他回到老家来，打算招募一些新人出去。多亏昨儿晚上他遭到抢劫，从轮船上被撵到河岸上来，身上连一个子儿都没有，尽管这样，可他还是很高兴，觉得那是他一生中所碰到的最幸运的事，因为现在他已经洗心革面，变成一个新人了，这是他有生以来头一遭感到快活；他穷虽然穷，但他还是打算马上动身，靠一路上挣点儿钱回到印度洋去，要在他那后半辈子里尽心尽力，去规劝那些海盗改邪归正，因为他跟那个大洋里头那帮子海盗都很熟悉，这件事让他来做，自然要比任何人做更理想了；尽管他手头没有钱，回到那里去肯定要有很长一段日子，可是，不管怎么样，他铁了心，也非得回去不可；赶明儿每当他劝说的结果使一个海盗心悦诚服的时候，他就要跟这个海盗说：“你不要谢我啦，也不要以为这是我的功劳啦；说真的，这一切都要归功于派克郡野营布道会上亲爱的人们，他们才真的是人类的亲兄弟、大恩人——还有那边那位亲爱的传道士，他不愧为一个海盗有生以来最忠实的朋友。”

说罢，他却突然痛哭流涕起来了，大家也都跟着痛哭流涕。那时，有人大声嚷着说：“给他募捐一点儿吧，给他募捐一点儿吧！”于是马上就有五六个人跃跃欲试，可是也有人大声嚷着说：“让他自己拿着帽儿挨个儿敛吧！”接着，大家个个都这么说，连传道士也这么说。

于是，国王陛下拿着帽儿在人群里头穿来穿去，一边擦眼睛，一边给大家祝福，并且赞美他们，感谢他们，因为他们对海外那帮子可怜巴巴的海盗，居然如此大发慈悲；每过一会儿，最标致的大姑娘们里头，就有好几个粉颊上还淌着泪珠，站起来问他肯不肯让她们亲吻一下，做个纪念；这时，他总是有求必应，落落大方地让她们一一亲吻；有好几个大姑娘把他搂住，一连亲吻了竟达五六次之多，接着，又请他在这里小住一个星期；不拘是谁全都争着邀他到自己家里去住，还说他们觉得那是一件光荣的事；不料他说，这既然是野营布道会最末的一天，他再住下去对大伙儿也不见得有什么好处，何况他正急着想马上赶回印度洋，早一点儿去感化那帮子海盗。

我们一回到木筏上，他就把敛来的钱算出个总数来。他发现总共捞进了八十七块七十五美分。他还顺手牵羊地捎回来一大罐威士忌酒，竟有三加仑重，那是他穿过树林子回家转的时候，打从一辆大篷车底下踅摸到的。国王说，总而言之，他这一天的进项，把他干传道这行当以来任何一天都盖过去了。他说，光是空口说大话不行，就是要讲好让布道会受骗上当的话儿，那些不信教的人倘若跟海盗相比，简直是微不足道。

公爵还一直自以为他的业绩很不赖，但等到国王回来一摆功以后，他也就不敢那么想了。他在那个印刷所里排了两块版，接了庄稼人两笔小生意——印的是马匹招贴——有四块钱进账。他还替那家报纸接了一批价值十块钱的广告，可是他说要是广告费预付的话，刊登这些广告只要四块钱就得了——所以，人们就照这么着办了。报纸的定价是每年两块钱，可是他说报费如果预付，每份只收半块钱，因此，按照这个条件他收进了三份报费；人家本想照老例交些葱头和薪柴抵作报费，可是，他说他才盘进这个字号，自己尽量压低了报价，所以一概现钱交易。他还排了一首短诗，那是他自己绞尽脑汁写出来的——一共有三节——这首诗念起来很动听，带一点儿伤感——诗的题目是：“好吧，冷酷的世界啊，砸碎这颗破碎了的心！”——他把版子全都排好了，却留在那里，以便随时印到报上去，而且刊出后也分文不取。他总共捞进了九块半钱，他说这是他辛苦了一整天才赚来的。

随后，他给我们出示他印的另一种小东西，那也是不收分文的活儿，因为那是他替我们做的。那上面画着一个在逃的黑人，肩上扛着一根木棍，木棍上头挂着一个包袱，底下这么写着：“悬赏二百元。”那上面所说的都是有关吉姆的，把他描写得完全合辙，说他是在去年冬天从新奥尔良以南四十英里的圣雅克种植园里逃出来，大概是逃往北方的，有人只要逮住他送回来，就可以领到这一笔赏金。

“得了，”公爵说，“过了今儿晚上，我们想要大白天赶路了，就可以大白天赶路。我们只要一看见有人走过来，就用一条绳索把吉姆手脚都给捆起来，放到窝棚里去，回头出示这张传单，就说：我们是在大河上游逮住了他，因为手头没有钱，坐不起轮船，所以跟朋友赊欠，才踅摸到这一小截木筏，开往下游去领赏。看来给吉姆戴上脚镣手铐，也许更逼真一点儿，只不过跟我们那套哭穷叹苦经不搭调了——那就好像给他佩戴了珠宝首饰一模一样。还是用绳索捆住他，是最合情合理了——这一着我们务必保持戏台子上常说的‘三一律’[10]才好。”

我们个个都说公爵这一着确实高明，往后大白天赶路，断断乎不会再碰上麻烦了。我们估算着那天夜里准能远远地开出去好多好多英里，尽管由于公爵在印刷所里搞的鬼闹得小镇上满城风雨，我们也都管不着了——到那时，我们想要快速前进，就快速前进了。

我们先躲着，老是不作声，一直到快十点钟了，才把木筏撑离河岸，悄悄地往下游溜去，远离那个小镇，直到一点影儿都看不见了，于是我们才把灯挂起来。

凌晨四点钟，吉姆叫我起来值班的时候，跟我说：

“哈克，依你看，我们一路上会不会再碰上一些国王呀？”

“不，”我说，“我看不会的。”

“那敢情好，”他说，“一两个国王我倒觉得没什么的，不过那也够受的了。那个家伙压根儿是个大醉鬼，这位爵爷比他也好不了多少。”

我发觉吉姆一直千方百计要叫他说两句法国话，好让他听听那种话到底是啥样儿的；殊不知他在美国住得太久了，又饱受了这么许多苦难，早就把法国话忘掉了。

太阳已升得很高了，可我们依然一个劲儿往前赶，还没让木筏拴靠。没有多久，国王和公爵都出来了，看上去有点儿灰溜溜的样子。可是，等他们纵身一跳，在河里游了一会儿以后，他们一下子就兴高采烈起来。早饭过后，国王就在木筏的一个犄角上落了座。他先把靴子脱下来，再把裤脚管卷上去，让两条腿挂在水里摇晃着，好不舒服。接着，他点燃烟斗，死记硬背他的那些《罗密欧与朱丽叶》的台词。等他背得滚瓜烂熟的时候，他和公爵两个人就在一起开始排练。公爵不得不一遍又一遍地教他每句话该怎么个说法。他还让他一边直叹气，一边用手按在胸前；不一会儿，他说他表演得很不赖，“只不过，”他说，“你千万别那么大声咆哮着喊‘罗密欧！’好像公牛在吼叫似的——你应该细声细气地轻轻吐出他的名字来，好像是有气无力、惹人爱怜似的，你好好听着，是这么着——‘罗——密——欧！’那才惟妙惟肖啦，因为朱丽叶毕竟还是个娇小可爱的少女，你知道，她断断乎不会像公驴似的干号着。”

随后，他们拿出来公爵用橡木板条制成的两把长剑，就开始排演击剑——公爵自称理查三世。他们在木筏上一忽儿声东击西，一忽儿龙腾虎跃的姿势，真的很有看头。可是没多久，国王摔了一跤，掉到水里去了；过后他们歇息了片刻，谈到了从前他们在河上碰见过的各种各样的惊险遭遇。

午饭过后，公爵说：

“喂，卡佩陛下[1]，你要知道，咱们可要把这出戏演得不同凡响，所以我估摸咱们还得往里头再添上一点儿什么东西。咱们也得事先想好一点儿什么节目，好应付台下喊着‘再来一个’。”

“比奇沃特，‘催来一个’是怎么个玩意儿？”

公爵告诉了他后，说：

“我打算就跳个苏格兰高地舞[2]，或是水手角笛舞[3]来应付一下吧。可是你呢？——哦，让我琢磨一下——哦，我琢磨起来了——你就不妨来上一段哈姆雷特的独白。”

“哈姆雷特的什么玩意儿？”

“哈姆雷特的独自道白，你要知道！那是莎士比亚戏剧里头最有名的精华。嘿，那可真的神极了！真的神极了！总是把全场观众都给倾倒了。可惜我这个脚本里头没有这一段——我这儿只有一册——不过，我估摸我大概可以从回忆中把它凑齐的。我这就来回溜达一会儿，看看能不能从我的天灵盖里把它召回来。”

于是，他就这么着来回地溜达起来。他全神贯注地在回想，时不时就皱紧眉头，真是怪可怕的；接着又让眉毛往上一扬，再用他的一只手紧紧地攥住脑门子，踉踉跄跄地往后退了几步，嘴巴里还在哼些什么的；随后，他叹了一口气，假惺惺地掉下了几滴眼泪。看着他那副德行真逗人。不一会儿，他回想起来了，他关照我们大家留点儿神。他就摆出一副非常高贵的派头来，一条腿往前迈了一步，两条胳膊高高地向上伸着，脑袋向后仰着，脸儿望着天；随后，他就开始满嘴粗话，口出呓语，咬牙切齿；反正他念的那段台词从头到尾，老是在那里大声吼叫，踅来踅去，挺胸凸肚，端的把我以前看过的所有演出全都盖过去了。这就是那篇独白——他一边教给国王听，我一边就记牢了，还算很容易呢：





活着呢，还是死去？就是这一柄小小的刀子

使人们甘心久困于灾难之中；

谁愿负着重担，直到勃南森林真的来到邓西嫩[4]，

可是心中对身后事怀有恐惧，

戕害了清白无辜的睡眠，

大自然里第二条必经之路，

使我们宁可抛出命运的暴虐的毒箭，

决不向我们所不知道的幽冥飞去。

为了这个缘故，我们必须踌躇：

敲门把邓肯[5]叫醒了吧，但愿你做得到；

谁愿意忍受人世的鞭挞和讥嘲，

压迫者的凌辱，傲慢者的冷眼，

法律的迁延，和他的惨痛所换来的宁静，

在荒凉死寂的深夜里，鬼魂都从坟墓里出来，

礼俗规定的黑色丧服，阴森可怖，

但是那从来不曾有一个旅人回来过的神秘之国，

正在向人世间吐放疠气，

因此刚毅的本色，像老古话里那只猫咪，

被忧虑蒙上了一层病容，

所有笼罩在我们屋顶上的阴云，

也因此改变了它们气流的方向，

失去了行动的意义。

这是值得虔诚祈求的圆寂。且慢！

美丽的奥菲利娅：

莫要张开你那笨拙的大理石嘴巴，

快到女修道院去吧——快去！[6]





那老头儿也很喜欢这一篇台词。他马上把它背熟了，所以念得顶呱呱，仿佛天生就有演戏的才能似的。当他学这一段独白的时候，他演得很投入，顶来劲儿，瞧他那满口秽语、眼泪汪汪、痛不欲生的样儿，真是妙不可言了。

我们头一件意想不到的事，就是公爵他马上印好了许多海报。后来，我们在河上漂流的那两三天里，这座木筏就成了一块非常热闹的场地，因为整天价没事可做，只有击剑和“彩排”——这是公爵所使用的词儿。有一天早上，我们顺流而下，来到了阿肯色州，看见一个大河湾那里有一个小不点儿的村镇；我们就在离上游不到一英里的小河口靠了岸，这条小河都被翠柏浓阴遮盖住，赛过一条隧道似的。除了吉姆以外，我们全都坐上小划子，开往小镇去，看看在那儿有没有演出机会。

我们真的很走运，那天下午恰好有个马戏团要在那儿表演，许许多多住在四乡的人，都坐着各式各样的破旧大篷车，或是骑着马儿赶到小镇上来。那个马戏团天黑以前就要离开那里，我们恰好赶得上在当天晚上演出。于是，公爵包租了法院的大厅，我们就到小镇上各处去张贴海报。海报上是这样印着：

随后，我们就在小镇上到处闲逛。商铺和住房差不多都是一些歪歪扭扭、干裂了的木框构架的陋屋，外面从来没有油漆过。这些陋屋都有离地三四英尺高的支柱撑着，河水泛滥时就不会被淹没了。住房周围都有一块块小园子，可是里面好像没种上什么东西，只有一些曼陀罗、向日葵、一堆堆炉渣、变了样的旧皮靴和旧皮鞋，还有一些破瓶子、烂布头，以及废旧洋铁皮器皿等等。这一带的围栅都是用各种不同的木板拼成，钉起来的时间也是有先有后，因此东歪西倒，很寒碜；围栅门上多半没安装铰链——只用一条牛皮带子拴着。有些围栅真不知道什么时候刷过白灰，不过公爵却说那大概还是在哥伦布时代吧。园子里常有一些猪闯进来，老是被人撵出去。

商铺全都开设在一条街上。每一家商铺门口，都支起一座家庭制造的遮篷，乡巴佬就把他们的马拴在遮篷的支柱上。遮篷底下堆放着许多装货用的空木箱，那些游手好闲的人整天价赖在上面，手里拿着巴洛牌小折刀，在空木箱上来回乱削，嘴里咀嚼着烟叶子，同时还在张口打哈欠，伸伸懒腰——真是好一伙流氓阿飞。他们通常头上戴着黄色大草帽，帽檐很宽像把伞，但身上是从来不穿外套或是背心。他们彼此称呼不是比尔，就是巴克，或是汉克，或是乔，或是安迪什么的。他们唠扯起来，总是慢声慢气，拖拖沓沓，还搀着好多骂人的脏话。这样的流氓可多着呢，在每一根遮篷支柱旁边，至少就有这么一个流氓歪靠着。他差不多老让两只手插在裤兜里，只有在借给别人烟叶子，或是搔痒的时候，才把手掏出来。人家听到他们之间整天价唠着的老是类似这样的话：

“汉克，给我一口烟嚼嚼吧。”

“不行——我自己只剩一口了。跟比尔要去。”

也许比尔会给他一口；说不定他也会撒谎，说他一口都没有了。这伙流氓里头有的穷得一个子儿都没有，连一口烟叶子也没有。他们嚼的烟叶子，通通是跟别人借的——他们会跟另一个同伙说：“我真巴不得你能借我一口烟嚼嚼，杰克，刚才我把自己最后的一口烟给了本·汤普逊啦。”——这分明是在说假话，几乎每回都是老一套——断断乎不会有人上他的当，除非是个陌生人。不过，杰克毕竟不是陌生人，所以他说：

“你给过他一口，是真的吗？你妹妹那个家伙奶奶的也给过他一口哩。莱夫·巴克纳，你把我借给你的那几口先还给我，那么，我再借给你一两吨都行，还用不着你补利息。”

“得了吧，有一回我已还过你好几口呢。”

“不错，你是还过我的——大概是六口吧。你借我的是从店里买来的板烟，可你还我的却是黑色压缩烟砖。”

从店里买来的烟是小块压扁的黑色板烟，可是这些家伙多半把生烟叶搓起来嚼。他们跟别人借烟时，通常不用刀子切割，索性把烟块放在两排牙齿中间，一边使劲儿用牙咬，一边用手撕扯，就这样分成了两个大小不一的半块。有时候，烟块的主人怪心疼地瞅着递给他的这一小半块烟，就会酸溜溜地说：

“得了，把你咬着的那块给我，这小半块你就拿去吧。”

这儿不管大街小巷，到处都是泥浆，没有别的，只有泥浆——像柏油一样黑的泥浆，有好几处差不多有一英尺深；反正到哪儿也都有两三英寸深。那些猪到处乱转悠，还呼噜呼噜地不断地叫唤着。你会看到一头满身泥水的大母猪带着一窝子小猪崽，懒洋洋地从大街上踱过来，躺在泥浆中乱打滚，行人只好都从它边上绕过去。它舒展身子躺下来，两眼闭上，大耳朵晃来晃去，让小猪崽吸吮它的奶，瞧它那种快活的样子，好像它是美滋滋领年薪似的。过了一会儿，你就会听到一个阿飞大声喊道：“嘻！伙计，过去咬它，小虎崽！”那头大母猪马上撒腿就跑，还尖声叫着，怪惨的，因为它的两只大耳朵都被一两条狗咬住不放，后面还有三四十条狗一齐追上来。那时，你会看到那伙流氓阿飞全都站了起来，看闹猛，还格格地大笑，一直到它们跑得没影儿了，喧闹声也听不见了，他们脸上才露出无比痛快的样子来。随后，他们又都返回原处待着，一直等到斗狗时再过来看看。不过，像斗狗这类事，断断乎不会给他们很大刺激，让他们浑身上下感到痛快——除非是给一条迷路的狗浇上松节油，点上一把火，或是在狗尾上拴一只洋铁皮锅子，看着它跑累了，断了气，这时也许他们才过瘾哩。

有好些靠河沿的房子，都朝着河面凸出去，好像弯腰打躬似的，差不多快要栽进河里去了。那里头的居民都已搬出去了。还有一些房子，因为一只墙角下的驳岸倒塌了，那只墙角也就悬在半空。不过有人还住在里头，实在危险得很，因为有时候一长条像房子那么宽的宅基，一下子就倒塌到河里去了。有时候，一长条宽达四分之一英里的地基沿着河岸开始坍塌，一点儿一点儿地往河里陷下去，只消一个夏天，就整个儿都陷到河里去了。像那样的小镇，就不得不往后面挪了又挪，挪个没完没了，因为河水永远在那里啃着它。

那天离正午时分越近，街上的车马就越来越稠密，而且还在络绎不绝地来到。一家老小都是带着午饭，从四乡赶过来的，所以就坐在大篷车上吃午饭。只见到处都有人在喝威士忌酒，我还看到过三起大打出手的场面。没有多久，有人大声嚷道：

“瞧，老博格斯来了[8]! ——他从乡下赶到小镇上，来过他那一个月一回的小酒瘾啦！瞧，他过来了，大伙儿快看呀！”

那些阿飞们看得出个个喜上眉梢了——我估摸他们惯常跟老博格斯逗着玩儿。他们里头有一个人说：

“我倒也纳闷，真不知道他这一回打算干掉谁。如果说在过去二十年中他把所有他打算干掉的人都干掉了的话，那么，他现在的名气也应该说是不小了。”

另一个人说：“我倒是巴不得让老博格斯来吓唬吓唬我，因为那么一来，我就知道自己一千年也死不了呀。”

博格斯骑着马儿飞也似的奔过来，像印第安人那样大喊大叫。他大声嚷道：

“快闪开，给我让道！我这是来打仗的，棺材就要涨价啦。”

他已经喝得醉醺醺了，摇摇晃晃地坐在马鞍上。他虽然年过半百，但是面色还很红润。大家全都冲着他大喊大笑，而且说话时还挖苦他，他也反过来挖苦他们，说往后轮到他们的时候，他要再来收拾他们，要他们的命；可是现在他一刻儿也耽搁不得，因为他这会儿到镇上来就是要干掉老舍伯恩上校的。他的口头禅是：“先吃肉，末了再喝汤。”

他看见了我，就策马奔了过来，说：

“孩子，你是打哪儿来的？你打算找死吗？”

说罢，他又往前飞奔而去。我心里害怕得要死；可是有一个人说：

“他倒是并没有什么恶意。他一喝醉了酒，常要开这样的玩笑。在阿肯色州，就数他这个老傻瓜心眼儿最好啦——不管他醉不醉，从来没伤害过人。”

博格斯骑着马儿来到了镇上最大的一家商店门口，低下头来，从遮篷帘子底下往店堂里瞧着，而且还大声嚷道：“舍伯恩，快快滚出来！滚出来，跟你诈骗过的那个人见见面。我来找的就是你这个狗东西，我还得要你的狗命呢！”

他就这么着破口大骂舍伯恩，凡是说得出口的，他全都骂到了。整条大街上挤得水泄不通，大家全都听着，笑着，数落着。过了一会儿，有个约莫五十五岁、趾高气扬的人——他还是那个镇上穿着最讲究的人——从那家商店里走了出来，于是，围着看热闹的人立时分立两旁，给他让路。他泰然自若地、慢慢悠悠地对博格斯说话——他说：

“这一套我早听腻了，可是，我还能够忍受到午后一点钟。忍受到午后一点钟，要记住——不再等了。过了一点以后，你只要再敢骂我一句，那么，不管你走到天涯海角，我也得把你踅摸到。”

说罢，他一转身就进去了。这一大群人看来脑子一下子清醒过来了；没有一个人乱走乱动，谁也不再哈哈大笑了。博格斯骑着马儿走到大街上去，没命似的大吼大叫，痛骂舍伯恩。过了一会儿，他又回来了，在那家商店门口停住，仍然没完没了，骂个不休。有好几个人走上去把他围住，劝他闭口，可是他偏偏听不进去。他们跟他说，大约再过十五分钟就到一点了，所以说，他务必回家去——他马上就得走。可是这都没有什么结果。他依然死劲儿破口大骂，还把自己的帽子扔到泥浆里，骑着马儿在它上面踩过去。过了一会儿，他又大嚷大叫地骂到大街上去，他那满头白发在背后飞舞着。凡是有机会跟他搭话的人，都竭尽全力地连哄带劝要他下马，以便把他关起来，让他头脑清醒过来，可是这些都不管用。——他从大街上再冲回来，又痛骂了舍伯恩一顿。不一会儿，有一个人说：

“去找他的闺女吧！——快呀，去找他的闺女就得了。有时候，他倒是肯听她闺女的话。要想把他劝过来，只有她行。”

于是，有人就一溜小跑找她去了。我往大街那头只走了一段路就停住了。过了约莫七八分钟，博格斯又过来了——可是这回没有骑马。他光着脑袋，跌跌撞撞地穿过大街向我走过来，他两侧都有一个朋友挽着他的胳膊，催着他赶快走。这时候，他默不作声了，看上去面有难色。他一点儿都没有踌躇不前，他自己也正在急匆匆往前赶。猛地有人大声喊道：

“博格斯！”

我往那边一眼望过去，想看看是谁在喊他，原来就是那位舍伯恩上校。他泰然自若地站在街上，右手举起一把手枪——他并没有专门瞄准谁，只不过是枪口朝天罢了。一刹那间，我看见一个少女连跑带奔过来，还有两个男人跟着她。博格斯跟那个人都掉过头去，看看到底是谁在喊他。那两个人一看见手枪，就往旁边闪开，这时候枪口慢慢地放下来，持平了——枪的双管都扳起了扳机。博格斯马上举起双手，说：“哎哟哟，老天哪！千万别开枪！”砰！头一枪打过去了，他就踉踉跄跄地往后退去，两只手在空中乱抓一气——砰！又是一声枪响，他身子就往后倾倒，笨重地摔在地上，两条胳膊向外伸展着。那个少女尖声地叫起来，就冲了过来，扑在她父亲身上号啕大哭，说：“哎哟哟，他终于把他打死啦，他终于把他打死啦！”那一大群人都簇拥过来，把他们团团围住，相互之间用肩膀推推搡搡，挨挤在一块儿，还伸长了脖子，想要看一看，而里面的人想要把他们撵回去，大声嚷道：“往后退，往后退呀！让他透透气，让他透透气吧！”

舍伯恩上校把手枪往地上一扔，就地来了个向后转，大步流星走开了。

人们把博格斯抬到了一家小药房[9]里，那一大群人照旧围着往里头挤，全镇的乡亲们都跟在后头。我就冲到前头去，在药房窗子外面找了块地方，在那里我离他挺近，往里头张望也挺清楚。他们把他平放到地板上，拿一本大部头《圣经》枕在他的头底下，还把另外一本《圣经》打开了，摊放在他胸脯上——不过，他们一开头就把他的衬衫扯开了，所以我看到了那颗子弹穿孔之处。他长嘘了大约十几口气，当他吸气的时候。那本《圣经》就被胸脯拱了起来，他吐气的时候，那本《圣经》却又落了下去——过后，他就躺在那儿，一动也不动了；他终于死了。他的女儿一边尖声喊叫，一边还在号啕大哭。人们把她先是拉开，继而带走了。她大概二八年华，长得挺俊，也挺文雅，可是脸色惨白，露出惊恐万状的样子来。

过了一会儿，全镇的人都到了，挨挨挤挤，推推搡搡，全想拥到窗子跟前看一看。可是那些早已占好地方的人，偏偏不肯让开，于是，站在后头的那些人，老在那儿嘀咕着说：“喂，喂，你们这伙人总该看够了吧；你们老不挪窝，也不让别人有机会实在太不公平，太不像话啦。别人都跟你们一样，也有权利一呀。”

站在前头的人马上顶嘴大吵一阵。我趁机开溜了，心里琢磨，也许又要出乱子了。各条街上人山人海，个个都激动极了。凡是亲眼目睹过这起枪杀惨案的人，都在讲述刚才发生的惨事的经过，在每一个讲述者的四周围，都有一大群人伸长脖子听着。有一个细高个儿、披着长头发的人，后脑勺上扣着一顶白色缎制高筒型大礼帽，拄着一根把手变了形的手杖，在地上一一标出当时博格斯站在哪里，舍伯恩又是站在哪里。大伙儿全都围着他团团转，从这一个地方转到那一个地方，一边全神贯注地看着他的一举手一投足，一边频频点头，表示懂得他说的意思，而且还弯着腰，两手撑在大腿上，看着他用手杖在地上一一标出那些肇事地点。随后，他就到了舍伯恩站过的地方，腰板挺直地站着，眉头一皱，把帽檐耷拉到齐眉处，大喊一声：“博格斯！”接着，让他的手杖慢慢地放下来，瞄准了，喊了一声：“砰！”他踉踉跄跄地往后退去，又喊了一声：“砰！”他就四脚朝天倒在地上了。凡是亲眼目睹过的人，都说他表演得呱呱叫，恰好跟刚才发生的情景一模一样。于是，就有十几个人掏出自己的酒瓶来，请他干一杯。

过了一会儿，有人就说应当给舍伯恩动私刑处死。大伙儿马上也都跟着这么说。于是，他们好像发疯了似的，一边喊叫一边走，见到晾衣服的绳子就扯下来，打算绞死舍伯恩时好派用场。

第二十二章


他们上了大街，一窝蜂似的拥向舍伯恩的住所，一路上大喊大骂，赛过印第安人一样。不管是什么东西都得闪开让道，要不然就被撞倒在地，踩得个稀巴烂，让人看了也怪害怕的。孩子们在这乌合之众前头拼命奔跑，尖声喊叫，想要躲开他们。沿途每一个窗口都挤满了娘儿们的脑袋，每一棵树上蹲着好几个黑人孩子，还有许多少男少女打从围栅顶上往外看，等这乌合之众差不离要冲到眼前，他们就赶紧散开，往后退去，离得老远老远的。有好多娘儿们和小姑娘都禁不住大哭大叫，她们几乎都吓得要死了。

他们一下子全簇拥到舍伯恩家的栅栏前面，真是里三层，外三层，挤得水泄不通，喧声沸天，使人什么也都听不见了。那是方圆二十英尺的一个小院子。有的人在大声喊道：“把栅栏拆掉！把栅栏拆掉！”接下来只听见一片乱拆乱砸、乱捣乱毁的骚闹声，于是那道栅栏也随之坍倒下去了；前头那一堵墙似的人群，就像一股巨浪冲进去了。

正在这时候，舍伯恩出来了，他手里提着一支双管枪，走到前面小门廊的屋顶上，泰然自若地伫立在那里，一句话也不说。那一片骚闹声立时停息了，有如潮涌的那些人也都退了回去。

舍伯恩压根儿一气不吭——只是伫立在那里俯看着。那种肃静的气氛，简直让人浑身起鸡皮疙瘩，怪别扭的。舍伯恩慢慢悠悠地把这大群人扫视了一遍；凡是被他扫视到的那些人，也都想瞪着眼把他顶回去，可他们还是没奈何他；他们只好让眼睛耷拉下来，露出萎靡的样子来。过了一会儿，舍伯恩就好像有点儿面露笑意，当然，他那种笑意不是叫人喜从中来，而是让人觉得如同嚼着一口搀上沙子的面包似的。

随后，他就慢慢悠悠地带着轻蔑的口吻说：

“你们竟然也想动私刑惩治人！那岂不是笑话？！你们竟敢胆大包天，动私刑动到一个堂堂男子汉头上来了！得了吧，你们那点儿胆量，只够捉弄流落至此地的那些可怜的弃妇们，比方说，给她们浑身涂满柏油，插上羽毛罢了；凭这个，你们自以为只要发个狠劲，就敢向一个堂堂男子汉行凶了吗？算了吧，一个堂堂男子汉就算落到一万个像你们这号人的手里，照样平安无事——只要是在光天化日之下，你们不是躲在他背后的话。

“难道说我还不认得你们吗？我早就把你们看透了。我是在南方长大的，后来一直住在北方，走南闯北，平头百姓是怎么个样儿，我都了如指掌。平头百姓都是贪生怕死的。在北方，一个平头百姓随便让人从他头上跨过去，他只好回到家里去做祷告，求上帝赐给他一副贱骨头，好让他逆来顺受。在南方，有一个人就在大白天，赤手空拳截住了一辆乘客爆满的公共马车，而且都给抢劫一空了。你们各家报纸拼命称赞你们是胆大如斗，你们就自以为胆量比谁都大——其实，你们胆量并不比别人家大，也只不过如此罢了。你们的陪审团为什么不敢把杀人犯都判处绞刑呢？就是因为他们害怕杀人犯的亲友们会在暗头里开枪打死他们——那伙人确实也会那么干的。

“所以，他们老是把杀人犯都给放走了。后来，有一个堂堂男子汉，深更半夜带领一百个戴着面罩的胆小鬼，赶去把那个坏蛋动私刑处死了。你们错就错在：你们压根儿没把一个堂堂男子汉带到这儿来，这是你们的头一个错。你们另一个错，就是错在：你们不是趁着黑灯瞎火的时刻来这儿，连面罩也都没带着。你们总共才带来了半拉个男子汉——就是那边的巴克·哈克尼斯——要不是他带着你们来，你们早就作鸟兽散了。

“说实话，你们压根儿就不愿意来。平头百姓，断断乎不愿惹麻烦、冒风险。你们也都是不愿意惹麻烦、冒风险。可是，只要有半拉个男子汉——就像那边的巴克·哈克尼斯——大声一呼：‘给他动私刑呀，给他动私刑呀！’你们谁也不敢往后缩回去了——生怕你们原形毕露——原是一帮子胆小鬼——所以，你们也就跟着乱喊乱叫，扯住了那半拉个男子汉的外套下摆不放，怒冲冲赶到这儿来，赌誓发咒地说你们非得露一手，大干一场不可。天底下再也没有比一帮子乌合之众更可怜的了；说到底，军队也一样——都是乌合之众；他们打起仗来，不是靠他们天生就有的勇气，而是全仗着人多势众，还有不少指挥官罢了。可是一伙乌合之众如果没有一条好汉牵头，那就连可怜都谈不上了。依我看，现在你们只好乖乖地夹着尾巴回家，钻进老窝里去吧。如果说你们真的打算动私刑惩治人的话，那就按照南方人的模式，在黑灯瞎火的夜里下手才好；来的时候，千万别忘了戴面罩，还有那条汉子也得一块儿捎来。现在，你们都给我滚开吧——连同你们那半拉个男子汉一块儿滚！”——他一边这么说着，一边把枪往上一提，搁在左胳膊上，子弹早就上了膛。

这一大群人突然像潮水似的往后退去，乱纷纷就朝四下里飞奔。那个巴克·哈克尼斯也跟在后头奔跑，看上去有如丧家之犬。我要是愿意的话，本来还可以待在那儿，可我就是不愿意再待下去了。

随后，我就跑到马戏竞技场那里去，先在场后面闲逛了一会儿，待看守的人走开了，打从帐篷底下钻了进去。我身边带着我那块价值二十美元的金币，还有另外一些钱，可是我觉得最好还是积攒下来，因为离家太远，人地生疏，这些钱说不准什么时候就用得着。还是谨小慎微为好。到了毫无办法可想的时候，我倒是不反对花钱看马戏，可是把这些钱浪掷在这上头，却是毫无必要。

那真是第一流的马戏表演，好看极了，我从来也没见过：他们成双配对，一男一女，肩并肩地骑着马儿进来了。男的只穿内裤和白衣，两脚既没有穿鞋，也不踩马镫，双手按在大腿上，多么潇洒自如——想必他们该有二十个人吧——女的脸蛋儿都很俊，模样儿也很标致——活像是一群实打实、靠得住的皇后，她们身上穿的服装，哪儿都缀满着钻石，价值好几百万哩。那种场面实在令人叫绝，我从来没见过那么好看的马戏。随后，他们一个个站立在马背上，围着圆形竞技场兜圈子，姿态那么轻盈、柔美、雅致，男的演员显得又高大、又挺秀，仿佛御风而行，与此同时，他们还频频点头，好像燕子从篷顶底下轻轻地掠过。那些女演员穿的玫瑰花瓣似的衣裙，兜住她们的肥臀，丝光闪闪地轻飘着，一眼望去，宛如一把一把惹人喜爱的小阳伞。

瞧啊，他们跑得越来越快，稍后，他们全都跳起舞来，先是一只脚举起在半空中，继而再举另一只；那些马儿越来越侧身歪斜，那个马戏团领班围着竞技场中间的柱子来回转，手执鞭子噼啪噼啪地直响，嘴里还大声喊道：“哈哎！——哈哎！”那个小丑跟在他背后，净说逗人发笑的话儿。不一会儿，所有骑手全都放下了缰绳，女的双手握拳扶着腰，男的两臂合抱在胸前，那些马儿侧身歪斜，迅跑得多带劲儿啊！临了，他们一个个从马上纵身一跃，落到竞技场内圈里，我从没见过他们那么别致地鞠了一躬，就欢蹦乱跳地出去了。所有观众立时鼓起掌来，简直高兴得如痴若狂了。

在这一场马戏表演里，他们自始至终展示了许多惊人的技艺；那个小丑老是在那里插科打诨，简直逗得大伙儿都快笑死了。马戏团领班对他还没说完一句话，他一眨眼就用一句最发噱的俏皮话给他顶了回去。至于他怎么会想得出那么多俏皮话，而且应答得又是那么出其不意，那么恰到好处，那是我怎么也闹不明白的。得了吧，反正那些话就算我想上整整一年也想不出来呀。没有多久，有一个醉鬼，想要闯进马戏竞技场里去——说他自己也想骑一下过把瘾，还说他的骑马术断断乎不会在某某人之下。他们就跟他吵起来，想要把他撵出去，无奈这个人偏偏不听话，结果，这一整台戏也只好暂停了。后来，不知怎的有人大声喊他，跟他逗着玩儿，这一下却惹他恼火了；他立时暴跳如雷，破口大骂。所以，他这么一闹，反而惹得大家都恼火了，有好多人当即离了座，一窝蜂似的簇拥到竞技场内圈里来，还大声嚷嚷说：“打倒他！把他扔出去！”有一两个娘儿们还开始尖声地喊叫起来。于是，这位马戏团领班就向大家简短地发话了，意思是说，他希望不要再乱吵乱闹了，如果说这个人一口答应不再捣乱了，那么，他倒是愿意让他骑一下，只要这个人觉得自己在马背上也能坐得稳就好了。殊不知这个醉鬼刚刚一上去，那匹马儿先是横冲直撞，继而绕着圈儿乱蹦乱跳，两个马戏团里的把式使劲揪着马笼头，想要把它制伏住，那个醉鬼却紧紧地抱住马脖子，随着马儿一纵一跳，他的两只脚丫子在半空中飞舞着，全场观众不由得站起来大喊大叫，哈哈大笑，差点儿连眼泪都流下来了。到了后来，尽管那两个马戏团里的把式费尽了九牛二虎之力，那匹马还是从羁绊中挣脱了，就拼命地冲出去，绕着竞技场内圈来回转，这时候，醉鬼却趴在马背上，死劲地搂住马脖子，先让一条腿从左边垂挂下来，几乎触及地面，稍后另一条腿又从右边垂挂下来，逗得大伙儿都像发了疯一样。可我倒是并不觉得可笑；眼看着他这么悬乎，我早已吓得浑身上下直哆嗦。幸好过了一会儿，他奋力一搏，就跨上了马鞍，攫住缰绳，不过，身子总是摇来晃去。紧跟着他纵身又一跃，撒开缰绳，终于站立在马背上了！那匹马也就死劲地狂奔，仿佛家里着火了似的。他高高地站立在马背上，简直是轻盈自如，飘飘欲仙，赛过这辈子他从没喝醉过似的。——随后，他就开始脱掉自己身上的衣服往上扔。他一件接一件飞快地扔着，满天空差不多都是他的衣服。他总共扔了十七套衣服。那时，你看，他站立在那里，挺秀，俊美，身上打扮得华丽、漂亮极了，反正你从来都没见过。这时候，他扬起鞭子朝马儿身上狠命抽，抽得它哼哼直叫。——末了，他跳下马来，鞠了一躬，手舞足蹈地直奔化妆室去了，大家看后无比惊喜，都拼命地狂喊起来。

直到这时，那个马戏团领班方才明白自己是受骗上当了。我觉得他可真是个懊丧莫及的领班。刚才那个家伙，原来就是他手底下的人！此人挖空心思想出来这一套把戏，从来都是秘而不宣的。唉，连我都会上了他的老当，真觉得怪窘的；不过话又说回来，我要是处在那个领班的地位，哪怕是给我一千块钱，我也不干。我可不知道有没有比它更出色的马戏团，反正我还没有见过。不管怎么样，依我看它是已经够好的了；不管是在哪儿，我只要再碰见它，我一定要惠顾它。

就在当天晚上，我们的戏也开演了。可是到场的总共只有十一二个人——收入刚刚够开支。那些人老是吃吃地笑个不停，可把公爵着恼了；而且，除了一个睡着了的小孩子以外，他们没等到演完就都溜走了。难怪公爵说阿肯色的这伙傻瓜蛋，压根儿看不懂莎士比亚的戏；依他看，他们要的是那种低级下流的滑稽节目——也许还是那些比滑稽节目更糟糕的东西。他们的口味，他说他算是摸透了。所以，转天早上，他拿出来好几张包皮纸和一点儿黑色颜料，画了好些海报，就到小镇上四处张贴起来。海报上写的是：

第二十三章


公爵和国王很卖力地忙活了一整天，搭戏台，挂幕布，还在台前装上一排蜡烛当作脚光。那天夜晚，大厅里一眨眼就爆满了。等到场内再也容纳不了的时候，公爵就扔下把门的事儿，绕到后头，来到戏台上，站在幕前，说了几句开场白。他对这一出悲剧赞不绝口，说它是举世罕见的、顶顶扣人心弦的好戏。他就这样把它吹嘘一通，回过头来再替老爱德蒙·基恩捧场，说他将在这一出戏里担纲出演主角。最后，他终于说得大伙儿心里痒痒的，净等着看好戏了。就在这一时刻，他把幕布往上一掀，只见国王四肢着地、一丝不挂地欢蹦乱跳出来了。他浑身上下涂满花花绿绿的颜色，再加上一圈一圈的条纹，真是鲜艳夺目，好像一道彩虹似的。至于他身上别的行头打扮，就更不用提了，简直是乱糟糟的，可也是真的够滑稽的。那些观众差点儿没给笑死了。国王在台上跳跳蹦蹦，胡闹得够了，就猛地蹦到幕后去了，人们一边叫嚷，一边鼓掌，像狂风暴雨似的震天动地闹腾着，一直到他又再出场，照原样重演了一遍；在这一回以后，人们还让他出场又跳了一回。那个老痴怪耍的鬼把戏，管保逗得一头母牛也会哈哈大笑了。

那时，公爵就让幕布落下来，朝着大家鞠了一躬，说这出大悲剧只能再演两个夜场，因为他们急于赶回伦敦去履约演出，现在英京德鲁里巷大剧院的坐票都已预售一空。随后，他又向大家鞠了一躬，说：如果他已经完成了寓教于乐这一任务的话，敦请观众们向他们诸亲好友介绍介绍，让他们都来看看这一出好戏，那他就向各位深深地表示谢意。

有二十来个人大声嚷嚷说：

“怎么啦，就算演完了吗？这样就算完了吗？”

公爵说是的。于是一下子掀起了轩然大波。人人都大声嚷嚷“上当了”，像疯了似的蹦了起来，打算朝着戏台和那两位悲剧名角冲过去。不料有一个身材魁伟、相貌不俗的人跳上了一条长板凳，大声喊道：

“诸位先生，且慢，且慢！先听我说句话。”于是，大家就都静下来听他说话。“我们上当了——是的，上了个老当呗。可是我觉得我们断断乎不能让全镇的人，老拿我们当作笑料，寻我们开心一辈子！这可要不得。那怎么办呢？我说，现在我们应该闷声不响地走出去，夸这出戏演得如何如何好，叫镇上其他的人也都来上上当！那么一来，我们大家彼此彼此，都是难兄难弟啦。这岂不是妙哉妙哉？”（“那当然行！法官说得就是有理！”大家全都这样大声嚷嚷说。）“那就好啦——关于上当的事，就一字不提啦。回家去，劝他们个个都来看这一出悲剧吧。”

到了第二天，你走遍全镇，听到的净是说那出戏演得如何如何精彩。当天晚上，大厅里再次爆满了，我们照样又让他们上了一回当。我跟国王和公爵回到木筏上，一块儿吃了晚饭。约莫到了半夜，他们关照吉姆和我把木筏撑到河心，顺水漂去，在离小镇两英里处靠岸，隐藏起来。

第三天夜晚，大厅里再一次爆满——这一回来的都不是新的观众，而是头两个夜晚来这儿看过戏的那些人。我紧挨着公爵站在大门口，只见每一个进场的人口袋里都装得鼓鼓囊囊的，有人在外套里头还兜着些什么东西——我一看就知道：那不是什么香水之类，断断乎不是。我闻得出大桶的臭鸡子和烂白菜一路货的臭味儿；你倘若问我那里头会不会有一头死猫，我也敢说准有，错不了——夹带东西进去的，一共有六十四个人。我挤了进去，只待了一会儿，各种不同的臭味扑鼻而来，让我受不了。等到场内再也容纳不了的时候，公爵给了一个人一块二十五美分硬币，叫此人替他看一会儿入场处大门，他就绕过通往戏台的小门走去，我尾随在他后面。不料我们一拐弯，来到了暗头里的时候，他就说：

“赶快走哪，等你远离小镇人家，就飞快地奔向木筏，好像有魔鬼追你似的！”

我果真就那么做了，他也是一样。我们两人同时来到了木筏上，不一会儿就顺水漂去。四下里黑糊糊，静悄悄。我们斜对着河心撑过去，谁都一句话也不说，我揣想：那个可怜巴巴的国王，在那些看戏的人面前肯定吃足苦头了；可是压根儿没有发生那种事。刹那间他从窝棚底下爬了出来，说：

“喂，公爵，这一回你玩的老把戏结果如何？”

原来他压根儿就没有到小镇上去。

我们摸着黑往那个村子以南走了约莫十英里，方才掌了灯，吃了晚饭。国王和公爵说起他们俩耍弄那些人的手法，全都笑得连骨头快要散了架。公爵说：

“净是一帮子容易上当的糊涂虫、傻瓜蛋！我早就知道，头一天看戏的人断断乎不会声张出去的，而是会让镇上其他人也来上当受骗。我知道，到了第三天晚上，他们一定会暗地里埋伏好，心想这可轮到他们下手报复来了。不错，是轮到他们了，可我倒是很想知道他们究竟捞到了多少便宜。我可真想知道他们究竟如何消磨这一大好机会。他们要是高兴的话，不妨就把它改成野餐会——反正他们随身带来了那么多的美味。”

他们这两个泼皮无赖，在那三个夜晚就骗到了四百六十五块金币。我从来没见过那么多的钱，多得简直要马驮车载哩。

不一会儿，他们全都睡着了，鼾声大作。吉姆说：

“哈克，他们这拨国王瞎胡闹，你不觉得大吃一惊吗？”

“不，”我说，“我不觉得大吃一惊。”

“那是为什么呢，哈克？”

“哦，这有什么大吃一惊的？因为他们在娘胎里就是这样。我觉得他们都是一路货。”

“可是，哈克，我们这儿的国王都是一伙地地道道的泼皮无赖；一点儿都不错，他们就是不折不扣的大流氓。”

“哦，这些话正是我想要说的，依我看，所有的国王几乎都是大流氓。”

“这是真的吗？”

“你只要在书上看见过一回——你就会知道了。你就看看亨利八世；倘若跟他相比，我们的这一位就像是主日学校校长哩。再看看查理二世，路易十四，路易十五，詹姆斯二世，爱德华二世，理查三世，还有别的四十来个；除此以外，还有那撒克逊七王国的国王们，想当年也曾飞扬跋扈，闹得个天翻地覆。嘿，你真该看看年轻时的老亨利八世，他可真是够罗曼蒂克啦。他惯常每天娶一个新媳妇，到了第二天早上就把她的脑袋砍掉。而且干这种事，他简直是面不改色心不跳，好像吩咐厨师煎两个鸡子似的。‘把内尔·格温带上来。’他说。他们就把她带上来。第二天早上，‘把她的脑袋砍掉！’他们就把她的脑袋砍掉了。‘把简·肖尔带上来。’他说；于是她就应命来了。第二天早上，‘把她的脑袋砍掉！'——他们就把她的脑袋砍掉了。‘按铃叫美人儿罗莎曼过来。’美人儿罗莎曼就应声而至。第二天早上，‘把她的脑袋砍掉。’每天晚上，老亨利八世他还让她们每一个人给他讲一个故事，日积月累，他就用这么个办法捞到了一千零一个故事，这时候，他就把它们编成一本书，书名叫作《末日审判书》——好一个书名，它一语道破了事实真相。吉姆，你看不懂那些国王什么的，可我把他们都看透了。依我看，我们的这个老泼皮，还算是有史以来最清白的一个国王呢。你看，亨利不知怎的突然来了个怪念头，竟跟我们美国捣乱来了。那么，他是怎么个着手的——事先打过一声招呼吗？——给过我们一个表白机会吗？不，全都没有。他突然把所有船上的茶叶，通通给扔到波士顿海湾里去，赶紧做好了一篇独立宣言，看我们还敢不敢怎么的。这就是他的作风——老是突如其来，叫人们措手不及。他对他父亲威灵顿公爵还疑神疑鬼呢。嘿，我说他是怎么着——要他露露面吗？不——他把他扔到一只大酒桶里，像一只猫似的给淹死了。假如说有人把钱掉在他身边——你说他会怎么着？顺手抓起来就拿走了。假如说你已把钱付给他，他应按约为你做一件事，但是你并没有待在一边看着他——你说他会怎么的？他准忙别的事，把你的事扔下不管。假如说他把嘴张开了——你说又会怎么啦？他要是不赶快闭上它，准会撒一回谎，每回都是这样。亨利就是这么一个骇人听闻的怪物。我们要是不跟我们的国王一块儿走，而是跟他亨利在一起的话，那么，他耍弄那个镇上的人肯定比我们那两位还要不像话呢。我并不是说我们那两位都是容易上当受骗的人——因为你一想到他们干的那些让人寒心的事实，就知道他们也不是好惹的。但是，不管怎么样，他们还是比不上那个老色鬼。我只不过是说，国王终归是国王，你总得对他们多多包涵。可是，全面地来看，他们都是一帮子万恶不赦的大坏蛋。他们从小就是受这样的教养长大的。”[1]

“可是，哈克，我们这个人身上有一股味儿，真该死的，难闻极了。”

“嘿，吉姆，他们个个都一样。反正国王身上有什么味儿，我们拿它也没有办法。自古以来，谁都拿它没辙啊。”

“说到那个公爵，他在有些地方还算是不太坏。”

“是的，每一个公爵都是各不相同。可也不是什么非常不同。我们这一个作为公爵来说，还只好算是一个中不溜儿的坏蛋。他喝醉了的时候，哪个近视眼也看不出他跟一个国王会有什么两样。”

“不管怎么样，反正我不再巴望这号人上这儿来了，哈克。眼前这两个就叫我够受的了。”

“我觉得也是这样，吉姆。不过，我们既然身边有了这两个家伙，就得记住他们都是什么人，只好多包涵些。有时候，我真巴不得听到哪一个国家是没得国王的。”

我要是告诉吉姆，说他们两个并不是真正的国王和公爵，那又有什么用呢？那也不会有什么好处；反正，我早就说过：你压根儿说不出他们究竟是真是假。

随后，我就睡着了，等到该由我值班的时候，吉姆也没有叫醒我。他老是那样做。天亮了，我才睡醒了，只见他坐在那儿，脑袋耷拉在两个膝盖当中，独个儿在唉声叹气。我故意不睬他，也不露声色。我知道那是怎么回事。原来他正在惦念着他远在大河上游的老婆孩子，他思家心切，情绪低落，因为他这一辈子都没离开过家。我相信他跟白人一样，也惦念着自个儿家里的人。这看似反常，可我想事实的确如此。入夜以后，他估摸我早已睡着了，那时候他还是少不了唉声叹气，咕哝着说：“可怜的小伊丽莎白呀！可怜的小约翰尼呀！让人难受死了！我揣想，我再也见不着你们了，再也见不着你们了！”吉姆是个好心肠的黑人，他这个人真的就是这样。

可是这一回，我不知怎的跟他谈到他的老婆孩子了。过了一会儿，他说：

“这回我心里觉得难受极了，因为刚才我听到那边岸上砰的一声响，好像是打人的，或者是关门的声音，让我回想起我那一回对待我的小伊丽莎白太粗暴了。那时她还不满四周岁，得了猩红热，被折磨得死去活来的，但后来她总算好了。有一天，她却站在那里，我就对她说：

“‘把门关上。’

“她怎么也不把门关上，只是站在那里，好像老是冲着我眯眯笑。这可把我气坏了。我就大声嚷嚷，又冲着她说：

“‘你听见了没有？——把门关上！’

“她还是照旧站着，好像仍然冲着我眯眯笑。我可真的恼火了！我说：

“‘该死的，我非得让你听我的话不可！’

“我一面这么说，一面照她的脑袋掴了一个巴掌，掴得她满地爬滚。随后，我走进了另一个房间，在那里待了约莫十多分钟。等我走回来一看，那扇门还开着，那孩子站在门口，两眼直瞅着地上，抽抽噎噎地哭着，泪珠儿一颗颗掉下来。哎呀，我可真的气坏了。我正打算冲那孩子过去，就在这当儿——那是一扇朝里开的门——就在这当儿，刮来了一阵大风，砰的一声把门关上了，门背后正好砸着我那个孩子！咔啦——扑通一声！——哎呀，我的天哪，那孩子再也动弹不得了！我的魂灵儿一下子给吓跑了，我心里觉得那么——那么——我真不知道心里感觉到底如何。我悄悄地走了出来，浑身上下瑟瑟发抖。随后，我就走过去，轻轻地、慢慢地打开那扇门。我悄没声儿地探出脑袋看了一眼孩子。我突然使劲地大吼一声。可她再也动弹不得了！唉，哈克，当时我就号啕大哭了，我一边把她搂在怀里，一边说：‘哎哟哟，可怜的小东西呀！老天爷饶恕饶恕那个可怜的老吉姆吧！就是因为他这一辈子也都饶恕不了他自己呀！’哦，哈克，孩子她是什么都听不见，什么也说不出，完全聋哑了——可我过去总是那样亏待了她！”





* * *



[1]在这一大段里，哈克列举了许多国王的名字，还谈到了亨利八世的所作所为。这些故事都是事实跟虚构掺杂在一起。亨利八世（1491—1547）：英国都铎王朝的第二代国王（1509—1547在位）。据史载，他确实处死过两名王后，也曾跟两位王后离婚。但是，本书提到其他的人和事则与亨利八世毫不相干，纯系哈克自己编造的。哈克提到的撒克逊七王国，是指5至9世纪不列颠的盎格鲁和撒克逊人的七王国，包括诺森布里亚、墨西亚、东盎格里亚、东撒克斯、南撒克斯、西撒克斯及肯特诸王国，其中有一个国王担任这七王国联盟的盟主。哈克在这里提到的内尔·格温（1650—1687，英国女演员）是查理二世（1630—1685，英国和爱尔兰国王）的情妇；简·肖尔（? —1527）是英格兰国王爱德华四世（1442—1483）的情妇；罗莎曼·克里福德是英王亨利二世（1133—1189）的情妇，有“美人”的称号。哈克提到的《末日审判书》是征服者威廉一世于1086年颁布的《土地调查清册》。《一千零一夜》亦名《天方夜谭》是古代阿拉伯故事集。哈克在这里竟把《末日审判书》跟《一千零一夜》混为一谈了。哈克提到的威灵顿公爵（1769—1852）是18世纪的人，不可能是亨利八世的父亲。在大酒桶里淹死的也不是威灵顿公爵，而据传是克拉伦斯公爵（1449—1478）。哈克提到的波士顿茶党案，是发生在1773年，当时北美各州反对英国统治，拒绝缴纳茶税，并将停泊波士顿海湾内三艘英国船上所载茶叶数百吨，投入海中。三年后，亦即1776年，签署了《独立宣言》，美国人宣布独立。上述事件，与亨利八世毫无关系。





第二十四章


转天傍晚时分，我们在大河当中一块长满柳树的小沙洲岸边拴靠了。那一带河的两岸都有小镇，所以，公爵和国王又在开始策划，想让小镇上的人受骗上当。吉姆跟公爵说，他希望他们去镇上最多一两个钟头，因为他整天价五花大绑，躺在窝棚里，着实是太累、太难受了。你知道，我们上岸的时候，把他一人留在木筏上，总得给他捆绑起来，否则有人见他独个儿待在那里，并没捆绑着，那他就怎么也不像是逃跑后又被逮住的黑奴了。所以公爵说，一天到晚捆绑着躺在那里，确实也是有点儿难受，他打算琢磨出个什么点子来，好让他不吃这种苦头。

这位公爵也着实聪明得出奇，不一会儿，他就琢磨出来了。他让吉姆穿上李尔王那套行头——那是一件印花窗帘布长袍，再加上一套白马尾毛做的假头发和大胡子；随后，他拿演戏化妆用的油彩，给吉姆的脸上、手上、耳朵上、脖颈上涂满了厚厚的一层无活力的青蓝色，看上去活像一具淹死了九天九夜的尸体似的。他要不是我从没见过的一个令人发指的凶神恶煞，那才见鬼呢。随后，公爵拿出来一块小木板，写了这么一个招牌：





生病的阿拉伯人——不过只要精神

不错乱，就不会伤害别人





于是，他就把那块小木板钉在一根木条条上，又把木条条竖立在窝棚前头四五英尺处。没承想吉姆倒也挺满意。他说这比五花大绑，躺在那里，度日如年，每回听到一点儿响声，就吓得浑身上下瑟瑟发抖，可要好得多了。公爵关照他不妨尽量舒心些、自在些，万一有人跑来捣乱，他就得一下子从窝棚里蹦出来，歇斯底里大发作一通，还要像野兽似的大吼一两声。他断定他们准得马上滑脚溜了，也就不管他了。这个点子确实很有道理。可是你说，一个普通老百姓，断断乎不会干等着他大吼一声才开溜呢。嘿，他岂但像个死人，看上去他比死人还要可怕得多。

这些泼皮流氓还打算再演一回《皇家尤物》，因为这个把戏着实让他们捞进好多好多钱，不过他们觉得那个还不太保险，说不定这时候有关他们的消息已从大河上游传播到这儿来了。他们一时踅摸不到一个合适的方案，所以后来公爵就说，他还不如先躺下来，绞尽脑汁想一两个钟头，看看自己能否到东岸阿肯色州那个小镇上去耍一点儿把戏。国王说他打算顺便上西岸那个小镇去，什么方案都没有，但凭老天爷把他指引到发财的路上去——我估摸他心目中的老天爷，指的就是魔鬼。最近有一回我们靠岸的时候，都买过一些现成的衣服。现在，国王就把他买的那套衣服穿上了，还关照我把我的那套也给穿上。当然，我都照办了。国王的那套衣服全是黑的，看上去他果真显得更加有气派、有活力。我从来都不知道换上一套衣服，竟能判若两人。在这以前，他就像是一个十恶不赦的老废物，可是现在呢，他把他那崭新的白水獭帽子一摘去，俯身一打躬，露齿一笑，瞧他那副神气可真是雍容风雅，虔敬有礼，你会说他是刚从方舟[1]里头走出来的，说不定还是老利未蒂克[2]本人哩。吉姆已把小划子打扫干净，我也把桨都准备好了。有一艘大轮船正停靠在大河上游远处的一个岬角底下，离小镇约莫有三英里路——它停泊在那儿已有两个钟头了，一直在装载货物。国王说：

“瞧我这一身漂亮装扮，我觉得也许最好说我是从圣路易斯、或是辛辛那提[3]、或是别的什么大城市下来的。哈克贝利，冲着轮船那儿划过去，我们就搭乘那轮船上小镇去吧。”

我没等他第二次吩咐，就划过去赶大轮船了。我在那个小镇上游半英里处靠拢河岸，随后沿着陡岸附近平缓的水流往前赶过去。过了一会儿，我们看见了一个相貌不俗、不谙世故的乡下小伙子。他正坐在一段圆木头上，擦他满脸的大汗，因为这时天气热得邪门。他身边还有两个毡制手提包。

“掉过船头朝岸边划，”国王说。我就立时划过去了。“小伙子，你上哪儿去呀？”

“搭轮船，到新奥尔良去。”

“到我们船上来吧，”国王说，“且慢，我的佣人会帮你拿手提包。阿道弗斯，快跳上岸去，帮帮这位先生的忙。”——我知道国王是指着我说的。

我就照他的点拨做了，于是，我们三个人一块儿又动身了。这个小伙子千言万语，真是感激不尽；他说这么炎热的天气，拖着这么沉甸甸的行李包裹，实在是累死人。他问国王打算上哪儿去，国王就告诉他说，原是从大河上游下来的，今天早上在那个小镇上了岸，此刻正要往上游赶好几英里地，到那边一个农场去探望一个老朋友。这个年轻小伙子说：

“我头一眼看见您的时候，就暗自琢磨：‘这是威尔克斯先生，准没错，他来得差不多正是时候啦。’可是我继而一想：‘不，我认为不见得就是他吧，要不然，他断断乎不会往上游划去！’您不是他吧，是不是？”

“不，不是的；我叫布洛杰特——亚历山大·布洛杰特——我想我应该叫作亚历山大·布洛杰特牧师，因为我是侍奉上帝的卑微仆人。不过，威尔克斯先生因为没能按时赶到，要是就没得到什么东西的话，那么，我还是照样替他感到很难过——但愿他并不是那样就好。”

“嘿，他尽管来迟了，倒也并没有失去那宗财产，因为不管怎样他总能拿到手；不过，他哥哥彼得临终时，他就没能亲眼看到——对这件事，也许他压根儿不放在心上，反正谁都说不清——可是他的哥哥倒是不惜一切代价，只要能在临终之前见上他一面；在这三个星期里，别的什么话他都没说，老念叨着他这个老弟。他们还是小时候住在一块儿，后来就一直没见过——他的三弟威廉也压根儿没见过——老三是得了聋哑的残障——也只不过三十或三十五岁罢了。只有彼得跟乔治来过这儿；乔治就是那个娶了妻室的兄弟，他跟他的妻子去年都过世了。现在只剩下哈维跟威廉两兄弟还活着。不过，刚才我说过，他们可都没来得及赶到这儿来。”

“有人给他们捎信去吗？”

“哦，当然咯，有的。那还是在一两个月以前，彼得刚得病的时候。因为当时彼得说他好像觉得这回他的病不见得能好了。你看，他偌大一把年纪，乔治的那些闺女的岁数又太小，除了那个红头发的玛丽·简以外，都不太会陪他解闷儿。所以嘛，自从乔治两口子过世以后，彼得他就觉得有点儿孤单，似乎不太想再活下去。他想见见哈维，想得几乎快要疯了——他还想见见威廉，也是为了这个缘故——因为他这个人心肠特别软，立遗嘱准让他心里受不了。他死后留下了一封信，是写给哈维的，说他在信里写明他的钱都藏在什么什么地方，此外还写着他要把他剩下来的财产如何分给乔治的那些闺女，让她们往后不愁吃穿——因为她们老爹乔治死后什么都没留下来。大伙儿撺掇他写遗嘱，结果他就只写了那么一封信。”

“你估摸哈维为什么没有来呢？眼下他住在什么地方？”

“嘿，他呀住在英国——设菲尔德[4]——在那儿传教——压根儿没来过咱们这儿。他一直没有空——除此以外，你知道，说不定他压根儿还没接到过信哩。”

“真惨，真惨，这苦命的人，他在临终前都没能跟他的亲弟弟们见上一面。你说，你打算到新奥尔良去吗？”

“是的，但是，那只不过是我此次远行中的一小段路罢了。下星期三，我打算坐轮船到里约热内卢[5]去，我的老舅住在那儿。”

“去那儿，真够远的。不过，一路上怕也挺有劲儿的；我真恨不得也能去那儿。玛丽·简是最大的一个吗？那另外几个，岁数都有多大了？”

“玛丽·简今年十九岁，苏珊十五，乔安娜大约是十四——就是一心行善积德的那个，她还是个豁嘴子[6]。”

“这些可怜巴巴的丫头！就这样孤苦伶仃，被扔在这个冷酷的人世间呀。”

“得了，她们的日子还算不得太差劲。老彼得生前有的是朋友，他们可不会让她们吃苦头。有霍布森，他是浸礼会的牧师；有基督教新教的执事洛特·霍维；还有本·拉克，阿布纳·沙克福特，以及莱维·贝尔律师；有罗宾逊大夫，跟他们这些人的太太，还有巴特利寡妇，还有——得了，还有好多好多；不过，这些都是彼得最要好的朋友，他写家信时经常要提到他们；所以，哈维一到这儿来，就会知道该上哪儿去找朋友。”

这个老头儿就这么着不断提问，简直把这小伙子心里知道的事儿都给掏光了。我说，他要是不把那个该死的镇上每一个人、每一件事都打听到了，再有，把威尔克斯家里一切的一切，都问得清清楚楚，那才怪呢。他还一一询问他们都是干哪一行的——于是，他才得知：彼得是开鞣皮厂的；乔治是开木匠铺的；哈维是一个不信奉英国国教的牧师，如此等等，不一而足。随后，他说：

“你干吗要往上走那么远，去赶那条大轮船呢？”

“因为那是开往新奥尔良的一条大轮船，我恐怕它在那儿也许不会停的。这些大轮船吃水太深，尽管你大声招呼，也是不肯停的。辛辛那提的船倒是会停的，可是这一条是圣路易斯的船。”

“彼得·威尔克斯很富吗？”

“哦，当然咯，富的很。他既有房产，又有地产。据说他还留下了现款三四千块，就是不知道藏在哪个地方。”

“你说过他是什么时候死的？”

“我可并没有说过呀，不过，他是在昨儿晚上死的。”

“也许是明天出殡吧？”

“不错，大约是在明天中午。”

“唉，真让人太惋惜了。不过话又说回来，不拘是谁，迟早有一天都会死的。所以嘛，我们当务之急，就是事前有所准备，到那时也就不用犯愁啦。”

“是啊，先生，那才是上策呢。我妈也是常常那么说的。”

我们赶到轮船跟前的时候，船上的货物差不多快要装完了，没有多久就开走了。国王压根儿不说上船的话，所以到头来我连大轮船也没得坐上一趟。等那条轮船的影儿再也见不到了，国王就关照我再往上划一英里，来到一个僻静的地方，他自个儿上了岸，还对我说：

“现在赶紧划回去，把公爵接到这儿来，那些新毡制手提包也一块儿捎来。如果说他已经去东岸了，赶快就去那儿把他找回来。转告他不管怎么样，也得把自个儿打扮好。得了，快划走吧。”

我心里明白他要搞什么鬼玩意儿了；可是，我当然一句话也没说。等我带着公爵一块儿回来的时候，我们就把小划子藏起来。随后，他们两个坐在一根圆木头上，国王就把那个小伙子说的话原原本本地告诉了他——连一个字儿都不错。而且，他一边说着这些事，一边还拼命学英国人腔调说话。就他这个笨蛋来说，学得还真不赖。他说话的样子我可学不了，所以也不打算白费劲了。可是话又说回来，他说得还真的有味儿。随后，他说：

“比奇沃特，你装扮个哑巴聋子，怎么样？”

公爵说这件事交给他就得了，准行。他说他在戏台子上聋子、哑巴通通装扮过。于是，他们就坐在那边只管等轮船了。

约莫下午三四点钟光景，开过来两只小轮船，可是都不是从大河上游远处开来的。等到最后开来了一条大轮船，他们就冲着它大声招呼。于是，大轮船上放下来一只小划艇，把我们接到船上去。原来它是从辛辛那提下来的。他们一听说我们打算只走四五英里要下船的，就勃然大怒，痛骂了我们一顿，还说要一路开过去，偏偏不让我们中途上岸。可是国王却照样处之泰然。他说：

“如果说搭船的先生们肯掏腰包，走一英里给一块金币，只消用小艇接上船、送下船，那么，想来船东也一定乐于搭载他们，可不是吗？”

于是，他们就软了下来，说是没有问题。等我们来到那个小镇，他们果然用小艇送我们上岸。岸上有二十多人一见到小艇靠岸，马上就簇拥过来。国王就问：

“你们哪一位先生能告诉我，彼得·威尔克斯先生住在哪儿呀？”他们就面面相觑，频频点头，好像是说：“刚才我跟你说些什么来着？”稍后就有一个人带着一点儿温文尔雅的口吻，说：

“我实在抱歉得很，先生。现在我们只能告诉您：昨儿晚上他还在哪儿住过。”

眨眼间，这个十恶不赦的老东西深知自己彻底完蛋了，他就干脆扑倒在那个人身上，让下巴颏儿搁在他的肩膀上，冲着他的后背号啕大哭，说：

“哎哟哟，哎哟哟！我们可怜巴巴的老大哥呀——他已经走啦，我们这辈子再也见不着他了呀！啊，真是叫人太——太伤心了呀！”

随后，他哭天抹泪地掉过头来，对着公爵打手势，乱比划了一通，也真该死的，他把毡制手提包一扔，放声大哭起来了。他们这两个骗子，要不是我从没见过的最死不要脸的下流胚，那才怪呢。

那时候，人们把他们团团围住了，无不同情他们，跟他们说了许多好话，替他们拿着毡制手提包上山坡，还让他们俩偎靠在他们身上恸哭不止。人们把他哥哥临终时的情景全都告诉了国王，国王他打手势再转告公爵，于是，他们俩就为那个一命呜呼的鞣皮厂掌柜哭天喊地，好像十二门徒[7]通通死了似的。嘿，我要是见过这等事的话，那我就算不上是个人了。这两个家伙无耻下流至极，真是让普天下的人都为有这样的同类感到丢脸。

第二十五章


不到两分钟，消息就传遍了全镇。只见人们从四面八方急匆匆赶来，他们里头有好些人一边飞奔，一边还在穿衣服。过了一会儿，我们就让一大群人团团围住了，这时候脚步声震耳欲聋，真像大队人马出征似的。窗子里和大门前院里，全都爆满了。不时有人隔着围栅探出头来，问：

“就是他们两个吧？”

有个随大溜一块儿往前跑的人，就应声回答说：

“那当然咯，准没错！”

我们来到了那幢住宅的时候，前面的街上早已挤满了人，那三位姑娘都站立在门口。玛丽·简果然是一头红发，但是无伤大雅，她长得着实美极了，她脸蛋儿和眼睛里都是光彩照人，亮丽极了，她一见大伯小叔回来了，真是喜出望外。国王张开了两条胳膊，玛丽·简一下子扑到了他怀里，那个豁嘴子也直冲公爵奔过来，于是，他们就紧紧搂抱在一块儿了！所有在场的人，至少那些娘儿们，看见他们最后骨肉团圆，皆大欢喜，都高兴得差点儿没哭出来。

随后，国王悄悄地用胳膊肘搡了一下公爵——这我清清楚楚地看在眼里——他就向四下里扫了一眼，瞧见在那边墙角里有两把椅子，椅子上头停放着一口棺材。于是，他和公爵都用一只手搭在对方肩膀上，另一只手捂住自己眼睛，慢慢悠悠地、煞有介事地朝那边走过去。大家都往后退去，给他们闪开让路，所有乱哄哄、闹嚷嚷的声音都戛然而止了。有的人还“嘘”了几声，所有的人都把帽子摘下来，低下头，立时鸦雀无声。连一根针儿掉在地上也听得见。他们一走到那里，就俯着身子，往棺材里了一眼，马上哇的一声恸哭起来，那种恸哭声你就算是远在新奥尔良差不多也都听得见。稍后，他们用胳膊搂住对方脖子，用下巴颏儿贴着对方肩膀。约莫有三四分钟，他们俩哭得简直涕泪滂沱，我可从来没见过两条须眉大汉那么个哭鼻子的。你要知道，所有在场的人也全跟着一块儿哭，结果是涕泪纷飞，使地面上都有点儿湿漉漉了，这种事可真是我从来没见过的。后来，他们里头有一个踅到棺材的这一边，另一个踅到棺材的那一边，他们俩一块儿跪下，额头磕在棺材上，假装独个儿在做祷告。你也从没见过，这一群人见此情状后，简直茫然不知所措，不拘是谁，个个情不自禁，放声大哭——连那几位可怜巴巴的姑娘也是这样。差不多每一个女人都走到那几个姑娘跟前，一言不语地、一本正经地亲吻她们的前额，还把手按在她们头上，抬眼望着天空，泪珠儿一串串掉下来，随后哇的一声哭起来，一边抽泣着，一边擦眼泪，依依不舍地离开了她们，好让下一个女人也过来作“秀”。像这样令人恶心的事，我可真还没见过。

过了一会儿，国王站了起来，稍微上前一些，打起精神，前言不搭后语地拉扯了一段话。他一边眼泪汪汪，一边信口开河，说他老大哥命赴黄泉了，他们从四千英里以外长途跋涉赶回来，最后还是没能跟先兄临终前见上一面，对他本人和他可怜的弟弟来说，可真是无比伤悲，痛不欲生；他接着又说他们俩尽管伤心透顶，可是，由于大家给予他们温馨的同情，再加上这么许多圣洁的泪水，却给他们的伤心事平添了一种甜蜜的、乃至于神圣的韵味；所以，他和他弟弟都从他们的心坎里感谢大家，因为光是从嘴巴里说出来的话太没劲、太冷峻，还有好多好多类似的蠢话、废话，也只能叫人听了直恶心，压根儿都表达不了他们由衷的谢意。随后，他就假装虔诚地、抽抽噎噎地喊了一声“阿门”，又扯着嗓子，呼天抢地大哭一场。

他话音刚落，那人群里头立刻有人唱起荣光赞歌来，于是，大家都用足力气高声歌唱；这歌声让你心里感到无比温暖、无比舒畅，仿佛是做完礼拜、离开教堂时一模一样。音乐确实是个好东西；我听完了那一大套奉承话和废话以后，没承想音乐竟能这样妮娓动听，让人的精神为之一爽。

随后，国王又开始唠唠叨叨起来；他说，如果他家的几位至亲好友，今儿晚上乐意留下来跟他们一块儿吃饭，帮着料理后事，那么，他跟他的几位亲侄女都会感到非常欣慰；他说，要是他那个躺在那边的可怜的老大哥能够说话，他一定知道应该自己提名，邀请哪些人来，因为这些人都是他生前的知心朋友，他在信里常常提到他们；所以嘛，他打算提出以下这些人的名字，就是说，他们里头，有霍布森牧师先生，洛特·霍维教会执事，本·拉克先生，阿布纳·沙克福特，莱维·贝尔，罗宾逊大夫，连同他们的夫人，此外还有巴特利寡妇。

霍布森牧师和罗宾逊大夫都到小镇的尽头一块“猎食”去了；那就是说，这位大夫正在把一个病人打发到阴曹地府去，而那个牧师就在旁边给病人引路。贝尔律师到大河上游很远的路易斯维尔[1]出差去了。但是其他的人全在眼前，所以他们都走过来和国王握手，向他道谢，还跟他交谈。他们又走过来跟公爵握手，一句话也不说，只是一个劲儿冲他点头憨笑，好像一拨傻瓜似的；公爵打出各种各样的手势来，乱比划了一通，嘴巴里老在“咕咕——咕咕咕”地不断叫唤，赛过一个还不会说话的小娃娃。

于是，国王就哇啦哇啦地胡扯，故意扯到镇上每一个人和每一条狗的名字，打听他们的消息。他还扯到镇上曾经发生过的好多鸡毛蒜皮的小事情，或是扯到乔治一家人，或是扯到有关彼得本人的事儿。他老是假装以上这些事都是彼得写信告诉他的。不过，那显然是撒谎，他刚才所有胡扯，一桩桩，一件件，都是他从搭我们小划子、赶轮船的傻小子那里掏出来的。

后来，玛丽·简把她父亲临终时留下的那封信拿了出来，国王就把它接过去，大声地念着，还朝着它怪伤心地抽泣着。原来那封信上说要把这幢住宅和三千块金币，留给那三个姑娘；把鞣皮厂（眼下该厂生意兴隆）和其他一些房产、地产（约值七千块钱），还有三千块金币，都留给哈维和威廉，并说明那六千块钱现款藏在地窨子里某某地方。于是，这两个骗子说他们打算把那些钱取出来，处置时务必光明正大，做到一碗水端平，而且还关照我拿支蜡烛一块儿去。我们一进入地窨子，就把门关上了；他们终于找到了那一口袋金币，就把它通通倒在地板上，那么多黄灿灿的金币，端的是好看极了。我的天哪，国王的两只眼睛瞪得贼亮！他冲公爵的肩膀猛击一掌，说：

“嘿，真帅啊！这要是不算帅，哪儿还有帅的呢！哎哟哟，我说，这才是真帅！比奇，这总比演《皇家尤物》要合算得多了吧，可不是？”

公爵说那倒也是。他们把金币一把一把地抓在手里，再让它们从手指缝隙里筛落下去，掉在地板上当琅当琅地直响。国王说：

“光是空口说大话，压根儿不管用；你我假冒刚去世的富翁的弟兄，代表死者留在国外的继承人，真称得上里手行家啦，比奇。眼下我们交好运，都是托老天爷的福。归根到底，就数这一招最灵。我样样都试过了，可就是没有比它更灵的了。”

眼看着这一大堆金币，差不多谁都会心满意足，相信钱数准不会有错；可是，不，这两个家伙不是那样，他们硬要数一数。于是，他们就数了一遍，结果发觉短缺了四百一十五块金币。国王说：

“这个真该死的家伙，我可纳闷他拿着四百一十五块钱干什么去了？”

他们犯愁了一会儿，就到处胡乱搜抄了一遍。接着，公爵说：

“哦，他早已一病不起了，也许是他记错了——我估摸准是这么回事。最好还是别管它，压根儿不提它就得了。这一点儿钱，难道我们还肉痛吗。”

“呸，哪有这回事，我们当然不会肉痛。这一点儿钱，我压根儿不在乎——倒是钱数我觉得顶要紧。你知道，我们在这儿要做到正大光明，公开，不作假，一碗水端平。我们要把这些钱扛上去，当着大家的面点清楚，那么，人家再也不会疑心了。不过，死者既然说过总共有六千块钱，你知道，我们可不要——”

“别说啦，”公爵说，“我们干脆把短缺的那一部分钱都给补足吧。”——于是，他就开始从自己口袋里掏摸金币。

“这个点子可真呱呱叫，公爵——你的脑子真可以说是聪明绝顶啦，”国王说，“亏得那出老把戏《皇家尤物》，又给我们帮了个大忙——”说罢，他也开始掏摸金币，把它们码成一堆。

这一下差点儿使他们破了产，可是不多不少，正好把那六千块钱都给凑足了。

“喂，”公爵说，“我又想起一个点子来了。我们到上头点清楚钱数以后，通通送给那三个姑娘就得了。”

“我的天哪，公爵，让我来搂你一下吧！你怎么会灵机一动，想出这么一个好点子来呀。你的脑子真聪明得惊人，我可从没见过。嘿，这可真是第一流的妙计，一点儿没错。现在他们要是想疑神疑鬼的话，就让他们疑神疑鬼去吧——反正这一下就让他们厥倒了。”

我们上楼以后，大家都集聚在桌子四周围，国王就一边数钱，一边摞起来，三百块钱一小摞——齐刷刷的二十小摞。不拘是谁看了它们一眼，全都垂涎欲滴。随后，他们把钱又装进口袋里，我看见国王又开始自命不凡，想再来上一段话儿。他说：

“诸位至亲好友，躺在那边的是我可怜的大哥，他对所有留在尘世、为他伤心落泪的人，都是非常慷慨大方。他对这几个可怜巴巴的女孩子，也是非常厚道，向来爱护备至，因为她们都是没爹没娘的了。不错，我们认得他的，全都知道，他要不是怕伤了威廉跟我的手足之情，谅必对她们会更加慷慨大方。难道说他不会这样吗？这是毫无问题的，我心里就是这么想的。那么，好了——事到如今，要是还让先兄他在九泉之下抱憾终身，那我们还能算什么亲兄弟呢？要是事到如今，我们还要来抢——不错，是来抢——先兄所心疼的既可怜又可爱的女孩子的钱，那么，我们还能算什么伯伯叔叔呢？我要是知道威廉的意思的话——其实，我想我是知道的——他也会——得了，还不如我问他一下吧。”他掉过身去，对着公爵打好多手势，乱比划了一通；公爵开头光是瞪着两只眼睛瞅他，傻乎乎地直发愣，稍后仿佛猛地吃透了他的意思，就冲着国王蹦了过去，一边咕咕咕地叫唤，尽量露出高兴的样子来，一边不断搂着国王几乎有十五次之多，方才打住。于是，国王说：“这我早就知道啦；我想，他的这种举止表现，足以让大伙儿都相信，他对这件事是怎么个看法。过来吧，玛丽·简、苏珊、乔安娜，把钱拿去吧——通通都拿去。这是躺在那边的他老人家送给你们的，他虽然尸骨未寒，可他一定会含笑九泉。”

玛丽·简立时朝着他走过去，苏珊和豁嘴子也都朝着公爵走过去，跟着又是那么一阵搂抱、亲吻，我可真是从来没见过。于是，大家眼里都噙着泪水簇拥过来，跟他们这两个骗子拉手，差点儿把他们的手快要拉断了；大家嘴里还老是在说：

“你们两位好心肠的人呀！——该有多了不起！——万万没想到啊！”

后来，没有多久，大家又都谈起死者来了，说他生前是如何如何厚道，又说他这一死该是多么巨大的损失，以及好多类似这样的话。过了一会儿，有一个烈性大汉，打从外头挤了进来，站在那儿一边听一边看，一句话都不说，别人也不跟他说话，因为这当儿国王正在说话，大伙儿全都忙着听讲呢。国王正在说——恰好说到他刚提到的一件事的半当中：

“——你们各位，都是死者生前特别知己的好朋友。所以嘛，今儿晚上我们特请你们吃饭。不过，我们希望明天大伙儿都来——不管是哪一位；因为先兄他对大家都很器重，也很喜欢，所以他这场出殡的抓宴[2]就要向大家公开，那才算说得过去啦。”

他就这么精神恍惚地胡说八道下去，自己听着居然好像还很得意似的；他动不动老是把他出殡的抓宴重提一遍，让公爵听着听着也都再也按捺不住了，只好在一张小纸条上，写了“‘葬礼’，你这老笨蛋”，随后把小纸条折好，一边咕咕咕地叫唤，一边走过去，打从大伙儿头顶上递给国王。国王打开来，看了一下，就把它掖进口袋里去了，说：

“可怜的威廉，他虽然身有残障，受尽折磨，可是他始终心明眼亮。他要让我邀请大家都来送葬——他关照我要欢迎大家全都到场。其实，他压根儿用不着犯愁——现在我不是正在邀请大家了吗？”

随后，他又面不改色心不跳地胡编乱诌了一通，时不时把他“出殡的抓宴”照旧搀进去，跟刚才他说话时一模一样。他说完了第三遍以后，就这个词儿特别加以解释，说：

“我之所以说‘抓宴”并不是因为它是一个普通的名词，其实，它压根儿不是——‘葬礼’这两个字儿才是普通名词哩——不过话又说回来，‘抓宴’是个正经八百的名词。现在‘葬礼’两个字儿，在英国再也不通用了——反正它已经过时作废了。目前我们在英国老是说‘抓宴’。‘抓宴’这两个字儿就要好得多了，因为它恰好表达了你要说的意思，所以说也要精当得多。这个词儿是由希腊文词头跟希伯来文词尾拼凑而成：词头含有‘在外面’、‘公开’、‘在国外’的意思，词尾则有‘在里面’的意思，比方说，把种子撒在地里，用泥土盖上，从而又引申出‘掩埋’的意思。所以说‘出殡的抓宴’就是在外面当着大家的面公开的掩埋，那么一解释，你也就自然明白啦。”

他这个死不要脸的下流坯，我真是从来还没见过。就在这时候，那个烈性大汉，却面对着他哈哈大笑起来。让所有在场的人全都大惊失色。大家都说：“哎呀，大夫你怎么啦？”阿布纳·沙克福特说：

“怎么啦，罗宾逊，难道你还没听说过这个消息吗？这个人就是哈维·威尔克斯啊。”

国王赶紧赔着笑脸，把手伸了过去，说：

“原来您就是我可怜巴巴的先兄的知己朋友、大名鼎鼎的医生吗？我——”

“把手缩回去，别碰着我！”这位大夫说，“你说话腔调像英国人——真的像还是不像？像你模仿得这样糟糕的英国话，我可还真没听见过哪。你也算是彼得·威尔克斯的兄弟吗？你压根儿就是骗子，好一个大骗子！”

瞧，大伙儿听了该有多么激愤啊！他们簇拥过来，把这位大夫围住，劝他息怒，竭力给他解释，并且还告诉他，说哈维从许多方面都能展示出他本人确实是哈维，说他对大家姓啥名谁都叫得出来，连一条条狗的名字也知道；他们一次又一次地乞求他，千万别伤了哈维的心，也别让那几个可怜的孤女伤心，此外还有许许多多类似这样的话。可是这一切还都是不管用，这位医生依然怒不可遏，说凡是假英国人而英国话却又说得糟透了，那准是个骗子，显然是在扯谎。这时候，那几个可怜巴巴的女孩子全都搂着国王，抽抽噎噎地哭个不休。冷不防大夫掉过脸去，冲着她们说：

“想当年，我是你们先父的朋友，现在我就是你们的朋友。我现在作为一个忠实的朋友，向你们进一言，为了保护你们，不让你们受苦受难，我规劝你们压根儿别理睬这个流氓，别跟这个不识字的走江湖的家伙交往；亏他还满嘴乱说他那种憨希腊文、憨希伯来文。像他这样的骗子本来一眼就能揭穿了的——真不知道他从哪儿打听得来这些空无其人的名字，以及许多子虚乌有的事儿，就踅到我们这儿来行骗；你们居然也就把他胡说的瞎话都当作证据了；还有眼前这些糊涂朋友，他们心里本该比你们更明白，不知怎的也帮着这个大骗子，让你们受骗上当。玛丽·简，你知道我是你的朋友，你也知道我是你的一个没有私心的朋友。你现在应该听我的话，把这个十恶不赦的流氓马上撵出去——我求求你务必这么做。你觉得好吗？”

玛丽·简就身子一挺直，天哪，瞧她可真漂亮极了！她说：

“这就是我的回答。”她把那口袋金币端起来，放在国王手里，说：“这六千块钱你都拿去，替我们姐妹投资去，怎么个投法随你便，也用不着给我们打收条。”

随后，她就站到国王一边，用一条胳膊搂住他；苏珊和豁嘴子则站到另一边，也一样搂住他。大伙儿都一边热烈鼓掌，一边直跺脚，把地板跺得震天响，如同暴风雨一般。这时候，国王昂起头来站在那儿，笑逐颜开，得意极了。那位医生就说：

“算了，这件事我可就不管啦。不过，我可得警告你们大家：往后你们只要一想到今天这种事，心里总会觉得怪难过的。”说罢，他就扬长而去了。

“得了，大夫，”国王略带讥嘲的口吻，说，“那我们总还得让她们找人去请你啊。”——话音刚落，大伙儿哈哈大笑起来，都说这一句俏皮话顶呱呱，真过瘾。

第二十六章


大伙儿都散了以后，国王就问玛丽·简有没有闲置的房间。她说自己有一个空房间，可以给威廉叔叔住，她还会把自己那个稍微大些的房间让给哈维伯伯，她自己就到妹妹房间里去，睡在一张小床上。屋顶阁楼上还有小小一个斗室，里间有一只小榻。国王说这个斗室不妨给他的男仆住——他在这里指的就是我。

于是，玛丽·简就领我们上楼，把她们的房间一一指给我们看，房间里面陈设简朴，但很精致。她说她房间里的衣裙和杂物哈维伯伯要是觉得碍手碍脚的话，她都可以把它们搬出去，可是伯伯却说一点儿不碍事。那些衣裙都是贴墙挂在那里，前面有一块长长的印花棉布挂帘，一直垂到地板上。一个角落里放着一只破旧不堪的皮箱，另一个角落里竖立着一只存放吉他的长盒子，此外还有各式各样的小玩具和小摆设，都是女孩子们给闺房增添一点儿情调时用的装饰品。国王说有了那些装饰品，越来越像是宾至如归，让人看着赏心悦目，所以也用不着再挪动了。公爵的那个房间相当小，可也是够好的，我的那个斗室也蛮不错。

当天晚上，他们大摆酒宴，所有宾客，男男女女，全都坐在一起。我站在国王和公爵的坐椅背后侍候着，还有好几个黑人侍候着其他的客人。玛丽·简坐在东道主的座位上，苏珊坐在她的旁边，她们俩嘀嘀咕咕地都说：软烤小圆饼怎么没有味儿，果酱怎么个酸不溜丢的，炸嫩子鸡怎么肉头老得嚼不动——还有好多类似这样的废话。女人家老爱这么个数落着，逗得宾客们也不得不来上几句恭维话。其实，她们这些娘儿们全都知道，烧、烤、炸、炒，样样精通，因此也就随大溜这么说：“你们怎么把小圆饼烤得这么焦黄呀？”“我的天哪，这么爽口的酸黄瓜，你们是从哪儿觅来的呀？”还有好多类似这样假惺惺的奉承话，都是人们在酒席上惯常要说的，你知道。

晚宴完了以后，我和豁嘴子在厨房里吃点儿残羹剩菜，权且果腹，其他的人都帮着那几个黑人一块儿拾掇去了。豁嘴子一个劲儿向我提问许许多多有关英国的事，有时候让我简直回答不了，真的担心差点儿没露馅儿。她说：

“你看见过国王吗？”

“哪一个国王？是威廉四世[1]吗，当然咯，看见过——他常去我们的教堂做礼拜。”我知道他早就死了好多年，可是我故意一字不提它。所以，我一说他常去我们的教堂，她就问：

“你说什么——他常去吗？”

“不错——他常去。他的座位，恰在我们的座位对面——就在讲坛的那一边。”

“我还估摸他住在伦敦，是吗？”

“那当然咯。他不住在伦敦，住在哪儿呢？”

“可是我说，你们不是住在设菲尔德吗？”

我知道她这一问可把我难住了。我不得不假装被鸡骨头哽住了，以便赢得多一点儿时间来想一想，怎样才能给自己解围。稍后，我就说：

“我的意思是说，他住在设菲尔德时，经常到我们的教堂里去。那只有在盛夏时节，他常去那儿洗海水浴。”

“嘿，你这是胡扯——设菲尔德压根儿不在海边。”

“嘿，谁说它不在海边呀？”

“得了，反正是你说的。”

“我可没说过，压根儿没说过。”

“你可说过了！”

“我可没有。”

“你是说过了。”

“我压根儿就没说过那种话。”

“好吧，那你到底说过些什么呀？”

“我说过他是上那儿洗海水浴——我说过的就是这些。”

“那就得了！要是你们那个地方不在海边，他怎能洗海水浴？”

“你且听着，”我说，“你见过国会泉水[2]没有？”

“当然咯，见过。”

“那么，你是不是非去国会，才能弄到那种泉水呢？”

“当然咯，不是。”

“那就得了，威廉四世也不是非去海边，才能洗海水浴呀。”

“那么，他究竟是怎么弄来的？”

“就像这儿的人弄来‘国会泉水’一样——一桶一桶地运过来。设菲尔德的皇宫里，有好几座大锅炉，他只要把水烧热了就行。可是在老远的海边，哪能供应得上那么多热水。他们压根儿没有那种装置设备。”

“哦，现在我才闹明白。你干吗不早点儿说呀？节省一点儿时间。”

我一听到她说的这些话，就知道自个儿已经蒙混过关，所以我心里觉得非常适意、非常高兴。接下来，她又问：

“你也上教堂去吗？”

“是啊——经常去。”

“你经常坐在哪儿呀？”

“哦，坐在我们的座位上啊？”

“是谁的座位？”

“哦，当然是我们的——你那个哈维伯伯的。”

“是他的座位？他要一个座位干什么？”

“要坐在它上面呀。那你觉得他要一个座位干什么呢？”

“哦，我还以为他是在讲坛上哪。”

真该死，我忘了他是个牧师了。我知道她又把我难住了，我出于无奈，只好又一次被鸡骨头哽住了，趁此机会想了一想。过后我就说：

“真怪，你认为教堂里就只有一个牧师吗？”

“那么，多了几个牧师又有什么用？”

“怎么啦——给国王讲道，光有一个牧师就够了吗？我可真的从没见过像你这样的傻闺女。他们那里少说也有十七个。”

“十七个！我的天哪！哦，我才不坐在那儿，听那一大套牧师讲道，就是永世不得进天堂，我也甘心。想必他们要讲上一个礼拜呀？”

“哪有这回事呀，他们可不是在同一天个个都上讲坛呀——只有一个上讲坛传道的。”

“那么，其他那些人都干啥去了？”

“哦，也没得多少事呗。到处逛来逛去，递递奉献盘[3]——干点儿这个，或是干点儿那个。不过，他们八成儿是没有事干。”

“那么，要他们来有什么用呢？”

“嘿，他们是专门摆谱儿呗。难道说你什么都不懂吗？”

“哎呀，我压根儿不想懂得这种傻事儿。我说，英国人对待佣人怎么样？他们对待佣人，比我们对待黑奴，是不是要好得多？”

“不，绝对不是的。佣人在英国压根儿就不起眼。他们看待佣人连狗仔还不如呢。”

“他们给不给佣人放假呀？是不是跟我们一样过圣诞节，也过一个礼拜的新年，还有七月四日[4]这个节日。”

“嘿，你先听着！你那么一说，谁都知道你从来没到过英国。我就老实告诉你吧，豁——乔安娜，他们一年到头一天假也不放；他们一辈子都不去看马戏，也不去看话剧，更不去看黑人表演，到哪儿都不去的。”

“教堂里也不去？”

“教堂里也不去。”

“可是你不是常常到教堂里去吗？”

真该死，我又被她给难住了。我忘了自己还是那个老头儿的仆从了。不过，我马上来个急转弯，竭力给自己辩白，说仆从跟普通佣人如何如何不一样，非得去教堂不可，不管他乐意不乐意去，而且还得跟着东家一家人坐在一起，因为法律上就有明文规定。无奈我依然没能给自己圆谎，说完了以后，我看见她还是不满意。她说：

“说老实话，你是不是一直在跟我扯谎？”

“我说的都是实话嘛。”我说。

“都是实话？”

“都是实话。一句谎话也都没有。”我说。

“把你的手按在这本书上，发誓吧。”

我一看那只不过是一本字典，就把手按在上头发了誓。这么一来，她好像有点儿满意了。她说：

“那么，好吧，你的话有些我信，可是，还有些，天哪，我怎么也不信呀。”

这时，玛丽·简凑巧走了进来，后面还跟着苏珊。“你究竟还有哪些不信的呀，乔安娜？”玛丽·简说，“你跟他说话既没分寸，又不客气，要知道他这是远离亲人，来我们这儿做客的。人家要是也这么对待你，你会乐意吗？”

“玛丽，你这是老脾气啦——老爱自告奋勇，先来帮着别人，莫让他受委屈。其实，我丝毫也没伤害过他。我觉得他跟我说了一些谎话，我就说我可不能全信。我跟他说的，总共就是这么两句话。我估摸那么区区小事，他总还顶得住吧？”

“我才不管它是小事还是大事，反正他到我们家里来，好歹还是一个稀客，你跟他这样说话，总是不合适的。你要是处在他的地位，你也会感到怪难为情。所以，你不应该跟人家说这样的话，让人家也感到怪难为情。”

“唉。玛丽，你不知道，刚才他说——”

“不管他说过什么，都没关系——要害不在这里。顶要紧的是你要对他客客气气，不要说出那种话来，让人觉得毕竟自己远离家乡，亲人不在身边啊。”

我暗自思忖，这确实是一个好姑娘，可是我却让那个老贼把她的钱抢走！

随后，苏珊她也插进来，把豁嘴子训了一通，信不信由你。

我暗自寻思，这又是一位好姑娘，可是我却让那个老贼把她的钱抢走！

稍后，玛丽·简跟豁嘴子又来了一个回合，不过这一回却是温情脉脉地劝慰她一番——她的脾气历来都是那样——殊不知玛丽话音刚落，可怜巴巴的豁嘴子，几乎连一句话儿都说不出来了。所以，她就只好发起牢骚来了。

“那么，算了吧，”她的两个姐姐都说“，你索性给他赔个不是吧。”

她果然也依着赔了不是，而且赔得漂亮极了——她的话儿说得真是怪动听的。我恨不得给她再扯上一千句谎话，让她给我多赔几个不是。

我暗自琢磨，这又是一位好姑娘，可是我却让那个老贼把她的钱抢走！她赔完了不是以后，她们三姐妹就竭力让我像在家里一样无拘无束，觉得自己是跟好朋友在一起。那时，我真的感到自己太窝囊、太卑鄙、太下贱，所以我就暗自寻思：我已下定决心，不管怎么样，我一定也要替她们把钱藏匿起来。

于是，我就溜了出去——说是要去睡觉，其实，我心里想现在还不是时候呢。我到了外面，独自一人，就仔细地思考着这件事。我暗自琢磨，我该不该悄悄地去找那个医生，把这两个骗子都告发了？不——那可万万使不得。也许他会说是谁告诉他的；那时候，国王和公爵就会给我颜色看。我可不可以悄悄地告诉玛丽·简？不——我可不敢那么做。她脸上的表情肯定让他们一眼就看出来了；他们既然钱已到手，一定会马上出逃，而且把钱一块儿带走。要是她叫人去抓捕他们，我估摸迟早一定会把我也掺和进去。不，现在只有一个好办法，别的都不管用。那就是说，我不管怎样，必须把钱偷过来，而且还要做到神不知鬼不觉，让他们不会怀疑是我偷的。他们在这儿既然已经旗开得胜，他们要不是拼了老命，把这一家人、这一个镇都耍得腻味了，也绝不会马上开溜的，所以，我认为自己有的是机会和时间。我要把钱偷过来，藏起来；过不了多久，等我顺水而下，远离小镇时，就给玛丽·简写信，告诉她那钱藏在哪个地方。可是，我继而一想，我要是可能的话，最好今天夜里就把钱藏起来，因为也许那位医生断断乎不会就此罢休的，尽管他假装自己不管这件事了；说不定他还会把他们两个吓跑了。

所以，我估摸，我还是不妨先去搜抄一下他们的房间。楼上过道里头黑咕隆咚的，可我还是踅摸到了公爵的那个房间，就开始在里头乱摸了一通。可是，我忽然又想到，那么多钱国王不太可能交给别人保管，肯定是他亲自掌管；所以，我又来到他的房间，到处乱摸了一通。我知道不点蜡烛什么事都办不了，可我当然也不敢点起蜡烛来。我揣想，我还得采取另一个对策了——先是在这儿打埋伏，偷听壁脚。约莫就在这时候，我猛地听见他们上楼的脚步声，立时想要钻进床底下去，我走过去一摸，自己没料到，原来那床并不是在那儿；可是不管怎样，我踅摸到了那块帘子——玛丽·简用来挡衣裙的那块帘子，于是，我就一纵身蹦到帘子背后去，紧紧地偎依在那些衣裙当中，纹丝不动地站着听。

他们一进来，就把门关上了。公爵做的头一件事，就是俯下身子，往床底下了一眼。我暗自高兴极了，亏得刚才没有摸到床那边去。不过，你知道，你要是想干一件见不得人的事，躲到床底下去，本来也是很自然的。随后，他们就坐下来，国王开腔说：

“喂，你这是怎么搞的？快一点儿，长话短说吧，因为我们与其上楼后让他们有机会背后议论我们，还不如待在楼下，一个劲儿激他们哭死人呢。”

“哦，就是这么回事，卡佩。我有点儿不放心哩；我老觉得怪不对劲。那个医生总在我脑海里萦绕不去。我很想知道你到底有什么神机妙算来着。不过我倒是有个点子，我觉得还蛮不错哩。”

“那你有个什么点子，公爵？”

“我们最好在凌晨三点钟以前就溜出去，带着我们已到手的东西，飞也似的直奔大河下游。特别是那一大堆钱，我们得来简直毫不费工夫——尽管本来我们还打算要把它偷回来呢。可是人家却又交还给我们，你可以说，好像是从天上掉下来的。所以，我主张马上歇手，开溜。”

这一下让我干着急。我要是在一两个钟头以前听到了，恐怕就有点儿不一样，可是现在确实让我既着急又失望，殊不知国王却恶狠狠地说：

“什么！难道说剩下来的产业还没有都卖光，就开溜了？像一小拨傻瓜似的开溜了，却把唾手可得的、价值八九千块钱的资产扔下不管？——而且这些还都是响当当的抢手货？”

公爵咕哝着一会儿，他说：这一口袋金币，早就足够了，他不想让自己介入更深了——他可不愿意把孤女们所有的东西都洗劫一空。

“嘿，你这是什么话呀！”国王说，“除了这一大堆钱以外，我们压根儿就没抢去她们什么。反正买进产业的那些人才算是倒霉，因为人家只要发觉那些产业并不是属于我们的——我们跑了以后不久就会水落石出——这些买卖也就算无效了，所有的产业通通退回给原主。这儿的孤儿们就会把她们的房子再弄回来，那对她们来说也就绰绰有余了；她们都还年纪轻，精力足，挣钱过日子并不难。她们断断乎不会挨饿受冻。嘿，你不妨想一想吧——有成千上万的人的日子过得都还没有她们好哩。我的天哪，她们没有什么好叹苦经的呀。”

国王把公爵说得简直头昏眼黑；到最后他也只好屈从了，说“敢情好”，不过，他还是说他觉得再待在这儿，真该死，是犯傻了，他又说那个医生一直盯住他们不放。不料，国王却说：

“那个真该死的医生！干吗要提防他呀？镇上的那些傻瓜蛋不是都站到我们这一边吗？不管在哪个镇上，那也算得上是大多数啦。”

于是，他们就打算再下楼去。公爵说：

“依我看，我们藏钱的那个地方不太妥当。”

这一句话，让我听了太高兴啦。开头我还觉得一点儿线索也踅摸不着呢。国王说：

“怎么啦？”

“因为玛丽·简从现在起就得服丧守孝，你知道，首先她一定要打发那个整理房间的黑人，把这些衣物找个箱子给拾掇起来；难道说你还以为天底下真有见钱不偷的黑人吗？”

“公爵，你的头脑总算清醒过来了。”国王说；他就在帘子底下、离我两三英尺处，乱摸了一会儿。我紧紧地贴着墙，始终纹丝不动，虽然我已吓得浑身瑟瑟发抖。我暗自纳闷，真不知道，他们这两个家伙要是把我逮住了，会对我说些什么；我继而一想，万一他们真的逮住了我，我应该怎么回应才好。可是我还没来得及想好半拉个念头来，国王早把那口袋钱取走了，丝毫也没怀疑此刻我就在他身边。他们就掀起羽绒垫褥，把那口袋钱塞到干草垫褥上的一条裂缝里，接着又往干草里头塞进去了一两英尺深。他们都说这么一来就万无一失了，因为黑人平日里只管拾掇羽绒垫褥，——干草垫褥是连碰都不会碰一下，一年里头也只不过翻晒两回罢了——所以说，现在断断乎不会有失窃的危险了。

但是只有我才心里有数。他们下楼刚好下了一半，我就把那口袋钱从干草垫褥里头取出来了。我摸索着，来到我顶楼那个斗室。我把它暂且藏在那儿，等有机会再把它收藏好。我觉得最好还是藏到住宅外面某个地方，因为他们一发现钱没有了，肯定要在住宅内进行彻底搜查。这个就数我心里最清楚啦。随后，我连衣服都没脱掉就上了床；不过，我就是想睡也睡不着，因为我已是心急如焚，老想把这件事办好。不久，我忽听见国王和公爵上楼来了，我就一骨碌从小榻上爬下来，让下巴颏儿搁在楼梯口，姑且等着瞧会不会出了什么事儿。可是结果什么都没有。

我就这么着等下去，一直等到深夜万籁俱寂，但是大清早的声音还没响起来；随后，我就溜下楼去了。

第二十七章


我一声不响地走到他们房门口听了一下，他们正在鼾声大作。我就踮起脚尖，悄没声儿下了楼。四下里一点儿声响都没有。我透过饭厅的门缝，往里头瞥了一眼，只见那些守灵人都坐在椅子上头睡着了。通往客厅的那扇门敞开着，尸体停放在客厅里，两个房间里都点着蜡烛。我再往前头走过去，但见客厅的门也开着；不过在这个房间里，除了彼得的遗体以外，一个人也没有。我就擦着棺材溜过去，可是前门已锁上了，钥匙也没留在那里。正在这时候，我从背后听见有人从楼上下来的声音。我立刻往客厅奔去，向四下里匆匆扫了一眼，只看见有一个地方——就是那具棺材里头——倒是可以藏那口袋钱。棺材盖往后挪了约莫一英尺左右，看得见里头死者的脸，脸上还掩着一块湿布，身上穿着殓衣。我就把那口袋钱往棺材盖底下塞了进去，正好放在死者交叉着的双手下面，因为死者的双手冰冰冷，一下子吓得我浑身起鸡皮疙瘩。随后，我就从客厅跑回来，躲在门背后。

走进来的人，原来就是玛丽·简。她轻声轻气地走到棺材跟前，跪下来，往里头看了一下。稍后，她用手绢儿捂住脸，只见她早已潸然泪下。虽然我听不见她的声音。我就悄悄地从她的背后，溜了出去。我走过饭厅的时候，想要闹明白那些守灵人究竟看见了我没有，所以，我就从门缝里头瞥了一眼，但见一切都好。他们还是没有惊醒过来。

我悄没声儿爬到床上，心里觉得灰溜溜，因为我费了那么多心机，冒了那么大的危险，现在也只好如此了结。我估摸，那口袋钱倘能留在那里，倒也不错，因为我们到了大河下游一二百英里处，我不妨写信告诉玛丽·简，那她可以把它挖出来，也就物归原主了。不过这种事不见得都能尽如人意。倒是很可能在他们旋紧棺材盖时就会发现这口袋钱，那时国王一定又会把它拿了回去，以后真不知道哪年哪月才让人有机会再偷走了。我当然还想再溜下楼去，把钱从那里取回来，可我就是不敢再去冒这个险。现在，眼看着天快要破晓了，没有多久好几个守夜人就要醒过来了，那时我也许会给他们抓住了——我手里拿着六千块钱，谁都没出钱叫我去掌管它呀！我暗自思忖，我可不乐意跟这等事掺和在一起。

我一早起来，来到楼下，只见客厅已经关上了门，那些守灵人也都走了。除了家里几个人和巴特利寡妇，还有我们这一伙人以外，旁人一个都没有。我仔细端详着他们的脸色，想了解一下莫非出了什么事，可我还是什么也看不出来。

快近中午的时候，殡仪馆老板带着一个帮手一块儿来了。他们把棺材挪到客厅正中央，搁在两把椅子上面，随后把我们的坐椅一排一排地摆好，还向邻居借来了好些，把客厅、饭厅、过道全都摆满了。我看见棺材盖还跟头两天前一样，只见周围都有人，我可不敢走过去往棺材盖底下一。

随后，大家开始簇拥着挤了进来，那两个骗子和三个姑娘，都在棺材顶端头一排椅子上落了座。客人们在半个钟头内鱼贯而入，慢慢悠悠地从棺材跟前绕过去，低着头瞻仰一下死者的遗容，有些人还落了几点眼泪，当时氛围甚是肃静无声。只见那三位姑娘和那两个骗子，拿手绢儿捂住眼睛，一直低着脑袋，偶尔呜咽几声。这时候，只听见大伙儿两脚擦着地板发出的声音，和他们在擤鼻涕的声音——反正人们总爱在棺材跟前擤鼻涕，而且擤得比哪儿都要多，不过在教堂里就只好算例外了。

等到客厅里爆满了的时候，那个殡仪馆老板，就戴上他那副黑手套，轻手轻脚地、让人宽心地到处溜来溜去，正在作最后润色装点，务使人人舒适满意，事事井井有条，而且还像一只猫儿似的，没有一点儿声响。他一句话也不说；所有的客人全都听他调动，他让迟到的客人挤进去，他给他们让开走道来，他做这些事，全靠一边勤点头，一边打手势。稍后，他又走过去，照旧靠墙站在那儿。他是一个手脚轻快、行动诡秘的人，我可从来还没见过：他的脸活像一条火腿，见不到一丝儿笑容。

事前他们借来了一架美式簧风琴——是架破琴。等到一切都就绪了，有一个年轻的女人就落了座，弹起琴来了；那琴声不时发出吱吱嘎嘎的、怪难听的音响，大家居然还都一块儿跟着唱；依我看，此时此地，只有彼得一个人倒是非常优哉游哉。随后，霍布森牧师就慢慢腾腾地、煞有介事地开口讲话了。正在这当儿，忽然从地窨子里传来一阵令人心惊肉跳的喧闹声；原来只是一条狗在那里大声狂吠，简直可闹翻了天，而且还一个劲儿狂吠不停。那位牧师只好伫立在那儿，俯身对着棺材，默不作声地等着——那狂吠声简直震耳欲聋，你连自言自语也都听不见了。那场面着实让人很窘。看来大家全都茫然不知所措。过了一会儿，只见那个长腿子的殡仪馆老板，向牧师打了个手势，好像是说：“你用不着犯愁——这件事全看我就得了。”随后，他就弯着腰，擦着墙根，悄悄地溜了过去，只见他的肩膀忽隐忽现地打从大家头顶上闪过。那喧闹声始终越闹越厉害；后来，他贴着两面墙，绕了过去，突然钻到地窨子里去了。约莫不到两秒钟，我们只听见狠狠地砸了一声，那条狗就像没命似的干号了一两声，于是四下里也就死寂无声了。那位牧师煞有介事地又接上刚才中断了的话讲下去。过了一两分钟，又看见那个殡仪馆老板的后背和肩膀悄悄地贴着墙溜了回来。这一回，他悄悄地绕着客厅的三面墙溜过来，随即昂起头，两手捂住嘴巴，伸长了脖子，越过大家的头顶，冲着牧师嗓门有点儿沙哑地低声耳语说：“原来它逮住了一只耗子！”说罢，他就弯着腰，擦着墙壁溜回到他原来的地方。你一眼就看得出大家都非常满意，因为不拘是谁自然都想知道是怎么回事。其实，像这样的区区小事，压根儿算不了什么的，可是决定一个人是不是招人喜爱，是不是让人看得起，却全靠这类的区区小事。整个小镇上，没有一个人能比这个殡仪馆老板更得人心的了。

葬礼上那一篇讲道，讲得好听极了，可惜太冗长了，不免让人腻烦。于是，国王硬是挤了进来，说了一些他常挂在嘴边的废话，到后来也总算是草草收场了。那个殡仪馆老板就手里拿着螺旋钻，偷偷地开始朝着棺材踅过去。那时，我可急得要命，瞪大两只眼睛直瞅着他。但他一点儿也不乱来一气，只是轻轻地让棺材盖往前移动一点儿，就把螺丝钉紧紧地给拧上了，这一下我可没辙了！我真的不知道那些钱是不是还在棺材里头。于是，我心里就想：如果说有人神出鬼没地把钱都偷走了，那怎么办？——现在，我怎能知道是不是要给玛丽·简写信呢？如果说她把棺材挖出来，发现什么也没有，那她又会对我怎么个看法呢？真该死，我暗自寻思，说不定我会给人抓去坐大牢；我想最好还是闷声不响，瞒着她，压根儿不给她写信吧。这件事现在是乱了套；我本想做得好一些，结果却比原来还要坏上一百倍；我要是不管这件事多好啊！

他们把死者掩埋了以后，我们就都回来了。我又开始仔细端详每个人的脸色——这事我已由不得自己，我老是放心不下。可是一点儿结果都没有，从他们的脸上什么都看不出来。

到了晚上，国王到各处串门，一边博得大家欢心，一边又竭力向大家套近乎。他向大家吹吹风，说他在英国的会众都是心急如焚，盼望他一定要赶快回去，因此他只好把这些遗产处置完了，马上就回家去。他这样急匆匆地赶回去，连自己心里都觉得怪难为情，谅必各位也会觉得挺难过。他们巴不得他能多住一些日子，可是他们说他们也知道那是办不到的事。他还说，他和威廉当然会把这几个姑娘一块儿捎回家去。大家听了全都感到挺高兴，因为往后那几个女孩子就能过上好日子，而且还跟她们的亲人住在一起。女孩子她们听了，也都感到得意扬扬——简直呵得她们身上痒痒的，连世界上曾经让她们发愁的事情也全忘得一干二净了。她们还撺掇他赶快卖掉，她们随时准备好，说走就走。眼看着这些女孩子被他们两个连骗带哄得这么高兴、这么快活，我心里着实难受极了，可是我却又想不出妥善之计来，不敢插嘴，改变大家说话的调子。

国王果然把要拍卖的住宅、黑人，以及所有的产业，马上都列出了清单——而且还定在出殡后的第三天公开拍卖；不过，谁要是存心买的话，私底下先买也可以。

于是，在出殡后的第二天，大约在快近中午的时候，这几个女孩子的满心喜悦，就受到了头一次的打击。原来来了两个黑人贩子，国王就把好几个黑人按公道的价钱卖给了他们，换来了他们所谓三天以后可支取的银行支票，于是他们就走了。那两个儿子卖到密西西比河上游的孟菲斯[1]，他们的老娘却卖到密西西比河下游的新奥尔良去了。我觉得，可怜的女孩子们和那些黑人，一下子悲伤得心都碎了，他们彼此抱头痛哭，到后来简直大吵大闹，使我看了以后心里也难受极了。那些女孩子说，她们连做梦都没想到眼看着这一家子活活地给拆散了，还要被卖到远离本镇的异乡他域去。那些可怜巴巴的女孩子和黑人，他们彼此搂着脖子哭哭啼啼的情景，让我一辈子也忘不掉呀。我要不是早知道这种买卖肯定会泡汤，那几个黑人不到一两个星期就会跑回家里来的话，我一定会按捺不住，奋不顾身地跑去把我们那个强盗帮告发了。

这件事在镇上也闹得满城风雨，有好些人直截了当地说，他们为此活活地拆散了母子亲骨肉，确实是太不像话了。这些话让那两个骗子听了，当然有点儿扫兴。可是，不管公爵怎么说、怎么做，那个老浑蛋还要一意孤行地蛮干下去。老实告诉你吧，公爵倒是为这件事还真的非常揪心。

转天就是拍卖的日子。那天一清早，天刚蒙蒙亮的时候，国王和公爵来到我住的阁楼上，把我给叫醒了。我一看他们的神色，就知道是出了乱子。国王问：

“前天夜里，你去过我的房间没有？”

“没有去呀，陛下。”——在没有旁人在场的时候，我当着我们这一帮子的面，总是这么称呼他。

“昨天白天或是晚上，你去过那儿了没有？”

“没有呀，陛下。”

“现在以名誉担保——不准撒谎。”

“是的，以名誉担保，陛下，我跟您说的，全都是实话。打从玛丽·简小姐领您跟公爵去那儿看过以后，我从来都没有走进您的那个房间过。”

公爵说：

“你看到有别的人进去过没有？”

“也没有呀。大人，据我回想起来，我想是没有人进去过。”

“且慢，你再好好地想一想。”

我仔细琢磨了一会儿，知道机会来了，就说：

“哦，我看到那几个黑人进去过好几回。”

他们两个一下子都蹦了起来，好像是他们始料所不及似的，稍后又好像是早就料到了。于是，公爵说：

“什么，他们全都进去过吗？”

“不——至少不是一块儿进去的。我的意思是说，只有一回看到他们一块儿走出来。”

“哎呀！是哪一天呀？”

“就是出殡的那天呗。那天早晨，已经不算太早了，因为我早就睡过头了。我正打算下楼梯，就看到他们了。”

“哦，往下说，快点儿往下说呀——他们干什么来着？他们举止上有什么表现？”

“他们什么也没干。依我看，他们并没有什么大的动作。他们踮着脚尖走开了；我一眼就看出来，他们原来以为陛下已经起来，就进去给您拾掇房间，或做别的什么活；可是一看，您还没有起来，所以，他们就巴望不要把您吵醒，悄悄地走开了，免得自找麻烦，如果说他们还没有把您吵醒了的话。”

“高级扒手，这事真糟了！”国王说。看来他们两个全都非常肉痛，不免有点儿犯傻了。他们站在那儿，一边想，一边直搔头皮，稍后，公爵突然恍然大悟似的，咯咯地笑了会儿，说：“真帅，那些黑人这一手，耍得着实漂亮！亏他们离开这儿时，还假装着难过得很！甚至于我都信他们真的是难过。所以嘛，连你也信了，大家全都信了。你再也不要跟我说，黑人没有演戏的才能啦。嘿，他们一耍起花招来，不拘是谁都会上当受骗。依我看，从他们身上可以发大财。我要是有本钱、有戏院的话，只要有了这帮子老黑，别的最棒的戏子我全都不稀罕——可是我们偏偏要大出血，便宜得简直等于白送地把他们卖掉了。你瞧，换来的那一丁点儿钱，眼前还到不了手。嘿，那一丁点儿钱在哪儿呢？——那张银行支票呢？”

“上银行支取就得了。你还以为它在哪儿呀？”

“哦，那敢情好，谢天谢地。”

我就有点儿怯声怯气地问：

“是不是出了一点儿差错？”

国王猛地掉过身来，冲我粗声大气地说：

“少管闲事！别再胡思乱想，只管你自个儿的事吧——如果说你自个儿也有事的话。你只要待在这个镇上不走，老得记住这个，听见了没有？”随后，他就跟公爵说：“我们得咽下这口气，什么都不说。我们最好还是别声张。”

他们刚要下梯子的时候，公爵却又咯咯地笑了一会儿，说：

“卖得快，所以赚头少啦！这个买卖真是呱呱叫——准没错。”

国王扭过头去，冲他咆哮着说：

“我所以要把他们赶快卖掉，原是尽量从最好方面着想呀。如果说结果是等于零，到时什么也带不走，还赔上了好多钱，难道说我的过错不就是比你大吗？”

“得了吧，当初要是听了我的话，他们还会在这儿待着，我们早就开溜了。”

国王马上跟公爵顶了几句嘴，实际上要稳住他，随后又掉过头来训我了。他骂了我一通，说我明明看到那几个黑人从他房间里悄悄地走出来，干吗不赶紧跑去告诉他——他还说，哪怕是个傻瓜蛋，也会知道准定是出了事。接着，他又一下子咒骂起他自己，说都得怪他自己不好，因为那天早上他没有睡好，晚了一点儿起来；他还说，往后他要是再那么干的话，他就真的该死啦。于是，他们两个就唠唠叨叨地责骂着走开了。我真是感到高兴极了，因为我把这件事全都推到了那几个黑人身上，而且一丁点也没有伤害他们。

第二十八章


过了一会儿，就到了起床的时候。我就下了梯子，打算去楼下。可是我一走近那几位姑娘的房间，就看见房门敞着，玛丽·简正坐在她那只旧皮箱旁边，箱子已打开，她一直在拾掇衣物，准备到英国去。不过此刻她停下来了，腿上放着一件叠好的女礼服，她两手捂住脸，正在抽噎着哩。我目睹着她那种情状，心里真是难受极了；当然咯，不拘是谁都会感到难受。于是，我就走了进去，跟她说：

“玛丽·简小姐，你是不忍心见到别人有为难的事，我也是一样——差不多老是这样。您有什么心事，就不妨跟我说吧。”

于是，她就跟我说开了。果真是为了那几个黑人——我早就猜着啦。她说，本来她此次英国之行是够美的，可是如今她的兴致差不多一点儿都没有了。她真不知道到了英国以后，心里怎么还会乐得起来，因为她晓得，那个黑人母亲跟她的孩子们，从今以后彼此再也见不到面了——突然间，她号啕大哭起来，哭得更加伤心了，随后，只见她两手往上一挥，说：

“哎呀，天哪，天哪，他们母子之间再也见不到面了！想一想，真让人难过！”

“不过，他们还是会见面的——过不了两个星期——我可知道！”我跟她这样说。

我的天哪，我还来不及想一想就脱口而出！——我还来不及稍微挪动一下，她早已伸过来两条胳膊，搂住了我的脖子，关照我再说一遍，再说一遍，再说一遍！

我知道我说得太突然，说得太过头了，我顿时陷入窘境。我请求她让我再好好想一会儿，她就坐在那儿，非常急躁、亢奋，也挺好看，不过，看来她已经很高兴、很放心了，好像有一个人刚把坏牙拔掉了似的。所以，我就仔细琢磨了一遍。我暗自思忖：一个人置身于窘境时，不得不说出实话来，我认为确实是非常冒险的事情；我尽管没有这种经验，不敢说得太肯定，可是不管怎么样，我总觉得就是这么回事；就眼下这件事来说，我总觉得说实话要比说谎话好得多，实际上也稳当得多。我可一定要把它记在心里，往后再仔细地思考，因为这着实有点儿怪得出格了。像这样的事，我可从来还没有见过哩。不过到最后，我想我还是不妨去碰碰运气：我这一回还是要说实话，虽然这多半就像是坐在一桶火药上，用火点燃后，看看你究竟会被扔到哪儿去。于是，我就说：

“玛丽·简小姐，您可不可以在离镇不太远的什么地方，暂住三四天呢？”

“是啊——我可以去洛思罗普先生家。干什么呀？”

“您先别问干什么。如果说我向您和盘托出，我是怎么知道那几个黑人彼此还会见面——过不了两个星期——就在这幢住宅里——而且证明我又是怎么会知道的——那么，您会乐意到洛思罗普先生家去暂住四天吗？”

“四天！”她说，“我住上一年都行！”

“敢情好，”我说，“单凭您这句话，我就不向您提别的什么要求了。——您的这句话，比别人用嘴亲吻《圣经》起的誓，还要管用得多。”她莞尔一笑，脸上泛着红晕，显得越发可爱。我说：“如果您不介意的话，我想把门关上——再闩上插销。”

随后，我又回来坐下了。我说：

“您可千万别乱吵吵。要正襟危坐着，像一个须眉汉子那样听我细说分明。玛丽小姐，现在我把实话告诉您，您可要鼓起一点儿勇气来，因为这是咄咄怪事，听了会使您难受极了，无奈不把它说出来可又不行。您的这两位伯伯叔叔，压根儿不是您的亲伯伯、亲叔叔——原来他们是两个骗子——地地道道的大骗子。反正我们先把吓人的要害部分说在头上了，剩下来中不溜儿的话，谅您也能顶得住了。”

当然咯，这几句话，早已把她吓得简直好像魂灵出窍似的。可现在我还是处在潜在的危险之中，所以我只好就势一直往前冲下去；她两眼始终炯炯发光，越来越亮；我把那些该死的事情，一桩桩，一件件，全都告诉了她。从我们开头碰见那个去上游、赶轮船的傻小子说起，一直说到她在大门口，情不自禁扑到国王怀里，让他一连亲吻了十六七次时为止——她一听到这儿，顿时蹦了起来，脸儿涨得红彤彤，就像晚霞一般。她说：

“这些衣冠禽兽！走吧——一分钟都耽误不得——连一秒钟也耽误不得——我们赶快给他们浑身涂满柏油，粘上羽毛，通通给扔到河里去！”

我就说：

“当然咯，你这个点子要得，要得。不过，您是打算在您去洛思罗普先生府上前先动手呢，还是——”

“哦，”她说，“我这会儿正在琢磨什么来着！”说罢，她马上又坐下来了。“刚才我说的话，你可别介意——请你千万别介意——你不见得介意，喂，你不见得会吧？”她把她那只柔软的纤手，轻轻地按在我手上，那么一股子脉脉温情，真让我顿时厥倒。我就说我宁死也不会对她介意的。“我从来都没想到，刚才我心乱如麻了，”她说，“现在你再往下说吧，我再也不插话了。你告诉我到底该怎么办；不管你说什么，我就照着去做。”

“哦，”我说，“他们这两个骗子，是一小撮穷凶极恶的家伙，而我目前的处境也很尴尬，不管我愿意不愿意，我好歹还得跟着他们一块儿走南闯北——个中原因，我想还是不告诉您为好——如果说您去告发他们，镇上的人就会把我从他们的魔掌里救出来，那么，我是得救了，可是另一个您不认得的人却要遭殃了。我们还得救救他，是不是？当然咯，那是不用说的。那就得了，我们还是不要告发他们吧。”

我一边说着这些话，一边也想出一个好点子来了。我猛地想到，也许我和吉姆可以把这两个骗子甩掉：先把他们关押在这儿的大牢里，随后我们一块儿跑掉。不过，我可不想在大白天赶木筏，深恐万一人家过来问话，没有旁人帮腔，只好我一个人来应答；所以，我打算等到今天夜深人静时分，开始实行这个方案。我说：

“玛丽·简小姐，我这就告诉您我们该怎么办吧——先说您在洛思罗普先生府上也用不着住那么久了。他府上离这儿有多远呀？”

“差一点儿不到四英里——就在后面附近乡下。”

“哦，那就敢情好。现在，您就上那儿去，躲在那儿，一直到今天晚上九点，或是九点半，过后再叫他们把您送回家里来——就说您忽然想起了什么事儿，急着要回家。要是您在十一点以前回到这儿，就在这个窗子前面点上一支蜡烛；要是我还不露面，您就等到十一点好了；要是到了那个时候我还没来的话，那就说明我已经走了——而且是太太平平地远走了。随后，您不妨走出来，向大家公开宣读我所提供的新情况，就把这两个骗子都给关押起来。”

“好吧，”她说，“我就照着这样办。”

“可是话又说回来，万一碰巧我没有走掉，把我跟他们一块儿都给抓去了，您可要站出来，说我事前已经把这件事的来龙去脉通通告诉您了，而且您还要竭尽全力出来替我撑腰。”

“替你撑腰——那我当然愿意。他们有谁胆敢动一动你头上一根发丝！!”她说。她说这句话的时候，我看见她的鼻子孔都翕张着，她的眼睛也在闪闪发光。

“我要是走了，就不能在这儿给你们作证，说这两个骗子压根儿不是您的伯伯叔叔了，”我说，“其实，就算我还在这儿，我怕也没有多大能耐。我也只好指着上天起誓，说他们确实都是骗子和流氓；当然咯，刚才我这些话，恐怕也有点儿管用。幸好还有许多其他的人，他们要是出来作证，要比我更有力量——他们这些人说的话，断断乎不会像我说的一下子让人产生怀疑。我这就告诉您怎么去找寻他们这些人。给我一支铅笔跟一张纸吧。您看——‘皇家尤物，布里克斯维尔。’把它收起来，千万别丢了。赶明儿法院想要调查有关这两个家伙的劣迹时，让他们派人到布里克斯维尔去，就说那两个演《皇家尤物》的人已被抓住了，请他们出来做见证——那么，眨眼间，整个镇上的人都会直奔这儿来，玛丽·简小姐。而且，他们这些人奔过来时，心头里怒火还没消尽呢。”

我估摸，现在我们差不多一切都已安排停当了。所以，我就说：

“干脆让拍卖照常进行下去，用不着犯愁。因为通告太匆促了，不管是哪一个买主，不等到拍卖结束一整天以后，断断乎不会付钱的。而他们这两个骗子在钱还没到手以前，也断断乎不会离开这里——从我们作出的安排来看，这一回拍卖肯定是泡汤了，他们也断断乎不会捞到钱的。至于那些黑人方面的情况也一样——那压根儿算不上是买卖了，没有多久那几个黑人还会回来的。您知道，他们卖掉黑人的那笔钱，目前还收不上来哩——现在他们已是进退两难，简直没辙了，玛丽·简小姐。”

“好吧，”她说，“现在我下楼吃早饭去，稍后就直接到洛思罗普先生府上去。”

“哎呀，玛丽·简小姐，那么做可不行，”我说，“断断乎也不行呀。早饭前就得走。”

“为什么呢？”

“玛丽·简小姐，您就不妨想一想，我为什么要您非走不可？”

“哦，我压根儿还没想过——可现在想一想，我还是不知道。你说那是为什么？”

“得了吧，那是因为您不是那种脸皮子特厚的人。您脸上的表情，比书上写的还要清清楚楚。不管哪一个人，只要坐下来看上您一眼，就能看透您的心事，好像看一本大字印刷的书一样。您以为每当您的伯伯叔叔亲吻您一下，说一声早上好时，您对他们就满可以应付自如，而从来也不——”

“得了，得了，别往下说啦！好吧，我在早饭前就走——我是很乐意走的。我的两个妹妹就留下来，跟他们在一块儿吗？”

“是的——莫要管她们啦。她们还得留在这儿应付一会儿。要是你们个个都走了，也许他们马上就会起疑心的。我可不让您见到他们，也不让您见到您的妹妹，或是镇上任何一个人——因为只要有邻居来问您的伯伯叔叔今天早上好吗，您脸上一定马上就露馅儿了。不，他们可千万见不得。玛丽·简小姐，请您赶快走吧。他们那些人，我个个都会安排好。我会叫苏珊小姐替您向您的伯伯叔叔问好，就说您外出几个钟头，小歇一会儿，换换空气，或者说您是去看望一位朋友，也许今天晚上，至迟明天一大早就会回来的。”

“说我去看望朋友倒还可以，但是切莫替我向他们问好。”

“那么，请放心吧，我也不见得会那么说的。”跟她说说这样的话，是最能投其所好的了——说实话，原本也是无伤大雅。它只不过是区区一件小事，一点儿也不费劲；可是，在我们大河以南这一带地方，正是这样的区区小事，最能给人排难解忧，也能让玛丽·简小姐心里觉得挺舒服，而且还压根儿不必破费什么。于是，我就说：“还有一件事——就是那一口袋钱。”

“哦，他们早就把它拿走了；一想到那么多钱怎么会让他们拿走的，我就觉得自己真是太傻了。”

“不，您可错了。那些钱他们并没有拿走。”

“那么，到底是谁拿走的？”

“我真的也想知道，可我还是不知道。那些钱我倒是经手过的，因为我曾经从他们两个骗子那里把它偷出来过，我本想把它偷出来，归还给您。现在我只知道自己藏钱的地方，但是我生怕那些钱再也不在那儿啦。玛丽·简小姐，我心里真是难过极了，我觉得非常对不起您；不过，说实话，我已尽到了自己最大努力了。当时，我差点儿给人抓住，所以我头脚跑到那个地方，马上把那口袋钱给塞进去了，于是，我拔脚就跑了——您要知道，那确实不是个好地方呀。”

“哦，别再责怪你自己啦——这样就太要不得了，反正我会谅解的——你也是万不得已啊，那断断乎也怪不得你。你到底把钱藏到哪儿去了？”

我可不愿意让她重新勾起她的伤心事；看来我也没法向她启口，让她知道，棺材里头那具死尸的肚子上，还放着那口袋钱哩。所以，我在片刻之间一句话也没说——到后来，我才说：

“玛丽·简小姐，我不愿意当面告诉您当时我把钱搁在哪儿，要是您宽恕我的话。不过，我会把它写在一张纸条上给您，您要是高兴的话，不妨在去洛思罗普先生府上的路上拿出来看看。您觉得这样做，好吗？”

“哦，好吧。”

于是，我就这样写道：“我把钱放到棺材里头了。那是在昨天深夜里，您正在那儿哭的时候，钱已在里头了。玛丽·简小姐，当时我正躲在门背后，我心里也替您难过得要死呢。”

我只要一想到她在夜深人静时分，孤零零地跪在那儿呜咽着，而那两个恶鬼却高卧在她家宅院里，使她丢脸，还抢她的钱财，就禁不住潸然泪下。等我把纸条折好交给了她，我看见她眼里也有点儿泪汪汪了。她紧紧地拉住我的手，使劲地攥着，说：

“再见吧——我打算事事都照着你的话儿去做。我今后要是没法跟你再见面的话，我一辈子也忘不了你，我会时时刻刻惦念你，我还要默默地替你祷祝！”——说罢，她就抽身走了。

老天哪！要替我祷祝！我估摸，她要是知道我的底细的话，一定会踅摸个跟她身份更相近的人。可是我敢打赌说，她还是照样会替我祷祝——本来她就是这种人嘛。只要她灵机一动，她甚至于会斗胆替犹大[1]祷祝哩——我估摸，她也断断乎不会打退堂鼓。反正不管你怎么说，依我看，她的胆量总要比我所见过的随便哪个女孩子都大些；我觉得她简直浑身是胆。这种话听上去好像是恭维，其实一点儿都没有恭维的味道。倘若说到漂亮——还有心地善良——她也把所有的女孩子全都盖过去了。从我那一次看着她走出房间以后，我再也没见到过她了；不，尽管我再也没见到过她，可我老是惦着她，真不知道有过几千几百万遍，而且我还时时刻刻牢记着她说要替我祷祝的那句话；我只要觉得我替她祷祝也管用的话，那么，我要是不替她祷祝，我就真的该死啦。

我估摸，当时玛丽·简是从后门溜出去的，因为谁都没看到她出走。后来我碰到苏珊和豁嘴子的时候，就说：

“你们有时常过河去串门的那户人家，他们姓什么来着？”

她们说：

“有好几户哩；我们八成儿是去普罗克特家。”

“不错，就是那一家，”我说，“我差点儿把它给忘了。玛丽·简小姐关照我转告你们，她急得要命上那儿去了——因为他们家里有人闹病了。”

“是哪一位呀？”

“我可不知道；至少我有点儿给忘了；不过，我估摸那是个叫作——”

“哎呀，但愿千万不是汉纳吧？”

“论起来真让人怪难受，”我说，“正好碰巧就是汉纳。”

“我的天哪——上星期她还是好端端的！她病得够厉害吗？”

“她病得别提有多厉害啦。玛丽·简小姐说，他们整夜坐在那儿陪她，他们还认为也许她至多只能活几个钟头了。”

“哎呀，这可真是万万想不到呀！那她得的是什么病呀？”

我一时琢磨不出什么合适的病名来，就脱口而出，说：

“流行性腮腺炎。”

“流行性腮腺炎——去你妈妈的！患流行性腮腺炎的病人，从来用不着有人陪夜的。”

“用不着陪夜，是不是？你不信就打个赌好了。这种流行性腮腺炎，就是要有人陪夜。这种流行性腮腺炎，就是特别，与众不同嘛。玛丽·简小姐说，那是崭新的一种。”

“怎么叫崭新的一种呀？”

“因为它跟别的好多种病都掺和到一块儿了。”

“什么别的好多种病呀？”

“哦，比方说，就有麻疹、丹毒、百日咳，还有肺痨、黄疸、脑炎以及其他的等等。我也都说不上来了。”

“我的天哪！他们管这种病叫作流行性腮腺炎吗？”

“这都是玛丽·简小姐说的。”

“嘿，他们为什么一定要管它叫作流行性腮腺炎呀？”

“反正它就是流行性腮腺炎嘛。她一开头得的就是这种病。”

“嘿，这简直是胡扯。有一个人开头只是绊了一跤，把脚指头碰伤了，后来中了剧毒，掉在一口井里，脖子给摔断了，脑浆也流出来，这时有个人过来问此人是怎么死的，其中一个傻瓜就回答说：‘嘿，他是脚指头碰伤才死的。’你说这话有一点儿道理吗？呸，这是胡扯。刚才你说的这一套，也是毫无道理。难道说这种病真的会传染给人吗？”

“会传染给人吗？得了，真亏你说得出来，我问你：暗头里的一台齿耙，会不会招惹人呀？你只要一碰上它，不是被这个齿儿挂，也一定被另一个齿儿挂住，是不是？得了，这种流行性腮腺炎，就像一台齿耙，你会说——还是一台很不赖的齿耙哩。你只要一过来，就会被它挂住了，永远都甩不掉。”

“我觉得这可太吓人了，”豁嘴子说，“我会去找哈维伯伯——”

“是的，不错，”我说，“我要是你，我当然也会去。一分钟也耽误不得。”

“哦，你那么急吼吼，干什么呀？”

“你只要想一想，说不定就明白了。你们的伯伯叔叔，不是非得尽快赶回英国去吗？你们以为他们会那样缺德透顶、自顾自先走了，却让你们自个儿长途跋涉去吗？你们知道他们一定会等着你们。到目前为止，一切还算顺顺当当。你们的哈维伯伯是个牧师，可不是？那敢情好，难道说身为一个牧师，为了让玛丽·简小姐获准登船，他就能说假话，欺骗小汽船上或是大轮船上一名管票务的职员吗？现在，你们知道他是断断乎不会那样的。那么，他会怎么办呢？你们听着，他一定会说：真是太遗憾了，我教堂里的许多事务，只好暂时劳驾他们尽力照应下去了，因为我的侄女恐怕已经传染上可怕的综合性[2]新型流行性腮腺炎了，所以，我就应该坐在这儿等上三个月，看看她到底是不是得了这种病。不过，这都没有关系，要是你们觉得顶好告诉哈维伯伯一声的话——”

“算了吧，明摆着我们到了英国都可以过上好日子，却偏偏要整天价赖在这儿，一边鬼混，一边等着瞧玛丽·简小姐有没有得了病？嘿，你真像蠢货在说话呀。”

“那么，不管怎么样，也许你们最好还是说给几个邻居听去吧。”

“听着，你这是什么话呀。你简直是天生的大傻瓜，难道你不知道他们会去乱说一通吗？现在简直没辙了，只好压根儿不要说给别人听。”

“哦，也许你说得不错——是的，我觉得你的话很有道理。”

“不过，我觉得我们还是应该告诉哈维伯伯一声，说姐姐她只出去一会儿，反正别让他老是对她不放心吧。”

“是的，玛丽·简小姐正想关照你们这么做。她说：‘转告她们替我给哈维伯伯和威廉叔叔问好，替我亲吻一下他们，说我到河对岸串门去了，是看望那位——’那位姓什么什么的先生——你那彼得伯伯老是牵挂着的那个有钱阔佬，他姓的是什么来着？——我是指那个——”

“哦，谅必你是指阿普索普家，可不是？”

“是的，当然咯。他们这种姓真讨厌，好像让人几乎老是记不住。不错，她是说过她去河对岸请阿普索普家里的人，拍卖的时候叫他们务必上这儿来，把这幢住宅买下来，因为她知道她彼得伯伯觉得与其让别人买去，还不如落在他们手里为好。她打算跟他们多磨蹭磨蹭，好让他们答应届时一定到场。随后，她只要觉得自己还不算太累，就马上赶回家来，要不明儿一大早，她也总得回来的。她说过，只好说她上阿普索普家去了，千万别提普罗克特家——其实，这样说也挺合情合理，因为她原本是上那儿撺掇他们买房子的事去了。我知道得最清楚也没有，因为所有这些都是她亲自告诉我的。”

“好吧。”说完这句话，她们就出去等她们的伯伯叔叔，打算把姐姐代问好和亲吻他们的嘱托，以及有关劝买房子的信息，一一告诉他们。

现在，一切都已安排停当了。那两个姑娘一定会守口如瓶，因为她们心里都想到英国去。国王和公爵也乐于让玛丽·简出去为房子拍卖一事效劳，否则她在家里就会给罗宾逊大夫撞见了。我心里觉得痛快极了。我估摸我这一招非常棒——我觉得就算汤姆·索亚亲自出马，谅他的招数也不见得会更棒哩。当然咯，也许他会做得更漂亮些，不过我可没有那么大的能耐，反正谁都没有点拨过我。

那天下午，他们就在广场上举行拍卖，拖拖沓沓，没完没了，一直硬撑到天快黑下来的时候。那个老头儿也亲临现场，站在拍卖人身边，脸上的表情显得假虔诚极了；他不时插上基督教《圣经》里头一两句话，或者是假正经地乱扯一通；公爵也在那儿咕咕咕地乱叫唤，竭力博取人们同情，借此机会大献殷勤。

没有多久，总算是大功告成，所有的东西全都卖光了，只剩下墓园里一小块破地皮。可是连它他们也非要卖掉不可——我可从没见过国王有如长颈鹿那样，恨不得把所有的东西通通吞下去。正当他们讨价还价的时候，有一条汽船靠岸了，不到两分钟工夫，只见从那边过来了一大群人，一边大声呐喊，一边哈哈大笑，而且还唠唠叨叨，乱叫乱嚷着，说：

“你们的对手来啦！原来老彼得·威尔克斯有两组继承人——你们就掏出钱来挑选吧！”

第二十九章


他们接来了一位容貌不俗的老先生，还有一位稍微年轻些的人，模样儿也好看，只是右胳膊上绑着绷带。哎呀，他们那帮人乱叫乱嚷，纵声狂笑，越来越喧闹，简直是没完没了。可我却看不出这有什么好笑的，我估摸国王和公爵也未必觉得发噱。我原以为他们一定会吓得脸色煞白了，殊不知他们脸色一丁点儿都没有变。公爵尽管心里猜疑来势不妙，可他也不故作镇静，却是反而显得很高兴、很得意，简直着了迷，活像一把咕嘟咕嘟倒出乳酪来的壶。至于国王呢，他只是黯然神伤地两眼直瞪着那新来的两个人，好像他一想到天底下居然还有那样的骗子和流氓，就觉得自己在闹胃痛似的。嘿，他这一招耍得真够迷人的。有好多有头有脸儿的人，全都走了过来，集聚在他四周围，让他知道他们是站在他那一边的。刚到这儿的那位老先生，满脸露出困惑不解的神情。过了半晌，他就开始说话了，一听他的发音，我就知道他像个英国人——他说话跟国王很不一样——虽然国王仿冒的那一口英国话也很不赖。这位老先生的话我可背不出来，他的说话腔调我也写不了；可是，当他转过身来，对着那一群人，好像是这么说的：

“这件事可真是我始料所不及的。我坦白地承认，现在我只好对它暂时不回应，不答复；因为我和我弟弟出了不幸事故，他把胳膊给摔断了，昨天夜里我们的行李又被人弄错了，给丢在这儿上游的某个镇上了。本人是彼得·威尔克斯的哥哥哈维，这一位是他的弟弟威廉，他呀又聋又哑——如今只剩下一只手还可以活动，所以连打手势也打不了多少。我们说我们是什么人就是什么人，准错不了；等我行李一取回来，我就能证明了。反正不到那个时候，我什么话也不想多说，现在我就到旅馆去等着。”

说罢，他跟这个新来的哑巴扭头就走了。国王扑哧一笑，就这样胡说乱诌了一通：

“他胳膊给摔断了——装得倒很像真的，可不是吗？一个非靠打手势不可的骗子，偏偏还没学会怎么个比划——这可也说得真的太离谱了。而行李又给丢了！就眼前这些来说，那实在是太妙了！——聪明得也太出格了！”

话音刚落，他又扑哧一笑，大家也跟着他笑，只有三四个人，说不定有六七个人，却是例外。他们里头有一个就是那位医生，另一个是一位长相机灵、有身份的人，手里拿着一只旧式毡制手提包，刚从汽船上下来，这时他正在跟那位医生低声交谈，偶尔投向国王一瞥，双方都点点头——这个人就是到路易斯维尔去的那位律师莱维·贝尔。还有一个五大三粗的彪形大汉，原来他走过来先是听完了那位老先生说的话，现在正在听着国王胡扯。等到国王扯完了，这个彪形大汉就过来问他：

“喂，你先听我说：你要是哈维·威尔克斯的话，那你是什么时候到这个镇上来的？”

“朋友，我是在出殡的前一天到的。”国王说。

“是在那天什么时候呢？”

“是在那天傍晚——太阳下山以前一两个钟头光景。”

“那你是怎么来的？”

“我从辛辛那提搭乘‘苏珊·鲍威尔’号轮来的。”

“得了吧，那天早上你又怎么坐着小划子——到上游那个岬角去了呢？”

“那天早上，我压根儿没到过上游那个岬角呀。”

“你这是撒谎。”

有好几个人冲他蹦过来，求他跟一位半老的牧师说话时休得无礼。

“好一个该死的牧师。他是一个说谎大王，又是个大骗子。那天早上，他分明到上游的岬角去了。我家就住在那儿，可不是吗？反正当时我是到过那儿的，他也是到过那儿的。我就在那儿看见过他。他跟蒂姆·柯林斯，还有一个小孩儿，坐着小划子一块儿去的。”

那位医生就过来说：

“海因斯，那个孩子你要是见过的话，还认不认得他呢？”

“我想也许认得，可我也说不准。哦，在那边的不就是他吗？我看上一眼，就把他给认出来了。”

他用手指着的就是我。那位医生就说：

“各位乡邻，我可不知道新来的那两位到底是不是骗子；不过，如果说这两个家伙不是骗子的话，那就算我是白痴好了，我的话说完了。我认为，我们责无旁贷，不把这件事弄清楚，绝不能让他们两个跑掉。来吧，海因斯；来吧，还有你们各位。我们把这两个家伙带到旅馆去，让他们跟那另外两个人当面对质，我估摸不等到对质完了，我们就能发现一些名堂。”

大家一听，全都乐不可支，虽然国王的伙伴们听了也许乐不起来；于是，我们全体都出动了。这时候，太阳快要落下去了。那位医生搀着我的手走，他好歹对我还算客气，可他决不把我的手放开。

我们大家一块儿来到旅馆里的一个大厅里，点燃好几支蜡烛，把新来的那两个人也给找来了。打头炮的是医生，他说：

“我可并不想给这两个人太多难堪，不过，我认为他们一定都是骗子，说不定他们还有同伙，我们却全都蒙在鼓里呢。如果说他们真的还有同伙的话，那么，彼得留下的那口袋钱，会不会让他们的同伙早就拿走了呢？这并不是一点儿都不可能的。如果说这两个人不是骗子的话，谅他们也不会反对我们派人去把那些钱取回来，交给我们保管，一直到证明他们全都没问题时为止——你们看这么办，好不好？”

大家全都赞成这么办。所以，我揣想，他们一开头就把我们这两个骗子逼入窘境了。不料国王却面有忧色地说：

“各位先生，我也巴不得钱还在那儿，因为我无意阻挠大家对这起不幸的事件，进行公正的、公开的、全面彻底的调查。可是，我的天哪！钱早已不在那儿了；要是不信，你们尽管派人去看。”

“那么，钱在哪儿？”

“谁知道呢，我的侄女刚把钱交给我替她保管，我就拿着钱藏到我床铺的干草垫褥里头去了；当时，我觉得在这儿也待不了几天，所以不想把它存入银行；同时我又觉得床上这个地方也很保险，我们从来没使唤过黑人，还假想他们像英国佣人一样手脚挺老实呢。殊不知转天一大早，我下楼以后，那些黑人就把钱偷走了。等我把他们卖掉的时候，还不知道钱已失窃了，所以他们就带着那些钱，早已逃得无影无踪了。这件事不妨让我的佣人在这儿跟各位说一说。”

医生和另外好几个人都说：“简直是胡扯！”我看见大家个个都不相信他的话。有一个人问我有没有见黑人偷钱了。我说：“没有。”我说我只看见他们偷偷地从房间里出来，慌慌张张地跑掉了，我从来也没有想到别的什么，我只是揣想，他们深恐把我的主人给吵醒了，所以没等到他对他们发火就拼命跑掉了。他们问过我的，就是这些话。随后，那位医生又转过身来，问我：

“你也是英国人吗？”

我说是的；他和另外好几个人都哈哈大笑，说：“去你的！”

随后，他们开始一般性调查，我们就让他们翻来覆去地查问了一个钟头，接下来又是一个钟头，谁都只字不提吃晚饭，看来谁也没想到——他们就这样继续不断地调查下去，这真是你从没见过的最要不得的糊涂账。他们要国王自述生平经历，随后让那位老先生也自述生平经历；除了一小拨偏见很深的傻瓜以外，谁都有目共睹：那位老先生说的都是实话，而国王说的却是谎话。过了一会儿，他们让我出来，把我所知道的事也说一说。国王从他眼角边向我投来一个居心叵测的眼色，我完全拎得清他暗示我说话要对路。我就开始说到有关设菲尔德的情况，我们在那里如何过日子，寡居英国的威尔克斯一家人又是如何如何，如此等等，不一而足。不过，我还没有说多少，那位医生却开始哈哈大笑起来；那位律师莱维·贝尔就说：

“坐下吧，傻孩子，我要是你的话，就不白费劲儿啦。我估摸，谅你对说谎很不习惯，看来说得非常不顺口；你还得多多练习练习哩。现在你说起来还不太乖巧。”

像这样的恭维话，我倒是一点儿也不感兴趣，可是不管怎样，他们饶了我，说真的，我心里可高兴极了。

那位医生忽然想要说些什么话，就转过身来说：

“莱维·贝尔，你要是一开头就在镇上的话——”

国王一边插嘴，一边伸过手去，说：

“哦，这一位就是我那可怜的先兄的老朋友吗？他生前写信时常常提到您。”

这位律师就跟他握握手，还微微一笑，看来挺高兴似的。他们紧接着交谈了片刻，稍后还跑到一边去悄悄地说话。到了最后，律师就大声说：

“那就一言为定。我就把您的授权证明书，连同令弟的一块儿递上去，那他们就知道没问题啦。”

于是，他们取来一些纸和一支笔，国王就坐下来，脑袋歪到一边，嚼着舌头，乱七八糟地涂写了一些，稍后又把笔递给公爵——这时，公爵才头一次面有难色了。可他还是照样把笔接过去，信手乱涂了一通。于是，律师掉过头去，向新来的那位老先生说：

“请你跟你弟弟也写上一两行，再签上名字吧。”

这位老先生写完了，可是他写的字谁也不认得。律师大惊失色地说：

“唉，这可让我真伤脑筋了。”——他从口袋里掏出来一叠旧信，仔细查看了一下，随后又仔细查看了那位老先生的笔迹，接着再仔细查看那些旧信，于是，他说：“这些旧信都是哈维·威尔克斯写的；现在这儿有两种笔迹，不过，谁都看得出来这些断断乎不是他们写的。”（老实告诉你，国王和公爵一见自己落入律师的圈套，脸上立时显露被出卖的傻相。）“这儿就是这位老先生的笔迹，但不管是谁一眼都看得出来，这些断断乎不是他写的——事实上，他所涂抹的笔触，压根儿不像写的字。各位不妨来看一看，眼前这几封信，是从——”

那位新来的老先生说：

“请你们让我解释一下，好吗？我写的字，除了我弟弟以外，谁也不认得——所以他就专门替我抄信的。你们拿着的那些信，上面写的字都是他的笔迹，不是我的。”

“乖乖！”那位律师说，“这事可真是怪得出奇。得了吧，我这儿还有好几封威廉写的信；你只要叫他写上几行，我们不妨比——”

“他的左手可不会写字，’那位老先生说，“他的右手现在要是管用的话，你们就会看得出来，他自己的信跟我的信，全都是他写的。请你们把这两种都看看——反正出于同一个人的手笔。”

律师果然都看了一下，说：

“我想问题是这样的——如果说不是一个人写的，反正还有好多相似之处，以前我可没留意到。好，好，好！我原以为这个问题我们马上就要解决了，不料现在差不多又成了泡影。可是不管怎么样，有一件事已得到了证实：这两个家伙都不是威尔克斯家里的人。”说罢，他就朝着国王和公爵一个劲摇头。

得了，你猜怎么着？那个死顽固的老傻瓜，到了此时此刻还不肯认输！说到底，他愣是不服气。他说这种检验方法很不公平。他说他弟弟是天底下最该死的、净爱开玩笑的行家，他压根儿就不打算一本正经地写——他常常看到，威廉只要在纸上一动笔，准会又开个大玩笑来着。于是，他就干脆铆着劲儿，唠唠叨叨地说下去，说真的，他所说的那些话，连他自个儿都渐渐相信了——可是，过了一会儿，那位新来的老先生突然插话，说：

“我可想起一件事来了。这儿有没有人一块儿帮着入殓我哥——我的意思是说，有没有人一块儿帮着入殓那位刚断了气的彼得·威尔克斯呀？”

“有啊，”有一个人说，“是我跟阿布·特纳一块儿殓尸的。现在我们人都在这儿。”

于是，那位老先生掉过头去，对国王说：

“也许这位先生可以告诉我，彼得的胸口留有什么样的暗记吧？”

国王要是不赶快鼓起勇气来，他就真的该死，要不然他准会一下子垮掉了，就像一道陡岸被河水抽底儿给冲垮了似的，因为老先生这一问毕竟使他觉得太突如其来了。——你要知道，不拘是谁如果冷不防碰到这么个烫手的问题，差不多都会招架不住——因为他怎么会知道这个死人身上还留着什么样的暗记不暗记呢？他的脸色一下子有点儿发白了。他这是实在出于万般无奈呀。这时候全场肃静无声，人人身子都往前探了出来，目不转睛地直瞅着他。他暗自思忖，这一回他该认输了吧——再瞎诌也不管用了。嘿，你猜他真的认输了吗？说出来怕谁都不信，他愣是不认输。我估摸，他一定是想就这样硬顶软磨地拖下去，拖得这些人又乏又累了，他们都会渐渐离去，那时，他和公爵也可以脱身，溜之大吉了。不管怎样，他还是待在那儿，过了半晌，他才微微一笑，说：

“嘿，这个问题可真烫手呀，是不是？是啊，先生，你听着，我这就告诉你，他胸口留着什么样的暗记吧。那只不过是一个又小又细的蓝箭头——就是这一点儿玩意儿罢了；你要是不凑近仔细看，什么你都看不见。现在，你还想说些什么——嘿？”

唉，像这个老流氓那样死不要脸的东西，反正我从来都没见过。

新来的这位老先生来了劲儿，赶紧转过身去，朝着阿布·特纳和他的搭档，两眼炯炯发亮，好像他自以为这回可把国王抓住了，他说：

“喂——他的话你们全都听见了吧！彼得·威尔克斯的胸口有那样的暗记吗？”

他们俩异口同声地说：

“我们可没看见过那样的暗记。”

“那敢情好！”老先生说，“现在，你们就听我说吧。你们在他胸口真的看见过的，是一个小小的、模模糊糊的字母‘P’跟一个‘B'（这个首字母，他在年轻时就不用了），还有一个‘W'，这三个字母中间都夹着两个破折号。”这时，他就在一张纸上这么写着：“P——B——W”。“你们二位说说吧——你们看见过的，是不是这个暗记？”

他们俩又是异口同声地说：

“不，不是的。我们压根儿就没见过什么暗记不暗记。”

嘿，这一下可把大家都惹恼了。他们就大声嚷嚷，说：

“这一帮子全都是骗子！我们把他们扔进水里去！让他们都给淹死！要不然用杠子抬着他们游街去！”大家顿时大喊大闹，简直是喧声鼎沸。不料，律师却立时跳到桌子上，大声喊道：

“各位先生——各位先生！且听我说一句话——只说一句话——就算给我个面子吧！现在还有一个办法——我们去把尸体挖出来看看就得了。”

他的这些煽情话一下子让大家来了劲儿。

“对啦！走吧！”大家七嘴八舌地大声嚷嚷，马上就要出发了；可是，律师和医生却高声说：

“且慢！且慢！揪住这四个大人和一个小孩子，也带着他们一块儿走！”

“敢情好，就这么办吧！”大家全都一块儿嚷着说，“我们要是找不着暗记，就给这帮子人动私刑！”

我老实告诉你，那时候我可真的吓得要死。可是要想逃跑，又谈何容易，你知道。他们紧紧地抓牢我们，径直往大河下游一英里半的墓地赶，因为我们大吵大闹，喧声震天，所以差不多全镇的人都尾随在我们后头，这时候也才不过是晚上九点钟。

我们打从我们那幢住宅走过的时候，我心里真巴不得玛丽·简要是没有离镇外出该有多好呀，因为此时此刻，我只要给她使个眼色，她就会跑出来救救我，让这两个骗子倒霉。

我们沿着河边的大道径直往前赶，乱吵乱闹真的赛过一大群猞猁似的。这时候，天突然阴下来了，闪电开始一闪一闪的，树叶子被风吹得瑟瑟发抖，让人觉得更加害怕。这么可怕、这么危险的窘境，我可从来也没见过呢。我觉得有点儿晕头晕脑，什么事情都跟我原先设想的不一样；此时此刻，我不但不能笃悠悠地隔山观虎斗，到了紧要关头，又不会有玛丽·简出来替我撑腰，把我救出来，让我恢复自由；而且，我也只好乞灵于他们那些所谓忌讳的暗记，以免死于非命。但是，万一他们什么暗记也找不着的话——

我可真的不敢继续想下去了；但是不知怎的，这一件事，我不去想它又不行。天色越来越黑，本来这是偷偷溜走的绝好机会；不料，那个五大三粗的彪形大汉抓住了我的手腕子——那个叫海因斯的家伙——谁都休想从他手里溜掉，这就像从歌利亚[1]的手里挣脱掉一样难。他拽着我急吼吼往前赶，瞧他那种亢奋劲儿，要跟上他的脚步，我就不得不老是一溜小跑。

我们终于来到了墓地，就一窝蜂似的簇拥了进去，好像河里涨大水，到处泛滥一样。他们一到坟墓跟前，才发现铁锹多带了一百多把，提灯一个都没捎来。但是借着闪电的亮光，他们就动手挖了起来，另外派人到半英里远的邻近人家去借提灯。

他们拼命地、不停歇地挖了又挖；这时候，天色已经黑得怪吓人，雨也开始下了，风飕飕地刮个不停，而且闪电越打越快，轰雷隆隆地直响；可是他们那些人压根儿视若罔睹似的，他们个个都在埋头忙活哩；电光忽闪一亮，这一大群人的每一张面孔和每一件东西，还有墓穴里挖上来的一锹一锹的泥土，你都会看得清清楚楚；稍后，电光骤然一暗，黑暗又笼罩着一切，你就什么也看不见了。

最后，他们好歹把棺材挖出来了，就动手松开螺丝钉，掀开棺材盖。接着又是彼此推搡、挨挤、倾轧，简直乱成了一团。哪一个都想钻到前头去一，此种情状你呀可真没见过，特别是在漆黑一团的夜里，真是太吓人了。海因斯他又是拉，又是拽，让我的手腕子简直痛得要死；他激动得连气都喘不过来，我估摸他早已把我忘得一干二净了。

蓦然间，一道雪亮的电闪划破了天空，只听见有人大声嚷着说：

“老天爷作证，那口袋金币还在他胸口呀！”

海因斯跟众人一样大吼一声，放开了我的手腕子，拼命地往前冲过去了一眼；我趁着一团漆黑，马上撒腿就跑，直奔大道而去，此情此景恐怕谁都说不上来。

大道上空荡荡，只有我一个人，所以我简直好像是腾飞起来了——除了我以外，这条大道上只能见到一片漆黑，还有忽闪忽闪的耀眼的电光；雨正在刷刷地下，风正在呼呼地吹，再加上一阵阵震耳欲聋的大霹雳；说真的，我一直在往前飞呀飞的！

我到达小镇上的时候，正好大风大雨，一个人也看不见，所以我压根儿也不去偏僻街道，只要顺着大街一直飞奔好了；等我快要到达我们那幢住宅的时候，我老远地就对着它直奔而去。一点儿亮光也没有；整幢住宅都是黑糊糊的——让我心里感到难过、失望，但我却说不出所以然来。可是到最后，我正要打从边上走过去的时候，一道耀眼的亮光突然从玛丽·简的窗子里一闪而过！我的心儿猛地升腾起来，仿佛快要飞出来似的；也在这一刹那，那幢住宅以及一切的一切，却全都甩在背后黑暗之中，再也不会呈现在我眼前了。她真是我所见过的最可爱、也是最有胆量的姑娘。

我一赶到离这个小镇上头更远一点儿的地方，看得见我可以去的沙洲的时候，我就开始东张西望，打算借一只小船；电光忽闪一亮，我看得见有一只没有锁住的小船，就连忙把它弄过来，朝着沙洲划过去。那是一只小划子，什么也没有，只有一条绳子拴着。那座沙洲位于河中央，离岸还远得很，所以我要争分夺秒才好。等我最后划到木筏边上的时候，我已经疲乏极了，要是条件许可的话，我真想躺下来喘喘气。可是我并没有那么做。我一跳上木筏，就大声喊道：

“吉姆，快出来，解开缆绳！谢天谢地，我们好歹把那两个骗子甩掉了。”

吉姆跑了出来，伸开两条胳膊来搂抱我，他简直是乐不可支了。可是我借着闪电的亮光，瞅了他一眼，我的心儿简直快要蹦到嘴里来了，不觉往后一退，就掉到河里去了，因为我已经忘了他是一身两役，兼做老李尔王与淹死的阿拉伯人了，我的五脏六腑差点儿都让他给吓掉了。随后，吉姆把我打捞上来，还想要搂搂我，祝福我一番，他之所以感到喜出望外，一是我又跑回来了，二是我们终于把国王和公爵都给甩掉了。可是我说：

“且慢，且慢——吃完早饭再说，吃完早饭再说！切断缆绳，快往下游漂去！”

眨眼间，我们就顺着河流漂下去了；我们俩又能自由自在地在大河上漂流，再也没有人来惊扰我们，该是多么轻松愉快。我情不自禁地到处乱蹦乱跳，我高兴得跺起脚来，简直是按捺不住了。大概是我第三回跺脚的时候，忽然听见一个我最熟悉的声音——吓得我连大气也不敢出。听着，等着——接着，只见又一道闪电把水面都给照亮了，我看见，准没错，他们又回来了！——这时，他们正在拼命地划桨，使那只小船咯吱咯吱地乱响！原来小船上果真就是国王和公爵。

于是，我一下子泄了气，扑倒在木板上，我已是万念俱灰了；恕我只好这么着，才没有失声大哭。

第三十章


他们刚跳到木筏上，国王就冲我而来，揪住我的衣领猛摇不止，说：

“哼，打算乘人不备时溜掉，是吧，你这个狗崽子！跟我们在一块儿待腻了，是不是？”

我说：

“不是的，陛下，我们岂敢岂敢——请您息怒——陛下！”

“那就快一点儿，给我说出来，你到底出的是什么点子，要不然我就把你的五脏六腑都给摇出来！”

“陛下，我一定把这件事的来龙去脉都告诉您，说的全是真话。抓住我手的那个人对我可和气极了，他老说他也有个孩子跟我一般大，不过在去年死掉了，他看到像我这样的孩子处在如此险境，心里就觉得难过。他们突然找到了那些金币，冲着棺材奔过去的时候，他就放开我的手，低声耳语地对我说：‘现在快跑吧，不然他们准定把你绞死！’所以我就撒腿跑了。其实，我待在那儿，看来也不会有什么好处——我简直是没辙了，既然可以临阵脱逃，我又干吗待在那儿等绞死？所以，我就一口气奔到河边，踅摸到那只小划子；等我来到了木筏上，就叫吉姆赶快离开，否则他们还会把我抓起来绞死。我跟吉姆说，你和公爵怕是活不成了；我心里难过极了，吉姆也一样。刚才我一看见你们俩又回来了，真有说不出的高兴，不信你就问问吉姆，我说的是不是这样。”

吉姆说确实是这样的；可是国王要他闭嘴，说：“哎呀，你说得可真的像煞有介事呀！”接着又猛摇着我，他说还不如干脆把我淹死得了。不料，公爵却说：

“把这个孩子放开吧，你这老糊涂虫！换了是你，难道就不跑了吗？你溜掉的时候，问过他的下落了没有？我可不记得你问过。”

国王这才把我给放了，就开始把那个小镇，和小镇上的人挨个儿都骂了一通。可是公爵却说：

“你还是狠狠地骂你自个儿吧，因为最该挨骂的就是你。你从一开头起就没干过一件有头脑的事儿，除了你死不要脸地挖空心思想出来的那个蓝箭头记号，倒是真高明——那确实是棒极了，好歹救了我们的命。要不是施出了那一招，他们准把我们关押起来，等那个英国人的行李一到——那时候——管保去坐大牢，准没错！可是你耍了个诡计，把他们都引到墓地里去，多亏那口袋金币又帮了我们大忙；因为那几个见钱眼红的傻瓜蛋，要不是急忙放开我们的手，冲过去看那口袋钱的话，我们今儿晚上早就打上领带[1]睡着了——那也就是刽子手的绞索——比我们常用的领带可要长得多呢。”

他们顿住了一会儿——各自在想心事——稍后，国王有点儿心不在焉地说：

“哼，我们还估摸是那几个黑鬼偷走了呢。”

这句话一下子让我心惊肉跳！

“是啊，”公爵用慢条斯理、从容不迫、还略带挖苦的口吻说，“我们也估摸是他们干的呢。”

过了半分钟左右，国王拉长调门说：

“至少——我是那么估摸的。”

公爵也用同样的腔调说：

“不见得吧——我才那么估摸呀。”

国王就有点儿恼火地说：

“喂，比奇沃特，你这算什么意思？”

公爵倒也很干脆利索地说：

“就说这件事吧，我倒是要问问你，你到底是算什么意思？”

“呸！”国王却带着挖苦的口吻说，“我压根儿不知道——说不定你睡着了吧——连你自己干过什么事全都不知道啦。”

公爵立刻气势汹汹地说：

“得了吧，别再谈论这件让人讨厌的事——不要拿我当作一个大傻瓜，好吗？你以为我不知道是谁把钱藏到棺材里头的吗？”

“是啊，先生！我知道你准知道——反正就是你自个儿呗！”

“你这是胡扯！”公爵一下子向他冲过去。国王大声嚷嚷，说：

“快撒手！——别掐我的脖子呀！——就算我没说过，好不好！”

公爵说：

“好吧，你先得爽爽快快地承认，确实是你把钱藏到那儿的，你打算不准哪一天把我甩掉，独个儿再回转去，把它挖出来，就好自己独吞了。”

“且慢，公爵——你先回答我这一个问题，一定要光明正大，老老实实地说，你要是确实没有把钱搁在那儿，你就一是一，二是二地实话实说，我一定会相信你；我刚才说的话通通收回，也就得了。”

“你这个老流氓，我压根儿没有呀，你也不是不知道。你瞧，这就得了吧！”

“得了，得了，我相信你。不过，你再要回答下面这个问题——你先别生气：你心里是不是想要先把它弄到手，随后再藏起来？”

公爵顿时一言不语，过了一会儿才说：

“哦，我就算是那么想也不要紧，反正我没有那么干。可是你不但心里想要那么干，而且，事实上也真的那么干了。”

“公爵，说句良心话，那事如果说是我干的，我就不得好死呗。我不说我不打算那么干，因为我确实有过那样的打算；可是你呢——我是说别人——已经抢在我前头干了。”

“你这又是在胡扯！是你干的，那你就得说是你干的，要不然——”

国王的嗓子眼里开始咯咯发响，过了一会儿，他气喘吁吁地说：

“够了，够了吧！——我承认就得啦！”

听了他这句话，我真是高兴极了；我顿时觉得要比刚才轻松得多了。于是，公爵就撒开手，说：

“你要是再敢抵赖，我就淹死你。本来你就应该待在那儿，哭哭啼啼活像小伢儿——瞧你自个儿干的鸟事，真是活该。我从没见过像你这样贪婪的老鸵鸟，恨不得把所有的东西都一口吞下去——我还一直信得过你，把你认作我的亲爹呢。你明明知道人家把偷钱的事都推到那几个可怜的黑人身上去，你却袖手旁观，一句话也不替他们申辩，你自个儿应当感到害臊呀。想到我自己头脑太简单，竟然相信了你的屁话，真让我觉得可笑。你这该死的东西，现在我才闹明白了，你为什么急着要把短缺的钱都给补上——原来你打算让我把演《皇家尤物》挣来的，还有从别处赚来的钱通通拿出来，你就好一股脑儿都卷走呀。”

国王就缩头缩脑地说着，至今还有点儿假惺惺的样子：

“怎么啦，公爵，当时是你说要把短缺的钱都给补上的，可不是我说的呀。”

“住口！我再也不想听你胡扯啦！”公爵说，“现在你瞧，你自己落了个什么下场呀。人家不但把属于自己的钱都找回去，而且还把我们所有的辛苦钱也一块儿兜着走了，我们手里只剩一两个铜子儿啦。快睡你的觉去吧——往后你尽管缺钱，可再也别跟我要补缺！”

于是，国王就鬼鬼祟祟地钻进窝棚里去，端起酒瓶子解闷儿；过了一会儿，公爵也去喝他那瓶酒去了；约莫过了半个钟头，他们俩又亲热得像什么似的了，反正他们越是醉醺醺，就显得越是亲密，到后来干脆搂在一起，鼾声如雷。他们两个早已酩酊大醉，可是我发觉：国王尽管已是烂醉如泥，还是念念不忘公爵所说的那句话，不让他再抵赖那口袋钱是他藏起来的。这么一来，倒也让我心里觉得非常轻松，非常满意。等他们进入鼾睡的时候，我们当然也就神聊了老半天，我把这件事原原本本地全都告诉了吉姆。

第三十一章


一晃眼好几天了，我们再也不敢在哪一个小镇上停靠，只好顺着大河往下漂流。到后来，我们来到了暖和的南方，离开家乡已经老远老远了。我们开始碰到许多长满苔藓的树木，苔藓从树枝上垂下来，赛过长长的灰白色胡子。这是我头一遭看见树上长着这种苔藓，它们让树林子显得分外萧索凄凉。所以，这两个骗子以为他们已经脱离了险境，又打算到村子里去坑骗人。

他们一开头就来了一场有关戒酒的演讲，可是他们到手的赚头还不够他们喝一盅的。他们又到另一个村子里去办跳舞学校，可是他们对于跳舞知道得并不比袋鼠更多些；所以，他们开头刚做了一两个蹦跳动作，那些要跳舞的人就连跳带蹦地过来，把他们两个从村里撵出去了。还有一回，他们打算教授演讲术，不料他们刚开了腔没多久，听演讲的人就一哄而起，狠骂了他们一顿，当即把他们赶走了。他们还干过传教、讲道、行医、算命，样样玩意儿都沾过一点儿边，可是看来他们老不走运。到后来，他们简直穷得要死，整天价躺在木筏上，一边顺着水流往下漂，一边心里瞎琢磨，有时整整半天一句话也不说，老是灰不溜丢、走投无路的样子，真够吓人的。

最后，他们的举止言谈突然来了个大转变，他们在窝棚里交头接耳，嘀嘀咕咕地谈起话来，而且谈得很入迷，一谈就是两三个钟头。吉姆跟我心里都有点儿七上八下。我们真不喜欢看到那种德行。我们暗自揣想，他们一定是在那儿琢磨什么更不像话的恶作剧。我们翻来覆去推测，最后断定他们准是打算闯进某某人家里或是铺子里去抢钱，或是去印造伪币，或是去干别的什么勾当。这一下我们可给吓坏了。我们俩已经商量好，断断乎不跟他们一块儿搞鬼，只要稍微有一点儿机会，就给他们来个措手不及，拔脚就跑，溜之大吉，把他们甩在后面远远的。得了，有一天大清早，我们在一个名叫派克斯维尔的破败不堪的小村镇以南约莫两英里处，踅摸到一个挺安全的地方，把木筏隐藏起来。国王就上了岸，关照我们都躲在那儿等着；他说自己进村里去刺探一下虚实，看看那儿是不是有人听到了有关《皇家尤物》的风声。（“你该不是想去打家劫舍吧，”我暗自思忖道，“料你抢好了跑回来的时候，你就不知道吉姆跟我，还有这排木筏，都到哪儿去了——到了那时候，你就只好傻眼了。”）他还说，万一他到了晌午还不回来，公爵和我就可以尽管放心进村里去好了。

于是我们就在木筏上等着。公爵顿时露出焦急不安的神情，脾气也变得坏极了。他动不动就开口骂我们，好像我们做什么事老是做得不对头，每一件鸡毛蒜皮的小事，他都要穷挑刺儿。他准定又在挖空心思动坏念头了。到了晌午，国王连影儿也没有，我心里喜滋滋的，高兴极了；不管怎么样，我们好歹可以松动松动了——也许紧跟着还有这种松动的机会哩。于是，我跟公爵就一块儿进村里去，四处找寻国王，到最后终于发现他在一家下等的小酒吧的后间里，早已喝得醉醺醺的。有一拨游手好闲的二流子，正在欺侮他，拿他逗着玩儿，可他却在死劲儿又是骂街，又是唬人；瞧他早已喝得酩酊大醉，自己连两脚都迈不开步，对他们简直一点儿辙也没有。公爵就开始骂他老浑蛋，国王也马上还嘴对骂开了；正当他们吵得顶起劲儿的时候，我从小酒吧里溜了出来，撒腿就跑，差点儿让我后腿没抽筋，顺着河边的大道像小鹿似的往前飞奔——因为我知道我们的机会已到了。我暗自琢磨，从此以后，他们要想跟我和吉姆再见面，真不知道要到哪年哪月了。我一口气奔到河边，早已累得喘不上气来，可是心里却充满喜悦之情，我就大声嚷道：

“吉姆，给木筏解开缆绳吧，我们这回可好啦！”

偏巧没有人应答，也没有人从窝棚里走出来。吉姆早已不翼而飞了！我铆着劲儿喊了一声——再喊了一声——跟着又是一声；我跑进树林子里，一边拼命呐喊，一边尖声呼唤，可是一点儿也不管用——老吉姆连影儿也没有了。我只好坐在地上哭起来——我这是早已按捺不住了。可是我不能老在那儿待着不动。过了半晌，我又走到大道上，想要琢磨出个好办法来；这时候，有个孩子迎面走过来，我就问他有没有看到一个陌生的黑人，身上穿着怎么怎么样的衣服的。他说：

“是的，看到过。”

“他上哪儿去了？”我问。

“他到离这儿以南二英里的赛拉斯·费尔普斯家里去了。他是个逃跑的黑人，被他们抓住了。你正在找他吗？”

“我才不找他呢！大约一两个钟头以前，我在树林子里见过他，他说我要是大声嚷嚷的话，他就把我的五脏六腑都给挖出来——他叫我躺倒在地上，不准动，所以，我只好就这样待在那儿，一直不敢走出来。”

“那就得了，”他说，“现在你用不着害怕啦，因为他们已把他抓住了。他是从南方一个什么地方逃出来的。”

“他们把他抓住，倒是敢情好啊。”

“哦，那倒也是！谁抓住了他，就可领赏二百块钱。那笔钱简直就像在路上白捡了一样。”

“是啊，一点儿没错——我要是个儿大一些，也可以得到那笔赏金的；本来就是我头一个看见他的。到底是谁抓住他的？”

“是一个老家伙——一个陌生的外地人——他把自己的活宝以四十块钱的价格，卖给了别人，因为他还得赶到河上游去，再也等不下去了。你想想看，该有多蠢！换了是我的话，哪怕等上七年也行。”

“我也一样，那还用说嘛，”我说，“不过他把这活宝卖得那么便宜，也许是它压根儿只值那么一点儿钱。说不定这里头还有什么名堂呢。”

“断断乎没有——一点儿也没有。那张传单我是亲眼目睹过的。那上头把他一切的一切，都说得清清楚楚——简直把他活灵活现地给画出来了，说他是从新奥尔良以南某个种植园里逃出来的。先生，你尽管放心吧，那笔投机买卖断断乎出不了差错。喂，给我一口烟叶子嚼嚼，好吗？”

我哪儿有烟叶子呢，所以他一扭头就走了。我又回到了木筏上，坐在窝棚里反复琢磨，可是到头来什么也琢磨不出来。我一直琢磨到头昏脑涨了，还是没法走出这一窘境。想一想，我们赶了这么远的路，给他们两个流氓拼死地干活，到头来还是一场空，什么都成了泡影，全是因为他们两个心太狠，对吉姆设下了这样的骗局，只为了那四十块臭钱，叫他一辈子流落异乡，再过奴隶的苦日子。

以前我也这样暗自思忖过：吉姆要是不得不当奴隶的话，那么，他还不如回老家去当奴隶，守着一家老小过日子，总比在外面鬼混要好上千百倍，所以，我最好给汤姆·索亚写封信，让他把吉姆的下落转告沃森小姐。可是过后我把这个念头又给打消了，原因有两个：沃森小姐因为吉姆从她那儿逃走，觉得他流氓成性，忘恩负义，从而对他又气恼又憎恨，于是就会再把他卖到大河下游去。就算她还不见得会那么做，别人对一个忘恩负义的黑人，自然也会不屑一顾，于是，他们就会整天价给吉姆颜色看，让他觉得自己低三下四，丢人现眼。随后，再回过头来想想我自己！人家既然都知道我哈克·费恩帮过一个黑人去寻找自由，所以，我要是再见到那个小镇上的人，谅我随时都要汗颜，无地自容，只好趴下来苦苦求饶了。原来无非就是这样：一个人做了一件不可告人的事，却又不敢承担后果。他老是自己琢磨，那件事只要他能捂住盖子，也就不算是丢脸。眼前我的窘境正好就在这里。反正越是琢磨这件事，我的良心就越受折磨，我也越发觉得自己心眼儿坏，下流，没出息。到了最后，我蓦然间觉得上帝掴了我一记耳光，让我知道我的罪恶自始至终受到上帝的监视；当时我把从没伤害过我的一个可怜的老妇人手下的黑人拐出来，上帝始终监视着我，而且还启示我休得继续作恶多端，切莫走得太远了——我一转念想到这里，差一点儿没厥倒了，我委实吓得要死。于是，我就竭尽全力来安慰自己，我想我从小受的教养要不得，所以这也不好全都怪我；可是我心里有个声音，老是不断对我说：“哪儿都有主日学校嘛，你本来是可以去上学的，你要是去了，他们就会教育你，像你这样帮着黑人逃跑的人，是会受到永久的火刑惩罚的。”

我一想到这里，不觉得浑身发颤。我差点儿下决心要做祷告，看看我能不能弃恶从善，做一个好孩子。于是我就两膝跪下，偏偏祷词怎么也想不出来。这究竟是什么原因呢？我可用不着瞒上帝，也用不着瞒我自己。我为什么没话可说呢，我可知道得很清楚。那都是因为我心术不正，因为我有私心杂念，因为我一直表里不一，耍两面派。我假装着要涤尽罪恶，可是内心深处包藏着就数它最大的坏念头。我老是想让我的嘴巴说我愿意做些规规矩矩、清清白白的事情，赶快给那个黑奴的主人写信，告诉她眼下他在哪个地方；可是我内心深处知道这是谎话——这一点上帝也都知道。你断断乎不能对上帝说谎话吧——这一点我总算是领悟了。

所以说，我心里委实充满为难情绪，到了无以复加的境界，简直使我茫然不知所措。最后，我好歹想出一个点子来了；我说，我不如先写那封信，过后再看看自己能不能做祷告。哦，这可真是神极了，我立时心情轻松得有如一支翎毛似的，我所有的为难情绪涣然冰释了。于是，我拿了一张纸、一支铅笔，兴高采烈地坐了下来写：





沃森小姐：您那个逃跑的黑奴吉姆，现在是在大河下游，在派克斯维尔以南两英里的地方，已被费尔普斯先生抓住了。您要是派人带着赏金来取人，他就会交还给您。

哈克·费恩





我心里顿时觉得很痛快，好像所有的罪恶都已洗涤干净了，我有生以来头一遭获得如此轻松的感受，我知道现在我可以做祷告了。可是我并没有立时就做，我把那张纸放下，坐在那儿仔细想了好半天——我想幸好经过刚才这一切变故，要不然我差点儿就迷途了，堕入地狱。我就这么着想下去，后来不知怎的想到了我们顺着大河往下游漂流的情景；我看见吉姆，不管是白天黑夜，有时在月光底下，有时在暴风雨里，总是跟我形影相随；我们顺水漂流的时候，常常是一边唠扯，一边唱唱歌，一边哈哈大笑。可是，不知怎的好像我总是看不出有什么地方，好让我对他冷若冰霜，恰好相反，我老是念叨着他的好处。我看见他自己刚值完了班，也不过来叫我，就替我值班，好让我继续安睡下去；我还看见过，当我从大雾里跑回来时他又是那么高兴的样子。再有，在河上游那个世代族仇的滋生地，我在沼泽地里又来到了他跟前时，他又是多么高兴，还有好多好多类似这样的事情；他总是管我叫作小宝贝，常常呵护着我，但凡他想得到的事，一桩桩、一件件，都替我做了，他这个人委实是太好了。最后，我又想起了那一回我告诉人家说船上有人出天花，结果他总算得救了，当时他对我感恩不尽，说天底下就数我是老吉姆最好的朋友，还说现在他只有我这个独一无二的好朋友。这时候，我偶尔一回头张望，一眼就看到了那张招贴纸。

这委实让人进退两难。我把它捡了起来，拿在手里。我浑身上下瑟瑟发抖了，因为我得下决心，在这两者之间作出选择，永不后悔，这个道理我是知道的。我平心静气地思考了一会儿，随后就自言自语地说：

“那么，得了，我就下地狱吧。[1]”——我一下子就把它撕个粉碎了。

这是怪可怕的想法，也是怪可怕的话，但是我已经说出口了。而且一言既出，我就断断乎不改口，也不再想什么弃恶从善这等事了。我把这件事通通撇开不想了；我已拿定主意再走邪道，反正走邪道我最内行，从小就耳濡目染过，做别的什么反而一窍不通。我打算先想想办法，把吉姆给偷出来，免得他重新当奴隶；我要是还想得出更坏的事情来，我照样也会干的，因为反正是一不做，二不休，既然要干，我就索性干到底。

接着，我就开始仔细地思考，究竟从何处着手才好；我心里翻来覆去想过了好多好多的办法，最后才确定了一个自己觉得合适的方案。于是，我就先测定好离河下游不远一个树木茂盛的小岛的方位，等到天色一黑下来，我悄悄地把木筏撑过去，到了那儿找个地方隐藏起来，随后钻进窝棚里去。我睡了一整夜，天没亮就爬起来了；我吃过早饭，穿上了我那套现成衣服，再把别的一些衣服和零碎东西，打成一个包袱，坐上小划子，就划到河对岸去了。你瞧，那边有一所房子，我估摸，准是费尔普斯住的地方，我就在房子南边上了岸，把那个包袱藏在树林子里，又让小划子装满河水和石头一块儿沉到河底去，等到要用的时候再把它打捞上来也不迟。那个沉船的地点，在河岸上一家小锯木厂以南大约四分之一英里处。

随后，我就朝着大道往前走去，我走过那家锯木厂时，看见厂门口挂着一块招牌，上面写着：“费尔普斯锯木厂”。我又往前走了两三百码，来到了那些农户人家院子跟前，就睁大眼睛四处张望，可是一个人也见不到，尽管此刻早已是日上三竿了。可我还是觉得并不要紧，因为这时候我不打算见到什么人——只想看看附近这一带的地势罢了。按照我的方案，我要让人们看出：我是打从那个村子走过来，不是从河南边上来的。我只是看了一看，就直奔村镇而去。不料，我刚刚到那儿，我碰见的头一个人却是公爵。他正在张贴《皇家尤物》的海报——连演三个夜场——跟上回一样。瞧那两个骗子，他们还是那么死不要脸！我跟他撞了个满怀，想躲也来不及了。他大惊失色地说：

“哈啰！你——你打从哪儿来的？”稍后，他略带高兴、关切的口吻说：“木筏在哪儿呀？——把它藏在一个好地方吗？”

我就说：“怎么啦，大人，我还正要问你呢？”

看来他一下子就不那么高兴了——他说：

“你干吗会想到问我？”

“且慢，你先听着，”我说，“昨天我在小酒吧里见到国王的时候，我暗自琢磨着：等他醉后再醒过来，少说也得好几个钟头，才好把他弄回家去。所以，我就在村镇上逛来逛去，无非是打发时间傻等着。有一个人走过来，给了我十个美分，叫我帮着他把一只小船摇到河对过去，再把一头绵羊给运回来，于是，我跟着他一块儿去了。可是，我们正拽着那头羊上船的时候，那个人却把缆绳交给了我，自己跑到羊后头去推一把，不料那头羊的力气特大，我拽不动，一松手，它猛地往上一蹿就跑了，我们俩赶紧追上去。我们没有带上狗，所以只好在野地里到处追赶；一直到天快黑下来了，那头绵羊也乏累了，我们俩才把它逮住，并从河上运回来。这时候，我再上那边去找木筏，定神一看，它连影儿也没有了。我暗自琢磨着：‘错不了，他们又闯了祸，所以不得不赶快开溜；他们把我的黑人带走了——我在世界上仅仅有那么一个黑人；现在我独自流落在异乡，两手空空，什么玩意儿都没有。简直没得办法活下去了。’所以，我就只好坐在地上哭起来了。后来不知怎的，我在树林子里睡了一整宿。可是话又说回来，那木筏到底上哪儿去了？——还有吉姆——可怜的吉姆！”

“真该死的，我怎么会知道呢——我这是说，我怎么会知道那木筏上哪儿去了？原来那个老白痴做过一回买卖，得了四十块钱，后来，我们走进小酒吧找到他的时候，那些游手好闲的二流子，正在跟他赌半块钱的输赢；结果他除了喝威士忌酒花掉的钱以外，所有剩下的钱全让他们给骗走了。昨天深更半夜里，我才把他弄回去，发现那木筏早已没有了，我们还说：‘那个坏小子把我们甩下，偷了我们的木筏顺着河水漂走了。'”

“我总不能撇下我的黑人吧。是不是？——我在这个世界上，仅仅有这么一个黑人，仅仅有这么一点儿家当。”

“那个我们可从来没想到呢。说真的，我们早已把他看成我们的黑人了；不错，我们果真把他看成我们的——天知道，他给我们招惹的麻烦也真够多的了。当时，我们一看木筏没影儿，我们手上连一个子儿都没有了，所以没有别的办法可想，只好让《皇家尤物》重新上台。我一直拼死地忙活，酒都喝不上，嘴巴里干得像牛角制火药桶似的。你那个十美分硬币在哪儿呀？快给了我吧。”

反正我钱还有好多呢，我就给了他十个美分，可是我央求他拿去买些吃食，也要分给我一点儿，因为我拢共只剩下这几个子儿，从昨天起一直到此刻还没吃过东西。他还是一气不吭。过了一会儿，他猛地转过身来，跟我说：

“依你看，那个黑人会去告发我们吗？他要是真敢去的话，我们非剥他的皮不可！”

“他怎么能去告发你们呀？他不是早已跑掉了吗？”

“不，他没跑掉！那个老白痴把他给卖掉了，一个子儿都没分给我，可钱也通通没有了。”

“把他给卖了？”我刚说完就哭起来了，“哼，他是我的黑人，那些钱也该是我的。他在哪儿呀？——我要我的黑人。”

“得了吧，反正你是找不着你的黑人啦——所以嘛，你哭也白搭。你且听着——你想一想，你会不会去告发我们？依我看，你真该死的靠不住。哼，你要是胆敢去告发我们的话——”

他沉吟不语了，公爵的眼睛里顿时凶光毕露，我可从来都没见过。我还是抽抽噎噎地哭着说：

“我压根儿也不想去告发谁，反正我可没有那么多的闲工夫。我还得四处去找我的黑人呢。”

看来他有点儿犯愁似的，站在那里，一边动脑筋，一边皱眉头，搭在胳膊上的海报，被风刮得猎猎响。到了最后，他才说：

“我这就告诉你，我们还得在这儿待三天。你只要答应不去告发我们，也不让那个黑人到处乱说，那么，我就告诉你上哪儿去找他。”

于是，我就一口答应了。他说：

“原来有一个庄稼人，名字叫作赛拉斯·费——”说到这儿，他就顿住了。你瞧，他开头想要跟我说实话，可是他忽然顿住，稍后又是仔细地琢磨，又是思考了一会儿，我估摸他肯定要变卦了。果真没有错，他真是信不过我，他本想笃笃定定地让我在整整三天期间不要碍手碍脚，所以，他马上就说：

“把他买下来的那个人，名叫阿伯拉姆·福斯特——阿伯拉姆·C·福斯特——此人住在离这儿四十英里的乡下，就在通往拉斐德[2]的那条大路旁边。”

“好吧，”我说，“我在三天以内就可以走到了。今天下午，我就动身。”

“不，那可不行，你此刻就得动身，一秒钟也耽误不得，一路上也不得乱嚼嘴皮。你要牢记着，只管闭住了嘴巴赶路，那你就不会给我们惹祸了，你听见了没有？”

他的以上这些吩咐，对我来说，不但正中下怀，而且也是求之不得。我正巴不得我能独立不羁地去实现我的方案。

“那你赶快就走吧，”他说，“你跟福斯特先生随便说什么都行。也许你能说服他，让他相信吉姆确实是你的黑人——有些傻子压根儿不要查看证件的——至少我听说在南方不少地方，确有这样的傻瓜蛋。你要是告诉他，那张传单和悬赏都是假的，再给他解释一下，干吗要耍这一套花招，也许他就相信你的话了。现在，你走吧，你爱跟他说什么就说什么好了。可是你要记住，一路上你千万不要嚼舌根。”

于是，我就离开那儿，冲着人烟稀少的乡下走去。我并没有频频回头张望，可是我觉得好像他老在盯着我。不过我知道我也能让他乏累得要死。我在野地里一溜小跑，多达一英里地远，方才驻足不前。接着，我掉过头来，穿越树林子，折回费尔普斯锯木厂。我估摸，我最好立即按着方案进行，再也不能浑浑噩噩下去了，因为我要在这两个家伙滚开以前，堵住吉姆的嘴巴才好。我可不愿意跟他们那号人招惹麻烦了。我早就把他们看透了，现在我就是想要把他们完全摆脱掉。

第三十二章


我到达那里的时候，四下里都静悄悄的，好像是礼拜天似的。这时候，天气炎热，骄阳当空——帮工们都下地去了。有好些虫子和苍蝇在空中飞来飞去，还发出一片微弱的嗡嗡声，让人觉得更加死气沉沉，好像这里的人全都命赴黄泉了。一阵微风刚吹过，树叶子就颤动起来，让你不觉感到阴风惨惨的，因为你会觉得仿佛鬼魂们在低声耳语似的——那些死了不知已有多少个年头的鬼魂——你老是估摸着他们还在对你评头论足呢。一般说来，这种死气沉沉的氛围，让人巴不得一命呜呼，方才万事皆休了。

费尔普斯家的种植园，就是当地许多种植棉花的小型种植园里头的一个，反正这些种植园看上去都是一模一样。一块两英亩大的场院，四周围着一道栅栏；有一排台阶，是用截短了的圆木倒立着搭成的，这些一根比一根高的圆木倒立在那里，好像高矮不齐的木桶似的，踩着它就可以跨过栅栏，女人们也可以踩着它骑到马上去。这个大场院里，还有一片片枯萎的草地，但大部分地面上都是光秃秃的，好像一顶磨掉了绒的旧呢绒帽子。一座特大的木头房子，是给白人住的——用的全是锛制圆木，裂缝里都嵌着泥或是灰浆，那一条泥缝上当初还曾粉刷过。一间圆木搭建的厨房，通过一道宽大的走廊，跟那特大木头房子连接起来；走廊的两侧都是敞着的，但上面却有罩棚。厨房后头有一间木头搭成的烟熏室[1]。烟熏室旁边，有一长溜三间黑人住的小木屋，紧挨着后面栅栏，还有一间孤零零的小屋；那栅栏另外一边，还有一些外屋。小屋旁边有一条贮液槽，和一只煮肥皂液的大壶[2]。厨房前长条凳上，有一桶水和一只瓢，有一条狗一边晒太阳一边在睡觉，周围还有好几条狗，也都睡着了。在远处一个角落里，大约有三棵绿树，栅栏附近有一块地方，长着加仑子和醋栗树丛。栅栏外边是一个菜园子和一块西瓜地；再过去就是棉花地；棉花地的外面，则是一片树林子。

我就绕道过来，跨过紧挨着贮液槽的后面台阶，直奔那间厨房。我还没有走多远，就听见一架纺车好像呜呜咽咽似的转动着，它那单调沉闷的声音时高时低，不绝如缕，此时此刻我真的恨不得索性一瞑不视了——因为它是世界上最让人肝肠寸断的音响。

我径直往前走去，心里并没有谱，但愿老天爷保佑，到时候我说的话字字句句恰到好处；因为我早已发觉，只要我放得开，老天爷老让我说话很有分寸。

我刚走到半路时，有两条狗一前一后冲我扑过来，当然我只好马上站住，面对着它们，一动也不动。它们汪汪地又乱吠了一通！刹那间冷不防又过来了十五条狗，把我团团地围在当间儿，你会说，我好像成了车轮中的毂，那些狗赛过一根根辐条；——它们在我周围紧紧地挨挤在一块儿，伸长着脖子、鼻子，冲我乱叫狂吠；此外还有好多狗也往这边奔过来。你会看到，有的隔着栅栏蹦过来，有的从栅栏拐角处兜过来。

有一个黑人妇女，一阵风似的从厨房里跑出来，手里拿着一根擀面杖，大声喊着说：“滚开！小虎崽！小花点儿！去吧，快点儿！”于是，她挨个儿揍了它们一下，揍得它们乱吠着跑了，剩下的那些狗也都尾随着跑开了。眨眼间，那些狗里头有一半又都跑了回来，围着我一个劲摇尾巴，向我套近乎来着。你瞧，狗的心眼儿可真是一点儿也不坏呢。

跟在这个女人背后，跑过来三个黑人小孩子，两男一女，他们身上除了一件粗亚麻布衬衫以外，别的什么都没穿。他们紧紧地拽住妈妈的长衣裙，躲在她背后偷偷地看着我，有点儿怯生生，反正黑人小孩子总是这个样子的。这时，屋子里跑出来一个白人妇女，论岁数，大约是在四十五到五十之间，头上没戴帽子，手里拿着一支纺锤，跟在她背后的是她的几个白人小孩子，也有一点儿忸忸怩怩的，跟那些黑人小孩子一模一样。她笑得简直前俯后仰，仿佛连站都站不稳似的——她说：

“你终于来了！——不是吗？”

我也就只好不假思索地说：“是的，太太。”

她一把抓住我，紧紧地搂住我，随后攥住我的两只手，一遍又一遍地握个不停。她热泪盈眶，扑簌满脸；她老是搂着我，握着我的手，好像总是嫌不够，还絮叨不休地说：“你长得可不大像你妈，我真没想到；可是，我的天哪，我也不去管那个了，看见了你，我才真的高兴！哎哟哟，哎哟哟，好像我恨不得把你一口吞下去！孩子们，这就是你们的老表哥汤姆！——快跟他说一声：‘您好啊。'”

不料，他们猛地低下头，把手指头含在嘴巴里，躲到她背后头去了。于是，她就接下去说：

“莉莎，赶快热早饭给他吃，别磨蹭——要不然也许你在船上已经用过早饭了？”

我说在船上用过了。于是，她就搀着我的手，朝那所房子走去，孩子们都跟在后头。我们到了那里，她让我坐在一把用薄木条做的椅子里，攥着我的两只手，说：

“现在，我尽管可以好好地看看你啦；我的天哪，一晃过去了这么多年头啦，我总是盼星星，盼月亮，这回可算是把你盼来了！我们等着你已经等了两三天啦。什么事把你缠住啦？是船搁浅了吗？”

“是的，太太——那条船——”

“别再叫我太太——管我叫莎莉阿姨吧。船是在哪儿搁浅啦？”

我可不知道该怎么说才对头，因为我压根儿不知道那条船是从上游开下来的，还是从下游开上来的。可是我只好全凭直觉说了算；我的直觉说它是上水船——从下游新奥尔良一带开上来的。不过，这也帮不了我大忙。因为我可不知道，那一带沙滩滩名都叫什么来着。我估摸，我得杜撰一个滩名，要不干脆说我把搁浅了的滩名给忘掉了——要不——我忽然灵机一动，计上心来，随即脱口而出，说：

“搁浅——倒是没有耽误多长时间。我们船上有个汽缸盖爆炸了。”

“哎哟哟，我的老天哪！伤人了没有？”

“没有伤人。只不过炸死了一个黑人。”

“哦，总算是不幸中的大幸；因为有时候是免不了要伤人的。两年前的圣诞节，你的赛拉斯姨父搭乘老拉拉·鲁克[3]号，从新奥尔良上来，那条船上一个汽缸盖也爆炸了，把一个人给炸成瘸腿了。我估摸那个人后来死掉了。他还是浸礼会教徒哩。你的费拉斯姨父认得巴吞鲁日[4]的一户人家，那一家老小跟我们家里的人也很熟悉。哦，不错，我可想起来了，这个人确实是死掉了。后来因为坏疽，医生只好给他截肢了。可是那也救不了他一命。是的，就是因为坏疽了——准没错。他浑身都是青一块、黑一块，临死时还寄厚望于日后自己能荣耀地复活呢。听说他那副样子，才叫惨不忍睹！你的姨父天天去镇上接你。他不到个把钟头以前又去了。他不准什么时候就要回来了。想必你在路上碰见过他吧？——一个岁数不小的人，带着——”

“没有呀，莎莉阿姨，什么人我都没碰见。那条船拂晓时就靠了岸，我把行李撂在浮码头上，就到镇上转了一转，还到野地里去溜达溜达，无非是多消磨一点儿时间，到这儿来也不会太早了；所以，我就干脆打从后头绕着过来了。”

“你把行李有没有交给谁呀？”

“没有交给谁。”

“哎哟哟，孩子，那准定给人偷去了！”

“我把它藏在一个好地方，我估摸准偷不了。”我说。

“你在船上怎么一大早就用早饭了？”

她这一问，可真是让我有点儿如履薄冰似的，可是我说：

“那位船工看见我在那儿站着，就招呼我最好先吃一点儿东西再上岸；所以，他把我领到最高甲板舱船长餐厅里，给了好多我正想吃的东西。”

我心里越来越忐忑不安，连人家的话都听不真切了。我一直在那几个孩子身上动脑筋；我想要把他们支到外边去，不断盘问他们，闹个清楚我到底是谁。可是我一点儿也没有机会，费尔普斯太太总是盘根究底，没完没了。过了一会儿，她又问了下面这些话，一股冷飕飕的寒气，简直从我后背上骤然袭来：

“我们在这儿唠了好半天，可是姐姐跟你们家里随便哪一个人，你连一个字儿都还没提到呢。现在，我想先歇一会儿，且听你从头说起：把所有的事情全都告诉——把他们所有的人的事，通通说给我听——不管是他们里头的哪个人的；比方说，他们眼下好不好，他们平日里做些什么，他们关照你跟我说些什么话来着；但凡你想到的事，不管巨细深浅，通通说给我听听吧。”

唉，我知道自己一下子又给难住了——我简直一点儿都没辙了。老天爷一直保佑我，还没出过差错，可现在我才算是真的搁浅了。我知道，再硬撑下去，一点儿也不管用——我只好举手投降了。所以，我暗自琢磨，我又一次被逼入绝路，我也就只好实话实说了。我刚要开口说话，她却猛地抓住我，把我推到床背后，说：

“他回来了！你快把头低下去——哦，这么着就得啦；现在谁都看不见你啦。可别让人知道你就在这儿。我想跟他开个玩笑。孩子们，你们连一句话也不准说呀。”

我知道，现在我已是进退两难。可是光犯愁也不管用；我简直一筹莫展，只好闷声不响，老老实实地待着，等到闪电一过去，随时准备起来。

那位老先生走进来的时候，我只是稍微瞥了他一眼，随后他就被那张床遮住了。费尔普斯太太猛地站了起来，问他说：

“他来了吗？”

“没有呀。”她的丈夫说。

“我的老——天——哪！”她说，“他到底会不会出了什么事？”

“我可想不出来，”老先生说，“我可得跟你说，这件事真让我揪心。”

“揪心！”她说，“我几乎快要急疯啦！他准定来过了；你在路上准跟他错过啦。我知道就是这么回事——好像是天神捎话给我似的。”

“怎么啦，莎莉，我断断乎不会在路上跟他错过的——这你总该知道呀。”

“可是，天哪，天哪，姐姐又会说什么来着！想必他已来过啦！你准跟他错过去啦。他——”

“哦，我心里已够难受的了，你可别再给我雪上加霜啦。我可真不知道这是怎么回事。我已全然不知所措了，我就算承认自己吓得要命，我也无所谓。可是，他到这里来，看来是没有希望了！正因为他不能来了，所以我就没有碰到他。莎莉，真吓人呀——确实吓人——肯定那条船出事啦！”

“喂，赛拉斯！你看那远处！——那条大路上！那不是有人走过来了吗？”

他赶紧蹿到靠床头的窗边，费尔普斯太太就趁此机会，连忙弯下腰来，从床脚边把我一下子给拽出来了。等他从窗边转过身来，只见她笑吟吟地站在那里，满脸涨得红彤彤的。我缩头缩脑、汗流浃背地伫立在一旁。那位老先生瞪着两眼看了一下，说：

“嘿，这是谁呀？”

“你说说这是谁呀？”

“我可说不准。到底是谁呀？”

“这就是汤姆·索亚呀！”

我的天哪，我差点儿没栽倒在地板底下去。可是我简直连换花枪的工夫都没有，那位老先生就抓住我的手，握了又握，握个不完；那个女人却围着我们，一边手舞足蹈，一边哈哈大笑，一边大叫大嚷；随后，他们俩急巴巴地盘问了我好多话，把锡德·玛丽，还有家里其他的人，个个都问到了。

不过，就算他们那么乐不可支，那还远远地比不上我满怀喜悦之情，因为我仿佛觉得自己喜获新生似的，现在我才知道他们都把我认作谁啦。他们愣是抓住我不放，盘问了两个钟头；最后，连我下巴颏儿都乏累了，再也说不下去了，反正有关我家里的事——我指的是汤姆·索亚家里的事——我全都告诉过他们了，而且比汤姆·索亚家里的实况还要多上六倍。我还详细地说了一遍，我们船上那个汽缸盖在白河口怎么爆炸，花了三天时间才把它修好。这个谎话编得可真是呱呱叫，他们听了果真深信不疑，因为他们压根儿也不知道，修理汽缸盖干吗要三天时间。如果我当时把它说成是一只螺栓头爆炸了的话，他们也照样会信以为真。

现在，我一面觉得心情非常舒畅，一面又觉得心情非常不舒畅。充当汤姆·索亚的替身，固然真够痛快淋漓，事实上，我也一直觉得真够痛快淋漓；可是没有多久，我忽然听见一条汽船哼哧哼哧地从上游开下来——我不由得暗自思忖道：万一汤姆·索亚就是坐这条船来呢？——万一他一走进来，没等我给他递个眼色，让他先不要开口，冷不防他大喊特喊我的名字呢？

哦，我可不乐意见到那样——那是断断乎要不得的。我非要去大路上拦住他不可。于是，我跟他们说，我想到村子里去取行李。那位老先生本想陪我去，可是我说，不用劳驾了，我自己也会赶马车，请他老人家不必多虑了。

第三十三章


于是，我就赶着马车去村里了。我刚走在半道上，就看见一辆马车从对面过来，一点儿都不错，汤姆·索亚果然来到了。我就让马车停住，等他过来。我吆喝了一声：“停住！”那辆车就在我车边停住了，只见他嘴巴张开，像箱子口那么大，愣了一会儿，随后，他咽了两三口唾沫，仿佛是润一润嗓子眼似的；接着，他才说：

“我可压根儿没有伤害过你。这个你心里是知道的。那你又干吗跑回阳间来缠住我呢？”

我说：

“我可不是又跑回阳间来——我压根儿就没去过阴间。”

他一听到我的话音，好像有点儿恢复平静了，可是他仍然不太放心。他说：

“你可千万不要来惹我，因为我压根儿不想来惹你。说老实话，你到底算不算是个鬼？”

“说老实话，我可不算是鬼。”我说。

“好吧——我——我——好吧，那当然就不该再成问题啦。可是，不管怎么样，我好像还是闹不清楚。你且听我说，难道你压根儿就没让人家害死吗？”

“没有。我压根儿就没让人家害死——我只不过存心捉弄他们罢了。要是不信，你过来摸摸我就得了。”

于是，他真的过来摸了一摸，心中疑团立时消散了。他觉得能跟我见面重逢，真有说不出来的高兴，简直不知道如何才好。他恨不得马上知道这件事的前后经过，因为它是一段了不起的冒险经历，又是如此神秘，本来就合他的口味。可是我说，姑且把它搁一下，以后再说也不迟。我关照他的车夫不妨等一会儿，我们让马车往前稍微挪动了一下，我就把我目前的窘境如实相告，请他点拨究竟该怎么应付才好。他说，让他好好想一想，可不要打扰他。于是，他想了一想，不一会儿开了腔说：

“敢情好啊，我有个好点子了。你不妨把我的衣箱搬上你的车，就假称是你的行李。你掉过头去，慢慢悠悠地往前磨蹭，可要算准回程必需的时间，不早不晚回到他们那里。我呢打算先往村里走一小段路，随后再掉过头来往回赶，估计比你要晚到一刻钟，或是半个钟头。刚见面的时候，你假装你不认得我就得了。”

我说：

“好吧，不过还得等一会儿。因为还有一件事——这件事，除了我以外，谁都不知道。那就是说，眼下有个黑人，我想把他偷走，免得他再去当奴隶——他的名字叫作吉姆——就是沃森老小姐手下的吉姆。”

他说：

“怎么啦！那个吉姆在——”

他顿住了，开始琢磨起来。我说：

“我知道你要说什么来着。你会说那是卑鄙、下流的事儿；可就算是那样，又有什么关系呢？——下流，我就算是下流吧；可我要把他偷出来，我还要求你守口如瓶，不要泄密。好不好？”

他眼睛里顿时闪闪发亮，说：

“我就帮你把他偷出来！”

得了，我一听这话，好像挨了一枪似的，简直一点儿都支撑不住了。这真是最让人吃惊的话，我可从没听见过——说老实话，汤姆·索亚在我心目中的威信，已大大地下降了。不过他的这句话，我是不相信的。汤姆·索亚怎么会偷黑人呢！

“得了吧，别胡扯，”我说，“你这是开玩笑。”

“我可不是开玩笑。”

“那么，好吧，”我说，“不管是开玩笑也好，还是不开玩笑也好，你要是听人提到那个逃跑的黑人，可千万记住，就说你一点儿都不知道，我也一点儿不知道。”

随后，他就把他的衣箱搬上我的车，于是，我们就各归各上了车，分头赶路去了。殊不知我因为太高兴了，满脑子胡思乱想，却把应该走得慢点一事给忘了。我回到家里来，时间也太快了，好像没走过远路似的。我那位老先生正站在大门口，他说：

“哦，这可真是了不起呀！真没想到这匹马会跑得那么快。要是把时间记录下来该有多好。你瞧，它身上一点儿汗水都没有——连一根鬃毛也没湿。真了不起。现在这匹马呀，就是给一百块钱，我都不卖；老实说，我断断乎不卖的。可是前一阵子，要是有人出价十五块钱，我准把它卖了，而且我还估摸它充其量也不过就值那么几个钱呢。”

他说的就是这些话。他是我亲眼目睹过的最天真的一个老好人。可是这也并不出人意料，因为他不仅仅是个庄稼人，而且还是个牧师，在他的种植园后头，有一座小不点儿圆木搭建的教堂；那是他自己掏钱亲手修造的，既是教堂，又可兼做办学校舍；平日里他讲道，历来分文不收，而且还讲得非常地道。在南方就是有好多类似这样种庄稼、传道两不误的牧师，全都跟他一模一样。

过了约莫半个钟头，汤姆的马车赶到了屋前的台阶跟前，莎莉阿姨从窗子里就看见了，因为当时只不过隔开大约五十码光景。她说：

“哦，有人来了！我暗自纳闷，真不知道到底是谁呀？哦，我估摸准定是个远方来的稀客呗。杰米（这是那些孩子里头的一个），跑去告诉莉莎，开饭时多上一客饭菜。”

大家都一块儿冲到大门口去，因为远方的稀客并不见得年年都来，反正大家对这种稀客总比对黄热病更感兴趣。汤姆跨过台阶，朝这幢房子走过来；那辆马车就顺着大路直奔那个村子去了；这时候，我们大家还都挨挤在大门口。汤姆身穿一套现成的衣服，面前有的是围观者——这始终是汤姆·索亚最喜欢的一大乐事。在这种场合，不愠不火地掼点派头，对他来说，简直一点儿也不费劲。他断断乎不会羞答答地踅过场院，像一只小绵羊似的；不，他准是泰然自若地、大摇大摆地踱步过来，活脱脱像一头大公羊。他来到我们跟前时，就高雅大方地把帽子摘下来，好像轻手轻脚地揭开一只盒子盖，生怕惊动了盒子里头睡着了的蝴蝶似的。他说：

“啊，我想，你就是阿基鲍德·尼科尔斯先生吧？”

“不是的，我的孩子，”那位老先生说，“真倒霉，你让那个车把式给骗了。尼科尔斯家离这儿还有三英里多地哪。进来吧，快进来。”

汤姆掉过头去，看了一下，说：“太晚了！——车把式早已没影儿啦。”

“是的，他早已走远了，孩子，你可得先进来坐坐，跟我们一块儿吃饭；随后，我们再套车，把你送到尼科尔斯家去。”

“哦，我可不敢给您添那么多麻烦，我连想都不敢想呀。反正我自己可以走着去——道远一点儿，不要紧。”

“我们可不让你走着去——我们南方人是不作兴这样招待客人的。快进来吧。”

“别客气，进来吧，”莎莉阿姨说，“不会给我们添麻烦的，一点儿都没有。你一定要在这儿歇歇脚。那个三英里路呀又长，尘土又多，我们可不能让你走着去。再说，你还没进门，我就吩咐他们多摆了一客饭菜。所以，你可别让我们扫兴。快进来吧，千万别客气。”

于是，汤姆态度非常诚恳大方，向他们各位道谢，他实在觉得盛情难却，也就进来了。他一进了屋，就说他本人来自俄亥俄州希克斯维尔，名字叫威廉·汤普森——说罢，他又俯身鞠了一躬。

他就唠唠叨叨地说个没完没了，把希克斯维尔的风土人情，以及他胡编乱造的各色人等瞎诌了一通，我听了不禁感到有点儿着急。真不知道他究竟打算如何让我摆脱困境。到后来，他一边还在说着话，一边身子往前探过去，冷不防对准莎莉阿姨的嘴亲了一下，稍后又怡然自得地往椅子里一坐，再接着刚才的话茬儿说下去。莎莉阿姨猛地站了起来，使劲地用手背往嘴上抹了一下，说：

“你这好大胆的小畜生！”

看来他有点儿伤心似的，说：

“真没想到，你怎么还会骂街，太太？”

“你没想——我倒是要问问你，你把我当作什么人呀？本来我是出于一片好心，而且——你倒说说，你跟我亲嘴——是怎么个意思？”

看来他有点儿低声下气地说：

“我什么意思都没有，太太。我一丁点儿恶意都没有。我——我——估摸，你就喜欢让我亲呗。”

“嘿，你从娘胎里就是个嘎小子！”她一把抓起那支纺锤，看她那种来势汹汹的模样儿，只差点儿没砸他。“你怎么会想到我就喜欢让你亲的？”

“得了吧，我也不知道。反正是他们——他们——告诉我你会喜欢的。”

“是他们告诉你我会喜欢的。反正谁告诉你的，谁也是个疯子呗。这种怪话我可真没听见过。那么，他们——究竟是谁？”

“反正是——他们大伙儿呗。他们全都是那么说的，太太。”

她好不容易总算把自己按捺住了。她的两眼一闪一闪，她的手指也一握一放，好像要来捉拿他似的。她说：

“‘他们大伙儿’——是谁呀？快给我报出他们的名字来——要不然就让疯子短寿促命啦。”

他站了起来，不免有些尴尬，来回摸弄他的帽子。他说：

“非常对不起，可真没想到。是他们撺掇我亲的，他们全都那么撺掇我亲的。他们个个都说‘跟她亲亲嘴’；还说，‘她准喜欢的’。他们个个都这么说——一个也没有例外。可是，我真的非常对不起，太太，往后我可再也不敢啦——说真的，再也不敢啦。”

“你呀再也不敢啦，可不是？哼，我谅你也不敢！”

“不，太太，真的不敢啦，我说的是老实话；我断断乎再也不敢那样啦。除非是你来求我。”

“除非是我来求你！呸，这种怪事我可一辈子还没见过哪！我说，就算你赶明儿变成玛士撒拉式[1]老傻帽活寿星，我也不会来求你——或者像你这一号蠢货——跟我亲嘴呀。”

“哎呀，”他说，“实在没想到。不知怎的我总闹不明白。他们都说你喜欢来这一套，我也估摸你是喜欢这一套的。可是——”他沉吟不语，慢慢悠悠地举目四顾，好像巴不得碰到在那儿向他深表同情的目光；于是，他猛地盯住那位老先生的眼睛，说：“先生，您是不是认为她会喜欢让我亲嘴呀？”

“哦，不，我——我——哦，不，我想她断断乎不喜欢。”

随后，他照样还是举目四顾；他一瞅见了我，就说：

“汤姆，难道你不觉得莎莉阿姨本该张开两条胳膊跟我说：‘锡德·索亚——'”

“我的天哪！”她一边插嘴说，一边冲他扑了过去，说：“你这个嘎小子，真会糊弄人——”她正想要搂住他，可是就在这时，他却一抬手把她推开了，说：

“不，这可不行，你还得先求求我呀。”

于是，她一点儿也没坐失时机，赶紧求求他赏个脸，就搂住了他，一遍又一遍地亲吻他，随后还把他推给那位老先生，这么一来，他总算也沾了一点儿余沥。等他们惊魂稍定以后，她说：

“哎呀，我的天哪，我可真没见过如此让人大喜过望的事儿。我们只巴望汤姆要过来，压根儿没想到你也来啦。姐姐的信上只说汤姆要来，别的人压根儿就没提呢。”

“那是因为除了让汤姆来以外，原来没打算让我们里头哪个人也来，”他说，“可是，我求告了一遍又一遍，到了临走的时候，她方才让我也一块儿跟来啦。所以，我和汤姆坐上下水船的时候，就出了个点子，要叫你们大吃一惊，那就是：让他先到府上来，我在后面暂时滞留一会儿，过后再佯装远方来的稀客撞门而入。可是，话又说回来，莎莉阿姨，没想到我们估计错了。一位远方稀客上这儿来，总是很冒昧的吧？”

“不错呀——锡德，像你这么大胆放肆的小东西上这儿来，就是很冒昧的。你真该吃两记耳光子才好；我不知多少年来还没有那么发窘过呢。可是我都不在乎，就算玩笑开得过火，也不要紧——反正只要你肯到这儿来，像这样的玩笑，哪怕是你跟我开上一千回，我也乐意奉陪到底。哼，想一想刚才出的洋相吧！我可不否认，当时你狠狠地亲我一下，吓得我差点儿没得命啦。”

我们就在住宅和厨房当间那个宽敞的走廊里共进午餐；餐桌上摆满了菜肴，可供七户人家享用——而且还都是热气腾腾的；断断乎不会有那种肉头老、啃不动的荤菜，在潮湿的地窨子餐柜里过了一夜，转天早上吃起来，好像厚厚一大块又老又冷的生肉似的。赛拉斯姨父面对这些菜肴祷告了好半天，不过还是值得一听，反正那些热菜一点儿也没受凉——不知有多少回我看见过别人家祷告做完了，餐桌上的吃食也全都凉了。

那天整整一个下午，大家我一言，你一语，谈得可真不少。我跟汤姆时时刻刻都在留神观察，可是全都不管用：他们一点儿都没扯到什么逃跑的黑人的事，我们也不敢把他们引到那个话题上去。不料，就在吃晚饭的时候，有一个孩子说：

“爸爸，我跟汤姆和锡德一块儿看戏去，好不好？”

“不好，”老先生说，“我估摸恐怕不会有什么好看的了；就算有的话，你们也都去不得，因为有关演戏骗人的丑闻，那个逃跑的黑人全都告诉我跟伯顿了，伯顿说他要告诉大家千万别上当，所以，我揣想人家早就把那些死不要脸的流氓从村子里给轰出去了。”

原来事情早已昭然若揭！——可是我呢也是无能为力了。他们让我跟汤姆一块儿睡在一个房间、一张床上。我们因为乏累得很，晚饭刚吃完，跟他们说了一声明儿见，就上楼睡觉去了。可是没有多久，我们就从窗子里头爬出来，顺着靠墙的避雷针滑下去，飞也似的直奔那个小村镇，反正我不相信有人会给国王和公爵通风报信，所以，我要是不赶快去给他们捎个话，他们准要倒霉。

在路上，汤姆原原本本地都告诉了我，说人家揣测我已被人杀害了，又说老爸在案发以后不久即告失踪，从此再也没回去；此外还有，吉姆逃跑的时候，当地竟然闹得个满城风雨。至于我们演《皇家尤物》的那两个浑蛋，还有赶着木筏航行的情况，我也一五一十地告诉了汤姆。等我们来到了村子里，并从村子当间儿横穿而过——这时候已有八点多钟了——只见一伙人举着火把，如痴似狂地簇拥过来，一边大声呐喊，一边尖声怪叫，而且还敲打铁皮锅，吹着洋喇叭。我们立刻躲闪到一旁，让他们过去。他们打从我们身旁走过的时候，我看见人们用杠子抬着国王和公爵游街——这就是说，我心里有数，那准定是国王和公爵，尽管这时他们浑身涂满柏油，黏着羽毛，一点儿都不像活人模样儿了——倒是很像两支又粗大、又吓人的鸡毛掸子。哦，看了一眼，我心里就怪恶心的；我替这两个穷光蛋感到难过，好像对他们再也不好硬心肠了。目睹上述惨状，着实让人不寒而栗。人与人之间竟然真的会残忍到如此骇人的境地啊。

我们知道已经来不及了——简直一点儿辙也都没有了。我们向一些轧闹猛的人打听过，据他们介绍说，开头大家都装出傻呵呵的样子去看戏，其实四下里早已埋伏好，等到那个可怜巴巴的老国王在台上跳跳蹦蹦，跳得正欢的时候，有人发出了信号，于是全场观众一哄而起，就把他们给抓住了。

于是，我们就慢悠悠地往回走，我心里再也不像开头那样着急了，不知怎的，真该死，总是有点儿窝囊、低人一等似的——尽管我压根儿没做过什么亏心事。不过事情从来都是这样的；至于你做得对还是不对，压根儿没关系，你的良心是没有辨别力的，反正它总要找你来着。如果说我有一条黄狗，也像人的良心那样一无所知的话，那么，我一定用毒药把它弄死。良心在一个人的身上所占的空间，比五脏六腑还要大。可是它一点儿用处都没有。汤姆·索亚他也是这么说的。

第三十四章


我们停止了谈话，仔细地琢磨起来。过了一会儿，汤姆说：

“你且听我说，哈克，我们该有多傻，怎么不早点儿想起来呢？我准知道吉姆在哪个地方。”

“我看不见得！在哪儿呀？”

“就在贮液槽旁边那个小屋里。喂，你且听我说。我们吃午饭的时候，有个黑人拿着一些吃食上那儿去，你没看见过吗？”

“不错，我是看见过的。”

“那么你说送去的吃食是干什么的？”

“是去喂狗的。”

“我想也是那样。不过，那并不是去喂狗的。”

“为什么？”

“因为那里头还有好几块西瓜。”

“不错，不错——西瓜我是见过的。嘿，真是怪得很，我可从没想到狗是不吃西瓜的。这恰好说明：一个人有时是会熟视无睹的。”

“你看，那个黑人进去的时候，先把门锁打开，出来时再把它锁好。我们差不多正要离开餐桌的时候，那个黑人给姨父交回来一把钥匙——我敢说，那就是打开门锁的那把钥匙。送西瓜说明小屋里有人，锁门说明小屋里关着失去自由的人；再说，在这样一个小不点儿的种植园里，人人都很和睦，心眼儿也很好，不见得会把两个失去自由的人关押在这里。所以，那个失去自由的人，准是吉姆。那敢情好——我们仿照侦探的方法，总算把吉姆的下落了解清楚，真的使我高兴极了；我再也不去瞎琢磨别人的办法了。现在，你就动动脑筋，琢磨出一个偷吉姆的方案来，我也要琢磨出一个来；那时，我们就从这两个里头挑一个顶呱呱的。”

一个乳臭未干的小孩子，脑瓜子居然会这么灵！我要是有汤姆·索亚那么灵的脑瓜子，那么，不管是给我一个公爵头衔，或是让我当轮船上的大副，或是做马戏团里的小丑，或是给我想得起来的什么玩意儿，反正我全都不给换呀。可我好歹琢磨出了一个方案，那也只不过是陪衬陪衬罢了；反正我心里明白得很：万无一失的方案将从哪里来。果然不一会儿，汤姆就说：

“琢磨好了吗？”

“琢磨好了。”我说。

“那么，得了——快说出来吧。”

“我的方案是这样的，”我说，“吉姆是不是在那里，我们不难了解清楚。明天晚上，我先把小划子打捞上来，再去小岛上，把我的木筏撑过来。随后，碰到头一个漆黑的夜晚，等那老先生入睡以后，从他的裤袋里把那个钥匙偷出来，我们就带着吉姆，坐上木筏顺流而下，还得采用我跟吉姆从前惯用的昼伏夜行的办法。你说说，这个方案行，还是不行？”

“行还是不行？这当然行，像耗子打架一样，不过也真该死的太简单了，一点儿不过瘾。这么一个压根儿不用费劲的方案，还有什么妙不可言的呢？真是太没有味儿了。哈克，我说，这就好比闯进肥皂厂，有什么玩意儿值得大伙儿议论呢。”

我始终一言不语，因为这原本都是在我预料之中。反正我心里非常明白，他只要把他的方案制订好了，准棒，无懈可击的。

果然不出所料。他把他的方案告诉了我；乍一看，我就觉得他的方案确实不俗。单说气派，就超过我的十五倍，而且跟我的方案一样，要让吉姆恢复自由，此外，我们三个人说不定连性命都保不住。所以，我感到很满意，我还说这事不难，马到成功。我在这里用不着说明那是个什么方案，因为我知道它断断乎不会老是一成不变。我知道他会边进行，边修改。而且只要一有机会，他还会添上一些新花样。这就是他的一贯作风。

不过有一点是绝对肯定的，那就是说，汤姆·索亚确实是诚心诚意，真的打算帮我把那个黑人偷出来，好让他摆脱奴隶生活。可就是这一点，却让我百思而不解。他分明是一个很体面的孩子，从小受到良好教养，又有身份地位；他家里的人也都很有身份地位；何况他人很聪明，一点儿不是傻头傻脑；他还明辨是非，一点儿也不糊涂；他这个人不吝啬，心眼儿又挺好；可是现在，他也顾不上什么体面、是非和情分，居然有失自己的身份，参与这种勾当，在众人面前给他自个儿丢脸，还给家里人丢脸。个中道理叫我怎么也都悟不出来。这是惊人之举，好固然是好，但我认为还得赶紧跟他说清楚，也只有这样，才算是他的好朋友，让他悬崖勒马，保全自己的声誉。因此，我果真开口跟他说了，不料他马上叫我闭住嘴巴，他说：

“你还以为我不知道自己在干什么吗？难道我全都不知道自己在干什么吗？”

“是呀，你当然知道啦。”

“我不是明明说过打算帮你把那个黑人偷出来吗？”

“当然咯，你说过。”

“好，那就得了。”

他说的总共只有这些，我说的也不多。再说下去也不管用，因为他只要说过的事，就一定会做到，他历来都是这样的。可我总是闹不明白，这件事他怎么也愿卷进去。所以，我就只好不去管它了，而且再也不要多操心了。既然他定要这么干，我也无可奈何啦。

我们到家的时候，看见宅子里全都是黑糊糊的，寂静无声。我们就朝着贮液槽旁边的小屋走去，打算实地查看一下。我们穿过场院，想要看看那几条狗有什么反应。原来它们跟我们熟识了，所以并没有大声吠叫，只是像乡下的狗在夜间听见有人走过时通常都会吠上两声罢了。我们终于来到那个小屋，就对它的屋前和两侧都看了一下；后来，在我很不熟悉的那一面——北面——我们发现高处有一个方方正正的窗洞，窗框子上头只钉着一块厚木板。我说：

“这正是求之不得呀。这个窗洞不大不小，正够吉姆爬出来，只要我们把厚木板撬掉就得了。”

汤姆说：

“这也未免太简单[1]了——真像逃学一样容易。哈克·费恩，我倒是希望我们不妨踅摸到比你这个稍微复杂点儿的办法才好。”

“得了，”我说，“那就干脆采用上次我被害前用过的办法[2]，把厚木板锯掉，让吉姆出来，你觉得怎么样？”

“那倒是还有几份像，”他说，“说真的，那才有点儿神秘莫测，还得闯过重重难关，好，够刺激。不过，我敢说，我们还能踅摸到更好的办法，比这个再难上一倍呢。先别忙；我们上各处去看看再说。”

在这个小屋和栅栏之间，靠着住宅背后，有一间单坡屋顶的小披棚，跟小屋的屋檐连在一块儿。这个小披棚是用木板搭建的，长度跟小屋的相仿，可是宽度比较窄——大约只有六英尺左右；门开在南头，而且挂上了一把锁。汤姆走到煮肥皂的大壶跟前，经过到处搜索，找到了一根用来揭壶盖的铁管子。他就用它撬开了门上的一个肘钉，于是那根铁链条掉下来了。我们把门儿打开，钻了进去，再把门儿关上。我们划上了一根火柴，看到这个披棚是傍着小屋搭建的，但并不连在一起，也没铺上地板；里面没有别的东西，只是堆放着一些废旧生锈的锄头、铁锹和尖镐，此处还有一把老掉的破犁；那根火柴燃完了，我们也就钻了出来，使劲地把肘钉重新安上去，于是，那扇门看起来依然完好如故。汤姆简直是乐不可支。他说：

“这下子我们就有门儿了。我们就挖地三尺，让他钻出来吧。恐怕要花个把星期的工夫！”

我们就朝着住宅走过去，我是从后门进去的——这里都不锁门，你只要拉一下那根鹿皮拉闩绳，门就开了——可是，在汤姆·索亚看来，这还不够富于传奇色彩；他定要从靠墙的避雷针爬上去，才有一点儿惊险味道。殊不知先后三次，他每次无不是以爬到一半、滑下来失败告终，而且最后那一次，他还摔得差点儿没让脑浆流出来，这时候，他心里想只好打退堂鼓了。可是，他歇了一口气后，决定再试一回，碰碰运气，结果这一回却乐得他快要疯了。

转天一清早，天刚蒙蒙亮，我们就起了床，跑到那些黑人住的小木屋去，跟那几条狗逗着玩儿，还跟那个给吉姆送饭的黑人套交情——如果说他真的是给吉姆送饭的人的话。这些黑人刚用过早饭，准备下地干活去。看管吉姆的那个黑人，正拿着一只铁皮锅，把面包、肉食等等盛得满满的；正好别的黑人纷纷下地去的时候，屋里就有人把那钥匙给送过来了。

这个黑人长着一张和蔼可亲，但又傻里傻气的脸孔，他那卷曲的头发都用线扎成一绺一绺，据说可以驱魔避邪。他说，这几天夜里总有许多妖怪跟他纠缠不清，让他见到各种奇形怪状的东西，听见各种稀奇古怪的话音；他相信他这辈子还没让妖怪死缠过那么长的日子呢。他心里觉得紧张极了，他只好老是东躲西藏，竭力甩掉妖怪，所以，他连自己手头的事儿都给忘了。汤姆说：

“这些吃食是给谁的？是拿去喂狗吗？”

这个黑人脸上慢慢悠悠地漾着微笑，好像往泥水坑里扔过去一块砖片似的。

“是的，锡德少爷，是一条狗，而且还是一条怪得出奇的狗。你想看看它吗？”

“好吧。”

我用胳膊肘搡了汤姆一下，低声耳语地说：

“现在你一大早就去吗？那可不大符合我们原来的方案。”

“不，原来就不是嘛——可现在我们的方案就是这样。”

他呀真讨厌，我只好跟着他一块儿去，可是我心里老大不高兴。我们进去以后，差不多什么都看不见，因为里头是黑咕隆咚的。没料到吉姆果真待在里头，而且一看到了我们，就大声喊着说：

“哎哟哟，哈克！我的天哪！那不就是汤姆少爷吗？”

我早就知道会露馅儿，果然给我料到了。这时我简直茫然不知所措；不过就算知道的话，我也来不及了，因为这时候冷不防那个黑人插嘴说：

“怎么啦，我的老天哪！难道说他认得你们二位少爷吗？”

这时候我们才可以看清楚了。汤姆目不转睛地瞅着这个黑人，略带纳闷的口吻，说：

“你说谁认得我们呀？”

“怎么啦，我说的是眼前这个逃跑的黑人呀。”

“我估摸他不会认得我们。可是，你脑瓜里究竟凭什么才会有那么个想法呢？”

“凭什么才会有那么个想法？难道说刚才他没有大声喊过你们，好像他是认得你们吗？”

汤姆看来有点儿迷惑不解似的，说：

“哦，这真是怪得出奇呀。是谁大声喊来着呀？他在什么时候喊过的？他喊的是什么呀？”说罢，他掉过头来，泰然自若地跟我说：“刚才你可听见有人在喊吗？”

当然咯，我也没有别的话可说，所以我只好这样说：

“没有呀。我可没听见有人在说话。”

随后，他掉过头去，把吉姆浑身上下打量着，好像从没见过他似的，说：

“你大声喊过了吗？”

“不，少爷，我可没有喊过，”吉姆说，“少爷，我什么话也没说过。”

“一个字儿都没说过吗？”

“是啊，少爷，一个字儿我都没说过。”

“你从前见过我们吗？”

“不，没有见过，少爷；我可记不得啦。”

于是，汤姆又掉过身去，但见这个黑人露出诚惶诚恐的窘相，就有点儿正经八百地跟他说：

“你想一想，你这到底是怎么回事啦？你怎么会觉得有人在大声喊着？”

“哎呀，全都是那些该死的妖怪呀。说真的，少爷。我还不如咽气了才好。少爷，它们老跟我作对，它们差点儿没把我吓死。少爷，你可千万不要跟别人说，要不然赛拉斯老爷就会骂我的，因为他说过世界上压根儿就没有妖怪。我真巴不得这会儿他就在眼前——那看他还有什么好说的！我敢说，这一回呀他再也没得话说了。不过说来说去总是这样的：糊涂鬼一世都糊涂；他们什么事也不肯亲自去看个清楚；可是等你看清楚了，再告诉了他们，他们却硬是不相信。”

汤姆给了他一枚十美分硬币，说我们不会告诉别人，还叫他拿钱再添买些线来，多扎一些小辫儿。随后，他两眼直瞅着吉姆说：

“我可纳闷，真不知道赛拉斯姨父会不会打算绞死这个黑人。这么一个不知好歹、胆敢逃跑的黑人，要是被我逮住的话，我可饶不了他，干脆把他绞死就得了。”不过，等到那个黑人走到门口，仔细地看过那枚硬币，放进嘴里咬了一咬，看看它究竟是真是假，汤姆就低声耳语地跟吉姆说：

“你可千万别让人知道你认得我们。你在夜间如果听见有人在挖地，那就是我们啦。我们打算把你放出去。”

吉姆这才抓住我们的手，使劲地攥着，这时那个黑人又回来了。我们跟这个黑人说，如果说他欢迎我们来的话，我们肯定还会来；他说他很欢迎，特别是在天黑的时候，因为妖怪老爱在暗头里跟他捣蛋，因此，他真巴不得有人在夜里跟他做伴儿呢。

第三十五章


这时候差不多还得等上个把钟头才开早饭，所以我们就离开那里，跑到树林子里去，因为汤姆说过，我们一定要有点儿亮光照着，挖地才看得清楚，可是点着提灯又太招眼，说不定还会惹祸；因此，我们务必踅摸到那种叫作“狐火”的烂木块，那种烂木块在暗头里会隐隐约约地发出一点儿亮光来。那样的烂木块，我们总算踅摸到了，就藏在杂草堆里，随后坐下来歇歇脚。汤姆略带不满的口吻，说：

“真该死，这件事从头到底，看来是再容易、再笨拙也没有的了。所以，我说，想要制定一个棘手的方案，可真是难上加难。按说，此地应该有个守夜的人，可现在偏偏没有，也就谈不上先用毒药干掉他了。这里连一头可供我们下蒙汗药的狗也都没有。还有吉姆的一条腿，已被一根十英尺长的铁链条，跟他那张床的床腿锁在一起：反正你只要一抬起床架，把那根铁链条拉出来就得了。而且赛拉斯姨父觉得这儿人人都靠得住，他把钥匙送给那个黑人，压根儿也不另派专人监视他。本来吉姆早就可以从那个窗洞里钻出来，不过腿上拖着一根长十英尺的铁链条，走路可不太方便。这个可真讨厌，哈克。这个玩意儿简直是再蠢也没有了，我可从来没见过。现在，你一定要凭空设计出各种各样的难关来。唉，我们眼前条件也不够，要尽量利用现有的这些材料。但是不管怎么样，有一件事总得先交代清楚——那就是说，务必经过一连串艰难险阻的情节，最后把他搭救出来，这才能博得人们更多喝彩；本来那些艰难险阻的情节，应该预先给我们安排好的，可是现在既然没有安排好，我们也就只好自己开动脑筋，把它们通通构思出来。眼下，单说点提灯这件事吧。要是按照客观现实来说，我们只好假装点提灯是够危险的。其实，我们就算是明火执仗，我相信也未始不可。得了，说到这里，我忽然又想起来一件事，我们总得先要设法做一把锯才好。”

“我们要它来锯什么呀？”

“我们要它来锯什么？反正我们总得锯掉吉姆的床腿，把那根铁链条拉下来，可不是吗？”

“怎么啦，刚才你不是说过，不拘是谁，只要一抬起床架，把铁链条拉下来就得了吗？”

“嘿，哈克·费恩，亏你说得出这样的话。你的想法只够小娃娃的水平。难道说你什么书都没看过吗？——连特伦克男爵，卡萨诺瓦，本维努托·切利尼，和亨利四世[1]的书，还有别的什么英雄豪杰的书，也通通没有看过吗？有谁听说过，用这么小家败气的办法，放走一个囚犯的？不，那可要不得。大凡名流闻人常用的办法，是把床腿锯成两截，让它照样保持原状，好歹把锯屑咽下去，叫人什么都看不出来，再给锯开的地方抹上一些泥土和油脂，就算眼睛最尖的总管[2]，也看不出锯过的痕迹，还以为那床腿依然完好如故。到了那天晚上，反正万事俱备，你只要踹上一脚，床腿倒下来，把铁链条拉出来就得了。接下来，你只要把绳梯钩住城垛，顺着它爬下去，却在护城河里把腿摔断了——因为那挂绳梯太短，离地还差十九英尺，你知道——可是你抬头一看，只见你的骏马和你那些忠实的扈从都在那儿接你，他们赶紧把你打捞起来，拥上马鞍，于是，你就策马加鞭，直奔你那老家朗格多克[3]，或是纳瓦拉[4]，或是管它什么地方去了。那才叫潇洒呢，哈克。在那个小屋四周围，要是也有一条壕沟多好。在越狱的那天夜晚，我们要是时间来得及的话，不妨也挖它一条。”

我就说：

“我们要壕沟干什么呀？我们不是打算从小屋地底下把他拖出来吗？”

偏巧他压根儿没听见我的话。他把我这个人，连同别的一切，都已忘得一干二净了。他用手托着下巴颏儿，仔细地琢磨起来。过了半晌，他叹了一口气，摇摇头，稍后又叹了一口气，说：

“哦，那个可不行——而且也是大可不必啦。”

“什么事大可不必呀？”我说。

“哦，我原来想把吉姆的腿锯掉了。”他说。

“我的天哪！”我说，“是啊，是大可不必啦。那你想要锯掉他的腿，究竟为了什么呢？”

“啊，有些名流闻人就曾经那么干过。他们实在没法把铁链条去掉，出于万般无奈，只好把自己的手砍掉，随后逃跑。要是把一条腿锯掉，不是更帅吗？不过，这个问题我们姑且先撇下不说。反正目前还没有多大必要；再说吉姆是个黑人，怕也不懂得个中道理，不了解欧洲人的风俗习惯，所以我们还是不去谈它了。可是有一件事挺要紧——他手头非要有一挂绳梯不可。我们不妨把我们的被单扯碎成布条条，给他做一挂绳梯，一点儿也不费事。我们还可以做个大馅儿饼。把绳梯藏在里头，给他送去；从前人家都是这么做的。反正比这更难啃的馅儿饼我也都啃过。”

“嘿，汤姆·索亚，你这是什么话呀，”我说，“吉姆要绳梯干什么用？”

“他可要派大用场呢。你想想你这是什么话；这种事你还一点儿都不懂。一挂绳梯，对他来说非有不可；因为人家都有嘛。”

“你说说他要它到底干什么？”

“要它干什么？他不妨把它藏在床里头，可不是吗？人家都是那么做，所以他也得那么做。哈克，看来你倒是不打算照常规办事；你老是想出一套新花样。这挂绳梯就算是他用不着，不是照旧留在床里头，等他出逃以后，还好让人家拿它当作一点儿线索吗？难道你认为他们不需要线索吗？当然咯，他们需要。难道你不愿给他们留下一点儿吗？那不是让人感到太为难了，你说是不是？这样的事我可从没听说过。”

“好吧，”我说，“如果说规章上确有这么一条，说这挂绳梯他非有不可的话，那就替他做一挂吧，反正我也断断乎不愿违背规章办事。不过，汤姆·索亚，还有一个问题——我们果真把被单撕扯了，给吉姆编造绳梯，莎莉阿姨可一定会找我们麻烦，那也是用不着多说的。现在，依我看，用山核桃树皮做一挂绳梯，既不费一个铜子儿，也不算糟蹋什么东西，照样可以塞在馅儿饼里头，藏到干草垫褥底下，跟布条条编的绳梯完全一模一样。再说吉姆，他本来就是毫无经验，所以他也断断乎不会计较那是用什么玩意儿做的一挂——”

“别胡扯。哈克·费恩，我要是像你那样不懂事的话，早就缄口了——那是因为我有自知之明。有谁听说过一个政治犯是靠山核桃树皮编的绳梯，越狱逃跑的呀？这简直是滑稽透顶。”

“那好吧，汤姆，就照你的办吧。不过，你要是听我一言的话，你得让我从晾衣绳上去借一条被单来。”

他说那倒是未始不可。可是，那么一提问，又让他想出另一个点子来了。他说：

“还得借一件衬衫。”

“汤姆，我们要衬衫干什么呀？”

“让吉姆在那上头记日记。”

“记你什么奶奶的日记——吉姆压根儿连字儿都不会写。”

“就算他连字儿都不会写——他在衬衫上可以做些记号，不是吗，要是我们拿一把旧锡铅合金制成的调羹，或是一条箍桶的旧铁皮，给他做成一支笔的话？”

“怎么啦，汤姆，我们打从一只鹅身上拔一根羽毛，做一支笔，不是更好使，而且还省事得多吗？”

“地牢的四周围，哪有成群的鹅跑来跑去，让囚犯们随手拔根毛、做支笔，你这个小迷糊呀。通常囚犯做笔的材料，总是最粗、最硬、最费劲的东西，比方说，类似一盏破铜蜡烛台，或是别的随便拿得到的东西。而且他们做成一支笔，常常要耗去好几个星期，甚至好几个月的时间，因为他们只能靠在墙上磨呀磨的，老是磨个不停。就算是眼前有一支鹅毛笔，他们也断断乎不肯用。因为那是有违常规的。”

“好吧，那么我们用什么来给他做墨水呢？”

“有好多人是用铁锈伴眼泪当作墨水的，不过那都是仅仅限于平头百姓跟女流之辈罢了。大凡英雄好汉，无不蘸着自己的鲜血写字。吉姆不妨也可以试一试；如果说他打算传出去一点儿司空见惯的神秘消息，好让外人知道他押在什么地方，那么，他尽可以用吃饭的叉子，把消息写在洋铁皮盘子底下，再往窗外一扔就得了。那个‘铁面人’[5]就常常这样做的，那的确也是个好办法。”

“吉姆连洋铁皮盘子都没有呀。他们是用平底锅给他送饭的。”

“那可不要紧；我们倒是可以给他捎几个去。”

“那么，有谁认得出他在盘子上写的是什么呀？”

“那可是另一回事了，没关系，哈克·费恩。只要他写在盘子上头，扔到窗外来就可以了。你也不一定要认得出那些字儿的意思来。说老实话，一个囚犯在盘子底下，或是在别处所写的字儿，你八成儿都是认不得的。”

“既然认不得，那又干吗糟蹋那些盘子呢？”

“别管它，反正那都不是囚犯们自己的盘子呀。”

“可那些盘子总是有主儿的，不是吗？”

“嘿，就算是有，那又怎么样呢？囚犯还管它是谁的——”

他刚说到这儿，就突然顿住了，因为我们听见在吹号角，知道要开早饭了。所以，我们就赶紧回家转。

那天我花去了整整一上午的时间，才从晾衣绳上“借”来一条大被单和一件衬衫；我踅摸到一只旧口袋，就把它们塞在里头；我们又出去找到了许多“狐火”，也都装进口袋里。我管这等事叫作“借”，是按照老爸的惯常说法；岂料汤姆却说，这不是“借”，这是叫作“偷”。他说我们现在就是代表囚犯的，反正囚犯压根儿不管东西是怎么弄到手的，要拿就拿，别人也不会责怪他们。汤姆说，囚犯之所以偷东西，是因为没有它，就逃不了，那可不是犯罪，那是他们的权利。所以说，既然我们现在是代表囚犯的，那么，在这个地方只要对我们有一丁点儿用处的东西，我们完全有权利偷过来，有助于我们出狱逃跑。他还说，我们如果不是囚犯的话，这就另当别论了：一个人既没有锒铛入狱，而偏偏要去偷东西，那他准定是个十恶不赦的下流胚。所以，我们认为，把这里任何一件唾手可得的东西偷过来，都是未始不可。可是，从那以后，有一天我从黑人的瓜地里偷了一只西瓜，他却大惊小怪地跟我吵架。他就叫我拿十个美分去给那些黑人，却不给他们说明个中原因。汤姆说，他的本意是说，凡是我们需要的东西，都可以偷呗，得了，我就说，我正是需要那只西瓜。不料他却说也不见得非要那只西瓜才能越狱；其区别就在这儿。他说，要是我想在西瓜里头藏一把刀子，偷偷地把它送给吉姆，去刺死那个狱卒，那当然也是无可厚非。所以，我听了以后，也就不想再多啰唆了；可是话又说回来，每当我有机会随手可取一只大西瓜时，我只能端坐在那儿，穷琢磨那些类似鸡毛蒜皮的区别的话，那我真的看不懂代表囚犯究竟还有什么好处呢。

得了，我再接着刚才的话茬儿说下去。那天早上，我们一直等到家里的人都各自忙活去了，这时场院里连一个人影儿也没有了；汤姆方才能把那个口袋搬到单坡屋顶的小披棚里，我就伫立在远处给他望风。过了半晌，他出来了，我们就一块儿来到木料堆那里，坐下来攀谈。他说：

“现在万事齐备了，只缺工具。幸好那也不难解决。”

“工具？”我说。

“是的，不错。”

“工具用来干什么？”

“怎么啦，挖地皮用呗。我们可不能用嘴巴去啃地皮，让他逃出来吧？”

“那儿不是有好多老掉牙的尖镐什么的？用它们来挖地，救出那个黑人来，岂不是好得很吗？”我说。

他掉过头来，冲我露出一种怪怜悯我的神色，真让我差点儿没哭出来。他说：

“哈克·费恩，你听说过，有哪一个囚犯挂衣箱里，既有尖镐和铁锹，又有各种各样新式工具，让他用来挖地逃跑吗？现在我倒想问问你——如果说你好歹还懂点儿道理的话——光靠那个，他还能露一手，称什么英雄好汉来着？嘿，人家还不如干脆把钥匙借给你不就完了吗。尖镐和铁锹——人家断断乎也不肯给你的，哪怕你是个国王。”

“那好吧，”我说，“我们要是不用那些尖镐和铁锹，那要用什么呢？”

“有两把带鞘小刀就得了。”

“怎么啦，用带鞘小刀去挖那小屋的墙脚吗？”

“是的。”

“去你的，那可真傻了，汤姆。”

“傻不傻，没有关系，反正那才对路了——就叫作照常规办事。据我所知，此外再也没有别的办法了；凡是写到这一类事的书，我全都看过了。人家老是用小刀子来挖地的——而且挖的还不是软土，你要记住；通常总要凿通坚固的岩石。这可要耗去不知多少个星期，乃至于成年累月，没完没了地一直挖下去。哼，你看看马赛港湾迪弗城堡最末层地牢[6]里头的在押囚犯，他们里头有一个就是采取这种办法挖洞逃跑的。你猜，他总共挖了多长日子？”

“我可不知道。”

“你不妨猜猜看。”

“我可猜不着。一个半月吧？”

“三十七年——他是从中国钻出去的。那才真帅呢。我可巴不得这个堡垒的墙脚也是坚固的岩石才好。”

“吉姆在中国可一个人都不认得。”

“那又有什么关系？那个家伙[7]也是人地两疏呀。你可老爱扯到题外去，难道你就抓不住要点来谈吗？”

“好吧——我才不管他打从哪儿钻出来呢，反正只要他出得来就得了。我估摸吉姆也不会介意。不过有一件事，要知道——吉姆的岁数不算小了，用小刀子来挖地恐怕不行。说不定他支持不下去吧。”

“他还支持得住。你总不会认为挖通软土的墙脚，非得长达三十七年之久吧？”

“汤姆，那你就说说到底要多久？”

“哦，时间嘛固然要耗去不少。可我们断断乎不能拖得太长了，因为也许不会太久，赛拉斯姨父就会得到来自河下游新奥尔良的信息。他会知道吉姆并不是从那儿逃出来的。那时，他下一招准会在各报刊登招领启事什么的，让人家把吉姆领回去。所以，我们断断乎不能循规蹈矩，没完没了地一直挖下去。按说，我估摸我们应该耗费两年的时间，不过那可是要不得。由于眼前局面瞬息万变，我倒是觉得，我们要马上动手挖，越快越好。挖完以后，我们只要煞有介事地认为那是历时三十七年挖成的就得了。往后一听到风声不妙，我们立时把他拖了出来一块儿跑。得了，我估摸这才是上策。”

“哦，这么说还有点儿道理，”我说，“煞有介事嘛，既不费钱，煞有介事嘛，一点儿也不费事；反正只要有一个明确的目的，就是煞有介事地认为历时长达一百五十年之久，我也不介意的。说真的，等我亲手挖过以后，倒也不见得是很吃力的。所以，现在我就走了，得去踅摸那两把带鞘的小刀子。”

“踅摸三把来，”他说，“我们还要用一把来做锯呢。”

“汤姆，我真不知道我这样点拨，是不是不符合常规，而又亵渎神明，”我说，“那个烟熏室后面的屋檐板底下，不是分明插着一根长满锈斑的旧锯条吗？”

他露出有点儿既厌烦、又泄气的神色，说：

“哈克，本想教你懂一点儿事儿，结果还是白费劲儿。快去踅摸带鞘的小刀子吧——一共要三把。”我就只好照办了。

第三十六章


那天夜里，我们猜想大家都睡着了，这时候，我们顺着避雷针滑下去，钻进那个单坡屋顶的小披棚，关上了门，再把那些“狐火”倒了出来，就动手干了起来。我们把横在墙脚那根圆木的中段前面的东西都清除掉，辟出一块四五英尺见宽的场地。汤姆说，现在他恰好站在吉姆的床背后，我们就从这里往下挖，即使挖通了，小屋里头的人也都看不见那儿有个大窟窿，因为吉姆的床罩几乎垂到地上，你一定要把它揭起来，弯下腰去，方才看得见床底下的窟窿。于是，我们就拿着刀子挖呀挖的，挖个不停，差不离一直挖到深更半夜。这时候，我们浑身乏累得要命，双手长满了泡，可是效果几乎一点儿也没有。后来，我就说：

“汤姆·索亚，这岂止是三十七年的活儿，看来还得忙上三十八个年头呢。”

他一句话也没有说。不过，他叹了一口气，过了一会儿，他停下来不挖了，又过了一会儿，我知道他心里正在仔细思考着。过后他就说：

“这可一点儿不管用，哈克，这样挖下去也是白搭。如果说我们真的是囚犯的话，那倒也罢了，反正那时我们想挖多少年，就挖它个多少年，一点儿也用不着犯愁；每天趁着看守换岗的时候，我们挖它个几分钟，手上也不至于会起泡了，而且还可以时断时续地挖下去，一年接一年地挖，挖得又道地，又符合常规。可是话又说回来，我们断断乎不能这样磨磨蹭蹭下去，我们非得赶紧一点儿，我们还要争分夺秒才好呢。要是照这样再挖它个一夜，我们就得歇上一个星期，让手上的伤养养好——要不然，我们的两只手连这把小刀子都不敢碰了。”

“那么，我们该怎么办呢，汤姆？”

“你这就听我说吧。这当然是不对头的，还有点儿没德行，说实话，我很不乐意开口——不过，眼下也只有这么一条路：我们只好用尖镐把他挖出来，但要煞有介事地认为那是用刀子挖的。”

“啊，你这才算说对了！”我说，“你的头脑越来越清楚了，汤姆·索亚。不管什么德行不德行，反正挖地少不得用尖镐。至于我呢，我是压根儿不管德行那一套的。我要是去偷一个黑人，或是一只西瓜，或是一本主日学校的课本的话，只管把它捞到手，至于使的是什么手段，我全不经心在意。反正现在我要的是我的黑人，要的是那只西瓜，要的是那主日学校的课本。如果说尖镐是拿起来最方便的东西，那我就用它去挖那个黑人，去挖那只西瓜，去挖那个课本。至于那些内行老手觉得有什么想法，我才不管呢。”

“得了，”他说，“在类似这种场合，我们权且把尖镐煞有介事地当作刀子，也是无可厚非；要不然我既不赞同，也不会站在一旁，眼看着那些常规遭人破坏了——因为对就是对，错就是错，一个人既不糊涂，又能识得好坏，干吗还要去做错事？你尽管用尖镐把吉姆给挖出来，用不着煞有介事地把尖镐当作刀子，反正那是因为你不知道不对。可是我就不行，因为我知道这样不对。递给我一把小刀吧。”

他自己的那把小刀明明就在他身边，可我还是把我的这把小刀递给了他。他接住后往地上一扔，说：

“递给我一把带鞘的小刀子。”

这时，我简直茫然不知所措——可是稍后我仔细地想了一会儿。我就在那堆破旧工具里头翻寻了一下，顺手捡起一把丁字镐，递给了他；他一拿到手里，就开始干活，一句话也没说。

他老是那样过分挑剔，一点儿也不肯迁就。

于是，我也拿起一把铁锹来，我们两个就连挖带铲，还轮换着加紧干。我们不停歇地干了约莫半个钟头，再连着干下去，恐怕就顶不住了。反正我们挖过的地方看上去就像个大窟窿。稍后，我上了楼，往窗外望了一眼，只见汤姆正在攀缘避雷针，使劲地往上爬。他两手疼痛发炎，怎么也爬不上来。到后来，他说：

“简直不管用，这样爬可不行。依你看，我最好应该怎么着才好？你肯不肯替我出出点子？”

“那当然肯，”我说，“不过，依我看，那可违反常规。还是走楼梯上来，煞有介事地当作是从避雷针上来就得了。”

于是，他就照我的话儿做了。

转天，汤姆从屋里偷了一只锡铅合金调羹和一盏铜蜡烛台，打算给吉姆做些钢笔，另外还偷了六支蜡烛。我在黑人住的小屋附近来回转悠，想有凑巧机会，偷个三只洋铁皮盘子。汤姆说那还不够；可是我说，吉姆只要把盘子往窗外扔，不拘是谁也看不见，因为它们准定掉在窗洞底下那些毛叶泽兰和曼陀罗里头——那时，我们就可以把它们捡回来，让他下一次再用。于是汤姆就觉得满意了。随后他说：

“现在还得琢磨个办法：怎样把东西送给吉姆。”

“等我们把洞挖好了，”我说，“就从那个洞里送进去就得了。”

他立时露出瞧不起人的神色，还咕哝着说了一些话，仿佛是谁都没听见过这么一个傻点子。于是，他就继续仔细地推敲着。过了一会儿，他说他琢磨出来两三个办法，可是眼前还用不着选定究竟采用哪一个。他说我们首先还得告诉吉姆一声。

那天晚上，十点钟刚过，我们就顺着避雷针滑下去，带着一支蜡烛，蹲在窗洞底下听了一会儿，只听见吉姆还在鼾声大作。于是，我们就把蜡烛扔了进去，但也没有把吉姆惊醒。随后，我们又挥锹、又抡镐地去挖地道，忙了约莫两个半钟头，总算是大功告成了。我们爬了进去，从吉姆的床底下，爬到了小屋里，到处乱摸了一阵，好歹踅摸到那支蜡烛，就把它点着了。我们站在他床前，只见他身体健壮，精力充沛，就轻声轻气地、慢慢悠悠地把他叫醒了。他一见到我们，高兴得差点儿没哭起来。他管我们叫作小宝贝儿，以及他想出来的许许多多亲热的称谓。他要求我们马上去踅摸一把凿子，先把他腿上的铁链条凿断，然后赶紧逃跑，一刻儿也耽搁不得。不料汤姆却对他说那是多么不合常规。就坐下来把我们的方案全都告诉了吉姆，还说这些方案如遇到紧急情况，随时都会改变，叫他丝毫也不要害怕，因为我们十拿九稳准能让他逃出去。吉姆说那敢情好，我们就坐在那儿叙叙旧，过后汤姆还问了他好多问题。吉姆告诉他说，赛拉斯姨父每隔一两天就过来陪他做祷告，莎莉阿姨也不时过来，看看他舒服不舒服，吃食够不够，他们两位都待他和气极了。这时候，汤姆说：

“得了，我可知道有辙了。我们正好让他们俩给你捎些东西去。”

我说：“那种事你可千万别做；那种傻点子我可从没听说过。”可是我的话儿他压根儿不理睬，他还是照样说下去。他只要方案制订好了，做起来总是这种作风。

他告诉吉姆说，我们打算通过给吉姆送饭的那个黑人纳特，把藏着绳梯的大馅儿饼，连同一些别的比较大的东西，就像走私一样运给他，所以，他千万留心守候，不要大惊小怪，打开东西时也不要让纳特看见。他还说，我们想要把一些小不点儿的东西，放在赛拉斯姨父的外套口袋里，吉姆务必把它们一一偷出来才好。我们要是能凑准机会的话，还会把一些东西拴在阿姨的围裙衣带上，或是放在她的围裙口袋里头。他还告诉吉姆说，那些东西都是些什么玩意儿，又派什么用场的。汤姆还点拨他怎样蘸着自己的鲜血在衬衫上头写日记，以及诸如此类的事情。他样样事情都跟吉姆说清楚了。吉姆对这些玩意儿十之八九都闹不懂个中道理，可是他觉得我们是白人，毕竟要比他高明，所以，他也就满意了，还说他一定照汤姆所说的做去。

吉姆有好几只玉米穗烟斗和许多烟叶子，所以我们聚在一块儿唠唠嗑，真是痛快极了。随后，我们从那个洞里爬出去，回屋睡觉，我们的两只手惨不忍睹，好像被什么东西啃嚼过似的。这时，汤姆简直是兴高采烈。他说，这一回可算是他有生以来玩得最来劲儿，也是最富有智谋的一次。他说，只要他琢磨得出什么妙计来，我们就要在有生之年坚持下去，将来让我们的子子孙孙去把吉姆救出来，因为他相信：这套妙计吉姆越是习惯，就会越来越喜欢。他说，那么一来，就可以持续到八十年之久，从而创造监禁时间最长的惊人纪录。他还说，到了那时，我们参与此事的人，个个都能扬名四海。

我们一早来到了木料堆那儿，把那盏铜蜡烛台掰成长短适中的细铜条，汤姆把它们和一只锡铅合金调羹都装进自己口袋里。随后，我们跑到黑人住的一溜小屋那里，我就跟纳特闲扯，分散了他的注意力；汤姆趁此机会，把一根细铜条插在给吉姆送食物的盘子里的一个纯玉米面包中间。于是，我们就跟着纳特一块儿去看看效果怎样；果然不出所料，效果好得很：吉姆刚咬了一口面包，他满口牙齿差点儿都给崩掉了；从效果好这一点来说，什么玩意儿都比不上它更灵验的了。汤姆自己也是这么说的。可是吉姆他并没有露馅儿，只说是一颗石子什么的，你知道这种石子在面包里头是常有的事，不算稀奇。不过，从此以后，不管是什么吃食，他要是不先拿叉子在三四个地方戳一戳，就断断乎不敢再用牙齿咬了。

我们正在那半明半暗的光线里站着的时候，吉姆的床底下忽然蹿出来两条狗，随后一条跟一条，拢共蹿出来十一条，挤逼得连你透气的余地几乎都没有了。天哪，我们忘了闩上单坡屋顶的披棚的小门。这个黑人纳特只是大吼一声：“妖怪来了！”随即昏倒在地上，置身在那群狗的当间，开始哼哧哼哧地喘起气来，仿佛要一命呜呼似的。冷不防汤姆一脚踹开房门，随手抓起一块给吉姆吃的肉，往外面一扔，这些狗全都蹿了出去乱抢一气，眨眼间，他出去把门关好，转身又回来了，而且我知道他把另一个门也给关上了。随后，他就过来摆弄这个黑人，连宠带哄了他一会儿，问他是不是还疑神疑鬼，仿佛又见到了什么东西。他从地上站了起来，两眼往四下里眨巴着，说：

“锡德少爷，你会说我是个傻瓜，可是我分明亲眼看见了成千上万条恶狗，或是妖怪，或是别的什么东西。我要是说瞎话，就让我立刻死在这里好了。我敢说千真万确，我是看见过的，准错不了。锡德少爷，我还摸着过它们——我还摸着过它们，少爷；它们打从四面八方向我扑了过来。真该死的，但愿我有一回能逮住它们里头的一个多好啊——只要有一回逮住就好了——除此以外，我什么都不要。不过话又说回来，但愿它们还是别跟我作对就好了。”

汤姆说：

“好吧，我这就告诉你，我有怎么个想法。它们上这儿来，干吗偏要在这个逃跑的黑人吃早饭的时候呢？那是因为它们肚子饿了；原因就在这里，你赶快做个祭妖用的馅儿饼吧。现在你要做的就是这件事。”

“可是，我的天哪，锡德少爷，我怎么会做祭妖用的馅儿饼呀？我压根儿不知道该怎么做呢。我从来都没听说过。”

“那就只好我来替你做吧。”

“您乐意替我做吗，小乖乖？——您到底是乐意了吗？我可要跪在您脚前磕头了，我准磕！”

“得了，我就替你做一个吧，一是看在你的分上，二是你待我们挺不错，领我们来看看这个逃跑的黑人。不过你可千万谨小慎微。以后我们上这儿来的时候，你应该让脸儿侧过去，不管我们往平底锅里放什么东西，你都得假装一点儿也没瞧见。吉姆把平底锅里的东西倒出来的时候，你也不要去偷看——要不然出了什么事，我可就没办法啦。特别要注意的是：那些祭妖用的东西，你可千万别去触摸。”

“锡德少爷，我怎么还敢触摸？您这是算什么话呀？哪怕是给我十百千亿块钱，我也不敢用手指尖儿去碰它一下。”





第三十七章


那件事好歹安排停当了。所以，我们就转身离开，来到后院里的废物堆，那里堆满许多旧靴子、破衣服、破瓶子碎片、旧洋铁皮锅和类似这样的废物。我们东翻西寻，找到了一只旧洋铁皮洗衣盆，把盆底窟窿补好后，想要用它来烤制馅儿饼。我们把它端到地窨子里，偷来了满满的一盆面粉，就赶紧去吃早饭，顺便又踅摸到两颗钉墙面板的大钉子，汤姆说，囚犯拿了这种钉子在地牢墙壁上涂写他的大名和伤心事，倒也挺方便。随后他把其中的一颗放到莎莉阿姨搭在椅子上的围裙口袋里；另一颗我们插到赛拉斯姨父放在柜子上的呢帽子的帽圈里，因为我们听孩子们说，那天早上他们的爸爸妈妈都要到那个逃跑的黑人的小屋去。汤姆又在吃早饭前，把那只锡铅合金调羹放到赛拉斯姨父的外套口袋里，不过这时候，莎莉阿姨还没有到，我们也就只好略等片刻了。

一转眼她就到了，她简直又气又恼，满脸通红，连饭前祷告也都等不及了；她一只手提着壶儿让咖啡喷涌而出，另一只戴顶针的手往近旁的孩子头上猛地敲了一下，说：

“我一忽儿楼上，一忽儿又楼下，到处也踅摸不着，你的另一件衬衫，到底上哪儿去啦？”

我猛地吓得心直往下沉，跟我的肝肺什么的沉到一块儿了，这时有一块挺硬的玉米面包皮，也跟着它往我的嗓子眼里穿过去，可是半路上碰到一声干咳，当即一个反弹，正好击中了对过餐桌那个孩子的眼睛，使他马上歪头缩脖子，赛过鱼钩上的一条蚯蚓，并且还大哭大叫起来，仿佛打仗时大声呐喊似的。汤姆的脸上也有点儿沮丧的神色。当时那种尴尬场面，僵持了足足有一刻钟光景。要是有人随便哄抬一下，我差点儿没和盘托出呢。不过那一阵过去了以后，我们又都相安无事了——其实，刚才我们浑身打冷战，就是因为莎莉阿姨这一问来得太突然罢了。赛拉斯姨父说：

“这实在是怪得出奇，让我可真看不懂。我记得清清楚楚，自己是把它脱下来了，因为——”

“因为你总共就只穿着一件呗。你们不妨也听听这个人说的话！我知道你是把它脱下来了。反正我比你还糟糕的记性也知道得清楚得多呢，因为它昨天在绳子上晾着——我还亲眼看见过呢。可是现在，它连影儿也没了——这才是要害所在。你只好先换上那件红法兰绒的，等我有时间给你再做一件新的。要知道，那是我两年里头给你做的第三件衬衫了；为了你有衬衫穿，就得有人疲于奔命；至于那些衣服你是怎么穿的，我也就一点儿都不知道了。反正你活到这么一把年纪，按说也该学着点儿管管自己吧。”

“这我懂，莎莉，我何尝不愿意。不过，这件事不应该都怪我不好，因为你知道，只要衣服没有穿到我身上，我既看不见它，我也管不着它；而且，就算是脱下来了，我相信自己也从来没丢过一件呢。”

“哼，你从来也没丢过，就不能怪你不好，是不是，赛拉斯——依我看，你要是能丢的话，你会不丢那才怪呢。而且，你丢的岂止那一件衬衫。一只锡铅合金调羹连影儿也没了，那还不算完。本来总共有十只，现在只剩下九只了。我估摸，衬衫备不住给小牛犊[1]叼去了，不过，小牛犊断断乎不叼调羹，那可是千真万确的。”

“哎呀，还丢了别的什么东西来着，莎莉？”

“六支蜡烛也没了——就是这么点儿东西。蜡烛说不定是让耗子衔走了。我估摸准是那样。你老是说要堵耗子洞，可你只说不做；我暗自纳闷，它们总不能把整幢住宅都给偷走；耗子要是聪明点儿，准到你的头发里睡觉，赛拉斯——你永远也不会发觉。不过，丢了调羹，你可断断乎不能怪耗子了，这我可心里有数。”

“唉，莎莉，是我错了，我认错就得了：我向来粗心大意；明儿我一定抓紧点儿，把耗子洞都给堵上，反正不会再拖拉下去了。”

“哦，我可不着急，到明年再堵也不迟。马蒂尔达·安杰利娜·阿拉明塔·费尔普斯[2]!”

莎莉阿姨用顶针冲那孩子猛地一击，那孩子马上乖乖地把她那只小手从糖缸里缩回去了。这时候，有一个黑人女仆走到过道里，说：

“太太，一条被单不见啦。”

“一条被单不见啦！哎呀，我的天哪！”

“我今天就把耗子洞都给堵上！”赛拉斯姨父面有忧色地说。

“嘿，废话少说！——依你看，耗子还会把被单衔走了吗？莉莎，你说说被单上哪儿去了？”

“老天哪，我怎么会知道，莎莉太太？昨天还在绳子上晾着，今天就不见了，再也找不回来。”

“眼看着世界的末日就要来到啦。我活了大半辈子，这类事可真从来还没见过。一件衬衫，一条被单，一只调羹，六支蜡——”

“太太，太太，”一个年轻的，脸色蜡黄的女佣人赶过来说，“一只黄铜蜡烛台不见啦。”

“快滚开，你这个蠢娘儿们，要不然我就拿平底锅揍你。”

啊，她可真是气得怒火中烧。我举目四顾，正想伺机溜掉，到树林子里待一会儿，等她怒火消退了再说。她如此这般地狂怒下去，几乎要闹翻了天，吓得大家噤若寒蝉，一动也不敢动。后来，赛拉斯姨父脸上不免有点儿傻乎乎似的，却把那只调羹从他口袋里掏摸出来了。她立时息怒，张大嘴巴，举起双手直发愣；至于我呢，我真恨不得上天入地才好。幸亏没有多久也就过去了，因为她说：

“果然被我料到了。原来调羹一直就在你的口袋里。说不定别的什么东西，也全都在那儿呢。那它怎么会到你的口袋里去呢？”

“我真的一点儿都不知道，莎莉，”他略带歉意地说，“要不然你准知道我也会说出来的。早饭前，我正在专心学习《使徒行传》[3]第十七章；我估摸，那时候我一定走了神，把它放到口袋里去了，还自以为放进去的是我的那本《圣经》。准是这么回事儿，反正我的《圣经》并没有在口袋里。不过，等我过去一看，那本《圣经》只要还在原处，我就会知道我并没把它放进去，那足以说明当时我放下了那本《圣经》，拿起来这只调羹，就——”

“哎呀，我的天哪！难道让人家歇一歇也不成！通通滚出去，不管是大人小孩全都出去。先让我心里平静下来，谁也不准到我跟前来。”

就算她悄悄地自言自语，我也会听得清楚，刚才她如此大声吆喝更不用说了；哪怕是我已经咽了气，我也会马上站起来，听从她的话滚出去。我们正穿过小客厅的时候，那位老先生一拿起他的帽子，那颗钉墙面板的钉子就掉到地板上了。他只是把它捡了起来，放到壁炉架上，一言不语地走出去了。他刚才的一举一动，汤姆都看在眼里，而且还想起了那只调羹，就说：

“得了，再也别让他捎东西了，他这个人太靠不住。”稍后，他又说：“可是话又说回来，通过那只调羹，他好歹给我们做过好事了，尽管他本人并不知道。所以嘛，我们也得给他做一点儿好事，还不要让他知道——那就是说，干脆替他把耗子洞都给堵上吧。”

地窨子里耗子洞可真多着呢，耗去了我们整整一个钟头，可是我们把耗子洞都堵得严丝合缝，而又齐整好看。随后，我们突然听见有人下楼的声响，连忙吹灭烛光，躲藏起来。原来是那位老先生下地窨子来了。他一手擎着蜡烛，一手拿着一捆堵洞的物料，看来他是全然心不在焉的样子。他茫然不知所措地走过来，这儿瞧瞧，那儿看看，把所有耗子洞逐个儿都看过了。随后，他在那里站了约莫五分钟光景，一边剥掉蜡烛上的烛滴，一边在那儿胡思乱想。后来，他慢慢悠悠地掉过身去，懵然无知地朝着楼梯那边走去，说：

“嘿，我可真记不得我什么时候早就堵过了。现在我好叫她别再怪我了，更不用提什么耗子不耗子了。不过别费事啦——还是随它去吧。我想，跟她说不见得有什么好处。”

于是，他就咕哝着上楼去了，我和汤姆也跟着离开了。他老人家可真是个大好人，历来如此。

汤姆这时心里正在犯愁，因为短缺一只调羹，他简直不知道如何是好。可是他又说我们非有不可；所以他就仔细地想了一会儿。后来，他终于想出一个点子来了，就关照我该从何处下手。随后，我们走到盛放调羹的篮子跟前，等到莎莉阿姨走过来，汤姆把那些调羹只数点过了，放一旁，我就偷偷地捡了一只，掖在袖子里头了。汤姆说：

“莎莉阿姨，怎么总共还是九只调羹呀？”

她说：

“你快玩儿去吧，别再跟我添麻烦。我比你可还清楚呢，刚才我已亲手点过了。”

“反正我已经点过两遍了，阿姨，我点来点去，只有九只。”

她露出极不耐烦的神色，不过她当然还得重新点一遍——不拘是谁都会这样的。

“哎呀，我的天哪，可不是只有九只吗！”她说，“这到底是怎么回事——真该死，我还得重新点一遍。”

于是，我就把我袖子里头那只调羹又偷偷地放了回去。等她点完了，就说：

“真该死，这会儿又是十只了！”她一下子露出又气又恼的神色。可是汤姆却说：

“得了，阿姨，我可不信那是十只。”

“你这小笨蛋，刚才你没看见我点过了吗？”

“我知道，可是——”

“得了，我再给你点一遍。”

于是，我又偷掉一只，所以这一回的只数跟以前一样——还是只有九只。你瞧，她一下子可恼火了——她浑身上下瑟瑟发抖，快要发疯了。于是，她就点过了一遍，又点了一遍，翻来覆去地点得她昏头昏脑，有时竟把那只篮子也当成调羹一块儿点在里头，结果是有三回只数全对头了，另有三回只数却都点错了。她顺手抓起那只篮子，往屋里一扔，狠狠地朝那只猫砸去。她要我们通通出去，好让她心里平静下来，还说从此刻起一直到吃午饭之间，我们要是再到她跟前胡闹，她就要剥我们的皮了。所以，正当她在撵我们走的时候，我们先把那一只调羹搞到手，随后丢到她的围裙口袋里，结果吉姆在晌午以前就拿到了调羹和那钉墙面板的钉子了。我们对这件事都很满意，汤姆说哪怕是多花上一倍的力气也值得，因为他说现在她点两回准错一回，反正她至死也点不清楚了；而且，即使她点清楚了，她也不信。他还说，等到她点呀点的一连点上三天，点得昏头昏脑的时候，估摸她一定点不下去了，这时谁还敢请她再点一下的话，她真想宰了他才解恨呢。

那天晚上，我们就把那条被单送回到晾衣绳上，又从她的壁橱里偷出一条被单来。在这两天里，我们一忽儿送回去，一忽儿又偷出来，连她自个儿也闹不清楚究竟总共有多少条被单了，她只好说她压根儿也不计较了；她说她再也不让这件事困扰自己了；她说她断断乎不再去瞎点一通，即使要她的命也洗手不干了。

现在我们一切都很顺顺当当了，幸亏有耗子和牛犊给我们帮了大忙，再加上她点来点去，点得她昏头昏脑，结果呢，衬衫、被单、调羹和蜡烛，全都到了我们手里。至于蜡烛台一事，反正无关紧要，过不了多久也就没事了。

可是那个馅儿饼，倒是个棘手问题；它给我们带来不知多少麻烦。我们跑到老远的树林子里，样样都预备好，就烧烤起来；后来好歹把它烤成了，还算很满意。但这个活儿并不是一天就完成的。我们总共用掉满满三大盆面粉，我们浑身上下几乎都被旺火烫伤过了，眼睛也被烟火熏得差点儿瞎了；因为，你知道，我们只想烤成一大张馅儿饼皮壳，可是它怎么也支撑不住，老是塌下去。当然咯，我们最后想出个好办法——那就是把绳梯也放在馅儿饼里一块儿烤。于是转天夜里，我们跟吉姆一块儿动手，把被单撕成细长布条条，再搓在一起，天还没有亮，就搓成了一条大绳子，既牢固，又好看，即便用它去绞人也行。我们却煞有介事地认为耗去了九个月的时间才做成的。

第二天上午，我们带着这条绳子到树林子里去，可是它怎么也装不进馅儿饼里头去。原来这条绳子是一大块被单做成的，我们即使要做上四十个馅儿饼，也绰绰有余，还有好多剩下来的，好熬汤，灌香肠，或是另作别的什么用途。也许我们还能用它操办一桌酒席呢。

不过我们用不着那么做。我们只要做一个馅儿饼就够了，剩下的全都扔掉了。我们烤馅饼时，并没有用那个洋铁皮洗脸盆，生怕盆底的焊锡给熔化了。赛拉斯姨父有一只祖传的挺名贵的长柄黄铜取暖炉，平日里他常拿它出来献宝似的，当初那是跟征服者威廉一世乘坐“五月花”号[4]，或是一条别的什么古船从英国一起来到美国的。他把这只黄铜取暖炉连同好多其他贵重的古旧器皿，都藏在高高的阁楼里。这倒也不是说它们有什么了不起，其实它们本来也算不了什么，可你要知道，只不过因为它们是古董罢了。我们就偷偷地把它取出来，带到树林子里去。可惜开头烤的几个馅饼都不成功，因为我们毕竟一窍不通，不过最末的一个总算烤得不错。我们先是在取暖炉四周围铺上一层生面，放到炭火上烤一会儿，把布绳子装进去，顶上再敷上一层生面，盖上盖子，把余火未尽的炭块覆盖在上面，我们手里拿着长柄儿，站在五英尺开外，又凉快，又舒适。过了一刻钟，一个大馅儿饼就烤成了，看上去倒也让人感到满意。可是话又说回来，吃这个馅儿饼的人，务必随身带两桶牙签，因为那副绳梯要是不叫他差点儿给撑死，就算我是胡说八道好了，而且还管保让他肚子痛得要命。

我们把这个祭妖用的大馅儿饼装进吉姆的平底锅时，纳特并没有看到。我们还在锅底下叠上三只洋铁皮盘子，再把吃食覆盖在上面；所以，样样东西吉姆全都拿到了。后来，他趁小屋里没有旁人的时候，就把绳梯从馅儿饼里掏了出来，藏在他的干草垫褥里头；随后，他在一只洋铁皮盘子上画了一些记号，就把它从窗洞里扔出去了。

第三十八章


做那几支笔可真是苦不堪言的活儿，做那把锯子也是一样；吉姆觉得让他题字，简直要他的命了。所谓题字，就是说，囚犯总得在墙壁上刻写一些什么文字之类的东西。可是我们认为他不能不题字，汤姆还说非得那样不可：从来没听人说过，哪一个政治犯在越狱逃跑前不曾把他的题字和纹章[1]留下来。

“你看看那位简·格雷郡主[2],”他说，“你看看吉尔福德·达德利；你再看看老诺森伯兰[3]！得了，哈克，就算它是挺费劲儿——你又该怎么办？——难道说你还想把它通通免去了吗？反正吉姆非得有题字和纹章不可。人家个个都有嘛。”

吉姆说：

“得了，汤姆少爷，我哪来什么‘蚊帐不蚊帐’的；我总共只有你给的这件衬衫，反正你知道我还得在它上头记日记呢。”

“哦，你压根儿还不懂呢，吉姆。纹章是另一回事。”

“得了，”我说，“反正吉姆说的并没有错。他确实是没有纹章，所以他才说他没有纹章呀。”

“这事我当然知道咯，”汤姆说，“可是他从这儿出逃以前，务必踅摸到一个——因为他要出去也得正大光明，断断乎不能玷污了他的名声。”

于是，我和吉姆各自找着了一块砖头来磨笔，吉姆磨的是细铜条，我磨的是锡铅合金调羹，汤姆在那儿仔细琢磨着纹章的款式。过了一会儿，他说他琢磨出来的款式真的太多了，几乎不知道究竟该用哪一个才好，不过他觉得有一个款式挺合意，就决定采用了。他说：

“在这面用纹章装饰的盾上，我们要画一条右斜线，或是右底线，在横跨盾形中央的中线上，画一个紫红色的X形十字，再画上一条昂首蹲着的狗，表示控诉。狗的脚下是锁链图形，代表蓄奴制。要画上三条口向上的曲线式的山型符号，要绿色，再在淡青色的底子上画上三条口向下的曲线。在盾的中下位置上，画一条竖着的锯齿曲线。盾的上部是一个在逃的黑奴，黑色。他的肩头上扛一根木棍，木棍上挑着他的包袱。这个包袱要在盾的左半部分。再画上几道红色，表示支持者，那就是你和我。最末是铭词一句：‘Maggiore fretta, minore atto'，这是从一本书里摘下来的——意思是说：‘欲速则不达’。”

“哎呀，我的天哪，”我说，“那剩下的是什么意思呢？”

“我们可没有工夫为那个犯愁，”他说，“我们还得拼命地挖下去呢。”

“得了，不管怎么样，”我说，“只讲里头一点儿，好不好？‘中线’是个什么玩意儿？”

“中线嘛——中线就是——你用不着知道中线是什么。到时候我会点拨你该怎么做的。”

“算了吧，汤姆，”我说，“我估摸你就不妨给人家讲一讲吧。什么叫‘一根木棍’呀？”

“哦，可我也都不知道呀。不过这个他可非有不可。那些贵族个个都有嘛。”

他的脾性历来就是这样。他要是不高兴给你解释一个问题，你简直拿他没奈何。你哪怕是连接不断地追问他一个礼拜，也休想会有什么好结果。

他把绘制纹章一事安排停当了，现在他开始赶紧完成扫尾工作；那就是说，他要构思出一段让人伤心的题词——他说吉姆务必有一段，反正人家个个也都有嘛。他编了好几段，还大声念给我们听，就是下面这几段：





一、囚犯在这儿心碎了。

二、可怜的囚犯已被世人所唾弃，

　　在忧愁中过着悲惨的岁月。

三、三十七年凄凉的铁窗生涯，

　　让人心碎魂销，命归阴曹。

四、三十七年严酷的狱中囚禁，

　　早已家破人亡，无亲无友；

　　殊不知一命呜呼的贵客，

　　原来却是路易十四的亲儿子。





汤姆念这些题词时，声音一直在发颤，差点儿没哭出来。他念完以后，觉得以上这几段题词都很出色，简直拿不定主意，吉姆究竟该把哪一段刻到墙壁上去。后来，他觉得吉姆索性把它们通通都刻上去就得了。吉姆说让他用钉子在木板墙上刻那么一大堆废话，少说也得耗上一年工夫，何况他压根儿还不会写字呢。不过，汤姆说他不妨替他先打个草样，那他只要依样画葫芦就得了。过了一会儿，汤姆又说：

“你不妨想一想，哪有刻在木板上的呢，地牢里哪有木板墙？我们还得把那些题词刻到石头上去呀。我们快踅摸石头去吧。”

吉姆说石头比木头要更难对付；他说那么多字刻在石头上，耗去时间更长，恐怕他这一辈子都出不去了。可是汤姆说他会让我帮他一块儿干。随后，他看了一下我跟吉姆磨笔的进度如何。那可真是一件难、慢、烦、腻的活儿，尽管我两手疼痛发炎，也没法养伤，何况我们磨了那么久，好像一点儿进展都没有。于是，汤姆说：

“我可知道该怎么办啦。我们务必踅摸到一块大石头，好把那个纹章跟那些令人伤心的题词都给刻上去；我们也就可以一箭双雕了。锯木厂那边有一块大磨石，我们偷偷地给弄过来，再把那些题词都刻上去，另外还可以用它来磨笔、磨锯子呢。”

这个点子可真不赖，那块磨石也真不错；可是我们觉得最好马上就起来。这时还不到子夜，我们就赶到锯木厂去，把吉姆一人留下来干活儿。我们推着偷来的磨石，让它滚着回家去，但是没想到费劲儿极了。有时候，我们使尽了力气扶住它，结果它还是东歪西斜倒下来，而且每一回我们差点儿都挨砸了。汤姆说，我们还没有把它推到家里，恐怕我们俩里头有一个准被它砸死了。我们刚把它推到半路上，早就筋疲力尽，浑身大汗差点儿把我们给淹死了。我们一看没辙了，只好去找吉姆。于是，吉姆抬起床架，把铁链条拉出来，往脖子上绕了两圈，就跟着我们一块儿从洞里爬出来，回到了磨石跟前。吉姆跟我只是拨弄了一下那块磨石，一点儿也不费劲地推着它往前跑；汤姆则在旁边指挥着。他当起指挥来，把哪一个孩子都盖过去了。不管做什么事儿，反正他都是头头是道。

我们的那个洞，其实不算小，但要让这块大磨石滚进去还嫌不够大。可是吉姆抡起尖镐，挖了好几下，就把它挖得够大了。我们推着磨石进去以后，汤姆用钉子把那些题词的草样描在它上面，关照吉姆拿钉子权当凿子，又从单坡屋顶的小披棚废物堆里捡来一根铁闩，给他当作榔头，汤姆还叫他敲敲凿凿，一直敲凿下去，等到那半支蜡烛点完了，把磨石藏到干草垫褥底下，再睡在它上头。随后，我们帮他把铁链条重新拴在床腿上，这时我们自己也正打算回去睡觉，冷不防汤姆又想起一件事来了，他说：

“吉姆，你这儿有没有蜘蛛？”

“没有，少爷，谢天谢地还好没有，汤姆少爷。”

“那好吧，我们这就给你踅摸一些吧。”

“老天保佑你啦，小宝贝，我要那玩意儿干什么？我见了它们就害怕。宁可响尾蛇在我跟前转悠呢。”

汤姆心里琢磨了一会儿，就说：

“这个点子真好呀。我估摸大概前人也那么做过，必定那么做过，自然是有道理。是的，这可真是个好点子。你会把它养在哪儿呀？”

“养什么呀，汤姆少爷？”

“怎么啦，当然是养响尾蛇。”

“哎哟哟，老天哪，汤姆少爷！得了吧，一条响尾蛇要是钻到这儿来，我就会用我的头撞开圆木墙头冲出去。”

“嘿，吉姆，没有多久，你就不会害怕它了。反正你可以把它驯化了。”

“把它驯化了！”

“不错——容易得很。不管是什么飞禽走兽，你只要待它好，把它当作心肝儿宝贝，它就会感激你，它断断乎不会伤害一个把它当成心肝儿宝贝的人，它连那么个想法也都不会有。不论哪一本书上都是这么说的。你不妨试试看——别的要求我也不谈了；先试个两三天，好不好？嘿，没有多久，你跟它混熟了，它也就爱上你啦；它会跟你睡在一块儿，一刻儿都离不开你，还让你把它绕在你的脖子上，连它的头也会探到你的嘴巴里去。”

“我求求你啦，汤姆少爷——别这么说，好不好！我可受不了！它让我把它的头探到我的嘴巴里去——只为了得到我的欢心，是不是？我敢打赌，不管它等到哪年哪月，我断断乎也不请它探到我嘴巴里去。特别是，我可不要它跟我睡在一块儿。”

“吉姆，你可别犯傻。大凡囚犯身边，总得有某一种不会说话的小宠物。如果说前人没玩过响尾蛇的话，那你不妨就开个风气之先，试着玩它一下，不是比别的什么还都光彩吗？这么大的光彩，怕你万万也想不到吧。”

“得了吧，汤姆少爷，那样的光彩我可一点儿不想要。这蛇一口就咬掉了我吉姆的下巴颏儿，还谈什么光彩不光彩？！算了吧，先生，我可不想那么做。”

“真该死，你试试看都不成？我只想让你试试看——试过了，要是不灵的话，你就用不着再坚持下去呀。”

“如果说我只试了一下，就被这蛇咬了，那我岂不是白白地受罪了吗？汤姆少爷，凡是合情合理的事儿，我差不离都心甘情愿去做，可是，你跟哈克定要把一条响尾蛇弄到这儿来让我驯化的话，那我没奈何，只好开溜了，准定开溜了，反正我说到就做到。”

“得了，如果说你老是这么死不开窍，那就算了，随它去吧。我们不妨给你踅摸几条花蛇[4]来，你再拿几个铜纽扣，拴到它们的尾巴上，权当它们是响尾蛇，我估摸那总该没问题了吧。”

“这种蛇我倒受得了，汤姆少爷。不过，我老实跟你说吧，真该死，还是不要的好。我可从来都不知道，当囚犯居然有那么多的麻烦事。”

“是呀，因为要想做得地地道道，这总是在所难免。那么，你这儿耗子有没有？”

“没有，少爷，我连一只都没见过。”

“得了，我们就给你踅摸一些来吧。”

“嘿，汤姆少爷，我要耗子来干什么呀？真是该死的东西，它们彻夜通宵地围着你转，还啃你的脚丫子，吵闹得你连觉也睡不成。不，少爷，如果说非要不可的话，还不如给我几条菜花蛇，可是耗子千万别给我呀，它们对我一点儿也没有用处。”

“可是，吉姆，我老实告诉你，你呀非有不可——人家个个都有嘛。你就别再大惊小怪啦。囚犯身边从来就不会没有耗子的，这样的先例从来还没听人说过呢。人家会训练耗子，逗着它们玩儿，教它们耍把戏，它们也就像苍蝇似的老是围着你转悠。不过，你还得演奏音乐给它们听。那么，你有什么演奏乐器没有？”

“我什么也都没有，除了一把粗木梳跟一张纸，还有一只口拨琴[5]。不过，我估摸耗子大概瞧不起我的单簧口琴吧。”

“它们可不见得吧。它们才不管你演奏的是什么音乐呢。耗子听你玩弄口拨琴，已够美滋滋了。凡是飞禽走兽都喜欢听音乐——在大牢里，它们才更爱听呢。特别是恼人的乐曲；反正单簧口琴也吹不出什么别的曲调来，不过准能逗得它们都跑出来，看看你是不是有什么伤心事儿。结果你一点儿也没什么，过得还美不滋儿呢。依我看，每天晚上临睡前，或是转天一大早醒来，你可要坐在床头，拨弄拨弄单簧口琴。拨弄一支‘最末一缕情思已断’吧——这个乐曲一下子准能把耗子吸引过来，比别的什么都灵验。你只拨弄了两分钟左右，就会看见所有的耗子、蜘蛛、蛇虫、百脚等等，全都爬了过来，既替你犯愁，还会一窝蜂围住你，跟你在一块儿玩个痛快。”

“不错，我估摸，它们当然玩个痛快，汤姆少爷，但是我吉姆玩得结果怎么样呢？哎哟哟，恐怕只有天晓得。不过话又说回来，定要我那么做，我也就只好那么做呗。反正我会把那些飞禽走兽糊弄得都很服服帖帖，断断乎不让它们到这屋里乱闹腾。”

汤姆等了一会儿，仔细琢磨着，是不是还短缺别的什么东西。过了半晌，他就说：

“哦——有一件事我给忘了。你能不能在这儿养一株花，你看呢？”

“这个我可不知道，也许可以吧，汤姆少爷。可是这儿光线暗得很，不管是什么花儿，对我可一点儿也没用处，反正在这儿栽花，准定麻烦得很。”

“嘿，不管怎么样，你还得试试看。别的囚犯也都栽过花嘛。”

“在这儿栽上一株像大猫尾巴似的毛蕊花，我说，也许还能成活，汤姆少爷，不过说到底，也还是得不偿失。”

“你先别信那个。我们给你去踅摸一株小的，你把它栽在那边旮旯里，精心培养它。你不要叫它毛蕊花，你得管它叫作‘皮乔拉’[6]——这是它在大牢里最贴切的名字呢。而且你还要用你的眼泪去浇浇它。”

“怎么啦，我这儿有的是天然泉水，汤姆少爷。”

“你万万不好用天然泉水；你只好用你的眼泪去浇浇它。人家历来都是这么个浇法。”

“嘿，汤姆少爷，我敢说，别人刚开始用眼泪去浇他的毛蕊花，可我在这儿用天然泉水浇活的那株毛蕊花，早已枝条盘绕了。”

“哪儿的话！反正你还得用眼泪去浇它。”

“那它包管死在我手里，汤姆少爷，准是死定了的，因为我压根儿不会哭的。”

于是，汤姆一下子给难住了。不过，他仔细琢磨了一会儿，就撺掇吉姆只好多受些折磨，不妨用个洋葱头来抹抹眼睛。他答应转天一大早到黑人住的小屋里去替他踅摸一个，偷偷地搁在吉姆的咖啡壶里。吉姆说他还真巴不得“在咖啡壶里来上一点儿烟叶子呢”。随后，吉姆就自怨自艾地说，他会尽心尽力，不厌其烦地去栽培那株毛蕊花，既要拨弄单簧口琴给一大群耗子听，还要哄着蛇虫、蜘蛛等等吹吹拍拍的；除了这些以外，他没奈何只好磨磨笔，刻刻题词，记记日记，以及忙不完的别的什么活儿，他不觉感到当囚犯比做什么事都不易；困难很多，任务又重，还得动不动受气。因此，汤姆差点儿没跟他动肝火，说他是不识好歹，试问天底下哪一个囚犯会有那么多的大好机会，日后可以扬名四海，可他偏偏还不领情，差不多都要糟蹋在他手里了。所以，吉姆心里感到非常难过，说他往后再也不敢这么泄气了。随后，我跟汤姆就一块儿去睡觉了。

第三十九章


我们一大早去村里，买了一只捕鼠的铁丝笼，带回家里来，又把偌大的一个耗子洞重新挖开，不到个把钟头光景，就逮住了十五只硕鼠。随后，我们把捕鼠笼抬过去，藏在莎莉阿姨的床底下某个可靠的地方。不料我们出去踅摸蜘蛛的时候，那个名叫托马斯·富兰克林·本杰明·杰斐逊·亚历山大·费尔普斯的小伢儿，一看见床底下那只捕鼠笼，就过去把笼门打开，想看看那些耗子会不会跑出来。果然，它们一下子都蹿出来了。没多久莎莉阿姨就进来了。等我们回到房里的时候，她正站在床上大发雷霆，因为那些耗子竟敢肆无忌惮地拿她寻开心，解闷儿。所以，她顺手抄起山核桃木制的手杖，揍了我们俩一顿。后来，我们足足花费了两个钟头时间，才逮回来十五六只，唉，那个爱管闲事的小伢儿真讨厌。不过，这回逮住的样儿都不怎么样的，因为头一回逮到的是那群耗子里头最壮硕的。反正比头一回更棒的耗子，我可从来还没见过。

我们逮到了一大堆蜘蛛、蟑螂、蛤蟆、毛虫，还有好多别的什么昆虫，可真是洋洋大观；我们本想再踅摸一个马蜂窝，可是没有得手，因为它们正在窝里合家团圆呢。当时我们并没有就此死心，我们跟它们僵持了好长时间，因为我们打算看看，到底是我们呢，还是它们败下阵来，没想到结果却是我们败下阵来了。我们就踅摸到一点儿土木香[1]，在那些患处一抹，不觉几乎立时见好，但只是坐下来还有点儿不利索。于是，我们就去踅摸蛇虫，总共逮住了二十多条花蛇和家蛇，都被装进一只口袋里，扛到我们房间里。这时候已经开晚饭了；我们虽然已经忙活了整整一天了，但是特别痛快；觉得肚子饿吗？——嘿，我倒是一点儿也不饿！等我们回来一看，真该死，连一条蛇都没了——因为我们口袋扎得不够紧，所以，它们全都蹿出去，早已无踪无影了。但是这还算不要紧，反正它们依然盘踞在这幢住宅里；我们揣想好歹准能逮回一些来。果然不错，这里蛇虫可真不少，而且还出没无常。你会看到，从椽子上或是别的什么地方，时不时掉下几条来，八成儿落在你的盘子里，要不然就掉在你的脖子根上，多半是在你压根儿用不着它们的地方。其实嘛，它们倒是长得非常漂亮，都带着一条条花纹，哪怕是来了上百万条，也不见得会伤害人。可是在莎莉阿姨的眼里就大不一样了，不管是哪一种蛇虫，她都瞧不起，你简直拿她没奈何，她老是觉得受不了。每当一条蛇猝然间掉在她身上，那她什么也都顾不上，老是扔下手里的活儿，拔脚就往外跑。像她这样风风火火的女人家，我可从来还没见过呢。你还会听见她一个劲在喊救命，你硬是劝不动她用火钳把这蛇夹出去。她要是一翻身，看见一条蛇盘踞在床上，就会赶紧爬起来，扯着嗓子不停呼喊，好像家里着了火似的。这么一来，她就把那位老先生惊醒了，不料他老人家却说，他真巴不得上帝从来没把蛇虫造出来该有多好。反正到了所有的蛇虫从屋子里消失殆尽，已有一个多礼拜了，莎莉阿姨还是心有余悸；她依然是惶惶不可终日；每当她坐在那儿若有所思的时候，你只消用一支翎毛轻轻地碰一下她的脖子，就会吓得她魂灵儿出了窍。这真是怪得出奇了。可是汤姆却说，大凡裙钗之辈全都是这样。他也说不出个所以然来，反正她们天生就是这个德行。

每当有一条蛇掉在她身边，我们都得挨一顿打。她还说，我们要是把蛇再弄到家里来，她就毫不客气，要用比挨打还厉害的办法治我们。其实，挨打——我并不在乎，那简直算不了什么；可我就是最怕去逮蛇，那确实是麻烦透顶。但我们还是去逮了好多蛇，连同别的什么东西，全都带到吉姆的小屋里，所以，每当它们一窝蜂似的拥过来，听吉姆他演奏乐曲的时候，你可从没见过吉姆小屋里头该有多么热闹了。吉姆压根儿不喜欢蜘蛛，蜘蛛同样也不喜欢吉姆；它们老是暗中伺机捣乱，给他颜色看。吉姆说，他床上有了那些耗子、蛇虫，还有那块大磨石，简直连个栖身之地都没有，即使难得腾出一小块来，你也没法儿安睡，因为这里确实是太热闹了，而且一天到晚，总是那么热闹。他说，因为通常它们不在同一个时刻睡觉，而是轮流上岗值班；每当蛇虫睡着了，耗子就马上登场，等到耗子下班歇息去了，蛇虫又出来上岗放哨，所以说，他身子底下少不了有一帮子活货，妨碍他下榻睡觉；而在他头顶上，老有另一帮子活货演马戏给他看，他要是另觅一个新地方，那些蜘蛛就在他走过的时候冷不防给他个措手不及。他说，这一回他果真逃得出去的话，往后哪怕是给他发薪水，他再也不打算当什么囚犯不囚犯了。

三个星期一晃就过去了，一切都很顺顺当当。那件衬衫早就夹在馅儿饼里送进去了，所以，吉姆每次被耗子咬上一口，就霍地跳起来，趁那“红墨水”还顶新鲜亮艳的时候，赶紧往日记上写上一点儿。至于说那些笔，早已磨好了，题词等等，也都刻在大磨石上了。那条床腿已被锯成两截，我们连锯屑也都给吃了，肚子立时痛得可真要命。我们原以为全都要一命呜呼了，偏偏结果并没有死。那是我从没见过的最难消化的一种锯屑；汤姆也是这么说的。不过，正如刚才我所说的，我们现在总算把所有事情都给做完了；这时我们早已疲乏不堪，特别是吉姆。那位老先生给新奥尔良以南那个种植园写过了两封信，叫他们来人把他们这个在逃的黑奴领回去，无奈一直没有接到回信，因为那里压根儿就没有这么一个种植园。所以，他说他打算在圣路易斯和新奥尔良各家报纸上，刊登招领吉姆的启事。他一提到圣路易斯的报纸，我马上浑身打冷战，我知道，我们一分一秒也耽误不得了。于是汤姆说，现在该是写匿名信的时候了。

“匿名信是个什么玩意儿呀？”我说。

“那就是快要出事前给人的警告。这种警告的方式不是一成不变的，有时候这么做，有时候那么做。不过总是有人四处探听，向坐镇城堡的长官通风报信。当年路易十六想要从杜伊勒里宫[2]出逃时，就是他的一个女仆报的信。这种办法非常妙，匿名信也很不赖，所以，这两种方法我们全都采用。照例是让囚犯的老娘换上儿子的衣服，留在大牢里，儿子穿上他老娘的衣裙偷偷地逃跑了。我们也不妨照样试试看。”

“可是，你且听我说，汤姆，我们干吗一定要警告他们快要出事了？让他们自个儿去发现——那本来就是他们自个儿的事呀。”

“不错，我全都知道；可你总不能全指靠着他们。他们一开头就那么个样子——什么都不管，样样事情要我们办。他们老是依赖别人，傻里傻气的，什么事情也不会注意到。所以说，我们要是事前不给他们打个招呼，那就压根儿没有什么人或是什么事来干预我们，结果呢，我们历尽千辛万苦地大干了一场，到头来这次越狱准定是太平淡无奇了，压根儿算不了什么——反正跟越狱一点儿也不相称。”

“那好啊，对我来说，汤姆，这正是我想要的呢。”

“胡扯。”他脸上顿时露出憎恶的神色说。于是，我就说：

“我可一点儿怨气都没有呀。反正你觉得怎么好就得了。你就说说那个女仆该怎么着吧。”

“你就去当那个女仆吧。深更半夜你就溜进去，把那个脸儿蜡黄的女仆的衣裙偷出来。”

“哎哟哟，汤姆，那转天一大早准出乱子，因为女仆她十之八九只有那么一套衣裙。”

“我也知道。可是你穿上它才不过一刻钟，拿着那封匿名信，从前门底下塞进去就得了。”

“好吧，我照办就得了。不过，我穿着我自个儿这身打扮去送信，岂不是更方便吗？”

“那时你看起来就不像一个女仆了，是不是？”

“不错。但是，反正没有人看见我像不像一个女仆呀。”

“那就不管它了。最要紧的是，我们是在履行义务，管它是不是有人看见我们。你怎么连一点儿规矩都不懂呢？”

“好了，我没有话好说了。那个女仆我当就我当吧。请问谁来当吉姆的母亲呀？”

“由我来当吉姆的母亲。我上莎莉阿姨那儿去偷一套长裙子就得了。”

“那好吧，等我跟吉姆走了以后，你可得待在那个小屋里了。”

“怕也不会待多久。我会给吉姆的衣服里塞满了草料，把它放在他的床上，权充他的那个女扮男装的母亲。随后，吉姆把那个黑人老太太的衣裙从我身上脱下来，再穿到他身上去，这时我们两个就一块儿出逃。好一个潇洒的囚犯逃跑了，这就叫作出逃。比方说，一个国王逃跑了，通常就用这种说法。国王的儿子逃跑也是一样，至于说他是个私生子，还是个公生子，那全都没有关系。”

于是，汤姆就写了那封匿名信；当天晚上，我把那个脸色蜡黄的女仆的衣裙偷了过来，穿在自己身上，就照着汤姆给我的点拨，把信从前门底下塞了进去。那匿名信上是这么写着：





千万小心！祸在眼前，留神防备。

第二天夜里，我们还把汤姆用血画着骷髅底下两根交叉的股骨的一幅画，贴在前门上。第三天夜里，又在后门贴了一幅画，上面画着一口棺材。这一家人看了以后，竟被吓得那样狼狈相，我可从来还没见过呢。他们简直害怕得要死，好像他们这幢住宅里被死鬼挤得水泄不通似的，在每一件东西后头和床底下，都有一些死鬼埋伏着，令人不寒而栗，乃至于在空中还飘浮着一些死鬼。一扇门只要砰的一声关上了，莎莉阿姨就应声蹦了起来，大声喊道：“哎哟哟，我的天啊！”要是有一个什么东西掉在地上了，她也会马上蹦了起来，大声喊道：“哎哟哟，我的天哪！”要是你无意之中碰了她一下，她也会照样又蹦又喊一回。她不管上哪儿去，老是忧心忡忡，因为她觉得时时刻刻都有什么东西尾随着她——所以，她动不动猛地转过身来，大声喊道：“哎哟哟，我的天哪！”可她刚转了三分之二时，却又猛地转身回去，又照样大喊一声。她害怕上床去睡觉，但又不敢坐着等天亮。所以，汤姆就说，这个点子确实是呱呱叫；他说，他还从来没见过让他如此开心的事儿。他说，由此可见这件事做得很对头。

接着，他说现在就要看压台戏[3]了！因此，转天凌晨，天刚蒙蒙亮的时候，我们已写好了另一封信，只是暗自纳闷，真不知道该怎么把它送出去，因为头天吃晚饭时，我们听他们说过，他们打算派黑人彻夜通宵看守着前门后门。汤姆顺着避雷针滑下去，往四处刺探了一下虚实，只见后门值夜的那个黑人正在酣然睡大觉，他就把那封信插在他的脖子后头，一转身跑回来了。那封信上是这么写着：





千万别辜负我的一番好意，我真巴不得跟你们交个朋友。现在有一帮子强盗，从印第安人保留地[4]来到这里，打算在今天夜里把你们那个在逃的黑人劫走。他们会千方百计地吓唬你们，使你们不敢出来招惹他们。我就是那一帮子人里头的一个，可是我虔信上帝，我真巴不得弃恶从善，重新老老实实地过日子，所以我愿向外泄露这种险恶的阴谋。他们将在午夜时分，从北边沿围栅偷偷地过来，带着一把假钥匙，直奔那个黑人的小屋，把他劫走。他们叫我在外头把风，只要一看见有什么危险，就赶快吹起洋铁皮号角来。但我就是不愿意这样做，我想等他们一进屋，像羊那样发咩声，而压根儿不吹号角，那时候，趁他们去掉那铁链条之际，你们就可以悄悄地溜过去，把他们反锁在屋里，以后逐个儿杀掉他们也不迟。你们务必照我的话办事，要不然他们起了疑心，准要大喊大闹。我并不希望得到任何报酬，只想知道我已尽到自己的本分就得了。

第四十章


早饭过后，我们心情非常好，就带着一顿午饭，坐上我的小划子，去河对岸钓鱼，玩得真够痛快的。我们看了一下那排木筏，发觉它还是好端端地在那里。我们很晚才回来吃晚饭，那时候，看到他们显得万分着急，烦躁，简直是晕头晕脑，真不知道如何是好。我们的晚饭刚扒拉完，他们就打发我们马上去睡觉，既不告诉我们出了什么事儿，也只字不提第二封匿名信；其实，他们也犯不着再提了，反正我们比谁都要清楚啦。我们上楼去，刚走到半中间，莎莉阿姨才转过身去，这时我们就悄悄地溜到地窨子，从小柜里满满当当装了一顿午饭的吃食，带着它回到房里，方才上床歇觉。不料，到了大约十一点半光景，我们却又起床了；这时候，汤姆身上穿着他偷来的莎莉阿姨的那套衣裙，正打算带着午饭往外走，但是他又说：

“黄油在哪儿呢？”

“我掰了一大块，”我说，“搁在一只纯玉米面包上了。”

“那你准是留那儿了——这儿可没有呀。”

“我们没有黄油也能凑合过去。”我说。

“我们有了黄油也没有什么不好，”他说，“你快去地窨子，把它取来。随后顺着避雷针滑下去，快点儿来呀。我这就去把草禾填在吉姆的衣服里头，假冒他的母亲；等你一到，我就像羊那样发咩声，随后一块儿逃跑。”

说罢，他抽身就走了；我也来到了地窨子。那块黄油约莫有个拳头大小，还在我原来搁着的地方，我就拿着那个纯玉米面包和黄油，吹灭了蜡烛，悄悄地上了楼，好不容易来到了地窨子顶上那一个楼层，冷不防莎莉阿姨点着蜡烛迎面走过来了。我赶紧把手里的东西塞进帽子里，再把帽子扣到脑瓜上，眨眼间她就看见我了。她说：

“你去过地窨子了吗？”

“是的，去过啦，阿姨。”

“你去那儿干什么呀？”

“没干什么。”

“没干什么？”

“没干什么，阿姨。”

“那准是什么鬼魂深更半夜把你拐到底下去的。”

“我可不知道，阿姨。”

“你可不知道？你可不要这样回答我，汤姆。我可要知道你在底下到底在干什么呀？”

“我什么事也没干，莎莉阿姨。天哪，我可真的什么事也没干。”

我心里估摸现在她会放我走的；要是在往常的话，她是会放的。不过我继而一想，恐怕近来出现的怪事太多了，不管是什么区区小事，只要稍微差了一点儿，她就急得要死。所以，她就斩钉截铁地说：

“你赶快到客厅去，在那儿待着，一会儿我就来。你在那儿准定干了跟你毫不相干的事，我可要把它了解清楚，反正我怎么也饶不了你。”

她抽身就走了，这时我就把门推开，走到客厅里去。我的天哪，客厅里头哪来这么一大群人呀！有十五个庄稼人，他们每人手里都有一支枪。我差点儿没给吓死了，就偷偷摸摸地走过去，坐在一把椅子里。他们那些人都散坐在客厅里，有些人偶尔交谈一两句话，可是话音压得非常低。他们个个都露出非常紧张不安的神色，只是故作镇静罢了。我一看就知道他们心里七上八下的，因为他们动不动把帽子摘下来又戴上去，一忽儿搔搔头皮，一忽儿互换座位，而且老是摸弄着他们身上的纽扣。我自个儿心里也是忐忑不安，只不过还好，我始终没把自己的帽子摘下来。

我恨不得莎莉阿姨快点儿回来处置我，她哪怕是想要狠揍我一顿也好；只要她让我走，我就会告诉汤姆，说这件事我们已经做得过头了。是我们自己捅了马蜂窝啦，所以，我们要马上打住，再也不能乱来一气，而且要带着吉姆尽快开溜，免得这一拨废物恼火了，再来追我们。

后来她终于回来了。她开始问了我好多问题，可我却一时还答不上来，那时我简直觉得头昏目眩，天旋地转似的，因为现在他们这些人，个个都心急火燎一般，有些人想要马上打埋伏去，捉拿那一拨亡命之徒，还说眼下只差几分钟就到深更半夜了；另一些人则竭力劝他们且慢出动，等到一听见咩声的暗号也不迟；而眼前阿姨依然在紧追不舍地盘问我，吓得我屁滚尿流，差点儿没昏倒在地上了；那个客厅里头又是越来越暖和，那块黄油也开始融化了，就顺着我的脖子根和耳朵后头流下来。过了半晌，他们里头有一个人说：“我是赞成马上出动，先在那个小屋里等着，他们过来一个就逮一个。”话音刚落，我差点儿没摔倒在地上了；可是，一股黄油却顺着我的额角流下来；莎莉阿姨一眼就看到了，她的脸儿顿时变得像白纸似的，她说：

“哎呀，我的天哪！这个孩子究竟是怎么啦？——他肯定得了脑炎，连脑浆子都流出来了！”

于是，大家全都赶过来看，她一抬手把我的帽子揭去，那个纯玉米面包和还剩下的黄油却全都露出来了。她一把抓住了我，搂到她的怀里，说：

“哎哟哟，你可真的把我吓坏了！得了，我真高兴，谢天谢地，原来你没有病，你知道，我们老是不走运。我怕只怕是祸不单行哩。我一看见那玩意儿，心里估摸你大概是没得命了，反正我认得出那种颜色和形状，它跟你的脑浆子一模一样，如果说你真的——哎呀，我的天哪，你干吗不告诉我你到那底下是去取这些东西呀？难道说我还会舍不得吗？赶快睡觉去，天亮以后再来见我！”

我一忽儿就上楼了，一忽儿又顺着避雷针滑下来，摸黑直奔那单坡屋顶的小披棚。我心急如焚，简直连话儿都说不出来了；可我还是赶紧告诉汤姆，我们只好撒腿就跑，一分钟也耽误不得——那边满屋子都是拿着枪的人！

他两眼闪闪发亮，说：

“不见得吧！——是真的吗？可真是呱呱叫！嘿，哈克，如果说再来一回的话，我敢打赌说，准能吸引过来两百人。要是我们能推迟到——”

“快点儿！快点儿呀！”我说，“吉姆在哪儿呀？”

“就在你的胳膊肘那儿。你一伸手就摸得着他。他全都打扮好了，万事俱备了。现在我们就溜出去，发咩声当作暗号吧。”

这时，我们听见那些人走到门前的脚步声。又听见他们摸弄挂在门上的那把锁；还有一个人说：

“我不是告诉过你，我们来得太早了；他们还没到——门还锁着呢。喂，我把你们几个人反锁在屋里，在暗头里先埋伏好，等他们一到，就把他们通通给打死。余下来的人就四处散开，只管留神听着，你们是不是听得见他们走过来。”

于是，他们就一哄而进，可他们在暗头里却看不见我们。我们忙着往床底下钻的时候，他们几乎就在我们身上踩了过去。不过，我们总算还是从床底下钻了过去，轻快利索地从那个洞里爬出来——吉姆打头阵，我紧紧地跟进，汤姆则殿后，这是按照汤姆的命令安排的。现在我们来到单坡屋顶的小披棚里，只听见外头很近的地方也有脚步声。我们匍匐爬行到门边，汤姆叫我们停住，他自己用两眼贴着门缝儿往外张望，可是外头一片漆黑，什么都看不见。他低声耳语地说，他想一听到脚步声走远了，就用胳膊肘搡我们一下，那时吉姆该是头一个溜出去，他本人则在后面压阵。于是，他让自己的耳朵贴在门缝上，一遍又一遍地听着，偏偏那些脚步声始终在外头回荡着。后来，他不知怎的用胳膊肘搡了我们一下，我们就弯着腰，溜了出去，这时既不敢喘口气，也不敢碰出一点儿响声来。我们有如一路纵队似的，朝着围栅偷偷地溜了过去。反正还算顺当，我们来到了围栅跟前，我和吉姆都跨越过去了。不料汤姆的裤子，却被围栅顶上的碎木片紧紧地咬住了，这时候他听见脚步声已经逼近，他只好使劲儿一挣扎，把那碎木片扯断，有了一点儿响声；待他赶上我们一块儿往前跑的时候，就有人大声嚷嚷说：

“那是谁呀？快回话，要不然我开枪啦！”

可我们并没有回话；我们只好飞也似的拼命往前跑。只听得后面有人正在猛冲上来，还有“砰、砰、砰”一阵枪响，子弹就从我们四周围呼啸而去！我们听得见他们在大声嚷着说：

“他们已来过这儿啦！他们直奔河边而去！快，追上去，伙计们！把狗缰绳松开，通通放出去！”

于是，他们就全速猛追上来了。我们听得见他们，因为他们都是脚蹬皮靴，而且还在大声呐喊；可是我们既没有穿皮靴，也不大声呐喊，我们正走在通往锯木厂的那条小路上；待他们追上来快要逼近我们的时候，我们就往路边灌木丛里一闪，让他们通通冲过去了，才又跟在他们后头跑。原来他们把所有的狗都给关起来了，深恐它们把强盗吓跑了，可是到了此时此刻，有人却把狗通通放出来了，它们就猛地冲了过去，汪汪汪地乱吠不休，好像真有上百万条似的；不过，说到底，它们毕竟都是我们家里的狗；所以，我们索性驻足不前，等它们冲过来好了；果然，它们一看我们原来不是陌生人，不值得大惊小怪的，只是给我们打了个招呼，又朝着前方一片呐喊和喧哗声奋力冲过去了；这时，我们又振作起精神来，飞也似的跟在它们后头，等我们快到锯木厂时，就穿过灌木丛，来到拴靠我的小划子的地方；我们纵身一跃，登上了小划子，死劲地划向河心，可还是照旧尽量不发出响声来。随后，我们就从容自在地朝着我的木筏停泊地——那座小岛划过去；反正我们还听得见河岸上那一片人狗之间相互吼叫的嘈杂声，一直到我们划得很远了，那些嘈杂声才越来越模糊不清，乃至于一点儿也听不见了。后来，我们一踏上木筏，我就说：

“老吉姆呀，现在你又恢复自由啦。我敢说往后你再也不会当奴隶了。”

“而且，这真是一件特大好事呀，哈克。策划得漂亮，而且干得也漂亮；反正这么一个让人扑朔迷离的锦囊妙计，不管是谁都琢磨不出来。”

我们心里都高兴得不得了，可是最高兴的还得数汤姆了，因为他小腿肚上挨了一颗子弹。

我跟吉姆一听说这件事，心里就不像刚才那么狂热了。他的创伤很厉害，而且还在流血。所以，我们让他躺在窝棚里，扯掉了公爵的一件衬衫给他包扎腿伤，不料他说：

“给我布条条，我自己包扎好了。现在歇手不得，再也不能在这儿鬼混下去了；这回出逃可真漂亮呀；操起长桨来，快点儿解开木筏缆绳！伙计们，我们干得端的是让人叫绝！确实是让人叫绝啦。我真巴不得还是挟着路易十六出逃该有多好，那么一来，他的传记里就不会写着‘圣路易之子，升天吧’[1]那句话；断断乎不会写的，伙计，我们管保哄着他越过国界——我们对他准定做得到——而且还能一眨眼就做到。操起长桨来吧——操起长桨来吧！”

可是我跟吉姆却在商量——又在琢磨着。我们琢磨过以后，我说：

“吉姆，你就说说吧。”

于是，他就说了：

“哦，依我看，是这样的，哈克。如果说放出来的那个人正是他，我们里头有一个伙计却挨了枪的话，那他会不会说：‘快来救救我吧，别去请大夫救这个伙计’呀？难道汤姆少爷就是那号人吗？他会说出那种话来吗？你放心好了，他断断乎不会的！那么，得了，我吉姆就会说出那种话来吗？不，断断乎不会的，少爷——只要大夫没有到，我断断乎寸步也不离开这儿；哪怕是守上四十年，我也绝不会离开！”

我知道他心地纯良；我估摸他会说出这样的话来——现在事情就好办了，我跟汤姆说，我这就去请医生来。为了这件事，他大吵大闹了一通，可是我跟吉姆仍然坚持自己的意见，一点儿不肯退让；于是，他就打算从窝棚里爬出来，亲自解开木筏的缆绳；可我们还是不让他动一动。跟着，他又把我们教训了一顿——但到头来还是白搭。

他看见我把小划子都已拾掇好了，他就说：

“好吧，你要是非去不可的话，那我就关照你，到了村镇该怎么办。先要把门儿关上，紧紧地蒙住那个医生的眼睛，叫他指着上天起誓，至死也要守口如瓶，再把装满金币的钱包放在他手里，摸着黑带领他在穷街陋巷乱转悠一阵子以后，才让他坐着小划子上这儿来，还得在那些小岛中间迂回曲折地兜圈子，同时也要搜搜身，他身上如有粉笔就要没收，等他回到村镇后再交还，要不然他会在这木筏上头画记号，将来他准可以再找到它。他们历来都会来这一套的。”

我说我一定误不了，就扭身走了；吉姆打算一见医生走过来，就躲到树林子里去，直到他回去为止。

第四十一章


那位医生已是上了年纪的人；我把他叫了起来的时候，才知道他还是一个非常和蔼可亲的老先生。我告诉他说，昨天下午我跟我弟弟到对面那个西班牙岛上去打猎，我们踅摸到一截木筏，就在那上面露宿。到了午夜时分，想必是他在梦中把枪踹了一脚，枪就走了火，正好击中了他的小腿肚，我们请他上那边去出诊，但是要求他只字不提这件事，也不要给旁人知道，因为我们打算今天晚上回家，让全家人都大吃一惊。

“你们是谁家的？”医生问。

“是费尔普斯家的，就在那边。”

“哦。”他说，过了半晌，他又说：“刚才你说他是怎么个挨了一枪？”

“他做了个梦，”我说，“在梦里挨了一枪。”

“好一个怪梦啊。”他说。

说罢，他点燃提灯，拿起挂包，我们就一块儿动身了。可他一见到那只小划子，就有点儿不屑一顾似的——他说，这只小划子刚够搭载一个人，坐上两个人恐怕够悬乎。我就说：

“嘿，你用不着害怕呀，先生，坐上我们三个还够轻快的呢。”

“是哪三个呀？”

“瞧，我跟锡德，还有——还有——还有我们的那些枪；我要说的就是这些。”

“哦。”他说。

可是他把脚踩在舷边上，使劲儿让小划子不停地晃动，接着就摇摇头说，依他看，还得踅摸一只稍微大些的船才好。无奈那些船只都被铁链条锁上了。于是，他就坐上我的小划子，叫我等着他回来，或者到附近去另觅一只，或者我不妨最好先回家去，让他们准备大吃一惊，如果说我乐意那么做的话。可是我说自己不打算那么做。所以我告诉他该怎样去找那座木筏，他就动身了。

过不了多久，我忽然想出一个点子来了。我暗自思忖，如果说他不能马上就治好腿伤呢？如果说他需要三四天的时间呢？那我们打算怎么办？——难道说就直挺挺地老躺在那儿，等着他把我们的秘密泄露出去吗？不，先生，我可自有妙计对付。反正我在这儿等着，等他一回来的时候，万一他说他还得再去一趟的话，那我也跟他一块儿去，哪怕是我浮水过去；到时候，我们就把他捆起来，看管好，顺着大河漂流下去，直到他把汤姆的腿伤治好了，我们给他按劳支付酬金，或是我们干脆倾其所有通通送给他，随后放他回岸上去。

于是，我就爬到一个木料堆里去，睡了一会儿；待我一醒过来的时候，太阳快到我的头顶上了！我飞也似的冲出去，直奔那个医生家，不料他家里的人说，他约莫在半夜里出诊去了，到现在还没回来呢，哎呀，我暗自寻思，看来汤姆的伤势很重，我马上就得赶回那个小岛上去。于是，我撒腿就跑，拐弯时差点儿没让脑袋撞到赛拉斯姨父的肚子上。他说：

“怎么啦，汤姆！这一阵你都上哪儿去了，你这捣蛋鬼？”

“我哪儿都没去呀，”我说，“只不过是去踅摸那个在逃的黑人——我跟锡德俩。”

“哦，你们到底上哪儿去踅摸呀？”他说，“你的阿姨都快急死了。”

“她可用不着急死呢，”我说，“因为我们个个都没事。我们老是跟在那些人和狗的后面跑，可是他们跑得特快，就把我们远远甩在后头了；不过我们觉得好像听见他们跑到河上去了，所以我们找了一只小划子，跟在他们后头赶，还划到河对过去看看，不料他们连影儿也没有了；于是，我们只好往上划过去，简直累得要命，后来把小划子一拴好就睡着了，个把钟头以前刚醒过来；我们又划到这边来，想探听一下消息。锡德上邮局去听听信息，我就分头上这儿来，给我们俩踅摸一点儿吃食，随后我们俩一块儿回家去。”

于是，我们就一块儿去邮局找锡德；可是果然被我料到了，他并没来过这儿。这位老先生从邮局里取出了一封信，我们又等候了一会儿，可锡德还是没有来；于是，这位老先生说我们一块儿走吧，等到锡德累得了不想再到处乱转以后，不管他乐意走着回家也好，还是坐小划子也好，反正随他高兴就得了——不过，我们可得乘坐马车。我没法说服他让我待在这儿等锡德；他说再等下去也不管用，而且我还务必尽早赶回去，让莎莉阿姨知道我们全都平安无事。

我们到家以后，莎莉阿姨一见到我，就高兴得又笑又哭，先是把我紧紧地搂抱了一下，接着又揍了我一顿，其实，她的那种揍只不过是聊胜于无罢了；她还说，等锡德回来，也照样让他领教一番。

现在这个客厅里头，已是人满为患；那些庄稼人都带着他们的老婆在这儿吃午饭；再加上一片七嘴八舌的嘈杂声，真是谁都没见过呢。那位霍奇基斯老太太可得比谁都啰唆了；她一直不停地在摇唇鼓舌，说：

“哎呀，费尔普斯大姐，我上那边小屋里仔细搜索过了，我敢说那个黑人准是疯啦。我就跟戴雷尔大姐说过——我究竟说过了没有，戴雷尔大姐？——我说，他准是疯啦，我说——我就是这么说的，是原话，一个字儿都不错。你们全都听着：他准是疯啦，我说；反正你只要了一下就知道啦，我说。只要看一看那大磨石就得了，我说；一个人要是神经没搭错，哪会在大磨石上凿刻那么一大堆疯话，我说；还说什么：这儿某某人的心已碎啦；这儿有个姓甚名谁的人，幽禁苦熬了三十七个年头啦；——又说到一个叫路易什么的亲儿子啦，以及如此这般说了一大堆浑话，他准是不折不扣地疯了，我说；我一开头就是这么说，说到中间我也是这么说，说到最后我始终是这么说——那个黑人准是疯啦——疯得就像尼波苦伲哉[1]，我说。”

“那倒也是，霍奇基斯大姐，你再看看那挂破布条条做的绳梯吧，”戴雷尔老太太说“，老天哪，你说说他要那个玩意儿，到底干吗呀——”

“你说的这些话，跟我刚才对厄特巴克大姐所说的一点儿也不差，不信你问问她就得了。她说，你们看看那挂破布条条做的绳梯吧，她说；于是，我就说了，是啊，你们全都看看吧，我说——他要它到底是干吗呀？我说。她就说了，霍奇基斯大姐啊，她说——”

“可是话又说回来，那块大磨石他们究竟是怎么个弄进去的呢？那个洞又是谁挖的？又是谁——”

“这些正好是我要说的话呀，彭罗德大哥！刚才我对——把那小碟子递给我，好不好？——我刚才对邓拉普大姐说，那块大磨石他们究竟是怎么弄到那儿去的，我说。而且居然还没有帮手，请你听清楚——没有帮手！这就怪了。别少见多怪，我说；帮手总是少不了的，我说；而且帮手一定还不少呢，我说；给那个黑人当帮手的，少说也有十几个，我真恨不得把这里黑人身上的皮都给剥下来，我定要弄清楚那些事都是谁干的，我说；而且，我还说——”

“你说至少也有十几个！——那些事说不定四十个人也干不了。看看那把小刀子做的锯子，还有一些零零碎碎的，做起来该有多么腻烦呀；再看看那条床腿竟然被锯断了，这个活儿即使让六个人干也得要个把礼拜呀；再看看床上头那个草禾做的假黑人；再看看——”

“你说的话句句都实在，海托华大哥！正如刚才我跟费尔普斯大哥他本人所说的话。他说，霍奇基斯大姐，你对这件事怎么个想法呀？我说，对什么事怎么个想法呀，费尔普斯大哥？他说，不妨想一想，那条腿就那样给锯断了，你心里又是怎么个想法呀？我敢说，断断乎不是床腿自个儿锯断的呗，我说——反正有人把它锯断的，我说。那就是我的看法，信不信由你，我可不在乎，我说。尽管事实如此，那始终是我的看法，我说。谁要是提得出更好的说法来，那就让他提去好了，反正我的话全说完了，我说。我还跟邓拉普大姐说——”

“呸，真该死的，那个小屋里准是天天晚上都挤满了黑人，而且那么多的活儿要连续四个礼拜才干得完呀，费尔普斯大姐。再看看那件衬衫吧——上面全是密密麻麻蘸着血写的非洲字，怪得很，谁看得懂呀！依我看，想必有一大帮子人，几乎夜以继日地没命似的写上去的。嘿，那玩意儿谁给我念出来，我就赏他两块金币。那些乱涂乱写的黑人，只要被我逮住了，我准得用鞭子抽他们，直抽得他们——”

“当然咯，有人帮着他，费普尔斯大哥！嘿，前些日子你要是在这幢住宅待过，我估摸你就会有那么个想法。反正他们什么都偷，只要摸着什么就偷什么——而且，你得听着，我们时时刻刻还在留神看着哪。那件衬衫他们就是从晾衣绳上偷去的！再说那条被单吧——就是他们拿去做绳梯的那条被单——也许谁都说不清他们总共偷过多少回啦，此外还有面粉、蜡烛、烛台、调羹，再加上那只老古董取暖炉，以及上千种别的什么玩意儿，反正现在我也都记不清啦；哦，还有我新做的印花布套裙；而且，赛拉斯跟我，还有我的锡德、汤姆，都是日日夜夜，两只眼睛一直在盯着看哪，就像刚才我跟你所说的那样。结果呢，我们连他们的一根毫毛都没揪着，一个影儿也没看见，一点儿响声也没听见。到头来你们不妨看看，他们悄悄地一下子溜到我们的鼻子尖底下来，糊弄了我们，反正被他们糊弄的，不但有我们，居然还有印第安人保留地的一帮子强盗。他们果真把那个黑人平安无事地给劫走了，临走时还有一十六条大汉、二十二条猛犬，跟在他们屁股后头穷追呀！我老实跟你说吧，这种事我压根儿还没听说过。哎呀，这种事就算让鬼神干，也未必会干得更出色、更漂亮。可我又估摸他们准定是鬼神呀——因为，我们家的狗，你们可都知道，哪儿还有比它们更能耐的呢？可是说来也真怪，那些狗连他们的足迹都没找着，连一回也没找着！个中奥秘，你们有谁能给我说说清楚——不管你们里头哪一位！”

“哎呀，这可真的盖过了——”

“天知道，我这辈子还没——”

“上天作证，我原本还不——”

“准是掘壁洞的贼骨头，还有——”

“我的老天哪，我可不敢住在这么个——”

“你不敢住！——唉，里奇韦大姐，我早已吓得魂不附体似的，几乎连平日里起床、睡觉、躺下，或是坐下来，都会不寒而栗。说不定他们还会偷——哎呀，我的天哪，你猜猜看，昨天刚到午夜时分，我简直是吓得魂灵儿出了窍。我要是不担心他们把我家里的人也给偷走几个，那才怪呢，我害怕得够呛，那时我的脑子差不多快要错乱了。现在大白天，我说这种话，看来真够傻乎乎的；不过，当时我心里想，我的那两个可怜的孩子，正睡在楼上那个冷冷清清的房间里，说老实话，我心里真是七上八下的，我就悄悄地爬上楼去，把他们都锁在里头了！我果真是那么做的。不拘是谁，我想，也都会那么做的。反正你知道，当你已被吓成那个样子的时候，心里越来越难受，而且老是越来越害怕，那时你脑子里自然就乱糟糟的，什么荒唐事你都做得出来；又过了一会儿，你暗自琢磨，如果说我是个孩子，睡在楼上尽头的那个房间里，连房门都没锁，那你——”她说到这儿顿住了，看来有点儿纳闷似的，随后慢慢悠悠地掉过头来，当她两眼看见我的时候——我立时站起来，往外溜达去了。

我暗自琢磨，如果说我到了外面某一处，把这件事稍微思考一会儿，也许我还可以更好地解释一下，为什么今天早晨我们没有在房间里。后来，我果真就这么做了。不过我还是不敢走得太远，要不然她会派人去找我的。到下午很晚的时候，那些人全都走尽了，我就回到家里，告诉她，正是那一片喧哗和枪响声把我和锡德给吵醒了，无奈房门已被反锁了，我们硬是要出去看热闹，所以我们顺着避雷针滑下去，结果我们俩都受了一点儿轻伤。反正往后我们断断乎不敢再那么做了。随后，我把我跟赛拉斯姨父所说的那些话，又对她重新说了一遍。她说她会饶了我们，她又说也许这还算是不幸中的大幸哩；她还说，谁都没承想孩子们会那么做，因为，依她看，孩子们全是一帮子愣头青，所以只要没出什么差错，她倒是觉得要多花点儿时间来感谢上帝，要知道我们毕竟还都好好地活着，并没有被她扔掉不管，自然用不着为过去的事犯愁了。于是，她就亲了亲我，又在我的头上拍拍，稍后好像是又陷入沉思之中。可是不一会儿，她却霍地蹦了起来，说：

“哎呀，哎呀，天都快黑下来了，锡德怎么还没回来呀！这孩子怎么啦！”

我一见机会到了，立时蹦了起来，说：

“我马上跑到镇上去，把他给找回来。”我说。

“不，你可去不得，”她说，“你就老老实实待在这儿吧。走丢了一个，已让人够受的了。他要是不回来吃晚饭，你姨父自然会去找他。”

嘿，他果然没回来吃晚饭，所以，晚饭过后姨父就出去了。

姨父约莫十点钟才回来的，仿佛有点儿不放心，因为他没有探听到汤姆的下落。莎莉阿姨着实是不放心，不过，赛拉斯姨父却说她干吗那么着急呢——他说，孩子总归是孩子嘛，明天一早他自然会平安无事地回来的。于是，她也就感到了不少宽慰。不过她说，她反正还得熬夜，等着他，而且要点上蜡烛，好让他远远地就看得见。

等我上楼睡觉的时候，她也陪我一块儿上楼，她拿着蜡烛，还替我盖好被子，像亲妈妈似的照顾我，使我感到怪不好意思，连她的脸我都不敢看了。她坐在床沿，跟我聊了好半天，她说锡德是个多么出色的孩子；看来她絮絮叨叨地总是谈不完他似的。她时不时盘问我，我会不会觉得他是走失了，或是受伤了，要不然也许是淹死了，说不定此时此刻他正躺在某个地方受苦呢，还是早已咽了气，可她却没法在他身边照料他，于是她的眼泪水就悄悄地滴落下来了。我就告诉她，锡德一点儿也没出事，明儿一早准定回家。她就马上使劲握握我的手，要不亲亲我的脸，叫我把那句话再说一遍，而且还要一直不断地说下去，因为她心里着实太痛苦了，那句话让她听了高兴高兴。临走时，她还目不转睛地、无限温柔地俯看着我的眼睛，说：

“汤姆，今后不打算锁房门了，反正有窗子，有避雷针呢；你总是会乖乖的，可不是？你不见得会走吧？就看在我的分上呀。”

天知道，我是多么心急火燎，要去看汤姆，我心里一直是魂牵梦萦地想去啊。可是听了她的那些话以后，我就不想去了，说什么我也不想去了。

不管她也好，还是汤姆也好，无时不在我的心心念念之中，所以，这一夜我老是辗转反侧睡不着。午夜时分，我有两回贴着避雷针滑下去，悄悄地兜到前头去，只见她坐在靠窗烛光里，两眼噙满泪水，凝望着那条大路。我真恨不得好生安慰安慰她，可又无可奈何，我只好指天起誓，往后再也不胡闹了，别让她伤心落泪了。我第三回醒过来，天刚刚亮，我滑下去又看了一看，她依然端坐在那儿，那支蜡烛差不多快点完了，她那白发苍苍的头正叩在自己手上，大概她已经睡着了。

第四十二章


那位老先生早饭前又到镇上去了，结果还是没探听到汤姆的下落。他们两位坐在餐桌旁，陷入沉思，一言不语，露出很悲哀的神色。他们的咖啡凉了，可什么也吃不下去。过了一会儿，老先生说：

“那封信我交给你了吗？”

“是什么信呀？”

“昨天我从邮局取出来的那封信。”

“没有呀，你从来没给过我什么信。”

“哦，想必是我又给忘了。”

于是，他在各个口袋里乱摸了一通，随后离开餐桌，走到他原先放那封信的地方，就取过来交给她看。她说：

“嘿，这是从圣彼得堡来的——这准是姐姐写的信。”

这时候我要是再出去溜达，也许会对我有好处，无奈我已是寸步难移了。没承想她刚要把信拆开，突然又把它扔掉，夺门而出——因为她看见外头来人了。我也看见了。原来是汤姆·索亚被人给抬着回来了；还有那位老医生，还有吉姆，穿着她的印花细布套裙，两手反绑在背后；另外还有好多人。我在近处随便找了一件东西，把那封信给藏起来，就赶紧往外冲。她朝着汤姆扑了过去，又哭又嚷：

“哎呀，他死了，他死了，我知道他是死了！”

汤姆把头稍微偏过来一些，嘴里咕哝着些什么，这说明他神志已经昏迷了；这时，莎莉阿姨猛地举起双手，说：

“他还活着呀，谢天谢地！这就好了！”她赶紧亲了他一下，就急匆匆往屋里跑，去给他拾掇床铺，又向左右两旁那些黑人跟其他家人——作了吩咐，边跑边说，话说得快极了，赛过在放连珠炮似的。

我跟着大伙儿走过去，想看看他们怎么个处置吉姆。老医生和赛拉斯姨父都跟着汤姆进屋了。那些人都暴怒了，有几个人要绞死吉姆，给这儿附近的黑人做个样板，让他们别再打算像吉姆那样逃跑，惹来了这么多麻烦，叫全家人日日夜夜吓得要死。可是另外有些人却说，莫要那么做，那可是不行的，因为他毕竟不是属于我们的黑人，他原来的主人定会找上门来，准要我们按黑人代价赔出钱来。这一下子把他们那股狂热劲儿稍微平息下去了，因为那些人虽然一见某个黑人事情做得不对头了，就恨不得把他绞死，但在拿那个黑人解恨之后，最最舍不得赔出钱来的，也还总是那些人。

虽然他们还是一个劲儿咒骂吉姆，动不动照着他的脑袋掴一两个巴掌，可是吉姆始终一言不发，也从不露出认得我的样子来。于是，他们把他押到原来那个小屋里，让他穿上自己的衣服，用铁链条又把他锁住，这回可不是锁在床腿上，而是锁在墙脚那根大圆木头上一颗大U形钉上，另外再给他戴上脚镣手铐；他们还说从此以后，除了面包和白水，什么都不给他吃，直到他的主人来了，或是他的主人过了期限不来，就只好干脆把他拍卖掉了。随后，他们把我们那个洞给堵了起来，说每天夜里务必派两个庄稼人在小屋附近持枪把守，大白天也得在小屋门口拴上一条看门狗。他们已把这件事处理完了，临别时总要骂骂咧咧，这才逐渐散去了。这时候，那位医生走过来，看了一眼，说：

“你们千万不能对他粗暴过了头，因为他这个黑人毕竟还不算坏。我找到了那个孩子的时候，一看就知道，要是没人帮忙，那颗子弹准定取不出来；而且当时情况也不允许我离开孩子去踅摸帮手。何况孩子的伤势越来越严重，过了好长时间，他就神志恍惚了，再也不让我走近他身旁；他又说，我要是用粉笔在他的木筏上涂记号，他就要宰了我，还说了许多类似这样的胡言乱语。我一看就知道拿他没奈何；于是，我就脱口而出说，我不管怎么总得踅摸个帮手呗；殊不知话音刚落，这个黑人就不知道从什么地方爬出来了，他说他愿意帮忙，他果真帮了忙，而且还帮得非常好。当然咯，我估摸他准是个在逃的黑奴，这可真让我为难，我不得不一直盯在那儿，盯了大半天，再加上一整夜。我老实告诉你们，当时我真是窘极了！我有两位病人正在发高烧，当然我要赶回镇上去看看他们，可我又不敢去，生怕这个黑人万一跑掉，人家准要怪我的不是了；可是河里又没有一只小船靠岸很近，听得见我的呼喊声。因此，我只好盯在那儿，一直盯到了今天大清早。可我从没见过像他那样忠心耿耿地侍候病人的黑人，而且，他又是不顾自己被人逮住的危险来照顾病人的，何况那时候他也早已疲乏不堪了，我看得很清楚，近来他被逼着干过不少重活。因此，我很喜欢这个黑人。我老实告诉你们，诸位先生，像这样的黑人值一千块金币——而且还万万不得怠慢他。反正我要他做什么事情，他全都做好了，那个孩子也像待在家里一样好——说不定还要更好些呢，因为那儿实在是太清静了。但是我可得守着他们两个，真是没辙，寸步不离地盯在那里，一直盯到今天大清早；后来，有好几个人坐着小船过来了，说来也凑巧，这个黑人正坐在地铺旁边，脑袋磕在膝盖上睡着了。我悄悄地向那些人不断地比划着，他们偷偷地冲他扑了过来，趁他还莫名其妙的时候，早就把他逮住、捆绑起来了。我们简直可以说一点儿也没费劲呢。那孩子当时还在迷迷糊糊地睡觉，我们给所有的桨裹上东西，不让它发响，再把木筏拴在小船后头，悄悄地把它拽到河对过去。这个黑人自始至终，从来没吵闹过，一直默不作声。诸位先生，这个黑人可真不坏；我对他就是这么个看法。”

有人说：

“不错，大夫，你说的话很有道理。”

于是，别的人态度也都有点儿缓和下来了。我心里非常感激这位老医生，因为他对吉姆做的好事，真是功德无量；我还感到高兴的，是我对他老总算没看错，因为我头一眼看见他，就觉得他心眼儿好，是个好人。随后，他们全都承认吉姆的行为表现极好，对他应该另眼相看，还要发给他酬赏。于是，他们每个人马上都真心实意地保证，往后再也不骂他了。

随后，他们就出来了，又把他锁在小屋里。我巴不得他们会说，吉姆身上的铁链条不妨去掉一两根，因为这些铁链条实在是太沉重了；我还巴不得他们除了面包和白水以外，再给他一点儿肉类和青菜，偏偏这些他们压根儿都没想到，我估摸我还是先别掺和进去为好；不过，我打算等我自己过了眼前这一关，好歹要把医生说的话转告莎莉阿姨。我的意思是说，我总得给她解释解释：我跟她说到汤姆和我在那个倒霉的夜里划着小船四处去找那个在逃的黑人的时候，为什么我忘了给她提到锡德挨了枪伤这件事。

幸好我还有的是时间。莎莉阿姨整天整夜地守在病人的房间里。我每次见到赛拉斯姨父在那里晃晃悠悠地闲逛着，就连忙躲开了他。

转天早上，我听说汤姆已经大有起色了，他们说莎莉阿姨也回自己房间歇息去了。我就偷偷地走进病人的房间，我估摸只要他还醒着，我们不妨瞎编一个经得住考验的故事来哄骗这一家人。偏巧他正在睡觉，而且还睡得非常安详；他呀脸色煞白，不像刚来时那么烧得透红。于是，我就坐了下来，等着他醒过来。约莫过了半个钟头，冷不防莎莉阿姨悄悄地走进来，这一下我又走投无路了！可是她却给我摆摆手，叫我别做声；接着，她坐在我身边，悄悄地跟我说起话来。她说现在我们真可以说皆大欢喜了，因为他的所有症状全都好极了，他像这样安睡已有好长时间了，而且显得越来越见好，越来越安详，等他一醒过来，那时十之八九再也不会胡言乱语了。

于是，我们就坐在那儿守着。过了一会儿，他稍微挪动了一下，很自然地睁开了眼睛，望了一下，说：

“哦，我怎么会在家里呀！这是怎么回事？木筏在哪儿呀？”

“全都没事啦。”我说。

“还有吉姆呢？”

“也挺好。”我说，可我不能说得太轻率。不过，他并没注意到，只是说：

“好！那好极了！现在我们可平安无事啦！你跟阿姨说过了吗？”

我刚想说一声“是啊”，不料她却插嘴说：

“说什么呀，锡德？”

“嘿，就说这件事的来龙去脉呀。”

“什么这件事的来龙去脉呀？”

“不错，这一件事的来龙去脉呀，反正就只有这一件事嘛；那就是指我们怎么把那个在逃的黑人放走的事——就是我跟汤姆两个干的。”

“我的老天哪，放走了那个在逃——这个孩子在说些什么来着，哎呀，天哪，他又在胡言乱语啦！”

“不，我可不是胡言乱语；我说的事，我全都知道得清清楚楚。我们果真把他放走了——是我跟汤姆两个放的。事前我们都策划好了，后来果真就那么干开了。而且我们还干得非常出色。”他的话头已经打开了，她也不堵住他，只是坐在那儿瞪眼直瞅着他，好让他一口气说下去，所以，我知道我插嘴也是白搭。“哎呀，阿姨，这件事可让我们费了牛劲——一连干了好几个星期——每天夜里，你们全都睡着了的时候，我们还得苦干上好几个钟头。我们还得偷蜡烛、偷被单、偷衬衫，还有你的套裙，还有锡铝合金调羹、洋铁皮盘子、带鞘小刀、取暖炉、大磨石和面粉，还有说不完的其他东西；你压根儿想不到我们做锯子，磨钢笔，该有多么费劲，凿刻那些题词，以及做别的什么事儿，又是该有多么麻烦。不过，做这些事也够好玩儿的，可惜你连一半也想象不出来。我们还得画棺材和骷髅什么的画，写强盗投寄的匿名信，顺着避雷针爬上爬下，挖个地洞通到小屋里去，还得编制那挂绳梯，把它放在大馅儿饼里头烤，而且还要把调羹和其他干活用的东西，放在你的围裙口袋里，让你一块儿都给捎进去”——

“哎哟哟，我的天哪！”

“还让那个小屋里布满了耗子、蛇虫等等，给吉姆做伴儿。后来，你把汤姆滞留在这儿，让他帽子里头掖着的那块黄油融化了，差点儿把这件事全给弄糟了，因为我们还没有从小屋里爬出去，那些人就都赶到了，因此，我们只得没命似的往前冲，他们听见我们的脚步声就紧追不舍，于是我也挨了一枪，不过我们赶紧闪到路旁，让他们全都过去了，那些狗也赶过来了，却对我们不感兴趣，一个劲儿往顶顶闹猛的地方迅跑。后来，我们就踅摸到我们的小划子，朝我们的木筏那边划过去，我们全都平安无事，吉姆终于获救了，再也不去当奴隶啦。这些事都是靠我们自己做出来的，阿姨，你说可不是呱呱叫吗！”

“嘿，这样的事儿我活了一辈子还没听见过！惹出这么多麻烦来，原来就是你们呀，你们这两个不学好的小子！你们把大伙儿都弄得六神无主，我们也给吓得差点儿要死了。我真恨不得马上就狠揍你一顿。只要一想到我一夜接着一夜地在这儿守着——你这小淘气，只等你好了，我可要用鞭子把那恶魔从你们俩身上打掉！”

可是汤姆呢，他却感到洋洋得意，高兴极了，他简直按捺不住自己，他一个劲儿往下说话——她老爱插嘴，动不动乱嚷嚷，两个人谁都不肯相让，活像猫儿打架一样。随后，她说：

“得了，现在你们干这等事总觉得够痛快了吧。不过，我告诉你们，你们可要记住：往后我只要看见你们再去管他的闲事——”

“管谁的闲事呀？”汤姆说，他敛住笑容，露出吃惊的神色。

“还用问管谁呀？当然是指那个在逃的黑人呗。你以为是指谁呀？”

汤姆就铁板着脸直瞅我，说：

“汤姆，刚才你不是说他都挺好吗？难道说他还没有跑掉吗？”

“他？”莎莉阿姨说，“你是说那个在逃的黑人吗？他当然没跑掉。他们已把他活捉回来了，又关进那个小屋里去，给他吃的是面包和白水，还给他拴上了好几根铁链条，等着人家来认领，要不然干脆把他拍卖掉就得了！”

汤姆立时从床上坐起来，两眼直冒火，鼻子孔一启一闭，活像鱼鳃似的；他冲着我大声嚷道：

“他们没有权力把他关起来！快去呀！——一分钟也误不得，赶快把他放了吧！他早已不是奴隶了，他也跟这世界上自由地走来走去的人一样自由呀！”

“这个孩子说的什么话呀？”

“我说的句句都是实话，莎莉阿姨，要是没有人去，我自己就去。他这一辈子的事，我全都知道，汤姆他也知道。两个月以前，沃森老小姐死了，她本想把他卖到大河下游去，临死前她觉得挺羞愧，她就是这么说的；所以，她就在遗嘱里恢复他的自由了。”

“那么，既然你知道他已恢复自由了，为什么还要你来放走他呀？”

“哦，那倒真是个问题，我说；不过，你这话地地道道像女人家说的！老实说，我是想过过冒险的瘾儿；就是在齐脖子的血海里涉足而过，我也在所不惜——哎呀——天哪——波莉阿姨呀！”

她刚进门，挺立在那儿，莞尔而笑，活像一位天使似的，我可真的没想到！

莎莉阿姨立时冲她扑了过去，使劲儿搂着她，差点儿没把她的脑袋给搂掉了，稍后又向她哭了一会儿。我从床底下踅摸个地方躲一躲，因为我觉得这对我们着实够肉麻的。我就偷偷地往外窥视，过了一会儿，汤姆的波莉阿姨方才把她的妹妹甩掉了，站在那里，透过她那副眼镜顶上一个劲儿直瞅着汤姆——有点儿要让他钻进地底下去似的，你知道。随后，她说：

“得了，你最好还是把头偏过去——我要是你的话，我就会那么做，汤姆。”

“哎呀，我的天哪！”莎莉阿姨说，“难道说你的样子已经大变了吗？嘿，那不是汤姆，他是锡德；汤姆——汤姆——啊，汤姆上哪儿去了？刚才他还在这儿呢。”

“你是说哈克·费恩上哪儿去了吧——你准定是说他！我估摸，这么多年来，我把汤姆这淘气鬼拉扯大了，断断乎不会看见还不认得他吧。要不然就真的太不像话了。快从床底下爬出来吧，哈克·费恩。”

于是，我就爬出来了。可是我觉得怪难为情的。

莎莉阿姨那种晕头转向的神色，可真是少见得很。赛拉斯姨父走进来的时候，听说了这些事儿，更是懵懵懂懂了。这简直弄得他有点儿昏头昏脑，在后来多半天的时间里，他好像什么事儿都看不懂了，那天晚上他在一个祈祷会上讲道，竟然让他大出风头，因为连天底下的老寿星，也都听不懂他究竟讲的是什么话。随后，汤姆的波莉阿姨就告诉大家：我是谁，是个什么样的人；我也就只好硬着头皮说，当时我该有多么尴尬，所以费尔普斯太太把我当作汤姆·索亚的时候——她马上插嘴说：“得了，还是照旧管我叫莎莉阿姨吧，反正现在我已经听惯了，你也用不着再改口啦。”——所以莎莉阿姨把我当作汤姆·索亚的时候，我就只好将就一下，假冒汤姆——当时我确实没有别的办法，反正我知道汤姆也不会介意的，因为这种神乎其神的事在他看来怪好玩的，他还可以借它演一场奇遇记，痛痛快快地过把瘾。后来证明果真如此，他就索性假装锡德，事事尽可能让我感到轻松自如。

随后，他的波莉阿姨说，沃森老小姐在遗嘱里头确实说过要让吉姆恢复自由，汤姆说的都是真话。原来汤姆历尽艰辛地让一个业已获得自由的黑人恢复自由，也是千真万确啊！原先我怎么也闹不清，像他那样家庭出身的孩子，怎么会肯帮助别人给一个黑奴恢复自由；直到此刻，听完了他们这些话，我方才懂了。

波莉阿姨说莎莉阿姨给她去信，说汤姆和锡德都平安无事地到了，她就暗自思忖道：

“你看，果然是这样！我本该估计到，让他独个儿出门，可也不能没有人看管着他。我好像是始终也没接到过你的回信似的，所以，我就只好从一千一百英里以外，顺着大河长途跋涉，赶到这儿来，看看他这个小淘气鬼这回又耍什么花招来着。”

“哎呀，我压根儿就没接到过你的信。”莎莉阿姨说。

“嘿，这就怪了！得了，我前后给你写过两封信，问你怎么会说锡德也上这儿来了。”

“哦，你的信我从来就没接到过呀，姐姐。”

波莉阿姨慢悠悠地掉过身去，厉声地说：

“汤姆，你这个小东西！”

“哦——怎么回事啦？”他说，有点儿气呼呼似的。

“你休得反问我怎么回事，你这个愣头儿青——把那些信都交出来。”

“什么信呀？”

“那两封信。我敢肯定，要是我把你抓住了，我可——”

“信都在箱子里。这总行了吧。我打从邮局里取出来，原封不动地就搁在那儿了。我从来没有一，连碰一下也没有。可是我知道那些信会惹出麻烦来，所以我想，你要是不急的话，我会——”

“嘿，真该剥你的皮，一点儿也错不了。我另外还给你写过一封信，告诉你我要上这儿来了；我估摸他——”

“哦，那封信昨天接到了。我还没拆开看呢，不过那封信总算没出事，反正我接到了。”

我想拿两块美元打赌，我敢说她手里没有那封信，可是我转念一想，也许还是不说为妙。所以，我也就压根儿一气没吭。





尾声


我好不容易碰见汤姆，私底下就问他当初出逃的时候，他心里到底是怎么个想法？——如果说出逃非常顺顺当当，结果他给一个早已获得自由的黑人恢复了自由，那他又会策划些什么来着？他说，我们要是果真让吉姆平安无事地逃出去了，开头他脑子里策划的是：要我们叫他坐上木筏顺着大河漂下去，阅尽种种冒险经历，一直漂到大河口，随后告诉吉姆说他已经恢复自由了，大模大样地搭坐轮船，把他送回老家去，还要给他一些钱，作为赔偿他的误工费，而且事先要写封信回去，让那儿所有的黑人全都跑出来，搞一次火炬游行，再加上一支军乐队，欢天喜地簇拥着他回到小镇去。那时，他就成了英雄，我们俩也够神气的了。可是我觉得就像现在这样，也够风光的了。

我们马上就把吉姆身上的铁链条都去掉了，波莉阿姨、赛拉斯姨父、莎莉阿姨听说他帮着医生把汤姆护理得很出色，他们就大惊小怪地把他夸奖了一番，又给他换上顶呱呱的衣服，他想吃什么给什么，让他玩个痛快，什么活儿也不叫他干。后来，我们把他带到病人的房间里，兴高采烈地聊了一会儿；汤姆考虑到他替我们那么耐心地当囚犯，就赏给他四十块金币，吉姆可真是高兴得要命，突然大声叫道：

“你看，哈克，当时我跟你说过什么来着？——我在杰克逊岛上跟你说过什么来着？我告诉你说我胸口上长着毛，是个什么兆头，我说我从前富过一回，以后还得富起来；现在果然应验了吧；好运气终于来到了！你看，可不是吗？别再跟我瞎掰啦——兆头总归是兆头，我的这句话，你可千万记住，我早就知道我还会富起来，断断乎不会有错！”

随后，汤姆就没完没了地神聊下去，他说哪天晚上我们三个人从这儿溜出去，备好出门行装，到印第安人保留地去，在那些印第安人当中做一些惊人的冒险活动，痛痛快快地玩它两三个星期。我说，那敢情好，这我倒是很合意的，可我没有钱置备出门行装，而且我估摸向家里要钱也不行，因为老爸也许早已回去了，从撒切尔法官那里把钱都要过去，通通给喝光了。

“不，他并没有回去，”汤姆说，“你的钱还都在那儿呢——总共是六千多块金币；你老爸从来也没有回去过。反正我那回出来的时候，还没见过他回去呢。”

吉姆仿佛一本正经地说：

“他再也不会回去了，哈克。”

我说：

“为什么呀，吉姆？”

“别管它为什么，哈克——反正他再也不会回去了。”

可我还是一个劲儿地追问他；所以，他到了最后才说：

“你记不记得从河上漂下来的那座木板房，那里头有一个人身上用布盖着，我一进去，把布揭开一看，可就是不让你进去？得了，反正什么时候你要钱，都能取到钱的，因为木板房里那个人就是你老爸。”

现在汤姆差不多痊愈了，他把他那颗子弹拴到一根表链上，当作一只表，他常常拿它来看看是什么时候了。所以再也没有什么可写的了。不过，我还是觉得很高兴，因为我早知道写一本书有这么麻烦，压根儿就不会动笔，以后也不会再写了。可是我估摸我得赶在他们俩之前，先溜到印第安人保留地去，因为莎莉阿姨打算收我做干儿子，来管教管教我，那个我可受不了。我早就领教过了。

Explanatory


In this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the Missouri Negro dialect; the extremist form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect; the ordinary “Pike County” dialect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a hap-hazard fashion, or by guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.

I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding.





Mark Twain





Chapter I


You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom's Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.

Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece—all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.

The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.

After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time;so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people.

Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.

Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, “Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry”; and “Don't scrunch up like that, Huckleberry—set up straight”; and pretty soon she would say,“Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry—why don't you try to behave?” Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.

Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.

Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars was shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippo-will and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so downhearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider.

I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees—something was a-stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!” down there. That was good! Says I, “me-yow! me-yow! ” as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.





Chapter II


We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:

“Who dah?”

He listened some more; then he came tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could 'a' touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy—if you are anywheres where it don't do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upward of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says:

“Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n. Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it ag'in.”

So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy;next he begun to snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.

Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.

As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the state, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know 'bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece around his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got so stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.

Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop, we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Joe Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.

We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't 'a' noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:

“Now we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name in blood.”

Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.

Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head. He said some of it, but the rest was out of pirate books and robber books, and every gang that was high-toned had it. Some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:

“Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout him?”

“Well, hain't he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.

“Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more.”

They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of anything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson—they could kill her. Everybody said:

“Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in.”

Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.

“Now,” says Ben Rogers, “What's the line of business of this Gang?”

“Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.

“But who are we going to rob? —houses, or cattle, or—”

“Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,” says Tom Sawyer. “We ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.”

“Must we always kill the people?”

“Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different, but mostly it's considered best to kill them—except some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.”

“Ransomed? What's that?”

“I don't know. But that's what they do. I've seen it in books; and so of course that's what we've got to do.”

“But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?”

“Why, blame it all, we've got to do it. Don't I tell you it's in the books? Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books, and get things all muddled up?”

“Oh, that's all very fine to say, Tom Sawyer, but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to them? —that's the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it is?”

“Well, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed, it means that we keep them till they're dead.”

“Now, that's something like. That'll answer. Why couldn't you said that before? We'll keep them till they're ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they'll be, too—eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.”

“How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”

“A guard! Well, that is good. So somebody's got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that's foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here?”

“Because it ain't in the books so—that's why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don't you? —that's the idea. Don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do? Do you reckon you can learn 'em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.”

“All right. I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?”

“Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. Kill the women? No, nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home any more.”

“Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it. Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say.”

Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't want to be a robber any more.

So they all made fun of him, and called him crybaby, and that made him mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.

Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, only Sundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so started home.

I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking. My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.





Chapter III


Well, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes; but the widow she didn't scold, but only cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn't so. I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn't any good to me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but somehow I couldn't make it work. By and by, one day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me why, and I couldn't make it out no way.

I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it. I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to myself, there ain't nothing in it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” This was too many for me, but she told me what she meant—I must help other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it—except for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's mouth water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Watson's got him there warn't no help for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong to the widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.

Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable for me; I didn't want to see him no more. He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me;though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this time he was found in the river drowned, about twelve miles above town, so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drowned man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the water. They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn't comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. I knowed mighty well that a drownded man don't float on his back, but on his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap, but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes. So I was uncomfortable again. I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished he wouldn't.

We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn't robbed nobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs“ingots,” and he called the turnips and stuff “julery”, and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed and marked. But I couldn't see no profit in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a thousand “Sumter” mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. It warn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymnbook and a tract; and then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut. I didn't see no di'monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't so ignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians, and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the thing for us to do was go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull.

“Why,” says he, “a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson. They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.”

“Well,” I says, “s'pose we got some genies to help us—can't we lick the other crowd then?”

“How you going to get them?”

“I don't know. How do they get them?”

“Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do it. They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it—or any other man.”

“Who makes them tear around so?”

“Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says. If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an emperor's daughter from China for you to marry, they've got to do it—and they've got to do it before sunup next morning, too. And more: they've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it, you understand.”

“Well,” says I, “I think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead of fooling them away like that. And what's more—if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp.”

“How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you'd have to come when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.”

“What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All right, then; I would come; but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country.”

“Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You don't seem to know anything, somehow—perfect saphead.”

I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't no use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies. I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had all the marks of a Sunday school.





Chapter IV


Well, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever. I don't take no stock in mathematics, anyway.

At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hooky, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me. Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn't ashamed of me.

One morning I happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!” The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.

I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody's tracks. They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile awhile, and then went on around the garden fence. It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so. I couldn't make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I didn't notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the left bootheel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.

I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my shoulder every now and then, but I didn't see nobody. I was at Judge Thatcher's as quick as I could get there. He said:

“Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your interest?”

“No sir,” I says; “is there some for me?”

“Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night—over a hundred and fifty dollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you'll spend it.”

“No, sir,” I says, “I don't want to spend it. I don't want it at all—nor the six thousand, nuther. I want you to take it; I want to give it to you—the six thousand and all.”

He looked surprised. He couldn't seem to make it out. He says:

“Why, what can you mean, my boy?”

I says, “Don't you ask me no questions about it, please. You'll take it—won't you?”

He says:

“Well, I'm puzzled. Is something the matter?”

“Please take it,” says I, “and don't ask me nothing—then I won't have to tell no lies.”

He studied awhile, and then he says:

“Oho-o! I think I see. You want to sell all your property to me—not give it. That's the correct idea.”

Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:

“There; you see it says ‘for a consideration'. That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. Here's a dollar for you. Now you sign it.”

So I signed it, and left.

Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hairball as big as your fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got out his hairball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hairball would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference. Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hairball would think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hairball. Well I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.

Jim put the quarter under the hairball, and got down and listened again. This time he said the hairball was all right. He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the hairball talked to Jim and Jim told it to me. He says:

“Yo' 'ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyne to do. Sometimes he spec he'll go 'way, en den ag'in he spec he'll stay. De bes' way is to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way. Dey's two angels hoverin' round 'bout him. One uv 'em is white en shiny, en t'other one is black. De white one gits him to go right a little while, den de black one sail in en bust it all up. A body can't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las'. But you is all right. You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo' life, en considable joy. Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, en sometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you's gwyne to git well ag'in. Dey's two gals flyin' 'bout you in yo' life. One uv 'em's light en t'other one is dark. One is rich en t'other is po'. You's gwyne to marry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by. You wants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin, en don't run no resk, 'kase it's down in de bills dat you's gwyne to git hung.”

When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there set pap—his own self!





Chapter V


I had shut the door to. Then I turned around, and there he was. I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken—that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see I warn't scared of him worth bothering about.

He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long, mixed-up whiskers. There warn't no color in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl—a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his clothes—just rags, that was all. He had one ankle resting on t'other knee; the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and he worked them now and then. His hat was laying on the floor—an old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.

I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair tilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me all over. By and by he says:

“Starchy clothes—very. You think you're a good deal of a big-bug, don't you?”

“Maybe I am, maybe I ain't,” I says.

“Don't you give me none o' your lip,” says he. “You've put on considerble many frills since I been away. I'll take you down a peg before I get done with you. You're educated, too, they say—can read and write. You think you're better'n your father, now, don't you, because he can't? I'll take it out of you. Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut'n foolishness, hey? —who told you you could?”

“The widow. She told me.”

“The widow, hey? —and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ain't none of her business?”

“Nobody never told her.”

“Well, I'll learn her how to meddle. And looky here—you drop that school, you hear? I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better'n what he is. You lemme catch you fooling around that school again, you hear? Your mother couldn't read, and she couldn't write, nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn't before they died. I can't; and here you're a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain't the man to stand it—you hear? Say, lemme hear you read.”

I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars. When I'd read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:

“It's so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you told me. Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. I won't have it. I'll lay for you, my smarty; and if I catch you about that school I'll tan you good. First you know you'll get religion, too. I never see such a son.”

He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and says:

“What's this?”

“It's something they give me for learning my lessons good.”

He tore it up, and says:

“I'll give you something better—I'll give you a cowhide.”

He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:

“Ain't you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed; and bedclothes;and a look'n'glass; and a piece of carpet on the floor—and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such a son. I bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' you before I'm done with you. Why, there ain't no end to your airs—they say you're rich. Hey? —how's that?”

“They lie—that's how.”

“Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can stand now—so don't gimme no sass. I've been in town two days, and I hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. That's why I come. You git me that money to-morrow—I want it.”

“I hain't got no money.”

“It's a lie. Judge Thatcher's got it. You git it. I want it.”

“I hain't got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge Thatcher; he'll tell you the same.”

“All right. I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle, too, or I'll know the reason why. Say, how much you got in your pocket? I want it.”

“I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to—”

“It don't make no difference what you want it for—you just shell it out.”

He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going downtown to get some whisky; said he hadn't had a drink all day. When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I didn't drop that.

Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher's and bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn't, and then he swore he'd make the law force him.

The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had just come, and he didn't know the old man; so he said courts mustn't interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he'd druther not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business.

That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. He said he'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn't raise some money for him. I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then they jailed him, and the next day they had him before court, and jailed him again for a week. But he said he was satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he'd make it warm for him.

When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. So he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he'd been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn't be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said he could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap said he'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried again. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand, and says:

“Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it. There's a hand that was the hand of a hog, but it ain't so no more; it's the hand of a man that's started in on a new life, and 'll die before he'll go back. You mark them words—don't forget I said them. It's a clean hand now; shake it—don't be afeard.”

So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The judge's wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a pledge—made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sunup. And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it.

The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn't know no other way.





Chapter VI


Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him or outrun him most of the time. I didn't want to go to school much before, but I reckoned I'd go now to spite pap. That law trial was a slow business—appeared like they warn't ever going to get started on it; so every now and then I'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was just suited—this kind of thing was right in his line.

He got to hanging around the widow's too much, and so she told him at last that if he didn't quit using around there she would make trouble for him. Well, wasn't he mad? He said he would show who was Huck Finn's boss. So he watched out for me one day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three miles in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn't know where it was.

He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon, and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it—all but the cowhide part.

It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever got to like it so well at the widow's, where you had to wash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time. I didn't want to go back no more. I had stopped cussing, because the widow didn't like it; but now I took to it again because pap hadn't no objections. It was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it all around.

But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry, and I couldn't stand it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too, and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days. It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drowned, and I wasn't ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn't find no way. There warn't a window to it big enought for a dog to get through. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was too narrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time. But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty wood saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was an old horse blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out—big enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap's gun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap came in.

Pap warn't in a good humor—so he was his natural self. He said he was downtown, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed there'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This shook me up considerable, because I didn't want to go back to the widow's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadn't skipped any, and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of people which he didn't know the names of, and so called them what's-his-name when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.

He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they dropped and they couldn't find me. That made me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got that chance.

The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn't stay in one place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly nighttimes, and hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow couldn't ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.

I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body would 'a' thought he was Adam—he was just all mud. Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment. This time he says:

“Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it's like. Here's the law a-standing ready to take a man's son away from him—a man's own son, which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin' for him and give him a rest, the law up and goes for him. And they call that govment! That ain't all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' my property. Here's what the law does: The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up'ards, and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. They call that govment! A man can't get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I told 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of 'em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I'd leave the blamed country and never come a-near it ag'in. Them's the very words. I says, look at my hat—if you call it a hat—but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it's below my chin, and then it ain't rightly a hat at all, but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o' stove pipe. Look at it, says I—such a hat for me to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town, if I could git my rights.

“Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and the shiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that's got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and a silver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what do you think? They said he was a p'fessor in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed everything. And that ain't the wust. They said he could vote when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? It was 'lection day, and I was just about to go and vote myself if I warn't too drunk to get there;but when they told me there was a state in this country where they'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'll never vote ag'in. Them's the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all me—I'll never vote ag'in as long as I live. And to see the cool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn't 'a' give me the road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. I says to the people, why ain't this nigger put up at auction and sold—that's what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they said he couldn't be sold till he'd been in the state six months, and he hadn't been there that long yet. There, now—that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can't sell a free nigger till he's been in the state six months. Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, and yet's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a-hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted nigger, and—”

Pap was a-going on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language—mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn't good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.

After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other. He drank and drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way.He didn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn't keep my eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and the candle burning.

I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say one had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn't see no snakes. He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take him off! take him off! he's biting me on the neck!” I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by, and laid still awhile, moaning. Then he laid stiller, and didn't make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low:

“Tramp—tramp—tramp; that's the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp;they're coming after me; but I won't go. Oh, they're here! don't touch me—don't! hands off—they're cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!”

Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could hear him through the blanket.

By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a clasp knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me, and then I couldn't come for him no more. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; but he laughed such a screechy laugh, and roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.

So he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, and then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the time did drag along.





Chapter VII


“Git up! what you 'bout!”

I opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where I was. It was after sunup, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me looking sour—and sick, too. He says:

“What you doin' with this gun?”

I judged he didn't know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says:

“Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”

“Why didn't you roust me out?”

“Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budge you.”

“Well, all right. Don't stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there's a fish on the lines for breakfast. I'll be along in a minute.”

He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the riverbank. I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the woodyards and the sawmill.

I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him. But it warn't so this time. It was a drift canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she's worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea; I judged I'd hide her good, and then, 'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.

It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn't seen anything.

When he got along, I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home.

While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me;you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn't see no way for awhile, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he says:

“Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you hear? That man warn't here for no good. I'd 'a' shot him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?”

Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won't think of following me.

About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft—nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would 'a' waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn't pap's style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half past three. I judged he wouldn't come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw and went to work on that log again. Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.

I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky jug. I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd; took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffeepot. I took fish lines and matches and other things—everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an ax, but there wasn't any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.

I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back in its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn't quite touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin and it warn't likely anybody would go fooling around there.

It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.

I took the ax and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the ax, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground—hard-packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.

Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the place—pap done everything with his clasp knife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.

It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the place.

I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could 'a' counted the drift logs that went a slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and smelt late. You know what I mean—I don't know the words to put it in.

I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was—a skiff, away across the water. I couldn't tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it. Thinks I, maybe it's pap, though I warn't expecting him. He dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could 'a' reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it was pap, sure enough—and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.

I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down-stream soft, but quick, in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too—every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now. T'other one said this warn't one of the short ones, he reckoned—and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they laughed again;then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old woman—she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.

I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson's Island, about two mile and a half downstream, heavy-timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar at the head—it was all under water now.

It didn't take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could 'a' seen the canoe from the outside.

I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A monstrous big lumber raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say,“Stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!” I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side.

There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods and laid down for a nap before breakfast.





Chapter VIII


The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly.

I was powerful lazy and comfortable—didn't want to get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I think I hears a deep sound of “boom!” away up the river. I rouses up, and rests my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and looked out a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up—about abreast the ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter, now. “Boom!” I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferry-boat's side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to the top.

I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the cannon smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning—so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore—I knowed enough for that. But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was “Baker's bread”—what the quality eat; none of your low-down cornpone.

I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that thing—that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for only just the right kind.

I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place. Where the log forked I could peep through.

By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could 'a' run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Joe Harper, and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:

“Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge. I hope so, anyway.”

I didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out:“Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they'd 'a' had some bullets in, I reckon they'd a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island. I could hear the booming now and then, further and further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn't yet awhile. They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in awhile as they went. I crossed over to that side and watched them. When they got abreast of the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town.

I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't get at them. I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my campfire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.

When it was dark I set by my campfire smoking, and feeling pretty well satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, you soon get over it.

And so for three days and nights. No difference—just the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They would all come handy by and by, I judged.

Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot nothing, it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a campfire that was still smoking.

My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;and so on, and so on; if I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too. When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand in my craw;but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last-year's camp, and then clumb a tree.

I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing, I didn't hear nothing—I only thought I heard and seen as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.

By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank—about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk, and says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn't got far when I hear a man say:

“We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about beat out. Let's look around.”

I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.

I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn't do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way;I'm a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.

So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and brung the nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods. I set down there on a log, and looked out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that campfire, stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire, away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the fantods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I says:

“Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.

He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his knees, and puts his hands together and says:

“Doan' hurt me—don't! I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'. I awluz liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em. You go en git in de river agin, whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at 'uz awluz yo' fren'.”

Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn't lonesome now. I told him I warn't afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing. Then I says:

“It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make up your campfire good.”

“What's de use er makin' up de campfire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain't you? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.”

“Strawberries and such truck,” I says. “Is that what you live on?”

“I couldn' git nuffn else,” he says.

“Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”

“I come heah de night arter you's killed.”

“What, all that time?”

“Yes—indeedy.”

“And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”

“No, sah—nuffn else.”

“Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?”

“I reck'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan'?”

“Since the night I got killed.”

“No! W'y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat's good. Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.”

So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee pot and frying pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and fried him.

When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.

By and by Jim says:

“But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killed in dat shanty ef it warn't you?”

Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no better plan than what I had. Then I says:

“How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd you get here?”

He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing for a minute. Then he says:

“Maybe I better not tell.”

“Why, Jim?”

“Well, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on me ef I 'uz to tell you, would you, Huck?”

“Blamed if I would, Jim.”

“Well, I b'lieve you, Huck. I—I run off.”

“Jim!”

“But mind, you said you wouldn't tell—you know you said you wouldn't tell, Huck.”

“Well, I did. I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it. Honest injun, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don't make no difference. I ain't a-going to tell, and I ain't a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le's know all about it.”

“Well, you see, it' uz dis way. Ole Missus—dat's Miss Watson—she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn' sell me down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun' de place considable lately, en I begin to git oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do' pooty late, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans, but she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'd dollars for me, en it 'uz sich a big stack o' money she couldn' resis'. De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'. I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.

“I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal a skit 'long de sho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumbledown cooper shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go 'way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time. 'Long 'bout six in de mawnin', skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er nine every skit dat went 'long was talkin' 'bout how yo' pap come over to de town en say you's killed. Dese las' skifts wuz full o' ladies en genlmen a-goin' over for to see de place. Sometimes dey'd pull up at de sho' en take a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to know all 'bout de killin'. I 'uz powerful sorry you's killed, Huck, but I ain't no mo' now.

“I laid dah under de shavin's all day. I 'uz hungry, but I warn't afeared; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin' to start to de camp meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, so dey wouldn' 'spec to see me roun' de place, en so dey wouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'. De yuther servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way.

“Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went 'bout two mile er more to whah dey warn't no houses. I'd made up my mine 'bout what I's a-gwyne to do. You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to git away afoot, de dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey'd miss dat skift, you see, en dey'd know 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I's arter, it don' make no track.

“I see a light a-comin'roun'de p'int bymeby, so I wade' in en shove' a log ahead o' me en swum more'n half-way acrost de river, en got in 'mongst de driftwood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swum again de current tell de raff come along. Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en 'uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down on de planks. De men 'uz all 'way yonder in de middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good current; so I reck'n'd 'at by fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I'd slip in jis' b'fo daylight, en swim asho', en take to de woods on de Illinois side.

“But I didn'have no luck. When we 'uz mos' down to de head er de islan' a man begin to come aft wid de lantern. I see it warn't no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck out fer de islan'. Well, I had a notion I could lan' mos' anywheres, but I couldn't—bank too bluff. I 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I foun' a good place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as dey move de lantern roun' so. I had my pipe en a plug er dog-leg en some matches in my cap, en dey warn't wet, so I 'uz all right.”

“And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat all this time? Why didn't you get mud-turkles?”

“How you gwyne to git 'm? You can't slip up on um en grab um;en how's a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How could a body do it in de night? En I warn't gwyne to show myself on de bank in de daytime.”

“Well, that's so. You've had to keep in the woods all the time, of course. Did you hear 'em shooting the cannon?”

“Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by heah—watched um thoo de bushes.”

Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn't let me. He said it was death. He said his father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old granny said his father would die, and he did.

And Jim said you musn't count the things you are going to cook for dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the tablecloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died, the bees must be told about it before sunup next morning, or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim said bees wouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn't sting me.

I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked him if there warn't any good-luck signs. He says:

“Mighty few—an' dey ain' no use to a body. What you want to know when good luck's a-comin' for? Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you's got hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat you's a-gwyne to be rich. Well, dey's some use in a sign like dat, 'kase it's so fur ahead. You see, maybe you's got to be po' a long time fust, en so you might git discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn'know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”

“Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”

“What's de use to ax dat question? Don't you see I has?”

“Well, are you rich?”

“No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich ag'in. Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out.”

“What did you speculate in, Jim?”

“Well, fust I tackled stock.”

“What kind of stock?”

“Why, live stock—cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow. But I ain't gwyne to resk no mo' money in stock. De cow up 'n' died on my han's.”

“So you lost the ten dollars.”

“No, I didn'lose it all. I on'y los' 'bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.”

“You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate any more?”

“Yes. You know that dat one-laigged nigger dat b'longs to old Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo' dollars mo' at de en' er de year. Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn'have much. I wuz de on'y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo' dan fo' dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'd start a bank mysef. Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me out er de business, bekase he say dey warn't business 'nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en' er de year.

“So I done it. Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin'. Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn'know it; en I bought it off'n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en' er de year come; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night, en nex' day de one-laigged nigger say de bank's busted. So dey didn' none uv us git no money.”

“What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”

“Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream, en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name' Balum—Balum's Ass dey call him for short; he's one er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he's lucky, dey say, en I see I warn't lucky. De dream say let Balum inves' de ten cents en he'd make a raise for me. Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po' len' to de Lord, en boun' to git his money back a hund'd times. So Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it.”

“Well, what did come of it, Jim?”

“Nuffn never come of it. I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way; en Balum he couldn'. I ain'gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I see de security. Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'd times, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten cents back, I'd call it squah, en be glad er de chanst.”

“Well, it's all right, anyway, Jim, long as you're going to be rich again some time or other.”

“Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it. I owns myself, en I's wuth eight hundred dollars. I wisht I had de money, I wouldn' want no mo'.”





Chapter IX


I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.

This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there, right away, but I said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.

Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to get wet?

So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.

The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit; and was flat and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.

We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest-fst! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of treetops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling down the sky towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels downstairs—where it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.

“Jim, this is nice,” I says. “I wouldn't want to be nowhere else but here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread.”

“Well, you wouldn't 'a' ben here, 'f it hadn't 'a' ben for Jim. You'd 'a' ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner, an gittn' mos' drownded, too, dat you would, honey. Chickens knows when it's gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.”

The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across—a half a mile—because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs.

Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe. It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles—they would slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of them. We could 'a' had pets enough if we'd wanted them.

One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft—nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches—a solid, level floor. We could see saw logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.

Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before daylight, here comes a frame house down, on the west side. She was a two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got aboard—clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.

The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:“Hello, you!”

But it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:

“De man ain't asleep—he's dead. You hold still—I'll go en see.”

He went, and bent down and looked, and says:

“It's a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He's ben shot in de back. I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan' look at his face—it's too gashly.”

I didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sunbonnet, and some women's under-clothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe—it might come good. There was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too. And there was a bottle that had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We would 'a' took the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk, with the hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.

We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher knife without any handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and a fish line as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog collar, and a horse-shoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good currycomb, and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle bow, and a wooden leg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find the other one, though we hunted all around.

And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank, and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. We got home all safe.





Chapter X


After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man that warn't buried was more likely to go a-ha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.

We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed the money was there they wouldn't a left it. I said I reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn't want to talk about that. I says:

“Now you think it's bad luck; but what did you say when I fetched in the snakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin with my hands. Well, here's your bad luck! We've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.”

“Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don't you git too peart. It's a-comin'. Mind I tell you, it's a-comin'.”

It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well, after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on the foot of Jim's blanket, ever so natural, thinking there'd be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake's mate was there, and bit him.

He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun to pour it down.

He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told me to chop off the snake's head and throw it away, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist, too. He said that would help. Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn't going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.

Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky.

Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take a-holt of a snakeskin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And he said that handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off the shot tower, and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn't see it. Pap told me. But anyway, it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.

Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would 'a' flung us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with a hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn't ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there; everybody buys some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry.

Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring-up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said, couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trowser legs to my knees and got into it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sunbonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stovepipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practised around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get to my britches pocket. I took notice, and done better.

I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.

I started across to the town from a little below the ferry landing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I didn't know her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that town that I didn't know. Now this was lucky, because I was weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and find me out. But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget I was a girl.





Chapter XI


“Come in,” says the woman, and I did. She says: “Take a cheer.”

I done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and says:

“What might your name be?”

“Sarah Williams.”

“Where 'bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?”

“No'm. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I've walked all the way and I'm all tired out.”

“Hungry, too, I reckon. I'll find you something.”

“No'm, I ain't hungry. I was so hungry I had to stop two mile below here at a farm; so I ain't hungry no more. It's what makes me so late. My mother's down sick, and out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at the upper end of the town, she says. I hain't ever been here before. Do you know him?”

“No; but I don't know everybody yet. I haven't lived here quite two weeks. It's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your bonnet.”

“No,” I says, “I'll rest awhile, I reckon, and go on. I ain't afeard of the dark.”

She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but her husband would be in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she'd send him along with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better off they used to was, and how they didn't know but they'd made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone—and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in this town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was murdered. I says:

“Who done it? We've heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville, but we don't know who 'twas that killed Huck Finn.”

“Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance of people here that'd like to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done it himself.”

“No—is that so?”

“Most everybody thought it at first. He'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”

“Why he—”

I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and never noticed I had put in at all:

“The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So there's a reward out for him—three hundred dollars. And there's a reward out for old Finn too—two hundred dollars. You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with. The judge give him some, and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain't come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit. People do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh, he's sly, I reckon. If he don't come back for a year he'll be all right. You can't prove anything on him, you know; everything will be quieted down then, and he'll walk into Huck's money as easy as nothing.”

“Yes, I reckon so, 'm. I don't see nothing in the way of it. Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?”

“Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But they'll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it out of him.”

“Why, are they after him yet?”

“Well, you're innocent, ain't you! Does three hundred dollars lay round every day for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger ain't far from here. I'm one of them—but I hain't talked it around. A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't anybody live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say any more, but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt. I hain't seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; but husband's going over to see—him and another man. He was gone up the river; but he got back today and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.”

I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. I had to do something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman stopped talking, I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to be interested—and I was, too—and says:

“Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get it. Is your husband going over there tonight?”

“Oh, yes. He went uptown with the man I was telling you of, to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. They'll go over after midnight.”

“Couldn't they see better if they was to wait till daytime?”

“Yes. And couldn't the nigger see better, too? After midnight he'll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his campfire all the better for the dark, if he's got one.”

“I didn't think of that.”

The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bit comfortable. Pretty soon she says:

“What did you say your name was, honey?”

“M-Mary Williams.”

Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I didn't look up—seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and was afeard maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the woman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was. But now she says:

“Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?”

“Oh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah's my first name. Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.”

“Oh, that's the way of it?”

“Yes'm.”

I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I couldn't look up yet.

Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't know whether she could throw true now. But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said “Ouch!” it hurt her arm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd 'a' stayed where he was he'd 'a' been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her husband's matters. But she broke off to say:

“Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap, handy.”

So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, but very pleasant, and says:

“Come, now, what's your real name?”

“Wh-hat, mum?”

“What's your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob? —or what is it?”

I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do. But I says:

“Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If I'm in the way here, I'll—”

“No, you won't. Set down and stay where you are. I ain't going to hurt you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your secret, and trust me. I'll keep it; and what's more, I'll help you. So'll my old man if you want him to. You see, you're a runaway 'prentice, that's all. It ain't anything. There ain't no harm in it. You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Bless you, child, I wouldn't tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that's a good boy.”

So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she mustn't go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.

“Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?”

“Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”

“He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.”

“Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. I got to be moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.”

“Hold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.”

So she put me up a snack, and says:

“Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer up prompt, now—don't stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?”

“The hind end, mum.”

“Well, then, a horse?”

“The for'rard end, mum.”

“Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?”

“North side.”

“If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction?”

“The whole fifteen, mum.”

“Well, I reckon you have lived in the country. I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again. What's your real name now?”

“George Peters, mum.”

“Well, try to remember it, George. Don't forget and tell me it's Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it's George-Elexander when I catch you. And don't go about women in that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t'other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a-tiptoe, and fetch your hand up over your head as awkard as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road's a rocky one, and your feet 'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, I reckon.”

I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went upstream far enough to make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the sunbonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear—eleven. When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.

Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the timber and up the ridge, and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:

“Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain't a minute to lose. They're after us!”

Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the campfire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.

I took the canoe out from shore a little piece, and took a look; but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still— never saying a word.





Chapter XII


It must 'a' been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing line, or anything to eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn't good judgment to put everything on the raft.

If the men went to the island I just expect they found the campfire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.

When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a tow-head in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A towhead is a sand bar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow teeth.

We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down and watch a campfire—no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must 'a' gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village—no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't.

When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of the reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down stream, to keep from getting run over;but we wouldn't have to light it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but hunted easy water.

This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather, as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next.

Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There warn't a sound there; everybody was asleep.

Every night now I used to slip ashore toward ten o'clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.

Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind. Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more—then he reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.

We shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all around, we lived pretty high.

The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, “Hel-lo, Jim, looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.

Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would 'a' felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was there. So I says:

“Le's land on her, Jim.”

But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:

“I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack. We's doin' blame' well, en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey's a watchman on dat wrack.”

“Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilothouse; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this, when it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?”Jim couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try. “And besides,” I says, “We might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom. Seegars, I bet you—and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and they don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure—that's what he'd call it; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't he throw style into it? —wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering KingdomCome. I wish Tom Sawyer was here.”

Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there.

The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark we couldn't see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb onto it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder!

Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say:

“Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!”

Another voice said, pretty loud:

“It's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this way before. You always want more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because you've swore't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time you've said it jest one time too many. You're the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country.”

By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now, and so I won't either; I'm agoing to see what's going on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but about one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and saying:

“I'd like to! And I orter, too—a mean skunk!”

The man on the floor would shrivel up and say: “Oh, please don't, Bill; I hain't ever goin' to tell.”

And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:

“'Deed you ain't! You never said no truer thing 'n that, you bet you.” And once he said: “Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn't got the best of him and tied him he'd 'a' killed us both. And what for? Jist for noth'n. Jist because we stood on our rights—that's what for. But I lay you ain't a-goin'to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put up that pistol, Bill.”

Bill says:

“I don't want to, Jake Packard. I'm for killin' him—and didn't he kill old Hatfield jist the same way—and don't he deserve it?”

“But I don't want him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.”

“Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you long's I live!” says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering.

Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was, there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good tune; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man come a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:

“Here—come in here.”

And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn't 'a' treed me because I didn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body couldn't breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:

“He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him now it wouldn't make no difference after the row and the way we've served him. Shore's you're born, he'll turn state's evidence; now you hear me. I'm for putting him out of his troubles.”

“So'm I,” says Packard, very quiet.

“Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasn't. Well, then, that's all right. Le's go and do it.”

“Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting's good, but there's quieter ways if the thing's got to be done. But what I say is this; it ain't good sense to go court'n around after a halter if you can git at what you're up to in some way that's jist as good and at the same time don't bring you into no resks. Ain't that so?”

“You bet it is. But how you goin'to manage it this time?”

“Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickin's we've overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we'll wait. Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more 'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He'll be drownded, and won't have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that's a considerble sight better'n killin' of him. I'm unfavorable to killin'a man as long as you can git aroun' it; it ain't good sense, it ain't good morals. Ain't I right?”

“Yes, I reck'n you are. But s'pose she don't break up and wash off?”

“Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can't we?”

“All right, then; come along.”

So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says:

“Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling around and moaning;there's a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can't get away from the wreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their boat we can put all of 'em in a bad fix—for the Sheriff'll get 'em. Quick—hurry! I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start at the raft, and—”

“Oh, my lordy, lordy! Raf 'Dey ain' no raf' no mo'; she done broke loose en gone! —en here we is!”





Chapter XIII


Well, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd got to find that boat now—had to have it for ourselves. So we went a'quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too—seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn't believe he could go any further—so scared he hadn't hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck, we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would 'a' been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:

“Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!”

He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down. It was Packard. Then Bill he come out and got in. Packard says, in a low voice:

“All ready—shove off!”

I couldn't hardly hang onto the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says:

“Hold on—'d you go through him?”

“No. Didn't you?”

“No. So he's got his share o' the cash yet.”

“Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”

“Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?”

“Maybe he won't. But we got to have it anyway. Come along.”

So they got out and went in.

The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come a tumbling after me. I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!

We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddlebox, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.

When we was three or four hundred yards down stream, we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.

Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the first time I begun to worry about the men—I reckon I hadn't had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain't no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would I like it? So says I to Jim:

“The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it's a good hiding place for you and the skiff, and then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes.”

But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds staid, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it.

It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four more showed—up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and By and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between his knees. I give his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to cry.

He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:

“Hello, what's up? Don't cry, bub. What's the trouble?”

I says:

“Pap, and mam, and sis, and—”

Then I broke down. He says:

“Oh, dang it now, don't take on so; we all has to have our troubles and this'n 'll come out all right. What's the matter with 'em?”

“They're—they're—are you the watchman of the boat?”

“Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. “I'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers. I ain't as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he does;but I've told him a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places with him;for, says I, a sailor's life's the life for me, and I'm derned if I'd live two mile out o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin'on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I—”

I broke in and says:

“They're in an awful peck of trouble, and—”

“Who is?”

“Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take your ferryboat and go up there—”

“Up where? Where are they?”

“On the wreck.”

“What wreck?”

“Why, there ain't but one.”

“What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?”

“Yes.”

“Good land! What are they doin' there, for gracious sakes?”

“Well, they didn't go there a-purpose.”

“I bet they didn't! Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?”

“Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town—”

“Yes, Booth's Landing—go on.”

“She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her—I disremember her name—and they lost their steeringoar, and swung around and went a-floating down, stern-first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferry man and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so we saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple—and oh, he was the best cretur! —I most wish't it had been me, I do.”

“My George! It's the beatenest thing I ever struck. And then what did you all do?”

“Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he'd fix the thing. I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, ‘what, in such a night and such a current? There ain't no sense in it; go for the steam-ferry.' Now if you'll go, and—”

“By Jackson, I'd like to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; but who in the dingnation's a-going to pay for it? Do you reckon your pap—”

“Why that's all right. Miss Hooker she told me, particular, that her uncle Hornback—”

“Great guns! is he her uncle? Looky here, you break for that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill. And don't you fool around any, because he'll want to know the news. Tell him I'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer.”

I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some wood-boats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would 'a' done it. I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and deadbeats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in.

Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chance for anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there wasn't any answer; all dead still. I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it I could.

Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long downstream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach, I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because the captain would know her uncle Horseback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river.

It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people.





Chapter XIV


By and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off the wreck, and found boots, blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars. We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferry-boat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he didn't want no more adventures. He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died, because he judged it was all up with him anyway it could be fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger.

I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, 'stead of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he was interested. He says:

“I didn' know dey was so many un um. I hain't hearn 'bout none un um, skasely, but old King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in a pack er k'yards. How much do a king git?”

“Get?” I says; “why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to them.”

“Ain' dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?”

“They don't do nothing! Why, how you talk! They just set around.”

“No; is dat so?”

“Of course it is. They just set around—except, maybe, when there's a war; then they go to the war. But other times they just lazy around, or go hawking—just hawking and sp—Sh! —d'you hear a noise?”

We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back.

“Yes,” says I, “and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the parlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off. But mostly they hang round the harem.”

“Roun' de which?”

“Harem.”

“What's de harem?”

“The place where he keeps his wives. Don't you know about the harem? Solomon had one; he had about a million wives.”

“Why, yes, dat's so; I—I'd done forgot it. A harem's a bo'd'n-house, I reck'n. Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. En I reck'n de wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket. Yit dey say Sollermun de wises' man dat ever liv'. I doan' take no stock in dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids'er sich a blim-blammin' all de time? No—'deed he wouldn't. A wise man 'ud take en buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet down de biler-factry when he wants to res'.”

“Well, but he was the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told me so, her own self.”

“I doan k'yer what de widder say, he warn't no wise man nuther. He had some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see. Does you know 'bout dat chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?”

“Yes, the widow told me all about it.”

“Well, den! Warn't dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'? You jus' take en look at it a minute. Dah's de stump, dah—dat's one er de women! heah's you—dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill's de chile. Bofe un you claims it. What does I do? Does I shin aroun' mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill do b'long to, en han' it over to de right one, all safe en soun, de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would? No; I take en whack de bill in two, en give half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman. Dat's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now I want to ast you:what's de use er dat half a bill? —can't buy noth'n wid it. En what use is a half a chile? I would'n give a dern for a million un um.”

“But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point—blame it, you've missed it a thousand mile.”

“Who? Me? Go 'long. Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints. I reck'n I knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's as dat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout a whole chile;en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain. Doan'talk to me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back.”

“But I tell you don't get the point.”

“Blame de pint! I reck'n I knows what I knows. En mine you, de real pint is down furder—it's down deeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was raised. You take a man dat's got on'y one er two chillen; is dat man gwyne be waseful o' chillen? No, he ain't; he can't'ford it. He know how value 'em. But you take a man dat's got 'bout five million chillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt. He as soon chop a chile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'. A chile er two, mo'er less, warn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad fetch him!”

I never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, there warn't no getting it out again. He was the most down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see. So I went to talking about other kings, and let Solomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say he died there.

“Po' little chap.”

“But some says he got out and got away, and come to America.”

“Dat's good! But he'll be pooty lonesome—dey ain' no kings here, is dey, Huck?”

“No.”

“Den he cain't git no situation. What he gwyne to do?”

“Well, I don't know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them learns people how to talk French.”

“Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we does?”

“No, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said—not a single word.”

“Well, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat comes?”

“I don't know; but it's so. I got some of their jabber out of a book. S'pose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy—what would you think?”

“I wouldn't think nuffn; I'd take en bust him over de head—dat is, if he warn't white. I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat.”

“Shucks, it ain't calling you anything. It's only saying, do you know how to talk French.”

“Well, den, why couldn't he say it?”

“Why, he is a-saying it. That's a Frenchman's way of saying it.”

“Well, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' want to hear no mo' ’bout it. Dey ain' no sense in it.”

“Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?”

“No, a cat don't.”

“Well, does a cow?”

“No, a cow don't, nuther.”

“Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like a cat?”

“No, dey don't.”

“It's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other, ain't it?”

“Course.”

“And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from us?”

“Why, mos' sholy it is.”

“Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for a Frenchman to talk different from us? You answer me that.”

“Is a cat a man, Huck?”

“No.”

“Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like a man. Is a cow a man? —er is a cow a cat?”

“No, she ain't either of them.”

“Well, den, she ain' got no business to talk like either one or the yuther of 'em. Is a Frenchman a man?”

“Yes.”

“Well, den! Dad blame it, why doan' he talk like a man? You answer me dat!”

I see it warn't no use wasting words—you can't learn a nigger to argue. So I quit.





Chapter XV


We judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo, at the bottom of Illinois, where the Ohio River comes in, and that was what we was after. We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States, and then be out of trouble.

Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn't do to try to run in fog; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't anything but little saplings to tie to. I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank, but there was a stiff current, and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went. I see the fog closing down, and it made me so sick and scared I couldn't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me—and then there warn't no raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn't come. I was in such a hurry I hadn't untied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I was so excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly do anything with them.

As soon as I got started I took out after the raft, hot and heavy, right down to the towhead. That was all right as far as it went, but the towhead warn't sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man.

Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'll run into the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet it's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time. I whooped and listened. Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it come I see I warn't heading for it but heading away to the right of it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it—and not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that and t'other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.

I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directly I hears the whoop behind me. I was tangled good now. That was somebody else's whoop, or else I was turned around.

I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's head down stream and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering. I couldn't tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't look natural nor sound natural in a fog.

The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the current was tearing by them so swift.

In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.

I just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it. It warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six mile long and more than a half a mile wide.

I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course, four or five mile an hour; but you don't ever think of that. No, you feel like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast you're going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag's tearing along. If you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once—you'll see.

Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn't do it, and directly I judged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a narrow channel between; and some that I couldn't see I knowed was there because I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn't long losing the whoops down amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'lantern. You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick and so much.

I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing—it was floating a little faster than what I was.

Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother no more. I didn't want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn't help it; so I thought I would take just one little cat nap.

But I reckon it was more than a cat nap, for when I waked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first. First I didn't know where I was; I thought I was dreaming; and when things begun to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week.

It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the stars. I looked away downstream, and seen a black speck on the water. I took out after it; but when I got to it it warn't nothing but a couple of saw logs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the raft.

When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering oar. The other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt. So she'd had a rough time.

I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on the raft, and began to gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:

“Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn't you stir me up?”

“Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain' dead—you ain't drownded—you's back ag'in? It's too good for true, honey, it's too good for true. Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you. No, you ain' dead! you's back ag'in, 'live en soun', jis de same ole Huck—de same ole Huck, thanks to goodness!”

“What's the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?”

“Drinkin'? Has I ben a-drinkin'? Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin'?”

“Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?”

“How does I talk wild?”

“How? why, haven't you been talking about my coming back, and all that stuff, as if I'd been gone away?”

“Huck—Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye. Hain't you ben gone away?”

“Gone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain't been gone anywheres. Where would I go to?”

“Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumfn wrong, dey is. Is I me, or who is I? Is I heah, or whah is I? Now dat's what I wants to know?”

“Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but I think you're a tangle-headed old fool, Jim.”

“I is, is I? Well you answer me dis: Didn't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de towhead?”

“No, I didn't. What towhead? I hain't seen no towhead.”

“You hain't seen no towhead? Looky here, didn't de line pull loose en de raf' go a hummin' down de river, en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?”

“What fog?”

“Why, de fog! —de fog dat's been aroun' all night. En didn't you whoop, en didn't I whoop, tell we got mix' up in de islands en one un us got los' en t'other one was jis' as good as los', 'kase he didn' know whah he wuz? En didn't I bust up again a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos' git drownded? Now ain't dat so, boss—ain't it so? You answer me dat.”

“Well, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain't seen no fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon I done the same. You couldn't 'a' got drunk in that time, so of course you've been dreaming.”

“Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?”

“Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn't any of it happen.”

“But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as—”

“It don't make no difference how plain it is; there ain't nothing in it. I know, because I've been here all the time.”

Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, but set there studying over it. Then he says:

“Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef it ain't de powerfulest dream I ever see. En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo' dat's tired me like dis one.”

“Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes. But this one was a staving dream; tell me all about it, Jim.”

So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must start in and “'terpret” it, because it was sent for a warning. He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good, but the current was another man that would get us away from him. The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if we didn't try hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us into bad luck, 'stead of keeping us out of it. The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the free states, and wouldn't have no more trouble.

It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was clearing up again now.

“Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes, Jim,” I says; “But what does these things stand for?”

It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. You could see them first-rate now.

Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash again. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away. But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:

“What do dey stan' for? I's gwyne to tell you. When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin' for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos' broke bekase you wuz los', en I didn' k'yer no' mo' what become er me en de raf'. En when I wake up en find you back ag'in, all safe en soun', de tears come, en I could 'a' got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot, I's so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin 'bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is trash; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed.”

Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without saying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed his foot to get him to take it back.

It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for it afterwards, neither. I didn't do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn't done that one if I'd 'a' knowed it would make him feel that way.





Chapter XVI


We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open campfire in the middle, and a tall flagpole at each end. There was a power of style about her. It amounted to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that.

We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim—and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited.

There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it. He said he'd be mighty sure to see it, because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he'd be in the slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says:

“Dah she is?”

But it warn't. It was Jack-o'lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. I couldn't get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it staid with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every time, “But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody.” That was so—I couldn't get around that, no way. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, “What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you, that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. That's what she done.”

I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, “Dah's Cairo!” it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it was Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.

Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Ab'litionist to go and steal them.

It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, “Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.” Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children—children that belonged to a man I didn't even know;a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.

I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it,“Let up on me—it ain't too late yet—I'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.” I felt easy and happy and light as a feather, right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By and by one showed. Jim sings out:

“We's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crack yo' heels, Dat's de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!”

I says:

“I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn't be, you know.”

He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:

“Pooty soon I'll be a-shout 'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn't ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck; you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de only fren' ole Jim's got now.”

I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:

“Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole Jim.”

Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I got to do it—I can't get out of it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says:

“What's that, yonder?”

“A piece of a raft,” I says.

“So you belong on it?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Any men on it?”

“Only one, sir.”

“Well, there's five niggers run off tonight up yonder, above the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?”

I didn't answer up promptly. I tried to, but the words wouldn't come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man enough—hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says:

“He's white.”

“I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves.”

“I wish you would,” says I, “because it's pap that's there, and maybe you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He's sick and so is mam and Mary Ann.”

“Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. But I s'pose we've got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along.”

I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a stroke or two, I says:

“Pap'll be mighty much obliged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do it by myself.”

“Well, that's infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what's the matter with your father?”

“It's the—a—the—well, it ain't anything, much.”

They stopped pulling. It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft now. One says:

“Boy, that's a lie. What is the matter with your pap? Answer up square now, and it'll be the better for you.”

“I will, sir, I will, honest—but don't leave us, please. It's the—the—Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won't have to come a-near the raft—please do.”

“Set her back, John, set her back!” says one. They backed water.“Keep away, boy—keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. Your pap's got the smallpox, and you know it precious well. Why didn't you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?”

“Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I've told everybody before, and they just went away and left us.”

“Poor devil, there's something in that. We are right down sorry for you, but we—well, hang it, we don't want the smallpox, you see. Look here, I'll tell you what to do. Don't you try to land by yourself, and you'll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sunup then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don't be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we're trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy. It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is—it's only a woodyard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck. Here, I'll put a twenty dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you;but my kingdom! it won't do to fool with smallpox, don't you see?”

“Hold on, Parker,” says the man, “Here's a twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'll be all right.”

“That's so, my boy—good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it.”

“Good-bye, sir,” says I; “I won't let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it.”

They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don't get started right when he's little ain't got no show—when the pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd 'a' done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? No, says I, I'd feel bad—I'd feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says I, what's the use you learning to do right, when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck. I couldn't answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever comes handiest at the time.

I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. I looked all around; he warn't anywhere. I says:

“Jim!”

“Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o' sight yit? Don't talk loud.”

He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard. He says:

“I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf' ag'in when dey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool 'em, Huck! Dat wuz de smartes' dodge! I tell you, chile, I 'speck it save' ole Jim—ole Jim ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey.”

Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise—twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.

Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting.

That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend.

I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says:

“Mister, is that town Cairo?”

“Cairo? no. You must be a blame' fool.”

“What town is it, mister?”

“If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin' around me for about a half minute longer you'll get something you won't want.”

I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.

We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again;but it was high ground, so I didn't go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did Jim. I says:

“Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.”

He says:

“Doan' let's talk about it, Huck. Po' niggers can't have no luck. I alwuz 'spected dat rattlesnake skin warn't done wid its work.”

“I wish I'd never seen that snakeskin, Jim—I do wish I'd never laid eyes on it.”

“It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know. Don't you blame yo'self 'bout it.”

When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with Cairo.

We talked it all over. It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn't no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone!

We didn't say a word for a good while. There warn't anything to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattle-snake skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck—and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.

By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in. We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us.

So we shoved out after dark on the raft.

Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a snakeskin, after all that snakeskin done for us, will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us.

The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more. Well, the night got gray and rather thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. You can't tell the shape of the river, and you can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it. Upstream boats didn't generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.

We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to try to shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glowworms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam—and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft.

I dived—and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckoned I stayed under a minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current;and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her.

I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,” and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.

It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clum up the bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log house before I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.





Chapter XVII


In about half a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out, and says:

“Be done, boys! Who's there?”

I says:

“It's me.”

“Who's me?”

“George Jackson, sir.”

“What do you want?”

“I don't want nothing, sir. I only want to go along by, but the dogs won't let me.”

“What are you prowling around here this time of night, for—hey?”

“I warn't prowling around, sir; I fell overboard off of the steamboat.”

“Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What did you say your name was?”

“George Jackson, sir. I'm only a boy.”

“Look here; if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid—nobody'll hurt you. But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?”

“No, sir, nobody.”

I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. The man sung out:

“Snatch that light away, Betsy you old fool—ain't you got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are ready, take your places.”

“All ready.”

“Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?”

“No, sir; I never heard of them.”

“Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. Now, all ready. Step forward, George Jackson. And mind, don't you hurry—come mighty slow. If there's anybody with you, let him keep back—if he shows himself he'll be shot. Come along now. Come slow; push the door open yourself—just enough to squeeze in, d' you hear?”

I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a-wanted to. I took one slow step at a time, and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps, I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said, “There, that's enough—put your head in.” I done it, but I judged they would take it off.

The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or more—all of them fine and handsome—and the sweetest old gray—headed lady, and back of her two young women which I couldn't see right well. The old gentleman says:

“There; I reckon it's all right. Come in.”

As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of range of the front windows—there warn't none on the side. They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, “Why he ain't a Shepherdson—no, there ain't any Shepherdson about him.” Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm by it—it was only to make sure. So he didn't pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself;but the old lady says:

“Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't you reckon it may be he's hungry?”

“True for you, Rachel—I forgot.”

So the old lady says:

“Betsy” (this was a nigger woman), “You fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him—oh, here he is himself. Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that's dry.”

Buck looked about as old as me—thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he was a little bigger than me. He hadn't on anything but a shirt, and he was very frowsy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one fist in his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one. He says:

“Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?”

They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.

“Well,” he says, “If they'd 'a' ben some, I reckon I'd 'a' got one.”

They all laughed, and Bob says:

“Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in coming.”

“Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right. I'm always kept down; I don't get no show.”

“Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “You'll have show enough, all in good time, don't you fret about that. Go 'long with you now, and do as your mother told you.”

When we got up stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a blue-jay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.

“Well, guess,” he says.

“How'm I going to guess,” says I, “When I never heard tell of it before?”

“But you can guess, can't you? It's just as easy.”

“Which candle?” I says.

“Why, any candle,” he says.

“I don't know where he was,” says I; “Where was he?”

“Why, he was in the dark! That's where he was!”

“Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?”

“Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? Say, how long are you going to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming times—they don't have no school now. Do you own a dog? I've got a dog—and he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet I don't, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches, I reckon I'd better put'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm. Are you all ready? All right. Come along, old hoss.”

Cold corn pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk—that is what they had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've come across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it. Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:

“Can you spell, Buck?”

“Yes,” he says.

“I bet you can't spell my name,” says I.

“I bet you what you dare I can,” says he.

“All right,” says I, “go ahead.”

“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n—there now.” he says.

“Well,” says I, “You done it, but I didn't think you could. It ain't no slouch of a name to spell—right off without studying.”

I set it down, private, because somebody might want me to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it.

It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style. It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, not a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red waterpaint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dogirons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick;sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn't took any money for her.

Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.

This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn't say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. There was a HymnBook, and a lot of other books. And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too—not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.

They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing the Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before—blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.” Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.”There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.” These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fantods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.

This young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:





Ode to Stephen Dowling Bots, Dec'd.





And did young Stephen sicken,

　　And did young Stephen die?

And did the sad hearts thicken,

　　And did the mourners cry?





No; such was not the fate of

　　Young Stephen Dowling Bots;

Though sad hearts round him thickened,

　　’Twas not from sickness'shots.





No whooping-cough did rack his frame,

　　Nor measles drear with spots;

Not these impaired the sacred name

　　Of Stephen Dowling Bots.





Despised love struck not with woe

　　That head of curly knots,

Nor stomach troubles laid him low,

　　Young Stephen Dowling Bots.





O no. Then list with tearful eye,

　　Whilst I his fate do tell.

His soul did from this cold world fly

　　By falling down a well.





They got him out and emptied him;

　　Alas it was too late;

His spirit was gone for to sport aloft

　　In the realms of the good and great.





If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could 'a' done by and by. Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn't particular, she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her “tribute” before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker—the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was Whistler. She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.

Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link is Broken” and play “The Battle of Prague” on it. The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.

It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn't be better. And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too!





Chapter XVIII


Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean-shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was gray and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tailcoat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn't no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud. He was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning began to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloud bank it was awful dark for a half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.

When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good day, and didn't set down again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and madam”; and they bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old people too.

Bob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore broad Panama hats.

Then there was Miss Charlotte, she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as she could be when she warn't stirred up; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like her father. She was beautiful.

So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.

Each person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn't used to having anybody do anything for me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.

This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more—three sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.

The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers. Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.

There was another clan of aristocracy around there—five or six families—mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing, which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses.

One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse coming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:

“Quick! Jump for the woods!”

We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty soon a splendid young man came galloping down the road, setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel. I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn't wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come—to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see. We never stopped running till we got home. The old gentleman's eyes blazed a minute—'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged—then his face sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle:

“I don't like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn't you step into the road, my boy?”

“The Shepherdsons don't, father. They always take advantage.”

Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two young men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turned pale, but the color came back when she found the man warn't hurt.

Soon as I could get Buck down by the corncribs under the trees by ourselves, I says:

“Did you want to kill him, Buck?”

“Well, I bet I did.”

“What did he do to you?”

“Him? He never done nothing to me.”

“Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”

“Why, nothing—only it's on account of the feud.”

“What's a feud?”

“Why, where was you raised? Don't you know what a feud is?”

“Never heard of it before—tell me about it.”

“Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills him; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the cousins chip in—and by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't no more feud. But it's kind of slow, and takes a long time.”

“Has this one been going on long, Buck?”

“Well I should reckon! it started thirty year ago, or som'ers along there. There was trouble 'bout something, and then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the man that won the suit—which he would naturally do, of course. Anybody would.”

“What was the trouble about, Buck? —land?”

“I reckon maybe—I don't know.”

“Well, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson?”

“Laws, how do I know? It was so long ago.”

“Don't anybody know?”

“Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old folks; but they don't know now what the row was about in the first place.”

“Has there been many killed, Buck?”

“Yes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don't always kill. Pa's got a few buckshot in him; but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh much; anyway. Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom's been hurt once or twice.”

“Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”

“Yes, we got one and they got one. 'Bout three months ago my cousin Bud, fourteen years old, was riding through the woods on t'other side of the river, and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame' foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could outrun him;so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile and more, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down. But he didn't git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week our folks laid him out.”

“I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”

“I reckon he warn't a coward. Not by a blame' sight. There ain't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons—not a one. And there ain't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep' up his end in a fight one day for a half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be fetched home—and one of 'em was dead, and another died the next day. No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards he don't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons, becuz they don't breed any of that kind.”

Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The Shepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching—all about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.

About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she'd forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summertime because it's cool. If you notice, most folks don't go to church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.

Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament. so I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with “Half past two” wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else. I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face, for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her “no, only coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper warn't anything but a bookmark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.

I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes a-running, and says:

“Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swamp I'll show you a whole stack o' water moccasins.”

Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He oughter know a body don't love water moccasins enough to go around hunting for them. What is he up to, anyway? So I says:

“All right; trot ahead.”

I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded ankle-deep as much as another half mile. We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines, and he says:

“You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah's whah dey is. I's seed 'm befo'; I don't k'yer to see 'em no mo'.”

Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid him. I poked into the place aways, and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying there asleep—and, by jings, it was my old Jim!

I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again, but it warn't. He nearly cried he was so glad, but he warn't surprised. Said he swum along behind me that night, and heard me yell every time, but dasn't answer, because he didn't want nobody to pick him up and take him into slavery again. Says he:

“I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las'; when you landed I reck'ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan' 'dout havin' to shout at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow. I'uz off too fur to hear what dey say to you—I wuz 'fraid o' de dogs; but when it 'uz all quiet ag'in I knowed you's in de house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Early in de mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey tuck me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can't track me on accounts o' de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells me how you's a-gittin' along.”

“Why didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?”

“Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell we could do sumfn—but we's all right, now. I ben a-buyin' pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights when—”

“What raft, Jim?”

“Our ole raf'.”

“You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed all to flinders?”

“No, she warn't. She was tore up a good deal—one en' of her was;but dey warn't no great harm done, on'y our traps was mos' all los'. Ef we hadn' dive' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn't ben so dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin' is, we'd a seed de raf'. But it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase now she's all fixed up ag'in mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o' stuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'.”

“Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim—did you catch her?”

“How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? No; some er de niggers foun' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben', en dey hid her in a crick 'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin' 'bout which un 'um she b'long to de mos' dat I come to heah 'bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de trouble by tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv 'um, but to you en me; en I ast'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman's propaty, en git a hid'n for it? Den I gin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey 'uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en make 'm rich ag'in. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever I wants 'm to do fur me I doan' have to ast 'm twice, honey. Dat Jack's a good nigger, en pooty smart.”

“Yes, he is. He ain't ever told me you was here; told me to come, and he'd show me a lot of water moccasins. If anything happens he ain't mixed up in it. He can say he never seen us together, and it'll be the truth.”

I don't want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I'll cut it pretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was—didn't seem to be anybody stirring. That warn't usual. Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes downstairs—nobody around; everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside. Thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the woodpile I comes across my Jack, and says:

“What's it all about?”

Says he:

“Don't you know, Mars Jawge?”

“No,” says I, “I don't.”

“Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has. She run off in de night some time—nobody don't know jis' when; run off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know—leastways, so dey 'spec. De fambly foun' it out, 'bout half an hour ago—maybe a little mo'—en I tell you dey warn't no time los'. Sich another hurryin' up guns en hosses you never see! De women folks has gone for to stir up the relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him 'fo' he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck'n dey's gwyne to be mighty rough times.”

“Buck went off 'thout waking me up.”

“Well I reck'n he did! Dey warn't gwyne to mix you up in it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en 'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah, I reck'n, en you bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst.”

I took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. When I came in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn't.

There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing; but they couldn't come it. Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at. The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they could watch both ways.

By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run. They got half-way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them. They gained on the boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old.

The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He was awful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or other—wouldn't be gone long. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn't come down. Buck began to cry and rip, and 'lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap) would make up for this day yet. He said his father and his two brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations—the Shepherdsons was too strong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He said they'd got across the river and was safe. I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain't ever heard anything like it.

All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns—the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain't agoing to tell all that happened—it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I ain't ever going to get shut of them—lots of times I dream about them.

I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down. Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would 'a' locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn't ever happened.

When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the riverbank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.

It was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn't on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn't get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me, says:

“Good lan'! is dat you, honey? Doan' make no noise.”

It was Jim's voice—nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says:

“Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you's dead ag'in. Jack's been heah; he say he reck'n you's ben shot, kase you didn' come home no mo'; so I's jes' dis minute a-startin' de raf' down towards de mouf er de crick, so's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes ag'in en tells me for certain you is dead. Lawsy, I's mighty glad to git you back ag'in, honey.”

I says:

“All right—that's mighty good; they won't find me, and they'll think I've been killed, and floated down the river—there's something up there that'll help them to think so—so don't you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.”

I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens—there ain't nothing in the world so good, when it's cooked right—and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time. I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp. We said there warn't no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.





Chapter XIX


Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we put in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there—sometimes a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up—nearly always in the dead water under a tow-head; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres—perfactly still—just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line—that was the woods on t'other side; you couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away—trading scows, and such things; and long black streaks—rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or jumbled-up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a log cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way, because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the songbirds just going it!

A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up stream, so far off towards the other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see—just solid lonesomeness. Next you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the ax flash and come down—you don't hear nothing;you see that ax go up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the k'chunk! —it had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing—heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:

“No; spirits wouldn't say, ‘Dern the dern fog.'”

Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked about all kinds of things—we was always naked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes would let us—the new clothes Buck's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on clothes, nohow.

Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water;and maybe a spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened;I judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could 'a' laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.

Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.

After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three hours the shores was black—no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparks was our clock—the first one that showed again meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up, right away.

One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore—it was only two hundred yards—and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn't get some berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cow-path crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was me—or maybe Jim. I was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives—said they hadn't been doing nothing, and was being chased for it—said there was men and dogs a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:

“Don't you do it. I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in—that'll throw the dogs off the scent.”

They done it, and as soon as they was aboard I lit out for our tow-head, and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off, shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn't see them; they seemed to stop and fool around awhile; then, as we got further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the tow-head and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe.

One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head and very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woolen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot tops, and home-knit galluses—no, he only had one. He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpetbags.

The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out was that these chaps didn't know one another.

“What got you into trouble?” says the baldhead to t'other chap.

“Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth—and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel with it—but I staid about one night longer than I ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get off. So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would scatter out with you. That's the whole yarn—what's yourn?”

“Well, I'd been a-runnin'a little temperance revival thar 'bout a week, and was the pet of the womenfolks, big and little, for I was makin' it mighty warm for the rummies, I tell you, and takin' as much as five or six dollars a night—ten cents a head, children and niggers free—and business a growin' all the time; when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin'in my time with a private jug on the sly. A nigger rousted me out this mornin', and told me the people was getherin' on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and they'd be along pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour's start, and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn't wait for no breakfast—I warn't hungry.”

“Old man,” said the young one, “I reckon we might double-team it together; what do you think?”

“I ain't undisposed. What's your line—mainly?”

“Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines; theater-actor—tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there's a chance; teach singing-geography school for a change;sling a lecture sometimes—oh, I do lots of things—most anything that comes handy, so it ain't work. What's your lay?”

“I've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. Layin' on o' hands is my best holt—for cancer and paralysis, and sich things; and I k'n tell a fortune pretty good when I've got somebody along to find out the facts for me. Preachin's my line, too; and workin' campmeetin's, and missionaryin' around.”

Nobody never said anything for awhile; then the young man hove a sigh and says:

“Alas!”

“What're you alassin' about?” says the baldhead.

“To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be degraded down into such company.” And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag.

“Dern your skin, ain't the company good enough for you?” says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.

“Yes, it is good enough for me; it's as good as I deserve; for who fetched me so low when I was so high? I did myself. I don't blame you, gentlemen—far from it; I don't blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know—there's a grave somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it's always done, and take everything from me—loved ones, property, everything; but it can't take that. Some day I'll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest.” He went on a-wiping.

“Drot your pore broken heart,” says the baldhead; “What are you heaving your pore broken heart at us f'r? We hain't done nothing.”

“No, I know you haven't. I ain't blaming you, gentlemen. I brought myself down—yes, I did it myself. It's right I should suffer—perfectly right—I don't make any moan.”

“Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?”

“Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes—let it pass—'tis no matter. The secret of my birth—”

“The secret of your birth? Do you mean to say—”

“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights I am a duke!”

Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did, too. Then the baldhead says: “No! you can't mean it?”

“Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the same time. The second son of the late duke seized the title and estates—the infant real duke was ignored. I am the lineal descendant of that infant—I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heartbroken, and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!”

Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or“My Lord,” or “Your Lordship”—and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain “Bridgewater,” which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.

Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo' Grace have some o'dis or some o'dat?” and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him.

But the old man got pretty silent by and by—didn't have much to say, and didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke. He seemed to have something on his mind. So, along in the afternoon, he says:

“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I'm nation sorry for you, but you ain't the only person that's had troubles like that.”

“No?”

“No, you ain't. You ain't the only person that's ben snaked down wrongfully out'n a high place.”

“Alas!”

“No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth.” And by jings, he begins to cry.

“Hold! What do you mean?”

“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of sobbing.

“To the bitter death!” He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it, and says, “The secret of your being: speak!”

“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”

You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says:

“You are what?”

“Yes, my friend, it is too true—your eyes is lookin' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.”

“You! At your age! No! You mean you're the late Charlemagne;you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.”

“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled, trampled-on and sufferin' rightful King of France.”

Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to do, we was so sorry—and so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort him. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for awhile if people treated him according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him “Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of soured on him, and didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by his father, and was allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the king says:

“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time, on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what's the use o' your bein' sour? It'll only make things oncomfortable. It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke, it ain't your fault you warn't born a king—so what's the use to worry? Make the best things the way you find 'em, says I—that's my motto. This ain't no bad thing that we've struck here—plenty grub and an easy life—come, give us your hand, duke, and le's all be friends.”

The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it would 'a' been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.

It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble. If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as it would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so I didn't tell him. If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way.





Chapter XX


They asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running—was Jim a runaway nigger? Says I:

“Goodness sakes, would a runaway nigger run south?”

No, they allowed he wouldn't. I had to account for things some way, so I says:

“My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he 'lowed he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little one-horse place on the river forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way. Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it. Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger. We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't bother us.”

The duke says:

“Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to. I'll think the thing over—I'll invent a plan that'll fix it. We'll let it alone for today, because of course we don't want to go by that town yonder in daylight—it mightn't be healthy.”

Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to shiver—it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that. So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick—better than Jim's, which was a cornshuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves;it makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed he would take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't. He says:

“I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn shuck bed warn't just fitten for me to sleep on. Your Grace'll take the shuck bed yourself.”

Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke says:

“'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit; 'tis my fate. I am alone in the world—let me suffer; I can bear it.”

We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by—That was the town, you know—and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't 'a' turned in anyway if I'd had a bed, because a body don't see such a storm as that every night in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a h-wack! —bum! bum! bumble-umble-umbum-bum-bum-bum—and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit—and then rip comes another flash and another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind. We didn't have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.

I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always mighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for me; so I laid outside—I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn't running so high now. About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm;but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim a-laughing. He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.

I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin light that showed I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day.

The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and the duke played seven-up awhile, five cents a game. Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would “Lay out a campaign,” as they called it. The duke went down into his carpetbag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said, “The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would “Lecture on the Science of Phrenology” at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece.” The duke said that was him. In another bill he was the “world renowned Shaksperean tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London.” In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a “divining-rod,”“dissipating witch spells,” and so on. By and by he says:

“But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod the boards, Royalty?”

“No,” says the king.

“You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur,” says the duke. “The first good town we come to we'll hire a hall to do the swordfight in ‘Richard III', and the balcony scene in ‘Romeo and Juliet'. How does that strike you?”

“I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you see, I don't know nothing about play-actn', and hain't ever seen much of it. I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace. Do you reckon you can learn me?”

“Easy!”

“All right. I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway. Le's commence right away.”

So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.

“But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.”

“No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that. Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she's got on her nightgown and her ruffled nightcap. Here are the costumes for the parts.”

He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil armor for Richard III and t'other chap, and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. The king was satisfied;so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart.

There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed he would go, too. and see if he couldn't strike something. We was out of coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.

When we got there, there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp meeting, about two mile back in the woods. The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that camp meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.

The duke said what he was after was a printing office. We found it; a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop—carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty, littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke shed his coat and said he was all right now. So me and the king lit out for the camp meeting.

We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched everywheres, feeding out of the wagon troughs and stomping to keep off the flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.

The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs. They didn't have no backs. The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on sunbonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was barefooted, and some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks was courting on the sly.

The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way;then he lined out two more for them to sing—and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other, and then a—leaning down over the front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, “It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!” And people would shout out, “Glory! —A-a-men!” And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:

“Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (amen! ) come, sick and sore! (amen! ) come, lame and halt and blind! (amen! ) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (a-a-men! ) come, all that's worn, and soiled and suffering! —come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open—oh, enter in and be at rest!” (a-a-men! glory, glory hallelujah! )

And so on. You couldn't make out what the preacher said, any more, on account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.

Well, the first I knowed, the king got a-going, and you could hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up onto the platform, and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He told them he was a pirate—been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean—and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for the first time in his life; and poor as he was, he was going to start right off and, work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all the pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him, “Don't you thank me, don't you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville campmeeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”

And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!” Well, a half dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, “Let him pass the hat around!” Then everybody said it, the preacher too.

So the king went all through the crowd with his hat, swabbing his eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times—and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the camp meeting he couldn't do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.

When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when we was starting home through the woods. The king said, take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in the missionarying line. He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't amount to shucks, alongside of pirates to work a camp meeting with.

The duke was thinking he'd been doing pretty well till the king come to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office—horse bills—and took the money, four dollars. And he had got in ten dollars worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance—so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cord—wood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head—three verses—kind of sweet and saddish—the name of it was,“Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart”—and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it.

Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward” under it. The reading was all about Jim and just described him to a dot. It said he run away from St. Jacques's plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses.

“Now,” says the duke, “after tonight we can run in the daytime if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing—we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.”

We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no trouble about running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we could boom right along if we wanted to.

We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.

When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:

“Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo' kings on dis trip?”

“No,” I says, “I reckon not.”

“Well,” says he, “dat's all right, den. I doan' mine one er two kings, but dat's enough. Dis one's powerful drunk, en de duke ain' much better.”

I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and had so much trouble, he'd forgot it.





Chapter XXI


It was after sunup now, but we went right on and didn't tie up. The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but after they'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on a corner of the raft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his legs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and went to getting his “Romeo and Juliet” by heart. When he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practise it together. The duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after awhile he said he done it pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn't bellow out Romeo! that way, like a bull—you must say it soft and sick and languishy, so—R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet's a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and she doesn't bray like a jackass.”

Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths, and begun to practise the swordfight—the duke called himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see. But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard, and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they'd had in other times along the river.

After dinner the duke says:

“Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-class show, you know, so I guess we'll add a little more to it. We want a little something to answer encores with, anyway.”

“What's onkores, Bilgewater?”

The duke told him, and then says:

“I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor's hornpipe;and you—well, let me see—oh, I've got it—you can do Hamlet's soliloquy.”

“Hamlet's which?”

“Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare. Ah, it's sublime, sublime! Always fetches the house. I haven't got it in the book—I've only got one volume—but I reckon I can piece it out from memory. I'll just walk up and down a minute, and see if I can call it back from recollection's vaults.”

So he went to marching up and down, thinking, and frowning horrible every now and then; then he would hoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan; next he would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop a tear. It was beautiful to see him. By and by he got it. He told us to give attention. Then he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before. This is the speech—I learned it, easy enough, while he was learning it to the king:





To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin

That makes calamity of so long life;

For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,

But that the fear of something after death

Murders the innocent sleep,

Great nature's second course,

And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune

Than fly to others that we know not of.

There's the respect must give us pause:

Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst;

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,

The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,

The law's delay, and the quietus which his pangs might take,

In the dead waste and middle of the night, when churchyards yawn

In customary suits of solemn black,

But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns,

Breathes forth contagion on the world,

And thus the native hue of resolution, like the poor cat i' the adage,

Is sicklied o'er with care,

And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops,

With this regard their currents turn awry,

And lose the name of action.

’Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.

But soft you, the fair Ophelia:

Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws,

But get thee to a nunnery—go!





Well, the old man he liked that speech, and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first rate. It seemed like he was just born for it; and when he had his hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off.

The first chance we got, the duke he had some show bills printed;and after that, for two or three days as we floated along, the raft was a most uncommon lively place, for there warn't nothing but sword-fighting and rehearsing—as the duke called it—going on all the time. One morning, when we was pretty well down the state of Arkansaw, we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees, and all of us but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show.

We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon, and the countrypeople was already beginning to come in, in all kinds of old shackly wagons, and on horses. The circus would leave before night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he hired the courthouse, and we went around and stuck up our bills. They read like this:

Then we went loafing around town. The stores and houses was most all old, shackly, dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash piles, and old curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tinware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at different times; and they leaned every which way, and had gates that didn't generly have but one hinge—a leather one. Some of the fences had been whitewashed some time or another, but the duke said it was in Clumbus's time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.

All the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings in front, and the countrypeople hitched their horses to the awning posts. There was empty dry-goods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching—a mighty ornery lot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn't wear no coats nor waistcoats;they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss-words. There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning post, and he most always had his hands in his britches pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was:

“Gimme a chaw'v tobacker, Hank.”

“Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.”

Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain't got none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by borrowing; they say to a fellow, “I wisht you'd len' me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”—which is a lie pretty much every time; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; but Jack ain't no stranger, so he says:

“You give him a chaw, did you? so did your sister's cat's grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you've awready borry'd off'n me, Lafe Buckner, then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won't charge you no back intrust, nuther.”

“Well, I did pay you back some of it wunst.”

“Yes, you did—'bout six chaws. You borry'd store tobacker and paid back niggerhead.”

Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don't generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two;then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it's handed back, and says, sarcastic:

“Here, gimme the chaw, and you take the plug.”

All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn't nothing else but mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places; and two or three inches deep in all the places. The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres. You'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out, “Hi! so boy! sick him, Tige!” and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. Then they'd settle back again till there was a dogfight. There couldn't anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all over, like a dogfight—unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin to his tail and see him run himself to death.

On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving back, and back, and back, because the river's always gnawing at it.

The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. Families fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them in the wagons. There was considerable whiskey drinking going on, and I seen three fights. By and by somebody sings out:

“Here comes old Boggs! —in from the country for his little old monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!”

All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs. One of them says:

“Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time. If he'd a-chawed up all the men he's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he'd have considerable reputation now.”

Another one says, “I wisht old Boggs'd threaten me, 'cuz then I'd know I warn't gwyne to die for a thousan' year.”

Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whopping and yelling like an Injun, and singing out:

“Cler the track, thar. I'm on the waw-path, and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise.”

He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old, and had a very red face. Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn't wait now because he'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was, “Meat first and spoon vittles to top off on.”

He see me, and rode up and says:

“Whar'd you come f'm, boy? You prepared to die?”

Then he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:

”He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin'on like that when he's drunk. He's the best-naturedest old fool in Arkansaw—never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober.”

Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells: “Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you've swindled. You're the houn' I'm after, and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!”

And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to, and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on. By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five—and he was a heap the best-dressed man in that town, too—steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. He says to Boggs, mighty ca'm and slow—he says:

“I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock. Till one o'clock, mind—no longer. If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you can't travel so far but I will find you.”

Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober;nobody stirred, and there warn't no more laughing. Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up. Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes, and so he must go home—he must go right away. But it didn't do no good. He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use—up the street he would tear again, and give Sherburn another cussing. By and by somebody says:

“Go for his daughter! —quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he'll listen to her. If anybody can persuade him, she can.”

So somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways and stopped. In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on his horse. He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bareheaded, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself. Somebody sings out:

“Boggs!”

I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn. He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in his right hand—not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky. The same second I see a young girl coming on the run, and two men with her. Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side, and the pistol barrel come down slow and steady to a level—both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both hands and says, “O Lord, don't shoot!” Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers back, clawing at the air—bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles backwards onto the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out. That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, “Oh, he's killed him, he's killed him!” The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting: “Back, back! give him air, give him air!”

Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol onto the ground, and turned around on his heels and walked off.

They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. He made about a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it out—and after that he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter away from him, screaming and crying, and took her off. She was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.

Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was saying all the time, “Say, now, you've looked enough, you fellows; 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as you.

There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there was going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching their necks and listening. One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stopping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, “Boggs!” and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says“Bang!” staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and fell down flat on his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was just exactly the way it all happened. Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him.

Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes line they come to to do the hanging with.





Chapter XXII


They swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, a-whooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence;and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death.

They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together, and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise. It was a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out “Tear down the fence! tear down the fence!” Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.

Just then Sherburn steps out onto the roof of his little front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca'm and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the wave sucked back.

Sherburn never said a word—just stood there, looking down. The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. Sherburn run his eyes slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand in it.

Then he says, slow and scornful:

“The idea of you lynching anybody! It's amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man! Because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a man? Why, a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind—as long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.

“Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and raised in the South, and I've lived in the North; so I know the average all around. The average man's a coward. In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man, all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people—whereas you're just as brave, and no braver. Why don't your juries hang murderers? Because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark—and it's just what they would do.

“So they always acquit; and then a man goes in the night, with a hundred masked cowards at his back, and lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that you didn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, and the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks. You brought part of a man—Buck Harkness, there—and if you hadn't had him to start you, you'd 'a' taken it out in blowing.

“You didn't want to come. The average man don't like trouble and danger. You don't like trouble and danger. But if only half a man—like Buck Harkness, there—shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him! ' you're afraid to back down—afraid you'll be found out to be what you are—cowards—and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves onto that half-a-man's coattail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is—a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness. Now the thing for you to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll bring their masks, and fetch a man along. Now leave—and take your half-a-man with you”—tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this.

The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap. I could 'a' stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.

I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by, and then dived in under the tent. I had a twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from home and amongst strangers that way. You can't be too careful. I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but there ain't no use in wasting it on them.

It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, and gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable—there must 'a' been twenty of them—and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, and their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent roof, and every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.

And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the centrepole, cracking his whip and shouting “Hi! —hi!” and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves. And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.

Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things;and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever could think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't no way understand. Why, I couldn't 'a' thought of them in a year. And by and by a drunken man tried to get into the ring—said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm toward the ring, saying, “Knock him down! throw him out!” and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride, if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunken man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire, too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his life—and then he began to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum—and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressingroom, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.

Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he was the sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough, to be took in so, but I wouldn't 'a' been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars. I don't know;there may be bullier circuses than what that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good enough for me; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of my custom every time.

Well, that night we had our show; but there warn't only about twelve people there—just enough to pay expenses. And they laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy—and may-be something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could size their style. So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village. The bills said:





AT THE COURT HOUSE!

For 3 Nights Only!





The World-Renowned Tragedians

DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!

and

EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!

Of the London and Continental Theatres, In their Thrilling Tragedy of

THE KING'S CAMELEOPARD,

or

THE ROYAL NONESUCH! ! !

Admission 50 cents.





Then at the bottom was the biggest line of all, which said:





LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED





“There,” says he, “If that line don't fetch them, I don't know Arkansaw!”





Chapter XXIII


Well, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn't hold no more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come onto the stage and stood up before the curtain, and made a little speech, and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it; and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king comes a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over, ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow. And—but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild, but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over agin, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.

Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold aready for it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it.

Twenty people sings out:

“What, is it over? Is that all?”

The duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings out, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was agoing for that stage and them tragedians. But a big, fine-looking man jumps up on a bench, and shouts:

“Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen.” They stopped to listen. “We are sold—mighty badly sold. But we don't want to be the laughing-stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live. No what we want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the rest of the town! Then we'll all be in the same boat. Ain't that sensible?” (“You bet it is! —the jedge is right!” everybody sings out.) “All right, then—not a word about any sell. Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy.”

Next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this crowd the same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town.

The third night the house was crammed again—and they warn't newcomers this time, but people that was at the show the other two nights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his coat—and I see it warn't no perfumery neither, not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things;and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do, there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn't stand it. Well, when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says:

“Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you!”

I done it, and he done the same. We struck the raft at the same time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding downstream, all dark and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:

“Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time, Duke?”

He hadn't been up town at all.

We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they'd served them people. The duke says:

“Greenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us the third night, and consider it was their turn now. Well, it is their turn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it. I would just like to know how they're putting in their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic if they want to—they brought plenty provisions.”

Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see money hauled in by the wagonload like that before.

By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jim says:

“Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on, Huck?”

“No,” I says, “it don't.”

“Why don't it, Huck?”

“Well, it don't, because it's in the breed. I reckon they're all alike.”

“But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions; dat's jist what dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions.”

“Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings is mostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out.”

“Is dat so?”

“You read about them once—you'll see. Look at Henry the Eight;this'n's a Sunday-School Superintendent to him. And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom. He was a blossom. He used to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. ‘fetch up Nell Gwynn, ' he says. They fetch her up. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head! ' And they chop it off. ‘Fetch up Jane Shore, ' he says; and up she comes. Next morning ‘Chop off her head'—and they chop it off. ‘Ring up Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning, ‘Chop off her head.' And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You don't know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does he go at it—give notice? —give the country a show? No. All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on. That was his style—he never give anybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a butt of mamsey, like a cat. S'pose people left money laying around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S'pose he contracted to do a thing; and you paid him, and didn't set down there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done the other thing. S'pose he opened his mouth—what then? If he didn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie every time. That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we'd 'a' had him along 'stead of our kings he'd 'a' fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't say that ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you come right down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing to that old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all around, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the way they're raised.”

“But dis one do smell so like de nation, Huck.”

“Well, they all do, Jim. We can't help the way a king smells; history don't tell no way.”

“Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in some ways.”

“Yes, a duke's different. But not very different. This one's a middling hard lot for a duke. When he's drunk there ain't no near-sighted man could tell him from a king.”

“Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um, Huck. Dese is all I kin stan'.”

“It's the way I feel, too, Jim. But we've got them on our hands, and we got to remember what they are, and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that's out of kings.”

What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kings and dukes? It wouldn't 'a' done no good; and, besides, it was just as I said; you couldn't tell them from the real kind.

I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it was my turn. He often done that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was setting there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to himself. I didn't take notice, nor let on. I knowed what it was about. He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n. It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so. He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, “Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it's mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!” He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.

But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones; and by and by he says:

“What makes me feel so bad dis time, 'uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I treat my little 'Lizabeth so ornery. She warn't on'y 'bout fo' year ole en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever, en had a powful rough spell;but she got well, en one day she was a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, I says:

“‘shet de do'.’

“She never done it; jis'stood dah, kiner smilin' up at me. It make me mad; en I says ag'in, mighty loud, I says:

“‘Doan' you hear me? Shet de do'! ’

“She jis' stood de same way, kiner smilin'ap. I was a-bilin'! I says:

“‘I lay I make you mine! ’

“En wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin'.Den I went into de yuther room, en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes; en when I come back dah was dat do' a-stannin' open yit, en dat chile stannin' mos' right in it, a-lookin' down and mournin', en de tears runnin' down. My, but I wuz mad! I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis' den—it was a do' dat open innerds—jis' den, 'long come de wind en slam it to, behine de chile, ker-blam! —en my lan', de chile never move'! My breff mos' hop outer me; en I feel so—so—I doan' know how I feel. I crope out, all a-tremblin', en crope aroun' en open de do' easy en slow, en poke my head in behine de chile, sof' en still, en all uv a sudden I says pow! jis' as loud as I could yell. She never budge! Oh, Huck, I bust out a-cryin' en grab her up in my arms, en say, ‘Oh, de po' little thing! De Lord God Amighty fogive po' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive hisself as long's he live! ' Oh, she was plumb deef en dumb, Huck, plumb deef en dumb—en I'd ben a-treat'n her so!”





Chapter XXIV


Next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.

He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit—it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horsehair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theaterpaint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead, dull solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn't the horriblest-looking outrage I ever see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:





Sick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head





And he nailed the shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.

These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the news might 'a' worked along down by this time. They couldn't hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way—meaning the devil, I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. I done it, of course. The king's duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body before. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about three mile above town—been there a couple of hours, taking on freight. Says the king:

“Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll come down to the village on her.”

I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a couple of big carpetbags by him.

“Run her nose inshore,” says the king. I done it. “Wher' you bound for, young man?”

“For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”

“Git aboard,” says the king. “Hold on a minute, my servant'll he'p you with them bags. Jump out and he'p the gentleman, Adolphus”—meaning me, I see.

I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The young fellow says:

“When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.' But then I says again, ‘No, I reckon it ain't him, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.' You ain't him, are you?”

“No, my name's Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—Reverend Elexander Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, as I'm one o' the Lord's poor servants. But still I'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it—which I hope he hasn't.”

“Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die—which he mayn't mind, nobody can tell as to that—but his brother would 'a' give anything in this world to see him before he died; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was boys together—and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all—that's the deef and dumb one—William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and his wife both died last year. Harvey and William's the only ones that's left now; and, as I was saying, they haven't got here in time.”

“Did anybody send 'em word?”

“Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the redheaded one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see Harvey—and William, too, for that matter—because he was one of them kind that can't bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and said he'd told in it where his money was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George's g'yirls would be all right—for George didn't leave nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.”

“Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? Wher' does he live?”

“Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—preaches there—hasn't ever been in this country. He hasn't had any too much time—and besides he mightn't 'a' got the letter at all, you know.”

“Too bad, too bad he couldn't 'a' lived to see his brothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?”

“Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. I'm going in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”

“It's a pretty long journey. But it'll be lovely; I wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?”

“Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna's about fourteen—that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip.”

“Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”

“Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain't going to let them come to no harm. There's Hobson, the Babtis' preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and—well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey'll know where to look for friends when he gets here.”

Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow. Blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and about Peter's business—which was a tanner; and about George's—which was a carpenter; and about Harvey's—which was a dissentering minister; and so on, and so on. Then he says:

“What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”

“Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop there. When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.”

“Was Peter Wilks well off?”

“Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers.”

“When did you say he died?”

“I didn't say, but it was last night.”

“Funeral tomorrow, likely?”

“Yes, 'bout the middle of the day.”

“Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all right.”

“Yes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to always say that.”

When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore, and says:

“Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new carpetbags. And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.”

I see what he was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had said it—every last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good. Then he says:

“How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”

The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histrionic boards. So then they waited for a steamboat.

About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and said they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm. He says:

“If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?”

So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a coming; and when the king says:

“Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?” they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say, “What d' I tell you?” Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:

“I'm sorry, sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live yesterday evening.”

Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went all to smash, and fell up against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, and says:

“Alas, alas, our poor brother—gone, and we never got to see him;oh, it's too, too hard!”

Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpetbag and bust out a-crying. If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, that ever I struck.

Well, the men gethered around and sympathized with them, and said all sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpetbags up the hill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they'd lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I struck anything like it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race.





Chapter XXV


The news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldiermarch. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence:

“Is it them?”

And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:

“You bet it is.”

When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane was redheaded, but that don't make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for them, and the harelip jumped for the duke, and there they had it! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times.

Then the king he hunched the duke private—I see him do it—and then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other's shoulder, and t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping, people saying “Sh!” and all the men taking their hats off and dropping their heads, so you could 'a' heard a pin fall. And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could 'a' heard them to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other's neck, and hung their chins over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t'other on t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to theirselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud—the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.

Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle, about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile, but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother's heart, because out of their mouths they can't, words being too weak and cold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust.

And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxologer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash, I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.

Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters, and so he will name the same, towit, as follows, viz.; —Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.

Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town, a-hunting together—that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him; and then they shook hands with the duke, and didn't say nothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said“Goo-goo-goo-goo-goo,” all the time, like a baby that can't talk.

So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George's family, or to Peter; and he always let on that Peter wrote him the things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.

Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling house and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar. So these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up, and have everything square and aboveboard; and told me to come with a candle. We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them yaller-boys. My, the way the king's eyes did shine! He slaps the duke on the shoulder and says:

“Oh, this ain't bully nor noth'n! Oh, no, I reckon not! Why, Biljy, it beats the Nonesuch, don't it!”

The duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king says:

“It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and me, Bilge. Thish yer comes of trust'n to Providence. It's the best way, in the long run. I've tried 'em all, and there ain't no better way.”

Most everybody would 'a' been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust; but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:

“Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars?”

They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then the duke says:

“Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake—I reckon that's the way of it. The best way's to let it go, and keep still about it. We can spare it.”

“Oh, shucks, yes, we can spare it. I don't k'yer noth'n 'bout that—it's the count I'm thinkin'about. We want to be awful square and open and aboveboard here, you know. We want to lug this h'yer money upstairs and count it before everybody—then ther' ain't noth'n suspicious. But when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars, you know, we don't want to—”

“Hold on,” says the duke. “Less make up the deffisit”—and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.

“It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke—you have got a rattlin' clever head on you,” says the king. “Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a heppin' us out ag'in.” and he begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up.

It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.

“Say,” says the duke, “I got another idea. Le's go upstairs and count this money, and then take and give it to the girls.”

“Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a man struck. You have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head I ever see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it. Let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to—this'll lay 'em out.”

When we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile—twenty elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked their chops. Then they raked it into the bag agin, and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech. He says:

“Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that's left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by theseyer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's left fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he would 'a' done more generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his dear William and me. Now, wouldn't he? Ther' ain't no question 'bout it in my mind. Well, then, what kind o' brothers would it be, that'd stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o' uncles would it be that'd rob—yes, rob—sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a time? If I know William—and I think I do—he—well, I'll jest ask him.” He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with hands; and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed awhile; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. Then the king says, “I knowed it;I reckon that'll convince anybody the way he feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money—take it all. It's the gift of him that lays yonder, cold but joyful.”

Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the harelip went for the duke, and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of them frauds, saying all the time:

“You dear good souls! —how lovely! —how could you!”

Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that;and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything;and nobody saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy listening. The king was saying—in the middle of something he'd started in on:

“—they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased. That's why they're invited here this evenin'; but tomorrow we want all to come—everybody; for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it's fitten that his funeral orgies sh'd be public.”

And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he couldn't stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,“Obsequies, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people's heads to him. The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and says:

“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his heart's aluz right. Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral—wants me to make 'em all welcome. But he needn't 'a' worried—it was jest what I was at.”

Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before. And when he done it the third time he says:

“I say orgies, not because it's the common term, because it ain't—obsequies bein' the common term—but because orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain't used in England no more now—it's gone out. We say orgies now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing you're after more exact. It's a word that's made up out'n the Greek orgo, outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew jeesum, to plant, cover up; hence inter. So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public funeral.”

He was the worst I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says,“Why, doctor!” and Abner Shackleford says:

“Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks.”

The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:

“Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician? I—”

“Keep your hands off of me!” says the doctor. “You talk like an Englishman, don't you? It's the worst imitation I ever heard. You Peter Wilks's brother. You're a fraud, that's what you are!”

Well, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey'd showed in forty ways that he was Harvey, and knowed everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and begged him not to hurt Harvey's feelings and the poor girls' feelings, and all that; But it warn't no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar. The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them. He says:

“I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend; and I warn you as a friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor—has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he has picked up somewheres, and you take them for proofs, and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know better. Mary Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out—I beg you to do it. Will you?”

Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She says:

“Here is my answer.” She hove up the bag of money and put it in the king's hands, and says, “Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to, and don't give us no receipt for it.”

Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the harelip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his hand and smiled proud. The doctor says:

“All right; I wash my hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a time's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day.” and away he went.

“All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him; “We'll try and get 'em to send for you”; which made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good hit.





Chapter XXVI


Well, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for Uncle William, and she'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it. The king said the cubby would do for his valley—meaning me.

So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain but nice. She said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but he said they warn't. The frocks was hung along the wall, and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor. There was an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar box in another, and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room with. The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings, and so don't disturb them. The duke's room was pretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was my cubby.

That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there, and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them, and the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head of the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was—and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said so—said “How do you get biscuits to brown so nice?” and “Where, for the land's sake, did you get these amaz'n pickles?” and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know.

And when it was all done me and the harelip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things. The harelip she got to pumping me about England, and blest if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She says:

“Did you ever see the king?”

“Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have—he goes to our church.”I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he goes to our church, she says:

“What—regular?”

“Yes—regular. His pew's right over opposite ourn—on t'other side the pulpit.”

“I thought he lived in London?”

“Well, he does. Where would he live?”

“But I thought you lived in Sheffield?”

I see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:

“I mean he goes to our church regular when he's in Sheffield. That's only in the summertime, when he comes there to take the sea baths.”

“Why, how you talk—Sheffield ain't on the sea.”

“Well, who said it was?”

“Why, you did.”

“I didn't, nuther.”

“You did!”

“I didn't.”

“You did.”

“I never said nothing of the kind.”

“Well, what did you say, then?”

“Said he come to take the sea baths—that's what I said.”

“Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the sea?”

“Looky here,” I says; “Did you ever see any Congress-water?”

“Yes.”

“Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”

“Why, no.”

“Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath.”

“How does he get it, then?”

“Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water—in barrels. There in the palace at Sheffield they've got furnaces, and he wants his water hot. They can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven't got no conveniences for it.”

“Oh, I see, now. You might 'a' said that in the first place and saved time.”

When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was comfortable and glad. Next, she says:

“Do you go to church, too?”

“Yes—regular.”

“Where do you set?”

“Why, in our pew.”

“Whose pew?”

“Why, ourn—your Uncle Harvey's.”

“His'n? What does he want with a pew?”

“Wants it to set in. What did you reckon he wanted with it?”

“Why, I thought he'd be in the pulpit.”

Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again, so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:

“Blame it, do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church?”

“Why, what do they want with more?”

“What! —to preach before a king? I never did see such a girl as you. They don't have no less than seventeen.”

“Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn't set out such a string as that, not if I never got to glory. It must take 'em a week.”

“Shucks, they don't all of 'em preach the same day—only one of 'em.”

“Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?”

“Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate—and one thing or another. But mainly they don't do nothing.”

“Well, then, what are they for?”

“Why, they're for style. Don't you know nothing?”

“Well, I don't want to know no such foolishness as that. How is servants treated in England? Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers?”

“No! A servant ain't nobody there. They treat them worse than dogs.”

“Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do, Christmas and New Year's week, and Fourth of July?”

“Oh, just listen! A body could tell you hain't ever been to England by that. Why, Hare-l—why, Joanna, they never see a holiday from year's end to year's end; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.”

“Nor church?”

“Nor church.”

“But you always went to church.”

Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man's servant. But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant, and had to go to church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of it's being the law. But I didn't do it pretty good, and when I got done I see she warn't satisfied. She says:

“Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me a lot of lies?”

“Honest injun,” says I.

“None of it at all?”

“None of it at all. Not a lie in it,” says I.

“Lay your hand on this book and say it.”

I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it and said it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:

“Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious if I'll believe the rest.”

“What is it you won't believe, Jo?” says Mary Jane, stepping in with Susan behind her. “It ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him, and him a stranger and so far from his people. How would you like to be treated so?”

“That's always your way, Maim—always sailing in to help somebody before they're hurt. I hain't done nothing to him. He's told some stretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's every bit and grain I did say. I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can't he?”

“I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big; he's here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn't good of you to say it. If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn't to say a thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed.”

“Why, Maim, he said—”

“It don't make no difference what he said—that ain't the thing. The thing is for you to treat him kind, and not be saying things to make him remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks.”

I says to myself, this is a girl that I'm letting that old reptle rob her of her money!

Then Susan she waltzed in; and if you'll believe me, she did give Harelip hark from the tomb!

Says I to myself, And this is another one that I'm letting him rob her of her money!

Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again—which was her way; but when she got done there warn't hardly anything left o' poor Harelip. So she hollered.

“All right, then,” says the other girls, “You just ask his pardon.”

She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do it again.

I says to myself, this is another one that I'm letting him rob her of her money. And when she got through, they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends. I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, My mind's made up; I'll hive that money for them or bust.

So then I lit out—for bed, I said, meaning some time or another. When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No—that won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No—I dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help, I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge. No; there ain't no good way but one. I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid. But I better hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.

So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do nothing without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judged I'd got to do the other thing—lay for them and eavesdrop. About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.

They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private. They sets down then, and the king says:

“Well, what is it? and cut it middlin' short, because it's better for us to be down there a-whooping up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a chance to talk us over.”

“Well, this is it, Capet. I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know your plans. I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one.”

“What is it, duke?”

“That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and clip it down the river with what we've got. Specially, seeing we got it so easy—given back to us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back. I'm for knocking off and lighting out.”

That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would 'a' been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed. The king rips out and says:

“What! And not sell out the rest o' the property? March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in? —and all good, salable stuff, too.”

The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn't want to go no deeper—didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they had.

“Why, how you talk!” says the king. “We sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money. The people that buys the property is the suff'rers; because as soon's it's found out 'at we didn't own it—which won't be long after we've slid—the sale won't be valid, and it'll all go back to the estate. These yer orphans'll git their house back agin, and that's enough for them; they're young and spry, and k'n easy earn a livin'. They ain't agoing to suffer. Why, jest think—there's thous'n's and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off. Bless you, they ain't got noth'n' to complain of.”

Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hanging over them. But the king says:

“Cuss the doctor! What do we k'yer for him? Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?”

So they got ready to go downstairs again. The duke says:

“I don't think we put that money in a good place.”

That cheered me up. I'd begun to think I warn't going to get a hint of no kind to help me. The king says:

“Why?”

“Because Mary Jane'll be in mourning from this out; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it?”

“Your head's level ag'in, duke,” says the king; and he come a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was. I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I tried to think what I'd better do if they did catch me. But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought, and he never suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the featherbed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now, because a nigger only makes up the featherbed, and don't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now.

But I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way downstairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking. I knowed that very well. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn't 'a' gone to sleep if I'd 'a' wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and waited to see if anything was going to happen. But nothing did.

So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.





Chapter XXVII


I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed along, and got downstairs all right. There warn't a sound anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open;but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man's face down in there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the moneybag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed, which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room and in behind the door.

The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me; so I looked through the crack, and everything was all right. They hadn't stirred.

I slipped up to bed, feeling rather blue, on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain't the thing that's going to happen; the thing that's going to happen is, the money'll be found when they come to screw on the lid. Then the king'll get it again, and it'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I wanted to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn't try it. Every minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir, and I might get catched—catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of. I don't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that, I says to myself.

When I got downstairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the watchers was gone. There warn't nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening, but I couldn't tell.

Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining room was full. I see the coffin lid was the way it was before, but I dasn't go to look in under it, with folks around.

Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses—because people always blow them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church.

When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham.

They had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along; the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you couldn't hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say, “Don't you worry—just depend on me.” Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders showing over the people's heads. So he glided along, and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “He had a rat!” Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked. There warn't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was.

Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screwdriver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I didn't know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I, s'pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly? —now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing's awful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business!

They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again—I couldn't help it, and I couldn't rest easy. But nothing come of it; the faces didn't tell me nothing.

The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't be done. And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too—tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.

Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off—sale two days after the funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.

So the next day after the funeral, along about noontime, the girls' joy got the first jolt. A couple of nigger-traders come along, and the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The girls said they hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town. I can't ever get it out of my memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn't 'a' stood it all, but would 'a' had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two.

The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy.

Next day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look that there was trouble. The king says:

“Was you in my room night before last?”

“No, your majesty”—which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang warn't around.

“Was you in there yesterday er last night?”

“No, your majesty.”

“Honor bright, now—no lies.”

“Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you the truth. I hain't been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you.”

The duke says:

“Have you seen anybody else go in there?”

“No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”

“Stop and think.”

I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:

“Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”

Both of them give a little jump, and looked like they hadn't ever expected it, and then like they had. Then the duke says:

“What, all of them?”

“No—leastways not all at once—that is, I don't think I ever see them all come out at once but just one time.”

“Hello! When was that?”

“It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It warn't early, because I overslept. I was just starting down the ladder, and I see them.”

“Well, go on, go on! What did they do? How'd they act?”

“They didn't do anything. And they didn't act anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in there to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up; and found you warn't up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up, if they hadn't already waked you up.”

“Great guns, this is a go!” says the king; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there a thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says:

“It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They let on to be sorry they was going out of this region! And I believed they was sorry. and so did you, and so did everybody. Don't ever tell me any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing it would fool anybody. In my opinion, there's a fortune in 'em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a better lay-out than that—and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song. Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where is that song—that draft.”

“In the bank for to be collected. Where would it be?”

“Well, that's all right then, thank goodness.”

Says I, kind of timid-like:

“Is something gone wrong?”

The king whirls on me and rips out:

“None o' your business! You keep your head shet, and mind y'r own affairs—if you got any. Long as you're in this town don't you forgit that—you hear?” Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it, and say noth'n': mum's the word for us.”

As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says:

“Quick sales and small profits! It's a good business—yes.”

The king snarls around on him and says:

“I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick. If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin' considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more'n it's yourn?”

“Well, they'd be in this house yet and we wouldn't if I could 'a' got my advice listened to.”

The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around and lit into me again. He give me down the banks for not coming and telling him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way—said any fool would 'a' knowed something was up. And then waltzed in and cussed himself awhile; and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I'd worked it all off onto the niggers, and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it.





Chapter XXVIII


By and by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and started for downstairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd been packing things in it—getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I went in there and says:

“Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can't—most always. Tell me about it.”

So she done it. And it was the niggers—I just expected it. She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn't know how she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no more—and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says:

“Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't ever going to see each other any more!”

“But they will—and inside of two weeks—and I know it!” says I.

Laws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again, say it again, say it again!

I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly safer than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:

“Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?”

“Yes; Mr. Lathrop's. Why?”

“Never mind why yet. If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again—inside of two weeks—here in this house—and prove how I know it—will you go to Mr. Lathrop's and stay four days?”

“Four days!” she says; “I'll stay a year!”

“All right,” I says, “I don't want nothing more out of you than just your word—I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible.” She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, “If you don't mind it, I'll shut the door—and bolt it.”

Then I come back and set down again, and says:

“Don't you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of frauds—regular dead-beats. There, now we're over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy.”

It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself onto the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times—and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says:

“The brute! Come—don't waste a minute—not a second—we'll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”

Says I:

“Cert'nly. But do you mean before you go to Mr. Lathrop's, or—”

“Oh,” she says, “what am I thinking about!” she says, and set right down again. “Don't mind what I said—please don't—you won't, now, will you?” Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first. “I never thought, I was so stirred up,” she says;“now go on, and I won't do so any more. You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I'll do it.”

“Well,” I says, “It's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm fixed so I got to travel with them awhile longer, whether I want to or not—I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble. Well, we got to save him, hain't we? Of course. Well, then, we won't blow on them.”

Saying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin working till pretty late tonight. I says:

“Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay at Mr. Lathrop's so long, nuther. How fur is it?”

“A little short of four miles—right out in the country, back here.”

“Well, that'll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or halfpast, tonight, and then get them to fetch you home again—tell them you've thought of something. If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up, wait till eleven, and then if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.”

“Good,” she says, “I'll do it.”

“And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.”

“Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!” she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too.

“If I get away I sha'n't be here,” I says, “to prove these rapscallions ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I was here. I could swear they was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something. Well, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they're people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be. I'll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There—‘Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.' Put it away, and don't lose it. When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they've got the men that played the ‘Royal Nonesuch', and ask for some witnesses—why, you'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they'll come a-biling, too.”

I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:

“Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry. Nobody don't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till they get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count, and they ain't going to get no money. It's just like the way it was with the niggers—it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can't collect the money for the niggers yet—they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”

“Well,” she says, “I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start straight for Mr. Lathrop's.”

“Deed, that ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,” I says, “By no manner of means; go before breakfast.”

“Why?”

“What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?”

“Well, I never thought—and come to think, I don't know. What was it?”

“Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I don't want no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never—”

“There, there, don't! Yes, I'll go before breakfast—I'll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?”

“Yes; never mind about them. They've got to stand it yet awhile. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don't want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of them. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you'll be back tonight or early in the morning.”

“Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to them.”

“Well, then, it sha'n't be.” It was well enough to tell her so—no harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it's the little things that smoothe people's roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing. Then I says: “There's one more thing—that bag of money.”

“Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think—they got it.”

“No, you're out, there. They hain't got it.”

“Why, who's got it?”

“I wish I knowed, but I don't. I had it, because I stole it from them:and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm afraid it ain't there no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run—and it warn't a good place.”

“Oh, stop blaming yourself—it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow it—you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault. Where did you hide it?”

I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:

“I'd ruther not tell you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lathrop's, if you want to. Do you reckon that'll do?”

“Oh, yes.”

So I wrote: “I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”

It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says:

“Good-bye. I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you, and I'll think of you a many and a many a time, and I'll pray for you, too!”—and she was gone.

Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same—she was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion—there warn't no backdown to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see;in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain't no flattery. And when it comes to beauty—and goodness, too—she lays over them all. I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of the door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon I've thought of her a many and 'a' many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I'd 'a' thought it would do any good for me to pray for her, blamed if I wouldn't 'a' done it or bust.

Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her go. When I struck Susan and the harelip, I says:

“What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes?”

They says:

“There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly.”

“That's the name,” I says; “I most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry—one of them's sick.”

“Which one?”

“I don't know; leastways I kinder forget; but I think it's—”

“Sakes alive, I hope it ain't Hanner?”

“I'm sorry to say it,” I says, “But Hanner's the very one.”

“My goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?”

“It ain't no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane said, and they don't think she'll last many hours.”

“Only think of that, now! What's the matter with her!”

I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:

“Mumps.”

“Mumps, your granny! They don't set up with people that's got the mumps.”

“They don't, don't they? You better bet they do with these mumps. These mumps is different. It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said.”

“How's it a new kind?”

“Because it's mixed up with other things.”

“What other things?”

“Well, measles, and whooping cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and yeller janders, and brain fever, and I don't know what all.”

“My land! And they call it the mumps?”

“That's what Miss Mary Jane said.”

“Well, what in the nation do they call it the mumps for?”

“Why, because it is the mumps. That's what it starts with.”

“Well, ther' ain't no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull up and say, ‘why, he stumped his toe.' Would ther' be any sense in that? No. And ther' ain't no sense in this, nuther. Is it ketching?”

“Is it ketching? Why, how you talk. Is a harrow catching—in the dark? If you don't hitch onto one tooth, you're bound to on another, ain't you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of harrow, as you may say—and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.”

“Well, it's awful, I think,” says the harelip. “I'll go to Uncle Harvey and—”

“Oh, yes,” I says, “I would. Of course I would. I wouldn't lose no time.”

“Well, why wouldn't you?”

“Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain't your uncles obleeged to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? You know they'll wait for you. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he? Very well, then; is a preacher going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a ship clerk? —so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now you know he ain't. What will he do, then? Why, he'll say, ‘It's a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can;for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she's got it.' But never mind, if you think it's best to tell your uncle Harvey—”

“Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.”

“Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors.”

“Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can't you see that they'd go and tell? Ther' ain't no way but just not to tell anybody at all.”

“Well, maybe you're right—yes, I judge you are right.”

“But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out awhile, anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?”

“Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, ‘Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over the river to see Mr.'—Mr.—what is the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of? —I mean the one that—”

“Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?”

“Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to remember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else; and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come, and then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; and if she is, she'll be home in the morning anyway. She said, don't say nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps—which'll be perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told me so, herself.”

“All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.

Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn't say nothing because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat—I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't 'a' done it no neater himself. Of course he would 'a' throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not being brung up to it.

Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he was on hand and looking his level piousest, up there longside of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.

But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold—everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So they'd got to work that off—I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow everything. Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:

“Here's your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old Peter Wilks—and you pays your money and you takes your choice!”





Chapter XXIX


They was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my souls, how the people yelled, and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn't see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any. I reckoned they'd turn pale. But no, nary a pale did they turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see, straight off he pronounced like an Englishman—not the king's way, though the king's was pretty good for an imitation. I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:

“This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his arm and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks's brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can't hear nor speak—and can't even make signs to amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait.”

So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out:

“Broke his arm—very likely, ain't it? —and very convenient, too, for a fraud that's got to make signs, and hain't learnt how. Lost their baggage! That's mighty good! —and mighty ingenious—under the circumstances!”

So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a sharp looking gentleman, with a carpetbag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads—it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:

“Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this town?”

“The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.

“But what time o' day?”

“In the evenin'—'bout an hour er two before sundown.”

“How'd you come?”

“I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”

“Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the mornin'—in a canoe?”

“I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'.”

“It's a lie.”

Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher.

“Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint that mornin'. I live up there, don't I? Well, I was up there, and he was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy.”

The doctor he up and says:

“Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”

“I reckon I would, but I don't know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know him perfectly easy.”

It was me he pointed at. The doctor says:

“Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not;but if these two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all. I think it's our duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I reckon we'll find out something before we get through.”

It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends;so we all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.

We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:

“I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about. If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It ain't unlikely. If these men ain't frauds, they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're all right—ain't that so?”

Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked sorrowful, and says:

“Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there;you k'n send and see, if you want to.”

“Where is it, then?”

“Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein' used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England. The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went downstairs; and when I sold 'em, I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got clean away with it. My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen.”

The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn't altogether believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them. That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says:

“Are you English, too?”

I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”

Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about supper, nor ever seemed to think about it—and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it was the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n;and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would 'a' seen that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:

“Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you. I reckon you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is practice. You do it pretty awkward.”

I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway.

The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:

“If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell—”

The king broke in and reached out his hand, and says:

“Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often about?”

The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:

“That'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.”

So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke—and then for the first time the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:

“You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.”

The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says:

“Well, it beats me—”and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then them again; and then says: “These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here's these two's handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't write them” (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), “and here's this old gentleman's handwriting, and anybody can tell, easy enough, he didn't write them—fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly writing at all. Now, here's some letters from-—”

The new old gentleman says:

“If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother there—so he copies for me. It's his hand you've got there, not mine.”

“Well!” says the lawyer, “This is a state of things. I've got some of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we can com—”

“He can't write with his left hand,” says the old gentleman. “If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too. Look at both, please—they're by the same hand.”

The lawyer done it, and says:

“I believe it's so—and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a slution, but it's gone to grass, partly. But anyway, one thing is proved—these two ain't either of 'em Wilkses”—and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.

Well, what do you think? That mule-headed old fool wouldn't give in then! Indeed he wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test. Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried to write—he see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying, himself; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:

“I've thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br—helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?”

“Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it. We're both here.”

Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:

“Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”

Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd 'a' squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice, because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, Now he'll throw up the sponge—there ain't no more use. Well, did he? A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't. I reckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:

“Mf! It's a very tough question, ain't it! Yes, sir, I k'n tell you what's tatooed on his breast. It's jest a small, thin, blue arrow—that's what it is; and if you don't look close, you can't see it. Now what do you say—hey?”

Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek.

The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king this time, and says:

“There—you've heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks's breast?”

Both of them spoke up and says:

“We didn't see no such mark.”

“Good!” says the old gentleman. “Now, what you did see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, and dashes between them, so: P—B—W”—and he marked them that way on a piece of paper. “Come, ain't that what you saw?”

Both of them spoke up again, and says:

“No, we didn't. We never seen any marks at all.”

Well, everybody was in a state of mind now, and they sings out:

“The whole bilin' of' m's frauds! Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's ride'em on a rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says:

“Gentlemen—gentlemen! Hear me just a word—just a single word—if you PLEASE! There's one way yet—let's go and dig up the corpse and look.”

That took them.

“Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out:

“Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch them along, too!”

“We'll do it!” they all shouted: “and if we don't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang!”

I was scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening.

As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her the wink, she'd light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats.

Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tatoo marks. If they didn't find them—

I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist—Hines—and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.

When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one.

So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.

At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.

All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out:

“By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!”

Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.

I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew—leastways, I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!

When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all dark—which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, flash comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world. She was the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.

The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would 'a' just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn't. As I sprung aboard I sung out:

“Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we're shut of them!”

Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drowned A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says:

“Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and let her slide!”

So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it did seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few times—I couldn't help it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they come! —and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke.

So I wilted right down onto the planks then, and give up; and it was all I could do to keep from crying.





Chapter XXX


When they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and says:

“Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup! Tired of our company, hey?”

I says:

“No, your majesty, we warn't—please don't, your majesty!”

“Quick, then, and tell us what was your idea, or I'll shake the insides out o' you!”

“Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty. The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure! ' and I lit out. It didn't seem no good for me to stay—I couldn't do nothing, and I didn't want to be hung if I could get away. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and when I got there I told Jim to hurry, or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't.”

Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh, yes, it's mighty likely!” and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he'd drowned me. But the duke says:

“Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would you 'a' done any different? Did you inquire around for him when you got loose? I don't remember it.”

So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it. But the duke says:

“You better a blame' sight give yourself a good cussing, for you're the one that's entitled to it most. You hain't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That was bright—it was right down bully;and it was the thing that saved us. For if it hadn't been for that, they'd 'a' jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come—and then—the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the graveyard, and the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we'd 'a' slept in our cravats tonight—cravats warranted to wear, too—longer than we'd need 'em.”

They was still a minute—thinking; then the king says, kind of absent-minded like:

“Mf! And we reckoned the niggers stole it!”

That made me squirm!

“Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, “we did.”

After about a half a minute the king drawls out:

“Leastways, I did.”

The duke says, the same way:

“On the contrary, I did.”

The king kind of ruffles up, and says:

“Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?”

The duke says, pretty brisk:

“When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask what was you referring to?”

“Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “But I don't know—maybe you was asleep, and didn't know what you was about.”

The duke bristles right up now, and says:

“Oh, let up on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool? Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?”

“Yes, sir! I know you do know, because you done it yourself!”

“It's a lie!”—and the duke went for him. The king sings out:

“Take y'r hands off! —leggo my throat! —I take it all back!”

The duke says:

“Well, you just own up, first, that you did hide that money there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it up, and have it all to yourself.”

“Wait jest a minute, duke—answer me this one question, honest and fair; if you didn't put that money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and take back everything I said.”

“You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't. There, now!”

“Well, then, I b'lieve you. But answer me only jest this one more—now don't git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?”

The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:

“Well, I don't care if I did, I didn't do it, anyway. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you done it.”

“I wisht I may never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest. I won't say I warn't goin' to do it, because I was; but you—I mean somebody—got in ahead o' me.”

“It's a lie! You done it, and you got to say you done it, or—”

The king begun to gurgle, and then he gasps out:

“‘Nough! —I own up!”

I was very glad to hear him say that, it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and says:

“If you ever deny it again, I'll drown you. It's well for you to set there and blubber like a baby—it's fitten for you, after the way you've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to believe that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffesit—you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the ‘Nonesuch' and one thing or another, and scoop it all!”

The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:

“Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffersit; it warn't me.”

“Dry up! I don't want to hear no more out of you!” says the duke.“And now you see what you got by it. They've got all their own money back, and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides. G'long to bed, and don't you deffersit me no more deffersits, long's you live!”

So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackled his bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a snoring in each other's arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.





Chapter XXXI


We dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.

First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a dancing school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried a go at yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizering, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.

And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore, and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the “Royal Nonesuch”there yet. (“House to rob, you mean,” says I to myself; “and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft—and you'll have to take it out in wondering.”) And he said if he warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.

So we staid where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a chance for the change on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it, I lit out, and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:

“Set her loose, Jim; we're all right now!”

But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout—and then another—and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching;but it warn't no use—old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried;I couldn't help it. But I couldn't set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:

“Yes.”

“Whereabouts?” says I.

“Down to Silas Phelps's place, two miles below here. He's a runaway nigger, and they've got him. Was you looking for him?”

“You bet I ain't! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out—and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since;afeard to come out.”

“Well,” he says, “You needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him. He run off f'm down South, som'ers.”

“It's a good job they got him.”

“Well, I reckon! There's two hundred dollars' reward on him. It's like picking up money out'n the road.”

“Yes, it is—and I could 'a' had it if I'd been big enough; I see him first. Who nailed him?”

“It was an old fellow—a stranger—and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait. Think o' that, now! You bet I'd wait, if it was seven year.”

“That's me, every time,” says I. “But maybe his chance ain't worth no more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap. Maybe there's something ain't straight about it.”

“But it is, though—straight as a string. I see the handbill myself. It tells all about him, to a dot—paints him like a picture, and tells the plantation he's frum, below Newrleans. No-siree-bob, they ain't no trouble 'bout that speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won't ye?”

I didn't have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in the wigwam to think. But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble. After all this long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars.

Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he's got to be a slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion, for two things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of me! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That's just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this, the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, “There was the Sunday-school, you could 'a' gone to it; and if you'd 'a' done it they'd 'a' learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.”

It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from me, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was because my heart warn't right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing double. I was letting on to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth say I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie—I found that out.

So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter—and then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:





Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send.





HUCK FINN.





I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.

It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:

“All right, then, I'll go to hell”—and tore it up.

It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And for a starter, I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again;and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.

Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.

Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, “Phelps's Sawmill,” and when I come to the farmhouses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the “Royal Nonesuch”—three-night performance—like the other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:

“Hel-lo! Where'd you come from?” Then he says, kind of glad and eager, “Where's the raft? —got her in a good place?”

I says: “Why, that's just what I was agoing to ask your grace.”

Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:

“What was your idea for asking me?” he says.

“Well,” I says, “When I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went a loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark, then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, “they've got into trouble and had to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living'; so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what did become of the raft, then? —and Jim—poor Jim!”

“Blamed if I know—that is, what's become of the raft. That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half dollars with him and got every cent but what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, ‘that little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.'”

“I wouldn't shake my nigger, would I? —the only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.”

“We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him our nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn't anything for it but to try the ‘Royal Nonesuch' another shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where's that ten cents? Give it here.”

I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I had and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:

“Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We'd skin him if he done that!”

“How can he blow? Hain't he run off.?”

“No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's gone.”

“Sold him?” I says, and begun to cry; “Why, he was my nigger, and that was my money. Where is he? —I want my nigger.”

“Well, you can't get your nigger, that's all—so dry up your blubbering. Looky here—do you think you'd venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I'd trust you. Why, if you was to blow on us—”

He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:

“I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow; I got to turn out and find my nigger.”

He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:

“I'll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you'll promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you where to find him.”

So I promised, and he says:

“A farmer by the name of Silas Ph—” and then he stopped. You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to study and think agin, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says:

“The man that bought him is named Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”

“All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days. And I'll start this very afternoon.”

“No you won't, you'll start now; and don't lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with us, d'ye hear?”

That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I wanted to be left free to work my plans.

“So clear out,” he says; “And can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim is your nigger—some idiots don't require documents—leastways I've heard there's such down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus, maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out. Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don't work your jaw any between here and there.”

So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn't look around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I could tire him out at that. I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps's. I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could get away. I didn't want no trouble with their kind. I'd seen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.





Chapter XXXII


When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny; the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits whispering—spirits that's been dead ever so many years—and you always think they're talking about you. As a general thing it makes a body wish he was dead, too, and done with it all.

Phelps's was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump onto a horse; some sickly grass patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log house for the white folks—hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud stripes been whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad, open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smokehouse back of the kitchen; three little log nigger cabins in a row t'other side the smokehouse; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there, in the sun;more hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cottonfields begins, and after the fields, the woods.

I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again;and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead—for that is the lonesomest sound in the whole world.

I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone.

When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And such another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you may say—spokes made out of dogs—circle of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a coming; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.

A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling pin in her hand, singing out, “Begone! you Tige! you Spot! begone, sah!” and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling, and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back, wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. There ain't no harm in a hound, nohow.

And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always do. And here comes the white woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning stick in her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same way the little niggers was doing. She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand—and says:

“It's you, at last! ain't it?”

I out with a “Yes'm” before I thought.

She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, “You don't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you! Dear, dear, it does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it's your cousin Tom! —tell him howdy.”

But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and hid behind her. So she run on:

“Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away—or did you get your breakfast on the boat?”

I said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:

“Now I can have a good look at you: and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's come at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more. What's kep' you? —boat get aground?”

“Yes'm—she—”

“Don't say yes'm—say Aunt Sally. Where'd she get aground?”

I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up—from down towards Orleans. That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the names of bars down that way. I see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on—or—Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:

“It warn't the grounding—that didn't keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder head.”

“Good gracious! anybody hurt?”

“No'm. Killed a nigger.”

“Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt. Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder head and crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a Babtist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well. Yes, I remember now, he did die. Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him. But it didn't save him. Yes, it was mortification—that was it. He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to look at. Your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be back any minute now. You must 'a' met him on the road, didn't you? —oldish man, with a—”

“No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.”

“Who'd you give the baggage to?”

“Nobody.”

“Why, child, it'll be stole!”

“Not where I hid it I reckon it won't.” I says.

“How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”

It was kinder thin ice, but I says:

“The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch, and give me all I wanted.”

I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. I had my mind on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn't get no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back, because she says:

“But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a word about Sis, nor any of them. Now I'll rest my works a little, and you start up yourn; just tell me everything—tell me all about 'm all—every one of 'em; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of.”

Well, I see I was up a stump—and up it good. Providence had stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now, I see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead—I'd got to throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:

“Here he comes! stick your head down lower—there, that'll do;you can't be seen now. Don't you let on you're here. I'll play a joke on him. Children, don't you say a word.”

I see I was in a fix now. But it warn't no use to worry; there warn't nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck.

I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in;then the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:

“Has he come?”

“No,” says her husband.

“Good-ness gracious!” she says, “What in the world can have become of him?”

“I can't imagine,” says the old gentleman; “And I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy.”

“Uneasy!” she says, “I'm ready to go distracted! He must 'a' come;and you've missed him along the road. I know it's so—something tells me so.”

“Why Sally, I couldn't miss him along the road—you know that.”

“But oh, dear, dear, what will Sis say! He must 'a' come! You must 'a' missed him. He—”

“Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed. I don't know what in the world to make of it. I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind acknowledging't I'm right down scared. But there's no hope that he's come; for he couldn't come and me miss him. Sally, it's terrible-just terrible—something's happened to the boat, sure!”

“Why, Silas! Look yonder! —up the road! —ain't that somebody coming?”

He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared, and says:

“Why, who's that?”

“Who do you reckon 't is?”

“I hain't no idea. Who is it?”

“It's Tom Sawyer!”

By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn't no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of the tribe.

But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well, they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn't hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family—I mean the Sawyer family—than ever happened to any six Sawyer families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to fix it. Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because they didn't know but what it would take three days to fix it. If I'd 'a' called it a bolt-head it would 'a' done just as well.

Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river. Then I says to myself, s'pose Tom Sawyer come down on that boat? And s'pose he steps in here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet?

Well, I couldn't have it that way; it wouldn't do at all. I must go up the road and waylay him. So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage. The old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me.





Chapter XXXIII


So I started for town, in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till he come along. I says “Hold on!” and it stopped alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and staid so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says:

“I hain't ever done you no harm. You know that. So then, what you want to come back and ha'nt me for?”

I says:

“I hain't come back—I hain't been gone.”

When he heard my voice, it righted him up some, but he warn't quite satisfied yet. He says:

“Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you. Honest injun, now, you ain't a ghost?”

“Honest injun, I ain't,” I says.

“Well—I—I—well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can't somehow seem to understand it no way. Looky here, warn't you ever murdered at all?”

“No. I warn't ever murdered at all—I played it on them. You come in here and feel of me if you don't believe me.”

So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again he didn't know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? He said, let him alone a minute, and don't disturb him. So he thought and thought, and pretty soon he says:

“It's all right; I've got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on it's yourn; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;and you needn't let on to know me at first.”

I says:

“All right; but wait a minute. There's one more thing—a thing that nobody don't know but me. And that is, there's a nigger here that I'm a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is Jim—old Miss Watson's Jim.”

He says:

“What! Why, Jim is—”

He stopped and went to studying. I says:

“I know what you'll say. You'll say it's dirty, low-down business;but what if it is? I'm low down; and I'm a-going to steal him, and I want you to keep mum and not let on. Will you?”

His eye lit up, and he says:

“I'll help you steal him!”

Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard—and I'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer a nigger-stealer!

“Oh, shucks;” I says; “you're joking.”

“I ain't joking, either.”

“Well, then,” I says, “joking or no joking, if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that you don't know nothing about him, and I don't know nothing about him.”

Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door, and he says:

“Why, this is wonderful! Whoever would 'a' thought it was in that mare to do it? I wish we'd 'a' timed her. And she hain't sweated a hair—not a hair. It's wonderful. Why, I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that horse now—I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd 'a' sold her for fifteen before, and thought 'twas all she was worth.”

That's all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see. But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South.

In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty yards, and says:

“Why, there's somebody come! I wonder who 'tis? Why, I do believe it's a stranger. Jimmy” (that's one of the children), “run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner.”

Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger don't come every year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for the house, the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience—and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable. He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no, he come ca'm and important, like the ram. When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them, and says:

“Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?”

“No, my boy,” says the old gentleman, “I'm sorry to say't your driver has deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more. Come in, come in.”

Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, “Too late—he's out of sight.”

“Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with us; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols's.”

“Oh, I can't make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it. I'll walk—I don't mind the distance.”

“But we won't let you walk—it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to do it. Come right in.”

“Oh, do,” says Aunt Sally; “It ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a bit in the world. You must stay. It's a long, dusty three mile, and we can't let you walk. And besides, I've already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us. Come right in and make yourself at home.”

So Tom thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson—and he made another bow.

Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent, and I was getting a little nervous, and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last, still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand, and says:

“You owdacious puppy!”

He looked kind of hurt, and says:

“I'm surprised at you, ma'am.”

“You're s'rp—Why, what do you reckon I am? I've a good notion to take and—Say, what do you mean by kissing me?”

He looked kind of humble, and says:

“I didn't mean nothing, ma'am. I didn't mean no harm. I—I—thought you'd like it.”

“Why, you born fool!” She took up the spinning-stick, and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it. “What made you think I'd like it?”

“Well, I don't know. Only, they—they—told me you would.”

“They told you I would. Whoever told you's another lunatic. I never heard the beat of it. Who's they?”

“Why, everybody. They all said so, ma'am.”

It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:

“Who's ‘everybody'? Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot short.”

He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:

“I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. They told me to. They all told me to. They all said, ‘kiss her'; and said ‘she'd like it'. They all said it—every one of them. But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it no more—I won't, honest.”

“You won't, won't you? Well, I sh'd reckon you won't!”

“No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again—till you ask me.”

“Till I ask you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days! I lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before I ask you—or the likes of you.”

“Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so. I can't make it out, somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would. But—” He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, “Didn't you think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?”

“Why, no, I—I—well, no, I b'lieve I didn't.”

Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:

“Tom, didn't you think Aunt Sally'd open out her arms and say, ’Sid Sawyer—'”

“My land!” she says, breaking in and jumping for him, “you impudent young rascal, to fool a body so—” and was going to hug him, but he fended her off, and says:

“No, not till you've asked me first.”

So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he took what was left. And after they got a little quiet again she says:

“Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn't looking for you at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him.”

“It's because it warn't intended for any of us to come but Tom,” he says; “But I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger. But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain't no healthy place for a stranger to come.”

“No—not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I hain't been so put out since I don't know when. But I don't care, I don't mind the terms—I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here. Well, to think of that performance! I don't deny it, I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack.”

We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families—and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.

There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:

“Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”

“No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time.”

So there it was! —but I couldn't help it. Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid goodnight and went up to bed, right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the lightning—rod; and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.

On the road Tom told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our “Royal Nonesuch” rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the middle of it—it was as much as half after eight then—here comes a raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail—that is, I knowed it was the king and the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the world that was human—just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to see. Human beings can be awful cruel to one another.

We see we was too late—couldn't do no good. We asked some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and the house rose up and went for them.

So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow—though I hadn't done nothing. But that's always the way; it don't make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If I had a yaller dog that didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him. It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet ain't no good, nohow. Tom Sawyer he says the same.





Chapter XXXIV


We stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says:

“Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I bet I know where Jim is.”

“No! Where?”

“In that hut down by the ash hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?”

“Yes.”

“What did you think the vittles was for?”

“For a dog.”

“So'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog.”

“Why?”

“Because part of it was watermelon.”

“So it was—I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don't see at the same time.”

“Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table—same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people's all so kind and good. Jim's the prisoner. All right—I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we like the best.”

What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer's head I wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:

“Ready?”

“Yes,” I says.

“All right—bring it out.”

“My plan is this,” I says. “We can easy find out if it's Jim in there. Then get up my canoe tomorrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn't that plan work?”

“Work? Why cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it's too blame' simple; there ain't nothing to it. What's the good of a plan that ain't no more trouble than that? It's as mild as goosemilk. Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.”

I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different;but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn't have none of them objections to it.

And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way it was. I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done.

Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before everybody. I couldn't understand it no way at all. It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself. And I did start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:

“Don't you reckon I know what I'm about? Don't I generly know what I'm about?”

“Yes.”

“Didn't I say I was going to help steal the nigger?”

“Yes.”

“Well, then.”

That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say any more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have it so, I couldn't help it.

When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to the hut by the ash hopper for to examine it. We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with—which was the north side—we found a square window hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:

“Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board.”

Tom says:

“It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky. I should hope we can find a way that's a little more complicated than that, Huck Finn.”

“Well, then,” I says, “how'll it do to saw him out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?”

“That's more like,” he says. “It's real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,” he says; “but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long. There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.”

Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as the hut, but narrow—only about six foot wide. The door to it was at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and see the shed was only built against the cabin and hadn't no connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says:

“Now we're all right. We'll dig him out. It'll take about a week!”

Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door—you only have to pull a buckskin latchstring, they don't fasten the doors—but that warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning rod. But after he got up half-way about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he was rested, he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time he made the trip.

In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim—if it was Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house.

This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do. So Tom says:

“What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?”

The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:

“Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at 'im?”

“Yes.”

I hunched Tom, and whispers:

“You going, right here in the daybreak? That warn't the plan.”

“No, it warn't; but it's the plan now.”

So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got in we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:

“Why, Huck! En good lan'! ain'dat Misto Tom?”

I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn't know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't 'a' done it, because that nigger busted in and says:

“Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”

We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says:

“Does who know us?”

“Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”

“I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”

“What put it dar? Didn't he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed you?”

Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:

“Well, that's mighty curious. Who sung out? When did he sing out? What did he sing out?” And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says, “Did you hear anybody sing out?”

Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:

“No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.”

Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and says:

“Did you sing out?”

“No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain't said nothing, sah.”

“Not a word?”

“No, sah, I hain't said a word.”

“Did you ever see us before?”

“No, sah; not as I knows on.”

So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe:

“What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody sung out?”

“Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey's awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so. Please to don't tell nobody 'bout it, sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole me; 'kase he say dey ain't no witches. I jis' wish to goodness he was heah now—den what would he say! I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun' it dis time. But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's sot, stays sot; dey won't look into noth'n en fine it out f'r deyselves, en when you fine it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you.”

Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:

“I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give him up, I'd hang him.” And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says:

“Don't ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights, it's us; we're going to set you free.”

Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then.





Chapter XXXV


It would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have some light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called fox fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place. We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:

“Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain't no watchman to be drugged—now there ought to be a watchman. There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping mixture to. And there's Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim could 'a' got out of that window hole before this, only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent all the difficulties. Well, we can't help it; we got to do the best we can with the materials we've got. Anyhow, there's one thing—there's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to let on that a lantern's resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get.”

“What do we want of a saw?”

“What do we want of a saw? Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed off, so as to get the chain loose?”

“Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off.”

“Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn. You can get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain't you ever read any books at all? —Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see no sign of its being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat—because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know—and there's your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. It's gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one.”

I says:

“What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under the cabin?”

But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head; then sighs again, and says:

“No, it wouldn't do—there ain't necessity enough for it.”

“For what?” I says.

“Why, to saw Jim's leg off,” he says.

“Good land!” I says: “why, there ain't no necessity for it. And what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?”

“Well, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn't get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg would be better still. But we got to let that go. There ain't necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so we'll let it go. But there's one thing—he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And we can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way. And I've et worse pies.”

“Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain't got no use for a rope ladder.”

“He has got use for it. How you talk, you better say; you don't know nothing about it. He's got to have a rope ladder; they all do.”

“What in the nation can he do with it?”

“Do with it? He can hide it in his bed, can't he? That's what they all do; and he's got to, too. Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. S'pose he don't do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed, for a clue, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clues? Of course they will. And you wouldn't leave them any? That would be a pretty howdy-do, wouldn't it! I never heard of such a thing.”

“Well,” I says, “If it's in the regulations, and he's got to have it, all right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no regulations;but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer—if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're born. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no experience, and so he don't care what kind of a—”

“Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep still—that's what I'd do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it's perfectly ridiculous.”

“Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothes line.”

He said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says:

“Borrow a shirt, too.”

“What do we want of a shirt, Tom?”

“Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.”

“Journal your granny—Jim can't write.”

“S'pose he can't write—he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel hoop?”

“Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one; and quicker, too.”

“Prisoners don't have geese running around the donjonkeep to pull pens out of, you muggins. They always make their pens out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall. They wouldn't use a goose quill if they had it. It ain't regular.”

“Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?”

“Many makes it out of iron rust and tears; but that's the common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. The Iron Mask always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too.”

“Jim ain't got no tin plate. They feed him in a pan.”

“That ain't nothing; we can get him some.”

“Can't nobody read his plates.”

“That ain't got anything to do with it, Huck Finn. All he's got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don't have to be able to read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.”

“Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?”

“Why, blame it all, it ain't the prisoner's plates.”

“But it's somebody's plates, ain't it?”

“Well, spos'n it is? What does the prisoner care whose—”

He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast horn blowing. So we cleared out for the house.

Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and got the fox fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don't blame them for it, either. It ain't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn't a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we needed. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't need it to get out of prison with; there's where the difference was. He said if I'd 'a' wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would 'a' been all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.

Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk. He says:

“Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed.”

“Tools?” I says.

“Yes.”

“Tools for what?”

“Why, to dig with. We ain't a-going to gnaw him out, are we?”

“Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with?” I says.

He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:

“Huck Finn, did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with? Now I want to ask you—if you got any reasonableness in you at all—what kind of a show would that give him to be a hero? Why, they might as well lend him the key and done with it. Picks and shovels—why, they wouldn't furnish 'em to a king.”

“Well, then,” I says, “if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do we want?”

“A couple of case knives.”

“To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?”

“Yes.”

“Confound it, it's foolish, Tom.”

“It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the right way—and it's the regular way. And there ain't no other way, that ever I heard of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these things. They always dig out with a case knife—and not through dirt, mind you; generly it's through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was he at it, you reckon?”

“I don't know.”

“Well, guess.”

“I don't know. A month and a half.”

“Thirty-seven year—and he come out in China. That's the kind. I wish the bottom of this fortress was solid rock.”

“Jim don't know nobody in China.”

“What's that got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow. But you're always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can't you stick to the main point?”

“All right—I don't care where he comes out, so he comes out; and Jim don't, either, I reckon. But there's one thing, anyway—Jim's too old to be dug out with a case knife. He won't last.”

“Yes he will last, too. You don't reckon it's going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a dirt foundation, do you?”

“How long will it take, Tom?”

“Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He'll hear Jim ain't from there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can't. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can let on, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm. Yes, I reckon that'll be the best way.”

“Now, there's sense in that,” I says. “Letting on don't cost nothing;letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn't strain me none, after I got my hand in. So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case knives.”

“Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out of.”

“Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it,” I says,“there's an old rusty saw blade around yonder sticking under the weatherboarding behind the smoke-house.”

He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:

“It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and smouch the knives—three of them.” So I done it.





Chapter XXXVI


As soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom said we was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim's counterpin hung down most to the ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything hardly. At last I says:

“This ain't no thirty-seven-year job; this is a thirty-eight-year job, Tom Sawyer.”

He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says:

“It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But we can't fool along; we got to rush;we ain't got no time to spare. If we was to put in another night this way we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well—couldn't touch a case knife with them sooner.”

“Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”

“I'll tell you. It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way: we got to dig him out with the picks, and let on it's case knives.”

“Now you're talking!” I says; “your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,” I says. “Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing I'm agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.”

“Well,” he says, “there's excuse for picks and letting on in a case like this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by and see the rules broke—because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows better. It might answer for you to dig Jim out with a pick, without any letting on, because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case knife.”

He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and says:

“Gimme a case knife.”

I didn't know just what to do—but then I thought. I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickax and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word.

He was always just that particular. Full of principle.

So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it. When I got upstairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning rod, but he couldn't come it, his hands was so sore. At last he says:

“It ain't no use, it can't be done. What you reckon I better do? Can't you think of no way?”

“Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain't regular. Come up the stairs, and let on it's a lightning rod.”

So he done it.

Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog fennel and jimpson weeds under the window hole—then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says:

“Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”“Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it done.”

He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we'd got to post Jim first.

That night we went down the lightning rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window hole, and heard Jim snoring, so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, sure. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:

“Now I know how to fix it. We'll send you some things by them.”

I said, “Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck”; but he never paid no attention to me; went right in.It was his way when he'd got his plans set.

So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them;and we would put small things in uncle's coat pockets and he must steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her apron pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood and all that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn't see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as Tom said.

Jim had plenty of corncob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.

In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could 'a' worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.

And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches” once, and keeled over onto the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again. He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:

“Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks. I did, mos' sholy. Mars Sid, I felt um—I felt um, sah; dey was all over me. Dad fetch it, I jis' wisht I could git my han's on one er dem witches jis' wunst—on'y jis' wunst—it's all I'd ast. But mos'ly I wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does.”

Tom says:

“Well, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger's breakfast time? It's because they're hungry; that's the reason. You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for you to do.”

“But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie? I doan' know how to make it. I hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo'.”

“Well, then, I'll have to make it myself.”

“Will you do it, honey? —will you? I'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot, I will!”

“All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger. But you got to be mighty careful. When we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we've put in the pan, don't you let on you see it at all. And don't you look when Jim unloads the pan—something might happen, I don't know what. And above all, don't you handle the witch things.”

“Hannel 'm, Mars Sid? What is you a-talkin' 'bout? I wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars, I wouldn't.”





Chapter XXXVII


That was all fixed. So then we went away and went to the rubbage pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally's apron pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas' hat, which was on the bureau, because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas' coat pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come yet, so we had to wait a little while.

And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardly wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the other, and says:

“I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what has become of your other shirt.”

My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard piece of corn crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing worm, and let a cry out of him the size of a war whoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would 'a' sold out for half price if there was a bidder. But after that we was all right again—it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.Uncle Silas he says:

“It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it. I know perfectly well I took it off, because—”

“Because you hain't got but one on. Just listen at the man! I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo's line yesterday—I see it there myself. But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and you'll just have to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to make a new one. And it'll be the third I've made in two years. It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to do with 'm all is more'n I can make out. A body'd think you would learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life.”

“I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn't to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe I've ever lost one of them off of me.”

“Well, it ain't your fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd 'a' done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther. Ther's a spoon gone; and that ain't all. There was ten, and now ther's only nine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, that's certain.”

“Why, what else is gone, Sally?”

“Ther's six candles gone—that's what. The rats could 'a' got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk off with the whole place, the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair, Silas—you'd never find it out; but you can't lay the spoon on the rats, and that I know.”

“Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss;but I won't let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes.”

“Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year'll do. Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps.”

Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman steps onto the passage, and says:

“Missus, dey's a sheet gone.”

“A sheet gone! Well, for the land's sake!”

“I'll stop up them holes today,” says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.

“Oh, do shet up! —s'pose the rats took the sheet? Where's it gone, Lize?”

“Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally. She wuz on de clo's line yistiddy, but she done gone: she ain' dah no mo' now.”

“I reckon the world is coming to an end. I never see the beat of it in all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can—”

“Missus,” comes a young yaller wench, “dey's a brass candlestick mis'n.”

“Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to ye!”

Well, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. She stopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in Jerusalem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:

“It's just as I expected. So you had it in your pocket all the time;and like as not you've got the other things there, too. How'd it get there?”

“I reely don't know, Sally,” he says, kind of apologizing, “or you know I would tell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in, but I'll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I didn't put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon, and—”

“Oh, for the land's sake! Give a body a rest! Go 'long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got back my peace of mind.”

I'd 'a' heard her if she'd 'a' said it to herself, let alone speaking it out; and I'd 'a' got up and obeyed her if I'd 'a' been dead. As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the shingle nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel shelf, and never said nothing, and went out. Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:

“Well, it ain't no use to send things by him no more, he ain't reliable.” Then he says: “But he done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without him knowing it—stop up his rat holes.”

There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other, looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went a-mooning around, first to one rat hole and then another, till he'd been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying:

“Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it. I could show her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats. But never mind—let it go. I reckon it wouldn't do no good.”

And so he went on a-mumbling upstairs, and then we left. He was a mighty nice old man. And always is.

Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we'd got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and Tom says:

“Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons yet.”

She says:

“Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I counted 'm myself.”

“Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.”

She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count—anybody would.

“I declare to gracious ther' ain't but nine!” she says. “Why, what in the world—plague take the things, I'll count 'm again.”

So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says:

“Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's ten now!” and she looked hurry and bothered both. But Tom says:

“Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.”

“You numbskull, didn't you see me count 'm?”

“I know, but—”

“Well, I'll count 'm again.”

So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well, she was in a tearing way—just a-trembling all over, she was so mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cler out and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because he said now she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she did; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more.

So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more, and she didn't care, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life; she druther die first.

So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting, and as to the candlestick it warn't no consequence, it would blow over by and by.

But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three washpans full of flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course we thought of the right way at last—which was to cook the ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could 'a' hung a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.

And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd 'a' wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausages, or anything you choose. We could 'a' had a whole dinner.

But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the washpan—afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancestors with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there but she failed on the first pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm talking about, and lay him in enough stomach ache to last him till next time, too.

Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window hole.





Chapter XXXVIII


Making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw;and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That's the one which the prisoner has to scribble on the wall. But he had to have it; Tom said he'd got to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.

“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why, Huck, s'pose it is considerable trouble? —what you going to do? —how you going to get around it? Jim's got to do his inscription and coat of arms. They all do.”

Jim says:

“Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arms; I hain't got nuffn but dish yere ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat.”

“Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different.”

“Well,” I says, “Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat of arms, because he hain't.”

“I reckon I knowed that,” Tom says, “but you bet he'll have one before he goes out of this—because he's going out right, and there ain't going to be no flaws in his record.”

So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim a-making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he'd struck so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one which he reckoned he'd decide on. He says:

“On the scutcheon we'll have a bend or in the dexter base, a saltire murrey in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron vert in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a field azure, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, sable, with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, Maggiore fretta, minore atto. Got it out of a book—means the more haste the less speed.”

“Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it mean?”

“We ain't got no time to bother over that,” he says; “we got to dig in like all git-out.”

“Well, anyway,” I says, “what's some of it? What's a fess?”

“A fess—a fess is—you don't need to know what a fess is. I'll show him how to make it when he gets to it.”

“Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person. What's a bar sinister?”

“Oh, I don't know. But he's got to have it. All the nobility does.”

That was just his way. If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you, he wouldn't do it. You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't make no difference.

He'd got all that coat-of-arms business fixed, so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a mournful inscription—said Jim got to have one, like they all done. He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:





1. Here a captive heart busted.

2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life.

3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity.

4. Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.





Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down. When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble onto the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck onto the logs with a nail, and he didn't know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:

“Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock. We'll fetch a rock.”

Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out. But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly;so Tom says:

“I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock. There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too.”

It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it. It warn't quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her half-way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do everything.

Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough. Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. But Tom thought of something, and says:

“You got any spiders in here, Jim?”

“No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom.”

“All right, we'll get you some.”

“But bless you, honey, I doan' want none. I's afeard un um. I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'.”

Tom thought a minute or two, and says:

“It's a good idea. And I reckon it's been done. It must 'a' been done; it stands to reason. Yes, it's a prime good idea. Where could you keep it?”

“Keep what, Mars Tom?”

“Why, a rattlesnake.”

“De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head.”

“Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little. You could tame it.”

“Tame it!”

“Yes—easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting, and they wouldn't think of hurting a person that pets them. Any book will tell you that. You try—that's all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so in a little while that he'll love you; and sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth.”

“Please, Mars Tom—doan' talk so! I can't stan' it! He'd let me shove his head in my mouf—fer a favor, hain't it? I lay he'd wait a pow'ful long time 'fo' I ast him. En mo' en dat, I doan' want him to sleep wid me.”

“Jim, don't act so foolish. A prisoner's got to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life.”

“Why, Mars Tom, I doan' want no sich glory. Snake take 'n bite Jim's chin off, den whah is de glory? No, sah, I doan' want no sich doin's.”

“Blame it, can't you try? I only want you to try—you needn't keep it up if it don't work.”

“But de trouble all done ef de snake bite me while I's a-tryin' him. Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos'anything' at ain't onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I's gwyne to leave, dat's shore.”

“Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bullheaded about it. We can get you some garter snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that'll have to do.”

“I k'n stan' dem, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn't get along widout um, I tell you dat. I never knowed b'fo' 'twas so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner.”

“Well, it always is when it's done right. You got any rats around here?”

“No, sah, I hain't seed none.”

“Well, we'll get you some rats.”

“Why, Mars Tom, I doan' want no rats. Dey's de dadblamedest creturs to 'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he's tryin' to sleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g'yarter snakes, 'f I's got to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um, skasely.”

“But Jim, you got to have 'em—they all do. So don't make no more fuss about it. Prisoners ain't ever without rats. There ain't no instance of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got to play music to them. You got anything to play music on?”

“I ain' got nuffin but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice harp; but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice harp.”

“Yes they would. They don't care what kind of music 'tis. A jew's harp's plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music—in a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can't get no other kind out of a jew's harp. It always interests them; they come out to see what's the matter with you. Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jew's harp; play ‘The Last Link is Broken'—that's the thing that'll scoop a rat quicker'n anything else;and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.”

“Yes, dey will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is Jim havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I'll do it ef I got to. I reck'n I better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.”

Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else;and pretty soon he says:

“Oh, there's one thing I forgot. Could you raise a flower here, do you reckon?”

“I doan' know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah, en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight o' trouble.”

“Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.”

“One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen stalks would grow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss.”

“Don't you believe it. We'll fetch you a little one, and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it. And don't call it mullen, call it Pitchiola—that's its right name when it's in a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.”

“Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.”

“You don't want spring water; you want to water it with your tears. It's the way they always do.”

“Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man's a start'n one wid tears.”

“That ain't the idea. You got to do it with tears.”

“She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skasely ever cry.”

So Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's coffeepot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee”; and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jew's-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.





Chapter XXXIX


In the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap and fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat hole, and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed. But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock. I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.

We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's nest, but we didn't. The family was at home. We didn't give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right again, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was suppertime, and a rattling good honest day's work: and hungry? —oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back—we didn't half tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want them. Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out. I never see such a woman. And you could hear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes created. Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings. It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so. He said they was made that way for some reason or other.

We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them. I didn't mind the lickings, because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and all the other things;and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn't like the spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because they never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place, the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not for a salary.

Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape. The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a line in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone; the bed leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us a most amazing stomachache. We reckoned we was all going to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same. But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.

“What's them?” I says.

“Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done one way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it. It's a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters. We'll use them both. And it's usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We'll do that, too.”

“But looky here, Tom, what do we want to warn anybody for that something's up? Let them find it out for themselves—it's their lookout.”

“Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've acted from the very start—left us to do everything. They're so confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all. So if we don't give them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape'll go off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing—won't be nothing to it.”

“Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.”

“Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:

“But I ain't going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?”

“You'll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that yaller girl's frock.”

“Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she prob'bly hain't got any but that one.”

“I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.”

“All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs.”

“You wouldn't look like a servant-girl then, would you?”

“No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, anyway.”

“That ain't got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is just to do our duty, and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not. Hain't you got no principle at all?”

“All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. Who's Jim's mother?”

“I'm his mother. I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.”

“Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.”

“Not much. I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take nigger woman's gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together. When a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. It's always called so when a king escapes, f'r instance. And the same with a king's son; it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one.”

So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tom told me to. It said:





Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout.

Unknown Friend.





Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They couldn't 'a' been worse scared if the place had 'a' been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch!” if anything fell, she jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened to touch her, when she warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face no way and be satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every time—so she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying “ouch,” and before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up. So the thing was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.

So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down the lightning rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep, and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter said:





Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desperate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger tonight, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang, but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards, along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. Don't do anything but just the way I am telling you; if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing.

Unknown Friend.





Chapter XL


We was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a word about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half upstairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about half past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch, but says:

“Where's the butter?”

“I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a corn pone.”

“Well, you left it laid out, then—it ain't here.”

“We can get along without it,” I says.

“We can get along with it, too,” he says; “just you slide down cellar and fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning rod and come along. I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to ba like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.”

So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started upstairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:

“You been down cellar?”

“Yes'm.”

“What you been doing down there?”

“Noth'n.”

“Noth'n!”

“No'm.”

“Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?”

“I don't know'm.”

“You don't know? Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what you been doing down there.”

“I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I have.”

I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would;but I s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says, very decided:

“You just march into that sitting-room and stay there till I come. You been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it is before I'm done with you.”

So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room. My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn't easy myself, but I didn't take my hat off, all the same.

I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet's nest we'd got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.

At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I couldn't answer them straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears;and pretty soon, when one of them says, “I'm for going and getting in the cabin first and right now, and catching them when they come,” I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:

“For the land's sake, what is the matter with the child? He's got the brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!”

And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me, and says:

“Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain't no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours, and when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if—Dear, dear, whyd'nt you tell me that was what you'd been down there for, I wouldn't 'a' cared. Now cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of you till morning!”

I was upstairs in a second, and down the lightning rod in another one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn't hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose—the house full of men, yonder, with guns!

His eyes just blazed; and he says:

“No! —is that so? Ain't it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till—”

“Hurry! Hurry!” I says. “Where's Jim?”

“Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him. He's dressed, and everything's ready. Now we'll slide out and give the sheep signal.”

But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them begin to fumble with the padlock, and heard a man say:

“I told you we'd be too soon; they haven't come—the door is locked. Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear 'em coming.”

So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all right, and out through the hole, swift but soft—Jim first, me next, and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders. Now we was in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it;but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped on our tracks and started somebody sings out:

“Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!”

But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then there was a rush, and a bang, bang, bang! and the bullets fairly whizzed around us! We heard them sing out:

“Here they are! They've broke for the river! after 'em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!”

So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell. We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close onto us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them. They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers;but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering; and then we upsteam again, and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. And when we stepped onto the raft I says:

“Now, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a slave no more.”

“En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It 'uz planned beautiful, en it 'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't nobody kin git up a plan dat's mo' mixed up en splendid den what dat one wuz.”

We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.

When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel as brash as what we did before. It was hurting him considerble, and bleeding; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but he says:

“Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don't stop now; don't fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set her loose! Boys, we done it elegant! —'deed we did. I wish we'd 'a' had the handling of Louis XVI, there wouldn't 'a' been no 'Son of Saint Louis, ascend to heaven! ' wrote down in his biography;no, sir, we'd 'a' whooped him over the border—that's what we'd 'a' done with him—and done it just as slick as nothing at all, too. Man the sweeps—man the sweeps!”

But me and Jim was consulting—and thinking. And after we'd thought a minute, I says:

“Say it, Jim.”

So he says:

“Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz him dat'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one'? Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You bet he wouldn't! Well, den, is Jim gwyne to say it? No, sah—I doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a doctor; not if it's forty year!”

I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say—so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor. He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn't do no good.

So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:

“Well, then, if you're bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe, in a round-about way amongst the islands, and search him and take his chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again. It's the way they all do.”

So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again.





Chapter XLI


The doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about midnight he must 'a' kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks.

“Who is your folks?” he says.

“The Phelpses, down yonder.”

“Oh,” he says. And after a minute, he says: “How'd you say he got shot?”

“He had a dream,” I says, “And it shot him.”

“Singular dream,” he says.

So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddlebags, and we started. But when he see the canoe he didn't like the look of her—said she was big enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two. I says:

“Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy enough.”

“What three?”

“Why, me and Sid, and—and—the guns; that's what I mean.”

“Oh,” he says.

But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one. But they was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.

I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is? spos'n it takes him three or four days? What are we going to do? —lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; I know what I'll do. I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get ashore.

So then I crept into a lumber pile to get some sleep; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for the doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time or other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off. So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's stomach! He says:

“Why, Tom! Where you been all this time, you rascal?”

“I hain't been nowheres,” I says, “only just hunting for the runaway nigger—me and Sid.”

“Why, where ever did you go?” he says. “Your aunt's been mighty uneasy.”

“She needn't,” I says, “because we was all right. We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along upshore till we get kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post office to see what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us, and then we're going home.”

So then we went to the post office to get “Sid”; but just as I suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done fooling around—but we would ride. I couldn't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.

When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.

And the place was plumb full of farmers and farmers' wives to dinner; and such another clack a body never heard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time. She says:

“Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve the nigger was crazy. I says to Sister Damrell—didn't I, Sister Damrell? —s'I, he's crazy, s'I—them's the very words I said. You all hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I. Look at that-air grindstone, s'I; want to tell me't any cretur 't's in his right mind's a-goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone? s'I. Here sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' so pegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that—natcherl son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'n rubbage. He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what I says last 'n' all the time—the nigger's crazy—crazy's Nebokoodneezer, s'I.”

“An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss,” says old Mrs. Damrell; “what in the name o' goodness could he ever want of—”

“The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself. Sh-she, look at that-air rag ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, look at it, s'I—what could he 'a' wanted of it? s'I. Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she—”

“But how in the nation'd they ever git that grindstone in there, anyway? 'n' who dug that-air hole? 'n' who—”

“My very words, Brer Penrod! I was a-sayin'—pass that-air sasser o' m'lasses, won't ye? —I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how did they git that grindstone in there? s'I. Without help, mind you—'thout help! Thar's where 'tis. Don't tell me, s'I; there wuz help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a plenty help, too, s'I; ther's ben a dozen a-helpin' that nigger, ’n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on this place but I'd find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I—”

“A dozen says you! —forty couldn't 'a' done everything that's been done. Look at them case knife saws and things, how tedious they've been made; look at that bed leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men; look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at—”

“You may well say it, Brer Hightower! It's jist as I was a-sayin' to Brer Phelps, his own self. S'e, what do you think of it, Sister Hotchkiss? s'e, Think o' what, Brer Phelps? s'I. Think o' that bed leg sawed off that a way? s'e. Think of it? s'I. I lay it never sawed itself off, s'I—somebody sawed it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it or leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my opinion, s'I, 'n' if anybody k'n start a better one, s'I, let him do it, s'I, that's all. I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I—”

“Why, dog my cats, they must 'a' ben a housefull o' niggers in there every night for four weeks to 'a' done all that work, Sister Phelps. Look at that shirt—every last inch of it kivered over with secret African writ'n done with blood! Must 'a' ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, all the time, amost. Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n' as for the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll—”

“People to help him, Brother Marples! Well, I reckon you'd think so if you'd 'a' been in this house for awhile back. Why, they've stole everything they could lay their hands on—and we a-watching all the time, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how many times they didn't steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks, and spoons, and the old warming pan, and most a thousand things that I disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tom on the constant watch day and night, as I was a-telling you, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under our noses and fools us, and not only fools us but the Injun Territory robbers too, and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time! I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever heard of. Why, sperits couldn't 'a' done better and been no smarter. And I reckon they must 'a' been sperits—because, you know our dogs, and ther' ain't no better; well, them dogs never even got on the track of 'm once! You explain that to me if you can! —any of you!”

“Well, it does beat—”

“Laws alive, I never—”

“So help me, I wouldn't 'a' be—”

“House thieves as well as—”

“Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd 'a' ben afeard to live in sich a—”

“'Fraid to live! —why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or set down, Sister Ridgeway. Why, they'd steal the very—why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was in by the time midnight come last night. I hope to gracious if I warn't afraid they'd steal some o' the family! I was just to that pass I didn't have no reasoning faculties no more. It looks foolish enough now, in the daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys asleep, ’way upstairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep' up there and locked 'em in! I did. And anybody would. Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things, and by and by you think to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain't locked, and you—” She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on me—I got up and took a walk.

Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little. So I done it. But I dasn't go fur, or she'd 'a' sent for me. And when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,” and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try that no more. And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before;and then she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done. So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:

“Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet! What has become of that boy?”

I see my chance; so I skips up and says:

“I'll run right up to town and get him,” I says.

“No you won't,” she says. “You'll stay right wher' you are; one's enough to be lost at a time. If he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll go.”

Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.

He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's track. Aunt Sally was a good deal uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn't no occasion to be—boys will be boys, he said, and you'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right. So she had to be satisfied. But she said she'd set up for him awhile anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it.

And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could 'a' got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much trouble. And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle, and says:

“The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and the rod; but you'll be good, won't you? And you won't go? For my sake.”

Laws knows I wanted to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all intending to go; but after that I wouldn't 'a' went, not for kingdoms.

But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless. And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hands, and she was asleep.





Chapter XLII


The old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything. And by and by the old man says:

“Did I give you the letter?”

“What letter?”

“The one I got yesterday out of the post office.”

“No, you didn't give me no letter.”

“Well, I must 'a' forgot it.”

So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:

“Why, it's from St. Petersburg—it's from Sis.”

I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir. But before she could break it open she dropped it and run—for she see something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in her calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:

“Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!”

And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other, which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and says:

“He's alive, thank God! And that's enough!” and she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way.

I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim;and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others said, don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled them down a little, because the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him.

They cussed Jim considerable, though, and give him a cuff or two side the head once in awhile, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn't come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-by cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says:

“Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't a bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have help somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I was! and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course, I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning;and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuler, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would 'a' done at home—better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I was, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I think about him.”

Somebody says:

“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say.”

Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.

Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water;but they didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but I judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me—explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.

But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sickroom all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.

Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sickroom, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for him to wake. In about a half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuler all the time, and ten to one he'd wake up in his right mind.

So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opens his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:

“Hello! —why, I'm at home! How's that? Where's the raft?”

“It's all right,” I says.

“And Jim?”

“The same,” I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash. But he never noticed, but says:

“Good! Splendid! Now we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?”

I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:

“About what, Sid?”

“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”

“What whole thing?”

“Why, the whole thing. There ain't but one; how we set the runaway nigger free—me and Tom.”

“Good land! Set the run—What is the child talking about! Dear, dear, out of his head again!”

“No, I ain't out of my HEAD; I know all what I'm talking about. We did set him free—me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we done it.And we done it elegant, too.” He'd got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn't no use for me to put in. “Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case knives, and the warming pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can't think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can't think half the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and make the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket—”

“Mercy sakes!”

“—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and wasn't it bully, Aunty!”

“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was you, you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble, and turned everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death. I've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o' you this very minute. To think, here I've been, night after night, a—you just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out o' both o' ye!”

But Tom, he was so proud and joyful, he just couldn't hold in, and his tongue just went it—she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says:

“Well, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now, for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again—”

“Meddling with who?” Tom says, dropping his smile and looking surprised.

“With who? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who'd you reckon?”

Tom looks at me very grave, and says:

“Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right? Hasn't he got away?”

“Him?” says Aunt Sally; “The runaway nigger? 'Deed he hasn't. They've got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or sold!”

Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:

“They hain't no right to shut him up! Shove! —and don't you lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur that walks this earth!”

“What does the child mean?”

“I mean every word I say, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, I'll go. I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river, and said so; and she set him free in her will.”

“Then what on earth did you want to set him free for, seeing he was already free?”

“Well, that is a question, I must say; and just like women! Why, I wanted the adventure of it; and I'd 'a' waded neck-deep in blood to—goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!”

If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!

Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles—kind of grinding him into the earth, you know. And then she says:

“Yes, you better turn y'r head away—I would if I was you, Tom.”

“Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally, “is he changed so? Why, that ain't Tom, it's Sid; Tom's—Tom's—why, where is Tom? He was here a minute ago.”

“You mean where's Huck Finn—that's what you mean! I reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I see him. That would be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn.”

So I done it. But not feeling brash.

Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see—except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn't 'a' understood it. So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer—she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it now, and 'taint no need to change”—that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it—there warn't no other way, and I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he'd make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.

And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he could help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.

Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and Sid had come all right and safe, she says to herself:

“Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur's up to this time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer out of you about it.”

“Why, I never heard nothing from you,” says Aunt Sally.

“Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here.”

“Well, I never got 'em, Sis.”

Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:

“You, Tom!”

“Well—what?” he says, kind of pettish.

“Don't you what me, you impudent thing—hand out them letters.”

“What letters?”

“Them letters. I be bound, if I have to take-a-holt of you I'll—”

“They're in the trunk. There, now. And they're just the same as they was when I got them out of the office. I hain't looked into them, I hain't touched them. But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if you warn't in no hurry, I'd—”

“Well, you do need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it. And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he—”

“No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but it's all right, I've got that one.”

I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.





Chapter The Last


The first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time of the evasion? —what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we. But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.

We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had him up to the sickroom, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:

“Dah, now, Huck, what I tell you? —what I tell you up dah on Jackson Islan'? I tole you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it;en I tole you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter be rich ag'in; en it's come true; en heah she is! Dab, now! doan' talk to me—signs is signs, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be rich ag'in as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!”

And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the territory, for a couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get none from home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.

“No, he hain't,” Tom says; “It's all there yet—six thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain't ever been back since. Hadn't when I come away, anyhow.”

Jim says, kind of solemn:

“He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck.”

I says:

“Why, Jim?”

“Nemmine why, Huck—but he ain't comin' back no mo'.”

But I kept at him; so at last he says:

“Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn't let you come in? Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase dat wuz him.”

Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd 'a' knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't 'a' tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more. But I reckon I got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.
