献给日内瓦共和国的致辞(1)


尊贵的、光荣的、至高无上的执政者们：

我坚信祖国只接受高尚的公民呈上的敬礼，因此，在过去的三十年里，我努力工作，以使自己获得这种荣幸，向您表达崇敬之情。这种荣幸在某种程度上弥补了我的努力未达之处。我向来认为，是我内心的热情而不是权力赋予我这种荣幸。我有幸出生在这里，以致在我思考自然赋予人们的平等和人们所创造的不平等之时，而不至于忽视其最高的智慧：在这个国家，这两者完美地结合，配合默契，以最符合自然法则和最有利于社会的方式来维护公共秩序和保障人民福祉。在我研究了良知能为政府建制提供的最优法则之后，我震惊于这一切都已经发生在你们的国家里。即使我没有生活在这里，我仍会觉得有必要把我描绘的这幅人类社会的图景献给你们，因为你们的政府已经拥有所有其他政府已经有的那些优点，同时又巧妙地避开了它们的弊端。

如果我能选择我的出生地，我会选择这样一个国家，它的面积和人们的智力相称，这样更有可能治理得好。在这里，每个人都能胜任自己的工作，没有人需要将自己的职责托付于他人；在这里，人们彼此熟悉，无论是密谋犯罪还是谦恭美德都逃不过人们的检视和裁决。彼此相知的那种愉悦风气使得人们将热爱公民而不是热爱领土当作爱国。

我愿出生在这样一个国家，在这里，执政者和人民的利益是一致的，这样，一切政府行为都致力于为公众谋幸福，而这只有在执政者是人民的情况下才会出现。因此我希望生活在英明的民主政府管理之下。

我愿自由而生，自由而死。这意味着，每个人都遵纪守法，无论是我还是其他任何人，都甘愿受这种光荣的约束。这种舒适且有益的约束，即使是最高贵的人也甘愿加之于己身，因为除此之外，他们无须再受任何其他的束缚。

我愿，在这个国家内部，没有人能够凌驾于法律之上；在国家外部，也没有人能够做出命令使这个国家承认他的权威。因为，无论一个政府因何而设，在它的管辖范围内，如果有人不受法律约束，那么其他所有人必然会受这个人的任意支配。如果国内有一个统治者，国外也有一个统治者(2)，那么无论他们如何分配权力，也不可能得到合适的服从，国家也不能得到很好的治理。

我不愿选择一个新成立的共和国，不管它的法律有多么完善。新的政府要么可能不符合当时的环境所需，要么可能与它的新公民不相容，又或者，公民对它不满意，国家要冒着刚一成立就发生动荡或者被毁灭的危险。因为，自由正像那些营养丰富的食物和醇酒一样，对于适应它们的强壮的人来说，可以增加他们的营养，强健他们的体魄，但是对于那些不适合它们的体质虚弱的人，就会摧毁他们的身体或者使他们沉醉。人们一旦适应了主人就很难离开他们，即使他们挣开枷锁，也只会离自由更远，因为他们错误地把与奴役对立的那种过度的放纵当作自由，这样在革命之后，他们往往耽于享乐，最终几乎都将命运交给那些只会加重他们锁链的引诱者。即便是罗马人(3)——他们曾是自由民族的榜样——在脱离了塔尔干王朝的统治之后也没有自治的能力(4)。由于奴隶制的压迫，和塔尔干王朝强加在他们身上的繁重劳役，他们最初也只不过是一群暴民。只有最伟大的智慧才能管治他们，使那些曾在暴政下磨灭意志甚至变得冷酷无情的人，渐渐习惯于呼吸健康的自由空气，逐渐形成严格的道德约束，培养英勇的精神，最终成为令人敬仰的民族。我愿为自己选择一个宁静而幸福的祖国，它所有的陈腐制度在久远的历史中消磨殆尽：它所经历的动乱有助于显示和加强人民的英勇和爱国之情；它的所有公民，由于长期习惯于独立决断，不仅是自由的，而且值得拥有自由。

我愿为自己选择这样一个国家，它的幸运之处在于它并不强大，以避免产生残酷的征服欲望；同时它更幸运地处于这样一种地位，得以摆脱被别国征服的担忧。它自由地生存于几个国家之间，没有哪个国家会有兴趣侵犯它，相反，每个国家都有兴趣保护它免受其他国家的侵犯。简言之，这个共和国引不起邻国征服的野心，却能在需要时合理地得到它们的援助。这样，这个共和国便能安然度日，除了自身的发展之外没有其他的担忧。即使人们操练武器，也只是为了保持自由人所应拥有的英勇精神，和保持他们追求自由的品格，而不是因为有保家卫国的需要。

我愿选择这样一个国家，在这里，立法权属于所有公民，因为，谁能比他们更清楚在怎样的条件下他们才能够在一个国家里更好地共同生活呢？这并不是说我主张实行罗马的那种全民投票，在那个国家，反而是执政者和有志于保卫国家的人被排斥于制定防卫政策的会议之外，并且由于种种荒唐的矛盾政策，地方法官反而不能享有普通人的基本权利(5)。

与之相反，我认为，为了防止谋取私利和考虑欠周的政策，以及最终毁掉雅典的种种危险的革新，不是每个人都可以随意提出法律；提出法律的权力应该为地方法官所专有。地方法官在提出法律时应慎之又慎，人民认可法律时应三思而行，在法律公布之时还应该郑重其事。那么，在国家被新法搅乱之前，人们就有足够的时间来确信，现有的法律不只是因为历史悠久才具有神圣性，为人们所尊崇。人们很快就学会鄙视那些朝令夕改的法律，而政府，一旦放纵自己以改革为借口无视旧制，往往会因小失大。

我应特别避免一个治理混乱的国家，在这种共和国中，人们相信他们不需要官员，或者只给官员一些不确定的权力，而由他们自己轻率地管理国内事务，执掌法律。这也许就是刚刚从自然状态脱离出来的原始政府的粗糙建制，这也是雅典共和国衰落的另一个原因(6)。

我愿选择这样一个国家，人们乐于有权批准法律，他们在执政官的提议下，集体商讨重大的公共事务，建立高贵的法庭，仔细划分行政区域，每年都选举最有才干、最正直的公民来掌管司法和治理国家。简言之，在这个国家里，法官身上体现着公民的智慧，每个阶层都互相尊重。即使发生重大误解，扰乱了公众的平静，人们在盲目和错误中，也能保持节制，依然相互尊重，遵纪守法。这标志着并保证了永远有诚心实意的和解。尊贵的、光荣的、至高无上的执政者们，这就是我愿之成为出生地的那个国家的美好景象，如果上帝再为这个国家增添愉悦的环境，赋予它以温和的气候、肥沃的土壤以及人世间最美的乡间景色，我将在祖国的怀抱里度过我的幸福人生，享受天赐的宁静幸福；和我的同胞们在这个美好的国度里和平共处，以他们为榜样，来践行友谊、仁爱等一切美德，在我死后就可以落得一个善良、正直、有道德的爱国者的美名(7)。

然而，或许是我不够幸运，或许是我明理太晚，以致沦落到异国他乡，在动荡不安中煎熬度日，空自追悔那些因年轻时轻率鲁莽而失去的宁静生活(8)。尽管没有机会在祖国享受这一切，至少在我的内心深处还蕴藏着这种感情。我的同胞们，怀着对你们温柔、无私的爱，我将这些发自肺腑的话说出来献给你们：

“我亲爱的同胞们，我亲爱的兄弟们，由于血统和法律使我们紧密相连，所以令我感到欣慰的是，在我想到你们的时候，我不能不想到你们所享有的一切幸福。你们中的任何一个人都不可能感受得到我在失去这些幸福时的痛苦。我越多地思考你们的政治和国家，我就越难以想象还有更为美好的人类社会的图景。在其他国家，每当涉及保障国家最大福祉的问题时，讨论的结果都只不过是计划和设想，至多不过是讨论可能性而已。至于你们，拥有那么多的幸福，除了享受无须做其他的事；如果你们能够满足于自己的幸福，那就是最完美的幸福了。你们以武力获得或者收回的主权，已经由你们的智慧和勇敢延续了两个世纪，并最终得到人们的普遍认可。公正的条约为你们保障了稳定的边疆、不可侵犯的主权以及国家的安全。你们卓越的宪法，建立在最高的智慧之上，并由伟大而友善的军队保护着。你们的国家享有安宁，你们无须惧怕任何战争和任何征服者，你们唯一的主人就是你们自己制定的法律，并且这些法律由你们所选出的正直的法官来掌管。你们不致太富有，以致耽于享乐而丧失活力，也不会为追求浅薄的快乐而丧失真正的美德和幸福；你们也没有贫穷到国内生产不能自给，以致需要向外国寻求支援。这种珍贵的自由，在大国家里只能以最沉重的劳役来维持，而你们却几乎无须付出代价。

“这样的一个共和国，它组织得多么合理，多么完善，为了做其他民族的典范，为了它子民的福祉，但愿它永存于世！这是你们唯一需要祈祷的，也是唯一需要为此奋斗的。此后，唯有依靠你们（不是去创造幸福，因为你们的祖辈已经为你们创造了幸福）保持幸福的智慧才能使幸福得以延续。只有依靠你们的团结，你们对法律的遵守和对执政官的爱戴，才能使国家长存。如果你们中间还存在些微的痛苦或者猜疑，一定要及时摧毁它，否则它迟早会成为引起国家灭亡的导火索。我恳请你们检视自己的内心，聆听良知的声音，你们之中有谁能够在这个世界上找到一个比你们的执政官更正直、更开明、更值得尊敬的人吗？难道不是他们为你们树立了节制、简朴、尊重法律、诚实和蔼的榜样吗？因此，你们应当毫无保留地相信你们的执政官，这种有益的信任是理智的人们应当给予有德行的人的。设想一下，既然你们自己选出了他们，而他们也证明了你们的选择是对的，那么，你们所拥戴的人所享有的荣誉也必然都是你们自己的荣誉。你们每个人都应明白，一旦法律失去效力，它的捍卫者失去权威，那么安全和自由也就不复存在了。既然如此，你们还有什么可犹豫的呢？带上你们的热情和自信，为了权利、职责和真理，去做那些你们从始至终一直在做的事情吧！

“不要让那种对维护宪法有害而罪恶的冷漠占据你们的心灵，它会使你们在需要的时候忽视了你们之中最明智最热诚的人提出的远见卓识，一定要让平等、节制和坚强的意志继续指导你们的一切行动，向全世界展示一个既勇敢又谦恭、既热爱名誉又热爱自由的民族典范。我给你们的最后一个忠告是，你们要特别提防不怀好意的曲解和恶毒的谣言，因为这种险恶的用心往往比在它支配下的行动更可怕。一个值得信赖的看门狗，只在强盗来临的时候才会叫喊，使全家人惊醒，并及时戒备；然而我们讨厌乱叫的狗，它狂吠不止，使人们不得安宁，它不合时宜的叫声往往导致我们在需要时听不到任何警报。”

你们，尊敬的、光荣的执政者们！值得被一个自由的民族尊敬的长官们！请允许我专诚向你们献上我的忠诚和敬意。如果这个世界上有一种地位，能使处于这个地位上的人获得至高无上的荣耀，它将毫无疑问地被授予德才兼备的人，而你们是当之无愧的，因为是你们的人民将你们推举到这个位置上的。他们的荣耀使你们大放异彩，因为你们是由一个能够领导其他民族的人民选出来领导他们自己的，因而我认为你们优于任何其他政府的官员，这正像一个自由民族，尤其是你们所领导的那个民族，他们以其智慧和理性而优于其他民族。

请允许我举一个例子，这是一个美好的回忆，经常浮现在我的脑海里。每当想起那个品德高尚的公民，我的内心总是充满了甜蜜的感情，是他给予我生命，并且在我童年时教导我要尊敬你们。我似乎又看到他在那里，用双手的劳动来养活自己，用崇高的真理来滋养心灵。塔西佗、普鲁塔克和格劳秀斯(9)的著作和他用以谋生的工具都杂陈在他面前(10)。站在他身边的那个孩子，聆听着慈爱父亲的谆谆教导，可惜获益不多。尽管由于年轻无知，我曾一度忘记了父亲的教诲，但我最终还是欣慰地发现，不管一个人沾染上何种恶习，他都不能轻易将那种充满爱意的教诲完全抛弃。

尊敬的、光荣的执政者们，这就是你们领导下的公民，甚至是最普通的居民。他们富有学识，通情达理，然而在其他国家，他们被称为工匠或者平民，人们错误地对他们怀有一种鄙视之情。我愉快地承认，我父亲在他的同胞中并不突出，他仅仅是他们中间普普通通的一个。然而就是这样的一个普通人，在他的国家里，人们都乐于和他交往，即使是最高尚的人也能在这种交往中获益。感谢上天！其实轮不到我，也无须我来提醒你们，这样的人是值得他们的长官尊敬的，他们接受了同等的教育，享受到平等的自然权利，并生而平等。然而，由于他们自己的意愿，以及对你们美德的认可，才使得他们拥戴你们，甘受你们领导，当然也应得你们的感激。我对你们的做法非常满意，你们作为严肃的执政官，在对待公民的时候既大公无私又极度谦恭；你们尽心尽力，以极大的尊重和关怀，来回报他们的尊敬和服从；你们公正而谨慎的行为，使得那些应该被遗忘的不幸历史永远从人们的记忆中消失。这些英明的举动，使得这个慷慨公正的民族乐于履行职责，乐于尊敬你们，并且使那些最热衷于维护自己权益的人成为最拥戴你们的人。

文明国度的执政官如果热爱他们社会的荣耀和福祉，这没有任何稀奇之处；然而，如果那些自认为是天国的官员，甚至是天国主人的人，也对供养他们的尘世表现出极大兴趣的话，那显然会给世人带来安宁(11)。然而，我荣幸地发现了唯一的例外，这里的教士有资格与最优秀的公民并列。他们掌管由法律确立的神圣信仰，是人类灵魂的守护者；他们能用有力的话语和雄辩的口才将福音播撒进每个人的灵魂深处，并能率先实践福音意旨。人们都知道，传道的艺术在日内瓦锤炼得多么成功。然而，由于早已习惯了传教士说一套做一套(12)，所以人们很难相信我们的传教士还普遍具有这么纯洁的基督精神，圣洁的品行以及宽以待人、严于律己的高尚道德。也许只有日内瓦才能树立一个牧师和学者完美结合的有教育意义的榜样。我把对国家永久安宁的希望建立在对传教士才智、克己精神和他们对国家繁荣的热诚的衡量之上。同时，我注意到——怀着惊讶、尊敬而又愉快的心情——他们是多么憎恨那些历史上层出不穷的残忍的人所信奉的可怕信条，他们往往打着维护上帝权利的幌子，实际上是为自己谋私利，他们丝毫不在意人类的血，却希望自己的血享有特别的尊敬(13)。

我不会忘记共和国珍贵的另一半，她们为别人带来幸福，并以其温柔和细致维护共和国的安宁和美德。日内瓦的女儿们，你们和蔼可亲、品德高尚，正是你们这些女性，在一直引导着我们。我们是多么幸福啊，因为只有在维护国家荣誉和公众幸福的时候，你们才会运用在家中的纯洁权威。斯巴达正是由女性来引导的(14)，因而，在日内瓦也应该由你们来引导。试问，哪个粗野男人能够抗拒从一个温柔的妻子口中说出的充满荣誉和理性的话语呢？看到你们因简朴节制而焕发出的、似乎是世界上最美的光彩时，谁能不鄙弃奢侈空虚呢？你们的责任就是，用你们纯洁亲切的权威，循循善诱，使我们尊重法律和和睦共处的传统得以永续；用美满的婚姻使离散的亲人得以重聚；最重要的是，你们用甜蜜而又有说服力的言辞和优雅的倾心交谈使得年轻人在别国沾染的恶习得以改正——他们从国外几乎没有带回任何有益的东西，除了从堕落的女人那里学来的轻佻语调和荒唐举止，就只剩下对所谓崇高的艳羡。那些所谓的崇高只不过是对奴隶的毫无价值的补偿罢了，与真正自由的崇高简直不可同日而语。因此，继续前行吧，我们忠诚的道德卫士，自由的甜蜜守护神，一刻不停地使用自然和良知赋予你们的权力，来履行你们的职责，捍卫我们的道德。

值得庆幸的是，我将公民的普遍幸福和共和国的光荣都建立在这样的基础上，并将最终被证明是正确的！必须承认，即使有这么多优点，共和国的光芒也没有使绝大多数人的眼睛感到眩晕，仅仅追求这种光芒不仅是很肤浅的也是有害的，因为这种追求反而是自由和幸福的大敌。

让那些浪荡子弟到别处去追求肤浅的快乐，然后慢慢追悔吧！让妄求者们到别处品评那些宏伟的府邸、华丽的马车、奢侈的陈设、纵情的聚会以及一切奢华的享受去吧！在日内瓦只有自由的人民，这本身就是它的价值，那些追求这些价值的人和追求其他东西的人一样毫不逊色。

尊贵的、光荣的、至高无上的执政者们！我对你们的共同幸福寄予深切的关怀，请屈尊接受我最恭敬的致意！如果因我内心过度兴奋，不小心冒犯到你们，引起你们不愉快的话，请你们务必宽恕我，念及一个爱国者的款款深情，一个热心人的炙热真诚，因为除了看见你们过得幸福，我再也没有更大的快乐了！

尊贵的、光荣的、至高无上的执政者们！谨向你们致以最深切的敬意！

你们最恭顺的仆人和同胞

(5) 这里，卢梭指罗马共和国的部族大会。罗马平民在部族大会中选出保民官，而保民官只有平民才能担任。保民官负责召集部族大会，并参与立法，而元老院则不能参加这种大会，因而，“在这方面，就要比一个最卑微的公民还更少自由。”引自《社会契约论》（何兆武），第四卷第四章。本书所引《社会契约论》皆引自何兆武译本，商务印书馆，2003年。

(15) 《忏悔录》（第二部）中写道：“在离开巴黎以前，我已经把《论不平等》那篇文章的献词草拟好了。我把这篇献词在尚贝里写完，就注明某年月日写于尚贝里，因为我想，为着避免一切挑剔，还是宁可不注明写于法兰西或写于日内瓦为好。”（范希衡译，徐继曾校，商务印书馆，1986年）在写完这篇论文之后，卢梭回到日内瓦受到了热烈的欢迎。





序言


在人类所有的知识中，我认为最有用却又最不完善的就是关于“人”的知识。我敢说德尔菲神庙上的那句铭文(1)比任何伦理家们的鸿篇巨制都更深奥、更重要。后文将要论述的这个问题，在我看来，是哲学所能提出的最有意思的问题之一，不幸的是，这也是哲学家不得不解决的最棘手的问题之一。因为，如果不从了解人类自身开始，我们如何能够了解人与人之间不平等的起源呢？人类在时空的流转中一定发生了许多变化，如果不了解这些变化，人类怎能希望看到自然创造的人的最初模样呢？人类又如何能够区分哪些是人类原初的本性，哪些是人类由于环境和人的进步带来以改变自身原始状态的那些变化呢？像格劳克斯(2)石像一样，在经过岁月、海浪和暴风雨的无数次侵袭之后，看起来更像是一只野兽，而不像一位天神；人的心灵也是如此。在经受无数次持续不断的改变之后，在接受了不计其数的真理和谬误之后，在身体构造发生重大改变之后，在遭受长期的激情的冲撞之后，人的心灵已经面目全非了，几乎再也不能从中识别出它的原始本性。现在我们再也看不到哪个人自始至终坚持一种行为模式了，再也不能看到哪个人还保留着伟大的造物主赐予他的崇高而庄严的淳朴本性，我们看到的是人们仅剩下过度情欲和昏庸无知之间的可怕交锋。

更糟糕的是，人类每前进一步，他与原始状态的距离就更远一些；我们掌握的知识越多，我们就丢掉了更多的发现重大问题的工具。在这种意义上，人类越是研究，就越不能了解自身。

显而易见的是，我们必须从人类体质的持续变化中寻找人类差别的根源。人们都知道，人与人之间原本是平等的，正如各种动物，在生理因素还没有导致其中一些动物发生我们能看到的种种变化之前，它们也是平等的。

事实上，无论那些变化最初是怎样发生的，人类的所有个体都不可能在同一时间以同样的方式发生变化。这自然让我们想到，一些人的处境好转或者恶化，他们就获得或好或坏的品质，而另外一些人则长期保留着他们的原始秉性。这无疑就是人类不平等最初的源头了。然而，仅用一句话概括出来是很容易的，要确切说明真正原因却并非易事。

尽管如此，我希望读者不会因此认为我在自吹自擂，自认为解决了那个对于我来说也很困难的问题。我仅仅是引入了一些论据，并据此大胆猜想，与其说是为了解决问题，不如说是为了让问题变得更明了，或者让问题恢复到本来的面目。也许别人能轻而易举地在这条路上走得更远，但是谁都不会轻易到达终点。因为我们无从正确地识别，在人类的真实本性中，哪些是原始的，哪些是后来发展的；我们也无从正确把握一个不再存在、也许从来没有存在过、将来也可能永远不会存在的状态。然而，只有把握这种状态，我们才能对人类的现状做出正确判断。要对这个问题进行深入研究，那势必需要高深莫测的哲学来精确指导我们应该为这种研究做哪些准备。在我看来，如果能有人圆满解答下面的问题，他就值得被称为当代的亚里士多德和普林尼(3)：为了了解自然人，需要做什么样的实验？又如何在社会中进行这些实验呢？

我致力于解决这个问题已经很久了，而在充分思考这个问题之后，我敢在进入正文之前这样说：即使是我们最伟大的哲学家也无力主持这些实验，即使是我们最强大的统治者也不会进行这些实验。我们根本不应该指望他们能够合作进行实验，更不必说，为了实验成功，他们还必须具有坚忍的精神，付出极大的智慧和辅以慈悲的情怀。

这些实验尽管难以实施并因此很少有人进行，但它们却是能够扫清重重迷雾的唯一方法，正是这重重迷雾遮蔽了我们的双眼，使我们无法认清人类社会的真正基础。由于忽视对人类本性的研究，我们难以确定自然权利的真正含义，或者界定得模糊不清。因为，正如布尔马拉奇所言，权利的概念，尤其是自然权利的概念，显然与人类的本性密切相关。他还说，我们应该从人类本性、人的体质和人的生存状态出发来演绎这门科学的最初原理(4)。

我们不无惊愕地发现，学者们在这个重大问题上存在着多么大的分歧！在较权威的著述家那里，几乎没有哪两个人持有相同的观点。这里也不用说那些古代的哲学家了，他们似乎不遗余力地在最根本的原则上相互抨击。罗马法理学家把人和动物不加区别地归于自然法则之下。他们认为自然法则这个词与其说是自然为他物制定的法则，不如说是自然施加给自身的法则。或者说，法理学家仅仅是在特殊的意义上理解法则这个词的。似乎在这种情况下，他们仅将自然法则理解为自然界所有生命体为共同生活而建立的普遍关系。而现代学者认为，法则仅仅存在于有道德的生物当中，即有智慧、有自由意志并且相互关联的人类当中，他们因此认为自然法则仅适用于人类。然而每个学者都根据自己的方式在极其形而上学的原则下给法则下定义使得我们中间几乎没人能理解这些形而上学的原则，更不用说去自己发现它们了。这些学问家每个人给法则下的定义都不同于其他人，莫衷一是，但却在同一个问题上达成一致：他们都认为，要么是刁钻的诡辩家，要么是深刻的哲学家，否则便无法理解自然法则，也就更无从遵守了。所有这些都说明人类是以某种能力创造社会的，这种能力，即使在社会状态中，也是在历经坎坷艰辛之后由少数人获得的。

由于对自然知之甚少，又在法则的含义上产生重大分歧，我们很难给自然法则下一个好定义。我们能在书本上看到的种种定义，除了存在着意见不合的缺陷外，还有另外一个重大缺陷：它们都忽视了自然状态中的人类并不具有各种知识，同时，他们也没有注意到人类直到脱离了自然状态之后才拥有思想。现代著述者从追问人类最初为了共同利益而做出了哪些法则开始，然后将这些法则汇集在一起，就得到了自然法则。他们唯一的证据就是人们在共同实践这些法则时可能带来的好处。这无疑是下定义的一个简便方法，但却几乎是全凭主观臆断来解释事物的性质。

只要我们还对自然状态的人一无所知，任何企图了解人类最初法则或者了解人类最佳的生存状态的努力都将是白费力气的。关于自然法则，我们唯一清楚的就是，要成为一种法则，它必须能使它约束的对象自觉服从它，并且，作为自然法则，它必须是直接源于自然的召唤。

因此，抛开所有这些科学书本——它们仅仅教我们认识那已经完成自我创造的人类——来思考一下人类心灵最初最简单的活动。我相信我找到了早于理智而存在于自然人身上的两个法则，第一个法则源于人类对自身幸福和生存的深切关注，第二个是在人类看到其他有知觉的生物，尤其是他的同类，在遭受痛苦和死亡时所感觉到的那种天然的不愉快。在我看来，这两种法则的统一和协调是所有自然权利法则的来源，稍加理解即可建立这两条原则之间的这种联系，无须引入社会性。在随后的不断发展中，理智逐渐发展并最终压抑自然本性，将这些法则改建在其他的基础之上。

在这个过程中，在人还未成为人的时候，我们不应该将人视为哲学家。人类对他人尽责并非因为后天的教育使然，只要他不抗拒同情心的自然冲动，他就绝不会伤害任何其他人，甚至任何有知觉的生物，除非在正当的情况下，出于安全的考虑，他才不得不伤害别人以保护自己。由此，我们也可以结束是否要将动物纳入自然法则的这场旷日持久的争论，因为很明显，由于它们没有智慧和自由意志，它们无法认识这个法则；然而，由于它们也具有自然赋予它们的感情，在某种程度上与我们的本性相同，因而它们也应该享有自然权利；人类从而也应该对动物承担一定的义务。事实上，如果我不想伤害我的同类，这似乎并不是因为他们具有理性，而是因为他们是有知觉的生命，这种品质在人与动物中都同样存在，至少应该给动物一种权利，使它们能够免受人类无故的虐待。

对原始人、原始人的真正需求以及职责的基础原理的研究是我们解决种种难题的唯一适合的途径，这种种难题存在于对精神上不平等的起源的研究上，存在于对政治组织的真实基础及其成员的相互权利关系的研究上，也存在于与之类似的重要却模糊不清的其他种种问题上。

如果我们以一种平静客观的眼光来看人类社会，似乎首先呈现在我们眼前的就是一幅弱肉强食的景象，我们的心灵必会为强者的残暴所震惊，同时也会为弱者的愚昧无知感到悲痛。在人类社会中，没有什么比强弱贫富这些外在的关系更不稳定的了，这些往往是由于机缘而非智慧确立的，因而，所有人类的制度，乍看起来，像是建立在沙滩上的城堡。然而，若要深入研究，在除去城堡周围的尘土和沙子之后，我们才能学会重视它坚实的根基。现在我们明白了，如果不对人类的天然能力和后天发展的能力做认真的研究，我们就无从发现这两者的区别，也无从区分在现实事物的构造中，哪一部分是造物主的作品，哪一部分是人类的艺术创作。由此看来，由这一重要问题所引起的对政治和道德的研究，无论从哪个方面来说，都是不无裨益的；并且，这种对各种政体历史的假设，也为人类自身提供了非常有益的借鉴。

设想如果任由我们自由发展，我们将会变成什么模样？想到这里，我们就应该对他(5)感恩，正是他伟大的双手不断修正我们的身体结构，并为之设立坚实的基础，他使我们免受身体结构可能带给我们的种种混乱，他赐给我们的幸福正来源于似乎使我们感到痛苦的那种生活之中。

(4) 这是自然法学派的看法，这个学派推翻了神权的说法，他们认为在文明社会建立以前，存在着一个自然状态，在这个状态中，自然赋予人类以基本的自由和平等的权利。卢梭在本文中论述的自然状态就是在这个意义上讲的。

(5) 他指的是造物主，卢梭有一种将自然和造物主混同起来的倾向。他否认神权，却承认自然是人类的造物主，并且赋予人类以自由平等的权利。后文还会看到，他提及的这个造物主，类似于神的地位，但不是神，他更多地是指自然。





本论


我将要论述的是人，并且，我要研究的这个问题提示我，必须向人们表明这样一种观点：害怕面对真理的人是不会提出这种问题的。现在，我将应约在智者面前班门弄斧，论述人性的起源，倘若能不辜负这个论题和各位评判员的话，我将感到无比荣幸。

我认为人类中间存在两种不平等，一种是我称之为自然上的或者生理上的不平等，因为这是由自然造成的，包括年龄、健康状况、体质强弱和智力或者心智上的各种差异；另一种，或许可称为精神上或政治上的不平等，它依靠一种特定的制度安排，并且至少经过人们的一致认同。后一种不平等赋予一部分人以特权，相反，其他处于劣势的人则没有，例如有一部分人比别人更富有，更尊贵，或更强大，甚至能让别人服从他们。

追问自然不平等的原因是毫无意义的，因为从它的简单定义中就能得到答案；追问这两种不平等之间有无本质的联系就更没有什么意义了，换句话说，这相当于在问，支配者是不是比被支配者更优越，一个人的体力、智力以及才能和品行是不是总能和他的权力和财富相匹配。这种问题让奴隶们在他们的主人面前讨论也许是有益的，而让一个理性的自由人在追求真理的时候提出这个问题，则是非常不合适的。

因此，这篇论文所要论述的正是这个主题：指出在事物发展的进程中，权利何时取代了暴力，自然在何时让位于法律，并且说明在经历了怎样的一系列奇迹之后，强者甘心为弱者服务，而人们甘心放弃已有的幸福去追求空想的安宁。

许多研究过社会基础的哲学家都感到有必要回归人类的自然状态，然而实际上没有一个人这样做。其中一些人不假思索地认为那时的人类已经有正义和非正义的观念，而丝毫不觉得他有必要去证明原始人为什么会有这些观念，或者这些观念对他们有什么用处。另一些人说每个人都生来拥有财产所有权，而没有解释何谓“所有”。还有一些人，一上来就赋予强者以统治弱者的权力，然后从中直接推导出政府的产生，而忽视了人类创造权威和政府的概念之前的漫长时期。简单地说，他们每一个人一直徘徊于需求、贪婪、压迫、欲望和骄奢这些在社会中产生的字眼上，并将它们直接移植到自然状态上，这样他们表面上是讲原始人，而实质上描述的是社会状态中的人。我们大多数的著述者从来没有怀疑过自然状态的存在，然而，《圣经》中却明确说第一个人已经立即从上帝那里获得了智慧和指示，他本身并不生活在自然状态中。如果我们像每一个信奉基督的哲学家那样，对摩西的著述(1)深信不疑，我们就发现即使在洪水来临之前，人类也不是生活在纯自然状态中的，除非他们遭遇某种神奇的际遇重新回到自然状态，那又另当别论。这种矛盾说法经不起推敲，也更不可能被证明。

让我们首先撇开那些事实，因为它们与我的问题无关。我在这个问题上所研究的内容不应该被视为历史的真相，而仅仅是在一定条件下进行的假设推理，与其说是为了确定事物的真实来源，不如说是为了解释事物的性质，就像我们的物理学家每天在研究宇宙的形成时所做的推理那样。宗教的训诫让我们相信，是上帝本人在创造人之后就让他们脱离自然状态，人生而不平等，仅仅是因为上帝的意志就是如此。但宗教并没有禁止我们根据人及其周围的事物的性质做出推断，如果任由人类自由发展，人类将会变成什么模样。这正是我要回答的问题，也是我在下文中将要讨论的主题。由于我的主题涉及人类的普遍情况，我将尽量使用一种适合各个民族的方式，或者说，抛开时间和地点，仅仅讨论人本身。我设想自己身处古代雅典的学园里，反复吟诵导师的教诲，柏拉图和色诺克拉底是评判员(2)，而听众就是整个人类。

纯粹的人啊！无论你身处何方，无论你有何种思想，请看你们的历史吧！我相信我曾读过它，不是在你爱说谎的同类写就的书中，而是在自然中，自然是永远不会说谎的。源于自然的一切都是真实的，如果偶有虚假，那一定是我不小心将自己的意见掺杂进去了。我将讨论的那个时代是多么古老，而你发生了多大的变化啊！可以说，我将要写下的就是你们这些纯粹的人的生活方式，你们原有的品性已经为教育和习惯所败坏，尽管没有完全败坏。我觉得有这样一个时代，人愿意永远驻足在那里；你也在寻找那个时代，并希望你们这些纯粹的人都生活在那里，永远不愿前进。由于对你们所处的时代感到不满，并预感到你们的子孙后代会因为相同的原因更加不满，你或许希望自己有权让社会倒退回去。这种想法势必使你们的祖先感到高兴，却会遭到你同时代人的批判，而且也会使不幸生在你以后的人震撼不已。

第一部分


为了正确判断人类的自然状态，就必须考察人类的起源，从人类形成的初期来研究人类的状态。尽管这样做很重要，但我仍不打算研究人类在连续不断的发展中逐渐形成的构造，也不打算停留在仅仅追问人类是怎样从最初的状态一步步转变成现在的模样的。我不打算去研究，是否真如亚里士多德所说，人的长指甲最初不过是弯曲的爪子；是否人像熊一样，全身长满毛发；或者，人在最初是否用四肢爬行，目光向下，局限在一小块范围中，不能看到广阔的大自然，因而限制了思想的发展。在这方面，我仅能提出模糊不清的几乎全凭想象的假设。比较解剖学至今没有什么进展，自然观察家们也不能为任何可靠的推断提供有力的证据。这样，在这个问题上，如果没有超自然的知识可以利用，也不能注意到那些人类将四肢应用于新用途和食用新食物而发生的身体内外构造的变化，我只能假设，那时的人类一直都和现在的人一样，用双腿行走，像我们一样使用双手，目光向前，能够看到广阔的大自然，也能看到广袤无垠的天空。

在这样一种生命构造中，如果剥离其中超自然的天赋以及在漫长的历史中获得的人为能力，即我们仅仅考虑人刚刚从自然中造出来的样子，我们就可以看到，人这种动物，既没有某些动物那么强壮，也没有某些动物那么敏捷，但总体来说，人体的构造是所有动物中最完善的。我看到，只要他能找得到橡果充饥，找到小溪解渴，还能在一棵橡树下睡上一觉，那么他的全部需要就都满足了。

如果大地还像以前那样肥沃，茂密的森林还能生长于斯，而树木也没有遭受刀斧砍伐，自然界仍然能够为所有的动物提供充足的食物和住所。而人类，生存在各种动物之间，凭借他们观察和学习的能力，获得了其他动物的生存本领，因而具有了任何其他动物不能比拟的优势：每种动物都只局限于一种本能，而人在最初也许没有任何一种本领，但是却学会了其他动物的生存本领。人能吃各种不同的食物，而其他动物只能吃其中的几种，因而人比其他动物更容易找到食物。

由于人类自幼年开始就长期生活在恶劣的气候条件中，不得不忍受疲劳，没有衣服御寒，没有武器防身，为了保护自己和食物，他们不得不和猛兽搏斗，并拼命奔跑以逃避野兽的追击。因而人获得了一种强壮的体质，并且几乎不会改变。人类的孩子，一出生就具有从父母那里遗传的优良体质，并在赋予他们这种体质的环境中不断磨炼，因此获得了人类特有的生存能力。自然对待他们就像斯巴达的公民对待自己的孩子一样(1)：他们只留下那些天生强壮的孩子，加以培养，使他们更加强壮有力，杀掉其余体质弱的孩子。这方面和现在的社会不同，在我们的国家里，父母视自己的孩子为累赘，在他们出生之前不论强壮与否一律杀掉。

原始人理解并能掌握的唯一工具就是他们的身体。他们的身体有各种不同的用途，而我们的身体则因缺乏锻炼什么能力都没有。现代技术使我们变得柔弱而笨拙，而原始人必须使自己强壮敏捷。如果他们有斧头，他们还有力气用手折断树枝吗？如果他们有投石器，他们还能将石块飞快地扔出去吗？如果他们有梯子，他们还能敏捷地爬上一棵树吗？如果他们有马，他们还能跑得这么快吗？假使文明人有足够的时间来使用机器，那么毫无疑问他们能打败原始人；但是，如果让他们赤身裸体站在一起，没有任何武器，你将会发现文明人和原始人之间的差距有多大。你将会看到一个随时全力以赴、随时准备应对一切变故、甚至始终具备一切力量和技巧的人占据多大的优势！

霍布斯(2)认为，人天生勇猛，争强好胜，喜欢打斗。而另一个杰出的哲学家则持相反的观点(3)，坝伯兰和普芬道夫(4)也认为，没有比原始人更温顺胆小的了，他们总是战战兢兢，即使是微弱的声音和细小的动作也能吓到他们，让他们落荒而逃。在他们遇到不认识的事物时，这种情况可能会发生，我也毫不怀疑，他们会被任何一种新奇的事物吓到，因为他们不能判断出眼前的事物对他们有利还是有害，他们也不能将可能遇到的危险与自己的能力做出正确的对比。然而这种情况在自然状态中不常出现，那时，所有的事物都以单纯的方式前进，大地上也不会发生突然的或者持续不断的动荡，这种动荡往往是由生活在一起的人的欲望碰撞和胡作非为引起的。对于原始人来说，他们散居于各种动物之间，不断地和野兽争斗，因而他们能迅速将野兽和自己的能力做出对比。当他们发现自己在智巧方面胜过野兽的程度远远超过野兽在力量上胜过他的程度时，他们就明白再也不用害怕它们了。当一只熊或者一只狼和一个强壮、敏捷而勇敢的（所有原始人都是如此）并且拿着石块或者棍子的原始人搏斗的时候，你会看出至少双方都会有危险。这样，经过一番试探之后，这些原本就不喜欢相互攻击的野兽也不会攻击人了，因为它们知道这些原始人和它们一样凶猛。而有些野兽在力量上胜过人的程度远远超过了人在智巧方面胜过它们的程度，这样，原始人就和其他弱小动物处于相同的境地。不过即使这样，他们也能生存下去。况且，原始人还有一个优势：他们和其他动物跑得一样快，而且能在任何一棵树上找到安全的避难所，面对野兽的时候，他们可以自由选择进行搏斗或者逃跑。另外，并不是所有动物都会天然地攻击人，除非是出于自卫或者迫于饥饿。动物也不会对人产生天然的反感，这种反感好像表明一种动物注定要成为另一种动物的食物。

这无疑就是黑人和原始人不怕在树林里遇到野兽的原因了。其中委内瑞拉的加勒比人在这方面可以说是绝对安全，而且没有任何不方便之处。弗朗索瓦·柯勒阿(5)告诉我们，他们仅仅带着弓和箭就可以自由行走于树林中，从来都没有听说过他们当中有人被野兽吃掉。

然而，人类有更可怕的敌人，而且没有任何防御的办法，这就是年幼、衰老和各种疾病带来的天然虚弱。这些都是人类弱点的不幸证据，其中前两者是每种动物都会遇到的，而最后一种主要存在于社会状态中的人那里。讲到年幼，可以观察到，人类的母亲可以随身带着自己的孩子，比起那些劳碌不堪往来于觅食和喂养孩子之间的动物母亲来说，人类的母亲更容易养育自己的孩子。当然，如果母亲不幸死亡，孩子随之而去的可能性很大；但是所有动物都有这种危险，在能养活自己之前，幼崽总得有一段时间要依赖母亲。人类的幼年时期比动物更长，寿命也相应更长，因此所有的动物在这方面都是大致同等的。虽然在幼年生活时期和幼崽数目上还有其他的规律，然而这与我讨论的问题并不相干。在老年时，人类活动减少，分泌物也减少，对食物的需求也随着觅食能力变弱而减少。虽然原始人不会得风湿和痛风这一类疾病，但是衰老却是人最没有能力缓解的一种痛苦。然后他们会悄然死去，没有人会注意到，甚至连他自己也不会意识到。

关于疾病，我不想重复大多数健康人所说的反对医学的肤浅谬论。然而我要问问，有无确凿证据能够证明在医学最不发达的地方人们的寿命要比医学最发达的地方的人更短？如果我们自身带来的疾病比医学能够治疗的疾病更多的话，又能说明什么呢？人们的生活方式极度不平衡，一些人过于安逸，另一些人过度劳累。一方面，纵情的欢娱损害了我们的感觉，过于精致的食物给我们过多的热量，使我们消化不良；另一方面，穷人吃的食物有损于健康，并且往往不足以果腹，这使他们一旦有机会就暴饮暴食，从而伤害脾胃。所有这些，加上熬夜、不节制、各种情欲的放纵、身体疲劳、精神衰竭，和各种生活条件下数不清的痛苦和焦虑掺杂在一起，使人们难享片刻安宁(6)。这种种事实表明，大多数疾病是由我们自己造成的，而我们想要摆脱这些疾病，只能转而坚持那种自然赋予我们的简朴、单纯和清静的生活。如果自然注定使人健康，那么我敢断言，思考就是一种违反自然的状态，而一个思考着的人必定是一种痛苦的动物。当我们想到原始人的优良体质——至少那些还没有被我们的烈酒毁坏的身体，当我们想到他们除了受伤和衰老以外没有任何不适的时候，我们就不得不相信，人类文明发展的历史，就是一段疾病增多的历史。至少柏拉图这样认为。他曾经根据波达利尔和马卡翁在特洛伊城被围的时候使用过和推荐过的药方推断(7)，那时的人们并没有意识到这些药物会引起一些疾病。塞尔苏斯也说过，希波克拉底发明的节食疗法对现在的人们非常有用(8)。

原始人很少得病，因而不需要医疗，更不需要医生，他们在这方面与动物差不多。这一点从猎人那里就能知道，他们打猎的时候，是否见过受伤的动物。他们一定经常看到受过重伤的动物伤口已经结疤，或者折断骨头和四肢的，它们无须任何外科手术，时间自会治愈伤口，它们只需过正常的生活，不需要任何护理疗养。它们不用忍受手术的痛苦，没有药物的毒害，也不受禁食折磨，它们的伤口照样愈合得很好。总之，不管医学对人来说多么有用，原始人在生病的时候只依靠自然，除了疾病之外他们没有什么可担心的，他们的生存状态令人向往。

因此，不能把原始人和我们经常见到的人混为一谈。自然带着一种偏爱之心照管所有动物，并且似乎她非常珍视这种权利。无论是马、猫、牛还是驴，在野外生存的普遍都比圈养的更高大，也更有活力，更有朝气，更强壮，更勇敢。一旦被人驯养，它们便丧失了大半优点，好像我们所有对它们的关怀和养育都只是对它们的损害。人类也是如此，当他们具有了社会性，成为一个奴隶，他们就变得虚弱胆小，奴性十足。他们萎靡安逸的生活方式完全消磨了他们的力量和勇气。原始人和文明人之间的差别，比野生动物和驯养动物之间的差别还要大。因为，虽然自然对人与动物并未区别对待，然而，人却通过使自己沉溺于比他们驯养的动物更安逸的生活而堕落得更深。

所以，原始人赤身裸体，没有住所，没有我们认为必需的一切奢侈品，但并不因此就有什么不幸，这些也不会对他们的生存造成威胁。如果他们身上没有毛发覆盖，那是因为他们生活在温暖的气候中，不需要这种保护；而如果他们生活在寒冷的国度，他们很快就会学会把他们捕获的动物的皮毛披在自己身上；如果他们只用两条腿走路，那么他们就用双手保护自己，获取食物。尽管他们的孩子走得慢，并且难以学会走路，但是他们的母亲能够轻易携带他们。这是其他动物所没有的优势，在遭受追击的时候，动物母亲不得不抛弃幼崽或者放慢脚步和它们一起跑。总之，除非我们设想遇到一种偶然的巧合（我将在后文提及(9)）——这种情况几乎不可能发生——无论如何我们都很容易明白，第一个给自己做衣服、建造住所的人是给自己制造了一些根本不需要的累赘。因为没有这些东西，他一样能够生活，他没有理由在成年之后反而不能忍受自小就一直过的那种生活。

孤独、闲散并且时刻伴随着危险的原始人不能不喜欢睡觉——就像其他不大思考的动物一样——只要不思考，他们就一直睡着。他们必须睡得警醒，因为保护自己是他们主要甚至是唯一需要考虑的事，他们必须经常锻炼攻击和防卫的能力，要么用于捕获猎物，要么防止自己成为其他动物的猎物。相反，原始人那些享受安逸和情欲的器官必定极度不发达，与任何精致的东西都不能相容，而视觉、听觉和嗅觉则发展得灵敏细致。总体而言，这是一种动物的状态，而根据旅行家的叙述(10)，也是大部分原始人的状态。毫不奇怪，好望角的霍屯督人用肉眼就能看到远处海上的船，而荷兰人需要借助望远镜才能看到；美洲的原始人能像最优秀的猎狗一样用嗅觉追踪西班牙人；或者，原始人不穿衣服也不觉得难受，他们能吃下大量的辣椒，能像喝水一样喝下最烈的欧洲白酒。

到此为止，我仅仅谈到原始人的生理方面，下面我将谈谈原始人的精神和智力方面。

我认为任何动物都是一部精密的机器，自然给它装上感觉，使它活动起来，保护自己，并在某种程度上防止自己受到干扰或者破坏。我觉得人也是这样的机器，不同的是，在运作动物这台机器时，自然是唯一的操作者，而人作为一个自由的操作者，在运作机器和形成性格上享有一部分权利。动物由本能来决定取舍，而人则依靠自由意志。因此，动物无法偏离自然给它设定的轨道，即使那样做对它有利；相反，人经常偏离这种轨道，即使那样做对他有害。由此而知，鸽子会饿死在一盘美味的肉旁边，而猫也会饿死在一堆水果谷物面前，尽管只要它们想到要尝试一下，也许就会在这些它们不屑一顾的食物中获得营养。正因如此，挥霍无度的人才会恣意放纵，招致疾病和死亡，因为精神能够损害感官。自然需求已经满足的时候，意识还没完没了地提出要求。

动物也有观念，因为它们都有感觉，在某种程度上，这种观念甚至能联结在一起，正是在观念联结的程度上，人区别于动物。一些哲学家甚至声称人与人之间的差别比人与动物之间的差别还要大。因此，造成人与动物之间差别的不是理解能力而是人的自由意志。自然为人和动物制定了法则，动物乖乖顺从，人虽然也受这种力量的束缚，但他们知道自己能够自主决定是遵守还是违抗。正是他们对自由意志的意识使他们的心智得以发展。物理学也许能在某种程度上解释感觉的机制和观念的形成，然而在这种意志能力或者说选择能力，以及对这种能力的认识方面，我们只能发现纯精神的活动，这是力学规律(11)完全无法解释的。

然而即使所有问题都困难重重，我们也还应该考虑人与动物之间的另一种差别，并且在这一点上没有任何争议，这就是自我发展的能力，这种能力是人类中每一个体与生俱来的，也是整个人类都具有的。在环境的协助下，人类通过这种能力逐渐发展出其他能力。然而，动物则不是，它们的能力在最初的几个月里形成，就会持续一生，并且在几千年后，它们的能力仍和几千年前一样，没有任何改变。为什么只有人能够变得老弱糊涂？难道不是因为他又回到了原初状态？对于动物来说，它们没有得到，因而也无从失去，它们只受本能的支配，而人一旦年老或者发生事故就会失去那些曾使他们成长的优良品质，以致沦落到比动物还不如的境地。不幸的是，我们不得不承认这种天生的无限发展的能力正是我们不幸的根源；正是这种能力，借助于时间的发展，将人类从安宁无知的原始状态中驱逐出来；正是这种能力，赋予人类在各个时代所具有的智慧和错误、缺点和美德，并使人最终成为自然和他们自己的暴君(12)。我们不得不把教会奥里诺科的印第安人用木片贴在儿童的头上以期保留他们一部分无知和原始幸福的做法的人称为慈善家，这是很有启发性的一件事。

原始人仅具有自然赋予的原始能力，或者说是自然为了补偿最初他们可能缺少的能力而赋予他们的，后来却使他们超越这些纯动物性的能力。因此，视觉和感觉必定是他们最基本的能力，这与其他动物一样。直到新环境激发他们的能力发展之前，愿意或不愿意、喜欢还是害怕都是他们最初的和几乎全部的精神活动。

无论伦理家们怎样认为，人类智力的发展都应该主要归功于欲望，而欲望能否被普遍满足要依靠智力的发展。正是由于欲望的推动，智力才能得以发展，我们之所以渴望知识是因为我们希望享受，我们不可能设想一个既没有任何恐惧也没有任何喜好的人会去费力地思考。同时，欲望源于我们的需求，而欲望的发展也依赖于我们知识的积累，因为除非我们知道这些概念，或者源于自然的简单冲动，否则我们并不会喜欢或者害怕任何事物。对于原始人，他们没有任何一种知识，只有自然冲动的欲望，他们所追求的永远不会超过他们的生理需要。在这个世界上，他只知道食物、女人和睡觉是好的，唯一害怕的也只有伤痛和饥饿。我所说的伤痛并不包括死亡，因为没有动物知道什么是死亡，死亡以及对死亡的恐惧的知识是人在脱离动物状态之后获得的最初的知识之一。

如有必要，我不难举出事实来证明这个观点。在世界上所有的民族中，智力的发展总是精确地与人们的自然需求成正比，或者说是与人们因环境的压力而产生的需要成正比，因此，也与促使人们去满足的种种欲望成正比。我可以说明，埃及的艺术是随着尼罗河的泛滥发展起来的。我也可以追寻希腊艺术的踪迹，它在阿提卡的岩石和沙砾中生根、发芽并成长为参天大树，却无法生长在欧罗塔斯河肥沃的岸边。我观察到北方人比南方人更勤劳，因为如果不这样他们就无法生存。好像自然要使事物趋于平等，在她不愿使土地肥沃的地方便赐给那里的人们以高明的智慧。

然而，即使没有历史上那些不确定的证据，谁都能够看得出来，一切都似乎在剥夺原始人改变自身境遇的欲望和手段。原始人的想象力描绘不出任何图景，他们的内心没有任何要求。他们仅有的需求轻易就能被满足，他们没有必需的知识使他们产生更多的需求，他们不能预见任何事情，也没有任何好奇心。他们越熟悉自然，就越对自然不感兴趣，他们看到自然总是周而复始，一切都正常进行，他们没有足够的能力去欣赏伟大的奇观；即使他们曾知道观察他们的日常生活，我们也不能期望从他们内心发现哲人的爱好。由于没有任何搅扰，他们心里完全只考虑现在的感受，丝毫不为将来做打算，即使是不远的将来。他们所考虑的事情，同他们的心智一样有限，甚至几乎不能计划天黑之前的事情。即使现在，加勒比的土著人的见识范围也仅限于此，他们早上轻率地卖掉棉被，晚上又为重新买回棉被而伤心，他们连晚上还需要棉被也想不到。

我们越思考这个问题，纯粹感觉和最简单的知识之间的差距就显得越远。事实上，简直无法设想，一个人仅靠自己的力量而不借助于交流或者需求的刺激就能够填补这个鸿沟。多少世纪以后，人们才能认识天火以外的火！在多少偶然的机会发生之后人们才能学会火的基本用法！在多少次熄灭之后，人们才能学会生火的技术！又有多少次这种技术随着发明生火的人的死亡而失传！我们应该怎样看待农业呢？它需要投入如此多的劳动和预见，还需要依赖于其他很多技术。显而易见，农业只能在社会中才能产生，或者最早在社会建立之初产生。我们并不是希望从农业耕作中获得那些能自行生长的食物，而是要在土地上生产最适合我们口味的食物。让我们做个猜想。假如人口过度繁衍，土地上产出的粮食自然不能养活他们——顺便提一下，这种假设已经能够证明这种生活非常适合人类——假如没有炼铁厂，也没有制造厂，劳动工具已经从天上掉下来落在原始人手中；假如他们也已经克服了对持续不断的劳动的天然厌恶；假如他们已经学会了对自身需求有足够的预见；假如他们已经猜到了怎样耕耘土地、播种植树；假如他们已经发现了碾谷和酿酒的技术——假如上帝已经把所有事情教给他们，因为他们自己是不可能发明这些技术的，即使这一切都发生了，如果他们在辛苦耕耘之后，他们的粮食却可能被第一个来到并且看上这些粮食的人或者动物抢走，那么他们谁还会愚蠢到自寻烦恼去耕种土地呢？尤其当他们越是需要得到劳动的报酬、越是确定不能得到的时候，哪个人还愿意终生从事繁重的劳动呢？总之，在他们还没分配土地之前，也就是说，他们还没有消灭自然状态的时候，人们怎么会愿意耕种土地呢？

如果我们假设原始人已经训练成哲学家那样的思维方式，假如我们也像哲学家那样，把原始人想象成一个哲学家，他们能够研究崇高的真理，能够通过高度抽象的逻辑推理，从对普遍秩序的热爱中，从对创世者意志的认识中，创造出智慧和正义的箴言，简言之，我们假设原始人原本就聪颖明智，然而实际上他们蠢笨无知，那么，人类能从这种不能彼此交流却会随着创造者的死亡而消失的智慧中得到什么好处呢？在树林中与动物混杂在一起的人类能有什么进步呢？没有固定住所，不需要彼此协助，两个人一生中也难得见两次面，或许他们彼此之间根本不认识，也不曾在一起交谈，这样的原始人能有什么改善，彼此之间又能有什么启示呢？

设想一下，有多少观念的产生要归功于语言的使用，语法对锻炼人的思维活动又起了多大作用！让我们想象一下，最初语言的发明花费了难以想象的大量时间，经历了多少难以想象的艰辛苦痛！根据这些假设和前述的种种假设，我们可以做出判断，要经历多少个千年的漫长岁月，人类才能逐渐发展出他所能进行的这些思维活动呢？

在这里，我想用少许时间思考一下语言产生的种种困难，对于这个问题，我只需简单引用孔狄亚克神父(13)的研究就够了，因为这些完全证实了我的观点，并且或许在最初还启发了我。但是从这位哲学家解决抽象符号的起源的方式来看，显然他将我质疑的问题当作了他假设的前提，即：在最早创造语言的那群人中，一定已经有某种社会联系了。因此，在引用他的研究时，我认为应该加上我的观点，以便适合从我的角度来解释同样的难题。首先呈现的难题是考虑语言是如何成为必要的，因为原始人之间既没有任何交流，也没有任何交流的必要，若非有任何程度的必要，我们无法想象发明语言的必要性，甚至连这种可能性都没有。我同意有些人认为语言起源于父母子女之间的家庭内部交流的观点，但是这种权宜之计并不能解决问题，还可能招致那些将社会状态中的观念硬搬到自然状态中的人犯的错误。他们一直认为那时的家庭和现在的家庭一样，一家人同住在一个屋檐下，全家人亲密而长久地联为一体，许多共同利益将他们结合在一起。然而，事实上，在原始状态中，人们根本没有房屋，甚至没有茅屋，也没有任何财产。每个人都是随便找一个地方休息，几乎不会在一个地方重复住两夜。男女之间的结合也没有任何计划，他们偶然碰到，或者机缘巧合，或者彼此愿意就结合在一起，他们并不怎么需要语言来交流彼此的想法，他们分开的时候和之前一样陌生。母亲喂养孩子，最初也只是因为那样对她有利，后来，在她习惯之后，就喜欢上孩子，才会因为爱孩子而喂养他。一旦孩子长大能够独立谋生，他就会自动离开母亲。除非这些原始人经常见面，才不会忘记彼此，否则，他们再见面的时候也不会认识对方。进一步思考就会发现，孩子有许多需求需要说明，他必然比母亲有更多的话要说，因此孩子必然担当了发明语言的重任(14)。每个孩子都有自己的一套语言，因此语言的数量必然和使用语言的人数相等。语言的种类也会随着他们漂泊不定的生活而增多，却没有足够的时间能让语言固定下来。那种认为母亲教会孩子用语言来说明他想要的东西的说法，仅仅解释了人们怎样来传授那些已经产生的语言，而丝毫没有解释语言是怎样产生的。

然而无论如何，让我们假设第一个难题已经解决，我们暂且不理会在自然状态和语言成为必需之间的那个漫长的时期，暂且承认语言产生的必要性，来探寻语言最初是如何产生的。这样我们就有一个新的却更难解答的难题，因为如果人们需要语言来学习思考，那么为了发明语言，他们必然更需要学会如何思考。即使我们能够想到发音语言是如何成为解释我们思想的约定工具的，我们仍然需要知道，对于那些不能感知的抽象物、不能用手势和声音表达的思想该使用什么样的约定工具呢？因此关于这种交流思想和建立精神联系的艺术的起源，我们还难以做出任何合理的猜测。这一艺术如此精深，并早已远离它的源头，哲学家们还在离这种艺术的完善状态遥不可测的距离研究它，就算是任何一个大胆的人也不能断言它是如何一步步臻于完善的。即使伴随时光流逝而发生的变化对它完全不产生影响，即使我们的学者能够摒弃所有偏见，甚或做到客观公正，所有的学术团体都毫不间断地连续几个世纪研究这个问题，恐怕也没有谁能做出这种断言。

在人们还没有必要使用语言来劝服大众的时候，人类使用的最初的语言，同时也是最普遍、最生动和唯一的语言，就是自然的简单呼叫(15)。这是在紧急情况下由本能所激发的声音，用于在遇到危险的时候求救或者希望减轻疼痛，这种语言在日常生活中并不经常使用，因为人们平时的感情比较节制。当人们的观念开始发展并逐渐增多时，人们的交往也更密切，人们就致力于创造更多符号和更加丰富的语言，他们增加声音的抑扬变化，并辅以手势的运用。手势就其本身而言，有更强的表现力，也更少依赖于预先规定的含义。于是人们用手势表达那些看得见和移动的事物，而用声音来模仿听得见的事物。然而，除了实际存在的或者便于描述的事物以及能看得到的行为能用手势来表达之外，别的事物就难以用手势来表达。手势也并不是在任何时候都有用，黑暗和物体的遮挡就会使手势失去作用。除此之外，手势只是有引起别人注意的要求，而不能确保别人一定能注意到。因而人们最终决定使用发音语言来代替手势，声音虽然不能与特定的概念产生相同的联系，但却能作为约定符号更好地表达它们。不过，这种约定完全通过人们的共识得以实现，而对于那些原始人来说，他们粗糙的器官还不能适应任何这种情况，他们必然经历了艰难困苦才接受这种方式。这种约定本身就难以理解，因为要获得人们的共识就必须有可行的理由，而且，要使用语言，就必须得先有语言。

我们可以合理地设想，人们最初使用的词语比语言形成以后的词语的含义要广泛得多。最初，人们并不知道要将句子分成结构不同的几部分，因此他们把一整句话的含义都放在一个词语中。当他们开始区分中心词和定语、名词和动词的时候，那本身就已经显示出非凡的天才了。名词最初不过是许多专有名词，动词只有现在时态，而形容词概念的发展一定经历了艰苦的努力，因为每个形容词都是一个抽象的概念，而对事物进行抽象是一个既费力又不自然的过程。

最初，每个事物都有一个特定的名称，不管它们的种属差别，因为最早创造语言的人并不能区分种属，每个事物都照它自然的样子单独反映在他们的头脑中。如果这棵橡树叫作A，那么另一棵橡树就叫作B，因为最初人们认为这两个事物是不一样的。人们通常需要很长时间才能发现这两者的共同点。因此人们对事物的认识越浅薄，他们所创造的词语就越庞杂，然而使用这些词汇所造成的困难不会轻易消除。因为要给事物分类命名必须认识各种事物特有的属性，这就需要判断和定义，也就是说，需要远比那时的人类所能拥有的更深厚的自然知识和抽象概括能力。

另外，不借助词语，人们内心就不能形成概念，并且除非借助词句，人们才能理解这些概念，这也是动物之所以不能形成这种观念并因此获得自我完善的能力的原因之一，而自我完善能力依赖于这些观念的形成。当一只猴子吃掉一个坚果去摘另一个坚果的时候，我们能认为它明白坚果的一般含义并用这个一般含义和那两个具体的坚果作比较吗？当然不能。不过当它看到一个坚果的时候，就会想起以前接触过的另一个坚果的那种感觉，它的眼睛受到这种特定接触的影响，从而能够预知它吃到这个坚果时的味道。每个概念都是纯抽象的，只要想象稍一参与，概念立刻变成具体的了。如果你想在脑海中勾勒出一棵树的一般形象，你无论如何也描绘不成功。不管你怎样做，你只能想到一棵具体的树，大树或者小树，光秃的或者长满叶子的，浅色的或者深色的。如果你想看到一切树的共同点，那你看到的反而不像是一棵树了。要认识纯抽象的事物只能通过这种方式，换言之，只能借助于语言。一个三角形的定义本身就能给你一个关于三角形的真实观念；但是当你想象一个三角形时，你想出的一定是一个具体的三角形，而非其他，你会不由自主地想象出具体的线条和有特定颜色的区域。因此我们必须使用词句和语言来形成概念，因为想象一旦停止，我们只能借助于语言来思考。如果语言的最初发明者只能给他们已经认识的事物以名称的话，那么最初的名词也只能是专有名词了(16)。

然而，当最早的文法学家以一种我无法理解的方法开始扩展观念和概化词语的时候，发明者的无知必然会将这种方法限制在极窄的范围内。如果当初由于不知道种属而制造出太多的个别名词的话，在后来又由于不能认识所有事物之间的差别，他们只能做简单的分类。要把事物之间的区别恰当地归类，确实需要更多的知识和经验，也需要付出更多的艰苦努力和探索。如果说直到今天，人们还不断发现那些一直未曾发现的新种类，那么可以设想有多少种类被那些仅靠表面就定类的人们忽视了！更不用说有多少原始类别和最普遍的概念同样被忽视了。比如，他们如何能理解甚或想到诸如物质、精神、实体、风格、形象和动作这些词语呢？即使现在那些经常使用这些词语的哲学家们，也很难理解它们的含义，况且这些概念本身的含义就是高度抽象的，在现实中找不到任何原型。

讲到这一点，我暂且请评判员们停止阅读，来考虑一下，在创造了物质名词这一语言最简单的部分之后，要使用精确的语言和固定的形式来表达想法，要使语言满足公众的需要并且对社会产生影响，人类还有多少路要走？请你们想象一下，要花费多少时间运用多少知识才能发明数字、抽象名词、不定过去式和所有动词的时态、冠词、句法、词句的连接方式、推理形式以及所有的语言逻辑。至于我自己已经被越来越多的困难所震撼，我深信，单凭人类的智慧就能建立起语言体系已经几乎被证明是不可能的了。我将把这个问题留给任何一个有志于此的人去研究：社会的存在对于语言的产生和语言的产生对于社会的建立，哪一个更为必要呢？

无论语言和社会是怎样产生的，但至少可以推断，在以相互需要来联结人们并使他们易于使用语言这方面来说，自然几乎没有为人们提供多少社会性，并且也几乎没有为创造这些联系而做任何努力。事实上，我们很难想象在自然状态中一个人需要另一个人的帮助会比一只猴子或者一只狼需要它们的同伴的帮助更迫切；即使他真的需要，别人为什么要来帮助他，又或者，即使别人愿意帮助他，他们又如何能达成一致呢？我常常听人讲起，没有比自然状态中的人更悲惨的了；事实上如果确实像我认为已经证明的那样，人类在经历了漫长的时期之后才能有脱离自然状态的愿望和机会，那么我们控诉的对象也只能是自然，而不是自然不幸创造出的人类。然而，我所理解的悲惨这个词没有任何意义，它或者仅仅指艰苦的贫困生活或者指身体或心灵的痛苦。那么我倒乐意有人能解释一下，一个行动自由、内心平静、身体健康的人能遭受什么样的悲惨状况呢？我还想追问，到底是社会生活还是自然生活能使一个身处这种生活之中的人感到难受呢？看看我们的文明社会，很少有人不抱怨自己的人生，我们甚至能看到许多人甘愿抛弃自己的生命，即使所有神的法律和人的法律都结合在一起也不能制止这种混乱。我还想继续追问，有谁听说过原始人有过这些想法？有谁听说过原始人有空就会抱怨人生或者自杀？所以，稍稍放下我们的虚荣心，就能判断出来到底哪种状态才是真正的悲惨。但从另一个角度来看，如果原始人困惑于科学研究，被欲望折磨，总是纠缠于探索一种异己的状态，那才真正是再悲惨不过了。似乎天意如此深谋远虑，使人类所拥有的潜能只在合适的时机才得以发展，不至于发展太早而陷入无穷无尽的困惑之中，也不至于发展太晚以至于不能满足后来产生的需要。仅就人所拥有的本能而言，就足以应付自然状态的生活了，而要在社会中生活，就需要发展智慧了。

初看上去，好像原始状态的人之间没有任何道德联系，彼此之间也没有规定的义务，既没有好坏之分，也没有善恶之别，除非从生理意义上理解这些词，将那些对人的生存有利的叫作善，对人的生存有害的叫作恶。这样，那些对自然的原始冲动最不加以抵抗的就是最有道德的人。如果只从常规意义上来理解这些词，我们就不会急于对这个问题下判断，为了防止偏见的可能影响，我们应该不偏不倚地衡量一下在文明人当中美德和邪恶哪一个更多。是否美德给他们带来的益处超过了邪恶给他们带来的害处？当人们学会彼此爱护的时候，我们能否看到科学的进步足以弥补人们彼此之间的伤害？或者总体来讲，是人们既不互相惧怕又对彼此无所要求的时候感觉更幸福，还是人们普遍依附于别人、为别人尽所有义务而别人可以对他没有任何回报的时候感觉更幸福？

总之，我们不能像霍布斯那样断言，因为人不知道善，所以人必定是天生邪恶的，人之所以邪恶，是因为他们不知道善为何物；他们不会给同伴任何帮助，因为他们认为同伴没有权利要求他们帮忙，或者他们认为他们有权得到任何想要的东西，甚至愚蠢到认为他们是全世界的主人。尽管霍布斯清楚地看到了自然法则的现代定义的全部缺陷，但是从他得出的结论就可以看出他的理解是完全错误的(17)。按照他的方式来推论，原本应该得出这样的结论：原始状态的每个人都只关心自己的生存，这是对他人最无害的一种活动，也是最有利于促进人类和平相处的一种方式，因而也是最适合人类生存的一种方式。然而他得出的结论恰恰相反，他将社会中出现的需要法律加以限制的对无数欲望的满足错误地加在原始人对自身生存的关注上。霍布斯认为，一个恶人就是一个强壮的婴儿，让人难以理解的是为什么原始人就是一个强壮的婴儿呢？即使我们承认这一点，那又能得出什么结论呢？如果原始人果真是既强壮又像婴儿一样依靠他人生活，那么他就可以肆无忌惮任意妄为了。如果他的母亲没能及时喂他，他就可以打她；如果他弟弟惹恼了他，他就可以虐待他；如果别人稍稍触犯他，他就可以咬别人的胳膊。然而，一个原始人既强壮又需要依靠别人这本身就是非常荒谬的说法，一个人如果需要依赖别人，那他一定很虚弱，而他一旦强壮起来，他就能自力更生。(18)霍布斯没有意识到，他据以阻止原始人使用智力的理由，正是法学家们据以阻止原始人使用暴力的同一个理由。按照霍布斯的说法，也可以这样论述：原始人并非恶人，仅仅因为他们并不知道什么是善，他们不去为非作歹，并非因为智力发展，也非法律限制的结果，而仅仅是因为他们内心平静，对邪恶一无所知：“一个人从对邪恶的无知中获得的益处，要远远多于他从对美德的认识中获得的益处。”(19)

霍布斯还忽视了另一个重要的原则，当人类看到同类受难时，他们内心会产生天然的反感，这种人类天生具有的同情心，在某种程度上缓和了人们强烈的自我中心主义，或者说在自我主义产生以前，缓解了人们对自我生存的强烈关注以及对追逐自身利益的巨大热情(20)。这就是人类拥有的唯一的自然美德，即使是对人类品性最激烈的诋毁者也不能否认，因此，我并不担心任何非难之词。我所说的同情心对于我们人类这样脆弱又多灾多难的生物来说是一种非常适宜的品质。早在人类开始思考之前人们就已经有同情心了，这是人类所有品性中最普遍最有用的一种品性。同时，由于同情心是最自然的品性，某些动物身上有时也表现出它的某些迹象。且不说母亲对孩子有慈爱之情，在遇到危险的时候她会奋不顾身地保护自己的孩子，就是一匹马也不忍心践踏一个活物；动物都不忍心从它同类的尸体旁边走过，有些动物甚至会给它死去的同类做某种形式的埋葬；当牲畜走进屠宰场的时候，它们会发出凄惨的哀鸣，那正表明它们看到的可怕的情景给它们留下了挥之不去的阴影。我们愉快地发现，即使是《蜜蜂的寓言》(21)的作者也不得不承认，人是一种有同情心的敏感的动物。在他举出的事例中，他一改往日冷隽敏锐的文风，描绘了一个慈悲的动人场景：一个人在他的囚室里看到一只野兽从母亲的怀里抢走婴儿，凶残地撕碎孩子的肢体，抓破了那颗正在跳动的心脏。虽然这件事与他毫不相关，但是他仍觉得心惊肉跳，他眼睁睁地看着这可怕的一切，却不能给那个昏死的母亲和她垂死的孩子任何帮助，他该是怎样地焦急不安啊！

这就是人类纯真的自然感情，它先于任何种类的思考而存在。这就是同情心的力量，即使是最败坏的风气也不能摧毁它。我们经常看见剧院里的人为剧中遭受不幸的人伤心落泪，然而如果他们成为暴君，只会更加残暴地对待这些人。即使嗜杀如苏拉(22)，也为他人的痛苦而伤感，只要那不是由他造成的；菲尔王亚历山大(23)也是如此，他可以每天无动于衷地听那些他下令绞死的人临终的哀号，却不敢去看任何一场悲剧，他害怕自己会和安德罗马克和普利阿莫一样哭泣。

“自然赋予人类以眼泪，那是因为她赐给人类以最慈悲的心。”(24)

曼德维尔清楚地知道，尽管人类具有一切道德，如果自然不给我们的理智加上同情心，那么人类也只不过是一群怪物。但是他所不知道的是，他所否认的那些美德正是从同情心这种感情里发展出来的。如果没有对弱者、罪人和人类的普遍的同情，怎么会有慷慨、仁慈和人性这些美德呢？如果我们能正确理解，即使是善良和友谊也不过是对某个特定对象的持久的同情，因为不希望一个人痛苦，和希望一个人幸福有什么区别呢？所谓同情只是设想我们和受难者一起遭受痛苦而产生的一种感情。这种感情在原始人身上可能是模糊不清的，但却十分强烈，在文明人身上虽然有所发展，却是微弱的。这个事实充分证实了我的观点。

动物对它同类遭受的苦难感受越深，它感受到的同情就越强烈，那么很明显，这种同情在自然状态下远远比在理性状态中更为深切。自尊来自理性并经由思考而加强，理性使人关注自我，远离那些让他痛苦或难受的一切事物。正是哲学使人孤立自己，正是哲学使一个人在看到别人的不幸的时候暗中说：“你难受是你的事，反正我很安全。”只有普遍的邪恶对整个社会的威胁才能搅扰哲学家的清梦，使他从自己的美梦中惊醒。杀人者在他窗外肆无忌惮地杀人的时候，他所做的也只是捂着自己的耳朵，为自己辩护，以阻止那种天然的对被害者的同情的滋生(25)，虽然他的本性并不能完全做到这一点。未开化的原始人就没有这种高明的才能，由于缺乏理性和智慧，他们总是无知地服从人性的原始召唤。当街头发生大规模暴乱的时候，民众吵闹不休，聪明的人谨慎逃开，而制止混乱、疏散人群的却是那些所谓的暴民和市井妇女。

因此可以断定，同情心这种自然的感情，能够缓和个人强烈的私心，因而对全人类的生存做出巨大贡献。正是这种同情心使我们不假思索地帮助苦难的人；正是同情心在自然状态中起到法律、道德和风俗的作用，并且比这更有用，因为没有人想抗拒它温柔的召唤；正是同情心，使一个强壮的原始人在有其他办法找到食物的时候，就不会去抢虚弱的老人和孩子得之不易的食物；正是同情心以“做对自己有利的事，尽量不要伤害别人”这句自然的至善之言引导人们，而不是用另一句更崇高的理性正义的箴言来教导人们“你希望别人怎样对你，你就怎样对别人”，尽管前一句不够完美，但它却更有用。总之，与其在高深的辩论中，不如在自然的感情中，寻找一个人在他作恶之后会感到内疚的原因，尽管他可能完全没有受过任何教育箴言的启示。尽管苏格拉底和与他类似的人能够通过推理来获得美德，但如果整个人类只以人们的理性为生存之本的话，那人类也许早已不复存在了。

原始人没有强烈的欲望，又受到同情心的良好约束，因此，与其说他们邪恶，不如说他们仅仅是粗野而已。他们更关注在危险可能降临的时候保护自己，而丝毫不想伤害他人，他们之间也因此不会发生激烈的冲突。他们彼此之间没有任何交往，因而不知道什么是虚荣、尊敬、重视和轻视，他们不知道什么是“你的”(26)，什么是“我的”(27)，也不知道正义为何物，他们认为暴力只不过造成了一些容易复原的伤害，而不把它当作一种应该受到惩罚的罪行。他们从来都没有报复的念头，除非当场机械地反抗，就像一只狗有时会撕咬投向它的石头一样。因为争斗也只是为了生存，他们之间也不会发生流血冲突。然而确实有一种更危险的争端需要说明。

在人类各种强烈的欲望中，使男女两性相互吸引的那种情欲是极度炽热和强烈的，这种可怕的情欲，能够使人不顾危险，冲破一切障碍，等它发展到疯狂的状态的时候，所产生的破坏性足以毁掉整个人类，而它本来却是注定要使人类繁衍的。如果人们沉溺于这种残暴贪婪的情欲之中，没有节制，没有廉耻，每天不惜流血冲突，纠缠于男女之爱的话，那么人将会变成什么样子？

首先必须承认，欲望越强烈，越需要法律的限制。然而，且不说欲望每天给社会带来的混乱和罪恶已经证明法律在这方面的无力，我们还必须认真研究一下，这些罪恶是不是伴随着法律一起产生的。如果是的话，即使法律能够制服这些罪恶，我们要求法律去制服那些没有法律就不会存在的罪恶是没有任何意义的。

我们首先要区分生理上的爱和精神上的爱，生理上的爱是指使两性结合的普遍情欲，而精神上的爱则将这种情欲限定在一个特定的对象上，或者至少使他将更多的注意力放在一个偏爱的对象身上。精神之爱具有社会用途，女性极力颂扬这种感情，以建立自身的权威，而她们是本应处于服从地位的。这种感情建立在对美和价值的特定认识上，而原始人没有这种认识，也不能对之进行比较，因而这种感情在原始人那里是不存在的。原始人头脑中不能形成均衡和规范的抽象观念，因而他们内心不能产生爱慕之情，这些感情也是在这些抽象概念形成之后才产生的微妙感情。原始人只受自然禀性的支配，并不能产生他们无法了解的那些品味，因此每个女人都同样适合他。

原始人仅拥有生理之爱，因而幸运地避免了那些激起人们难以满足的种种欲望的所谓更高级的爱情，他们的情欲更少更平和，因而他们的爱情争端也更少更平和。那些烦扰我们心灵的欲念从来不会干扰到原始人的心灵，他们只是静静地等待自然的冲动，自发地产生情欲，不那么狂热，却十分愉悦，一旦得到满足，他们的情欲就会暂时平息。无须争辩的是，爱情和其他欲望一样，只有在社会中才会变得疯狂，给人类带来灾难。更荒谬的是，有人认为原始人为了满足兽性，不停地相互杀戮，这恰恰与经验相反。迄今为止最接近原始人的加勒比人，他们生活在炎热的气候中，似乎有更强烈的情欲，然而他们的爱情生活是人类中最平和的，他们之间没有任何因嫉妒而起的纷争。

在有些动物中，雄性为争夺雌性而互相厮杀，血溅养殖场；或者，春天的时候，在树林里争吵叫春。在从动物推断到人时，我们必须排除这些动物，因为自然赋予这些动物雌雄之间的对比情况显然不同于人类，我们不能从雄鸡相争的习性中推断出人类的情况。在这些动物中可以清楚地观察到两性的对比，雄性动物之所以争斗，是因为雌性相对于雄性来说数目较少，或者雌性会有一段时间拒绝与雄性交配。因为如果每只雌性动物每年只有两个月与雄性交配，那么就相当于雌性的数目比雄性少了六分之五。对于人类来说，这两种情况都不存在，首先女性的数目往往多于男性，其次，女性中间即使在原始人中也不曾出现像雌性动物一样的发情期和拒排期。另外，这些动物中的几个种类，会在同一个时期同时发情，然后就会出现一个可怕的时期，充满普遍的混乱和喧嚣。这种情况不会发生在人类身上，因为人的性欲不是周期性的，因此我们不能从雄性动物争夺雌性动物的争斗中推论出原始人也是这样。即使这个推理能成立，我们知道，这种争斗也不会使那些动物灭绝，因而没有理由认为它会给人类造成更大的威胁。再清楚不过的是，这种争斗的危害在自然状态中要比在社会状态中少得多，尤其是在那些道德还享有一定声誉的国家里，情人的嫉妒和丈夫的报复使得决斗、谋杀和更悲惨的事情每天都不断发生。正是对夫妻永久忠诚的规定导致通奸的发生，正是名誉和贞操的法律本身助长了淫乱之风，使堕胎蔚然成风。

由以上论述，我们可以得出这样的结论：自然状态中的人，整日游荡于森林中间，没有劳役，没有语言，没有家庭，既不知何谓战争，也不知何谓关系，他们对同类没有任何需求，也没有任何伤害他们的念头，甚至根本不能区分他们谁是谁。因此，原始人自给自足，清心寡欲，他们所拥有的感情和知识与他们的处境相称，他们只能意识到现实的需要，只关注那些必须关注的事物，他们的智力发展也不超过他们的幻想。即便他们偶有发明，也不能传授给别人，因为他们甚至连自己的孩子都不认识，每种技艺都会随着发明者的死亡而消失。由于没有任何形式的教育，下一代人不会比上一代人有所进步，每一代人都从相同的起点开始生活。许多世纪过去了，人类依然生活在原始状态中；人类已经很古老了，而人本身却很幼稚。

我之所以花费如此多的笔墨来阐述我设想的原始状态，是因为在这一问题上有太多由来已久的错误认识和根深蒂固的偏见需要澄清。因此，我认为我有责任深入到问题的本质，通过对自然状态的描述来证明，即使是自然的不平等也不像现在的著述家认为的那样，没有他们认为的那些影响。

事实上，我们很容易看清，人与人之间的那些差别只不过是习惯所致，或者是由人们在适应社会生活时所选择的生活方式不同所造成的，因此一个人体质好坏或者力气大小，往往取决于他的教养方式是艰苦磨炼还是娇生惯养，而不是因为他天生禀性如此。智力的差别也是如此。教育不仅能使受过教育的人和没受过教育的人之间产生差别，而且随着受教育程度的提高，这种差别在受教育者之间也会增大；就像是一个巨人和一个侏儒，在同一条路上行走，他们每走一步，他们之间的距离也就增大一些。自然状态中的人和动物一样，过着完全相同的单调生活，他们吃同样的食物，使用同样的方式，过着同样的生活，我们很容易就能看出，自然状态中的人差别是多么小，而社会状态中不同等级的人差别是多么大，由于教育和生活方式的不同，人类在自然上的不平等被社会制度所造成的不平等加深得多么厉害。

即便自然在赋予人类各种禀性的时候有失公正，那么，在人们彼此之间几乎没有任何联系的情况下，那些受到自然偏爱的人又比其他人多获得了什么好处呢？没有爱情的地方，美丽有什么用处？没有交流的地方，才智有什么用处？没有交易的地方，欺诈又有什么用处呢？我经常听到人们说，在原始状态中，强者压迫弱者，然而他们所说的压迫又是什么意思呢？据他们说，一些人使用暴力压制另一些人，这些人就呻吟着屈从于他们的统治。这种情况在我们现在的社会倒是真的存在，然而我却不明白这种情况如何能推论到原始人那里去。他们连我们所说的统治和屈服这两个词都很难想到。诚然，一个原始人可能抢走别人的水果和猎物，霸占别人用来居住的洞穴，但他如何能够使别人屈服于他呢？如果没有财产，人们之间怎么会有依附关系呢？举个例子，如果有人把我从这棵树下赶走，我可以找另一棵树。如果我在这个地方受到打搅，谁能阻止我到另一个地方去呢？或者，我会不会碰到这样一个人，他不但比我强壮，而且还邪恶、懒惰和凶狠，他强迫我给他提供食物，而他自己却闲着不动？如果有这样一个人，他必定要时刻盯着我，睡觉之前他一定要将我牢牢捆住，否则我一定会猛击他的头部，然后逃掉。这就是说，他必然甘愿让自己陷于无穷无尽的麻烦之中，而这种麻烦比他本想避免的和所强加给我的都要多。而且，他也总有放松警惕的时候，或者听到什么动静回一下头，这时我只需迅速跑出二十步，就会消失在树林中，我解脱了，而他再也不会看见我。

即使我不赘述这些细节，每个人也都能理解，只有在人们相互依赖或者有共同的需要将他们联系在一起的时候，才能产生奴役关系。如果一个人不首先沦落到要依靠别人才能存活的地步，他是不可能成为奴隶的。既然这种情况在自然状态中根本不会出现，每个原始人就都是自己的主人，那么强者法则根本无从生效。

上述已经证明，自然状态中，人们几乎感觉不到不平等的存在，自然的不平等对人们几乎没有什么影响。接下来，我将在人类智慧连续发展的过程中寻找不平等的起源和发展轨迹。上文已经提过，原始人所拥有的自我完善、社会美德和其他各种潜能，只有通过一系列可能不会发生的外部偶然因素才能得到发展。如果没有这些因素，人类也许就永远停留在原始状态中。我必须找到并考察这些偶然因素，它们也许发展了人类的智慧，却败坏了人类本身，它们使人类结成社会，却使人类堕落，这样，它们使人类从遥远的年代最终发展到今天的样子。

必须承认，我将要论述的情景可能是以另一种方式发生的，因而，我是通过猜想来做出选择的，然而这些猜想都是有道理的，因为它们是从事物的性质中能做出的最有可能的猜测，也是发现真相的唯一途径。至于我将推理出的结论，并不仅仅是猜想，因为根据既有的原理，不可能推导出其他的理论，任何别的理论都不能产生同样的结果，也不能得出同样的结论。

有了以上这些，我认为可以不去思考以下这些问题：充足的时间如何使发生各种事件成为可能；轻微的因素如何在偶然持续作用之后产生巨大的力量；在没有既定事实佐证的情况下，某些假设为何不是没有可能；两件既定的历史事实，由一系列或未知或假想的中间事件联系起来，这些中间事件是未知的或者是假想的，那么为什么还可以用来佐证历史；如果没有历史可寻，哲学家推理得到的相似的事件也可以用来佐证历史。最后，在考察各种事实的时候，事物之间的类似性使它们简化为比通常想象的更少的几种类别。以上这些问题就留给评判员去思考吧，而一般读者则完全不需要考虑这些问题。

(20) 自我主义不能与自尊混为一谈，这两者无论就其本质而言，或其产生的影响而言，都是不相同的。自尊是一种自然的感情，它使每种动物都关注自身的生存，在人类中，它为理智所引导，为同情心所节制，从而产生人性和美德。而自我主义则纯粹是一种相对的、非自然的感情，它产生在社会中，它使个人对自己的重视远远超过对任何其他人的重视，使得人们之间相互冲突相互攻击。自我主义是“尊贵感”的真正源头。如果上述理解正确的话，我深信，在原始社会，真正的自然状态中，自我主义并不存在，因为每个人都视自己为自己行为的唯一观察者，他是世界上唯一一个关注自己的人，也是唯一能对自己行为做出评判的人。他内心从来没有想要做任何比较，出于同样的原因，他既不知道怨恨也没有报复的想法，因为这些感情只能由感觉得到的羞辱才能产生。而构成羞辱的是轻蔑或伤害的意图，而不是伤害本身。他既不会评价也不会比较，彼此之间也不会发生暴力行为，除非在适当的时候，他们会相互打斗，但没有被羞辱的感觉。总之，每一个原始人都视自己的同类和其他动物一样，他们可能把弱小的动物当作猎物，也会屈服于比他强壮的人。他们把这些暴力行为看成是很自然的事情，不会有任何侮辱或者轻视的感觉，只对成功或者失败感到高兴或者伤心。（英译者注）

第二部分


文明社会的真正奠基人是这样一个人，他第一个圈起一块地，并想到说：“这是我的！”而且他居然能找到一群头脑简单的人相信他。然而，很有可能没有人站出来，拔掉树桩，填平地沟，向人们喊道：“不要相信这个骗子！你们不要忘记大地上的所有果实都是属于大家的，而土地不属于任何人，如果你们忘了，你们就要遭殃了。”而使人类陷入罪恶、战争和谋杀，沉沦于恐慌和不幸之中(1)。然而，极可能的是，事情已经不可避免地要这样发展，而不可能再像以前一样了，因为在财产的观念产生以前，必定已有许多其他的观念作为铺垫，这些观念不可能是一下子同时产生的，而是连续不断地逐渐获得的。当人类发展到自然状态末期的时候，他们一定已经取得了惊人的进展，获得了大量的知识和技术，这些都需要许多世纪的传播和积累。让我们回到更早的时期，以最自然的顺序，努力将那些缓慢发展的连续事件和发现联系起来。

人类最早的感觉是自己的存在，他们最先关注的是自我保护。大地的产出为他们提供所需之物，而本能告诉他们如何利用这些事物，饥饿和其他原始欲望使他们在不同的时间感受不同的生存体验。这些原始欲望中，有一种促使他们繁衍后代，这对他们来说是一种盲目的倾向，与心智的发展没有任何关系，仅仅是一种动物性的行为。情欲一旦满足，男女之间再也不需要对方，当孩子能独自生活的时候，母亲也就不以其为意了。

这就是人类初期的状况，在这种动物式的生活方式中，人们局限于生理感觉，几乎不能利用自然禀性获得更多的好处，也绝对想不到要向自然索取什么。然而困难很快降临，人们必须学会克服这些困难。树太高，他们无法够到果实，其他动物同他们争夺这些果实，凶猛的野兽想吃掉他们，这些都迫使他们的身体得到磨炼，他们必须灵活、迅速、勇于战斗。树枝、石头等天然武器能够轻易找到，因此他们学会了克服这些自然障碍，在必要时和其他动物争斗，甚至和其他人争夺食物，也学会了补偿自己先前不得不让给强者的那些东西。

随着人口的增多，人们关注的事物也越来越多，土质、气候和季节的差异必然给他们的生活带来不同的影响，荒年、严寒和酷暑都能毁坏土地上的果实，他们不得不发展新的技术。生活在海边和河边的人，发明了钓钩和钓线，就成为渔民，以捕鱼为生；住在森林中的人制造了弓和箭，就变成猎人；在严寒的国度，人们用捕杀的兽皮制作成衣服。雷电、火山或者机缘巧合使人们认识了火，他们因而有了抵御严冬的新工具，后来他们就学会保存火种，再后来，他们就学着如何生火，最终他们学会了用火烤熟肉类，而之前他们只能吃生的。

人与动物以及人与人之间的不断接触，自然而然地使人们觉察到某种关系，这种关系可以用大小、强弱、快慢、怯懦和勇敢这些词来表示，大多是在必要时无意识比较的结果，这些关系最终使人产生某种思考，或者说是一种机械的审慎，这种审慎促使人类为保障自身的安全采取最必要的防备措施。

这种发展的结果是人类产生了新智慧，这种新智慧通过使人类意识到这一点而使人增加了对其他动物的优越感。因而，人类设置了千万种圈套和陷阱，企图诱捕动物，尽管有些动物比人跑得快，有些动物比人强壮，然而最终这些动物不是被人类驯服，就是被人类残杀。这样，当人类第一次回头审视自己的时候，他们就产生了最初的自豪感，尽管这时他们还不知道如何给各种生物划分等级，他们已经将自己这一种类当作最高等级的了，并且，理所当然地把自己当作其中的优秀代表。

诚然，当时的人与人之间的关系不像我们现在一样，人与人之间的交往并不比人与动物的交往更多，但他们仍不会忽视对同类的观察，久而久之，他们就能发现他们之间以及男人与女人之间的共同点。当他们发现在同种情况下，其他人的做法和他们完全相同时，他们就自然而然地猜想别人的思维方式和行动方式也都和他们完全相同。这个重要的发现，一旦深深印入他们的脑海，就会在他们头脑中形成一种比推理更确定却远远更快速的直觉，促使他们追寻一种对自身的安全和利益最有利的行为方式。

经验告诉他们，人类活动的唯一动机就是追求自身幸福。因而，人能区分两种情况：一种是，在少数情况下，由于共同的利益，他们可以依靠同伴的帮助；在另一种情况下——这种情况更为少见——由于彼此的利益发生冲突，他们便不能相信同伴。在前一种情况下，人们之间结合成群体，或者至少松散地结合在一起，这种结合对成员没有任何约束，而且只要临时结合的需要一旦满足，它立即就会解散。在后一种情况下，每个人都只顾自己的利益，如果他认为自己足够强壮，他就会公开使用武力，如果他认为自己不够强壮，他就会使用谄媚或诡计。

这样一来，人类不知不觉获得了一种关于相互之间的义务以及履行这种义务获得的好处的模糊观念。然而，这也仅限于在遇到眼前的利益或者显而易见的利益时，他们才能想得到，因为他们完全不懂得为将来做打算，也不情愿为将来的事多费心思，甚至不能想到第二天的事情。如果想抓住一只鹿，每个人都明白，他们必须坚守岗位，然而如果恰巧一只野兔从他们中的一个人面前跑过，毫无疑问，那个人会毫不犹豫地追上去，抓住这只野兔，至于他这样做使得同伴们失去了一只鹿，他也毫不在意。

不难理解，人类这种交往使他们发展的语言，不会比一群乌鸦或者猴子聚集起来为了同样的目的发出的叫喊更精细。很长一个时期，人类普遍使用的语言一定只是含糊不清的叫喊、大量的手势和一些模仿性的声音。此外，在不同的地方，一些特定的发音方式（正如我最初说过的，语言的最初构成总是不那么容易解释清楚的）会导致特定语言的产生。然而这些语言必定是非常粗糙和不完善的，就像现在发现的某些原始民族中使用的语言一样。

在社会开始的时期，由于时间太过久远，所述的事物繁杂多样，事情的进展又极其缓慢，因而，我只能对最初的许多世纪做最简略的说明，因为事情越是进展缓慢，对过程的描述就越是应该简洁。

最初的收获促使人们加速发展其他能力，他们思想开化的同时，也变得勤劳，他们不会再随便找一棵树就躺下睡觉，也不会随便找个洞避避风雨。他们发明了几种锐利坚硬的石器，用来挖土、砍树，然后他们用树枝搭起了茅棚，最终学会了在茅棚上盖上一层泥土。这就是人类第一个划时代的变革，人类建立了家庭，形成了某种形式的私有制，也给自己带来了无穷无尽的争吵和冲突。然而，建造了第一座房屋的一定是最强壮的人，因为他自以为有能力保护他的房屋，不被他人抢走，而弱小的人会发现模仿他建一座房屋要比抢一座房屋更容易也更安全。一旦建造了自己的房屋，他们就不会企图抢夺其他人的房屋了，并不是因为他们认为那不是他的，而是因为他们并不需要，而且，如果他们想抢占别人的房屋，就必然会和那一家人发生激烈的争斗。

人类的心灵因新鲜的环境刺激而发展，这种新鲜的环境就是指使夫与妻、父与子结合在一起的家庭(2)。长久住在一起，人们便产生了人类最美好的感情：夫妻之间的爱情和父亲对子女的亲情。每个家庭都是一个团结的小社会，自由和相互之间的感情是他们唯一的纽带。原本具有相同生活方式的男女两性，逐渐适应了新的生活方式，女性变得更加稳定安静，她们习惯了持家和照顾子女，而男性则外出为家人谋求生活必需品。(3)由于生活变得舒适，男女两性不再强壮敏捷，然而，当个人在某种程度上不再能独自与野兽抗衡的时候，人们却发现，联合起来对付野兽更容易些。

新环境中的人，生活简朴而独立，需求甚少，他们发明的一些工具能满足日常之需，因而他们拥有大量的空闲时间，在这大量的空闲时间内，他们为自己创造了父辈们所没有的各种享受，同时却无意识中为自己戴上一副枷锁，也为子孙后代引来了罪恶之源。这是因为，这些享受不断败坏人的身体和思想，而且随着它们的滥用而不再是享受，它们成了人们的现实需求。最后人们在失去这些享受之后产生的不愉快远远胜过他们得到时的快乐。人们会为失去这些享受而伤心，尽管拥有这些享受并不能使他们幸福(4)。

现在我们可以更清晰地看出，语言的运用是如何开始并在家庭中缓慢发展的。因而，我们可以推测，各种不同的因素使语言变得越来越必要，从而扩大和加速了语言的发展。洪水泛滥和地震使人们的栖居地被悬崖峭壁和洪水包围，地球的运动使大陆的某些部分分割为一块块的岛屿。不难想象，由于这些原因而不得不聚集在一起的人们，比起在森林中游荡的人们更容易发展出共同的语言，因此，极有可能的是岛民在最初航行之后，将语言的使用带到了大陆。至少，在大陆上的人知道什么是语言和社会之前，这两者就已经在岛屿上产生了，甚至还逐渐完善起来。

至此，事物的方方面面都开始发生变化，此前一直游荡在丛林中的人们开始定居，逐渐聚集形成各种集团，最终每一个地域都产生了一个由共同的性格和生活方式联系的特定的民族，而这些民族的形成不是由于法令和法律，而是由于有相同的生活方式、饮食方式，并受着共同气候的影响。长期邻近的生活最终难免使各个家庭之间产生某些联系，年轻的男女，比邻而居，最初使他们结合的那种自然的冲动，使他们由临时的关系逐渐转变为亲密而持久的关系。人们开始比较不同的事物，不知不觉获得了关于美和价值的观念，继而产生偏爱的感情。由于持续不断地见面，他们就难以忍受不能经常见面的痛苦，一种温柔而愉悦的感情悄然进入他们的心间。一点儿矛盾就会引起强烈的不满，爱情激起了嫉妒之心，情侣一旦反目，生命就会成为柔情的祭品。

伴随着观念和情感的相互推进，心灵和精神开始活跃，人类逐渐抛弃原始的粗野状态，他们受到的限制越多，彼此之间的联系也就越多，他们习惯于围在屋前的大树旁唱歌跳舞，爱情和闲暇的真正果实成为娱乐，甚至成为男人女人们聚集在一起唯一可做的事情。每个人都开始关注别人，也希望得到别人的关注，因而人们之间形成一种普遍的价值：那些最能歌善舞的人，最漂亮的人，最强壮的人，最灵巧的人或口才最好的人会受到最多的关注。这就是迈向不平等的第一步，也是迈向罪恶的第一步。在最初的差别中，虚荣和蔑视产生了，羞耻和嫉妒也产生了，新的生活所引起的混乱将原始的天真和幸福一起终结了。

一旦人们开始相互品评，尊重的观念便在人的心底扎根，每个人都要求别人尊重他，再也没有人在不尊重他人的时候还能安然无恙。由此，原始人当中产生了最初的对礼貌的要求，每一种故意的伤害都成为一种侮辱，因为不仅伤痛产生了，每个人还会将受到的伤害当作一种对他个人的侮辱，这往往比伤害本身更难以忍受。

这样，每个人对所遭受的轻蔑所施的报复与他对自己尊重的程度成正比，因而，报复成为一种可怕的行为，而人也变得冷酷残忍。这正是我们现在所知道的大部分原始民族所处的状态。正因为我们头脑中缺乏对原始民族合适的定位，无视他们已经距自然状态很远的事实，许多著述者才轻率地得出结论说，人天生残忍，需要文明加以教化才能变温和。然而事实上，再没有比自然状态中的人更温和的了，自然给他们订立的位置，距离动物的愚昧和文明人不幸的智慧同样遥远。原始人受到本能和理性的同等制约，一心考虑对自身安全所可能产生的种种威胁，天然的同情心约束着他们不去做任何伤害他人的事情，甚至在他们受到伤害的时候也不会想到要报复。智者洛克(5)有句格言：“没有私有制，就没有伤害。”

我们必须注意，新形成的社会以及人们之间建立的联系，都要求人们具有一种不同于人类在原始状态中的品质，人类的活动已经显现出道德的影响。在法律建立之前每个人都是自己所受伤害的唯一评判员和复仇者。这样一来，自然状态中所需要的善良不再适用于新诞生的社会。人们之间的碰撞越来越频繁，复仇手段也越来越残忍，对复仇的恐惧起到了严酷法律的作用。尽管人们越来越没有耐性，尽管人们的同情心已经减弱，然而人类能力扩展的这个时期正处于自然状态的闲散和现在的强烈的自我主义的一种中间状态，这一定是人类最幸福最稳定的一个时代。我们越是思考这个问题，就越会发现这个时期最不容易发生变革，并且也是人类经历的所有时代中最美好的一个，除非发生偶然的不幸事故，他们绝不会脱离这个状态，并且若为全人类的幸福考虑，这些偶然事件最好永远不要发生。我们发现的原始人大多生活在这种状态中，他们的生活证明，人类本应一直处于这种状态，这才是人类真正的青春时代，所有后来的进步虽然都似乎使作为个体的人一步步走向完善，却使人类整体上迈向老朽。

只要人们还满足于他们简陋的茅屋，只要人们还满足于穿着用荆棘和鱼骨缝制的兽皮，只要人们还满足于仅仅用羽毛和贝壳来装饰自己，只要人们还愿意继续用颜料涂满全身，继续美化和改善他们的弓箭，继续用尖石制造渔船、打磨粗笨的乐器，总之，只要他们还仅限于从事那些靠一个人就能完成的技艺，而不需要从事需要几个人合作才能完成的任务，他们就能自由、健康、诚实、幸福地生活。只要他们的本性愿意，他们就能继续享受自由相互交往的生活。然而，在人们需要他人帮助的那一刻起，从一个人发现拥有两份食物的好处时，平等就不存在了，私有制就产生了。劳役成为不可避免的了，广阔的森林变成了需要人的血汗灌溉的茂盛田野，奴役和悲伤随着庄稼一起发芽生长。

冶铁和农业技术促成了这种变革。教化了人、却败坏了整个人类的，诗人告诉我们是黄金和白银，而哲学家告诉我们是铁具和谷物。美洲的原始人对这两者一无所知，因而他们依然是原始人，若其他民族只掌握其中的一种技术，那么他们似乎也不能冲破原始状态。欧洲之所以有着比其他地方更为持久、更加高度发展的文明，最好的解释就是那里曾经盛产铁矿和谷物。

很难想象人类最初如何认识和使用了铁，在人们不知道会产生什么结果之前，很难设想他们会挖出铁矿将它们处理好并投入熔炉。然而，也不能设想某次偶然的火灾导致了这种发明，因为铁矿只存在于没有树木植物的贫瘠之地。由此可知，自然似乎竭力不想让我们发现这个不幸的秘密。因此，只有在某种极不寻常的情况下，某次火山爆发，喷射出熔化的金属物质，向看到这一切的人昭示了模仿自然炼铁的方法。此外，我们还需要进一步设想，这些人一定拥有非比寻常的勇气和先见之明，能承受如此繁重的劳动和预见到相当长一段时间之后能从中获益。这些都需要发达的智慧，当时的发明者应比我们设想的聪明得多。

农业的原理，远在人们开始实践之前就应该已经为人们所掌握了，人们不断地从植物中获取食物，几乎不可能不了解自然为使植物繁衍而使用的方式。然而，也许在很久之后，人们才开始经营农业，也许因为树木和渔猎不同，不需要人们特别关注即能生产食物，也许因为人们忽视了谷物的作用，或者没有工具来种植，也许因为他们不能预见将来的需求，最后，也许因为他们没有办法阻止别人抢走他们的劳动果实。

当人类变得更加勤劳以后，我们自然认为他们已经开始借助尖利石器和削尖的木棒在茅屋周围种植一些蔬菜或根茎类植物。在很长一段时间之后，人们才懂得如何种植谷物，或者拥有大量种植谷物所必需的工具。更不必说，对于农业耕作来说，必须愿意牺牲即时的需求以换取将来的收获，这种远见是原始人所不能拥有的，正如我已经说过的，他们早晨起来几乎连晚上需要什么都想不到。

对于人类从事农业而言，其他的许多技术发明就变得有必要。有了熔炼和打铁的工匠之后，就得有人来供养他们。需要食物的人口没有发生变化，从事制造业的人越多，提供生活资料的人就越少。一些人需要用农产品来换取铁制工具，所以另一些人就必然发现了用铁具增加农产品的办法。这样，一方面经营和耕种技术得以建立，另一方面，金属加工和铁具的使用得以推广。

土地的耕种必然引起土地的分配问题，而私有财产的出现，一旦被承认，就必然会带来最早的公正法则。因为要保护个人的财产，人们必须首先拥有一些东西。此外，人们开始为将来做打算，每个人都可能失去一些东西，因而人们都有理由不去伤害别人，以防止随之而来的报复。这种起源是合乎自然的，因为我们不能撇开人的劳动而思考私有财产的产生。除了加入自己的劳动，人还能添加什么让他有理由将并非他创造的东西据为己有呢？正是农夫的劳动赋予他权利获得他耕种的土地上的产出，也是劳动使他至少到收获时占有土地本身。然后年复一年，这种持续的占有就很容易转化为私有财产。格劳秀斯说(6)，古代人赋予塞莱斯（谷神）以立法者的称号，并且将纪念她的节日称为“黛丝摩芙里”，这表明人们通过土地的分配获得了一种权利，即：对财产的所有权，这和自然法中的权利不同。

事情发展到这个状态，如果人们的才能相同，平等就可能会持续下去，比如，人们对铁具的使用和农产品的消费总能保持精确的平衡。然而，实际上，没有什么能保持这种平衡，因而，这种平衡很快就被打破了。强壮的人劳动所得较多，熟练工能从工作中获得更多收入，聪明的人设法减轻劳动，农夫需要更多的铁具或者铁匠需要更多的谷物。即便是同样的劳动，一个人可以获得较多收入，而另一个人则难以糊口。这样，自然的不平等随着彼此的联系不知不觉加深了，这种人与人之间的差别通过他们不同的境遇逐渐加大，其影响更加显著，更加持久，并相应地开始影响个人的命运。

事情一旦发展到这种地步，接下来的事情就不难想象了，我无须再向读者描述相继发明的其他技艺，语言的发展，才能的试验和运用，机遇的不平等，财富的利用和滥用，还有与之相关的所有细节，这些读者自己都能轻易加以补充。我将仅仅概括这个新时期中人类的状况。

这时，人类所有的能力都得到了发展，记忆力和想象力全面展开，人们更加关注自我，并能进行理性思考，思维能力已经达到了完善的制高点。这时一个人所有与生俱来的东西都在发挥作用，人与人之间有了等级和出身的区别，这些区别不仅包括个人财富的多少，能影响他人的能力的大小，也在于个人的才智、美丽、体力、技术、价值和智慧，只有这些品质才能得到别人的尊重。不久之后，这些品质就成为人们必须拥有或者最起码假装拥有的东西了。

如今人们的兴趣是假装成他原本不是的那种样子。“本来就是”和“看起来是”成为两种完全不同的东西(7)，于是从这种区别中产生了傲慢的虚荣和欺骗伎俩，数不尽的罪恶也开始相继上演。另一方面，从前自由而独立的个人，如今在一连串新产生的欲望的催动下，开始依赖别人，既不得不受自然的支配，更不得不受他人的支配：富人需要别人的服侍，穷人需要别人的资助，不穷不富的人也不能脱离他人的支配。因此，一个人必须不断设法使别人关注他的利益，让别人认为显然（即使事实并非如此）帮助他，就会给他们自己带来收益。这样，他就会对一些人阴险狡诈，对另一些人蛮横残忍。当他既不能恐吓别人服从他，又认为帮助别人没有好处的时候，欺骗所有他需要的人就成为必需的了。难填的欲壑，对财富的热望，与其说是出于真实的需要，不如说是出于对超越别人的渴望。这些欲望，激发人们产生相互伤害的阴险意图，以及一种隐秘的嫉妒。这种嫉妒更为可怕，它使人们带上伪善的面具，从而更加稳妥地实现自己的欲望。总之，一方面是竞争和对抗，另一方面是人们之间的利益冲突，人人暗藏损人利己之心。这一切灾难都是私有制的最初结果，也是不平等发展的必然产物。

在代表财富的符号发明之前，财富仅仅指土地和牲畜，这是人们拥有的唯一真正的财产。然而，当这些财产在数量和范围上不断扩张占据整个地球的时候，人们的土地彼此相邻，一个人只有通过损害他人的财产才能扩大自己的财富。同时，那些多余的人，他们或者太虚弱或者太懒惰，不能有所收获，尽管没有失去什么，却变成了穷人，因为他们周围的一切都在改变，而他们依然如故，于是他们不得不从富人那里接受施舍或者偷来食物。这样一来，根据他们不同的性格，就产生了统治和奴役，暴力和劫掠。对于富人来说，他们一旦体会到统治的乐趣，就会鄙弃其他一切乐趣，就像一群饿狼，一旦尝到了人肉的滋味，就再也不想吃其他食物了。他们使用旧的奴隶来占有新的奴隶，他们一心只想征服和奴役邻居。

这样，强权者和弱势者都将他们的强权和贫穷视为一种针对他人财富的一种权利，在他们看来，这种权利就是一种财产所有权。平等一旦遭到破坏，最可怕的混乱就会随之而来。富人和穷人之间相互劫掠，他们不受约束的欲望压制了天然的同情心，也使得很脆弱的公正受到严重打击，它们带给人们的只有贪婪、野心和邪恶。最强者和先占者之间持续不断地发生冲突，不发展到战争和杀戮绝不罢休。新生的社会，因而陷入可怕的战争状态，人们就这样陷入无尽的折磨之中，堕落下去，再也不能停下脚步，再也不能摆脱这些不幸的所得。人们汲汲于滥用那些能给自己带来荣誉的种种能力，结果却迷失了自我，将自己一步步推向毁灭的边缘。

这种新奇的灾难使他惶恐。他固然富有了，但是很可怜，他想逃避财富，他痛恨他不久前还在祈求的东西。(8)

人们不可能始终不考虑他们这种悲惨的处境，也不可能从不考虑那些折磨人的灾难。尤其是富人，他们一定能够想到，他们为连绵不断的战争付出了多大的代价，尽管所有人都可能为之付出生命，但只有他们可能付出财富。此外，无论他们如何为自己的巧取豪夺进行辩护，他们都明白他们的财富的基础本来就是不稳定也不是正当的，因而，如果有人用武力夺走他们本来用武力夺来的财富，他们也没有理由抱怨什么。即使是通过勤劳致富，人们也很难为自己的财产做更好的辩护，即便是这样说也徒然：“我建了这堵墙，这块土地是我劳动所得。”然而，我们可以这样反问：你占有的土地是谁给你的？没有人要求你劳动，你有什么权力向大家索取报酬呢？难道你不知道，就因为你占有太多才导致别人挨饿吗？如果你想获得超出你生存所需的部分，难道你不应该征求全体人民的一致同意(9)吗？富人既缺乏有效的理由，也没有足够的力量来自卫，他能轻松制服一个人，却也能轻松地被一群强盗制服。富人是以一个人来对抗全体人民的。此外，他和与他同等的人之间相互嫉妒，因而富人们不能联合起来对付数不清的联合起来抢劫的人们。迫于形势的压力，富人们最终想到一个人类智慧所能想到的最为深谋远虑的计划，这个计划使他们的敌人变成对他们有利的人——联合所有的反对者，给他们灌输新的观念，为他们建立新的制度。这些制度对富人有利就像自然法对他们不利一样。

怀着这种目的，富人就向邻居们讲述一种可怕的情景：如果每个人都武装起来对抗其他人，那么每个人的需求都和他们的财产一样成为沉重的负担，这样，无论是富人还是穷人，都不可能得到安宁。在讲完之后，富人轻而易举地编造一个冠冕堂皇的理由，诱惑别人实现他的目的。他说：“让我们联合起来吧，保护弱者免受压迫，制约强者的野心，使每个人的财产都毫无例外地受到保护。让我们建立维护公正和和平的规则，人人遵守，让强者和弱者一样相互承担义务，以在某种程度上弥补命运的不公。总之，我们不能和自己作对，我们必须联合起来汇集成一个至高无上的权力，让它通过智慧的法律来治理我们，保护这个共同体中的每一个成员，抵御共同的敌人，维持我们永恒的和谐关系。”

其实，要使这群愚昧、容易受骗的人相信他的话，他远远不需要说这么多，尤其因为这些人之间有太多的纷争，没有裁判他们根本无法解决，并且他们又有太多的野心和贪欲，没有主人他们简直不能长期生存下去。于是，一听到召唤，他们就急不可耐地奔向他们的枷锁，希望这个枷锁可以保障他们的自由，因为他们虽然有足够的智慧来理解政治制度的好处，却没有足够的经验来预测它的弊端。而最有能力预测这种弊端的人，却正是希望从中获益的那些人。即使是最精明的人也认为，牺牲一部分自由来保障另一部分自由也不是不可行，正如一个受伤的人砍掉自己的胳膊来保全身体的其余部分一样。

这就是社会和法律的起源，或者说这是社会和法律应有的起源，穷人获得了一副新的枷锁，而富人获得了一些新的权力。天然的自由彻底被摧毁了，而保障私有制和不平等的法律却永远固定下来，这种法律将富人的巧取豪夺变成一种不可变更的特权，为了少数野心家的利益，使全人类陷入无穷无尽的劳苦、奴役和悲惨的境地。这样，我们就容易明白，一个社会的建立如何使其他社会的建立成为必然，也明白了，为了对抗联合的力量，所有受压迫的人应该如何联合起来。每个社会都迅速膨胀，不久就充满整个地球，直到地球上几乎再也找不到一个地方，能够使人们摆脱枷锁，将自己的头颅从一直一线相悬在他头上的利剑下移开。市民权利已经成为每个社会成员的共同法则，而自然法则仅仅存在于各个社会之间，它以万国法的名义出现(10)，由默认的惯例加以限制，使社会之间的交流成为现实，并且替代了自然的同情心。这种同情心，在社会中已经失去了对人类的大部分影响，如今仅仅存在于一些伟大的世界主义者的精神深处，他们打破了阻碍各民族人民交流的思想樊篱，模仿伟大造物主的样子，将全人类都包容在他们的仁慈之中。

然而，政治组织之间的关系虽依然处于自然状态中，但不久这种状态给政府带来的种种不便就使得它们不得不摆脱这种状态，正如个人不得不放弃它一样。因为，这种状态对大型政府之间的关系造成的破坏比对个人更大。由此就产生了一系列使理性和自然都震怒的民族战争、杀戮和相互报复，以及所有那些以杀人为美德标准的可怕偏见，因而，最正直的人们也把相互残杀当作职责，最终人们大规模屠杀自己的同类，却不知道为了什么。战争中一天杀死的人数和攻占一座城池所使用的暴力，比在自然状态中所有时代整个地球杀害的人和使用的暴力还要多得多。这就是将人类分裂成不同的社会造成的首要后果。然而，我们还是回到政府创立的最初吧。

我了解到许多著述者对政治社会的起源给出了很多种其他的解释，例如，认为政治起源于强者的征服，或者起源于弱者的联合。事实上，这些都与我用以论证政府起源的论据没有任何关系。我上文提到的原因，对于我来说是最符合自然的，我这样认为基于以下几个理由：一、对于第一种说法，征服的权利本身并不是一种权利，因此我们不能据此推出其他的权利。除非被征服者完全恢复了自由，甘愿推举征服者做他们的首领，否则，征服者与被征服者之间永远只能处于战争状态，因为无论此前他们建立了怎样的投降协定，都是建立在暴力的基础上的，由这一点就知道它是无效的，从这个条件出发不可能建立真正的社会或者政府组织，除了强者法则，也不会产生任何法律(11)。二、对于第二种说法，因为强和弱这两个词本身的含义就是不明确的，在财产所有权或先占者的权力的建立与政治治理的中间时期，倒不如用富和穷这两个词来代替强和弱。因为，事实上，在法律建立以前，一个人要想使另一个与他平等的人服从他，除了抢占他的财产或把自己的财产分给他一部分之外就没有别的办法了。三、因为穷人除了自由之外没有别的东西可以失去了，除非他们疯狂到无以复加，否则绝不会无偿地抛弃他们唯一的财产（自由）。而在富人方面，可以这么说，他们会对自己的财富慎之又慎，反而使他们最容易受到损害。因此，富人们更有必要采取一些防备措施保护自己的财产不受损失。总之，更为合理的假设是：只有对一个人有利的事物他才有可能去创造，而对一个人有害的事物，他是不可能去创造的。

政府创立之初，没有稳定正规的组织形式，由于经验和哲学思想的双重缺乏，人们只能看到眼前的弊端，而其他的弊端只有在它们出现之后，人们才能想到去解决。尽管英明的立法者尽了一切努力，政治状态仍然不完善，因为它简直就是偶然出现的。由于政府从刚建立起就存在问题，尽管时间能显露它的缺陷，并向人们昭示一些改善措施，然而，政府创立时就产生的缺陷永远无法弥补。人们只是不断地修修补补，而不能像斯巴达的莱格古士一样，首先扫清地面，清除一切老朽的材料，以便建立一个稳固持久的大厦。社会最初仅仅是由一些一般公约组成的，每个人都能遵守这些公约，因为共同体自身能够保障每个人都能遵守公约。然而，经验仅仅证明了这种制度的脆弱，并且当只有全体成员才能审查和判决的时候，人们的违规行为就难以被认定，因而，违规者能轻易逃避惩罚。人们只会千方百计地逃避法律的制约，混乱和不便也只会持续不断地增多，直到某一天，人们才觉得有必要冒险将公众的权力交给个人，让法官来考虑如何保证对公约的遵守。如果说在人们结盟以前就已经选出了首领，或者在法律产生之前就有了法官，这种荒唐的假设简直不值得认真考虑。

然而，我们也没有道理设想，人们从一开始就坚决地、无条件地投入一个专制主人的怀抱，也不能设想桀骜不驯的人们想到的第一个维护公共安全的方法就是直接奔向奴隶制。事实上，如果不是为了免受压迫，保护他们的生命、自由和财产，也就是说保护构成他们生存基础的事物，他们有什么理由要选出一个统治者呢？考虑到人与人之间的关系，一个人所能遭遇的最不幸的事大概就是任自己听凭别人的支配，那么，为了让别人保护他的财产，他却一开始就将仅有的财产送给别人，这难道不是违背情理的吗？如果他将支配自己的权力让给首领，他的首领又能给他带来什么回报呢？如果这个首领以保护他为由，可以随意支配他的财产和他的人身自由，那么他可以完全嘲讽地回答：“我的敌人对我也不过如此吧！”因而，毋庸置疑，人们选出首领是为了保护自己的自由，而不是为了奴役自己，这是全部政治法的基本准则。普林尼对图拉真说：“我们需要国王，是因为我们不想要主人。”(12)

政客们关于热爱自由的诡辩和哲学家们关于自然状态的诡辩是一样的，他们根据自己了解的事物，来判断他们不了解的性质迥异的事物。他们认为，人天生就有奴性，因为据他们的观察，奴隶似乎看上去能够忍受奴役。然而，他们不曾想过，自由正像淳朴和美德一样，只有拥有它们的人们才能了解其价值，而当人们失去了它们的时候，他们也同时失去了对它们的兴趣。布拉西达斯(13)对一位总督说：“我知道你们国家的幸福，你却不能体会我们那里的快乐。”因为这位总督想将斯巴达的生活和波斯波利斯城(14)的生活做对比。

烈马看到马勒会立刻竖起鬃毛，奋蹄抓地，猛地后退去挣脱，而驯服的马则耐心地忍受鞭笞和踢马刺的痛苦。同样的道理，文明人毫无怨言默默忍受奴役，原始人却不会低下他们的头颅，他们鄙弃用奴役换来的和平，而选择用暴力换取自由。因此，我们不能从被奴役的人们那里来判断人类的天性是接受奴役还是反对奴役，而应该从一切自由民族为反抗压迫做出了多么巨大的努力来进行推测。我知道，前者不停地歌颂他们在锁链下享受的平静生活，他们将悲惨的奴隶生活称为安宁：“悲惨的奴役，被他们称为和平。”(15)然而，我看到后者为了这唯一的财富（丧失了这种财富的人却十分鄙视这种财富）不惜牺牲快乐、安宁、金钱、权利甚至生命。当我看到天生自由的动物，由于天生对束缚的憎恨，将自己的头撞向牢笼的铁栅，当我看到无数蔑视欧洲淫逸生活的原始人，赤裸着身体，忍受着饥饿、战火、刀剑和死亡来保卫他们的自由和独立的时候，我深深地感到，奴隶是不配谈论自由的。

关于父权，许多著述者认为，专制政府和整个社会都是由父权派生出来的(16)。我无须征引与洛克和锡得尼完全相同的论据，就可以指出，世界上再也没有比父权的温和与专制政府的残暴之间差距更大的了，因为服从者从父权中得到的好处远比从掌权者那里得到的好处多得多。根据自然法则，父亲只在他的孩子需要他帮助的时候，他才是孩子的主人，等孩子长大完全独立的时候，他们就是平等的了，他对父亲只有尊敬而不必服从，因为报恩是一种应尽的责任而不是他人能够强求的权利。不应该说社会来源于父权，而应该说父权的主要力量来源于文明社会。只有当子女聚集在他身边的时候，他才能被认为是这些孩子的父亲。父亲是他自己财产的真正主人，他的财产使他的孩子依附于他，除非孩子们顺从他的意志，使他感到满意，否则，他可以不给他们任何财产。然而，臣民则丝毫不能指望从他们的君主那里得到任何类似的恩惠，他们的财产以及他们本身都是属于君主的，至少君主本人这样认为。因此，当君主将少量财富留给他们的时候他们还得感恩戴德，君主让他们活着就是一种恩惠，剥削他们也是一种公正。

如果从权利出发，继续探寻事实，我们就会发现专制政权的建立来源于人民自愿的说法毫无道理可言。同样，我们也难以证明这种契约的有效性。如果只有缔结契约的一方承担所有风险，而另一方完全没有义务，这样，只有承担义务的那一方受到损害。这种可憎的制度，即使在今天也远远不同于明智优良的君主制，尤其是法国的君主制，这一点可以从他们的法令中看出，特别是在1667年以路易十四的名义并根据他的敕令出版的一部著名法律中，有这样一段文字：

所以，绝不能说，国王可以不遵守他自己国家的法律，因为这句话的反面，正是万国法中的一条真理。尽管谄媚者可能攻击这个真理，但一个好的国王应该像国家的保护神那样永远捍卫这条真理。如果我们能像智者柏拉图那样说：国王最大的幸福就是臣民服从国王，国王服从法律，而法律永远公正地为民众谋幸福，那该多么合理啊！(17)

我不想继续追问，既然自由是人最高贵的权利，那么，如果仅仅为了取悦于一个疯狂或残忍的主人竟完全抛弃造物主赐予我们的最珍贵的礼物，听从主人的命令做尽造物主禁止我们做的罪恶，这是不是自甘堕落，将自己贬低到动物的水平，做本能的奴隶呢？或者，这又是不是对造物主的一种侮辱？或许，伟大的造物主宁愿看到他的作品被彻底毁掉也不愿遭受如此侮辱。如果反对者允许，我将不再详细引用巴尔贝拉克的权威说法，他根据洛克的观点，直率地指出：人出卖自己的自由的极点，就是使自己屈从于一个专制权威，由他任意使用自己。他补充道：因为这就相当于出卖自己的生命，而他并不是自己生命的主人。我想问问，那些不怕把自己贬低到如此程度的人们，他们有什么权利让他们的后代也遭此耻辱？他们有什么权利代替他的后代放弃那些并非他本人赠予的幸福？对于所有值得拥有那些幸福的人来说，一旦失去这些幸福，生命本身就会成为一种负担。

普芬道夫说，我们可以为了别人的利益放弃自己的自由，就像我们可以通过契约和协议将财产转让给别人一样。这种推理似乎并不能成立，因为，首先，我放弃的财产和我相分离，如果别人滥用它也与我无关；然而，如果别人滥用我的自由，就不可能与我无关，如果别人让我去犯罪，我就不能不去犯罪，那么我就会成为犯罪的工具，我会满怀罪恶感。其次，所有权只不过是一种制度的约定，只要愿意，他们可以放弃任何财产；然而，人类主要的天然禀赋，生命和自由，则全然不同，这些天赋每个人都可以享用，但是否有权抛弃则是值得怀疑的。如果抛弃自由，我们就贬低了我们的生命，如果抛弃生命，我们就完全失去了生命。世间没有任何财富能弥补这两者的损失，无论以任何财富来换取生命和自由都是违反理性和自然的。即便我们能够像转交财产一样将自由转交给别人，但当涉及孩子的时候，又应另当别论。孩子享有父亲的财富，仅仅因为父亲将权利转移给他们，然而孩子作为人的自由是由自然赋予的，他们的父母完全没有权利剥夺这种自由。正如要建立奴隶制，就必然会违反自然，而要维持奴役的权利，就必须改造自然。那些郑重宣布奴隶的孩子生来就是奴隶的法学家等于宣布人生来就不是人(18)。

因此，我确信，政府不是从专制权力开始的，相反，专制权力却是政府堕落的最终形态。它使政府又返回到强者法则，而政府本是为了补救这一法则而建立的。然而，即使政府以这种方式开始，这种权力本身就是不合理的，不能把它当作社会各种法则的基础，因而也不能把它当作不平等的基础。

这里，我不想深究所有政府基本契约的性质，我将仅仅采用一般观点，将政治组织的建立视为民众与他们选举出来的首领之间达成的真正契约，他们双方都约束自己遵守其中规定的法律，而这种法律则是联结他们双方的纽带。人们在一切社会关系上既已将他们的意志集中成为一个单一意志，那么对这个单一意志做出解释的一些条款就构成了根本法，国家的全体成员都必须毫无例外地遵守根本法，并且根本法中其中的一个条款规范着监督其他法律官员的选任和权限。根本法的权力包括一切维护宪法的职权，但不包括修改宪法的权力。这一切都必须伴之以荣誉，以保证法律和执法者受到公众的尊重。此外，执法者还应享受一些特权，以补偿他们为管理好国家事务所付出的精力和劳动。对于执法者来说，他必须按委托人的意志来行使委托人赋予他的权力，要保证每个人都能安全地享有他们所应享有的一切权利，并且在任何情况下，他们都必须将公众的利益置于个人利益之上。

在经验还没有证明以前，或者说在人们的知识还不能使他们预见到这种宪法不可避免的弊端之前，它似乎就是一部最好的宪法，因为负责维护宪法的官员本身就与宪法有着最密切的利益关系。根本法是官位设置和职权设定的唯一根据，根本法一旦消失，官员们的存在就完全失去合理性，而人们也无须再服从他们的命令。因为国家存在的基础是法律而不是官员，因而当法律不存在的时候，人们就重新获得天赋的自由权利。

只要我们稍加注意，就会发现新的证据来支持这种说法，并且从契约的性质本身也能证实这种契约并不是不能解除的。因为如果没有一种最高权威来保障缔约的双方遵守契约，或者强制他们履行相互间的允诺，那么双方都能依据自己的理由做出判断，而且双方总有一种权利解除契约，只要一方发现对方违反规定或者这种契约不再符合他的利益。正是根据这一原理，人们才可能有解除契约的权利。现在，如果我们仅仅考察这种制度中的人，我们就会确信，如果掌握一切权力、享受契约的所有好处的官员能够有权放弃自己的权威，那么可能承受长官们一切错误决策后果的人民(19)更应该有权拒绝服从。然而，这种弃权的权利是非常危险的，它必然会导致可怕的无穷的纷争和混乱。这些都表明，人类的政府需要一个远比理性更为坚实的根基，同时也表明为了公众的安宁多么需要一个神圣的意志，给最高权威赋予一种神圣不可侵犯的品质，从而可以剥夺臣民危险的弃权的权利。从这一点来看，即使宗教有种种弊端而没有为世人带来其他好处，人也有责任去皈依和信仰宗教，因为它使人类免除的种种残杀远比因宗教狂热付出的生命要多得多。然而，还是让我们沿着原来假定的线索推论下去吧。

政府组织形式的区别，取决于在创立之初人与人之间等级分化的程度的差异，如果那时人们中间恰巧只有一个人无论在权力、品德、财富还是在个人影响力上都非常杰出，那么他就会被选为唯一的执政者，这个政府就是君主制的；而如果有一群人都同样杰出，高于一般民众，那么他们就一起被选为一个团体，这就形成贵族统治的政府；又或者，人们刚刚脱离自然状态不久，无论财富或者才干都比较相当，那么，他们就共同组成一个最高的政权，这便是民主政府(20)。只有经历时间的考验，人们才能发现哪种政府最适合他们。一些民族会一直保持着对法律的遵守，公民努力维护自己自由的权利；另一些民族则服从官员，臣民们会被别人享受他们失去的幸福所激怒，一心只想奴役他们的邻人。总之，一些民族产生了财富和征服，而另一些民族只有幸福和美德。

尽管政府的形式有所不同，但最初，所有官员都是被选举出来的。当一个人的财富不能影响到他人的时候，他的功绩能够让他占有优势，因为功绩给人带来天然的威望；或者由于年龄较长，他的处事经验和审慎决断的能力也是一种优势。希伯来人的“长者”，斯巴达的“长老”，罗马的“元老院”，甚至我们所谓的“领主”一词的来源，都表明老人曾经受到何等尊重。然而，越是老年人频繁当选，选举就越频繁，事情就越是烦琐。于是阴谋开始酝酿了，派别逐渐形成了，党派斗争愈演愈烈，内战也爆发了，个人的生命成了所谓国家幸福的牺牲品。于是最终人们又将回到原初混乱的局面，野心勃勃的官员们，从这种混乱的局面中渔利，将职权永远掌握在他们家族的手中。而人们已经习惯于依附、舒适、安乐的生活，再也没有能力打碎身上的枷锁，为了维护自己的安宁，他们宁愿带上更沉重的枷锁。然后，这些官员就成为世袭的了，掌权者也逐渐习惯于将官位看成自己家族的财产，将自己视为国家的主人，而最初，他们只不过是一些官员。他们将其他公民视为奴隶，像清点牲畜一样将他们算在自己的财产之列，最终自诩为神，甚至是王中之王。

如果我们沿着各种变革来追踪不平等的进展，就会发现，第一阶段的不平等是法律和所有权的设立，第二阶段的不平等是官员制度的设立，而法制权威向专制权威的转变则是第三阶段，也是最后一个阶段的不平等。因此第一阶段认可的不平等是富与穷，第二阶段是强与弱，第三阶段是奴隶和主人，最后一个阶段的不平等是前两个阶段不平等持续发展的最终结果，直到新的变革彻底推翻了政府，或者重新回到法制状态为止。

为理解这种进展的必然性，我们没有必要考虑政府设立的动机，而应考察它实际上采用的组织形式，和随后必然会出现的种种弊端，因为这些弊端使政府的设立和腐败同时成为必然。我们不去考虑斯巴达的情况，因为那里的法律主要关注的是儿童的教育问题(21)，并且莱格古士(22)为他们开创的风气实际上使法律本身成为多余。法律作为一种规定，它自身的约束力弱于欲望，它只能限制人们而无法改变人们。不难证明，任何一个政府如果像它成立之初一样一成不变地走下去，严格防止任何变革或者腐化，那么它本来就没有成立的必要。因为对一个国家来说，如果任何一个人都不触犯法律，任何一个官员都不滥用权力，那么无论法律还是官员都没有存在的必要。

政治上的差别必然导致人与人之间的差别，官员与民众之间不平等的扩大势必导致民众之间不平等的产生，并且，因欲望、才能和环境的不同而千差万别。官员们篡夺非法权力来提拔一群走狗，将一部分权力分给他们。同时，人民在盲目野心的驱动下甘愿受人压迫，他们不是向上看而是向下看，比起独立自主来说，他们更热衷于压迫别人，他们甘做奴隶为的是反过来奴役别人。很难使一个没有野心控制别人的人去服从别人，即使是最精明的政治家也不能使一个追求自由的人屈服。然而，不平等能轻易在懦夫和野心家那里横行，他们时刻等待时机，随时准备冒险，无论是统治别人还是服从别人，对于他们来说几乎没有什么区别。然后，这样一个时代必然降临，那时人们的双眼已被蒙蔽，只要统治者对他们其中最卑微的一个人说：“让你和你的子孙后代都成为贵族吧！”他便立即在众人面前尊贵起来，甚至连他自己也觉得自己很尊贵，并且年代越久远，他的后裔就越发尊贵，他们家族成为贵族的原因越是模糊不清，越是难以确定，它所产生的效果就越强；一个家族中无所事事的人越多，这个家族就越显赫。

如果这里是探究细节的地方，我很乐意解释为什么即使没有政府的干预，人与人之间也会产生声望与权威的不平等。因为一旦结成社会，人们就开始相互比较，从邻居们持续不断的交往中，人们发现了他们之间的种种差异(23)。这些差异有几种主要类型，其中财富、地位或者等级、权力以及个人品质是人们相互评价的主要准则。我可以证明这几个方面之间的和谐或冲突是国家制度好与坏的最可靠的标志。我还可以指出，在这四种不平等中，个人品质之间的不平等是其他所有不平等的基础，而财富上的不平等是最终的不平等。因为财富直接指向人们的幸福，又最容易转移，财富还可以用来购买其他一切。通过以上观察，我们就能够准确判断一个民族距离原始状态的远近以及这个民族在走向衰败极点进程中的位置。借助这一点，我可以解释那些追求声望、荣誉和地位的普遍愿望是如何激起了全体人们的热情，如何锤炼着并使他们不断较量着彼此的才能和力量；我也可以解释它是怎样刺激着我们的欲望，使我们的欲望迅速膨胀，它将无数野心家置于同一竞赛场上，为人们开启了无处不在的竞争、对抗或者说是敌对，造成了不计其数的失败、成功和混乱。

人们有成为众人焦点的欲望，出人头地的强烈冲动。我可以证明正是这些欲望和冲动给了我们大量的恶和少量的善，给了我们最骄傲和最可鄙的东西：美德与恶习，科学与谬误，哲学家和征服者。总之，我可以证明，因为强者只珍视弱者没有的东西，而且失去了弱者悲惨的命运，强者便感觉不到自己固有的幸福，所以只有一小部分富有、强大的人站在命运塔顶的光环中，而大部分人缺衣少食，默默无闻。

然而，光是对上述观点进行详细阐述就足以写出一部巨著了，我们可以通过与自然状态的对比，将各种政府的利弊加以比较。同时，我们还可以揭示由政府的不同性质及其由于时间的发展不可避免产生的变革中，已经产生的不平等或者在未来数世纪中将要产生的不平等的种种表现形式。我们可以看到，人民大众为反抗国外压迫者所做的一切努力，最终压迫了他们自身；我们可以看到统治者的权力在无限地扩张，被压迫者丝毫看不到这种压迫何时才能停止，更不知道他们还有什么合法的途径来反抗这种压迫；我们可以看到公民权利和民族自由在逐渐消失，而弱者的任何抱怨、不满和要求都被视为叛乱的怨言；我们可以看到政治将保卫公众利益的荣誉仅限于人民中的一小部分吃皇粮的官员；我们可以看到，赋税因而出现，悲惨的农民，不堪苛捐杂税的压榨(24)，即便是在和平年代也会抛弃田地，扔掉犁铧，举剑而起；我们还可以看到各种混乱荒唐的荣誉法则也出现了，而国家的保卫者迟早会变成人民的敌人，只会将他们的利剑插入同胞的胸膛；最终，这样一个时代将会降临，人们将会向他们的统治者说：

“你命令我把利剑刺进父亲的胸膛，

刺入怀孕的妻子腹中，

我终会执行你的命令，

尽管我的双手在反抗(25)。”

从财富和地位的极端不平等中，从各种各样的欲望和才能中，从各种无用且有害的技术和无聊的科学中，产生了大量的偏见，这种偏见同时违反了理性、幸福和道德。我们可以看到，掌权者费尽心机破坏民众的联合，在民众之间制造分裂。他们制造所有能引起分裂的争端，却又维持表面上的社会和谐，他们将各阶层人民的利益和权利对立起来，使各阶层的人民相互敌对、彼此猜疑，以加强他们的统治。

正是从这种混乱和动荡中间，暴政逐渐抬起它罪恶的头，吞噬一个国家里所有健康完整的事物，最终践踏着法律和人民，在共和国(26)的废墟上建立它的统治。在暴政建立之前的那个时期，必然是一个充满动荡和灾难的时期。但最终一切都被这个恶魔吞噬，人民不再有首领，也不再有法律，而只剩下暴君。从这时起，再也没有品行和道德可言，在暴政肆虐的地方，谁也别指望从忠贞那儿得到什么，也没有任何其他主人，只要暴君一声令下，正义和职责就黯然失色。盲从是奴隶能够拥有的唯一美德。

这就是不平等的终点，一个圆圈的封闭点，一切又与开始的起点重合。这时，每个个体又回到了最初的平等状态，因为他们同样一无所有。除了君主的意志，臣民没有任何法律；君主除了自己的欲望，没有别的限制。所有善良的观念和一切公正原则又重新消失了。这时，一切都重新回到了强者法则，回到一个新的自然状态中。这个新的自然状态与原初的自然状态不同，原初的自然状态是纯粹的自然状态，而新的自然状态是极度腐化的结果。然而，这两种状态在其他方面的差别都非常小，并且政府契约已经被暴政破坏殆尽，因而，只有在暴君是最强者的时候，他才是国家的主人，一旦他被驱逐，他连抱怨的权利都没有。民众暴动杀死或者推翻君主，就像他前一天处理臣民的生命和财产一样合法(27)。他经由暴力建立的政权，也会被暴力推翻。这样，一切又根据自然秩序行事，因而无论频繁短暂的革命带来何种后果，没有人能抱怨别人的不公正，只能埋怨自己的不幸或过失。

如果细心的读者想发现和追溯人类从自然状态到社会状态所经历的那些被人遗忘的过程，根据我刚才描述的那种中间状态，细心地重现我因时间仓促而不得不舍弃的讨论或者我想象力所未及揭示的那个部分，他一定会惊讶地发现，这两种状态之间的差距是多么巨大！如果读者追寻到这种极其缓慢的过程，他就能解决许多哲学家们不能解决的政治伦理问题。他将会发现在不同的时代，人也是不同的，他就会知道，第欧根尼(28)之所以找不到人的原因，是因为他是在他的时代中寻找较早时代的人。他就会明白，加图和罗马与自由同归于尽(29)，是因为生错了时代，如果他早生五百年，他一定统治了罗马，这个伟大的人肯定会让世界震惊。总之，借助这样的分析，读者就可以解释人的精神和欲望是如何在不知不觉中改变了他们的自然本性，为什么我们的需求和兴趣的对象最终发生了改变，以及为什么在原始人逐渐消失的时候，社会只为我们提供了一个由做作的人和肤浅的欲望组成的集合体，这个集合体是所有新产生的联系的产物，在自然状态中完全没有任何真正的基础。我们对这个问题的思考全部都被观察所证实，原始人和文明人在内心深处和行为倾向上都如此不同，以至于给文明人带来无比快乐的东西，反而会使原始人陷入绝望的深渊。原始人呼吸自由和宁静的空气，他们只愿过闲散的生活，即使是斯葛多派(30)的淡泊也远远比不上他们对身外之物的冷漠。而文明人，整日奔波，劳心劳力，为的只是让自己更加劳苦，一生劳作，至死方休。为了生存往往要冒着死亡的危险，或者为了追求永生而自绝于世。文明人会向他憎恨的权贵和鄙视的富翁大献殷勤，他们一刻不停地追求为这些人服务的荣耀；他们厚颜无耻地夸耀自己的卑贱和别人给他们的庇荫，他们以当奴隶为自豪，同时又以轻蔑的言辞嘲笑那些不能享受这种荣耀的人。一个加勒比人会如何评价欧洲大臣的繁重却令人羡慕的工作？这个悠闲的原始人宁愿经历多次残酷的死亡，也不愿过这样一种生活，即使这种生活中有行善的乐趣也很难让他感到高兴。然而，要让这个原始人了解所有这些热情的来源，他必须首先知道“权力”和“荣誉”这两个词的含义，他还应该知道有一些人重视这个世界上其他人的看法，他们的幸福和满足更多地来源于别人的评价，而不是根据自己的感受。事实上，原始人与文明人之间差别的根源在于，原始人只生活在他们自己的世界中，而文明人一直生活在自己的世界之外，他们仅仅知道按别人的意愿来生活，以至于似乎只有别人对他们的评价才能体现他们自己生存的意义。这里，我并不想追究，何以尽管有许多讨论道德的漂亮文章，人的这种品性还是产生了对善恶观念的冷漠；也不打算致力于探明为何一切事物都简化为表象，甚至在荣誉、友谊、美德以及罪恶本身都只剩下矫揉造作的时候，而从这种造作中，我们终于学会了吹嘘的秘诀。总之，我也不打算追问，为什么我们总是问别人自己是什么，而从来不敢拿这个问题来问自己。在众多的哲学道理、人性、文明和高尚的道德箴言中，我们什么也没有，我们剩下的就只是轻浮而虚假的表象，拥有荣誉却没有道德，会思考却没有智慧，耽于享受却没有幸福。我不想去探究那些问题，我只需证明，这些绝不是人类的自然本性，社会的精神以及社会产生的不平等改变和破坏了我们所有的自然品性。

我已经追溯了不平等的起源和发展，以及政治社会的建立过程和必然会产生的种种弊端，这些是我尽量仅依靠推理从人类的本性中推演出来的，丝毫不受神圣教义的影响，这些教义从一开始就赋予君主以神圣的权威(31)。由本文的说明可知，自然状态中几乎没有任何不平等，所有现在盛行的不平等来源于人类能力的发展和思想的进步，并随着这二者的发展而逐渐加深，最终在私有制和法律建立之后，确立为永恒的合法现象。此外，仅为实在法所确立的精神不平等，当和生理不平等相抵触的时候，它就与自然法则相冲突。这两种不平等之间的区别足以使我们决定对待所有文明国家之中的那种不平等应该持有什么样的看法。无论人们怎样定义不平等，孩子指挥老人，傻子命令智者，少数权贵挥霍无度，而大众却因缺少基本生活必需品而忍饥挨饿，显然都是违反自然法则的。

(23) 即使文明社会中能够实行公平分配，这也与自然状态中严格的平等相对立。因为国家的每个成员都按照自己的才智和能力为国家服务，所以应该根据每个人做出的实际贡献进行奖励和提拔。我们应该从这个意义上来理解伊索克拉特的文章，他赞美古雅典的人们已经区分出了两种平等中哪一种更为有用，即：一种是不加区别地对所有公民进行利益分配，另一种是根据每个人的贡献来分配利益。这个作者继续说道：英明的政治家摒弃了不区分好人坏人的那种没有道理的不平等，转而坚决拥护论功行赏的不平等。

然而，首先，根本不存在不分善恶的社会，无论这个社会腐化到何种程度。关于道德，法律不能为之提供精确的法则作为法官的执行准则，为了防止法官随意判决一个人的命运和品行，法律应该相当谨慎地禁止法官个人判断一个人的品行，而只能判断一个人的行为。只有古罗马的民风才能禁得住监察官的监督，而这样的裁判所只会给我们的世界造成混乱。人们品行的善恶交由公众评判，而法官的权力只能严格限于判决权力。公众才是道德的真正裁判，在这一点上也是最正直、最有洞察力的裁判，他们可能暂时被欺骗，却不能被腐蚀。所以，公民的等级不应以他们的个人品行来评定（这将使法官有权任意滥用法律），而应根据每个人对国家的贡献大小来评定，只有这样才能做出更正确的评价。（英译者注）

(26) 《社会契约论》第二卷第七章：“一切合法的政府都是共和制的。”（48页）关于共和制，卢梭在注释中指出：“我理解这一名词不仅是指一种贵族制度或者一种民主制，而是一般地指一切被公意，也就是被法律所指导的政府。政府要称其为合法，就绝不能与主权者混为一谈，而只能是主权的执行者；这样，君主制本身也还是共和制。”（48页注释）卢梭之所以用“共和国”这一词语，其含义就是指这种一般性的、以法律为指导的政府，而不是指特定的政府组织形式。

附录


一位著名的作者在思考人类生活的好处与坏处，并在比较了两者的总量之后，发现我们的痛苦远远超过了我们的幸福。所以，总的来说，人的生命根本就不是造物主给人类的一件有价值的礼物。这个结论并不使我感到惊讶，因为作者是从对文明人的研究中得出这个结论的，如果他追溯到自然状态，他的研究将明显是另一种结果，他就会发现人类所遭受的痛苦几乎都是由人类本身造成的。而人类将自己弄到如此痛苦的地步也是经历了巨大的苦难的。一方面，如果我们考虑到人类付出了多么巨大的努力，使多少种科学日臻完善，发明了多少技术，运用了多少力量，填平了多少深渊，铲平了多少高山，凿碎了多少岩石，疏通了多少河道，开垦了多少荒野，挖出了多少湖泊，抽干了多少沼泽，在大地上建立了多少雄伟建筑，在海上航行着多少船只；然而，另一方面，只要我们稍稍思考一下，这所有的一切努力对于人类幸福而言究竟有什么真正的好处，我们就不禁惊讶于这两者之间是多么不相称！我们便会为人们的痴迷感到惋惜。人们为了满足自己愚蠢的骄傲和无聊的自我欣赏，便热切地追求所有能体会到的痛苦，尽管仁慈的大自然本想使人类避开这些痛苦的。

人类已经堕落了，持续不断的悲惨经验已经证实了这一点。然而，我相信我已经指明了，人的本性是善良的，如果不是人类体质发生的变化，人类取得的进步和获得的知识，人怎么会堕落到如此地步？我们尽可以尽情赞美人类，然而，无论如何，事实上人们的利益碰撞得越厉害，人们就越彼此仇恨；人们表面上相互帮助，实际上却想尽一切办法彼此残害。如果人们之间的关系是这样一种关系，每个人出于自己的利益为自己指定的行为准则与公共理性为全体利益而指定的规则完全相反，每个人都指望着邻居的垮台以渔利，那么人们会做何感想呢？恐怕没有一个生活富足的有钱人不被他贪婪的继承人暗中希望早点死去的(1)——甚至连他自己的儿女也是如此；没有一个海上船只的事故不被另一些商人视为喜讯的；没有一个恶毒的债务人不希望他债权人的房子被火烧掉，所有票据都化为灰烬的；没有一个国家不庆幸邻国遭受灾难的。正是从同类的不幸中，我们获取利益，也正是一个人的损失，往往会导致另一个人财富的增加。然而，更可怕的是，无数的个人都期待着公共灾难的发生，一些人希望发生瘟疫，一些人希望人们大量死亡，一些人希望发生战争，还有一些人希望发生饥荒。我曾经见过一些邪恶的人竟然为丰收的景象而伤心落泪。发生在伦敦的大火灾(2)夺去了许多人的生命和财产，但后来竟成为上万人发财的机会。我知道蒙田(3)曾经指责过一个雅典人戴玛德，他惩罚了一个高价出售棺材的工匠，这个工匠从同胞们的死亡中发了大财。蒙田的主张是，不应该只惩罚那个工匠，而应该惩罚所有的人。这个理由恰好证实了我的观点。由此，让我们透过虚假的表象来剖析人们内心最深处的想法，让我们思考一下，这个世界是一种什么状态：人们不得不相互关爱却又彼此伤害；由于职责，他们生来就是敌人，而由于利益，他们又相互欺骗。或许，会有人对我说，社会本来就是这样，每个人都为他人服务，自己也能从中得到好处。如果真是这样，当然很好，只要人们不通过伤害别人去获得更多利益。然而，没有哪种通过合法的手段获得的利益比得上通过非法手段获得的利益。通过损害别人总是比通过为别人服务收获更多。这样做，唯一需要考虑的是如何避免惩罚，为了达到这个目的，强者就用尽所有的力量，而弱者就用尽所有的伎俩。

对于原始人来说，他们饱腹之后，就与世无争，对自然没有任何要求，与同类和平相处。即使偶尔为食物与同类发生争执，他们也会首先掂量一下，与人争夺食物和到别处寻找食物哪个更简单，然后才会跟别人抢夺。由于原始人没有尊严的概念，所以他们之间的争斗也仅限于打几下，打赢的就吃掉食物，打输的就到别处寻找食物，然后，一切又都恢复平静。然而，社会状态中的人则全然不同，他们的欲望是难以满足的。他们最初只需要基本的生活用品，然后又追求一些剩余，之后还要追求享受、无穷的财富、臣民和奴隶，丝毫不愿享受片刻安宁。并且更令人费解的是，越是不自然的、不迫切的需要，越是能激发他们的欲望。更糟的是，他们奢求的越多，就越有能力满足这些奢求，以至于在长期的奢靡生活之后，在吞噬了无数的财富之后，在残害了无数同类之后，这些英雄最终还是要杀掉一切人，直到他们最终成为世界的唯一主人为止。这就是人类道德的缩影，即使不是人类生活的缩影，至少也是文明人内心隐秘欲望的缩影。

如果我们公正地比较一下文明人和原始人的状态，如果可能的话，去找出前者除去所有的罪恶、欲望和不幸之外，还向死亡和痛苦敞开了多少大门。如果你们想象一下，折磨我们精神的各种痛苦，耗尽我们精力的强烈欲望，穷人遭受的过度劳累，富人沉溺于其中的更加有害的安逸生活，穷人往往因为缺乏一些东西而死去，富人却因为过度享用这些东西而死去；如果你们稍稍注意各种各样的奇异混合食品，有害健康的调味品，滥用食物的腐败样子，假药，卖假药商人使用的花招，医生开假药给病人的罪恶，以及配制药品所使用的有毒器皿；如果你们留意到，由于人们大量聚集，导致空气污染，从而引起各种传染病，或者由于我们过度奢靡的生活方式，由于室内外温度的差别，由于增减衣物不够及时，以及由于所有感官享受已经变成必要的习惯，一旦有所忽视就会导致身体的不适或者危及生命；如果你还将那些毁灭过多少城市、夺去多少生命的大火和地震计算在内，总之，如果你将所有威胁人类生存的危险都加在一起，你就会明白，因为我们轻视自然的告诫，自然让我们付出了多么惨痛的代价！

这里我并不想再重复我在别处已经讲过的战争的灾难，但我希望有识之士能够愿意并敢于向公众揭露军粮和医院的承包商在军队中的各种贪腐丑闻的详细内幕。我们将会清楚地看到，他们的丑恶罪行——这几乎已经不再是秘密——足以在瞬间摧毁一支精良的部队，它所造成的士兵伤亡远比在战场上的伤亡更严重。

在海上航行中，每年有多少人因饥饿、坏血病、海盗、火灾或者船只失事失去了生命，航行造成的死亡数量令人震惊。所有这些谋杀、投毒、抢劫甚至对罪犯的惩罚也都应该归咎于私有制的建立，因而也就应归咎于社会的建立。尽管这些惩罚是为了防止更大的危害，但因为杀害一个人就夺去两个或者两个以上的人的生命，这对人类来说是双重的损失！

人们使用了多少种可耻的手段来阻止孩子的出生：或者通过残忍堕落的各种怪癖，来侮辱自然最杰出的作品，原始人和动物是绝不会有这些怪癖的，这些怪癖只能从文明人的肮脏想象力中产生；或者通过秘密堕胎，这是淫乱和顾全名誉的必然做法；或者通过抛弃和杀掉大量婴儿，这些婴儿都是父母的贫困或母亲残忍的羞耻心的受害者(4)；或者阉割一些不幸者，他们的半条性命和对子孙后代的希望都成了苍白赞美诗的祭品，或者更残酷的是，做了某些人残忍嫉妒心的祭品。对于最后一种情况，这种阉割无论是从受害者所承受的痛苦，还是从使用的目的来看，都是对自然的双重侮辱。然而，那种千百次发生在我们眼前的父权公开违背人性的事情不是更常见更可怕吗(5)？就因为父亲无理的压制使得多少天才被埋没，多少自由被限制！有多少人本可以在一个适宜的环境中大展宏图，然而却在另一种他毫无兴趣的环境中郁郁终生！在那种永远违背自然的混乱秩序中，有多少美满的婚姻因双方地位的悬殊而被拆散！有多少纯洁的妻子遭受了侮辱！有多少对纯洁善良的夫妻因错配了姻缘彼此都痛苦不堪！有多少年轻人成为贪婪父母的不幸受害者，深深陷入罪恶之中不能自拔，或者在眼泪中艰难度日，默默忍受那种财富促成的、他们内心不情愿却又无法摆脱的痛苦婚姻！如果有人没有被野蛮的强力驱使到罪恶和绝望中，而以自身的勇气和美德使自己脱离这种生活，那他们是多么幸运！请宽恕我吧，我的父亲母亲，我很抱歉我的抱怨加重了你们的痛苦，然而我希望你们的痛苦可以作为一个永恒的痛苦榜样，以警告后来者胆敢以自然的名义来触犯她最神圣的权利！

以上我仅仅谈起由我们的制度所引起的那些不幸的结合，然而，难道我们可以因此认为由爱情和同情心维系的结合就没有任何弊端吗？如果我指出，人性在其根源中，甚至在最神圣的关系中就已经受到了伤害，我们又该做何感想呢？因为即便是在这神圣的关系中，财富也是首要考虑的事情，社会的无序混淆了是非黑白，禁欲变成了罪行，而拒绝生育成了人道之举。然而，我还是不要揭开这些可怕事实所戴的面纱吧，我们只需指出这些罪恶，期待人们来做出弥补吧。

所有这些苦难之外还有大量有害健康的工作，减少人们的寿命，损害人们的身体，例如矿山的工作，金属和矿物的制备工作，尤其是铅、铜、汞、钴、砷等，还有其他危险的工作，每天都夺去许多瓦工、木匠、石匠、矿工的生命。所有这些加起来，我们就会明白在社会的建立和不断完善的过程中人口数量不断减少的原因，这一点许多哲学家都曾指出过。

在追求个人安乐和别人尊敬的人们中，奢侈不可避免地产生了，不久之后就将伴随社会引来的灾难发展到极点。富人们从来没有给过穷人一块面包，却借口养活穷人，剥夺了穷人的财富，迟早会使人口大量减少。奢侈作为医治手段，恐怕会产生比它所要治疗的疾病还要可怕的灾难，或者说奢侈本身就是其中最大的灾难(6)。因为要维持奢侈所需要的奴仆和穷人，所有的公民和劳动者都受到了压迫和毁灭。奢侈就像炎热的季风，给树木植物带来了铺天盖地的蝗虫，将有益动物的食物吃个精光，饥荒和死亡就随着热风到处蔓延。

社会和奢侈的生活，带来了人文科学、机械技术、商业、文字以及所有使工业繁荣和国家兴衰的无用事物。人类堕落的原因不难认清，从农业的性质来说，它是所有技术中获利最少的一个，因为农业只生产最基本的生存用品，它的价格必然只适合于最贫穷的人的购买能力。

同样的道理，我们可以据此推论：一般情况下，技术获利的多寡和它的用处大小成反比。因而，最有用的技术反而最不被人重视，由此我们可以知道，该如何看待工业真正的价值和工业进步产生的实际影响。

这就是最终会给一个繁荣的国家带来的所有不幸的明显原因，工业和技术不断兴盛，要维持富人奢靡的生活，卑贱的农夫势必要背负更沉重的赋税，注定要在饥饿和贫穷中度过一生。于是他们离开故土，到城里谋生，而那里本应该是由他们供养的地方。繁华都市越是吸引乡下人的羡慕，我们便越哀叹被他们抛弃的乡村，荒芜的大片田地。充斥整个城市的人们沦为乞丐和强盗，注定要在肮脏的角落或是在绞架上结束他们悲惨的一生(7)。就这样，国家在富庶起来的同时也衰弱下去，人口急剧减少。即使是最强大的君主在努力增强国力然后又减少人口之后，还是不免要被穷国吞并(8)。然而，当穷国征服了富国之后，也继续经历富裕和人口减少，再转而被另一些穷国毁灭。

有谁能告诉我们，曾蹂躏过欧洲、亚洲和非洲数世纪之久的蛮族是如何产生的？他们庞大的人口是由于工业和艺术的发展、智慧的法律，还是他们杰出的政治体系呢？希望有识之士来告诉我们，为什么这些彪悍的民族没有知识、没有科学、没有教育、没有规约，却没有因争夺财物而互相残杀损失殆尽，反而繁衍生息到如此程度呢？请告诉我们，这些无知的蛮族为何如此傲慢以至于敢对抗我们这样智慧、拥有训练有素的军队、拥有如此卓越的法律和制度的民族呢？为什么自从北方几个国家开始建立社会并不断发展之后，当地居民如此努力地学习社会责任和和平相处的艺术之后，我们反而再也看不到他们像以前一样繁衍大量的人口呢？恐怕最后终于有人这样回答我：所有伟大的事物，都是由人的智慧创造出来的，他们就像一种有益的瘟疫，防止人口过度繁衍，以防止地球上的居民终有一天会嫌我们的世界太过拥挤。

然而，我们又该怎么办呢？难道我们必须彻底毁灭社会，抛弃“你的”、“我的”这种区分，重新回到森林和熊生活在一起？这是我的论敌能推论出来的结论。我将预先展示他们的想法，让他们因为得出这样的结论而羞惭(9)。你们啊，你们从来没有倾听上帝的声音，你们总以为人类注定要在短暂的生命中平静地生活然后死去。你们尽可以抛弃在城市中的一切不幸收获，抛弃不得安宁的精神，抛弃你们堕落的灵魂和无尽的欲望。既然你们完全自由，你们尽可以返回到纯真的远古时代，重返森林，忘却你的同类所犯下的一切罪恶，而且也不必因为抛弃了罪恶的同时抛弃了一切进步而感到有辱于你们的种族。然而，对于我这样的人，欲望铲除了原始的纯真，嘴巴舍弃了植物和橡果，品行不得不依靠法律和法官，但我们从祖先那里就已经获得了超自然赐予的荣誉，觉得从一开始上帝就赋予人类行为一种难能可贵的道德感，所以我们必须遵从这种道德感行事，这必然是上帝的意旨，任何其他体系都不能包含，更无法解释。总之，我们被教导说上帝召唤所有人向往天使的幸福和智慧，我们致力于将我们的美德付诸实践，以求不辜负上帝赋予我们的永恒的恩赐。他们会尊重他们社会中相互的神圣关系，他们热爱自己的同胞，尽力为他们服务，他们严格遵守法律，服从他们的立法者和执法者，他们尤其尊敬那些明智善良的国王，而这国王尽心尽力，防止、治疗或减轻那些一直困扰着他们的苦难和不幸。他们无须逢迎也无须惧怕他们的官员，他们通过赞美他们的官职的重要意义和职责的神圣性来激励他们工作的热情。然而，对于那些只能依赖于杰出的人物协助才能发挥作用，而且无论他们如何努力，仍然只能产生比表面上的好处更多的实际的灾难的宪法，他们仍然会不吝轻视之情。

(4) 卢梭虽然痛骂堕胎者和弃婴杀婴者，他自己却也是其中之一。他一再抛弃自己的孩子，他自己的辩解是因为贫穷和为戴莱丝·瓦瑟的声誉着想。在《忏悔录》中，卢梭强调社会的淫乱风气导致堕胎和抛弃婴儿成为很普遍的现象，然而，从这里可以看出，弃婴是一种违背自然和理性的行为。

(5) 卢梭在这里强烈指责父母包办婚姻导致很多男女在不幸的婚姻中郁郁寡欢。卢梭后来爱上的乌德托夫人在十八岁就被迫嫁给了乌德托伯爵。

(6) 针对当时流行的一种言论的有力反驳，这种言论认为富人养活穷人，奢侈是医治贫穷的手段。

(7) 卢梭对乡村生活充满热爱，对农民大量涌入城市充满担忧。他在《社会契约论》第四卷第四章中提到，罗马赫赫有名的人物都生活在农村，并耕种土地，“人们宁愿过乡村的简朴勤劳的生活，而不愿过罗马市民游手好闲的生活。”（144页）他认为，生活在城市的都是不幸的无产者、游手好闲之人。所以，对于农民抛弃土地，沦落到城里，他感到十分痛惜。

(8) 卢梭将人口的繁荣当作判定一个政府好坏的标志：“设立政府的目的是为了什么？就是为了它的成员的生存和繁荣。而他们生存和繁荣的最确切、可靠的标志又是什么呢？那就是他们的数目和他们的人口了。……假定一切情况都相等，那么一个不靠外来移民、不靠归化、不靠殖民地的政府，而在它的治下公民人数繁殖和增长得最多，它就确定无疑的是最好的政府。那个在它的治下人民减少而凋零的政府就是最坏的政府。”（107页）《社会契约论》第三卷第九章。

(9) 卢梭虽然抨击当时社会病入膏肓，讲述原始人种种的淳朴自由，却并不主张回到原始状态，而是致力于改变现有的社会状态，实现自己的理想国。1755年，伏尔泰在给卢梭的信中写道：“从没有人用过这么大的智慧企图把我们变成动物，读了你的书，真的想用四只脚走路了。”这正是卢梭说的他的论敌可能推论出来的结论。





论文写作的背景


只能在自然的秩序中考察自然，而不能在变质的事物中考察自然。

——亚里士多德，《政治学》，第一卷第二章

1749年，37岁的卢梭在前去范塞纳堡探望狄德罗（狄德罗因为《论盲人的信札》遭囚禁）的路上，看到第戎学院的征文题目：“科学和艺术的进步对改良风尚是否有益？”他应征而写的《论科学与艺术》获得了第戎学院的奖金，并使他名声大噪。在此之前，他不过是一个籍籍无名的小人物。三年之后，他写的歌剧《乡村卜师》正式上演，轰动巴黎，并受到法国国王和王后的赞赏。然而，卢梭拒绝接受国王赐予的年金，成为备受争议的人物，上流社会的王公贵族争相和他结交，而论敌们也不断地和他进行笔战。

1753年，卢梭再次看到第戎学院的征文题目：“人类不平等的根源是什么？自然法则是否认可这种不平等？”本文即为卢梭看到这次征文题目之后而写的文章。卢梭为了构思这篇论文，特地到圣日耳曼的森林里，冥想七八天。关于原始人在森林中自由闲散的生活和文明人的各种痛苦的对比，就是在那里冥想的结果。这一次，论文没有获奖，但是卢梭反而认为，《论科学与艺术》并不是一篇好文章，反而是《论人类不平等的起源和基础》是他比较满意的文章，因为它不是为了获奖而写的，而是表达了自己的真实观点。他在《忏悔录》中写道：“它是为了应征而写的，我就把它寄出去了，但是心里预先就已经料定它不会得奖，因为我深知学院之设置奖金绝不是为了征求这种货色的。”但是这篇论文却是卢梭阐发政治思想的开始，并为《社会契约论》的写作准备了基础，文中很多观点在《社会契约论》中都有发展。

卢梭年表


关于卢梭的一生，除了卢梭在自己的《忏悔录》中做了深刻的剖析之外，两百多年间，也已经有太多的小传、年表之类的作品不断建构着卢梭的生命故事。我们读到的卢梭已经远远不是两百多年前的那个苦难而浪漫的卢梭了，每个译者、每个读者、每个作者心中都有自己独特的卢梭形象。有人为卢梭作传，出于某些目的，隐瞒了一些事实，美化了一些事实，抛开了卢梭生命中不光彩的一面，只展现他作为伟大的思想启蒙者光辉的一面；或者，有些人，完全抛开了他的生命故事，仅仅追溯他思想的足迹，追寻各种论著的成书过程，或者把他与那个宏大的时代联系在一起，甚至把他和后来发生的一系列社会和思想的变革联系在一起；当然，还有人，不管是他同时代的人，还是众多的后来者，对他的生活，对他的性格进行猛烈的抨击。这些固然都是有益的，也是必要的，然而，我想，既然卢梭敢于站在世人面前赤裸裸地展现自己的一切善恶，敢于对着后来人挑剔的目光为自己辩护，我们也就没有必要美化他的生活，更没有必要拿我们的道德标准来评价他。无论怎样的人生，都难以逃过世人的检视，无论多么伟大的人，都不会没有不可见人的过去。一群犹太人嚷嚷着要扔石头打死一个通奸的女人，但是耶稣说，你们中间有谁没有犯过罪，就可以拿石头打死她，结果，没有人有资格扔石头。因此，对于卢梭，我们完完全全可以把他的生活摆出来，剖析他的生活，理解他的思想，因为，他写《忏悔录》的时候就已经把自己摆在手术台上了。一切或丑或美的故事，都是他为自己辩护的证据。考虑到这些，译者特意为卢梭列了一个年表，既包括了他生命中重要的故事，也包括重要作品的形成。更重要的是，译者想展现卢梭作为一个活生生的人所经历的成长变化过程，他的思想性格以及时代背景，以便更好地展现卢梭个人思想的独特之处。

1751年39岁

第三个孩子出世，同样被送往育婴堂。（卢梭共将五个孩子送往育婴堂。）




1752年40岁

歌剧《乡村卜师》成功上演，受到国王和王后的青睐，路易十五打算接见卢梭，并赐给他一项年金，然而卢梭顾虑会因为接受年金而失去自由，就刻意回避，遭到普遍的谴责。《乡村卜师》后来曾多次上演，但卢梭从中获益很少。




1753年41岁

到圣日耳曼短期旅行，为应征第戎学院征文而写《论人类不平等的起源和基础》。在这篇论文中，卢梭认为，人类的不平等起源于私有制的建立和社会的形成。他设想一个自然状态，人与人之间没有任何联系，但是每个人都是自由而平等的，人们淳朴寡欲，和平相处。但是社会建立之后，人们有了私有财产之后，就产生了欲望、争斗、虚荣，继而一部分人沦为奴隶，而另一部分人成为统治者。为了维持少数人的奢侈生活就奴役人类的大部分，这种制度是极其不合理的，也是违反自然法则的。卢梭的这一观点，对当时贵族的奢靡风气是一种无情的批判，当然不符合第戎学院征文的意图，因而不能获奖。

因《关于法国音乐的信》被取消歌剧院免费入场权。




1754年42岁

与果佛古尔、瓦瑟去日内瓦，发现果佛古尔的恶行。受到日内瓦各界人士的热烈欢迎，恢复日内瓦公民权，重皈新教。

起草《政治制度论》。后选取其中一部分出版为《社会契约论》。《社会契约论》是卢梭阐发政治思想的经典之作，他所论述的是他自己的政治理想，他认为一个合理的政治状态就是人与人之间结成社会契约，在这个契约中，每个人都放弃自己的天然的自由，来实现契约的自由；全体人民的意志集合成一个公意，主权者就代表这个公意进行立法，然后人民选出执政官来按照法律管理社会。他认为一切权力属于人民，人民有权力选举执政官，参与一切公共事务，一切政府的行为都要为了人民的利益而进行。

因厌恶频繁的社交生活，经常到树林里散步。

1755年，葡萄牙里斯本大地震，三万人死亡。孟德斯鸠去世。




1756年44岁

与瓦瑟迁往退隐庐，退隐庐是埃皮奈夫人的房产，卢梭在退隐庐期间受到埃皮奈夫人的资助。卢梭在退隐庐生活将近两年，尽管无法完全避免交际，他还是很享受这种孤独宁静的乡村生活的。

1756至1763年发生“七年战争”，是由欧洲主要国家组成的两大集团的战争，一方为普鲁士、英国，另一方为法国、奥地利、萨克森、瑞典、俄国等国，为争夺殖民地和海域在欧洲、非洲和印度等地发生大规模战争，以英国和普鲁士的胜利告终。




1757年45岁

因与乌德托夫人恋爱一事，和狄德罗、格里姆、埃皮奈夫人闹翻。

写《新爱洛伊丝》，沉浸在对故事情节的幻想之中。这部书信体小说表达了卢梭对爱情的理想，作品中的朱丽是卢梭理想的爱情对象，卢梭通过家庭教师圣·普乐和贵族小姐朱丽的不幸爱情故事，批判了封建婚姻的荒谬和违反人性，热情歌颂了自然感情的伟大。

准备写《爱弥儿》。

年底搬出退隐庐，迁至蒙莫朗西。卢梭在蒙莫朗西一直受到卢森堡夫妇的资助和庇护，直到《爱弥儿》一书出版为止。《爱弥儿》是一部伟大的教育著作，也是给卢梭带来深重灾难的一部著作。卢梭没有教育过自己的任何一个子女，却通过想象写出一部教育名著，以极大的热情来培养爱弥儿。为了改变人与人之间的奴役和不平等现象，卢梭主张从教育儿童开始，培养自然发展的健康的下一代。他提出自然教育，让人服从自然的法则，使人的身心自由发展，通过生活和实践，在具体的环境中让儿童体验生活，获得必要的知识。自然教育的目的就是培养儿童的劳动技能，使儿童获得自由、平等、博爱的思想。




1761年49岁

《新爱洛伊丝》出版，受到女性读者的热捧。

卢森堡元帅去世。




1762年50岁

因出版《爱弥儿》，法国法院对卢梭发出逮捕令，查禁他的书。在《爱弥儿》出版之前的一段时间内，卢梭渐渐感到气氛不对，但他认为自己是正直无辜的，因而并不慌张。

《社会契约论》、《爱弥儿》出版。

巴黎大主教毕蒙对《爱弥儿》发出禁令，接着，巴黎高等法院也发出禁令，并下令追捕卢梭。之后长达八年的时间，卢梭一直在逃难。在各种迫害、谴责甚至是密探的监视下生活，卢梭变得敏感多疑，以致后来不断怀疑身边的人要谋害他。

卢梭只身从巴黎逃至日内瓦，日内瓦当局焚烧《爱弥儿》和《社会契约论》，并下令追捕作者。

逃至伯尔尼，又受到驱逐。

华伦夫人去世。




1763年51岁

逃至普鲁士辖内纳沙泰尔，和瓦瑟居住于莫蒂埃。结识乔治·吉斯元帅。

科西嘉解放运动领袖德·布达福柯邀请卢梭为科西嘉起草宪法。




1765年53岁

《科西嘉宪法草案》出版。

谢绝普鲁士国王的年金。

迁居伯尔尼的圣皮埃尔岛，瓦瑟搬来和他同住。在享受几个月宁静的隐居生活之后，卢梭再次遭到驱逐。

卢梭的《山中书简》和伏尔泰的《哲学辞典》在巴黎一起被焚烧。

潜回巴黎。




1766年54岁

在大卫·休谟（1711—1776年）的带领下，与瓦瑟前往英国休谟家避难，后与大卫·休谟发生冲突。后前往英国武通。

编写《植物学术语词典》。

写作《忏悔录》第一卷。卢梭写作《忏悔录》的目的，与其说是要忏悔，不如说是辩护。在逃难的四年中，卢梭经历种种迫害、诬蔑和攻击，他感觉有必要展示自己的所作所为，为他所受的不公正的待遇做些澄清。《忏悔录》是在卢梭颠沛流离的生活中逐渐写成的，他力求展示自己真实的生活状况，不避讳自己的恶，更不避讳自己的善，他勇敢披露自己的一切，让人们自己去评判是非。




1767年55岁

英国友人帮他领取英王乔治三世赐给他的年金。

DISCOURSE ON INEQUALITY

Jean-Jacques Rousseau





Dedication to the Republic of Geneva


MOST HONOURABLE, MAGNIFICENT AND SOVEREIGN LORDS, convinced that only a virtuous citizen can confer on his country honours which it can accept, I have been for thirty years past working to make myself worthy to offer you some public homage; and, this fortunate opportunity supplementing in some degree the insufficiency of my efforts, I have thought myself entitled to follow in embracing it the dictates of the zeal which inspires me, rather than the right which should have been my authorisation. Having had the happiness to be born among you, how could I reflect on the equality which nature has ordained between men, and the inequality which they have introduced, without reflecting on the profound wisdom by which both are in this State happily combined and made to coincide, in the manner that is most in conformity with natural law, and most favourable to society, to the maintenance of public order and to the happiness of individuals? In my researches after the best rules common sense can lay down for the constitution of a government, I have been so struck at finding them all in actuality in your own, that even had I not been born within your walls I should have thought it indispensable for me to offer this picture of human society to that people, which of all others seems to be possessed of its greatest advantages, and to have best guarded against its abuses.

If I had had to make choice of the place of my birth, I should have preferred a society which had an extent proportionate to the limits of the human faculties; that is, to the possibility of being well governed: in which every person being equal to his occupation, no one should be obliged to commit to others the functions with which he was entrusted: a State, in which all the individuals being well known to one another, neither the secret machinations of vice, nor the modesty of virtue should be able to escape the notice and judgment of the public; and in which the pleasant custom of seeing and knowing one another should make the love of country rather a love of the citizens than of its soil.

I should have wished to be born in a country in which the interest of the Sovereign and that of the people must be single and identical; to the end that all the movements of the machine might tend always to the general happiness. And as this could not be the case, unless the Sovereign and the people were one and the same person, it follows that I should have wished to be born under a democratic government, wisely tempered.

I should have wished to live and die free: that is, so far subject to the laws that neither I, nor anybody else, should be able to cast off their honourable yoke: the easy and salutary yoke which the haughtiest necks bear with the greater docility, as they are made to bear no other.

I should have wished then that no one within the State should be able to say he was above the law; and that no one without should be able to dictate so that the State should be obliged to recognise his authority. For, be the constitution of a government what it may, if there be within its jurisdiction a single man who is not subject to the law, all the rest are necessarily at his discretion. And if there be a national ruler within, and a foreign ruler without, however they may divide their authority, it is impossible that both should be duly obeyed, or that the State should be well governed.

I should not have chosen to live in a republic of recent institution, however excellent its laws; for fear the government, being perhaps otherwise framed than the circumstances of the moment might require, might disagree with the new citizens, or they with it, and the State run the risk of overthrow and destruction almost as soon as it came into being. For it is with liberty as it is with those solid and succulent foods, or with those generous wines which are well adapted to nourish and fortify robust constitutions that are used to them, but ruin and intoxicate weak and delicate constitutions to which they are not suited. Peoples once accustomed to masters are not in a condition to do without them. If they attempt to shake off the yoke, they still more estrange themselves from freedom, as, by mistaking for it an unbridled license to which it is diametrically opposed, they nearly always manage, by their revolutions, to hand themselves over to seducers, who only make their chains heavier than before. The Roman people itself, a model for all free peoples, was wholly incapable of governing itself when it escaped from the oppression of the Tarquins. Debased by slavery, and the ignominious tasks which had been imposed upon it, it was at first no better than a stupid mob, which it was necessary to control and govern with the greatest wisdom; in order that, being accustomed by degrees to breathe the health-giving air of liberty, minds which had been enervated or rather brutalised under tyranny, might gradually acquire that severity of morals and spirit of fortitude which made it at length the people of all most worthy of respect. I should, then, have sought out for my country some peaceful and happy Republic, of an antiquity that lost itself, as it were, in the night of time: which had experienced only such shocks as served to manifest and strengthen the courage and patriotism of its subjects; and whose citizens, long accustomed to a wise independence, were not only free, but worthy to be so.

I should have wished to choose myself a country, diverted, by a fortunate impotence, from the brutal love of conquest, and secured, by a still more fortunate situation, from the fear of becoming itself the conquest of other States: a free city situated between several nations, none of which should have any interest in attacking it, while each had an interest in preventing it from being attacked by the others; in short, a Republic which should have nothing to tempt the ambition of its neighbours, but might reasonably depend on their assistance in case of need. It follows that a republican State so happily situated could have nothing to fear but from itself; and that, if its members trained themselves to the use of arms, it would be rather to keep alive that military ardour and courageous spirit which are so proper among freemen, and tend to keep up their taste for liberty, than from the necessity of providing for their defence.

I should have sought a country, in which the right of legislation was vested in all the citizens; for who can judge better than they of the conditions under which they had best dwell together in the same society? Not that I should have approved of Plebiscita, like those among the Romans; in which the rulers in the State, and those most interested in its preservation, were excluded from the deliberations on which in many cases its security depended; and in which, by the most absurd inconsistency, the magistrates were deprived of rights which the meanest citizens enjoyed.

On the contrary, I should have desired that, in order to prevent self-interested and ill-conceived projects, and all such dangerous innovations as finally ruined the Athenians, each man should not be at liberty to propose new laws at pleasure; but that this right should belong exclusively to the magistrates; and that even they should use it with so much caution, the people, on its side, be so reserved in giving its consent to such laws, and the promulgation of them be attended with so much solemnity, that before the constitution could be upset by them, there might be time enough for all to be convinced, that it is above all the great antiquity of the laws which makes them sacred and venerable, that men soon learn to despise laws which they see daily altered, and that States, by accustoming themselves to neglect their ancient customs under the pretext of improvement, often introduce greater evils than those they endeavour to remove.

I should have particularly avoided, as necessarily ill-governed, a Republic in which the people, imagining themselves in a position to do without magistrates, or at least to leave them with only a precarious authority, should imprudently have kept for themselves the administration of civil affairs and the execution of their own laws. Such must have been the rude constitution of primitive governments, directly emerging from a state of nature; and this was another of the vices that contributed to the downfall of the Republic of Athens.

But I should have chosen a community in which the individuals, content with sanctioning their laws, and deciding the most important public affairs in general assembly and on the motion of the rulers, had established honoured tribunals, carefully distinguished the several departments, and elected year by year some of the most capable and upright of their fellow-citizens to administer justice and govern the State; a community, in short, in which the virtue of the magistrates thus bearing witness to the wisdom of the people, each class reciprocally did the other honour. If in such a case any fatal misunderstandings arose to disturb the public peace, even these intervals of blindness and error would bear the marks of moderation, mutual esteem, and a common respect for the laws; which are sure signs and pledges of a reconciliation as lasting as sincere. Such are the advantages, most honourable, magnificent and sovereign lords, which I should have sought in the country in which I should have chosen to be born. And if Providence had added to all these a delightful situation, a temperate climate, a fertile soil, and the most beautiful countryside under Heaven, I should have desired only, to complete my felicity, the peaceful enjoyment of all these blessings, in the bosom of this happy country; to live at peace in the sweet society of my fellow-citizens, and practising towards them, from their own example, the duties of friendship, humanity, and every other virtue, to leave behind me the honourable memory of a good man, and an upright and virtuous patriot.

But, if less fortunate or too late grown wise, I had seen myself reduced to end an infirm and languishing life in other climates, vainly regretting that peaceful repose which I had forfeited in the imprudence of youth, I should at least have entertained the same feelings in my heart, though denied the opportunity of making use of them in my native country. Filled with a tender and disinterested love for my distant fellow-citizens, I should have addressed them from my heart, much in the following terms:

“My dear fellow-citizens, or rather my brothers, since the ties of blood, as well as the laws, unite almost all of us, it gives me pleasure that I cannot think of you, without thinking, at the same time, of all the blessings you enjoy, and of which none of you, perhaps, more deeply feels the value than I who have lost them. The more I reflect on your civil and political condition, the less can I conceive that the nature of human affairs could admit of a better. In all other governments, when there is a question of ensuring the greatest good of the State, nothing gets beyond projects and ideas, or at best bare possibilities. But as for you, your happiness is complete, and you have nothing to do but enjoy it; you require nothing more to be made perfectly happy, than to know how to be satisfied with being so. Your sovereignty, acquired or recovered by the sword, and maintained for two centuries past by your valour and wisdom, is at length fully and universally acknowledged. Your boundaries are fixed, your rights confirmed and your repose secured by honourable treaties. Your constitution is excellent, being not only dictated by the profoundest wisdom, but guaranteed by great and friendly powers. Your State enjoys perfect tranquillity; you have neither wars nor conquerors to fear; you have no other master than the wise laws you have yourselves made; and these are administered by upright magistrates of your own choosing. You are neither so wealthy as to be enervated by effeminacy, and thence to lose, in the pursuit of frivolous pleasures, the taste for real happiness and solid virtue; nor poor enough to require more assistance from abroad than your own industry is sufficient to procure you. In the meantime the precious privilege of liberty, which in great nations is maintained only by submission to the most exorbitant impositions, costs you hardly anything for its preservation.

“May a Republic, so wisely and happily constituted, last for ever, for an example to other nations, and for the felicity of its own citizens! This is the only prayer you have left to make, the only precaution that remains to be taken. It depends, for the future, on yourselves alone (not to make you happy, for your ancestors have saved you that trouble), but to render that happiness lasting, by your wisdom in its enjoyment. It is on your constant union, your obedience to the laws, and your respect for their ministers, that your preservation depends. If there remains among you the smallest trace of bitterness or distrust, hasten to destroy it, as an accursed leaven which sooner or later must bring misfortune and ruin on the State. I conjure you all to look into your hearts, and to hearken to the secret voice of conscience. Is there any among you who can find, throughout the universe, a more upright, more enlightened and more honourable body than your magistracy? Do not all its members set you an example of moderation, of simplicity of manners, of respect for the laws, and of the most sincere harmony? Place, therefore, without reserve, in such wise superiors, that salutary confidence which reason ever owes to virtue. Consider that they are your own choice, that they justify that choice, and that the honours due to those whom you have dignified are necessarily yours by reflexion. Not one of you is so ignorant as not to know that, when the laws lose their force and those who defend them their authority, security and liberty are universally impossible. Why, therefore, should you hesitate to do that cheerfully and with just confidence which you would all along have been bound to do by your true interest, your duty and reason itself?

“Let not a culpable and pernicious indifference to the maintenance of the constitution ever induce you to neglect, in case of need, the prudent advice of the most enlightened and zealous of your fellow-citizens; but let equity, moderation and firmness of resolution continue to regulate all your proceedings, and to exhibit you to the whole universe as the example of a valiant and modest people, jealous equally of their honour and of their liberty. Beware particularly, as the last piece of advice I shall give you, of sinister constructions and venomous rumours, the secret motives of which are often more dangerous than the actions at which they are levelled. A whole house will be awake and take the first alarm given by a good and trusty watch-dog, who barks only at the approach of thieves; but we hate the importunity of those noisy curs, which are perpetually disturbing the public repose, and whose continual ill-timed warnings prevent our attending to them, when they may perhaps be necessary.”

And you, most honourable and magnificent lords, the worthy and revered magistrates of a free people, permit me to offer you in particular my duty and homage. If there is in the world a station capable of conferring honour on those who fill it, it is undoubtedly that which virtue and talents combine to bestow, that of which you have made yourselves worthy, and to which you have been promoted by your fellow-citizens. Their worth adds a new lustre to your own; while, as you have been chosen, by men capable of governing others, to govern themselves, I cannot but hold you as much superior to all other magistrates, as a free people, and particularly that over which you have the honour to preside, is by its wisdom and its reason superior to the populace of other States.

Be it permitted me to cite an example of which there ought to have existed better records, and one which will be ever near to my heart. I cannot recall to mind, without the sweetest emotions, the memory of that virtuous citizen, to whom I owe my being, and by whom I was often instructed, in my infancy, in the respect which is due to you. I see him still, living by the work of his hands, and feeding his soul on the sublimest truths. I see the works of Tacitus, Plutarch, and Grotius lying before him in the midst of the tools of his trade. At his side stands his dear son, receiving, alas with too little profit, the tender instructions of the best of fathers. But, if the follies of youth made me for a while forget his wise lessons, I have at length the happiness to be conscious that, whatever propensity one may have to vice, it is not easy for an education, with which love has mingled, to be entirely thrown away.

Such, my most honourable and magnificent lords, are the citizens, and even the common inhabitants of the State which you govern; such are those intelligent and sensible men, of whom, under the name of workmen and the people, it is usual, in other nations, to have a low and false opinion. My father, I own with pleasure, was in no way distinguished among his fellow-citizens. He was only such as they all are; and yet, such as he was, there is no country, in which his acquaintance would not have been coveted, and cultivated even with advantage by men of the highest character. It would not become me, nor is it, thank Heaven, at all necessary for me to remind you of the regard which such men have a right to expect of their magistrates, to whom they are equal both by education and by the rights of nature and birth, and inferior only, by their own will, by that preference which they owe to your merit, and, for giving you, can claim some sort of acknowledgment on your side. It is with a lively satisfaction I understand that the greatest candour and condescension attend, in all your behaviour towards them, on that gravity which becomes the ministers of the law; and that you so well repay them, by your esteem and attention, the respect and obedience which they owe to you. This conduct is not only just but prudent; as it happily tends to obliterate the memory of many unhappy events, which ought to be buried in eternal oblivion. It is also so much the more judicious, as it tends to make this generous and equitable people find a pleasure in their duty; to make them naturally love to do you honour, and to cause those who are the most zealous in the maintenance of their own rights to be at the same time the most disposed to respect yours.

It ought not to be thought surprising that the rulers of a civil society should have the welfare and glory of their communities at heart; but it is uncommonly fortunate for the peace of men, when those persons who look upon themselves as the magistrates, or rather the masters of a more holy and sublime country, show some love for the earthly country which maintains them. I am happy in having it in my power to make so singular an exception in our favour, and to be able to rank, among its best citizens, those zealous depositaries of the sacred articles of faith established by the laws, those venerable shepherds of souls whose powerful and captivating eloquence are so much the better calculated to bear to men's hearts the maxims of the gospel, as they are themselves the first to put them into practice. All the world knows of the great success with which the art of the pulpit is cultivated at Geneva; but men are so used to hearing divines preach one thing and practise another, that few have a chance of knowing how far the spirit of Christianity, holiness of manners, severity towards themselves and indulgence towards their neighbours, prevail throughout the whole body of our ministers. It is, perhaps, given to the city of Geneva alone, to produce the edifying example of so perfect a union between its clergy and men of letters. It is in great measure on their wisdom, their known moderation, and their zeal for the prosperity of the State that I build my hopes of its perpetual tranquillity. At the same time, I notice, with a pleasure mingled with surprise and veneration, how much they detest the frightful maxims of those accursed and barbarous men, of whom history furnishes us with more than one example; who, in order to support the pretended rights of God, that is to say their own interests, have been so much the less greedy of human blood, as they were more hopeful their own in particular would be always respected.

I must not forget that precious half of the Republic, which makes the happiness of the other; and whose sweetness and prudence preserve its tranquillity and virtue. Amiable and virtuous daughters of Geneva, it will be always the lot of your sex to govern ours. Happy are we, so long as your chaste influence, solely exercised within the limits of conjugal union, is exerted only for the glory of the State and the happiness of the public. It was thus the female sex commanded at Sparta; and thus you deserve to command at Geneva. What man can be such a barbarian as to resist the voice of honour and reason, coming from the lips of an affectionate wife? Who would not despise the vanities of luxury, on beholding the simple and modest attire which, from the lustre it derives from you, seems the most favourable to beauty? It is your task to perpetuate, by your insinuating influence and your innocent and amiable rule, a respect for the laws of the State, and harmony among the citizens. It is yours to reunite divided families by happy marriages; and, above all things, to correct, by the persuasive sweetness of your lessons and the modest graces of your conversation, those extravagancies which our young people pick up in other countries, whence, instead of many useful things by which they might profit, they bring home hardly anything, besides a puerile air and a ridiculous manner, acquired among loose women, but an admiration for I know not what so-called grandeur, and paltry recompenses for being slaves, which can never come near the real greatness of liberty. Continue, therefore, always to be what you are, the chaste guardians of our morals, and the sweet security for our peace, exerting on every occasion the privileges of the heart and of nature, in the interests of duty and virtue.

I flatter myself that I shall never be proved to have been mistaken, in building on such a foundation my hopes of the general happiness of the citizens and the glory of the Republic. It must be confessed, however, that with all these advantages, it will not shine with that lustre, by which the eyes of most men are dazzled; a puerile and fatal taste for which is the most mortal enemy of happiness and liberty.

Let our dissolute youth seek elsewhere light pleasures and long repentances. Let our pretenders to taste admire elsewhere the grandeur of palaces, the beauty of equipages, sumptuous furniture, the pomp of public entertainments, and all the refinements of luxury and effeminacy. Geneva boasts nothing but men; such a sight has nevertheless a value of its own, and those who have a taste for it are well worth the admirers of all the rest.

Deign, most honourable, magnificent and sovereign lords, to receive, and with equal goodness, this respectful testimony of the interest I take in your common prosperity. And, if I have been so unhappy as to be guilty of any indiscreet transport in this glowing effusion of my heart, I beseech you to pardon me, and to attribute it to the tender affection of a true patriot, and to the ardent and legitimate zeal of a man, who can imagine for himself no greater felicity than to see you happy.

Most honourable, magnificent and sovereign lords, I am, with the most profound respect,

Your most humble and obedient servant and fellow-citizen,

J. J. Rousseau

Chambéry, June 12, 1754





Preface


OF all human sciences the most useful and most imperfect appears to me to be that of mankind, and I will venture to say, the single inscription on the Temple of Delphi contained a precept more difficult and more important than is to be found in all the huge volumes that moralists have ever written. I consider the subject of the following discourse as one of the most interesting questions philosophy can propose, and unhappily for us, one of the most thorny that philosophers can have to solve. For how shall we know the source of inequality between men, if we do not begin by knowing mankind? And how shall man hope to see himself as nature made him, across all the changes which the succession of place and time must have produced in his original constitution? How can he distinguish what is fundamental in his nature from the changes and additions which his circumstances and the advances he has made have introduced to modify his primitive condition? Like the statue of Glaucus, which was so disfigured by time, seas and tempests, that it looked more like a wild beast than a god; the human soul, altered in society by a thousand causes perpetually recurring, by the acquisition of a multitude of truths and errors, by the changes happening to the constitution of the body, and by the continual jarring of the passions, has, so to speak, changed in appearance, so as to be hardly recognisable. Instead of a being, acting constantly from fixed and invariable principles, instead of that celestial and majestic simplicity, impressed on it by its divine Author, we find in it only the frightful contrast of passion mistaking itself for reason, and of understanding grown delirious.

It is still more cruel that, as every advance made by the human species removes it still farther from its primitive state, the more discoveries we make, the more we deprive ourselves of the means of making the most important of all. Thus it is, in one sense, by our very study of man, that the knowledge of him is put out of our power.

It is easy to perceive that it is in these successive changes in the constitution of man that we must look for the origin of those differences which now distinguish men, who, it is allowed, are as equal among themselves as were the animals of every kind, before physical causes had introduced those varieties which are now observable among some of them.

It is, in fact, not to be conceived that these primary changes, however they may have arisen, could have altered, all at once and in the same manner, every individual of the species. It is natural to think that, while the condition of some of them grew better or worse, and they were acquiring various good or bad qualities not inherent in their nature, there were others who continued a longer time in their original condition. Such was doubtless the first source of the inequality of mankind, which it is much easier to point out thus in general terms, than to assign with precision to its actual causes.

Let not my readers therefore imagine that I flatter myself with having seen what it appears to me so difficult to discover. I have here entered upon certain arguments, and risked some conjectures, less in the hope of solving the difficulty, than with a view to throwing some light upon it, and reducing the question to its proper form. Others may easily proceed farther on the same road, and yet no one find it very easy to get to the end. For it is by no means a light undertaking to distinguish properly between what is original and what is artificial in the actual nature of man, or to form a true idea of a state which no longer exists, perhaps never did exist, and probably never will exist; and of which, it is, nevertheless, necessary to have true ideas, in order to form a proper judgment of our present state. It requires, indeed, more philosophy than can be imagined to enable any one to determine exactly what precautions he ought to take, in order to make solid observations on this subject; and it appears to me that a good solution of the following problem would be not unworthy of the Aristotles and Plinys of the present age. What experiments would have to be made, to discover the natural man? And how are those experiments to be made in a state of society?

So far am I from undertaking to solve this problem, that I think I have sufficiently considered the subject, to venture to declare beforehand that our greatest philosophers would not be too good to direct such experiments, and our most powerful sovereigns to make them. Such a combination we have very little reason to expect, especially attended with the perseverance, or rather succession of intelligence and goodwill necessary on both sides to success.

These investigations, which are so difficult to make, and have been hitherto so little thought of, are, nevertheless, the only means that remain of obviating a multitude of difficulties which deprive us of the knowledge of the real foundations of human society. It is this ignorance of the nature of man, which casts so much uncertainty and obscurity on the true definition of natural right: for, the idea of right, says Burlamaqui, and more particularly that of natural right, are ideas manifestly relative to the nature of man. It is then from this very nature itself, he goes on, from the constitution and state of man, that we must deduce the first principles of this science.

We cannot see without surprise and disgust how little agreement there is between the different authors who have treated this great subject. Among the more important writers there are scarcely two of the same mind about it. Not to speak of the ancient philosophers, who seem to have done their best purposely to contradict one another on the most fundamental principles. The Roman jurists subjected man and the other animals indiscriminately to the same natural law, because they considered, under that name, rather the law which nature imposes on herself than that which she prescribes to others; or rather because of the particular acceptation of the term law among those jurists; who seem on this occasion to have understood nothing more by it than the general relations established by nature between all animated beings, for their common preservation. The moderns, understanding, by the term law, merely a rule prescribed to a moral being, that is to say intelligent, free and considered in his relations to other beings, consequently confine the jurisdiction of natural law to man, as the only animal endowed with reason. But, defining this law, each after his own fashion, they have established it on such metaphysical principles, that there are very few persons among us capable of comprehending them, much less of discovering them for themselves. So that the definitions of these learned men, all differing in everything else, agree only in this, that it is impossible to comprehend the law of nature, and consequently to obey it, without being a very subtle casuist and a profound metaphysician. All which is as much as to say that mankind must have employed, in the establishment of society, a capacity which is acquired only with great difficulty, and by very few persons, even in a state of society.

Knowing so little of nature, and agreeing so ill about the meaning of the word law, it would be difficult for us to fix on a good definition of natural law. Thus all the definitions we meet with in books, setting aside their defect in point of uniformity, have yet another fault, in that they are derived from many kinds of knowledge, which men do not possess naturally, and from advantages of which they can have no idea until they have already departed from that state. Modern writers begin by inquiring what rules it would be expedient for men to agree on for their common interest, and then give the name of natural law to a collection of these rules, without any other proof than the good that would result from their being universally practised. This is undoubtedly a simple way of making definitions, and of explaining the nature of things by almost arbitrary conveniences.

But as long as we are ignorant of the natural man, it is in vain for us to attempt to determine either the law originally prescribed to him, or that which is best adapted to his constitution. All we can know with any certainty respecting this law is that, if it is to be a law, not only the wills of those it obliges must be sensible of their submission to it; but also, to be natural, it must come directly from the voice of nature.

Throwing aside, therefore, all those scientific books, which teach us only to see men such as they have made themselves, and contemplating the first and most simple operations of the human soul, I think I can perceive in it two principles prior to reason, one of them deeply interesting us in our own welfare and preservation, and the other exciting a natural repugnance at seeing any other sensible being, and particularly any of our own species, suffer pain or death. It is from the agreement and combination which the understanding is in a position to establish between these two principles, without its being necessary to introduce that of sociability, that all the rules of natural right appear to me to be derived — rules which our reason is afterwards obliged to establish on other foundations, when by its successive developments it has been led to suppress nature itself.

In proceeding thus, we shall not be obliged to make man a philosopher before he is a man. His duties toward others are not dictated to him only by the later lessons of wisdom; and, so long as he does not resist the internal impulse of compassion, he will never hurt any other man, nor even any sentient being, except on those lawful occasions on which his own preservation is concerned and he is obliged to give himself the preference. By this method also we put an end to the time-honoured disputes concerning the participation of animals in natural law: for it is clear that, being destitute of intelligence and liberty, they cannot recognise that law; as they partake, however, in some measure of our nature, in consequence of the sensibility with which they are endowed, they ought to partake of natural right; so that mankind is subjected to a kind of obligation even toward the brutes. It appears, in fact, that if I am bound to do no injury to my fellow-creatures, this is less because they are rational than because they are sentient beings: and this quality, being common both to men and beasts, ought to entitle the latter at least to the privilege of not being wantonly ill-treated by the former.

The very study of the original man, of his real wants, and the fundamental principles of his duty, is besides the only proper method we can adopt to obviate all the difficulties which the origin of moral inequality presents, on the true foundations of the body politic, on the reciprocal rights of its members, and on many other similar topics equally important and obscure.

If we look at human society with a calm and disinterested eye, it seems, at first, to show us only the violence of the powerful and the oppression of the weak. The mind is shocked at the cruelty of the one, or is induced to lament the blindness of the other; and as nothing is less permanent in life than those external relations, which are more frequently produced by accident than wisdom, and which are called weakness or power, riches or poverty, all human institutions seem at first glance to be founded merely on banks of shifting sand. It is only by taking a closer look, and removing the dust and sand that surround the edifice, that we perceive the immovable basis on which it is raised, and learn to respect its foundations. Now, without a serious study of man, his natural faculties and their successive development, we shall never be able to make these necessary distinctions, or to separate, in the actual constitution of things, that which is the effect of the divine will, from the innovations attempted by human art. The political and moral investigations, therefore, to which the important question before us leads, are in every respect useful; while the hypothetical history of governments affords a lesson equally instructive to mankind.

In considering what we should have become, had we been left to ourselves, we should learn to bless Him, whose gracious hand, correcting our institutions, and giving them an immovable basis, has prevented those disorders which would otherwise have arisen from them, and caused our happiness to come from those very sources which seemed likely to involve us in misery.





A Dissertation on the Origin and Foundation of the Inequality of Mankind


IT is of man that I have to speak; and the question I am investigating shows me that it is to men that I must address myself: for questions of this sort are not asked by those who are afraid to honour truth. I shall then confidently uphold the cause of humanity before the wise men who invite me to do so, and shall not be dissatisfied if I acquit myself in a manner worthy of my subject and of my judges.

I conceive that there are two kinds of inequality among the human species: one, which I call natural or physical, because it is established by nature, and consists in a difference of age, health, bodily strength, and the qualities of the mind or of the soul; and another, which may be called moral or political inequality, because it depends on a kind of convention, and is established, or at least authorised by the consent of men. This latter consists of the different privileges, which some men enjoy to the prejudice of others; such as that of being more rich, more honoured, more powerful or even in a position to exact obedience.

It is useless to ask what is the source of natural inequality, because that question is answered by the simple definition of the word. Again, it is still more useless to inquire whether there is any essential connection between the two inequalities; for this would be only asking, in other words, whether those who command are necessarily better than those who obey, and if strength of body or of mind, wisdom or virtue are always found in particular individuals, in proportion to their power or wealth: a question fit perhaps to be discussed by slaves in the hearing of their masters, but highly unbecoming to reasonable and free men in search of the truth.

The subject of the present discourse, therefore, is more precisely this: to mark, in the progress of things, the moment at which right took the place of violence and nature became subject to law, and to explain by what sequence of miracles the strong came to submit to serve the weak, and the people to purchase imaginary repose at the expense of real felicity.

The philosophers, who have inquired into the foundations of society, have all felt the necessity of going back to a state of nature; but not one of them has got there. Some of them have not hesitated to ascribe to man, in such a state, the idea of just and unjust, without troubling themselves to show that he must be possessed of such an idea, or that it could be of any use to him. Others have spoken of the natural right of every man to keep what belongs to him, without explaining what they meant by belongs. Others again, beginning by giving the strong authority over the weak, proceeded directly to the birth of government, without regard to the time that must have elapsed before the meaning of the words authority and government could have existed among men. Every one of them, in short, constantly dwelling on wants, avidity, oppression, desires and pride, has transferred to the state of nature ideas which were acquired in society; so that, in speaking of the savage, they described the social man. It has not even entered into the heads of most of our writers to doubt whether the state of nature ever existed; but it is clear from the Holy Scriptures that the first man, having received his understanding and commandments immediately from God, was not himself in such a state; and that, if we give such credit to the writings of Moses as every Christian philosopher ought to give, we must deny that, even before the deluge, men were ever in the pure state of nature; unless, indeed, they fell back into it from some very extraordinary circumstance; a paradox which it would be very embarrassing to defend, and quite impossible to prove.

Let us begin then by laying facts aside, as they do not affect the question. The investigations we may enter into, in treating this subject, must not be considered as historical truths, but only as mere conditional and hypothetical reasonings, rather calculated to explain the nature of things, than to ascertain their actual origin; just like the hypotheses which our physicists daily form respecting the formation of the world. Religion commands us to believe that, God Himself having taken men out of a state of nature immediately after the creation, they are unequal only because it is His will they should be so: but it does not forbid us to form conjectures based solely on the nature of man, and the beings around him, concerning what might have become of the human race, if it had been left to itself. This then is the question asked me, and that which I propose to discuss in the following discourse. As my subject interests mankind in general, I shall endeavour to make use of a style adapted to all nations, or rather, forgetting time and place, to attend only to men to whom I am speaking. I shall suppose myself in the Lyceum of Athens, repeating the lessons of my masters, with Plato and Xenocrates for judges, and the whole human race for audience.

O man, of whatever country you are, and whatever your opinions may be, behold your history, such as I have thought to read it, not in books written by your fellow-creatures, who are liars, but in nature, which never lies. All that comes from her will be true; nor will you meet with anything false, unless I have involuntarily put in something of my own. The times of which I am going to speak are very remote: how much are you changed from what you once were! It is, so to speak, the life of your species which I am going to write, after the qualities which you have received, which your education and habits may have depraved, but cannot have entirely destroyed. There is, I feel, an age at which the individual man would wish to stop: you are about to inquire about the age at which you would have liked your whole species to stand still. Discontented with your present state, for reasons which threaten your unfortunate descendants with still greater discontent, you will perhaps wish it were in your power to go back; and this feeling should be a panegyric on your first ancestors, a criticism of your contemporaries, and a terror to the unfortunates who will come after you.





The First Part


IMPORTANT as it may be, in order to judge rightly of the natural state of man, to consider him from his origin, and to examine him, as it were, in the embryo of his species; I shall not follow his organisation through its successive developments, nor shall I stay to inquire what his animal system must have been at the beginning, in order to become at length what it actually is. I shall not ask whether his long nails were at first, as Aristotle supposes, only crooked talons; whether his whole body, like that of a bear, was not covered with hair; or whether the fact that he walked upon all fours, with his looks directed toward the earth, confined to a horizon of a few paces, did not at once point out the nature and limits of his ideas. On this subject I could form none but vague and almost imaginary conjectures. Comparative anatomy has as yet made too little progress, and the observations of naturalists are too uncertain to afford an adequate basis for any solid reasoning. So that, without having recourse to the supernatural information given us on this head, or paying any regard to the changes which must have taken place in the internal, as well as the external, conformation of man, as he applied his limbs to new uses, and fed himself on new kinds of food, I shall suppose his conformation to have been at all times what it appears to us at this day; that he always walked on two legs, made use of his hands as we do, directed his looks over all nature, and measured with his eyes the vast expanse of Heaven.

If we strip this being, thus constituted, of all the supernatural gifts he may have received, and all the artificial faculties he can have acquired only by a long process; if we consider him, in a word, just as he must have come from the hands of nature, we behold in him an animal weaker than some, and less agile than others; but, taking him all round, the most advantageously organised of any. I see him satisfying his hunger at the first oak, and slaking his thirst at the first brook; finding his bed at the foot of the tree which afforded him a repast; and, with that, all his wants supplied.

While the earth was left to its natural fertility and covered with immense forests, whose trees were never mutilated by the axe, it would present on every side both sustenance and shelter for every species of animal. Men, dispersed up and down among the rest, would observe and imitate their industry, and thus attain even to the instinct of the beasts, with the advantage that, whereas every species of brutes was confined to one particular instinct, man, who perhaps has not any one peculiar to himself, would appropriate them all, and live upon most of those different foods which other animals shared among themselves; and thus would find his subsistence much more easily than any of the rest.

Accustomed from their infancy to the inclemencies of the weather and the rigour of the seasons, inured to fatigue, and forced, naked and unarmed, to defend themselves and their prey from other ferocious animals, or to escape them by flight, men would acquire a robust and almost unalterable constitution. The children, bringing with them into the world the excellent constitution of their parents, and fortifying it by the very exercises which first produced it, would thus acquire all the vigour of which the human frame is capable. Nature in this case treats them exactly as Sparta treated the children of her citizens: those who come well formed into the world she renders strong and robust, and all the rest she destroys; differing in this respect from our modern communities, in which the State, by making children a burden to their parents, kills them indiscriminately before they are born.

The body of a savage man being the only instrument he understands, he uses it for various purposes, of which ours, for want of practice, are incapable: for our industry deprives us of that force and agility, which necessity obliges him to acquire. If he had had an axe, would he have been able with his naked arm to break so large a branch from a tree? If he had had a sling, would he have been able to throw a stone with so great velocity? If he had had a ladder, would he have been so nimble in climbing a tree? If he had had a horse, would he have been himself so swift of foot? Give civilised man time to gather all his machines about him, and he will no doubt easily beat the savage; but if you would see a still more unequal contest, set them together naked and unarmed, and you will soon see the advantage of having all our forces constantly at our disposal, of being always prepared for every event, and of carrying one's self, as it were, perpetually whole and entire about one.

Hobbes contends that man is naturally intrepid, and is intent only upon attacking and fighting. Another illustrious philosopher holds the opposite, and Cumberland and Puffendorf also affirm that nothing is more timid and fearful than man in the state of nature; that he is always in a tremble, and ready to fly at the least noise or the slightest movement. This may be true of things he does not know; and I do not doubt his being terrified by every novelty that presents itself, when he neither knows the physical good or evil he may expect from it, nor can make a comparison between his own strength and the dangers he is about to encounter. Such circumstances, however, rarely occur in a state of nature, in which all things proceed in a uniform manner, and the face of the earth is not subject to those sudden and continual changes which arise from the passions and caprices of bodies of men living together. But savage man, living dispersed among other animals, and finding himself betimes in a situation to measure his strength with theirs, soon comes to compare himself with them; and, perceiving that he surpasses them more in adroitness than they surpass him in strength, learns to be no longer afraid of them. Set a bear, or a wolf, against a robust, agile, and resolute savage, as they all are, armed with stones and a good cudgel, and you will see that the danger will be at least on both sides, and that, after a few trials of this kind, wild beasts, which are not fond of attacking each other, will not be at all ready to attack man, whom they will have found to be as wild and ferocious as themselves. With regard to such animals as have really more strength than man has adroitness, he is in the same situation as all weaker animals, which notwithstanding are still able to subsist; except indeed that he has the advantage that, being equally swift of foot, and finding an almost certain place of refuge in every tree, he is at liberty to take or leave it at every encounter, and thus to fight or fly, as he chooses. Add to this that it does not appear that any animal naturally makes war on man, except in case of self-defence or excessive hunger, or betrays any of those violent antipathies, which seem to indicate that one species is intended by nature for the food of another.

This is doubtless why negroes and savages are so little afraid of the wild beasts they may meet in the woods. The Caribs of Venezuela among others live in this respect in absolute security and without the smallest inconvenience. Though they are almost naked, Francis Corréal tells us, they expose themselves freely in the woods, armed only with bows and arrows; but no one has ever heard of one of them being devoured by wild beasts.

But man has other enemies more formidable, against which he is not provided with such means of defence: these are the natural infirmities of infancy, old age, and illness of every kind, melancholy proofs of our weakness, of which the two first are common to all animals, and the last belongs chiefly to man in a state of society. With regard to infancy, it is observable that the mother, carrying her child always with her, can nurse it with much greater ease than the females of many other animals, which are forced to be perpetually going and coming, with great fatigue, one way to find subsistence, and another to suckle or feed their young. It is true that if the woman happens to perish, the infant is in great danger of perishing with her; but this risk is common to many other species of animals, whose young take a long time before they are able to provide for themselves. And if our infancy is longer than theirs, our lives are longer in proportion; so that all things are in this respect fairly equal; though there are other rules to be considered regarding the duration of the first period of life, and the number of young, which do not affect the present subject. In old age, when men are less active and perspire little, the need for food diminishes with the ability to provide it. As the savage state also protects them from gout and rheumatism, and old age is, of all ills, that which human aid can least alleviate, they cease to be, without others perceiving that they are no more, and almost without perceiving it themselves.

With respect to sickness, I shall not repeat the vain and false declamations which most healthy people pronounce against medicine; but I shall ask if any solid observations have been made from which it may be justly concluded that, in the countries where the art of medicine is most neglected, the mean duration of man's life is less than in those where it is most cultivated. How indeed can this be the case, if we bring on ourselves more diseases than medicine can furnish remedies? The great inequality in manner of living, the extreme idleness of some, and the excessive labour of others, the easiness of exciting and gratifying our sensual appetites, the too exquisite foods of the wealthy which overheat and fill them with indigestion, and, on the other hand, the unwholesome food of the poor, often, bad as it is, insufficient for their needs, which induces them, when opportunity offers, to eat voraciously and overcharge their stomachs; all these, together with sitting up late, and excesses of every kind, immoderate transports of every passion, fatigue, mental exhaustion, the innumerable pains and anxieties inseparable from every condition of life, by which the mind of man is incessantly tormented; these are too fatal proofs that the greater part of our ills are of our own making, and that we might have avoided them nearly all by adhering to that simple, uniform and solitary manner of life which nature prescribed. If she destined man to be healthy, I venture to declare that a state of reflection is a state contrary to nature, and that a thinking man is a depraved animal. When we think of the good constitution of the savages, at least of those whom we have not ruined with our spirituous liquors, and reflect that they are troubled with hardly any disorders, save wounds and old age, we are tempted to believe that, in following the history of civil society, we shall be telling also that of human sickness. Such, at least, was the opinion of Plato, who inferred from certain remedies prescribed, or approved, by Podalirius and Machaon at the siege of Troy, that several sicknesses which these remedies gave rise to in his time, were not then known to mankind: and Celsus tells us that diet, which is now so necessary, was first invented by Hippocrates.

Being subject therefore to so few causes of sickness, man, in the state of nature, can have no need of remedies, and still less of physicians: nor is the human race in this respect worse off than other animals, and it is easy to learn from hunters whether they meet with many infirm animals in the course of the chase. It is certain they frequently meet with such as carry the marks of having been considerably wounded, with many that have had bones or even limbs broken, yet have been healed without any other surgical assistance than that of time, or any other regimen than that of their ordinary life. At the same time their cures seem not to have been less perfect, for their not having been tortured by incisions, poisoned with drugs, or wasted by fasting. In short, however useful medicine, properly administered, may be among us, it is certain that, if the savage, when he is sick and left to himself, has nothing to hope but from nature, he has, on the other hand, nothing to fear but from his disease; which renders his situation often preferable to our own.

We should beware, therefore, of confounding the savage man with the men we have daily before our eyes. Nature treats all the animals left to her care with a predilection that seems to show how jealous she is of that right. The horse, the cat, the bull, and even the ass are generally of greater stature, and always more robust, and have more vigour, strength and courage, when they run wild in the forests than when bred in the stall. By becoming domesticated, they lose half these advantages; and it seems as if all our care to feed and treat them well serves only to deprave them. It is thus with man also: as he becomes sociable and a slave, he grows weak, timid and servile; his effeminate way of life totally enervates his strength and courage. To this it may be added that there is still a greater difference between savage and civilised man, than between wild and tame beasts: for men and brutes having been treated alike by nature, the several conveniences in which men indulge themselves still more than they do their beasts, are so many additional causes of their deeper degeneracy.

It is not therefore so great a misfortune to these primitive men, nor so great an obstacle to their preservation, that they go naked, have no dwellings and lack all the superfluities which we think so necessary. If their skins are not covered with hair, they have no need of such covering in warm climates; and, in cold countries, they soon learn to appropriate the skins of the beasts they have overcome. If they have but two legs to run with, they have two arms to defend themselves with, and provide for their wants. Their children are slowly and with difficulty taught to walk; but their mothers are able to carry them with ease; an advantage which other animals lack, as the mother, if pursued, is forced either to abandon her young, or to regulate her pace by theirs. Unless, in short, we suppose a singular and fortuitous concurrence of circumstances of which I shall speak later, and which would be unlikely to exist, it is plain in every state of the case, that the man who first made himself clothes or a dwelling was furnishing himself with things not at all necessary; for he had till then done without them, and there is no reason why he should not have been able to put up in manhood with the same kind of life as had been his in infancy.

Solitary, indolent, and perpetually accompanied by danger, the savage cannot but be fond of sleep; his sleep too must be light, like that of the animals, which think but little and may be said to slumber all the time they do not think. Self-preservation being his chief and almost sole concern, he must exercise most those faculties which are most concerned with attack or defence, either for overcoming his prey, or for preventing him from becoming the prey of other animals. On the other hand, those organs which are perfected only by softness and sensuality will remain in a gross and imperfect state, incompatible with any sort of delicacy; so that, his senses being divided on this head, his touch and taste will be extremely coarse, his sight, hearing and smell exceedingly fine and subtle. Such in general is the animal condition, and such, according to the narratives of travellers, is that of most savage nations. It is therefore no matter for surprise that the Hottentots of the Cape of Good Hope distinguish ships at sea, with the naked eye, at as great a distance as the Dutch can do with their telescopes; or that the savages of America should trace the Spaniards, by their smell, as well as the best dogs could have done; or that these barbarous peoples feel no pain in going naked, or that they use large quantities of piemento with their food, and drink the strongest European liquors like water.

Hitherto I have considered merely the physical man; let us now take a view of him on his metaphysical and moral side.

I see nothing in any animal but an ingenious machine, to which nature has given senses to wind itself up, and to guard itself, to a certain degree, against anything that might tend to disorder or destroy it. I perceive exactly the same things in the human machine, with this difference, that in the operations of the brute, nature is the sole agent, whereas man has some share in his own operations, in his character as a free agent. The one chooses and refuses by instinct, the other from an act of free-will: hence the brute cannot deviate from the rule prescribed to it, even when it would be advantageous for it to do so; and, on the contrary, man frequently deviates from such rules to his own prejudice. Thus a pigeon would be starved to death by the side of a dish of the choicest meats, and a cat on a heap of fruit or grain; though it is certain that either might find nourishment in the foods which it thus rejects with disdain, did it think of trying them. Hence it is that dissolute men run into excesses which bring on fevers and death; because the mind depraves the senses, and the will continues to speak when nature is silent.

Every animal has ideas, since it has senses; it even combines those ideas in a certain degree; and it is only in degree that man differs, in this respect, from the brute. Some philosophers have even maintained that there is a greater difference between one man and another than between some men and some beasts. It is not, therefore, so much the understanding that constitutes the specific difference between the man and the brute, as the human quality of free-agency. Nature lays her commands on every animal, and the brute obeys her voice. Man receives the same impulsion, but at the same time knows himself at liberty to acquiesce or resist: and it is particularly in his consciousness of this liberty that the spirituality of his soul is displayed. For physics may explain, in some measure, the mechanism of the senses and the formation of ideas; but in the power of willing or rather of choosing, and in the feeling of this power, nothing is to be found but acts which are purely spiritual and wholly inexplicable by the laws of mechanism.

However, even if the difficulties attending all these questions should still leave room for difference in this respect between men and brutes, there is another very specific quality which distinguishes them, and which will admit of no dispute. This is the faculty of self-improvement, which, by the help of circumstances, gradually develops all the rest of our faculties, and is inherent in the species as in the individual; whereas a brute is, at the end of a few months, all he will ever be during his whole life, and his species, at the end of a thousand years, exactly what it was the first year of that thousand. Why is man alone liable to grow into a dotard? Is it not because he returns, in this, to his primitive state; and that, while the brute, which has acquired nothing and has therefore nothing to lose, still retains the force of instinct, man, who loses, by age or accident, all that his perfectibility had enabled him to gain, falls by this means lower than the brutes themselves? It would be melancholy, were we forced to admit that this distinctive and almost unlimited faculty is the source of all human misfortunes; that it is this which, in time, draws man out of his original state, in which he would have spent his days insensibly in peace and innocence; that it is this faculty, which, successively producing in different ages his discoveries and his errors, his vices and his virtues, makes him at length a tyrant both over himself and over nature.(1) It would be shocking to be obliged to regard as a benefactor the man who first suggested to the Oroonoko Indians the use of the boards they apply to the temples of their children, which secure to them some part at least of their imbecility and original happiness.

Savage man, left by nature solely to the direction of instinct, or rather indemnified for what he may lack by faculties capable at first of supplying its place, and afterwards of raising him much above it, must accordingly begin with purely animal functions: thus seeing and feeling must be his first condition, which would be common to him and all other animals. To will, and not to will, to desire and to fear, must be the first, and almost the only operations of his soul, till new circumstances occasion new developments of his faculties.

Whatever moralists may hold, the human understanding is greatly indebted to the passions, which, it is universally allowed, are also much indebted to the understanding. It is by the activity of the passions that our reason is improved; for we desire knowledge only because we wish to enjoy; and it is impossible to conceive any reason why a person who has neither fears nor desires should give himself the trouble of reasoning. The passions, again, originate in our wants, and their progress depends on that of our knowledge; for we cannot desire or fear anything, except from the idea we have of it, or from the simple impulse of nature. Now savage man, being destitute of every species of intelligence, can have no passions save those of the latter kind: his desires never go beyond his physical wants. The only goods he recognises in the universe are food, a female, and sleep; the only evils he fears are pain and hunger. I say pain, and not death: for no animal can know what it is to die; the knowledge of death and its terrors being one of the first acquisitions made by man in departing from an animal state.

It would be easy, were it necessary, to support this opinion by facts, and to show that, in all the nations of the world, the progress of the understanding has been exactly proportionate to the wants which the peoples had received from nature, or been subjected to by circumstances, and in consequence to the passions that induced them to provide for those necessities. I might instance the arts, rising up in Egypt and expanding with the inundation of the Nile. I might follow their progress into Greece, where they took root afresh, grew up and lowered to the skies, among the rocks and sands of Attica, without being able to germinate on the fertile banks of the Eurotas; I might observe that in general, the people of the North are more industrious than those of the South, because they cannot get on so well without being so; as if nature wanted to equalise matters by giving their understandings the fertility she had refused to their soil.

But who does not see, without recurring to the uncertain testimony of history, that everything seems to remove from savage man both the temptation and the means of changing his condition? His imagination paints no pictures; his heart makes no demands on him. His few wants are so readily supplied, and he is so far from having the knowledge which is needful to make him want more, that he can have neither foresight nor curiosity. The face of nature becomes indifferent to him as it grows familiar. He sees in it always the same order, the same successions: he has not understanding enough to wonder at the greatest miracles; nor is it in his mind that we can expect to find that philosophy man needs, if he is to know how to notice for once what he sees every day. His soul, which nothing disturbs, is wholly wrapped up in the feeling of its present existence, without any idea of the future, however near at hand; while his projects, as limited as his views, hardly extend to the close of day. Such, even at present, is the extent of the native Caribbean's foresight: he will improvidently sell you his cotton-bed in the morning, and come crying in the evening to buy it again, not having foreseen he would want it again the next night.

The more we reflect on this subject, the greater appears the distance between pure sensation and the most simple knowledge: it is impossible indeed to conceive how a man, by his own powers alone, without the aid of communication and the spur of necessity, could have bridged so great a gap. How many ages may have elapsed before mankind were in a position to behold any other fire than that of the heavens! What a multiplicity of chances must have happened to teach them the commonest uses of that element! How often must they have let it out before they acquired the art of reproducing it? and how often may not such a secret have died with him who had discovered it? What shall we say of agriculture, an art which requires so much labour and foresight, which is so dependent on others that it is plain it could only be practised in a society which had at least begun, and which does not serve so much to draw the means of subsistence from the earth — for these it would produce of itself — but to compel it to produce what is most to our taste? But let us suppose that men had so multiplied that the natural produce of the earth was no longer sufficient for their support; a supposition, by the way, which would prove such a life to be very advantageous for the human race; let us suppose that, without forges or workshops, the instruments of husbandry had dropped from the sky into the hands of savages; that they had overcome their natural aversion to continual labour; that they had learnt so much foresight for their needs; that they had divined how to cultivate the earth, to sow grain and plant trees; that they had discovered the arts of grinding corn, and of setting the grape to ferment — all being things that must have been taught them by the gods, since it is not to be conceived how they could discover them for themselves — yet after all this, what man among them would be so absurd as to take the trouble of cultivating a field, which might be stripped of its crop by the first comer, man or beast, that might take a liking to it; and how should each of them resolve to pass his life in wearisome labour, when, the more necessary to him the reward of his labour might be, the surer he would be of not getting it? In a word, how could such a situation induce men to cultivate the earth, till it was regularly parcelled out among them; that is to say, till the state of nature had been abolished?

Were we to suppose savage man as trained in the art of thinking as philosophers make him; were we, like them, to suppose him a very philosopher capable of investigating the sublimest truths, and of forming, by highly abstract chains of reasoning, maxims of reason and justice, deduced from the love of order in general, or the known will of his Creator; in a word, were we to suppose him as intelligent and enlightened, as he must have been, and is in fact found to have been, dull and stupid; what advantage would accrue to the species, from all such metaphysics, which could not be communicated by one to another, but must end with him who made them? What progress could be made by mankind, while dispersed in the woods among other animals? and how far could men improve or mutually enlighten one another, when, having no fixed habitation, and no need of one another's assistance, the same persons hardly met twice in their lives, and perhaps then, without knowing one another or speaking together?

Let it be considered how many ideas we owe to the use of speech; how far grammar exercises the understanding and facilitates its operations. Let us reflect on the inconceivable pains and the infinite space of time that the first invention of languages must have cost. To these reflections add what preceded, and then judge how many thousand ages must have elapsed in the successive development in the human mind of those operations of which it is capable.

I shall here take the liberty for a moment, of considering the difficulties of the origin of languages, on which subject I might content myself with a simple repetition of the Abbé Condillac's investigations, as they fully confirm my system, and perhaps even first suggested it. But it is plain, from the manner in which this philosopher solves the difficulties he himself raises, concerning the origin of arbitrary signs, that he assumes what I question, viz., that a kind of society must already have existed among the first inventors of language. While I refer, therefore, to his observations on this head, I think it right to give my own, in order to exhibit the same difficulties in a light adapted to my subject. The first which presents itself is to conceive how language can have become necessary; for as there was no communication among men and no need for any, we can neither conceive the necessity of this invention, nor the possibility of it, if it was not somehow indispensable. I might affirm, with many others, that languages arose in the domestic intercourse between parents and their children. But this expedient would not obviate the difficulty, and would besides involve the blunder made by those who, in reasoning on the state of nature, always import into it ideas gathered in a state of society. Thus they constantly consider families as living together under one roof, and the individuals of each as observing among themselves a union as intimate and permanent as that which exists among us, where so many common interests unite them; whereas, in this primitive state, men had neither houses, nor huts, nor any kind of property whatever; every one lived where he could, seldom for more than a single night; the sexes united without design, as accident, opportunity or inclination brought them together, nor had they any great need of words to communicate their designs to each other; and they parted with the same indifference. The mother gave suck to her children at first for her own sake; and afterwards, when habit had made them dear, for theirs; but as soon as they were strong enough to go in search of their own food, they forsook her of their own accord; and, as they had hardly any other method of not losing one another than that of remaining continually within sight, they soon became quite incapable of recognising one another when they happened to meet again. It is farther to be observed that the child, having all his wants to explain, and of course more to say to his mother than the mother could have to say to him, must have borne the brunt of the task of invention, and the language he used would be of his own device, so that the number of languages would be equal to that of the individuals speaking them, and the variety would be increased by the vagabond and roving life they led, which would not give time for any idiom to become constant. For to say that the mother dictated to her child the words he was to use in asking her for one thing or another, is an explanation of how languages already formed are taught, but by no means explains how languages were originally formed.

We will suppose, however, that this first difficulty is obviated. Let us for a moment then take ourselves as being on this side of the vast space which must lie between a pure state of nature and that in which languages had become necessary, and, admitting their necessity, let us inquire how they could first be established. Here we have a new and worse difficulty to grapple with; for if men need speech to learn to think, they must have stood in much greater need of the art of thinking, to be able to invent that of speaking. And though we might conceive how the articulate sounds of the voice came to be taken as the conventional interpreters of our ideas, it would still remain for us to inquire what could have been the interpreters of this convention for those ideas, which, answering to no sensible objects, could not be indicated either by gesture or voice; so that we can hardly form any tolerable conjectures about the origin of this art of communicating our thoughts and establishing a correspondence between minds: an art so sublime, that far distant as it is from its origin, philosophers still behold it at such an immeasurable distance from perfection, that there is none rash enough to affirm it will ever reach it, even though the revolutions time necessarily produces were suspended in its favour, though prejudice should be banished from our academies or condemned to silence, and those learned societies should devote themselves uninterruptedly for whole ages to this thorny question.

The first language of mankind, the most universal and vivid, in a word the only language man needed, before he had occasion to exert his eloquence to persuade assembled multitudes, was the simple cry of nature. But as this was excited only by a sort of instinct on urgent occasions, to implore assistance in case of danger, or relief in case of suffering, it could be of little use in the ordinary course of life, in which more moderate feelings prevail. When the ideas of men began to expand and multiply, and closer communication took place among them, they strove to invent more numerous signs and a more copious language. They multiplied the inflections of the voice, and added gestures, which are in their own nature more expressive, and depend less for their meaning on a prior determination. Visible and movable objects were therefore expressed by gestures, and audible ones by imitative sounds; but, as hardly anything can be indicated by gestures, except objects actually present or easily described, and visible actions; as they are not universally useful — for darkness or the interposition of a material object destroys their efficacy — and as besides they rather request than secure our attention; men at length bethought themselves of substituting for them the articulate sounds of the voice, which, without bearing the same relation to any particular ideas, are better calculated to express them all, as conventional signs. Such an institution could only be made by common consent, and must have been effected in a manner not very easy for men whose gross organs had not been accustomed to any such exercise. It is also in itself still more difficult to conceive, since such a common agreement must have had motives, and speech seems to have been highly necessary to establish the use of it.

It is reasonable to suppose that the words first made use of by mankind had a much more extensive signification than those used in languages already formed, and that ignorant as they were of the division of discourse into its constituent parts, they at first gave every single word the sense of a whole proposition. When they began to distinguish subject and attribute, and noun and verb, which was itself no common effort of genius, substantives were first only so many proper names; the present infinitive was the only tense of verbs; and the very idea of adjectives must have been developed with great difficulty; for every adjective is an abstract idea, and abstractions are painful and unnatural operations.

Every object at first received a particular name without regard to genus or species, which these primitive originators were not in a position to distinguish; every individual presented itself to their minds in isolation, as they are in the picture of nature. If one oak was called A, another was called B; for the primitive idea of two things is that they are not the same, and it often takes a long time for what they have in common to be seen; so that, the narrower the limits of their knowledge of things, the more copious their dictionary must have been. The difficulty of using such a vocabulary could not be easily removed; for, to arrange beings under common and generic denominations, it became necessary to know their distinguishing properties; the need arose for observation and definition, that is to say, for natural history and metaphysics of a far more developed kind than men can at that time have possessed.

Add to this, that general ideas cannot be introduced into the mind without the assistance of words, nor can the understanding seize them except by means of propositions. This is one of the reasons why animals cannot form such ideas, or ever acquire that capacity for self-improvement which depends on them. When a monkey goes from one nut to another, are we to conceive that he entertains any general idea of that kind of fruit, and compares its archetype with the two individual nuts? Assuredly he does not; but the sight of one of these nuts recalls to his memory the sensations which he received from the other, and his eyes, being modified after a certain manner, give information to the palate of the modification it is about to receive. Every general idea is purely intellectual; if the imagination meddles with it ever so little, the idea immediately becomes particular. If you endeavour to trace in your mind the image of a tree in general, you never attain to your end. In spite of all you can do, you will have to see it as great or little, bare or leafy, light or dark, and were you capable of seeing nothing in it but what is common to all trees, it would no longer be like a tree at all. Purely abstract beings are perceivable in the same manner, or are only conceivable by the help of language. The definition of a triangle alone gives you a true idea of it: the moment you imagine a triangle in your mind, it is some particular triangle and not another, and you cannot avoid giving it sensible lines and a coloured area. We must then make use of propositions and of language in order to form general ideas. For no sooner does the imagination cease to operate than the understanding proceeds only by the help of words. If then the first inventors of speech could give names only to ideas they already had, it follows that the first substantives could be nothing more than proper names.

But when our new grammarians, by means of which I have no conception, began to extend their ideas and generalise their terms, the ignorance of the inventors must have confined this method within very narrow limits; and, as they had at first gone too far in multiplying the names of individuals, from ignorance of their genus and species, they made afterwards too few of these, from not having considered beings in all their specific differences. It would indeed have needed more knowledge and experience than they could have, and more pains and inquiry than they would have bestowed, to carry these distinctions to their proper length. If, even today, we are continually discovering new species, which have hitherto escaped observation, let us reflect how many of them must have escaped men who judged things merely from their first appearance! It is superfluous to add that the primitive classes and the most general notions must necessarily have escaped their notice also. How, for instance, could they have understood or thought of the words matter, spirit, substance, mode, figure, motion, when even our philosophers, who have so long been making use of them, have themselves the greatest difficulty in understanding them; and when, the ideas attached to them being purely metaphysical, there are no models of them to be found in nature?

But I stop at this point, and ask my judges to suspend their reading a while, to consider, after the invention of physical substantives, which is the easiest part of language to invent, that there is still a great way to go, before the thoughts of men will have found perfect expression and constant form, such as would answer the purposes of public speaking, and produce their effect on society. I beg of them to consider how much time must have been spent, and how much knowledge needed, to find out numbers, abstract terms, aorists and all the tenses of verbs, particles, syntax, the method of connecting propositions, the forms of reasoning, and all the logic of speech. For myself, I am so aghast at the increasing difficulties which present themselves, and so well convinced of the almost demonstrable impossibility that languages should owe their original institution to merely human means, that I leave, to anyone who will undertake it, the discussion of the difficult problem, which was most necessary, the existence of society to the invention of language, or the invention of language to the establishment of society.

But be the origin of language and society what they may, it may be at least inferred, from the little care which nature has taken to unite mankind by mutual wants, and to facilitate the use of speech, that she has contributed little to make them sociable, and has put little of her own into all they have done to create such bonds of union. It is in fact impossible to conceive why, in a state of nature, one man should stand more in need of the assistance of another, than a monkey or a wolf of the assistance of another of its kind: or, granting that he did, what motives could induce that other to assist him; or, even then, by what means they could agree about the conditions. I know it is incessantly repeated that man would in such a state have been the most miserable of creatures; and indeed, if it be true, as I think I have proved, that he must have lived many ages, before he could have either desire or an opportunity of emerging from it; this would only be an accusation against nature, and not against the being which she had thus unhappily constituted. But as I understand the word miserable, it either has no meaning at all, or else signifies only a painful privation of something, or a state of suffering either in body or soul. I should be glad to have explained to me, what kind of misery a free being, whose heart is at ease and whose body is in health, can possibly suffer. I would ask also, whether a social or a natural life is most likely to become insupportable to those who enjoy it. We see around us hardly a creature in civil society, who does not lament his existence: we even see many deprive themselves of as much of it as they can, and laws human and divine together can hardly put a stop to the disorder. I ask, if it was ever known that a savage took it into his head, when at liberty, to complain of life or to make away with himself. Let us therefore judge, with less vanity, on which side the real misery is found. On the other hand, nothing could be more unhappy than savage man, dazzled by science, tormented by his passions, and reasoning about a state different from his own. It appears that Providence most wisely determined that the faculties, which he potentially possessed, should develop themselves only as occasion offered to exercise them, in order that they might not be superfluous or perplexing to him, by appearing before their time, nor slow and useless when the need for them arose. In instinct alone, he had all he required for living in the state of nature; and with a developed understanding he has only just enough to support life in society.

It appears, at first view, that men in a state of nature, having no moral relations or determinate obligations one with another, could not be either good or bad, virtuous or vicious; unless we take these terms in a physical sense, and call, in an individual, those qualities vices which may be injurious to his preservation, and those virtues which contribute to it; in which case, he would have to be accounted most virtuous, who put least check on the pure impulses of nature. But without deviating from the ordinary sense of the words, it will be proper to suspend the judgment we might be led to form on such a state, and be on our guard against our prejudices, till we have weighed the matter in the scales of impartiality, and seen whether virtues or vices preponderate among civilised men; and whether their virtues do them more good than their vices do harm; till we have discovered, whether the progress of the sciences sufficiently indemnifies them for the mischiefs they do one another, in proportion as they are better informed of the good they ought to do; or whether they would not be, on the whole, in a much happier condition if they had nothing to fear or to hope from any one, than as they are, subjected to universal dependence, and obliged to take everything from those who engage to give them nothing in return.

Above all, let us not conclude, with Hobbes, that because man has no idea of goodness, he must be naturally wicked; that he is vicious because he does not know virtue; that he always refuses to do his fellow-creatures services which he does not think they have a right to demand; or that by virtue of the right he truly claims to everything he needs, he foolishly imagines himself the sole proprietor of the whole universe. Hobbes had seen clearly the defects of all the modern definitions of natural right: but the consequences which he deduces from his own show that he understands it in an equally false sense. In reasoning on the principles he lays down, he ought to have said that the state of nature, being that in which the care for our own preservation is the least prejudicial to that of others, was consequently the best calculated to promote peace, and the most suitable for mankind. He does say the exact opposite, in consequence of having improperly admitted, as a part of savage man's care for self-preservation, the gratification of a multitude of passions which are the work of society, and have made laws necessary. A bad man, he says, is a robust child. But it remains to be proved whether man in a state of nature is this robust child; and, should we grant that he is, what would he infer? Why truly, that if this man, when robust and strong, were dependent on others as he is when feeble, there is no extravagance he would not be guilty of; that he would beat his mother when she was too slow in giving him her breast; that he would strangle one of his younger brothers, if he should be troublesome to him, or bite the arm of another, if he put him to any inconvenience. But that man in the state of nature is both strong and dependent involves two contrary suppositions. Man is weak when he is dependent, and is his own master before he comes to be strong. Hobbes did not reflect that the same cause, which prevents a savage from making use of his reason, as our jurists hold, prevents him also from abusing his faculties, as Hobbes himself allows; so that it may be justly said that savages are not bad merely because they do not know what it is to be good; for it is neither the development of the understanding nor the restraint of law that hinders them from doing ill; but the peacefulness of their passions, and their ignorance of vice; tanto plus in illis proficit vitiorum ignoratio, quam in his cognitio virtutis.(2)

There is another principle which has escaped Hobbes; which, having been bestowed on mankind, to moderate, on certain occasions, the impetuosity of egoism, or, before its birth, the desire of self-preservation, tempers the ardour with which he pursues his own welfare, by an innate repugnance at seeing a fellow-creature suffer.(3) I think I need not fear contradiction in holding man to be possessed of the only natural virtue, which could not be denied him by the most violent detractor of human virtue. I am speaking of compassion, which is a disposition suitable to creatures so weak and subject to so many evils as we certainly are; by so much the more universal and useful to mankind, as it comes before any kind of reflection; and at the same time so natural, that the very brutes themselves sometimes give evident proofs of it. Not to mention the tenderness of mothers for their offspring and the perils they encounter to save them from danger, it is well known that horses show a reluctance to trample on living bodies. One animal never passes by the dead body of another of its species; there are even some which give their fellows a sort of burial; while the mournful lowings of the cattle when they enter the slaughter-house show the impressions made on them by the horrible spectacle which meets them. We find, with pleasure, the author of the Fable of the Bees obliged to own that man is a compassionate and sensible being, and laying aside his cold subtlety of style, in the example he gives, to present us with the pathetic description of a man who, from a place of confinement, is compelled to behold a wild beast tear a child from the arms of its mother, grinding its tender limbs with its murderous teeth, and tearing its palpitating entrails with its claws. What horrid agitation must not the eyewitness of such a scene experience, although he would not be personally concerned! What anxiety would he not suffer at not being able to give any assistance to the fainting mother and the dying infant!

Such is the pure emotion of nature, prior to all kinds of reflection! Such is the force of natural compassion, which the greatest depravity of morals has as yet hardly been able to destroy! For we daily find at our theatres men affected, nay shedding tears at the sufferings of a wretch who, were he in the tyrant's place, would probably even add to the torments of his enemies; like the bloodthirsty Sulla, who was so sensitive to ills he had not caused, or that Alexander of Pheros who did not dare to go and see any tragedy acted, for fear of being seen weeping with Andromache and Priam, though he could listen without emotion to the cries of all the citizens who were daily strangled at his command.

Mollissima corda

Humano generi dare se natura fatetur,

Quoe lacrimas dedit.(4)

Mandeville well knew that, in spite of all their morality, men would have never been better than monsters, had not nature bestowed on them a sense of compassion, to aid their reason: but he did not see that from this quality alone flow all those social virtues, of which he denied man the possession. But what is generosity, clemency or humanity but compassion applied to the weak, to the guilty, or to mankind in general? Even benevolence and friendship are, if we judge rightly, only the effects of compassion, constantly set upon a particular object: for how is it different to wish that another person may not suffer pain and uneasiness and to wish him happy? Were it even true that pity is no more than a feeling, which puts us in the place of the sufferer, a feeling, obscure yet lively in a savage, developed yet feeble in civilised man; this truth would have no other consequence than to confirm my argument.

Compassion must, in fact, be the stronger, the more the animal beholding any kind of distress identifies himself with the animal that suffers. Now, it is plain that such identification must have been much more perfect in a state of nature than it is in a state of reason. It is reason that engenders self-respect, and reflection that confirms it: it is reason which turns man's mind back upon itself, and divides him from everything that could disturb or afflict him. It is philosophy that isolates him, and bids him say, at sight of the misfortunes of others: “Perish if you will, I am secure.” Nothing but such general evils as threaten the whole community can disturb the tranquil sleep of the philosopher, or tear him from his bed. A murder may with impunity be committed under his window; he has only to put his hands to his ears and argue a little with himself, to prevent nature, which is shocked within him, from identifying itself with the unfortunate sufferer. Uncivilised man has not this admirable talent; and for want of reason and wisdom, is always foolishly ready to obey the first promptings of humanity. It is the populace that flocks together at riots and street-brawls, while the wise man prudently makes off. It is the mob and the market-women, who part the combatants, and hinder gentle-folks from cutting one another's throats.

It is then certain that compassion is a natural feeling, which, by moderating the violence of love of self in each individual, contributes to the preservation of the whole species. It is this compassion that hurries us without reflection to the relief of those who are in distress; it is this which in a state of nature supplies the place of laws, morals and virtues, with the advantage that none are tempted to disobey its gentle voice; it is this which will always prevent a sturdy savage from robbing a weak child or a feeble old man of the sustenance they may have with pain and difficulty acquired, if he sees a possibility of providing for himself by other means; it is this which, instead of inculcating that sublime maxim of rational justice, “Do to others as you would have them do unto you”, inspires all men with that other maxim of natural goodness, much less perfect indeed, but perhaps more useful, “Do good to yourself with as little evil as possible to others”. In a word, it is rather in this natural feeling than in any subtle arguments that we must look for the cause of that repugnance, which every man would experience in doing evil, even independently of the maxims of education. Although it might belong to Socrates and other minds of the like craft to acquire virtue by reason, the human race would long since have ceased to be, had its preservation depended only on the reasonings of the individuals composing it.

With passions so little active, and so good a curb, men, being rather wild than wicked, and more intent to guard themselves against the mischief that might be done them, than to do mischief to others, were by no means subject to very perilous dissensions. They maintained no kind of intercourse with one another, and were consequently strangers to vanity, deference, esteem and contempt; they had not the least idea of meum and tuum, and no true conception of justice; they looked upon every violence to which they were subjected, rather as an injury that might easily be repaired than as a crime that ought to be punished; and they never thought of taking revenge, unless perhaps mechanically and on the spot, as a dog will sometimes bite the stone which is thrown at him. Their quarrels therefore would seldom have very bloody consequences; for the subject of them would be merely the question of subsistence. But I am aware of one greater danger, which remains to be noticed.

Of the passions that stir the heart of man, there is one which makes the sexes necessary to each other, and is extremely ardent and impetuous; a terrible passion that braves danger, surmounts all obstacles, and in its transports seems calculated to bring destruction on the human race which it is really destined to preserve. What must become of men who are left to this brutal and boundless rage, without modesty, without shame, and daily upholding their amours at the price of their blood?

It must, in the first place, be allowed that, the more violent the passions are, the more are laws necessary to keep them under restraint. But, setting aside the inadequacy of laws to effect this purpose, which is evident from the crimes and disorders to which these passions daily give rise among us, we should do well to inquire if these evils did not spring up with the laws themselves; for in this case, even if the laws were capable of repressing such evils, it is the least that could be expected from them, that they should check a mischief which would not have arisen without them.

Let us begin by distinguishing between the physical and moral ingredients in the feeling of love. The physical part of love is that general desire which urges the sexes to union with each other. The moral part is that which determines and fixes this desire exclusively upon one particular object; or at least gives it a greater degree of energy toward the object thus preferred. It is easy to see that the moral part of love is a factitious feeling, born of social usage, and enhanced by the women with much care and cleverness, to establish their empire, and put in power the sex which ought to obey. This feeling, being founded on certain ideas of beauty and merit which a savage is not in a position to acquire, and on comparisons which he is incapable of making, must be for him almost non-existent; for, as his mind cannot form abstract ideas of proportion and regularity, so his heart is not susceptible of the feelings of love and admiration, which are even insensibly produced by the application of these ideas. He follows solely the character nature has implanted in him, and not tastes which he could never have acquired; so that every woman equally answers his purpose.

Men in a state of nature being confined merely to what is physical in love, and fortunate enough to be ignorant of those excellences, which whet the appetite while they increase the difficulty of gratifying it, must be subject to fewer and less violent fits of passion, and consequently fall into fewer and less violent disputes. The imagination, which causes such ravages among us, never speaks to the heart of savages, who quietly await the impulses of nature, yield to them involuntarily, with more pleasure than ardour, and, their wants once satisfied, lose the desire. It is therefore incontestable that love, as well as all other passions, must have acquired in society that glowing impetuosity, which makes it so often fatal to mankind. And it is the more absurd to represent savages as continually cutting one another's throats to indulge their brutality, because this opinion is directly contrary to experience; the Caribbeans, who have as yet least of all deviated from the state of nature, being in fact the most peaceable of people in their amours, and the least subject to jealousy, though they live in a hot climate which seems always to inflame the passions.

With regard to the inferences that might be drawn, in the case of several species of animals, the males of which fill our poultry-yards with blood and slaughter, or in spring make the forests resound with their quarrels over their females; we must begin by excluding all those species, in which nature has plainly established, in the comparative power of the sexes, relations different from those which exist among us; thus we can base no conclusion about men on the habits of fighting cocks. In those species where the proportion is better observed, these battles must be entirely due to the scarcity of females in comparison with males; or, what amounts to the same thing, to the intervals during which the female constantly refuses the advances of the male; for if each female admits the male but during two months in the year, it is the same as if the number of females were five-sixths less. Now, neither of these two cases is applicable to the human species, in which the number of females usually exceeds that of males, and among whom it has never been observed, even among savages, that the females have, like those of other animals, their stated times of passion and indifference. Moreover, in several of these species, the individuals all take fire at once, and there comes a fearful moment of universal passion, tumult and disorder among them; a scene which is never beheld in the human species, whose love is not thus seasonal. We must not then conclude from the combats of such animals for the enjoyment of the females, that the case would be the same with mankind in a state of nature; and, even if we drew such a conclusion, we see that such contests do not exterminate other kinds of animals, and we have no reason to think they would be more fatal to ours. It is indeed clear that they would do still less mischief than is the case in a state of society; especially in those countries in which, morals being still held in some repute, the jealousy of lovers and the vengeance of husbands are the daily cause of duels, murders, and even worse crimes; where the obligation of eternal fidelity only occasions adultery, and the very laws of honour and continence necessarily increase debauchery and lead to the multiplication of abortions.

Let us conclude then that man in a state of nature, wandering up and down the forests, without industry, without speech, and without home, an equal stranger to war and to all ties, neither standing in need of his fellow-creatures nor having any desire to hurt them, and perhaps even not distinguishing them one from another; let us conclude that, being self-sufficient and subject to so few passions, he could have no feelings or knowledge but such as befitted his situation; that he felt only his actual necessities, and disregarded everything he did not think himself immediately concerned to notice, and that his understanding made no greater progress than his vanity. If by accident he made any discovery, he was the less able to communicate it to others, as he did not know even his own children. Every art would necessarily perish with its inventor, where there was no kind of education among men, and generations succeeded generations without the least advance; when, all setting out from the same point, centuries must have elapsed in the barbarism of the first ages; when the race was already old, and man remained a child.

If I have expatiated at such length on this supposed primitive state, it is because I had so many ancient errors and inveterate prejudices to eradicate, and therefore thought it incumbent on me to dig down to their very root, and show, by means of a true picture of the state of nature, how far even the natural inequalities of mankind are from having that reality and influence which modern writers suppose.

It is in fact easy to see that many of the differences which distinguish men are merely the effect of habit and the different methods of life men adopt in society. Thus a robust or delicate constitution, and the strength or weakness attaching to it, are more frequently the effects of a hardy or effeminate method of education than of the original endowment of the body. It is the same with the powers of the mind; for education not only makes a difference between such as are cultured and such as are not, but even increases the differences which exist among the former, in proportion to their respective degrees of culture; as the distance between a giant and a dwarf on the same road increases with every step they take. If we compare the prodigious diversity, which obtains in the education and manner of life of the various orders of men in the state of society, with the uniformity and simplicity of animal and savage life, in which every one lives on the same kind of food and in exactly the same manner, and does exactly the same things, it is easy to conceive how much less the difference between man and man must be in a state of nature than in a state of society, and how greatly the natural inequality of mankind must be increased by the inequalities of social institutions.

But even if nature really affected, in the distribution of her gifts, that partiality which is imputed to her, what advantage would the greatest of her favourites derive from it, to the detriment of others, in a state that admits of hardly any kind of relation between them? Where there is no love, of what advantage is beauty? Of what use is wit to those who do not converse, or cunning to those who have no business with others? I hear it constantly repeated that, in such a state, the strong would oppress the weak; but what is here meant by oppression? Some, it is said, would violently domineer over others, who would groan under a servile submission to their caprices. This indeed is exactly what I observe to be the case among us; but I do not see how it can be inferred of men in a state of nature, who could not easily be brought to conceive what we mean by dominion and servitude. One man, it is true, might seize the fruits which another had gathered, the game he had killed, or the cave he had chosen for shelter; but how would he ever be able to exact obedience, and what ties of dependence could there be among men without possessions? If, for instance, I am driven from one tree, I can go to the next; if I am disturbed in one place, what hinders me from going to another? Again, should I happen to meet with a man so much stronger than myself, and at the same time so depraved, so indolent, and so barbarous, as to compel me to provide for his sustenance while he himself remains idle; he must take care not to have his eyes off me for a single moment; he must bind me fast before he goes to sleep, or I shall certainly either knock him on the head or make my escape. That is to say, he must in such a case voluntarily expose himself to much greater trouble than he seeks to avoid, or can give me. After all this, let him be off his guard ever so little; let him but turn his head aside at any sudden noise, and I shall be instantly twenty paces off, lost in the forest, and, my fetters burst asunder, he would never see me again.

Without my expatiating thus uselessly on these details, every one must see that as the bonds of servitude are formed merely by the mutual dependence of men on one another and the reciprocal needs that unite them, it is impossible to make any man a slave, unless he be first reduced to a situation in which he cannot do without the help of others; and, since such a situation does not exist in a state of nature, every one is there his own master, and the law of the strongest is of no effect.

Having proved that the inequality of mankind is hardly felt, and that its influence is next to nothing in a state of nature, I must next show its origin and trace its progress in the successive developments of the human mind. Having shown that human perfectibility, the social virtues, and the other faculties which natural man potentially possessed, could never develop of themselves, but must require the fortuitous concurrence of many foreign causes that might never arise, and without which he would have remained for ever in his primitive condition, I must now collect and consider the different accidents which may have improved the human understanding while depraving the species, and made man wicked while making him sociable; so as to bring him and the world from that distant period to the point at which we now behold them.

I confess that, as the events I am going to describe might have happened in various ways, I have nothing to determine my choice but conjectures; but such conjectures become reasons, when they are the most probable that can be drawn from the nature of things, and the only means of discovering the truth. The consequences, however, which I mean to deduce will not be barely conjectural; as, on the principles just laid down, it would be impossible to form any other theory that would not furnish the same results, and from which I could not draw the same conclusions.

This will be a sufficient apology for my not dwelling on the manner in which the lapse of time compensates for the little probability in the events; on the surprising power of trivial causes, when their action is constant; on the impossibility, on the one hand, of destroying certain hypotheses, though on the other we cannot give them the certainty of known matters of fact; on its being within the province of history, when two facts are given as real, and have to be connected by a series of intermediate facts, which are unknown or supposed to be so, to supply such facts as may connect them; and on its being in the province of philosophy when history is silent, to determine similar facts to serve the same end; and lastly, on the influence of similarity, which, in the case of events, reduces the facts to a much smaller number of different classes than is commonly imagined. It is enough for me to offer these hints to the consideration of my judges, and to have so arranged that the general reader has no need to consider them at all.

(3) Egoism must not be confused with self-respect: for they differ both in themselves and in their effects. Self-respect is a natural feeling which leads every animal to look to its own preservation, and which, guided in man by reason and modified by compassion, creates humanity and virtue. Egoism is a purely relative and factitious feeling, which arises in the state of society, leads each individual to make more of himself than of any other, causes all the mutual damage men inflict one on another, and is the real source of the “sense of honour.” This being understood, I maintain that, in our primitive condition, in the true state of nature, egoism did not exist; for as each man regarded himself as the only observer of his actions, the only being in the universe who took any interest in him, and the sole judge of his deserts, no feeling arising from comparisons he could not be led to make could take root in his soul; and for the same reason, he could know neither hatred nor the desire for revenge, since these passions can spring only from a sense of injury: and as it is the contempt or the intention to hurt, and not the harm done, which constitutes the injury, men who neither valued nor compared themselves could do one another much violence, when it suited them, without feeling any sense of injury. In a word, each man, regarding his fellows almost as he regarded animals of different species, might seize the prey of a weaker or yield up his own to a stronger, and yet consider these acts of violence as mere natural occurrences, without the slightest emotion of insolence or despite, or any other feeling than the joy or grief of success or failure.

The Second Part


THE first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying “This is mine”, and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows, “Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.” But there is great probability that things had then already come to such a pitch, that they could no longer continue as they were; for the idea of property depends on many prior ideas, which could only be acquired successively, and cannot have been formed all at once in the human mind. Mankind must have made very considerable progress, and acquired considerable knowledge and industry which they must also have transmitted and increased from age to age, before they arrived at this last point of the state of nature. Let us then go farther back, and endeavour to unify under a single point of view that slow succession of events and discoveries in the most natural order.

Man's first feeling was that of his own existence, and his first care that of self-preservation. The produce of the earth furnished him with all he needed, and instinct told him how to use it. Hunger and other appetites made him at various times experience various modes of existence; and among these was one which urged him to propagate his species — a blind propensity that, having nothing to do with the heart, produced a merely animal act. The want once gratified, the two sexes knew each other no more; and even the offspring was nothing to its mother, as soon as it could do without her.

Such was the condition of infant man; the life of an animal limited at first to mere sensations, and hardly profiting by the gifts nature bestowed on him, much less capable of entertaining a thought of forcing anything from her. But difficulties soon presented themselves, and it became necessary to learn how to surmount them: the height of the trees, which prevented him from gathering their fruits, the competition of other animals desirous of the same fruits, and the ferocity of those who needed them for their own preservation, all obliged him to apply himself to bodily exercises. He had to be active, swift of foot, and vigorous in fight. Natural weapons, stones and sticks, were easily found; he learnt to surmount the obstacles of nature, to contend in case of necessity with other animals, and to dispute for the means of subsistence even with other men, or to indemnify himself for what he was forced to give up to a stronger.

In proportion as the human race grew more numerous, men's cares increased. The difference of soils, climates and seasons, must have introduced some differences into their manner of living. Barren years, long and sharp winters, scorching summers which parched the fruits of the earth, must have demanded a new industry. On the seashore and the banks of rivers, they invented the hook and line, and became fishermen and eaters of fish. In the forests they made bows and arrows, and became huntsmen and warriors. In cold countries they clothed themselves with the skins of the beasts they had slain. The lightning, a volcano, or some lucky chance acquainted them with fire, a new resource against the rigours of winter; they next learned how to preserve this element, then how to reproduce it, and finally how to prepare with it the flesh of animals which before they had eaten raw.

This repeated relevance of various beings to himself, and one to another, would naturally give rise in the human mind to the perceptions of certain relations between them. Thus the relations which we denote by the terms, great, small, strong, weak, swift, slow, fearful, bold, and the like, almost insensibly compared at need, must have at length produced in him a kind of reflection, or rather a mechanical prudence, which would indicate to him the precautions most necessary to his security.

The new intelligence which resulted from this development increased his superiority over other animals, by making him sensible of it. He would now endeavour, therefore, to ensnare them, would play them a thousand tricks, and though many of them might surpass him in swiftness or in strength, would in time become the master of some and the scourge of others. Thus, the first time he looked into himself, he felt the first emotion of pride; and, at a time when he scarce knew how to distinguish the different orders of beings, by looking upon his species as of the highest order, he prepared the way for assuming pre-eminence as an individual.

Other men, it is true, were not then to him what they now are to us, and he had no greater intercourse with them than with other animals; yet they were not neglected in his observations. The conformities, which he would in time discover between them, and between himself and his female, led him to judge of others which were not then perceptible; and finding that they all behaved as he himself would have done in like circumstances, he naturally inferred that their manner of thinking and acting was altogether in conformity with his own. This important truth, once deeply impressed on his mind, must have induced him, from an intuitive feeling more certain and much more rapid than any kind of reasoning, to pursue the rules of conduct, which he had best observe towards them, for his own security and advantage.

Taught by experience that the love of well-being is the sole motive of human actions, he found himself in a position to distinguish the few cases, in which mutual interest might justify him in relying upon the assistance of his fellows; and also the still fewer cases in which a conflict of interests might give cause to suspect them. In the former case, he joined in the same herd with them, or at most in some kind of loose association, that laid no restraint on its members, and lasted no longer than the transitory occasion that formed it. In the latter case, every one sought his own private advantage, either by open force, if he thought himself strong enough, or by address and cunning, if he felt himself the weaker.

In this manner, men may have insensibly acquired some gross ideas of mutual undertakings, and of the advantages of fulfilling them: that is, just so far as their present and apparent interest was concerned; for they were perfect strangers to foresight, and were so far from troubling themselves about the distant future, that they hardly thought of the morrow. If a deer was to be taken, every one saw that, in order to succeed, he must abide faithfully by his post; but if a hare happened to come within the reach of any one of them, it is not to be doubted that he pursued it without scruple, and, having seized his prey, cared very little, if by so doing he caused his companions to miss theirs.

It is easy to understand that such intercourse would not require a language much more refined than that of rooks or monkeys, who associate together for much the same purpose. Inarticulate cries, plenty of gestures and some imitative sounds, must have been for a long time the universal language; and by the addition, in every country, of some conventional articulate sounds (of which, as I have already intimated, the first institution is not too easy to explain) particular languages were produced; but these were rude and imperfect, and nearly such as are now to be found among some savage nations.

Hurried on by the rapidity of time, by the abundance of things I have to say, and by the almost insensible progress of things in their beginnings, I pass over in an instant a multitude of ages; for the slower the events were in their succession, the more rapidly may they be described.

These first advances enabled men to make others with greater rapidity. In proportion as they grew enlightened, they grew industrious. They ceased to fall asleep under the first tree, or in the first cave that afforded them shelter; they invented several kinds of implements of hard and sharp stones, which they used to dig up the earth, and to cut wood; they then made huts out of branches, and afterwards learnt to plaster them over with mud and clay. This was the epoch of a first revolution, which established and distinguished families, and introduced a kind of property, in itself the source of a thousand quarrels and conflicts. As, however, the strongest were probably the first to build themselves huts which they felt themselves able to defend, it may be concluded that the weak found it much easier and safer to imitate, than to attempt to dislodge them; and of those who were once provided with huts, none could have any inducement to appropriate that of his neighbour; not indeed so much because it did not belong to him, as because it could be of no use, and he could not make himself master of it without exposing himself to a desperate battle with the family which occupied it.

The first expansions of the human heart were the effects of a novel situation, which united husbands and wives, fathers and children, under one roof. The habit of living together soon gave rise to the finest feelings known to humanity, conjugal love and paternal affection. Every family became a little society, the more united because liberty and reciprocal attachment were the only bonds of its union. The sexes, whose manner of life had been hitherto the same, began now to adopt different ways of living. The women became more sedentary, and accustomed themselves to mind the hut and their children, while the men went abroad in search of their common subsistence. From living a softer life, both sexes also began to lose something of their strength and ferocity; but, if individuals became to some extent less able to encounter wild beasts separately, they found it, on the other hand, easier to assemble and resist in common.

The simplicity and solitude of man's life in this new condition, the paucity of his wants, and the implements he had invented to satisfy them, left him a great deal of leisure, which he employed to furnish himself with many conveniences unknown to his fathers: and this was the first yoke he inadvertently imposed on himself, and the first source of the evils he prepared for his descendants. For, besides continuing thus to enervate both body and mind, these conveniences lost with use almost all their power to please, and even degenerated into real needs, till the want of them became far more disagreeable than the possession of them had been pleasant. Men would have been unhappy at the loss of them, though the possession did not make them happy.

We can here see a little better how the use of speech became established, and insensibly improved in each family, and we may form a conjecture also concerning the manner in which various causes may have extended and accelerated the progress of language, by making it more and more necessary. Floods or earthquakes surrounded inhabited districts with precipices or waters; revolutions of the globe tore off portions from the continent, and made them islands. It is readily seen that among men thus collected and compelled to live together, a common idiom must have arisen much more easily than among those who still wandered through the forests of the continent. Thus it is very possible that after their first essays in navigation the islanders brought over the use of speech to the continent; and it is at least very probable that communities and languages were first established in islands, and even came to perfection there before they were known on the mainland.

Everything now begins to change its aspect. Men, who have up to now been roving in the woods, by taking to a more settled manner of life, come gradually together, form separate bodies, and at length in every country arises a distinct nation, united in character and manners, not by regulations or laws, but by uniformity of life and food, and the common influence of climate. Permanent neighbourhood could not fail to produce, in time, some connection between different families. Among young people of opposite sexes, living in neighbouring huts, the transient commerce required by nature soon led, through mutual intercourse, to another kind not less agreeable, and more permanent. Men began now to take the difference between objects into account, and to make comparisons; they acquired imperceptibly the ideas of beauty and merit, which soon gave rise to feelings of preference. In consequence of seeing each other often, they could not do without seeing each other constantly. A tender and pleasant feeling insinuated itself into their souls, and the least opposition turned it into an impetuous fury: with love arose jealousy; discord triumphed, and human blood was sacrificed to the gentlest of all passions.

As ideas and feelings succeeded one another, and heart and head were brought into play, men continued to lay aside their original wildness; their private connections became every day more intimate as their limits extended. They accustomed themselves to assemble before their huts round a large tree; singing and dancing, the true offspring of love and leisure, became the amusement, or rather the occupation, of men and women thus assembled together with nothing else to do. Each one began to consider the rest, and to wish to be considered in turn; and thus a value came to be attached to public esteem. Whoever sang or danced best, whoever was the handsomest, the strongest, the most dexterous, or the most eloquent, came to be of most consideration; and this was the first step towards inequality, and at the same time towards vice. From these first distinctions arose on the one side vanity and contempt and on the other shame and envy; and the fermentation caused by these new leavens ended by producing combinations fatal to innocence and happiness.

As soon as men began to value one another, and the idea of consideration had got a footing in the mind, every one put in his claim to it, and it became impossible to refuse it to any with impunity. Hence arose the first obligations of civility even among savages; and every intended injury became an affront; because, besides the hurt which might result from it, the party injured was certain to find in it a contempt for his person, which was often more insupportable than the hurt itself.

Thus, as every man punished the contempt shown him by others, in proportion to his opinion of himself, revenge became terrible, and men bloody and cruel. This is precisely the state reached by most of the savage nations known to us; and it is for want of having made a proper distinction in our ideas, and see how very far they already are from the state of nature, that so many writers have hastily concluded that man is naturally cruel, and requires civil institutions to make him more mild; whereas nothing is more gentle than man in his primitive state, as he is placed by nature at an equal distance from the stupidity of brutes, and the fatal ingenuity of civilised man. Equally confined by instinct and reason to the sole care of guarding himself against the mischiefs which threaten him, he is restrained by natural compassion from doing any injury to others, and is not led to do such a thing even in return for injuries received. For, according to the axiom of the wise Locke, “There can be no injury, where there is no property.”

But it must be remarked that the society thus formed, and the relations thus established among men, required of them qualities different from those which they possessed from their primitive constitution. Morality began to appear in human actions, and every one, before the institution of law, was the only judge and avenger of the injuries done him, so that the goodness which was suitable in the pure state of nature was no longer proper in the new-born state of society. Punishments had to be made more severe, as opportunities of offending became more frequent, and the dread of vengeance had to take the place of the rigour of the law. Thus, though men had become less patient, and their natural compassion had already suffered some diminution, this period of expansion of the human faculties, keeping a just mean between the indolence of the primitive state and the petulant activity of our egoism, must have been the happiest and most stable of epochs. The more we reflect on it, the more we shall find that this state was the least subject to revolutions, and altogether the very best man could experience; so that he can have departed from it only through some fatal accident, which, for the public good, should never have happened. The example of savages, most of whom have been found in this state, seems to prove that men were meant to remain in it, that it is the real youth of the world, and that all subsequent advances have been apparently so many steps towards the perfection of the individual, but in reality towards the decrepitude of the species.

So long as men remained content with their rustic huts, so long as they were satisfied with clothes made of the skins of animals and sewn together with thorns and fish-bones, adorned themselves only with feathers and shells, and continued to paint their bodies different colours, to improve and beautify their bows and arrows and to make with sharp-edged stones fishing boats or clumsy musical instruments; in a word, so long as they undertook only what a single person could accomplish, and confined themselves to such arts as did not require the joint labour of several hands, they lived free, healthy, honest and happy lives, so long as their nature allowed, and as they continued to enjoy the pleasures of mutual and independent intercourse. But from the moment one man began to stand in need of the help of another; from the moment it appeared advantageous to any one man to have enough provisions for two, equality disappeared, property was introduced, work became indispensable, and vast forests became smiling fields, which man had to water with the sweat of his brow, and where slavery and misery were soon seen to germinate and grow up with the crops.

Metallurgy and agriculture were the two arts which produced this great revolution. The poets tell us it was gold and silver, but, for the philosophers, it was iron and corn, which first civilised men, and ruined humanity. Thus both were unknown to the savages of America, who for that reason are still savage; the other nations also seem to have continued in a state of barbarism while they practised only one of these arts. One of the best reasons, perhaps, why Europe has been, if not longer, at least more constantly and highly civilised than the rest of the world, is that it is at once the most abundant in iron and the most fertile in corn.

It is difficult to conjecture how men first came to know and use iron; for it is impossible to suppose they would of themselves think of digging the ore out of the mine, and preparing it for smelting, before they knew what would be the result. On the other hand, we have the less reason to suppose this discovery the effect of any accidental fire, as mines are only formed in barren places, bare of trees and plants; so that it looks as if nature had taken pains to keep that fatal secret from us. There remains, therefore, only the extraordinary accident of some volcano which, by ejecting metallic substances already in fusion, suggested to the spectators the idea of imitating the natural operation. And we must further conceive them as possessed of uncommon courage and foresight, to undertake so laborious a work, with so distant a prospect of drawing advantage from it; yet these qualities are united only in minds more advanced than we can suppose those of these first discoverers to have been.

With regard to agriculture, the principles of it were known long before they were put in practice; and it is indeed hardly possible that men, constantly employed in drawing their subsistence from plants and trees, should not readily acquire a knowledge of the means made use of by nature for the propagation of vegetables. It was in all probability very long, however, before their industry took that turn, either because trees, which together with hunting and fishing afforded them food, did not require their attention; or because they were ignorant of the use of corn, or without instruments to cultivate it; or because they lacked foresight to future needs; or lastily, because they were without means of preventing others from robbing them of the fruit of their labour.

When they grew more industrious, it is natural to believe that they began, with the help of sharp stones and pointed sticks, to cultivate a few vegetables or roots around their huts; though it was long before they knew how to prepare corn, or were provided with the implements necessary for raising it in any large quantity; not to mention how essential it is, for husbandry, to consent to immediate loss, in order to reap a future gain — a precaution very foreign to the turn of a savage's mind; for, as I have said, he hardly foresees in the morning what he will need at night.

The invention of the other arts must therefore have been necessary to compel mankind to apply themselves to agriculture. No sooner were artificers wanted to smelt and forge iron, than others were required to maintain them; the more hands that were employed in manufactures, the fewer were left to provide for the common subsistence, though the number of mouths to be furnished with food remained the same; and as some required commodities in exchange for their iron, the rest at length discovered the method of making iron serve for the multiplication of commodities. By this means the arts of husbandry and agriculture were established on the one hand, and the art of working metals and multiplying their uses on the other.

The cultivation of the earth necessarily brought about its distribution; and property, once recognised, gave rise to the first rules of justice; for, to secure each man his own, it had to be possible for each to have something. Besides, as men began to look forward to the future, and all had something to lose, every one had reason to apprehend that reprisals would follow any injury he might do to another. This origin is so much the more natural, as it is impossible to conceive how property can come from anything but manual labour: for what else can a man add to things which he does not originally create, so as to make them his own property? It is the husbandman's labour alone that, giving him a title to the produce of the ground he has tilled, gives him a claim also to the land itself, at least till harvest, and so, from year to year, a constant possession which is easily transformed into property. When the ancients, says Grotius, gave to Ceres the title of Legislatrix, and to a festival celebrated in her honour the name of Thesmophoria, they meant by that that the distribution of lands had produced a new kind of right: that is to say, the right of property, which is different from the right deducible from the law of nature.

In this state of affairs, equality might have been sustained, had the talents of individuals been equal, and had, for example, the use of iron and the consumption of commodities always exactly balanced each other; but, as there was nothing to preserve this balance, it was soon disturbed; the strongest did most work; the most skilful turned his labour to best account; the most ingenious devised methods of diminishing his labour: the husbandman wanted more iron, or the smith more corn, and, while both laboured equally, the one gained a great deal by his work, while the other could hardly support himself. Thus natural inequality unfolds itself insensibly with that of combination, and the difference between men, developed by their different circumstances, becomes more sensible and permanent in its effects, and begins to have an influence, in the same proportion, over the lot of individuals.

Matters once at this pitch, it is easy to imagine the rest. I shall not detain the reader with a description of the successive invention of other arts, the development of language, the trial and utilisation of talents, the inequality of fortunes, the use and abuse of riches, and all the details connected with them which the reader can easily supply for himself. I shall confine myself to a glance at mankind in this new situation.

Behold then all human faculties developed, memory and imagination in full play, egoism interested, reason active, and the mind almost at the highest point of its perfection. Behold all the natural qualities in action, the rank and condition of every man assigned him; not merely his share of property and his power to serve or injure others, but also his wit, beauty, strength or skill, merit or talents; and these being the only qualities capable of commanding respect, it soon became necessary to possess or to affect them.

It now became the interest of men to appear what they really were not. To be and to seem became two totally different things; and from this distinction sprang insolent pomp and cheating trickery, with all the numerous vices that go in their train. On the other hand, free and independent as men were before, they were now, in consequence of a multiplicity of new wants, brought into subjection, as it were, to all nature, and particularly to one another; and each became in some degree a slave even in becoming the master of other men: if rich, they stood in need of the services of others; if poor, of their assistance; and even a middle condition did not enable them to do without one another. Man must now, therefore, have been perpetually employed in getting others to interest themselves in his lot, and in making them, apparently at least, if not really, find their advantage in promoting his own. Thus he must have been sly and artful in his behaviour to some, and imperious and cruel to others; being under a kind of necessity to ill-use all the persons of whom he stood in need, when he could not frighten them into compliance, and did not judge it his interest to be useful to them. Insatiable ambition, the thirst of raising their respective fortunes, not so much from real want as from the desire to surpass others, inspired all men with a vile propensity to injure one another, and with a secret jealousy, which is the more dangerous, as it puts on the mask of benevolence, to carry its point with greater security. In a word, there arose rivalry and competition on the one hand, and conflicting interests on the other, together with a secret desire on both of profiting at the expense of others. All these evils were the first effects of property, and the inseparable attendants of growing inequality.

Before the invention of signs to represent riches, wealth could hardly consist in anything but lands and cattle, the only real possessions men can have. But, when inheritances so increased in number and extent as to occupy the whole of the land, and to border on one another, one man could aggrandise himself only at the expense of another; at the same time the supernumeraries, who had been too weak or too indolent to make such acquisitions, and had grown poor without sustaining any loss, because, while they saw everything change around them, they remained still the same, were obliged to receive their subsistence, or steal it, from the rich; and this soon bred, according to their different characters, dominion and slavery, or violence and rapine. The wealthy, on their part, had no sooner begun to taste the pleasure of command, than they disdained all others, and, using their old slaves to acquire new, thought of nothing but subduing and enslaving their neighbours; like ravenous wolves, which, having once tasted human flesh, despise every other food and thenceforth seek only men to devour.

Thus, as the most powerful or the most miserable considered their might or misery as a kind of right to the possessions of others, equivalent, in their opinion, to that of property, the destruction of equality was attended by the most terrible disorders. Usurpations by the rich, robbery by the poor, and the unbridled passions of both, suppressed the cries of natural compassion and the still feeble voice of justice, and filled men with avarice, ambition and vice. Between the title of the strongest and that of the first occupier, there arose perpetual conflicts, which never ended but in battles and bloodshed. The new-born state of society thus gave rise to a horrible state of war; men thus harassed and depraved were no longer capable of retracing their steps or renouncing the fatal acquisitions they had made, but, labouring by the abuse of the faculties which do them honour, merely to their own confusion, brought themselves to the brink of ruin.

Attonitus novitate mali, divesque miserque,

Effugere optat opes; et quæ modo voverat odit.(1)

It is impossible that men should not at length have reflected on so wretched a situation, and on the calamities that overwhelmed them. The rich, in particular, must have felt how much they suffered by a constant state of war, of which they bore all the expense; and in which, though all risked their lives, they alone risked their property. Besides, however speciously they might disguise their usurpations, they knew that they were founded on precarious and false titles; so that, if others took from them by force what they themselves had gained by force, they would have no reason to complain. Even those who had been enriched by their own industry, could hardly base their proprietorship on better claims. It was in vain to repeat, “I built this wall; I gained this spot by my industry.” Who gave you your standing, it might be answered, and what right have you to demand payment of us for doing what we never asked you to do? Do you not know that numbers of your fellow-creatures are starving, for want of what you have too much of? You ought to have had the express and universal consent of mankind, before appropriating more of the common subsistence than you needed for your own maintenance. Destitute of valid reasons to justify and sufficient strength to defend himself, able to crush individuals with ease, but easily crushed himself by a troop of bandits, one against all, and incapable, on account of mutual jealousy, of joining with his equals against numerous enemies united by the common hope of plunder, the rich man, thus urged by necessity, conceived at length the profoundest plan that ever entered the mind of man: this was to employ in his favour the forces of those who attacked him, to make allies of his adversaries, to inspire them with different maxims, and to give them other institutions as favourable to himself as the law of nature was unfavourable.

With this view, after having represented to his neighbours the horror of a situation which armed every man against the rest, and made their possessions as burdensome to them as their wants, and in which no safety could be expected either in riches or in poverty, he readily devised plausible arguments to make them close with his design. “Let us join,” said he, “to guard the weak from oppression, to restrain the ambitious, and secure to every man the possession of what belongs to him; let us institute rules of justice and peace, to which all without exception may be obliged to conform; rules that may in some measure make amends for the caprices of fortune, by subjecting equally the powerful and the weak to the observance of reciprocal obligations. Let us, in a word, instead of turning our forces against ourselves, collect them in a supreme power which may govern us by wise laws, protect and defend all the members of the association, repulse their common enemies, and maintain eternal harmony among us.”

Far fewer words to this purpose would have been enough to impose on men so barbarous and easily seduced; especially as they had too many disputes among themselves to do without arbitrators, and too much ambition and avarice to go long without masters. All ran headlong to their chains, in hopes of securing their liberty; for they had just wit enough to perceive the advantages of political institutions, without experience enough to enable them to foresee the dangers. The most capable of foreseeing the dangers were the very persons who expected to benefit by them; and even the most prudent judged it not inexpedient to sacrifice one part of their freedom to ensure the rest; as a wounded man has his arm cut off to save the rest of his body.

Such was, or may well have been, the origin of society and law, which bound new fetters on the poor, and gave new powers to the rich; which irretrievably destroyed natural liberty, eternally fixed the law of property and inequality, converted clever usurpation into unalterable right, and, for the advantage of a few ambitious individuals, subjected all mankind to perpetual labour, slavery and wretchedness. It is easy to see how the establishment of one community made that of all the rest necessary, and how, in order to make head against united forces, the rest of mankind had to unite in turn. Societies soon multiplied and spread over the face of the earth, till hardly a corner of the world was left in which a man could escape the yoke, and withdraw his head from beneath the sword which he saw perpetually hanging over him by a thread. Civil right having thus become the common rule among the members of each community, the law of nature maintained its place only between different communities, where, under the name of the right of nations, it was qualified by certain tacit conventions, in order to make commerce practicable, and serve as a substitute for natural compassion, which lost, when applied to societies, almost all the influence it had over individuals, and survived no longer except in some great cosmopolitan spirits, who, breaking down the imaginary barriers that separate different peoples, follow the example of our Sovereign Creator, and include the whole human race in their benevolence.

But bodies politic, remaining thus in a state of nature among themselves, presently experienced the inconveniences which had obliged individuals to forsake it; for this state became still more fatal to these great bodies than it had been to the individuals of whom they were composed. Hence arose national wars, battles, murders, and reprisals, which shock nature and outrage reason; together with all those horrible prejudices which class among the virtues the honour of shedding human blood. The most distinguished men hence learned to consider cutting each other's throats a duty; at length men massacred their fellow-creatures by thousands without so much as knowing why, and committed more murders in a single day's fighting, and more violent outrages in the sack of a single town, than were committed in the state of nature during whole ages over the whole earth. Such were the first effects which we can see to have followed the division of mankind into different communities. But let us return to their institutions.

I know that some writers have given other explanations of the origin of political societies, such as the conquest of the powerful, or the association of the weak. It is, indeed, indifferent to my argument which of these causes we choose. That which I have just laid down, however, appears to me the most natural for the following reasons. First: because, in the first case, the right of conquest, being no right in itself, could not serve as a foundation on which to build any other; the victor and the vanquished people still remained with respect to each other in the state of war, unless the vanquished, restored to the full possession of their liberty, voluntarily made choice of the victor for their chief. For till then, whatever capitulation may have been made being founded on violence, and therefore ipso facto void, there could not have been on this hypothesis either a real society or body politic, or any law other than that of the strongest. Secondly: because the words strong and weak are, in the second case, ambiguous; for during the interval between the establishment of a right of property, or prior occupancy, and that of political government, the meaning of these words is better expressed by the terms rich and poor; because, in fact, before the institution of laws, men had no other way of reducing their equals to submission, than by attacking their goods, or making some of their own over to them. Thirdly: because, as the poor had nothing but their freedom to lose, it would have been in the highest degree absurd for them to resign voluntarily the only good they still enjoyed, without getting anything in exchange; whereas the rich having feelings, if I may so express myself, in every part of their possessions, it was much easier to harm them, and therefore more necessary for them to take precautions against it; and, in short, because it is more reasonable to suppose a thing to have been invented by those to whom it would be of service, than by those whom it must have harmed.

Government had, in its infancy, no regular and constant form. The want of experience and philosophy prevented men from seeing any but present inconveniences, and they thought of providing against others only as they presented themselves. In spite of the endeavours of the wisest legislators, the political state remained imperfect, because it was little more than the work of chance; and, as it had begun ill, though time revealed its defects and suggested remedies, the original faults were never repaired. It was continually being patched up, when the first task should have been to get the site cleared and all the old materials removed, as was done by Lycurgus at Sparta, if a stable and lasting edifice was to be erected. Society consisted at first merely of a few general conventions, which every member bound himself to observe; and for the performance of covenants the whole body went security to each individual. Experience only could show the weakness of such a constitution, and how easily it might be infringed with impunity, from the difficulty of convicting men of faults, where the public alone was to be witness and judge; the laws could not but be eluded in many ways; disorders and inconveniences could not but multiply continually, till it became necessary to commit the dangerous trust of public authority to private persons, and the care of enforcing obedience to the deliberations of the people to the magistrate. For to say that chiefs were chosen before the confederacy was formed, and that the administrators of the laws were there before the laws themselves, is too absurd a supposition to consider seriously.

It would be as unreasonable to suppose that men at first threw themselves irretrievably and unconditionally into the arms of an absolute master, and that the first expedient which proud and unsubdued men hit upon for their common security was to run headlong into slavery. For what reason, in fact, did they take to themselves superiors, if it was not in order that they might be defended from oppression, and have protection for their lives, liberties and properties, which are, so to speak, the constituent elements of their being? Now, in the relations between man and man, the worst that can happen is for one to find himself at the mercy of another, and it would have been inconsistent with common-sense to begin by bestowing on a chief the only things they wanted his help to preserve. What equivalent could he offer them for so great a right? And if he had presumed to exact it under pretext of defending them, would he not have received the answer recorded in the fable: “What more can the enemy do to us?” It is therefore beyond dispute, and indeed the fundamental maxim of all political right, that people have set up chiefs to protect their liberty, and not to enslave them. If we have a prince, said Pliny to Trajan, it is to save ourselves from having a master.

Politicians indulge in the same sophistry about the love of liberty as philosophers about the state of nature. They judge, by what they see, of very different things, which they have not seen; and attribute to man a natural propensity to servitude, because the slaves within their observation are seen to bear the yoke with patience; they fail to reflect that it is with liberty as with innocence and virtue; the value is known only to those who possess them, and the taste for them is forfeited when they are forfeited themselves. “I know the charms of your country,” said Brasidas to a satrap, who was comparing the life at Sparta with that at Persepolis, “but you cannot know the pleasures of mine.”

An unbroken horse erects his mane, paws the ground and starts back impetuously at the sight of the bridle; while one which is properly trained suffers patiently even whip and spur; so savage man will not bend his neck to the yoke to which civilised man submits without a murmur, but prefers the most turbulent state of liberty to the most peaceful slavery. We cannot therefore, from the servility of nations already enslaved, judge of the natural disposition of mankind for or against slavery; we should go by the prodigious efforts of every free people to save itself from oppression. I know that the former are for ever holding forth in praise of the tranquillity they enjoy in their chains, and that they call a state of wretched servitude a state of peace: miserrimam servitutem pacem appellant.(2) But when I observe the latter sacrificing pleasure, peace, wealth, power and life itself to the preservation of that one treasure, which is so disdained by those who have lost it; when I see free-born animals dash their brains out against the bars of their cage, from an innate impatience of captivity; when I behold numbers of naked savages, that despise European pleasures, braving hunger, fire, the sword and death, to preserve nothing but their independence, I feel that it is not for slaves to argue about liberty.

With regard to paternal authority, from which some writers have derived absolute government and all society, it is enough, without going back to the contrary arguments of Locke and Sidney, to remark that nothing on earth can be further from the ferocious spirit of despotism than the mildness of that authority which looks more to the advantage of him who obeys than to that of him who commands; that, by the law of nature, the father is the child's master no longer than his help is necessary; that from that time they are both equal, the son being perfectly independent of the father, and owing him only respect and not obedience. For gratitude is a duty which ought to be paid, but not a right to be exacted; instead of saying that civil society is derived from paternal authority, we ought to say rather that the latter derives its principal force from the former. No individual was ever acknowledged as the father of many, till his sons and daughters remained settled around him. The goods of the father, of which he is really the master, are the ties which keep his children in dependence, and he may bestow on them, if he pleases, no share of his property, unless they merit it by constant deference to his will. But the subjects of an arbitrary despot are so far from having the like favour to expect from their chief, that they themselves and everything they possess are his property, or at least are considered by him as such; so that they are forced to receive, as a favour, the little of their own he is pleased to leave them. When he despoils them, he does but justice, and mercy in that he permits them to live.

By proceeding thus to test fact by right, we should discover as little reason as truth in the voluntary establishment of tyranny. It would also be no easy matter to prove the validity of a contract binding on only one of the parties, where all the risk is on one side, and none on the other; so that no one could suffer but he who bound himself. This hateful system is indeed, even in modern times, very far from being that of wise and good monarchs, and especially of the kings of France; as may be seen from several passages in their edicts; particularly from the following passage in a celebrated edict published in 1667 in the name and by order of Louis XIV.

“Let it not, therefore, be said that the Sovereign is not subject to the laws of his State; since the contrary is a true proposition of the right of nations, which flattery has sometimes attacked but good princes have always defended as the tutelary divinity of their dominions. How much more legitimate is it to say with the wise Plato, that the perfect felicity of a kingdom consists in the obedience of subjects to their prince, and of the prince to the laws, and in the laws being just and constantly directed to the public good!”(3)

I shall not stay here to inquire whether, as liberty is the noblest faculty of man, it is not degrading our very nature, reducing ourselves to the level of the brutes, which are mere slaves of instinct, and even an affront to the Author of our being, to renounce without reserve the most precious of all His gifts, and to bow to the necessity of committing all the crimes He has forbidden, merely to gratify a mad or a cruel master; or if this sublime craftsman ought not to be less angered at seeing His workmanship entirely destroyed than thus dishonoured. I will waive (if my opponents please) the authority of Barbeyrac, who, following Locke, roundly declares that no man can so far sell his liberty as to submit to an arbitrary power which may use him as it likes. For, he adds, this would be to sell his own life, of which he is not master. I shall ask only what right those who were not afraid thus to debase themselves could have to subject their posterity to the same ignominy, and to renounce for them those blessings which they do not owe to the liberality of their progenitors, and without which life itself must be a burden to all who are worthy of it.

Puffendorf says that we may divest ourselves of our liberty in favour of other men, just as we transfer our property from one to another by contracts and agreements. But this seems a very weak argument. For in the first place, the property I alienate becomes quite foreign to me, nor can I suffer from the abuse of it; but it very nearly concerns me that my liberty should not be abused, and I cannot without incurring the guilt of the crimes I may be compelled to commit, expose myself to become an instrument of crime. Besides, the right of property being only a convention of human institution, men may dispose of what they possess as they please; but this is not the case with the essential gifts of nature, such as life and liberty, which every man is permitted to enjoy, and of which it is at least doubtful whether any have a right to divest themselves. By giving up the one, we degrade our being; by giving up the other, we do our best to annul it; and, as no temporal good can indemnify us for the loss of either, it would be an offence against both reason and nature to renounce them at any price whatsoever. But, even if we could transfer our liberty, as we do our property, there would be a great difference with regard to the children, who enjoy the father's substance only by the transmission of his right; whereas, liberty being a gift which they hold from nature as being men, their parents have no right whatever to deprive them of it. As then, to establish slavery, it was necessary to do violence to nature, so, in order to perpetuate such a right, nature would have to be changed. Jurists, who have gravely determined that the child of a slave comes into the world a slave, have decided, in other words, that a man shall come into the world not a man.

I regard it then as certain, that government did not begin with arbitrary power, but that this is the depravation, the extreme term, of government, and brings it back, finally, to just the law of the strongest, which it was originally designed to remedy. Supposing, however, it had begun in this manner, such power, being in itself illegitimate, could not have served as a basis for the laws of society, nor, consequently, for the inequality they instituted.

Without entering at present upon the investigations which still remain to be made into the nature of the fundamental compact underlying all governments, I content myself with adopting the common opinion concerning it, and regard the establishment of the political body as a real contract between the people and the chiefs chosen by them: a contract by which both parties bind themselves to observe the laws therein expressed, which form the ties of their union. The people having in respect of their social relations concentrated all their wills in one, the several articles, concerning which this will is explained, become so many fundamental laws, obligatory on all the members of the State without exception, and one of these articles regulates the choice and power of the magistrates appointed to watch over the execution of the rest. This power extends to everything which may maintain the constitution, without going so far as to alter it. It is accompanied by honours, in order to bring the laws and their administrators into respect. The ministers are also distinguished by personal prerogatives, in order to recompense them for the cares and labour which good administration involves. The magistrate, on his side, binds himself to use the power he is entrusted with only in conformity with the intention of his constituents, to maintain them all in the peaceable possession of what belongs to them, and to prefer on every occasion the public interest to his own.

Before experience had shown, or knowledge of the human heart enabled men to foresee, the unavoidable abuses of such a constitution, it must have appeared so much the more excellent, as those who were charged with the care of its preservation had themselves most interest in it; for magistracy and the rights attaching to it being based solely on the fundamental laws, the magistrates would cease to be legitimate as soon as these ceased to exist; the people would no longer owe them obedience; and as not the magistrates, but the laws, are essential to the being of a State, the members of it would regain the right to their natural liberty.

If we reflect with ever so little attention on this subject, we shall find new arguments to confirm this truth, and be convinced from the very nature of the contract that it cannot be irrevocable; for, if there were no superior power capable of ensuring the fidelity of the contracting parties, or compelling them to perform their reciprocal engagements, the parties would be sole judges in their own cause, and each would always have a right to renounce the contract, as soon as he found that the other had violated its terms, or that they no longer suited his convenience. It is upon this principle that the right of abdication may possibly be founded. Now, if, as here, we consider only what is human in this institution, it is certain that, if the magistrate, who has all the power in his own hands, and appropriates to himself all the advantages of the contract, has none the less a right to renounce his authority, the people, who suffer for all the faults of their chief, must have a much better right to renounce their dependence. But the terrible and innumerable quarrels and disorders that would necessarily arise from so dangerous a privilege, show, more than anything else, how much human government stood in need of a more solid basis than mere reason, and how expedient it was for the public tranquillity that the divine will should interpose to invest the sovereign authority with a sacred and inviolable character, which might deprive subjects of the fatal right of disposing of it. If the world had received no other advantages from religion, this would be enough to impose on men the duty of adopting and cultivating it, abuses and all, since it has been the means of saving more blood than fanaticism has ever spilt. But let us follow the thread of our hypothesis.

The different forms of government owe their origin to the differing degrees of inequality which existed between individuals at the time of their institution. If there happened to be any one man among them pre-eminent in power, virtue, riches or personal influence, he became sole magistrate, and the State assumed the form of monarchy. If several, nearly equal in point of eminence, stood above the rest, they were elected jointly, and formed an aristocracy. Again, among a people who had deviated less from a state of nature, and between whose fortune or talents there was less disproportion, the supreme administration was retained in common, and a democracy was formed. It was discovered in process of time which of these forms suited men the best. Some peoples remained altogether subject to the laws; others soon came to obey their magistrates. The citizens laboured to preserve their liberty; the subjects, irritated at seeing others enjoying a blessing they had lost, thought only of making slaves of their neighbours. In a word, on the one side arose riches and conquests, and on the other happiness and virtue.

In these different governments, all the offices were at first elective; and when the influence of wealth was out of the question, the preference was given to merit, which gives a natural ascendancy, and to age, which is experienced in business and deliberate in council. The Elders of the Hebrews, the Gerontes at Sparta, the Senate at Rome, and the very etymology of our word Seigneur, show how old age was once held in veneration. But the more often the choice fell upon old men, the more often elections had to be repeated, and the more they became a nuisance; intrigues set in, factions were formed, party feeling grew bitter, civil wars broke out; the lives of individuals were sacrificed to the pretended happiness of the State; and at length men were on the point of relapsing into their primitive anarchy. Ambitious chiefs profited by these circumstances to perpetuate their offices in their own families; at the same time the people, already used to dependence, ease, and the conveniences of life, and already incapable of breaking its fetters, agreed to an increase of its slavery, in order to secure its tranquillity. Thus magistrates, having become hereditary, contracted the habit of considering their offices as a family estate, and themselves as proprietors of the communities of which they were at first only the officers, of regarding their fellow-citizens as their slaves, and numbering them, like cattle, among their belongings, and of calling themselves the equals of the gods and kings of kings.

If we follow the progress of inequality in these various revolutions, we shall find that the establishment of laws and of the right of property was its first term, the institution of magistracy the second, and the conversion of legitimate into arbitrary power the third and last; so that the condition of rich and poor was authorised by the first period; that of powerful and weak by the second; and only by the third that of master and slave, which is the last degree of inequality, and the term at which all the rest remain, when they have got so far, till the government is either entirely dissolved by new revolutions, or brought back again to legitimacy.

To understand this progress as necessary we must consider not so much the motives for the establishment of the body politic, as the forms it assumes in actuality, and the faults that necessarily attend it; for the flaws which make social institutions necessary are the same as make the abuse of them unavoidable. If we except Sparta, where the laws were mainly concerned with the education of children, and where Lycurgus established such morality as practically made laws needless — for laws as a rule, being weaker than the passions, restrain men without altering them — it would not be difficult to prove that every government, which scrupulously complied with the ends for which it was instituted, and guarded carefully against change and corruption, was set up unnecessarily. For a country, in which no one either evaded the laws or made a bad use of magisterial power, could require neither laws nor magistrates.

Political distinctions necessarily produce civil distinctions. The growing equality between the chiefs and the people is soon felt by individuals, and modified in a thousand ways according to passions, talents and circumstances. The magistrate could not usurp any illegitimate power, without giving distinction to the creatures with whom he must share it. Besides, individuals only allow themselves to be oppressed so far as they are hurried on by blind ambition, and, looking rather below than above them, come to love authority more than independence, and submit to slavery, that they may in turn enslave others. It is no easy matter to reduce to obedience a man who has no ambition to command; nor would the most adroit politician find it possible to enslave a people whose only desire was to be independent. But inequality easily makes its way among cowardly and ambitious minds, which are ever ready to run the risks of fortune, and almost indifferent whether they command or obey, as it is favourable or adverse. Thus, there must have been a time, when the eyes of the people were so fascinated, that their rulers had only to say to the least of men, “Be great, you and all your posterity,” to make him immediately appear great in the eyes of every one as well as in his own. His descendants took still more upon them, in proportion to their distance from him; the more obscure and uncertain the cause, the greater the effect; the greater the number of idlers one could count in a family, the more illustrious it was held to be.

If this were the place to go into details, I could readily explain how, even without the intervention of government, inequality of credit and authority became unavoidable among private persons, as soon as their union in a single society made them compare themselves one with another, and take into account the differences which they found out from the continual intercourse every man had to have with his neighbours.(4) These differences are of several kinds; but riches, nobility or rank, power and personal merit being the principal distinctions by which men form an estimate of each other in society, I could prove that the harmony or conflict of these different forces is the surest indication of the good or bad constitution of a State. I could show that among these four kinds of inequality, personal qualities being the origin of all the others, wealth is the one to which they are all reduced in the end; for, as riches tend most immediately to the prosperity of individuals, and are easiest to communicate, they are used to purchase every other distinction. By this observation we are enabled to judge pretty exactly how far a people has departed from its primitive constitution, and of its progress towards the extreme term of corruption. I could explain how much this universal desire for reputation, honours and advancement, which inflames us all, exercises and holds up to comparison our faculties and powers; how it excites and multiplies our passions, and, by creating universal competition and rivalry, or rather enmity, among men, occasions numberless failures, successes and disturbances of all kinds by making so many aspirants run the same course.

I could show that it is to this desire of being talked about, and this unremitting rage of distinguishing ourselves, that we owe the best and the worst things we possess, both our virtues and our vices, our science and our errors, our conquerors and our philosophers; that is to say, a great many bad things, and a very few good ones. In a word, I could prove that, if we have a few rich and powerful men on the pinnacle of fortune and grandeur, while the crowd grovels in want and obscurity, it is because the former prize what they enjoy only in so far as others are destitute of it; and because, without changing their condition, they would cease to be happy the moment the people ceased to be wretched.

These details alone, however, would furnish matter for a considerable work, in which the advantages and disadvantages of every kind of government might be weighed, as they are related to man in the state of nature, and at the same time all the different aspects, under which inequality has up to the present appeared, or may appear in ages yet to come, according to the nature of the several governments, and the alterations which time must unavoidably occasion in them, might be demonstrated. We should then see the multitude oppressed from within, in consequence of the very precautions it had taken to guard against foreign tyranny. We should see oppression continually gain ground without it being possible for the oppressed to know where it would stop, or what legitimate means was left them of checking its progress. We should see the rights of citizens, and the freedom of nations slowly extinguished, and the complaints, protests and appeals of the weak treated as seditious murmurings. We should see the honour of defending the common cause confined by statecraft to a mercenary part of the people. We should see taxes made necessary by such means, and the disheartened husbandman deserting his fields even in the midst of peace, and leaving the plough to gird on the sword. We should see fatal and capricious codes of honour established; and the champions of their country sooner or later becoming its enemies, and for ever holding their daggers to the breasts of their fellow-citizens. The time would come when they would be heard saying to the oppressor of their country —

Pectore si fratris gladium juguloque parentis

Condere me jubeas, gravidæque in viscera partu

Conjugis, invita peragam tamen omnia dextrâ.(5)

From great inequality of fortunes and conditions, from the vast variety of passions and of talents, of useless and pernicious arts, of vain sciences, would arise a multitude of prejudices equally contrary to reason, happiness and virtue. We should see the magistrates fomenting everything that might weaken men united in society, by promoting dissension among them; everything that might sow in it the seeds of actual division, while it gave society the air of harmony; everything that might inspire the different ranks of people with mutual hatred and distrust, by setting the rights and interests of one against those of another, and so strengthen the power which comprehended them all.

It is from the midst of this disorder and these revolutions, that despotism, gradually raising up its hideous head and devouring everything that remained sound and untainted in any part of the State, would at length trample on both the laws and the people, and establish itself on the ruins of the republic. The times which immediately preceded this last change would be times of trouble and calamity; but at length the monster would swallow up everything, and the people would no longer have either chiefs or laws, but only tyrants. From this moment there would be no question of virtue or morality; for despotism cui ex honesto nulla est spes, wherever it prevails, admits no other master; it no sooner speaks than probity and duty lose their weight and blind obedience is the only virtue which slaves can still practise.

This is the last term of inequality, the extreme point that closes the circle, and meets that from which we set out. Here all private persons return to their first equality, because they are nothing; and, subjects having no law but the will of their master, and their master no restraint but his passions, all notions of good and all principles of equity again vanish. There is here a complete return to the law of the strongest, and so to a new state of nature, differing from that we set out from; for the one was a state of nature in its first purity, while this is the consequence of excessive corruption. There is so little difference between the two states in other respects, and the contract of government is so completely dissolved by despotism, that the despot is master only so long as he remains the strongest; as soon as he can be expelled, he has no right to complain of violence. The popular insurrection that ends in the death or deposition of a Sultan is as lawful an act as those by which he disposed, the day before, of the lives and fortunes of his subjects. As he was maintained by force alone, it is force alone that overthrows him. Thus everything takes place according to the natural order; and, whatever may be the result of such frequent and precipitate revolutions, no one man has reason to complain of the injustice of another, but only of his own ill-fortune or indiscretion.

If the reader thus discovers and retraces the lost and forgotten road, by which man must have passed from the state of nature to the state of society; if he carefully restores, along with the intermediate situations which I have just described, those which want of time has compelled me to suppress, or my imagination has failed to suggest, he cannot fail to be struck by the vast distance which separates the two states. It is in tracing this slow succession that he will find the solution of a number of problems of politics and morals, which philosophers cannot settle. He will feel that, men being different in different ages, the reason why Diogenes could not find a man was that he sought among his contemporaries a man of an earlier period. He will see that Cato died with Rome and liberty, because he did not fit the age in which he lived; the greatest of men served only to astonish a world which he would certainly have ruled, had he lived five hundred years sooner. In a word, he will explain how the soul and the passions of men insensibly change their very nature; why our wants and pleasures in the end seek new objects; and why, the original man having vanished by degrees, society offers to us only an assembly of artificial men and factitious passions, which are the work of all these new relations, and without any real foundation in nature. We are taught nothing on this subject, by reflection, that is not entirely confirmed by observation. The savage and the civilised man differ so much in the bottom of their hearts and in their inclinations, that what constitutes the supreme happiness of one would reduce the other to despair. The former breathes only peace and liberty; he desires only to live and be free from labour; even the ataraxia of the Stoic falls far short of his profound indifference to every other object. Civilised man, on the other hand, is always moving, sweating, toiling and racking his brains to find still more laborious occupations; he goes on in drudgery to his last moment, and even seeks death to put himself in a position to live, or renounces life to acquire immortality. He pays his court to men in power, whom he hates, and to the wealthy, whom he despises; he stops at nothing to have the honour of serving them; he is not ashamed to value himself on his own meanness and their protection; and, proud of his slavery, he speaks with disdain of those, who have not the honour of sharing it. What a sight would the perplexing and envied labours of a European minister of State present to the eyes of a Caribbean! How many cruel deaths would not this indolent savage prefer to the horrors of such a life, which is seldom even sweetened by the pleasure of doing good! But, for him to see into the motives of all this solicitude, the words power and reputation, would have to bear some meaning in his mind; he would have to know that there are men who set a value on the opinion of the rest of the world; who can be made happy and satisfied with themselves rather on the testimony of other people than on their own. In reality, the source of all these differences is, that the savage lives within himself, while social man lives constantly outside himself, and only knows how to live in the opinion of others, so that he seems to receive the consciousness of his own existence merely from the judgment of others concerning him. It is not to my present purpose to insist on the indifference to good and evil which arises from this disposition, in spite of our many fine works on morality, or to show how, everything being reduced to appearances, there is but art and mummery in even honour, friendship, virtue, and often vice itself, of which we at length learn the secret of boasting; to show, in short, how, always asking others what we are, and never daring to ask ourselves, in the midst of so much philosophy, humanity and civilisation, and of such sublime codes of morality, we have nothing to show for ourselves but a frivolous and deceitful appearance, honour without virtue, reason without wisdom, and pleasure without happiness. It is sufficient that I have proved that this is not by any means the original state of man, but that it is merely the spirit of society, and the inequality which society produces, that thus transform and alter all our natural inclinations.

I have endeavoured to trace the origin and progress of inequality, and the institution and abuse of political societies, as far as these are capable of being deduced from the nature of man merely by the light of reason, and independently of those sacred dogmas which give the sanction of divine right to sovereign authority. It follows from this survey that, as there is hardly any inequality in the state of nature, all the inequality which now prevails owes its strength and growth to the development of our faculties and the advance of the human mind, and becomes at last permanent and legitimate by the establishment of property and laws. Secondly, it follows that moral inequality, authorised by positive right alone, clashes with natural right, whenever it is not proportionate to physical inequality; a distinction which sufficiently determines what we ought to think of that species of inequality which prevails in all civilised countries; since it is plainly contrary to the law of nature, however defined, that children should command old men, fools wise men, and that the privileged few should gorge themselves with superfluities, while the starving multitude are in want of the bare necessities of life.

It is in this sense we must understand that passage of Isocrates, in which he extols the primitive Athenians, for having determined which of the two kinds of equality was the most useful, viz., that which consists in dividing the same advantages indiscriminately among all the citizens, or that which consists in distributing them to each according to his deserts. These able politicians, adds the orator, banishing that unjust inequality which makes no distinction between good and bad men, adhered inviolably to that which rewards and punishes every man according to his deserts.

But in the first place, there never existed a society, however corrupt some may have become, where no difference was made between the good and the bad; and with regard to morality, where no measures can be prescribed by law exact enough to serve as a practical rule for a magistrate, it is with great prudence that, in order not to leave the fortune or quality of the citizens to his discretion, it prohibits him from passing judgment on persons and confines his judgment to actions. Only morals such as those of the ancient Romans can bear censors, and such a tribunal among us would throw everything into confusion. The difference between good and bad men is determined by public esteem; the magistrate being strictly a judge of right alone; whereas the public is the truest judge of morals, and is of such integrity and penetration on this head, that although it may be sometimes deceived, it can never be corrupted. The rank of citizens ought, therefore, to be regulated, not according to their personal merit — for this would put it in the power of the magistrate to apply the law almost arbitrarily — but according to the actual services done to the State, which are capable of being more exactly estimated.

Appendix


A FAMOUS author, reckoning up the good and evil of human life, and comparing the aggregates, finds that our pains greatly exceed our pleasures; so that, all things considered, human life is not at all a valuable gift. This conclusion does not surprise me; for the writer drew all his arguments from man in civilisation. Had he gone back to the state of nature, his inquiries would clearly have had a different result, and man would have been seen to be subject to very few evils not of his own creation. It has indeed cost us not a little trouble to make ourselves as wretched as we are. When we consider, on the one hand, the immense labours of mankind, the many sciences brought to perfection, the arts invented, the powers employed, the deeps filled up, the mountains levelled, the rocks shattered, the rivers made navigable, the tracts of land cleared, the lakes emptied, the marshes drained, the enormous structures erected on land, and the teeming vessels that cover the sea; and, on the other hand, estimate with ever so little thought, the real advantages that have accrued from all these works to mankind, we cannot help being amazed at the vast disproportion there is between these things, and deploring the infatuation of man, which, to gratify his silly pride and vain self-admiration, induces him eagerly to pursue all the miseries he is capable of feeling, though beneficent nature had kindly placed them out of his way.

That men are actually wicked, a sad and continual experience of them proves beyond doubt; but, all the same, I think I have shown that man is naturally good. What then can have depraved him to such an extent, except the changes that have happened in his constitution, the advances he has made, and the knowledge he has acquired? We may admire human society as much as we please; it will be none the less true that it necessarily leads men to hate each other in proportion as their interests clash, and to do one another apparent services, while they are really doing every imaginable mischief. What can be thought of a relation, in which the interest of every individual dictates rules directly opposite to those the public reason dictates to the community in general — in which every man finds his profit in the misfortunes of his neighbour? There is not perhaps any man in a comfortable position who has not greedy heirs, and perhaps even children, secretly wishing for his death; not a ship at sea, of which the loss would not be good news to some merchant or other; not a house, which some debtor of bad faith would not be glad to see reduced to ashes with all the papers it contains; not a nation which does not rejoice at the disasters that befall its neighbours. Thus it is that we find our advantage in the misfortunes of our fellow-creatures, and that the loss of one man almost always constitutes the prosperity of another. But it is still more pernicious that public calamities are the objects of the hopes and expectations of innumerable individuals. Some desire sickness, some mortality, some war, and some famine. I have seen men wicked enough to weep for sorrow at the prospect of a plentiful season; and the great and fatal fire of London, which cost so many unhappy persons their lives or their fortunes, made the fortunes of perhaps ten thousand others. I know that Montaigne censures Demades the Athenian for having caused to be punished a workman who, by selling his coffins very dear, was a great gainer by the deaths of his fellow-citizens; but, the reason alleged by Montaigne being that everybody ought to be punished, my point is clearly confirmed by it. Let us penetrate, therefore, the superficial appearances of benevolence, and survey what passes in the inmost recesses of the heart. Let us reflect what must be the state of things, when men are forced to caress and destroy one another at the same time; when they are born enemies by duty, and knaves by interest. It will perhaps be said that society is so formed that every man gains by serving the rest. That would be all very well, if he did not gain still more by injuring them. There is no legitimate profit so great, that it cannot be greatly exceeded by what may be made illegitimately; we always gain more by hurting our neighbours than by doing them good. Nothing is required but to know how to act with impunity; and to this end the powerful employ all their strength, and the weak all their cunning.

Savage man, when he has dined, is at peace with all nature, and the friend of all his fellow-creatures. If a dispute arises about a meal, he rarely comes to blows, without having first compared the difficulty of conquering his antagonist with the trouble of finding subsistence elsewhere; and, as pride does not come in, it all ends in a few blows; the victor eats, and the vanquished seeks provision somewhere else, and all is at peace. The case is quite different with man in the state of society, for whom first necessaries have to be provided, and then superfluities; delicacies follow next, then immense wealth, then subjects, and then slaves. He enjoys not a moment's relaxation; and what is yet stranger, the less natural and pressing his wants, the more headstrong are his passions, and, still worse, the more he has it in his power to gratify them; so that after a long course of prosperity, after having swallowed up treasures and ruined multitudes, the hero ends up by cutting every throat till he finds himself, at last, sole master of the world. Such is in miniature the moral picture, if not of human life, at least of the secret pretensions of the heart of civilised man.

Compare without partiality the state of the citizen with that of the savage, and trace out, if you can, how many inlets the former has opened to pain and death, besides those of his vices, his wants and his misfortunes. If you reflect on the mental afflictions that prey on us, the violent passions that waste and exhaust us, the excessive labour with which the poor are burdened, the still more dangerous indolence to which the wealthy give themselves up, so that the poor perish of want, and the rich of surfeit; if you reflect but a moment on the heterogeneous mixtures and pernicious seasonings of foods; the corrupt state in which they are frequently eaten; on the adulteration of medicines, the wiles of those who sell them, the mistakes of those who administer them, and the poisonous vessels in which they are prepared; on the epidemics bred by foul air in consequence of great numbers of men being crowded together, or those which are caused by our delicate way of living, by our passing from our houses into the open air and back again, by the putting on or throwing off our clothes with too little care, and by all the precautions which sensuality has converted into necessary habits, and the neglect of which sometimes costs us our life or health; if you take into account the conflagrations and earthquakes, which, devouring or overwhelming whole cities, destroy the inhabitants by thousands; in a word, if you add together all the dangers with which these causes are always threatening us, you will see how dearly nature makes us pay for the contempt with which we have treated her lessons.

I shall not here repeat, what I have elsewhere said of the calamities of war; but wish that those, who have sufficient knowledge, were willing or bold enough to make public the details of the villainies committed in armies by the contractors for commissariat and hospitals; we should see plainly that their monstrous frauds, already none too well concealed, which cripple the finest armies in less than no time, occasion greater destruction among the soldiers than the swords of the enemy.

The number of people who perish annually at sea, by famine, the scurvy, pirates, fire and shipwrecks, affords matter for another shocking calculation. We must also place to the credit of the establishment of property, and consequently to the institution of society, assassinations, poisonings, highway robberies, and even the punishments inflicted on the wretches guilty of these crimes; which, though expedient to prevent greater evils, yet by making the murder of one man cost the lives of two or more, double the loss to the human race.

What shameful methods are sometimes practised to prevent the birth of men, and cheat nature; either by brutal and depraved appetites which insult her most beautiful work — appetites unknown to savages or mere animals, which can spring only from the corrupt imagination of mankind in civilised countries; or by secret abortions, the fitting effects of debauchery and vitiated notions of honour; or by the exposure or murder of multitudes of infants, who fall victims to the poverty of their parents, or the cruel shame of their mothers; or, finally, by the mutilation of unhappy wretches, part of whose life, with their hope of posterity, is given up to vain singing, or, still worse, the brutal jealousy of other men: a mutilation which, in the last case, becomes a double outrage against nature from the treatment of those who suffer it, and from the use to which they are destined. But is it not a thousand times more common and more dangerous for paternal rights openly to offend against humanity? How many talents have not been thrown away, and inclinations forced, by the unwise constraint of fathers? How many men, who would have distinguished themselves in a fitting estate, have died dishonoured and wretched in another for which they had no taste! How many happy, but unequal, marriages have been broken or disturbed, and how many chaste wives have been dishonoured, by an order of things continually in contradiction with that of nature! How many good and virtuous husbands and wives are reciprocally punished for having been ill-assorted! How many young and unhappy victims of their parents' avarice plunge into vice, or pass their melancholy days in tears, groaning in the indissoluble bonds which their hearts repudiate and gold alone has formed! Fortunate sometimes are those whose courage and virtue remove them from life before inhuman violence makes them spend it in crime or in despair. Forgive me, father and mother, whom I shall ever regret, my complaint embitters your griefs; but would they might be an eternal and terrible example to every one who dares, in the name of nature, to violate her most sacred right?

If I have spoken only of those ill-starred unions which are the result of our system, is it to be thought that those over which love and sympathy preside are free from disadvantages? What if I should undertake to show humanity attacked in its very source, and even in the most sacred of all ties, in which fortune is consulted before nature, and, the disorders of society confounding all virtue and vice, continence becomes a criminal precaution, and a refusal to give life to a fellow-creature, an act of humanity? But, without drawing aside the veil which hides all these horrors, let us content ourselves with pointing out the evil which others will have to remedy.

To all this add the multiplicity of unhealthy trades, which shorten men's lives or destroy their bodies, such as working in the mines, and the preparing of metals and minerals, particularly lead, copper, mercury, cobalt, and arsenic; add those other dangerous trades which are daily fatal to many tilers, carpenters, masons and miners; put all these together and we can see, in the establishment and perfection of societies, the reasons for that diminution of our species, which has been noticed by many philosophers.

Luxury, which cannot be prevented among men who are tenacious of their own convenience and of the respect paid them by others, soon completes the evil society had begun, and, under the pretence of giving bread to the poor, whom it should never have made such, impoverishes all the rest, and sooner or later depopulates the State. Luxury is a remedy much worse than the disease it sets up to cure; or rather it is in itself the greatest of all evils, for every State, great or small; for, in order to maintain all the servants and vagabonds it creates, it brings oppression and ruin on the citizen and the labourer; it is like those scorching winds, which, covering the trees and plants with devouring insects, deprive useful animals of their subsistence and spread famine and death wherever they blow.

From society and the luxury to which it gives birth arise the liberal and mechanical arts, commerce, letters, and all those superfluities which make industry flourish, and enrich and ruin nations. The reason for such destruction is plain. It is easy to see, from the very nature of agriculture, that it must be the least lucrative of all the arts; for, its produce being the most universally necessary, the price must be proportionate to the abilities of the very poorest of mankind.

From the same principle may be deduced this rule, that the arts in general are more lucrative in proportion as they are less useful; and that, in the end, the most useful becomes the most neglected. From this we may learn what to think of the real advantages of industry and the actual effects of its progress.

Such are the sensible causes of all the miseries, into which opulence at length plunges the most celebrated nations. In proportion as arts and industry flourish, the despised husbandman, burdened with the taxes necessary for the support of luxury, and condemned to pass his days between labour and hunger, forsakes his native field, to seek in towns the bread he ought to carry thither. The more our capital cities strike the vulgar eye with admiration, the greater reason is there to lament the sight of the abandoned countryside, the large tracts of land that lie uncultivated, the roads crowded with unfortunate citizens turned beggars or highwaymen, and doomed to end their wretched lives either on a dunghill or on the gallows. Thus the State grows rich on the one hand, and feeble and depopulated on the other; the mightiest monarchies, after having taken immense pains to enrich and depopulate themselves, fall at last a prey to some poor nation, which has yielded to the fatal temptation of invading them, and then, growing opulent and weak in its turn, is itself invaded and ruined by some other.

Let any one inform us what produced the swarms of barbarians, who overran Europe, Asia and Africa for so many ages. Was their prodigious increase due to their industry and arts, to the wisdom of their laws, or to the excellence of their political system? Let the learned tell us why, instead of multiplying to such a degree, these fierce and brutal men, without sense or science, without education, without restraint, did not destroy each other hourly in quarrelling over the productions of their fields and woods. Let them tell us how these wretches could have the presumption to oppose such clever people as we were, so well trained in military discipline, and possessed of such excellent laws and institutions; and why, since society has been brought to perfection in northern countries, and so much pains taken to instruct their inhabitants in their social duties and in the art of living happily and peaceably together, we see them no longer produce such numberless hosts as they used once to send forth to be the plague and terror of other nations. I fear some one may at last answer me by saying, that all these fine things, arts, sciences and laws, were wisely invented by men, as a salutary plague, to prevent the too great multiplication of mankind, lest the world, which was given us for a habitation, should in time be too small for its inhabitants.

What, then, is to be done? Must societies be totally abolished? Must meum and tuum be annihilated, and must we return again to the forests to live among bears? This is a deduction in the manner of my adversaries, which I would as soon anticipate as let them have the shame of drawing. O you, who have never heard the voice of heaven, who think man destined only to live this little life and die in peace; you, who can resign in the midst of populous cities your fatal acquisitions, your restless spirits, your corrupt hearts and endless desires; resume, since it depends entirely on ourselves, your ancient and primitive innocence; retire to the woods, there to lose the sight and remembrance of the crimes of your contemporaries; and be not apprehensive of degrading your species, by renouncing its advances in order to renounce its vices. As for men like me, whose passions have destroyed their original simplicity, who can no longer subsist on plants or acorns, or live without laws and magistrates; those who were honoured in their first father with supernatural instructions; those who discover, in the design of giving human actions at the start a morality which they must otherwise have been so long in acquiring, the reason for a precept in itself indifferent and inexplicable on every other system; those, in short, who are persuaded that the Divine Being has called all mankind to be partakers in the happiness and perfection of celestial intelligences, all these will endeavour to merit the eternal prize they are to expect from the practice of those virtues, which they make themselves follow in learning to know them. They will respect the sacred bonds of their respective communities; they will love their fellow-citizens, and serve them with all their might; they will scrupulously obey the laws, and all those who make or administer them; they will particularly honour those wise and good princes, who find means of preventing, curing or even palliating all these evils and abuses, by which we are constantly threatened; they will animate the zeal of their deserving rulers, by showing them, without flattery or fear, the importance of their office and the severity of their duty. But they will not therefore have less contempt for a constitution that cannot support itself without the aid of so many splendid characters, much oftener wished for than found; and from which, notwithstanding all their pains and solicitude, there always arise more real calamities than even apparent advantages.
