第一章　扮演朝圣者


“没有礼物送，不算圣诞节。”乔躺在地毯上嘟囔着。

“贫穷真可怕！”美格低头看看一身旧衣服，叹息道。

“有人漂亮东西应有尽有，有人却样样没有，我看不公平。”小艾美委屈地哼着鼻子，加了一句。

“可我们有爸妈和姐妹相亲啊！”贝丝坐在角落里，倒是心满意足地说。

听了振奋人心的话，四张小脸在炉火的映照下亮堂起来，但听了乔忧伤的话，马上又阴沉下去了：

“可爸不在，长时间当兵在外。”虽然她没有说：“说不定有去无回了呢！”可心里都默默地加了这一句。她们想念着远方战场[1]上的父亲。

大家沉默了片刻，美格换了一种语气说道：

“妈妈提出，今年圣诞不送礼，你们知道理由的，今年冬天对谁来说都难熬。现在男人们在军营里受煎熬，她觉得我们不应该花钱找乐。我们虽然做不了那么多，但可以，也应该乐意做出这么一点小小的牺牲。恐怕我是做不到哇。”美格摇摇头，一想到那些朝思暮想的漂亮礼物，不由懊丧起来。

“我说，我们要花的那点点钱也无济于事。每人只有一元钱，就是捐给了军队也没什么用。没错，我不指望妈妈给什么，你们也不会送，可我真的想替自己买一本《水精灵》[2]，老早就想买了。”乔说。要知道，她是个“书虫”。

“我那一元钱本来想买新乐谱的。”贝丝说。她叹了一小口气，声音轻得除了壁炉刷和水壶架谁也没听到。

“我要买一盒上好的费伯牌绘图铅笔，确实需要嘛。”艾美毅然决然地说。

“妈妈并没有规定我们钱该怎么花，她不会希望我们什么都不要。不如大家都买自己想买的，开心一下。我说，挣这笔钱，我们够卖力的了。”乔一边高声说，一边审视着自己的鞋跟，颇有绅士风度。

“可不是嘛——差不多整天都在教那些讨厌的孩子，本来倒希望回家轻松一下的。”美格又抱怨开了。

“你的辛苦比我差得远呢，”乔说，“难道你愿意成天和神经质、大惊小怪的老太婆关在一起吗？她把人使唤得团团转，却里外不称心，把人折腾得恨不得跳窗出去，要么就大哭一场。”

“做一点事情就心烦是不好，不过，我真的觉得洗碗碟、理东西是世上最糟糕的工作。搞得脾气暴躁不算，手也变得这么僵硬，连琴都弹不好了。”贝丝看看粗手，叹了口气，这回大家都听到了。

“就不信你们哪个人有我辛苦，”艾美大声道，“你们反正用不着跟野姑娘们一起上学的。你功课搞不懂，却老是烦你，还嘲笑你身上的衣服。爸爸没钱，却要被她们‘标榜’。连你鼻子不漂亮，也要奚落一下。”

“我想，你是说‘诽谤’吧，不要说成‘标榜’，好像爸爸是个泡菜罐子，要贴标签似的。”乔笑着纠正道。

“我知道我在说什么，也不用疯痴（讽刺）嘛。就是要多用生词，能提高字（词）汇量嘛。”艾美神气活现地回嘴。

“别斗嘴了，妹妹们。乔，谁叫爸爸在我们小时候丢了钱。难道你不希望我们有钱吗？天哪！没有烦恼事，我们会有多么快乐多么乖哟！”美格说，她还记得过去的好日子。

“前几天你说过，我们过得比金家孩子要快活得多。他们虽然有钱，却一天到晚都在明争暗斗，可以说苦恼不断。”

“我是这么说过，贝丝。唔，现在还是这么认为呢。虽然不得不干活，我们却可玩可闹。就像乔说的，我们是一票很快活的人。”

“乔尽说这样的土话！”艾美不无责备地看着手脚伸展躺在地毯上的长条身躯道。乔马上坐起来，双手插入口袋，吹起了口哨。

“不要嘛，乔。男生做的！”

“所以才这么做。”

“最恨粗丫头，一点淑女味儿都没有！”

“也讨厌装腔作势的妮子，就知道扭扭捏捏！”

“巢中鸟儿，和睦相处。”和事佬贝丝唱起了歌，脸上的表情滑稽可笑。两个尖嗓门轻了下来，化作一阵笑声。“窝内斗”暂时熄火了。

“说实在的，姑娘们，你们俩都不对。”美格摆出大姐架势，开始训话，“约瑟芬已经长大，该丢掉小子们的把戏，老实些。小的时候，这没什么。可现在人高马大，头发都网起来了，要记住你是大姑娘了。”

“才不是呢！如果头发网起来就算大姑娘，那二十岁以前，我绝对只梳两根辫子。”乔叫了起来，扯掉了发网，抖落一头栗色长发，“想到自己要长大，要成为马奇小姐，可真是讨厌。就是不高兴穿长礼服，偏不做翠菊式的中国娇小姐！我就是喜欢男孩子的游戏，男孩子的工作，男孩子的风度。可偏偏是个女的，够糟的了！不是男儿身，真没劲。再没有比现在更糟糕的，多想跟爸上战场，却只能待在家里织东西，像个臭老太！”乔晃动蓝军袜，把针抖得叮当作响，线团也滚到了屋子另一边。

“可怜的乔！太糟糕了，可也没办法可想呀。认命吧，只能把名字改得有男子气一些，当我们姐妹的兄弟。”贝丝说着，用那世上所有洗碗碟打扫工作都不能使其粗鲁的手，轻轻地抚摸着靠在她膝上的头发蓬乱的脑袋。

“至于你，艾美。”美格继续数落说，“你就是太讲究，太古板。你的神态现在有点滑稽，一不注意，就会长成装模作样的小憨鹅。要是不刻意追求高雅，你倒举止优雅，言谈文雅，我挺喜欢的。可你说的那些蠢话，和乔的土话没什么两样。”

“如果乔是假小子，艾美是憨鹅，请问，我是什么呢？”贝丝问，她也想挨一下训。

“你是小宝贝，没别的。”美格亲切地回答。没人唱反调，因为这位胆小的“老鼠”是家中的宠儿。

鉴于青少年读者都想知道人物长的模样，我们借此机会，简单描绘一下坐在暮色中麻利地做着针线活的四姐妹。此时，屋外十二月冬雪轻轻地飘落，屋内炉火噼啪蹿动。这是一间旧房子，地毯有点褪色，家具也很朴素，但屋里很舒适。墙上挂着一两幅别致的图画，壁橱内堆满了书，窗台盛开着菊花和圣诞时应景的圣诞蔷薇花。屋里洋溢着一股宁静、温馨的居家气氛。

玛格丽特，小名美格，十六岁，是四姐妹最大的一个。她长得十分秀丽，体态丰满，肌肤白皙；天生一双大眼睛，褐色的头发又密又软，讨人喜欢的小嘴，洁白的双手，这一切都令她颇为自得。乔，大名叫约瑟芬，十五岁，长得又高又瘦，肌肤偏黑，让人不由得想起小公马，修长的双臂很碍事，似乎永远都无所适从。她嘴巴刚毅，鼻子有点滑稽，灰色的眼睛炯炯有神，好像洞察一切，眼神时而凶巴巴的，时而滑稽可笑，时而若有所思。浓密的长发是她的一个亮点，但为了利落，通常用发网束起来。乔肩膀厚实，大手宽脚，穿的衣服显得很松快。她正在快速长个成年，但姑娘不自在的表情透出几分无奈。伊丽莎白——大家都叫小名贝丝，十三岁，皮肤红润，秀发光润，双眸明亮，举止腼腆，声音羞怯，面带安详，不露声色。父亲称她为“小静”，这个称呼完全适宜，因为她似乎活在自己快乐的世界中，只敢与信任热爱的少数人打交道。艾美，年龄最小，却是家中要员——至少在她自己看来是如此。她端庄秀丽，白肌肤，蓝眼睛，黄头发卷曲着披到肩头，脸色泛白，身材苗条。她举止讲究，颇具年轻淑女风度。四姐妹的性格怎样，容后分解。

时钟敲了六下，贝丝扫净了壁炉面，把一双便鞋放在旁边烘暖。看到这双旧鞋，屋里就有了好情绪。姑娘们想起妈妈就要回来了，都兴奋起来准备迎接。美格结束了训话，点亮了灯。艾美自觉让出安乐椅。乔忘记了疲倦，坐起来把鞋子凑近炉火。

“鞋子太破旧了。妈咪得穿新的。”

“我想用我那元钱给她买一双。”贝丝说。

“不，我来买！”艾美大声道。

“我最大。”美格刚开口，乔就语气坚决地打断了她：

“爸爸不在，我就是家中的男人，由我来买鞋。爸爸说过的，他出门时，我要特别照看好妈的。”

“我看还是这样吧，”贝丝说，“每人为妈妈买一样圣诞礼物，自己嘛，就别买了。”

“那才像你，乖乖！买什么好呢？”乔叫道。

每个人都静静地思考了片刻，然后，美格好像受自己漂亮的手的启发，宣布说：“我要送一副精美的手套。”

“军鞋，送最好的。”乔嚷嚷着。

“手帕，修边的。”贝丝说。

“我要买一小瓶古龙香水，妈妈喜欢的，而且不贵，还可以留点钱给自己买铅笔。”接着艾美说。

“那礼物怎么送呢？”美格问。

“放在桌子上，把妈妈叫进来，然后看着她把礼盒打开。难道忘了以前生日是怎么过的吗？”乔回答说。

“以前，轮到我坐大椅子，戴上花冠，看你们一个个走过来，送礼物，吻一下，慌死我啦。我喜欢礼物和亲吻，但你们坐着瞪眼，看我把礼盒打开，太可怕了。”贝丝说，边烤面包准备茶点，边烘脸取暖。

“就让妈咪以为我们给自己买了礼物，然后给她个惊喜。明天下午就去买东西。美格，圣诞节晚上的戏，还要好好排演一下的。”乔说，手靠着背，头仰着，踱来踱去。

“我这可是最后一次演戏了，超龄了嘛。”美格喃喃道。她在“化妆”打闹的时候非常孩子气。

“这我知道，你才不会洗手不干呢。只要披下头发，拖着白礼服，戴上金纸珠宝，就招摇上台了。你是我们这里的最佳演员呢，你要是退出舞台，就一切都完了。”乔说，“今晚就应该排演的。过来，艾美，排练一下昏厥的场面，你演得是硬板硬板的呢。”

“没有办法的。没看见过别人昏厥嘛。我可不喜欢跟你一样，跌跌撞撞倒地，搞得自己鼻青脸肿。如果倒下容易，我就倒下，做不到的话，就跌倒在椅子上，动作优雅一点。才不在乎雨果拿手枪戳着我呢！”艾美回嘴道。她没有戏剧天赋，但个子小巧，剧中反角扛得动，可以把她惊叫着扛出场。

“要这样做动作。双手捏紧，摇摇摆摆地走过来。口中狂叫：‘罗得里戈，救救我！救救我！'”乔情不自禁叫起来，夸张得很刺激。

艾美跟着她做，但僵硬地抬着手，走台一冲一冲的，活像机械开动。她发出的“哎哟！”声，令人想起遭受针扎的情形，而不是惊恐万状，痛苦不堪。乔绝望地哀叹着，美格咯咯大笑。贝丝聚精会神地看戏，连面包烤焦了也浑然不知。

“没救了！到时候好自为之吧，观众笑了可不要怪我哟。来吧，美格。”

情节发展顺利，堂彼得罗目中无人似的，一口气作了两页长的报告。女巫海格煮了一锅癞蛤蟆，哼唱着恐怖符咒，产生了怪诞的效果。罗得里戈英勇地挣开锁链，雨果“哈哈”地狂喊着，悔恨交加，砒霜毒发身亡。

“这是我们的最高水平啦。”美格说。这时死掉的反角坐了起来，揉揉胳膊肘。

“乔姐，真不知道，你是怎么编出这么精彩的东西来上演的。就像莎士比亚再世！”贝丝吆喝着。她坚信，姐姐们都是天才，而且无所不能。

“别这么说，”乔谦虚着，“我确实认为《女巫诅咒》这出悲剧是好戏。不过，我倒是想试试《麦克白》的，就是舞台没有装地板活门，好让班柯从地底下钻出来。我一直想扮演屠夫角色的。‘我眼前看到的，是不是宝剑？'”乔喃喃道，转动着眼珠，在空中瞎抓着，她以前看过悲剧名角的表演。

“住手，烤面包的叉子，怎么不叉面包，却叉着妈妈的鞋子。贝丝成了戏痴！”美格喝道。众人哄堂大笑，排演就此结束了。

“姑娘们这么高兴，别提我多开心了。”门口传来一个愉快的声音，演员、观众们纷纷转身迎接母亲。这位个子高挑的女士露出“有事就找我”的眼神，十分和蔼可亲。她的衣着并不讲究，但神情颇为高贵。姑娘们认为，那灰白的披风和过时的帽子，穿在世界上最棒的妈妈身上。

“宝贝们哪，今天过得怎么样？我有很多事情要做，明天要送的礼盒没准备好，所以没有回来吃正餐。贝丝，有客人来吗？美格，感冒怎么样了？乔，你好像累得要命。来，亲我一下，宝贝。”

马奇太太一边慈爱地问长问短，一边脱下了湿衣服，换上暖和的便鞋，在安乐椅上坐下。然后，她让艾美坐在腿上，准备享受她忙碌的一天中最愉快的时光。姑娘们忙这忙那，各尽所能，努力把一切都安排得舒舒服服。美格摆茶桌。乔搬柴，放椅子，却把柴火撒落了，把椅子打翻了，弄得噼啪直响。贝丝在客厅和厨房间跑来跑去，一声不吭地忙碌着。艾美则袖手旁观，在一边发号施令。

一家子围坐桌边时，马奇太太脸上显得特别高兴，说道：“晚饭后有好东西招待你们。”

姐妹们脸上马上云开日出般露出灿烂的笑容。贝丝拍拍手，也顾不得手上拿着饼干。乔把餐巾往空中一抛，大声嚷嚷：“信！信！爸爸万岁！”

“是的，一封长长的信。他身体健康，说是能安度寒冬，而且过得比我们想象的要好。他祝我们圣诞快乐，万事如意，特别是祝福你们，姑娘们。”马奇太太说着拍拍口袋，仿佛里面装着珍宝。

“快点吃！艾美，不要勾起小指，边吃边傻笑。”乔嚷嚷着，急于享受招待，却被茶噎了一口，面包都掉到了地毯上，涂黄油的一面朝下。

贝丝不再吃了，默默地走到阴暗的角落坐下，等候其他人吃完，憧憬着喜悦的时刻到来。

“爸爸超过参军年龄，身体也不适合当兵，但还要去做随军牧师。我觉得他真伟大！”美格热切地说。

“我真想当摇拨浪鼓的，随军贩[3]——叫什么来着？或者护士，那样就可以守着他，帮助他。”乔激动地说，还唉了一声。

“睡帐篷，吃各种难吃的东西，还用铁皮杯喝水，肯定够受的。”艾美叹息道。

“他什么时候回家呢，妈咪？”贝丝问，声音有点颤抖。

“要好几个月呢，乖乖，除非他生病。只要能在部队留一刻，他就会永远忠于职守。我们也不会要他抛下将士们提前回家一分钟。过来吧，听我读信。”

大家围在炉火前，妈妈坐在大椅子里，贝丝坐在她脚边，美格和艾美坐在椅子的两个扶手上，乔靠在椅背上，即使来信碰巧催人泪下，也没人会注意到她感情的表露。在那艰难岁月里写的信，很少有不感人的，特别是爸爸寄回家的。这封信却很少提到承受艰辛、面对危险和强抑思乡情，而是鼓舞人心的平安家书，写的都是生动的部队生活、行军打仗和军事新闻。只是在最后，字里行间才流露出慈父的爱心和对家中幼女的挂念。





转达给她们我所有的爱和亲吻吧。告诉她们，我白天想念她们，夜里为她们祈祷，她们的爱时时刻刻都给了我莫大的安慰。要再等待一年才能和她们相见，似乎很漫长，但是请提醒她们，我们在等待中都有工作可做，不至于虚度这些艰难的日子。我相信，她们会牢记我的话，会做你的乖孩子，踏实地做力所能及的事，勇敢地进行自我斗争，很好地战胜自己。当我回来时，我会更爱我的小妇人们，并为她们感到无比自豪。





读到这一段，每个人都在抽噎。乔任凭颗颗泪珠淌下鼻尖，并不为此感到羞愧。艾美一点都不在乎鬈发起皱，一头扑在了妈的肩上，呜咽着说：“我真自私！可我真的会努力学好。这样，他就不会对我失望了。”

“我们都会学好的！”美格哭着说，“我太注重打扮，好逸恶劳。以后不会这样了，我尽量改正。”

“爸爸喜欢叫我‘小妇人’，我会努力做到，不再粗野，在家做分内事，不再想到外出。”乔说，可心里知道，在家里不发脾气比对付南方一两个的叛军要困难得多。

贝丝什么都没说，只是用蓝军袜擦去泪水，然后全身心地做编织，争分夺秒地履行手头的义务。她幼小的心灵已经暗下决心，爸爸一年后凯旋、一家团聚时，要实现爸爸的愿望。

马奇太太打破了乔说完话之后的静默，欢快地说：“还记得小时候扮演《天路历程》的情形吗？你们让我把拼缝口袋绑在背脊上做担子，交给你们帽子、拐棍和纸卷，从地下室也就是‘毁灭之城’往上爬，爬呀，爬呀，穿过整个屋子，来到屋顶，你们把收集的美好东西都放在那里，充当‘天城’。那样玩，你们别提多高兴了。”

“多么来劲，特别是偷过狮子身边啦，奋战恶魔啦，穿越小妖精出没的幽谷啦。”乔说。

“我喜欢包袱掉下来，滚下楼梯的情景。”美格说。

“我最喜欢的情景是走出来，上到平屋顶，屋顶满是鲜花、树木和漂亮东西，大家站在那里，在太阳底下纵情歌唱。”贝丝笑着说，好像那快乐时刻又重演了。

“已经不太记得了，只知道当时害怕地下室和黑暗入口，还有总是喜欢藏在屋顶的牛奶蛋糕。假如不是太老了，这种东西倒喜欢再来玩一遍的。”艾美说。她才十二岁，却已经开始谈论抛下孩子气的东西。

“玩这种东西永远不会太老的，乖乖，因为我们始终以这样那样的方式玩着这种游戏的。我们的负担就在眼前，我们的道路躺在脚下。渴望美德，渴望幸福，这是引导我们克服困难，改正错误，走向问心无愧的向导。问心无愧才是真正的天城。好了，小朝圣者，你们是不是再来一次呢？不是玩耍，而是一本正经地做。看看爸爸回家之前，你们能走多远。”

“真的，妈妈？我们的包袱在哪儿？”艾美问道，她喜欢就事论事。

“刚才你们每个人都讲了自己肩负的担子，只有贝丝没说。我想她还没有负担。”母亲说。

“不，我有的。我的是碗碟和掸子，而且还嫉妒有漂亮钢琴的女孩，害怕见生人。”

贝丝的包袱这么滑稽，大家都想笑，但谁都没笑，因为那样会深深地伤害她的感情。

“我们说干就干，”美格若有所思地说，“这其实就跟学好一样，戏里的故事可以帮助我们。虽然我们也想学好，但很难，所以就忘了，就不尽力去做。”

“今晚我们本来在绝望的深渊里，妈妈像书中的‘帮助’一样，把我们拉了出来。我们应该像基督徒一样，有一卷指导书[4]。那个怎么办呢？”乔问，为自己的想象力给烦闷的职责增添了几分浪漫而感到高兴。

“圣诞节的早上，看看枕头底下，会发现指导书的。”马奇太太回答说。

她们趁老汉娜清理饭桌的当口，讨论着新的打算。四个工作篮子拿出来了，姑娘们飞针走线，为马奇姑婆做床单。缝纫工作枯燥得很，但是今晚没有人嘟囔抱怨。她们采纳了乔的计划，把长线缝分成四个部分，分别叫做欧洲、亚洲、非洲、美洲，特别是针线跨国越洲时，讨论各国概况，这样活计就突飞猛进了。

九点钟，她们停下活计，按照惯例，上床前要唱歌。除了贝丝，没人能在那破旧的钢琴上弹出什么曲调来，但她心灵手巧，通过轻触泛黄的琴键，她们唱出的简单歌曲就有了悦耳的伴奏了。美格的嗓音就像长笛，她和母亲领唱。艾美唱歌活像蟋蟀叫，乔随心所欲地拖拉着旋律，总是在不该出来的地方蹦出沙哑声或者颤音，破坏了哀怨的调子。她们从牙牙学语时就这样做了——





天上星星亮晶晶。





这个的小合唱已经成了家庭惯例，谁叫母亲是天生的歌手呢。早上一睁眼，就能听到她的嗓音，走进走出都在婉转歌唱；晚上临睡前也能听到她的欢唱。对于那熟悉的催眠曲，姑娘们不管长得多大，永远不会听厌的。

第二章　圣诞快乐


圣诞节一早，天刚蒙蒙亮，乔第一个醒了。壁炉上没挂着礼物长袜，她一阵惆怅，就像很久以前的一次。不过那一次，是她的小袜子由于塞满了吃的东西而掉在了地上。接着，她记起了母亲的诺言，便把手摸到枕头底下，拿到一本深红色封面的小书。这本书她很熟悉，书中的古老故事讲的是最完美的人生。乔觉得，这本书能真正引导朝圣者踏上漫漫人生路。她一声“圣诞快乐”吵醒了美格，让她看看枕头下有什么。美格找到了一本绿封面的书，里面是相同的图画，还有母亲写的祝福语，因而，唯一的礼物在她们看来显得弥足珍贵。不一会儿，贝丝和艾美也醒了，一番翻寻，也找到了她们的小书——一本灰褐色，还有一本蓝色。大家都坐起来，端详着，谈论着。东方射出缕缕红霞，宣告新的一天开始了。

尽管玛格丽特有点虚荣，秉性却温和虔诚，这也不知不觉地影响着妹妹们，特别是乔。乔跟她特别亲，姐姐提建议时总是和颜悦色的，所以她言听计从。

“妹妹们，”美格正色道，看看旁边的一头乱发，再瞧瞧隔壁房间戴睡帽的两个小头。“妈妈要我们阅读这些宝书，珍爱它们，重视它们，我们说做就做。我们曾经深信不疑，但爸爸离开了，战祸搞得我们心神不宁，许多事情也就荒废了。你们随意吧，反正我打算把宝书放在桌子上，每天一醒来就读一点点。我清楚，读宝书对我有好处，能帮助我度过每一天。”

她打开新书读起来。乔搂住她，脸贴脸，也读开了，不得安宁的脸上，出现了少有的平静表情。

“美格有多好哇！过来，艾美，我们跟着做吧。我帮助你认生词。我们不懂的，让她们讲解。”贝丝悄声说，被漂亮的宝书所吸引，为姐姐的榜样所感染。

“我的宝书蓝封面，我喜欢。”艾美说。书页轻轻翻动，两个房间里都静静的。冬日阳光爬进来，向聪明的脑袋和认真的脸蛋问候圣诞节。

“妈妈在哪里？”半小时后，美格问。她和乔跑下楼找母亲，感谢圣诞礼物。

“天知道。有个穷棒子跑来讨饭，妈妈马上就去了，说是去看看人家缺什么。从来没见过这样的女人，把吃的、喝的、穿的和烧的都送给别人。”汉娜回应道。美格一出世，汉娜就跟这家子一起过，尽管只是仆人，可全家人都把她当朋友。

“我想马上会回来的。你先煎饼，把东西都备好。”美格说。她要把篮子里收集的礼物检查一遍。礼物放在沙发底下，到时候要拿出来。“哎，艾美买的古龙香水哪里去了？”看到小瓶子不见了，她就问。

“她刚才拿出去了，说要系上一根丝带什么的。”乔回答。她正在满屋子跳舞，要把硬实的新军鞋穿柔软。

“我的手帕真漂亮，是不是！汉娜替我洗的，还熨平了呢。上面的标记字样是我自己绣的。”贝丝说着，自豪地看着不太工整的字母，这活可花了她不少工夫。

“哎哟！完了，她把‘马奇太太’绣成了‘妈妈’。太滑稽了！”乔拿起一块手帕叫了起来。

“这不行吗？我想这样绣比较好，因为美格的首字母是M. M.，和马奇太太的一样。这些手帕我只想妈妈一个人用。”贝丝说着，显得心烦意乱。

“乖乖，没关系，主意不错——还想得挺周到的。现在可没人会弄错了。我相信，妈妈会很高兴的。”美格一边对乔皱皱眉头，一边笑着对贝丝说。

“妈妈来了。把篮子藏好，快点！”乔大声叫了起来。这时门砰地一响，过道里传来了脚步声。

艾美急匆匆跑进来，看到姐姐们都在等她，显得不好意思。

“到哪里去了？背后藏的什么？”美格问道。看到艾美头戴风帽，身穿大衣，她感到十分惊讶，一向懒惰的艾美，竟然这么早出门。

“别笑我，乔！我不想大家这么早知道。我只是想把这小瓶香水换成大的。用掉了所有的钱。我是真的努力在做，可不想再那么自私了。”

说着，艾美拿出一个精致的香水瓶，这是用先前的那个便宜货换的。她努力克服自私，显得真挚而谦逊。美格当场就一把抱住她，乔宣布她是“将牌”，贝丝则跑到窗口，摘了一朵漂亮无比的蔷薇，来装饰这瓶名贵香水。

“你们知道，今天早上读书，谈到要做个好孩子，我就为我的礼物感到惭愧。于是，我一起床就跑到街上，去换了这瓶香水。现在，我很高兴，我的礼物最漂亮。”

临街的门又砰地一响，她们把篮子迅速放到沙发下，然后坐到桌边，等着吃早餐。

“圣诞快乐，妈咪！永远快乐！谢谢你送的书。我们已经读了一下，以后每天都读一点。”她们齐声叫道。

“圣诞快乐，小宝贝们！你们马上就开始读，我很高兴，希望能持之以恒。趁我们还没坐下，我想先说几句。离这儿不远，躺着一个贫苦妇女和刚出生的婴儿。没有生火，六个小孩挤在一张床上，才不至于冻僵。也没有吃的。最大的那个男孩跑来告诉我，他们又冷又饿。宝贝们，愿意把早餐送给他们做圣诞礼物吗？”

她们等了个把钟头，也都特别饿，好一会儿没人说话。也就那么一会儿，乔就迫不及待地说：

“真巧，你来的是时候，我们还没开始吃呢！”

“我可以帮手把东西拿过去，送给那些可怜的小孩吗？”贝丝急切地问。

“我来拿奶油和松饼。”艾美接上去说，一副英雄模样。她放弃了自己喜欢吃的东西。

美格已经在把荞麦面糊盖上，并把面包放到一个大盘子里。

“我早就想到了，你们会愿意的。”马奇太太满意地笑着，“你们都去帮忙，我们回来再吃早饭，面包加牛奶，正餐时再补回来。”

她们很快就准备好，然后队伍就出发了。幸亏天色还早，她们走后街，几乎没人看到，也就没人笑话这支奇怪的队伍。

这是一户可怜的人家。屋子里空空的，没有生火，窗户破败。床上被褥破烂不堪，躺着病弱的母亲和啼哭不止的婴儿。一群孩子脸色苍白，肚里空空，挤在一条旧被子里抱团取暖。

看见姑娘们进来，一个个眼睛睁得大大的，冻得发紫的嘴唇边露出了笑容！

“哎呀，我的天哪！善良天使来看望我们了！”贫苦女人用德语欢呼起来。

“是滑稽天使，还戴着风帽和手套。”乔逗得他们哈哈大笑。

好像真的是善良天使下凡，不久就显灵了。汉娜带来了柴火，生起火，用旧帽子和自己的斗篷挡住了破烂的窗户。马奇太太把茶和稀粥递给产妇，答应以后常来帮助她们，产妇深感欣慰。马奇太太又轻轻地给宝宝们穿衣服，好像那是亲生骨肉。同时，姑娘们摆好桌子，让孩子们围在炉火边，喂他们吃，就像喂一群饥饿的小鸟。姑娘们又说又笑，费了好大劲才听懂那些滑稽而不标准的英语。

“这太好了！小天使！”可怜的小家伙们边吃边喊，冻得发紫的手伸到火炉边取暖。

姑娘们从未被人称过小天使，感觉非常顺耳。特别是乔，自打出娘胎以来一直被认为是桑丘[1]式的仆人，因而分外得意。早餐什么也没捞到，但感觉很愉快。她们离开了，留下了温暖给别人，我相信，全城都找不到比这四个小姑娘更开心的人。她们自己挨饿，送出早餐，心甘情愿在圣诞节早上只吃面包和牛奶。

“这叫做爱邻人胜于爱自己。我就喜欢这样。”美格说。趁母亲在楼上替可怜的胡梅尔一家翻找衣物，她们把礼物摆了出来。

这次摆放的礼物并不壮观，但小小礼包却寄托了姑娘们深深的爱。高颈的花瓶竖立在桌子中央，里面插满了红玫瑰、白菊花，还有一串蔓藤点缀，桌子上平添了几分雅致。

“来了！贝丝，开始弹！艾美，开门！为妈妈欢呼三声！”乔欢跃着喊道，美格则把妈妈引到上座。

贝丝弹起了最欢快的进行曲，艾美猛地一把推开门，美格则庄严地护送母亲。马奇太太既惊讶又感动，仔细端详礼物、阅读附在上面的字条时，脸上带着笑容，眼里噙满泪水。她立刻穿上军鞋，把散发着艾美买的古龙香水味道的一块新手帕收入口袋，把蔷薇花戴在胸前，还宣布漂亮的手套十分合手。

屋子里一片欢声笑语，大家互相亲吻着，说明着原委。方式简朴，却充满深情，增添了家庭过节的快乐，这种温馨也让人久久难忘。然后，她们又投入了工作。

一早上先是慈善活动，后是赠送仪式，占用了大量时间。剩下的几个小时就只能专门用来准备圣诞夜庆祝了。

姑娘们太小，不可能常去戏院看戏，家里又不是很有钱，请不起剧团上门演出。俗话说，需求是发明之母，于是，她们就开动脑筋，也就因地制宜，土法上马了。她们的某些制作可谓巧夺天工，纸板糊的吉他啦，老式黄油碟包上锡纸充当古董灯罩啦，老棉絮缝制豪华长袍啦，从泡菜工场搞来了马口铁边角料，挂在上面亮闪闪的，盔甲同样利用打罐头盖子的方块边角料覆盖上。家具翻上躺下是常有的事，那个大房间就是演戏的地方，上演过许许多多天真烂漫的欢庆活动。

绅士免入，乔也就尽兴地女扮男装，心满意足地蹬上朋友送的咖啡色皮靴，而朋友是通过一位认识男演员的女士把它曲线搞到手的。这双皮靴、一把钝头旧花剑、画家曾经用来画画的一件开衩马甲，就是乔主要的宝藏，每场必露面。戏班子比较小，所以两个主要演员必须一场次扮演多个角色。煞费苦心地排练三四个不同角色，快速化妆更衣，还要照看舞台，真是难为她们了。这对于记忆力倒是绝佳的操练。无伤大雅的娱乐，占据了大量空闲时间。不然的话，成天无所事事，孤独无聊，就会去找不那么有益的玩伴了。

圣诞夜，十来个姑娘挤上了床，这可算是正厅前排的座位。她们所面对的，是黄蓝相间的印花布帷幕。此刻她们是满心期待，捧场的心情溢于言表。幕后一片窸窸窣窣，窃窃私语，一缕油灯的青烟飘在空中。偶尔还有艾美的笑声，要紧关头总会歇斯底里地发作。此后铃声大作，帷幕快速拉开，“悲剧”开演了。

戏单只有一份，规定阴森森的森林表现为几棵花盆灌木，地上要铺设绿呢地毯，远处有个山洞。山洞以晾衣架为洞顶，几个五斗橱为墙体，有一个火势正旺的小壁炉，上面搁着黑锅子，老女巫俯身伺候着。舞台上黑糊糊的，壁炉的火光效果不错，特别是水壶盖子揭开时，冒出的蒸汽可是货真价实的。留出时间让起初的躁动平息下来，接着反角雨果大摇大摆地上场，腰里别着一把佩剑叮当作响，头戴帽边耷拉的帽子，蓄着黑胡子，披着神秘的斗篷，足蹬皮靴。大动作踱步之后，他拍一下额头，放声乱唱起来，唱他恨罗得里戈，唱他爱莎拉，唱他决意杀死情敌，横刀夺爱。雨果的破嗓门不时为情不自禁的号叫所打断，特别引人入胜。观众一等他停顿换气，便喝彩鼓掌。他以惯受好评的神态鞠了躬，溜到洞穴边，吆喝着“嗨嗬，伙计！我需要汝！”命令海格上台。

美格上，灰色的马鬃挂在面孔两边，披着红黑相间的袍子，拄着拐杖，斗篷上标着神秘教义的符号。雨果索要一杯魔药，要让莎拉爱慕他，再来一杯要灭掉罗得里戈。海格以戏剧旋律歌唱，把两者都答应下来，并且着手呼唤精灵把春药拿来：

来呀来，缥缈仙子！

命汝速速离家！

能酿魔力迷药否？

出自蔷薇，饱承雨露。





快快以精灵的神速，

送来急需的芬芳迷药。

浓郁，速效，强力，

精灵，急急如律令！





轻柔的音乐响起，洞穴深处出现了云白色的小个子，翅膀金光闪闪，金发的脑袋箍着蔷薇花环。它挥舞魔杖，唱道：





我来了，

出自缥缈之家，

银色月亮的地方；

快把魔药拿去，

妥善使用，

以免魔力稍纵即逝！





精灵把金闪闪的小瓶子丢在女巫的脚边，随之消失了。海格再吟一曲，唤来又一个鬼魂——它并不可爱；砰的一声，丑陋的黑小鬼出来了，干咳着应答，给雨果扔了黑瓶子，冷笑着消失了。雨果唱出答谢词，把魔药塞进皮靴，下台。海格告诉观众，雨果曾经杀死了她的几个仙家朋友，而她现在诅咒他是为了复仇，她打算挫败他的计划。落幕了，观众休息，一边吃糖果，一边就戏文品头论足。

好一阵锤打声，幕布没有动。再次开幕时，大家看到舞台木工活是个杰作，也就不肯对开演拖延窃窃私语了。真是鬼斧神工啊。一幢木楼直抵天花板，中间开了窗口，里面点着油灯。白色帷幕后，莎拉身披漂亮的蓝色饰银连衣裙，等待罗得里戈的出现。他一身盛装，帽子插着羽饰，披着红色斗篷，耳边是栗色垂卷绺发式，挎着吉他，皮靴当然少不了。他在木楼底下下跪，以撩人心魄的歌喉唱起了小夜曲。莎拉回应着，来回对唱之后，同意一起私奔。剧情的高潮来了。罗得里戈拿出一副五级绳梯，把一头扔上去，请莎拉下楼。她小心翼翼地从百叶窗里爬下来，搭上了情郎的肩头，准备优雅地跳下来。“哎唷！莎拉真可怜！”她居然忘记自己的裙裾了。裙裾在窗口勾住，木楼摇摇摆摆向前倾，哗地垮塌，把一对怨偶埋在废墟里。

众人尖叫着，只见皮靴从废墟中乱踢出来，金头露面了，一边喊着：“我早就说过的！早就说过的！”残酷的老爷堂彼得罗临危不惧，冲进来拖出女儿，一边匆匆地旁白：

“别笑啦！要装作一切正常！”——他命令罗得里戈站起来，恼羞成怒地判处他流放，不准再回本国。罗得里戈尽管被木楼砸得晕头转向，却不买老绅士的账，身体岿然不动。无所畏惧的榜样令莎拉热血沸腾，她也不买老爷子的账。于是，老爷子下令把两人投入城堡深处的牢狱。矮胖的家丁拿来了锁链，把他们带走，表情惊恐万状，显然忘记了台词。

第三幕是城堡内大厅。海格上，来解救情侣，结果雨果。她听到雨果走近，就躲起来。她看见他把魔药倒入两杯葡萄酒，并命令战战兢兢的下人：“送给牢房的囚犯，告诉他们，我马上到。”下人把雨果拉到一边耳语，海格趁机换掉酒杯，新换上的这两杯无毒。“伙计”费迪南多把酒杯带走，海格就把要给罗得里戈的毒酒放回去。雨果唱久了觉得口渴，便喝下了毒酒，于是头脑错乱，大肆抓捏蹬腿之后，倒地死去了。同时，海格以魔力四射的婉转歌喉，向他揭示了事情的经过。

这确实是激动人心的场面。不过某些人认为，大量长头发突然落地，有损反角死亡的效果。众人喊他来幕前亮相，他便彬彬有礼地出来，还领着海格。大家认为，她的唱腔很了不起，胜过了其他演出加起来的效果。

第四幕表现罗得里戈得知莎拉抛弃了自己，绝望至极，打算自杀。正当匕首刺向心口之际，窗口下面传来迷人的歌声，告诉他莎拉没有变心，但处境危险，如愿意搭救她的话，可以办到。钥匙扔进来了，打开牢门，他欣喜若狂地挣脱锁链，冲出去搜救心上人。

第五幕开始时，莎拉和堂彼得罗剧烈争吵。父亲要求她进修道院，但她坚决不从。催人泪下的恳求不果，她准备晕倒，这时只见罗得里戈闯进来，向她求婚。老爷子不肯，嫌他家境贫寒。他们大声吆喝，指手画脚，难以达成协议。小伙子正打算把精疲力竭的姑娘背走，下人战战兢兢地进来，送来海格的信件和口袋。海格已经神秘失踪，她告诉这帮人，如果老头子让小两口不开心，她就把巨万财产传给他们，并且让老头子不得好死。口袋打开了，成斗的马口铁钱币倾倒在舞台上，一片金光闪闪，富丽堂皇。“古板老爷”见状，彻底回心转意，他毫无怨言地答应了。大家齐声欢唱，有情人以十分浪漫的优雅姿势，跪下接受老爷子的祝福，帷幕落在他们身上。

雷鸣般的掌声响起，却令人意外地戛然而止。“正厅前排”是吊床搭的，突然间卷起，把热情的观众困住了。罗得里戈和堂彼得罗赶快前来救驾，所有人都被拉了出来，毫无损伤，但许多人笑得说不出话来。闹剧尚未结束，汉娜就进来了，宣布道：“马奇太太请客喽，小姐们下楼赴宴！”

真是喜出望外，连这帮喜欢演戏的姑娘也没想到。面对满桌的东西，她们互相看看，又惊又喜。母亲做点吃的款待她们，倒也有可能，但自从告别了富裕的日子，这么好的东西连听都没有听说过。有冰淇淋——共两盘，红的一盘，白的一盘——还有蛋糕、水果和诱人的法国夹心软糖。桌子中央还放着四大束美丽的温室鲜花。

姑娘们别提多惊讶了，看看桌面，又看看母亲。此刻，母亲是满面春风。

“是仙女送来的吗？”艾美问。

“是圣诞老人吧。”贝丝说。

“是妈妈做的。”美格还没卸去演戏用的白胡子白眉毛，脸上露出了最甜美的笑。

“马奇姑婆一时心血来潮，送点心来了。”乔灵机一动喊道。

“你们都错了，是劳伦斯老先生送的。”马奇太太回答说。

“小伙子劳伦斯的爷爷！他怎么会想到的？我们根本不熟悉！”美格大声道。

“汉娜把你们早餐会的事告诉了他家的仆人。他是一位古怪的老绅士，可他听了很高兴。他过去认识你的外公。今天下午，他给我送来一张字条，写得很客气。他说，希望我允许他给孩子们送一些小礼物过节，表达一下他的心意。我想却之不恭，所以你们晚上就有了一顿小小的宴席，弥补面包加牛奶的早餐。”

“肯定是那男孩出的主意。我知道肯定是他！很棒的小伙子，真想认识认识他。他好像也想认识我们的。但他很害羞，美格又一本正经，路上碰到了，也不让我跟他说话。”乔说。姑娘们把盘子递来递去，大嚼冰淇淋，“唏哈唏哈”的吃得津津有味。

“你们说的是不是隔壁大房子里的人？”一位姑娘问，“妈妈认识劳伦斯老先生的，说他很傲慢，不喜欢与邻居来往。他把孙子关在屋子里，逼他用功读书，只是偶尔才让他和家庭教师一起骑马或散步。我们邀请他参加宴会，也没来。妈妈说，男孩为人很好，但从来不跟我们女孩子说话。”

“有一次，我家的猫不见了，是他送回来的。我们隔着篱笆聊天，聊的都是板球一类的东西，而且聊得棒极了——他看到美格过来就走开了。我打算什么时候真正去结识他。他需要开心，我相信他一定需要。”乔斩钉截铁地说。

“他很有礼貌，像一位小绅士，我喜欢。所以我不反对你认识他，要看机会的。他亲自送来了花，我本来应该让进来的，就是不知道你们在楼上干什么。他走的时候听到你们有玩头，好像在想些什么，显然他没什么可玩的。”

“妈妈，幸亏没让他进来！”乔望着自己的靴子，笑着说，“可我们以后会演另一出，那出他就能看了。或许他还会参加演戏呢，那不是很有趣？”

“从来都没见过这么漂亮的花！真是太美了！”美格兴致勃勃地端详着花束。

“这些花真可爱，可是依我看，贝丝送的花更香。”马奇太太说着，闻闻插在腰带上快要枯萎的花朵。

贝丝依偎到母亲身旁，轻轻地说：“希望能把我这束花献给爸爸。恐怕他圣诞节过得没有我们这么快乐吧。”

第三章　劳伦斯家少年


“乔！乔！你在哪儿？”美格在阁楼的楼梯底下喊。

“这里！”上面传来沙哑的声音。美格爬上去，发现妹妹坐在朝阳的窗口旁边一个三脚沙发上面，裹着被子，一边吃苹果，一边对着《拉德克利夫继承人》哭泣。这里是乔最喜欢的藏身处，她喜欢带上三五个粗皮苹果、一本好书躲起来，静静地享用，跟她做伴的是住在附近、根本不顾忌她的一只宠物老鼠。美格一露面，“抓扒”嗖的一声进洞了。乔摇头甩去脸上的眼泪，准备听消息。

“真开心！快看！请柬，加德纳太太正式邀请我们参加明晚的舞会！”美格边喊，边挥动着珍贵的纸条，然后满怀少女的喜悦读了起来。

“‘加德纳太太诚邀马奇小姐和约瑟芬小姐参加除夕小聚会。’妈咪同意我们去，可是穿什么衣服呢？”

“问这干吗？你知道只能穿府绸衣服去，没衣服穿嘛。”乔答道，满嘴嚼着苹果。

“要是有丝绸服装该多好！”美格叹息着，“妈妈说，我到了十八就可以穿了。还要等上整整两年，真是望眼欲穿。”

“我敢说，我们的府绸跟丝绸也差不多，已经够好的啦。你的那件保护得跟新的一样，可我忘记了，我那件烧了洞，还有扯坏的地方。我该怎么办？火烧洞太显眼，挖都挖不掉。”

“你必须尽量安静地坐好了，别让人看见后背。正面没问题的。我要用新丝带扎头发，妈咪会把她的珍珠发卡借给我；新鞋子很可爱，手套不够称心，但还凑合。”

“我的手套沾上了柠檬水，又没有新的换，只能不戴了。”乔说。她从来都不为穿戴发愁的。

“手套一定要戴的，否则我不去，”美格斩钉截铁地诈唬，“手套可是头等大事。要是你不戴，我就太丢面子了。”

“那我就不挪动好了。我不怎么喜欢交谊舞。游来游去没情绪，我喜欢的是东跑西蹿开玩笑。”

“不能跟妈妈要新的，太贵了，你又不爱惜。你那副弄脏时，她就说，今年不会替你买了。你就不能将就一下？”美格焦虑地问。

“可以把手套捏在手里，不让人看见脏的地方。只能这么办了。噢！我看这么应付吧——每人戴一只好手套，捏一只坏手套。懂了吗？”

“你的手比我大，会把我的手套撑坏的。”美格发飙了，手套是动不得的。

“那我就不戴。才不在乎别人说话呢！”乔诈唬着捧起了书本。

“给你给你，好了吧！就是不要弄脏了，要规矩一点。不要反背双手，不要瞪眼，不要喊‘怪怪’，好不好？”

“别替我担心。我尽量守规矩，竭尽全力不去惹是生非。去回复你的请柬吧，我要看完这个精彩的故事。”

美格下去写“欣然应邀，感谢美意”，打点服饰了。她一边给自己打着真正的荷叶花边，一边轻松地唱着歌。而乔看完了小说，吃完了四个苹果，还同“抓扒”嬉闹了一番。

除夕那天，客厅空荡荡的。两个姐姐忙于“预备出客”的头等大事，两个小妹妹则在侍候穿衣。尽管行头很简单，但她们跑上跑下，有说有笑，不亦乐乎。头发烧焦的浓烈味道还一度弥漫了整座屋子。美格希望两鬓来几缕鬈发，乔随之给头发包了油纸，用烧红的火钳夹紧了来凑合。

“头发应该这样浓烟滚滚的吗？”趴在床上的贝丝问。

“是湿发在烤干哪。”乔答道。

“什么怪味道！就像羽毛烧起来了。”艾美一边顾盼自雄地整理自己的秀美鬈发，一边说。

“好了，我这就撕掉油纸，马上可以看到云卷鬈发的。”乔放下火钳道。

她果然撕掉了油纸，却并没有出现云卷鬈发。头发随着油纸脱落了，发型师大惊失色，把一排烧焦的小卷卷放在五斗橱上，受害者的眼前。

“哎哟哟！你怎么了你？我完了！去不成了！我的头发哟，我的头发！”美格哀号着，绝望地瞪着额头上高低不平的鬈发。

“我真倒霉！不该求我烫头发的。我总是把事情搞砸。对不起，火钳太烫了，所以搞得一团糟。”可怜的乔呻吟道，望着黑黑的小饼饼鬈发，悔恨的泪水滚落下来。

“没有完呀！只是弄卷曲了，扎丝带的时候，让发梢往额头飘一点就行，而且样子还很时髦呢。我见过很多姑娘梳这样的头。”艾美安慰道。

“我瞎讲究，活该倒霉。情愿不打理那头发的啊！”美格怒气冲冲地吆喝着。

“我也这样想的。头发本来滑溜，多么漂亮啊。但很快会长出来的。”贝丝走过来亲吻安抚剃了毛的绵羊。

又出了几个小岔子之后，美格终于打扮齐整了。经过全家人的齐心协力，乔的头发也梳好了，连衣裙穿好了。她们装束俭朴，却十分秀丽。美格一身银闪闪的黄褐色衣服，蓝色天鹅绒的束发带，荷叶花边，珍珠发卡。乔的衣服是枣红色的，绅士风度的亚麻布硬领子，一两朵白菊花是唯一的点缀。各人戴了一只好的薄手套，手里拿着一只脏手套。大家众口一词，这很有“轻松雅致”的效果。美格的高跟鞋很紧，夹痛了脚，但她不承认。乔的十九个发卡仿佛都直刺在脑袋上，并不怎么舒服，可是，哎唷，不漂亮，毋宁死！

“祝玩得开心，小宝贝！”马奇太太对姐妹俩说。她们走上小路，姿势颇为讲究。“晚饭不要吃得太多，十一点回来，到时候，会让汉娜去接的。”她们出门后，大门砰地关上。就在此时，窗口的声音喊着：

“孩子！孩子！你们俩带漂亮手帕了吗？”

“带了，带了，棒极了。美格的手帕还喷了古龙香水呢。”乔喊道。走几步，她又笑着补充道：“我确信，哪怕地震来了，大家抱头鼠窜，妈咪也会这样询问的啊。”

“这是她的贵族趣味嘛，十分得体的。真正的淑女总是皮靴贼亮，手套洁白，手帕香喷喷的。”美格答道，她自己也有不少贵族趣味呢。

“不要忘记了，衣服上那处毛病别让人看到，乔。我的腰带合适吗？头发还可以吧？”美格在加德纳太太梳妆室的镜子前反复打扮，良久才转身过来。

“能不忘记嘛！要是看到我有不对的地方，眨眨眼提醒我好吗？”乔答道。她拉了拉领子，用梳子撸了一下头发。

“不行，淑女怎么能眨眼呢？要是有不对的地方，我就扬眉毛，没关系就点头。好了，肩膀挺直，脚步要小。主人做介绍时，不要乱握手，这是万万不能做的。”

“你是怎么学会所有这些规矩的？我就学不会。那音乐是不是很轻快呀？”

她们平时很少参加舞会，下楼时有点羞怯。聚会不算正式，对她们来说却是件大事。加德纳太太是一位神情庄重的老太太，膝下有六位姑娘。她热情地接待她们，然后将她们引见给了大女儿。美格认识萨莉，举止很快就恢复了自然。但是，乔对女孩和女孩间的闲聊向来不太在意，她到处站站，小心翼翼地背靠着墙，就像一匹被关在花园里的马驹，感到浑身不自在。屋子的另一边有五六个小伙子，开心地谈论着溜冰，她想过去一起聊，因为溜冰是她人生的一大快事。她把心愿远距离传递给美格，但美格把眉头抬得老高，她就不敢擅自走动了。没有人过来跟她说话，身旁的人群也一个个走开了，最后只剩下她一个人。她担心烧坏的衣服被人看见，不敢四处走动玩耍，只能可怜巴巴地盯着人群，自己打发时光，直到跳舞开始。立刻就有人邀请美格跳舞，她面带笑容，舞步轻盈，但是没人会想到她鞋子太紧，在暗中吃苦。乔看到一位红头发的大个子小伙朝她的角落走来，唯恐他来邀舞，便溜进了挂着门帘的休息室，想偷偷观看，一个人悄悄地自娱自乐。不巧，已经有一个害羞的人选择了同样的避难所。当门帘在她身后落下时，乔发现自己正与劳伦斯家少年面面相觑。

“天哪！我还以为没人在这儿！”乔结结巴巴地说，准备飞快地退出去，正如她飞快地冲进来。

但是，男孩大声地笑了，虽然看上去有一点吃惊，但还是高兴地说：

“不用管我，想待就待着吧！”

“不会打扰你吧？”

“一点都不会。要知道，很多人我都不认识，才躲进这儿来的，起初的感觉特不自然。”

“我也是。请别走，除非你真的想离开。”

小伙子又坐下了，看着脚上的轻软跳舞皮鞋。这时，乔开口了，她努力做到自然而有礼貌：

“我想以前幸会过的。先生住在我家附近，对吧？”

“就在隔壁。”他抬起头，率直地笑了，因为乔一本正经的样子颇为滑稽。这时，他想起了把猫送回她家时，他们谈论板球的情形。

这就打破了乔的拘谨。她也笑了，并用最诚挚的语气说：

“你送来的圣诞礼物，我们开心了一阵子。”

“是爷爷送的。”

“嗨，是你想出来的，对吧？”

“你家的猫怎么样了，马奇小姐？”男孩问，努力装出一副严肃的样子，但黑眼睛却闪着调皮的神情。

“很好的，谢谢。劳伦斯先生。不过，我不是马奇小姐，叫我乔就行了。”小姑娘答道。

“我也不是劳伦斯先生，叫我劳里就行了。”

“劳里·劳伦斯——这名字真怪！”

“我名叫西奥多，可我不喜欢，因为伙伴们都叫我多拉，女人的名字，所以让他们改叫劳里。”

“我也不喜欢自己的名字——多伤感！希望大家都叫我乔，而不是约瑟芬。你是怎样才让那些男孩不叫你多拉的？”

“揍他们。”

“我可不能打马奇姑婆，所以只好随她这么叫了。”乔无可奈何地叹了口气。

“你喜欢舞会吗？”过了一会儿，她问。

“难道你不喜欢跳舞吗，乔小姐？”劳里问，似乎觉得这个称呼挺适合她的。

“要是场地大，人人都很活跃的话，我倒喜欢跳的。可像这样的地方，我总要打翻点东西，免不了踩人家的脚指头，或者出洋相。所以就不去胡闹，让美格去跳吧。你也不跳吗？”

“有时候跳。要知道，我在国外待了很多年，这儿我朋友还不多，还不清楚你们这儿的习惯。”

“国外，”乔喊道，“哦，快跟我讲讲！我很喜欢听别人讲他们行万里路的。”

劳里似乎不知道从哪里讲起，可是乔问得很急切，很快他便讲开了。他告诉她瑞士韦威的学校生活。在那里，男孩们从来不戴帽子，却在湖上有一批小船，假期里他们跟老师步行到瑞士各地野营。

“多想去一趟啊！”乔大声说，“去巴黎了吗？”

“去年寒假就在那里度过的。”

“会说法语吗？”

“在韦威只许讲法语的。”

“那说说看！我能看，不能说。”

“Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis? ”劳里亲切地说。

“讲得真不错！我想想——你是说‘穿漂亮鞋子的那个女孩叫什么？’是不是啊？”

“Oui, mademoiselle。”[1]

“她是我姐姐，玛格丽特，你早就知道的！你看她漂亮吗？”

“漂亮。使我想起德国姑娘，清新、文静。跳的舞像淑女。”

听到对姐姐进行男孩子气的赞美，乔高兴得脸上放光。她暗暗记下这话，准备回去说给美格听。两人在幕后边看边评论，一聊就聊成了老友重逢。劳里脸上的害羞神情也烟消云散，乔的男儿风度使他感到心情畅快；乔自己也恢复了乐呵呵的本性，忘了烧坏的衣服，也没人对她抬眉头了。她更加喜欢劳伦斯家少年了，要仔细地打量他几次，准备回家向姐妹们描述一番。她们家既没有兄弟，表兄、堂兄也不多，所以与男孩子很少接触。

“黑色的鬈头发，棕色的皮肤，又黑又大的眼睛，秀气的鼻子，整齐的牙齿。手脚都不大，个子要比我高一点，男孩子这么温文尔雅又开朗。不知道他有多大了？”

乔刚开口想问，却又及时收了口，显出了少有的老练，试图旁敲侧击。

“我猜，你很快就要上大学了吧？我看你老是在啃书本——不，我是说你用功学习。”乔为那个冒失的“啃”字脱口而出而脸上发烧。

劳里笑了笑，似乎并不感到惊讶。他耸耸肩，回答道：

“还有一两年呢。反正，不到十七岁，我是不会去上大学的。”

“难道你只有十五吗？”乔看着这位高大的小伙子问，本来以为他已经十七了。

“下个月才满十六。”

“我多想上大学！看来你并不喜欢。”

“我讨厌上大学。不是埋头啃书，就是到处闲荡。再说，我也不喜欢美国青年的生活方式。”

“那你喜欢什么呢？”

“喜欢住在意大利，以自己的方式快活。”

乔很想问问，他自己的生活方式是怎样的，但他紧锁双眉，显得十分可怕。于是，她转换了话题，一边用脚打着节拍，一边说：“那首波尔卡舞曲真是棒极了！你为什么不去试试呢？”

“要是你也一起来的话，我就去。”他回答时，微微地鞠了一躬，显得颇有风度。

“我不行，我答应过美格不跳舞，因为——”乔欲言又止，似乎在犹豫，不知道是说出真相呢，还是一笑了之。

“为什么？”劳里好奇地问。

“你不会说出去的吧？”

“绝对不会！”

“那好，我有个坏习惯，老是站在火炉边上，所以经常烧坏衣服，这件衣服我也烧焦了，虽然补得很好，可还是看得出来。美格让我待着别动，这样就没人会看到了。要是你想笑就笑好了，我知道这很滑稽。”

劳里并没有笑，只低一下头。他轻声说话，表情使乔感到疑惑不解，“别管它。告诉你，我们可以跳舞。那边有一条长长的走廊，我们可以尽情地跳，没人会看到。来吧？”

乔谢了，欣然跟过去。看到舞伴戴着漂亮的珍珠色手套，她真希望自己也有一副干净的手套。走廊里空荡荡的，他们尽情地跳了一曲波尔卡。劳里舞跳得很不错，还教乔跳德国舞步；这种舞步充满了旋转和跳动，乔非常喜欢。一曲终了，他们在楼梯口坐下喘气。劳里正在讲德国海德堡的学生联欢活动时，美格过来找妹妹。她招招手，乔不情愿地跟着美格走进一间侧屋，只见她坐到沙发上，手抱着脚，脸色苍白。

“脚踝扭了。该死的高跟鞋一歪，把我狠狠地扭了一下。痛得要命，差一点就站不住了，真不知道该怎么回家。”她痛得直摇晃。

“我早就知道，穿那双笨鞋，会把脚扭伤的。替你难过。我想现在也没法子，只能叫辆马车，要不就在这儿过夜。”乔说着，一边轻轻地揉那可怜的脚踝。

“叫马车要不少钱，我敢说，现在是叫不到的。大多数人都是乘私家马车来的，要走很远才能叫到车，再说也没人去叫。”

“我去。”

“不要，千万别去！都晚上九点多了，外面又黑灯瞎火的。不能留宿在这儿，屋子里客人住满了。主人有几个女友留下过夜，我想先休息一下，等汉娜来了再尽力而为吧。”

“我去找劳里，他会去的。”乔一想到这个主意，就显得如释重负。

“求你了，别去！别找人，也不要跟人说。把我的胶鞋拿过来，把这双舞鞋放到我们的包里去。不能跳舞了，晚饭一吃完，就等着汉娜来。她一来就告诉我。”

“他们现在要去吃晚饭，我会陪着你的，我愿意陪着。”

“不，乖乖，快去，替我拿些咖啡来。我累得要命，动都动不了！”

说完，美格斜靠在沙发上，刚好遮住了胶鞋。乔跌跌撞撞地朝餐厅走去。她先闯进一间放瓷器的储藏室，接着又打开一扇门，却发现加德纳老先生在那里独自小憩，最后才来到餐厅。她冲向餐桌，拿到了咖啡，慌乱中又泼了，弄得衣服前胸跟后背一样糟糕。

“哦，天哪，我真笨！”乔惊叫一声，赶忙用美格的手套擦衣服，却又毁了手套。

“可以帮你吗？”传来一个友好的声音。是劳里，他一手拿着盛满咖啡的杯子，一手拿着冰淇淋盘子。

“我要给美格拿点吃的，她很累。不知谁撞了我一下，就成了这好模样。”乔回答说。她看看满是污渍的裙子，又看看咖啡色的手套，显得十分沮丧。

“太可惜了！我正要找个人，把手里的这份东西给送出去。可以拿给你姐吗？”

“那就谢啦！我带路。东西我不想拿，否则，肯定又会惹事的。”

乔带路，劳里好像是惯于为女士效劳的，他拉过一张小桌子，又为乔拿来一份咖啡和冰淇淋，十分殷勤周到，连挑剔的美格都称他是个“好小伙子”。他们边吃糖果，边谈论糖纸上的格言，过得很愉快。正当他们与另外两三个刚溜达进来的年轻人安静地玩《闲话》上的文字游戏时，汉娜来了。美格忘记了脚痛，猛地站起来，痛得叫了一声，赶紧抓住乔。

“嘘！什么也别说。”她小声跟乔嘀咕，接着又大声地说，“没什么，我脚扭了一下，没事。”然后，她一瘸一拐地走到楼上穿外套。

汉娜责怪，美格痛哭。乔不知所措，最后决定自作主张。她偷偷地溜了出来，飞快地跑下楼，找到了仆人，问他是否能为她找一辆马车。碰巧这人是雇来的侍者，对邻里环境也是一无所知。乔正在找人帮忙，劳里闻讯走了过来，告诉她，爷爷的马车刚到，是来接他的，她们可以搭他的马车回家。

“现在还那么早呢！你还不会走吧？”乔说，如释重负，可还在犹豫客套着。

“我回家都较早。很早，真的！请让我送你们回家吧。你知道的，我也是顺路，听说还下雨了呢。”

问题解决了。乔告知美格的麻烦，满心感激地接受了援助，然后飞快地跑上楼接其他人。汉娜像猫一样对下雨深恶痛绝，所以并没有发难。他们乘着豪华的封闭式马车回家了，觉得十分高雅，非常愉快。劳里和车夫坐到驾驶座，让美格把脚搁起来，姑娘们无拘无束地谈论着舞会的情景。

“我真是太开心了，你呢？”乔一边问，一边把头发弄蓬松，使自己放松。

“我也是，可那是在扭伤脚以前。萨莉的朋友安妮·莫法特和我交上了朋友，萨莉去她家的时候，要我一起去住上一个礼拜。萨莉开春时去，那时歌剧正好上演。如果妈妈同意我去的话，真是太好了。”美格回答说。一想到这个，她就兴奋起来。

“我看到你和红头发的小伙子在一起跳舞，就是我躲开的那个。他人好吗？”

“哦，好极！他的头发是赤褐色，不是红色。很有礼貌的。我还跟他跳了一曲雷多瓦捷克舞呢。”

“他跳新舞步的样子很像发情的蚱蜢，劳里和我都禁不住笑了。你听到笑声了吗？”

“没有，这样做很没礼貌。你整个晚上躲在那里干什么了？”

乔讲了自己的奇遇，等她讲完，已经到家了。她们万分感激地跟劳里道“晚安”，然后摸进屋里，希望能不打扰任何人。但随着门嘎吱地打开，跳出两个戴着睡帽的小脑袋，两个睡意蒙眬的声音兴奋地喊道：

“讲讲舞会！讲讲舞会！”

乔还特地为小妹妹们藏起了几颗糖果，尽管美格认为这样极不礼貌。听了整个晚上最尽兴的事，她们很快就安静下来。

“我敢说，真像当了一回娇小姐，居然舞会散场后坐马车回家，穿着礼服，旁边还有侍女伺候着。”美格说。乔正在用山金车酊止痛药包扎她的脚，并且替她梳头。

“想来娇小姐享福也不过如此了，尽管我们头发烧焦，礼服破旧，手套落单。鞋子太紧，还傻乎乎穿着去跳舞，不扭伤脚才怪呢。”我看乔说得一点没错。

第四章　负担


“唉，天哪，又得背上包袱往前走，真难哪！”舞会后第二天早上，美格叹息道。假期已经结束，尽情享受了一个礼拜，又要做不喜欢做的工作，不容易适应。

“希望天天都是圣诞节或元旦，那样是不是会很来劲？”乔说着沮丧地打了个哈欠。

“我们能像现在这样享福，应该知足了。可要是能吃夜宵、买鲜花、参加舞会、乘马车回家、看看书、休息休息，又不用工作，那真是太好了。要知道，有些人过的就是这种生活，我常常羡慕那些姑娘，她们的日子可舒坦着呢。我真的喜欢享受。”美格说。她正在设法辨别两件破旧的衣服中哪件尚可一穿。

“哎，这种生活我们是过不上啰。那就不要再抱怨了，我们要像妈咪那样，乐观地背起包袱，继续向前。我知道，姑婆是个十足的累赘，‘海之老人’[1]，但如果能学会容忍她，不抱怨，这个负担就会自动卸掉，或者轻松起来，这差事也就变得不在话下了。”

乔觉得这个主意挺好玩的，心情豁然开朗。但美格却一点都开心不起来，她要照看四个娇生惯养的孩子，担子显得比以前任何时候都要重。平常她会围上一条蓝丝巾，然后把头发梳得美丽动人。可现在，她连梳妆打扮的心思都没有了。

“漂亮有什么用？除了那些调皮的小鬼，没人会看我，也没人会关心我是不是漂亮。”她咕哝着，猛地关上抽屉，“我得没日没夜地辛苦，偶尔才有一点点开心。我变得又老又丑，变得尖酸刻薄，就是因为我穷，不能和平常姑娘一样享受生活。真遗憾！”

美格下楼去了，一脸很受伤的样子，吃早餐时脾气不好。大家似乎都很懊恼，喜欢无病呻吟。贝丝头痛，便躺在沙发上，跟猫儿和三只小猫相互安慰。艾美功课学不会，气急败坏的，橡皮也找不到了。乔不停地吹口哨，准备工作闹出很多动静。马奇太太忙着给一封信收尾，必须马上寄出去的。汉娜脾气不好，她不适应熬夜的。

“一家人如此怒气冲冲，这是前所未有的！”乔大声说。她撞翻了墨水台，两根鞋带都拉断了，还坐到了帽子上，便发了脾气。

“怒气冲冲，你最厉害！”艾美回嘴道。她借着掉在石板上的眼泪刷去算错的题目。

“贝丝，假如你不把这些凶猫关到地下室里去的话，我就把它们统统淹死。”美格恶狠狠地恐吓着。一只小猫儿爬到她背脊上，就像树瘤一样粘在上面，却够不到。她拼命要甩掉它。

乔笑了，美格骂骂咧咧的，贝丝恳求开恩，艾美哀叫着，因为她不记得九乘以十二等于几。

“姑娘们，姑娘们，快静一下！我必须赶早班邮车把这个寄出去的。你们的烦恼使我分心啊。”马奇太太大声说。她已经在信中划掉第三个写错的句子了。

暂时静下来了，这平静却被汉娜打破了。她冲进来，把两个热酥饼放到桌上后，又走了出去。做酥饼成了定式，姑娘们称之为“火笼”。早晨寒冷，她们没有真正的火笼，却发现热酥饼完全可以焐手。汉娜不管家务多么忙碌，自己有多么委屈，一天不落地做酥饼，因为路途漫长，走路时又冷森森的。可怜的姑娘们没有专门备午餐，而且很少有两点以前回家的。

“抱好你的猫儿，头痛快点好，贝丝。再见，妈咪。今天早上，我们成了一窝坏蛋，但回家的时候会成为正宗天使的。走吧，美格！”乔上路了，觉得朝圣者没有按照要求出发。

拐弯前，她们总是回头看看，母亲总会靠在窗口点头微笑，朝她俩挥手。她们似乎觉得，不这样做，一天就无法踏实。不管心情如何，最后看一眼慈母的脸庞，她们肯定会如沐春风。

“假如妈咪对我们挥拳头，而不是飞吻，那也是自作自受。世上再没有比我们更加忘恩负义的浑蛋了。”乔大声说。她在雪地里跋涉，寒风凛冽，却感到了赎罪的欣慰。

“不要使用这么可怕的说法嘛。”美格从面纱深处搭话。她活像厌世的修女，把脑袋裹得严严实实的。

“我喜欢意味深长的强烈的良性措辞。”乔答道。帽子被风吹起，差一点从脑袋上飞走，她赶紧抓住。

“随便你怎么骂自己，我可不是坏蛋，也不是浑蛋。我不愿意这样挨骂。”

“你是个落魄鬼，今天的脾气绝对差，因为不能一直养尊处优。可怜乖乖，就等我发财吧，保证你日子好过，有马车坐，有冰淇淋吃，有高跟鞋穿，有花束装饰，舞会时尽遇到赤发小伙子。”

“乔，你真是滑稽可笑！”美格对这无稽之谈一笑置之，心里却不由自主地好过了起来。

“我滑稽是你的福气呢。要是我跟你一样垂头丧气，只顾消沉下去，就有我们好看的啦。谢天谢地，我总是能找乐子振作自己。不要再抱怨了，回家时要兴高采烈。听话啊。”

两人分手时，乔鼓劲地拍拍姐姐的肩膀。她们上了不同的道路，各自用热酥饼焐着手，尽可能开心一点，尽管天气奇寒，工作辛苦，年轻人的享乐欲望却无法满足。

马奇先生为了帮助一位倒霉朋友而葬送了家产，当时，两个大女儿请求做点什么，至少她们可以自食其力。考虑到要尽早培养她们的干劲、勤劳和独立精神，父母答应了。于是，两人满怀热情地投入了工作。尽管障碍重重，但有志者事竟成。玛格丽特找了一份幼儿家教的工作，工资微薄，她却感到十分富足。正如她所说，她喜欢享受，而她的主要问题是贫穷。她比妹妹们更难忍受贫穷，因为她还记得过去，那时家里漂亮，无所不有，生活无忧无虑，充满欢乐。她努力做到不羡慕别人，对生活知足，可毕竟年轻姑娘爱美，渴望交乐天的朋友，祈求学习才艺，过上幸福生活，这些都是她们的天性。由于她为之工作的金家孩子们的姐姐都刚刚到能参加社交活动的年龄，她天天都看到自己想要的一切。美格经常能瞥见做工考究的舞会礼服和鲜花，能听到有关戏剧、音乐会和雪橇比赛、各种娱乐活动的热烈讨论，看到钱都浪费在一些琐事上，可对她来说这些钱是多么宝贵。美格安贫乐道，可有时心中不平，难免愤世嫉俗。她还不知道，自己其实多么富有，拥有很多祝福，而唯有这才能带来幸福生活。

马奇姑婆脚有点瘸，需要一个手脚勤快的人来服侍，乔碰巧合了她的心意。家里破产时，这位膝下无子的老太太想要过继其中的一位姑娘。要求遭到了拒绝，她极为恼火。朋友们告诉马奇夫妇，他们本来可以被列入阔老太太的遗嘱，但机会已经失之交臂。可是，漠视钱财的马奇夫妇只是说：

“就是给金山银山，我们也不会抛弃自家女儿。不管有没有钱，我们死活都要在一起，共享天伦之乐。”

有一段时间，老太太都不愿理他们，但她在朋友家碰到了乔。乔滑稽的脸庞和率直的举止打动了老太太的心，因此她提出要花钱雇乔跟她做个伴。乔心里根本不乐意，由于没有更好的差事，便应下了这份差事。令人称奇的是，乔与这位性情暴躁的亲戚相处得特别好。偶尔也会遇到暴风骤雨，乔一次还扬长而去回了家，并宣布再也忍受不下去了。但姑婆很快就收拾残局，急忙派人把她请回去，使她不好意思拒绝，因为她在心底里还是挺喜欢这位火性子的老太太。

我想，真正吸引她的，还是那一大屋子好书。自从马奇姑祖父去世以后，那里积满了灰尘和蜘蛛网。乔还记得和蔼可亲的老先生，他以前让乔用他的大字典搭铁路和桥梁，给她讲拉丁文书籍中古怪插图的故事，每次在街上碰见乔，还要为她买几块姜饼。房间里光线暗淡，积满了灰尘，高高的书架上，几尊半身像俯视着下面，那里还有几张舒适的椅子和几个地球仪。最妙的要数五花八门的书，乔可以随意翻阅，把藏书室当成她的乐园。姑婆打盹或忙着和别人闲聊时，乔就赶忙来到这个清静之地，蜷曲在安乐椅上，贪婪地阅读诗歌、小说、历史、游记和画册，宛如十足的蛀书虫。但是，快乐事往往不能长久。每当她看到故事的精彩之处，读到最优美的诗行，或者旅行家最危险的冒险经历时，总有一个声音尖叫：“约瑟——芬！约瑟——芬！”这时她便不得不离开她的天堂，出去绕纱线，给狮子狗洗澡，或者朗读贝尔沙的《散文集》，一忙就是几个钟头。

乔的志向是创一番伟大的事业。到底是什么事业心中还没数，只等着时光来告诉她。同时，她发现自己最大的苦恼是不能尽兴读书，不能跑步骑马。脾气暴躁、说话尖刻、坐立不安常使她陷入困境，也注定了她的生活充满酸甜苦辣，悲喜交加。但她在姑婆家的锻炼很有必要，虽然老太太没完没了地叫“约瑟——芬”，一想到自己做事能维持生计，乔就开心起来。

贝丝由于太害羞没去上学。她也曾试着上过学，但受不了那种痛苦，于是就辍学，在家里跟爸爸学习。后来，爸爸走了，妈妈也响应号召为“战士援助社”出力干活，即使在这种时候，贝丝仍然始终如一，尽最大努力坚持自学。她这个小姑娘颇像一位家庭主妇，帮汉娜把家里操持得井井有条，使出门挣钱的人过得舒舒服服。她从来不图回报，只想着有爱就满足了。她度过了漫长而默默无闻的日子，却从不感到孤独和无聊，因为在她的小世界里，到处是幻想中的朋友，而且她天生就是劳碌命。贝丝还是个孩子，仍然非常喜欢宠物，每天早上她都要抱上六个布娃娃，替它们穿衣服。布娃娃没有一个四肢完整，也没有一个漂亮的，在贝丝收留它们之前，都是弃儿。姐姐们长大了不再喜欢这些玩具，而这些又旧又丑的东西艾美是不会要的，于是就传给了她。正因为如此，贝丝格外珍惜这些娃娃，还为几个病宝宝设立了医院。她一丝不苟地给它们喂饭、穿衣、爱抚，从不用针去刺它们棉花身体的要害，从不打骂，即使对最讨厌的玩具也不冷落欺凌，始终一视同仁。

一个被遗弃的“宝贝”，破破烂烂，四肢不全，以前是乔的，过的是狂风暴雨般的生活，最后被遗弃在一个杂物袋子里，贝丝把它从这个沉闷的穷酸袋中拯救出来，放在她的避难所里。头顶不见了，她就扎上一顶漂亮的小帽子；四肢也没了，她就用毯子把它包起来，掩盖了这些缺陷；并给这位长期卧床的病人安排了一张最好的床。如果有人知道贝丝是如何细心照料这个娃娃的，想必他们即使哈哈大笑，也肯定会被她的真情所打动。她给它送鲜花；她为它朗读书报，裹在大衣里带出去透新鲜空气；她为它唱摇篮曲，每次上床总要先吻一下那脏兮兮的脸，并柔声细语：“祝你晚安，可怜的宝贝。”

贝丝和姐妹们一样，也有自己的烦恼。毕竟她不是天使，只是一个人间的小姑娘。正如乔所说，她经常掉眼泪，因为上不了音乐课，也没有一架像样的钢琴。她酷爱音乐，用功学习，耐心地在那架叮当作响的旧钢琴上练习，似乎应该有人（不是指姑婆）帮帮她的。可是没人帮她，贝丝独自练琴时，面对五音不全的钢琴潸然泪下，却没人看见她把眼泪从发黄的琴键上悄悄擦去。她像一只小云雀，歌唱着自己的工作，为妈妈和姐妹们演唱时也从不觉得累。每天她总是满怀希望地对自己说：“我知道，只要我乖，总有一天会学好音乐的。”

世界上有很多个贝丝，腼腆文静，待在角落里，直到需要时才挺身而出。她们开心地为别人活着，没人留意她们所做出的牺牲。最后，炉边小蟋蟀停止了鸣叫，阳光般温暖的脸庞消逝，只留下了寂静和阴影。

如果有人问艾美，生活中最大的磨难是什么，她马上会回答：“我的鼻子。”当她还是婴儿时，乔一次意外失手把她摔落在煤斗里。艾美坚持认为，这一摔永远毁掉了她的鼻子。鼻子不大也不红，不像可怜的“彼得利亚”[2]的鼻子；只是有点扁，无论怎样捏也捏不出个贵族式的鼻尖。除了她自己谁都不在乎这个，鼻子在拼命地长，但是艾美非常希望她的鼻子能挺直一点，于是便画了整张整张的漂亮鼻子聊以自慰。

“小拉斐尔[3]”——姐姐们都这样叫她，她无疑具有画画的天赋。她最大的幸福莫过于描摹花朵，设计仙女，用古怪的艺术形象为小说画插图。老师们抱怨说，她的写字石板不是用来做加法的，而是画满了动物，地图册空白的页面上也临摹满了地图。她所有的书本，一不小心就会掉出一组组滑稽的漫画。她尽量在各门功课上取得好的成绩，作为品德模范，屡屡躲过惩罚。她脾气好，能轻易取悦别人，深受同学喜爱。她的举止、风度备受仰慕，而且多才多艺，有绘画特长，还能弹十二个曲子，能用钩针编织，读法语读错的词不超过三分之二。她常常悲伤地说：“爸爸有钱的时候，我们是如何如何。”真是很动人。她说话时喜欢用长单词，被女同学们认为是“优雅无比”。

艾美差不多被大伙儿宠坏了，都把她当成宝贝，她的虚荣和自私也在迅速膨胀。然而，有一件事却打击了她的虚荣心。她只能穿表姐穿过的旧衣服。表姐弗洛伦斯的妈妈没有一点品味，艾美喜欢戴蓝帽子，却只有红帽子，衣服和围裙也难看花哨不合身，真是痛苦。其实，她穿的每一件衣服都不错，做工考究，几乎看不出是穿过的，但艾美颇具艺术性的眼光却不能忍受它们，特别是今年冬天，她上学穿的衣服是暗紫色的，上面尽是黄点，又没有花边装饰。

“我唯一的安慰是，”她眼里噙着泪水对美格说，“不听话的时候，妈妈没有像玛丽亚·帕克的妈妈那样，把我的裙子折起来。哎，那可真是糟糕透顶。有时她太调皮了，连衣裙被卷到了膝盖上，连学校都不能去了。每当我想到这种痴（耻）辱，就觉得扁鼻子和上面印有黄色焰火的紫衣算不了什么了。”

美格是艾美的知心朋友，也是她的监督人。也许是性格上异性相吸的缘故，乔和乖巧的贝丝配对。害羞的小女孩只跟乔倾诉心事，对她这位高大、冒失的姐姐，不知不觉，贝丝的影响比家中任何人都要大。两位大姐姐之间十分要好，每人又都照料着一个妹妹，并以各自的方式照管着她们。她们称之为“长姐为母”。她们用妹妹代替丢弃的娃娃，如同小妇人一般，充满母爱，对妹妹呵护有加。

“有人说故事吗？今天太无聊了，迫切需要来一点娱乐。”美格说。那天晚上，姐妹们坐在一起做缝纫。

“今天，我跟姑婆度过的时光十分古怪。我占了上风，就跟你们说说吧。”乔开口了。她可喜欢讲故事了。“我在朗读那本永远读不完的贝尔沙散文，跟平常一样越读越含混，反正姑婆很快就打瞌睡了。然后，我可以取出好书拼命看，直到她醒过来。今天我自己也搞得昏昏欲睡了，她还没有倒头睡去，我却打了个大哈欠，所以她问我，嘴巴张得老大，可以吞下整本书了，这是什么意思嘛？

“‘但愿能够吞下去，一劳永逸，岂不更好。’我尽量和颜悦色地回道。

“这下，她不厌其烦地数落起我的罪孽，并且命令我坐着反省，而她只是稍许‘眯瞪’一下。她从来都不会很快醒来的，所以她的帽子一开始像头重脚轻的大丽花一样摇曳，我就从口袋里抽出《威克菲尔德的牧师》，大肆阅读，一只眼看书，一只眼盯着姑婆。刚刚看到他们统统滚进水里，我就忘乎所以，大声笑了出来。姑婆惊醒，打盹以后，脾气也好了。她命令我朗读几段来听听，看看我喜欢什么样的轻薄作品，居然胜过了教益良深的贝尔沙宝书。我全力以赴，她很喜欢听的，但嘴里只是说：

“‘听不懂，到底讲什么内容啊。倒回去，从头开始，孩子。’

“我就倒回去了，竭尽全力把精华部分读得有声有色。有一次，我使坏，在引人入胜的地方故意停下，还温顺地说：‘恐怕让你厌烦了，夫人。可以停下吗？’

“她捡起听得出神时掉下的编织活，透过眼镜瞪了我一下，以常有的简短语气说：

“‘要读完那一章呐，小姐，不要莽撞。'”

“她承认喜欢它了吗？”美格问。

“哎哟哟，不肯的啊！可是她让老贝尔沙歇菜了。我下午跑回去取手套，发现她坐在那里拼命读那本《牧师》，根本没有听到我的笑声。当时我发现好日子就要来了，就在过道里跳起了轻快的快步舞。只要她回心转意，可以享受多么愉快的生活啊！尽管她钱多，我根本不怎么嫉妒她的。我认为，财主的忧愁跟穷人比，毕竟是只多不少的。”乔补充说。

“这下我记起来了，”美格说，“我也有故事要说的。不像乔的故事那么有趣，但我回家的时候好好回味了一下的。今天，我发现金家上下统统慌里慌张的。一个孩子说，大哥做出了可怕的事情，爸爸把他撵出去了。只听金太太在哭泣，金先生的嗓门很大，格雷斯和艾伦碰到我都别过脸去，免得让我看见哭得红肿的眼睛。我当然没有去打听原委，但替他们家难过，庆幸自己没有胡来的哥哥，做了坏事给家里人丢脸。”

“我认为，比起任何恶少做的事情，上学时丢脸要难熬得多。”艾美摇摇头说，仿佛自己的人生经历属于饱经沧桑的那种。“苏希·潘金斯今天上学，戴了精美的红玉髓戒指。我也想戴，想得要命，恨不得我就是她本人。哦，她画了老师戴维斯先生的画像，鼻子巨大，还有驼背，从嘴巴放出一个气球形的说话框，说：‘小姐们，我的眼睛注视着你们！’我们大家对着画哄堂大笑，突然间他的眼睛真的注视我们了。他命令苏希把石板拿上来。她吓弹（瘫）了，可还是去了，哎哟，你看他怎么办？他拎住了她的耳朵——耳朵！想象有多可怕！——把她提到了讲台，罚她站了半小时，举着石板供大家观赏。”

“姑娘们有没有对着画儿笑呢？”乔问道。她玩味着这个麻烦局面。

“笑？没人敢！她们都坐得笔直哇。苏希痛哭流涕，没错。此刻我不嫉妒她了，我觉得，从此以后，哪怕有百万枚红玉髓戒指，也不能让我开心了。我永远永远也无法从这种痛苦不堪的奇耻大辱中恢复过来的。”艾美继续做手头的活计，自豪地体会着美德的作用，并且为了一口气成功说出了两个很难的成语而高兴。

“今天早上，我看到了喜欢看的东西。原来打算正餐时讲出来的，可我忘了，”贝丝一边说着，一边把乔乱七八糟的篮子整理好，“我出去帮汉娜取牡蛎，看见劳伦斯先生也在海鲜店里。不过他并没有看见我，我藏在鲜鱼桶后面呢，他忙着跟店老板喀特打交道。一个穷苦妇女提着木桶拖把进来，问老板能不能让她拖地板打工换一点点鱼儿吃，因为她的孩子们没有东西吃，而她之前一天都没有活干。喀特先生忙不过来，便没有好气地说‘没有！’她准备离开，面露饥色，垂头丧气。这时，劳伦斯先生用拐杖的弯头勾起一条大鱼，向她递过去。她又惊又喜，竟把鱼抱在怀里，对他千恩万谢。他吩咐她‘快去烧鱼’，她就匆匆离开，别提多高兴了！他是不是很好啊？哎，那女人的模样真的很滑稽，怀里抱着滑溜的大鱼，祝愿劳伦斯先生在天国的眠床‘适宜（意）'。”

她们笑完了贝丝的故事之后，便请母亲也讲一个。她想了想，严肃地说：

“今天，我在车间里坐着裁剪蓝色法兰绒上装，不觉为爸爸的境况感到揪心。想到要是他有个三长两短，我们会多么孤独，多么无助。这样做并不明智，却久久不能释怀。后来，一个老人进来订购衣服。他在我身边坐下，显然像个穷人，见他疲惫、焦虑的样子，我就开口跟他交谈。

“‘有儿子在军队里吗？’我问。他带来的字条不是给我的。

“‘有的，太太。共有四个，两个牺牲了，一个成了俘虏。我打算去看另一个，他病得厉害，在华盛顿住院。’他平静地回答。

“‘为国家贡献很大呀，先生。’我说，肃然起敬，取代了怜悯。

“‘都是应该做的，太太。我要是中用，还要亲自参军呢。既然不中用，就送子参军，无偿奉献。’

“他说话时语气欢乐，态度诚恳，似乎乐于奉献一切，我暗自感到羞愧。我只贡献了一个男人，还认为太多了，而他贡献了四个也在所不辞。我在家里有这么多女儿安慰自己，而他最后一个儿子在千里之外等候他，也许是为了跟他‘诀别’！想到自己的福气，我感到很富有，很开心，于是我给他打了一个精致的包袱，送给他一点点钞票，衷心感谢他给我上了一课。”

“妈妈，再来一个——就这样，带教益的。只要是真人真事，而不是过分说教，我喜欢听后加以回味。”沉默了一下之后，乔说。

马奇太太笑笑，立刻开始了。她为这些听众讲故事已经多年，懂得如何取悦她们。

“从前有四个小姑娘，不愁吃喝不愁穿，生活舒适，童年快乐，父母朋友善良，对她们宠爱有加，而她们并不满足。（这时，听众们暗自相互传递狡黠的眼色，并开始飞针走线。）这些姑娘急欲学好，做出了很好的决定，却不能持之以恒，不停地说，‘要是我们有这个就好了’, ‘要是我们能那样做就好了’，忘记了自己已经拥有了多少，自己已经能做多少事情。于是，她们问一个老太太，可以使用什么符咒，使自己格外快活。对方说：‘你们感到不满意时，就想想自己的福分，要感恩戴德。'（这时，乔猛地抬起头，仿佛要说些什么，但改变了主意，因为故事还没有完。）

“她们是通情达理的姑娘，就决定尝试老太太的建议，很快就惊奇地发现，自己是多么富有。一个姑娘发现，金钱无法把耻辱和悲伤赶出富人家庭；另一个发现，尽管自己贫穷，却拥有青春、健康、好兴致，比某位暴躁、虚弱、不会享受舒适的阔老太幸福多了；第三个发现，尽管帮厨做饭的差事令人讨厌，但上门讨饭更难熬；第四个发现，哪怕有红玉髓戒指也不如表现好值钱。于是，她们商定，不再怨天尤人，要尽情享受已经拥有的福分，努力做到受之无愧，免得福分增加不了，反而被完全收走。我相信，她们听了老太太的话，始终没有感到失望，也没有后悔。”

“啊，妈咪，你真狡猾，用我们自己的故事编派我们。这不是讲故事，而是布道！”美格大声说。

“我喜欢这种布道。爸爸以前也是说这种故事的。”贝丝若有所思地说，同时把缝衣针放到乔的针垫上。

“我不像别人那样抱怨这么多，现在要更加小心谨慎才是。我从苏希的下场得到了警示。”艾美能明辨是非。

“我们需要那种教训，不会忘怀的。如果忘记了，你只要像《汤姆大叔》中的老克罗一样对我们说‘想想上帝的恩宠吧，孩子们！想想上帝的恩宠吧！’就可以了。”乔打死也忍不住要从这个布道中发掘些许乐子出来，不过，她跟姐妹们一样，将布道的深意全都牢记在心中。

第五章　睦邻友好


“乔，你到底去干什么？”美格问。一天下午，大雪纷飞，美格看到妹妹脚踏胶靴，身披风袍，头戴风帽，一手拿着扫帚，一手提着铁铲，正踏着坚实的脚步走出过道。

“出去锻炼。”乔顽皮地眨眨眼睛说。

“早上散了两次步，走了那么远，该够了吧！外面又冷又阴沉，劝你还是和我一样，待在火炉边，这里又暖和又干燥。”美格说着不禁打了个冷战。

“我不听劝！不能整天待着不动。我又不是懒猫，可不想在火炉边打瞌睡。我喜欢冒险，想出去找点刺激。”

美格伸腿，继续烤火，读《艾凡赫》[1]。乔开始奋力铲雪。雪下得不厚，乔很快就绕着花园扫出了一条路。这样，太阳出来时，贝丝就可以在花园里散步了，她的病宝宝们需要呼吸新鲜空气呢。马奇家与劳伦斯先生的屋子中间只隔了一个花园。这是城郊，还是有点像农村，到处是树丛、草地、大花园和宁静的街道。一排矮矮的篱笆把两家隔开。篱笆的一边是褐色的老房子，光秃秃的，显得有点破败，夏天缠绕在墙上的藤蔓和屋子周围的花朵都早已凋零。另一边是一座富丽堂皇的石砌楼宇，里面有大马车房和玻璃暖房，庭院修整得干干净净，透过华丽窗帘的缝隙，隐约可以看到里面考究的摆设。这一切都彰显了屋内的舒适和豪华。但是，屋子显得有点孤单，缺乏生气，草地上看不到孩子嬉闹，窗口也见不到母亲的笑脸，除了一位老绅士和他的孙子，很少有人出入。

乔富有想象力。在她眼里，这幢漂亮的房子就像一座魔法宫殿，金碧辉煌，充满赏心乐事，却没人享受。她老早就想去看看那些隐藏于其中的豪华摆设，认识一下劳伦斯家少年。他似乎也想结识人，只是不知如何开头。自从参加舞会以后，她的这种愿望变得更加强烈，并已经设计出许多与他交朋友的方法。可最近没有看到他，乔开始认为他已经走了。一天，她看到楼上窗口有一张晒得黑黑的脸，若有所求地俯视着她们的花园，贝丝和艾美正在那里打雪仗。

“那个男孩正受罪呢，没有朋友，没有欢乐。”她心里想，“他爷爷不知道该给他什么，把他独自关在屋子里。他需要一帮快乐的小伙子来陪他玩，需要活泼开朗的年轻人来做伴。我真想过去看看，把这些话告诉那位老先生！”

想到这里，乔乐了。她胆子大，喜欢做一些鲁莽的事，还常常行为古怪，每每使美格颇为震撼。乔没有忘记过去看看的打算，这天午后，大雪纷飞，她决定见机行事。看到劳伦斯先生乘车出去了，她赶紧开始扫雪，一直扫到篱笆边，然后停下来观察了一番。一切都很安静——楼下的窗户都挂着窗帘，看不到一个仆人，连个人影都瞧不见，只有楼上窗口露出一个黑色鬈发的脑袋，在一只瘦小的手上托着。

“他在那儿。”乔心想，“可怜的小伙子！在这样阴沉的日子里，孤苦伶仃，太不像话了。扔个雪球上去，让他往外看，就可以安慰上几句了。”

乔抓了一把松软的雪，扔了上去。楼上的人马上转过头来，脸上无精打采的神情一扫而光，一双大眼睛闪闪发亮，嘴角露出一丝笑容。乔笑着点点头，挥舞着扫把叫：

“你好，病了吗？”

劳里打开窗，用渡鸦般嘶哑的声音说：

“好多了，谢谢。得了重感冒，已经困在家里一个礼拜了。”

“真不幸。拿什么来消遣呢？”

“什么都没有，这里无聊得像座坟墓。”

“不看书吗？”

“看得不多，他们不让我看。”

“没人读给你听吗？”

“爷爷有时候读给我听，可我的书他不感兴趣，我也不想老是麻烦布鲁克。”

“那么叫人来看你吧。”

“谁都不想见。男孩们太吵，我头疼受不了。”

“难道没有好女孩为你读书消遣吗？女孩们文静，喜欢护理人。”

“没有认识的。”

“可你认识我们啊。”乔开始说，然后大笑起来，很快又停了下来。

“没错！你能来吗？”劳里大声问。

“我不文静啊。要是妈妈答应，我就会来的。我这就去问她。听话，把窗户关上，等我来。”

说着，乔扛起扫把，向家里走去，一路揣摩着家里人都会怎么说。一想到有人做伴，劳里感到一阵惊喜，四处飞奔去做准备。正如马奇太太所说，他是个“小绅士”。为了对来客表示敬意，他梳理了卷曲的头发，换上了干净的衬衣领子，还整理了一下房间；仆人倒有五六个，房间里还是乱得一塌糊涂。不久，听到一声响亮的门铃声，然后是沉着的声音，要找劳里先生，满脸惊奇的仆人跑上来说，一位年轻的小姐来访。

“好的，把她领进来，那是乔小姐。”劳里说着来到小会客室的门口迎接。乔走进来，脸色红润，亲切友好，神情大方；她一手拿着盖着盖子的碟子，一手抱着贝丝的三只小猫。

“我来了，把全部家当都带来了。”她爽朗地说，“妈妈向你问好，要是我能为你做些什么，她会感到高兴的。美格要我带些她亲手做的牛奶冻，她做得很好吃的。贝丝说，她的猫咪可以安慰你。我知道你可能会觉得好笑，可我不能拒绝，要知道，她渴望助人。”

不料，贝丝借出的滑稽猫咪还真管用。劳里对着这些猫咪直笑，顾不得害羞，立刻变得善于交际起来。

乔揭开碟子的盖子，露出牛奶冻，周围是一圈绿叶和艾美最得意的天竺葵红花。“看上去真精美，都叫人舍不得吃。”他说着开心地笑了。

“这算不得什么，只是她们的一点心意，想要表示一下。叫女佣放好，你喝茶的时候吃。就这点小东西，你就吃吧。又软又滑，你喉咙痛，吃下去也不碍事。这房间真舒服！”

“如果收拾干净的话，是很舒服。可是，女佣们都懒，我也拿她们没办法。这让我伤透了脑筋。”

“过两分钟，我就能把房间收拾整齐。只需把壁炉掸一下，这样吧——把壁炉架上的东西放齐，就这样——把书放到这里，把瓶子放到那里，沙发不要对着光，枕头弄松一点。好了，这样你这里就好了。”

他这里真的一切都好了。也就是说笑的那点工夫，乔飞快地把东西整理得井井有条，房间里焕然一新。劳里静静地注视着她，内心充满了敬意。乔示意他在沙发上坐下来，他满意地叹了口气，感激地说：

“你真是太好了！啊，这房间是需要这么收拾一下。现在请坐到大椅子上，让我做点什么，逗客人开心。”

“不用，我来就是逗你开心的。要我为你读会儿书吗？”乔热切地注视着不远处几本诱人的书。

“谢谢，那些书我都看过了，不介意的话，我宁愿聊天。”劳里回答。

“完全同意。如果你让我讲，我可以讲上一天。贝丝说我从来都不知道刹车。”

“贝丝是不是脸色红润，老是待在家里的那位？她是不是偶尔才拎着个小篮子出来？”劳里饶有兴趣地问。

“是的，那就是贝丝。她很乖，我最疼她了。”

“漂亮的那位是美格，鬈头发的是艾美，是吧？”

“你是怎么知道的？”

劳里脸色霎然绯红，但坦然地说：“怎么了，要知道，我常常听到你们你喊我，我喊你。一个人待在楼上，忍不住要朝你们的房子看。你们姐妹似乎一直都过得很愉快。请原谅我这么无礼，可有时你们忘了把窗帘放下来，就是放着鲜花的那个窗户。灯亮的时候，看到炉火前，你们和妈妈围坐在桌边，就像是看一幅图画。她的脸正好对着我，透过鲜花看上去很亲切，我忍不住要看。你看，我没有妈妈的。”劳里的嘴唇不禁抽搐了一下，但他捅捅炉火，试图掩饰这一切。

劳里孤独、渴望的眼神，令乔热情的心深感震撼。她受到的教育十分单纯，脑子里没有半点杂念，虽然十五岁了，但她还是像个小孩，天真、率直。生病的劳里深感寂寞。想到自己真是富有，能享受家庭的幸福和温暖，乔乐于和他分享这份快乐。她满脸友好的神情，尖嗓门也变得格外文雅，说道：

“我们以后不再拉上那个窗帘，我要让你看个够。我只是希望，你别再偷看，可以过来看看我们的。妈妈人很好，她会给你很多的帮助。要是我求求贝丝的话，她还会为你唱上一曲，艾美会跳舞。我和美格会让你看我们可笑的舞台道具，让你痛快地笑一场。我们会玩得很愉快。你爷爷会让你过来吗？”

“我想，如果你妈妈能跟他说，他会同意我过去的。他其实心地很善良，只是看不出来罢了。只要我喜欢的事，他都会放手让我做的。他只是担心我会打扰陌生人。”劳里说，心情越来越好。

“又不是陌生人，我们是邻居。千万别担心。我们想认识你，我可老早就想这么做了。我们搬到这里的时间还不长，可所有的邻居都认识，除了你们。”

“要知道，爷爷就知道读书，外面发生什么都不管。还有，布鲁克先生，就是我的家庭教师，他不住在这里，没人陪我四处走走。我只能待在家里一个人过。”

“太糟糕了。努力一下，要是有人来请，你应该去拜访的。这样，你就会认识很多朋友，也可以到很多有趣的地方去。别担心害羞，多出去走走，就不会再这样了。”

劳里的脸又红了，乔说他害羞，他可没有生气。乔是出于好意，心直口快中的真情他怎能不领会？

他看着炉火发呆，而乔兴致勃勃地顾盼左右。“你喜欢你的学校吗？”沉默了片刻之后，男孩把话锋一转，问道。

“我可不上学，我是个实干家。我是说，我是个干实事的女孩。我服侍姑婆，她还是个既可爱又专横的老太太。”乔回答。

劳里刚要开口再问，但猛然想起，过多地打听别人的私事不礼貌，于是就及时地住了口，显得有几分尴尬。乔喜欢他有教养，并不介意在他面前开开马奇姑婆的玩笑，于是她有声有色地描绘这位烦躁不安的老太太，她的胖狮子狗，那只能说西班牙语的鹦鹉，还有自己最热衷的藏书室，劳里简直都听得入了迷。她讲到，一次有位老绅士穿戴整齐，来向姑婆求婚，正当甜言蜜语时，鹦哥扯下了他的假发，令他大为丧气。听到这里，劳里身子向后一仰，笑得眼泪都流出来了，连一位女佣都探头进来看个究竟。

“哦！真让我受益匪浅。请接着讲。”劳里说。他在沙发垫子上抬起头来，高兴得脸上红光闪闪。

乔成功了，感到得意扬扬。她便接着讲，讲的都是她们的戏文、打算，对爸爸的希望和担心，以及姐妹们居住的小世界里最有趣的事情。然后他们开始谈书，令乔感到高兴的是，她发现劳里与她一样爱读书，甚至读得比她还多。

“看你这么喜欢书，下来看看我们的书吧。爷爷出去了，不用害怕。”劳里说着站了起来。

“我天不怕地不怕。”乔把头一抬回答道。

“我相信你不怕！”男孩大声道，仰慕地看着她。可他心里还是暗暗地想，如果遇到爷爷心情不好，她一点都不怕才怪呢。

整座屋里的气氛与夏天一样热烈，劳里领着乔逐间观赏，遇到乔感兴趣的地方便驻足细看一番。这样走走停停，最后来到书房，乔见了兴奋得手舞足蹈，她平日特别高兴时都那样。里头一排一排摆满了书本，放着图画、雕塑，小橱柜装满了钱币和古玩，引人注目，还有《睡谷传奇》里那种式样的椅子、古怪的桌子和青铜器，最令人叫绝的是一个精致的花砖砌成的敞开式大壁炉。

“真是金玉满堂啊！”乔赞叹道，一屁股坐在了天鹅绒面椅子上，心满意足地环视周围。“西奥多·劳伦斯，你应该是世界上最幸福的男孩。”她顾盼自雄地说。

“人不能光靠书活着。”劳里摇摇头说，他坐在了对面的桌子上。

他还没来得及多说，门铃响了，乔跳了起来，惶恐地叫道：“天哪！是你爷爷来了！”

“哦，是又怎样呢？不是说，你天不怕地不怕的？”男孩调皮地回答。

“我觉得有点怕他，可不知道为什么怕。妈妈说我可以来，我觉得来了也对你没什么坏处。”乔说。她眼睛盯着门，但努力使自己镇定下来。

“你来后我已经好多了，万分感谢。只是担心，你跟我聊天会很累。谈得真开心，真不忍打断。”劳里感激地说。

“医生来看你了，少爷。”女佣说着招招手。

“失陪一会儿，介意吗？我想得去看医生。”劳里说。

“我不要紧。我在这里乐不可支呢。”乔回答。

劳里走了，客人则自娱自乐。她站在那位老绅士精美的肖像前，这时门又开了，但乔没有回头，果敢地说：“我肯定不会怕他的。嘴巴冷酷，却慈眉善目，看样子挺有主见。没有我外公那么潇洒，可我喜欢他。”

“承蒙夸奖，小姐。”一个声音在她背后生硬地说。劳伦斯老先生就站在那里，这令她大为懊丧。

可怜的乔，脸红得不能再红了。回想起自己刚才所说的话，她的心开始怦怦直跳。霎时她想到了跑，但那是懦夫的行为，姐妹们会嘲笑的。于是，她决定留下来，并尽可能摆脱窘境。她又看了他一眼，发现灰色的浓眉下一双充满活力的眼睛，比画中的双眼要慈祥得多，目光中闪着一丝诡秘，这使她心中轻松了许多。在那可怕的沉默之后，老先生生硬地说：“你不怕我，是吗？”他沙哑的声音变得更沙哑了。

“不太怕，先生。”

“你觉得我没有你外公那么潇洒。”

“是的，先生。”

“我挺有主见，是吗？”

“我这么认为。”

“即使这样，你还是喜欢我，是吗？”

“是的，还是喜欢，先生。”

听了这回答，老先生十分高兴。他微微一笑，握握她的手，用手指托起她的下巴，把她的脸往上一抬，严肃地仔细端详，然后放下手点头说：“长得不像你过世的外公，倒还继承了他的精神。他是个好人，孩子。更难得的是，他勇敢、诚实，我很自豪与他有交情。”

“谢谢你，先生。”他的话正中乔的下怀，乔听了以后心里很惬意。

“喂，你对我家孙子干了什么？”老先生尖锐地提出了下一个问题。

“我只想尽力做个好邻居，先生。”乔告诉了来访的缘由。

“你认为他需要开心一点，是吗？”

“是的，先生。他好像有点孤独，年轻人或许能帮助他。我们只是女孩子，可要是能帮得上忙，我们倒很愿意的。您送的圣诞礼物很棒，我们还没有忘记。”乔热情地说。

“啧，啧，啧！那可是孩子出的主意。穷女人现在怎么样了？”

“她很好，先生。”乔快嘴快舌，把胡梅尔家的所有情况讲了一遍，并告诉他，妈妈已经说服几个殷实的朋友来帮助他们。

“和她父亲一样助人为乐。告诉你母亲，抽空我要去看看她。用茶的铃声响了，由于男孩的缘故，我们早点用茶。下楼来吧，继续做个好邻居。”

“只要您喜欢请我，先生。”

“我要是不喜欢的话，就不会请你。”劳伦斯先生用传统的礼节，向乔伸出手臂。

“不知美格对此会怎么说？”乔边走边想，想到自己回家后要描述这里的情景，眼睛高兴得一闪一闪的。

劳里跑下楼来，看到乔竟然和令人生畏的爷爷手挽着手，满脸惊诧地站住。“嘿！怎么了，这孩子碰到什么鬼了？”老先生问。

“不知道您已经来了，先生。”他开口说。乔给他使了个眼色，一副得意扬扬的样子。

“明摆着的，看你冲下楼的样子就行了。来喝茶吧，少爷，拿出点绅士的风度。”劳伦斯先生慈爱地扯了扯男孩的头发，继续往前走。劳里跟在他们身后，好一会儿才反应过来，滑稽的样子引得乔差点哈哈大笑起来。

老先生喝了四杯茶，没有多说话，只是注视着两位年轻人。两人很快就跟老朋友似的聊开了，孙子的变化没有逃过他的眼睛。现在，男孩脸色红润，充满生气，仪态活泼，连笑声中也充满了真挚的欢乐。

“她说的没错，小家伙确实孤独。我倒要看看，这些小姑娘家能帮他做些什么。”劳伦斯先生看着听着，心里琢磨着。他喜欢乔，因为她古怪、率直的做事方式正合他的心意，也因为她似乎十分了解这个男孩，她自己简直就像是个男孩。

如果劳伦斯祖孙真的如乔原来所说的那样循规蹈矩、死气沉沉，她完全不会与他们合得来，因为这样的人往往使她害羞、尴尬。但她现在却发现他们坦率、随和，这就使自己感到无拘无束，也给人留下了美好的印象。他们起身时，她提出要走，但劳里说，还想请她再看些东西，遂带她来到暖房。灯火已经特地为她点亮。乔在走道上徘徊，借柔和的灯光，欣赏着两边墙上盛开的鲜花、四周美妙的藤蔓树木，尽情呼吸芳香宜人的潮湿空气，仿佛置身于仙境。这时，新朋友剪了满满的一捧美不胜收的鲜花，扎起来，带着令她愉快的神情说：“请把这些鲜花交给你妈妈，就说我很感谢她送来的药。”

他们来到大客厅，只见劳伦斯先生站在炉火前，可乔的注意力却被打开着的大钢琴深深吸引了。

“你弹琴吗？”她转向劳里问，脸上露出敬佩的表情。

“有时候弹。”他谦虚地回答。

“现在请弹弹吧。我想听听，回去再跟贝丝说。”

“你先请吧。”

“不会弹，太笨了，学不会，可我很喜欢音乐的。”

于是劳里弹，乔把鼻子埋入天芥菜花和香水月季丛中聆听着，十分惬意。他弹得美妙无比，没有半点造作，这增加了她对劳伦斯家少年的敬重。她希望贝丝能够听到他弹琴，可没有说出来，只是赞不绝口，直到他感到局促不安，最后还是爷爷前来解围。

“好了，好了，小姐，甜言蜜语太多，对他可不好。他弹得是不错，可我希望他在正经事上能同样做得出色。要走了吗？好吧，我很感激你，希望下次再来。替我向你母亲问好。晚安，乔医生。”

他亲切地与她握手作别，但显得好像有什么事不高兴。走到过道时，乔问劳里，她是否说错了话，他摇摇头。

“没有，都怪我，他不喜欢听我弹琴。”

“为什么？”

“以后再告诉你。约翰会送你回家，我不行，恕不远送。”

“不必了，我又不是娇小姐，何况没几步路。自己多保重，好吗？”

“我会的，希望你能再来。”

“只要你答应我，病好以后来看我们。”

“我会的。”

“晚安，劳里！”

“晚安，乔，晚安！”

乔把下午的经历告诉大家，惹得一家人想全体出动去拜访。每个人都发现，篱笆另一边的大房子里，有一种说不出的魅力。马奇太太想跟老人谈谈自己的父亲，因为老人还没有忘记他；美格渴望到暖房去走走；贝丝憧憬着那架大钢琴；艾美则很想观摩一下精美的图画和雕塑。

“妈妈，劳伦斯先生为什么不喜欢劳里弹琴呢？”生性好问的乔问道。

“我也不太清楚，想必是他儿子的缘故。劳里的爸爸娶了位搞音乐的意大利姑娘，老人的自尊心极强，心里很不高兴。虽然这姑娘贤淑可爱、多才多艺，可老先生就是不喜欢。他们婚后，他没有再见儿子一面。劳里很小的时候，父母就双双去世了，是爷爷把他领回了家。这孩子生在意大利，身体不太健壮，我猜想是老先生唯恐失去他，因此才谨小慎微的。劳里和他妈妈一样，天生就爱音乐，我敢说，爷爷是怕他也想当音乐家吧。无论如何，他的琴艺使老人想起不投缘的媳妇，所以他‘瞪眼睛’，正如乔说的那样。”

“哎哟，真浪漫！”美格嚷道。

“真傻帽！”乔说，“他喜欢当音乐家就让他当呗，他讨厌上大学，就不要把他送进去受罪好了。”

“我想，所以嘛，他才有一双漂亮的黑眼睛和优雅的举止。意大利人总是风度翩翩。”美格说。她有点多情。

“他的眼睛和举止你知道什么呀？你没跟他说过话，几乎没有。”乔嚷道。她可并不多情。

“我在晚会里见过他的，你讲的东西说明了他懂得举止得体。他说的妈妈送药那几句话多有意思。”

“想必他是指牛奶冻吧。”

“真是个笨孩子！他是指你，绝对没错。”

“是吗？”乔睁大眼睛，仿佛以前从没有这样想过。

“从来没有见过这样的女孩！人家恭维你还不知道。”美格说，摆出对这种事情熟门熟路的小姐的样子。

“我认为这种事是胡说八道。别这么傻，扫我的兴，我倒要谢谢了。劳里是个好男孩，我喜欢他，我不要听什么恭维呀之类的废话，太多情。我们都要待他好，他没了亲娘。他可以过来看我们的，您说对吗，妈咪？”

“对，乔，非常欢迎你的小朋友。我也希望美格记住，少女不应该过早搞得这么复杂。”

“我认为自己不算少女，我还不到十三岁呢，”艾美说，“你说呢，贝丝？”

“我正在考虑我们的《天路历程》。”贝丝答道。她一句话也没有听进去。“考虑我们如何下定决心学好，以便走出‘深渊’，穿过‘边门’，努力爬上陡坡；也许那边那座装满漂亮东西的屋子，便是我们的‘丽宫’呢。”

“我们得先偷过狮子群身边啦。”乔仿佛憧憬着。

第六章　贝丝发现“丽宫”


大房子确实是座“丽宫”，不过大家也是颇费周折才进到里面。贝丝觉得很难躲过“几只拦路狮子”：劳伦斯老先生是最大的狮子，不过，他来登门拜访了，与每个姑娘都说笑一番，和她们的母亲叙了旧。从此之后，除了腼腆的贝丝没人再怕他了。另一只狮子是：她们贫穷，劳里富有。既然不能礼尚往来，她们也就不肯接受恩惠。但是，一段时间之后，她们发现劳里竟把她们当成了恩人，对马奇太太慈母般的款待、姑娘们的热情相伴，以及在她们那所简陋的房子里所感受到的温暖，他觉得怎么做都不足以表达感激之情。于是，她们忘记了穷人的志气，投桃报李，不再计较谁付出更多。

新的友谊如春草般茁壮成长，各种愉快的事都在那时发生了。大家都喜欢劳里，而他在暗地里向家庭教师夸“马奇家的姑娘都十分出色”。出于年轻人的热情，她们把寂寞男孩接纳到她们中间，如众星捧月。她们心地单纯，劳里对这种纯洁无邪的友谊感到十分陶醉。由于他从小就失去了母亲，又没有姐妹，因此很快便感受到她们给他带来的影响。她们忙碌、活跃的生活方式，使他对自己的懒散生活感到羞愧。他厌倦读书，却发现与人交往极有乐趣。布鲁克先生不得不提交不如意的成绩报告单，因为劳里常常逃学跑到马奇家去。

“不要紧，让他放个假，以后再补回来。”老人说，“邻居那位好太太说，他学习太用功，需要年轻人做伴，需要娱乐和锻炼。我想她说得有道理，我一直对这小子娇生惯养，都像他奶奶了。只要他快乐，由着他干什么吧。他在那边的小修道院里不会捣蛋的，马奇太太比我们更能培养他。”

真的，他们度过了多么美妙的时光啊！他们一起演戏、亮相做活人造型；一起坐雪橇、溜冰；一起在马奇家的旧客厅里度过愉快的夜晚，有时则在劳里家的大房子里开小型晚会。美格随时可以去暖房漫步，尽情地采摘花束。乔在新的书房里贪婪地饱览群书，并常常发表高见，使老人捧腹大笑。艾美临摹图画，尽情地欣赏美。劳里则非常可爱地充当“庄园主”。

而贝丝呢，虽然对大钢琴朝思暮想，却鼓不起勇气走进那座被美格称为“极乐大厦”的房子。她跟乔去过一次，可老人不知道她的弱点，浓眉大眼瞪着她，还大叫一声“嘿”，吓得她双脚在地板上直打战，但绝口不跟妈妈提起。她落荒而逃，并宣布以后永远都不再踏进那里半步，也顾不得那心爱的钢琴了。任凭大家百般哄骗劝说，都无济于事。后来，此事不知怎么传到了劳伦斯先生的耳中，于是他自己着手弥补。在一次简短的拜访中，他巧妙地把话题引向音乐，大谈他见到过的大歌唱家，听到过的管风琴雅乐，还讲了许多趣闻逸事。贝丝听得着了迷，在她偏僻的角落里待不住了，悄悄地靠上前来，在老先生椅子后面停了下来。她站在那里聆听，眼睛瞪得大大的，面颊为自己不寻常的举动而涨得红红的。劳伦斯先生只当没看见她这个小飞虫，继续大讲劳里的学业和老师。不久，他好像突然想到一个主意，对马奇太太说：

“现在这孩子不理会音乐了，我很高兴，过去他太迷恋音乐了。可钢琴闲着不行啊，你家的姑娘中有哪个愿意来，经常去弹弹，这样才不会走调。你说呢，太太？”

贝丝上前一步，紧握双手，就怕一兴奋拍起手来。这个诱惑确实是无法抗拒的，一想到在那架华美的钢琴上练曲子，她就激动不已。马奇太太还没来得及回答，劳伦斯先生古怪地微微点头，笑着说：

“她们不用跟任何人打招呼，可以随时进来。我总是关着门在屋子另一头的书房里，劳里经常出去，用人们九点以后就不会再进客厅。”

他起身要走，贝丝打定主意要开口了，因为这最后的安排完全符合她的心愿。“请把我的话转告姑娘们。如果她们不想来，那也没关系。”这时一只小手握住了他的手，贝丝抬头望着他，脸上充满感激的表情。她热切而腼腆地说：

“先生，她们想去，非常非常想去！”

“你就是那个学音乐的姑娘吗？”他问，这回他没有吓人地叫“嘿”，而是慈祥地看着她。

“我叫贝丝，我很喜欢音乐。我会来的，要是您保证没人听我弹琴——也没有打扰人的话。”她补充说，唯恐不礼貌，又担心自己冒失，因而说的时候身体有点颤抖。

“不会有人来听的，乖乖。房子里有半天是没人的，来吧，你可以尽情地弹，我会感谢你的。”

“您心肠真好，先生！”

他友好地看着贝丝，她脸红得像朵玫瑰。但这次她并没害怕，而是感激地握了握大手，对老先生赠送的珍贵礼物，她没有感激的话可说。老先生轻轻地抚着她的刘海，俯身下去，吻了她一下，用几乎没人听到过的语气说：

“我以前有一个小囡囡，眼睛长得很像你。愿上帝保佑你，乖乖！再见，太太。”说完，他匆匆地走了。

贝丝和妈妈狂喜一番，由于姐妹们不在家，她跑到楼上，把振奋人心的消息告诉那些病娃娃家人。那天晚上，贝丝欢快地歌唱着，连深夜睡觉的时候，她都在艾美的脸上弹钢琴，把艾美弄醒了，引得全家人都取笑她。第二天，看到祖孙俩都出了门，贝丝犹豫再三后，壮着胆从侧门进去，然后蹑手蹑脚地来到放着她的崇拜对象的过道。当然是十分凑巧，钢琴上竟安放着一些简单而悦耳的乐谱。贝丝不时停下朝四面窥探，最后用颤抖的手指弹起了琴键。接着，她立刻忘掉了恐惧，忘掉了自己，忘掉了一切，完全陶醉在音乐中。音乐就像是她的一位心爱朋友的话语，给她带来了无以言表的快乐。

她一直弹到汉娜来叫她回家吃饭，但她没有胃口，只是坐在一边，一个劲地对着大家会心地笑。

打那以后，几乎每天都能看到一个戴棕色帽子的小姑娘穿过树篱，一个音乐精灵在过道里悄悄出没。可她从来都不知道，劳伦斯先生常常打开书房门，聆听他喜欢的老曲子；她也没看到劳里在走廊里放哨，不让用人走近；她更没怀疑放在乐谱架上的乐谱和新曲子都是特意为她安排的。每当劳伦斯先生在家里跟她漫谈音乐，她只知道他是善意地给指点迷津。她尽情徜徉在音乐中，以为自己已经如愿以偿，可事实不尽如此。也许是因为她对这种福分心存感激，更大的赐福正接踵而来，但无论如何，她都是受之无愧的。

“妈妈，我要为劳伦斯先生做一双便鞋。他待我很好，我得谢谢他，可我想不出其他什么方法。这样行吗？”在劳伦斯先生那次重要拜访的几个礼拜后，贝丝问。

“行，乖乖。这是谢他的好办法，他会高兴的。姐妹们会帮你做，我来出钱。”马奇太太回答。她特别愉快地答应了贝丝的要求，因为贝丝很少为自己提过要求。

经过与美格和乔多次认真商议后，选定了样式，买好了材料，于是便动手做鞋。深紫色的底色衬着一簇朴素而富有生机的三色堇花，鞋子设计得美观大方，大家交口称赞。贝丝起早贪黑地做，偶尔遇到难做的地方才找人帮忙。她俨然是一个麻利的针线工，还没等大家感到厌烦，鞋子就完工了。然后，她写了一张简短的便条，一天早上趁老人还没起床，让劳里帮忙悄悄地把东西放到书房桌子上。

一阵忙碌过后，贝丝等待着即将发生的事情。一天过去了，到了第二天中午，仍没有消息，她开始担心冒犯了这位脾气古怪的朋友。下午，她要出去办点事，顺便带上乔安娜，就是那个病娃娃，去做例行锻炼。回来走到大街时，她看到三个，哦，是四个脑袋在客厅的窗口探头探脑。一见她，她们就一起朝她挥手，快乐地高声尖叫：

“老先生来信了！快过来看！”

“哦，贝丝，他送你——”艾美抢先说，并拼命地用手比划着，可没等她再说下去，乔就猛地关上窗，堵住了艾美的口。

贝丝提心吊胆地往家里赶。刚到门口，姐妹们就围住了她，簇拥着来到客厅，指指点点，齐声说：“快看那儿！快看！”贝丝抬眼望去，惊喜得脸色都白了。那儿立着一架小钢琴，锃亮的琴盖上放着一封信，就像是告示牌，上面写着：“致伊丽莎白·马奇小姐。”

“给我的？”贝丝惊得吸了口气说。她抱住乔，感觉好像要昏倒，毕竟这件事真让她不知所措。

“是的，是给你的，宝贝！他是不是很棒？你觉得他是不是天底下最可爱的老先生？钥匙是放在信封里的。信还没拆看，可我们都很想知道他说了些什么。”乔叫了起来，一边抱住妹妹，一边把信递给她。

“你读吧！我不行！感觉头很晕！哦，真是太好了！”贝丝把脸埋在乔的围裙中，被礼物弄得神魂颠倒。

乔打开信，看到开头几个字就大笑起来：





马奇小姐：

亲爱的女士：





“称呼真好听！真希望有人也会这样给我写信！”艾美觉得这种传统的称呼很优雅。乔继续往下念。





我一生中穿过很多双鞋，不过，你做的这双最合脚。

三色堇是我最喜欢的花，会不时让我想起你这位温柔的赠送者。无以回礼，我想你会同意“老先生”把这份礼物送上，它是已故小孙女的。谨致以诚挚的谢意和深深的祝福。你永远的——

心存感激的朋友和谦卑的仆人，

詹姆斯·劳伦斯





“你看，贝丝，我敢说，这是值得骄傲的光荣。劳里跟我说过，劳伦斯先生最疼爱死去的小孙女，她用过的东西都小心珍藏。你想，他把她的钢琴都送给你了。那是因为你有一双大大的蓝眼睛，又喜欢音乐。”乔说。贝丝从来都没有这么激动过，她兴奋得浑身发抖，乔在安慰她。

“看这些巧夺天工的烛台，还有细腻的绿绸折成花纹，中间点缀着一朵金玫瑰，再看看这漂亮的乐谱架和琴凳，一样不缺。”美格接着说。她打开钢琴，向大家展示精妙无比的造型。

“‘谦卑的仆人，詹姆斯·劳伦斯’，听，他居然这样写。一定要告诉同学们的，她们肯定觉得妙极了。”艾美被信深深打动了。

“弹弹看，乖乖。让大家听听这宝贝琴的声音。”汉娜说，她一向与全家人同甘共苦。

于是贝丝试弹了一下，大家都说这是她们听到过的最动人的琴声。显然，钢琴刚调过音，外表收拾得整整齐齐。贝丝脚踩发亮的踏板，手指满怀深情地在漂亮的黑白琴键上跳动，脸上洋溢着最开心的笑靥。钢琴虽然很美，但我想，其真正的魅力在于此——俯在琴上的那张笑脸。

“你得上门去感谢他。”乔开玩笑说，她以为妹妹根本不敢去。

“好的，我是要去谢谢他。我现在就去，要不然，又会害怕得不敢去的。”贝丝从容不迫地走过花园，穿过树篱，走进劳伦斯家，这令全家人都感到万分惊讶。

“哎！我发毒誓保证，这是我见过的最怪的事。钢琴竟然使她头脑发热！要是脑子没问题的话，她肯定不会去的。”汉娜望着贝丝的身影惊叫道，姑娘们也被这一幕惊得哑口无言。

如果她们看到贝丝此后的所作所为，肯定会更加大惊失色。信我的话，她想都没想就敲了书房的门，听到一个粗哑的声音说：“进来！”她真的进去了，径直走到惊讶的劳伦斯先生跟前，伸出手，声音只是稍微有点颤抖地说：“我是来感谢您的，先生，谢谢您——”她没有说完，他的慈祥面容使她一下子忘了要说的话，脑子里只想着他失去了钟爱的小囡囡，便双手搂住老人的脖子，吻了他一下。

即使屋顶突然掀掉，老先生也不会更惊讶。不过，他喜欢这样——哦，老天，是的，他喜欢得不得了！——那信赖的轻轻一吻，使他那么感动、那么高兴，生硬的脾气就此一扫而光。他让贝丝坐在膝头，布满皱纹的脸靠着她的红红脸颊，仿佛觉得找回了自己的小孙女。从那一刻起，贝丝不再怕他，坐在那里跟他温馨地聊着天，仿佛一生下来就与他相识；正是：爱必消除恐惧，感激能征服傲慢。她回家时，老人一直送到她家门口，与她诚挚地握手，往回走时又碰了一下帽檐向她致意，身子挺直，神情庄重，就像一位英俊勇武的老绅士，事实上，他也确是如此。

姑娘们看到这一幕时，乔掩饰不住内心的喜悦，跳起了快步舞；艾美惊讶得差点掉到窗外；美格举着双手惊叫：“完了，我看世界末日要到了！”





第七章　艾美的耻辱谷


“那小子真像希腊神话的独眼巨人，你说呢？”一天，艾美说。这时劳里正策马嘚嘚而行，经过时还把马鞭一扬。

“你怎么敢这样说话？他一双眼睛完整无缺，而且漂亮得很哩。”乔叫起来。她容不得人家说她的朋友半点坏话。

“我又没有说他的眼睛，不明白你怎么会发火，人家只是羡慕他的骑术而已。”

“噢，老天爷！这戆头鹅原来是指半人马神啊，却把他叫成了独眼巨人。”乔发出一阵大笑。

“不用如此无礼，这只是戴维斯老师所说的‘口吴（误）’而已，”艾美反驳道，用其拉丁语水平把乔镇住，“我只是希望，能拥有一丁点儿劳里花在那马上的钱。”她仿佛自言自语，但却希望姐姐们听到。

“干什么？”美格好意问道。而乔却因艾美第二次用错词而再次大笑起来。

“我负了一身债，急需用钱，但还要等一个月才能领零用钱。”

“负债，艾美？怎么回事？”美格神情严肃起来。

“哦，我至少欠下一打腌酸橙。我得有钱才能还呀。妈妈不许我在商店赊账的。”

“把事情详细说说。现在时兴酸橙啦？以前可是拿刺橡胶块来做胶球的。”美格尽量不动声色，而艾美则神情严峻，不肯放松。

“哦，是这样的。姑娘们成天都买酸橙，你也得跟着买不是？否则别人觉得你小气。现在只有酸橙时兴，上课时人人都埋在书桌下咂酸橙，下课时用酸橙交换铅笔、念珠戒指、纸娃娃什么的。如果女同学相互要好，就送上一个酸橙。如果讨厌她，便当着她的面吃一个，不叫她来咂一口。她们轮流做东，我已经吃了人家不少，一直没有还礼，我应该还请，那可是信用债啊。”

“还差多少钱才能恢复信用？”美格一面问，一面拿出钱包。

“一个二角五分硬币已经绰绰有余，还剩下几分钱请你。你不喜欢酸橙吗？”

“不怎么喜欢，我那份你吃掉了吧。这是钱，尽量省着用吧。钱不多啊。”

“谢谢！有零花钱真好！我要大吃一顿了，本礼拜就没有尝过酸橙呢。人家给我吃，怪不好意思的，无法还人情嘛。真想吃一个啊。”

第二天，艾美上学迟到，可最终还是忍不住把潮湿的棕色纸包炫耀了一番，神情虽然颇为自得，不过这倒也情有可原。然后，她才把纸包放到课桌最里面的角落。没过几分钟，艾美·马奇有二十四个美味酸橙（她在路上吃了一个）可以请客的消息，就在“圈子”中流传开来。朋友们献的殷勤让人受不了。凯蒂·布朗当场邀请她参加下一次舞会；玛丽·金斯利硬把手表借她戴到下课；珍妮·斯诺是一个尖酸刻薄的小姐，在艾美没有酸橙送的时候曾经卑鄙地挖苦过她，可她现在立刻与艾美握手言和，并主动提供一些难题的答案。但是，艾美没有忘记斯诺小姐尖刻的话：“别看某些人鼻子扁塌，可她能闻到人家的酸橙。某些人虽然傲气，可她会伸手跟人家要酸橙的。”于是，艾美辛辣回敬，索性把“冰雪女[1]”的希望打得粉碎：“不用马上这么客气起来，你别想吃到。”

那天上午，刚好有位名士来校参观，艾美地图画得漂亮，受到了表扬。斯诺小姐对冤家的这种荣誉耿耿于怀，马奇小姐却为此摆出一副扬扬得意的架子。不过，哎，可悲啊，骄兵必败，一心想报仇的斯诺扭转局面，令冤家一败涂地。来客照例讲了一番陈词滥调，他刚鞠躬退出，斯诺马上就假装问重要问题，却向老师戴维斯先生告密，艾美·马奇课桌里藏着腌酸橙。

原来，老师早就宣布酸橙为违禁品，并郑重声明要把查到的第一个违禁者当众绳之以法。这位相当顽强的先生经过了一场场旷日持久的激烈斗争，成功地禁绝了口香糖，没收烧毁了小说和报纸，取缔了一所地下邮局，并禁止做鬼脸、起绰号、画漫画等，为了把五十个反叛的姑娘训导得服服帖帖，他能做的都做了。老天作证，男孩们已经够让人受的了，可谁知姑娘们更难对付。在那些神经紧张、脾气暴躁又缺乏教学天赋的人看来，情况更是如此。戴维斯先生精通希腊语、拉丁文、代数，各门学问都很好，所以被命名为好老师，毕竟没人特别看重举止、德行、情操、表率。斯诺心里明白，这个时候告发艾美，她只有倒霉的份儿了。那天早上，戴维斯先生显然把咖啡调得太浓，又由于刮东风而神经痛，而他的学生又没有理所当然地给他争光。因此，用一个女生不太优雅但很形象的话说：“他紧张得像个巫婆，脾气大得像头熊。”“酸橙”简直就是引爆火药的火苗，他黄脸气得通红，用力一拍桌子，吓得斯诺一溜烟逃回座位。

“小姐们，请注意！”

听到一声断喝，唧喳声戛然而止。五十双蓝色的、黑色的、灰色的、褐色的眼睛乖乖地盯着老师那张可怕的脸。

“马奇小姐，到讲台前来。”

艾美应着站起来，虽然表面镇静，内心却暗暗地害怕，酸橙压得她心头喘不过气来。

“把你桌子里的酸橙带过来。”她还没来得及离座，又听到一声意外的命令。

“不要都拿光。”同桌同学倒还算冷静，低声对艾美说。

艾美匆匆抖出六个，然后将其余的拿到老师面前，心想任何有人情味的人闻到那股香喷喷的气味，都会为之心动。不幸的是，戴维斯先生特别厌恶这种时尚蜜饯的气味，便更加怒火中烧。

“都在了？”

“还有几个。”艾美结结巴巴地说。

“马上把剩下的交出来。”

艾美绝望地朝朋友们望了一眼，只得遵命。

“肯定没有了？”

“我从不撒谎，老师。”

“那好，现在把这些恶心的东西两个两个地扔到窗外。”

异口同声的叹息声，如一阵黑风。眼看最后一线希望破灭，渴望已久的美味，现在到了嘴边，却被夺走了。艾美又羞又恼，脸涨得通红，可怕哟，来回走了足足六趟。每当一对倒霉的酸橙——噢！瞧，它们是那么饱满多汁——从她手中极不情愿地被扔下去，街上就响起一声欢呼。这表明姑娘们的零食落到了她们的死敌，就是那些爱尔兰小鬼的嘴里，他们还为此欢呼雀跃，可这却使姑娘们痛苦不已。这——这确实太过分了，一个个都把目光投向冷酷无情的戴维斯，有的愤怒，有的恳求，一位酷爱酸橙的女孩眼泪都流了出来。

艾美扔完最后两个酸橙回来，老师令人毛骨悚然地“哼”了一声，然后故作威严地训斥道：“小姐们，你们应该记得我一周前说的话。发生这种事情，我深感遗憾。绝不纵容违纪者，我从不食言的。马奇小姐，把手伸出来。”

艾美吓了一跳，双手藏到背后，哑口无言，只是哀求地望着他，其实这种表情比任何语言都能打动人。她可是“老戴维斯”（当然，大家都是这么叫他的）的一位颇为得意的门生。不知哪位姑娘按捺不住“嘘”的一声以示义愤，否则，我个人相信，他会食言的。那嘘声尽管很轻，却激怒了这位生性暴躁的绅士，也决定了这位犯规者的命运。

“手伸出来，马奇小姐！”这是对她无声哀求的唯一回答。艾美生性高傲，既不哭也不开口哀求，她咬紧牙关，把头往后一甩以示自己的抗议，毫不畏缩地任由小手掌挨了几下打。尽管只是轻轻地拍了几下，但这对艾美来说与痛打没什么区别。这是她有生以来第一次挨打，在她看来，这与把她打倒在地没什么不同，是奇耻大辱。

“现在，你就站在讲台前，一直到下课。”戴维斯先生说，他决定一不做，二不休。

太可怕了。回座看着小朋友们怜悯的目光和少数敌人幸灾乐祸的神色，这已经够受的了，而要蒙着新羞面对全班师生，简直是可忍，孰不可忍。一刹那，她觉得自己就要当场栽倒在地，然后放声痛哭一场。但那种痛苦的委屈感，和对珍妮·斯诺的顾忌使她挺住了。踏上那个可耻的地方，下面就像是一片人海。她两眼直勾勾地盯着上方的壁炉烟囱管，一动不动地站在那里，脸色煞白。看到这样一位悲情人物站在面前，姑娘们都无心上课了。

在接下来的一刻钟里，好强而敏感的小姑娘忍受着耻辱和痛苦的煎熬，对此她将永远刻骨铭心。在别人看来，这可能只是小事一桩，或许可以一笑了之，但对她来说，这是一次痛苦的经历。在她十二年的生活中，她完全被爱所笼罩，以前从未遇到过这样的打击。此时，她忘记了小手的刺痛和心灵的创伤，心头只萦绕着一个念头：“回家要讲这件事啦，她们听了会对我多么失望！”

一刻钟简直就是一个小时，终于等到了下课。“下课”这个词对她来说，从来都没有这么亲切过。

“可以走了，马奇小姐。”老师说。看得出来，他心里也不好受。

临走时，艾美充满怨恨地瞪了他一眼，令他印象深刻。她一句话都没说，径直走到休息室，抓起自己的东西就走。她激昂地对自己说，要“永远”离开这个鬼地方。她到家时神色黯然。不久，姐姐们都回家了，马上召开一次声讨大会。马奇太太显得神色不安，但没多说话，只是用无限的温情安慰这个受伤的女儿。美格边掉眼泪，边用甘油涂那受伤的手；贝丝感到，对于这样的心灵创伤，她可爱的小猫咪也无济于事；乔愤怒地提出，立刻逮捕戴维斯先生；汉娜对那“坏蛋”挥舞着拳头，用力地捣着土豆做饭，仿佛坏蛋就在她的捣杵下面。

除了几个伙伴，没人注意到艾美逃学。不过，眼尖的姑娘发现，戴维斯先生下午上课态度和蔼，而且显得分外紧张。就在放学前不久，乔来了。只见她板着脸，阔步走到讲台前，扔下母亲的一封信，收拾起艾美的东西就走。临走时，在擦鞋垫上仔细地刮去靴底的泥，仿佛要把此地的尘土从脚上彻底抖落。

“好吧，可以不去上学，放个假，可我希望你每天能和贝丝一起学点东西。”那天晚上，马奇太太说，“我不赞成体罚，特别是对女孩子。我并不欣赏戴维斯先生的教学方法，不过你结交的也不是使你受益的好姑娘。我打算问一下你爸的意见，然后把你转学。”

“太好了！希望所有女同学都走掉，搞垮他那个破学校。一想起那些诱人的酸橙，简直会让人发疯。”艾美叹息道，一副殉道者的架势。

“丢了酸橙，我并不难过，毕竟违反校规，应该受罚。”母亲严厉地回答。这位小姐本来一心想得到安慰，没想到母亲竟然这么说，她感到十分失望。

“你是说，我在全校师生面前丢脸，你很高兴？”艾美嚷嚷道。

“用那种方法来修正过错，我觉得并不可取。”妈妈回答说，“可我不敢说，换种温和点的方法就会对你有好处。你现在变得越来越自负，乖乖，该改一改了。你有许多天赋和优点，可没必要为此夸耀。要知道，若是自负，再出色的天才也会一事无成。真正的才能和美德不怕长期埋没，哪怕真的没人发现，只要自己知道拥有它，并能恰到好处地加以利用，就一定会感到满足。一切才华的巨大魅力，就在于谦虚。”

“千真万确！”在一旁跟乔下象棋的劳里大声道，“我曾认识一个女孩，她音乐天赋极高，却并不自知，她从不知道自己私下作的小曲有多美，即使别人告诉她，她自己也不会相信。”

“要是我能认识那位好女孩就好了，她或许可以帮助我，我这么笨。”贝丝说。她站在劳里身边认真倾听。

“你确实认识她，她比任何人都更能帮你。”劳里答道，快乐的黑眼睛调皮地望着她，贝丝霎时羞红了脸，把脸埋在沙发垫里，被这出乎意料的发现弄得不知所措。

乔让劳里赢了棋，以奖励他称赞了她的贝丝。贝丝经这么一夸，怎么也不肯出来弹琴献艺了。于是劳里一展身手，他边弹边唱，心情显得特别轻松愉快，因为他在马奇一家人面前极少流露自己的忧郁性格。他走后，整个晚上一直闷闷不乐的艾美似乎灵机一动，突然问道：“劳里是否称得上多才多艺？”

“没错，他接受过优等教育，又富有天赋；如果不被宠坏，是个人才。”她母亲回答。

“而且他不自大，对吗？”艾美问。

“一点也不。所以他才这么富有魅力，我们全都这么喜欢他。”

“我懂了，多才多艺、优雅高贵当然好，但不能向人炫耀，也不能瞧不起人。”艾美若有所思地说。

“如果使用得当，这些品质总可以从一个人的言谈举止中看得见、摸得着。根本没必要去炫耀嘛。”马奇太太说。

“就像你一下子戴上帽子，穿上衣服，再饰上丝带，就怕别人不知道你衣饰多。这确实不行的。”乔补充说，训话告一段落，随之响起一阵笑声。

第八章　乔遭遇恶魔


“姐姐们，你们去哪里？”一个周六的下午，艾美走进房间，看到美格和乔正准备出去，一副神秘兮兮的样子，于是便好奇地问。

“别管，小姑娘家别问这么多。”乔尖刻地回答。

如果有什么可以让我们年轻人伤感情的话，就是有人对我们说“小孩子家别问这么多”。如果说上一句“乖乖，走开点”，会令我们更难受的。艾美听了这样的侮辱怒不可遏，决心即使磨上一个小时，也一定要搞清这个秘密。美格从来都没有长时间拒绝过她，于是她转向美格，花言巧语地说：“告诉我吧！我想你们也会让我一起去的。贝丝整天弹琴，弄得我没事可做，真孤单。”

“不能啊，乖乖，人家可没邀请你。”美格开口了。可乔不耐烦地插话说：“好了，美格，别说了，要不会把整件事搞糟的。艾美，你不能去，别耍小孩子脾气，嘟嘟囔囔的。”

“你们要跟劳里一起去，肯定是。昨天晚上，你们在沙发上说悄悄话，还笑呢。等到我一进来，你们就不说了。是不是要跟他一起出去？”

“是的，没错，现在可以静下来了吧，别烦我们。”

艾美没有再说，只是眼巴巴看着。她看到美格把一把扇子塞进口袋。

“知道了！知道了！你们要去戏院看《宝石湖上七城堡》! ”她嚷嚷道，接着坚决地说，“我要去，妈妈说过这出戏我可以看。我有零用钱的。不立刻告诉我，太小气了。”

“听我说几句，乖。”美格用安慰的口气说，“妈妈不希望你这个礼拜去，你的眼睛还没好，受不了这部童话剧的灯光刺激。下个礼拜，你可以和贝丝、汉娜一起去，再享受也不迟。”

“我想跟你们和劳里一起去，不喜欢和她们。请让我去吧。我感冒这么长时间了，老待在家里。我想找点快乐，想得要命。求求你，美格！我会很听话的。”艾美恳求道，努力装出一副可怜的样子。

“要是我们带上她，只要把她裹得严实点，我想妈妈也不会反对吧？”美格说。

“她去，我就不去。我不去的话，劳里会不高兴的。再说，这样也很没礼貌，他只邀请了我们两个，而我们要拉上艾美一起去。我还以为，不要她的地方，她是不应该去插一杠子的。”乔生气地说，她只想自己痛快一场，不想费神去照看一个坐立不安的小孩。

她的口气和态度激怒了艾美。艾美一边开始穿上靴子，一边用令人恼火的口气说：“我就要去，美格说我可以去。我自己付钱的话，就与劳里无关。”

“又不能和我们坐在一起，我们已经订了座位，你又不能一个人坐，劳里会把他的座位让给你，那我们就会扫兴。他也可能给你再找一个座位，可那不合适，没邀请你嘛。你一步都别动，就待在这里。”乔责骂道，她匆忙中刺痛了手指，变得更加生气。

艾美穿着一只靴子坐在地板上，放声大哭起来。美格劝她，这时劳里在楼下叫，两位姑娘匆匆下楼，任凭妹妹号啕大哭。艾美经常装出一副大人的样子，可她也时常忘记这一点，就像一个宠坏的孩子。两位姐姐刚要出门，艾美在楼梯的扶栏上用威胁的口吻喊道：“乔·马奇，你会后悔的，我们走着瞧。”

“你敢！”乔说着砰地关上了门。

《宝石湖上七城堡》十分精彩，她们看得很过瘾，度过了美妙的时光。不过，尽管红小鬼滑稽可笑，小精灵光彩夺目，王子公主美不胜收，乔的快乐却总是夹杂着些许苦涩。看到美若天仙的王后一头黄色鬈发，她便想到艾美，幕间休息的时间都花在猜测艾美会如何行动来令她后悔。她和艾美在生活中发生过多次激烈的小冲突，两人都是急性子，惹急了都会采取暴力。艾美挑逗乔，乔激怒艾美，偶尔会爆发脾气，事后两人都惭愧不已。乔虽然年长，却最不能自制。她的火暴性子屡屡使她惹祸上身，却着实难以加以约束。她的怒气总是不持久，不久就低三下四地认了错，她便诚心悔改，努力学好。姐妹们常说，她们倒挺喜欢把乔逗得勃然大怒，因为之后她便成了温柔的天使。可怜的乔竭尽全力要学好，但深藏心中的敌人总是随时发脾气，把她扳倒。经过数年的耐心努力，她才稍稍收敛了一些。

美格和乔到家，只见艾美正在客厅里看书。她们进来时，她装出一副受委屈的样子，低头看着书，连眼都不抬，也没问一个问题。要是贝丝没在那里问这问那，听两位姐姐兴奋地描述剧情，好奇心也许就会战胜愤恨，艾美也许就会上去问个明白的。乔走上楼去放她的帽子，她首先看看衣柜，因为上次吵架时，艾美把乔的顶层抽屉倒在地板上翻了个底朝天，以发泄内心的怨恨。还好，一切都没动，乔匆匆地扫视了衣橱、袋子和箱子，接着便认定艾美原谅了自己，忘记了冤屈。

这回乔想错了。第二天，她发现少了件东西，于是引发了一场狂风暴雨。傍晚时分，美格、贝丝和艾美正坐在一起，这时乔冲进房间，神情激动，气喘吁吁地问：“有谁拿了我的书？”

美格和贝丝满脸惊讶，立刻说“没有”。唯独艾美捅了捅炉火，一声不吭。乔见她脸色都变了，便冲过去。

“艾美，你拿了我的书。”

“没有，我没拿。”

“那你知道在哪里！”

“不知道。”

“撒谎！”乔嚷道。她一把抓住艾美的肩膀，神态凶狠，就是比艾美再胆大的孩子见了也会害怕。

“没撒谎。我没拿，也不知道在哪里，得了吧。再说我也不想知道。”

“你肯定心中有数，最好马上说出来，不然，看我怎么收拾你。”乔稍微推搡了她一下。

“随你怎么骂，反正，永远都别想再见到你那本傻乎乎的书。”艾美嚷道，她也变得激动起来。

“为什么？”

“我把它烧了。”

“什么！我那么喜欢那本小书，反复推敲，本来想在爸回家前写完的！你竟然把它烧了，是不是真的？”乔问。她脸色苍白，两眼迸出愤怒的目光，双手神经质地抓住艾美不放。

“是的！烧了！谁叫你昨天发火，我说过要让你付出代价的。于是，我就——”

艾美没有再往下说，因为乔已经怒不可遏。她一边使劲地推搡艾美，弄得艾美牙齿咯咯作响，一边悲愤交加地喊道：

“你这个恶毒的丫头！再也写不出来了，我一辈子都不会原谅你的。”

美格赶紧上前救下艾美，贝丝也过来安慰乔。可乔已无法控制自己，临走时打了妹妹一记耳光，随后冲出房间，跑上阁楼，坐在旧沙发上，单方面结束了争吵。

马奇太太回到家里后，楼下的风暴才平息。她听说了此事，很快就使艾美认识到自己做了对不起姐姐的事。乔的书是她心目中的骄傲，也被全家当作前途无量的文学萌芽。虽只不过是五六则小童话，可乔默默地加以千锤百炼。她全身心地投入了创作，盼望写出些优秀的作品能够发表。她刚仔仔细细地誊抄了一遍，并毁掉了旧草稿，因此艾美的一把火烧掉了她几年的心血。这对别人来说只是个微不足道的损失，可在乔看来，却是一场可怕的灾难，她觉得这是永远都不能弥补的损失。贝丝伤心得像失去了一只小猫咪，美格拒绝保护她的宝贝艾美，马奇太太神色严峻，伤心万分，艾美现在也比谁都后悔，除非她认错道歉，否则没人会爱她了。

茶点的铃声响起时，乔露面了，脸色铁青，对人不理不睬。艾美鼓足勇气怯弱地说：

“请原谅我，乔姐。我真的非常、非常抱歉。”

“永远都不会原谅你的。”乔严厉地回答。从那一刻起，她完全不理艾美了。

没人再提起这场大祸，连马奇太太也不例外。大家都知晓一条经验：乔情绪如此低落时，说什么也白搭。最好的办法就是等待一些小事的发生，或者要靠她自身宽容的天性，来化解内心的愤恨，治愈心灵的创伤。这天晚上，虽然照常做针线活，母亲照样朗读布雷默[1]、司各特[2]、埃奇沃思[3]的作品，但气氛根本不快活，大家若有所失，原来甜蜜、平静的家庭生活打乱了。到了唱歌时间，大家的体会更加深切，贝丝只是默默抚琴，乔呆立一旁，活像个石头人，艾美失声痛哭，只剩下美格和母亲孤军作战地吟唱。但是，虽然她们力图唱得像云雀一样欢快，银铃般的歌喉已失去往日的和谐，全都像是走调了。

乔接受晚安吻别时，马奇太太轻轻地说：“乖乖，别因为心中有恨，就见不到太阳，你们要互相原谅，互相扶持，明天一切都从头开始。”

乔真想扑到妈妈怀里痛哭一场，把悲伤和愤怒都发泄出来，但有道是眼泪属于弱者。而且，她内心感到深深的伤痛，真的不能原谅谁。她勉强地眨眨眼，点了点头。见到艾美在一边听，她便粗声粗气地说：“这么卑鄙可恶，不值得原谅。”

说着，她大步朝卧室走去。那天晚上，姐妹们没有说笑，也没讲悄悄话。

艾美主动求和遭拒，便恼羞成怒，但愿自己没有低声下气，觉得受到了莫大的伤害，于是便炫耀起自己的优良品质，显得特别令人恼火。乔脸上依然乌云密布，这一天，所有事情都乱套了。早晨寒风刺骨，乔把珍贵的酥饼掉到了阴沟里，马奇姑婆坐立不安。美格忧郁着，贝丝等她到家时摆出一副愁眉苦脸、忧思无限的样子，而艾美在大放厥词，指责某些人虽然嘴上老说要学好，可当有人已经做出了表率，她们却还不肯行动。

“每个人都这么怨气冲天，还是找劳里一起滑冰去。他总是那么亲切，那么快活。我知道，和他在一起，心情会好些。”乔心想，然后跨出门去。

艾美听到冰鞋的碰撞声，向外一望，急得大叫：“你看看！她答应过我，下次带上我去，这可是最后一次结冰了。可要这个人带我去，等于白说，瞧，她脾气多暴躁。”

“别这么说。你昨天太不听话了。谁叫你把她的宝贝书烧了呢，她当然不肯轻易原谅你。不过，我想她现在会原谅你的，我猜她会的，只要在适当的时候开口。”美格说，“跟着他们，不要说话，等到乔和劳里有说有笑，你再趁空挡上前，只要吻她一下，或者做件友好的事，我敢说，她又会真心诚意地跟你和解的。”

“我去试试。”艾美说。这个主意正合她意。一阵匆忙之后，她准备好了，朝他们追了上去。而两位朋友正消失在山的那边。

这里离河边不远，两人没等艾美来到就已经准备好了。乔见她过来了，就背过身去。劳里没有看见她，正小心翼翼地沿着河岸滑冰，探测冰层的声音，因为在冰天雪地的前几天有过一段暖和的日子。

“我先到第一个弯口去，看看可不可以滑，然后再开始比赛。”艾美听到劳里这么说。只见他身穿一件皮毛镶边的外套，头戴帽子，就活像一个英俊的俄国小伙子，飞也似的滑去。

乔是听见艾美奔跑来的，在她身后气喘吁吁地跟着跑，一边跺脚，一边穿冰鞋，还往手上呵气。她就是不转身，沿河岸歪歪扭扭地慢慢滑行，妹妹遇到了麻烦，她心里反而感到解气，但也只是一种夹杂着苦涩和不悦的快意。满腔怨恨，越积越深，最后使她丧失了理智，犹如罪恶的念头和情绪，不及时排除，必酿成大祸。劳里转过弯，回头大声喊道：

“要靠岸边滑，中间不安全。”

乔听到了，可艾美还在使劲站稳脚跟，一个字都没听见。乔扭头瞟了她一眼，藏在她心中的小魔鬼在耳边说：

“管她有没有听到，随她去吧。”

劳里绕过转弯处不见了，乔刚好来到转弯处，艾美还远远地落在后面，她正朝河中央平滑的冰面滑去。乔愣了一会儿，心中升起一种不祥的预感。她还是决定继续向前滑行，可莫名的感觉使她停下脚步，回头正好看到妹妹撒开双手，身体往下掉，随之听到一声融冰的破裂声，看到水花溅起，同时传来一声惨叫，吓得乔心都快要停止跳动了。她试图叫劳里，可就是叫不出声；她想往前冲，可双脚疲软无力，不听使唤。她束手无策、满脸恐惧，两眼直勾勾地盯着黑油油水面上的那顶蓝色小帽。一个身影从她身边一闪而过，劳里大声喊道：

“快！快！拿根棍子来。”

她是怎么拿的，连自己都不知道。但在接下来的几分钟里，她好像中了邪似的，茫然地听从劳里的吩咐。劳里则十分镇定，他平卧在冰面上，用手臂和冰球棒勾住艾美。等到乔从篱笆上抽出一根横杆，才一起把孩子拉了出来。艾美吓得要命，幸好没有受伤。

“快，必须尽快把她弄回家，我们的衣服给她盖上，我先要把她这双该死的冰鞋脱掉。”劳里边喊边把自己的皮衣给艾美裹上，他使劲地扯鞋带，解带从来都没有这么麻烦过。

他们把艾美送回了家。她颤抖着，浑身滴着水，还一个劲地哭喊。经历了这场惊心动魄的意外之后，艾美全身裹着毯子，在炉火前睡着了。在这阵手忙脚乱的时候，乔连话都没说，只是急得团团转，脸色苍白，神色慌张，衣服脱去不少，裙子撕了个口子，双手也被冰块、横杆和坚硬的扣子擦伤了。艾美安然入睡，屋子里安静下来，马奇太太坐在床边，把乔叫到身边，替她包扎手上的伤口。

“肯定她没事了吗？”乔轻声问，她望着长满金发的脑袋，心里满是悔恨，这颗脑袋差一点就要在险恶的冰层下消失，再也见不到了。

“没事了，乖乖。她没有受伤，我想连感冒都不会得。你们做得很对，用衣服把她裹住，又马上送回家。”母亲欣慰地说。

“这些都是劳里做的。我当时只是听天由命。妈妈，要是她出了意外，都是我的错。”乔倒在床边，眼里噙满了悔恨的泪水。她诉说着发生的一切，狠狠地责备自己竟然铁石心肠。她泣不成声地祷告，感谢老天，使她幸免了严厉的惩罚。

“都怪我脾气不好！我想努力改正。我还以为已经改好了，谁知比以前更糟了。妈妈啊，我该怎么办？怎么办？”可怜的乔绝望地喊道。

“自己当心，再加上祈祷，乖乖。不要灰心，也不要觉得缺点改不掉。”马奇太太说着，把那蓬乱的脑袋靠到自己肩头上，体贴地亲吻满是泪水的面颊，可乔哭得更凶了。

“您不知道，您猜不到我的脾气有多坏！我发火时好像什么事都干得出来。我会变得很野蛮，谁都会伤害，还幸灾乐祸。我怕有一天会做出可怕的事，毁了自己的一生，谁都会恨我。妈妈，帮帮我吧，求您帮帮我吧！”

“我会的，宝贝，我会的。别哭得这么伤心，要记住这一天，下决心保证不重犯。乖乖，我们都要面临魔鬼的诱惑，有些比你碰到的还要厉害得多，往往要用一生的时间来抵御。你觉得你的脾气是世上最坏的，其实我以前脾气跟你一样坏。”

“您的脾气？怎么，可从没见过妈妈您生气呀！”乔惊讶得暂时忘掉了悔恨。

“四十年来，我一直在努力改正，只是学会了如何控制。在我一生中，几乎每天都生气，可我学会了不发作。我还希望随遇而安，可能又得熬上四十年，才能做到吧。”

她深爱着的母亲脸上所表现出的忍耐和谦卑，对乔来说，是最贤明的教导和最严厉的责备。有了母亲给她的安慰和信心，她立刻舒畅多了。知道母亲也有她这样的缺点，也在努力改正，她更觉得容易承受些。要痛下决心，改正缺点，虽然四十年当心和祈祷的周期，对一个十五岁的少女来讲，显得那么漫长。

“妈妈，当马奇姑婆责骂，或有人烦扰您时，您有时紧闭双唇走出屋外，那是不是在生气？”乔问道，觉得自己跟妈妈越发亲近了。

“是的，我学会了压住冲到嘴边的气话，觉得这些话要不由自主冲口而出时，我就走开一会，为自己的软弱、恶意敲敲警钟。”马奇太太叹口气，笑了笑，边说边把乔散乱的头发理顺、扎好。

“您是怎样学会保持冷静的？我正为此麻烦不断——刻薄话总是不假思索地飞出口；说得越多越糟糕，最后恶语伤人、恶毒攻击成了乐趣。请告诉我您是怎样做的，好妈咪。”

“我的好妈妈过去总是帮我——”

“就像您帮我们一样——”乔插嘴说道，感激地献上一吻。

“但我在比你稍大一点的时候便失去了她。我自尊心极强，不愿对别人坦白自己的弱点，因此多年来只能独自挣扎。我失败过许多次，并为此洒下无数痛苦的泪水。乔，难哪，尽管我非常努力，但似乎总是毫无进展。后来你父亲出现了，我沉浸在幸福之中，发现学好并非难事。但后来，当我膝下有了四个小女儿，家道中落时，老毛病又犯了，因为我天生缺乏耐性，看到孩子们缺这少那，心里便煎熬得厉害。”

“可怜的妈妈！那么是什么帮助了您？”

“你父亲，乔。他从不失去耐心——从不怀疑，从不怨天尤人——而是乐观地企盼、快乐地工作和满怀信心地等待，使人耻于跟他唱对台戏啊。他帮助我，安慰我，让我知道，如果想要女儿拥有美德，自己就要身体力行，我就是楷模呀。想到为你们努力，而不是为自己，事情就容易了；每当我说话太冲，你们投来又惊又骇的目光，这比言语叱责更厉害。我努力以身作则，赢得了孩子的爱戴、尊敬和信任，这就是最美好的报偿。”

“啊，妈妈，我及得上您一半就心满意足了。”乔深受感动地说道。

“我希望你会做得更好，乖乖。但你得时时提防你爸所说的‘藏在心中的敌人’；不然，即使它没有毁掉你一生，也会使你终生痛苦。你已经得到了警示，要牢记在心头，竭尽全力控制自己的暴躁脾气，以免酿成比今天更大的悲剧，抱憾终生。”

“我一定努力，妈妈，真的。但您得帮助我，提醒我，防止我祸从口出。我以前看见，爸爸有时用手指按住双唇，用异常亲切而严肃的眼光望着您，您便紧咬嘴唇，或是走出门去。他这样是不是在提醒您？”乔轻轻问道。

“是的。我叫他这样帮助我，他也从不忘记。看到那个小小的手势和亲切的目光，我的恶言便收口了。”

乔看到母亲讲话时眼睛噙满泪水，嘴唇轻轻颤动，担心是自己说得太多了，便赶紧轻声问道：“这样望着您，跟您谈这个问题不对吗？并非有意冒犯，可是跟您谈心我就畅快，就感到又安全又幸福。”

“我的乔，你可以向母亲倾诉衷肠。女儿向我诉说心里话，并明白我是多么爱她们，这对我来说是最大的幸福，最大的骄傲。”

“我以为使您伤心了呢。”

“不，乖乖，只是提起父亲，我便想到多么想念他，多么感激他，多么应该忠实地为他照看他的四个小女儿，使她们平安、乖巧。”

“但是您却叫他上前线，妈妈。他走时您没哭，现在也从不埋怨，似乎您从不需要帮手。”乔不解地说。

“我把最美好的东西献给我热爱的祖国，一直到他走后才让眼泪流出来。我为何要埋怨呢？我俩只是尽了应尽的责任而已，而且最终一定会因此而更加幸福。我似乎不需要帮助，那是因为我有一个比父亲更好的朋友在安慰我，支持我。孩子，你生活中的烦恼和诱惑在露头，而且可能还会有许多，只要感受到天父的力量和仁爱，正如你感受到地上的父爱一样，你就能战胜它们，超越它们。你对天父之爱越深，信任越大，你就觉得与他越接近，对世俗的力量和智慧依赖就少。天父的慈爱和关怀旷日持久，永远与你同在，它是人生平和、幸福和力量的源泉。坚守这个信念，向上帝尽情倾诉种种苦恼、希望、悲伤和罪过吧，就像你向妈妈倾诉一样。”

乔的唯一反应是紧紧拥抱母亲。随后是沉默，她做了最虔诚的祈祷，做到心如止水，说话便是多余的了；在那悲喜交加的时刻，她不仅懂得了后悔和失望的痛苦，也体会到了自我否定和自我控制的愉悦。在母亲的引导下，她与天父更近了。天父用爱欢迎每一个孩子，这种爱比任何父爱更强烈，比任何母爱更温柔。

艾美在睡梦中动了一下，叹了口气。乔抬头看去，脸上泛起了从未有过的表情，恨不得马上就修正自己的过错。

“我一生气就见不到太阳，我不愿原谅她，今天要不是劳里，就一切都追悔莫及。我怎么会这么缺德？”乔不由得说出声来。她俯身看着妹妹，并轻轻地抚摸着散落在枕头上的湿头发。

艾美似乎听到了，睁开眼睛，伸出双臂，面带笑容，这一笑犹如一股暖流直达乔的心田。两人什么都没说，只是隔着毯子紧紧地互相拥抱，真是一吻泯怨仇。

第九章　美格涉足名利场


“那帮孩子现在出麻疹，真是天赐良机。”美格说。这是四月的一天，她在房间里整理出门做客的行李，妹妹们围在身边。

“安妮·莫法特真好，说话算话。整整两个礼拜玩它个痛快。”乔一边答道，一边伸长胳膊把几件裙子叠起来，样子活像一架风车。

“天气也很好，喜欢这样。”贝丝接着说，从她的宝贝箱子里仔细地挑出几条领圈和发带，借给美格去参加这次重要聚会。

“但愿是我出去过好日子，戴上所有这些漂亮的东西。”艾美说。她嘴里衔了一包针，美观地插入姐姐的针垫里。

“但愿你们都去，可那不可能，只能回来时再说故事了。你们对我这么好，把东西借给我，又帮我整理东西，这点小事肯定能办到。”美格说着，扫视了一下房间，最后把目光落在简单的行李上，可这在她们眼里几乎是完美的了。

“妈妈从百宝箱里拿出了什么给你？”艾美问。马奇太太有个杉木箱子，里头装着几件曾经辉煌时的旧物，准备到时候送给女儿们。那天打开箱子时，艾美不在场。

“一双长筒丝袜，那把漂亮的雕花扇子，还有可爱的蓝色腰带。我原想要那件紫罗兰色的真丝裙子，来不及改制了，只好穿我那条旧塔勒坦纱裙。”

“穿在我的新薄纱裙子外面很配，衬上腰带就更漂亮了。真后悔我的珊瑚手镯给砸坏了，不然你可以戴上。”乔说。她慷慨大方，什么都肯出借，只是东西大都破旧不堪，派不上什么用场。

“百宝箱里有一套漂亮的旧式珍珠首饰，但妈妈说鲜花才是年轻姑娘最美丽的饰物，而劳里答应我要什么就送什么。”美格回答，“来，让我看看，这是新的灰色旅行衣——把羽毛卷进我帽子里，贝丝——那是礼拜天和小型晚会穿的府绸裙子——春天穿显得沉了点，对吧？如果是紫罗兰色的真丝裙子就好了，唉！”

“不要紧，参加大型晚会还有塔勒坦连衣裙呢，再说，你穿白衣裳就像个天使。”艾美说道，望着那一小堆漂亮衣饰，心驰神往。

“不是低领，裙摆拖曳效果也不够，但也只好将就一下了。我那件蓝色家居服倒是挺好，翻了新，还刚刚镶了饰边，感觉和新的一样。我的丝绸宽松衫一点都不时髦，帽子也不像萨莉那顶。我原不想多说，但我对自己的伞失望极了。原叫妈妈买一把白柄黑伞，她却忘了，带回一把黄柄绿伞。这把伞结实精致，不该抱怨，但跟安妮那把金顶绸伞相比，就要无地自容了。”美格叹息着，极不满意地审视着那把小伞。

“去把它换了。”乔提议。

“我不会这么傻，妈为我花钱已经很不容易了，不想伤她的心。这只是我的荒唐想法罢了，不会陷进去的。丝袜和两双新手套足慰平生。你把自己的借给我，真是好妹妹。我有两双新的，旧的也洗得干干净净，平常使用，觉得已经十分富裕气派了。”美格又朝她放手套的盒子瞥了一眼，情绪大涨。

“安妮·莫法特的晚礼帽上头，有几个蓝色和粉红蝴蝶结，你可以帮我打上几个吗？”她问，这时贝丝拿来一堆刚刚从汉娜手中接过的雪白薄纱。

“不，不好，因为漂亮的帽子跟没有饰边的素净衣服不配。”乔断然说道。

“不知道到底我有没有福气穿有真花边的衣服、戴打蝴蝶结的帽子呢？”美格热切地说。

“那天你还说，只要可以去安妮·莫法特家，就心满意足了。”贝丝轻声评论。

“是说过的！哦，我是很满足，不会烦恼了。似乎人得到的越多，胃口也就越大，对不？噢，行了，隔底放好了，一切齐备，就剩舞会礼服了，那要等妈来收拾。”美格说着，眼光从装得半满的行李箱落到熨补过多次、她郑重其事地称为“舞会礼服”的白色塔勒坦薄纱裙上，心情愉快起来。

第二天天气晴朗，美格气派地出发了，去领略两个礼拜的新奇乐趣。马奇太太好不容易同意，生怕美格回来时对家里会更加不满意。但美格极力恳求，而且萨莉也答应照顾她；再说，整个冬天美格都在做烦闷的工作，出去消遣一下也是一大快事。最后，母亲终于做出让步，答应让女儿去初次品尝时尚生活的滋味。

莫法特家确实很赶时髦，楼房富丽堂皇，主人优雅端庄，纯朴的美格见了心里发虚。尽管那家过的是浮夸生活，可她们待人热忱，没过多久，这位客人便不再拘束。不知为什么，美格隐隐感到，她们教养有限，智力一般，而且阔气掩盖不了平庸的本质。当然，乘漂亮的马车，每天都锦衣华服，一个劲儿地玩乐，这样养尊处优的日子很惬意，也正合美格的心意。不久，美格便开始学着周围人的言谈举止，摆点小架子，装腔作势，说话时还带几句法语，把头发卷曲，把衣服改小，尽可能评论流行时尚。安妮·莫法特的漂亮东西，美格看得越多越眼红，也越渴望发财。现在想起来，自己家徒四壁，工作也格外艰辛，尽管有新手套和真丝长袜，可她还是觉得自己一无所有，深感委屈。

不过，她没有太多的时间抱怨，因为这三位小姑娘在忙于享受“美好时光”。她们白天逛商店、散步、骑马、探亲访友；晚上，上戏院、看歌剧或者在家里嬉闹。安妮交友甚广，深知待客之道。她的姐姐们都是漂亮小姐，其中一位已经订婚，美格觉得订婚是极有趣极浪漫的。莫法特先生是位富态乐天的老绅士，与美格的父亲相识；莫法特太太也是位肥胖、快乐的老太太，她跟女儿一样十分喜欢美格。所有人都宠爱她，亲切地称她为“黛茜”，宠得美格真有点头脑发热。

到了“小舞会”的那天晚上，她发现别人都穿上了薄薄的衣服，打扮得漂漂亮亮的，相比之下，自己的府绸衣服根本不行。于是塔勒坦纱裙出场了，可与萨莉挺括崭新的塔勒坦裙子一比，立刻显得陈旧不堪、又皱又破。美格看到姑娘们瞥了一眼，接着面面相觑，面颊顿时涨得通红，因为尽管她生性温柔，毕竟自尊心十足。大家一个字都没说，可萨莉提出帮她梳理头发，安妮提出为她系腰带，贝尔，就是已经订婚的那位姐姐，称赞她手臂洁白。在美格看来，她们的好意只不过是同情她贫穷。她心情十分沉重，独自站在一边，而其他人有说有笑，还像翩翩蝴蝶到处飞奔。美格正感到十分难受痛苦时，女佣送来一盒鲜花。没等她开口，安妮就揭开盖子。看到里面这些美丽的玫瑰、杜鹃和绿蕨，众人都惊叫起来。

“肯定是给贝尔的，乔治经常给她送的。这些花真的令人陶醉。”安妮深深地闻了一下鲜花，大声咋呼。

“那位先生说，这些花是送给马奇小姐的。这儿有张纸条。”女佣插话道，说着把纸条递给美格。

“多有意思！会是谁送的呢？以前并不知道你有情人。”姑娘们呼喊着，纷纷围住美格，显得十分好奇。

“纸条是妈妈写的，花是劳里送的。”美格简单地说。不过，她心里非常感激劳里没有忘记她。

“真的啊！”安妮说，脸上带着一种滑稽的表情。美格把纸条塞进口袋，把它当作战胜嫉妒、名利和孤傲的法宝。寥寥数语充满深情，她感觉好多了，美丽的鲜花更使她高兴起来。

美格几乎恢复了愉快的心情，她拈出几支绿蕨和玫瑰留给自己，随即将剩下的分成几把精美的花束，分赠给朋友们点缀在胸前、头发和衣裙上。她做得这么漂亮，大姐克拉拉不禁称她为“她所见到的最甜美的小家伙”，众人也为她的小小心意所感动。这一善举把她的沮丧心情打发走了。大家都跑到莫法特太太跟前展览去了，她独个儿把几支绿蕨插在自己的鬈发上，又把几朵玫瑰在裙子上别好，这时裙子在心目中变得不那么难看了，一照镜子，看到了一张喜气洋洋、双目明亮的脸孔。

那天晚上，她玩得很痛快，尽情地跳舞。所有人都很热情，她获得了三次赞扬。安妮请她唱歌，有人称赞她嗓子非常甜美；林肯少校问那位“长着漂亮眼睛、充满青春活力的小姑娘”是谁；还有晚上，莫法特先生坚持要请她跳舞，说她“不拖泥带水，舞步轻盈”，他说得极为动听。总之，她度过了一段美好的时光。后来，无意中听到一些议论，她不禁方寸大乱。当时，她正坐在暖房门口，等舞伴给她送冰淇淋，突然听到花墙的另一边有个声音问：

“她多大了？”

“我想，也就十六七岁吧。”另一个声音回答。

“那些姑娘中总有一个会碰到这种绝妙好事，你说对吧？听萨莉说，他们现在关系很亲密，老先生也很溺爱她们。”

“我敢说，马奇太太自有打算，虽然早了点，可这把牌她会打得很好。显然，姑娘们还没想到这一点呢。”莫法特太太说。

“她刚才在胡扯，说纸条是她妈写的，好像她已经知道了。可鲜花送来的时候，你看她的脸都红成什么样子了。可怜的人哪！要是她打扮得入时一点，确实很漂亮。要是我们在礼拜四把衣服借给她，你觉得她会生气吗？”另一个声音问。

“她很高傲，不过，我想不会介意的，毕竟她只有那条难看的塔勒坦布裙子。今天晚上她可能会撕破裙子，那样就有理由借给她一条像样的裙子啦。”

“再说吧。我要去邀请小劳伦斯，当然是特意为了她，到时我们就等着看好戏吧。”

这边，美格的舞伴过来了，发现她脸色通红，且神色颇为不安。听了刚才这些话，她感到既屈辱又气又恶心。她确实很高傲，那时也幸亏这样，她才没有发作。她再天真无邪，可还是能明白朋友们的这些闲话。她努力忘记它，可就是忘不掉，心头一直萦绕着“马奇太太自有打算”“胡扯”“难看的塔勒坦布裙子”这些字句。她真想痛哭一场，然后飞奔回家，把苦恼告诉家人，求教于她们。可做不到，她只能强颜欢笑。由于她显得神情激动，倒并没有露出半点破绽来，没人想得到她是在强装笑脸。她很高兴舞会终于结束了，便静静地躺在床上，思考、疑惑、气愤，一直想到头痛，还有几滴凉丝丝的眼泪落在热辣辣的脸颊上。那些荒唐的好意之言，为美格打开了一个新的世界，在此之前，她一直都在旧的天地里孩子般地快乐生活，可这些闲话扰乱了那份宁静。她与劳里纯真的友谊也因为这些无聊话而被玷污了，她对母亲的信任也因莫法特太太小肚鸡肠的一席世故话而有些许动摇。她原以为自己是穷人家的女儿，应满足于朴素的穿着，想不到姑娘们无端怜悯，把邋遢衣服看成是天底下最大的灾难。她的理性决断遭到削弱。

可怜的美格一夜辗转反侧，起床时眼皮沉重，心情极坏。她既怨自己的朋友无事生非，又愧自己不敢坦白真相，以正视听。那天早上，姑娘们全都懒懒散散，直到中午时分才提起劲头打毛线。美格马上意识到，她的朋友们举止异常。她们待她更加敬重，对她的言谈十分关注，并且用颇好奇的眼光看着她。这一切令她既惊奇又得意，只是无法理解。最后，贝尔写字时抬起头来，伤感地说：

“黛茜，亲爱的，我给你男友劳伦斯先生送了一份请帖，请他礼拜四过来。我们也想认识认识他，这可是特意为你而请的哟。”

美格红了脸，但她突然想捉弄一下这些姑娘们，于是装作一本正经地回答：

“你们的心意我领了，只是恐怕他不会来。”

“为什么，chérie[1]? ”贝尔小姐问。

“他太老了。”

“孩子，你说什么？请问，他究竟有多大年纪？”克拉拉小姐嚷道。

“差不多七十了吧，我想。”美格答道，数数打了多少针，拼命忍住笑。

“你这狡猾的家伙！我们指的当然是年轻的那位。”贝尔小姐笑了，喊道。

“哪里有什么年轻人！劳里只是个小男孩。”姐妹们听到美格这样形容自己的所谓“情人”，不禁互相使了个古怪的眼色，美格见状也笑了。

“和你年纪相仿。”南妮说。

“和我乔妹妹年纪差不多，我八月份就十七了。”美格把头一仰，答道。

“他真棒，给你送鲜花，对吧？”不识趣的安妮还在说。

“对，他经常这样做，送给我们全家人，因为他们家里多的是，而我们又是这么喜欢鲜花。你们知道，我妈和劳伦斯老先生是朋友，两家孩子在一起玩，是相当自然的事情。”美格希望她们住嘴。

“显然黛茜还没有进入社交圈。”克拉拉小姐朝贝尔点点头说。

“田园乡间，天真无邪。”贝尔小姐耸耸肩说道。

“我准备出门给我家姑娘们买点东西，各位小姐要我捎点什么吗？”穿着一身镶边绸裙子的莫法特太太像头大笨象一样缓缓走进屋来，问道。

“不用费心了，太太，”萨莉回答，“我礼拜四已经有一条粉红色的新绸裙子，什么都不缺了。”

“我也不——”美格欲言又止，她突然想到，自己确实想要几样东西，却得不到。

“那天你穿什么？”萨莉问。

“还是那条白色的旧裙子，要是我能把它补得能见人的话，昨晚可惜给撕破了。”美格想尽量讲得自然，却感到很不自在。

“为什么不捎信回家再要一条？”不善鉴貌辨色的萨莉追问道。

“只有这一条嘛。”美格好不容易才说出这话。但萨莉仍然没有明白过来，她友好地惊叫起来：

“只有那么一条？真好笑——”她的话没说完，贝尔赶忙朝她摇头，插进来友善地说：

“不好笑，她又不进社交圈，要这么多衣服有什么用？黛茜，即使你有一打，也不必跟家里要。我有一条漂亮的蓝色绸裙子，我已经穿不下，白白搁着，不如你来穿上，遂遂我的心意，好吗，乖乖？”

“谢谢你的好意，但如果你们不在意，我倒不在乎穿旧裙子，像我这样的小姑娘，再适合不过了。”美格说。

“请你一定让我把你打扮得气派一点。我就喜欢这样做。上下打扮齐整了，你准是个标准的小美人。我要把你打扮好了，才让你见人，然后我们像灰姑娘和仙姑参加舞会一样突然亮相。”贝尔用富有说服力的声调说。

美格无法拒绝如此友善的提议，她很想看看，自己打扮后是否会变成个小美人，于是点头同意，把原来对莫法特一家不舒服的感觉抛在脑后。

礼拜四晚上，贝尔和女佣关起门来，一起把美格打扮成漂亮小姐。她们把美格的头发烫弯，脖子和胳膊上扑了香粉，为了使双唇更红润，又涂了深红色的唇膏，要不是美格反抗，女佣霍滕斯还要给她抹一点胭脂。她们给她套上天蓝色的裙子，裙子紧得让她都透不过气来，而且领口很低，正派的美格站在镜子前，看着自己一个劲儿地脸红。接着她们又给她戴上一套银首饰：手镯、项链、胸针，还有耳环，霍滕斯用一根细得看不见的粉红色丝线把它们都串在一起。胸前戴上一束香水月季花苞，还有一条褶裥花边遮着。美格终于同意露出楚楚动人的洁白双肩，再加一双蓝色高跟绸靴，令她心满意足。拿上一块镶有花边的手帕、一把羽毛扇和银夹子夹着的一束鲜花，她打扮齐整了。贝尔小姐满意地审视美格，就像一个小姑娘端详打扮一新的玩偶。

“小姐真charmante, très jolie1[2]，不是吗？”霍滕斯做作地拍手欢叫。

“出去让大家瞧瞧吧。”贝尔小姐说，一边领美格去见在房间里等着的姑娘们。

美格拖着长裙跟在后面，裙子窸窣有声，耳环叮当作响，鬈发上下波动，心儿怦怦猛跳。刚才那面镜子已明明白白地告诉她，自己是个小美人，她觉得似乎她的“好戏”真的已经开始了。朋友们热情洋溢，反复说着溢美之词；她站在那里好一阵，好像寓言里的鹩哥，尽情享受着借来的羽毛，众人则像一班喜鹊，唧唧喳喳地叫个不停。

“南妮，趁我换衣裳，你教她走步，别让她被裙子和法式高跟鞋绊倒了。克拉拉，你用银蝴蝶发卡，把她左鬓的那绺长鬈发夹起来。你们谁也别弄糟了我这一手漂亮功夫啊。”贝尔说着匆匆走开，对自己的成功显得相当得意。

“我不敢走下去，觉得头晕目眩，身子僵硬，好像只穿了一半衣服。”美格对萨莉说。此时铃声响起，莫法特太太派人来请小姐们立即赴会。

“大不一样咯，不过这样很漂亮。跟你比，我都无地自容了。瞧，贝尔多有品位，当然你也蛮有法国人的味道，真的。就让花这么挂着，不用太在意，当心摔倒。”萨莉说着，努力装出一副不在乎美格掠美的样子。

玛格丽特牢记这个告诫，安然下楼，缓缓地走入客厅，莫法特一家和几位早到的客人都聚集在那里。她很快发现，华丽的衣服有一种魅力，总能吸引某类人的注目礼。有几位小姐以前从不注意她，可一下子热情起来；几位年轻绅士在上一场舞会中只是盯了她一眼，而现在他们不光是盯着她看，还要求与她认识，对她讲了各种愚蠢的贴心话；还有几位老太太坐在沙发上，喜欢对大家品头论足，也饶有兴趣地打听她的身份。只听莫法特太太对其中的一位说：

“黛茜·马奇的父亲是上校军官，是我们家的远亲，可现在家道中落，可惜吧？她们也是劳伦斯家的密友，告诉你，她可温柔着呢，我家内德对她可痴迷呢。”

“啊！原来是这样。”老太太说着，戴上眼镜又把美格审视了一遍。美格假装没听到，心里还是很吃惊，莫法特太太竟然胡说八道。

头晕目眩的感觉还没有消失，可美格想象自己就是在扮演一位优雅小姐的新角色，因此她表现颇为得体；哪怕裙子太紧，束得她两肋隐隐作痛，脚底下不断地踩着裙裾；尽管她还胆战心惊，唯恐那对耳环会甩出去，弄丢或者摔破。旁边一个小绅士正在想方设法卖弄诙谐，讲着一些并不可笑的笑话，她摇着扇子咯咯地笑。突然，笑声戛然而止，只见她不知所措。因为，就在对面，她看见了劳里。他盯着她，毫不掩饰心中的诧异，且不以为然。这她感觉得到，尽管劳里屈身鞠躬，面带笑容，可他真诚的双眼里流露出一种目光，使她脸红，都怪自己没穿上旧裙子。她看到，贝尔胳膊肘推推安妮，然后两个人都把目光转向劳里，这使她心里更加烦乱。好在劳里生性腼腆，看上去特别像个孩子，她才放宽心。

“这些人真无聊，都想到哪里去了！反正我不在乎，也丝毫不会变色的。”美格心想，赶忙窸窸窣窣地跨过房间去和朋友握手。

“你能来我很高兴，本来还怕你不来了。”她装出一副大人的口气说。

“是乔要我来的，回去还要汇报你打扮得怎样，于是我就来了。”劳里回答，眼睛并没有朝她看，只是暗自取笑她的母亲般口吻。

“那你打算怎么跟她说呢？”美格问。她急切想知道他对自己怎么看，可心里第一次感到忐忑不安。

“我想说，都认不出来了。你看上去这么像大人，实在不像你自己了，我很害怕这种陌生。”他说着，抚摸着手套上的扣子。

“真荒唐！姑娘们把我打扮成这模样，是觉得好玩，我也挺喜欢的。要是乔看到的话，她会不会盯着我看？”美格问，一心想要他说出她这个样子是否比以前有长进。

“是的，我想她会的。”劳里黯然地回答。

“难道你不喜欢我这样吗？”美格问。

“我不喜欢。”劳里生硬地答道。

“为什么？”美格急切地问。

他扫了一眼鬈鬈的头发，裸露的肩膀，花里胡哨的裙子，回答中不见了往常彬彬有礼的风度，那种神情更使美格窘迫不安。

“我不欣赏过分炫耀。”

这话竟然出自比她年轻的小伙子之口，美格怎么也听不下去。于是她走开了，冷冷地扔下一句话：“从没见过你这样无礼的男孩子。”

美格火冒三丈，她来到一个没人的窗口，站在那里让凉风吹拂火辣辣的脸颊，紧绷的裙子绷得她脸色通红，极不舒服。她站在那里时，林肯少校从身旁经过。不一会儿，美格听到他跟他母亲说：“她们在戏弄那个小姑娘。我本来想让你见见她，可她们把她彻底毁了，今晚她只是个布娃娃而已。”

“哦，天哪！”美格叹了口气，“我真该放聪明点。如果　我穿上自己的衣服，那样就不会惹别人恶心，自己也不会这么不舒服。”

她把额头靠在冰凉的窗棂上面，让窗帘半掩着自己的身影，拿手的华尔兹已经开始，也全然不觉。这时，一个人碰碰她，她回过身来，看到了劳里。他一脸悔意，毕恭毕敬向她鞠了个躬，伸出手来说：

“恕我一时无礼，来和我跳个舞吧。”

“恐怕这不合你的口味吧。”美格试图装出一副生气的样子，却一点也装不出来。

“没的事情，巴不得呢。来吧，我会学好的。虽然不喜欢你的衣服，但我真的觉得你——反正漂亮极了。”他挥挥手，似乎语言还不足以表达他的仰慕之情。

美格一笑，回心转意了。当他们站在一起等着合上音乐节拍时，她悄悄说道：

“小心裙子把你绊倒，我受尽折磨，穿上它真是个戆头鹅。”

“你可以把裙摆围着领口别起来，这样它还能发挥点作用。”劳里说着，低头看看那双小蓝靴，显然对它们倒很满意。

他们敏捷而优雅地迈开舞步，由于在家里练习过，这对活泼的年轻人配合得相当默契，给舞场平添了快乐的风景线。他们欢快地旋转起舞，觉得经历了这次小口角之后，彼此更加接近了。

“劳里，我想请你帮个忙，好吗？”美格问。她刚跳一会儿便气喘吁吁地停下来，也不解释，劳里便站在一边替她扇扇子。

“那还用说！”劳里欣然回答。

“回到家里，千万不要告诉她们我今天晚上的打扮。她们不会明白这个玩笑，妈妈听到会担心的。”

“那你为什么这样做？”劳里的眼睛显然是在这样问。美格急得又说：

“我会亲自把一切告诉她们，向妈妈坦白我有多傻。但我宁愿自己来说，你别说，行吗？”

“我向你保证守口如瓶，只是她们问我时该怎样回答？”

“就说我看上去挺好，玩得很开心。”

“第一项我会全心全意地说的，只是第二项怎么说？你看上去并不像玩得开心，不是吗？”劳里盯着她，那种神情促使她悄声说道：

“是，刚才是不开心。不要以为我那么讨厌。我只是想找乐子，但我发现这种乐子毫无益处，我已经开始厌倦了。”

“内德·莫法特过来了，他想干什么？”劳里边说边皱起黑色的眉头，仿佛并不认为这位小主人的到来可以增加乐趣。

“他订下了三场舞，我想他是来找舞伴的。烦死人！”美格说完摆出一副倦怠的神情，把劳里也逗乐了。

他一直到晚饭时候才再跟美格说上话，当时她正跟内德和内德的朋友费希尔一起喝香槟。劳里认为那两人是一对“十足的傻瓜”，他觉得自己有权像兄弟一样监护马奇姐妹，必要时站出来保护她们。

“喝那玩意儿，明天就会头痛欲裂，我可不喝。美格，你看，你妈妈不喜欢这样的。”他在她椅边俯下身来低声说道，此时内德正转身给她续杯，费希尔则弯腰捡起了她的扇子。

“今天晚上我不是美格，而是个轻狂得无恶不作的‘布娃娃’。明天我就会收拾起这副‘过分炫耀’的嘴脸，拼命学好。”她皮笑肉不笑地答道。

“但愿明天已经到来啊。”劳里咕哝着，怏怏走开了。看到她变成这副样子，他心里很不是滋味。

美格一边跳舞一边调情卖俏，嘀嘀咕咕地聊着，傻笑着，就像别的姑娘们一样。晚饭后，她跳德国华尔兹舞，自始至终跌跌撞撞，长裙子也差点把舞伴绊倒。劳里见到她这种瞎蹦乱跳的模样心生反感。他一边看着，心里想好了一番数落的话，却没有机会发表，因为美格总是躲着他。一直到舞会结束，劳里才得机会过去向她道晚安。

“记住！”她说道，强颜欢笑着，头痛欲裂已经开始了。

“守口如瓶，至死不渝。”劳里夸张地拖着长音，转身离去。

这小小的插曲激起了安妮的好奇心，但美格累得不想再扯闲话，上床歇息了。她觉得自己像参加了一场化装舞会，却玩得并不尽兴。第二天，她整天都不舒服，到了礼拜六，就回家了。她已经被两个礼拜的玩乐弄得筋疲力尽，感到自己已经享受够了“奢侈的生活”。

“安安静静的生活真好，不用整天客套应酬。家里虽然不漂亮，可真的是舒服。”美格说，安详地左顾右盼。礼拜天晚上，她和母亲及乔坐在一起聊天。

“听到你这么说，我很高兴，乖乖。我本来还担心，你去过了豪宅，会觉得家里又破又无聊。”母亲回答，那天她不止一次地看着美格，满脸担忧的神情。其实，慈母的眼睛，一眼就能察觉孩子们脸上的丝毫变化。

美格高兴地讲了她的经历，接着一遍又一遍地重复，说她度过了一段多么美好的时光，可还是心事重重的样子。看到妹妹们都上床睡觉去了，她若有所思地坐着，两眼盯着炉火，沉默寡言，满面愁容。时钟敲响了九点，乔提出要去睡觉，美格突然站了起来，坐到贝丝的凳子上，双肘靠在母亲膝上，鼓足勇气说：

“妈咪，我要向您坦白一切。”

“早就想到了。你要说什么，乖乖？”

“要我回避吗？”乔谨慎地问。

“不用不用，我有什么事瞒过你？在小妹妹们面前我不好意思说。我在莫法特家做了不少可怕的事情，我想你们应该了解。”

“说吧。”马奇太太微笑着说，显得有些担忧。

“我已经说过，她们把我打扮起来。可我没跟你们说，她们给我抹粉、穿紧身裙、烫头发，把我弄得像个时髦女郎。劳里觉得那样不妥当，我知道他是这么想的，尽管嘴里没说。还有人叫我‘布娃娃’。我知道这样很笨，可她们讨好我，夸我是个大美人，还说了一大堆废话，于是就任由她们作弄了。”

“就这些？”乔问。马奇太太则静静地注视着漂亮女儿低垂的脸，不忍心再责备她干了那些琐碎的蠢事。

“不，我还喝了香槟，和别人戏闹追打，还学着调情，总之令人恶心。”美格责备自己。

“看样子还有吧。”马奇太太抚摸着那张娇嫩的脸。突然，美格脸色通红，支支吾吾地说：

“还有，都很无聊，想说出来，因为我最恨别人这样议论我们和劳里的关系。”

随后，她便把在莫法特家听到的闲言碎语一一讲了出来。美格说的时候，乔看到母亲咬紧嘴唇，竟有人在美格纯真的心灵里灌输这种想法，似乎令她十分不快。

“哎呀，敢说这是我听到过的最混账的废话！”乔义愤填膺得叫了起来，“你为什么不当场跳出来说个明白？”

“做不到，这太难为情了。起初是不由自主听到的，但后来我又怒又羞，倒没想起该走开了。”

“待我看到安妮·莫法特，你看我怎么教训她！什么‘早有打算’，什么对劳里好是因为他家有钱，以后会娶我们！如果我告诉他，那些无聊的东西是怎样谈论我们穷孩子的，他不叫起来才怪！”乔说着笑起来，似乎这种事情回想起来不过是个大笑话而已。

“如果你告诉劳里，我就跟你没完！不能说，对吗，妈妈？”美格焦虑地说道。

“对，千万不要重复那种愚昧的闲话，要尽快忘掉。”马奇太太严肃地说，“我让你置身于那些我了解甚少的人们中间，真是很不明智——我敢说，他们心地不坏，但精于世故，缺乏教养，对年轻人满脑子粗俗念头。我对这次出访可能对你造成的伤害，说不出有多么难过，美格。”

“不要难过，我不会因此而受伤害的。我会把坏的全抛到脑后，只记住好的，因为确实也玩得很尽兴，很感谢您让我去。我不会因此而伤心，也不会不知足，妈妈。我知道自己是个傻傻的小姑娘，我会留在您身边，直到可以自己照顾自己。不过，让人家夸赞、仰慕，心里真是美滋滋的。我还是忍不住要说心里美滋滋哩。”美格说道，对自己的坦白内容显得有点不好意思。

“这再自然不过了，如果这种美滋滋不酿成狂热，不会导致做傻事或做姑娘家不该做的事情，那就无伤大雅。要学会认识、珍惜名副其实的赞美话，用端庄美丽来激发优秀人士的敬意，美格。”

玛格丽特坐着想了一会，乔则背手而立，神情专注，又带着几分迷惑。她看到美格红着脸谈论爱慕、情人之类的东西，倒是新鲜事。乔觉得，姐姐似乎在那半个月里惊人地长大了，从她身边飘走，飘进了一个她不能跟随的世界。

“妈妈，你有没有莫法特太太所说的那类‘打算’呢？”美格含羞问道。

“有，乖乖，多着呢；凡是做母亲的都有打算，但我的打算恐怕跟莫法特太太有出入啊。我会告诉你一些。时候到了，你小脑袋、心里已经有浪漫念头，稍加点拨就会想到这种严肃的课题上来。你还小，美格，但也不至于幼稚得不明白我的话。这种话，由母亲来跟你们小姑娘说再合适不过了。乔，也许很快就会轮到你的，也一起来听听我的‘打算’吧。如果是好打算，就帮我一起执行。”

乔走过去坐到椅子扶手上，看样子她以为她们就要参加到什么极庄严的事情中去。马奇太太执着两个女儿的手，若有所思地望着两张年轻的面庞，语调严肃而轻快地说：

“我希望女儿们美丽善良，多才多艺；众人爱慕，世人敬重；青春幸福，姻缘美满。愿上帝垂爱，使她们尽量无忧无虑，生活愉快而有意义。被好男人爱上娶走，是女人一生中最大的幸事。我热切希望我的姑娘们可以有这种美丽的经历。考虑这种事情是很自然的事，美格，期望和等待也是对的，做好准备是明智的。这样，幸福时刻到来时，你才会觉得已准备担责，无愧于这种喜事。好女儿们，我对你们寄予厚望，但并不是要你们莽撞行事——仅仅为了金钱，便嫁入豪门。这些豪宅并不是家，因为里头没有爱情。金钱是必要而且宝贵的东西——如果用之有道，还是一种高贵的东西——但我决不希望你们把金钱看做首要的东西，当成唯一的奋斗目标。只要拥有爱情、幸福美满，我宁可你们成为穷人妻，也胜过没有自尊、不得安宁的皇后。”

“贝尔说，如果不主动出击，穷人家的姑娘就永远不会有机会。”美格叹息说。

“那我们就做老处女好了。”乔坚定地说。

“说得好，乔，宁愿做快乐的老处女，也不做伤心的太太或不正经的女孩子，四处乱跑找丈夫。”马奇太太坚定地说，“不要烦恼，美格。贫穷根本吓不倒真诚的恋人。我认识的优秀、高贵的夫人都是穷人家的姑娘，可这些可爱的姑娘都没有获准成为老处女。让时间来解决这些问题吧。让这个家充满欢乐，这样当你们自己成家的时候，才适合承担起自己的家庭，万一没有，也可对这个家感到知足。宝贝们，有一点要记住，妈妈永远是你们的知己，爸爸也是你们的朋友。不管女儿嫁人不嫁人，我俩都希望，也都相信她们永远是我们的骄傲和安慰。”

“我们会的，妈咪，我们会的！”姐妹俩真诚地喊道。说完，马奇太太和她们道了晚安。

第十章　匹克威克社和邮箱


春天来了，一套新的娱乐方式时兴起来。白天渐长，下午也有了更长的时间进行劳作，做各种各样的游戏。院子也该梳理了，四姐妹各有一小块地皮，可以随心所欲地打理。汉娜常说：“从烟囱边一看，就知道哪块园地是谁的。”果不其然，因为姐妹们的爱好就像性格一样千差万别。美格的地里种了玫瑰、青莲、长春花，还有一棵小橙子树。乔喜欢做实验，园圃里年年季季不同。今年种的是蓬勃向上的向日葵，葵花子送给“咯咯哒婶婶”和她的小鸡吃。贝丝的园子则是老花样，种着各式芬芳扑鼻的鲜花——香蜿豆、木樨草、飞燕草、石竹、三色堇、青莴，还有喂小鸟的繁缕，引猫咪的樟脑草。艾美的园子弄了个小凉亭，虽然弯弯扭扭，却也十分好看，上面爬满了一圈圈五颜六色的金银花和牵牛花，一朵朵、一串串挂着，颇为雅致，还有高高的白百合，娇嫩的草蕨，无奇不有，适时盛开，颇有诗情画意。

天气晴朗时，她们就搞园艺，散散步，划河船，找名花。下雨时则待在家里消遣，有旧游戏，也有新游戏，全都很有创意。其中一种叫做“匹克威克社”，因为当时流行神秘社团，她们认为也该建上一个；又因姐妹们都崇拜狄更斯，便自称“匹克威克社”。社团坚持了足足一年，只有几次中断。每到礼拜六晚上，大家便来阁楼里会合，举行社团仪式如下：三张椅子并排摆在一张桌子前面，桌上摆着一盏油灯和四个白色会徽，上面各印着不同颜色的“匹克威克”几个大字，还摆着一份名为《匹克威克文选》的周刊。四姐妹都为周刊撰稿，主编是酷爱舞文弄墨的乔。七点整，四位社员登上会所，把会徽绑在头上，郑重其事地坐下。美格最大，名号塞缪尔·匹克威克；富有文学才干的乔号曰奥古斯都·斯诺格拉斯；胖乎乎、肤色红润的贝丝号称特雷西·托曼；做事总是贪心不足的艾美号纳撒尼尔·温克尔。社长匹克威克宣读社报。报纸里头写满了独创的故事、诗歌、当地新闻、有趣的广告，以及对各人缺点错误的善意提示。这天，匹克威克先生戴上一副没有镜片的眼镜，敲一下桌子，清清嗓子，狠狠瞪一眼斜靠在椅子上的斯诺格拉斯先生，等“他”坐正了，这才开始读：

匹克威克文选





18××年5月20日





诗人角

周年纪念颂

今晚，我们再次相聚

在匹克威克大堂。

庆祝第五十二个周例，

庄严守礼，头戴徽章。





我们一个不落，

个个精神抖擞。

一张张熟悉的面孔，

握紧友爱之手。





我们恭敬地问候，

恪尽职守的匹克威克，

他鼻梁上架眼镜，

朗读我们充实的周刊。





虽然他身患感冒，

我们一样听得津津有味，

因为他吐出的沙哑字句，

全部充满了智慧。





六尺高斯诺格拉斯高高在上，

优雅的大笨象，

褐色的面孔快乐滑稽，

向伙伴们微笑。





诗歌之火照亮眼睛，

他勇敢地抗争命运。

眉宇间写着凌云壮志，

鼻子上却沾了墨水！





下面是文静的托曼，

多么红润、丰满、亲切，

听双关语笑得咳呛，

随之滚下座位。





严肃的小温克尔也在场，

根根头发都理顺，

十足的礼仪典范，

虽然他最恨洗脸。





本年已逝，我们团结着，

欢笑与共，奇文共写，

踏上文学之路，

走向盛名的荣耀。





愿社刊长盛不衰，

愿社团永续存在，

愿来年把祝福赐给

欢快实用的匹克威克社。

戴面具的婚礼

威尼斯传奇

贡朵拉[1]一艘接一艘摇过来，泊在大理石台阶下，可爱的乘客们下船，衣着华丽的人群，走进阿德龙伯爵富丽堂皇的大厅。骑士、贵妇人、小精灵、小侍从、僧侣及卖花女，全都欢快地拥入地舞池。美妙的嗓音飞扬，优美旋律不绝于耳，化装舞会在欢笑和音乐声中进行。

“殿下今晚见到维奥拉小姐了吗？”殷勤的行吟诗人问正靠在他臂膀上、在大厅里翩翩起舞的仙后。

“见到了，真是可爱，但悲哀不堪！她的裙子也选得好，下个礼拜，就要嫁给她切齿痛恨的安东尼奥伯爵了。”

“说实话，我嫉妒他。他从那边走过来了，打扮得像个新郎，除了黑色面具。摘下面具后，我们就知道他对那位无法赢得芳心，却被严父许配给他的漂亮姑娘有什么看法了。”行吟诗人说。

“风闻她爱上了踏破她家门槛的年轻的英国艺术家，却遭到老伯爵拒绝。”女士边舞边说。

舞会达到了高潮，牧师出现了，把这对年轻人带到挂着紫色天鹅绒帘幕的壁龛前，示意他们跪下。欢乐的人群立即静下来，只听到喷泉的水声和橙林在月光下发出沙沙声。这时阿德龙伯爵说道：

“各位贵族名媛，请原谅我设下此计，请你们来见证小女的婚礼。神父，我们静候仪式开始。”

众目睽睽，一起投向新郎新娘，人群中响起了惊奇的窃窃私语，因为一双新人都没有摘下面具。大家心里异常惊奇，但出于礼仪都三缄其口。待神圣的婚礼结束，心急的观众便围着伯爵刨根问底。

“我是知无不言，只知道这是害羞的维奥拉出的怪点子，也只好由她了。好了，孩子们，游戏到此为止，摘下面具，接受我的祝福吧。”

但两人并没有下跪，年轻的新郎摘下面具，露出艺术家情人费迪南德·德弗罗气质高贵的面孔。他胸佩一枚闪闪发亮的英国伯爵星徽，可爱的维奥拉幸福地倚在他的怀里，魅力四射，神采飞扬。新郎的回答，语惊四座：

“岳丈大人，您曾轻蔑地对我说，等到和安东尼奥伯爵齐名，并和他一样阔气的那一天再来娶您的女儿。我超额完成了，即使您的野心也拒绝不了德弗罗和德维尔伯爵。姓氏千古流传，家财富可敌国，和这位漂亮的小姐，也即我的妻子缔结姻缘，到底配不配？”

老伯爵站在那里如雕塑一般。费迪南德转向迷惑不解的人群，带着胜利的微笑喜悦地说道：“勇敢的朋友们，我祝愿你们求婚也能像我一样马到成功，祝福你们也能用这种戴面具的婚礼，和我一样娶得美丽新娘归。”

南瓜记

从前，农夫在园子里栽下一粒小种子。不久种子破土而出，长成藤蔓，结了许多南瓜。十月的一天，瓜熟蒂落。他摘下一个带到集市。杂货商人买下，把瓜放在店堂里。当天早上，戴棕色帽子、穿蓝色裙子、圆脸扁鼻的小姑娘来替妈妈把瓜买去。她把瓜拖回家，切好放在大锅里煮。其中一些拌上盐和黄油捣烂，用作晚餐。其余的加上一品脱牛奶、两个鸡蛋、四调羹糖、肉豆蔻和脆饼片，然后放在碗里烘烤，直到色泽金黄、香味扑鼻为止。第二天，便被姓“马奇”的一家子吃掉了。

不幸事故

上礼拜五，地窖里传来强烈的震动声，惨叫声紧接而至，我们大惊，一起冲进地窖，发现尊敬的社长大人倒卧地上，原来是在搬木柴烧火时绊了一跤。我们看到满目狼藉，匹克威克先生跌倒时，没头没脑投入水桶，带翻了一小桶液体皂，泼在强壮的身躯上，衣服也撕烂了。把他抬出险境后，发现他并未受伤，只是擦破了几处皮而已。现在，可以高兴地告诉大家，他一切如常。

痛失爱猫

我们有责任怀着痛苦把这件事记录下来：我们珍贵的朋友雪球·帕特·鲍太太突然神秘失踪。这只漂亮可爱的猫是一大班仰慕她的热心朋友的宠儿，她的美丽引人注目，她的优雅姿态和良好品德赢得了大家的欢心。众人无不为失去她而深感痛惜。

最后一次见到她时，她正坐在门边，盯着屠夫的运货马车。据推测，可能某个歹徒垂涎于她的美色，卑鄙地把她偷走。

几个星期已经过去，猫儿仍然无影无踪。我们放弃了一切希望，在她的篮子系上黑绸带，把她的盘子放到一边，并为失去她而痛哭流涕。



* * *



一位富有同情心的朋友寄来如下美文：





挽歌

悼雪球·帕特·鲍





我们哀悼小猫的丢失，

叹息她命运多舛。

火炉边再见不到她的身影，

绿旧门边也没有她玩耍。





她的夭孩长眠的小坟，

是栗树下的一抔净土；

我们却无缘在她坟前悲泣，

不知道她归葬何处。





她空着的床，她闲置的球，

再也见不到主人归来；

轻柔的步拍，悦耳的喵叫，

不再从门边传来。





又有猫来捉鼠，

那是个脏面孔；

不像我们的爱猫洒脱，

玩耍也不如她飘逸。





她在雪球玩过的大厅，

悄悄溜来溜去。

但她对狗只是呼噜叫，

而我们宠儿勇敢把狗驱。





温顺尽力，也有用场，

但模样却不雅；

你在我们心中的崇高位置，

她怎么能及？

一周总结

美格——良。

乔——差。

贝丝——优。

艾美——中。





社长读完报（请读者相信，这是当年一班真诚的女孩子编写的报刊的善本），社员们发出一轮掌声，接着斯诺格拉斯先生起身提议。

“社长先生，各位先生，”“他”摆出一副国会议员的架势，语气庄重地说，“我提议接纳一位新社员——一位实至名归、受人尊重的好人，能够将本社精神发扬光大、提高社刊的文学价值的快乐有趣的人士。我提议西奥多·劳伦斯先生成为匹克威克社的名誉社员。来吧，就欢迎他吧。”

见乔突然改变腔调，姑娘们都笑了起来，但大家都显得有点顾虑，斯诺格拉斯落座的时候大家都不做声。

“我们投票决定吧，”社长说，“赞成这项动议的请说：‘同意’。”

斯诺格拉斯首先大叫一声，使众人吃惊的是，贝丝接着也羞答答地表了态。

“持反对意见的请说：‘反对’。”

美格和艾美持反对意见。只见温克尔先生站起来，振振有词地说道：“不想要男孩子，他们只会取笑我们，而且东奔西跳。这是女子社团，希望有隐私，规规矩矩。”

“我担心他会笑话我们的报刊，进而取笑我们。”匹克威克扯着额前的一小绺鬈发说道。她拿不定主意的时候便这样做。

斯诺格拉斯一跃而起，十分认真。“先生，我以绅士的名义向你保证，劳里根本不会这样做的。他喜欢写作，他会使我们的稿子另添一种格调，让我们不用多愁善感，你明白吗？他帮了我们许多忙，我们无以为报。我想起码可以为他提供一席之地，欢迎他入社。”

这番关于受恩回报的巧妙暗示，使托曼站起身来，她似乎下定了决心。

“对，应该这样，哪怕我们担心也好。依我看，他可以入社，他爷爷也可以，如果他愿意的话。”

贝丝脱口而出，掷地有声，社员们个个动容，乔离座赞许地与她握手。“好了，再投一次票。大家记住这是我们的劳里，说：‘同意！'”斯诺格拉斯激动地叫道。

“同意！同意！同意！”三姐妹异口同声地回答。

“好极了！主保佑你们！现在，正如温克尔那富有个性的说法，最好是‘抓紧时间的牛鼻子’，好，请允许我请出新社员。”乔一把拉开柜门，只见劳里坐在一个布袋上，脸色通红，强忍住笑，双眼闪闪发亮，众人大为沮丧。

“你这淘气鬼！你这叛徒！乔，你怎么可以这样？”三个姑娘喊道。斯诺格拉斯得意扬扬地把朋友带上前来，拿出一把椅子和一个会徽，瞬间安置妥当。

“你们两个坏蛋真是厚颜无耻，令人吃惊。”匹克威克先生道，试图皱起蛾眉，却化作了温柔一笑。不过，新社员善于随机应变。他站起来，向社长优雅地行了个礼，风度迷人地演说道：“社长先生和女士们——请原谅，先生们——请允许在下自我介绍：山姆·维勒，愿为会社效犬马之劳。”

“好！好！”乔大声说，把靠着的旧暖炉把手敲碰得山响。

“我忠实的朋友和高贵的恩人，”劳里挥挥手说，“那位把我溢美地介绍给各位的人，今晚的卑鄙计谋不能怪她。是我出的主意。磨了很久她才让步的。”

“得了，别大包大揽了，你知道藏柜子里头是我出的主意。”斯诺格拉斯打断他的话，觉得这个玩笑十分有趣。

“别信她瞎说，我才是冒失鬼，先生，”新社员向匹克威克先生行了个维勒式的点头礼，说道，“不过我用名誉担保，下不为例，从今往后我要为这个不朽的会社鞠躬尽瘁。”

“听哪！听哪！”乔叫道，把暖炉盖当作铙钹乱敲一气。

“往下说，往下说！”温克尔和托曼说道，社长则温厚地一躬身子。

“我只想说，承蒙厚爱，不胜惶恐，为略表感激之情，为加强睦邻友好关系，我在花园中地势较低的那个角落的树篱里设了一个邮箱。是间宽敞漂亮的小屋，各道门都上了挂锁，鸿雁往来，方便至极——恕我说粗话，女人也可以往来的。原是一间旧燕屋，但我已把门堵上，把屋顶打开，各种物件都可以放，可节省宝贵的时间。那些信件、手稿、书籍、包裹等等，都可以在那里传递，两家各执钥匙一枚，相信这样一定妙不可言。请允许我献上这把钥匙，衷心感谢各位的厚意，并承蒙赐座。”

维勒先生把一枚小钥匙放在桌上，热烈的掌声响起，坐下时大家又一通鼓掌，暖炉当当作响，乱晃一气，秩序好一会才恢复过来。接着是长时间的讨论，大家充分发挥，个个表现得出人意料，会议开得异常活跃，很晚才在为新社员发出的三下欢呼声中结束。对于吸收山姆·维勒入社，大家从不感到后悔，因为他态度专注，表现出色，活泼快乐，是难得的社员。他无疑补充了会议的生气，给社刊增添了一种格调，因为他的演说震撼人心，文稿风格优美经典，富有爱国心，而且滑稽生动，从不多愁善感。乔觉得这些文章堪可媲美培根、弥尔顿、莎士比亚的大作，认为其对自己的作品也有影响。

邮箱确实是高招，业务十分繁忙，足以媲美真邮局，因为各种各样离奇古怪的东西都经那里传递：悲剧、领结、诗歌、泡菜、花草籽、长信、乐谱、姜饼、橡皮擦、邀请函、训斥信，还有小狗，等等。连老先生都感到有趣，也送一些古怪包裹、神秘字条和滑稽的电报来凑热闹；而他那位迷上汉娜魅力的园丁，竟送了一封情书让乔转交。秘密泄露时，大家笑得前仰后合，绝没有想到，这个小小的邮箱，日后还会装上多少情书啊！

第十一章　试验


“六月一号！金家明天就去海边度假，我没事了。整整三个月的假期，我真是太幸福了！”美格赞叹道。这天天气暖和，美格刚刚回到家里，只见乔躺在沙发上，显得疲惫不堪，贝丝替她脱下肮脏的靴子，艾美正在榨柠檬汁，为大家提神。

“马奇姑婆今天也走了，哦，我真是高兴呀！”乔说，“我本来怕得要命，就怕她叫我陪着去，要是真的叫我，我倒也没办法。要知道，梅园死气沉沉，简直就像教堂里的墓地，能不去就不去。为把老太太送走，我真忙乱了，每次她开口，我都感到害怕。为了早点把她打发走，我干得特别起劲，显得特别亲热，可就怕她舍不得和我分开。她总算上了马车，我这才松了口气。谁知最后又吓了一跳，马车刚要走，她伸出头说：‘约瑟芬，你能不能——? ’我转身落荒而逃，下面的话也没听到，直到转弯处，这颗心才放下来。”

“可怜的乔，她进来的时候好像后面有几只狗熊在追赶。”贝丝边说边把姐姐的双脚慈爱地抱在怀里。

“马奇姑婆真是个十足的海蓬子，可不是吗？”艾美一边评论道，一边挑剔地品尝混合饮料。

“她是说吸血鬼[1]，不是海草。不过这没关系，反正天热了，也不必对用词太在意。”乔咕哝着说。

“整整一个假期，你们打算怎么过？”艾美问，她机灵地把话题一转。

“我要睡懒觉，最好什么都不做。”美格陷坐在摇椅上回答，“一个冬天了，都是一早就被叫醒，又整天都得替人家干活。我现在要休息，痛痛快快地玩个够。”

“不行。”乔说，“我可不想老是睡觉。我已经搬来了一大堆书，要充实一下这美好时光，就坐在老苹果树上读书，或者去玩乐——”

“不要说‘玩乐’! ”艾美恳求道。因为乔纠正了“海蓬子”，这回艾美也要奚落一下乔，作为报复。

“那就说‘玩唱’吧，和劳里一起，那样总算妥当，够确切了吧，反正他的歌声婉转动听。”

“我们别做功课了，贝丝。只是暂时的，玩个痛快，好好休息，女孩子就应该这样嘛。”艾美提议。

“好吧，我会的，要是妈妈不反对。我想学几首新歌。我的那几个孩子也要重新打扮度暑假，他们没有衣服，乱得要命。”

“可以吗，妈妈？”美格转向马奇太太问。马奇太太坐在被姑娘们称为“妈咪角”的地方，正在做缝纫。

“你们可以试着过一个礼拜，看看感觉如何。我想，到礼拜六晚上，你们会发现，光玩不工作其实和光工作不玩一样糟糕。”

“噢！天哪！不会吧！光玩不工作肯定很痛快。”美格得意地说。

“现在我提议大家干一杯，我‘朋友和伙伴甘普[2]’就这么说过。祝我们永远快乐，不用干活！”这时柠檬汁递了过来，乔站起身，手举杯子高声祝酒。

她们痛快地一饮而尽。接着试验开始了，大家懒洋洋地打发了那天剩下的时光。第二天上午，美格到了十点钟才露面，她一个人吃早饭，只觉得真没味道。乔没有在花瓶里插上鲜花，贝丝也没有打扫，艾美的书扔得到处都是，房间里显得冷清凌乱。只有“妈咪角”还是跟往常一样，收拾得整齐舒爽。美格就坐在那里，悠闲地看书，不停地打着哈欠，憧憬着用自己挣的钱买几件什么样的漂亮夏装。乔和劳里在河面上玩了一上午，下午则爬到苹果树上读《茫茫世界》，一边读一边还伤心落泪。贝丝也开始了试验，她把布娃娃们居住的大壁橱都翻了出来，可干了一半就累了，于是她把这些娃娃们撇在一边，自顾自地去弹钢琴了，心里庆幸不用刷碗了。艾美把自己的凉亭整理了一番，穿上最漂亮的白色外衣，梳理了那头卷曲的秀发，然后坐在金银花下面画画。她一心盼望着有人会看到，打听这位年轻的画家是谁。谁知道，根本没人过来，倒有一只好事的大蜘蛛饶有兴趣地端详她的作品。她只好出去散步，却淋了一场雨，回到家时成了落汤鸡。

茶点的时候，她们互相交流各自的感受。大家都有同感，这一天过得很开心，只是显得异常漫长。下午，美格去购物，买了块漂亮的蓝色平纹纱，裁下幅面后才发现，这料子不经洗，这次不幸弄得她略有点没好气。乔在划船时鼻子上晒破了一层皮，书读久了又弄得头痛脑涨。由于壁橱弄得乱七八糟，贝丝心里颇有几分担心，而且发现一次要学三四首歌也很不容易。艾美淋湿了外衣，深感可惜，因为第二天就是凯蒂·布朗的舞会，现在她像花神麦克弗林赛[3]一样衣不掩体。可这些都只是小事，她们要母亲放心，试验进展得很顺利。母亲笑了笑，什么都没说，在汉娜的帮助下，把她们丢下的工作做完，把家收拾得舒服安逸，于是家庭机器又正常运作。可说来也怪，这种休息加享乐的过程，竟然引发了一种奇特的、不舒服的状态。日子变得越来越漫长，大家的脾气也跟天气一样变化无常，每人都心里没着落，而魔鬼撒旦总能为这些无聊的人找些恶作剧来做。作为最奢侈的享受，美格把一些针线活拿去让别人做，可接着却发现日子过得很沉闷，最终又操起裁剪活来，结果在按莫法特的样式翻新衣服时，把自己的衣服剪坏了。乔整天看书，直看得两眼昏花，对书厌倦，心情也变得异常烦躁，连一向性情温和的劳里都跟她吵了一架。她情绪十分低落，只恨自己当初没有跟马奇姑婆一起去。贝丝过得挺好，因为她老是忘记这几天光玩不用工作，时不时地回到老套套。不过，有一种莫名的东西还是潜移默化，不时地扰乱她的那份宁静。她也显得有几分不安，甚至有一次，她竟然推搡了几下可怜的布娃娃乔安娜，骂她是个“丑八怪”。艾美的境况最糟糕，因为她玩的资源不多，姐姐们丢下她，让她自己玩，自己照顾自己。本来她还以为自己是个多才多艺、举足轻重的小人物，可现在很快就发现，其实自己却是个沉重的负担。她不喜欢布娃娃，童话又太幼稚，人总不能老是画画。茶会算不了什么，野餐也不过如此，除非组织得很好。“要么能有间漂亮的房子，里面有很多美丽的女孩，要么去旅行，这样的夏天才会开心。可在家里和三个自私自利的姐姐守在一起，还要再加上个大男孩，波阿斯也会受不了的。”这位乱用《圣经》典故[4]的小姐抱怨道。这几天她沉浸于充满快乐、烦恼和烦闷的生活。

没人愿意承认自己对试验已感到厌倦，可到了礼拜五晚上，人人都暗自高兴，一个礼拜马上就要熬到头了。富有幽默感的马奇太太希望加深姑娘们对这个教训的印象，决定以适当的方式结束这次试验。于是，她给汉娜放了一天假，以让姑娘们充分领略光玩乐的后果。

礼拜六早上，她们起床就发现，厨房里没有生火，餐厅里没做好早餐，连母亲的踪影都瞧不见。

“天哪！出什么事了？”乔大叫，沮丧地四下张望。

美格跑上楼，很快又回来了，显得一脸轻松，不过十分困惑，又有点惭愧。

“妈妈没生病，只是觉得很累，她想静静地在房里待一天，让我们好自为之。真的有点怪，妈妈以前可不是这样的。她说了，这个礼拜她过得很累，所以我们不要抱怨，还是自己照顾自己吧。”

“那太简单了，我就喜欢这样。我正想找点事干——就是换个玩法，是吧？”乔马上就接茬儿。

其实，她们眼下是要找点事做，要好好调剂一下。因此都起劲承担起来，可不久她们就认识到汉娜说得没错：“做家务可不是闹着玩的。”贮藏柜里有许多食品，贝丝和艾美摆桌子，美格和乔做早餐，一边做一边还纳闷，为什么用人们都说家务难做。

“我还是给妈妈拿点上去，尽管她吩咐我们不用管她，说她会照顾自己的。”美格说。她站在厨具后面指挥，俨然一副主妇的样子。

趁大家还没开吃，她们先装满一个盘子，然后连同厨师的问候一起送上楼去。虽然茶煮得又苦又涩，煎蛋烧焦了，饼干也沾上了点点苏打粉，不过马奇太太还是接过她的那份早餐，并连声道谢。等乔走了以后，她对着餐盘会心地笑了。

“可怜的小家伙们，恐怕今天会过得很难受哟。不过，她们不会遭罪，这毕竟对她们有好处。”说着，她拿出自己早已准备的美味，把难吃的早餐扔掉，免得她们伤心——这是母亲的小小把戏，令她们感激万分。

楼下怨声载道，大厨师面对失败深感委屈。“没关系，午饭我来做。我当仆人，你当主人，动口不动手，尽管陪客人，发号施令就是了。”乔说，其实她对做饭烧菜的事比美格懂得还少。

玛格丽特愉快地接受了这份热心帮助，于是退到了客厅。她把垃圾扫到沙发下面，把百叶窗拉上，省去了掸尘的麻烦，很快便把客厅整理好了。乔对她的办事能耐十分自信，还想弥合吵架造成的裂痕，她马上写了一张纸条，放入家庭邮局，邀请劳里过府来吃午饭。

“最好先弄清楚拿什么请客，再考虑请人家吃饭。”美格得知此事后说。这一举动虽然好客，可不免有点仓促。

“哦，有腌牛肉，还有很多土豆。我再去买些芦笋，买只龙虾。‘换个口味’，汉娜就是这么说的。我们可以买些生菜做色拉，虽然我不知道怎么做，可书上有烹饪指南的。我要用牛奶冻和草莓做甜点，要是你想高雅一点的话，还可以煮上咖啡。”

“不要做这么多，乔，你做的只有姜饼和糖蜜还凑合着能吃。这个餐会我是不会插手的，既然你自己请了劳里，就由你来招待他好了。”

“什么都不要你做，只要你对他客气些，做布丁时帮一把就够了。万一我搞糊涂了，麻烦指点一下，行吗？”乔嘴上说着，心里可受到了伤害。

“行，可我也懂得不多，只有面包和一些小吃还行。最好先请妈妈批准，再去买东西。”美格谨慎地回答。

“那当然啰，我又不是傻瓜。”乔说着走开了。她怒火中烧，竟然有人怀疑她的能耐。

“你们想做什么就买什么，不用来打扰我，午饭我出去吃，家里的事就管不到了。”乔来征求意见时，马奇太太说，“向来都不爱做家务，今天我放假，读读书、写点东西、串串门，落得自己娱乐娱乐。”

看到一向忙碌的母亲一反常态，一早就悠闲地坐在摇椅上看书，乔感到好像发生了什么异常的自然现象，即使日食、地震，甚至火山爆发，也不会令她觉得更奇怪。

“怎么回事，一切都乱套了。”她边想边走下楼梯，“贝丝正在那里哭，这证明家里肯定出现了什么麻烦。要是艾美在捣鬼，我一定要揍她几下。”

乔感觉自己不自在，匆匆走进客厅，看到贝丝正对着金丝雀皮普哭泣。只见它躺在笼子里死了，小爪子可怜地往外伸出，仿佛在乞求食物。它是饿死的。

“都是我的错——我把它给忘了——谷子一粒不剩，水也一滴没有。皮普噢！噢，皮普！我怎么能对你这么狠？”贝丝哭道，把可怜的小鸟放在手里，试图把它救醒。

乔瞄瞄小鸟半开的眼睛，摸摸它的心脏，发现它早已僵硬冰冷，于是提出用自己的多米诺骨牌盒来装殓。

“放在炉里烘，或者会暖和苏醒过来的。”艾美满怀希望地说。

“它是饿坏的。既然已经死了，就不要再去烤。我要给它做一件寿衣，葬在园子里。以后再不养鸟了，再不了，皮普！我不配养的。”贝丝低声哭诉着，双手捧着宠鸟坐在地板上。

“葬礼今天下午举行，我们都参加。好了，别哭了，贝丝。这事很可惜，但这礼拜事情全都乱了套，皮普便是这个试验的最大受害者。给它做好寿衣，放在我的盒子里。宴会后，我们举行一个隆重的小葬礼。”乔开始感到，自己仿佛承揽了大量的工作。

乔留下别人安慰贝丝，自己来到厨房。里面一片狼藉，令人一看就灰心丧气。穿上一件宽大的围裙，她开始工作了。她把碗碟摞起来，刚准备洗就发现火灭了。

“真是前途光明！”乔咕哝着，砰地一下打开炉门，用力地捅煤渣。

炉火捅旺了以后，她想趁着正在烧水这会儿去一趟菜场。一走路，精神又振奋起来，她买了一些便宜货，返家途中心里得意，有一只幼小的龙虾、一些老芦笋，还有两盒酸草莓。等到她收拾停当，午饭时间到了，炉子也烧红了。汉娜留下了一盘等着发酵的面包。美格老早就着手发面包，放在炉子上再发一遍，然后就忘了。现在，美格在客厅里招待萨莉·加德纳，突然门飞开了，进来一个人，浑身沾满面粉和煤屑，头发蓬乱，红着脸尖叫道：

“我说，面包胀到盘子外面是不是发酵够了？”

萨莉大笑起来，美格则点点头，眉头扬得老高，那个鬼影子见状立刻就消失了，马上去把发酸的面包放入烤炉。贝丝正坐在一旁缝寿衣，心爱的小鸟静静地躺在骨牌盒里。马奇太太四处打量了一番，对贝丝安慰了几句，然后就出门了。随着母亲灰色的帽子在拐弯处消失，姑娘们心中顿生一种孤立无援的异样感觉。没过几分钟，克罗克小姐出现了，说是来吃午饭的，她们彻底绝望了。这位小姐是位面黄肌瘦的老姑娘，长着尖尖的鼻梁和一双好奇的眼睛。她不会放过任何琐事，看到什么都会说长道短一番。姑娘们都不喜欢她，可母亲关照过要善待她，就是因为克罗克小姐又老又穷，也没几个朋友。美格为她搬来安乐椅，勉力招呼她，而克罗克小姐则问这问那，指手画脚，还闲扯她的那些熟人的事情。

那天早上，乔弄得精疲力竭、焦头烂额，真是难以言表。不仅如此，她做的午餐还成了一个十足的笑柄。由于不敢再向人讨教，她只能孤军奋战，这才发现，要当厨师，光凭力气和愿望是不够的。她把芦笋煮了一个小时，却伤心地发现芦笋头煮没了，中间那段却硬得要命。面包烤得焦黑，由于做色拉调料做得她大为恼火，她索性就撒手不管，直到最后，她终于相信自己烤的面包没法吃。龙虾不知怎的变成了猩红色的谜团，她敲开虾壳，然后剥开，一点点虾肉掉到一堆生菜叶子中间，消失得无影无踪。芦笋不能搁得太久，所以土豆要快点煮，结果煮得半生不熟。牛奶冻结块了，草莓是被店家巧妙地摞好的，其实没有看上去那么熟。

“好吧，要是肚子饿的话，可以吃牛肉，有面包夹黄油。只是整整一个上午的工夫花下去，毫无结果，真是丢脸。”乔心里想，她比平时迟了半个小时才打响了开饭的铃。她又热又累，垂头丧气地站在一旁，审视这顿为劳里和克罗克小姐准备的美餐。要知道，一个是吃惯了各种美味佳肴的；而另一个专爱挑人毛病的克罗克小姐，她会记下一切失误，能把这一切广为传播。

菜肴一一尝过后，就被冷落了，可怜的乔真想钻到桌子底下去。这时，艾美咯咯直笑，美格满脸愁容，克罗克小姐撅起嘴，劳里拼命地又说又笑，想搞活宴会的气氛。乔的拿手本领是水果，糖加得恰到好处，再拌上一罐浓味的奶油。当漂亮的玻璃盘一一摆上时，大家彬彬有礼地看着漂在奶油大海上的玫瑰红小岛，她发热的脸颊才稍微冷却了一点，并深深地舒了口气。克罗克小姐第一个品尝，只见她面容歪曲，慌忙喝水。乔看到水果在挑剔的叉子捣鼓下可悲地缩小，心想可能不够，于是她起先还不敢吃。她瞥了一眼劳里，见他正在勇敢地吃着，不过嘴微微皱起，眼睛盯着自己的盘子。艾美向来喜欢精制的食品，舀了满满一匙，噎住了，用餐巾捂着脸，猛地逃离了餐桌。

“噢，怎么啦？”乔高声问道，声音有点颤抖。

“放糖变成了放盐，奶油是酸的。”美格回答，一边还打了个灾难性的手势。

乔痛苦地叫了一声，一下就瘫倒在椅子上，这才记起厨桌上有两个盒子，自己拿起一个就仓促地往草莓上倒，而牛奶又忘了冷藏。她的脸色霎时变得通红，几乎要哭出来。这时，她与劳里的目光相遇了，他在勇敢地大嚼盐渍草莓，眼睛里还装出开心的样子。她突然觉得，这件事是多么的滑稽，于是大笑起来，直笑得眼泪都淌下来。其他人也都笑得前仰后合，连被姑娘们称作“牢骚鬼”的老姑娘也不例外。大家黄油加面包、吃着橄榄，有说有笑，这顿不幸的午餐开心地结束了。

“我现在没有心思收拾，先举行小鸟葬礼吧，让自己冷静下来。”乔看到大家站起来便说道。克罗克小姐一心赶着要在下一个朋友的餐桌边编派这个新故事，便向大家告辞。

为了贝丝，他们全都静默下来了。劳里在树林的蕨草下面挖了个墓穴，小皮普被安放在里头，它那柔情万丈的女主人哭得成了个泪人儿。墓穴盖上苔藓，上立一块石碑，碑上挂一个用紫罗兰和繁缕编成的花环，并刻了墓志铭。铭文是乔一面做饭一面想出来的：





墓主皮普·马奇，

卒于六月七日；

一身宠爱，故主伤心，

小鸟小鸟，永垂不朽！





小鸟的葬礼结束后，贝丝回到房间，心情十分沉重，还在想着龙虾。但她却找不到休息的地方，几张床都没有整理。她把枕头拍松，又把东西收拾了一番，悲伤的心才觉得舒坦些。美格帮助乔收拾残羹剩饭，花了半个下午才干完。她们已经劳累不堪，决定晚餐就喝清茶，再吃点烤面包就打发了。劳里带着艾美去乘马车，他确实干了件善事，因为艾美吃了酸奶油心情不好。下午，马奇太太回家时，看到三个姐姐都在努力干活。她看了一眼壁橱，心里就明白，试验已经部分成功了。

这些家庭主妇还没来得及休息，又有几个人来拜访。一阵混乱，才准备好招待他们，接着沏茶，做各种跑腿的琐事。一两件非做不可的针线活已经不能再拖了。夜幕降临，一切都沉寂下来，外面起露水了，姑娘们一个个都聚集在走廊上，六月的玫瑰露出了美丽的花蕾。大家都坐下来，不是呻吟就是叹息，仿佛都筋疲力尽、心事重重。

“这一天真可怕！”乔照例还是第一个开口。

“好像比平时短一点，可很难熬。”美格说。

“一点都没个家的样子。”艾美接着说。

“没有妈咪和小皮普，不可能像家。”贝丝叹息道，满怀深情地瞥了一眼头上空荡荡的鸟笼。

“妈妈来了，乖乖，如果你想要的话，明天可以再养一只。”

马奇太太说着来到她们中间。看得出来，她的假日似乎也愉快不了多少。

“女儿们，对试验满意吗？还想再这样过一个礼拜吗？”她问。这时贝丝凑到母亲跟前，其他姐妹也围了过来，脸上发亮，就像朵朵鲜花转向了太阳。

“我不想。”乔坚定地高声嚷道。

“我也不想。”其他人都附和道。

“那么，你们认为，承担一些责任，活着为别人考虑一点，这样更好些，是不是？”

“闲逛玩乐可没什么好处。”乔说着点点头，“我已经厌烦了，想马上找点事情做。”

“假如学会烧家常菜，这本领可有用啦，主妇少了它可不行。”马奇太太说。这时，她想起了乔一手操办的午餐会，暗暗地发笑。她已经碰到过克罗克小姐，听她说了有关的情况。

“妈妈，你出去了，什么事都不管，就为了看看我们会怎么样，是不是啊？”美格大声问道。她心存疑窦已经有一整天了。

“对，我想让你们看到，只有每个人都做好本分工作，大家才能过得舒服。平时是我和汉娜替你们做，你们的日子才过得蛮舒坦。不过我总觉得，你们不会开心，也不会领情。所以我想给你们一个小小的教训，让你们知道，如果每个人都只顾着自己，事情会怎样结局。只有互相帮衬，做好日常工作，才能享受休闲的快乐；只有大家容忍克制，我们才会觉得家里舒服、可爱。你们说是不是这样？”

“是的，妈妈，我们就是这么想的！”姑娘们齐声喊道。

“那么我就建议你们，再一次挑起自己的小负担。虽然有时担子显得很沉重，但对我们有好处，学会了挑法，担子也就轻松了。工作是好东西，人人都有份儿，有益身心健康，免得我们无聊，干坏事。比起金钱和时装，工作更能给我们一种能力感和独立感。”

“我们会像工蜂一样工作，并且热爱工作，看着吧！”乔说，“我要把做饭当作我的假日任务来学，下一次宴会一定会成功。”

“我要帮爸爸做一件衬衣，不用您操劳，妈咪。我能做到的，也愿意这样做，虽然我并不喜欢针线活；这样做比成天讲究自己的衣着更有好处，事实上我的衣着也已经很不错了。”美格说。

“我要每天做功课，不再花这么多时间弹琴和玩洋娃娃。我天性愚笨，应该多用功，而不是玩。”贝丝下定了决心。艾美则学姐姐们的样子大声宣布：“我要学会缝纽扣和区分各种词类。”

“很好！这样的话，我对这个试验十分满意，看来我们也不用再试了。不过，不要走另一个极端，像奴隶那样过度劳累。要劳逸结合，让每一天都过得既开心又有收获，证明自己懂得时间的宝贵，能充分利用它。那样的话，年轻时就会快乐无比，老来也不会有太多的遗憾，哪怕贫穷，生活也会变得丰富多彩，充满成功。”

“我们一定记住，妈妈！”她们确实也记住了。

第十二章　劳伦斯营地


贝丝是邮局局长，她在家时间最多，能够按时收取邮件。再说，她也非常喜欢每天打开邮箱小门，分发邮件的工作。七月的一天，她双手捧满邮件进来了，然后满屋子分发书信和包裹，俨然一副便士邮递员[1]的样子。

“这是您的花束，妈妈！劳里总是把这事记在心上。”她边说边把香喷喷的鲜花插进摆在“妈咪角”的花瓶里，花瓶一直是那位感情细腻的男孩负责填满的。

“美格·马奇小姐，一封信和一只手套。”贝丝继续工作，把邮件递给坐在妈妈身边缝袖口的姐姐。

“咦，我在那边丢了一双，怎么现在只有一只？”美格望望灰色的棉手套，“你是不是把另一只丢在园子里头了？”

“没有，肯定没有，邮箱里就只有一只。”

“我讨厌落单手套！不过不要紧，另一只会找到的。我的信只是我要的一首德语歌的译文。我想是布鲁克写的，不是劳里的字迹嘛。”

马奇太太瞅一眼美格，只见她穿着一袭方格花布晨衣，额前的小鬈发随风轻轻飘动，显得美丽动人，女性味十足。她坐在堆满白布卷的小工作台边，哼着歌儿飞针走线，脑子里只顾做着如皮带上的三色堇一样朝气蓬勃、天真无邪的少女美梦，一点也没有觉察到妈妈的心事。马奇太太笑了，感到十分满意。

“乔博士有两封信、一本书，还有一顶滑稽的旧帽子，把整个邮箱都盖住了，还露出一部分在外面呢。”贝丝边说边笑着走进书房，乔正坐着写作呢。

“劳里真是个狡猾的家伙啊！我说如果流行大帽子就好了，因为我每到天热就会把脸晒伤。他说：‘何必管它流行不流行？就戴一顶大帽，舒服要紧！’我说如果我有就会戴的，他就送了这顶来试我。我偏要戴上它，跟他闹着玩，让他知道我不在乎流行不流行的。”乔把这顶旧式阔边帽子挂到柏拉图的半身像上，开始读信。

一封是妈妈写的，她读着便双颊飞红，热泪盈眶了，信上说：





乖乖：

写条子是要告诉你，看到你为控制脾气不遗余力，我甚感欣慰。你不辞劳苦，不计成败，也许以为除了那位每天给你帮助的“朋友”（我相信是那本封面卷了角的指导书）外无人知晓。不过，我也一一看在眼里，而且完全相信你的诚意和决心，因为你的决心已经开始开花结果了。继续努力吧，乖乖，耐着性子，鼓足勇气，记住有一个人比任何人都更关心你，更爱护你，她就是我。

你亲爱的妈妈





“此话对我很有好处，这封信抵得成千上万的金钱和无数溢美之词。啊，妈咪，我确实是在努力！在您的帮助下，我一定不屈不挠地坚持下去。”

乔把头靠在臂上，笔下的小说稿纸上洒下了几滴喜泪。她原以为没有人看到和欣赏她为了学好而做的努力，现在变了。她一向最敬重母亲的话，母亲的赞扬出人意表，显得弥足珍贵，更加鼓舞人心。她把纸条当作护身符别在上衣里面，以便时刻提醒自己，更增加了迎战、征服那恶魔的信心。她接着打开另一封信，准备接受这个不知是好是坏的消息，展现在眼前的是劳里大大咧咧的字：





亲爱的乔：

明天有几个英国小孩来看我，准备玩个痛快。如果天气晴朗，将去长草坪搭帐篷，大家一起划船去，吃午饭，玩棒球——生篝火，烧东西吃，学吉普赛人，享受各种乐趣。他们人都很友善，都喜欢这样玩。布鲁克也去，他照看我们这帮男孩子，凯特·沃恩管束女孩子。希望你们都能来，无论如何别丢下贝丝，没人难为她。至于吃的，请不要担心——一切都由我来安排。只要人来就行，这才够朋友！

匆匆搁笔。

你永远的朋友

劳里





“好彩头！”乔喊着飞奔进屋，去告诉美格，“当然可以去的，妈妈，是吧？还可以帮帮劳里，我能划船，美格会做饭，妹妹们也多少能帮上点忙。”

“希望沃恩姐弟不是讲究体面的成年人。你了解他们吗，乔？”美格问。

“只知道他们是四姐弟。凯特年纪比你大，弗雷德和弗兰克双胞胎，年纪跟我差不多，还有个小姑娘（格莱丝），大概有十岁。劳里是在国外认识他们的，他喜欢那两个男孩子。我想，他不怎么喜欢凯特，因为他谈起她便严肃地抿起嘴巴。”

“我真高兴，我的法式印花布服装还干干净净，这种场合穿正合适，又好看！”美格得意地说，“你有合适的衣服吗，乔？”

“红灰两色的划艇衣，够好的了。我要划船，到处跑动，不想顾忌衣服上过浆而不敢动弹。你也来吧，贝丝？”

“那你得别让那些男孩子跟我说话。”

“一个也不让！”

“我想让劳里高兴，我也不怕布鲁克先生，他是个大好人，但是我不想玩，不想唱，也不想说话。我会埋头干活，不麻烦别人。你来照看我，乔，那我就去。”

“这才是我的好妹妹。你努力克服自己的害羞心理，我真高兴。我知道改正缺点并不容易，而一句鼓励的话儿，就能使人精神一振。谢谢您，妈妈。”乔说着感激地吻了一下母亲瘦削的脸庞，这一吻对于马奇太太来说，比让她恢复丰满红润的青春笑脸都要宝贵。

“我收到一盒巧克力糖和我想要临摹的图画。”艾美说着把邮件打开给大家看。

“我收到劳伦斯先生一张字条，叫我今晚点灯前过去弹琴给他听，我会去的。”贝丝接着说，她跟老人的友谊与日俱增。

“我们马上行动起来吧，今天干双倍活，明天就可以玩得无忧无虑了。”乔说道，准备放下笔杆，拿起扫帚。

第二天清早，太阳公公把头探进姑娘们的房间，告诉她们是个大晴天。这时，他看到了滑稽的一幕。姑娘们个个都为这次野营做好了必要的准备。美格脑门上挂着一排卷发纸；乔在晒焦的脸上涂了冷面霜；贝丝把乔安娜带上床共眠，来补偿即将到来的分离；最可笑的要算艾美，她用衣夹夹住鼻子，想以此来使那个令人烦恼的鼻子挺一点。这种夹子原来是画家拿来把纸夹到画板上的，现在用于这项用途也算物尽其用吧。这可笑的一幕似乎把太阳都给逗乐了。他乐得金光四射，把乔晒醒了，她冲着艾美的这副打扮哈哈大笑，吵醒了众姐妹。

阳光和欢笑都是开心聚会的好兆头，很快，两家的屋子里都开始忙碌起来。贝丝第一个准备好，她靠在窗前不断报告邻居的动态，活跃了三姐妹梳妆打扮的气氛。

“一个人带着帐篷出来了！我看到巴克太太把午饭放到一个食盒和大篓里。现在劳伦斯先生抬头看天空和风标，但愿他也一起去。那是劳里，打扮得像个水手——好小伙子啊！啊呀呀！马车上全是人，一个高个女士、一个小姑娘，还有两个可怕的男孩子。一个是瘸子，可怜巴巴的！他拄着拐杖。劳里没跟我们说过。快点，姑娘们！时间不早了。呀，我这里宣告，那是内德·莫法特。瞧，美格，这不是那天我们购物时向你欠身的那个人吗？”

“可不是嘛。奇怪，他怎么也来了？我还以为他在山里头呢。那是萨莉，太好了，她回来得正是时候。你看我这样行吗，乔？”美格惊慌地问道。

“标准的美人。提起裙子，把帽子扶正，这样斜翘着显得感伤，而且风一吹便飞走了。好了，我们出发吧！”

“乔，你不是要戴这顶糟帽子去吧？太荒唐了，你不该把自己弄得像个小伙子的。”美格规劝道。此时乔正把劳里开玩笑送来的旧式阔边意大利草帽用一根红丝带围系起来。

“我就要戴着去，它棒极了——又挡阴，又轻，又大。戴上它很滑稽，再说，只要舒服，我不在乎做个小伙子。”乔说罢迈步就走，姐妹们紧跟其后。每人穿一身夏装，戴一顶逍遥自在的宽边帽子，满脸笑容，十分好看，俨然一支活泼快乐的小队伍。

劳里跑过来迎接，然后十分热忱地把姑娘们一一介绍给他的朋友们。草坪就是接待室，在那里没待几分钟，气氛就变得相当活跃。美格发现，凯特小姐虽然二十岁了，可穿戴朴素，心里顿时松了口气，要知道，这可是美国女孩应该学习的。听到内德先生一再向她保证，自己是专为看她才过来的，她感到受宠若惊。乔知道为什么一提起凯特，劳里就抿住嘴巴，装出一本正经的样子。原来那位小姐有一种“走开，别碰我”的架子，这与其他姑娘自由轻松的举止形成了鲜明对比。贝丝仔细地观察了一番刚认识的这些男孩，最后断定脚跛的那位并不可怕，倒是温文尔雅，且体弱多病，应该对他友好。艾美发现格莱斯人虽小，可举止优雅、活泼开朗，互相默默地对视了几分钟后，马上就成了好朋友。

帐篷、午饭、棒球游戏器具早就先行送走，所以大家很快登上了小船。两叶轻舟一起推进，岸上只剩下挥着帽子的劳伦斯先生一人。劳里和乔共划一条船，布鲁克先生和内德先生划另一条，而淘气作乱的双胞胎之一弗雷德·沃恩则使劲划着一只单人赛艇，像受了惊的水生蝽一样在旁边横冲直撞，妄图将两船撞翻。乔那顶风趣的帽子用途十分广泛，值得鸣谢。它一开始便打破隔膜，逗得众人一笑，她划船时帽子上下摆动，扇出阵阵清风。她说，如果下起雨来，还可以给全班人马当作一把大伞使用。凯特觉得乔的一举一动都十分离奇，特别是她丢了桨时大叫“真该死”。而劳里就座时不小心在乔脚上绊了一下，他说：“我的好伙伴，弄痛了没有？”这更叫她纳罕不已。戴上眼镜把这位奇怪的姑娘审视几遍后，凯特小姐认定乔“古怪，但挺聪明”，于是远远对着她微笑起来。

另一条船上，美格舒舒服服地坐在两个桨手的对面。两个小伙子见状大喜，各自使出非凡的技巧和机敏，去做平掠回桨的动作。布鲁克先生是个严肃、沉默寡言的青年，声音悦耳动听，棕色的眼睛很神气。美格喜欢他性格沉静，把他看做是一部活百科全书，装着各种有用的知识。他不大跟她说话，但目光却常常落在她身上，美格肯定他对自己并不反感。内德是大学新生，当然认为摆足派头是自己应尽的义务。他并不特别聪明，但脾气随和，不失为维持野炊活动的好人选。萨莉·加德纳一面尽心竭力护着自己的凸纹布白裙子不弄脏，一面和无处不在的弗雷德攀谈，因为弗雷德不断胡闹，贝丝被吓得心惊胆战。

长草坪并不远，他们到的时候帐篷已经搭好，三门柱也竖了起来。这是块令人神清气爽的绿色旷野，当中有三棵枝繁叶茂的橡树，还有一条狭长而平整的草坪可打棒球。

“欢迎来到劳伦斯营地！”年轻的主人喊道。他们刚靠岸，欢呼雀跃着。

“布鲁克是总司令，我是军需部长，其他男士是参谋，各位女士都当客人。帐篷是特意为你们搭的，那棵橡树就是你们的起居室，这棵是食堂，另外一棵是营地伙房。现在，趁天还没热起来，我们先来打一局球，然后再做午饭。”

弗兰克、贝丝、艾美和格莱斯坐下来观看其他八个人打球。布鲁克先生挑了美格、凯特和弗雷德，劳里则选了萨莉、乔和内德。英国人玩得很出色，可是美国人更胜一筹，好像受到了1776年[2]精神的鼓舞，士气十足，寸土必争。乔和弗雷德之间发生几次争执，有一次还差点吵了起来。乔在打最后一道门时，一下击空了，这使她大为恼火。弗雷德紧随其后，却比乔早轮到击球。他击了一下，球打到了门柱上，在球门外一寸的地方停了下来。大家离得都很远，他跑上前来看个究竟，脚尖偷偷地把球轻轻一拨，球随之到了球门内一寸的地方。

“我进了！嗨，乔小姐，我要收拾你，先赢球。”年轻的绅士大声喊道，一边晃动着他的槌棒，准备再次击球。

“你把它踢进去的，我看到了。现在该轮到我了。”乔大声说。

“我敢发誓，没有踢。球刚才也许是滚了一下，可那没犯规。请你让开，我要冲击桩标了。”

“这里是美国，我们从不赖皮，不过你要赖就赖吧。”乔气愤地说。

“谁不知道，美国佬最狡猾了。看球！”弗雷德反驳道，并把她的球槌出老远。

乔刚要张口骂人，可她忍住了，脸涨得通红，站了片刻，使尽全身力气拿下了一轮。也就在这时，弗雷德击中了桩标，欣喜若狂地宣布自己胜出。乔走过去捡球，好一会儿才在灌木丛中找到了自己的球。她回来后显得很冷静，耐心地等着击球。过了几个回合，她终于收复失地，可等到这时，另一方几乎赢定了，因为凯特是倒数第二个击球，而球就在桩标边上。

“哎呀，我们完结了！再见，凯特，乔小姐还欠我一个球呢，你是完蛋了。”弗雷德兴奋地喊道，这时大家都走过来观看最后的决战。

“美国佬有对敌人宽宏大量的本事。”乔说着瞥了他一眼，使小伙子的脸霎时涨得通红。“特别是击败敌人的时候。”她补充说。乔绝妙一击，球绕过凯特的球进了球门，她获得了比赛的胜利。

劳里把帽子往上一抛，突然又想起输家是自己的客人，不便太高兴，于是刚欢呼了几声，就赶紧停下来。他对乔悄悄地说：“干得好，乔！他的确耍赖，我看到了。我们不能跟他直说，可他以后不会再这样了，相信我吧。”

美格把乔拉到一边，假装帮她夹紧一绺松下来的头发，夸奖她说：“这事真叫人来气，可你没有发作，我真高兴，乔。”

“别夸我，美格，到现在我都想给他个耳光。我躲在荨麻丛里，消了消气才没说出口，要不，我早就发作了。现在还很火，他最好滚得远一点。”乔说着咬紧嘴唇，大帽子下的双眼瞪着弗雷德。

“做饭了。”布鲁克先生看了看表说，“军需部长，你生火，再提些水来，好吗？马奇小姐、萨莉小姐，还有我，摊桌子。谁咖啡煮得好？”

“乔会的！”美格说，高兴地推荐妹妹。乔最近经常下厨烧菜，学了不少技艺，觉得这下可以露一手了。她走过去照看咖啡壶，妹妹们拾干柴，男孩们生火，到附近的泉眼提水。凯特小姐在写生，贝丝一边用灯芯草编小垫子做盘子，一边和弗兰克聊天。

总司令带领助手们很快就摊好了桌布。吃的喝的都摆上了，引得众人直流口水，其中又点缀了几片绿色的叶子，色香味俱佳。乔宣布咖啡煮好了，大家都坐下来享受一顿丰盛的午餐。年轻人一般肠胃都很好，运动后更是胃口大增。午饭吃得很开心，一切都显得那么新鲜、有趣，朗朗的笑声此起彼伏，竟把正在附近吃草的一匹老马都惊动了。餐桌不平，弄得杯子和盘子东倒西歪，频遭厄运。橡子掉到了牛奶里，黑色的小蚂蚁不请自来，也来分享点心，还有长满绒毛的毛虫也从树上吊下来瞧个究竟。三个白头发的小孩从篱笆上探出脑袋，河对岸的一条狗冲着他们拼命地叫个不停。

“要加的话，盐在这里。”劳里说着把一碟草莓递给乔。

“谢谢，我宁可要蜘蛛。”说着，乔从奶油中捞出两只小蜘蛛，那是不小心掉到里面淹死的。“怎么还敢提上次糟糕的宴会？就算你的宴会无懈可击，那又怎么样？”乔接着说。两人都会心地笑了，由于瓷盘不够，他们就合用一个盘子。

“那天我吃得特别开心，至今难忘啊。要知道，今天可不是我的功劳。我什么都没做，都是你、美格和布鲁克一手操办的，我是感激不尽啊。吃饱了干什么呢？”劳里问。他感到自己的王牌已经打完了，吃完午饭就没什么安排了。

“玩游戏，等天凉快些再回去。我带了‘猜作者’游戏卡，我敢说，凯特小姐一定会玩好多新花样。去问问她，她是客人，你应该多和她待在一起的。”

“你不也是客人嘛！我想布鲁克跟她合适，可他老是与美格聊天，凯特戴着那副滑稽的眼镜，盯着他们看。我要走了，用不着教我那些规矩，你自己做不到的。”

凯特确实会玩几种新花样，女孩们不愿再吃了，男孩们也吃不下了，他们都退到了起居室，玩起“废话接龙”的游戏。

“一个人开始讲故事，说什么废话都行，可长可短，只是要注意，说到紧要关头必须打住，让另一个人接龙。做得好是很有趣的，可以形成一大堆可悲可喜的材料，使人大笑特笑。请开头吧，布鲁克先生。”凯特以命令的口气说。美格对这位家教是以礼相待的，听了很吃惊。

布鲁克先生躺在草地上，位于两位小姐的脚边。他漂亮的棕色眼睛盯着波光粼粼的河面，顺从地起头了：

“从前有个骑士，穷得只剩下剑和盾，于是出去闯世界打天下。他历尽艰辛，周游列国，差不多有二十八年之久，最后来到老国王的宫殿。老国王有一匹心爱的小宝马，但尚未驯服。他下令，谁把马训练好，就有重赏。骑士同意试一试，决定稳扎稳打。宝马雄壮骁勇，很快就和新主人建立了感情，虽然性子暴烈，但还是日渐驯服了。每天训练时，骑士都骑着国王的宝马穿越这座城市，边走边寻找梦中出现过无数次的漂亮脸蛋，但一直找不到。一天，他策马走过一条寂静的街道，却在废城堡的窗口里看到了那可爱的脸。他惊喜万分，便打听是谁住在这座旧城堡里头，得知原来是几位掳来的公主，中了魔咒，被关在里头，整天纺纱织布，存钱赎自由。骑士极想解救她们，但身无分文，于是只能天天路过那里，盼望着再次看到佳人的脸蛋，希望公主能来到光天化日之下。最后他决定闯进城堡，设法帮助她们。他走过去敲门，大门马上拉开，他看到了——”

“一位绝色佳人，她狂喜地大叫一声，高呼：‘终于盼来啦！盼来啦！'”凯特接上茬，她读过法国小说，喜欢那种风格，“‘原来是她呀！’居斯塔夫伯爵喊道，欣喜若狂地拜倒在她的石榴裙下。‘起来啊！’她伸出纤纤玉手说道。‘不起来！除非你告诉我怎么才能救你。’骑士跪在那里发誓。‘呵，厄运把我囚在这里，暴君不死，我就没有出头之日。'‘坏蛋在哪里？'‘在紫红色的大厅里。去吧，勇敢的爱人，快把我救出绝境。'‘遵命，一定与他决一死战！’说完这几句豪言壮语后，他冲出去，推开紫红色大厅的大门，正要走进去，却遭到——”

“希腊大词典的一下痛击，一个披黑衣的老家伙对他下了手，”内德说，“某某爵士马上回过神来，把暴君摔出窗外，大获全胜，转身去与佳人相会，但眉头上顶着大包，却发现门锁上了，只好撕破窗帘做成绳梯，下到半途绳梯突然断裂，他一头栽进六十英尺下面的护城河。他谙熟水性，涉水绕城堡而行，最后来到一扇有两名彪形大汉把守的小门。他把两个脑袋撞在一起，脑袋被挤得像核桃一样裂开，接着，不费吹灰之力便破门而入，走上两级石阶，上面积满了一英尺厚的灰尘，还有拳头大小的癞蛤蟆，大蜘蛛准把你吓得歇斯底里尖叫，马奇小姐。在石阶上头，他蓦地撞到了一个景象，令他大惊失色，毛骨悚然，他看到——”

“一个高高的身影，一身白衣服，脸上蒙了一块面纱，瘦骨嶙峋的手提着一盏灯。”美格续上去，“那个影子招招手，无声无息地沿着像坟墓一样黑暗冰凉的走廊滑行。披着盔甲的塑像阴森森地站立两边，周围一片死寂，灯火发出幽蓝的光，鬼影不时向他转过脸来，两只恐怖的眼睛透过白面纱发出闪闪幽光。他们走到一扇挂了帘子的门前，门后面奏起悦耳的音乐，他跳上前要走进去，幽灵把他拽了回来，威胁地在他面前扬着一个——”

“鼻烟盒。”乔阴森森地说，众人听得毛发倒竖，“‘谢了。’骑士礼貌地说，一面拈了一撮儿，随即重重地打了七个大喷嚏，震得脑袋都掉了下来。‘哈！哈！’鬼魂狂笑着。恶鬼透过钥匙孔，看到公主们仍在纺线赎身，便捡起牺牲品，把他放进一个大铁皮箱子里，箱子里头还密密麻麻地塞了十一个无头骑士，他们全站起身来，开始——”

“跳号笛舞。”弗雷德趁乔停下换气时插进来，“他们跳舞时，废城堡变成了一艘鼓满风帆的战船。‘三角帆向风，收中桅帆升降索，背风转舵，炮手就位！’船长吼叫道。此时一艘葡萄牙海盗船正驶入视线，前桅飘着一面黑旗。‘为了胜利，弟兄们冲啊！’船长说，于是大战开始了。当然是英方打赢了，他们向来都是赢家。”

“不对！”乔在一旁叫道。

“把海盗船长俘虏后，战船直冲那纵帆船，船甲板上堆满尸体，鲜血从下风一侧排水孔流了出来，因为下的命令是‘拔刀，拼死肉搏！'。‘副水手长，拿三角帆帆脚索扣来，如果这坏蛋不赶快招供，就把他干掉。’英国舰船长说道。那葡萄牙人咬紧牙关，坚决不招，情愿走跳板跳海。快乐的水手们欢呼若狂。但那狡猾的家伙潜入水中，游到战船下面凿穿船底，眼看扬满风帆的船儿沉了下去，往海底，海底，海底，那儿——”

“啊，天啊！我该说什么？”萨莉叫道。此时弗雷德收住了他的连篇废话，水手用语和生活描写的大杂烩，全都取材于他最喜欢的一本书。“唔，他们沉到海底，美人鱼前来迎接，看到装着无头骑士的箱子，美人鱼十分伤心，便好心地把他们腌在盐水里，希望能发现他们的秘密，是女人，好奇心就强。后来，有人潜水下来，美人鱼便说，‘若能把箱子拿上去，便把这盒珍珠送给你。’她想让这些可怜虫起死回生，但自己却无力抬起沉重的箱子。潜水者把箱子举上来，打开一看，并无珍珠，失望之余，便把箱子遗弃在一片荒野里，被一个——”

“小牧鹅女发现了。小姑娘在这片地里养了百头肥鹅。”艾美在萨莉才思枯竭时接着，“她很替骑士们难过，便请教一位老太太，怎样才能救他们。‘你的鹅会告诉你的，鹅无所不知。’老太太说。她接着又问，旧脑袋丢了，应该用什么做新脑袋，只见那些鹅百嘴张开，齐齐尖叫——”

“‘卷心菜！'”劳里立即接上去，“‘就是它了。’姑娘说道，随即跑到菜园里摘了十二棵大卷心菜。她把卷心菜装上，骑士们马上复活了。他们谢过牧鹅女，兴高采烈地上路，并不知道脑袋换了。世上跟他们一样的脑袋太多了，见怪不怪。我关注的那位骑士回头去找佳人，得知公主们已靠纺纱赎回了自由，除了一位外已全部出嫁了。骑士听了热血沸腾，跨上一直跟他赴汤蹈火的小公马，冲进城堡，看看到底留下了哪位。他隔着树篱偷窥，看到他心爱的公主正在花园里采花。‘给我一朵玫瑰好吗？’他问道。‘自己过来拿。我不能走来找你，这样不规矩。’佳人柔声说道。他试图爬过树篱，但它似乎越长越高；然后他想冲破树篱，但它却越长越密。他一筹莫展，于是耐心地把枝杈一枝一枝折断，开了一个小洞，从洞里望进去，哀求道：‘让我进吧！让我进吧！’但俏公主似乎并不理解，依然平静地采她的玫瑰，任由他孤身奋战。他有没有冲进去呢？弗兰克会告诉大家的。”

“我不会，我没有参加游戏，我从来都不玩的。”弗兰克说道。他不知道怎样做，才能把这对荒唐的情人从感情困境中解救出来。贝丝早躲到乔的身后，格莱丝则睡着了。

“那么说可怜的骑士就被困在树篱上了，对吗？”布鲁克先生眼睛仍然凝视着小河，手里把玩着插在纽孔上的蔷薇，问道。

“我想后来公主给了他一束玫瑰，并把门打开。”劳里说，顾自笑着，向老师扔橡树子。

“看我们凑了篇什么样的废话！多练练，或许就能搞出点聪明的名堂吧？你们知道‘真心话’吗？”当大家笑过自己瞎编的故事后，萨莉问。

“但愿我知道。”美格认真地说。

“我是指那个游戏。”

“什么游戏？”弗雷德问。

“哦，这样，大家把手叠起来，选一个数字，然后轮流抽出手，抽到这个数字的人，得老实回答大家的问题。很好玩的。”

“我们试试吧。”喜欢新花头的乔说。

凯特小姐、布鲁克先生、美格和内德退出了。弗雷德、萨莉、乔和劳里叠手玩游戏，劳里抽中了。

“谁是你心目中的英雄？”乔问。

“爷爷和拿破仑。”

“你认为这里哪位女士最漂亮？”萨莉问。

“玛格丽特。”

“最喜欢哪一位？”弗雷德问。

“乔，那还用说。”

劳里说得实事求是，大家全笑起来。乔轻蔑地耸耸肩，说：“你们问得真无聊！”

“再玩一回，‘真心话’这游戏挺不错的。”弗雷德说。

“对你来说是好游戏。”乔低声反驳道。

这回轮到她了。

“最大的缺点是什么？”弗雷德问，借此试探她是否诚实。他自己缺乏这种美德。

“脾气急躁。”

“最希望得到什么？”劳里问。

“一双靴带。”乔揣测到他的用意，给予迎头痛击。

“回答不老实，必须说出真正最希望得到什么。”

“天才，难道你不是恨不得你可以送给我吗，劳里？”她望着那张失望的脸孔狡黠地一笑。

“最敬慕男士什么美德？”萨莉问。

“勇敢真诚。”

“现在该我了。”弗雷德说道，他抽中最后。

“给他来点厉害的。”劳里向乔耳语，乔点点头，立即问：

“棒球比赛你难道没有赖皮？”

“嗯，唔，有那么一点点。”

“好！你的故事难道不是取自《海狮》? ”劳里问。

“差不多。”

“你难道不认为英国在各方面都完美？”萨莉问。

“不这样，我就枉为英国人了。”

“真是彻头彻尾的约翰牛[3]。好了，萨莉小姐，轮到你了，不必等抽签。我要问你一个问题，先折磨一下你的感情。你觉得自己是不是有几分卖弄风情？”劳里说。乔则向弗雷德点点头，表示讲和了。

“好个鲁莽汉！当然不是的。”萨莉叫道，那架势说明事实恰恰相反。

“最恨什么？”弗雷德问。

“蜘蛛和米粥汤。”

“最喜欢什么？”乔问。

“跳舞和法国手套。”

“哦，我看‘真心话’是无聊透顶的把戏，不如换个有意思的，我们玩‘猜作者’来提神吧。”乔提议。

内德、弗兰克和小姑娘们加入了这个游戏，三个年长一点的则坐到一边聊天。凯特小姐又拿出她的写生本，美格看着她画，布鲁克先生则躺在草地上，手里拿着一本书，却又不看。

“你画得真棒！真希望我也会。”美格说道，声音又仰慕又遗憾。

“那你为什么不学？我认为你有这方面的趣味和才华。”凯特小姐礼貌地回答。

“没有时间啊。”

“可能你妈妈希望你学别的才艺吧。我妈妈也一样，但我私下学了几课，把才华证明给她看，她便同意我继续学了。你不也一样可以自己跟家庭教师学啊？”

“我没有家庭教师。”

“我倒忘了，美国姑娘大都上学堂，跟我们不一样。爸爸说，这些学校都很气派。我猜你上的是私立学校吧？”

“我根本不上学。我自己便是个家庭教师。”

“是吗？”凯特小姐说。但她倒不如直说：“哎哟，真糟糕！”因为她的语气分明有这个意思。她脸上的神情使美格涨红了脸，懊悔自己刚才太坦诚。

布鲁克先生抬起头，马上说道：“美国姑娘跟她们的祖先一样热爱独立，她们自食其力，并因此而受到敬重。”

“噢，不错，她们这样做当然十分体面。我们也有不少高尚可敬的小姐这样做，受雇于贵族阶层。因为，作为绅士家的女儿，她们都很有教养和才艺的呢。”凯特小姐用一种恩赐的腔调说道，这伤及了美格的自尊心，使她的工作变得不但更加讨厌，而且更加低人一等了。

“那首德语歌合你的口味吗，马奇小姐？”布鲁克先生打破尴尬的沉默，问道。

“当然！优美极了，我十分感激替我翻译的那个人。”美格板着的脸说话时又有了神采。

“你不会德语吗？”凯特小姐惊讶地问。

“读得不大好。父亲原来教我，但现在不在家，我自学进展不快，没人纠正发音嘛。”

“现在就读读看，这里有席勒的《玛丽·斯图亚特》，还有一位愿意教你的家庭老师。”布鲁克先生笑容可掬地把他的书放在她膝盖上。

“这本书太难，不敢读。”美格说道。她十分感激，但在多才多艺的小姐面前又感到很不好意思。

“我先读几句来鼓励你。”凯特小姐说着，把其中最优美的一段朗诵一遍，读得一字不差，但却毫无表情。

布鲁克先生听完后不语。凯特小姐把书交回美格，美格天真地说道：

“我想这是诗歌吧。”

“部分是。读读这段吧。”

布鲁克先生把书翻到“可怜玛丽的挽歌”一页，嘴角挂着一丝怪笑。

美格服从了，顺着新教师用来指点的长草叶羞涩地慢慢读下去。她的声调悦耳轻柔，那些生涩难读的字句不知不觉全变得如诗如歌。绿草叶一路指下去，把美格带到悲泣哀怨的神往境界。她旋即忘掉了听众，旁若无人地往下读，读到不幸的女王说话时，腔调带上了悲剧口气。当时，她要是看到了那对棕色眼睛，一定会突然停下的，但她没有抬头，这堂课于是没有砸锅。

“读得好！”布鲁克先生待她停下来说道。其实她读错了不少单词，但他当作没听到，俨然一副热爱教书的模样。

凯特小姐带上眼镜，把眼前的动人情景扫视了一回，然后合上写生本，屈尊地说道：“你的口音蛮漂亮，日后必成好朗诵者。建议你学一学，德语对于教师来说是很有价值的才艺。我得去照看格莱丝，她在乱蹦乱跳呢。”凯特小姐说着慢慢走开了，他一边走，一边自言自语道：“我可不是来照料女家庭教师的，虽然她确实年轻貌美。这些美国佬真是怪人，劳里跟她们一起恐怕会学坏了哩。”

“我忘了英国人瞧不起女家教，不像我们平等相待。”美格望着凯特小姐远去的身影懊恼地说道。

“可悲的是，据我所知，男家教在那边，日子也不好过。对于我们打工仔来说，再没有比美国更好的地方了，玛格丽特小姐。”布鲁克先生显得如此满足，如此快乐，美格也不好意思再哀叹自己命苦了。

“那真高兴我生活在美国。我不喜欢我的工作，不过还是从中得到很大的满足，所以我不抱怨，我只希望能像你一样喜欢教书。”

“如果有劳里这样的学生，我想你就会喜欢的。可惜我明年就要失去他了。”布鲁克先生边说边在草坪上狠命戳洞。

“上大学，是吧？”美格嘴里这样问，眼睛却在说：“那你自己干什么呢？”

“是的，该上大学了，他准备好了。他一走，我就参军。部队上需要我。”

“我真高兴！”美格叫道，“我也认为每个青年都应该有这个心愿，虽然留在家里的母亲和姐妹们日子会感到难过。”她说着伤心起来。

“我没有母亲姐妹，在乎我死活的朋友也寥寥无几。”布鲁克先生有点苦涩地说道。他心不在焉地把干枯的玫瑰放到戳好的洞里，像小坟墓似的用土盖上。

“劳里和他爷爷就会十分在乎，万一你受了伤，我们也全都会很难过的。”美格真心地说。

“谢谢，听了令人高兴。”布鲁克先生振作起来，说道。一语未毕，内德骑着那匹老马笨拙地走过来，在小姐们面前炫耀他的骑术，于是这一天就再也没有安宁了。

“你难道不喜欢骑马吗？”格莱丝问艾美。她俩刚刚和大家一起跟着内德绕田野跑了一圈，这时站着在歇气。

“喜欢极了。我爸爸有钱那时候，美格姐常常骑，但我们现在没有马了，只有‘爱伦树’。”艾美笑着补充说。

“跟我说说，‘爱伦树’是一头驴子吗？”格莱丝好奇地问。

“嘿，你不知道，乔爱马爱得发疯，我也一样，但我们没有马，只有一个旧横鞍。我们园子里有一棵苹果树，长了一枝低树丫，乔便把马鞍放上去，在弯起处系上缰绳，我们有兴致时，就跳上‘爱伦树’驰骋。”

“多有趣！”格莱丝笑了，“我家里有一匹矮种马，我几乎每天都跟弗雷德和凯特一起去海德公园骑马，真惬意；我的朋友们都去，整个骑马道都是绅士小姐们的身影。”

“哎呀，多带劲！希望有一天能出国，但我宁愿去罗马[4]，不去罗欧。”艾美说。她压根儿不知道罗欧是什么，死活不肯发问。

坐在两个小姑娘后面的弗兰克听到了她们说话。看到生龙活虎的小伙子们在做各种各样的滑稽体操动作，他很不耐烦地一把推开自己的拐杖。贝丝正在收拾散乱一地的“猜作者”卡片，闻声抬起头来，羞怯而友好地问：

“恐怕你累了吧，我能为你效劳吗？”

“跟我说说话吧，求你啦，一个人枯坐闷死了。”弗兰克回答。显然他在家里被悉心照料惯了。

贝丝害羞，即使让她发表拉丁语演说也不会比这更困难。但她现在无路可逃，乔不在身边挡驾，可怜的小伙子又眼巴巴地望着她，她于是勇于一试。

“你看谈什么好呢？”她边收拾卡片边问，把卡片扎起来时洒落了一半。

“嗯，我想听听板球、划船和打猎这类事情。”弗兰克说道。他尚未懂得自己的兴趣应该是力所能及的事情。

“天哪！我该怎么办？我对这些一无所知。”贝丝想，仓皇之间忘记了小伙子的不幸。她想引他说话，便说：“我从来没见过打猎，不过我猜你熟门熟路的。”

“以前是，但我再也不能打猎了，跳越一道该死的五栅门时伤了腿，再也不能骑马放猎狗了。”弗兰克长叹一声说。贝丝见状直恨自己粗心无知，说错了话。

“你们的鹿儿远比我们丑陋的水牛美丽。”她说道，转身望着开阔的草原寻找灵感，很高兴自己曾读过一本乔十分喜欢的男孩子读物。

事实证明水牛具有镇静功能，令人满意。贝丝一心一意要让弗兰克乐起来，心里早没有了自己。姐妹们看到她竟和一个原来躲避不迭的可怕男孩谈得滔滔不绝，全都又惊又喜，贝丝对此却全然不觉。

“好心的人儿！她怜悯他，所以对他好。”乔说道，从棒球场那边对着她微笑。

“我一向都说她是个小圣人。”美格用不容置疑的口吻说。

“很久都没有听弗兰克笑得这样开心了。”格莱丝对艾美说。她们正坐在一处，边谈论玩偶，边用橡果壳做茶具。

“我贝丝姐有时候很努力，是个令人瑕疵的姑娘。”艾美对贝丝的成功很高兴，说道。她的意思是“令人痴迷”，不过反正格莱丝也不知道这两个词的确切意思，“令人瑕疵”听起来不错，而且令对方刮目相看。

看了即兴马戏表演，下了狐狸大雁棋，打了一场槌球友谊赛，不觉一个下午就过去了。等到夕阳西下，大家拆了帐篷，收拾好篮子，卸下三门柱，把行李装上船。他们一起顺流而下，放声歌唱。内德伤感起来，用柔和的颤音唱起了小夜曲，从那忧郁的过门：





孤独，孤独，哎哟！孤独。





唱到歌词：





我们各自青春年少，各自有心，

呵，为什么要这样拉开冷漠的距离？





他趁机望着美格，表情有气无力，美格忍不住扑哧一笑，把歌声打断了。

“怎能对我这样无情？”趁大家活跃地说话时，他咕哝道，“你全天都和那个古板的英国女人混在一起，这会儿又来轻慢我了。”

“不是有意的，只是你很滑稽，实在忍不住。”美格答道，避而不谈他第一部分的责备。说真的，她对莫法特家晚会以及后来的闲话记忆犹新，整天都躲着他。

内德生气了，转头向萨莉寻求安慰，他小气地说道：“你说这姑娘是不是一点风情也不解啊？”

“半点也不解，不过她是个乖乖儿。”萨莉回答，虽然坦白了朋友的缺点，却维护了朋友。

“反正不是受惊的‘怪鹿’吧。”内德想说俏皮话，无奈的年轻人火候未到，果然不成功。

在早晨集合的草地上，大家互道晚安，依依惜别，因为沃恩姐弟们还要去加拿大呢。四姐妹穿过花园回家时，凯特小姐目送着她们说：“尽管美国姑娘感情外露，但熟悉之后，便知道她们十分迷人。”她的话里已经放下了恩赐的腔调。

“我同意你的意见。”布鲁克先生说。

第十三章　空中楼阁


九月的一个下午，天气晴朗，劳里躺在吊床上舒服地摇来摇去，一边揣摩着那几个邻居在干什么，可又懒得出门去瞧个究竟。这一天他过得毫无收获，糟糕透顶，为此他正在闹情绪，恨不得能重新再过一次。闷热的天气使他全身懒洋洋的，书也不读，令布鲁克先生无法忍受；又有半个下午在弹琴，弄得爷爷很不开心；他还恶作剧，暗示他的一只狗快要发疯，把女佣们吓得半死；然后又跟马夫吵了一架，无端地指责对方没照看好他的马。最后，他躺在吊床里，为世人皆愚而愤愤不平。阳光明媚，周围一片宁静，心情烦躁的他，也渐渐平静下来。仰望着头上的七叶树绿意盎然，他做起了白日梦。他想象着自己在海上颠簸，作环球航行，一阵说话声传来，他从梦中惊醒，回到了岸上。透过吊床的网孔，他看到马奇家的姑娘们正走出来，好像要出游。

“那些女孩子现在究竟要干吗？”劳里心想。他睁开蒙眬的睡眼想看个清楚，邻居姑娘们的穿着确实有点古怪。每个人都头戴挂着边的大帽子，肩背棕色亚麻布小袋，手里还拿着一根棍子。美格拿着坐垫，乔夹着书，贝丝拎个篮子，艾美抱着纸夹。她们悄无声息地穿过花园，从后面一扇小门出去，爬上小山，向河边走去。

“哎，真行啊！”劳里心想，“去野餐也不叫我一声。她们没有开船的钥匙，不可能乘船去。也许是她们忘了，我得给她们拿去，顺便看看到底去干什么。”

帽子倒有半打，可他还是费了老长时间才找到一顶，然后又找钥匙，最后发现竟在自己的口袋里。等到他翻过篱笆，朝她们跑去时，姑娘们早已不见了。他抄近路来到船库，等着她们出现，见没人来，就登上小山放眼远眺。山坡上长着一片松树，绿林深处传来一个声音，清脆得胜过松林的沙沙声和蟋蟀昏昏欲睡的鸣叫声。

“这里风景真美！”劳里暗自赞叹。他透过灌木丛眺望，顿时精神抖擞，心情舒畅。

眼前果真是风景如画，姐妹们围坐在树荫下，斑驳的树影在身上摇曳不定，清风夹着花香撩弄着秀发，轻拂着发热的面颊。林中小居民都照常起居，仿佛在场的不是陌生人，而是老朋友。美格坐在坐垫上，雪白的双手正在灵巧地做针线活，粉红色的衣裙，在绿色的映衬下，宛如一朵鲜艳的玫瑰。贝丝正在捡松果，不远处的铁杉树下，已经厚厚地堆了一层，她能用这些松果做出漂亮的玩意。艾美正对着一簇蕨草素描。乔边朗读边做编织活。劳里看着看着，脸上阴沉了下来，觉得自己是不请自来，应该离开了。可他还在流连，因为家里实在孤独，林中这批人虽说安静无事，可对于不甘寂寞的他又具有巨大的吸引力。他站着纹丝不动，一只忙于觅食的松鼠从身边的一棵松树上跳下来，突然看见了他，尖声责骂着往后一蹦。贝丝闻声抬头一看，看到桦树后那张渴望的脸，于是会心一笑，向他致意。

“请问能过来吗？打扰你们吗？”他慢慢地走上前问。

美格皱起眉头，可乔不服气地瞪了她一眼，立刻说：“当然可以。本该先问问你的，只是我们觉得，你可能瞧不起这种女孩子的游戏。”

“我向来都喜欢你们的游戏，可要是美格不欢迎的话，我这就走。”

“我并不反对，可你得做点什么。这里可不兴闲着没事干。”美格神情庄重地说，可语气里又带有几分亲切。

“多谢。要是能让我待一会儿，做什么都行。你们知道，家里闷得像撒哈拉大沙漠。要我做什么？做针线、读书、拣松果、画素描，要不都做？说吧，我没问题。”劳里坐下来，一副顺从的样子，看了让人觉得高兴。

“我要把袜子后跟织好，你替我把这故事读完。”乔说着递给他一本书。

“遵命，小姐。”劳里温顺地答应，说着就读起来，他要努力证明，为有幸参加“勤劳大家缝协会”而感激万分。

故事并不长，读完后，他斗胆提出几个问题，犒赏自己。

“请问小姐，能否问问，这个富有魅力和教育意义的机构是不是新组织？”

“你们愿意告诉他吗？”美格问三个妹妹。

“他会笑的。”艾美警告道。

“管他呢？”乔说。

“我想他会喜欢的。”贝丝接着说。

“我当然会喜欢！保证不笑。说出来吧，乔，别害怕。”

“谁怕你啊！哦，你知道我们过去常常表演《天路历程》。我们整个冬季和夏季都兢兢业业的，没有放弃。”

“是的，我知道。”劳里说，机灵地点点头。

“谁告诉你的？”乔问。

“小精灵。”

“不，是我。那天晚上你们都出去了，他委靡不振，我便告诉了他，逗他乐呢。他很喜欢，所以别骂，姐。”贝丝怯怯地说。

“你守不住秘密。不过算了，现在倒省事了。”

“请接着说吧。”劳里看到乔有点儿不高兴，专心做活儿，便说。

“噢，难道她没告诉你我们这个新计划吗？喏，为了尽量不虚度假期，每人都定下一个任务，并全力执行。假期即将结束，定额也全部完成了，我们真高兴，没有蹉跎岁月。”

“不错，我看做得很好。”劳里想到自己无所事事地打发日子，十分后悔。

“妈妈要我们尽量到外面走走，所以我们把活计拿出来，顺便散散心。为了助兴，我们打扮成朝圣者的样子，东西放在袋子里，戴上旧帽子，拄着拐杖来爬山，几年前就经常这样玩。我们管这座山叫做‘逍遥山’，登高望远，可以看到我们向往居住的乡村。”

劳里坐起来，顺着乔的指点望去。透过树林的缝隙，可以看到一条碧绿的大河，河对岸是茫茫的草地，一直看到大城市的郊区，举目远眺还可以看见一脉高耸入云的青山。正值秋日，夕阳西下，天边霞光四射，蔚为壮观。金色的紫霞萦绕着山顶，银白色的山峰在万道红光的照耀下，闪闪发光，宛如天城仙宇的塔尖。

“真美！”劳里轻声赞叹。他一向都很善于欣赏美。

“景色总是这么美，我们都喜欢欣赏的。从不千篇一律，总是气象万千。”艾美答道，希望自己能把这美景画下来。

“乔谈到了我们向往居住的地方。她说的可是真正的乡下，有猪呀、鸡呀，还可以晒干草。那该多好，不过我希望真有这样美丽的地方，那样，我们就可以去了。”贝丝若有所思地说。

“还有个地方比这里更美。等我们学好了，就能慢慢过去了。”美格甜美的声音答道。

“要等这么久，又这么难，我真想马上插翅飞过去，和那些燕子一样，飞进那扇壮丽的大门。”

“贝丝，你迟早都会到达的，不用担心。”乔说，“只有我要奋斗、要拼搏、要攀登、要等待，最终可能永远都进不去。”

“要是能安慰你的话，我会陪着你。我先要长途旅行，才能看得见你的天城。万一我迟到了，你要替我说句好话，你会吗，贝丝？”

小伙子脸上的表情让他的这位小朋友感到不安。可她两眼默默地望着变幻不定的云朵，打气说：“要是人们真的想去，真的一生都在努力，我想就会进去的。我相信那扇门上没有锁，门口也没人把守着。我老想，肯定和图画中画的一样，当可怜的基督徒蹚过河水升天的时候，闪着金光的天神会伸出双手来迎接。”

“要是我们梦中的空中楼阁都能实现的话，我们都能住进去，那是不是很有趣？”乔沉默片刻后问。

“我有这么多梦想，真不知道该选哪个好？”劳里平躺在地上说着，把一颗松果扔向刚才暴露了他行踪的松鼠。

“要选最喜欢的那个。是什么？”美格问。

“要是我说了，你也会说吗？”

“会的，要是妹妹们也说的话。”

“我们会的，劳里，该你了。”

“我打算，先把世界游个遍，再在德国定居，尽情享受音乐。我要成为著名的乐师，世人都跑来听我表演。我永远都不用担心金钱和生意，只想享受生活，做想做的事。这就是我的钟爱楼阁。你的呢，美格？”

玛格丽特似乎觉得说出来有点难。她拿起一根蕨草在眼前挥动着，仿佛要驱散其实并不存在的小昆虫。她慢吞吞地说：“我梦想有一座漂亮的宅子，里面尽是各种豪华的东西——美味的食品、漂亮的衣服、阔气的家具，还有和善的人和大把大把的钞票。我要当女主人，有很多用人，一切都按我的意思来安排，那样我就一点都不用打工了。我会多么开心！到那时，我不会偷闲，只会多做好事，让每个人都深深地爱我。”

“那你梦想的楼阁里就不要男主人了？”劳里顽皮地问。

“我说了‘和善的人’，知道不？”美格说话时仔细地把鞋系好，才没让大家看到她的脸。

“你干吗不说想要个好丈夫，他博学多才、温柔体贴，再养几个小孩，要像天使一样？要是少了他们，你的楼阁可不会十全十美。”乔率直地说。她现在还想象不到缠绵的爱情，更瞧不起浪漫故事，可对小说里的那些，她却情有独钟。

“你的楼阁里什么都没有，只有几匹马、几个墨水瓶，再加上几本小说。”美格气愤地回答。

“这哪里不好？我要一个马厩，养满阿拉伯骏马，几间屋子，里面堆满书，再用魔法墨水瓶来写东西，这样我的作品就会和劳里的音乐齐名。在搬进楼阁之前，我想先干一番大事——英勇的、杰出的大事，总之是等我死了都难被忘记的大事。现在还不知道是什么，可我时刻准备着，说不定哪一天能石破天惊。我想我得写书，名利双收，才合我心意，这就是我最大的梦想。”

“我的梦想是平平安安地待在家里，和爸爸、妈妈住在一起，帮他们看家。”贝丝心满意足地说。

“难道别的什么都不想吗？”劳里问。

“有了那架小钢琴，我已经很知足了。只希望我们都能身体健康，能守在一起，就足够了。”

“我有很多愿望，可最中意的是想成为画家，去罗马，画一些漂亮的画，成为世界上最好的画家。”这是艾美一个小小的心愿。

“我们个个胸怀大志，对吧？我们每个人，贝丝除外，都想名利双收，在每个方面都做得很出色。我在纳闷，我们中间有谁能如愿以偿。”劳里说着嚼起了青草，活像一头冥思苦想的牛犊。

“我有打开楼阁的钥匙，不过能不能打开这扇门，还要等着瞧。”乔神秘地说。

“我有打开楼阁的钥匙，不过就是不让我打开。去他的大学！”劳里咕哝着，一边不耐烦地叹息道。

“这是我的钥匙！”艾美挥动着铅笔喊道。

“我可没有。”美格失望地说。

“不，你有。”劳里立刻回答。

“在哪里？”

“你的脸上。”

“胡说。那有什么用？”

“等着瞧吧，看它是否会给你带来好事。”小伙子回答。他想到自己知道一个小秘密，不由放声大笑。

美格用蕨草遮着涨得通红的脸，可什么都没问，只是望着河对岸，脸上流露出渴望的神情。那天布鲁克讲骑士故事的时候，脸上也带着同样的表情。

“如果十年后还都活着，我们再聚首，看看有多少人如愿以偿，或者接近了多少。”乔说，她总是胸有成竹的。

“天哪！到时我该多大了——二十七岁！”美格喊道。现在她刚刚十七，却以为是大人了。

“你和我将是二十六岁，特迪[1]，贝丝二十四，艾美二十二。那时，我们将年高德劭了！”乔说。

“希望在此前做出一些值得自豪的事情。可我是个懒汉，恐怕要蹉跎了，乔。”

“需要一个动机，妈妈说，一旦有了动机，你肯定就会干得十分出色。”

“真的？我对天发誓一定努力，但愿有这样的机会！”劳里叫道，突然来了劲头，坐起来，“我能讨爷爷的欢心，就很应该知足了；我也确实尽力而为，但你们知道，这样做跟我的性格犯冲，真难哪。他要我像他年轻时一样，做个印度商人，但这还不如把我毙掉。我痛恨茶叶、丝绸、香料，痛恨他的破船运来的每一种垃圾。这些船只归我所有后，什么时候沉到海底我都不会在乎。我去读大学，应该遂了他的心愿吧，我献给他四年，他就该放我一马，不用做生意，但他顽固不化，非要我亦步亦趋地学他，除非我像父亲一样离家出走，自得其乐。如果家里有人陪着老人的话，我明天就远走高飞。”

劳里言辞激烈，仿佛一点点挑衅就能惹得他把这番说辞付诸行动。他正处于突飞猛进的发育时期，虽然行动懒洋洋的，却有一种年轻人的逆反心理，内心躁动不安，渴望能独自闯天下。

“我有个主意，你乘坐你们家的大船出走，闯荡一番后再回家。”乔说。想到这么大胆的英雄行为，她任想象力驰骋，同情心也被她所谓的“特迪的冤屈”激发起来。

“那样不对，乔，不可以这样说话，劳里也不能听从你的坏主意。应该按照爷爷的意愿去做，好孩子。”美格的口吻母性十足，“要刻苦努力上大学，看到你尽自己的能力来取悦他，我肯定他对你不会这么强硬，这么不讲理。正像你所说的，家里没有人来陪伴他，爱他了。如果你擅自把他抛下，你也永远不会原谅自己的。不要消沉，不要烦恼，要尽心尽责，这样你就能得到报偿，受人敬爱，就像好人布鲁克先生一样。”

“你知道他些什么？”劳里问。他对这个好建议心存感激，但对这番教诲却不以为然，刚才他不同寻常地发泄了一番，现在很高兴把话题从自己身上转开。

“只知道你爷爷告诉我们的那些——他精心照顾老母，直到为她送终；由于不愿抛下母亲，国外很好的人家请他当私人教师他也不去；还有，他现在赡养一位护理过他母亲的老太太，却从不告诉别人，而是尽力而为，慷慨、耐心、善良。”

“没错，是个大好人！”劳里由衷地说。而美格这时沉默不语，双颊通红，神情热切。“爷爷就是喜欢这样，背地里把人家了解得一清二楚，然后到处宣扬他的美德，使大家都喜欢他。布鲁克不会明白，为什么你母亲会待他这样好。她请他跟我一同过去做客，以礼相待，亲切周到。他认为她简直十全十美，回来后好些天都把她挂在嘴边，接着又热情洋溢地谈论你们众姐妹。若我有朝一日如愿以偿，会让你们看到我为布鲁克做点什么。”

“不如从现在做起，不要再把他折磨得生不如死。”美格尖刻地说。

“你怎么知道我让他生气呢，小姐？”

“每次他离开的时候看脸色就知道了。如果你表现好，他就显得心满意足，脚步轻快；如果你淘气了，他就脸色阴沉，脚步拖拉，仿佛要回去改进工作。”

“好啊，这样不错耶！原来，你通过布鲁克的脸色，就把我的成绩好坏全都登记着，对吧？我只看到他经过你家窗口时躬身微笑，却不知道你从中悟出一封电报呢。”

“没有的事。别生气，还有，噢，别告诉他我说了什么！我这么说，只是关心你的进步而已。你知道这里说的全是悄悄话儿。”美格叫起来，想到说话一时大意，不禁有点害怕起来。

“我从不搬弄是非的。”劳里答道，脸上露出特有的“大人物”的神气，乔如此描述他偶然露出的一种表情。“不过，既然布鲁克要做晴雨表，我就得注意，让他报告好天气就是了。”

“请别动气。我刚才并非是要说教或搬弄是非，也并非出于无聊。我只是觉得，乔这么怂恿你，日后你会为那种情绪后悔的。你对我们这么好，我们把你当作亲兄弟，把心里话儿都掏出来的。对不起了，我是一片好心。”美格热情而又腼腆地打了个手势，伸出手来。

想到自己刚才一时懊恼，劳里不好意思了，他紧紧握住那只小手，坦诚地说：“说对不起的应该是我。我脾气暴躁，而且今天一整天都心情不好。你指出我的缺点，像亲姐妹一样待我，我心里高兴。一时有莽撞得罪之处，请不要放在心上，我还要谢谢你呢。”

他一心要表示自己没有动气，尽量表现得和颜悦色——为美格绕棉线，替乔朗诵诗歌，帮贝丝摇落松果，帮艾美画蕨叶，证明自己是名副其实的“勤劳大家缝协会”会员。正当他们热火朝天地讨论着乌龟（河里刚刚爬出了这么一只和蔼可亲的动物）的驯养习性的时候，一阵铃声远远飘过来，通知她们汉娜已把茶泡开了，现在赶回家吃晚饭时间刚刚好。

“我可以再来吗？”劳里问。

“可以，可你要好好表现，好好读书，就像识字课本上要求孩子们做的那样。”美格笑着说。

“我会努力的。”

“那你就来吧，我会教你打毛线，跟苏格兰男子一样。现在袜子的需求很大呢。”乔补充说，她挥动着手中的袜子，就像挥舞蓝色的毛线大旗一样。这样，她们便在大门口分手了。

那天晚上，贝丝在月光下为劳伦斯先生弹琴。劳里站在门帘的阴影里，聆听小乐师的表演。那朴素的旋律总能使他浮躁的心情平静下来。劳里注视着坐在一边的老人，只见他一手托着满头白发的脑袋，深情地回忆着死去的小孙女。想起当天下午的对话，男孩决定心甘情愿地做出牺牲，心里暗自说：“让我的空中楼阁滚蛋吧，我要和亲爱的老人守在一起。他需要我，因为我是他的一切。”

第十四章　秘密


十月，天开始冷起来，下午也变短了，乔在阁楼上忙得不可开交。和煦的阳光从天窗上照进来，两三个小时过去了，乔一直坐在旧沙发上奋笔疾书，面前放着一个箱子，上面摊满了她的稿纸。她的爱鼠“抓扒”在头顶的横梁上散步，身边跟着它的长子，这小家伙显然对它那几根胡须感到扬扬得意。乔全神贯注地写着，直到写完最后一页，然后龙飞凤舞地签上自己的名字，把笔一扔，喊道：

“行了，我已经尽力了！要是这还不行，只能等到下次长进了再说吧。”

她靠在沙发上，把稿子细读了一遍，又时不时地画上几笔，添上不少感叹号，看上去像一个个小气球。然后，她用一根漂亮的红丝带把稿纸扎起来，又郑重其事地端详了一下。毫无疑问，这是她的呕心沥血之作。乔在阁楼上的书桌，是一只钉在墙上的旧铁柜，里面放着稿纸和几本书，很安全。只要把门一关，同样具有文学天赋的“抓扒”，平时见书就啃，像个流动图书馆似的喜欢把留在外边的书吞在肚子里，现在只好望柜兴叹了。乔从铁柜子里取出另一份稿子，把两份一起放入口袋，然后悄悄地下楼，留下鼠友去啃笔尖、尝墨水。

她不声不响地戴上帽子，穿好外衣，从后窗口爬到一个低矮的阳台顶，纵身跳到一块草地上，迂回上了大路。至此，她定了定神，搭上一辆过路的马车直奔城里。一路上她满脸喜悦，却又神秘兮兮的。

无论谁见了，都会觉得她的行动非同寻常。一下马车，乔就大步向前，来到一条繁华大街上，在一个门牌号码前才慢下来。她好不容易才找到地方，走进门，抬头望了一眼肮脏的楼梯，呆呆地站了一会儿，突然飞快地冲到街上，速度毫不亚于她来的时候。就这样，她进进出出好几个来回，逗得对面楼上一个闲靠在窗口的黑眼睛小先生哑然失笑。第三趟返回的时候，乔抖了一下身子，压低帽子遮住眼睛，然后朝楼上走去，看上去似乎准备把满嘴的牙都拔掉。

门口有许多招牌，其中一块是牙医的。一副假颌慢慢地一张一翕，里面一副洁白的牙齿引人注目。小先生定睛看了片刻，然后穿上外套，戴上帽子，下楼站在对面房子的门口。他打了个寒战，笑着说：“她这种人就知道独来独往，她要是痛得受不了，就需要有人护送回家的。”

过了十分钟，乔满脸通红地冲下楼，那模样就像一个人刚受过残酷的折磨。她看到年轻人时，神情一点都不高兴，点了点头就从他身边过去了。可他跟了上来，同情地问：“难受吧？”

“还好。”

“还蛮快的。”

“是的，感谢上帝。”

“怎么一个人来？”

“不想让人知道。”

“从没见过你这样古怪的人。你弄了几个？”

乔看着她的朋友，有点莫名其妙，接着便开始哈哈大笑，好像有什么事逗她开心。

“两个，但得等上一个礼拜才能知道结果。”

“你笑什么？乔，你搞什么鬼？”劳里迷惑不解地问。

“你也是啊。你在上面那间台球室干什么，先生？”

“对不起，小姐，那不是台球室，是健身房，我在学击剑。”

“那我真高兴。”

“为什么？”

“你可以教我，这样我们演《哈姆雷特》时，你可以扮雷奥提斯，击剑一场就有好戏看了。”

劳里放声大笑，那由衷的笑声惹得几个过路人也禁不住笑起来。

“演不演《哈姆雷特》我都会教你，这种活动简直其乐无穷，令人精神焕发。不过，你刚才说‘真高兴’说得那么果断，我想一定有别的原因，对吗，嗯？”

“对，我真高兴你没有去台球室，希望你不要去那种地方。你平时去吗？”

“不常去。”

“但愿你别去。”

“没什么害处的，乔。我家里也有台球的，但没有好对手，根本没劲。我喜欢台球，有时便来和内德·莫法特或其他伙伴比一比。”

“哎哟，真为你惋惜，你慢慢就会玩上瘾，就会浪费时间金钱，变得跟那些可恶的男孩一样。我一直希望你会自尊自爱，不令朋友失望。”乔摇着脑袋说。

“难道小伙子偶尔玩一下无伤大雅的游戏，就丧失尊严了吗？”劳里恼火地问。

“那得看他怎么玩和在什么地方玩。我不喜欢内德这帮人，也希望你别沾上他们。妈妈不许我们请他到家玩，虽然他想来。如果你变得像他一样，她便不会让我们再这么一起嬉闹了。”

“真的？”劳里焦急地问。

“没错，她受不了时髦青年，她宁愿把我们全都关进硬纸帽盒里，也不让我们跟他们打交道。”

“哦，她还不必拿出硬纸帽盒来。我不是时髦分子，也不想做那种人，但我有时真喜欢没有害处的玩乐，你不喜欢吗？”

“喜欢，没有人在乎这样娱乐，想玩就玩吧，只是别玩疯了，好吗？不然，我们的好日子就完了。”

“我会做个双重纯洁的圣人的。”

“我可受不了圣人，就做个纯朴、正派的好男孩吧，我们便永不离弃你。如果你像金家儿子那样，我可真不知道该怎么办。他钱多，却不知怎么花，反而酗酒聚赌，离家出走，还仿冒父亲的名字，真是可怕。”

“你以为我也会学样？过奖了！”

“不，不是——哎呀，不是的！但我听人说，金钱能诱惑人，有时我真希望你没钱，那我就不必担心了。”

“你担心我吗，乔？”

“有点儿担心，你有时显得情绪不佳，心怀不满。你个性极强，一旦走上歪路，恐怕很难拦住。”

劳里不声不响走了一会儿，乔望着他，但愿自己口有遮拦。虽然他嘴唇挂着微笑，但似乎是在嘲笑她的告诫，眼睛里分明怒气冲冲。

“你是不是打算一路上给我训话？”这时他问。

“当然不是。干吗？”

“如果是，我就乘公车回家；如果不是，我愿和你一块步行，并告诉你一些趣闻。”

“那我不再说教了，很想听听你的趣闻。”

“那很好，走吧。这是秘密，要是我讲了，你也要把你的秘密告诉我。”

“我没有秘密。”乔说，突然又止住了，想起自己还真有一个。

“你自己心里明白——你什么也瞒不住的。还是坦白出来吧，不然我也不说了。”劳里大声道。

“你的秘密好听吗？”

“哦，那还用说！都是你熟悉的人，很有趣的！你应该听听，我早就忍不住想讲了。来吧，你先说。”

“在家里你一点都不能说，做得到吗？”

“一句都不说。”

“你不会在背后笑我吧？”

“绝对不会。”

“你会的，想知道什么，总有办法从人家那里套出来，真不知道是怎么得逞的，反正你是天生就知道哄人。”

“谢谢夸奖。痛快说吧。”

“好吧，我把两篇短篇小说投给了报社编辑，下个礼拜给答复。”乔在她好朋友的耳边嘀咕。

“好哇！马奇小姐，美国著名作家！”劳里大声道，把帽子往上一扔，又接住了。这时他们已经到了城外，两只鸭、四只猫、五只母鸡和六个爱尔兰孩子见此都乐坏了。

“嘘！我敢肯定，不会有戏的。可不试一下，我不甘心。这事我没提过，因为不想让别人失望。”

“肯定能成功。怎么了，那些每天发表的东西一半都是垃圾，相比之下，你的小说都称得上是莎士比亚的杰作了。要是看到它们见报，难道不有趣？难道不应该为我们的女作家感到自豪吗？”

乔眼睛一亮，有人信任总是很开心。朋友的赞扬总比报纸上十几篇吹嘘文章要悦耳得多。

“你的秘密是什么？公平交易，特迪，不然，我永远都不会再相信你了。”她说。劳里的鼓励使她心中燃起了耀眼的希望之火，可乔正努力熄灭它。

“说出来可能会有麻烦，可我没有保证要保密，所以说了没关系。只要我有好消息，都会告诉你的，要不然，心里憋得慌。我知道美格手套的下落。”

“就这个？”乔失望地问。劳里点点头，满脸神秘地眨眨眼。

“这足够了，等我说了，你就会明白的。”

“那好，说吧。”

劳里俯下身，在乔耳边嘀咕了三个字，乔的脸上发生了滑稽的变化。她站着，呆呆地盯着他，显得诧异又恼火。她好一会儿才继续向前走，并厉声问道：“你是怎么知道的？”

“看到的。”

“在哪里？”

“口袋里。”

“一直在吗？”

“在的，那不是很浪漫吗？”

“不，让人讨厌。”

“难道不喜欢？”

“当然不喜欢。真荒唐，这不行。天哪！美格知道了会怎么说？”

“你跟谁都别说，注意了。”

“我可没答应你。”

“有默契的，我可是信任你的。”

“好吧，我暂时不说。可我觉得恶心，你还是没跟我说的好。”

“我还以为你会高兴呢。”

“想到有人会过来把美格抢走？没门。”

“有人来把你抢走的时候，你就好受了。”

“我倒要看看，谁敢。”乔恶狠狠地大声嚷道。

“我也想瞧瞧！”劳里想到这里笑了起来。

“我想，我这人听不得秘密。听了你说的那件事，感到脑袋里乱七八糟的。”乔说，没有丝毫的感激之意。

“和我一起往山下跑，你就会没事的。”劳里提议。

四下里看不到人，在她前面，平整的山路向前倾斜着延伸下去，确实诱人。乔抵挡不住诱惑，冲了下去，很快就把帽子和梳子都丢在了身后，跑的时候发卡也掉得满地都是。劳里先到终点，看到自己的疗法灵验了，就颇为满意。他的阿塔兰塔[1]靠近了，只见她气喘吁吁，头发飞散，眼睛发亮，脸颊红润，脸上没有丝毫不快了。

“我真想变一匹马，那就可以在这清新的空气中尽情驰骋，而不用气喘吁吁了。跑步真是太棒了，但看我这副狼狈相。去，把我的东西捡回来，就像小天使一样，你本来就是嘛。”乔说着坐到一棵枫树下面，绯红的叶子已经落满了河岸边。

劳里慢吞吞地离开，去收拾丢落的东西，乔束起辫子，心里祈祷不要有人走过，撞见这副狼狈相。但一个人恰恰走过来，不是别人，正是美格。她在串门，穿着整齐的节庆服装，更显出淑女的风韵。

“你在这里干什么？”她问，惊讶而不失风度地望着头发蓬乱的妹妹。

“捡枫叶。”乔温顺地回答，一面挑拣刚刚拢来的一捧枫叶。

“还有发卡。”劳里接过话头，把半打发卡丢到乔膝上，“这条路长了发卡，美格，还长了梳子和棕色的草帽。”

“你刚刚跑步来着，乔。怎么能这样子？你什么时候才不再胡闹？”美格责备道，一面理理袖口，一面又把被风吹起的头发抚平。

“等我人老走不动了，不得不用上拐杖，那时再说吧。别使劲催我提早长大成人，美格。看到你一下子变了个人，已经够难受了，就让我做个小姑娘吧，能做多久是多久。”

说着，乔埋下头，让枫叶遮住自己那轻轻颤动的双唇。她最近感觉到，玛格丽特正迅速长成一个妇人。姐妹分离是迟早的事情，但劳里讲的秘密，使这一天变得迫在眉睫，她害怕呀。劳里看到她满脸愁容，为了分散美格的注意力，赶紧问：“你刚才上哪儿去串门了，穿得这么漂亮？”

“加德纳家。萨莉跟我详谈了贝尔·莫法特的婚礼。婚礼极尽奢华，新人已去巴黎过冬了。想想那该有多么快乐！”

“你是不是艳羡哪，美格？”劳里问。

“恐怕是吧。”

“那我真高兴！”乔咕哝道，把帽子猛地一拉戴上系好。

“为什么？”美格吃惊地问。

“如果你看重财富，就绝不会去嫁一个穷人。”乔说。劳里暗暗示意她说话小心，她却不悦地对他皱皱眉头。

“我永远不会‘去嫁’什么人的。”美格说罢扬长而去。乔和劳里跟在后面，一面笑一面窃窃私语，还向河中打水漂。“表现就像小孩子。”美格心里这样说，不过若不是穿着最漂亮的衣服，她可能也忍不住和他们一起闹了。

整整一两礼拜，乔行动古怪，搞得姐妹们迷惑不解。每当邮递员打铃，她都会冲到门口；每每遇到布鲁克先生，她都显得很粗鲁。她只是一个人坐着，愁眉苦脸地望着美格，偶尔莫名其妙地跳起来推搡她，接着亲吻她。还有劳里和她老是互打暗号，谈什么“展翅的雄鹰”。姑娘们最后只好宣布：这两位都精神错乱。乔爬窗后的第二个礼拜六，劳里在满园子里追乔，最后在艾美的花棚里抓住了。美格坐在窗口做针线活，见此情景，心中便有几分不快。他们到底在那里干什么，美格看不到，只听到刺耳的笑声，接着是窃窃私语，还有报纸翻响的声音。

“真拿这小姑娘没办法，就是不肯像个淑女模样。”美格一边不悦地望着两人赛跑，一边叹息。

“我倒希望她不肯，现在这样有多风趣可爱。”贝丝说。看到乔与别人而不是和自己分享秘密，她心里不免有点难过，却绝不表露出来。

“这样是令人讨厌，但永远都不可能使她commy la fo[2]的。”艾美接着说。她坐在那里为自己制作一些新饰边，一头鬈发顺顺当当地扎成两股，十分好看，令她自觉优雅无比，仪态万方。

过了几分钟，乔冲了进来，躺在沙发上假装看报。

“报纸上有什么奇闻逸事吗？”美格屈尊地问。

“只有小说一篇，觉得算不上什么。”乔回答，小心翼翼地遮住了报名标记。

“还是大声读出来吧。我们开心，你也不会再胡闹。”艾美用大人的口吻说。

“什么题目？”贝丝问，心里纳闷，乔为什么一直都用报纸遮着脸。

“《画王争霸》。”

“题目蛮好听的，快念。”美格说。

乔用力地清了一下嗓子，深深地吸了口气，然后飞快地读起来。姑娘们兴致勃勃地听着，故事浪漫而有点伤感，最后大多数人物都死了。

“我喜欢其中写漂亮图画的那段。”等乔停下来，艾美称赞道。

“我喜欢描写情人的那部分。维奥拉和安杰洛是我们最喜欢的两个名字，是不是有点怪？”美格说着擦了擦湿润的眼睛。的确，“爱情的部分”写得非常凄惨哀怨。

“谁写的？”贝丝瞟了一眼乔的脸色，然后问道。

读报人突然坐了起来，把报纸一扔，露出通红的脸蛋，严肃的神情中夹着几分兴奋，显得颇为滑稽。她厉声回答：“你姐姐。”

“你？”美格喊道，把手头的活计扔到一边。

“写得蛮不错的。”艾美评论说。

“我早就知道！我早就知道！哦，我的乔，我太自豪了！”贝丝抱住姐姐，为这次巨大的成功而欢呼。

天哪，她们是多么开心，真的！美格怎么都不敢相信，直到她看到“约瑟芬·马奇小姐”这几个字明明白白地印在报纸上。艾美宽容地评论着故事中绘画的部分，又提供了一些写续集的线索。不幸的是，事情已经不可能了，因为男女主人公都已经毙命了。贝丝是多么激动，高兴得又唱又跳。汉娜得知是“乔的东西”，十分惊讶，进来就喊：“莎士[3]转世！想都没想到！”马奇太太得知此事，也是非常自豪。乔笑得多么开心，眼中噙满泪水。这时，她宣布，自己够风光的了，就算死了也值得。报纸在大家手里传来传去，这份“展翅的雄鹰”仿佛真的在马奇府的上空展翅翱翔。

“跟我们说说。”“什么时候出的？”“你拿了多少稿费？”“爸爸知道了会怎么说？”“劳里会不会笑话？”全家人围在乔身边，七嘴八舌。每每家庭有一点点开心的事，这不识时务、感情外露的一家人都会狂欢一番。

“别再唧唧喳喳了，姐妹们，我把什么都告诉你们吧。”乔说。她为自己的《画王争霸》备感得意，心里还纳闷，伯尼[4]小姐对她的《埃维莉娜》是不是感到更光荣一些。讲述了两篇小说投稿的经过后，乔补充说：“我去听回音的时候，那个男的说，两篇他都喜欢，可他不给初学写作的人付稿费，只是登出来，再加些简评。他说，这是一种有益的做法，等到作者水平提高了，自然大家愿意付稿费。于是，我就把小说都交给了他，这篇是今天刚寄来的，被劳里看到了。他一定要看，我就给他看了。他说写得不错，应该再写一些，由他去安排下次的稿费。我很高兴，很快我就可以自食其力，还可以帮你们一把呢。”

说到这里，乔缓不过气来了。她把头埋在报纸里，洒下几滴油然而生的眼泪，沾湿了这篇小说。自力更生、赢得亲人的赞扬是她心底最大的愿望。通过这次成功，乔似乎迈出了通向那个幸福目标的第一步。

第十五章　电报


“一年中十一月最讨厌的了。”一个阴沉的下午，美格站在窗口，望着窗外霜冻萧瑟的园子说。

“所以我是这个月生的。”乔闷闷不乐地说，连鼻子沾上了墨水都没注意到。

“要是现在有好事的话，我们还是觉得这个月不错的。”贝丝说。她对什么都充满希望，甚至对十一月也是如此。

“大概吧，但这个家从来都没有什么好事。”心情不好的美格说，“我们日复一日地苦干，没有一点起色，有趣的事情还是没有。跟驴子拉磨差不多嘛。”

“哎哟，我们真是忧郁啊！”乔喊道，“乖乖，我倒不怎么奇怪，因为你看到别的姑娘们风光快乐，自己却一年到头拉磨，苦干噢。但愿能为你安排命运，就像我为笔下的女主人公所做的那样！你长得美，而且已经学好了，我要安排某个阔亲戚出人意料地给你留下一笔财产，于是你成了富二代，出人头地，对曾经小看你的人嗤之以鼻，漂洋过海，最后成了贵夫人，衣锦还乡，轰轰烈烈的。”

“这种留遗产的办法，如今是不会再有的了。男人得工作得好，女人得嫁得好，才能有钱。这个可怕的世界真不公平。”美格愤世嫉俗地说。

“我和乔将要为大家赚大钱，等上十年吧，我们不发财才怪呢。”艾美说。她正坐在一角做泥饼——汉娜就这样称呼她那些小鸟、水果、脸谱等小陶件的。

“等不得了，恐怕我对笔墨和泥土也没什么信心，虽然我很领情的。”

美格叹了口气，又回头转向花木凋零的园子。乔抱怨着，沮丧地把双肘靠在桌子上。可艾美在一个劲地拍泥巴，贝丝坐在外边窗口，笑着说：“马上就双喜临门了。妈咪到街口了，劳里穿过园子了，好像他有什么好消息。”

他们俩一起进来了，马奇太太跟往常一样问道：“女儿们，有爸爸的信吗？”劳里则令人盛情难却地说：“有谁想去乘车兜风？一直做数学，头都昏掉了。我想去飙车一圈，清醒一下脑子。虽然是阴天，可空气不错。我要去接布鲁克回家，要是外边没劲，车厢里边会很快乐的。来吧，乔，你和贝丝会去，是吧？”

“我们当然去。”

“非常感谢，可我正忙着呢。”美格赶紧取出针线篮。她答应过母亲，最好别和这位年轻人三天两头出去乘车，至少她应该这样。

“我们三个马上就好。”艾美一边喊着，一边跑去洗手。

“我可以为您做点什么，母亲大人？”劳里问。他靠在马奇太太的椅背上，眼光和语气里都充满了深情，他对马奇太太一向如此。

“不用了，谢谢。不过，孩子，也许得麻烦你去趟邮局。今天应该有信，可邮递员还没来过。爸爸历来准时，可能是路上耽搁了。”

刺耳的铃声打断了她。过了片刻，汉娜拿着一封信走了进来。

“是一封可怕的电报，太太。”她说着递了过去，似乎怕它爆炸伤人。

一听是电报，马奇太太一把夺过去。读了仅有的几个字，她一下就瘫倒在椅子上，面容苍白，仿佛这张小纸片把一颗子弹射进了她的心脏。劳里冲下楼去取水，美格和汉娜立刻搀住她，乔胆战心惊地大声念道：





马奇太太：

你夫病重，速来。

华盛顿布兰克医院

S．黑尔





她们都屏住呼吸听着，屋子里静悄悄的。很奇怪，外面的天都暗了下来，整个世界好像发生了变故。姑娘们聚集在母亲身边，只觉得生活的一切幸福和支柱一下子都要被夺走。不久，马奇太太回过神来，重新把电报读了一遍，然后向女儿们伸出双臂说：“我马上就走，可能已经晚了。噢，孩子们，孩子们，要帮我一起挺住啊！”说话的口气令她们永生难忘。

好几分钟，房间里只能听到哭泣声，夹杂着断断续续的安慰声和轻轻的劝解声，但亲切的展望往往以泣不成声告终。可怜的汉娜最先从痛苦中挣扎出来，不经意间，她的见识为大家树立了榜样。在她看来，工作就是治疗各种痛苦的良药。

“愿上帝保佑好人！不能只顾着哭，我要马上把你的东西收拾好，太太。”她真诚地说，一边用围裙擦脸，一边用她那粗糙的手与女主人热情地握了一下，走开了，接着以一个顶仨的干劲投入了工作。

“汉娜说得对，现在没工夫哭。静下来，孩子们，让我想一下。”

可怜的姑娘们勉强镇定下来。这时母亲坐起来，脸色惨白，但显得很冷静，她强压着内心的痛苦，考虑着她们该怎么办。

“劳里在哪里？”她问。她理清了思绪，决定了首先要做的几件事。

“在，太太。哦，让我做点什么吧！”男孩大声应答。他觉得最初的悲伤太神圣了，连他友好的眼睛也看不得，所以刚才退到了隔壁房间，现在又急匆匆地过来。

“去发封电报，说我马上就来。下一班火车凌晨开，就乘那班车。”

“还有吗？马都备好了，我哪儿都能去，干什么都行。”他说。看来他已经准备飞到天边了。

“给马奇姑婆家送封信。乔，给我纸笔。”

乔从自己新抄好的稿纸上撕下一张反面空白的，把桌子拉到母亲跟前。她心里很清楚，为了这次伤心的长途旅行，还得去求借。只要能为爸爸筹钱，哪怕只是一点点，她做什么都心甘情愿。

“现在就去，乖乖。别拼命赶，伤了自己，犯不着的。”

显然，马奇太太的告诫被抛到了脑后。五分钟后，劳里骑快马逃命似的从窗前飞奔而过。

“乔，快到收容所去一趟，告诉金太太我不去了。顺路把这些东西买来，我马上写下来，到时候会有用的。去之前，我先得做好护理的准备。医院的商店有时并不好。贝丝，去跟劳伦斯先生要两瓶陈年葡萄酒。为了爸爸，我只能求人，面子也顾不得了，他该喝最好的东西。艾美，让汉娜把黑箱子拿下来。美格，来帮我找东西，我脑子都昏了。

既要写，又要思考，还要指挥一切，一下把这位可怜的太太搅得头昏脑涨。美格恳求她在房间里静静地坐上片刻，一切工作由她们来做。大家奔东跑西，就像被一阵风吹散了的树叶。这封电报就像一道恶咒，一下子把宁静幸福的家庭搅得支离破碎。

劳伦斯先生跟着贝丝匆匆赶回来，热心的老先生把能想到的让病人享福的东西都带来了。他还客气地答应，在母亲不在的时候照看姑娘们，这使马奇太太备感安慰。他把一切都拿出来了，包括自己的罩衣，甚至提出要亲自护送她去。不过后者是不可能的。马奇太太不愿让老先生长途奔波劳累。然而，当他提及此事时，马奇太太欣慰的神情跃然脸上，毕竟心急如焚地出门是不妥当的。劳伦斯先生注意到她脸上的神情，紧皱浓眉，搓搓手，突然起身离开，说马上就回来。大家没有时间去想他了。这时美格跑进门来，一只手拎着一双胶鞋，另一只手端着一杯茶，却正好碰见布鲁克先生。

“马奇小姐，听到消息我很难过。”他平和善意地说，使她不安的心感到十分温暖，“我是来护送你妈妈的。劳伦斯先生派我去华盛顿办点事，我真的很高兴能去帮忙。”

美格伸出手，胶鞋一下子掉到了地上，茶也差一点倒了，她脸上充满了感激之情。这使布鲁克先生觉得，做出再大的牺牲都值得，何况这次只需稍微花点时间照顾马奇太太。

“你们真是太好了！妈妈会愿意的，我敢肯定。有人照顾她，我们也就放心了。真的感激不尽！”

美格说得很真挚，进入了忘我的境界。直到一双棕色眼睛的放射出一种光芒，才使她想起茶快凉了。她赶忙带头走进客厅，说是去告诉妈妈。

等到劳里回来的时候，一切都已安排妥当。他带回来马奇姑婆的一封短信，还有急需的钱，信里寥寥数行，重复了她的老生常谈——她老是跟他们说，马奇先生去参军真是荒唐，早料到这不会有好结果，希望下次他们会听话。马奇太太把纸条扔进炉火，把钱塞进钱包。她紧咬双唇，继续做准备工作。要是乔在场的话，她能领会其中的道理。

短暂的下午一晃就过去了，其他需要奔走的一切都办妥了，美格和母亲正在忙着做一些必要的针线活，贝丝和艾美在弄茶，汉娜噼里啪啦地烫好衣服，只有乔还没回来。大家开始担心起来，劳里出去找她了，因为没人知道乔脑子里会有什么古怪的念头。他没找到乔，可她倒回来了，古怪的神色里夹杂着几分滑稽和担心，满意和遗憾，大家见了都感到疑惑不解。她把一卷钱放在母亲面前说：“这是我给爸爸的，希望他过得舒服点，早点回来！”声音里带着几分哽咽。

“乖乖，哪来的？二十五元！乔，你没干傻事吧？”

“没有，这是我光明正大所得的。没讨、没借、没偷。我挣的。我想你不会骂我的，我只是把自己的东西卖了。”

说着，乔摘下帽子，大家都惊叫一声，她满头长发剪短了。

“你的头发！漂亮的头发！”“噢，乔，怎么能这样？这可是你的一个亮点。”“我的宝贝，用不着这样的。”“她不像我的乔了，可我会深爱她的！”

在大家的喊声中，贝丝把剪成平头的脑袋深情地搂在怀里。乔装出一副满不在乎的神态，却一点也骗不过大家。她抚弄一下褐色的短发，尽力表示自己喜欢这种发式，说：“又不会影响国家的命运，别这么号啕大哭了，贝丝。这正好可以治治我的虚荣心，我对秀发越来越自鸣得意了。现在除掉这头乱发，可以健脑益智，我的脑袋变得又轻便又冷静。理发师说，短发很快就可以卷曲起来，这样就像男孩子，好看，又容易梳理。我很满意，收起钞票，开饭吧。”

“把事情经过告诉我，乔。我并不是十分满意，但不能责怪你，我知道你是心甘情愿为自己的爱牺牲你所谓的虚荣心。不过，乖乖，没必要这样，我怕你过两天反悔呢。”马奇太太说。

“不会的！”乔坚定地回答。这次胡闹没有遭到严厉谴责，她心里轻松多了。

“是什么促使你这样做的？”艾美问。对于她来说，剪掉一头秀发还不如砍掉她的脑袋呢。

“嗯，我拼命想为爸爸做点事。”乔回答。这时，大家已经围在桌边，年轻人身体健康，即便心里烦恼也照样能吃。“我像妈妈一样讨厌借钱，我知道马奇姑婆又要叽里咕噜了，她向来就是这样，只要你向她借上九便士硬币。美格把季度的薪水全交了房租，我的却只用来买了衣服，我觉得自己很坏，决心无论如何要筹点钱，哪怕是卖掉自己脸上的鼻子。”

“不必觉得自己很坏，孩子。你没有冬衣，用自己辛苦赚来的钱，买了几件最朴素不过的衣服而已。”马奇太太说着看了乔一眼，一股暖流淌进女儿的心田。

“开始我一点儿也没想到要卖头发，后来我边走边盘算自己能做点什么，真想蹿进富丽堂皇的商店里随便拿。我看到理发店的橱窗摆了几个发辫，都标了价，一个黑色发辫，还不及我的粗，标价四十元。我突然想到，有一样东西可以换钱，于是我顾不上多想便走了进去，问他们要不要头发，我的头发他们给多少钱。”

“我不明白你怎么这样勇敢。”贝丝肃然起敬。

“哦。老板是个小个子，看他的样子，似乎活着就是为了给他的头发上油。他一开始有点目瞪口呆，看来不习惯女孩子闯进店子里叫他买头发。他说对我的头发不喜欢，颜色并不时髦，况且原本就不会出多少价的。头发要经过加工才值钱，等等。天色已晚，我担心如果不马上做成这桩买卖，那就根本做不成了，你们也知道我做事不喜欢半途而废。于是我求他把头发买下，并告诉他为何这样着急。这样做当然很傻，但他听后改变了主意，因为我当时很激动，话说得颠三倒四。他妻子听到了，善意地说：‘买下吧，托马斯，成全这位小姐吧，如果我有一把值钱的头发，我也会为我们的吉米这样做的。'”

“吉米是谁？”逢事喜欢让人解释的艾美问道。

“她的儿子，她说也在军队里头。这种事情使陌生人一见如故，可不是吗？那男人帮我剪发时，她一路跟我拉话儿，分散我的注意力。”

“一刀剪下去的时候你有没有觉得不寒而栗？”美格打了个寒战问。

“趁那男人操家伙的当儿，我看了自己的头发最后一眼，仅此而已。我从不为这种小事哭鼻子。不过我承认，看到自己的宝贝头发摆在桌上，摸摸脑袋只剩下又短又粗的发茬时，心里怪怪的。这种滋味简直有点像掉胳膊断腿。那女人看到我盯着头发，便捡起一绺长发给我保存。现在把它交给您，妈咪，以此纪念昔日的光彩，短发舒服极了，我想以后再也不会留长发了。”

马奇太太把波浪形的栗色鬈发绺折起来，和一绺灰白色的短发一起放在她的桌子里头，只说了一句：“难为你了，宝贝。”但她脸上的神色使姑娘们换了个话题。她们强打精神，谈论布鲁克先生是怎样一个好人，又说明天一定天气晴朗，爸爸回来养病的时候，大家就可以共享天伦之乐了。

十点了，大家都毫无睡意，马奇太太把最后完工的活计搁在一边说：“来吧，姑娘们。”贝丝走到钢琴前，弹了一曲父亲最喜欢的赞美诗，大家都鼓足勇气唱了起来，然后个个悲伤得难以为继，最后只有贝丝还在满怀深情地唱，因为对她来说，悦耳的音乐总能抚平心灵的创伤。

“去睡吧，别再讲话了。我们明天还要起早，可还是要睡足。晚安，宝贝们。”马奇太太说。这时圣歌结束了，没人再想唱一首。

她们默默地吻别母亲，然后悄悄地上床睡觉，仿佛病重的父亲就躺在隔壁。尽管遭此大难，艾美和贝丝还是很快就入睡了。美格睡不着，幼小的心灵第一次作严肃的思考。乔一动不动地躺着，姐姐以为她早已入睡，却听到了憋着的哽咽声，还摸到了湿润的脸颊，她惊叫一声：

“乔，乖乖，怎么了？你在为爸爸伤心吗？”

“不，现在不是。”

“那你干吗哭呢？”

“为我——我的头发！”可怜的乔终于放声哭出来了，她本来想用枕头遮掩感情的流露，可没用。

美格听了一点都不觉得好笑，她柔情似海地亲吻着、抚摸着这位受伤的英雄。

“我不后悔。”乔哽咽了一下，辩解道，“要是可能，明天还会这么做的。只是内心虚荣、自私的一面，才会这么傻哭。不要跟别人说，现在没事了。我还以为你睡着了，只想为我的亮点哭两声，并不想让人知道。你怎么也没睡？”

“睡不着，心里很焦急。”美格说。

“想想愉快的事情，就会很快睡着了。”

“试过了，但反而更清醒。”

“你在想什么？”

“英俊的脸孔——特别是眼睛。”美格答道，黑暗中自个微笑起来。

“你最喜欢什么颜色？”

“棕色——有时候喜欢，不过蓝色也很漂亮。”

乔笑了，美格严令她不许再说，接着又笑着答应替她把头发烫弯，随后便酣然入睡，梦里住进她的空中楼阁去了。

午夜的钟声敲响了，房间里一片寂静。只有一个身影悄悄地从一张床走到另一张床，把这边的被单拉直，把那边的枕头塞好，又久久站立，满怀深情地注视着每一张熟睡的脸，轻轻地吻她们，用母亲独有的热情为她们默默祈祷。她撩起窗帘，望着外面沉闷的黑夜，只见月亮突然破云而出，宛如一张明亮和蔼的脸照着她，它在寂静中好像悄悄地在说：“别急，乖乖！乌云是遮不住光明的。”





第十六章　信件


阴冷的清晨，天蒙蒙亮，姐妹们点亮了灯，认真地读起了她们的章节，她们可从来都没有这么虔诚过。既然困难真的已经降临了，小书里就充满了帮助和安慰。她们穿衣服的时候商定，与母亲道别的时候，要高兴、满怀希望，不落泪，不抱怨，让她开心地踏上艰难的旅途。她们下了楼，只觉得一切都很陌生——外面漆黑一片，无声无息，里面灯火通明，热闹非凡。凌晨吃早餐有点怪，汉娜头戴睡帽在厨房里忙碌着，连她那熟悉的脸也显得相当陌生。过道里放着大箱子，沙发上放着母亲的风衣和帽子。母亲独自坐着，努力吃着东西，但一夜没合眼，加上忧心忡忡，她脸色苍白，显得疲惫不堪。这时姑娘们觉得很难执行先前做出的决定。美格极力控制自己，可还是泪眼汪汪，乔好几次都忍不住用厨房的毛巾抹眼泪。两个妹妹神色黯然、痛苦不堪，仿佛她们从没体验过悲痛。

谁都没有多说话。她们坐着等马车，等待着离别时刻的到来。姑娘们在为母亲忙这忙那，一个为她折围巾，另一个为她把帽带拉直，还有一个帮她穿套鞋，再有一个替她系好旅行包。这时，马奇太太对女儿们说：

“孩子们，我把你们托付给汉娜和劳伦斯先生照顾。汉娜向来忠诚，我们的好邻居也会像守护自己的孩子一样保护你们。我很放心，可我担心的是，你们要正确面对这次困难。我不在的时候不要伤心，不要烦躁，也不要以为你们只要偷闲，把它忘了，就可以舒服了。还是要照常工作，工作是天赐的、最好的安慰。满怀希望，不要偷闲，不管发生什么，都要记住，你们永远都不会没有爸爸。”

“好的，妈妈。”

“美格，乖乖，谨慎一点，照顾好妹妹，有事问问汉娜，有什么麻烦，去找劳伦斯先生。乔，耐心一点，别灰心，别做傻事，记得常给我写信，勇敢起来，多帮帮别人，多鼓励大家。贝丝，别忘了练琴安慰自己，帮家里做点小事。还有你艾美，尽量多帮帮家里，听话，开心地待在家里，不要闯祸。”

“会的，妈妈！我们会的！”

吱吱嘎嘎的马车声由远而近，她们都站起来倾听。那是痛苦的时刻，可姑娘们挺住了，没人哭，也没人逃避，发出悲叹。她们怀着沉重的心情，让母亲把深情的祝福带给父亲。她们嘴上说着，可心里明白，可能已经太迟了。她们默默地亲吻母亲，深情地依偎在母亲周围。望着母亲乘车远去的身影，她们强作欢颜，与她挥手道别。

劳里和爷爷也来送行，布鲁克先生显得精神饱满、明达事理、和蔼可亲，姑娘们当场就送他一个雅号：“高尚先生”。

“再见，我的宝贝！愿上帝保佑我们平安！”马奇太太轻声说道。她在一张张可爱的小脸蛋上都吻了一下，然后匆匆地上了马车。

母亲渐渐远去，太阳冉冉升起。马奇太太回头望去，只见众人站在大门口，太阳照在她们身上，又是个好兆头。她们也看到了太阳，面带微笑地挥着手。马车转弯时，她最后瞥到了四张开心的面孔，她们身后站着劳伦斯先生，俨然一个保镖，还有忠实的汉娜和忠诚的劳里。

“大家对我们真是太好了！”她说着转过头去，见到年轻人脸上尊重和同情的表情，她心中更有体会。

“看不出他们怎么可能不这么做。”布鲁克先生说。他笑得很有感染力，马奇太太也忍不住笑了起来。就这样，漫长的旅途在灿烂阳光和欢声笑语的好兆头中开始了。

“我觉得好像发生了地震。”乔说。邻居回家吃早餐去了，让她们也休息一下。

“好像房子都倒了一半。”接着美格愁眉苦脸地说。

贝丝开口想说话，可只是用手指着母亲桌上一堆补好的袜子。这表明，即使在匆忙的最后时刻，她还是替她们着想，为她们忙碌。虽然只是小事一桩，可深深地触动了她们的心。她们不顾先前的勇敢决定，都忍不住失声痛哭起来。

汉娜很明智，由她们宣泄，等到阵雨有渐止的迹象，她才端着咖啡壶来救场。

“好了，乖小姐们，别忘了妈妈说的话，不要烦躁。来，喝杯咖啡，喝完了就开始工作，为这个家添砖加瓦。”

喝咖啡是高级待遇，再说那天早上汉娜心灵手巧，把咖啡煮得很香。她不断点头相劝，咖啡壶嘴里冒出来的阵阵香气也令人欲罢不能。姐妹们凑到饭桌边，把手帕换作餐巾，十分钟便都恢复了常态。

“‘满怀希望，不要偷闲。’这是我们的座右铭，看谁最能记住。我要照常上马奇姑婆那儿去。唉，但愿她不要训话了！”乔呷着咖啡，便来了精神。

“我也要上金家去，不过我倒宁愿待在家里做家务。”美格说道，后悔自己把眼睛哭红了。

“不必啦。我和贝丝可以把家理得头头是道的。”艾美郑重其事地插嘴说。

贝丝赶紧拿出拖把和洗碗盆子说：“汉娜会教我们做的，你们回来的时候，我们会把一切都备得好好的。”

“我觉得焦虑情绪挺有趣儿。”艾美边嚼砂糖，边沉思地说。

大家全忍不住笑起来，心里也好受多了。美格则对这位可以在糖缸里找安慰的小姐摇摇头。

看到酥饼，乔严肃起来。姐妹俩出门去上班，凄惨地不断回头向窗口望去，平时母亲一定在的，此时却空空如也。不过，贝丝却没有忘记这个小小的家庭仪式，她站在窗前，向两位姐姐点头致意，像个穿唐装的红脸摆头娃娃。

“真是我的好贝丝！”乔说着挥挥帽子，露出一脸感激之情，“再见，美格，希望金家兄弟今天不会折腾你。别担忧爸爸，乖乖。”临分手时她又说。

“我也希望马奇姑婆不会唠唠叨叨，你的头发很好看，像个小伙子。”美格回答。妹妹的脑袋披着短短的鬈发，衬在高高的身架上，显得又小又滑稽，美格极力忍着不去笑她。

“这是我唯一的安慰。”乔摸摸劳里送她的大帽子，转身而去，觉得自己就像寒风中剪了毛的绵羊。

父亲的消息传来，使姑娘们颇感欣慰。虽然他病得很严重，但在护士体贴而精心的照顾下，病情已有起色。布鲁克先生每天都寄来一张病情报告。作为一家之长，美格坚持由她来读这些快信。随着时间推移，消息也变得越来越令人高兴。起先，谁都急着要写信，写好后由一个人把鼓鼓的信封小心翼翼地投进信箱。她们都因华盛顿信使的任务而拥“信”自重。有一封信很具代表性，我们不妨截下几封来读一读：





亲爱的妈妈：

读了来信，我们的喜悦心情简直难以言表，大好消息令我们高兴得又笑又哭。布鲁克先生真是好人，事情真巧，为了劳伦斯先生的生意，他能留在你们身边陪伴这么久，对你和爸来说那么有用。妹妹们个个很听话。乔帮我干针线活，还坚持做各种难做的工作。幸亏我知道她的“道德冲动”长不了，才不至于担心她劳累过度。贝丝按部就班，尽忠职守，从不忘记您告诉她的话。她为爸爸难过，只有在弹小钢琴时才能控制自己的重重心事。艾美很听我的话，我也十分细心地照顾她。她自己梳头，我正教她开纽孔，补袜子。她干得很卖力，您回家一定会对她的进步感到满意。劳伦斯先生像老母鸡一样照看我们——这是乔说的话，劳里待我们也十分热情友好。你们远在外地，我们有时闷闷不乐，觉得自己像个孤儿，是劳里和乔使我们快乐起来。汉娜是个大圣人，她从不骂人，总是称我为“玛格丽特小姐”，待我十分尊重。您知道，这称呼十分体面的。而且我们人人安好，个个忙碌，只是日夜盼望你们回来。请转达我对爸爸最诚挚的爱。相信我吧。

永远属于您的美格





和这张字迹秀丽的香笺形成鲜明对照的，是下面这张潦潦草草地写在进口薄信纸上、墨迹斑斑、龙飞凤舞的大纸条：





最亲爱的妈咪：

为亲爱的爸爸欢呼三声！布鲁克一见爸爸身体好转，便飞速电告我们，真是好人。收到信时我冲上阁楼，试图感谢上帝对我们的厚爱，却只哭着说：“我好高兴！我好高兴！”这不也跟真正的祈祷一样管用吗？我心中百感交集。我们日子过得很有趣味，我已经开始享受这种生活，大家互相体谅，家里就像一个无比温暖的斑鸠巢。若您看到美格坐在首席，努力做个好妈妈，一定会笑出来的。她越来越漂亮了，有时候我竟爱上她了。两个小妹妹是名副其实的天使长，我呢——嗯，我是乔，不会变的。哦，我得告诉您，我差点和劳里吵了一架。我对一桩小事畅所欲言，他便动气了。我并没有错，只是说话方式不对，他便径直走回家，说我不道歉就不会再来。我宣布不会道歉，十分恼火。事情整整一天都僵着。我心里不好受，十分想念您。我和劳里自尊心都特强，很难放下面子道歉，但我以为他会回心转意的，因为我有理。他没有来，晚上我想起艾美掉进河那次您跟我说的话，又读了我的小册子，心里好受了一点，决定不能因一时愤怒而看不见阳光，于是便跑过去向劳里道歉。谁知就在门口遇到了他，也是跑来向我道歉的。我们都大笑，互相说了对不起，又和好如初了。

昨天我帮汉娜洗衣服时，胡诌了一首侍（诗）；爸爸喜欢我这些小玩意，现寄上博他一笑。紧紧拥抱爸爸，也代我好好亲亲您自己。





您的混乱大王乔

肥皂泡之歌

洗衣盆女神哟，我欢歌一曲；

看那白泡泡泛起，

我使劲又洗又漂，

拧干的衣服晾起来，

在悠悠清风中晃荡，

天上阳光灿烂。





我祝愿能把一周的污渍，

从我们的心灵洗去。

让水和清风施展魔法，

把我们洗得一样纯净。

使地球上真有一个

灿烂辉煌的洗涤日！





在有益的生活道路上，

愿内心平静，如花永不凋谢；

忙碌的脑袋来不及顾及

悲伤、烦恼和忧郁。

我们勇敢地挥动扫帚，

焦虑的念头一扫光。





我高高兴兴地肩负

每天的劳动任务；

使我身体强健，充满希望。

我快乐地学会说——

“头脑可以思考，心灵可以感觉，

但手，必须永远工作！”





亲爱的妈妈：

信封空间有限，只够我送上我的挚爱，送上我一直保养在屋里留待爸爸观赏的三色堇干花。我每天早上读书，白天努力学好，晚间哼着爸爸的曲子入睡。我现在不能唱《天国之歌》，那使我哭泣。大家都和善，没有你们的日子过得还愉快。艾美要我把下面的空白留给她，得搁笔了。我没有忘记盖好布衬垫，每天都给房间通风，给时钟上发条。

亲亲爸爸的脸颊。他说这是我的脸颊。噢，务必赶快回到我的身边。

你疼爱的小贝丝





Ma Chère Mamma[1]：

我们都很好我总做功课从不和姐姐们强挑（调）——美格说我的意思是驳策（斥）所以我把两个词都写上等你来挑。美格待我棒极每晚吃茶点都让我吃果冻乔说这东西对我很有好处使我脾气甜美。劳里对人不够尊重现在我已差不多十几岁了，他还管我叫黄毛丫头当我像海蒂·金一样说Merci[2]或者Bon jour[3]的时候他就说很快的法语来伤我心。我那条蓝套裙的袖子全磨破了，美格换了一对新的，但前面换错了颜色变得比裙子还要蓝。我心里不好受但没有恼火忍受着困难我真希望汉娜把我的围裙浆硬一点并每天做荞麦。她不可以吗？我的问号画得够漂亮吧？美格说我的标点付（符）号和拚（拼）写很不雅我很感屈如（辱），但是哎呀我有这么多事情要做，不能停下。再会，给爸爸送上大堆的爱。

深深爱您的女儿

艾美·科蒂斯·马奇





亲爱的马奇太太：

我只写几子（字）告诉你我们过得丁（顶）好。姑娘们又聪明又勤快。美格小姐就能成为很好的管家；她对这有心（兴）趣，飞快掌握里头的七（窍）门儿。乔死（事）死（事）都带头，但不会死（事）先盘算。永不知她下一步出什么花样。她礼拜一洗了一桶衣服，还没绞干就上了浆，还把一条粉红色的印花裙儿弄成蓝色，我差一点笑死了。小家伙贝丝最乖，又做家务又可靠，是我的好帮手。她什么都努力去学，小小年纪就上街买菜了，还在我的指点下记账，很神呢。我们一直都节省，按照您的意思，每礼拜只让姑娘们喝一次咖啡，给她们吃简单又健康的主食。艾美有好衣服穿，有甜品吃，也不发牢骚了。劳里先生还是那么折腾，常把屋子弄得天翻地覆，不过他能使姑娘们振作，所以任他们胡闹去。那位老先生送来大堆东西，简直让人烦了，不过出于好心，我做下人的也不该说三道四。面包发起来了，这次不多说了。向马奇先生致敬，祝愿他不再得肺炎。

汉娜·莫莱特敬上





第二号病房护士长：

拉帕汉诺克河边营地一片静谧，部队状态良好，军需部运转正常，特迪上校手下的地方卫队一直忠于职守，总司令劳伦斯将军每天巡视部队，军需官莫莱特掌管营中秩序，赖昂少校专司晚间巡哨。收到华盛顿方面的佳讯后，我军鸣枪二十四响致敬，并于总部举行阅兵典礼。总司令致以美好祝愿。

特迪上校同祝





尊敬的女士：

小姑娘个个安好。贝丝和孙儿天天汇报。汉娜是模范仆人，像龙一样保护美丽的美格。所幸天气一直晴好。请尽管使唤布鲁克，经费超出估算请向我报销。别让尊夫短缺什么。感谢上帝，他正在康复。

您诚挚的朋友和仆人

詹姆士·劳伦斯

第十七章　小姑娘讲信用


整整一个礼拜，旧房子里洋溢着的美德，足以使街坊们移风易俗。大家思想境界就像在天堂，忘我之风盛行，真是惊世骇俗。起先，她们为父亲担心，可现在这种担心已有所缓解，不知不觉中，姑娘们放松了这种值得称道的努力，又开始故态复萌。当然，她们没有忘记自己的座右铭，不过，满怀希望、不要偷闲显得越来越容易办到。在付出种种艰苦努力之后，她们觉得“奋进”赢得了假期，于是乎大休特休了。

乔因疏忽大意，没有裹好剪了头发的脑袋，得了重感冒，奉命待在家里养病，马奇姑婆不喜欢听伤风的人朗读。这正中乔的下怀，她起劲地翻箱倒柜，从阁楼搜罗到地窖，然后埋到沙发里服砷剂，看闲书，慢慢养起病来。艾美发现家务和艺术不能兼顾，便又重新操起了她的泥饼。美格天天去教学生，在家时便做些针线活，或自以为是在做，而更多的时候是给妈妈写长信，反复细读华盛顿的快信。只有贝丝坚持不懈，极少偷闲或悲泣。

贝丝每天都忠实地做好一切琐碎的家务。姐妹们都健忘，再加上屋子里就像座钟丢了摆，她便把许多属于她们的工作也揽了过来。每当思念母亲远离、担心父亲病情，心情沉重的时候，她就躲进一个衣柜里，把脸埋在亲切的旧衣服里，悄悄呜咽一阵，轻声祷告几句。没有人知道，是什么力量使她在一阵哭泣之后重新开心起来，但大家都分明感觉到，她是多么的和善、乐于助人，于是每逢遇上一丁点儿的小问题，大家都喜欢找她排解、出主意。

谁都没想到，这次经历是对品格的一次考验。等最初的躁动过去，她们觉得自己干得很出色，值得赞扬。她们也确实干得不错，可错误在于没有坚持下去。于是，她们陷入了焦虑、后悔，这才从中得到了教训。

“美格，希望你去胡梅尔家看看吧。妈妈说过的，叫我们别忘记了她们。”马奇太太走后的第十天，贝丝说。

“今天下午太累了，我可不去的。”美格说着，舒服地在摇椅上边摇边做针线活。

“乔，你能去吗？”贝丝问。

“外面风太大，我感冒还没好呢。”

“我以为差不多好了呢。”

“要是跟劳里出去嘛，够好了，可去胡梅尔家呢，就没好。”乔边说边笑，为自己前后矛盾的话显得有点惭愧。

“你自己干吗不去呀？”美格问。

“我每天都去的呀，可那婴儿病了，我不知道该怎么解决的。胡梅尔太太上班去了，姐姐若存在照看着，可病情越来越厉害，我看还是去一趟吧，你不去，那就叫汉娜去。”

贝丝正经地说，可美格只答应第二天才去。

“贝丝，跟汉娜要些好吃的，拿去就行了。出去透透气，对你有好处的。”乔说。接着她又辩解道：“我会去的，可手头的东西先得写完嘛。”

“我头痛，人又很累，本来以为你们有人会去的呢。”贝丝说。

“艾美马上就回来了，她会替我们跑一趟的呀。”美格提议。

“好吧，我歇会儿，等等她。”

说完贝丝在沙发上躺下来，另外两位则继续工作，把胡梅尔家的事忘得一干二净。一个小时过去了，艾美还没回来。美格到房间试新衣服去了，乔埋头写她的小说，汉娜在灶火前睡得正香。贝丝默默地拉上帽子，在篮子里放满了零碎东西，给穷孩子们带去，然后扛着个沉重的脑袋，冒着刺骨的寒风出了家门，坚韧的双眼流露出一丝伤感。她回来的时候，天色已晚，没人看到她爬上楼梯，把自己锁在母亲的房间里。半小时后，乔去妈妈的小室拿东西，才发现小贝丝坐在药箱上，两眼通红，神情黯然，手里拿着个樟脑瓶。

“上帝呀！出什么事了？”乔喊道。这时贝丝伸手，似乎警告她别靠近，并迅速问道：

“你得过猩红热的，是吗？”

“几年前和美格一起得的，怎么啦？”

“那我就跟你说。乔噢，那婴儿死了！”

“哪个婴儿？”

“胡梅尔太太的那个。她还没到家，小孩就死在我的怀里。”贝丝抽泣着大声道。

“可怜的宝贝。这对你真是太可怕了！应该我去的嘛。”乔说着抱了妹妹坐在母亲的大椅子上，满脸悔恨。

“没什么好怕的，只是很惨哟，一眼就看得出来，婴儿病得更厉害了，可若存说妈妈已经去找医生了。于是我抱着小孩，好让若存歇一会儿。他看上去好像睡着了，突然哭了一声，抖了一下，然后就躺着不动了。我想给他暖暖脚，若存给他喝牛奶，可他一动都不动，我就知道他死了。”

“别哭，乖乖！那你怎么办了呢？”

“我只是坐着轻轻地抱着他，等到胡梅尔太太带医生赶来。医生说没救了。海因里希和明娜也喉咙痛了，医生看了看说：‘猩红热，太太。早就该找我了。’他很生气。胡梅尔太太说没钱，一直是自己想办法给婴儿治病，可现在太晚了。她只能求他救救其他的孩子，相信慈善机构会付钱给他。他笑了笑，变得热情多了。可婴儿很惨，我和他们一起哭。他突然转过身来，叫我马上回家服颠茄，要不然我也会得猩红热的。”

“不，不会的！”乔喊道，惊恐地搂紧她，“噢，贝丝，要是你病了，我永远都不会原谅自己的！我们该怎么办哪？”

“别害怕，我想不会这么严重。我查过妈妈的书，知道起先是头疼、喉咙痛，感觉不舒服，就像我这样，所以我服了一点颠茄，现在感觉好多了。”贝丝说着把冰冷的双手摁到滚烫的额头上，尽量使脸色显得好看些。

“要是妈妈在家就好了！”乔喊道。一把拿过那本书，心里觉得华盛顿太遥远了。她读了一页，看了一眼贝丝，摸了摸贝丝的头，瞧了瞧喉咙，然后严肃地说：“你一个多礼拜都在照看婴儿哟，还跟其他孩子待在一起。要知道，他们都是要得病的人。恐怕你也要得猩红热啦。我去叫汉娜，她什么病都知道的。”

“别让艾美来，她可没得过的，不想把病传给她。你和美格不会再得了吗？”贝丝忧虑地问。

“我想不会，即使我得了也没啥，我活该。让你去，我自己却待在家里写废话，我真是头自私的猪！”乔喃喃地说。随后，她过去请问汉娜。

好心人一听马上睡意全无，立刻带头赶了过来。她安慰乔不用着急，谁都会得猩红热，医治得当就不会死人——所有这一切，乔都相信，心里感到轻松多了。两人上楼去叫美格。

“现在，告诉你们该怎么办。”汉娜说。她已经替贝丝检查，盘问完毕了。“要去请班斯医生，让他给瞧瞧，乖乖，保证一开始就对症下药。然后把艾美送到马奇姑婆家去待一些日子，别让她也染病，你们两个留一个在家里，陪贝丝玩一两天。”

“当然，我留下。我最大。”美格先说，显得既担心又内疚。

“我留下，贝丝生病，都是我不对。我答应过妈妈，这差事我来做，可我没做。”乔坚决地说。

“你想谁留下，贝丝？留一个就够了。”汉娜说。

“请乔留下吧。”贝丝心满意足地把头靠着姐姐。这样问题马上就解决了。

“我去告诉艾美吧。”美格说。她有点不高兴，但实际上也松了口气，因为她并不喜欢当护理，乔却喜欢。

艾美死命反抗，激动地宣布，她宁愿得猩红热，也不愿去马奇姑婆家。美格跟她又是商量，又是恳求，又是下令，都是白费心机。艾美坚决抗命，就是不肯去。美格绝望了，只得弃下她，去找汉娜求救。她还没有回来，劳里就走进了客厅，看到艾美把头埋在沙发垫里抽咽。她诉说了自己的遭遇，满心希望能得到一番安慰。但劳里只是把双手插在口袋里，在房间里踱来踱去，一面轻轻吹着口哨，一面凝眉思索着。不一会儿，他在她身边坐下来，甜言蜜语地哄道：“做个明事理的小妇人吧，要听她们的。好了，别哭了，我告诉你一条快乐妙计。你去马奇姑婆家住，我每天都去接你出去，或是乘车，或是散步，咱们玩个痛快。那不是比闷在这里要好？”

“我不愿被打发走，好像碍着她们似的。”艾美用一种受伤的口吻说道。

“天地良心，孩子，都是为了你好。你也不想染病的吧？”

“当然不想。但我敢说我也会得病，因为我一直跟贝丝在一起。”

“那样子，就更应该马上走开，免得被传染上。我看，换一换空气，小心保养，就能保你平安的，即使不能彻底解决，也会病得轻一些。建议你尽早起程，猩红热可不是闹着玩的，小姐。”

“但马奇姑婆家没意思，她脾气又那么凶。”艾美心有余悸地说。

“有我每天去那里告诉你贝丝的情况，带你出去游逛找刺激，你就不会闷了。老太太喜欢我，我尽量跟她客气点，她就会由着我们，不会来找我们的碴的。”

“你能用那辆大轮子跑车接我出去吗？”

“我以绅士的名誉保证。”

“每天都来？”

“一言为定。”

“贝丝的病一好就带我回来？”

“刻不容缓。”

“真的能去剧院看戏？”

“可能的话，去多少次都成。”

“嗯——那么我想我去吧。”艾美慢吞吞地说。

“好姑娘！叫美格来，告诉她你服从了。”劳里赞许地在艾美身上一拍，其实这比方才“服从”二字更令艾美恼火。

美格和乔冲下楼来，观看这一奇迹。艾美自命不凡，觉得自己做出了自我牺牲，答应如果医生证明贝丝真的有病，她就去。

“小乖乖情况怎么样？”劳里问。他特别宠爱贝丝，心中万分焦急，却不想表露出来。

“现在躺在妈妈的床上，感到好些了。婴儿的死使她心烦意乱，但我敢说她只是感冒了。汉娜说她也是这么认为的，但贝丝愁容满面，这就让我心神不宁。”美格回答。

“人世间真是祸不单行！”乔说道，急切地摆弄着头发，“才过一坎，一坎又来。妈妈不在，我们就像失去了屏障，不知所措了。”

“喂，别把自己弄得像刺猬，不好看的。快把头发弄好，乔，告诉我，是发封电报给你妈妈呢，还是做点什么？”劳里问。他一直对朋友丢掉一个亮点耿耿于怀。

“我正为这犯难呢，”美格说，“如果贝丝真的有病，按理应该告诉她，但汉娜说不能告诉，反正妈妈也搁不下爸爸，那样只能让他们干着急。贝丝不会病很久，汉娜知道解决办法，再说妈妈吩咐过要听她的话，所以我想还是遵命，但我总觉得有点不妥。”

“这个，我也说不清。不如等医生来看过之后，你问问爷爷。”

“对。乔，快去请班斯医生，”美格下达命令，“要等他来了，我们才能做出决定。”

“你别动，乔。我是本处的跑腿员啊。”劳里说着拿起帽子。

“恐怕你忙着呢。”美格说。

“没有，今天的功课已经做好了。”

“你假期也学习吗？”乔问。

“我是学习邻居的好榜样而已。”劳里答罢一头冲出房间。

“作为我的好小伙，我寄予厚望啊。”乔赞赏地笑看他跃过篱笆。

“作为小伙子，他是做得很好。”美格颇不礼貌地回答。她对这个话题不感兴趣。

班斯医生来了，说贝丝是猩红热的症状。尽管他听了胡梅尔家的事态后表情严肃，可还是觉得贝丝并无大碍，吩咐艾美马上离开，并带上一些预防药。艾美在乔和劳里的护送下，堂而皇之地出发了。

马奇姑婆拿出一贯的待客之道加以接待。

“你们现在打算怎么样？”她问道，目光从眼镜框上方瞪着她们。此时，站在她椅子背上的鹦鹉大声叫道：

“滚开。男孩子不准进。”

劳里退到窗边，乔说明了原委。

“果然不出我所料，谁让你们混到穷人堆里呢。艾美如果没得病，可以留下派派用场，不过我肯定她也会病的——看样子现在就像有病的。别哭，孩子，我听到抽鼻子就心烦的。”

艾美正要哭出来，劳里狡猾地扯扯鹦鹉的尾巴，鹦哥宝莉吓得嘎地叫了一声：“哎呀，完了！”模样十分滑稽，引得艾美破涕为笑。

“你们母亲来信怎么说？”老太太粗暴地问道。

“父亲好多了。”乔拼命镇定自己，答道。

“哦，是吗？我看也熬不了多久。马奇家的人一向都没有什么耐力。”老太太开心地回答。

“哈哈！千万别说死，吸一撮鼻烟，再会，再会！”鹦哥尖声高叫，在栖木上跳来跳去。劳里在鸟屁股上一捏，它便去抓老太太的帽子。

“闭嘴，你这没规矩的破鸟！嗳，乔，你最好马上走。不成体统啊，这么晚了还跟一个愣头青瞎逛——”

“闭嘴，你这没规矩的破鸟！”宝莉高叫道，从椅背上一跃而起，冲过来啄那“愣头青”，小伙子听到最后一句早已笑得前仰后合。

“我看这无法忍受，但我要尽量忍着。”孤零零地留在马奇姑婆身边的艾美这样想。

“去你的，丑八怪！”宝莉尖叫。听到这句粗话，艾美忍不住哼了一声。





第十八章　暗无天日


贝丝确实得了猩红热，比大家预料的要严重得多，只有汉娜和医生心中有数。姑娘们对疾病一窍不通，劳伦斯先生也不准过来看望，于是一切都听从汉娜安排。忙碌的班斯医生虽尽力而为，可还是把大量的工作留给了优秀的保姆。美格唯恐把病传染给金家，便留在家里料理家务。她写信时，对贝丝的病情只字不提，为此，心里感到万分焦虑，还有一丝负罪感。她觉得这事不该瞒着母亲，可母亲吩咐要听汉娜的，而汉娜又不愿意马奇太太为区区小事担心。乔日夜都守在妹妹身边，工作并不算辛苦。因为贝丝十分坚强，总是尽量忍着病痛，一声不吭。可有一次，贝丝发高烧，开始喉咙沙哑，说话断断续续，把床单当成心爱的小钢琴，在上面乱弹，还试图唱歌，终因喉咙红肿而唱不成曲。还有一次，她连身边熟识的面容都认不出来了，把她们的名字都张冠李戴，还哀求着要找母亲。这下可把乔吓坏了，美格也请求汉娜，允许她写信把真相告诉父母，连汉娜也说“要考虑考虑，但现在还没危险”。华盛顿的一封来信使形势雪上加霜，马奇先生旧病复发，要再耽搁很久才考虑回家。

现在日子真是暗无天日！屋子里多么悲伤、凄凉！死亡的阴影笼罩着曾经充满欢乐的家，姐妹们在期待中劳作，她们的心情是多么沉重！玛格丽特常常独自坐着淌眼泪，泪珠滴落到针线活上。这时，她深深地感到自己过去是多么富有——拥有爱、庇护、安宁和健康，这些都是生活的恩赐，比什么都珍贵，是金钱买不到的。而乔呢，守在昏暗的房间里，备受病魔折磨的妹妹就躺在眼前，可怜的声音在她耳边萦绕。她了解到贝丝的天性是多么美好、善良，在大家心目中她是那么的体贴、温柔。她还懂得了贝丝无私的愿望是多么可贵，她为别人而活着，以那些每个人都可能拥有的朴实德行，为家庭增添欢乐，而这一切比起才干、财富和美貌都更宝贵，应该加倍热爱、珍惜。艾美呢，寄居在外，渴望着回家照顾贝丝，她觉得做什么都不算艰苦，也不算烦人。多少被她遗忘了的工作都是贝丝主动替她做的，想到这，她心里就感到悔恨不已。劳里像个忐忑不安的鬼魂在屋子里出没。劳伦斯先生也把大钢琴锁起来，因为贝丝此前经常在黄昏时候为他带来快乐，他不愿让琴勾起对这位小邻居的思念。大家都惦记着贝丝。送奶人、面包店老板、杂货店老板和肉贩都询问她好点没有。胡梅尔穷太太来为她的考虑不周而道歉，顺便替明娜要了块裹尸布。邻居们送来了各种安慰和祝福，即使那些最熟悉她的人都觉得奇怪，腼腆的小贝丝竟然结识了这么多朋友。

这时，贝丝躺在床上，身边有乔安娜陪着。即使在神情恍惚的时候，她都没有忘记孤苦伶仃的娃娃。她向往着那几只猫咪，但不愿让人抱过来，唯恐它们也染病。呻吟停住的时候，她还替乔担心。她给艾美送去美好的祝愿，让姐姐转告母亲，自己很快就能写信了，还常常央求着要铅笔和纸，试图写几句。这样，父亲才不会认为她忘了他。可不久，连这些偶尔的清醒都停止了，她久久地躺在床上，辗转反侧，嘴里语无伦次，有时又昏昏睡去，醒来仍是奄奄一息。班斯医生一天来两次，汉娜彻夜守着贝丝，美格把一封电报放在书桌里，准备随时发出去，乔也是不敢离开半步。

十二月一日对她们来说确实是寒冷的一天。凛冽的寒风呼啸，漫天大雪纷飞，这一年似乎也已苟延残喘。那天早上，班斯医生过来，看了贝丝半天，然后用自己的双手把她滚烫的手握了片刻，轻轻地放下，悄悄地跟汉娜说：“马奇太太要是走得开的话，最好现在就叫回来。”

汉娜默默地点点头，双唇紧张地抽搐了一下。美格听了这话，仿佛全身的力气都没了，一下瘫倒在椅子上。乔脸色苍白，呆立了片刻，然后冲到客厅，抓起电报，把衣服往身上一套，飞快地出门，冲进了风雪中。很快她就回来了，无声地脱下披风。这时劳里进来了，手里拿着一封信，说马奇先生正在恢复中。乔感激地读着，可心中沉重的石头似乎还没有落地，她满脸忧愁，于是劳里就问：“怎么啦？贝丝病情加重了？”

“我已经去叫妈妈了。”乔说着，沉着脸使劲地脱皮靴。

“干得好，乔！你自己决定这么做的吗？”劳里问。他见乔双手直抖，就让乔在过道的椅子上坐下，替她脱下那双不听话的靴子。

“不，是医生说的。”

“噢，有那么严重吗？”劳里吃惊地喊道。

“很严重。她不认识我们了，连绿鸽群都不说了，就是墙上树藤的叶子。她一点都不像我的贝丝。我们无依无靠。妈妈和爸爸都不在，上帝又那么远，找都找不到。”

泪珠顺着乔的面颊滚落下来，她无助地伸出手，仿佛在黑暗中摸索。劳里握住乔的手，声音也哽咽了，轻声地说：“我在这里，抓住我，乖乔！”

她说不出话来，可她真的抓住了，这次温暖友好的握手抚慰着她疼痛的心，好像把她引到了上帝神圣的手边，唯此才能在困难时帮她一把。劳里想说几句体己的安慰话，可想不出合适的话，于是他默默地站着，像她母亲常做的那样，轻轻地抚摸乔低垂的头。他也只能如此，可这胜过千言万语，很有安慰力，使她已经感受到了这种无言的同情。沉默中，她体会到了爱化解悲伤时甜蜜的欣慰。很快，她擦干眼泪。落泪倒使心里感到好受些，她满脸感激地抬头望着劳里。

“谢谢你，特迪。我现在好多了，也没那么绝望，万一真有什么事，我会努力挺住的。”

“要往好处想想，那会对你有用的。你妈妈很快就来了，到时候，一切都会好的。”

“爸爸身体好多了，我很高兴。现在妈妈回来，就不会太惦记。噢，天哪！好像真是祸不单行，而我又遭遇了最麻烦的一份。”乔叹了口气，把湿透的手帕摊在膝盖上晾干。

“美格不和你分担吗？”劳里气愤地问。

“哦，分担的，她也尽力了。她没有像我这样爱贝丝，也不会这样思念她。贝丝是我的宝贝，我不能失去她。我不能！绝对不能！”

乔低头用湿手帕捂着脸，绝望地哭了起来。她一直勇敢地坚持着，有泪不轻弹。劳里用手擦了擦眼，说不出话来。他清了一下嗓子里的哽咽，等到嘴唇不抖动了，才张口说话。这也许不是男子汉所为，可他控制不住。不久，乔的呜咽声静了下来，劳里这才满怀希望地说：“相信她不会死。人这么好，我们又都这么爱她，我想上帝还不会把她带走。”

“好人才会死呢。”乔叹息道。可她停止了哭泣，朋友的话使她情绪好了一点，可她内心仍感到疑惑和担心。

“可怜的乔，你够累的了。你可不会绝望。歇会儿。等一下，我要让你高兴高兴。”

劳里一步两个台阶地跑上楼，乔把疲倦的头靠在贝丝的棕色小帽上。贝丝把它留在桌上，还没人想到要拿走。这帽子肯定有魔力，乔似乎变得像它主人那么温柔、听话了。当劳里跑下楼梯的时候，手里拿着一杯酒，乔笑着接过酒杯，鼓足勇气说：“为了贝丝的健康，干杯！你是个好医生，特迪，真会安慰人。该怎么报答你呀？”她又说了一句。酒恢复了她的体力，正如安慰话使她抛弃了烦恼，头脑清醒不少。

“我慢慢会向你讨账的。而今晚，我要给你点东西，肯定比酒更能使你心里舒服的东西。”劳里说着，不禁喜形于色。

“是什么？”乔疑惑地问。她一时忘却了悲伤。

“我昨天拍电报给你妈，布鲁克回电，她就来，今晚到，一切都会没事的。这么做，难道你不开心吗？”

劳里说得很快，立刻变得兴奋起来，脸也涨得通红。由于担心姑娘们失望，贝丝伤心，他一直都把这事瞒着大家。乔脸色发白，从椅子上跳了起来，等他一说完，立刻用双臂搂着他脖子，高兴地喊道：“劳里啊！妈妈啊！我真开心！”这使他如触电一样，大惊失色。她不再哭泣，而是狂笑起来，一边颤抖，一边搂紧她的朋友，仿佛被这突如其来的消息弄迷糊了。

劳里尽管大吃了一惊，却表现得相当镇定。他安慰地轻轻拍着她的背脊，见她正逐渐恢复过来，便腼腆地在她脸上吻了一两下。乔刹那间清醒了。她扶着楼梯扶手，把他轻轻推开，气喘吁吁地说：“噢，别这样！我刚才不是故意的，表现真可怕。你这么可爱，竟然跟汉娜对着干，所以我情不自禁扑向你。把事情经过告诉我吧，别再给我酒喝了，它让我干傻事。”

“我倒不介意。”劳里笑了一下，他整了整领带，接着说道，“是这样，你知道我心神不宁，爷爷也是。我们认为汉娜僭越职权，而你妈应该知情的。如果贝丝——如果有三长两短，她永远都不会原谅我们的。所以，我让爷爷开口说出该采取行动这话，昨天便冲到邮局。你也知道医生神色严峻，而汉娜一听我说发电报就恨不得拧下我的脑袋。我一向不能忍受别人颐指气使，于是打定主意，把电报发了。你妈就要回来了，我知道夜班火车凌晨两点到站。我去接，你只需收敛一下你的狂喜之情，安顿好贝丝，专候母亲来到的佳音。”

“劳里，你真是个天使！要我怎么谢你？”

“再扑过来抱我一次吧。我很喜欢这样。”劳里淘气地说——整整两个礼拜以来，他一直都很规矩。

“不了。等你爷爷来了，我会找个代理人再这么来一下。别闹了，回家休息去吧，半夜还要起来呢。愿上帝保佑你，特迪，上帝保佑你！”

乔已经退到了墙角。说完话，她闪进厨房，坐在碗柜上，跟聚集在那里的猫咪们说：“很开心，哦，真的很开心！”这时劳里出门了，他觉得这事情自己干得很漂亮。

“真是多管闲事，从没见过。可我原谅他，希望马奇太太马上就回来。”听了乔的好消息，汉娜说，她感到松了口气。

美格暗地里一阵狂喜，然后对着那封信左思右想。这时乔把病房整理得井井有条，汉娜匆匆做了几个馅饼，预备着有客人来。屋子里仿佛吹过一阵清风，好像有比阳光更亮的东西照亮了寂静的房间。一切都似乎感受到了这充满希望的变化。贝丝的小鸟又开始唱歌，艾美的窗台花丛中出现了一朵含苞欲放的月季花，炉火也烧得格外欢快。每次姐妹们碰在一起，都要互相拥抱，苍白的脸上露出笑容，悄悄地互相鼓励：“乖乖，妈妈要回来了！妈妈要回来了！”大家都欢天喜地，只有贝丝躺在床上，昏迷不醒，感受不到希望和喜悦，也没有疑虑和恐惧。这是一幅令人生悲的景象——曾经红润的脸蛋变得空白一片，以前忙碌的双手变得骨瘦如柴，从前总挂着微笑的嘴紧闭着，往日漂亮整齐的秀发乱糟糟地散落在枕头上。她整天这样躺着，只是偶尔才醒来喃喃地喊“水！”，双唇干得连话都说不清楚。乔和美格整天伺候在身边，守护着、等待着、期盼着，把一切希望都寄托在上帝和母亲身上。大雪整天下个不停，寒风呼啸，时间过得特别慢。夜幕终于降临了，美格和乔坐在床的两侧，每当时钟敲响，便眼睛一亮，互相看看，因为时钟每响一下，救援就近一步。医生已经来过了，说午夜时分可能会有转机，但吉凶难卜，他到时再来。

汉娜劳累不堪，躺在床脚边的沙发上，很快就睡着了。劳伦斯先生在客厅里踱来踱去，他宁可面对一个反叛的炮兵连，也不愿看到马奇太太进门时焦虑的神情。劳里躺在地毯上，假装休息，可其实他若有所思地注视着炉火，这时他的黑眼睛显得温柔清澈，分外好看。

两姐妹永远都忘不了那个夜晚。她们守候着贝丝，没有一丝睡意，心里却有一种可怕的感觉，感到无能为力，到了这种时候，谁又能怎么样呢？

“要是上帝放过贝丝，我就再也不怨天尤人。”美格低声祈祷，口气十分诚挚。

“要是上帝饶贝丝一命，我愿一生都爱他，做他仆人。”乔同样满怀热情地应道。

“真希望我没有长心脏，免得心痛得要命。”过了一会儿美格叹气道。

“要是人生老是这么苦，不知道以后的日子该怎么挨。”妹妹沮丧地说。

时钟敲了十二下，两个人都忘记了自己，只是一个劲地盯着贝丝，因为她们以为贝丝病态的脸上掠过了一丝变化。屋子里死一般的静寂，只有寒风的呼啸声打破了沉寂。疲惫的汉娜还在睡觉，只有两姐妹看到了什么，犹如一个淡淡的幽灵落到了小床上。一个小时过去了，什么事都没有发生，只有劳里悄悄地出发到车站接人去了。又一个小时过去了，还是没人来。姐妹俩心急如焚，难道是风雪延误，还是路上出了事故，要么最不幸的是华盛顿来了噩耗。

凌晨两点多了，乔站在窗口，心想这个冰封雪飘的世界是多么阴沉。这时，她听到床头有动静，迅速转过身来，看到美格捂着脸跪在母亲的安乐椅前。极端的恐惧攫住了乔的心，她倒吸了一口冷气，心想：“贝丝死了，美格不敢跟我说。”

她立马回到岗位，激动地看到，似乎真的发生了重大转机。贝丝退了烧，脸不再潮红，痛苦的神色已经不见了，昏睡中可爱的小脸蛋显得十分苍白、安详。乔根本不想伤心痛哭。她向自己最亲爱的妹妹俯身下去，深情地在湿润的额头留下一个吻，轻声说：“再见，贝丝，再见！”

仿佛被这声响惊动了，汉娜醒了过来，慌忙来到床前，看着贝丝，摸摸贝丝的双手，又凑到贝丝嘴边听了听，然后把围裙甩过头顶，坐在摇椅上摇来摇去，一边低声叫道：“烧退了！她睡得正香呢，身上在出汗，气也顺畅了。谢天谢地！哦，上帝保佑！”

姐妹俩还没回过神来，这时医生过来证实了这个喜讯。这医生其貌不扬，可在她们看来，他的脸还是无比美好。他慈爱地看着她们，笑着说：“是的，宝贝。我想，小姑娘这回熬过去了。请保持安静，让她睡个够，等她醒过来，给她——”

她们该给她什么，谁都没听到，两个人都蹑手蹑脚来到漆黑的过道，坐在楼梯上，高兴地紧紧搂抱着，满心的话一下子都说不出来了。她们回来的时候，与忠诚的汉娜亲吻拥抱，发现贝丝跟往常一样躺在床上，脸颊垫在手上睡得正香，脸色恢复了红润，平静地呼吸，仿佛是刚刚入睡。

“要是妈妈现在来就好了！”乔说。这时冬夜开始破晓。

“看，”美格拿来一朵半开的白月季说，“我原以为，花儿明天可能还来不及开放，还不能捏在贝丝的手中，要是她——离开我们的话。可它晚上就开了，我想插在这儿——我的花瓶里。等亲爱的妹妹醒来，她第一眼看到的就是这朵小月季，还有妈妈的脸。”

守了一个漫长伤心的不眠夜，第二天清早，美格和乔睁着倦眼，放眼望出去，只见日出显得格外壮丽，世界也显得异常可爱。

“真像个童话世界。”美格站在窗帘后面，望着窗外精彩纷呈的一幕，微笑着说。

“听！”乔喊着跳了起来。

是的，楼下的门铃响了，汉娜大声喊叫，接着是劳里的声音，高兴地轻声说：“姑娘们，她到了！她到了！”





第十九章　艾美的“遗嘱”


家里发生了一连串的变故，而艾美正在马奇姑婆家苦挨。她深深体会到寄人篱下的滋味，生平第一次认识到，自己在家里是如何受到亲人的宠爱。姑婆从不宠爱人，她不赞成溺爱。不过，她也是善意的。小姑娘表现不错，很是讨她欢心，而老人对侄儿的几个孩子心里也确有偏爱，但她认为这种事情是不宜说出来的。她的确在竭尽全力使艾美幸福，但是，天可怜见，她却犯了多大的错误啊！某些老人尽管皱纹累累、白发苍苍，心中却仍然充满朝气，能够和孩子们同喜共忧，使他们感到无拘无束，并能寓教于乐，以最温和的方式给予和得到友谊。可惜姑婆却没有这个天分，她规矩极多，态度严酷，说话啰唆，枯燥乏味，艾美苦不堪言。老太太发现艾美比姐姐更和善听话，便觉得把小姑娘从家里带来的自由散漫、娇生惯养的恶果尽可能改正掉，她自己是责无旁贷。于是，她手把手，按自己六十年前所接受的教育来教导艾美，这样做只令艾美心惊胆战，觉得自己像只落网的苍蝇，无法摆脱自己被束缚的命运。

她每天早上都得擦洗茶杯，把旧式汤匙、圆肚银茶壶、几面镜子擦拭得锃光发亮。接着便得打扫房间，而这个任务真是艰巨，因为没有一粒尘埃躲得过姑婆的眼睛，而家具全部都是爪型腿脚，并刻有很多永远扫不干净的浮雕。然后又得喂鹦哥，给巴儿狗梳毛，还得取东西，传达命令，楼上楼下跑十多个来回，而老太太腿脚极不灵便，不大离开自己的大坐椅。干完这些劳累的活儿，她还得做功课，天天要考验她身上各种美德。最后，才允许她玩一个小时，她是多么受用这段时间哟！劳里每天都过来，甜言蜜语地哄马奇姑婆，直到她答应让艾美跟他一同外出为止。然后，他们一起散步、骑马，尽兴而归。吃过正餐后，她得大声朗读，并坐着一动不动，老太太则在打瞌睡，常常是一页没读完就睡着了，一睡就是个把小时。接着是缝缀各色花布、手巾，艾美外表温顺，内心却在拼命反抗。就这样一直缝到黄昏，才允许随意娱乐，一直玩到茶点时间。晚上的时光最糟糕，姑婆会大讲特讲她年轻时候的故事。这些故事无聊得难以言表，艾美每次都盼着上床睡觉，打算为自己的厄运哭一场，但通常都是还没有挤出半点眼泪便昏昏入睡了。

要不是有劳里和女佣埃丝特老人，她觉得这种可怕的日子简直过不下去。光是那只鹦鹉，就足以令她精神错乱。鸟儿不久便发觉，艾美并不敬重自己，于是做出尽可能淘气的事儿来泄愤。每当她走近，它便去抓她的头发；她刚洗干净鸟笼，它便把面包和牛奶打翻捉弄她；趁老太太打瞌睡又去啄拖把，把狗狗弄得猛吠；还当众咒骂她。总之一举一动都表现得像是十足一个该死的破鸟。她也忍受不了那只狗——一只肥胖，动辄就发脾气的畜生。每逢给它洗澡，它就向她狂吼怒叫；想吃东西时，它就仰躺在地上，四脚朝天，脸上一副痴呆的表情，而这样求食，一天足有十余次之多。厨师脾气粗暴，老马车夫又聋又哑，而唯一理会小姐的人只有埃丝特。

埃丝特是个法国人，她已经和夫人（她这样称呼女主人）共同生活了多年，对老太太有一定的操纵权，老太太没有她便活不下去的。她的真名叫做埃丝苔尔，但姑婆命她改名，她遵从了，条件是永远不能要求她改变宗教信仰。她喜欢上了艾美小姐，熨烫夫人的花边时，常常让她坐在身边，跟她讲生活在法国的奇闻怪事，令艾美神往。她还允许小姐在大宅子里头漫游，仔细欣赏藏在大衣橱和旧式柜子里的奇珍异宝，因为姑婆喜欢收藏品。艾美最中意的是一个印度木柜，里面有许许多多奇形怪状的抽屉、小分类架和暗格，装着各种各样的饰物，有些贵重，有些只是怪异而已，或多或少都是古董了。欣赏和摆弄这些东西，给艾美带来了巨大的满足感，尤其是那些珠宝盒，天鹅绒垫子上沉睡着四十年前曾装点过美女的各式首饰。这里头有一套姑婆踏上社交场合时戴的石榴石饰物、出嫁时父亲送的珍珠、情侣钻、葬礼上戴的黑大理石戒指和发夹，还有一些怪模怪样的宝物盒项链坠子，里头藏着亡友肖像和发编小枕头，她独生女儿戴过的婴儿手镯，马奇姑祖父的大挂表和被许多小孩把玩过的红印章。姑婆的婚戒单独摆在一个盒子里，她的手指长胖了，现在已经戴不进去，于是当作最最宝贵的珠宝珍藏了起来。

“如果她立遗嘱，小姐想选哪一样呢？”埃丝特问。她总是坐在跟前看守着，并把贵重物品锁起来。

“我最爱情侣钻，可惜里头没有项链，而我最喜欢项链，它们漂亮极了。如果可能，我就选这一个。”艾美答道，羡慕不已地望着一串纯金乌木珠链，链子上头沉甸甸地挂着一个用相同材料做成的十字架。

“我也盼着这个呢，但不想要来做项链。啊，不！在我眼里这是一串念珠，我要以一个好天主教徒的身份持着它祈祷。”埃丝特说道，若有所思地端详着漂亮的首饰。

“准备把它当作挂在你镜子上头的那串香木珠链一样使用吗？”艾美问。

“对，正是这样，用来做祷告。这么精美的东西，用来做念珠，而不是当作轻薄的珠宝来佩戴，圣徒们一定更高兴。”

“你似乎能在祷告中得到极大安慰，埃丝特，每次祷告回来你都显得平和、满足。但愿我也能这样。”

“如果小姐是天主教徒，就能找到真正的安慰。既然做不到，也不妨每天独处一室，静思并祈祷。我在侍候夫人之前侍候的那位好太太便是这样。她有个小教堂，发现那是排解大难的安慰物。”

“这样做行吗？”艾美问。她在孤独寂寞中深感需要一种帮助。由于贝丝不在身边提醒自己，她觉得自己都快把那本小册子给忘掉了。

“那很好呀，妙不可言。如果你喜欢，我很乐意把化妆室收拾好给你用。不用告诉夫人，她睡觉时你可以进去独坐一会，坚守善念，祈求天主保佑你姐姐。”

埃丝特十分虔诚，真情劝解，她有爱心，对艾美姐妹们的困境感同身受。艾美觉得这个主意好，便允许她把自己房间隔壁那个亮堂的密室布置起来，希望这样能带来益处。

“真想知道姑婆身后这些漂亮东西会落到哪里。”她说着慢腾腾地把亮晶晶的念珠放回原处，把珠宝箱逐一关上。

“会落到你和几个姐姐手上的。这个我知道，夫人常向我吐露心事的。我见证了她的遗嘱，就是这样写的。”埃丝特微笑着低声道。

“好极了！不过我希望她现在就能给我们。拖延时间并不惬意。”艾美说着向情侣钻望了最后一眼。

“小姐们戴这些东西为时尚早。谁先订婚，谁就得到那套珍珠首饰，夫人说过的。我想，你离开时会送你那只绿松石小戒指，夫人认为你举止有礼，行为迷人。”

“是吗？噢，只要能得到那漂亮戒指，就做个乖乖小羊羔吧！它比吉蒂·布莱恩特的不知要好看多少倍。归根到底，我还是挺喜欢姑婆的。”艾美笑容可掬地把那只蓝色戒指戴上试试，下定决心要赢得它。

从这天开始，艾美更加乖巧听话了，而老太太看到自己的训练大见成效喜不自胜。埃丝特在密室里放上一张小桌子，前面摆一张脚凳，上面挂一幅从一间锁着的屋子里拿来的图画。她认为这画没有什么价值，但题材合适，便把它借来，心里以为夫人永远不会知道，即使知道了也不会管。殊不知这是一幅世界名画的珍贵摹本。爱美的艾美仰望着圣母玛利亚亲切温柔的面孔，心里千头万绪，善念交集，眼睛从不知疲倦。她在桌上放上自己的《新约圣经》和赞美诗集，摆上一个花瓶，每天换上劳里带来的最美的花儿，并天天过来独坐一会，坚守善念，祈求上帝保佑姐姐。埃丝特送给她一串带银十字架的黑色念珠，但艾美怀疑它不适合新教徒做祈祷用，便把它挂起来不用。

小姑娘做这一切是非常诚心的。离开了安全温暖的窝，孤身在外，她强烈地感受到请好心的手扶她一把的需要，于是本能地向那位强大而慈悲的朋友求助，上帝父亲般的爱是如此亲近地怀抱着他幼小的孩子们。她得不到母亲的帮助，去独立思考和自我约束，但现在有人向她指点了方向，她便努力去寻找出路，并满怀信心地踏上行程。不过，艾美是新朝圣者，此刻肩上的担子似乎很沉重。她试图忘掉自己，保持乐观，问心无愧地做人。尽管没有人看到，也没有人为此而赞扬她。为了使自己非常非常地向善，她做出的第一个努力是，像姑婆那样立一个遗嘱。假使她真的病倒、去世，她的财产也可以得到公平慷慨的分割。只要一想到跟自己小小的珍藏分手，她便心如刀割，在她眼里，这些东西跟老太太的珠宝一样珍贵。

她花了一小时娱乐时间，费尽心机拟出了这份重要文件，埃丝特帮她纠正了某些法律用语。热心的法国人签上大名后，艾美这才放心。她把文件放在一边，准备拿给劳里看，希望他做第二个见证人。这天下雨，她到楼上一间大屋子里玩耍，并带上鹦哥做伴。屋子里放着满满一衣橱的旧式戏服，埃丝特允许她穿着这些戏服玩，她于是乐此不疲，穿上褪了色的织锦衣裳，对着立地镜来回检阅，行仪态万方的屈膝礼，长裙摇曳而行，发出悦耳的瑟瑟声。这一天，她玩得不可开交，连劳里拉门铃也没有听到。劳里悄悄探头望进去，恰好见到她手摇扇子，摇头摆脑，煞有介事地踱过来踱过去。她头上缠着巨大的粉红色头巾，与身上的蓝缎子衣裳和拼缝的黄套裙形成了奇怪的反差，由于穿着高跟鞋，走路必须十分谨慎。劳里事后向乔述说了十分滑稽的情节，她身穿华服忸怩向前，鹦哥紧跟，时而侧身游行，时而昂首挺胸，全力亦步亦趋，偶尔又停下来笑一声或高叫：“我们不是挺好吗？去你的，丑八怪！闭嘴！亲亲我，乖乖！哈！哈！”

劳里费了大力，才忍住笑声的爆发，以免惹怒女王陛下。他敲敲门，艾美优雅地把他迎进去。

“坐下歇一会，待我把这些东西卸掉，然后我有极严肃的事情要跟你咨询。”展示完自己的光彩，并把鹦哥赶到墙角后，她这样说。“这只鸟真是我命中的磨难。”她接着又说，说着摘下小山一样的红头巾。劳里则跨坐在一张椅子上。“昨天，姑婆睡着了，我尽量不敢出声，鹦哥却在笼子里尖声高叫，乱扑乱动。我便过去把它放出来，发现笼子里有一只大蜘蛛。我把蜘蛛捅出来，它却溜到书橱下面，鹦哥紧追过去，弯低脖子向书橱下面张望，还抬起单眼，怪模怪样地说：‘出来散步呀，乖乖。’我忍不住笑出了声，宝莉听到后叫骂起来，姑婆被吵醒了，把我们两个骂了一顿。”

“蜘蛛接受那老家伙的邀请了吗？”劳里打着哈欠问。

“接受了，蜘蛛出来了，鹦哥却拔脚就跑，吓得半死。它夺路跳到姑婆的椅子上，一边看我追蜘蛛，一边大叫：‘抓住她！抓住她！抓住她！'”

“撒谎！上帝呀！”鹦鹉叫起来，又去啄劳里的脚趾。

“如果是我养的，就拧断你的脖子，你这孽畜！”劳里向鸟儿挥挥拳头叫道。鹦哥把头一侧躲过，庄严地嘎嘎大叫：“哈利路亚！上帝保佑，乖乖！”

“我好了。”艾美把衣橱门关上，从口袋里掏出一张纸，“我想请你看看，告诉我是否合法、正确。我觉得非做不可，人生无常，我不想身后引起纠纷。”

劳里咬着嘴唇，微微转过身子，背着这位悲天悯人的朋友，带着颇值嘉许的认真劲头，读起了这份错别字百出的文件：





我的遗嘱

我，艾美·科蒂斯·马奇，在此心智健全之际，将全部财产遗曾（赠）做如下安排——

给父亲：我最好的素描、地图及画作，包括画框。还有一百美元给他自由支配。

给母亲：诚挚送上我的全部衣服——有口袋的蓝围裙除外——以及我的肖像、奖章。

给好姐姐玛格丽特：送上我的绿松石戒指（如果能得到），以及画着鸽子的绿箱子，以及我的上等花边给她戴，还有我给她画的肖像，以纪念她的小姑娘。

给乔：留给她我的胸针，封蜡补过的那个，以及我的铜墨水台，她弄丢了盖子的，还有我最珍爱的石膏兔子，因为我很后悔烧掉了她的小说。

给贝丝：（如我先她而去）送上我的洋娃娃和小衣柜、扇子、亚麻布衣领和我的新鞋子，如果她病好后身体瘦下来可以穿下的话。在此，我一并为以前取笑过老乔安娜而致歉。

给我的朋友和邻居西奥多·劳伦斯：遗曾我的制型纸文件夹，陶土模型马，虽然他说过这马没有颈，以及他喜欢的我的任何一幅绘画作品，以报答他在我们痛苦之际对我们的大恩大德，最好是《圣母玛利亚》。

给我们尊敬的恩人劳伦斯先生：留给他盖子镶镜子的紫盒子，这给他装钢笔用很漂亮，并可以使他睹物思人，想起那位对他感激涕零的逝去了的姑娘。感谢他帮助了她全家，尤其是贝丝。

我希望最要好的玩伴吉蒂·布莱恩特得到那条蓝绸缎围裙和我的金珠戒子，连同一吻。

给汉娜：我送上她想要的硬纸匣和我留下的全部拼凑布匹，希望她看到它时就会想起我。

我有价值的财产现已处理完毕，希望大家满意，不会责备死者。我原谅所有人，并相信号角响起时我们会再见。阿门。

公元一八六一年十一月二十日。

艾美·科蒂斯·马奇

见证人：

埃丝苔尔·瓦尔诺

西奥多·劳伦斯





最后一个名字是用铅笔签的，艾美解释说，他要用墨水笔描一次的，并替她把文件妥善封好。

“你怎么会想到这个的？有人告诉你贝丝分派自己的东西了吗？”见艾美在他面前放上一段扎文件用的红带，连同封蜡、一支小蜡烛、一个墨水台，劳里严肃地问。

她于是解释一番，然后焦急地问：“贝丝怎么样啦？”

“我本不该说的，但既然说开了，便告诉你。一天，她觉得自己已病入膏肓，便告诉乔，她想把她的钢琴送给美格，她的猫儿给你，她可怜的旧娃娃给乔，乔会为她而爱惜这个娃娃的。她很遗憾没有多少东西留下，便把自己的头发绺分给我们其他人，把挚爱留给爷爷。她可没想到立遗嘱呀。”

劳里一面说一面签字封口，久久没有抬起头来，直到一颗硕大的泪珠落了到纸上。艾美愁容满面，但她只是问道：“人们有时会在遗嘱上加插附言之类的东西吗？”

“会的，叫做‘补遗’。”

“那么我的也加上一条——我希望把我的鬈发通通剪下来，分送给朋友们留念。我刚才忘了，但我现在要这么做，虽然会毁掉我的遗容。”

劳里把这条加上去，为艾美做出这最后也是最伟大的一个牺牲而笑了。之后，他又陪她玩了一个小时，并耐心听她讲磨难，倒苦水。当他准备告辞时，艾美把他拉住，颤抖的嘴悄声道：“贝丝是不是真有危险？”

“恐怕是这样，但我们必须往好处想。别哭，乖乖。”劳里像哥哥一样伸出手臂护着她，使她感到了莫大的安慰。

劳里走后，她来到了自己的小教堂，坐在黄昏里一边为贝丝祈祷，一边心酸落泪。失去了温柔可爱的小姐姐，哪怕有百万个绿松石戒指，也不能给她带来安慰。





第二十章　推心置腹


对于母女团聚，我想，我没什么可讲的。这样的时刻总是那么愉快，就是描述难了点，索性就留给读者去想象吧。我只想说，屋子里洋溢着真正的幸福，还有，美格美好的愿望终于实现了。当贝丝长长睡了一觉苏醒过来时，首先看到的是一朵小月季，还有妈妈的面孔。身体太虚，她还发不出惊叹，只是笑了笑，紧紧地依偎在慈母的怀里，感到渴望终于得到了满足。然后，贝丝又睡下了，可那瘦弱的手睡梦中还是拉着母亲，母亲不愿把小手掰开，只能靠姐妹俩伺候着她了。

汉娜无法发泄自己的激动心情，便为旅行者准备了一顿丰盛的早餐。美格和乔像孝顺的小鹳一样一边喂母亲进餐，一边听她轻声讲述父亲的情况，还有布鲁克先生答应留下来护理。母亲在归路上因暴风雪耽搁，到站的时候，忧心如焚，又冷又累，而劳里的脸上充满希望，使她得到了难以言表的安慰。

那是一个多么奇怪，又多么愉快的日子！外面是一派银装素裹，生机盎然，所有的人似乎都来到了屋外，迎接第一场雪，而室内是那么宁静，那么平稳。大家护理很辛苦，都入睡了，屋子笼罩在一种安息日的寂静之中。汉娜打着瞌睡，在门口守着。两个大姐如释重负，充满幸福感，终于闭上了疲惫的眼睛，躺着休息，犹如两艘经历了狂风暴雨的小船，正安全地锚泊在风平浪静的港湾。马奇太太不愿从贝丝身边离开，便坐在大椅子上养神，还不时睁开眼睛，瞧瞧、摸摸，对着孩子沉思，俨然一个守财奴看管着失而复得的财宝。

与此同时，劳里匆匆出发去安慰艾美。他故事讲得很精彩，连姑婆都鼻子里哼出几声笑，而且一次都没再说“我早就跟你讲过了”之类的话。艾美这回表现得十分坚强，看来她在小教堂里下的善念功夫开始开花结果了。她很快就把泪水擦干，按捺住要见母亲的迫切心情。当劳里说她表现得像个一流的小妇人，而老太太也由衷地表示赞同时，她竟没有想到那枚绿松石戒指。甚至鹦哥也似乎深受感动，连连叫她“好姑娘”，并用极其友好的声调求她“出来散步呀，乖乖！”。她本来很高兴出去，在阳光明媚的雪地里玩个痛快，但发现劳里尽管男子气地掩饰着，身子却困得直往下倒，便劝他在沙发上躺躺，自己则给母亲写封信。过了好一会儿她才把信写完，等她再次出现时，劳里头枕双臂，直挺挺地酣睡着。姑婆拉下了窗帘，闲坐在一边，一时显出少有的和蔼态度。

过了一会儿，她们开始意识到，他要睡到晚上才能醒过来了。要不是艾美看见母亲而发出欢叫声把他惊醒，我看没有把握他会醒。那天，城里城外可能有许许多多幸福的小姑娘，但依我看艾美要算是最最幸福的一个，她坐在母亲膝头上诉说自己的磨难，母亲则报以赞赏的微笑和百般爱抚。两人单独来到小教堂，艾美解释了它的来龙去脉，母亲听后并不反对。

“相反。我挺喜欢它的，乖乖。”她把眼光从沾灰的念珠，移到翻烂的小册子和点缀着常青树花环的美图上，“事情不如意，令人烦恼悲伤时，能找个地方清静一下是大好事。人世间有很多艰难困苦，只要我们求助的方法对路，就总能挺过来的。我想我的小女儿正在领会这个道理呢。”

“是的，妈妈，回家后我打算在大壁橱的一角放上我的书和我画的那幅图画的摹本。圣母的面孔画得不好——她太美了，我画不来。但圣婴还画得不错，我很喜欢。我喜欢想，他也曾经是个小孩，这样我就显得离神更近了。这样一想，就好办了。”

艾美指指笑着坐在圣母膝上的基督圣婴，马奇太太看到她举起的手上戴着一样东西，不觉笑了。她没有说什么，但艾美明白了她的眼神，她沉吟了一会儿，郑重其事地说：“我原本要告诉的，但一时忘了。姑婆今天把这戒指送给了我。她把我叫到跟前，吻了我一下，把它戴在我的手指上，并且说我替她增了光，她愿意把我永远留在身边。戒指绿松石太大，她便把这滑稽的护圈给我戴上。我想戴着它们，妈妈，可以吗？”

“很漂亮。不过我认为你年龄小，不大适宜戴这种饰物，艾美。”马奇太太看着那只胖嘟嘟的小手，食指上戴着一圈天蓝色宝石和一个由两个金色小箍扣在一起组成的古怪护圈。

“我会努力做到不图虚荣的。”艾美说，“我想，并不只是因为漂亮才喜欢它，戴上是因为能时刻提醒我一下，就像故事里女孩戴手镯一样。”

“你是指姑婆吗？”母亲笑着问。

“不是，提醒我不要自私。”艾美的神情十分诚恳，母亲不禁止住了笑，器重地倾听女儿的小计划。

“最近，我常常反省自己的一大堆毛病，发现最大的一项是自私，要尽可能努力克服这个缺点。贝丝就不自私，所以大家都爱她，一想到要失去她就那么伤心。如果我病了，大家就远远不会这么伤心，我也不配让他们这样。不过，很希望能有许许多多的朋友爱我、怀念我，所以我要努力，尽量向贝丝姐学习。只是我常常忘了自己下的决心，如果身边有什么东西在时刻提醒我，我想就会做得好一点。我们这样做行吗？”

“行啊，不过我倒是对你设立壁橱一角更有信心。戒指就戴着吧，乖乖，然后好自为之。我相信你会有长进的，因为诚心学好便是成功的一半。现在得回去陪贝丝了。振作起精神，小女儿，很快就会接你回家的。”

那天傍晚，美格正给父亲写信，报告旅行者平安到家。乔悄悄上楼，来到贝丝的房中，发现母亲还在老地方。她站了片刻，用手指绞着头发，摆出一副忧心忡忡、犹豫不决的样子。

“怎么了，宝贝？”马奇太太拉住她的手，关切地问，脸上的神情也怂恿女儿敞开心扉。

“妈妈，我想跟您说点事。”

“有关美格的？”

“猜得真准！是的，有关美格的，事情不大，可我很烦。”

“贝丝在睡觉，你小声点，跟我说，到底是怎么回事。我想那个莫法特没来过的吧？”马奇太太问，声音颇为严厉。

“没有，他来的话，我肯定会把他挡在门外。”乔说着，坐在母亲脚边的地上，“今年夏天，美格在劳伦斯先生家里丢了一副手套，只找回了一只。我们都把这事给忘了。后来，特迪跟我说，是布鲁克先生拿了另一只，一直放在马甲口袋里。有一次，手套掉了出来，特迪还笑他呢。另外，布鲁克先生承认，他喜欢美格，只是不敢开口。美格还年轻，布鲁克又那么穷。你看，事情是不是很可怕？”

“你觉得美格喜欢他吗？”马奇太太担心地问。

“天哪！爱情这种无聊的事，我什么都不懂！”乔喊道，脸上既感兴趣又不屑一顾的神情，甚是滑稽，“小说里，女孩子产生爱情，不是心跳脸红，昏死过去，就是变得消瘦憔悴，做出的事都跟傻子一样。现在美格还没成这个样子，吃、喝、睡都很正常。我一说到那个男的，她都会盯着我看。只有特迪拿情人们开玩笑的时候，她才会稍微脸红一下。我不让他开这种玩笑，可他就是不听。”

“那你以为美格不喜欢约翰咯？”

“谁？”乔瞪大眼睛问。

“布鲁克先生，我现在叫他‘约翰’。是在医院的时候开始这么叫他的，他也喜欢我们这么叫的。”

“噢，老天！我知道了，你会帮他的。他对爸爸不错，你不会把他打发走的。要是美格愿意，就让她嫁给他。哄爸爸，又帮您，就是为了骗得你们的喜欢，真卑鄙！”乔又愤怒地揪起了头发。

“乖乖，别为这事发火，我会告诉你是怎么回事。约翰是受了劳伦斯先生的委派陪我一起去的，他对你可怜的爸爸照顾得很周到，我们这才觉得他挺可爱的。他对美格的事很光明正大。他跟我们说，他爱美格，可先得挣下一个舒服的家，然后再向她求婚。他只要我们答应让他爱美格，让他为美格效劳，要是他能的话，就赢得美格也爱他。他真的是不错的小伙子，我们不能拒绝他的要求，可我也不会答应，让美格这么年轻就订婚。”

“当然不行，那样太白痴！早就知道里面有鬼，我早就感觉到了。没想到会这么糟糕。我只希望我自己可以和美格结婚，这样就可以让她平安留在家里了。”

这个古怪的想法使马奇太太忍俊不禁。她严肃地说：“乔，我对你推心置腹，你暂时别对美格说。等约翰回来，我就可以看见他们俩聚首，美格对他怎么样的感情，不是一目了然吗？”

“她常说起那双漂亮的眼睛，她会领会他的情意的，到那时，美格一切都完了。她的心又那么软，要是有人含情脉脉地看着她，她的心就会像太阳底下的黄油，马上就化掉了。她读他寄来的简报，比读你的信还起劲呢。我一提这事，她就掐我。她喜欢棕色眼睛，觉得约翰这个名字也不难听。她会坠入爱河的，我们在一起时的宁静、快乐、舒适的时光就要完结了。我都想到了！他们会满屋子谈恋爱，我们只能躲开。美格会爱昏了头，不会再对我那么好了。布鲁克会凑到一大笔钱，把她抬走，这样我们家里就会出现空洞。我的心会破碎的，一切都会变得让人讨厌。噢，老天！我们为什么不是男孩，那样就不会有烦恼了。”

乔闷闷不乐地把下巴靠在膝头上，对那位该死的约翰猛挥拳头。马奇太太叹了一口气，乔抬起头来，如释重负地舒了一口气。

“你不喜欢这样的吧，妈妈？这真叫我高兴。我们让他自己忙乎去，也不要告诉美格，一家人还跟原来一样，一起快乐生活。”

“刚才叹气是我做得不对，乔。你们日后各自成家立业，是自然要发生的事情，也是对的，但我确实想让女儿们在身边多留几年。我很遗憾这件事来得这么快，美格才十七岁，而约翰也要过好几年才有能力组织家庭。我和你父亲的意见是，二十岁前她不能订下任何盟誓，也不能结婚。如果她和约翰相爱，他们可以等，这样也可以考验他们的爱情。她做事认真负责，我倒不担心她会待他不好。美丽、善良的女儿，我希望她姻缘美满哪！”

“您难道不希望她嫁个阔佬吗？”乔问。刚才说到最后，母亲的口气软了下来。

“金钱是一种很有用处的好东西，乔，我既不希望我的女儿生活捉襟见肘，也不希望她们受富贵浮云的诱惑。我希望约翰有份稳定的好职业，收入足以远离债务，使美格生活舒适。我并不奢求我的女儿嫁入名门望族，金玉满堂，地位煊赫。如果地位和金钱与爱情和品行并行不悖，我感激地接受，并分享你们的福气。但根据经验，我知道普通的小户人家虽然每天都要为生活操劳，却可以拥有真正的幸福，一点点的缺衣少食，却使偶然的福气带来甜蜜温馨。看到美格从低微起步，我也心满意足。如果我没有看错的话，约翰是个好男人，她将因拥有他的心而变得富有，而这比金钱更为宝贵。”

“我明白的，妈妈，也很赞同，但我为美格感到失望。我一向计划让她日后嫁给特迪，一生享尽荣华富贵。那不好吗？”乔仰头问道，脸色开朗了一点。

“他比她年纪小，你知道的。”马奇太太刚说了一句，乔便打断她：“只是小一点儿，他少年老成，个子又高，如果他愿意，他的言谈举止可以像个大人的。再说他富有、慷慨、人品好，而且爱我们全家。这计划泡了汤，我感到十分惋惜。”

“恐怕，在美格眼里，劳里还是个小孩子，再说，他太像风向标了，说变就变，靠不住。乔，你就别操心了，等以后，让你朋友们自己的心来决定他们的伴侣吧。掺和这些事我们没把握的，最好还是别去想那些事情，就是你说的乱七八糟的浪漫，弄不好会伤了邻里和气。”

“好吧，我不管。可我最讨厌的是，本来很容易理清楚的事情，这下越来越错综复杂，纠缠不休了。真希望我们头上都能有个熨斗压着，那样就不会长大了。可花蕾总会开放成月季花，小猫咪总要长成大猫！”

“猫呀、熨斗呀，你们在说什么哪？”美格问。她悄悄地走进房间，手里拿着写好的信。

“只是胡扯而已。我去睡觉了。来吧，亲爱的。”乔说着，就像动画拼图解谜玩具伸了个懒腰。

“很对，写的好文章。请再加一句，说我向约翰问好。”马奇太太看了一遍，然后还给美格。

“您叫他‘约翰’? ”美格笑着问，天真的眼睛盯住母亲。

“是的，他像我们的儿子，我们很喜欢他的。”马奇太太回答。她也热切地望着美格。

“这么说，我很高兴，他确实很孤独。晚安，亲爱的妈妈。有您在这里，真是说不出的舒服。”美格轻声回答。

母亲给了她一个深情的吻。她离开时，马奇太太既满意又不无遗憾地说：“她还没有爱上约翰，可很快就会的。”





第二十一章　劳里胡闹，乔来平息


第二天，乔的脸依旧很费猜详，神秘兮兮，煞有介事。秘密还压在心头，她发现要装出一副若无其事的样子也不容易。美格看在眼里，也不急着打听，她知道对付乔的最佳办法就是逆反心理，所以她敢肯定，要是不问，乔一定会和盘托出的。因此，看到乔依旧沉默不语，她颇感奇怪。乔还摆出一副盛气凌人的架子，这使美格大为恼火，于是她也装出一副高不可攀的样子，只伺候着母亲。这么一来，乔只好另找出路了。马奇太太接替乔担任护理，让长期困在家里的乔休息、锻炼、玩乐。艾美不在，劳里成了乔唯一的伙伴。她虽然喜欢与劳里在一起，此时却有点怕他，因为他喜欢作弄人，简直到了无可救药的地步，乔就怕他从自己嘴里套去秘密。

她一点都没错，这个喜欢胡闹的家伙猜想乔有个秘密，于是就下决心要打探个明白，这就使乔够受的。他哄骗奚落、威逼利诱，要不就骂人，表面上装作毫不在意的样子，其实想出其不意地从乔口中掏走真相。他先宣称自己知道了，随后又说自己不在乎，最后凭借这软磨硬泡的功夫，他满意地发现秘密涉及美格和布鲁克先生。他愤愤不平，自己的家庭教师竟然不跟他推心置腹。他要开动脑筋，想出适当的办法好好报复一下，出出横遭轻慢这口怨气。

美格此时显然已忘记了此事，专心地为父亲的归来做着准备。但突然间，她似乎发生了变故，有一两天简直变得面目全非。听到有人叫她便大吃一惊，人家望她一眼便面红耳赤。整天默默不语，做针线活时独坐一边，羞答答的，心事重重。母亲过问，她回答自己很好，乔问她，她便求她别管。

“她于无形中感受到这种东西——我是指爱情——而且进展得很快。那些症状她几乎全有了——颤抖、暴躁、不吃、不睡，私下里郁郁寡欢。我还发现她在唱他给的那首歌，一次竟然像您一样说‘约翰’，迅即脸红得像朵罂粟花。我们到底该怎么办？”乔说。看样子她准备采取措施，无论多么激烈也在所不惜。

“只有等待。不要理她，要和气耐心，等爸爸回来，事情就能解决了。”母亲回答。

“美格，这里有一封你的信，还封得这么严实！真怪！特迪给我的信从来不封。”第二天，乔边说边分发小信箱中的信件。

马奇太太和乔都在埋头忙各自的活计，突然听到美格一声喊叫。她们抬起头来，只见美格神色惊慌地盯着那封信。

“孩子，怎么了？”母亲跑过去问，这时乔试图夺过这封胡闹的信。

“全乱套了——他可没有写过这样的信。乔，你怎么能这样？”美格用手捂着脸哭，似乎心都碎了。

“我！我什么也没干！她在说什么？”乔疑惑地喊道。

美格温柔的眼睛射出了一道道怒光，她从口袋里掏出已揉成一团的信，一把扔给乔，责骂道：“你写的，那臭小子帮你写的。你怎么能这么无礼，这么卑鄙，对我们两个这么残酷？”

乔差不多什么都没听到，因为她和母亲在读信。这信的笔迹非同寻常。





最亲爱的玛格丽特：

我再也控制不住自己的感情，一定要在回来之前就知道我的命运。我现在还不敢让你的父母知道，可我想，只要他们了解我们深深相爱，就会答应的。劳伦斯先生会帮我找份好工作，再说你，亲爱的宝贝，你会使我幸福。我求你，先瞒着家人，只请写一句希望的话给我，让劳里转交。

深爱你的约翰





“噢，这个小坏蛋！我为妈妈保密，他就这样报答我。我去把他臭骂一顿，押他过来求饶。”乔叫道，恨不得立即法办真凶。但母亲脸上带着一种少见的神情，拦住她说：“站住，乔，你首先得撇清自己。你搞了那么多恶作剧，恐怕这事也插了一手。”

“我发誓，妈妈，没有！根本没看过这封信，也不知情，千真万确！”乔说话时神情极其认真，母亲和美格相信了她，“如果我参与了，会干得更巧妙，写一封合情合理的信。我想你们也知道，布鲁克先生不会写出这种混账东西的。”她接着说，轻蔑地把信抛下。

“这字像是他写的。”美格结结巴巴地说，把这封信和手中的一封作比较。

“哎呀，美格，没回信吧？”马奇太太急问。

“我，我回了！”美格再次掩着脸，羞愧难当。

“那可糟糕！快让我把那坏小子押过来教训一顿，让他解释清楚。不把他抓来我不得安宁哪。”乔又向门口冲去。

“闭嘴！这事我来处理，比我想象的更糟。玛格丽特，把事情从头说清楚。”马奇太太下令，一面在美格身边坐下，一面用手抓着乔不放，以免她溜出去。

“第一封信来自劳里那儿，他看上去似乎不知情的。”美格低着头说，“一开始我担心了，打算告诉您的，后来想起您喜欢布鲁克先生，我便想，即使把这小小的秘密藏上几天，您也不会怪我的。我真傻，以为没有人知道，而当我考虑怎么回答时，我觉得自己就像书里头那些惹上这种事的女孩子。原谅我，妈妈，我做的傻事现在得到了报应，我再也没脸见他了。”

“你跟他说了些什么？”马奇太太问。

“我只说我年龄小，还不考虑这种事情，说我不想瞒着你们，他必须跟父亲说。我对他的善意万分感激，愿做朋友，但仅此而已，其他以后再说。”

马奇太太露出了欣慰的笑容，乔拍手称快：

“你可真是不亚于卡罗琳·珀西，堪称谨言慎行的楷模哩！往下说，美格。他看了怎么说？”

“他回信的写法完全不同，说从来没有寄过什么情书。他很遗憾，我那调皮捣蛋的妹妹乔竟这样轻薄我们的名字。信中态度和善，毕恭毕敬，但想想我有多尴尬！”

美格靠在母亲身上，成了绝望的翻版。乔一面急得直骂劳里，一面在屋里团团乱转。忽然，她停下来，拿起两张纸条，细细比看了，断然说道：“我看，布鲁克根本没有见过这两封信。都是特迪写的，他把你的信留着，用来奚落我，谁叫我不把秘密告诉他。”

“不要藏什么秘密，乔。告诉妈妈，远离麻烦，我本该那么做的，”美格警告道。

“好家伙，孩子！妈妈说过的。”

“行了，乔。我安慰美格，你去把劳里找来。我要细查此事，立即终止这出恶作剧。”

乔跑出去了，马奇太太轻声跟美格说出布鲁克先生的真实感情。“嗯，乖乖，你自己的意思呢？是否爱他？爱得足以等到他有能力为你组织家庭的那一天？或者你宁可暂时无牵无挂？”

“我吃够了担惊受怕的苦头，起码很长一段时间，我都不想跟情郎有什么瓜葛了，也许永远都不。”美格使着性子说道，“如果约翰不知道这桩荒唐事，那就别告诉他，让乔和劳里闭上嘴。我不想被人蒙在鼓里当傻子耍——有多难为情啊！”

马奇太太看到向来温柔的美格被激怒了，恶作剧伤害了她的自尊心，于是安慰美格，向她保证闭口不提此事，以后也会审慎处理。听到过道里传来劳里的脚步声，美格立刻跑进了书房，马奇太太独自接见了罪人。乔怕他不肯来，没有说为什么找他。可他一看到马奇太太的脸就明白了。他站在一边转着帽子，一副惭愧的样子，一看就知道是他干的。乔被支开了，但她在过道里踱来踱去，宛如害怕犯人跑掉的哨兵。客厅里说了半个钟头，声音忽高忽低，可接见时到底发生了什么，姑娘们都不知道。

她们被叫进来时，劳里站在母亲身旁，一脸悔过的样子，乔当场就原谅他了，只是觉得此时表露出来并不明智。劳里低声下气地向美格道歉，听到劳里保证布鲁克对此玩笑一无所知时，美格心里大为宽慰。

“我到死都不会跟他说——一言既出，驷马难追。美格，请原谅我。为了表示我不折不扣的歉意，我愿意为您做牛做马。”他接着说，一副羞愧难当的样子。

“我尽力吧，可这样做确实没有绅士风度。想不到你竟然会这么狡诈，这么恶毒。”美格答道。她尽量用严肃的语气责备劳里，借以掩饰少女的尴尬。

“总之，这实在可恶，一个月没人理我，也是活该，可你还是会理我的，是吧？”劳里拱起双手抱拳，做出一个恳求的姿势，那语气的说服力简直无法抗拒。虽然他干了坏事，可大家没法再对他横眉冷对。美格原谅了他，马奇太太虽然努力显得严肃，可听到他宣称愿意做牛做马来赎罪，又在受辱的小姐面前表现得低声下气，她板着的脸也舒展开来。

这时，乔远远地站在一边，试图要硬了心肠对待劳里，也就装出一副不以为然的样子。劳里瞟了她两眼，可她毫无容情之意，他深感冤屈，于是转身背对着她。等到其他人都说完了，劳里深深地向她鞠了一躬，然后一声不吭地走了。

劳里一走，乔就后悔，自己应该再宽容些的。等母亲和美格上了楼，她又感到一阵寂寞，渴望着见到特迪。犹豫片刻之后，她还是控制不了这种冲动，便抱上一本要还的书，来到了大房子。

“劳伦斯先生在吗？”乔问正在下楼的女仆。

“在，小姐。恐怕暂时不想见人。”

“怎么啦？病了吗？”

“唉，不，小姐。他刚跟劳里少爷吵了一架。少爷不知怎么了，大发脾气，使老先生大为恼火，我也不敢靠近他。”

“劳里在哪里？”

“自己锁在房间里，我敲了半天，就是不开门。饭菜已经做好了，没人吃，不知道该怎么办。”

“我去看看是怎么回事。他们两个我谁都不怕。”

乔上楼，猛敲劳里小书房的门。

“别敲了，小心我开门收拾你！”小绅士朝门外扬言道。

乔马上又敲，门突然开了。劳里还没回过神来，乔就跳了进去。乔看到劳里真的在发脾气，可她知道怎么对付他。于是，她摆出一副懊悔的样子，双膝款款跪下，温顺地说：“我脾气不好，请原谅我吧。我是来讲和的，你不答应，我就不走了。”

“没关系，起来吧，别做憨鹅。”她的请求得到了这么一个简慢的回答。

“谢谢，我会的。请问出了什么事？你似乎心里不大畅快。”

“我被人推搡了，忍无可忍！”劳里愤怒地吼道。

“谁推搡你了？”乔问。

“爷爷。如果换了别人，我早就——”受伤的年轻人右臂狠狠一挥，把话止住。

“那有什么。我也常常推搡你，你不生气的。”乔安慰道。

“呸！你是姑娘家，那样推搡很来劲，但不允许男人推搡我。”

“如果你像现在这样暴跳如雷，我想没人要一试身手的。为什么那样对你？”

“就因为我不肯告诉他，你妈妈为什么把我叫去。我答应过不说的，当然不能食言。”

“难道不能换个说法满足爷爷吗？”

“不能，他就是要说出真相，全部真相，只说真相。假如能不牵涉到美格，倒可以告诉他我那部分糊涂真相。既然不能，我便一言不发，由他去骂，最后老头竟一把抓住我的领口。我气坏了，赶紧脱身溜掉，担心自己失控。”

“这样是不对，但我知道他后悔了，还是下去和解吧。我来帮你说。”

“死也不去的！我不过开了一个玩笑，难道你们要人人教训一顿，痛打一下不成？我是对不起美格，也已经堂堂正正地道了歉。但我现在没有做错事，所以我决不道歉。”

“但他并不知道的呀。”

“他应该信任我，不要把我当婴儿对待。没有用的，乔，他得明白我能够照顾自己，不需要拉着人家的围裙带子走路的。”

“你们都是辣椒罐子！”乔叹道，“你打算这事怎么解决？”

“哦，爷爷应该道歉。说过这大惊小怪的事不能告诉他，就应该相信我的。”

“哎呀！他不会道歉的。”

“不道歉就不下去。”

“哎，特迪，理智一点。就让这事过去吧，我会尽力解释清楚的。总不能老待在这里吧，这么任性可不好？”

“我本来就不打算在这里久留。我要悄悄溜走，浪迹天涯。爷爷想我时，很快就会回心转意了。”

“但恐怕不该这样让他担心的。”

“别说教了。我要去华盛顿看布鲁克。那地方充满乐趣，我要丢下忧愁，痛快一下。”

“那样多有趣！恨不得我也能出走。”乔脑海里泛起一幅幅生动的首都军营生活画面，立刻忘记了自己的良师益友角色。

“那就一起走吧，嗨！为什么不呢？你给父亲一个惊喜，我给布鲁克一个突然袭击。这个玩笑妙不可言。干吧，乔。我们留一封平安信，然后立即出发。我有足够的钱。你是去看父亲啊，百利而无一害。”

乔一度似乎就要同意了，这个计划虽然轻率，却正合她的性格。她早已厌倦了操心和禁闭的生活，渴望改变一下环境，想到父亲，想到新奇、充满魅力的军营和医院，想到自由自在的游乐生活，那是多么令人向往。她憧憬地向窗外望去，眼睛闪闪发亮，但目光落到了对面的老屋上面。她摇摇头，伤心地做出了决定。

“假如我是个男孩子，我们就可以一起出走，玩个痛痛快快。但我是悲惨的女孩子，只能规矩地待在家里。别引诱我了，特迪，这是个疯狂的计划。”

“乐趣正在这里呀。”劳里说。他天生任性，冲动之下，疯狂地打算冲破束缚。

“住嘴！”乔捂着耳朵叫道，“‘装腔作势’就是我的宿命。我趁早认命吧。我是来感化你的，不是来听你说令我落荒而逃的勾当的。”

“我知道美格会给这种计划泼冷水，还以为你更有胆识呢。”劳里用激将法。

“坏小子，收声吧！坐下好好反思自己的罪过，别煽动我罪上加罪。如果我动员你爷爷来向你赔个不是，你就不出走了吧？”乔严肃地问。

“是啊，但你办不到。”劳里答道。他愿意和解，但觉得必须先平息自己的怨气。

“我既然能对付小的，就能对付老的。”乔走开时咕哝着。劳里双手托着脑袋，盯着铁路图看。

乔敲响了劳伦斯先生的门。“进来！”老先生的声音听起来更加沙哑了。

“是我呀，先生，来还书的。”她泰然地回答，说着走了进去。

“还要再借吗？”老人脸色十分难看，心烦意乱，却尽量掩饰着。

“要的。我迷上了约翰逊[1]，想读读第二部的。”乔答道。希望靠再借一本鲍斯韦尔[2]的《约翰逊传》，来平息老人的心情，他曾经力荐这本生动传神的著作。

他把踏梯推到放约翰逊文学的书架前，紧锁的浓眉舒展了一些。乔跳上去，坐在踏梯顶上，假装找书，心里却在盘算着怎样开口，才能提起她来访的危险目的。劳伦斯先生似乎猜到了她心里有事，他在屋子里快步兜了几圈，然后转头看着她，突然发问，吓得乔失手，《拉塞拉斯王子传》[3]封面朝下扑到了地上。

“那孩子干了些什么？别护着他。看他回来时那副架势，我就知道肯定淘气了。他一句话都掏不出来。我就扬言要推搡他，逼他说出真相，他就冲到楼上，把自己锁在房间里。”

“他是做错了事，可我们原谅他了，而且都答应跟谁也不说的。”乔迟疑地说。

“那不行，不能因为你们姑娘们心肠软就答应，便可以逍遥躲起来了。如果他干了错事，就应该坦白道歉，并受到惩罚。说出来吧，乔，我可不想被蒙在鼓里。”

劳伦斯先生脸色可怖，声调严厉，可能的话，乔真想拔腿就跑。但她正坐在高高的踏梯上，而他就站在脚下，俨如一只挡道的狮子。她只好原地不动，鼓足勇气开了口。

“真的，先生，不能说。妈妈不许说。劳里已经坦白了，道歉了，并受到了足够的重罚。我们不说出来，不是护着他，而是要护着另一个人。如果你干预，只会增加麻烦。请高抬贵手不管吧。我也有部分责任，不过现在没事了。我们还是把它忘掉，谈谈《漫游者》或什么令人愉快的东西吧。”

“去他的《漫游者》！爬下来向我保证，我家那冒冒失失的小子没有做出什么忘恩负义、鲁莽无礼的事情。如果他做了，尽管你们对他这么好，我还是要亲手鞭打他。”

此话听起来十分可怕，却并没有吓倒乔。她知道这个性格暴躁的老头绝不会动他的孙子一个指头的，不管他怎么扬言。她顺从地走下踏梯，把恶作剧尽量轻描淡写地复述了一遍，既不泄露美格，也不遗漏事实。

“嗯——哈——好吧，要是这孩子不肯说，不是由于顽固不化，而是由于答应过你们，那就饶他算了。他很固执，很难管的。”劳伦斯先生一边说着，一边不停地搔头发，直到头上仿佛被大风吹过一样怒发冲冠。这时，他松了口气，紧皱的眉头也舒展开来。

“我也很固执，千军万马都管不了我，可一句好话就能让我服服帖帖的。”乔努力为朋友说句好话。要知道，劳里是刚摆脱了一种困境，又陷入了另一种麻烦。

“你觉得我待他不好，是吧？”老人厉声对道。

“天哪，不是的，先生，您有时候待他太好了。他考验您的耐心时，您就会急不可耐，恨铁不成钢的。您看是不是这样？”

乔决定一吐为快，表面上尽量显得平静，不过等她壮着胆子说完后，不由得哆嗦了一下。老人只是把眼镜啪地往桌上一扔，坦诚地大声道：“没错，丫头，是这样！我爱这孩子，可他常让我受不了，要是我们老是这样，真不知道该如何了结。”这回答虽然出乎意料，却使她松了口气。

“我跟您说吧，他要出走。”这话一出口，乔就后悔了。她本意是告诫老人，劳里不会忍受太多的束缚，希望他更加容忍这小伙子。

老先生红润的脸立刻就变色了。他坐下来，沮丧地朝挂在桌子上方的美男子像瞟了一眼。那是劳里的父亲，年纪轻轻就出走了，违拗这位固执老人的意志结了婚。乔猜想他想起了往事，并为之深感遗憾。真希望刚才自己什么都没说。

“除非他真的心烦意乱，不然不会这么做的。有时他书读厌了也会说，可那只是说说而已。我倒常想出走，特别是剪了头发以后。所以，要是您发现我们丢了的话，可以发个寻人启事，找两个男孩子，也可以到开往印度的船上找找。”

她边说边笑，劳伦斯先生神态放松了，显然只把这当成了一个笑话。

“你这娘们，怎么敢那样讲？眼里还有我吗？这么没规矩。愿上帝保佑他们！如今的姑娘、小伙子真是麻烦，可少了他们，我们也活不了。”说着，他愉快地在乔脸上捏了一把，“去，叫这孩子下来吃饭，告诉他没事了，叫他最好别在爷爷面前哭丧着脸。那样，我受不了。”

“他不会来的，先生。他心情很坏，当时说不便跟您说，您却不信。我想您的推搡大大挫伤了他的感情。”

乔努力装出一副可怜的样子，可肯定没成功，因为老先生忍不住笑了，乔明白大功告成了。

“那事我很抱歉，我想，还得感谢他没有推搡我。那小子到底想要什么呢？”老人对自己暴躁的脾气显得有点惭愧。

“先生，如果我是您，就会给他写一封致歉信。他说，您不道歉，他是不会下楼的。他还谈到了要出走华盛顿，而且越说越荒唐。一封正式的致歉信会让他明白自己是多么愚蠢，再说，他也会和颜悦色地下楼。写一封吧，他喜欢开玩笑，这比嘴上说好多了。我拿上去，教他该怎么行孝道。”

劳伦斯先生瞪了她一眼，戴上眼镜，慢慢地说：“真是个狡猾的丫头，可被你和贝丝摆布，我也不在乎。好吧，拿纸来，让我们把这无聊的事情结束掉。”

这封信言辞恳切，就像一位绅士深深得罪另一位绅士后表达歉意。乔在老先生的秃顶上丢下了一个吻，跑上楼把致歉信从劳里的门缝下面塞进去，透过钥匙孔劝他要听话、有涵养，又讲了一些好听的大道理。看到门又锁上了，她便把信留在那儿发酵，自己则打算悄悄走开，可年轻人已经从楼梯扶手上滑了下去，站在下面等她，面孔流露出一种无比贤明的神情。“你真是好人，乔！刚才有没有挨训？”他笑着说。

“没有，总的说来，他相当心平气和呢。”

“啊！我全想通了。连你都把我丢弃在那里，我感到要去见鬼了呢。”他内疚地说。

“别这么说，翻开新的一页，重新开始，特迪，我的孩子。”

“我不断翻开新的一页，又一一糟蹋掉，就像小时候糟蹋掉抄写本一样。我开的头太多了，永远不会有终结的。”他悲哀地说道。

“去吃你的饭吧，吃过就会好受些。男人肚子饿的时候喜欢发牢骚。”乔说完飞步走出了前门。

“这是对‘我派’的‘标榜’。”劳里学着艾美的话回答，孝敬地陪爷爷进赔罪餐去了。此后一整天，老人心情奇佳，言谈举止也特别谦和体谅了。

大家都以为乌云散去，事情就此了结，可毕竟创伤已经无法弥补，别人可以忘了，美格却还记得。她从不跟人提及某人，可又常常想起他，也做了更多的梦。有一次，乔在姐姐的书桌里翻箱倒柜找邮票时，发现了一张小纸片，上面潦草地写满了“约翰·布鲁克太太”。乔见了悲叹着把它扔进了炉火中，觉得劳里的胡闹加快了那罪恶一天的到来。

第二十二章　怡人的芳草地


此后的几个礼拜相安无事，犹如暴风雨后阳光普照。两个病人都康复得很快，马奇先生来信提起，新年初就可以回家了。贝丝很快便可以整天躺在书房的沙发上玩乐，起初是跟那几只宠猫玩，后来便惦记起了缝洋娃娃的活计，工期已经延误，让人伤心。她那灵活的四肢如今变得僵硬无力，乔每天得奋臂把她抱到屋外透透空气。美格愉快地为乖乖女烹调各式美味伙食，把白皙的双手熏得黑糊糊的。而艾美，这位小圈子的忠实仆从，则费尽唇舌地劝说姐姐们接受她的宝藏，以庆祝她的回归。

圣诞节一天天临近了，屋里开始弥漫起一股惯常的神秘气氛。乔为这个不同寻常的快乐圣诞拼命献计献策，提出了许多完全不可能做到或荒唐无稽的庆祝活动，常常令全家人捧腹大笑。劳里同样脱离实际，竟然异想天开，要点篝火、放焰火、搭凯旋门。大家唇枪舌剑，各不相让，最后，那双雄心可嘉的朋友终于偃旗息鼓，绷着脸东奔西走，大家正以为他们已经歇菜了，却又看到两人凑到一起，一个劲儿地哈哈大笑。

几天来，天气异常温暖，正好预示着一个阳光灿烂的圣诞节。汉娜从骨子里感到圣诞节将是一个特别晴好的日子。她果然预测得好准，人人都心想事成，事事都进展顺利。首先，马奇先生来信说，他很快就要与家人团聚；其次，那天早上，贝丝身体感觉非常舒服，便穿上了妈妈的礼物——一件柔软的深红色美利奴羊毛大衣——被隆重背到窗前观看乔和劳里送的礼物。两位“无敌将军”为了使自己名副其实，宛如两个小精灵，通宵达旦，竟在一夜之间搞出了一个妙趣横生的奇迹。外面花园里竖起了一个高贵的白雪少女，头戴冬青花冠，一手挎着装满水果和鲜花的篮子，另一只手里拿着一大卷新乐谱。她冰冷的肩膀上围着一根五彩缤纷的阿富汗围巾，嘴上还挂着一首圣诞颂歌。歌词写在一面粉红色的纸幡上：





高山少女致贝丝





上帝保佑你，亲爱的贝丝女王！

在这圣诞节里，

愿你永不沮丧，

健康、平和、快乐，都属于你。





送上水果给勤劳缝纫女品尝，

鲜花让鼻子享用；

送上乐谱小钢琴上弹奏，

送上阿富汗披巾让她翩翩起舞。





喏，送上乔安娜的画像，

出自拉斐尔第二啊，

为了画得栩栩如生，

她可是不辞辛劳。





请笑纳一条红绸巾，

来点缀葩儿小姐的尾巴；

还有好阿美做的冰淇淋——

犹如桶装勃朗峰[1]。





我的塑造者把他们的挚爱

打进我冰雪的心胸：

请从乔和劳里的手中接过去

收下吧，连同这位阿尔卑斯少女。





贝丝见了，笑得开心极了，劳里跑上跑下运礼物，乔则滑稽可笑地发表致词，奉上礼物。

激动时刻过后，乔把贝丝抱到书房休息。贝丝吃着高山少女送的美味提子提神，心满意足地叹息道：“我感到太幸福了，只要爸爸在，我就满足了。”

“我也一样。”乔拍拍口袋，那里面装着她渴望已久的《水精灵》。

“我当然也一样。”艾美响应道。她正在端详母亲送的镶在精致画框中的版画《圣母和圣婴》。

“我也是！”美格叫道。她正在抚摸绸缎裙子的银闪闪的褶子，这是她平生第一件绸缎服装，是劳伦斯先生一定要送给她的。

“我又怎么不是呢？”马奇太太心中充满感激之情地说，她看看丈夫的来信，又看看贝丝的笑脸，轻轻抚摸着那枚刚刚由女儿们别在胸前，用灰色、金色、栗色和褐色头发做成的胸针。

在这个平淡无奇的世界上，偶尔会发生像小说里那样饶有趣味的事情，那该是多大的安慰。半小时前，大家说，全家很幸福，只差一件事就美满了，没想到，这好事就来了。劳里打开客厅的门，悄悄地探头进来。他好像刚翻了个筋斗，又像印第安人那样刚呐喊过，脸上洋溢着抑制不住的兴奋，声音也带着诡秘的喜悦，大家见了都跳了起来。他只是气喘吁吁，语气诡秘地说：“还有一件圣诞礼物，送给马奇一家。”

还没等把话说完，他就不知怎么闪开了。在他的位置上出现了一位男子，只见他高高的个子，头上用围巾包得严严实实，露出两只眼睛，由另一个高个子搀扶着。他想说点什么，可又没能说出口。大家蜂拥而上，好几分钟，跟发了疯一样，做出了最古里怪气的事，可谁都没讲一句话。四双充满浓浓爱意的手臂把马奇先生抱了个严严实实，乔差一点都要昏过去了，不得不被扶到瓷器储藏室接受劳里的治疗，这令她大为丢脸。布鲁克吻了一下美格，他吞吞吐吐地说完全是出于误会。艾美向来稳重，可这回却被凳子绊了一跤，也顾不得爬起来，就抱住爸爸的靴子大喊大叫，十分感人。马奇太太第一个回过神来，举起手警告大家：“嘘！别忘了贝丝在休息！”

可已经晚了，书房的门飞快地打开，门口出现了披红色晨衣的小人，喜悦给虚弱的四肢增添了力气，贝丝径直扑到了父亲怀里。这以后发生的事已不再重要，因为大家心头洋溢着快乐，它冲走了往日的苦涩，留下的尽是现在的甜蜜。

有件事不算浪漫，由衷的一笑使大家都清醒过来。她们看到汉娜站在门后，手里捧着一只肥大的火鸡，呜咽着。她刚才冲出来的时候，忘了把火鸡留在厨房里了。等笑声平息了下来，马奇太太便感谢布鲁克认真护理丈夫，这也让布鲁克突然想起马奇先生需要休息。他拉过劳里，匆匆告退了。接着，大家要两位病人休息，他们只得从命。他们坐在同一把大椅子上，聊个不停。

马奇先生说，早就想给大家一个惊喜，天气一放晴，就得到医生允许，趁此机会出院。他谈起了布鲁克悉心的照料，是一位多么正直、可敬的年轻人。马奇先生说到这里停了下来，瞟了一眼美格，只见她正在使劲地捅炉火。他接着又满脸疑惑地皱起眉头，看了看妻子，至于他为什么这样，读者心知肚明。还有，马奇太太微微地点了点头，突然问丈夫要吃点什么，至于这又是为什么，也留给读者去猜想。乔见到这神色，马上就明白了，于是她沉着脸去取葡萄酒和牛肉汤，一边砰地关上门，一边顾自嘟哝着：“我恨死了棕色眼睛的年轻人！有什么可敬的？”

从来没有吃过那么丰盛的圣诞大餐。汉娜端上来的大火鸡，真是一道奇观。火鸡肚子里塞着满满的作料，外皮烤得棕黄，而且还点缀了蔬菜。葡萄干布丁也引得人口水直流，放到嘴里就化掉了。还有果子冻，艾美陶醉得像一只掉进蜜罐里的苍蝇。一切都是那么美好，真是上天保佑。汉娜说：“太太，我刚才真是昏了头，幸亏，我没有烤布丁，没有把葡萄干塞到火鸡里头，更不用说把火鸡包在布里炙（煮），真是个寄（奇）迹。”

劳伦斯先生祖孙俩过府来共进大餐，布鲁克先生也在座——乔恶狠狠瞪着他，逗得劳里乐不可支。贝丝和父亲并排坐在桌子正座的两把安乐椅上，只吃一点点鸡肉和水果。他们为健康而干杯，讲故事、唱歌，还有回首往事，真是一段无限美妙的时光。姑娘们本来打算去乘雪橇，可不愿离开父亲，客人们早早就告辞了。夜幕降临，幸福的一家子围坐在炉火边。

大家尽情地聊天，随后是一段短暂的沉默。乔先开口了：“就在一年前，也是平安夜，我们个个都在发牢骚，抱怨倒霉的圣诞节来临。还记得吗？”

“这一年总的说来还算顺利！”美格面对炉火满脸笑容地说，庆幸自己体面地招待了布鲁克先生。

“我觉得这一年挺苦的。”艾美说着，看着自己闪闪发光的戒指，两眼若有所思。

“总算过去了，我很高兴，因为把您盼回来了。”贝丝坐在父亲的腿上，轻声说道。

“你们走的路确实不平坦，小朝圣者们，特别是后半段。可你们勇敢面对，我相信，不久你们的担子就能落地。”马奇先生慈祥地看着围坐着的四张小脸，满意地说。

“您是怎么知道的？妈妈跟您说的吗？”乔问。

“没说多少，草动知风向嘛，我今天就有一些发现。”

“哦，跟我们说说是哪些！”坐在身边的美格喊道。

“这里就有一个！”他拿起一只放在椅子扶手上的手，指点着粗糙的食指、手背上一点烫伤的疤，还有手掌上的两三个老茧，“我还记得，这手以前是又白又嫩，你最关心的就是保养它。那时确实很美，可在我看来，现在更美——因为透过这些表面的瑕疵，我可以知道一个个故事。对名利场进行了一次燃烧燔祭嘛，这硬结的手掌赢得的远不止是水疱。我相信，这些针刺累累的手指做出的针线活一定很耐用，因为针针线线都包含了良好的祝福。美格，乖乖，比起那些白皙的手和时髦的才艺，我更看重这种妇人的手艺，因为它能为家庭带来幸福。能握一下这善良、勤劳的小手，我感到自豪，真希望不会很快有人恳求我放掉它[2]。”

如果美格长期的耐心劳作需要回报的话，那么在父亲有力的握手和赞许的笑容里，她已经得到了一切。

“那乔呢？请夸她一下。她也那么辛苦，对我又那么好。”贝丝在父亲耳边嘀咕。

他笑着，往坐在对面的高个女孩看去，只见棕色的脸上带着异常温柔的神情。

“尽管留着一头短鬈发，可看不到一年前离开时的那个乔小子了。”马奇先生说，“我看到的是一位年轻小姐，领头别得挺直，鞋带系得整齐，不吹口哨，不说土话，也不像以前那样躺在地毯上了。现在又护理又操心，脸都变得消瘦苍白，可我喜欢看，因为这样更文气。嗓门也没那么大了，不再蹦蹦跳跳，走路也文雅了，还能像妈妈一样照顾某个小孩了，我真高兴。很想念那个野姑娘，可要是代之以坚强、乐于助人、心地善良的妇人，我会非常满意。不知道我家爱捣蛋的黑绵羊[3]是不是因为剪了毛而变得文静，可我敢肯定，找遍整个首都，都没有一样好东西，值得用乖女儿捎来的二十五元买下来。”

听罢父亲的夸奖，乔那明亮的双眼一时有点模糊，消瘦的脸蛋在火光映照下变得红润起来，心里觉得自己是该被夸奖一下。

“现在该轮到贝丝了。”艾美说。她渴望轮到自己，可她愿意等。

“对她没什么可说的，怕说多了她要溜走。不过她已经不像过去那样害羞了。”父亲乐呵呵地说。一想到自己差一点就失去了她，父亲抱紧贝丝，脸紧贴在一起。他体贴地说：“总算没事了，我的贝丝，我要你平平安安，愿上帝保佑。”

在片刻沉默之后，父亲低头看着坐在脚边矮凳上的艾美，摸着她发亮的头发说：

“我发现，艾美吃饭的时候，吃鸡腿了，整个下午都在给妈妈跑腿，今天晚上又给美格让座，耐心地为大家服务，而且也很乐意这么做。我也看到她不再烦恼，也不照镜子了，也不炫耀手上的漂亮戒指。所以我敢肯定，她已经学会了多为别人着想，少为自己考虑，下定决心培养自己的优秀品格，跟她塑造小泥人一样用心。为此，我很高兴。我为她塑造出优美雕像感到自豪，更为有这样一个可爱的女儿，一个有才干为己为人创造美丽人生的女儿，而感到无比自豪。”

“你在想什么，贝丝？”当艾美谢过父亲并介绍了戒指的来历后，乔问。

“今天我读《天路历程》，读到基督徒和希望徒排除万难，来到一片长年开满百合花的怡人的芳草地，在那儿愉快地歇息，如我们现在一样，然后继续向目的地挺进。”贝丝答道，一面从父亲的臂膀中溜脱出来，慢慢走到钢琴前说，“唱圣歌时间到了，我想回到老位子。我来试唱朝圣者们听到的那首牧童歌。爸爸喜欢这歌词，我特地为他谱了曲。”

说着，贝丝坐到宝贝钢琴前，轻轻触动琴键，边弹边唱。那柔美的声音恍如隔世之音，他们以为再也无缘听到了。这首古雅的赞美诗仿佛专为她而作：





位卑者无惧跌落，

低贱者无需自尊；

卑下者心中，

自有上帝做引导。





我心常知足，

贫富不能移；

主呵！我求知足乐，

只因此乐主珍惜。





漫漫朝圣旅，

担子蛮沉重；

此生微小，来世极乐，

生生世世最快乐！

第二十三章　姑婆解决问题


第二天，母女几个围着马奇先生团团转，宛如蜜蜂簇拥着蜂王。她们把一切都抛到脑后，只管伺候这位新到的病人，注视着他，听他说话，使他招架不住，真是好心也杀人。他仰卧在贝丝坐的沙发旁边的一把大椅子里，其他三个姑娘围在身边，汉娜不时地探头进来，偷偷地看一眼亲人，大家其乐融融，一切都显得完美无缺。可家里就是缺了点什么，大人们都觉察到了，不过谁都不愿承认。马奇夫妇用目光追随着美格，焦躁地面面相觑。乔有时突然严肃起来，还看到她对着布鲁克先生留在过道里的伞挥拳头。美格心不在焉，羞得一言不发，一听到门铃响就心惊肉跳，一听到约翰的名字就满脸通红。艾美说：“大家好像都在等什么，坐立不安，这就奇怪了，爸爸都已经平安到家了。”贝丝天真地纳闷，她家的邻居怎么突然不来了。

下午劳里路过，看到美格坐在窗边，仿佛一下子心血来潮，单膝跪在雪地上，捶胸扯发，还哀求地抱拳，犹如乞讨什么恩典。美格叫他放尊重一点，命他走开，他又用手帕绞出几滴假泪，然后摇摇晃晃转身而去，仿佛伤心欲绝。

“那憨头鹅是什么意思？”美格笑着明知故问。

“他在向你示范，你的约翰以后会怎么做。感人吧？”乔奚落道。

“别说我的约翰，这不礼貌，也并非事实。”但美格的声音却恋恋不舍这几个字，仿佛听起来很悦耳，“请不要烦我了，乔，跟你说过的，我对他并没有怎么，这事也没什么可说的，还像以前一样朋友来往。”

“我们可办不到啊，都已经说出口了的。对于我来说，劳里的恶作剧已毁了你。我看出来了，妈妈也一样。你一点也不像过去的你，似乎离我那么遥远。我不想烦你，而且会像男子汉一样承受此事，但我很想把它解决掉。我痛恨等待，所以如果你真有意的话，就请抓紧时间，赶快了断。”乔没好气地说。

“他不开口，我可没法乱说乱动，而他不会说的，因为爸爸说我还太小。”美格一面说，一面低着头做活，脸上露出一丝异样的微笑，表明在这一点上不苟同父亲的意见。

“要是他真的开口了，你会不知道怎么说好，只会哭鼻子，脸红，让他遂心如意，而不是好好地、坚决地说一声‘不’。”

“我可不是你想象的那么傻，那么软弱。我知道该说什么的，已经计划好了，免得措手不及。谁也不知道会发生什么事，我希望自己有备无患。”

看到姐姐不知不觉摆出一副煞有介事的神气，就像脸颊上两朵美丽的红晕，变幻不定，十分好看，乔禁不住微笑起来。

“不介意告诉我你会说什么吗？”乔肃然起敬地问。

“不介意。你也十六岁了，完全可以参与我的心事，再说你以后要碰到这种事情，我的经验或许会对你有用。”

“不打算碰到的。看别人谈情说爱倒是挺带劲的，但自己坠入情网时，我会觉得愚不可及。”乔说。想到这，她不觉惊恐万状。

“我看不会的，如果你很喜欢一个人，而他也喜欢你的话。”美格仿佛在自言自语，说完向外面的小巷望去。夏日黄昏时，她常常看到恋人们在这里双双散步的。

“我想你是准备把这番话告诉那个男人吧。”乔不客气地打断姐姐的遐想。

“哦，我只会平静、干脆地说：‘谢谢你，布鲁克先生，你的心意我领了，但我和爸爸都认为我还太年轻，目前不宜订婚。此事请不要再提，咱们还是一样做朋友吧。'”

“哼！真够刚强、够漂亮！我不信你会这样说，我看即使说了他也不会甘心。如果他像小说里头那些失恋者一样纠缠不休，你就会答应他，而不愿伤害他的感情。”

“不会的。我会告诉他我主意已定，然后很有尊严地退出房间。”

美格说着站起来，正准备排练那尊严告退的一幕，过道里却传来脚步声。她飞快地坐到座位上，做起了针线活，仿佛有人给规定了时间，要缝完才能活命。见到这个突变，乔强忍着笑。听到有人轻轻地敲门，乔板着脸开了门，那样子很不客气。

“下午好。我来拿伞——也顺便看看你爸今天怎样了。”布鲁克先生说，看着两张爱憎分明的脸，心里有点迷惑不解。

“很好，爸爸在搁架上，我去拿，跟伞说你来了。”乔回答时把父亲和雨伞张冠李戴了。她悄悄溜出房，让美格有机会表明心迹、保持尊严。可是，乔一走，美格就侧身往门口走，低声说：“妈妈想见你，请坐，我去叫她。”

“请别走，你怕我吗，玛格丽特？”布鲁克先生一副痛心的神情，以致美格以为自己一定做了很无礼的事。她立刻满脸通红，布鲁克从来都不叫她玛格丽特的，同时也感到惊奇万分，怎么听他叫会这么自然，这么动听。她急于显得友好、自在，伸手做了个信赖的姿势，感激地说：“你对爸爸那么好，我怎么会怕呢？只想着要好好谢你呢。”

“要不要告诉你怎么谢吗？”布鲁克问，双手一把抓住美格的小手，低头看着她，棕色的眼睛里充满了浓浓的爱意。美格心跳得厉害，她既想逃开，又想留下来听个明白。

“不要，请别这样——还是别告诉吧。”她说着试图把手抽回来。尽管她不承认，可还是显得很害怕。

“我不会找你麻烦的，美格，只想知道，你是不是对我有点好感。乖乖，我是那么爱你。”接着布鲁克含情脉脉地说。

到时候了，该冷静地说那番正经话了，可美格没开口。她已经忘得一干二净，只低着头回答：“不知道呀。”说得那么轻，约翰不得不弯下腰才能听见这傻乎乎的回答。

他似乎觉得这个麻烦很值得，满意地顾自笑了笑，感激地紧握那只胖乎乎的手，诚挚地劝道：“你愿意设法弄明白吗？我很想知道，要弄清楚我最终能否得到奖赏，才能安心工作。”

“我太小了。”美格支支吾吾地说，纳闷怎么会这么心绪不宁，可心里还是暗自高兴。

“我可以等，与此同时，你可以学会喜欢我。这门课程是否很难呢，乖乖？”

“如果想学就不难，不过——”

“那就学吧，美格。我乐意教，这可比德语容易。”约翰打断她，把她另一只手也握住，这样她的脸便无处可藏，他可以弯下腰来端详了。

他的口气简直在恳求了，但美格含羞偷偷看了他一眼，却看到那含情脉脉的眼睛里藏着快活，脸上一丝胸有成竹的微笑，十分得意。这使美格不觉恼火起来。此刻，她的脑海里浮现出安妮·莫法特教给她的愚蠢的卖俏邀宠课程，沉睡于大部分小妇人内心深处的支配欲在心中幡然觉醒，令她失去自制。她感到激动，她感到古怪，一时手足无措，仿佛心血来潮，竟把双手抽出，大惊小怪地说：“我不想学。请走开。别烦我！”

可怜的布鲁克先生大惊失色，仿佛他那漂亮的空中楼阁在耳边轰然倒塌。他以前从来没见过美格发这样的脾气，心中不觉糊涂起来。

“你说的是真话？”他焦急地问，一边跟着拔腿就走的美格。

“不假。我不想为这种事烦恼。爸爸说我没必要。太早了，我还不想。”

“请问，你会慢慢改变主意吗？我会等，等你考虑考虑再说。别戏弄我，美格。我想你也不会那样的。”

“对我千万别抱什么想法。”美格说。一句话既逞了自己的威风，又考验了情郎的耐心，她心中产生一股淘气的满足感。

他脸色阴沉下来，变得煞白，神态极像她所崇拜的小说主人公，但他既没有学他们拍额头，也没有在房间里踱步。他只是痴痴站在那儿，温情脉脉地看着她，她心里不由得软了下来。如果不是马奇姑婆在这有趣的当儿一瘸一拐地走进来，接下来会发生什么，就不得而知了。

老太太在户外透气，碰到了劳里，得知马奇先生已经回来了，她忍不住要看看侄子，就马上乘马车来看他。一家人都在后屋忙碌，她轻手轻脚地进来，希望给他们一个冷不防。她确实使其中的两位颇感意外，美格仿佛看到了鬼，吓了一跳，布鲁克先生则马上退入书房。

“天哪，这到底是怎么回事？”老太太看看脸色苍白的年轻人，又瞧瞧满脸通红的美格，把手杖一叩，大声喊道。

“那是爸爸的朋友。我被您吓了一跳！”美格结结巴巴地说，觉得自己这下又要好好地被训一顿了。

“显而易见的嘛。”姑婆边坐下边回答，“可你爸爸的朋友说了什么，让你脸红得像朵牡丹？里面肯定有鬼，我一定要搞清楚。”手杖又敲了一下。

“我们只是在聊天。布鲁克先生是来拿伞的。”美格开口了，但愿布鲁克先生已经拿着伞平安地走了。

“布鲁克？就是那男孩的家庭教师？啊，我明白了。我什么都知道了。乔在读你爸爸的一封信时，无意中说漏了嘴，我让她说了出来。孩子，你还没有答应他吧？”姑婆生气地喊道。

“嘘！他会听到的。要我把妈妈叫来吗？”美格心烦意乱地说。

“还不用。我要跟你说些事，必须一吐为快。告诉我，你想嫁给这个库克[1]？要是真的，我可一分钱都不会传给你。记住了，放明白一点。”老太太威严地说。

姑婆擅长激起那些温顺之人的逆反心理，并以此为乐。我们多数人骨子里都有一点任性，年轻的恋人们更是如此。如果姑婆恳求美格，要她接受约翰·布鲁克，美格可能会宣布她连考虑都不会考虑。可要是有人断然要求她不要喜欢约翰，她却马上会铁了心要喜欢他。倾慕加上任性使美格轻易就做出了决定。美格显得非常激动，以非凡的勇气拒绝了老太太。

“我爱嫁谁就嫁给谁，姑婆，把钱爱传谁就传给谁吧。”她说着坚定地点点头。

“放肆！我可是好意，你就这样对我，小姐？到草房里做你的爱情梦去吧，你会明白什么叫失败，到时会后悔莫及的。”

“总不会比豪宅业主的爱情差吧？”美格反驳道。

姑婆戴上眼镜，仔细地端详美格，从没见过这姑娘这样生气过。美格也几乎不认识自己了，只觉得自己是那么勇敢、自立——能维护约翰，随意宣示自己爱他的权利，令她很高兴。姑婆发现自己出师不利，沉默片刻之后，她又另起炉灶，尽量温和地说：“好了，美格，好孩子，别乱来，听我的话。我是为你好，不想看到你第一步走错，毁了一生。你要嫁个有钱人，帮帮你的家。嫁给有钱人，是你的责任，你应该刻骨铭心。”

“爸爸妈妈不会这么想的。他们知道约翰没钱，可还是喜欢他。”

“我的宝贝，你父母跟小孩子一样，不懂什么世故。”

“我就喜欢这样。”美格决不屈服。

姑婆没在意，继续开导她：“这个鲁克没钱，连个有钱的亲戚都没有，是吧？”

“是的，可他有很多热心的朋友。”

“你们不能光靠朋友度日。试试看吧，朋友会变得多么冷淡。他没职业，对吗？”

“还没有。劳伦斯先生会帮他的。”

“这不是什么长久之计。詹姆斯·劳伦斯是个喜怒无常的怪老头，不可靠。那你打算跟这么个人结婚啰？一个没钱、没地位也没职业的人。你打算干得比现在更苦啊。其实，听我的话，好好做人，日子会过得很舒服的！美格，我原来以为你是明白人。”

“哪怕等上下半辈子，我也无法更好地做人！约翰很聪明，是个人才，勤劳肯干，肯定能干一番事业。他精力充沛，而且敢作敢为，大家都喜欢他，尊重他。我一个小姑娘家，没钱，什么都不懂，可他喜欢我，我感到很自豪。”美格说话真挚，显得比以往更加美丽动人。

“他可知道你有阔亲戚的，孩子，我猜，这是他喜欢你的奥秘。”

“姑婆，你怎么敢这么说？约翰不会这么卑鄙，要是你再这么说，我可不听了。”美格愤怒地喊道，这时她已忘记了一切，脑海里只有老太太不公正的猜测，“我的约翰不会为了钱结婚，我也不会。我们都肯干，愿意等。没钱我不怕，你看，我现在不是一直很幸福嘛。我相信，跟他在一起会幸福，因为他爱我，我——”

美格没有说下去，突然想起自己还未下决心，她刚才已经要“她的约翰”走开。他可能无意中会听到自己前后矛盾的话。

姑婆十分懊恼，她一心要为漂亮的侄孙女找一份美满姻缘，可姑娘年轻开心的脸上的神情使老太太感到伤心，气不打一处来。

“好吧，这事我可撒手不管了！你这个任性的丫头。尽做蠢事，你失去了很多，有些你甚至还不知道。不，我不耽搁了。对你很失望，没心思再看你爸爸了。出嫁时就别指望了，我什么都不给。你的布克先生有那么多朋友，他们会照顾你的。我跟你到此完了。”

然后，姑婆当着美格的面把门砰地关上，怒气冲冲地驱车走了。她仿佛把美格的全部勇气也卷走了，姑娘独自一个人站着发呆，不知道该笑还是哭。她还没回过神来，布鲁克先生就一把抱住她，一口气说道：“我不是有意偷听，美格。谢谢你替我说话。我也要谢谢马奇姑婆，她证实了你真的有点喜欢我。”

“要是她不骂你，我也不知道我是多么喜欢你的。”美格说。

“我不用再走了吧，可以留下来快活吗，乖乖？”

这时本来又是一个好机会，美格可以发表决定性的讲话，然后体面地开脱。但美格从来都没有想过这么做，只是把脸靠在布鲁克的马甲上，温顺地喃喃道：“行，约翰。”这使她在乔面前永远都抬不起头来。

在姑婆离去一刻钟之后，乔轻轻走下楼梯，在大厅门口站一下，听到里头没有声音，便满意地点点头，笑着自语道：“她已按计划把他打发走了，此事已经了断。让我去听听这件趣事，痛痛快快笑一场。”

不过，可怜的乔永远也没笑成，她刚踏上门槛便怔住了。眼前的情景，使她的嘴巴张得巨大，圆瞪着的眼睛也几乎有那么大。她本来要进去为退敌而欢庆一番，称赞姐姐意志坚强，把要不得的情郎逐出家门，不料，却看见那位仇敌安详地坐在沙发上，而意志坚强的姐姐则端坐在他的膝上，脸上是一副天底下最卑鄙的百依百顺的表情。真是触目惊心啊。乔猛吸了一口冷气，犹如一盆冷洗澡水劈头泼下——形势急转直下，实在出乎意料，她不禁呼吸急促起来。听到奇怪的响声，那对恋人回过头来，看到了她。美格跳起来，神情既骄傲又腼腆，但那个男人，乔这样称呼他，竟自笑了起来，吻了吻惊得目瞪口呆的不速之客，冷静地说道：“乔妹妹，祝贺我们吧！”

这无异于伤害又加侮辱——实在太过分了——乔恼羞成怒，两手狠狠一甩，一声不吭地消失了。她跑上楼，闯进房间，痛心疾首地大叫，把两位病人吓了一跳：

“哎哟，谁快下楼来呀。约翰·布鲁克在做见不得人的事，美格还很高兴！”

马奇夫妇飞快地冲出房间。乔扑倒在床上，一边痛哭一边痛骂着，把这个可怕的消息告诉贝丝和艾美。不过，两位小妹妹却觉得这是件快事，还很有趣。乔未得到她们的同情，便躲上了阁楼，把满腹的牢骚向几只小老鼠倾诉。

没人知道那天下午客厅里发生的事。可大家聊了许多，一向不善言语的布鲁克先生滔滔不绝，这使朋友们都颇感诧异。他还热切地求婚，讲了他的打算，又说服大家一切都按他的想法来办。

喝茶的铃声响了，布鲁克还没讲完，正在描绘自己设想为美格创造的乐园。他自豪地陪同美格入席吃晚饭，两人都显得无比幸福。乔无心嫉妒，也无心沮丧。艾美被约翰的真情和美格的高贵深深地打动。贝丝远远地望着他们笑，马奇夫妇满意地、深情地审视着这对年轻人，毫无疑问，姑婆称他们“一对不懂事的孩子”一点没错。大家都吃得不多，可都显得兴高采烈。家里有了第一件罗曼史，简直蓬荜生辉。

“现在，你不能说高兴事从来不进家门了吧，美格？”艾美一边问，一边盘算构思，如何把这对恋人双双画进画中。

“对，肯定不能这样说。我说这话以来，发生了多少事情啊！好像是一年前的事了吧。”美格回答。她此刻正在做着远远超越了面包黄油这类俗物的美梦。

“这次是欢乐紧跟悲伤而来，我倒以为转机开始出现了。”马奇太太说，“很多家庭不时会遇上多事之秋，这一年便发生了许多事情，但毕竟结局总算不错。”

“但愿来年的结局更好。”乔咕哝道。看到美格当着她的面迷恋一个陌生人，她心里难以接受。乔对一些人爱得颇深，唯恐会失去他们的爱，唯恐情意会浅下去。

“我希望从今年开始的第三年会有一个更好的结局。我看这是势在必行的，只要我能够实施自己的计划。”布鲁克先生笑微微地望着美格说，仿佛现在对于他来说，一切都成为可能的了。

“等三年是不是太久了？”艾美问，恨不得婚礼立即举行。

“我还有许多东西要学，还嫌准备时间显得太短呢。”美格回答，甜甜的脸上露出一种前所未有的严肃劲。

“等着就行了，活嘛我来干。”约翰说干就干，捡起美格的餐巾，脸上的表情令乔直摇脑袋。这时，前门砰地响了一声，乔松了一口气，自忖道：“劳里来了。我们终于可以谈点正经事了。”

但乔想错了。只见劳里心花怒放地跑进来，手里捧着一大束喜花送给“约翰·布鲁克太太”。他显然还执迷不悟，错把自己的乖巧张罗当成了这桩好事的促成要素。

“我早就知道，布鲁克一定心想事成的，他一向如此。只要他下定决心要做一件事，天塌下来也能做好。”劳里把花和祝词献上。

“承蒙夸奖，不胜感激。我把这话当作一个好兆头，这里就邀请你参加婚礼。”布鲁克先生答。他待人一向平和，连调皮捣蛋的学生也不例外。

“我即使远在天边也要赶回来参加，单单乔那天的脸色就值得我长途跋涉回来一看的啦。你好像不大高兴呢，小姐。怎么回事？”劳里一面问，一面跟着乔，和众人一起来到客厅一角迎接劳伦斯先生。

“我不赞成这婚配，但我已决定把它忍下来，一句坏话也不说。”乔严肃地说。“你不会明白的，失去美格有多么难受，”她接着说，声音微微颤抖。

“你并不是失去她，只是与人分享而已。”劳里安慰道。

“再也不会一样了。我失去了至亲至爱的朋友。”乔叹息道。

“但你有我呢。你看，我虽一事无成，但一定会和你在一起的，一生一世。一定！我发誓！”劳里说话算话的。

“我知道你一定会的，我千恩万谢。你总是给我带来莫大的安慰，特迪。”乔答道，感激地握着劳里的手。

“好了，别愁眉苦脸的啦，好孩子。这事其实并没有什么不好。美格感到幸福，布鲁克跑动一下，很快就能安定下来的。爷爷会照顾他。看到美格住自己的小窝，该是多么快活。她走后我们会过得十分开心的。我很快就读完大学的，届时我们结伴出国，好好游览一下。这样你心里舒服了吧？”

“但愿如此。但谁知道这三年里会发生什么事情呢。”乔心事重重地说。

“那倒是的。难道你不想向前看，想象一下我们大家到那时有什么进展吗？我可想的。”劳里回答。

“不看也罢，我怕看到伤心事。现在大家都这么高兴，我想将来也不会更上一层楼的。”乔说着把房间慢慢扫视一遍，眼睛随之一亮，那边是风景独好。

父母亲坐在一起，静静地重温约二十年前初恋时的情景。艾美正在为那对情侣作画，他们坐在一边，沉醉在自己的美妙世界里，脸上闪着上帝恩宠的光辉，这是小画家所不能描摹的。贝丝躺在沙发上，与老朋友愉快地交谈。劳伦斯先生握着她的小手，觉得它好像具有一股力量，能引导他与她平静地同行。乔懒洋洋地躺在她最喜欢的矮椅子上，神色黯然而平静，这恰好是她自己的风格。劳里靠在她的椅子背上，下巴贴着乔的鬈发，笑容可掬，面对映着两人的长镜子，朝乔点点头。

人物聚齐，可以落幕，美格、乔、贝丝和艾美的故事也告一段落。帷幕是否再次拉起，全仰仗各位读者是否接受《小妇人》这部家庭剧的第一幕了。

第二十四章　闲聊


故事重新开讲，还是先聊一些马奇家的事，然后轻松参加美格的婚礼。这里请允许我澄清一点，如果年岁大的读者觉得故事里写了太多有关谈情说爱的内容，恐怕他们会提出（倒不怕年轻读者提出）这种异议。我只能用马奇太太的话说：“我家有四位快乐的姑娘，那边还有一位潇洒的小伙子做邻居，你们会期望发生别的故事呢？”

三年过去了，平静的家里没有多大变化。战争已经结束，马奇先生平安地待在家里，整天为小教区的事务忙碌，一有空便埋头读书。他的性格和风度都让人觉得，他天生就是个牧师——沉默寡言，勤劳肯干，富有书本里学不到的智慧，善心广博，认为四海皆兄弟，生性虔诚，却让人敬畏爱戴。

虽然贫穷和正直的天性使他无缘于世俗名利，但这些优点使许多好人都亲近他，如芳草吸引蜜蜂般顺理成章。同样，他给予他们的花蜜凝聚着五十年饱经风霜的经历，却没有半点苦涩。兢兢业业的年轻人发现，这位满头白发的学者，心跟他们一样年轻；妇女有心事或遇到麻烦的，本能地向他倾诉疑惑和忧伤，相信能在他那里得到最体贴的同情和最明智的忠告；罪人们把罪孽向这位心地纯洁的老人忏悔，以获得训诫和拯救；天才们把他视作知音；有进取心的人在他那里找到了更高尚的抱负；连那些凡夫俗子都承认，他的信仰既真且美，虽然没有回报任何物质上的实惠。

在外人看来，马奇家是由五个精力旺盛的女人做主。在很多事务中，她们确实如此。虽然沉默寡言的学者埋在书堆里，可他还是一家之主、精神支柱和安慰者。每当遇到麻烦时，忙碌不安的妇人总会向他求助，她们发现丈夫和父亲这两个神圣的称呼对他真是名副其实。

姑娘们把心都交给了母亲保管，把灵魂交给了父亲保管。对于忠诚地为女儿们生活、劳作的父母，她们给予的是爱，这种爱随着年龄的增长与日俱增。爱赐福生，超越死，如同一根无限美好的纽带，把他们温柔地牵在一起。

马奇太太虽然比以前看起来苍老多了，可还是像过去那样精力充沛，乐观开朗。现在她正忙于张罗美格的婚事，医院和收容所的事也就无暇顾及。毫无疑问，济济一堂的伤员和烈属遗孀们都渴望着这位母亲传教士的探望。

约翰·布鲁克勇敢地服了一年役，受伤回家，没有再让他上战场。领章上没有加星，肩章上也没有加杠，可他问心无愧，因为他不顾一切，毅然投身战场。值此生命和爱情之花开得正艳时，这难能宝贵。约翰完全服从退役的安排，全身心投入身体的恢复，并准备找个工作，为美格挣回一个家。他的特点是有见识，坚决不依赖人，所以拒绝了劳伦斯先生多项慷慨的特邀，而接受了记账员的工作。他觉得一开始老老实实挣薪水比贷款冒险要踏实得多。

美格在期待中工作，变得女人味十足，操持家务的本领日益完善，人也越发美丽动人。可见，爱情是一种超凡的美容品。她满怀少女的憧憬和希望，可想到新生活必须以卑微的方式开始，心中不免有几分失落。内德·莫法特刚娶了萨莉·加德纳，美格忍不住要拿他们豪宅香车、大量的礼物、亮丽华服进行攀比，并且暗自希望自己也来一份。可当她想起，约翰为这个小家不辞辛劳，付出了无限真爱，她心中的羡慕和不满顿时烟消云散。当他们坐在暮色中讨论家庭小计划时，前途总是变得那么美好而光明，美格也就忘记萨莉的荣华富贵，只觉得自己是基督教世界最富有、最幸福的姑娘。

乔没有再回到马奇姑婆家，老太太喜欢上了艾美，为了收买她，甚至提出要为她延请当今最好的绘画老师教她。为了实现这种好事，艾美在所不惜，即使再难缠的老太太也会去服侍。她早上当差，下午享乐，日子过得不错。乔则全身心地投入文学创作，同时照顾贝丝。虽然猩红热早已成为过去，贝丝身体还是很虚。她已经不能算病人，可再也不能像以前那样脸色红润、体健身轻。不过，贝丝还是心情开朗，充满希望，宁静而安详，整天都默默地忙于自己喜欢的工作。她是家里的天使，大家的朋友，那些至爱亲友到后来才慢慢地认识到这一点。

只要《展翅的雄鹰》刊登她所谓的“垃圾”，然后每一栏支付一元钱，乔就觉得自己是富婆，并且努力撰写她的传奇故事。不过，她忙碌的脑袋雄心勃勃，酝酿着众多宏伟计划。阁楼上的旧铁柜里，满是墨迹的手稿在渐渐增厚，总有一天，会使马奇的名字载入名人录的。

劳里为了讨爷爷欢心，乖乖地上了大学。同时，为了使自己高兴，他尽量用最轻松的方式完成学业。他资质聪明、举止优雅，又出手大方，因此人缘很好。可他心地善良，常常为了帮助别人，反而自己陷入困境，他正面临着被宠坏的危险。就像许多前途无量的年轻人那样，他本来可能早就被惯坏了，幸亏有个辟邪的护身符，在他记忆深处铭刻着一位慈祥老人，一心要确保他成功，还有那位慈母般的益友，把他当成亲生儿子监护。最后，当然也是最重要的，他明白，有四位天真的姑娘，她们衷心地爱他、敬仰他、信任他。

劳里只是一个“食人间烟火的好小伙”，当然，他也嬉闹、调情、追逐时髦，有时他也感情用事、随波逐流、爱好体育，这也难怪，大学里的潮流就是如此。他捉弄人也被人捉弄，满嘴俚语，不止一次差点就被停学，甚至开除。可由于这些恶作剧都是源于一时兴起和喜欢寻开心，他总能坦诚地承认错误、体面地改过自新，要么凭借他炉火纯青的口才说得人不得不信服。其实，他为自己能侥幸逃脱感到自鸣得意，喜欢向姑娘们绘声绘色地描绘，他是如何成功地战胜愤怒的导师们、尊贵的教授们，还有那些手下败将。在姑娘们的眼里，“班上的男生们”都是英雄，她们对这大男子汉的战绩百听不厌。劳里经常带同学到家里，于是她们也常能领受这些大人物的笑脸恩泽。

艾美特别欣赏这份荣耀，成了他们中间的大美人，因为这位小姐很早就体会到，也开始学会如何运用她天生的魅力。美格过于迷恋她的专宠约翰，对其他爷们都不屑一顾。贝丝太腼腆，只敢偷偷地朝他们瞥上几眼，心里还纳闷，艾美怎么敢这么把他们弄得团团转。可乔却感到得心应手，她情不自禁地模仿起绅士的姿态、说话和举止。在她看来，这些可比那些小姐礼节要自然多了。男孩子们都非常喜欢乔，可不会爱上她。当然，面对艾美的神龛，很少有人能不献上一两声满怀深情的叹息而全身而退的。说到深情，很自然我们便想到了“斑鸠房”。

那可是布鲁克先生为美格准备的新家，是一座棕色的小房子。劳里给它取了这个名字，说这对温情脉脉的恋人来说正合适。他们“就像一对斑鸠在一起生活，先是接吻，接着便是唧唧地说情话”。这是一座小房子，屋后有一个小花园，屋前有一块手帕大小的草坪。美格打算在这里建一个喷水池，栽些灌木，再种上大批可爱的鲜花。不过，目前的喷水池只是一个饱经风霜的水缸，很像破旧的泔水盆；灌木丛是几株落叶松幼苗，也不知道能不能成活；各种鲜花只是插上一些树枝，表示那里埋了种子。屋子里面却是一派迷人的景象，从阁楼到地下室，开心的新娘都觉得无可挑剔。当然，过道很窄，幸亏他们也没有钢琴，因为谁都别想把整架钢琴抬进去；餐厅很小，六个人就拥挤不堪；厨房的楼道似乎专门是为把仆人连同瓷器乱七八糟地堆入煤箱而设。可一旦习惯了这些小缺憾，也就感到一切都是那么完美，因为屋子里的摆设处处都显示出品味和情趣，终究令人心满意足。没有大理石铺面的桌子，没有落地的穿衣镜，小客厅里也没有花边窗帘，有的只是简单的家具，丰富的藏书和一两幅美丽的图画，还有窗台上的一簇鲜花。漂亮的礼物散放在房间里，朋友们送的，带来了他们的深情厚谊，因而格外赏心悦目。

劳里送的是一尊伯利安白瓷普绪喀[1]，约翰把它的架子分开搁在一边，可这丝毫无损于它的美。艾美富有艺术感，她为新房装饰了朴素的纱布窗帘，显得优雅别致，这是任何装饰商都无法做到的。乔和母亲把美格为数不多的几个箱子、大桶和包袱一起放进储藏室，连同她们的美好祝福、快乐寄语和幸福热望都一起放进去，我想再没有比这间储藏室更丰富的了。汉娜把厨房里的锅碗瓢盆排列了十几遍，一切准备妥当，等布鲁克太太回家随时可以生火。要没有汉娜的辛勤劳作，我敢确信，这个簇新的厨房不会这么舒适、整齐。我也怀疑，有哪个年轻的主妇开始新生活前会有这么多抹布、容器、碎布袋，因为贝丝准备了很多，足够美格用到银婚典礼。而且她又发明了三种不同的洗碗布，专门用来擦洗新娘的瓷器。

那些雇人做这些事的人，永远都不会明白他们失去了什么，不要说这是居家最平凡的事，可要是由那些爱意浓浓的手来做，就会变得美妙无比。美格深有感触，在她这个小窝里，从厨房的卷筒毛巾到客厅桌子上的银花瓶，一切都凝聚着亲人的爱心和周到的计划。

一起筹划时，度过了多么美好的时光！购置嫁妆时，又是多么郑重其事！她们犯了多么愚蠢的错误！看到劳里买来的可笑便宜货，她们又是怎样哄堂大笑的！这位年轻绅士喜欢开玩笑，虽然大学快毕业了，还是长不大。最近，他异想天开，每周来访时，都为小主妇带上一些实用的新发明。这次送一包奇特的衣服夹子，下次送一个神奇的肉豆蔻磨碎机，谁知，第一次用就散架了。一个刀具清洁器，却把所有的刀具都糟蹋了；一个清扫器，能拔除地毯的绒毛，却留下了尘土；省力肥皂，却使人手上蜕皮；强力胶，对什么都无效，却能粘住上当受骗的买主的手指；还有各种马口铁工艺品，从收集分币的玩具储蓄罐到精致的汽锅，这汽锅能用蒸汽洗东西，可在洗涤过程中随时都可能爆炸。

美格恳求劳里不要再送了，可没用。约翰嘲笑他，乔叫他“再见先生”。可劳里正被一种狂热冲昏了头脑，他愿意资助美国佬的发明创造，喜欢看到朋友们逐件添置器具，所以每个礼拜都有滑稽可笑的新鲜事。

终于，一切都准备就绪。工作细致到艾美已经准备了各色肥皂，与不同颜色的房间相配，还有，贝丝也为第一顿饭摆放了餐桌。

“满意了吗？看上去像小家庭吗？你感到在这儿会幸福吗？”马奇太太问。母女俩正手挽着手在巡视这新王国。此时，她俩显得越发互相依恋了。

“是的，妈妈，十分满意。感谢你们。幸福得说不出话了。”美格回答。她的表情胜于言语。

“要是有一两个仆人就好了。”艾美从客厅走出来说道。她在那里试图敲定，墨丘利铜像是放在博古架上好，还是放在壁炉台上好。

“妈和我谈过这事，我决心先试试她的办法。我有洛蒂帮我跑腿，忙这忙那，该不会有多少事情要做的了。我要干的活儿，只够使我免于懒惰和想家。”美格平静地答道。

“萨莉·莫法特可有四个仆人呢。”艾美说。

“要是美格有四个，屋子里也没法住下，先生与太太只好在花园里扎营了。”乔插了嘴。她身系一条蓝色大围裙，正在为门把手做最后的加工。

“萨莉可不是穷人妻，众多的女仆也正适合她的豪宅。美格和约翰起点低，可是我觉得，小屋里会有大房子里同样多的幸福。像美格这样的少妇若是什么事也不干，一味打扮、发号施令、闲聊，那就大错特错了。刚结婚时，我总是盼着新衣服快点穿坏撕破，这样就有缝缝补补的乐趣了。我打心里烦透了钩编织品，摆弄手帕。”

“干吗不去厨房捣鼓菜呢？萨莉说她就是这样玩烹饪的，尽管烧的东西总是不好吃，仆人们也总笑她。”美格说道。

“后来我就是那么做的，但不是瞎捣鼓，而是向汉娜学着做。我的仆人们就不用笑话我了。当时是玩玩的。可是，自己一度感到很受用，我不仅有决心，也有能力为我的小姑娘们烧煮健康食物。后来我雇不起帮工了，也可以自力更生。美格，乖乖，你是倒过来开始的。但是现在学的课程，等约翰完成小康时，迟早会派上用场。对家庭主妇来说，不管多么阔气，如果希望仆人忠实尽力，都应知道干活的门道。”

“是的，妈妈，我相信的。”美格说，她毕恭毕敬地听着这个小小的教诲。就管家这引人入胜的话题来说，大部分妇女都会滔滔不绝的。“知道吗？小屋里我最喜欢的就是这一间。”很快，她们上了楼，美格看着装满亚麻织品的衣橱说道。

贝丝正在那儿，将雪白的织品齐整地码放在橱架上，得意地端详着这漂亮的礼物。听了美格的话，三人都笑了起来，那批亚麻织品可是个笑话呢。要知道，姑婆曾说过，假如美格嫁给那个布鲁克，就休想得到她的一文钱。可是，当时间平息了她的怒气，当她为自己发的誓后悔时，老太太左右为难了。她从不食言，便绞尽脑汁想办法绕过去，最后设计了一个自以为是的方案。弗洛伦斯的妈妈卡罗尔太太，奉命采购、定做了一大批装饰屋子和桌子的亚麻织品，并印上专门标记，作为自己的礼品送给美格。事情不折不扣地照办了，但无奈走漏了风声。全家人大为受用，因为姑婆还装聋作哑，坚称只能给那串老式的珍珠项链，因为她早就承诺要送给第一个新娘的。

“这是我很高兴看到的，是当家主妇才有的品味。以前我有个年轻朋友，开始成家时只有六床被单，但因有洗指钵伴着她而心满意足。”马奇太太带着道地的女性鉴赏力，轻轻拍打着织花台布。

“我连一个洗指钵也没有，但是，这份家当够我用一辈子的了，汉娜也这样说。”美格看上去一副知足的样子。的确，她也应该知足。

“‘再见先生’来了。”乔在楼下叫了起来。大家便一起下楼迎劳里。她们生活平静，劳里的每周来访是件大事。

一个膀大腰粗的大个青年迈着有力的步子快速走了过来，他理着平头，头戴大毡帽，身穿宽松衫。他没有停步去开那低矮的篱笆门，而是跨了过来，径直走向马奇太太，一边伸出双手，热诚地说道：

“我来了，妈妈！对，没事情了。”

后面的话针对老太太眼神里流露出的慈祥询问，他漂亮的双眼露出坦然的目光迎上去。这样，小小的仪式像往常一样，以母亲的一吻结束。

“这个给约翰·布鲁克太太，并代表制作人的恭贺。贝丝，上帝保佑你！乔，你真是别有风韵。艾美，你出落得太漂亮了，不宜再当单身小姐了。”

劳里一边说着，一边丢给美格一个牛皮纸包，扯了扯贝丝的发带，盯着乔的大围裙，在艾美面前假装出一副痴迷样，然后和众人一一握手，大家便攀谈来。

“约翰在哪？”美格焦急地问道。

“为了准备明天的结婚登记，他已经什么都顾不上了，太太。”

“上场比赛哪边赢了，特迪？”乔问道。尽管已经十九岁，乔一如既往地对男人的运动感兴趣。

“当然是我们了。真希望你也在场。”

“那位可爱的兰德尔小姐怎么样了？”艾美意味深长地笑着问。

“更残忍了，看不出我已经给折磨成什么样子了？”劳里响亮地拍着宽阔的胸膛，夸张地叹息道。

“这最后一个礼物又有什么鬼名堂？美格，打开包裹瞧瞧。”贝丝好奇地打量着鼓鼓囊囊的包裹，说道。

“家里有这个很管用的，防火防盗。”劳里说。在姑娘们的笑声中，一个更夫用的梆子出现在众人眼前。

“一旦约翰不在家，而你又感到害怕的时候，布鲁克夫人，只要在前窗摇一摇它，邻居立刻就能惊动。这东西很妙，是不是？”劳里示范其效力，大家不由捂住了耳朵。

“你们的配合真让我感激！说到感激，我想到一件事，你们可得谢谢汉娜，是她保护了婚宴蛋糕免遭毁灭。我过来时看到了蛋糕进屋，要不是她英勇地护卫着，我会吃上几口的。好像加了好些提子呢。”

“真不知道你什么时候才能长大，劳里。”美格带着主妇的口气说道。

“我尽力而为，太太。恐怕长不了多高了。在这堕落的年代，六英尺大概是所有男人能长到的高度了。”小先生回答，他的脑袋快够到那枝形小吊灯了。

“我想，新闺房里吃东西会亵渎神灵的，可我饿极了，因此，我提议休会。”接着他补充道。

“我和妈妈要等约翰呢，还有最后一些事情要料理。”美格说着，急急忙忙走开了。

“我和贝丝要去吉蒂·布莱恩特家为明天婚礼多弄些鲜花。”艾美接过话头。她华美的鬈发上戴着花妖的帽子，和大家一样大为欣赏如此装扮的效果。

“乔，来吧，别丢开男孩子。我筋疲力尽，没人帮扶回不了家的。无论如何不要解下围裙，别样好看。”劳里说道。乔将那个他特别讨厌的围裙放入大口袋里，伸出胳膊，支撑他无力的脚步。

“好了，特迪，我要和你谈谈明天的正经事。”他们一起离开时，乔开口了，“你必须保证放规矩一点，别搞恶作剧，破坏我们的计划。”

“绝不再犯。”

“该严肃时，别说滑稽的事情。”

“我从来不说。你才会说呢。”

“还有，我恳求你在婚礼进行中别看我。你要是看，我肯定要笑的。”

“你不会看到我的。你会哭得很厉害，厚厚的泪雾将模糊你的视线。”

“除非伤心万分，我不会哭的。”

“比方男孩子们去上大学啦？”劳里笑着插嘴暗示她。

“别神气活现了，我只是陪姐妹们一起呜咽了一小会儿。”

“千真万确。我说乔，爷爷这礼拜好吗？脾气还温和吗？”

“非常温和。怎么？你惹麻烦了，想知道他会怎样接受？”乔很尖锐地问道。

“哎呀，乔，你以为，如果惹了麻烦，我会有脸正儿八经对你妈妈说‘万事如意’的吗？”劳里突然停步，露出受伤的样子。

“嗯，我觉得不会。”

“那就别疑神疑鬼的。只是需要弄些钱。”劳里说道。她热切的语气抚慰了他，他继续走路。

“花钱太厉害了，特迪。”

“天哪，不是我花了钱，而是钱自己花掉了。不知不觉，钱就没了。”

“你那么慷慨大方，富于同情心。借钱给别人，对任何人都不好意思说‘不’。我们听说了亨肖的事，听说了你为他尽心尽力。要是一直像那样花钱，没人会怪你。”乔热情地说。

“噢，他小题目做大了。他一人可以抵一打我们这样的懒家伙，你总不会让我眼睁睁看着好人只为缺少区区一点帮扶而劳累致死吧？”

“当然不会。但是，你有十七件背心，数不清的领带，每次回家都戴一顶新帽子，我看不出这有什么好处。我还以为，你已经过了爱慕虚荣的时期。可老毛病时不时又在新的地方冒出来。如今丑陋倒成了时髦——把头弄成了板刷相，紧身夹克，橙色手套，厚底方头靴。要是这么难看的打扮不要钱，我就不说话，可它照样费钱，而且我看了一点满意度也没有。”

听了这一攻击，劳里仰头哈哈大笑，结果毡帽掉到了地上，被乔从上面踏过去。这个侮辱只为他提供了阐述粗糙实用服饰有好处的机会。他折叠起惨遭虐待的帽子，塞进口袋。

“别再说教了，好人儿！我整个礼拜够烦的了，回家来想轻松快活一下的。明天，我还是要不惜工本打扮起来，让我的朋友们满意。”

“只要把头发蓄起来我就保你太平。我不是贵族，但反对让人看见和个貌似职业拳击手的小伙子在一起。”乔严肃地说。

“这种不显摆的发型能促进学习的，所以我们才采用。”劳里回答。他主动牺牲了漂亮的鬈发，迁就这种只有四分之一英寸长的短发茬要求，当然不能指责他爱慕虚荣。

“顺便说说，乔，我看那个小帕克真的是为艾美死去活来了。他一刻不停地念叨她，为她写诗，神不守舍的，让人起疑。他最好将稚嫩的激情消灭于萌芽状态，是不是？”沉默了片刻，劳里以推心置腹的、长兄般的口气接着说道。

“当然。我们家里不希望几年内又出什么婚姻大事。我的天哪，这些孩子们在想些什么东西啊？”乔看上去怒不可遏，仿佛艾美和小帕克还没有长到十三岁。

“如今是快节奏时代，不知道我们以后会什么样子，小姐啊。你是个小丫头，但下一个出嫁的就是你了，把我们留下来悲叹。”劳里对这堕落的时代大摇其头。

“别惊慌，我不是那种可人儿。没有人要我，那也是神的恩赐，一家子里总要有个老处女的。”

“你就是不给任何人机会呀。”劳里说着斜瞥了她一眼，晒黑的脸庞上泛起了一点红晕，“不愿将性格里温柔的一面示人。假如哪个小伙子凑巧窥视到这一面，不由自主地表示爱慕之情，你会像戈米基太太[2]对她的情人那样待他——向他泼冷水——变得浑身长刺，没有人敢碰你、看你。”

“不喜欢那种事情。太忙了，没空为废话烦恼。我觉得以那种方式分裂家庭很可怕的。好了，别提这事了。美格的婚礼把我们大家的脑子都弄乱了，整天价谈情人这类荒唐事儿。我不愿发脾气，所以换个话题吧。”乔看上去很严肃，稍有挑衅便会大泼冷水。

不管劳里有什么情绪，还是发泄出来了的——在门口分手时，劳里低声吹了个长口哨，并作了可怕的预言：“记住我的话，乔，下一个出嫁的是你。”

第二十五章　第一个婚礼


那是一个六月的清晨，万里无云。阳台上的月季花睁开蒙眬的睡眼，在晨光的照耀下，满怀喜悦地开得正艳，宛如一个个友好的小邻居，事实也正是如此。它们随风摇曳，激动得满脸通红，窃窃私语，谈论着看到的一切。有些花儿正透过厨房的窗口往里面窥探，看到那里摆着宴席；有些花儿爬到上面，对着正为新娘打扮的姐妹们点头微笑；还有些花儿挥手致意，迎接那些在花园、阳台和过道里来来往往忙碌着的人们。无论鲜艳盛开的花朵，还是含苞欲放的蓓蕾，花园里所有的月季都把自己的美丽和芳香献给这位温柔的女主人。因为长期以来，女主人对它们呵护有加，细心照料。

美格自己看上去就像一朵玫瑰状月季花。那天，她心灵深处最美好、最甜蜜的事似乎都升华在了脸上，使它显得格外美丽动人，充满魅力，漂亮无比。她不要丝绸礼服，婚纱上也没有花边，连白色香橙花都没有要。“今天我不想见外人，不要打扮。”她说，“我不要时髦的婚礼，只要有我爱的一些人在身边，对他们，我只想做他们熟悉的那个我。”

因此，她自己做结婚礼服，把少女内心温柔的期望和天真的浪漫向往都缝进了婚纱。妹妹们给她的秀发扎起辫子，她仅有的饰品就是几朵铃兰花，这是世上百花中，她的约翰最最喜欢的。

等打扮完了，艾美高兴地审视着姐姐，嘴里喊道：“你真的是我们亲爱的美格，这么漂亮，这么可爱，要不是怕你的衣服弄皱，我真想抱你。”

“这么说，我就心满意足了。请你们每个人都抱我，吻我吧，别管衣服。今天，我还想在婚纱上添加很多这种褶皱呢。”美格向妹妹们张开双臂，她们依偎在姐姐身边一阵子，满脸春意，心里觉得新的爱丝毫没有改变往日的姐妹手足情。

“好了，我要去替约翰打领结，再和爸爸在书房里静静地待上几分钟。”说完，美格跑下楼，去完成这些小礼节，然后形影不离地跟着妈妈。她心里明白，虽然妈妈慈祥的脸上带着微笑，可看到第一只小鸟就要离巢去翱翔，慈母心里不免黯然神伤。

妹妹们站在一起，为自己简朴的打扮作最后的修饰。现在这个当口，正好描绘一下过去三年里姑娘们外表上的一些变化，因为她们此刻统统打扮得最漂亮。

乔的棱角已经磨平不少，虽然不很有风度，可她学会了举止自然。卷曲的短发已经长成了浓密的一团，高个子和小脑袋更趋和谐。棕色的双颊气色很好，温柔的双眸闪闪发亮，那张利嘴里现在说出的都是温和的话语。

贝丝身材更加纤细，脸色更加苍白，性格更加文静。美丽、善良的双眼更大了，可眼神却哀而不怨。年轻的脸上点缀着痛苦的阴影，却透出几分坚毅，真是可怜。贝丝很少抱怨，总是满怀希望地说“很快就会好起来的”。

艾美作为家庭之花名副其实。她只有十六岁，却已经具有成熟女性的神态和风度，并不算漂亮，却拥有那种难以言喻的魅力——这就是风姿绰约。显而易见，她身上的曲线、举手投足、飘垂的服饰和披散的秀发，能吸引很多人——没有刻意的修饰，却非常协调，正如美本身。艾美的鼻子仍旧是她的一块心病，它永远都不可能长笔挺了。她的嘴巴太大，也让她苦恼不堪，更甭提那个坚定的下巴了。这些刺眼的特征使她整张脸都与众不同，可她自己看不到。还好，她还有美白的肌肤，敏锐的蓝眼睛和日益浓密的金色鬈发，借此聊以自慰。

三个妹妹都身穿薄薄的银灰色衣裙（她们夏天最好的裙服），头上和胸前都别着红玫瑰。三位姑娘都显出了少女的本色——脸上充满青春活力，心中洋溢着幸福快乐。她们生活过得忙忙碌碌。此时，要在人生驿站驻足片刻，用渴望的双眼，去解读女人浪漫人生中最甜蜜的一章。

没有隆重的仪式，一切都是那么自然、亲切。这时，马奇姑婆到了，看到眼前的一切大不以为然：新娘竟跑出来迎她，而新郎却忙着固定掉下来的花环，身为父亲的牧师则两只胳膊下各夹着一瓶酒一本正经地往楼上走。

“我的天，真是好样子啊！”老太太叫着，在为她准备的贵宾席上就座，拉扯着她那淡紫色波纹绸衣的皱褶，发出好一阵沙沙声，“孩子，要到最后一刻才能露面呀。”

“姑婆，我又不是展品，没有人来评头论足，讨论服饰，估算婚宴的费用。我太幸福了，顾不上别人怎么说怎么想。我要以自己喜欢的方式举行我的小小婚礼。约翰，亲爱的，给你锤子。”美格就这样走开了，去帮那人干那件完全不得体的工作。

布鲁克先生甚至没有说声“谢谢”。但他弯腰去接那毫不浪漫的工具时，在折叠门背后吻了他的小新娘，见了他那种神态，姑婆急速地掏出手帕，抹去突然涌进她敏锐老眼的泪滴。

哗啦声，叫喊声，劳里的笑声，伴随着不雅的惊叹：“大神啊！好家伙！乔又把蛋糕倒翻了！”这下引起了一阵忙乱。这边还没完，那边又来了一群堂表兄妹。正像贝丝小时候常说的：“大队人马驾到。”

“别让那小巨人靠近我。他比蚊子还让我烦。”老太太对艾美耳语道。屋子里挤满了人，而劳里的黑色脑袋可谓鹤立鸡群。

“他答应过今天好好表现。如果他愿意，他能做到非常优雅。”艾美回答道。她溜过去警告海格立斯要当心火龙喷火，可警告反倒使他一心一意缠住老太太，让她差点晕头转向。

没有长长的婚礼队伍，但当马奇先生和这对新人在绿色的拱门下站住时，房间里立刻显得肃静一片。母亲和妹妹们紧紧地依偎在一起，仿佛舍不得美格出阁。父亲的声音不止一次地中断，这使婚礼仪式更加美妙庄严。大家都看到，新郎的手在颤抖，连说话声别人都听不清楚了。可美格却直视着丈夫说：“我愿意！”神情和声音里都充满深情和信任，这让母亲感到欣喜万分，而姑婆却嗤之以鼻。

尽管乔差一点就想号啕大哭，可还是没有哭出声，因为她意识到劳里正盯着她看，他那双刻薄的黑眼睛里透出几分喜悦和深情。贝丝把脸靠在母亲肩上，艾美却站在一边，一缕柔和的阳光照着她那雪白的脑门和头上的月季花，她活像一尊优美的雕塑。

事情恐怕并非中规中矩啊，一等仪式结束，美格就哭出声来：“第一个吻献给妈咪！”说着转过身，满怀深情地给了母亲一个亲吻。在接下来的一刻钟里，美格显得更像一朵玫瑰，不管是劳伦斯先生，还是老汉娜，每个人都充分利用这个难得的机会，向美格表示祝福。汉娜围着一条细心织就、非常精致的头巾，在过道里就扑到美格身上，又哭又笑着喊道：“祝福你，乖乖，百福百福！蛋糕一点都没有搞坏，一切都很好！”

随后，大家都开心起来，说些高兴的话，至少尽量这么做。这也有效，因为大家心情轻松，很快就欢声笑语。礼物没有展示，都已经放进了小屋子新房，也没有丰盛的早餐，只有午餐还算丰富，蛋糕加水果，又点缀了一些鲜花。劳伦斯先生和马奇姑婆发现三位赫柏[1]往来穿梭，提供的玉液琼浆只有水、柠檬水和咖啡。他们耸耸肩，相对而笑。但是谁也没说话，直到劳里出现在新娘面前。他手端装满食物的托盘，脸上带着迷惑的神情，坚持让新娘吃东西。

“是不是乔不慎把酒瓶都打碎了？”他轻声问，“或许我张冠李戴了，早上看见地上有一些碎酒瓶。”

“不是的，你爷爷很客气，把最好的酒拿来给了我们。而且，姑婆也送过来一些。但是爸爸给贝丝留了少许以后，便把剩下的送去军人之家了。是这样，他认为只有生病时才应该喝酒。妈妈说，她和女儿们都不会在家中用酒招待小伙子的。”

美格正经八百地说着，以为劳里会皱眉或耻笑，但他不为所动，只是迅速地瞥了她一眼，以他习惯性的口吻说：“我喜欢那样！我看够了喝酒害人，希望别的女人也跟你们一个想法。”

“希望这不是经验之谈吧。”美格的口气里有些担心。

“不是，我向你保证。但也别把我想得太好，这不属于我面临的诱惑。在我长大的国家，葡萄酒和水一样平常，而且几乎无害。我不喜欢喝酒，但是，如果美丽的姑娘前来敬酒，就不想拒绝了，是吧？”

“可你要拒绝的，即使不为自己，也要为别人着想。劳里，答应我，就算给我增加一条理由，证明今天是毕生最幸福的日子好了。”

突如其来的殷殷请求使小伙子一时犹豫起来，因为嘲弄往往比自我克制更难消受。美格知道，一旦答应下来，他将不惜一切代价遵守诺言。她感觉到了自己的力量，为了朋友的好，她以女人的方式运了力。她没有说话，抬头看着他。幸福洋溢在她的脸上，她的笑容似乎在说：“今天谁也不能拒绝我的要求。”劳里当然不能。带着会意的笑容，他把手伸给她，由衷地说道：“我答应你，布鲁克太太！”

“谢谢你，非常非常感谢。”

“祝你的决心健康长寿，干杯，特迪。”乔叫着，泼了一杯柠檬汁为他洗礼。她摇着杯子，赞许地朝他微笑。

就这样，祝酒，发誓，尽管有许多的诱惑，劳里还是恪守了诺言。女孩们凭着本能的智慧，瞅准了一个喜庆时刻替朋友效劳，为此劳里终身感谢她们。

午餐后，人们三三两两在房子、花园里闲步，享受着屋里屋外的阳光。美格和约翰碰巧一起站在草地中央。劳里突然来了灵感，一下子给这不时髦的婚礼最后润了色。

“所有结了婚的人拉起手来，围着新郎新娘跳舞，就像德国人那样，我们单身汉、姑娘家在外围对跳！”劳里喊道，他正和艾美沿着小路散步。他说话很有技巧，极具感染力，大家毫无异议，跟着跳起来。马奇先生和马奇太太、卡罗尔叔叔和婶婶先开了头，别的人很快加入进去。萨莉·莫法特犹豫再三，也将裙裾挽在臂上，迅速将内德拖进舞圈。最可笑的是劳伦斯先生和马奇姑婆这一对。稳重的老先生跳着庄严的滑步过来邀请老太太，老太太将拐杖往胳膊下一夹，便轻快地跟大家一起绕着新人转起来。而年轻人们像仲夏时节的蝴蝶一样，满花园地翩翩起舞。

大家跳得气喘吁吁，即兴舞会这才结束。随后人们纷纷离去。

“祝你幸福，宝贝，衷心地祝你万事如意！可你会后悔的。”姑婆对美格说。新郎把她送上马车，她又对新郎说：“小伙子，你得了个宝贝，可要确保配得上她。”

“内德，这婚礼一点都不时髦，可不知为什么，总觉得这是我多年参加过的最美妙的婚礼。”驾车离开时，萨莉·莫法特对丈夫说。

“劳里，我的孩子，要是你想享受这种福气，就在那些小姑娘中挑一个，我没意见。”兴奋了一上午，劳伦斯先生说，他正坐在安乐椅上休息。

“我会尽力让您称心如意的，爷爷。”劳里一边格外恭敬地回答，一边小心翼翼地把花朵拔掉，这是乔插在他纽扣孔里的。

小房子离得不远，美格仅有的蜜月旅行就是与约翰静静地散步，从老家走到新家。美格下楼来，身穿鸽灰色的衣裙，头戴系着白结的草帽，宛如一位漂亮的贵格会[2]女教徒，全家人都围在她身边，依依不舍地说“再见”，仿佛她要去出远门。

“妈咪，不要觉得我和您分开了，千万别认为我爱约翰就不爱您了。”她满含热泪，依偎在母亲身上，过了好一会儿又说，“爸爸，我每天都会回来的。我出嫁了，可但愿你们大家心里还能给我留个位置。贝丝没事会常来陪我，乔和艾美也会常过来，看我在家务活上闹的笑话。谢谢大家，让我的婚礼过得很开心。再见，再见！”

他们一直站在那里，目送美格走远，脸上个个都洋溢着爱意、希望和自豪。美格依靠在丈夫臂弯里，双手捧满鲜花。六月的阳光照亮了开心的脸——就这样，美格的婚姻生活开始了。

要辨别才能和天赋，得旷日持久，尤其对那些踌躇满志的青年男女来说。在经历诸多磨难之后，艾美才领悟了这种区别。由于错把热情当灵感，她以年轻人特有的张狂尝试过各种艺术。“泥饼”作业歇了好长一段时间，她又全身心地扑在钢笔画上，这体现出她的品味和才情，那些优美的作品不仅赏心悦目，还给她带来了收益。不过，钢笔画太费眼神，她又大胆地尝试起烙画来。她进军烙画的那些日子，全家人一直生活在惊恐不安之中，生怕火灾突临。整座房子夜以继日地弥漫着烤焦炭的气味，烟雾时不时地从阁楼和工作间里冒出来，让人提心吊胆。各种型号的火钳烧得通红，横七竖八地乱搁一气，以致汉娜上床前总要备好一桶水，并将开饭铃放在门边以防起火。画神拉斐尔的头像很醒目地烙制在擀面板反面，酒神巴克斯的头像则被烙在啤酒桶顶上。装糖的桶盖上，点缀上了一个唱歌的小天使，接着，她全副心思烙制罗密欧与朱丽叶，烟火又持续了一阵子。

手指烫伤了，火就顺理成章地转换成油，艾美以丝毫不减的热情迷上了油画。一位画家朋友送来废旧的调色板、画笔和颜料，她操起它们就涂抹起来。画出的田园风光和海洋景致真是陆地未见，海上难寻。画出的畸形牛足以在农产品汇展上得奖，画出的船只颠簸得险象环生，哪怕是航海经验丰富的人也会晕船，其实，她全然不顾通常的船体结构和缆索规则，内行的观者一眼看去，就会笑得前仰后合，哪会去登船受罪呢。黑黝黝的男孩肖像、黑眼睛的圣母画像，在画室的一角盯着你，这暗示着牟利罗[1]的杰作；而油褐色的阴影表示脸部，配上错位的猩红条纹，就算是伦勃朗[2]了。丰腴的女子和水肿的婴孩是鲁本斯[3]风格，而透纳[4]的意境出现在由蓝色的滚雷、橙色的闪电、褐色的雨水、紫色的云层构成的暴风雨中，中间泼着一团番茄色，可能是太阳或者是浮标，也可能是水手的衬衫或者是国王的御袍，一任观者自由想象。

接着，艾美拿起了木炭肖像画，于是全家的画像挂成一排，看上去粗野得很，黑糊糊的，仿佛刚刚从煤箱里起出来。她急流勇退，搞起了油画棒素描，这些要好些，画得挺像，艾美的头发、乔的鼻子、美格的嘴巴、劳里的眼睛都被大家一致认可，画得“极妙”。然后，艾美又重操旧业，摆弄起陶土和石膏来，她把自己的熟人都塑成可怕的雕像，幽灵似的栖息在屋子的角角落落，要是从橱柜架上掉下来，还会砸中什么人的脑袋。她把小孩子引诱来当模特儿，孩子们则把她的神秘行为，描述得牛头不对马嘴，人们便把艾美小姐当成食人小妖来看。不久，她在这个行当上的努力，因一次不幸事故突然中断了，她的热情也由此熄灭。有一阵子，她找不到好模特儿，于是用自己漂亮的脚铸模。一天，全家人被一阵千奇百怪的碰撞声和尖叫声惊起，忙不迭地冲过去救驾，发现这个小狂热者在工作室里狂跳，一只脚被紧紧地卡在装满石膏的盆里，因为石膏的硬结异常神速。费了好大的劲，冒着不小的风险，她的脚终于被挖了出来。由于乔在挖脚的时候禁不住笑出来，而把刀插得太深，划破了可怜的脚，至少给一种艺术探索留下了永久的纪念。

打这以后，艾美就偃旗息鼓了。可是，不久她又醉心于写生了，于是整天出没在河边、田野和树林，搞风景素描，渴望有名胜古迹可以描摹。她老是感冒，因为总是坐在潮湿的草地上绘制心爱的小品，其中包括石头、树桩、蘑菇和一枝折断的毛蕊花梗，或者画天上的浮云，成品看上去活像各种羽绒床褥的精品展示。她顶着盛夏时节的烈日，在河上漂流，不惜晒黑脸蛋，为的是研究光与影；她时而侧目察看，时而眯眼打量，不惜鼻梁起皱，为的是找到视点。

米开朗基罗确信：“天赋就是持之以恒。”果真如此的话，艾美可谓有一点这种超凡的品质，因为不论有多少障碍、失败和挫折，她总是孜孜以求，并且坚信，自己终有一天能创作出堪称上品的东西来。

艾美学习着、创作着，同时对其他东西也兴趣甚浓，她决心即便成不了艺术家，也要做一个多才多艺、有魅力的女子。在这一方面她比较成功，因为她属于那类天生丽质的女孩，能轻而易举地讨人喜欢，在哪儿都能交上朋友，生活轻松洒脱，以致那些不太走运的人不得不相信，她是在福星高照下出生的。人见人爱，鉴貌辨色是她的天赋之一。她有本能的讨好意识，非常识时务，知道见什么人说什么话，在什么时间、什么场合做什么事，而且她很能做到泰然自若，所以姐姐们曾经这样说：“如果艾美上法庭，即使事先没有做任何准备，她也会应付裕如。”

渴望进入上流社会是艾美的一个癖好，尽管她并不清楚到底什么是“上流”。在她看来，金钱、地位、时髦的才艺、优雅的举止是最令人羡慕的东西，所以，她喜欢与拥有这一切的人交往，不过却经常错误地认假当真，追慕那些不值得追慕的人。她向来认为自己是个天生的贵妇人，念念不忘培养自己的贵族品位和贵族感觉，以便机会一到，就可以随时扮演这个角色，只是目前家中贫困，使她无缘高贵。

朋友们称她为“我的贵妇”，她自己也非常渴望能名至实归，并已在内心深处把自己看做是贵妇。但她还不明白，金钱买不到天然的文雅，地位不总是赠予高贵的气质，良好的教养会自然而然地流露出来，外部条件的缺陷倒在其次。

“妈，请帮个忙。”一天，艾美从外面回来，一脸的严肃。

“什么事，小姑娘？”母亲问道。在母亲的眼里，这位仪态高贵的小姐仍然还是个孩子。

“下个礼拜，我们绘画班要放暑假了，放假前我想邀请姑娘们来咱家郊游一天。她们很想看看这里的河，素描一下河上的破桥，临摹一些我的画册里她们所欣赏的东西。她们在各方面对我都很好，我很感激。她们都是富家子弟，而我是个穷人的孩子，但她们从来没有另眼相看。”

“为什么要另眼相看呢？”马奇太太问道，脸上呈现出一种女儿们称之为“玛丽亚·特蕾西娅[5]神态”的表情。

“你我都清楚，几乎所有的人都嫌穷爱富。所以当你的雏鸡遭到大鸟啄击时，无须像一只溺爱的母鸡那样羽毛直竖。要知道，丑小鸭会变成小天鹅的。”艾美笑眯眯地说着，她性格开朗，满怀希望。

马奇太太笑了，她放下母亲的架子问道：“那么，我的小天鹅，你打算怎么做？”

“下礼拜，我想请姑娘们吃顿午餐，弄辆车带她们到想看的地方转转，也许还要划划船，为她们举行一个小小的艺术聚会。”

“这个计划还行。午饭吃些什么呢？蛋糕、三明治、水果和咖啡，差不多了吧？”

“哎哟，不够的！我们要有牛舌和鸡肉冷盘，还要有法国巧克力和冰淇淋。姑娘们一贯吃这些东西，我希望我的午餐体面而高雅，尽管我还得为生计奔忙。”

“会来多少姑娘呢？”母亲问她，脸色开始凝重起来。

“全班有十二到十四人，但我想不会全部来的吧。”

“天哪，孩子，你还得包辆公共马车，才能带着她们出去转。”

“哎呀，妈妈，你怎么会这样想？来的人可能不会超过六到八个，这样的话，我只要租一辆沙滩马车，再从劳伦斯先生那里借了巧蹦车（汉娜把敞篷大马车发音成这样）就行了。”

“操办这一切很费钱的，艾美。”

“不会很多，我已算过费用，我自己来支付。”

“乖乖，你想过没有？这些姑娘对这些东西习以为常，我们就是尽再大的努力，她们也不会有新鲜感。也许粗茶淡饭反而能讨她们欢心，至少可以换个口味，而这样对我们来说会好得多，不需要的东西就不用去买去借，不用去尝试那种与境况不符的做派。”

“如果不能如我所愿，那宁可不办。我肯定能把它办得很好，如果你和姐姐们再帮上一把，那更是锦上添花。我不明白，为什么我自己花钱还不能办。”艾美说道，她的决心由于遇到了反对而变得执著。

马奇太太明白，经验是最好的老师。可能的话，她总是放手让孩子们自己去吸取教训。不过，要是她们不像拒吃泻盐、通便剂一样忌讳逆耳忠言的话，她倒很乐意使教训变得轻一些。

“那好，艾美，如果你决心已定，又觉得不会太费钱，不会浪费时间和耐心，那你就去办吧，我不会再说什么。你去跟姐姐们商量商量吧，不管做出什么样的决定，我都会尽力帮助你的。”

“谢谢妈妈，你总是这么好。”艾美转身找姐姐们公布自己的计划去了。

美格立刻同意了，她答应相助，并乐意奉献自己所有的任何东西，无论是新房小屋，还是最高档的盐匙。但是，乔反对这个计划，起先根本不想介入。

“究竟为什么，你要花费自己的钱，烦扰自己的家人，把全家整个鸡犬不宁，去讨好一帮压根儿就不关心你的人？我原以为你很高傲很有见识，不会去巴结那些俗女人的。有什么了不起的？仅仅穿法国靴，坐轿式马车而已！”乔发话了。她正在写小说，情节正到了悲剧的高潮，所以情绪不太好，没心思搞社交活动。

“我没有巴结谁，跟你一样讨厌被人施舍！”艾美愤愤地回答。她俩碰到类似的问题，还是要争吵几句。“那些姑娘关心我，我也关心她们。尽管你把那些东西说成是时髦的废话，但她们很有善意，有见识，有才能。你不愿讨人喜欢，不愿进入上流社会，不愿培养自己的风度和品味，可我愿意，我可要充分利用每一次机会。你就管自己衣衫褴褛、挺胸凸肚地招摇过市吧，并号称这是自立，悉听尊便。我可不想这么过。”

艾美伶牙俐齿，思维开阔，言语间始终合情合理，所以总是占上风；而乔侈谈自由，愤世嫉俗，喜欢走极端，争论中自然是一败涂地。艾美对乔的自立观描述得如此的贴切，以致两个人都忍不住突然笑了出来，于是气氛轻松了。尽管很违心，乔还是同意牺牲一天的时间“追俗流”，帮妹妹完成这件在她认为是无聊的事。

请柬发出去，几乎所有的人都接受了，盛大的活动就定在下个礼拜一。由于一礼拜的工作安排都被打乱了，汉娜情绪很不好。她预言：“移（衣服）如果澌汤（洗烫）不宁（能）按次（时）完成，一彻（一切）都会乱了套。”家庭机器的主轴出故障，将妨碍全局的运转，但艾美的格言是“不言放弃”，只要是下定决心要做的事，她都会排除万难，义无反顾地做到底。首先，汉娜的烹饪做坏了，鸡肉太老，牛舌太咸，巧克力起泡不正常。接着，蛋糕和冰淇淋的开支比艾美预计的要高，租车费和许多杂费也超出了预算。原先以为这都是些小事，要不了几个钱，结果却费用惊人。贝丝感冒了，卧病在床。美格家来了众多客人，缠得她脱不开身。乔心不在焉，老是摔碎杯盘，出现差错，而且情况严重，令人心烦意乱。

“要不是有妈帮忙，我那天根本就过不了关。”艾美咋呼道。她事后充满感激地回忆着，其实大家早已把“那一季节最好笑的事”忘得一干二净了。

礼拜一天气要是不好，姑娘们要推迟到礼拜二来访，这样安排使得乔和汉娜恼火得无以复加。礼拜一这天早晨，天气反复无常，这比豪雨倾盆更让人揪心。时而细雨霏霏，时而半晴半阴，时而寒风阵阵，使你下不了决心，做不出决定。待到天气稳定下来时，一切都已晚啦。艾美在拂晓前就起了床，她把其他人都从床上拖起来，匆匆用完早餐，以便收拾屋子。她突然发现，她家的客厅太破旧了，但并没有因此怨天尤人，而是因地制宜，将客厅巧妙地布置起来。她在地毯磨破的地方摆上椅子，用常青藤当画框的图画挡住墙壁上的污点，用自塑的雕像填补在客厅四角空闲处，乔也摆上插有鲜花的漂亮花瓶四处补遗，客厅平添了一些艺术气息。

她打量着备好的午餐，真心希望这看上去很诱人的菜肴能美味可口，希望那些借来的玻璃杯、细瓷碗和银餐具能完好地归还。车子已经预定好了，美格和母亲随时准备一尽地主之谊，贝丝可以帮助汉娜在后面做些事。乔答应保证情绪活跃，面容和蔼，尽管心不在焉，头痛不已，因为她讨厌并坚决反对她已经无奈答应的这一切及其始作俑者。艾美一边疲倦地梳妆打扮，一边打起精神期待着那个幸福的时刻：午餐圆满结束后，她将和朋友们一起驱车去享受一个下午的艺术喜悦，“巧蹦车”和破桥是她的强项。

令人提心吊胆的两个小时中，她不停地从客厅蹦到门廊，再从门廊走回客厅。大家七嘴八舌，意见像风标似的没个定论。正值十一点，一阵大雨显然泼灭了小姐们的兴致，原来安排十二点时到艾美家，结果谁也没来。到了下午两点，筋疲力尽的一家人围坐在灿烂的阳光下，吃掉了易变质的那部分美食，以免造成浪费。

次日早晨，阳光唤醒了艾美。她说道：“今天无疑是个好天气，她们肯定会来，我们得赶快准备。”话虽然说得精神抖擞，可在内心深处，她却但愿自己压根儿就没有提起过礼拜二，因为她的热情如同她的蛋糕，已经有点不新鲜了。

“买不到龙虾，今天就不要做色拉了。”半小时后马奇先生进屋来，一脸无奈地说道。

“那就用鸡肉替代吧，肉老一点做色拉没关系的。”他太太建议说。

“很抱歉，艾美，汉娜把鸡肉放在厨案上，就一会儿工夫，几只小猫已把它吃了。”贝丝紧接着说，她一直宠养着她的猫。

“那就必须搞到龙虾，仅有牛舌是不行的。”艾美决然地说。

“我赶到镇上去买一只来，怎么样？”乔问，像殉道者一样慷慨。

“你会不包纸袋就夹在胳膊下带回家，这是气我呢。我自己去。”艾美答道，脾气开始大了起来。

披上厚厚的面纱，提着斯文的旅行篮，艾美出发了。她觉得，在车上吹吹冷风，能平息自己的烦躁情绪，以适应这一天的劳动。费了一些周折，她如愿以偿地搞到了所要的东西，还买了一瓶调料，以免在家里再浪费时间。她乘上了回程车，为自己的先见之明得意扬扬。

公共马车上只有她和另外一个乘客，那是个睡意蒙眬的老妇人。艾美把面纱装进了口袋，开始回忆自己的钱都花在哪里了，以打发沉闷的路程。她一心合计着纸片上横七竖八的数字，未察觉又上来了一个新乘客。此人上来时车也没停，等到一个男人的声音在她耳边响起，“早上好！马奇小姐。”她才抬起头来，原来是劳里的大学同学中最文雅的那个人。她急切地盼望着他能在她之前下车，而完全忘记了自己脚边的篮子。她一边暗自庆幸穿了新的外出裙服，一边回答了小伙子的问候，口气温柔热情，一如平常。

他们谈得很好，艾美了解到他先下车，最关心的问题解决了，她那颗悬着的心放了下来。她谈兴正浓，内容特崇高，正在这时，那个老妇人要下车了。她步履蹒跚地朝车门走去，碰翻了篮子。哦，天哪！——那只尺寸粗大、色形俗丽的龙虾整个儿地呈现在都铎王室后裔的贵眼之下。

“天呐，她忘了带上自己的午餐了！”不知情的小伙子喊了一句，接着用手杖把鲜红的怪物拨回原处，准备追去把篮子递给老妇人。

“请不要——这是——是我的。”艾美低声地说，脸红得像那只龙虾。

“哦，是吗，请原谅。这是只非常好的龙虾，不是吗？”都铎说道。只见他神定气闲，饶有兴趣，不愧为有教养的人。

艾美很快恢复了常态，把篮子大大方方地摆在座位上，笑着说：“难道你不想尝尝龙虾做的色拉，同时看着品尝龙虾色拉的迷人姑娘？”

此话很有策略，刺激了男人心里的两个主要弱点。龙虾立刻戴上了一圈愉快回忆的光环，对迷人姑娘的好奇，更使他不去留意那滑稽的尴尬境遇。

“他肯定会把这一幕当成笑话告诉劳里的。不过，反正没当着我的面，眼不见心不烦。”当都铎躬身离去时，艾美心里想着。

她没跟家里人提起这次遭遇（尽管她发现由于篮子倒翻，新裙服被流出的调料弄脏了，污汁沿着裙子蜿蜒流下），而是马上着手午宴准备，只是越发有点厌倦了。到了十二点，所有的一切再次准备就绪。她能感觉到邻居们对她的活动很关注，所以希望用今天的巨大成功，抹去昨天失败的记忆。于是，她叫来了“巧蹦车”，隆重地驱车前去迎接贵宾赴宴。

“那是车轮的声音，她们来了！我要到门廊去迎接她们，这样才显得好客。我要让可怜的孩子玩得快乐，她可费了那么多神呢。”马奇太太说着就站起身来。可望了一眼，她就退了回来，脸上的表情无法形容，因为宽大的车厢里空空荡荡，只坐着艾美和一个姑娘。

“快去，贝丝，帮汉娜把桌子上的东西撤下一半。在一个姑娘面前摆上十二个人用的午餐太荒唐了。”乔大声说着，赶紧躲到地下室，兴奋得都来不及笑出来。

艾美进来了，她镇定自若，热情地款待这唯一守信的客人。家里的其他人都有戏剧天分，也很好地扮演了自己的角色。艾略特小姐觉得这是个十分嬉闹的集体，他们的身上洋溢着无法抑制的欢乐气氛。愉快地享用了重新调整过的午餐，参观了画室和花园，热烈地讨论了艺术之后，艾美叫来一辆轻便的双人车（可惜了高雅的‘巧蹦车’! ），平静地带着朋友在街坊间游玩。落日时分，聚会结束。

她步行着走进家门，神情非常疲惫，但极其沉着。她觉察到，倒霉聚会的所有痕迹已经消失，只是乔的嘴角还有着一丝可疑的撅起。

“乖乖，你们下午去兜风，天气不错呀。”母亲殷勤地问候道，仿佛十二个人都到齐了。

“艾略特小姐是个很可亲的姑娘，我看她玩得很愉快。”贝丝以不同寻常的热情接话。

“能分给我一些蛋糕吗？我很需要的，来了那么多的客人，自己又不会做这么好吃的蛋糕。”美格认真地要求道。

“都拿去吧。家里只有我一个人喜欢吃甜点，没等我吃完就会发霉了。”艾美嘴上说着，心里却在叹息，自己的慷慨准备却等来了这么个下场。

“真可惜劳里没在，没法帮我们吃。”当她们坐下来吃这两天里的冰淇淋和色拉时，乔开始说话了。

母亲以警告的眼神让她别再说什么。全家人缄口不言，狼吞虎咽起来。终于，马奇先生温和地打破了沉默：“色拉是古人最喜欢吃的一道菜，伊夫林[6]——”他的话还没说完，全家人突然哄堂大笑，让这位博学绅士深感意外。

“把所有的东西装进篮子，给胡梅尔家送去。德国人喜欢吃大杂烩的。我一看到这些就倒胃口，没有理由因为我的愚蠢而让你们撑死。”艾美擦着眼泪大声说道。

“看着你们两个姑娘在那辆——你称它什么来着——车里颠簸着，像两颗果仁在硕大的果壳里跳动，看着妈妈毕恭毕敬等在那里准备迎接一大群客人，我想我快要笑死了。”乔叹息道，这会儿她再也笑不出来了。

“我很难过，你失望了，乖乖，但我们大家都是竭尽全力来使你满意的。”马奇太太说道，语气里充满了母爱和遗憾。

“我很满意。应承的，我都做到了，没有成功不是我的错，我问心无愧。”艾美的声音有点颤抖，“非常感谢大家的帮忙，如果你们不再提起此事，至少在一个月内不提，我会更加感激。”

此后的几个月里，没有人再提及此事，但是“聚会”这个词总能让大家生发出一丝会意的微笑。劳里送给艾美的生日礼物，就是一个小小的珊瑚龙虾饰品，可以佩带在她的挂表链上。

第二十七章　文学课


幸运之神突然间对着乔微笑了，并在她的人生之路上抛下一枚幸运铜钱。虽说不是金币，但是毫无疑问，即使给她五十万，也不会比以这种方式获得小笔金钱更让她感到由衷的幸福。

每隔几个礼拜，她总是会把自己关在房间里，穿上起稿工作服，全身心地投入小说写作，她自己把这形容为“掉进旋涡”，不把它写完就不得安生。她的起稿工作服是一条黑色的羊毛围裙加一顶黑色的羊毛帽子，上面装饰着一朵可爱的红色蝴蝶结；围裙供她在写作时随意擦笔，清理桌面准备大干一场时，帽子为她拢束头发。爱打听的全家人视帽子为航标灯，当她戴着帽子时，大家都跟她保持距离，只是好奇地偶尔探头问一声：“乔，灵感在燃烧吗？”他们甚至不敢随随便便问这个问题，而是要通过观察帽子来做出判断。如果这件善于表达情绪的行头低低地压在前额，表示艰苦的工作正在进行；若是帽子歪戴着，那是正写到激动之处；要是帽子取下丢在地板上，那就是沉浸在绝望中。进门见到这种场景，大家都会不声不响地退出，只有当红色的蝴蝶结在天才的额头快乐地飞舞时，大家才敢跟乔说话。

她并不认为自己是个天才，但是每当创作欲发作时，就全身心地投了进去。幸福感油然而生，忘记了贫困、烦恼，甚至意识不到恶劣的天气，她安全幸福地端坐在想象的世界里，周围拥有很多在她看来是有血有肉的亲切而真诚的朋友。她废寝忘食，夜以继日，只有在这时候感到自己很幸福，活得很有价值，白天和黑夜都显得太短，哪怕别的方面一事无成。神来之笔通常维持一两个礼拜，然后，她从“旋涡”里出来了，饥饿、困乏、乖戾、沮丧。

一次，她刚刚从这些发作中恢复过来，因推托不掉，便去陪克罗克小姐听一个讲座，好心有好报，此行让她有了新的主意。这是一次教区信徒的活动，讲座内容涉及埃及金字塔。乔纳闷为什么要给这些听众选这样的主题。她只能想当然地认为，这些听众满脑子是煤价和面粉价，生活在比狮身人面像斯芬克斯之谜更难解的谜语中。向这些人揭示法老的荣耀，可以减少社会的弊病。

她们到得早，为了消遣时光，乘克罗克小姐扯起袜跟的空儿，乔玩笑着打量起同排座位上人们的脸来。她的左边是两个主妇，结实的额头上戴着无边的帽子，嘴上在讨论女权问题，手上在梭织着什么。再过去，坐着一对卑微的恋人，他们淳朴地握着对方的手；一个忧郁的老处女从纸袋里掏薄荷糖吃；一位老先生脸上盖着一块印度扎染大头巾，打着盹做听课的预备。她的右边只坐着一个看上去勤奋好学的小伙子，正全神贯注地在读报。

那是一张图文并茂的报纸，乔闲得无聊，一边察看离她最近的画作，一边在心里纳闷，是什么事情需要这么一幅具有情节的插图来进行有缘串联。只见画面上，全副武装的印第安人在悬崖上与扑向他喉咙的恶狼以命相搏；两个狂怒的年轻男子正在附近短兵相接，双脚小得奇特，眼睛大得过分；后面有一个衣衫凌乱的女子在拼命地奔跑，惊恐地张大着嘴巴。小伙子停下阅读，翻页时发现她在看，于是好心地给了她半份，率直地问道：“要看吗？这可是一流的故事。”

乔微笑着接受了，她从小就喜欢与小伙子相处。很快，她就觉得自己纠缠于用爱情、神秘和凶杀编织起来的平凡迷宫之中。这篇故事属于通俗文学一类，里面激情泛滥。作者才思不够，写不出什么东西时，就安排一场大灾难的情节，其中一半人物被清除出局，剩下的一半为对手的覆灭而欢呼雀跃。

“一流的情节，是吧？”当她读到她那半份的最后一段时，小伙子问道。

“我觉得如果努力一把，你我都可以写得这么好。”乔回答说。看他如此欣赏这些垃圾，觉得真逗。

“要是我能写得这么好，那就太幸运了。据说，她靠写这类故事发了财呢。”说着，他用手点了点小说标题下的作者名字：S.L.A.N.G. Northbury[1]。

“你认识她？”乔突然来了兴趣。

“不，但是读了她的全部作品，我有个熟人在这份报纸的办事处工作。”

“你是说，她写这类小说发家致富了？”乔看着画报上那群狂躁不安的人和密密麻麻地装点在版面上的惊叹号，肃然起敬。

“我想是的！她很清楚老百姓的喜好，专写人们喜闻乐见、稿酬丰厚的东西。”

讲座开始了，乔几乎没听。当桑兹教授乏味地讲着贝尔佐尼[2]、胡夫[3]国王、圣甲虫和象形文字时，乔偷偷地记下了报社的地址，斗胆决定要去争取那百元奖金。原来这家报纸的专栏里面在有奖征集轰动性的故事。等到讲座结束，听众们醒来时，她已为自己积累起了可观的财富（报纸稿费不是第一笔了），而且已经沉浸在故事情节的虚构中，只是还未能定下，决斗是安排在私奔之前还是在谋杀之后。

回到家里，她只字没提自己的计划，第二天就投入了工作。妈妈忐忑不安，每当灵感发生燃烧时，母亲总显得忧心忡忡。以前，乔从未写过此类体裁，仅仅满足于为《展翅的雄鹰》报撰写温文尔雅的罗曼史。她的演戏经历和博览群书这下可帮上了大忙，不但形成了戏剧性效果的概念，还提供了情节、语言和特定时代的服饰。她尽可能地调用自己对不安情绪的有限理解，努力让故事充满绝望和冒险，背景着落在里斯本，结局安排为一场大地震，真是令人震撼，又合乎情理。稿件悄悄地寄出去了，并附上一张便条，上面用谦虚口吻写道：故事能否获奖，笔者几乎不敢奢望，若编辑部认为拙作有哪怕一点点的价值，些许小钱她也将乐意接受。

六个礼拜是漫长的等待，这对一个还须保守秘密的姑娘来说，就显得更为旷日持久。但是，乔不动声色地等着，就在她要放弃全部希望，觉得再也见不到自己手稿的时候，她收到了一封来信。这封信几乎让她窒息过去，因为就在打开的瞬间，一张一百美元的支票落在了她的膝上。她盯着支票看了一下，仿佛看到了一条蛇，然后，她读着信哭了起来。如果那位和蔼可亲的先生得知，他那封客套信会给一个同胞带来如此强烈的幸福，我想他只要一有机会，定会把全部休闲时间搭上去，并且乐此不疲的。乔看重那封信更甚于奖金，因为它能鼓劲。在多年的努力之后，她发现，自己已经学会了做事，尽管还只是写写煽情故事。这真是令人心花怒放。

世上再没有比她更自豪的小妇人了。这时，她控制住自己的情绪，出现在家人面前，只见她一手举着信，一手举着支票，大声宣布自己得奖了，全家人怔住了。当然啦，大家欢呼雀跃。故事见报后，每个人都读了，一致给予赞美。然而，她的父亲在评论了故事语言通顺、情节新奇而丰富、悲剧气氛令人紧张之后，摇摇头，用一种超凡脱俗的口气说道：

“你可以写得更好，乔。盯住最高目标，别考虑钱。”

“我倒认为这件事情的最大好处是钱。这么多财富你打算怎么打发？”艾美问道，同时用满含崇敬的眼神注视着那张有魔力的纸条。

“让贝丝和妈妈去海边住上一两个月。”乔不假思索地回答。

“啊，太棒了！不，我不能去，乖乖，那样太自私了。”贝丝叫了起来。她拍了拍纤弱的手，深吸了口气，好像渴望着新鲜的海风，然后停下来，推开了姐姐在她面前挥动的支票。

“不，你得去，我已经下定决心。我写小说就为这个，因此才会成功。我只想着自己时，从来干不好事情。你看看，为你写作挣钱也成全了我自己，对吗？而且，妈咪也需要换换空气，她不会丢开你，所以你一定得去。等你长胖了回来，面色红润，那该多好！乔医生万岁！她总能妙手回春！”

一番商量之后，她们俩去了海滨。尽管贝丝回来时不如大家期望的那样长胖了、红润了，但看上去健康多了，而马奇太太则宣布自己感到年轻了十岁。因此，乔很满意对这笔奖金的处理，又心情愉快地投入了工作，争取赚到更多可爱的支票。那一年，她的确赚了好几笔稿费，并开始感到了自己在家里的实力。通过一支魔笔，她写的“垃圾”变成了全家改善生活的福利。《公爵的女儿》付了肉店的账单，《幽灵之手》给铺了新地毯，《考文垂家的诅咒》成了马奇家食品和衣物进项的福音。

财富确是称心如意的东西，但贫穷也有它的光明面。逆境最可贵的功效之一，就是可以激发人们用自己的聪明才智或辛勤双手来争取由衷的满足。世界上的聪明、美好和办事能力，有一半要归功于需要所激发的灵感。乔愉悦地体味着这种快意，不再嫉妒富家姑娘，想到能够负担自己的日常所需，不必求人出一分钱，不觉舒心极了。

她写的小说没有引起人们的关注，却找到了市场。她深受鼓舞，下决心朝名利双收大胆地出击。在誊写了四遍，对着所有知心朋友朗读了一遍之后，她战战兢兢地把她的长篇小说稿交给了三个出版商考虑。最后，终于有了着落，条件是压缩三分之一，删去所有她特别自鸣得意的片段。

“现在我得做个决定，要么把书稿捆回来放在我的铁皮柜里发霉；要么自己掏钱印刷出版；要么迎合买家的意图作些删减，尽量拿点稿费。出名对全家固然是件很好的事，但现金却是更实惠些，所以，想听听大家对这个重要问题的看法。”乔召集了家庭会议，对大家说道。

“别糟蹋了你的书，孩子，其中的价值比你知道的要高，小说的构思很好。让它放着，等成熟了再出版。”这是父亲的建议。他心口如一，积极按照自己布道的内容行事，花了三十年时间，耐心地等待自己的果实成熟，甚至到如今果实已经甜美醇香，他也不急于收获。

“依我看，接受检验比等待更有利于乔。”马奇太太说，“对这类作品而言，评论是最好的检验，会揭示出本人意识不到的优缺点，有助于下次写得更好。我们难免过于偏爱，外界的毁誉对她有好处，即使没什么稿费。”

“对，”乔愁眉不展，“正是这个意思。我折腾这部书那么长的时间，确实不知道它究竟是好，是坏，还是马马虎虎。让冷静而不偏不倚的人看看，然后谈谈他们的看法，对我会是很大的帮助。”

“我倒认为一个字也不能删除。这样做，就糟蹋了这部书。小说的兴趣点在于人物的思想，而不是人物的行动，如果不加阐释地任故事发展下去，就会让读者感到不知所云。”美格说道。她坚信这部小说是迄今为止最出色的。

“可艾伦先生说：‘删去阐释性段落，可使故事简洁而富有戏剧性，要让人物讲故事。'”乔打断了美格，将话题转向出版商的信函。

“就照他说的做。他知道什么样的书有销路，我们不知道。把它弄成一本优秀的通俗小说，尽可能多赚些钱。慢慢地，出了名，就有资格漫笔离题，你的人物中就可以有思想家和玄学家了。”艾美说。她对这个问题持有非常实用的观点。

“唔！”乔笑了起来，“如果我的人物是‘思想家和玄学家’，那可不是我的错，我全然不懂这些东西的，只是有时听爸爸说过。如果我能捕捉到他那些睿智，融进我的小说里，对我来说那更好。行啦，贝丝，你有什么说的？”

“我就是想看到小说尽快出版。”贝丝面带微笑，就说了这么一句，无意识地强调了尽快一词。她那始终孩子般率真的眼睛里，流露出渴望的神态，让乔有一种不祥的恐惧，只觉着心里一阵发冷，从而促使她下决心“尽快”去闯一闯。

于是，这位年轻的女作家怀着斯巴达人的坚毅，把她的处女作放在书桌上，断其筋碎其骨，手法之残忍，不亚于任何一个食人恶魔。为了让大家高兴，她采纳了每一个人的建议，结果就像寓言中的老人和驴，没有一个人中意。

父亲喜欢作品中不知不觉融进去的玄学色彩，因此乔仍保留着，尽管她自己将信将疑。母亲认为细节描写太多，那就大部删除，结果故事中许多必要的过渡都去掉了。美格喜欢悲剧，乔就堆砌了痛苦去迎合她。而艾美反对搞笑的场面，乔怀着生活中最美好的心肠，扼杀了活生生的场景，而这本来是想缓解故事中的忧郁气氛。然后，她砍掉了三分之一，毁灭得真是彻底，还信以为真地寄出了这部可怜的小说，就像一只拔了毛的知更鸟，被放飞到纷繁的世界碰运气去。

嘿，书倒是给出版了，她拿到了三百美元的稿费。表扬和批评纷至沓来，来势比她预期的要大得多。她陷入了困惑的之中，好些时候才恢复过来。

“妈妈，你说过评论会帮助我。可怎么帮？这些评论互相矛盾，我不知道自己到底是写了本前途无量的书，还是违反了基督教全部十诫。”可怜的乔哭着说，双手翻动着一堆短评，细细读去，一会儿让她心里充满自豪和喜悦，一会儿她又感到愤怒和沮丧。“这个人说：‘是一部上好的书，充满了真实、优美、诚挚。一切都很可爱、很纯洁、很健康。'”困惑的女作者接着说道，“下一个说：‘这本书的理论不好，充满了恐怖的虚幻、唯灵的理念和反常的人物。’而我没有任何理论，也不相信唯灵论，我的人物都来自现实生活，我认为这种评论不会是正确的。另一个说：‘这是美国多年来出现的最好的小说之一。’我看不见得；下一个断言：‘尽管它有独创性，写得气势磅礴，表现出极强的感受力，但它是本危险的书。’不是吗？一些人嘲笑挖苦，一些人夸张过奖，几乎所有的人都强调说我有深厚的理论功底，可我只是为娱乐和金钱而写作。我真希望这部书要么全文出版，要么就干脆不出，我痛恨被人如此曲解。”

家人和朋友们时时都来安慰她，表扬她。然而对敏感、心高气傲的乔来说，这是个艰难的时刻，她出发点很好，却显然把事情做砸了。但这对她有好处，因为具有真知灼见的评论者，提出的批评对一个作者来说是最好的教育。最初的悲伤熬过去以后，她能嘲笑自己那本可怜的书了，尽管如此，她依然相信它有价值。经历了这次打击，她感到自己更聪明，更坚强了。

“我不是济慈那样的天才人物，这不能把我棒杀的。”她刚强地说。“别忘了，我还可以嘲笑他们呢，直接取材于现实生活的部分，居然被他们说成是不可能的、荒谬的。而从我愚蠢的脑袋里构思出来的情景，却被说成是‘自然的、温馨的、真实的’。所以我要以此来安慰自己，等我准备就绪，我会振作起来再写一本。”

第二十八章　家务经验


和大多数少妇一样，美格开始婚姻生活时，就下决心做一个模范的主妇，让约翰感到家是个天堂，太太永远笑脸相迎，每天过着优裕的生活，绝不让他衣服上的纽扣少一个。她爱意深厚、精力充沛、心情愉快地做着家务，尽管有一些障碍，但一定要干好。不过，她的天堂并不宁静，因为这位小妇人尽是折腾，过于想让丈夫满意，跑来跑去不亚于真正的马大嫂[1]，操心的事情实在多。她有时累得连笑都笑不起来，约翰顿顿美味佳肴，搞得消化不良，忘恩负义地要吃什么清淡的。至于纽扣，她很快就发现，根本无法知道它们掉在何处。对男人的粗心大意她直摇头，威胁说要他自己钉扣子，要看看他自己钉的扣子是否更经得起那双不耐烦的笨手去折腾。

他们很幸福，虽然他们已经发现，仅靠爱情来维持生活是不行的。约翰认为美格依然美丽，尽管她的微笑隔着熟悉的咖啡壶。美格每天照样得到浪漫的吻别，此时丈夫还会温柔地问：“达令，要差人送些牛肉或羊肉来做菜吗？”小房子不再是辉煌的凉亭，而是一个家了，年轻的夫妇觉得这种变化更好。起初，他们玩儿似的料理家务，孩子似的在家里嬉戏。后来，约翰慢慢地开始做起生意来，他意识到自己肩负着户主的赡养责任。美格则脱下麻纱披肩，系上大围裙，像前面说的那样，毛手毛脚，干劲十足地投入到家务中。

烹饪热情高涨期间，美格通读了科尼利厄斯太太的《食谱》，仿佛在做数学题，耐心细致地解了一道又一道题目。有时候，菜做得味道很不错，量太多了，她就把全家人请来帮着一起吃宴席；有时候，菜做坏了，她就打个包，躲着人，暗地里差洛蒂送给胡梅尔家的孩子们去吃，方便利用嘛。要是哪天晚上她和约翰一起看了账本，烹饪热情通常会暂时消退，节俭冲动继起，可怜的户主只能吃面包布丁、大杂烩和反复加热的咖啡了，结果吃伤了他的心，尽管他以难能可贵的坚韧去忍受。然而，在发现调和折中的办法之前，美格在家产中添置了年轻夫妇不能长期没有的——家用腌缸。

家庭主妇都渴望看到储藏室里存有自制蜜饯，于是她热情高涨，着手制备自己的醋栗冻。她让约翰订购一打左右的小罐子和大量的糖，因为他们家的醋栗熟了，得马上处理。约翰坚信，任何事“我妻”均能胜任，自然为她的手艺感到自豪，他决心满足她的要求，把他们家唯一的果实以最中意的形式储存起来供冬天食用。家里来了四打漂亮的小罐子，半桶糖和一个帮助她摘醋栗的小男孩。年轻的主妇把漂亮的头发卷起来塞进小帽子里，袖子挽到手肘，系上一条尽管有护胸但看上去很妖艳的格子围裙，开始干了起来。她毫不怀疑自己能成功，不是数百次地看着汉娜做过的吗？起初那一大排的小罐子让她感到相当吃惊，但约翰是那么喜欢吃果冻，漂亮的小罐子摆在架子上又会是那么可爱，美格决心把它们全部装满，于是，花了整整一天的时间采摘、煮沸、过滤，折腾着她的果冻。她尽了最大的努力，还向科尼利厄斯太太的书请教，绞尽脑汁地回忆汉娜如何处理，而自己遗漏了什么。她再煮、再加糖、再过滤，可是讨厌的东西就是不结冻。

她很想就这样系着围裙带着帽子跑回家向母亲求助，但约翰和她有约定，不管遇到什么麻烦，诸如个人烦恼、缺乏经验、怄气争吵，都不去烦扰任何人。当时，提到“争吵”这个词，他俩都笑了，仿佛这个想法是最荒谬的。但他们遵守自己的约定，无论何事只要能自己解决就都不求人，也没有人出面干预，这也是马奇太太的建议。所以，在炎炎夏日里，美格独自一人捣鼓着那难弄的果酱，到了下午五点，她坐在被搞得乱七八糟的厨房里，搓着沾满果汁的双手，大声地哭了起来。

在令人兴奋的新生活的最初阶段，她经常说：“只要丈夫愿意，他随时可以带朋友来家里。我会时刻准备着。没有忙乱，没有责怪，没有不舒服，却有一个整洁的家，一个快乐的妻子，一桌丰盛的饭菜。约翰，亲爱的，不用征得我的批准，喜欢请谁就请谁，我肯定会欢迎的。”

无可否认，这有多诱人！听了妻子的话，约翰骄傲得神采飞扬，深感有这么一个优秀的妻子是多大的造化。但是，尽管不时有客人来，可每一次都是事先打过招呼的，到目前为止，美格根本就没机会表现自己。在这个眼泪谷般的人世间，总有诸如此类不可避免的事情发生，而我们只能感到惊异，表示悲痛，并尽可能地去忍受。

一年有那么多天，可约翰偏偏选择在那一天带朋友回家吃饭，且事先也不打个招呼，如果没有忘记美格在做果冻的话，他确实是犯了个不可饶恕的错误。他庆幸自己在那天上午已预订了美食，确信它会准时烧好，纵情地想象着这次宴请会产生迷人的效果，漂亮的妻子会跑出来迎接他，他怀着一个年轻主人和年轻丈夫抑制不住的踌躇满志，陪着客人走进自己的宅邸。

约翰走近斑鸠房，发现那扇通常好客地敞开着的门，今天不仅关着，而且还上了锁，台阶上仍然点缀着昨天的泥浆，他感到大失所望。客厅的窗关着，窗帘也拉上了。他看不到身着白色的衣服，头上扎了朵勾人的小蝴蝶结的漂亮妻子在门廊上做针线，也没见目光明亮的女主人羞涩地微笑着迎接客人。什么也没有，连个人影都没有，除了一个看上去很凶的男孩在醋栗树丛下睡觉。

“怕是发生了什么事。斯科特，你在花园待一会，我得去找布鲁克太太。”约翰说道，寂静和孤独使他警觉起来。

顺着糖被烧焦了的刺鼻气味，他匆匆地绕过房子，斯科特表情讶异，不紧不慢地跟在后面。突然不见了布鲁克，他知趣地远远停住了脚步，但他仍能看见听到。作为一个单身汉，他觉得前景非常有趣。

混乱和绝望笼罩着厨房。一批果冻被倒入了一个个罐子里，另一批还摆在地上，第三批正在炉子上欢快地煮着。有着条顿人般冷静的洛蒂正在平静地吃着面包，喝着醋栗酒，果冻仍旧无望地处于液体状态，布鲁克太太则用围裙蒙着头，坐在那里凄惨啜泣。

“我最亲爱的姑娘，出什么事啦？”约翰叫着冲了进来，心情很复杂：见到娇妻手被烫伤心痛，听到痛苦的意外消息心焦，想到花园里的客人暗自惊慌。

“约翰哦，我又累又热又恼又愁！一直干活，彻底累垮啦。你可要来帮我，否则我会没命的！”疲惫的主妇扑到他的怀里，给了他一个不折不扣的甜蜜欢迎，因为她的围裙和地面一样已经受到醋栗汁的洗礼。

“为啥事烦恼，亲爱的？发生了什么可怕的事？”约翰焦急地问，温柔地亲吻着她小帽子上的蝴蝶结，帽子已完全歪斜了。

“是的。”美格绝望地抽噎着。

“那就快告诉我，别哭了。我能承受任何事情，就是受不了你的哭。说出来，亲爱的。”

“那——那果冻凝结不起来，不知道怎么办！”

约翰·布鲁克顿时大笑了起来，不过他以后再也不敢这么笑了。这阵钟声般的纵情大笑，喜欢嘲讽的斯科特听了不知不觉地露出了笑容；而对可怜的美格来说却是雪上加霜。

“就这事？扔出窗外，以后不再烦果冻了。你要吃，我给你买几大罐。看在上帝的分上，别歇斯底里了。我今天邀请了杰克·斯科特来共进晚餐——”

约翰打住了，因为美格一把推开了他。她凄惨地拍拍双手，跌坐进一张椅子里，大声叫着，语气夹杂着愤怒、责备和沮丧：

“请人吃饭，一切都乱糟糟的！约翰·布鲁克，你怎么可以做这种事？”

“嘘，小声点，人在花园里！我把这可恶的果冻给忘了，现在已没有退路了。”约翰说，焦虑的眼睛扫视着一切。

“你应该捎个话来，或者今天早上就告诉我，你应该知道我有多忙。”美格暴躁地继续说，斑鸠急了也会啄人。

“早上还不知道要请客，也来不及捎话，是出来的路上碰到他的。我根本没想到要批准，你一贯说可以随便请人的。我以前还没这么试过，以后要是再这样，罪该万死！”约翰委屈地补充说。

“希望不要这样！立刻把他带走。我不能见他，也没有晚餐吃。”

“嗨，可我要！我让人送来的牛肉蔬菜在哪里，还有你答应做的布丁？”约翰吼着冲向食橱。

“来不及做任何东西。本来打算到娘家去吃饭。很抱歉，我忙不过来了。”美格的眼泪又掉下来。

约翰是个温和的男人，但他也是人。忙碌了一天，回到家里又累又饿，心里充满了希望，却发现家里一团糟，餐桌上空空的，妻子发脾气，这可不利于心平气和、举止文雅啊。然而，他克制住了情绪，要不是不幸说错了一个词，这场小风暴也就平息了。

“我承认，事情乱套了，但是如果你能帮我一把，我们就能过去，而且还可以过得开心。别哭了，亲爱的，只要稍微卖点力，给我们弄点吃的。我们俩都饿扁了，所以吃什么都不在乎。给我们吃点冷盘肉、面包和奶酪，不会要果冻吃的。”

他只是开个善意的玩笑，可“果冻”这个词断送了他的前途。美格认为，暗讽她那伤心的失败太残酷了，他的话使她最后的一丝忍耐也消失了。

“你自作自受，自己解决麻烦吧。我已经筋疲力尽，不想为任何人‘卖力’了。想用肉骨头、粗面包和奶酪待客，像什么话。我不想让这种事发生在我的家里。把那斯科特带到妈妈家去，告诉他我不在，病了，死了，随你怎么说。我不想见他，你们俩尽管嘲笑我，嘲笑我的果冻。在这里你们别想吃别的。”美格一口气发泄完她的挑衅，扔下围裙，冲出战场，到自己的房间里独自伤心去了。

外面两个男人到底做了些什么，她无从知道，但她知道斯科特先生没有被带到妈妈家里去。他俩一起离开后，美格下楼发现餐桌一片狼藉，是大杂烩餐留下的，心里十分恐怖。洛蒂汇报说，他们吃了很多，谈笑风生，主人还命令她扔掉所有的甜原料，把罐子藏好。

美格想去告诉妈妈，但自知犯错的羞耻感和对约翰的忠诚感阻止了她，约翰是残酷了点，但家事不该外扬。草草收拾了一下屋子后，她把自己穿得漂漂亮亮的，坐在那里等约翰来请求原谅。

不幸的是，约翰没有来，他的看法可不一样。他滴水不漏，把此事当成笑话跟斯科特解释，尽可能为小妻子开脱，同时尽地主之谊盛情款待自己的朋友。即兴的晚餐令客人非常满意，允诺下次再来。但是，约翰很不高兴，虽然没有流露出来。他觉得美格让他陷入了麻烦，还在他急难的时候抛弃了他。说是可以随时带朋友回来，可以自由决定，当他信以为真了，却发了火，还责怪他，把他撂在尴尬的处境中，听凭人笑话，听凭人可怜，这不公平。对，的确不公平！必须让美格知道这一点。用餐期间，他内心深处怒火中烧，但是，当忙乱过去了，朋友送走了，他漫步回家去时，一股柔情袭上心头。“可怜的小东西！她努力想让我高兴，这太难为她了。当然是她错了，可她太年轻。我必须耐心地开导她。”他希望她没有回娘家——他讨厌多嘴，也不希望有人干涉。可是，只要想起这件事他就会生气，而后又担心起美格会哭坏了身体，心也就软了。这促使他加快了步子，决心要平和友好，但坚定不移地，绝对坚定地让她知道，她在什么地方没有尽到做妻子的责任。

美格也同样决心要平和友好，但坚定不移地告诉他做丈夫的责任。她内心里很想跑过去迎接他，请求原谅，接受他的亲吻和安慰。相信他肯定会亲吻她，原谅她。可是，她没有这样做，看见约翰过来了，就装着很自然地开始哼起小调，在摇椅上边摇晃边做着针线活，活像休闲的贵太太坐在豪华的客厅里。

约翰因没有看到一个柔弱的尼俄柏[2]而有点失望，但他觉得自己的尊严需要她先道歉，所以就没吭声，只是步态悠闲地走进来，躺在沙发上，说了句非常切题的话：“亲爱的，我们要走进新时代了。”

“我不反对。”美格用同样令人舒畅的口气回答说。

布鲁克先生抛出几个普遍感兴趣的话题，都被布鲁克太太泼了冷水，话题就此凋萎。约翰走到一扇窗前，翻开报纸，仿佛要埋头于此。美格走到另一扇窗前，继续做她的针线，仿佛新的拖鞋圆花饰物是生活的必需品。两人都不说话，看上去都相当平和与坚定，可两人都感到极不舒服。

“天哪！”美格心想，“婚姻生活真费劲，正如母亲所说的，确实需要无尽的爱心和无尽的耐心。”“母亲”这个词又使她想起了很久以前母亲的其他忠告，那时候自己还不相信，声明不接受。

“约翰是个好男人，不过，他有他的缺点，你必须了解他的缺点，容忍他的缺点，也要看到自己的缺点。他是个很有主见的人，但是，如果你平和地与他讲理，而不是不耐烦地与他对抗，他是不会固执的。他喜欢较真，过分拘泥事实，这是优点，尽管你认为是‘折腾’。千万不要有欺骗他的言行，美格，他就会给你应有的信心和你需要的支持。他有脾气，但不像我们发火过后就没事了，他那寂静的怒火很少发作，可一旦发火起来就很难熄灭。要当心，非常当心，不要引火烧身，和睦与幸福取决于维持他的尊重。注意，如果你俩都有错，要首先道歉。要警惕怄气、误会和牢骚，这些往往会走向伤心后悔。”

美格坐在夕阳下做针线，脑海里回忆起母亲的话语，尤其是最后一句。这是他们之间第一次严重的争执。她回想自己那脱口而出的气话真是又蠢又冲，她的愤怒现在看起来太孩子气了。一想到可怜的约翰回到家里见到的是这么一幅景象，她的心软了。她含着眼泪瞥了他一眼，可他没有看见。她放下手头的活计，站起来，心里想着，我要带头说“请原谅”，可他似乎没有听见。她慢慢地穿过房间，强咽下自尊，站到他的身边，然而，他却连头也不回。有一会儿，她感到自己真的做不到，随后又想：“这是开始。我要尽到自己的责任，做到问心无愧。”她弯下腰，温柔地亲吻丈夫的前额。当然，问题统统解决。悔过的吻胜过所有的语言，约翰马上把她拉过来坐在膝上，温柔地说：

“嘲笑不起眼的小果冻罐太不应该了。原谅我，亲爱的。我再也不会了！”

但他还是接着嘲笑，你瞧他，真的，总有几百次吧。后来，美格也自嘲起来。两人都说这是他们有史以来做得最甜的果冻，因为那小小的家用腌缸长期保存了家庭和睦。

后来，美格特意邀请斯科特来共进晚餐，愉快的款待，她为客人端上一道道精心烹饪的美食。在席间，她表现得既快乐又亲切，气氛搞得很诱人。斯科特先生说，约翰是个幸运的家伙，回家时，他一路上直摇头感叹，单身汉的日子真艰难。

那年的秋天，美格有了新的磨难和经历。萨莉·莫法特与她重叙旧情，经常跑到小屋子里来闲聊，或者邀请“那小可怜”到她的大屋子里去玩一天。美格很乐意，阴沉的天气里她经常感到孤独。家人都很忙，约翰夜晚才回来，她在家里除了做做针线活、看看书，或者随便游荡，没事可做，自然而然要养成外出走走的习惯，与朋友聊聊天。看到萨莉的漂亮东西，她渴望自己也有，经常为此而自怜。萨莉很友好，经常想送她些她爱不释手的小玩意儿，但都被美格拒绝了，她知道约翰不喜欢这样。可是，傻傻的小妇人结果还是做出了令约翰深恶痛绝的事。

她知道丈夫的收入，丈夫信任她，她喜欢这种感觉，他不仅把自己的幸福交给她，还把有些男人更看重的钱托付给她。她知道钱放在哪里，可以随意拿，他只要求把花出去的每一分钱都记个账，每月结算一次，只要求她记住自己是穷人妻。此前，她都做得很好，精打细算，小账本的账目记得很清楚，每个月都不必担心交给他过目。但是那个秋天，大毒蛇钻进了美格的伊甸园，像诱惑许多现代夏娃那样诱惑了她，不是用苹果，而是用衣服。美格不想让人可怜自己，使自己感觉寒酸。贫穷令她恼火，她却羞于承认，于是，就时不时地买些可爱的小东西，尽可能安慰自己，这样，萨莉就不会认为她手头拮据。每买一次东西她都有负罪感，因为这些漂亮的小玩意儿很少是必需品，可这些东西花钱不多，不值得担心，于是，小玩意儿在不知不觉中积少成多，逛街的时候，她不再是消极的浏览者了。

然而，小玩意儿累计的花费超乎想象，月底合计账目，总数大得吓人。那个月约翰很忙，把账目的事就全交给了她，接下来的一个月他出差在外。然而，第三个月他来了个季度大结算，让美格永远忘不了。那次结算的前几天，她做出了一件可怕的事情，良心颇为不安。萨莉一直在购买丝绸，美格很想买一块新的——就买一块漂亮的浅色丝绸，用来做参加聚会时穿的衣服。她那件黑色丝绸服太普通了，薄绸晚装只适合姑娘家。马奇姑婆元旦通常给四姐妹每人二十五美元的红包。只要再等一个月就有这笔钱了，这块可爱的紫罗兰丝绸正在削价，只要她敢拿，她是有这个钱的。约翰总是说，他的就是她的，但是这不仅要花掉还没到手的二十五美元，还要从家庭基金里另外拿出二十五美元，他会认可吗？这是个问题。萨莉怂恿她买，并说要借钱给她，她的好意引诱美格失去了自控。就在这个邪恶的时候，店主举起了可爱的亮闪闪的绸缎匹说：“很便宜，我向你保证，太太。”她应答说：“买下吧。”绸料剪下了，钱也付了，萨莉非常高兴，美格也若无其事地笑了，随之就驱车离开了，那感觉如同偷了东西，警察正在追似的。

回到家里，她想努力缓和内心自责的痛苦，于是摊开那可爱的丝绸。但它这会儿看起来没那么银光闪闪了，而且也不适合她。“五十美元”几个字似乎像图案被印在整幅绸料上。她收了起来，可它还是折磨着她，全然没有马上要穿新衣的快乐，倒是像遇上了挥之不去的傻帽胚的幽灵，让她害怕。那天晚上，约翰拿出账本时，美格的心都沉下去了，结婚以来第一次，她害怕起老公来。那双仁慈的棕色眼睛显得很严厉。尽管他看上去异常高兴，她感觉到他已经发现了，只是不想让她知道。家里的账单都付清了，账本记得很有条理。约翰夸奖了她，正在打开他们称之为“银行”的旧皮夹子。美格很清楚里面没什么钱了，这时，她压住了他的手，神经质地说：

“还没看我的个人开销账呢。”

约翰从不要求看她的个人开支账目，但她总是坚持让他看，常常快意于他看见女人需要的奇怪东西时所表现出来的那种男子气的惊异表情，她要他猜“绲边”是什么，强烈要求他说说“抱紧我[3]”是什么，或者让他感到惊奇：由三朵蔷薇花蕾、一小块天鹅绒，和两根绳子组成的小东西，居然可以是一顶无边女帽，还值六个美元。那天晚上，他看上去好像乐于打听她的花费数目，摆出被她的奢侈吓坏了的神情，他经常这样，因为他为精打细算的妻子感到骄傲。

小账本被慢慢地拿出来，摆在他面前。美格站在他的椅子后面，借口要为他疲劳的额头抚平皱纹。她站在那里，越说心里越慌了：

“亲爱的约翰，我很惭愧，最近我确实太奢侈了。你知道，我经常走动，免不了要买些东西。萨莉建议我买，就买了，我的新年红包可以支付一部分。可是买下来就后悔了，因为我知道你会认为我犯错误了。”

约翰笑起来，把她拉到身边，开心地说：“别躲躲闪闪的。即使买了一双天价靴子，也不会揍你的。我为妻子的脚感到自豪，花八九美元买一双靴子没什么大不了的，靴子好就行。”

那双靴子是上一次买的一件小玩意儿，约翰说话的时候眼睛刚刚落在这笔账上。“噢，他看到那可怕的五十美元会说什么！”美格的心颤抖着。

“比靴子更糟，是丝裙。”她以绝望的镇静说道，希望这最糟糕的局面赶快结束。

“是吗，亲爱的，就像曼塔里尼先生[4]说的，‘该死的总数’是多少？”

这不像是约翰的作风，她知道的，只见他抬起头，双眼直视着她，以前她总是时刻准备迎接他这样的目光，并报之以同样坦率的目光。她翻过账页，同时转过头，手指着总数，这个没有那五十元就已经够糟糕的总数，加了这一笔更让她心惊肉跳。一时间屋子里非常寂静，于是约翰慢慢地说话了——她能感觉到他正竭力克制着自己的不满：

“唔，不知道花五十块钱买一件衣服是不是贵了，如今你还得买些花边裙饰来配吧。”

“衣服还没做呢，没有配花边。”美格轻轻地哀叹道，突然想起还要花钱，她有点不知所措了。

“用二十五码丝绸裹一个小女人似乎多了些吧，但我毫不怀疑，我妻子穿上它，会和内德·莫法特的太太一样漂亮的。”约翰冷冷地说道。

“我知道你生气了，约翰，但我没有办法。我并不想浪费你的钱，可没想到那些小玩意儿加起来那么费钱。一看到萨莉想买什么就买什么，看我不买而可怜我，我就克制不住了。我努力想让自己知足，但这很难，我已厌倦了贫困生活啊。”

最后一句话说得很轻，她以为他没听到，但是他听到了。这句话深深地刺伤了他，因为为了美格他已经放弃了许多享乐。话刚出口，她就恨不得把自己的舌头咬掉。只见约翰把账本推开，站起来，话音有点颤抖地说：“我就是怕这一点。我尽力吧，美格。”如果他责骂她，甚或推搡她，都没像这两句话这样使她心碎。她跑过去紧紧搂住他，流着后悔的眼泪，哭着说：“哦，约翰，我亲爱的、善良的、勤快的男孩，我不是这个意思！这太狠毒、太不忠诚、太忘恩负义了，我怎能说出口！天哪，怎能说出口！”

他很善良，马上就原谅了她，也没有一句责备的话。但美格知道，自己做的事、说的话，是不会被很快遗忘的，尽管他可能再也不会提及此事。她曾经许诺永远爱他，不管是富裕还是贫穷，而现在，她，他的妻子，鲁莽花掉了他赚来的钱后还责备他穷。太可怕了，最糟糕的事情还是约翰从此变得沉默寡言，仿佛什么事也没发生，只是他在城里待得更晚，等她一个人哭着入睡后继续挑灯夜战。一个礼拜的悔恨几乎使美格病倒，又发现约翰取消了定制的新大衣，更使她处于绝望的境地，让人看着怪可怜的。她吃惊地问约翰，为什么改变了主意，约翰只淡淡地回答说：“买不起，亲爱的。”

美格没再说什么。几分钟后，他发现她在过道把脸埋进那件旧大衣里撕心裂肺地哭着。

那天晚上，他们彻夜长谈。美格懂得了丈夫贫困了更值得去爱，因为贫困仿佛使他成了铮铮铁汉，给了他力量勇气去独立奋斗，贫困教会他用温柔的耐心去承受和抚慰他亲人的正常渴望和失败。

第二天，她收起自尊去找萨莉，告诉她实情，请她帮忙买下那块丝绸。善良的莫法特太太欣然把它买下了，后来又当作礼物相送，当然她考虑周到，不是马上就送的。然后，美格订购了大衣。约翰回家了，她穿上了它，问他是否喜欢她的新丝绸礼服。可以想象他会如何作答，他会怎样接受送他的礼物，也可以想象随之而来的是什么样儿的快乐场面。约翰回家早了，美格不再外出闲逛。早晨，满怀幸福的丈夫穿上那件大衣，晚上，被最可心的小妻子亲手脱下。冬去春来，到了仲夏，美格有了新的经历，女人一生中最深切最温柔的经历。

一个礼拜六，兴高采烈的劳里悄悄地溜进斑鸠房的厨房，汉娜一手拿锅，一手拿盖击节相拍，给他一阵铙钹作响的欢迎。

“小妈妈好吗？人都哪里去了？为什么不在我回家之前告诉我？”劳里低声地问。

“那乖乖幸福得像皇后！大家都在楼上欣赏着呢。我们不要驱（飓）风在这里刮。去客厅里等着，我把他们叫下来。”应答有点复杂，汉娜欣喜若狂地转身去了。

不一会儿，乔出现了，得意地捧着搁在一个大枕头上的法兰绒包袱。她神情镇定，眼睛却闪闪放光，说话的声音由于某种抑制的感情而显得有点古怪。

“闭上眼睛，伸出双臂来。”她引诱着说。

劳里急忙退进一个角落，把手放到背后，带着一种哀求的姿势说：“不，谢谢你，宁可不抱，我肯定会把它掉到地上，摔碎的。”

“那你就看不到你的外甥。”乔坚决地说着，转身就要走。

“我抱，我抱！只是弄坏了你负责。”劳里听从命令，勇敢地闭上眼睛，让东西放入怀里。听到乔、艾美、马奇太太、汉娜和约翰发出一阵大笑，他睁开眼睛，发现手里有两个小宝宝，而不是一个。

难怪他们要笑，因为他脸上的表情很滑稽，能逗乐一个贵格会教徒。他站在那里，兴奋地看看两个没有意识的小生命，又看看欢闹的众人，那一副惊讶的表情。这时乔兴奋地坐在地上尖叫着。

“双胞胎，天哪！”一时间他只说出这么一句话，接着他转向女人们求救，脸上的表情又滑稽又可怜，“快抱走，求求你们啦！我要笑了，会摔到地上的。”

约翰救过自己的宝贝，一手抱一个，在房间里踱来踱去，好像已经掌握了育婴奥秘，而劳里则笑得眼泪都流下了脸颊。

“这是本季最搞笑的事，不是吗？我不让大家告诉你，打定主意要让你大吃一惊，庆幸自己做到了。”乔喘过气来后说。

“生来从没有这么吃惊过。很可笑吧？两个都是男孩吗？都给取了什么名字？让我再看一眼。乔，扶我一把，天哪，想不到好事成双啊。”劳里回答着，盯着婴儿，那神态就像一只仁慈的纽芬兰大狗看着一对小猫。

“一男一女。很漂亮吧？”爸爸得意地说，望着那蠕动的红皮肤的婴孩愉快地微笑着，仿佛那是羽毛未丰的天使。

“是我见过的最棒的孩子。哪一个是男，哪一个是女？”劳里像井水吊桶杆一样，弯腰仔细观察起两个神童宝贝。

“艾美用法国方式给男孩系上蓝丝带，给女孩系上粉丝带，方便辨认。还有，一个蓝眼睛，一个棕色眼睛。特迪舅舅，亲亲他们。”乔调皮地说。

“恐怕他们不喜欢亲。”劳里说，对这种事总是异乎寻常的难为情。

“他们当然喜欢亲，已经很习惯了。现在就亲，先生！”乔命令道，生怕他会建议一个代理人。

劳里撮起腮帮，遵乔之命，小心翼翼地在每一张小脸上啄了一下，那样子又引来一阵笑声，却把小宝贝们弄哭了。

“你看，早就知道他们不喜欢亲！这个是男孩，你看他在踢腿，挥舞着拳头很像那么回事。嘿嘿，小布鲁克，与你同级别的男人较量拳头去，行吗？”劳里的脸上挨了来回乱打的一小拳，高兴得叫起来。

“男孩准备叫约翰·劳伦斯，女孩可以随母亲和外婆的，叫玛格丽特。我们管她叫戴茜，这样就不会有两个美格了，我想如果没有更好的名字，小男孩就叫杰克吧。”艾美带着当姨妈的神气兴致说道。

“叫他戴米约翰[5]，简称戴米。”劳里说。

“戴茜和戴米——就这么叫！就知道特迪会取名。”乔鼓起掌来。

这一次特迪当然成功了，因为两个孩子到了书尾还叫“戴茜”和“戴米”。

第二十九章　拜访


“快来，乔，时间到了。”

“什么事？”

“你不会忘了答应过的，今天要和我一起作六个拜访吧？”

“我这辈子是做过许多草率傻事，但还不至于疯到这个地步，说要一天作六次拜访，一次就够我难受一礼拜的了。”

“没错，你说过的，是我俩的交易呀。我为你完成贝丝蜡笔画，你好好陪我一起回访邻居。”

“‘如果天气晴朗’，协议中有这句话，我字字句句遵守协议，讨债鬼。可东边有一大堆云，天气不晴朗，我不去。”

“嘿，你这是逃避责任。天气很好，没有下雨的迹象，你一向为自己能遵守诺言而自豪，还是老实一点，尽了你的义务，然后会有半年的安宁。”

那会儿，乔正特别专心地在做衣服，她是家里的外套总管，很居功自傲，因为自己的针线功夫不亚于笔头功夫。刚首次试穿就被人抓差，够恼火的，而且还是在一个七月的热天里盛装外出拜访。她很讨厌那种正式拜访，要不是艾美缠着跟她交易，威逼利诱，是绝不去的。到了眼下这种地步，也无法逃脱，她恨恨地敲击着剪刀，愤愤地说听到雷声了，可最后还是屈服了。她把活儿收起来，无可奈何地拿起帽子和手套，对艾美说，殉道者已经准备好了。

“乔·马奇，你太任性了，圣人也会恼火的！希望你不要打算穿成这个样子去拜访人家。”艾美惊愕地打量着她。

“为什么不行？我的穿着整洁、凉爽、舒服，很适合走在尘土弥漫的热天里。如果人们更在乎我的衣着，而不在乎我这个人，我就不想见他们。你可以穿得又体面又惹人爱，喜欢怎么文雅就怎么文雅。你这样穿戴感觉值得，而我觉得不值，裙饰只能让我烦啊。”

“天哪！”艾美叹气了，“她现在逆反心理发作，若不把她抚顺，会逼得我心烦意乱的。我当然也不高兴今天去，但我们欠了社交的债呀。除了你和我，家里又没人能还这笔债。乔，只要穿得漂亮一点，帮我完成这些礼节，会为你做任何事的。如果你努力，是很会讲话的，穿上了漂亮衣服，看上去也有贵族气派，举止也那么优雅，我真为你感到骄傲的。我不敢一个人去的，去吧，去照顾我。”

“真是个油滑的小丫头，居然这样恭维和哄骗生气的老姐。说什么有贵族气派、有教养、不敢单独出去！真不知道哪一个最荒唐。行，既然非去不可，那我就去，尽力而为。你是此行的司令官，我盲目服从，该满意了吧？”任性的乔突然变成了顺从的小绵羊。

“真是个小天使！来，穿上所有最漂亮的衣服吧，每到一处我会说明如何表现，给人留下美好的印象。我希望人们喜欢你，他们会喜欢你的，只要你努力做到随和一点。梳理个漂亮的发型，帽子放上粉红的玫瑰花。这样很好看，素色的衣服看上去太严肃了。带上你浅色的手套和绣花手帕。我们在美格家弯一下，把白色阳伞借来，你就可以用我的鸽子色阳伞了。”

艾美一边打扮自己，一边对乔发号施令，乔不无抗议地遵命。她唉声叹气窸窸窣窣地穿上自己那件蝉翼纱新衣，忧郁地皱着眉头把帽子的带子系成无可挑剔的蝴蝶结，恶狠狠地拨弄别针把领圈戴上，抖出手帕时挤眉弄眼，手帕上的刺绣刺激她的鼻子，就像眼前的使命刺激她的情绪，还把手挤进了有三颗纽扣和一条穗的小手套。完成这最后一道高雅的工序后，神情痴痴的她转身对着艾美温顺地说：

“太痛苦了，但是如果你认为我这样体面，我会幸福地就义。”

“非常令人满意，慢慢地转过身来，让我好好地看看。”乔旋转着，艾美这里触一下，那里碰一下，然后往后退一步，把头偏往一边，谦和地审视着，“行，不错。你的头饰是我最满意的，玫瑰花配白色的帽子相当迷人。挺直肩背，手放得自然些，别管手套是否太紧。有一样东西对你很配，乔，来，戴上披肩。我用披肩不好看，可它很适合你，很高兴姑婆送给你那条可爱的披肩。虽然素雅，但很美观，臂上的褶子确实有美感。我的斗篷花边居中了吗？我的礼服卷得均匀吗？我喜欢把靴子露出来，因为脚长得漂亮，鼻子可不漂亮。”

“你是漂亮的小东西，总是那么赏心悦目。”乔说着，比划着单手，以鉴赏家的神态看着艾美金色头发上的蓝色羽毛饰物，“请问小姐，我这盛装是一路拖着扫灰尘呢，还是把它拎起来？”

“走路的时候提起来，进屋就放下来。裙摆拖地的款式最适合你，必须学会优雅地拖着裙摆。一个袖口还没有扣上一半，马上扣。如果不注意细节，就永远不会形象完美，可人的整体形象是由细节构成的。”

乔叹口气，扣袖口时把手套的纽扣差点绷掉了。终于，她俩准备就绪，飘然出发了。汉娜在楼上窗口探头望着她俩说：“美得像画儿一样。”

“喂，乔姐，切斯特一家子自命高雅得很。因此，希望你表现出最好的举止。千万不要乱说话，不要有古怪举止，行吗？只要沉着、镇定、安静，这样最保险，最有贵妇气质，你能轻而易举地做到，就一刻钟。”快到第一家的时候，艾美说道。她们已经从美格家借到了白阳伞，并接受了两只手各抱一个婴孩的美格的检阅。

“让我想想，‘沉着、镇定、安静’，行，我想能做到。我曾在舞台上扮演过古板的贵夫人，舞台下就试试看。我的表演能力很强，你会看到的，所以放心吧，孩子。”

艾美看上去放心了，可是调皮的乔死抠着她的话去做。拜访第一家的时候，乔坐在那里，手脚优雅地搁着，裙褶都恰到好处地垂着，平静得像夏天的海面，镇定得像冬天的雪堆，安静得像狮身人面像。切斯特太太提及她的小说是多么令人感动，切斯特小姐们提及晚会、野餐、歌剧和时装的时候，她均以微笑、鞠躬和冷冰冰的“是”或“不”作答，端庄有余。艾美使眼色要她说话，试着引她开口，暗地里用脚捅她，均告徒劳无效。乔娴雅地坐着，好像一点也没察觉，仪态如同莫德[1]的脸，五官端正却冷若冰霜，毫无表情却光彩照人。

“马奇家大小姐太傲慢，是个索然无趣的人！”客人离开关上门，一位切斯特小姐发表议论说，不幸的是被客人听见了。在穿过门廊的整个时间里，乔哑笑着，而艾美对指令失灵一脸反感，自然怪罪起乔来。

“怎能这么曲解我的意思？我只是要适当地端庄点、稳重点，而你却把自己变成了彻头彻尾的泥塑木雕。到了兰姆家可要活络点。要像其他姑娘那样聊聊天，对服饰、卖弄等废话，要表现出应有的兴趣。他们出入上流社会，与他们交往对我们很有价值，我无论如何都要给他们留下好印象。”

“我会很好相处的。我会谈笑风生，你喜欢的任何一点琐事，我都会表现出惊讶和狂喜。我喜欢这样的。我将模仿所谓的‘迷人姑娘’的举止。我能做得到，因为有梅·切斯特做榜样，而且我会迎头赶上。倒是要看看兰姆家会不会说：‘乔·马奇多可爱，多讨人喜欢！'”

艾美担心起来了，这不无道理，乔一旦中了邪，就不知道会在什么地方刹车。看着姐姐移步进入又一个客厅，热情地亲吻所有的年轻小姐，优雅地对着年轻男士微笑，热情地参与聊天，这种状况让旁观者感到吃惊，艾美的脸色值得品味啊。兰姆太太很喜欢艾美，拉着她，硬是要她听自己滔滔不绝地谈论经典传说中什么卢克雷霞的最后攻击，而三个快乐的年轻男士则在附近转来转去伺候着，准备稍有停顿就冲进来把她救走。有鉴于此，她无法脱身去制止乔，而乔似乎是妖精附身，淘气地和兰姆太太一样喋喋不休。有一群人围在她的周围，艾美竖起耳朵想听听在说些什么，断断续续的话使她惊慌不已，睁大的眼睛和抬起的手折磨着她的好奇心，频频传来的阵阵笑声使她很想去分享这种乐趣。听到以下谈话的只言片语，可以想象她内心遭受的痛苦。

“她骑马骑得那么好——是谁教的？”

“没人教。她曾经把一个旧马鞍安在树上，练习过上马、勒马和骑马。现在她什么马都骑，不知道什么是害怕。马房对她降低收费，她驯过的马都能很好地接待女士。她那么迷恋马，我经常对她说，如果其他事干不成，她可以当个驯马师维持生计。”

听到这些糟糕的话，艾美很难克制自己，因为给人的印象是，她是个相当放荡的小姐，而这是她最讨厌的。可是她又能怎么样呢？老太太的故事才讲了一半，离讲完还早着呢。乔又侃开了其他话题，披露出更多可笑的事情，犯了更多可怕的错误。

“是的，那天艾美非常绝望，好马都被骑走了，留下来的三匹，一匹跛足、一匹瞎眼，另一匹脾性犟，要它起步就得往嘴里塞土。游乐聚会上这是好马，是不是？”

“她选了哪一匹呢？”一位男士笑着问，他很喜欢这个话题。

“一匹也没要。她听说河对面农庄里有一匹马驹，不曾有女士骑过，但决定试一试，因为那匹马长得气宇轩昂，精神得很。她的奋斗真是悲壮，还不曾有人给这匹马上过鞍，所以她要上鞍。我的天，她真的驾着它过了河，易如反掌地上了鞍，驭它走向马棚，让那个老头大惊！”

“她骑这匹马了吗？”

“当然骑，而且骑得极痛快。原以为会被摔得支离破碎抬回家，结果她把它驯得很好，她可是那次聚会的灵魂人物呢。”

“唷，我说那是胆量啊！”小兰姆先生转身用赞许的眼光瞥一眼艾美，心里在纳闷，他母亲到底说了些什么，居然让这位姑娘涨得满脸通红而且很不自在。

当话题突然转到服饰的时候，她脸色更红更不自在了。一位小姐问乔，野餐会上戴的那顶漂亮的土褐色帽子是哪里买的。傻乎乎的乔不提两年前买的地方，而是没必要地坦白说：“哦，是艾美在上面涂了颜色。街上买不到那么柔和的颜色的，所以我们喜欢什么颜色就上什么颜色。有一个搞艺术的妹妹，是我们极大的安慰。”

“这不是很有创意吗？”兰姆小姐叫起来，她发现乔很逗。

“与她的某些才气横溢的表演相比，这算不了什么的嘛。这孩子无所不能。嗨，她想穿一双蓝色的靴子参加萨莉的晚会，于是就把自己那双脏兮兮的白色靴子涂成天蓝色的了。那种蓝的好看程度前所未有，很像缎子嘞。”乔补充道，满脸是为妹妹的才艺感到自豪的神情，可把艾美气得真想用名片盒掷她才解恨。

“前阵子读了你写的小说，很喜欢呢。”兰姆大小姐说道，意在恭维这位文学女士。必须承认，此刻文学女士并没有现出本色。

一听有人提起她的作品，乔的反应总是不好，她要么变得生硬起来，像是受到了冒犯；要么用粗话改变话题，如同现在这样。“很遗憾，你没有找到更好的书读。我写那些垃圾是因为好卖，受凡人欢迎。你今年冬天要去纽约吗？”

由于兰姆小姐喜欢她的小说，这么说话就显然不够领情，也不礼貌。乔出口后马上就意识到了错误。怕把事情弄得更糟，她突然记起该自己先提出来告别，行为如此唐突，使得三个人还有一半话留在嘴里。

“艾美，我们得走了。再见，亲爱的，一定要来看我们。期待你们的拜访。不敢邀请你，兰姆先生，不过若是你来了，我想我肯定不忍心打发你走的。”

乔说这话时模仿梅·切斯特过分热情的派头。那种滑稽相，促使艾美尽可能快地冲出了房间，同时强烈地升起一种哭笑不得的感觉。

“我做得还好吧？”离开后，乔踌躇满志地问道。

“没有更糟的了，”艾美全盘否定道，“你着了什么魔会去说我的马鞍呀、帽呀、靴呀的事情，一切的一切？”

“没什么呀，这些事很有趣的，能逗大家高兴。他们知道我们穷，所以，没必要装出我们雇有马夫，一季能买三四顶帽子，能像他们轻而易举地添置东西的样子。”

“不要去对他们说我们的小花招嘛，完全没必要以那种方式来揭自家的穷。你没有一点正常的自尊心，从来就学不会什么时候闭嘴，什么时候开口。”艾美绝望地说。

可怜的乔难为情了，用发硬的手帕默默地拭着鼻头，仿佛在为自己的过错忏悔。

“在这一家我该怎么做呢？”走近第三家别墅的时候她问道。

“爱怎么怎么的，不管你了。”艾美简短地回答。

“那我会过得很愉快的。那些男孩都在家，我们会玩得很痛快。天知道，我需要换点花样，优雅举止对我的身体很不利。”乔粗声粗气地说，她为自己无法适应而烦恼不安。

三个大男孩和几个漂亮孩子的热情欢迎，迅速安抚了她的烦恼心情。乔留下艾美一个人去招呼女主人和碰巧同样来访的都铎先生。她专心致志地与年轻人玩，发觉这新花样很提神。她饶有兴趣地听大学的故事，一声不吭地爱抚着指示犬和鬈毛小狗，欣然同意“汤姆·布朗[2]是条汉子”，全然不顾这种赞美方式不恰当。当一个小伙子提议参观自己的海龟池时，她爽快地跟着走了。这招来妈妈的笑容，慈爱的淑女整一整被子女们的拥抱弄乱了的帽子，熊抱的样子倒很亲切，对她来说比心灵手巧的法国女子制作的无懈可击的发型还宝贝。

艾美听任姐姐自己去玩，自己也尽兴玩乐着。都铎先生的叔叔与一个英国小姐结了亲，这位小姐是在位勋爵的远房亲戚。艾美无限崇敬他们家族，尽管生在美国长在美国，但她还是跟大多数国人一样，对爵位肃然起敬——这是对早期君主信仰的那种默认的忠诚。若干年以前，一个皇家金发男孩到来的时候，这种忠诚曾经使这个阳光下最民主的国家骚动起来，这与年轻国家对古老国家的敬爱也息息相关，就像大儿子对专横的小母亲的爱，母亲有能力的时候拥有儿子，但儿子造反后，便一顿责骂令其远走高飞了。不过，即使与英国贵族远房亲戚的攀谈令人心满意足，也不能使艾美忘记时间，盘桓的分钟数恰到好处时，她留恋不舍地抽身离开了贵族伙伴，去寻找乔，热切地希望那无可救药的姐姐不会处在给马奇姓氏蒙羞的境地。

情况原本可以更糟，但艾美已经认为够糟的了。乔坐在草地上，周围驻扎着一群男孩，一条四爪污秽的狗歇息在她节日礼服的裙摆上，而她正在向心怀钦佩的听众讲劳里恶作剧的故事。一个小孩正在用艾美的宝贝阳伞拨弄海龟，第二个正在乔最好的帽子上吃姜饼，第三个正在用她的手套玩球，所有的人都玩得很高兴。当乔收拾起那被损坏了的财物要离开的时候，她的那一群卫队簇拥着请求她再来：“听你讲有关劳里的玩乐故事真好玩。”

“都是顶好的男孩，不是吗？待了一会儿后，我就感到格外的年轻活泼。”乔说着，把双手背在后面漫步走着，几分是出于习惯，几分是在隐藏弄脏了的阳伞。

“为什么总是躲着都铎先生？”艾美问，明智地避而不谈乔走了形的外表。

“不喜欢他呗，他爱摆架子，慢待姐妹，烦扰父亲，提到母亲很不尊重。劳里说他放荡不羁，我觉得他不值得结识，所以不理他。”

“至少要对他有礼貌吧。你对他只是冷冷地点个头，可刚才对汤米·张伯伦又是鞠躬又是礼貌地微笑。他父亲是个开杂货店的，你对他俩的态度反一反，那才对。”艾美责怪地说。

“不，不行。”乔倔犟地回答说，“我不喜欢，不看重，不钦慕都铎，尽管他的爷爷的叔叔的侄子的侄女是一位爵爷的远房表亲。汤米贫穷、羞涩，但他善良，而且非常聪明。我觉得他好，愿意对他表示恭敬，因为他虽然手里摆弄的是牛皮纸袋，却是个绅士。”

“跟你争论没用。”艾美说。

“是没用，乖乖，”乔打断她的话，“还是让我们显得友好些，在这里留张名片吧，显然，金家都外出了，谢天谢地。”

家庭名片尽了职，两位小姐继续前进。到了第五家，她们被告知小姐们今天有事，乔再次感恩起来。

“现在就回家吧，今天就别管马奇姑婆了。随时可以去她家的，穿着最好的礼服拖过一路灰尘太可惜了，再说我们又累又烦。”

“爱怎么说，就怎么说吧。姑婆喜欢我们穿着入时主动地登门造访。这对我们来说是抬脚之劳，但会给她带来快乐。我认为，这对你衣服的损坏程度不及那几条脏狗和那群野孩子所损的一半。弯腰，让我取掉你帽子上的碎屑。”

“真是个好姑娘，艾美！”乔说着，懊悔地打量一下自己弄坏了的衣服，又瞥一眼妹妹的衣服，她的衣服仍然光鲜无尘，“希望能像你那样，能轻而易举地做些小事情来取悦人。我想过这些，但做这些事情太费时间了，所以总在等待时机搞个大好事，而让小事从身边溜走了，但我看最终还是小事最有效。”

艾美笑了，怒气立刻平息，还带着母爱的神情说：“女人应该学会随和，尤其是穷女人，没有其他方式回报人家给予的善意嘛。如果记住这一点，并照着去做，你会比我更招人喜欢的，你的长处更多呀。”

“我是个坏脾气的古董，而且永远改不掉，但我愿意承认你是对的。只是对我来说，与其违心地去取悦一个人，还不如去为他两肋插刀容易些。我这种爱憎分明太强烈的性格很不幸，是不是？”

“如果你不能掩饰，那是更大的不幸。不瞒你说，我并不比你更认可都铎，但没有人要我对他这么说。你也同样，犯不着因为他不讨人喜欢而使自己显得不随和。”

“但我认为，女孩不认可男孩就要表露出来，除了举止上体现出来，还能怎么做？说教没有用，这一点自从我对付特迪以来就明白了，真悲哀。但是可以从许多小事情上去默默影响他。唉，如果可能的话，对其他人我们也应该如法炮制。”

“特迪是个出类拔萃的男孩，不能用来例证其他男孩的。”艾美说，音调严肃而肯定，这话若被那“出类拔萃的男孩”听到，他会笑得合不拢嘴的，“如果我们是美女，或者有钱有地位，也许能做点什么。但是，因为不认可一些青年就横眉冷对，认可一些青年就笑脸相迎，这样做毫无效果，只能让人觉得我们古怪，像清教徒。”

“所以要默许我们厌恶的人和事，只因为我们不是美女和百万富翁，是不是？这是多好的道德原则。”

“说不过你，我只知道这是处世方式。反对它的人，只会费尽苦心而遭人耻笑。我不喜欢改革家，希望你也不要尝试着去当这个改革家。”

“我的确喜欢改革家，如果可能，我要成为一个改革家。尽管有人耻笑，但这个世界没有改革家就不会进步。我俩观点不对路：你属于旧派，我属于新派。你会生活得很好，但我会活得很有生气。我想我宁愿享受拍砖和起哄。”

“行啦，镇静一下吧，不要用你的新观念去打扰姑婆。”

“我尽量不去烦扰她，可在她面前，我总像是着了魔似的，会突然冒出一些特别不客气的话，或是激进的看法。这是命中注定，我不由自主的啊。”

她们发现卡罗尔婶婶在老太太家里，全神贯注地谈论着某个有趣话题，看到姑娘们进来便放下了话头，用一种窘困的眼神看着她们，这说明她们刚才正在谈论侄孙女们。乔情绪不好，任性劲儿又发作了；但艾美正处在天使般的心境中，她善良地尽到了责任，控制住了情绪，并使每个人都舒心。这种亲情交融的气氛立刻感染了两位长辈，她们亲切地称她为“我的乖乖”，眼神里传达出她们后来加以强调的意思：“这孩子每天都在进步。”

“你是不是要去交易会帮忙，乖乖？”卡罗尔太太问道，艾美坐到她的身边，那种贴心的神情是每个长辈都喜欢的。

“是的，婶婶。切斯特太太问我去不去，我提出看管一张桌子，因为除了时间没有其他东西可出让。”

“我不去。”乔断然插话，“我讨厌受人恩惠，切斯特一家认为让我们去他们亲友满座的交易会帮忙，对我们是个莫大的恩惠。我惊讶你居然会答应，艾美，他们只是要你去干活。”

“我愿意去干活。交易会是为切斯特家办的，也是为自由人办的。他们真好，让我去参加劳动分享快乐。善意的恩惠不会让我烦心。”

“完全正确。我喜欢你的感恩之心，乖乖。帮助那些感激我们助力的人，是件令人愉快的事。有些人并不感激，这令人懊恼。”马奇姑婆一边从眼镜的上面看着乔，一边说道。乔离她有点距离，坐在摇椅上摇着，表情有点郁闷。

要是乔知道一股巨大的福气正在她俩中间徘徊，而平衡点只能落到一个人身上，她马上就会变得像只鸽子的。但是，很不幸，我们的心里没有窗户，看不到朋友的脑子里在想些什么。在普通的事情上，也许看不见更好，但有时候能知道人家在想什么，会是一种安慰，也能节约时间，免得淘气。乔接下来的话，剥夺了自己长达多年的快乐，同时也接受了一个学会管住舌头的适时教训。

“我不喜欢受人恩赐，这样压迫我，让人感到像个奴隶。我宁愿一切事情都由自己做，完全独立。”

“呃哼！”卡罗尔婶婶轻轻地咳了一声，眼睛看看马奇姑婆。

“早就跟你讲过了。”马奇姑婆果断地向卡罗尔婶婶点着头说。

幸好乔不知道自己到底干了什么，她还趾高气扬地坐在那里，一副造反的表情，这种神情随你怎么形容，就是不能说是动人的。

“你会说法语吗，乖乖？”卡罗尔太太把手放在艾美的手上问道。

“相当好，多亏马奇姑婆，只要我愿意她就让埃丝特经常跟我对话。”艾美感激地回答说，这使得老太太的脸上露出和蔼的微笑。

“你的外语怎么样？”卡罗尔太太问乔。

“一个字也不懂。我学任何东西都很笨，受不了法语。法语是那么难缠那么无聊的一种语言。”乔唐突地回答说。

两位老太太再次交换了眼色。马奇姑婆对艾美说：“乖乖，你现在身体相当强壮，是不是？眼睛恢复了，是不是？”

“一点也没有，谢谢你，夫人。我很好，今年冬天我想干些大事，以便那快乐的时光到来时，可以随时动身赴罗马。”

“真是个好姑娘！你应该去，相信你会有这么一天的。”姑婆赞许地拍拍她的脑袋说，艾美则为她捡起了线团。





牢骚鬼，闩上门，坐到炉边纺纱去。





鹦哥正歇息在乔坐椅背后的栖木上，它弯下头来看着乔的脸号叫，仿佛在放肆地质询，神情那么滑稽，不由你不笑起来。

“很会察言观色的小鸟。”老太太说。

“来，散步呀，乖乖？”鹦哥叫着朝瓷器柜跳去，示意要一块糖。

“谢谢，我这就去。走，艾美。”乔结束了这次拜访，更加强烈地意识到拜访的确对她的身体很不利。她以绅士的方式握手道别，而艾美亲吻了两位长辈。两个女孩离开了，留下的印象像阴影和阳光，见其消失在远处的背影，马奇姑婆做出了决定：“玛丽，你最好去安排吧，我出钱。”

卡罗尔婶婶则果断地回答：“我当然会去的，只要她父母同意。”

第三十章　后果


切斯特太太的交易会精致而有档次，被邀请参加交易会并负责一个展台，相邻的年轻小姐们都感到十分荣幸，所以大家都对此事兴致勃勃。艾美接到邀请了，而乔却没有，这对各方面来说都是件幸事，因为她正处在胳膊叉腰的盛气凌人阶段，要教会她如何与人和睦相处，还得让她多摔几个跟头。这个“傲慢无趣的家伙”被无情地排除在一边，而艾美由于是负责工艺品的展台，则其天赋和趣味得到了适时的赏识，她全身心地投入了筹备工作，确保艺术展台有合适的价值作品出现。

一切进展顺利，但交易会开幕的前一天出现了一场小冲突。要知道，老老少少总共有二十五六名太太小姐聚集一起工作，各自都有自己的脾气和偏见，这是不可避免的。

梅·切斯特相当嫉妒艾美，因为对方更受人喜爱，而此时出现的几个小情况，增加了这种情绪。艾美那精致的钢笔画，使梅描画的花瓶黯然失色，这是第一根刺。在最近的一次舞会上，所向披靡的都铎与艾美共舞四次，而与梅只有一次，这是第二根刺。但在她心里翻腾的主要怨情，给她的不友好行为以口实的是，某个仗义的长舌头把流言传给她，说马奇家的小姐在兰姆家嘲笑了她。这事儿本应全部怪乔，她那淘气的模仿太逼真了，旁人一看就知道在模仿谁，爱嬉闹的兰姆家就把这个笑话传了出去。然而，两个始作俑者对此一无所知，所以，艾美听了切斯特太太的话所表现出来的惊愕是可想而知的。得知女儿被人嘲弄，切斯特太太信以为真，当然非常气愤。在交易会开幕的前夕，见艾美正在给漂亮的展台作最后的修饰，她表情冷淡，口气却温和地说：

“乖乖，我发现小姐们对我把这个展台给人家而不给女儿挺有看法。这个展台最显眼，还有人说所有展台中这个最引人注目，而她们是这次交易会的主要张罗者，最好自己来用这个展台。很抱歉，但我知道你对这个交易会一片诚心，所以不会计较个人的小得失。如果你愿意，可以换展台。”

按切斯特太太预先的想象，说这几句官腔话会很容易，但是真到了要说的时候，她发现难以自然地说出口，艾美信任的双眼直视着她，充满了惊讶和苦恼。

艾美感到，此事的背后肯定有问题，但猜不透到底是什么。她觉得自己受到了伤害，而且没有加以掩饰，轻轻地说：“也许你更愿意我一个展台也不用？”

“哎，乖乖，不要生气，求你了。你瞧，这只是应急之计，我的女儿们自然是要带头的，大家认为这个展台最适合她们。我认为这个展台也很适合你，非常感谢你做了那么多，布置得这么漂亮。但是，我们当然必须放弃个人的意愿，我保证让你换个好位置。喜不喜欢那花卉展台？那几个小姑娘在负责那个展台，她们没信心了。你能把它装点得很迷人的，要知道，花卉展台总是诱人的。”

“尤其对男士而言。”梅补充道，她的表情向艾美提示了自己突然失宠的原因。她气红了脸，但没有进一步介意这女孩子的讽刺，而是用意想不到的友善语气回答说：

“听你的，切斯特太太，如果你喜欢，我马上放弃这个展位，去张罗花卉展台。”

“如果你愿意，可以把东西搬过去放到自己的展台上嘛。”梅开口说，看着艾美那些漂亮的搁物架、描绘鲜艳的贝壳、精致小巧的灯饰，她内心有点过意不去。毕竟，这些都是艾美精心制作、别致地摆放的东西。她的本意是友善的，但艾美误会了，抢着说：

“哦，当然，如果它们碍事的话。”说着她就把自己的东西一股脑儿揽进围裙里走开了，深感自己和自己的艺术品受到了不可饶恕的羞辱。

“哎，她气疯了。天哪，真希望我没叫你去说，妈妈。”梅说着，愁眉苦脸地看着自己空荡荡的展台。

“姑娘们吵架很快就会过去的。”她母亲回答道，但对自己在其中担任的角色感到有点羞愧。她确实也应该感到羞愧。

看到艾美和她带来的宝贝，小姑娘们高兴得欢呼雀跃起来，热忱的欢迎稍稍平息了她烦恼的情绪。她大干起来，决心无法在艺术上成功，就在花卉上取得成绩。但所有的事情似乎都在与她作对。时间来不及了，再说她也很累。每个人都自顾不暇，没法帮她；而小姑娘们只能帮倒忙，乖乖们就知道一惊一乍，唧唧喳喳的像是一帮喜鹊。她们为维护最完美的秩序笨拙地努力，却造成了一大堆的混乱。常春藤拱门竖立起来了，却站不稳，悬挂在上面的吊篮装满花卉后就摇摇晃晃，像是要朝她的头顶砸过来。她最好的瓷砖画溅上了水，结果在爱神丘比特的脸颊上留下一滴黑色眼泪。她使用榔头干活，结果擦伤了手。她在穿堂风口干活，结果患了伤风，更为第二天的活动忧心忡忡。任何一个有同样遭遇的女读者都会同情起可怜的艾美，祝愿她顺利完成任务。

那天晚上，她把情况说了，全家人都对此愤愤不平。母亲说真可惜，但告诉艾美说她做得对。贝丝宣布她绝对不去看交易会，乔问艾美为什么不带上自己所有的漂亮东西走掉，任由那些卑鄙小人去折腾那个交易会。

“没有理由因为她们卑鄙我也跟着卑鄙。我讨厌这种事，尽管我有权表示出我受到了伤害，但不想这么做。这会比怒言愤行更能让她们感觉到，是不是，妈咪？”

“你做得对路，乖乖。用亲吻回报拳头，永远是最好的办法，尽管有时候很难做到这一点。”母亲说，表露出对说得容易做到难深有体会的神情。

尽管嫌怨报复的各种诱惑不时油然而生，但次日艾美还是坚持了自己的决定，用善良的心来克敌制胜。她开局很不错，多亏一个意想不到却非常及时的无声提示。那天上午，她在布置展台，小姑娘们在前庭装花篮，她拿出自己最宠爱的作品——一本小书。封面是古董，是爸爸在宝贝里面找到的，而她在精制的犊皮纸书页上根据不同的主题画上了装饰插图。当她带着那种情有可原的自豪，翻动着画有很多精美图案的书页时，目光落在一行诗句上，于是停下来思考。醒目的鲜红、天蓝、金黄三种颜色的涡形边框衬托着诗句，插图中善良的小精灵在荆棘和鲜花丛里忙上忙下互相帮助。诗句的内容是：“爱邻居当如爱自己。”

“应该爱邻居，但我没有做哇。”艾美想，从鲜艳的书页上抬起头，望着大花瓶后面梅那张不满意的脸。显然，大花瓶遮不住取走可爱的小摆设后留下的空缺。艾美站了一会儿，翻动着手中的书页，每一页都有一些对嫉妒和刻薄的温和指责。在大街、学校、办公室、家里，每天都有人潜移默化地向我们宣讲许多智慧而实在的训诫。如果交易会能宣讲永远不会过时的善良有益的道理，连展台也可以成为讲道坛。艾美内心深处从那本书里得到了一点启迪，当时当地，她铭记在心里，并立刻付诸行动。她做了我们许多人很难做得到的事。

一群女孩站在梅的桌子周围，欣赏着漂亮的东西，议论着调动女销售员的事。她们把声音压得低低的，但艾美知道她们在议论她，想到这些女孩多半是听信一面之词，并做出评判，令人不舒服。但此时的她已有了一个更良善的信念，不久验证它的机会来了。她听到梅忧愁地说：

“太糟了，来不及制作其他东西了，我又不想用零星杂物滥竽充数。当时这张展台已布置好了，可现在全毁了。”

“我保证如果你开口，她会物归原处的。”有人建议说。

“那么折腾过了，怎能说得出口？”梅开口了。但她的话还没说完，展厅的另一边传来了艾美乐呵呵的声音：

“如果你喜欢，不用开口，尽管来拿去好了。我正在考虑主动物归原处呢，它们属于你那个展台，而不是我这个。喏，都在这里，请收下吧，原谅我昨晚匆匆地把它们撤走了。”

艾美点点头，面带微笑，边说边把她的那些宝贝放回去，而后又赶快离开。她觉得做一件友好的事比待在那里等人家道谢更容易。

“我说她可爱，是不是？”一个女孩叫起来。

梅的回答听不见，但另一个小姐冷笑着加了一句。她的情绪显然是调和进了柠檬汁，酸溜溜的：“很可爱，她知道这些东西在她那个展位卖不出去的。”

唉，真让人心寒。我们做出一点牺牲的时候，总希望至少能得到理解和欣赏。有一瞬间艾美甚至感到后悔，觉得善不总是有善报。但她不久发现，善的确有善报。她的情绪高涨起来，展台在她巧手的布置下花团锦簇了。姑娘们也很友好，那小小的举动似乎令人惊异地刷新了气氛。

这一天对艾美来说漫长而难熬，她坐在桌子后面，经常很孤独，小女孩们早就开小差了。几乎没人喜欢在夏天买花，还没到晚上她的花束就开始发蔫了

艺术展台果然最有人气。从早到晚，周围总是有一群人，服务员们得意地抱着咔嗒咔嗒响的钱箱跑来跑去。艾美不时若有所失地望着对面，渴望亲自上阵，那样就会感到自如，感到幸福，就不用晾在角落里无事可做。这对我们当中的一些人来说算不了什么，但对一个漂亮而活泼的姑娘来说，不仅沉闷，而且非常折磨人。一想到晚上家人、劳里和同学们要看到自己窝在那里，就觉得要英勇就义殉道了。

她到夜里才回家，家人见她脸色苍白，沉默不语，就知道那一天很难熬，尽管她没有抱怨什么，也没告诉大家她做了些什么。母亲额外给她沏了一杯热茶。贝丝帮助她穿衣服，还做了一个可爱的小花冠戴在她头上。而乔一反常态，精心地修饰起自己的外表来，神秘地暗示着交易会上的展台要被掀翻[1]，让家人吃惊不小。

“求求你，乔，别做任何鲁莽的事情。我不想乱折腾，让一切过去，你放规矩点吧。”艾美哀求道。她要早点出发，希望能增援鲜花，来振作那可怜的小展台。

“我只是想把自己打扮得迷人一点，让每一个熟人喜欢，让他们在你那个角落里尽可能待得长久些。特迪和他的同学们会助一臂之力的，我们还是会过得很愉快的。”乔回答说。她倚在门口等候着特迪的到来。不一会儿，熟悉的脚步声从暮色中传来，她跑出去迎接他。

“这是我的小伙子吗？”

“就像你是我的小姑娘一样确定！”劳里拽住她的手夹在胳膊下，一副志得意满的神态。

“噢，特迪，居然有这种事！”乔以姐姐的满腔热情讲述了艾美的委屈。

“我的那帮伙计马上就要驾车过来了，我非得让他们买光她的花不可，然后驻扎在她的展台前，否则我就不得好死。”劳里说道，热情地支持她的事业。

“艾美说，那些花一点也不可爱，新鲜的花也可能无法及时到货。我倒不想冤枉别人，也不是多疑，哪怕新鲜的花永远不到货，我也不会感到意外的。做了一件卑鄙的事，很可能会一不做，二不休的。”乔深恶痛绝地说。

“难道海斯没有把我家花园里最好的花采给你们？我吩咐过他的。”

“这倒不知道呀，我猜想他把这事儿给忘了。你爷爷的身体不舒服，所以我不想问他去要，免得让他操心，虽然我很想要一些。”

“哎呀，乔，你怎么能这样想，有什么好问的？花是我的也就是你的。我们不是什么东西都对半分的吗？”劳里应道。他这种语气总是让乔变得浑身带刺。

“得了，我可不想！你的一半东西，有些根本不适合我。不要站在这里说笑了。我得去帮助艾美，你去把自己打扮成帅哥。你要是真的这么好，就叫海斯送一些漂亮的鲜花到交易厅，我会永远为你祈福的。”

“难道现在不为我祈福？”劳里问。乔受不了他这种挑逗的口气，急忙不客气地当着他的面把门关上，透过栏杆叫着：“走开，特迪，我很忙。”

多亏这两位同谋者，那天晚上局面真的扭转过来了。海斯送来了如草原般丰富和水灵灵的鲜花，还送来一个可爱的花篮，用上了他最好的插花技术，放在展台的中心。接着，马奇一家全体上场了，乔特别卖力，成效显著。人们不仅走过来，而且还驻足，冲着她的胡扯哈哈大笑，还赞赏艾美有品位。他们显然都玩得很愉快。劳里和他的同学们殷勤地挺身而出，买光了花束，在展台前安营扎寨，使那个角落成为交易厅里最热闹的地方。艾美此刻如鱼得水，哪怕不是别有用心，就是出于感激之情，也尽可能做到了举止活泼和彬彬有礼。大约在那个时候她得出了一个结论：善人有善报。

那天晚上，乔的表现很恰当，堪称楷模。当艾美被她的仪仗队幸福地簇拥着的时候，乔在交易厅里转悠着，听到了各种闲言碎语，让她明白了切斯特改变初衷的原因。她责备自己，决心尽快去为艾美开脱责任。她也了解到艾美早上就事态都做了些什么，认为她是宽宏大量的模范。经过艺术展位时，她朝展台扫了一眼，想看看妹妹的东西，但都不见了。“恐怕都给藏起来不让人看了。”乔想。她对自己的委屈可以不和人计较，可对家人的侮辱，她可愤愤不平。

“晚上好，乔小姐，艾美那边怎么样啦？”梅用和解的口气问，想让人知道她也能做到很大度。

“她已卖完所有值得卖的东西，现在正尽情享受呢。花卉展台总是诱人的，你知道，‘尤其是对男士而言’。”

乔忍不住反唇相讥，但梅听了后表现得很温和。乔马上就后悔了，她开始赞美起摆在展台上还没卖出去的几个大花瓶。

“艾美的灯饰还在吗？我想给我爸爸买下。”乔说，很想知道妹妹作品的命运。

“艾美的东西早就卖光了，我特意摆在相关人士容易看到的地方，为我们赚了可观的一笔钱呢。”梅回答说。她那一天也跟艾美一样，克服了各种小诱惑。

乔感到很欣慰，急忙回去告诉大家这个好消息，艾美知道了梅的言行后，既感动又惊讶。

“好了，先生们，想让你们去别的展台尽点义务，就像在我的展台一样出手大方——要特别照顾工艺品展台。”她命令“特迪的家丁”出发，姑娘们对大学同学都是这么叫的。

“‘冲啊，切斯特，冲啊！’是那个展台的台训，要像男子汉那样尽你们的义务。从艺术品的角度来说，花出去的每一分钱都是物有所值的。”当义勇军准备冲锋陷阵时，乔按捺不住激动的情绪说。

“言听计从，但马奇比梅漂亮多了。”小帕克说。他拼命想说几句既诙谐又温柔的话，可是劳里迅速制止他说：“很好，孩子，真是个小孩子！”劳里慈父般地拍拍他的头，送他走开了。

“把花瓶买下来吧。”艾美对劳里耳语说，想最后一次以德报怨，让她的敌人感到后悔惭愧。

令梅惊喜不已的是，劳伦斯先生不仅买下了那对花瓶，而且还一手夹着一个，在交易厅里游走着。其他几位绅士同样投机，鲁莽地买下了各种易碎的小玩意儿，然后拿着沉甸甸的蜡花、手工绘画的扇子、金银丝公文包和其他一些实用的适用品，在大厅里瞎逛，茫然不知所措。

卡罗尔太太也在那里，听说了此事，显得非常高兴，把马奇太太拉到角落里不知嘀咕着什么。马奇太太听了非常满意，望着艾美，脸上神情复杂，既自豪又焦虑。不过，她没有说出为什么开心，直到几天以后。

大家都认为交易会圆满成功。梅和艾美道晚安时，没有像往常那样滔滔不绝，只是给了艾美一个深情的吻，脸上的神情仿佛在说：“请原谅，别放心上。”这使艾美感到心满意足。她到家时发现，两个花瓶陈列在客厅的壁炉架上，里面各插着一大束鲜花。劳里吆喝着宣布：“奖给宽宏大量的马奇小姐。”

“艾美，我表扬过你，可你的美德远不止这些。你为人正直、宽宏大量、品行高尚。你举止优雅，我佩服得五体投地。”那天深夜，一起梳头的时候，乔热切地说。

“说得对，她对别人这么宽容，我们都尊重她，爱她。这肯定艰难得要命，要知道，累了这么久，还一心想卖掉自己的漂亮东西呢。要是换了我，我相信，要像你这么宽容，肯定办不到。”贝丝躺在枕头上补充说。

“好了，姐姐们，用不着这么夸我。我做的算不了什么，只是希望别人也会这么待我。我说过要做一名淑女，你们还笑我呢，可我是说真正做言行端正的淑女。我只是按照我理解的去做。到底要怎么做，我说不清楚。小气、愚蠢，还有挑剔，这些都是小毛病，可它们毁了那么多女人，我只是不想这样。现在还做得远远不够，可我会尽力的，希望有朝一日能和妈妈一样。”

艾美说得很热切，乔热情地拥抱她说：“现在懂你的意思了，不会再笑你。你太小看自己了，进步得很快，我要虚心向你学习。我相信，你一定知道秘诀了。继续努力吧，乖乖。总有一天你会得到回报的，到时候，我会比谁都开心。”

一个礼拜后，艾美确实得到了回报，可怜的乔却感到很难开心起来。卡罗尔婶婶来信了，马奇太太看信的时候，脸上闪着喜悦的光芒。真巧，乔和贝丝和她在一起，忙问是什么喜讯。

“卡罗尔婶婶下个月出国，她想——”

“想拉我陪她一起去！”乔插嘴说。她抑制不住心中的狂喜，从椅子上跳了起来。

“不，乖乖，不是你，是艾美。”

“噢，妈妈！她太小了。该先轮到我。我早就想了——这对我很有好处的，太棒了——我非去不可。”

“恐怕这不行，乔。婶婶说是艾美，很肯定，她给了这样的恩惠，我们不能再提条件。”

“怎么老是这样。艾美享乐，我受罪。这不公平，噢，这不公平。”乔激动地喊道。

“这恐怕有一半还要怪你自己，乖乖。那天，婶婶跟我说，你做事太直率，性格太独立，她感到很遗憾。这里她就是这么写的，好像还有你说过的几句话：开始我打算让乔去，可‘恩惠给她负担’，她又‘讨厌法语’，我想我不敢邀请她。艾美更听话，她会成为弗洛的好伙伴的。她知道感恩，懂得这次旅行给她的馈赠。”

“噢，都是我这舌头，这该死的舌头！为什么就不学会闭嘴呢？”乔呻吟道，想起那毁了自己的话。听了乔对信中引用的这些话的解释，马奇太太伤心地说：

“我希望你能去，可这次是无望了。努力吧，开心地接受事实。别抱怨，也别后悔，那样艾美会不开心的。”

“我会尽力的。”乔说着使劲地眨眨眼，然后屈膝拾起刚才因兴奋而打翻的针织篮子，“我要跟她一样，不光看上去开心，而且真的开心。对她的幸福，一点也不嫉妒。可这不容易，这次失意太可怕了。”可怜的乔忍不住流下几滴伤心的泪，打湿了手中鼓鼓的小针垫。

“乔姐，我很自私，不能放你走。同时我很高兴，你暂时还不走。”贝丝一边轻声说，一边把乔和篮子一起抱住。这种执著的拥抱和爱意浓浓的神情，使乔感到莫大的欣慰，尽管她刚才还悔恨交加，恨不得打自己一个耳光，低声下气地恳求卡罗尔婶婶赐她这个恩惠，然后看看她怎样感激地承受这个负担。

等艾美回家时，乔已经能做到与家人同庆了，可能不像往常那样开怀，却也没有抱怨艾美的幸运。这位四小姐也把消息当作特大喜讯，心中一阵狂喜，可她还是不失风度。那天晚上，她开始收拾颜料，整理铅笔，而把衣服、钱和护照之类的小东西留给那些没她那么热衷于艺术憧憬的人去整理。

“姐姐们，对我来说这不仅仅是一次游乐，”她一边刮着那块最好的调色板，一边动情地说，“它将决定我的事业，如果我有任何天赋的话，在罗马就要发掘它出来，而且我将会想办法证实它。”

“假如你没有天赋呢？”乔问。她双眼红红的，正在缝制新的领口，准备把它让给艾美。

“那我就打道回府，靠教绘画过日子。”这个求名者用哲人的沉着口气回答道。但她对这个假如做了个鬼脸，并继续刮着她的调色板，仿佛在放弃希望之前要拼搏一番。

“不，你不会这样结局的。你讨厌苦干，会嫁个阔佬，然后回到家里，荣华富贵过一生。”乔说。

“你的预言有时候灵验，但我不信这个预言会实现。我倒希望我的预言实现，如果自己成不了艺术家，希望能够帮助那些是艺术家的人。”艾美微笑着说，仿佛一个慈善富婆的角色比一个贫穷的绘画老师更适合自己。

“哼！你的希望能实现的，你总是心想事成——而我永远不成。”乔叹口气说。

“你想去？”艾美若有所思地问，用刮刀拍拍自己的鼻子。

“非常想！”

“那行，一两年后我会来接你的。我们一起去古罗马广场发掘文物，实现我们反反复复做出的所有计划。”

“谢谢。当那个快乐的日子果真来临的时候，我会提醒你的承诺的。”乔接受了这个不确定但却是宏伟的邀请，尽力让自己表现出不胜感激之情。

准备的时间没多少，屋子里乱哄哄的，接着艾美便出发了。乔挺住了，表现得不错。可等到那飘动的蓝丝带一消失，她就躲到自己的避难所，在阁楼上哭了个够。艾美也在努力控制自己，直到汽船起航。就在舷梯收起的那一刻，她突然想到，波涛滚滚的大海就要把她和深爱她的家人隔开了。她一把抱住最后一个送客者劳里，哽咽着说：

“哦，替我照顾她们，万一有不测——”

“我会的，乖乖。要是有不测的话，我会来安慰你的。”劳里小声地说，可他怎么也想不到，后来真的被请去履行他的诺言。

就这样，艾美乘船走了，去寻访那个旧世界[2]，可在年轻人看来，它总是那么新奇、美丽。父亲和朋友在岸上目送着她，热切地希望只让好运降临到这个乐天的女孩身上。她也冲着他们挥手，直到什么都看不见了，只有夏日的海面阳光灿烂，金光闪闪。

第三十一章　海外来信


最亲爱的全家：

此刻我真真切切地坐在巴斯饭店内临街的窗前，在伦敦皮卡迪利大街。这旅馆并不是时髦交际场所，但叔叔几年前在这里留宿过，而且不想去别的旅馆。不过，我们没打算长待，所以没什么。噢，我无法一五一十地表达我是多么喜欢这里的一切！恐怕永远不能了，因此只能从记事本中摘录点滴情况给你们寄去，自从出发以来啥事也没干，除了素描和简短潦草地写些东西。

曾在哈利法克斯港发出过一封短信，当时感觉糟极了。但从那以后，日子过得快活起来了，很少生病，整天在甲板上，有许多快乐的人来逗我开心。每个人对我都很友善，尤其是那些军官。别笑，乔，在船上是真的非常需要男士们，可以扶靠他们，他们还可以伺候你。他们没事做，让他们变得有用是一种慈悲，否则，他们恐怕会抽烟抽死。

婶婶和弗洛一路上身体不舒服，喜欢独自待着，所以为她们做了力所能及的事以后，我就出去玩个痛快。多么悠闲地在甲板上散步，多么绚丽的落日，多么清新的空气和壮观的波涛！简直就像当初我们骑上骏马雄赳赳地奔驰一样刺激。真希望贝丝能来，这对她的身体是很有好处的。至于乔，她可能会爬上去坐在主桅前的三角帆上，或者管它叫什么来着的高高的东西上，与轮机员交朋友，在船长的传声筒上咋呼，她会这样喜不自胜的。

一切都美极了，但看到爱尔兰海岸时，我还是很高兴，觉得它非常可爱。郁郁葱葱，阳光灿烂，到处可见棕色的小屋，某些山上还有废墟，山谷里有绅士们的乡间宅邸，狩猎区里有鹿在吃草。天还很早，但起早欣赏美景不感到遗憾。海湾里小船很多，岸上风景如画，头顶是玫瑰红的朝霞。这个画面令我毕生难忘。

在昆士顿镇，新认识的一个朋友伦诺克斯先生下船离开了我们。我说起基拉尼湖时，他看着我，叹息着吟诵起来：





噢，你可曾听说过凯特·基阿尼？

她就住在基拉尼湖畔；

她眼睛一瞥，

危险，避之不及，

凯特·基阿尼的目光能致命。





难道不是很荒唐的吗？

在利物浦只停泊了几个小时。那里又脏乱又嘈杂，很高兴能早点离开。叔叔匆匆跑下船，买了一副狗皮手套、一双丑陋而笨重的鞋子和一把雨伞，还把胡子剃成络腮式的了，这可是头等大事。然后，他自吹自擂，这下像个真正的英国人了。可他第一次去擦鞋，擦鞋童一眼就看出前面站着的是美国人，笑嘻嘻地说：“擦毕[1]了，先生。我是用最新美国佬鞋油擦的。”叔叔被逗得哈哈大笑。噢，一定得告诉你们那个荒唐的伦诺克斯做了什么！他让朋友沃德为我订购了一束花，沃德回船与我们同行的。我打开房门就一眼看到了一束漂亮的鲜花，卡片上面写着“罗伯特·伦诺克斯敬献”。好不好玩，姐姐们？我喜欢旅游。

如果不抓紧点，恐怕永远没空写伦敦的事了。这次旅行就像驱车经过一个很长的画廊，有看不完的美景。农舍让我欣喜，茅草屋顶，常春藤爬上屋檐，格子窗户，门口有壮实的妇女，身边带着脸色红润的孩子们。连牛看上去都比我们的更安静些，站在齐膝的苜蓿草中，母鸡满足地咯咯叫着，好像它们从来不会像美国佬的小鸡那样神经质地叫。从来没见过这么完美的颜色——草碧绿、天湛蓝、谷物金黄，森林葱郁，一路过来我欣喜若狂。弗洛也和我一样，我们不停地从这边跳到那边，不想放过每一个美景，而我们正在以时速六十英里向前疾驶呢。婶婶感到疲倦睡觉去了，但叔叔在读他的旅行指南，对任何事物都无动于衷。这就是我们的状况：我跳起来——“噢，那树丛中灰灰的地方肯定是凯尼尔沃思！”弗洛冲到我的舷窗来——“多美呀！我们总有一天要去那里，是不是，爸爸？”叔叔平静地欣赏着自己的靴子——“不行，乖乖，除非你要喝啤酒，否则不会去那里，那是个酿酒厂。”

这样安静了片刻——接着弗洛又叫起来：“天哪，有个绞架，一个人正在往上爬。”“在哪儿，哪儿？”我尖声叫着，往外望，看见远处有两根高高的柱子，之间有一根横梁，梁上挂着几根链条。“是煤矿哪。”叔叔说，单眼一眨。“这儿有可爱的羊群躺着呢。”我说。“看，爸爸，它们是不是很漂亮？”弗洛富有情感地补充了一句。“是鹅群，小姐们。”叔叔回答说。他的语气使我们安静了下来，后来弗洛坐着欣赏起《卡文迪什船长调情记》，而我独享景色。

我们抵达伦敦时正下雨，这是意料之中的。因此，除了雾和雨伞看不到其他东西。我们住下来，打开行李，在大雨间隙买了些东西。玛丽婶婶给我买了些新物品，我走得太匆忙，准备不充分。一顶装饰着蓝色羽毛的白帽子，配上棉布裙衫，还有从没见过的最漂亮的披风。在摄政街购物太棒了。东西都挺便宜，漂亮的丝带只要六便士一码，我买了点备用，但手套要到巴黎买。你们说这是不是有点儿高雅和富有？

叔叔婶婶出去了。出于好玩，弗洛和我叫了辆双轮双座马车出去兜风，后来得知，小姐单独乘出租马车并不时髦。太逗了！我们被木挡板关在车厢里，车夫驾着车子飞快地跑着。弗洛害怕了，她叫我去制止他。可是他在外面，高坐在后面的什么地方，我无法接近。他听不到我的叫声，也没看到我在前面挥动着阳伞，事情就这么着，很无奈，马车哐当哐当一路奔驰，以非常危险的高速拐着每一个弯。终于，绝望之中我看到车厢的顶上有一扇小门，一捅就打开了，一只红眼睛出现了，他用喝醉了的声音说：

“干什么，小姐？”

我尽可能严肃地下达了命令，砰地关上门。“好，好，小姐。”那人让马漫步走着，仿佛去参加葬礼。我又把门捅开说：“稍稍快一点。”于是他又策马奔跑起来，跟前面一样慌张，我们只能听天由命了。

今天天气晴朗，我们到附近的海德公园散步，我们比自己的外表更有贵族气派。德文郡公爵就住在附近。我经常看到他的随从在后门闲逛，惠灵顿公爵的宅邸离这儿也不远。天哪，我看到的都是些什么景象啊！就像《笨拙》杂志的漫画一样好看，胖墩墩的富孀坐在红黄四轮马车里出行，华服仆从脚穿丝绸长袜，身穿天鹅绒外套坐在后面，扑了粉的马车夫坐在车前。伶俐的女佣们带着脸色极红润的孩子，标致的姑娘们看上去半睡不醒，戴着古怪的英国帽子和穿着淡紫色山羊皮衣的小伙子们懒洋洋地闲逛着。身着红色上衣的高个子士兵们，头上斜扣着松饼帽子，样子很滑稽，很想给他们画速写。“洛腾街”法语叫Route de Roi，意思是“国王之路”，可是现在更像是骑术学校。那里的马很棒，男士们骑术很高，尤其是马夫，可是女士们僵硬地骑在马上跳跃着，与我们的规则不一样。我很想让她们看看美国式的飞奔，因为她们穿着单薄的骑装，戴着高帽，驾驭着马儿小跑着，表情很严肃，像玩具诺亚方舟里的女人。这里人人都会骑马，不管是年长的男士、矮胖的妇人，还是小孩。这里的年轻人很会调情，看到过一对情侣交换玫瑰花蕾，纽扣眼里插一朵玫瑰花，很时髦的，我认为这是一个相当好的创意。

下午去了威斯敏斯特教堂，别指望我来描写它，那是不可能的——只能说太宏伟壮观了！傍晚要去看费其特的戏，我生命中最幸福的一天，就在这一站恰到好处地结束了。

午夜

夜色已很深了。但是不告诉你们昨晚发生了什么，就无法在早上把信寄出。你们猜，我们喝茶的时候谁来了？劳里的英国朋友双胞胎弗雷德·沃恩和弗兰克·沃恩！我太吃惊了，要不是看了名片不可能认出他们。他俩都长得很高，还留了腮胡。弗雷德是英国式的英俊。弗兰克身体好多了，只有一点点跛，不用靠拐杖了。他们从劳里的信里得知我们住在这里，便来邀请我们到他们家去。但叔叔不愿意去，所以我们要再找时间回访他们。他们陪我们去剧院看戏，大家都高兴极了。弗兰克全身心地和弗洛攀谈，弗雷德和我谈论过去、现在和将来的趣事，仿佛我们一直都熟悉。告诉贝丝，弗兰克向她问候，听说她身体不好感到很难过。当我谈到乔时，弗雷德笑了，他向“那个大帽子致意”。他俩都没忘记劳伦斯营地，也没忘记一起度过的美好时光。那似乎是很多年以前的事儿了，是不是？

婶婶在墙壁上敲了三次了，必须搁笔了。我真的感到自己像一个放肆的伦敦贵妇人，坐在这里写到这么晚，房间里满是漂亮的东西，脑子里翻腾着公园、剧院、新衣衫。还有那些好献殷勤的男士，他们一声“啊！”，然后用手捻着金黄色的胡子，十足的英国贵族气派。我渴望见到你们大家，尽管我废话连篇。

永远是你们亲爱的艾美　于伦敦





亲爱的姐姐们：

上一封信跟你们谈起过伦敦之旅——沃恩一家真友好，多次为我们举办了愉快的聚会。汉普顿宫和肯辛顿博物馆之行，尤其让我开心——在汉普顿看到了拉斐尔的漫画，博物馆的展厅里满是透纳[2]、劳伦斯[3]、雷诺兹[4]、贺加斯[5]等巨擘的绘画。在里士满公园度过的那一天真快活，享受了地地道道的英国式野餐。那里有很多漂亮的橡树和鹿群，画都画不完。我也听到了夜莺歌唱，看到了云雀腾飞。多亏弗雷德和弗兰克，我们尽情“兜”伦敦，离开的时候不免有些难过。英国人尽管接受你很慢，但是一旦决心接受你了，我想那是再好客不过了。沃恩一家希望冬天在罗马见到我们。要是他们失约，我肯定会非常失望的，因为格莱斯和我已是好朋友了，男孩们也很好——尤其是弗雷德。

瞧，我们刚刚落脚，他就又来了，说是来度假的，要去瑞士。婶婶刚开始显得有点冷淡，但他泰然处之，她也不说什么了。现在我们相处得很好，很高兴他来了，因为他的法语说得很溜，跟本地人没有区别，我不知道没有他，我们会怎么样。叔叔认识不到十个单词，他总是把英语讲得很响，好像声音大一点儿人家就能听懂了。婶婶的法语发音是老式的，弗洛和我自以为很懂，结果发现我们的法语也不怎么样。非常感谢有弗雷德去“说大戏”，叔叔就是这样说的。

我们度过了多么美好的时光！从早到晚观光，中午在轻松愉快的小餐馆里美餐，经历了各种各样好笑的奇遇。下雨的日子里，我陶醉在卢浮宫的绘画里。对其中的一些极品，乔可能会淘气地嗤之以鼻。她没有艺术热情，但我不同，我要尽快地陶冶自己的眼力和品位。她可能更欣赏伟人的遗物，我已看到她所崇拜的拿破仑三角帽和灰色大衣，他儿时的摇篮和他的旧牙刷。还看到了玛丽·安托瓦内特[6]的小鞋，圣但尼[7]的指环，查理大帝[8]的剑，有趣的东西还有许多。回家后可以跟你们谈上好几个小时，但现在没有时间来写。

皇宫是个极其富丽堂皇的地方，有很多珠宝首饰和可爱的东西，我因买不起而几近发疯。弗雷德要给我买一些，我当然不允许。布洛涅树林和香榭丽舍大街tres magnifique[9]。我见过几次皇室成员。皇帝长得很丑，看上去冷酷无情；皇后漂亮但苍白，而且依我看穿着很不得体——紫色的裙衫，绿色的帽子，黄色的手套。小拿泊[10]是个英俊的男孩，他坐在四马大车上，一边与家庭教师聊天，一边向经过的人群飞吻，每一匹马上的御者都穿着红色绸缎短上衣，车前车后各有一个骑马的卫兵。

我们经常在杜伊勒里公园散步，很棒的，虽然我更喜欢古色古香的卢森堡花园。拉雪兹神甫公墓很奇特，那里有许多坟墓看上去像一个个小房间。走近往里望，可以看到一张桌子，桌子上摆着死者的肖像或者画像，桌子周围还有几张椅子，供前来凭吊者坐的。这是非常有法国味的一件事。

我们的房间在里佛利大街，坐在阳台上，可以把这条灿烂的长街尽收眼底。在外面玩了一天很累了，晚上不想动，坐在阳台上聊天真是一种享受。弗雷德很逗，是我见过的青年中最容易相处的人——劳里除外，劳里的举止更有风度。我希望弗雷德黑一点，不喜欢白皮肤的男人。可是，沃恩家很富有，出身名门望族，因此我没觉得他们的黄头发不好，再说我自己的头发更黄。

下礼拜要动身去德国和瑞士。由于要赶路，所以只能给你们草草地写一点。每天记日记，尽量准确记住和清楚描写所见所闻，这是爸爸的建议。这对我也是个很好的练习，这些日记加上我的写生簿，能比这些短信更好地向你们传达此次旅行的情况。

再见，亲切地拥抱你们。

你们的艾美　于巴黎





亲爱的妈妈：

趁我们动身去伯尔尼之前有一会儿空闲，我要告诉您发生了些什么，因为有些事很重要，您一会儿就会明白。

在莱茵河溯流而上太棒了，我只是坐着尽情享受。拿出爸爸的旧旅行指南翻阅着。景色的美难以用语言来形容。在科布伦茨玩得很开心，弗雷德在船上认识了一些来自波恩的学生，他们给我们唱了小夜曲。那是个明月之夜，一点钟左右，弗洛和我被窗口下最动听的乐曲吵醒了。我们飞快地爬起来，躲在窗帘后面窥望，发现弗雷德和学生们在窗下唱着。这是平生见过的最浪漫的情景了——那河，那浮桥、对面岸上的大要塞，月光洒满大地，音乐可以融化石头的心。

他们唱完后，我们扔下去一些花朵，只见他们争抢着，还给看不见的姑娘们送来飞吻，然后笑着走开了，我猜想可能是去抽烟喝酒来着。次日早晨，弗雷德给我看他背心口袋里一朵压坏了的花，看上去很动情。我嘲笑他说，我并没有扔花，是弗洛扔的。这一说似乎让他很反感，他把花丢出窗外，恢复理智了。恐怕我跟这个男孩会有麻烦，现在已经有苗头了。

拿骚的温泉浴场很好玩，巴登巴登也一样。在巴登巴登，弗雷德输了钱，我骂了他。弗兰克不在身边的时候，他需要人照顾。凯特曾经说，她希望他早点成婚，我也同意她的看法，结婚对他有好处。法兰克福令人赏心悦目。我瞻仰了歌德故居、席勒雕像，还有丹尼克[11]的雕塑名作《阿里阿德涅骑豹》，它非常可爱。要是多懂一点希腊神话，就可以欣赏得更好。我不想请教，因为这故事尽人皆知，或者大家都不懂装懂。希望乔能从头至尾给我讲讲这个故事。我应该多读点书，发现自己孤陋寡闻，真苦恼。

现在言归正传——事情就发生在这里，弗雷德刚刚离开。他是那么友好，乐呵呵的，大家都相当喜欢他。在唱小夜曲之前，除了旅伴友谊，我从来没多想。自那晚以后，我开始感觉到月光下漫步、阳台交谈、每天的探险，对他来说不仅仅是好玩了。我没有卖弄风情，妈妈，真的，我永远记着您对我说的话，而且尽力而为。人家要喜欢我，我也没办法。我没有刻意让人家喜欢我。如果我不关心他们，会难过的，尽管乔说我这个人没心没肺。我知道妈妈这会儿会摇摇头，姐姐们会说：“噢，这唯利是图的小东西！”但我已决定，如果弗雷德求婚，我就接受，尽管我自己并没有发疯似的爱上他。我喜欢他，我们在一起相处得很惬意。他年轻英俊，还算聪明，腰缠万贯——比劳伦斯家富裕得多。我想他家不会反对的。我将会很幸福，因为他们都很善良，有教养，慷慨大方，而且他们喜欢我。弗雷德是双胞胎中的老大，我想他会继承产业的，那产业有多棒啊！在市区一条时髦的街上拥有宅邸，不像美国大房子那么花哨，但舒适度高两倍，实实在在的华贵，英国人信奉这种风格。我喜欢，它货真价实。我见过金银餐具、传家珠宝、老仆人，还有乡间别墅的图片，里面有狩猎场、大宅、漂亮的花园和骏马。哦，这些令人心满愿足！我可不愿像一些姑娘那样一味追抢爵位，结果却发现除了爵位啥也没有。我可能是唯利是图，但我对贫穷深恶痛绝，只要能够，我就不想再多忍受一分钟。四姐妹当中必须有一个人嫁得好。美格没做到，乔不愿意，贝丝还不能，所以我来吧，把周围的一切搞得温馨点。我不会跟不喜欢或看不起的人结婚的。这一点你们放心，尽管弗雷德不是我心中的白马王子，但是他言谈举止很得当，如果他很喜欢我，让我随心所欲，我终有一天会喜欢上他的。因此，上个礼拜，这件事一直在我脑子里转着，不由自主地看弗雷德喜欢我的神情。他虽然没说什么，但见微知著呀。他从来不跟弗洛一起走，坐马车，上餐桌，散步，总是靠近我的边上。单独在一起的时候，他显得很动感情，看到有人胆敢与我说话，他会皱眉头。昨晚用餐时，一个奥地利军官盯着我们看，然后对他的朋友说了些什么“美艳金发女郎”，那朋友是个风流倜傥的男爵。弗雷德的脸色就像凶猛的狮子，狠狠地切割着自己盘子上的肉，因用力过猛，肉差点儿飞出了盘子。他不是那种冷静而拘谨的英国人，性子有点暴躁，因为身上流淌着苏格兰人的血，那双漂亮的蓝眼睛可以让人猜到这一点。

哦，昨天傍晚大概日落时分，我们去了城堡，除了弗雷德，他要先去“存局候领”处取信，再来与我们会合。大家都玩得很尽兴，逛遍了遗迹、存放大酒桶的地窖和很久以前选帝侯为英国妻子建造的美丽花园。我最喜欢那个大露台，那里景观令人神往，其他人进屋参观房间时，我就坐在露台上，画着墙上灰色的石狮子头，其周围爬着红色的紫茎忍冬藤。我感到自己仿佛坠入了罗曼史：坐在那里，看着内卡河的溪水翻滚着流入山谷，听着城堡下面奥地利乐队演奏的乐曲，就像故事书中的女孩那样，等待着情人到来。我感觉到有什么事就要发生了，而我已做好了准备。我没脸红，也没颤抖，而是相当冷静，稍微有点儿激动罢了。

后来，我听到有弗雷德的声音，只见他匆匆穿过大拱门来找我。他看上去心烦意乱，所以我完全忘了自己，忙问发生了什么事。他说收到信，要他火速回家，弗兰克病重。他打算乘夜车立刻回家，时间只够说再见。我为他感到很难过，也为自己感到失望。但这种感觉只停留了那么一瞬，因为他握着我的手说：“很快就回来的，不会忘了我吧，艾美？”这种口气，我不可能误解他的意思。

我没承诺，但双眼看着他，他似乎满足了。他来不及了，仅够说说情况，道声再见。一小时后他就出发了，大家都放不下他。我知道他欲言又止，但他曾经暗示过，所以我猜想，他可能答应过父亲暂时不做求婚之类的事。他是个轻率的孩子，而老父亲害怕他娶进一个外国媳妇。不久就会在罗马见面，到了那个时候，如果我没改变主意的话，当他说：“你愿意吗？”我会说：“愿意，谢谢。”

当然这是很私密的事，我只是希望让您了解情况。请不要为我担心，别忘了我永远是您“谨慎的艾美”，我肯定不会鲁莽行事。尽管给我忠告。如果我能做到，肯定言听计从，真希望能与您好好面谈一次，妈咪。爱我，相信我。

永远属于您的艾美于海德堡

第三十二章　柔情的烦恼


“乔，我替贝丝担心。”

“为什么，妈妈？双胞胎出世以后，她看起来特别好。”

“我不是担心她的身体，而是精神状态。我肯定她有心事，希望你能搞它清楚。”

“您为什么这么想，妈妈？”

“她经常独自一人坐着，跟你爸谈话也没像以前多。有一天，我发现她抱着双胞胎掉眼泪。她唱的歌总是很伤感，脸上不时出现一种我无法理解的表情。那不像贝丝，让我很着急。”

“您问过她吗？”

“我试过一两次，她要么避而不答，要么显得很痛苦，我只好不问了。我从不强迫孩子们向我袒露心事，靠自觉的，而且等待时间通常不长。”

马奇太太说着看了一眼乔，可是对方那张脸的表情说明，她一点也没有替贝丝隐瞒的烦躁。乔做着针线，思考了一会儿，说：“我想她长大了，所以开始做梦了，有希望，有恐惧，有不安，可又不知道为什么，也解释不清楚。哎唷，妈妈，贝丝十八岁了，我们都没意识到她长大了，还把她当小孩，忘了她是个女人了。”

“那倒是的，心肝宝贝，真快，你们都长大了。”母亲叹口气微笑着说。

“这是没办法的，妈咪，所以您对所有的担忧必须泰然处之，让您的鸟儿一个一个地飞出巢。我答应绝不飞得很远，如果这样对您有点安慰的话。”

“足慰我心，乔。你在家我总感到很踏实，美格出嫁了，贝丝太弱，艾美太年轻还不能靠她。有苦力活的时候，你总是乐于帮着我做。”

“没什么的。您知道我不怕干苦力活，一个家总要有人干的。艾美擅长精细工作，而我不会。当所有的地毯要清理的时候，或者全家有一半人同时病倒的时候，我就觉得自己得心应手。艾美在国外表现很杰出，家里如果有点什么事，我就是您的帮手。”

“那么，我把贝丝交给你，她会首先对她的乔打开她柔弱的心灵。要非常友善，别让她感到有人在观察或者议论她。要是她能恢复健康和快乐，我就再也没什么心愿了。”

“真是幸福的女人！我可有一大堆心愿呢。”

“乖乖，那都是些什么？”

“先把贝丝的麻烦解决掉，再找您说说我的。它们不是很烦人，所以先搁一搁。”乔做着针线，明智地点点头，让妈妈放下心，至少暂时不必为她担心。

乔在表面上专心做自己的事儿，暗地里却观察着贝丝。她作了许多推测，但都不能自圆其说，最终锁定了一个，似乎能解释她的变化。她认为，一件微不足道的小事，给了她解开秘密的线索，接下来的工作可是需要活跃的想象和爱心去完成了。一个礼拜六的下午，她和贝丝单独在一起。她一边装模作样地忙着写些东西，一边注意着妹妹。妹妹这会儿看上去是异乎寻常地安静。贝丝坐在窗边，手里的活儿经常掉落到腿上，她手托着脑袋，神情沮丧，眼睛凝视着外面毫无生气的秋景。忽然有人从下面经过，吹着口哨，像一只歌喉婉转的乌鸫鸟，接着传来了说话声：“万物宁静！今晚见。”

贝丝吃了一惊，身子往前靠着。她又是微笑又是点头，看着这个过路人，直到他急促而沉重的脚步消失在远处，然后温柔地自言自语：“那个可爱的男孩，看上去是多么强壮、健康和幸福啊！”

“哼！”乔脱口而出，目光仍旧盯着妹妹的脸。这张脸上的兴奋红晕来得快，去得也快，微笑突然不见了，接着一颗泪珠掉在窗台上闪闪发亮。贝丝迅速地将它拂去，担心地瞥了一眼乔。乔正在奋笔疾书，显然她全神贯注于《奥林匹亚的誓言》。可是，贝丝一转头，乔又开始观察她，看到贝丝不止一次地轻轻擦眼睛，侧向一边的脸上透出一种温柔的悲哀。乔禁不住热泪盈眶。她生怕暴露目标，念叨着要去拿些纸，赶紧溜走了。

“天哪，贝丝爱上了劳里！”她在自己房间里坐下，为自认的这一新发现震惊得脸色煞白，“做梦都没想到。妈妈会怎么说呢？不知道他会不会——”乔顿住了，突然想到了什么，脸涨得通红。“如果他不回报她的爱，那会多可怕。他必须爱她。我要让他爱她！”她恶狠狠地对着男孩的照片摇摇头。这张照片挂在墙上，神态淘气，正对着她笑呢。“噢，我们都猛然长大了。美格已婚并当了妈妈，艾美在巴黎出风头，贝丝恋爱了，只剩下我一个有足够理智的人不胡闹。”乔注视着照片，凝神想了片刻，然后舒展开额头，朝着对方那张脸决断似的点点头，说道：“不了，谢谢你，先生。你很诱人，但你比风标还不稳定。因此，你不必写动人的纸条，也不必施展谄媚的微笑。这没有意义，我不会接受的。”

接着，她叹口气，想入非非起来，黄昏时分才回过神来。她下楼重新开始观察，却仅仅证实了她的猜测。劳里常常会与艾美调调情，与乔开开玩笑，可他对贝丝永远是特别的友善温和，不过每个人对贝丝都是这个态度的。因此，没有人认为他喜欢贝丝要比喜欢其他人多一点。事实上，最近全家人都有的印象是，“我们的男孩”越来越喜欢乔了，而乔却不愿听相关的话题，如果有人敢暗示一下，她就会激烈地斥骂。要是他们得知，今年乔和劳里之间曾经互通款曲，或者说想通款曲却被扼杀在萌芽状态了，他们会非常满意地说：“我早就跟你说过了。”乔讨厌“滥情”，而且也不允许这种事情发生，总是在危险初露苗头的时候，用玩笑或者微笑把它挡开。

劳里刚上大学那会儿，他大概每个月要坠入情网一次，但这些小火花炽热而短暂，没有任何伤害。乔感到很好玩，以极大的兴趣听着由追求、绝望、放弃等内容交织起来的故事。每礼拜一次的见面，劳里都会向她掏心。但是有一阵子，劳里停止了对众多神龛的朝拜，他暗示专一的激情，有时候沉浸在拜伦[1]式的忧郁里。于是，他干脆避开温情的话题，给乔写起了富有哲理的便条，同时也变得用功起来。他要让乔知道，他在“钻研”，打算以优异的成绩风光地毕业。这比黄昏的交心、温柔的牵手和含情脉脉的眼睛更合乔的胃口，因为她的脑子比心成熟得早。她更喜欢想象中的英雄，而不喜欢真实的人物，因为当她厌烦他们的时候，想象中的英雄可以关进铁皮橱柜里，什么时候想要了再招出来，而真实的人物就不那么好对付了。

有了重大的发现之后，形势就不一样了：那天晚上乔以前所未有的目光注视着劳里。要不是脑子里有了先入为主的印象，她肯定是看不出什么异样的。贝丝很文静，劳里对她很友善。而此刻，乔的想象力异常活跃，一如快马驰骋，由于长期想象或虚构的写作，一般的常识反而贫乏，使她不能自拔。与平常一样，贝丝躺在沙发上，劳里坐在旁边的一张矮椅上海阔天空地神聊，逗她高兴。她很依赖他每周的“胡编”，而他也从来没让她失望过。但那天晚上，在乔的想象中，贝丝的眼神特别快乐地盯着身边那张充满生气的黝黑的脸，饶有兴趣地听他讲某场激动人心的板球赛事，尽管“抢断贴板球”“击球手撞柱子出局”“左外场中三球”之类的术语，对她来说就像听梵语似的一窍不通。乔还想象，很用心地去看，劳里的举止更亲切了，偶尔还放低声音。他的笑声比平时少了，有时还有点心不在焉，他把阿富汗羊皮袄盖在贝丝的脚上，体贴入微，柔情似水。

“谁知道呢？千奇百怪的事情都已经发生了。”乔想着，在屋子里折腾，“她会把他变成一个真正的天使，他会让那乖乖生活得舒适快乐，只要他们相爱。我看他是无法不爱的，我确实相信他会的，只要我们其他人不挡着路。”

除了自己，其他人都没有挡着路，乔开始感到要尽快把自己处理掉。但去哪儿呢？心中燃烧着为姐妹情谊献身的热情，她坐下来解决这个问题。

且说客厅里的那张旧沙发，简直是十足的沙发鼻祖，又长又宽，软软的、低低的，看上去有点儿破旧，也应该破旧了，因为姑娘们婴儿时期就在这沙发上睡觉、爬行；孩提时期，从它靠背后面掏东西，在扶手上骑马，在沙发下养宠物；姑娘时期，在沙发上歇息疲倦了的脑袋、做着美梦、倾听温柔的话语。她们都爱它，因为它是家庭的庇护所，有一个角一直是乔最喜欢的歇息处。装点老资格沙发的众多枕头中，有一个用马毛织物做成的枕头，圆圆硬硬的有点儿扎人，两端各有一个球形的纽扣。这个不讨人喜欢的枕头是她的特殊财产，她用这个枕头作为防卫武器，也用它来设置障碍，或者用它苛刻地防止自己过度睡眠。

劳里很熟悉这个枕头，有理由对它深恶痛绝，因为在嬉戏喧闹的孩提时代，他遭受过它的无情痛击，现在它经常使他无缘坐到沙发角上那个让他垂涎三尺的紧挨着乔的位子。如果这条“香肠”，他们是这样称呼这个枕头的，竖在那里，这是他可以坐过去休息的信号，如果它平躺着横在沙发上，不管是男是女还是小孩，谁敢动它一下，就会倒霉！那天晚上，乔忘了封锁她那个沙发角，坐下来还没到五分钟，一个庞然大物便出现在她的身边，两只手臂摊开着伸到沙发的背上，两条长腿伸展在前面，劳里满足地叹口气说：

“嘿，真爽。”

“不准说俚语。”乔急速叫着，砰地把枕头扔下。但已经来不及了，没有空间了，枕头滚落到地上，并非常神秘地消失了。

“得啦！乔，别这么浑身带刺了。人家用功了一周，全身瘦了一圈，也该得到爱抚了。”

“贝丝会爱抚你的。我很忙。”

“不，她不愿意我去烦她，而你喜欢那样，除非你突然没兴趣了。怎么样？你不喜欢你的男孩了，想朝他扔枕头了？”

再没听到过比这更能哄人的动人请求了，但乔用一个严肃问题熄灭了“她的男孩”的热情：“这个礼拜给兰德尔小姐送了几束花？”

“一束也没送，我保证。她订婚了，怎么样？”

“我真高兴，你愚蠢的挥霍行为之一，就是给那些你一点儿也不在乎的姑娘们送花送物。”乔继续斥责说。

“我在乎的聪明姑娘，不让我送花和礼物，又让我怎么办？我的感情需要‘出口’。”

“妈妈不赞成调情，即便是开玩笑也不行，而你拼命地调情，特迪。”

“假如能回答说‘彼此彼此’，我愿一掷千金啊。正因为不能，我只说，我觉得这个快活的小游戏无伤大雅，如果大家都明白只是开玩笑。”

“行啦，这玩笑确实显得快活，但我学不会怎么开呀。我试过，因为在人堆里不随大流会难为情，但我似乎毫无长进。”乔说，一时间她忘了好为人师的角色。

“向艾美学习，她在这方面很有天赋。”

“是的，她在这方面确实做得漂亮，从来不会显得玩笑过头。我想，有些人不用努力就天生讨人喜欢，而有些人总是在错误的地方说错话做错事。”

“很高兴你不会调情。看到聪明率直的姑娘，实在令人耳目一新，她不用出洋相就可以做到快活、和善。不瞒你说，乔，我认识的一些姑娘确实有点儿犯贱，我都为她们感到羞耻。我相信她们没有恶意，但是如果知道我们男孩事后怎么议论她们，我想她们会改过自新的。”

“她们也不甘落后的，她们的舌头最刻薄，所以被损得最惨的往往是你们。原因是你们和她们一样愚蠢，不差分毫。如果你们放规矩些，她们也会注意些。但是她们知道你们喜欢听她们废话，所以就大肆说废话，而你们又反过来怪她们。”

“你倒是知道得不少，小姐。”劳里说话的口气中带着优越感，“我们不喜欢嬉戏和调情，有时候是装作喜欢而已。我们绅士间从不鄙薄漂亮谦和的姑娘，始终毕恭毕敬的。你真天真无邪！要是处在我的位置一个月，就会看到一些让你吃惊不小的事情。说实话，我看到任何轻浮冒失的女孩，总是要模仿我们的朋友雄歌鸲的声调说：‘滚开，呸呸，厚颜无耻的贱货！'”

劳里在对待女人问题上所表现出来的矛盾让人觉得很滑稽，忍不住要笑话他。一方面，他对女子谦恭有礼，骑士般的殷勤体贴，不愿意说她们的坏话；另一方面他本能地讨厌那些在时髦社会比比皆是的不贤淑的愚蠢行为。乔知道，世俗的妈妈们认为小劳伦斯是最合格的快婿人选，女儿们对他报以青睐，各种年龄的太太都恭维他，使他成了个花花公子。所以她相当妒忌地牢牢看着他，生怕他被宠坏了。当她发现他依旧信任谦和的女孩时，她内心的欣喜溢于言表。她突然回到苦口婆心的口吻，压低声音说：“如果你必须要有个‘出口’，特迪，那就专心致志地去爱一个你真正敬重的漂亮谦和的女孩吧，别把时间浪费在愚蠢的女孩身上了。”

“你真的这么建议？”劳里看着她，脸上的表情怪怪的，又忧虑又欢喜。

“是的，真的这么建议。但最好等到读完大学，一般说来是这样。这期间你得充实自己，以便能胜任这个角色。你离优秀还差得远呢，配不上——呃，不管这个谦和的女孩是谁。”乔的表情也有点怪，都差点儿把一个名字说出来了。

“我确实不配！”劳里默认了，脸上谦卑的表情是以前没有过的。他垂下眼帘，茫然地用手指绕着乔围裙上的穗子。

“天哪！这绝对不行。”乔心里想着，于是大声地说：“去给我唱个歌听听。我很想听歌，而且总是喜欢听你唱。”

“谢谢你，我宁愿待在这里。”

“噢，不行，这里没地方了。去做正事吧，你块头太大，当不了装饰物。你不是讨厌被系在女人的围裙上吗？”乔引用他自己的逆反言辞来反击他。

“啊，那要看是谁穿着这围裙！”劳里大胆地拧了一下穗子。

“你去不去？”乔喝问，跳起来直奔枕头。

他当即逃开，刚刚唱起“快活邓迪抬起帽子”，她就溜走了，没再露面，直到年轻人怒气冲冲地离开。

那天晚上，乔躺着久久不能入睡，正有点迷迷糊糊的时候，传来了强忍着的抽泣声，她冲到贝丝的床边，焦急地问：“出什么事儿啦，乖乖？”

“以为你睡着了呢。”贝丝哭泣着说。

“宝贝，是不是老毛病？”

“不，是新的，但我能忍受。”贝丝努力忍住泪水。

“详细跟我说说，让我来治，像我平常治那个毛病那样。”

“你治不了，没法治了。”贝丝控制不住自己。她抱着姐姐绝望地哭起来，乔被吓坏了。

“哪里疼？我去叫妈妈好吗？”

贝丝没有回答第一个问题，但是，黑暗中她一只手无意识地按住了胸口，好像就是那里疼，另一只手紧紧抱住乔。她急切地低声说道：“不，不，别叫她，别告诉。我一会儿就好，你躺下来，怜抚我的头，我会安静下来睡着的，真的。”

乔依从了，当她的手温柔地在贝丝滚烫的前额和沾满泪水的眼帘上来回抚摸的时候，心里有很多话想说出来。但是尽管她还年轻，却知道心灵就像花朵，不能粗暴地对待，而是要让它自然地绽放，所以，虽然她自信知道贝丝新伤痛的原因，但她只是用最柔和的声音说：“有什么事让你烦吗，乖乖？”

“是的，乔。”过了好一会儿，贝丝才回答说。

“把它说出来是不是会好受些？”

“不是现在，还没到时候。”

“那我就不问了，请记住，小贝丝，妈妈和我永远会很高兴听你的诉说，如果能帮助你，也肯定会帮的。”

“知道，慢慢会告诉你的。”

“现在疼痛好些了吧？”

“哦，是的，好多了，你真会安慰人，乔！”

“睡吧，乖乖。我在这儿陪着你。”

她们就这样脸贴着脸睡着了，到了次日早晨，贝丝似乎恢复了常态。十八岁的年龄，头疼心痛都持续不长，一句爱语可以跟大多数的病下药。

乔已经打定了主意，酝酿了几天之后，她向母亲透露了自己的计划。

“您那天问我有什么心愿。妈咪，现在就告诉您一个。”她们单独坐在一起时，乔开口了，“今年冬天我想到别的地方去，换个环境。”

“怎么了，乔？”母亲迅速抬起头，似乎乔的话里还有话。

乔一边埋头忙着手中的活儿，一边冷静地答道：“想做点新鲜事。我感到坐立不安，真想出去长点见识，增加才干。我自己的小事情盘算得太多了，需要活动一下。再说，今年冬天我没事做，想试着展翅飞翔一下，到不远的地方去。”

“要飞到哪里去？”

“去纽约。昨天我想到一个好主意，就是这个。你知道，柯克太太给您写过信，要找一个正派人教她的孩子学习，并做些针线活。要找适当的还真不那么容易，可我如果努力一下的话，还是合适的。”

“天哪，怎么会想到去那膳宿大公寓里做用人！”马奇太太满脸惊讶，可并非不开心。

“并不全是做用人。柯克太太是你的朋友——是天底下最善良的人——她会让我过得开心的，这我知道。她家和其他房间隔开，在那里没人认识我的。即使有人认识也没关系，又不是什么见不得人的事，我不用难为情。”

“我也不会。可你的写作呢？”

“换个环境，只会更好。能见识一些新东西，获得新灵感，即使那里空闲时间不多，回家的时候，也可以带回大批新素材，写我的那些垃圾。”

“我相信。你突然想起要走，就这原因吗？”

“不，妈妈。”

“还有其他什么原因，能告诉我吗？”

乔抬起头，可又低了下去，突然满脸通红，吞吞吐吐地说：“也许是我自我感觉良好，也许并不是这么回事，可——恐怕——劳里变得过于喜欢我了。”

“他开始喜欢你，这显而易见，难道你不喜欢他吗？”马奇太太满脸愁容地问。

“哎呀，当然！我一向都很喜欢这个可爱的男孩，为他感到非常自豪，可再要有什么，那是不可能的。”

“乔，真要这样，我很高兴。”

“为什么？求您告诉我。”

“因为，乖乖，你俩不般配。做朋友，你们会很开心，可能经常吵架，很快也就没事了。可我怕你们要是成为终身伴侣，两人就会对抗。你们太相像，太喜欢自由，且不提脾气暴躁、个性很强。你们在一起不可能幸福，婚姻不仅需要爱情，还需要无限的耐心和自制。”

“这正是我的感觉，虽然我表达不来。很高兴您也认为他刚刚开始喜欢我。让他不开心我会很难过的，但不能仅仅出于感激之情而爱上这个亲爱的老伙计，您说对吗？”

“你肯定他对你有这种感情吗？”

乔脸颊上的红晕更深了，她的神情很复杂，高兴、自豪、痛苦，女孩子谈起初恋情人时往往是这样。她回答说：“恐怕是的，妈妈。他没说过什么，但他的表情说明了很多。我想最好在这层纸捅破之前躲开。”

“同意。如果这样做行得通的话，你就去吧。”

乔松了口气，沉吟了一会儿，她笑着说：“莫法特太太要是知道了，会很奇怪您是怎么管教孩子的，她也会很高兴安妮仍然有希望。”

“哎，乔，母亲管教孩子的方法各不相同，但愿望是一样的，都希望看到孩子幸福啊。美格感到幸福，我很满意她的成功。你嘛，我让你去享受你的自由，直到有一天你厌倦了。只有到了那时候，你才会发现还有更甜蜜的东西。现在，我主要关心的是艾美，但她有见识，会应付裕如的。至于贝丝，我不奢望别的，只希望她身体好。顺便说说，她最近两天似乎快活点了。你跟她谈过了？”

“是的，她承认有点烦恼的事，答应慢慢告诉我。我没再说什么，我觉得我知道是什么了。”乔讲了这个小故事。

马奇太太摇摇头，并没把事情想得这么浪漫。她神情严肃，重申了自己的看法，为了劳里，乔应该离开一段时间。

“在计划落实下来以前，先不要告诉他。他还没回过神来，还来不及悲伤，我已经走了。贝丝肯定以为，我是为了过得开心才离开，其实也是这么回事。我不能对她说起劳里。可等我走后，她会安慰他的，替他消除浪漫的意识。这种小挫折他见得多了，也习惯了，很快就会摆脱失恋的痛苦。”

乔满怀希望地说着，可心中挥不去那不祥的预感。这次“小挫折”比其他的更难接受，劳里无法像以前那样轻松地摆脱“失恋”的痛苦。

家庭会议讨论并通过了这个计划。柯克太太欣然接受了乔，答应给她安排舒服的生活环境。家教够她自食其力，空闲时间还可以写作赚钱，新环境和新社交既对她的创作有用，又令人愉快。乔憧憬着纽约的日子，迫不及待地想出发，因为家在她看来已经太狭窄，鸟儿要出巢放飞其不平静的个性和冒险精神。一切准备就绪，她战战兢兢地去告诉劳里，但让她吃惊的是，他居然很平静地接受了。他最近比平常更严肃了，但很快乐。当大家开玩笑说，他要翻开新的一页重新做人时，他审慎地回答说：“是的，我要让这一页永远翻开着。”

乔感到很欣慰，劳里的美德心境来得正是时候，使得她能够轻轻松松地打点行装。而贝丝似乎也更高兴了，乔希望自己正在为所有的人尽力。

“有件事儿我要拜托你，你要特别关照。”出发前夜她说。

“你是说你的那些稿件？”贝丝问。

“不，是我的男孩。请你好好待他，可以吗？”

“当然，我会的，但我替代不了你，他会非常想念你的。”

“这伤不了他，所以别忘了，我把他交给你照看，烦扰他，宠爱他，管着他。”

“为了你，我会尽力的。”贝丝答应着，心里纳闷，乔为什么如此奇怪地看着她。

劳里说再见的时候，意味深长地低声说道：“这样做没有一点好处，乔。我的眼睛盯着你呢，所以你做事要小心，否则，我会赶过去把你带回家的。”

第三十三章　乔的日记


纽约，十一月

亲爱的妈咪和贝丝：

要给你们写整整一本书，有大堆的话要说，尽管我不是在欧洲大陆游历的时髦女郎。那天，等看不到爸爸那亲切的脸庞时，我感到有点伤感，要不是一个爱尔兰妇女带着四个小孩，一路上哭哭闹闹，分散了注意力，我可能会掉下泪来。每当孩子们张嘴哭闹时，我就在座位上扔姜饼糖自娱自乐。

不久太阳出来了，我把这看成是好兆头，心情也好起来了，尽情地享受起旅途的快乐。

柯克太太很亲切地欢迎我，有宾至如归的感觉，尽管这个大房子里满是陌生人。她让我住在阁楼的起居室里，小小的，很可爱，顶楼就这么一间，有一个炉子，向阳的窗下还有一张可爱的桌子。只要我喜欢，随时可以坐在这里写东西的。窗外景色很美，对面有个教堂塔楼，我立刻就喜欢上了我的书房，觉得爬再多的楼梯也心甘情愿。我要教书做针线的育儿室是个舒适的房间，在柯克太太的起居室边上。那两个小女孩挺漂亮的——我觉得她们被宠坏了。但她们听我讲了《七只坏猪》的故事后，就喜欢上了我，我不怀疑自己能成为模范的家庭女教师。

我可以在大桌子上用餐，但宁愿跟孩子们一起吃，至少目前喜欢这样，因为我感到害羞，尽管没人会相信。

“噢，乖乖，别太拘束，就像在自己家一样。”柯克太太母亲似的说，“我从早忙到晚，要管这么一个家，你是可以想象的。但如果我知道孩子们跟你在一起安全，这颗悬着的心就放下了。这个家所有的房间都对你开放，我尽可能把你房间给整得舒适些。如果要交朋友，这房子里有一些人不错。晚上不用工作。有什么问题尽管跟我讲，尽量使自己快活。喝茶的铃响了，我得赶快去换帽子。”她匆匆离开了，丢下我在新窝里打理自己。

我很快就下楼去，看到了令我欣喜的一幕。高大的房子有长长的楼梯，我站在第三段的平台上，等着一个小女佣吃力地上来。只见后面来了个男士，从她手里接过那沉甸甸的煤炭桶，一直拎到上面放在附近的一扇门边，走开时，还友善地点点头，带着外国口音说：“这样好一点。这稚嫩的肩膀经不起这样的重负。”

他是不是好人？我喜欢这样的事情，就像爸爸说的“于细微处见品质”。那天晚上我把此事跟柯太太说了，她笑着说：“肯定是巴尔教授，他总是干这种事。”

柯太太告诉我，他是柏林人，博学、善良，但穷得叮当响，靠讲课养活自己和两个父母双亡的小外甥。他姐姐嫁给了美国人，根据其遗愿，两个孩子得在美国受教育。故事并不浪漫，但我很感兴趣，我很高兴听说柯太太把起居室借给他几个学生使用。客厅和育儿室之间有一扇玻璃门，我要偷偷地看看他，然后告诉你们他的长相。他都快到四十岁了，所以这没什么坏处的，妈咪。

晚茶后，把两个小女孩哄上床，再动手整大针线篮。整个晚上我都静静地在和这个新朋友对话。我要给你们写日记形式的信，每周一封。晚安，余话明天再聊。





星期二，傍晚

今天上午的课上得很活跃，孩子们吵得像是《堂吉诃德》的桑丘，一度我真想统统推搡教训一遍。鬼使神差，我突然灵机一动，就让她们学体操。她们不停做着体操动作，直到最后高高兴兴地坐下来，而且一直保持安静。午饭后，女佣带她们出去散步，我开始了我的针线活，像小保姆梅贝尔一样心甘情愿。我正在庆幸自己学过锁漂亮的扣眼，突然听到起居室的门打开又关上，接着听到有人哼哼，“Kennst du das Land[1]”，像大黄蜂在嗡嗡发声。我掀起玻璃门上窗帘的一角，偷看着。我知道这样做是极不合适的，但挡不住这个诱惑。巴尔教授在那里整理他的书，我好好地打量着他。标准的德国人——矮胖身材，乱蓬蓬的棕色头发，大胡子，鼻子长得不错，这么和善的眼睛是我不曾见过的。听惯了要么刺耳，要么蹩脚的含糊美国腔后，就觉得他的声音特别洪亮悦耳。他穿着很旧的衣服，手很大，除了一口齐整的牙齿，五官长得并不怎么好，但我喜欢他。他头脑聪明，衬衣烫得挺挺括括，看上去很有绅士风度，尽管外套上少了两个纽扣，一只鞋上有个补丁。他嘴里哼着，表情却很严肃。他走到窗前，把风信子球转到朝阳的方向，然后摸摸猫，它像老朋友似的欢迎他。于是，他脸上露出了微笑，此时传来了敲门声，他响亮而轻快地说：

“Herein[2]! ”

我正要逃开，却看见一个小不点儿拿着本大书。我停住了，想看看接下来的一幕。

“囡囡要我的巴尔。”小东西说着，砰地扔下她的书，向他跑去。

“给你巴尔。来吧，让他好好地抱抱，我的蒂娜。”教授说。他笑着抱起她，高举过头顶，她不得不弯下身子用小脸去亲他。

“囡囡要学课课了。”滑稽的小东西说。于是，他把她放到桌子边，打开她带来的大词典，给她纸笔。她乱涂起来，不时地翻一页词典，那胖嘟嘟的小手指在页面上往下移动着，仿佛在查一个词，看上去那么认真。我差点儿忍不住笑起来，暴露形迹。巴尔教授站在一旁，慈父般地撩撩她的秀发，我觉得那一定是亲生女儿，虽然她更像法国人，而不像德国人。

敲门声再次响起，两位小姐出现了，于是我回去做自己的针线活。这会儿我不再偷看，一直很规矩地坐着干自己的事，但仍然能听到隔壁的吵闹声和说话声。一个小姐老是发出很做作的笑声，并且卖弄风情地说：“哎，教授。”另一个小姐的德语发音很糟糕，使他很难保持冷静。

两位小姐似乎都在狠心考验他的忍耐力，不止一次听到他强调说：“不，不，不是这样，你没注意听我说。”还听到一下很响的敲击声，好像是他在用书猛敲桌子，接着是绝望的感叹：“呸！今天一切都乱套了。”

可怜的人，我同情他。小姐们离去了，我再偷看一眼，看看他有没有劫后余生。他似乎筋疲力尽，靠在椅子上，闭着双眼，一直到时钟敲了两下，才猛地跳起来。他把书放到口袋里，好像又要上课了。小蒂娜在沙发上睡着了，他把她抱起来，轻轻地出去了。我猜想他的生活有点艰难。

晚饭时间是下午五点。柯克太太问我，愿不愿意下楼与大家一起吃，因为我有点儿想家，所以愿意去，就想看看同一个屋檐下住着的都是些什么人。我把自己打扮得很得体，跟在柯克太太后面，想溜进去。但是，个儿她矮我高，藏身的努力宣告失败。她给我一个她边上的位子。脸上的热度退下去后，我鼓起勇气东张西望。长桌子坐满了人，每个人都在专心吃饭——男士们尤其专注。他们似乎是计时吃饭，真真切切在狼吞虎咽，吃完马上就消失了。他们中无非有只顾自己的小伙子，有互相倾慕的小夫妻，有一心牵挂着孩子的已婚妇女，还有满脑子政治的老头。我想我不会跟他们多打交道的，除了一个长相甜甜的单身女子，她看上去有点儿花头。

教授冷落在末座，一边坐着个耳朵有点儿背的老头，另一边是个法国男人。他大声地回答着好问的老头，还跟法国人谈些哲学。要是艾美在这里，她会永远别过脸去不理他，因为，很遗憾地说，他的胃口很大，那大口铲进的样子会吓着“尊贵的小姐”的。而我不在乎，因为我喜欢“看人家津津有味地吃”，汉娜是这么说的。教了一整天的傻瓜，可怜的人肯定需要大吃大喝。

吃完饭我上楼的时候，有两个小伙子在门厅的镜子前整理帽子，我听到其中的一个轻声地问另一个：“那个新来的是谁？”

“家庭教师之类的吧。”

“见鬼，她干吗和我们同桌？”

“是老太太的朋友。”

“头脑敏捷，但没有风度。”

“一点也没有。借个火，走吧。”

起先，我很生气，后来不在乎了，家庭女教师和职员一样体面。根据这两位雅士的评论，就算我没有风度，但是我有见识，这是有些人所不具备的。他俩聊着走开了，像两根老烟枪。我不喜欢平庸之辈！





星期四

昨天很平静，教书、做针线，然后在自己的小房间里写东西。小房间很舒适，有灯又有火炉。我道听途说了一些新闻，还被引见给教授。蒂娜的妈妈好像是在本地洗衣房熨烫衣服的法国人。那个小不点儿喜欢上了巴尔先生，只要他在家，她就像小狗儿似的跟着他转。这让他很开心，因为他很喜欢小孩，尽管他是个“光滚（棍）汉”。柯克家的基蒂和明妮对他也很亲热，告诉我有关他的各种故事，他发明的游戏，他带来的礼物，他讲的好听的故事。小伙子们好像要戏弄他，他们叫他“老弗里茨[3]”“德国窖藏啤酒”“大熊星座”，用他的名字取各种绰号。但他像个小孩儿似的，觉得这些称呼好玩，柯太太说了，这样他都能蔼然处之，所以大家都喜欢他，尽管他是个老外。

那个单身女子叫诺顿小姐——富家女，有教养，而且很友善。今天她在餐桌上跟我说话了（我又去大桌子吃饭了，觉得观察人很好玩），邀请我去她房间玩。她有不少好书好画。她认识些有趣的人，显得很友好，所以我也要表现得很和气，也很想进好人的上流社会。只是这个与艾美喜欢的那个上流社会不一样。

昨天傍晚，我在客厅里，巴尔先生进来给柯克太太送报纸。她不在，但明妮像个小大人，很悦人地介绍说：“她是妈妈的朋友，马奇小姐。”

“是的，她很快活，我们很喜欢她。”基蒂补充说，她说话常常令大人难堪。

我们互相鞠个躬，然后都笑了，因为前面古板的介绍和后面坦诚的补充存在相当滑稽的反差。

“哈，对了，我听到这两个小淘气在惹你生气，马奇小姐。如果她们还要这样，叫我一声，我就来。”他说着，皱了一下眉，露出恐吓的样子，这又把小坏蛋们给逗乐了。

我答应说可以，他就离开了。似乎命中注定我要反复见到他，今天出来时路过他的房间，雨伞柄不小心碰到了他的门上。房门马上被撞开了，只见他穿着晨衣站在那里，一只手拿着一只蓝色的大短袜，一只手拿着针线。我忙做解释，匆匆离开了，他却一点也没觉得不好意思，挥挥手，袜子什么的仍拿在手上，大声而愉快地说：

“今天好天气，适合出门。Bon voyage, Mademoiselle[4].”

我一路笑着走完楼梯，一想到可怜的人还要自己补衣服，不禁有点伤感。德国男人会刺绣，这我知道，但织补袜子是另一码事，可不是那么优雅的事儿。





星期六

没什么别的可写，就写写拜访诺顿小姐吧。她的房间里尽是些漂亮的东西。她很可爱，宝贝都拿出来给我看，问我愿不愿意偶尔跟她一起去听讲座和音乐会，做她的陪伴人——如果我喜欢这些东西。她要施恩于我，我敢肯定，柯克太太把我们的情况告诉她了，对方当然完全是出于善意的。我自尊心极强，但来自这些人的这种恩惠我觉得不是负担，所以感激地接受了。

我回到育儿室的时候，起居室里很喧闹。朝里面看了一眼，只见巴尔先生四肢着地爬着，蒂娜骑在他背上，基蒂手持跳绳牵引着他，明妮在给两个小男孩喂芝麻饼。他们在椅子围成的笼子里叫着跳着。

“在玩动物游戏。”基蒂解释说。

“他是我的象象！”蒂娜抓住教授的头发说道。

明妮接着说：“礼拜六下午，弗兰茨和埃米尔都来，妈妈总是随便我们玩喜欢的事，是不是，巴尔先生？”

“象象”坐起来。他的神情和每个小孩一样认真，一本正经地对我说：“我保证是这么回事，如果声音太大了，你就‘嘘’一声，我们会轻声一点的。”

我答应了，只是让门开着，跟他们一样，觉得挺有趣——我从来没见过这么有意思的游戏呢。他们玩捉迷藏，玩打仗游戏，又跳舞又唱歌。直到天色暗了下来，孩子们都上了沙发，挤在教授的周围，听他讲童话故事，诸如送子鸟到烟囱顶上啦，做好事的森林小“精灵”乘着雪片下凡啦。真希望美国人能像德国人那样淳朴自然，你们呢？

太喜欢写信了，要不是考虑到经济问题，会一直唠叨下去的。尽管用的是薄信纸，字也写得很小，可一想到长信要花去的邮票费，我就抖抖的。艾美的来信看过后请即转寄给我。我的小消息跟她的灿烂游记比起来要平淡得多，但我知道你们会喜欢的。特迪学习很用功，没时间给他的朋友们写信吧？替我好好照顾他，贝丝，并请告诉我两个婴儿的情况。非常地爱你们每一个人。

你们忠实的乔

又及，看一遍这封信，发现巴尔居然占了很大的篇幅，但是对奇怪的人，我总是兴趣盎然，再说也确实没有东西可写。上帝保佑你们！





十二月

我的宝贝小贝丝：

这封信写得乱乱的，就直接寄给了你，可能会让你发笑，它会让你了解我的一些情况，尽管很平淡，但也相当逗人。就为这一点，快乐起来吧！经过艾美所谓大力神城般的努力，经过智力和道德上的耕耘，我灌输的幼稚观念开始发芽，小小的嫩枝遂我所愿迎风摇摆了。她们不像蒂娜和那两个小男孩那样有趣，但我尽到了责任，她们也喜欢我。弗兰茨和埃米尔是快乐的小伙子，德国人和美国人个性特点的混合，造就了他们一贯兴高采烈的性格，我十分喜欢。礼拜六下午，不管在室内还是去户外，都是欢闹的时间。天气晴好的时候要出去走走，像是在书院里一样。教授和我得维持秩序，这时候真是好玩！

我们现在是很好的朋友了，已经开始跟他上课。这件事非我能左右，整个过程很逗，得告诉你。从头说起吧，有一天路过巴尔先生的房间，柯克太太把我叫住了，她正在那里翻箱倒柜。

“你见过这样的窝吗，乖乖？进来吧，帮我把这些书整理一下。把东西都给翻遍了，想看看他把我前不久给他的六块新手帕怎么样了。”

我进去了。一边帮她整理着，一边打量着周围，这可真是“一个窝”。满屋子的书和纸头；壁炉架上的海泡石烟斗和旧笛子，像是不能用了；一只没有尾羽的鸟邋遢得很，在一边窗台上唧唧喳喳地叫着，另一个窗台上摆设着一箱小白鼠；稿子上搁着半成品的船只和几根绳子；壁炉前烘着脏兮兮的小靴子。到处是两个得宠小男孩的斑斑痕迹，他把自己变成了他们的奴隶。经过好一番折腾，才找见三条手帕，一条盖在鸟笼上，一条满是墨水，第三条用作垫布而被烤得焦黄。

“这么个人！”性格温和的柯太太笑着说，把遗存物放进了碎布袋，“我猜想另外三条被撕成布条作船索了，或者包扎割破的手指，或者做了风筝的尾巴。真是糟糕，又不能责备他。他漫不经心、脾气温和，让几个男孩骑在头上作威作福。我答应给他洗洗补补，可他忘了把东西拿来，我也忘了查看，有时候他的境况很糟糕。”

“我来替他补吧。”我说，“我不在乎，他也没必要知道。我喜欢——他那么友善，经常帮我拿信，借我书看。”

于是，我把他的东西整理好，还修整好被他奇怪的织补弄得走了形的两双短袜的后跟。我没跟他说，也希望他不会发现，但在上个礼拜的一天，被他逮了个正着。蒂娜老是进进出出，把门开着，所以我能听见他给人上课。我挺感兴趣，也觉得好玩，有了学的念头。我坐在靠近门的地方，正缝补最后一只袜子，耳朵却竖起来，听他给一个新学生上课，尽力想办法听懂，而这个学生也跟我一样笨。女孩走了，我以为他也走了，四周一片寂静。我嘴里忙不迭地念着一个动词，坐在那里摇啊摇的，一副非常可笑的样子。忽然听到一丝欢叫声，抬头发现巴尔先生站在那里看我，无声地笑着，还给蒂娜打手势，叫她不要说破。

“哦！”他说。我停下来，憨头鹅似的瞪着眼。“你偷看我，我偷看你，这不错。只是，我这么说话不会让人开心的，你想学德语吗？”

“想，可是你太忙了。我又太笨了，学不会。”我慌乱地说，脸红得像朵牡丹花。

“这样吧！我们总会挤出时间来的，我们总会找到办法的。很高兴在傍晚可以给你上点课，马奇小姐，因为我要还你这笔账。”他指指我手里的活儿说，“那些所谓善良的女士传来传去地说：‘是的，他是个老傻蛋，不知道我们都做了什么，不会发现袜跟不再有洞，会以为衣服扣子掉了会重新长出来，相信线带会自己连上去。’哈！可是我有眼睛，都看到了。我有一颗心，我知道感恩。来吧，不时地上点课，否则就不要给我和家人做童话般的事儿了。”

这么一来，我当然没话了。再说，这也确实是个好机会，我答应交换互助，并开始实施了。上了四次课后，我发现自己陷入了语法的泥沼。教授对我很耐心，但这对他肯定是痛苦的折磨。他不时略带着点绝望的表情看着我，弄得我不知道是哭好，还是笑好。我哭过，也笑过，眼看着要恼羞成怒，他索性把语法书往地上一扔，冲出了房门。我感到自己很丢人，被永远地抛弃了，但一点也不怪他。我匆匆收拾起自己的纸头，正想冲到楼上痛责自己一场时，他回来了，表情轻松快活，仿佛我是载誉而归。

“现在我们来试试新方法。我俩一起读这些令人愉快的Märchen[5]，不要再啃那本枯燥的书了，那本书给我们惹麻烦，扔到墙角里去。”

他说话态度别提多温和了，随后打开了安徒生童话，很诱人地摆在我面前。我感到更羞愧了，于是就顾头不顾尾地学功课，他看了似乎觉得非常好笑。我忘了害羞，尽最大的努力锲而不舍地（找不出别的词来表达）学着，多音节词读得结结巴巴，凭当时的灵感发音，尽力而为。当我读完第一页，停下来喘口气时，他拍着双手，由衷地叫起来：“Das ist gut[6]!我们学得很好，接下来该我念了。我用德语念，你听着。”他朗读开了，单词从他的嘴里低沉有力地蹦出来，他读得津津有味，有一种视听上的感染力。所幸这个故事是《坚定的锡兵》，你知道，是个滑稽故事，所以我可以笑——我笑了——尽管有一半我听不懂。我也禁不住要笑，因为他是那么认真，我是那么激动，整个事件又是那么滑稽。

打那以后，我们相处得更好了。现在我课文读得相当好了，这种学习方法适合我。我能看出故事里诗歌里含着语法，就像果冻裹着药丸子服用一样。我很喜欢这种教学方法，他似乎也乐此不疲——你说他是不是很好？我想送他圣诞礼物，不敢给他钱。妈咪，请告诉我送什么好。

很高兴劳里显得那么快活忙碌，甚至把烟戒了，头发也留起来了。你瞧贝丝是比我管得好。我不妒忌，乖乖，你尽力而为吧，只是别把他改造成圣人。如果他没有一点正常的淘气，我恐怕就不会喜欢他了。我的信读一点给他，没时间多写，这样做也可以了。感谢上帝，贝丝继续保持那么舒坦。





一月

祝新年快乐，最亲爱的全家！这个家当然也包括了劳先生和那个叫特迪的小伙子。我无法表达对寄来的圣诞包裹有多么的欢喜，直到晚上才收到，其实我都已经不指望了。信是上午收到的，没提及包裹的事。你们是想给我一个惊喜，而我却有点失望，因为有一种感觉，你们不会忘记我。晚茶后坐在房间里，情绪有点低落，就在此刻，这个风尘仆仆的、饱经摔打的大包裹送来了，我一把将它抱住，欢蹦乱跳起来。睹物如见人，令人精神焕发，我照例纵情地坐在地上读着、看着、吃着、笑着、哭着。所有的东西都是我正想要的，都是自做而不是买来的，这更好。贝丝的新“擦墨围兜”好极了，汉娜的那盒姜饼是我的宝贝。妈咪，我肯定会穿上你送的这件漂亮的法兰绒衣服，肯定会仔细阅读爸爸标注过的书籍。谢谢大家，非常感谢！

谈到书，我觉得自己在这一方面变得富裕起来了，因为元旦那一天巴尔先生送给我一部精致的莎士比亚。他很喜欢此书，与他所珍视的德语圣经、柏拉图、荷马、弥尔顿的书籍摆在一块儿，我经常赞美它。他把它取下来，书没有了封面，指出我的名字在上面，“朋友弗里德里希·巴尔赠”，你可以想象，这时候我是一种什么心情。

“你经常说希望拥有藏书。我送给你一本，因为这个盖子（他的意思是封面）里面是个合订本。好好读莎士比亚吧，会有很大帮助的，此书的阅人观点会帮助你读懂现实生活中的人物，然后用你的笔来刻画性格。”

我尽自己所能向他道谢了。现在谈“我的藏书”，好像我有一百本书似的。以前我从来不知道莎士比亚的内容有多么丰富，不过那时候没有一个巴尔跟我解释它。且别笑话他那可怕的名字。它的发音既不是“拜尔”，也不是“比尔”，人们通常是这样叫他的，而是介于两者之间，这种音只有德国人才发得出来。我很高兴，爸爸妈妈都喜欢有关他的故事，希望有一天你们能认识他。妈妈会欣赏他的热心肠，爸爸会欣赏他的聪明脑袋。我二者都羡慕的，有新朋友弗里德里希·巴尔，我感到自己很充实。

因为我没有多少钱，也不知道他的喜好，所以我买了几样东西摆在他房间里，他会意外地发现。这些东西要么实用，要么漂亮，要么好玩。一个新的墨水台摆在桌上，一个小花瓶给他插花。他总是在玻璃杯里插一朵花，或者一点绿色植物，用他自己的话说是，使自己保持朝气；还有一个架子供他搁风箱，这样他就不会把艾美称之为mouchoirs[7]的东西烤焦。我把手绢折成一个大蝴蝶结，像贝丝发明的那种，身子肥肥的，黑黄相间的翅膀，毛纱触须，珠子眼睛。他非常喜欢，把它摆在壁炉台上当作艺术品，可见毕竟是不成功的。尽管很穷，但他不忘记同一屋檐下的一仆一孩。也没有任何人会忘记他，从法国洗衣女佣到诺顿小姐。这一点我很高兴。

除夕夜举办了化装舞会，大家玩得很开心。我本来没打算下楼，但没有衣服穿。在最后一刻，柯克太太记起来有旧锦缎衣服在，诺顿小姐借给我一些花边和羽毛。因此我打扮成错别字太太[8]，脸上戴了个面具滑入舞池。没有人认出我，因为伪装了声音，人家做梦也想不到这个文静而傲慢的马奇小姐（因为他们，他们中大多数人，认为我很呆板很冷漠，而我对于那类自以为了不起的小人就是这个态度的）居然会跳舞，会打扮自己，会突然迸出“乱七八糟的墓志铭，就像尼罗河边的寓言”这样的话。我玩得很开心，摘下面具时，大家都盯着我看，我觉得这场面太有趣了。听到一个小伙子对他的同伴说，他知道我做过演员，更有甚者，他记起了在某个小剧院看过我演戏。美格会喜欢这类笑话的。巴尔先生装扮成尼克·博顿[9]，蒂娜装扮成提泰妮娅[10]——巴尔先生怀里拥着一个完美的小仙女。看他们跳舞，用特迪的话说，是“一道很好的风景线”。

毕竟我过了一个很愉快的新年。回到房间，我陷入了沉思，尽管有许多失败，可感到自己还是有了一点长进。我现在一直都很高兴，起劲地工作，对他人比以前更有兴趣了，这一切令人满足。上帝保佑你们！

永远爱你们的乔

第三十四章　朋友


尽管乔陶醉在周围良好的人际关系中，尽管那份工作使她整日里忙忙碌碌，保证糊口的同时还由于付出劳动而让面包变得更为香甜，可她仍然挤时间搞文学创作。眼下占据她全身心的创作目的，对一个穷则思变的女孩来说十分自然，但为了达到目的而采取的手段却不是尽善尽美的。她发现金钱可以带来权力，于是，就下决心去拥有金钱和权力，不仅仅是为自用，而且为了给那些她无限热爱的人享用。

要给家里添置舒适的用品，要满足贝丝的一切需求——从冬天的草莓到她卧室里的风琴，自己要出国。永远有花不完的钱，可以尽情地施舍，这情景是乔朝思暮想的空中楼阁，已经酝酿了许多年。

写故事获奖的经历，似乎打开了一条路，只要长途跋涉和努力攀登，便可通往这令人欣喜的“西班牙城堡”。但是那部长篇小说的灾难一度挫了她的锐气，因为公众舆论是个巨人，曾经吓坏了比她更胆大的杰克[1]们，而且他们攀登的豆茎要比她的来得粗壮。和那个不朽的英雄一样，首次尝试后她休息了片刻。如果我没记错的话，那次的结果是跌了一跤，却赢得了巨人的珍宝中最最不可爱的一份。但是乔与杰克一样，“爬起来再干”的念头强烈得很，因此这一次，她从背阴的一面往上爬，获得了更多的战利品，但差一点丢失了远比钱袋更宝贵的东西。

她着手写轰动性小说了。在那个黑暗的年代，就连最优秀的国人都在读垃圾。她任何人都没告诉，编造了一个骇人听闻的故事，然后亲自带上稿件，斗胆去找《火山周报》杂志的编辑达什伍德先生。她从来没看过《裁缝重新裁》[2]，但具有女人的本能，知道服饰对许多人的影响力，要比性格的价值或者风度的魔力强大得多。所以她穿上盛装，尽力做到不激动，也不紧张，勇敢地爬上两段又暗又脏的楼梯，来到了一间混乱不堪的房子。屋里弥漫着雪茄烟的云雾，眼前坐着三位先生，他们的脚跟搁得比他们的帽子还要高。看到她出现，他们中没有一个人费神去脱帽致敬。这种接待形式让乔感到有些气馁，她在门槛上犹豫着，很尴尬地低声说道：

“劳驾，我找《火山周报》编辑部。想见达什伍德先生。”

那双翘得最高的脚跟落地了，那位烟抽得最凶的先生站了起来，手指间小心地夹着雪茄。他点点头往前走，脸上除了睡意毫无表情。不知怎么，乔觉得自己必须把这件事搞定，便拿出稿子，心慌意乱地说着事先精心准备好的话，结结巴巴，脸越说越红。

“一个朋友希望我帮着递交——一篇小说——仅仅是试笔——想聆听高见——如果合适，乐于再写。”

就在她红着脸结结巴巴说着的当儿，达什伍德先生把稿子接了过去，用两个脏兮兮的手指翻动着稿纸，挑剔的目光上下扫视着整洁的页面。

“依我看，不是第一次试笔了吧？”他注意到页码标出来了，单面誊写，没有用丝带捆扎——那是新手的明显标记。

“是的，先生。她写过一些，有一个故事在《巧言令色石旗帜》杂志上获过奖。”

“哦，是吗？”达什伍德先生迅速扫了乔一眼，这一眼似乎囊括了她身上所有的穿戴，从帽子上的蝴蝶结到靴子上的扣子，“好吧，愿意的话，可以留在这里。现在手头此类稿子太多，都不知道该怎么处理。但是我会看一遍，下礼拜给你回话。”

这会儿乔倒不想把稿子留下来了，因为达什伍德先生一点也对不上她的胃口。可是，眼下她别无选择，只能鞠躬离去。她昂着头显得很高傲，每当恼羞成怒的时候，她总是这样。此刻，她既怒又羞，很显然，根据三位男士相互会意的眼神，“我的朋友”的小编造被他们当成了大笑话。那个编辑关上门，嘴里说了句什么乔没听清，屋内立刻爆出了一阵笑声，她更加感到自己狼狈不堪。回家的路上，她几乎决心再也不来了。她拼命地缝制围裙以泄愤，一两个小时后冷静下来了，能够笑着回忆那一幕，并且渴望下礼拜的到来。

她再去的时候，只有达什伍德先生一人在，她高兴了。达什伍德先生没有上次那么一副瞌睡相，因此合乔胃口了。他也注意举止了，没有一味地抽他的雪茄，所以第二次见面比第一次要舒服得多。

“如果不反对做些修改，我们将刊用（编辑们从来不说‘我’）。故事太长了，把我做过记号的段落删掉，长度就比较合适了。”他以公事公办的口气说道。

乔几乎不认识自己的稿子了，一页页都弄得皱巴巴的，还有很多段落下面划了线。感觉就像一位慈母被要求锯断自己孩子的腿，以适应新的摇篮。她看了看标有记号的段落，发现所有道德反省的段落都被勾掉了。她感到很奇怪，这些段落都是她精心安插的，是传奇文学的压箱宝。

“可是，先生，我认为每一个故事都需有某种道德教训的，所以我有意让故事中的一些负罪人物忏悔。”

达什伍德先生收起编辑的严肃表情，露出了微笑，因为乔忘了她的“朋友”，口气俨然是个作者。

“你知道，人们要娱乐，不要说教。道德教训在当今社会是没有销路的了。”顺便提一下，他的这种说法不太对。

“那么，你认为做这些改动就成了？”

“是的，情节很新颖，构思很好——语言也不错，等等。”达什伍德先生和蔼可亲地回答说。

“你们那个——也就是，稿酬多少？”乔不知道怎么表达。

“噢，对了，那个，我们付这类东西的稿费通常是二十五到三十美元，一发表就付酬。”达什伍德先生回答说，仿佛刚才漏了这一点。据说，这类小事儿，编辑们通常都会漏的。

“很好，你们就用吧。”乔神情满意地把小说递回去，她干过报纸专栏一元一栏的工作，二十五美元也算是个好报酬了。

“我是否可以告诉朋友，如果她有更好的故事，你们愿意再刊用一篇？”乔问道，成功给她壮了胆，根本没有发觉自己刚才已经说漏了嘴。

“我们得先看看稿子。现在不能承诺。告诉她要写得简短，来点猛料，不要去在乎道德教训。你朋友喜欢在上面用什么名字？”编辑用满不在乎的口气问。

“请不要署名，她不喜欢出现自己的名字，也没有笔名。”乔说，脸不由自主地红了。

“当然可以，就按她的意思办。故事下周可以刊出，是自取稿费呢，还是给你汇过去？”达什伍德先生问，他很自然地想知道他的新撰稿人是谁。

“我来自取。再见，先生。”

她离开了，达什伍德先生把脚搁到桌上，发表了一句雅评：“老套路，贫穷而清高，但她能行。”

乔按照达什伍德先生的指示，把诺斯伯里太太当作原型，一头扎进了轰动性文学的泡沫性海洋里，多亏一个朋友扔下救生衣，她才又浮了上来，没有因为潜水而呛坏了。

像大多数年轻的写书者一样，她也把目光瞄准国外去寻找故事的人物和场景。匪徒、伯爵、吉普赛人、修女和公爵夫人都出现在她的舞台上，担任着各自的角色，真实而生动，尽可能不负众望。读者们对诸如语法、标点符号和可能性之类的小事不是很挑剔。达什伍德先生以最低价好心地让她担任他的专栏作者，并认为开门迎客的真正原因没必要告诉她——他的一个捉刀人被别人以更高的价码挖走了，卑鄙地把他晾在困境里。

不久，她就对自己的工作产生了兴趣，因为她那瘪瘪的钱包鼓起来了。随着时间一周一周地过去，明年夏天带贝丝到山区度假的小积蓄稳扎稳打地增长了。她感到满足，但有一件事让她不安，那就是没把这事告诉家里。她有一种感觉，爸爸妈妈不会赞同的。但她宁可先斩后奏，以后请求原谅。保守这个秘密是容易的，因为故事上没有署名。达什伍德先生没过多久当然发现了秘密，但承诺保持沉默，奇怪的是他居然没有食言。

她认为这样做对她没有坏处，因为她真心实意地不打算写让自己感到羞耻的东西。她一想到奉上自己所赚的钱、笑谈守口如瓶的那个幸福时刻，内疚之心就平息下来了。

但是，达什伍德先生除了令人毛骨悚然的故事，别的一律退稿，而除非去折磨读者的灵魂，不然是达不到刺激效果的。为了实现这个目的，乔不得不在历史与传奇、陆地与海洋、科学与艺术、警察局档案与疯人院里到处搜索素材。不久，她发现自己的经历很单纯，只不过略略窥见过构成社会基础的悲剧世界。从商业的角度出发，她调动特有的劲头，来弥补自己的不足。她急切地为故事寻找素材，一心要使故事情节独辟蹊径，写作手法的娴熟就顾不得了，因此她在报纸上搜寻事故、事变和犯罪案件。她打听有关毒药的书，结果引起了公共图书馆职员的怀疑。她上街观察路人的脸，研究周围人物，不管是好人、坏人，还是不好不坏的人。她钻进尘封的故纸堆里寻找真实的或虚构的故事，由于这些故事十分久远，所以和新的一样好使。她利用自己有限的机会去接触人间的荒唐、罪过和苦难。她以为自己混得很成功，却在不知不觉中开始亵渎某种女子特有的细腻品质。她生活在坏人堆里，尽管这是她虚构的社会，但对她产生了影响，因为她目前的精神和想象的食粮是危险和虚无，过早地接触生活的阴暗面，很快就让本性中抹去了天真无邪的青春气息，尽管我们每个人迟早都会经历的。

过多地描写他人的爱恨情仇，促使她研究和反思起自己的情感来，她开始感觉到，而不是看到，自己正沉浸在一种健康的年轻人不会主动介入的、病态的娱乐活动中。做了错事总会得到惩罚，乔在最需要惩罚的时候，她得到了。

不知道是对莎士比亚的研究帮助她读懂人物，还是女人渴望诚实、勇敢和坚强的天性帮助了她，当她赋予故事中的英雄以阳光下所有的完美品质时，乔发现了一个现实生活中的英雄，她对他产生了兴趣，尽管他身上还有许多常人的不完美之处。巴尔先生在他们的一次谈话中建议她，要她研究淳朴、真实、可爱的人物，不管她在哪里发现他们，并把这当成是作家的有益训练。乔听从了他的建议，冷静地转身研究起他来。他要是知道她在研究自己的话，肯定会很惊讶的，因为可敬的教授认为自己是非常微不足道的。

起初，有个问题乔始终搞不懂，为什么大家都喜欢他。他既不富有又没什么成就，不年轻也不潇洒，无论哪方面都称不上风度翩翩、仪表堂堂，更不用说才华横溢。可他却像一团温暖的火，人们为他所吸引，在他身边就像围在暖和的火炉边。他很穷，却仿佛总把东西送给别人；是个外国人，可好像每个人都是他的朋友；并不年轻，可心情开朗得像个孩子；相貌平平，还有点古怪，可在很多人眼里，他却是漂亮的，看在他的分上，人们都愿意原谅他的怪癖。乔常常观察他，试图找出他的魅力所在，最终断定是仁爱之心创造了这一奇迹。他要是有什么伤心事，也是“头埋在翅膀下”，他向世人展示的只是阳光灿烂的一面。他额头上出现道道皱纹，可时间之神似乎记得他待人善良，只是轻柔地触他了一下。他嘴边的曲线令人赏心悦目，铭记下许多友好的话语和爽朗的大笑。他那双眼睛从不冷漠，也不严厉。他那双大手温暖有力，其表现力胜过千言万语。

他穿的衣服似乎也具有主人热情好客的天性。外形很宽松，意在穿得舒服。宽大的马甲，暗示着里面有宽广的胸怀。褪色的上衣，透出几分善交际的样子。几个松垂的口袋，清楚地表明那几双小手经常空手进，满手出。那双靴子给人一种仁爱，衣服的领子也从不像别人的那样挺括，不会发出刺耳的咔咔声。

“原来如此！”乔心想。她终于发现，真诚地善待自己的同类能美化人，提升人。一位德国胖教师也不例外，尽管他大口地吃饭，自己缝补袜子，还得为巴尔这个名字所累。

乔非常珍视善良，也尊重才智，这是女性的特质嘛。对这位教授的一个小发现，使她更加敬重他。他从来不提自己，也没人知道他在家乡的城市非常受人尊敬，因为他学识渊博、诚实正直。后来一个同乡来看他，在和诺顿小姐聊天时，才透露出这件令人高兴的事。乔是从诺顿小姐那里得知的，而巴尔先生自己从来没提过，为此她更高兴了。他在美国只是个寒酸的语言教师，可在柏林他却是位尊贵的教授，乔得知此事感到十分自豪。这个发现给他的生活增添了几分浪漫的色彩，大大美化了他朴实、勤奋的生活。

除了才智，巴尔身上还有一种更加优秀的天赋，以非常意外的方式展现给了乔。诺顿小姐有出入文学圈的资格，要是没有她，乔也没有机会去见识一番。这个孤独的女士喜欢上了这位胸怀壮志的姑娘，她把许多类似的机会友善地赠与了乔和教授。一天晚上，她带着两人参加了为若干名流举办的内部聚会。

赴会时，乔准备向这些大人物鞠躬致敬。早在遥远的地方，她就已经以年轻人的热情崇拜这些人。可是，那天晚上，她对天才的敬仰受到了沉重的冲击。她发现这些大人物也不过是凡夫俗子，好久都没回过神来。她怀着仰慕的心情，羞怯地看了一眼那位诗人，他的诗句描写着餐“精神、火和露水”为生的天神，看见他正狼吞虎咽地吃着晚餐，而这种吃的热情烧红了那知性的面容，乔的沮丧可想而知。偶像落地了，她掉转方向，又有其他的发现，迅速驱散了她的罗曼蒂克错觉。那位小说大家在两个大酒杯之间举棋不定，像个钟摆有规律地摆动着；那位著名的神学家公然与一个当代的斯塔尔夫人[3]调情，而她对另一个和蔼地讽刺她的科琳[4]怒目而视，因为科琳在吸引渊博的哲学家的注意时占了她的上风；而哲学家像约翰逊一样高雅地饮着茶，显得睡意蒙眬，因为那女士喋喋不休，使得他无法说话。科学界名流们忘记了他们的软体动物和冰川时期，一边聊着艺术，一边以特有的劲头专攻牡蛎和冰淇淋；俨然是俄耳甫斯[5]第二的年轻音乐家，他曾迷倒了整个城市，却在吹牛；那个英国贵族的现场标本，恰恰是这次聚会里最普通的人。

聚会还未过半，乔就完全幻灭了。她在一个角落里坐下来，努力恢复常态。不久，巴尔先生也坐了过来，他显然与这里的环境格格不入。很快，几位哲学家大谈起了各自的业余爱好，他们踱步过来，最后在休息室掀起了一场智力竞赛。他们的谈话乔不明所以，可她喜欢听，虽然康德和黑格尔不知是哪方神仙，“主观”和“客观”也是莫明其妙的术语。这一切结束以后，“她内在意识产生的”唯一产物是头痛。她渐渐明白过来，世界正在被拆得粉碎，然后按照新原则重新组合，而这些谈话者认为，这些原则无比优越。而宗教很有可能被推理为虚无，智慧则是唯一的上帝。乔对各种哲学和玄学都是一窍不通。但是她听着听着，心里升起一种奇怪的激奋，既快乐又痛苦，感到自己飘到了时空之间，就像节日里放飞的小气球。

她回过头想看看教授的意见，发现他也在看着自己，脸上带着从未见过的严肃神情。他摇摇头，示意她走开。可她当时对思辨哲学的自由着了迷，呆呆地坐在位置上，想知道这些智者推翻了一切旧的信仰之后，拿什么作依靠。

再说，巴尔先生天性害羞，不轻易发表己见，倒不是因为拿不定主意，而是因为观点太真诚、执著，不想轻率地讲出来。他的目光从乔转到另外几个年轻人身上，他们都被璀璨的哲学焰火所吸引，他皱起眉头，渴望着说几句，他替一些血气方刚的年轻人担心，生怕他们会被焰火引入歧途，等到曲终人散才发现，只有一根空空的烟花棒，或者就是烧焦的手。

他尽量克制着，可等到有人呼吁他发言时，他义愤填膺，用雄辩的真理来捍卫宗教的尊严——雄辩使他拗口的英语变得动听起来，相貌平平的他也显得漂亮了许多。他战斗得很艰苦，因为那些智者能言善辩，而他永不言败，如铮铮汉子坚守阵地。不知怎的，听着他的讲话，乔感到世界恢复了正常。古老的信仰存在了那么长时间，显得比那些新观点要优越。上帝不是盲目的力量，永恒也不是美丽的寓言，而是一个福音事实。她感到脚又踏实落地了。虽然巴尔先生讲不过别人，但信仰绝没有动摇，等他讲完，乔想鼓掌感谢他。

她没有这么做，不过她记住了这一幕，从心底里尊敬教授。她明白，要在此时此地直抒胸臆，确实要费很大的劲，是良知让他不能保持沉默。她开始意识到，拥有品德比金钱、地位、才智和美貌都更可贵；她开始感到，要是伟大像一位智者说的那样是：“真理、尊严和善意”，那么她的朋友弗里德里希·巴尔不仅善良，而且伟大。

这一信念日益巩固。她重视他的看法，她希望得到他的尊敬，她要使自己配得上他的友谊。就在她的这个愿望最诚挚的时候，她几乎失去了一切。事情起源于一顶三角帽，有一天傍晚教授来给乔上课，头上戴了顶纸做的士兵帽，是蒂娜给戴的，而他忘了拿下来。

“很显然他下楼前不照镜子，”乔心里想着，面带微笑。只见他说了声：“晚上好！”便严肃地坐下，要给她朗读《华伦斯坦之死》，完全没意识到他的主题与他的头饰是个滑稽的反差。

起先她什么也没说。她喜欢听他开怀大笑，当有趣的事情发生时他总是这么笑，所以她不去提它，而让他自己去发现。不久她把这事完全忘记了，听德国人读席勒的作品很有吸引力。阅读之后便是功课，这节课上得很活泼，乔那晚的心情很好，那三角帽让她的眼睛快活地闪烁着。教授不知道她是什么原因，终于忍不住了，他停下来问她，略带奇怪的神情，令人无法抗拒：

“马希[6]小姐，你当着老师的面笑什么？你不尊重我，今天表现这么不好？”

“你忘了把帽子拿下，我怎么尊重得起来呢，先生？”乔说。

这位漫不经心的教授严肃地把手举到头上，碰到了那顶小三角帽，他拿下来盯着看了一会儿，然后把头一仰，笑了起来，笑声像是从大提琴发出来的，很欢快。

“啊！我看到了，是那个小淘气鬼蒂娜干的，她让我成了个傻瓜。哦，这没什么，但你得注意，要是这堂课你学得不好，你也要戴帽子。”

但是这堂课停了好几分钟，因为巴尔先生看到帽子上的画，把它打开来，非常厌恶地说：“我希望这类报纸不要进这幢房子。孩子们看了不合适，年轻人也不宜读。这种东西很不好，我不能容忍制造这些危害的人。”

乔朝那张纸看了一眼，看到了一幅可爱的插图，上面画着一个疯子、一具尸体、一个恶棍和一条毒蛇。她不喜欢它，但内心有一股冲动促使她去把报纸翻过来看，这冲动不是不高兴而是害怕，因为这一刻她想到报纸可能是《火山周报》。然而它不是，她的恐慌平息了，她还记得，即使是那报纸，上面有她的小说，也不会有她的署名，她不会暴露。可是她的眼神和脸红出卖了自己，虽然教授是个漫不经心的人，可是他看到的要比人们想象的多得多。他知道乔在写东西，也曾不止一次在报社碰到她。她从来不提起，所以他也没问，尽管他很想看看她的作品。现在他意识到了，她正在做她自己羞于承认的事情，这让他很不安。他不像许多人那样对自己说：“这不关我的事。我无权说三道四。”他只记得她是个贫穷的小姑娘，远离父母的关爱，便产生了帮扶的冲动，这冲动来得既迅速又自然，就像要伸手从污水坑里救一个婴儿。所有这些念头在他的脑子里闪过，但脸上没显露一丝痕迹。报纸翻过去了，乔在穿针引线，他相当自然但又很严肃地开口说：

“对，你做得很对，不去看这些东西。我认为好女孩是不应该看这些的。这些东西是用来取悦一些人的，但我宁可让我的外甥玩火药，也不会给他们看这些害人的垃圾。”

“并不是所有这类东西都是害人的，只是无聊，你也知道。如果有需求，我觉得供应这些东西没什么坏处。许多非常体面的人就写这所谓的轰动性小说，这是正当的谋生手段。”乔说着用针猛地划皱褶，针过之处留下一道小裂痕。

“威士忌有需求，但我想你我都不喜欢去销售它。如果体面的人知道自己都做了什么样的伤害，就不会觉得这种谋生手段是正当的。他们没有权力在小糖球里包毒药，然后给小孩子吃。不，他们应该想一想，在做这种事之前先清扫大街上的泥巴。”

巴尔先生热切地说着，把报纸揉成一团，朝炉子走去。乔静静地坐着，仿佛火已烧到她的身上。那三角帽变成了烟，毫无害处地沿着烟囱离去了。可她的脸还在燃烧，而且还烧了好一会儿。

“我真想把所有剩下的都付之一炬。”教授嘴里咕哝着，带着宽慰的神情走回来。

乔想象着，她楼上那堆报纸烧起来，火焰会有多大啊，此刻她那辛辛苦苦赚来的钱沉重地压在她的良心上。然后，她自我安慰地想：“我的跟那些不一样，只是无聊，绝对不会害人，所以用不着烦恼。”她拿起书本，一副勤学的神情问：“我们还要继续上课吗，先生？我现在很乖，很有礼貌了。”

“希望如此。”他就说了这么几个字，但其含义比她想象的要多，他严肃而慈祥的目光让她有一种感觉，仿佛“火山周报”这几个大号字体就印在她额头上。

一回到自己的房间，她就拿出报纸，细细地重读了一遍自己所写的每一个故事。巴尔先生有点近视，有时要戴眼镜。乔曾经试戴过一次，笑着发现她书上细小的字放大了。此刻，她似乎戴上了教授的精神眼镜，或者说道德眼镜，而荒唐故事中的瑕疵令人恐惧地盯着她，让她惊慌失措。

“确实是垃圾，如果继续写下去，过不了多久，情况会更加糟糕，因为一篇比一篇耸人听闻。我这么盲目地写着，损人不利己，仅仅是为了钱。我知道是这么回事，只要我静下心来读，就会感到非常羞愧。要是家里人看到了，或者巴尔先生掌握了，我该怎么办？”

单单这么想着，乔的脸又发烫了，她把整捆报纸都塞进了火炉里，火焰之大差点要把烟囱烧着了。

“是的，火炉是这些易燃垃圾的最好归宿。我宁可把整幢房子烧掉，也不愿意叫人家用我的火药来炸飞他们自己。”她一边想，一边看着《侏罗纪的魔鬼》迅速燃烧，化成一堆带一只只火热的眼睛的黑色灰烬。

三个月的辛劳只留下一堆灰烬和搁在腿上的钱了。乔坐在地上，冷静地思考怎么来处置这笔工资。

“我认为，还没造成太多的伤害，我可以保留这笔钱，支付我的工时费。”乔自言自语地说。经过长时间的沉思后，她不耐烦地补充道：“我简直希望自己没有良心，这要方便得多。如果我不讲究做好事，那么，做了错事就不会感到不安，我就会活得很好。有时候真希望妈妈爸爸对这种事情不那么苛求。”

哦，乔，千万不能这么想，而应该感谢上帝，爸爸妈妈确实有点苛求，而且从内心深处可怜那些没有这样的监护人的人吧。监护人用原则来管束，对不耐烦的年轻人来说，这可能看起来像是监狱的高墙，但结果证明是妇人塑造性格的可靠基础。

乔不再写轰动性小说了，她认定金钱补偿不了她所承受的情感震撼。但是，她走向了另一个极端，这是她那一类人通常的做法。她走上了舍伍德[7]太太、埃奇沃思[8]小姐和汉娜·莫尔[9]的道路，然后写了一篇故事，与其说是小说，不如说是随笔，或者说是布道词更为恰当，因为它是激情洋溢的道德篇。她从一开始就心存疑虑，她活跃的想象力和女孩子特有的浪漫情感，对这种新的风格感到不自在，就像穿着上世纪呆板而累赘的服装参加化装舞会。她把这篇说教的宝贝送给好几个市场，结果却发现没有买主，于是，她倾向于同意达什伍德先生的观点——道德说教没有销路。

然后，她开始试着写起儿童故事来，如果不是那么唯利是图，想要得到几个臭钱的话，这个故事是很容易脱手的。唯一愿意给她付足稿酬，使她感到少儿文学值得一试的人，是位可敬的先生。这位先生觉得，让全世界皈依他那种信仰是自己的使命。但是，虽然乔很愿意为儿童写作，但她不情愿让自己笔下所有的淘气男孩，因为不去某个主日学校上学而落入熊口，或者被疯牛顶撞；也不情愿让笔下所有去上学的好孩子得到各种各样的福佑，从金色的姜饼到他们离开今世时的护送天使，口齿不清的舌头喃喃着圣歌或者布道词。所以，少儿文学的尝试没有结果，面对现实的乔把墨水瓶盖上，突然变得非常谦虚起来了，是一种健康的谦虚：

“我什么也不懂。得等待开窍以后再重新开始。这期间，如果我不能做得更好，就清扫大街上的泥巴，至少，那是正当的。”这个决定证明，第二次从豆茎上掉下来，对她来说是有益的。

当这些内心革命进行着的时候，她的外表生活和往常一样忙碌，波澜不惊。如果说，有时候她显得严肃或者有点儿悲伤的话，那么，其他人都不会察觉，只有巴尔教授注意到了。他默默地关注着，看她有没有接受他的责备，并从中受益。对此，乔根本没发觉他在注意她，她经受住了考验，他满意了。尽管他们之间从不谈起，他知道她已放弃了写作。他的这种猜测不只是凭她右手的食指不再沾着墨水了，而且还有现在晚上的时间她下楼来了，也不再在报社里碰见她了，学习起来也有顽强的毅力了。所有这些现象让他断定，她现在全身心地在从事一些有益的事情，哪怕不是很对她的胃口。

他多方面帮助她，成了她的一位挚友。乔感到非常幸福，尽管墨水笔搁起来了，但她还学了德语以外的课程，为谱写自己人生的轰动性故事打下基础。

这是一个漫长而怡人的冬天。到六月，她离开了柯克太太家。分别的时刻，大家都依依不舍。几个孩子极为伤心，巴尔先生的满头毛发都倒竖起来，心情烦躁不安的时候，他总把头发弄得乱七八糟。

“准备回家？啊，你有家可回，真幸福。”当她告诉他回家的事时，他回答说，然后默默地坐在一个角落里，抚弄着胡子，这是离别前夜在她举行的小告别会上的一幕。

她一早就要动身，所以提前跟大家一一道别。轮到该跟他说话时，她热情地说：“喂，先生，如果旅行路过我们那里，别忘了来看我们，好吗？如果你忘记，我肯定不会饶恕你的。我要他们都来认识我的朋友。”

“是吗？我可以来？”他一边问，一边低下头看着她，脸上是一种渴望的表情，她没看出来的。

“是的，下个月来。劳里下个月毕业，你来参加毕业典礼，换个新口味。”

“你是说你那个最要好的朋友？”他的语气有点变了。

“是的，我的男孩特迪。我很为他骄傲，想让你见见他。”

乔抬起了头，神情自若，只沉浸在快乐的憧憬中——介绍他们认识的情景。巴尔先生脸上的某种东西突然让她想起，她看待劳里可能超越了一个最要好的朋友。正是因为特别不希望表现出有什么异样，脸却不知不觉地红起来了，她越是努力克制，脸越是红。要不是蒂娜坐在她的膝上，她真不知道自己该怎么渡过难关。幸好这个小孩要拥抱她，于是她立刻顺势把脸藏起来，希望教授没看见。但他看见了，他的心情又起了变化，从瞬间的焦虑变成了平常的神情，他诚恳地说：

“恐怕没时间参加毕业典礼，但我希望这个朋友非常成功，希望你们大家幸福。上帝保佑你们！”他说着与乔热烈地握握手，把蒂娜驮到肩上，离开了。

但是，等两个男孩上了床之后，他长时间地坐在壁炉前，脸上的表情显得很倦怠，心情很是沉重，还有点德国人的思乡病。有一次，他回忆起乔抱着那个小孩坐着时脸上曾经露出一种从没见过的温柔表情，于是双手托着头坐了一会儿，然后站起来在房间里踱步，好像在寻找不见了的东西。

“那不是我的，现在不可有这种奢望。”他自言自语，近乎呻吟地叹息着。然后，仿佛在责备自己没有控制住这种渴望，他走过去，亲吻枕头上两个头发蓬乱的脑门，拿起他很少用的海泡石烟斗，翻开了他的柏拉图。

他已尽了最大的努力，也处理得很有男子气概。可是谁都明白，他不会觉得两个调皮男孩，一个烟斗，抑或那本神圣的柏拉图，能够替代老婆孩子。

第二天早上，天虽然还很早，可他还是赶到车站来为乔送行。也多亏了他，乔在愉快的回忆中开始了寂寞的旅途。一张熟悉的笑脸为她送行，一束紫罗兰陪着她，最美好的是，她幸福地想着：“好了，冬天过去了，书没写，财也没发。可我交了个朋友，值得结识，我要一生都与他为友。”

第三十五章　心痛


无论劳里有何种动机，那一年，反正他的学习突飞猛进，毕业时成绩斐然，拉丁语演说，竟然跟菲利普斯[1]那样悠扬流畅，像狄摩斯梯尼[2]那样滔滔不绝，这都是他朋友的说法。他们都在现场亲眼目睹，他的爷爷——啊，真感到自豪！——当然，还有马奇夫妇，约翰、美格夫妇，以及乔和贝丝。他们都为他欢呼雀跃，感到由衷的钦佩。当时，男孩子一般对此殊荣都不屑一顾，然而日后要在世上获得这样功成名就却是做不到了。

“我只能留下吃那顿短命的晚宴，明天一大早会赶回家。姑娘们，你们会像以往那样接我吗？”劳里一边问，一边把小姑娘一个接一个搀扶进车厢。一天的欢庆已经结束了。他喊着“姑娘们”，心里指的却是乔，唯一遵循老规矩的姑娘。对于她那人品好、事业成功的男孩，她一向有求必应，所以态度热情地回答：

“特迪，我会来的，风雨无阻，在前面开路，单簧口琴吹《向凯旋英雄欢呼》。”

劳里看了她一眼以表谢意。她心里为之一阵惊恐不安。“唉，天哪！我知道他要开口了，我该怎么办呢？”

经过夜间的思考和上午的工作，乔心里的恐慌减轻了，并且断定自己不会虚荣透顶，认为别人会向她求婚。她已经给了他们充分的理由，可以了解她的回答会是什么。于是，她按照预定的时间出发了，希望特迪不会轻举妄动，让她去伤害他那脆弱的情感。她在美格家坐了一会儿，呷了几杯清香提神的戴茜和戴米饮料之后，进一步增强了与特迪面对面交谈的底气。但是，她看见远处模糊的健壮身影后，却巴不得转身就逃了。

“乔，单簧口琴在哪里？”劳里走近对方能听见的范围，就嚷道。

“忘记带了。”乔又鼓足了勇气。这样打招呼，就称不上情人见面了。

以往，乔在这种场合总是挽着他的胳膊，这次却没有。但劳里并没有抱怨，这可是一个不好的征兆。当时，劳里一个劲地谈论天南地北的风情逸事，从大道走进了小路。那条小路穿过一片树丛，通往家里。此刻，他走得越来越慢，后来，突然不再谈笑风生了，并且不时出现难堪的停顿。眼看不断陷入沉默的陷阱，乔为了救场，急切地说道：“这下，你必须好好来一个长假了！”

“有此打算。”

劳里语气坚定，乔不由迅速抬头看了看他，发现他正低头看着自己，那表情让她确信，可怕的时候来了。她伸出手，恳求道：“不，特迪，别这样！”

“就要这样，你得听我说。否则，是无济于事的。乔，我们的事必须挑明了，越快越好，这样对双方都好。”他说话时，面色涨红，情绪激动。

“那么，就说说你的打算吧。我洗耳恭听。”乔被逼无奈，所以只有豁出去了。

劳里是个青涩的情郎，但他情真意切，确实想把事情挑明，哪怕要他的命。所以，他还是那样急躁地单刀直入，但嗓音时不时地哽咽起来，尽管作为男子汉，他也想努力把话说得顺畅：

“我对你可是一见倾心，一往情深啊，乔。我情不自禁的，你对我一直那么铁。我曾想表白，但你不让我说。现在，我要说给你听，请给我一个答复，我实在不能再这样下去了。”

“我是想让你省省别说了。我以为你理解——”乔开口道，不禁觉得事情的难度远远超乎自己所料。

“我知道是这样。但是，姑娘们的心都难以捉摸，永远搞不清她们的意思。说不行，往往意味着可以，把男人折腾得魂飞魄散，从中取乐。”劳里以不可否认的事实作为防御工事，振振有词地说道。

“我可不是这样，从来不想让你爱上我。我总是尽量走开，让你不去想它。”

“我也这样认为。你就是这么一个人，这是无济于事的。我反而爱你爱得更深了，我努力学习是为了讨好你。我不打台球了，凡是你不喜欢的，我都放弃。耐心等待，从不埋怨。因为，我希望你是爱我的，尽管我离优秀还差得远——”说到这儿，他情不自禁地哽咽了。他折断了几根毛茛枝条，清了清短命的嗓子。

“不，你很优秀的。对我来说真是太优秀了，我感激不尽，为你而感到自豪，真的喜欢你。我无法想象，为什么不能如你所愿地爱你。我努力过，但无法改变自己的感情。如果我口是心非，那可就是骗人了。”“乔，真的吗？千真万确？”

劳里顿住，握着她的双手，问话时的神情，乔是不会立刻忘记的。

“是真的，千真万确，乖乖。”

此时此刻，他俩走在树丛里，已经靠近跨篱笆的台阶。乔说得慢吞吞的，刚说完，劳里便丢下她的手，转过身想继续往前走，但是，毕生第一次篱笆变得无法逾越了。于是，他将头靠在长了苔藓的栏柱上，僵立着，可把乔给吓坏了。

“哦，特迪，对不起，真的对不起。假如事情能够挽回，我宁可以死相搏的！希望你不会这么想不开，我实在没办法啊。你知道，要强迫自己爱一个不爱的人是办不到的。”乔尽管心里悔恨，却生硬地诉说着，一边轻轻地拍了拍他的肩膀，回想起当年他是这么安慰自己的。

“有时候是可以强迫的呀。”栏柱边传来沉闷的嗓音。

“我认为这种爱情是不对的，我宁可不去尝试。”回答是斩钉截铁的。

一阵长时间的沉默。河边的柳树上传来一阵乌鸫欢快的叫声，高高的青草在风中发出刷刷的声响。后来，乔坐在篱笆的台阶上，严肃地说：“劳里，我想告诉你一件事。”

他一怔，似乎中了一枪，将头一扬，声嘶力竭地喊道：“别跟我说那个，乔，现在我受不了！”

“说什么呢？”乔问道，对他的怒吼感到迷惑不解。

“说你爱那个老头。”

“什么老头？”乔问道，心想他一定是在指他的祖父。

“那个恶魔似的教授，你写信总爱提到他。如果你说爱他，我肯定会铤而走险的。”劳里说话时，紧握拳头，眼露凶光，似乎说话算数的。

乔真想笑，但忍住了。她也很激动，暴躁地说：“特迪，不要骂人！他既不老，也不坏，是一位好人，是我最好的一位朋友，但仅次于你啊。恳求你别发脾气了，我想友善一点，但是，我知道，如果你骂我的教授，我会发怒的。爱他或爱其他什么人，我根本没有想到过啊。”

“但是，你以后会的，那我会落得怎么下场呢？”

“你也会爱上别人的，也做个明智的男孩，忘记这些烦恼。”

“我无法爱上别人，永远不会忘记你，乔。永远都不会的！”他一边说，一边跺了跺脚，加强语气的激昂。

“我该拿他怎么办呢？”乔叹息道，觉得情感这样东西比想象的要难以驾驭，“你还没有听我想告诉你的话呢。坐下来听我讲，我确实想说清楚，让你开心。”她解释道，希望能够凭理智来宽慰他，但这恰恰证明她一点儿都不懂爱情。

劳里从最后那句话中听出了一线希望，便在她脚边的草地上坐下，将胳膊靠在篱笆底部的台阶上。他抬起头，满怀期望地望着她。这种姿势，对于乔来说，想说一些平静的话，想保持头脑清醒，就很不方便了。因为男朋友在深情地望着自己，目光充满了渴望的神情，况且，由于她铁石心肠，他的睫毛仍然带着泪珠的湿润，这样，她怎么能够开口绝情呢？她轻柔地转过他的头，抚摸着那一头为她而留的波浪式头发——哎，多么感人哪！——说道：

“我同意妈妈的看法，你我并不般配，因为，我俩爱发脾气，个性很强，这大概会搞得很惨的，假如我俩愚蠢透顶，去——”说到这最后一句话，乔停顿了一会儿。但是，劳里接过话，欣喜若狂地说了出来。

“结婚——不，不会那样惨的！如果你爱我，我会成为一位完美无缺的圣徒，因为，你能随心所欲地塑造我的。”

“不，我做不到。我做过努力，但未成功。我不想通过这么严肃的尝试，拿我俩的幸福冒险。我俩意见不合，而且永远都不合，所以，我俩终生都是好朋友，但我们不会草率行事的。”

“会的，如果有机会，我们会的。”劳里不服气地咕哝道。

“请你理智一点，考虑情况理性些。”乔恳求说，几乎理屈词穷了。

“我不会理智的，也不会吃你‘理性考虑’这一套，这对我没有用，只能使你变得更加狠心。我认为你没心没肺的。”

“但愿如此！”

这时，乔的嗓音有一点颤抖。劳里认为是一个好征兆，便转过身，竭尽全力，以空前耸人听闻的谄媚口吻劝道：“乖乖，可别让我们失望啊！大家都在期盼这件事。爷爷早已把它挂在心上了。你家的人都喜欢，我可离不开你呀。你就同意了吧，让我们幸福起来吧。快呀，来吧！”

乔是在几个月之后才懂得，她拥有坚强的毅力，才坚持住己见，决意断定自己并不爱她的男孩，而且永远都无法爱。做出这种抉择是很艰难的，可是她做到了。她明白，拖延下去是没有用的，而且也是残酷的。

“我不能发自内心地说‘同意’，所以根本不会说的。你慢慢会明白，我是对的，以后，你会为此而感谢我的——”乔神情肃穆地说。

“如果谢你，那我该死！”劳里从草地上蹦了起来，一听就感到气愤极了。

“不对，你会的！”乔一口咬定地说，“过一阵，你会缓过劲来的，然后，去找一位才貌双全的姑娘，她会爱慕你的，在你豪宅中成为称职的主妇。但是，我做不到。我相貌平平，动作笨，脾气怪，年龄大，你会为我而感到羞愧的。于是，我俩就会吵架——你看，甚至现在都忍不住了。我可不喜欢上流社会，但是，你喜欢。你会讨厌我写东西，可我不写就活不下去。这样，我俩会得不到幸福的，接着，就悔不当初，最后，一切都会遭殃了！”

“还有呢？”劳里问道，感到难以耐心地倾听这种预言式的滔滔评议。

“说完了，但我认为自己永远都不会嫁人。我独自一人很快活，我太喜欢这种自由，不会匆匆忙忙地为了一位凡人而将其抛弃。”

“不敢苟同！”劳里插话，“你现在这样想，但是，总有一天，会喜欢上某人，然后，你深深地爱上他，生死相托的。我知道，你会这样做的。这是你的德行，旁观者清，我倒要拭目以待。”这位气急败坏的情郎将帽子往地上一扔，那个手势如果不是他那张悲剧面孔，倒会有喜剧效果。

“是啊，我会生死相托的，假如他出现，让我不得不爱上他，你得好自为之啊！”乔大声地说道，对可怜的特迪不耐烦了，“我已经倾注了全力，可是你并不理智，还一个劲地逗我，强求于我，真是太自私了。作为朋友，我会一直喜欢你，真的好喜欢。但是，我绝不会嫁给你。你明白得越早，我俩就越好过——就这样！”

这话就像火药点了火，脱口而出。劳里望了望乔，一时不知如何是好。后来，他猛然转身，声嘶力竭地喊道：“乔，你总有一天会后悔的。”

“唉，你去哪儿呀？”乔大声地问道。他的脸色吓了她一跳。

“去见鬼！”他的回答真是令人欣慰。

乔听了不禁一怔。劳里冲下河岸，朝着河边飞快地走去。可让年轻人就这样去寻短见横死，需要极度的愚蠢、痛苦或者罪孽。劳里可不是那种软弱无能的人，一次失败就被打倒。他并不想夸张地纵身跳进河里，而是鬼使神差地将衣帽扔进船，奋力划船，划得比比赛时都要快。乔深深地吸了一口气，松开握紧的双手，望着可怜的小伙子力图摆脱心中的苦恼。

“这样对他有好处。回家后，他会温柔平和，悔悟一番的，届时我可不敢见他了。”乔说。在缓步回家的路上，觉得自己仿佛谋杀了一个无辜者，然后埋尸荒草下，就补充说：“现在，我得去见劳伦斯先生，请他好好对待我的这位可怜朋友。我希望他是爱贝丝的，或许到时候会的，但是，我开始觉得自己错怪了她。哎呀呀！女孩子怎么能够又去找情郎，又将其拒绝呢？我看真是太糟糕了。”

乔坚信，这件事谁都干得没有她漂亮。于是，她直接去见劳伦斯先生，坚强地讲述了那段难以启齿的故事，说完之后，便崩溃了，哭得很凄惨，埋怨自己太过分，不讲情面。结果，尽管劳伦斯这位好心的老先生听了之后很失望，但没有说一句指责的话。他觉得不可思议的是，居然有女孩可以不爱上劳里的，所以希望乔回心转意。但是，他比乔更加明白，爱是不能强勉的。这时，他悲伤地摇了摇头，决心帮孙子脱险。因为，劳里年轻气盛，跟乔分手时说的那些话，对他产生的震动很大，尽管他不肯承认。

劳里回到家之后，筋疲力尽，但神智镇静。爷爷迎接他，装作一点儿都不知情，而且装得很成功，长达一两个小时之久。后来，他俩一起坐在暮色中，这一直是令他俩心旷神怡的时刻。但是，这一次，老人家却觉得难以跟以往一样天南地北地侃侃而谈了，而小伙子更难以听进那些表扬他去年成功的话。对于他来说，那些成功现在仿佛是莎士比亚演绎过的爱的徒劳。他耐住性子，听了一会儿，便走到钢琴旁边弹奏起来。屋子的窗户开着，恰巧乔和贝丝在花园里散步。这一下，乔听到琴声，感悟就比妹妹都深刻了。劳里是在弹奏贝多芬的《悲怆奏鸣曲》，而且弹得比以往都动听。

“可以说，弹得真是太好听了，可是太伤心了，让人听了就想落泪。小伙子，弹一曲欢快的吧。”劳伦斯先生说道。他那颗善良的心充满了同情，很想表示表示。但是，一下子却不知从何做起。

劳里迅速弹起了欢快的曲调，节奏猛烈，达数分钟。本来他可以鼓足勇气弹完的，这时，短暂的间歇里却传来了马奇太太的喊声：“乔，乖乖，进来吧。我需要你。”

这正是劳里的心里话，当然，含义不同罢了！听到这句话之后，他弹得走了调，琴声戛然止住，而琴师则默默地坐在黑暗中。

“我忍受不下去了。”爷爷喃喃低语。他站起身，摸索着走向钢琴，友善地将双手搭在劳里厚实的肩膀上，用慈母般的口气说道：“孩子，我都明白了。”

沉寂了片刻，劳里突然问道：“谁告诉你的？”

“是乔自己。”

“那，都结束了！”劳里不耐烦地抖落了爷爷的手。他尽管对爷爷的同情很是感激，但是，男子汉的自尊心使得他难以承受男人的怜悯。

“不见得。我有一句话要说，说完之后，一切就结束了。”劳伦斯先生以非同寻常的和蔼口吻答道，“或许，你现在不想待在家里吧？”

“我不打算逃避一个女孩。乔不能不让我见到她，我就住在这儿，爱住多久，就住多久。”劳里以挑衅的口气插话。

“假如你是我眼里的那种绅士，就不要这样。我也很失望，但是对那姑娘已经无能为力了。现在，你唯一能够做的事情，就是出门一阵子。你想去哪儿？”

“任何一个地方。我不在乎自己下场如何。”劳里站了起来，满不在乎地放声大笑，十分刺耳，爷爷听了发憷。

“处理这件事，要像个男子汉。看在上帝的分上，切不可鲁莽。何不按计划出国，忘了它呢？”

“我不能。”

“但是，你一直痴痴地想往外跑。我答应过你，读完大学让你出国。”

“啊，并没有打算独自一人出国的！”劳里一边说，一边快步走进房间。说话时的那种表情，幸亏爷爷没有看见。

“不是叫你一个人走。有人乐意跟你一块儿出国，浪迹天涯海角。”

“是谁，老爷？”他停下来倾听。

“是我呀。”

劳里立即转身回过来，伸出手，嗓音嘶哑地说：“我真是个自私的野蛮人，可是——你知道——爷爷——”

“上帝保佑！是的，我是知道的。以前我经历过这一切的，一次是我还年轻时，后来是和你父亲的事情。哎，乖孩子，给我安静地坐着，听听我的安排。一切已经准备就绪，立刻就能执行。”劳伦斯先生解释道。他一直握着劳里的手，似乎生怕他像父亲当年那样，挣脱后逃之夭夭。

“好吧，老爷，什么安排呀？”劳里无动于衷地坐下，他的表情和声音都表明他不感兴趣。

“伦敦有生意需要照看。我原来的意思是让你去处理，当然，我去解决会更好。这儿的事情由布鲁克管着，会顺顺利利的。我的合伙人几乎包揽了一切。我只是坚持到你来接班，任何时候都可以交班的。”

“可是，你并不喜欢旅行，老爷。你这把年纪了，我可不能强求啊。”劳里说道。对于爷爷的自我牺牲精神，他很感激，但是，要走的话，他宁可独自去。

老先生早已看透了他的心思，便想方设法加以劝阻。劳里的情绪使他明白，让孙子自行其是是很不明智的。于是，他明知出门之后不如家里舒服，却按下了遗憾的情绪，口气坚决地说道：“嗨哟哟，好孙孙，我还没有老掉牙嘛。我对于这个计划很满意，这对身体会有好处的，我这把老骨头是不会累坏的，现在外出旅行，就像坐在家里的椅子上一样轻松自在啊。”

这时，劳里坐在椅子上不安地挪动着身子。这表明，他的椅子并不舒服，或者说，他可不喜欢旅行安排。这不禁使老人赶快补充说：“我不想瞎掺和，也不想成为累赘。我一起外出，是因为我认为，我若留在家，你反而不愉快。我并不打算与你一块闲逛，而是让你爱去哪儿，就去哪儿，我会自得其乐的。我在伦敦、巴黎都有朋友，想去探望他们。期间，你可以去意大利、德国、瑞士，随便你选择，去欣赏绘画，聆听音乐，欣赏风景，体验冒险的行程，玩个够。”

先前，劳里觉得心都完全碎了，外面的世界如一片荒野。但听了爷爷最后那句巧妙的话语，他那颗破碎的心不禁为之震颤，原先头脑中那片陌生而荒芜的世界，骤然展现出几块绿洲来。他叹了一口气，然后淡漠地说道：“老爷，随意啦。我去哪儿，去干啥，都无所谓。”

“可是，孩子，请记住，我有所谓的呀。我给你完全的行动自由，拜托你能够诚实地加以利用。劳里，答应我，这些你都能做到。”

“老爷，随你。”

“很好。”老先生想道，“你现在不在乎，但日后那个许诺可以使你免得淘气，否则，算我看错人。”

劳伦斯先生是一个精力充沛的人，所以，他趁热打铁，不等垂头丧气的小子缓过气来就反扑，他们出发了。后来，准备行装的时候，劳里的举止又恢复到失恋年轻人的常态，喜怒无常，一会儿脾气暴躁，一会儿忧郁寡言，而且，食不甘味，衣着散乱，把大部分时间都花在钢琴上，净弹奏一些节奏猛烈的曲调。他在躲避乔，但却又通过窗户凝视着她，这样，心里感到宽慰一点。夜间，劳里那悲怆面容使乔梦魂萦绕。白天，则使她深感内疚。劳里跟一般的痴情人不同。他从不提起自己失恋，也不愿意让别人，甚至不让马奇太太安抚自己，或者表示同情。为此，他的朋友们知情后，倒觉得一阵轻松，只是劳里出发前的几周令人十分难熬。所以，听说可爱的可怜家伙要出门去忘却忧愁，再欢乐回家时，大家都很开心的。当然，对于他们的误解，劳里仅仅狡黠地笑了笑。他就像一个态度清高、内心酸楚的徇情者，对于爱情坚贞不屈。

动身出发时，劳里装出一副兴高采烈的样子，故意掩饰内心忐忑不安的情绪，但似乎老是露馅。别人并不理会他的轻松神态，但表面上装作深受鼓舞给他看。他表现得挺不错，直到马奇太太亲吻他。马奇太太在他耳边嘀咕，充满了慈母般的关切。后来，劳里知道马上就要上路了，便匆忙和大家拥抱，包括伤心的汉娜。接着，他拼命地跑下了楼。乔跟在他身后，要是他转过身，就朝他挥手。他果然转身回来了，伸出双手去搂抱上一格台阶上面的她，仰望着她，那脸色使他的短暂恳求既信誓旦旦，又哀婉动人。

“唉，乔，你就不能？”

“特迪，乖乖，但愿能够做到！”

除了短暂的停顿之外，送别就这样过去了。当时，劳里挺了挺身子，对大家说道：“好了，别在意。”他二话没说，转身就走了。啊，其实并不好呀，乔确实在牵肠挂肚。因为，她狠心回绝后，他的鬈发脑袋一度靠在她胳膊上。她心里觉得，好像用刀刺杀了心爱的朋友。当劳里头都不回地离开她时，她明白，男孩劳里永远不会回来了。

第三十六章　贝丝的秘密


那年春天乔到回家时，她对贝丝身上发生的变化感到吃惊。没有人提到这种变化，似乎也没有人觉察到。变化是逐步逐步地出现的，每天碰到的人，并不感到惊诧。当然，对于离开一段时间而擦亮眼睛的人来讲，变化是一目了然的。乔见到妹妹的面容，内心感到很沉重。苍白的面色跟去年秋天差不多，但消瘦多了，不过，脸上带有一种奇特的透明神色，似乎凡人因素已经缓缓提炼掉了，而脆弱的肉身透出不朽的亮丽，带着一种不可名状的凄凉的美。乔看在眼里，感同身受，但当时一言未发。不久，她的初步印象便失去了大部分力度。贝丝似乎很愉快，似乎没有人表示怀疑她身体好多了。当时，乔正陷于其他的烦恼，一时便忘记了自己的担忧。

劳里走了之后，一切又都平静了。乔感到隐隐的焦虑回归了，并缠绕着她。她吐露了自己的罪孽，大家宽恕了她。但是，后来她向妹妹展示自己的积蓄，并且提议去山地旅行时，贝丝向她表示深深谢意之后，却恳求不要离开家那么远。妹妹觉得，再去一趟海边小住更加适合自己。由于无法劝动外婆丢下婴儿，乔便把贝丝带到了那个安静的地方，在那里，贝丝可以大量呼吸野外的空气，让海边新鲜的微风吹红她那苍白的面庞。

这地方不算时髦，但是，即使和一些愉快的人在一起，姐妹俩也很少交朋友。她们喜欢相依为命。贝丝很害羞，不敢接触外界，而乔一心想着贝丝，也顾不上关心别人了。所以，她们姐妹俩待在小天地里，独来独往，根本没有意识到，自己已经引起周围人的兴趣。外人以同情的目光观察着这对强姐弱妹，她们总是互不相离，似乎已经本能地感到，彼此永别已经为时不远了。

她俩确实都感觉到了，但谁都没有说出口。在我们与至爱亲朋之间，往往存在着一种难以打破的隔阂，所以，乔觉得贝丝和她的心之间，拉上了一层面纱。每当她伸手去拉开时，似乎宁静的气氛中有着某种神圣的东西，让乔等待贝丝先开口。乔感到迷惑不解，也觉得很庆幸，因为父母亲好像并没有发现她所看见的那些事情。那几周过得十分清静，她心中的阴影越来越清楚，但她没有对家里人提起，认为等到贝丝回到家之后，身体状况毫无起色时，一切都会不言自明。乔越发纳闷，妹妹是否已经猜测到严酷的真相，当贝丝长时间躺在温暖的岩石上，头靠着她的腿部，任凭有益健康的海风吹拂着，聆听脚边浪花歌唱时，脑子里都在想些啥呢？

有一天，贝丝向她袒露了。当时，乔以为她睡着了，因为，她一动不动地躺着。她把书放在一边，若有所思地望着妹妹，试图从苍白的脸颊上看到希望的征兆。但她并没有看到令人满意的结果。贝丝的面颊仍然很消瘦，双手无力，仿佛连采集的玫瑰色小贝壳都捧不住。乔越发痛苦起来，知道贝丝在缓缓离她而去。于是，她就本能地抱紧了自己最值钱的宝贝。乔一时觉得目光模糊，看不清东西。后来，当她看清时，只见贝丝温柔地仰望她，仿佛根本没有必要地说：“亲爱的乔，你都知道了，我很高兴。我曾经想告诉你，但说不出口。”

她不回答，也无泪，两个人脸贴着脸。伤心时，乔从来都不哭。当时，她比贝丝更虚弱，妹妹试图安慰她，勉励她——双臂拥抱着她，轻声地在她耳边说着宽心的话。

“乖乖，我早已明白了。现在，我已经习以为常了。考虑这件事，加以忍受，其实并不难。你尽可以这样来考虑，别为我难过，因为，这是最好的解脱了，千真万确。”

“贝丝，你在秋天这么闷闷不乐，就是为了这件事吗？难道你那时就已知道并一直一个人承受到今天吗？”乔问道。可是她不愿意知道或者说出这就是最好的解脱。然而，乔很高兴得知，劳里与贝丝的麻烦无关。

“是的，当时我放弃了一切希望，但不愿意去承认它。我尽量去认为，那是一种病态的痴想，所以，不想让它去扰乱别人。不过，当我看见你们大家都精神焕发，身体强健，又有那么多幸福的打算时，不免觉得，难道我就不能像你们那样生活吗？那时，我的心情很惨的，乔。”

“唉，贝丝，你却没有告诉我，没让我安慰你，没让我帮助你呀！怎么能拒我于局外，独自一人忍受呢？”

乔的嗓音充满了温柔的责怪口气。一想到贝丝孤独的挣扎，她就心痛不已。贝丝学会向健康、爱情和生命告别，快乐地背起十字架的过程中，一定是在孤军奋战啊。

“也许，这都是错的，但我尽力好自为之。我心里也没有数，没有人说过这些事。我希望自己搞错了。怎么能用这事去吓唬你们大家，那样做就自私了。当时，母亲在操心美格，艾美不在家，你跟劳里在一起那么愉快——至少，我当时是这样认为的。”

“我那时认为你是爱他的，贝丝。我离开，是因为无法爱他。”乔把心里话一吐为快。

贝丝对于乔的想法实在太惊讶了，弄得乔不顾贝丝的苦楚笑了笑，轻轻地往下说：“那么，你不爱他，乖乖？我担心真有这么回事啊，心想那时候，你那颗脆弱的心一直在为情所困呢。”

“嘿，乔，他那么爱你，我怎么会呢？”贝丝像天真的孩子似的反问道，“我确实很爱他。他对我那么好，我怎么能不爱呢？但是，他除了当姐夫之外，又能成为什么人？我真希望有一天，他真的成为那种人。”

“不会通过我联姻的。”乔口气坚定地说，“艾美是留给他的。他俩很般配。但是，我现在对于这种事没有心思。贝丝，除了你，别人会怎么样，我并不在乎。你可得好好康复啊。”

“哎，我实在想康复的！我在尝试，可是每天都会失去一些，而且日益确信，失去的再也回不来了。就像大海的潮水，乔，一旦退潮，虽然缓慢，但是无法阻拦。”

“必须阻拦，你的潮水不能这么早就退，十九岁还太年轻呀。贝丝，我不能让你走。我要苦干，为你祈祷，为你抗争。无论如何，我都要保住你。一定有办法的，还来得及。上帝不会残忍得将你我分离。”可怜的乔大声反抗道，她的精神状态远远不如贝丝那么温顺而虔诚了。

心地单纯而真诚的人很少会奢谈虔诚，他们不会夸夸其谈，而是将其体现于行动。这样做所产生的影响力强于信誓旦旦的说教、表白。贝丝无法论证，也无法解释是什么信念给了她勇气和耐心去放弃生命，笑迎死亡。她就像一个袒露心扉的孩子，什么问题都不问，便将一切都交给了上帝和大自然，给了我们大家的父母亲。她确信，他们，只有他们才能够教诲人，加强人的心灵，振作人的精神去面对现世和来世。她没有用圣人的大话去责怪乔，而是为乔的满腔热情而更加热爱乔了，更加密切地拥抱可贵的人类亲情。天父从不规定我们要戒掉它，反而通过它吸引我们亲近天父。贝丝不能说：“我乐意离开。”因为，生命对于她还是甜蜜的。她紧紧抓住乔，只能抽泣着说：“我尽可能做到愿意离开。”此刻，这巨大苦恼的第一波苦涩潮水向她俩袭来。

后来，贝丝的思绪渐渐地恢复了宁静。她问道：“回家之后，你会告诉他们吗？”

“我想不说他们也会知道的。”乔叹息道。她觉得，贝丝每天都有变化。

“或许不会吧。听说，凡是深爱的人，对于这种事情都是熟视无睹的。他们如果觉察不出，你就替我告诉吧。我不需要保留任何秘密，让他们先有思想准备更友善。美格有约翰和孩子去安慰她。你必须坚决留在父母身边，好吗，乔？”

“我尽力而为。可是，贝丝，我还没有放弃呢。我开始认为，那正是病态的痴想，不想让你信以为真。”乔尽量欢快地说道。

贝丝躺着沉思了一会儿。接着，她安静地说：“不知道该怎样表达自己，除了你，我不想对任何人讲。因为，我只能对你倾吐肺腑之言。我只想说，自己觉得命中并没有打算要我长寿。我跟你们其他人不一样，从来没有制订长大后该做哪些事的计划，也从来没有向你们一样考虑过结婚。我除了认为自己是一个愚笨的小贝丝，只会在家奔跑，到哪儿都没有用之外，真难以想象自己会成就什么事。我从来都没有想过外出，现在棘手的是要离开大家。我不害怕，但是，我似乎觉得，即便上了天堂都会想家的。”

乔一时不知道该说什么好。只有海风呼呼，海潮拍岸。几分钟过去了，一只白翅膀的海鸥展翅飞过，银灰色的胸脯反射出一道太阳的光辉。贝丝目送着海鸥在天空消失，眼里充满了悲伤的神情。这时候，有一只灰毛的小沙鸥在海滩上轻盈地跳跃，顾自轻声唧唧，似乎在欣赏天上的太阳和地上的大海。有时候，那只鸟飞得离贝丝很近，用友好的目光望着她，然后，停落在温暖的岩石上，梳理身上湿润的羽毛，显得相当自在。贝丝笑了，感到一阵安慰，因为，这只小生灵似乎在向她示好，提醒她，世界是美好的，仍然值得自己去欣赏。

“可爱的小鸟！乔，你看，多么驯服啊。海鸥和唧唧沙鸥相比，我更喜欢沙鸥。虽然野性不足，样子一般，但看上去很愉快，是贴心的小家伙。我去年夏天度假称其为我的小鸟。妈妈说，这些小鸟往往使她想到我——一刻都不停，素色羽毛，总爱靠近海边，哼着自得其乐的曲子。乔，你是一只海鸥，健壮狂野，喜爱暴风雨，时常飞往大海深处，独自开心。美格则是一只斑鸠。而艾美像一只她所描绘的云雀，总想飞入云霄，但总是落进自己的巢穴。真是可爱的小妹妹啊！那么有抱负，但心地善良温柔，无论飞得多高，绝不会忘记家园。希望能再次见到她，可是她似乎又飞得那么遥远。”

“她春天会回来的。我是说，你要准备好，再次见到她，欣赏她。到那时候，我会把你调养得身轻体健，容光焕发。”乔说道。她觉得，贝丝身上发生的所有变化中，说话的变化最大，因为，现在说话似乎并不费力。妹妹在自言自语，已经根本不像过去那个害羞的贝丝。

“亲爱的乔，不要再希望了。那样徒劳无益，我敢肯定。我们不要再凄凄惨惨，而要享受亲情，在一起等待。我们会有欢快时光的，因为，我现在并不难受。如果你帮助我，我想退潮会顺利的。”

乔弯下腰亲吻那张宁静的脸庞。随着那安静的吻，她将自己的身心都献给了贝丝。

她想得对。她们回家时，无须说什么话。父母祈祷免于看见的东西，早已昭然若揭。贝丝经过短途旅行，已经筋疲力尽，回到家便上床了。她说能够回到家真是比什么都好。后来，乔走下楼，发现已经不用再吃苦费力去叙述贝丝的秘密了。她进屋时，只见父亲的头靠着壁炉台，一动不动，而母亲伸出双臂，似乎在求救。乔一句话未说，走向前给予她无声的安慰。





第三十七章　新印象


下午三点，在英格兰大道漫步，法国尼斯的整个时尚界一览无余——那是个迷人的地方，宽阔的步道边种植着棕榈树，四处都是鲜花和热带灌木，一边靠海，另一边则是和宽阔的汽车道相通，路边上是一幢幢风格各异的饭店和别墅，再后面有背靠山坡的橘园。这条大道反映了各国的风土人情、语言和服饰。天气晴朗时，到处都是欢声笑语，就跟狂欢节一样热闹。这里有举止高傲的英国人、谈吐生动的法国人和态度刻板的德国人。当然，还能碰到潇洒的西班牙人、丑陋的俄国人、温顺的犹太人以及不拘礼节的美国人。他们有的坐马车，有的席地而坐，有的在悠闲地散步，或谈论新闻，或批评最近抵达尼斯的社会名流——不管是里斯托里[1]，还是狄更斯；是维克托·伊曼纽尔[2]，还是桑威奇群岛[3]王后。五花八门的车队丝毫不逊色于来自四面八方的游客，也吸引了大批人注目，尤其是那些低矮的敞篷四轮四座马车，太太和小姐们自驾马车，驱赶着一双大劲头的矮种马。马车上都蒙着漂亮的轻薄网罩，以免荷叶状的裙边飘出狭窄的车厢。车厢后面都站立着年轻的马夫。

圣诞节，沿着这条步道，有一位个子高大的小伙子在背着手散步。他表情淡然，看上去像意大利人，但一身的穿着却像英国人，无拘无束的举止则像美国人——这种混杂特征吸引了无数女子爱慕的回眸，还引起了各种纨绔子弟不停地耸肩，继而羡慕起那个男子的身材。他们身穿黑色的丝绒西装，打着玫瑰色的领结，带着浅黄色的牛皮手套，西服的扣孔边还插着黄色的香橙花朵。人群中有不少值得羡慕的漂亮脸庞，但是，小伙子并不理会，仅仅有时候瞥一眼那些蓝色衣服的金发女郎。后来，他离开了步道，在十字路口踯躅了一下。他似乎犹豫不决，不知是该去聆听公园里的乐队演奏，还是该沿着海滩闲逛，去城堡山看看。这时，他听到急促的马蹄声，便抬头张望，只见一辆精巧的马车载着一位小姐快速驶过大街。那是一位穿蓝色衣服的金发小姐。他朝她凝视了一会儿，神情不禁为之一振，连忙像孩子似的挥舞着帽子，连奔带跑地去迎接她。

“啊，劳里，真的是你吗？我以为你永远不会来了！”艾美一边大声喊道，一边放下缰绳，伸出双手。旁边一位法国妈妈很反感，急忙拉着女儿跑开，生怕孩子见到这位举止随便的“英国疯子”后，跟着伤风败俗。

“我路上耽搁了，但我说过会陪你过圣诞节的，所以，我来这儿了。”

“你爷爷好吗？什么时候到的？住在哪里？”

“很好——昨晚——住肖旺饭店。我去过你们住的饭店，但你们出去了。”

“我有很多话要说，但不知从何说起！上车随便谈吧。我赶马车兜风呢，正急着找做伴的。弗洛在为今晚养精蓄锐呢。”

“什么活动呀，有舞会吗？”

“我们饭店有一场圣诞晚会。那儿有许多美国人，是他们为了庆祝圣诞而举办的。你一定会跟我们去吧？婶婶一定会着迷的。”

“谢谢。现在去哪儿逛？”劳里问道。他身子往后一靠，抱住胳膊休息。这个动作正合艾美的心意。她喜欢赶马车，阳伞、马鞭和白马背上蓝色的缰绳让她感到无比满足。

“我打算先去银行取信，然后去逛城堡山。那儿景色美丽，我要去喂孔雀。你去过那儿吗？”

“前几年经常去，去看看吧，我并不介意。”

“那么，好好说说你的情况吧。我上一次听说你的事，是你爷爷在信中说他在等你从柏林回来。”

“是的，在那儿住了一个月，然后去巴黎见了爷爷。他住在那儿过冬。他在当地有许多朋友，开心的事情多，所以，我去了之后，又出来了。我俩相处得好极了。”

“那是适合社交的安排。”艾美说道。他发现劳里的举止少了什么，不过，不明白是什么。

“嘿，你看，他讨厌旅行，而我讨厌不动，所以，两人都自便，没有麻烦。我经常陪着他。他喜欢听我的冒险故事，我喜欢从外地漫游回来之后，有人欢迎我。肮脏的旧窝，不是吗？”他一脸恶心地说道。他们驱车沿着林荫大道，向旧城的拿破仑广场驶去。

“尘土美如画，我并不介意。山河秀丽嘛。其实，能看上几眼狭窄的马路纵横交错，我最乐意了。现在，我们得等待这支队伍走过去，他们是去圣约翰教堂的。”

劳里在无精打采地观看那些华盖底下行进的牧师，还有头蒙白色面罩、手持细长燃烛的修女，以及一些低声吟唱的蓝衣教友。艾美在望着劳里，一种新的羞涩感偷偷袭上心来，觉得他跟以前不一样了。身边的这个男人看上去情绪低沉，已经找不到当初那个满脸挂着喜悦的男孩了。她心想，他比以前帅多了，气质也大为提高，可这时，碰到她时内心涌现的喜悦红晕消退了。她定眼看了劳里一眼，发现他疲惫不堪，精神欠佳——但不是病态，也不是不高兴，而是比一两年前老成持重了，过往的优裕生活反而使他显得暮气沉沉了。艾美无法理解，但不敢冒昧问他。她摇摇头，用鞭子抽了一下马。这时，那支队伍蜿蜒地走过帕格里奥尼大桥的拱门，消失在教堂里。

“Que pensez-vous?[4]”艾美亮出法语问道。自从出国之后，她的法语句子说得比以前数量多了，但质量并没有提高。

“小姐光阴没有虚度，成绩斐然啊。”劳里答道。他用手贴在胸前，面带仰慕地欠身。

艾美兴奋得脸红了，但这句恭维话却并没有使她感到满意，还不如以前在家里时，劳里说几句心直口快的赞扬话。那时候，劳里会在节日里围着她漫步，笑容可掬，拍拍她的头，说上一句她“真让人感到快活”之类的话。她不喜欢劳里现在说话的口气，不是听腻了，而是听上去言不由衷，尽管他的表情颇为生动。

“如果他长大后会变成这样，我真希望他永远是个孩子呢。”艾美心想。她的内心有一种很失望，很难受的奇怪感受，但同时却试图装作轻松快活。

艾美在阿维格多银行找到了那封珍贵的家信后，便把缰绳递给劳里，如饥似渴地读了起来。马车正在沿着光线暗淡的林荫道徐徐行进。路边绿篱的香水月季花像在六月那样绽放。

“母亲说，贝丝身体很差。常常想应该回家去看看，但他们都让我待着。所以就没走，这种机会永远都不会碰到了。”艾美一边说，一边严肃地看着一页信纸。

“这件事，我想你是对的。你在家里什么都干不了。他们知道你现在一切都很好，快乐又充实，就感到莫大宽慰了，乖乖。”

劳里往前挪了挪身子。说过那句话，他看上去更像以往的模样了。压在艾美心头的担心顿时减轻了，劳里的表情，刚才的举止，以及兄长般的一句“乖乖”，似乎让她放下心，即使出现了麻烦事，在异国他乡，她也不会孤单一人。想到这儿，她笑了起来，给劳里看一张乔身穿起稿工作服的速写小像。只见乔的帽子上耸立着一个蝴蝶结，嘴里吐出一句话：“灵感在燃烧！”

劳里笑了，接过速写像，放进背心口袋，以免被风吹掉，然后，饶有兴趣地听艾美读那封精彩的信。

艾美说：“对我而言，是一个跟往年一样的快乐圣诞节。早晨收到礼物，下午碰到你，收到信，晚上出席晚会。”这时，他俩下车登上了古要塞的废墟，身边跟着一群华丽的孔雀，都在温顺地等待喂食。艾美站在一堵残墙上方，位置比劳里高。她一边放声大笑，一边将面包屑撒向羽毛光亮的孔雀。劳里跟她刚才看自己一样端详着她，难免要好奇地观察时间和离别在她身上带来的变化。他找不到感到困惑失望的东西，却有不少可以钦佩赞许的地方。艾美除了姿态谈吐稍稍做作之外，仍然是那么生机勃勃，风度翩翩，衣着和神态还增添了一丝难以形容的气质，就叫它典雅吧。她一贯比正常年龄成熟，如今在言谈举止上又赢得了某种稳重的气度，简直像一位过于老于世故的少妇，但她过去就有的娇气却时常露头，固执的性格依然如故，国外的历练也没有糟蹋她天生具有的坦荡个性。

劳里在观看艾美给孔雀喂食时，并没有发觉以上所有情况。但他所看见的一切已经使他很感兴趣，觉得心满意足了。他已经在心中留下了一张可爱的相片：里面站在阳光下的是一位神采飞扬的大姑娘，阳光把她的衣服照出了柔和色彩，把她的脸颊照得清新动人，把她的头发照得一片金黄。她在宜人的景色中，显得楚楚动人。

他俩爬到山顶的岩石平台上之后，艾美向劳里挥手，似乎在欢迎他来到自己的老窝。她一边往山下比划，一边喊道：“还记得那个大教堂和彩车吗？还记得海湾里拉网捕鱼的渔民吗？就在下面，有通往弗兰卡别墅、舒伯特塔楼的那条可爱道路，最美的是海上的那个小点，听说是科西嘉岛，这些你都记得吗？”

“记得，变化不大呀。”劳里毫无热情地回答。

“乔要是能看到那个著名的小黑点，她肯定会忘乎所以的。”她兴致勃勃，很想看见劳里也和她一样情绪高涨。

“是啊。”劳里说完了。但他转过了身，瞪大眼凝视着科西嘉岛，一位比拿破仑[5]野心还大的篡位者使他对它产生了兴趣。

“替乔好好看一眼，然后过来给我讲讲这一段时间你自己都经历了些什么。”艾美说完，就地坐下，准备好好谈一谈。

但是，她并没有如愿。尽管他来到她身边，爽快地有问必答，可她只听到他在欧洲大陆游逛，还去过希腊。他俩打发了一个小时，便驱车回家了。劳里向卡罗尔太太问候之后，便告辞了，答应晚上再来。

一定要替艾美记一笔，夜里，她特意扮靓了一番。时光和分离使这两个年轻人都发生了很大的变化。艾美对老朋友刮目相看，不再把他看做“我们的男孩”，而看做英俊合意的男人了。她意识到自己有一种十分自然的渴望，要获得他的青睐。她完全了解自己的长处，而且能够品味高尚、技巧娴熟地加以充分利用。这可是贫穷而美貌的女子的财富啊。

尼斯的塔勒坦布和绢网薄纱价格很便宜。所以，艾美在这种场合便用这两种面料包装自己。她效仿明智的英国时尚，大姑娘着装简朴，用鲜花、小饰件和各种花哨的小玩意儿，把自己装饰得惹人注目，化妆既不昂贵，又有效果。必须承认，有时候妇女的本性会受制于艺术家的品味，而痴迷于花里胡哨的东西，一会儿是古董发型，一会儿是塑像般姿态，一会儿又是古典式服饰。但是，亲爱的人们，我们都有些许偏爱，年轻人的这些不足之处是情有可原的。她们以自己的美貌替我们养眼，用自己的朴素打扮使我们心情快乐。

“我确实想让他觉得我漂亮，而且，回家去告诉他们。”艾美自言自语道。她穿上了弗洛白色的旧丝绸舞裙，外面罩了轻如云烟的崭新“错觉”薄纱，白皙的双肩和一头金色秀发喷薄而出，产生了无与伦比的艺术效应。她将自己的一头卷曲的波浪式头发扎成赫柏式发束披在脑后，其余未加处理，很有见地。

“这发式现在不时髦，但很美观，我可经不起惊世骇俗的打扮。”过去，每当建议艾美按照最时髦的样式去留鬈发、吹风，或者梳辫子时，她都会这么回答。

在这种重要的场合艾美没有高档的饰物来装饰，于是，她便在羊毛裙上系上玫瑰红的杜鹃花环，还在洁白的双肩上挂了细嫩的绿色藤蔓。她还记得当年给靴子涂彩的情形，便审视了一眼白色缎面便鞋，那个满意劲儿，就跟小姑娘一样。接着，她在房间里跑滑步，独自欣赏那双贵族打扮的脚。

“鲜花刚好配我新买的扇子，手套很合手，婶婶给我的法国手帕有真丝花边，给整套裙子增添了气派。要是有古典式的美丽鼻子和嘴巴，那我该多么开心啊。”她一手拿着一根蜡烛，挑剔地审视自己。

尽管有此先天不足，艾美移步离开房间时，看上去却异乎寻常地高兴，走起路来十分潇洒飘逸。她平时很少奔跑——她认为，这跟她的风度不配。她的个子较高，不宜活泼奔放，只有典雅庄重才合适，就像朱诺天后[6]一般雍容华贵。她在狭长的客厅里来回踱步，等待劳里进来。一开始，她伫立在枝型吊灯下，灯光照耀下的头发效果极佳。接着，她又改变了主意，走到了客厅的另一头，似乎为急于把第一印象做好的小姑娘愿望觉得不好意思。偏巧，她做得不能再好了，因为，劳里悄悄地进了客厅，她竟然没有看到。她站在远处的窗户旁边，头转向一边，手提着裙子，背靠红色的窗帘，看上去就像一尊白色的雕像，摆放效果非常好。

“戴安娜[7]，晚上好！”劳里说。他的目光停留到艾美的身上时，露出她很高兴看到的满意神色。

“晚上好，阿波罗[8]! ”艾美看着他，笑脸应答。劳里看上去也格外débonnair[9]。艾美想到自己能手挽这么一位风度翩翩的男子汉步入舞厅，不禁从心底为戴维斯家相貌一般的四位小姐感到可惜。

“给你鲜花。是我亲自插的，记得你不喜欢汉娜称之为‘短花丛’的那种。”劳里说话时，递给她一束香喷喷的鲜花。那花束托架正是她当初每天路过卡迪利亚花店，看到摆放在橱窗里，久久心仪的那种。

“你真好！”她感动地喊道，“如果知道你会来，我今天一定会给你准备一点东西，虽然比不上这个漂亮。”

“谢谢。这花没你说的那么漂亮，你戴上才好看的。”劳里又说道，只见艾美一甩手腕戴上了银镯。

“可别这样说了。”

“我想你喜欢听这种话儿。”

“但不是听你讲呀，听上去不自然嘛，还是喜欢你过去的直言不讳。”

“我真高兴你能这样想。”劳里回答时，一副欣慰的神态。接着，他替艾美扣紧了手套，还问自己的领带是否打直了，举止就跟他在家里他们结伴去参加晚会时一模一样。

那天晚上，聚集在长餐厅的客人五花八门，只有欧洲大陆才能见到。好客的美国人把他们在尼斯认识的每一个人都请来参加舞会，他们对爵位没有偏见，为了给圣诞舞会增光添彩，所以特邀了几位贵族。

有一位俄国王子屈尊在客厅的角落里坐了一个小时，跟一个胖妇人交谈。那个妇人身穿黑色的丝绒，脖子上戴珍珠扣链，打扮得就像哈姆雷特的母亲。一位十八岁的波兰伯爵跟妇人们打得火热。她们都叫他“可爱小伙子”。一位德国尊贵殿下之流则专门为进晚餐而来，他四处闲逛，寻找好吃的。罗斯查尔德男爵的私人秘书，是大鼻子犹太人，脚蹬一双利索的靴子，此时此刻，他满脸堆笑，似乎主人的大名给他带上了金色的光环。有一个自称认识皇帝的法国胖子在纵情地跳着，过足了舞瘾。英国的德·琼斯夫人给场面平添趣味，她从小家庭拖来了八个孩子。当然，舞会上有许多步履轻松、嗓门尖利的美国姑娘，还有不少相貌端庄、表情木然的英国姑娘。可是，法国小姐虽然不漂亮，却相当泼辣。同时有常见的远游小绅士，都在尽情地玩耍。不同国籍的母亲们则坐在墙边，笑盈盈地观看他们跟自己的女儿跳舞。

那晚艾美靠在劳里的胳膊上亮相时，年轻姑娘谁都能猜出她当时的心情。她知道自己漂亮。其实，她酷爱跳舞，觉得自己的脚生来就适合在舞厅里跳舞。当时，艾美那种沁人心脾的感觉感油然而生，那是年轻姑娘第一次发现了可爱的新天地呀，她们注定要凭青春美貌和女人的天性在此叱咤风云的。她打心底里怜悯戴维斯家的女儿们，她们笨手笨脚，长得又不好看，没人愿意去陪伴，除了表情严肃的老爸，或者三位满脸凶相仍待字闺中的姑姑。她走过她们身边时，十分友好地朝她们鞠躬。这样做得好，可以让她们有机会看一眼她的裙子，而且会极其好奇地打听，她仪表堂堂的朋友会是谁呢？乐队刚开始演奏，艾美便喜形于色，双眸炯炯发光，双脚不耐烦地敲打着地板。她擅长跳舞，很想让劳里知道。不久，劳里口气十分平静地问她：“你愿意跳舞吗？”这时，她内心的震动有多么巨大，是只可意会不可言传的啊。

“舞会上总得跳舞嘛。”

看见艾美惊诧的面色，听到她的抢白，劳里立即纠错。

“我是说第一支舞，给我面子吗？”

“如果让那位伯爵等上一等，可以和你跳一次的。他的舞跳得棒极了，但他会谅解的，你可是老朋友嘛。”艾美说道。她希望提到那个人的名字会有作用，可以向劳里表明，她是不能小觑的。

不过，艾美仅得到了这些满足：

“是个棒小子，波兰人可惜矮了点，无法支撑‘诸神的女儿，亭亭玉立，美艳超凡’[10]。”

他俩的周围是一批英国人。在法国四对舞中，艾美不得不循规蹈矩，始终觉得自己连塔兰台拉舞[11]都能尽兴地跳一场。劳里把她留给那位“可爱小伙子”之后，自己便去找弗洛献殷勤了。他并没有向艾美预定后面的乐事，这种缺乏远见的做法要不得，后来受到了应有的惩罚。艾美随之一口气跳到吃晚饭，那时候是打算宽恕劳里的，只要他能稍示忏悔就行了。但他慢悠悠地走过去，并没有奔跑，想请她跳下一场，欢乐的波儿卡雷多瓦舞，这时，艾美佯装正经，愉快地递给他一本跳舞预约本。艾美并没有在意劳里礼貌的道歉。不一会儿，她就和那个伯爵跑开去跳舞了。她看见劳里坐在她婶婶旁边，脸上一副安然的神情。

这是不可原谅的。艾美很长时间都没有再去注意劳里，除了跳舞间歇，她走到陪媪那儿补充必要的别针，或者稍微休息一下时，偶尔给劳里打几个招呼。艾美生气具有明显作用，虽然一肚子气都藏在笑脸后面，笑起来显得格外爽朗快乐。劳里愉悦地望着她，艾美跳得不快不慢，富有活力，非常优雅，这正是休闲取乐的应有之义。劳里十分自然地开始以这种新的角度打量艾美。尚未入夜，劳里就断定：“小艾美长大了，一定会亭亭玉立，楚楚动人。”

舞会十分热闹，不久，在场的人都被社交情绪笼罩住了。参加圣诞节的娱乐活动，大家都面带喜气，心情舒畅。乐师们有的拉琴，有的吹号，有的弹奏，似乎都陶醉了。会跳舞的，都在尽情地欢跳，不会跳的，则对于跳舞的邻座眼热非常。戴维斯一家脸色阴沉，琼斯像一群小长颈鹿似的嬉闹。突然，那位金色光环的秘书像流星似的穿过舞厅，领着一位神采飞扬的法国妇人飞奔，地板上拖曳着她那粉红色的绸缎裙裾。那位尊贵的条顿人找到了餐桌旁，喜不自胜，接二连三地吃遍了菜单上的美味。看到他风卷残云地糟蹋食物，garçons[12]瞠目结舌。那位皇亲国戚却大出风头，他什么舞都跳，不管会不会。每当舞步跳不好时，就即兴地以芭蕾舞的脚尖旋转动作应付。胖墩墩的家伙像孩子似的忘乎所以，看上去很有趣，因为，尽管他“有分量”，但跳舞时就像橡皮球蹦蹦跳跳的。他一会儿小步奔跑，一会儿快速滑步，有时候，还扬腿跳跃。他跳得满面红光，光秃的头顶油光闪亮，燕尾服的后摆在飘荡，轻舞鞋真的在空中闪亮。当舞曲终止后，他擦了擦额头上的汗珠，像不戴眼镜的法国式匹克威克似的朝大家粲然一笑。

艾美和她的波兰舞伴也跳得非常出色，同样热情洋溢，但在优雅和灵巧方面更胜一筹。劳里不由自主地随着舞曲的节奏望着那双白色的舞鞋上下跳跃，它们似乎长了翅膀，不知疲倦。终于，小弗拉基米尔松开握着艾美的手，一边忙不迭地宣称自己“该早退了，不胜惶恐”。艾美则打算休息了，想去看看她那位变节骑士是怎样接受惩罚的。

惩罚很成功。二十三岁的人沉浸在友好的圈子里，失恋便得到了慰藉，沉浸于美貌、灯光、音乐和舞蹈的销魂因素之中，年轻的神经激荡起来，热血沸腾，青春蓬勃，精神高涨。劳里起身为艾美让位子，看上去似乎振作起来了。他又匆忙去为她取晚餐，艾美脸上带着满意的微笑，自言自语地说：“啊，我看这样对他有好处！”

“你看上去就像巴尔扎克笔下的‘Femme peinte par elle-même[13]'。”劳里说，一只手为艾美扇风，另一只手为她拿着一杯咖啡。

“我的口红不会脱落的。”艾美用手擦了擦容光焕发的面颊，干练地向劳里亮出白色的手套。劳里见了哈哈大笑。

“这面料，你叫什么呀？”劳里碰了碰她飘到他膝上的裙褶子。

“‘错觉’薄纱。”

“好名字。很好看——新产品，不是吗？”

“不，老掉牙了。你见过许多姑娘穿它，直到今天才发现很好看——stupide[14]! ”

“我从来没看见你穿过，所以才说错了，是不是啊？”

“别说了，住嘴。现在宁可喝咖啡，也不听恭维话。喂，不要晃来晃去的，见了就紧张。”

劳里正襟危坐，温顺地接过空盘子，听任“小艾美”差使自己，心里感到一阵无名的喜悦，因为，艾美已经不害羞了。她有难以遏制的欲望去践踏他了，其实，男人们露出任何臣服的迹象时，姑娘们都有让人开心的践踏办法。

“你是从哪里学会这种东西的？”劳里脸上带着疑问的神色问道。

“‘这种东西’可是一种非常模糊的说法。请问你能解释吗？”艾美回道。她其实是明白他的意思的，但故意捉弄他，让他解释无法说清的难题。

“嗯——风度啦，气派啦，泰然自若啦，还有——还有——‘错觉’薄纱——你知道的。”劳里说到这儿，不禁笑了。他话说了一半，就用那个新词解脱了自己的困境。

艾美满足了，当然没有流露出来。她假正经地答道：“国外生活会不由自主地改造人的，我边玩边学习的，至于这个嘛——”她朝裙子做了一个手势——“呃，绢网纱不值钱，花束是白拿的，而我习惯于废物利用。”

艾美后悔刚才最后说的一句话，担心趣味不高尚，但劳里反而更喜欢她了，觉得自己很赞赏她耐心抓住机会的勇气，也尊重她巧用鲜花遮盖贫穷的乐天精神。艾美不知道为什么劳里那么友善地望着自己，也不知道为什么他把自己的签名写满了她的跳舞预约本，欢欣鼓舞地把晚上其余的时间都倾注在她身上。然而，导致上述可喜情感变化的冲动，却来自双方彼此无意识中赋予对方的一个崭新的印象。

第三十八章　束之高阁


在法国，年轻的姑娘们日子过得很无聊，所以一旦结了婚，“自由万岁”才成为座右铭。在美国，众所周知，姑娘们很早就签署了独立宣言，怀着共和党人的热情去享受自己的自由。但年轻的少妇通常跟着太子出世就放弃了王位，然后，就像进了法国的修道院一样，过着幽居生活，当然，其实还谈不上清静。不管她们愿意与否，结婚的喜庆气氛一过去，她们实际上便被束之高阁了。不过，她们当中大部分人不以为然，就像前几天一位美貌妇人所宣称的：“我现在依然漂亮，可嫁了人，就没有人理睬我了。”

美格没有长得那么超凡出众，打扮也不入时，所以，直到孩子们一周岁时，才经历这种精神折磨。因为，在她的生活小天地里，民风淳朴，她觉得比以往更受钦佩和爱戴。

她是一位真正的小妇人，天生的母爱意识在她身上尤其强烈。她成天都在一心一意地为孩子们操心，两耳不闻窗外事，两眼不瞧他人颜。无论白天，还是夜晚，她都无微不至地照顾孩子，可谓牵肠挂肚，兢兢业业，忘记了疲累。所以，她听任保姆去摆布约翰，这位爱尔兰妇女现在是厨房部主事了。约翰是恋家的男人，已经习惯了妻子的关爱，如今绝对想念这种照顾，但是，他对孩子非常宠爱，一度十分乐意地放弃自己的舒适，糊涂地认为不久一切都会恢复宁静的。然而，三个月过去了，安宁并没有复得。因为，美格看上去很憔悴，神情不安，那两个孩子每时每刻都在缠着她，耗费她的时间。这样一来，不少家务活就耽搁了。再说，厨师基蒂干活总是随随便便，结果，约翰经常食不果腹。早晨，约翰出门时，那位身陷家务活的老婆就爱给他派一些小差使，让他感到很迷惑。夜晚，每当他开心地回到家，渴望搂抱一下老婆孩子时，总是碰钉子。“嘘，他们烦人一整天啦，刚刚睡着啊。”如果他想在家开心地娱乐一下，则会听见这句话：“不行，会吵醒孩子的。”如果他暗示去听讲座，或者听音乐会，看到的总是一张责怪的面孔，然后，听到一句斩钉截铁的话：“想扔下孩子去寻欢作乐，办不到！”孩子的夜哭经常把约翰从睡梦中惊醒。有时候，他会在深更半夜，迷糊地看见一个静悄悄地来回走动的怪影。每当楼上的鸟巢发出轻微的唧唧喳喳叫声，操持家政的家伙便会说跑就跑出去，扔下他不闻不问，所以，饭菜吃了一半就丢下了。晚上，他看报时，戴米的肚子痛进入了船期消息，戴茜跌跤会影响股票价格，因为，布鲁克太太只关心家庭新闻。

可怜的约翰活得很不舒坦，因为，孩子夺走了他的妻子，家庭仅仅是一个托儿所。每当他走进孩儿国的神圣领地，不绝于耳的“嘘嘘声”便使他觉得自己简直成了破门而入的蛮横外人。半年来，他都十分耐心地逆来顺受。可是，并没有出现任何修正的迹象。于是，他便像其他父亲流浪者那样——企图去外面寻找一点点安逸。斯科特结婚了，就在不远处安了家，于是，夜晚，当自家的客厅空无一人时，约翰经常跑过去玩一两个小时，妻子唱起摇篮曲来，可真是没完没了。而斯科特太太则长得可爱动人，家务不多，脾气温顺，是一位贤妻良母。她家的客厅总是窗明几净，棋盘随时都可以拿来下棋，钢琴调音很准。另外，客人们总是谈天说地，海阔天空，心旷神怡，而且，她家的晚餐精美，诱人胃口。

如果不是感到在家孤独难忍，约翰一定会守着自家的火炉，可惜，他谢天谢地地退而求其次了，邻居家成了他赏心悦目的地方。

起初，美格倒很赞成丈夫新近的串门活动，得知约翰在那儿能够愉快地打发时间，她十分宽慰，否则，他不是在自家的客厅打盹儿，就是步履沉重地在屋里踱步，把孩子吵醒。斗转星移，出牙期的操心事后来都过去了，宠儿们都会按时去睡觉了，妈妈的休闲时间多了，便开始惦念起约翰。她觉得，如果没有约翰穿着旧晨衣，在她对面坐镇，靠着火炉的围栏安逸地烘烤他那双便鞋，自己一个人陪伴针线筐就太乏味了。她不会开口要求约翰待在家里，但不告诉他，他也就不知道老婆需要他，所以她感到受伤，而她已经彻底忘记，有过无数个夜晚，他曾经徒劳地等待自己。美格由于整日牵挂家庭，心事重重，这时，已经变得神惶心疲了。再好的家庭主妇每当承受到家务事的压力，也会心境扭曲，不讲理。另外，这些人身体缺乏锻炼，整天郁郁寡欢。她们过度崇拜那个美国妇女的偶像，就爱围着茶壶转，一个个难免觉得自己不太精神，没力气。

“是啊，我又老又丑，约翰对我早已不感兴趣了，所以，他会抛下人老珠黄的妻子，去见那位无子女拖累的靓邻居。”美格经常盯着镜子说道，“不过，孩子们喜欢我。他们可不在乎我身体瘦弱，脸色苍白，没工夫烫发的呢。他们是我的慰藉，约翰迟早会明白我欣然为他们做出的牺牲，对吗，宝贝？”

对于这种伤感的表白，戴茜发出“咕咕”，戴米发出“喔喔”作答，美格于是把悲哀放在一边，来一下母爱的宣泄。这暂时安抚了她孤独的心情。但是，约翰后来竟然痴迷政治，总爱跑去和斯科特谈关心的问题，一点都不知道美格对他的惦记。这增加了她的痛苦。然而，美格一声不响，直到有一天，母亲看见她在抹泪，便一个劲儿地刨根问底，女儿的低落情绪是逃不过她的眼睛的。

“妈妈，除了你之外，我不会告诉人的。如果约翰再一意孤行，我和守寡没什么两样，我很需要指教。”布鲁克太太一边回答，一边伤心地用戴茜的围裙擦拭眼泪。

“乖乖，怎样一意孤行的？”母亲焦虑地问道。

“他整日外出不归啊，晚上我想见他时，他一直去斯科特家。我干的是最累的活，却没有任何欢乐，太不公平了。男人最自私自利了，连最好的也不例外。”

“女人也是如此啊。别责怪约翰了，先看看自己哪儿错了。”

“但他冷落我，怎么说也不对。”

“难道你没有冷落他？”

“哎，妈妈，我想你会站在我一边的！”

“就同情而言，没错。但是，我认为过错在于你，美格。”

“我不明白。”

“让我告诉你吧。当初你在夜晚他唯一的休息时间总是陪伴他的时候，约翰像你说的那样冷落过你吗？”

“没有，可现在我做不到，得照看两个孩子。”

“我想，你是做得到的，乖乖，而且应该做到。我能够随便说吗？你会记得是妈妈既同情你，又责怪你吗？”

“当然啦！给我说吧，就把我当作当年的小美格吧。自从两个孩子样样事都要找我照料，我就经常觉得，自己更加需要有人指教了。”

美格把矮脚椅子拖到母亲的身边。母女俩每人膝上抱着一个小捣蛋，一边不停地摇晃着，一边促膝谈心，感到做母亲的纽带让她们更加打成一片。

“你只是犯了多数年轻妻子犯过的错误——在关爱自己的孩子时，忘记了对于丈夫的责任。美格，这是一个很容易犯的错误，但也很容易得到原谅。但是，最好及时加以改正，免得分道扬镳成为习惯。孩子应该把你俩拉得更近，而不是离间你们，仿佛他们只属于你，而约翰除了抚养他们之外，一点儿都不相干。几个礼拜来，我都看得一清二楚，只不过没有吭声罢了。我肯定，这件事总会解决的。”

“恐怕不行啊。如果我请他待在家里，他会以为我嫉妒。我可没有想过用这样的念头侮辱他。他一直不知道我需要他待在家，我也不知道该怎样不用言语去让他明白。”

“把家搞得快乐一点，他就不会往外走了，乖乖。他也是渴望小家庭的，但没有你不成其为家了。可是，你总是待在育儿室。”

“不该在那儿吗？”

“不用一直在那儿。禁闭过长，会使你精神紧张，结果干样样事情都不合适。再说，你既欠孩子们东西，也欠约翰的。可别重孩轻夫啊。别把丈夫排斥在育儿室之外，应该教会他帮点儿事情。他跟你一样，在那里都有位置，孩子们需要他；要让他觉得有事可做，他会高高兴兴、勤勤恳恳地去做。这样，就会皆大欢喜的。”

“妈妈，你果真这样想的吗？”

“美格，我是很清楚的，我是过来人。没有亲身体会证明可行，我很少对别人提建议。你和乔小的时候，我就像你现在这样，总觉得好像不全身心都扑在你们身上，就是不尽职。我谢绝了所有帮助，可怜的父亲便只管自己看书，都让我一个人试验。我竭尽全力挣扎着，但乔让我受不了了。我对她娇生惯养，差一点儿惯坏了。你身体不好，我很焦急，急得连自己都病了。后来，父亲来帮忙了，一声不吭地张罗所有的事情，帮助可大了。于是我看见了自己的过错，从此生活就少不了他了。这就是我们家庭幸福的奥秘啊。父亲从不由于生意而推托涉及大家的些许家务职责，而我总是尽力不让家庭烦恼破坏自己对于你父亲职业的兴趣。许多事情上，我们各自去尽职，但回到家之后，总是分担家务。”

“妈妈，确实如此。我最大的愿望，就是在丈夫和孩子眼里成为像你那样的贤妻良母。告诉我怎么办吧。你怎么说，我就怎么做。”

“你一直是乖女儿。唉，乖乖，我要是你呀，就让约翰更多地参加照看戴米，男孩需要训练，无论何时开始，都不会过早。接着，我要去做自己常常提议的事情，让汉娜来帮助你。她是一流的保姆，你可以把宝贝孩子托付给她，自己去干更多的家务活。你需要锻炼了，汉娜会乐于做剩下的事情。这样，约翰便会再次找到自己的妻子。你要到外面去多走动走动，要忙得心情舒畅，因为，你可是家里的阳光啊。你心情阴沉，家里就不会有晴天。接着，尽量对约翰喜欢的一切都感兴趣——要和他谈心，让他读书给你听，要交流看法，以此来互相帮助。可不要因为你是女人而把自己封闭在纸板盒子里，要了解外面的世界，让自己积极参与进去，因为，这些事情都会影响你和你的家人啊。”

“约翰太聪明了。我担心，问他政治问题什么的，他会认为我十分愚蠢的。”

“我看他不会。爱可以遮盖众多的罪孽。除了他，你难道还可以尽情地去问谁？去试一试嘛，看他是觉得斯科特太太的晚餐好，还是你对他的陪伴更加温馨。”

“好吧。可怜的约翰啊！我担心自己把他冷落在一边，让他伤心透了。我还认为自己的做法对，他什么也没有说呀。”

“他尽可能不让自己显得自私自利，但想必已经觉得众叛亲离。美格，正是现在这个时候，小夫妻最容易疏远了，所以，现在夫妻俩最需要常待在一起。因为，新婚的柔情蜜意，不花精力去维护是容易淡漠的。小生命交给他们去训练的头几年，对于父母来说，没有任何时光能比这段时期更加美好，更加珍贵了。不要让约翰与孩子形同陌路，在这个充满考验和诱惑的世界里，要保证约翰一生平安。心情愉快，非他们莫属啊。通过他们，你们会学会而且应该也可以相知相爱。乖乖，我得说再见了，好好想一想妈妈的说教吧，觉得有道理，就照着去做吧。上帝保佑你们！”

美格仔细考虑了，觉得很有道理，于是，就去身体力行了，尽管一开始做得不完全如意。当然，孩子都在对她撒娇，发现蹬腿和哭叫会给他们带来想要的所有东西之后，便成了家里的主宰。妈妈在喜怒无常的孩子面前，成了可悲的奴隶，但爸爸可不是能够轻易就范的。有时候，对于吵吵闹闹的儿子，他会发一阵父亲的脾气，严厉管束，可是，心软的老婆就难受了。儿子戴米继承了父亲坚毅性格中的一点儿成分，当然，我们不称其为固执。每当这个小家伙认定一样东西，要做一件事时，即使花上九牛二虎之力，也无法改变那个坚持己见的小脑筋。妈妈认为，宝贝还太小，不应该教他学会克服恶习。但爸爸则认为，学会循规蹈矩越早越好。因此，戴米少爷很早就发现，每当跟“大大”较劲，总没有好果子吃。就像英国人一样，戴米尊重征服者，爱戴父亲。所以，父亲严厉的“不行”比妈妈的所有爱抚更深入孩子的心。

美格跟母亲谈话几天之后，决心试一个夜晚陪约翰。她安排了丰盛的晚饭，把客厅布置得井井有条，自己也穿戴得花枝招展。她很早就把孩子送到床上睡觉了。这样，不会有别的事情干扰自己的精心策划了。可惜戴米是难以俯首帖耳，最大的恶习就是不甘心去睡觉。那天夜里，他一心一意想闹个天翻地覆。于是，可怜的美格只好哼着歌谣，晃动小床，还得讲上一个故事，哄他睡觉。她使出了浑身解数，均以失败告终，戴米就是瞪着大眼。这时候，听话的戴茜早就睡熟了，胖乎乎的小东西一直很乖。可是，淘气的戴米却躺在床上，凝视着灯光，精神好得很，一副难以劝说入睡的模样。

“妈妈跑下去给劳累的爸爸倒茶，戴米好孩子，乖乖地躺着，好吗？”美格问道。只听过道门轻轻地合上，熟悉的脚步声，踮着脚走进了吃饭间。

“宝宝要吃茶！”戴米打算来凑热闹。

“不行，我会给你留糕糕当早餐，如果像戴茜那样瞌瞌。乖乖，好吗？”

“西（行）! ”说罢，戴米紧紧地闭上双眼，似乎在追赶睡眠，忙着去迎接盼望已久的白天。

美格赶紧利用这宝贵的机会，悄悄地跑下楼，满面春风地去问候丈夫。她头上的蓝色蝴蝶结是他最欣赏的。约翰一眼就看见了，惊喜地问道：“啊，小妈妈，咱们今晚多么开心。你有客人吗？”

“亲爱的，只有你啊。”

“是过生日、周年什么的？”

“不是，讨厌做邋遢鬼了，所以打扮了一番，换个花样。你在吃饭时，总是穿得干干净净，无论多么疲劳。所以，我有空时为什么不能也一样呢？”

“我穿得干净，是为了尊重你呀，亲爱的。”穿着过时的约翰说。

“彼此，彼此，布鲁克先生。”美格笑语应答，看上去又变得年轻而漂亮了。她一边朝约翰点头示意，一边给他倒茶水。

“嗯，真轻松愉快啊，又回到往日了。茶味道真好啊。亲爱的，祝你健康，喝了。”约翰安详神往地呷了一口。然而，好景不长。他刚放下茶杯，门把手便发出一阵神秘的咯吱声，接着，传来了儿子不耐烦的嗓音：

“卡（开）门，我要清（进）来！”

“又是这淘气的孩子。我告诉他一个人去睡觉的，现在，又下楼了，踏着帆布，要命的冷。”美格一边解释，一边应答。

“早上了。”戴米进了门，兴奋地说道。长睡衣优雅地搭在胳膊上，他在餐桌边奔跳着，卷曲的头发欢蹦乱跳。眼睛热切地盯着糕糕。

“不行，早晨还没有到。必须去睡觉，别给可怜的妈妈惹麻烦。这样，你可以尝到带糖的蛋糕了。”

“宝宝爱爸爸。”戴米机灵地答道。他正准备往父亲的膝上爬，违禁嬉闹一番，但约翰摇了摇头，对美格说了一句话。

“你叫他楼上待着单独睡觉，就得让他听话，否则，以后根本就不会顾忌你了。”

“是啊，没错。戴米，过来。”美格把儿子领走了，心里真想揍一顿这个扫兴的小家伙。但戴米在她身边又蹦又跳，还以为一到育儿室，就会分到贿赂。

戴米没有失望。妇人目光短浅，真的给了戴米一块方糖，然后，把他塞进被窝，吩咐天不亮，不准走动。

“西（行）! ”戴米假装发誓道，高兴地吮吸着方糖，认为自己旗开得胜。

美格回到座位，继续愉快地吃晚饭。这时，小鬼头又走出来了，大胆地要求道：“妈妈，还要糖。”这一下，可就暴露了母亲刚才的失职。

“这绝对不行。”约翰说道。面对可爱的小调皮，他没有心软。“这孩子只有知道去好好睡觉了，我们才会有安宁。你呀，当奴仆已经够久，该教训他一顿了，这样才会了结。把他按上床别理他，美格。”

“他不会待在楼上的。从来不那样，除非我坐在身边。”

“我来对付他。戴米，上楼睡觉去，听妈妈的话。”

“不嘛！”小家伙一边顶嘴，一边拿起令人垂涎的糕糕，大模大样地吃了一口。

“不准这样对爸爸讲话。你不走，就把你抱上楼。”

“走开，宝宝不喜欢爸爸。”戴米退到妈妈的裙子旁，寻找庇护。

但是，连那个庇护所也用不上了，他被移交给了敌人。一句“轻一点，约翰”令罪人闻风丧胆，一旦妈妈撒手不管，审判日就迫在眉睫了。可怜的戴米丢了蛋糕，谈笑间没了玩耍机会，被有力的手拖到了那张讨厌的床上。但戴米怒不可遏，居然公然反对约翰，上楼梯时，又踢又喊，大吵大闹。戴米刚被放在床上，便从一头滚到另一头，跳下床，向门口跑去，但很差劲，睡袍的下摆被抓住了，提溜回了床上。戴米就这样不停地折腾，直到小伙子筋疲力尽，于是便扯着嗓子号叫。戴米这样的发声练习，通常能够征服美格的心，但约翰坐在一边，就跟聋子似的不为所动。房间里，没有哄骗声，没有糖果吃，没有悦耳的摇篮曲，没有好听的故事，连灯都吹灭了。只有火炉里红色的火焰映衬出那“大黑黑”。对于“大黑黑”，戴米与其说感到害怕，倒不如说感到好奇。这种新秩序让他感到很不高兴，于是，他沮丧地大声叫喊找“妈妈”。原来，愤慨情绪渐渐止息了，被俘的霸主又想起了温柔的女奴。狂喊大叫之后，适时的哀哭撕痛了美格的心。她连忙跑上楼，哀求道：

“让我陪他吧，他会听话的，约翰。”

“不行，亲爱的。我已经对他说过，睡觉去，听你的话。所以，他必须睡下去，哪怕我在这儿坐一夜。”

“可是，他会哭坏身体的。”美格继续哀求，怪自己扔下儿子不管。

“不行，哭不坏的。已经哭累了，很快就会睡着，那样事情就解决了。今后，他就会懂得必须听话了。别插手，我会对付他的。”

“他是我的孩子呀。可不能让粗暴摧残他的心灵。”

“他是我的孩子。我不能一味地宠他，把他的脾气惯坏。下楼吧，亲爱的，把孩子交给我。”

每当约翰专横地发表见解时，美格总是俯首帖耳，而且，从来不为自己的顺从态度感到遗憾。

“约翰，就让我跟他吻别，好吗？”

“当然可以。戴米，对妈妈说‘晚安’吧。让她去休息。照顾你一整天，她已经很累了。”

美格总是认为，亲吻是制胜的法宝，吻过戴米之后，哭泣声轻下去了。他静静地躺在床上。极度伤心时，他曾经在被窝里大肆踢腾。

“可怜的小家伙，总算哭累了，该睡着了。给他盖好被子，再去安抚美格。”约翰心想。他轻轻地走到床边，希望看到叛逆的后嗣已经入睡。

可是，戴米没有睡着。就在约翰瞅他一眼时，戴米睁开了眼睛，小下巴开始颤动。他伸出胳膊，打着嗝儿，以忏悔的声音说：“宝宝现在摆（乖）了。”

美格坐在门外的楼梯上，发现吵闹之后出现了很长一段时间的寂静，就纳闷了。她想象里面出了各种各样的离奇大事，便悄悄跑进门去看个究竟，以便放下提起的心。只见戴米已经酣睡，不像平常那种四脚朝天的样子了。他就范了，身子蜷成一团，躺在约翰的臂弯里，握着他的手指，似乎心里明白了恩威并施的意思。他已经伤心地睡着了，却又一下子长大成熟了。约翰手指被困，就像女人一样耐心等待，直到小手松开。这时，约翰自己也睡着了，与其说工作一天疲劳了，不如说与孩子较劲折腾累了。

美格见父子俩并排枕着枕头，暗自笑了，接着，悄悄转身走开，满意地说：“我不用担心约翰对待孩子过分粗暴的。他知道该怎么管教他们，这是个很大的帮助。戴米对我来说，确实是太累人了。”

后来，约翰走下楼梯，心想妻子一定满脸思虑，或者一脸不高兴。但是，他看见美格正在平心静气地给一顶出客帽缀边，而且，还要求他读读报上有关选举的新闻，假如他不是太累的话。约翰不禁惊喜交集。他立刻明白了，一定有什么革命性的事情在发生，但知趣没有打听。他知道美格是个直性子的人，不会保留秘密日后救命用，所以，很快就会露出端倪的。约翰满口答应，读了一大段有关辩论的消息，然后，尽量清楚地加以解释。美格则摆出一副饶有兴趣的样子，不时地提一些有意思的问题，让自己的思绪围绕国家大事，而非那顶帽子。其实，美格暗中断定，政治和数学一样让人作呕，政治家的使命似乎就是指名道姓地彼此谩骂攻击。不过，她仅仅将女人的这些心里话藏在心里。后来，约翰停顿时，她摇了摇头，说了一句自以为像外交辞令的含混语：“哦，真不知我们该怎么结束。”

约翰笑了，看了她一会儿。美格手上正在凝神比对漂亮的系带和花边，连约翰刚才高声朗读都未能唤起这样的真实兴趣。

“为了我，她开始喜欢政治了，我也得为了她而喜欢女帽，这样才公平。”想到这儿，公正的约翰又大声说，“真是太漂亮了。这就是你说过的早餐便帽吗？”

“亲爱的，这可是出客帽啊！它是我最好的了，适宜听音乐会，或者上剧院了。”

“对不起。这么小，自然会以为，有时候你戴的，就是这种一阵风便会吹跑的帽子呢。怎么戴上去不飞走的呢？

“这两根系带可以用玫瑰扣系在下巴底下，就像这样。”说完话，美格戴帽演示了一番，然后，就怡然自得地望着约翰，令人怦然心动。

“帽子真可爱，但我更喜欢戴帽的脸孔，看上去又青春焕发，无比开心了。”这时，约翰在美格的笑脸上使劲地吻了一下，下巴下面的玫瑰扣就倒霉了。

“你喜欢，我很高兴，我还想让你哪天晚上陪我去听新音乐会呢。我很需要听听音乐，调整一下情绪。你愿意吗？”

“当然愿意。尽心奉陪，随你去任何地方。你很久没有出门了，所以，出去走走真是有说不完的好处。我特别喜欢这一套的。你是怎么想到这个的，孩子他妈？”

“嗯，前几日，我跟妈咪交谈过，告诉她我有多么紧张、焦躁，脾气不好。她说我需要调节一下，不要太操心。所以，汉娜要来帮我看孩子。我可以更多地料理家务，不时还可以乐一下。这样，就可以避免心情不安，不会未老先衰。约翰，这仅仅是尝试一下罢了，这样做，可是为了你我二人啊。最近我冷落了你，感到很遗憾。我打算尽力让我们家恢复以往的气氛。希望你不会反对吧？”

我们不用在意约翰都说了些什么话，也不用管那顶女帽九死一生，差一点点没有彻底损坏。我们所应该知道的是，从屋里和家里人慢慢的好转来判断，约翰显然没有表示反对。当然，生活不是天堂。但是，合理的分工，可以对每个人有好处。孩子有了父亲的管束，茁壮成长起来。一丝不苟、坚定不移的约翰给孩子堆里带来了秩序和顺从，而美格进行了大量的健身锻炼，来一点玩乐，她还经常和精明的老公一起促膝谈心，终于恢复了精神，稳定了情绪。这时，他们家又像一个家了。约翰也不想出门了，除非带上美格。现在，反而是斯科特一家来布鲁克家串门了。邻居们都认为，约翰的小房子真是一个欢乐的地方，充满了愉快的气氛，丰衣足食，非常温馨。连快活的萨利·莫法特都愿意去他们家。“这儿总是那么宁静宜人。美格，这儿对我很有益处啊。”她经常这么赞叹，而且，眼神左顾右盼，总是流露出渴望的神情，似乎很想发现那个护身符，以便移植到自家的大屋子里。她觉得，家里装饰得富丽堂皇，反而显得冷冷清清，家里没有孩子的戏闹声，更没有孩子阳光灿烂的笑脸。内德生活在自己的圈子里，并没有为她留下空间。

这家人的快活家庭生活并不是一朝一夕获得的。约翰和美格终于找到了幸福之门的钥匙。婚后生活的岁月，都让他们明白使用这把幸福钥匙的神机妙法，所以，他们能够打开天伦之乐、互助互爱的宝藏。这个宝藏，再穷苦的人都有可能获得，但再富足也有钱难买。这就是年轻的妻子和母亲们同意被束在那种高阁的原因。她们可以安全地摆脱世间的躁动与狂热，在那些依恋她们的幼儿稚女身上找到忠诚的爱，无惧悲痛、贫困与老龄。她们和一个忠实的朋友携手并进，同甘共苦。丈夫，在那优秀的英国古语里，真正意思就是“管家”。她们就像美格那样，认识到妇人最幸福的王国是家庭，而其最高荣耀并非作为女王的统治术，而是作为贤妻良母的家政术。





第三十九章　懒虫劳伦斯


劳里去尼斯，只打算住上一个礼拜，却耽搁了个把月。一个人独自闲逛，他已经感到厌倦了。然而，有艾美在一边陪伴，她那熟悉的身影，对于她融入其中的异国景致而言，似乎增添了家乡般的迷人魅力。劳里很怀念往日受到的“宠爱”，又旧梦重温，其乐融融。哪怕过往陌生人纷纷投来羡慕不已的眼神，其快意根本就无法跟家乡姑娘的爱慕相比。艾美绝不会像姐姐们那样宠爱他的，却很乐意看着他，贴近他，因为她觉得，他代表的是亲爱的家人。对于他们，她十分想念，尽管口头上不说。这时，他俩自然地为彼此朝夕相处而感到宽慰，相互之间可谓形影不离，不是一块儿骑马，一块儿散步，就是一块儿跳舞，一块儿闲逛。因为，在尼斯游玩季节，谁都无法老是辛勤工作。不过，他俩表面上在无拘无束地自娱自乐，却在漫不经心地了解对方，形成自己的看法。艾美在朋友的评价里蒸蒸日上，但劳里在她的评价里却下降了。他俩不用开口就心中有数了。艾美总想讨他喜欢，而且旗开得胜，因为，她十分感激劳里给予的许多快乐，经常为他做一点儿事，作为回报。对于这种照顾，母性十足的女人都知道该怎样添上超越言语的风情韵味。劳里却无所用心，看上去随心所欲，任其自然，试图忘掉过去。由于被女人冷落过，他觉得所有的女人都欠他一句友善的话。他非常慷慨，这根本不费吹灰之力，如果她愿意接受，他满可以把尼斯的饰件统统都买来相送。同时，他觉得自己很难改变艾美正在对他形成的看法，也怕看见艾美目光犀利的蓝眼珠，似乎在注视他时带有那种既悲伤又轻蔑的惊诧神情。

“大家今天都去摩纳哥了，但我喜欢待在家里，写几封信。信写好了，我打算去瓦尔罗萨玫瑰谷写生，你去吗？”天空爽朗，中午时分，劳里照例懒洋洋地走进门时，艾美凑上去问道。

“哦，好吧，不过，走这么远的路，太热了吧？”他慢吞吞地答道，刚才户外阳光眩目，阴凉的客厅十分诱人。

“我会去叫一辆四轮马车，巴蒂斯特来驾车。你只管撑阳伞，不用管其他事。手套都不会弄脏的。”艾美说着，讥讽的目光瞥了一眼一尘不染的小山羊皮手套，那是劳里的嗜好。

“那我乐意奉陪。”劳里说完话，便伸出手去接她的写生本。但艾美却将本子夹在腋下，尖刻地说：

“不麻烦了。我不费力，你倒看上去拿不动似的。”

劳里瞠目结舌，见艾美奔下楼，便步履悠闲地跟着走下楼。他们上了马车，劳里一把抓住缰绳。小巴蒂斯特无事可做，只好双臂抱着胳膊，在后车厢睡觉了。

他俩从不吵嘴——艾美很有教养，而眼下劳里懒得吵。不一会儿，他以好奇的神情瞅了一眼艾美的帽檐底下。艾美微笑相答，一团和气，双双上路。

马车沿着蜿蜒曲折的乡间车道轻快地行驶，沿途景色秀丽，令人赏心悦目。不一会儿，一座古老的修道院映入眼帘，飘逸入耳的是修道士们咏诵的那些庄重肃穆的赞美诗。后来，他俩看见一个戴着尖顶帽，光腿穿着木拖鞋的牧羊人。只见那人一个肩上搭着粗布上衣，坐在岩石上吹口哨。一只只山羊有的在岩石间奔跑，有的就躺在他的脚边。没多久，一队脾气温顺的灰色毛驴驮着一筐筐刚收割的青草，从路边经过，青翠草堆上要么坐着一位头戴宽边帽的漂亮姑娘，要么坐着一个老妇人，一路上不停地捻着纺织杆。路边的奇怪石棚子中，跑出不少浅色眼睛、棕色皮肤的孩子，兜售一束束鲜花和一个个带枝叶的橘子。放眼望去，漫山遍野都是枝节粗壮，叶片浓绿的橄榄树。果园里，金色的果实挂满枝头。路旁开满了红色的大银莲花。绿色的山坡和峻峭的山顶后面，白雪皑皑的滨海阿尔卑斯山，在意大利蔚蓝的天空下，高耸入云。

玫瑰谷真是名不虚传，一年四季，气候温暖，玫瑰花到处盛开。繁茂的花朵悬挂在拱道上方，伸出院门的栅栏，散发出宜人的芳香，欢迎过路的行人。柠檬树下，叶面柔软的棕榈树下，野花盛开，四处蔓延，一路生长，连山上的别墅旁，都能见到。每一处树阴下，开放的鲜花簇拥着散落的坐椅，让人见了就想停住脚步，坐上去歇息。这儿的岩洞，阴凉爽气，洞内的大理石仙子塑像在花瓣的掩映下微笑。这儿的喷泉，映照出的是或红或白的玫瑰花的颜色。这些垂挂的玫瑰花似乎都在为自己的美丽姿容流露出得意的笑容。这儿，家家户户的房墙上，都布满了玫瑰花，有的爬卧在飞檐上，有的缠绕在梁柱上，还有不少随意蔓延，在房屋露天平台的栏杆上生长。从高处眺望，可以看见阳光照耀下，波光粼粼的地中海，以及海岸边城中的白色房屋。

“这是蜜月旅行的天堂，不是吗？你看见过这样的玫瑰花吗？”艾美问道。她在屋顶的露天平台上停下脚步，欣赏眼前的景致，贪婪地呼吸随风飘来的浓郁馨香。

“没有，也没有碰到过这样的花刺呢。”劳里一边说，一边将拇指送进口中。刚才，他想伸手去摘一朵孤零零的鲜红玫瑰花，但就差一点距离，没有够着。

“弯下腰嘛，摘那些没有刺的。”艾美说完话，从身后鲜花点缀的墙上采摘了三朵奶油色小蔷薇，然后，把蔷薇插在对方衣服的扣子孔中，作为讲和的礼物献给劳里。劳里表情古怪地低头盯着三朵蔷薇，凝神了一会儿。他有意大利血统，有点迷信。此刻，他的心境是悲喜交加，好不郁闷，就跟那些富于想象的小伙子一样，能从小事中悟出奥秘，到处都有浪漫的题材。劳里刚才伸手去摘那棵带刺的红玫瑰时，想到了乔，她就配生动艳丽的花朵，身上常戴家中温室里摘下的这种玫瑰。而艾美刚才递给劳里的浅色蔷薇是意大利人捧在死者手里的，婚礼的花环从不使用这种。这时，劳里犹豫了一会儿，不知这不祥之兆是针对乔的，还是他本人。但他很快就恢复了美国人的常识，战胜了多愁善感，并爽朗地开口大笑。出国以来，艾美从未听他这样笑过。

“是个好建议，你最好从善如流，保全手指要紧。”艾美说道，心想自己的话把劳里逗乐了。

“谢谢，我会的。”他玩笑着答道。殊不知，几个月之后，他却真心诚意地照办了。

“劳里，什么时候去你爷爷那儿？”艾美突然问道。问完话，她坐在一个树枝编制的座位上。

“很快。”

“这三周来，你说过无数次了。”

“我想，简洁的回答可以免掉麻烦。”

“他盼着你去，你确实应该去。”

“你真热心！我知道的。”

“那为何没有行动？”

“我想，天生堕落吧。”

“你的意思是生性懒惰。真可怕啊！”艾美说话时，一脸严肃。

“还没这么严重。去了他那儿，只会烦他，所以，我不妨就待在这儿，再烦你一阵子，你忍受能力强。其实，我想，这样非常适合你的胃口。”劳里调整了身体，准备躺在栏栅的宽阔横木上。

艾美摇了摇头，以逆来顺受的神情打开速写本。其实，她已经决定教训一下这小子。没过多久，她又开口了。

“你在干什么呀？”

“看蜥蜴。”

“不是这个意思。我问你打算，或者希望干什么？”

“我想抽支烟，可以吗？”

“你真气人！我不赞成抽烟，除非你让我把你画进速写才可以。我需要人影。”

“愿意效劳。你怎么画我——是全身的，还是大半身，画倒立呢，还是直立？我斗胆建议，画一张卧姿吧，然后，把你自己也画进去，取名《无所事事乐融融》。”

“别动，如果你喜欢，睡觉也行。我可要大干了。”艾美精力充沛地说道。

“真是热情高万丈！”他心满意足地靠在一只巨型陶瓮上。

“乔如果现在看见你，会说什么呢？”艾美不耐烦地问道，希望提到比她更精力充沛的姐姐大名之后，能够激发劳里的热情。

“老一套，‘走开，特迪。我很忙！'”劳里笑着说道。但他的笑容并不自然，脸上掠过一丝阴影，熟悉的名字刺痛了心中还未愈合的伤口。劳里的口气和面色都打动了艾美，先前见过这种面色，也听过这种口气。她抬起头，正好看见劳里的表情变了——一副严峻愤恨的神态，满脸痛苦，不满现实，悔恨交加。但艾美还未仔细端详，该表情早已消失，恢复了一副无精打采的模样。艾美以艺术的愉悦注视了劳里一阵子，心想，他多么像意大利人啊。只见他沐浴在阳光下，头上没有遮盖，眼睛里流露出南国的梦幻感，他似乎忘记了身边的姑娘，沉醉于幻想之中。

“你看上去就像一位躺在墓穴上的年轻骑士。”她一边说，一边细心地勾勒画像的线条，深色岩石的背景，轮廓清晰的剪影。

“希望如此啊！”

“愚蠢的愿望，除非你早已空度一生。你变化太大了，有时候，我想——”但说到这里，艾美停顿了，神情半羞半神往，此时无言胜有声。

劳里心领神会，明白了艾美欲言又止，所要表示的温情的担心。他直视艾美的双眸，以往常跟她母亲说话的口吻讲道：“没事的，小姐。”

艾美听罢满意了，将近来开始惹她揪心的疑虑都抛到了一边。劳里的话还感动了她。她说话时亲切的口吻就表明了这一点。

“你能这样想，我真高兴！我也并没有认为你是一个严重的恶少，不过，想来你也许在德国巴登巴登那个鬼地方浪费了不少钱，要么连心都被哪个迷人的法国有夫之妇勾走了，要么在异国他乡陷入困境。一些年轻人往往认为是出国旅游在所难免的。别待在太阳底下，过来，在草地上躺一会儿，以前，乔邀我坐在沙发的一角，开始聊秘密时常这样说：让我们友好地在一起。”

劳里顺从地往草地上一躺，将一些雏菊插在旁边地上艾美帽子的系带上，自娱自乐。

“我早就准备好了，快讲秘密吧。”劳里抬头看了一眼，眼里明显露出饶有兴趣的神情。

“我没有什么可讲。你说吧。”

“没有福气拥有秘密。我还以为，你大概收到了家里的消息。”

“最近的消息你都听过了。难道你不是经常听到的吗？还以为乔会给你寄许多信。”

“她很忙。我到处游逛，你知道，不可能按时联系。你什么时候开始艺术大作呢，我的女拉斐尔？”劳里停顿了一会儿，突然问道，将话题转开。其实，刚才他在纳闷，艾美是否了解自己的秘密，想谈论它了。

“永远不做。”艾美答道，口气沮丧，但却斩钉截铁，“罗马灭了我的虚荣心，看了那里的艺术奇迹，我觉得自己活在世界上真是十分渺小，失望中，就放弃了所有不明智的期盼。”

“你如此精力充沛，才华横溢，为什么要这样呢？”

“问题就在这儿——因为，才华不是天才，精力再充沛也无法造就的。我想要么成名成家，要么一事无成。我不想成为一名平庸的画匠，所以，就不想再努力了。”

“敢问你现在自己有何打算？”

“磨炼自己的其他才能，为社会增光添彩，当然，得有机会。”

艾美的讲话很有个性，听上去很有魄力。年轻人就得无所畏惧，而且艾美的抱负具有良好的基础。这时，劳里笑了。艾美发现自己长期向往的目标无望实现，便毫不迟疑地另起炉灶，没有愁眉苦脸。这种精神，他很喜欢。

“好哇！我说，那个弗雷德·沃恩就在这里插足了。”

艾美审慎地保持沉默，但低垂的脸上露出一丝会意的神色。劳里见了，赶紧坐起身，板起脸问道：“我现在当你的哥哥，问几个问题，行吗？”

“不保证一一回答。”

“你呀，嘴硬，面软。乖乖，你可不是那种深藏不露的情场老手啊。去年，我听到过你和弗雷德之间的流言飞语。我个人认为，如果不是他突然奉诏回家，又绊住那么久，嗨，会发生什么事了吧？”

“这不该我来回答。”艾美一本正经地回答，但嘴角还挂着一丝笑容。她的眼神泄露出火花，坦白了她的内心世界：了解自己的魅力，并因此而得意非凡。

“希望你还没有订婚吧？”劳里一下子变得就像一个大哥哥，看上去很严肃。

“没有。”

“但你会的，假如他回来，在你面前规矩地跪下，不是吗？”

“很可能。”

“那么，你喜欢弗雷德这个老家伙？”

“如果我接受了，那自然就是喜欢他了。”

“但是，时机不到，你是不打算接受了，是吗？天哪，真是异乎寻常的谨小慎微啊！他是个好人，艾美，但不是我心目中你会喜欢的那种男人。”

“他有钱，而且温文尔雅，风度翩翩。”艾美答道，试图让自己显得沉着冷静，不亢不卑，但她感到有一点儿不好意思，尽管她是真心诚意的。

“知道了。社交女王可离不开钱啊。所以，你打算嫁得好，而且就此开始生活？世道就是这样的嘛，很不错，循规蹈矩，但从你母亲的女儿嘴里说出来，却有点儿怪异。”

“然而千真万确。”

回答相当简洁，但说话时的平静和断然却一反常态，小姑娘的表现很奇怪。劳里本能地感觉到这一点，便又往草地上一躺，带着一副自己难以说清的失望感。他的这种神态以及他的沉默，还有那种发自内心的自责，让艾美感到生气。于是，她决定立刻教训他一顿。

艾美口气尖锐地说：“希望你帮个忙，给我提起精神来。”

“你帮帮我提吧，乖乖女。”

“有可能，如果试试看。”艾美看上去似乎真的雷厉风行。

“那么就试试看吧。我准许你。”劳里答道。他长期独自一人，茶余饭后，就爱戏弄人。这可是久违的消遣。

“过五分钟，你就会生气的。”

“我从来不跟你生气的。单块火石打不出火来的。你呀，就跟白雪一样冰冷柔软。”

“你不知道我的能耐。雪如果堆积得当，也会发光，也会刺眼。你无动于衷，其实，有点儿做作。好好刺激一下，就能证实。”

“尽管来刺激吧，伤害不到我的，或许你倒会快活一阵。就像大男人说的那样，小妻子揍大丈夫——隔靴搔痒嘛。就把我当成丈夫，或者一块地毯吧。可以一直打到精疲力竭，如果这样的锻炼运动对你挺合适的话。”

艾美着实恼怒，加上很想看见劳里能够摆脱那种使他大变的淡漠情感，便削尖了铅笔，口气也尖利逼人地问道：

“弗洛和我给你取了个新名字，叫‘懒虫劳伦斯’，喜欢吗？”

艾美以为劳里会生气，但他仅仅将胳膊垫在头下，心如止水地说：“不错呀。谢谢女士们。”

“你想知道我对你的真实看法吗？”

“洗耳恭听。”

“好吧，我鄙视你。”

哪怕艾美用怒气冲冲，或者撒娇的声音说“我讨厌你”，劳里都会大笑，而且很喜欢听的，但这一次，艾美的嗓音却低沉伤心，劳里听了不禁睁开眼睛，立刻问道：

“请问为什么啊？”

“因为，你本可以做一个正直有为的好男孩。但你却屡犯错误，让消沉和痛苦去折磨自己。”

“语重心长啊，小姐。”

“愿意听，我可以接着讲。”

“愿闻其详，真有意思。”

“我想，你会觉得有意思的。自私自利的人总爱谈论自己的。”

“我也自私吗？”劳里听罢，不禁大吃一惊，随即脱口而出地问了一句，因为，慷慨大方是他引以为豪的唯一优点。

“是啊，而且相当自私。”艾美接着说，嗓音沉稳冷峻，其效果简比平时的气话更有杀伤力，“我可以说明根据的：我们在一起嬉笑逗乐时，我注意过你，对你感到很不满意。你已经出国将近半年了，可以说，一事无成，就知道消磨时光，挥霍钞票，让你的朋友非常失望啦。”

“苦学了四年，我难道不能快活一下呀？”

“你看上去可没有十分快活呀。反正你依然故我，我可以这么说。我们刚见面时，我说过你有长进。现在，我收回原话，因为我看你还没有我出国那时候一半好呢。你已经懒得令人作呕，而且喜欢说一些闲言碎语，把时间都浪费在鸡毛蒜皮的小事上。你还醉心于愚人的宠爱奉承，并没有得到智者的爱慕尊崇。你有金钱，有才华，有地位，有健康，还有英俊潇洒——啊，你喜欢那个‘名利场’！这可是千真万确的，所以我不得不指出来——你有这么些美妙东西去使用，去享受，你居然会觉得，除了游手好闲，简直无事可做。你没有做可能成为也应该成为的那种人，却仅仅是——”突然，艾美的话戛然而止，脸上流露出痛苦而怜悯的神情。

“火上煎熬的圣徒劳伦斯啊。”劳里冷冰冰地补充成句。但是，姑娘的训话开始生效了，劳里的眼神透露出一丝如梦初醒的火花，刚才那副漫不经心的样子不见了，脸上的表情看上去既恼火又受伤。

“我想你会这么说的。你们男人都说我们女人是天使，还说我们能够随心所欲地把你们变成什么人。但是，一旦真心诚意地想为你们着想，你们马上就嘲笑我们，听不进去，这只能证明你们的奉承话到底价值多少。”艾美愤愤地说道，背对着正坐在自己脚边令人发火的殉道者。

不一会儿，一只手捂在速写纸上，使她无法画下去，接着，劳里模仿悔过孩子的滑稽口吻说道：“我要学好，啊，我要学好的！”

然而，艾美并没有笑，她可是认真的。这时，她用铅笔敲击着劳里张开的手，一字一句地说道：“你难道不为这只手感到羞耻吗？就跟女人的手一样柔软白皙，看上去似乎只会戴朱汶牌高级手套，为女士采摘鲜花而已，别的事，什么都没有干过。谢天谢地，你又不是花花公子，所以，我很高兴看见，除了乔很久以前送给你的那枚又小又旧的戒指之外，手上没有戴什么钻石戒指，或者大图章戒指一类的玩意。亲爱的，我真希望，她也在这儿，能够帮助我！”

“我也如此啊！”

手抽了回去，跟刚才伸出一样突然。听了艾美的祝愿话，他的回应里现出了足够的力量，连艾美都高兴起来。她低头朝他看了一眼，脑子里顿时闪过一个新念头，但劳里正躺在地上，用帽子半遮着脸，似乎是在遮阴，而大胡子则遮住了嘴。艾美只看见他的胸膛随着一声深呼吸起伏着。那深呼吸就像是一声叹息，他那只戴着戒指的手垂在草丛里，似乎在隐藏一件连提都不宜提及的珍贵或是脆弱的东西。顷刻间，拉拉杂杂的提示和琐事在艾美的脑海里拼凑成形了，产生了意义，她明白了事情的原委，原来姐姐没有向她吐露啊。她记得，劳里从未主动谈及乔的事情。她想起了刚才劳里脸上掠过的阴影，他性格上的转变，而他戴的那枚旧戒指并不配用来装饰一只漂亮的手。女孩子观察这种迹象的速度是极快的，而且迅速感受到了那无言的控诉。艾美曾经想象，或许转变的根源是爱情的纠葛，现在，她已经确信了。敏锐的眼睛热泪盈眶，这时，她又开口说话了，嗓音则控制在最为委婉温柔动听的程度。

“我知道，自己是没有权利跟你这么说话的，劳里。如果你不是世界上脾气最好的小伙子，你一定会跟我生气的。可是，我们都很疼爱你，都为你而感到骄傲，所以，想到家里人会像我一样对你感到失望，我就很不忍心，尽管他们也许比我更理解你的变化。”

“我想，他们会的。”声音来自帽子底下，语气冷淡，听上去有气无力，令人哀伤。

“他们早就应该告诉我，不要让我继续错上加错，乱责备人，我原本应该格外亲切，格外宽宏大量的。我从来都不喜欢那位兰德尔小姐，现在我讨厌她了！”艾美机巧地说道，希望这次能够确认自己觉察的事实。

“去他的兰德尔小姐！”劳里一边说，一边把帽子从脸上推开，脸上的表情毫无疑义地说明他对那位小姐所怀有的感想。

“对不起，我还以为——”她突然很有策略地停止了。

“不，别以为了。其实，你最清楚了，我除了乔，任何人都不爱。”劳里说这句话时，跟以往一样口气冲动，而且，一边说，一边转过了头。

“我就是这么以为的。但他们关于这件事只字未提，你又出国，所以，我猜想，自己搞错了。难道乔不肯对你好吗？哎，我肯定，她爱你爱得很深。”

“她确实很亲切，但却不到位。如果我就是你认为的那种不成大器的人，她不爱我就很幸运。不过，她看错人了，你可以转告她的。”

劳里说话时，脸上的神情又恢复了严峻愤恨的样子。这让艾美感到为难，她不知道这会儿该使用何种安慰剂。

“我自己搞错了，不知道情况。很对不起，刚才态度太粗暴，现在不免要希望你能够善加忍受，特迪乖乖。”

“别这样，那是她给我取的名字！”劳里急速地挥手，制止了艾美模仿乔的那种柔中带骂的口气。“等你亲身试一试再说吧。”劳里又低声加了一句，顺手一把一把拔草。

“我会像男子汉一样坦然对待的，没有得到爱，也要得到尊重啊。”艾美情况不明决心大。

你看，劳里一直庆幸自己对此事忍受得相当好，既没有埋怨，也没有企求同情，而将自己的苦恼带在身边，独自排解。艾美对他的教训，使得他换一种角度看待那件事了。他第一次体会到，头一次失恋就灰心丧气，自我封闭，郁闷冷漠，看上去未免就显得很意志薄弱，自私自利了。他觉得自己似乎突然从一场思绪万千的睡梦中惊醒，再也无法入睡。没过多久，他坐了起来，慢悠悠地问道：“你认为乔会跟你一样，看不起我吗？”

“如果她看见你现在的样子，会的。她一向讨厌懒虫。你何不干一番轰轰烈烈的事情，迫使她爱上你呀？”

“我已经使出了浑身解数，但是没有用啊。”

“你是指毕业成绩不错吗？这不过是你的分内事，为你爷爷做的。花了那么多的时间和金钱，如果不毕业，是很可耻的。因为大家都知道，你可以出色毕业的。”

“不管你怎么说，反正败局已定，因为乔不肯爱我。”劳里说道，心灰意冷地用手支着头。

“不，你还有机会，最终你会承认的，因为，学业对你有好处，证明了只要你努力，还是能够干出个模样的。你只要找到另一件事情去做，很快就能够恢复到舒心愉快的心境，忘记自己的烦恼。”

“这不可能。”

“努力去争取嘛。你不必耸肩，认为‘这姑娘对这种事情知道得不少’，我并不是自作聪明，而是在仔细观察，所发现的比你想象的要多。我很关心别人的恋爱经历和矛盾行为，尽管不能加以解释，但可以记在心里，以后为我所用嘛。当然，如果你愿意，就一辈子都去爱乔吧，但不要因此而失意。不能因为自己得不到所要的一个福气，就抛弃许多美好的东西，这样做是作恶。哎，我可不想继续训话了，因为，尽管那个姑娘心肠很硬，但我知道你会幡然醒悟的，重新做一个真正的男子汉。”

他们俩一时间寂寞无语。劳里坐在草地上，摆弄着那个小戒指。艾美正在对说话时所作的速写做最后的润色。过了一会儿，她将速写本放在他的膝上，径直说了一句话：“觉得怎么样啊？”

劳里看了一眼，不禁笑了，因为画得太妙了——修长的、懒洋洋的身子正躺在草地上，表情淡然，眯着眼，手上夹着一支雪茄烟，袅袅烟圈笼罩着做梦人的头部。

“画得真不错啊！”他说道，对艾美的速写技巧感到由衷的惊喜。接着，他又似笑非笑地加了一句：“是呀，那不就是我吗。”

“这是现在的你，而这是过去的你。”艾美又拿出一张速写，放在旁边。

这一张画得不怎么样，却很有生气和灵气，足以弥补许多的败笔。这张画生动地勾勒了如烟往事，小伙子见后，脸上的神情不禁为之一变。只见画面上寥寥数笔，显示劳里正在驯马，没有戴帽子，外套脱掉了，所以，身段活跃，线条清晰，面色果敢，威风凛凛的姿势，整张画洋溢着一股青春活力，耐人寻味。画中那匹彪悍的马已经驯服，正站在一边，被缰绳勒着脖子，低着头，蹄子一个劲儿地刨着地面，但耳朵却竖立着，似乎在聆听征服者的号令。鬃毛散乱，骑手头发蓬松，神态警觉，表现化动为静的画面，让人体味到力量、勇气和青春活力，跟《无所事事乐融融》速写的躺卧式优雅形成鲜明对比。这时，劳里一言不语，眼睛在来回扫视。艾美发现他脸红了，并且抿着嘴唇，似乎已经理解了她的意思，接受了教训。对此，艾美很满意，不等劳里开口，爽朗地说开了：

“有一天，你让拉里和帕克那两匹马比赛，我们都在观看，记得吗？美格和贝丝都吓坏了，但乔却拍手欢腾。我当时骑在篱笆上，为你画速写。前几天，在画夹里找到了这张速写，稍微润色了一下，就一直保存着，打算给你看。”

“感激涕零。自那以后，你的速写技巧突飞猛进，恭喜恭喜。虽然在‘蜜月天堂’，我能否冒昧地提醒，你下榻的饭店，晚餐时间在下午五点？”

劳里说着站起来，一边笑着鞠躬，将画像归还，看了一下表，似乎在提醒她，即便是道德说教，也应该结束了。这时，劳里又想摆出以往那副随意而无所谓的样子，但这一次，却很做作了，因为，艾美振聋发聩的谈话很灵验，尽管他不愿意坦白。艾美觉察到一丝冷淡的态度，思忖道：

“是我惹怒了他。哎，如果对他有好处，我就高兴了。如果让他讨厌我，那就很遗憾了。这确实是我的真心话，决不反悔。”

回家的路上，他们又说又笑，身后坐着的小巴蒂斯特心想，先生小姐真是兴致勃勃。可是他们俩都感到很不自在。原先彼此之间坦诚相待的情趣已经扰乱了，阳光明媚的天空出现了一片乌云。尽管两人表面上仍然谈笑风生，但彼此已经打心底里暗自不满了。

“我们今晚可以见到你吗，mon frère[1]? ”在婶婶的门口分手时，艾美问道。

“不凑巧，我有约在先了。Au revoir, mademoiselle[2]。”劳里说罢，弯下腰，似乎要以外国方式去吻她的手。这可是劳里最拿手的，谁都比不上。艾美看见他的神情，急忙态度和蔼地说：

“不行，跟我来老规矩，劳里。咱们还是和以前一样告别吧。我喜欢英国的热烈握手，不喜欢法国人那些伤感的离别礼节。”

“再见，乖乖。”劳里以艾美喜欢听的口吻说完这句话，跟她握了握手，握手热烈得手痛，然后走开了。

第二天早晨，没有像往日那样的拜访，但艾美收到一个便条。她看见之后就笑了，但没有过多久，便叹气了：





我的良师益友：

请代我向你婶婶告别，愿你开心，因为“懒虫劳伦斯”像好男儿一样，陪祖父去了。谨祝冬安。愿上帝保佑你，在玫瑰谷的蜜月幸福美满！我想，弗雷德有了搅和者，会受益匪浅的。请转告他，并致祝贺。

感谢你的　忒勒玛科斯[3]





“好小伙！他走了，太好了。”艾美带着认可的微笑说道。但是，她回首望着空荡荡的房间时，面色就变了，情不自禁地叹息道：“是啊，我很高兴，可是又会想念他的！”

第四十章　死亡幽谷


最初的痛苦熬过去之后，一家人都接受了这个无法避免的结局，并努力乐观地面对，用更多的爱相互帮助。在困难关头，这种温馨的爱把一家人紧紧凝聚在一起。他们忘却悲伤，尽心尽力，让贝丝幸福地走完人生的最后一年。

家里最舒适的房间已专门为贝丝准备好了，里面集中了她最心爱的每一样东西——鲜花、绘画、钢琴、小工作台，还有可爱的小猫。父亲最爱看的书籍也搬到了那儿，当然，母亲的安乐椅、乔的书桌以及艾美的速写精品都用来布置她的房间了。每天，美格都抱着孩子，温情地过来朝圣，给贝丝阿姨带来阳光般的快乐。约翰默默地存起了一小笔钱，以源源不断地给病人提供她渴望能够吃到的心爱水果，他自己也从中得到了快乐。老汉娜乐此不疲地烹调美味佳肴，来引诱百味难调的胃口，一边干活，还经常流泪。时常收到一些漂洋过海寄来的小礼物和热情洋溢的信件，似乎给她带来了那些四季如春的异国土地所散发的温暖、芬芳气息。

贝丝在这儿得到无微不至的关怀，就像家族圣徒一般，被供奉了起来。可她还是一如既往，那样文静，那样忙碌。一切都改变不了她那善良、无私的本性。即便打算离开人世间，她还是尽力让留在世上的人生活得更加幸福。她那双细弱的手一刻都停不住。她的一个乐趣就是为每天过往的小学生制作一些小玩意儿——从自己的窗户里往外扔一副连指手套，送给一位冻紫了小手的孩子；或者给那些拥有许多洋娃娃的小母亲准备一本缝针纸夹；或者为那些歪歪扭扭练字的孩子提供用布料做的揩笔垫；她还为喜爱绘画的孩子做剪贴簿，还有各种各样的小巧文具。后来，这些正在学习的阶梯上勉强攀登的顽童都得到助力，求学的道路仿佛铺满了鲜花，可以说，这些孩子都把这位善良的捐助人看做了某种神仙教母。贝丝高高在上地就座，慷慨地抛洒礼品，神奇地满足着孩子们的不同口味和需求。如果贝丝需要得到什么回报的话，那就是在她窗前抬头嗷嗷待哺的一张张幼小的灿烂笑脸了，有的不停地向她点头，有的则一个劲儿地微笑。当然，寄给她的那一封封墨迹斑斑、天真烂漫的简短感谢信，也就是她所想得到的回报了。

开始的几个月，贝丝过得非常愉快。每当全家人坐在那阳光明媚的房间里，她会环顾四周，赞叹道：“这里太美了！”两个小孩在地板上摸爬叫闹；母亲和两个姐姐在旁边干活；父亲则用悦耳动听的嗓音读书，这些书历史悠久、充满智慧，书中有大量劝慰人的金玉良言，虽然几个世纪过去了，至今仍然具有说教作用。房间成了小教堂，当牧师的父亲在给家人羔羊群上课，虽然很难，却是人生必修课。他努力使她们明白，只要心中怀有希望，就能给爱心带来慰藉；只要心中信仰坚定，就能使人顺从命运。简单的说教深入人心，因为父亲的心皈依了牧师的信仰，而时常哽咽的声音使他的布道倍加意味深长。

大家都很知足，毕竟她们度过了这段宁静的时光，为后来悲伤时刻的降临做了铺垫。随着时光的推移，贝丝说手上拿着的缝衣针很重，就永远放下了针。说话使她感到疲倦，见面使她感到不安，痛苦吞噬着她。病魔折磨着她虚弱的肌体，悲哀的是，还扰乱了她宁静的精神。至爱亲朋被迫面对那双骨瘦如柴的手伸出来向她们哀求，听着那撕心裂肺的哭喊：“救救我！救救我！”他们终于绝望了。噢，天哪！多么难熬的白天！多么漫长、漫长的黑夜！多么痛苦的心灵！多么诚恳的祈祷！一个安详的灵魂黯然失色了，年轻的生命与死神展开一场激烈的较量，上帝总是仁慈的，这两者都很短暂。接着，本能的反抗结束了，往日的平静气氛以壮丽无比的气势重新回归贝丝的生活。尽管贝丝的病体已经弱不禁风，可心灵却更加坚强了。虽然她寂寞无语，可身边的人都感到她已做好了准备，发现第一个被召唤的朝圣者同样也是尘世生存的适者。他们陪她等在岸上，希望看到，她到达彼岸时，有光芒四射的天使来迎接她。

贝丝对乔说：“你在这里，我感觉更有力量。”从那以后，乔离开贝丝的时间再也没有超过一个小时。她睡在房间的长沙发上，不时地醒来给炉火加点柴，喂她吃，扶她起来，精心照顾病人。但这位坚韧的病人很少提出要求，尽量不成为一个累赘。乔对其他护士都猜疑，所以整天都守在房间里，并为被指派照看贝丝而感到自豪，这成了她一生中的最高荣誉。这对乔来说也是宝贵而又有益的时光，因为这时她的心灵学到了急需的教义：忍耐，以亲切的方式教授，而且她不折不扣地学会了；对人的仁爱之心，这是一种可贵的精神，能够原谅并且彻底忘却不友善的行为；忠于职守，能使最困难的问题都迎刃而解；还有虔诚的信仰，毫无畏惧，一心一意地信任。

乔夜里醒来，常看到贝丝在读那本翻旧了的小宝书，听到她轻声吟唱，以此打发失眠的长夜；有时也看到她用手捂着脸，泪水顺着透明的指缝慢慢地往下淌。这时，躺在沙发上的乔默默地看着她，思绪万千，顾不得哭了。她觉得，贝丝用淳朴无私的方式，用神圣的安慰词、默默的祈祷和酷爱的音乐，正努力从心爱的现世中解脱出来，去适应来世的生活。

最明智的布道、最圣洁的赞美诗、最狂热的祈祷都没有比这更使乔触动。泪水洗净了乔的双眸，极度的悲伤软化了她的心灵，她终于看到了妹妹生命中魅力——平平淡淡，与世无争，却充满了真正的美德：“散发着芳香，在尘世间盛开”。她那忘我的境界，使世间最微贱的人最早在天堂扬名。而这种货真价实的人生功绩并非每个人都能达到。

一天夜里，贝丝在自己的书桌上翻阅一堆书籍，想寻找一点东西，好忘却如同病痛一样难以忍耐的厌世心态。忽然，她在翻阅心爱的小说《天路历程》时，看见一片纸，上面是乔一行行潦草的诗句。这时，一个名字首先映入她的眼帘，只见那一行行诗句字迹模糊。她断定，那是落在纸上的泪珠造成的。

“可怜的乔！她已经熟睡。不用把她叫醒取得阅读许可了。她把自己的一切都给我看的。看看这个，我想她不会介意的。”贝丝看了一眼姐姐，心想。只见姐姐正躺在地毯上，身边放着一把火钳，炉火中的木块一旦烧塌，她会随即惊醒。

我亲爱的贝丝





耐心坐在幽暗处，

等待祥和的光降临。

心灵宁静，人品圣洁，

超升着我们烦恼的家庭。

人间的悲欢离合、希望祝愿，

都在人生大河的肃穆岸边，

如浪花飞溅，转眼即逝，

而她则心甘情愿，屹立河岸。





妹妹呀，要从我身边离去，

脱离人世冷暖和挣扎。

请将美化你的生命的

那些美德留赠于我。

乖乖，给予我那伟大耐心吧，

它强大无比，

能够在痛苦的牢笼中，

保持无怨无悔，开颜欢笑。





智勇双全，温柔甜美，

把这些都留给我吧，我太需要了。

有了这些美德，

脚下人生职责之路始终常青。

把无私的品格也留给我吧，

以神圣的仁爱，

去以德报怨——

温良的心，宽恕我的过失吧！





我俩的分离，

于是在一天天减轻离别的痛苦。

明白了这一无情的道理，

我的巨大损失也就成为收获。

忧伤的接触，

会使我的不羁性格走向平和，

赋予生活新的追求，

对于未知世界抱有新的信赖。





从今之后，坦然越过人生之河，

我将永远看到

等在彼岸的你，

可爱而恋家的精灵。

希望和信念源于伤痛，

将会成为护卫天使。

妹妹先我而去，

但天使的双手会把家给我指引。





尽管诗句字迹模糊，墨迹斑斑，语句有误，笔触无力，但贝丝看了脸上呈现出一种难以名状的欣慰。她心中唯一的缺憾就是一生碌碌无为，但眼前的诗句却让她感到放心。她的生活并非一事无成，所以，死后不会引起她所担心的绝望。就在她拿着折叠的那片纸坐着时，突然，烧焦的木头坍塌了。乔惊醒，重新拨旺了炉火，然后，蹑手蹑脚地走到贝丝的床边，希望看见她还在熟睡。

“乖乖，我没有睡，还挺高兴呢。瞧，我找到了这个，都看过了，我知道你不会介意的。乔，难道我对你真意味着一切吗？”贝丝满怀希冀和恭敬，认真地问道。

“噢，贝丝，真的这么多，真的这么多！”说罢，乔把头靠在妹妹的枕边。

“那我就不觉得自己是虚度一生了。我虽然不如你说的那样好，但我一直都在试图行事正确。现在，想让一切都好上加好，为时已晚。但知道有人那么疼爱我，觉得我曾经帮助过他们，这对于我来说，就是莫大的安慰了。”

“贝丝，世界上无人能够比得上你。我想过，不能就让你这样离别。我现在学会了这种感觉，我不会失去你的，你比以往任何时候离我都要近。死亡是无法使你我分离的，尽管看上去似乎会那样。”

“我明白的，所以我对死亡早就不害怕了，因为我确信，我将仍然是你的贝丝，一如既往地爱着你，帮助你。乔，我走了之后，你必须替我做父母的心肝宝贝。他们会依靠你的，不要让他们失望。一个人独自工作艰难的话，就请记住，我不会忘记你的。你不去撰写力作，不去周游世界，一心干活，会更加愉快的，因为，人间的爱是我们离开时唯一能够随身携带而走的东西。有了爱，会走得很轻松。”

“贝丝，我会尽力而为的。”乔当场就放弃了往日的志向。她发誓要拿起新的更好的志向，承认了其他欲望的虚幻，体味爱的恒久信念所孕育的至福慰藉。

春天来去匆匆。天空越来越晴朗，大地越来越葱绿。鲜花早早地盛开，候鸟都按时飞返故地，陆续向贝丝告别。贝丝太疲倦了，就像一个听话的乖孩子，紧紧地牵着父母领了她一辈子的手。现在父母又要亲切地领着她走过死亡幽谷，把她交给上帝。

除了在书中，弥留之际的人很少会说出令人难忘的话，也不会看到显灵，更不会面带极乐的脸色离开。那些多次为人送终的人都知道，对于大多数的人而言，最后的时刻来临时，倒是十分自然的，简直就跟睡眠一样简单。正如贝丝希望的那样，“退潮顺利”。在黎明前的黑暗时分，她依偎在母亲的胸前，就在来到人间第一次呼吸的地方，她轻轻地吸了最后一口气，没有道别，只有深情的一瞥，一声轻轻的叹息。

母亲和两个姐姐流着眼泪为贝丝祈祷，轻轻地为她的长眠做准备。现在病痛永远不会再打扰她安睡了。贝丝过去脸上有一丝哀婉的坚韧，这曾经让她们揪心了那么久。很快她们感激地看到，贝丝显出了那种美满的安详。她们带着虔诚的喜悦感到，对于她们的宝贝，死亡是仁慈的天使，而不是可怕的鬼怪。

早晨，炉火灭了，乔的位置上见不到人，房间里静悄悄的，好几个月里，这还是第一次。但是，不远处刚刚吐出嫩芽的树枝上，一只小鸟在欢快地歌唱；窗边，雪花莲也绽开了笑脸。春天的阳光照进房间，仿佛要祝福枕头上那张安详的脸——一张毫无痛苦、充满宁静的脸，那些深爱着它的人破涕为笑，她们感激上帝，贝丝终于没事了。





第四十一章　学会忘记


艾美对劳里的教训确实很有效，当然，他到了很久以后才肯承认这一点。男人很少会承认的，妇女提出建议时，大老爷们并不会采纳的，除非让他们确信这果真符合自己的意图。然后，他们就会付诸实施，而如果事后获得了成功，弱女子的成绩却只算一半；如果失败了，他们便大方地全部归咎于她们。劳里回到了爷爷身边，一连几周承欢膝下。老先生大悦，宣布尼斯的气候对他恢复健康很奏效，还说不妨再去那儿试试。小先生原本再高兴不过了，但自从挨了骂之后，就是用几头大象也难将他拖到那儿去了。自尊心不允许啊，每当愿望强烈之时，他就是反复地唠叨这么几句刻骨铭心的话，“我看不起你。”“干一番轰轰烈烈的事情，迫使她爱上你吧。”来加强自己不去的决心。

劳里心里经常在琢磨这件事，不久，便承认自己既自私又懒惰。不过，话说回来，男人遇到了大悲，就应该尽情胡闹一通，直到挺过痛苦。他觉得自己的苦恋几乎都快死翘翘了。尽管他会念念不忘，忠实哀悼，却没有理由去公然披麻戴孝的。乔不会爱他了。然而，他可以通过行动证明，姑娘说一声不同意，并没有毁掉他的一生，从而迫使她尊重自己，甚至羡慕自己。他劳里始终打算去大干一番的，艾美的建议则是可有可无的。他仅仅在等待时机，要把上述的苦恋厚葬而已。完事以后，他就感到应该化悲痛为力量，大干一番。

正如歌德无论遇到欢乐和忧愁，都会将其化为诗歌一样，劳里决意把自己的失恋用音乐记载，使之永垂不朽。他打算谱写一首安魂曲，让乔的灵魂不得安宁，让每一位听的人都感到心碎。因此，老先生再次发现他神魂不定，情绪忧郁，便打发他走开时，他去了维也纳。那儿有他的音乐界朋友。不久，他就开始发奋，不干出点名堂绝不罢休。然而，或许他心中的悲伤太深广，无法用音乐表现，或许音乐太虚无缥缈，无法拔除人世间的悲痛，他很快就明白，目前，他还没有能力谱写安魂曲。很明显，他的头脑还没有处于工作状态，他的思想需要澄清，因为，谱写哀怨的旋律中间，他时不时地哼起一首舞曲，令人清晰地回想起尼斯的圣诞舞会，尤其是那位法国矮胖子，于是就十分有效地暂时停止构思悲剧的曲调。

后来，劳里又尝试创作歌剧，因为，开头似乎并没有什么难，可是，他又被不期而至的困难围困了。他打算把乔作为剧中的女主人翁，接着，搜索枯肠，想提供有关自己爱情方面的温情逸事和浪漫憧憬。可是记忆背叛了他。仿佛被姑娘的任性精神所驾驭，只记得乔的形形色色古怪行为，经常犯错误和常常心血来潮，而且笔下的乔仅仅表现出毫无情调的方面——不是头上扎着大手巾，在拍打垫子，就是用沙发靠垫封锁自己，或者对他的音乐创作热情泼冷水——发出一阵阵无法抵御的嘲笑，破坏了他努力描绘的忧愁景象。所以，乔无论如何都放不进他的歌剧，结果，不得不放弃。他说一声“她真折磨人！愿上帝保佑她。”扯了一下头发，就像一个心烦意乱的作曲家。

劳里开始四下里寻找一位不那么难对付的女郎，将她写成不朽的旋律。这时，他回想到一位不请自来的人选。这个人物造型具有多种面目，但头发总是金黄色的，周身薄雾缭绕，就在他的心目中漂浮游荡，附近宜人地混杂着玫瑰花朵，孔雀、白色矮种马和蓝绸带。劳里没有给这位自己感到满意的幻想角色取名。但他决定将她作为女主人翁，而且非常钟爱她。这是十分自然的，因为劳里把天下所有女人的天赋和风度都赋予了这个角色，并且毫发不损地护送她通过各种考验，尽管考验足以消灭任何一位凡人女子。

由于这个灵感，他写起曲子也一度像行云流水，可是，该作品慢慢地变得索然无味了。他经常手里拿着笔，坐在那儿沉思默想，忘记写字，或者游逛那快乐之城，想获取新创意，廓清头脑。那年冬天，他的头脑似乎有点儿七上八下。他做事不多，但思考得很多，意识到某种变化正在不由自主地发生。“那大概就是天才的火花吧。我要让它继续燃烧，看看会有什么结果。”他自言自语。可是，他内心却一直在怀疑，那点儿思绪火花并不是什么天才，而是更为普通的东西而已。当然，不管是什么，还是燃烧得像模像样，因为，他对自己自由散漫的生活，感到越来越不满意了。因此，他开始渴望干一些脚踏实地的工作，能够全身心地投入。最后，他十分明智地断言，不是热爱音乐的人都可以成为作曲家的。一天，劳里在皇家大剧院聆听了气势磅礴的莫扎特大歌剧，回家之后，他翻阅了自己创作的歌剧脚本，演奏了几处精华片段，便坐下凝视着门德尔松、贝多芬和巴赫的半身塑像，只见他们还是在慈祥地看着自己。突然，劳里将自己谱写的歌曲一页一页撕得粉碎。最后一张纸片从手中飘落后，他清醒地自言自语：

“她说得对啊！才华并不是天才，你是无法以人代天的。就像罗马让她摆脱了虚荣一样，大师的乐曲唱掉了我的虚荣。我不能自欺欺人了。可是我该干些什么呢？”

这似乎是一个难以解答的问题。劳里开始希望自己不得不打工糊口。当然，甘愿堕落的合适机会现在就出现了。他曾经强调过这一点，因为，他很有钱，但无所事事。谚语云，撒旦就爱让有钱人游手好闲。可怜的劳里受够了来自自己内心和外界的各种诱惑，但他出色地经受了考验，这主要因为，尽管他崇尚自由，他更加珍惜忠诚和信任。他向爷爷做过保证，自己也希望能够诚实地面对那些爱他的妇人们说出“一切都好”，这样也就使他安然无恙、稳妥可靠。

格伦迪太太[1]很可能会这样评论：“我才不信呢，男孩就是男孩。男子汉年轻时就会拈花惹草，女人绝不能期望奇迹出现。”但是，我敢说，这位挑剔的太太可以不相信，但这可是千真万确的。女人可以创造许多奇迹，因为，我认为，她们通过拒绝附和格伦迪太太之流的胡言乱语，甚至可以创造更大的奇迹，即提高男子汉的道德标准。就让男子汉像个男子汉的样，无论多久，都不为过。所以，男人年轻时，熬不住的，就让其风流倜傥吧。然而，母亲、姐妹和朋友都可以助上一臂之力，别让其出格，别让稗草毁了收成。她们的手段是相信，而且表明自己相信，让男人忠于美德是可能的，可以在良家妇女眼中表现得像个堂堂正正的男子汉。如果这是女人的误解，那就不妨让我们沉湎于其中吧，因为，如果没有女人的上述规劝，生活中的美和浪漫情怀就会失去一半，而悲哀的预言就会让我们对勇敢善良的小伙子所寄托的各种希望化为痛苦的泡影。本来，那些小伙子疼爱母亲胜过关心自身，而且并不耻于承认这一点的。

劳里原本以为，让他忘记自己对乔的爱慕心情，那得竭尽全力好多年，但最近，他很惊讶地发现，这件事情正在日趋容易。起初，他拒绝相信自己的感觉，而且，想到这件事就生气，觉得真是不可思议。但是，人心都是奇怪的，矛盾的，时间能改变一切，事物的客观变化往往不以人的意志而转移。劳里的心不再感到痛苦了。当他内心的创伤迅即愈合时，他本人倒大吃一惊。于是，他非但没有设法忘记，反而试图牢记在心。他并没有料到自己的恩怨纠葛会出现这种转折，所以，一点准备都没有。他开始责备自己了，对自己多变的态度感到惊诧。他既失望，又轻松，百感交集，毕竟可以很快就从沉重打击状态下解脱了。他曾在熄灭的爱情火堆里细心地吹拨，可是没有重新燃起火花。只见爱情的火堆舒适宜人，足以温暖他的心，但不至于让他重新头脑发热。他不得不承认，毛头小伙子狂热的爱情已经逐渐退潮成宁静的爱慕之情，非常温柔，不过有一丁点儿伤心或者怨恨，但不久肯定会消失，最终，他所保留的那份情感就是兄妹情谊了，而且，牢不可破，一直持续到底。

劳里在沉思默想中，脑海里掠过“兄妹情谊”一词时，不禁笑了，接着，抬头看了一眼身前的莫扎特画像：

“嗨，他可是伟人啊，走了身边的姐姐，就找了妹妹，照样幸福快乐。”[2]

不过，劳里并没有将心里话说出口，而是思量着。过了一会儿，他吻了一下手上戴着的那枚旧戒指，自言自语道：“不行！我没有忘记，永远做不到的。我要再争取一次，但是，如果这次失败，嘿，那就——”

劳里话没有说完，便拿起纸笔，开始给乔写信，想告诉她，只要她回心转意的一线希望还存在，自己就一直心绪不定，无法做事。难道她不能吗，难道她不愿意，何不让他回家，做幸福的人呢？等待乔回信时，他什么事情都没有干，但他的等待却是炽热如焚，急不可耐。后来，回信终于来了，让他彻底死心，因为，乔在信中说，她毅然决然，既不能，也不愿意回心转意。她埋头于服侍贝丝，再也不想听到“爱情”两个字了。不过，乔还求劳里幸福美满地另觅佳偶，他只要在心里给亲爱的乔妹留一小块位置就行了。另外，乔在附言中要求劳里，希望不要将贝丝病情恶化的消息告诉艾美，反正她会在开春时回家，没有必要让艾美在剩余的日子里感到悲哀。感谢上帝，时间还绰绰有余的。劳里可得经常给她写信呀，不要让她觉得孤独，想家，焦虑。

“好的，立即照办。我担心，可怜的小姑娘，回家会让她伤心的。”这时，劳里打开书桌抽屉，似乎给艾美写信就是最合适的收尾办法了，去结束几周前没有完结的那句话。

但是，劳里当天并没有写信，翻找最漂亮的信纸时，他发现一件东西，不禁改变了初衷。在一个抽屉里，账单、护照、各种商务信函堆里有几封乔寄来的信；另一个抽屉里，有三张艾美给他的条子，用她的一条蓝绸带细心地扎着，亲切地提醒有一朵小小干玫瑰夹在里面。这时候，劳里的表情有点儿悔恨，又有点儿好笑。他把乔的信都收集起来，一封封捋平，折好，放进书桌的一个小抽屉，然后，站在书桌边上，若有所思地摆弄着手指上的那枚戒指，慢慢地将其摘下，和信件放在一块儿，锁上抽屉，走出屋子，去聆听圣·斯蒂芬教堂的大弥撒。他觉得似乎参加了葬礼，尽管自己并非不胜悲哀，但是，这似乎是消磨一天所剩时间的好办法，比在家里给迷人的女郎写信强多了。

然而，信寄出去之后很快就有了回音，因为，艾美非常想家，而且在信中推心置腹地甜蜜吐露。后来，两人之间的书信不断增多，初春时期，定期书信来往从未间断。最后，劳里把自己的那几个音乐家塑像都卖掉了，把自己创作的歌剧付之一炬。然后，他去了巴黎，希望有人不久也会到达。其实，他很想去尼斯，但没有收到邀请，他不会去的。艾美是不会请他去的，她正在那儿小事不断，很想避开“我们的男孩”的探询目光。

弗雷德·沃恩回来过，提出那个问题，她曾经决定这样回答的：“好的，谢谢！”但是，现在她的回答是：“不了，谢谢。”口气虽然和蔼，但是非常坚决，因为，就在那个紧要关头，她一时失去了勇气，她发现要有比金钱地位更重要的东西，才能使她心中的新渴望得到满足，因为，她当时心里充满了温柔的希望，当然，也有不少恐惧。她记起了一句话，“弗雷德是一个好人，但不是我心目中你会喜欢的那种男人。”劳里说这句话时的音容笑貌，还历历在目，就像她自己口头不说，面容实际上说“我嫁人就是为了钱嘛”时的表情一样挥之不去。现在，回想起这句话，她就感到心里不安，真希望能够将其收回来，因为，现在听上去，太不像女人说的话了。她不想让劳里认为她是一个无情无义的女人，一个世俗的家伙。她现在已经不奢望去当社交贵妇人了，只想成为一位惹人喜爱的女人。想到这里，她很高兴，劳里没有因为她说了那些混账话而厌恶她，而是把那些话当成她的娇声嗲语，对她更加宠爱了。劳里写给她的那些信是很大的宽慰，因为家信非常不定时，而且收到之后，读上去索然无味，根本不及劳里的信合意。答复这些信件，不仅仅是快事一件，而且是履行义务，因为，那个可怜的家伙孤苦一人，需要宠爱，而乔一直铁石心肠。其实，乔应该有所表示，竭力去爱他的。这样做并不很难。许多人如果碰到这么一位可爱的小伙子关爱自己，都会很高兴，很自豪的。但是，乔和别的姑娘从来都不同，所以，她只能好好地对待他，把他当兄长，别无其他举动了。

如果天下所有的哥哥都像劳里现在这样得到女人的关注，那就是幸福美满的人，完全不同于现在的境地了。艾美现在早已不训人了，各种事情都向劳里征求看法，凡是劳里做的事，她都很感兴趣，还给劳里制作了不少精巧可爱的小礼物。她每周都会给劳里写两封信，信里谈的都是逸闻趣事，妹妹的心里话以及一些令人神往的周围景色速写。哥哥很少会得到如此礼遇，妹妹把他的书信放在衣袋里随身携带，反复阅读回味，来信简短了要失声痛哭，来信较长则亲吻一下，还会作为细软加以珍藏。所以，我们并不是在暗示，艾美干了这种可爱的蠢事。不过，那年春天，她确实有点儿面色苍白，心事重重的样子。她对社交活动失去了一大半兴趣，只是常常一个人出去画速写。回家时，她从未拿出多少画来给大家看，我可以断定，她仅仅在观察自然，她会独自一人叉着双手，在玫瑰谷的平台坐上好几个小时，或者心不在焉地将头脑里的任何奇思妙想速写下来——一位雕刻在墓碑上的彪形骑士，或是一位在草地上用帽子遮住眼睛的酣睡年轻人，有时候也会画一位盛装华服的鬈发女郎，和身材高大的绅士挽着胳膊在舞厅里漫舞，而且根据最时尚的艺术画法，两个人面部都搞得模糊不清。这样处理，虽然在画法上比较保险，但绝对不能让人感到满意。

婶婶以为她在为自己给弗雷德的答复追悔不已。艾美觉得，否认徒劳无益，也解释不清。她也就听任婶婶自己去怎么想，不过她留心让劳里知道，弗雷德已远去埃及。就那么简单，但劳里懂，而且看上去如释重负，他带着倚老卖老的神气自言自语道：

“我早就肯定她会改变主意的。可怜的老家伙！我是过来人，可以感同身受的。”

劳里说罢，长叹了一口气。接着，似乎他已经卸下了过去的一切的负担，在沙发上架起脚，兴趣盎然地欣赏起了艾美的来信。

国外发生这些变故时，国内的家中出现了丧事。告知贝丝身体每况愈下的家信并没有抵达艾美的手中，下一封到她手里时，贝丝的坟头已经绿草萋萋了。噩耗是在沃韦到达她身边的，由于天气炎热，五月份，她们避暑离开了尼斯，慢条斯理地去瑞士旅行了，途中经过了热那亚和意大利的湖区。她很好地挺过去了，一声不响地服从了家里的嘱咐，没有缩短行程，因为，当时赶回家为贝丝送别，已经太晚了。所以，她不妨就待在国外，让远离家园的旅行化解心中的悲哀。但她的心情是沉重的，渴望能够待在家里，所以天天抬头望着大湖对岸，等待劳里赶过来安慰自己。

劳里果然很快就赶过来了，因为，同一艘邮轮把信件寄给了他们俩，可是他当时在德国，迟了几天才送到他手上。他刚看完信，就整理好背包，告别同路人，起程实现自己的诺言。他的心里悲喜交加，既有希望，也有悬念。

劳里对沃韦很熟悉。所以，船一靠上小码头，他就沿湖边急急忙忙向塔楼奔去。卡罗尔一家都寄宿在那儿。但是，侍者很绝望，全家都去湖上兜风了，不对，金发碧眼的小姐或许就在大花园里。如果先生费神坐下等，她片刻就回来了。但先生连片刻也等不及，话才说了一半，就亲自去找她了。

令人赏心悦目的古式花园位于美丽的湖边，园内栗树成荫，沙沙作响，常春藤随处攀爬，阳光照耀的湖面映照出湖边塔楼的长长而浓郁的倒影。花园的围墙很长，但不高，墙角有一个座位，艾美经常来这里看书或者干活。她也以四周的美景安慰心情。那天，她就坐在这儿，单手支着头，心系家乡，目光沉凝，惦念贝丝，不明白劳里为何还不来。她没有听见劳里穿越前面庭院时的脚步声，也没有看见他正站在通往花园的暗道边的拱廊旁。他停留在那儿有一分钟，以新的眼神望着艾美，端详出了别人看不出的变化——她性格中的温柔一面。艾美身上的一切都暗示着爱和悲——放在膝上的那些字迹斑斑的信件，扎在头上的黑带，脸上泛着的女人特有的痛楚和耐心，甚至连挂在脖子上的乌木十字架在劳里看来都悲哀。因为，那是劳里送给她的，她把它当成自己唯一的饰物佩带。如果说，劳里对于艾美将会如何迎接自己仍有疑虑的话，那么，就在艾美抬起头看见他的一刹那，一切疑虑都打消了。艾美不顾身边落下的东西，连忙呼叫着朝劳里奔跑过去，情真意切，思念万分：

“啊，劳里，劳里，知道你会来看我的！”

我想，此时此刻，一切都在无言中了，一切都定下了。他们俩一言不语，站在原地过了一阵，黑头发垂下头保护着黄头发。这时，艾美心想，除了劳里，没有任何人能够带来这么好的宽慰和支撑，而劳里也斩钉截铁地认为，世界上只有艾美这个女人才能替代乔的位置，才能让他幸福。当然，劳里并没有把心里话说出来，但艾美并没有失望，因为，两人都感觉到了那个事实，都心满意足，彼此之间就没有必要再费唇舌了。

后来，艾美又回到刚才坐的地方。在她擦眼泪的当口，劳里拣起了散落在地的纸张，看见信都破旧了，还有意味深长的速写，觉得是未来的好兆头。他在艾美身边坐下时，艾美又害羞了，想到自己刚才迎接时的冲动，脸不禁红得像一朵玫瑰花。

“我刚才真是情不自禁呀，感到非常孤独，很伤心，所以看见你真开心。抬头看见你真令人惊讶，正在担心你不会过来了。”艾美说话时，想装出一副轻松自然的样子，可惜装得不像。

“我收到信，就赶过来了，失去了可爱的小贝丝，希望能够说几句安慰你的话，但是，我只能感觉，而——”劳里话未说完，他突然间也害羞了，一时间不知道该怎么说。他很想让艾美把头靠在自己的肩头，请她痛痛快快地哭一场，但没有胆量做，于是仅仅握住艾美的手，用力握了一下，表示同情。这要比说话安慰有效。

艾美温和地说道：“你不用讲话，这样就是对我的安慰。贝丝现在好了，很幸福，我真不能希望她回来。但我害怕回家，尽管很想见他们大家。现在，我们不谈这事，一说我就会流泪。你在这儿，我想和你玩个痛快。你不要马上回去，行吗？”

“可以，如果你需要我，乖乖。”

“很需要你，太需要你了。婶婶和弗洛都很客气，但你好像是家里人一样，哪怕和你在一起时间不长，也很舒服。”

艾美的言谈举止看上去真像一位一心一意思念家乡的孩子，所以，劳里一时间竟然忘记了自己的羞怯，满足了她的需要——她所习惯的爱抚和她所需要的快乐交谈。

“可怜的宝贝，你看上去似乎都悲哀成病了！我会照顾你的，别哭了，跟我一起去散一会儿步吧。这儿风太冷，不能坐着不动啊。”劳里劝慰道，口气既爱护，又不容分说，艾美可喜欢了。接着，劳里系好了艾美的帽子，挽起她的手，准备在吐出嫩叶的栗树下，沿着阳光明媚的小路散步。这时，劳里觉得走走更加轻松，而艾美靠在一只结实有力的胳膊上，望着一张熟悉的笑脸，听着独自对她在娓娓而谈的亲切嗓音，也觉得非常爽快。

精巧的古园里曾经有过不少恋人，好像就是为他们专设的。这里阳光和煦，空旷幽静，只有一座塔楼在俯视着院落，湖水在下面泛着涟漪，宽阔的湖面带走了恋人们窃窃私语的回声。劳里和艾美这一对新恋人边走边谈已经有一个小时。他俩有时候靠在院墙上休息一阵，欣赏眼前的甜蜜感应，它给时间和地点增添了无穷的魅力。当吃晚餐的扫兴钟声敲响时，艾美觉得，似乎心中的孤独和悲伤都丢在这个大花园里了。

卡罗尔太太看见那姑娘面色改变了，立即想到一个新主意。她顾自大喊道：“我现在都明白了——那孩子一直都在思念小劳伦斯。天哪，我万万没有想到这种事情啊！”

这位善良太太非常有见识，值得赞许，她一言未发，心照不宣，只是热情地请劳里住下来，而且恳求艾美好好陪他，这样，比独自孤独要好得多。艾美是温顺的模范，由于婶婶大量时间在操心弗洛，只留下她去招待朋友，而且，招待得还比往常出色。

在尼斯，劳里比较闲散，艾美经常训斥他。在沃韦，劳里就闲不着了，总是精神抖擞地散步、骑马、划船，或者学习。艾美则对劳里干的每一件事都感到钦佩，而且，一步一个脚印地、雷厉风行地跟着学。劳里说，这种变化得归功于气候的变化。艾美随声附和，很高兴将其也作为她自己身心康复的借口。

这儿，新鲜的空气对他们俩都有好处，大量的锻炼不仅改善了身体状况，而且改善了精神状态。他俩在绵绵不绝的群山中，似乎更加明确了人生观和责任感。清新的和风吹散了令人沮丧的疑虑，吹走了虚假的幻想，吹开了忧郁的雾霭。温暖的春天阳光让人萌发了各种雄心壮志，产生了无数温柔的希望，并且，形成了很多乐观的想法。那一池湖水似乎冲走了过去的愁苦。雄伟壮丽的亘古高山慈祥地低头俯视着他们，似乎在说：“孩子们啊，彼此相爱吧。”

尽管有新的哀伤，但是，眼下的时光还是非常幸福的。劳里觉得很愉快，一句话都不愿意说，生怕影响这种气氛。他的初恋愈合得如此神速，曾几何时他还坚信那是他最后的和唯一的爱情呢，思前想后，他好一阵子才从惊讶中恢复过来。他认为，乔的妹妹几乎就是乔的化身，并且坚信，除了艾美，这么快如此深情地爱上其他女人是根本办不到的，他以此来安慰自己表面上的不坚贞。劳里当初求爱时，犹如急风暴雨，如今，他怀着怜悯和遗憾交织的心情回顾它，恍如隔世。他没有感到不好意思，仅仅将其当作一段甜酸苦辣的人生经历而抛至脑后，失恋的痛苦挨过之后，这段往事他还感到挺感激的。他决定，自己第二次求爱应该尽可能平静、简化，没有必要搞排场，几乎不需要告诉艾美自己对她的那份爱。她早就明白了，无需言语表白，而且，很早就得到了她的答复。那种爱情来得自然而然，水到渠成，没有人可以抱怨，所以，他知道人人都会满意的，甚至乔也会同意的。当然，人们第一次小小的爱情风波受到挫折之后，大家都容易变得谨小慎微，放慢了第二次尝试。所以，劳里任凭日子一天天过去，欢度每一个小时，等待机会到了才倾吐，而那句话将结束他新的罗曼史中最甜蜜的第一部。

劳里甚至还想象过，自己爱情的圆满结局将会在月光照耀下，于那个城堡花园内发生，而且会气氛幽雅，彬彬有礼，但结果正相反，因为，那是中午，他俩在湖上说了几句干脆的话之后，就把彼此相爱的大事给解决了。那天上午，他俩荡舟湖上，去了不少景点，从湖边肃穆的圣然戈夫划到阳光明媚的蒙特勒，一面是阿尔卑斯山脉的萨瓦地区，另一面是圣伯纳德峰和米迪峰，而俏丽小城沃韦坐落在山谷中，远处，可以眺望日内瓦湖北岸的洛桑。只见湛蓝的天空，万里无云，湖水碧波荡漾，湖面星星点点的游船，犹如一只只在贴着水面飞翔的白翼海鸥，真是好一派诗情画意的景象。

劳里和艾美在船上划过锡荣城堡时，谈论起了波尼瓦[3]，后来，他俩抬头看见岸边的克拉朗，就讨论卢梭[4]，作家就在那个地方创作了名篇《新爱洛伊丝》。他俩都没有读过那本小说，但知道那是一部爱情故事，而且都在暗自思量，那个故事是否能够抵得上自己有趣的爱情经历的一半。有时候，谈话歇下时，艾美就用手抚弄湖水。她抬头张望时，发现劳里靠着浆，眼神里有一种表情。艾美看见之后，总是迫不及待地跟他讲话，其实，也就是没话找话而已：“你一定很累了。歇一会儿，我来划吧，这对我有好处。你来了之后，我就一直很懒散，养尊处优。”

“我不累，不过愿意的话，你可以划一支浆。这儿还有足够的空位呢，但我必须尽量坐在中间，否则船就不平衡了。”劳里答道，似乎很喜欢这种安排。

艾美心想，自己还没有把事情修补好，便在劳里让出的三分之一座位处坐下，然后，将飘荡在脸上的头发甩开，接过了浆。她划得很出色，她做事情一般都这样。尽管她用双手，劳里用一只手，但双桨节奏划一，游船在湖面上平稳地前进着。

“我们一起划得真好，不是吗？”艾美反对暂时的沉默。

“划得太好了，我希望能够和你一辈子同舟共济，好吗，艾美？”劳里温柔地问道。

“好的，劳里。”艾美低声回答。

这时候，他俩都停止了划船，无意中给湖面上随着水波而散开的无数倒影增添了一点人间的爱情美满画面。

第四十二章　孤家寡人


一个人的自我由另一个自我所包裹，心灵由动人的榜样所净化时，发誓要自我克制是十分容易的。可是，以往萦绕耳边的谆谆教诲已经沉默，每日的戒律已经结束，而且心中热爱的人已经离别，所剩下的只有孤独和悲哀时，乔觉得就很难再去履行自己的诺言了。每当自己的心无休止地疼痛，想念逝去的妹妹时，怎么能够去安慰父母啊。贝丝离开了居住多年的老家，换了新家，家中原有的光明、温馨和美好的气氛似乎都荡然无存，这时，怎么能够让她“给这个家带来欢快的情调”？天底下哪里能够让她“找到一份既有用又开心的活儿”，来替代她往日本身就是回报的爱的服侍呢？所以，她只能十分迷茫而无望地干自己的分内活儿，同时在内心悄然抵制着它。对于乔来说，本来就不多的快乐减少了，肩上的担子加重了。她越操劳，生活就越艰苦，这好像很不公平合理。生活对于有些人总是阳光明媚，而对于有些人则总是阴云弥漫，这太不公正了。乔学好，付出的努力比艾美多，但是，除了感到失意，碰到麻烦和累得要命之外，从未得到任何回报。

可怜的乔啊，她的生活真是暗无天日。每当她想到下半辈子将会在那座寂静的屋里度过，整天为一些单调无味的事情操劳，得到些许微小欢乐，而且，自己的分内事似乎永远都不会减轻时，就会感到近乎绝望。“不能这样下去了。我来到世上可不是要这样生活的，我知道的，如果没有人来帮我，我会冲出去，我会铤而走险的。”每当乔初战失败，强烈的意志不得不屈服于不可避免的事态，觉得心情痛苦郁闷时，总是这样自言自语。

但是，后来确实有人来帮她了，尽管乔没有一眼辨认出这些善意的天使，因为外形都很眼熟，用的也都是最适合可怜人的简单魔法。乔经常在夜里惊起，以为贝丝在召唤她，看见那张空床，就会情不自禁地伤心落泪。“哦，贝丝，回来吧！回来吧！”果然，她并没有白白地伸出双臂，就像她过去迅即听见妹妹微弱呼叫一样，母亲马上听见了她的抽泣，就过来安慰她，不仅以言相劝，而且亲切地爱抚她。母亲的眼泪默默提醒，她的悲恸比乔更深，母亲哽咽的低语比平时的祈祷还要雄辩。虽然她也无可奈何，但她在忧心忡忡的同时，心里总是抱有希望的认命。夜深人静，庄严时刻，心心相印，驱灾祈福，这样，悲哀可以解除，爱心可以增强。乔有了这种感觉，在母亲怀抱的安全庇护下，觉得重担似乎容易负了，分内事儿干起来也有味了，生活看上去要容易忍受了。

痛苦的心得到一点安慰时，烦恼的心灵也会得到救助。一天，乔去了书房。见那善良的灰白头发脑袋抬起来，以宁静的微笑迎接她，她低头谦卑地说道：“老爸，跟我谈一会儿吧，就像跟贝丝一样。我比她更需要，因为，我完全弄错了。”

“乖乖，你这么信任我，我感到莫大的安慰。”父亲一边颤声地说道，一边搂住乔，似乎他自己也需要别人的帮助，而且不怕恳求。

然后，乔坐在贝丝的小椅子上，紧紧地靠着父亲，诉说自己内心的苦闷——失去妹妹的愤懑悲哀，碌碌无为的挫折感，缺乏信念使生活看上去那么黯淡，以及我们称之为绝望的悲观迷茫。她对父亲无所不谈，父亲也给予她急需的帮助，父女俩都从中得到了宽慰。事到如今，他们交谈已经不仅仅局限于父女关系，而且也是男女之间的交谈，相互之间都能够给予同情，都乐于给予关爱。旧书房里的时光是令人愉快而又让人思绪万千的，乔称为“单人教堂”，她离开这里时总是勇气倍增，心情从新爽朗，精神更加谦恭。父母亲曾经教育一个孩子视死如归，现在又开导另一个不要沮丧地迎接生活，要相信生活，要满怀谢意，朝气蓬勃地抓住生活中的各种美好机会。

乔还得到过其他帮助——谦卑、健康的职责和乐事，无法拒绝它们服侍她的反哺作用，她对此也逐渐地觉察到了，也知道该如何去珍视了。现在，扫帚和洗碗布再也不会令人讨厌了，因为贝丝过去把持着这两样东西，所以，时至今日，小拖把、旧刷子这些东西似乎仍然让人想起贝丝勤俭持家的家庭主妇风范，都没有扔掉。乔使用这些东西时，嘴上总是哼着贝丝喜爱的歌曲，模仿她的有条有理，不时地收拾一下东西，把家里安排得井井有条，温馨舒适。这是营造一个幸福家庭的第一步，但乔一直不知道，直到汉娜赞许地握着她的手说：

“你想得真走（周）到，你决心尽自己的可能，不让我们过多地想念那可爱的羔羊。我们虽然不多说，但看在眼里，上帝会保佑你的，看着吧。”

乔和美格坐在一块儿缝纫时，发现姐姐真是今非昔比了，谈吐竟然那么广博，对于什么是高尚，妇女的内心冲动、思想情操都了解得那么透彻，而说到丈夫孩子，她往往喜不自胜，他们彼此互相互爱，相濡以沫。

“毕竟，婚姻是一件好事嘛。假如自己争取，我不知道结果能否及得上你的一半？”乔说话时，已经在零乱的育儿室为戴米做了一只风筝。

“你只要付出本性中女性温柔的一半就行了，乔。你像一只毛栗子，有人得到你的话，就会发现，其实你仅仅外表带刺，但内心柔软甜蜜。总有一天，你的真心会随着爱情而表白，然后，粗糙的外壳也就脱落了。”

“太太，霜冻可以打开栗子的壳，但得使劲抖动才能掉下来。男孩子爱去拾栗子，但我不喜欢他们把我装进口袋。”乔一边答道，一边拼命甩风筝，但普通的风不可能托起风筝，因为，戴茜已经把自己粘在了上面当尾巴。

美格笑了，欣慰地看着乔流露出一星半点往日的神态，但她觉得有义务通过已经掌握的每一个论据加强自己的观点。姐妹间的闲聊也不浪费，尤其是谈孩子的事，这是美格两个最有效论据，乔非常喜欢他们。悲伤是打开某些人内心世界大门最有效的钥匙。乔基本上准备好装进口袋了。这时候，栗子的成熟就差一点儿阳光了，但不需要男孩急不可耐地去抖动，只要一个男人伸出手，轻轻地拨开栗壳，就能发现结实而香甜的栗心了。如果她猜测到这一点，就会紧紧地自我封闭，比以前更加带刺了，幸亏她没有在想自己，所以，后来就水到渠成，瓜熟蒂落了。

假如乔是道德说教故事中的女主角，那么，她在这个年龄就应该过着相当圣洁的生活了，她会与世隔绝，戴着帽子，一副苦行的模样，口袋里放着教会的册子，四处行善积德。但是，你知道，乔可不是这种主角。她不过就是成千上万像她一样在生活中不甘于命运的一个姑娘而已。她仅仅在按照自己的本性行动，就如同情绪所反映的那样，有时候伤感烦恼，有时候无精打采，当然，有时候也会浑身是劲。从道德规范来说，我们要学好，但是，这不可能一蹴而就，而是需要漫长的磨练，奋力的修炼，大家一起做，然后一部分人才能踏上正轨。乔已经达到了这一步，试图干好自己的分内事，一旦没有做到，就会闷闷不乐；而要开开心心地去做——啊，那当然是另外一回事了！她经常说，要干一些了不起事情，无论多么艰难困苦。现在，她实现了这个愿望，把自己的一生都献给父母亲，一心一意地让家庭充满欢乐，就跟他们曾经给自己带来欢快的日子一样。有什么事，能够比这种行为更加壮美感人呢？如果说，为了增加努力的辉煌程度，所碰到的各种困难都是必需的，那么，对于一个一刻都闲不住，具有自我抱负的姑娘来说，毅然放弃了自己的憧憬，人生的蓝图和七情六欲，开开心心地为了别人而活着，有什么能比这更加艰巨？

上帝成全了她的诺言。现在，任务就在眼前摆着，不是她所期盼的事情了，但这样反而更好，因为，里面没有自我的份额。她能够做到吗？她决定去尝试一下。最初，她就遇到了我所提到过的那种帮助。后来，又得到了一个帮助。然而，她接受帮助时，没有认为那是对她的一种回报，而是将其理解为对她的宽慰，就跟那攀登名叫“困难”的这座山的基督徒一样，有时候，也会躺在小树里休息一阵，得到身心的恢复。

“你为什么不写作了呢？过去，你写作时，总是很高兴。”有一次，失望的情绪笼罩了乔的时候，她母亲问道。

“我没有心思写作，就是写好了，也没有人爱看。”

“我们爱看的。给我们写一些吧，别去管人家。乖乖，可以尝试一下嘛。我敢肯定，对你会有好处的，我们也会觉得很愉快的。”

“别以为我还能写作了。”不过乔拉开书桌，开始整理写了一半的手稿了。

一个小时之后，母亲往这边张望了一眼，见她还在里面，围着一条黑色的围裙，全神贯注，伏案疾书，不禁笑着赶紧走开了，对自己的成功建议颇感得意。乔一直都莫名其妙，只知道小说里面溜进了什么东西，它直接打动了读者的心。家里人跟着故事内容，时而大笑，时而流泪。接着，父亲不顾她的反对，把小说寄给了一家通俗杂志。令乔感到震惊的是，她不但收到了稿酬，还收到了求稿信。小小说登出来以后，几位读者来信，都赞不绝口，给了乔很大的荣誉。不久，报纸也纷纷转载，无论是朋友，还是陌生的读者，都非常欣赏这篇。当然，仅就这件小东西，她的成功是很大的。乔比当初她的长篇小说同时遭到褒贬时，还要大吃一惊。

“我真不理解。一篇小小说有什么值得这样赞扬的？”乔十分困惑地问道。

“里面说的是实话，乔，这就是奥秘。幽默加上煽情，使故事活灵活现，你最终也找到了自己的风格。还有，你写作时丝毫没有考虑名利，而是全身心地投入创作。女儿啊，你可是苦尽甘来呀。想想办法吧，跟我们一样，为你的成功而欢欣鼓舞吧。”

“如果我写的东西含有善和真的成分，那其实不是我的创作，完全都归功于你和母亲，还有贝丝。”乔说，使她深受感动的不是外界的任何赞扬，而是父亲的谆谆话语。

乔受到了爱和悲的熏陶，所以，写出了自己的一篇篇小说。她将这些小说投寄出去，使自己结交了一大批朋友她发现这是给那些卑微的漂泊者找到了一片慈善的天地。它们在那里受到善意的欢迎，也给家中的母亲带来了令人舒坦的纪念品，就跟孝子贤孙突然交上了好运一样。

艾美和劳里来信提及两人订婚时，马奇太太担心乔难以为此欢天喜地，但不久她就放宽心了。尽管乔起初看上去很沉闷，但仍然平静地接受了。乔对那两个孩子寄予了很大的希望，她接着又读了一通信。信是以二重奏形式写的，双方都充满爱意地夸奖对方，读起来很舒服，琢磨一下也让人觉得满意，没有人表示反对。

“妈妈，你喜欢这样？”乔问道。她们将写满字的信纸放下，相互对视着。

“是啊，自从艾美信里说拒绝了弗雷德求婚之后，我就希望事情会如愿以偿。我当初确信，她灵机一动，之后肯定会比你所谓的‘唯利是图精神’更加高尚的。而且，她信中经常闪烁其词，更加让我怀疑爱情和劳里会占上风的。”

“妈咪，你真厉害，而且真缄默！你对我一直只字未提。”

“当母亲的就需要眼明嘴紧，她们需要管好女儿。我当时有点不敢把这想法告诉你，生怕你事情没定下来就给写信祝贺。”

“我可不会跟从前那么沉不住气。可以相信我。现在我非常冷静懂事，谁都可以推心置腹的。”

“可不是吗，乖乖，我早就应该跟你推心置腹了。只不过我心想，知道你的特迪爱上了别人，你会痛苦的。”

“哎，妈妈，当初爱情尽管不成熟，却非常新鲜，我还是拒绝了他，事到如今，你真的以为我那么愚蠢，那么自私吗？”

“我知道当时你是真心真意，乔，不过，最近我认为，如果特迪回家再次求婚，你或许会喜欢换个答复的。乖乖，请原谅，我不由自主地看到你孤苦一人，有时候，你那种饥渴眼神直刺我的心啊。所以，我想你的小伙子如果现在恳求的话，就有可能乘虚而入，填补你的感情空白嘛。”

“不，妈妈，现在这样还是最好。艾美已经开始爱上他，我很高兴。但有一件事，你是对的。我确实孤独，也许，假如特迪再次求婚，我有可能说‘行啊’。这倒不是因为我还是喜欢他，而是因为跟他离开时相比，我更加在乎有人爱了。”

“这样我真高兴，这说明你在进步。爱你的人多着呢，所以，现在你就安心守着爸爸妈妈、兄弟姐妹、朋友孩子们吧，就等着最佳爱人的回报吧。”

“母亲是世界上最好的爱人，但我不会介意悄悄跟妈咪讲，我什么都想试试。奇怪的是，越尝试各种各样的人间真情，让自己满足，就越感到匮乏。真不明白，人心竟然能够装进这么多东西。我的心就很有弹性，永远不显得满足，而在过去，跟一家人在一起，就心满意足了。真不明白。”

“我明白的。”马奇太太睿智地笑了。乔则翻过几页信，开始回顾艾美对劳里的看法。

“得到爱，像劳里那样爱我，是一件很美满的事。这人看上去并不多情。对于这种事，他谈得不多，但从他的一言一行中，还是觉察到了，这让我感到很幸福，也感到很卑贱，觉得自己似乎不是原先的我了。直到现在，我才了解到他是多么好心，多么大度，多么温柔，他把心都亮给我了，让我看到他的高尚情操、美好理想和各种打算。得知这些都属于自己时，我觉得自豪极了。他告诉我，他好像觉得‘现在就能开始进行一次前途似锦的远航了，有我在轮船上当大副[1]，还有无限爱心充当压舱物’。我在祈祷，他会心想事成的，并且不辜负他对我的一切期望，而我一心一意、尽心尽责地爱慕这位勇猛的船长，绝不会离开他，愿上帝保佑我们天长地久。噢，妈妈，我从来没有想过，人彼此相爱，为对方活着时，这个世界便可以成为一个无比美丽的天堂！”

“瞧瞧，这位就是我们冷静、矜持、世俗的艾美哟！爱情是可以创造奇迹的，千真万确的。他俩该多么恩爱幸福啊！”说罢，乔小心翼翼地理好那几张哗哗作响的信纸，仿佛合上一本催人泪下的爱情故事书似的，因为故事紧紧地吸引读者，直到结局出现，才让读者孤零零地回到俗务缠人的世界上。

乔慢悠悠地走上楼，天下着雨，不能出去散步。她一时觉得坐立不安，往日的感觉又回来了，没有以前那么愤懑，但她仍然伤心而无怨地纳闷着，为什么一个姐妹要什么有什么，而另一个却一无所有。她知道，这种看法并不对，尽量不去考虑。然而，渴望亲情是人之常情，非常旺盛，再说，艾美的幸福也唤醒了她内心如饥似渴的欲望，希望“可以一心一意地爱某人，依附他，愿上帝保佑两人天长地久。”

心神不宁的漂泊结束了，乔站在阁楼里，身边有四只小木板箱并排放着，箱子上都刻着主人的名字，里面放满了统统一去不复返的童年时代和少女时期用过的物品。乔往箱内看了一眼，看见自己用过的那只箱子时，不禁将下巴靠在箱子边上，神色木然地凝视着杂乱的收藏。忽然，她看见一捆旧练习本。于是，就拿了出来，翻开几本，重温自己在好心的柯克太太家中度过的愉快冬天。起初，乔在笑，后来，神情专注，若有所思，接着，就满脸哀伤了。她看见了一张教授当年的亲笔字条，嘴唇开始颤抖了，膝上的本子纷纷落地。她坐了下来，开始端详那亲切的字字句句，仿佛现在都具有一层新的含义，触动了她的心弦。

“朋友，请等着我。也许有点迟到，但我一定会来的。”

“噢，但愿他会来！亲爱的老哥弗里茨，总是对我那么和蔼可亲，那么心诚意切，那么心平气和。在他身边时，我对他的珍惜根本不够，可是现在，我多么想见他呀，因为似乎大家都在疏远我，我真是孤家寡人了。”

乔紧紧攥着那张纸条，好像那是一纸待履行的承诺书。接着，她把头靠在一只舒适的碎布袋子上，失声痛哭，似乎在跟敲打着屋顶的雨点唱对台戏。

这一切是自怜，孤独，抑或情绪低落？也许是某份感情的苏醒，它始终像激起涟漪的对方一样在耐心等待。可是，谁能说得清呢？

第四十三章　惊喜不断


黄昏中，乔独自一个人躺在旧沙发上，盯着炉火，陷入了沉思。她最喜欢这样度过傍晚时分的。没人打搅，她喜欢躺在贝丝的红色小枕头上，构思小说，做梦，有时也满怀深情地想念妹妹，仿佛妹妹就在附近。她显得神情憔悴，神色黯然，非常悲伤。明天就是生日，她正在感叹时光如梭。一晃几年过去了，她渐渐变老，可似乎一无所成。就快满二十五岁了，可她却没什么值得炫耀的。乔这么想是错了，慢慢地她发现其实有很多东西可以炫耀，并对此感激不尽。

“我就要成为老姑娘了。一个喜欢文学的老处女，以笔为夫婿，以小说当孩子，也许二十年之后会小有名气，像可怜的约翰逊那样。但我老了时，不能享受名气之乐了，仍然会感到孤单。没人可以分享快乐，已不求人，也用不着名气了。哎呀，我不必去做乖戾的圣徒，或者只顾自己的罪人。我敢说，老姑娘们习惯了独身生活，会心安理得的，可是——”想到此，乔叹了口气，仿佛前景并不诱人。

首先，这前景是难以诱人的。二十五岁的人，到了三十岁便万事休矣。然而，事情并不是看上去那样糟。如果自身有了什么靠山，便能过得相当幸福。到了二十五岁，姑娘们便开始谈起做老姑娘了，但却暗下决心，绝不做老姑娘。上了三十，她们便不再提及此事，而是默默地接受事实。如果有见识，就会想到，还有二十多年有用的幸福时光，可以学会优雅地度过老年生活，聊以自慰。亲爱的姑娘们，别去笑话那些老处女。因为，朴素衣裙下默默翕动的心里，往往隐藏着非常温柔的苦恋罗曼史，而由于默默地牺牲掉青春、健康、抱负，乃至爱情本身，失色的芳容却在上帝眼里臻于美丽了。即便是悲哀、乖戾的姐妹们，也应加以善待，不为别的理由，就为了她们错过了人生最甜蜜的一段。妙龄姑娘应该同情她们，不应鄙视她们。应该记住，自己也可能会错过花好月圆的时光，红颜易老，秀发生银丝，假以时日，善意与敬老的礼遇，将和现在的爱情与仰慕同样甜蜜。

先生们，我是说男孩子们，对老姑娘们礼貌一点吧，别管她们多贫穷、多难看、多古板。因为，唯一值得拥有的骑士精神，便是随时敬老扶弱，服务妇女。别管她们的地位、年龄及肤色，回想一下那些好阿姨就行。她们不仅教训人，一惊一乍，而且也照顾、宠爱人，况且往往出力不讨好。想想看，她们帮你们排忧解困，从并不多的积蓄中拿出一部分给你们做零用，她们手指衰老，却不厌其烦为你们缝缝补补。想想她们心甘情愿迈动老迈的双脚为你们奔忙吧，知恩图报地给那些可亲的老太太们献上一点点的殷勤吧，只要她们还活着，就喜欢别人献殷勤的。心明眼亮的姑娘很快就会看出这种品格，并会因此而更喜爱你们。唯一能分开母与子的力量也就是死亡罢了，假如死亡夺去了母亲，你们肯定会在某个普里西拉阿姨[1]那里得到亲切的欢迎和慈母的爱抚，因为在她孤寂的老龄心坎里，始终为“世上最好的外甥”保留着最温暖的一角。

乔肯定睡着了（我敢说，读者对于刚才的小小说教，只能打瞌睡了），因为突然劳里的幽灵好像站了在她面前——一个很逼真、实实在在的幽灵——弯腰看着她，那种表情就像他以前感慨万千，可又不愿表现出来时一样。不过，就像情歌中的珍妮：





她万万没料到是他。





她躺着，抬头望着他，惊讶得说不出话来。他弯下腰亲吻她，她这才看清是他，跳了起来，高兴地叫道：

“我的特迪呀！我的特迪呀！”

“亲爱的乔，见到我很高兴，是吧？”

“很高兴！福气的男孩！太高兴了，不知道该说什么好。艾美在哪里？”

“你妈妈把她留在了美格家里。来的路上，我们在那里停了一下。她们抓住我的妻子，我也没办法。”

“你的什么人？”乔喊道。劳里不经意间得意地说出了两个字，泄露了秘密。

“哎呀！坏了！这下闯祸了！”他显得非常内疚，乔马上冲着他发火了。

“你居然结婚了！”

“是的，请原谅！可我永远都不会再干了。”他跪下，紧握双手，一副悔恨的样子，满脸淘气、高兴和胜利的神情。

“真的结婚了？”

“差不多啦，谢谢。”

“天哪！下面你还会做出什么可怕的事？”乔哀叹着瘫倒在椅子上。

“你的祝福有特点，可就是不太客气。”劳里答道，还是一副可怜巴巴的样子，可脸上满意地笑了。

“你像个贼，偷偷地溜进来，又那样就露了馅，你吓着人家了。你还想怎么样？起来，你这怪小子，把事情都跟我说说。”

“一个字都不说，除非让我坐到老地方，答应不设障碍。”

乔听了大笑起来，她已经很久没这么笑了。她一边拍拍沙发邀请他坐下，一边诚恳地说：“旧枕头在阁楼上，现在我们不需要了。好了，来吧，快坦白，特迪。”

“听你叫‘特迪’真顺耳！除了你，没人那么叫我。”劳里极满意地坐下。

“艾美怎么叫你？”

“老爷。”

“像是她叫的。还好，你也蛮像的。”从乔的眼神可以清楚地看到，她发现她的男孩更英俊了。

枕头没了，可还是有一个障碍——一个天然的障碍，由时间、分离和心的变化所造成的隔阂。他们俩都意识到了，面面相觑了片刻，似乎这个无形的障碍给他们笼罩了一层阴影。可很快这层阴影就消失了。劳里试图摆出一副架子，可没用。他说：

“难道我不像一个结了婚的人，不像一家之主？”

“一点都不像，你永远都不会像。个子长大了，人也长漂亮了，可你和以前一样是个调皮鬼。”

“行了，真的，乔，应该对我尊重些。”劳里回答，可心里却对一切很受用。

“我怎么也做不到，一想到你结婚、成家，忍不住要笑，我严肃不了！”乔答道。她满脸笑容，引得两人都不由得哈哈大笑起来。接着，他们坐下来畅谈，气氛仍像以前一样令人愉快。

“你没必要大冷天出去接艾美，她们马上就过来的。我等不及了，早就想亲口告诉你这个大大的惊喜。我要抢到第一块，以前抢吃奶油的时候，不是这么说的吗？”

“你当然抢到了啦，你的故事开头就颠倒，结果毁了全局。好了，拨乱反正，告诉我怎么回事，我太想知道了。”

“好吧，我这么做是为了让艾美高兴。”劳里说着眨眨眼，弄得乔大声喊道：

“天大的胡扯。艾美这么做是为了让你高兴。行的话，说下去，说实话，先生。”

“哎呀，她开始用小姐的口气说话了。难道听她说话不是很开心？”劳里对着炉火说。熊熊燃烧的炉火闪闪发光，似乎表示赞成。“都一样，要知道，她和我都成了一体。一个多月前，我们本来打算和卡罗尔一家一起回来，可她们突然变卦，决定在巴黎再待个冬天。可爷爷想回家，他去就是为了让我开心，我不能让他独自回来，可又不能丢下艾美。卡罗尔太太有些英国人的观念，小姐需要有监护人之类的无聊东西，不肯让艾美跟我们一起回国。我说：‘让我们结婚吧，那样就可以随心所欲了。’就把问题解决了。”

“你当然行，总是那么顺。”

“也不一定。”劳里的话有弦外之音，乔听了，赶紧说：

“你们怎么让婶婶答应的？”

“真的很难。可别说出去，我们有很多理由，终于说服了她。来不及写信征得你们的同意，但我想你们会高兴的，而且早就慢慢答应了。像我妻子说的那样，只是‘抓住时间的后腿嘛’。”

“难道我们不为那些话感到自豪吗？难道我们不喜欢这样说吗？”乔插话说，这回轮到她对着炉火说。她高兴地注视着，看到他的双眼中仿佛点燃了幸福的火花，而她上次看到的却是一双忧郁悲伤的眼睛。

“也许只是小事一桩。她这个小妇人非常迷人，我不由得为她感到自豪。接着，有婶婶夫妻俩当监护人，而我们两个深深相爱，不在一起，根本就不行的。这种绝妙的安排使各方面都变得很容易，所以我们就结婚了。”

“什么时候？什么地点？怎么结？”乔问，女儿家的狂热好奇心被唤起了，而她自己根本就没有意识到。

“六个礼拜前，在美国驻巴黎领事馆。当然婚礼很安静，因为我们在幸福的时候，也没忘记亲爱的小贝丝。”

说着，劳里握住了乔伸过来的手，轻轻地抚平红色的小枕头，他对它记忆犹新的。

他们默默地坐了片刻。“事后为什么不告诉我们呢？”乔问道，声音更轻了。

“本来想给你们一个惊喜的。原先想直接回家，可等我们一结婚，这位亲爱的老先生觉得，他至少得一个月才能准备好。他就让我们去度蜜月，到哪里随我们的便。艾美说过，玫瑰谷确是个度蜜月的好地方，我们就去了那里。我们过得非常幸福，毕竟一生只有一次。没错，爱情不就在玫瑰花丛中！”

劳里一时似乎忘掉了乔。乔感到很高兴，这样随便、自然地跟她讲这些，使她确信他已然不念旧恶了。她试图抽出手来，但他好像猜到了该模糊不自觉冲动背后的想法，反而握紧了她的手。他带着她不曾见过的男子汉的严肃神情说道：

“乔，乖乖，我想说件事，然后我们就把它永远丢开吧。我曾经写信提到，艾美一直对我很好，正如信中所说的，我绝不会停止对你的爱。但那种爱已经变了，我已经懂得了随遇而安。艾美和你在我心中变换了位置，就这么回事。我想，事情本来就是这样安排的，假如我按照你的话耐心去等待，这件事也会水到渠成的。可是我根本捺不下性子，所以得了心疼病。那时我是个孩子，固执狂暴，需要经过硬邦邦的教训我才能认识到那错误。乔，正如你说的，那确是个错误。我当了回傻瓜，才明白这一点。信我的话，有一段时间我脑子里乱糟糟的，不清楚自己最爱的是谁，是你还是艾美，我试图两人都爱，但做不到。在瑞士见到艾美时，一切似乎立刻明朗了。当你俩各就各位时，我确信，旧爱完全消失了，这才开始了新欢。因此，我能够诚实地与乔妹妹及妻子艾美交心，同时深深地爱着两人。你愿意相信吗？愿意回到我们初识时那段幸福的时光吗？”

“我愿意相信，没有半点保留。但是，特迪，我们再也不是男孩女孩了。昔日的好日子不可能重来，我们不能这样企盼。现在我们是男人和女人，有正经的事情要做。游戏时期已经结束，必须停止嬉闹了。我相信你也感到了这一点。我在你身上看到了变化，你也会在我身上看到的。我会怀念我的小伙子，但会同样爱那个男人，更加赞赏他，因为他打算做我希望他做的人。我们不可能再当小玩伴了，但会成为兄弟姐妹的，一辈子都会互爱互助，对不对，劳里？”

他没有开口，却握住了伸过来的手，将脸贴在上面放了一会儿。他感到，从孩子气激情的坟墓中，升腾起一种美丽的牢不可破的友情，给两人带来福气。乔不愿使亲人回国变成不快的事，过了一会儿，她便愉快地说：“我还是不能确信，两个孩子真的结了婚，要开始居家过日子了。哎呀，我替艾美扣围裙扣子，你开玩笑时我拽你的头发，好像还是昨天的事。天哪，时间过得真快！”

“两个孩子中有一个比你大呢，不用说话像奶奶那样。我自诩已经是个‘长大的先生’，像佩格蒂说大卫·科波菲尔[2]的那样。看到艾美时，你会发现她是个相当早熟的孩子。”劳里说。他看着她那副母亲的神气感到好笑。

“你岁数可能比我大一点，可是我感情上比你老成得多，特迪。女人总是这样的。而且这一年过得那样艰难，我感到自己都奔四了呢。”

“可怜的乔！我们丢下你，让你独自承受，而自己却在玩乐。你是老了些。这里有条皱纹，那里还有一条。除了笑时，你的眼神都透着悲哀。刚才我摸过枕头，发现上面有泪滴。你承受了那么多，而且不得不独自忍受。我是个多么自私的家伙！”劳里面带悔恨，拽着自己的头发。

然而，乔只是把那泄露秘密的枕头翻过去，尽量轻松愉快地答道：“不对，我有爸妈帮我，有可爱的婴孩安慰我，还想到你和艾美安全、幸福，这些都使这里的麻烦容易忍受些了。有的时候，我是感到孤独，可是，我敢说那对我有好处，而且——”

“你再也不会孤独了。”劳里打断她。他用胳膊拢住她，仿佛要挡住人间的一切不幸。“我和艾美没有你没法生活的，所以你必须来教‘两个孩子’管家，就像以前那样，凡事均对半分。让我们爱你，大家在一起幸福美满，友好相处。”

“假如我不碍事的话，那敢情好了。我又开始感到年轻了，你一来我所有的麻烦似乎都飞走了。你总是让人感到安慰，特迪。”乔将头靠到了劳里的肩上，就像几年前贝丝生病躺在那里，劳里让她抓住他那样。

他低头看看她，想知道她是否还记得那个时候。但是乔顾自笑着，仿佛他的到来真的使麻烦全都消失了。

“你还是那个乔，一下掉泪，一下笑的。现在你看着有点顽皮，想什么呢，奶奶？”

“我在想你和艾美在一起过得怎样。”

“过得像天使一样快乐！”

“那当然。开始是这样，可是谁说了算呢？”

“我不介意告诉你，现在是她说了算，至少我让她这么认为——你看，这样她高兴。将来我们会轮流的。据说，婚姻中均分权力会使责任加倍。”

“你会一发而不可收拾的，艾美会一辈子统治你的。”

“咳，她做得那样不知不觉，我想我不会太在乎的。她这种妇人知道如何统治好男人的。事实上，我倒挺喜欢那样。她就像绕一束丝绸一般，轻柔漂亮地将你绕在她手指上，左右你，却使你感到仿佛她始终在给你帮忙。”

“居然让我看到你成为妻管炎的丈夫，真惬意！”乔举起双手叫道。

只见他挺起肩膀，带着男子汉的蔑视神情对那讥讽一笑置之。他“神气活现”地回答：“艾美有教养，不会那样做的，我也不是那种屈从的人。我们互相尊重，不会强横霸道，也不会争吵的。”

乔喜欢这样，认为新出现的尊严很适宜。不过，那男孩仿佛很快在长大成人，使她快乐之中夹杂着遗憾。

“那肯定。你和艾美从来不像我们俩那样争吵。她是那寓言故事里的太阳，我是风。记得吗？太阳对付男人最灵。”

“她既能让他屈服，也能照耀他。”劳里笑了，“我在尼斯受了什么样的训话啊！我保证，那比你任何一次责骂都厉害得多——刺激可大了。改日我来告诉你——她绝不会告诉你的，因为她告诉我，说她看不起我，为我感到羞耻。话刚说完，她便爱上了那卑鄙的家伙，并嫁给了那个窝囊废。”

“那么下贱啊！好吧，假如她骂你，找我好了，我来保你。”

“看来我需要有人来保的，是不是？”劳里说着站起来摆出架子，这时，传来了艾美的声音：“她在哪里？我亲爱的乔在哪里？”劳里的威严神态旋即转为狂喜了。

全家人列队进入，大家又都拥抱、亲吻了一遍。好不容易，三个漂泊者最后坐定，让大家都看着他们，表达高兴。劳伦斯先生还是那么精神矍铄，和另外两人一样，出国旅行改善了他的精神面貌，固执的脾气似乎也一扫而光，他那传统的礼节也得到了提升，显得更加和蔼可亲。他叫这对新人“我的孩子们”。他对他们的笑真叫怡人。更妙的是，艾美待老人像女儿一样孝顺亲热，使老人心满意足。最妙的是，劳里围着他团团转，欣赏着这一老一少组成的美景，好像永远都看不够。

美格的目光一落到艾美身上，便意识到自己的服装没有巴黎人的风味。小劳伦斯太太会使小莫法特太太都黯然失色的，那位女士可是个地地道道、非常优雅有风度的妇人。乔观察着这对新人，想着：“他俩在一起看着多么般配啊！我做对了，劳里找到了美丽、出色的女孩。她比笨拙的老乔更适合他的家庭，她会成为他的骄傲，而不是他的烦恼。”马奇太太和丈夫面露喜色，他们相互点头微笑着。他们看到小女儿做得很好，不仅待人接物入情入理，而且也得到了爱情、自信、幸福这些更好的财富。

艾美的脸庞柔和文静，神采奕奕，显示出内心的宁静。她的声音里新添了一种柔情，冷漠拘谨的仪表变成了文雅端庄、妩媚动人。小巧的装饰并没有影响她整体的气质，热诚美好的举止，显得比以前的优雅或者新婚的美貌更为迷人，因为它立刻明白无误地使她印上了一个真正的淑女标记，以前她多么希望这样啊。

“爱情使我们的小女儿变了许多。”妈妈和蔼地说。

“她一生都有个好榜样，亲爱的。”马奇先生低声回答，他深情地看了一眼身旁那张神情憔悴的脸和头发灰白的头。

戴茜的眼睛离不开她的“漂良（亮）阿姨”，于是就像巴儿狗似的把自己系在了那充满了诱惑的神奇女主人身上。戴米先是顾盼着，怔怔地考虑这新出现的关系，后来便性急地接受了贿赂，归降了。诱人的贿赂是从伯尔尼带来的一组木熊玩具。然而，一阵侧翼包抄迫使他无条件地就范了，因为劳里知道怎样对付他。

“小伙子，第一次有幸认识你时，就打我的脸。现在我要求绅士般的决斗。”说着，高个子姨父便着手将小外甥抛着、揉着，那动作既破坏了他雅士的尊严，也逗乐了他孩子般的内心。

“哎呀，她从头到脚穿着丝绸！你看她坐在那儿神采扬扬（飞扬），听大家管小艾美叫劳伦斯太太，真有趣的场面！”老汉娜咕哝着。她一边在绝对胡乱地摆着桌子，一边忍不住频频透过滑门朝里张望。

天哪，瞧他们是怎么说话的！你一言，我一语，接着大家一起七嘴八舌起来，都想在半个钟头内把三年的事情讲完。幸好茶点准备好了，为大家提供了喘息机会，叫做茶歇。再那样说下去，他们都会嗓子沙哑，头昏眼花的。一队人马鱼贯进入了小餐厅，真是非常愉快的队列！马奇先生自豪地护送着劳伦斯太太，马奇太太则同样骄傲地依在新女婿的臂上。老先生对乔耳语道：“现在你得当我女儿了。”他拉着她的手，瞥了一眼炉火边那个空角落，乔双唇颤抖着低声回答：“我会尽量填补她的位置的，先生。”

那对双胞胎在后面欢跳着。他们感到千禧年就在眼前，因为大家都忙着应酬新来的人，丢下他俩任意狂欢。可以确信的是，机会难得，他们不会错过。君不见，他们偷偷呷了几口茶，随意把姜饼装进嘴巴，每人拿了一个热松饼。登峰造极的是，他们每人往小口袋里塞了一个诱人的果酱馅饼，结果馅饼粘在那里，捣乱地变成了碎屑，这开导了他们，原来人性和馅饼都很脆弱。他们兜里藏着馅饼，心中不安，担心乔乔姨锐利的眼睛会穿透那薄薄的麻纱布衣和美利奴绒线衣，里面可隐藏着赃物。所以，小罪人们紧贴着没有戴眼镜的“外东（公）”。艾美刚才像点心似的被大伙儿传来传去，这时靠着劳伦斯爸爸的肩臂，回到客厅，其余的人像方才进去一样捉对出来了。这样一来只剩下乔没了伴儿。当时她没在意，因为她滞留在餐厅，回答着汉娜急切的询问。

“艾美小姐要坐那四轱辘马车吗？要用那边储藏的漂亮银盘子吃饭吗？”

“要是她驾着六匹白马，天天用金盘子吃饭，戴钻石戒指，穿针绣花边衣，也不奇怪。特迪认为怎么善待她都不过分。”乔心满意足地回答。

“那我无题可问！你早饭吃杂烩还是鱼丸子？”汉娜问。她巧妙地将诗歌和散文混在了讲话里。

“我随便。”乔关上了门。她感到此时食物是个不投机的话题。乔站了片刻，看着那群人上楼消失。随着戴米穿着格子呢裤子，迈着短腿，吃力地爬上最后一级楼梯，她心头突然涌上一股强烈的孤独感。她眼睛模糊了，环视四周，似乎要寻找可以依靠的东西，因为连特迪都离她而去了。如果她知道，随着时间一分分逝去，有件令她惊喜的生日礼物正在向她靠近，她就不会想：“等我上床后，再稍微哭一下。现在哭丧着脸还不行。”然后，她用手擦了一下眼睛——这是她的一个习惯，颇具男孩风格，从来都不知道手帕在哪里——她刚装出一副笑脸，大门上就传来敲门声。

她好客地急忙开门，不禁吓了一跳，仿佛又来了个幽灵，令她惊喜不已。门口站着一位先生，高个子，络腮胡，在黑暗中冲着她笑，俨然午夜的太阳。

“啊，巴尔先生。见到你真的高兴！”乔一把抓住他喊道，仿佛唯恐他还没被请进来，就被黑夜吞噬了。

“我来见马希小姐——不，你们有聚会——”听到楼上传来说话声和跳舞声，教授便停住了。

“不是的，都是家里人。我妹妹和几个朋友刚回国，我们都很高兴。进来吧，和我们一起玩。”

虽然是个爱交际的人，可我想巴尔先生还是会知趣地走开，改天再来。这时，乔躲在他身后关上了门，夺下他的帽子，他又怎么走呢？也许她的笑容起了特别的作用，见到他，乔忘了掩饰内心的喜悦，于是便坦率地表露。这对这位孤独的先生具有不可抵抗的诱惑力，欢迎仪式远远超出了他最大胆的想象。

“要是我不是‘多余先生’的话，倒很高兴见见大家。你生病了，朋友？”

他突然提出这个问题。乔替他挂衣服时，灯光照到她脸上，他注意到了些许变化。

“没有病，倒是累，还有点伤心。离开你以后，我们遇到了麻烦。”

“啊，是，我知道。听说那事，我很伤心！”他又和她握握手，一脸同情，从那双和蔼的眼睛和温暖大手的握力，乔感受到无比宽慰。

“爸爸，妈妈，这是我的朋友，巴尔教授。”她介绍说，神情和口吻里都有一种不可抑制的自豪和喜悦，不亚于吹着喇叭、载歌载舞地开门迎接。

陌生人若是对自己会受到的接待起先没有底，受到热忱迎接后，疑虑便烟消云散了。每个人都亲切地问候他，起先是看在乔的分上，可不久便喜欢上了他。她们不由自主，因为他身上的法宝，能让所有人都敞开心胸。这些淳朴的人立刻对他热情起来，因为他贫穷，她们反而感到更加友好。贫穷使生活小康的人们更加富有，是使他们真正表现出好客的万能钥匙。巴尔先生坐着，环顾四周，仿佛是一个旅行者敲开了陌生人家的大门，等门打开，却发现自己回到了家。孩子们围着他，就像蜜蜂围着蜜罐。两个孩子一条腿上坐一个，童年无忌，上去搜他的口袋，拔他的胡子，摆弄他的表，想引起他的注意。女人们互递眼色，表示赞许，马奇先生找到了知音，为他的客人打开了话匣子，述说他最精辟的话题。沉默寡言的约翰听着，欣赏这番谈话，只是一个字都没说。劳伦斯先生发现，要去睡觉是不可能的了。

要不是乔在忙着，她会被劳里的表现逗乐的。一阵轻微的刺痛，不是出于忌妒，而是出于些许怀疑，这位先生一时超然，带着兄长般的慎重观察新来者，但为时不长。后来他不由自主地产生了兴趣，不知不觉被吸引进那一圈人中。在这样亲切的氛围里，巴尔先生的口才充分发挥了出来。他极少对劳里说话，却常看他。他看着风华正茂的年轻人，脸上便会掠过一丝阴影，仿佛为自己失去的青春遗憾。然后，他的眼睛便会渴望地转向乔。假如乔看到了他的眼神，肯定会回答那无声的询问。可是乔得管住自己的双眼，觉得不能放任。她谨慎地让眼睛盯着正在织的小袜子，像是个模范的独身姑妈。

乔不时地偷看一眼，就像风尘仆仆赶路之后饮几口清水一样，这很提神，因为在侧面扫视中，几个吉兆露头了。第一，巴尔先生的脸上丢弃了心不在焉的表情，他精神抖擞，兴致勃勃。她认为，眼前的这位绅士还颇为年轻英俊呢。她忘了将他和劳里比较，对陌生人她通常这样做，这对他们大为不利。第二，巴尔似乎很有灵感，虽然谈话转到了古人的丧葬习俗。无论如何，这不能看做是令人兴奋的话题。当特迪在一场争论中被驳得哑口无言时，乔得意得脸上放光。她看着爸爸神情专注的脸，心里想道：“每天都有教授这样的谈友，该有多乐啊！”最后，巴尔先生穿着黑色新西服，这样一来，显得分外像绅士。浓密的头发剪了，梳理得很整齐，可好景不长，他一激动起来，便故态复萌，把它弄得滑稽不堪。比起平整的头发，乔更喜欢他头发乱竖着，她认为那样使他漂亮的额头带上了朱庇特[3]式的样子。可怜的乔，她是怎样赞美着那个其貌不扬的人哪！她坐在那儿，默默地织着袜子，但什么也没逃脱她的眼睛，她甚至注意到巴尔先生洁净的袖口上有着金光闪闪的扣子。

“亲爱的老兄！哪怕去求婚，他也不可能更精心地装扮自己了。”乔心里想着。这句话突然使她灵魂深处一闪念，她的脸陡然红了起来，只好将线团丢下，弯腰去拣，借机遮住脸。

然而，这个小动作并不像她预期的那样成功，因为，用比喻的说法，教授正在为火葬堆点火呢，见状放下了火把，躬身去捡那蓝色小线团。当然，他们两人的头猛地撞到了一起，撞得眼冒金星。两个人红着脸直起身来，大笑，都没有拾到线团。他们回到了各自的座位，心里后悔不该离座。

没有谁意识到夜已深了，汉娜早就巧妙地挪走了孩子。他们打着盹，就像两朵粉红的罂粟花。劳伦斯先生回家休息了。剩下的人围炉而坐，不停地谈着，完全不顾时间的流逝。后来，美格的母性脑袋里产生了坚定的信念：戴茜肯定摔到床下去了，戴米想必在研究着火柴的结构，睡衣定是被点着了。于是她动身回家了。

“歌得唱吧，就像以前那样，为我们的团聚。”乔说。她觉得，引吭高歌可以尽情而又稳妥地宣泄自己心中的喜悦之情。

其实，并不是人人都到齐了，可是没有谁觉得乔的话没头没脑，不正确。因为贝丝似乎还在他们中间，无形却无处不在。她甚至比以前更亲爱。爱使家庭同盟坚不可摧，死亡也不能将其拆散。那张小椅子放在老地方，整洁的工作篮还放在惯常的架子上，篮子里装着她因缝衣针“很重”而没完成的针线活，那张心爱的钢琴没有移动地方，现在很少有人去碰它。贝丝安详的笑脸就在钢琴上方，像以前那样，俯视着他们，仿佛在说：“快乐一点吧，我就在这里。”

“弹点什么吧，艾美。让大家听听你有了多大的长进。”劳里说。他对他有出息的学生满怀自豪，这情有可原。

可是艾美噙着热泪，转动着那张褪了色的琴凳，低声说：“今晚不弹了，亲爱的。今晚我不能炫耀。”

然而，她确实露了一手，这一手比才华或琴艺更好，她唱起贝丝常唱的歌来。声音里充满柔情，这是最好的老师也教不出来的。任何其他的灵感都不能赋予她更甜美的震撼力量，它打动了听者的心弦。唱到贝丝最喜欢的赞美诗中最后一句时，那清亮的歌声突然卡住了，屋子里非常安静。很难说出口：

“人世间没有天堂治愈不了的痛苦。”

艾美靠在站在她身后的丈夫身上，她感到没有贝丝的亲吻，她回国接风仪式便不完美。

“好了，我们以《米娘之歌》结束吧，巴尔先生会唱的。”没等艾美的停顿使人难受起来，乔赶紧说。巴尔先生喜悦地清清嗓子，哼了一声。他走到乔站着的角落说：

“你和我一起合唱好吗？我俩配合非常好。”

顺便说一句，这可是个可爱的谎话，因为，乔对音乐一窍不通，哪怕拉一只蚂蚱合唱也不过如此。但是，即便教授提议唱整个一出歌剧，乔也会同意的。她颤声唱了起来，喜悦中也不管是否合拍合调。这没多大关系，巴尔先生像个真正的德国人那样起劲地唱着，他唱得不错。很快，乔的声音便降为轻柔的低哼了，这样她便可以听着那似乎专为她唱的圆润歌声。





你知道那个香橼盛开的国家吗？





这曾经是教授最喜欢的一句歌词，因为那个国家对他来说，指的是德国。但是，现在他却似乎带着特别热情和旋律，拖长了下面的歌词：





那里，哦，那里，我愿和你一起，

我亲爱的，去吧。





这深情的邀请，使一个听众激动不已，她极想说，她真的知道那个国家，只要他愿意，她随时欣然前往。

歌唱得非常成功，演唱者载誉而退。可是，几分钟后，他瞪眼看着艾美戴上帽子，完全忘记了礼貌，因为乔只简单地介绍她为“自己的妹妹”。从他进屋起，没有谁叫她的新名字。后来他更加忘乎所以了，因为劳里在告别时，以他最优雅的风度说道：

“我和我妻子为见到你深感荣幸，先生。别忘了，我们随时欢迎你大驾光临。”

于是，教授由衷地向他致谢，满怀喜悦，神采飞扬。劳里认为教授是他见过的最令人愉快、感情外露的老兄。

“我也该走了。不过亲爱的太太，如果您允许的话，我会乐意再来的。我城里有点小事务，将在这里逗留几天。”

他对马奇太太说着话，眼睛却看着乔。妈妈的声音和女儿的眼色都真心诚意地表示同意。不像莫法特太太设想的那样，马奇太太并非不明白家里孩子们的心事。

“我觉得那人很聪明。”等客人们都走了，马奇先生站在炉火边的地毯上评论道。他平心静气，带着满足感。

“看得出来，他是个好人。”马奇太太一边给时钟上发条，一边赞许地补充道，显得很肯定。

“我早就觉得你们会喜欢他的。”乔就说了这一句，说完便溜走睡觉去了。

她感到奇怪，什么事让巴尔先生来到这个城里，最后断定他是被指派到某地担任某个要职，可他很谦虚，不愿说出真相。他回到了自己的房间，肯定没人看见了。他看着相片中的年轻小姐，头发浓密，神情严肃、古板，她仿佛忧郁地凝视着未来。她要是看到他这时的神色，特别是当他吹灯后，在黑暗中亲吻这张相片，她一切都会明白的。

第四十四章　金童玉女


“岳母大人，请将我妻子借我半小时行吗？行李到了，我急着找要用的东西，把艾美从巴黎带来的衣服珠宝翻得底朝天了。”第二天，劳里进来说。他发现劳伦斯太太坐在妈妈的膝上，好像又成了宝宝。

“当然行，去吧，乖乖。我忘了，除了这个家你还有个家。”马奇太太捏了捏那戴着结婚戒指的白皙的手，仿佛为她母性的贪爱道歉。

“我要是能解决，就不会过来了。可是，没有我的小妇人没法过，就像一个——”

“没有风的风向标。”劳里沉吟找比喻的时候，乔提示道。自打特迪回来，乔恢复了冲撞无礼的老样子。

“没错。大部分时间艾美让我向正西开，只是偶尔朝南，结婚以来我还没有朝过东，北面是一无所知。但是我觉得，这样对我大有益处，所以，我乐于听命。”

“目前为止天气不错，不知道能持续多久。可我不怕风暴，我正在尝试怎样在恶劣的气候下驾驶我的船。回家吧，亲爱的，我给你找脱靴器，想必你在我的东西里翻找的就是它。妈妈，真是拿男人们没办法。”艾美带着主妇似的神气说，丈夫乐了。

“你们安定下来后，打算做些什么呢？”乔问，她在给艾美扣着斗篷扣，就像以前为她扣围裙那样。

“我们自有计划。还不打算大事张扬，刚刚成家嘛。但不打算虚度时光。我将专心经商，爷爷一定高兴。要向他证明我没被惯坏。需要这样使自己稳定下来。我厌倦了无所事事，得像男子汉那样工作。”

“艾美呢？她打算做什么？”马奇太太问。劳里说话时的坚定与活力，使她非常高兴。

“我们向四邻尽过礼仪，展示过我们最好的帽子后，将在家里广筵宾客，让上流的社交界为之注目，给我们带来良好的社会声望，到时让你们大吃一惊。就这样，是不是，雷卡米耶夫人[1]? ”劳里诡秘地看着艾美问道。

“到时就知道的。走吧，你这莽汉。别当着家人的面骂我，让他们受不了。”艾美回答。她打定主意，家里先得有个好妻子，然后她才能做社交王后，建立一个沙龙。

“这两个孩子凑在一起看上去多幸福啊！”马奇先生说。小两口走后，他发现很难再专心于他的亚里士多德了。

“是的，我看能天长地久的。”马奇太太补充道。她神色安逸，就像领航员将船安全地引入了港湾。

“我知道一定会天长地久的，幸福的艾美！”乔叹了口气。然后，随着巴尔教授急躁地推门进屋，她欢快地笑了。

晚上，劳里对脱靴器放下心了。见艾美转来转去，在摆放着她的新艺术珍品，突然，劳里对妻子说：“劳伦斯太太。”

“老爷！”

“那个人打算娶我们的乔！”

“我希望这样，你呢，亲爱的？”

“嗯，宝贝，我看他是张王牌，包含那个富有表现力的词语的全部意义。但是我真的希望他稍稍年轻些，大大富有些。”

“哎唷，劳里，别太挑剔，太世俗了。只要他们相爱，不管多老多穷，都没一点儿关系。女人们绝不能为钱嫁人——”话一出口，艾美突然噎住了，她看着丈夫，而他故作严肃地搭腔了。

“当然不能，尽管有时确实能听到迷人的姑娘说打算这样做。要是我没记错，你曾经认为嫁个富人是你的责任。也许，这能说明你为什么嫁给我这样的窝囊废。”

“哦，我最亲爱的男孩。别，别那样说！当我说‘愿意’时，忘了你是有钱人。即使你一文不名，我也嫁你的。我有时希望你穷，好表示出我多么爱你。”艾美说。在公众场合她很庄重，私下却充满柔情。她令人信服地证实了她的话的真实。

“你没有当真以为我唯利是图，像我曾试着做的那样，是不是？要是你不相信我乐意与你同舟共济，哪怕你得靠在湖上划舟谋生，那我会伤心欲绝的。”

“我是个白痴野人吗？你拒绝了一个更富裕的人而嫁给我，现在我有权给你东西，可我想给你的你一半都不让给，我怎么能那么想呢？姑娘们每天都那样想，可怜的人们，她们被谆谆教导，认为那是唯一的归宿。你受到的课程较好，尽管我一度曾为你不寒而栗。我没有失望，女儿没辜负妈妈的教诲。昨天我跟妈这样说了，她显得又高兴又感激，仿佛给了她百万元的支票，让她用来行善。劳伦斯太太，你没有在听我的道德评论？”劳里住了口。艾美眼睛虽然盯着他的脸，表情却心不在焉。

“不，听着呢，同时我在欣赏你下巴上的凹陷。我不想使你虚荣，可是我得坦白，较之丈夫的钱财，我更为他的英俊自豪。别笑，你的鼻子对我是莫大的安慰。”艾美带着艺术的满足感，轻柔地抚摸着那个轮廓优美的面庞。

劳里一生受到过许多赞美，但没有比这更合心意的。虽然他笑话妻子这种特别的趣味，但还是喜形于色。艾美慢慢说道：“可以问个问题吗，亲爱的？”

“当然可以。”

“假如乔真的嫁给了巴尔先生，你会在乎吗？”

“噢，那是烦恼所在，是不？我想到了，那凹陷上有点东西不合你的意。我可不是占着茅坑不拉屎，而是世界上最幸福的男人。我向你保证，乔的婚礼上，我会带着和步态一样轻快的心情跳舞。宝贝，你相信吗？”

艾美抬头看着他，放心了。她最后的一点忌妒与担心烟消云散了。她感谢了他，神情充满爱意与自信。

“但愿我们能为那个一等一的教授做点什么。能不能编造出个富亲戚，他知趣地死在了德国，留给他一大笔遗产？”劳里问。这时他们手挽手，开始顺着长客厅来回踱步。他们喜欢这样，来纪念城堡花园。

“乔会查明真相，把一切搞砸的。教授现在这样，乔很为他自豪的。昨天她还说，她认为贫穷是件美事。”

“上帝保佑她的善心！要是她有个学者丈夫，还有十来个男女小教授要养活，就不会这样想了。现在别插手，见机行事吧。到时我们帮帮他们，就由不得他们了。我的教育一部分得归功于乔。她相信人们应该诚实地偿还债务，所以将用那种方法说服她。”

“能够帮助别人多愉快，是不是？有能力施恩于人是我的一个梦想。多亏你，梦想实现了。”

“我们大做善事，好不好？有一种穷人，我特别愿意帮。十足的乞丐得到了照顾，可是，有身份的穷人日子难过，因为他们不求人，人们也不敢贸然施舍。然而，帮助他们的办法比比皆是，只要人们知道用计，善于行善，就不致冒犯他们。我得说，我宁愿为落泊的绅士效劳，也不愿去帮巧言哄骗的叫花子。我想这样不对。但我就是这样想，虽然更难做。”

“因为只有绅士才能做到这一点。”家庭仰慕协会的另一名成员补充道。

“谢谢，恐怕配不上那溢美之词。我正想说呢，国外闲荡时，我看到许多才子，为了梦想做出各种牺牲，忍受着艰难困苦。其中一些非常杰出，他们像英雄一样工作，饥寒交迫，无亲无友，却充满勇气、耐心、意志。我为此惭愧，很想给予适当扶助。这些人帮助起来令人快活。若是天才，得以为他们效劳，不让天才由于缺乏燃料揭不开锅而被埋没或者耽搁，是个莫大的荣幸。假如他们不是天才，也能够安慰这些可怜的人，使他们发现自己无才时能免于绝望，这总归是件乐事。”

“的确是这样。还有一种人无法求助，在默默受苦。我知道的，在这之前，我也属于那种人。是你把我变成了公主，就像老故事里国王对乞丐女那样。劳里，有抱负的姑娘日子艰难哪。常常看着青春、健康以及宝贵的机会溜过去，只是缺少适时的小小帮助。人们一直对我非常好。每当看到姑娘像我们以前那样奋力挣扎，我就想伸手相帮，就像我得到帮助一样。”

“你就去做吧，你这样的像个天使！”劳里叫道。他脸上洋溢着乐善好施的热情，决心专门为有艺术倾向的女人们设立一个机构，并带头捐赠。“富人们无权坐在那里独自享乐，或者积财去让别人浪费。死后留下遗产，不如活着时明智地花钱，享受造福同胞的乐趣更聪明。我们将过得幸福，而慷慨解囊会额外增加我们的快乐。你愿意做个小多加[2]，一路行善，分光大篮子里的安慰，再装满善行吗？”

“我真心地愿意。愿你做勇敢的圣马丁[3]，骁勇闯天下，驻步让乞丐合穿你的外套。”

“成交，我们赚了！”

于是，这对新人握手达成协议，然后又幸福地继续踱起步来。他们希望能给别的家庭带来光明，所以感到温馨的小家越发亲切了。他们相信，要是为别人踏平了崎岖之路，则自己走在繁花似锦的小路上，双脚会走得更直。相爱的心使他们能温柔地记得不如他们幸运的人们，正是这份爱使他们俩的心贴得更紧了。

第四十五章　戴茜和戴米


作为马奇家卑微的家史作者，如果不奉献至少一个章节的篇幅给那两个最宝贝最重要的家庭成员，我会感到没有尽责。戴茜和戴米已经到了开窍的年龄，在这快节奏年代，三四岁的幼儿会坚持自己的权利，而且能如愿以偿，比许多大人都厉害。如果说曾经有一对双胞胎濒临被溺爱彻底宠坏的危险，那就是这两个牙牙学语的小布鲁克。当然他们是世上最出色孩子，有下面的事实为证。八个月的时候就会走路，十二个月就能流利地说话，两岁的时候，他们就在餐桌上有了席位，举止很得体，迷倒了所有的目睹者。三岁时，戴茜要做针线活，而且还真的缝出了一个有四道缝线的袋子。她还在餐具柜里干起了家务，娴熟地操纵起一个微型的炉灶，汉娜为之流出了骄傲的眼泪。戴米则跟外公学写字，外公发明了一种新的教学模式教字母，用手和脚形成字母，从而把头脑体操和脚跟体操结合了起来。这个男孩很早就显现了机械方面的天赋，这让他爸爸欣喜不已，却让他妈妈心烦意乱，因为他看到什么机械就去模仿，育儿室总是乱糟糟的。他的“缝纫七（机）”，是一个由绳子、椅子、晒衣夹和线轴组成的神秘结构，轮子就那么“转着转着”。还有，他在大椅子背后挂了一个篮子，把过于轻信的妹妹装在里面，往上拉，结果没成功。而这个有着女性献身精神的妹妹，居然听任自己的小脑袋被撞来撞去，直到获得解救。而这个小发明家却愤怒地说：“啊唷，妈——妈，大（那）是我的跳（吊）车，我想把她拉上来。”

这对双胞胎虽然性格迥然不同，但相处得非常好，很少有一天吵架超过三次的。当然戴米对戴茜专横跋扈，但总是勇敢地保护她免受其他人的侵犯。而戴茜则把自己变成了划船奴，她崇拜哥哥，认为他是世界上唯一的完人。她脸色红润、身体圆胖，有一颗阳光灿烂的小心灵。她很讨人喜欢，并且在每个人的心坎里安顿下来。她是那类生来就惹人去亲吻、去拥抱的迷人孩子，像个小仙女那样地被打扮着，被爱慕着，似乎生就是各种喜庆场合上的赞许对象。她的小美德很可爱，要不是活泼的天性中有点小淘气，她会是个十足的小天使。她的世界里都是晴空万里，每天早晨穿着小睡衣，爬上窗台观察，不管是下雨还是晴天，她总是说：“哦，和（好）天气，哦，和（好）天气！”在她眼里每个人都是朋友，她会很信任地去亲一个陌生人，连最乖僻的单身汉都会变得温和起来，喜欢孩子的人更是羡慕不已。

“囡囡爱每格（个）人。”有一次她这么说着，一手拿着勺子，一手拿着杯子，张开双臂，仿佛渴望着去拥抱和润泽整个世界。

看着她慢慢长大，她母亲开始感到，斑鸠房有幸居住了这么个安详又可爱的人儿，就像老房子曾经居住着一个让家人感到温暖的人儿一样，她祈祷自己免受类似的损失，这种损失最近让大家领悟了，他们长期以来不知不觉拥有着一个天使。外公经常叫她“贝丝”，外婆总是不知疲倦地看护着她，仿佛在设法弥补以往的某种过失，这个过失除了她自己没有人能看到。

戴米像个真正的美国佬，有追根究底的癖好，什么都想知道，老是问“为什么”，并经常为得不到满意的答复而恼火。

他也有哲学的爱好，这一点叫外公喜出望外，外公跟他进行苏格拉底式的交谈，早熟的学生偶尔还会难倒老师，而一旁的女眷们毫不掩饰得意的神情。

“是什么让我的腿走路，外东（公）? ”一天晚上被哄上床后，小哲学家问，若有所思地打量着自己那两条活动着的腿。

“是你的小脑袋，戴米。”圣人回答说，谦恭地抚摸着那满头金发的脑袋。

“什么是小脑太（袋）? ”

“它是某种指挥你身体行动的东西，就像手表里的发条使齿轮转动，我给你看过的。”

“帮我打开，我要看看它的转动。”

“你打不开手表，我打不开你的脑袋。上帝给你上了发条，你一直走着，直到有一天要你停下来。”

“是吗？”戴米汲取着新思想，棕色的眼睛瞪得又大又亮，“我像表一样上了发条？”

“是的，但是无法向你说明是如何上，因为上的时候我们没看到。”

戴米摸摸后背，仿佛要看看背部像不像手表，然后严肃地评论说：“我擦（猜），长（上）帝是在我睡觉的时候给我上的。”

接下来是外公仔细的解释，小家伙全神贯注地听着。一旁的外婆担忧地说：“亲爱的，你认为对孩子讲这些事情明智吗？他的额头上出现了隆起，会问出最难回答的问题的。”

“他的年龄，能提出问题，就能接受真实的答案。我没有往他的脑袋里灌输思想，而是帮助他解开已经在那里的问题。现在的孩子比我们聪明，我一点也不怀疑，他能听懂我对他说的每一个字。好了，戴米，告诉我，你把你的心灵放在哪里了？”

要是这个男孩像亚西比德[1]那样地回答说：“老天爷作证，苏格拉底，我说不出。”外公也不会感到奇怪。但是他像只沉思的幼鹳，单腿站立了一会儿，然后沉着肯定地回答说：“在我的小肚子里。”老先生只能跟着外婆笑起来，结束了这堂哲学课。

要不是戴米令人信服地证实了他既是萌芽的哲学家，也是真正的孩子，母亲会有理由焦虑的。哲学的讨论常常使汉娜不祥地点头预言说：“这孩子不会在这个世上长留。”好在他转身马上玩起恶作剧，这足以打消她的担忧。可爱的、糟糕的、淘气的捣蛋鬼们的胡闹，总是让父母亲悲喜交加。

美格制定了许多道德准则，并准备实施下去。但是，有哪一个母亲曾抵制住这些袖珍男女迷人的诡计、机灵的推诿、不声不响的放肆呢？他们还那么小，就表现出了机灵鬼[2]的才能。

“不能再吃葡萄干了，戴米，会生病的。”在葡萄干布丁节，妈妈对那个老是定期来帮厨的小大人说。

“我喜欢生病。”

“我不要你帮忙，走开，帮助戴茜做小馅饼去。”

他不情愿地离开了，但这个冤屈沉重地压在他的心头，不久昭雪的机会来了，他以精明的交易胜过了妈妈。

“好了，你们都很乖，现在你们喜欢玩什么，我就玩什么。”美格说着，把她的小帮厨带到楼上，此时布丁已经安全地进了锅子发酵。

“真的，妈——妈？”戴米问，一个绝妙的主意出现在他撒满了粉的脑袋里。

“真的，随你说吧。”母亲说话似乎太欠考虑。她心里准备着把《三只小猫》唱上个六七遍，或者不顾劳累把全家带去“买个便士小面包”。但戴米的冷静回答把她逼到了墙角：

“那么，我们去把所有的葡萄干都吃光。”

乔乔姨是两个孩子的主要玩伴和知心朋友，他们三个人把小屋子弄得乱七八糟。艾美姨对他们来说，还只是个名字，贝丝姨的愉快记忆不久就淡去了。但乔乔姨是活生生的现实，他们对她极为重视，有此恭维深深地感动了她。但是巴尔先生来了，乔疏远了玩伴，这两个小生灵感到沮丧和凄凉。喜欢到处兜售吻的戴茜失去了最佳顾客，破产了。戴米用稚嫩的眼睛观察，不久就发现，比起自己，乔乔姨更喜欢跟“熊人”玩。尽管受到了伤害，但他忍气吞声，因为没有勇气去羞辱这样一个对手。对方背心口袋里总是源源不断地产出巧克力豆，还有一只表可以从匣子里拿出来任凭热情的欣赏者摇晃。

有人会认为，这些讨人欢心的特许是贿赂，但戴米不是这么看，继续以若有所思的友好态度光顾这个“熊人”，而小戴茜在他第三次拜访时就喜欢上了他，认为他的肩膀是她的宝座，他的手臂是她的庇护所，他的礼物是极有价值的宝贝。

绅士们有时会心血来潮，喜欢起他们所仰慕的女士们的小亲戚来，但是这种假模假样爱小孩儿的表现与他们很不协调，一点儿也骗不了人。然而，巴尔先生对孩子的爱是真诚的，尽管同样奏效——在法律问题上诚实最是上策，爱的问题也一样。他是那种天生能跟小孩混熟的男人，当小脸蛋与他那张男子汉的脸形成愉快的对比时，他显得尤其可爱。他的事情，不管是什么事情，把他一天天地耽搁在这里，而且晚上也很少不来光顾的——嘿，他总是来找马奇先生，所以我以为是马奇先生吸引了他。这个优秀的爸爸为这个假象所迷惑，以为自己是有吸引力，扬扬得意地与这个同好进行长时间的交流，直到有一天，他那更具有观察力的外孙偶然的一句话，让他如梦初醒。

一天傍晚，巴尔先生来了，他在书房的门口停下，对眼前的情景感到惊讶。马奇先生躺在地上，尊贵的双腿翘起在空中，身边的戴米也趴着，用他那双穿着红色长袜的短腿，努力去模仿外公的姿势。这两个“五体投地”的人非常投入，没有意识到来了些观众，直到巴尔先生朗朗地笑出声来，大为不快的乔大叫起来：

“爸爸，爸爸，教授来了。”

一双黑腿放下来，白头抬起来。这位导师尊严依旧地说：“晚上好，巴尔先生。请稍等，我们就要完成功课了。来，戴米摆出这个字母，然后念出来。”

经过一些前仰后合的努力，那双红腿摆出了一只圆规的形状，然后这个聪明伶俐的学生凯旋般地说：“我认识！这是‘We（V）'，外东（公），这是We! ”

“他生来就是个韦勒[3]。”乔笑着说。父亲起来了，外甥却要倒立，这是他庆祝放学的唯一表达方式。

“你今天都做了什么了，bübchen[4]? ”巴尔先生拉起这个体操运动员问。

“我去看过小玛丽了。”

“在那里做了什么？”

“吻了她。”戴米毫不掩饰地回答。

“呸！汝开始得太早了。那个小玛丽怎么说？”巴尔先生问，继续要小罪人忏悔，后者正站在他的膝盖上探索马甲背心的口袋。

“噢，她喜欢，她也吻了我，我也喜欢。难道小男孩不是喜欢小女孩的？”戴米问，他嘴巴塞得满满的，一副满足的样子。

“这只早熟的小鸡！是谁把这塞到你的脑袋里的？”乔问。她和教授一样欣赏这天真无瑕的坦白。

“不是在脑袋里，是在嘴里。”抠字眼的戴米回答说。他伸出舌头，上面有颗巧克力糖，以为乔指的是糖果，而不是思想。

“你应该省下一些送给那个小朋友。甜糖送甜心，小达（大）人。”巴尔先生递给乔一些巧克力豆，脸上的表情让她纳闷，巧克力是不是众神饮用的美酒。戴米也看到了他的微笑，深受触动，他直通通地问：

“大男孩也喜欢大女孩吗，家（教）授？? ”

巴尔先生和小华盛顿[5]一样不会说谎，所以含含糊糊地回答说，依他看，有时候是这样的。那说话的口气使马奇先生放下手里的衣服刷，扫视一眼乔那腼腆的脸庞，然后一屁股坐到椅子上，仿佛那只“早熟的小鸡”把一种思想塞进了他的脑袋，这种滋味甜甜的、酸酸的。

半小时后，乔在瓷器橱里抓到了戴米，她没有因为他钻进来而推搡他，而是亲热地搂抱他，几乎让这小身体窒息。为什么乔乔姨在这异常的举动后，还意想不到地赏给他一大片面包和果冻？这个问题一直困扰着小脑袋，最后被迫让它悬着，永远不去解答。

第四十六章　伞下定情


劳里和艾美把家整理妥帖，计划着幸福的未来。夫妻俩在天鹅绒的地毯上悠闲地踱步。此时，巴尔先生和乔正享受着另一种情趣，他们漫步在泥泞的路上和湿透的田野里。

“我总是在傍晚时分散步，不知道为什么要放弃这个习惯，难道就因为常常碰上出来散步的教授吗？”两三次不期而遇后，乔自言自语地说。尽管通往美格家有两条路可走，但不管来来去去，走哪一条都会碰到他。他总是快步如飞，不到走得很近，似乎看不见她。他给人的感觉是，他的近视眼只有在那一刻才能认出这位走近的女士。而且，如果她是去美格家，他总是带了一些东西哄小孩；如果她是在回家，他则恰好刚看完河回来。希望他们没有腻烦他的频繁造访吧？

在这种情况下，乔除了礼貌地打招呼，邀请他进屋，还能有其他选择吗？哪怕是厌倦了他的拜访，她也滴水不漏地掩饰起了自己的疲惫，关照晚餐要有咖啡，“因为弗里德里克——我是说巴尔先生——不喜欢喝茶”。

到了第二个礼拜，每个人都对整个情况心知肚明了，然而大家都装着对乔脸色的变化全然不知。他们从来不问，她为什么工作中唱歌，为什么一天梳三次头，为什么傍晚的散步会让她脸色红润。父亲在跟巴尔教授谈论哲学的同时，也在给女儿上爱情课，关于这一点似乎没有人有丝毫的怀疑。

乔芳心有主，却方寸大乱，甚至不能维持正常的礼仪了。不过，她还是毅然决然要按捺住自己的感情，结果没有成功，便更加忐忑不安了。她曾多次激烈地宣言独立，所以极度害怕别人笑话自己被招安。她尤其害怕劳里，但是多亏那个新当家的，他的言行很恰当，难能可贵。他从不当众称巴尔先生“一等一的老家伙”，对乔今非昔比的外表也不以任何方式影射，看到教授的帽子几乎每天晚上都出现在马奇家的桌子上，也没有表示丝毫的惊讶。但他暗自欣喜若狂，渴望送礼时刻的到来，到时候可以送给乔一件金质餐具，上面铭刻着一头熊和一根破权杖，作为贴切的盾形纹章。

连续两个礼拜，教授像情郎似的有规律地来来回回。然后，接连三天不露面，连影子都不见。这使得每个人都严肃起来，乔先是变得深沉，后来——哎哟罗曼史！——常发脾气。

“讨厌我了，我敢说，突然回去了，就像来时那样。当然，没什么大不了的，但我觉得他应该像个绅士那样，来向我们道个别。”她神色绝望地瞧着大门，自言自语地说。这是一个阴沉沉的下午，她穿戴停当，准备例行散步。

“你还是带上小雨伞吧，乖乖，像是要下雨。”母亲注意到了她戴着新帽子，但没有点破。

“好的，妈咪，有东西要买吗？我得去镇上买点纸。”乔回答说。她站在镜子前面，拉出领子上的蝴蝶结，回避母亲对视的目光。

“有，我要买些斜纹里子布，一板九号针，二码淡紫色窄丝带。穿厚靴子了吗？有没有穿上保暖一点的衣服？”

“我想是的。”乔心不在焉地回答。

“要是碰到巴尔先生，请他来喝茶。我很想看到这位可爱的人呢。”马奇太太补充道。

乔听到了，但没有回答，只是亲吻一下母亲，便匆匆离开了。虽然她的心在作疼，但一股感激的暖流涌上心头：“她对我多好啊！那些没有母亲来帮助渡过难关的女孩子该怎么办哪？”

纺织品店和批发店与男士成堆的账房、银行不在一个区域，但乔一样差事还没办，却鬼使神差地出现在镇上的这个地段。她徘徊着，像是在等人。她带着与女人极不相符的兴趣，在这个橱窗看看工程器械，在那个窗口看看羊毛样品，不小心被几个桶绊了一跤，差点儿被落下来的货物埋进去。几个忙碌着的男人大手大脚地把她推开，脸上的表情似乎在奇怪：“见鬼，她怎么会到这里来？”一滴雨落在脸颊上，把她的思绪从受挫的希望带回到毁坏的丝带。雨点继续落下，身为情侣兼女人，她感到尽管挽救她那颗心已为时过晚，但她还可以挽救她的帽子。此刻，她记起了那把小雨伞，匆忙中她忘记带上了，世上没有后悔药，别无他法，只能去借一把，或者任由雨水淋湿全身。她抬眼望望昏沉沉的天空，低头看看深红色的蝴蝶结，上面已有斑斑黑点，朝前看是泥泞的街道，再往后恋恋不舍地看了很久，有一个破旧的商店，只见门上写着“霍夫曼·斯瓦茨公司”。她严厉地责备起自己来：“活该！我为什么要穿上最好的衣服，轻佻地来到这里，希望见到教授？乔，我为你感到羞耻！不，你不能到那里去借雨伞，也不能向他朋友打听他的下落。你应该走开，冒雨完成差事。如果得病死了，帽子淋坏了，那是你自找的。行啦，就这么着了！”

她想着想着就鲁莽地冲过街去，差点儿被一辆迎面驶来的马车轧死，突然又跟一个正儿八经的老先生撞个满怀。他嘴里说着：“对不起，小姐。”脸上的表情却是非常生气。乔有点沮丧，她调整了一下情绪，拿出手帕盖住那心爱的丝带，把诱惑抛在脑后，急忙赶路，她的脚踝越来越湿，头顶上是过往行人雨伞的碰撞声。突然，有一把破旧的蓝雨伞定格在她那没有保护的帽子上，引起她的注意，抬头一看，是巴尔先生正低头望着她。

“我觉得我认识这位意志坚强的女子，她居然这么勇敢地在许多马匹鼻子下穿行，这么快速地跋涉在泥泞路上。来这里干什么，我的朋友？”

“购物。”

巴尔先生笑了，眼睛从这边的泡菜坊，扫视到街对面的皮革制品批发商店。但他只是礼貌地说：“你没有雨伞。我可以送你一程，帮你拿东西吗？”

“可以，谢谢。”

乔的脸跟她的丝带一样红了。不知道他会怎么看待她，但她才不在乎呢。不一会儿，她已经和她的教授手挽手走着了。那感觉就像太阳忽然冲出乌云，光芒四射，世界又恢复了正常。一个极度幸福的女人，那一天就这样蹚着水走着。

“我们以为你离开了。”乔急忙说，她知道他在看着她。帽子不够大，遮不住她的脸。她害怕他会认为自己脸上显露出来的高兴神情不符合少女身份。

“你认为，我会跟那些对我那么亲善的人不告而别吗？”他带着责备的口气问，使得她感到好像自己诋毁了他。她热诚地回答说：

“不，我不认为。我知道你正忙着事情，但我们都很想念你——尤其是爸爸妈妈。”

“你呢？”

“见到你我总是很高兴，先生。”

她急切地要把自己的声音控制得相当平和，结果显得相当冷淡，末尾那个冷若冰霜的称呼似乎使教授寒心。他的笑容消失了，只听他严肃地说：

“我谢谢你，离开之前，我会再来一次。”

“这么说，你要走了？”

“这里我不会再有事了，办完了。”

“想必办得很成功吧？”乔问，对他那简短的回答失望痛苦。

“应该这么认为，我打开了路子，能为自己赚来面包，并且对我的Junglings[1]有很大帮助。”

“告诉我，求你啦！我想知道一切，有关——有关孩子们的。”乔急切地说。

“好心人，我很高兴告诉你。朋友帮我在一所学院里找了差事，可以像在自己国家一样教书，可以赚到足够的钱来为弗兰茨和埃米尔铺平道路。就这一点我就应该欣慰，是不是？”

“的确应该。做自己喜欢做的事，太棒了。我也可以经常看到你和孩子们！”乔高兴得叫了起来，她坚持用孩子们做借口来掩饰自己那种无法隐藏的满意神情。

“啊！恐怕我们不能经常见面，学校在西部。”

“那么远！”她放开手里拎着的裙子，听之任之，仿佛现在衣服会怎么样或者她自己会怎么样都已经无所谓了。

巴尔先生能读懂好几门语言，但他还没有学会读懂女人。他自诩很了解乔，因此他对乔的表现感到困惑，那天她的声音、脸部表情和举止相互矛盾，快速变换着，因为半个小时经历了五六种不同的心情。刚遇见他的时候，她显得惊讶，她说了来这儿的目的，但不可能不使人对她的这个目的产生怀疑。当他把胳膊伸出来让她挽着的时候，她的表情让他充满了喜悦。但是，当他问她是否想他时，她的回答又冷淡又古板，让他很失望。听到他的好运气时，她高兴得几乎要鼓掌。她纯粹是为孩子们高兴吗？然后，她听到他的目的地时，说了声“那么远！”她说话的口气是那么的绝望，把他送到了希望的顶峰。但是过了一会儿，她说了句话，像是全神贯注在差事上，又使他从顶峰上摔了下来：“我办差事的地方到了。愿意进去吗？时间不会长的。”

乔对自己的采购能力相当自豪，尤其希望给她的陪同留下干净利索完成差事的印象。但由于她心慌意乱，一切都乱了套。她打翻了盛着针的盘子，里子布剪下来后才想起来应该是斜纹的，零钱也给错了，还在棉布柜台找淡紫色丝带，真是焦头烂额。巴尔先生站在一旁，见她又是红脸又是犯错，看着看着，他的困惑似乎消退了。他开始明白，有时候，女人像做梦一样，要反过来看的。

他们出来的时候，他把那包东西夹在胳膊下，脸色愉快了。他踩着水坑走着，任凭污水飞溅，好像他还是很喜欢这样。

“如果今晚去你那个温馨的家作最后的拜访，我们是不是该给孩子来点你说的采购，来个告别晚宴？”他停在一个摆满水果鲜花的橱窗前问。

“买什么呢？”乔问道，没有去接他的前半个话题。他们走进商店，她装作很高兴的样子，闻着各种鲜花水果混合着的香味。

“他们可以吃橘子和无花果吗？”巴尔先生父亲似的问。

“拿到就吃。”

“你喜欢吃坚果吗？”

“像只松鼠。”

“汉堡葡萄。对了，我们吃着这些东西为祖国（德国）干杯，好不好？”

乔皱起了眉头，觉得那个太铺张了，问他何不买一篓枣子、一桶葡萄干和一袋杏仁来祝酒？巴尔先生随即拿下了她的钱包，掏出自己的钱包，买了几磅葡萄、一盆玫瑰红雏菊和一坛漂亮的蜂蜜。说它漂亮是因为那个广口瓶可爱。他把瓶瓶罐罐装在他的几个口袋里，撑得口袋走了形。他把花儿交给她拿着，自己打起那把旧雨伞，又继续前进了。

“马希小姐，我想请你帮个大忙。”涉水走了半个街区后，教授开口说道。

“说吧，先生。”乔的心猛烈地跳起来，她担心他会听见。

“尽管在下雨，我还是大胆提这个要求，留给我的时间不多了。”

“你说吧，先生。”乔紧张得突然一使劲，差点把手上的小花盆给捏碎了。

“想给我的蒂娜买件小连衣裙，我太笨了，自己买不好。你能给我参谋参谋款式，帮我挑好吗？”

“好的，先生。”乔感到自己仿佛步入了冰库，那颗心突然变得平静淡漠了。

“也许还要给蒂娜的母亲买条披肩。她那么穷，身体那么差，丈夫又那么令人操心。对，对，一条厚厚的保暖披肩对这个小母亲来说是再友好不过了。”

“我很乐意帮忙，巴尔先生。”接着，乔自言自语道，“我进展得太快，他分分秒秒变得越来越可爱了。”她带着精神上的震颤，热心地投入了这项工作，那样子看上去很可爱。

巴尔先生放手让她挑选，她给蒂娜选了一件漂亮的礼服，然后叫店员拿披肩。店员是个已婚的男士，态度谦恭，对他们挺感兴趣，认为他们是前来采购的夫妻。

“尊夫人可以选这条，质量很好，颜色很悦目，相当朴素高雅。”他说着抖开一条可心的灰色披肩，披在乔的肩上。

“你觉得合适吗，巴尔先生？”她问着把背转向他，庆幸这个能掩饰自己表情的机会。

“非常好，我们买。”教授回答说。付钱的时候他暗自笑了，而乔继续搜索柜台，像是个专找便宜货的人。

“现在我们该回家了吧？”他问，好像这几个词很让他高兴。

“是的，时间已晚，我也很累了。”乔的声音凄凉得自己都不知道，因为此刻太阳像突然出来那样地突然躲起来了，世界又恢复了泥泞和凄苦。她第一次发现自己的双脚冰冷，脑袋疼痛，而心则比脚更冷，比头更疼。巴尔先生要离开了，他只是把她当作一个朋友似的喜欢她，一切都是个误会，结束得越快越好。她一边这么想着，一边去招呼一辆驶近的公共马车，动作毛毛躁躁的，结果雏菊被甩出了花盆，掉在地上打烂了。

“这不是我们的车。”教授说着，挥挥手，让满载乘客的车子走了。他停下来捡起那些可怜的小花。

“请原谅，没看清楚车名。没关系，我可以步行。我习惯在泥泞的路上行走。”乔使劲眨着眼，宁死也不愿公开抹眼泪。

尽管她把脸转向别处，巴尔先生还是看到了她脸上的泪珠。这情景仿佛让他很感动，他突然弯下身子意味深长地问：“宝贝儿，为什么哭啦？”

要不是乔在这种事情上很嫩，她会说她没有哭，只是有点感冒，或者逢场作戏，随便撒点儿女人可撒的小谎。可是，她没这么说，还控制不住地抽泣起来，有失自尊地回答说：“因为你要离开了。”

“Ach, mein Gott[2]，太棒了！”巴尔先生叫着，费劲地鼓起掌来，因为手上有雨伞，胳膊下还夹着包包。“乔，我没有什么能给你，但我有很多的爱。我来这里就是要知道，你是不是在乎我的爱，我等待着有一天能确信我比朋友更进一步。现在等到了吧？你能在心里给老弗里茨留一个小小的位置吗？”他一口气说出了这一连串话。

“哦，当然能！”乔说。他太满足了，因为她双手抱住了他的胳膊，抬头望着他。脸上的表情明白地显示，人生有他的陪伴，她会是多么的幸福，哪怕没有比旧雨伞更好的庇护，只要有他举着。

这当然是困难条件下的求婚，因为满地泥浆，即使巴尔先生想跪下来求婚也不可能做到。因为两手都拿着东西，他也伸不出手来，除了象征性地伸手。更不能在大街上放纵温柔的表白，尽管他跃跃欲试。他狂喜之情的唯一表达方式就是看着她，那种表情使他容光焕发，以至于胡子上闪闪发亮的水珠居然看上去像小彩虹。如果他不是非常爱乔，他不可能有这种表情。她看上去根本谈不上可爱，裙子一塌糊涂，脚脖子以下的胶靴上溅满了泥水，帽子也淋坏了。好在巴尔先生认为她是世上最美的女人，而她也觉得他比任何时候都更像朱庇特，虽然他的帽边软软的，雨水从帽沟上滴下来，然后落到肩膀上（他把伞打在乔的头上），他手套上的每一个指头都需要缝补。

路人可能会认为，他们是一对不会伤人的疯子，因为他们完全忘记了喊一辆车子，悠闲地散着步，没在意渐浓的暮色和雨雾。不在乎人家会怎么想，因为他们在享受着幸福的时光，这种幸福很少见，一生只有一次。这种有魔力的时光会使人返老还童，变丑为美，以富易穷，让人心预先品尝一下天堂的滋味。教授的神情像是他已征服了一个王国，这个世界上他不再有更多的赐福了。乔紧跟在他身后，觉得自己的位置似乎一直在这里，不明白自己以前居然还会有其他的选择。当然，她首先开口说话——我的意思是能够清楚说话，继她脱口而出的“哦，当然能！”之后，她那些情话就不具有连贯性或者可转述性了。

“弗里德里希，为什么你不——? ”

“哦，天哪，自从米娜死后，没有人这样称呼我！”教授在一个水坑里停下来，看着她又感激又高兴地说。

“刚才我忘了，其实我总是在心里这样称呼你，如果你不喜欢，以后不会这样叫了。”

“喜欢？这样称呼我，我心里有说不出的甜蜜。你也可以称‘郎’，我想你们的语言和我们的语言几乎是一样美丽。”

“称‘郎’，不会有点太多情吧？”乔嘴上这么问，暗自却想这可是个可爱的字。

“多情？是的，感谢上帝，我们德国人信奉情意，它能让我们保持年轻。你们英语中的‘你’太冷漠了，称‘郎’吧，宝贝儿，它对我意味深长。”巴尔先生请求道，此刻他一点也不像庄重的教授，倒更像一个浪漫的学生。

“那好吧，郎为什么不早点告诉我这些？”乔含羞问道。

“现在我把心掏出来给妹，我高兴这样，因为妹从此以后就得照料它。瞧，这个，我的乔啊——可爱而有趣的名字——在纽约告别的那一天，我就想说些什么，但我想那个英俊的朋友和妹订婚了，所以没开口。如果那时我说了，妹会同意吗？”

“不知道，恐怕不会，那时候我根本没那个心。”

“不！这个我不相信。它一直在睡觉，直到白马王子穿过树林，把它唤醒。啊，好啦，‘Die erste Liebe ist die beste'[3]，但我不能有这个奢望。”

“是的，初恋是最美好的。你满足了吧，我从来没有恋爱过。特迪只是个男孩，很快就克服了对他的小幻想。”乔说。她急于纠正教授的错误。

“好极了！那就心满意足了，妹要保证给了我全部。我等了那么长的时间，变得自私了，妹会发现的，教授夫人。”

“我喜欢这个。”听到这个新的名字她高兴得叫起来，“现在告诉我，是什么把你带到这里，在我需要你的时候，你终于来了？”

“是这个。”巴尔先生从马甲背心口袋里掏出一张有点皱巴巴的纸。

乔打开那张纸，显得很窘迫。那是她给一家报社的诗稿之一，这个报社付稿费，所以她偶尔还投投稿。

“它怎么能把你带来？”她问道，不理解他的意思。

“我是偶然发现它的。我从诗中的人名和缩写字母的署名判断出来，诗中有一节似乎在召唤我。读吧，把他找到。我会看着不让你踩到水里。”

乔听从了，匆匆浏览着诗句，她取的题目是：

阁楼里





四只小箱排成行，

尘封无光，岁月苍苍，

很久以前成形，装满，

出自而今正值青春年华的孩子。

四把小钥匙并排挂着，

褪色的丝带，从前的雨天，

系上时华丽而鲜艳，

带着稚嫩的骄傲。

四个小名字，每个盖子一个，

是男孩的手刻出，

盖子下面藏着

这帮幸福人儿的历史。

曾经玩耍在这里，经常停住，

去倾听甜蜜的节奏，

它来自高高的屋顶，

淅沥而落的夏雨。





“美格”刻在首位，平滑又漂亮。

我用爱的眼睛往里瞧，

细心地折叠，众所周知，

颇丰的收集，优美地摆放，

平和安宁生活的档案——

给温柔女孩的礼物，

新娘的礼服，致妻子的诗，

袖珍的鞋，婴儿的鬈发。

没有玩具留在第一箱，

都取走了，

等岁月苍苍，又去加入

另一个小美格的游戏。

啊，幸福的母亲！我知晓

你听到了催眠曲，像甜蜜的副歌，

永远温柔而轻声，

淅沥而落的夏雨。





“乔”刻在第二位，潦草又破旧，

里面混杂而丰富，

无头娃娃，破教科书，

不再发声的鸟兽；

战利品来自童话仙境

仅由年轻的脚踩踏过。

未来的梦无从找到，

过去的回忆依旧美好；

半辍的诗，胡诌的故事，

四月的书信，知暖又知冷，

任性孩子的日记，

暗示着一个女人提前衰老；

女人在孤独的家里，

听着，像哀伤的副歌——

“值得爱，爱会来”，

淅沥而落的夏雨。





我的贝丝！刻着你名字的盖子，

始终在掸尘，

仿佛热泪滚滚的眼睛扫过，

仔细的纤手常常抹过。

死神为我们封了圣徒一位，

不在人间，位列仙境，

我们仍然如泣如诉，

将遗物供奉家庙——

银铃不常摇，

小帽临终戴，

漂亮的凯瑟琳

挂在门上方，为天使所负；

她那无哀诉的歌儿，

囚禁于痛苦中，

永远曼妙地混杂在

淅沥而落的夏雨。





最后一箱盖是贼亮的场地——

美丽传说成真

骁勇骑士的盾牌

刻着“艾美”的蓝色金字。

里面躺着她的束发网，

弃用的舞鞋，

枯花悉心藏，

不再劳累的扇子；

情人节花哨卡片，余炽尤烈，

事无巨细，每一件都曾分享，

女孩的希望、担心、娇羞，

记录下少女的心

如今学会了更美更真的魔法，

听着，如轻松的副歌，

那婚礼钟声银铃般交集，

淅沥而落的夏雨。





四只小箱排成行，

尘封无光，岁月苍苍，

四个妇人，转益祸福是我师

青春年华，去爱去劳动。

四个姐妹短暂离别，

无人迷途，只有一个先行。

爱的力量不朽，

使她们越发亲近。

啊，当我们的这些存储

展现在天父的眼前，

愿它们丰富在金色时光里

事迹因灵光而更美，

生命的华章经久奏响，

如激荡心灵的副歌，

灵魂高兴地翱翔歌唱

在雨后绵绵的艳阳天。

“这首诗太烂了，但我是有感而发。那一天我很孤独，对着碎布袋痛哭了一场。绝没想到它还会出去讲故事。”乔说着把教授长时间珍藏的诗撕个粉碎。

“让它去吧，它已尽了义务。在我读完记着她小秘密的褐色笔记本时，我会有她的新作的。”巴尔先生自语道，微笑地看着碎片随风飘落。“是的，”他诚挚地补充道，“我读过它，心里想，她有痛苦，她很孤独，她会在真爱中找到安慰。我心中充满了爱，充满了对她的爱。难道我不应该去表白：‘如果这份爱不是太卑微的话，看在上帝的分上接受它吧，换取我所希望得到的。'”

“所以你来了，发现你的这份爱不是太卑微，而是我所需要的宝贵东西。”乔低声说。

“起先我没勇气这么想，尽管你非常友好地欢迎我。但不久我开始希望了，于是对自己说：‘哪怕付出生命我也要得到她。’我会得到的！”巴尔先生大声地说，蔑视一切地点点头，仿佛笼罩着他们的雾墙是他要战胜的，或者要勇敢地去摧毁的障碍物。

乔心想，那太棒了，她决心要无愧于她的骑士，尽管他没有昂首挺胸地鞭策战马盛装前来。

“是什么原因让你保持距离这么久的？”不一会儿她又问。提这些私密问题，得到的回答总是让人欣喜不已。她太高兴了，所以保持不了沉默。

“很不容易，我没勇气把你从那个幸福的家里带走，而要等到能给你一个美好的前景时，也许要经过很长时间，努力工作以后才能实现。我怎么能要求你为了一个穷酸的老家伙放弃那么多呢？我没有任何财产，只有一点点学问。”

“我很高兴你穷。我不能忍受阔丈夫。”乔斩钉截铁地说。接着用更温柔的语调说：“别担心贫穷。我过惯了贫穷生活，所以不怕贫穷。为我所爱的人工作是一种幸福。别说你自己老——四十正值生命的最好年华。即使你是七十岁，我也会禁不住爱上你的！”

教授感动得热泪盈眶，要是他能伸手去拿手帕，他会很高兴的。因为他不能，所以乔帮他擦去了眼泪，从他手里拿走一两包东西，笑着说：

“我可能固执己见，但没有人可以说我超出了能力范围，因为女人的特殊使命是擦干眼泪和承担重负。我要去承担我的那份重负，弗里德里希，帮助你赚钱养家。这一点你要拿定主意，否则我绝不去。”她坚决地补充道，此时他在试图拿回他的负担。

“到时候再看。你有耐心长时间等待吗，乔？我必须离开，一个人去干我的工作。我必须首先扶助外甥们，因为，即使是为了你，我也不能对米娜食言。你能理解吗？你能乐意我们希望着、等待着吗？”

“是的，我能，因为我们彼此相爱，这就足以使一切变得容易忍受。我也有我的义务，我的工作。如果忽视了它们，即使是为了你，我不会过得快活。因此，没必要匆忙或者不耐烦。你可以在西部干你的那份工作，我可以在这里干我的，两个人都幸福地从好处着想，把未来交给上帝来安排。”

“啊！妹给了我如此大的希望和勇气，我无以回报，只有一颗爱心和一双空空的手。”教授感动得无法自持。

乔永远永远学不会矜持。他们站在台阶上，听他说着说着，她就把双手放进他的手里，温柔地耳语道：“现在不是空空的了。”她弯下身子，在雨伞下亲吻了她的弗里德里希。太惊心动魄了，但她会干的，哪怕树篱上那群尾巴湿透的麻雀是人群，因为她真的神游得很远了，全然忽视了世界的存在，只有她自己的幸福。虽然在如此简单的外衣下来临，但这是他俩生命中的尖峰时刻，把黑夜、风暴和孤独变成了家里的灯光，温暖和安宁在等待着迎接他们。“欢迎回家！”乔高兴地说着，把爱人领回家，并关上了门。

第四十七章　收获季节


整整一年，乔和她的教授在工作和期待中度过。他们盼望着、恋爱着，偶尔幽会，还写了很多长篇情书，致使一时纸价上涨，劳里是这么说的。第二年，开始显得相当冷静，他们的未来并不明朗，再加上马奇姑婆又突然去世。而当最初的悲伤过去之后——老太太虽然说话尖刻，可她们还是爱她的——她们有理由高兴起来，因为老太太把梅园留给了乔，一下子，各种喜事接踵而来。

“那是个很不错的老庄园，会换来一大笔钱的，你当然会打算卖掉它。”劳里这么说。几个礼拜后，大家在讨论这件事。

“不，我不卖。”乔坚决地回答。她抚弄着那只肥壮的长卷毛狗。出于对原先的女主人的尊重，乔领养了它。

“你不是打算住在那儿吧？”

“是的，我要住去。”

“可是，我亲爱的姑娘，那是非常大的豪宅，管理要花大钱的。光是花园和果园就得两三个人照看。我想巴尔对农活也不懂行。”

“要是我提议，他会在那方面努力的。”

“你指望靠那里的农产品过活？嗯，听起来像乐园，可你会看到，干农活要命的艰苦。”

“我们要种的庄稼，盈利丰厚。”乔笑了起来。

“丰收的庄稼什么样的，小姐？”

“男孩子。我想为小孩子们办一所学校——一所愉快的、家庭式的好学校。我来照顾他们，弗里茨教他们。”

“那可真是乔式计划！这不正是她的样子吗？”劳里喊着，向家里人呼吁。他们和他一样大吃一惊。

“我喜欢那个计划。”马奇太太斩钉截铁地说。

“我也喜欢。”她丈夫补充道。想到有机会对现代青年试行苏格拉底的教育法，他欣然接受。

“乔要操很多的心哪。”美格说，一边抚摸着需要全力以赴的独养儿子的头。

“乔能做到的，会因此而幸福的。绝妙的主意。把全部计划都说说吧。”劳伦斯先生大声说。他一直渴望帮这对情侣的忙，但知道他们不愿意受援。

“我知道你会站在我一边的，先生。艾美也会的——我从眼神里看出来了，虽然她做事谨慎，考虑成熟了才会说。好啦，我的亲人们，”乔诚恳地说道，“你们得理解，这不是我的新花样，而是酝酿已久的计划。在我的弗里茨到来之前，我常考虑，等我发了财，家里又不需要我时，就去租个大房子，收养一些没妈照顾、可怜的小弃儿，照料他们，让他们快乐生活，免得铸成大错。我看到，许许多多弃儿得不到及时的帮助而走向堕落。我非常乐意为他们尽心尽力。我似乎感觉到了他们的需要，我同情他们的困难。啊，我是多么希望做他们的母亲啊！”

马奇太太向乔伸出了手，乔握住。她噙着泪水笑了，像以前那样热情洋溢地说起话来，真是久违了。

“我曾经将计划告诉过弗里茨，他说那正中下怀，他同意等我们富裕了就去试试。上帝保佑那好心人！他一辈子都在这么做——我是说帮助穷孩子们，而不是发家致富，他永远也富不了。钱在他的口袋里放不长，不可能有积蓄的。而如今，多亏了我那好姑婆，承蒙她的错爱，我倒是富有了，至少我这样感觉。要是我们办起人丁兴旺的学校，就能在梅园美满生活。那地方正适合男孩子们，宅子很大，家具朴素结实。屋子里面足以容下几十个人，屋外有漂亮的场地。孩子们能在花园果园帮忙，这样的工作有益健康，是不是，先生？而且弗里茨可以用他的方式训练、教育孩子们。爸爸可以帮忙的。我可以做饭，照顾他们、爱抚他们、责骂他们。妈妈在旁边做备份。我一直盼望能有许多孩子，从来都不嫌多的。现在宅子可以住满了，尽情和可爱的小东西们狂欢。想想那是多么奢侈——梅园是自己的，野地里还有一大群男孩和我一起共享！”

乔手舞足蹈，心驰神往地感叹着。全家人爆发出一阵欢笑。劳伦斯先生大笑不止，他们还以为他中风要发作呢。

“没什么好笑的，”乔等说话能听清时，神情严肃地说，“我的教授开办学校，而我情愿住在自己的田庄，这是再自然、再适当不过的了。”

“她已经在端架子了。”劳里说。他把这个创意看做天大的笑话，“请问你打算用什么来维持学校呢？要是学生们都破衣烂衫，用俗人的观点来看，恐怕你的庄稼不算盈利的，巴尔夫人。”

“哎呀，特迪，别扫兴啦。我当然也会收些有钱的学生——也许全部就以富家子弟开始。然后，等到学校顺利开办了，我就能收下一两个流浪儿，只为增添趣味。富家孩子和穷孩子一样，往往也需要照顾和安慰。我见过不幸的小东西们，都丢给仆人们管着，还有些迟钝的孩子被强迫赶进度，真是残忍。一些孩子因为调教不当照顾不周而变得调皮捣蛋，还有些孩子失去了母亲。但是，再好的孩子也要经过笨手笨脚的青少年时期，就是这个时期最需要耐心友善的开导。可是，人们嘲笑他们，把他们相互推诿，所谓眼不见，心不烦，还指望他们从漂亮小孩子一下子就变成英俊少年呢。知难而进的小家伙们，他们不大发牢骚的——但是他们有感觉。我见识过一些，对此完全了解。对这些小偏才我特别有兴趣。我想使他们看到，尽管他们笨手笨脚，头脑乱七八糟，我看到了这些男孩子热情、诚实、心地善良。我也有经验的，难道我不是养育了一个男孩，成为他家人的自豪和光荣吗？”

“我可以作证，你有那种尝试。”劳里带着感激的神色说。

“而且，成功超乎我的希望。因为，你就在这里，一个稳重、精明的商人，用你的钱财做了大量的善事。你不是在积累美元，而是在积累穷人的祝福。你不仅仅是个商人，你崇尚善和美的事物，自己享有，也让别人分享一半，就像过去常做的那样。特迪，我真为你骄傲，你一天天都在进步。虽然你不让宣扬，但大家都感到了这一点。是的，等我有了一群孩子，我就会指着你说：‘孩子们，那就是你们的榜样。'”

可怜的劳里眼睛不知朝哪边看了。这一阵赞扬使得所有的脸都转向他，大家赞许地看着他，尽管他是堂堂正正的男子汉，从前那种羞怯又笼罩了他。

“我说，乔，那样太过分了。”他就以从前那种男孩的口气说，“你们都为我做了许多，我感激不尽的，只能尽力不辜负你们而已。最近你完全抛弃我了，乔，可我还是得到了最好的帮助。所以，要说我有什么进步，可以感谢这两位。”他一只手轻轻地放在爷爷的白发脑袋上，另一只手放在艾美的金发上。他们三个人从来都不长时间分开的。

“我真的认为世界上最美好的东西就是家庭！”乔脱口而出。此时，她的情绪异常高涨。“我自己成了家后，希望和另外三个非常熟悉、无比热爱的家庭一样幸福。要是约翰和我的弗里茨也在这里，那真是人间的一个小天堂。”她接着压低声音说。那天晚上，一家人快活地召开了家庭会议，讨论了希望和打算，乔回到自己的房间时，心中充满了幸福。她跪在一直靠近自己铺位的那张空床边，柔情地想着贝丝，心里方才平静下来。

总的说来，那一年惊喜不断，一切都显得异常顺利，令人心情愉快。乔几乎还没明白是怎么回事，就发现自己已经结了婚，并在梅园定居。然后家里如雨后春笋般冒出六七个小男孩，奇怪的是，学校办得热热闹闹，招收的既有富家子弟，也有穷孩子，因为劳伦斯先生不断地发现一些赤贫的动人个案，恳求巴尔夫妇能怜悯孩子，他乐于付些小钱给予资助。就这样，足智多谋的老人战胜了高傲的乔，并为她带来了她最喜欢的那种男孩。

当然，万事开头难，起初乔也犯了一些古怪的错误。可才智过人的教授将她安全地引到了平静的水域，连最不听话的流浪儿最后也被管得服服帖帖。乔是多么喜欢“男孩们的野地”！梅园以前是个神圣的院落，规规矩矩，收拾得井井有条，可现在被那帮汤姆们、迪克们和哈里们搅得天翻地覆。要是可怜的、可爱的马奇姑婆健在，见到这一幕，她会多么，多么痛心疾首！可毕竟，这里还有一种诗意的公正，因为过去方圆几里内的男孩都惧怕老太太。现在这些逃亡者肆无忌惮地偷吃李子禁果，他们用肮脏的靴子踢起沙砾，也没人责骂；在空旷的场地里玩板球，而那里那个易怒的“弯角牛”过去常常引莽撞的半大孩子来挨挑。这里简直成了男孩乐园。劳里提议，应该管它叫做“巴尔花园”，既是对主人表示敬意，对它的居民也很贴切。

学校从来不赶时髦，教授也没有发财。可乔就想学校成为这个样子——“那些需要教导、照顾和体贴的男孩们的幸福家园”。大宅子里，各个房间很快就住满了人，花园里的土地都各各有了主，允许养宠物，所以谷仓畜棚内有了个像样的动物园，一天三次。乔坐在长桌子一端，冲着她的弗里茨笑，桌子两边是一排排开心的小脸蛋，他们都充满深情地望着她，对“巴尔妈妈”满怀感激和敬慕，向她吐露心声。现在孩子够多了，可她并不觉得腻烦，虽然他们无论如何都称不上是天使，而且一些孩子还会给教授和夫人带来诸多麻烦和焦虑。可她坚信，即使最调皮、最无礼、最让人揪心的小流浪儿，心中都有优点，只要有耐心，用适当的技巧总能把他们驯服。巴尔爸爸像太阳一样慈爱地照耀着他们，巴尔妈妈宽恕他们七七四十九次，只要是凡人都不会顽抗到底。让乔最感珍贵的是与小家伙们的友谊，干了坏事后悔过的抽噎，小声认错，滑稽或感人的悄悄话。他们讨人喜欢的热情、希望和打算，甚至他们的不幸，因为这些使乔对他们倍加疼爱。男孩们有的反应迟钝，有的生性羞怯；有的身体虚弱，有的调皮捣蛋；有的口齿不清，有的结结巴巴；有一两个缺胳膊短腿的；还一个开心的小混血儿，哪儿也不要他，却在“巴尔花园”受到了欢迎，虽然有些人预言录取他会毁了这座学校。

真的，那里尽管工作艰辛，操心事多，还要忍受无休止的吵闹，可乔过得幸福美满。她由衷地喜欢这一切，发现孩子们的喝彩最令人满意，胜过世上的任何称颂。现在她把故事只讲给她的那群满腔热情的信徒和崇拜者。时光飞逝，自己的两个小男孩也来喜上加喜——一个叫罗布，跟外公的名，另一个叫特迪，是个乐天派的婴儿，他似乎继承了爸爸阳光的性格和妈妈充沛的精力。在这些乱糟糟的孩子堆里，他们怎样活得下去，外婆和阿姨们始终搞不懂。他们像春天蒲公英一样茁壮成长，那些保姆虽然粗野，但很疼爱他们，对他们照顾得很周到。

梅园有很多假日，其中最愉快的一个，要数一年一度的摘苹果节，因为马奇夫妇、劳伦斯夫妇、布鲁克夫妇和巴尔夫妇要全体出动，庆祝一番。乔结婚已经五年了，又盼来了一个硕果累累的丰收季节——十月的一天，佳果成熟，空气里弥漫着令人兴奋的清香，使人感觉精神焕发，血脉健康地奔腾。古老的果园穿上了节日的盛装：长满青苔的墙上点缀着一枝黄花和翠菊；枯草丛中，蚱蜢轻快地蹦跳，蟋蟀唧唧地鸣唱，就像童话中宴会上的吹笛手；松鼠们也忙着小秋收；鸟儿们在小路边的桤木上唧唧喳喳地唱着，向秋天道别；每棵树都只要一摇，就落下一阵苹果雨，有红的也有黄的。人到齐了，大家唱着笑着，爬上去，跌下来；每个人都赞同，从来没有像今天这样完美，也从来没有这样一群快乐的人来享受它；每个人都轻松地沉浸在此刻这种朴素的快乐中，仿佛世间根本就没有忧虑和烦恼之类的东西。

马奇先生平静地四处漫步，一边向劳伦斯先生大讲塔瑟[1]、考利[2]和科卢梅拉[3]，一边欣赏：





和醇的苹果，浓郁的果汁。





教授俨然一个强壮的条顿骑士，在绿色的过道里冲上冲下，手执木杆当长矛，率领男孩们摘苹果。男孩子们组成了一支云梯队，在地上翻筋斗和高空落地方面都创造了许多奇迹。劳里专心致力于照看几个小孩，让他家小女儿坐在蒲式耳筐子里推行，把戴茜抱到鸟巢中间，留神喜欢冒险的罗布，以免他摔断脖子。马奇太太和美格坐在苹果堆里，俨然一对波摩娜[4]，拣选不断倒进来的苹果。艾美满脸慈祥的神情，非常漂亮，为不同的人群画素描，一边照看着一个脸色苍白的小家伙。这孩子身边放着小拐杖，坐在一旁崇拜地望着她。

那天，乔有条不紊地忙碌着，跑东跑西。她把长裙别了起来，帽子也不知到了哪里，手臂下夹着婴儿，随时准备应付任何可能出现的惊险场面。小特迪总能逢凶化吉，什么事都没有。乔从来都不担心，不管他被哪个小家伙飞快地送上树，还是由另一个小家伙背着飞奔开去，甚至看到迁就的爸爸给他喂褐色的酸苹果，她也不担心。这位爸爸富有日耳曼人的幻想，坚信小孩子吃什么东西都能消化，不管是腌菜、纽扣，还是钉子，连他们的小鞋也不例外。她知道，小特迪迟早总会安全出现，虽然样子脏兮兮，可还是脸色红润，平安无事。她总会由衷地欢迎他回来，因为乔深爱着她的两个孩子。

四点钟，劳动告一段落。篮子空了，摘苹果的人们休息了，攀比着衣服的裂缝和身上的擦伤。接着，乔和美格带领一队大男孩子在草地上摊开晚餐。露天茶点总是节庆的最高潮。毫不夸张地说，在这种时候，场地上真的成了奶和蜜之地，因为小家伙们不被要求坐在桌子边，允许随意地享受茶点——自由这种调料是男孩子的最爱，他们充分享用这个难得的特权。有些人觉得好玩，便试着倒立着喝牛奶；其他人做着跳背游戏，中间停下来吃一口馅饼，玩出了花样。最后弄得饼干播撒得到处都是，苹果酥饼夹在树杈上，就像一种新型的小鸟。几个小姑娘私下开茶会，小特迪则在各种好吃的东西之间随意地转悠。

等大家都吃不下了，教授首次正式提出干杯，在这种时候总是必要的。“为马奇姑婆干杯，愿上帝保佑她！”这位好人由衷地为她祝酒，他永远都不会忘记自己欠她很多。孩子们静默地干杯，他们一直受到教诲，要牢记她老人家。

“还有，为外婆的六十岁生日干杯！祝她老人家长寿，让我们一、二、三，欢呼三次！”

大家使劲地祝福，读者们，你们也完全会相信吧。一开始欢呼，就很难停下来。大家为每个人的健康干杯，从劳伦斯先生这位特别赞助人，到那只受惊的豚鼠，它漂泊到此来寻找小主人。戴米是长外孙，接着向寿婆婆送上各种礼物。礼物太多了，只能用独轮车送到喜庆地。有些礼物滑稽可笑，可别人的眼里的瑕疵，在外婆看来却是装饰品——因为这些孩子们的礼物都是亲手做的。戴茜耐心的小手为手帕镶了边，在马奇太太看来，其中的每一针都胜过刺绣；戴米的鞋盒是机械技术的奇迹，尽管盖子盖不上；罗布的脚凳腿不稳，歪歪扭扭，可她却说很舒服；艾美的孩子送给她的书上，歪歪斜斜地用大写字母写着几个字——“赠亲爱的外婆，您的小贝丝。”这一页是这本高价书中最漂亮的一页。

赠送仪式还在进行中，男孩们已经神秘地消失了。马奇太太想感谢孩子们，却抑制不住，放声大哭。小特迪用自己的围裙替她擦眼泪，教授突然唱起了歌。接着，从他头上，声音此起彼伏，接着歌词唱，棵棵树上隐藏着一支合唱队，歌声回荡在树木之间。男孩们由衷地唱着由乔填词、劳里谱曲的歌，教授教小家伙们以最佳的效果歌唱。总的说来，这是件新鲜事，结果取得了巨大成功。马奇太太惊喜不已，一定要跟树上那些不长羽毛的小鸟一一握手，从高大的弗朗茨和埃米尔，到那个小混血儿，他的歌声最甜美。

此后，孩子们四下散开，最后再去快活一下，留下马奇太太和女儿们还待在节日树下。

“我想，不应该再把自己叫做‘倒霉乔’了，我最大的愿望已经圆满完成。”巴尔夫人说着，一边将小特迪的小拳头拽出了牛奶罐，他的手正狂热地在罐里搅和着呢。

“可是，你的生活和很久以前想象的大相径庭。可记得我们的空中楼阁？”艾美问道。她笑看着劳里和约翰在和孩子们玩板球。

“亲爱的伙伴！看到他们忘掉事务玩耍一天，真让我的心受益匪浅。”乔回答。她现在说话带上了所有母亲的慈爱口气。“我记得的。可是，我那时向往的生活，现在看来显得自私、孤寂、清冷。然而，我并没有放弃写本好书的希望，可以等的，我确信生活里有了这样的经历和插图，书会写得更引人入胜的。”乔指着远处蹦蹦跳跳的孩子们，又指指爸爸。爸爸挽着教授的胳膊，两人在阳光下正走来走去，热烈地谈着什么，两人都乐在其中。乔接着指了指坐在那里的妈妈。女儿们众星捧月，她膝上、脚边坐着外孙儿外孙女，仿佛大家都从她脸上找到了帮助和幸福。那张脸在他们看来永远不会老。

“我的楼阁实现得最彻底啦。的确，我那时渴求美好的事物，但我心知道，假如有一个小家，有约翰和这样可爱的孩子，就应该知足了。我得到了这一切，感谢上帝。我是世上最幸福的女人。”美格将手放在人高马大的儿子的头上，脸上的表情充满温柔与虔诚的满足。

“我的楼阁和原来计划完全不同。但是，我不会像乔那样更改的。我不放弃所有的艺术希冀，也没把自己局限于帮助别人实现审美的梦想。我已经开始制作一个婴儿泥像。劳里说，那是我做得最好的一件。我自己也这么认为。打算用大理石制作。这样，不管天塌地陷，至少可以保留我的小天使的形象。”

艾美说着，一大滴泪珠落在了怀中孩子的金发上。她心肝宝贝的独生女弱不禁风，夭折的担心是艾美阳光生活中的阴影。这个磨难十字架对父亲母亲都有很大影响，同样的爱与恨把两个人紧密相连。艾美的性情变得更加甜美、深沉、温柔，劳里变得更加严肃、强壮、坚强。两个人都懂得了，美貌、青春、安康，甚至爱情本身，都不能使最有福气的人免于忧虑、疼痛、损失与悲哀，因为，“每个人生活一定有雨点落下，某些日子会变得黑暗、哀伤、凄凉”。

“她身体有起色了呢，我确信这一点，亲爱的。别灰心，要充满希望，要保持快乐。”马奇太太说道。心地温和的戴茜从外婆膝上俯过身去，将红润的脸贴在了小表妹苍白的脸颊上。

“我根本就不会灰心的，我有你鼓励，妈咪，有劳里承担一大半负担。”艾美热情地回答，“他从不让我看出他的焦虑。他对我那么温柔、耐心，对贝丝又是那么尽心。这对我始终是很大的支持与安慰，我怎么爱他都不过分。所以，尽管我有这个十字架，还是能跟着美格说：‘感谢上帝，我是个幸福的女人。'”

“我不需要再说了。大家一眼看得出来，我的幸福远远超过了我应得的。”乔接着说。她扫视了一眼好丈夫和身边草地上翻滚着的胖孩子们。“弗里茨白发越来越多，越来越胖了，而我日渐消瘦。我已经三十岁了，我们根本富不起来！梅园说不定哪天夜里会给烧掉，那个恶习不改的汤米·邦斯[5]非要在被子里面抽香蕨木烟。他已经三次烧着了自己。尽管有这样不太浪漫的事情，我无怨无悔，一辈子从来没有这样快活过。请原谅我的措辞，和那些男孩厮混，时不时要用他们的说法。”

“是的，乔，我看，你肯定会获得丰收的。”马奇太太开口说。一只黑色的大蟋蟀盯着小特迪，弄得他惊慌失措，还好，马奇太太这一说，把它吓走了。

“比您的丰收差远了，妈妈。您看，您耐心地播种，然后收获，我们怎么谢您都不够。”乔急得充满深情地大声喊道，她这个毛病永远都改不了。

“我希望每年都多些麦子，少些稗子。”艾美温柔地说。

“一大捆麦子，亲爱的妈咪，可我知道，在您心里还能装得下。”美格温情脉脉地说。

马奇太太深受感动，只能张开双臂，似乎要把儿孙们都拥抱在怀里。表情和声音里充满了慈祥的爱意、感激和谦卑，她说道：

“我的姑娘们啊，不管你们活到几岁，只要能有这么幸福，我就知足了！”

PART ONE





CHAPTER 1

PLAYING PILGRIMS


“CHRISTMAS won't be Christmas without any presents, ” grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.

“It's so dreadful to be poor! ” sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress.

“I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all, ” added little Amy, with an injured sniff.

“We've got Father and Mother, and each other, ” said Beth contentedly from her corner.

The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, “We haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time.” She didn't say “perhaps never, ” but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was.

Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, “You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't.” And Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.

“But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintram for myself.I've wanted it so long, ”said Jo, who was a bookworm.

“I planned to spend mine in new music, ” said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle holder.

“I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need them, ”said Amy decidedly.

“Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it, ” cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.

“I know I do—teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home, ” began Meg, in the complaining tone again.

“You don't have half such a hard time as I do, ” said Jo. “How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to fly out the window or cry? ”

“It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all.” And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.

“I don't believe any of you suffer as I do, ” cried Amy, “for you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.”

“If you mean libel,I'd say so,and not talk about labels,as if Papa was a pickle bottle, ” advised Jo, laughing.

“I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary, ” returned Amy, with dignity.

“Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy and good we'd be, if we had no worries! ” said Meg, who could remember better times.

“You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in spite of their money.”

“So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.”

“Jo does use such slang words! ” observed Amy, with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.

“Don't, Jo. It's so boyish! ”

“That's why I do it.”

“I detest rude, unladylike girls! ”

“I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits! ”

“Birds in their little nests agree, ” sang Beth, the peacemaker, with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the “pecking”ended for that time.

“Really, girls, you are both to be blamed, ” said Meg, beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. “You are old enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much when you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.”

“I'm not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two tails till I'm twenty, ” cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane. “I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China aster! It's bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and manners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy. And it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa, and I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman! ” And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.

“Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped. So you must try to be contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us girls, ”said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch.

“As for you, Amy, ” continued Meg, “you are altogether too particular and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.”

“If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please? ” asked Beth, ready to share the lecture.

“You're a dear, and nothing else, ” answered Meg warmly, and no one contradicted her, for the “Mouse” was the pet of the family.

As young readers like to know “how people look, ” we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable old room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses, chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.

Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth—or Beth, as everyone called her—was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her “Little Tranquility”, and the name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person—in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.

The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone brightened to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.

“They are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair.”

“I thought I'd get her some with my dollar, ” said Beth.

“No, I shall! ” cried Amy.

“I'm the oldest, ” began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided—

“I'm the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.”

“I'll tell you what we'll do, ” said Beth, “let's each get her something for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.”

“That's like you, dear! What will we get? ” exclaimed Jo.

Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, “I shall give her a nice pair of gloves.”

“Army shoes, best to be had, ” cried Jo.

“Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed, ” said Beth.

“I'll get a little bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it won't cost much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils, ” added Amy.

“How will we give the things? ” asked Meg.

“Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles. Don't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays? ” answered Jo.

“I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles, ” said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time.

“Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise her. We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night, ” said Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.

“I don't mean to act any more after this time. I'm getting too old for such things, ” observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about“dressing-up” frolics.

“You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best actress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the boards, ” said Jo. “We ought to rehearse tonight. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.”

“I can't help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose to make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down easily, I'll drop. If I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be graceful. I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol, ” returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.

“Do it this way: clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room, crying frantically, ‘Roderigo! save me! save me! '” and away went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.

Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her “Ow! ” was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest.

“It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don't blame me. Come on, Meg.”

Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break. Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect. Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild “Ha! Ha! ”

“It's the best we've had yet, ” said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows.

“I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You're a regular Shakespeare! ” exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.

“Not quite, ”replied Jo modestly.“I do think The Witch's Curse,an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing,but I'd like to try Macbeth,if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing part.‘Is that a dagger that I see before me? '” muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.

“No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead of the bread. Beth's stage-struck! ” cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter.

“Glad to find you so merry, my girls, ” said a cheery voice at the door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a “can-I-help-you” look about her which was truly delightful. She was not elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world.

“Well, dearies, how have you got on today? There was so much to do, getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home to dinner. Has anyone called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look tired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.”

While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched. Beth trotted to and fro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.

As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly happy face, “I've got a treat for you after supper.”

A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her napkin, crying, “A letter! A letter! Three cheers for Father! ”

“Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls, ” said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.

“Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate, Amy, ” cried Jo, choking in her tea and dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.

Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready.

“I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier, ” said Meg warmly.

“Don't I wish I could go as a drummer,a vivan—what's its name?Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help him, ” exclaimed Jo, with a groan.

“It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug, ” sighed Amy.

“When will he come home, Marmee? ” asked Beth, with a little quiver in her voice.

“Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.”

They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching. Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news, and only at the end did the writer's heart over-flow with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.

“Give them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women.”

Everybody sniffed when they came to that part. Jo wasn't ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother's shoulder and sobbed out, “I am a selfish girl! But I'll truly try to be better, so he mayn't be disappointed in me by-and-by.”

“We all will! ” cried Meg. “I think too much of my looks and hate to work, but won't any more, if I can help it.”

“I'll try and be what he loves to call me, ‘a little woman, ' and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else, ” said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.

Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home.

Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her cheery voice, “Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim's Progress when you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a Celestial City.”

“What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and passing through the Valley where the hobgoblins were! ” said Jo.

“I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs, ”said Meg.

“My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our flowers and arbors and pretty things were, and all stood and sung for joy up there in the sunshine, ” said Beth, smiling, as if that pleasant moment had come back to her.

“I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it over again, ” said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve.

“We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get before Father comes home.”

“Really, Mother? Where are our bundles? ” asked Amy, who was a very literal young lady.

“Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather think she hasn't got any, ” said her mother.

“Yes, I have. Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice pianos, and being afraid of people.”

Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.

“Let us do it, ” said Meg thoughtfully. “It is only another name for trying to be good, and the story may help us; for though we do want to be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do our best.”

“We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled us out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions, like Christian. What shall we do about that? ” asked Jo, delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty.

“Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your guidebook, ” replied Mrs. March.

They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then out came the four little workbaskets, and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but tonight no one grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long seams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them.

At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed. No one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. Meg had a voice like a flute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could lisp





Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,





and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer. The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby.





CHAPTER 2

A MERRY CHRISTMAS


JO WAS the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. Then she remembered her mother's promise and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey. She woke Meg with a “Merry Christmas, ”and bade her see what was under her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day.

In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature, which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.

“Girls, ” said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little nightcapped ones in the room beyond, “Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used to be faithful about it, but since Father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you please, but I shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through the day.”

Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.

“How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the hard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand, ”whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters' example.

“I'm glad mine is blue, ” said Amy. And then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.

“Where is Mother? ” asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later.

“Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter came a-beggin', and your ma went straight off to see what was needed.There never was such a woman for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin', ” replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.

“She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have everything ready, ” said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.“Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne? ” she added, as the little flask did not appear.

“She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on it, or some such notion, ” replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.

“How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed them for me, and I marked them all myself, ” said Beth, looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.

“Bless the child! She's gone and put ‘Mother' on them instead of ‘M. March'. How funny! ” cried Jo, taking one up.

“Isn't that right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use these but Marmee, ” said Beth, looking troubled.

“It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know, ” said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.

“There's Mother. Hide the basket, quick! ” cried Jo, as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall.

Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her.

“Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you? ” asked Meg, surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so early.

“Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean anyone should know till the time came.I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one,and I gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any more.”

As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her “a trump”, while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle.

“You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest now.”

Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa, and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.

“Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books. We read some, and mean to every day, ” they all cried in chorus.

“Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present? ”

They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a minute no one spoke—only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously, “I'm so glad you came before we began! ”

“May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children? ” asked Beth eagerly.

“I shall take the cream and the muffins, ” added Amy, heroically giving up the article she most liked.

Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one big plate.

“I thought you'd do it, ” said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. “You shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime.”

They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and no one laughed at the queer party.

A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.

How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!

“Ach,mein Gott!It is good angels come to us! ”said the poor woman, crying for joy.

“Funny angels in hoods and mittens, ” said Jo, and set them laughing.

In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The girls meantime spread the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing, talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.

“Das ist gut!”“Die Engel-kinder! ”cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.

The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a “Sancho” ever since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't get any of it. And when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning.

“That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it, ”said Meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.

Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles, and the tall vase of red roses, white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave quite an elegant air to the table.

“She's coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for Marmee! ” cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to conduct Mother to the seat of honor.

Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were pronounced “a perfect fit”.

There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to work.

The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out. The big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.

No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart's content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions. The smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.

On Christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment.Presently a bell sounded,the curtains flew apart,and the Operatic Tragedy began.

“A gloomy wood, ” according to the one playbill, was represented by a few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the distance. This cave was made with a clotheshorse for a roof, bureaus for walls, and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with a clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black beard, mysterious cloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his hatred for Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive, and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern and ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding, “What ho, minion! I need thee! ”

Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter.





Hither, hither, from thy home,

Airy sprite, I bid thee come!

Born of roses, fed on dew,

Charms and potions canst thou brew?

Bring me here, with elfin speed,

The fragrant philter which I need.

Make it sweet and swift and strong,

Spirit, answer now my song!





A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering wings, golden hair, and a garland of roses on its head. Waving a wand, it sang,





Hither I come,

From my airy home,

Afar in the silver moon.

Take the magic spell,

And use it well,

Or its power will vanish soon!





And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the spirit vanished. Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition, not a lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh. Having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed him, and intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him. Then the curtain fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play.

A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again, but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentering had been got up, no one murmured at the delay. It was truly superb! A tower rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning at it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in a lovely blue and silver dress, waiting for Roderigo. He came in gorgeous array, with plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a guitar, and the boots, of course. Kneeling at the foot of the tower, he sang a serenade in melting tones. Zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. Then came the grand effect of the play. Roderigo produced a rope ladder, with five steps to it, threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend. Timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when“Alas! Alas for Zara! ” she forgot her train. It caught in the window, the tower tottered, leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins!

A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, “I told you so! I told you so! ” With wonderful presence of mind, Don Pedro, the cruel sire, rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty aside—

“Don't laugh! Act as if it was all right! ”—and, ordering Roderigo up, banished him from the kingdom with wrath and scorn. Though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him, Roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir. This dauntless example fired Zara: she also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle. A stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made.

Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having come to free the lovers and finish Hugo. She hears him coming and hides, sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the timid little servant,“Bear them to the captives in their cells, and tell them I shall come anon.”The servant takes Hugo aside to tell him something, and Hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless. Ferdinando, the “minion”, carries them away, and Hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo. Hugo, getting thirsty after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits, and after a good deal of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies, while Hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody.

This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the villain's death. He was called before the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar, whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together.

Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him. Just as the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his window, informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can save her if he will. A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door, and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his ladylove.

Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro. He wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it, and after a touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in and demands her hand. Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich. They shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and Rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously disappeared. The latter informs the party that she bequeaths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if he doesn't make them happy. The bag is opened, and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter. This entirely softens the “stern sire”. He consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace.

Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check, for the cot bed, on which the “dress circle” was built, suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience. Roderigo and Don Pedro flew to the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless with laughter. The excitement had hardly subsided when Hannah appeared, with “Mrs. March's compliments, and would the ladies walk down to supper.”

This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table, they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. It was like Marmee to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty. There was ice cream, actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and fruit and distracting French bonbons and, in the middle of the table, four great bouquets of hothouse flowers.

It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely.

“Is it fairies? ” asked Amy.

“It's Santa Claus, ” said Beth.

“Mother did it.” And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows.

“Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper, ” cried Jo, with a sudden inspiration.

“All wrong. Old Mr. Laurence sent it, ” replied Mrs. March.

“The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a thing into his head? We don't know him! ” exclaimed Meg.

“Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party. He is an odd old gentleman, but that pleased him. He knew my father years ago, and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day. I could not refuse, and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the bread-and-milk breakfast.”

“That boy put it into his head, I know he did! He's a capital fellow, and I wish we could get acquainted. He looks as if he'd like to know us but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let me speak to him when we pass, ” said Jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.

“You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't you? ” asked one of the girls. “My mother knows old Mr. Laurence, but says he's very proud and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors. He keeps his grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with his tutor, and makes him study very hard. We invited him to our party, but he didn't come. Mother says he's very nice, though he never speaks to us girls.”

“Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we talked over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some day, for he needs fun, I'm sure he does, ” said Jo decidedly.

“I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so I've no objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. He brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if I had been sure what was going on upstairs. He looked so wistful as he went away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own.”

“It's a mercy you didn't, Mother! ” laughed Jo, looking at her boots.“But we'll have another play sometime that he can see. Perhaps he'll help act. Wouldn't that be jolly? ”

“I never had such a fine bouquet before! How pretty it is! ” And Meg examined her flowers with great interest.

“They are lovely. But Beth's roses are sweeter to me, ”said Mrs. March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.

Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, “I wish I could send my bunch to Father. I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we are.”





CHAPTER 3

THE LAURENCE BOY


“JO! JO! Where are you? ” cried Meg at the foot of the garret stairs.

“Here! ” answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window. This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news.

“Such fun! Only see! A regular note of invitation from Mrs. Gardiner for tomorrow night! ” cried Meg, waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.

“‘Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine at a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go,now what shall we wear? ”

“What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear our poplins, because we haven't got anything else? ” answered Jo with her mouth full.

“If I only had a silk! ” sighed Meg. “Mother says I may when I'm eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait.”

“I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for us. Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine. Whatever shall I do? The burn shows badly, and I can't take any out.”

“You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight. The front is all right. I shall have a new ribbon for my hair, and Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are lovely, and my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like.”

“Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones, so I shall have to go without, ” said Jo, who never troubled herself much about dress.

“You must have gloves, or I won't go, ” cried Meg decidedly. “Gloves are more important than anything else. You can't dance without them, and if you don't I should be so mortified.”

“Then I'll stay still. I don't care much for company dancing. It's no fun to go sailing round. I like to fly about and cut capers.”

“You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and you are so careless. She said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn't get you any more this winter. Can't you make them do? ” asked Meg anxiously.

“I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained they are. That's all I can do. No! I'll tell you how we can manage—each wear one good one and carry a bad one. Don't you see? ”

“Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove dreadfully, ” began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.

“Then I'll go without. I don't care what people say! ” cried Jo, taking up her book.

“You may have it, you may! Only don't stain it, and do behave nicely. Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say ‘Christopher Columbus! ' will you? ”

“Don't worry about me. I'll be as prim as I can and not get into any scrapes, if I can help it. Now go and answer your note, and let me finish this splendid story.”

So Meg went away to “accept with thanks, ” look over her dress, and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo finished her story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with Scrabble.

On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the all-important business of “getting ready for the party.” Simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.

“Ought they to smoke like that? ” asked Beth from her perch on the bed.

“It's the dampness drying, ” replied Jo.

“What a queer smell! It's like burned feathers, ” observed Amy, smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.

“There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud of little ringlets, ” said Jo, putting down the tongs.

She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.

“Oh, oh, oh! What have you done? I'm spoiled! I can't go! My hair, oh, my hair! ” wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead.

“Just my luck! You shouldn't have asked me to do it. I always spoil everything. I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and so I've made a mess, ” groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret.

“It isn't spoiled; just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. I've seen many girls do it so, ” said Amy consolingly.

“Serves me right for trying to be fine. I wish I'd let my hair alone, ”cried Meg petulantly.

“So do I, it was so smooth and pretty. But it will soon grow out again, ”said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.

After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and her dress on. They looked very well in their simple suits, Meg's in silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin. Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect “quite easy and fine.” Meg's high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.

“Have a good time, dearies! ” said Mrs. March, as the sisters went daintily down the walk. “Don't eat much supper, and come away at eleven when I send Hannah for you.” As the gate clashed behind them, a voice cried from a window—

“Girls, girls! Have you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs? ”

“Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers, ” cried Jo, adding with a laugh as they went on, “I do believe Marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake.”

“It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief, ” replied Meg, who had a good many little “aristocratic tastes” of her own.

“Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo. Is my sash right? And does my hair look very bad? ” said Meg, as she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after a prolonged prink.

“I know I shall forget. If you see me doing anything wrong, just remind me by a wink, will you? ” returned Jo, giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush.

“No, winking isn't ladylike. I'll lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong, and nod if you are all right. Now hold your shoulder straight, and take short steps, and don't shake hands if you are introduced to anyone. It isn't the thing.”

“How do you learn all the proper ways? I never can. Isn't that music gay? ”

Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life. She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone. She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly. Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face to face with the “Laurence boy”.

“Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here! ” stammered Jo, preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.

But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little startled, “Don't mind me, stay if you like.”

“Shan't I disturb you? ”

“Not a bit. I only came here because I don't know many people and felt rather strange at first, you know.”

“So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.”

The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to be polite and easy, “I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before. You live near us, don't you? ”

“Next door.” And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home.

That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her heartiest way, “We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.”

“Grandpa sent it.”

“But you put it into his head, didn't you, now? ”

“How is your cat, Miss March? ” asked the boy, trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun.

“Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo, ” returned the young lady.

“I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.”

“Laurie Laurence—what an odd name! ”

“My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.”

“I hate my name, too—so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora? ”

“I thrashed 'em.”

“I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.” And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.

“Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo? ” asked Laurie, looking as if he thought the name suited her.

“I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is lively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and let Meg sail about. Don't you dance? ”

“Sometimes. You see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.”

“Abroad! ” cried Jo. “Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people describe their travels.”

Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager questions soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers.

“Don't I wish I'd been there! ” cried Jo. “Did you go to Paris? ”

“We spent last winter there.”

“Can you talk French? ”

“We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.”

“Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce.”

“Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis? ”said Laurie good-naturely.

“How nicely you do it! Let me see ... you said, ‘Who is the young lady in the pretty slippers, ' didn't you? ”

“Oui, mademoiselle.”

“It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is pretty? ”

“Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and quiet, and dances like a lady.”

Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the “Laurence boy” better than ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.

“Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose, fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite, for a boy, and altogether jolly. Wonder how old he is? ”

It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked herself in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way.

“I suppose you are going to college soon? I see you pegging away at your books, no, I mean studying hard.” And Jo blushed at the dreadful“pegging” which had escaped her.

Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a shrug.“Not for a year or two. I won't go before seventeen, anyway.”

“Aren't you but fifteen? ” asked Jo, looking at the tall lad, whom she had imagined seventeen already.

“Sixteen, next month.”

“How I wish I was going to college! You don't look as if you liked it.”

“I hate it! Nothing but grinding or skylarking. And I don't like the way fellows do either, in this country.”

“What do you like? ”

“To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way.”

Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, “That's a splendid polka! Why don't you go and try it? ”

“If you will come too, ” he answered, with a gallant little bow.

“I can't; for I told Meg I wouldn't, because—” There Jo stopped, and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.

“Because, what? ” asked Laurie curiously.

“You won't tell? ”

“Never! ”

“Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would see it. You may laugh, if you want to. It is funny, I know.”

But Laurie didn't laugh. He only looked down a minute, and the expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently, “Never mind that; I'll tell you how we can manage: there's a long hall out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us. Please come.”

Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore. The hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well, and taught her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of swing and spring. When the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account of a students' festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of her sister. She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into a side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and looking pale.

“I've sprained my ankle. That stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench. It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't know how I'm ever going to get home, ” she said, rocking to and fro in pain.

“I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes. I'm sorry. But I don't see what you can do, except get a carriage, or stay here all night, ”answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke.

“I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much. I dare say I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own, and it's a long way to the stable, and no one to send.”

“I'll go.”

“No, indeed! It's past nine, and dark as Egypt. I can't stop here, for the house is full. Sallie has some girls staying with her. I'll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can.”

“I'll ask Laurie; he will go, ” said Jo, looking relieved as the idea occurred to her.

“Mercy, no! Don't ask or tell anyone. Get me my rubbers, and put these slippers with our things. I can't dance anymore, but as soon as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she comes.”

“They are going out to supper now. I'll stay with you. I'd rather.”

“No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee. I'm so tired, I can't stir.”

So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering away to the dining room, which she found after going into a china closet, and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner was taking a little private refreshment. Making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.

“Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am! ” exclaimed Jo, finishing Meg's glove by scrubbing her gown with it.

“Can I help you? ” said a friendly voice. And there was Laurie, with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.

“I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and someone shook me, and here I am in a nice state, ” answered Jo, glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.

“Too bad! I was looking for someone to give this to. May I take it to your sister? ”

“Oh, thank you! I'll show you where she is. I don't offer to take it myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did.”

Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie drew up a little table, brought a second installment of coffee and ice for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced him a “nice boy”. They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the midst of a quiet game of “Buzz”, with two or three other young people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared. Meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of Jo, with an exclamation of pain.

“Hush! Don't say anything, ” she whispered, adding aloud, “It's nothing. I turned my foot a little, that's all, ” and limped upstairs to put her things on.

Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till she decided to take things into her own hands. Slipping out, she ran down and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage. It happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had heard what she said, came up and offered his grandfather's carriage, which had just come for him, he said.

“It's so early! You can't mean to go yet? ” began Jo, looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.

“I always go early—I do, truly! Please let me take you home. It's all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say.”

That settled it; and, telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party. Hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and elegant. Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot up, and the girls talked over their party in freedom.

“I had a capital time. Did you? ” asked Jo, rumpling up her hair, and making herself comfortable.

“Yes, till I hurt myself. Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took a fancy to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when Sallie does. She is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go, ” answered Meg, cheering up at the thought.

“I saw you dancing with the redheaded man I ran away from. Was he nice? ”

“Oh, very! His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very polite, and I had a delicious redowa with him.”

“He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step. Laurie and I couldn't help laughing. Did you hear us? ”

“No,but it was very rude.What were you about all that time,hidden away there? ”

Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at home. With many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out—

“Tell about the party! Tell about the party! ”

With what Meg called “a great want of manners, ” Jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls; and they soon subsided, after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening.

“I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me, ” said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair.

“I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them.”And I think Jo was quite right.





CHAPTER 4

BURDENS


“OH, DEAR, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on, ”sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked.

“I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time. Wouldn't it be fun? ” answered Jo, yawning dismally.

“We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now. But it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. It's like other people, you know, and I always envy girls who do such things, I'm so fond of luxury, ”said Meg, trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby.

“Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as Marmee does. I'm sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've learned to carry her without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so light that I shan't mind her.”

This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits, but Meg didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting of four spoiled children, seemed heavier than ever. She had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way.

“Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty or not? ” she muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk. “I shall have to toil and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly and sour, because I'm poor and can't enjoy my life as other girls do. It's a shame! ”

So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at all agreeable at breakfast time. Everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak. Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens. Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned, and she couldn't find her rubbers. Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready; Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn't suit her.

“There never was such a cross family! ” cried Jo, losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot lacings, and sat down upon her hat.

“You're the crossest person in it! ” returned Amy, washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate.

“Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar I'll have them drowned, ” exclaimed Meg angrily, as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach.

Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed because she couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.

“Girls,girls,do be quiet one minute!I must get this off by the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your worry, ” cried Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter.

There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in, laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. These turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them “muffs”, for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings. Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. The poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two.

“Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Beth. Goodbye, Marmee. We are a set of rascals this morning, but we'll come home regular angels. Now then, Meg! ” And Jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do.

They always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them. Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't have got through the day without that, for whatever their mood might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine.

“If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen, ”cried Jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind.

“Don't use such dreadful expressions, ” replied Meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world.

“I like good strong words that mean something, ” replied Jo, catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether.

“Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a rascal nor a wretch and I don't choose to be called so.”

“You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can't sit in the lap of luxury all the time. Poor dear, just wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red headed boys to dance with.”

“How ridiculous you are, Jo! ” But Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself.

“Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state. Thank goodness, I can always find something funny to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but come home jolly, there's a dear.”

Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.

When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support, at least. Believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last. Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary. As she said, she was “fond of luxury”, and her chief trouble was poverty. She found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure, and want of any kind unknown. She tried not to be envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. At the Kings' she daily saw all she wanted, for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her. Poor Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy.

Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. The childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her offer was declined. Other friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady's will, but the unworldly Marches only said—

“We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. Rich or poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another.”

The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening to meet Jo at a friend's, something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old lady's fancy, and she proposed to take her for a companion. This did not suit Jo at all, but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well with her irascible relative. There was an occasional tempest, and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn't bear it longer; but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.

I suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books, which was left to dust and spiders since Uncle March died. Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries, tell her stories about queer pictures in his Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street. The dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her. The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself up in the easy chair, devoured poetry, romance, history, travels, and pictures like a regular bookworm. But, like all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of a song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a shrill voice called, “Josy-phine! Josy-phine! ” and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle,or read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.

Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid. What it was, she had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell her, and meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the fact that she couldn't read, run, and ride as much as she liked. A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic. But the training she received at Aunt March's was just what she needed, and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual “Josy-phine! ”

Beth was too bashful to go to school. It had been tried, but she suffered so much that it was given up, and she did her lessons at home with her father. Even when he went away, and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could. She was a housewifely little creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be loved. Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she was by nature a busy bee. There were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning, for Beth was a child still and loved her pets as well as ever. Not one whole or handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took them in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly. Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. No pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh words or blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the heart of the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed, nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed.One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and,having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in the rag bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth and taken to her refuge. Having no top to its head, she tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid. If anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly, I think it would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed. She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it out to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang it lullabies and never went to bed without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly, “I hope you'll have a good night, my poor dear.”

Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but a very human little girl, she often “wept a little weep, ” as Jo said, because she couldn't take music lessons and have a fine piano. She loved music so dearly, tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her. Nobody did, however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn't keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about her work, never was too tired for Marmee and the girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself, “I know I'll get my music some time, if I'm good.”

There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.

If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her life was, she would have answered at once, “My nose.” When she was a baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod, and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever. It was not big nor red, like poor “Petrea's”, it was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. No one minded it but herself, and it was doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself.

“Little Raphael, ” as her sisters called her, had a decided talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying flowers, designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art. Her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals, the blank pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on, and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments. She got through her lessons as well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment. She was a great favorite with her mates, being good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort. Her little airs and graces were much admired, so were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without mispronouncing more than two-thirds of the words. She had a plaintive way of saying, “When Papa was rich we did so-and-so, ” which was very touching, and her long words were considered “perfectly elegant” by the girls.

Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities. She had to wear her cousin's clothes. Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of taste, and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's artistic eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming.

“My only comfort, ” she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes, “is that Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm naughty, as Maria Parks' mother does. My dear, it's really dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can't come to school. When I think of this deggerredation,I feel that I can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it.”

Meg was Amy's confidante and monitor, and by some strange attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth's. To Jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts; and over her big harum-scarum sister Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family. The two older girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way— “playing mother”they called it—and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women.

“Has anybody got anything to tell? It's been such a dismal day I'm really dying for some amusement, ” said Meg, as they sat sewing together that evening.

“I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best of it, I'll tell you about it, ” began Jo, who dearly loved to tell stories. “I was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning away as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. I actually made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once.”

“I wish I could, and be done with it, ” said I, trying not to be saucy.

“Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to sit and think them over while she just ‘lost' herself for a moment. She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a top-heavy dahlia,I whipped the Vicar of Wakefield out of my pocket,and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt. I'd just got to where they all tumbled into the water when I forgot and laughed out loud. Aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham. I did my very best, and she liked it, though she only said—

“‘I don't understand what it's all about. Go back and begin it, child.'

“Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I could. Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place, and say meekly, ‘I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am. Shan't I stop now? '

“She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way, ‘Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss.'”

“Did she own she liked it? ” asked Meg.

“Oh, bless you, no! But she let old Belsham rest, and when I ran back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the Vicar that she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming. What a pleasant life she might have if only she chose! I don't envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I think, ” added Jo.

“That reminds me, ” said Meg, “that I've got something to tell. It isn't funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal as I came home. At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry, and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away. I heard Mrs. King crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red and swollen their eyes were. I didn't ask any questions, of course, but I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn't any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family.”

“I think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do, ” said Amy, shaking her head, as if her experience of life had been a deep one. “Susie Perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring. I wanted it dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might. Well, she drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump, and the words, ‘Young ladies, my eye is upon you! ' coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing. We were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up her slate. She was parrylized with fright,but she went,and oh,what do you think he did? He took her by the ear—the ear! Just fancy how horrid! —and led her to the recitation platform, and made her stand there half an hour, holding the slate so everyone could see.”

“Didn't the girls laugh at the picture? ” asked Jo, who relished the scrape.

“Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried quarts, I know she did. I didn't envy her then, for I felt that millions of carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy after that. I never, never should have got over such a agonizing mortification.” And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.

“I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it at dinner,but I forgot, ” said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket in order as she talked. “When I went to get some oysters for Hannah, Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop; but he didn't see me, for I kept behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fishman. A poor woman came in with a pail and a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she hadn't any dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a day's work. Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said ‘No', rather crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr. Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her. She was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms, and thanked him over and over. He told her to ‘go along and cook it', and she hurried off, so happy! Wasn't it good of him? Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be ‘aisy'.”

When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother for one, and after a moment's thought, she said soberly, “As I sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything happened to him. It was not a wise thing to do, but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes. He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, for he looked poor and tired and anxious.

“‘Have you sons in the army? ' I asked, for the note he brought was not to me.

“‘Yes, ma'am. I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital, ' he answered quietly.

“‘You have done a great deal for your country, sir, ' I said, feeling respect now, instead of pity.

“‘Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am. I'd go myself, if I was any use. As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'

“He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself. I'd given one man and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them. I had all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting, miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps! I felt so rich, so happy thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him some money, and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me.”

“Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this. I like to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy, ” said Jo, after a minute's silence.

Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.

“Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented.” (Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew diligently.)“These girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were constantly saying, ‘If only we had this, ' or ‘If we could only do that, ' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many things they actually could do. So they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy, and she said,‘When you feel discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.'”(Here Jo looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing that the story was not done yet.)

“Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon were surprised to see how well off they were. One discovered that money couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses; another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts; a third that, disagreeable as it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for it; and the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior. So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken away entirely, instead of increased; and I believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman's advice.”

“Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance! ” cried Meg.

“I like that kind of sermon. It's the sort Father used to tell us, ” said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's cushion.

“I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be more careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susie's downfall, ” said Amy morally.

“We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it. If we do so, you just say to us,as old Chloe did in Uncle Tom,‘Tink ob yer marcies,chillen! Tink ob yer marcies! '” added Jo, who could not, for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon, though she took it to heart as much as any of them.





CHAPTER 5

BEING NEIGHBORLY


“WHAT IN the world are you going to do now, Jo? ” asked Meg one snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through the hall, in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other.

“Going out for exercise, ” answered Jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.

“I should think two long walks this morning would have been enough! It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire, as I do, ” said Meg with a shiver.

“Never take advice! Can't keep still all day, and not being a pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire. I like adventures, and I'm going to find some.”

Meg went back to toast her feet and read Ivanhoe, and Jo began to dig paths with great energy. The snow was light, and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air. Now, the garden separated the Marches' house from that of Mr. Laurence. Both stood in a suburb of the city, which was still country-like, with groves and lawns, large gardens, and quiet streets. A low hedge parted the two estates. On one side was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers, which then surrounded it. On the other side was a stately stone mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.

Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.

To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed. She had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the “Laurence boy”, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only knew how to begin. Since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him; but he had not been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snowballing one another.

“That boy is suffering for society and fun, ” she said to herself. “His grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up all alone. He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody young and lively. I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so! ”

The idea amused Jo, who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of “going over”was not forgotten. And when the snowy afternoon came, Jo resolved to try what could be done. She saw Mr. Lawrence drive off, and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she paused and took a survey. All quiet—curtains down at the lower windows, servants out of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.

“There he is, ” thought Jo, “Poor boy! All alone and sick this dismal day. It's a shame! I'll toss up a snowball and make him look out, and then say a kind word to him.”

Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once, showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile. Jo nodded and laughed, and flourished her broom as she called out—

“How do you do? Are you sick? ”

Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven—

“Better, thank you. I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.”

“I'm sorry. What do you amuse yourself with? ”

“Nothing. It's dull as tombs up here.”

“Don't you read? ”

“Not much. They won't let me.”

“Can't somebody read to you? ”

“Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him, and I hate to ask Brooke all the time.”

“Have someone come and see you, then.”

“There isn't anyone I'd like to see. Boys make such a row, and my head is weak.”

“Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you? Girls are quiet and like to play nurse.”

“Don't know any.”

“You know us, ” began Jo, then laughed and stopped.

“So I do! Will you come, please? ” cried Laurie.

“I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me. I'll go ask her. Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till I come.”

With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house, wondering what they would all say to her. Laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get ready;for as Mrs. March said, he was “a little gentleman”, and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a fresh color, and trying to tidy up the room, which in spite of half a dozen servants, was anything but neat. Presently there came a loud ring, than a decided voice, asking for“Mr. Laurie”, and a surprised-looking servant came running up to announce a young lady.

“All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo, ” said Laurie, going to the door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three kittens in the other.

“Here I am, bag and baggage, ” she said briskly. “Mother sent her love, and was glad if I could do anything for you. Meg wanted me to bring some of her blancmange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought her cats would be comforting. I knew you'd laugh at them, but I couldn't refuse, she was so anxious to do something.”

It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for in laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew sociable at once.

“That looks too pretty to eat, ” he said, smiling with pleasure, as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blancmange, surrounded by a garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.

“It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it. Tell the girl to put it away for your tea. It's so simple you can eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore throat. What a cozy room this is! ”

“It might be if it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and I don't know how to make them mind. It worries me, though.”

“I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the hearth brushed, so—and the things made straight on the mantelpiece, so—and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit. Now, then, you're fixed.”

And so he was; for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room. Laurie watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his sofa, he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully—

“How kind you are! Yes, that's what it wanted. Now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company.”

“No, I came to amuse you. Shall I read aloud? ” and Jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by.

“Thank you! I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd rather talk, ”answered Laurie.

“Not a bit. I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going. Beth says I never know when to stop.”

“Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home a good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket? ” asked Laurie with interest.

“Yes, that's Beth. She's my girl, and a regular good one she is, too.”

“The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe? ”

“How did you find that out? ”

Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, “Why, you see I often hear you calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such good times. I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are. And when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother. Her face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, I can't help watching it. I haven't got any mother, you know.” And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control.

The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's warm heart. She had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head,and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child. Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich she was in home love and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him. Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said—

“We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave to look as much as you like. I just wish, though, instead of peeping, you'd come over and see us. Mother is so splendid, she'd do you heaps of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would dance. Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we'd have jolly times. Wouldn't your grandpa let you? ”

“I think he would, if your mother asked him. He's very kind, though he does not look so; and he lets me do what I like, pretty much, only he's afraid I might be a bother to strangers, ” began Laurie, brightening more and more.

“We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be a bother.We want to know you,and I've been trying to do it this ever so long. We haven't been here a great while, you know, but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you.”

“You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much what happens outside. Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here, you know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home and get on as I can.”

“That's bad. You ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go to. Never mind being bashful. It won't last long if you keep going.”

Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused of bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant.

“Do you like your school? ” asked the boy, changing the subject, after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo looked about her, well pleased.

“Don't go to school; I'm a businessman—girl, I mean. I go to wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too, ” answered Jo.

Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering just in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into people's affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable. Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the library where she reveled. Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and, in the middle of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter.

“Oh! That does me no end of good. Tell on, please, ” he said, taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining with merriment.

Much elated with her success, Jo did “tell on, ” all about their plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived. Then they got to talking about books, and to Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she did, and had read even more than herself.

“If you like them so much, come down and see ours. Grandfather is out, so you needn't be afraid, ” said Laurie, getting up.

“I'm not afraid of anything, ” returned Jo, with a toss of the head.

“I don't believe you are! ” exclaimed the boy, looking at her with much admiration, though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she met him in some of his moods.

The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie led the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy. And so, at last they came to the library, where she clapped her hands and pranced, as she always did when especially delighted. It was lined with books, and there were pictures and statues, and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables, and bronzes, and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it.

“What richness! ” sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velvet chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. “Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world, ” she added impressively.

“A fellow can't live on books, ” said Laurie, shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite.

Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming with alarm, “Mercy me! It's your grandpa! ”

“Well, what if it is? You are not afraid of anything, you know, ”returned the boy, looking wicked.

“I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know why I should be. Marmee said I might come, and I don't think you're any the worse for it, ” said Jo, composing herself, though she kept her eyes on the door.

“I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only afraid you are very tired of talking to me.It was so pleasant,I couldn't bear to stop, ” said Laurie gratefully.

“The doctor to see you, sir, ” and the maid beckoned as she spoke.

“Would you mind if I left you for a minute? I suppose I must see him, ”said Laurie.

“Don't mind me. I'm happy as a cricket here, ” answered Jo.

Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way. She was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, “I'm sure now that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes, though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own. He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like him.”

“Thank you, ma'am, ” said a gruff voice behind her, and there, to her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.

Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could. A second look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, “So you're not afraid of me, hey? ”

“Not much, sir.”

“And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather? ”

“Not quite, sir.”

“And I've got a tremendous will, have I? ”

“I only said I thought so.”

“But you like me in spite of it? ”

“Yes, I do, sir.”

That answer pleased the old gentleman. He gave a short laugh, shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod, “You've got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face. He was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and I was proud to be his friend.”

“Thank you, sir, ” And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited her exactly.

“What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey? ” was the next question, sharply put.

“Only trying to be neighborly, sir.” And Jo told how her visit came about.

“You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you? ”

“Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do him good perhaps. We are only girls, but we should be glad to help if we could, for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present you sent us, ” said Jo eagerly.

“Tut, tut, tut! That was the boy's affair. How is the poor woman? ”

“Doing nicely, sir.” And off went Jo, talking very fast, as she told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were.

“Just her father's way of doing good. I shall come and see your mother some fine day. Tell her so. There's the tea bell, we have it early on the boy's account. Come down and go on being neighborly.”

“If you'd like to have me, sir.”

“Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't.” And Mr. Laurence offered her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.

“What would Meg say to this? ” thought Jo, as she was marched away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home.

“Hey! Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow? ” said the old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astonishing sight of Jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather.

“I didn't know you'd come, sir, ” he began, as Jo gave him a triumphant little glance.

“That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs. Come to your tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman.” And having pulled the boy's hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs, which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.

The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea,but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him. There was color, light, and life in the boy's face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.

“She's right,the lad is lonely.I'll see what these little girls can do for him, ” thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and listened. He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself.

If the Laurences had been what Jo called “prim and poky”, she would not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good impression. When they rose she proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full. Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, “Please give these to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much.”

They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room, but Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano, which stood open.

“Do you play? ” she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful expression.

“Sometimes, ” he answered modestly.

“Please do now. I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth.”

“Won't you first? ”

“Don't know how. Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly.”

So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses. Her respect and regard for the “Laurence boy”increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn't put on any airs. She wished Beth could hear him, but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue. “That will do, that will do, young lady. Too many sugarplums are not good for him. His music isn't bad, but I hope he will do as well in more important things. Going? well, I'm much obliged to you, and I hope you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor Jo.”

He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not please him. When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she had said something amiss. He shook his head.

“No, it was me. He doesn't like to hear me play.”

“Why not? ”

“I'll tell you some day. John is going home with you, as I can't.”

“No need of that. I am not a young lady, and it's only a step. Take care of yourself, won't you? ”

“Yes, but you will come again, I hope? ”

“If you promise to come and see us after you are well.”

“I will.”

“Good night, Laurie! ”

“Good night, Jo, good night! ”

When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge. Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth sighed for the grand piano, and Amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues.

“Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play? ” asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.

“I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the old man, who is very proud. The lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after he married. They both died when Laurie was a little child, and then his grandfather took him home. I fancy the boy, who was born in Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing him, which makes him so careful. Laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. At any rate, his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he ‘glowered' as Jo said.”

“Dear me, how romantic! ” exclaimed Meg.

“How silly! ” said Jo. “Let him be a musician if he wants to, and not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go.”

“That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, I suppose. Italians are always nice, ” said Meg, who was a little sentimental.

“What do you know about his eyes and his manners? You never spoke to him, hardly, ” cried Jo, who was not sentimental.

“I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave. That was a nice little speech about the medicine Mother sent him.”

“He meant the blancmange, I suppose.”

“How stupid you are, child! He meant you, of course.”

“Did he? ” And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before.

“I never saw such a girl! You don't know a compliment when you get it, ” said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter.

“I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun. Laurie's a nice boy and I like him, and I won't have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. We'll all be good to him because he hasn't got any mother,and he may come over and see us, mayn't he, Marmee? ”

“Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can.”

“I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet, ” observed Amy. “What do you say, Beth? ”

“I was thinking about our ‘Pilgrim's Progress', ” answered Beth, who had not heard a word. “How we got out of the Slough and through the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by trying, and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things, is going to be our Palace Beautiful.”

“We have got to get by the lions first, ” said Jo, as if she rather liked the prospect.





CHAPTER 6

BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL


THE BIG HOUSE did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took some time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass the lions. Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he had called, said something funny or kind to each one of the girls, and talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much afraid of him, except timid Beth. The other lion was the fact that they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return. But, after a while, they found that he considered them the benefactors, and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs. So they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater.

All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring. Every one liked Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that “the Marches were regularly splendid girls.”With the delightful enthusiasm of youth, they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him, and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship of these simple-hearted girls. Never having known mother or sisters, he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led. He was tired of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr. Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie was always playing truant and running over to the Marches'.

“Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward, ” said the old gentleman. “The good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. I suspect she is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been his grandmother. Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. He can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can.”

What good times they had, to be sure! Such plays and tableaux, such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the great house. Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously, and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie played “lord of the manor” in the most delightful style.

But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not pluck up courage to go to the “Mansion of Bliss”, as Meg called it. She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows, and said “Hey! ” so loud, that he frightened her so much her “feet chattered on the floor, ” she never told her mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there any more, not even for the dear piano. No persuasions or enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to Mr. Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending matters. During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully led the conversation to music, and talked away about great singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if fascinated. At the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. Taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on about Laurie's lessons and teachers. And presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March—

“The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for he was getting too fond of it. But the piano suffers for want of use. Wouldn't some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma'am? ”

Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away. Before Mrs. March could reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile—

“They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time. For I'm shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine o'clock.”

Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak, for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired. “Please, tell the young ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why, never mind.” Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way—

“Oh sir, they do care, very very much! ”

“Are you the musical girl? ” he asked, without any startling “Hey! ” as he looked down at her very kindly.

“I'm Beth. I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed, ” she added, fearing to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.

“Not a soul, my dear. The house is empty half the day; so come and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to you.”

“How kind you are, sir! ”

Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore; but she was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her. The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard—

“I had a little girl once, with eyes like these. God bless you, my dear! Good day, madam.” And away he went, in a great hurry.

Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls were not home. How blithely she sang that evening, and how they all laughed at her because she woke Amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep. Next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. Quite by accident, of course, some pretty, easy music lay on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved friend.

She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude.

After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. She never knew that Mr. Laurence opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked. She never saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away. She never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much. So she enjoyed herself heartily, and found, what isn't always the case, that her granted wish was all she had hoped. Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her. At any rate she deserved both.

“Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way. Can I do it? ” asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.

“Yes, dear. It will please him very much, and be a nice way of thanking him. The girls will help you about them, and I will pay for the making up, ”replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself.

After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun. A cluster of grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty, and Beth worked away early and late, with occasional lifts over hard parts. She was a nimble little needlewoman, and they were finished before anyone got tired of them. Then she wrote a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.

When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would happen. All day passed and a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crotchety friend. On the afternoon of the second day, she went out to do an errand and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily exercise. As she came up the street, on her return, she saw three, yes, four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the moment they saw her, several hands were waved, and several joyful voices screamed—

“Here's a letter from the old gentleman! Come quick, and read it! ”

“Oh, Beth, he's sent you—” began Amy, gesticulating with unseemly energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by slamming down the window.

Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense. At the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession, all pointing and all saying at once, “Look there! Look there! ” Beth did look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed like a sign board to “Miss Elizabeth March.”

“For me? ” gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.

“Yes, all for you, my precious! Isn't it splendid of him? Don't you think he's the dearest old man in the world? Here's the key in the letter. We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he says, ” cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.

“You read it! I can't, I feel so queer! Oh, it is too lovely! ” and Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.

Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw were—





Miss March,

Dear Madam—





“How nice it sounds! I wish someone would write to me so! ” said Amy, who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.





I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had any that suited me so well as yours.

Heartsease is my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle giver. I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow “the old gentleman” to send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he lost. With hearty thanks and best wishes, I remain Your grateful friend and humble servant.

JAMES LAURENCE





“There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie told me how fond Mr. Laurence used to be of the child who died, and how he kept all her little things carefully. Just think, he's given you her piano. That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music, ” said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before.

“See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and stool, all complete, ” added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying its beauties.

“‘Your humble servant, James Laurence.' Only think of his writing that to you. I'll tell the girls. They'll think it's splendid, ” said Amy, much impressed by the note.

“Try it, honey. Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny, ” said Hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.

So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard. It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals.

“You'll have to go and thank him, ” said Jo, by way of a joke, for the idea of the child's really going never entered her head.

“Yes, I mean to. I guess I'll go now, before I get frightened thinking about it.” And, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the Laurences' door.

“Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever see! The pianny has turned her head! She'd never have gone in her right mind, ” cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle.

They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did afterward. If you will believe me, she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think, and when a gruff voice called out,“Come in! ” she did go in, right up to Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand, saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, “I came to thank you, sir, for—” But she didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed him.

If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old gentleman wouldn't have been more astonished. But he liked it—oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly! And was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again. Beth ceased to fear him from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and gratitude can conquer pride. When she went home, he walked with her to her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat as he marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.

When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig, by way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, “Well, I do believe the world is coming to an end! ”





CHAPTER 7

AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION


“THAT BOY is a perfect Cyclops, isn't he? ” said Amy one day, as Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip as he passed.

“How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes? And very handsome ones they are, too, ” cried Jo, who resented any slighting remarks about her friend.

“I didn't say anything about his eyes, and I don't see why you need fire up when I admire his riding.”

“Oh, my goodness! That little goose means a centaur, and she called him a Cyclops, ” exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.

“You needn't be so rude, it's only a ‘lapse of lingy', as Mr. Davis says, ” retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin. “I just wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse, ” she added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.

“Why? ” asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh at Amy's second blunder.

“I need it so much. I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be my turn to have the rag money for a month.”

“In debt, Amy? What do you mean? ” And Meg looked sober.

“Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop.”

“Tell me all about it. Are limes the fashion now? It used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls.” And Meg tried to keep her countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.

“Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to be thought mean, you must do it too. It's nothing but limes now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime, and trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper dolls, or something else, at recess. If one girl likes another, she gives her a lime. If she's mad with her, she eats one before her face, and doesn't offer even a suck. They treat by turns, and I've had ever so many but haven't returned them, and I ought for they are debts of honor, you know.”

“How much will pay them off and restore your credit? ” asked Meg, taking out her purse.

“A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over for a treat for you. Don't you like limes? ”

“Not much. You may have my share. Here's the money. Make it last as long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know.”

“Oh, thank you! It must be so nice to have pocket money! I'll have a grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week. I felt delicate about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm actually suffering for one.”

Next day Amy was rather late at school; but could not resist the temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk. During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to treat circulated through her “set”, and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming. Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the spot. Mary Kinglsey insisted on lending her her watch till recess; and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted Amy upon her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums. But Amy had not forgotten Miss Snow's cutting remarks about “some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people who were not too proud to ask for them” and she instantly crushed “that Snow girl's” hopes by the withering telegram,“You needn't be so polite all of a sudden, for you won't get any.”

A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning, and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss March to assume the airs of a studious young peacock. But, alas, alas! Pride goes before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success. No sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under pretense of asking an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk.

Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law. This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post office, had forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and caricatures, and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order. Boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than Dr. Blimber. Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek, Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher, and manners, morals, feelings, and examples were not considered of any particular importance. It was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it. Mr. Davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved. Therefore, to use the expressive, if not elegant, language of a schoolgirl, “He was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear.” The word“limes” was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity.

“Young ladies, attention, if you please! ”

At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.

“Miss March, come to the desk.”

Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.

“Bring with you the limes you have in your desk” was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.

“Don't take all, ” whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great presence of mind.

Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose. Unfortunately, Mr. Davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust added to his wrath.

“Is that all? ”

“Not quite, ” stammered Amy.

“Bring the rest immediately.”

With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.

“You are sure there are no more? ”

“I never lie, sir.”

“So I see. Now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them out of the window.”

There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust, as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing lips. Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful times, and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell from her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes. This—this was too much; all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime-lover burst into tears.

As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous“Hem! ” and said, in his most impressive manner—

“Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago. I am sorry this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed, and I never break my word.Miss March,hold out your hand.”

Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter. She was rather a favorite with “old Davis”, as, of course, he was called,and it's my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss. That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate.

“Your hand, Miss March! ” was the only answer her mute appeal received, and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw back her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm. They were neither many nor heavy, but that made no difference to her. For the first time in her life she had been struck, and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had knocked her down.

“You will now stand on the platform till recess, ” said Mr. Davis, resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.

That was dreadful. It would have been bad enough to go to her seat, and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied ones of her few enemies; but to face the whole school, with that shame fresh upon her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break her heart with crying. A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.

During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. To others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was a hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her before. The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought, “I shall have to tell at home, and they will be so disappointed in me! ”

The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at last, and the word “Recess! ” had never seemed so welcome to her before.

“You can go, Miss March, ” said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt, uncomfortable.

He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched her things, and left the place “forever, ” as she passionately declared to herself. She was in a sad state when she got home, and when the older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting was held at once. Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed, and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner. Meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this, Jo wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay, and Hannah shook her fist at the “villain” and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle.

No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates; but the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous. Just before school closed, Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk, and delivered a letter from her mother, then collected Amy's property, and departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet.

“Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to study a little every day with Beth, ” said Mrs. March that evening. “I don't approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. I dislike Mr. Davis's manner of teaching and don't think the girls you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall ask your father's advice before I send you anywhere else.”

“That's good! I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil his old school. It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes, ” sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.

“I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved some punishment for disobedience, ” was the severe reply, which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy.

“Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole school? ”cried Amy.

“I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault, ” replied her mother, “but I'm not sure that it won't do you more good than a bolder method. You are getting to be rather conceited, my dear, and it is quite time you set about correcting it. You have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long, even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.”

“So it is! ” cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner with Jo.“I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent for music, and she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn't have believed it if anyone had told her.”

“I wish I'd known that nice girl. Maybe she would have helped me, I'm so stupid, ” said Beth, who stood beside him, listening eagerly.

“You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could, ”answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery.

Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth, who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment. So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character. When he was gone, Amy, who had been pensive all evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea, “Is Laurie an accomplished boy? ”

“Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent; he will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting, ” replied her mother.

“And he isn't conceited, is he? ” asked Amy.

“Not in the least. That is why he is so charming and we all like him so much.”

“I see. It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to show off or get perked up, ” said Amy thoughtfully.

“These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner and conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display them, ”said Mrs. March.

“Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them, ” added Jo, and the lecture ended in a laugh.





CHAPTER 8

JO MEETS APOLLYON


“GIRLS, WHERE are you going? ” asked Amy, coming into their room one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.

“Never mind. Little girls shouldn't ask questions, ” returned Jo sharply.

Now if there is anything mortifying to our feelings when we are young, it is to be told that; and to be bidden to “run away, dear” is still more trying to us. Amy bridled up at this insult, and determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour. Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she said coaxingly, “Do tell me! I should think you might let me go, too, for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven't got anything to do, and am so lonely.”

“I can't, dear, because you aren't invited, ” began Meg, but Jo broke in impatiently, “Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it all. You can't go, Amy, so don't be a baby, and whine about it.”

“You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are. You were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and you stopped when I came in. Aren't you going with him? ”

“Yes, we are. Now do be still, and stop bothering.”

Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a fan into her pocket.

“I know!I know!You're going to the theater to see The Seven Castles of the Diamond Lake! ”she cried, adding resolutely,“and I shall go, for Mother said I might see it, and I've got my rag money, and it was mean not to tell me in time.”

“Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child, ” said Meg soothingly.“Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece. Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and have a nice time.”

“I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie. Please let me. I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, I'm dying for some fun. Do, Meg! I'll be ever so good, ” pleaded Amy, looking as pathetic as she could.

“Suppose we take her. I don't believe Mother would mind, if we bundle her up well, ” began Meg.

“If she goes I shan't,and if I don't,Laurie won't like it,and it will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in Amy. I should think she'd hate to poke herself where she isn't wanted, ” said Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself.

Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots on, saying,in her most aggravating way,“I shall go.Meg says I may,and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it.”

“You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you mustn't sit alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that will spoil our pleasure. Or he'll get another seat for you, and that isn't proper when you weren't asked. You shan't stir a step, so you may just stay where you are, ” scolded Jo, crosser than ever, having just pricked her finger in her hurry.

Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry and Meg to reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and the two girls hurried down, leaving their sister wailing. For now and then she forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a spoiled child. Just as the party was setting out, Amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone, “You'll be sorry for this, Jo March, see if you ain't.”

“Fiddlesticks! ” returned Jo, slamming the door.

They had a charming time, for The Seven Castles of the Diamond Lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish.But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it. The fairy queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her “sorry for it.” She and Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives, for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused. Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward. Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble. Her anger never lasted long, and having humbly confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do better. Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward. Poor Jo tried desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to subdue it.

When they got home, they found Amy reading in the parlor. She assumed an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes from her book, or asked a single question. Perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment, if Beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play. On going up to put away her best hat, Jo's first look was toward the bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had soothed her feelings by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the floor. Everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance into her various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.

There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest. Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together, late in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited and demanding breathlessly, “Has anyone taken my book? ”

Meg and Beth said, “No, ” at once, and looked surprised. Amy poked the fire and said nothing. Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute.

“Amy, you've got it! ”

“No, I haven't.”

“You know where it is, then! ”

“No, I don't.”

“That's a fib! ” cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.

“It isn't. I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and don't care.”

“You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once, or I'll make you.” And Jo gave her a slight shake.

“Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old book again, ” cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.

“Why not? ”

“I burned it up.”

“What! My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and meant to finish before Father got home? Have you really burned it? ” said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched Amy nervously.

“Yes, I did! I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross yesterday, and I have, so—”

Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a passion of grief and anger—

“You wicked, wicked girl! I never can write it again, and I'll never forgive you as long as I live.”

Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was quite beside herself; and, with a parting box on her sister's ear, she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone.

The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and, having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister. Jo's book was the pride of her heart, and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise. It was only half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo had worked over them patiently, putting her whole heart into her work, hoping to make something good enough to print. She had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the old manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years. It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo it was a dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be made up to her. Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg refused to defend her pet. Mrs. March looked grave and grieved, and Amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them.

When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly—

“Please forgive me, Jo. I'm very, very sorry.”

“I never shall forgive you” was Jo's stern answer, and from that moment she ignored Amy entirely.

No one spoke of the great trouble—not even Mrs. March, for all had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words were wasted,and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident, or her own generous nature, softened Jo's resentment and healed the breach. It was not a happy evening, for though they sewed as usual, while their mother read aloud from Bremer, Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and the sweet home peace was disturbed. They felt this most when singing time came, for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone, and Amy broke down, so Meg and Mother sang alone. But in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.

As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently, “My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger. Forgive each other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow.”

Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and cry her grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly weakness, and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn't quite forgive yet.So she winked hard, shook her head, and said gruffly because Amy was listening, “It was an abominable thing, and she doesn't deserve to be forgiven.”

With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night.

Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed, and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel more injured than ever, and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating. Jo still looked like a thunder cloud, and nothing went well all day. It was bitter cold in the morning, she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack of the fidgets,Meg was sensitive,Beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home, and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldn't even try when other people set them a virtuous example.

“Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating. He is always kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know, ” said Jo to herself, and off she went.

Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient exclamation.

“There! She promised I should go next time, for this is the last ice we shall have. But it's no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me.”

“Don't say that.You were very naughty,and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book, but I think she might do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the right minute, ” said Meg. “Go after them. Don't say anything till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, then take a quiet minute and just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I'm sure she'll be friends again with all her heart.”

“I'll try, ” said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a flurry to get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just disappearing over the hill.

It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy reached them. Jo saw her coming, and turned her back. Laurie did not see, for he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the ice, for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap.

“I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before we begin to race, ” Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.

Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a bitter, unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister's troubles. She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once. As Laurie turned the bend, he shouted back—

“Keep near the shore. It isn't safe in the middle.” Jo heard, but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word. Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear—

“No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of herself.”

Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn, and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the river. For a minute Jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart, then she resolved to go on, but something held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw up her hands and go down, with a sudden crash of rotten ice, the splash of water, and a cry that made Jo's heart stand still with fear. She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone. She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water. Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out—

“Bring a rail. Quick, quick! ”

How she did it, she never knew; but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite self-possessed, and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey stick till Jo dragged a rail from the fence, and together they got the child out, more frightened than hurt.

“Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can; pile our things on her, while I get off these confounded skates, ” cried Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before.

Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after an exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before a hot fire. During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet, and Mrs. March sitting by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.

“Are you sure she is safe? ” whispered Jo, looking remorsefully at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice.

“Quite safe, dear. She is not hurt, and won't even take cold, I think, you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly, ” replied her mother cheerfully.

“Laurie did it all. I only let her go. Mother, if she should die, it would be my fault.” And Jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her.

“It's my dreadful temper! I try to cure it; I think I have, and then it breaks out worse than ever. Oh, Mother, what shall I do? What shall I do? ”cried poor Jo, in despair.

“Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault, ” said Mrs. March, drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that Jo cried even harder.

“You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is! It seems as if I could do anything when I'm in a passion. I get so savage, I could hurt anyone and enjoy it.I'm afraid I shall do something dreadful some day,and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. Oh, Mother, help me, do help me! ”

“I will, my child, I will. Don't cry so bitterly, but remember this day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it. Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far greater than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them. You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like it.”

“Yours, Mother? Why, you are never angry! ” And for the moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise.

“I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in controlling it. I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it, and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years to do so.”

The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest reproof. She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her. The knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers, and tried to mend it, made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it, though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen.

“Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people worry you? ” asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before.

“Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips, and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will, I just go away for a minute, and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked, ”answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.

“How did you learn to keep still? That is what troubles me—for the sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the more I say the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's feelings and say dreadful things. Tell me how you do it, Marmee dear.”

“My good mother used to help me—”

“As you do us—” interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.

“But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and for years had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else. I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything.”

“Poor Mother! What helped you then? ”

“Your father, Jo. He never loses patience—never doubts or complains—but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him. He helped and comforted me, and showed me that I must try to practice all the virtues I would have my little girls possess, for I was their example. It was easier to try for your sakes than for my own. A startled or surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done; and the love, respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them copy.”

“Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be satisfied, ”cried Jo, much touched.

“I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch over your ‘bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not spoil your life. You have had a warning. Remember it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today.”

“I will try, Mother, I truly will. But you must help me, remind me, and keep me from flying out. I used to see Father sometimes put his finger on his lips, and look at you with a very kind but sober face, and you always folded your lips tight and went away. Was he reminding you then? ” asked Jo softly.

“Yes. I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it, but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look.”

Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she whispered anxiously, “Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it? I didn't mean to be rude, but it's so comfortable to say all I think to you, and feel so safe and happy here.”

“My Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much I love them.”

“I thought I'd grieved you.”

“No, dear; but speaking of Father reminded me how much I miss him, how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him.”

“Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he went, and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help, ” said Jo, wondering.

“I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears till he was gone. Why should I complain, when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end? If I don't seem to need help, it is because I have a better friend, even than Father, to comfort and sustain me. My child, the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly Father as you do that of your earthly one. The more you love and trust Him, the nearer you will feel to Him, and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom. His love and care never tire or change, can never be taken from you, but may become the source of lifelong peace, happiness, and strength. Believe this heartily, and go to God with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother.”

Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words. For in that sad yet happy hour, she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair, but the sweetness of self-denial and self-control, and led by her mother's hand, she had drawn nearer to the Friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father, tenderer than that of any mother.

Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault, Jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before.

“I let the sun go down on my anger. I wouldn't forgive her, and today, if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too late! How could I be so wicked? ” said Jo, half aloud, as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow.

As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms, with a smile that went straight to Jo's heart. Neither said a word, but they hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets, and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.





CHAPTER 9

MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR


“I DO THINK it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now, ” said Meg, one April day, as she stood packing the “go abroady” trunk in her room, surrounded by her sisters.

“And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid, ” replied Jo, looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.

“And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that, ” added Beth, tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for the great occasion.

“I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things, ”said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she artistically replenished her sister's cushion.

“I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least I can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get ready, ”said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.

“What did Mother give you out of the treasure box? ” asked Amy, who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when the proper time came.

“A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue sash. I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlatan.”

“It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it off beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you might have had it, ” said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use.

“There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want, ” replied Meg. “Now, let me see, there's my new gray walking suit—just curl up the feather in my hat,Beth—then my poplin for Sunday and the small party—it looks heavy for spring, doesn't it? The violet silk would be so nice. Oh, dear! ”

“Never mind, you've got the tarlatan for the big party, and you always look like an angel in white, ” said Amy, brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted.

“It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to do. My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that I feel as if I'd got a new one. My silk sacque isn't a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's. I didn't like to say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle. It's strong and neat, so I ought not to complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one with a gold top, ” sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor.

“Change it, ” advised Jo.

“I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much pains to get my things. It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common.” And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.

“Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put some on mine? ” she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins, fresh from Hannah's hands.

“No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain gowns without any trimming on them. Poor folks shouldn't rig, ” said Jo decidedly.

“I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps? ” said Meg impatiently.

“You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if you could only go to Annie Moffat's, ” observed Beth in her quiet way.

“So I did! Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for Mother to pack, ” said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many-times-pressed-and-mended white tarlatan, which she called her“ball dress” with an important air.

The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented than she went. But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life.

The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted, at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases, crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well as she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the more she envied her and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings.

She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls were busily employed in “having a good time.” They shopped, walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought. Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done. Everyone petted her, and “Daisy”, as they called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.

When the evening for the “small party” came, she found that the poplin wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed. So out came the tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud. No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms. But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.

“It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some, but these are altogether ravishing, ” cried Annie, with a great sniff.

“They are for Miss March, the man said. And here's a note, ” put in the maid, holding it to Meg.

“What fun! Who are they from? Didn't know you had a lover, ” cried the girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.

“The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie, ” said Meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.

“Oh, indeed! ” said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty.

Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was “the sweetest little thing she ever saw, ” and they looked quite charmed with her small attention. Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so very shabby now.

She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her heart's content. Everyone was very kind, and she had three compliments. Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice. Major Lincoln asked who “the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes” was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her because she “didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her, ” as he gracefully expressed it. So altogether she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall—

“How old is he? ”

“Sixteen or seventeen, I should say, ” replied another voice.

“It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't it? Sallie says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite dotes on them.”

“Mrs. M. has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her cards well, early as it is. The girl evidently doesn't think of it yet, ” said Mrs. Moffat.

“She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily. Poor thing! She'd be so nice if she was only got up in style. Do you think she'd be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday? ” asked another voice.

“She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has got. She may tear it tonight, and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one.”

Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated. She was proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had just heard. For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, “Mrs. M. has made her plans, ” “that fib about her mamma, ” and “dowdy tarlatan, ” till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard. Her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.

Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy, half resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right. Everybody dawdled that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work. Something in the manner of her friends struck Meg at once. They treated her with more respect, she thought, took quite a tender interest in what she said, and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity. All this surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and said, with a sentimental air—

“Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr. Laurence, for Thursday. We should like to know him, and it's only a proper compliment to you.”

Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely, “You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't come.”

“Why not,chérie? ”asked Miss Belle.

“He's too old.”

“My child, what do you mean? What is his age, I beg to know! ” cried Miss Clara.

“Nearly seventy, I believe, ” answered Meg, counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes.

“You sly creature! Of course we meant the young man, ” exclaimed Miss Belle, laughing.

“There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy.” And Meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover.

“About your age, ” Nan said.

“Nearer my sister Jo's; I am seventeen in August, ” returned Meg, tossing her head.

“It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it? ” said Annie, looking wise about nothing.

“Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are so fond of them. My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends, you know, so it is quite natural that we children should play together, ” and Meg hoped they would say no more.

“It's evident Daisy isn't out yet, ” said Miss Clara to Belle with a nod.

“Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round, ” returned Miss Belle with a shrug.

“I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls. Can I do anything for you, young ladies? ” asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace.

“No, thank you, ma'am, ” replied Sallie. “I've got my new pink silk for Thursday and don't want a thing.”

“Nor I—” began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them.

“What shall you wear? ” asked Sallie.

“My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen; it got sadly torn last night, ” said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling very uncomfortable.

“Why don't you send home for another? ” said Sallie, who was not an observing young lady.

“I haven't got any other.” It cost Meg an effort to say that, but Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, “Only that? How funny—”She did not finish her speech, for Belle shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly—

“Not at all; where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn't out yet? There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won't you, dear? ”

“You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you don't, it does well enough for a little girl like me, ” said Meg.

“Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style. I admire to do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there. I shan't let anyone see you till you are done, and then we'll burst upon them like Cinderella and her godmother going to the ball, ” said Belle in her persuasive tone.

Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she would be “a little beauty” after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the Moffats.

On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid, and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense would have added“a soupçon of rouge”, if Meg had not rebelled.They laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.

“Mademoiselle is charmante,très jolie, is she not? ”cried Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture.

“Come and show yourself, ” said Miss Belle, leading the way to the room where the others were waiting.

As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing, her earrings tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating, she felt as if her fun had really begun at last, for the mirror had plainly told her that she was “a little beauty”. Her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically, and for several minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in the fable, enjoying her borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like a party of magpies.

“While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up. Take your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head, Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work of my hands, ” said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased with her success.

“You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice. I'm nowhere beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're quite French, I assure you. Let your flowers hang, don't be so careful of them, and be sure you don't trip, ” returned Sallie, trying not to care that Meg was prettier than herself.

Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely down stairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and a few early guests were assembled. She very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect. Several young ladies, who had taken no notice of her before, were very affectionate all of a sudden. Several young gentlemen, who had only stared at her at the other party, now not only stared, but asked to be introduced, and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her, and several old ladies, who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest of the party, inquired who she was with an air of interest. She heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them.

“Daisy March—father a colonel in the army—one of our first families, but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild about her.”

“Dear me! ” said the old lady, putting up her glass for another observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs.

The “queer feeling” did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken. She was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused, for just opposite, she saw Laurie. He was staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on. To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked unusually boyish and shy.

“Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head. I won't care for it, or let it change me a bit, ” thought Meg, and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend.

“I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't.” she said, with her most grown-up air.

“Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I did, ”answered Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her maternal tone.

“What shall you tell her? ” asked Meg, full of curiosity to know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time.

“I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike yourself, I'm quite afraid of you, ” he said, fumbling at his glove button.

“How absurd of you! The girls dressed me up for fun, and I rather like it. Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me? ” said Meg, bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not.

“Yes, I think she would, ” returned Laurie gravely.

“Don't you like me so? ” asked Meg.

“No, I don't, ” was the blunt reply.

“Why not? ” in an anxious tone.

He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer, which had not a particle of his usual politeness in it.

“I don't like fuss and feathers.”

That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and Meg walked away, saying petulantly, “You are the rudest boy I ever saw.”

Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color. As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by, and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother—

“They are making a fool of that little girl; I wanted you to see her, but they have spoiled her entirely; she's nothing but a doll tonight.”

“Oh, dear! ” sighed Meg. “I wish I'd been sensible and worn my own things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself.”

She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half hidden by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz had begun, till some one touched her, and turning, she saw Laurie, looking penitent, as he said, with his very best bow and his hand out—

“Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me.”

“I'm afraid it will be too disagreeable to you, ” said Meg, trying to look offended and failing entirely.

“Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it. Come, I'll be good. I don't like your gown, but I do think you are—just splendid.” And he waved his hands, as if words failed to express his admiration.

Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time, “Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up; it's the plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it.”

“Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful, ” said Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of.

Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home, they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff.

“Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you? ” said Meg, as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she would not own why.

“Won't I! ” said Laurie, with alacrity.

“Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight. They won't understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.”

“Then why did you do it? ” said Laurie's eyes, so plainly that Meg hastily added—

“I shall tell them myself all about it, and ‘fess' to Mother how silly I've been. But I'd rather do it myself. So you'll not tell, will you? ”

“I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when they ask me? ”

“Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time.”

“I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the other? You don't look as if you were having a good time. Are you? ” And Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper—

“No, not just now. Don't think I'm horrid. I only wanted a little fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting tired of it.”

“Here comes Ned Moffat; what does he want? ” said Laurie, knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.

“He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's coming for them. What a bore! ” said Meg, assuming a languid air which amused Laurie immensely.

He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw her drinking champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving“like a pair of fools, ” as Laurie said to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed.

“You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink much of that. I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you know, ” he whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to refill her glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan.

“I'm not Meg tonight, I'm ‘a doll' who does all sorts of crazy things. Tomorrow I shall put away my ‘fuss and feathers' and be desperately good again, ” she answered with an affected little laugh.

“Wish tomorrow was here, then, ” muttered Laurie, walking off, ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.

Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other girls did; after supper she undertook the German, and blundered through it, nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and romping in a way that scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated a lecture. But he got no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away from him till he came to say good night.

“Remember! ” she said, trying to smile, for the splitting headache had already begun.

“Silence à la mort, ”replied Laurie,with a melodramatic flourish,as he went away.

This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she expected. She was sick all the next day, and on Saturday went home, quite used up with her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had “sat in the lap of luxury” long enough.

“It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all the time. Home is a nice place, though it isn't splendid, ” said Meg, looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening.

“I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters, ” replied her mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day. For motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children's faces.

Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking worried. As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg suddenly left her chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows on her mother's knee, saying bravely—

“Marmee, I want to ‘fess'.”

“I thought so. What is it, dear? ”

“Shall I go away? ” asked Jo discreetly.

“Of course not. Don't I always tell you everything? I was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children, but I want you to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats'.”

“We are prepared, ” said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a little anxious.

“I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a fashion-plate. Laurie thought I wasn't proper. I know he did, though he didn't say so, and one man called me ‘a doll'. I knew it was silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me.”

“Is that all? ” asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies.

“No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and was altogether abominable, ” said Meg self-reproachfully.

“There is something more, I think.” And Mrs. March smoothed the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly—

“Yes. It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate to have people say and think such things about us and Laurie.”

Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the Moffats', and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly, as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent mind.

“Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard, ” cried Jo indignantly. “Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the spot? ”

“I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me. I couldn't help hearing at first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't remember that I ought to go away.”

“Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff. The idea of having ‘plans' and being kind to Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by! Won't he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor children? ” And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke.

“If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you! She mustn't, must she, Mother? ” said Meg, looking distressed.

“No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon as you can, ”said Mrs. March gravely. “I was very unwise to let you go among people of whom I know so little—kind, I dare say, but worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young people. I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this visit may have done you, Meg.”

“Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me. I'll forget all the bad and remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very much for letting me go. I'll not be sentimental or dissatisfied, Mother. I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll stay with you till I'm fit to take care of myself. But it is nice to be praised and admired, and I can't help saying I like it, ” said Meg, looking half ashamed of the confession.

“That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things. Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, Meg.”

Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands behind her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and things of that sort; and Jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow.

“Mother, do you have ‘plans', as Mrs. Moffat said? ” asked Meg bashfully.

“Yes, my dear, I have a great many; all mothers do, but mine differ somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect. I will tell you some of them, for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right, on a very serious subject. You are young, Meg, but not too young to understand me, and mothers' lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you. Jo, your turn will come in time, perhaps, so listen to my ‘plans' and help me carry them out, if they are good.”

Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair. Holding a hand of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully, Mrs. March said, in her serious yet cheery way—

“I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good; to be admired, loved, and respected; to have a happy youth, to be well and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives, with as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send. To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience. It is natural to think of it, Meg, right to hope and wait for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that when the happy time comes, you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy.My dear girls,I am ambitious for you,but not to have you make a dash in the world—marry rich men merely because they are rich, or have splendid houses, which are not homes because love is wanting. Money is a needful and precious thing—and when well used, a noble thing—but I never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for. I'd rather see you poor men's wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on thrones, without self-respect and peace.”

“Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they put themselves forward, ” sighed Meg.

“Then we'll be old maids, ” said Jo stoutly.

“Right, Jo; better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands, ” said Mrs. March decidedly. “Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these things to time. Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are not. One thing remember, my girls. Mother is always ready to be your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort of our lives.”

“We will, Marmee, we will! ” cried both, with all their hearts, as she bade them good night.





CHAPTER 10

THE P. C. AND P. O.


AS SPRING CAME on, a new set of amusements became the fashion, and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts. The garden had to be put in order, and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with. Hannah used to say, “I'd know which each of them gardings belonged to, if I see 'em in Chiny, ” and so she might, for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters. Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it. Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying experiments. This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers, the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed Aunt Cockle-top and her family of chicks. Beth had old-fashioned fragrant flowers in her garden—sweet peas and mignonette, larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies. Amy had a bower in hers—rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at—with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there.

Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions—some old, some new—all more or less original. One of these was the “P.C.”, for as secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one, and as all of the girls admired Dickens, they called themselves the Pickwick Club. With a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a year, and met every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows: Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with a big “P.C.” in different colors on each,and the weekly newspaper called,The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed something, while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor. At seven o'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick; Jo, being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass; Beth, because she was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman; and Amy, who was always trying to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle. Pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and shortcomings. On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to read:

“THE PICKWICK PORTFOLIO”

MAY 20, 18—

POET'S CORNER



* * *



ANNIVERSARY ODE





Again we meet to celebrate

With badge and solemn rite,

Our fifty-second anniversary,

In Pickwick Hall, tonight.





We all are here in perfect health,

None gone from our small band:

Again we see each well-known face,

And press each friendly hand.





Our Pickwick, always at his post,

With reverence we greet,

As, spectacles on nose, he reads

Our well-filled weekly sheet.





Although he suffers from a cold,

We joy to hear him speak,

For words of wisdom from him fall,

In spite of croak or squeak.





Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,

With elephantine grace,

And beams upon the company,

With brown and jovial face.





Poetic fire lights up his eye,

He struggles 'gainst his lot.

Behold ambition on his brow,

And on his nose a blot!





Next our peaceful Tupman comes,

So rosy, plump, and sweet,

Who chokes with laughter at the puns,

And tumbles off his seat.





Prim little Winkle too is here,

With every hair in place,

A model of propriety,

Though he hates to wash his face.





The year is gone, we still unite

To joke and laugh and read,

And tread the path of literature

That doth to glory lead.





Long may our paper prosper well,

Our club unbroken be,

And coming years their blessings pour

On the useful, gay “P. C.”.

A. SNODGRASS





THE MASKED MARRIAGE

(A Tale of Venice)

Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps, and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count Adelon. Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance. Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on.

“Has your Highness seen the Lady Viola tonight? ” asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm.

“Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad! Her dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates.”

“By my faith, I envy him. Yonder he comes, arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask. When that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her stern father bestows her hand, ” returned the troubadour.

“'Tis whispered that she loves the young English artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the old count, ”said the lady, as they joined the dance.

The revel was at its height when a priest appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove, hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel. Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:

“My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. Father, we wait your services.”

All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom removed their masks. Curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over. Then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding an explanation.

“Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I yielded to it. Now, my children, let the play end. Unmask and receive my blessing.”

But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an English earl was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.

“My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the Count Antonio. I can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady, now my wife.”

The count stood like one changed to stone, and turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with a gay smile of triumph, “To you, my gallant friends, I can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have by this masked marriage.”

THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH





Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden, and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many squashes. One day in October, when they were ripe, he picked one and took it to market. A grocerman bought and put it in his shop. That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went and bought it for her mother. She lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it with salt and butter, for dinner. And to the rest she added a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg, and some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it till it was brown and nice, and next day it was eaten by a family named March.

A SAD ACCIDENT





On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock in our basement, followed by cries of distress. On rushing in a body to the cellar, we discovered our beloved President prostrate upon the floor, having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes. A perfect scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water, upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form, and torn his garments badly. On being removed from this perilous situation, it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add, is now doing well.

THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT





It is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs. Snowball Pat Paw. This lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends;for her beauty attracted all eyes, her graces and virtues endeared her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community.

When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching the butcher's cart, and it is feared that some villain, tempted by her charms, basely stole her. Weeks have passed, but no trace of her has been discovered, and we relinquish all hope, tie a black ribbon to her basket, set aside her dish, and weep for her as one lost to us forever.

A LAMENT

FOR S. B. PAT PAW





We mourn the loss of our little pet,

And sigh o'er her hapless fate,

For never more by the fire she'll sit,

Nor play by the old green gate.





The little grave where her infant sleeps

Is 'neath the chestnut tree.

But o'er her grave we may not weep,

We know not where it may be.





Her empty bed, her idle ball,

Will never see her more;

No gentle tap, no loving purr

Is heard at the parlor door.





Another cat comes after her mice,

A cat with a dirty face,

But she does not hunt as our darling did,

Nor play with her airy grace.





Her stealthy paws tread the very hall

Where Snowball used to play,

But she only spits at the dogs our pet

So gallantly drove away.





She is useful and mild, and does her best,

But she is not fair to see,

And we cannot give her your place dear,

Nor worship her as we worship thee.

A. S.

WEEKLY REPORT

Meg—Good.

Jo—Bad.

Beth—Very Good.

Amy—Middling.



* * *



As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls once upon a time), a round of applause followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass rose to make a proposition.

“Mr. President and gentlemen, ” he began, assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone, “I wish to propose the admission of a new member—one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice. I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an honorary member of the P. C. Come now, do have him.”

Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass took his seat.

“We'll put it to a vote, ” said the President. “All in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying, ‘Aye.'”

A loud response from Snodgrass, followed, to everybody's surprise, by a timid one from Beth.

“Contrary-minded say, ‘No.'”

Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to say with great elegance, “We don't wish any boys, they only joke and bounce about. This is a ladies' club, and we wish to be private and proper.”

“I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us afterward, ”observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her forehead, as she always did when doubtful.

Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest. “Sir, I give you my word as a gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort. He likes to write, and he'll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental, don't you see? We can do so little for him, and he does so much for us, I think the least we can do is to offer him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes.”

This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to his feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind.

“Yes,we ought to do it,even if we are afraid.I say he may come,and his grandpa, too, if he likes.”

This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly. “Now then, vote again. Everybody remember it's our Laurie, and say, ‘Aye! '” cried Snodgrass excitedly.

“Aye! Aye! Aye! ” replied three voices at once.

“Good! Bless you! Now, as there's nothing like ‘taking time by the fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me to present the new member.” And, to the dismay of the rest of the club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.

“You rogue! You traitor! Jo, how could you? ” cried the three girls, as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.

“The coolness of you two rascals is amazing, ” began Mr. Pickwick, trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile. But the new member was equal to the occasion, and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said in the most engaging manner, “Mr. President and ladies—I beg pardon, gentlemen—allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very humble servant of the club.”

“Good! Good! ” cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned.

“My faithful friend and noble patron, ” continued Laurie with a wave of the hand, “who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight. I planned it, and she only gave in after lots of teasing.”

“Come now, don't lay it all on yourself. You know I proposed the cupboard, ” broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke amazingly.

“Never you mind what she says. I'm the wretch that did it, sir, ” said the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick. “But on my honor,I never will do so again,and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club.”

“Hear! Hear! ” cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal.

“Go on, go on! ” added Winkle and Tupman, while the President bowed benignly.

“I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails—also the females, if I may be allowed the expression. It's the old martin house, but I've stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it will hold all sorts of things, and save our valuable time. Letters, manuscripts, books, and bundles can be passed in there, and as each nation has a key, it will be uncommonly nice, I fancy. Allow me to present the club key, and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat.”

Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time before order could be restored. A long discussion followed, and everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her best. So it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn till a late hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member.

No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller, for a more devoted, well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have. He certainly did add “spirit” to the meetings, and “a tone” to the paper, for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic, but never sentimental. Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton, or Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she thought.

The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office. Tragedies and cravats, poetry and pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread, rubbers, invitations, scoldings, and puppies. The old gentleman liked the fun, and amused himself by sending odd bundles, mysterious messages, and funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's care. How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come.





CHAPTER 11

EXPERIMENTS


“THE FIRST OF June! The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow, and I'm free. Three months' vacation—how I shall enjoy it! ” exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took off her dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment of the whole party.

“Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful! ” said Jo. “I was mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her; if she had, I should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me. I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for as it drove off, she popped out her head, saying,‘Josyphine, won't you—? ' I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled. I did actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe.”

“Poor old Jo! She came in looking as if bears were after her, ” said Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.

“Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not? ” observed Amy, tasting her mixture critically.

“She means vampire,not seaweed,but it doesn't matter.It's too warm to be particular about one's parts of speech, ” murmured Jo.

“What shall you do all your vacation? ” asked Amy, changing the subject with tact.

“I shall lie abed late, and do nothing, ” replied Meg, from the depths of the rocking chair. “I've been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people, so now I'm going to rest and revel to my heart's content.”

“No, ” said Jo, “that dozy way wouldn't suit me. I've laid in a heap of books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree, when I'm not having l—”

“Don't say ‘larks! '” implored Amy, as a return snub for the “samphire”correction.

“I'll say ‘nightingales, ' then, with Laurie. That's proper and appropriate, since he's a warbler.”

“Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play all the time and rest, as the girls mean to, ” proposed Amy.

“Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind. I want to learn some new songs, and my children need fitting up for the summer. They are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes.”

“May we, Mother? ” asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in what they called “Marmee's corner”.

“You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like it. I think by Saturday night you will find that all play and no work is as bad as all work and no play.”

“Oh, dear, no! It will be delicious, I'm sure, ” said Meg complacently.

“I now propose a toast, as my ‘friend and pardner, Sairy Gamp, ' says. Fun forever, and no grubbing! ” cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the lemonade went round.

They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day. Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock.Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's books lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but “Marmee's corner”, which looked as usual. And there Meg sat, to “rest and read, ”which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide,Wide World,up in the apple tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.

At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in the afternoon and got a “sweet blue muslin”, had discovered, after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her slightly cross. Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy Brown's party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she had “nothing to wear.” But these were mere trifles, and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said nothing, and with Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the “resting and reveling” process. The days kept getting longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury, Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily, that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work,and fell back into her old ways now and then. But something in the air affected her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed—so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she was “a fright”. Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were small, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden. She didn't like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn't draw all the time. Tea parties didn't amount to much, neither did picnics, unless very well conducted. “If one could have a fine house, full of nice girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz, ” complained Miss Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.

No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.

When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in the kitchen, no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother anywhere to be seen.

“Mercy on us! What has happened? ” cried Jo, staring about her in dismay.

Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved but rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.

“Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can. It's a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself. But she says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble but take care of ourselves.”

“That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for something to do—that is, some new amusement, you know, ” added Jo quickly.

In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work,and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's saying,“Housekeeping ain't no joke.” There was plenty of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.

“I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not to think of her, for she'd take care of herself, ” said Meg, who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot.

So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the cook's compliments. The boiled tea was very bitter, the omelet scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but Mrs. March received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after Jo was gone.

“Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid, but they won't suffer, and it will do them good, ” she said, producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt—a motherly little deception for which they were grateful.

Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures. “Never mind, I'll get the dinner and be servant, you be mistress, keep your hands nice, see company, and give orders, ” said Jo, who knew still less than Meg about culinary affairs.

This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired to the parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting. Jo, with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel, immediately put a note in the office, inviting Laurie to dinner.

“You'd better see what you have got before you think of having company, ” said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.

“Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of potatoes, and I shall get some asparagus and a lobster, ‘for a relish, ' as Hannah says. We'll have lettuce and make a salad. I don't know how, but the book tells. I'll have blancmange and strawberries for dessert, and coffee too, if you want to be elegant.”

“Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat. I wash my hands of the dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own responsibility, you may just take care of him.”

“I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding. You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle, won't you? ”asked Jo, rather hurt.

“Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few trifles. You had better ask Mother's leave before you order anything, ” returned Meg prudently.

“Of course I shall. I'm not a fool.” And Jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers.

“Get what you like, and don't disturb me. I'm going out to dinner and can't worry about things at home, ” said Mrs. March, when Jo spoke to her.“I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going to take a vacation today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself.”

The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.

“Everything is out of sorts, somehow, ” she said to herself, going downstairs. “There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that something is wrong in this family. If Amy is bothering, I'll shake her.”

Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if imploring the food for want of which he had died.

“It's all my fault—I forgot him—there isn't a seed or a drop left. Oh, Pip! Oh, Pip! How could I be so cruel to you? ” cried Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him.

Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and finding him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino box for a coffin.

“Put him in the oven, and maybe he will get warm and revive, ” said Amy hopefully.

“He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead. I'll make him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll never have another bird, never, my Pip! for I am too bad to own one, ” murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands.

“The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go. Now, don't cry, Beth. It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week, and Pip has had the worst of the experiment. Make the shroud, and lay him in my box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice little funeral, ” said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal.

Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen, which was in a most discouraging state of confusion. Putting on a big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing, when she discovered that the fire was out.

“Here's a sweet prospect! ” muttered Jo, slamming the stove door open, and poking vigorously among the cinders.

Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the water heated. The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid strawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure appeared, demanding tartly—

“I say, isn't bread ‘riz' enough when it runs over the pans? ”

Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. Mrs. March went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. A strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she'd come to dinner. Now this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw. They disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and had few friends. So Meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she asked questions, criticized everything, and told stories of the people whom she knew.

Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone, and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever. The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves. The potatoes had to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at the last. The blancmange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked, having been skilfully “deaconed.”

“Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are hungry, only it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing, ” thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide.

Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked distressed, Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. Jo's one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water hastily. Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.

“Oh, what is it? ” exclaimed Jo, trembling.

“Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour, ” replied Meg with a tragic gesture.

Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator. She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts. The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks. So did everyone else, even “Croaker”, as the girls called the old lady, and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives and fun.

“I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will sober ourselves with a funeral, ” said Jo, as they rose, and Miss Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at another friend's dinner table.

They did sober themselves for Beth's sake. Laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears by his tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph, composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.





Here lies Pip March,

Who died the 7th of June;

Loved and lamented sore,

And not forgotten soon.





At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room, overcome with emotion and lobster; but there was no place of repose, for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order. Meg helped Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper. Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper. Mrs. March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment.

Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and there was a scramble to get ready to see them. Then tea must be got, errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute. As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one they gathered on the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully, and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.

“What a dreadful day this has been! ” began Jo, usually the first to speak.

“It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable, ” said Meg.

“Not a bit like home, ” added Amy.

“It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip, ” sighed Beth, glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.

“Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow, if you want it.”

As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them,looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.

“Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want another week of it? ” she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn toward the sun.

“I don't! ” cried Jo decidedly.

“Nor I, ” echoed the others.

“You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others, do you? ”

“Lounging and larking doesn't pay, ” observed Jo, shaking her head.“I'm tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off.”

“Suppose you learn plain cooking. That's a useful accomplishment, which no woman should be without, ” said Mrs. March, laughing inaudibly at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she had met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it.

“Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how we'd get on? ” cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.

“Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you got on pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy or amiable. So I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all? ”

“We do, Mother, we do! ” cried the girls.

“Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again, for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for everyone. It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion.”

“We'll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don't, ” said Jo. “I'll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the next dinner party I have shall be a success.”

“I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting you do it, Marmee. I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing. That will be better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty nice enough as they are.” said Meg.

“I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music and dolls. I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying, not playing, ”was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their example by heroically declaring, “I shall learn to make buttonholes, and attend to my parts of speech.”

“Very good! Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the other extreme and delve like slaves. Have regular hours for work and play, make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success, in spite of poverty.”

“We'll remember, Mother! ” And they did.





CHAPTER 12

CAMP LAURENCE


BETH WAS postmistress, for, being most at home, she could attend to it regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of unlocking the little door and distributing the mail. One July day she came in with her hands full, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post.

“Here's your posy, Mother! Laurie never forgets that, ” she said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in “Marmee's corner”, and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.

“Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove, ” continued Beth, delivering the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands.

“Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one, ” said Meg, looking at the gray cotton glove. “Didn't you drop the other in the garden? ”

“No, I'm sure I didn't, for there was only one in the office.”

“I hate to have odd gloves! Never mind, the other may be found. My letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted. I think Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's writing.”

Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied.

“Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat, which covered the whole post office and stuck outside, ” said Beth, laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing.

“What a sly fellow Laurie is! I said I wished bigger hats were the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day. He said, ‘Why mind the fashion? Wear a big hat, and be comfortable! ' I said I would if I had one, and he has sent me this,to try me.I'll wear it for fun,and show him I don't care for the fashion.” And hanging the antique broad-brim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her letters.

One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill, for it said to her—





My Dear,

I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction I watch your efforts to control your temper. You say nothing about your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps, that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask, if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook. I, too, have seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. Go on, dear, patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one sympathizes more tenderly with you than your loving—

Mother





“That does me good! That's worth millions of money and pecks of praise. Oh, Marmee, I do try! I will keep on trying, and not get tired, since I have you to help me.”

Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears,for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly encouraging, because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued. Feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or bad news. In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote—





Dear Jo,

What ho!

Some English girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow and I want to have a jolly time. If it's fine, I'm going to pitch my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet—have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks. They are nice people, and like such things. Brooke will go to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for the girls. I want you all to come, can't let Beth off at any price, and nobody shall worry her. Don't bother about rations, I'll see to that and everything else, only do come, there's a good fellow!

In a tearing hurry,

Yours ever

Laurie





“Here's richness! ” cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.

“Of course we can go, Mother? It will be such a help to Laurie, for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children be useful in some way.”

“I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people. Do you know anything about them, Jo? ” asked Meg.

“Only that there are four of them. Kate is older than you, Fred and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who is nine or ten. Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. I fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn't admire Kate much.”

“I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing and so becoming! ” observed Meg complacently. “Have you anything decent, Jo? ”

“Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me. I shall row and tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of. You'll come, Betty? ”

“If you won't let any boys talk to me.”

“Not a boy! ”

“I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke, he is so kind. But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything. I'll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me, Jo, so I'll go.”

“That's my good girl. You do try to fight off your shyness, and I love you for it. Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know, and a cheery word kind of gives a lift. Thank you, Mother, ” And Jo gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss,more precious to Mrs. March than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.

“I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy, ”said Amy, showing her mail.

“And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over and play to him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall go, ” added Beth, whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered finely.

“Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play tomorrow with free minds, ” said Jo, preparing to replace her pen with a broom.

When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning to promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight. Each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper. Meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching separation, and Amy had capped the climax by putting a clothespin on her nose to uplift the offending feature. It was one of the kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards, therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now being put. This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.

Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party, and soon a lively bustle began in both houses. Beth, who was ready first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters' toilets by frequent telegrams from the window.

“There goes the man with the tent! I see Mrs. Barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket. Now Mr. Laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock. I wish he would go too. There's Laurie, looking like a sailor—nice boy! Oh, mercy me! Here's a carriage full of people—a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch. Laurie didn't tell us that. Be quick, girls! It's getting late. Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare. Meg, isn't that the man who bowed to you one day when we were shopping? ”

“So it is. How queer that he should come. I thought he was at the mountains. There is Sallie. I'm glad she got back in time. Am I all right, Jo? ” cried Meg in a flutter.

“A regular daisy. Hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff. Now, then, come on! ”

“Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat? It's too absurd! You shall not make a guy of yourself, ”remonstrated Meg,as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.

“I just will, though, for it's capital—so shady, light, and big. It will make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable.” With that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed—a bright little band of sisters, all looking their best in summer suits, with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims.

Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner. The lawn was the reception room, and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there. Meg was grateful to see that Miss Kate, though twenty, was dressed with a simplicity which American girls would do well to imitate, and who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances that he came especially to see her. Jo understood why Laurie “primmed up his mouth” when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a standoff-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the free and easy demeanor of the other girls. Beth took an observation of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not “dreadful”, but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that account. Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person, and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they suddenly became very good friends.

Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the shore. Laurie and Jo rowed one boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water bug. Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of general utility. It broke the ice in the beginning by producing a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and fro as she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the whole party, if a shower came up, she said. Miss Kate decided that she was “odd, but rather clever, ” and smiled upon her from afar.

Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon “skill and dexterity”. Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice. Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge. He never talked to her much, but he looked at her a good deal, and she felt sure that he did not regard her with aversion. Ned, being in college, of course put on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to assume. He was not very wise, but very good-natured, and altogether an excellent person to carry on a picnic. Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.

It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and the wickets down by the time they arrived. A pleasant green field, with three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet.

“Welcome to Camp Laurence! ” said the young host, as they landed with exclamations of delight.

“Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the other fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company. The tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. Now, let's have a game before it gets hot, and then we'll see about dinner.”

Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight. Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred. Laurie took Sallie, Jo, and Ned. The English played well, but the Americans played better, and contested every inch of the ground as strongly as if the spirit of '76 inspired them. Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words. Jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke, which failure ruffled her a good deal. Fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers. He gave a stroke, his ball hit the wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side. No one was very near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.

“I'm through! Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in first, ” cried the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another blow.

“You pushed it. I saw you; it's my turn now, ” said Jo sharply.

“Upon my word, I didn't move it; it rolled a bit, perhaps, but that is allowed; so stand off, please, and let me have a go at the stake.”

“We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose, ” said Jo angrily.

“Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows. There you go! ”returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.

Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself in time, colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering down a wicket with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and declared himself out with much exultation. She went off to get her ball, and was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently. It took several strokes to regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the last but one and lay near the stake.

“By George, it's all up with us! Good-by, Kate. Miss Jo owes me one, so you are finished, ” cried Fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see the finish.

“Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies, ” said Jo, with a look that made the lad redden, “especially when they beat them, ”she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she won the game by a clever stroke.

Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do to exult over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle of the cheer to whisper to his friend, “Good for you, Jo! He did cheat, I saw him. We can't tell him so, but he won't do it again, take my word for it.”

Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and said approvingly, “It was dreadfully provoking, but you kept your temper, and I'm so glad, Jo.”

“Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute. I should certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the nettles till I got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue. It's simmering now, so I hope he'll keep out of my way, ” returned Jo, biting her lips as she glowered at Fred from under her big hat.

“Time for lunch, ” said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch. “Commissary general, will you make the fire and get water, while Miss March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table? Who can make good coffee? ”

“Jo can, ” said Meg, glad to recommend her sister. So Jo, feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went to preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by. Miss Kate sketched and Frank talked to Beth, who was making little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates.

The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green leaves. Jo announced that the coffee was ready, and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome appetites. A very merry lunch it was, for everything seemed fresh and funny, and frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near by. There was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on. Three white-headed children peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main.

“There's salt here, ” said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer of berries.

“Thank you, I prefer spiders, ” she replied, fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death. “How dare you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when yours is so nice in every way? ” added Jo, as they both laughed and ate out of one plate, the china having run short.

“I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got over it yet. This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do anything. It's you and Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and I'm no end obliged to you. What shall we do when we can't eat anymore? ” asked Laurie, feeling that his trump card had been played when lunch was over.

“Have games till it's cooler. I brought Authors, and I dare say Miss Kate knows something new and nice. Go and ask her. She's company, and you ought to stay with her more.”

“Aren't you company too? I thought she'd suit Brooke, but he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that ridiculous glass of hers. I'm going, so you needn't try to preach propriety, for you can't do it, Jo.”

Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would not, and the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to the drawing room to play Rig-marole.

“One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells as long as he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some exciting point, when the next takes it up and does the same. It's very funny when well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over. Please start it, Mr. Brooke, ” said Kate, with a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman.

Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river.

“Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek his fortune, for he had nothing but his sword and his shield. He traveled a long while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and had a hard time of it, till he came to the palace of a good old king, who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was very fond. The knight agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely, for the colt was a gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master, though he was freakish and wild. Every day, when he gave his lessons to this pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city, and as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face, which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found. One day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window of a ruinous castle the lovely face. He was delighted, inquired who lived in this old castle, and was told that several captive princesses were kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay up money to buy their liberty. The knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine. At last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them. He went and knocked. The great door flew open, and he beheld—”

“A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of rapture, ‘At last! At last! '” continued Kate, who had read French novels, and admired the style. “‘'Tis she! ' cried Count Gustave, and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy. ‘Oh, rise! ' she said, extending a hand of marble fairness. ‘Never! Till you tell me how I may rescue you, ' swore the knight, still kneeling. ‘Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant is destroyed.'‘Where is the villain? ' ‘In the mauve salon. Go, brave heart, and save me from despair.' ‘I obey, and return victorious or dead! ' With these thrilling words he rushed away, and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter, when he received—”

“A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him, ” said Ned. “Instantly, Sir What's-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till he came to a little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March. At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight that took his breath away and chilled his blood—”

“A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand, ” went on Meg. “It beckoned, gliding noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil. They reached a curtained door, behind which sounded lovely music. He sprang forward to enter, but the specter plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a—”

“Snuffbox, ” said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the audience. “‘Thankee, ' said the knight politely, as he took a pinch and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off. ‘Ha! Ha! ' laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up her victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven other knights packed together without their heads, like sardines, who all rose and began to—”

“Dance a hornpipe, ” cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, “and, as they danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in full sail. ‘Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard alee, and man the guns! ' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. ‘Go in and win, my hearties! ' says the captain, and a tremendous fight began. Of course the British beat—they always do.”

“No, they don't! ” cried Jo, aside.

“Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over the schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose lee scuppers ran blood, for the order had been ‘Cutlasses, and die hard! ' ‘Bosun's mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet, and start this villain if he doesn't confess his sins double quick, ' said the British captain. The Portuguese held his tongue like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars cheered like mad. But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war, scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, ‘To the bottom of the sea, sea, sea' where—”

“Oh, gracious! What shall I say? ”cried Sallie, as Fred ended his rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books. “Well, they went to the bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them, but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights, and kindly pickled them in brine, hoping to discover the mystery about them, for being a woman, she was curious. By-and-by a diver came down, and the mermaid said, ‘I'll give you a box of pearls if you can take it up, ' for she wanted to restore the poor things to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself. So the diver hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls. He left it in a great lonely field, where it was found by a—”

“Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field, ” said Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out. “The little girl was sorry for them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help them. ‘Your geese will tell you, they know everything.' said the old woman. So she asked what she should use for new heads, since the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred mouths and screamed—”

“‘Cabbages! '” continued Laurie promptly. “‘Just the thing, ' said the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. She put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went on their way rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one thought anything of it. The knight in whom I'm interested went back to find the pretty face, and learned that the princesses had spun themselves free and all gone and married, but one. He was in a great state of mind at that, and mounting the colt, who stood by him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle to see which was left. Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden. ‘Will you give me a rose? ' said he. ‘You must come and get it. I can't come to you, it isn't proper, ' said she, as sweet as honey. He tried to climb over the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher. Then he tried to push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he was in despair. So he patiently broke twig after twig till he had made a little hole through which he peeped, saying imploringly, ‘Let me in! Let me in! ' But the pretty princess did not seem to understand, for she picked her roses quietly, and left him to fight his way in. Whether he did or not, Frank will tell you.”

“I can't. I'm not playing, I never do, ” said Frank, dismayed at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the absurd couple. Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was asleep.

“So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is he? ” asked Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing with the wild rose in his buttonhole.

“I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate after a while, ” said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his tutor.

“What a piece of nonsense we have made! With practice we might do something quite clever. Do you know Truth? ” asked Sallie, after they had laughed over their story.

“I hope so, ” said Meg soberly.

“The game, I mean? ”

“What is it? ” said Fred.

“Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out in turn, and the person who draws at the number has to answer truly any question put by the rest. It's great fun.”

“Let's try it, ” said Jo, who liked new experiments.

Miss Kate and Mr. Brooke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred, Sallie, Jo, and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.

“Who are your heroes? ” asked Jo.

“Grandfather and Napoleon.”

“Which lady here do you think prettiest? ” said Sallie.

“Margaret.”

“Which do you like best? ” from Fred.

“Jo, of course.”

“What silly questions you ask! ” And Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at Laurie's matter-of-fact tone.

“Try again; truth isn't a bad game, ” said Fred.

“It's a very good one for you, ” retorted Jo in a low voice. Her turn came next.

“What is your greatest fault? ” asked Fred, by way of testing in her the virtue he lacked himself.

“A quick temper.”

“What do you most wish for? ” said Laurie.

“A pair of boot lacings, ” returned Jo, guessing and defeating his purpose.

“Not a true answer. You must say what you really do want most.”

“Genius. Don't you wish you could give it to me, Laurie? ” And she slyly smiled in his disappointed face.

“What virtues do you most admire in a man? ” asked Sallie.

“Courage and honesty.”

“Now my turn, ” said Fred, as his hand came last.

“Let's give it to him, ” whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded and asked at once—

“Didn't you cheat at croquet? ”

“Well, yes, a little bit.”

“Good!Didn't you take your story out of The Sea-Lion? ”said Laurie.

“Rather.”

“Don't you think the English nation perfect in every respect? ” asked Sallie.

“I should be ashamed of myself if I didn't.”

“He's a true John Bull. Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have a chance without waiting to draw. I'll harrrow up your feelings first by asking if you don't think you are something of a flirt, ” said Laurie, as Jo nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.

“You impertinent boy! Of course I'm not, ” exclaimed Sallie, with an air that proved the contrary.

“What do you hate most? ” asked Fred.

“Spiders and rice pudding.”

“What do you like best? ” asked Jo.

“Dancing and French gloves.”

“Well, I think Truth is a very silly play. Let's have a sensible game of Authors to refresh our minds, ” proposed Jo.

Ned, Frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it went on, the three elders sat apart, talking. Miss Kate took out her sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay on the grass with a book, which he did not read.

“How beautifully you do it! I wish I could draw, ” said Meg, with mingled admiration and regret in her voice.

“Why don't you learn? I should think you had taste and talent for it, ”replied Miss Kate graciously.

“I haven't time.”

“Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy. So did mine, but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons privately, and then she was quite willing I should go on. Can't you do the same with your governess? ”

“I have none.”

“I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with us. Very fine schools they are, too, Papa says. You go to a private one, I suppose? ”

“I don't go at all. I am a governess myself.”

“Oh, indeed! ” said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said, “Dear me, how dreadful! ” for her tone implied it, and something in her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.

Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, “Young ladies in America love independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired and respected for supporting themselves.”

“Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do so. We have many most respectable and worthy young women who do the same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the daughters of gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished, you know, ” said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's pride, and made her work seem not only more distasteful, but degrading.

“Did the German song suit, Miss March? ” inquired Mr. Brooke, breaking an awkward pause.

“Oh, yes! It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever translated it for me.” And Meg's downcast face brightened as she spoke.

“Don't you read German? ” asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.

“Not very well. My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't get on very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation.”

“Try a little now.Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor who loves to teach.” And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile.

“It's so hard I'm afraid to try, ” said Meg, grateful, but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.

“I'll read a bit to encourage you.” And Miss Kate read one of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but perfectly expressionless manner.

Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg, who said innocently, “I thought it was poetry.”

“Some of it is. Try this passage.”

There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he opened at poor Mary's lament.

Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new tutor used to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her musical voice. Down the page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen. If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.

“Very well indeed! ” said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring her many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed “love to teach.”

Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of the little tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with condescension,“You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever reader. I advise you to learn, for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers. I must look after Grace, she is romping.” And Miss Kate strolled away, adding to herself with a shrug, “I didn't come to chaperone a governess, though she is young and pretty.What odd people these Yankees are.I'm afraid Laurie will be quite spoiled among them.”

“I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at governesses and don't treat them as we do, ” said Meg, looking after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression.

“Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know to my sorrow. There's no place like America for us workers, Miss Margaret.” And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that Meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot.

“I'm glad I live in it then. I don't like my work, but I get a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain. I only wished I liked teaching as you do.”

“I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil. I shall be very sorry to lose him next year, ” said Mr. Brooke, busily punching holes in the turf.

“Going to college, I suppose? ” Meg's lips asked the question, but her eyes added, “And what becomes of you? ”

“Yes, it's high time he went, for he is ready; and as soon as he is off, I shall turn soldier. I am needed.”

“I am glad of that! ” exclaimed Meg. “I should think every young man would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers and sisters who stay at home, ” she added sorrowfully.

“I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live or die, ”said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a little grave.

“Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you, ” said Meg heartily.

“Thank you, that sounds pleasant, ” began Mr. Brooke, looking cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.

“Don't you love to ride? ” asked Grace of Amy, as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.

“I dote upon it; my sister Meg used to ride when Papa was rich, but we don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree, ” added Amy, laughing.

“Tell me about Ellen Tree. Is it a donkey? ” asked Grace curiously.

“Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but we've only got an old sidesaddle and no horse. Out in our garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch, so Jo put the saddle on it, fixed some reins on the part that turns up, and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we like.”

“How funny! ” laughed Grace. “I have a pony at home, and ride nearly every day in the park with Fred and Kate; it's very nice, for my friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and gentlemen.”

“Dear, how charming! I hope I shall go abroad some day, but I'd rather go to Rome than the Row, ” said Amy, who had not the remotest idea what the Row was and wouldn't have asked for the world.

Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they were saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of comical gymnastics. Beth, who was collecting the scattered Author cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, “I'm afraid you are tired; can I do anything for you? ”

“Talk to me, please; it's dull, sitting by myself, ” answered Frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.

If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful Beth; but there was no place to run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.

“What do you like to talk about? ” she asked, fumbling over the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.

“Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting, ” said Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to his strength.

“My heart! What shall I do? I don't know anything about them, ”thought Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry, she said, hoping to make him talk, “I never saw any hunting, but I suppose you know all about it.”

“I did once; but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping a confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and hounds for me, ” said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself for her innocent blunder.

“Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes, ” she said, turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she had read one of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.

Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious of her sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle of Beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she had begged protection.

“Bless her heart! She pities him, so she is good to him, ” said Jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground.

“I always said she was a little saint, ” added Meg, as if there could be no further doubt of it.

“I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long, ” said Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets out of the acorn cups.

“My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl,when she likes to be, ”said Amy, well pleased at Beth's success. She meant “facinating”, but as Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either word, fastidious sounded well and made a good impression.

An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon. At sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the river, singing at the tops of their voices. Ned, getting sentimental, warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain—





Alone, alone, ah! woe, alone,





and at the lines—





We each are young, we each have a heart,

Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?





he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song.

“How can you be so cruel to me? ” he whispered, under cover of a lively chorus. “You've kept close to that starched-up Englishwoman all day, and now you snub me.”

“I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't help it, ”replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach, for it was quite true that she had shunned him,remembering the Moffat party and the talk after it.

Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying to her rather pettishly, “There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl, is there? ”

“Not a particle, but she's a dear, ” returned Sallie, defending her friend even while confessing her shortcomings.

“She's not a stricken deer anyway, ” said Ned, trying to be witty, and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.

On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with cordial good nights and good-byes, for the Vaughns were going to Canada. As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss Kate looked after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in her voice, “In spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls are very nice when one knows them.”

“I quite agree with you, ” said Mr. Brooke.





CHAPTER 13

CASTLES IN THE AIR


LAURIE LAY luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock, one warm September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were about, but too lazy to go and find out. He was in one of his moods, for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory, and he was wishing he could live it over again. The hot weather made him indolent, and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr. Brooke's patience to the utmost, displeased his grandfather by practicing half the afternoon, frightened the maidservants half out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman about some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general, till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself. Staring up into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash. Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches coming out, as if bound on some expedition.

“What in the world are those girls about now? ” thought Laurie, opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his neighbors. Each wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long staff. Meg had a cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio. All walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.

“Well, that's cool, ” said Laurie to himself, “to have a picnic and never ask me! They can't be going in the boat, for they haven't got the key. Perhaps they forgot it. I'll take it to them, and see what's going on.”

Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time to find one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last discovered in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight when he leaped the fence and ran after them. Taking the shortest way to the boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came, and he went up the hill to take an observation. A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets.

“Here's a landscape! ” thought Laurie, peeping through the bushes, and looking wide-awake and good-natured already.

It was a rather pretty little picture,for the sisters sat together in the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over them, the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot cheeks, and all the little wood people going on with their affairs as if these were no strangers but old friends. Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green. Beth was sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for she made pretty things with them. Amy was sketching a group of ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud. A shadow passed over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he ought to go away because uninvited;yet lingering because home seemed very lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his restless spirit. He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied the wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile.

“May I come in, please? Or shall I be a bother? ” he asked, advancing slowly.

Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once, “Of course you may. We should have asked you before, only we thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this.”

“I always like your games; but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll go away.”

“I've no objection, if you do something. It's against the rules to be idle here, ” replied Meg gravely but graciously.

“Much obliged. I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit, for it's as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there. Shall I sew, read, cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears. I'm ready.” And Laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold.

“Finish this story while I set my heel, ” said Jo, handing him the book.

“Yes'm” was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the “Busy Bee Society”.

The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit.

“Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one? ”

“Would you tell him? ” asked Meg of her sisters.

“He'll laugh, ” said Amy warningly.

“Who cares? ” said Jo.

“I guess he'll like it, ” added Beth.

“Of course I shall! I give you my word I won't laugh. Tell away, Jo,and don't be afraid.”

“The idea of being afraid of you! Well, you see we used to play Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in earnest, all winter and summer.”

“Yes, I know, ” said Laurie, nodding wisely.

“Who told you? ” demanded Jo.

“Spirits.”

“No, I did. I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away, and he was rather dismal. He did like it, so don't scold, Jo, ” said Beth meekly.

“You can't keep a secret. Never mind, it saves trouble now.”

“Go on, please, ” said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her work, looking a trifle displeased.

“Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours? Well, we have tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task and worked at it with a will. The vacation is nearly over, the stints are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle.”

“Yes, I should think so.” And Laurie thought regretfully of his own idle days.

“Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so we bring our work here and have nice times. For the fun of it we bring our things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to climb the hill, and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago. We call this hill the Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away and see the country where we hope to live some time.”

Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky. The sun was low, and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset. Gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.

“How beautiful that is! ” said Laurie softly, for he was quick to see and feel beauty of any kind.

“It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the same, but always splendid, ” replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.

“Jo talks about the country where we hope to live some time—the real country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking. It would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real, and we could ever go to it, ” said Beth musingly.

“There is a lovelier country even than that,where we shall go,by-and-by, when we are good enough, ” answered Meg with her sweetest voice.

“It seems so long to wait, so hard to do. I want to fly away at once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate.”

“You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that, ” said Jo. “I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb and wait, and maybe never get in after all.”

“You'll have me for company, if that's any comfort. I shall have to do a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City. If I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me, won't you, Beth? ”

Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but she said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds, “If people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I think they will get in, for I don't believe there are any locks on that door or any guards at the gate. I always imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river.”

“Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we make could come true, and we could live in them? ” said Jo, after a little pause.

“I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which I'd have, ” said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him.

“You'd have to take your favorite one. What is it? ” asked Meg.

“If I tell mine, will you tell yours? ”

“Yes, if the girls will too.”

“We will. Now, Laurie.”

“After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like to settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose. I'm to be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear me. And I'm never to be bothered about money or business, but just enjoy myself and live for what I like. That's my favorite castle. What's yours, Meg? ”

Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said slowly, “I should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of luxurious things—nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people, and heaps of money. I am to be mistress of it, and manage it as I like, with plenty of servants, so I never need work a bit. How I should enjoy it! For I wouldn't be idle, but do good, and make everyone love me dearly.”

“Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air? ” asked Laurie slyly.

“I said ‘pleasant people', you know.” And Meg carefully tied up her shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.

“Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband and some angelic little children? You know your castle wouldn't be perfect without, ” said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet, and rather scorned romance, except in books.

“You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in yours, ”answered Meg petulantly.

“Wouldn't I though? I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds, rooms piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand, so that my works should be as famous as Laurie's music. I want to do something splendid before I go into my castle—something heroic or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead. I don't know what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day. I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous,that would suit me,so that is my favorite dream.”

“Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and help take care of the family, ” said Beth contentedly.

“Don't you wish for anything else? ” asked Laurie.

“Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied. I only wish we may all keep well and be together, nothing else.”

“I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole world”was Amy's modest desire.

“We're an ambitious set, aren't we? Every one of us, but Beth, wants to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. I do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes, ” said Laurie, chewing grass like a meditative calf.

“I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the door remains to be seen, ” observed Jo mysteriously.

“I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it. Hang college! ”muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.

“Here's mine! ” And Amy waved her pencil.

“I haven't got any, ” said Meg forlornly.

“Yes, you have, ” said Laurie at once.

“Where? ”

“In your face.”

“Nonsense, that's of no use.”

“Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having, ” replied the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little secret which he fancied he knew.

Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and looked across the river with the same expectant expression which Mr. Brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight.

“If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now, ” said Jo, always ready with a plan.

“Bless me! How old I shall be—twenty-seven! ” exclaimed Meg, who felt grown up already, having just reached seventeen.

“You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and Amy twenty-two. What a venerable party! ” said Jo.

“I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that time, but I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall ‘dawdle', Jo.”

“You need a motive, Mother says; and when you get it, she is sure you'll work splendidly.”

“Is she? By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance! ” cried Laurie, sitting up with sudden energy. “I ought to be satisfied to please Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain, you see, and comes hard. He wants me to be an India merchant, as he was, and I'd rather be shot. I hate tea and silk and spices, and every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon they go to the bottom when I own them. Going to college ought to satisfy him, for if I give him four years he ought to let me off from the business. But he's set, and I've got to do just as he did, unless I break away and please myself, as my father did. If there was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman, I'd do it tomorrow.”

Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat into execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up very fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's hatred of subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the world for himself.

“I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home again till you have tried your own way, ” said Jo, whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was excited by what she called “Teddy's Wrongs”.

“That's not right, Jo. You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie mustn't take your bad advice. You should do just what your grandfather wishes, my dear boy, ” said Meg in her most maternal tone. “Do your best at college, and when he sees that you try to please him, I'm sure he won't be hard on you or unjust to you. As you say, there is no one else to stay with and love him, and you'd never forgive yourself if you left him without his permission. Don't be dismal or fret, but do your duty and you'll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke has, by being respected and loved.”

“What do you know about him? ” asked Laurie, grateful for the good advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak.

“Only what your grandpa told us about him—how he took good care of his own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldn't leave her. And how he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never tells anyone, but is just as generous and patient and good as he can be.”

“So he is, dear old fellow! ” said Laurie heartily, as Meg paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story. “It's like Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, and to tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him. Brooke couldn't understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way. He thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for days and days, and went on about you all in flaming style. If ever I do get my wish, you see what I'll do for Brooke.”

“Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out, ” said Meg sharply.

“How do you know I do, Miss? ”

“I can always tell by his face when he goes away. If you have been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly; if you have plagued him, he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted to go back and do his work better.”

“Well, I like that? So you keep an account of my good and bad marks in Brooke's face, do you? I see him bow and smile as he passes your window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph.”

“We haven't. Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said anything! It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and what is said here is said in confidence, you know, ” cried Meg, much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her careless speech.

“I don't tell tales, ” replied Laurie, with his “high and mighty” air, as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. “Only if Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have fair weather for him to report.”

“Please don't be offended. I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be silly. I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you'd be sorry for by-and-by. You are so kind to us, we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think. Forgive me, I meant it kindly.” And Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid.

Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind little hand, and said frankly, “I'm the one to be forgiven. I'm cross and have been out of sorts all day. I like to have you tell me my faults and be sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy sometimes. I thank you all the same.”

Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a fit person to belong to the “Busy Bee Society”. In the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea “to draw, ” and they would just have time to get home to supper.

“May I come again? ” asked Laurie.

“Yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are told to do, ” said Meg, smiling.

“I'll try.”

“Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do. There's a demand for socks just now, ” added Jo, waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.

That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie, standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David, whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much. Remembering the conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully, “I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me, for I am all he has.”





CHAPTER 14

SECRETS


Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began to grow chilly, and the afternoons were short. For two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated on the old sofa, writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her, while Scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of his whiskers. Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the last page was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen, exclaiming—

“There, I've done my best! If this won't suit I shall have to wait till I can do better.”

Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully through, making dashes here and there, and putting in many exclamation points, which looked like little balloons. Then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been. Jo's desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall. In it she kept her papers, and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves. From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript, and putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.

She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road. Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.

If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street; having found the place with some difficulty, she went into the doorway, looked up the dirty stairs, and after standing stock still a minute, suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came. This maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite. On returning for the third time, Jo gave herself a shake, pulled her hat over her eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out.

There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the entrance, and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, “It's like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she'll need someone to help her home.”

In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod. But he followed, asking with an air of sympathy, “Did you have a bad time? ”

“Not very.”

“You got through quickly.”

“Yes, thank goodness! ”

“Why did you go alone? ”

“Didn't want anyone to know.”

“You're the oddest fellow I ever saw. How many did you have out? ”

Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something.

“There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait a week.”

“What are you laughing at? You are up to some mischief, Jo, ” said Laurie, looking mystified.

“So are you. What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard saloon? ”

“Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but a gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing.”

“I'm glad of that.”

“Why? ”

“You can teach me, and then when we play Hamlet, you can be Laertes, and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene.”

Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made several passers-by smile in spite of themselves.

“I'll teach you whether we play Hamlet or not.It's grand fun and will straighten you up capitally. But I don't believe that was your only reason for saying ‘I'm glad' in that decided way; was it now? ”

“No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I hope you never go to such places. Do you? ”

“Not often.”

“I wish you wouldn't.”

“It's no harm, Jo. I have billiards at home, but it's no fun unless you have good players, so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows.”

“Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful boys. I did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends, ” said Jo, shaking her head.

“Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability? ” asked Laurie, looking nettled.

“That depends upon how and where he takes it. I don't like Ned and his set, and wish you'd keep out of it. Mother won't let us have him at our house, though he wants to come. And if you grow like him she won't be willing to have us frolic together as we do now.”

“Won't she? ” asked Laurie anxiously.

“No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them.”

“Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet. I'm not a fashionable party and don't mean to be, but I do like harmless larks now and then, don't you? ”

“Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild, will you? Or there will be an end of all our good times.”

“I'll be a double-distilled saint.”

“I can't bear saints. Just be a simple, honest, respectable boy, and we'll never desert you. I don't know what I should do if you acted like Mr. King's son. He had plenty of money, but didn't know how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his father's name, I believe, and was altogether horrid.”

“You think I'm likely to do the same? Much obliged.”

“No, I don't—oh, dear, no! —but I hear people talking about money being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor. I shouldn't worry then.”

“Do you worry about me, Jo? ”

“A little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes do; for you've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong, I'm afraid it would be hard to stop you.”

Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him, wishing she had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though his lips smiled as if at her warnings.

“Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home? ” he asked presently.

“Of course not. Why? ”

“Because if you are, I'll take a bus; if you're not, I'd like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting.”

“I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely.”

“Very well, then, come on. It's a secret, and if I tell you, you must tell me yours.”

“I haven't got any, ” began Jo, but stopped suddenly, remembering that she had.

“You know you have—you can't hide anything, so up and fess, or I won't tell, ” cried Laurie.

“Is your secret a nice one? ”

“Oh, isn't it! All about people you know, and such fun! You ought to hear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time. Come, you begin.”

“You'll not say anything about it at home, will you? ”

“Not a word.”

“And you won't tease me in private? ”

“I never tease.”

“Yes, you do. You get everything you want out of people. I don't know how you do it, but you are a born wheedler.”

“Thank you. Fire away.”

“Well, I've left two stories with a newspaperman, and he's to give his answer next week, ” whispered Jo, in her confidant's ear.

“Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress! ” cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a dozen Irish children, for they were out of the city now.

“Hush! It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't rest till I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn't want anyone else to be disappointed.”

“It won't fail. Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day. Won't it be fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of our authoress? ”

Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed in, and a friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs.

“Where's your secret? Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe you again, ” she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement.

“I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise not to, so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told you any plummy bit of news I get. I know where Meg's glove is.”

“Is that all? ” said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.

“It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I tell you where it is.”

“Tell, then.”

Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which produced a comical change. She stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, “How do you know? ”

“Saw it.”

“Where? ”

“Pocket.”

“All this time? ”

“Yes, isn't that romantic? ”

“No, it's horrid.”

“Don't you like it? ”

“Of course I don't. It's ridiculous, it won't be allowed. My patience! What would Meg say? ”

“You are not to tell anyone. Mind that.”

“I didn't promise.”

“That was understood, and I trusted you.”

“Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and wish you hadn't told me.”

“I thought you'd be pleased.”

“At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you.”

“You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away.”

“I'd like to see anyone try it, ” cried Jo fiercely.

“So should I! ” And Laurie chuckled at the idea.

“I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that, ” said Jo rather ungratefully.

“Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right, ” suggested Laurie.

No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before her, and finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran. Laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment, for his Atlanta came panting up with flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face.

“I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this splendid air, and not lose my breath. It was capital, but see what a guy it's made me. Go, pick up my things, like a cherub, as you are, ” said Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.

Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and Jo bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again. But someone did pass, and who should it be but Meg, looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls.

“What in the world are you doing here? ” she asked, regarding her disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.

“Getting leaves, ” meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up.

“And hairpins, ” added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's lap.“They grow on this road, Meg; so do combs and brown straw hats.”

“You have been running, Jo. How could you? When will you stop such romping ways? ” said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.

“Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch. Don't try to make me grow up before my time, Meg: it's hard enough to have you change all of a sudden. Let me be a little girl as long as I can.”

As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting to be a woman, and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near. He saw the trouble in her face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking quickly, “Where have you been calling, all so fine? ”

“At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about Belle Moffat's wedding. It was very splendid, and they have gone to spend the winter in Paris. Just think how delightful that must be! ”

“Do you envy her, Meg? ” said Laurie.

“I'm afraid I do.”

“I'm glad of it! ” muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.

“Why? ” asked Meg, looking surprised.

“Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a poor man, ” said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely warning her to mind what she said.

“I shall never ‘go and marry' anyone, ” observed Meg, walking on with great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping stones, and “behaving like children, ” as Meg said to herself, though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on.

For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered. She rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at Meg with a woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner; Laurie and she were always making signs to one another, and talking about “Spread Eagles” till the girls declared they had both lost their wits. On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the window, Meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the sight of Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in Amy's bower. What went on there, Meg could not see, but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers.

“What shall we do with that girl?She never will behave like a young lady, ” sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face.

“I hope she won't; she is so funny and dear as she is, ” said Beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's having secrets with anyone but her.

“It's very trying, but we never can make her commy la fo, ”added Amy, who sat making some new frills for herself, with her curls tied up in a very becoming way—two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike.

In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa, and affected to read.

“Have you anything interesting there? ” asked Meg, with condescension.

“Nothing but a story; won't amount to much, I guess, ” returned Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.

“You'd better read it aloud. That will amuse us and keep you out of mischief, ” said Amy in her most grown-up tone.

“What's the name? ” asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face behind the sheet.

“The Rival Painters.”

“That sounds well; read it, ” said Meg.

With a loud “Hem! ” and a long breath, Jo began to read very fast. The girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic, and somewhat pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end. “I like that about the splendid picture” was Amy's approving remark, as Jo paused.

“I prefer the lovering part. Viola and Angelo are two of our favorite names, isn't that queer? ” said Meg, wiping her eyes, for the “lovering part”was tragical.

“Who wrote it? ” asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's face.

The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying a flushed countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice, “Your sister.”

“You? ” cried Meg, dropping her work.

“It's very good, ” said Amy critically.

“I knew it! I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud! ” and Beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success.

Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! How Meg wouldn't believe it till she saw the words, “Miss Josephine March, ” actually printed in the paper. How graciously Amy criticized the artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which unfortunately couldn't be carried out, as the hero and heroine were dead. How Beth got excited, and skipped and sang with joy. How Hannah came in to exclaim “Sakes alive, well I never! ”in great astonishment at “that Jo's doin's”; how proud Mrs. March was when she knew it. How Jo laughed, with tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it, and how the “Spread Eagle” might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the paper passed from hand to hand.

“Tell us about it.” “When did it come? ” “How much did you get for it? ” “What will Father say? ” “Won't Laurie laugh? ” cried the family, all in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for these foolish, affectionate people made a jubilee of every little household joy.

“Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything, ” said Jo, wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her Evelina than she did over her“Rival Painters”. Having told how she disposed of her tales, Jo added, “And when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and noticed the stories. It was good practice, he said, and when the beginners improved, anyone would pay. So I let him have the two stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him; and he said it was good, and I shall write more, and he's going to get the next paid for, and I am so happy,for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls.”

Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the paper, she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears, for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end.





CHAPTER 15

A TELEGRAM


“NOVEMBER IS THE most disagreeable month in the whole year, ”said Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon, looking out at the frostbitten garden.

“That's the reason I was born in it, ” observed Jo pensively, quite unconscious of the blot on her nose.

“If something very pleasant should happen now, we should think it a delightful month, ” said Beth, who took a hopeful view of everything, even November.

“I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family, ” said Meg, who was out of sorts. “We go grubbing along day after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun. We might as well be in a treadmill.”

“My patience, how blue we are! ” cried Jo. “I don't much wonder, poor dear, for you see other girls having splendid times, while you grind, grind, year in and year out. Oh, don't I wish I could manage things for you as I do for my heroines! You're pretty enough and good enough already, so I'd have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly. Then you'd dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance.”

“People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays, men have to work and women marry for money. It's a dreadfully unjust world, ”said Meg bitterly.

“Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all; just wait ten years, and see if we don't, ” said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and faces.

“Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and dirt, though I'm grateful for your good intentions.”

Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again; Jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude, but Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other window, said, smiling,“Two pleasant things are going to happen right away. Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell.”

In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, “Any letter from Father, girls? ” and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, “Won't some of you come for a drive? I've been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn. It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad, and I'm going to take Brooke home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn't out. Come, Jo, you and Beth will go, won't you? ”

“Of course we will.”

“Much obliged, but I'm busy.” And Meg whisked out her workbasket, for she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least, not to drive too often with the young gentleman.

“We three will be ready in a minute, ” cried Amy, running away to wash her hands.

“Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother? ” asked Laurie, leaning over Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her.

“No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind, dear. It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been. Father is as regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps.”

A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in with a letter.

“It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum, ” she said, handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.

At the word “telegraph”, Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart. Laurie dashed downstairs for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read aloud, in a frightened voice—





Mrs. March,

Your husband is very ill. Come at once.

S. HALE

Blank Hospital, Washington





How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how strangely the day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them. Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over, and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never forgot, “I shall go at once, but it may be too late. Oh, children, children, help me to bear it! ”

For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears. Poor Hannah was the first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example, for with her, work was panacea for most afflictions.

“The Lord keep the dear man! I won't waste no time a-cryin', but git your things ready right away, mum, ” she said heartily, as she wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one.

“She's right, there's no time for tears now. Be calm, girls, and let me think.”

They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up, looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan for them.

“Where's Laurie? ” she asked presently, when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.

“Here, ma'am. Oh, let me do something! ” cried the boy, hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.

“Send a telegram saying I will come at once. The next train goes early in the morning. I'll take that.”

“What else? The horses are ready. I can go anywhere, do anything, ” he said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.

“Leave a note at Aunt March's. Jo, give me that pen and paper.”

Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages, Jo drew the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do anything to add a little to the sum for her father.

“Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate pace. there is no need of that.”

Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his life.

“Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come. On the way get these things. I'll put them down, they'll be needed and I must go prepared for nursing. Hospital stores are not always good. Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine. I'm not too proud to beg for Father. He shall have the best of everything. Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and Meg, come and help me find my things, for I'm half bewildered.”

Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while, and let them work. Everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of wind, and the quiet, happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell.

Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mother's absence, which comforted her very much. There was nothing he didn't offer, from his own dressing gown to himself as escort. But the last was impossible. Mrs. March would not hear of the old gentleman's undertaking the long journey, yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it, for anxiety ill fits one for traveling. He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and marched abruptly away, saying he'd be back directly. No one had time to think of him again till, as Meg ran through the entry, with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other, she came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.

“I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March, ” he said, in the kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit. “I came to offer myself as escort to your mother. Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there.”

Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following, as Meg put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr. Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take.

“How kind you all are! Mother will accept, I'm sure, and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her. Thank you very, very much! ”

Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother.

Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a note from Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd for March to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time. Mrs. March put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she had been there.

The short afternoon wore away. All other errands were done, and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while Beth and Amy got tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what she called “a slap and a bang”, but still Jo did not come. They began to get anxious, and Laurie went off to find her, for no one knew what freak Jo might take into her head. He missed her, however, and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance, for there was a mixture of fun and fear, satisfaction and regret in it, which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a little choke in her voice, “That's my contribution toward making Father comfortable and bringing him home! ”

“My dear, where did you get it? Twenty-five dollars! Jo, I hope you haven't done anything rash? ”

“No, it's mine honestly. I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it. I earned it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what was my own.”

As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.

“Your hair! Your beautiful hair! ” “Oh, Jo, how could you? Your one beauty.” “My dear girl, there was no need of this.” “She doesn't look like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it! ”

As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle, and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it, “It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth. It will be good for my vanity, I was getting too proud of my wig. It will do my brains good to have that mop taken off. My head feels deliciously light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop, which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order. I'm satisfied, so please take the money and let's have supper.”

“Tell me all about it, Jo. I am not quite satisfied, but I can't blame you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as you call it, to your love. But, my dear, it was not necessary, and I'm afraid you will regret it one of these days, ” said Mrs. March.

“No, I won't! ” returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned.

“What made you do it? ” asked Amy, who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair.

“Well, I was wild to do something for Father, ” replied Jo, as they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble. “I hate to borrow as much as Mother does, and I knew Aunt March would croak; she always does, if you ask for a ninepence. Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and I only got some clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound to have some money, if I sold the nose off my face to get it.”

“You needn't feel wicked, my child: you had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings, ” said Mrs. March with a look that warmed Jo's heart.

“I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I went along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself. In a barber's window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars. It came to me all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for mine.”

“I don't see how you dared to do it, ” said Beth in a tone of awe.

“Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair. He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair. He said he didn't care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never paid much for it in the first place. The work put into it made it dear, and so on. It was getting late, and I was afraid if it wasn't done right away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you know when I start to do a thing, I hate to give it up. So I begged him to take it, and told him why I was in such a hurry. It was silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for I got rather excited, and told the story in my topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and said so kindly, ‘Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady; I'd do as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling.'”

“Who was Jimmy? ” asked Amy, who liked to have things explained as they went along.

“Her son, she said, who was in the army. How friendly such things make strangers feel, don't they? She talked away all the time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely.”

“Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came? ” asked Meg, with a shiver.

“I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that was the end of it. I never snivel over trifles like that. I will confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair laid out on the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head. It almost seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off. The woman saw me look at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep. I'll give it to you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so comfortable I don't think I shall ever have a mane again.”

Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk. She only said, “Thank you, deary, ” but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the happy times they would have when Father came home to be nursed.

No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put by the last finished job, and said, “Come girls.” Beth went to the piano and played the father's favorite hymn. All began bravely, but broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler.

“Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get. Good night, my darlings, ” said Mrs. March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.

They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room. Beth and Amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life. Jo lay motionless, and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled sob made her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek—

“Jo, dear, what is it? Are you crying about father? ”

“No, not now.”

“What then? ”

“My—My hair! ” burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow.

It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.

“I'm not sorry, ” protested Jo, with a choke. “I'd do it again tomorrow, if I could. It's only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way. Don't tell anyone, it's all over now. I thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my one beauty. How came you to be awake? ”

“I can't sleep, I'm so anxious, ” said Meg.

“Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off.”

“I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever.”

“What did you think of? ”

“Handsome faces—eyes particularly, ” answered Meg, smiling to herself in the dark.

“What color do you like best? ”

“Brown—that is, sometimes. Blue are lovely.”

Jo laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then amiably promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air.

The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here, settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter. As she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant face, which seemed to whisper in the silence, “Be comforted, dear soul! There is always light behind the clouds.”





CHAPTER 16

LETTERS


IN THE COLD gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before. For now the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went down—so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within. Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution. Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.

Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag—

“Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's protection. Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don't grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless.”

“Yes, Mother.”

“Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and, in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don't get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to help and cheer all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and you, Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.”

“We will, Mother! We will! ”

The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well. No one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.

Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him “Mr. Greatheart” on the spot.

“Good-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all! ” whispered Mrs. March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried into the carriage.

As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it also, and smiled and waved their hands; and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.

“How kind everyone is to us! ” she said, turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.

“I don't see how they can help it, ” returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.

“I feel as if there had been an earthquake, ” said Jo, as their neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.

“It seems as if half the house was gone, ” added Meg forlornly.

Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It was a little thing, but it went straight to their hearts; and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.

Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with a coffeepot.

“Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don't fret. Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's fall to work and be a credit to the family.”

Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. They drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes were all right again.

“‘Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see who will remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won't she lecture though! ” said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.

“I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and attend to things here, ” said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her eyes so red.

“No need of that. Beth and I can keep house perfectly well, ” put in Amy, with an important air.

“Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything nice when you come home, ” added Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub without delay.

“I think anxiety is very interesting, ” observed Amy, eating sugar pensively.

The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl.

The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again, and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosy-faced mandarin.

“That's so like my Beth! ” said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face.“Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain today. Don't fret about Father, dear, ” she added, as they parted.

“And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair is becoming, and it looks very boyish and nice, ” returned Meg, trying not to smile at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister's shoulders.

“That's my only comfort.” And, touching her hat à la Laurie, away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.

News from their father comforted the girls very much, for though dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which grew more cheerful as the week passed. At first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and read them:





My Dearest Mother,

It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father. The girls are all as good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if I didn't know her “moral fit” wouldn't last long. Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told her. She grieves about Father, and looks sober except when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint. She does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss “Margaret”, which is quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We are all well and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own.

MEG





This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed letters:





My Precious Marmee,

Three cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank God for being so good to us, but I could only cry, and say, “I'm glad! I'm glad! ” Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so desperately good, it's like living in a nest of turtledoves. You'd laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I—well, I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't and got mad. It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon. But I thought he'd come to it, for I was in the right. He didn't come, and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.

I made a “pome” yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash, and as Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him. Give him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times for your—

TOPSY-TURVY JO





A SONG FROM THE SUDS

Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,

While the white foam rises high;

And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,

And fasten the clothes to dry;

Then out in the free fresh air they swing,

Under the sunny sky.





I wish we could wash from our hearts and souls

The stains of the week away,

And let water and air by their magic make

Ourselves as pure as they;

Then on the earth there would be indeed,

A glorious washing-day!





Along the path of a useful life,

Will heartsease ever bloom;

The busy mind has no time to think

Of sorrow or care or gloom;

And anxious thoughts may be swept away,

As we bravely wield a broom.





I am glad a task to me is given,

To labor at day by day;

For it brings me health and strength and hope,

And I cheerfully learn to say, —

“Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,

But, Hand, you shall work alway! ”





Dear Mother,

There is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to see. I read every morning, try to be good all day, and sing myself to sleep with Father's tune. I can't sing “LAND OF THE LEAL” now, it makes me cry. Everyone is very kind, and we are as happy as we can be without you. Amy wants the rest of the page, so I must stop. I didn't forget to cover the holders, and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day.

Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine. Oh, do come soon to your loving.

LITTLE BETH





Ma Chere Mamma,

We are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate the girls—Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words and you can take the properest. Meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because it keeps me sweet tempered. Laurie is not as respeckful as he ought to be now I am almost in my teens, he calls me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King does. The sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out, and Meg put in new ones, but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress. I felt bad but did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more starch in my aprons and have buckwheats every day. Can't she? Didn't I make that interrigation point nice? Meg says my punchtuation and spelling are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but dear me I have so many things to do, I can't stop. Adieu, I send heaps of love to Papa.

Your affectionate daughter

AMY CURTIS MARCH





Dear Mis March,

I jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The girls is clever and fly round right smart. Miss Meg is going to make a proper good housekeeper. She hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin ahead, but she don't stop to cal'k'late fust, and you never know where she's like to bring up. She done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she starched em afore they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should a died a laughin. Beth is the best of little creeters, and a sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She tries to learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her years, likewise keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful. We have got on very economical so fur. I don't let the girls hev coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well without frettin, wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes as usual, and turns the house upside down frequent, but he heartens the girls, so I let em hev full swing. The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin, but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread is riz, so no more at this time. I send my duty to Mr. March, and hope he's seen the last of his Pewmonia.

Yours respectful

CHAPTER 17

LITTLE FAITHFUL


FOR A WEEK the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood. It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old ways. They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.

Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March didn't like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the Washington dispatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.

All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs.

All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and deserved praise. So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.

“Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels; you know Mother told us not to forget them.” said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's departure.

“I'm too tired to go this afternoon, ” replied Meg, rocking comfortably as she sewed.

“Can't you, Jo? ” asked Beth.

“Too stormy for me with my cold.”

“I thought it was almost well.”

“It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to go to the Hummels', ” said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency.

“Why don't you go yourself? ” asked Meg.

“I have been every day,but the baby is sick,and I don't know what to do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of it;but it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to go.”

Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.

“Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air will do you good, ” said Jo, adding apologetically, “I'd go but I want to finish my writing.”

“My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go, ” said Beth.

“Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us, ” suggested Meg.

So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and the Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed: Amy did not come, Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story, and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes. It was late when she came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room. Half an hour after, Jo went to “Mother's closet” for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.

“Christopher Columbus! What's the matter? ” cried Jo, as Beth put out her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly, “You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you? ”

“Years ago, when Meg did. Why? ”

“Then I'll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby's dead! ”

“What baby? ”

“Mrs. Hummel's; it died in my lap before she got home, ” cried Beth with a sob.

“My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone, ” said Jo, taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's big chair, with a remorseful face.

“It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute it was sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden it gave a little cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was dead.”

“Don't cry, dear! What did you do? ”

“I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor. He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore throats.‘Scarlet fever, ma'am. Ought to have called me before, ' he said crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay. He smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right away, or I'd have the fever.”

“No, you won't! ” cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look.“Oh,Beth,if you should be sick I never could forgive myself!What shall we do? ”

“Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked in Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel better, ” said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well.

“If Mother was only at home! ” exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She read a page, looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said gravely, “You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and among the others who are going to have it,so I'm afraid you are going to have it,Beth.I'll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.”

“Don't let Amy come; she never had it, and I should hate to give it to her. Can't you and Meg have it over again? ” asked Beth, anxiously.

“I guess not; don't care if I do; serve me right, selfish pig, to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself! ” muttered Jo, as she went to consult Hannah.

The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died—all of which Jo believed, and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.

“Now I'll tell you what we'll do, ” said Hannah, when she had examined and questioned Beth, “we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at you, dear, and see that we start right. Then we'll send Amy off to Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.”

“I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest, ” began Meg, looking anxious and self-reproachful.

“I shall, because it's my fault she is sick. I told Mother I'd do the errands, and I haven't, ” said Jo decidedly.

“Which will you have, Beth? There ain't no need of but one, ” said Hannah.

“Jo, please.” And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look, which effectually settled that point.

“I'll go and tell Amy, ” said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.

Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, and commanded:all in vain.Amy protested that she would not go,and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head in the sofa cushions. She told her story, expecting to be consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, “Now be a sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what a jolly plan I've got. You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times. Won't that be better than moping here? ”

“I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way, ” began Amy, in an injured voice.

“Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want to be sick, do you? ”

“No, I'm sure I don't; but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with Beth all the time.”

“That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss.”

“But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross, ” said Amy, looking rather frightened.

“It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is, and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I'll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, whatever we do.”

“Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck? ”

“On my honor as a gentleman.”

“And come every single day? ”

“See if I don't! ”

“And bring me back the minute Beth is well? ”

“The identical minute.”

“And go to the theater, truly? ”

“A dozen theaters, if we may.”

“Well—I guess—I will, ” said Amy slowly.

“Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in, ” said Laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the “giving in.”

Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.

“How is the little dear? ” asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.

“She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety, ” answered Meg.

“What a trying world it is! ” said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful way. “No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another. There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother's gone, so I'm all at sea.”

“Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do anything? ” asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friend's one beauty.

“That is what troubles me, ” said Meg. “I think we ought to tell her if Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother can't leave Father, and it will only make them anxious. Beth won't be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me.”

“Hum, well, I can't say. Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor has been.”

“We will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once, ” commanded Meg. “We can't decide anything till he has been.”

“Stay where you are, Jo. I'm errand boy to this establishment, ” said Laurie, taking up his cap.

“I'm afraid you are busy, ” began Meg.

“No, I've done my lessons for the day.”

“Do you study in vacation time? ” asked Jo.

“I follow the good example my neighbors set me” was Laurie's answer, as he swung himself out of the room.

“I have great hopes for my boy” observed Jo, watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile.

“He does very well—for a boy” was Meg's somewhat ungracious answer, for the subject did not interest her.

Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story. Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.

Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.

“What do you want now? ” she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles, while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out—

“Go away. No boys allowed here.”

Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.

“No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't sick, which I've no doubt she will be—looks like it now. Don't cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff.”

Amy was on the point of crying,but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out, “Bless my boots! ” in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.

“What do you hear from your mother? ” asked the old lady gruffly.

“Father is much better, ” replied Jo, trying to keep sober.

“Oh, is he? Well, that won't last long, I fancy. March never had any stamina, ” was the cheerful reply.

“Ha, ha! Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye! ”squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.

“Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! And, Jo, you'd better go at once; it isn't proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like—”

“Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! ” cried Polly, tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the “rattlepated” boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.

“I don't think I can bear it,but I'll try, ”thought Amy,as she was left alone with Aunt March.

“Get along, you fright! ” screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy could not restrain a sniff.





CHAPTER 18

DARK DAYS


BETH DID HAVE the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and the doctor suspected. The girls knew nothing about illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had everything her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a good deal to the excellent nurse. Meg stayed at home, lest she should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of Beth's illness. She could not think it right to deceive her mother, but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of “Mrs. March bein' told, and worried just for sech a trifle.”Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself. But there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother. Then Jo grew frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even Hannah said she“would think of it,though there was no danger yet.”A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr. March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a long while.

How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house, and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited, while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home! Then it was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buy—in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of life. Then it was that Jo, living in the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of Beth's nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth, or beauty. And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home, that she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. Laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locked the grand piano, because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him. Everyone missed Beth. The milkman, baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did, poor Mrs. Hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes, and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little Beth had made.

Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protégé. She longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they should get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about Jo. She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that Father might not think she had neglected him. But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment. Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo never stirred from Beth's side.

The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready for its death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, in a low voice to Hannah,“If Mrs.March can leave her husband she'd better be sent for.”

Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously, Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale face for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm. She was soon back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again. Jo read it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart, and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly, “What is it? Is Beth worse? ”

“I've sent for Mother, ” said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression.

“Good for you, Jo! Did you do it on your own responsibility? ” asked Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook.

“No. The doctor told us to.”

“Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that? ” cried Laurie, with a startled face.

“Yes, it is. She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall. She doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it. Mother and Father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find Him.”

As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark, and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat, “I'm here. Hold on to me, Jo, dear! ”

She could not speak, but she did “hold on, ” and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble. Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no fitting words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do. It was the best thing he could have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow. Soon she dried the tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful face.

“Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now. I don't feel so forlorn, and will try to bear it if it comes.”

“Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo. Soon your mother will be here, and then everything will be all right.”

“I'm so glad Father is better. Now she won't feel so bad about leaving him. Oh, me! It does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders, ” sighed Jo, spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.

“Doesn't Meg pull fair? ” asked Laurie, looking indignant.

“Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Beth as I do, and she won't miss her as I shall.Beth is my conscience,and I can't give her up.I can't!I can't! ”

Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear. Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad of it. Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, “I don't think she will die. She's so good, and we all love her so much, I don't believe God will take her away yet.”

“The good and dear people always do die, ” groaned Jo, but she stopped crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears.

“Poor girl, you're worn out. It isn't like you to be forlorn. Stop a bit. I'll hearten you up in a jiffy.”

Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it. It must have possessed some magic, for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, “I drink— Health to my Beth! You are a good doctor,Teddy,and such a comfortable friend.How can I ever pay you? ”she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind.

“I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you something that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine, ” said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something.

“What is it? ” cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.

“I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered she'd come at once, and she'll be here tonight, and everything will be all right. Aren't you glad I did it? ”

Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or harming Beth. Jo grew quite white, flew out of her chair, and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful cry, “Oh, Laurie! Oh, Mother! I am so glad! ” She did not weep again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news.

Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great presence of mind. He patted her back soothingly, and finding that she was recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which brought Jo round at once. Holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying breathlessly,“Oh, don't! I didn't mean to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't help flying at you. Tell me all about it, and don't give me wine again, it makes me act so.”

“I don't mind, ” laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie. “Why, you see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa. We thought Hannah was overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought to know. She'd never forgive us if Beth—Well, if anything happened, you know. So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something, and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram.I never can bear to be‘lorded over, 'so that settled my mind, and I did it. Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in at two a.m. I shall go for her, and you've only got to bottle up your rapture, and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here.”

“Laurie, you're an angel! How shall I ever thank you? ”

“Fly at me again; I rather liked it, ” said Laurie, looking mischievous—a thing he had not done for a fortnight.

“No, thank you. I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes. Don't tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night. Bless you,Teddy, bless you! ”

Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech, she vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was“happy, oh,so happy! ”while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it.

“That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive him and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away, ” said Hannah, with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news.

Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter, while Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah “knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected.” A breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms. Everything appeared to feel the hopeful change; Beth's bird began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's bush in the window. The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness, and every time the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another, whispering encouragingly, “Mother's coming, dear! Mother's coming! ”Every one rejoiced but Beth; she lay in that heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger. It was a piteous sight—the once rosy face so changed and vacant, the once busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips quite dumb, and the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow. All day she lay so, only rousing now and then to mutter, “Water! ” with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word. All day Jo and Meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and Mother; and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged slowly by. But night came at last, and every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. The doctor had been in to say that some change, for better or worse, would probably take place about midnight, at which time he would return.

Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's foot and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the parlor, feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than Mrs. March's anxious countenance as she entered, Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.

The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.

“If God spares Beth, I never will complain again, ” whispered Meg earnestly.

“If God spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my life, ”answered Jo, with equal fervor.

“I wish I had no heart, it aches so, ” sighed Meg, after a pause.

“If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever shall get through it, ” added her sister despondently.

Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. The house was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush. Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. An hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie's quiet departure for the station. Another hour—still no one came, and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way, or, worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the poor girls.

It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard a movement by the bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling before their mother's easy chair with her face hidden. A dreadful fear passed coldly over Jo, as she thought, “Beth is dead, and Meg is afraid to tell me.”

She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place. The fever flush and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters, she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly whispered, “Good-by, my Beth. Good-by! ”

As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, “The fever's turned, she's sleepin' nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes easy. Praise be given! Oh, my goodness me! ”

Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor came to confirm it. He was a homely man, but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look at them, “Yes, my dears, I think the little girl will pull through this time. Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes, give her—”

What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words. When they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying, as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep.

“If Mother would only come now! ” said Jo, as the winter night began to wane.

“See, ” said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose, “I thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand tomorrow if she—went away from us. But it has blossomed in the night, and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little rose, and Mother's face.”

Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo, as they looked out in the early morning, when their long, sad vigil was done.

“It looks like a fairy world, ” said Meg, smiling to herself, as she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.

“Hark! ” cried Jo, starting to her feet.

Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from Hannah, and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper, “Girls, she's come! She's come! ”





CHAPTER 19

AMY'S WILL


WHILE THESE THINGS were happening at home, Amy was having hard times at Aunt March's. She felt her exile deeply, and, for the first time in her life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. Aunt March never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt March had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children, though she didn't think it proper to confess it. She really did her best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made! Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way. But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried Amy very much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy talks. Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister, the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence. So she took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago—a process which carried dismay to Amy's soul, and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider.

She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the old-fashioned spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till they shone. Then she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was! Not a speck escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving, which was never dusted to suit. Then Polly had to be fed, the lap dog combed, and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders, for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair. After these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed. Then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it? Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode and had capital times. After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as she dropped off over the first page. Then patchwork or towels appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime. The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.

If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid, she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time. The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. He pulled her hair whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird. Then she could not endure the dog—a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. The cook was bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady.

Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with “Madame”, as she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change her religion. She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces. She also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy's chief delight was an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring, too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all.

“Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will? ” asked Esther, who always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.

“I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them, and I'm fond of necklaces, they are so becoming. I should choose this if I might, ”replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same.

“I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace; ah, no! To me it is a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good Catholic, ” said Esther, eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.

“Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling wooden beads hanging over your glass? ” asked Amy.

“Truly, yes, to pray with. It would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a vain bijou.”

“You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. I wish I could.”

“If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort; but as that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served before Madame. She had a little chapel and in it found solacement for much trouble.”

“Would it be right for me to do so too? ” asked Amy, who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there to remind her of it.

“It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it. Say nothing to Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve your sister.”

Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.

“I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when Aunt March dies, ” she said, as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one.

“To you and your sisters. I know it, Madame confides in me. I witnessed her will, and it is to be so, ” whispered Esther smiling.

“How nice! But I wish she'd let us have them now. Procrastination is not agreeable, ” observed Amy, taking a last look at the diamonds.

“It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. The first one who is affianced will have the pearls—Madame has said it; and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and charming manners.”

“Do you think so? Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that lovely ring! It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's. I do like Aunt March after all.” And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it.

From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training. Esther fitted up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. She thought it was of no great value, but, being appropriate, she borrowed it, well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor care if she did. It was, however, a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world, and Amy's beauty-loving eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the Divine Mother, while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart. On the table she laid her little Testament and hymnbook, kept a vase always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every day to “sit alone, thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear God to preserve her sister.” Esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.

The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left alone outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender Friend, whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children. She missed her mother's help to understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look, she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly. But, Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden seemed very heavy. She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be satisfied with doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it. In her first effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will,as Aunt March had done,so that if she did fall ill and die, her possessions might be justly and generously divided. It cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old lady's jewels.

During one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could, with some help from Esther as to certain legal terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman had signed her name, Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show Laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness. As it was a rainy day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers, and took Polly with her for company. In this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes with which Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears. So busy was she on this day that she did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat. She was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on high-heeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit, with Polly sidling and bridling just behind her, imitating her as well as he could, and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, “Ain't we fine? Get along, you fright! Hold your tongue! Kiss me, dear! Ha! Ha! ”

Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment, lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously received.

“Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want to consult you about a very serious matter, ” said Amy, when she had shown her splendor and driven Polly into a corner. “That bird is the trial of my life, ”she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while Laurie seated himself astride a chair. “Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as a mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage; so I went to let him out, and found a big spider there. I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase. Polly marched straight after it, stooped down and peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a cock of his eye, ‘Come out and take a walk, my dear.' I couldn't help laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both.”

“Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation? ” asked Laurie, yawning.

“Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, ‘Catch her! Catch her! Catch her! ' as I chased the spider.”

“That's a lie! Oh, lor! ” cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's toes.

“I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment, ” cried Laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely croaked, “Allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear! ”

“Now I'm ready, ” said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket. “I want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is legal and right. I felt I ought to do it, for life is uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my tomb.”

Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the spelling:





MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT





I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all my earthly property—viz. to wit:—namely

To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art, including frames. Also my $100, to do what he likes with.

To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets—also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.

To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her “little girl”.

To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax, also my bronze inkstand—she lost the cover—and my most precious plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.

To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the little bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if she can wear them being thin when she gets well. And I herewith also leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.

To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my paper mashay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn't any neck. Also in return for his great kindness in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes, Noter Dame is the best.

To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family, especially Beth.

I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.

To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork I leave hoping she “will remember me, when it you see.”

And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead. I forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. Amen.

To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this 20th day of Nov. Anni Domino 1861.

AMY CURTIS MARCH

Witnesses:

ESTELLE VALNOR

THEODORE LAURENCE





The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.

“What put it into your head? Did anyone tell you about Beth's giving away her things? ” asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.

She explained and then asked anxiously, “What about Beth? ”

“I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you. She felt so ill one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg, her cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for her sake. She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of us, and her best love to Grandpa.She never thought of a will.”

Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper. Amy's face was full of trouble, but she only said, “Don't people put sort of postscripts to their wills, sometimes? ”

“Yes, ‘codicils', they call them.”

“Put one in mine then,that I wish all my curls cut off,and given round to my friends. I forgot it, but I want it done though it will spoil my looks.”

Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice. Then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips, “Is there really any danger about Beth? ”

“I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't cry, dear.”And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting.

When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting in the twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart, feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister.





CHAPTER 20

CONFIDENTIAL


I DON'T THINK I have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters. Such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and Mother's face. Too weak to wonder at anything, she only smiled and nestled close in the loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry longing was satisfied at last. Then she slept again, and the girls waited upon their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which clung to hers even in sleep.

Hannah had “dished up” an astonishing breakfast for the traveler, finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any other way, and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young storks, while they listened to her whispered account of Father's state, Mr. Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the unspeakable comfort Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.

What a strange yet pleasant day that was! So brilliant and gay without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow; so quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent with watching, and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house, while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door. With a blissful sense of burdens lifted off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes, and lay at rest, like storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a quiet harbor. Mrs. March would not leave Beth's side, but rested in the big chair, waking often to look at, touch, and brood over her child, like a miser over some recovered treasure.

Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his story so well that Aunt March actually “sniffed” herself, and never once said “I told you so.” Amy came out so strong on this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel really began to bear fruit. She dried her tears quickly, restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never even thought of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie's opinion, that she behaved “like a capital little woman.” Even Polly seemed impressed, for he called her “a good girl”, blessed her buttons, and begged her to “come and take a walk, dear, ” in his most affable tone. She would very gladly have gone out to enjoy the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. She was a long time about it, and when she returned, he was stretched out with both arms under his head, sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.

After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake up till night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been effectually roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother. There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her mother's lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. They were alone together in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its purpose was explained to her.

“On the contrary, I like it very much, dear, ” looking from the dusty rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen. “It is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. There are a good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. I think my little girl is learning this.”

“Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture which I've tried to make. The woman's face is not good—it's too beautiful for me to draw—but the baby is done better, and I love it very much. I like to think He was a little child once, for then I don't seem so far away, and that helps me.”

As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's knee, Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. She said nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after a minute's pause, she added gravely, “I wanted to speak to you about this, but I forgot it. Aunt gave me the ring today; she called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger, and said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me always. She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it's too big. I'd like to wear them Mother, can I? ”

“They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young for such ornaments, Amy, ” said Mrs. March, looking at the plump little hand, with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together.

“I'll try not to be vain, ” said Amy. “I don't think I like it only because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl in the story wore her bracelet, to remind me of something.”

“Do you mean Aunt March? ” asked her mother, laughing.

“No, to remind me not to be selfish.” Amy looked so earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing, and listened respectfully to the little plan.

“I've thought a great deal lately about my ‘bundle of naughties', and being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm going to try hard to cure it, if I can. Beth isn't selfish, and that's the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. People wouldn't feel so bad about me if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them; but I'd like to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm going to try and be like Beth all I can. I'm apt to forget my resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me, I guess I should do better. May I try this way? ”

“Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet. Wear your ring, dear, and do your best. I think you will prosper, for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle. Now I must go back to Beth. Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will soon have you home again.”

That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report the traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room, and finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting her fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided look.

“What is it, deary? ” asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand, with a face which invited confidence.

“I want to tell you something, Mother.”

“About Meg? ”

“How quickly you guessed! Yes, it's about her, and though it's a little thing, it fidgets me.”

“Beth is asleep; speak low, and tell me all about it. That Moffat hasn't been here, I hope? ” asked Mrs. March rather sharply.

“No. I should have shut the door in his face if he had, ” said Jo, settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet. “Last summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only one was returned. We forgot all about it, till Teddy told me that Mr. Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn't dare say so,she was so young and he so poor.Now,isn't it a dreadful state of things? ”

“Do you think Meg cares for him? ” asked Mrs. March, with an anxious look.

“Mercy me! I don't know anything about love and such nonsense! ”cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. “In novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting away, growing thin, and acting like fools. Now Meg does not do anything of the sort: she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes about lovers. I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me as he ought.”

“Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John? ”

“Who? ” cried Jo, staring.

“Mr. Brooke. I call him ‘John' now; we fell into the way of doing so at the hospital, and he likes it.”

“Oh, dear! I know you'll take his part: he's been good to Father, and you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if she wants to. Mean thing! To go petting Papa and helping you, just to wheedle you into liking him.” And Jo pulled her hair again with a wrathful tweak.

“My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how it happened. John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and was so devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond of him. He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. He only wanted our leave to love her and work for her, and the right to make her love him if he could. He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse to listen to him, but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself so young.”

“Of course not. It would be idiotic! I knew there was mischief brewing. I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined. I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the family.”

This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said gravely,“Jo, I confide in you and don't wish you to say anything to Meg yet. When John comes back, and I see them together, I can judge better of her feelings toward him.”

“She'll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and then it will be all up with her. She's got such a soft heart, it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly at her. She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly name, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together. I see it all! They'll go lovering around the house, and we shall have to dodge; Meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more; Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off, and make a hole in the family; and I shall break my heart, and everything will be abominably uncomfortable. Oh, dear me! Why weren't we all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother.”

Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible John. Mrs. March sighed, and Jo looked up with an air of relief.

“You don't like it, Mother? I'm glad of it. Let's send him about his business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be happy together as we always have been.”

“I did wrong to sigh, Jo. It is natural and right you should all go to homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls as long as I can;and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for Meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before John can make a home for her. Your father and I have agreed that she shall not bind herself in any way, nor be married, before twenty. If she and John love one another, they can wait, and test the love by doing so. She is conscientious, and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly. My pretty, tender hearted girl! I hope things will go happily with her.”

“Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man? ” asked Jo, as her mother's voice faltered a little over the last words.

“Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls will never feel the need of it too bitterly, nor be tempted by too much. I should like to know that John was firmly established in some good business, which gave him an income large enough to keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable. I'm not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name for my girls. If rank and money come with love and virtue, also, I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune; but I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can be had in a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. I am content to see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be rich in the possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than a fortune.”

“I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I'm disappointed about Meg, for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and sit in the lap of luxury all her days. Wouldn't it be nice? ” asked Jo, looking up with a brighter face.

“He is younger than she, you know, ” began Mrs. March, but Jo broke in—

“Only a little, he's old for his age, and tall, and can be quite grown-up in his manners if he likes. Then he's rich and generous and good, and loves us all, and I say it's a pity my plan is spoiled.”

“I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to depend on. Don't make plans, Jo, but let time and their own hearts mate your friends. We can't meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get ‘romantic rubbish', as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.”

“Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross and getting snarled up, when a pull here and a snip there would straighten it out. I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up. But buds will be roses, and kittens cats—more's the pity! ”

“What's that about flatirons and cats? ” asked Meg, as she crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand.

“Only one of my stupid speeches. I'm going to bed; come, Peggy, ”said Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.

“Quite right, and beautifully written. Please add that I send my love to John, ” said Mrs. March, as she glanced over the letter and gave it back.

“Do you call him ‘John'? ” asked Meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes looking down into her mother's.

“Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him, ”replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.

“I'm glad of that, he is so lonely. Good night, Mother, dear. It is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here, ” was Meg's answer.

The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and as she went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction and regret, “She does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.”





CHAPTER 21

LAURIE MAKES MISCHIEF, AND JO MAKES PEACE


JO'S FACE was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed upon her, and she found it hard not to look mysterious and important. Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask. She was rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother. This left Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse, and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long confinement. Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much as she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her.

She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led Jo a trying life of it. He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed, threatened, and scolded; affected indifference, that he might surprise the truth from her; declared he knew, then that he didn't care; and at last, by dint of perseverance, he satisfied himself that it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke. Feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.

Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was absorbed in preparations for her father's return, but all of a sudden a change seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two, she was quite unlike herself. She started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face. To her mother's inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and Jo's she silenced by begging to be let alone.

“She feels it in the air—love, I mean—and she's going very fast. She's got most of the symptoms—is twittery and cross, doesn't eat, lies awake, and mopes in corners. I caught her singing that song he gave her, and once she said ‘John', as you do, and then turned as red as a poppy. Whatever shall we do? ” said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however violent.

“Nothing but wait. Let her alone, be kind and patient, and Father's coming will settle everything, ” replied her mother.

“Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up. How odd! Teddy never seals mine, ” said Jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little post office.

Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face.

“My child, what is it? ” cried her mother, running to her, while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.

“It's all a mistake, he didn't send it. Oh, Jo, how could you do it? ” and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite broken.

“Me! I've done nothing! What's she talking about? ” cried Jo, bewildered.

Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled note from her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully, “You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you. How could you be so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both? ”

Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the note, which was written in a peculiar hand.





My Dearest Margaret,

I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate before I return. I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think they would consent if they knew that we adored one another. Mr. Laurence will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet girl, you will make me happy. I implore you to say nothing to your family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to.

Your devoted

JOHN





“Oh, the little villain! That's the way he meant to pay me for keeping my word to Mother. I'll give him a hearty scolding and bring him over to beg pardon, ” cried Jo, burning to execute immediate justice. But her mother held her back, saying, with a look she seldom wore—

“Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first. You have played so many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this.”

“On my word, Mother, I haven't! I never saw that note before, and don't know anything about it, as true as I live! ” said Jo, so earnestly that they believed her.“If I had taken part in it I'd have done it better than this, and have written a sensible note. I should think you'd have known Mr. Brooke wouldn't write such stuff as that, ” she added, scornfully tossing down the paper.

“It's like his writing, ” faltered Meg, comparing it with the note in her hand.

“Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it? ” cried Mrs. March quickly.

“Yes, I did! ” and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.

“Here's a scrape!Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured. I can't rest till I get hold of him.” And Jo made for the door again.

“Hush! Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought. Margaret, tell me the whole story, ” commanded Mrs. March, sitting down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.

“I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look as if he knew anything about it, ” began Meg, without looking up. “I was worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered how you liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I kept my little secret for a few days. I'm so silly that I liked to think no one knew, and while I was deciding what to say, I felt like the girls in books, who have such things to do. Forgive me, Mother, I'm paid for my silliness now. I never can look him in the face again.”

“What did you say to him? ” asked Mrs. March.

“I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet, that I didn't wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father. I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be his friend, but nothing more, for a long while.”

Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her hands, exclaiming, with a laugh, “You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence! Tell on, Meg. What did he say to that? ”

“He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he never sent any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my roguish sister, Jo, should take liberties with our names. It's very kind and respectful, but think how dreadful for me! ”

Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names. All of a sudden she stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking at them closely, said decidedly, “I don't believe Brooke ever saw either of these letters. Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours to crow over me with because I wouldn't tell him my secret.”

“Don't have any secrets, Jo. Tell it to Mother and keep out of trouble, as I should have done, ” said Meg warningly.

“Bless you, child! Mother told me.”

“That will do, Jo. I'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie. I shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at once.”

Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's real feelings. “Now, dear, what are your own? Do you love him enough to wait till he can make a home for you, or will you keep yourself quite free for the present? ”

“I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have anything to do with lovers for a long while, perhaps never, ” answered Meg petulantly. “If John doesn't know anything about this nonsense, don't tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their tongues. I won't be deceived and plagued and made a fool of. It's a shame! ”

Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her pride hurt by this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the future. The instant Laurie's step was heard in the hall, Meg fled into the study, and Mrs. March received the culprit alone. Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he wouldn't come, but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and stood twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once. Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like a sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt. The sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour, but what happened during that interview the girls never knew.

When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it wise to betray the fact. Meg received his humble apology, and was much comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke.

“I'll never tell him to my dying day—wild horses shan't drag it out of me; so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do anything to show how out-and-out sorry I am, ” he added, looking very much ashamed of himself.

“I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I didn't think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie, ” replied Meg, trying to hide her maidenly confusion under a gravely reproachful air.

“It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be spoken to for a month, but you will, though, won't you? ” And Laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture, as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior. Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.

Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart against him, and succeeding only in primming up her face into an expression of entire disapprobation. Laurie looked at her once or twice, but as she showed no sign of relenting, he felt injured, and turned his back on her till the others were done with him, when he made her a low bow and walked off without a word.

As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving, and when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt lonely and longed for Teddy. After resisting for some time, she yielded to the impulse, and armed with a book to return, went over to the big house.

“Is Mr. Laurence in? ” asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was coming downstairs.

“Yes, Miss, but I don't believe he's seeable just yet.”

“Why not? Is he ill? ”

“La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is in one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old gentleman, so I dursn't go nigh him.”

“Where is Laurie? ”

“Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been a-tapping. I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's ready, and there's no one to eat it.”

“I'll go and see what the matter is. I'm not afraid of either of them.”

Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's little study.

“Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you! ” called out the young gentleman in a threatening tone.

Jo immediately knocked again; the door flew open, and in she bounced before Laurie could recover from his surprise. Seeing that he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him, assumed a contrite expression, and going artistically down upon her knees, said meekly, “Please forgive me for being so cross. I came to make it up, and can't go away till I have.”

“It's all right. Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo, ” was the cavalier reply to her petition.

“Thank you, I will. Could I ask what's the matter? You don't look exactly easy in your mind.”

“I've been shaken, and I won't bear it! ” growled Laurie indignantly.

“Who did it? ” demanded Jo.

“Grandfather. If it had been anyone else I'd have—” And the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm.

“That's nothing. I often shake you, and you don't mind, ” said Jo soothingly.

“Pooh!You're a girl,and it's fun,but I'll allow no man to shake me! ”

“I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked as much like a thundercloud as you do now. Why were you treated so? ”

“Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for. I'd promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break my word.”

“Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way? ”

“No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could without bringing Meg in. As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me. Then I bolted, for fear I should forget myself.”

“It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know, so go down and make up. I'll help you.”

“Hanged if I do! I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone, just for a bit of a frolic. I was sorry about Meg, and begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again, when I wasn't in the wrong.”

“He didn't know that.”

“He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby. It's no use, Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of myself, and don't need anyone's apron string to hold on by.”

“What pepper pots you are! ” sighed Jo. “How do you mean to settle this affair? ”

“Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I can't tell him what the fuss's about.”

“Bless you! He won't do that.”

“I won't go down till he does.”

“Now, Teddy, be sensible. Let it pass, and I'll explain what I can. You can't stay here, so what's the use of being melodramatic? ”

“I don't intend to stay here long, anyway. I'll slip off and take a journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he'll come round fast enough.”

“I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him.”

“Don't preach. I'll go to Washington and see Brooke; it's gay there, and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles.”

“What fun you'd have! I wish I could run off too, ” said Jo, forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial life at the capital.

“Come on, then! Why not? You go and surprise your father, and I'll stir up old Brooke. It would be a glorious joke; let's do it, Jo. We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot off at once. I've got money enough; it will do you good, and no harm, as you go to your father.”

For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was, it just suited her. She was tired of care and confinement, longed for change, and thoughts of her father blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals, liberty and fun. Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.

“If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time; but as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home. Don't tempt me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan.”

“That's the fun of it, ” began Laurie, who had got a willful fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.

“Hold your tongue! ” cried Jo, covering her ears. “‘Prunes and prisms' are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to it. I came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of.”

“I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I thought you had more spirit, ” began Laurie insinuatingly.

“Bad boy, be quiet! Sit down and think of your own sins, don't go making me add to mine. If I get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away? ” asked Jo seriously.

“Yes, but you won't do it, ” answered Laurie, who wished to make up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be appeased first.

“If I can manage the young one, I can the old one, ” muttered Jo, as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map with his head propped up on both hands.

“Come in! ” And Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as Jo tapped at his door.

“It's only me, sir, come to return a book, ” she said blandly, as she entered.

“Want any more? ” asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but trying not to show it.

“Yes, please. I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the second volume, ” returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by accepting a second dose of Boswell's Johnson,as he had recommended that lively work.

The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps toward the shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed. Jo skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit. Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect that something was brewing in her mind, for after taking several brisk turns about the room, he faced round on her, speaking so abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor.

“What has that boy been about? Don't try to shield him. I know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home. I can't get a word from him, and when I threatened to shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself into his room.”

“He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to say a word to anyone, ” began Jo reluctantly.

“That won't do; he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls. If he's done anything amiss, he shall confess, beg pardon, and be punished. Out with it, Jo. I won't be kept in the dark.”

Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo would have gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft on the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she had to stay and brave it out.

“Indeed, sir, I cannot tell. Mother forbade it. Laurie has confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough. We don't keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you interfere. Please don't. It was partly my fault, but it's all right now. So let's forget it, and talk about the Rambler or something pleasant.”

“Hang the Rambler! Come down and give me your word that this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or impertinent. If he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll thrash him with my own hands.”

The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary. She obediently descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.

“Hum—ha—well, if the boy held his tongue because he promised, and not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him. He's a stubborn fellow and hard to manage, ” said Mr. Laurence, rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale, and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief.

“So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't, ” said Jo, trying to say a kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape only to fall into another.

“You think I'm not kind to him, hey? ” was the sharp answer.

“Oh, dear, no, sir. You are rather too kind sometimes, and then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience. Don't you think you are? ”

Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look quite placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech. To her great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, “You're right, girl, I am! I love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and I know how it will end, if we go on so.”

“I'll tell you, he'll run away.” Jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made; she meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear much restraint, and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.

Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down, with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which hung over his table.It was Laurie's father,who had run away in his youth,and married against the imperious old man's will. Jo fancied he remembered and regretted the past, and she wished she had held her tongue.

“He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only threatens it sometimes, when he gets tired of studying. I often think I should like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if you ever miss us, you may advertise for two boys and look among the ships bound for India.”

She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved, evidently taking the whole as a joke.

“You hussy, how dare you talk in that way? Where's your respect for me, and your proper bringing up? Bless the boys and girls! What torments they are, yet we can't do without them, ” he said, pinching her cheeks good-humoredly. “Go and bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it's all right, and advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather. I won't bear it.”

“He won't come, sir. He feels badly because you didn't believe him when he said he couldn't tell. I think the shaking hurt his feelings very much.”

Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr. Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.

“I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I suppose. What the dickens does the fellow expect? ” And the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.

“If I were you, I'd write him an apology, sir. He says he won't come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and goes on in an absurd way. A formal apology will make him see how foolish he is, and bring him down quite amiable. Try it. He likes fun, and this way is better than talking. I'll carry it up, and teach him his duty.”

Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying slowly, “You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being managed by you and Beth. Here, give me a bit of paper, and let us have done with this nonsense.”

The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult. Jo dropped a kiss on the top of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work, and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his most virtuous expression of countenance, “What a good fellow you are, Jo! Did you get blown up? ” he added, laughing.

“No, he was pretty mild, on the whole.”

“Ah! I got it all round. Even you cast me off over there, and I felt just ready to go to the deuce, ” he began apologetically.

“Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again, Teddy,my son.”

“I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I used to spoil my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there never will be an end, ”he said dolefully.

“Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it. Men always croak when they are hungry, ” and Jo whisked out at the front door after that.

“That's a ‘label' on my ‘sect', ” answered Laurie, quoting Amy, as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his grandfather, who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly respectful in manner all the rest of the day.

Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, Meg remembered. She never alluded to a certain person, but she thought of him a good deal, dreamed dreams more than ever, and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk for stamps, found a bit of paper scribbled over with the words, “Mrs. John Brooke, ” whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire, feeling that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day for her.





CHAPTER 22

PLEASANT MEADOWS


LIKE SUNSHINE AFTER a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand. Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for “the dear”, while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.

As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way. After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.

Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid Christmas Day. Hannah “felt in her bones” that it was going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's gift—a soft crimson merino wrapper—was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer:





THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH





God bless you, dear Queen Bess!

May nothing you dismay,

But health and peace and happiness

Be yours, this Christmas day.





Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,

And flowers for her nose;

Here's music for her pianee,

An Afghan for her toes,





A portrait of Joanna, see,

By Raphael No. 2,

Who laboured with great industry

To make it fair and true.





Accept a ribbon red, I beg,

For Madam Purrer's tail;

And ice cream made by lovely Peg, —

A Mont Blanc in a pail.





Their dearest love my makers laid

Within my breast of snow:

Accept it, and the Alpine maid,

From Laurie and from Jo.





How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo made as she presented them.

“I'm so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I couldn't hold one drop more, ” said Beth, quite sighing with contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the “Jungfrau” had sent her.

“So am I, ” added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed the long-desired Undine and Sintram.

“I'm sure I am, ” echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy of the Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a pretty frame.

“Of course I am! ” cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of her first silk dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it.

“How can I be otherwise? ” said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her breast.

Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is. Half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, “Here's another Christmas present for the March family.”

Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes,leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and couldn't. Of course there was a general stampede, and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things were done, and no one said a word. Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms. Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet. Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently explained. And Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in the most touching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, “Hush! Remember Beth.”

But it was too late; the study door flew open, the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold—joy put strength into the feeble limbs—and Beth ran straight into her father's arms. Never mind what happened just after that, for the full hearts overflowed, washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present.

It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen. As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and, seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.

Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you to imagine; also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked, rather abruptly, if he wouldn't like to have something to eat. Jo saw and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, “I hate estimable young men with brown eyes! ”

There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day.The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed,browned, and decorated; so was the plum pudding, which melted in one's mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said, “For my mind was that flustered, mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin' of it in a cloth.”

Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank healths, told stories, sang songs, “reminisced” as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.

“Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we expected to have. Do you remember? ” asked Jo, breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things.

“Rather a pleasant year on the whole! ” said Meg, smiling at the fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke with dignity.

“I think it's been a pretty hard one, ” observed Amy, watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.

“I'm glad it's over, because we've got you back, ” whispered Beth, who sat on her father's knee.

“Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially the latter part of it. But you have got on bravely, and I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon, ” said Mr. March, looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him.

“How do you know? Did Mother tell you? ” asked Jo.

“Not much. Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've made several discoveries today.”

“Oh, tell us what they are! ” cried Meg, who sat beside him.

“Here is one.” And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm. “I remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now—for in this seeming blemishes I read a little history. A burnt offering has been made of vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters, and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away.”

If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the approving smile he gave her.

“What about Jo? Please say something nice, for she has tried so hard and been so very, very good to me, ” said Beth in her father's ear.

He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an unusually mild expression in her face.

“In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the ‘son Jo' whom I left a year ago, ” said Mr. March. “I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower. She doesn't bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me. I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me.”

Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise, feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.

“Now, Beth, ” said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.

“There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be, ” began their father cheerfully;but recollecting how nearly he had lost her,he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own, “I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God.”

After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair—

“I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on every one with patience and good humor. I also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures. I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others.”

“What are you thinking of, Beth? ” asked Jo, when Amy had thanked her father and told about her ring.

“I read in Pilgrim's Progress today how, after many troubles, Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey's end, ” answered Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father's arms and went to the instrument, “It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I'll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the music for Father, because he likes the verses.”

So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song for her:





He that is down need fear no fall,

He that is low no pride;

He that is humble ever shall

Have God to be his guide.

I am content with what I have,

Little be it, or much;

And, Lord! Contentment still I crave,

Because Thou savest such.

Fulness to them a burden is,

That go on pilgrimage;

Here little, and hereafter bliss,

Is best from age to age!





CHAPTER 23

AUNT MARCH SETTLES THE QUESTION


LIKE BEES SWARMING after their queen, mother and daughters hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then “to peek at the dear man, ” nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been left in the hall; Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was mentioned; Amy said, “Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home, ” and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as usual.

Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.

“What does the goose mean? ” said Meg, laughing and trying to look unconscious.

“He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn't it? ” answered Jo scornfully.

“Don't say my John,it isn't proper or true, ”but Meg's voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. “Please don't plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and there isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before.”

“We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief has spoiled you for me. I see it, and so does Mother; you are not like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all settled. I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly, ” said Jo pettishly.

“I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because Father said I was too young, ” began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point.

“If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would cry or blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a good, decided, No.”

“I'm not so silly and weak as you think. I know just what I should say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken unawares; there's no knowing what may happen, and I wished to be prepared.”

Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks.

“Would you mind telling me what you'd say? ” asked Jo more respectfully.

“Not at all. You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be my confident, and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by, perhaps, in your own affairs of this sort.”

“Don't mean to have any. It's fun to watch other people philander, but I should feel like a fool doing it myself, ” said Jo, looking alarmed at the thought.

“I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you.” Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.

“I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man, ” said Jo, rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.

“Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, ‘Thank you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that I am too young to enter into any engagement at present; so please say no more, but let us be friends as we were.'”

“Hum, that's stiff and cool enough! I don't believe you'll ever say it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his feelings.”

“No, I won't. I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and shall walk out of the room with dignity.”

Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time. Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.

“Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your father finds himself today, ” said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.

“It's very well, he's in the rack. I'll get him, and tell it you are here.”And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity. But the instant she vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring—

“Mother will like to see you. Pray sit down, I'll call her.”

“Don't go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret? ” and Mr. Brooke looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said gratefully—

“How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father? I only wish I could thank you for it.”

“Shall I tell you how? ” asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen.

“Oh no, please don't—I'd rather not, ” she said, trying to withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.

“I won't trouble you. I only want to know if you care for me a little, Meg. I love you so much, dear, ” added Mr. Brooke tenderly.

This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make it; she forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, “I don't know, ” so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply.

He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in his most persuasive tone, “Will you try and find out? I want to know so much, for I can't go to work with any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end or not.”

“I'm too young, ” faltered Meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.

“I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to like me. Would it be a very hard lesson, dear? ”

“Not if I chose to learn it, but—”

“Please choose to learn, Meg. I love to teach, and this is easier than German, ” broke in John, getting possession of the other hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it.

His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. This nettled her. Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, “I don't choose. Please go away and let me be! ”

Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such a mood before, and it rather bewildered him.

“Do you really mean that? ” he asked anxiously, following her as she walked away.

“Yes, I do. I don't want to be worried about such things. Father says I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not.”

“Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by? I'll wait and say nothing till you have had more time. Don't play with me, Meg. I didn't think that of you.”

“Don't think of me at all. I'd rather you wouldn't, ” said Meg, taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience and her own power.

He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did. He just stood looking at her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself. What would have happened next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute.

The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew, for she had met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of Mr. March's arrival, drove straight out to see him. The family were all busy in the back part of the house, and she had made her way quietly in, hoping to surprise them. She did surprise two of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.

“Bless me, what's all this? ” cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady.

“It's Father's friend. I'm so surprised to see you! ” stammered Meg, feeling that she was in for a lecture now.

“That's evident, ” returned Aunt March, sitting down. “But what is Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony? There's mischief going on, and I insist upon knowing what it is, ” with another rap.

“We were only talking. Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella, ” began Meg, wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house.

“Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I understand now. I know all about it. Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father's letters, and I made her tell me. You haven't gone and accepted him, child? ” cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.

“Hush! He'll hear. Shan't I call Mother? ” said Meg, much troubled.

“Not yet. I've something to say to you, and I must free my mind at once. Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook? If you do, not one penny of my money ever goes to you. Remember that, and be a sensible girl, ” said the old lady impressively.

Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. The best of us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would probably have declared she couldn't think of it, but as she was peremptorily ordered not to like him,she immediately made up her mind that she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit.

“I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can leave your money to anyone you like, ” she said, nodding her head with a resolute air.

“Highty-tighty! Is that the way you take my advice, Miss? You'll be sorry for it by-and-by, when you've tried love in a cottage and found it a failure.”

“It can't be a worse one than some people find in big houses, ” retorted Meg.

Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl, for she did not know her in this new mood. Meg hardly knew herself, she felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend John and assert her right to love him, if she liked. Aunt March saw that she had begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she could, “Now, Meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice. I mean it kindly, and don't want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning. You ought to marry well and help your family. It's your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you.”

“Father and Mother don't think so.They like John though he is poor.”

“Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of babies.”

“I'm glad of it, ” cried Meg stoutly.

Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture. “This Rook is poor and hasn't got any rich relations, has he? ”

“No, but he has many warm friends.”

“You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll grow. He hasn't any business, has he? ”

“Not yet. Mr. Laurence is going to help him.”

“That won't last long. James Laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on. So you intend to marry a man without money, position, or business, and go on working harder than you do now, when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better? I thought you had more sense, Meg.”

“I couldn't do better if I waited half my life! John is good and wise, he's got heaps of talent, he's willing to work and sure to get on, he's so energetic and brave. Everyone likes and respects him, and I'm proud to think he cares for me, though I'm so poor and young and silly, ” said Meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness.

“He knows you have got rich relations,child.That's the secret of his liking, I suspect.”

“Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing? John is above such meanness, and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so, ” cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of the old lady's suspicions. “My John wouldn't marry for money, any more than I would. We are willing to work and we mean to wait. I'm not afraid of being poor, for I've been happy so far, and I know I shall be with him because he loves me, and I—”

Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't made up her mind, that she had told “her John” to go away, and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.

Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.

“Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair! You are a willful child, and you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly. No, I won't stop. I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits to see your father now. Don't expect anything from me when you are married. Your Mr. Brooke's friends must take care of you. I'm done with you forever.”

And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in high dudgeon. She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her, for when left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to laugh or cry. Before she could make up her mind, she was taken possession of by Mr. Brooke, who said all in one breath, “I couldn't help hearing, Meg. Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March for proving that you do care for me a little bit.”

“I didn't know how much till she abused you, ” began Meg.

“And I needn't go away, but may stay and be happy, may I, dear? ”

Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either, and disgraced herself forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering, “Yes, John, ” and hiding her face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.

Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to herself,“She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is settled. I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over it.”

But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes. Going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission. Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away. At the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her. Meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but“that man”, as Jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, “Sister Jo, congratulate us! ”

That was adding insult to injury—it was altogether too much—and making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished without a word. Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room,“Oh,do somebody go down quick!John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes it! ”

Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself upon the bed, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to Beth and Amy. The little girls, however, considered it a most agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from them, so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her troubles to the rats.

Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but a great deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit, told his plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it.

The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper, both looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal. Amy was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity, Beth beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident Aunt March was right in calling them as “unworldly as a pair of babies.” No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there.

“You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg? ”said Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she was planning to make.

“No, I'm sure I can't. How much has happened since I said that! It seems a year ago, ” answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.

“The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather think the changes have begun, ” said Mrs. March. “In most families there comes, now and then, a year full of events. This has been such a one, but it ends well, after all.”

“Hope the next will end better, ” muttered Jo, who found it very hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way.

“I hope the third year from this will end better.I mean it shall,if I live to work out my plans, ” said Mr. Brooke, smiling at Meg, as if everything had become possible to him now.

“Doesn't it seem very long to wait? ” asked Amy, who was in a hurry for the wedding.

“I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems a short time to me, ” answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before.

“You have only to wait, I am to do the work, ” said John beginning his labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged, “Here comes Laurie. Now we shall have some sensible conversation.”

But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing with good spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for “Mrs. John Brooke”, and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management.

“I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does, for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done though the sky falls, ” said Laurie, when he had presented his offering and his congratulations.

“Much obliged for that recommendation. I take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot, ” answered Mr. Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil.

“I'll come if I'm at the ends of the earth, for the sight of Jo's face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey. You don't look festive, ma'am, what's the matter? ” asked Laurie, following her into a corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned to greet Mr. Laurence.

“I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear it, and shall not say a word against it, ” said Jo solemnly. “You can't know how hard it is for me to give up Meg, ” she continued with a little quiver in her voice.

“You don't give her up. You only go halves, ” said Laurie consolingly.

“It can never be the same again. I've lost my dearest friend, ” sighed Jo.

“You've got me, anyhow. I'm not good for much, I know, but I'll stand by you, Jo, all the days of my life. Upon my word I will! ” and Laurie meant what he said.

“I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged. You are always a great comfort to me, Teddy, ” returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.

“Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow. It's all right you see. Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled immediately, Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly to see Meg in her own little house. We'll have capital times after she is gone, for I shall be through college before long, and then we'll go abroad on some nice trip or other. Wouldn't that console you? ”

“I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen in three years, ” said Jo thoughtfully.

“That's true. Don't you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then? I do, ” returned Laurie.

“I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks so happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved.” And Jo's eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the prospect was a pleasant one.

Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago. Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own, the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy. Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily with her old friend, who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked. Jo lounged in her favorite low seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and Laurie, leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both.

So grouped, the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women.





PART TWO





CHAPTER 24

GOSSIP


IN ORDER THAT we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches. And here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much“lovering” in the story, as I fear they may (I'm not afraid the young folks will make that objection), I can only say with Mrs. March,“What can you expect when I have four gay girls in the house, and a dashing young neighbor over the way? ”

The three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family. The war is over, and Mr. March safely at home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls all mankind “brother”, the piety that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely.

These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to him many admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees, and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop. Earnest young men found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they, thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure of finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel;sinners told their sins to the pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and saved; gifted men found a companion in him; ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own, and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true, although “they wouldn't pay.”

To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house, and so they did in many things; but the quiet scholar, sitting among his books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience, anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always turned in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those sacred words, husband and father.

The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their souls into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and labored so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death.

Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded “boys” and soldiers' widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.

John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was sent home, and not allowed to return. He received no stars or bars, but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom. Perfectly resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well, preparing for business, and earning a home for Meg. With the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him, he refused Mr. Laurence's more generous offers, and accepted the place of bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money.

Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing womanly in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than ever, for love is a great beautifier. She had her girlish ambitions and hopes, and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin. Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner, and Meg couldn't help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. But somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had put into the little home awaiting her, and when they sat together in the twilight, talking over their small plans, the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie's splendor and felt herself the richest, happiest girl in Christendom.

Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such a fancy to Amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going; and for the sake of this advantage, Amy would have served a far harder mistress. So she gave her mornings to duty, her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely. Jo meantime devoted herself to literature and Beth, who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past. Not an invalid exactly, but never again the rosy, healthy creature she had been, yet always hopeful, happy, and serene, and busy with the quiet duties she loved, everyone's friend, and an angel in the house,long before those who loved her most had learned to know it.

As long as The Spread Eagle paid her a dollar a column for her“rubbish”, as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and spun her little romances diligently. But great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame.

Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather, was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself. A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners, much talent, and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them, he stood in great danger of being spoiled, and probably would have been, like many another promising boy, if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success, the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son, and last, but not least by any means, the knowledge that four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him with all their hearts.

Being only “a glorious human boy”, of course he frolicked and flirted, grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as college fashions ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion. But as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. In fact, he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified professors, and vanquished enemies. The “men of my class, ” were heroes in the eyes of the girls, who never wearied of the exploits of “our fellows”, and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures, when Laurie brought them home with him.

Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed. Meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular John to care for any other lords of creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own element, and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies. They all liked Jo immensely, but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine. And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the “Dovecote”.

That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for Meg's first home. Laurie had christened it, saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who “went on together like a pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo.” It was a tiny house, with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front. Here Meg meant to have a fountain, shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches, undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted. But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar. To be sure, the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit, and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin. But once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete, for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory. There were no marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought.

I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its beauty because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than Amy's artistic hand, or that any storeroom was ever better provided with good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg's few boxes, barrels, and bundles, and I am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if Hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over, and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute “Mis. Brooke came home.” I also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round, and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.

People who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them, and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest, from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was eloquent of home love and tender forethought.

What happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains. In his love of jokes, this young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as ever. His last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. Now a bag of remarkable clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives, or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt, labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands, infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.

In vain Meg begged him to stop. John laughed at him, and Jo called him “Mr. Toodles”. He was possessed with a mania for patronizing Yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.

Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's setting the table for the first meal.

“Are you satisfied? Does it seem like home, and do you feel as if you should be happy here? ” asked Mrs. March, as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.

“Yes,Mother,perfectly satisfied,thanks to you all,and so happy that I can't talk about it, ” answered Meg, with a look that was far better than words.

“If she only had a servant or two it would be all right, ” said Amy,coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.

“Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my mind to try her way first. There will be so little to do that with Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick, ” answered Meg tranquilly.

“Sallie Moffat has four, ” began Amy.

“If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis would have to camp in the garden, ” broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.

“Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment. Meg and John begin humbly, but I have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one. It's a great mistake for young girls like Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. When I was first married, I used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn, so that I might have the pleasure of mending them, for I got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief.”

“Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie says she does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her, ” said Meg.

“I did after a while, not to ‘mess' but to learn of Hannah how things should be done,that my servants need not laugh at me.It was play then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford to hire help. You begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer man, for the mistress of a house, however splendid, should know how work ought to be done, if she wishes to be well and honestly served.”

“Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that, ” said Meg, listening respectfully to the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping. “Do you know I like this room most of all in my baby house, ” added Meg, a minute after, as they went upstairs and she looked into her well-stored linen closet.

Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array. All three laughed as Meg spoke, for that linen closet was a joke. You see, having said that if Meg married “that Brooke” she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt March was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow. She never broke her word, and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself. Mrs. Carrol, Florence's mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen,and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for Aunt March tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride.

“That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see. I had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her, ” said Mrs. March, patting the damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness.

“I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will last me all my days, Hannah says.” And Meg looked quite contented, as well she might.

“Toodles is coming, ” cried Jo from below, and they all went down to meet Laurie, whose weekly visit was an important event in their quiet lives.

A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a felt basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the road at a great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and a hearty—

“Here I am, Mother! Yes, it's all right.”

The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss.

“For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and compliments. Bless you, Beth! What a refreshing spectacle you are, Jo. Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady.”

As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown-paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and everyone began to talk.

“Where is John? ” asked Meg anxiously.

“Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am.”

“Which side won the last match, Teddy? ” inquired Jo, who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.

“Ours, of course. Wish you'd been there to see.”

“How is the lovely Miss Randal? ” asked Amy with a significant smile.

“More cruel than ever. Don't you see how I'm pining away? ” and Laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh.

“What's the last joke? Undo the bundle and see, Meg, ” said Beth, eying the knobby parcel with curiosity.

“It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves, ”observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared, amid the laughter of the girls.

“Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs. Meg, just swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy. Nice thing, isn't it? ” And Laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.

“There's gratitude for you! And speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction. I saw it going into your house as I came by, and if she hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it looked like a remarkably plummy one.”

“I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie, ” said Meg in a matronly tone.

“I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid, as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days, ” responded the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the little chandelier.

“I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick-and-span bower, so as I'm tremendously hungry, I propose an adjournment, ” he added presently.

“Mother and I are going to wait for John. There are some last things to settle, ” said Meg, bustling away.

“Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers for tomorrow, ” added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.

“Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow. I'm in such a state of exhaustion I can't get home without help. Don't take off your apron, whatever you do;it's peculiarly becoming, ” said Laurie, as Jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps.

“Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow, ” began Jo,as they strolled away together.“You must promise to behave well,and not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans.”

“Not a prank.”

“And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober.”

“I never do. You are the one for that.”

“And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony. I shall certainly laugh if you do.”

“You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect.”

“I never cry unless for some great affliction.”

“Such as fellows going to college, hey? ” cut in Laurie, with suggestive laugh.

“Don't be a peacock. I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company.”

“Exactly. I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week? Pretty amiable? ”

“Very. Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how he'll take it? ” asked Jo rather sharply.

“Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say ‘All right, ' if it wasn't? ” and Laurie stopped short, with an injured air.

“No, I don't.”

“Then don't go and be suspicious. I only want some money, ” said Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.

“You spend a great deal, Teddy.”

“Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone before I know it.”

“You are so generous and kindhearted that you let people borrow, and can't say ‘No' to anyone. We heard about Henshaw and all you did for him. If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame you, ” said Jo warmly.

“Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill. You wouldn't have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you? ”

“Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home. I thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be hideous—to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. If it was cheap ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I don't get any satisfaction out of it.”

Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this attack, that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the maltreated hat, and stuffed it into his pocket.

“Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul! I have enough all through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home. I'll get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends.”

“I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow. I'm not aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter, ” observed Jo severely.

“This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it, ”returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for quarter-of-an-inch-long stubble.

“By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting desperate about Amy. He talks of her constantly, writes poetry, and moons about in a most suspicious manner. He'd better nip his little passion in the bud, hadn't he? ” added Laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone, after a minute's silence.

“Of course he had. We don't want any more marrying in this family for years to come.Mercy on us,what are the children thinking of? ”And Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little Parker were not yet in their teens.

“It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am. You are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left lamenting, ” said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times.

“Don't be alarmed. I'm not one of the agreeable sort. Nobody will want me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old maid in a family.”

“You won't give anyone a chance, ” said Laurie, with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. “You won't show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and can't help showing that he likes it, you treat him as Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart—throw cold water over him—and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you.”

“I don't like that sort of thing. I'm too busy to be worried with nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so. Now don't say any more about it. Meg's wedding has turned all our heads, and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I don't wish to get cross, so let's change the subject.” And Jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation.

Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate,“Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next.”





CHAPTER 25

THE FIRST WEDDING


THE JUNE ROSES over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, as they were. Quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long.

Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have. “I don't want a fashionable wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self.”

So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart. Her sisters braided up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley,which “her John” liked best of all the flowers that grew.

“You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress, ” cried Amy, surveying her with delight when all was done.

“Then I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don't mind my dress. I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today.”and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not changed the old.

“Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few minutes with Father quietly in the study.” And Meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest.

As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their best just now.

Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with ease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.

Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever; the beautiful, kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one, although it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of “being better soon.”

Amy is with truth considered “the flower of the family”, for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman—not beautiful, but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her dress, the droop of her hair—unconscious yet harmonious, and as attractive to many as beauty itself.Amy's nose still afflicted her, for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and having a decided chin. These offending features gave character to her whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than ever.

All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom; and all three looked just what they were—fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood.

There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in, to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.

“Upon my word, here's a state of things! ” cried the old lady, taking the seat of honor prepared for her,and settling the folds of her lavender moiré with a great rustle. “You oughtn't to be seen till the last minute, child.”

“I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon. I'm too happy to care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little wedding just as I like it. John, dear, here's your hammer.” And away went Meg to help “that man” in his highly improper employment.

Mr. Brooke didn't even say, “Thank you, ” but as he stooped for the unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door, with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.

A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous exclamation, “Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset the cake again! ”caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived, and the party came in, as Beth used to say when a child.

“Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than mosquitoes, ” whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and Laurie's black head towered above the rest.

“He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes, ” returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.

There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green arch. Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up;the fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn; the bridegroom's hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies; but Meg looked straight up in her husband's eyes, and said, “I will! ” with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly.

Jo did not cry,though she was very near it once,and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes. Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.

It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly married, Meg cried, “The first kiss for Marmee! ” and turning, gave it with her heart on her lips. During the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, “Bless you, deary, a hundred times! The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely.”

Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light. There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried round. No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.

“Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident? ” he whispered, “or am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this morning? ”

“No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home. You know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof.”

Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous way,“I like that! For I've seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do.”

“You are not made wise by experience, I hope? ” And there was an anxious accent in Meg's voice.

“No. I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me, either, this is not one of my temptations. Being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see.”

“But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life.”

A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak, but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness, and a smile which said, “No one can refuse me anything today.” Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her his hand, saying heartily, “I promise, Mrs. Brooke! ”

“I thank you, very, very much.”

“And I drink ‘long life to your resolution, ' Teddy, ” cried Jo, baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him.

So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his life.

After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within. Meg and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot, when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding.

“All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside! ” cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into the ring. But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady, she just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.

Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people began to go.

“I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well; but I think you'll be sorry for it, ” said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as he led her to the carriage, “You've got a treasure, young man, see that you deserve it.”

“That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it, ” observed Mrs. Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.

“Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly satisfied, ” said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning.

“I'll do my best to gratify you, sir, ” was Laurie's unusually dutiful reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.

The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say good-by, as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.

“Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love you any the less for loving John so much, ” she said, clinging to her mother, with full eyes for a moment. “I shall come every day, Father, and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts,though I am married.Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank you all for my happy wedding day. Good-by, good-by! ”

They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with her hands full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy face—and so Meg's married life began.





CHAPTER 26

ARTISTIC ATTEMPTS


IT TAKES PEOPLE a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius, especially ambitious young men and women. Amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity. For a long time there was a lull in the “mud-pie” business, and she devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable. But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching.

While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire. Raphael's face was found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on the head of a beer barrel; a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied kindling for some time.

From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer, if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio, suggested Murillo; oily-brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants, Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a king's robe, as the spectator pleased.

Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row, looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good, and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were pronounced“wonderfully fine”. A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off closet shelves onto people's heads. Children were enticed in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which quenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity. With much difficulty and some danger she was dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt, at least.

After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to book “a delicious bit”, composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or “a heavenly mass of clouds”, that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. She sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after “points of sight, ” or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called.

If “genius is eternal patience, ” as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called “high art”.

She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she never became a great artist. Here she succeeded better, for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends everywhere,and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star. Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. She had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, “If Amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do.”

One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in “our best society”, without being quite sure what the best really was. Money, position, fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not admirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now excluded her.

“My lady, ” as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.

“I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma, ” Amy said, coming in with an important air one day.

“Well, little girl, what is it? ” replied her mother, in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained “the baby”.

“Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. They are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things they admire in my book. They have been very kind to me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know I am poor, yet they never made any difference.”

“Why should they? ” And Mrs. March put the question with what the girls called her “Maria Theresa air”.

“You know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when your chickens get pecked by smarter birds; the ugly duckling turned out a swan, you know.” and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit.

Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked, “Well, my swan, what is your plan? ”

“I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river, perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them.”

“That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose? ”

“Oh, dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate and ice cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant,though I do work for my living.”

“How many young ladies are there? ” asked her mother, beginning to look sober.

“Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come.”

“Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them about.”

“Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing? Not more than six or eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounce.” (Hannah's pronunciation of charàbanc.)

“All of this will be expensive, Amy.”

“Not very. I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself.”

“Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things, and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances? ”

“If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it, ” said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into obstinacy.

Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna.

“Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll say no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you decide, I'll do my best to help you.”

“Thanks,Mother,you are always so kind.”And away went Amy to lay her plan before her sisters.

Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons. But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first.

“Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a coupé, ” said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.

“I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do! ”returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions arose. “The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense. You don't care to make people like you, to go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I mean to make the most of every chance that comes.Yo u can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it independence, if you like. That's not my way.”

When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side, while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument. Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more amiable turn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she regarded as “a nonsensical business”.

The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following Monday was set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that “ef the washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well anywheres.” This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern,but Amy's motto was“Nil desperandum”,and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles. To begin with, Hannah's cooking didn't turn out well. The chicken was tough,the tongue too salty, and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly. Then the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward. Beth got a cold and took to her bed. Meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.

“If it hadn't been for Mother I never should have got through, ” as Amy declared afterward, and gratefully remembered when “the best joke of the season” was entirely forgotten by everybody else.

If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday—an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a little, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got in order. The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.

The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver would get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights, for the“cherry bounce” and the broken bridge were her strong points.

Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came; and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.

“No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must fly round and be ready for them, ” said Amy, as the sun woke her next morning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting a little stale.

“I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today, ”said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of placid despair.

“Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad, ” advised his wife.

“Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at it. I'm very sorry, Amy, ” added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.

“Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do, ”said Amy decidedly.

“Shall I rush into town and demand one? ” asked Jo, with the magnanimity of a martyr.

“You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to try me. I'll go myself, ” answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to fail.

Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her own forethought.

As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to find out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said, “Good morning, Miss March, ” and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's most elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress, returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.

They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and—oh horror! —the lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a Tudor!

“By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner! ” cried the unconscious youth, poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady.

“Please don't—it's—it's mine, ” murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red as her fish.

“Oh, really, I beg pardon. It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it? ” said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding.

Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat, and said, laughing, “Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat it? ”

Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind were touched: the lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about “the charming young ladies” diverted his mind from the comical mishap.

“I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't see them, that's a comfort, ” thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.

She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve o'clock all was ready again. Feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the “cherry bounce”, and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.

“There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go onto the porch and meet them. It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble, ” said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word. But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression, for, looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.

“Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl, ” cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even for a laugh.

In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise. The rest of the family, being of a dramatic turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the merriment which possessed them. The remodeled lunch being gaily partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce), and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when “the party went out.”

As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared, except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.

“You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear, ” said her mother, as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.

“Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I thought, ” observed Beth, with unusual warmth.

“Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours, ” asked Meg soberly.

“Take it all. I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will mold before I can dispose of it, ” answered Amy, thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.

“It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us, ” began Jo, as they sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.

A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed, “Salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn”—here a general explosion of laughter cut short the “history of salads”, to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.

“Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels. Germans like messes. I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no reason you should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool, ” cried Amy, wiping her eyes.

“I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng, ” sighed Jo, quite spent with laughter.

“I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to satisfy you, ” said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.

“I am satisfied;I've done what I undertook,and it's not my fault that it failed. I comfort myself with that, ” said Amy with a little quiver in her voice. “I thank you all very much for helping me, and I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at least.”

No one did for several months, but the word ‘fete' always produced a general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.





CHAPTER 27

LITERARY LESSONS


FORTUNE SUDDENLY SMILED upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her path. Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her in this wise.

Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her scribbling suit, and “fall into a vortex, ” as she expressed it, writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was finished she could find no peace. Her “scribbling suit” consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. This cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, “Does genius burn, Jo? ” They did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that hard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and cast upon the floor. At such times the intruder silently withdrew, and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow, did anyone dare address Jo.

She did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh. Sleep forsook her eyes, meals stood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth living, even if they bore no other fruit. The devine afflatus usually lasted a week or two, and then she emerged from her “vortex”, hungry, sleepy, cross, or despondent.

She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea. It was a People's Course, the lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.

They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking, Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the seat with them. On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads and bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights and making tatting. Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna. On her right, her only neighbor was a studious looking-lad absorbed in a newspaper.

It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her, idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume, tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open. Pausing to turn a page, the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half his paper, saying bluntly, “Want to read it? That's a first-rate story.”

Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love, mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.

“Prime, isn't it? ” asked the boy, as her eye went down the last paragraph of her portion.

“I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried, ” returned Jo, amused at his admiration of the trash.

“I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good living out of such stories, they say.” And he pointed to the name of Mrs. S.L.A.N.G. Northbury, under the title of the tale.

“Do you know her? ” asked Jo, with sudden interest.

“No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is printed.”

“Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this? ” and Jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page.

“Guess she does! She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well for writing it.”

Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper, and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its columns for a sensational story. By the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not the first founded on paper), and was already deep in the concoction of her story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder.

She said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when“genius took to burning.” Jo had never tried this style before, contenting herself with very mild romances for The Spread Eagle.Her experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and costumes. Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement. The manuscript was privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect, she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.

Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap. For a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry. If the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature, I think he would devote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo valued the letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.

A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won the prize. Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story came everyone read and praised it, though after her father had told her that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly way—

“You can do better than this, Jo. Aim at the highest, and never mind the money.”

“I think the money is the best part of it.What will you do with such a fortune? ” asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a reverential eye.

“Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two, ” answered Jo promptly.

“Oh, how splendid! No, I can't do it, dear, it would be so selfish, ”cried Beth, who had clapped her thin hands and taken a long breath, as if pining for fresh ocean breeze, then stooped herself and motioned away the check which her sister waved before her.

“Ah, but you shall go, I've set my heart on it. That's what I tried for, and that's why I succeeded. I never get on when I think see? Besides, Marmee needs the change , and she won't leave you, so you must go. Won't it be fun to see you come home plump and rosy again? Hurrah for Dr. Jo, who always cures her patients! ”

To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn't come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better, while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger; so Jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the house, for by the magic of a pen,her“rubbish”turned into comforts for them all.The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill,A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.

Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the world. Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.

Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and fortune. Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she particularly admired.

“Now I must either bundle it back into my tin kitchen to mold, pay for printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can for it. Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject, ” said Jo, calling a family council.

“Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know, and the idea is well worked out. Let it wait and ripen, ” was her father's advice; and he practiced what he preached, having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.

“It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by waiting, ” said Mrs. March. “Criticism is the best test of such work, for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her to do better next time. We are too partial, but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.”

“Yes, ” said Jo, knitting her brows, “that's just it. I've been fussing over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or indifferent. It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.”

“I wouldn't leave a word out of it; you'll spoil it if you do, for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on, ” said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written.

“But Mr. Allen says, ‘Leave out the explanations, make it brief and dramatic, and let the characters tell the story, '” interrupted Jo, turning to the publisher's note.

“Do as he tells you. He knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a good, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when you've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels, ” said Amy, who took a strictly practical view of the subject.

“Well, ”said Jo, laughing,“if my people are‘philosophical and metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things, except what I hear father say, sometimes. If I've got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me. Now, Beth, what do you say? ”

“I should so like to see it printed soon, ”was all Beth said,and smiled in saying it; but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a forboding fear, and decided her to make her little venture “soon”.

So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre. In the hope of pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody.

Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about it. Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description; out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story. Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the story. Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into the big, busy world to try its fate.

Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it; likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover.

“You said, Mother, that criticism would help me. But how can it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments? ” cried poor Jo, turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next. “This man says, ‘An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and healthy.'”continued the perplexed authoress. “The next, ‘The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.' Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism, and copied my characters from life, I don't see how this critic can be right. Another says, ‘It's one of the best American novels which has appeared for years' (I know better than that); and the next asserts that ‘Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't! Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money. I wish I'd printed the whole or not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.”

Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally. Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so well and had apparently done so ill. But it did her good, for those whose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an author's best education; and when the first soreness was over, she could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.

“Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me, ” she said stoutly, “and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd, and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced ‘charmingly natural, tender, and true.' So I'll comfort myself with that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take another.”





CHAPTER 28

DOMESTIC EXPERIENCES


LIKE MOST other young matrons, Meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper. John should find home a paradise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously every day, and never know the loss of a button. She brought so much love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed, in spite of some obstacles. Her paradise was not a tranquil one, for the little woman fussed, was overanxious to please, and bustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares. She was too tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare. As for buttons, she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better than hers.

They were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't live on love alone. John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffeepot. Nor did Meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, “Shall I send some veal or mutton for dinner, darling? ” The little house ceased to be a glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better. At first they played keephouse, and frolicked over it like children; then John took steadily to business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders; and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.

While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the problems with patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little Hummels. An evening with John over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. Before the golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without—a family jar.

Fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once. As John firmly believed that “my wife” was equal to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use. Home came four dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for her. With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her success, for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times? The array of pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling, straining, and fussing over her jelly. She did her best, she asked advice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but that dreadful stuff wouldn't jell.

She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand, but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with their private worries, experiments, or quarrels. They had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one; but they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on without help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had advised the plan. So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her topsy-turvy kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept.

Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, “My husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he likes. I shall always be prepared. There shall be no flurry, no scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good dinner. John,dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you please, and be sure of a welcome from me.”

How charming that was, to be sure! John quite glowed with pride to hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior wife. But, although they had had company from time to time, it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now. It always happens so in this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.

If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. Congratulating himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty wife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband.

It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached the Dovecote. The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned the steps. The parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest. Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a sanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.

“I'm afraid something has happened. Step into the garden—Scott, while I look up Mrs. Brooke, ” said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.

Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face. He paused discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he could both see and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.

In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair; one edition of jelly was trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was burning gaily on the stove. Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat sobbing dismally.

“My dearest girl, what is the matter? ” cried John, rushing in, with awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.

“Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried! I've been at it till I'm all worn out.Do come and help me or I shall die! ”And the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor.

“What worries you dear? Has anything dreadful happened? ” asked the anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was all askew.

“Yes, ” sobbed Meg despairingly.

“Tell me quick, then. Don't cry. I can bear anything better than that. Out with it, love.”

“The— the jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do! ”

John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.

“Is that all? Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any more about it. I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's sake don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner, and—”

John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay—

“A man to dinner, and everything in a mess! John Brooke, how could you do such a thing? ”

“Hush, he's in the garden! I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can't be helped now, ” said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.

“You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to have remembered how busy I was, ” continued Meg petulantly, for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled.

“I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for I met him on the way out. I never thought of asking leave, when you have always told me to do as I liked. I never tried it before, and hang me if I ever do again! ” added John, with an aggrieved air.

“I should hope not! Take him away at once. I can't see him, and there isn't any dinner.”

“Well, I like that! Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and the pudding you promised? ” cried John, rushing to the larder.

“I hadn't time to cook anything. I meant to dine at Mother's. I'm sorry, but I was so busy, ”and Meg's tears began again.

John was a mild man, but he was human; and after a long day's work to come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty table, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or manner. He restrained himself, however, and the little squall would have blown over, but for one unlucky word.

“It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull through and have a good time yet. Don't cry, dear, but just exert yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat. We're both as hungry as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is. Give us the cold meat, and bread and cheese; we won't ask for jelly.”

He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his fate.Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure,and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.

“You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can. I'm too used up to ‘exert' myself for anyone. It's like a man to propose a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company. I won't have anything of the sort in my house. Take that Scott up to Mother's, and tell him I'm away, sick, dead—anything. I won't see him, and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like. You won't have anything else here.” And having delivered her defiance all on one breath, Meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room.

What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew; but Mr. Scott was not taken “up to Mother's, ” and when Meg descended, after they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror. Lotty reported that they had eaten “a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff, and hide the pots.”

Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own shortcomings, of loyalty to John, “who might be cruel, but nobody should know it, ” restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up, she dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be forgiven.

Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light. He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had deserted him in his hour of need. “It wasn't fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied. No, by George, it wasn't! And Meg must know it.” He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over him. “Poor little thing! It was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me. She was wrong, of course, but then she was young. I must be patient and teach her.” He hoped she had not gone home—he hated gossip and interference. For a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it; and then the fear that Meg would cry herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace, resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse.

Meg likewise resolved to be“calm and kind,but firm, ”and show him his duty. She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally, as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.

John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly relevant remark, “We are going to have a new moon, my dear.”

“I've no objection” was Meg's equally soothing remark.

A few other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished. John went to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it, figuratively speaking. Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither spoke; both looked quite “calm and firm, ” and both felt desperately uncomfortable.

“Oh, dear, ” thought Meg, “married life is very trying, and does need infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.” The word “Mother”suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with unbelieving protests.

“John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see and bear with them, remembering your own. He is very decided, but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. He is very accurate, and particular about the truth—a good trait, though you call him‘fussy'. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg, and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need. He has a temper, not like ours—one flash and then all over—but the white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to quench. Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against yourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect. Watch yourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against the little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret.”

These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset, especially the last. This was the first serious disagreement; her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart. She glanced at him with tears in her eyes, but he did not see them. She put down her work and got up, thinking,“I will be the first to say, ‘Forgive me, '” but he did not seem to hear her. She went very slowly across the room, for pride was hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head. For a minute she felt as if she really couldn't do it, then came the thought, “This is the beginning. I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach myself with, ” and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the forehead. Of course that settled it. The penitent kiss was better than a world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying tenderly—

“It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me, dear. I never will again! ”

But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family peace was preserved in that little family jar.

After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first course; on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the way home.

In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg. Sallie Moffat renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house, or inviting “that poor dear” to come in and spend the day at the big house. It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often felt lonely;all were busy at home, John absent till night, and nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about. So it naturally fell out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend. Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself because she had not got them. Sallie was very kind, and often offered her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what John disliked even worse.

She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value more—his money. She knew where it was, was free to take what she liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's wife. Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without fear. But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress. Meg didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor;it irritated her, but she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she had to economize. She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty things were seldom necessaries; but then they cost so little, it wasn't worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.

But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her. John was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg never forgot it. A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and it weighed upon her conscience. Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg longed for a new one—just a handsome light one for parties, her black silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls. Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's; that was only a month to wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had the money, if she only dared to take it. John always said what was his was hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund? That was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to lend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg beyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely, shimmering folds, and said, “A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am.”She answered, “I'll take it, ” and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something, and the police were after her.

When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn't become her, after all, and the words “fifty dollars” seemed stamped like a pattern down each breadth. She put it away, but it haunted her, not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid. When John got out his books that night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time in her married life, she was afraid of her husband. The kind, brown eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had found her out, but didn't mean to let her know it. The house bills were all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was undoing the old pocketbook which they called the “bank”, when Meg, knowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously—

“You haven't seen my private expense book yet.”

John never asked to see it; but she always insisted on his doing so, and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted, and made him guess what “piping” was, demand fiercely the meaning of a“hug-me-tight”, or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a bonnet, and cost six dollars. That night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent wife.

The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic increasing with every word—

“John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really been dreadfully extravagant lately. I go about so much I must have things, you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did; and my New Year's money will partly pay for it: but I was sorry after I had done it, for I knew you'd think it wrong in me.”

John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,“Don't go and hide.I won't beat you if you have got a pair of killing boots. I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones.”

That had been one of her last “trifles”, and John's eye had fallen on it as he spoke.“Oh, what will he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars! ” thought Meg, with a shiver.

“It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress, ” she said, with the calmness of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.

“Well, dear, what is the ‘dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini says? ”

That didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now. She turned the page and her head at the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added. For a minute the room was very still, then John said slowly—but she could feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure—

“Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the furbelows and notions you have to finish it off these days.”

“It isn't made or trimmed, ” sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.

“Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman, but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's when she gets it on, ” said John dryly.

“I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it. I don't mean to waste your money, and I didn't think those little things would count up so. I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and pitying me because I don't. I try to be contented, but it is hard, and I'm tired of being poor.”

The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many pleasures for Meg's sake. She could have bitten her tongue out the minute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up, saying with a little quiver in his voice, “I was afraid of this. I do my best, Meg.” If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not have broken her heart like those few words. She ran to him and held him close, crying, with repentant tears, “Oh, John, my dear, kind, hard-working boy. I didn't mean it! It was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it! ”

He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach, but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again. She had promised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had reproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings recklessly. It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he stayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep. A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the discovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold. He had simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, “I can't afford it, my dear.”

Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would break.

They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him, given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved.

Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor. The good-natured Mrs. Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward. Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and, when John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new silk gown. One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his present, and what a blissful state of things ensued. John came home early, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife. So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to Meg a new experience—the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.

Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday, with an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, for Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other.

“How's the little mamma? Where is everybody? Why didn't you tell me before I came home? ” began Laurie in a loud whisper.

“Happy as a queen, the dear! Every soul of 'em is upstairs a worshipin'; we didn't want no hurrycanes round. Now you go into the parlor, and I'll send 'em down to you, ” with which somewhat involved reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.

Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow. Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.

“Shut your eyes and hold out your arms, ” she said invitingly.

Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture: “No, thank you. I'd rather not. I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate.”

“Then you shan't see your nevvy, ” said Jo decidedly, turning as if to go.

“I will, I will! Only you must be responsible for damages.” And obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms. A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah, and John caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself invested with two babies instead of one.

No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.

“Twins, by Jupiter! ” was all he said for a minute, then turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added, “Take 'em quick, somebody! I'm going to laugh, and I shall drop 'em.”

John rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm, as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending, while Laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.

“It's the best joke of the season, isn't it? I wouldn't have told you, for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I've done it, ” said Jo, when she got her breath.

“I never was more staggered in my life. Isn't it fun? Are they boys? What are you going to name them? Let's have another look. Hold me up, Jo, for upon my life it's one too many for me, ” returned Laurie, regarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens.

“Boy and girl. Aren't they beauties? ” said the proud papa, beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.

“Most remarkable children I ever saw. Which is which? ” and Laurie bent like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.

“Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French fashion, so you can always tell. Besides, one has blue eyes and one brown. Kiss them, Uncle Teddy, ” said wicked Jo.

“I'm afraid they mightn't like it, ” began Laurie, with unusual timidity in such matters.

“Of course they will, they are used to it now. Do it this minute, sir! ”commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.

Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.

“There, I knew they didn't like it! That's the boy, see him kick, he hits out with his fists like a good one. Now then, young Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you? ” cried Laurie, delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.

“He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother and grandmother. We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have two Megs, and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name, ” said Amy, with aunt-like interest.

“Name him Demijohn, and call him ‘Demi' for short, ” said Laurie

“Daisy and Demi—just the thing! I knew Teddy would do it, ” cried Jo clapping her hands.

Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were ‘Daisy' and‘Demi' to the end of the chapter.





CHAPTER 29

CALLS


“COME, JO, it's time.”

“For what? ”

“You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today? ”

“I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life, but I don't think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls in one day, when a single one upsets me for a week.”

“Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us. I was to finish the crayon of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me, and return our neighbors' visits.”

“If it was fair—that was in the bond; and I stand to the letter of my bond, Shylock. There is a pile of clouds in the east, it's not fair, and I don't go.”

“Now, that's shirking. It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you pride yourself on keeping promises; so be honorable, come and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months.”

At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking; for she was mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen. It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm July day. She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made any till Amy compelled her with a bargain, bribe, or promise. In the present instance there was no escape, and having clashed her scissors rebelliously, while protesting that she smelled thunder, she gave in, put away her work, and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.

“Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! You don't intend to make calls in that state, I hope, ” cried Amy, surveying her with amazement.

“Why not? I'm neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day. If people care more for my clothes than they do for me, I don't wish to see them. You can dress for both, and be as elegant as you please: it pays for you to be fine; it doesn't for me, and furbelows only worry me.”

“Oh, dear! ” sighed Amy, “now she's in a contrary fit, and will drive me distracted before I can get her properly ready. I'm sure it's no pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt we owe society, and there's no one to pay it but you and me. I'll do anything for you, Jo, if you'll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil. You can talk so well, look so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so beautifully, if you try, that I'm proud of you. I'm afraid to go alone, do come and take care of me.”

“You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way. The idea of my being aristocratic and well-bred, and your being afraid to go anywhere alone! I don't know which is the most absurd. Well, I'll go if I must, and do my best. You shall be commander of the expedition, and I'll obey blindly, will that satisfy you? ” said Jo, with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission.

“You're a perfect cherub! Now put on all your best things, and I'll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good impression. I want people to like you, and they would if you'd only try to be a little more agreeable. Do your hair the pretty way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet; it's becoming, and you look too sober in your plain suit. Take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief. We'll stop at Meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can have my dove-colored one.”

While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, not without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of countenance, saying meekly—

“I'm perfectly miserable; but if you consider me presentable, I die happy.”

“You're highly satisfactory; turn slowly round, and let me get a careful view.” Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and there, then fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously, “Yes, you'll do; your head is all I could ask,for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing.Hold back your shoulders, and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves do pinch. There's one thing you can do well, Jo, that is, wear a shawl—I can't; but it's very nice to see you, and I'm so glad Aunt March gave you that lovely one; it's simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic. Is the point of my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly?I like to show my boots,for my feet are pretty,though my nose isn't.”

“You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever, ” said Jo, looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair. “Am I to drag my best dress through the dust, or loop it up, please, ma'am? ”

“Hold it up when you walk, but drop it in the house. The sweeping style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully. You haven't half buttoned one cuff, do it at once. You'll never look finished if you are not careful about the little details, for they make up the pleasing whole.”

Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove, in doing up her cuff; but at last both were ready, and sailed away, looking as “pretty as picters, ” Hannah said, as she hung out of the upper window to watch them.

“Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant people, so I want you to put on your best deportment. Don't make any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you? Just be calm, cool, and quiet—that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes, ” said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm.

“Let me see. ‘Calm, cool, and quiet'—yes, I think I can promise that. I've played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and I'll try it off. My powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy in your mind, my child.”

Amy looked relieved, but naughtily Jo took her at her word, for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as silent as the sphinx. In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to her “charming novel”, and the Misses Chester introduced parties, picnics, the opera, and the fashions;each and all were answered by a smile, a bow, and a demure “Yes” or “No”with the chill on. In vain Amy telegraphed the word “talk”, tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. Jo sat as if blandly unconscious of it all, with deportment like Maud's face, “icily regular, splendidly null.”

“What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is! ”was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as the door closed upon their guests. Jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo.

“How could you mistake me so? I merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone. Try to be sociable at the Lambs', gossip as other girls do, and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up. They move in the best society, are valuable persons for us to know, and I wouldn't fail to make a good impression there for anything.”

“I'll be agreeable. I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like. I rather enjoy this, and now I'll imitate what is called ‘a charming girl'. I can do it, for I have May Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her. See if the Lambs don't say, ‘What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is! '”

Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop. Amy's face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss all the young ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young gentlemen, and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder. Amy was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she was a favorite, and forced to hear a long account of Lucretia's last attack, while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near, waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her. So situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the lady. A knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to hear what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with curiosity, and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun. One may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation:

“She rides splendidly—who taught her? ”

“No one. She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree. Now she rides anything, for she doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well. She has such a passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails, she can be a horsebreaker, and get her living so.”

At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady, which was her especial aversion. But what could she do? For the old lady was in the middle of her story, and long before it was done, Jo was off again, making more droll revelations and committing still more fearful blunders.

“Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone, and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn't it? ”

“Which did she choose? ” asked one of the laughing gentlemen, who enjoyed the subject.

“None of them. She heard of a young horse at the farmhouse over the river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved to try, because he was handsome and spirited. Her struggles were really pathetic; there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle, so she took the saddle to the horse. My dear creature, she actually rowed it over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man! ”

“Did she ride the horse? ”

“Of course she did, and had a capital time. I expected to see her brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and was the life of the party.”

“Well, I call that plucky! ” And young Mr. Lamb turned an approving glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable.

She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after, when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress. One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness, “Oh, Amy painted it. You can't buy those soft shades, so we paint ours any color we like. It's a great comfort to have an artistic sister.”

“Isn't that an original idea? ” cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.

“That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances. There's nothing the child can't do. Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin, ” added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments that exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her.

“We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much, ”observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary lady, who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.

Any mention of her “works” always had a bad effect upon Jo, who either grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject with a brusque remark, as now. “Sorry you could find nothing better to read. I write that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people like it. Are you going to New York this winter? ”

As Miss Lamb had “enjoyed” the story, this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary. The minute it was made Jo saw her mistake, but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure, and did so with an abruptness that left three people with half-finished sentences in their mouths.

“Amy, we must go. Good-by, dear, do come and see us. We are pining for a visit. I don't dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if you should come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away.”

Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's gushing style that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time.

“Didn't I do well? ” asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.

“Nothing could have been worse, ” was Amy's crushing reply. “What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and the hats and boots, and all the rest of it? ”

“Why, it's funny, and amuses people. They know we are poor, so it's no use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do.”

“You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and expose our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way. You haven't a bit of proper pride, and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak, ”said Amy despairingly.

Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors.

“How shall I behave here? ” she asked, as they approached the third mansion.

“Just as you please. I wash my hands of you, ” was Amy's short answer.

“Then I'll enjoy myself. The boys are at home, and we'll have a comfortable time. Goodness knows I need a little change, for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution, ” returned Jo gruffly, being disturbed by her failure to suit.

An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to entertain the hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, Jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing. She listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that “Tom Brown was a brick, ” regardless of the improper form of praise; and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma to smile upon her, as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired Frenchwoman.

Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her heart's content. Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of us—that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. But even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the British nobility did not render Amy forgetful of time, and when the proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society, and looked about for Jo, fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of March.

It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad; for Jo sat on the grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a dirty-footed dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress, as she related one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience. One small child was poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second was eating gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing ball with her gloves, but all were enjoying themselves, and when Jo collected her damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her, begging her to come again, “It was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks.”

“Capital boys, aren't they? I feel quite young and brisk again after that, ” said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her, partly from habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.

“Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor? ” asked Amy, wisely refraining from any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.

“Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries his father,and doesn't speak respectfully of his mother. Laurie says he is fast, and I don't consider him a desirable acquaintance, so I let him alone.”

“You might treat him civilly, at least. You gave him a cool nod, and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to Tommy Chamberlain, whose father keeps a grocery store. If you had just reversed the nod and the bow, it would have been right, ” said Amy reprovingly.

“No, it wouldn't, ” returned Jo, “I neither like, respect, nor admire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was a third cousin to a lord. Tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever. I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels.”

“It's no use trying to argue with you, ” began Amy.

“Not the least, my dear, ” interrupted Jo, “so let us look amiable, and drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out, for which I'm deeply grateful.”

The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being told that the young ladies were engaged.

“Now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today. We can run down there any time, and it's really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross.”

“Speak for yourself, if you please. Aunt March likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call; it's a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them. Stoop down, and let me take the crumbs off your bonnet.”

“What a good girl you are, Amy! ” said Jo, with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which was fresh and spotless still. “I wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you. I think of them, but it takes too much time to do them; so I wait for a chance to confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip; but they tell best in the end, I fancy.”

Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal air,“Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones, for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive. If you'd remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked than I am, because there is more of you.”

“I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm willing to own that you are right, only it's easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don't feel like it. It's a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn't it? ”

“It's a greater not to be able to hide them. I don't mind saying that I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm not called upon to tell him so; neither are you, and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is.”

“But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men, and how can they do it except by their manners? Preaching does not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've had Teddy to manage; but there are many little ways in which I can influence him without a word, and I say we ought to do it to others if we can.”

“Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample of other boys, ” said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which would have convulsed the “remarkable boy” if he had heard it. “If we were belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don't approve of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn't have a particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and puritanical.”

“So we are to countenance things and people which we detest, merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we? That's a nice sort of morality.”

“I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of the world, and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains. I don't like reformers, and I hope you never try to be one.”

“I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on without them. We can't agree about that, for you belong to the old set, and I to the new: you will get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it. I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think.”

“Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your new ideas.”

“I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her. It's my doom, and I can't help it.”

They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in some very interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls came in, with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces. Jo was not in a good humor, and the perverse fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty, kept her temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame of mind. This amiable spirit was felt at once, and both aunts “my deared” her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically, “That child improves every day.”

“Are you going to help about the fair, dear? ” asked Mrs. Carrol, as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young.

“Yes, Aunt. Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give.”

“I'm not, ” put in Jo decidedly. “I hate to be patronized, and the Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair. I wonder you consented, Amy, they only want you to work.”

“I am willing to work: it's for the freedmen as well as the Chesters, and I think it is very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun. Patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant.”

“Quite right and proper. I like your grateful spirit, my dear; it's a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts: some do not, and that is trying, ” observed Aunt March, looking over her spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat morose expression.

If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them, she would have turned dovelike in a minute; but, unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts, and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends; better for us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. By her next speech, Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue.

“I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave. I'd rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent.”

“Ahem! ” coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.

“I told you so, ” said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.

Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.

“Do you speak French, dear? ” asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy's.

“Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to me as often as I like, ” replied Amy, with a grateful look, which caused the old lady to smile affably.

“How are you about languages? ” asked Mrs. Carrol of Jo.

“Don't know a word. I'm very stupid about studying anything, can't bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language, ” was the brusque reply.

Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said to Amy,“You are quite strong and well, now, dear, I believe? Eyes don't trouble you any more, do they? ”

“Not at all, thank you, ma'am. I'm very well, and mean to do great things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever that joyful time arrives.”

“Good girl! You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some day, ” said Aunt March, with an approving pat on the head, as Amy picked up her ball for her.





Crosspatch, draw the latch,

Sit by the fire and spin,





squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing.

“Most observing bird, ” said the old lady.

“Come and take a walk, my dear? ” cried Polly, hopping toward the china closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.

“Thank you, I will. Come, Amy.” And Jo brought the visit to an end, feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution. She shook hands in a gentlemanly manner, but Amy kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed, leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine, which impression caused Aunt March to say, as they vanished—

“You'd better do it, Mary. I'll supply the money.” and Aunt Carrol to reply decidedly, “I certainly will, if her father and mother consent.”





CHAPTER 30

CONSEQUENCES


MRS. CHESTER'S fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table, and everyone was much interested in the matter. Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was fortunate for all parties, as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life, and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily. The “haughty, uninteresting creature” was let severely alone, but Amy's talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it.

Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young, with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together.

May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself, and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling. Amy's dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted vases—that was one thorn; then the all-conquering Tudor had danced four times with Amy at a late party and only once with May—that was thorn number two; but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'. All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection, and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape. No hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay can be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look—

“I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls. As this is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive table of all, and they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it is thought best for them to take this place. I'm sorry, but I know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment, and you shall have another table if you like.”

Mrs. Chester had fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble.

Amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did, “Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all? ”

“Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg; it's merely a matter of expediency, you see; my girls will naturally take the lead, and this table is considered their proper place. I think it very appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty; but we must give up our private wishes, of course, and I will see that you have a good place elsewhere. Wouldn't you like the flower table? The little girls undertook it, but they are discouraged. You could make a charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive, you know.”

“Especially to gentlemen, ” added May, with a look which enlightened Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor. She colored angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm, and answered with unexpected amiability—

“It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester. I'll give up my place here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like.”

“You can put your own things on your own table, if you prefer, ” began May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she looked at the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint illuminations Amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged. She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly—

“Oh, certainly, if they are in your way, ” and sweeping her contributio-ns into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.

“Now she's mad. Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak, Mama, ”said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.

“Girls' quarrels are soon over, ” returned her mother, feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.

The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight, which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not artistically. But everything seemed against her; it was late, and she was tired; everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her; and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. The evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled; her best tile got a splash of water, which left a sepia tear on the Cupid's cheek; she bruised her hands with hammering, and got cold working in a draft, which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow. Any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through her task.

There was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening. Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she had done right. Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all, and Jo demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her.

“Because they are mean is no reason why I should be. I hate such things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't intend to show it. They will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions, won't they, Marmee? ”

“That's the right spirit, my dear; a kiss for a blow is always best, though it's not very easy to give it sometimes, ” said her mother, with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practicing.

In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate, Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent on conquering her enemy by kindness. She began well, thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely. As she arranged her table that morning, while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets, she took up her pet production—a little book, the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures, and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts. As she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride, her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think. Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue, and gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers, were the words, “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

“I ought, but I don't, ” thought Amy, as her eye went from the bright page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled. Amy stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit. Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street, school, office, or home; even a fair table may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season. Amy's conscience preached her a little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what many of us do not always do—took the sermon to heart, and straightway put it in practice.

A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring the pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen. They dropped their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly. It was not pleasant, but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. She heard May say sorrowfully—

“It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and I don't want to fill up with odds and ends. The table was just complete then: now it's spoiled.”

“I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her, ” suggested someone.

“How could I after all the fuss? ” began May, but she did not finish, for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly—

“You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want them. I was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they belong to your table rather than mine. Here they are, please take them, and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night.”

As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.

“Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you? ” cried one girl.

May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable laugh, “Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't sell them at her own table.”

Now, that was hard; when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry she had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its own reward. But it is—as she presently discovered—for her spirits began to rise, and her table to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls were very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly.

It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind her table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted very soon: few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets began to droop long before night.

The art table was the most attractive in the room;there was a crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes. Amy often looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt at home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do. It might seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of Laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom.

She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. Her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea. Beth helped her dress, and made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned.

“Don't do anything rude, pray, Jo. I won't have any fuss made, so let it all pass and behave yourself, ” begged Amy, as she departed early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table.

“I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to everyone I know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible. Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet, ” returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie. Presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.

“Is that my boy? ”

“As sure as this is my girl! ” And Laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.

“Oh, Teddy, such doings! ” And Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.

“A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and I'll be hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and camp down before her table afterward, ” said Laurie, espousing her cause with warmth.

“The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones may not arrive in time. I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious, but I shouldn't wonder if they never came at all. When people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another, ” observed Jo in a disgusted tone.

“Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to.”

“I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some.”

“Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking! They are just as much yours as mine. Don't we always go halves in everything? ”began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo turn thorny.

“Gracious, I hope not! Half of some of your things wouldn't suit me at all. But we mustn't stand philandering here. I've got to help Amy, so you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the Hall, I'll bless you forever.”

“Couldn't you do it now? ” asked Laurie, so suggestively that Jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called through the bars, “Go away, Teddy, I'm busy.”

Thanks to the conspirators,the tables were turned that night,for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece; then the March family turned out en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring Amy's taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much. Laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room. Amy was in her element now, and out of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious as possible—coming to the conclusion,about that time,that virtue was its own reward, after all.

Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the hall, picking up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon the subject of the Chester change of base. She reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as soon as possible. She also discovered what Amy had done about the things in the morning, and considered her a model of magnanimity. As she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister's things, but saw no sign of them. “Tucked away out of sight, I dare say, ” thought Jo, who could forgive her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family.

“Good evening, Miss Jo. How does Amy get on? ” asked May with a conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be generous.

“She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is enjoying herself. The flower table is always attractive, you know,‘especially to gentlemen.'”

Jo couldn't resist giving that little slap,but May took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising the great vases, which still remained unsold.

“Is Amy's illumination anywhere about? I took a fancy to buy that for Father, ” said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister's work.

“Everything of Amy's sold long ago; I took care that the right people saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money for us, ” returned May, who had overcome sundry small temptations, as well as Amy had, that day.

Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and Amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of May's word and manner.

“Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine—especially the art table, ” she said, ordering out “Teddy's own”, as the girls called the college friends.

“‘Charge, Chester, charge! ' is the motto for that table, but do your duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art in every sense of the word, ” said the irrepressible Jo, as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field.

“To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May, ” said little Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender, and getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said, “Very well, my son, for a small boy! ” and walked him off, with a paternal pat on the head.

“Buy the vases, ” whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping of coals of fire on her enemy's head.

To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases, but pervaded the hall with one under each arm. The other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases.

Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and said something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety,though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later.

The fair was pronounced a success; and when May bade Amy goodnight, she did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate kiss, and a look which said “forgive and forget”. That satisfied Amy, and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each. “The reward of merit for a magnanimous March, ” as Laurie announced with a flourish.

“You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than I ever gave you credit for, Amy. You've behaved sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart, ” said Jo warmly, as they brushed their hair together late that night.

“Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. It must have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things. I don't believe I could have done it as kindly as you did, ” added Beth from her pillow.

“Why, girls, you needn't praise me so. I only did as I'd be done by. You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do it as far as I know how. I can't explain exactly, but I want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women. I'm far from it now, but I do my best, and hope in time to be what Mother is.”

Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, “I understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again. You are getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons of you in true politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe. Try away, deary, you'll get your reward some day, and no one will be more delighted than I shall.”

A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it hard to be delighted. A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs. March's face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that Jo and Beth, who were with her, demanded what the glad tidings were.

“Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants—”

“Me to go with her! ” burst in Jo, flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture.

“No, dear, not you; it's Amy.”

“Oh, Mother! She's too young, it's my turn first. I've wanted it so long. it would do me so much good,and be so altogether splendid—I must go! ”

“I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo. Aunt says Amy, decidedly, and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor.”

“It's always so. Amy has all the fun and I have all the work. It isn't fair, oh, it isn't fair! ” cried Jo passionately.

“I'm afraid it's partly your own fault, dear. When Aunt spoke to me the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit; and here she writes, as if quoting something you had said—‘I planned at first to ask Jo, but as “favors burden her, ” and she “hates French, ” I think I won't venture to invite her. Amy is more docile, will make a good companion for Flo, and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her.'”

“Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue! Why can't I learn to keep it quiet? ” groaned Jo, remembering words which had been her undoing. When she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases, Mrs. March said sorrowfully—

“I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this time, so try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure by reproaches or regrets.”

“I'll try, ” said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset. “I'll take a leaf out of her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute of happiness; but it won't be easy, for it is a dreadful disappointment.” And poor Jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.

“Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and I'm glad you are not going quite yet, ” whispered Beth, embracing her, basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden her with this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it.

By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps, but without repinings at Amy's good fortune. The young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself.

“It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls, ” she said impressively, as she scraped her best palette. “It will decide my career, for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome, and will do something to prove it.”

“Suppose you haven't? ” said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy.

“Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living, ” replied the aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure. But she made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes.

“No, you won't. You hate hard work, and you'll marry some rich man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days, ” said Jo.

“Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe that one will. I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be an artist myself, I should like to be able to help those who are, ” said Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawing teacher.

“Hum! ” said Jo, with a sigh. “If you wish it you'll have it, for your wishes are always granted—mine never.”

“Would you like to go? ” asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife.

“Rather! ”

“Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in the Forum for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so many times.”

“Thank you. I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes, if it ever does, ” returned Jo, accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.

There was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment till Amy was off. Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried till she couldn't cry any more. Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed. Then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last lingerer, saying with a sob—

“Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should happen—”

“I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I'll come and comfort you, ” whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word.

So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always new and beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend watched her from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea.





CHAPTER 31

OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT


London

Dearest People,

Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel, Piccadilly. It's not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped here years ago, and won't go anywhere else; however, we don't mean to stay long, so it's no great matter. Oh, I can't begin to tell you how I enjoy it all! I never can, so I'll only give you bits out of my notebook, for I've done nothing but sketch and scribble since I started.

I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable, but after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all day, with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me. Everyone was very kind to me, especially the officers. Don't laugh, Jo, gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to, or to wait upon one; and as they have nothing to do, it's a mercy to make them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death, I'm afraid.

Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I went and enjoyed myself. Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid air and waves! It was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse, when we went rushing on so grandly. I wish Beth could have come, it would have done her so much good; as for Jo, she would have gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or whatever the high thing is called, made friends with the engineers, and tooted on the captain's speaking trumpet, she'd have been in such a state of rapture.

It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's countryseats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks. It was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to see it,for the bay was full of little boats,the shore so picturesque, and a rosy sky overhead. I never shall forget it.

At Queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, Mr. Lennox, and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney, he sighed, and sung, with a look at me—





Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?

She lives on the banks of Killarney;

From the glance of her eye,

Shun danger and fly,

For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney.





Wasn't that nonsensical?

We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours. It's a dirty, noisy place, and I was glad to leave it. Uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved à la mutton chop, the first thing. Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton, but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the little bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said, with a grin, “There yer har, sir. I've given 'em the latest Yankee shine.”It amused Uncle immensely.Oh,I must tell you what that absurd Lennox did! He got his friend Ward, who came on with us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I saw in my room was a lovely one, with “Robert Lennox's compliments, ” on the card. Wasn't that fun, girls? I like traveling.

I never shall get to London if I don't hurry.The trip was like riding through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes. The farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs, ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy children at the doors. The very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got nervous like Yankee biddies. Such perfect color I never saw—the grass so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark—I was in a rapture all the way. So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to the other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Aunt was tired and went to sleep, but Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn't be astonished at anything. This is the way we went on: Amy, flying up— “Oh, that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees! ” Flo, darting to my window—“How sweet! We must go there sometime, won't we Papa? ”Uncle, calmly admiring his boots— “No, my dear, not unless you want beer, that's a brewery.”

A pause—then Flo cried out, “Bless me, there's a gallows and a man going up.” “Where, where? ” shrieks Amy, staring out at two tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains. “A colliery, ” remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. “Here's a lovely flock of lambs all lying down, ” says Amy. “See, Papa, aren't they pretty? ” added Flo sentimentally. “Geese, young ladies, ” returns Uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to enjoy The Flirtations of Captain Cavendish, and I have the scenery all to myself.

Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas. We rested, unpacked, and shopped a little between the showers. Aunt Mary got me some new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready. A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw. Shopping in Regent Street is perfectly splendid; Things seem so cheap—nice ribbons only sixpence a yard. I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves in Paris. Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?

Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while Aunt and Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in them alone. It was so droll! For when we were shut in by the wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and told me to stop him, but he was up outside behind somewhere, and I couldn't get at him. He didn't hear me call, nor see me flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless, rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace. At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said—

“Now then, mum? ”

I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down the door, with an “Aye, aye, mum, ” the man made his horse walk, as if going to a funeral. I poked again and said, “A little faster, ” then off he went, helter-skelter as before, and we resigned ourselves to our fate.

Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we are more aristocratic than we look. The Duke of Devonshire lives near. I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate; and the Duke of Wellington's house is not far off. Such sights as I saw, my dear! It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front. Smart maids, with the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch them.

Rotten Row means“Route de Roi”,or the king's way,but now it's more like a riding school than anything else. The horses are splendid, and the men, especially the grooms, ride well; but the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn't according to our rules. I longed to show them a tearing American gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah's Ark. Everyone rides—old men, stout ladies, little children—and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I saw a pair exchange rose buds, for it's the thing to wear one in the buttonhole, and I thought it rather a nice little idea.

In the P.M. to Westminster Abbey, but don't expect me to describe it, that's impossible—so I'll only say it was sublime! This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate end to the happiest day of my life.

MIDNIGHT

It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning without telling you what happened last evening. Who do you think came in, as we were at tea? Laurie's English friends, Fred and Frank Vaughn! I was so surprised, for I shouldn't have known them but for the cards. Both are tall fellows with whiskers, Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better, for he only limps slightly, and uses no crutches. They had heard from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their house;but Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call, and see them as we can. They went to the theater with us, and we did have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and Fred and I talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other all our days. Tell Beth Frank asked for her, and was sorry to hear of her ill health. Fred laughed when I spoke of Jo, and sent his “respectful compliments to the big hat.” Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we had there. What ages ago it seems, doesn't it?

Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time,so I must stop.I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head a jumble of parks, theaters, new gowns,and gallant creatures who say “Ah! ” and twirl their blond mustaches with the true English lordliness. I long to see you all, and in spite of my nonsense am, as ever, your loving—

AMY

PARIS

Dear girls,

In my last I told you about our London visit—how kind the Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they made for us. I enjoyed the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than anything else—for at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and at the Museum, rooms full of pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds, Hogarth, and the other great creatures. The day in Richmond Park was charming, for we had a regular English picnic, and I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I could copy; also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up. We “did”London to our heart's content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry to go away; for though English people are slow to take you in, when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone in hospitality, Ithink.The Vaughns hope to meet us in Rome next winter,and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they don't, for Grace and I are great friends, and the boys very nice fellows—especially Fred.

Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again, saying he had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland. Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn't say a word; and now we get on nicely, and are very glad he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don't know what we should do without him. Uncle doesn't know ten words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if it would make people understand him. Aunt's pronunciation is old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves that we knew a good deal,find we don't,and are very grateful to have Fred do the“parley vooing, ”as Uncle calls it.

Such delightful times as we are having! Sight-seeing from morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafés, and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. Rainy days I spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures. Jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no soul for art, but I have, and I'm cultivating eye and taste as fast as I can. She would like the relics of great people better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and gray coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush; also Marie Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword, and many other interesting things. I'll talk for hours about them when I come, but haven't time to write.

The Palais Royale is a heavenly place—so full of bijouterie and lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't buy them. Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't allow it. Then the Bois and Champs Elysées are très magnifique.I've seen the imperial family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought—purple dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. Little Nap is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind.

We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are lovely, though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better. Père la Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in, one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament. That is so Frenchy.

Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the balcony, we look up and down the long, brilliant street. It is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when too tired with our day's work to go out. Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever knew—except Laurie, whose manners are more charming. I wish Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men, however, the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won't find fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.

Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as we shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty letters. I keep my diary, and try to “remember correctly and describe clearly all that I see and admire, ” as Father advised. It is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.

Adieu, I embrace you tenderly.

VOTRE AMIE

HEIDELBERG

My Dear Mamma,

Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to tell you what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you will see.

The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed it with all my might. Get Father's old guidebooks and read about it. I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it. At Coblentz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn, with whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade. It was a moonlight night, and about one o'clock Flo and I were waked by the most delicious music under our windows. We flew up, and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and the students singing away down below. It was the most romantic thing I ever saw—the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.

When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing away—to smoke and drink beer, I suppose. Next morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very sentimental. I laughed at him, and said I didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him, for he tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again. I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to look like it.

The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden, where Fred lost some money, and I scolded him. He needs someone to look after him when Frank is not with him. Kate said once she hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her that it would be well for him. Frankfurt was delightful; I saw Goethe's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous Ariadne.It was very lovely,but I should have enjoyed it more if I had known the story better. I didn't like to ask, as everyone knew it or pretended they did. I wish Jo would tell me all about it; I ought to have read more, for I find I don't know anything, and it mortifies me.

Now comes the serious part—for it happened here, and Fred has just gone. He has been so kind and jolly that we all got quite fond of him. I never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night. Since then I've begun to feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures were something more to him than fun. I haven't flirted, Mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and have done my very best. I can't help it if people like me; I don't try to make them, and it worries me if I don't care for them, though Jo says I haven't got any heart. Now I know Mother will shake her head, and the girls say, “Oh, the mercenary little wretch! ” but I've made up my mind,and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him, though I'm not madly in love. I like him, and we get on comfortably together. He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich—ever so much richer than the Laurences. I don't think his family would object, and I should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like me. Fred, as the eldest twin, will have the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid one it is! A city house in a fashionable street, not so showy as our big houses, but twice as comfortable and full of solid luxury, such as English people believe in. I like it, for it's genuine. I've seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. Oh, it would be all I should ask! And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily, and find nothing behind. I may be mercenary, but I hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer than I can help.One of us must marry well; Meg didn't, Jo won't, Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all round. I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised. You may be sure of that; and though Fred is not my model hero, he does very well, and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was very fond of me, and let me do just as I liked. So I've been turning the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible to help seeing that Fred liked me. He said nothing, but little things showed it; he never goes with Flo, always gets on my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me. Yesterday at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then said something to his friend—a rakish-looking baron—about“ein wonderschönes Blöndchen”,Fred looked as fierce as a lion,and cut his meat so savagely it nearly flew off his plate. He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.

Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset—at least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to the Post Restante for letters. We had a charming time poking about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his English wife. I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. I felt as if I'd got into a romance, sitting there,watching the Neckar rolling through the valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl. I had a feeling that something was going to happen and I was ready for it. I didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little excited.

By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying through the great arch to find me. He looked so troubled that I forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was. He said he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was very ill; so he was going at once on the night train and only had time to say good-by. I was very sorry for him, and disappointed for myself, but only for a minute because he said, as he shook hands—and said it in a way that I could not mistake—“I shall soon come back, you won't forget me, Amy? ”

I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied, and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes, for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much. I know he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised his father not to do anything of the sort yet a while, for he is a rash boy, and the old gentleman dreads a foreign daughter-in-law. We shall soon meet in Rome, and then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say “Yes, thank you, ” when he says “Will you, please? ”

Of course this is all very private,but I wished you to know what was going on. Don't be anxious about me, remember I am your “prudent Amy”, and be sure I will do nothing rashly. Send me as much advice as you like. I'll use it if I can. I wish I could see you for a good talk, Marmee. Love and trust me.

Ever your

AMY





CHAPTER 32

TENDER TROUBLES


“JO, I'M ANXIOUS ABOUT BETH.”

“Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the babies came.”

“It's not her health that troubles me now, it's her spirits. I'm sure there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover what it is.”

“What makes you think so, Mother? ”

“She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father as much as she used. I found her crying over the babies the other day. When she sings, the songs are always sad ones, and now and then I see a look in her face that I don't understand. This isn't like Beth, and it worries me.”

“Have you asked her about it? ”

“I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my questions or looked so distressed that I stopped. I never force my children's confidence, and I seldom have to wait for long.”

Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude but Beth's, and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo said, “I think she is growing up, and so begins to dream dreams, and have hopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why or being able to explain them. Why, Mother, Beth's eighteen, but we don't realize it, and treat her like a child, forgetting she's a woman.”

“So she is. Dear heart, how fast you do grow up, ” returned her mother with a sigh and a smile.

“Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to all sorts of worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest, one by one. I promise never to hop very far, if that is any comfort to you.”

“It's a great comfort, Jo. I always feel strong when you are at home, now Meg is gone. Beth is too feeble and Amy too young to depend upon, but when the tug comes, you are always ready.”

“Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there must always be one scrub in a family. Amy is splendid in fine works and I'm not, but I feel in my element when all the carpets are to be taken up, or half the family fall sick at once. Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but if anything is amiss at home, I'm your man.”

“I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her tender little heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else. Be very kind, and don't let her think anyone watches or talks about her. If she only would get quite strong and cheerful again, I shouldn't have a wish in the world.”

“Happy woman! I've got heaps.”

“My dear, what are they? ”

“I'll settle Beth's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine. They are not very wearing, so they'll keep.” And Jo stitched away, with a wise nod which set her mother's heart at rest about her for the present at least.

While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched Beth, and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her. A slight incident gave Jo the clue to the mystery, she thought, and lively fancy, loving heart did the rest. She was affecting to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she and Beth were alone together; yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on her sister, who seemed unusually quiet. Sitting at the window, Beth's work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull, autumnal landscape. Suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out,“All serene! Coming in tonight.”

Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, “How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks.”

“Hum! ” said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face, for the bright color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge. Beth whisked it off, and glanced apprehensively at Jo, but she was scratching away at a tremendous rate, apparently engrossed in Olympia's Oath.The instant Beth turned,Jo began her watch again, saw Beth's hand go quietly to her eyes more than once, and in her half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill. Fearing to betray herself, she slipped away, murmuring something about needing more paper.

“Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie! ” she said, sitting down in her own room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she believed she had just made.“I never dreamed of such a thing.What will Mother say?I wonder if her—” there Jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought. “If he shouldn't love back again, how dreadful it would be. He must. I'll make him! ” And she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous-looking boy laughing at her from the wall.“Oh dear,we are growing up with a vengeance. Here's Meg married and a mamma, Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love. I'm the only one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief.” Jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face opposite, “No thank you, sir, you're very charming, but you've no more stability than a weathercock. So you needn't write touching notes and smile in that insinuating way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I won't have it.”

Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new observations, which only confirmed her suspicion. Though Laurie flirted with Amy and joked with Jo, his manner to Beth had always been peculiarly kind and gentle, but so was everybody's. Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he cared more for her than for the others. Indeed, a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that “our boy” was getting fonder than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. If they had known the various tender passages which had been nipped in the bud, they would have had the immense satisfaction of saying, “I told you so.” But Jo hated “philandering, ” and wouldn't allow it, always having a joke or a smile ready at the least sign of impending danger.

When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month, but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much amused Jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope, despair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly conferences. But there came a time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally in Byronic fits of gloom. Then he avoided the tender subject altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious, and gave out that he was going to“dig, ” intending to graduate in a blaze of glory. This suited the young lady better than twilight confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the eye, for with Jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were less manageable.

Things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done before. If she had not got the new idea into her head, she would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that Beth was very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her. But having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course of romance writing, did not come to the rescue. As usual Beth lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly “spin”, and he never disappointed her. But that evening Jo fancied that Beth's eyes rested on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match, though the phrases, “caught off a tice”,“stumped off his ground”, and “the leg hit for three” were as intelligible to her as Sanskrit. She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it, that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner, that he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual, was a little absent-minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender.

“Who knows? Stranger things have happened, ” thought Jo, as she fussed about the room. “She will make quite an angel of him, and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant for the dear, if they only love each other. I don't see how he can help it, and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of the way.”

As everyone was out of the way but herself,Jo began to feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed. But where should she go? And burning to lay herself upon the shrine of sisterly devotion, she sat down to settle that point.

Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa—long, broad, well-cushioned, and low; a trifle shabby, as well it might be, for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies, fished over the back, rode on the arms, and had menageries under it as children, and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams, and listened to tender talk on it as young women. They all loved it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always been Jo's favorite lounging place. Among the many pillows that adorned the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end. This repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.

Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he most coveted next to Jo in the sofa corner. If “the sausage” as they called it, stood on end, it was a sign that he might approach and repose; but if it lay flat across the sofa, woe to man, woman, or child who dared disturb it! That evening Jo forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat five minutes, before a massive form appeared beside her, and with both arms spread over the sofa back, both long legs stretched out before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction—

“Now,this is filling at the price.”

“No slang, ” snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow. But it was too late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared in a most mysterious manner.

“Come, Jo, don't be thorny. After studying himself to a skeleton all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get it.”

“Beth will pet you. I'm busy.”

“No, she's not to be bothered with me; but you like that sort of thing, unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it. Have you? Do you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him? ”

Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom heard, but Jo quenched “her boy” by turning on him with a stern query,“How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week? ”

“Not one, upon my word. She's engaged. Now then.”

“I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances—sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two pins, ” continued Jo reprovingly.

“Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't let me send them ‘flowers and things', so what can I do? My feelings need a‘vent'.”

“Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do flirt desperately, Teddy.”

“I'd give anything if I could answer, ‘So do you.' As I can't, I'll merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little game, if all parties understand that it's only play.”

“Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done. I've tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as everybody else is doing, but I don't seem to get on, ” said Jo, forgetting to play mentor.

“Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it.”

“Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far. I suppose it's natural to some people to please without trying, and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place.”

“I'm glad you can't flirt. It's really refreshing to see a sensible, straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without making a fool of herself. Between ourselves, Jo, some of the girls I know really do go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them. They don't mean any harm, I'm sure, but if they knew how we fellows talked about them afterward, they'd mend their ways, I fancy.”

“They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit. If you behaved properly, they would, but knowing you like their nonsense, they keep it up, and then you blame them.”

“Much you know about it, ma'am, ” said Laurie in a superior tone.“We don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if we did sometimes. The pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully, among gentleman. Bless your innocent soul! If you could be in my place for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle. Upon my word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls, I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin—





Out upon you, fie upon you,

Bold-faced jig! ”





It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict between Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind, and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of which fashionable society showed him many samples. Jo knew that “young Laurence” was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mammas, was much smiled upon by their daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls. Returning suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said, dropping her voice,“If you must have a‘Went',Teddy,go and devote yourself to one of the ‘pretty, modest girls' whom you do respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones.”

“You really advise it? ” And Laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face.

“Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through college, on the whole, and be fitting yourself for the place meantime. You're not half good enough for—well, whoever the modest girl may be.” And Jo looked a little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her.

“That I'm not! ” acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently wound Jo's apron tassel round his finger.

“Mercy on us, this will never do.” thought Jo, adding aloud, “Go and sing to me. I'm dying for some music, and always like yours.”

“I'd rather stay here, thank you.”

“Well, you can't, there isn't room. Go and make yourself useful, since you are too big to be ornamental. I thought you hated to be tied to a woman's apron string? ” retorted Jo, quoting certain rebellious words of his own.

“Ah, that depends on who wears the apron! ” and Laurie gave an audacious tweak at the tassel.

“Are you going? ” demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.

He fled at once, and the minute it was well, “Up with the bonnets of bonnie Dundee, ” she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.

Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth's bedside, with the anxious inquiry, “What is it, dear? ”

“I thought you were asleep, ” sobbed Beth.

“Is it the old pain, my precious? ”

“No, it's a new one, but I can bear it.” And Beth tried to check her tears.

“Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did the other.”

“You can't, there is no cure.” There Beth's voice gave way, and clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly that Jo was frightened.

“Where is it? Shall I call Mother? ”

“No, no, don't call her, don't tell her. I shall be better soon. Lie down here and ‘poor' my head. I'll be quiet and go to sleep, indeed I will.”

Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across Beth's hot forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full and she longed to speak. But young as she was, Jo had learned that hearts, like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she believed she knew the cause of Beth's new pain, she only said, in her tenderest tone, “Does anything trouble you, deary? ”

“Yes, Jo, ” after a long pause.

“Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is? ”

“Not now, not yet.”

“Then I won't ask, but remember, Beth, that Mother and Jo are always glad to hear and help you, if they can.”

“I know it. I'll tell you by-and-by.”

“Is the pain better now? ”

“Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo.”

“Go to sleep, dear. I'll stay with you.”

So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow Beth seemed quite herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long, and a loving word can medicine most ills.

But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a project for some days, she confided it to her mother.

“You asked me the other day what my wishes were. I'll tell you one of them, Marmee, ” she began, as they sat along together. “I want to go away somewhere this winter for a change.”

“Why, Jo? ” And her mother looked up quickly, as if the words suggested a double meaning.

With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, “I want something new. I feel restless and anxious to be seeing, doing, and learning more than I am. I brood too much over my own small affairs, and need stirring up, so as I can be spared this winter, I'd like to hop a little way and try my wings.”

“Where will you hop? ”

“To New York. I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is it. You know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable young person to teach her children and sew. It's rather hard to find just the thing, but I think I should suit if I tried.”

“My dear, go out to service in that great boardinghouse! ” And Mrs. March looked surprised, but not displeased.

“It's not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is your friend—the kindest soul that ever lived—and would make things pleasant for me, I know. Her family is separate from the rest, and no one knows me there. Don't care if they do. It's honest work, and I'm not ashamed of it.”

“Nor I. But your writing? ”

“All the better for the change. I shall see and hear new things, get new ideas, and, even if I haven't much time there, I shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish.”

“I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for this sudden fancy? ”

“No, Mother.”

“May I know the others? ”

Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in her cheeks. “It may be vain and wrong to say it, but—I'm afraid—Laurie is getting too fond of me.”

“Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he begins to care for you? ” and Mrs. March looked anxious as she put the question.

“Mercy, no! I love the dear boy, as I always have, and am immensely proud of him, but as for anything more, it's out of the question.”

“I'm glad of that, Jo.”

“Why, please? ”

“Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another. As friends you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over, but I fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life. You are too much alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention hot tempers and strong wills, to get on happily together, in a relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance, as well as love.”

“That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it. I'm glad you think he is only beginning to care for me. It would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I? ”

“You are sure of his feeling for you? ”

The color deepened in Jo's cheeks as she answered, with the look of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers, “I'm afraid it is so, Mother. He hasn't said anything, but he looks a great deal. I think I had better go away before it comes to anything.”

“I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go.”

Jo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, “How Mrs. Moffat would wonder at your want of management, if she knew, and how she will rejoice that Annie may still hope.”

“Ah, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the hope is the same in all—the desire to see their children happy. Meg is so, and I am content with her success. You I leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it, for only then will you find that there is something sweeter. Amy is my chief care now, but her good sense will help her. For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she may be well. By the way, she seems brighter this last day or two. Have you spoken to her? '

“Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by. I said no more, for I think I know it.” And Jo told her little story.

Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic a view of the case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion that for Laurie's sake Jo should go away for a time.

“Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled, then I'll run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic. Beth must think I'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't talk about Laurie to her. But she can pet and comfort him after I'm gone, and so cure him of this romantic notion. He's been through so many little trials of the sort, he's used to it, and will soon get over his lovelornity.”

Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding fear that this “little trial” would be harder than the others, and that Laurie would not get over his “lovelornity” as easily as heretofore.

The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed upon, for Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to make a pleasant home for her. The teaching would render her independent, and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable. Jo liked the prospect and was eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow for her restless nature and adventurous spirit. When all was settled, with fear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her surprise he took it very quietly. He had been graver than usual of late, but very pleasant, and when jokingly accused of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, “So I am, and I mean this one shall stay turned.”

Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart—for Beth seemed more cheerful—and hoped she was doing the best for all.

“One thing I leave in your especial care, ” she said, the night before she left.

“You mean your papers? ” asked Beth.

“No, my boy. Be very good to him, won't you? ”

“Of course I will, but I can't fill your place, and he'll miss you sadly.”

“It won't hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your charge, to plague, pet, and keep in order.”

“I'll do my best, for your sake, ” promised Beth, wondering why Jo looked at her so queerly.

When Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, “It won't do a bit of good, Jo. My eye is on you, so mind what you do, or I'll come and bring you home.”





CHAPTER 33

JO'S JOURNAL


New York, November

Dear Marmee and Beth,

I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps to tell, though I'm not a fine young lady traveling on the continent. When I lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt a trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less, hadn't diverted my mind, for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar.

Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.

Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once, even in that big house full of strangers. She gave me a funny little sky parlor—all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever I like. A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot. The nursery, where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next Mrs. Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty children—rather spoiled, I fancy,but they took to me after telling them The Seven Bad Pigs,and I've no doubt I shall make a model governess.

I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to the great table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful, though no one will believe it.

“Now, my dear, make yourself at home, ” said Mrs. K. in her motherly way, “I'm on the drive from morning to night, as you may suppose with such a family, but a great anxiety will be off my mind if I know the children are safe with you. My rooms are always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I can make it. There are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. Come to me if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. There's the tea bell, I must run and change my cap.” And off she bustled, leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.

As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked. The flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl to lumber up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the heavy hod of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put it down at a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind nod and a foreign accent, “It goes better so. The little back is too young to haf such heaviness.”

Wasn't it good of him? I like such things, for as Father says, trifles show character. When I mentioned it to Mrs. K., that evening, she laughed, and said, “That must have been Professor Bhaer, he's always doing things of that sort.”

Mrs. K. told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good, but poor as a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according to the wishes of his sister, who married an American. Not a very romantic story, but it interested me, and I was glad to hear that Mrs. K. lends him her parlor for some of his scholars. There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he looks. He's almost forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.

After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I attacked the big workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting with my new friend. I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, so goodnight, and more tomorrow.

Tuesday Eve

Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the children acted like Sancho, and at one time I really thought I should shake them all round. Some good angel inspired me to try gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down and keep still. After luncheon, the girl took them out for a walk, and I went to my needlework like little Mabel “with a willing mind.” I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut, and someone began to hum,





Kennst Du Das Land,





like a big bumblebee. It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn't resist the temptation, and lifting one end of the curtain before the glass door, I peeped in. Professor Bhaer was there, and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at him. A regular German—rather stout, with brown hair tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good, after our sharp or slipshod American gabble. His clothes were rusty, his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome feature in his face, except his beautiful teeth; yet I liked him, for he had a fine head, his linen was very nice, and he looked like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat and there was a patch on one shoe. He looked sober in spite of his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him like an old friend. Then he smiled, and when a tap came at the door, called out in a loud, brisk tone,

“Herein! ”

I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of a child carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going on.

“Me wants my Bhaer, ” said the mite, slamming down her book and running to meet him.

“Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer. Come, then, and take a goot hug from him, my Tina, ” said the Professor, catching her up with a laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him.

“Now me mus tuddy my lessin, ” went on the funny little thing. So he put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary she had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and she scribbled away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing her little fat finger down the page, as if finding a word, so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look that made me think she must be his own, though she looked more French than German.

Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent me back to my work, and there I virtuously remained through all the noise and gabbling that went on next door. One of the girls kept laughing affectedly, and saying “Now Professor, ” in a coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.

Both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once I heard him say emphatically,“No,no,it is not so,you haf not attend to what I say, ” and once there was a loud rap, as if he struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing exclamation, “Prut! It all goes bad this day.”

Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took just one more peep to see if he survived it. He seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and taking little Tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away. I fancy he has a hard life of it. Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five o'clock dinner—and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought I would, just to see what sort of people are under the same roof with me. So I made myself respectable and tried to slip in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as she is short and I'm tall, my efforts at concealment were rather a failure. She gave me a seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage and looked about me. The long table was full, and every one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially,who seemed to be eating on time,for they bolted in every sense of the word, vanishing as soon as they were done. There was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves, young couples absorbed in each other, married ladies in their babies, and old gentlemen in politics. I don't think I shall care to have much to do with any of them, except one sweetfaced maiden lady, who looks as if she had something in her.

Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor, shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive, deaf old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with a Frenchman on the other. If Amy had been here, she'd have turned her back on him forever because, sad to relate, he had a great appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which would have horrified “her ladyship”. I didn't mind, for I like “to see folks eat with a relish, ” as Hannah says, and the poor man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.

As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men were settling their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard one say low to the other,“Who's the new party? ”

“Governess, or something of that sort.”

“What the deuce is she at our table for? ”

“Friend of the old lady's.”

“Handsome head, but no style.”

“Not a bit of it. Give us a light and come on.”

I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess is as good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't style, which is more than some people have, judging from the remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like bad chimneys. I hate ordinary people!

Thursday

Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and writing in my little room, which is very cozy, with a light and fire. I picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the Professor. It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. The little thing has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is very fond of children, though a “bacheldore”. Kitty and Minnie Kirke likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts of stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and the splendid tales he tells. The young men quiz him, it seems, call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner of jokes on his name. But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke says, and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in spite of his foreign ways.

The maiden lady is a Miss Norton—rich, cultivated, and kind. She spoke to me at dinner today (for I went to table again, it's such fun to watch people), and asked me to come and see her at her room. She has fine books and pictures, knows interesting persons, and seems friendly, so I shall make myself agreeable, for I do want to get into good society, only it isn't the same sort that Amy likes.

I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in with some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke. She wasn't there, but Minnie, who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily: “This is Mamma's friend, Miss March.”

“Yes, and she's jolly and we like her lots, ” added Kitty, who is an enfant terrible.

We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.

“Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees Marsch. If so again, call at me and I come, ” he said, with a threatening frown that delighted the little wretches.

I promised I would, and he departed; but it seems as if I was doomed to see a good deal of him, for today as I passed his door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with my umbrella. It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other. He didn't seem at all ashamed of it, for when I explained and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all, saying in his loud, cheerful way—

“You haf a fine day to make your walk.Bon voyage,mademoiselle.”

I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. The German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is another thing and not so pretty.

Saturday

Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss Norton, who has a room full of pretty things, and who was very charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked me if I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts, as her escort, if I enjoyed them. She put it as a favor, but I'm sure Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of kindness to me. I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from such people don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.

When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down on his hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.

“We are playing nargerie, ”explained Kitty.

“Dis is mine effalunt! ” added Tina, holding on by the Professor's hair.

“Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon, when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr. Bhaer? ” said Minnie.

The “effalunt” sat up, looking as much in earnest as any of them, and said soberly to me, “I gif you my wort it is so, if we make too large a noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we go more softly.”

I promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the fun as much as they did—for a more glorious frolic I never witnessed. They played tag and soldiers, danced and sang, and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about the Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the storks on the chimney tops, and the little “kobolds”, who ride the snowflakes as they fall. I wish Americans were as simple and natural as Germans, don't you?

I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if motives of economy didn't stop me; for though I've used thin paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this long letter will need. Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can spare them. My small news will sound very flat after her splendors, but you will like them, I know. Is Teddy studying so hard that he can't find time to write to his friends? Take good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the babies, and give heaps of love to everyone.

From your faithful

Jo

P. S. On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather Bhaery, but I am always interested in odd people, and I really had nothing else to write about. Bless you!





DECEMBER

My Precious Beth,

As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on; for though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful! After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in the way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish. They are not so interesting to me as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty by them, and they are fond of me. Franz and Emil are jolly little lads, quite after my own heart, for the mixture of German and American spirit in them produces a constant state of effervescence. Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether spent in the house or out, for on pleasant days they all go to walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep order, and then such fun!

We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take lessons. I really couldn't help it, and it all came about in such a droll way that I must tell you. To begin at the beginning, Mrs. Kirke called to me one day as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room where she was rummaging.

“Did you ever see such a den, my dear? Just come and help me put these books to rights, for I've turned everything upside down, trying to discover what he has done with the six new handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago.”

I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it was “a den”to be sure. Books and papers everywhere; a broken meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other; half-finished boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts. Dirty little boots stood drying before the fire, and traces of the dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave of himself, were to be seen all over the room. After a grand rummage three of the missing articles were found, one over the bird cage—one covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having been used as a holder.

“Such a man! ” laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the relics in the rag bay. “I suppose the others are torn up to rig ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite tails. It's dreadful, but I can't scold him: he's so absent-minded and good-natured, he lets those boys ride over him roughshod. I agreed to do his washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes.”

“Let me mend them, ” said I. “I don't mind it, and he needn't know. I'd like to, he's so kind to me about bringing my letters and lending books.”

So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two pairs of the socks—for they were boggled out of shape with his queer darns. Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it out, but one day last week he caught me at it. Hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that I took a fancy to learn, for Tina runs in and out, leaving the door open, and I can hear. I had been sitting near this door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am. The girl had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to Tina not to betray him.

“So! ” he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, “you peep at me, I peep at you, and this is not bad; but see, I am not pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German? ”

“Yes, but you are too busy. I am too stupid to learn, ” I blundered out, as red as a peony.

“Prut! We will make the time, and we fail not to find the sense. At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness, for look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay.” And he pointed to my work. “‘Yes, ' they say to one another, these so kind ladies, ‘he is a stupid old fellow, he will see not what we do, he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall, and believe that strings make theirselves.' Ah! But I haf an eye, and I see much. I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this. Come, a little lesson then and now, or—no more good fairy works for me and mine.”

Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it really is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we began. I took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical bog. The Professor was very patient with me, but it must have been torment to him, and now and then he'd look at me with such an expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up with me whether to laugh or cry. I tried both ways, and when it came to a sniff of utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room. I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever, but didn't blame him a particle, and was scrambling my papers together, meaning to rush upstairs and shake myself hard, when in he came, as brisk and beaming as if I'd covered myself in glory.

“Now we shall try a new way. You and I will read these pleasant little Märchen together,and dig no more in that dry book,that goes in the corner for making us trouble.”

He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersen's fairy tales so invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than ever, and went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that seemed to amuse him immensely. I forgot my bashfulness, and pegged away (no other word will express it) with all my might, tumbling over long words, pronouncing according to inspiration of the minute, and doing my very best. When I finished reading my first page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and cried out in his hearty way,“Das ist gut!Now we go well!My turn.I do him in German, gif me your ear.” And away he went, rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which was good to see as well as hear. Fortunately the story was “The Constant Tin Soldier”, which is droll, you know, so I could laugh—and I did—though I didn't understand half he read, for I couldn't help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so comical.

After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons pretty well, for this way of studying suits me, and I can see that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one gives pills in jelly. I like it very much, and he doesn't seem tired of it yet—which is very good of him, isn't it? I mean to give him something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money. Tell me something nice, Marmee.

I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow. You see Beth manages him better than I did. I'm not jealous, dear, do your best, only don't make a saint of him. I'm afraid I couldn't like him without a spice of human naughtiness. Read him bits of my letters. I haven't time to write much, and that will do just as well. Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.





JANUARY





A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of course includes Mr. L. and a young man by the name of Teddy. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle, for I didn't get it till night and had given up hoping. Your letter came in the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was disappointed, for I'd had a “kind of feeling” that you wouldn't forget me. I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after tea, and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was brought to me, I just hugged it and pranced. It was so homey and refreshing that I sat down on the floor and read and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in my usual absurd way. The things were just what I wanted, and all the better for being made instead of bought. Beth's new “ink bib” was capital, and Hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a treasure. I'll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent, Marmee, and read carefully the books Father has marked. Thank you all, heaps and heaps!

Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting rich in that line, for on New Year's Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare. It is one he values much, and I've often admired it, set up in the place of honor with his German Bible, Plato, Homer, and Milton; so you may imagine how I felt when he brought it down, without its cover, and showed me my own name in it, “from my friend Friedrich Bhaer.”

“You say often you wish a library. Here I gif you one, for between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one. Read him well, and he will help you much, for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen.”

I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about “my library”, as if I had a hundred books. I never knew how much there was in Shakespeare before,but then I never had a Bhaer to explain it to me.Now don't laugh at his horrid name. It isn't pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people will say it, but something between the two, as only Germans can give it. I'm glad you both like what I tell you about him,and hope you will know him some day. Mother would admire his warm heart, Father his wise head. I admire both, and feel rich in my new “friend Friedrich Bhaer”.

Not having much money, or knowing what he'd like, I got several little things, and put them about the room, where he would find them unexpectedly. They were useful, pretty, or funny—a new standish on his table, a little vase for his flower—he always has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says—and a holder for his blower, so that he needn't burn up what Amy calls “mouchoirs”. I made it like those Beth invented—a big butterfly with a fat body, and black and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes. It took his fancy immensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue, so it was rather a failure after all. Poor as he is, he didn't forget a servant or a child in the house, and not a soul here, from the French laundrywoman to Miss Norton forgot him. I was so glad of that.

They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's Eve. I didn't mean to go down, having no dress. But at the last minute, Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss Norton lent me lace and feathers. So I dressed up as Mrs. Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask on. No one knew me, for I disguised my voice, and no one dreamed of the silent, haughty Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and cool, most of them, and so I am to whippersnappers) could dance and dress, and burst out into a “nice derangement of epitaphs, like an allegory on the banks of the Nile.” I enjoyed it very much, and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me. I heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I'd been an actress, in fact, he thought he remembered seeing me at one of the minor theaters. Meg will relish that joke. Mr.Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania—a perfect little fairy in his arms. To see them dance was “quite a landscape, ” to use a Teddyism.

I had a very happy New Year, after all; and when I thought it over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in spite of my many failures;for I'm cheerful all the time now, work with a will, and take more interest in other people than I used to, which is satisfactory. Bless you all! Ever your loving—

Jo





CHAPTER 34

A FRIEND


THOUGH VERY HAPPY in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort, Jo still found time for literary labors. The purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one to a poor and ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain her end were not the best. She saw that money conferred power: money and power, therefore, she resolved to have, not to be used for herself alone, but for those whom she loved more than self.

The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth everything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years Jo's most cherished castle in the air.

The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after long traveling and much uphill work,lead to this delightful château en Espagne. But the novel disaster quenched her courage for a time, for public opinion is a giant which has frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers. Like that immortal hero, she reposed awhile after the first attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the giant's treasures, if I remember rightly. But the “up again and take another”spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty, but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags.

She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark ages, even all-perfect America read rubbish. She told no one, but concocted a “thrilling tale”,and boldly carried it herself to Mr.Dashwood,editor of the Weekly Volcano. She had never read Sartor Resartus, but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. So she dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself that she was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly room, a cloud of cigar smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen, sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats, which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove on her appearance. Somewhat daunted by this reception, Jo hesitated on the threshold, murmuring in much embarrassment—

“Excuse me,I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office.I wished to see Mr. Dashwood.”

Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest gentleman, and carefully cherishing his cigar between his fingers, he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive of nothing but sleep. Feeling that she must get through the matter somehow, Jo produced her manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence, blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion.

“A friend of mine desired me to offer—a story—just as an experiment—would like your opinion—be glad to write more if this suits.”

While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken the manuscript, and was turning over the leaves with a pair of rather dirty fingers, and casting critical glances up and down the neat pages.

“Not a first attempt, I take it? ” observing that the pages were numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon—sure sign of a novice.

“No, sir. She has had some experience, and got a prize for a tale in the Blarneystone Banner.”

“Oh, did she? ” And Mr. Dashwood gave Jo a quick look, which seemed to take note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots. “Well, you can leave it, if you like. We've more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present, but I'll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week.”

Now,Jo did not like to leave it,for Mr.Dashwood didn't suit her at all; but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away, looking particularly tall and dignified, as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of “my friend” was considered a good joke; and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as he closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long for next week.

When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she rejoiced. Mr. Dashwood was much wider awake than before, which was agreeable;and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners: so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first.

“We'll take this (editors never say I), if you don't object to a few alterations. It's too long, but omitting the passages I've marked will make it just the right length, ” he said, in a businesslike tone.

Jo hardly knew her own MS. again, so crumpled and underscored were its pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender parent might on being asked to cut off her baby's legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle, she looked at the marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral reflections—which she had carefully put in as ballast for much romance—had been stricken out.

“But, sir, I thought every story should have some sort of a moral, so I took care to have a few of my sinners repent.”

Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for Jo had forgotten her “friend”, and spoken as only an author could.

“People want to be amused, not preached at, you know. Morals don't sell nowadays.” Which was not quite a correct statement, by the way.

“You think it would do with these alterations, then? ”

“Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up—language good, and so on, ” was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.

“What do you—that is, what compensation—” began Jo, not exactly knowing how to express herself.

“Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for things of this sort. Pay when it comes out, ” returned Mr. Dashwood, as if that point had escaped him. Such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said.

“Very well, you can have it, ” said Jo, handing back the story with a satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five seemed good pay.

“Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this? ” asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and emboldened by her success.

“Well, we'll look at it. Can't promise to take it. Tell her to make it short and spicy, and never mind the moral. What name would your friend like to put on it? ” in a careless tone.

“None at all, if you please, she doesn't wish her name to appear and has no nom de plume, ” said Jo, blushing in spite of herself.

“Just as she likes, of course. The tale will be out next week. Will you call for the money, or shall I send it? ” asked Mr. Dashwood, who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.

“I'll call. Good morning, sir.”

As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful remark, “Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do.”

Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury her model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend, she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.

Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and scenery; and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected. Her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely left him in the lurch.

She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew stout, and the little hoard she was making to take Beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. One thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at home. She had a feeling that Father and Mother would not approve, and preferred to have her own way first, and beg pardon afterward. It was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories; Mr. Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.

She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed, and quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over her well-kept secret.

But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls of the readers, history and romance, land and sea, science and art, police records and lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked for the purpose. Jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents, incidents, and crimes. She excited the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on poisons. She studied faces in the street, and characters, good, bad, and indifferent, all about her. She delved in the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin, and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed. She thought she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a woman's character. She was living in bad society, and imaginary though it was, its influence affected her, for she was feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food, and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life, which comes soon enough to all of us.

She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much describing of other people's passions and feelings set her to studying and speculating about her own, a morbid amusement in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge. Wrongdoing always brings its own punishment, and when Jo most needed hers, she got it.

I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her to read character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what was honest, brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary heroes with every perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering a live hero, who interested her in spite of many human imperfections. Mr. Bhaer, in one of their conversations, had advised her to study simple, true, and lovely characters, wherever she found them, as good training for a writer. Jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and studied him—a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for the worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.

Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first. He was neither rich nor great, young nor handsome; in no respect what is called fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet he was as attractive as a genial fire, and people seemed to gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth. He was poor, yet always appeared to be giving something away;a stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer young, but as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven for his sake. Jo often watched him, trying to discover the charm, and at last decided that it was benevolence which worked the miracle. If he had any sorrow, “it sat with its head under its wing, ” and he turned only his sunny side to the world. There were lines upon his forehead, but Time seemed to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to others. The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials of many friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never cold or hard, and his big hand had a warm, strong grasp that was more expressive than words.

His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature of the wearer. They looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him comfortable; his capacious waistcoat was suggestive of a large heart underneath. His rusty coat had a social air, and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands often went in empty and came out full. His very boots were benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy like other people's.

“That's it! ” said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward one's fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.

Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most feminine respect for intellect, and a little discovery which she made about the Professor added much to her regard for him. He never spoke of himself, and no one ever knew that in his native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for learning and integrity, till a countryman came to see him, and in a conversation with Miss Norton divulged the pleasing fact. From her Jo learned it, and liked it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told it. She felt proud to know that he was an honored Professor in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in America, and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the spice of romance which this discovery gave it.

Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in a most unexpected manner. Miss Norton had the entree into most society, which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but for her. The solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious girl, and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo and the Professor. She took them with her one night to a select symposium, held in honor of several celebrities.

Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off. But her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night, and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that the great creatures were only men and women after all. Imagine her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on“spirit, fire, and dew, ” to behold him devouring his supper with an ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance. Turning as from a fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions. The great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with one of the Madame de Staëls of the age, who looked daggers at another Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible. The scientific celebrities, forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about art, while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with characteristic energy; the young musician, who was charming the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen of the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary man of the party.

Before the evening was half over,Jo felt so completely désillusionnée, that she sat down in a corner to recover herself. Mr. Bhaer soon joined her, looking rather out of his element, and presently several of the philosophers, each mounted on his hobby, came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in the recess. The conversations were miles beyond Jo's comprehension, but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were unknown gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms, and the only thing“evolved from her inner consciousness” was a bad headache after it was all over. It dawned upon her gradually that the world was being picked to pieces, and put together on new and, according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles than before, that religion was in a fair way to be reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be the only God. Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.

She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and found him looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear. He shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs.

Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his own opinions, not because they were unsettled, but too sincere and earnest to be lightly spoken. As he glanced from Jo to several other young people, attracted by the brilliancy of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his brows and longed to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul would be led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.

He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed to for an opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and defended religion with all the eloquence of truth—an eloquence which made his broken English musical and his plain face beautiful. He had a hard fight, for the wise men argued well, but he didn't know when he was beaten and stood to his colors like a man. Somehow, as he talked, the world got right again to Jo. The old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed better than the new. God was not a blind force, and immortality was not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact. She felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again, and when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but not one whit convinced, Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.

She did neither; but she remembered the scene, and gave the Professor her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him an effort to speak out then and there, because his conscience would not let him be silent. She began to see that character is a better possession than money, rank, intellect, or beauty, and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined it to be,“truth, reverence, and good will, ” then her friend Friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.

This belief strengthened daily. She valued his esteem, she coveted his respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything. It all grew out of a cocked hat, for one evening the Professor came in to give Jo her lesson with a paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put there and he had forgotten to take off.

“It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming down, ”thought Jo, with a smile, as he said “Goot efening, ” and sat soberly down, quite unconscious of the ludicrous contrast between his subject and his headgear,for he was going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.

She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh out his big, hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she left him to discover it for himself, and presently forgot all about it, for to hear a German read Schiller is rather an absorbing occupation. After the reading came the lesson, which was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night, and the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment. The Professor didn't know what to make of her, and stopped at last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible—

“Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face? Haf you no respect for me, that you go on so bad? ”

“How can I be respectful, sir, when you forget to take your hat off? ”said Jo.

Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol.

“Ah! I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a fool with my cap. Well, it is nothing; but see you, if this lesson goes not well, you too shall wear him.”

But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because Mr. Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it, said with great disgust,“I wish these papers did not come in the house. They are not for children to see, nor young people to read. It is not well, and I haf no patience with those who make this harm.”

Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration composed of a lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like it, but the impulse that made her turn it over was not one of displeasure but fear, because for a minute she fancied the paper was the Volcano.It was not,however,and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have been no name to betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it troubled him. He did not say to himself, “It is none of my business. I've no right to say anything, ” as many people would have done. He only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready to say quite naturally, but very gravely—

“Yes, you are right to put it from you. I do not think that good young girls should see such things. They are made pleasant to some, but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder to play with than this bad trash.”

“All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for it, I don't see any harm in supplying it. Many very respectable people make an honest living out of what are called sensation stories, ” said Jo, scratching gathers so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin.

“There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do not care to sell it. If the respectable people knew what harm they did, they would not feel that the living was honest.They haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum, and let the small ones eat it. No, they should think a little, and sweep mud in the street before they do this thing.”

Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling the paper in his hands. Jo sat still, looking as if the fire had come to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney.

“I should like much to send all the rest after him, ” muttered the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.

Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would make, and her hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience at that minute. Then she thought consolingly to herself, “Mine are not like that, they are only silly, never bad, so I won't be worried, ” and taking up her book, she said, with a studious face, “Shall we go on, sir? I'll be very good and proper now.”

“I shall hope so, ” was all he said, but he meant more than she imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her feel as if the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large type on her forehead.

As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers, and carefully reread every one of her stories. Being a little shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eyeglasses, and Jo had tried them once, smiling to see how they magnified the fine print of her book. Now she seemed to have on the Professor's mental or moral spectacles also, for the faults of these poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay.

“They are trash,and will soon be worse trash if I go on,for each is more sensational than the last. I've gone blindly on, hurting myself and other people, for the sake of money. I know it's so, for I can't read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it,and what should I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them? ”

Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.

“Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense. I'd better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder, ”she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes.

But when nothing remained of all her three months' work except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked sober, as she sat on the floor, wondering what she ought to do about her wages.

“I think I haven't done much harm yet,and may keep this to pay for my time, ” she said, after a long meditation, adding impatiently, “I almost wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so inconvenient. If I didn't care about doing right, and didn't feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I should get on capitally. I can't help wishing sometimes, that Mother and Father hadn't been so particular about such things.”

Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that “Father and Mother were particular, ”and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood.

Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of Mrs. Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah More, and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral was it. She had her doubts about it from the beginning, for her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff and cumbrous costume of the last century. She sent this didactic gem to several markets, but it found no purchaser, and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals didn't sell.

Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it. The only person who offered enough to make it worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his particular belief. But much as she liked to write for children, Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues. So nothing came of these trials, and Jo corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility—

“I don't know anything; I'll wait until I do before I try again, and meantime, ‘sweep mud in the street' if I can't do better; that's honest, at least; ” which decision proved that her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good.

While these internal revolutions were going on, her external life had been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed it but Professor Bhaer. He did it so quietly that Jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she had given up writing. Not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant.

He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend, and Jo was happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning other lessons besides German, and laying a foundation for the sensation story of her own life.

It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not leave Mrs. Kirke till June. Everyone seemed sorry when the time came. The children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair stuck straight up all over his head, for he always rumpled it wildly when disturbed in mind.

“Going home? Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go in, ” he said, when she told him, and sat silently pulling his beard in the corner, while she held a little levee on that last evening.

She was going early, so she bade them all good-by overnight; and when his turn came, she said warmly, “Now, sir, you won't forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our way, will you? I'll never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to know my friend.”

“Do you? Shall I come? ” he asked, looking down at her with an eager expression which she did not see.

“Yes, come next month. Laurie graduates then, and you'd enjoy commencement as something new.”

“That is your best friend, of whom you speak? ” he said in an altered tone.

“Yes, my boy Teddy. I'm very proud of him and should like you to see him.”

Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another. Something in Mr. Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that she might find Laurie more than a “best friend”, and simply because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was the matter, she involuntarily began to blush, and the more she tried not to, the redder she grew. If it had not been for Tina on her knee. She didn't know what would have become of her. Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to hide her face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it. But he did, and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety to its usual expression,as he said cordially—

“I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend much success,and you all happiness.Gott bless you! ”And with that,he shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.

But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire with the tired look on his face and the“heimweh”,or homesickness,lying heavy at his heart. Once, when he remembered Jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new softness in her face, he leaned his head on his hands a minute, and then roamed about the room, as if in search of something that he could not find.

“It is not for me, I must not hope it now, ” he said to himself, with a sigh that was almost a groan. Then, as if reproaching himself for the longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened his Plato.

He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found that a pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato, were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.

Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see Jo off, and thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a bunch of violets to keep her company, and best of all, the happy thought, “Well, the winter's gone, and I've written no books, earned no fortune, but I've made a friend worth having and I'll try to keep him all my life.”





CHAPTER 35

HEARTACHE


WHATEVER HIS MOTIVE might have been, Laurie studied to some purpose that year, for he graduated with honor, and gave the Latin oration with the grace of a Phillips and the eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his friends said. They were all there, his grandfather—oh, so proud! —Mr. and Mrs. March, John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.

“I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall be home early tomorrow. You'll come and meet me as usual, girls? ” Laurie said, as he put the sisters into the carriage after the joys of the day were over. He said “girls”, but he meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up the old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful boy anything, and answered warmly—

“I'll come,Teddy,rain or shine,and march before you,playing‘Hail the conquering hero comes, 'on a jew's-harp.”

Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a sudden panic,“Oh, deary me! I know he'll say something, and then what shall I do? ”

Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her fears, and having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough to think people were going to propose when she had given them every reason to know what her answer would be, she set forth at the appointed time, hoping Teddy wouldn't do anything to make her hurt his poor feelings. A call at Meg's, and a refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still further fortified her for the tête-à-tête, but when she saw a stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong desire to turn about and run away.

“Where's the jew's-harp, Jo? ” cried Laurie, as soon as he was within speaking distance.

“I forgot it.” And Jo took heart again, for that salutation could not be called loverlike.

She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now she did not, and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign, but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects, till they turned from the road into the little path that led homeward through the grove. Then he walked more slowly, suddenly lost his fine flow of language, and now and then a dreadful pause occurred. To rescue the conversation from one of the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said hastily, “Now you must have a good long holiday! ”

“I intend to.”

Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, “No, Teddy. Please don't! ”

“I will,and you must hear me.It's no use,Jo,we've got to have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us, ” he answered, getting flushed and excited all at once.

“Say what you like then. I'll listen, ” said Jo, with a desperate sort of patience.

Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant to “have it out, ” if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into the subject with characteristic impetuousity,saying in a voice that would get choky now and then, in spite of manful efforts to keep it steady—

“I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help it, you've been so good to me. I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me. Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer, for I can't go on so any longer.”

“I wanted to save you this. I thought you'd understand—” began Jo, finding it a great deal harder than she expected.

“I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they mean. They say no when they mean yes, and drive a man out of his wits just for the fun of it, ” returned Laurie, entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact.

“I don't. I never wanted to make you care for me so, and I went away to keep you from it if I could.”

“I thought so. It was like you, but it was no use. I only loved you all the more, and I worked hard to please you, and I gave up billiards and everything you didn't like, and waited and never complained, for I hoped you'd love me, though I'm not half good enough.” Here there was a choke that couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while he cleared his “confounded throat”.

“You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and I'm so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't know why I can't love you as you want me to. I've tried, but I can't change the feeling, and it would be a lie to say I do when I don't.”

“Really, truly, Jo? ”

He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put his question with a look that she did not soon forget.

“Really, truly, dear.”

They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when the last words fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped her hands and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life the fence was too much for him. So he just laid his head down on the mossy post, and stood so still that Jo was frightened.

“Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill myself if it would do any good! I wish you wouldn't take it so hard, I can't help it. You know it's impossible for people to make themselves love other people if they don't, ” cried Jo inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly patted his shoulder, remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago.

“They do sometimes, ” said a muffled voice from the post.

“I don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd rather not try it” was the decided answer.

There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. Presently Jo said very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, “Laurie, I want to tell you something.”

He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in a fierce tone,“Don't tell me that,Jo,I can't bear it now! ”

“Tell what? ” she asked, wondering at his violence.

“That you love that old man.”

“What old man? ” demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather.

“That devilish Professor you were always writing about. If you say you love him, I know I shall do something desperate.” And he looked as if he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes.

Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly, for she, too, was getting excited with all this, “Don't swear, Teddy! He isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and the best friend I've got, next to you. Pray, don't fly into a passion. I want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if you abuse my Professor. I haven't the least idea of loving him or anybody else.”

“But you will after a while, and then what will become of me? ”

“You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and forget all this trouble.”

“I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo, Never! Never! ”with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.

“What shall I do with him? ” sighed Jo, finding that emotions were more unmanagable than she expected. “You haven't heard what I wanted to tell you. Sit down and listen, for indeed I want to do right and make you happy, ” she said, hoping to soothe him with a little reason, which proved that she knew nothing about love.

Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face. Now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear thought on Jo's part,for how could she say hard things to her boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing, and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him? She gently turned his head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake—how touching that was, to be sure! —

“I agree with Mother that you and I are not suited to each other, because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we were so foolish as to—” Jo paused a little over the last word, but Laurie uttered it with a rapturous expression.

“Marry—no, we shouldn't! If you loved me, Jo, I should be a perfect saint, for you could make me anything you like.”

“No, I can't. I've tried and failed, and I won't risk our happiness by such a serious experiment. We don't agree and we never shall, so we'll be good friends all our lives, but we won't go and do anything rash.”

“Yes, we will if we get the chance, ” muttered Laurie rebelliously.

“Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case, ”implored Jo, almost at her wit's end.

“I won't be reasonable. I don't want to take what you call ‘a sensible view'. It won't help me, and it only makes it harder. I don't believe you've got any heart.”

“I wish I hadn't.”

There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and, thinking it a good omen, Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive powers to bear as he said, in the wheedlesome tone that had never been so dangerously wheedlesome before, “Don't disappoint us, dear! Everyone expects it. Grandpa has set his heart upon it, your people like it, and I can't get on without you. Say you will, and let's be happy. Do, do! ”

Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had made when she decided that she did not love her boy, and never could. It was very hard to do, but she did it, knowing that delay was both useless and cruel.

“I can't say ‘yes' truly, so I won't say it at all. You'll see that I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it—” she began solemnly.

“I'll be hanged if I do! ” And Laurie bounced up off the grass, burning with indignation at the very idea.

“Yes, you will! ” persisted Jo. “You'll get over this after a while, and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house. I shouldn't. I'm homely and awkward and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel—we can't help it even now, you see—and I shouldn't like elegant society and you would, and you'd hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and everything would be horrid! ”

“Anything more? ” asked Laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst.

“Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever marry. I'm happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man.”

“I know better! ” broke in Laurie. “You think so now, but there'll come a time when you will care for somebody,and you'll love him tremendously, and live and die for him. I know you will, it's your way, and I shall have to stand by and see it.” And the despairing lover cast his hat upon the ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical, if his face had not been so tragic.

“Yes,I will live and die for him,if he ever comes and makes me love him in spite of myself, and you must do the best you can! ” cried Jo, losing patience with poor Teddy.“I've done my best,but you won't be reasonable, and it's selfish of you to keep teasing for what I can't give. I shall always be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but I'll never marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for both of us—so now! ”

That speech was like gunpowder. Laurie looked at her a minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself, then turned sharply away, saying in a desperate sort of tone, “You'll be sorry some day, Jo.”

“Oh, where are you going? ” she cried, for his face frightened her.

“To the devil! ” was the consoling answer.

For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself down the bank toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin or misery to send a young man to a violent death, and Laurie was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single failure. He had no thought of a melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time up the river than he had done in any race. Jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart.

“That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a tender, penitent state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him, ” she said, adding, as she went slowly home, feeling as if she had murdered some innocent thing, and buried it under the leaves. “Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very kind to my poor boy. I wish he'd love Beth, perhaps he may in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her. Oh dear! How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them? I think it's dreadful.”

Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely through, and then broke down, crying so dismally over her own insensibility that the kind old gentleman, though sorely disappointed, did not utter a reproach. He found it difficult to understand how any girl could help loving Laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his boy out of harm's way, for Young Impetuosity's parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.

When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his grandfather met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the delusion very successfully for an hour or two. But when they sat together in the twilight, the time they used to enjoy so much, it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual, and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of the last year's success, which to him now seemed like love's labor lost. He bore it as long as he could, then went to his piano and began to play. The windows were open, and Jo, walking in the garden with Beth, for once understood music better than her sister, for he played the “Sonata Pathétique”, and played it as he never did before.

“That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make one cry. Give us something gayer, lad, ” said Mr. Laurence, whose kind old heart was full of sympathy, which he longed to show but knew not how.

Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling, “Jo, dear, come in. I want you.”

Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning! As he listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken chord, and the musician sat silent in the dark.

“I can't stand this, ” muttered the old gentleman. Up he got, groped his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either of the broad shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, “I know, my boy, I know.”

No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, “Who told you? ”

“Jo herself.”

“Then there's an end of it! ” And he shook off his grandfather's hands with an impatient motion, for though grateful for the sympathy, his man's pride could not bear a man's pity.

“Not quite. I want to say one thing, and then there shall be an end of it, ” returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness. “You won't care to stay at home now, perhaps? ”

“I don't intend to run away from a girl. Jo can't prevent my seeing her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like, ” interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone.

“Not if you are the gentleman I think you. I'm disappointed, but the girl can't help it, and the only thing left for you to do is to go away for a time. Where will you go? ”

“Anywhere. I don't care what becomes of me.” And Laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's ear.

“Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's sake. Why not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it? ”

“I can't.”

“But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should when you got through college.”

“Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone! ” And Laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see.

“I don't ask you to go alone. There's someone ready and glad to go with you, anywhere in the world.”

“Who, sir? ” stopping to listen.

“Myself.”

Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his hand, saying huskily, “I'm a selfish brute, but—you know—Grandfather—”

“Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all before, once in my own young days, and then with your father. Now, my dear boy, just sit quietly down and hear my plan. It's all settled, and can be carried out at once, ” said Mr. Laurence, keeping hold of the young man, as if fearful that he would break away as his father had done before him.

“Well, sir, what is it? ” and Laurie sat down, without a sign of interest in face or voice.

“There is business in London that needs looking after. I meant you should attend to it, but I can do it better myself, and things here will get on very well with Brooke to manage them. My partners do almost everything, I'm merely holding on until you take my place, and can be off at any time.”

“But you hate traveling, sir. I can't ask it of you at your age, ” began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice, but much preferred to go alone, if he went at all.

The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly desired to prevent it, for the mood in which he found his grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to his own devices. So, stifling a natural regret at the thought of the home comforts he would leave behind him, he said stoutly, “Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated yet. I quite enjoy the idea. It will do me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair.”

A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair was not easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily,“I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden. I go because I think you'd feel happier than if I was left behind. I don't intend to gad about with you, but leave you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my own way. I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to visit them. Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland, where you will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery, and adventures to your heart's content.”

Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness. He sighed, and then said, in a spiritless tone, “Just as you like, sir. It doesn't matter where I go or what I do.”

“It does to me, remember that, my lad. I give you entire liberty, but I trust you to make an honest use of it. Promise me that, Laurie.”

“Anything you like, sir.”

“Good, ” thought the old gentleman. “You don't care now, but there'll come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or I'm much mistaken.”

Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while the iron was hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit enough to rebel, they were off. During the time necessary for preparation, Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do in such cases. He was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns; lost his appetite, neglected his dress and devoted much time to playing tempestuously on his piano; avoided Jo, but consoled himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragic face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a heavy sense of guilt by day. Unlike some sufferers, he never spoke of his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer sympathy. On some accounts, this was a relief to his friends, but the weeks before his departure were very uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced that the “poor, dear fellow was going away to forget his trouble, and come home happy.” Of course, he smiled darkly at their delusion, but passed it by with the sad superiority of one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable.

When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert themselves. This gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did for his sake, and he got on very well till Mrs. March kissed him, with a whisper full of motherly solicitude. Then feeling that he was going very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the afflicted Hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life. Jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. He did look round, came back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him, and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent and pathetic.

“Oh, Jo, can't you? ”

“Teddy, dear, I wish I could! ”

That was all, except a little pause. Then Laurie straightened himself up, said, “It's all right, never mind, ” and went away without another word. Ah,but it wasn't all right,and Jo did mind,for while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer, she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when he left her without a look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never would come again.





CHAPTER 36

BETH'S SECRET


WHEN JO CAME HOME that spring, she had been struck with the change in Beth. No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it, for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily, but to eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she saw her sister's face. It was no paler and but little thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. Jo saw and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no one appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in other cares Jo for a time forgot her fear.

But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the vague anxiety returned and haunted her. She had confessed her sins and been forgiven, but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip, Beth had thanked her heartily, but begged not to go so far away from home. Another little visit to the seashore would suit her better, and as Grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the open air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks.

It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another. Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too wrapped up in her to care for anyone else. So they were all in all to each other, and came and went, quite unconscious of the interest they exited in those about them, who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one, always together, as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away.

They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome. Jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and Beth's, but when she put out her hand to lift it up, there seemed something sacred in the silence, and she waited for Beth to speak. She wondered, and was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see what she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better. She wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet.

One day Beth told her. Jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still, and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on Beth's cheeks. But she could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been gathering. It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they cleared, Beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say, “Jo, dear, I'm glad you know it. I've tried to tell you, but I couldn't.”

There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her own, not even tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not cry. She was the weaker then, and Beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear.

“I've known it for a good while, dear, and, now I'm used to it, it isn't hard to think of or to bear. Try to see it so and don't be troubled about me, because it's best, indeed it is.”

“Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You did not feel it then, and keep it to yourself so long, did you? ” asked Jo, refusing to see or say that it was best,but glad to know that Laurie had no part in Beth's trouble.

“Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it. I tried to think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it trouble anyone. But when I saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans, it was hard to feel that I could never be like you, and then I was miserable, Jo.”

“Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and help you! How could you shut me out, bear it all alone? ”

Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while Beth learned to say good-by to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully.

“Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right. I wasn't sure, no one said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken. It would have been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie—at least I thought so then.”

“And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because I couldn't, ” cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.

Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite of her pain, and added softly, “Then you didn't, deary? I was afraid it was so, and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while.”

“Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you? ” asked Beth, as innocently as a child. “I do love him dearly. He is so good to me, how can I help it? But he could never be anything to me but my brother. I hope he truly will be, sometime.”

“Not through me, ” said Jo decidedly. “Amy is left for him, and they would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such things, now. I don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth. You must get well.”

“I want to, oh, so much! I try, but every day I lose a little, and feel more sure that I shall never gain it back. It's like the tide, Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped.”

“It shall be stopped,your tide must not turn so soon,nineteen is too young, Beth. I can't let you go. I'll work and pray and fight against it. I'll keep you in spite of everything. There must be ways, it can't be too late. God won't be so cruel as to take you from me, ” cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was far less piously submissive than Beth's.

Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety. It shows itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence than homilies or protestations. Beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life, and cheerfully wait for death. Like a confiding child, she asked no questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father and Mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and they only, could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come. She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love, from which our Father never means us to be weaned, but through which He draws us closer to Himself. She could not say, “I'm glad to go, ” for life was very sweet for her. She could only sob out, “I try to be willing, ” while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together.

By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, “You'll tell them this when we go home? ”

“I think they will see it without words, ” sighed Jo, for now it seemed to her that Beth changed every day.

“Perhaps not. I've heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things. If they don't see it, you will tell them for me. I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare them. Meg has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must stand by Father and Mother, won't you, Jo? ”

“If I can. But, Beth, I don't give up yet. I'm going to believe that it is a sick fancy,and not let you think it's true.”said Jo,trying to speak cheerfully.

Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, “I don't know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone but you, because I can't speak out except to my Jo. I only mean to say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should live long. I'm not like the rest of you. I never made any plans about what I'd do when I grew up; I never thought of being married, as you all did. I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little Beth, trotting about at home, of no use anywhere but there. I never wanted to go away, and the hard part now is the leaving you all. I'm not afraid, but it seems as if I should be homesick for you even in heaven.”

Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide. A white-winged gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast; Beth watched it till it vanished, and her eyes were full of sadness. A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach, “peeping” softly to itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea. It came quite close to Beth, and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone, dressing its wet feathers, quite at home. Beth smiled and felt comforted, for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.

“Dear little bird! See, Jo, how tame it is. I like peeps better than the gulls. They are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy, confiding little things. I used to call them my birds last summer, and Mother said they reminded her of me—busy, quaker-colored creatures, always near the shore, and always chirping that contented little song of theirs. You are the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the wind, flying far out to sea, and happy all alone. Meg is the turtledove, and Amy is like the lark she writes about, trying to get up among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest again. Dear little girl! She's so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home. I hope I shall see her again, but she seems so far away.”

“She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her. I'm going to have you well and rosy by that time, ”began Jo, feeling that of all the changes in Beth, the talking change was the greatest, for it seemed to cost no effort now, and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful Beth.

“Jo, dear, don't hope any more. It won't do any good. I'm sure of that. We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait. We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much, and I think the tide will go out easily, if you help me.”

Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that silent kiss, she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.

She was right: there was no need of any words when they got home, for Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing. Tired with her short journey, Beth went at once to bed, saying how glad she was to be home, and when Jo went down, she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling Beth's secret. Her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece, and did not turn as she came in; but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo went to comfort her without a word.





CHAPTER 37

NEW IMPRESSIONS


AT THREE o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais—a charming place, for the wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills. Many nations are represented, many languages spoken, many costumes worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival. Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans, handsome Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans, all drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticizing the latest celebrity who has arrived—Ristori or Dickens, Victor Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands. The equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch behind.

Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked slowly, with his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance. He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the independent air of an American—a combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy him his inches. There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the young man took little notice of them, except to glance now and then at some blonde girl in blue. Presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the beach toward Castle Hill. The quick trot of ponies' feet made him look up, as one of the little carriages, containing a single young lady, came rapidly down the street. The lady was young, blonde, and dressed in blue. He stared a minute, then his whole face woke up, and, waving his hat like a boy, he hurried forward to meet her.

“Oh, Laurie, is it really you? I thought you'd never come! ” cried Amy, dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the great scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's steps, lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these “mad English”.

“I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas with you, and here I am.”

“How is your grandfather? When did you come? Where are you staying? ”

“Very well—last night—at the Chauvain. I called at your hotel, but you were out.”

“I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin! Get in and we can talk at our ease. I was going for a drive and longing for company. Flo's saving up for tonight.”

“What happens then, a ball? ”

“A Christmas party at our hotel. There are many Americans there, and they give it in honor of the day. You'll go with us, of course? Aunt will be charmed.”

“Thank you. Where now? ” asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs afforded her infinite satisfaction.

“I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to Castle Hill. The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks. Have you ever been there? ”

“Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it.”

“Now tell me all about yourself. The last I heard of you, your grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin.”

“Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris, where he has settled for the winter. He has friends there and finds plenty to amuse him, so I go and come, and we get on capitally.”

“That's a sociable arrangement, ” said Amy, missing something in Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what.

“Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still, so we each suit ourselves, and there is no trouble. I am often with him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that someone is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings. Dirty old hole, isn't it? ” he added, with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city.

“The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind. The river and the hills are delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my delight. Now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass. It's going to the Church of St. John.”

While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside her. He was handsomer than ever and greatly improved, she thought, but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over, he looked tired and spiritless—not sick, nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him. She couldn't understand it and did not venture to ask questions, so she shook her head and touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.

“Que pensez-vous? ”she said,airing her French,which had improved in quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.

“That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the result is charming, ” replied Laurie, bowing, with his hand on his heart and an admiring look.

She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home, when he promenaded round her on festival occasions, and told her she was“altogether jolly, ” with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head. She didn't like the new tone, for though not blasé, it sounded indifferent in spite of the look.

“If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he'd stay a boy, ” she thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay.

At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June.

“Beth is very poorly, Mother says. I often think I ought to go home, but they all say ‘stay.' So I do, for I shall never have another chance like this, ” said Amy, looking sober over one page.

“I think you are right, there; you could do nothing at home, and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy, and enjoying so much, my dear.”

He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as he said that; and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart was lightened, for the look, the act, the brotherly “my dear”, seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come, she would not be alone in a strange land. Presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, “Genius burns! ”.

Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket “to keep it from blowing away, ” and listened with interest to the lively letter Amy read him.

“This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents in the morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at night, ” said Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort, and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely waiting to be fed. While Amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her as she had looked at him, with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought. He found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance. Always mature for her age, she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation, which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was, but her old petulance now and then showed itself, her strong will still held its own, and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign polish.

Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks, but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried away a pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the sunshine, which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh color of her cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene.

As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill, Amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and said, pointing here and there, “Do you remember the Cathedral and the Corso, the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and, best of all, that speck far out to sea which they say is Corsica? ”

“I remember. It's not much changed, ” he answered without enthusiasm.

“What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck! ” said Amy, feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.

“Yes, ” was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made interesting in his sight.

“Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while, ” said Amy, seating herself, ready for a good talk.

But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved about the Continent and been to Greece. So after idling away an hour, they drove home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs. Carrol, Laurie left them, promising to return in the evening.

It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that night. Time and absence had done its work on both the young people. She had seen her old friend in a new light, not as “our boy”, but as a handsome and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight. Amy knew her good points, and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman.

Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion of simple dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were both inexpensive and effective. It must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged in antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies. But, dear heart, we all have our little weaknesses, and find it easy to pardon such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness, and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities.

“I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home, ” said Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball dress, and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect. Her hair she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.

“It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to make a fright of myself, ” she used to say, when advised to frizzle, puff, or braid, as the latest style commanded.

Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines. Remembering the painted boots, she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and chasséd down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself.

“My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm, and the real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress.If I only had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy, ” she said, surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand.

In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away. She seldom ran—it did not suit her style, she thought, for, being tall, the stately and Junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante. She walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged herself under the chandelier, which had a good effect upon her hair, then she thought better of it, and went away to the other end of the room, as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one. It so happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress, the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a well-placed statue.

“Good evening, Diana! ” said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.

“Good evening, Apollo! ” she answered, smiling back at him, for he, too, looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused Amy to pity the four plain Misses Davis from the bottom of her heart.

“Here are your flowers. I arranged them myself, remembering that you didn't like what Hannah calls a ‘sot-bookay', ” said Laurie, handing her a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in Cardiglia's window.

“How kind you are! ” she exclaimed gratefully. “If I'd known you were coming I'd have had something ready for you today, though not as pretty as this, I'm afraid.”

“Thank you. It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it, ” he added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.

“Please don't.”

“I thought you liked that sort of thing? ”

“Not from you, it doesn't sound natural, and I like your old bluntness better.”

“I'm glad of it, ” he answered, with a look of relief, then buttoned her gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight, just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home.

The company assembled in the long salle à manger that evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent. The hospitable Americans had invited every acquaintance they had in Nice, and having no prejudice against titles, secured a few to add luster to their Christmas ball.

A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin. A Polish count, aged eighteen, devoted himself to the ladies, who pronounced him, “a fascinating dear, ” and a German Serene Something, having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely about, seeking what he might devour. Baron Rothschild's private secretary, a large-nosed Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the world, as if his master's name crowned him with a golden halo. A stout Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for dancing, and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene with her little family of eight. Of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking English ditto, and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles, likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters.

Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she “took the stage” that night, leaning on Laurie's arm. She knew she looked well, she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. She did pity the Davis girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort, except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed, which was good of her, as it permitted them to see her dress, and burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking friend might be. With the first burst of the band, Amy's color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to know it: therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone, “Do you care to dance? ”

“One usually does at a ball.”

Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair his error as fast as possible.

“I meant the first dance. May I have the honor? ”

“I can give you one if I put off the Count. He dances devinely, but he will excuse me, as you are an old friend, ” said Amy, hoping that the name would have a good effect, and show Laurie that she was not to be trifled with.

“Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support





A daughter of the gods,

Devinely tall, and most devinely fair, ”





was all the satisfaction she got, however.

The set in which they found themselves was composed of English, and Amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion, feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with a relish. Laurie resigned her to the “nice little boy”, and went to do his duty to Flo, without securing Amy for the joys to come, which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself till supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence. She showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a glorious polka redowa. But his polite regrets didn't impose upon her, and when she galloped away with the Count, she saw Laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief.

That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him for a long while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moment's rest. Her anger had a good effect, however, for she hid it under a smiling face, and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant. Laurie's eyes followed her with pleasure, for she neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit and grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be. He very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view, and before the evening was half over, had decided that “little Amy was going to make a very charming woman.”

It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made all faces shine, hearts happy, and heels light. The musicians fiddled, tooted, and banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody danced who could, and those who couldn't admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth. The air was dark with Davises, and many Joneses gamboled like a flock of young giraffes. The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing Frenchwoman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train. The serene Teuton found the supper table and was happy, eating steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the garçons by the ravages he committed. But the Emperor's friend covered himself with glory, for he danced everything, whether he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him. The boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold, for though he “carried weight, ” he danced like an India-rubber ball. He ran, he flew, he pranced, his face glowed, his bald head shone, his coattails waved wildly, his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the music stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.

Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged. When little Vladimir finally relinquished her, with assurances that he was “desolated to leave so early, ” she was ready to rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.

It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted affections find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves will thrill, young blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise, when subjected to the enchantment of beauty, light, music, and motion. Laurie had a waked-up look as he rose to give her his seat; and when he hurried away to bring her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, “Ah, I thought that would do him good! ”

“You look like Balzac's‘Femme Peinte Par Elle-Même', ”he said,as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other.

“My rouge won't come off.” And Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright.

“What do you call this stuff? ” he asked, touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee.

“Illusion.”

“Good name for it. It's very pretty—new thing, isn't it? ”

“It's as old as the hills. You have seen it on dozens of girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now—stupide! ”

“I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake, you see.”

“None of that, it is forbidden. I'd rather take coffee than compliments just now. No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous.”

Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having “little Amy” order him about, for she had lost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him, as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection.

“Where did you learn all this sort of thing? ” he asked with a quizzical look.

“As ‘this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would you kindly explain? ” returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he meant, but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.

“Well—the general air, the style, the self-possession, the—the—illusion—you know, ” laughed Laurie, breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word.

Amy was gratified, but of course didn't show it, and demurely answered, “Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self. I study as well as play, and as for this”—with a little gesture toward her dress—“why, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for nothing, and I am used to making the most of my poor little things.”

Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in good taste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers. Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, nor why he filled up her book with his own name, and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner, but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving.





CHAPTER 38

ON THE SHELF


IN FRANCE THE young girls have a dull time of it till they are married, when“Vive la liberté”becomes their motto. In America, as everyone knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means as quiet. Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most of them might exclaim, as did a very pretty woman the other day, “I'm as handsome as ever, but no one takes any notice of me because I'm married.”

Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old, for in her little world primitive customs prevailed, and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever.

As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct was very strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children, to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else. Day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety, leaving John to the tender mercies of the help, for an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen department. Being a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored his babies, he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored. But three months passed, and there was no return of repose. Meg looked worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of her time, the house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took life “aisy”, kept him on short commons. When he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma, if he came gaily in at night, eager to embrace his family, he was quenched by a “Hush! They are just asleep after worrying all day.” If he proposed a little amusement at home, “No, it would disturb the babies.” If he hinted at a lecture or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a decided “Leave my children for pleasure, never! ” His sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night; his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius, who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above; and when he read his paper of an evening, Demi's colic got into the shipping list and Daisy's fall affected the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic news.

The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had bereft him of his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual “hushing” made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of Babyland. He bore it very patiently for six months, and when no signs of amendment appeared, he did what other paternal exiles do—tried to get a little comfort elsewhere. Scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off, and John fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end. Mrs. Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she performed her mission most successfully. The parlor was always bright and attractive, the chessboard ready, the piano in tune, plenty of gay gossip, and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style.

John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his neighbor's society.

Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and found it a relief to know that John was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor, or tramping about the house and waking the children. But by-and-by, when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours, leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John, and find her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender. She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told, entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain. She was nervous and worn out with watching and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them. Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much devotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle.

“Yes, ” she would say, looking in the glass, “I'm getting old and ugly. John doesn't find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances. Well, the babies love me, they don't care if I am thin and pale and haven't time to crimp my hair, they are my comfort, and some day John will see what I've gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious? ”

To which pathetic appeal Daisy would answer with a coo, or Demi with a crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel,which soothed her solitude for the time being. But the pain increased as politics absorbed John, who was always running over to discuss interesting points with Scott, quite unconscious that Meg missed him. Not a word did she say, however, till her mother found her in tears one day, and insisted on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping spirits had not escaped her observation.

“I wouldn't tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really do need advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well be widowed, ”replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's bib with an injured air.

“Goes on how, my dear? ” asked her mother anxiously.

“He's away all day, and at night when I want to see him, he is continually going over to the Scotts'. It isn't fair that I should have the hardest work, and never any amusement. Men are very selfish, even the best of them.”

“So are women. Don't blame John till you see where you are wrong yourself.”

“But it can't be right for him to neglect me.”

“Don't you neglect him? ”

“Why, Mother, I thought you'd take my part! ”

“So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault is yours, Meg.”

“I don't see how.”

“Let me show you. Did John ever neglect you, as you call it, while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening, his only leisure time? ”

“No, but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend.”

“I think you could, dear, and I think you ought. May I speak quite freely, and will you remember that it's Mother who blames as well as Mother who sympathizes? ”

“Indeed I will! Speak to me as if I were little Meg again. I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything.”

Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and with a little interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever.

“You have only made the mistake that most young wives make—forgotten your duty to your husband in your love for your children. A very natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways, for children should draw you nearer than ever, not separate you, as if they were all yours, and John had nothing to do but support them. I've seen it for some weeks, but have not spoken, feeling sure it would come right in time.”

“I'm afraid it won't. If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm jealous, and I wouldn't insult him by such an idea. He doesn't see that I want him, and I don't know how to tell him without words.”

“Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away. My dear, he's longing for his little home, but it isn't home without you, and you are always in the nursery.”

“Oughtn't I to be there? ”

“Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous, and then you are unfitted for everything. Besides, you owe something to John as well as to the babies. Don't neglect husband for children, don't shut him out of the nursery, but teach him how to help in it. His place is there as well as yours, and the children need him. Let him feel that he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be better for you all.”

“You really think so, Mother? ”

“I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice unless I've proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted myself wholly to you. Poor Father took to his books, after I had refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment alone. I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was too much for me. I nearly spoiled her by indulgence. You were poorly, and I worried about you till I fell sick myself. Then Father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never have been able to get on without him since. That is the secret of our home happiness: he does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but at home we work together, always.”

“It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours. Show me how, I'll do anything you say.”

“You always were my docile daughter. Well, dear, if I were you, I'd let John have more to do with the management of Demi, for the boy needs training, and it's none too soon to begin. Then I'd do what I have often proposed, let Hannah come and help you. She is a capital nurse, and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework. You need the exercise, Hannah would enjoy the rest, and John would find his wife again. Go out more, keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair weather. Then I'd try to take an interest in whatever John likes—talk with him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in that way. Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and educate yourself to take your part in the world's work, for it all affects you and yours.”

“John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if I ask questions about politics and things.”

“I don't believe he would. Love covers a multitude of sins, and of whom could you ask more freely than of him? Try it, and see if he doesn't find your society far more agreeable than Mrs. Scott's suppers.”

“I will.Poor John!I'm afraid I have neglected him sadly,but I thought I was right, and he never said anything.”

“He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn, I fancy. This is just the time, Meg, when young married people are apt to grow apart, and the very time when they ought to be most together; for the first tenderness soon wears off, unless care is taken to preserve it; and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train. Don't let John be a stranger to the babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should. Now, dear, good-by. Think over Mother's preachment, act upon it if it seems good, and God bless you all.”

Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it, though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it. Of course the children tyrannized over her, and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted. Mamma was an abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not so easily subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son. For Demi inherited a trifle of his sire's firmness of character—we won't call it obstinacy—and when he made up his little mind to have or to do anything, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not change that pertinacious little mind. Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience. So Master Demi early discovered that when he undertook to “wrastle” with “parpar”, he always got the worst of it, yet like the Englishman, baby respected the man who conquered him, and loved the father whose grave “No, no, ” was more impressive than all Mamma's love pats.

A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved to try a social evening with John, so she ordered a nice supper, set the parlor in order, dressed herself prettily, and put the children to bed early, that nothing should interfere with her experiment. But unfortunately Demi's most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he decided to go on a rampage. So poor Meg sang and rocked, told stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could devise, but all in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, and long after Daisy had gone to byelow, like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was, naughty Demi lay staring at the light, with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression of countenance.

“Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs down and gives poor Papa his tea? ” asked Meg, as the hall door softly closed, and the well-known step went tip-toeing into the dining room.

“Me has tea! ” said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.

“No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you'll go bye-bye like Daisy. Will you, lovey? ”

“Iss! ” and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day.

Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration. He saw it at once and said with pleased surprise, “Why, little mother, how gay we are tonight. Do you expect company? ”

“Only you, dear.”

“Is it a birthday, anniversary, or anything? ”

“No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a change. You always make yourself nice for table, no matter how tired you are, so why shouldn't I when I have the time? ”

“I do it out of respect for you, my dear, ” said old-fashioned John.

“Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke, ” laughed Meg, looking young and pretty again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.

“Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times. This tastes right. I drink your health, dear.” And John sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as he put down his cup, the door handle rattled mysteriously, and a little voice was heard, saying impatiently—

“Opy doy; me's tummin! ”

“It's that naughty boy. I told him to go to sleep alone, and here he is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas, ” said Meg, answering the call.

“Mornin' now, ” announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered, with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing the “cakies” with loving glances.

“No, it isn't morning yet. You must go to bed, and not trouble poor Mamma. Then you can have the little cake with sugar on it.”

“Me loves Parpar, ” said the artful one, preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys. But John shook his head, and said to Meg—

“If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone, make him do it, or he will never learn to mind you.”

“Yes, of course. Come, Demi, ” and Meg led her son away, feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her, laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery.

Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed, and forbade any more promenades till morning.

“Iss! ” said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar, and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.

Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding, “More sudar, Marmar.”

“Now this won't do, ” said John, hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner. “We shall never know any peace till that child learns to go to bed properly. You have made a slave of yourself long enough. Give him one lesson, and then there will be an end of it. Put him in his bed and leave him, Meg.”

“He won't stay there, he never does unless I sit by him.”

“I'll manage him. Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed, as Mamma bids you.”

“S'ant! ” replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted“cakie”, and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.

“You must never say that to Papa. I shall carry you if you don't go yourself.”

“Go 'way, me don't love Parpar.” And Demi retired to his mother's skirts for protection.

But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered over to the enemy, with a “Be gentle with him, John, ” which struck the culprit with dismay, for when Mamma deserted him, then the judgment day was at hand. Bereft of his cake, defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his wrath, but openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs. The minute he was put into bed on one side, he rolled out on the other, and made for the door, only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again, which lively performance was kept up till the young man's strength gave out, when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice. This vocal exercise usually conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf. No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the “big dark” which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear. This new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for “Marmar”, as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. The plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to Meg's heart, and she ran up to say beseechingly—“Let me stay with him, he'll be good now, John.”

“No, my dear. I've told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him, and he must, if I stay here all night.”

“But he'll cry himself sick, ” pleaded Meg, reproaching herself for deserting her boy.

“No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled, for he will understand that he has got to mind. Don't interfere, I'll manage him.”

“He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness.”

“He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoiled by indulgence.Go down, my dear, and leave the boy to me.”

When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed, and never regretted her docility.

“Please let me kiss him once, John? ”

“Certainly. Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and rest, for she is very tired with taking care of you all day.”

Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory, for after it was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind.

“Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying. I'll cover him up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest, ” thought John, creeping to the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep.

But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him, Demi's eyes opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying with a penitent hiccough, “Me's dood, now.”

Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest. Demi lay fast asleep, not in his usual spreadeagle attitude, but in a subdued bunch, cuddled close in the circle of his father's arm and holding his father's finger, as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy, and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby. So held, John had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole day's work.

As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, “I never need fear that John will be too harsh with my babies;he does know how to manage them,and will be a great help,for Demi is getting too much for me.”

When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg placidly trimming a bonnet, and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election, if he was not too tired. John saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, knowing that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn't keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon appear. He read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner, while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent questions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet. In her secret soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics, and that the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names; but she kept these feminine ideas to herself, and when John paused, shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity, “Well, I really don't see what we are coming to.”

John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand, and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken.

“She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and like millinery for hers, that's only fair, ” thought John the Just, adding aloud, “That's very pretty. Is it what you call a breakfast cap? ”

“My dear man, it's a bonnet! My very best go-to-concert-and-theater bonnet.”

“I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear. How do you keep it on? ”

“These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so.”And Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.

“It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for it looks young and happy again.” And John kissed the smiling face, to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin.

“I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night. I really need some music to put me in tune. Will you, please? ”

“Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you like. You have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and I shall enjoy it, of all things. What put it into your head, little mother? ”

“Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she said I needed change and less care; so Hannah is to help me with the children, and I'm to see to things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before my time. It's only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your sake as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully lately, and I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I can. You don't object, I hope? ”

Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin. All that we have any business to know is that John did not appear to object, judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates. It was not all Paradise by any means, but everyone was better for the division of labor system: the children throve under the paternal rule, for accurate, steadfast John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while Meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband. Home grew homelike again, and John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg with him. The Scotts came to the Brookes' now, and everyone found the little house a cheerful place, full of happiness, content, and family love. Even Sallie Moffatt liked to go there. “It is always so quiet and pleasant here, it does me good, Meg, ” she used to say, looking about her with wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use it in her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in a world of his own, where there was no place for her.

This household happiness did not come all at once, but John and Meg had found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy. This is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world, finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them, undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking side by side, through fair and stormy weather, with a faithful friend, who is, in the true sense of the good old Saxon word, the “house-band”, and learning, as Meg learned, that a woman's happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.





CHAPTER 39

LAZY LAURENCE


LAURIE WENT TO Nice intending to stay a week, and remained a month. He was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part. He rather missed the “petting” he used to receive, and enjoyed a taste of it again, for no attentions, however flattering, from strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home. Amy never would pet him like the others, but she was very glad to see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess. They naturally took comfort in each other's society and were much together, riding, walking, dancing, or dawdling, for at Nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season. But, while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion, they were half-consciously making discoveries and forming opinions about each other. Amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. Amy tried to please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her, and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm. Laurie made no effort of any kind, but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible, trying to forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him. It cost him no effort to be generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise.

“All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day; I preferred to stay at home and write letters. They are done now, and I am going to Valrosa to sketch, will you come? ” said Amy, as she joined Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual, about noon.

“Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk? ” he answered slowly,for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without.

“I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can drive, so you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella, and keep your gloves nice, ”returned Amy, with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids, which were a weak point with Laurie.

“Then I'll go with pleasure.” And he put out his hand for her sketchbook. But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp—

“Don't trouble yourself. It's no exertion to me, but you don't look equal to it.”

Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch.

The two never quarreled—Amy was too well-bred, and just now Laurie was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air; she answered him with a smile, and they went on together in the most amicable manner.

It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes. Here an ancient monastery, whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them. There a bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet. Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by,with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went. Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on the bough. Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside; while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.

Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere. They overhung the archway, thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill. Every shadowy nook, where seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers, and every fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to smile at their own beauty. Roses covered the walls of the house, draped the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and the white-walled city on its shore.

“This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it? Did you ever see such roses? ” asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view, and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.

“No, nor felt such thorns, ” returned Laurie, with his thumb in his mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach.

“Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns, ” said Amy, gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred the wall behind her. She put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering, and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression, for in the Italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition, and he was just then in that state of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy, when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere. He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home. The pale roses Amy gave him were the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or for himself; but the next instant his American common sense got the better of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than Amy had heard since he came.

“It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers, ” she said, thinking her speech amused him.

“Thank you, I will, ” he answered in jest, and a few months later he did it in earnest.

“Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather? ” she asked presently, as she settled herself on a rustic seat.

“Very soon.”

“You have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks.”

“I dare say, short answers save trouble.”

“He expects you, and you really ought to go.”

“Hospitable creature! I know it.”

“Then why don't you do it? ”

“Natural depravity, I suppose.”

“Natural indolence, you mean. It's really dreadful! ” And Amy looked severe.

“Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I went, so I might as well stay and plague you a little longer, you can bear it better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently.” And Laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.

Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture “that boy” and in a minute she began again.

“What are you doing just now? ”

“Watching lizards.”

“No, no. I mean what do you intend and wish to do? ”

“Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me.”

“How provoking you are! I don't approve of cigars and I will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch. I need a figure.”

“With all the pleasure in life. How will you have me—full length or three-quarters, on my head or my heels? I should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture,then put yourself in also and call it‘Dolce far niente'.”

“Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like. I intend to work hard, ”said Amy in her most energetic tone.

“What delightful enthusiasm! ” And he leaned against a tall urn with an air of entire satisfaction.

“What would Jo say if she saw you now? ” asked Amy impatiently, hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic sister's name.

“As usual, ‘Go away, Teddy. I'm busy! '” He laughed as he spoke, but the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over his face, for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet. Both tone and shadow struck Amy, for she had seen and heard them before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on Laurie's face—a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and regret. It was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again. She watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure, thinking how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.

“You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb, ” she said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined against the dark stone.

“Wish I was! ”

“That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. You are so changed, I sometimes think—” There Amy stopped, with a half-timid, half-wistful look, more significant than her unfinished speech.

Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express, and looking straight into her eyes, said, just as he used to say it to her mother, “It's all right, ma'am.”

That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately. It also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the cordial tone in which she said—

“I'm glad of that! I didn't think you'd been a very bad boy, but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked Baden-Baden, lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman with a husband, or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour. Don't stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the grass here and ‘let us be friendly, ' as Jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets.”

Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of Amy's hat, that lay there.

“I'm all ready for the secrets.” And he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes.

“I've none to tell. You may begin.”

“Haven't one to bless myself with. I thought perhaps you'd had some news from home.”

“You have heard all that has come lately. Don't you hear often? I fancied Jo would send you volumes.”

“She's very busy. I'm roving about so, it's impossible to be regular, you know. When do you begin your great work of art, Raphaella? ” he asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it.

“Never, ” she answered, with a despondent but decided air. “Rome took all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the wonders there, I felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair.”

“Why should you, with so much energy and talent? ”

“That's just why—because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing. I won't be a common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more.”

“And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask? ”

“Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society, if I get the chance.”

It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring; but audacity becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good foundation. Laurie smiled, but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a long-cherished one died, and spent no time lamenting.

“Good! And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy.”

Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely, “Now I'm going to play brother, and ask questions. May I? ”

“I don't promise to answer.”

“Your face will, if your tongue won't. You aren't woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear. I heard rumors about Fred and you last year, and it's my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long, something would have come of it—hey? ”

“That's not for me to say, ” was Amy's grim reply, but her lips would smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.

“You are not engaged, I hope? ” And Laurie looked very elder-brotherly and grave all of a sudden.

“No.”

“But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees, won't you? ”

“Very likely.”

“Then you are fond of old Fred? ”

“I could be, if I tried.”

“But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless my soul, what unearthly prudence! He's a good fellow, Amy, but not the man I fancied you'd like.”

“He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners, ” began Amy, trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling a little ashamed of herself, in spite of the sincerity of her intentions.

“I understand. Queens of society can't get on without money, so you mean to make a good match, and start in that way? Quite right and proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother's girls.”

“True, nevertheless.”

A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker. Laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again, with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain. His look and silence, as well as a certain inward self-disapproval, ruffled Amy, and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay.

“I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little, ” she said sharply.

“Do it for me, there's a dear girl.”

“I could, if I tried.” And she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style.

“Try, then. I give you leave, ” returned Laurie, who enjoyed having someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime.

“You'd be angry in five minutes.”

“I'm never angry with you. It takes two flints to make a fire. You are as cool and soft as snow.”

“You don't know what I can do. Snow produces a glow and a tingle, if applied rightly. Your indifference is half affectation, and a good stirring up would prove it.”

“Stir away, it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said when his little wife beat him. Regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees with you.”

Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and began:

“Flo and I have got a new name for you. It's Lazy Laurence. How do you like it? ”

She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his arms under his head, with an imperturbable “That's not bad. Thank you, ladies.”

“Do you want to know what I honestly think of you? ”

“Pining to be told.”

“Well, I despise you.”

If she had even said “I hate you” in a petulant or coquettish tone, he would have laughed and rather liked it, but the grave, almost sad, accent in her voice made him open his eyes, and ask quickly—

“Why, if you please? ”

“Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and happy, you are faulty, lazy, and miserable.”

“Strong language, mademoiselle.”

“If you like it, I'll go on.”

“Pray do, it's quite interesting.”

“I thought you'd find it so. Selfish people always like to talk about themselves.”

“Am I selfish? ” the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity.

“Yes, very selfish, ” continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as effective just then as an angry one. “I'll show you how, for I've studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm not at all satisfied with you. Here you have been abroad nearly six months, and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends.”

“Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind? ”

“You don't look as if you'd had much. At any rate, you are none the better for it, as far as I can see. I said when we first met that you had improved. Now I take it all back, for I don't think you half so nice as when I left you at home. You have grown abominably lazy, you like gossip, and waste time on frivolous things, you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people, instead of being loved and respected by wise ones. With money, talent, position, health, and beauty—ah you like that Old Vanity! But it's the truth, so I can't help saying it—with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you ought to be, you are only—” There she stopped, with a look that had both pain and pity in it.

“Saint Laurence on a gridiron, ” added Laurie, blandly finishing the sentence. But the lecture began to take effect, for there was a wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured expression replaced the former indifference.

“I supposed you'd take it so. You men tell us we are angels, and say we can make you what we will, but the instant we honestly try to do you good, you laugh at us and won't listen, which proves how much your flattery is worth.” Amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet.

In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw, and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, “I will be good, oh, I will be good! ”

But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, “Aren't you ashamed of a hand like that? It's as soft and white as a woman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves and pick flowers for ladies. You are not a dandy, thank Heaven, so I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it, only the little old one Jo gave you so long ago. Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me! ”

“So do I! ”

The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy. She glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind, but he was lying with his hat half over his face, as if for shade, and his mustache hid his mouth. She only saw his chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. All in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in Amy's mind, and told her what her sister never had confided to her. She remembered that Laurie never spoke voluntarily of Jo, she recalled the shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand. Girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence. Amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration, and now she was sure of it. Her keen eyes filled, and when she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so.

“I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if you weren't the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be very angry with me. But we are all so fond and proud of you, I couldn't bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as I have been, though, perhaps they would understand the change better than I do.”

“I think they would, ” came from under the hat, in a grim tone, quite as touching as a broken one.

“They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering and scolding, when I should have been more kind and patient than ever. I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate her! ” said artful Amy, wishing to be sure of her facts this time.

“Hang Miss Randal! ” And Laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady.

“I beg pardon, I thought—” And there she paused diplomatically.

“No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for anyone but Jo, ” Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face away as he spoke.

“I did think so, but as they never said anything about it, and you came away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind to you? Why, I was sure she loved you dearly.”

“She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for her she didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. It's her fault though, and you may tell her so.”

The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and it troubled Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.

“I was wrong, I didn't know. I'm very sorry I was so cross, but I can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear.”

“Don't, that's her name for me! ” And Laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's half-kind, half-reproachful tone. “Wait till you've tried it yourself, ” he added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful.

“I'd take it manfully, and be respected if I couldn't be loved, ” said Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it.

Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well, making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his trouble away to live it down alone. Amy's lecture put the matter in a new light, and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure, and shut himself up in moody indifference. He felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again. Presently he sat up and asked slowly, “Do you think Jo would despise me as you do? ”

“Yes, if she saw you now. She hates lazy people. Why don't you do something splendid,and make her love you? ”

“I did my best, but it was no use.”

“Graduating well, you mean? That was no more than you ought to have done, for your grandfather's sake. It would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money, when everyone knew that you could do well.”

“I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me, ” began Laurie, leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude.

“No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did you good, and proved that you could do something if you tried. If you'd only set about another task of some sort, you'd soon be your hearty, happy self again, and forget your trouble.”

“That's impossible.”

“Try it and see. You needn't shrug your shoulders, and think,‘Much she knows about such things.'I don't pretend to be wise,but I am observing, and I see a great deal more than you'd imagine. I'm interested in other people's experiences and inconsistencies, and though I can't explain, I remember and use them for my own benefit. Love Jo all your days, if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the one you want. There, I won't lecture any more, for I know you'll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl.”

Neither spoke for several minutes. Laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked. Presently she put it on his knee, merely saying,“How do you like that? ”

He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help doing, for it was capitally done—the long, lazy figure on the grass, with listless face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding a cigar, from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the dreamer's head.

“How well you draw! ” he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, “Yes, that's me.”

“As you are: this is as you were.” And Amy laid another sketch beside the one he held.

It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked. Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse: hat and coat were off, and every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider's breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the“Dolce far niente”sketch. Laurie said nothing, but as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him. That satisfied her, and without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way—

“Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck, and we all looked on? Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo clapped and pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you. I found that sketch in my portfolio the other day, touched it up, and kept it to show you.”

“Much obliged. You've improved immensely since then, and I congratulate you. May I venture to suggest in ‘a honeymoon paradise' that five o'clock is the dinner hour at your hotel? ”

Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end. He tried to resume his former easy, indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for the rousing had been more efficacious than he would confess. Amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner, and said to herself—

“Now, I've offended him. Well, if it does him good, I'm glad, if it makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and I can't take back a word of it.”

They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little Baptiste, up behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits. But both felt ill at ease: the friendly frankness was disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each.

“Shall we see you this evening,mon frère? ”asked Amy,as they parted at her aunt's door.

“Unfortunately I have an engagement.Au revoir,madamoiselle.”And Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became him better than many men. Something in his face made Amy say quickly and warmly—

“No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way. I'd rather have a hearty English handshake than all the sentimental salutations in France.”

“Good-by, dear.” And with these words, uttered in the tone she liked, Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.

Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end:





My Dear Mentor,

Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself, for“Lazy Laurence” has gone to his grandpa, like the best of boys. A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa! I think Fred would be benefited by a rouser. Tell him so, with my congratulations.

Yours gratefully

TELEMACHUS





“Good boy! I'm glad he's gone, ” said Amy, with an approving smile. The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room, adding, with an involuntary sigh,“Yes,I am glad,but how I shall miss him! ”





CHAPTER 40

THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW


WHEN THE FIRST BITTERNESS was over, the family accepted the inevitable, and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble. They put away their grief, and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one.

The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was gathered everything that she most loved—flowers, pictures, her piano, the little worktable, and the beloved pussies. Father's best books found their way there, Mother's easy chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest sketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage, to make sunshine for Aunty Beth. John quietly set apart a little sum, that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for. Old Hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears as she worked; and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter.

Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth, tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet, unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind. The feeble fingers were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the schoolchildren daily passing to and fro—to drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs. If Beth had wanted any reward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.

The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look round, and say “How beautiful this is! ” as they all sat together in her sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and sisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as applicable now as when written centuries ago; a little chapel, where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation possible. Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of those who listened, for the father's heart was in the minister's religion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read.

It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come; for, by-and-by, Beth said the needle was ‘so heavy, ' and put it down forever. Talking wearied her, faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh. Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching hearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the bitter cry, “Help me, help me! ” and to feel that there was no help. A sad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with death, but both were mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion over, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever. With the wreck of her frail body, Beth's soul grew strong, and though she said little, those about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore, trying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river.

Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said, “I feel stronger when you are here.” She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything, and “tried not to be a trouble.” All day she haunted the room,jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her. Precious and helpful hours to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it needed: lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them; charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly.

Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was trying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the life to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music she loved so well.

Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter; for, with eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life—uneventful, unambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which “smell sweet, and blossom in the dust, ” the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible to all.

One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain,as she turned the leaves of her old favorite,Pilgrims's Progress,she found a little paper,scribbled over in Jo's hand.The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it.

“Poor Jo! She's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave. She shows me all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at this, ”thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug, with the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart.





MY BETH





Sitting patient in the shadow

Till the blessed light shall come,

A serene and saintly presence

Sanctifies our troubled home.

Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows

Break like ripples on the strand

Of the deep and solemn river

Where her willing feet now stand.





O my sister, passing from me,

Out of human care and strife,

Leave me, as a gift, those virtues

Which have beautified your life.

Dear, bequeath me that great patience

Which has power to sustain

A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit

In its prison-house of pain.





Give me, for I need it sorely,

Of that courage, wise and sweet,

Which has made the path of duty

Green beneath your willing feet.

Give me that unselfish nature,

That with charity divine

Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake—

Meek heart, forgive me mine!





Thus our parting daily loseth

Something of its bitter pain,

And while learning this hard lesson,

My great loss becomes my gain.

For the touch of grief will render

My wild nature more serene,

Give to life new aspirations,

A new trust in the unseen.





Henceforth, safe across the river,

I shall see forever more

A beloved, household spirit

Waiting for me on the shore.

Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,

Guardian angels shall become,

And the sister gone before me

By their hands shall lead me home.





Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one regret had been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the despair she feared. As she sat with the paper folded between her hands, the charred log fell asunder. Jo started up, revived the blaze, and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.

“Not asleep, but so happy, dear. See, I found this and read it. I knew you wouldn't care. Have I been all that to you, Jo? ” she asked, with wistful, humble earnestness.

“Oh, Beth, so much, so much! ” And Jo's head went down upon the pillow beside her sister's.

“Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life. I'm not so good as you make me,but I have tried to do right.And now,when it's too late to begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that someone loves me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them.”

“More than any one in the world, Beth. I used to think I couldn't let you go, but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose you, that you'll be more to me than ever, and death can't part us, though it seems to.”

“I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm sure I shall be your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever. You must take my place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother when I'm gone. They will turn to you, don't fail them, and if it's hard to work alone, remember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the end so easy.”

“I'll try, Beth.” And then and there Jo renounced her old ambition, pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the immortality of love.

So the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back in time to say good-by to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child, clung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and Mother guided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up to God.

Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see visions, or depart with beatified countenances, and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep. As Beth had hoped, the “tide went out easily, ” and in the dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving look, one little sigh.

With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom full of dread.

When morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out, Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still. But a bird sang blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow—a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked God that Beth was well at last.





CHAPTER 41

LEARNING TO FORGET


AMY'S LECTURE DID Laurie good, though, of course, he did not own it till long afterward; men seldom do, for when women are the advisers, the lords of creation don't take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do; then they act upon it, and, if it succeeds, they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it;if it fails, they generously give her the whole. Laurie went back to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had improved him wonderfully, and he had better try it again. There was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better, but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received; pride forbid, and whenever the longing grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impression— “I despise you.” “Go and do something splendid that will make her love you.”

Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy,but then when a man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down. He felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now, and though he should never cease to be a faithful mourner, there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously.Jo wouldn't love him,but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a girl's “No” had not spoiled his life. He had always meant to do something, and Amy's advice was quite unnecessary. He had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred. That being done, he felt that he was ready to “hide his stricken heart, and still toil on.”

As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so Laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose a Requiem which should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the heart of every hearer. Therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off, he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends, and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself. But, whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered that the Requiem was beyond him just at present. It was evident that his mind was not in working order yet, and his ideas needed clarifying, for often in the middle of a plaintive strain, he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the stout Frenchman, and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being.

Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning, but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him. He wanted Jo for his heroine, and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love. But memory turned traitor;and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl, would only recall Jo's oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in the most unsentimental aspects—beating mats with her head tied up in a bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold water over his passion à la Gummidge—and an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. Jo wouldn't be put into the opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a “Bless that girl, what a torment she is! ” and a clutch at his hair, as became a distracted composer.

When he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the most obliging readiness. This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and blue ribbons. He did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as well he might, for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted her, unscathed, through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman.

Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time, but gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose, while he sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city to get some new ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter. He did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. “It's genius simmering, perhaps. I'll let it simmer, and see what comes of it, ” he said, with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasn't genius, but something far more common. Whatever it was, it simmered to some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work to go at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music was not a composer. Returning from one of Mozart's grand operas, splendidly performed at the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own, played a few of the best parts, sat staring at the busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Bach, who stared benignly back again; then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as the last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself—

“She is right! Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it so. That music has taken the vanity out of me as Rome took it out of her, and I won't be a humbug any longer. Now what shall I do? ”

That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread. Now if ever, occurred an eligible opportunity for “going to the devil, ” as he once forcibly expressed it, for he had plenty of money and nothing to do, and Satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and idle hands. The poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood them pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him, and say “All's well, ” kept him safe and steady.

Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, “I don't believe it, boys will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not expect miracles.”I dare say you don't, Mrs. Grundy, but it's true nevertheless. Women work a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings. Let the boys be boys, the longer the better, and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must. But mothers, sisters, and friends may help to make the crop a small one, and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest, by believing, and showing that they believe, in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good women's eyes. If it is a feminine delusion, leave us to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads, who still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it.

Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo would absorb all his powers for years, but to his great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day. He refused to believe it at first, got angry with himself, and couldn't understand it, but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in spite of us. Laurie's heart wouldn't ache.The wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him, and instead of trying to forget, he found himself trying to remember. He had not foreseen this turn of affairs, and was not prepared for it. He was disgusted with himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon. He carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze: there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever, and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subsiding into a more tranquil sentiment, very tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was sure to pass away in time, leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end.

As the word “brotherly” passed through his mind in one of his reveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of Mozart that was before him:

“Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn't have one sister he took the other, and was happy.”

Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and the next instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself, “No, I won't! I haven't forgotten, I never can. I'll try again, and if that fails, why, then—”

Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind. Couldn't she, wouldn't she—and let him come home and be happy? While waiting for an answer he did nothing, but he did it energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience. It came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo decidedly couldn't and wouldn't. She was wrapped up in Beth, and never wished to hear the word“love” again. Then she begged him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister Jo. In a postscript she desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay. That would be time enough, please God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel lonely, homesick or anxious.

“So I will, at once. Poor little girl, it will be a sad going home for her, I'm afraid.” And Laurie opened his desk, as if writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before.

But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged out his best paper, he came across something which changed his purpose. Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters, and in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside. With a half-repentant, half-amused expression, Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies.

The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered, for Amy was homesick, and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner. The correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring. Laurie sold his busts, made allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris, hoping somebody would arrive before long. He wanted desperately to go to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not ask him, for just then she was having little experiences of her own, which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of “our boy”.

Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which she had once decided to answer, “Yes, thank you, ” but now she said, “No, thank you, ”kindly but steadily, for, when the time came, her courage failed her, and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears. The words, “Fred is a good fellow, but not at all the man I fancied you would ever like, ” and Laurie's face when he uttered them, kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look, if not in words, “I shall marry for money.” It troubled her to remember that now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so unwomanly. She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless, worldly creature; she didn't care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman. She was so glad he didn't hate her for the dreadful things she said, but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever. His letters were such a comfort, for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come. It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them, for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo persisted in being stonyhearted. She ought to have made an effort and tried to love him. It couldn't be very hard, many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them: but Jo never would act like other girls, so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother.

If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at this period, they would be a much happier race of beings than they are. Amy never lectured now. She asked his opinion on all subjects, she was interested in everything he did, made charming little presents for him, and sent him two letters a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her. As few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that Amy did any of these fond and foolish things. But she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went out sketching alone a good deal. She never had much to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare say, while she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her—a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a curly-haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether satisfactory.

Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred, and finding denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy left her to think what she liked, taking care that Laurie should know that Fred had gone to Egypt. That was all, but he understood it, and looked relieved, as he said to himself, with a venerable air—

“I was sure she would think better of it. Poor old fellow! I've been through it all, and I can sympathize.”

With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had discharged his duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed Amy's letter luxuriously.

While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had come at home. But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and when the next found her at Vevay, for the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they had travelled slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian lakes. She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit, for, since it was too late to say good-by to Beth, she had better stay, and let absence soften her sorrow. But her heart was very heavy, she longed to be at home, and every day looked wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and comfort her.

He did come very soon; for the same mail brought letters to them both, but he was in Germany, and it took some days to reach him. The moment he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow, hope and suspense.

He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the little quay,he hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the Carrols were living en pension.The garçon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake; but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden. If monsieur would give himself the pain of sitting down, a flash of time should present her. But monsieur could not wait even a “flash of time”, and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself.

A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water. At one corner of the wide, low wall was a seat, and here Amy often came to read or work, or console herself with the beauty all about her. She was sitting here that day, leaning her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes, thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come. She did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden. He stood a minute, looking at her with new eyes, seeing what no one had ever seen before—the tender side of Amy's character. Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow—the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face; even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. If he had any doubts about the reception she would give him, they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing—

“Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me! ”

I think everything was said and settled then, for as they stood together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as Laurie, and Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who could fill Jo's place and make him happy. He did not tell her so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth, were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.

In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she dried her tears, Laurie gathered up the scattered papers, finding in the sight of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future. As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting.

“I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so very glad to see you. It was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn't come, ” she said, trying in vain to speak quite naturally.

“I came the minute I heard. I wish I could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only feel, and—” He could not get any further, for he too turned bashful all of a sudden, and did not quite know what to say. He longed to lay Amy's head down on his shoulder, and tell her to have a good cry, but he did not dare, so took her hand instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words.

“You needn't say anything, this comforts me, ” she said softly. “Beth is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back, but I dread the going home, much as I long to see them all. We won't talk about it now, for it makes me cry, and I want to enjoy you while you stay. You needn't go right back, need you? ”

“Not if you want me, dear.”

“I do, so much. Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you seem like one of the family, and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while.”

Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and gave her just what she wanted—the petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed.

“Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself half sick! I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any more, but come and walk about with me, the wind is too chilly for you to sit still, ” he said, in the half-caressing, half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on her hat, drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts. He felt more at ease upon his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon, a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone.

The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers, and seemed expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was it, with nothing but the tower to overlook them, and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words, as it rippled by below. For an hour this new pair walked and talked, or rested on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of loneliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.

The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she was illuminated with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself, “Now I understand it all—the child has been pining for young Laurence. Bless my heart, I never thought of such a thing! ”

With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing, and betrayed no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged Laurie to stay and begged Amy to enjoy his society, for it would do her more good than so much solitude. Amy was a model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it with more than her usual success.

At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded. At Vevay, Laurie was never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the most energetic manner, while Amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could. He said the change was owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.

The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies. They seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills; the fresh winds blew away desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists; the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas, tender hopes, and happy thoughts. The lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying,“Little children, love one another.”

In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so happy that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word. It took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first, and, as he had firmly believed, his last and only love. He consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that Jo's sister was almost the same as Jo's self, and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well. His first wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret. He was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of the bittersweet experiences of his life, for which he could be grateful when the pain was over. His second wooing, he resolved, should be as calm and simple as possible: there was no need of having a scene, hardly any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago. It all came about so naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that everybody would be pleased, even Jo. But when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance.

He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the château garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and decorous manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words. They had been floating about all the morning, from gloomy St. Gingolf to sunny Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side, Mont St. Bernard and the Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged gulls.

They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past Chillon, and of Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he wrote his Héloise. Neither had read it, but they knew it was a love story, and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own. Amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them, and when she looked up, Laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily, merely for the sake of saying something—

“You must be tired. Rest a little, and let me row. It will do me good, for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious.”

“I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like. There's room enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the boat won't trim, ”returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangement.

Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the offered third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted an oar. She rowed as well as she did many other things; and though she used both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went smoothly through the water.

“How well we pull together, don't we? ” said Amy, who objected to silence just then.

“So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat. Will you, Amy? ” very tenderly.

“Yes, Laurie, ” very low.

Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake.





CHAPTER 42

ALL ALONE


It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was wrapped up in another, and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example; but when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very hard to keep. How could she “comfort Father and Mother” when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister, how could she “make the house cheerful” when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the old home for the new, and where in all the world could she “find some useful, happy work to do, ” that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward? She tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along. Some people seemed to get all sunshine, and some all shadow. It was not fair, for she tried more than Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble, and hard work.

Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier. “I can't do it. I wasn't meant for a life like this, and I know I shall break away and do something desperate if somebody doesn't come and help me, ” she said to herself, when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.

But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity. Often she started up at night, thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, “Oh, Beth, come back! Come back! ” she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain. For, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister's faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than Jo's, and broken whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. Sacred moments, when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night, turning affliction to a blessing, which chastened grief and strengthned love. Feeling this, Jo's burden seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more endurable, seen from the safe shelter of her mother's arms.

When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said very humbly,“Father, talk to me as you did to Beth. I need it more than she did, for I'm all wrong.”

“My dear, nothing can comfort me like this, ” he answered, with a falter in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too, needed help, and did not fear to ask for it.

Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told her troubles—the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless efforts that discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look so dark, and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair. She gave him entire confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and both found consolation in the act;for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter, but as man and woman, able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love. Happy, thoughtful times there in the old study which Jo called “the church of one member”, and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit; for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear, were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust, and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power.

Other helps had Jo—humble, wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to see and value. Brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been, for Beth had presided over both; and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush, never thrown away. As she used them, Jo found herself humming the songs Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though she didn't know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand—

“You thoughtful creeter, you're determined we shan't miss that dear lamb ef you can help it. We don't say much, but we see it, and the Lord will bless you for't, see ef He don't.”

As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved her sister Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew about good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy she was in husband and children, and how much they were all doing for each other.

“Marriage is an excellent thing, after all. I wonder if I should blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it? ” said Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy-turvy nursery.

“It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature, Jo. You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside, but silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at it. Love will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough burr will fall off.”

“Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma'am, and it takes a good shake to bring them down. Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged by them, ”returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.

Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old spirit, but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially as two of Meg's most effective arguments were the babies, whom Jo loved tenderly. Grief is the best opener of some hearts, and Jo's was nearly ready for the bag: a little more sunshine to ripen the nut, then, not a boy's impatient shake, but a man's hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr, and find the kernal sound and sweet. If she suspected this, she would have shut up tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately she wasn't thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she dropped.

Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in her pocket. But, you see, Jo wasn't a heroine, she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others, and she just acted out her nature, being sad, cross, listless, or energetic, as the mood suggested. It's highly virtuous to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once, and it takes a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way. Jo had got so far, she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did not; but to do it cheerfully—ah, that was another thing! She had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how hard; and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her? And if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be harder for a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?

Providence had taken her at her word; here was the task, not what she had expected, but better because self had no part in it; now, could she do it? She decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she found the helps I have suggested. Still another was given her, and she took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort, as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested, as he climbed the hill called Difficulty.

“Why don't you write? That always used to make you happy, ” said her mother once, when the desponding fit over shadowed Jo.

“I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my things.”

“We do. Write something for us, and never mind the rest of the world. Try it, dear. I'm sure it would do you good, and please us very much.”

“Don't believe I can.” But Jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her half-finished manuscripts.

An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success of her suggestion. Jo never knew how it happened, but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it, for when her family had laughed and cried over it, her father sent it, much against her will, to one of the popular magazines, and to her utter surprise, it was not only paid for, but others requested. Letters from several persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends admired it. For a small thing it was a great success, and Jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once.

“I don't understand it.What can there be in a simple little story like that to make people praise it so? ” she said, quite bewildered.

“There is truth in it,Jo,that's the secret.Humor and pathos make it alive, and you have found your style at last. You wrote with no thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it, my daughter. You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet. Do your best, and grow as happy as we are in your success.”

“If there is anything good or true in what I write,it isn't mine.I owe it all to you and Mother and Beth, ” said Jo, more touched by her father's words than by any amount of praise from the world.

So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories, and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers; for they were kindly welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.

When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March feared that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but her fears were soon set at rest, for though Jo looked grave at first, she took it very quietly, and was full of hopes and plans for “the children” before she read the letter twice. It was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection to make.

“You like it, Mother? ” said Jo, as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another.

“Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she had refused Fred. I felt sure then that something better than what you call the‘mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and Laurie would win the day.”

“How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent! You never said a word to me.”

“Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage. I was half afraid to put the idea into your head, lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled.”

“I'm not the scatterbrain I was. You may trust me. I'm sober and sensible enough for anyone's confidante now.”

“So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine, only I fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved someone else.”

“Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and selfish, after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best? ”

“I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought that if he came back, and asked again, you might, perhaps, feel like giving another answer. Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that you are very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart. So I fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now.”

“No, Mother, it is better as it is, and I'm glad Amy has learned to love him.But you are right in one thing:I am lonely,and perhaps if Teddy had tried again, I might have said ‘Yes, ' not because I love him any more, but because I care more to be loved than when he went away.”

“I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on. There are plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father and Mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward.”

“Mothers are the best lovers in the world,but I don't mind whispering to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds. It's very curious, but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections, the more I seem to want. I'd no idea hearts could take in so many. Mine is so elastic, it never seems full now, and I used to be quite contented with my family. I don't understand it.”

“I do.” And Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned back the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.

“It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me. He isn't sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in all he says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that I don't seem to be the same girl I was. I never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it's mine. He says he feels as if he ‘could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate, and lots of love for ballast.' I pray he may, and try to be all he believes me, for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while God lets us be together. Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world could be, when two people love and live for one another! ”

“And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy! Truly, love does work miracles. How very, very happy they must be! ” And Jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader fast till the end comes, and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again.

By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not walk. A restless spirit possessed her, and the old feeling came again, not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked, the other nothing. It was not true, she knew that and tried to put it away, but the natural craving for affection was strong, and Amy's happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to “love with heart and soul, and cling to while God let them be together.”

Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owner's name, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all. Jo glanced into them, and when she came to her own, leaned her chin on the edge, and stared absently at the chaotic collection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye. She drew them out, turned them over, and relived that pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's. She had smiled at first, then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a little message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began to tremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking at the friendly words, as they took a new meaning, and touched a tender spot in her heart.

“Wait for me, my friend. I may be a little late, but I shall surely come.”

“Oh, if he only would! So kind, so good, so patient with me always;my dear old Fritz. I didn't value him half enough when I had him, but now how I should love to see him, for everyone seems going away from me, and I'm all alone.”

And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag, and cried, as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof.

Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits? Or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer? Who shall say?





CHAPTER 43

SURPRISES


JO WAS ALONE in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking at the fire, and thinking. It was her favorite way of spending the hour of dusk. No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away. Her face looked tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow was her birthday, and she was thinking how fast the years went by, how old she was getting, and how little she seemed to have accomplished. Almost twenty-five, and nothing to show for it. Jo was mistaken in that. There was a good deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.

“An old maid, that's what I'm to be. A literary spinster, with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and twenty years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps; when, like poor Johnson, I'm old and can't enjoy it, solitary, and can't share it, independent, and don't need it. Well, I needn't be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say, old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but—” And there Jo sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.

It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to five-and-twenty. But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can get on quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall back upon. At twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old maids, but secretly resolve that they never will be. At thirty they say nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully. Don't laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for often very tender, tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts that beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces beautiful in God's sight. Even the sad, sour sisters should be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest part of life, if for no other reason. And, looking at them with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time. That rosy cheeks don't last forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now.

Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. Just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks; the scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live. The bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them; and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt Priscilla, who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for “the best nevvy in the world”.

Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during this little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to stand before her—a substantial, lifelike ghost—leaning over her with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and didn't like to show it. But, like Jenny in the ballad—





She could not think it he,





and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and kissed her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully—

“Oh my Teddy! Oh my Teddy! ”

“Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then? ”

“Glad! My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness. Where's Amy? ”

“Your mother has got her down at Meg's. We stopped there by the way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches.”

“Your what? ” cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.

“Oh, the dickens! Now I've done it.” And he looked so guilty that Jo was down on him like a flash.

“You've gone and got married! ”

“Yes, please, but I never will again.” And he went down upon his knees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face full of mischief, mirth, and triumph.

“Actually married? ”

“Very much so, thank you.”

“Mercy on us. What dreadful thing will you do next? ” And Jo fell into her seat with a gasp.

“A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation, ”returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with satisfaction.

“What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping in like a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get up, you ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it.”

“Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and promise not to barricade.”

Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day, and patted the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone, “The old pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now. So, come and fess, Teddy.”

“How good it sounds to hear you say ‘Teddy! ' No one ever calls me that but you.” And Laurie sat down with an air of great content.

“What does Amy call you? ”

“My lord.”

“That's like her. Well, you look it.” And Jo's eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever.

The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless—a natural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible barrier cast a little shadow over them. It was gone directly, however, for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at dignity—

“Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family? ”

“Not a bit, and you never will. You've grown bigger and bonnier, but you are the same scapegrace as ever.”

“Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect, ” began Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.

“How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled, is so irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober! ” answered Jo, smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant old fashion.

“It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for they are all coming up presently. I couldn't wait; I wanted to be the one to tell you the grand surprise, and have ‘first skim' as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream.”

“Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at the wrong end. Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened. I'm pining to know.”

“Well, I did it to please Amy, ” began Laurie, with a twinkle that made Jo exclaim—

“Fib number one. Amy did it to please you. Go on, and tell the truth, if you can, sir.”

“Now she's beginning to marm it. Isn't it jolly to hear her? ” said Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it quite agreed. “It's all the same, you know, she and I being one. We planned to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but they suddenly changed their minds, and decided to pass another winter in Paris. But Grandpa wanted to come home. He went to please me, and I couldn't let him go alone, neither could I leave Amy, and Mrs. Carrol had got English notions about chaperons and such nonsense, and wouldn't let Amy come with us. So I just settled the difficulty by saying, ‘Let's be married, and then we can do as we like.'”

“Of course you did. You always have things to suit you.”

“Not always.” And something in Laurie's voice made Jo say hastily—

“How did you ever get Aunt to agree? ”

“It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we had heaps of good reasons on our side. There wasn't time to write and ask leave, but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by, and it was only‘taking time by the fetlock, ' as my wife says.”

“Aren't we proud of those two words, and don't we like to say them? ”interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.

“A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I can't help being proud of her. Well, then Uncle and Aunt were there to play propriety. We were so absorbed in one another we were of no mortal use apart, and that charming arrangement would make everything easy all round, so we did it.”

“When, where, how? ” asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest and curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.

“Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris; a very quiet wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget dear little Beth.”

Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow, which he remembered well.

“Why didn't you let us know afterward? ” asked Jo, in a quieter tone, when they had sat quite still a minute.

“We wanted to surprise you. We thought we were coming directly home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found he couldn't be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked. Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we went there, and were as happy as people are but once in their lives. My faith! Wasn't it love among the roses! ”

Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of it, for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. She tried to draw away her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before—

“Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by forever. As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had been so kind to me, I never shall stop loving you; but the love is altered, and I have learned to see that it is better as it is. Amy and you changed places in my heart, that's all. I think it was meant to be so, and would have come about naturally, if I had waited, as you tried to make me; but I never could be patient, and so I got a heartache. I was a boy then, headstrong and violent; and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake.For it was one,Jo,as you said,and I found it out, after making a fool of myself. Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that I didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love you both alike. But I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland, everything seemed to clear up all at once. You both got into your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the old love before it was on with the new; that I could honestly share my heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly. Will you believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we first knew one another? ”

“I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can be boy and girl again: the happy old times can't come back, and we mustn't expect it. We are man and woman now, with sober work to do, for playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking. I'm sure you feel this. I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me. I shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be what I hoped he would. We can't be little playmates any longer, but we will be brother and sister, to love and help one another all our lives, won't we, Laurie? ”

He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and laid his face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the grave of a boyish passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong friendship to bless them both. Presently Jo said cheerfully, for she didn't want the coming home to be a sad one, “I can't make it true that you children are really married, and going to set up housekeeping. Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore, and pulling your hair when you teased. Mercy me, how time does fly! ”

“As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't talk so like a grandma. I flatter myself I'm a ‘gentleman growed' as Peggotty said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her rather a precocious infant, ”said Laurie, looking amused at her maternal air.

“You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much older in feeling, Teddy. Women always are, and this last year has been such a hard one that I feel forty.”

“Poor Jo! We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring. You are older.Here's a line,and there's another.Unless you smile,your eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now, I found a tear on it. You've had a great deal to bear, and had to bear it all alone. What a selfish beast I've been! ” And Laurie pulled his own hair, with a remorseful look.

But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered, in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful, “No, I had Father and Mother to help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the thought that you and Amy were safe and happy,to make the troubles here easier to bear.I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's good for me, and—”

“You never shall be again, ” broke in Laurie, putting his arm about her, as if to fence out every human ill. “Amy and I can't get on without you, so you must come and teach ‘the children' to keep house, and go halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and all be blissfully happy and friendly together.”

“If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant. I begin to feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles seemed to fly away when you came. You always were a comfort, Teddy.” And Jo leaned her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago, when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold on to him.

He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time, but Jo was smiling to herself,as if,in truth,her troubles had all vanished at his coming.

“You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute, and laughing the next. You look a little wicked now. What is it, Grandma? ”

“I was wondering how you and Amy get on together.”

“Like angels! ”

“Yes, of course, but which rules? ”

“I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let her think so—it pleases her, you know. By-and-by we shall take turns, for marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles one's duties.”

“You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the days of your life.”

“Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind much. She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well. In fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while.”

“That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it! ” cried Jo, with uplifted hands.

It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his “high and mighty” air, “Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the sort of man to submit to it. My wife and I respect ourselves and one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel.”

Jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her pleasure.

“I am sure of that. Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to. She is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed the man best,you remember.”

“She can blow him up as well as shine on him, ” laughed Laurie. “Such a lecture as I got at Nice! I give you my word it was a deal worse than any of your scoldings—a regular rouser.I'll tell you all about it sometime—she never will, because after telling me that she despised and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable party and married the good-for-nothing.”

“What baseness! Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll defend you.”

“I look as if I needed it, don't I? ” said Laurie, getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, “Where is she? Where's my dear old Jo? ”

In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over. Mr. Laurence, hale and hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever. It was good to see him beam at “my children”, as he called the young pair. It was better still to see Amy pay him the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart, and best of all, to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made.

The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that her own dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Moffat would be entirely eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that “her ladyship” was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman. Jo thought, as she watched the pair, “How well they look together! I was right, and Laurie has found the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become his home better than clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to him.” Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness.

For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens a peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool, prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning. No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace, for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true gentlewoman she had hoped to become.

“Love has done much for our little girl, ” said her mother softly.

“She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear, ” Mr. March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him.

Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her “pitty aunty”, but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full of delightful charms. Demi paused to consider the new relationship before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne. A flank movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew where to have him.

“Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance you hit me in the face: now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman, ” and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small nephew in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted his boyish soul.

“Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot; ain't it a relishin' sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, and hear folks calling little Amy, Mis. Laurence? ” muttered old Hannah, who could not resist frequent peeks through the slide as she set the table in a most decidedly promiscuous manner.

Mercy on us, how they did talk! First one, then the other, then all burst out together, trying to tell the history of three years in half an hour. It was fortunate that tea was at hand, to produce a lull and provide refreshment, for they would have been hoarse and faint if they had gone on much longer. Such a happy procession as filed away into the little dining room! Mr. March proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence. Mrs. March as proudly leaned on the arm of “my son”. The old gentleman took Jo, with a whispered, “You must be my girl now, ” and a glance at the empty corner by the fire, that made Jo whisper back, “I'll try to fill her place, sir.”

The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at hand, for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were left to revel at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they made the most of the opportunity. Didn't they steal sips of tea, stuff gingerbread ad libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a crowning trespass, didn't they each whisk a captivating little tart into their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumble treacherously, teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail? Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts, and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little sinners attached themselves to “Dranpa”, who hadn't his spectacles on. Amy, who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on Father Laurence's arm. The others paired off as before, and this arrangement left Jo companionless. She did not mind it at the minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.

“Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver dishes that's stored away over yander? ”

“Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day. Teddy thinks nothing too good for her, ” returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.

“No more there is! Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast? ”asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.

“I don't care.” And Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an uncongenial topic just then. She stood a minute looking at the party vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the last stair, a sudden sense of loneliness came over her so strongly that she looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to lean upon, for even Teddy had deserted her. If she had known what birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would not have said to herself, “I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed. It won't do to be dismal now.” Then she drew her hand over her eyes—for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was—and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door.

She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another ghost had come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded gentleman, beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.

“Oh,Mr.Bhaer,I am so glad to see you! ”cried Jo,with a clutch,as if she feared the night would swallow him up before she could get him in.

“And I to see Miss Marsch—but no, you haf a party—” And the Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing feet came down to them.

“No, we haven't, only the family. My sister and friends have just come home, and we are all very happy. Come in, and make one of us.”

Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone decorously away, and come again another day; but how could he, when Jo shut the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? Perhaps her face had something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him, and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes.

“If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see them all. You haf been ill, my friend? ”

He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat, the light fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.

“Not ill, but tired and sorrowful. We have had trouble since I saw you last.”

“Ah, yes, I know. My heart was sore for you when I heard that.” And he shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face that Jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind eyes, the grasp of the big, warm hand.

“Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer, ” she said, with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened the door with a flourish.

If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received. Everyone greeted him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his own. They could not help it, for he carried the talisman that opens all hearts, and these simple people warmed to him at once, feeling even the more friendly because he was poor. For poverty enriches those who live above it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits. Mr. Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself at home. The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him by rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his watch, with juvenile audacity. The women telegraphed their approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his guest's benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but said not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to sleep.

If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior would have amused her; for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but something like suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof at first, and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection. But it did not last long. He got interested in spite of himself, and, before he knew it, was drawn into the circle. For Mr. Bhaer talked well in this genial atmosphere, and did himself justice. He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him often, and a shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. Then his eyes would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it. But Jo had her own eyes to take care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting, like a model maiden aunt.

A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of fresh water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed her several propitious omens. Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the absent-minded expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment. Then he seemed quite inspired, though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the conversation had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic. Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in an argument, and thought to herself, as she watched her father's absorbed face, “How he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor to talk with every day! ” Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a gentleman than ever. His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do; and Jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a Jove-like aspect. Poor Jo, how she did glorify that plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands.

“Dear old fellow! He couldn't have got himself up with more care if he'd been going a-wooing, ” said Jo to herself, and then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully that she had to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.

The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the little blue ball. Of course they bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left them.

Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest. The others sat round the fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse of time, till Meg, whose maternal mind was impressed with a firm conviction that Daisy had tumbled out of bed, and Demi set his nightgown afire studying the structure of matches, made a move to go.

“We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all together again once more, ” said Jo, feeling that a good shout would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of her soul.

They were not all there. But no one found the words thougtless or untrue; for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence, invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break the household league that love made dissoluble. The little chair stood in its old place; the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew “so heavy, ”was still on its accustomed shelf; the beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved, and above it Beth's face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon them, seeming to say, “Be happy. I am here.”

“Play something, Amy. Let them hear how much you have improved, ”said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.

But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded stool, “Not tonight, dear. I can't show off tonight.”

But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught, and touched the listeners' hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her. The room was very still, when the clear voice failed suddenly at the last line of Beth's favorite hymn. It was hard to say—





Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;





and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.

“Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings that, ”said Jo, before the pause grew painful. And Mr. Bhaer cleared his throat with a gratified “Hem! ” as he stepped into the corner where Jo stood, saying—

“You will sing with me? We go excellently well together.”

A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of music than a grasshopper. But she would have consented if he had proposed to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless of time and tune. It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer sang like a true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon subsided into a subdued hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that seemed to sing for her alone.





Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,





used to be the Professor's favorite line, for “das land” meant Germany to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth and melody, upon the words—





There, oh there, might I with thee,

O, my beloved, go





and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart thither whenever he liked.

The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet; for she had been introduced simply as “my sister”, and no one had called her by her new name since he came. He forgot himself still further when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting—

“My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir. Please remember that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way.”

Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.

“I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will gif me leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here some days.”

He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo; and the mother's voice gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes, for Mrs. March was not so blind to her children's interest as Mrs. Moffat supposed.

“I suspect that is a wise man, ” remarked Mr. March, with placid satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone.

“I know he is a good one, ” added Mrs. March, with decided approval, as she wound up the clock.

“I thought you'd like him, ” was all Jo said, as she slipped away to her bed.

She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to the city, and finally decided that he had been appointed to some great honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the fact. If she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.





CHAPTER 44

MY LORD AND LADY


“PLEASE, MADAM MOTHER, could you lend me my wife for half an hour? The luggage has come, and I've been making hay of Amy's Paris finery, trying to find some things I want, ” said Laurie, coming in the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting in her mother's lap, as if being made “the baby” again.

“Certainly. Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this.” And Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.

“I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it; but I can't get on without my little woman any more than a—”

“Weathercock can without the wind, ” suggested Jo, as he paused for a simile. Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came home.

“Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the time, with only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and I haven't had an easterly spell since I was married. Don't know anything about the north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy, hey, my lady? ”

“Lovely weather so far; I don't know how long it will last, but I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship. Come home, dear, and I'll find your bootjack; I suppose that's what you are rummaging after among my things. Men are so helpless, Mother, ” said Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted her husband.

“What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled? ”asked Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.

“We have our plans. We don't mean to say much about them yet, because we are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to be idle. I'm going into business with a devotion that shall delight Grandfather, and prove to him that I'm not spoiled. I need something of the sort to keep me steady. I'm tired of dawdling, and mean to work like a man.”

“And Amy, what is she going to do? ” asked Mrs. March, well pleased at Laurie's decision and the energy with which he spoke.

“After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet, we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion, the brilliant society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial influence we shall exert over the world at large. That's about it, isn't it, Madame Récamier? ” asked Laurie, with a quizzical look at Amy.

“Time will show. Come away, impertinence, and don't shock my family by calling me names before their faces, ” answered Amy, resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it before she set up a salon as a queen of society.

“How happy those children seem together! ” observed Mr. March, finding it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after the young couple had gone.

“Yes, and I think it will last, ” added Mrs. March, with the restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into port.

“I know it will. Happy Amy! ” And Jo sighed, then smiled brightly as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient push.

Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest about the bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, “Mrs. Laurence.”

“My Lord! ”

“That man intends to marry our Jo! ”

“I hope so, don't you, dear? ”

“Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense of that expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger and a good deal richer.”

“Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded. If they love one another it doesn't matter a particle how old they are nor how poor. Women never should marry for money—”Amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with malicious gravity—

“Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes. If my memory serves me, you once thought it your duty to make a rich match. That accounts, perhaps, for your marrying a good-for-nothing like me.”

“Oh, my dearest boy, don't, don't say that! I forgot you were rich when I said ‘Yes.' I'd have married you if you hadn't a penny, and I sometimes wish you were poor that I might show how much I love you.” And Amy, who was very dignified in public and very fond in private, gave convincing proofs of the truth of her words.

“You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as I tried to be once, do you? It would break my heart if you didn't believe that I'd gladly pull in the same boat with you, even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake.”

“Am I an idiot and a brute? How could I think so, when you refused a richer man for me, and won't let me give you half I want to now, when I have the right? Girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and though I trembled for you at one time, I was not disappointed, for the daughter was true to the mother's teaching. I told Mamma so yesterday, and she looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a million, to be spent in charity. You are not listening to my moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence.” And Laurie paused, for Amy's eyes had an absent look, though fixed upon his face.

“Yes, I am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time. I don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess that I'm prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money. Don't laugh, but your nose is such a comfort to me.”And Amy softly caressed the well-cut feature with artistic satisfaction.

Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never one that suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did laugh at his wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly, “May I ask you a question, dear? ”

“Of course, you may.”

“Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer? ”

“Oh, that's the trouble, is it? I thought there was something in the dimple that didn't quite suit you. Not being a dog in the manger, but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance at Jo's wedding with a heart as light as my heels. Do you doubt it, my darling? ”

Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied. Her little jealous fear vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of love and confidence.

“I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor. Couldn't we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune? ” said Laurie, when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the château garden.

“Jo would find us out, and spoil it all. She is very proud of him, just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing.”

“Bless her dear heart! She won't think so when she has a literary husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins to support. We won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and do them a good turn in spite of themselves. I owe Jo for a part of my education, and she believes in people's paying their honest debts, so I'll get round her in that way.”

“How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it? That was always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving freely, and, thanks to you, the dream has come true.”

“Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we? There's one sort of poverty that I particularly like to help. Out-and-out beggars get taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly, because they won't ask, and people don't dare to offer charity; yet there are a thousand ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend. I must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar; I suppose it's wrong, but I do, though it is harder.”

“Because it takes a gentleman to do it, ” added the other member of the domestic admiration society.

“Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment. But I was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. Splendid fellows, some of them, working like heros, poor and friendless, but so full of courage, patience, and ambition that I was ashamed of myself, and longed to give them a right good lift. Those are people whom it's a satisfaction to help, for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be allowed to serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel to keep the pot boiling; if they haven't, it's a pleasure to comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find it out.”

“Yes, indeed, and there's another class who can't ask, and who suffer in silence. I know something of it, for I belonged to it before you made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid in the old story. Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie, and often have to see youth, health, and precious opportunities go by, just for want of a little help at the right minute. People have been very kind to me; and whenever I see girls struggling along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand and help them, as I was helped.”

“And so you shall, like an angel as you are! ” cried Laurie, resolving, with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow an institution for the express benefit of young women with artistic tendencies. “Rich people have no right to sit down and enjoy themselves, or let their money accumulate for others to waste. It's not half so sensible to leave legacies when one dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive, and enjoy making one's fellow creatures happy with it. We'll have a good time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by giving other people a generous taste. Will you be a little Dorcas, going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and filling it up with good deeds? ”

“With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin, stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your cloak with the beggar.”

“It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it! ”

So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced happily on again, feeling that their pleasant home was more homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes, believing that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery path before them, if they smoothed rough ways for other feet, and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they.





CHAPTER 45

DAISY AND DEMI


I CANNOT FEEL that I have done my duty as humble historian of the March family, without devoting at least one chapter to the two most precious and important members of it. Daisy and Demi had now arrived at years of discretion; for in this fast age babies of three or four assert their rights, and get them, too, which is more than many of their elders do. If there ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes. Of course they were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be shown when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently at twelve months, and at two years they took their places at table, and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders. At three, Daisy demanded a “needler”, and actually made a bag with four stitches in it; she likewise set up housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters with his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and heels. The boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted his father and distracted his mother, for he tried to imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a chaotic condition, with his “sewin-sheen”—a mysterious structure of string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for wheels to go “wound and wound”; also a basket hung over the back of a chair, in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who, with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, “Why, Marmar, dat's my lellywaiter, and me's trying to pull her up.”

Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice a day. Of course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly defended her from every other aggressor, while Daisy made a galley slave of herself, and adored her brother as the one perfect being in the world. A rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and nestled there.One of the captivating children, who seem made to be kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses, and produced for general approval on all festive occasions. Her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully human. It was all fair weather in her world, and every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone, “Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day! ”Everyone was a friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful worshipers.

“Me loves everybody, ” she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world.

As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares. Her grandfather often called her “Beth”, and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could see.

Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual “What for? ”

He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him, in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk.

“What makes my legs go, Dranpa? ” asked the young philosopher, surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air, while resting after a go-to-bed frolic one night.

“It's your little mind, Demi, ” replied the sage, stroking the yellow head respectfully.

“What is a little mine? ”

“It is something which makes your body move, as the spring made the wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you.”

“Open me. I want to see it go wound.”

“I can't do that any more than you could open the watch. God winds you up, and you go till He stops you.”

“Does I? ” And Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought. “Is I wounded up like the watch? ”

“Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't see.”

Demi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of the watch, and then gravely remarked, “I dess Dod does it when I's asleep.”

A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively that his anxious grandmother said, “My dear, do you think it wise to talk about such things to that baby? He's getting great bumps over his eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions.”

“If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to receive true answers. I am not putting the thoughts into his head, but helping him unfold those already there. These children are wiser than we are, and I have no doubt the boy understands every word I have said to him. Now, Demi, tell me where you keep your mind.”

If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, “By the gods, Socrates, I cannot tell, ” his grandfather would not have been surprised; but when, after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young stork, he answered, in a tone of calm conviction, “In my little belly, ” the old gentleman could only join in Grandma's laugh, and dismiss the class in metaphysics.

There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a budding philosopher; for, often, after a discussion which caused Hannah to prophesy, with ominous nods, “That child ain't long for this world, ” he would turn about and set her fears at rest by some of the pranks with which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals distract and delight their parents' souls.

Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what mother was ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious evasions, or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women who so early show themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?

“No more raisins, Demi. They'll make you sick, ” says Mamma to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with unfailing regularity on plum-pudding day.

“Me likes to be sick.”

“I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes.”

He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit, and by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits Mamma by a shrewd bargain.

“Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you like, ”says Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot.

“Truly, Marmar? ” asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered head.

“Yes, truly; anything you say, ” replies the shortsighted parent, preparing herself to sing “The Three Little Kittens” half a dozen times over, or to take her family to “Buy a penny bun, ” regardless of wind or limb. But Demi corners her by the cool reply—

“Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins.”

Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children, and the trio turned the little house topsy-turvy. Aunt Amy was as yet only a name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly vague memory, but Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the most of her, for which compliment she was deeply grateful. But when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo neglected her playfellows, and dismay and desolation fell upon their little souls. Daisy, who was fond of going about peddling kisses, lost her best customer and became bankrupt; Demi, with infantile penetration, soon discovered that Dodo like to play with “the bear-man” better than she did him; but, though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he hadn't the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.

Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes;but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to patronize the “the bear-man” with pensive affability, while Daisy bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts treasures of surpassing worth.

Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard; but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not deceive anybody a particle. Mr. Bhaer's devotion was sincere, however likewise effective—for honesty is the best policy in love as in law; he was one of the men who are at home with children, and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant contrast with his manly one. His business,whatever it was, detained him from day to day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to see—well, he always asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the attraction.The excellent papa labored under the delusion that he was, and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit, till a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened him.

Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the study, astonished by the spectacle that met his eye. Prone upon the floor lay Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him, likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude with his own short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators, till Mr. Bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with a scandalized face—

“Father, Father, here's the Professor! ”

Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor said, with undisturbed dignity, “Good evening, Mr. Bhaer. Excuse me for a moment. We are just finishing our lesson. Now, Demi, make the letter and tell its name.”

“I knows him! ” And, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted, “It's a We, Dranpa, it's a We! ”

“He's a born Weller, ” laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself up, and her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over.

“What have you been at today,bübchen? ”asked Mr.Bhaer,picking up the gymnast.

“Me went to see little Mary.”

“And what did you there? ”

“I kissed her, ” began Demi, with artless frankness.

“Prut! Thou beginnest early. What did the little Mary say to that? ”asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner, who stood upon the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.

“Oh,she liked it,and she kissed me,and I liked it.Don't little boys like little girls? ” asked Demi, with his mouth full, and an air of bland satisfaction.

“You precious chick! Who put that into your head? ” said Jo, enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.

“'Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf, ” answered literal Demi,putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking she alluded to confectionery, not ideas.

“Thou shouldst save some for the little friend: sweets to the sweet, mannling.” And Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. Demi also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy inquired—

“Do great boys like great girls, too, 'Fessor? ”

Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer “couldn't tell a lie, ” so he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes, in a tone that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush, glance at Jo's retiring face, and then sink into his chair, looking as if the ‘precocious chick' had put an idea into his head that was both sweet and sour.

Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an hour afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body with a tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there, and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected gift of a big slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems over which Demi puzzled his small wits, and was forced to leave unsolved forever.





CHAPTER 46

UNDER THE UMBRELLA


WHILE LAURIE and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet carpets, as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful future, Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different sort, along muddy roads and sodden fields.

“I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why I should give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor on his way out, ” said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters, for though there were two paths to Meg's whichever one she took she was sure to meet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her until quite close, when he would look as if his shortsighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment. Then, if she was going to Meg's he always had something for the babies; if her face was turned homeward, he had merely strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless they were tired of his frequent calls.

Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and invite him in? If she was tired of his visits, she concealed her weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee for supper, “as Friedrich—I mean Mr. Bhaer—doesn't like tea.”

By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on, yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in Jo's face. They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise; and no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter lessons in love.

Jo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried to quench her feelings; and, failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated life. She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering, after her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her especial dread; but thanks to the new manager, he behaved with praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer “a capital old fellow” in public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's improved appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's hat on the Marches' hall table nearly every evening. But he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms.

For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like regularity;then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and Jo to become pensive, at first, and then—alas for romance! —very cross.

“Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came. It's nothing to me,of course;but I should think he would have come and bid us good-by like a gentleman, ” she said to herself, with a despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon.

“You'd better take the little umbrella, dear. It looks like rain, ” said her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet, but not alluding to the fact.

“Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town? I've got to run in and get some paper, ” returned Jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother.

“Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon. Have you got your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak? ”

“I believe so, ” answered Jo absently.

“If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea. I quite long to see the dear man, ” added Mrs. March.

Jo heard that,but made no answer,except to kiss her mother,and walk rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her heartache,“How good she is to me!What do girls do who haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles? ”

The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks, and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate;but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand, loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another, with most unfeminine interest; tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered “how the deuce she got there.” A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons; for the drops continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she felt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her bonnet. Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing, and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. She looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked with black, forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with “Hoffmann, Swartz, & Co.” over the door, and said to herself, with a sternly reproachful air—

“It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my best things and come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor? Jo, I'm ashamed of you! No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain, and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet, it's no more than you deserve. Now then! ”

With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, “I beg pardon, ma'am, ” and looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself, spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and putting temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down.

“I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely under many horse noses, and so fast through much mud. What do you down here, my friend? ”

“I'm shopping.”

Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he only said politely, “You haf no umbrella. May I go also, and take for you the bundles? ”

“Yes, thank you.”

Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought of her, but she didn't care, for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day.

“We thought you had gone, ” said Jo hastily, for she knew he was looking at her. Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face, and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.

“Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those who haf been so heavenly kind to me? ” he asked so reproachfully that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and answered heartily—

“No, I didn't. I knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we rather missed you—Father and Mother especially.”

“And you? ”

“I'm always glad to see you, sir.”

In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely—

“I thank you, and come one more time before I go.”

“You are going,then? ”

“I haf no longer any business here, it is done.”

“Successfully, I hope? ” said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his.

“I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which I can make my bread and gif my Jünglings much help.”

“Tell me, please! I like to know all about the—the boys, ” said Jo eagerly.

“That is so kind, I gladly tell you. My friends find for me a place in a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way smooth for Franz and Emil. For this I should be grateful, should I not? ”

“Indeed you should. How splendid it will be to have you doing what you like, and be able to see you often, and the boys! ” cried Jo, clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction she could not help betraying.

“Ah! But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at the West.”

“So far away! ” And Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if it didn't matter now what became of her clothes or herself.

Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not learned to read women yet. He flattered himself that he knew Jo pretty well, and was, therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour. When she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose. When he offered her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight; but when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell upon him. On learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands. Was the joy all for the boys? Then on hearing his destination, she said, “So far away! ” in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter—

“Here's the place for my errands. Will you come in? It won't take long.”

Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. But owing to the flutter she was in, everything went amiss; she upset the tray of needles, forgot the silesia was to be “twilled” till it was cut off, gave the wrong change, and covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon at the calico counter. Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women, like dreams, go by contraries.

When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with a more cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if he rather enjoyed it on the whole.

“Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the babies, and haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last call at your so pleasant home? ” he asked, stopping before a window full of fruit and flowers.

“What will we buy? ” asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of his speech, and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation of delight as they went in.

“May they haf oranges and figs? ” asked Mr. Bhaer, with a paternal air.

“They eat them when they can get them.”

“Do you care for nuts? ”

“Like a squirrel.”

“Hamburg grapes; yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in those? ”

Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why he didn't buy a frail of dates, a cask of raisins, and a bag of almonds, and done with it? Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own, and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a demijohn. Then, distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and giving her the flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they traveled on again.

“Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you, ” began the Professor, after a moist promenade of half a block.

“Yes, sir? ” And Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was afraid he would hear it.

“I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short a time remains to me.”

“Yes, sir.” And Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it.

“I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid to go alone. Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help? ”

“Yes, sir.” And Jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator.

“Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick, and the husband is such a care. Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl would be a friendly thing to take the little mother.”

“I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer. I'm going very fast, and he's getting dearer every minute, ” added Jo to herself, then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to behold.

Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for Tina, and then ordered out the shawls. The clerk, being a married man, condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared to be shopping for their family.

“Your lady may prefer this. It's a superior article, a most desirable color, quite chaste and genteel, ” he said, shaking out a comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.

“Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer? ” she asked, turning her back to him, and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding her face.

“Excellently well, we will haf it, ” answered the Professor, smiling to himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to rummage the counters like a confirmed bargain-hunter.

“Now shall we go home? ” he asked, as if the words were very pleasant to him.

“Yes, it's late, and I'm so tired.” Jo's voice was more pathetic than she knew. For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and that her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the latter. Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend, it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better. With this idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.

“This is not our omniboos, ” said the Professor, waving the loaded vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little flowers.

“I beg your pardon. I didn't see the name distinctly. Never mind, I can walk. I'm used to plodding in the mud, ” returned Jo, winking hard, because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes.

Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her head away. The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, “Heart's dearest, why do you cry? ”

Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine fib proper to the occasion. Instead of which that undignified creature answered, with an irrepressible sob, “Because you are going away.”

“Ach,mein Gott,that is so goot! ”cried Mr.Bhaer,managing to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles. “Jo, I haf nothing but much love to gif you; I came to see if you could care for it, and I waited to be sure that I was something more than a friend. Am I? Can you make a little place in your heart for old Fritz? ” he added, all in one breath.

“Oh, yes! ” said Jo; and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him, even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he carried it.

It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on account of the mud; neither could he offer Jo his hand, except figuratively, for both were full; much less could he indulge in tender demonstrations in the open street, though he was near it; so the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard. If he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have done it then,for she looked far from lovely,with her skirts in a deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her bonnet a ruin. Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living, and she found him more “Jove-like” than ever, though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed mending.

Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics, for they entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled leisurely along, oblivious of deepening dusk and fog. Little they cared what anybody thought, for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss; while Jo trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first to speak—intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous “Oh, yes! ” were not of a coherent or reportable character.

“Friedrich, why didn't you—”

“Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since Minna died! ” cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard her with grateful delight.

“I always call you so to myself—I forgot; but I won't unless you like it.”

“Like it? It is more sweet to me than I can tell. Say ‘thou', also, and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine.”

“Isn't ‘thou' a little sentimental? ” asked Jo, privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable.

“Sentimental? Yes. Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment, and keep ourselves young mit it. Your English ‘you' is so cold, say ‘thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me, ” pleaded Mr. Bhaer, more like a romantic student than a grave professor.

“Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner? ” asked Jo bashfully.

“Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly will, because thou must take care of it hereafter. See, then, my Jo—ah, the dear, funny little name—I had a wish to tell something the day I said goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee, and so I spoke not.Wouldst thou have said‘Yes',then,if I had spoken? ”

“I don't know. I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just then.”

“Prut! That I do not believe. It was asleep till the fairy prince came through the wood,and waked it up.Ah,well,‘Die erste Liebe ist die beste, ' but that I should not expect.”

“Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I never had another. Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy, ” said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's mistake.

“Good! Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest me all. I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt find, Professorin.”

“I like that, ” cried Jo, delighted with her new name. “Now tell me what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you? ”

“This.” And Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his waistcoat pocket.

Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt.

“How could that bring you? ” she asked, wondering what he meant.

“I found it by chance; I knew it by the names and the initials, and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me. Read and find him. I will see that you go not in the wet.”

Jo obeyed, and hastily skimmed through the lines which she had christened—





IN THE GARRET





Four little chests all in a row,

Dim with dust, and worn by time,

All fashioned and filled, long ago,

By children now in their prime.

Four little keys hung side by side,

With faded ribbons, brave and gay

When fastened there, with childish pride,

Long ago, on a rainy day.

Four little names, one on each lid,

Carved out by a boyish hand,

And underneath there lieth hid

Histories of the happy band

Once playing here, and pausing oft

To hear the sweet refrain,

That came and went on the roof aloft,

In the falling summer rain.





“Meg” on the first lid, smooth and fair.

I look in with loving eyes,

For folded here, with well-known care,

A goodly gathering lies,

The record of a peaceful life—

Gifts to gentle child and girl,

A bridal gown, lines to a wife,

A tiny shoe, a baby curl.

No toys in this first chest remain,

For all are carried away,

In their old age, to join again

In another small Meg's play.

Ah, happy mother! well I know

You hear, like a sweet refrain,

Lullabies ever soft and low

In the falling summer rain.





“Jo” on the next lid, scratched and worn,

And within a motley store

Of headless dolls, of schoolbooks torn,

Birds and beasts that speak no more;

Spoils brought home from the fairy ground

Only trod by youthful feet,

Dreams of a future never found,

Memories of a past still sweet;

Half-writ poems, stories wild,

April letters, warm and cold,

Diaries of a wilful child,

Hints of a woman early old;

A woman in a lonely home,

Hearing, like a sad refrain—

“Be worthy, love, and love will come, ”

In the falling summer rain.





My Beth! the dust is always swept

From the lid that bears your name,

As if by loving eyes that wept,

By careful hands that often came.

Death canonized for us one saint,

Ever less human than divine,

And still we lay, with tender plaint,

Relics in this household shrine—

The silver bell, so seldom rung,

The little cap which last she wore,

The fair, dead Catherine that hung

By angels borne above her door;

The songs she sang, without lament,

In her prison-house of pain,

Forever are they sweetly blent

With the falling summer rain.





Upon the last lid's polished field—

Legend now both fair and true

A gallant knight bears on his shield,

“Amy” in letters gold and blue.

Within lie snoods that bound her hair,

Slippers that have danced their last,

Faded flowers laid by with care,

Fans whose airy toils are past,

Gay valentines, all ardent flames,

Trifles that have borne their part

In girlish hopes and fears and shames,

The record of a maiden heart

Now learning fairer, truer spells,

Hearing, like a blithe refrain,

The silver sound of bridal bells

In the falling summer rain.





Four little chests all in a row,

Dim with dust, and worn by time,

Four women, taught by weal and woe

To love and labor in their prime.

Four sisters, parted for an hour,

None lost, one only gone before,

Made by love's immortal power,

Nearest and dearest evermore.

Oh, when these hidden stores of ours

Lie open to the Father's sight,

May they be rich in golden hours,

Deeds that show fairer for the light,

Lives whose brave music long shall ring,

Like a spirit-stirring strain,

Souls that shall gladly soar and sing

In the long sunshine after rain.





“It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day when I was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag. I never thought it would go where it could tell tales, ” said Jo, tearing up the verses the Professor had treasured so long.

“Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets, ” said Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind. “Yes, ” he added earnestly, “I read that, and I think to myself, She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would find comfort in true love. I haf a heart full, full for her;shall I not go and say, ‘If this is not too poor a thing to gif for what I shall hope to receive, take it in Gott's name? '”

“And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one precious thing I needed, ” whispered Jo.

“I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was your welcome to me. But soon I began to hope, and then I said, ‘I will haf her if I die for it, ' and so I will! ” cried Mr. Bhaer, with a defiant nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down.

Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight, though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.

“What made you stay away so long? ” she asked presently, finding it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful answers that she could not keep silent.

“It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you from that so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to give you, after much time, perhaps, and hard work. How could I ask you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune but a little learning? ”

“I'm glad you are poor; I couldn't bear a rich husband, ”said Jo decidedly, adding, in a softer tone, “Don't fear poverty. I've known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working for those I love; and don't call yourself old—forty is the prime of life. I couldn't help loving you if you were seventy! ”

The Professor found that so touching that he would have been glad of his handkerchief, if he could have got at it; as he couldn't, Jo wiped his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she took away a bundle or two—

“I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my sphere now, for woman's special mission is supposed to be drying tears and bearing burdens. I'm to carry my share, Friedrich, and help to earn the home. Make up your mind to that, or I'll never go, ” she added resolutely, as he tried to reclaim his load.

“We shall see. Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo? I must go away and do my work alone. I must help my boys first, because, even for you, I may not break my word to Minna. Can you forgif that, and be happy while we hope and wait? ”

“Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes all the rest easy to bear. I have my duty, also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you, so there's no need of hurry or impatience. You can do your part out West, I can do mine here, and both be happy hoping for the best, and leaving the future to be as God wills.”

“Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands, ” cried the Professor, quite overcome.

Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said that as they stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into his, whispering tenderly, “Not empty now, ” and, stooping down, kissed her Friedrich under the umbrella. It was dreadful, but she would have done it if the flock of draggle-tailed sparrows on the hedge had been human beings, for she was very far gone indeed, and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness. Though it came in such a very simple guise, that was the crowning moment of both their lives, when, turning from the night and storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace waiting to receive them, with a glad “Welcome home! ” Jo led her lover in, and shut the door.





CHAPTER 47

HARVEST TIME


FOR A YEAR Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped and loved, met occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for, Laurie said. The second year began rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March died suddenly. But when their first sorrow was over—for they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue—they found they had cause for rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of joyful things possible.

“It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for of course you intend to sell it, ” said Laurie, as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later.

“No, I don't, ” was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the fat poodle, whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former mistress.

“You don't mean to live there? ”

“Yes, I do.”

“But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a power of money to keep it in order. The garden and orchard alone need two or three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take it.”

“He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it.”

“And you expect to live on the produce of the place? Well, that sounds paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work.”

“The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one.” And Jo laughed.

“Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am? ”

“Boys. I want to open a school for little lads—a good, happy, homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz to teach them.”

“That's a truly Joian plan for you! Isn't that just like her? ” cried Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much surprised as he.

“I like it, ” said Mrs. March decidedly.

“So do I, ” added her husband, who welcomed the thought of a chance for trying the Socratic method of education on modern youth.

“It will be an immense care for Jo, ” said Meg, stroking the head of her one all-absorbing son.

“Jo can do it, and be happy in it. It's a splendid idea. Tell us all about it, ” cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing to lend the lovers a hand, but knew that they would refuse his help.

“I knew you'd stand by me, sir. Amy does too—I see it in her eyes, though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind before she speaks. Now, my dear people, ” continued Jo earnestly, “just understand that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long cherished plan. Before my Fritz came, I used to think how, when I'd made my fortune, and no one needed me at home, I'd hire a big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn little lads who hadn't any mothers, and take care of them, and make life jolly for them before it was too late. I see so many going to ruin for want of help at the right minute, I love so to do anything for them, I seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and oh, I should so like to be a mother to them! ”

Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling, with tears in her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way, which they had not seen for a long while.

“I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what he would like, and agreed to try it when we got rich. Bless his dear heart, he's been doing it all his life—helping poor boys, I mean, not getting rich; that he'll never be; money doesn't stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any. But now, thanks to my good old aunt, who loved me better than I ever deserved, I'mrich,at least I feel so,and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well,if we have a flourishing school. It's just the place for boys, the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain. There's plenty of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside. They could help in the garden and orchard:such work is healthy, isn't it, sir? Then Fritz could train and teach in his own way, and Father will help him. I can feed and nurse and pet and scold them, and Mother will be my stand-by. I've always longed for lots of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and revel in the little dears to my heart's content. Think what luxury— Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me! ”

As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till they thought he'd have an apoplectic fit.

“I don't see anything funny, ” she said gravely, when she could be heard. “Nothing could be more natural and proper than for my Professor to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside in my own estate.”

“She is putting on airs already, ” said Laurie, who regarded the idea in the light of a capital joke. “But may I inquire how you intend to support the establishment? If all the pupils are little ragamuffins, I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in a worldly sense, Mrs. Bhaer.”

“Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy. Of course I shall have rich pupils, also—perhaps begin with such altogether. Then, when I've got a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just for a relish. Rich people's children often need care and comfort, as well as poor. I've seen unfortunate little creatures left to servants, or backward ones pushed forward, when it's real cruelty. Some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect, and some lose their mothers. Besides, the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that's the very time they need most patience and kindness. People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men. They don't complain much—plucky little souls—but they feel it. I've been through something of it, and I know all about it. I've a special interest in such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm, honest, well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms and legs and the topsy-turvy heads. I've had experience, too, for haven't I brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family? ”

“I'll testify that you tried to do it, ” said Laurie with a grateful look.

“And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a steady, sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves,as you always did in the old times.I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone feels it, though you won't let them say so. Yes, and when I have my flock, I'll just point to you, and say ‘There's your model, my lads.'”

Poor Laurie didn't know where to look; for, man though he was, something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him.

“I say, Jo, that's rather too much, ” he began, just in his old boyish way.“You have all done more for me than I can ever thank you for, except by doing my best not to disappoint you. You have rather cast me off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help, nevertheless; so, if I've got on at all, you may thank these two for it.” And he laid one hand gently on his grandfather's head, and the other on Amy's golden one, for the three were never far apart.

“I do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world! ”burst out Jo, who was in an unusually uplifted frame of mind just then.“When I have one of my own, I hope it will be as happy as the three I know and love the best. If John and my Fritz were only here, it would be quite a little heaven on earth, ” she added more quietly. And that night when she went to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels, hopes, and plans, her heart was so full of happiness that she could only calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own, and thinking tender thoughts of Beth.

It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner. Almost before she knew where she was, Jo found herself married and settled at Plumfield. Then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich; for Mr. Laurence was continually finding some touching case of destitution, and begging the Bhaers to take pity on the child, and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support. In this way, the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, and furnished her with the style of boy in which she most delighted.

Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer mistakes, but the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. How Jo did enjoy her “wilderness of boys”, and how poor, dear Aunt March would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered Plumfield overrun with Toms, Dicks, and Harrys! There was a sort of poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around; and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved, and played cricket in the big field where the irritable “cow with a crumpled horn”used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. It became a sort of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested that it should be called the “Bhaer-garten”, as a compliment to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants.

It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not lay up a fortune; but it was just what Jo intended it to be—“a happy, homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and kindness.” Every room in the big house was soon full; every little plot in the garden soon had its owner. A regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet animals were allowed;and, three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz from the head of a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces, which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding words, and grateful hearts, full of love for “Mother Bhaer”. She had boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not angels, by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and Professorin much trouble and anxiety. But her faith in the good spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in time success, for no mortal boy could hold out long with Father Bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer forgiving him seventy times seven. Very precious to Jo was the friendship of the lads, their penitent sniffs and whispers after wrongdoing; their droll or touching little confidences, their pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans; even their misfortunes, for they only endeared them to her all the more. There were slow boys and bashful boys; feeble boys and riotous boys, boys that lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones; and a merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but who was welcome to the “Bhaer-garten”, though some people predicted that his admission would ruin the school.

Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work, much anxiety, and a perpetual racket. She enjoyed it heartily and found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of the world, for now she told no stories except to her flock of enthusiastic believers and admirers. As the years went on, two little lads of her own came to increase her happiness—Rob, named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed to have inherited his papa's sunshiny temper as well as his mother's lively spirit. How they ever grew up alive in that whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts, but they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough nurses loved and served them well.

There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of the most delightful was the yearly apple-picking; for then the Marches, Laurences, Brookes and Bhaers turned out in full force and made a day of it. Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these fruitful festivals occurred—a mellow October day, when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins. The old orchard wore its holiday attire: goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls; grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped like fairy pipers at a feast; squirrels were busy with their small harvesting. Birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane; and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake. Everybody was there; everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled down; everybody declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such a jolly set to enjoy it; and everyone gave themselves up to the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no such things as care or sorrow in the world.

Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley, and Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying—





The gentle apple's winey juice.





The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling. Laurie devoted himself to the little ones, rode his small daughter in a bushelbasket, took Daisy up among the birds' nests, and kept adventurous Rob from breaking his neck. Mrs. March and Meg sat among the apple-piles like a pair of Pomonas, sorting the contributions that kept pouring in, while Amy with a beautiful motherly expression in her face sketched the various groups, and watched over one pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him.

Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her gown pinned up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her baby tucked under her arm, ready for any lively adventure which might turn up. Little Teddy bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa, who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small shoes. She knew that little Ted would turn up again in time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.

At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained empty, while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and bruises. Then Jo and Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day. The land literally flowed with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads were not required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of refreshment as they liked—freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish soul. They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. The little girls had a private tea party, and Ted roved among the edibles at his own sweet will.

When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the first regular toast, which was always drunk at such times—“Aunt March, God bless her! ” A toast heartily given by the good man, who never forgot how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the boys, who had been taught to keep her memory green.

“Now, Grandma's sixtieth birthday! Long life to her, with three times three! ”

That was given with a will, as you may well believe; and the cheering once begun, it was hard to stop it. Everybody's health was proposed, from Mr. Laurence, who was considered their special patron, to the astonished guinea pig, who had strayed from its proper sphere in search of its young master. Demi, as the oldest grandchild, then presented the queen of the day with various gifts, so numerous that they were transported to the festive scene in a wheelbarrow. Funny presents, some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to Grandma's—for the children's gifts were all their own. Every stitch Daisy's patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs she hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March; Demi's shoebox was a miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut; Rob's footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was soothing; and no page of the costly book Amy's child gave her was so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words—“To dear Grandma, from her little Beth.”

During the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared; and when Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken down, while Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor suddenly began to sing. Then, from above him, voice after voice took up the words, and from tree to tree echoed the music of the unseen choir, as the boys sang with all their hearts the little song that Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and the Professor trained his lads to give with the best effect. This was something altogether new, and it proved a grand success; for Mrs. March couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.

After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs. March and her daughters under the festival tree.

“I don't think I ever ought to call myself ‘unlucky Jo' again, when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified, ” said Mrs. Bhaer, taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which he was rapturously churning.

“And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago. Do you remember our castles in the air? ” asked Amy, smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.

“Dear fellows! It does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day, ” answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind. “Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then seems selfish, lonely, and cold to me now. I haven't given up the hope that I may write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations as these.” And Jo pointed from the lively lads in the distance to her father, leaning on the Professor's arm, as they walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one of the conversations which both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother, sitting enthroned among her daughters, with their children in her lap and at her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which never could grow old to them.

“My castle was the most nearly realized of all. I asked for splendid things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be satisfied, if I had a little home, and John, and some dear children like these. I've got them all, thank God, and am the happiest woman in the world.” And Meg laid her hand on her tall boy's head, with a face full of tender and devout content.

“My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would not alter it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic hopes, or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of beauty. I've begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says it is the best thing I've ever done. I think so, myself, and mean to do it in marble, so that, whatever happens, I may at least keep the image of my little angel.”

As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over Amy's sunshine. This cross was doing much for both father and mother, for one love and sorrow bound them closely together. Amy's nature was growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender; Laurie was growing more serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blessed for —





Into each life some rain must fall,

Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.





“She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear. Don't despond, but hope and keep happy, ” said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted Daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against her little cousin's pale one.

“I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee, and Laurie to take more than half of every burden, ” replied Amy warmly.“He never lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and patient with me, so devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort to me always that I can't love him enough. So, in spite of my one cross, I can say with Meg, ‘Thank God, I'm a happy woman.'”

“There's no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that I'm far happier than I deserve, ” added Jo, glancing from her good husband to her chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her. “Fritz is getting gray and stout; I'm growing as thin as a shadow, and am thirty; we never shall be rich, and Plumfield may burn up any night, for that incorrigible Tommy Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under the bedclothes,though he's set himself afire three times already. But in spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain of, and never was so jolly in my life. Excuse the remark, but living among boys, I can't help using their expressions now and then.”

“Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one, ” began Mrs. March, frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of countenance.

“Not half so good as yours, Mother. Here it is, and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done, ” cried Jo, with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow.

“I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every year, ” said Amy softly.

“A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for it, Marmee dear, ” added Meg's tender voice.

Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out her arms, as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself, and say, with face and voice full of motherly love, gratitude, and humility—

“Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this! ”
