特斯拉自传

译序


爱迪生和爱因斯坦的大名如雷贯耳，在全世界几乎家喻户晓，而特斯拉一直不为世人关注。但特斯拉的科学成就远远高于前两位，他的十大发明彻底改变了人类的生活和认知，对他所处的那个时代以及现在都产生了不可估量的影响，甚至还会影响到世界的未来。由于他的发明和构想过于超前，所以不能被当时的一些人理解，遭到了所谓的“正统科学”的排斥，他的许多观点被斥为“异端邪说”。可是随着社会的进步和科学的发展，他的构想现今已一一变为现实。无论是海里的潜艇、天上的无人机、街上跑的特斯拉电动汽车以及即将风靡世界的无人驾驶汽车和机器人，还是家家户户都在用的交流电，无一不脱胎于他的发明，或者与他的构想有着千丝万缕的联系。这样一个伟大的科学家，理应获得诺贝尔奖——诺贝尔奖的评委们也是这么想的。可是他居功不傲，11次把获奖机会让给了别人。纵观诺贝尔物理学奖的历史，受他的直接启发从而获奖的科学家占了27％，受他的间接启发从而获奖的人数竟占了65％还多。尽管他从不接受诺贝尔奖，但他在过75岁生日时，收到了8封诺贝尔物理学奖获得者的感谢信。

本书是特斯拉的自传，叙述了他极具传奇色彩的人生经历——有些经历过于“传奇”，可能会给人以“匪夷所思”之感，但它们是确实存在的，并因此产生了“传奇”的发明创造。1856年7月10日，尼古拉·特斯拉在克罗地亚出生，父母都是塞尔维亚人。父亲是个牧师，在这一行干得风生水起，颇有名气，还精通物理学，在文学方面亦出类拔萃，是个妙笔生花的诗人。母亲出身于一个热爱发明的家族，无时无刻不在展现她的天赋，发明了许多奇特的家用品。

少年时期，特斯拉的脑海里经常出现一些影像，还伴有强烈的闪光，使他看不清实物，干扰了他的思维和行动。他咨询过生理学和心理学的学者，但无一人能对这些现象做出令人满意的解释。后来他发现可以充分利用自己这种超凡的想象能力，不需要模型，不需要绘图，也不需要实验，单凭想象就能够进行发明创造。他一旦有了想法，就会立刻在脑海里构图，并对其结构进行修改和完善，其间不接触任何实物，直到将所能想到的一切的合理改进都完成，再也找不出缺陷时，他才会把在脑海里最终形成的产物转化为实物。他的这种“特异功能”20年来从未出现过一次偏差，在工程、电气和机械方面的设计和发明全都取得了很好的效果。正是由于这种“特异功能”，他能在遇到危险时化险为夷。一次在河里游泳，河水突然上涨，威胁到了他的生命。就在这时，他的脑海里出现了一道闪光和一幅逃生图，使他得以躲过了一劫。

特斯拉自小就喜欢鼓捣“小发明”，由于思维方式与普通人不同，他经常有惊人之举。例如，他发明的“钓蛙器”使当地的青蛙几乎遭到了“灭顶之灾”；他的“灭虫器”和自制玩具枪也颇有创意。他的家乡有一位商人购置了一辆崭新的消防车并组织了一支消防队，这位商人还给每位消防队员发了一套制服，指挥消防队训练，准备举行一个检阅仪式。所谓消防车其实就是一个水泵，由16名队员操作。一天下午，消防车被拉到了河边，准备举行正式的检阅仪式。人们倾城而出，赶来看这一盛景。演讲和典礼仪式结束后，一声令下，消防队员开始喷水，可是喷嘴里一滴水也喷不出来。教授和专家们群策群力，却找不出哪里出了毛病。特斯拉赶到现场时，人们正急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。当时他在机械原理方面的知识为零，也不懂得什么空气压力，却本能地感到是水下的抽水管出了问题，抽水管可能堵住了。于是他涉水打通了堵塞处，消防车的喷嘴便突然喷出了水。他被人们扛在肩头游行，一下子成了英雄。

特斯拉上学的时候对物理学研究着了迷，可是父母一心一意想让他将来当牧师。一想到这一点，他心里就发怵。一次放假回到家乡，他不幸染上了霍乱，生命垂危，眼看无药可救。父亲心如刀绞，却束手无策。他对父亲说：“如果你同意我学习工程技术，也许我能恢复健康。”父亲听了，郑重地向他许诺：“我要让你上天下最好的工学院。”后来不知怎的，他病情突然好转，竟从死神的手中挣脱了出来。假期结束后，他被送到了奥地利施蒂里亚州格拉茨市的理工学院学习——那是一所历史悠久、声名卓著的大学，是他父亲专门为他挑选的。他悬梁刺股，每天凌晨3点起床，一直学到夜里11点，星期天和节假日也不例外，结果在各个科目上都拔得头筹。除了自己的专业，他还博览文学方面的书籍。一次读到托尔斯泰的书，他“诧异地发现那个‘怪才’靠一天喝72杯黑咖啡竟然写了近100卷的东西，每一卷的字都密密麻麻”！他和托尔斯泰“较劲”，直至将他的全部著作都看完才罢手。他痴迷于文学，不但借此陶冶情操，还觉得文学作品有治病的功效。一次，他大病一场，情况非常危急，可是看了马克·吐温的几部作品后，竟忘掉了自己危重的病情，最终恢复了健康。25年后，他结识了马克·吐温，把这段往事讲给马克·吐温听，惹得马克·吐温哈哈大笑，把眼泪都笑出来了。

特斯拉十分关心世界形势，热切盼望不再发生战争，实现全世界和平。他认为：“战争是不可避免的，除非引发战争的物质因素得以消除——归根结底，这种物质因素在这个我们赖以生存的星球上是普遍存在的。只有通过消除信息传递、旅客运输、能源供应和输送等各方面的差异，才能有朝一日消除战争，使人与人之间永久地保持友好的关系。我们热切盼望全世界的人与人、国与国之间都能加强联系，增进了解，消除狂热的极端思想和自私的民粹主义，因为历来都是这些因素在兴风作浪，让世界陷入原始的野蛮状态，使得冲突不断。”

特斯拉晚年十分不幸。由于病痛和精神的折磨，他变得性格古怪，经常徘徊于纽约公园，给那儿的野鸽子喂食。1943年1月7日，穷困潦倒的特斯拉在纽约的一家旅馆孤独地离开了人世，享年86岁。翻开这本书，你可以了解许多鲜为人知的秘密以及奇异的现象，从而能客观地看待这位科学巨人……

第一章　早年的人生


人类社会的发展和进步主要依赖于发明创造，而发明创造是人类富有创造力的大脑最重要的产物。发明创造最根本的目的在于利用自然力满足人类的需求，用智慧掌控物质世界。这是一项艰巨的使命——发明家往往会遭到误解，得不到回报。不过，发明家会得到巨大的补偿，因为他们的能力可喜地有了用武之地，他们知道自己会跻身于特殊的精英群体中。没有这样的群体，在和残酷的大自然的激烈搏斗过程中，人类恐怕早已从地球上消失了。

至于我自己，我从发明创造中收获了无与伦比的兴奋和喜悦，多年来我的生活一直不乏欢乐的成分。有人称赞我是一个极为勤奋的人——如果这指的是思维方面的劳动，那么我当之无愧，因为除了睡眠我几乎把所有的时间都用于思考问题了。但是，如果“劳动”指的是在特定的时间，按特定的规则完成某项任务的活动，那我就是最懒散的人了。但凡强迫性的劳动必定会耗费生命的能量，我却从未为此付出过代价。恰恰相反，我在思考中获益匪浅。

我试图通过系列文章连贯而忠实地记述自己所从事的工作，并在《电气实验者》(1)编辑的帮助下将它们发表于该杂志，阅读群体主要为年轻读者。因而，不管愿不愿意，我都必须讲述一下自己年轻时候的想法、生活环境以及发生的事件——这些决定了我以后的生活。

人们在小的时候，行为处世往往喜欢冲动，想象力如脱缰的野马般无拘无束。随着年龄的增长，一个人会趋于理性，做事越来越有条不紊、计划周密。然而，正是这种早年的“冲动”，虽然不会立竿见影，即刻给我们带来好处，却是一种极为重要的因素，也许可以决定我们未来的命运。说实在的，我觉得如果当年自己能够理解和培养而非压抑那种“冲动”，以后肯定会为世界做出更大的贡献，留下一份有价值的遗产。可是，直到成年之后，我才意识到自己原来是个发明家。

这种情况是由多种原因造成的。首先，我有一个天才的哥哥，他天赋异禀，智力世间罕有——生物学无法解释。他的英年早逝让我的父母郁郁寡欢。我们家有一匹马，一匹血统高贵的阿拉伯纯种马，是一位好友送的。它几乎跟人一样聪明，曾经在一个危急时刻救过父亲的命，所以备受全家人的关心和宠爱。那是一个寒冷的冬夜，父亲应邀去做一次紧急祈祷。在狼群出没的群山里，那匹马突然受惊，撒腿就跑，把父亲重重地摔在了地上。它跑回家时，浑身是血，已累得精疲力竭。可是，给家人报告过险情之后，它立刻就冲了出去，返回到事发地。在搜救的人群离得还很远的时候，父亲就迎了过来——他又恢复了知觉，骑在了马背上，全然不知自己在雪地里躺了好几个小时。正是这匹马摔伤了我的哥哥，使得他英年早逝。我目睹了那场悲剧的发生，虽然过了56年仍记忆犹新，每个细节都历历在目。回忆起他所取得的成就，我的小小所得与之相比简直微不足道。

无论我做什么事情，做得多好，都只会让父母更加怀念我的哥哥。所以，我小的时候十分缺乏自信。不过，从那时候发生的一件事来看（那件事我至今仍记得一清二楚），我绝对不能算是一个笨孩子。有一天，我正和一群孩子在街上玩，几个受人尊敬的市参议员走了过来。这群绅士中的一位年龄最长的有钱人停住脚步，要给我们每人一枚银币。他来到我面前时，突然跟我说：“看着我的眼睛。”我照他说的做了，同时把手伸过去，准备领取那枚珍贵的银币。让我失望的是，他说：“没门，你别想从我这儿得到一分钱，因为你太聪明了。”

还有一件关于我的趣事，总是被人们津津乐道。我有两个姑姑，脸都皱得像老树皮一样。其中的一个姑姑长着两颗龅牙，龇出来如象牙一般，她每次亲我时它们都会扎进我脸上的肉里。当时我最怕被这两个充满爱心的丑亲戚拥抱。一天，母亲把我抱在怀里，两个姑姑问我她们两个谁更好看。我先是把她俩的脸仔细打量了一番，然后指着其中的一个，以深思熟虑的语气说：“这个不比那个更丑。”

自打我呱呱坠地，家里就准备让我将来当牧师，这种想法一直给我很大的压力。我渴望当一名工程师，但父亲固执己见，寸步不让。我的祖父是军官，曾在拿破仑大帝的军队里服役，他还有个兄弟是一名数学教授，执教于一所著名学府。他们都接受过军事教育，可奇怪的是，父亲竟然爱上了牧师这一行，而且干得风生水起。父亲是个博闻强记的才子，不仅是牧师，也是名副其实的物理学家、诗人和作家。据说，他布道时口若悬河，与亚伯拉罕·阿·桑克塔·克拉拉(2)只在伯仲之间。他记忆力惊人，经常用不同种类的语言背诵大段经文。他曾经开玩笑说，假如某些经文遗失，他可以凭记忆默写出来，还原它们。在写作方面，他的风格颇受推崇，词句简洁明快，力透纸背，充满了智慧和讽刺。他说话诙谐幽默、妙语连珠，总是那么别致、独具特色。关于这一点，我举两个例子，从中可窥见一斑。我们家有个叫马尼的仆人是斗鸡眼，他是被雇来干农活的。一天，他挥动斧头劈柴的时候，家父就站在他跟前，心里感到十分不安，于是提醒他说：“看在上帝的分上，马尼，千万别砍你眼睛看到的，而应该砍你心里想砍的！”还有一次，他驾马车和一个朋友外出，那位朋友不小心把自己昂贵的皮大衣蹭在了车轮上。父亲提醒他说：“把你的衣服往上提提，别把我的车轮蹭坏了。”家父有个怪习惯，喜欢自言自语，经常自己跟自己说话，慷慨激昂，还以不同的声音展开唇枪舌剑般的辩论。如果有谁在外边碰巧听见，会以为屋里有好几个人呢。

虽然必须承认，正是受了母亲的影响我才有了发明创造的能力，但父亲对我的训练也功不可没。这种训练包罗万象，其中有猜度人的心理，找出别人仪容或言语上的毛病，复述冗长的句子和进行心算等。这些日常的训练项目，用意在于加强我的记忆力和推理的能力，尤其是为了提高我的鉴别力，这无疑使我获益匪浅。

我母亲出身于乡下的一个极为古老的世家，家族里曾经出过好几位发明家。她的父亲和祖父为了方便家用，发明了许多工具，有农用的，也有其他用途的。母亲是一位真正的伟大女性，具有非凡的能力，勇敢坚韧，经历过无数磨难，敢于面对生活中的风风雨雨。她16岁那年，一场致命的瘟疫席卷了她的家乡。一次，她的父亲被叫去为一位垂死的人主持最后的圣事。父亲走后，她独自一人去帮助一户邻居——那户人家也染上了这种致命的瘟疫。那户人家共有五口人，一个接一个死去。她为逝者沐浴更衣，把他们的遗体摆放整齐，根据当地的习俗用鲜花加以点缀。待父亲归来，她已把所有的准备工作做完，只等着举行基督徒葬礼了。家母是位不同凡响的发明家。要不是与现代社会隔绝，没有那么多的机遇，我坚信她一定会有惊人的发明。她发明和制作过各种各样的工具及设备，用自纺的棉线织出过精美的图案，甚至还亲自播种，培育植物，从中提取纤维。她每天从拂晓时分忙到深夜，不知疲倦地操持家务——我们家里人穿的衣服以及用的家具，大多是她劳动的结晶。年逾花甲时，她仍心灵手巧，能够在一根眼睫毛上打三个结。

我之所以一直未能觉察出自己在发明方面的天分，还有一个更为重要的原因。少年时期，我的脑海里常常出现一些影像，还伴有强烈的闪光，它们模糊了我的视线，使我看不清实物，干扰了我的思维和行动，让我深受困扰。那些影像都是我亲眼见过的画面和场景，并非臆想出来的。当我听到别人说某个词时，我的眼前就会清清楚楚地浮现那个词所指代的影像，以致我有时都无法判断出现在自己眼前的事物是真实的还是仅为幻象。我为此而感到极度不安，忧心忡忡。我咨询过生理学和心理学的学者，但无一人能对这些现象做出令人满意的解释。我觉得这种怪异的现象只发生在我身上，可又认为这样的看法有失偏颇，因为我知道我哥哥也曾遇到过类似的麻烦。经过分析，我得出了这样的结论：这些影像的出现，是在极为兴奋的状态下，大脑对视网膜产生的反射作用。鉴于我在其他方面都很正常，心态也很平和，由此可知，这种影像绝对不是由心理疾病和精神痛苦而导致的幻觉。例如，假如我看到了埋死人或者什么刺激性的场面，等到夜深人静时，这些场面就会逼真地浮现在我眼前，任我怎么赶都赶不走。有的时候，我甚至把手伸到空中去抓它们，而它们竟岿然不动。假如我的推论没有错，那么，将人们想象到的任何事物变成影像投射到屏幕上让人观看，是有可能做到的。一旦这种可能成为现实，将会彻底改变人与人之间的关系。我坚信，这一奇迹有朝一日必将变为现实。顺便提一下，我为了解决这一问题已经进行了深入的思考。

为了摆脱这些折磨人的影像，我千方百计地转移注意力，去想自己看到的其他事物，这样倒是可以暂时缓解痛苦，但要达到这一目的，我就得接连不断地想象出新的影像替代旧影像。没过多久，我发现自己所掌握的影像已经用尽，“影像库”已空空如也，因为我对世界了解得太少，眼光仅局限于家里以及邻近区域的事物。当相同的景象第二次或第三次在我脑海中出现，企图把眼前的影像驱逐开时，它们的缓解效力渐渐消失，以至完全无济于事。于是，出于本能，我开始跳出自己所熟知的小天地，于是看到了一些新的影像。这些影像起初模糊不清，朦朦胧胧，一旦我集中注意力观看，它们就倏然不见了。不过，久而久之，它们渐渐趋于清晰，最终竟将真实物体具象地呈现在我眼前。我很快发现，假如不断扩大自己的视野，不断获取新的印象，就能给我的心灵带来极大的安慰，于是我开始远足（当然指的是思维的远足）。一到夜里（有时是在白天）独处一室，我的思想便云游天下，到各个地区、城市和国家游览，在那儿居住，交朋结友。尽管这像是天方夜谭，然而却是真实情况——那些朋友对我和蔼可亲，跟现实生活中的朋友别无两样，他们栩栩如生，宛如生活在真实世界一般。

就这样，我一直过着神游他方的日子，直至17岁，才正儿八经地将注意力转向了发明创造。这时，我惊喜地发现：我可以充分利用自己的这种超凡的想象能力，不需要模型，不需要绘图，也不需要实验，单凭想象就能把所有细节完美地呈现在脑海中。这样，我便不知不觉地形成了一套新的方法，将发明创造的理念和观点变为现实——虽然这与纯粹的实验性理论背道而驰，而我却觉得我的方法要快捷和有效得多。人们设计某种装置，准备用以验证某种不成熟的想法时，发现自己会不可避免地纠缠于这种装置的细节和缺陷。随着装置的完善和重制，他们的注意力便会愈加分散，甚至忽略掉设计的基本原理，这样也许能取得一些效果，但质量却会大打折扣。

我的设计方法却与之不同。我不会急于求成、匆忙动手，一旦有了想法，我会立刻在脑海里构图，在脑海里修改其结构，改良设计，然后在脑海里进行操作。是在头脑中开动涡轮机还是在车间里对它进行试验，对我而言完全无关紧要。甚至我脑海里设计的涡轮机出了毛病，我也能觉察到。不管怎样，我的想象与实际情况毫无二致，没有任何区别，结果都是一样的。以这种方式，我可以迅速地将一种想法付于实践并加以完善，其间不接触任何实物。直到将所能想到的一切的合理改进都完成，再也找不出缺陷时，我才会把在心里最终形成的产物转化为实物。我设计出的装置，运行情况每次都跟我的构想吻合，试验结果完全符合我的计划，20年来无一例外。怎么可能会有其他情况出现呢？工程、电气和机械，所有的试验结果都符合我的设计计划。从可行性理论到实际数据，所有一切都可以预先在脑海中测试。人们通常的做法是将不成熟的想法付于实践，依我看那纯粹是浪费精力、金钱和时间。

虽然早年经受了精神折磨，但除了以上收获，我还另有所得。持续不断的脑力劳动提高了我的观察力，使我发现了一个极为重要的事实——脑海中出现的影像每次都是对以前见过的场景的反映，一遇到特殊的、不同寻常的情况就会出现，而每一次我都会不由自主地追溯其源头。过了一段时间，这几乎成了一种不假思索的行为，使得我具有了一种超凡的能力，能够将因和果联系在一起。不久，我惊讶地发现自己的每一种构想都是受到外界的影响而产生的。非但如此，我的行为举止无不以同样的方式受到影响。随着时间的推移，我非常清楚地意识到自己只不过是一台会移动的机器，一旦感官受到刺激便做出反应，进行思考和采取行动。由此，我提出了自动遥控机械理论——这一理论在操作层面虽然至今尚不完善，但它的潜力最终一定会显现出来。多年来，我一直致力于设计自动控制机，坚信这样的具有一定智能的机器是可以生产出来的，它势必会在商业和工业领域引发一场革命。

大约12岁的时候，通过艰苦的努力，我终于第一次成功地将影像从脑海里驱逐了出去，但是对上文提到的那种闪光却始终无力加以控制。那种闪光也许是我最奇特的体验，是一个解不开的谜。当我发现自己身处险境，或经历大悲大喜时，经常会出现这样的闪光。有几次，我看到周围到处是燃烧的火舌。随着时间的流逝，这种现象非但没有减弱，反而更加强烈，在我25岁时似乎达到了巅峰。1883年，我在巴黎应一位著名的法国制造商邀请出外打猎。由于长期困守在工厂的小天地里，出外呼吸到新鲜空气让我顿感神清气爽。当晚回城的途中，我觉得极其兴奋，像有一团火在大脑里燃烧。我看到了闪光，就好像脑子里有一轮小太阳在放射光芒。那一整夜，我不断地冷敷我那发烫的脑门。最后，闪光出现得越来越少，也越来越弱，但三个星期后才彻底消失。后来再有人请我去打猎，我都会斩钉截铁地拒绝。

每当我突发灵感，产生新的想法时，时不时地就会出现这种闪光现象。不过这种闪光不再令人感到那么焦灼，强度也会有所减弱。合上眼睛的时候，每次我先看到的都是一片幽深、色彩均匀的蓝色背景，那种蓝色不像是白天晴朗的天空，而像是没有星光的夜空。过上一小会儿，这幅场景就会变得活跃起来，出现无数绿色的闪光点，一层一层的，逐渐向我逼近。随后，这幅场景的右边会出现一个美丽的图案，由两组平行、密集排列的线条组成——两组线条构成直角，五彩缤纷，以黄色、绿色和金色为主。紧接着，线条越来越亮，整个图案密密麻麻布满了闪闪发亮的光点。这幅画面会慢慢地从我眼前经过，大约十秒钟之后从左边消失，留下一片沉闷、让人讨厌的灰色，而这片灰色很快变成翻腾的云海，那云团挨挨挤挤，似乎竭力想变成人形。奇怪的是，在后一段景象出现之前，我怎么也没法给这片灰色的背景添加任何形状。每天入睡之前，都会有人或物的影像从我眼前掠过。看见它们，我就知道自己快要进入梦乡了。看不见它们，就意味着我会彻夜难眠。

幻想对我早年人生产生了某种程度的影响，对此我还有一种奇特的经历可以加以说明。跟大多数孩子一样，我喜欢跳跃，后来产生了强烈的愿望，希望自己能飘浮在空中。有时山里刮来一阵富含氧气的强风，我感到自己身轻如燕，于是便纵身一跳，在空中飘浮很长时间——那是一种教人欣喜若狂的感觉。后来发现这仅仅是幻想，我失望到了极点。

在那段时期，我有许多古怪的个人好恶以及习惯，有些可以归因于受到了外界的影响，有些则无法解释。对于女人的耳环，我极其憎恶，可是对于其他饰品，如手镯等，却比较喜欢，喜欢的程度取决于饰品的设计图案。看到珍珠会令我头昏脑涨，可是我又特别喜欢闪闪发亮的水晶以及带有锐角和平面的物体。除非你用枪逼着我，否则我绝不会用手去触摸别人的头发。看到桃子，我就会发高烧。只要家里有一小片樟脑，无论在什么地方，都能让我坐卧不安。甚至到了今天，我依旧对这些东西过敏，见了就心烦。吃饭的时候，如果汤盘里掉进一小片纸，我就感到嘴里有一股怪异的恶心味道。我走路数步子，吃饭则计算汤盘、咖啡杯的容量以及食物的份数，否则这顿饭就吃不好。我重复过的所有动作或做过的事情，其次数都必须能被三整除，如若不然，我就强迫自己再来一遍，哪怕再花上几个小时也心甘情愿。

8岁之前，我性格懦弱、优柔寡断，缺乏勇气和力量，从未有过坚定的信念，情绪不稳定，经常出现波动，从一个极端走向另一个极端。我杂念丛生，愿望就像神话中的九头蛇(3)，砍掉一个头，又会生出两个。我提心吊胆，害怕生活中的苦难，害怕死亡，对宗教具有恐惧感，常常产生迷信的念头，总是怕恶灵缠身，怕妖魔鬼怪以及其他黑暗世界的魍魉。后来，一个翻天覆地的变化突然来到，彻底改变了我的人生轨迹。

我最大的爱好就是读书。家父有一个很大的藏书室，一有机会我就溜进去找书看，以满足自己强烈的读书欲。家父却不允许我看书，一见我看书就生气，后来发现我偷偷地看，便索性把蜡烛藏起来，生怕我把眼睛看坏。没有蜡烛，我就找来牛油放进锡铁盒当灯油，用几根树枝做灯芯，每天夜里把锁眼和门缝一堵便开始读书，常常会读到次日拂晓时分——此时家人都还在睡觉，只有母亲已经起床，开始了她一天的辛勤劳作。一次，我无意中发现了一本翻译成塞尔维亚语的匈牙利著名作家约西卡的小说《阿巴菲》（《阿巴的儿子》）。这本书不知怎的唤醒了我沉睡的意志力，于是我开始有意识地练习自我控制。最初，我的决心就像四月的雪，很快就会动摇。但没过多长时间，我就克服了自己的弱点，终于可以按照自己的意志做事情了，这让我感到了前所未有的快乐。随着时间的推移，这种高强度的脑力训练成了我的第二天性。开始的时候，我必须强行压制自己的意志，但后来愿望和意志便逐渐达到了一致。经过几年的训练，我达到了完全能够自控的程度，甚至可以以游戏的心态控制自己的爱好，而有些嗜好足以摧毁意志最坚强的人。在某一个年龄段我染上了赌瘾，令父母非常犯愁。坐在牌桌旁赌博，对我而言是天大的乐事。家父的一生堪为人之表率，无法容忍我这般浑噩度日，浪费时间和金钱。我固然有强大的自制力，但人生观却不健康，于是对他说：“只要我愿意，随时都可以停止赌博。但是，这种享受只有用天堂的快乐才能够买得到，让我放弃，这值得吗？”他经常冲我发火，对我的行为表示不满。而母亲则不然，她了解男人的脾气，深知要想让我悬崖勒马，得靠我自己大彻大悟。记得有一天下午，我把自己的钱输了个精光，心里还想赌。只见母亲拿着一沓钱走到我面前说：“去痛痛快快赌个够吧。把家里的钱赌光了，你也就甘心了。我知道你一定会浪子回头的。”她说对了——我立刻便控制住了自己的欲望。假如赌博的欲望再强烈百倍，就更能显现出我的自控力，唯此一点令我感到有点儿遗憾。我不仅遏制住了赌博的欲望，还将它连根拔起，一点儿痕迹也没有留下。自那以后，我对任何形式的赌博都不再感兴趣了，就像我不喜欢剔牙一样。

有一段时期，我抽烟抽得很厉害，严重地威胁到了我的健康，后来凭借意志的力量，我不仅戒了烟，还杜绝了抽烟的欲望。很久以前，我曾患有心脏病，后来发现这是由于每天早晨喝咖啡所致的，于是我就不再喝了。我得承认这可不是件容易的事。以这种方式，我还戒除和控制了其他的一些不良习惯和欲望，非但保住了性命，还从中获得了极大的满足感（大多数人认为这是苦修生活，牺牲了人生乐趣）。

完成了格拉茨理工大学(4)的学业之后，我的精神陷入了彻底崩溃的状态。在这段时期，我观察到了许多奇怪得教人无法相信的现象。

第二章　发明创造的最初尝试


那是一段非同寻常的人生经历，容我简单做一个介绍，也许会引起心理学和生理学专家的兴趣。再说，这段令人痛苦的时光对我以后的心路历程以及自己所从事的研究都产生了极为深远的影响。不过，在介绍之前，很有必要回顾一下当时的环境和条件，或许从中可以理出些头绪。

从孩提时起，家里就要求我学会自省。这种要求当时折磨得我不轻，但现在我觉得自己因祸得福，意识到自省无论是对怎样看待人生，还是获得事业的成功都有着不可估量的价值。职业压力和通过知识途径不断涌入我们的意识的来自外界的各种印象，使现代社会在很多方面存在危险。大多数人都是只关注外部世界的是是非非，置自己的内心世界于不顾。数以百万计的人过早地死亡，主要原因就在于此。即便关注内心世界的人当中，也普遍存在着一种错误倾向——能不多想就不多想，对真正的危险视而不见。这种倾向个人有之，一个民族也多多少少有之。你只要看一看禁酒运动就一目了然了。禁酒令即便不违反宪法，也流于草率。它通行全国，严禁人们喝酒，但另一现象却显而易见——人们不喝酒了，却从咖啡、烟草、口香糖以及其他东西中寻找刺激，甚至小孩子也如此，这对国民的身体造成的危害更大，从死亡率便可得知。举例来说，上大学时，我根据维也纳公布的死亡率，发现在喝咖啡的人群中，因患心脏病而死亡的人数，比其他人群有时会高出67％。在茶叶消费量过大的城市可能会有类似的观察结果。这些醇香的饮品会极大地刺激大脑神经，使其逐渐衰竭。它们还会严重地干扰动脉循环，然而由于毒副作用出现得慢，这种情况不为人所察觉，因此饮者会掉以轻心。抽烟可以使你的思维变得轻松愉快，但是却会减弱思维的深度以及强度，而思维的深度以及强度是活跃的原创性智力劳动所必需的。口香糖固然能有一时之用，但很快就会破坏你的腺体系，造成不可修复的损害，就更别提它还会叫人感到恶心了。少量的酒精不失为极好的补品，但酒精过量则会产生毒副作用，至于你喝的是威士忌还是胃液里由糖而转化来的酒精，都无关紧要。不容忽视的是，这些东西都是有效的终结者，是大自然的帮手，协助大自然坚持严格而公正的适者生存的法则。热衷于改革的人也应该注意到人类历来都有任性的一面，所以与其严加管束，还不如遵循“放任主义”。说句实话，根据现在的生活条件，我们的确需要兴奋神经的东西以保持高效率的工作，同时又必须从各方面调整和控制自身的食欲及愿望。多年来我都是这么做的，以此在身体和精神上保持青春的活力。我并不总是喜欢自我节制，但我发现这样做给我带来了丰厚的回报，使我的人生经历轻松愉快。此处不妨讲一两件往事，希望能让一些人相信我的看法和信念。

不久前的一个寒风刺骨的夜晚，由于打不到出租车，我就步行返回下榻的旅馆。路面又湿又滑。后边离我有半个街区远的地方，还有一个人在赶路，他显然跟我一样，也急切想回到住所去。突然，我腾空跳起，就在那一瞬间大脑中闪过一道白光，神经立刻做出反应，肌肉缩紧。我在空中来了个180。的大旋转，落下时双手先着地。然后，我若无其事地继续走路。

后边的那个陌生人赶上来，用审视的眼光打量着我问：“你今年多大了？”

“哦，差不多59岁吧。”我回答说，“怎么啦？”

“是吗？”他说，“我曾经见一只猫做过这样的动作，但从未见过一个人竟能如此灵巧。”

大约一个月前，我想买一副新眼镜，于是就去一位眼科医生那里做例行视力检查。我远远地就可以十分轻松地看清视力表上最小的标识，使得他向我投来疑惑的目光。但我告诉他，我已年过60，这更是惊得他张口结舌。我的朋友们经常评价我穿着得体，衣服非常合身，不宽也不紧。但他们哪里知道，我的衣服都是按35年前的尺码定做的，这一尺码从来就没有变过。在这么长的时间里，我的体重也丝毫未变。

关于这一点，我可以告诉诸位一段有趣的往事。那是1885年冬天的一个晚上，我和爱迪生先生、爱迪生照明公司的董事长爱德华·H.约翰逊以及该公司的经理巴彻勒先生一道走进了第五大道65号（该公司各机构的所在地）对面的一个小处所。有人提议互相猜体重，并让我先站到体重秤上。爱迪生摸了摸我全身说：“特斯拉体重142磅，误差在一盎司以内(1)。”他猜得非常准确。我当时的净体重（不穿衣服）是142磅，现在依然如此。我悄悄地问旁边的约翰逊：“爱迪生怎么可能如此精准地猜出我的体重？”

“这个嘛，”他压低声音说，“我可以把秘密告诉你，但你不许对别人说。他曾经在芝加哥的一家屠宰场干过很长时间，每天要为几千头猪称重。这就是秘诀。”

我尊贵的朋友昌西·米切尔·迪皮尤(2)曾经对一个英国人讲过他早年的一段趣闻。对方听得满脸困惑，一年后才悟出了其中的幽默，乐得开怀大笑。实话实说，我理解约翰逊的笑话花的时间比那个英国人更长。

我现在身体健康，得益于自己谨小慎微、有节制的生活方式。你恐怕想不到，我小的时候曾害过三次大病，病情无望好转，医生们均以为回天乏术呢。除了生病，由于无知和无畏，我还经历过种种艰难及险境，一次次侥幸脱险，才得以劫后余生。有好几次我都差点儿被水淹死。我还差点儿死于被开水烫和被火烧，亦被埋进过土里，迷过路，被冻僵过。我遇见过疯狗、野猪以及其他野兽，每次脱险都是九死一生。经历过那么多可怕的疾病，那么多形形色色、稀奇古怪的危险之后，我仍精神矍铄、饱满，这似乎是个奇迹。但回顾这些往事，我坚信自己能够幸存至今肯定并非偶然。

发明家的所作所为，从根本上来讲，就是挽救生命。无论是控制自然力还是改进器械，抑或为人们提供更舒适和便利的生活，其本质都是在提高人类生活的安全性。而且，在遇到危险时，他们比普通人的自救能力更强，因为他们眼观六路耳听八方，善于随机应变。我在某种程度上就具有这种特质。虽然没有其他直接证据，但我的一些个人经历还是可以证明这一点的。此处我暂举一两例，由读者自己判断好啦。我14岁那年的一天，和几个小伙伴在河里游泳。我想吓吓他们，打算潜到一座长长的水上建筑物之下，从另一端悄悄钻出来。我跟鸭子一样，天生就会游泳和潜水，因而坚信完成这一计划不在话下。于是，我潜入水里，一从小伙伴们的眼前消失，便转过身，迅速地向对面游去。后来我满以为已经安全地游出了那座建筑物的范围，便打算浮出水面，谁知竟意外地撞在了一根椽子上。当然，我又急速朝下潜，拼命划水向前冲，直至气都快透不过来了。这时，我再次上浮，脑袋又撞在了一根椽子上。我都有点儿绝望了，但还是拼尽全力，第三次奋力一搏，结果仍以失败告终。由于缺氧，我感到越来越难以忍受，只觉得头发晕，身子朝下沉。此时此刻，我似乎已完全陷入了无望的绝境。突然，眼前出现了一道闪光，那座建筑物的结构变得十分清晰。不知是亲眼看到还是靠猜度，我发现水面和架在椽子上的木板之间有一点儿空隙，我在几乎失去知觉的情况下浮了上去，把嘴贴近木板，总算吸到了一点点儿氧气。不幸的是，就在这时一个浪头打来，差点儿把我呛死。这时的我宛若身在梦境，一次次进行尝试，直至狂跳不已的心逐渐平静了下来。之后，我又数次下潜寻找生机，结果屡遭失败，完全失去了方向感。不过，就在小伙伴们已经绝望，正在打捞我的尸体时，我总算成功脱险、绝处逢生。

由于鲁莽，那年的游泳季对我而言算是完蛋了，可是我很快就忘记了那次教训，仅仅两年之后便陷入了更为危险的境地。当时我在一座城市里上学，离城不远有一条河，河上有一座拦河大坝和一个大型面粉厂。一般情况下，河水只比堤坝高出两三英寸(3)，在那儿游泳基本不会有什么危险，所以我喜欢在那儿游泳，把它当成了一种体育项目。一天，像往常一样，我又单独到那儿享受游泳的快感。我在游到距离石筑的拦河大坝不远的地方时，惊恐地发现河水已上涨，正在迅速地把我朝下冲去。我试图游开，但为时已晚。不过，幸好我用双手紧紧抓住堤坝，才没有被冲下去。水流巨大的冲击力压在我的胸口，使得我几乎无法把脑袋露出水面。当时看不见一个人在附近，我的呼救声被轰隆轰隆的落水声所淹没。慢慢地，我逐渐耗尽了力气，双手就快抓不住墙壁了。正当我快要撒手，任河水将我冲下堤坝，在坝下的石头上摔个粉身碎骨时，我的眼前突然出现了一道闪光，和一张熟悉的表明水流的压力与受力面积成正比的水压原理示意图。于是，我不由自主地把身体转向左侧，结果水流就好像被施了魔法一样，压力顿时减小。我发现，这种姿势比较容易抗击水流的冲击力。不过，我仍未脱离险境，知道自己早晚都会被冲走，即便有人发现，跑来救我，恐怕也来不及了。我虽然有两只手，但右臂的力量几乎已用尽，只能靠左手了。因而，我不敢把身子转向另一侧休息，已经到了山穷水尽的地步，我只好顺着堤坝慢慢移动。这时，我的脸是朝着面粉厂的，而那儿的水流更急、更深，所以我必须反向移动。那真是一场漫长而痛苦的考验。快到尽头时，我差点儿功亏一篑，因为我面前的堤坝上有一处凹陷。我耗完了最后一丝力气，总算渡过了难关，一到河岸上就昏了过去。后来，人们在那儿发现了我。我身体左侧的皮肤被河水几乎全部撕了下来，过了好几个星期高烧才退，这才彻底康复。这只是诸多例子中的两个，但足以表明：要不是出于发明家的本能，我恐怕活不到今天来讲这个故事了。

很多人对我的发明感兴趣，常常问我是什么时候以及如何开始搞发明的。对此，我只能根据自己的记忆加以回答。记得第一次尝试发明，我的野心是很大的，既想发明一种装置，又想发明一种方法。至于“装置”，已有前人发明在先，而“方法”则是由我首创。事情的经过是这样的：我的一个小伙伴得到了一套钓钩和钓鱼用具，在村子里引起了很大的轰动。第二天一早，所有的小伙伴都跟着他钓青蛙去了，唯独撇下了我，原因是我跟他吵过架。我从未见过钓钩，想象着它一定很神奇，具有奇特的功能，于是对不能参加这次活动十分失望。在一种愿望的驱动下，我找来一截软铁丝，用两块石头将它的一端砸出一个锋利的尖，再弯成钩，绑在一根结实的绳子上。随后，我砍了根竹竿，收集了一些诱饵，便到小溪边青蛙多的地方去了。可是我钓来钓去也没钓到一只青蛙，于是几乎无心再钓了。就在这时，我看见有只青蛙蹲在树桩上，便将空钓钩伸到它面前逗它。起先，它显得萎靡不振，后来渐渐鼓起了眼泡，眼睛里充血，身体也胀得有原来的两倍大，跟着就凶猛地扑上来咬住了钓钩。我立刻把它拉了上来，接着用同样的方法钓了一只又一只，百试不爽。我的小伙伴们虽然装备精良，却一无所获，见我满载而归，羡慕极了。很长一段时间，我对自己的秘诀都三缄其口，独自一人去垂钓，可最终由于过圣诞节心情好，我竟将秘诀公布于众了。这下子，每个小伙伴都学会了这一套，次年夏天给当地的青蛙带来了“灭顶之灾”。

我的第二次尝试是在我最初的本能冲动推动下进行的——正是这种本能冲动日后驱动着我去控制大自然的力量，以造福人类。这次的发明是由“五月臭虫”（美国人称其为“六月臭虫”）引起的——这是一种真正的害虫，灌木丛里黑压压的到处都是，有时数量之多能把树枝都压断。我把四只“五月臭虫”拴在一个十字架上，将十字架放在一根细轴上转动，再把转动的能量传输给一个大圆盘，这样就获得了相当大的“驱动力”。这些虫子十分卖力，一旦开始工作就不知道休息了，转啊转的，一连几个小时都不会停下来，天气越热，它们干得越起劲。一切都很顺利，直到一个不认识的男孩走过来，才出了问题。他是一位奥地利退役军官的儿子。那家伙竟然把我的“五月臭虫”都活活吞吃了，美滋滋的就好像在享用一道味道绝佳的蓝蚝大菜。我见了恶心极了，于是结束了这种前景辉煌的试验，那以后再也没有碰过“五月臭虫”以及其他的虫子。

根据我的回忆，这之后我拿祖父的钟表开刀，进行拆卸和组装。拆卸我干得总是很成功的，组装却屡屡失败。后来，祖父以一种不太文明的方式横加干涉，使我的试验戛然而止。若说再次进行钟表方面的试验，那是30年以后的事了。此事过后不久，我用一根空管、一个活塞和两个插栓组装了一支玩具气枪。射击时，活塞冲向枪体腹部，带有两个抓手的管子受到撞击，猛地向后弹去，而两个插栓之间的空气受到挤压便迅速升温，其中的一个砰的一声巨响射了出去。组装这样的玩具枪，关键在于选择形状合适的空心管。组装这支枪，我大功告成，但因为试验时会威胁到我家的玻璃窗户而遭到抵制，家里人一个劲给我泼凉水。如果没记错，接下来我迷上了用木头刻剑，拿家具上的木板当原料（这种原料唾手可得）。那段时间，我受塞尔维亚爱国诗歌的影响，对英雄们的武艺佩服得五体投地，于是便跑到玉米地里，把玉米秆当作敌人挥剑大砍大杀，一砍就是几个小时，糟蹋庄稼不说，还常常被妈妈打屁股。妈妈打我可不是装装样子，而是真打。

这些事都发生在我6岁之前。后来我在斯米莲村（即我的出生地）读了一年小学。接下来，我们举家迁往附近的戈斯皮奇小城。这次搬家对我而言简直就像是一场灾难。家乡有鸽子、小鸡、绵羊，还有颇为壮观的鹅群——鹅群早出晚归，一到早晨便翱翔蓝天，出外觅食，日落时分从觅食地排着整齐的队列返回，那阵容就是叫现在最优秀的空军看了也会自叹弗如。跟它们告别，我的心都快碎了。在新家，我只不过是个囚犯，整日待在家里透过百叶窗观看外边素不相识的行人。我生性害羞，不愿见人，宁愿面对一头咆哮的狮子，也不愿见那些在街上溜达的城市闲汉。可是，星期天我得穿戴整齐到教堂做礼拜，这让我难受极了，如芒刺在背。在教堂，我遇到了一件事，多年后回想起来还感到心里很不是滋味。那是我在教堂的第二次历险。前不久我被困在了一座古老的教堂里整整一夜，那座教堂位于难以抵达的高山上，每年只开放一次。那是一次可怕的经历，但这次的更糟。小城里有个阔太太，人是个好人，就是有点儿爱慕虚荣，到教堂做礼拜时常常盛装打扮，身穿曳地长裙，仆从们前呼后拥。一个星期天，我到钟楼上敲响了大钟之后，三步并作两步往楼下跑，恰逢这位阔太太经过，结果我不小心踩在了她的曳地长裙上。只听刺啦一声，她的长裙裂开了，声音之大就像是新兵不小心走火闹出的响动。家父气得脸色发青，轻轻地扇了我一巴掌。那是他对我唯一的一次体罚，可是至今我还能感受得到当时的那种滋味。接下来出现的那种令人尴尬和困惑的局面，实在难以用语言表达。我在当地遭到了排斥，后来发生了一件事才让我挽回了面子，令众人对我刮目相看。

小城里有一位年轻有为的商人，他组建了一支消防队，购置了一辆崭新的消防车。这位商人给每位消防队员发了制服并指挥消防队训练，他准备举行一个检阅仪式。所谓消防车其实就是一个水泵，由16名队员操作，漆成黑红两色，十分漂亮。一天下午，消防车被拉到了河边，准备举行正式的检阅仪式。人们倾城而出，赶来看这一盛景。演讲和典礼仪式结束后，一声令下，消防队员开始喷水，可是喷嘴里一滴水也喷不出来。教授和专家们群策群力，却找不出哪里出了毛病。我赶到现场时，人们正急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。我在机械原理方面的知识为零，也不懂得什么空气压力，但却本能地感到是水下的抽水管出了问题，抽水管可能被堵住了。于是我涉水打通了堵塞处，消防车的喷嘴便突然喷出了水，浇到了好几个人的漂亮衣服上。曾几何时，阿基米德(4)在锡拉丘兹街头裸奔，大着嗓门狂呼“我发现啦”，曾引起过轰动，而他引起的轰动恐怕并不比我所引起的大。我被人们扛在肩头游行，一下子成了英雄。

在小城安顿下来后，我进入一所所谓的师范学校，开始了四年的学习，准备考大学（或大学预科班）。在这段时期，我仍孩子气地进行各种尝试和探险，麻烦也如影随形。值得一提的是，我在捕捉乌鸦方面颇有建树，在当地享有“捕乌鸦冠军”之美称。我采用的方法极其简单，只不过是到树林里去，躲在灌木丛中，模仿乌鸦的叫声而已。一般情况下，我会先听到几声回应，过不了多久，就会有一只乌鸦扑棱着翅膀落到我跟前的灌木上。这时，我只需扔出一块纸板转移它的注意力，然后一跃而起，一把抓住它，让它来不及逃离茂密的灌木丛。用这种办法，我想抓多少只就能抓多少只。不过，后来发生了一件事，使得我对乌鸦们敬畏了起来。一次，我抓住了两只很漂亮的乌鸦，跟一位朋友一起回家。谁知一出树林，就见有几千只乌鸦聚在一起，发出震耳欲聋的呱呱叫声。没过几分钟，它们飞过来追我们，将我们团团围住。起初，我还觉得挺好玩，直至后脑勺挨了重重一击，栽倒在了地上。它们对我群起而攻之，吓得我赶快放掉了那两只乌鸦。接着我一头钻进了山洞，与躲在那里的朋友会合，这才松了口气。

学校里的一批机械模型引起了我的兴趣，之后我就开始关注水轮机了。我制作了好多台水轮机模型，并乐此不疲地进行操作。那时的生活简直充满了神奇的色彩，用一个例子可以加以说明。我的叔叔觉得我这种业余爱好派不上用场，不止一次责备过我。我读过一篇关于尼亚加拉大瀑布(5)的报道，不由着了迷，脑海中出现了一个巨大的水轮，幻想着可以用瀑布驱动它。我告诉叔叔，说我将来一定要到美国去实现这一计划。30年后，当我的这一理想在尼亚加拉大瀑布变成现实时，我不由感慨万分，觉得人的大脑真是神秘莫测啊！

除此之外，我还发明制造了很多其他的装置，其中最棒的要算弓弩了。我的弩箭射得很远，远得让你看都看不见，而近距离则可射穿一英寸厚的松木板。我由于不断练习拉弩射箭，所以腹肌发达，肚子上的皮厚得堪比鳄鱼的皮。我常常暗自思忖：通过这样的练习，我就是吞下小石子，也能消化得了！另外，投掷石头也是我的一门绝技，此处不能略过不提，若是拿到竞技场上露一手，一定能叫观众惊叹不已。接下来我要讲一件往事，看看我是怎样凭借这一门独步天下的绝技创下丰功伟绩的，读者听了恐怕会难以置信。一天，我和叔叔在河边散步——那时候，我随时随地都要练习我的绝技——但见夕阳西沉，鲑鱼在河里嬉戏，不时跃出水面，闪着亮光，在远处礁石的映衬下其轮廓一清二楚。当然，在这种条件有利的情况下，不管谁用石头砸鲑鱼恐怕都能砸得中。不过，我要做的事情却难得多，并且把我的意图预先详尽地告诉了叔叔。我说我要用石头砸鲑鱼，砸得它贴在礁石上，让它身首异处。我话音刚落，一扬手便完成了这一壮举。叔叔望着我，惊得几乎连魂都没有了，大呼：“你是魔鬼，快滚开！”他接下来一连几天都没有跟我说话。这样的光辉事迹将会被淹没在历史的长河里，但我觉得它们给我带来了荣耀，足够我心安理得地回味终生。

第三章　再接再厉续新篇——发现旋转磁场


10岁的时候，我进入了文理高中(1)，这是一所新成立的学校，教学设备非常完善。物理系拥有各种各样非常棒的科学实验仪器，电学方面的以及机械学方面的都有。老师经常用这些仪器做示范和实验，看得我心醉神迷，这无疑成为鼓励我发明创造的强大动力。我对数学也情有独钟，常常因为计算速度快而得到教授的表扬。这得益于我拥有在大脑中将数字形象化并计算的能力，并不是用普通的直观方式进行计算，而是将数字视为有生命的活体。再难的演算，无论是在黑板上列算式还是用心算，对我而言都一样容易。不过，徒手绘图倒是叫我很伤脑筋，而这门课的课时偏偏又很多，这使得我简直受不了。说来也奇怪，我们家大多数人在这方面都是高手。也许，我之所以如此反感徒手绘图，只不过是因为我更偏爱不受干扰地思考吧。要不是班上有几个笨得不能再笨，什么都不会的学生垫底，我这门课的成绩肯定就是最差的了。根据当时的教育制度，徒手绘图是必修课，这成了我的一个棘手的难题，过不了这个坎就会影响我的整个生涯。家父耗尽了心力才算帮助我渡过了这一道难关。

在该校求学的第二年，我产生了一种构想，并为此而着了迷，即利用稳定的空气压力催发连续运动。前面所述的修好消防车的事件让我大受鼓舞，充满青春活力的想象也得到了充分的激发，使我意识到真空可以产生无穷无尽的能量。我如痴如醉，一门心思想掌控这取之不尽用之不竭的能量，但在很长一段时间里我只是在黑暗中茫然地摸索。不过，我的努力方向最终趋于明朗，那就是推出一项发明，做一件前人没有做过的事情。我的设想是：取一个圆柱形的装置，装上两个轴承，使圆柱形装置能够在轴承的作用下自由旋转。圆柱形的一部分套着一个精密配合的矩形槽，槽的开口一侧用一个隔板封上，圆柱形装置的内部被隔板分隔成两部分，中间由不漏气的滑动接头将其完全分开。这两部分中的一部分完全封闭，只要把它里面的空气彻底抽空，另外一部分就会自动敞开，这样，圆柱形的装置就能不停地旋转。至少，我是这样设想的。我做了个木制模型，极其精心地将各部件组装在一起，从一侧用气泵抽气。看到圆柱形的装置开始旋转时，我高兴得简直都快发疯了。能够借助机械在天上飞行，是我另一个想实现的梦想——虽然我曾经手持一把撑开的雨伞从房顶跳下，结果摔得很惨，这成了我的一段令人沮丧的回忆。以前，我每天都希望自己能够腾云驾雾，穿越云层飞行到远方，只是不知如何才能梦想成真。现在，我有了具体的计划——制造一架飞行器，在上面只安装一个转轴和一双上下扇动的翅膀，让它靠永不枯竭的真空能量驱动。一旦大功告成，我就可以乘坐着舒适、豪华的飞行器每天翱翔于蓝天——乘坐这样的飞行器，恐怕只有所罗门国王才够格。数年之后我才明白过来：大气压力是垂直作用于圆柱体表面的，而我所看到的圆柱形装置微微旋转的现象是因为漏气造成的。尽管这一点是我逐渐悟出来的，但它对我的打击还是挺沉重的。我差点儿没能完成文理高中的学业，因为我大病了一场，或者说大病了十几场，情况非常危急，弄得医生束手无策。在这段时间里，我仍然坚持读书，从当地的公共图书馆借书。这家图书馆平时很少有人去，还请我帮忙对图书进行分类并帮着编辑图书目录。一天，图书馆交给我几卷新出版的文学作品叫我编进目录。这几本书跟我以前看过的书迥然不同，十分引人入胜，使我完全忘掉了自己那令人绝望的健康状况。它们是马克·吐温(2)的早期作品。也许是因为看了这几本书，我竟然奇迹般地恢复了健康。25年之后，我结识了克莱门先生，和他建立了友谊。我把这段往事讲给他听，惊奇地看到这个伟大的人物竟哈哈大笑，把眼泪都笑出来了。

后来，我又到了克罗地亚的卡尔洛瓦茨(3)（我的一个姑姑住在那里），在那儿的一所更高一层次的文理高中继续学习。那个姑姑是当地的头面人物，丈夫久经沙场，是个参加过无数次战斗的陆军上校。我在他们家住了三年，那段时光令我终生难忘。他们家的家规甚至比战争时期的军规还要严。我就好像一只被精心饲养的金丝雀，吃的饭菜顿顿都质量高、味道鲜美，但少之又少，只有我正常食量的1/10。姑姑把火腿切成像纸一样的薄片，如果上校往我的盘子上添加食物，她会一把夺走，同时会情绪激动地对少校说：“还是小心点儿好，尼科(4)的饭量很小！”其实我饭量极大，就这样我承受着坦塔罗斯(5)一样的痛苦。

不过，姑姑家洋溢着典雅的气氛，具有浓浓的艺术品位，这在那个时期以及那种历史条件下是极为罕见的。那个地区地势低洼，沼泽密布，我虽然服用了大量的奎宁，但还是摆脱不了疟疾和高烧的纠缠。有时河水上涨，会有成群结队的老鼠涌进民宅，见什么吃什么，甚至连晾晒的干辣椒串也不放过。消灭这些害虫成了我的一种很好的消遣。我使用各种办法大大地减少了它们的数量，在当地赢得了一个不值得羡慕的“灭鼠王”的称号。最后，我终于完成了文理高中的学业，结束了饿肚子的苦难生活，拿到了毕业证，也走到了人生的十字路口。

在那些年里，父母的决心一直没有动摇，一心一意想让我将来当牧师。一想到这一点，我心里就发怵。在学校物理学教授强烈的影响下，我已经对电产生了浓厚的兴趣。那位教授极具创造力，经常发明仪器，用来阐释物理学原理。记得他发明了一个仪器，那是一个可以自由旋转的球状物，外面用锡纸包裹，跟静电起电机连接在一起时会飞速旋转。目睹他展示的这种神奇的景象时，我心潮澎湃，激动万分，那种心情实在无法形容。每一个场景都会在我心里激起千层浪花。对于那种神奇的静电力量，我渴望了解更多，渴望从事这方面的实验和研究，但同时又不得不以痛苦的内心顺从命运的安排。

正当我准备长途跋涉返回家乡时，家父却叫人传来了话，他叫我去参加狩猎。这一要求十分奇怪，因为他历来都是强烈反对这项活动的。但过了几天，我得知了真相——霍乱正在我们家乡肆虐逞凶。我没理会父母的愿望，还是找了个机会返回了戈斯皮奇。这种灾难每隔15年至20年就会蹂躏我们的家乡一次，人们对其起因却一无所知，无知的程度简直匪夷所思。他们以为这种致命的疾病是靠空气传播的，于是就用刺鼻的气味和烟雾消灭空气里的病菌。与此同时，他们却饮用受到污染的水，大批大批地死去。我返回家乡的当天就染上了这种可怕的疾病，后来虽然大难不死，可还是在床上躺了九个月，几乎动弹不得。此时的我体力已完全耗尽，第二次来到了死亡的门口。我的病一次次发作，其中有一次使我生命垂危。父亲冲进了病房（他那苍白的面孔至今仍浮现在我眼前），用他自己都不相信的话语安慰我，叫我振作起来。我说：“如果你同意我学习工程技术，我也许可以恢复健康。”他郑重地向我许诺：“我要让你上天下最好的工学院。”我知道他会说话算话的。于是，我心里的一块大石头总算落了地。不过，要不是喝了用一种很奇异的豆子熬出来的苦汤，产生了起死回生的疗效，家父的许诺也是顶不了用的。结果，就像拉撒路(6)一样，我从死神那儿被拉了回来，让所有的人都惊讶万分。父亲坚持让我到山区过上一年，加强户外锻炼，以此增强体质，我勉强同意了。这一年，我大部分时间都带着猎人的装备和一捆书在群山里转悠，由于跟大自然亲密接触，我不仅增强了体质，心智也大增。我不断地思考和计划，产生了许多构想，但这些构想几乎无一例外都是虚无缥缈的。我的构想倒是很清晰，只苦于对原理的了解十分有限。在其中的一项发明项目里，我提出在海底铺设一根跨海管道，通过一座水泵站将水压压进管道，将信件和包裹放在一个十分结实，足以抵御水压的球形容器里，通过管道利用水流推动进行传送。我对为管道提供水压的水泵站进行了精确的计算和设计，其他的细节也精心规划。后来只是由于一个小小的细节被稍加忽略，这个发明项目便无果而终了。我假定海底的水流为任意速度，并且无限提高这个速度，希望以准确的计算为基础产生最佳效果。然而，经过进一步思索，我还是解决不了管道如何承受强大水流的问题，于是决定将这一发明交给公众，由公众完成。

我还有一个发明项目，建造一个可以无拘无束地悬浮在空中，绕赤道运行的环形悬浮器，它能高速飞行，靠某种反作用力制动。搭乘这样的悬浮器，时速可达1000英里(7)左右，这是火车无法比拟的。对此，读者也许会付之一笑。这个项目难以实现，这我得承认，但还不至于像纽约的那位名教授所提的方案那么荒唐。此人想把热带的空气抽到温带去，全然忘了上帝已经提供了一台巨大无比的机器来实现空气流通。

除此之外，我另有一种构想，一种极为重要也极为有趣的构想，那就是利用地球自转获取能量。我发现：由于地球自转带来昼夜更替，地球表面物体的运动方向与水平方向时而相同，时而相反。人类能够用可以想象的极其简单的方式将这一巨变所产生的能量加以利用，为任何一个有人居住的地区提供动力。后来我才意识到自己跟阿基米德一样陷入了窘境（阿基米德竟然幻想在宇宙找一个支点将地球撬起），当时失望的心情是无法用语言表达的。

假期结束后，我被送到了奥地利施蒂里亚州格拉茨市的理工学院学习——那是一所历史悠久、声名卓著的大学，是父亲专门为我挑选的。我翘首以待的时刻终于到来了，而且我衣食无忧，于是立刻投入到了学习中，一心一意要取得成就。由于父亲的潜心教育以及各种各样的机会，我的基础胜他人一筹。我掌握了几门语言，曾在好几个图书馆里博览群书，从中获取的知识多多少少都是有用的。还有，我可以选择自己喜欢的科目，这可是破天荒第一遭。我再也不用为徒手绘图而焦虑了！我下定决心一定要给父母一个惊喜，头一学年便开始发奋，每天凌晨3点起床，一直学到夜里11点，星期天和节假日也不例外。鉴于大多数同学都不用功，自然而然，我在各个科目上都拔得了头筹。那一学年，我通过了九门考试，教授们都认为给我最高分也不为过。放假后，我拿着写满教授赞语的成绩单回到家，准备稍微休整一下。我满以为这是凯旋，谁知家父对我辛辛苦苦挣来的荣誉竟毫不关心，使我一下子泄了气。这几乎扼杀了我的雄心壮志。他去世之后，我发现了一捆教授们写给他的信，不由心如刀绞——那些信说，如果不让我辍学，我一定会由于过分用功而丧命。从那以后，我把主要精力都用在了物理学、力学和数学上，课余时间则泡在图书馆。我不管做什么事情，总强迫自己坚持到底，常常因此而陷入困境。一次，我着手攻读伏尔泰的著作，诧异地发现那个“怪才”靠一天喝72杯黑咖啡竟然写了近100卷的东西，每一卷的字都密密麻麻。再多也要看完！当看完他的最后一卷书，将其放到一旁时，我感到十分高兴，说道：“我再也不读了！”

我在第一学年的出色表现赢得了好几位教授的赞赏和友谊。他们当中有教代数学和几何学的罗格纳教授，负责物理学理论和实验教学的波伊施尔教授，以及教积分学并对微分方程有深入研究的阿里博士。在所有给我上过课的教授里，阿里博士讲课最为精彩。他特别关心我的进步，常常上完课后仍留(8)教室里为我答疑解惑，一待就是一两个小时——他的讲解令我感到心情愉悦。我曾经向他介绍了自己构想的飞行器，这个构想是以合理的科学原理为基础的，并非不切实际的想象。如今，由于我发明了涡轮机，这个构想已经变成了现实，不久将会面世。罗格纳和波伊施尔两位教授都是很独特的人。罗格纳的表达方式很有特色，无论什么时候，一讲到高潮时就戛然而止，随之而至的就是漫长、令人尴尬的停顿。波伊施尔教授是一位条理清晰、极为务实的德国人。他手脚粗大，宛若熊掌，但做实验历来都是娴熟而精确的，从未有过丝毫的误差。

在第二个学年，一台从巴黎运来的格拉姆发电机(9)被送到了我们学院。这台机器装有马蹄形的叠片磁铁和一个用金属丝缠绕的电枢，而电枢上装有整流器。各个部件接通之后，它就能展示电流的不同效果。波伊施尔教授在演示时，把它当作电动机操作，结果电刷出了毛病，冒出了大量火花。我提出，不要那些附件，机器照样可以运转。他认为那是绝对行不通的，同时叫我阐述了一下我的观点。我讲完后，他说：“特斯拉先生也许能成就伟大的事业，但在这件事上的看法注定行不通——这等于是要改变万有引力那样的稳定的引力，使之成为旋转的力。这是永动机的概念，永远不可能实现。”但是，人的本能是可以超越知识的。毫无疑问，我们大脑中埋藏着一些神奇的神经纤维，当我们的逻辑推理或其他思维方式无能为力时，它们能帮助我们发现真理。在教授的权威论断下，我曾一度发生了动摇，但很快就坚信自己是对的，而且以年轻人的那种狂热和无穷的信心投入到了这项研究之中。

第一步，我先在大脑里构想出一台直流发电机，想象它运转起来的样子，并观察电枢中电流的变化。第二步，我再构想出一台交流发电机，然后按照相同的方式研究它的运作情况。第三步，我构想出几个由电动机和发电机组成的机组，用各种方式操作。我脑海中出现的那些影像非常逼真、非常清晰。在格拉茨的剩余时间里，我一直在进行这项研究，十分紧张，但无果而终。最后，我几乎断定这是一个无法解决的难题。1880年，我去了波希米亚的布拉格，希望能完成父亲的心愿，在那里完成大学学业。在那座城市里，我采取了具有决定性的一个步骤，把发电机的整流器卸下来，从一个新的角度细心观察发电机的运行情况，结果还是一无所获。在接下来的一年中，我对生活的认识突然发生了转变，意识到父母为我做出的牺牲太大了，于是我决定减轻他们的负担。当时，美国的电话热刚刚波及欧洲大陆，匈牙利的布达佩斯打算设立电话局。这似乎是一个理想的机遇，而我家的一个朋友恰恰是电话公司的负责人。进了电话局后，我的神经却达到了完全崩溃的状态（这一点上文提起过）。患病期间的那段经历你可能无法相信。我的视觉和听觉一直都好得出奇。若论视觉，远处别人压根看不见的东西，我却看得一清二楚。谈到听觉，小的时候我好几次隐约听见邻居家有噼噼啪啪大火燃烧的声音（那声音没有将邻居从睡梦中惊醒），便大呼救火，使得邻居家没有被大火吞没。

1899年，我已过不惑之年，正在科罗拉多进行试验。当时，我可以清楚地听见550英里开外的雷声，而我的年轻助手们听觉范围最远不超过150英里。所以说，我的耳朵的灵敏度是普通人的13倍(10)还要多。然而，说起来，这样的听力跟我神经高度紧张时的听力相比，简直就跟聋子一样。在布达佩斯的那段时间，隔着三个房间，我都可以听到钟表的嘀嗒声；屋里如果有苍蝇落在桌子上，我的耳朵会听见砰的一声沉闷的巨响；几英里外有马车驶过，会震得我浑身发抖；二三十英里以外的火车鸣笛，会让我觉得自己坐的板凳或椅子在剧烈摇晃，产生无法忍受的痛苦感。而且，我脚下的地面也在不停地颤抖，为了能睡得着觉，我只好在床下铺了橡胶垫子。远处或近处传来的喧闹声，让我觉得就跟有人冲我喊话一样，如果我不能将那些声音一一分辨清楚，一定会被吓着的。阳光时隐时现，会对我的大脑造成冲击，使我感到头晕目眩。从桥下或其他建筑物下走过，我会感到有千钧之力压在我的头上，这时我就调动起全部的意志力加以抵御。在黑暗中，我的感觉和蝙蝠一样敏锐，能感知到12英尺(11)之外的物体——如果那儿有东西，我的脑门上会产生一种奇异的感觉。我的脉搏极不均匀，有时每分钟只有几下，有时每分钟达260下，身体的各个部位都会随之颤抖、抽搐和哆嗦，而这也许是最叫人难以忍受的。一位名医让我每天服用大量溴化钾，说我得的是一种怪病，是不治之症。无限遗憾的是，当时没有生理学家和心理学家对我的病情进行观察研究。虽然我压根就没有指望能够恢复健康，但我孤注一掷，不愿放弃生命。有谁能相信，就是这样一个身处绝境的病人竟能起死回生，成为一个精力充沛、坚韧不拔，又工作了38年，中间无一天间歇，仍然身体强壮、思维活跃的人？这就是我的经历。我强烈渴望活下去，渴望继续我的事业，再加上一位运动员挚友的倾力帮助，奇迹出现了——我不仅恢复了健康，思维也变得更加活跃了。后来再次回想这段经历，我还真有点儿遗憾呢，觉得那次战斗结束得太早了——我还有许多能量没有用上呢。在和疾病做斗争的时候，我跟普通人的想法不同。对我而言，那是一个神圣的誓言，是一个关系生死存亡的大问题。我情知自己如果失败，就会命丧黄泉。我觉得我是胜出者。其实，在我的内心深处早已有了答案，只是当时未能用语言表达出来而已。一天下午，我和朋友在城市公园一边散步一边背诵诗歌——当时的情景至今仍历历在目。那个年龄的我看书过目不忘，能倒背如流。夕阳西沉，使我想起了歌德的《浮士德》里的一段壮丽的诗句。

太阳西坠，结束了一天的劳累，

急匆匆奔向远方，到新天地去绽放生命的花蕾；

呜呼，只恨我没有翅膀摆脱大地的束缚，

去追踪，去寻觅太阳的光辉！

太阳隐去了身影，却留下了一个梦，光辉不退！

哦！我的身体没有翅膀，

何不给思想插上翅膀，让思想腾飞！

当我背诵这段发人深省的诗句时，好像有一道闪电从我的脑海中划过，让我刹那间想到了问题的解决方法。我马上找了一根树枝在沙地上画起示意图来，六年后我在给美国电机工程学会做报告时把它们展示给了听众。当时陪我散步的那个朋友完全能够看懂我的示意图。我脑海中的影像出奇地清晰和具体，就跟现实生活中的金属和石块一样，于是我便对朋友说：“瞧，这是电动机！看好，我要让它动起来！”我当时的那种激动心情，现在是无法形容的。即便皮格马利翁(12)看见自己的雕塑变成了活人，也不及我当时的感受强烈。就算我偶然发现了一千个大自然的秘密，对我而言也不及这一发现价值大——它是我经历了千难万险，眼看就要进入鬼门关时得来的。

第四章　发明特斯拉线圈和变压器


有一段时间，我在大脑中构想机器的图形，发明各种新机器，陶醉其中，享受着极大的快乐。那是一种心灵的愉悦，我之前也有过体验。我思如泉涌，唯一的困难在于怎样抓住那稍纵即逝的念头。我所构想的种种机器都是实实在在、真真切切的，我对每一个细节都了如指掌，哪怕最细微的标识和磨损痕迹也逃不过我的眼睛。在想象中，我乐于让电动机一刻不停地运转——那样的画面更让人赏心悦目。当天生的兴趣爱好逐渐发展成为一种强烈的欲望时，一个人就会大踏步向自己的目标迈进，犹如穿上了七里格靴子(1)。实际上，在不到两个月的时间里，我就发明了许多种类的电动机，并对之进行改进（如今，这些机器均以我的名字命名）。后来，由于生活的需要，我暂时终止了这种耗费心力的脑力劳动——也许，这是幸运之举。我因为一份不太成熟的电话业研究报告来到了布达佩斯。受到命运的捉弄，他们叫我在匈牙利政府管辖的电报总局当绘图员，无奈之下我也只好接受了这份工作。至于工资嘛，此处不便透露，还是不说的好！幸运的是，我很快就赢得了总监的赏识，另有委任，他让我负责设备安装方面的计算、设计和评估。电话局开始运营后，我仍从事这三方面的工作。这份工作使我积累了宝贵的知识和实践经验，同时我的发明创造才能也得到了充分施展。我对电话总局的装置做了许多改良，还完善了电话中继器（或称信号放大器）——这项技术没有申请专利，也没有公开发布，然而，甚至到了今天这项技术的发明也应该归功于我。布达佩斯电话业的创始人普斯卡斯先生对我高效率的工作非常认可，他结束了这座城市的业务之后，便邀请我到巴黎工作。我高兴地接受了他的邀请。巴黎是座充满奇幻魔力的城市，给我留下的印象极深，令我终生难忘。一连几天我都在城里转悠，流连于巴黎的街头。这儿有看不尽的新奇景象，让人陶醉。各种景观随处可见，都具有难以抵御的魅力，弄得我花钱如流水，工资一到手便花个精光。一次，普斯卡斯先生问我在这个新环境中感觉如何，我准确地描述道：“每个月的后29天是最难熬的！”我的生活紧张有序，按现在的话说，过的是“罗斯福(2)式的生活”。每天清晨，不管刮风还是下雨，我都会从我居住的圣马塞尔林荫大道步行去塞纳河畔的游泳馆，在游泳池里游上27个来回，随后再步行一个小时到伊夫里，那儿是公司工厂的所在地。7点半，我会在厂里吃一顿工作早餐，接下来就满怀希望等着吃中午的那顿饭了。在这期间，我会为工厂的经理査尔斯·巴彻勒先生（此人是爱迪生的好友和助手）解决一些难题。在这里，我结交了几个美国人。因为我台球打得好，他们都非常喜欢我。我向他们推介了自己的发明，机工车间的负责人坎宁安先生提出应该成立一家股份公司。我觉得他的提议荒唐可笑，实在不理解这种想法，以为这就是美国人的做事方式，于是便没有采取任何措施。在后边的几个月里，我老是出差，辗转于法国和德国，为发电厂排除故障。回到巴黎后，我向公司的一位高管罗尔先生提交了一份改进发电机的计划书，得到了他的首肯。结果，我大功告成，让董事们喜出望外，于是他们授权给我，让我研发自动稳压器，而这正是我梦寐以求的。此后不久，阿尔萨斯地区的斯特拉斯堡新火车站的照明装置出了问题。在火车站剪彩仪式上，由于电线短路，照明装置发生了爆炸，把一大段墙都炸塌了，而当时德国的老皇帝威廉一世就在现场。结果，德国政府拒绝使用这一套照明装置，这样一来，我们的法国公司将遭受巨大的损失。考虑到我会说德语，而且经验丰富，公司就派我去解决这一难题，希望能将此事搞定。我临危受命，于1883年初去了斯特拉斯堡。

在斯特拉斯堡市发生的一些事，给我留下了难以磨灭的印象。真是无巧不成书，我在那里遇见了一些杰出人才，而他们日后都成了风云人物。后来，我曾对人说：“那座古老的城市有一种叫作伟大的‘细菌’，别人都‘感染’了，而我却是个例外！”我没日没夜地工作，又是排除设备故障和与各方沟通，又是跟政府官员协商。但只要能挤出一点儿时间，我就会跑到火车站对面的机械车间里，用我从巴黎带来的材料组装简易电动机。不过，有关简易电动机的试验一直耽搁到那年夏天才完成。当我看到这台电动机在没有滑动触点和整流器的情况下，受到不同相位的交流电驱动，仍然可以运转时，心里快慰极了——这跟我一年前构想的一样。我当时喜悦盈怀，但那种心情与后来第一次向世人展示这一成果时的欣喜若狂相比，却又有着天壤之别。

我新结交的朋友中，有一位是斯特拉斯堡的前任市长博赞先生。我向他介绍了我的新设备和其他一些发明，想赢得他的支持。他侠肝义胆，对我很仗义，向好几位阔佬推荐我的规划，令人失望的是，那几位阔佬竟无一人感兴趣。他绞尽脑汁，一心想帮助我。我一直牢记博赞先生对我的知遇之恩。1919年7月1日前夕，我突然想起了他给过我的一种“帮助”——那帮助不是金钱方面的，却仍让我心怀感激。1870年德国人入侵斯特拉斯堡时，他曾把一批1801年酿造的圣埃斯塔菲(3)酒埋在地下藏了起来。他声称，没有人比我更有资格喝这种名贵佳酿了。可以说，跟前边所提到的事情相比，这是最让我难以忘怀的一件事。这位知心的朋友劝我尽可能早日返回巴黎，在那儿寻求资助。我倒是巴不得赶快回巴黎，但我的工作和谈判遇阻，小麻烦不断，久久不能结束，当时的情况很不乐观。

在这里，我想叙述一段有趣的经历，以此说明德国人是怎样一丝不苟和讲求“效率”的。当时，有一条走廊需要安装一盏16烛光功率(4)的白炽灯，我选定了位置，让电工铺设电线。干了一会儿，电工突然提出必须咨询一下工程师，于是我们便征求了工程师的意见。工程师先是这不是那不是地说了些反对的话，但最终同意把灯安在距离我选定的位置两英寸远的地方。接下来，工作继续进行。过了一会儿，那位工程师突然有点儿忧心忡忡，对我说应该请示一下质检员艾沃戴克才行。那位大人物被请来了，他又是测量，又是跟工程师争论，最后决定把灯的位置朝后移2英寸，而这个位置正是我原先选定的。可是，不一会儿，又轮到艾沃戴克感到不安了，说此事他曾向质检督察黑尔罗尼莫汇报过，让我等黑尔罗尼莫的决策。由于琐事缠身，那位质检督察几天后才抽出了空。但他最终还是来了，经过两个小时的讨论，决定把灯的位置再朝外移2英寸。我希望他可以就此一锤子定音，但这一希望还是破灭了。他走后又返了回来，对我说：“冯克委员是很挑剔的。对于这盏灯的位置，没有他的明确批示，我不敢轻易决定。”于是乎，我们作了些安排，一大早就洒扫庭院，擦擦洗洗，整理仪容，准备迎接那位大人物的光临。我还特意戴上了手套。冯克来的时候前呼后拥，受到了隆重的接待。经过两个小时的深思熟虑，他突然大声说：“我必须走了。”然后指了指天花板上的一个位置，命令我把灯就装在那儿——那儿正是我最初选的位置！

事情就这样一波三折，一天一变，但我决心已定，不管付出什么样的代价都要达到目的。功夫不负有心人，我的努力得到了回报！1884年春，所有的分歧都消除了，对方最后终于接受了我方的照明装置。我怀着美好的憧憬回到了巴黎。公司的一位高管曾经对我许诺，如果我促成此事，就发给我一大笔奖金，另外还给我一笔数量可观的钱奖励我对发电机做出的改进。我满怀希望，想着能到手许多钱。公司总共有三位高管，为了方便，我就分别用A、B、C指代。当我去找A要钱时，他告诉我决定权在B那里，而B又认为只有C可以敲定，C则非常肯定地说只有A才有权决定是否给我钱。经过几轮的拉锯战和扯皮，我才意识到所谓的奖金其实不过是一张空头支票。

为研究项目筹集资金的努力也遭到了彻底失败，令我的一颗心沉到了谷底。巴彻勒先生劝我到美国去发展，为爱迪生设计新机型。于是，我决定到那个遍地黄金的地方去碰碰运气。可谁知这次机会也差点儿跟我失之交臂。我变卖了自己那少得可怜的物品，预订了火车票，赶到火车站时却发现车已经开动了。就在这时，我发现口袋里的钱和车票都不见了踪影。怎么办？赫拉克勒斯(5)在决定何去何从时，倒是有充裕的时间从容考虑，而我却不然——我一边追着火车跑，一边必须即刻做出决定。我心里千头万绪，乱成了一锅粥，似冷凝器一般剧烈震荡不已。就在这紧急关头，我灵机一动，决定乘船走——根据以往的经验，乘船虽然不舒服，但很便宜。于是，我带着自己所剩无几的东西登上了前往纽约的航船，那些东西中包括我写的几首诗和几篇文章，还有一捆写满计算题的纸张（那些计算题有的是对不可解积分的答案，有的涉及的则是我发明的飞行器）。途中，大部分时间我都坐在船尾，随时准备救落水之人，对于自身的安危完全置之度外。后来，我懂得了一些美国人务实的世界观，回忆起这段经历不由感到后怕，实在不明白自己当时怎么那么傻。

在此，我想讲一讲我对美国的第一印象。我看过几篇阿拉伯神话故事，它们讲述的是神仙施展神通，将普通人送到了充满梦想的国度，让他们经历了令人兴奋的事件的故事。我的情况恰恰相反——神仙把我从一个充满梦想的世界送到了一个极为现实的世界。我所离开的那个国家风光旖旎，充满了艺术气氛，处处令人心醉，而我在美国看到的却是一个机器驱动的社会，粗野和缺乏吸引力。我看见一个大块头警察在街上巡逻，手持警棍（那警棍在我看来简直就是一根大棒），于是便走上前彬彬有礼地问路。“往前走六个街区，然后向左拐弯。”他回答说，眼睛里却闪出恶狠狠的光。我感到又难过又惊讶，不由暗想：“美国就是这个样子？在文明程度上简直比欧洲落后了一个世纪！”1889年我离开美国时，我则坚信美国比欧洲先进100年，直到现在回来后五年过去了，我还坚持这种看法。

在我的一生中，跟爱迪生结识是一件值得纪念的事情。这个杰出的人才早年没有受过良好的教育，在科学研究方面也没有受过训练，却取得了那么辉煌的成就，实在令我刮目相看。我学习过十几种语言，钻研过文学和艺术，大好年华是在图书馆度过的，在那儿如饥似渴地博览群书，从牛顿的定律到保罗·德·科克的小说无所不看，觉得自己大部分的时间都被浪费掉了。但没过多久我就意识到那样的知识积累是我所干过的最棒的事情。没出几个星期，我就赢得了爱迪生的信任。情况是这样的：

当时最快的蒸汽机客轮“俄勒冈号”由于两台照明发电机都出现了故障，不得不停航。那艘轮船的上层建筑是发电机系统安装好之后才建造的，所以发电机是不能从船上卸下来的。情况很危急，爱迪生十分苦恼。当天傍晚我携带工具登上了那艘轮船，苦干了一夜。发电机损毁严重，多处短路和漏电，但在船员的配合下，我终于成功地排除了所有故障。次日凌晨5点，我穿过第五大道返回工厂，路上碰见了爱迪生，他和巴彻勒等人刚从工厂出来，正准备回住处睡觉。“瞧，咱们的巴黎人在夜里逛大街！”他说道。我告诉他我刚刚从“俄勒冈号”下来，已经把两台机器都修好了，他听后默默地看了看我，然后一声不吭地走开了。可他走了一段距离之后，我听见他说：“巴彻勒，这家伙真棒！”自此，我在工作方面便有了充分的自主权，每天从上午10点半一直干到次日凌晨5点，没有一天的休息，差不多有一年之久。爱迪生对我说：“我有过许多勤奋工作的助手，但你是最好的。”在这段时间里，我利用短磁芯和同样的方案设计了24台不同规格的标准机型，用以取代原来的机型。爱迪生曾许诺，等我完成了这个项目之后就给我五万元的奖金，谁知他的话竟成了玩笑。这对我打击很大，于是便辞职不干了。

我辞职后，立刻就有人找上门来，提议以我的名义组建一家弧光灯照明公司。我觉得终于有机会研发电动机了，于是欣然同意了。可是，当我提出这个方案时，我的新同事说：“这是不行的。我们需要的是弧光灯，对你的交流电设备不感兴趣。”1886年，我研制的弧光灯系统获得了成功，被应用到工厂和市政照明上。这下子我成了自由之身，然而却一无所获，只有一张印刷精美但不能当饭吃的股权证书。接下来的一段时间，我在自己不太熟悉的领域里苦苦奋斗，但我最后还是获得了回报——1887年4月，特斯拉电气公司终于成立了。我有了自己的实验室和设备，并且研制出了电动机——那些电动机跟我以前构想的一模一样。对于以前的设计方案，我没有做丝毫的改动，而只是将脑海里出现过的设计图变为现实，机器运行情况完全符合我的预想。

1888年年初，我跟威斯汀豪斯公司(6)签约，准备大量生产这种电动机。不过，有一些重大难题亟待解决。我设计的机器用的是低频电流，而威斯汀豪斯公司的专家采用的是133周的电流，为的是在变电方面取得优势。他们不愿意放弃自己的标准设备，所以，我必须设法改变我的电动机，以符合他们的标准。除此之外，我还要另外设计一台电动机，利用两根电线在这种低频电流下有效地工作。这可不是一件容易的事。

不过，到了1889年年底，我完成了任务，也就没必要继续留在匹兹堡了。回到纽约后，我在格兰街的一个实验室里继续搞我的试验，并立即着手设计高频机。这是一个尚无人涉足的领域，我遇到的问题千奇百怪，这让我步履维艰。我对感应型电动机不予以考虑，怕的是这种电动机产生的正弦波不稳定，而正弦波对于共振却是至关紧要的。如果不是出于这一考虑，我的工作量会大大降低。高频交流电动机还有另外一个缺点，就是速度不稳定，这可能会对它的实际应用带来极大限制。向美国电机工程学会进行演示时，我注意到该机型有好几次都频率调谐失衡，需要进一步改进——这些都是没有预料到的问题。直到很久之后，我才找到了一种方法，使这种高频交流电动机在恒定速度和极限负载条件下工作时，每旋转一周的速度变化控制在极小范围内。

我又对许多其他的因素进行了综合考虑，认为很有必要发明一种比较简单的可以产生电振荡的仪器。早在1856年，凯尔文男爵(7)就提出了电容器放电的理论，只可惜这一重要理论未用于实践之中。我看出了这一理论的可行性，于是便根据他的理论着手研制感应器。我的研发进展神速，在1891年的一次报告会上我向听众展示了一个能够产生五英寸长的电火花的线圈。会上，我坦率地告诉在场的工程师们，说用这种新方法变换电流也是有缺陷的，即电火花的间隙会出现损耗的现象。后来的研究表明：不管是用空气、氢、水银蒸汽、油液或者电子束作为媒介，这种缺陷都始终存在。这是自然规律，就像机械能量转化也存在类似的规律一样。物体从高处落下，我们可以让它垂直降落，也可以让它沿着曲线降落，这些都不算什么问题。幸运的是，这一缺陷并非致命性的，通过调整共振电路的适当比例，其效率可以达到85％。这一发明公布后，得到了广泛的应用，给许多领域带来了革命性的发展。然而，它的潜力还远远没有发掘出来。1900年，我成功地制造了100英尺的强大放电电弧，并围绕球体产生了人工闪电。这时，我想起了最初在格兰街实验室看到的那个小小的电火花，不由感慨万千，激动程度不亚于我发现旋转磁场时的那种感觉。

第五章　发明放大发射机


回首以往的人生经历，我意识到影响我们命运的因素是多么微妙啊！我少年时期遇到的一件事可以说明这一点。一个冬日，我和小伙伴们去爬一座陡峭的高山。积雪虽然很深，但南方吹来一阵阵暖和的风，非常利于爬山。我们玩滚雪球游戏来取乐，雪球被扔出去之后会往下滚动一段距离，而且会多少沾上一点儿雪。在这激动人心的游戏中，我们相互比赛。突然，有一个雪球超出了比赛场的范围向山下滚去，后来变成了房子那么大的巨无霸，轰隆一声巨响滚下了山谷，力量之大震得大地都在微微发颤。我惊呆了，看着眼前的景象，不明白这是怎么回事。几星期后，那雪崩一样的景象浮现在我的脑海里时，我不由感到好奇，很想知道那么小的雪球怎么变成了那样的庞然大物。自那时起，我便迷上了如何放大微小的力量。几年后，我着手研究机电共振的现象时，由于这个原因，一开始就抱有浓厚的兴趣。也许，如果没有对少年时的那件事情产生深刻的印象，那么，后来在发明线圈时我可能就不会深入研究那小小的电火花，也就不会有自己最杰出的发明成果了。这段经历容我细细道来（这也是第一次公布于世）。

那些巴结社会名流的人经常问我，我最重视自己的哪一项发明。这个问题见仁见智。不少技术人员在自己的小天地里游刃有余，可就是思想迂腐、鼠目寸光，认为除了感应电动机之外，我奉献给世界的其他发明没有什么实用价值。这就大错特错了！一种新构想的价值不能以它当时立竿见影的效果作为判断依据。我的交流电电力传输体系是经过长时间的探索，应运而生的，是为工业生产中的急迫问题提供的一个解决方案。尽管我还需要克服相当大的阻力，还需要照例协调各方的利益，但对它进行商业推广却是刻不容缓的。我发明涡轮机时就深陷在了这种处境中。人们会以为这样的发明简易大方又实用美观，具有理想电动机的种种特征，应该立刻被投入使用，可我后来的遭遇和我前面的经历是一样的。不过，旋转磁场的预期效用却不一样，它不会淘汰现有机器，反而会增加现有机器的使用价值。这一项目有利于新企业的发展，也可以推动旧企业的进步。我的涡轮机也是一种进步，但性质完全不同，是对过去旧东西的扬弃——它的成功就意味着要抛弃过去的老旧机型，而那些老旧机型曾经不知耗费了几百亿几千亿的真金白银。在这种情况下，必须循序渐进，慢慢地来。最大的困难恐怕就是那些心存偏见的专家的合力阻挠了。不久前的一天，我遇见了查尔斯·菲茨杰拉德·司各特（此人是我的朋友，也是我以前的助手，现在是耶鲁大学电机工程学教授），有了一段让人丧气的经历。我已经好久没见他了，乐得邀请他到办公室小叙。我们的谈话自然而然转到了我的涡轮机上。我心潮澎湃，激动万分，认为这是一项愿景辉煌的事业，于是大着嗓门说道：“司各特，我的涡轮机将会取代世界上所有的热力发动机！”司各特摸了摸下巴，若有所思地将目光移开，好像心里在盘算着什么，最后说了一句：“这下子，将会有大批的机器因此而报废。”随后，他再也没说什么就走了。

我的这些发明以及其他一些发明，其实只不过是朝着特定的方向迈进了几步罢了。在发明的过程中，我仅仅是凭着本能对现有的机械进行改进，并没有特别注意人类长远的需要。放大发射机则不然，它是我苦心经营多年的成果，其主要目的不仅仅是推动工业的发展，更是解决对人类而言有着无限重要性的问题。

如果没记错的话，那是在1890年11月，我在实验室进行了一项非同寻常的试验——那是一项《科学》年鉴中所记载的最为辉煌的试验。在研究高频电流时，我很兴奋地发现加大一定空间内电场的强度，可以点亮无极真空管。于是，我就造了一台变压器进行理论验证，结果第一次试验便大获成功。这些奇怪的现象究竟意味着什么，当时是很难看透的。人们渴望产生轰动效应，但很快就会对它们变得淡漠。昨天的奇迹，今天就会成为司空见惯的现象。当我第一次公开展示我的真空管时，观众惊讶万分，那时的情景简直无法描述。各种各样的邀请函像雪片一样从世界各地飞来，大量的荣誉和不乏溢美之词的诱惑也纷至沓来，而我都一一谢绝了。

但到了1892年，有些邀请我就是推也推不掉了。于是，我到伦敦去给电气工程师学会做了一次讲座。我原打算讲座结束后立刻到巴黎，再进行一次类似的演讲。可是詹姆士·德瓦爵士(1)坚持要我去给皇家学会做报告。我本是一个意志坚定的人，可还是架不住这位伟大的苏格兰科学家的有力劝说。他推着我，让我坐在了一把椅子上，给我倒了半杯奇妙无比的棕褐色饮品——那饮品还闪着彩虹色的光，味道似琼浆玉液。只听他说道：“你坐的是法拉第(2)坐过的椅子，喝的是他所喜欢喝的威士忌。”就这两点而言，那是一次令人艳羡的体验。次日傍晚，我向皇家学会展示了我的成果。报告会结束时，瑞利勋爵(3)致辞，他的慷慨陈词是世人对我的努力的第一次鼓励。为了躲避蜂拥而来的人们的追捧，我急匆匆从伦敦逃往巴黎，又从巴黎仓皇逃回了老家。到家后，我大病了一场，经受了巨大的痛苦和病痛的折磨。身体渐渐康复时，我开始筹划，准备到美国去继续搞我的研究。之前，我从不觉得自己具有发明创造的特别天赋，可是一直被我视为科学天才的瑞利勋爵却说我是一个有发明天赋的人。假如真如他所说的那样，我觉得自己应该集中精力拿出一些更大的构想。

一天，我在山里转悠，见天要下雨，就找了个地方躲雨。天空乌云密布，然而却迟迟不见雨落下来。突然间，一道闪电划过天空，不一会儿就下起了瓢泼大雨。这一现象使我陷入了沉思。很明显，闪电和雨是紧密相连的，是互为因果的。经过思考，我断定天空中的水分里蕴含着无法计量的电能，而闪电就像是一个灵敏的触发器，促使电能释放了出来。这一发现很可能会带来一项极为伟大的发明。假如能制造出我们所要求的特定质量的电能，地球以及地球上人们的生存状况便可以发生翻天覆地的变化。阳光使海水蒸发，然后由风能将它送往遥远的地区，以这样极其微妙的方式保持生态的平衡。如果我们能按自己选定的时间和地点打乱这种平衡状态，就可以随心所欲地控制这一强大的维持生命的水流，用以灌溉贫瘠的沙漠、人为地制造湖泊及河流，为人类提供无穷无尽的动力。这将是控制太阳能为人类所用的最为有效的方式。这一构想成功与否取决于我们是否有能力制造出大自然中的那样强大的电能。这似乎是一件无法办到的事情，但我决心做一下尝试，1892年夏天一回到美国就动手干了起来。这个项目对我极具吸引力，因为这样的能量输送方式跟我研究的无线输送电能是一样的，关乎无线输送电能的成功。

次年春，我初战告捷，取得了令人满意的成果，用我的圆锥形线圈制造出了约100万伏的电压。按现在的标准，那点儿电压算不了什么，但在当时却是一项壮举。这项研究稳步推进，直到1895年我的实验室毁于大火才戛然而止（此事可见T.C.马丁发表在《世纪》杂志4月刊的一篇文章）。这场火灾耽搁了我许多方面的研究。那年的我大部分时间都花在了做规划上，花在了重建实验室上。不过，条件一完备，我立刻重打锣鼓另开张干了起来。我虽然知道用大型仪器能够产生强大的电动势，但我也本能地感到，只要设计得当，相对小而精密的变压器也能达到这一目的。我在进行平螺旋绕组次级线圈试验时，电子束却没有出现（我的专利申请书中对此有所描述），这让我感到意外。没过多久我就发现这是由于线圈匝的位置发生改变，匝与匝之间的相互作用导致的。有感于这一发现，我在试验中采用了高压导体，导体里线圈匝的直径相当大，间距很宽，这样可以抑制分布电容，同时还可以避免任何位置出现电荷过分积压的现象。运用这一原理，我成功地制造出了400万伏的电压（这是我在休斯敦街新实验室做试验的极限值了，因为试验中电荷的释放距离可达16英尺）。这台发射机的图片登在了1898年11月的《电气评论》上。为了能沿着这条线索取得更大的进展，我的研究工作必须拿到户外去进行。1899年春，我做好了筹建无线电装置的工作，然后便去了科罗拉多，在那儿待了一年多。在科罗拉多，我对发射机又做了一些改进，使之更加完善，想要多大的电流，它就可以产生多大的电流。关于试验的情况，我写了一篇名为《关于增加人类电能的问题》的文章，1900年6月登在了《世纪》杂志上（这篇文章叙述的是科罗拉多的一次试验），感兴趣的读者可以从中了解详情。

《电气实验者》杂志请我详尽介绍这一项目，好让该杂志的年轻读者们清楚地了解我的“放大发射机”，了解它的构造、功能以及我建造它的目的。那就听我细细道来。首先，它是一个谐振变压器，其次级电路里的元件都具有很高的电势，分布面积广，排列在理想的包络面上，曲率半径非常大，相互间有适当的距离，以确保各处的电荷面密度都比较小——如此，即便导体裸露，也不会出现漏电的现象。这样的发射机适用于任何电频，小至每秒几周，大到每秒几千周，可用于生产电流量巨大电压较小的电流，也可用于生产电流强度小、电动势大的电流。电压的最大限度取决于负荷元件排列面曲率的高低以及排列面积的大小。

根据我以往的经验，高达一亿伏的电压是完全可以生产出来的。另外，还可以通过天线获得数千安培的电流。只需一套尺寸适中的装置便能够完成这一操作。从理论上来说，直径不到90英尺的端子，就可以产生那么大的电动势；通过直径不到30英尺的天线，便能够获得2000～4000安培的电流。

从狭义上讲，这种无线发射机的电磁波辐射与整体能量相比，小得几乎可以忽略不计——在这种情况下，阻尼因子极小，而电容度得到提升，能够贮存大量电荷。这样的电路，无论受到哪一种脉冲的冲击（哪怕是受到低频脉冲的冲击），都会像交流发电机一样产生持续不断的正弦振荡。

从狭小的价值看，它只不过是一台谐振变压器而已，但除了以上特性之外，它还能精确地进行调整以适应地球的电常数和电学特性，其无线传输能量的效率和能力因此可以得到大大提升，距离远完全不是问题，因为被输送的脉冲的强度不会因为距离过远而减弱。根据一条精确的数学定律，甚至距离越远，这种装置的性能反而越好。

这项发明是我的无线传输“世界系统”当中的一种，1900年返回纽约后，我便着手使之商业化。至于我立刻就要实现的目标，在当时的一份技术报告里有清楚的描述，此处摘录如下：

“世界系统”是若干项独创性发明的综合成果，是发明者经过长期探索和试验总结出来的。它不但能通过无线传输方式，即时精准地把任何一种信号、信息或文字传送到世界各地，还可以在不改变现有设备的情况下使得现有的电报、电话以及其他信号站互联互通。举例来说，以这种方式，当地的电话用户可以给这个地球上的任何一个电话用户打电话。只需要一个廉价的接收器，尺码并不比怀表大，便可以在任何一个地方（无论是在陆地上还是在海上）接听异地的讲演或音乐（不管那个地方有多远）。举这几个例子只是想说明这一伟大的科学发现的应用前景：它会消除距离的障碍，人们只需要通过一根电线，就可以让地球这个完美的天然导体发挥它的用武之地。其深远意义在于：任何通过一根或多根线（线路的长度显然是有限的）运作的仪器，都可以达到相同的效果，不需要人工导体，性能和精确度是一样的，除了地球的物理尺码之外，距离远近不受限制。采用这种理想的传输方式，不仅可以使商业活动获得崭新的发展空间，传统应用也可以得到巨大的改进和提高。

以下的重要发明和发现是开发利用“世界系统”的基础：

1.特斯拉变压器。这种仪器用于产生电振动，其意义之重大就跟火药用于战争一样。发明者用这种仪器生产的电流比用普通方式生产出的电流强许多倍，电火花的长度超过100英尺。

2.放大发射机。这是特斯拉最重要的发明，是一种特殊的变压器，专门用于刺激地球磁场以传输电能，传输距离之远得靠天文望远镜观察。采用这种神奇的仪器，他激发的电能比闪电的还要强，产生的电流足以点亮世界各地的200多盏白炽灯。

3.特斯拉无线系统。该系统包括若干项技术革新，是唯一不需要电线就能够远距离传输电能的方式，经济划算。发明者在科罗拉多建立了一个试验站，进行了精心的测试和计算，发现使用这一系统想传输多少电能就可以传输多少，如果需要，还可以绕地球传输电能，其中的损耗不超过几个百分点。

4.个性化技术。特斯拉的这一发明与原始的“调谐”相比，犹如精美的语言之于含混不清的粗话。它可以使信号或信息的传输完全保密，专人专用（对发出者和接受者均如此），也就是说十分安全，不受任何干扰。每一个信号都像一个身份明确无误的人。无数的信号站或仪器可以同时运行，数量不受限制，相互间无一丝一毫的干扰。

5.地球驻波。通俗地讲，这一意义重大的发现表明：地球会对有限波长的电振动做出反应，就像音叉对某些特定的音波做出反应一样。这样的电振动可以强烈地刺激地球磁场，对商业以及许多其他领域而言用途广泛、意义重大。

首套“世界系统”动力装置九个月内可投入运行，届时有望获得1000万马力的电能，不用花许多钱，却可以服务于许多技术项目，其中包括：

1.实现全世界现有电报交换机或交换站的互联互通；

2.为政府提供秘密、安全的电报服务项目；

3.实现全球现有电话交换机或交换站的互联互通；

4.和媒体建立联系，用电报或电话广泛传播一般性新闻；

5.用“世界系统”建立专门为私人服务的信息传递业务；

6.实现全世界证券报价机的互联互通，实现操作一致；

7.建立音乐广播等用途的“世界系统”；

8.用廉价的钟表便可以实现全球天文级精度的报时，不需要做任何调整；

9.在全球范围内传输打印或手写的字符，传输信件和支票等；

10.建立全球航海服务项目，使所有的船只都能够在没有指南针的情况下安全行驶，准确了解船只所在的位置、时间以及速度，防止撞船等灾难的发生；

11.创建全球范围的印刷体系；

12.在全球范围内实现对摄影图片、各种画作或记录的拷贝。

我还建议在小范围内演示无线电力传输技术，并取得了令世人信服的效果。除此之外，我的发明还有另外的一些更为重要的用途，这些会在将来的某一天向社会公布。

我在长岛建了一套装置，其中包括一座高187英尺的传输塔，塔上有一个直径约68英尺的球形端子。这种大型装置适合传输任何级别的能量。首次试运行，我们只使用了200千瓦到300千瓦的功率，但我打算以后上升到几千马力。这种发射机发射的是一种特殊性质的复波，为此我发明了一种独特的方法，能用电话控制任何级别的能量。

传输塔两年前已拆掉，但我的研究项目仍在继续进行，我准备再建一座在某些方面有所改进的传输塔。关于拆塔这件事，我希望澄清一个事实，社会上广泛流传着一种版本，说那是政府出于战备的考虑强行拆掉的。我要说这种流言会在一些人的心里惹出偏见——他们哪里知道30年前政府已经授予了我美国国籍，证书一直锁在保险柜里，而我的各种勋章、学历证书、学位证书、金质奖章以及其他的荣誉证件则放在几个旧箱子里。假如这种传言是有根据的，那我可以获得一大笔赔偿金，因为我建塔时花了不少钱。相反，保护塔才符合政府的利益，因为它可以为政府做许多事情——例如，它可以对世界上任何一个地方的潜艇进行定位。我的装置、研究项目以及所有的技术更新历来都是为官方服务的。自从欧战爆发以来，我牺牲了自己的时间，致力于空中导航、船舶推进以及无线传输方面的开发研究，这些对国家至关重要。那些了解内情的人知道，我的构想彻底改变了美国的工业。真不知有哪个发明家能跟我一样幸运——我的一些发明项目被用在了战场上。以前，我不愿公布这些细节，认为当整个世界都处于战乱期间，斤斤计较个人得失极为不妥。听说社会上流传着各种谣言，说约翰·皮尔庞特·摩根(4)对我的事业不感兴趣，对别的发明家却慷慨大方，一掷千金。对此，我需要做一说明：他对我的资助也很慷慨，不折不扣地履行了他的诺言，再叫他出更多的钱是极为不合理的。他极其看重我的成就，对我的能力坚信不疑，认为我最终一定能够实现当初设定的目标。一些小肚鸡肠的人嫉妒心强，想给我泼冷水，我可不能让他们得逞。这些人在我看来只不过是些传染疾病的细菌而已。我的研究项目受到自然法则的拖累而有所耽搁，整个世界对它还没有心理准备——它远远地走在了时代的前边。自然法则最终一定会帮助我，使我的研究大获成功。

第六章　探索自动遥控机械学


以放大发射机为基础的“世界系统”耗尽了我的心血，是我花费精力最大的一个项目，我怀疑自己脑神经的细小纤维都因此而受到了损害。年轻时，我曾致力于对旋转磁场的研究，也曾殚精竭虑、费力劳神，但早年的那些工作和这个项目相比性质是不同的。那时虽然也极度紧张，可是却不像此时这样必须时刻睁大眼睛、绷紧心里的弦，准备应对无线传输中所遇到的种种令人困惑的难题。尽管我的身体具有罕见的耐力，但我的脑神经却经受不住折磨，终于出了问题——就在这个旷日持久、困难重重的研究项目胜利在望时，我整个人彻底垮掉了。当我的创造力即将耗尽时，上天赐给了我一种保障安全的方法，而且这种方法似乎还在逐年臻于完善，我屡试不爽。毫无疑问，若非如此，我肯定会遭受更大的苦难，说不定我的职业生涯也会提前结束。只要这种方法行之有效，我便可以高枕无忧，不必担心会像其他的一些发明家那样过度劳累而死，也无须像大多数人那样必须休假缓解压力。一旦精力枯竭，我便学习黑人，像黑人那样坦然入睡（白人往往杂念丛生，难以进入梦乡）。在探索超出我的领域的新理论时，我的身体里可能会逐渐积聚一定数量的毒素，这种毒素常常会使我陷入昏昏欲睡的状态（这种状态会持续半个小时，一分钟也不差）。清醒过来后，我会觉得刚刚发生的事情成了很久之前的往事。如果我试图回到中断的思路上去，心里会感到一阵恶心。这样我就只好去干别的工作了。令人称奇的是，我的大脑变得十分清晰，可以轻而易举地解决在这之前困扰着我的难题。几个星期或几个月之后，我把热情又投放在暂时搁置的发明上，几乎不费吹灰之力就可以找到解决所有棘手问题的答案。关于这一点，我想讲一段非同寻常的往事，它也许会引起心理学学者的兴趣。通过使用地面发射机，我观察到了一种引人注目的现象，于是便试图找出答案，看它是否与地下电流有关。这似乎是无望之举。我废寝忘食地苦干了一年多，但一无所获。这项研究意义重大，需要我全身心投入，将其他的事情一概置于脑后，甚至忘了自己的健康状况正在每况愈下。最后，正当我眼看就要崩溃的时候，上天保护我，让我睡了救命的一觉。醒来后，我惊愕地发现：除了幼年时期最初进入我记忆中的一些事情，一生中其他的事情一概回忆不起来了。奇怪的是，那些浮现在我脑海里的事情简直清晰极了，这缓解了我紧绷的神经，令人高兴。每天夜里睡觉时，我都会回忆那些往事，越来越多早年的场景又出现在了我眼前。过去生活的画卷慢慢展开，而母亲一直都是中心人物。思母心切，我急于想见她，而这种情绪越来越浓，以致我最后决定放下手头的工作，要去实现这一愿望。可我发现要想离开实验室，比登天还难。几个月过去了，在这期间我成功地恢复了一些记忆，回忆起了1892年春天之前所出现的生活片段。在那如烟似雾的生活片段中，我仿佛看见自己躺在巴黎的和平大酒店，正准备进入我的那种特殊的睡眠状态（这是高度用脑之后的睡眠）。谁知就在这时，服务员送来一封急信，信上说家母已病危。这给我心里带来的痛苦和悲哀有多大，是可想而知的。记得当时我一刻也没耽搁，立即长途跋涉回到家，母亲在经过几个星期的病痛折磨后，最终还是与世长辞了！尤其让人感到奇怪的是，在回忆如烟往事的那段时间，我对涉及研究项目的方方面面特别敏感，能够记得清最小的细节以及在试验中所观察到的哪怕是最微不足道的现象，甚至连书上的文章以及复杂的数学公式也可以倒背如流。

我坚信在发明过程中存在一种补偿机制，真正的回报与你付出的劳动以及所作出的牺牲是成正比的。鉴于此因，我敢肯定在我的所有发明中，放大发射机一定会被证实对未来的人们具有极为重要的价值。我之所以有这种预言，倒不是觉得它势必会引发商业革命和工业革命，而是认为它会帮助人类取得许多成就。纯粹的实用价值，与推动人类更高层次的文明进步相比是不可同日而语的。我们所面临的问题是很复杂的，单靠提供物质方面的东西（不管它们是多么丰富）是不能够解决的。相反，物质的丰富反而会带来威胁，其危险程度不亚于物质的匮乏和贫穷。假如我们只是一味地释放原子能量，或者寻找出一种办法在地球的某处开发出廉价且无限的能源，这不一定是福，反而会惹出祸来，导致纠纷和混乱，最终使得遭人痛恨的强权大行其道。技术创新的伟大之处在于致力于人类团结与和谐的美好愿望，而我的放大发射器正是如此。有了它，人的声音和图像可以传播到任何一个地方，瀑布可以为千里之外的工厂提供动力，飞行器可以不间断地在地球各处飞行。通过它可以控制太阳能用以创造湖泊及河流来满足人类的需要，将干旱的沙漠变为良田。用于电报、电话及类似的领域，它可以排除静力以及其他的干扰——目前，这些干扰限制了无线电技术的应用。这是一个亟待解决的问题，寥寥数语不足以展开充分阐述。

在过去的10年当中，有不少人不可一世地宣称自己已经将障碍排除。在他们的结论还未公布之前，我就对其所有的步骤进行了研究，并对其中的多数进行了试验，但发现无一可行。美国海军最近发表了一篇正式声明对这些结论予以驳斥，这对一些盲目轻信的新闻编辑来说是一个教训，教他们识别什么样的研究结论才是真正有价值的。那些研究的基础理论几乎全都荒谬不堪，让人见了不由得嗤之以鼻。前不久又有一项新发现公布出来，吵得沸沸扬扬，末了还是雷声大雨点小，成了一场闹剧。这让我想起了几年前发生的一件令人兴奋的事情。当时我正在做高频电流实验，而史蒂夫·布罗迪(1)刚刚从布鲁克林大桥跳了下去。跳桥的壮举为多人所效仿，未免流于庸俗。但此事第一次被报道出来时，在纽约引起了轰动效应。对此我印象很深，常常提起那位勇敢的印刷工。一个炎热的下午，我觉得有必要让自己放松一下，于是便走进了这座大城市里3万个著名机构中的一个。这儿有酒精度含量为12％的饮料（如今，只有跑到欧洲的那些贫穷落后的国家才能喝得到这样的饮料）。餐馆里食客很多，都不是什么显要人物，大家都在议论一个问题。我一语惊四座，随口说了句：“我从桥上跳下去的时候也是这么说的。”(2)话一出口，我觉得自己就像席勒诗歌里提摩太的那个伙伴，遭到了众人的误解。顿时，餐馆里沸腾了起来，十几个人高喊：“他是布罗迪！”我把一枚25分的硬币朝柜台上一扔，向门外冲去，而众人紧追不舍，口里大喊：“请你站住，史蒂夫！”他们误解我了，在我一路狂奔寻找藏身之地时，许多路人试图拦住我。后来拐了几个弯，我总算从一个消防通道幸运脱身，回到了实验室。一进门，我就脱掉外套，伪装成一个正在起劲干活的铁匠，干起活来。不过，这样的防范措施是没有必要的，因为那些追我的人早已被我甩掉了。事情过去许多年之后，我夜里辗转反侧睡不着觉、胡思乱想时，回忆起那天的情景，不禁暗忖：那些人要是撵上我，发现我不是史蒂夫·布罗迪，我的命运会怎么样呢？

近来有位工程师在给一个技术协会做报告时，声称自己根据一种“迄今为止尚无人知的原理”发现了克服静电干扰的方法。他说发射机的电流穿过地表时，静电干扰上下波动——这样的结论似乎有点儿草率，就跟我当年在餐馆嘴上没有把门的一样。按照他的说法，被大气层环绕的地球是一个电容器，既能充电又可以放电——这种观点与任何一本物理教科书里的基础理论都是相悖的。这样的假设即便在富兰克林(3)时代也会被人们斥为一种谬论，因为彼时这方面的知识已广为人知，大气中的电流与机器产生的电流相等已成定论。显而易见，自然和人工静电干扰无论是在地球上还是在空中，其波动方式都是一样的，二者在水平方向和垂直方向都会产生电动势。他所提到的办法是不可能排除干扰的。事实是：电动势在空中每提高一英尺就会增加大约50伏，所以天线上下端的电压差可以高达2万伏，甚至4万伏。带电气团不间断地运动，把电能传送给导体（这样的传送并非持续的，而是间断性的），使得敏感的电话接收器里产生了吱吱啦啦的摩擦声。电路的端子越高，覆盖的范围就越大，效果就越显著。不过，应该指出的是：这仅仅是局部效应，不会对整个系统造成麻烦。1900年，为了完善无线传输系统，我在一套装置上安装了四根天线，并对天线进行认真的校准，将它们调整为相同的频率，且相互连接起来，确保无论从哪个方向接收到的信号都能被放大。如果想找出传输过来的脉冲之源头，我就把每一对按对角线排列的天线与一个初级线圈连接形成组合，构成一个检测线路。在前一种情况下，话筒里接收到的声音很大；但在后一种情况下，正如我所料，听不见一点儿声音，因为两根天线相互作用，把声音抵消了。不过，两种情况下都有静电出现，我必须设计出具体结构来体现不同的原理。

很久以前我就提出过把接收器与地面上的两个接收点连接在一起，这样就能避免现有结构中由带电空气导致的严重故障。而且由于电路方向的作用，所有的干扰几乎都会减弱一半。这样的道理是不言而喻的，但对一些头脑简单的无线电研究人员还是有一定的启发作用的——那些人的实验也只不过是在无线电装置的形式上做文章，他们认为用一把斧子就可以解决问题。他们面对问题时的处理方式有点儿混乱，往往还没有杀死狗熊，就已经开始处理它的皮了。如果真的是因为天线的干扰而产生了这种怪现象，那么使用无线接收方式岂不就可以将这一问题轻而易举地消除掉！而实际上，按这种说法，埋在地下的电线必须彻底绝缘，因为它比垂直架在空中的天线更容易受到某种外来脉冲的影响。说句公道话，这是一种小小的进步，在方式方法上并无实质性改变——它只不过摈弃了传输性能差、完全不适合用于接收的庞大结构，采用了一种比较合适的接收器罢了。正如我在以前的一篇文章中所说的那样，要想一了百了地解决这一难题，就得彻底改变整个系统，越快越好。

实际上，如果一种技术尚处于萌芽状态，广大公众（甚至包括专家）对其最后的可能性尚不明确，就匆匆忙忙地采取立法手段使其成为政府垄断的技术，一定会导致灾难性后果。几个星期前，国务卿丹尼尔斯提出了政府垄断的方案。这位杰出的官员在向参议院和众议院陈述时信心百倍，话语铿锵。不过，大量证据清楚地表明：最佳的研究成果历来都产生于健康的商业竞争。至于无线电技术，更有理由予以它充分的自由发展空间。首先，对于改善人类的生活，它有着不可限量的前景，比人类历史上任何一项发明和发现都伟大，都重要。再者，我们必须知道这一伟大的技术完全诞生和发展于美国，因而可以被称为“美国造”——它比电话、白炽灯或飞机更有资格和底气获得这样的称呼。一些雄心勃勃的媒体人和股票经纪人竟罔顾事实，散布虚假信息——甚至就连《科学美国人》这样脍炙人口的期刊也倾向于将主要功劳归于外国。当然，赫兹波是德国人发现的，俄国、英国、法国和意大利的专家们很快就把它用在了发射信号上。他们用的固然是新媒介，但感应线圈却是原有的，没有任何改变——这几乎就仅仅是给反光通信法换了一种形式而已。我在1891年就提出：这样做，信号的传输半径非常有限，所产生的结果价值不大，用声波取代赫兹振荡作为传输媒介会更好。此外，在无线电基础原理被提出来三年之后，我在这方面进行了种种尝试，在美国对我所使用的仪器进行了清晰的描述，并进行了开发，其成果如今已得到了广泛应用。目前，赫兹波的研究仪器和方法已荡然无存，没有留下任何痕迹。我们选择的方向完全相反——这是美国人民的智慧和劳动的结晶。一旦原始专利到期，任何人都可以利用这项技术。那位国务卿提出垄断方案，主要是怕受到干扰。7月29日的《纽约先驱报》发文说，根据国务卿的观点，信号站所发出的信号可以受到世界上任何一个村庄的信号站的干扰。如此看来，根据我在1900年做的实验，在美国设定限制是一点儿用都没有的。

对于这种情况，我想做一下解释，讲一讲最近发生的一件事。一天，有个看上去有点儿怪的人找上门来，说想请我到一个偏远的地区筹建世界发射机。他说：“我们没有现金，却有的是黄金，一定会用重金酬谢。”我回答说我想先在美国完成这里的发明项目。至此，我们的谈话就结束了。但我看到黑暗势力在兴风作浪，保持通信的畅通会变得越来越难。唯有抗干扰的通信体系才能力挽狂澜。这种体系已经有了，并且已经完善，我们所要做的就是将其投入使用。

人们最关心的问题仍然是可怕的战争，而放大发射机可以用于进攻和防御，也许能够在战争中发挥极其重要的作用，尤其跟遥控机械连在一起更是如此。这项发明起于我的童年时代，贯穿了我的一生，是长期观察和研究的结晶。当第一批成果公布时，《电气评论》撰文称这项发明将会是“人类进步史和文明史里一种最强大的推动力量”。这一预言用不了多久便会实现。1898年和1900年，这项发明两次被提交给政府，如果我是一个投其所好、愿意按他们的心意办事的人，也许这项发明就被采纳了。当时，我真心地认为：这一发明具有强大的杀伤力，不用投入一兵一卒就可以消除战争。可现在，尽管我对它的潜力仍未丧失信心，但我的看法却改变了。

战争是不可避免的，除非引发战争的物质因素得以消除——归根结底，这种物质因素就是我们生活的地球的空间。只有从各个方面消除了距离问题，如消除信息传递、旅客运输、能源供应和输送等各方面的差异，才能有朝一日消除战争，使人与人之间永久地保持友好的关系。我们热切盼望全世界人与人、国与国之间能加强联系，增进了解，消除狂热的极端思想和自私的民粹主义，因为历来都是这些因素在兴风作浪，让世界陷入原始的野蛮状态，使得冲突不断。任何一种联盟或议会法案都无法阻止这种战乱的发生。而这些杀伤力巨大的新设备只能进一步叫弱者听任强者蹂躏。早在14年前，我就提出过这样的观点。当时，几个大国联合起来，准备建立一种所谓的神圣联盟。方案由现在已故的安德鲁·卡内基(4)提出——此人可以被称为这一思想之父。他在宣传和推广方面比任何人都卖力，并促使总统采取了行动。毋庸置疑，这一方案对一些弱势民族不无好处，然而却无法实现核心目标。只有天下大同、各民族团结，才能最终实现和平，但这一极乐的目标离我们仍然很远。依我之见，当今世界存在着巨大的冲突，如果美国能一如既往，不陷入“结盟的旋涡”，就是全人类最大的福祉。美国在地理位置上远离即将发生的大战，又没有扩张领土的动机，国内有着用之不尽的资源和深受自由及民权思想浸润的千千万万人民，可谓得天独厚。因此，它完全可以独立地施展它强大的实力及道德力量，为全人类谋福利，这样做比跟别的国家结盟更为明智、更为有效。

我有一篇文章讲的是我的生活，发表在《电气实验者》上。我在那篇文章里回忆了自己早年的生活，说一场病痛刺激了我，使我不断地幻想和自我反省。这种心理活动起初是在病痛的刺激下无意识发生的，后来逐渐演变成了我的第二天性。最后，我才意识到这只不过是机械行为，缺乏主观能动性，仅仅是对环境影响的反应。我们的身体结构极其复杂，行为方式多种多样，外部印象对我们的感官产生的影响非常微妙、难以捉摸，一般人很难发现这一事实。而训练有素的调查者认为最可信的还是机械生命论——这一理论在某种程度上而言是笛卡儿(5)在300年前总结和提出来的。不过，在他那个时代，人们还不了解自己身体的许多重要功能，尤其光的性质、人眼的构造及运动形式，可以说，科学家们生活在一片黑暗之中。近年来，这些领域的科学研究突飞猛进，有大量专著问世，这一观点已不容置疑。也许，巴斯德教授(6)的前助手菲利克斯·莱·丹泰克的论述最有力，最雄辩。雅克·洛布(7)对趋日性进行了卓有成效的实验，清楚地阐述了光线对低等生物是具有控制力的，他的新书《受到强迫的行为》很能启发人。科学家们欣然接受了这一理论，就跟他们接受其他已被证实的理论一样，而我则不然——对我而言，这是我每时每刻都在用身心感受着的客观现实。我的心里时时刻刻都在感受着外部的影响，并因此而采取行动（实质性的或思维方面的）。只有在很少的情况下，我的注意力高度集中时，才难以觉察那发自内心深处的冲动。

对于周围的环境以及自身体内所出现的情况，大多数人都一无所知，数以百万计的人因此而患病，过早地离开人世。最常见的日常现象在他们看来是那么神秘和令人费解。一个人也许会突然感到忧伤，绞尽脑汁也找不到原因，岂不知那是由于一朵乌云遮住了阳光而引起的。在有些情况下，你的眼前可能会出现一位好友的影子，让你觉得十分蹊跷，因为你刚刚才在街上遇见他，或者在什么地方看过他的照片。有时，一个人丢了颗领扣，想不起怎么丢的，一时也无法找到，于是便发起了无名之火，一个劲地骂娘，甚至因此而想不起以前的事，不能找到所需要的东西。不善于观察只不过是愚昧无知的一种表现形式，是产生诸多病态观念和愚蠢思想的根源。只有不超过1/10的人不相信心灵感应以及其他的通灵现象，不相信死人的灵性以及与亡者的交流，拒绝倾听有意或无意的虚妄之说。这样的意识倾向甚至在一些头脑清晰的美国人心中也已经根深蒂固，此处不妨举一件滑稽的事情为例加以说明。

战前不久，我的涡轮机在这座城市展出，引发了各家技术领域报纸的广泛评论。根据我的预测，为了能获得这项发明的使用权，制造商们将会展开一场角逐。我特意制订了一套方案，准备迎接底特律的一位制造商（此人神通广大，善于敛财聚富）。我坚信他总有一天会露面的，并胸有成竹地把此想法告诉了我的秘书和助手。果不其然，在一个晴朗的上午，福特汽车公司的一群工程师蜂拥而至，说是要跟我谈一项重要的业务。“我说的没错吧？”我得意扬扬地对我的雇员说。其中的一个雇员答道：“你简直料事如神，特斯拉先生，一切都跟你提前说的一样。”这些头脑清晰的工程师屁股刚一坐稳，我当然立刻就开始为我的涡轮机大唱赞歌，历数它的神奇之处了。谁知他们竟然打断了我的话，说道：“这些我们都很清楚，只不过我们此行有一项特殊的使命。我们成立了一个心理学会，专门研究心理现象，希望你能加入。”那些工程师恐怕永远也不会知道，我当时差点儿把他们轰出我的办公室。

很多人告诉我，说我有一个非同寻常的大脑，这些人都是当代最伟大的科学家和取得了不朽成就的学科领袖。自那以后，我就不顾一切、不遗余力地试图解决一些重大问题。多年来，我致力于解决死亡之谜，睁大眼睛想观察到灵异现象的出现。但我一生中只有一次那样的经历，它瞬间给我留下了一个有关超自然的印象。那件事发生在家母去世的时候。当时，由于痛苦和长时间的失眠，我已彻底累垮。一天夜里，他们将我抬到了一个离我们家两个街区远的房屋里。我无助地躺在那儿，心想：我离开了母亲的病床，假如她在这个时候死去，肯定会给我一个提示的。两三个月前，我和好友威廉·克鲁克斯爵士(8)（此人现已作古）在伦敦谈起了唯灵论（这种学说对我影响很深）。别人的观点我可以不听，但对他的理论却深信不疑，因为我在学生时代就读过他的那本关于放射性物质的具有划时代意义的著作（正因如此，我选择了电气事业）。此时，我觉得正是窥探来世的最佳时间，因为我母亲是个天才，特别擅长运用精神感召力。那天，我一整夜都在盼望着奇异现象的出现，大脑的每根神经都绷得紧紧的，可是什么事情也没有发生。次日清晨，我进入了梦乡（也许是昏了过去），就在这时看见一群非常美丽的天使脚踩祥云出现了，其中的一个用慈爱的目光望着我，望着望着她就变成了我母亲的模样。她从我眼前飘然走过，随后就消失了，接着传来无比悦耳的歌声，使我从梦中醒了过来。刹那间，我确信母亲刚刚离开了人世（这种感觉是无法用语言形容的）。这些情况都是真的，我却无法理解事先出现的那些异常沉重、异常痛苦的预兆，于是我在这些印象还没有消失、身体状况仍很差的情况下给威廉·克鲁克斯爵士写了封信。恢复健康后，我花了很长时间寻找导致这种奇异现象的外部原因，结果一无所获。在许多个月过后，我终于如愿，这令我大大松了口气。我曾看到过一位著名艺术家的画作，用祥云以寓言的形式表现季节，一群天使驾云飘然行走在天空中，这幅画给我留下了很深的印象。这样的画面出现在了我的睡梦里，只是其中的一个天使换上了我母亲的相貌。至于歌声，那是复活节早晨附近一座教堂的唱诗班正在唱弥撒曲。这样就解释了一切，与客观现实完全相符。

此事已过去许久。这种心理和精神方面的异常情况虽然没有什么理论基础，但我仍坚信不疑，丝毫没有改变自己的看法。这种信念是人类智慧的自然延伸。人们对宗教教义的理解，不再仅局限于其传统信条的解释，每一个人都免不了坚持某种宗教信仰，相信上天那至高无上的力量。我们必须有信仰，以此规范自己的行为，获得心理上的满足。这种信仰应该是非物质的，不管是宗教的、艺术的、科学的抑或其他方面的，只要它具有净化精神的力量和功效就行。要实现全人类和平共处的目标，人类应该有一个共同的信仰。

虽然，我没有获得任何证据以支持心理学家和精神学家的那些观点，但我却极为满意地证明了生命是具有自动反应性的，这不仅是我通过对个体行为进行不断的观察所得出的结论，更是对普遍现象的总结归纳。通过观察，我有了一个发现，也许对人类社会有着极其重大的意义，容我在此对这一发现进行一下简单的回顾。在我还很年轻的时候，我就对这一令人吃惊的现象有了最初的感受和了解，但许多年里我都以为自己看到的仅仅是偶然现象。这一发现即：每当我自己、跟我亲近的人，抑或我所投身的事业受到伤害时（通俗地讲，这是极为不公平的遭遇），我就会感到一种特殊的、难以名状的痛苦（找不到合适的词加以形容，就称它为“广泛的痛苦”吧）。过不了多久，施害者就会无一例外地吃苦头。有了多次这样的经历之后，我把自己逐渐形成的理论讲给几位朋友听，他们经过验证，也相信了这一理论的真实性。这一理论可以用以下一段话概括：

人类的身体结构是类似的，受到相同的外部影响时，会做出共同的反应，采取一致的行动，这是我们制定所有的社会以及其他方面法律规则的基础。我们就像机器人，完全被媒介的力量操纵，宛若水面上随波浮动的软木塞，会把受控制错当成自由意志。我们的一举一动、一言一行都是出于生命的本能，看上去似乎各不相干，其实有看不见的纽带把我们紧紧相连。只要身体机能处于正常状态，它就会对外部刺激做出精确的反应。不过，一旦某个人的身体失常，他的自我保护能力就会受损。当然，人人都知道，一个人如果失聪、失明或四肢受伤，他生存的概率就会打折扣。还有一点也是事实，也许是更确凿的事实：大脑如果受损，在某种程度上失去了至关紧要的自动反应能力，就会因此迅速衰亡。一个非常敏感、具有很强观察力的人，其机械反应能力高度发达、完好无损，就可以利用他超凡的感官对周围环境的变化做出精确反应，得以避开无法直接观察到的潜在危险。一旦接触到控制性感官严重受损的人，他就会做出反应，产生那种“广泛的痛苦”。

这一理论已经过了数百次验证，我还请自然学的学者们关注这种现象，坚信通过大家的共同努力及系统的研究，它一定会给全世界带来不可估量的价值。

我老早就想建造一台自动机证实我的理论，但直到1893年着手无线电研究时，才实施这一想法。在接下来的两三年中，我发明了好几台遥控的自动机器，并在我的实验室里向人们演示。1896年，我设计了一台能够执行多项操作的机器，不过这台机器的改进工作一直持续到1897年底。这台机器1898年年初一出现在公众面前，便引起了轰动，其效应超过了我其他的所有发明项目。随后，我撰文对这台机器的性能进行了解释和说明，发表在1900年6月的《世纪》杂志以及其他一些期刊上。鉴于我对这台机器的陈述似乎有点儿匪夷所思，总审查官还特意跑到了纽约来，亲眼看了这台机器的运行情况，这才于1898年11月为我这项奇异的技术授予了基本专利。后来，记得有一次我去华盛顿拜访一位官员，想把这项发明献给政府。我把自己已经完成的研究讲给他听，竟惹得他哈哈大笑起来。那个时候，谁也不会相信我能够建造出这样的装置。不幸的是，我听从律师的建议，申请专利时竟然说这套装置是受一条独立线路以及一种广为人知的探测器控制的。这样，我的设计方法和构造方式一直未能得到专利的保护。其实，我的装置是由多条线路联合控制的，如此便不会受到任何一种干扰的影响。我用的多为环形接收电路，其中还包括电容器，因为高压发射机发出的电流会使大厅里的空气电离化，甚至一根小小的天线也能从周围的空气中吸收电量达数小时之久。此处不妨举一个例子说明这个概念：一个使用了很长时间的直径为12英寸的闪光灯，只有一个端子与一根短线相连，这种情况下仍能连续闪烁1000次，才会将实验室里电离化空气所含的电量全部吸收。环形接收器对这种干扰并不敏感，但奇怪的是它近来大受热捧。其实，它接收的能量远低于天线或接地长线，不过它却有一个功效——弥补目前无线电装置所固有的若干缺陷。在当众展示我的发明成果时，我让参观者随便提问，问什么都可以，说自动机会通过信号回答问题。这在当时被认为是一种不可思议的魔力，其实简单得不能再简单了——回答问题的是我本人，只不过借助机器传输罢了。

在这一时期，我还建了一艘体积比较大的遥控船，照片登载在当时的那一期《电气实验者》上。该船受线圈操纵，船体上绕了几圈电线。电线是完全防水的，遥控船可以在水下航行。这套装置与最初的那一套相似，但多了一些特殊的功能——例如，我安装了一些白炽灯，以便人们清楚地观察机器的运行情况。

不过，这些自动机是在操纵者看得见的地方运行的，只是我所构想的遥控技术领域的第一步，也是非常不成熟的一步。下一步就是对它进行改造，使这种自动遥控装置能在操纵者的视力范围以外运行，拉大它到控制中心的距离。设计之初我就有意将它用作作战的武器，以取代枪炮。它的重要作用似乎已得到了认可，虽然媒体对这种装置的评论很随意，说它是一项非常特别的发明，但缺乏新颖性。尽管它尚不完善，但实用性强，用现有的无线电装置就可以控制飞机，让飞机沿着一定的方向飞行，大体不偏离航向，并在数百英里之外执行任务。这一装置还可以通过几种不同的机械方式来控制，我毫不怀疑它将来一定能在战场上施展神威。不过，据我所知，目前我们还不能对它实现非常精确的控制。我花了多年的时间从事相关研究，寻觅解决问题的途径，致力于实现这一伟大、神奇的目标。

正如上文所述，上大学时我就在构想一种与现在的飞机截然不同的飞行器。此项设计的基本原理是很好的，然而却无法付诸实践，原因是缺乏功率强大的发动机。近几年，我成功地解决了这一难题。目前我正在设计一种飞行器，这种飞行器没有机翼、副翼、螺旋桨以及其他外部附件，却能够以极高的速度飞行，在不久的将来它很可能会为人类的和平做出巨大贡献。这样的飞行器完全靠反作用力支撑和驱动，可以用机械方式控制，也可以用无线电控制。通过安装适当的装置，就可以将这种类型的导弹发射到空中，让导弹落在几千英里之外的指定位置。但我们不会就此止步。具有高度智能化的远程自动遥控机最终一定会被造出来的——它的出现必将引发一场革命。早在1898年我就向一家大型企业的代表提出建议，让他们建造和推广一种自动运载装置，这种装置可以根据自身的判断完成各种操作。但在当时，我的建议显得不切合实际，于是未被采纳。

目前，许多有识之士都在搜肠刮肚地寻找救世良方，防止在理论上已经结束的可怕的战争死灰复燃。我曾在1914年12月20日的《太阳报》上发表文章，对战争持续的时间以及引发战争的主要原因进行过准确预测。他们建议的成立国际联盟其实并非救世良方，相反，一些精英人物还认为这可能会产生负面效应。尤其让人感到遗憾的是，他们在拟定和平条款时还需要带有惩罚性政策。岂不知用不了几年，国家之间的战争就不需要动用军队、军舰和枪炮了，取而代之的武器的杀伤力要可怕得多，覆盖范围几乎是无限的。敌人可以在任意距离外摧毁一座城市，这是世界上任何力量都无法阻止的。要想防止灾难的发生，防止地球变成人间地狱，我们就应该刻不容缓地采取行动，动用全国的力量和资源，加速开发遥控飞行器和无线能量传输装置。

Chapter 1　My Early Life


The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements.

Speaking for myself, I have already had more than my full measure of this exquisite enjoyment, so much that for many years my life was little short of continuous rapture. I am credited with being one of the hardest workers and perhaps I am, if thought is the equivalent of labor, for I have devoted to it almost all of my waking hours. But if work is interpreted to be a definite performance in a specified time according to a rigid rule, then I may be the worst of idlers. Every effort under compulsion demands a sacrifice of life-energy. I never paid such a price. On the contrary, I have thrived on my thoughts.

In attempting to give a connected and faithful account of my activities in this series of articles which will be presented with the assistance of the Editors of the Electrical Experimenter and are chiefly addrest to our young men readers, I must dwell, however reluctantly, on the impressions of my youth and the circumstances and events which have been instrumental in determining my career.

Our first endeavors are purely instinctive, promptings of an imagination vivid and undisciplined. As we grow older reason asserts itself and we become more and more systematic and designing. But those early impulses, although not immediately productive, are of the greatest moment and may shape our very destinies. Indeed, I feel now that had I understood and cultivated instead of suppressing them, I would have added substantial value to my bequest to the world. But not until I had attained manhood did I realize that I was an inventor.

This was due to a number of causes. In the first place I had a brother who was gifted to an extraordinary degree—one of those rare phenomena of mentality which biological investigation has failed to explain. His premature death left my parents disconsolate. We owned a horse which had been presented to us by a dear friend. It was a magnificent animal of Arabian breed, possessed of almost human intelligence, and was cared for and petted by the whole family, having on one occasion saved my father's life under remarkable circumstances. My father had been called one winter night to perform an urgent duty and while crossing the mountains, infested by wolves, the horse became frightened and ran away, throwing him violently to the ground. It arrived home bleeding and exhausted, but after the alarm was sounded immediately dashed off again, returning to the spot, and before the searching party were far on the way they were met by my father, who had recovered consciousness and remounted, not realizing that he had been lying in the snow for several hours. This horse was responsible for my brother's injuries from which he died. I witnessed the tragic scene and although 56 years have elapsed since, my visual impression of it has lost none of its force. The recollection of his attainments made every effort of mine seem dull in comparison.

Anything I did that was creditable merely caused my parents to feel their loss more keenly. So I grew up with little confidence in myself. But I was far from being considered a stupid boy, if I am to judge from an incident of which I have still a strong remembrance. One day the Aldermen were passing through a street where I was at play with other boys. The oldest of these venerable gentlemen—a wealthy citizen—paused to give a silver piece to each of us. Coming to me he suddenly stopped and commanded, “Look in my eyes.” I met his gaze, my hand outstretched to receive the much valued coin, when, to my dismay, he said, “No, not much, you can get nothing from me, you are too smart.” They used to tell a funny story about me. I had two old aunts with wrinkled faces, one of them having two teeth protruding like the tusks of an elephant which she buried in my cheek every time she kissed me. Nothing would scare me more than the prospect of being hugged by these as affectionate as unattractive relatives. It happened that while being carried in my mother's arms they asked me who was the prettier of the two. After examining their faces intently, I answered thoughtfully, pointing to one of them, “This here is not as ugly as the other.”

Then again, I was intended from my very birth for the clerical profession and this thought constantly oppressed me. I longed to be an engineer but my father was inflexible. He was the son of an officer who served in the army of the Great Napoleon and, in common with his brother, professor of mathematics in a prominent institution, had received a military education but, singularly enough, later embraced the clergy in which vocation he achieved eminence. He was a very erudite man, a veritable natural philosopher, poet and writer and his sermons were said to be as eloquent as those of Abraham a Sancta-Clara. He had a prodigious memory and frequently recited at length from works in several languages. He often remarked playfully that if some of the classics were lost he could restore them. His style of writing was much admired. He penned sentences short and terse and was full of wit and satire. The humorous remarks he made were always peculiar and characteristic. Just to illustrate, I may mention one or two instances. Among the help there was a cross-eyed man called Mane, employed to do work around the farm. He was chopping wood one day. As he swung the axe my father, who stood nearby and felt very uncomfortable, cautioned him, “For God's sake, Mane, do not strike at what you are looking but at what you intend to hit.” On another occasion he was taking out for a drive a friend who carelessly permitted his costly fur coat to rub on the carriage wheel. My father reminded him of it saying, “Pull in your coat, you are ruining my tire.” He had the odd habit of talking to himself and would often carry on an animated conversation and indulge in heated argument, changing the tone of his voice. A casual listener might have sworn that several people were in the room.

Although I must trace to my mother's influence whatever inventiveness I possess, the training he gave me must have been helpful. It comprised all sorts of exercises—as, guessing one another's thoughts, discovering the defects of some form or expression, repeating long sentences or performing mental calculations. These daily lessons were intended to strengthen memory and reason and especially to develop the critical sense, and were undoubtedly very beneficial.

My mother descended from one of the oldest families in the country and a line of inventors. Both her father and grandfather originated numerous implements for household, agricultural and other uses. She was a truly great woman, of rare skill, courage and fortitude, who had braved the storms of life and past through many a trying experience. When she was 16 years old a virulent pestilence swept the country. Her father was called away to administer the last sacraments to the dying and during his absence she went alone to the assistance of a neighboring family who were stricken by the dread disease. All of the members, five in number, succumbed in rapid succession. She bathed, clothed and laid out the bodies, decorating them with flowers according to the custom of the country and when her father returned he found everything ready for a Christian burial. My mother was an inventor of the first order and would, I believe, have achieved great things had she not been so remote from modern life and its multifold opportunities. She invented and constructed all kinds of tools and devices and wove the finest designs from thread which was spun by her. She even planted the seeds, raised the plants and separated the fibers herself. She worked indefatigably, from break of day till late at night, and most of the wearing apparel and furnishings of the home was the product of her hands. When she was past 60 years old, her fingers were still nimble enough to tie three knots in an eyelash.

There was another and still more important reason for my late awakening. In my boyhood I suffered from a peculiar affliction due to the appearance of images, often accompanied by strong flashes of light, which marred the sight of real objects and interfered with my thought and action. They were pictures of things and scenes which I had really seen, never of those I imagined. When a word was spoken to me the image of the object it designated would present itself vividly to my vision and sometimes I was quite unable to distinguish whether what I saw was tangible or not. This caused me great discomfort and anxiety. None of the students of psychology or physiology whom I have consulted could ever explain satisfactorily these phenomena. They seem to have been unique although I was probably predisposed as I know that my brother experienced a similar trouble. The theory I have formulated is that the images were the result of a reflex action from the brain on the retina under great excitation. They certainly were not hallucinations such as are produced in diseased and anguished minds, for in other respects I was normal and composed. To give an idea of my distress, suppose that I had witnessed a funeral or some such nerve-racking spectacle. Then, inevitably, in the stillness of night, a vivid picture of the scene would thrust itself before my eyes and persist despite all my efforts to banish it. Sometimes it would even remain fixed in space though I pushed my hand through it. If my explanation is correct, it should be able to project on a screen the image of any object one conceives and make it visible. Such an advance would revolutionize all human relations. I am convinced that this wonder can and will be accomplished in time to come; I may add that I have devoted much thought to the solution of the problem.

To free myself of these tormenting appearances, I tried to concentrate my mind on something else I had seen, and in this way I would often obtain temporary relief; but in order to get it I had to conjure continuously new images. It was not long before I found that I had exhausted all of those at my command; my “reel” had run out, as it were, because I had seen little of the world—only objects in my home and the immediate surroundings. As I performed these mental operations for the second or third time, in order to chase the appearances from my vision, the remedy gradually lost all its force. Then I instinctively commenced to make excursions beyond the limits of the small world of which I had knowledge, and I saw new scenes. These were at first very blurred and indistinct, and would flit away when I tried to concentrate my attention upon them, but by and by I succeeded in fixing them; they gained in strength and distinctness and finally assumed the concreteness of real things. I soon discovered that my best comfort was attained if I simply went on in my vision farther and farther, getting new impressions all the time, and so I began to travel—of course, in my mind. Every night (and sometimes during the day), when alone, I would start on my journeys—see new places, cities and countries—live there, meet people and make friendships and acquaintances and, however unbelievable, it is a fact that they were just as dear to me as those in actual life and not a bit less intense in their manifestations.

This I did constantly until I was about 17 years old when my thoughts turned seriously to invention. Then I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind. Thus I have been led unconsciously to evolve what I consider a new method of materializing inventive concepts and ideas, which is radically opposite to the purely experimental and is in my opinion ever so much more expeditious and efficient. The moment one constructs a device to carry into practice a crude idea he finds himself unavoidably engrossed with the details and defects of the apparatus. As he goes on improving and reconstructing, his force of concentration diminishes and he loses sight of the great underlying principle. Results may be obtained but always at the sacrifice of quality.

My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no difference whatever, the results are the same. In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in the invention every possible improvement I can think of and see no fault anywhere, I put into concrete form this final product of my brain. Invariably my device works as I conceived that it should, and the experiment comes out exactly as I planned it. In 20 years there has not been a single exception. Why should it be otherwise? Engineering, electrical and mechanical, is positive in results. There is scarcely a subject that cannot be mathematically treated and the effects calculated or the results determined beforehand from the available theoretical and practical data. The carrying out into practice of a crude idea as is being generally done is, I hold, nothing but a waste of energy, money and time.

My early affliction had, however, another compensation. The incessant mental exertion developed my powers of observation and enabled me to discover a truth of great importance. I had noted that the appearance of images was always preceded by actual vision of scenes under peculiar and generally very exceptional conditions and I was impelled on each occasion to locate the original impulse. After a while this effort grew to be almost automatic and I gained great facility in connecting cause and effect. Soon I became aware, to my surprise, that every thought I conceived was suggested by an external impression. Not only this but all my actions were prompted in a similar way. In the course of time it became perfectly evident to me that I was merely an automaton endowed with power of movement, responding to the stimuli of the sense organs and thinking and acting accordingly. The practical result of this was the art of telautomatics which has been so far carried out only in an imperfect manner. Its latent possibilities will, however, be eventually shown. I have been since years planning self-controlled automata and believe that mechanisms can be produced which will act as if possessed of reason, to a limited degree, and will create a revolution in many commercial and industrial departments.

I was about 12 years old when I first succeeded in banishing an image from my vision by wilful effort, but I never had any control over the flashes of light to which I have referred. They were, perhaps, my strangest experience and inexplicable. They usually occurred when I found myself in a dangerous or distressing situation, or when I was greatly exhilarated. In some instances I have seen all the air around me filled with tongues of living flame. Their intensity, instead of diminishing, increased with time and seemingly attained a maximum when I was about 25 years old. While in Paris, in 1883, a prominent French manufacturer sent me an invitation to a shooting expedition which I accepted. I had been long confined to the factory and the fresh air had a wonderfully invigorating effect on me. On my return to the city that night I felt a positive sensation that my brain had caught fire. I saw a light as though a small sun was located in it and I past the whole night applying cold compressions to my tortured head. Finally the flashes diminished in frequency and force but it took more than 3 weeks before they wholly subsided. When a second invitation was extended to me my answer was an emphatic NO!

These luminous phenomena still manifest themselves from time to time, as when a new idea opening up possibilities strikes me, but they are no longer exciting, being of relatively small intensity. When I close my eyes I invariably observe first, a background of very dark and uniform blue, not unlike the sky on a clear but starless night. In a few seconds this field becomes animated with innumerable scintillating flakes of green, arranged in several layers and advancing towards me. Then there appears, to the right, a beautiful pattern of two systems of parallel and closely spaced lines, at right angles to one another, in all sorts of colors with yellow-green and gold predominating. Immediately thereafter the lines grow brighter and the whole is thickly sprinkled with dots of twinkling light. This picture moves slowly across the field of vision and in about 10 seconds vanishes to the left, leaving behind a ground of rather unpleasant and inert grey which quickly gives way to a billowy sea of clouds, seemingly trying to mould themselves in living shapes. It is curious that I cannot project a form into this grey until the second phase is reached. Every time, before falling asleep, images of persons or objects flit before my view. When I see them I know that I am about to lose consciousness. If they are absent and refuse to come it means a sleepless night.

To what an extent imagination played a part in my early life I may illustrate by another odd experience. Like most children I was fond of jumping and developed an intense desire to support myself in the air. Occasionally a strong wind richly charged with oxygen blew from the mountains rendering my body as light as cork and then I would leap and float in space for a long time. It was a delightful sensation and my disappointment was keen when later I undeceived myself.

During that period I contracted many strange likes, dislikes and habits, some of which I can trace to external impressions while others are unaccountable. I had a violent aversion against the earrings of women but other ornaments, as bracelets, pleased me more or less according to design. The sight of a pearl would almost give me a fit but I was fascinated with the glitter of crystals or objects with sharp edges and plane surfaces. I would not touch the hair of other people except, perhaps, at the point of a revolver. I would get a fever by looking at a peach and if a piece of camphor was anywhere in the house it caused me the keenest discomfort. Even now I am not insensible to some of these upsetting impulses. When I drop little squares of paper in a dish filled with liquid, I always sense a peculiar and awful taste in my mouth. I counted the steps in my walks and calculated the cubical contents of soup plates, coffee cups and pieces of food,—otherwise my meal was unenjoyable. All repeated acts or operations I performed had to be divisible by three and if I mist I felt impelled to do it all over again, even if it took hours.

Up to the age of 8 years, my character was weak and vacillating. I had neither courage or strength to form a firm resolve. My feelings came in waves and surges and vibrated unceasingly between extremes. My wishes were of consuming force and like the heads of the hydra, they multiplied. I was oppressed by thoughts of pain in life and death and religious fear. I was swayed by superstitious belief and lived in constant dread of the spirit of evil, of ghosts and ogres and other unholy monsters of the dark. Then, all at once, there came a tremendous change which altered the course of my whole existence.

Of all things I liked books the best. My father had a large library and whenever I could manage I tried to satisfy my passion for reading. He did not permit it and would fly into a rage when he caught me in the act. He hid the candles when he found that I was reading in secret. He did not want me to spoil my eyes. But I obtained tallow, made the wicking and cast the sticks into tin forms, and every night I would bush the keyhole and the cracks and read, often till dawn, when all others slept and my mother started on her arduous daily task. On one occasion I came across a novel entitled “Abafi” (the Son of Aba), a Serbian translation of a well known Hungarian writer, Josika. This work somehow awakened my dormant powers of will and I began to practice self-control. At first my resolutions faded like snow in April, but in a little while I conquered my weakness and felt a pleasure I never knew before—that of doing as I willed. In the course of time this vigorous mental exercise became second nature. At the outset my wishes had to be subdued but gradually desire and will grew to be identical. After years of such discipline I gained so complete a mastery over myself that I toyed with passions which have meant destruction to some of the strongest men. At a certain age I contracted a mania for gambling which greatly worried my parents. To sit down to a game of cards was for me the quintessence of pleasure. My father led an exemplary life and could not excuse the senseless waste of time and money in which I indulged. I had a strong resolve but my philosophy was bad. I would say to him, “I can stop whenever I please but is it worth while to give up that which I would purchase with the joys of Paradise?” On frequent occasions he gave vent to his anger and contempt but my mother was different. She understood the character of men and knew that one's salvation could only be brought about through his own efforts. One afternoon, I remember, when I had lost all my money and was craving for a game, she came to me with a roll of bills and said, “Go and enjoy yourself. The sooner you lose all we possess the better it will be. I know that you will get over it.” She was right. I conquered my passion then and there and only regretted that it had not been a hundred times as strong. I not only vanquished but tore it from my heart so as not to leave even a trace of desire. Ever since that time I have been as indifferent to any form of gambling as to picking teeth.

During another period I smoked excessively, threatening to ruin my health. Then my will asserted itself and I not only stopped but destroyed all inclination. Long ago I suffered from heart trouble until I discovered that it was due to the innocent cup of coffee I consumed every morning. I discontinued at once, although I confess it was not an easy task. In this way I checked and bridled other habits and passions and have not only preserved my life but derived an immense amount of satisfaction from what most men would consider privation and sacrifice.

After finishing the studies at the Polytechnic Institute and University I had a complete nervous breakdown and while the malady lasted I observed many phenomena strange and unbelievable.





Chapter 2　My First Efforts in Inventions


I shall dwell briefly on these extraordinary experiences, on account of their possible interest to students of psychology and physiology and also because this period of agony was of the greatest consequence on my mental development and subsequent labors. But it is indispensable to first relate the circumstances and conditions which preceded them and in which might be found their partial explanation.

From childhood I was compelled to concentrate attention upon myself. This caused me much suffering but, to my present view, it was a blessing in disguise for it has taught me to appreciate the inestimable value of introspection in the preservation of life, as well as a means of achievement. The pressure of occupation and the incessant stream of impressions pouring into our consciousness through all the gateways of knowledge make modern existence hazardous in many ways. Most persons are so absorbed in the contemplation of the outside world that they are wholly oblivious to what is passing on within themselves. The premature death of millions is primarily traceable to this cause. Even among those who exercise care it is a common mistake to avoid imaginary, and ignore the real dangers. And what is true of an individual also applies, more or less, to a people as a whole. Witness, in illustration, the prohibition movement. A drastic, if not unconstitutional, measure is now being put through in this country to prevent the consumption of alcohol and yet it is a positive fact that coffee, tea, tobacco, chewing gum and other stimulants, which are freely indulged in even at the tender age, are vastly more injurious to the national body, judging from the number of those who succumb. So, for instance, during my student years I gathered from the published necrologues in Vienna, the home of coffee drinkers, that deaths from heart trouble sometimes reached 67％ of the total. Similar observations might probably be made in cities where the consumption of tea is excessive. These delicious beverages super-excite and gradually exhaust the fine fibers of the brain. They also interfere seriously with arterial circulation and should be enjoyed all the more sparingly as their deleterious effects are slow and imperceptible. Tobacco, on the other hand, is conducive to easy and pleasant thinking and detracts from the intensity and concentration necessary to all original and vigorous effort of the intellect. Chewing gum is helpful for a short while but soon drains the glandular system and inflicts irreparable damage, not to speak of the revulsion it creates. Alcohol in small quantities is an excellent tonic, but is toxic in its action when absorbed in larger amounts, quite immaterial as to whether it is taken in as whiskey or produced in the stomach from sugar. But it should not be overlooked that all these are great eliminators assisting Nature, as they do, in upholding her stern but just law of the survival of the fittest. Eager reformers should also be mindful of the eternal perversity of mankind which makes the indifferent “laissez-faire” by far preferable to enforced restraint. The truth about this is that we need stimulants to do our best work under present living conditions, and that we must exercise moderation and control our appetites and inclinations in every direction. That is what I have been doing for many years, in this way maintaining myself young in body and mind. Abstinence was not always to my liking but I find ample reward in the agreeable experiences I am now making. Just in the hope of converting some to my precepts and convictions I will recall one or two.

A short time ago I was returning to my hotel. It was a bitter cold night, the ground slippery, and no taxi to be had. Half a block behind me followed another man, evidently as anxious as myself to get under cover. Suddenly my legs went up in the air. In the same instant there was a flash in my brain, the nerves responded, the muscles contracted, I swung through 180 degrees and landed on my hands. I resumed my walk as though nothing had happened when the stranger caught up with me. “How old are you?” he asked, surveying me critically. “Oh, about 59,” I replied. “What of it?” “Well,” said he, “I have seen a cat do this but never a man.” About a month since I wanted to order new eyeglasses and went to an oculist who put me through the usual tests. He looked at me incredulously as I read off with ease the smallest print at considerable distance. But when I told him that I was past sixty he gasped in astonishment. Friends of mine often remark that my suits fit me like gloves but they do not know that all my clothing is made to measurements which were taken nearly 35 years ago and never changed. During this same period my weight has not varied one pound.

In this connection I may tell a funny story. One evening, in the winter of 1885, Mr. Edison, Edward H. Johnson, the President of the Edison Illuminating Company, Mr. Batchellor, Manager of the works, and myself entered a little place opposite 65 Fifth Avenue where the offices of the company were located. Someone suggested guessing weights and I was induced to step on a scale. Edison felt me all over and said: “Tesla weighs 152 lbs. to an ounce,” and he guest it exactly. Stripped I weighed 142 lbs. and that is still my weight. I whispered to Mr. Johnson, “How is it possible that Edison could guess my weight so closely?” “Well,” he said, lowering his voice. “I will tell you, confidentially, but you must not say anything. He was employed for a long time in a Chicago slaughter-house where he weighed thousands of hogs every day! That's why.” My friend, the Honorable Chauncey M. Depew, tells of an Englishman on whom he sprung one of his original anecdotes and who listened with a puzzled expression but—a year later—laughed out loud. I will frankly confess it took me longer than that to appreciate Johnson's joke.

Now, my well being is simply the result of a careful and measured mode of living and perhaps the most astonishing thing is that three times in my youth I was rendered by illness a hopeless physical wreck and given up by physicians. More than this, through ignorance and lightheartedness, I got into all sorts of difficulties, dangers and scrapes from which I extricated myself as by enchantment. I was almost drowned a dozen times; was nearly boiled alive and just mist being cremated. I was entombed, lost and frozen. I had hair-breadth escapes from mad dogs, hogs, and other wild animals. I past through dreadful diseases and met with all kinds of odd mishaps and that I am hale and hearty today seems like a miracle. But as I recall these incidents to my mind I feel convinced that my preservation was not altogether accidental.

An inventor's endeavor is essentially life-saving. Whether he harnesses forces, improves devices, or provides new comforts and conveniences, he is adding to the safety of our existence. He is also better qualified than the average individual to protect himself in peril, for he is observant and resourceful. If I had no other evidence that I was, in a measure, possessed of such qualities I would find it in these personal experiences. The reader will be able to judge for himself if I mention one or two instances. On one occasion, when about 14 years old, I wanted to scare some friends who were bathing with me. My plan was to dive under a long floating structure and slip out quietly at the other end. Swimming and diving came to me as naturally as to a duck and I was confident that I could perform the feat. Accordingly I plunged into the water and, when out of view, turned around and proceeded rapidly towards the opposite side. Thinking that I was safely beyond the structure, I rose to the surface but to my dismay struck a beam. Of course, I quickly dived and forged ahead with rapid strokes until my breath was beginning to give out. Rising for the second time, my head came again in contact with a beam. Now I was becoming desperate. However, summoning all my energy, I made a third frantic attempt but the result was the same. The torture of suppressed breathing was getting unendurable, my brain was reeling and I felt myself sinking. At that moment, when my situation seemed absolutely hopeless, I experienced one of those flashes of light and the structure above me appeared before my vision. I either discerned or guessed that there was a little space between the surface of the water and the boards resting on the beams and, with consciousness nearly gone, I floated up, pressed my mouth close to the planks and managed to inhale a little air, unfortunately mingled with a spray of water which nearly choked me. Several times I repeated this procedure as in a dream until my heart, which was racing at a terrible rate, quieted down and I gained composure. After that I made a number of unsuccessful dives, having completely lost the sense of direction, but finally succeeded in getting out of the trap when my friends had already given me up and were fishing for my body.

That bathing season was spoiled for me through recklessness but I soon forgot the lesson and only 2 years later I fell into a worse predicament. There was a large flour mill with a dam across the river near the city where I was studying at that time. As a rule the height of the water was only two or three inches above the dam and to swim out to it was a sport not very dangerous in which I often indulged. One day I went alone to the river to enjoy myself as usual. When I was a short distance from the masonry, however, I was horrified to observe that the water had risen and was carrying me along swiftly. I tried to get away but it was too late. Luckily, though, I saved myself from being swept over by taking hold of the wall with both hands. The pressure against my chest was great and I was barely able to keep my head above the surface. Not a soul was in sight and my voice was lost in the roar of the fall. Slowly and gradually I became exhausted and unable to withstand the strain longer. Just as I was about to let go, to be dashed against the rocks below, I saw in a flash of light a familiar diagram illustrating the hydraulic principle that the pressure of a fluid in motion is proportionate to the area exposed, and automatically I turned on my left side. As if by magic the pressure was reduced and I found it comparatively easy in that position to resist the force of the stream. But the danger still confronted me. I knew that sooner or later I would be carried down, as it was not possible for any help to reach me in time, even if I attracted attention. I am ambidextrous now but then I was left-handed and had comparatively little strength in my right arm. For this reason I did not dare to turn on the other side to rest and nothing remained but to slowly push my body along the dam. I had to get away from the mill towards which my face was turned as the current there was much swifter and deeper. It was a long and painful ordeal and I came near to failing at its very end for I was confronted with a depression in the masonry. I managed to get over with the last ounce of my force and fell in a swoon when I reached the bank, where I was found. I had torn virtually all the skin from my left side and it took several weeks before the fever subsided and I was well. These are only two of many instances but they may be sufficient to show that had it not been for the inventor's instinct I would not have lived to tell this tale.

Interested people have often asked me how and when I began to invent. This I can only answer from my present recollection in the light of which the first attempt I recall was rather ambitious for it involved the invention of an apparatus and a method. In the former I was anticipated but the latter was original. It happened in this way. One of my playmates had come into the possession of a hook and fishing-tackle which created quite an excitement in the village, and the next morning all started out to catch frogs. I was left alone and deserted owing to a quarrel with this boy. I had never seen a real hook and pictured it as something wonderful, endowed with peculiar qualities, and was despairing not to be one of the party. Urged by necessity, I somehow got hold of a piece of soft iron wire, hammered the end to a sharp point between two stones, bent it into shape, and fastened it to a strong string. I then cut a rod, gathered some bait, and went down to the brook where there were frogs in abundance. But I could not catch any and was almost discouraged when it occurred to me to dangle the empty hook in front of a frog sitting on a stump. At first he collapsed but by and by his eyes bulged out and became bloodshot, he swelled to twice his normal size and made a vicious snap at the hook. Immediately I pulled him up. I tried the same thing again and again and the method proved infallible. When my comrades, who in spite of their fine outfit had caught nothing, came to me they were green with envy. For a long time I kept my secret and enjoyed the monopoly but finally yielded to the spirit of Christmas. Every boy could then do the same and the following summer brought disaster to the frogs.

In my next attempt I seem to have acted under the first in-stinctive impulse which later dominated me—to harness the energies of nature to the service of man. I did this through the medium of May-bugs—or June-bugs as they are called in America—which were a veritable pest in that country and sometimes broke the branches of trees by the sheer weight of their bodies. The bushes were black with them. I would attach as many as four of them to a cross-plece, rotably arranged on a thin spindle, and transmit the motion of the same to a large disc and so derive considerable “power.” These creatures were remarkably efficient, for once they were started they had no sense to stop and continued whirling for hours and hours and the hotter it was the harder they worked. All went well until a strange boy came to the place. He was the son of a retired officer in the Austrian Army. That urchin ate May-bugs alive and enjoyed them as though they were the finest blue-point oysters. That disgusting sight terminated my endeavors in this promising field and I have never since been able to touch a May-bug or any other insect for that matter.

After that, I believe, I undertook to take apart and assemble the clocks of my grandfather. In the former operation I was always successful but often failed in the latter. So it came that he brought my work to a sudden halt in a manner not too delicate and it took 30 years before I tackled another clockwork again. Shortly thereafter I went into the manufacture of a kind of pop-gun which comprised a hollow tube, a piston, and two plugs of hemp. When firing the gun, the piston was pressed against the stomach and the tube was pushed back quickly with both hands. The air between the plugs was compressed and raised to high temperature and one of them was expelled with a loud report. The art consisted in selecting a tube of the proper taper from the hollow stalks. I did very well with that gun but my activities interfered with the window panes in our house and met with painful discouragement. If I remember rightly, I then took to carving swords from pieces of furniture which I could conveniently obtain. At that time I was under the sway of the Serbian national poetry and full of admiration for the feats of the heroes. I used to spend hours in mowing down my enemies in the form of corn-stalks which ruined the crops and netted me several spankings from my mother. Moreover these were not of the formal kind but the genuine article.

I had all this and more behind me before I was 6 years old and had past through 1 year of elementary school in the village of Smiljan where I was born. At this juncture we moved to the little city of Gospic nearby. This change of residence was like a calamity to me. It almost broke my heart to part from our pigeons, chickens and sheep, and our magnificent flock of geese which used to rise to the clouds in the morning and return from the feeding grounds at sundown in battle formation, so perfect that it would have put a squadron of the best aviators of the present day to shame. In our new house I was but a prisoner, watching the strange people I saw through the window blinds. My bashfulness was such that I would rather have faced a roaring lion than one of the city dudes who strolled about. But my hardest trial came on Sunday when I had to dress up and attend the service. There I meet with an accident, the mere thought of which made my blood curdle like sour milk for years afterwards. It was my second adventure in a church. Not long before I was entombed for a night in an old chapel on an inaccessible mountain which was visited only once a year. It was an awful experience, but this one was worse. There was a wealthy lady in town, a good but pompous woman, who used to come to the church gorgeously painted up and attired with an enormous train and attendants. One Sunday I had just finished ringing the bell in the belfry and rushed downstairs when this grand dame was sweeping out and I jumped on her train. It tore off with a ripping noise which sounded like a salvo of musketry fired by raw recruits. My father was livid with rage. He gave me a gentle slap on the cheek, the only corporal punishment he ever administered to me but I almost feel it now. The embarrassment and confusion that followed are indescribable. I was practically ostracised until something else happened which redeemed me in the estimation of the community.

An enterprising young merchant had organized a fire department. A new fire engine was purchased, uniforms provided and the men drilled for service and parade. The engine was, in reality, a pump to be worked by 16 men and was beautifully painted red and black. One afternoon the official trial was prepared for and the machine was transported to the river. The entire population turned out to witness the great spectacle. When all the speeches and ceremonies were concluded, the command was given to pump, but not a drop of water came from the nozzle. The professors and experts tried in vain to locate the trouble. The fizzle was complete when I arrived at the scene. My knowledge of the mechanism was nil and I knew next to nothing of air pressure, but instinctively I felt for the suction hose in the water and found that it had collapsed. When I waded in the river and opened it up the water rushed forth and not a few Sunday clothes were spoiled. Archimedes running naked through the streets of Syracuse and shouting Eureka at the top of his voice did not make a greater impression than myself. I was carried on the shoulders and was the hero of the day.

Upon settling in the city I began a 4 year course in the so-called Normal School preparatory to my studies at the College or Real-Gymnasium. During this period my boyish efforts and exploits, as well as troubles, continued. Among other things I attained the unique distinction of champion crow catcher in the country. My method of procedure was extremely simple. I would go in the forest, hide in the bushes, and imitate the call of the bird. Usually I would get several answers and in a short while a crow would flutter down into the shrubbery near me. After that all I needed to do was to throw a piece of cardboard to distract its attention, jump up and grab it before it could extricate itself from the undergrowth. In this way I would capture as many as I desired. But on one occasion something occurred which made me respect them. I had caught a fine pair of birds and was returning home with a friend. When we left the forest, thousands of crows had gathered making a frightful racket. In a few minutes they rose in pursuit and soon enveloped us. The fun lasted until all of a sudden I received a blow on the back of my head which knocked me down. Then they attacked me viciously. I was compelled to release the two birds and was glad to join my friend who had taken refuge in a cave.

In the schoolroom there were a few mechanical models which interested me and turned my attention to water turbines. I constructed many of these and found great pleasure in operating them. How extraordinary was my life an incident may illustrate. My uncle had no use for this kind of pastime and more than once rebuked me. I was fascinated by a description of Niagara Falls I had perused, and pictured in my imagination a big wheel run by the Falls. I told my uncle that I would go to America and carry out this scheme. Thirty years later I saw my ideas carried out at Niagara and marveled at the unfathomable mystery of the mind.

I made all kinds of other contrivances and contraptions but among these the arbalist I produced were the best. My arrows, when shot, disappeared from sight and at close range traversed a plank of pine 1 inch thick. through the continuous tightening of the bows I developed skin on my stomach very much like that of a crocodile and I am often wondering whether it is due to this exercise that I am able even now to digest cobble-stones! Nor can I pass in silence my performances with the sling which would have enabled me to give a stunning exhibit at the Hippodrome. And now I will tell of one of my feats with this antique implement of war which will strain to the utmost the credulity of the reader. I was practicing while walking with my uncle along the river. The sun was setting, the trout were playful and from time to time one would shoot up into the air, its glistening body sharply defined against a projecting rock beyond. Of course any boy might have hit a fish under these propitious conditions but I undertook a much more difficult task and I foretold to my uncle, to the minutest detail, what I intended doing. I was to hurl a stone to meet the fish, press its body against the rock, and cut it in two. It was no sooner said than done. My uncle looked at me almost scared out of his wits and exclaimed “Vade retro Satanas!” and it was a few days before he spoke to me again. Other records, how ever great, will be eclipsed but I feel that I could peacefully rest on my laurels for a thousand years.





Chapter 3　My Later Endeavors: The Discovery of the Rotating Magnetic Field


At the age of 10 I entered the Real Gymnasium which was a new and fairly well equipped institution. In the department of physics were various models of classical scientific apparatus, electrical and mechanical. The demonstrations and experiments performed from time to time by the instructors fascinated me and were undoubtedly a powerful incentive to invention. I was also passionately fond of mathematical studies and often won the professor's praise for rapid calculation. This was due to my acquired facility of visualizing the figures and performing the operations, not in the usual intuitive manner, but as in actual life. Up to a certain degree of complexity it was absolutely the same to me whether I wrote the symbols on the board or conjured them before my mental vision. But freehand drawing, to which many hours of the course were devoted, was an annoyance I could not endure. This was rather remarkable as most of the members of the family excelled in it. Perhaps my aversion was simply due to the predilection I found in undisturbed thought. Had it not been for a few exceptionally stupid boys, who could not do anything at all, my record would have been the worst. It was a serious handicap as under the then existing educational regime, drawing being obligatory, this deficiency threatened to spoil my whole career and my father had considerable trouble in railroading me from one class to another.

In the second year at that institution I became obsessed with the idea of producing continuous motion through steady air pressure. The pump incident, of which I have told, had set afire my youthful imagination and imprest me with the boundless abilities of a vacuum. I grew frantic in my desire to harness this inexhaustible energy but for a long time I was groping in the dark. Finally, however, my endeavors crystallized in an invention which was to enable me to achieve what no other mortal ever attempted. Imagine a cylinder freely rotatable on two bearings and partly surrounded by a rectangular trough which fits it perfectly. The open side of the trough is closed by a partition so that the cylindrical segment within the enclosure divides the latter into two compartments entirely separated from each other by air-tight sliding joints. One of these compartments being sealed and once for all exhausted, the other remaining open, a perpetual rotation of the cylinder would result, at least, I thought so. A wooden model was constructed and fitted with infinite care and when I applied the pump on one side and actually observed that there was a tendency to turning, I was delirious with joy. Mechanical flight was the one thing I wanted to accomplish although still under the discouraging recollection of a bad fall I sustained by jumping with an umbrella from the top of a building. Every day I used to transport myself through the air to distant regions but could not understand just how I managed to do it. Now I had something concrete—a flying machine with nothing more than a rotating shaft, flapping wings, and—a vacuum of unlimited power! From that time on I made my daily aërial excursions in a vehicle of comfort and luxury as might have befitted King Solomon. It took years before I understood that the atmospheric pressure acted at right angles to the surface of the cylinder and that the slight rotary effort I observed was due to a leak. Though this knowledge came gradually it gave me a painful shock. I had hardly completed my course at the Real Gymnasium when I was prostrated with a dangerous illness or rather, a score of them, and my condition became so desperate that I was given up by physicians. During this period I was permitted to read constantly, obtaining books from the Public Library which had been neglected and entrusted to me for classification of the works and preparation of the catalogues. One day I was handed a few volumes of new literature unlike anything I had ever read before and so captivating as to make me utterly forget my hopeless state. They were the earlier works of Mark Twain and to them might have been due the miraculous recovery which followed. Twenty-five years later, when I met Mr. Clemens and we formed a friendship between us, I told him of the experience and was amazed to see that great man of laughter burst into tears.

My studies were continued at the higher Real Gymnasium in Carlstadt, Croatia, where one of my aunts resided. She was a distinguished lady, the wife of a Colonel who was an old war-horse having participated in many battles. I never can forget the 3 years I passed at their home. No fortress in time of war was under a more rigid discipline. I was fed like a canary bird. All the meals were of the highest quality and deliciously prepared but short in quantity by a thousand percent. The slices of ham cut by my aunt were like tissue paper. When the Colonel would put something substantial on my plate she would snatch it away and say excitedly to him: “Be careful, Niko is very delicate.” I had a voracious appetite and suffered like Tantalus. But I lived in an atmosphere of refinement and artistic taste quite unusual for those times and conditions. The land was low and marshy and malaria fever never left me while there despite of the enormous amounts of quinine I consumed. Occasionally the river would rise and drive an army of rats into the buildings, devouring everything even to the bundles of the fierce paprika. These pests were to me a welcome diversion. I thinned their ranks by all sorts of means, which won me the unenviable distinction of rat-catcher in the community. At last, however, my course was completed, the misery ended, and I obtained the certificate of maturity which brought me to the cross-roads.

During all those years my parents never wavered in their resolve to make me embrace the clergy, the mere thought of which filled me with dread. I had become intensely interested in electricity under the stimulating influence of my Professor of Physics, who was an ingenious man and often demonstrated the principles by apparatus of his own invention. Among these I recall a device in the shape of a freely rotatable bulb, with tinfoil coatings, which was made to spin rapidly when connected to a static machine. It is impossible for me to convey an adequate idea of the intensity of feeling I experienced in witnessing his exhibitions of these mysterious phenomena. Every impression produced a thousand echoes in my mind. I wanted to know more of this wonderful force; I longed for experiment and investigation and resigned myself to the inevitable with aching heart.

Just as I was making ready for the long journey home I received word that my father wished me to go on a shooting expedition. It was a strange request as he had been always strenuously opposed to this kind of sport. But a few days later I learned that the cholera was raging in that district and, taking advantage of an opportunity, I returned to Gospic in disregard of my parents' wishes. It is incredible how absolutely ignorant people were as to the causes of this scourge which visited the country in intervals of from 15 to 20 years. They thought that the deadly agents were transmitted through the air and filled it with pungent odors and smoke. In the meantime they drank the infected water and died in heaps. I contracted the awful disease on the very day of my arrival and although surviving the crisis, I was confined to bed for 9 months with scarcely any ability to move. My energy was completely exhausted and for the second time I found myself at death's door. In one of the sinking spells which was thought to be the last, my father rushed into the room. I still see his pallid face as he tried to cheer me in tones belying his assurance. “Perhaps,” I said, “I may get well if you will let me study engineering.” “You will go to the best technical institution in the world,” he solemnly replied, and I knew that he meant it. A heavy weight was lifted from my mind but the relief would have come too late had it not been for a marvelous cure brought about through a bitter decoction of a peculiar bean. I came to life like another Lazarus to the utter amazement of everybody. My father insisted that I spend a year in healthful physical outdoor exercises to which I reluctantly consented. For most of this term I roamed in the mountains, loaded with a hunter's outfit and a bundle of books, and this contact with nature made me stronger in body as well as in mind. I thought and planned, and conceived many ideas almost as a rule delusive. The vision was clear enough but the knowledge of principles was very limited. In one of my inventions I proposed to convey letters and packages across the seas, through a submarine tube, in spherical containers of sufficient strength to resist the hydraulic pressure. The pumping plant, intended to force the water through the tube, was accurately figured and designed and all other particulars carefully worked out. Only one trifling detail, of no consequence, was lightly dismissed. I assumed an arbitrary velocity of the water and, what is more, took pleasure in making it high, thus arriving at a stupendous performance supported by faultless calculations. Subsequent reflections, however, on the resistance of pipes to fluid flow determined me to make this invention public property.

Another one of my projects was to construct a ring around the equator which would, of course, float freely and could be arrested in its spinning motion by reactionary forces, thus enabling travel at a rate of about one thousand miles an hour, impracticable by rail. The reader will smile. The plan was difficult of execution, I will admit, but not nearly so bad as that of a well-known New York professor, who wanted to pump the air from the torrid to the temperate zones, entirely forgetful of the fact that the Lord had provided a gigantic machine for this very purpose.

Still another scheme, far more important and attractive, was to derive power from the rotational energy of terrestrial bodies. I had discovered that objects on the earth's surface, owing to the diurnal rotation of the globe, are carried by the same alternately in and against the direction of translatory movement. From this results a great change in momentum which could be utilized in the simplest imaginable manner to furnish motive effort in any habitable region of the world. I cannot find words to describe my disappointment when later I realized that I was in the predicament of Archimedes, who vainly sought for a fixed point in the universe.

At the termination of my vacation I was sent to the Polytechnic School in Gratz, Styria, which my father had chosen as one of the oldest and best reputed institutions. That was the moment I had eagerly awaited and I began my studies under good auspices and firmly resolved to succeed. My previous training was above the average, due to my father's teaching and opportunities afforded. I had acquired the knowledge of a number of languages and waded through the books of several libraries, picking up information more or less useful. Then again, for the first time, I could choose my subjects as I liked, and free-hand drawing was to bother me no more. I had made up my mind to give my parents a surprise, and during the whole first year I regularly started my work at three o'clock in the morning and continued until eleven at night, no Sundays or holidays excepted. As most of my fellow-students took things easily, naturally enough I eclipsed all records. In the course of that year I past through nine exams and the professors thought I deserved more than the highest qualifications. Armed with their flattering certificates, I went home for a short rest, expecting a triumph, and was mortified when my father made light of these hard won honors. That almost killed my ambition; but later, after he had died, I was pained to find a package of letters which the professors had written him to the effect that unless he took me away from the Institution I would be killed through overwork. Thereafter I devoted myself chiefly to physics, mechanics and mathematical studies, spending the hours of leisure in the libraries. I had a veritable mania for finishing whatever I began, which often got me into difficulties. On one occasion I started to read the works of Voltaire when I learned, to my dismay, that there were close on one hundred large volumes in small print which that monster had written while drinking seventy-two cups of black coffee per diem. It had to be done, but when I laid aside the last book I was very glad, and said, “Never more!”

My first year's showing had won me the appreciation and friendship of several professors. Among these were Prof. Rogner, who was teaching arithmetical subjects and geometry; Prof. Poeschl, who held the chair of theoretical and experimental physics, and Dr. Allé, who taught integral calculus and specialized in differential equations. This scientist was the most brilliant lecturer to whom I ever listened. He took a special interest in my progress and would frequently remain for an hour or two in the lecture room, giving me problems to solve, in which I delighted. To him I explained a flying machine I had conceived, not an illusionary invention, but one based on sound, scientific principles, which has become realizable through my turbine and will soon be given to the world. Both Professors Rogner and Poeschl were curious men. The former had peculiar ways of expressing himself and whenever he did so there was a riot, followed by a long and embarrassing pause. Prof. Poeschl was a methodical and thoroughly grounded German. He had enormous feet and hands like the paws of a bear, but all of his experiments were skillfully performed with clock-like precision and without a miss.

It was in the second year of my studies that we received a Gramme dynamo from Paris, having the horseshoe form of a laminated field magnet, and a wire-wound armature with a commutator. It was connected up and various effects of the currents were shown. While Prof. Poeschl was making demonstrations, running the machine as a motor, the brushes gave trouble, sparking badly, and I observed that it might be possible to operate a motor without these appliances. But he declared that it could not be done and did me the honor of delivering a lecture on the subject, at the conclusion of which he remarked: “Mr. Tesla may accomplish great things, but he certainly never will do this. It would be equivalent to converting a steadily pulling force, like that of gravity, into a rotary effort. It is a perpetual motion scheme, an impossible idea.” But instinct is something which transcends knowledge. We have, undoubtedly, certain finer fibers that enable us to perceive truths when logical deduction, or any other willful effort of the brain, is futile. For a time I wavered, imprest by the professor's authority, but soon became convinced I was right and undertook the task with all the fire and boundless confidence of youth.

I started by first picturing in my mind a direct-current machine, running it and following the changing flow of the currents in the armature. Then I would imagine an alternator and investigate the processes taking place in a similar manner. Next I would visualize systems comprising motors and generators and operate them in various ways. The images I saw were to me perfectly real and tangible. All my remaining term in Gratz was passed in intense but fruitless efforts of this kind, and I almost came to the conclusion that the problem was insolvable. In 1880 I went to Prague, Bohemia, carrying out my father's wish to complete my education at the University there. It was in that city that I made a decided advance, which consisted in detaching the commutator from the machine and studying the phenomena in this new aspect, but still without result. In the year following there was a sudden change in my views of life. I realized that my parents had been making too great sacrifices on my account and resolved to relieve them of the burden. The wave of the American telephone had just reached the European continent and the system was to be installed in Budapest, Hungary. It appeared an ideal opportunity, all the more as a friend of our family was at the head of the enterprise. It was here that I suffered the complete breakdown of the nerves to which I have referred. What I experienced during the period of that illness surpasses all belief. My sight and hearing were always extraordinary. I could clearly discern objects in the distance when others saw no trace of them. Several times in my boyhood I saved the houses of our neighbors from fire by hearing the faint crackling sounds which did not disturb their sleep, and calling for help.

In 1899, when I was past 40 and carrying on my experiments in Colorado, I could hear very distinctly thunderclaps at a distance of 550 miles. The limit of audition for my young assistants was scarcely more than 150 miles. My ear was thus over thirteen times more sensitive. Yet at that time I was, so to speak, stone deaf in comparison with the acuteness of my hearing while under the nervous strain. In Budapest I could hear the ticking of a watch with three rooms between me and the time-piece. A fly alighting on a table in the room would cause a dull thud in my ear. A carriage passing at a distance of a few miles fairly shook my whole body. The whistle of a locomotive 20 or 30 miles away made the bench or chair on which I sat vibrate so strongly that the pain was unbearable. The ground under my feet trembled continuously. I had to support my bed on rubber cushions to get any rest at all. The roaring noises from near and far often produced the effect of spoken words which would have frightened me had I not been able to resolve them into their accidental components. The sun's rays, when periodically intercepted, would cause blows of such force on my brain that they would stun me. I had to summon all my will power to pass under a bridge or other structure as I experienced a crushing pressure on the skull. In the dark I had the sense of a bat and could detect the presence of an object at a distance of 12 feet by a peculiar creepy sensation on the forehead. My pulse varied from a few to 260 beats and all the tissues of the body quivered with twitchings and tremors which was perhaps the hardest to bear. A renowned physician who gave me daily large doses of Bromide of Potassium pronounced my malady unique and incurable. It is my eternal regret that I was not under the observation of experts in physiology and psychology at that time. I clung desperately to life, but never expected to recover. Can anyone believe that so hopeless a physical wreck could ever be transformed into a man of astonishing strength and tenacity, able to work 38 years almost without a day's interruption, and find himself still strong and fresh in body and mind? Such is my case. A powerful desire to live and to continue the work, and the assistance of a devoted friend and athlete accomplished the wonder. My health returned and with it the vigor of mind. In attacking the problem again I almost regretted that the struggle was soon to end. I had so much energy to spare. When I undertook the task it was not with a resolve such as men often make. With me it was a sacred vow, a question of life and death. I knew that I would perish if I failed. Now I felt that the battle was won. Back in the deep recesses of the brain was the solution, but I could not yet give it outward expression. One afternoon, which is ever present in my recollection, I was enjoying a walk with my friend in the City Park and reciting poetry. At that age I knew entire books by heart, word for word. One of these was Göethe's Faust. The sun was just setting and reminded me of the glorious passage:

Sie rückt und weicht, der Tag ist überlebt,

Dort eilt sie hin und fördert neues Leben.

Oh, dass kein Flügel mich vom Boden hebt

Ihr nach und immer nach zu streben!

Ein schöner Traum indessen sie entweicht,

Ach, zu des Geistes Flügeln wird so leicht

Kein körperlicher Flügel sich gesellen!

(The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;

It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;

Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil

Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!

A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.

Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid

Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.)

As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning and in an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand the diagrams shown 6 years later in my address before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and my companion understood them perfectly. The images I saw were wonderfully sharp and clear and had the solidity of metal and stone, so much so that I told him: “See my motor here; watch me reverse it.” I cannot begin to describe my emotions. Pygmalion seeing his statue come to life could not have been more deeply moved. A thousand secrets of nature which I might have stumbled upon accidentally I would have given for that one which I had wrested from her against all odds and at the peril of my existence.





Chapter 4　The Discovery of the Tesla Coil and Transformer


For a while I gave myself up entirely to the intense enjoyment of picturing machines and devising new forms. It was a mental state of happiness about as complete as I have ever known in life. Ideas came in an uninterrupted stream and the only difficulty I had was to hold them fast. The pieces of apparatus I conceived were to me absolutely real and tangible in every detail, even to the minute marks and signs of wear. I delighted in imagining the motors constantly running, for in this way they presented to mind's eye a more fascinating sight. When natural inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advances towards his goal in seven-league boots. In less than 2 months I evolved virtually all the types of motors and modifications of the system which are now identified with my name. It was, perhaps, providential that the necessities of existence commanded a temporary halt to this consuming activity of the mind. I came to Budapest prompted by a premature report concerning the telephone enterprise and, as irony of fate willed it, I had to accept a position as draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office of the Hungarian Government at a salary which I deem it my privilege not to disclose! Fortunately, I soon won the interest of the Inspector-in-Chief and was thereafter employed on calculations, designs and estimates in connection with new installations, until the Telephone Exchange was started, when I took charge of the same. The knowledge and practical experience I gained in the course of this work was most valuable and the employment gave me ample opportunities for the exercise of my inventive faculties. I made several improvements in the Central Station apparatus and perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier which was never patented or publicly described but would be creditable to me even today. In recognition of my efficient assistance the organizer of the undertaking, Mr. Puskas, upon disposing of his business in Budapest, offered me a position in Paris which I gladly accepted.

I never can forget the deep impression that magic city produced on my mind. For several days after my arrival I roamed through the streets in utter bewilderment of the new spectacle. The attractions were many and irresistible, but, alas, the income was spent as soon as received. When Mr. Puskas asked me how I was getting along in the new sphere, I described the situation accurately in the statement that “the last 29 days of the month are the toughest!” I led a rather strenuous life in what would now be termed “Rooseveltian fashion.” Every morning, regardless of weather, I would go from the Boulevard St. Marcel, where I resided, to a bathing house on the Seine, plunge into the water, loop the circuit twenty-seven times and then walk an hour to reach Ivry, where the Company's factory was located. There I would have a woodchopper's breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and then eagerly await the lunch hour, in the meanwhile cracking hard nuts for the Manager of the Works, Mr. Charles Batchellor, who was an intimate friend and assistant of Edison. Here I was thrown in contact with a few Americans who fairly fell in love with me because of my proficiency in—billiards. To these men I explained my invention and one of them, Mr. D. Cunningham, Foreman of the Mechanical Department, offered to form a stock company. The proposal seemed to me comical in the extreme. I did not have the faintest conception of what that meant except that it was an American way of doing things. Nothing came of it, however, and during the next few months I had to travel from one to another place in France and Germany to cure the ills of the power plants. On my return to Paris I submitted to one of the administrators of the Company, Mr. Rau, a plan for improving their dynamos and was given an opportunity. My success was complete and the delighted directors accorded me the privilege of developing automatic regulators which were much desired. Shortly after there was some trouble with the lighting plant which had been installed at the new railroad station in Strassburg, Alsace. The wiring was defective and on the occasion of the opening ceremonies a large part of a wall was blown out through a short-circuit right in the presence of old Emperor William I. The German Government refused to take the plant and the French Company was facing a serious loss. On account of my knowledge of the German language and past experience, I was entrusted with the difficult task of straightening out matters and early in 1883 I went to Strassburg on that mission.

Some of the incidents in that city have left an indelible record on my memory. By a curious coincidence, a number of men who subsequently achieved fame, lived there about that time. In later life I used to say, “There were bacteria of greatness in that old town. Others caught the disease but I escaped!” The practical work, correspondence, and conferences with officials kept me preoccupied day and night, but, as soon as I was able to manage I undertook the construction of a simple motor in a mechanical shop opposite the railroad station, having brought with me from Paris some material for that purpose. The consummation of the experiment was, however, delayed until the summer of that year when I finally had the satisfaction of seeing rotation effected by alternating currents of different phase, and without sliding contacts or commutator, as I had conceived a year before. It was an exquisite pleasure but not to compare with the delirium of joy following the first revelation.

Among my new friends was the former Mayor of the city, Mr. Bauzin, whom I had already in a measure acquainted with this and other inventions of mine and whose support I endeavored to enlist. He was sincerely devoted to me and put my project before several wealthy persons but, to my mortification, found no response. He wanted to help me in every possible way and the approach of the first of July, 1919, happens to remind me of a form of “assistance” I received from that charming man, which was not financial but none the less appreciated. In 1870, when the Germans invaded the country, Mr. Bauzin had buried a good sized allotment of St. Estèphe of 1801 and he came to the conclusion that he knew no worthier person than myself to consume that precious beverage. This, I may say, is one of the unforgettable incidents to which I have referred. My friend urged me to return to Paris as soon as possible and seek support there. This I was anxious to do but my work and negotiations were protracted owing to all sorts of petty obstacles I encountered so that at times the situation seemed hopeless.

Just to give an idea of German thoroughness and “efficiency,” I may mention here a rather funny experience. An incandescent lamp of 16 c.p. was to be placed in a hallway and upon selecting the proper location I ordered the monteur to run the wires. After working for a while he concluded that the engineer had to be consulted and this was done. The latter made several objections but ultimately agreed that the lamp should be placed 2 inches from the spot I had assigned, whereupon the work proceeded. Then the engineer became worried and told me that Inspector Averdeck should be notified. That important person called, investigated, debated, and decided that the lamp should be shifted back 2 inches, which was the place I had marked. It was not long, however, before Averdeck got cold feet himself and advised me that he had informed Ober-Inspector Hieronimus of the matter and that I should await his decision. It was several days before the Ober-Inspector was able to free himself of other pressing duties but at last he arrived and a 2 hour debate followed, when he decided to move the lamp 2 inches farther. My hopes that this was the final act were shattered when the Ober-Inspector returned and said to me: “Regierungsrath Funke is so particular that I would not dare to give an order for placing this lamp without his explicit approval.” Accordingly arrangements for a visit from that great man were made. We started cleaning up and polishing early in the morning. Everybody brushed up, I put on my gloves and when Funke came with his retinue he was ceremoniously received. After 2 hours of deliberation he suddenly exclaimed: “I must be going,” and pointing to a place on the ceiling, he ordered me to put the lamp there. It was the exact spot which I had originally chosen.

So it went day after day with variations, but I was determined to achieve at whatever cost and in the end my efforts were rewarded. By the spring of 1884 all the differences were adjusted, the plant formally accepted, and I returned to Paris with pleasing anticipations. One of the administrators had promised me a liberal compensation in case I succeeded, as well as a fair consideration of the improvements I had made in their dynamos and I hoped to realize a substantial sum. There were three administrators whom I shall designate as A, B and C for convenience. When I called on A he told me that B had the say. This gentleman thought that only C could decide and the latter was quite sure that A alone had the power to act. After several laps of this circulus vivios it dawned upon me that my reward was a castle in Spain. The utter failure of my attempts to raise capital for development was another disappointment and when Mr. Batchellor pressed me to go to America with a view of redesigning the Edison machines, I determined to try my fortunes in the Land of Golden Promise. But the chance was nearly missed. I liquefied my modest assets, secured accommodations and found myself at the railroad station as the train was pulling out. At that moment I discovered that my money and tickets were gone. What to do was the question. Hercules had plenty of time to deliberate but I had to decide while running alongside the train with opposite feelings surging in my brain like condenser oscillations. Resolve, helped by dexterity, won out in the nick of time and upon passing through the usual experiences, as trivial as unpleasant, I managed to embark for New York with the remnants of my belongings, some poems and articles I had written, and a package of calculations relating to solutions of an unsolvable integral and to my flying machine. During the voyage I sat most of the time at the stern of the ship watching for an opportunity to save somebody from a watery grave, without the slightest thought of danger. Later when I had absorbed some of the practical American sense I shivered at the recollection and marvelled at my former folly.

I wish that I could put in words my first impressions of this country. In the Arabian Tales I read how genii transported people into a land of dreams to live through delightful adventures. My case was just the reverse. The genii had carried me from a world of dreams into one of realities. What I had left was beautiful, artistic and fascinating in every way; what I saw here was machined, rough and unattractive. A burly policeman was twirling his stick which looked to me as big as a log. I approached him politely with the request to direct me. “Six blocks down, then to the left,” he said, with murder in his eyes. “Is this America?” I asked myself in painful surprise. “It is a century behind Europe in civilization.” When I went abroad in 1889—5 years having elapsed since my arrival here—I became convinced that it was more than one hundred years AHEAD of Europe and nothing has happened to this day to change my opinion.

The meeting with Edison was a memorable event in my life. I was amazed at this wonderful man who, without early advantages and scientific training, had accomplished so much. I had studied a dozen languages, delved in literature and art, and had spent my best years in libraries reading all sorts of stuff that fell into my hands, from Newton's “Principia” to the novels of Paul de Kock, and felt that most of my life had been squandered. But it did not take long before I recognized that it was the best thing I could have done. Within a few weeks I had won Edison's confidence and it came about in this way.

The S.S. Oregon, the fastest passenger steamer at that time, had both of its lighting machines disabled and its sailing was delayed. As the superstructure had been built after their installation it was impossible to remove them from the hold. The predicament was a serious one and Edison was much annoyed. In the evening I took the necessary instruments with me and went aboard the vessel where I stayed for the night. The dynamos were in bad condition, having several short-circuits and breaks, but with the assistance of the crew I succeeded in putting them in good shape. At 5:00 a.m. when passing along Fifth Avenue on my way to the shop, I met Edison with Batchellor and a few others as they were returning home to retire. “Here is our Parisian running around at night,” he said. When I told him that I was coming from the Oregon and had repaired both machines, he looked at me in silence and walked away without another word. But when he had gone some distance I heard him remark: “Batchellor, this is a d—n good man.” and from that time on I had full freedom in directing the work. For nearly a year my regular hours were from 10:30 a.m. until 5:00 a.m. the next morning without a day's exception. Edison said to me: “I have had many hard-working assistants but you take the cake.” During this period I designed twenty-four different types of standard machines with short cores and of uniform pattern which replaced the old ones. The Manager had promised me $50,000 on the completion of this task but it turned out to be a practical joke. This gave me a painful shock and I resigned my position.

Immediately thereafter some people approached me with the proposal of forming an arc light company under my name, to which I agreed. Here finally was an opportunity to develop the motor, but when I broached the subject to my new associates they said: “No, we want the arc lamp. We don't care for this alternating current of yours.” In 1886 my system of arc lighting was perfected and adopted for factory and municipal lighting, and I was free, but with no other possession than a beautifully engraved certificate of stock of hypothetical value. Then followed a period of struggle in the new medium for which I was not fitted, but the reward came in the end and in April, 1887, the Tesla Electric Company was organized, providing a laboratory and facilities. The motors I built there were exactly as I had imagined them. I made no attempt to improve the design, but merely reproduced the pictures as they appeared to my vision and the operation was always as I expected.

In the early part of 1888 an arrangement was made with the Westinghouse Company for the manufacture of the motors on a large scale. But great difficulties had still to be overcome. My system was based on the use of low frequency currents and the Westinghouse experts had adopted 133 cycles with the object of securing advantages in the transformation. They did not want to depart from their standard forms of apparatus and my efforts had to be concentrated upon adapting the motor to these conditions. Another necessity was to produce a motor capable of running efficiently at this frequency on two wires which was not easy to accomplishment.

At the close of 1889, however, my services in Pittsburg being no longer essential, I returned to New York and resumed experimental work in a laboratory on Grand Street, where I began immediately the design of high frequency machines. The problems of construction in this unexplored field were novel and quite peculiar and I encountered many difficulties. I rejected the inductor type, fearing that it might not yield perfect sine waves which were so important to resonant action. Had it not been for this I could have saved myself a great deal of labor. Another discouraging feature of the high frequency alternator seemed to be the inconstancy of speed which threatened to impose serious limitations to its use. I had already noted in my demonstrations before the American Institution of Electrical Engineers that several times the tune was lost, necessitating readjustment, and did not yet foresee, what I discovered long afterwards, a means of operating a machine of this kind at a speed constant to such a degree as not to vary more than a small fraction of one revolution between the extremes of load.

From many other considerations it appeared desirable to invent a simpler device for the production of electric oscillations. In 1856 Lord Kelvin had exposed the theory of the condenser discharge, but no practical application of that important knowledge was made. I saw the possibilities and undertook the development of induction apparatus on this principle. My progress was so rapid as to enable me to exhibit at my lecture in 1891 a coil giving sparks of five inches. On that occasion I frankly told the engineers of a defect involved in the transformation by the new method, namely, the loss in the spark gap. Subsequent investigation showed that no matter what medium is employed, be it air, hydrogen, mercury vapor, oil or a stream of electrons, the efficiency is the same. It is a law very much like that governing the conversion of mechanical energy. We may drop a weight from a certain height vertically down or carry it to the lower level along any devious path, it is immaterial insofar as the amount of work is concerned. Fortunately however, this drawback is not fatal as by proper proportioning of the resonant circuits an efficiency of 85％ is attainable. Since my early announcement of the invention it has come into universal use and wrought a revolution in many departments. But a still greater future awaits it. When in 1900 I obtained powerful discharges of 100 feet and flashed a current around the globe, I was reminded of the first tiny spark I observed in my Grand Street laboratory and was thrilled by sensations akin to those I felt when I discovered the rotating magnetic field.





Chapter 5　The Magnifying Transmitter


As I review the events of my past life I realize how subtle are the influences that shape our destinies. An incident of my youth may serve to illustrate. One winter's day I managed to climb a steep mountain, in company with other boys. The snow was quite deep and a warm southerly wind made it just suitable for our purpose. We amused ourselves by throwing balls which would roll down a certain distance, gathering more or less snow, and we tried to outdo one another in this exciting sport. Suddenly a ball was seen to go beyond the limit, swelling to enormous proportions until it became as big as a house and plunged thundering into the valley below with a force that made the ground tremble. I looked on spellbound, incapable of understanding what had happened. For weeks afterwards the picture of the avalanche was before my eyes and I wondered how anything so small could grow to such an immense size. Ever since that time the magnification of feeble actions fascinated me, and when, years later, I took up the experimental study of mechanical and electrical resonance, I was keenly interested from the very start. Possibly, had it not been for that early powerful impression, I might not have followed up the little spark I obtained with my coil and never developed my best invention, the true history of which I'll tell here for the first time. es of load.

“Lionhunters” have often asked me which of my discoveries I prize most. This depends on the point of view. Not a few technical men, very able in their special departments, but dominated by a pedantic spirit and near-sighted, have asserted that excepting the induction motor I have given to the world little of practical use. This is a grievous mistake. A new idea must not be judged by its immediate results. My alternating system of power transmission came at a psychological moment, as a long-sought answer to pressing industrial questions, and although considerable resistance had to be overcome and opposing interests reconciled, as usual, the commercial introduction could not be long delayed. Now, compare this situation with that confronting my turbine, for example. One should think that so simple and beautiful an invention, possessing many features of an ideal motor, should be adopted at once and, undoubtedly, it would under similar conditions. But the prospective effect of the rotating field was not to render worthless existing machinery; on the contrary, it was to give it additional value. The system lent itself to new enterprise as well as to improvement of the old. My turbine is an advance of a character entirely different. It is a radical departure in the sense that its success would mean the abandonment of the antiquated types of prime movers on which billions of dollars have been spent. Under such circumstances the progress must be slow and perhaps the greatest impediment is encountered in the prejudicial opinions created in the minds of experts by organized opposition. Only the other day I had a disheartening experience when I met my friend and former assistant, Charles F. Scott, now professor of Electrical Engineering at Yale. I had not seen him for a long time and was glad to have an opportunity for a little chat at my office. Our conversation naturally enough drifted on my turbine and I became heated to a high degree. “Scott,” I exclaimed, carried away by the vision of a glorious future, “my turbine will scrap all the heat-engines in the world.” Scott stroked his chin and looked away thoughtfully, as though making a mental calculation. “That will make quite a pile of scrap,” he said, and left without another word!es of load.

These and other inventions of mine, however, were nothing more than steps forward in certain directions. In evolving them I simply followed the inborn sense to improve the present devices without any special thought of our far more imperative necessities. The “Magnifying Transmitter” was the product of labors extending through years, having for their chief object the solution of problems which are infinitely more important to mankind than mere industrial development.

If my memory serves me right, it was in November, 1890, that I performed a laboratory experiment which was one of the most extraordinary and spectacular ever recorded in the annals of Science. In investigating the behaviour of high frequency currents I had satisfied myself that an electric field of sufficient intensity could be produced in a room to light up electrodeless vacuum tubes. Accordingly, a transformer was built to test the theory and the first trial proved a marvelous success. It is difficult to appreciate what those strange phenomena meant at that time. We crave for new sensations but soon become indifferent to them. The wonders of yesterday are today common occurrences. When my tubes were first publicly exhibited they were viewed with amazement impossible to describe. From all parts of the world I received urgent invitations and numerous honors and other flattering inducements were offered to me, which I declined.

But in 1892 the demands became irresistible and I went to London where I delivered a lecture before the Institution of Electrical Engineers. It had been my intention to leave immediately for Paris in compliance with a similar obligation, but Sir James Dewar insisted on my appearing before the Royal Institution. I was a man of firm resolve but succumbed easily to the forceful arguments of the great Scotchman. He pushed me into a chair and poured out half a glass of a wonderful brown fluid which sparkled in all sorts of iridescent colors and tasted like nectar. “Now,” said he. “you are sitting in Faraday's chair and you are enjoying whiskey he used to drink.” In both aspects it was an enviable experience. The next evening I gave a demonstration before that Institution, at the termination of which Lord Rayleigh addressed the audience and his generous words gave me the first start in these endeavors. I fled from London and later from Paris to escape favors showered upon me, and journeyed to my home where I passed through a most painful ordeal and illness. Upon regaining my health I began to formulate plans for the resumption of work in America. Up to that time I never realized that I possessed any particular gift of discovery but Lord Rayleigh, whom I always considered as an ideal man of science, had said so and if that was the case I felt that I should concentrate on some big idea.

One day, as I was roaming in the mountains, I sought shelter from an approaching storm. The sky became overhung with heavy clouds but somehow the rain was delayed until, all of a sudden, there was a lightning flash and a few moments after a deluge. This observation set me thinking. It was manifest that the two phenomena were closely related, as cause and effect, and a little reflection led me to the conclusion that the electrical energy involved in the precipitation of the water was inconsiderable, the function of lightning being much like that of a sensitive trigger. Here was a stupendous possibility of achievement. If we could produce electric effects of the required quality, this whole planet and the conditions of existence on it could be transformed. The sun raises the water of the oceans and winds drive it to distant regions where it remains in a state of most delicate balance. If it were in our power to upset it when and wherever desired, this mighty life-sustaining stream could be at will controlled. We could irrigate arid deserts, create lakes and rivers and provide motive power in unlimited amounts. This would be the most efficient way of harnessing the sun to the uses of man. The consummation depended on our ability to develop electric forces of the order of those in nature. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, but I made up my mind to try it and immediately on my return to the United States, in the Summer of 1892, work was begun which was to me all the more attractive, because a means of the same kind was necessary for the successful transmission of energy without wires.

The first gratifying result was obtained in the spring of the succeeding year when I reached tensions of about 1,000,000 volts with my conical coil. That was not much in the light of the present art, but it was then considered a feat. Steady progress was made until the destruction of my laboratory by fire in 1895, as may be judged from an article by T. C. Martin which appeared in the April number of the Century Magazine. This calamity set me back in many ways and most of that year had to be devoted to planning and reconstruction. However, as soon as circumstances permitted, I returned to the task. Although I knew that higher electro-motive forces were attainable with apparatus of larger dimensions, I had an instinctive perception that the object could be accomplished by the proper design of a comparatively small and compact transformer. In carrying on tests with a secondary in the form of a flat spiral, as illustrated in my patents, the absence of streamers surprised me, and it was not long before I discovered that this was due to the position of the turns and their mutual action. Profiting from this observation I resorted to the use of a high tension conductor with turns of considerable diameter sufficiently separated to keep down the distributed capacity, while at the same time preventing undue accumulation of the charge at any point. The application of this principle enabled me to produce pressures of 4,000,000 volts, which was about the limit obtainable in my new laboratory at Houston Street, as the discharges extended through a distance of 16 feet. A photograph of this transmitter was published in the Electrical Review of November, 1898. In order to advance further along this line I had to go into the open, and in the spring of 1899, having completed preparations for the erection of a wireless plant, I went to Colorado where I remained for more than one year. Here I introduced other improvements and refinements which made it possible to generate currents of any tension that may be desired. Those who are interested will find some information in regard to the experiments I conducted there in my article, “The Problem of Increasing Human Energy” in the Century Magazine of June, 1900, to which I have referred on a previous occasion.

I have been asked by the Electrical Experimenter to be quite explicit on this subject so that my young friends among the readers of the magazine will clearly understand the construction and operation of my “Magnifying Transmitter” and the purposes for which it is intended. Well, then, in the first place, it is a resonant transformer with a secondary in which the parts, charged to a high potential, are of considerable area and arranged in space along ideal enveloping surfaces of very large radii of curvature, and at proper distances from one another thereby insuring a small electric surface density everywhere so that no leak can occur even if the conductor is bare. It is suitable for any frequency, from a few to many thousands of cycles per second, and can be used in the production of currents of tremendous volume and moderate pressure, or of smaller amperage and immense electromotive force. The maximum electric tension is merely dependent on the curvature of the surfaces on which the charged elements are situated and the area of the latter.

Judging from my past experience, as much as 100,000,000 volts are perfectly practicable. On the other hand currents of many thousands of amperes may be obtained in the antenna. A plant of but very moderate dimensions is required for such performances. Theoretically, a terminal of less than 90 feet in diameter is sufficient to develop an electromotive force of that magnitude while for antenna currents of from 2,000—4,000 amperes at the usual frequencies it need not be larger than 30 feet in diameter.

In a more restricted meaning this wireless transmitter is one in which the Hertz-wave radiation is an entirely negligible quantity as compared with the whole energy, under which condition the damping factor is extremely small and an enormous charge is stored in the elevated capacity. Such a circuit may then be excited with impulses of any kind, even of low frequency and it will yield sinusoidal and continuous oscillations like those of an alternator.

Taken in the narrowest significance of the term, however, it is a resonant transformer which, besides possessing these qualities, is accurately proportioned to fit the globe and its electrical constants and properties, by virtue of which design it becomes highly efficient and effective in the wireless transmission of energy. Distance is then absolutely eliminated, there being no diminution in the intensity of the transmitted impulses. It is even possible to make the actions increase with the distance from the plant according to an exact mathematical law.

This invention was one of a number comprised in my “World-System” of wireless transmission which I undertook to commercialize on my return to New York in 1900. As to the immediate purposes of my enterprise, they were clearly outlined in a technical statement of that period from which I quote:

The “World-System” has resulted from a combination of several original discoveries made by the inventor in the course of long continued research and experimentation. It makes possible not only the instantaneous and precise wireless transmission of any kind of signals, messages or characters, to all parts of the world, but also the inter-connection of the existing telegraph, telephone, and other signal stations without any change in their present equipment. By its means, for instance, a telephone subscriber here may call up and talk to any other subscriber on the globe. An inexpensive receiver, not bigger than a watch, will enable him to listen anywhere, on land or sea, to a speech delivered or music played in some other place, however distant. These examples are cited merely to give an idea of the possibilities of this great scientific advance, which annihilates distance and makes that perfect natural conductor, the Earth, available for all the innumerable purposes which human ingenuity has found for a line-wire. One far-reaching result of this is that any device capable of being operated through one or more wires (at a distance obviously restricted) can likewise be actuated, without artificial conductors and with the same facility and accuracy, at distances to which there are no limits other than those imposed by the physical dimensions of the globe. Thus, not only will entirely new fields for commercial exploitation be opened up by this ideal method of trans-mission but the old ones vastly extended.

The “World-System” is based on the application of the following important inventions and discoveries:

1.The “Tesla Transformer.” This apparatus is in the production of electrical vibrations as revolutionary as gunpowder was in warfare. Currents many times stronger than any ever generated in the usual ways, and sparks over 100 feet long, have been produced by the inventor with an instrument of this kind.

2.The “Magnifying Transmitter.” This is Tesla's best invention, a peculiar transformer specially adapted to excite the Earth, which is in the transmission of electrical energy what the telescope is in astronomical observation. By the use of this marvelous device he has already set up electrical movements of greater intensity than those of lightning and passed a current, sufficient to light more than two hundred incandescent lamps, around the globe.

3.The “Tesla Wireless System.” This system comprises a number of improvements and is the only means known for transmitting economically electrical energy to a distance without wires. Careful tests and measurements in connection with an experimental station of great activity, erected by the inventor in Colorado, have demonstrated that power in any desired amount can be conveyed, clear across the globe if necessary, with a loss not exceeding a few per cent.

4.The “Art of Individualization.” This invention of Tesla's is to primitive “tuning” what refined language is to unarticulated expression. It makes possible the trans-mission of signals or messages absolutely secret and exclusive both in the active and passive aspect, that is, non-interfering as well as secure. Each signal is like an individual of unmistakable identity and there is virtually no limit to the number of stations or instruments which can be simultaneously operated without the slightest mutual disturbance.

5.“The Terrestrial Stationary Waves.” This wonderful discovery, popularly explained, means that the Earth is responsive to electrical vibrations of definite pitch just as a tuning fork to certain waves of sound. These particular electrical vibrations, capable of powerfully exciting the globe, lend themselves to innumerable uses of great importance commercially and in many other respects.

The first “World-System” power plant can be put in operation in 9 months. With this power plant it will be practicable to attain electrical activities up to ten million horsepower and it is designed to serve for as many technical achievements as are possible without due expense. Among these the following may be mentioned:

(1) The inter-connection of the existing telegraph exchanges or offices all over the world;

(2) The establishment of a secret and secure govern-ment telegraph service;

(3) The inter-connection of all the present telephone exchanges or offices on the globe;

(4) The universal distribution of general news, by telegraph or telephone, in connection with the press;

(5) The establishment of such a “World-System” of intelligence transmission for exclusive private use;

(6) The inter-connection and operation of all stock tickers of the world;

(7) The establishment of a “World-System” of musical distribution, etc.;

(8) The universal registration of time by cheap clocks indicating the hour with astronomical precision and requiring no attention whatever;

(9) The world transmission of typed or handwritten characters, letters, checks, etc.;

(10) The establishment of a universal marine service enabling the navigators of all ships to steer perfectly without compass, to determine the exact location, hour and speed, to prevent collisions and disasters, etc.;

(11) The inauguration of a system of world-printing on land and sea;

(12) The world reproduction of photographic pictures and all kinds of drawings or records.

I also proposed to make demonstrations in the wireless transmission of power on a small scale but sufficient to carry conviction. Besides these I referred to other and incomparably more important applications of my discoveries which will be disclosed at some future date.

A plant was built on Long Island with a tower 187 feet high, having a spherical terminal about 68 feet in diameter. These dimensions were adequate for the transmission of virtually any amount of energy. Originally only from 200 to 300 K.W. were provided but I intended to employ later several thousand horsepower. The transmitter was to emit a wave-complex of special characteristics and I had devised a unique method of telephonic control of any amount of energy.

The tower was destroyed 2 years ago but my projects are being developed and another one, improved in some features, will be constructed. On this occasion I would contradict the widely circulated report that the structure was demolished by the Government which owing to war conditions, might have created prejudice in the minds of those who may not know that the papers, which 30 years ago conferred upon me the honor of American citizenship, are always kept in a safe, while my orders, diplomas, degrees, gold medals and other distinctions are packed away in old trunks. If this report had a foundation I would have been refunded a large sum of money which I expended in the construction of the tower. On the contrary it was in the interest of the Government to preserve it, particularly as it would have made possible—to mention just one valuable result—the location of a submarine in any part of the world. My plant, services, and all my improvements have always been at the disposal of the officials and ever since the outbreak of the European conflict I have been working at a sacrifice on several inventions of mine relating to aerial navigation, ship propulsion and wireless transmission which are of the greatest importance to the country. Those who are well informed know that my ideas have revolutionized the industries of the United States and I am not aware that there lives an inventor who has been, in this respect, as fortunate as myself especially as regards the use of his improvements in the war. I have refrained from publicly expressing myself on this subject before as it seemed improper to dwell on personal matters while all the world was in dire trouble. I would add further, in view of various rumors which have reached me, that Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan did not interest himself with me in a business way but in the same large spirit in which he has assisted many other pioneers. He carried out his generous promise to the letter and it would have been most unreasonable to expect from him anything more. He had the highest regard for my attainments and gave me every evidence of his complete faith in my ability to ultimately achieve what I had set out to do. I am unwilling to accord to some small-minded and jealous individuals the satisfaction of having thwarted my efforts. These men are to me nothing more than microbes of a nasty disease. My project was retarded by laws of nature. The world was not prepared for it. It was too far ahead of time. But the same laws will prevail in the end and make it a triumphal success.





Chapter 6　The Art of Telautomatics


No subject to which I have ever devoted myself has called for such concentration of mind and strained to so dangerous a degree the finest fibers of my brain as the system of which the Magnifying Transmitter is the foundation. I put all the intensity and vigor of youth in the development of the rotating field discoveries, but those early labors were of a different character. Although strenuous in the extreme, they did not involve that keen and exhausting discernment which had to be exercised in attacking the many puzzling problems of the wireless. Despite my rare physical endurance at that period the abused nerves finally rebelled and I suffered a complete collapse, just as the consummation of the long and difficult task was almost in sight. Without doubt I would have paid a greater penalty later, and very likely my career would have been prematurely terminated, had not providence equipped me with a safety device, which has seemed to improve with advancing years and unfailingly comes into play when my forces are at an end. So long as it operates I am safe from danger, due to overwork, which threatens other inventors and, incidentally, I need no vacations which are indispensable to most people. When I am all but used up I simply do as the darkies, who “naturally fall asleep while white folks worry.” To venture a theory out of my sphere—the body probably accumulates little by little a definite quantity of some toxic agent and I sink into a nearly lethargic state which lasts half an hour to the minute. Upon awakening I have the sensation as though the events immediately preceding had occurred very long ago, and if I attempt to continue the interrupted train of thought I feel a veritable mental nausea. Involuntarily I then turn to other work and am surprised at the freshness of the mind and ease with which I overcome obstacles that had baffled me before. After weeks or months my passion for the temporarily abandoned invention returns and I invariably find answers to all the vexing questions with scarcely any effort. In this connection I will tell of an extraordinary experience which may be of interest to students of psychology. I had produced a striking phenomenon with my grounded transmitter and was endeavoring to ascertain its true significance in relation to the currents propagated through the earth. It seemed a hopeless undertaking, and for more than a year I worked unremittingly, but in vain. This profound study so entirely absorbed me that I became forgetful of everything else, even of my undermined health. At last, as I was at the point of breaking down, nature applied the preservative inducing lethal sleep. Regaining my senses I realized with consternation that I was unable to visualize scenes from my life except those of infancy, the very first ones that had entered my consciousness. Curiously enough, these appeared before my vision with startling distinctness and afforded me welcome relief. Night after night, when retiring, I would think of them and more and more of my previous existence was revealed. The image of my mother was always the principal figure in the spectacle that slowly unfolded, and a consuming desire to see her again gradually took possession of me. This feeling grew so strong that I resolved to drop all work and satisfy my longing. But I found it too hard to break away from the laboratory, and several months elapsed during which I had succeeded in reviving all the impressions of my past life up to the spring of 1892. In the next picture that came out of the mist of oblivion, I saw myself at the Hotel de la Paix in Paris just coming to from one of my peculiar sleeping spells, which had been caused by prolonged exertion of the brain. Imagine the pain and distress I felt when it flashed upon my mind that a dispatch was handed to me at that very moment bearing the sad news that my mother was dying. I remembered how I made the long journey home without an hour of rest and how she passed away after weeks of agony! It was especially remarkable that during all this period of partially obliterated memory I was fully alive to everything touching on the subject of my research. I could recall the smallest details and the least significant observations in my experiments and even recite pages of text and complex mathematical formulae.

My belief is firm in a law of compensation. The true rewards are ever in proportion to the labor and sacrifices made. This is one of the reasons why I feel certain that of all my inventions, the Magnifying Transmitter will prove most important and valuable to future generations. I am prompted to this prediction not so much by thoughts of the commercial and industrial revolution which it will surely bring about, but of the humanitarian consequences of the many achievements it makes possible. Considerations of mere utility weigh little in the balance against the higher benefits of civilization. We are confronted with portentous problems which can not be solved just by providing for our material existence, however abundantly. On the contrary, progress in this direction is fraught with hazards and perils not less menacing than those born from want and suffering. If we were to release the energy of atoms or discover some other way of developing cheap and unlimited power at any point of the globe this accomplishment, instead of being a blessing, might bring disaster to mankind in giving rise to dissension and anarchy which would ultimately result in the enthronement of the hated regime of force. The greatest good will comes from technical improvements tending to unification and harmony, and my wireless transmitter is preeminently such. By its means the human voice and likeness will be reproduced everywhere and factories driven thousands of miles from waterfalls furnishing the power; aerial machines will be propelled around the earth without a stop and the sun's energy controlled to create lakes and rivers for motive purposes and transformation of arid deserts into fertile land. Its introduction for telegraphic, telephonic and similar uses will automatically cut out the statics and all other interferences which at present impose narrow limits to the application of the wireless. This is a timely topic on which a few words might not be amiss.

During the past decade a number of people have arrogantly claimed that they had succeeded in doing away with this impediment. I have carefully examined all of the arrangements described and tested most of them long before they were publicly disclosed, but the finding was uniformly negative. A recent official statement from the U.S. Navy may, perhaps, have taught some beguilable news editors how to appraise these announcements at their real worth. As a rule the attempts are based on theories so fallacious that whenever they come to my notice I can not help thinking in a lighter vein. Quite recently a new discovery was heralded, with a deafening flourish of trumpets, but it proved another case of a mountain bringing forth a mouse. This reminds me of an exciting incident which took place years ago when I was conducting my experiments with currents of high frequency. Steve Brodie had just jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. The feat has been vulgarized since by imitators, but the first report electrified New York. I was very impressionable then and frequently spoke of the daring printer. On a hot afternoon I felt the necessity of refreshing myself and stepped into one of the popular thirty thousand institutions of this great city where a delicious 12％ beverage was served which can now be had only by making a trip to the poor and devastated countries of Europe. The attendance was large and not over-distinguished and a matter was discussed which gave me an admirable opening for the careless remark: “This is what I said when I jumped off the bridge.” No sooner had I uttered these words than I felt like the companion of Timotheus in the poem of Schiller. In an instant there was a pandemonium and a dozen voices cried: “It is Brodie!” I threw a quarter on the counter and bolted for the door but the crowd was at my heels with yells: “Stop, Steve!” which must have been misunderstood for many persons tried to hold me up as I ran frantically for my haven of refuge. By darting around corners I fortunately managed—through the medium of a fire-escape—to reach the laboratory where I threw off my coat, camouflaged myself as a hard-working blacksmith, and started the forge. But these precautions proved unnecessary; I had eluded my pursuers. For many years afterwards, at night, when imagination turns into spectres the trifling troubles of the day, I often thought, as I tossed on the bed, what my fate would have been had that mob caught me and found out that I was not Steve Brodie!

Now the engineer, who lately gave an account before a technical body of a novel remedy against statics based on a “heretofore unknown law of nature,” seems to have been as reckless as myself when he contended that these disturbances propagate up and down, while those of a transmitter proceed along the earth. It would mean that a condenser, as this globe, with its gaseous envelope, could be charged and discharged in a manner quite contrary to the fundamental teachings propounded in every elemental text-book of physics. Such a supposition would have been condemned as erroneous, even in Franklin's time, for the facts bearing on this were then well known and the identity between atmospheric electricity and that developed by machines was fully established. Obviously, natural and artificial disturbances propagate through the earth and the air in exactly the same way, and both set up electro-motive forces in the horizontal, as well as vertical, sense. Interference can not be overcome by any such methods as were proposed. The truth is this: in the air the potential increases at the rate of about fifty volts per foot of elevation, owing to which there may be a difference of pressure amounting to twenty, or even forty thousand volts between the upper and lower ends of the antenna. The masses of the charged atmosphere are constantly in motion and give up electricity to the conductor, not continuously but rather disruptively, this producing a grinding noise in a sensitive telephonic receiver. The higher the terminal and the greater the space encompassed by the wires, the more pronounced is the effect, but it must be understood that it is purely local and has little to do with the real trouble. In 1900, while perfecting my wireless system, one form of apparatus comprised four antennae. These were carefully calibrated to the same frequency and connected in multiple with the object of magnifying the action, in receiving from any direction. When I desired to ascertain the origin of the transmitted impulses, each diagonally situated pair was put in series with a primary coil energizing the detector circuit. In the former case the sound was loud in the telephone; in the latter it ceased, as expected, the two antennae neutralizing each other, but the true statics manifested themselves in both instances and I had to devise special preventives embodying different principles.

By employing receivers connected to two points of the ground, as suggested by me long ago, this trouble caused by the charged air, which is very serious in the structures as now built, is nullified and besides, the liability of all kinds of interference is reduced to about one-half, because of the directional character of the circuit. This was perfectly self-evident, but came as a revelation to some simple-minded wireless folks whose experience was confined to forms of apparatus that could have been improved with an axe, and they have been disposing of the bear's skin before killing him. If it were true that strays performed such antics, it would be easy to get rid of them by receiving without aerials. But, as a matter of fact, a wire buried in the ground which, conforming to this view, should be absolutely immune, is more susceptible to certain extraneous impulses than one placed vertically in the air. To state it fairly, a slight progress has been made, but not by virtue of any particular method or device. It was achieved simply by discarding the enormous structures, which are bad enough for transmission but wholly unsuitable for reception, and adopting a more appropriate type of receiver. As I pointed out in a previous article, to dispose of this difficulty for good, a radical change must be made in the system, and the sooner this is done the better.

It would be calamitous, indeed, if at this time when the art is in its infancy and the vast majority, not excepting even experts, have no conception of its ultimate possibilities, a measure would be rushed through the legislature making it a government monopoly. This was proposed a few weeks ago by Secretary Daniels, and no doubt that distinguished official has made his appeal to the Senate and House of Representatives with sincere conviction. But universal evidence unmistakably shows that the best results are always obtained in healthful commercial competition. There are, however, exceptional reasons why wireless should be given the fullest freedom of development. In the first place it offers prospects immeasurably greater and more vital to betterment of human life than any other invention or discovery in the history of man. Then again, it must be understood that this wonderful art has been, in its entirety, evolved here and can be called “American” with more right and propriety than the telephone, the incandescent lamp or the aeroplane. Enterprising press agents and stock jobbers have been so successful in spreading misinformation that even so excellent a periodical as the Scientific American accords the chief credit to a foreign country. The Germans, of course, gave us the Hertz-waves and the Russian, English, French and Italian experts were quick in using them for signaling purposes. It was an obvious application of the new agent and accomplished with the old classical and unimproved induction coil—scarcely anything more than another kind of heliography. The radius of transmission was very limited, the results attained of little value, and the Hertz oscillations, as a means for conveying intelligence, could have been advantageously replaced by sound-waves, which I advocated in 1891. Moreover, all of these attempts were made 3 years after the basic principles of the wireless system, which is universally employed to-day, and its potent instrumentalities had been clearly described and developed in America. No trace of those Hertzian appliances and methods remains today. We have proceeded in the very opposite direction and what has been done is the product of the brains and efforts of citizens of this country. The fundamental patents have expired and the opportunities are open to all. The chief argument of the Secretary is based on interference. According to his statement, reported in the New York Herald of July 29th, signals from a powerful station can be intercepted in every village of the world. In view of this fact, which was demonstrated in my experiments of 1900, it would be of little use to impose restrictions in the United States.

As throwing light on this point, I may mention that only recently an odd looking gentleman called on me with the object of enlisting my services in the construction of world transmitters in some distant land. “We have no money,” he said, “but carloads of solid gold and we will give you a liberal amount.” I told him that I wanted to see first what will be done with my inventions in America, and this ended the interview. But I am satisfied that some dark forces are at work, and as time goes on the maintenance of continuous communication will be rendered more difficult. The only remedy is a system immune against interruption. It has been perfected, it exists, and all that is necessary is to put it in operation.

The terrible conflict is still uppermost in the minds and perhaps the greatest importance will be attached to the Magnifying Transmitter as a machine for attack and defense, more particularly in connection with Telautomatics. This invention is a logical outcome of observations begun in my boyhood and continued throughout my life. When the first results were published the Electrical Review stated editorially that it would become one of the “most potent factors in the advance and civilization of mankind.” The time is not distant when this prediction will be fulfilled. In 1898 and 1900 it was offered to the Government and might have been adopted were I one of those who would go to Alexander's shepherd when they want a favor from Alexander. At that time I really thought that it would abolish war, because of its unlimited destructiveness and exclusion of the personal element of combat. But while I have not lost faith in its potentialities, my views have changed since.

War can not be avoided until the physical cause for its recurrence is removed and this, in the last analysis, is the vast extent of the planet on which we live. Only through annihilation of distance in every respect, as the conveyance of intelligence, transport of passengers and supplies and transmission of energy will conditions be brought about some day, insuring permanency of friendly relations. What we now want most is closer contact and better understanding between individuals and communities all over the earth, and the elimination of that fanatic devotion to exalted ideals of national egoism and pride which is always prone to plunge the world into primeval barbarism and strife. No league or parliamentary act of any kind will ever prevent such a calamity. These are only new devices for putting the weak at the mercy of the strong. I have expressed myself in this regard 14 years ago, when a combination of a few leading governments—a sort of Holy Alliance—was advocated by the late Andrew Carnegie, who may be fairly considered as the father of this idea, having given to it more publicity and impetus than anybody else prior to the efforts of the President. While it can not be denied that such a pact might be of material advantage to some less fortunate peoples, it can not attain the chief object sought. Peace can only come as a natural consequence of universal enlightenment and merging of races, and we are still far from this blissful realization. As I view the world of today, in the light of the gigantic struggle we have witnessed, I am filled with conviction that the interests of humanity would be best served if the United States remained true to its traditions and kept out of “entangling alliances.” Situated as it is, geographically, remote from the theaters of impending conflicts, without incentive to territorial aggrandizement, with inexhaustible resources and immense population thoroughly imbued with the spirit of liberty and right, this country is placed in a unique and privileged position. It is thus able to exert, independently, its colossal strength and moral force to the benefit of all, more judiciously and effectively, than as member of a league.

In one of these biographical sketches, published in the Electrical Experimenter, I have dwelt on the circumstances of my early life and told of an affliction which compelled me to unremitting exercise of imagination and self—observation. This mental activity, at first involuntary under the pressure of illness and suffering, gradually became second nature and led me finally to recognize that I was but an automaton devoid of free will in thought and action and merely responsive to the forces of the environment. Our bodies are of such complexity of structure, the motions we perform are so numerous and involved, and the external impressions on our sense organs to such a degree delicate and elusive that it is hard for the average person to grasp this fact. And yet nothing is more convincing to the trained investigator than the mechanistic theory of life which had been, in a measure, understood and propounded by Descartes 300 years ago. But in his time many important functions of our organism were unknown and, especially with respect to the nature of light and the construction and operation of the eye, philosophers were in the dark. In recent years the progress of scientific research in these fields has been such as to leave no room for a doubt in regard to this view on which many works have been published. One of its ablest and most eloquent exponents is, perhaps, Felix Le Dantec, formerly assistant of Pasteur. Prof. Jacques Loeb has performed remarkable experiments in heliotropism, clearly establishing the controlling power of light in lower forms of organisms, and his latest book, Forced Movements, is revelatory. But while men of science accept this theory simply as any other that is recognized, to me it is a truth which I hourly demonstrate by every act and thought of mine. The consciousness of the external impression prompting me to any kind of exertion, physical or mental, is ever present in my mind. Only on very rare occasions, when I was in a state of exceptional concentration, have I found difficulty in locating the original impulses.

The by far greater number of human beings are never aware of what is passing around and within them, and millions fall victims of disease and die prematurely just on this account. The most common every-day occurrences appear to them mysterious and inexplicable. One may feel a sudden wave of sadness and rake his brain for an explanation when he might have noticed that it was caused by a cloud cutting off the rays of the sun. He may see the image of a friend dear to him under conditions which he construes as very peculiar, when only shortly before he has passed him in the street or seen his photograph somewhere. When he loses a collar button he fusses and swears for an hour, being unable to visualize his previous actions and locate the object directly. Deficient observation is merely a form of ignorance and responsible for the many morbid notions and foolish ideas prevailing. There is not more than one out of every ten persons who does not believe in telepathy and other psychic manifestations, spiritualism and communion with the dead, and who would refuse to listen to willing or unwilling deceivers. Just to illustrate how deeply rooted this tendency has become even among the clear-headed American population, I may mention a comical incident.

Shortly before the war, when the exhibition of my turbines in this city elicited widespread comment in the technical papers, I anticipated that there would be a scramble among manufacturers to get hold of the invention, and I had particular designs on that man from Detroit who has an uncanny faculty for accumulating millions. So confident was I that he would turn up some day, that I declared this as certain to my secretary and assistants. Sure enough, one fine morning a body of engineers from the Ford Motor Company presented themselves with the request of discussing with me an important project. “Didn't I tell you?” I remarked triumphantly to my employees, and one of them said, “You are amazing, Mr. Tesla; everything comes out exactly as you predict.” As soon as these hard-headed men were seated I, of course, immediately began to extol the wonderful features of my turbine, when the spokesmen interrupted me and said, “We know all about this, but we are on a special errand. We have formed a psychological society for the investigation of psychic phenomena and we want you to join us in this undertaking.” I suppose those engineers never knew how near they came to being fired out of my office.

Ever since I was told by some of the greatest men of the time, leaders in science whose names are immortal, that I possess an unusual mind, I bent all my thinking faculties on the solution of great problems regardless of sacrifice. For many years I endeavored to solve the enigma of death, and watched eagerly for every kind of spiritual indication. But only once in the course of my existence have I had an experience which momentarily impressed me as supernatural. It was at the time of my mother's death. I had become completely exhausted by pain and long vigilance, and one night was carried to a building about two blocks from our home. As I lay helpless there, I thought that if my mother died while I was away from her bedside she would surely give me a sign. Two or three months before I was in London in company with my late friend, Sir William Crookes, when spiritualism was discussed, and I was under the full sway of these thoughts. I might not have paid attention to other men, but was susceptible to his arguments as it was his epochal work on radiant matter, which I had read as a student, that made me embrace the electrical career. I reflected that the conditions for a look into the beyond were most favorable, for my mother was a woman of genius and particularly excelling in the powers of intuition. During the whole night every fiber in my brain was strained in expectancy, but nothing happened until early in the morning, when I fell in a sleep, or perhaps a swoon, and saw a cloud carrying angelic figures of marvelous beauty, one of whom gazed upon me lovingly and gradually assumed the features of my mother. The appearance slowly floated across the room and vanished, and I was awakened by an indescribably sweet song of many voices. In that instant a certitude, which no words can express, came upon me that my mother had just died. And that was true. I was unable to understand the tremendous weight of the painful knowledge I received in advance, and wrote a letter to Sir William Crookes while still under the domination of these impressions and in poor bodily health. When I recovered I sought for a long time the external cause of this strange manifestation and, to my great relief, I succeeded after many months of fruitless effort. I had seen the painting of a celebrated artist, representing allegorically one of the seasons in the form of a cloud with a group of angels which seemed to actually float in the air, and this had struck me forcefully. It was exactly the same that appeared in my dream, with the exception of my mother's likeness. The music came from the choir in the church nearby at the early mass of Easter morning, explaining everything satisfactorily in conformity with scientific facts.

This occurred long ago, and I have never had the faintest reason since to change my views on psychical and spiritual phenomena, for which there is absolutely no foundation. The belief in these is the natural outgrowth of intellectual development. Religious dogmas are no longer accepted in their orthodox meaning, but every individual clings to faith in a supreme power of some kind. We all must have an ideal to govern our conduct and insure contentment, but it is immaterial whether it be one of creed, art, science or anything else, so long as it fulfills the function of a dematerializing force. It is essential to the peaceful existence of humanity as a whole that one common conception should prevail.

While I have failed to obtain any evidence in support of the contentions of psychologists and spiritualists, I have proved to my complete satisfaction the automatism of life, not only through continuous observations of individual actions, but even more conclusively through certain generalizations. These amount to a discovery which I consider of the greatest moment to human society, and on which I shall briefly dwell. I got the first inkling of this astounding truth when I was still a very young man, but for many years I interpreted what I noted simply as coincidences. Namely, whenever either myself or a person to whom I was attached, or a cause to which I was devoted, was hurt by others in a particular way, which might be best popularly characterized as the most unfair imaginable, I experienced a singular and undefinable pain which, for want of a better term, I have qualified as “cosmic,” and shortly thereafter, and invariably, those who had inflicted it came to grief. After many such cases I confided this to a number of friends, who had the opportunity to convince themselves of the truth of the theory which I have gradually formulated and which may be stated in the following few words:

Our bodies are of similar construction and exposed to the same external influences. This results in likeness of response and concordance of the general activities on which all our social and other rules and laws are based. We are automata entirely controlled by the forces of the medium being tossed about like corks on the surface of the water, but mistaking the resultant of the impulses from the outside for free will. The movements and other actions we perform are always life preservative and though seemingly quite independent from one another, we are connected by invisible links. So long as the organism is in perfect order it responds accurately to the agents that prompt it, but the moment that there is some derangement in any individual, his self-preservative power is impaired. Everybody understands, of course, that if one becomes deaf, has his eyesight weakened, or his limbs injured, the chances for his continued existence are lessened. But this is also true, and perhaps more so, of certain defects in the brain which deprive the automaton, more or less, of that vital quality and cause it to rush into destruction. A very sensitive and observant being, with his highly developed mechanism all intact, and acting with precision in obedience to the changing conditions of the environment, is endowed with a transcending mechanical sense, enabling him to evade perils too subtle to be directly perceived. When he comes in contact with others whose controlling organs are radically faulty, that sense asserts itself and he feels the “cosmic” pain.

The truth of this has been borne out in hundreds of instances and I am inviting other students of nature to devote attention to this subject, believing that through combined and systematic effort results of incalculable value to the world will be attained.

The idea of constructing an automaton, to bear out my theory, presented itself to me early but I did not begin active work until 1893, when I started my wireless investigations. During the succeeding 2 or 3 years a number of automatic mechanisms, to be actuated from a distance, were constructed by me and exhibited to visitors in my laboratory. In 1896, however, I designed a complete machine capable of a multitude of operations, but the consummation of my labors was delayed until late in 1897. This machine was illustrated and described in my article in the Century Magazine of June, 1900, and other periodicals of that time and, when first shown in the beginning of 1898, it created a sensation such as no other invention of mine has ever produced. In November, 1898, a basic patent on the novel art was granted to me, but only after the Examiner-in-Chief had come to New York and witnessed the performance, for what I claimed seemed unbelievable. I remember that when later I called on an official in Washington, with a view of offering the invention to the Government, he burst out in laughter upon my telling him what I had accomplished. Nobody thought then that there was the faintest prospect of perfecting such a device. It is unfortunate that in this patent, following the advice of my attorneys, I indicated the control as being effected through the medium of a single circuit and a well-known form of detector, for the reason that I had not yet secured protection on my methods and apparatus for individualization. As a matter of fact, my boats were controlled through the joint action of several circuits and interference of every kind was excluded. Most generally I employed receiving circuits in the form of loops, including condensers, because the discharges of my high-tension transmitter ionized the air in the hall so that even a very small aerial would draw electricity from the surrounding atmosphere for hours. Just to give an idea, I found, for instance, that a bulb 12" in diameter, highly exhausted, and with one single terminal to which a short wire was attached, would deliver well on to one thousand successive flashes before all charge of the air in the laboratory was neutralized. The loop form of receiver was not sensitive to such a disturbance and it is curious to note that it is becoming popular at this late date. In reality it collects much less energy than the aerials or a long grounded wire, but it so happens that it does away with a number of defects inherent to the present wireless devices. In demonstrating my invention before audiences, the visitors were requested to ask any questions, however involved, and the automaton would answer them by signs. This was considered magic at that time but was extremely simple, for it was myself who gave the replies by means of the device.

At the same period another larger telautomatic boat was constructed, a photograph of which is shown in this number of the Electrical Experimenter. It was controlled by loops, having several turns placed in the hull, which was made entirely water-tight and capable of submergence. The apparatus was similar to that used in the first with the exception of certain special features I introduced as, for example, incandescent lamps which afforded a visible evidence of the proper functioning of the machine.

These automata, controlled within the range of vision of the operator, were, however, the first and rather crude steps in the evolution of the Art of Telautomatics as I had conceived it. The next logical improvement was its application to automatic mechanisms beyond the limits of vision and at great distance from the center of control, and I have ever since advocated their employment as instruments of warfare in preference to guns. The importance of this now seems to be recognized, if I am to judge from casual announcements through the press of achievements which are said to be extraordinary but contain no merit of novelty, whatever. In an imperfect manner it is practicable, with the existing wireless plants, to launch an aeroplane, have it follow a certain approximate course, and perform some operation at a distance of many hundreds of miles. A machine of this kind can also be mechanically controlled in several ways and I have no doubt that it may prove of some usefulness in war. But there are, to my best knowledge, no instrumentalities in existence today with which such an object could be accomplished in a precise manner. I have devoted years of study to this matter and have evolved means, making such and greater wonders easily realizable.

As stated on a previous occasion, when I was a student at college I conceived a flying machine quite unlike the present ones. The underlying principle was sound but could not be carried into practice for want of a prime-mover of sufficiently great activity. In recent years I have successfully solved this problem and am now planning aerial machines devoid to sustaining planes, ailerons, propellers and other external attachments, which will be capable of immense speeds and are very likely to furnish powerful arguments for peace in the near future. Such a machine, sustained and propelled entirely by reaction, is shown on page 108 and is supposed to be controlled either mechanically or by wireless energy. By installing proper plants it will be practicable to project a missile of this kind into the air and drop it almost on the very spot designated, which may be thousands of miles away. But we are not going to stop at this. Telautomata will be ultimately produced, capable of acting as if possessed of their own intelligence, and their advent will create a revolution. As early as 1898 I proposed to representatives of a large manufacturing concern the construction and public exhibition of an automotive carriage which, left to itself, would perform a great variety of operations involving something akin to judgement. But my proposal was deemed chimerical at that time and nothing came from it.

At present many of the ablest minds are trying to devise expedients for preventing a repetition of the awful conflict which is only theoretically ended and the duration and main issues of which I have correctly predicted in an article printed in the Sun of December 20,1914. The proposed League is not a remedy but on the contrary, in the opinion of a number of competent men, may bring about results just the opposite. It is particularly regrettable that a punitive policy was adopted in framing the terms of peace, because a few years hence it will be possible for nations to fight without armies, ships or guns, by weapons far more terrible, to the destructive action and range of which there is virtually no limit. Any city, at any distance, whatsoever, from the enemy, can be destroyed by him and no power on earth can stop him from doing so. If we want to avert an impending calamity and a state of things which may transform this globe into an inferno, we should push the development of flying machines and wireless transmission of energy without an instant's delay and with all the power and resources of the nation.
