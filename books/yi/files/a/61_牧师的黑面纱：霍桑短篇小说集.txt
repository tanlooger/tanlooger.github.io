牧师的黑面纱：霍桑短篇小说集

译者序


霍桑（Nathaniel Hawthorne，1804—1864）是美国19世纪中期浪漫主义文学最重要的作家。他的创作开始于短篇小说，先后出版了短篇小说集《重讲一遍的故事》（Twice-told Tales，1837）和《古屋青苔》（Mosses from an Old Manse，1846）。1850年出版长篇小说《红字》（The Scarlet Letter），奠定了他的文学地位，继后又出版了《带七个尖顶的阁楼》（The House of the Seven Gables，1851）、《福谷传奇》（The Blithedale Romance，1852）、《玉石雕像》（The Marble Faun，1860）等长篇小说。他还有多种散文、随笔和短篇小说于身后出版问世。

霍桑出生于美国马萨诸塞州塞勒姆，自幼丧父，随寡母在塞勒姆镇的外公家生活，而当地是历史上加尔文教派狂热迫害异端的著名“驱巫案”发生的地方。他深受清教徒意识的影响，从原罪思想出发，以抽象和严酷的“善恶”观念看待事物，认为社会弊病和道德堕落的根源在于人性中一种固有的“恶”。另一方面，他又生活在美国超验主义思潮兴起的时代，超验主义崇尚人文精神，提倡个性解放，强调个人的价值，开启了被称为“美国的文艺复兴”的新时期。霍桑受到这一场重要的思想运动的影响，一度参加过由超验主义者创办的乌托邦式公社布鲁克农场，与超验主义领袖人物爱默生和梭罗也保持着密切的关系。

这看似矛盾的两种影响，在霍桑的世界观里是融合统一的。他抨击宗教狂热和偏执教派的反人道、非人性以及对人的天性的压抑、对精神的摧残；同时，他对资本主义早期发展的社会问题和人性异化深感忧虑，基于宗教“原罪”观念，致力于在人心中挖掘与暴露隐秘的“恶”，希望能引导人们以善行来洗刷罪恶，净化心灵，进而纯洁人心、改进社会。霍桑对人性的罪恶、堕落与病态的揭示，应该说是具有积极意义的。

霍桑的思想观念，使得他的作品呈现出独特的艺术风格。他的作品多采用寓意和象征手法来揭示人性的阴暗与邪恶倾向，以怪诞情节、异域风情、超现实环境来营造一种神秘氛围，并长于刻画人的隐秘思想活动和情感激烈冲突，被称作“黑色浪漫主义”和“心理罗曼史”。

本书所选作品，从各个侧面展示了霍桑创作的思想内涵和艺术特色。其中有几篇突出显示了他的“原罪”观念和对人心中隐秘罪恶的揭示，如《牧师的黑面纱》写一位深受教民敬重的牧师突然在面部罩上一层黑面纱，终生不再摘下。大家凛然生畏，猜想黑面纱背后隐藏着某种秘密或罪恶，而牧师在临终时却说：“我环顾四周，看啊！你们的每一张脸上都有一块黑面纱！”。《小伙子古德曼·布朗》的主人公古德曼·布朗秘密接受魔鬼的邀请，骗过妻子去密林中赴约，结果他发现几乎所有的人，包括“庄重、可敬的虔诚人士以及教会长者、贞洁贵妇和纯洁少女”，甚至自己的妻子，都和自己一样来践魔鬼之约，原来人人的灵魂中都隐藏着秘密的“罪恶”。《能预言的画像》里的那位画家认为：真正的艺术家“必须深入到表象之下去探看……要看到人的心灵深处”，他的画笔能描绘“用魔法在心灵洞穴中唤醒的那种不变的表情”，竟然显示了一对情侣的内心隐秘，也预示了他们可怕的命运。

另几篇小说旨在揭示人类由于内在罪孽而产生的违反自然、有悖伦理和背离道德的欲望和行为。《海德格医生的实验》中的医生以似乎超越造化的神奇实验，给几个追求返老还童、渴望享乐生活的老人制造了一场可笑的幻景，给他们以“教训”。《埃莉诺小姐的斗篷》中的埃莉诺小姐被称为“傲慢者中的最傲慢者”“践踏人类同情心的人”，仅仅因为她对他人尊严的轻蔑与践踏，酿成了可怕的瘟疫。《罗杰·麦尔文的葬礼》里的主人公背弃了神圣的誓言，最后竟以爱子的死亡作为补赎。

霍桑的作品常表现科技发展对人性和社会所产生的破坏作用，《胎记》和《拉帕西尼的女儿》是这方面的代表作。《胎记》中的艾尔默是一位年轻有为的科学家，坚信科学的力量高于一切，执拗地要配制出一种神奇的药剂以去除美丽妻子面部的红色胎记，使之臻于完美，结果害死了妻子。《拉帕西尼的女儿》里那个精神近乎变态的医学家，其科学的探求变异为狂热的野心，不仅培育出各种含毒的艳丽花草，还用自己的女儿做毒物实验，使女儿“成为自己对科学的疯狂热情的牺牲品”，最终葬送了女儿的爱情和生命。霍桑认为，一切野心勃勃、违背伦理、对抗自然规律的科学研究都将酿成悲剧。

霍桑对科学技术的看法，其实也与“原罪”观念有关——在他看来，人类“征服自然”的野心也属于基督教的七罪之列，即人类僭越自然、妄图主宰宇宙的“骄傲”和源于人类压榨自然以求福祉的功利“贪欲”，这与西方自卢梭以来的浪漫主义思潮一脉相承，对我们思考人类与自然的关系颇有启发。事实上霍桑并不简单地、绝对地否定科学技术的发展。以本书收入的《美的艺术家》为例：一个堪称“艺术家”的年轻钟表匠造出了神奇的能飞翔的机械蝴蝶，但因为是出于对美和爱的追求，霍桑并未对他的技艺有丝毫苛责，却抨击了毁灭他的世俗的实用主义和功利主义。《雪人》更是别具一格，描述一对天真无邪的小姐弟堆成的小雪人竟然获得了生命，成了孩子们的玩伴，倒像一篇优美纯净的童话，一首对自然的神奇性的讴歌。但小雪人最终却毁于父亲那被物质化的愚钝头脑，让人读后心情沉重而悲凉。

海德格医生的实验


那个极其古怪的人，年迈的海德格医生，一次邀请四位可敬的朋友到他书房里聚会。客人中有三位是长着白胡须的绅士——梅德本先生、基利格鲁上校和盖斯科因先生，还有一位芳华消萎的女士，叫作威彻利寡妇。他们是一帮阴郁的老家伙，一辈子命运不济，而他们最大的不幸还在于不久就要进入坟墓了。梅德本先生在壮年时代曾是个发达的商人，可是因为一次疯狂的投机生意而丧失了全部财产，现在只不过比乞丐略胜一筹而已。基利格鲁上校在堕落生活的追求中荒废了大好年华，也耗竭了他的健康和体质，从而染上了一大堆疾病，譬如痛风症和其他种种折磨身心的病痛。盖斯科因先生是个身败名裂的政客，恶名昭著，或者至少说至今一直是恶名昭著，直到时间将他埋葬，从而使如今这一代人已不知道他，才得以湮没无闻而不致遗臭万年。至于威彻利寡妇呢，据说当年是个大美人，不过因为某些飞短流长的诽言谤语使得城里的士绅名流都对她侧目而视，许久以来便不得不销声匿迹了。还有一件事值得一提，那三位老绅士——梅德本先生、基利格鲁上校和盖斯科因先生——都是威彻利寡妇早年的情人，有一次为了她争风吃醋，几乎要割断彼此的脖子。在我继续往下说之前先透露一点情况，海德格医生和他的四位客人有时会被人们看作有点儿精神失常——上年纪的人当受到眼前的烦恼或者悲惨的回忆骚扰的时候，这种情况确实是常常发生的。

“我亲爱的老朋友们，”海德格医生一面招呼他们就座，一面说，“我在书房里常做一些小小的实验自娱，现在我希望你们来帮助我做这么一次实验。”

假如种种传言确切无误，那么海德格医生的书房一定是个非常怪异的地方。它是一间光线阴暗的老式房间，蜘蛛网在四处结着彩饰，布满了年代久远的尘埃。周围矗立着一些橡木书橱，下层的架子里塞满了一排排巨大的对开本书和黑体字印刷的四开本书，上层架子里则装着羊皮纸封面的十二开本的小书。正中的那个书橱上面，放着一尊希波克拉底(1)的青铜半身雕像，根据权威消息，海德格医生治病时每逢遇到疑难病症便要同这尊雕像磋商。在书房那个最幽暗的角落里，立着一个又高又窄的橡木柜，柜门微微开着一条缝，隐隐约约可以看见里面有一副骷髅。在两个书橱中间挂着一面镜子，高高的布满灰尘的镜面嵌在暗淡无光的镀金镜框里。关于这面镜子有许多稀奇的故事，其中一个故事说，凡是这位医生的死去的病人，其亡灵全都住在这面镜子里，每当医生照镜子的时候，他们就会面对面地凝视着他。书房的对面悬挂着一位年轻女人的全身肖像，身上锦缎刺绣的华服已经凋败褪色，花容玉貌也同服饰一样暗淡无光。大约五十年前，就在海德格医生即将同这位年轻女子结婚之际，她因为偶感不适而吞服了她的恋人所配的一副药剂，便在新婚之夜香消玉殒了。我们还没有说到书房里最奇怪的一件东西，那是一部笨重的对开本大书，用黑皮革封面装订，夹着硕大的银扣。书脊上一个字也没有，谁也说不出它的标题。不过众所周知那是一本魔法书。有一次，一个女仆把它搬起来，只不过想扫一扫灰尘，橱柜里的那副骷髅却发出了咯咯的响声，画里的年轻女子伸出一只脚来走下地板，几张吓人的鬼脸也从镜子里往外窥探，同时，那尊希波克拉底铜像也怒冲冲地皱起了眉头，喝道：“不准动！”

海德格医生的书房就是这个模样。在我们的故事发生的那个夏季的午后，房间的中央放着一张像乌檀木一样漆黑的小圆桌，桌子上放着一只形状美丽、工艺考究的雕花玻璃瓶。阳光从窗外照射进来，透过两块已经褪色的厚重的锦缎窗帘，直接映照在玻璃瓶上，所以玻璃瓶上反射出一片柔和的灿烂光彩，投射到围坐在桌子四周的五个老人那灰白色的面孔上。桌子上还摆放着四个盛香槟酒的玻璃杯子。

“我亲爱的老朋友们，”海德格医生又说了一遍，“我可以仰仗你们的帮助，来进行这次极为奇异的实验吗？”

海德格医生本是一位非常奇特的老绅士，他的怪癖已成为千百个奇异故事的核心。其中一些传说之所以会得以流传，说来惭愧，多半是因为我这个人生性爱讲实话；倘若现在这个故事中任何一段文字会使读者惊诧莫名而心旌动摇，我自当毫无怨尤地承担胡编乱造的罪名。

医生的四位客人听见他讲到准备做实验，都预料那不会是多么奇妙的事，只不过是在一个抽气筒里杀死一只小老鼠，用显微镜查看一片蜘蛛网，或者其他诸如此类的小把戏而已，那是他常常用来折腾亲密朋友们的玩意儿。可是海德格医生并没有等他们回答，便蹒跚着走到书房那头，随后便抱着人们公认为魔法书的那本硕大的黑皮封面的对开本厚书回来了。他解开银扣，把大书打开，从印满黑体字的书页之间拿出了一朵玫瑰花，或者说它曾经是一朵玫瑰花，因为现在它那青翠的嫩叶和绯红的花瓣已经变成了褐色，这朵年代久远的花捏在医生手里似乎随时都会碎成齑粉似的。

“这朵玫瑰花，”海德格医生长叹一声说，“就是这朵凋谢的、快要粉碎的玫瑰花，五十五年前还在盛开怒放哩。这是西尔维娅·华德送给我的，那边就挂着她的画像；我本来准备在婚礼上佩戴它的。五十五年来，它一直被夹在这本旧书的书页之间珍藏着。现在，你们认为这朵半世纪前的玫瑰花可能重现芳菲吗？”

“无稽之谈！”威彻利寡妇说，怒冲冲地把头一甩，“你倒不如问一个老太婆满是皱纹的脸能不能再现青春哩。”

“那就瞧着吧！”海德格医生答道。

他打开瓶口，把那朵枯萎的玫瑰花扔进瓶中的水里。一开始，这朵花轻轻地浮在水面上，看上去一点也没有吸收水的湿气。可是没过多久，便可以看出开始发生一种奇妙的变化。那些压扁了和干枯了的花瓣微微颤动，色泽渐渐加深为绯红，仿佛那花朵正从死一般的沉睡中苏醒过来；纤弱的茎干和缀着叶片的细枝变得青翠了；半个世纪前的一朵玫瑰花看上去是那样鲜嫩，就好像当初西尔维娅刚刚赠送给她爱人时一样。它还说不上是盛开怒放；因为还有些娇嫩的红叶轻轻地蜷曲在它那湿润的花心周围，而花心里还有两三点露珠在闪闪发光。

“这确实是一手挺妙的把戏，”医生的朋友们说，他们满不在乎，因为大家曾经在魔术师的演出中看到过更精彩的奇迹，“请你说说，这是怎么弄出来的呀？”

“你们从来没有听说过‘青春之泉’吗？”海德格医生问道，“西班牙探险家朋斯·德·勒昂在两三个世纪之前就在寻找它了。”

“可是朋斯·德·勒昂到底找到它没有呢？”威彻利寡妇问道。

“没有，”海德格医生回答，“因为他根本没有往正确的地方寻找。如果我所听说的情况是正确的，这口著名的‘青春之泉’应该位于佛罗里达半岛的南部，距马卡科湖不远。它的源头被覆盖在几株巨大的木兰树下，那些木兰树尽管生长了许多世纪，但因为获得了奇妙的泉水的滋养，一直长得像紫罗兰一般娇艳。我的一位朋友知道我对这类事物素来好奇，便给我送来了你们所看到的瓶子里的东西。”

“嗯哼！”基利格鲁上校说，他对医生所说的故事连一个字也不相信。“那么这种液体对于人的身体可能产生什么效果呢？”

“这你自己去判断好了，我亲爱的上校。”海德格医生回答，“在座诸位，我的尊敬的老朋友，欢迎你们尽量饮用这种妙不可言的液体，重放你们的青春之花吧。至于我本人，既然在渐入老境的过程中备尝了许多苦恼，倒也不急于再返老还童了。所以恳请各位允许，让我仅限于旁观这次实验的进程好了。”

海德格医生一面说着，一面将“青春之泉”的水液倾注到四只香槟酒杯里面。这液体里显然饱含着起泡的气体，因为有许多小泡沫从杯底不断地升起，到了水面便爆裂成银色的雾气。因为这液体散发着令人愉悦的芬芳，几个老人也就毫不怀疑它具有使人兴奋和舒畅的性质；尽管他们对于其返老还童的功能持绝对怀疑的态度，却也愿意立即将它一口吞下。可是海德格医生要求他们稍等片刻。

“在你们饮用之前，我尊敬的老朋友们，”他说，“最好运用一生所获的经验来作为指导，先拟定几条一般的规则作为人生的指南，以便再次经历青春时期的种种危险。请想一想，假如你们享有了这种特别的好处，却又不能在美德和智慧方面成为当代青年人的楷模，那将是何等的罪孽和耻辱！”

医生的四位可敬的朋友并不回答他，只发出一阵微弱的震颤的笑声；既然大家已经懂得在错误之后悔恨必将接踵而至，可医生却认为他们竟然会再入歧途，这种想法也真是太可笑了。

“那么，喝吧！”医生说，一面躬身作礼，“我很高兴能选择到这么合适的人来做我的实验对象。”

他们用麻痹的手把酒杯举到嘴唇边。假如这种液体真的具有海德格医生所认定的功效，那么世界上再也找不出比这四位更迫切需要它的人了。他们看上去似乎从来不懂得青春和享乐到底为何物，只像是造化在老年昏聩时产下的子孙，生来便是些灰白、老朽、枯槁和悲惨的动物，现在佝偻着身子围坐在医生的桌子边，即使眼前有了返老还童的希望，灵魂或肉体里也无法激起足够的活力。他们把那液体一饮而尽，再把杯子放回到桌子上。

确实，这几个人的面容几乎立即就有所改观，就好像饮下了一杯浓郁美酒似的，他们的脸上顿时闪耀着欢乐阳光的灿烂光辉。他们的脸颊上洋溢着健康的色彩，取代了原来那种使他们貌如死尸的灰白色泽。他们互相凝视着，相信真的有某种魔力开始抹平“时间老人”长期以来一直在他们的额头上深深镌刻的那些悲惨的皱纹。威彻利寡妇整理起她的帽子来，因为她几乎觉得自己又重新是个年轻女人了。

“再给我们一些这种神奇的水！”他们急切地叫喊着，“我们已经年轻一些了——不过还仍然太老！快点——再给一些！”

“耐心些，耐心些！”海德格医生说，他坐在那儿，以哲学家的冷静态度观察着这次实验，“你们花了很长的时间才慢慢变老的。现在半个钟头就变得年轻了，实在应该感到满意啦！不过，这水倒是可以任你们饮用。”

他再次向他们的杯子里斟满青春之水，而瓶子里留下的仍有许多，足以让整个城市一半的老人返回到他们孙子的年龄。当泡沫还在杯缘闪耀之时，医生的四位客人便从桌子上抢过玻璃杯，一口吞尽了杯中之物。这难道是幻觉吗？甚至在那口水正流下他们喉咙的时刻，他们全身的器官似乎就即刻发生了变化。他们的眼睛变得清晰而明亮了；他们那银白的发丝渐渐加深了色泽；坐在桌子旁边的，竟是三位中年绅士和一位刚刚越过风华盛年的妇人。

“我亲爱的寡妇，你真迷人！”基利格鲁上校大叫道；他目不转睛地紧盯着她的脸，而在她的脸上岁月的黑影正在迅速消失，犹如黑夜在绯红的黎明中消失一样。

美丽的寡妇从来就明白，基利格鲁上校的奉承总是不能当成真话的；因此她猛地跳起来，跑到镜子跟前，心里仍然惧怕自己所面对的会是一张老太婆的丑陋面容。与此同时，那三位绅士的行为也足以证明“青春之泉”的神水的确具有某种令人陶醉的性质，除非他们那种精神亢奋是由于猛然解除了年龄的重担，因而变得飘飘然了。盖斯科因先生的心思不断地考虑着政治问题，不过这些问题到底是关系到现在、过去或者将来，就不是轻易能确定的了，因为那些见解和词句在这五十年来都是同样的流行。他时而放开喉咙滔滔不绝地吼叫着关于爱国主义、民族光荣和人民权利的口号；时而躲躲闪闪、含含糊糊地悄声细语，咕哝着提出这种那种危险，态度谨慎得几乎连他自己的良知也无法捉摸其中的奥秘；时而他又用抑扬顿挫的腔调和毕恭毕敬的语气说着话，仿佛某位君主正在倾听他精雕细琢的词句。基利格鲁上校一直在反复高唱一支欢乐的饮酒歌，还敲击着玻璃杯来给自己伴奏，同时用眼光上下扫视着威彻利寡妇那丰满的体态。梅德本先生坐在桌子另一边，正专心致志一元一分地计算着钱，想用这笔钱来开办一种新奇的买卖，准备驾驭一队鲸鱼到北极去搬运冰山，再到东印度去做卖冰的生意。

至于威彻利寡妇，她正站在镜子前面对着自己的影像屈膝行礼，痴笑不已，她还朝它打招呼，仿佛那个影子是她在世上最亲爱的朋友似的。她探头把自己的脸凑近镜子，想看清长久存在于自己记忆中的那些皱纹和鱼尾纹是否真正消失了。她仔细查看头发里的那些银丝是否已经完全转黑，以便能将那顶肃然可敬的帽子安全地扔到一边去。她终于轻盈地转过身子，踏着舞步向桌子走去。

“我亲爱的老医生，”她高喊道，“请再给我一杯！”

“当然可以，我亲爱的女士，当然可以！”医生殷勤地回答说，“瞧！我已经把杯子斟满了。”

事实上，四只玻璃杯都满满地斟上了这种神奇的水，水面上沸腾的泡沫散发而成的纤细雾沫就仿佛是金刚钻在闪烁光辉。这时正接近日落时分，书房比刚才更幽暗了；但是玻璃瓶里放射出一种柔和的、月光似的华彩，映照在四位客人和医生身上。医生坐在一把高靠背的、雕镂精美的橡木扶手椅上，显示出一种年高德劭的尊严，颇有“时间老人”的气派，而“时间老人”的权威除了这几位幸运者外是从来不曾受到过非议的。甚至当他们一口气喝下第三杯“青春之泉”的时候，医生那神秘莫测的面容也几乎使他们深感敬畏。

可是紧接着，青春生命的活力猛然喷涌，贯通了他们周身的经脉。现在他们已经回到了幸福的青春盛年。而老年，连同它那一连串悲惨的忧虑、痛苦和疾病，回忆起来只不过像一场噩梦的骚扰而已，他们如今从梦中快乐地醒过来了。他们的心灵本已过早地失去了鲜亮的光彩，而一旦心灵变得灰暗无光，世上一切接续变幻的景象就只不过像挂满褪色图画的画廊而已；可是如今心灵之光又重新恢复了魅力，照耀着他们未来的人生。他们觉得自己就像刚刚创造成的宇宙中刚刚创造出来的生灵。

“我们年轻了！我们年轻了！”他们欣喜若狂地高喊道。

青春，也像极端衰老一样，把中年的一切显著特征抹消，将它们同化吸收。他们现在变成一群快活的年轻人了。由于这种年龄所特有的纵情欢闹的劲儿，他们几乎变得疯狂起来。他们的欢乐情绪非常奇怪地化为一种冲动，要对虚弱和衰老加以嘲弄，而他们自己刚才还是这样的牺牲品呢。他们对自己款式老旧的衣着高声嘲笑——年轻小伙子竟然穿着下摆阔大的外套和翻着褶边的马甲，妙龄女郎居然戴着老式便帽，穿着老式长袍。他们当中的一个人学着患痛风病的老祖父的样子，跛着脚在地上一瘸一拐地走路；另一个把一副眼镜架在鼻子上，假装仔细阅读那本魔术书里的黑体字；第三个则坐在扶手椅上，极力模仿海德格医生那尊严可敬的风度。接着大家一齐欢乐地大声吼叫，在屋子里四处蹦跳。威彻利寡妇——假使这么娇艳的大姑娘可以叫作寡妇的话——跑到医生的椅子跟前，玫瑰般红润的脸上带着调皮的快活神情。

“医生，亲爱的老头儿，”她叫道，“起来同我跳舞吧！”

接着，三个小伙子发出了比刚才更响亮的大笑声，他们想象着那可怜的老医生跳起舞来会是一副多么古怪的模样。

“请原谅，”医生静静地回答说，“我既衰老又有风湿症，而且我跳舞的时代也早已过去了。不过这三位快活的年轻绅士中的任何一位都乐意有你这么美丽的舞伴呢。”

“同我跳吧，克拉拉！”基利格鲁上校嚷着。

“不，不，我要做她的舞伴！”盖斯科因先生大叫道。

“她答应嫁给我的，在五十年前！”梅德本先生高喊着。

他们围在她身边。一个人激情澎湃地抓住她的双手，另一个用双臂抱住她的腰，第三个则把一只手插进寡妇帽子下面一簇簇光亮的鬈发里。她满面羞红，喘着气，挣扎着，责骂着，大笑着，温暖的呼吸依次吹拂着三个人的面颊；她竭力要挣脱出来，却仍然停留在三个人的拥抱之中。再也找不到一幅比这更生动的图画，来表现年轻人为获取令人神魂颠倒的美女而争风吃醋的情景了！然而因为房间里光线幽暗，也因为他们仍然身穿古旧的服装，据说产生了一种奇异的幻象，当时那面高高的镜子里映照出来的，却是三个衰老、阴郁、枯槁的老头子，正在荒唐地向一个皮包骨头的丑陋的鸡皮老妇争宠哩。

不过他们的确变年轻了：他们燃烧的情欲证明了这一点。妙龄寡妇半推半就地卖弄风情，把三个情敌的欲火煽动得近乎疯狂，他们开始恶狠狠地怒目相向。大家一面仍然牢牢抓紧这个美丽的俘获物，同时凶猛地扼住彼此的咽喉。他们从屋子的这头厮打到那头，桌子被掀翻了，玻璃瓶也被撞到地下摔成了上千的碎片。宝贵的“青春之泉”在地板上像一条发光的小溪淌流着，弄湿了一只蝴蝶的翅膀；这只蝴蝶在夏季将尽的时候已经衰老，正栖息在那里奄奄待毙。突然，这只虫子在屋子里翩翩飞舞起来，然后停落在海德格医生白发如雪的头顶上。

“好啦，好啦，先生们！——好啦，威彻利太太！”医生高声说，“我真得抗议你们这样胡闹了。”

他们站住不动，突然战抖起来；仿佛白发的“时间老人”正把他们从阳光灿烂的青春召回，再把他们放逐到岁月的寒冷而黑暗的幽谷中去。他们望着海德格医生，老医生仍然坐在他那张雕花的扶手椅上，手里拿着那朵半个世纪以前的玫瑰花，这是他从粉碎的玻璃瓶中抢救出来的。他做了个手势，四个胡闹的人便回到了自己的座位上；他们倒也乐意这样做，因为剧烈的活动已经让他们精疲力竭了，尽管他们是年轻人。

“我可怜的西尔维娅的玫瑰花啊！”海德格医生突发感叹，把那朵花举在日落时分云彩映照出的余晖中，“它似乎又在枯萎了。”

确实如此。就在那四个人凝视着它的时候，那朵花不断地萎缩着，直到它变得像海德格医生将它投入玻璃瓶时那样干枯和脆弱。医生抖掉了仍然附着在花瓣上的几滴水珠。

“我爱它现在的样子，正如爱它露珠盈盈时的鲜嫩。”他说道，一面把那朵枯槁的玫瑰贴在他枯槁的嘴唇上。就在他说话的时候，那只蝴蝶也从医生雪白的头顶上振翅飞下，跌回到地面。

他的客人们再次战抖起来。一股奇异的寒气——是在身体里还是在灵魂里，他们自己也说不清——渐渐渗透到了全身。他们互相凝视着，只觉得时间每过一刹那就从身上带走了一丝魔力，只剩下一道愈来愈深的从来没有人堕入过的幽谷。这是一种幻觉吗？难道一生的变幻就被挤压进这么一个短暂的时空中，他们现在又成了四个老人，坐在老朋友海德格医生的身边吗？

“我们又变老了吗，就这么快？”他们悲惨地哭喊道。

事实上他们已经老了。“青春之泉”只有短暂的功效，还比不上酒的作用持久。它所产生的振奋狂喜，也像泡沫一样化为乌有了。是啊！他们又变老了。寡妇突然打了一个寒战，这显示她依然是个老妇人，她用一双皮包骨头的手紧紧地掩住面孔，心里唯愿棺材盖把它盖住，因为这张脸再也不能变得美丽了。

“是啊，朋友们，你们又变老了，”海德格医生说。“看哪！青春之水全都抛洒在了地上！哦——我倒并不为它惋惜；因为纵然这泉水就在我的门前喷涌，我也不会俯身下去沾湿我的嘴唇——不，即使它的美妙幻景能够延续多年而不是转瞬即逝，我也不干。这就是你们给我的教训！”

可是医生的四位朋友自己却没有接受这个教训。他们立即决定到佛罗里达去做朝圣旅行，要早、午、晚三次狂饮“青春之泉”。

胎记


上一世纪后期，有一位科学家，一位精通自然哲学各门学问的著名人士。在我们的故事开始之前不久，他体验到一种比任何化学亲和力更有吸引力的精神亲和力，便把自己的实验室交给一个助手去照料，将他英俊面庞上的炉灰烟尘彻底清除，将手指上的酸液污斑刷洗干净，然后打动了一个美丽女郎的芳心，使她成了自己的妻子。在那个时代，对电和大自然其他类似奥秘的新近发现，似乎开辟了进入奇迹境界的众多途径，因此对于科学的热爱竟然能与对女性的热恋在深度和精力专注程度上一竞高低，也就算不得什么特别的事情了。高超的智力、想象力、精神，甚至心灵，都能在各种科学追求中寻找到与之相宜的养料；正如当时一些科学的热忱倡导者所深信的，这些追求会在强大的智慧阶梯上步步攀登，直到自然哲学家最后把握到宇宙创造力的秘密，或许还能进而为自己开创一片崭新的天地呢。我们不知道这位艾尔默是否对人类最终控制大自然抱有这种高度的信心。不过，他的确毫无保留地献身于科学研究，任何别的激情与之相比都有所逊色，绝不能使他放弃对科学的追求。他对年轻娇妻的爱也许可以说是强于他对科学的爱；但是这种爱也只有与他对科学的爱互相交织，并让科学的力量与他自己的力量相结合，才会如此强烈。

两者的这种结合自然就发生了，并且导致了真正惊人的后果和深刻感人的教训。有一天，就在他们婚后不久，艾尔默坐在那儿凝视着妻子，表情中显示出越来越强烈的烦恼，最后终于说话了。

“乔治亚娜，”他说，“你从来没想过脸上的那块胎记也许可以弄掉吗？”

“不，真的没想过。”她说，微微一笑；可是她察觉到丈夫态度的严肃，霎时脸色通红。“说实话，别人常常说它妩媚动人，我也就当真以为是这样了。”

“啊，要是长在另一个人脸上也许是的，”丈夫答道，“但长在你的脸上绝非如此。不，最亲爱的乔治亚娜，大自然之手把你造得几乎十全十美，所以这一点微乎其微的瑕疵——我也拿不准该叫它瑕疵还是美丽——却令我震惊，因为它是人世缺憾的明显标记。”

“令你震惊，我的丈夫！”乔治亚娜叫道，她受到了很深的伤害，一时气愤得满面通红，接着眼泪便夺眶而出。“那你为什么从我母亲身边把我娶来？你当然不能爱一个令你震惊的人！”

要解释这场谈话，必须提到乔治亚娜左边脸颊中央有一个特殊的印记，仿佛与她面部的肌肤组织深深地渗合在一起。当她的肤色处于平常状态时——一种虽然娇嫩但很健康的肤色——这个印记便带着较深的红晕，在周围的玫瑰红中显露出不规则的形状。当她脸红的时候，这个印记便会渐渐变得更加模糊，最后消失在满面焕发光彩的一片红潮之中。可是，只要她情绪发生变化而脸色转为苍白，那个印记又会再次显现，犹如白雪之中呈现出一点深红，有时候真让艾尔默觉得它清晰得近乎可怕。它的形状很像人的一只手，虽说只有最矮小的侏儒的手那样大。乔治亚娜的倾慕者常常说，在她出生时一定有位仙女把纤手按在了这个婴儿的脸上，留下这个印记来显示她具有神奇的禀赋，足以让所有男子一见倾心。许多渴慕若狂的年轻人甚至愿意拿生命来冒险，只要能得到亲吻这神秘手印的特权。不过无须讳言的是，人们因为气质各不相同，对仙女留下的这个手印也会有不同的印象。某些吹毛求疵的人——只不过无一例外都与她同一性别——宁愿称这个印记为血手，硬说它大大毁损了乔治亚娜美貌的魅力，使她的面目丑得可怕。当然，最纯净的大理石有时也会含有细小的蓝色瑕疵，只需一小点就足以将出自鲍尔斯(1)之手的夏娃雕像变成怪物，这样说也有道理。至于男性观察者们，如果说这个胎记没有增强他们的恋慕，却也宁愿它消失才觉得满意，以便让世界拥有一个毫无瑕疵的合乎理想美的活标本。艾尔默在婚前很少或者说根本没有想过这件事，婚后才发现自己的心愿正是如此。

倘若她没有这么美丽——倘若妒忌之神能找到任何其他嘲弄目标——他也许会因这个手印似的美妙胎记而爱意倍增；它时而朦胧显现，时而消失无影，时而又悄然复归，总伴随着内心深处的情感波动而忽明忽暗、若隐若现。可是既然她除此之外处处都那么完美无缺，随着他们共同生活的时日增进，艾尔默便越来越觉得这个缺点难以容忍。这是人类的一种致命缺陷，大自然总是要以这种或那种方式给它的创造物留下不可磨灭的印记，或者暗示一切事物无不短暂而有限，或者意味着它们的完美还必须经过千辛万苦才能达成。这个深红的手形胎记代表着一只无可逃脱的命运之手，死亡用这只手紧紧抓住最崇高最纯洁的尘世造物，将他们贬到最卑贱的甚至是畜生的地位，让人类有形的躯体也像畜生一样归于尘土。正是按照这种思考方式，艾尔默认定这个胎记乃是妻子无法逃避罪孽、痛苦、腐朽和死亡的象征，他那阴暗的想象力不久就把这个胎记视为不祥之物，这给他带来了越来越多的烦恼和恐惧，压倒了乔治亚娜心灵与容貌的美给他带来的欢乐。

在一切他们应该感到最愉快的时刻，他总会一成不变地回到这个灾难般的话题上来；他并非故意如此，不，他本意想要回避但又身不由己。这件事初看起来微不足道，但它总是同无数联想和各种感觉联系起来，结果变成了一切问题的中心。在曙光朦胧中，艾尔默睁开眼就看见妻子的脸，立即就辨认出那个不完美的标记；在黄昏的炉火旁，当他们并坐在一起时，他的目光会偷偷溜到她的脸颊上，借助柴火摇曳的光线看到那只鬼魅之手忽隐忽现，在他乐于赞赏的地方写下死亡的命数。乔治亚娜不久就形成了一种反应，每逢他凝视自己就不免浑身战栗。只要他在脸上挂着那种惯常的怪异表情对她瞟上一眼，她那玫瑰般红润的脸颊就会变得像死一样苍白。这时那只深红色的手印就会强烈地显现出来，犹如在雪白的大理石上刻出的一块红宝石浮雕。

一个深夜，当光线逐渐暗淡，几乎照不清这位可怜的妻子脸颊上的斑记时，她本人第一次主动提起了这个话题。

“你还记得吗，亲爱的艾尔默？”她说道，勉强露出一丝微笑，“你还记得昨天晚上你梦见了这只可憎的手吗？”

“不！什么也记不得了！”艾尔默答道，他大吃一惊，不过接着就用干涩而冷静的口气补上一句，以便掩饰自己内心深处的真实感情，“也许梦见了吧，因为我在入睡之前心里一直想着它。”

“那你真的梦见它啦？”乔治亚娜匆匆地问，因为她害怕夺眶而出的眼泪会打断她想说的话，“一个可怕的梦！我不相信你会忘记。你难道会忘记这句话吗？——‘它现在在她心里，我们必须把它弄出来！’想一想，我的丈夫，无论如何我都要请你把那个梦回忆出来。”

当包容一切的睡神不能将麾下的幽灵禁锢在她混沌的权力领域内，而听其摆脱羁绊冲脱出来，使实际生活受到那些应当属于意识深处的秘密的恐吓时，心灵便处于一种悲惨的境地。艾尔默现在想起了自己的梦。他梦见自己同仆人阿米那达勃一道，试图用手术除掉那个胎记；可是手术刀切得越深，那个手印也就陷得越深，到后来那只小手竟紧紧抓住了乔治亚娜的心脏。然而她丈夫却执意非把它切下来或者拧下来不可。

当整个梦境完全在记忆中浮现之后，艾尔默怀着愧疚的心情坐在妻子面前。事实真相常常偷偷地潜入被睡眠包裹着的心灵，然后对我们清醒时无意识中自我欺骗的种种行为作无情的揭露。直到现在他才意识到，有一个念头在暴戾地主宰着自己的心灵，而为了求得安宁，他内心的欲望又会发展到怎样的程度。

“艾尔默，”乔治亚娜严肃地接着说下去，“我不知道为了除掉这个不祥的胎记，我们两人可能付出多大代价。说不定去掉它会留下无可救治的残疾，或许这个印记就像生命本身一样的深哩。再说——我们是否知道即使不惜任何代价，到底有没有可能解开这只在我出生之前就已紧紧抓住了我的小手呢？”

“最亲爱的乔治亚娜，对这个问题我已经考虑很久了，”艾尔默急匆匆地打断她的话，“我深信去掉它是完全可行的。”

“就算是只有丝毫的可能性，”乔治亚娜接着说，“也让我们试一试，不管冒多大的风险。我对危险毫不在乎；至于说到生命，既然这个可恨的印记使我成了你恐惧和厌恶的对象——这生命也就成了我乐于扔掉的沉重负担。要么去掉这只可怕的手，要么就夺去我这悲惨的生命！你精通深奥的科学，世人有目共睹。你创造过许多伟大的奇迹。难道你连这么一个小而又小的、我用两个小手指尖都能盖住的斑点都除不掉吗？为了你自己的安宁，也为了拯救你可怜的妻子不至于发疯，这难道是你办不到的吗？”

“最高贵、最亲爱、最温柔的妻子，”艾尔默欣喜若狂，“不要怀疑我的能力。我对这件事已经作过深入的思考——这种思考给我带来的启发几乎能使我造出一个没有你那么完美的人来了。乔治亚娜，你使我比过去更深入地潜入了科学的核心。我觉得自己完全能够把这一侧可爱的脸颊变得与另一侧同样的完美无缺。那时候，最亲爱的，当我纠正了大自然在它最美丽的创造物上留下的瑕疵，我将怎样因成功而欣喜若狂！就连皮格马利翁(2)的少女雕像获得生命的时候，他心中的狂喜也不能和我相比。”

“那就这样决定了，”乔治亚娜露出了一丝微笑，“艾尔默，不要怜惜我，即使你最后发现这个胎记藏进了我的心里。”

她丈夫温柔地吻了吻她的脸颊——她的右脸颊——而不是长着绯红手印的那一边。

第二天，艾尔默向妻子说明自己已经有了一个计划，打算借此机会进行专注思考和持续观察，而这些都是拟议中的手术所必需的；同时乔治亚娜也可以得到彻底休息，这对于手术的成功至为关键。他们要远离尘嚣，退隐到艾尔默做实验室的那个宽阔的房间里去。在这里，他曾度过艰苦劳作的青年时代，在大自然的基本力量方面获得了若干重要发现，赢得了整个欧洲学术界的钦佩。这位脸色苍白的自然哲学家曾静坐在这个实验室里，探索过最高的云区和最深的矿层的秘密；他曾就火山爆发和不断冒火的原因寻找到自己满意的答案；他曾解释喷泉之谜，说明为什么它们从黑暗的地心喷涌而出时有的明澈纯净，有的富于医疗的功效；也是在这里，他曾在早期研究过人类身体的奥妙，试图探测自然之母如何吸取大地与天空以及精神世界的所有精华，创造和养育她的杰作——人类。不过，后面这种研究艾尔默早就弃置一旁了，他虽不情愿却不得不承认一条真理——所有探索者迟早都会在这儿碰钉子——那就是我们伟大的创造之母虽然为让我们快乐，在光天化日之下明明白白地工作着，可是她却小心地严守着自己的秘密，尽管装得公开坦白，却让我们除看到成果之外一无所知。确实，她允许我们损坏，却很少允许我们修补，就像一位心怀戒备的专利占有者，绝不允许我们去进行创造。然而，现在艾尔默又重新进行这些几乎已被遗忘了的研究；当然，他并未执着于当初所抱的希望或者愿望，只是因为这些研究涉及许多生理学方面的真理，而且是治疗乔治亚娜预定方案上必须解决的难题。

当他带着妻子跨过实验室的门槛时，乔治亚娜浑身发冷并且战抖起来。艾尔默兴致很高地望着她，想要让她放心，却吃惊地发现她雪白的脸颊上那个胎记发出灼热的红光，禁不住痉挛似的一阵战栗。他妻子竟然昏了过去。

“阿米那达勃！阿米那达勃！”艾尔默高声大叫，一面用力跺着脚。

从屋子里间立刻跑出一个人来，他个子矮小但身躯庞大，乱蓬蓬的头发吊在脸上，而那张脸则被炉烟熏得狰狞可怖。这个人在艾尔默的全部科学研究生涯中一直充当他的助手，而且对于这项工作十分称职，因为他具有机械式的迅速反应与动作，也具有处理主人实验中一切具体细节的技能，虽然他对于任何一项原理一窍不通。他那强大的力量，蓬乱的头发，满面的烟尘，以及笼罩全身的难以形容的纯朴粗陋，仿佛代表了人类肉体的本性；而艾尔默的颀长身材、苍白而带智慧色彩的面容，则恰好象征着人类的精神素质。

“快打开闺房的门，阿米那达勃，”艾尔默说，“再点燃一支香锭。”

“是的，主人。”阿米那达勃答道，并关注地看了看毫无生气的乔治亚娜；接着他又喃喃自语地说，“假如她是我妻子，我可绝不愿去掉那个胎记。”

当乔治亚娜醒过来的时候，她觉得自己正嗅着一种渗透心脾的芬芳，那香气温和的功效把她从死一般的昏晕中唤醒过来。周围的一切似乎都被施予了魔法。艾尔默已经把这些烟熏火燎、肮脏不堪、昏暗阴郁的房间——他在青春盛年曾在这里进行过艰深研究——改变成一间精美的套房，给一位可爱的女人做幽深的闺房倒颇为合适。墙上悬挂着的华丽帷幔使人既感豪华又觉高雅，其他任何装饰都不可能达到这种效果；那些帷幔从天花板直垂到地板上，层层富丽而厚重的褶皱将所有的尖角与直线都隐藏起来，仿佛要把这个小天地与无限的空间隔离开来。在乔治亚娜看来，这也许是一座仙境楼阁呢。艾尔默把阳光遮挡在外面，害怕它会影响自己的化学实验，却用能够散发香气的灯来取代，它们所燃烧起的五彩的光焰，全都融进一片柔和的紫色光辉中。艾尔默这时跪在妻子身旁，关切地注视着她，但并不惊慌；因为他对自己的科学十分自信，觉得他能在她周围划上一道魔圈，使任何妖孽都难以侵入。

“我在什么地方啊？哦，我想起来了。”乔治亚娜虚弱地说，同时把手放在那块可怕的胎记上，不让丈夫看见。

“别害怕，亲爱的！”他高声说，“别躲避我！相信我，乔治亚娜，我甚至为这个唯一的缺憾感到高兴，因为把它去掉将会带给我巨大的快乐。”

“啊，饶了我吧！”他的妻子哀伤地回答，“请别再去看它了。我永远也忘不了你那痉挛似的战栗。”

为了安抚乔治亚娜，似乎也可以说是为了让她卸掉现实的重负，艾尔默现在开始施行一些从科学的深奥学问中学来的轻松有趣的秘密。许多飘忽的形体、无形的意念和虚幻的美景翩然而至，在她面前舞蹈，把它们转瞬即逝的舞步映照在一道道光柱之上。尽管她对产生这些光学现象的方法也有某些模糊的认识，但这种幻觉却如此近乎完美，足以使她相信自己的丈夫真的拥有控制精神世界的力量。接着，当她觉得自己希望从这幽居独处的地方看看外界的景象时，她这个念头仿佛立即就获得了应答，外界事物随即依次在一块屏幕上飞掠而过。实际生活中的种种景象和人物都栩栩如生地呈现在眼前，但又具有那种令人心醉神迷却又难以形容的差异，正是这种差异使得一幅画、一个形象或者一片阴影比原物更能吸引人。当她厌腻了这种景象之后，艾尔默又要她看一看一只盛着泥土的桶。她照着做了，起初并无兴趣，可是很快就吃惊地发现有一棵植物的幼芽破土而出，接着就长出了纤细的茎干；叶片渐渐地舒展开来；在叶丛中竟然有一朵娇美可爱的花。

“它是一朵魔花！”乔治亚娜叫道，“我可不敢碰它。”

“别怕，把它摘下来吧，”艾尔默回答——“摘下来，抓紧时间嗅它那短暂的香气。这朵花转瞬间就会枯萎，除了褐色的种子荚壳之外什么也不会留下；不过从这粒种子里将会繁殖出一种与它同样短命的花卉。”

可是，乔治亚娜刚一触摸到那朵花，整株植物顿时枯萎，叶子变得焦黑，就像被火烤过似的。

“里面含的刺激剂太强了。”艾尔默若有所思地说。

为了补偿这次失败的实验，他又建议用自己发明的一种科学方法来给她描绘一幅肖像。那是通过光线照射在一块光滑的金属片上来产生的。乔治亚娜同意了，可是她一旦看到结果就惊吓不已：肖像上面容模糊一团，简直看不清是什么，而本该是脸颊的地方却显现出一只小手的形状。艾尔默一把抢过金属片，把它扔进了一个装着腐蚀性酸液的罐子里。

不过他很快就忘记了这些使他丢脸的失败。他有时中断他的研究与化学实验，满面通红、精疲力竭地回到她身边来，但似乎一回到她跟前就立即精神振奋起来，热情洋溢地谈论着自己技艺的种种渊源。他谈起炼金术士王朝的漫长历史，他们耗费了许多世代的光阴，为的是要寻找到一种万能溶剂，它可以从一切低劣微贱的东西中提取出黄金。看来艾尔默深信不疑，根据显而易见的科学逻辑，要发现这种长期寻找的媒质是完全可能的。“不过，”他又补充道，“一个研究如此精深而获得这种能力的科学家，他也会达到极高的智慧，不屑于降格来做这种事了。”他对长生不老药的见解也同样很独特。他明白表示自己完全可以随意调配出一种药剂，能将人的寿命延长许多年，或许能够无限延长。只不过这会造成自然界的不调和，从而招致世人，主要是那些服用长寿药剂的人们的诅咒。

“艾尔默，你说这些是当真的吗？”乔治亚娜又惊又怕地看着丈夫，“有这种本领真是太可怕了，就是梦到自己有这种本领都会害怕的。”

“哦，别怕，亲爱的，”她丈夫说，“我不会对我们自己的生命施行这些乱七八糟的花样来害你或者害自己的。我只不过是要你想一想，去除这只小手印的技艺与此相比是多么微不足道。”

一提到胎记，乔治亚娜顿时就和平时一样畏缩起来，就像有一块烧红的烙铁触到了她的脸颊上。

艾尔默又回头去专心致力于他的工作。她能听见他从远处烧着炉子的房间里传来的说话声，他对阿米那达勃发指示，阿米那达勃用他那粗涩刺耳而又古怪的声音在回答，听起来不像人在说话，倒像一只野兽在哼叫或咆哮。艾尔默离开几个小时之后又回来了，提议说她应当去看看他那个装着化学制品和世间自然珍宝的橱柜。在那些化学制品中，他拿出了一个小药瓶给她看，他说瓶中装着一种柔和而极有威力的香精，能够让整个国度中吹拂的微风都蕴含香味。这个小瓶子里装的东西真具有不可估量的价值；他一边这样说一边朝空中洒出了几滴香精，房间里即刻就充满了强烈而令人振奋的愉悦香味。

“这又是什么呢？”乔治亚娜指着一个盛着金色液体的小水晶球说，“它看上去是那么美，我能够猜想到里面装的是长生不老药。”

“从某种意义上说是这样，”艾尔默回答道，“或者不如说它是一种不朽灵药。它是这个世界上所能配制出来的最宝贵的毒药。我可以用它任意限定你所指定的任何人的寿命。它的剂量可以决定那个人是将生命绵延许多年，还是在瞬息之间就丢命。坐在警卫森严的王座上的国王们没有一个能保住自己的性命，只要我在自己的私室里认定为了千万人的幸福有理由剥夺他的生命。”

“你为什么要保存着这么可怕的药剂呢？”乔治亚娜惊恐地问道。

“别怀疑我，亲爱的，”她的丈夫笑着说，“它的益处比坏处可大得多。看着！这里还有一种强效化妆剂。在一瓶水里滴上几滴，就能把雀斑像洗手一样洗得干干净净。如果加强剂量就会把脸上的血色洗掉，让脸色像玫瑰般红润的美女变成苍白的幽灵。”

“你就是想用这种药剂来洗我的脸吧？”乔治亚娜焦急地问。

“哦，不，”丈夫急忙回答，“这只能作用于表面。你需要的是一种效力更加深入的药。”

艾尔默在同乔治亚娜谈话的时候，总是要仔细询问她的感觉，了解她被幽闭在这些房间里是否乐意，室内的气温是否适宜。这些问题显示出一种特殊的意味，以致乔治亚娜开始猜想自己业已受到了某种自然物质的影响，要不是把它同芬芳的香气一道吸了进去，就是把它同食物一道吃了下去。她还想象——不过也许只是幻想——自己体内有什么在躁动，有一种奇怪的、不可名状的感觉正偷偷传遍全身经脉，然后半带痛楚半带愉悦地在心窝战栗。任何时候只要她鼓起勇气照照镜子，就会看见自己的脸色像白玫瑰般苍白，那绯红的胎记仍然赫然印在脸颊上。现在即使是艾尔默也赶不上她自己对这个胎记的憎恶了。

在丈夫必须致力于化合与分析实验的时候，乔治亚娜为了消磨掉乏味的时光，便翻阅起他那间科学图书室里的书籍来。从许多幽昧难解的古书中，她读到一些充满传奇故事和诗歌的篇章。它们是中世纪自然哲学家的著作，这些人当中有艾伯塔斯·马格努斯(3)、科尼利乌斯·阿格里帕(4)、帕拉塞尔苏斯(5)，以及那位创造出会预言的青铜头像的著名修道士(6)。所有这些古代的自然科学家都站在自己时代的前列，却又充满了那些时代的某些轻信，所以人们相信——或者他们自己也认为——他们从对大自然的探索中获得了超越自然的力量，并从物理学中取得了对精神世界的支配权。王家学会的那些早期学报也同样离奇古怪、异想天开。学会会员们几乎丝毫不了解自然可能性的极限，只是不停地记录着种种奇迹，或者提出制造奇迹的方法。

对于乔治亚娜来说，最引发兴趣的是她丈夫亲笔写成的一卷对开本的大书，里面记载着他在科学研究生涯中的每一项实验，包括其原定目标、进展过程中所采用的种种方法、最终的成功或失败，以及导致成功或失败的详情细节。事实上，对于他那满怀热忱、雄心勃勃和富于幻想而又勇于实践、勤奋钻研的一生，这本书既是历史记录，也是一种象征。他处理起物质细节来如此专注，犹如除此之外别的什么都不存在，但他又将物质全部予以精神化，并凭借自己对无限的热切追求而避免陷入纯粹的物质主义。在他手中，实实在在的一块泥土也具备了某种灵魂。乔治亚娜一边读着，一边对艾尔默油然而生敬意，对他也比过去爱得更深，但对他的判断力却不再像以前那样绝对信赖了。尽管他取得了那么多成就，她却不能不看到他最辉煌的成就与他的理想目标相比几乎只能算作失败。如果与他不可企及的那些无价珍宝相比，他现在握在手中的最灿烂的钻石只能算是些最普通的卵石，而且他自己也是这样认为的。这部书里写满了为作者本人赢得盛誉的许多成就，然而又是一卷出自凡夫俗子之手的阴郁的记录。它记录下了人的悲哀自白和无穷尽的例证，证明人这种混合物其精神总是为肉体所拖累，并只能借助物质来发挥机能，也说明崇高的天性发现自身悲惨地受制于肉体时如何遭受绝望的袭击。也许任何领域中的每一个天才，都能从艾尔默的日记中看出自身经历的生动体现。

这些思绪深深地感动了乔治亚娜，她把脸伏在翻开的书页上，禁不住泪水涌流。就在这时候她被丈夫撞见了。

“读巫士的书是很危险的啊。”他笑着说，尽管表情有些不安和生气，“乔治亚娜，这本书里有些地方连我自己看上一眼都很难保持理智。小心别让它让你受害。”

“它使我比过去更加崇拜你了。”她说。

“啊，等到这次成功后再说吧，”他回答道，“到那时如果你乐意再来崇拜我吧。我也不会认为自己受之有愧了。好啦，我找你为的是要享受一下你的歌声。亲爱的，给我唱支歌吧。”

于是她便以自己行云流水般的歌声慰解了他精神上的饥渴。然后他便带着孩子般的无限欢悦离开了，他还向她保证说幽居生活很快就会结束，成功是有绝对把握的。他刚刚离开，乔治亚娜便感到有种无法抗拒的力量驱使自己跟着他。她忘了告诉艾尔默，过去两三个钟头里她身上出现了一种令她担忧的症状。它就是产生在那块致命胎记里的某种感觉，不是疼痛，而是引起了整个身体的焦躁不安。她急匆匆地跟在丈夫后面，第一次闯进了那间实验室。进入她眼帘的第一件东西就是那个熔炉，通红火热，光焰熊熊，从炉顶堆积的大量烟尘看来它已经不停地燃烧了许多年头。一套蒸馏器械正在全速运转。房间里到处是蒸馏器、试管、量筒、坩埚和其他种种用于化学研究的器具。一台电动机械已经准备停当正马上要投入使用。整个气氛显得极其压抑，空中弥漫着由实验产生的各种刺鼻的气味。整个房间十分简陋朴素，墙壁光秃秃的，地下铺着砖块，在习惯于自己闺房的华丽雅致的乔治亚娜看来，一切都显得异常陌生。但吸引了她的主要注意力，简直是全部注意力的，却是艾尔默的模样。

他脸色像死人似的苍白，神情急切而专注，全身紧俯在熔炉上方，仿佛熔炉里蒸馏出来的液体到底是永恒幸福之药还是永恒苦难之药，就全依赖于他的全神贯注。这与他为了鼓励乔治亚娜而表现出的那种乐观自信的神态是多么的不同啊！

“现在要当心，阿米那达勃；当心点，你这人形的机械！当心点，你这凡俗之徒！”艾尔默这样咕咕哝哝着，与其说是在训诫助手，倒不如说是在自言自语。“现在，只要有一念之差，就全都完了。”

“嗬！嗬！”阿米那达勃含糊地咕噜着，“瞧，主人！瞧！”

艾尔默急忙抬起头来，看到了乔治亚娜，他脸色先是变红，接着又变得比原来更加苍白。他冲到乔治亚娜身边，那样紧地一把抓住她的胳膊，甚至在她的胳膊上留下了自己的指印。

“你为什么到这里来？难道你不相信你的丈夫吗？”他情绪暴躁地叫道，“你想让那块该死的胎记毁灭我苦心经营的事情吗？药剂还没制成哩。走吧，好奇的女人！走！”

“不，艾尔默，”乔治亚娜的语气中显示出她所固有的坚定性格，“你并没有权力来抱怨我。你不相信自己的妻子，你一直掩藏着自己在这场实验中的焦虑心情。你不要认为我那么不中用，我的丈夫。把我们所冒的风险告诉我吧，不要担心我会畏缩；因为我在这件事里所担的风险要比你轻多了。”

“不，不，乔治亚娜！”艾尔默不耐烦地说，“不能这样。”

“我会顺从的，”她平静地回答道，“而且，艾尔默，无论你给我的是什么药剂，我都会一口吞下；根据同样的道理，就算是你亲手递给我一杯毒药我也会服下去的。”

“我心地高尚的妻子，”艾尔默被深深感动了，“直到现在我才知道你的天性是多么高贵和深沉。我再不会有任何事情瞒着你了。你要知道，这只绯红的手印尽管显得很表浅，实际上却以一种我从来未能想象到的力量牢牢楔入了你的机体中。我已经试用过种种无所不能的强效药剂，就只差改变你的生理组织了。现在只有一种办法还没有尝试过。要是这也不行，我们就全完了。”

“你为什么一直犹豫着不把这事告诉我？”她问道。

“因为，乔治亚娜，”艾尔默用低沉的声音说，“这样做有危险。”

“危险？危险只有一个——那就是让这个可怕的印记继续留在我的脸颊上！”乔治亚娜高声叫道，“去掉它，去掉它，不管要多大的代价，要不然我们都会被弄疯的！”

“上天知道，你说得真是太对了，”艾尔默哀伤地说，“现在，最亲爱的，回你的闺房去吧。再过片刻时间，一切都将接受检验了。”

他陪她回到房里，然后带着庄严而温柔的神情离开了她，这种神情远比他的言辞更能表明现在他们所面临的风险有多大。在他走后，乔治亚娜陷入了凝神沉思之中。她仔细思量着艾尔默的性格，做出了比以往任何时候都更全面公正的判断。她想到他那高贵的爱情，心里不禁无比欢悦却又阵阵战栗——他的爱是那么纯洁和崇高，绝不能接受哪怕半点的不完美，也不愿可怜地满足于任何不符合理想境界的凡俗平庸。她觉得这种感情远比那种低劣的爱情更加珍贵，远远胜过因为爱她的缘故而不得不忍受她的缺憾，远远胜过因为将完美理想降低到现实水准从而终生怀着背弃神圣爱情的负罪感。于是她以整个心灵虔诚祈祷，但愿自己能满足他那最崇高最深沉的观念，哪怕只有短短一瞬也好。她也十分清楚，不可能比短短一瞬更加长久，因为他的精神永远在奋进，永远在攀登，每一瞬都在要求着某种超越前一瞬的东西。

丈夫的脚步声把她惊醒了。他端着一只水晶高脚杯，里面盛的液体像水一样透明无色，但那莹莹光辉足以证明它真是一种长生之药。艾尔默脸色苍白；不过那似乎是心智高度亢奋和精神紧张的结果，而并非是害怕或怀疑的征象。

“这种药剂调制得可谓尽善尽美。”他说，以此来回答乔治亚娜询问的眼神，“它万无一失，除非我所有的科学知识都欺骗了我。”

“要不是为了你，亲爱的艾尔默，”他妻子说，“我宁愿以抛弃生命本身的方式来除掉这块凡人的胎记，而不愿用任何别的方式。对于达到像我现在这种精神境界的人来说，生命不过是一笔可悲的财富罢了。假如我更软弱一些和盲目一些，生活也许会是快乐的。假如我更坚强一些，生活也许还能怀抱着希望去加以忍受。可是，既然我发现自己是这样的人，我想我就是一切人当中最适合去死的人！”

“你最适合生活在天堂里而无须品尝死亡的滋味！”她丈夫回答道，“不过我们为什么要谈到死呢？这服药剂不可能失败。看看它对这株植物的作用吧。”

窗台上放着一盆患黄斑病的天竺葵，所有的叶片上都布满了黄色的斑点。艾尔默朝天竺葵下面的泥土里倒了很少一点药水。不一会儿，天竺葵的根部获得了药水的滋润，难看的黄斑渐渐消融进一片生机勃勃的翠绿之中。

“完全用不着什么来证明，”乔治亚娜平静地说，“把杯子给我吧，我很高兴把一切都交付于你的一句话。”

“那么，喝吧，崇高的女人！”艾尔默满怀炽热的赞赏高声说，“你的心灵纯洁无瑕，你敏感的肉体很快也将变得完美无缺了。”

她大口地喝下药水，然后把杯子交还到他手里。“真舒服，”她平静地笑了笑，“我觉得它好像是来自天堂的甘泉水，因为它里面蕴含着我所不了解的温和的芳香和甘美的滋味。它平息了许多日子以来一直煎熬着我的狂热的焦渴。现在，最亲爱的，让我睡去吧。我的肉体感觉正在把我的灵魂包裹起来，就像日落时分玫瑰花心周围的叶片一样。”

她说到最后几个字的时候已显示出些微的勉强，仿佛要发出那含糊拖沓的几个音节已经超出了她的控制力。话刚从唇间吐出，她便沉沉睡去了。艾尔默坐在她旁边，以那样急切的感情注视着她的面容，就好像他整个生命的价值都维系在即将显示的实验结果之上。然而与这种情绪交织在一起的，还有一位科学家富于哲理性的探究态度。哪怕是最细微的症状也逃不过他的目光。她脸颊上泛起的红潮，呼吸中的一次轻微失调，眼睑的一次微小颤动，几乎难以觉察的一阵全身战栗——随着时间一刻刻推移而出现的所有这些细节，他都记录在那册对开本的大书里。这本书前面的每一页中都留下了他紧张思考的印记，但漫长岁月中的所有思索都凝聚在这最后一页之中。

他一边忙着记录，同时也没有忘记随时观察那个不幸的手形胎记，每次都禁不住要打个寒战。然而有一次，由于某种奇怪的莫名冲动，他用嘴唇去吻它；而在吻它的时候，他的精神又感觉到畏缩。乔治亚娜在沉睡中不安地动了动，同时咕哝了一声，仿佛在表示抗议。艾尔默接着继续进行观察。他看出了效果。那只绯红的手印原来在乔治亚娜大理石般苍白的脸上是极其显著的，现在却变得轮廓模糊起来。她的脸色仍然和原来一样的苍白，可是那个胎记却随着她的每一次呼吸而变得不像原来那样清晰了。胎记的存在曾令人畏惧，而它的消失则更是令人恐惧。看一看虹霓的色彩是怎样在天空中消失的，你就会明白那个神秘的表记是怎样消退的了。

“天哪！它差不多消失了！”艾尔默自言自语道，狂喜之情难以自抑，“现在我几乎看不见它了。成功了！成功了！现在它只像最淡的玫瑰红。她的脸颊只要微微泛红就能掩盖住它。可是她却这么苍白！”

他拉开窗帘，让白日的自然光照进房间里，照在她的脸颊上。就在这时候，他听见了一阵粗野的、嘶哑的嬉笑声，他早已熟知那是他的仆人阿米那达勃表示欢乐的方式。

“啊，你这泥土胚子！啊，你这肉体凡胎！”艾尔默高喊道，疯狂似的大笑起来，“你给我干得挺好！物质与精神——尘世与天堂——这一次两方面都算尽职尽责！笑吧！你这感官动物！你赢得了笑的权利！”

这一阵大喊大叫惊醒了沉睡中的乔治亚娜。她慢慢睁开双眼，凝视着丈夫特地为此而准备的镜子。她发现那只曾经以灾难般的艳红灿然闪耀、几乎骇跑了他们全部幸福的绯红手印如今几乎无法察觉了，这时嘴角掠过了一丝淡淡的微笑。可是接着她又用蕴含忧愁和焦急的目光寻找着艾尔默的面孔，而艾尔默完全不能理解她何以会显示出这种神情。

“我可怜的艾尔默！”她喃喃地说。

“可怜？不，我是最富有、最快乐、最有福的！”他高喊道，“我举世无双的新娘啊，成功啦！你是完美无缺的！”

“我可怜的艾尔默，”她带着无比的柔情又重复了一遍，“你的志向远大，你的行为崇高。你因为怀有如此高尚纯洁的感情而弃绝了尘世所能给予你的最好的东西，请你别为此而懊悔。艾尔默，最亲爱的艾尔默，我快死了！”

唉！情况的确是这样！那只致命的手印紧握住生命的秘密，它乃是将天使般的精神与凡人的躯体融合为一体的纽带。随着那块胎记的最后一丝绯红色彩——那是人类缺陷的唯一标志——从她脸上渐渐消失，这位如今完美无瑕的女性便向空中呼出了最后一丝气息，而她的灵魂在丈夫身旁流连片刻之后，也就冉冉飞向了天国。接着，又听见了那阵嘶哑的嬉笑声！尘世凡俗的死亡命数，总是这样扬扬得意地战胜永恒不朽的精神，而精神则在这片半开发状态的朦胧领域中渴求着更高的完美。不过，假如艾尔默达到了更深刻的智慧境界，他倒也不必这样抛掷掉自己的幸福，因为人生幸福本可以将他那同属凡人机体的尘世生命与神圣超凡的素质相融合。他无法承受人世短暂的事物；他未能将目光投向时间阴影的范围之外，而且因为总是活在永恒之中，他也未能在当前生活中找到完美的未来。

拉帕西尼的女儿


很早以前，有一个名叫乔万尼·古瓦斯孔蒂的青年，从意大利南部地区来到帕多瓦(1)大学求学。乔万尼口袋里只有为数不多的几个金币，只好寄宿在一幢古旧大宅中一间又高又阴暗的房间里。这幢大宅看来曾经是某位帕多瓦贵族的府第，而事实上大门的确刻有一个家族的盾徽，只不过这个家族早已灭绝了。年轻的异乡人对自己祖国的伟大诗歌不无研究，回忆起这个家族有一位祖先，或许正是这座邸宅的主人呢，曾经被但丁描绘为地狱里的永恒受难者。(2)由于这些记忆和随之而生的联想，再加上初次远离故乡的年轻人天性易于感伤，不免使得乔万尼环顾着这陈设简陋、景象凄凉的房间，心情沉重地叹息起来。

“圣母啊，先生！”莉萨贝塔老太太叫了起来，她的心被年轻人英俊的相貌征服，正好心地竭力把屋子收拾得舒适宜人。“一个年轻人的心里怎么会发出这样的叹息？是觉得这座老宅太死气沉沉了吗？那么老天保佑，把头伸到窗户外面去吧，你就会看到跟你刚刚离开的那不勒斯(3)一样明亮的阳光哩。”

乔万尼按照老太太的劝告机械地把头探出窗外，却并不怎么同意她关于帕多瓦的阳光像意大利南部一样令人振奋的说法。不过尽管如此，阳光到底还是洒遍了窗户下的花园，把它哺育的恩泽普施在形形色色的花草之上，而这些花草看来都是经过精心培植和受到细心照料的。

“这座花园也是属于这幢房子的吗？”乔万尼问。

“但愿不是，先生，除非长的不是那些闲花野草，而是又肥又壮的盆栽蔬菜。”莉萨贝塔答道，“不是。花园是齐阿科莫·拉帕西尼先生亲手栽培的。这位大名鼎鼎的大夫，我敢说那不勒斯那么远的地方也都知道他。听人家说，他从这些花草中提炼出药来，效力就跟魔法一样灵验。你会时常看见医生老爷在工作，说不定还会瞧见小姐，也就是他的女儿，在花园里采摘那些奇花异草哩。”

老太太现在已经尽其所能地把屋子收拾好了，然后把年轻人交给神明去保佑，径自离开了。

乔万尼发现自己没有别的什么事好做，只有看看窗子下面的花园。从外观看，他判断这是帕多瓦早期的一类植物园，它的出现比意大利或世界上任何其他地方都要早。它也可能曾是某个名门望族的游乐园，因为在花园中央有座大理石喷泉的废墟，雕刻得精美绝伦，可惜已经坍塌毁损，在乱石堆积之中已无法追寻到它原有的格局。不过清泉仍然一如当年地喷涌着，在阳光下闪烁着欢悦的光彩。一阵轻柔的汩汩声传到了年轻人坐着的窗口，使他恍然觉得那口喷泉就像是一个不朽的精灵，永远不停地唱着自己的歌，毫不在意周围的沧桑变幻。而与此同时，一个世纪把它凝聚进了大理石雕刻中，而另一个世纪又摧毁了这易于朽坏的装饰，让它散落在大地上。泉水流入的水池周围长满了各种各样的植物，它们那些硕大的叶片需要大量水分来滋养，有些植物正繁花盛开、无比壮观。其中特别有一株灌木，长在水池中央的一个大理石花盆里，开满了紫红色的鲜花，每一朵都闪烁着宝石般的富丽光彩。整丛灌木是如此绚烂辉煌，仿佛没有阳光也能把整个花园照亮。地上的每一处都长满了花木和药草，它们即使赶不上那丛灌木的娇美，也都显示出辛勤照料的迹象，似乎每株花草都各有自身的价值，培植它们的科学家对此无不谙熟于心。有的植物栽在雕满古雅花饰的石缸里，有的种在普通花盆中，有的像蛇一样在地上蜿蜒，或者不管攀缘着什么就向上高高伸展。有一株植物则缠绕在一尊威耳廷努斯(4)雕像上，将它荫翳包裹在飘拂悬垂的叶丛中，这种景象是如此令人愉悦，真可以成为雕刻家潜心体味的对象了。

就在乔万尼伫立窗前之时，他忽然听见一排绿叶后面传来沙沙的响声，这才察觉到花园里有人在干活儿。这个人很快就进入了他的眼帘，看样子绝不是一个普通的园丁，而是一位身材很高、形容枯槁、身穿学者黑长袍的人。他的岁数已过中年，长着灰白的头发和稀疏的灰白胡须，眉宇间透出异乎常人的智慧与教养，不过即使是在风华正茂之年，这张脸上恐怕也绝不会显露出多少内心的热情。

这位园艺学家无比专注地审视着路边的每一株花草，似乎他正在穿透它们最深秘处的天性，观察着它们的创造性本质，探知着这一片叶子何以是这种形状，而那一片叶子又何以是另一种形状，为什么这些不同的花朵在色泽和香味上会如此迥然相异。然而，他尽管对这些草木的生命有深刻的理解，却绝不试图与它们亲近。与此相反，他避免接触到它们或者直接吸入它们的气味，那种小心翼翼的态度令乔万尼感到很不愉快，因为他那副神态举止就像在邪恶势力包围之中行走的人，周围仿佛全是猛兽、毒蛇或者妖魔鬼怪，稍有疏忽就会遭到灭顶之灾。这位年轻人看见一个养花人居然是这一副战战兢兢的神情，心中不禁奇怪地升起恐骇之感：园艺本来是人类劳作中最朴素最纯洁的，也是人类未曾堕落的双亲所享有的欢乐与劳动啊。(5)难道这座花园就是当今世界的伊甸园？这个人，对自己亲手种植的东西都唯恐受其危害，难道就是亚当？

那个疑虑重重的园艺师在摘除枯死的树叶和修剪长势过盛的灌木时，都戴着一双厚手套保护着双手。这并非是他唯一的甲冑。当他穿过花园，来到大理石喷泉边那株长满珍宝般紫花的美丽植物跟前时，还戴上一种面罩来遮蔽嘴和鼻孔，仿佛这株植物所有的美都只是掩藏着某种致命的剧毒。就这样他还觉得太危险，又退了回去，摘下面罩，高声呼唤起来，那虚弱的声音就像是个内脏患病的人。

“贝阿特丽丝！贝阿特丽丝！”

“我在这儿，爸爸。你要什么？”对面房子的窗户里传来了圆润而年轻的声音——圆润得像热带的落日，令乔万尼莫名其妙地联想起姹紫嫣红的色彩和芬芳馥郁的香气。“你是在花园里吗？”

“是的，贝阿特丽丝，”园艺师回答道，“我需要你的帮助。”

在石雕门下很快出现了一个年轻姑娘的身影，她就像灿烂的春花和初升的旭日一样丰美，其姿容简直到了无可挑剔的地步。她浑身洋溢着青春的健美和生命力，而这一切又仿佛被她那条处女的腰带紧紧拘束着。不过乔万尼在朝园中俯视时，禁不住有点感到毛骨悚然，因为这位美丽的陌生女郎使他觉得仿佛就是园中的另一朵花，是园中那些花朵的人类姐妹，虽然同它们一样美丽，甚至比它们当中最艳丽的还要美丽，但也只有戴着手套才能触摸，不戴上面罩也不能接近。贝阿特丽丝沿着园中小径走过来，乔万尼观察到她在抚摸和闻嗅着一些花草，而那些正是她父亲小心翼翼回避的东西。

“到这里来，贝阿特丽丝，”父亲说，“来看看我们的头号宝贝还需要给予多少照料。可是我已经年迈体弱了，要是依照情况需要去过分接近它是会送掉我的老命的。所以，这株树恐怕必须由你一个人来照管了。”

“我很乐意照料它。”姑娘用圆润的嗓音回答道，一面朝那株艳丽的植物弯下腰来，张开双臂，似乎想要拥抱它。“是的，我的妹妹，我的宝贝，培育你、伺候你将是贝阿特丽丝的工作；而你将以自己的亲吻与芬芳的气息来回报她，这对于她来说就好比是生命的呼吸。”

接着，她便带着与她柔情的话语同样的温柔态度忙开来，给予那株树以它所需要的全部细心呵护。乔万尼站在高高的窗子后面揉着眼睛，几乎要怀疑这究竟是一位姑娘在照料她心爱的花呢，还是一位姐姐在对她的妹妹尽着爱的责任。这番景象很快就结束了。也许是拉帕西尼医生干完了园中的工作，或者是他警觉的目光瞥见了陌生人的面孔，他挽着女儿的手臂离开了。夜色渐浓；花草似乎散发出浓郁逼人的香味，悄然升腾，掠过打开的窗户。乔万尼关上窗子，躺到卧榻上，随即梦见一朵艳丽的鲜花和一位美丽的姑娘。鲜花和姑娘并非一物，却又相同，两者的形态中都充满某种诡异的危险。

不过晨光能发挥一种影响，可以纠正我们想象中的甚至判断上的错误，这些错误往往发生在夕阳西下、夜色迷离或者月光朦胧的时候。乔万尼醒来后的第一个动作就是猛地打开窗户，低头凝视那个给他带来神秘梦境的花园。他惊奇地，同时又略带羞愧地发现那个花园是个实实在在、平凡无奇的东西。清晨第一缕阳光正在给鲜花绿叶上的露珠镀上一层金色，让奇花异卉显得更加明丽动人，但眼前的一切毕竟都并未超越日常经验的限度。年轻人不禁感到高兴，因为在这座荒凉城市的中心，自己竟能获得俯瞰这花草繁茂、景象迷人的花园的机会。他暗自对自己说，这个花园将成为自己与大自然交流的一种象征性语言。这时候，还看不到那位形容憔悴、满面忧思的拉帕西尼医生和他那光彩照人的女儿，所以乔万尼难以确定自己觉得他们举止怪异根据何在：到底是因为他们本身如此呢，还是自己想入非非的结果。不过他打算对整个事情保持最理智的态度。

当天，他带着一封介绍信去拜会皮埃特罗·巴格里奥尼先生，他是大学里的一位医学教授，也是一位声名卓著的医生。教授虽已年迈，态度却非常和蔼，甚至可以说具有快乐的天性。他留下乔万尼一起吃饭，他不拘礼仪、谈笑风生，尤其是在喝下两杯托斯卡纳葡萄酒(6)之后，更使得乔万尼感觉非常愉快。乔万尼心想在同一个城市居住的科学家们彼此一定很熟悉，便抓住一个机会提到拉帕西尼医生的名字。可是教授的反应并不如他所预期的那样热诚。

“作为一个从事神圣医学的教师，”巴格里奥尼教授回答乔万尼提出的一个问题，“对拉帕西尼这样的技艺卓绝的医生不给予恰当的和慎重的赞扬，是不合适的；但另一方面，假如我听任一个像你这样前程远大的青年，乔万尼先生，而且是我老朋友的儿子，对将来可能将你的生死握在手心的人抱着错误的认识，那我的回答又会对不起自己的良心。实话实说吧，我们这位可敬的拉帕西尼医生的科学造诣，可以同帕多瓦大学或者全意大利的任何大学教授媲美——或许只有一个人除外。不过对他的职业道德，人们却持有严重的异议。”

“是些什么异议呢？”年轻人问。

“我的朋友乔万尼是不是身体或者心灵出了毛病，才这么热衷于打听医生们的事情？”教授微笑着说，“至于拉帕西尼，据说是——我对他很熟悉，可以担保其真实性——他对科学的关心远远胜过对人类的关心。他对病人的兴趣仅仅是把他们当作某种新奇实验的对象。只要能给他巨大的知识积累再增添哪怕一粒芥子，他情愿牺牲人的生命，包括他自己的生命，或者任何他最亲爱的人的生命。”

“我觉得他真是个可怕的人。”乔万尼说，一面回想着拉帕西尼那副冰冷的、纯理智的面容，“不过，尊敬的教授，那难道不是一种高贵的精神吗？能够对科学怀着如此超凡热忱的人并不太多吧？”

“但愿这种人不要太多。”教授回答道，神情有些恼怒，“至少，除非他们对医学的观点比拉帕西尼更健全。他的理论认为，医药的一切疗效都存在于我们称之为毒性植物的东西里。他亲手培育这些毒性植物，据说甚至提炼出了一些新型毒素，其毒性比天然毒素可怕得多，倘若这位博学之士不帮忙的话，恐怕早就让全世界遭了灾祸。不容否认，医生先生手里的这些危险物质所造成的危害比预料的要小。必须承认，有时候他的治疗效果的确奇妙，或者说似乎很奇妙。不过我给你说心里话，乔万尼先生，他的这些成功不应该受到赞扬——有可能是运气使然——而他对于自己的失败却负有不可推卸的责任，平心而论，失败倒可能是他亲手造成的。”

倘若年轻人知道教授与拉帕西尼医生之间在专业方面一直存在冲突，而人们一般认为后者占据着上风，那么他对巴格里奥尼的意见就会持相当保留的态度了。如果有读者愿意自己做判断的话，不妨去查阅帕多瓦大学医学系保存的双方论战的黑体铅字文件。

“博学的教授，我不了解，”乔万尼对刚才所谈的拉帕西尼对科学的专注热忱做了一番沉思之后，接着说——“我不了解这位医生对自己的医学到底有多么钟爱，不过，对他来说肯定还有比医学更珍贵的东西。他有个女儿。”

“啊哈！”教授大笑着叫道，“现在我们的朋友乔万尼可暴露了他的秘密。你也听说他的这个女儿了，帕多瓦城所有的年轻人都在为她疯狂，虽然没有几个能有幸一睹她的芳容。我对这位贝阿特丽丝小姐一无所知，只听说拉帕西尼把自己高深的医学知识都传授给了她，她不仅因年轻美丽而享有盛誉，而且有资格担任教授的职位。或许她父亲就想让她来占据我的职位吧！荒诞的传闻还有的是，但不值一提也不值一听。好啦，乔万尼先生，喝干你杯中的葡萄酒吧。”

因为喝酒过多的缘故，古瓦斯孔蒂回去的时候颇有醉意，满脑袋漂浮着有关拉帕西尼医生和美丽的贝阿特丽丝的奇异幻想。在回家路上碰巧经过一家花店，他买了一束鲜花。

他上楼回到房间里，靠窗坐下，但隐藏在高高的墙壁投下的阴影里，这样就可以俯瞰花园而没有被人发现的危险。在他目光的扫视下，整个花园是一派寂寞景象。珍奇的花木沐浴着阳光，不时地彼此轻轻点头，仿佛在互认亲缘、互通情意。花园中央那倾颓的喷泉旁，长着那株绚丽的灌木，浑身缀满了珍宝般的紫色花朵。繁花朵朵在空中光彩闪耀，倒映在水池中又被折射回来，在层层光影映照之中流光溢彩。正像我们已经讲过的，花园里起初是一片寂寞景象。不过没过多久——乔万尼一半盼望一半害怕的事情发生了——一个人影出现在古老的石雕拱门下，穿过一排排花木走过来，一面深深呼吸着花木的种种异香，仿佛是古代传说中靠香气生活的精灵。年轻人再次看到贝阿特丽丝，惊奇地发现她的美丽超过了自己记忆中的形象；她是如此艳丽，如此充满活力，在阳光辉耀下简直是光艳照人。乔万尼不禁悄声自语说，她的光彩一定把花园小径上那些阴暗处也照亮了。这一次能把她的容貌看得比上次更清楚，那张脸上纯朴而甜美的表情使乔万尼惊愕不已——他还从没有想过她具有这样的性格，于是他再次问自己：她会是怎样的人？他也再次观察到或者想象着，这位美丽的姑娘同奇花悬垂于喷泉之上的那株美艳的灌木十分相似——贝阿特丽丝似乎也陶醉于这种幻想，她的服装配搭和色彩的选择使这种相似性更加强烈。

她走近那株灌木，带着炽热的激情张开双臂，将它的枝条亲密地拥进怀抱——亲密得把自己的脸掩没在它繁茂的叶丛中，把自己亮泽的卷发交织到了花朵里。

“请你将芳香的呼吸给我吧，我的妹妹，”贝阿特丽丝叫道，“因为我嗅着普通的空气就发晕。请你将这朵花给我吧，我会从茎干上轻轻地摘下它，放在紧贴心口的地方。”

拉帕西尼那美丽的女儿一边说着，一边从灌木上摘下了一朵最鲜艳的花，准备把它别在胸前。可就在此时，除非是乔万尼的醉意让他产生了错觉，眼前发生了一件奇怪的事。一条橙色的小爬虫，大概属于蜥蜴或者变色龙之类，碰巧沿着小径爬行着，正好到了贝阿特丽丝脚边。乔万尼似乎看到——不过他观看的地点隔着一段距离，也许并不能看清楚那个小家伙——不过他总觉得折断的花茎上滴落了一两滴汁液，正好落在那条蜥蜴头上。顿时，小爬虫的身子剧烈地扭动起来，接着就躺在阳光下一动不动了。贝阿特丽丝也观察到了这个异常现象，她悲伤地画了个十字，但并不显得惊诧；她仍然把那朵致命的花朵别在胸前，并不因此有半点犹疑。花朵在她胸前盛开着，闪耀着宝石般的炫目光彩，给她的服装和容貌增添了世间任何东西都不可能给予的恰如其分的魅力。乔万尼已经从窗前的阴影里走出来，他把身子往前探看一下又退缩回去，浑身战抖着，低声自言自语。

“我是醒着的吧？我的神志是清楚的吧？”他问自己，“这是什么人？我该说她美丽呢，还是该说她极其可怕呢？”

贝阿特丽丝这时正信步穿过花园，走到了乔万尼窗下。为了满足自己被她激起的强烈而痛苦的好奇心，乔万尼不能自抑地把头从藏身处伸了出去。就在此刻，一只美丽的昆虫越过花园的围墙飞来：也许它已在全城漫游了一番，在古城的人类聚居地找不到鲜花和绿树，直到拉帕西尼医生园子里花草的浓香把它从远处引诱过来。这只长翅膀的快活小虫并没有停在鲜花上，它似乎被贝阿特丽丝吸引住了，在空中徘徊不定，绕着她的头顶振翅飞翔着。这一次发生的事算是千真万确了，除非乔万尼·古瓦斯孔蒂的眼睛欺骗了他。即便可能如此吧，他还是恍惚看到就在贝阿特丽丝带着孩子般的欣喜凝视着这只小昆虫时，它渐渐堕入昏晕，跌落在她的脚下；它那对闪光的翅膀战抖着，然后死去——他找不出任何致死的原因，除了姑娘所呼出的气息而外。贝阿特丽丝俯身看着那只死昆虫，又一次画了个十字，发出了深长的叹息声。

乔万尼情不自禁地动了动，使她把目光投向了窗户。她看到一个漂亮的青年男子——与其说他是个意大利人，倒不如说更像希腊人，面容匀称俊美，一头卷发闪耀着金色亮光——他正俯视着她，就像翱翔在半空中的精灵。乔万尼不由自主地把手中一直握着的花束向下抛去。

“小姐，”他说，“这是些纯洁而有益于健康的鲜花，请为乔万尼·古瓦斯孔蒂而佩戴吧。”

“谢谢，先生。”贝阿特丽丝用圆润的声音回答道，就像涌来一阵悦耳的乐音，她脸上也浮现出半带儿童稚气半带女性娇媚的欢乐表情。“我接受您的礼物，并愿以这朵珍贵的紫花作为回报。不过我要是往上扔的话，够不着您站的地方，所以乔万尼先生只好满足于我的谢意了。”

她把花束从地上捡起来，接着仿佛因为逾越了少女的审慎、回应了陌生人的敬意而内心羞愧，迅速地转身穿过花园回去了。可是尽管这瞬刻极为短暂，乔万尼似乎发现就在她快要在石雕拱门下消失的时候，那束美丽的鲜花已开始在她手中枯萎了。这个想法简直毫无根据；隔着这么远的距离，是绝不可能把枯萎的花和鲜花分清的。

这件事之后的许多天里，年轻人都尽量避开那扇俯瞰拉帕西尼家花园的窗户，好像只要他情不自禁地往那里瞟上一眼，就会有某种丑陋而可怕的东西把自己的眼睛弄瞎。他心里明白，自己因为同贝阿特丽丝谈过话，在某种程度上已经被一种不可言喻的力量影响。如果说他的心灵业已处于某种真实的危险中，那么最明智的对策是立刻离开自己的住所和帕多瓦城。较为明智的办法则是尽量使自己习惯于以随意的和理智的态度去看待贝阿特丽丝——这样就会将她严格有序地逐渐纳入普通经验的范围。最不好的做法是，虽然乔万尼避免见到她，却仍然住在与这个奇异的姑娘相距咫尺之地，彼此紧密相邻甚至有发生交往的可能性，这将给他那狂乱想象所不断产生的荒谬幻想赋予一种实在性和真实感。乔万尼的内心感情并不深沉——或者至少其深度至今尚未经过测量。不过他的想象力很敏锐，又有南方人的热烈性格，任何时刻都可能升至炽热的顶峰。不论贝阿特丽丝是否具有那些可怕的特性，那种乔万尼亲眼所见的致命气息，以及她与那些美丽的剧毒花朵之间的亲和力，至少她已经把一种猛烈而微妙的毒素注入了他的机体。那并不是爱情，尽管她的丰美娇艳使他十分迷恋；那也不是恐怖，即使他想象她的灵魂也浸透了那种充溢于她身体的毒素。它是以爱情和恐怖为父母的野生后裔，既像爱情一样燃烧，又像恐怖一样战栗。乔万尼不知道该恐惧什么，更不知道该希望什么；然而希望和恐惧在他胸中不停地争斗着，彼此交替地征服对方，被打败的又再跳起来重新搏斗。一切单纯的情感是值得祝福的，不论它们属于黑暗还是光明！正是黑暗与光明的可怕混合才产生出地狱的炫目火焰。

为了平息精神上的狂热，他常常在帕多瓦的街道上疾走，或者跑到城门外去；脚步追随着思想激烈搏动的节奏，往往越走越快，犹如狂奔一样。有一天，他忽然发现自己受到了阻拦，一个身材魁梧的老人抓住了他的胳膊；那个人认出了这个年轻人，便回头迫来，为了赶上他而弄得气喘吁吁。

“乔万尼先生！停下，我的年轻朋友！”他叫喊道，“你忘记我了吗？要是我的变化也像你这么大，倒也真会被人忘记啦。”

原来是巴格里奥尼。乔万尼从第一次见面之后就一直躲着他，害怕教授的睿智会洞察自己心底的秘密。他极力恢复镇静，用狂乱的眼神从内心世界瞪视着身外的世界，说起话来就像一个梦游人一样。

“是呀，我是乔万尼·古瓦斯孔蒂。您是皮埃特罗·巴格里奥尼教授。现在让我过去！”

“还不行，还不行，乔万尼·古瓦斯孔蒂先生。”教授微笑着说，同时用热切的目光仔细审视着这位年轻人，“什么！难道我和你父亲不是一块儿长大的吗？在帕多瓦城的古老街道上，他的儿子与我就像陌生人一样擦身而过吗？站着别动，乔万尼先生；我们分手前我有几句话要说。”

“那就快说，最尊敬的教授，快说。”乔万尼焦躁得发火，“阁下没有看出我有急事吗？”

正在他说话的时候，沿街走过来一个穿黑衣的人，佝偻着腰，脚步虚浮，似乎体质十分羸弱。他面带病容，脸色枯黄，神情中却饱含敏锐而活跃的智慧，以至一个旁观者很容易忽视他的病弱之躯，而只看到他洋溢着奇妙的精力。这个人经过他们身边时，同巴格里奥尼只是冷淡而疏远地互致问候，却以专注的目光凝视乔万尼，仿佛要把他内心所有值得注意的东西都弄个水落石出。然而那目光中又含有一种特别的宁静，似乎对于这个青年作为一个人并不在意，而只是沉浸于一种科学思辨的兴趣中。

“那就是拉帕西尼医生！”教授在陌生人走过之后低声说道，“他以前见过你吗？”

“我不知道。”乔万尼回答说，他听见那个名字便悚然一惊。

“他见过你！他一定见过你！”巴格里奥尼急匆匆地说，“出于这种或那种目的，这位科学家正在研究你。我了解他的那种目光！那目光和他弯腰观看一只鸟、老鼠或者蝴蝶时脸上罩着的冷光一模一样；那些小动物都是他在进行某种实验时使用花香薰死的。他的那种神情就像大自然本身那样深不可测，却没有大自然的爱的温暖。乔万尼先生，我愿意用自己的生命来打赌，你已经成为拉帕西尼一项实验的对象了！”

“你把我当成傻瓜了吧？”乔万尼激动地叫了起来，“教授先生，你这么搞可是一场不适当的实验。”

“别着急！别着急！”沉着的教授回答说，“听我告诉你，可怜的乔万尼，拉帕西尼对你发生了科学兴趣，你已经落进可怕的魔掌了！而贝阿特丽丝小姐——她在这出神秘剧中扮演了什么角色？”

可是乔万尼觉得巴格里奥尼的固执简直不堪忍受，便猛然脱逃而去，教授要想抓住他已经来不及了。他目不转睛地望着年轻人的背影，不停地摇头。

“这样可不行，”巴格里奥尼自语道，“这个年轻人是我老朋友的儿子，不能让他受到任何伤害，而医学的奥秘是能够保护他的。何况拉帕西尼要从我手里夺走这个孩子，利用他去做那些魔鬼般的实验，在我看来也的确是欺人太甚了。他竟然有这么个女儿！这件事我得操操心。说不定，最博学的拉帕西尼，你做梦也想不到我可能让你的如意算盘化为泡影哩！”

这时候，乔万尼东拐西绕地跑了一大圈，总算回到了寓所的门口。他在进门时碰到了老莉萨贝塔，她满脸堆笑，显然是想引起他的注意，然而并无效果，因为乔万尼激动的感情已经消退为冰冷而迟钝的一片空无。他回过头来盯着那张挤满笑容的皱巴巴的面孔，却似乎茫然而无所见。于是老太婆只好紧紧抓住他的外氅。

“先生！先生！”她悄声喊道，脸上仍然堆满笑容，看上去就像一副因年代久远而变得乌黑的怪异的木雕面具，“听着，先生！有一道秘密的通道可以进入那座花园！”

“你说什么？”乔万尼叫起来，同时飞快地转过身，仿佛一个没有生命的东西猛然变得生机勃发，“有一道秘密通道进入拉帕西尼医生的花园？”

“嘘！嘘！别这么大声！”莉萨贝塔悄声说，一面用手捂住乔万尼的嘴，“是的；能进尊敬的医生家的花园，你在那儿能看到他的全部奇花异草。帕多瓦城有许多年轻人愿意掏出金子，只要能进去观赏观赏那些花儿。”

乔万尼把一块金币放进了她的手里。

“带路吧。”他说。

大概是受到了巴格里奥尼谈话的刺激，他心头掠过了一丝疑云，也许老莉萨贝塔的介入与某个阴谋有关系，无论这个阴谋的性质是什么，据那位教授的猜测，总之拉帕西尼医生正打算把他网罗进去。不过这丝疑虑尽管使乔万尼感到不安，却不足以阻止他。就在他知道有机会接近贝阿特丽丝的那一刻，他就觉得这么做乃是自己生命的绝对需要。她是天使还是魔鬼都无关紧要；他已无可挽回地陷身于她的影响范围之中，只能服从它的律法被席卷而去，被裹入愈来愈小的旋涡之中，趋向某个他目前还不打算去预测的结局。然而说来奇怪，他突然间又怀疑自己这种强烈兴趣是不是虚幻的妄想？自己的感情是否真有那么深沉和明确，足以让自己投入这个难以预测的处境？它是否仅仅属于年轻人一时的幻想，与心灵并无深刻联系或者根本就与心灵毫无关系？

他停下脚步，犹豫不决，并侧身往回转，但接着又继续朝前走去。那个干瘪的老太婆引着他经过几条阴暗的过道，最后打开了一道门，门一打开，但见满目青翠，树叶沙沙作响，斑驳的阳光在枝叶间闪烁。乔万尼朝前走去，挤过阻挡着隐秘入口的一丛藤蔓缠绕的灌木，正好来到了他自己的窗下，站在拉帕西尼医生花园的空地上。

这样的情况常常发生，当不可能的事情在眼前出现，梦幻的迷雾凝聚成可触可感的现实时，我们却发现自己心情平静甚至冷静自若，而这种情况本来是我们苦苦期待、应该使我们欣喜若狂的。命运就是喜欢这样捉弄人。激情乃是不速之客，总是猛然间不期而至，可是当机缘成熟需要它登场时，它却懒洋洋地在后面拖拖沓沓。乔万尼现在的情况就是如此。日复一日，只要他一想到和贝阿特丽丝见面，和她在这花园中面对面地站在一起，沐浴在她那旭日般美丽的光彩中，从她的凝视中获取自己的生命之谜，这不可能实现的念头就会使他血脉贲张、心跳加剧。然而在此刻，他的心情却奇怪而不合时宜地平静如水。他迅速地朝四周一瞥，想看看贝阿特丽丝或者她父亲在不在这里，结果发现园中只有他自己，便开始挑剔地观察起那些植物来。

这些花草的模样都不能让他感到满意。它们的那种艳丽显得粗暴，过分热烈，甚至不自然。要是一个漫游者在森林里迷了路，见到这些树木都会吓得心惊肉跳，因为它们每一株的模样都是那么狂野，仿佛是从乱木丛中探出一张鬼脸，向着他瞪眼狞视。有几株还会让神经脆弱的人大受惊骇，因为那种违背自然的模样说明它们是由不同品种杂交而成，并不是上帝创造的产物，而是人类堕落幻想的恶魔后裔，正扬扬自得地对美加以邪恶的嘲笑。它们大概都是园艺实验的结果，其中有一两株是用本身十分可爱的植物混杂而成的，那种令人疑虑的不祥特征鲜明地体现出整座花园的品格。最后，乔万尼在所有的花木中辨认出了两三种，那都是他所熟知的毒性植物。正在凝神思考的时候，他听见了丝绸衣裙沙沙作响的声音，他转过脸来，看见贝阿特丽丝出现在石雕拱门的下面。

乔万尼来不及考虑自己该怎样应付这个局面，是为自己擅自闯入花园道歉呢，还是假定自己的到来即使不合乎拉帕西尼医生或他女儿的意愿，至少也获得了他们的默许。不过贝阿特丽丝的神情使他放了心，尽管关于自己通过什么办法进入花园的问题仍然使他有些惴惴不安。贝阿特丽丝轻盈地沿着小径走来，和他在那座倾颓的喷泉边相遇。她显出诧异的表情，但满脸焕发着单纯而和蔼的快乐神气。

“您是一位鉴赏鲜花的行家，先生。”贝阿特丽丝微微一笑说，她在暗指乔万尼从窗口向她抛下花束的事，“所以难怪您看见我父亲的奇花异卉，就被吸引得非来就近观赏不可。要是他在这儿，会告诉您有关这些花草习性的许多新奇而有趣的事情；他在这种研究中耗费了毕生精力，这座花园就是他的世界。”

“还有您本人，小姐，”乔万尼说，“假如名实相符的话——您也同样精通这些鲜花和这些芳香所显示的功效。要是您肯屈尊赐教，我一定会比受拉帕西尼先生教诲还要学得好些。”

“竟会有这种毫无根据的谣传？”贝阿特丽丝问道，并发出音乐般动听的笑声，“人们说我精通父亲的植物学！真是开玩笑！不；尽管我是在这些花草中长大的，但我所知的只不过是它们的色泽和香味。有时候我觉得自己甚至连这点儿知识也想丢掉。这儿有许多花，它们并不是不艳丽，但我一见到它们就害怕和讨厌。不过，先生，请别相信那些关于我学识的传言。关于我的情况，除了你亲眼所见之外什么也不要相信。”

“我亲眼所见的就应该都相信吗？”乔万尼隐有所指地问道，想起过去所见的那几幕情景不免使他感到畏缩，“不，小姐；您对我的要求未免太少。您应当吩咐我除了您说的话之外什么也不要相信才对。”

看来贝阿特丽丝懂得了他的意思。她的双颊泛起了一道红霞；但她正视着乔万尼的眼睛，以女王般的高傲回应他那隐含不安的猜疑的目光。

“那我就吩咐您，先生，”她回答道，“忘掉一切您可能怀有的对我的幻想。即使外部感官觉得真实的，本质上仍然可能虚假。不过贝阿特丽丝说出的话字字都真正发自内心深处。对此你可以相信。”

她的整个脸庞上浮起了一道红晕，就像真理本身的光辉一样照亮了乔万尼的意识；但是在她说话的时候四周空气中又弥漫着一阵芳香，是那样浓郁甜美，尽管稍纵即逝，年轻人却出于难以名状的抗拒心理，几乎不敢往肺里吸。它可能是花的香气。或许，那也可能是贝阿特丽丝的呼吸，就仿佛她用心灵的芬芳熏透了她的话语，因此使它们带上了奇异的芳香？乔万尼心中就像掠过一道阴影似的发生了一阵晕眩，但很快就过去了；他似乎透过这位美丽姑娘的双眼看到了她那透明灵魂的深处，于是不再有怀疑或恐惧了。

笼罩着贝阿特丽丝神情的那种激情色彩消退了；她变得快乐起来，就像是一个独居孤岛的少女能与来自文明世界的旅人交谈一样，她因为能与这位年轻人谈话而感到十分欣喜。显然，她的全部生活经验都局限在这座花园的范围之内。她一会儿谈论阳光或者夏季云彩之类的简单事物，一会儿又询问城市的情况，乔万尼远方的家、他的朋友、母亲、姐妹，等等——这些问题表明她是如此与世隔绝，对于生活的方式和形态是如此一无所知，以至乔万尼就像在对一个幼稚的孩子说话。在他面前，她的灵魂就像一道清泉涌流而出，才刚刚瞥见第一缕阳光，对于映射在自己怀中的大地与天空的影像感到莫名惊异。从那深深的泉源里也涌流出种种思想和五光十色的奇异想象，犹如钻石和红玉随着喷泉的水珠向上闪耀跳跃。年轻人心中不时感觉到惊异，没想到自己现在竟能同这位让他日夜梦想的人并肩散步；自己对于她曾在想象中怀着种种恐惧，自己曾亲眼见过她显示那些可怕的禀赋——而现在却像兄弟一样与贝阿特丽丝亲切交谈，并发现她是如此充满人情味，如此富于少女的美。然而这些想法不过转瞬即逝；她的性格的力量太具有真实性了，很快就使人感到亲近无拘。

他们就这样随意地交谈着，信步穿过花园，经过条条小径的道道拐角，来到那个坍塌的喷泉边。喷泉边上就生长着那株壮观的灌木，繁花竞相开放，光彩灿烂。灌木正散发着阵阵芬芳，乔万尼觉得这种香气和他所认为的贝阿特丽丝呼吸的气息完全一样，只不过更是无比的浓烈。就在她看到这棵树的时候，乔万尼发现她按住了胸口，仿佛她的心突然痛苦地狂跳起来。

“一生中这是第一次，”她喃喃地对那株树说，“我把你给忘了。”

“我还记得，小姐，”乔万尼说，“您曾经许诺过要送我一朵这宝石般的鲜花，回报我曾快乐地斗胆抛在您脚下的花束。现在请允许我摘下一朵来，作为这次会见的纪念吧。”

他朝那株灌木走了一步，把手伸了出去；可是贝阿特丽丝猛地冲上前，同时发出了一声尖叫，就像利刃一样穿透了他的心。她抓住他的手，用她纤弱身体的全部力量把它拉了回来。乔万尼觉得她的手的触摸使他周身的神经都在战栗。

“不要碰它！”她用痛苦的声音喊道，“要活命就别去碰它！它会弄死人的！”

接着，她掩着脸跑开了，消失在石雕拱门下面。就在乔万尼目送她的背影时，他发现了拉帕西尼消瘦的身影和苍白而聪慧的脸孔，他一直站在园门的阴影中观察着这一幕，不知已有多长时间了。

乔万尼一回到自己的寓所，就满怀热情地回想着贝阿特丽丝的倩影，从他第一次见到她起，她的形象就一直笼罩着魔幻色彩，现在又浸透了少女的娇柔温情。她富于人情味，她的天性中充满了温柔的女性气质，她值得自己倾心崇拜，她的心灵肯定能升华到爱情的顶峰和崇高境界。曾被他一度视为她生理和道德上可怕癖性的那些迹象，现今不是忘得干干净净，就是被感情的难以捉摸的诡辩术转化成了魅力无穷的金冠，使得贝阿特丽丝越发显得特出不凡、值得赞赏。任何看上去丑陋的东西如今都变得美丽了；或者说，即使不能发生变化，也偷偷潜藏到那些朦胧不清的念头之中，而那些念头则拥塞在我们健全的意识之光照射不到的阴暗区域里。他就这样度过了那个不眠之夜，直到晨曦唤醒了拉帕西尼医生花园中沉睡的花朵，他才进入梦乡，而乔万尼的梦境无疑也把他带进了那座花园里。朝阳按时升起，把光芒投射到年轻人的眼帘上，使他醒来并感觉到某种痛楚。当他完全清醒过来的时候，才意识到手上有一股火辣辣的刺痛——在右手上——正是他想要去摘一朵宝石般的鲜花时贝阿特丽丝抓住的那只手。手背上如今留有一个紫色的印迹，像四只纤小手指的指印，而腕部留下的痕迹则像细长的大拇指的指印。

啊，爱情是多么的顽固——甚至连在想象中滋生、在心灵中毫无根基的爱情的狡诈假冒品也是如此——它总是冥顽地固执己见，直到它命中注定地烟消云散为止！乔万尼把一条手巾包裹在右手上，心中纳闷自己被什么毒虫子蜇着了，很快就又坠入对贝阿特丽丝的梦想中，浑然忘却了疼痛。

有了第一次会面，第二次便按照我们称之为命运的必然进程发生了。接着有第三次，第四次。同贝阿特丽丝在花园中相见已不再是乔万尼日常生活中的插曲，而可以说是成了他生活的全部内容，因为对那销魂时刻的期待与回忆也把他其余的时间全部占据了。拉帕西尼的女儿也同样如此。她守候着年轻人露面，一看见他就飞快跑来，那种信任和坦率就仿佛他俩从小就是青梅竹马的伙伴——仿佛现在还依然是这样的小伙伴。如果他因为偶然缘故而未能按时赴约，她就会站到窗下往上呼唤，把那丰润甜美的声音送进他的房间，激荡回响在他身边、在他心中：“乔万尼！乔万尼！你为什么老不来？下来吧！”于是他就赶快下楼，跑到那座毒花盛开的伊甸园中去。

不过，尽管他们彼此这么亲密和熟悉，贝阿特丽丝的举止中仍然含有某种矜持，她始终是那样凛然不可冒犯，使得乔万尼从来不敢转一转大胆造次的念头。从所有可以察觉到的迹象来看，他们在相爱了；他们彼此脉脉含情地凝视，把其中一个人心灵深处的神圣秘密送入另一个人的心灵深处，仿佛这种秘密太圣洁了，不能把它随意付之悄声低语。在激情奔放之中他们也曾情话喁喁，那时他们的心灵就像久久掩藏的火焰喷出火舌一样迸发出话语。然而他们一直没有相吻过，手一直没有相握过，也没有发生过为爱情所应有和崇尚的最轻微的爱抚。他从来没有触摸过她一丝光亮的鬈发；她的衣裙——他们身体接触的明显的物质障碍——也从来没有被微风吹动而轻拂过他的身体。有极少数几次，乔万尼抵抗不了诱惑而试图跨越界限，贝阿特丽丝就会变得那么悲伤、那么严厉，神情会显得那么凄凉和疏远，充满自怨自艾，不用说只言片语就使乔万尼望而却步了。每逢这种时刻，可怕的疑虑便会像魔鬼般从他心灵的洞穴中爬出来，瞪眼向他凝视，令他心惊肉跳；他的爱情就会像晨雾一样变得淡薄而消散；只有怀疑还实实在在地留驻心间。不过，当贝阿特丽丝在短暂的阴郁之后又变得容光焕发时，她立即不再是那个令他如此敬畏和恐惧的神秘可疑的精灵了；她又变成了那个美丽的、天真无邪的姑娘，他觉得自己的心灵对这位姑娘具有超乎一切的真切认识。

自从乔万尼上次见到巴格里奥尼之后，已经过去了很长一段时间。一天上午教授突然来访，使他感到意外和不快，因为好几个礼拜以来他几乎想也没有想到过他，甚至愿意更长久地把他忘掉。像他这样长期处于全身心的亢奋状态中，除了那些完全赞同他目前感情的人以外，是绝不能忍受与任何别的同伴相处的。而从巴格里奥尼教授那里当然不能指望获得这种赞同。

客人随意地谈论了一会儿有关城市和大学里的闲言碎语，接着就转移了话题。

“最近我一直在读一位古典作家的作品，”他说，“读到一个故事颇让我感兴趣。也许你还记得它。故事讲到一位印度王子，他送给亚历山大大帝一位美女作为礼物。她像黎明一样可爱，像夕阳一样绚丽；而最为特出不凡的是她的呼吸中含有某种浓郁的芳香——足以胜过一座波斯玫瑰园。像亚历山大这样一位年轻的君王，对这位奇异的美女自然一见钟情；可是当时恰巧有一位睿智的医生在场，发现了一桩有关她的可怕秘密。”

“是什么呢？”乔万尼问道，他的眼帘低垂，避开了教授的目光。

“这位美女，”巴格里奥尼加重语气说，“从出生之日起就用毒药喂养，直到全身浸透毒素，致使她本人也成了世界上最为致命的毒药。毒素成了她生命的元素。她用呼吸中那浓郁的芳香将空气毒化。她的爱情也是毒药——她的拥抱就意味着死亡。这难道不是一个奇妙的故事吗？”

“不过是哄孩子的无稽之谈。”乔万尼答道，一面神经质地从椅子上跳了起来，“我很奇怪，阁下在严肃的研究工作之余怎么还有闲工夫读这种荒唐的东西。”

“顺便说说，”教授不安地打量着他，“你房间里有什么东西会发出这么奇异的香味？是你手套上洒的香水吗？香味很淡，但很芬芳；然而闻着却非常不舒服。假如闻得太久，我想可能会让我生病的。好像是花的香气，可是我看你房间里根本没有花啊。”

“事实上一朵也没有。”乔万尼回答道，他在教授说话时脸色变得苍白，“而且我认为，除了在阁下的想象之中也并不存在什么香气。气味是一类由感觉与精神结合而成的东西，常常以这种方式欺骗我们。由于对一种香气存在记忆，只要一想到它，就很容易误认为是眼前现实。”

“嗯，不过我清醒的想象力并不经常开这样的玩笑，”巴格里奥尼说，“况且，假如我要想象到什么气味的话，也应该是某种难闻的药剂的气味才对，而我的手指上很可能就沾有很浓的这种味儿。我听说，我们可敬的朋友拉帕西尼，就用比阿拉伯香料还浓的香气来熏制他的药剂。无可怀疑，美丽多才的贝阿特丽丝小姐治疗她的病人，也会使用像少女呼吸的气息一样甜美的药剂；可是喝下这些药剂的人就太不幸了！”

乔万尼的表情显示出他内心充满了情感冲突。教授用那种口吻提到拉帕西尼的纯洁可爱的女儿，对他的心简直是一种酷刑；然而教授对她性格的这种看法与他自己截然对立，又使上千个朦胧的疑点顿时变得清晰起来，现在正像许多妖魔向他狞笑着。不过他仍然竭力打消这些想法，以一个真正情人的忠诚不渝的态度来回答巴格里奥尼。

“教授先生，”他说，“您是我父亲的朋友；或许，您的目的也是要友善地对待他的儿子。我心中对您只有尊重与敬仰；不过我要请您注意，先生，有个话题我们是不应该谈论的。您并不认识贝阿特丽丝小姐。所以您对她的品德不能信口雌黄，妄加贬抑——我甚至可以说这是对她的恶意中伤。”

“乔万尼！我可怜的乔万尼！”教授回答道，镇静的表情中含着怜悯，“对这个可怜的姑娘，我的了解要比你深得多。我会让你知道关于施毒者拉帕西尼和他那有毒的女儿的真实面目；是的，正像她的美丽一样，她也含有毒性。听着，即使你对我这苍苍白发的老人悖逆不敬，也不能让我闭口不谈。那个关于印度女人的古老传说，已经借助拉帕西尼精深而致命的医学变成了现实，就体现在可爱的贝阿特丽丝小姐身上。”

乔万尼呻吟起来，用双手掩住面孔。

“她的父亲，”巴格里奥尼接着说，“全然不顾天伦之情，以这种可怕的方式来养育自己的孩子，使她成为自己对科学的疯狂热情的牺牲品。原因在于，让我们公正地说，他的确是位真正的科学家，连自己的心也像在蒸馏器里经过提纯一样。那么，你的命运又将如何呢？毫无疑问，你被选择出来作为某种新实验的材料了。结局也许是死亡，也许是一种比死亡还要可怕的命运。拉帕西尼的眼中只有他所谓的科学兴趣，干什么都不会有丝毫犹豫的。”

“这是一场梦，”乔万尼喃喃自语，“肯定是一场梦。”

“不过，”教授接着说，“振作起精神来，我老朋友的儿子。现在补救还不算太晚。说不定我们甚至还能让这个可怜的孩子恢复正常天性，脱离被她父亲的疯狂所引入的歧途而回归正道。看看这个小银瓶！它是赫赫有名的本韦努托·切利尼(7)亲手制作的，完全有资格作为一件爱情的赠礼，献给意大利最美丽的贵妇人。不过瓶子里盛的东西却更加珍贵。这种解毒剂只要呷上一小口就能使波吉亚家族(8)最剧烈的毒药失去作用。它对拉帕西尼的毒药无疑也会同样灵验。把这个瓶子连同里面珍贵的药剂一起献给你的贝阿特丽丝，然后满怀希望地静待结果吧。”

巴格里奥尼把一个精雕细琢的小银瓶放在桌上，接着就告辞了，让他的话在年轻人的头脑里去慢慢发生作用。

“我们会挫败拉帕西尼的，”教授这样想，他一面下楼一面暗笑，“可是我们也得承认，他是个了不起的家伙——的确了不起；然而就其医道而言却是个邪恶的骗子，因此医学界内崇尚古老法规的人们对他是不能容忍的。”

正如我们已经说过的，乔万尼在同贝阿特丽丝交往的整个过程中，对她品德的阴暗猜疑偶尔也会袭上心头；不过她给他的感觉总是那么单纯、自然、温情和坦诚，这使得巴格里奥尼教授所描述的形象显得不可思议和不足置信，似乎也不符合乔万尼本人最初的看法。的确，他心中还留有初次见到这个美丽姑娘时得到的丑恶回忆；他无法忘掉在她手中枯萎了的那个花束，在阳光灿烂的空气中死去的那个小虫子，除了她呼吸的气息之外再也找不出任何明显的原因导致这些现象。然而，这些偶发事件却消散在她的性格的纯净光辉中，不再具有事实的效应，而被仅仅认作是错误的幻觉，无论怎样凭感官来进行验证似乎都是如此。世间有些事物就是比我们亲眼所见、亲手所摸的东西还更为真切确实。乔万尼就是凭着这种更好的证据建立起了对贝阿特丽丝的信任，尽管这与其说是因为他本人的深厚信念，倒不如说是由于她的高贵品质发挥了必要的作用。不过现在他的精神已经无法保持在早期的激情所达到的高度了；他跌落下来，匍匐在尘世的疑虑中，从而使贝阿特丽丝纯洁无瑕的形象蒙受了污损。这并不是说他就放弃了她，但他的确是有了怀疑。他决定进行某种能够令他满意的决定性的实验，借此一劳永逸地弄清她身上是否有那些可怕的特性，而这些生理特性是不可能脱离灵魂的畸形而独立存在的。原来见到的那只蜥蜴、虫子和花束，因为当时他的目光是从远处往下看，也许存在错觉；假如他能在数步之遥目睹一朵新鲜而健全的花朵在贝阿特丽丝手里突然凋谢，那就再也没有任何疑问了。怀着这个想法，他匆匆赶到一家花店，买了一束带着晶莹朝露的鲜花。

现在正是每天惯常与贝阿特丽丝会面的时刻。乔万尼在下楼到花园去之前并没有忘记在镜子里照照自己——英俊小伙子不免都有这种虚荣心，不过在目前这苦恼焦躁的时刻还表现出这种心理，未免显出感情的浅薄和性格的虚假。他对镜凝视，心中暗自觉得他的容貌从来不曾像现在这样俊雅，眼神从来不曾这样活泼，脸颊也从来不曾如此红润而富于生气。

“至少，”他想，“她的毒素还没有渗透到我的机体里。我绝不是一朵毁灭在她手中的花。”

他这样想着，一面把目光投向片刻也不曾离手的那束鲜花上。一阵莫名的恐怖猛然袭遍了他的全身，他发现这些尚带露珠的花朵已经开始低低垂落，仿佛它们的鲜活与美丽已经属于昨日。乔万尼的脸色变得像大理石一样苍白，一动不动地站在镜子前面，紧紧瞪视着镜中自己的影像，就像看见了什么可怕的怪物。他想起巴格里奥尼说过房间里似乎弥漫着一种香气。那一定是自己呼吸中所含的毒素！接着他浑身战栗起来——为自己而战栗！当他从僵呆的状态中恢复过来时，好奇的目光开始注意到一只蜘蛛，它正忙着在房间的古老檐板上结网，在那个纵横交错的丝织艺术品上爬来爬去——与任何悬挂在旧天花板上的蜘蛛同样精力弥满，同样充满活力。乔万尼俯身朝向它，呼出了长长的一口气。蜘蛛顿时停止了它的劳作，蛛网也因那个小工匠身体的战抖而随之抖动起来。乔万尼又朝它呼出了一口气，这口气更深更长，充满了发自内心的恶毒感情：他不知道这到底是自己心怀邪恶呢，还是仅仅出于绝望。蜘蛛的肢体痉挛着紧抓在一起，接着就悬挂在窗前死了。

“该死！该死！”乔万尼喃喃地咒骂自己，“你已经有这么强的毒性，呼口气就能断送这只蜘蛛的命吗？”

就在这时，一阵圆润甜美的声音从花园里传了上来。

“乔万尼！乔万尼！时间已经过啦！怎么还在耽搁？快下来吧！”

“是的，”乔万尼又喃喃地说，“她也许是唯一不会被我的呼吸杀死的生物！但愿我也能做到！”

他冲下楼来，即刻就站到了贝阿特丽丝那明亮而深情的目光跟前。就在片刻之前，他的愤慨与绝望还那样强烈，但愿看她一眼就让她顿时生命枯萎；可是一旦她站在了面前，她的影响力却是那么真切实在，简直无法立即摆脱。他还记得她那女性特有的细腻而温和的天性，这种力量常常以一种宗教般的宁静包裹着他；他还记得她许多次迸发出源于内心的圣洁激情，就像清泉从封闭的深处涌出，使他的心灵感受到它的清澈透明。只要乔万尼懂得怎样去估价这些回忆，就会确信有关她的一切丑恶的神秘现象只不过是尘世的幻觉，无论什么邪恶的迷雾笼罩着她，真正的贝阿特丽丝其实是一位超凡的天使。尽管他不能获得这种高度的信念，但她的出现并没有完全丧失其魔力。乔万尼的怒火消退了，化为了一种阴郁的麻木状态。贝阿特丽丝具有一种敏锐的精神感觉力，立即发现他们之间横亘着一条双方都无法逾越的黑暗鸿沟。他们一起走着，悲伤地沉默着，就这样来到了大理石喷泉和它在地上聚成的水池边，水池中央长着那株盛开宝石般花朵的灌木。乔万尼发觉自己正急切地——可以说是如饥似渴地——吸着那些花的香气，不禁感到恐惧。

“贝阿特丽丝，”他突然问道，“这株灌木是从哪儿来的？”

“是我父亲创造的。”她回答说，显得很纯真。

“创造！创造！”乔万尼重复道，“这是什么意思，贝阿特丽丝？”

“他对大自然的奥秘具有惊人的洞悉力。”贝阿特丽丝回答，“就在我来到人世做第一次呼吸的时候，这株树也正好破土而出，它是他的科学之子、智慧之子，而我只是他的尘世的孩子。别靠近它！”她惊骇地发现乔万尼正朝那株灌木越走越近，便叫起来。“它具有你做梦也想不到的一些特性。可是我，亲爱的乔万尼——我跟这棵树一道成长，一道跨入青春花季，被它的芳香所滋养。它是我的姐妹，我以人类的感情爱着它；因为，啊！——你就不曾怀疑过吗？——其中存在着一种可怕的定命。”

这时，乔万尼阴沉地紧锁双眉望着她，使得贝阿特丽丝住了口并战栗起来。但是她信任他的体贴温柔，所以又安下心来，并因自己对他有片刻的怀疑而脸红了。

“一种可怕的定命，”她继续说下去，“由于我父亲对科学那种要命的挚爱，使我完全隔绝了与人类社会的交往，直到上天把你送来，亲爱的乔万尼。啊，你可怜的贝阿特丽丝是多么寂寞啊！”

“这是一种严酷的命运吧？”乔万尼问，目光紧盯着她。

“直到最近我才知道它是多么严酷。”她柔声答道，“啊，真是这样。不过以前我的心麻木了，所以才感到宁静。”

乔万尼的阴郁情绪中突然爆发出一团怒火，就像乌云中猛然闪现出一道电光。“该死的家伙！”他叫道，满怀恶毒的轻蔑与愤慨，“你觉得自己孤单无聊，就要同样割断我与生活的一切温暖的联系，把我哄骗进你那无可言喻的恐怖世界里去吗！”

“乔万尼！”贝阿特丽丝高声喊道，转过她那双明亮的大眼睛来盯着他的脸。他这番话的真正力量还没有对她的头脑发生影响，她仅仅是感到惊骇。

“是的，你这有毒的东西！”乔万尼重复道，他已激动得不能自持了，“你已经这样干了！你已经毁了我！你已经让我的血管里充满了毒汁！你已经把我变成了跟你一样可恨、一样丑恶、一样恶心和可怕的东西——一个举世罕见的骇人听闻的恶魔！好吧，要是我们的气息对彼此来说，有幸也像对其他所有人一样致命，那就让我们怀着说不出的仇恨接个吻，一同死去吧！”

“什么灾难降临到了我的头上？”贝阿特丽丝喃喃自语道，从心底发出一声低微的呻吟，“圣母呵，可怜我这个心碎的孩子吧！”

“你——你也会祈祷？”乔万尼叫道，仍然满怀恶毒的轻蔑，“就连你的祈祷，因为发自你的唇间，也会以死亡玷污空气。是的，是的，让我们祈祷吧！让我们到教堂去，把手指浸入门前的圣水中！跟在我们后面的人就会像患瘟疫一样死去！让我们在空中画十字吧！它将以神圣象征的面目把诅咒散布四方！”

“乔万尼！”贝阿特丽丝平静地说，因为她的悲痛已经超过了激愤，“你为什么要用这些可怕的话来把你和我连在一起？我，的确就是你所说的那种可恶的东西。可是你——除了对我丑恶的不幸再发一次抖，然后走出花园去加入你的同类，忘掉大地上曾经爬行过一个像可怜的贝阿特丽丝这样的妖魔之外，还有什么别的可做呢？”

“你还想装作一无所知吗？”乔万尼满面怒容地瞪着她，“看吧！这种力量就是我从拉帕西尼的纯洁的女儿身上获得的！”

这时正好有一群夏虫在空中疾飞，因为嗅到这座致命花园的花香而前来觅食。它们绕着乔万尼的头顶兜圈子，而吸引它们的力量显然与刚才它们飞去的几株树木是相同的。他朝着那些虫子吐出了一口气，当至少有十几个虫子坠地而死时，他朝贝阿特丽丝苦涩地笑了笑。

“我明白了！我明白了！”贝阿特丽丝尖叫道，“这是我父亲那致命的科学造成的！不，不，乔万尼，不是我！绝不是，绝不是！我只梦想过爱你，和你短暂地相处一阵，然后让你离开，只把你的形象留在我心中。乔万尼，相信我的话，尽管我的身体是用毒药培育的，我的灵魂却是上帝的创造物，时刻渴望得到爱的滋养。可是我的父亲——他竟利用这种可怕的共同感情把我们联系起来。好吧，你唾弃我吧，践踏我吧，杀死我吧！啊，听你讲了那番话后，死还算得了什么呢？不过这不是我干的。哪怕给我全世界的幸福，我也不会做这种事！”

乔万尼的激怒在那一番话语爆发中已耗竭殆尽。现在他心中泛起了一种哀伤之情，一想到贝阿特丽丝与他的亲密而特殊的关系，还生出了几许柔情。他们站在那儿，处于绝对孤独之中，即使置身在最拥挤的人群里，这种孤独也绝不会减少半分。那么，既然被周围的人们所抛弃，难道不应该使这与世隔绝的一对年轻人更加亲密吗？要是他们还彼此残酷折磨，又有谁会以仁慈对待他们呢？况且，乔万尼想道，难道自己就没有希望恢复正常天性，并与获救的贝阿特丽丝携手同行吗？啊，你这虚弱、自私、卑劣的灵魂！在乔万尼用如此狠毒的言辞剧烈地伤害了像贝阿特丽丝的爱这样深沉的爱情之后，竟然还在梦想可能获得尘世姻缘与人间幸福！不，不，绝不可能存在这种希望了。她不得不带着那颗破碎的心，沉重地跨过时光的边界——她不得不到天堂的清泉边去洗浴自己的创伤，在永恒的光辉中忘却自己的哀痛，并在那里得到康复。

然而乔万尼并不明白这一点。

“亲爱的贝阿特丽丝。”他说，并朝她走去；她也像通常他走近时那样往后退缩，但这次是出于一种不同的冲动。“亲爱的贝阿特丽丝，我们的命运并非绝无希望。看！这儿有一种烈性药剂，一位明智博学的医生向我保证说它具有神奇的疗效。构成它的成分，与你那可怕的父亲给你和我造成灾难的东西截然相反。它是从赐福于人的药草中提炼出来的。让我们一起喝下它，从邪恶中获得净化好吗？”

“给我！”贝阿特丽丝说，一面伸手接过乔万尼从怀中取出的那个小银瓶。她还特别加重语气补充了一句：“我愿意喝，不过你一定要等待着结果。”

她把巴格里奥尼的解毒剂举向唇边。就在这时候，拉帕西尼的身影出现在拱门下，并缓步朝大理石喷泉走来。他渐渐地走近；这位面色苍白的科学家满脸扬扬自得之情，观看着那一对美丽的年轻人，犹如一位艺术家耗尽毕生精力完成了一幅画像或者一组雕塑，对自己的最后成功踌躇满志一样。他停下脚步；伛偻的身躯有意识地挺得笔直；他把双手朝他们伸出来，那姿势就像一位父亲在恳求孩子们向他祝福似的；然而正是这同一双手把毒药投进了他们生命的溪流中。乔万尼浑身战栗。贝阿特丽丝紧张得发抖，用一只手紧紧按住胸口。

“我的女儿，”拉帕西尼说，“你在世上不再孤独了。从你的姐妹树上摘下一朵珍宝之花，请你的新郎戴在他胸前吧。现在它不会伤害他了。我的科学和你与他之间的共同感情业已深深作用于他的机体，现在他已经和普通男人迥然不同了，正像你，我引以为骄傲和荣耀的女儿，与普通女人不同一样。今后你们一起在世界上生活，彼此相亲相爱，而所有人都会惧怕你们！”

“我的父亲，”贝阿特丽丝用虚弱的声音说道——她一边说一边仍然按住胸口——“你为什么要把这种悲惨的命运强加在你孩子身上？”

“悲惨！”拉帕西尼叫道，“你这是什么意思，傻姑娘？具有这种神奇的禀赋，没有任何力量能够与之匹敌，你能说这是悲惨吗？呼出一口气就能打败最强大的敌人，这是悲惨吗？你有多么美丽，就有多么可怕，这是悲惨吗？难道你宁愿处于弱女人的境地，面临各种邪恶而自己却不能拿起邪恶的武器？”

“我宁愿被人爱而不愿让人怕。”贝阿特丽丝喃喃地说，慢慢倒伏在地上，“不过现在没什么关系了。我要死了，父亲，您竭尽全力向我的生命中混杂进的邪恶也像梦幻一样地消逝了——就像这些毒花的香气一样，在伊甸园的花丛中，它们再也不能污染我的呼吸。别了，乔万尼！你那些仇恨的话语就像铅一般沉重地压在我心头，不过在我飞升之时它们将会坠落的。啊，从一开始，你的天性中是不是就比我的天性中含有更多的毒素呢？”

对于贝阿特丽丝而言——她的身体已经被拉帕西尼的技艺施行了如此彻底的改造——毒药就是生命，所以烈性解毒药就意味着死亡。就这样，这个人类独创性与扭曲天性的可怜的牺牲品，这个承受了堕落智慧一切尝试的灾难命运的无辜者，就死在了她父亲和乔万尼的脚下。就在这个时候，巴格里奥尼教授正从楼上的窗户往下看，他用一种胜利中混杂着恐惧的声音大声呼唤，朝着那位如遭雷击的科学家叫道——“拉帕西尼！拉帕西尼！这是不是你想要的实验结果？”

牧师的黑面纱

——一则寓言(1)


教堂司事站在米尔福礼拜堂的门廊里，使劲地拉着钟绳。村里的老人们弯腰驼背地沿着街道走来。孩子们满面笑颜，蹦跳着跟在父母身边，或者模仿出庄重的步伐，留意要显示出礼拜日盛装的派头。衣冠楚楚的单身小伙子们斜眼偷看着漂亮姑娘，觉得安息日的阳光使她们显得比平日更加漂亮。当人群大都拥进门廊之后，司事开始打钟，同时紧盯着胡珀牧师的房门。牧师一露面，也就意味着该停止召唤的钟声了。

“胡珀牧师在脸上弄了个什么东西啊？”司事惊讶地叫起来。

所有听见的人都立刻转过身来，看见一个身形酷似胡珀先生的人，正若有所思地缓缓迈步朝礼拜堂走来。人们全都惊呆了，即使是一位陌生的牧师来占据了胡珀先生布道坛上的座位，他们也不会表示出比现在更大的惊异。

“你敢肯定那就是我们的牧师吗？”古德曼·格雷问司事。

“那当然是胡珀先生啦，”司事回答说，“今天他本该跟韦斯特伯里的舒特牧师对换讲道的；但舒特牧师昨天捎信说不来了，他要去做一场葬礼祈祷。”

造成这一番惊诧的原因，似乎完全不足为怪。胡珀牧师年纪大约三十，很有绅士风度，虽然仍是单身，但衣着却不失牧师应有的整洁，好像有一位细心的妻子为他浆洗过领箍，刷净了礼拜日法衣上一周来沾染的灰尘。他的外表只有一件东西引人注目，那就是箍在前额上、垂下来遮住脸庞的一张黑面纱，一直低垂得随他的呼吸而微微颤动。更近些看，面纱似乎是用两层绉绸做成的，除了嘴和下巴，整个面部都被遮掩起来了，不过或许并没有挡住他的视线，只是给眼前一切有生命和无生命的东西蒙上了一层黑影而已。虔诚的胡珀先生眼前就带着这片黑影，迈着缓慢而沉静的步子走来，像心不在焉的人通常那样微微佝偻身躯，两眼望着地面，但对候立在礼拜堂台阶上的教民们仍然和蔼地点头致意。不过他们都惊呆了，以至于忘了还礼。

“我真不敢相信那块绢纱后面就是胡珀先生的脸。”司事说。

“我不喜欢它。”一个老妪蹒跚地走进礼拜堂，喃喃自语道，“他把脸一藏起来，就变成一个吓人的怪物了。”

“我们的牧师疯啦！”古德曼·格雷一边说，一边跟在他身后跨过了门槛。

胡珀牧师还没进礼拜堂，这件不可思议的怪事就传开了，教友们全都骚动起来。谁都忍不住扭头朝门口张望；许多人站了起来，索性转过身子；有几个小男孩爬到椅背上又摔下来，引发了一阵喧闹。礼拜堂里一片乱哄哄，女人的衣裙沙沙作响，男人的脚步在地面擦动，和恭候牧师莅临时应有的肃静迥然不同。然而胡珀牧师似乎对教民们的骚乱不安视而不见。他几乎是悄无声息地走了进来，对两旁一排排座位上的会众微微颔首，在走过最年长的教民身边时还鞠了一躬，那是位满头白发的老人，坐在通道中间的一把扶手椅上。奇怪的是，这位年高德劭的老人迟迟没有觉察到牧师的外表有什么异常。他好像并没怎么感受到充满教堂的惊诧情绪，直到胡珀先生登上了阶梯，站在了布道坛上，隔着那块黑面纱与听众们面对面时，这才有所察觉。牧师戴着的那个神秘的标志一刻也没有摘下过。在他领唱圣诗时，它随着他均匀的呼吸而起伏；他朗读《圣经》时，它就在他和圣书之间投下阴影。他祈祷时，它就沉甸甸地紧贴在他仰起的脸上。难道他要向自己所祈祷的可畏的上帝隐藏自己的面孔吗？

这小小一块黑纱的影响是如此巨大，不止一个神经脆弱的女人因此而被迫离开了教堂。然而，面色苍白的会众在牧师眼里，或许就像他的黑面纱在他们眼里同样的可怕呢。

胡珀先生因善于布道而享有盛誉，但他并不以雄辩有力取胜，而是尽量通过温和的劝导作用来引得教民们心向天国，并非借助雷霆震撼般的圣言来驱使人们前进。他此时的布道，也具有其通常的风格和方式上的特点。可是，或许是因为布道词中所带的情绪，或许是由于听众的想象，总之，他今天的言辞中蕴含着某种东西，使得大家感到这是他们所听过的牧师布道中最倾力动情的一次。它比平日的布道更带有胡珀先生气质中固有的那种轻柔的忧郁色调。他演讲的主题涉及隐秘的罪孽，那些我们对最亲近的人和对自己的良知都想要隐藏的伤心隐秘，甚至忘记了全知全能的上帝是会洞察一切的。他的言辞中渗入了一种难以捉摸的力量。听众中的每一个人，无论是最纯洁的少女还是心如铁石的恶棍，都觉得躲在可怕面纱后面的牧师似乎已偷偷逼近，探知到了他们的思想与行为中隐藏着的罪恶。许多人把自己交叉的双手按在胸膛上。胡珀先生所讲的话并不可怕，至少并不激烈；然而，他那忧郁声调的每一个颤音都令听众浑身战栗。伴随着恐惧而来的，是一种不期而至的悲怆。听众们强烈感受到牧师有些反常，都盼望有一股轻风能把那块面纱吹开，而且几乎相信露出来的会是一张陌生的面孔，虽然那身形、姿态、声音是属于胡珀先生的。

礼拜刚结束，教友们便毫无规矩地乱成一团，争先恐后地往外跑，急切地要相互交流压抑在心头的惊异；而一旦眼前没有了那块黑面纱，他们也感到心情轻松了许多。有些人围成一个个小圈子，紧紧挤作一团窃窃私语；有些人独自往家里走，一路上默默沉思；有些人高声谈论着，故意放声大笑来亵渎安息日。有那么几个人自作聪明地摇着头，暗示说他们能看穿这个秘密；而有一两个人则断言这事根本没有任何奥秘，只不过是胡珀先生的视力在深夜受到了灯光的损害，因此需要遮一遮。稍过片刻之后，胡珀牧师也跟在教民身后走出来了。他把蒙着面纱的脸从这一群人转向那一群人，向白发长者表示应有的敬意，又以和蔼的庄重态度对中年人致意，犹如他们的朋友和精神导师；他也带着爱护与威严招呼那些年轻人，并把手放到孩子们头上，为他们祝福。这些都是他在安息日的老习惯了。然而今天回报他的好意的，却只是惊异和困惑的目光。没有一个人像往常那样，渴望得到与牧师同行的荣耀。老乡绅桑德斯无疑是因为记忆力偶然出错，忘了邀请胡珀先生去他家进餐，而自从牧师到这里就职以来，几乎每个礼拜天总是要到他家的饭桌上祝福的。这样，他只好回到自己的牧师寓所，就在他关门的时候，回头望了望背后的人们，大家的目光全都紧盯着他。黑面纱后面隐隐露出了一丝忧伤的笑容，闪烁在他的嘴角，随即就同他一起消失了。

“真奇怪，”一个妇女说，“一块普通的黑面纱，就跟女人们系在帽子上的一模一样，可在胡珀先生的脸上竟会变得这么可怕！”

“胡珀先生的脑子肯定出了毛病，”她的丈夫、村子里的医生说，“不过这件事顶奇怪的地方就在他这古怪行为所产生的力量，就连我这样头脑清醒的人都受到了震动。那块黑纱尽管只遮住了牧师的脸，却影响到了他整个的人，使他从头到脚都现出鬼气。你难道不觉得吗？”

“我真的感觉到了，”那个女人答道，“我怎么也不敢单独跟他待在一起。我真纳闷，他自己是不是也怕自己！”

“人有时候是会自己怕自己的。”她丈夫说。

下午举行礼拜式的情况同上午相似。结束的时候，为一位年轻姑娘的葬礼敲响了丧钟。亲戚和朋友都聚集在丧家的屋子里，关系比较疏远的熟人站在门边，谈论着死者的种种好处。他们的谈话突然被胡珀牧师的到来打断，他仍旧戴着那块黑面纱，现在它倒是一种恰当的标志了。牧师走进停放遗体的房间，朝棺材俯下身子，向自己已故的教民做最后的告别。在他弯腰的时候，面纱从他的额头上直垂下来，假如死去的姑娘的眼睛并不是永远地合上了，她就会看见他的面孔。莫非胡珀牧师害怕她的目光，才这样匆忙地把面纱往后拉好？有个人目睹了这场生者与死者的会面，他毫不迟疑地证实说，就在牧师露出面容的一刹那，尸体曾微微地战栗起来，尸衣和薄纱女帽都沙沙作响，虽然姑娘的面容依然保持着死者的宁静。一个迷信的老太太是这一奇迹的唯一见证人。胡珀牧师离开棺木进入哀悼室，然后又走到楼梯口，开始做葬礼祈祷。那是一篇饱含温情、感人肺腑的祷文，充满哀痛，但又深深浸润着天国的希望，在牧师悲怆至极的音调之间，仿佛能依稀听见姑娘的纤指在轻柔地拨动着天堂的琴弦。牧师祈祷说，但愿人们和他自己以及世间众生，都能像这位姑娘一样从容地迎接撕去面纱的可怕时刻，这时大家都不寒而栗，尽管他们并不完全理解这话的意义。抬棺材的人沉重地迈步前行，后面跟着送葬的队列；死者在他们前面，胡珀牧师戴着面纱走在后头，整个街道都充满了哀伤。

“你怎么朝后看啊？”送葬队伍中有个人问他的同伴。

“我好像觉得，”她回答说，“刚才牧师和这姑娘的鬼魂手拉手地一块儿走着哩。”

“我也觉得是这样，也是在刚才那会儿。”另一位说。

当夜，米尔福村里最漂亮的一对男女要举行婚礼。虽然人们认为胡珀牧师是个性情忧郁的人，但他在这种场合也会具有一种平静的愉悦，它常常比活泼欢闹更能激起亲和的微笑。再没有什么比他的性格中的这一特点更能赢得教民们的爱戴了。婚礼上的众宾客都急切地等待着他的光临，都深信一整天笼罩着他的那种奇异的可畏神情现在一定烟消云散了。然而结果并非如此。胡珀牧师进门的时候，人们第一眼看到的仍然是那块可怕的黑面纱，它曾经给葬礼增添了更深的哀愁，但给婚礼带来的却只能是凶兆。它立刻使宾客们感到仿佛有一团乌云从面纱下面黑黢黢地涌出，掩蔽了花烛的光亮。一对新人在牧师面前站起来。可是新娘冰凉的手指在新郎抖动的手里战栗着，她那像死一般苍白的脸色引起了一阵窃窃私语，说是几个钟头前刚下葬的那个姑娘钻出坟墓来入洞房啦。如果说世上还有像这么阴惨的婚礼，也就只能是著名的在婚礼上敲响丧钟的那一次了。(2)仪式主持完毕，胡珀牧师举起酒杯，祝新婚夫妇幸福，他的语调温和而幽默，本该像炉中欢跳的火光，映照得宾客们容光焕发。但就在这一瞬间，他从镜子里看见了自己的形象，那块黑面纱便把他自己的心灵也卷进了淹没众人的恐惧之中。他浑身发抖——嘴唇发白——他把尚未沾唇的酒洒泼在了地毯上——接着他就冲进了茫茫黑夜里。因为，大地也戴着自己的黑面纱。

第二天，整个米尔福村只议论着一件事，那就是胡珀牧师的黑面纱。那块面纱和它后面所隐藏的秘密，成为相熟的人们街谈巷议的话题，也为女人们打开窗户说闲言碎语提供了材料。它成了小酒店老板向顾客发布的头条新闻。孩子们在上学的路上也叽叽喳喳地说着它。一个喜欢模仿的小调皮用一块旧黑手巾把自己的脸遮起来，这一来不但把同伴们吓得要死，连他本人也被自己的恶作剧吓得几乎神志错乱。

奇怪的是，教区里所有那些爱管闲事和行事莽撞之徒，没有一个敢直截了当地问胡珀牧师他为什么要这样做。在此之前，只要他看起来有点芝麻大的小事需要人过问，从来就不缺出主意的人，而且他自己也总是愿意听从别人的意见。如果说他有什么过错的话，那就是太缺乏自信，即使是最温和的指责也会使他把自己无关紧要的行为看得像桩罪过。然而，尽管教民们都深知他这种性格随和的弱点，却没有一个人愿意就黑面纱这个问题对他进行友好的规劝。大家有种既不挑明也不细心遮掩的恐惧感，使得人人都在互相推诿责任。最后只好想出一条权宜之计，选派一批教会代表去同胡珀牧师商谈，以免这件怪事最后酿成丑闻。从来没有一个使团会这么糟糕地履行自己的职责。牧师友好而礼貌地接待了他们，但等到客人落座之后他便一言不发，把挑明这项重大事务的重担整个地留给来客们去承担。话题本身是显而易见的，大家都心中有数。那块黑面纱就箍在胡珀牧师的额头上，掩盖着他的脸，下面只露出安详的嘴唇，大家可以察觉到嘴角边时而闪过一丝忧伤的微笑。然而在他们的想象中，那块黑纱却似乎一直垂挂到他的胸前，成为一桩可怕秘密的象征横亘在他与他们之间。只要把那块面纱拉开，他们就可以无拘无束地谈论它，但不拉开它简直就无法启齿。他们就这样坐了很久，缄口无言，心烦意乱，不安地躲避着胡珀牧师的目光，觉得那道看不见的目光一直紧盯在他们身上。最后，代表们只得羞愧地回去见他们的推举人，宣称这起重大事件处理起来太棘手，即使不需召开教民大会，至少也得举行教会会议才行。

这块黑面纱弄得村里所有的人都胆战心惊，但有一个女人却并不害怕。代表们没有从牧师那里得到任何解释，甚至连问题也不敢问一个，她却以自己性格中的沉静的力量，决心要驱散那片愈益浓黑地聚集在牧师头上的诡奇阴云。作为他的未婚妻，她有权知道黑面纱之下所掩藏的是什么。因此，在牧师事后第一次来看她的时候，她就简单直接地一下子进入话题，这倒使事情对他和她来说都容易得多了。牧师坐下之后，她就目不转睛地盯着那块面纱，但并没有发现那种威慑住众人的恐怖阴霾：它只不过是一块双层绢纱罢了，从他的额上垂到嘴边，随着他的呼吸而微微颤动。

“不，”她一边笑一边高声说，“这块纱没什么好怕的，只不过遮住了我老是喜欢看的一张脸罢了。来吧，我的好人，让阳光从乌云后面显露出来吧。先把面纱摘下来，再告诉我你为什么要戴着它。”

胡珀牧师脸上微微闪烁过一丝笑容。

“到了某个时辰，”他说，“我们都得摘下自己的面纱。而在那个时辰之前，如果我一直戴着它的话，亲爱的朋友，请你不要见怪。”

“你的话也这么神秘莫测。”姑娘回答道，“至少该把罩在你的话语上面的纱摘掉吧。”

“伊丽莎白，我愿意这么做，”他说，“只要我的誓言允许。你要知道，这块面纱是一个表记和标志，我受誓言的约束，必须永远佩戴，不论是在光明还是黑暗之中，不论是独自一人还是在众目睽睽之下，也不论是与陌生人交往还是与亲朋好友相处。世上绝没有任何人能看见它被摘下。这道阴郁的帘幕必定将我与尘世隔绝：就连你，伊丽莎白，也永远看不到它的后面！”

“什么深重的苦难降临到了你的头上，”她热切地问道，“使你要这样永远遮暗自己的眼睛？”

“如果说它是一种哀悼的象征，”胡珀牧师回答说，“那么或许我也跟大多数世人一样，怀着如此阴郁的哀伤，需要用一块黑面纱来做表记。”

“可是假如世人不相信它只是清白无邪的哀伤的表记呢？”伊丽莎白极力劝说道，“尽管你受到人们的爱戴和尊重，但也难免有流言蜚语，说你是因为自知犯了隐秘的罪恶才掩盖住自己的面目。为你的圣职着想，驱散这种谣言吧。”

她向他暗示村子里已经流传开来的那些谣言的性质，不禁脸都涨红了。可是胡珀牧师仍然保持着他温和的神情。他甚至又笑了笑——还是那种哀伤的微笑，它总是像一道若有若无的微光，从面纱的暗影下闪现出来。

“如果我是因为悲痛而遮住面孔，自然有充足的理由，”他只是这样回答，“如果我遮住面孔是因为有不可告人的罪过，那么世人谁不可以这样做呢？”

他就这样温和而又不可动摇地拒绝了她的一切恳求。最后伊丽莎白沉默了。她有一阵子似乎陷入了沉思，或许在考虑还有什么新方法可以试一试，把她的情人从如此阴郁的妄想中拉出来；这件事即使没有其他含义，也很可能是神志错乱的征象啊。尽管她的性格比他更坚强，禁不住泪珠也从脸颊上滚落下来了。可是，在一刹那间，仿佛有一种新的感觉取代了悲伤：在她的目光茫然地盯住那块黑面纱的时候，就好像空中突然浮现出一片暗影，黑面纱带来的恐惧包裹住了她。她站起来，在他面前战栗着。

“看来你终于也感觉到了？”他哀伤地说。

她不回答，用手掩住双眼，转身要离开房间。他冲上前去一把抓住她的手臂。

“对我容忍些，伊丽莎白！”他激动地喊道，“别抛下我，尽管这块面纱今生今世必定要阻隔在我们之间。做我的妻子吧，来世我脸上再不会蒙上面纱了，也不会有黑暗阻隔开我们的灵魂了！这不过是现世的面纱——不是永恒的！啊！你不知道我独自待在黑面纱后面是多么孤独，多么害怕！别把我永远留在这悲惨的黑暗中！”

“那就把面纱揭开一次，面对面看我一眼。”她说。

“不！绝对不行！”胡珀牧师回答。

“那么，别了！”伊丽莎白说。

她抽出自己的手臂，慢慢地走开，到门边停了一下，向他投去久久的、战栗的凝视，似乎要刺穿黑面纱的秘密。而胡珀牧师尽管沉浸在悲痛中，却仍然在微笑，他心想仅仅是一种物质的标记便把他与幸福拆开了，然而它所投下的恐怖阴影才注定会使最相爱的情侣心灵阻隔。

从那时起，再没有人试图让胡珀牧师摘掉黑面纱，也不再径直要求探知面纱背后所掩藏的秘密。有些人自认为见识比常人偏见更高明，把这件事仅仅视为一种怪癖，而这种怪癖通常会与本来很正常的人的理智行为混合在一起，从而使他们的所有行为都带上疯癫的色彩。但在大多数人眼中，胡珀牧师却是个无可救药的怪物。他无法心平气和地在街道上走，总发现温良胆小的人们转身躲避他，而另一些人则故意挡住他的路来显示自己胆子大。后者的粗鲁无礼迫使他放弃了日落时分到墓地散步的老习惯，因为每当他靠在墓地门上沉思的时候，墓碑后面就会有人探头探脑地偷窥他的黑面纱。有一种谣言四处流传，说是死人的凝望把他引到那儿去的。使他仁慈的心被深深刺痛的是，看到孩子们在他走来的时候立即中断最欢乐的游戏，四散奔逃，其实他那忧郁的身影还离得很远。他们本能的恐惧比其他任何事都使他更强烈地感到，有一种异乎寻常的恐怖与黑面纱的丝缕紧紧交织在了一起。事实上，大家都知道他本人对黑面纱也深为厌恶，若非不得已，他绝对不从镜子前经过，也绝不俯身去饮静止的泉水，以免在它宁静的怀抱中看到自己的形象而受到惊吓。正是这一点引起了许多貌似有理的谣言，说是胡珀牧师的良心承受着某种巨大罪孽的煎熬，这可怕的罪孽既然不能全盘掩盖，便只好这样朦胧地加以暗示。于是，从黑面纱下面便有一团乌云涌向阳光，这是一种含糊不清的罪孽或哀伤，紧紧地裹住了可怜的牧师，使得爱与同情永远也到不了他身边。据说鬼魂和魔鬼在黑纱后面与他做伴。他就这样无休止地走在黑面纱的阴影中，内心战战兢兢，外表充满恐惧，在自己灵魂的黑暗中摸索着，或者透过那块面纱凝望着被它弄得暗淡惨伤的世界。人们相信，甚至肆无忌惮的风也尊重牧师那可怕的秘密，从来不把那块面纱吹起。不过，仁慈的胡珀牧师在走过熙来攘往的人群时，仍然要向着世人苍白的面孔哀伤地微笑。

黑面纱尽管产生了这些恶劣影响，却也有一种称心合意的效果，那就是使得佩戴它的人成了一位非常胜任的牧师。借助于自己的这一神秘表记——因为除此之外看不出还有什么明显的原因——他对于因罪孽而痛苦的灵魂便具有令人敬畏的力量。受他感召而皈依正道的人心中对他怀有特殊的畏惧，他们断言，虽然是以比喻的方式，说在被他引入天国的光明之前，他们曾同他一道陷没在那块黑面纱后面。的确，黑纱的阴影使得他能与一切阴郁的感情发生感应。垂死的罪人大声呼喊胡珀牧师，在他到场之前不肯咽气，尽管在他俯身对他们悄声抚慰的时候，他们会因为蒙着黑纱的面孔靠得那么近而浑身战栗。黑面纱的威力是这么可怕，甚至当死神露面时也是如此！陌生人从远处赶到他的教堂来聆听他布道，只不过是出于消遣的目的想要看看他的身影，因为他的脸是看不到的。可是许多人还等不到离开就已吓得战战兢兢！有一次，在贝尔切总督的任期内，胡珀牧师被指定为选举进行布道。他面戴黑纱站在首席行政官、地方自治会和代表们面前，给大家留下了那么深的印象，以致那一年通过的法案也带有最早期宗法统治的阴郁与虔诚。

就这样，胡珀牧师度过了漫长的一生，他行为固然无可指责，却被包裹在阴暗的猜疑之中；他和蔼而慈爱，却不为人所爱，而且为人所莫名畏惧；他与世人隔绝，被排除在众人的健康与快乐之外，却又总在人们临终痛苦之时被召去帮助他们。岁月流逝，在他那罩着黑面纱的额头上洒满了霜雪，他也在新英格兰一带的教会中获得了盛名，大家都叫他胡珀教长。在他到任时已届成年的那代教民如今差不多都已相继辞世，他在礼拜堂里有一批教民，更多的则挤在墓地里。他终于进入了生命的迟暮，在一生恪守职责之后，胡珀教长现在也该安息了。

在老教长临终的病榻前，借着惨淡的烛光，依稀可见几个人影。他没有任何亲属。但到场的有那位庄重合度却不动声色的医生，他只能尽力减轻无可救治的病人的最后痛苦。几位教堂执事和教区其他几位以虔诚著称的教友也在场。在场的还有韦斯特伯里教区的克拉克牧师，这是一位热心肠的年轻牧师，他骑马赶到垂危的教长床前来为他祈祷。还有那位看护，她绝不是一个受雇来照料垂危病人的女仆，她那宁静的感情经历了漫长的时日，忍受了沉默、孤独和岁月的严寒而始终不渝，直至这生离死别的一刻。她正是伊丽莎白！胡珀教长那白发苍苍的头靠在死亡之枕上，黑面纱依旧箍在他的额头上，把整个面庞遮住，随着他愈益艰难的每一次微弱呼吸而微微颤动。在他一生中，这块黑纱始终横隔在他与人世之间，隔绝了欢悦的友情和女性的爱恋，把他禁锢在最悲惨的牢狱之中，也就是他自己的心中。现在它仍然蒙在他的脸上，仿佛使得这阴暗的房间愈加阴郁，并且挡住了他面前的永生的阳光。

此前一段时间里，他已经神志不清了，灵魂疑虑重重地徘徊于过去和现在之间，时不时地仿佛跨进了未来世界的混沌之中。他反复地发着高烧，辗转反侧，所剩无几的精力已耗竭殆尽。但即使在最剧烈的痉挛挣扎和最荒诞的迷思狂想之中，当任何别的念头都已混乱不清时，他仍然显得提心吊胆，生怕黑面纱会滑落开去。其实，即使他迷乱的灵魂有可能忘记这一点，在他枕边还有一位忠实的女人，她会移开目光，为他遮好那张衰老的面孔，而当她最后一次见到这张面孔时它还是成年男子的俊秀容颜。最后，濒临死亡的老人静静地躺着，因精神与肉体的衰竭而陷于麻木之中，脉搏已经感觉不到了，气息也越来越微弱，只有一阵深长而不规律的呼吸，似乎在预报他的灵魂即将逃逸。

韦斯特伯里教区的牧师走到了床边。

“尊敬的胡珀教长，”他说，“您解脱的时刻即将到来。您是否准备揭开这块隔绝现时与永生的面纱呢？”

胡珀教长起初只是把手微微动了动来表示回答；接着，或许是担心他的意思可能不够明确，又竭尽余力开口说话。

“是的，”他用衰弱的声音说道，“我的灵魂忍辱负重、疲惫不堪，要等到揭开面纱后才能解脱啊。”

“难道说，”克拉克牧师接着说，“像你这样一个终生虔诚祈祷、按凡人的尺度堪称思想行为圣洁和毫无瑕疵的典范，戴着黑面纱是合适的吗？难道说一位教会长老能给人们对自己的回忆留下一道阴影，从而玷污如此纯洁的生命吗？我请求你，可敬的兄长，不要让这样的事情发生！在您获得永生的回报之前，请让我们有幸一睹你欢悦的容颜吧。在揭开来世的帏幔之前，请让我先揭去你脸上的这块黑面纱吧！”

说着，克拉克牧师俯身向前，要去揭示这个深藏多年的秘密。然而，胡珀牧师突然迸发出惊人的力量，让周围的人都吓得目瞪口呆。他猛地从被盖下面伸出双手，用力按住黑面纱，决心硬拼到底，假如韦斯特伯里的牧师真要跟一个垂死的人争斗的话。

“绝不！”戴面纱的教长喊道，“今生今世绝不！”

“愚昧的老人！”吓坏了的牧师叫道，“你的灵魂正带着多么可怕的罪孽去接受最后审判啊？”

胡珀教长艰难地呼吸着；一丝气息在喉咙里咯咯作响；可是他仍在奋力挣扎，伸出双手乱抓，想要抓住正在消逝的生命，好把话讲完。他甚至从床上撑起身子；他坐了起来，在死神的怀抱中瑟瑟战抖，而那块黑面纱则低垂着，在这最后的时刻把整整一生的恐怖都凝聚起来，显得极其可怕。他脸上常常浮现的那种细微而忧伤的笑容，此刻仿佛又从黑面纱的暗影后面闪现出来，在胡珀教长的唇边久久流连。

“你们为什么只是见了我才怕得发抖？”他高声说道，一边转过戴着黑面纱的脸环顾四周面色苍白的围观者，“你们彼此相见也该害怕得发抖！男人们躲着我，女人们没有一丝同情，孩子们尖叫着逃开，只是因为我的黑面纱吗？这有什么可怕呢，难道不是它所隐晦地象征着的神秘，才使得这块薄纱如此令人恐惧吗？等到朋友之间能推心置腹，爱人之间能坦诚相见，等到人们不再妄想逃避造物主的目光，令人厌恶地藏匿自己罪恶的秘密，到那时再因我生时戴着、死也不离的这个象征物而把我看成怪物吧！我环顾四周，看啊！你们的每一张脸上都有一块黑面纱！”

听众都惊怖万分，互相躲避，胡珀教长则仰面倒在枕头上，成了一具蒙着面纱的死尸，嘴唇边却仍然带着一丝残留不去的笑意。他就这样戴着面纱被人们装入棺木，也这样戴着面纱被埋进坟墓。年复一年，青草在这座坟墓上萌发又枯萎，墓碑上也长满了青苔，胡珀牧师的脸化为了尘土；可是一想到它是在那块黑面纱下衰朽腐烂的，人们仍然会凛然生畏！

大约在一百二十年前，舒特上校就任马萨诸塞湾政府总督之后不久，一位既有地位又很富有的年轻小姐从英格兰来到此地，要求他做她的保护人。他只是她的远亲，但又是她渐趋灭绝的家族中尚在人世的最近亲属；因此，对于富有而出身高贵的埃莉诺·罗彻克利夫小姐来说，再也找不到比大西洋彼岸殖民地这个行省的政府更适宜的庇护所了。此外，舒特总督的夫人自埃莉诺小姐幼小时起对她就像母亲一样，如今也正急切地想要接纳她，希望美丽年轻的小姐生活在新英格兰的纯朴社会里，不会像置身于宫廷的阴谋诡计和腐化堕落中那么危险。假如总督或者他的夫人对他们自己的舒适安乐加以特别考虑的话，大概会想办法将这份责任推到别人手里去；因为埃莉诺小姐尽管具有某些高贵而杰出的品德，却以粗暴苛刻和孤高自傲而著称，自恃血统与个人的优越而目空一切，这使得她行事几乎肆无忌惮。根据许多逸闻传言来判断，她这种怪僻性格差不多达到了偏执狂的程度；或者说，假如她的性格所导致的种种行为出自一个心智健全者，那么如此罪孽深重的骄傲按照天意是该招致严酷报应的。许许多多半被遗忘的传说故事就笼罩着这种奇异色彩，而埃莉诺·罗彻克利夫的怪异故事大概也是因此而平添了几分疯狂的野性。

埃莉诺小姐搭乘的船抵达了新港，她再从那里坐总督的马车到波士顿，沿途有一小队骑马的绅士护送。笨重的车身由四匹黑马拉着，隆隆驶过康希尔时十分引人注目，前后簇拥着五六个骑士，胯下的骏马昂首阔步；刀剑在马镫上摇晃，手枪插在皮套子里。队伍奔驶而过的时候，人们能够透过车厢宽大的玻璃窗看见埃莉诺小姐的身影，在她身上妙龄女子的优雅美丽竟与女王般的庄严高贵奇妙地融为一体。一种古怪谣言已经在当地上层妇女中间传开来，说是她们的这位漂亮对手那种无法抵御的魅力大大得益于一件服装——一件绣花斗篷——它出自伦敦最高明的艺匠之手，具有增添美色的魔力。不过，现在她的魅力却丝毫没有借助于这件斗篷的魔法，她身上穿的是一件天鹅绒骑装，别的任何人穿上都只会显得既呆板又粗俗。

车夫勒住他的四匹黑马，整支队伍停在了州府门前，有一道弯曲铁条做成的栏杆把州府和公用街道隔开来。这时发生了一件令人尴尬的事，老南方教堂的钟声正好敲响了一场葬礼的丧钟；结果，埃莉诺小姐没有受到按惯例宣告贵宾到来的喜庆钟声的迎接，却被一阵哀伤的当啷声所导引，仿佛灾难就蕴藏在她那娇美的身影中。

“这是大大的失敬！”兰福德上尉叫道，他是一位英国军官，新近给舒特总督送来了公文急件。“葬礼应该推迟举行才是，免得埃莉诺小姐被这种倒霉的迎接方式弄得心情不快。”

“请原谅，先生。”克拉克博士回答说，他是一位医生，也是民众拥戴的著名斗士。“不论预兆是什么，一个死去的乞丐应该优先于一个活着的女王。死亡之神赐予了至高无上的特权。”

他们一边交谈，一边等着人群让出一条路；州府门前每个方向上都聚满了人，只留出一条通向州府门厅的通道。一个穿着号衣的黑奴从马车背后跳出来，打开了车门；与此同时，舒特总督走下了府邸的台阶，准备扶埃莉诺小姐下车。然而总督庄严的进程却被人抢了先，弄得所有的人都目瞪口呆。有一个面色苍白的年轻人，满头黑发蓬乱不堪，竟然从人堆中冲出来，匍匐在马车旁边，把自己的身体奉献给埃莉诺·罗彻克利夫小姐做下车的踏脚凳。她踌躇了片刻，不过那表情仿佛在疑惑这个年轻人是否配承负她脚步的重量，而并非是不愿意接受一个同类如此可怕的敬意。

“起来，先生。”总督厉声喝道，对着这个莽撞之徒举起了他的手杖，“这狂徒疯疯癫癫的想干什么？”

“不，”埃莉诺小姐调皮地回答说，不过在她的语气中嘲讽多于怜悯，“阁下不要打他。既然有人只想自讨践踏，不给他这种举足之劳的恩惠就太可惜了——况且他也受之无愧呀！”

接着，她就一脚踏上了那个瑟瑟战抖的身体，尽管脚步轻盈得像一道阳光照射在云朵上，同时伸出手来握住了总督的手。埃莉诺小姐保持着这种姿态的时间只有短短一瞬，然而确凿无疑，贵族与世袭骄傲对于人类同情心和天然亲情的践踏，再找不到比这两个人此刻的形象更加适宜的象征了。可是围观者如此为她的美丽所倾倒，而且骄傲对于这样的美人又是如此必不可少，所以他们同时发出了一片热烈的喝彩声。

“这个莽撞无礼的年轻人是谁？”兰福德上尉问道，他这时仍然站在克拉克医生旁边。“要是他神志正常，这么鲁莽就该挨一顿棍子打脚底。如果他是个疯子，就该关起来，免得埃莉诺小姐再遇到麻烦。”

“他叫杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯，”克拉克医生回答说，“一个没有门第和财富，也没有其他优势的年轻人，只有大自然赋予他的头脑和灵魂；他是我们殖民地派驻伦敦代办的秘书，不幸遇见了这位埃莉诺·罗彻克利夫小姐。他爱上了她——她的轻蔑弄得他疯疯癫癫。”

“这么异想天开真是疯了。”英国军官评论道。

“也许是如此。”克拉克医生说，一边皱起了眉头，“不过我告诉你，先生，要是这位趾高气扬地跨进那边府第的小姐不蒙羞受辱的话，我简直要怀疑上天还有没有正义了。她竟然将自己凌驾于人类与生俱来的共有怜悯天性之上。等着瞧吧，看天道会不会以某种方式对她进行惩罚，把她拉到与最卑贱者同等的地位！”

“绝不会！”兰福德上尉愤慨地喊道——“不论她活着还是与祖先同眠，都绝对不会！”

过后没有几天，总督为欢迎埃莉诺·罗彻克利夫小姐而举行舞会。殖民地的首要士绅都受到了邀请，无论远近都是由骑马的信使将请柬送上门，请柬上带有与正式官方公文快件一样的信函封印。大家应邀而至，拥有地位、财富和美貌的来宾济济一堂；州府的大门很少接纳过像埃莉诺小姐的舞会这么众多和显贵的来宾。无须堆砌溢美之词，整个场面可以称之为“壮丽辉煌”；因为依照当年时尚，女士们浑身绫罗绸缎，光彩照人，裙环撑得长裙下摆远远展开；男士们的上衣和马甲都是紫色、猩红色或者天蓝色的天鹅绒，缀着重重叠叠的金钱刺绣，闪闪发光。一套服装中马甲是至关重要的，因为它把一个人包装到接近膝盖，上面绣满了金色的鲜花和叶簇，或许会耗费掉主人整整一年的进项。如今人们的品味已经有所改变——这种品味象征着整个社会制度的深刻变化——所以今天会认为这些豪华艳丽的装束无不滑稽可笑；可是那天晚上客人们都在拼命寻找自己在大穿衣镜里的影像，瞥见自己在闪闪发光的人群中闪闪发光就欣喜若狂。这些贵重的大镜子没有一块保留下了当时场景的一个画面，真是太可惜了，否则那些稍纵即逝的景象本该教给我们多少值得了解和记忆的东西啊！

至少，倘若有位画家或者有块镜子能让我们知道一点儿故事中提到过的那件衣服——埃莉诺小姐的绣花斗篷——那就好了！流言蜚语已经赋予它许多神秘特性，说是她每次只要披上它就会增添一种新的、人们未曾领略过的优美。这固然是毫无根据的奇思异想，但这件神秘的斗篷却给她在我心目中的形象笼罩上了一层凛然可畏的色彩，部分原因在于它传说中的种种价值，部分原因则在于它出自一位垂死的女人之手，说不定那构思的怪异魅力还要归功于死亡来临之际的精神狂乱呢。

在进行过礼节性问候之后，埃莉诺·罗彻克利夫小姐便离开了众宾客，只待在一个小小的显贵人士的圈子中，她对这个小圈子里的人要比对一般人更亲切热情。蜡制火炬的光线明亮地投射到场中，以强烈的对照衬托出光彩夺目的人物与衣饰；但她只是漫不经心地注视着这一切，不时流露出厌烦与轻蔑的神情，其中糅合着她那种女性的优雅，使得听她说话的人难以觉察出这种神情所表明的道德缺陷。她并不是以粗俗的讥嘲态度来看待这个场景，不屑于欣赏小地方对宫廷庆典的拙劣模仿，而是怀着一种更深的轻蔑，因自己精神上的优越而不愿屈尊参加到别人的欢乐中去。不论当晚见过她的人对这场舞会的回忆是否受到后来与她有关的奇异事件的影响，总之他们以后一想起她来就觉得她特别骄狂和做作——尽管当时大家都悄声赞叹她美貌无双，以及那件斗篷给她带来的无法形容的魅力。某些做过近距离观察的人还确实发现，她的脸色随着情绪的高低起落时而像热病似的殷红，时而又转为苍白，有一两次还痛苦而无奈地流露出疲乏无力，仿佛马上就要瘫倒在地上。接着她又神经质地浑身一颤，似乎强打起精神，在谈话中插进几句欢快俏皮却又半带恶意的嘲讽。她的举止与情绪显得如此奇怪，使每一个听她讲话的心智健全的人都感到诧异；再观察她的脸色，那种潜藏不明和不可思议的目光与微笑更是使人困惑，简直令人怀疑她的态度是否认真和神志是否清醒。渐渐地，埃莉诺小姐身边的圈子越来越小，最后只留下了四位先生。其中有兰福德上尉，即前面提到过的那位英国军官；有一位弗吉尼亚的种植园主，他是到马萨诸塞来完成某项政治使命的；有一位年轻的圣公会牧师，他是一位英国伯爵的孙子；最后还有舒特总督的私人秘书，他的讨好献媚已经多少博得了埃莉诺小姐的默认。

在晚会的不同时间，都有身穿号衣的州府仆从穿行于宾客之间，手里托着放有各种点心和法国与西班牙葡萄酒的大托盘。埃莉诺·罗彻克利夫小姐拒绝让香槟酒的哪怕一点泡沫来沾湿她那美丽的嘴唇，她深深坐进一把大马士革缎面的大扶手椅里，显然对这种场面的骚乱刺激或者单调乏味感到厌烦透顶。有那么一刻，她对四周的谈话、笑声和音乐都丧失了知觉，就在此时，一个年轻人悄悄走上前来，跪在她的脚下。他手里端着一只托盘，盘里放着一只雕花银质高脚杯，杯中满满盛着酒。他就像对一位加冕的女王那样恭敬地献上这杯酒，或者说像是一位牧师无限虔诚地向他的偶像奉上祭祀品。埃莉诺小姐察觉到有人碰了碰她的裙子，不禁吃了一惊，她睁开眼睛，看见了杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯那苍白而狂乱的面容和蓬乱的头发。

“你为什么老这样缠着我？”她用没精打采的声音说，不过比她平日准许自己使用的语气要和气一些，“人家告诉我说我曾经伤害过你。”

“上天知道是不是这样。”年轻人庄严地回答说，“不过，埃莉诺小姐，为了报偿那种伤害，如果说有过伤害的话，也为了你的现世与来生的福祉，我请求你喝一口这神圣之酒，再把酒杯传给客人们。这将作为一种象征，表明你不愿脱离人类同情心的环链——无论谁想摆脱这个环链，都必将与堕落的天使为伍。”

“这个疯子是从哪里偷来那只圣杯的呀？”圣公会牧师惊呼道。

这一问把宾客们的注意力都吸引到那只银杯上来，大家认出这正是放在老南方教堂圣盘上的那只杯子，或许杯里满盛着的就是圣酒呢。

“说不定里面下了毒药。”总督秘书半似耳语地说。

“把它灌进这个浑蛋的喉咙！”弗吉尼亚人恶狠狠地喊道。

“把他赶出去！”兰福德上尉叫嚷着，同时粗暴地抓住杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯的肩膀，结果打翻了圣杯，杯里的东西全洒在了埃莉诺小姐的斗篷上。“不管这个家伙是恶棍、傻瓜还是疯子，总之不能容他逍遥自在！”

“先生们，请不要伤害我可怜的崇拜者。”埃莉诺小姐说，脸上浮现出淡淡的、厌倦的微笑，“把他从我眼前弄走，假如你们乐意的话；因为我在心中除了对他的嘲笑以外就什么也找不到了。不过，出于礼仪和良心，我还是该为自己造成的伤害哭泣才合适！”

可是当旁观者试图把那个不幸的年轻人带走的时候，他却挣脱开来，以狂乱而激动的恳切态度向埃莉诺小姐提出一个新的、同样古怪的请求。这个请求不是别的，而是要她脱掉那件斗篷；刚才他要求她啜取银杯中的酒时，她用那件斗篷紧紧地裹住身体，几乎把自己完全包了起来。

“把它从你身上扯掉！”杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯喊道，绞紧双手痛苦地恳求着，“现在也许还不算太晚！把这该诅咒的衣服丢进火里烧了！”

然而，埃莉诺小姐却轻蔑地大笑一声，把褶皱重叠的绣花斗篷一直拉到头顶，这种穿着式样又给她美丽的脸庞赋予了一种全新的容貌，她的脸半遮半掩——似乎属于某个具有神秘性格和意图的生灵。

“再见了，杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯！”她说，“把我的形象保留在你的记忆里，记住你现在看到的这副模样。”

“唉，小姐！”他回答道，语气不再那么狂乱，而是哀伤得像丧钟一样，“我们很快就会再见面的，那时你的脸会另换一副模样——那才是应该藏在我心中的形象。”

他不再抗拒宾客与仆人的暴力行为，他们几乎是把他硬拖出房间，粗暴地把他推出了州府的大铁门。兰福德上尉在这件事上一直非常卖力，就在他返回埃莉诺小姐身边时，遇上了那位医生克拉克博士，他们二人曾在小姐到达之日做过随意交谈。医生远远站在一边，与埃莉诺小姐隔着整个房间的距离，但一直在以敏锐而精明的目光注视着她，兰福德上尉不由得认为他一定发现了什么深藏的秘密。

“看来你到底被这位女王似的小姐的魅力打垮啦。”他说，希望借此引出医生的心里话。

“上帝保佑不是如此！”克拉克医生回答道，庄重地笑了笑，“假如你还明智的话，也会为自己做同样的祈祷。那些拜倒在美丽的埃莉诺小姐面前的人要倒大霉了！不过总督就站在那边——我有些话要同他私下谈谈。晚安！”

于是他朝舒特总督走去，低声对他讲了几句话，声音小得让旁边任何一个人也没有听到一个字，不过总督一直很欢悦的脸色突然一变，表明谈话的内容绝不愉快。片刻之后他就向宾客宣布，由于某种未曾预料到的情况，必须提前结束这场晚会。

接下来的几天里，州府这场舞会为整个殖民地首府提供了一个谈话题材，它本来可能成为持续更久的普遍话题，只是因为发生了一件与所有人利害攸关的事情，才一度将这个话题逐出了公众记忆。那就是出现了一种可怕的传染病，它在当时以及前后很长的时间里常常会杀死大西洋两岸成百上千的人。在我们这个故事发生之时，这种病以一种特殊毒性而著称，其严重性足以在这个国家的历史上留下它的痕迹——用贴切的说法，就是刻下天花疤痕——所以这种病灾的猖獗使得举国上下惊惶不堪。

一开始，这种病并不像其通常的传播方式，似乎只限于上流社会，专门从那些傲慢自大、出身名门、拥有财富的人当中挑选牺牲品，坦然自若地侵入堂皇华贵的卧室，与睡在锦缎卧榻上的人同眠共枕。州府晚会上一些最显贵的客人——甚至包括傲慢的埃莉诺小姐认为不屑一顾的那些人——受到了这种致命疾病的打击。人们怀着有失宽厚的嘲讽情绪注意到那四位绅士——弗吉尼亚种植园主、英国军官、年轻牧师和总督的私人秘书——在舞会之夜对埃莉诺最为殷勤的四个人，最先受到瘟疫的袭击。然而，这场瘟疫继续蔓延开来，很快就不只是贵族阶级独享的特权了。它那通红的烙印不再像一颗贵族饰星或者一枚骑士勋章。它曲曲折折地穿过狭窄而弯曲的街道，钻入低矮、简陋、昏黑的住所，把死亡之手伸向了城镇里的水手、工匠和劳动阶层。它迫使富人和穷人感觉到相互之间的同胞情谊；它在三山之间纵横肆虐，那种凶猛劲简直是一场新的鼠疫。那个威力强大的征服者来啦——那种袭击我们祖先的灾难和恐怖来啦——天花！即使把这场可怕瘟疫看作今天的无牙妖魔，也难以恰当估量它在当时所造成的恐慌。

我们一定记得，我们曾怎样满怀敬畏地目睹亚洲霍乱横行无忌，大步践踏大西洋的一段又一段海岸，像厄运降临在遥远的城市之上，逃窜的居民撇下的只是半座空城。再没有什么比这种恐惧更可怕更残忍了，它使人竟然因担心空气有毒而害怕呼吸，竟然因担心传染疾病而害怕紧握兄弟或朋友的手。紧随着这次瘟疫而产生的正是这种沮丧情绪，它甚至在瘟疫未来到之前就已传遍了全城。人们匆忙地挖掘出坟墓，慌乱地掩埋掉病死者的遗体，因为死者就是活人的仇敌，仿佛死者要拼命将活人拽进自己阴森的墓坑。公众会议都暂时停止，似乎人类智慧最好放弃它的谋略手段，既然超自然的篡位者已经在宫廷官府里登堂入室。假如敌人的舰队正在海岸线上游弋，或者敌军的铁蹄正在践踏着我们的国土，人们大概也会将守土之责托付给祸害了他们的那同一位可怕的征服者，而不允许对他的统治稍加干预。这位征服者拥有一种胜利的标志，那就是一面血红的旗帜，它飘扬在病毒污染的空气中，飘扬在天花瘟疫侵入的每一家的门上。

这样一面旗帜早就招展在州府的大门上方了，因为追溯灾难的起源，这场可怕的瘟疫显然就是从这里开始传播的。进而可以一直追溯到一位小姐的豪华闺房——追溯到傲慢者中的最傲慢者——追溯到那个无比娇美、自以为是天仙胚子的女人——追溯到那个目空一切、竟敢用脚践踏人类同情心的人——追溯到埃莉诺小姐！毫无疑问，传染病毒就潜藏在那件华丽的斗篷中，在舞会上它曾给埃莉诺小姐增添了如此奇异的魅力。它那怪异的光彩是一个垂死女人的谵妄头脑孕育出来的，是她的僵硬手指茹苦含辛的最后遗作，因此那些金线中便织进了厄运与苦难。

这个阴森的传说开始只是悄悄流传，现在则已广为人知。人们激烈地斥责埃莉诺小姐，大声宣称正是她的骄傲与轻蔑召来了魔鬼，正是她与魔鬼共谋带来了这场怪异的灾难。有时候，人们的愤怒与绝望会以苦涩欢乐的面貌出现，只要那面标志瘟疫的红旗在一家又一家的门前升起，大家就会到街头去拍着巴掌高声喊叫，辛辣地嘲讽道：“看哪，埃莉诺小姐又胜利啦！”

就在这些阴郁的日子里，有一天，一个模样狂野的人走近了州府大门；他环抱双臂，站在那儿注视着那面猩红色的旗帜，一阵微风将它突然吹动，仿佛要将它所象征的疾病抛向四方。最后，他攀着铁栏杆爬上了柱子，摘下那面旗帜后便走进了州府，同时举起旗帜在头顶挥舞着。在台阶脚下他遇见了总督，总督穿带着马刺的靴子，斗篷紧裹着全身，显然正要出门旅行。

“讨厌的疯子，你来这儿想找什么？”舒特总督喝道，伸出手杖来护卫自己免受接触，“这儿除了死神什么也没有。回去——不然你会碰上它的！”

“死神是不会碰我的，我是瘟疫的旗手！”杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯喊叫道，一面把红色旗帜高高举起摇动着，“今天晚上，死神和瘟疫会以埃莉诺小姐的模样走遍大街小巷，我必须举着这面旗帜在前面开路！”

“我何必对这个家伙白费唇舌呢？”总督咕哝道，把斗篷拉过来掩住自己的嘴，“他这条贱命何足轻重？反正我们谁也不清楚自己能否再活十二个小时。朝前走吧，傻瓜，走向你自己的毁灭吧。”

他给杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯让开道，后者立刻登上了台阶，可是刚走到第一段楼梯平台，他的肩膀就被一只手紧紧抓住。他气势汹汹地抬头观看，疯狂的冲动使他想要跟对手拼斗并挣扎开来，但在一道平静而严厉的眼光俯视之下他顿感软弱无力，那道眼光具有平息极度狂暴的神奇力量。他所面对的是那位医生，克拉克博士，令人悲哀的职责把他引到州府里来了，而在升平昌盛之时他倒并非是这里的常客。

“年轻人，你来干什么？”他问道。

“我找埃莉诺小姐。”杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯柔顺地回答。

“所有的人都从她身边逃离了。”医生说，“你为什么现在还来找她呢？告诉你，年轻人，连她的看护都在那间致命的闺房门槛边倒毙了。难道你不知道，我们的海岸上从来没有降临过像可爱的埃莉诺小姐这样的灾星？你不知道正是她的呼吸使空气中充满了毒素？你不知道撒播在这块土地上的瘟疫与死亡，正是从她那件该诅咒的斗篷的褶皱里抖落出来的？”

“让我看她一眼！”疯狂的年轻人回答说，神情更加狂乱，“让我看看她，看看她那令人敬畏的美貌，穿着那件撒播瘟疫的华贵服装！她和死神并坐在宝座上。让我跪倒在他们脚下！”

“可怜的年轻人啊！”克拉克博士说，对人性弱点的深刻意识令他动情，甚至此时他的唇边也泛出了一丝讥讽的笑容，“难道你仍然崇拜这个毁灭者，她所制造的邪恶越多，你反而越要用更壮丽的幻想来包裹她的形象吗？人类对压迫自己的暴君历来就是这样。那么，进去吧！我已经注意到了，疯狂具有一种良好的功效，它会保护你免受传染——说不定在那间闺房里还能找到治疗疯狂的药方呢。”

他登上另一段阶梯，推开了一道门，示意杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯进屋去。这个可怜的疯子，大概心中怀着虚妄的幻想，以为他那位高傲的女王正庄严端坐，尽管她像使用妖术似的在自己周围撒播了瘟疫，她本人却丝毫不受影响。毫无疑问，他梦想着她的美丽非但不会有丝毫减色，反倒会增添超凡的光彩。他心中怀着期望，虔敬地轻轻走向医生所站的门边，但一到门槛前又停住脚步，疑惧重重地探视着昏黑的房间里那一片阴暗。

“埃莉诺小姐在哪儿？”他悄声问道。

“叫她一声。”医生回答说。

“埃莉诺小姐！公主殿下！死神王后！”杰瓦斯喊道，朝卧室里前进了三步，“她不在这儿！那儿，那边的桌子上，我看见她曾经戴在胸前的那颗钻石在闪光。那儿——”他打了个冷战——“那儿挂着她的斗篷，一个死去的女人绣进了具有可怕威力的诅咒。可是埃莉诺小姐在哪儿呢？”

在一张支着华盖的卧榻的锦缎帐幔后面，有什么东西动了动；同时还传出低低的一声呻吟。杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯仔细一听，分辨出这是一个女人的声音，正在哀伤地抱怨说口渴。他想自己认识这声调。

“我的喉咙！我的喉咙像火在烧，”那声音咕哝着说，“给我一点水！”

“你是谁？”头脑被击蒙了的年轻人问道，一面走近床边猛地拉开帐幔，“你这些抱怨和哀求是偷了谁的声音，就好像埃莉诺小姐竟然会感知到凡人的病痛？呸！你这病得要死的破烂货，为什么藏在我的小姐的闺房里？”

“啊，杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯，”那个声音说道——在发出声音的时候，那个人形不停扭动，挣扎着要藏起她毁损了的脸孔——“如今别看你曾经爱过的女人！上天的诅咒已经打垮了我，因为我不肯把男人称作兄弟，把女人称作姐妹。我用骄傲包裹起自己，就像披上斗篷一样，藐视人类天生的同情心；因此天道才把我弄成这副惨相，成为可怕的怜悯对象。你报了仇——大家都报了仇——天道也报了仇——因为我就是埃莉诺·罗彻克利夫！”

尽管因为生命横遭摧残毁灭，杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯已陷于疯狂，但精神疾病所产生的恶意，心底潜藏的痛苦，以及遭受冷酷蔑视的爱情，此时都在他的胸中苏醒过来。他对着悲惨的姑娘挥动战抖的手指，爆发出一阵疯狂的欢笑，卧房里激起回响，床上的帐幔也随之震动。

“埃莉诺小姐又胜利啦！”他大叫道，“一切都是她的牺牲品！谁能像她自己那样配做最后的牺牲品呢？”

在自己疯狂心智的某个新狂想的驱使下，他一把扯下那件致命的斗篷，冲出了房间和州府。那天晚上，一支游行队伍高举火把走过街头，队列中段抬着一个女人的塑像，裹着一件华丽的绣花斗篷。杰瓦斯·赫尔威斯昂首阔步走在队列的前头，手里挥舞着那面象征瘟疫的红旗。到达州府对面，众人烧掉了那个模拟像，一阵狂风吹来，刮走了灰烬。

据说从那一刻起，瘟疫就销声匿迹了，仿佛从瘟疫初始到结束，它的威力都与埃莉诺小姐那件斗篷有着某种神秘的关系。至于那位不幸小姐的最后命运，则始终笼罩着一片疑云。不过，有人相信在州府的某个房间里，不时能朦胧觉察到一个女子的身影，龟缩在最黑暗的角落里，用一件绣花斗篷捂住她的面孔。假如此项传说事属真实，这个人除了昔日那位高傲的埃莉诺小姐又能是谁呢？





小伙子古德曼·布朗(1)


小伙子古德曼·布朗在日落时分走出家门，来到萨勒姆村的街道上；他跨过门槛又回过头来，同他年轻的妻子吻别。他的妻子费丝——这名字对她很合适(2)——则把自己漂亮的脑袋探出门外，任风拂弄她帽子上的粉红缎带，朝古德曼·布朗呼喊着。

“心肝宝贝，”她把嘴唇贴近他的耳朵，温柔而又有点伤心地悄声说，“求你等到明天太阳出来以后再去旅行，今夜里就睡在自己床上吧。孤单的女人总是受到那些梦和那些念头的骚扰，有时候对自己都会感到害怕。今夜你就留下来陪着我吧，亲爱的丈夫，一年里我就要这一夜。”

“我亲爱的，我的费丝，”小伙子古德曼·布朗回答说，“一年里夜夜都行，可就是这一夜我不能和你待在一起。我这趟旅行——你是这么叫它的——一去一回必须在现在到明天日出之间完成。怎么，我心爱的、漂亮的妻子，难道你就怀疑起我来了？我们结婚才三个月呀！”

“那就愿上帝保佑你！”费丝说，粉红缎带在头上飘扬，“但愿你回来的时候看到一切平安。”

“阿门！”古德曼·布朗高声说道，“祈祷吧，亲爱的费丝；天色一晚就上床，没有什么会伤害你的。”

就这样他们分了手。小伙子往前赶路，走到教友聚会所旁边要拐弯的时候，他又回头张望，只见费丝仍然忧伤地扬着头看着自己，尽管她的粉红缎带还在飘扬。

“可怜的小费丝！”他心想，因为他感到很内疚，“我真是太可耻了，竟为了这趟差事扔下她不管！她还提到了做梦的事。我觉得她讲那番话的时候满面愁容，好像已有梦境警告过她我今夜是要去干什么事似的。不，不，她要是想到这一点准会丢了命。呃，她真是个神圣的人间天使；过了这一夜，我要紧紧守在她的裙边，跟着她上天堂。”

古德曼·布朗心里有了对未来的这种美好决定，便觉得自己满有理由加快实现目前的邪恶目的。他走上了一条荒凉的道路，林间阴森的树木黑沉沉地围在四周，密匝匝地挤挨着，只容狭窄的小径勉强蜿蜒穿过，随即又在后面将小路封闭起来。整个氛围无比凄清；在这片凄清之中还有一个特殊之处，那就是行路人根本不知道无数的树干背后和头顶上的粗大树枝里面藏匿着什么人，所以他虽然孤单地迈着脚步，却可能正从看不见的一大群人当中穿行。

“在每一棵树后面可能都藏着个恶魔似的印第安人呢，”古德曼·布朗自言自语道；他畏畏怯怯地朝身后张望，又接着说，“要是魔鬼就待在我身旁，那可不得了！”

他扭过头来往后看，在经过了道路的一个拐弯处的时候，又再掉过头来朝前望，这时看见有一个穿着庄重得体的人，坐在一棵老树下面。古德曼·布朗走近的时候，那个人站了起来，同他肩并肩地往前走。

“你来迟啦，古德曼·布朗，”那人说，“我经过波士顿的时候，老南方教友聚会所的钟正好敲响(3)。现在整整过了十五分钟了。”

“费丝让我耽误了一会儿。”小伙子回答道；他的声音有点儿发颤，这是因为他的同伴突然出现的缘故，虽然这并非完全出乎预料。

现在森林中暮色甚浓，而他们两个人所行走的地方暮色更是浓重。只能勉强辨认出第二位旅行者大约有五十岁年纪，看来属于与布朗相同的社会阶层，模样也和他很相像，不过也许神态比外貌更为相似。他们很可能被别人看作两父子。尽管那个年长者与那个年轻人在衣着上同样朴素，举止也同样纯朴，但他却具有一种难以描述的风度，显示出他见多识广，假如出于事务的需要，即使是置身总督的宴席上或者威廉国王的宫廷里也不会局促不安。但他身边唯一引人注目的却是他那根手杖，它很像一条巨大的黑蟒蛇，形体雕镂得十分古怪，看上去就像一条活蛇在扭曲蠕动。这当然是受到暗淡光线的影响而形成的视觉假象。

“嗨，古德曼·布朗，”他的伙伴喊道，“才上路就走得这么慢吞吞的可不成。你要是这么快就走累了，那就拄着我的手杖好了！”

“朋友，”另一位说，慢吞吞的脚步干脆停了下来，“我信守约定到这儿来见了你，现在我倒是想回去了。说到你所了解的那件事，我还拿不定主意哩。”

“是吗？”手握蛇杖的人答道，独自笑了起来，“我们还是继续走吧，一边走一边谈。我要是说服不了你，你就转身回去算了。好在我们在这林子里还走得没多远。”

“太远啦！太远啦！”好小伙子叫道，不知不觉地又继续走起来，“我的父亲从来没有为这种差事到树林里来过，他的父亲也没有来过。从殉教者遇难的日子起(4)，我们这一家子就全是老实人，全是好基督徒，难道我要成为布朗家第一个走上这条路的人，而且是和……”

“是和这样的人同路，你想这样说。”年长者点明了他没说完的话，“说得好，古德曼·布朗！我对你的家庭，就跟对任何一个清教徒家庭同样的熟悉，这可不是随便说着玩的。我帮助过你那个当警察的爷爷，当时他正在萨勒姆街头狠命地鞭打一个贵格会(5)女教徒；在菲利普王之战(6)的时候，你父亲要放火烧一个印第安人的村子，是我递给他一个松脂疙瘩，还是在我自己的壁炉里点燃的。他们是我的好朋友，两个都是；我们曾经好多次顺着这条路高高兴兴地走去，半夜过后又快快活活地回来。看在同他们的情分上，我也乐意同你交朋友。”

“要是真像你所说的，”古德曼·布朗回答说，“我真奇怪他们怎么从来没有说起过这些事情。不过说实话，我也不觉得有什么好奇怪的，因为这种事情只要稍微有点谣传，他们非被撵出新英格兰不可。我们都是向上帝祈祷的人，一心要行善积德，绝不能容忍这等邪恶的事。”

“管他邪恶不邪恶，”握着弯曲手杖的行路人说，“在新英格兰这地方我认识许多人。许多教堂的执事都和我一起饮过圣餐酒；许多市镇的委员都选我做他们的主席；马萨诸塞立法会里的大多数人是我的利益的坚定支持者。总督和我也——不过这些都是国家机密。”

“这是真的吗？”古德曼·布朗叫道，惊异地盯着他那个不动声色的同伴，“不管怎样，我跟什么总督啦议会啦毫无关系；他们有他们自己的道理，像我这样老实本分的庄稼汉可不能学他们的规矩。可是，如果我一直这样跟着你走，叫我怎么去面对萨勒姆村的好老头、我们那位牧师的眼光呢？啊，不管是安息日还是布道日，他的声音都会让我浑身发抖。”

到现在为止，年长者一直在严肃地听他讲，这时不禁迸发出一阵大笑，笑得浑身战抖，连蛇形手杖也仿佛在应和着扭动起来。

“哈！哈！哈！”他大笑了一阵又一阵，随后才控制住自己，“唔，接着说，古德曼·布朗，接着说。不过，请别让我笑死了。”

“好吧，那就马上把事情了结吧。”古德曼·布朗说，心中颇为恼怒，“我的妻子费丝，这件事会伤透她那颗可爱的小心儿的；我情愿让自己伤心。”

“嗯，如果是这么回事，”对方回答道，“你就回去好了，古德曼·布朗。哪怕有二十个像我们前面那个一瘸一拐的老太婆，我也不愿让费丝受到任何伤害。”

他一边说，一边用手杖指着路上行走的一个女人，古德曼·布朗认出那是一位非常虔诚的、被人们奉为楷模的太太。在他年轻时，她就教他教义问答，直到现在她还同牧师和古金执事一起做自己的道德与精神顾问。

“奇怪，真是奇怪，古蒂·克洛伊斯会在天黑时分跑到野地里这么远的地方来。”他说，“不过，朋友，请你准许我在树林里走条近道，把这位女基督徒甩到后面去。她跟你素不相识，说不定会问我是跟谁一道，要到哪里去哩。”

“行啊，”他的旅伴说，“你从树林里走，我还是顺着这条路走。”

于是小伙子折转了方向，不过还是留神观看着他的同伴，只见他顺着道路悄悄往前走，一直走到离那老太婆只隔一根手杖的距离。她却使劲赶自己的路，那飞快的速度对于年纪这么大的人来说真是不同寻常，一边走还一边咕哝着些含糊不清的话——不用说是在祈祷了。老头伸出他的手杖，用那像蛇尾似的末端去碰了碰她满是皱纹的脖子。

“魔鬼！”虔诚的老太婆尖叫起来。

“看来古蒂·克洛伊斯还认得她的老朋友啰？”老头同她打了个照面，拄着他那弯曲的手杖说道。

“啊，是吗，真的是阁下吗？”好老太太叫道，“嗬，的确是您，活像我的老朋友古德曼·布朗，也就是如今那个傻小子的爷爷。不过——阁下您相信不相信？——我的那把长笤帚莫名其妙地不见了，我疑心是那个该上绞架的巫婆古蒂·戈里偷走的，当时我全身正抹满了野芹菜、委陵菜和乌头草的汁液(7)——”

“一定还混合了细面粉和新生婴儿的脂油。”模样像古德曼·布朗的人说。

“啊，阁下您也知道这个配方。”老太婆叫道，一边高声地咯咯笑起来，“这正像我说的，聚会的事全都准备停当了，却没有马儿可骑，我决定自己走着去。他们告诉我说，今夜要介绍一个挺不错的小伙子入会。不过阁下您乐意伸出胳膊来扶扶我吗？这样我们只要一眨眼工夫就能赶到。”

“那可不行。”她的朋友答道，“我不会用胳膊来扶你的，古蒂·克洛伊斯；不过我这根手杖倒是可以借给你，只要你愿意。”

他说着就把手杖扔到了她的脚下，就在那儿，那根手杖似乎突然间有了生命，因为它就是主人曾经借给埃及魔法师的那些手杖中的一根。不过，这件事古德曼·布朗不可能看得很清楚。他先是吃惊地往上翻了翻眼睛，然后再朝地面看，这时已既看不见古蒂·克洛伊斯，也看不见蛇形手杖了，只有他的那个旅伴独自一人在等着他，神态平静得仿佛什么事也没有发生过一样。

“那个老太婆教过我基督教教义。”小伙子说；在这句简单的评论中蕴含着无穷的意味。

他们继续朝前走，同时年长者不断告诫着他的年轻伙伴加快步伐和走直道路，话说得那样妥帖，仿佛并非从他口中讲出，而是从听者的内心自然涌出。就在朝前走着的时候，他折下一根枫树枝来做拐杖，动手剥去上面那些带着湿漉漉夜露的小枝丫。他的手指刚一接触它们，那些枝丫就奇怪地枯萎了，干得就像在阳光下暴晒了一个星期似的。两个人就这样迈步快速前行，一直走到路边一个黑黝黝的大坑旁，古德曼·布朗突然坐到一截树桩上，再也不肯往前走了。

“朋友，”他执拗地说，“我拿定主意了。我不愿为了这差事再往前走一步。就算我以为那个邪恶的老太婆正在上天堂，而她其实是要去见魔鬼，那又有什么关系：我有什么理由要撇下我心爱的费丝跟她走呢？”

“你慢慢就会想通这件事的。”他的伙伴镇静自若地说道，“就坐在这儿歇一歇吧；等到你想走的时候，我的手杖会助你一臂之力的。”

他不再多说什么，只把枫树枝手杖扔给布朗，一转眼就不见了，仿佛消融进了越来越深的暗影之中。小伙子在路边坐着歇了一会儿，对自己颇为赞赏，心想自己在碰见牧师清晨散步的时候良心将多么清白，也用不着去躲避善良的老执事古金的目光了。今夜本来会过得很邪恶的，现在能安安稳稳睡一觉，躺在费丝的怀抱里，那是多么纯洁，多么甜蜜啊！古德曼·布朗正在转着这些高高兴兴、自鸣得意的念头时，却听见路上传来一阵马蹄声。他认为自己还是躲进树林里藏身为好，那个驱使他来到这里的罪恶目的仍然使他感到内疚，尽管他现在已经幸运地迷途知返了。

马蹄声和骑马人的说话声越来越近了，听声音是两位庄重的老人，一边逼近一边在从容地交谈。这片混杂的声音似乎是沿着道路传过来的，离小伙子的藏身处不过几码远。但无疑是因为那个地方夜影深浓，行路人和他们的马匹都无法看清楚。尽管他们的身体擦着路旁的小树枝，但就在他们肯定经过的地方，却不见他们有片刻工夫挡住那一线明亮夜空投下的微弱亮光。古德曼·布朗时而蹲伏，时而踮起脚尖站起，他拨开树枝，壮起胆子把脑袋尽量往外伸，可仍然连一点影子也看不到。这使他心里更加恼火，因为他敢发誓，这种事要是真可能发生的话，那他刚才听到的正是牧师与古金执事的声音，他们安静地骑着马缓步前行，就跟他们通常去参加什么授圣职仪式或者教会会议时一样。这时还听得见骑马人的声音，其中一个停下来折了根树枝。

“如果二者择一，尊敬的牧师先生，”那个像执事的声音说道，“我宁愿错过授圣职的宴席，也不愿错过今晚的聚会。他们告诉我，有些会友要从法尔茅斯或者更远的地方赶了来，另外有些还是从康涅狄格和罗得岛赶来的。此外还有几个印第安巫师，他们都有自己的一套法术，跟我们当中最出色的几乎不相上下。而且，还有一个漂亮的年轻女人要来入会哩。”

“好极啦，古金执事！”牧师庄严而苍老的声音回答道，“让马跑起来吧，不然就要迟到了。你知道，我不到场，就什么也做不了。”

马蹄声又响了起来；两个人交谈的声音在一片虚空中奇怪地回荡，穿过树林一路响过去，而那里从来就没有人们聚会的教堂，也没有任何孤独的教徒在那里做过祷告。那么，两位圣职人士旅行到这片异教徒的荒野深处到底是要去何处呢？小伙子古德曼·布朗脚一软几乎就要倒在地上，只觉得头发晕，心里沉甸甸的，便抱紧了一棵树来支撑住身子。他抬头望着天空，怀疑头顶上是否真的有天国。然而只见一片蓝色的天穹，繁星正在闪闪发光。

“上有天国，下有费丝，我仍然要坚决与魔鬼对抗！”古德曼·布朗喊叫道。

他仰头凝视着那深邃的苍穹，举起双手来祈祷，这时虽然并没有刮风，却有一团乌云急速地掠过天顶，遮住了闪亮的群星。依然能看见一片蓝天，除了头顶正上方那厚厚一团乌云在迅速地朝北方飞去。在空中，仿佛来自那团乌云的深处，传来了一片乱哄哄的可疑的人声。有那么一阵子，他觉得自己辨别出了镇子里乡邻们的声音，有男人有女人，既有虔诚的也有不敬神的，其中许多人他曾在圣餐桌上会过面，也见过另一些人在酒店里滥饮狂闹。转瞬之间，那些声音又变得模糊不清了，他猜想刚才听到的也许只是古老的森林在无风之夜飒飒低语而已。接下来，那片熟悉的话语声又更加响亮地涌起，虽说这种声音白天在萨勒姆村里随时都能听得到，但从来没像现在这样从夜空的云团里传出来。其中还有一个年轻女人的声音在哀哀哭泣，哭声中含有一种莫名的伤悲，像在乞求某种恩惠，似乎为了获得它而伤心欲绝。而周围所有那些无影无形的人，不管是圣人还是罪人，好像都在怂恿她继续哀哭。

“费丝！”古德曼·布朗叫起来，声音里饱含着痛苦和绝望；树林发出的回声也嘲弄地模仿着他高喊道：“费丝！费丝！”仿佛是些神志迷乱的可怜虫正在荒野里四处寻找她。

这饱含悲伤、愤怒和恐惧的喊声穿透了夜空，而那个不幸的丈夫则屏息等待着回答。忽然传来了一声尖叫，随即又被一阵更响亮的含糊人声所淹没，渐渐化为远处的一声大笑，而那团乌云也迅速地飞走了，古德曼·布朗的头顶上又露出了明净寂寥的天穹。不过有什么东西轻轻地从空中飘落下来，挂在了一株树的枝丫上。小伙子一把抓住它，发现是一根粉红色的缎带。

“我的费丝走啦！”他呆滞了片刻之后大叫起来，“人世根本就没有善！罪孽不过是个空名。来吧，魔鬼；因为这个世界全归你啦。”

古德曼·布朗因绝望而发狂，便高声地、久久地大笑起来，然后他抓起手杖继续往前走，步伐是那么快，不像走也不像跑，简直像是在顺着林间小路飞翔。道路变得越来越荒芜和凄凉，越来越难辨路径，最后终于消失了，把他撇在一片黑暗荒林的中央，但他仍然凭着一股将凡人引向邪恶的本能埋头往前冲。整个树林里充满了可怕的声响——树木在吱吱嘎嘎，野兽在狂呼怒嚎，印第安人在高声吼叫；风声有时候像远处教堂的钟声在鸣响，有时候又在这位行路人的四周厉声咆哮，仿佛整个大自然都在轻蔑地嘲笑着他。可是他自己就是这个场面中最恐怖的角色，根本不会在其他恐怖事物面前退缩。

“哈！哈！哈！”古德曼·布朗在风声嘲笑他的时候大声吼叫着，“让我们听听谁笑得最响吧！别想用你的妖术吓退我！来吧，巫婆；来吧，巫士；来吧，印第安巫师；你亲自来吧，魔鬼，古德曼·布朗就在这里。你们还是像他怕你们一样地怕他吧。”

事实上，在这个鬼影幢幢的树林里，没有什么比古德曼·布朗的模样更可怕的了。他在黑黢黢的松林里飞奔着，狂乱地挥舞着他的手杖，时而口中愤激地喷涌出可怕的亵渎神圣的话语，时而放声大笑，使整个树林里的回声也像是四围的魔鬼在大笑着应和他。当他以一个兽性大发的人逞其狂怒的时候，真比他化身为魔鬼还要可怕。这个恶魔就这样一路飞奔，直到看见面前有一片红光在树林间闪动，就像是一片空地上被砍伐下的树干和树条被点着了火，血红的火光在午夜时分映亮了天穹。他停下了脚步，让一直驱动着自己的内心风暴平息下去，这时只听见仿佛有一阵唱赞美诗的歌声，许多人的声音正庄严地从远处起伏而来。他知道这支曲调，那是村里教徒聚会所的唱诗班常唱的一首他很熟悉的曲子。歌声沉重地渐渐低落，拖长为一片合唱，但那不像是人的声音，却像是幽昧荒野中各种声音可怕地融合而成的一片轰隆声。古德曼·布朗叫喊起来；但他听不见自己的声音，他的叫喊声与荒野的叫喊声融为一体了。

在静默的间隙中，他悄悄前行，直到那片炫目的火光整个地映入眼帘。只见像黑森森一道墙似的树林包围着一片开阔的空地，空地的一头矗立着一块巨石，其粗糙而原始的模样像是一座祭坛或布道台。有四棵燃烧着的松树环抱着它，树冠上烈焰熊熊，但树干还没有烧着，就像是在黄昏集会时点燃的四根蜡烛。长在巨石顶端的厚实的叶丛全都着了火，光焰高高地冲向夜空，时明时暗地将整片空地照得通明。每一根悬吊着的细枝和垂挂着的叶穗都燃起了火焰。随着红光的明暗变化，聚集一处的许多教徒时而被照得纤毫毕现，时而消失在暗影中，接着又仿佛从黑影中冒出来，顷刻间将荒凉的树林挤得密不透风。

“一群脸色阴沉的穿黑衣的人。”古德曼·布朗这样说。

他们的确是这样。在这些人当中，忽明忽暗地显现出一些面孔，都是第二天将在地方议会上露面的人物，另一些人则在每个安息日都会站在当地圣坛上虔诚地仰望天国，慈祥地俯视着拥挤的会众。有人断言说总督夫人也在场。至少到场的人中有一些与她很熟悉的贵妇人、社会名流的太太、名声卓著的寡妇和许多老处女，此外还有些漂亮的年轻姑娘，她们战战兢兢地生怕会被她们的母亲认出来。或许是照耀在昏暗荒野上的火光突然闪亮使得古德曼·布朗的眼花了，否则他的确认出了二十来个萨勒姆村教堂中因特别圣洁而著称的教徒。虔诚的老执事古金业已到达，正在伺候那位德高望重的圣人、他的可敬的牧师下马。然而，陪伴着这些庄重、可敬和虔诚人士以及这些教会长者、贞洁贵妇和纯洁少女的，却是些行为放荡的男人和名声败坏的女人，都是些沉溺于卑污恶习，甚至可能犯过可怕罪行的家伙。看到这里好人并不规劝坏人，罪人在圣人面前也毫不羞愧，真是太奇怪了。还有些印第安祭司或巫师混杂在他们的白皮肤仇敌中间，他们常常用那些比任何已知的英格兰巫术更加可怕的魔咒，把自己聚居的森林弄得惊恐不安。

“可是费丝在哪儿呢？”古德曼·布朗思忖着；希望刚一浮现在心头，他就战栗起来。

另一首赞美诗又响起，是一支舒缓而哀伤的曲调，就像在歌颂虔诚的爱，但所配的歌词表达的却是人类天性所能想象出的一切罪行，并且阴郁地暗示着更多的罪恶。魔鬼的箴言对凡人来说真是深不可测啊。颂歌一首接着一首地唱下去；荒野的合唱声也强有力地加入进来，就像一架巨大的风琴奏出低沉的音调。伴随着这可怕赞歌的最后一声轰响，又传来一种声音，仿佛是狂风怒吼、急流奔腾、猛兽号叫，于是杂然不一的荒野中各种其他一切声响，都混合交融到那个向万物之主顶礼膜拜的有罪者的声音之中。那四棵燃烧的松树猛地腾起一股更高的烈焰，在这邪恶集会上空的缭绕烟雾之上，朦胧可见许多可怕的身影与面孔。与此同时，巨石上的火焰也红光迸射，并在它的下部形成一道明亮的拱弧，拱弧中此刻出现了一个人。这个人无论是穿着还是举止，倘若要恭敬地加以评论，都与新英格兰教堂的某些庄重的牧师颇为相似。

“将皈依者带上来！”一个声音在原野间回荡，然后隆隆震响传进森林中。

古德曼·布朗听到这句话便从树林的阴影里走出来，靠近那些会众，因为他自己的内心恶念与这些人产生了共鸣，所以他感到自己对他们怀有一种可憎恶的同胞情谊。他几乎敢于发誓，他那已故父亲的身影正从一圈烟雾中俯瞰着他，点头示意他上前去，而一个依稀带着绝望表情的女人又伸出手来警告他朝后退。那是他的母亲吗？然而，牧师和虔诚的老执事古金抓住了他的双臂，要把他拉到燃烧着的巨石跟前去，他根本没有力气往后退一步，也无法抗拒，甚至连抗拒的念头也不敢有。从那边还过来一个面蒙纱巾的苗条身影，被古蒂·克洛伊斯和玛莎·嘉莉一左一右地引导着。前者就是那个教他教义问答的虔诚导师，后者则得到了魔鬼的许诺要做地狱王后，是个张狂的女巫。在火焰燃成的穹隆之下，站着许多改宗叛教者。

“欢迎，我的孩子们，”那个黑黢黢的人影说，“欢迎加入自己族类的聚会。你们这么年轻就明白了你们的天性和你们的命运。我的孩子们，看看背后！”

大家回头去看；仿佛有一道光焰倏忽闪现，照亮了魔鬼崇拜者们的面目；在每张脸上都阴森森地闪耀着欢迎的笑容。

“那儿，”黑暗的人影继续说道，“全是你们从青年时代就很尊崇的人。你们以为他们比自己更圣洁，一旦拿自己的罪孽来对照他们正派的生活和对天国的虔诚向往，你们就心怀畏惧。然而他们全都在这里来参加我的膜拜会了。我今夜将让你们了解到他们隐秘的行为：那些胡须花白的教会长老们如何对家中的年轻女仆悄声讲着淫荡的话语；有多少女人渴盼着穿上寡妇的丧服，怎样在临睡前给丈夫喝一杯毒酒，让他在自己的怀抱中睡上最后一觉；颔毛未长的年轻人怎样急于继承父亲的财产；如花似玉的闺女们——别脸红，可爱的姑娘们——怎样在花园里挖些小坟坑，请我这唯一的宾客去参加私生婴儿的葬礼。通过你们人类心灵中对罪恶的同情，你们将嗅出所有的地方——无论是教堂、卧室、街道、田野还是森林——都发生过罪行，你们将狂喜地看到整个大地不过是一块罪恶的污渍，是一片巨大的血迹。还远不止这些。你们将看穿每个人心中深藏着的罪恶之谜，那一切邪恶伎俩的源泉，它永不衰竭地刺激起邪恶的冲动，比人的力量——比我最大的力量——所能实际显示的还要多得多。现在，我的孩子们，你们彼此看一看吧！”

大家互相观看；借助于地狱之火点燃的火炬的光焰，那可怜的人看见了他的费丝，妻子也看见了丈夫，都在那亵渎神圣的祭坛前战栗着。

“瞧，你们都站在这里，我的孩子们。”那个人影说道，语调深沉而庄重，几乎因绝望的恐惧而显得忧伤，仿佛他那曾经具有的天使本性(8)还能够为我们可怜的人类感到悲哀似的。“你们信赖彼此的良心，仍然希望美德并非全是梦幻。现在你们算是醒悟了。邪恶是人类的天性。邪恶应该成为你们唯一的欢乐。再次欢迎你们，我的孩子们，欢迎你们来参加自己族类的聚会。”

“欢迎。”魔鬼的崇拜者们重复道，齐声发出绝望而又狂喜的呐喊。

他俩伫立在那里，似乎唯有这一对男女还在这个黑暗世界的邪恶边缘上踌躇不前。巨石上有一个天然形成的凹处，里面装着的是血赤色火光映红了的水吗？是鲜血吗？或者是液体的火焰呢？邪恶的化身在里面浸湿他的手，准备在他们的额头上画下受洗的印记，这样他们便能成为罪恶秘密的分享者，更能意识到别人在行为和思想上的隐秘罪孽，胜于对自己罪孽的了解。丈夫看了看他那苍白的妻子，费丝也看了看丈夫。如果再看一眼，他们就会发现彼此都是何等卑污的可怜虫，都会同样对自己所暴露的罪恶和自己所发现的罪恶不寒而栗！

“费丝！费丝！”丈夫喊道，“仰望天堂，抵抗邪恶！”

费丝是否听从了他的话，他并不知道。当话刚出口，他就发现自己置身于静夜与孤寂之中，只听得咆哮的风声沉闷地穿过森林，渐渐消失了。他的脚绊在岩石上，觉得它又凉又潮；一束悬垂的枝条，曾经整个燃成了一团火，现在却在他的脸颊上洒落冰冷的露水。

第二天早上，小伙子古德曼·布朗慢慢走进萨勒姆村的街道，满心迷惑地四处打量着。仁慈的老牧师正沿着墓地散步，以便增进早餐的胃口和思考他的布道词，在走过古德曼·布朗身边时还向他祝福。他在这位可敬的圣人面前感到畏缩，就像要避开一个该诅咒的恶棍。老迈的古金执事正在家中做礼拜，通过打开的窗户能听见他那神圣的祈祷词。“这个巫师祷拜的是什么神灵啊？”布朗暗自想道。古蒂·克洛伊斯，那个德行卓著的老基督徒，站在她的花格窗前晒着清晨的阳光，正向给她送来一品脱牛奶的小姑娘讲解着教义。古德曼·布朗猛地一把拉开那个小女孩，就像从魔鬼手中救出她来。他转过聚会所旁的拐角，发现费丝正伸出系着粉红缎带的脑袋焦急地张望着，一见他就那样欣喜若狂地蹦跳过来，几乎要当着全村人的面亲吻她的丈夫。然而古德曼·布朗严厉而忧伤地瞪了她一眼，招呼也不打就径直走了过去。

古德曼·布朗只不过是在树林里睡了一觉，做了一个妖巫聚会的怪梦吗？

就算是这样吧，如果你这么认为；不过，唉！对于小伙子古德曼·布朗来说，这个梦却是不祥之兆。从那一夜做过那个可怕的梦之后，他即使没有成为一个万念俱灰的人，也变成了一个冷峻、忧伤、郁郁沉思、遇事多疑的人了。每当安息日，会众们都在颂唱圣诗，他却充耳不闻，因为罪恶的赞歌在大声冲击着他的耳膜，淹没了一切祝福的曲调。牧师站在布道坛上演说，雄辩滔滔，手抚打开的《圣经》，宣讲着我们宗教的神圣真理、圣徒般的生活和荣耀的死亡、未来的福祉或者难以形容的苦难，这时候古德曼·布朗就会变得面色苍白，生怕屋顶会轰然垮塌在这个白发苍苍的渎神者和他的听众头上。他常常在半夜突然惊醒，脱离费丝的怀抱；清晨或傍晚，当全家跪下来祈祷的时候，他会皱眉蹙额，喃喃自语，严厉地瞪视他的妻子，然后转身走开。在他活了很久之后，变成了一具满头白发的死尸，被人们抬进墓地，后面跟着老妪费丝，子子孙孙和许多邻居排成壮观的队列。但人们没有在他的墓碑上刻写任何充满希望的诗句，因为他临死都是阴郁不乐的。

罗杰·麦尔文的葬礼


在印第安战争的几次事件中，1725年保卫边疆的那次远征自然是最富于传奇色彩的，它给人们留下了“洛弗尔之战”的深刻记忆。人们的想象力对于其他某些情况总是低调处理，从而证明那一支小部队战士的英雄主义精神值得大加赞美，他们在敌国领土的心脏地带，与两倍于己的敌人交战。双方所展示的英勇气概都符合文明的英雄主义观念；有几个人的行为，即使是由中世纪骑士传奇加以记载也当之无愧。这一仗尽管对于参战者来说是毁灭性的，其结果对于国家来说却不失为幸事，因为它削弱了一个印第安部落的力量，导致了此后维持了数年之久的和平。历史与传说对这次战斗做了不同寻常的详细记叙；领导由参战边民组成的侦察部队的首脑，也获得了像率领成千上万士兵的胜利领袖那样的军事声誉。下面讲述的事情将告诉你在“洛弗尔之战”结束后实行撤退的几个战士的命运，虽然替换上了虚构的姓名，它们来自人们耳熟能详的老人们的口头传说。




清晨的阳光在树顶欢快地闪耀着，两个疲惫和负伤的士兵就在树下摊开四肢过了一夜。他们那张用干枯的橡树叶铺成的睡床，散落在一块巨石脚下的一小块平地上。这块巨石矗立在平缓起伏的山脉中的一座岗顶附近，而这派山脉使得整个乡间景色变得多姿多彩。这块花岗岩的光滑平整的表面高过两人的头顶十五到二十英尺，颇像一块巨大的墓石。石头的纹理看上去就像是用人类遗忘了的字符刻下的一段碑文。这块巨石周围几英亩土地上全是橡树和其他各种硬木林，它们取代了这个地区常见的松树；紧靠这两位行路人身边，还长着一棵生机勃勃的小橡树苗。

年纪较长的那个人身负重伤，大概使他通夜未能入睡；因为当头一缕阳光刚刚照到最高的树梢时，他就痛苦地爬起来，挺直身体坐着。他脸上很深的皱纹和头上间杂的白发说明他已人过中年；但他那副肌肉强健的身躯要是没有受伤的话，肯定还像青春蓬勃时期一样能吃苦耐劳。现在，只有疲惫和衰竭留驻在他憔悴的脸上；他投向树林深处的绝望目光，也证明他断定自己的生命已经走到了尽头。他接着又把目光转向躺在身边的伙伴。那是个年轻人——才刚刚届于成年——他头枕胳膊，睡得很不安稳，他的伤口所激起的剧痛似乎每一刻都会打破他的睡眠。他的右手紧握着一支滑膛枪；从他脸上的强烈表情来判断，他在睡梦中又返回了激战的情景，他正是那场战斗的少数几个幸存者之一。忽然他发出一声呐喊——他在梦中觉得喊得深沉而响亮——到唇边却化为了含糊不清的咕哝声；即使自己发出的这种微小声音也使他猛然一惊，他突然醒了过来。在意识清醒之后，他做的第一件事就是关切地询问受伤的同伴情况怎样。后者摇了摇头。

“鲁本，我的孩子，”他说，“我们头上的这块岩石满可以给老猎手做块墓碑咧。我们前面还有漫长的狂啸怒吼的荒野；就算我家的烟囱就在这片山地的另一边冒烟，对我来说也没用了。印第安人的子弹真是比我想的更厉害啊。”

“我们赶了三天路，您太累啦，”年轻人回答道，“再稍微歇息一会儿您就会有精神了。您就坐着吧，我到树林里去找些树根、草叶来充饥；吃过东西以后，您靠在我身上，我们一起朝回家的方向走。我相信，有我帮着您，您一定能支持到有一座边疆要塞的地方。”

“我活不了两天了，鲁本，”长者平静地说，“我不想再无益地拖累你，况且你自己也很难支撑得住。你的伤很深，力气也很快会耗尽的；但如果你单独地往前赶路，可能还能保住一条命。我已经没指望了，就留在这儿等死吧。”

“要真是这样的话，我也留下来守着您好了。”鲁本语气坚定地说。

“不，我的孩子，不。”他的同伴回答，“希望你听从一个垂死的人的意愿；你伸手让我握一握，随后就走吧。你以为我在断气的时候想到我也会把你拖死，心里能好受吗？我一直像父亲一样地爱你，鲁本；到了眼下这个时刻，我也应该有点儿父亲的权威才是。我命令你离开，这样我才能死得安宁。”

“难道因为您像父亲一样待我，我就应该留下您独自死去、抛尸荒野吗？”年轻人叫道，“不；万一您的生命真的走到了尽头，我就守在您身边，听您的临终嘱咐。我要在这块巨石边挖个坟坑，如果我也支撑不下去了，我们就埋在一起；如果上天赐给我力量，我再寻路回家。”

“人们无论住在城里还是别的什么地方，”长者说，“总要把死者埋进土里；那是为了避免尸体让活人看到。可是在这里，也许上百年也没有人来过，难道我不可以安息在苍天之下，让秋风刮落下的橡树叶掩盖我的尸体吗？再说还有这块灰白的岩石做我的墓碑，我可以用我垂死的余力在上面刻下罗杰·麦尔文的名字；将来有路人经过，就会知道这里长眠着一个猎手、一个勇士。别再抱着这样的傻念头，白白耽误时间啦，快走吧，就算不为你自己，也该为孤苦伶仃的她着想啊。”

麦尔文在说最后几句话时声音战抖，看得出他的同伴也受到了强烈的震动。这番话使他想到自己除了以无益的死来与同伴共命运之外，还有另一份更不容推卸的责任。我们也不能断言说，鲁本心中这时绝对没有自私之念在侵袭，尽管意识到这一点只会使他更加热切地抵制同伴的恳求。

“在这荒山野岭里慢慢等死多可怕啊！”他叫道，“勇士在战斗中是绝不畏缩的；只要有亲友守在床边，甚至女人也能镇静自若地去死；可是这儿——”

“即使在这儿我也不会畏缩，鲁本·伯恩。”麦尔文打断了他的话，“我绝不是个胆小的人；况且，即使我会害怕，也有比人世亲友更可信赖的上帝来给我勇气。你还年轻，生命对于你来说是宝贵的。你在最后时刻将比我更需要慰藉；等你把我埋进土里，只剩孤单一人，夜幕又降临在树林里的时候，你就该感受到死亡的全部痛苦了，而你现在却是可以逃脱的。你天性慷慨，我不愿怀着自私的动机怂恿你留下来。为了我的意愿而离开我吧，我在为你的平安而祈祷之后，再从容地了此一生，免却人世忧伤的折磨。”

“可是您的女儿——我怎么去面对她的目光呢？”鲁本喊叫道，“她会询问她父亲的命运，而我曾发誓要用自己的生命保护您的生命啊。难道我该告诉她，您和我撤出战场后赶了三天路，然后被我扔在荒野里独自死去吗？在您身边躺下来一起死，不是比安全脱身后对多卡丝说这番话更好吗？”

“告诉我的女儿，”罗杰·麦尔文说，“尽管你自己伤势严重，既虚弱又疲乏，还是领着我踉踉跄跄地走了很多里路，只是在我的恳求下才离开我的，因为我不愿意让自己的灵魂染上你的鲜血。告诉她，在痛苦和危险中你一直忠心耿耿，要是你的生命能够挽救我的话，你是会为我流尽最后一滴血的。告诉她，对于她来说你要比一个父亲更宝贵，我为你们两人祝福，我在临死的时候会看到你们将一起走上一条漫长而幸福的人生道路。”

麦尔文说这番话的时候，几乎从地面上撑起他的身子，他突然迸发的力量和结尾的话语仿佛让荒凉而孤寂的森林也弥漫着幸福的憧憬。可是，等他精疲力竭地瘫倒在橡树叶铺成的床上时，刚才在鲁本眼中燃烧着的火光也随即熄灭了。他感到在这种时刻还想到自己的幸福既是罪过，也很荒唐。他的同伴观察到他神情的变化，便善意地设法哄他离开自己。

“或许我说自己活不了多久只是在欺骗自己，”他接着说，“或许只要得到迅速的救援，我的伤还有可能治好。跑在最前面的人一定把我们打了败仗的消息带到了边境上，搜索队会出发来营救像我们这样的伤员。要是你碰上他们，就带着他们到这儿来，谁能说我就不能再坐到自家的炉火边呢？”

这个垂死的人在设法编造毫无根据的希望时，脸上掠过了一抹哀伤的微笑；不过这番话对鲁本却并非没有产生影响。单单是自私的动机，甚至于多卡丝所面临的孤苦处境，都不足以说服他在这种时刻扔下同伴不管——然而麦尔文的生命或许有救的想法唤起了他的希望，他那乐观的天性振奋起来，几乎认定获得救助的渺茫可能性是确定无疑的了。

“您这话的确有道理，很有道理，希望朋友们离我们不远。”他提高了些声音说，“战斗才刚刚开始，有个胆小鬼连汗毛都没伤着就逃了，他大概一路都在飞跑。听到他带去的消息，边境上每个真正的男子汉都会扛起他的滑膛枪。虽然搜索队不会巡逻到树林里这么远的地方来，但我走上一天也许会碰上他们的。您对我说句真话，”他对自己的动机有所怀疑，便转向麦尔文问道，“假如我是您这种处境，您会不会把我活活扔下不管？”

“已经是二十年前的事啦。”罗杰·麦尔文回答说，他长叹了一声，心中暗自承认这两件事是迥然不同的。——“那是二十年前，我同一个好朋友一道从蒙特利尔附近印第安人的监禁下逃了出来。我们穿越树林跑了好几天，最后被饥饿和疲乏压倒，我的朋友躺倒在地上，恳求我扔下他自己走；因为他知道，要是我留下来，我们两个都必死无疑。我怀着找到救兵的一线希望，用枯叶给他堆了个枕头，然后独自往前赶路。”

“你及时回去救他了吗？”鲁本渴望知道麦尔文下面的话，仿佛这将预示自己是否会成功。

“去了。”麦尔文回答说，“当天日落之前，我就发现了一队猎人的营地。我把他们带到了同伴等死的地方；如今他老当益壮，在远离边境的内地经营着自己的农场，而我却重伤在身，躺在这荒野深处。”

这个事例对鲁本的决定产生了重大影响，此外他还受到自己未能意识到的其他种种动机的潜在驱动。罗杰·麦尔文感到胜利在望。

“好啦，走吧，我的孩子，愿上天保佑你！”他说，“你碰上朋友之后别跟他们一起回来，免得伤势和疲乏弄垮了你；只要能抽出两三个人到这里来找我就行啦。相信我的话，鲁本，你往家里每走一步，我的心就会轻松一分。”然而就在他这样说着的时候，脸色和声音似乎都发生了某种变化；因为说到底，被孤零零地抛在荒野里等死毕竟是件恐怖的事。

鲁本·伯恩对自己的行为是否正当半信半疑，最后还是从地上爬了起来，准备独自上路。首先，尽管这违背了麦尔文的意愿，他采集了一大把草根、树叶，在过去两天里他们就是靠这些东西果腹的。他把这些无济于事的东西放到濒死的人伸手可及的地方，再扫拢干枯的橡树叶堆成一张新的床。接着他又从巨石粗糙破碎的一面爬上它的顶部，把那棵小橡树弯下来，把自己的手巾绑在树顶的枝丫上。这一个谨慎办法倒是颇有必要的，可以指引到这里来的人寻找到麦尔文；因为那块岩石除了它宽大而平滑的正面之外，其他部分都被浓密的矮树遮住了，稍微离远一点就看不见。那条手巾原来是包裹着鲁本手臂上一处伤口的绷带；他在把手巾绑在小树上的时候，心里暗暗以上面沾染的血迹发誓自己一定要回来，不管是来挽救同伴的生命，还是来安葬他的遗体。随后他爬下岩石站立着，低垂着目光，接受罗杰·麦尔文的临别嘱托。

长者凭着自己的经验，详尽地指点年轻人如何穿越茫无路径的森林。他在交代这些事时语气十分平静恳切，就好像在送鲁本去打仗或者参加追猎，自己则平平安安地待在家里，而并非在与此生只能见最后一面的人做最后诀别。可是，在说最后一番话之前，他的坚毅也有所动摇了。

“把我的祝福带给多卡丝，告诉她我最后的祈祷将是为她和你而做的。叫她不要因为你把我扔在这儿而心怀怨愤，”——鲁本的心猛地一跳——“因为假如牺牲你的生命能对我有益的话，你是会将它看得无足轻重的。她在为父亲哀伤一阵之后就会嫁给你；愿上天保佑你们长寿和幸福，愿你们孩子的孩子能守护在你们临终的床头！还有，鲁本，”他又补充道，临终时的软弱终于袭上了他的心头，“等你的伤痊愈了，体力恢复了，要回来一趟——回到这块巨石前，把我的尸骨埋进坟墓，并在墓前做一次祈祷。”

边疆居民对墓葬仪式抱有一种近乎迷信的敬重，这大概来源于印第安人的习俗，他们跟活人和死人都要同样交战。为了安葬那些被“荒野之剑”砍倒的人们，在许多情况下又得牺牲更多生命。因此，在鲁本庄严地许诺将回来完成罗杰·麦尔文的葬礼时，他深深感到这个诺言的重要意义。很明显，麦尔文既然在临别嘱托中说出了他的肺腑之言，也就不再竭力劝服年轻人，不再说只要尽快获得救援就可能保住他的性命了。鲁本心里也十分清楚，他再也见不到麦尔文活着的面孔了。他出于仁厚的天性本来是很乐意留下来的，不管要冒多大的危险，直到死亡的一幕结束为止；然而对生命的欲求和对幸福的希望已经在他心中占了上风，他实在难以抵御。

“行啦。”罗杰·麦尔文听过鲁本的诺言之后说，“走吧。愿上帝保佑你成功！”

年轻人默默地紧握拳头，转过身去，准备离开。他迈开缓慢而蹒跚的步子还没有走出几步，又听见麦尔文的声音在呼唤他。

“鲁本，鲁本。”麦尔文虚弱无力地说；鲁本折回身来，跪倒在垂死者身旁。

“把我扶起来，让我靠在这块岩石上，”他最后这样要求说，“我的脸要朝着家的方向，在你穿越树林的时候也可以多看你一会儿。”

鲁本照同伴的希望改变了他坐的姿势，然后重新开始他孤独的行程。他一开始走得很快，与他的体能并不相符合；因为人们的行为有时候虽然很合乎情理，却也会受到某种内疚感的折磨，正是这种心情使他想尽快躲开麦尔文的目光。可是，他在脚踏林中沙沙作响的落叶走出很远之后，又在狂乱而痛苦的好奇心逼迫下悄悄溜了回来，躲在一棵被连根拔起的大树沾满泥土的树根后面，急切地凝望那个孤独的人。早晨的阳光清朗明亮，大树灌木都呼吸着五月甜美的空气；然而大自然似乎笼罩着一层愁容，好像在对人类的痛苦和哀伤表示同情。罗杰·麦尔文高举双手在热忱地祈祷，一些话语透过树林的寂静一直潜进了鲁本的心房，以难以言说的剧痛折磨着他。那断断续续的语句表明麦尔文正在为他和多卡丝祈求幸福。年轻人倾听着，他的良心或者类似的感情强烈地要求他转身回去，到巨石边去重新躺下。他感到，这个慈爱仁厚却又被自己抛弃在绝境中的人将遭遇多么残酷的命运啊！死神会像一具僵尸那样缓缓逼来，穿越森林渐渐潜到他身边，将它那张苍白的、呆滞的脸孔从树后探出来，一棵又一棵，越来越近。可是假如鲁本再耽搁到日落，他也会遭到同样的命运；况且他要是逃避了这种无谓的牺牲，谁又能责怪他呢？就在他投去临别最后一道目光时，一阵轻风吹动了绑在小橡树上的手巾，提醒鲁本要记住自己的誓言。




重重困难阻碍着负伤的行路人的回家之途。第二天，空中阴云密集，使他无法根据太阳的位置来调整自己的路线；他不知道，自己每次耗费所余无几的体力的结果，都只是离家更遥远了。他那少得可怜的食物来自森林中的浆果和其他野生植物。是的，一群群野鹿不时跃过他身边，山鸡也时时被他的脚步惊得呼地飞起，可是他的弹药已在战斗中耗尽，没有办法去猎杀它们。他为求一线生机而奋力赶路，伤口受到刺激便发炎疼痛，渐渐耗尽了他的体力，并使他的意识也时不时地发生混乱。不过，即使是在神志恍惚之中，鲁本那颗年轻的心仍然顽强地执着于生命，直到他最后完全无法走动了，才最终倒在一棵树下，无可奈何地等待着死亡。

就是在这种境况下，他被一支搜索队发现了，这些人是在最初获得战斗情报后被派出来救援幸存者的。他们把鲁本抬到最近的拓居地，碰巧他自己的家正在这里。

多卡丝怀着古昔时代的纯朴情感守护在受伤情人的床前，以女性心灵和双手所独有的温情抚慰来悉心照料他。在开头几天里，鲁本的记忆昏沉沉地迷失在他所经历过的千难万险中，对于人们向他急切询问的那些不胜其烦的问题，他都无法做出明确的回答。战斗的真实细节尚未传播开来；母亲、妻子和孩子们都无从知晓自己的心爱者是做了俘虏还是被更强大的死神的锁链拘押。多卡丝在沉默中忍受着忧虑的煎熬，直到一天下午鲁本从烦乱不安的睡梦中醒来，似乎比前几次醒来时更清楚地辨认出了她。她看到他的神志已经恢复清醒了，再也克制不了自己关切父亲的焦急心情。

“我的父亲呢，鲁本？”她一开口就问道；可是她的情人脸色的突变却使她打住了话头。

年轻人仿佛因为剧痛而猛地一缩，一阵红潮即刻涌上了他那苍白憔悴的脸颊。他的第一个冲动是想掩住自己的脸，但接着又不顾一切地奋力挣扎着抬起上半身，激烈地说起话来，面对想象中的指控为自己辩护。

“你父亲在战斗中受了重伤，多卡丝；他叫我不要为了他而拖累自己，只是要我把他弄到湖边，他好解解渴然后死去。不过我并没有在绝境中抛下老人，尽管我自己也流着血，仍然搀扶着他；我把一半体力都花在他身上，领着他一道走。我们在一起走了三天，你父亲居然出乎我的意料挺了过来；可是到第四天早上醒来的时候，我发现他非常虚弱、精疲力竭，一步也走不动了；他的生命很快就耗尽了；后来——”

“他死啦！”多卡丝用微弱的声音喊叫道。

鲁本感到自己无法承认，由于对生命的自私爱恋，他实际上没等她父亲断气就匆匆离开了。他不再说话，只是低垂着头；他在羞愧和衰竭的夹击下又倒在病床上，用枕头掩着自己的脸。多卡丝的担心得到了证实，她流下了泪水；不过因为这个打击早在意料之中，所以还不是那么沉重猛烈。

“你在荒野里挖坟埋葬了我可怜的父亲吗，鲁本？”她的这个询问表明了一片至诚的孝心。

“我双手虚弱无力，但还是尽力而为，”年轻人用压抑的声音回答道，“他头顶上有一块高高的墓碑；上天做证，我真愿意像他那样永远安息！”

多卡丝听出他最后的话显得很狂乱，此时也就不再多问；她想到罗杰·麦尔文到底获得了当时情况所允许的适当葬礼，心里也感到好受多了。鲁本的勇敢和孝敬，她都毫无遗漏地对她的朋友们做了讲述；当可怜的年轻人脚步蹒跚地走出病房享受阳光和空气时，人人都在赞美他，他受之有愧，深受痛苦和羞辱的折磨。乡亲们公认说他完全有资格向美丽的姑娘求婚，因为他对她的父亲“至死不渝”；既然这个故事跟爱情无关，我们只需交代一句就够了：几个月之后，鲁本就成了多卡丝·麦尔文的丈夫。在婚礼上，新娘满面娇羞，新郎却脸色苍白。

现在，鲁本·伯恩心中怀着一种难以告人的思绪——这桩心事他不得不小心翼翼地瞒着自己最心爱最信任的妻子。他充满深深的、痛苦的懊悔，当他想要向多卡丝坦露真相的时候，道德上的怯懦又让他不敢开口。自尊心，担心失去妻子的爱，惧怕受到世人谴责，使他无法变更自己的谎言。他觉得自己不该因为抛下罗杰·麦尔文而受谴责。他如果守在那里，无谓地牺牲自己的生命，只会给死者的临终时刻再增加一份毫无必要的痛苦；可是隐瞒事实真相却给原本正当的行为蒙上了一层浓重的罪孽。虽然理性告诉鲁本说他做得不错，但他仍然深深体验到一种巨大的精神恐惧，那正是对犯下隐秘罪行的人所给予的惩罚。他心里会发生某种联想，有时觉得自己简直就是一个杀人犯。许多年里，还有一个念头时时出现在他心中，虽然他明白这个念头纯属胡思乱想，却又无力将它从心头驱赶出去。那是一种像鬼魂作祟般的折磨人的幻象——他的岳父仍然坐在那块巨石下，坐在林中枯叶上面，依然活着，正等待着他去实现自己的诺言。这种心理错觉出现之后又会消失，他也从来没有把它们错当成真实情况；但每当心境宁静清晰之时，他仍然感到自己还有个庄严誓言不曾履行，荒野中还有一具未曾掩埋的尸体在召唤着他。然而，他总是找借口来遮掩推诿，结果始终不能让自己去服从那种召唤。现在再请求罗杰·麦尔文的朋友帮忙去实施拖延日久的葬礼已经太晚了；边疆拓居者特别易于沾染上的那种迷信恐惧，又阻止鲁本单独前往。他也不知道在荒无道路、广袤无际的森林中，到哪儿才能找到那块光滑的、似乎刻有字迹的巨石，下面躺着那具尸体？当时从那里走回来的路，他连一段也记不清了，最后一段路更是完全没有印象。然而，他心中始终有一种冲动，有一种只有自己才听得见的声音，在命令他到那儿去，去履行自己的誓言；他也有一种奇怪的想法，觉得只要自己去试一试，就会被笔直引到麦尔文的遗骨所在的地方。可是年复一年，他并没有服从那个他虽听不见却感觉得到的召唤。难言之隐变成了一条锁链，束缚着他的精神，像毒蛇一样咬噬着他的身心；他变成了一个忧伤、抑郁却又暴躁易怒的人。

在婚后几年的光景里，鲁本和多卡丝那外表看来很兴旺的家境开始出现了一些变化。鲁本仅有的财富是他那颗勇敢的心和两条强壮的胳膊；而多卡丝作为父亲的唯一继承人，则让丈夫做了农场的主人。在往日的耕作方式下，这片农场比边疆大多数农场都更大，收成也更好。然而鲁本却是个管理粗疏的庄稼汉，别的拓居者的田地一年比一年收成多，他的田地的情况却一年比一年糟。同印第安人的休战使人们对农业的兴趣不再那么低落了，而在战争期间人们要一手扶犁一手拿枪，冒险劳作的成果不论长在田里还是收进谷仓，只要不被野蛮的敌人毁掉就算幸运。可是鲁本却没有从条件的改善中受益；无可否认的是，即使他也间或辛勤照料自己的农事，但收成总是很糟糕。他近年来出了名的暴躁性格则是导致家道中落的另一个原因，在与邻居发生不可避免的交往中，他的坏脾气总是经常引发争吵。结果是招来无数的官司；因为新英格兰人在最早的定居阶段，在国家尚处于蛮荒状态下，只要有可能就要采取法律手段来解决彼此的争端。总而言之，鲁本在这世上总是不走运；婚后没过多少年，他终于成了个破产的人，要对抗穷追不舍的厄运只剩下一条路，那就是钻进不见天日的森林深处，到未经垦殖的荒野中去求生存。

鲁本与多卡丝只有一个儿子，如今刚满十五岁，正值美好的青春年华，看得出成年后前途将不可限量。他特别具有边疆拓荒生活的种种才干，而且已经开始显露出过人的能力。他跑起来疾步如风，打枪百发百中，思维敏捷，心地欢乐高尚；所有预见将与印第安人重新开战的人，无论谁说起塞勒斯·伯恩都把他看作这片土地未来的领袖。鲁本深沉地、默默地爱着儿子，仿佛他本人天性中一切美好和幸运的东西都传给了孩子，他所有的感情都凝聚其中。多卡丝虽然可爱，他也爱着她，但在他眼中甚至也远远比不上儿子珍贵。因为鲁本的隐秘和孤独性情已经渐渐使他成为一个自私的人，他已不能再有深沉的爱，除非那是他所看到的或想象出的自己心灵的反射物或相似物。从赛勒斯身上，他辨认出自己昔日的影子；时不时的他也似乎分享到儿子的情绪，重新恢复了鲜活快乐的生命力。鲁本在儿子的陪同下开始了他的远征，打算选择一块荒地，砍伐和烧掉树木，然后再把家搬过去。秋天里有两个月就这样过去了；随后，鲁本·伯恩和年轻的猎手就回拓居地去度过最后一个冬季。

第二年五月初，一家三口割断了与一切毫无生气的东西的感情羁绊，并与几个在厄运中还自称是他们朋友的人告别。对这三位远行者来说，临别之际的哀伤都具有其特定的慰藉作用。鲁本这个喜怒无常的人，因为不幸而愤世嫉俗，像平日一样眉头紧锁，目光低垂，大踏步地朝前走；他并不感到多么惋惜，也不屑于承认有这类感情。多卡丝泪水长淌，因为她纯朴深情的天性对种种事物依恋不舍却又不得不割弃，但又感到留驻在内心深处的东西始终在伴她同行，至于其他的一切则自有天意安排。儿子挥去了眼角的一滴泪珠，心中想的是在渺无人迹的森林中冒险的快乐。

啊，谁不曾在白日梦的激情中怀抱着希望，愿自己在夏日荒野的天地中漫游，手臂上轻盈地挽着个美丽温柔的人儿？在青年时代，他那自由不羁、欢乐跳跃的步伐，除了滔滔翻滚的海洋或白雪封顶的山峦，绝不知道有什么障碍；到了较为宁静的中年，他会选择一处家园，大自然将在明澈小溪流经的山谷中为他安排一块双倍丰饶的土地；待到经历过纯洁生活的漫长岁月，霜色偷偷地染上了双鬓，他这才发觉自己已成为一族之长，儿孙满堂，甚至可能成为一个强大民族的创始者。就像我们度过了幸福的白日将欢迎甜蜜的睡眠一样，到最后，死亡降临到他头上，子子孙孙会守着他可敬的骨灰齐声哀悼。传说将把他包裹在神秘色彩之中，未来的一代代人会说他像天神，渺远的后裔会看见他朦胧显现的雄伟身影，高高矗立在那道万年亘古的溪谷之上。

我的故事中的这一家人艰难跋涉在纷乱而阴暗的森林中，却是与白日梦者的幻境大不相同。不过，在他们的生存方式中蕴含着某种大自然的原始本性，如今只有从世间带来的痛苦烦恼才对他们的幸福构成阻碍。一匹强壮的长满粗毛的马驮着他们的全部家当，即使再驮上多卡丝也不会畏缩；只不过她生来就经受过艰苦磨炼，每天行程的后半段都能支撑着坚持走在丈夫身边。鲁本和儿子肩上扛着滑膛枪，背后挂着利斧，迈着不知疲倦的步伐，各自以猎人的目光搜寻着可充食物的野兽。饥饿的时候，他们就在林间的清溪岸边停下来准备做饭，他们跪下去用溪水湿润干渴的嘴唇，这时溪水会咕咕细语，可爱地表示不大情愿，就像是少女在接受恋人的初吻。他们睡在树枝搭成的窝棚下面，晨光初露之时醒来，精神振奋地迎接又一天的艰辛历程。多卡丝和儿子兴致勃勃地走着，甚至鲁本偶尔也会显出快乐的神情，不过他内心却感到一种冰冷的悲伤，他把这比作小溪穿行的幽谷洼地里堆积得很深的积雪，表面上却覆盖着葱茏蓬勃的绿叶。

塞勒斯对这种林中旅行已是轻车熟路，他发现父亲没有按去年秋天那次远征的路线走。他们现在保持着远向北方的方向，从拓居地出来越来越笔直地朝前奋进，深入到似乎仍由野兽与蛮族主宰着的区域。儿子有时对父亲暗示自己的意见，鲁本很注意地听着。也有一两次按照儿子的意见改变过行进的方向，但他在这样做了之后仿佛有些心神不安。他把锐利而游移的目光投向前方，显然是在搜寻潜藏在树干后面的敌人；他发现树后什么也没有，便又把目光转向身后，仿佛害怕后面有人在追赶。塞勒斯察觉到父亲又渐渐转回了老方向，尽管心生疑窦却又忍着不去干涉他，况且他那喜好冒险的天性也并不反感行程增长和充满神秘。

到第五天下午，他们停了下来，在日落之前一小时左右就安排好了简陋的宿营地。他们最后走过的几里路上景色变化很大，地势就像凝固的海浪一样凸凹起伏。就在这样一片洼地中，在一个荒凉奇崛之地，一家人搭起了窝棚，点燃了篝火。他们想到全家三口被亲情的坚强纽带维系在一处，与外部世界完全隔绝，不免产生某种既令人心寒又使内心温暖的感觉。黝黑阴森的松树俯视着他们，当风刮过树梢的时候，可以听见森林中枝叶振响出一片哀怜声；是不是那些古树在呻吟，害怕有人来挥动利斧最后砍断它们的根？多卡丝做饭的时候，鲁本和儿子打算出去搜寻猎物，当天沿途上还什么也没有捕猎到哩。儿子保证自己不离开营地附近区域，接着就蹦跳着跑开了，步伐轻快而矫健，就像他希望猎杀的一头野鹿那样。父亲凝视着儿子的背影，心头掠过一阵瞬刻即逝的幸福感，然后准备去相反的方向寻猎。这时候，多卡丝坐在用枯枝落叶燃起的火堆旁；这里有一棵多年前被连根拔起的大树，她就坐在那长满青苔的腐朽的树干上。她时不时地看看在火上快要烧得沸腾的水壶，一面翻看着当年的马萨诸塞历书，这本小册子和一本老式黑体字的《圣经》就是他们家的全部藏书了。对于时间流程中年月日的任意分隔，没有谁会比那些与世隔绝的人更加关注。多卡丝似乎觉得有个情况非常重要，提醒说今天正是五月十二日。丈夫猛然一惊。

“五月十二日！我应该记得很清楚的呀。”他喃喃地说，杂乱的思绪一时涌上心头，“我这是在哪儿？我正在往哪儿去？我把他丢在哪儿啦？”

多卡丝对丈夫难以捉摸的情绪早已见惯不惊了，对他这种表现不以为意。她把历书放在一旁，用哀伤的口气对丈夫说话，那语调流露出一颗温柔的心所怀抱的早已冷却和死灭的悲痛。

“十八年前，大概就是这个日子，我可怜的父亲离开了这个世界。在最后时刻，鲁本，幸亏有一只友爱的手臂在扶着他的头，有一个亲切的声音在鼓舞着他的心。从那时起，一想到你对他的忠诚照料，我就感到安慰。啊，一个人在这样的荒山野林里孤零零地死去，那会是多么可怕啊！”

“向上天祈祷吧，多卡丝，”鲁本哽哽咽咽地说——“祈祷上天保佑我们一家三口谁也别孤零零地死去，抛尸于荒野无人掩埋！”接着他就匆忙地走开，留下妻子在阴暗的松林下照管着篝火。

等到多卡丝的话无意之间带来的痛苦不再那么尖锐，鲁本那匆促的脚步也渐渐放慢下来。可是许多乱七八糟的奇怪念头却在心头蜂拥而至；他胡乱穿行着，不像个猎手而像个梦游者，但他虽说自己并没有刻意去留心，但绕来绕去却总走不出营地周围。他的脚步几乎是在不知不觉地兜圈子；他没有发现自己来到了一处树木浓密地带的边缘，但那些树木并不是松树。这儿长的是橡树和其他各种硬木；树根周围簇生着稠密的灌木丛，但树与树之间还留有一点空隙，被干枯的落叶厚厚地覆盖着。一旦树枝摇曳或者树干枯裂发出声响，就仿佛森林正从沉睡中醒来，鲁本就会本能地举起放在手臂上的滑膛枪，朝四面八方迅速而敏锐地张望；当他相信附近大概没有野兽之后，便又会陷入沉思。他反复思忖是什么奇怪的力量把他从预定路线引开，却把自己远远地带进了荒野的深处。他无法深入到自己的动机所潜藏的心灵隐秘之地，便认定有一种超自然的声音在召唤自己前进，有一种超自然的力量在阻止他后退。他相信上天有意要给他一个赎罪的机会；他希望能够找到那堆久未安葬的遗骨；在用泥土掩埋了它们之后，自己心中的坟墓也就会照射进安宁祥和的阳光了。他正想到这里忽然被惊醒，发现距他转圈的地方不远的森林中发出了一阵沙沙的响声。他觉得有什么东西在一片茂密的灌木丛后面动弹着，便以猎人的本能和老练射手的准确举枪射击。一声低微的呻吟告诉他打中了，甚至野兽也会用这样的声音来表达临死的痛苦，所以鲁本并没有留意。就在此刻，是什么突然闯入了他的记忆呢？

鲁本刚才射中的那片浓密的灌木丛紧靠着一片高地的顶部，它们簇生在一块岩石的脚下，岩石的形状和它那个光滑的表面显得颇似一块巨大的墓碑。这个景象就像反射在镜中一样，唤醒了鲁本的记忆。他甚至认出了那块巨岩上的石纹，仿佛是用早被遗忘的文字镌刻下的碑文；一切都没有改变，只是有一丛浓密的灌木遮挡着巨石的下部，假如麦尔文还坐在那儿，也会被遮掩住了。鲁本站在当年最后站立的地方，就在那棵被连根拔起的大树沾满泥土的树根后面，随即又发现了岁月造成的另一个变化。那棵小橡树，他曾经在梢头绑了一条带血手绢作为自己誓言的象征，已经长得又高又壮，虽未进入壮年期，却也枝叶如盖、浓荫广布。这棵树看上去有一处特别的地方，使鲁本感到胆战心惊。它中部和较低处的枝条生机勃勃，树干上也缠满藤蔓一直延伸到地面，但橡树的上部却显然遭受过摧残，顶部的树枝已萎缩、干枯，全都死了。鲁本想起了那条手巾在树梢枝头上迎风招展的情景，十八年前它是那么葱绿可爱。使它枯萎到底是谁的罪孽呢？




多卡丝在两位猎手离开以后继续准备着晚饭。她的林中餐桌是一棵倾覆的大树的长满苔藓的树干，她在树干最粗的地方铺开了一块雪白的桌布，摆放了留存下来的几件亮光闪闪的白镴餐具，这套餐具曾是她在拓居地引以为自豪的东西。在孤寂的大自然心脏地带有这么一个小小的充满家庭慰藉的处所，真是奇特的景象。阳光还在高地生长的树木梢头流连，但在宿营地所在的洼地里暮色已渐深浓；篝火烧得更红了，照亮了松林高高的树干，在环绕空地的浓密阴暗的叶簇之上闪烁着。多卡丝心中并不感到哀伤；因为她觉得与其置身于一群并不关心她的人当中孤独度日，倒不如跟随两个心爱的人在荒野中旅行。她一边忙着摆好两块朽木，在上面铺放树叶，好给丈夫和儿子当座位，一边唱起青年时代学会的一支歌曲，歌声抑扬起伏地荡漾在森林中。这支粗陋的曲调是一位无名歌手的作品，描绘的是冬夜中一所边境茅屋里，一家人安然地避开狂飙积雪的野蛮袭击，待在自家炉火边其乐融融。整首歌曲含有独创构思所特具的那种无以名状的魅力，而四句不断反复的歌词则好像是一片炉火中特别明亮的火光，激情讴歌着他们的欢悦之情。诗人借助几个简单的字词赋予歌曲以魔力，熔铸进了亲人之爱和天伦之乐的精粹，简直是将诗与画融为了一体。多卡丝这样歌唱着，仿佛又重新置身于已被抛离的家园之中；她的眼前不再是那片阴暗的松林，她的耳中也听不见风声，在她每次开始唱一段歌词的时候，风声就像在树枝间发出一声沉重的呼吸，然后在歌声的重压下化为空洞的叹息声渐渐消逝。营地附近的一声枪响猛地惊醒了她；要么是因为突发的枪声，要么是她在篝火边感到孤独，她突然浑身剧烈战抖。接着她又充满母亲的自豪大声笑起来。

“我那出色的小猎手！我的儿子打死了一只鹿！”她想到传来枪声的地方正是赛勒斯出猎的方向，便高声喊道。

她等了一阵子，想来该听见儿子轻快的脚步踏着沙沙响的落叶来报告成功的消息了。可是他并没有立刻出现；于是她发出欢快的声音，在丛林中去寻找儿子。

“赛勒斯！赛勒斯！”

仍然迟迟不见儿子到来；她心想枪声分明距离很近，便决定亲自去寻找他。再说，也许有必要帮忙把鹿肉搬回来，那是她引以为自豪的儿子猎取的啊。于是她动身沿着早已消失的枪声的方向走去，边走边唱着歌，为的是让孩子知道她来了，跑过来迎接她。在每棵大树的树身后，在每丛矮树浓密的叶簇中，她都希望能发现儿子的面孔，正出于爱意而调皮地哈哈大笑着。太阳此刻已落下了地平线，透过树枝投下的余晖十分朦胧，在她满怀期待的想象中制造了许多幻象。有好几次，她似乎隐约看见儿子的面孔从枝叶间向外探望；还有一次，她想象他就站在一块峻峭的岩石脚底在向她点头。然而她定睛一看，结果只不过是一棵橡树，树干上细枝环生一直长到地面，其中一枝比其余的伸得更长，被微风吹得摇摆不停。她绕着岩石脚下走了一圈，突然发现自己就在丈夫的面前，他是从另一个方向过来的。他身子靠着枪托，枪口向下抵着地面的枯叶，看来正全神贯注地打量着脚下的什么东西。

“这是怎么回事，鲁本？你杀了那头野鹿又望着它睡着啦？”多卡丝高声说，她刚一看见他那个姿势和表情就快乐地笑了起来。

鲁本一动也不动，眼光也不朝她这边看一眼；一股不明来源和对象的冷冰冰的、令人战栗的恐惧开始潜入她的血液。现在她发现丈夫的脸色惨白，五官僵硬，仿佛强烈的绝望感使他的表情凝固了，除此之外再也不能有任何其他表情。他丝毫没有显示出自己觉察到她在走近。

“看在上帝分上，鲁本，对我说话呀！”多卡丝大叫道；她自己奇异的声音甚至比死一般的寂静更令她恐惧。

丈夫猛然一惊，瞪着她的脸，把她拉到巨石前面，用手一指。

啊，儿子就躺在那里，睡着了，却不会做梦，就躺在一堆落叶上！他的脸颊枕在一只胳膊上——他的鬈发从额前拂向脑后——他的四肢微微软瘫着。是突然袭来的疲乏压垮了小猎手吗？妈妈的声音会把他唤醒吗？她知道儿子已经死了。

“这块宽阔的岩石就是你亲人的墓碑，多卡丝，”丈夫道，“你的泪将同时洒在你父亲和你儿子的身上。”

她听不见他说的话。带着一声狂厉的尖叫，那似乎是从不幸者灵魂的最深处被逼出来的，她毫无知觉地瘫倒在死去的儿子身旁。就在这一瞬刻，那棵橡树顶部的枯萎树枝在凝止的空气中忽然断裂，化作柔软轻盈的碎片落下，落在巨石上，落在枯叶上，落在鲁本身上，落在他妻子和孩子身上，也落在罗杰·麦尔文的遗骨上。鲁本的心受到猛然一击，泪水像岩间山泉一样迸流而出。当初带伤的青年立下的誓言，由那位受损害者亲自来兑现了。鲁本的罪过赎清了——他身上的诅咒消除了；就在他付出比自己的血更宝贵的血作为代价的时刻，一声祈祷，许多年来的第一声祈祷，从鲁本·伯恩的唇间升向了天堂。





能预言的画像


“这位画家可真了不起！”沃尔特·勒德洛兴奋地喊道，“他不仅在他那门特殊技艺上非常出色，还拥有关于所有其他的学术和科学的广博知识。他用希伯来语同马瑟博士谈话，又对博尔斯顿博士阐述解剖学。一句话，他在自己熟悉的领域里可以同我们当中受过最好教育的人相媲美。此外，他还是一位优雅的绅士——一位世界公民——是的，一位真正的世界主义者；因为他除了能讲我们森林地区的语言而外，讲起地球上任何地区和国家的语言来都像土生土长的人一样，他现在正要去周游世界。所有这一切还并非是我最佩服他的地方。”

“真的！”埃莉诺说，她一直带着女人的兴趣倾听着对这么一位男人的描述，“这就已经够令人钦佩的啦。”

“那是当然，”她的情人回答说，“可是远远比不上他适应形形色色人物的那种天生禀赋，所有的男人——包括所有的女人，埃莉诺——都能在这位了不起的画家身上看见自己的镜中影像。不过，最惊人的地方我还没有告诉你呢。”

“别说啦，如果他还有比这些更了不起的才能，”埃莉诺大笑着说，“这位可怜的先生住在波士顿可就危险啦。你是在跟我说一位画家呢还是巫师呢？”

“说老实话，”他回答道，“你这个问题或许比你所设想的要严重得多啦。人们说他不仅能画出一个人的相貌，还能画出他的思想和心灵。他捕捉到人的秘密感情和情欲，把它们投掷到画布上，就像一道阳光——或者说，如果在心灵阴暗的人的肖像上，就像一簇地狱之火的闪光。这真是一种可怕的才能，”沃尔特把热烈的语调压低，又接着说，“我几乎不敢坐下来让他画像。”

“沃尔特，你这话是当真的吗？”埃莉诺惊呼道。

“看在上帝分上，亲爱的埃莉诺，别让他画下你现在这副表情。”她的情人笑着说，不过笑中含有困惑，“好啦；那种神情现在消失了，不过你说话的时候好像害怕得要死，而且显得非常哀伤。你刚才在想什么？”

“没想什么，没想什么。”埃莉诺急忙回答道，“你在用自己的幻想画我的脸。好啦，明天来叫我，我们一道去拜访拜访这位了不起的画家。”

可是当年轻人离开之后，他的情人的年轻而美丽的脸上又分明出现了那副引人注目的表情。那是一种忧伤而焦虑的神情，与一个少女在结婚前夕应有的心情很不相符。然而，沃尔特·勒德洛又的确是她芳心所属的人。

“表情！”埃莉诺自语道，“假如它所表露的正是我有时内心的感觉，也难怪会让他吃惊了。根据自己的经验，我知道这种表情是多么可怕。不过这全都出于想象。我当时根本就不在意——后来也没有再见过这种表情——我只是梦见过它。”

于是她便忙着做一条绉领上的刺绣，请人画肖像的时候她打算戴上这条绉领。

他们刚才一直谈论的那位画家并不是当地土生土长的艺术家中的一位。那些艺术家生活在比故事发生之时更晚的时代，他们借用印第安人使用的色彩，用野兽的毛发制作画笔。这位画家假如能够召回自己的生命、重新安排自己命运的话，或许也会选择加入这种并无大师的画派，希望自己至少能够展示独创性，因为这一画派既无作品可模仿，也无法则须遵循。可是他却出生在欧洲，受教育也在欧洲。据说他曾经精研过艺术构思的崇高与优美，遍览了悬挂于陈列室和画廊中、描绘在教堂墙壁上的所有著名画作，体悟过出自大师之手的每一处神来之笔，直到再也没有什么可供强有力的大脑学习时为止。艺术已经无法再教给他任何东西，但是大自然却可以。因此，他就去探访艺术同行们从未涉足过的世界，饱览那些至今尚未被移植到画布上去的崇高与美丽的形象。贫乏的美洲不足以对这位杰出的艺术家产生别的任何诱惑，尽管许多殖民地上层人士在画师到来时就表示过希望，想借助他的技艺将自己的形象留给后代子孙。只要有人提出这类要求，他就会用锐利的目光紧盯住请求者，仿佛要把人家里里外外看个透。如果他看到的只是一张圆润柔滑、优裕自得的面孔，那么即使有黄金镶边的套子来装饰画像，又有许多金币作为画资，他也会彬彬有礼地拒绝这件工作和这份酬劳。但是如果他看到的这张面孔显示出某种不同寻常之处，无论是在思想、感情或者经历方面；如果他在街头碰见一个乞丐，长着雪白的胡须和布满皱纹的额头；如果有时遇见一个小孩子碰巧抬头微笑，他就会竭尽自己绝不屈服于金钱的全部技艺来描绘他们。

绘画技艺在殖民地是如此稀罕，所以这位画家也就成了众人好奇的目标。不过很少有人或根本就无人能够欣赏他作品的艺术成就，但在有些要点上众人的见解倒也与业余爱好者的正确评价具有相同价值。画家观察自己的每幅画作在这类缺乏素养的观众身上所产生的影响，并从他们的评论中引出教益，尽管在议论他这个似乎要跟大自然一争高下的画家的时候，他们同时也就想到要对大自然加以指点。必须承认，在他们的赞赏中糅杂着这个时代和这个国家的种种偏见。有些人认为，把上帝创造的这些活生生的形象画出来是对摩西律法(1)的悖逆，甚至是对造物主的放肆嘲弄。另一些人则对画家能够随意唤起幽灵、将死人的形体保留在活人中间感到惊骇，倾向于把画家看作魔法师，或者古老巫术时代著名的魔鬼，换了新的伪装来捣蛋作乱。持有这种愚蠢念头的人竟占民众的半数以上。甚至在上层人士社会圈子里，人们也对他怀着一种模模糊糊的敬畏感，这种敬畏感就部分而言是像烟圈一样从公众的迷信中散发出来的，但主要是由于他的画技能够运用变化多端的知识与才能。

处于结婚前夕，沃尔特·勒德洛和埃莉诺急切地想得到他们的肖像，他们无疑希望让这两幅画像成为未来一系列家庭画像中的第一批。在上述那次谈话后的第二天，他们就去登门拜访画家。仆人领他们进入一套公寓，虽然没有见到画家本人，这里却有不少令他们肃然起敬的人物。他们明白，这些都只不过是画像，但又觉得无法把如此惟妙惟肖的肖像同画中人物的生命与智慧分离开来。好几幅肖像上的人他们都认识，要么是当时的显赫人物，要么就是与他们有私交的熟人。有伯内特总督，就像刚刚收到众议院一份不负责任的通报，正在写一篇措辞尖锐的回复。库克先生就挂在他所反对的统治者旁边，神情坚毅，又有些拘谨，正符合一位民众领袖的形象。威廉·菲普斯爵士的那位老迈的夫人从墙上瞪着他们，她戴着一圈绉领，穿着一件用鲸骨环撑大的女裙——一个傲慢专横的老贵妇，人们还猜测她会巫术。约翰·温斯洛当时还很年轻，满脸洋溢着征战疆场的豪情，多年以后他终于成了一位战功卓著的将军。至于他们的私交，只要望一眼就能辨认。在大多数画像中，人物的心灵和性格都透过容貌表现出来，凝聚为一种独特的神态，因此可以说一句自相矛盾的话，即使画像的原型人物都不如画像那样酷似他们自己。

在这些现代名人当中，还有两位古老的大胡子圣徒，他们几乎消隐进日渐变黑的画布中了。还有一位虽然脸色苍白却容颜不减的圣母玛丽亚，她大概曾在罗马受到过礼拜，现在正用那么温柔圣洁的目光注视着这对恋人，以致他们也渴望顶礼膜拜了。

“想来多么奇怪啊，”沃尔特·勒德洛说，“这张美丽的脸两百多年来一直都这么美！啊，但愿一切美的事物都能如此经久不衰！你不妒忌她吗，埃莉诺？”

“假如尘世变成了天堂，我也许会妒忌，”她回答道，“可是在一切事物都会衰败的地方，做一个容颜不改的人是多么痛苦啊！”

“这个黑黝黝的老头子圣彼得带着一副又狠又丑的怒容，尽管他是个圣徒，”沃尔特接着说，“他让我心烦意乱。不过圣母看来对我们还算和蔼。”

“是的；不过，我觉得她显得很忧伤。”埃莉诺说。

这三幅旧画下面还支着一个画架，上面架着一幅最近才着手的画像。他们稍微察看一下以后，辨认出了他们自己的牧师科尔曼博士的容貌，就像从一片云彩里渐渐演化出了形体与生命。

“慈爱的老头儿！”埃莉诺叫道，“他瞧着我的样子就像要说出一句父辈的忠告似的。”

“而他望着我，”沃尔特说，“仿佛要摇摇头，为了某件猜想中的罪过而训斥我。不过他本人就是这个样子。我们不站在他面前结成夫妻，因为我在他的目光下是绝不会感到轻松自在的。”

就在这时，他们听到了脚步声，回过头来便看见了画家；他进屋来已经有一阵子了，也听见了他们的一些议论。他是个中年人，相貌倒颇值得他自己画上一画。的确，凭着他那身华贵的服装，虽然独具特色但又搭配得漫不经心，或许还因为他的心灵总是留驻在画内人物当中，所以他自己也多少有些像一幅画像了。两位客人觉察到这位艺术家同他的作品之间存在着某种亲缘关系，觉得好像是一位画中人物从画布上走下来跟他们打招呼似的。

沃尔特·勒德洛同画家有几分相熟，便向他解释来访的目的。在他说话的时候，一道阳光正好斜照在他与埃莉诺身上，造成了极为愉悦的效果，似乎使他们构成了一幅青春与美的活画图，而充满光明的未来命运更为此增添了欢快的气氛。艺术家显然深受触动。

“我的画架还要被占用好几天，而且我在波士顿的停留时间也很短。”画家若有所思地说，接着敏锐地看了他们一眼，又补充道，“不过你们的愿望将得到满足，虽说这让首席法官和奥利弗夫人失望。我不能丢失这个好机会，因为能在几厄尔(2)的细平布和锦缎上画画。”

画家表示他打算把两幅肖像融合在一幅画中，描绘他们的某个适宜的姿势。这个计划本来应该让一对恋人感到高兴的，可是他们不得不加以拒绝，因为这么大的画幅对他们打算用这幅画去装饰的那个房间不合适。这样，最后决定画两幅半身肖像。在他们告辞出来之后，沃尔特·勒德洛笑着问埃莉诺是否知道画家将对他们的命运具有怎样的影响。

“波士顿的老太太们都断言，”他接着说，“这位画家掌握了一个人的脸孔和身形之后，就可以按任何动作或任何情境把他画出来——那幅画还能预言未来。你相信吗？”

“不怎么相信。”埃莉诺笑着说，“不过即使他有这种魔力，看他的举止那么温文尔雅，我肯定他也会运用得很正当。”

画家选择了同时进行两幅画的方式，并用他时常使用的那种玄妙莫测的语言提出一个理由，说是两张面孔可以相互映照衬托。于是他时而画一笔沃尔特，时而又画一笔埃莉诺，两人的容貌开始栩栩如生地出现在画布上，仿佛他那臻于圆熟的技艺真能让他们的形象从画布上跳脱出来似的。在那片丰富的亮光和浓重的阴影中，他们看到的简直就是自己的幻影。不过，尽管形象能够完全达到酷似，他们对表情却并不感到十分满意；看来跟大多数画家的作品相比要更模糊一些。然而画家本人却对预期的成功颇为满意，而且因为对两位恋人深感兴趣，他还利用空闲时间，在他们不知道的情况下，为他们画了一张彩色铅笔的素描画。在他们坐着当模特的时候，他总是设法让他们同他谈话，从而在他们的面孔上激发出个性特征，尽管这样一来他们的表情会不停地变化，但他的目的正是要把一切结合起来并固定下来。最后他宣布说，他们只要再来一次，两幅画就可以完成并交付了。

“如果我的笔忠于我的构思，只要再按我的思考添加几笔，”他说，“这两幅画就将成为我最出色的作品。说实话，一个艺术家很少遇见这样好的主题。”

他一边说，一边仍然用他那富于穿透力的目光望着他们，一直目送他们走到楼梯底层。

在人类虚荣心的整个范围内，再没有什么比让人画一幅自己的肖像更能控制想象力的了。为什么会这样呢？镜子也罢，壁炉柴架上光亮的小球也罢，明净如镜的水面也罢，包括所有其他种种能反射影像的表面，都会不断地使我们看到自己的肖像，或者毋宁说看到自己的幻影，但我们瞥上一眼，立即就会忘掉它们。我们所以会忘掉它们，只因为它们会消失。而正是持久的观念——尘世不朽的观念——给我们自己的肖像赋予了如此神秘的兴味。沃尔特与埃莉诺当然不会没有这种感觉，因此他们按照预约的时间准时赶到画家的住处，去迎接那两幅将自己的形象留存给子孙后代的肖像。阳光照耀着他们进入那套房间，但门被关上之后室内却显得有些阴暗。

他们的目光立刻被自己的肖像吸引，这两幅画是靠在房间最远端的墙上的。透过朦胧的光线与距离，他们一眼就看见肖像与自己的惯常姿势和自己所熟悉的神态毫厘不差，不禁同时发出了快乐的惊叫。

“我们就站在那儿，”沃尔特激动地喊道，“永远身披阳光！脸上绝不会有阴郁的神情！”

“是呀，”埃莉诺较为平静地说，“也不会有恼人的变化来使我们忧伤。”

他们一边这样说一边往前靠近，因为还没有把画像完全看清。画家在同他们打过招呼之后，就一直忙着在桌前完成一幅铅笔素描，让客人自己去对他已完成的作品加以品评。他不时从深浓的双眉下投来一道目光，观察他们面容的侧影，这时他的画笔也在那幅素描上静止不动了。就这样，两位客人都在对方的肖像前站了一阵子，用入迷似的专注眼光凝视着，但都一声不吭。最后，沃尔特上前一步——接着又退回去——在不同的光线下审视着埃莉诺的肖像，终于开口了。

“没有一点儿变化吗？”他用疑虑而思忖的语气说，“是的；我看得越久，就越觉得发生了一点儿变化。当然这和我昨天所看到的是同一幅画；这身衣服——这副容貌——一切都相同；可是总有什么地方改变了。”

“那么，这幅画没有昨天那么像她本人啦？”画家这时走过来问道，显示出压抑不住的兴趣。

“埃莉诺的相貌画得无懈可击，”沃尔特回答说，“第一眼望去，神情也跟她一模一样。不过，在我久久观看的时候，总觉得画像上的面部表情改变了。那双眼睛在用奇怪的忧伤而焦虑的目光紧盯着我。不，那是悲痛和恐惧！这像埃莉诺吗？”

“比较一下她的脸和画上的脸。”画家说。

沃尔特斜着目光看了看他的情人，不禁大吃一惊。埃莉诺一丝不动，全神贯注——仿佛着了迷似的——正凝视着沃尔特的肖像，这时她脸上的表情同他刚才所抱怨的分毫不差。就算她在镜子前面演练上一个又一个钟头，也不能如此成功地把握住这种表情。即使这幅画是一面镜子，也不能把她现在的模样映照得更真切更令人抑郁了。她对艺术家和她的情人之间的谈话似乎浑然不觉。

“埃莉诺，”沃尔特惊骇地喊道，“你发生了什么变化啊？”

她没有听见他的话，也没有收回她凝视的目光，直到他一把抓住她的手，吸引了她的注意力为止。这时她才突然一震，从画像转过来望着画中人的脸。

“你没有在自己的画像里看出什么变化吗？”她问道。

“我的画像？——没有呀！”沃尔特回答，同时仔细审视着画像。“不过还是让我看一看！不错，有点微小的变化——我想，是画得更好了，虽然依旧是那么相像。表情比昨天更生动，仿佛目光里闪现出某种欢快的念头，就要从唇间吐露出来似的。我一旦看出了这种神情，它就变得明确无疑了。”

在他目不转睛地进行观察时，埃莉诺回头去看画家。她怀着悲伤和敬畏注视着他，并感到他也以同情和怜悯在回报她，虽然对其中的缘由她只能做朦胧的猜测。

“那种神情！”她悄声说，浑身在战抖，“怎么到画里去的？”

“小姐，”画家忧伤地说，同时握住她的手，把她引到旁边去，“这两幅画中，我所画的都是自己看见的东西。艺术家——真正的艺术家——必须深入到表象之下去探看。这就是他的才能——他最自豪却又常常是令人悲哀的才能——要看到人的心灵深处，并凭借一种甚至自己都无法解释的力量，通过能表达人们长年思想感情的目光，使心灵在画布上光彩焕发或者阴沉暗淡。但愿我能让自己相信，眼前这一例是我的一次失误！”

他们现在走近了那张桌子，桌上的画页里有粉笔画的人头像，有几乎与平常面孔一样富于表现力的手，有爬满青藤的教堂塔楼，有茅草屋顶的农舍，有遭雷电劈击的老树，有东方与古代的服装，以及一位艺术家在闲暇时刻产生的诸如此类的奇思异想。他一页页翻过去，仿佛漫不经心地露出了一张画着两个人像的铅笔素描。

“要是我画得不好，”他接着说，“要是你发现你的心灵没有反映在自己的肖像上——要是你出于什么秘密的原因而不相信我对另一幅画的描绘——现在动手修改它们还不算太晚。我也可以改变画上人物的动作。不过，这样就会对事情的发展产生影响吗？”

他把她的注意力引到了那张素描上。一阵毛骨悚然的感觉袭遍了埃莉诺的全身；她口中差点儿发出一声尖叫；但她克制住了，所有将恐惧与痛苦的思绪深藏心底的人都惯于这样自我克制。她从桌边转过头去，发现沃尔特已经走近得可以看见那张素描了，不过她还不能确定它是否已经引起了他的注意。

“我们不愿再改动那两幅画了，”她急忙说，“如果说我的那幅神情悲伤，那我以后只好显得更快乐些，好与它对照。”

“就这样吧。”画家回答说，鞠了一躬，“但愿你的忧伤都是想象的产物，只有你的画像会因此而悲哀！而你的快乐——但愿它们是真实而深沉的，会画在这张可爱的脸上，直到它证明我的艺术是虚假的！”

沃尔特与埃莉诺结婚之后，这两幅画像就成了他们寓所中最富光彩的装饰品。它们并排地挂在一起，只隔着一块窄窄的镶板，似乎一直在相互凝视着，却又总在回报观看者的目光。游历广泛的先生们熟知这一类绘画题材，认为这两幅画是现代肖像中最值得赞赏的典范作品；普通观众则拿它们同人物原型作比较，将面貌特征一一对比，欣喜若狂地赞叹它的惟妙惟肖。然而只有对第三种人——既非游历广泛的艺术鉴赏家，又非普通观众，而是那些天性敏感的人——这两幅画像才产生了最强烈的效果。这类人开始时会漫不经心地看一看，但在逐渐发生兴趣之后，便会一天接一天地重来这里，像研究一卷神秘的书那样细细琢磨画中人的面孔。沃尔特·勒德洛的肖像最早吸引他们的注意力。当他本人和他的新娘不在场的时候，他们常常会为画家试图在他面部体现的表情进行争论。他们一致同意那是一种意味深长的表情，不过没有哪两个人的解释是相似的。对于埃莉诺的肖像则较少意见分歧。的确，在试图评价她脸上那种阴郁神情的性质和程度时会见仁见智，但大家都同意那就是阴郁，而且与他们的这位妙龄女友的天性迥然相异。某位想入非非的客人竟声称在细加察看之后，结果发现两幅画是同一构思的两部分，埃莉诺脸上那种忧郁的情感力量与沃尔特脸上更加强烈的感情（或者按他的话说，是疯狂的激情）是相互关联的。他虽然并无绘画技能，竟亲自动手画起一张草图来，图中显示两个人物的动作是和他们共同的表情相呼应的。

随着一天天过去，朋友们中间有了悄声议论，说是埃莉诺脸上正笼罩上了一层越来越浓的郁郁沉思的表情，恐怕要不了多久就会使她成为自己忧郁画像的逼真副本了。另一方面，沃尔特不但没有获得画家在画布上赋予他的那种生动神情，反而变得寡言少语、萎靡不振了，不论内心郁积着什么情绪，绝不会流露半分。过了一段时间后，埃莉诺在两幅画像前挂上了一块绣满花朵、缀着粗重金色流苏的华丽的紫色丝帘，借口说灰尘会使画像的色彩灰暗，光照会使画像变得模糊。这就够了。客人们感到这块褶皱重重的丝帘是绝不能拉开的，当着女主人的面也绝不能提起画像的事。

时光流逝，画家又来到这里。他曾经远行天下，到北方去看水晶山那银白色的瀑布，从新英格兰最高的山顶上俯瞰浩瀚的云海林涛。但他并不用自己的艺术模仿来亵渎那些景象。他也曾躺在独木舟中荡漾于乔治湖的怀抱，让自己的心灵像镜子一样映照出它的秀丽与壮观，直到梵蒂冈的艺术收藏品中没有一幅画能比他的记忆更生动。他曾经与印第安猎人一道去过尼亚加拉大瀑布，并在那里再次绝望地把画笔抛下悬崖；他觉得自己倘若能画出汇聚成这大瀑布奇观的种种成分，倒不如说也能画出它如雷的喧嚣声了。事实上，他很少产生描摹自然景色的冲动，除非是为描绘充满思想、激情与苦痛的人的形体和面孔提供一个框架。他以这番冒险漫游所积累的见闻充实了自己：印第安酋长冷峻的尊严神态，皮肤黝黑的印第安少女的妩媚，印第安棚屋内的家庭生活，隐秘无声的行军，阴暗松林里的战斗，边境线上的军营要塞，生于宫廷却老于荒野沙漠的老法兰西党人的变异，这些就是他速写下来的景象和人像。危急关头的激情，狂暴情感的闪现，凶猛力量的搏斗——爱情、仇恨、悲痛、疯狂，总而言之，古老地球上所有疲惫心灵以新的形式向他展示的一切。他的画夹中满是他记忆储存的形象例证，天才将把它们转化为自己的财富，并赋予它们不朽性。他感到自己终于找到了一直在寻求的艺术的深刻智慧。

但是，置身于严酷或可爱的大自然怀抱里，身处于森林险境或它无边的宁静中，始终有两个幻影一路陪伴着他。就像整个身心被某种专注目的缠绕的其他所有人一样，他与人类大众相互隔绝。他没有目标——没有欢乐——没有同情——除了同他的艺术具有终极关系的一切。尽管他的风度举止优雅高尚，意愿与行动正直不阿，但他并不具备慈爱的情感：他的心是冰冷的，没有任何有生命的事物能充分接近他而使他温暖。然而，对这两个人他却发生了最强烈的兴趣，这种兴趣总能使他与他笔下的题材联为一体。他以敏锐的洞察力探究过他们的心灵，并通过自己的最高技巧将其结果绘入他们的容貌中，几乎达到了任何天才也不曾企及的那个标准，也就是他自己严格的艺术观念。他从未来的一片幽暗中捕捉到了——至少他想象是如此——一个可怕的秘密，并将这个秘密隐隐约约地透露在两幅肖像中。他自己——他的想象力和所有其他力量——在研究沃尔特与埃莉诺时耗费的代价是如此之大，以致他几乎把他们视为自己的创造物了，正像他在绘画领域中创造出的成千形象一样。因此，他们真的就在林间暮色中飞掠着，在飞瀑的雾霭中翱翔着，从平滑如镜的湖面上眺望着，也绝不会在正午的阳光下消失。他们时时呈现在他生动的想象中，不是生者的拙劣模仿物，也不是死者的苍白幽灵，而只是借助于肖像的外观，各自带着他用魔法从心灵洞穴中唤醒的那种不变的表情。他在重渡大西洋之前，非得再看一看两幅奇幻画像的原型不可。

“啊，辉煌的艺术！”热情洋溢的画家一边走在街道上一边沉思着，“你就是造物主自身的形象。无数在虚空中游荡的形体，只要你一点头就开始了生命，死去的事物又复活了。你把它们召唤回往昔的情境，给它们灰暗的阴影赋予更美好生命的光彩，使它们既是现世的又是永恒的。你把历史那些飞逝的瞬间夺了回来。对你而言往昔并不存在，因为只要你轻轻一触，一切伟大的东西就永远成为现实；杰出的人物会世代永生，让人目睹他们展示其杰出的行为。啊，威力无边的艺术！既然你能将朦胧显露的往昔带入阳光照耀的狭窄地带，也就是我们所说的现时，那么你能不能召唤隐藏着的未来与往昔同在现时汇聚呢？我还未曾做到这一点吗？难道我不是你的预言家吗？”

就这样，他怀着自豪的却又是阴郁的激情，几乎要高声喊叫起来，一边穿行在令他厌烦的街道上，身边的人们既不了解也不在乎他的白日梦。一个人独自怀着勃勃雄心并不是一件好事情。除非周围还有别的人为他提供榜样以调节自己，否则他的思想、欲求和希望会变得狂放无羁，他本人或许也会真正变成一个疯子。这位画家在以近乎超自然的敏锐洞察力探知别人的心灵时，却没有看到自己心灵的错乱。

“应该是这幢房子，”他在敲门之前先上下看了看建筑的正面，“愿上帝保佑我的记忆！那张画！我想它永远不会消失。不论我是看窗户还是看门，它总是框在里面，笔触浑厚有力，浓重的色彩光芒四射——画像中的两张面孔——素描里两个人的身形与动作！”

他敲门。

“那两幅画像！在里面吗？”他问仆人，接着便镇静下来——“你家主人和太太！他们在家吗？”

“在家，先生，”仆人说，他注意到画家那种无法摆脱的别具一格的模样，又补充道，“画像也在！”

客人被让进了客厅，客厅中间有道门通往大小相同的里间。因为外间空无一人，他就向通往里间的那道门走去，随即看到了两位主人的肖像，也看到了他们本人，这两个人正是他长期以来异常感兴趣的对象。他不自觉地在门口停住了脚步。

他们并未觉察到他的到来。沃尔特与埃莉诺正站在画像前，沃尔特已经把那块华丽宽大的重叠丝帘揭开，一只手抓着丝帘上金色的流苏，另一手紧抱着他的新娘。那幅遮蔽数月的画像再次呈现出它毫不衰减的光彩，似乎在满屋里投射下一道幽暗的光，而不是被外在的光线照亮。埃莉诺的肖像简直具有预言性。一种忧思，接着是一种温柔的哀伤，已经相继留驻在她的面容上，随着时光的流逝而加深，最后化为一种宁静的痛苦。如今倘若再掺进一分恐惧，就酷似画像上的表情了。沃尔特满脸阴郁和呆滞，或者说只偶尔闪现一点活力，随后则因短暂的活跃而变得更加阴沉。他的目光从埃莉诺脸上移到她的肖像上，然后再移到自己的肖像上，最后全神贯注地站在那儿沉思着。

画家仿佛听见命运之神的脚步正从他身后逼近，正在朝它的牺牲者走来。一个古怪的念头猛然跳进了脑海。他自己难道不正是命运体现的形式吗？难道他不就是自己所预示的这场即将到来的灾难的罪魁祸首吗？

沃尔特仍然在画像前面沉默着，仿佛在用自己的心与画像交谈，听任自己接受画家撒播在肖像面容之间的邪恶魔力的摆布。他的双眼逐渐燃起了火光；埃莉诺望着他脸上那越来越狂乱的神情，自己的脸上也泛起了恐惧。待到他终于转身向着她的时候，两个人的面容竟然都与他们的肖像一模一样。

“命运落在我们头上了！”沃尔特号叫道，“死吧！”

他拔出一把刀来，趁埃莉诺往地上倒的时候一把扶住她，把刀对准她的胸膛。在他们的动作中，在他们各自的神情和姿态中，画家看到了他那幅素描中的两个人物。那幅画终于以可怕的有声有色的形式完成了。

“住手，疯子！”他厉声喝道。

他此刻从门边冲上前去，横挡在两个可怜的人中间，觉得自己具有扭转他们命运的力量，就像他觉得自己能够改变画布上的景物一样。他站在那儿就像是一位魔法师，控制着被他召唤来的两个幽灵。

“什么！”沃尔特·勒德洛嘟哝着说，同时从狂热的激奋堕入无声的忧伤，“命运之神会阻挡自己的判决吗？”

“不幸的女人！”画家说，“我不是警告过你吗？”

“你警告过。”埃莉诺平静地回答，她这时恢复了刚才被恐惧扰乱的宁静的忧伤，“但是——我爱他！”

这个故事中不是包含着一种深刻的寓意吗？我们某种行为或所有行为的后果若能被预先显示并摆在我们面前，有些人会把它称作命运，急匆匆地冲向前，另一些人则会被自己的热切欲望席卷而去，没有谁会因能预言的画像而改变方向。

美的艺术家


一位老人，手挽着他漂亮的女儿，正沿街走着。他们从多云的黄昏的暮色中走出来，踏进从一家小店橱窗里投射到人行道上的光明之中。那是一爿向外凸出的橱窗；橱窗里悬挂着各种各样的表，有铜锌合金的，有银质的，也有一两块金质的，表的正面都背对着街道，仿佛吝啬地拒绝告诉路人现在是几点钟了。店内有一个年轻人横坐窗前，苍白的面孔正专注地低俯在一件精巧的机械上方，一盏带罩的灯把集中的光线投射在那东西上面。

“欧文·沃兰在干什么啊？”老彼得·霍文顿喃喃自语道，他本人是一位退休的钟表匠，也是这个年轻人从前的师父，所以很想知道他现在干的是什么活计。“这家伙到底在干什么？这六个月来我每次路过他的店铺，都看见他像这样一动不动地干活儿。这倒是远离了他素来想寻求永恒运动的愚蠢念头；不过我对自己的老行当太熟悉不过了，敢肯定他现在这么忙着的绝不是钟表的什么机械零件。”

“父亲，”安妮说，她对这个问题并没有表现出太大的兴趣，“也许欧文正在发明一种新的计时器呢。我肯定他有足够的独创性。”

“呸，孩子！他那点儿独创性根本做不出比荷兰玩具更好的东西来，”她父亲回答道，欧文·沃兰那种别出心裁的才能一直让他大为光火，“让这种独创性见鬼去吧！我只知道它的全部结果，就是把我店里几块最好的表鼓捣得走不准了。就像我刚才说过的，要是他那种独创性能弄出比小孩玩具更好的东西，那他会把太阳也弄得越出轨道，把整个时间进程也弄得乱七八糟。”

“嘘，父亲！他听见你的说话声了！”安妮悄声说，同时紧紧抱住老人的胳膊，“他的耳朵就跟他的感情一样敏感，你知道他是多么容易动感情。我们走吧。”

于是彼得·霍文顿与女儿安妮停止了交谈，继续朝前走，一直走进镇里的一条小街，经过一家铁匠铺敞开的店门前。店子里面有座锻铁炉，随着皮革风箱巨大的肺吸进和呼出空气的往复运动，时而烈焰腾腾，照亮又高又黑的屋顶，时而火光又只是照亮炉前一小块洒满煤屑的地面。凭借断续的光亮，很容易辨认出店铺远处角落里的种种物件和挂在墙上的马蹄铁；在亮光暗淡的短暂时刻，炉火似乎只在漫无边际的空间中闪耀着微光。铁匠的身影就在这红光闪耀和朦胧昏暗的交替之中不停晃动，这一幅明暗对照的生动图画真是值得观赏，那明亮的火焰在同黑沉沉的暗夜互相搏斗，仿佛每一方都想从对方那里把铁匠的优美力量抢夺过来。不一会儿，他就从炭火中抽出一根烧得白热的铁条，放在铁砧上，举起强有力的胳膊，身影很快就被无数的火星包裹起来，那些火星被他的铁锤敲打得纷纷扬扬地洒落进周围的昏暗中。

“嘿，真是赏心悦目的景象，”老钟表匠说，“我懂得雕琢黄金是怎么一回事；可是说千道万，我还是觉得当个铁匠最棒。他的工夫都花在实实在在的东西上。你说呢，女儿？”

“请别这么大声说话，父亲，”安妮悄声道，“罗伯特·丹福思会听见的。”

“他听见又有什么关系？”彼得·霍文顿说，“我再说一遍，靠花大力气和干实在活儿，靠铁匠的光乎乎的粗壮胳膊挣面包，那是诚实和健全的事情。钟表匠的脑袋却被一个齿轮里再套许多齿轮搅得昏天黑地，要么弄垮了身体，要么损坏了视力，就像我一样，一到中年或者刚过中年就发现自己做不了这个行当了，别的行当又干不了，还穷得不足以过上安心日子。所以我要再说一遍，我宁愿要体力而不要钱。还有，这能够赶走一个人脑袋里的荒唐念头！难道你听说过有哪个铁匠会像那边的欧文·沃兰那么傻头傻脑的吗？”

“说得好，霍文顿大叔！”罗伯特·丹福思从锻炉那边高喊道，声音饱满、深沉而快活，连屋顶都发出了回响。“安妮小姐对这番道理会怎么说呢？她呀，我猜想，会觉得修修小姐的表是比打马蹄铁或者做铁烤架更斯文的行业吧。”

安妮不让父亲有时间回答，就拉着他往前走。

不过，我们还得回到欧文·沃兰的小店去，再花点时间来思考一下他的生活经历和性格，而无论是彼得·霍文顿，或许还有他女儿安妮，或者欧文的老同学罗伯特·丹福思，都会认为这个问题是微不足道的。自打欧文那细小的指头能握住铅笔刀的时候起，他就因心思精巧、富于独创性而引人注目，有时候是用木头雕刻出一些漂亮的小玩意儿，大多是些花儿和鸟儿，有时候则似乎潜心专注于机械中隐藏的奥秘。不过他做这些事总是以美为目的，从来不去仿造实用的东西。他不像学童中的那群巧手工匠，在谷仓的角落上建造小风车，或者在附近的小溪上架小水磨。有的人发现这个孩子与众不同，认为值得花些时间去仔细观察他，常常觉得有理由猜想他是在试图模仿大自然优美的运动，正如鸟儿的飞翔或小动物的活动中所展示的那样。事实上，这似乎是爱美之心的一种新发展，很可能使他将来成为一位诗人、画家或者雕塑家，而且这种素质正如上述任何艺术门类那样的纯美优雅，完全摆脱了功利主义的粗俗气。他对僵化呆板的普通机械运动感到特别厌恶。有一次，人们带他去看一台蒸汽机，期望他对机械原理的直觉理解力能从中获得满足，可是他却脸色发白，感到恶心，好像给他看的是什么畸形怪异的妖魔。这种恐惧心理部分来源于那个钢铁机具的庞大体积和可怕力量；欧文的心灵是显微镜式的，天生就倾向于精细的东西，这与他瘦小的身材和手指的特别细巧精微的力量和谐一致。但这并不意味着他对美的感觉就因此而减弱为一种精致感。美的观念是和体积大小无关的，它可以在广阔的范围内完美地发展，既能小到只有显微镜下才能看清的事物，也能大到唯有横亘苍穹的彩虹才能衡量的辽阔空间。然而，无论如何，欧文·沃兰的审美目标与才能的这种独特的精细性，使得本可能赏识他天才的世人更不能理解他了。孩子的亲属们看不出能有什么更好的安排——或许本来就没有更好的安排——只能让他去跟一个钟表匠做学徒，希望他那奇异的创造力能得到调教，转到实用的目的上来。

彼得·霍文顿对自己徒弟的看法已经表述过了。他对这个孩子也无能为力。的确，欧文领悟起这个行业的奥秘来简直是快得不可思议；但他把钟表匠行当的伟大目标忘得一干二净，或者根本就鄙夷不屑；他对时间的度量毫不关心，哪怕是时间已经融入了永恒。不过，只要欧文还在师父的照管之下，由于他的体格尚不强健，严格的命令和严厉的监管还能将他那创造性的怪癖约束在一定限度之内；但是当他学徒期满，彼得·霍文顿又因为衰退的视力而不得不把小店转让给他时，人们才明白由欧文·沃兰这样一个人每天来给瞎眼的时间老人引路是多么的不合适。他的一项最合理的计划就是给表内的机械联结上一种音乐装置，以便使生活中一切刺耳的不谐和音都能变得美妙动听，使飞逝的每一瞬刻都凝成金光灿烂的圆润水珠，滴落进往昔的深渊中。如果有人把家里的钟交给他修理——那种高大而古老的座钟，因为曾经测量过许多代人的生命而几乎与人性融为了一体——他就会自作主张，在令人肃然起敬的钟面上装配一组舞蹈或送葬行列的小人像，用以代表十二个欢乐或忧伤的钟点。这种异想天开的事要不了几次，就完全破坏了那些四平八稳、讲求实际的人们对年轻钟表匠的信任，他们认为无论是把时间看作今生发达成功的媒介还是对来世的准备，都是不能用来随便开玩笑的。他的顾客迅速地减少了——这是一种不幸，然而在欧文·沃兰看来或许倒是一种可遇而不可求的好运，他现在越来越沉溺于一件秘密的工作之中，它吸尽了他的全部科学知识和灵巧技艺，也使他得以充分展示自己独特的天赋才华。这项追求已经耗费掉他好几个月的时光了。

在老钟表匠和他漂亮的女儿从幽暗的街头凝视过他之后，欧文·沃兰一直感到心绪不宁，手战抖得太厉害，没法继续干自己所从事的精工细活了。

“那就是安妮本人！”他喃喃地说，“在听见她父亲的声音之前，我的心就跳得这么厉害，应该明白是她来了。啊，心跳得多猛啊！我今晚再也无法做这个精致的机械了。安妮！最亲爱的安妮！你应该让我的心和手坚定，不该让它们这样抖动呀。因为，我努力把美的精魂融入形体并使它运动，都是为了你啊。啊，狂跳的心，静下来吧！要是我的工作就这样遭到挫败，会有迷糊而不安宁的梦来搅扰我，使我明天精神不振。”

就在他竭力使自己平静下来重新干活儿的时候，店门打开了，进来的不是别人，正是彼得·霍文顿在铁匠铺的光明与暗影之间驻足观赏的那个壮汉。罗伯特·丹福思带来了他亲手制作的一只小铁砧，那是年轻的艺术家最近特别定做的。欧文细细审视这个物件，说它做得正好符合他的希望。

“嗨，是呀，”罗伯特·丹福思说，他那浑厚的声音就像一把低音提琴响彻了小店，“要说我的这个行当，我觉得自己不输给任何人；尽管我长着这么个大拳头，跟你一比会很难看，”他大笑着说，还把自己的大手放到欧文那只纤巧的手旁边，“可那又有什么？我敲一下大锤所花的力气，比你从当学徒以来花费的全部力气还要多哩。这难道不是事实吗？”

“很有可能。”欧文用低微而细弱的声音回答道，“力气是世间的怪物。我绝不自夸力气大。我的力量，不管它是什么力量，都是属于精神的。”

“好啦，欧文，你在做什么呀？”他这个老同学问道，声音仍然是那么响亮，使得那位艺术家感到畏缩，尤其是因为这个问题关系到一项神圣的使命，那是他的想象迷醉不已的梦境。“人家都说你在设法寻找永恒运动。”

“永恒运动？胡说！”欧文回答道，一面做了个厌恶的手势；他装了一肚子的火气，“它永远也找不到。那不过是一个幻梦，也许会让一些被物质迷了心窍的人上当，我可不会。再说，即使可能有这种发现，如果获得这种秘密的目的只是为了产生蒸汽和水力现在所产生的作用，那也不值得我花费工夫。我并没有野心要想获得什么新型轧棉机之父的荣耀。”

“那可真是够滑稽的了！”铁匠高声说，禁不住放声大笑起来，使得欧文和他的工作台上的钟形玻璃罩都一齐颤动起来。“不，不，欧文！你造出的东西绝不会有钢筋铁骨。好啦，我也不打扰你了，晚安，欧文，祝你成功；如果你需要帮忙，只要是在铁砧上敲一锤子就能做到的，我一定效劳。”

这位体力强健的人又发出一声大笑，离开了小店。

“真是奇怪，”欧文·沃兰悄声自语道，用手撑住头，“我的一切冥想，我的种种目标，我对于美的激情，我所意识到的创造美的力量——一种更精巧更微妙的力量，这个庞然大物对此一无所知——这一切，这一切，只要遇见罗伯特·丹福思就会显得那么虚幻和无聊！要是我经常遇见他，他真会让我发疯的。他那顽固而野蛮的力量总是弄得我的精神暗淡而混乱；不过，我也要坚定地走自己的路。我不会向他屈服的。”

他从一个玻璃罩下面取出一块极其微小的机械装置，放到灯下聚集的光束中，全神贯注地透过一个放大镜观看，接着又用一种精密的钢制工具进行操作。然而，在一瞬间，他的身子猛然倒在椅上，双手紧握，脸上呈现出恐惧的表情，使他那细巧的五官变得像皱眉蹙额的巨人般触目惊心。

“天啊！我干了什么？”他惊叫道，“那种虚幻妄想，那种野蛮力量的影响——它迷惑了我，遮蔽了我的感觉。我终于碰了这么一下——致命的一击——我从一开始就担心会这样。全完了——几个月的心血，一生的目标啊。我被毁啦！”

他坐在那里，陷入了莫名的绝望，直到台灯在插口里闪烁了几下光亮，然后把这位美的艺术家留在一片黑暗之中。

他的种种观念——它们都是从想象中诞生出来的，对于想象而言显得如此美好，其价值远远超越了人们的所有价值观——就这样因与实际相接触而被撞得粉碎、泯灭无存了。理想的艺术家必须具备性格的力量，而这种性格力量与艺术的精致是难以相容的；当怀疑他的世人以绝对不信任的态度对他进行攻击的时候，他必须坚守住自己的信念；他必须挺身而出对抗全人类并始终做自己的唯一信徒，无论对于自己的天才还是对于它所追求的目标来说都是如此。

有一段时间，欧文·沃兰在这种严酷而不可避免的考验面前屈服了。好几个星期里他总是无精打采，一直用两手撑着脑袋，镇上的人几乎没有机会看到他的面容。当他终于抬起面孔对着阳光时，可以看出他的脸上有一种冷漠、呆滞和无可名状的变化。不过，在彼得·霍文顿和那些认为生活应当像铅锤驱动的时钟一样中规中矩的明智之士看来，这种改变完全是件好事。确实，欧文现在对他的生意是勤奋刻苦得多了。人们看到他那么慢吞吞地、一本正经地检查一块古老的大银表的齿轮，不禁颇感惊奇。表的主人欣喜异常，这块怀表放在他的表袋里那么久，已经被视为他生命的一部分，当然很介意它所受到的待遇。欧文·沃兰因此而获得了良好的声誉，结果被有关当局邀请去调试教堂尖塔上的时钟。他在这件关系公众利益的大事上干得十分成功，商人们在交易所里粗声大气地赞扬他的功绩；看护们在给病房送药的时候悄声地表扬他；情侣们因为能按时赴约会而为他祝福；全镇子的人都感谢欧文使得他们能够准时进餐。总之一句话，他精神上虽说压着沉重的负担，却使得一切都井然有序，不仅在他自己的机体内部是如此，所有听得见教堂时钟铿锵作响的地方也都一样。有件事情虽然微不足道，却也颇能代表他目前的状况，那就是顾客要求他在银匙上镌刻姓名或姓名首字母时，他现在尽可能使用最简明的字体，而把此前一直显得与众不同的种种花里胡哨的装饰一概省略。

一天，就在这段愉快的转变期间，老彼得·霍文顿前来探访他从前的徒弟。

“好啊，欧文，”他说，“我很高兴到处听到人们在夸奖你，特别是镇上那口报时钟，一天二十四小时都在称赞你哩。只要完全摆脱掉你那些关于美的废话，那些东西我不懂，别人也都不懂，再说你自己也不懂——只要你从里面解脱出来，那你在生活中的成功简直就像青天白日一样的可靠。嗨，要是你照这个路子继续走下去，连我都敢让你来修理我的这块宝贝老怀表啦；虽说除了我的女儿安妮，这世上就再没有我这么看重的东西了。”

“我连碰也不敢碰它咧，先生。”欧文有气无力地回答道，因为只要当着师父的面他就感觉精神上受到压抑。

“到时候，”师父说，“到时候，你就有本事对付它了。”

老钟表匠带着从往昔的权威中自然产生的随意态度，接着便审视起欧文手头正在干的活儿和他正在制作的其他东西来。那位艺术家这时简直不敢抬起自己的头。再没有什么比师父冰冷而毫无想象力的精明更与他的天性相背离的了，任何东西碰上它都会化作一场幻梦，除非是物质世界中密度最大的材料。欧文的心灵呻吟着，热切地祈祷上帝把自己从这个人手中拯救出来。

“这是什么？”彼得·霍文顿突然大叫一声，拿起一个布满灰尘的钟形玻璃罩，下面露出了一种机械装置，就像蝴蝶的躯体那样精微细小。“这是什么？欧文！欧文！这些小链条、小齿轮和小叶片里藏着妖法。看着！我只要用食指和拇指这么一捏，就把你从未来一切灾难中解救出来了。”

“看在老天的分上，”欧文·沃兰尖叫着，奋力跳了起来，“要是您不想逼我发疯，就别碰它！您的手指只要稍微用点力就会把我永远毁了。”

“啊哈，年轻人！有这么严重吗？”老钟表匠说，他用锐利的眼光盯着欧文，那种充满世俗气的刻薄非难折磨着他的灵魂。“好吧，你干你的吧；不过我要再次警告你，这个小小的机械装置里藏着你的邪恶灵魂。要我把它驱除掉吗？”

“您才是我的邪恶灵魂，”欧文回答道，情绪异常激动——“是您和这个冷酷粗俗的世界！您抛压在我心头的死气沉沉的思想和沮丧情绪才是我的障碍，要不然我早就完成上天赋予我的使命了。”

彼得·霍文顿摇了摇头，既是轻蔑又是愤慨；他所代表的一些人认为自己有权对所有的笨蛋抱着这种感情，那些笨蛋不去拣大道上摆放着的灰尘土块，而总是一心追求别的收获。他随即起身离去，还竖起一根手指头，满脸带着嘲讽，此后的好几个夜晚，他那副神情都一直纠缠着艺术家的睡梦。在他的师父来的时候，欧文差不多正要重新开始他业已放弃了的工作；可是由于这次不幸事件，他又被抛回了自己刚慢慢挣脱出来的原有状态。

然而，在这种表面的呆滞状态中，他心灵的固有倾向却一直在积聚着新的力量。伴随着夏季的进程，他几乎完全停止了工作，听任时间老人——这位老先生至今为止还是由他所控制的钟表充当代表——任意浪迹于人类生活，将无所适从的钟点系列弄得乱七八糟。根据人们的看法，他把大好的白日时光都浪费在树林里、田野上和小溪岸边的游荡中了。他在那里独得其乐，像孩子一样追逐蝴蝶，或者观看水中昆虫的运动。他久久凝视这些活生生的玩物乘着微风游戏，仔细考察自己捕捉到的一只大虫子的组织结构，那份专注简直令人感到不可思议。追捕蝴蝶倒不失为他付出了如此多美好时日去追求的理想的恰当象征；可是那美丽的理想是否会和作为它的象征的蝴蝶一样，被他的手把握住呢？对于这位艺术家的心灵而言，这些日子无疑是既甜蜜又惬意的。其中充满了灿烂的思想，这些思想的光辉照彻了他智慧的天地，就像蝴蝶翩翩闪耀于天空中一样；在此刻，这些思想对他来说就是真实的存在，不会因为试图使它们化为肉眼可见的形体而去劳作、困惑和经历许多失望。唉，可惜无论是借助诗歌还是运用其他素材的艺术家，都不会满足于对美的内心享受，他一定会去追寻那飞翔于他的幻想领域之外的奥秘，要以物质的手段来把握它，从而粉碎了心灵感受的脆弱生命。欧文·沃兰就感觉到那种要给自己的思想赋予外在真实的冲动，这种冲动和任何一位诗人或画家的冲动是同样的无法抗拒，他们对自己梦幻的丰富形态进行并不完美的复制，用一种更模糊、更朦胧的美来装扮世界。

现在，他利用夜晚时分来慢慢地重新实现那项集中了他一切智力活动的计划。他总是在暮色降临的时候悄悄溜进城，把自己锁在店铺里，耐心而细致地干上好几个钟头。有时候，他会被巡夜人的敲门声吓一跳，因为在整个世界都应该沉睡之时，巡夜人却看到欧文·沃兰小店的百叶窗缝隙间漏出了亮光。对于他那处于病态敏感性的心灵来说，白天似乎构成了一种影响他孜孜追求的侵扰。因此，在浓云密布、雨横风狂的日子里，他就独坐在小店里，双手撑着头，仿佛让自己敏感的头脑整个沉浸在朦胧遐想的迷雾之中；因为他在夜复一夜的劳作中总是逼迫自己要把心中的意念鲜明而清晰地予以呈现，这时他便能逃避出来而获得暂时的解脱。

有一次，他正处于这种恍惚状态中，安妮·霍文顿走进店来，惊醒了他。姑娘的态度既像一位顾客那样坦然随意，又带有童年伙伴般的亲密无间。她的银顶针磨出了一个洞，要欧文给修一修。

“不过我不知道你会不会委屈自己来做这样一件小事，”她笑着说，“因为你如今一心想着要把精神输入到机械里去。”

“你这种想法是从哪儿得来的，安妮？”欧文大吃一惊，说道。

“哦，是我自己想的，”她回答说，“很早以前也听你说过这类事情，那时候你还是个小男孩，我还是个小姑娘。好啦，你愿意给我修修这个糟糕的顶针吗？”

“为了你干什么都行，安妮，”欧文·沃兰说——“什么都行，哪怕是到罗伯特·丹福恩的炉子前去打铁。”

“那个样子可好看啦！”安妮回应道，带着难以觉察的轻蔑瞥了一眼艺术家那瘦小单薄的身子，“呃，顶针在这儿！”

“你那种想法真是奇怪，”欧文说，“那种使物质精神化的想法。”

他接着暗暗产生了一个念头，觉得这个年轻姑娘具有一种天生才能，比世上任何人都更能理解他的心思。假如他能获得唯一所爱的人的同情，那么在他孤单苦斗的时候将得到怎样的帮助和力量啊！那些与芸芸众生的追求迥然不同的人们——他们要么超越于世人之前，要么与世人隔绝——常常会有一种寒彻心脾的感觉，足以令灵魂战栗，仿佛置身于北极周围冰封雪冻的荒凉地带。先知、诗人、改革家、罪犯，或者任何怀有人的渴望却又因特殊命运而与世人隔绝的人，他们可能体验到的感情，可怜的欧文也体验到了。

“安妮，”他叫道，内心的念头使他脸色变得惨白，“我多么乐意把我追求的秘密告诉你啊！我想，只有你，才能正确地评价它。我知道，你听见它的时候一定会心怀敬重，而我绝不能指望苛刻而卑俗的世人会这样。”

“难道不是吗？我肯定会这样的！”安妮·霍文顿回答说，同时快活地笑起来，“好啦，快给我解释一下这个小陀螺是干什么用的，它做得这么精致，简直可以给麦布女王(1)做玩具了。看呀！我可以让它动起来。”

“别动！”欧文大叫道，“别动！”

安妮只不过拿起了一根针，用针尖极轻地碰了碰我们已经不止一次提到过的那个复杂机械的微小部件，艺术家就猛地一把抓住了她的手腕，用力之大竟使安妮尖叫起来。狂怒与痛苦的痉挛扭曲了他的面孔，使安妮非常惊骇。接着他低垂下头，双手掩面。

“走吧，安妮，”他喃喃地说，“是我欺骗了自己，应该自作自受。我渴望同情，我以为、我相信、我梦想你会给我同情；可是你并没有进入我的秘密之门的钥匙，安妮。刚才你那一碰已经毁了我好几个月的心血和一辈子的思考！这不是你的错，安妮；可是你毁了我！”

可怜的欧文·沃兰！他确实犯了错，但又应当原谅；因为如果有谁的心灵能对他眼中如此神圣的事业怀有足够敬重的话，那应该是位女性的心灵。即使说安妮·霍文顿吧，假如她对爱情的深邃信息有所知晓的话，也可能并不会令他失望的。

接下来的那个冬天里，艺术家的生活方式令所有一直预期他无可救药的人们甚为满意，事实证明他对于这个世界而言注定是个废物，而他本人也注定该遭厄运。一位亲戚的过世使他获得了一笔小小的遗产。这样他就不必再为谋生而操劳，而且因为失去了伟大目标的恒定影响——这个目标至少对他来说是伟大的——他便放纵于某些嗜好，而这些嗜好据说能有助于支持他那纤弱的体质。然而，当天才人物身上的超凡成分一旦被掩蔽，世俗成分便会发挥更加难以控制的影响力，因为他的性格脱离了上天精心调适的平衡，而在生性鄙俗的人身上，这种平衡是借助于别的某种办法来维持的。欧文·沃兰以自身来证明了狂饮闹宴中可以寻找到怎样的欢乐。他透过杯中金色的酒浆来看世界，凝视着伴随杯沿欢快的泡沫而升腾起的种种幻景，这些幻景使空中充溢着欢乐得疯狂的各色形影，但很快就又变得幽灵般缥缈和空虚凄凉。即使发生了这种令人沮丧而又不可避免的变化，年轻人却仍要继续举杯痛饮这迷人心魂的酒浆，尽管那虚幻的作用会给生命罩上阴影，阴影中又充满了嘲弄他的幽灵。其实这乃是心灵深处的某种厌倦感，这才是真实的，也是艺术家现在所深刻感受到的；它比纵情狂饮所唤起的任何虚幻的悲愁与恐惧都更难忍受。在纵情狂饮之时，即使他心中充满烦恼，尚能记起一切都只是幻觉；而在厌倦心理下，沉重的痛苦就是他的实际人生。

一桩偶发事件把他从这种危险状态中解救了出来，不止一个人目睹了那件事，但其中最精明的人也无法解释或猜想它在欧文·沃兰心灵中发生了怎样的作用。事情非常简单。在春季一个温暖的下午，艺术家坐在寻欢作乐的伙伴群中，面前放着一杯酒，这时忽然有一只色彩斑斓的蝴蝶飞进了敞开的窗户，在他头顶上翩翩起舞。

“啊，”一直在开怀畅饮的欧文叫了一声，“太阳的儿子和夏风的玩伴，你在阴沉的冬眠之后又复活了吗？那么，这也是该我动手干活儿的时候了！”

接着，他把尚未喝干的酒杯留在桌子上，转身离去，从此再也没有听说他沾过一滴酒。

现在，他又重新在树林间和田野上游荡起来。我们可以想象，当欧文同那些粗俗的寻欢作乐者们坐在一起的时候，那只像精灵般飞进窗户的斑斓蝴蝶真是一个精灵，前来召唤他重返他那超凡脱俗的纯洁而理想的生活。我们也可以想象，他是为了寻找这个精灵而到它时常出没的阳光灿烂之地去的；因为在夏天逐渐逝去时，人们仍然看见他轻轻潜行到一只蝴蝶降落的地方，出神地凝视着它。当它飞起来的时候，他的目光也追随着它扇动的翅膀，仿佛它在空中的轨迹指引着登上天堂的路径。不过，巡夜人看到从欧文·沃兰的百叶窗里透出的缕缕灯光，就明白他又恢复了没日没夜的劳作，那又是出于什么目的呢？镇中居民对这一切古怪现象有个无所不包的解释：欧文·沃兰疯了！采用这种方便的办法来说明任何超越世间平庸见解的事情，对于那些头脑狭隘而迟钝的人们来说是多么的百试不爽——多么的称心如意——对他们受伤害的感情来说又是何等的安慰！从圣保罗(2)时代直到我们这位可怜的小小的美的艺术家，这同一个法宝被用来对付那些言行富于智慧和道德的人们，解释他们的话语和行为中一切神秘莫解的地方。就欧文·沃兰的情况而言，镇里居民们的判断也许是正确的。他大概真是疯了。由于缺乏同情——他与邻人们之间的悬殊差别使得规范的约束不复存在——这已足以使他发疯了。也有可能是他受到了那么多超凡光华的照射，这种光华又与普通日光相混合，按照世俗的说法就弄得他神志迷乱了。

一天晚间，艺术家在习惯性的漫游后回家，打开台灯照亮那个精巧的机件；这项工作经常被打断，但仍然再次继续，仿佛他的命运就蕴含在那个机件之中。这时老彼得·霍文顿突然进来了，使他吃了一惊。欧文每次见到他心脏就会紧缩。在一切世人当中他是最可怕的，因为他具有敏锐的理解力，只要是他看到的，他就能看得一清二楚，而他不曾看到的，他便顽固地绝不相信。这一次，老钟表匠却只说了一两句很和气的话。

“欧文，我的孩子，”他说，“明天晚上你一定要上我家去。”

艺术家吞吞吐吐地说了些推托的话。

“哦，你一定要去，”彼得·霍文顿说，“看在你过去曾是我家一员的分上。怎么，孩子！难道你还不知道我女儿安妮已经跟罗伯特·丹福思订婚了吗？我们将以自己简慢的方式招待大家，庆祝这件喜事。”

“啊！”欧文说。

这轻轻的“啊”就是他所说的一切；在彼得·霍文顿听来，这语音显得冷漠和无动于衷。然而它却是可怜的艺术家内心的一声被窒息了的呼喊，他把它强行压抑在心中，就像紧紧按压住一个邪恶的精灵。不过，老钟表匠未曾察觉到的是，年轻人还是让自己小小地发泄了一下。他拿起正准备干活的工具，听任它落在那个细小的机械装置上，这件东西已再度花费了他几个月的思虑与劳作，在这一击之下变得粉碎了！

假如爱情不曾插在其他种种力量当中，偷偷夺走了欧文·沃兰的巧手奇技，那他的故事也就不足以成为努力创造美的人们的忧患人生的写照了。从表面上看，他并不是一个热情满腔、勇于追求的情人；他的激情的骚动起伏都被完全限制在艺术家的想象之中，而安妮本人对此却除了女性的直觉以外一无所知。但在欧文看来，这种爱情却笼罩着他生命的全部领域。上次她未能对他的话做出任何深刻反应，对这件事他已浑然忘却，而是坚持要把自己一切艺术成功的美梦同安妮的形象联系起来；对他来说，她就是体现自己所崇拜的精神力量的化身，他希望自己能在那圣坛上奉献一份不无价值的供品。当然，他是在欺骗自己；安妮·霍文顿并不具有他的想象所赋予她的那些品质。在他内心中呈现出的安妮形象，正如那件神秘的机械装置假如得以完成一样，都只是他自己的创造物。倘若他借助于爱情的成功而认识到自己的错误——倘若他能将安妮拥入怀抱，从而目睹她从天使蜕变为平常妇人——这种失望或许还能逼迫他回头来，集中精力追求自己剩下的唯一目标。也可能是另一种情况，假如他发现安妮真的符合他的想象，那他的命运就美不胜收，只要利用其中多余的材料就能创造出许多美的作品，比他一直辛苦制作的东西更有价值。可是，痛苦披上伪装来到他的身旁，他感到自己生命中的天使遭到强夺，竟被许配给了一个粗俗的铁匠，而那个人既不需要也不能欣赏她的优美品质——命运就是如此乖戾反常，使得人的生存显得那么荒谬和矛盾，简直不必再抱别的希望，也无须再怀有别的忧惧。欧文·沃兰在世上已经一无所有了，只能像个被打晕了的人那样木然呆坐着。

他生了一场大病。病好之后，他那瘦小纤弱的身躯同过去相比平添了许多蠢肉。尖尖的下巴长成了圆形；富于灵性、臻于鬼斧神工的纤细小手，变得比壮实的婴儿的手还要丰满。他的面容呈现出小孩子的稚气，可能会逗引得陌生人想去拍拍他的头——不过伸出的手又会停下来，心里纳闷这个孩子的神态怎么这样奇怪。灵魂仿佛已经脱离了他的心窍，只留下肉体像植物一样蓬勃生长。这并非意味着欧文·沃兰成了一个白痴。他能说会道，而且有条有理。他差不多成了个唠叨鬼，的确，人们都开始这样看待他了；因为他总喜欢不厌其烦地谈论从前读过的书里记载的那些机械奇迹，说他现在总算明白了那全都出于杜撰。他历数艾伯塔斯·马格努斯制造的铜人和培根修士制造的青铜头像，然后讲到近代，提到几匹马拉着小马车的自动机械，据说是给法国皇太子制造的；还说到有一只像苍蝇一样在人耳边嗡嗡叫的昆虫，其实不过是由细小的钢丝弹簧组成的一种装置。他还讲过一个有关鸭子的故事，它能摇摇摆摆地走、嘎嘎地叫和吃东西；不过，要是有哪位诚实的公民买下它去做菜，就会发现自己原来被一只机械制成的假鸭子欺骗了。

“所有这类记载，”欧文·沃兰说，“我现在总算明白了全是骗人的。”

接下来，他又会用神秘的口气承认自己曾经并不这样认为。在那些闲荡和做梦的日子里，他还以为在某种意义上可能把精神赋予机械，使机械与新的生命和运动相结合，从而创造出大自然本想在万物中达到却并未尽力去实现的理想的美。然而，无论是对于实现这个目标的过程还是对这种计划本身，他看来都没有清晰的认识。

“现在我把这一切都扔到一边去啦，”他会这样说，“那不过是年轻人一贯用来迷惑自己的梦幻而已。如今我既然获得了一点儿常识，回头一想就只会让我哈哈大笑了。”

可怜的、可怜而堕落的欧文·沃兰啊！这些迹象表明，他已不再属于围绕着我们的那个看不见的美好世界了。他已经丧失了对无形世界的信念，如今正像这类可悲可叹的人们一贯所做的那样，因世俗的智慧而自鸣得意，甚至摈弃了能目睹的东西，除了能亲手触摸的东西之外一概都不肯相信。这就是这类人的不幸之所在，他们的精神逐渐消亡而只剩下更粗钝的理解力，越来越同化于自己唯一能认知到的东西。不过，欧文·沃兰的精神尚未死灭也未消失，它只是在沉睡而已。

他的精神是怎样再次复苏的，已无案可查。也许麻木的沉睡因一阵抽搐的剧痛而惊醒；也许和过去那一次相同，有蝴蝶飞来在他头顶盘旋飞舞，再次给了他灵感——的确，这阳光之子总是给艺术家传递着神秘的使命——是蝴蝶用他往昔的生活目的来重新激励了他。无论使他全身血管战栗的是痛苦还是欢乐，总之他的第一个冲动就是感谢上天使他再次成为具有思想、想象和最敏锐感觉的人，他已经很久不是这种人了。

“现在动手工作吧，”他说，“我从来没有感到像现在这样充满力量。”

然而，尽管他觉得自己很强壮，但他也因担心死亡会在工作的中途突然袭来而焦虑，这激励着他更加勤奋地苦干。这种对死亡的焦虑，或许在全心全意投身于事业的人当中是十分常见的，在他们心目中那种事业是如此崇高，以致生命被仅仅视为成功的一项重要条件。只要我们热爱生命是为了生命本身，我们就不怎么害怕失去它。当我们渴望生命是为了达到某个目标，这才认识到生命的构造是多么脆弱。不过，与这种不安全感同时存在的，还有一种至关重要的信念，即当我们在从事任何仿佛是上天注定适合于自己的任务时，我们绝不会受到死亡之箭的伤害，这项任务如果我们不完成它，全世界都有理由为之哀痛。难道深受改造人类的信念所鼓舞的哲学家会相信，在他正要说出启发蒙昧之言的一瞬间，死亡会召唤他离弃智慧的生命吗？假如他就这样死去，人类将等待若干困乏的世代慢慢逝去——整个世界生命的流沙将一粒一粒地坠落——然后才会生就另一位哲人来展现当时即可揭示的真理。可是，历史又提供了许多例证来表明，在任何特定的时代，体现最宝贵的精神的个人，按照凡人的标准来判断却往往过早夭折，没有足够的机会来完成自己在人间的使命。哲人易萎，心灵麻木思想怠惰者却长命百岁。诗人之歌中途而废，或者只有在凡人听不见的地方、在天国的合唱中去完成。画家——正如奥斯顿(3)那样——将自己的构思一半留在画布上，以其不完整的美让我们悲伤，却打算用天堂的色彩来描绘出整个画面，假如这么说不算失敬的话。但更有可能的则是今生未完成的构想再没有任何地方可以完成。人的种种最珍贵的计划如此频繁地半途而废，这只能证明尘世的行为无论因虔诚和天才而显得多么超凡入圣，其实是毫无价值的，只不过是作为精神的演练和表现形式而已。在天堂里，一切平常无奇的思想都要比弥尔顿(4)的诗歌更崇高更优美。那么，他是否愿意给他留在人间的未完之作再添上一行呢？

还是回到欧文·沃兰的故事上来吧。他的命运就是要达到自己的生活目标，无论这命运是好是坏。我们略而不谈他经历了很长一段时间的紧张思索、满怀渴望的努力、精密细致的劳作、损心伤神的焦虑，以及随后独享成功欢乐的一瞬：这一切都留给读者去想象吧。后来，在一个冬夜，我们看到艺术家去拜访罗伯特·丹福思，来到了他家的壁炉边。在那里，他看到身躯魁梧的铁匠被家庭生活氛围熏陶得温和而宁静。他也看到了安妮，如今已成为家庭主妇，平添了许多她丈夫那直率刚强的性格，但欧文·沃兰仍然相信她浑身透出一种更精纯的优雅，使她能够充当力与美之间的沟通者。碰巧老彼得·霍文顿当晚也是女儿炉火旁的客人；首先与艺术家的目光相遇的，依然是那种记忆犹新的锋利、冷漠的挑剔神情。

“我的老朋友欧文！”罗伯特·丹福思叫道，他一跃而起，用他那惯于把握铁条的大手紧紧握住艺术家纤细的手指，“到底来看我们啦，这才算好友近邻啊。我还担心是那永恒运动把你迷住了，忘记老交情啦。”

“我们见到你真高兴，”安妮说，一道红晕泛上了她那少妇的面颊，“这么久不来看我们，可不够朋友啊。”

“喂，欧文，”老钟表匠首次致意就是发问，“你那美丽的小玩意儿怎么样啦？你终于造出来了吧？”

艺术家并没有马上回答，因为他被一个在地毯上打滚的壮实小孩吓了一跳——这是一个从无垠空间中神秘地钻出来的小家伙，身板却那样粗壮结实，好像是用地球上最密实的物质压铸而成的。这个前途无量的婴儿朝新来者爬过来，然后像罗伯特·丹福思所说的那样“竖立”起来，用一双如此精明的眼光凝视着欧文，使得那位母亲不由得与丈夫交换了一下自豪的眼神。不过艺术家却被孩子的目光弄得很是局促不安，他觉得这孩子的神态和老彼得·霍文顿的惯常表情非常相似。他甚至想象是老钟表匠被压缩成了这个小孩的形状，透过那双幼童的眼睛在望着他，重复着（老钟表匠这时正好再次发问）那个带有恶意的问题：——

“那个美丽的玩意儿，欧文！那个美丽的玩意儿怎么样啦？你造出来了吗？”

“我造出来啦。”艺术家回答道，眼睛中瞬间闪过一道欢乐的光辉，露出阳光般的微笑，然而又浸透着如此深沉的思绪，简直可以说是近乎哀伤。“是的，朋友们，我说的是实话。我造出来了。”

“当真！”安妮喊道，脸上又隐隐透出少女般的欢乐，“现在总可以问一问这秘密是什么了吧？”

“当然，我来就是为了揭开秘密的，”欧文·沃兰回答说，“你会知道、看到、摸到并拥有这个秘密！因为，安妮——如果我还能这样称呼我童年时代的伙伴——安妮，正是为了要送你一件新婚礼物，我才制作出这个精神化的机械，这个具有和谐的运动和美的神秘的东西。它的确来得晚了些；不过正因为随着我们年龄的增长，事物都开始失去了鲜艳的色彩，我们的灵魂也丧失了微妙的感受力，所以才特别需要美的精神。只要——原谅我，安妮——只要你懂得该怎样估价这件礼物，它就绝不算来得太晚。”

他一边说，一边掏出一个像是珠宝盒的匣子。那是他亲手用乌檀木精雕而成的，上面镶嵌着窗格形的奇异珍珠花饰，描绘一个小男孩在追逐着一只蝴蝶，在另一处，那只蝴蝶化作了一个长翅膀的精灵，正在向天堂飞去；那个男孩或者少年为了赢得这只美丽的蝴蝶，从强烈的渴求中获得了超凡的能耐，竟从地面飞升到云端，又从云端直抵浩渺的天宇。艺术家打开了这个乌木匣，叫安妮把手指放在匣边。她照办了，但几乎惊叫起来，因为这时有一只蝴蝶突然闪翅飞出来，落在了她的指尖上，扑闪着华丽夺目的带有金色斑点的紫色翅膀，仿佛准备着要腾空飞翔。那种辉煌、那种华美、那种精致豪华尽被柔化融合入这件物体的纯美之中，简直无法用言语来形容。大自然理想的蝴蝶在这里获得了完美的实现；它并非仿照那种在大地花丛中飞翔的色彩暗淡的小昆虫，而是盘旋在天堂的草地上，让小天使和早逝婴儿的灵魂追逐嬉戏的神奇之物。可以看到它的翅膀上有一层茂密的绒毛，它那眼睛的光泽似乎充满了灵气。炉火的亮光在这神奇之物四周微微闪烁——烛光在它身上闪耀着虹彩；但它分明是借助于自己的光辉而发亮，照彻了它所留驻的手指和那只伸出的手，就像镶嵌在那里的一块散发着乳白光芒的宝石。它的美无与伦比，使人完全不去考虑它形体的微小。但即使它的翅膀大得横跨天穹，人的心灵所获得的充实和满足也莫过于此。

“真美呀！真美呀！”安妮叫道，“它是活的吗？它是活的吗？”

“活的？当然是活的啰，”她的丈夫回答说，“你以为哪个凡人有本事造出一只蝴蝶？或者既然任何一个孩子都能在夏天的午后逮到十几只，谁还会自找麻烦去造一只出来？活的？当然是活的！不过，这个漂亮匣子却无疑是我们的朋友欧文造出来的；它倒的确能给他争光。”

就在这时，那只蝴蝶又再次扇动翅膀，动作是那么栩栩如生，竟让安妮吓了一跳，甚至感到了畏惧；因为尽管丈夫有那种看法，她自己却无法肯定它到底是活的呢，或者只是一件奇妙的机械。

“是活的吗？”她重复道，比原先更加认真。

“你自己来判断吧。”欧文·沃兰说，他站在那儿，神情专注地凝视着她的脸。

这时候蝴蝶蓦然飞到了空中，围绕着安妮的头顶盘旋，然后又飞翔到客厅远处的角落，但依然可以感觉到它翅膀扇动所化成的一圈闪烁的光辉。躺在地板上的小孩子用他那双精明的小眼睛追寻着它的飞翔路线。蝴蝶在屋里飞了一圈之后，绕了道盘旋的曲线，重新落到了安妮的手指上。

“可它到底是不是活的呀？”她又一次惊呼道；她的那根手指战抖得那么厉害，停留在上面的那个灿烂夺目的神秘之物不得不展开翅膀来保持平衡。“告诉我，它到底是活的呢，还是你造出来的？”

“为什么要问是谁造的，既然它这么美？”欧文·沃兰回答道，“是不是活的？是的，安妮；你满可以说它具有生命，因为它已经把我的生命吸收入体内了；在这只蝴蝶的奥秘中，在它的美中——它的美不仅在于外形，更深及整个机体——体现了一个追求美的艺术家的智慧、想象、感觉、灵魂！是呀；我创造了它，但是”——说到这儿他的脸色稍微有点改变——“现在这只蝴蝶对我来说，已经不是青春时代白日梦中所遥望的那个东西了。”

“不管它是什么，总归是件漂亮玩意儿，”铁匠说，一边带着孩童似的欢乐咧开嘴笑，“不知道它肯不肯屈尊停落在我这根又大又笨的指头上？把它移到这里来，安妮。”

在艺术家的指点下，安妮把她的指尖挨到丈夫的指尖上；稍微等待了片刻，蝴蝶就从这根手指飞到了那根手指上。它在开始第二次飞翔之前也先扑腾了一阵翅膀，与第一次相似却又不尽相同。接着，它便从铁匠那结实的手指上飞起，绕着逐渐加大的圈子盘旋着，一直飞到天花板，围着屋子飞了一大圈之后，又以波浪般起伏的动作返回原地。

“嗨，简直是巧夺天工！”罗伯特·丹福思喊道，他用自己所能想得出的话来表达衷心的赞美；的确，即使他只说得出这么一句，任何言辞更优雅、感受更细腻的人也很难再找出什么话来补充了。

“这个我可办不到，我得承认。不过，那又有什么关系？我的大铁锤这么一敲，比起我们的朋友欧文浪费了整整五年工夫造出的这只蝴蝶来，更有实际用处。”

这时候，那个小孩子拍着手，含糊不清地咿咿呀呀大叫起来，看样子是想要这只蝴蝶来做玩具。

与此同时，欧文·沃兰瞟了一眼安妮，想知道她是否赞同她丈夫关于美与实用之间价值高低的评价。在她对他的亲切态度中，在她审视他亲手创造的神奇作品和他理念的化身时所表现出的惊异与赞美中，含有某种隐秘的蔑视——太隐秘了，或许她自己也没有意识到，只有艺术家的这种本能的辨析力才能感知。不过欧文在自己理想追求的后期业已超脱出来了，否则这样的发现是会使他备受折磨的。他明白，世人和作为世人代表的安妮无论给予他什么赞美，都无法以贴切的话语和恰当的感情来对一位艺术家做完全的报偿，而这位艺术家却以微末之物来体现一种崇高精神——将凡俗之物转化为精神的珍宝——终于将美捕捉到自己的作品之中。他并不是到了这最后一刻才明白，一切高尚行为的报偿只能在行为本身里去寻找，向别处寻找只能是徒劳。不过，安妮和她的丈夫，甚至彼得·霍文顿，可能对这件事的重要性也有充分的理解，他们也满意地看到他多年的心血总算得到了与之相称的回报。欧文·沃兰本可以告诉他们，这只蝴蝶，这个小玩意儿，这件可怜的钟表匠送给铁匠妻子的新婚礼物，实际上是一件艺术珍宝，帝王君主都愿意用荣誉和巨额财富来交换，并作为自己王国最稀罕最奇妙的宝物来钟爱。然而艺术家只是笑了笑，把这个秘密藏在了心里。

“爸爸，”安妮说，心想老钟表匠说点赞许的话也许能使当年的徒弟开心，“过来欣赏一下这只漂亮的蝴蝶呀。”

“让我们看一看吧。”彼得·霍文顿说，他从椅子上爬起来，脸上带着讥嘲的笑容，这副神气常常令人像他本人一样怀疑除了物质之外的任何事物。“我的手指头在这儿，让它落上来吧。我一旦摸到它心里就更清楚了。”

可是，让安妮越来越惊诧的是，当她父亲的指尖刚挨到蝴蝶所停留的她丈夫的手指时，小昆虫就垂下了翅膀，仿佛立即就要跌落到地板上。甚至连它翅膀上和身子上的那些灿烂的金色斑点——除非她的眼睛在欺骗她——也变得暗淡了，明亮的紫色蒙上了一层灰翳，同时在铁匠手掌周围闪亮的点点光彩也越来越微弱，最后消失了。

“它快死了！快死了！”安妮惊惶地大叫道。

“它的制作非常微妙，”艺术家平静地说，“正像我告诉你的，它吸收了一种精神要素——可以叫它生物磁力，或者随便什么。在怀疑和讥嘲的气氛中，它的精微感觉会受到折磨，正像将自身生命倾注在它里面的那个人灵魂也会受到折磨一样。它已经丧失了它的美；再过片刻，它的机械性能将要受到无法弥补的损坏。”

“把您的手拿开，爸爸！”安妮恳求道，脸色变得苍白，“我的孩子在这儿，让蝴蝶停在他纯洁的手上吧。在那儿，也许它的生命会复活，色彩也会变得更加鲜明。”

她的父亲带着辛辣的笑容，缩回了他的手指。接着，蝴蝶似乎恢复了自由运动的能力，色彩也呈现出原有的光泽，那星光般闪烁的光芒是它最奇妙的特征，现在也重新聚为一圈围绕着它的光环。一开始，当它从罗伯特·丹福思的手上转移到孩子的小手指上时，这道光芒变得非常明亮，竟清晰地把孩子的身影投射到了墙上。同时，那个孩子也照着爸爸妈妈的动作，伸出胖乎乎的小手，带着童稚气的喜悦看着蝴蝶扇动翅膀。可是，孩子脸上透出某种古怪的精明神气，使欧文·沃兰觉得面前就是老彼得·霍文顿，只不过是把他那顽固不化的怀疑主义部分地变换成了孩童气的信任而已。

“这小淘气看上去多聪明啊！”丹福思悄声对妻子说。

“我从来没有见过小孩子能有这种神态。”安妮回答道，她赞赏自己的孩子是有充足理由的，远远胜过对艺术家的蝴蝶的赞赏。“小宝贝比我们更懂得这东西的奥秘。”

似乎蝴蝶也和艺术家一样，意识到这孩子的天性中存在着某种与它不完全投合的东西，便时而闪烁亮光，时而又变得暗淡。最后，它从孩子的小手上飞起，以轻盈的动作毫不费力地向上飞翔，仿佛主人的精神所赋予它的超凡本能在驱使着这个美好幻影不由自主地向一个更高领域飞升。要是这里没有障碍的话，它很可能已经飞进天宇，化为不朽之物了。然而它的光辉只能闪耀在天花板上；翅膀的精微构造擦刮到那种粗陋的物体，几点光亮像星尘一般飘坠下来，落到地毯上微微闪烁着。随即蝴蝶便飞落下来，但并没有返回那个小孩子的手指，而是被艺术家的手吸引过去了。

“别这样！别这样！”欧文·沃兰喃喃地说，仿佛自己的作品能听懂他的话，“你已经从主人的心中诞生出来，再也不能回去了。”

蝴蝶略为犹豫了一阵，发出了一道战抖的光芒，接着便挣扎着飞向那个孩子，似乎想要落到他的手指上；可是就在它仍然在空中盘旋的时候，那个浑身力气、脸上带着外祖父的精明神气的孩子猛然伸手抓住这个奇妙的虫子，紧紧地把它握在手中。安妮尖叫起来。老彼得·霍文顿则爆发出一阵冷酷的、嘲讽的大笑。铁匠用尽力气掰开孩子的手，发现掌心里只剩下一堆闪闪发光的碎片，美的奥秘已经在那里永远消失了。至于欧文·沃兰，却心平气和地看着自己的毕生心血付之毁灭，然而这绝不是毁灭。他已经捕捉到了远比这只蝴蝶更重要的东西。当艺术家的人格升华到至美的境界，他为了使世人感知到美而借助的那个象征物，在他眼中便没有多少价值了，而他的精神则在现实的欢乐中臻于圆满自足。

雪人


一个寒冷冬日的下午，当太阳在漫长的暴风雪过后发出寒光的时候，两个孩子央求妈妈准许他们跑出家门，到地里新降的雪中去玩耍。大孩子是个小姑娘，因为她性情温柔谦和，大家又都觉得她长得挺美，所以父母亲和熟悉她的人总是叫她“紫罗兰”。不过大家都知道她弟弟的名字叫作“牡丹”，因为他圆嘟嘟的小脸老是红通通的，让每个人都想到阳光和一朵朵大红花。两个孩子的父亲叫林赛先生，我们必须着重说明，他是一位很优秀的却又特别务实的人，经营五金生意，考虑一切事情都毫不动摇地惯于采取所谓“常识”的观点。他的心肠差不多跟别人的一样软，但脑筋却跟他卖的铁茶壶一样坚硬和难以穿透，因此大概也是同样的空空如也。至于那位母亲，性格中却含有一种诗意的气质，一种超越凡俗的美——就好像一朵娇柔带露的鲜花，安然无损地度过了富于想象力的青春时代，在充当主妇与母亲的枯燥无聊的现实生活中依然保持着勃勃生机。

就这样，正像我开头所说的，紫罗兰与牡丹央求妈妈让他们跑出去，到新降的雪中去玩耍。因为尽管原先雪花看上去那么阴沉乏味，一直从灰蒙蒙的天空飘飘坠落着，但现在阳光正照射在雪地上，呈现出一派非常欢乐的景象。孩子们住在城里，没有更宽敞的游玩地，只是家门前有一个小小的花园，一道白色的篱笆把它与街道隔开，一棵梨树和两三棵李子树向园中投下浓荫，客厅窗下还长着一丛玫瑰。不过，果树和玫瑰这时节都落光了叶子，细枝上裹着一层薄雪，仿佛是冬季的叶簇，这儿那儿还挂着冰柱，权且充作果实。

“好吧，紫罗兰——好吧，我的小牡丹，”他们那和蔼的母亲说，“你们可以出去到雪地里玩。”

于是，这位好太太用羊毛外套和厚袜子把两个小宝贝裹起来，在他们的脖子上围上羊毛围巾，再给他们各自的小腿套上一双带绑腿的高筒靴，给他们的小手戴上毛线手套，然后给他们各自一个亲吻当作驱走严寒的咒语。两个孩子冲出门去，蹦蹦跳跳地立刻扎进了一大堆雪的中央，然后紫罗兰像只雪鹀那样钻出了雪堆，小牡丹则手脚扑腾着爬出来，露出鲜花盛开般的圆脸蛋。他们玩得多么快活啊！看着他们在冬日的花园中嬉戏，你会觉得阴郁无情的暴风雪所以会到来并不为别的，只是为了给紫罗兰和牡丹提供一种新游戏；两个孩子所以会被创造出来，也与雪鹀一样是为了要在暴风雪中、在大地的银装素裹中求取欢乐。

最后，当他们彼此用一把把白雪撒满全身时，紫罗兰开心地对着小牡丹大笑了一阵，然后猛然冒出了一个新主意。

“你看起来活像一个雪人，牡丹，”她说，“要是你的脸蛋儿不这么红的话。这让我想出了一个好主意！让我们堆个雪人吧——堆个小姑娘——她可以做我们的妹妹，整个冬天都跟着我们到处跑、一起玩。这不是个好主意吗？”

“啊，好！”牡丹叫道，他尽量想把意思表达清楚，因为他还只是个小男孩。“这个主意真好！妈妈也会看见它的！”

“是呀，”紫罗兰回答说，“妈妈也会看见这个新来的小姑娘。不过她不能让小姑娘进温暖的客厅里去；因为，你知道，我们的小雪妹妹是不喜欢温暖的。”

于是孩子们立即着手执行这项重大任务，要堆出一个会到处跑的雪人；这时候妈妈正坐在窗前，听到了他们的谈话，忍不住对他们开始行动时那一本正经的模样发笑。他们似乎真以为用雪堆出一个活生生的小姑娘一点儿也不困难。说句真话，假如能够创造出奇迹的话，其实正应该像紫罗兰和牡丹这样头脑纯朴、心无疑虑，马上开始动手干，甚至于不知道它是否是一桩奇迹。母亲就是这么想的；她还想到刚从天上降下来的新雪倒是创造新生命的绝好材料，假如不是那么冰冷就好了。她再看了一会儿孩子们，高兴地望着他们小小的身影——女儿，个头儿长得超过了年龄，体态优雅而灵活，肤色娇嫩，看上去就像一种欢乐的意念，而不像血肉之躯——牡丹的个子却往宽处长不往高处长，迈着又短又结实的双腿滚来滚去，像一头大象般壮实，虽说并没有那么庞大。接着妈妈又继续干她的活儿。我记不起她干的是什么活儿了；总之不是在为紫罗兰修整绸帽，就是在织补小牡丹的短腿穿的一双长袜吧。不过她忍不住一而再、再而三地把头转向窗口，去看孩子们的雪人堆得怎么样了。

的确，这真是极其令人愉悦的景象，两个生气勃勃的小家伙在忙着干自己的工作！看着他们干得那么内行那么熟练，又是多么的美妙。紫罗兰担任指挥，吩咐弟弟该干什么，而她则用自己纤细的小手塑造雪人更细致的部位。事实上，雪人似乎不是两个孩子堆出来的，倒像是在他们手下逐渐长大的，而他们一直在同雪人玩耍和天真地交谈着。他们的母亲看到这一切非常惊奇；她看得越久，就越是惊奇。

“我的孩子多出色呀！”她心想，怀着母亲的骄傲微笑着，同时也在笑自己怎么会为孩子感到如此骄傲。“别的孩子第一次尝试就能用雪堆出这么活灵活现的小姑娘吗？唔——可我现在必须缝好牡丹的新外衣，因为他爷爷明天要来，我想让小家伙看上去漂亮些。”

于是她拿起那件外衣，很快就像两个孩子忙着堆雪人那样又忙碌地缝起来。不过当母亲在衣服上飞针走线的时候，仍然倾听着紫罗兰和牡丹快活的声音，从而使她的劳作变得轻巧而愉快。两个孩子一直在相互交谈着，舌头和手脚一样地动个不停。时不时地，她会听不清他们谈些什么，只是喜滋滋地感到他们彼此亲亲爱爱，正玩得非常开心，堆雪人的活儿也进行得很顺利。不过有时候紫罗兰和牡丹碰巧会提高声音，他们说的话便能字字听清，就像在母亲眼下置身的客厅里说话一样。啊，这些话在她心里多么愉快地回响着啊，即使他们自己根本无意说得这么聪明和精彩！

不过你应该明白，一位母亲在倾听时用心远胜于用耳朵，这样她就常常会因仙乐的颤音而感到欢悦，别的人对此却一无所闻。

“牡丹！牡丹！”紫罗兰高声喊着弟弟，他跑到花园的另一边去了。“给我运一些新雪来，牡丹，从最远的那个角落，我们还没踩过的地方。我要用它来做小雪妹妹的胸膛。你知道那部分必须非常洁白，就同刚从天上落下的雪一样。”

“给你，紫罗兰！”牡丹回答道，他的语气很粗率——但那语气也非常可爱——一面从踏得半紧的雪堆中踉踉跄跄地走过来。“给你做胸膛的白雪。啊，紫罗兰，她的模样开始变得多么——美——丽呀！”

“是呀，”紫罗兰若有所思地轻声说，“我们的雪妹妹的确很可爱。我真没有想到，牡丹，我们能堆出一个这么漂亮的小姑娘。”

妈妈一边听一边想，假如仙女们——或者更好些——小天使们能从天堂下凡，隐着身形同她的宝贝们一起玩耍，帮助他们堆雪人，并赋予它仙童般的相貌，那该是多么美妙的事情啊！紫罗兰和牡丹是不会觉察到这些神仙玩伴的，他们只会在干活儿的时候看到雪人变得非常美丽，还以为全是自己的功劳呢。

“我的小姑娘和小男孩配有这种玩伴，只要人间的孩子曾经有过这种经历！”母亲自语道，接着又为自己母性的骄傲而自嘲地笑起来。

然而，这个念头却牢牢抓住了她的想象；她不时地朝窗外瞥上一眼，半梦半真地觉得自己会看到来自天堂的金发仙童正在同金发的紫罗兰和红脸蛋的牡丹玩耍着。

现在，有一阵子，又传来两个孩子匆促而热切的却又不太分明的说话声，这是紫罗兰和牡丹正高兴地协力干活儿。紫罗兰好像仍然在当指挥，牡丹则更像是出劳力的，从远处近处给她运雪过来。不过这小淘气显然很通晓自己的行当！

“牡丹，牡丹！”紫罗兰喊道，因为弟弟又跑到花园另一边去了。“把绕在梨树矮枝上的小雪圈弄些过来。你可以爬到雪堆上去，牡丹，这样就容易摸到了。给雪妹妹做鬈发非得要用它！”

“给你，紫罗兰！”小男孩回答，“当心别弄碎了。干得好！干得好！多漂亮啊！”

“她是不是很可爱啊？”紫罗兰的声音里含着满足，“现在我们还得弄些闪亮的小冰块来，给她做亮晶晶的眼睛。她还没完工哪。妈妈会觉得她非常美丽；不过爸爸会说：‘啐！瞎胡闹！——快从冰冷的外面进屋来！’”

“我们叫妈妈朝窗外看，”牡丹说，接着就大声喊，“妈妈！妈妈！！妈妈！！！朝外看，看我们做了一个多可爱的小雪妹妹呀！”

母亲暂时放下手中的活儿，朝窗外望去。可是碰巧这时太阳已经降落得接近地球边缘——因为今天属于一年中白昼最短的季节——余晖正斜照着这位太太的双眼。所以你要明白，她被晃得眼花缭乱，不太能看清花园里的东西。不过，透过夕阳与新雪那明亮炫目的光线，她还是看到园中有一个小小的白色身影，似乎跟真人一模一样。她也看到了紫罗兰和牡丹——实际上她看他们的时间比看雪人更长——她看到两个孩子还在忙着干活儿；牡丹在运送新雪，紫罗兰则把雪堆到雪人身上，谨严得就像一个雕塑家在给他的塑像雏形添加黏土。她虽然不太能看清雪娃娃的模样，却暗自思忖过去从没见过谁能把雪人做得这么精巧，更没见过有这么可爱的小姑娘和小男孩能做得出来。

“他们干什么事都比别的孩子强，”妈妈说，心里很是得意，“难怪雪人也堆得更好！”

她又坐下来干她的活儿，而且尽量干得更快些；因为天色很快就要暗下来了，而牡丹的外衣还没有完工，预计爷爷明天一大早就会乘火车到达。于是她飞针走线，缝得越来越快。孩子们也一直在花园里忙碌着，不过母亲仍然在倾听，尽量捕捉到他们的只言片语。她颇有兴味地注意到两个孩子把自己幼稚的想象同正在干的事儿融合在一起，不由自主地完全沉浸在想象之中。他们似乎认定雪孩子真的会跟着他们跑来跑去，一道玩耍哩。

“她会是我们多好的玩伴啊，整整一个冬天！”紫罗兰说，“我希望爸爸不会害怕她让我们患感冒！你能不喜欢她吗，牡丹？”

“啊，喜欢！”牡丹叫道，“我还要抱住她，她会紧挨着我坐，喝我的热牛奶！”

“啊，不行，牡丹！”紫罗兰回答，一本正经地显示自己有见识，“那根本不行。热牛奶不适宜我们的小雪妹妹的身体健康。像她这样的小雪人除了冰棍儿什么也不吃。不，不，牡丹；我们不能给她喝任何热东西！”

有那么一两分钟静默无声，因为小腿儿不知疲倦的牡丹又跑到花园的另一边去了。突然，紫罗兰快乐地大叫起来：“快看这儿，牡丹！快来呀！从那片玫瑰红的云彩里射出了一道光，正照在她的脸蛋儿上！玫瑰红色一直不消失！不是很美丽吗？”

“是呀，真——美——丽，”牡丹回答道，特意留神把三个音节念准确，“啊，紫罗兰，看看她的头发！像金子一样！”

“啊，当然，”紫罗兰平静地说，好像这完全是毋庸置疑的事，“这种颜色，你知道，是从我们看见的天上那些金色云彩里得来的。她现在差不多完工了。不过她的嘴唇应当很红——比她的脸蛋儿更红。牡丹，要是我们都亲亲她的嘴唇，说不定就能使它变红！”

于是，母亲听见了两下轻快的亲吻声，好像两个孩子都在雪孩子那冰凉的嘴上亲了亲。不过，似乎这样并没有使雪孩子的嘴唇足够红润，紫罗兰又建议让雪孩子去亲吻牡丹的红脸蛋儿。

“来吧，小雪妹妹，亲亲我！”牡丹喊道。

“好啦！她亲过你了，”紫罗兰接着说，“现在她的嘴唇很红了。她还窘得有点脸红了哩！”

“啊，多凉的吻啊！”牡丹叫了起来。

这在这时候，西边吹来一股洁净无尘的微风，扫过花园，刮得客厅的窗户咯咯作响。风声令人顿感料峭的冬寒，母亲正要用她戴着顶针的手指去敲窗玻璃，唤两个孩子进屋来，他们却突然齐声对她发出喊叫。那并不是惊诧的声音，不过能明显地听出他们非常激动；像是因为眼前发生的什么事而欢欣鼓舞，而那件事他们一直在盼望着并且料想到会发生。

“妈妈！妈妈！我们的小雪妹妹做成了，她正在跟我们一道在花园里跑呢！”

“多么富于想象力的小家伙啊！”母亲心想，一面给牡丹的外衣缝上最后几针，“说来也怪，他们让我几乎也变成他们那样的小孩子了！现在，我也禁不住相信那个小雪人真的变活啦！”

“亲爱的妈妈！”紫罗兰喊道，“请往外面看，看看我们有个多么可爱的玩伴啊！”

母亲被孩子们这么一央求，再也不能耽搁，赶紧从窗户往外看。太阳这时已从天际消失，但把光明的丰厚遗产留给了那些紫色和金色的云霞，使得冬日的黄昏显得如此壮观。不过，窗户上和雪地上没有一丝刺眼和炫目的亮光，所以那位慈爱的太太能够将花园遍览无遗，看清园中的每一件东西和每一个人。你猜她在花园里看见了什么？当然，看见了紫罗兰和牡丹，她的两个宝贝孩子。啊，可是除了他们，她还看见了什么东西或者什么人呢？嗨，如果你肯相信的话，花园里还有一个小姑娘的身影，她穿着一身雪白的衣裳，脸颊泛着玫瑰色的红晕，鬈发辉耀着金黄的光泽，正同两个孩子在那儿玩哩！尽管她是个陌生人，却显得跟紫罗兰和牡丹挺亲密，他们对她也是这样，仿佛三个人自出生以来就一直在一起玩似的。母亲心中暗想，这一定是某位邻居家的小女儿，看到紫罗兰和牡丹在花园里，就穿过大街跑来同他们一起玩耍。于是，这位慈爱的太太就走到门口，想邀请这个偷跑出来的小姑娘进自己舒适的客厅里来；因为阳光已经消逝，户外的空气正变得越来越寒冷了。

可是，她打开房门后，却在门槛前站立了片刻，犹豫着是不是该请这孩子进来，或者是不是该跟她讲话。的确，她几乎怀疑这究竟是不是个真孩子，或者只是新降下的雪所映照出的一个光圈，被猛烈的寒风刮得在花园里到处转。这个陌生小孩的模样颇有些不寻常。在所有邻居的孩子中，太太想不起谁有这样一张脸孔，有这么洁白的皮肤，有这样精致的玫瑰红的脸蛋儿，额前和脸颊边还有金色的鬈发在飘扬。至于她的衣裳，一身都是雪白的，在风中招展着，在严寒的冬季，有理智的女人是绝不会让孩子穿着这样的衣裳到户外去玩耍的。只要看一看那双小脚，慈爱而细心的母亲就不禁打了个寒战；脚上什么也没有穿，只有一双极薄的白色小拖鞋。然而，她尽管穿得极其单薄，却似乎丝毫也不感觉寒冷，竟那么轻盈地在雪地里翩翩起舞，脚尖在地面上几乎没留下一个脚印。紫罗兰只能勉强赶上她的脚步，牡丹的腿太短，不得不落在后头。

在他们游戏的过程中，新来的孩子有一次跑到紫罗兰和牡丹中间，分别牵起他们的一只手，快活地朝前跳，他们也跟着她跳。可是，牡丹几乎立刻就抽出了他的小手，开始用力地搓，好像手指头被冻疼了似的。紫罗兰也松开了她的手，不过动作没有那么突然，同时一本正经地说还是别拉手好些。穿白袍子的小姑娘什么也没说，只是继续跳舞，和原先一样的快活。就算紫罗兰和牡丹不愿意跟她一起玩，她也能让轻快而寒冷的西风做她的好玩伴，让风儿把她刮得在花园里转悠，任风儿对她那么随意放肆，似乎他们已是多年相熟的老朋友了。母亲一直站在门口看着，心里纳闷小姑娘怎么会那样像飞舞的雪花，或者说雪花怎么会那样像小姑娘。

她把紫罗兰叫过来，悄声地说：

“紫罗兰，我的宝贝，这个孩子叫什么名字？”她问道，“她就住在我们附近吧？”

“嗨，亲爱的妈妈，”女儿大笑着回答，心想妈妈连这么明白的事情都不懂，“这就是我们刚才一直在做的小雪妹妹呀！”

“是呀，亲爱的妈妈，”牡丹高声说，一面朝妈妈跟前跑去，抬起头率真地望着她的脸，“这就是我们的小雪人！她不是一个可爱的小孩子吗？”

就在这时候，有一群雪鹀从空中飞掠而至。很自然，它们躲开了紫罗兰和牡丹，但是——这看来很奇怪——它们立刻就向白衣小姑娘飞去，在她头上急匆匆拍翅飞翔着，然后停落到她肩头上，仿佛确认她是一个老朋友似的。而小雪人呢，见到这些小鸟儿——冬爷爷的小孙子——显然很高兴，就像它们见到她很高兴一样，并且伸出她的双手来欢迎它们。于是小鸟们全都急着要落到她的两只手掌上和十根小手指上，你挤我我挤你，小翅膀使劲地扑腾着。一只可爱的小鸟温柔地蜷在她的胸怀中，另一只则伸出嘴去亲她的嘴唇。它们始终是那么快活，那么惬意，正像你也许见过的它们同暴风雪嬉戏时的情景。

紫罗兰和牡丹站在那里，看着这美妙的情景开怀大笑；他们分享着新伙伴与这些长着小翅膀的客人共度的欢乐时光，就像自己也参与其中一样。

“紫罗兰，”母亲颇感困惑地说，“跟我讲实话，别开玩笑，这个小姑娘是谁？”

“我亲爱的妈妈，”紫罗兰回答道，她严肃地望着母亲的脸，显然对她竟需要进一步的解释感到吃惊，“我已经告诉过你她是谁了。她是我们的小雪人，是牡丹同我一起造出来的。牡丹也会像我这样告诉你。”

“是的，妈妈，”牡丹断然肯定说，红红的小脸显得非常严肃，“这就是雪孩子。她不是很可爱吗？不过，妈妈，她的手多冷啊！”

正当妈妈犹豫着不知该怎么想和怎么做的时候，临街的大门忽然被推开了，紫罗兰和牡丹的父亲走了进来。他穿着宽大的厚绒呢短外衣，毛皮帽低低拉下来罩在耳朵上，戴着一双极厚的手套。林赛先生是个中年人，那张被风吹红、被霜刺疼的脸上显露出疲乏却又快乐的神情，仿佛他已经忙碌了一整天，现在很高兴能回到安宁的家中。他看到妻子和孩子们，不由得双眼一亮，虽然发现全家人在这么阴冷的天气，而且在日落之后都站在露天里，忍不住说了一两句表示惊奇的话。他很快就发觉了那个穿白衣的陌生小姑娘，正在花园里跑来跑去，就像一只旋舞的雪花圈，还有一群雪鹀在她头上飞翔着。

“嗨，那个小姑娘是谁呀？”这位深明事理的男人问道，“她母亲一定是疯了，竟让她在今天这样冷得刺骨的天气里跑出来，只穿着那件轻飘飘的白袍子，那么一双薄薄的拖鞋！”

“亲爱的丈夫，”他妻子说，“关于这个小家伙我知道的并不比你多。我猜想，大概是哪家邻居的孩子吧。可我们的紫罗兰和牡丹，”她接着又补充道，暗自笑话自己居然会重复一个如此荒唐的故事，“却硬说她只不过是个小雪人，他俩差不多整个下午都在花园里忙着干这件事。”

母亲一边说着，一边把目光投向孩子们原来堆雪人的地方。当她看到孩子们费了那么多工夫堆成的雪人竟然无踪无影，是何等惊异啊！——根本没有雪人——甚至也没有雪堆！——什么也没有，除了一块空地周围留下的一圈小脚印！

“这真是太奇怪了！”她说。

“有什么奇怪的，亲爱的妈妈？”紫罗兰问，“亲爱的爸爸，难道你还不明白吗？这就是我们的小雪人，是牡丹和我造出来的，因为我们想再有个玩伴。是不是，牡丹？”

“是呀，爸爸，”红脸蛋儿的牡丹说，“这是我们的小雪妹妹，她不是很——美——丽吗？可是她给了我一个那么冷的吻！”

“啐！胡说八道，孩子们！”他们那正直而诚实的父亲大喝道，我们已经提到过，他看待事物特别符合常情常理。“别告诉我什么用雪造出活人来的胡话。好啦，太太；这个陌生的小姑娘片刻也不能在阴冷的户外待下去了。我们要把她带进客厅里去；你用热面包和热牛奶给她做一餐晚饭，尽量让她舒适些。同时，我到几个邻居家去问一问；如果有必要，叫城里传呼消息的人沿街喊一喊，通知大家这儿有个走丢了的孩子。”

这位为人诚实而且心地非常仁慈的男子一边这么说着，一边朝白衣小姑娘走去，心中怀着世上最良好的意愿。可是紫罗兰和牡丹每人拉住父亲的一只手，急切地恳求他别带她进屋。

“亲爱的爸爸，”紫罗兰喊道，把身子朝他跟前一挡，“我给你说的是实话！这是我们的小雪妹妹，她不呼吸寒风就一刻也活不下去。别带她进暖和的屋子！”

“是的，爸爸，”牡丹高声叫道，热切地用力跺着他的小脚，“这就是我们的小雪娃娃！她不喜欢热烘烘的炉火！”

“胡说八道，孩子们，胡说八道，胡说八道！”父亲喝道，他认为他们这是愚蠢的固执，半觉恼怒，半觉好笑。“跑步进屋去，马上跑！现在天太晚了，不能再玩了。我必须赶紧照料这个小姑娘，不然她会冻死的！”

“亲爱的丈夫！”妻子悄声地说——她一直在仔细观看那个雪孩子，现在感到比原先更迷惑了——“这件事里有些地方真的很奇特。你会觉得我在犯傻——不过——不过——说不定我们的孩子做雪人的那种单纯与真诚，吸引了某个隐身的天使吧？说不定她在那永恒生命中花上一个钟头，来和两个可爱的小家伙玩耍了一会儿吧？其结果就产生了人们所说的奇迹。不，不！别笑我；我知道这是个愚蠢的想法！”

“我亲爱的太太，”丈夫开心大笑着回答，“你简直跟紫罗兰和牡丹一样是个孩子。”

在某种意义上看，她的确是如此，因为她终其一生都让自己的心充满了孩子般的单纯与真诚，她的心就像水晶一样纯洁清澈；而且她透过这明澈的心去看待一切事物，常常能看到极为深刻的真理，其他人却将其视为愚蠢与荒唐而加以嘲笑。

然而此刻，好心的林赛先生已经挣脱了两个孩子，走进了花园；两个孩子仍然在他身后尖叫着，央求他让雪孩子自由自在地留在寒冷的西风中。当他一走近，那群雪鹀就全飞走了。白衣小姑娘也往后逃，一边摇着头，仿佛在说：“请别碰我！”看上去她好像还淘气地把他引向雪堆的最深处。有一次，那位好心人脚下一绊，踉跄着摔了个嘴啃泥，爬起来的时候粗呢外衣上沾满了雪，白花花的活像个最大号的雪人。与此同时，有些邻居从自家窗户里望见他，都纳闷可怜的林赛先生中了哪门子邪，竟在自己的花园里跑来跑去，追赶被西风刮得四处窜的一团雪！终于，经过了千辛万苦，他把陌生的小姑娘赶进了一个角落，这下她再也没法从他手中逃走了。妻子一直在旁边看着，这时已接近天黑时分，她突然惊奇地发现雪孩子身上晶莹闪烁，好像浑身上下都在发光；被赶进那个角落里时，她简直就像一颗星星那样闪耀着光辉！那是一种冷若冰霜的光辉，犹如冰柱在月光下发出的寒光。妻子心想，奇怪的是林赛先生竟看不出雪孩子有任何异常的地方。

“过来，你这古怪的小家伙！”诚实的人喊叫道，一把抓住雪孩子的手，“我终于逮住你啦，我要让你舒舒服服的，不管你愿意不愿意。我们要给你冻伤的小脚穿上一双暖和的毛线袜，再用又软又厚的披巾把你包起来。我担心你那可怜的小白鼻子已经冻坏啦，不过我们会把一切弄妥帖的。快跟我进屋去。”

就这样，这位意愿极其良好的先生尽管满脸冻成了青紫色，却仍然带着最慈爱的笑容，拉住雪孩子的手朝家门走去。雪孩子跟着他，垂头丧气，满心的不乐意；她身上所有的光辉和闪光都消失了。刚才她还像霜冻时节缀满群星的明亮黄昏，在寒冷的地平线上焕发出绯红的余晖，现在却像融化了的冰雪一样阴郁暗淡，没精打采。在慈爱的林赛先生带她走上门前的台阶时，紫罗兰和牡丹窥视着他的脸——他们眼中充满了泪水，没等流下脸蛋儿就冻成了冰——姐弟俩再次恳求他别带小雪人进屋。

“不带她进去！”那位好心肠的人惊呼道，“嗨，你疯啦，我的小紫罗兰！——真是疯了，我的小牡丹！她已经这么冰凉啦，她的手几乎把我的手给冻坏了，尽管我戴着厚厚的手套。你们想让她冻死吗！”

在他走上台阶的时候，妻子又久久地凝视着陌生的白衣小姑娘，目光热切，几乎充满了敬畏。她不知道这是不是一场梦，但她总觉得自己看到这孩子的脖子上印着紫罗兰细小的手指印。大概紫罗兰在堆雪人的时候曾经用手轻轻地拍过她一下，却忘了把迹印抹平。

“不管怎么说，我的丈夫，”母亲再次想起天使们也许会跟她自己一样，很高兴同紫罗兰和牡丹一起玩，“不管怎么说，这孩子的确出奇地像个雪人！我相信她是雪做成的！”

一阵西风刮到雪孩子身上，她又像一颗星星那样闪光了。

“雪做成的！”林赛先生重复道，硬把不情愿的客人拉进他那殷勤好客的房门，“难怪她看上去就像雪。她都冻得半死啦，可怜的小家伙！不过旺旺的一炉火就能使她一切正常！”

这位极其仁慈和富于常识的好人不再多说，而且怀着一贯的良好愿望，把白衣小姑娘拽离严寒的户外，带进了舒适的客厅；而小姑娘则垂头丧气，越来越萎靡不振。客厅里一只海德堡火炉里填满了熊熊燃烧的无烟煤，正透过铁门上的云母薄板射出明亮的火光，把炉子上的水壶烧得雾气腾腾，咕咕欢唱。一股温暖闷人的气息弥漫在整个房间里。离炉子最远的一面墙上挂着一只温度计，显示着八十度(1)。客厅里挂着红色窗帘，铺着红色地毯，看上去和室内的温度一样使人感到暖融融的。这儿的气氛同室外寒冷的冬日黄昏真有天壤之别，正像从新地岛(2)一步跨入印度最热的地区，或者从北极一下子钻进了火炉。啊，这对陌生的白衣小姑娘可真是个好地方！

那位通晓常识的人让雪孩子站在炉前的地毯上，正对着嘶嘶作响、腾腾冒气的火炉。

“现在她会感觉舒服啦！”林赛先生高声说，一边搓着双手，环顾左右，脸上露出你所见过的最愉悦的微笑。“就跟在自己家里一样别拘束，我的孩子。”

白衣小姑娘站在炉前的地毯上，炉火的热浪像瘟疫一样猛扑过来，她显得是那么忧伤，忧伤而又消沉。有那么一次，她渴望地朝窗外投去一道目光，透过红色窗帘瞥见了白雪覆盖的屋顶，闪着寒光的星星，以及寒夜一切激动人心的美妙景象。寒风吹得窗户玻璃咯咯作响，仿佛正在召唤她前去，可是雪孩子却站在火热的炉前，越来越萎靡！

然而，通晓常识的林赛先生却看不出有什么不恰当。

“好啦，太太，”他说，“马上给她穿一双厚袜子，裹一条羊毛披巾或者毯子；告诉朵拉，牛奶一烧开就给她吃点暖和的东西当晚饭。你们，紫罗兰和牡丹，逗你们的小朋友开开心。你们看看，她发现自己来到一个陌生的地方，是那么没精打采。至于我嘛，要去几家邻居那儿转转，弄清楚她是谁家的孩子。”

这时候母亲就去找披巾和袜子，因为无论她生性多么敏感而细腻，到头来自己的观点总是会向丈夫顽固的实利主义让步。林赛先生毫不理睬两个孩子的抗议，任他们咕哝着说什么小雪妹妹不喜欢暖和，径直走了出去，还小心地回手把客厅门关好。他把大衣领子翻上去罩住耳朵，走出了屋子，刚走到临街的大门前，就听到紫罗兰和牡丹在尖声叫他回来，还有一只戴着顶针的手指在敲客厅的窗户。

“丈夫！丈夫！”妻子喊道，她惊恐的脸出现在窗户玻璃后面，“用不着去找孩子的父母啦！”

“我们告诉过你的，父亲！”当他回到客厅里的时候，紫罗兰和牡丹尖叫着说，“你非要带她进来；现在我们可怜的——可爱的——美丽的小雪妹妹融化了！”

两个孩子自己可爱的小脸蛋也融化出了滔滔泪水；父亲看到在这平凡无奇的世界上竟会偶尔发生这等怪事，于是颇为忧虑自己的孩子也会融化掉！他怀着极度的困惑，要求妻子给他解释一下，而她只能回答说，自己被紫罗兰和牡丹的叫喊声唤回客厅，发现白衣小姑娘已经渺无踪影，只留下一堆白雪，就在她仔细查看的时候，白雪也快在地毯上融化光了。

“你看那儿，就只剩下这个啦！”她补充说，指着炉子跟前的一汪水。

“是呀，爸爸，”紫罗兰说，她透过泪水用责备的目光看着他，“我们可爱的小雪妹妹只剩下一摊水啦！”

“讨厌的爸爸！”牡丹跺着脚喊道——我讲到这儿发起抖来——他还朝那位通晓常识的人挥舞着小拳头哩，“我们告诉过你会发生什么事！你为什么非要拉她进来？”

海德堡火炉似乎也透过铁门上的云母薄板对好心的林赛先生怒目而视，就像一个红眼魔鬼，为自己的恶作剧而扬扬得意！

你会说这是一桩罕见的怪事，然而它也会偶尔发生，常识一碰上这种事就不知所措。对于林赛先生所属的那个精明阶层的人来说，尽管小雪人的奇特故事或许只是件孩子气的傻事，然而也可以按照不同方式引出种种教训，给他们带来巨大的启示。譬如说教训之一就是，人们，尤其是心地仁慈的人们，应该预先考虑清楚自己要做的事，在按照自己的慈善目的行动之前，应该确信自己弄清了行动的性质和一切与之相关的东西。对某一个人而言是确凿无疑的有益之事，对另一个人来说则可能是绝对的灾祸。即使是客厅的温暖吧，对于像紫罗兰和牡丹这样的血肉之躯可谓适宜——尽管并不能说对他们的健康就非常有益——但对于不幸的小雪人来说，却只会导致毁灭。

但是，说到底，对于林赛先生这种类型的聪明人而言，是不可能引出任何教训的。他们通晓一切——啊，的确！——包括过去的一切，现在的一切，将来可能发生的一切。假如有某种源于自然或者出于天意的现象超越了他们的思维，他们是辨认不出来的，哪怕就在他们的鼻子尖下面发生。

“太太，”林赛先生在沉默片刻之后说，“你看孩子们的脚带进来多少雪啊！弄得炉子前面那么大一摊水。叫朵拉拿几条毛巾来吸干它！”

HAWTHORNE'S SHORT STORIES




Nathaniel Hawthorne





DR. HEIDEGGER'S EXPERIMENT


That very singular man, old Dr. Heidegger, once invited four venerable friends to meet him in his study. There were three white-bearded gentlemen, Mr. Medbourne, Colonel Killigrew, and Mr. Gascoigne, and a withered gentlewoman whose name was the Widow Wycherly. They were all melancholy old creatures, who had been unfortunate in life, and whose greatest misfortune it was that they were not long ago in their graves. Mr. Medbourne, in the vigor of his age, had been a prosperous merchant, but had lost his all by a frantic speculation, and was now little better than a mendicant. Colonel Killigrew had wasted his best years, and his health and substance, in the pursuit of sinful pleasures, which had given birth to a brood of pains, such as the gout, and divers other torments of soul and body. Mr. Gascoigne was a ruined politician, a man of evil fame, or at least had been so till time had buried him from the knowledge of the present generation, and made him obscure instead of infamous. As for the Widow Wycherly, tradition tells us that she was a great beauty in her day; but, for a long while past, she had lived in deep seclusion, on account of certain scandalous stories which had prejudiced the gentry of the town against her. It is a circumstance worth mentioning that each of these three old gentlemen, Mr. Medbourne, Colonel Killigrew, and Mr. Gascoigne, were early lovers of the Widow Wycherly, and had once been on the point of cutting each other's throats for her sake. And, before proceeding further, I will merely hint that Dr. Heidegger and all his four guests were sometimes thought to be a little beside themselves,—as is not unfrequently the case with old people, when worried either by present troubles or woful recollections.

“My dear old friends,”said Dr. Heidegger, motioning them to be seated,“I am desirous of your assistance in one of those little experiments with which I amuse myself here in my study.”

If all stories were true, Dr. Heidegger's study must have been a very curious place. It was a dim, old-fashioned chamber, festooned with cobwebs, and besprinkled with antique dust. Around the walls stood several oaken bookcases, the lower shelves of which were filled with rows of gigantic folios and black-letter quartos, and the upper with little parchment-covered duodecimos. Over the central bookcase was a bronze bust of Hippocrates, with which, according to some authorities, Dr. Heidegger was accustomed to hold consultations in all difficult cases of his practice. In the obscurest corner of the room stood a tall and narrow oaken closet, with its door ajar, within which doubtfully appeared a skeleton. Between two of the bookcases hung a looking-glass, presenting its high and dusty plate within a tarnished gilt frame. Among many wonderful stories related of this mirror, it was fabled that the spirits of all the doctor's deceased patients dwelt within its verge, and would stare him in the face whenever he looked thitherward. The opposite side of the chamber was ornamented with the full-length portrait of a young lady, arrayed in the faded magnificence of silk, satin, and brocade, and with a visage as faded as her dress. Above half a century ago, Dr. Heidegger had been on the point of marriage with this young lady; but, being affected with some slight disorder, she had swallowed one of her lover's prescriptions, and died on the bridal evening. The greatest curiosity of the study remains to be mentioned; it was a ponderous folio volume, bound in black leather, with massive silver clasps. There were no letters on the back, and nobody could tell the title of the book. But it was well known to be a book of magic; and once, when a chambermaid had lifted it, merely to brush away the dust, the skeleton had rattled in its closet, the picture of the young lady had stepped one foot upon the floor, and several ghastly faces had peeped forth from the mirror; while the brazen head of Hippocrates frowned and said,—“Forbear!”

Such was Dr. Heidegger's study. On the summer afternoon of our tale a small round table, as black as ebony, stood in the centre of the room, sustaining a cut-glass vase of beautiful form and elaborate workmanship. The sunshine came through the window between the heavy festoons of two faded damask curtains, and fell directly across this vase; so that a mild splendor was reflected from it on the ashen visages of the five old people who sat around. Four champagne glasses were also on the table.

“My dear old friends,”repeated Dr. Heidegger,“may I reckon on your aid in performing an exceedingly curious experiment?”

Now Dr. Heidegger was a very strange old gentleman, whose eccentricity had become the nucleus for a thousand fantastic stories. Some of these fables, to my shame be it spoken, might possibly be traced back to my own veracious self; and if any passages of the present tale should startle the reader's faith, I must be content to bear the stigma of a fiction monger.

When the doctor's four guests heard him talk of his proposed experiment, they anticipated nothing more wonderful than the murder of a mouse in an air pump, or the examination of a cobweb by the microscope, or some similar nonsense, with which he was constantly in the habit of pestering his intimates. But without waiting for a reply, Dr. Heidegger hobbled across the chamber, and returned with the same ponderous folio, bound in black leather which common report affirmed to be a book of magic. Undoing the silver clasps, he opened the volume, and took from among its black-letter pages a rose, or what was once a rose, though now the green leaves and crimson petals had assumed one brownish hue, and the ancient flower seemed ready to crumble to dust in the doctor's hands.

“This rose,”said Dr. Heidegger, with a sigh,“this same withered and crumbling flower, blossomed five and fifty years ago. It was given me by Sylvia Ward, whose portrait hangs yonder; and I meant to wear it in my bosom at our wedding. Five and fifty years it has been treasured between the leaves of this old volume. Now, would you deem it possible that this rose of half a century could ever bloom again?”

“Nonsense!”said the Widow Wycherly, with a peevish toss of her head.“You might as well ask whether an old woman's wrinkled face could ever bloom again.”

“See!”answered Dr. Heidegger.

He uncovered the vase, and threw the faded rose into the water which it contained. At first, it lay lightly on the surface of the fluid, appearing to imbibe none of its moisture. Soon, however, a singular change began to be visible. The crushed and dried petals stirred, and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson, as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber; the slender stalk and twigs of foliage became green; and there was the rose of half a century, looking as fresh as when Sylvia Ward had first given it to her lover. It was scarcely full blown; for some of its delicate red leaves curled modestly around its moist bosom, within which two or three dewdrops were sparkling.

“That is certainly a very pretty deception,”said the doctor's friends; carelessly, however, for they had witnessed greater miracles at a conjurer's show;“pray how was it effected?”

“Did you never hear of the 'Fountain of Youth?'”asked Dr. Heidegger,“which Ponce De Leon, the Spanish adventurer, went in search of two or three centuries ago?”

“But did Ponce De Leon ever find it?”said the Widow Wycherly.

“No,”answered Dr. Heidegger,“for he never sought it in the right place. The famous Fountain of Youth, if I am rightly informed, is situated in the southern part of the Floridian peninsula, not far from Lake Macaco. Its source is overshadowed by several gigantic magnolias, which, though numberless centuries old, have been kept as fresh as violets by the virtues of this wonderful water. An acquaintance of mine, knowing my curiosity in such matters, has sent me what you see in the vase.”

“Ahem!”said Colonel Killigrew, who believed not a word of the doctor's story;“and what may be the effect of this fluid on the human frame?”

“You shall judge for yourself, my dear colonel,”replied Dr. Heidegger;“and all of you, my respected friends, are welcome to so much of this admirable fluid as may restore to you the bloom of youth. For my own part, having had much trouble in growing old, I am in no hurry to grow young again. With your permission, therefore, I will merely watch the progress of the experiment.”

While he spoke, Dr. Heidegger had been filling the four champagne glasses with the water of the Fountain of Youth. It was apparently impregnated with an effervescent gas, for little bubbles were continually ascending from the depths of the glasses, and bursting in silvery spray at the surface. As the liquor diffused a pleasant perfume, the old people doubted not that it possessed cordial and comfortable properties; and though utter sceptics as to its rejuvenescent power, they were inclined to swallow it at once. But Dr. Heidegger besought them to stay a moment.

“Before you drink, my respectable old friends,”said he,“it would be well that, with the experience of a lifetime to direct you, you should draw up a few general rules for your guidance, in passing a second time through the perils of youth. Think what a sin and shame it would be, if, with your peculiar advantages, you should not become patterns of virtue and wisdom to all the young people of the age!”

The doctor's four venerable friends made him no answer, except by a feeble and tremulous laugh; so very ridiculous was the idea that, knowing how closely repentance treads behind the steps of error, they should ever go astray again.

“Drink, then,”said the doctor, bowing;“I rejoice that I have so well selected the subjects of my experiment.”

With palsied hands, they raised the glasses to their lips. The liquor, if it really possessed such virtues as Dr. Heidegger imputed to it, could not have been bestowed on four human beings who needed it more wofully. They looked as if they had never known what youth or pleasure was, but had been the offspring of Nature's dotage, and always the gray, decrepit, sapless, miserable creatures, who now sat stooping round the doctor's table, without life enough in their souls or bodies to be animated even by the prospect of growing young again. They drank off the water, and replaced their glasses on the table.

Assuredly there was an almost immediate improvement in the aspect of the party, not unlike what might have been produced by a glass of generous wine, together with a sudden glow of cheerful sunshine brightening over all their visages at once. There was a healthful suffusion on their cheeks, instead of the ashen hue that had made them look so corpse-like. They gazed at one another, and fancied that some magic power had really begun to smooth away the deep and sad inscriptions which Father Time had been so long engraving on their brows. The Widow Wycherly adjusted her cap, for she felt almost like a woman again.

“Give us more of this wondrous water!”cried they, eagerly.“We are younger—but we are still too old. Quick—give us more!”

“Patience, patience!”quoth Dr. Heidegger, who sat watching the experiment with philosophic coolness.“You have been a long time growing old. Surely, you might be content to grow young in half an hour! But the water is at your service.”

Again he filled their glasses with the liquor of youth, enough of which still remained in the vase to turn half the old people in the city to the age of their own grandchildren. While the bubbles were yet sparkling on the brim, the doctor's four guests snatched their glasses from the table, and swallowed the contents at a single gulp. Was it delusion? Even while the draught was passing down their throats, it seemed to have wrought a change on their whole systems. Their eyes grew clear and bright; a dark shade deepened among their silvery locks, they sat around the table, three gentlemen of middle age, and a woman, hardly beyond her buxom prime.

“My dear widow, you are charming!”cried Colonel Killigrew, whose eyes had been fixed upon her face, while the shadows of age were flitting from it like darkness from the crimson daybreak.

The fair widow knew, of old, that Colonel Killigrew's com-pliments were not always measured by sober truth; so she started up and ran to the mirror, still dreading that the ugly visage of an old woman would meet her gaze. Meanwhile, the three gentlemen behaved in such a manner as proved that the water of the Fountain of Youth possessed some intoxicating qualities; unless, indeed, their exhilaration of spirits were merely a lightsome dizziness caused by the sudden removal of the weight of years. Mr. Gascoigne's mind seemed to run on political topics, but whether relating to the past, present, or future, could not easily be determined, since the same ideas and phrases have been in vogue these fifty years. Now he rattled forth full-throated sentences about patriotism, national glory, and the people's right; now he muttered some perilous stuff or other, in a sly and doubtful whisper, so cautiously that even his own conscience could scarcely catch the secret; and now, again, he spoke in measured accents, and a deeply deferential tone, as if a royal ear were listening to his well-turned periods. Colonel Killigrew all this time had been trolling forth a jolly bottle song, and ringing his glass in symphony with the chorus, while his eyes wandered toward the buxom figure of the Widow Wycherly. On the other side of the table, Mr. Medbourne was involved in a calculation of dollars and cents, with which was strangely intermingled a project for supplying the East Indies with ice, by harnessing a team of whales to the polar icebergs.

As for the Widow Wycherly, she stood before the mirror courtesying and simpering to her own image, and greeting it as the friend whom she loved better than all the world beside. She thrust her face close to the glass, to see whether some long-remembered wrinkle or crow's foot had indeed vanished. She examined whether the snow had so entirely melted from her hair that the venerable cap could be safely thrown aside. At last, turning briskly away, she came with a sort of dancing step to the table.

“My dear old doctor,”cried she,“pray favor me with another glass!”

“Certainly, my dear madam, certainly!”replied the complaisant doctor;“see! I have already filled the glasses.”

There, in fact, stood the four glasses, brimful of this wonderful water, the delicate spray of which, as it effervesced from the surface, resembled the tremulous glitter of diamonds. It was now so nearly sunset that the chamber had grown duskier than ever; but a mild and moonlike splendor gleamed from within the vase, and rested alike on the four guests and on the doctor's venerable figure. He sat in a high-backed, elaborately-carved, oaken arm-chair, with a gray dignity of aspect that might have well befitted that very Father Time, whose power had never been disputed, save by this fortunate company. Even while quaffing the third draught of the Fountain of Youth, they were almost awed by the expression of his mysterious visage.

But, the next moment, the exhilarating gush of young life shot through their veins. They were now in the happy prime of youth. Age, with its miserable train of cares and sorrows and diseases, was remembered only as the trouble of a dream, from which they had joyously awoke. The fresh gloss of the soul, so early lost, and without which the world's successive scenes had been but a gallery of faded pictures, again threw its enchantment over all their prospects. They felt like new-created beings in a new-created universe.

“We are young! We are young!”they cried exultingly.

Youth, like the extremity of age, had effaced the strongly-marked characteristics of middle life, and mutually assimilated them all. They were a group of merry youngsters, almost maddened with the exuberant frolicsomeness of their years. The most singular effect of their gayety was an impulse to mock the infirmity and decrepitude of which they had so lately been the victims. They laughed loudly at their old-fashioned attire, the wide-skirted coats and flapped waistcoats of the young men, and the ancient cap and gown of the blooming girl. One limped across the floor like a gouty grandfather; one set a pair of spectacles astride of his nose, and pretended to pore over the black-letter pages of the book of magic; a third seated himself in an arm-chair, and strove to imitate the venerable dignity of Dr. Heidegger. Then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. The Widow Wycherly—if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow—tripped up to the doctor's chair, with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face.

“Doctor, you dear old soul,”cried she,“get up and dance with me!”

And then the four young people laughed louder than ever, to think what a queer figure the poor old doctor would cut.

“Pray excuse me,”answered the doctor quietly.“I am old and rheumatic, and my dancing days were over long ago. But either of these gay young gentlemen will be glad of so pretty a partner.”

“Dance with me, Clara!”cried Colonel Killigrew.

“No, no, I will be her partner!”shouted Mr. Gascoigne.

“She promised me her hand, fifty years ago!”exclaimed Mr. Medbourne.

They all gathered round her. One caught both her hands in his passionate grasp—another threw his arm about her waist—the third buried his hand among the glossy curls that clustered beneath the widow's cap. Blushing, panting, struggling, chiding, laughing, her warm breath fanning each of their faces by turns, she strove to disengage herself, yet still remained in their triple embrace. Never was there a livelier picture of youthful rivalship, with bewitching beauty for the prize. Yet, by a strange deception, owing to the duskiness of the chamber, and the antique dresses which they still wore, the tall mirror is said to have reflected the figures of the three old, gray, withered grandsires ridiculously contending for the skinny ugliness of a shrivelled grandam.

But they were young: their burning passions proved them so. Inflamed to madness by the coquetry of the girl-widow, who neither granted nor quite withheld her favors, the three rivals began to interchange threatening glances. Still keeping hold of the fair prize, they grappled fiercely at one another's throats. As they struggled to and fro, the table was overturned, and the vase dashed into a thousand fragments. The precious Water of Youth flowed in a bright stream across the floor, moistening the wings of a butterfly, which, grown old in the decline of summer, had alighted there to die. The insect fluttered lightly through the chamber, and settled on the snowy head of Dr. Heidegger.

“Come, come, gentlemen!—come, Madam Wycherly,”exclaimed the doctor,“I really must protest against this riot.”

They stood still and shivered; for it seemed as if gray Time were calling them back from their sunny youth, far down into the chill and darksome vale of years. They looked at old Dr. Heidegger, who sat in his carved arm-chair, holding the rose of half a century, which he had rescued from among the fragments of the shattered vase. At the motion of his hand, the four rioters resumed their seats; the more readily, because their violent exertions had wearied them, youthful though they were.

“My poor Sylvia's rose!”ejaculated Dr. Heidegger, holding it in the light of the sunset clouds;“it appears to be fading again.”

And so it was. Even while the party were looking at it, the flower continued to shrivel up, till it became as dry and fragile as when the doctor had first thrown it into the vase. He shook off the few drops of moisture which clung to its petals.

“I love it as well thus as in its dewy freshness,”observed he, pressing the withered rose to his withered lips. While he spoke, the butterfly fluttered down from the doctor's snowy head, and fell upon the floor.

His guests shivered again. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm, and left a deepening furrow where none had been before. Was it an illusion? Had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space, and were they now four aged people, sitting with their old friend, Dr. Heidegger?

“Are we grown old again, so soon?”cried they, dolefully.

In truth they had. The Water of Youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine. The delirium which it created had effervesced away. Yes! they were old again. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.

“Yes, friends, ye are old again,”said Dr. Heidegger,“and, lo! the Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground. Well—I bemoan it not; for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep, I would not stoop to bathe my lips in it—no, though its delirium were for years instead of moments. Such is the lesson ye have taught me!”

But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.





THE BIRTHMARK


In the latter part of the last century there lived a man of science, an eminent proficient in every branch of natural philosophy, who not long before our story opens had made experience of a spiritual affinity more attractive than any chemical one. He had left his laboratory to the care of an assistant, cleared his fine countenance from the furnace smoke, washed the stain of acids from his fingers, and persuaded a beautiful woman to become his wife. In those days when the comparatively recent discovery of electricity and other kindred mysteries of Nature seemed to open paths into the region of miracle, it was not unusual for the love of science to rival the love of woman in its depth and absorbing energy. The higher intellect, the imagination, the spirit, and even the heart might all find their congenial aliment in pursuits which, as some of their ardent votaries believed, would ascend from one step of powerful intelligence to another, until the philosopher should lay his hand on the secret of creative force and perhaps make new worlds for himself. We know not whether Aylmer possessed this degree of faith in man's ultimate control over Nature. He had devoted himself, however, too unreservedly to scientific studies ever to be weaned from them by any second passion. His love for his young wife might prove the stronger of the two; but it could only be by intertwining itself with his love of science, and uniting the strength of the latter to his own.

Such a union accordingly took place, and was attended with truly remarkable consequences and a deeply impressive moral. One day, very soon after their marriage, Aylmer sat gazing at his wife with a trouble in his countenance that grew stronger until he spoke.

“Georgiana,”said he,“has it never occurred to you that the mark upon your cheek might be removed?”

“No, indeed,”said she, smiling; but perceiving the seriousness of his manner, she blushed deeply.“To tell you the truth it has been so often called a charm that I was simple enough to imagine it might be so.”

“Ah, upon another face perhaps it might,”replied her husband;“but never on yours. No, dearest Georgiana, you came so nearly perfect from the hand of Nature that this slightest possible defect, which we hesitate whether to term a defect or a beauty, shocks me, as being the visible mark of earthly imperfection.”

“Shocks you, my husband!”cried Georgiana, deeply hurt; at first reddening with momentary anger, but then bursting into tears.“Then why did you take me from my mother's side? You cannot love what shocks you!”

To explain this conversation it must be mentioned that in the centre of Georgiana's left cheek there was a singular mark, deeply interwoven, as it were, with the texture and substance of her face. In the usual state of her complexion—a healthy though delicate bloom—the mark wore a tint of deeper crimson, which imperfectly defined its shape amid the surrounding rosiness. When she blushed it gradually became more indistinct, and finally vanished amid the triumphant rush of blood that bathed the whole cheek with its brilliant glow. But if any shifting motion caused her to turn pale there was the mark again, a crimson stain upon the snow, in what Aylmer sometimes deemed an almost fearful distinctness. Its shape bore not a little similarity to the human hand, though of the smallest pygmy size. Georgiana's lovers were wont to say that some fairy at her birth hour had laid her tiny hand upon the infant's cheek, and left this impress there in token of the magic endowments that were to give her such sway over all hearts. Many a desperate swain would have risked life for the privilege of pressing his lips to the mysterious hand. It must not be concealed, however, that the impression wrought by this fairy sign manual varied exceedingly, according to the difference of temperament in the beholders. Some fastidious persons—but they were exclusively of her own sex—affirmed that the bloody hand, as they chose to call it, quite destroyed the effect of Georgiana's beauty, and rendered her countenance even hideous. But it would be as reasonable to say that one of those small blue stains which sometimes occur in the purest statuary marble would convert the Eve of Powers to a monster. Masculine observers, if the birthmark did not heighten their admiration, contented themselves with wishing it away, that the world might possess one living specimen of ideal loveliness without the semblance of a flaw. After his marriage,—for he thought little or nothing of the matter before,—Aylmer discovered that this was the case with himself.

Had she been less beautiful,—if Envy's self could have found aught else to sneer at,—he might have felt his affection heightened by the prettiness of this mimic hand, now vaguely portrayed, now lost, now stealing forth again and glimmering to and fro with every pulse of emotion that throbbed within her heart; but seeing her otherwise so perfect, he found this one defect grow more and more intolerable with every moment of their united lives. It was the fatal flaw of humanity which Nature, in one shape or another, stamps ineffaceably on all her productions, either to imply that they are temporary and finite, or that their perfection must be wrought by toil and pain. The crimson hand expressed the ineludible gripe in which mortality clutches the highest and purest of earthly mould, degrading them into kindred with the lowest, and even with the very brutes, like whom their visible frames return to dust. In this manner, selecting it as the symbol of his wife's liability to sin, sorrow, decay, and death, Aylmer's sombre imagination was not long in rendering the birthmark a frightful object, causing him more trouble and horror than ever Georgiana's beauty, whether of soul or sense, had given him delight.

At all the seasons which should have been their happiest, he invariably and without intending it, nay, in spite of a purpose to the contrary, reverted to this one disastrous topic. Trifling as it at first appeared, it so connected itself with innumerable trains of thought and modes of feeling that it became the central point of all. With the morning twilight Aylmer opened his eyes upon his wife's face and recognized the symbol of imperfection; and when they sat together at the evening hearth his eyes wandered stealthily to her cheek, and beheld, flickering with the blaze of the wood fire, the spectral hand that wrote mortality where he would fain have worshipped. Georgiana soon learned to shudder at his gaze. It needed but a glance with the peculiar expression that his face often wore to change the roses of her cheek into a deathlike paleness, amid which the crimson hand was brought strongly out, like a bass-relief of ruby on the whitest marble.

Late one night when the lights were growing dim, so as hardly to betray the stain on the poor wife's cheek, she herself, for the first time, voluntarily took up the subject.

“Do you remember, my dear Aylmer,”said she, with a feeble attempt at a smile,“have you any recollection of a dream last night about this odious hand?”

“None! none whatever!”replied Aylmer, starting; but then he added, in a dry, cold tone, affected for the sake of concealing the real depth of his emotion,“I might well dream of it; for before I fell asleep it had taken a pretty firm hold of my fancy.”

“And you did dream of it?”continued Georgiana, hastily; for she dreaded lest a gush of tears should interrupt what she had to say.“A terrible dream! I wonder that you can forget it. Is it possible to forget this one expression?—'It is in her heart now; we must have it out!' Reflect, my husband; for by all means I would have you recall that dream.”

The mind is in a sad state when Sleep, the all-involving, cannot confine her spectres within the dim region of her sway, but suffers them to break forth, affrighting this actual life with secrets that perchance belong to a deeper one. Aylmer now remembered his dream. He had fancied himself with his servant Aminadab, attempting an operation for the removal of the birthmark; but the deeper went the knife, the deeper sank the hand, until at length its tiny grasp appeared to have caught hold of Georgiana's heart; whence, however, her husband was inexorably resolved to cut or wrench it away.

When the dream had shaped itself perfectly in his memory, Aylmer sat in his wife's presence with a guilty feeling. Truth often finds its way to the mind close muffled in robes of sleep, and then speaks with uncompromising directness of matters in regard to which we practise an unconscious self-deception during our waking moments. Until now he had not been aware of the tyrannizing influence acquired by one idea over his mind, and of the lengths which he might find in his heart to go for the sake of giving himself peace.

“Aylmer,”resumed Georgiana, solemnly,“I know not what may be the cost to both of us to rid me of this fatal birthmark. Perhaps its removal may cause cureless deformity; or it may be the stain goes as deep as life itself. Again: do we know that there is a possibility, on any terms, of unclasping the firm gripe of this little hand which was laid upon me before I came into the world?”

“Dearest Georgiana, I have spent much thought upon the subject,”hastily interrupted Aylmer.“I am convinced of the perfect practicability of its removal.”

“If there be the remotest possibility of it,”continued Georgiana,“let the attempt be made at whatever risk. Danger is nothing to me; for life, while this hateful mark makes me the object of your horror and disgust,—life is a burden which I would fling down with joy. Either remove this dreadful hand, or take my wretched life! You have deep science. All the world bears witness of it. You have achieved great wonders. Cannot you remove this little, little mark, which I cover with the tips of two small fingers? Is this beyond your power, for the sake of your own peace, and to save your poor wife from madness?”

“Noblest, dearest, tenderest wife,”cried Aylmer, rapturously,“doubt not my power. I have already given this matter the deepest thought—thought which might almost have enlightened me to create a being less perfect than yourself. Georgiana, you have led me deeper than ever into the heart of science. I feel myself fully competent to render this dear cheek as faultless as its fellow; and then, most beloved, what will be my triumph when I shall have corrected what Nature left imperfect in her fairest work! Even Pygmalion, when his sculptured woman assumed life, felt not greater ecstasy than mine will be.”

“It is resolved, then,”said Georgiana, faintly smiling.“And, Aylmer, spare me not, though you should find the birthmark take refuge in my heart at last.”

Her husband tenderly kissed her cheek—her right cheek—not that which bore the impress of the crimson hand.

The next day Aylmer apprised his wife of a plan that he had formed whereby he might have opportunity for the intense thought and constant watchfulness which the proposed operation would require; while Georgiana, likewise, would enjoy the perfect repose essential to its success. They were to seclude themselves in the extensive apartments occupied by Aylmer as a laboratory, and where, during his toilsome youth, he had made discoveries in the elemental powers of Nature that had roused the admiration of all the learned societies in Europe. Seated calmly in this laboratory, the pale philosopher had investigated the secrets of the highest cloud region and of the profoundest mines; he had satisfied himself of the causes that kindled and kept alive the fires of the volcano; and had explained the mystery of fountains, and how it is that they gush forth, some so bright and pure, and others with such rich medicinal virtues, from the dark bosom of the earth. Here, too, at an earlier period, he had studied the wonders of the human frame, and attempted to fathom the very process by which Nature assimilates all her precious influences from earth and air, and from the spiritual world, to create and foster man, her masterpiece. The latter pursuit, however, Aylmer had long laid aside in unwilling recognition of the truth—against which all seekers sooner or later stumble—that our great creative Mother, while she amuses us with apparently working in the broadest sunshine, is yet severely careful to keep her own secrets, and, in spite of her pretended openness, shows us nothing but results. She permits us, indeed, to mar, but seldom to mend, and, like a jealous patentee, on no account to make. Now, however, Aylmer resumed these half-forgotten investigations; not, of course, with such hopes or wishes as first suggested them; but because they involved much physiological truth and lay in the path of his proposed scheme for the treatment of Georgiana.

As he led her over the threshold of the laboratory, Georgiana was cold and tremulous. Aylmer looked cheerfully into her face, with intent to reassure her, but was so startled with the intense glow of the birthmark upon the whiteness of her cheek that he could not restrain a strong convulsive shudder. His wife fainted.

“Aminadab! Aminadab!”shouted Aylmer, stamping violently on the floor.

Forthwith there issued from an inner apartment a man of low stature, but bulky frame, with shaggy hair hanging about his visage, which was grimed with the vapors of the furnace. This personage had been Aylmer's underworker during his whole scientific career, and was admirably fitted for that office by his great mechanical readiness, and the skill with which, while incapable of comprehending a single principle, he executed all the details of his master's experiments. With his vast strength, his shaggy hair, his smoky aspect, and the indescribable earthiness that incrusted him, he seemed to represent man's physical nature; while Aylmer's slender figure, and pale, intellectual face, were no less apt a type of the spiritual element.

“Throw open the door of the boudoir, Aminadab,”said Aylmer,“and burn a pastil.”

“Yes, master,”answered Aminadab, looking intently at the lifeless form of Georgiana; and then he muttered to himself,“If she were my wife, I'd never part with that birthmark.”

When Georgiana recovered consciousness she found herself breathing an atmosphere of penetrating fragrance, the gentle potency of which had recalled her from her deathlike faintness. The scene around her looked like enchantment. Aylmer had converted those smoky, dingy, sombre rooms, where he had spent his brightest years in recondite pursuits, into a series of beautiful apartments not unfit to be the secluded abode of a lovely woman. The walls were hung with gorgeous curtains, which imparted the combination of grandeur and grace that no other species of adornment can achieve; and as they fell from the ceiling to the floor, their rich and ponderous folds, concealing all angles and straight lines, appeared to shut in the scene from infinite space. For aught Georgiana knew, it might be a pavilion among the clouds. And Aylmer, excluding the sunshine, which would have interfered with his chemical processes, had supplied its place with perfumed lamps, emitting flames of various hue, but all uniting in a soft, impurpled radiance. He now knelt by his wife's side, watching her earnestly, but without alarm; for he was confident in his science, and felt that he could draw a magic circle round her within which no evil might intrude.

“Where am I? Ah, I remember,”said Georgiana, faintly; and she placed her hand over her cheek to hide the terrible mark from her husband's eyes.

“Fear not, dearest!”exclaimed he.“Do not shrink from me! Believe me, Georgiana, I even rejoice in this single imperfection, since it will be such a rapture to remove it.”

“Oh, spare me!”sadly replied his wife.“Pray do not look at it again. I never can forget that convulsive shudder.”

In order to soothe Georgiana, and, as it were, to release her mind from the burden of actual things, Aylmer now put in practice some of the light and playful secrets which science had taught him among its profounder lore. Airy figures, absolutely bodiless ideas, and forms of unsubstantial beauty came and danced before her, imprinting their momentary footsteps on beams of light. Though she had some indistinct idea of the method of these optical phenomena, still the illusion was almost perfect enough to warrant the belief that her husband possessed sway over the spiritual world. Then again, when she felt a wish to look forth from her seclusion, immediately, as if her thoughts were answered, the procession of external existence flitted across a screen. The scenery and the figures of actual life were perfectly represented, but with that bewitching, yet indescribable difference which always makes a picture, an image, or a shadow so much more attractive than the original. When wearied of this, Aylmer bade her cast her eyes upon a vessel containing a quantity of earth. She did so, with little interest at first; but was soon startled to perceive the germ of a plant shooting upward from the soil. Then came the slender stalk; the leaves gradually unfolded themselves; and amid them was a perfect and lovely flower.

“It is magical!”cried Georgiana.“I dare not touch it.”

“Nay, pluck it,”answered Aylmer,—“pluck it, and inhale its brief perfume while you may. The flower will wither in a few moments and leave nothing save its brown seed vessels; but thence may be perpetuated a race as ephemeral as itself.”

But Georgiana had no sooner touched the flower than the whole plant suffered a blight, its leaves turning coal-black as if by the agency of fire.

“There was too powerful a stimulus,”said Aylmer, thoughtfully.

To make up for this abortive experiment, he proposed to take her portrait by a scientific process of his own invention. It was to be effected by rays of light striking upon a polished plate of metal. Georgiana assented; but, on looking at the result, was affrighted to find the features of the portrait blurred and indefinable; while the minute figure of a hand appeared where the cheek should have been. Aylmer snatched the metallic plate and threw it into a jar of corrosive acid.

Soon, however, he forgot these mortifying failures. In the intervals of study and chemical experiment he came to her flushed and exhausted, but seemed invigorated by her presence, and spoke in glowing language of the resources of his art. He gave a history of the long dynasty of the alchemists, who spent so many ages in quest of the universal solvent by which the golden principle might be elicited from all things vile and base. Aylmer appeared to believe that, by the plainest scientific logic, it was altogether within the limits of possibility to discover this long-sought medium;“but,”he added,“a philosopher who should go deep enough to acquire the power would attain too lofty a wisdom to stoop to the exercise of it.”Not less singular were his opinions in regard to the elixir vitae. He more than intimated that it was at his option to concoct a liquid that should prolong life for years, perhaps interminably; but that it would produce a discord in Nature which all the world, and chiefly the quaffer of the immortal nostrum, would find cause to curse.

“Aylmer, are you in earnest?”asked Georgiana, looking at him with amazement and fear.“It is terrible to possess such power, or even to dream of possessing it.”

“Oh, do not tremble, my love,”said her husband.“I would not wrong either you or myself by working such inharmonious effects upon our lives; but I would have you consider how trifling, in comparison, is the skill requisite to remove this little hand.”

At the mention of the birthmark, Georgiana, as usual, shrank as if a redhot iron had touched her cheek.

Again Aylmer applied himself to his labors. She could hear his voice in the distant furnace room giving directions to Aminadab, whose harsh, uncouth, misshapen tones were audible in response, more like the grunt or growl of a brute than human speech. After hours of absence, Aylmer reappeared and proposed that she should now examine his cabinet of chemical products and natural treasures of the earth. Among the former he showed her a small vial, in which, he remarked, was contained a gentle yet most powerful fragrance, capable of impregnating all the breezes that blow across a kingdom. They were of inestimable value, the contents of that little vial; and, as he said so, he threw some of the perfume into the air and filled the room with piercing and invigorating delight.

“And what is this?”asked Georgiana, pointing to a small crystal globe containing a gold-colored liquid.“It is so beautiful to the eye that I could imagine it the elixir of life.”

“In one sense it is,”replied Aylmer;“or, rather, the elixir of immortality. It is the most precious poison that ever was concocted in this world. By its aid I could apportion the lifetime of any mortal at whom you might point your finger. The strength of the dose would determine whether he were to linger out years, or drop dead in the midst of a breath. No king on his guarded throne could keep his life if I, in my private station, should deem that the welfare of millions justified me in depriving him of it.”

“Why do you keep such a terrific drug?”inquired Georgiana in horror.

“Do not mistrust me, dearest,”said her husband, smiling;“its virtuous potency is yet greater than its harmful one. But see! here is a powerful cosmetic. With a few drops of this in a vase of water, freckles may be washed away as easily as the hands are cleansed. A stronger infusion would take the blood out of the cheek, and leave the rosiest beauty a pale ghost.”

“Is it with this lotion that you intend to bathe my cheek?”asked Georgiana, anxiously.

“Oh, no,”hastily replied her husband;“this is merely superficial. Your case demands a remedy that shall go deeper.”

In his interviews with Georgiana, Aylmer generally made minute inquiries as to her sensations and whether the confinement of the rooms and the temperature of the atmosphere agreed with her. These questions had such a particular drift that Georgiana began to conjecture that she was already subjected to certain physical influences, either breathed in with the fragrant air or taken with her food. She fancied likewise, but it might be altogether fancy, that there was a stirring up of her system—a strange, indefinite sensation creeping through her veins, and tingling, half painfully, half pleasurably, at her heart. Still, whenever she dared to look into the mirror, there she beheld herself pale as a white rose and with the crimson birthmark stamped upon her cheek. Not even Aylmer now hated it so much as she.

To dispel the tedium of the hours which her husband found it necessary to devote to the processes of combination and analysis, Georgiana turned over the volumes of his scientific library. In many dark old tomes she met with chapters full of romance and poetry. They were the works of the philosophers of the middle ages, such as Albertus Magnus, Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and the famous friar who created the prophetic Brazen Head. All these antique naturalists stood in advance of their centuries, yet were imbued with some of their credulity, and therefore were believed, and perhaps imagined themselves to have acquired from the investigation of Nature a power above Nature, and from physics a sway over the spiritual world. Hardly less curious and imaginative were the early volumes of the Transactions of the Royal Society, in which the members, knowing little of the limits of natural possibility, were continually recording wonders or proposing methods whereby wonders might be wrought.

But to Georgiana the most engrossing volume was a large folio from her husband's own hand, in which he had recorded every experiment of his scientific career, its original aim, the methods adopted for its development, and its final success or failure, with the circumstances to which either event was attributable. The book, in truth, was both the history and emblem of his ardent, ambitious, imaginative, yet practical and laborious life. He handled physical details as if there were nothing beyond them; yet spiritualized them all, and redeemed himself from materialism by his strong and eager aspiration towards the infinite. In his grasp the veriest clod of earth assumed a soul. Georgiana, as she read, reverenced Aylmer and loved him more profoundly than ever, but with a less entire dependence on his judgment than heretofore. Much as he had accomplished, she could not but observe that his most splendid successes were almost invariably failures, if compared with the ideal at which he aimed. His brightest diamonds were the merest pebbles, and felt to be so by himself, in comparison with the inestimable gems which lay hidden beyond his reach. The volume, rich with achievements that had won renown for its author, was yet as melancholy a record as ever mortal hand had penned. It was the sad confession and continual exemplification of the shortcomings of the composite man, the spirit burdened with clay and working in matter, and of the despair that assails the higher nature at finding itself so miserably thwarted by the earthly part. Perhaps every man of genius in whatever sphere might recognize the image of his own experience in Aylmer's journal.

So deeply did these reflections affect Georgiana that she laid her face upon the open volume and burst into tears. In this situation she was found by her husband.

“It is dangerous to read in a sorcerer's books,”said he, with a smile, though his countenance was uneasy and displeased.“Georgiana, there are pages in that volume which I can scarcely glance over and keep my senses. Take heed lest it prove as detrimental to you.”

“It has made me worship you more than ever,”said she.

“Ah, wait for this one success,”rejoined he,“then worship me if you will. I shall deem myself hardly unworthy of it. But come, I have sought you for the luxury of your voice. Sing to me, dearest.”

So she poured out the liquid music of her voice to quench the thirst of his spirit. He then took his leave with a boyish exuberance of gayety, assuring her that her seclusion would endure but a little longer, and that the result was already certain. Scarcely had he departed when Georgiana felt irresistibly impelled to follow him. She had forgotten to inform Aylmer of a symptom which for two or three hours past had begun to excite her attention. It was a sensation in the fatal birthmark, not painful, but which induced a restlessness throughout her system. Hastening after her husband, she intruded for the first time into the laboratory. The first thing that struck her eye was the furnace, that hot and feverish worker, with the intense glow of its fire, which by the quantities of soot clustered above it seemed to have been burning for ages. There was a distilling apparatus in full operation. Around the room were retorts, tubes, cylinders, crucibles, and other apparatus of chemical research. An electrical machine stood ready for immediate use. The atmosphere felt oppressively close, and was tainted with gaseous odors which had been tormented forth by the processes of science. The severe and homely simplicity of the apartment, with its naked walls and brick pavement, looked strange, accustomed as Georgiana had become to the fantastic elegance of her boudoir. But what chiefly, indeed almost solely, drew her attention, was the aspect of Aylmer himself.

He was pale as death, anxious and absorbed, and hung over the furnace as if it depended upon his utmost watchfulness whether the liquid which it was distilling should be the draught of immortal happiness or misery. How different from the sanguine and joyous mien that he had assumed for Georgiana's encouragement!

“Carefully now, Aminadab; carefully, thou human machine; carefully, thou man of clay!”muttered Aylmer, more to himself than his assistant.“Now, if there be a thought too much or too little, it is all over.”

“Ho! ho!”mumbled Aminadab.“Look, master! look!”

Aylmer raised his eyes hastily, and at first reddened, then grew paler than ever, on beholding Georgiana. He rushed towards her and seized her arm with a gripe that left the print of his fingers upon it.

“Why do you come hither? Have you no trust in your husband?”cried he, impetuously.“Would you throw the blight of that fatal birthmark over my labors? It is not well done. Go, prying woman, go!”

“Nay, Aylmer,”said Georgiana with the firmness of which she possessed no stinted endowment,“it is not you that have a right to complain. You mistrust your wife; you have concealed the anxiety with which you watch the development of this experiment. Think not so unworthily of me, my husband. Tell me all the risk we run, and fear not that I shall shrink; for my share in it is far less than your own.”

“No, no, Georgiana!”said Aylmer, impatiently;“it must not be.”

“I submit,”replied she calmly.“And, Aylmer, I shall quaff whatever draught you bring me; but it will be on the same principle that would induce me to take a dose of poison if offered by your hand.”

“My noble wife,”said Aylmer, deeply moved,“I knew not the height and depth of your nature until now. Nothing shall be concealed. Know, then, that this crimson hand, superficial as it seems, has clutched its grasp into your being with a strength of which I had no previous conception. I have already administered agents powerful enough to do aught except to change your entire physical system. Only one thing remains to be tried. If that fail us we are ruined.”

“Why did you hesitate to tell me this?”asked she.

“Because, Georgiana,”said Aylmer, in a low voice,“there is danger.”

“Danger? There is but one danger—that this horrible stigma shall be left upon my cheek!”cried Georgiana.“Remove it, remove it, whatever be the cost, or we shall both go mad!”

“Heaven knows your words are too true,”said Aylmer, sadly.“And now, dearest, return to your boudoir. In a little while all will be tested.”

He conducted her back and took leave of her with a solemn tenderness which spoke far more than his words how much was now at stake. After his departure Georgiana became rapt in musings. She considered the character of Aylmer, and did it completer justice than at any previous moment. Her heart exulted, while it trembled, at his honorable love—so pure and lofty that it would accept nothing less than perfection nor miserably make itself contented with an earthlier nature than he had dreamed of. She felt how much more precious was such a sentiment than that meaner kind which would have borne with the imperfection for her sake, and have been guilty of treason to holy love by degrading its perfect idea to the level of the actual; and with her whole spirit she prayed that, for a single moment, she might satisfy his highest and deepest conception. Longer than one moment she well knew it could not be; for his spirit was ever on the march, ever ascending, and each instant required something that was beyond the scope of the instant before.

The sound of her husband's footsteps aroused her. He bore a crystal goblet containing a liquor colorless as water, but bright enough to be the draught of immortality. Aylmer was pale; but it seemed rather the consequence of a highly-wrought state of mind and tension of spirit than of fear or doubt.

“The concoction of the draught has been perfect,”said he, in answer to Georgiana's look.“Unless all my science have deceived me, it cannot fail.”

“Save on your account, my dearest Aylmer,”observed his wife,“I might wish to put off this birthmark of mortality by relinquishing mortality itself in preference to any other mode. Life is but a sad possession to those who have attained precisely the degree of moral advancement at which I stand. Were I weaker and blinder it might be happiness. Were I stronger, it might be endured hopefully. But, being what I find myself, methinks I am of all mortals the most fit to die.”

“You are fit for heaven without tasting death!”replied her husband.“But why do we speak of dying? The draught cannot fail. Behold its effect upon this plant.”

On the window seat there stood a geranium diseased with yellow blotches, which had overspread all its leaves. Aylmer poured a small quantity of the liquid upon the soil in which it grew. In a little time, when the roots of the plant had taken up the moisture, the unsightly blotches began to be extinguished in a living verdure.

“There needed no proof,”said Georgiana, quietly.“Give me the goblet. I joyfully stake all upon your word.”

“Drink, then, thou lofty creature!”exclaimed Aylmer, with fervid admiration.“There is no taint of imperfection on thy spirit. Thy sensible frame, too, shall soon be all perfect.”

She quaffed the liquid and returned the goblet to his hand.“It is grateful,”said she with a placid smile.“Methinks it is like water from a heavenly fountain; for it contains I know not what of unobtrusive fragrance and deliciousness. It allays a feverish thirst that had parched me for many days. Now, dearest, let me sleep. My earthly senses are closing over my spirit like the leaves around the heart of a rose at sunset.”

She spoke the last words with a gentle reluctance, as if it required almost more energy than she could command to pronounce the faint and lingering syllables. Scarcely had they loitered through her lips ere she was lost in slumber. Aylmer sat by her side, watching her aspect with the emotions proper to a man the whole value of whose existence was involved in the process now to be tested. Mingled with this mood, however, was the philosophic investigation characteristic of the man of science. Not the minutest symptom escaped him. A heightened flush of the cheek, a slight irregularity of breath, a quiver of the eyelid, a hardly perceptible tremor through the frame,—such were the details which, as the moments passed, he wrote down in his folio volume. Intense thought had set its stamp upon every previous page of that volume, but the thoughts of years were all concentrated upon the last.

While thus employed, he failed not to gaze often at the fatal hand, and not without a shudder. Yet once, by a strange and unaccountable impulse he pressed it with his lips. His spirit recoiled, however, in the very act; and Georgiana, out of the midst of her deep sleep, moved uneasily and murmured as if in remonstrance. Again Aylmer resumed his watch. Nor was it without avail. The crimson hand, which at first had been strongly visible upon the marble paleness of Georgiana's cheek, now grew more faintly outlined. She remained not less pale than ever; but the birthmark, with every breath that came and went, lost somewhat of its former distinctness. Its presence had been awful; its departure was more awful still. Watch the stain of the rainbow fading out of the sky, and you will know how that mysterious symbol passed away.

“By Heaven! it is well-nigh gone!”said Aylmer to himself, in almost irrepressible ecstasy.“I can scarcely trace it now. Success! success! And now it is like the faintest rose color. The lightest flush of blood across her cheek would overcome it. But she is so pale!”

He drew aside the window curtain and suffered the light of natural day to fall into the room and rest upon her cheek. At the same time he heard a gross, hoarse chuckle, which he had long known as his servant Aminadab's expression of delight.

“Ah, clod! ah, earthly mass!”cried Aylmer, laughing in a sort of frenzy,“you have served me well! Matter and spirit—earth and heaven—have both done their part in this! Laugh, thing of the senses! You have earned the right to laugh.”

These exclamations broke Georgiana's sleep. She slowly unclosed her eyes and gazed into the mirror which her husband had arranged for that purpose. A faint smile flitted over her lips when she recognized how barely perceptible was now that crimson hand which had once blazed forth with such disastrous brilliancy as to scare away all their happiness. But then her eyes sought Aylmer's face with a trouble and anxiety that he could by no means account for.

“My poor Aylmer!”murmured she.

“Poor? Nay, richest, happiest, most favored!”exclaimed he.“My peerless bride, it is successful! You are perfect!”

“My poor Aylmer,”she repeated, with a more than human tenderness,“you have aimed loftily; you have done nobly. Do not repent that with so high and pure a feeling, you have rejected the best the earth could offer. Aylmer, dearest Aylmer, I am dying!”

Alas! it was too true! The fatal hand had grappled with the mystery of life, and was the bond by which an angelic spirit kept itself in union with a mortal frame. As the last crimson tint of the birthmark—that sole token of human imperfection—faded from her cheek, the parting breath of the now perfect woman passed into the atmosphere, and her soul, lingering a moment near her husband, took its heavenward flight. Then a hoarse, chuckling laugh was heard again! Thus ever does the gross fatality of earth exult in its invariable triumph over the immortal essence which, in this dim sphere of half development, demands the completeness of a higher state. Yet, had Aylmer reached a profounder wisdom, he need not thus have flung away the happiness which would have woven his mortal life of the selfsame texture with the celestial. The momentary circumstance was too strong for him; he failed to look beyond the shadowy scope of time, and, living once for all in eternity, to find the perfect future in the present.





RAPPACCINI'S DAUGHTER


A young man, named Giovanni Guasconti, came, very long ago, from the more southern region of Italy, to pursue his studies at the University of Padua. Giovanni, who had but a scanty supply of gold ducats in his pocket, took lodgings in a high and gloomy chamber of an old edifice which looked not unworthy to have been the palace of a Paduan noble, and which, in fact, exhibited over its entrance the armorial bearings of a family long since extinct. The young stranger, who was not unstudied in the great poem of his country, recollected that one of the ancestors of this family, and perhaps an occupant of this very mansion, had been pictured by Dante as a partaker of the immortal agonies of his Inferno. These reminiscences and associations, together with the tendency to heartbreak natural to a young man for the first time out of his native sphere, caused Giovanni to sigh heavily as he looked around the desolate and ill-furnished apartment.

“Holy Virgin, signor!”cried old Dame Lisabetta, who, won by the youth's remarkable beauty of person, was kindly endeavoring to give the chamber a habitable air,“what a sigh was that to come out of a young man's heart! Do you find this old mansion gloomy? For the love of Heaven, then, put your head out of the window, and you will see as bright sunshine as you have left in Naples.”

Guasconti mechanically did as the old woman advised, but could not quite agree with her that the Paduan sunshine was as cheerful as that of southern Italy. Such as it was, however, it fell upon a garden beneath the window and expended its fostering influences on a variety of plants, which seemed to have been cultivated with exceeding care.

“Does this garden belong to the house?”asked Giovanni.

“Heaven forbid, signor, unless it were fruitful of better pot herbs than any that grow there now,”answered old Lisabetta.“No; that garden is cultivated by the own hands of Signor Giacomo Rappaccini, the famous doctor, who, I warrant him, has been heard of as far as Naples. It is said that he distils these plants into medicines that are as potent as a charm. Oftentimes you may see the signor doctor at work, and perchance the signora, his daughter, too, gathering the strange flowers that grow in the garden.”

The old woman had now done what she could for the aspect of the chamber; and, commending the young man to the protection of the saints, took her departure.

Giovanni still found no better occupation than to look down into the garden beneath his window. From its appearance, he judged it to be one of those botanic gardens which were of earlier date in Padua than elsewhere in Italy or in the world. Or, not improbably, it might once have been the pleasure-place of an opulent family; for there was the ruin of a marble fountain in the centre, sculptured with rare art, but so wofully shattered that it was impossible to trace the original design from the chaos of remaining fragments. The water, however, continued to gush and sparkle into the sunbeams as cheerfully as ever. A little gurgling sound ascended to the young man's window, and made him feel as if the fountain were an immortal spirit that sung its song unceasingly and without heeding the vicissitudes around it, while one century imbodied it in marble and another scattered the perishable garniture on the soil. All about the pool into which the water subsided grew various plants, that seemed to require a plentiful supply of moisture for the nourishment of gigantic leaves, and, in some instances, flowers gorgeously magnificent. There was one shrub in particular, set in a marble vase in the midst of the pool, that bore a profusion of purple blossoms, each of which had the lustre and richness of a gem; and the whole together made a show so resplendent that it seemed enough to illuminate the garden, even had there been no sunshine. Every portion of the soil was peopled with plants and herbs, which, if less beautiful, still bore tokens of assiduous care, as if all had their individual virtues, known to the scientific mind that fostered them. Some were placed in urns, rich with old carving, and others in common garden pots; some crept serpent-like along the ground or climbed on high, using whatever means of ascent was offered them. One plant had wreathed itself round a statue of Vertumnus, which was thus quite veiled and shrouded in a drapery of hanging foliage, so happily arranged that it might have served a sculptor for a study.

While Giovanni stood at the window he heard a rustling behind a screen of leaves, and became aware that a person was at work in the garden. His figure soon emerged into view, and showed itself to be that of no common laborer, but a tall, emaciated, sallow, and sickly-looking man, dressed in a scholar's garb of black. He was beyond the middle term of life, with gray hair, a thin, gray beard, and a face singularly marked with intellect and cultivation, but which could never, even in his more youthful days, have expressed much warmth of heart.

Nothing could exceed the intentness with which this scientific gardener examined every shrub which grew in his path: it seemed as if he was looking into their inmost nature, making observations in regard to their creative essence, and discovering why one leaf grew in this shape and another in that, and wherefore such and such flowers differed among themselves in hue and perfume. Nevertheless, in spite of this deep intelligence on his part, there was no approach to intimacy between himself and these vegetable existences. On the contrary, he avoided their actual touch or the direct inhaling of their odors with a caution that impressed Giovanni most disagreeably; for the man's demeanor was that of one walking among malignant influences, such as savage beasts, or deadly snakes, or evil spirits, which, should he allow them one moment of license, would wreak upon him some terrible fatality. It was strangely frightful to the young man's imagination to see this air of insecurity in a person cultivating a garden, that most simple and innocent of human toils, and which had been alike the joy and labor of the unfallen parents of the race. Was this garden, then, the Eden of the present world? And this man, with such a perception of harm in what his own hands caused to grow,—was he the Adam?

The distrustful gardener, while plucking away the dead leaves or pruning the too luxuriant growth of the shrubs, defended his hands with a pair of thick gloves. Nor were these his only armor. When, in his walk through the garden, he came to the magnificent plant that hung its purple gems beside the marble fountain, he placed a kind of mask over his mouth and nostrils, as if all this beauty did but conceal a deadlier malice; but, finding his task still too dangerous, he drew back, removed the mask, and called loudly, but in the infirm voice of a person affected with inward disease,—

“Beatrice! Beatrice!”

“Here am I, my father. What would you?”cried a rich and youthful voice from the window of the opposite house—a voice as rich as a tropical sunset, and which made Giovanni, though he knew not why, think of deep hues of purple or crimson and of perfumes heavily delectable.“Are you in the garden?”

“Yes, Beatrice,”answered the gardener,“and I need your help.”

Soon there emerged from under a sculptured portal the figure of a young girl, arrayed with as much richness of taste as the most splendid of the flowers, beautiful as the day, and with a bloom so deep and vivid that one shade more would have been too much. She looked redundant with life, health, and energy; all of which attributes were bound down and compressed, as it were, and girdled tensely, in their luxuriance, by her virgin zone. Yet Giovanni's fancy must have grown morbid while he looked down into the garden; for the impression which the fair stranger made upon him was as if here were another flower, the human sister of those vegetable ones, as beautiful as they, more beautiful than the richest of them, but still to be touched only with a glove, nor to be approached without a mask. As Beatrice came down the garden path, it was observable that she handled and inhaled the odor of several of the plants which her father had most sedulously avoided.

“Here, Beatrice,”said the latter,“see how many needful offices require to be done to our chief treasure. Yet, shattered as I am, my life might pay the penalty of approaching it so closely as circumstances demand. Henceforth, I fear, this plant must be consigned to your sole charge.”

“And gladly will I undertake it,”cried again the rich tones of the young lady, as she bent towards the magnificent plant and opened her arms as if to embrace it.“Yes, my sister, my splendor, it shall be Beatrice's task to nurse and serve thee; and thou shalt reward her with thy kisses and perfumed breath, which to her is as the breath of life.”

Then, with all the tenderness in her manner that was so strikingly expressed in her words, she busied herself with such attentions as the plant seemed to require; and Giovanni, at his lofty window, rubbed his eyes and almost doubted whether it were a girl tending her favorite flower, or one sister performing the duties of affection to another. The scene soon terminated. Whether Dr. Rappaccini had finished his labors in the garden, or that his watchful eye had caught the stranger's face, he now took his daughter's arm and retired. Night was already closing in; oppressive exhalations seemed to proceed from the plants and steal upward past the open window; and Giovanni, closing the lattice, went to his couch and dreamed of a rich flower and beautiful girl. Flower and maiden were different, and yet the same, and fraught with some strange peril in either shape.

But there is an influence in the light of morning that tends to rectify whatever errors of fancy, or even of judgment, we may have incurred during the sun's decline, or among the shadows of the night, or in the less wholesome glow of moonshine. Giovanni's first movement, on starting from sleep, was to throw open the window and gaze down into the garden which his dreams had made so fertile of mysteries. He was surprised and a little ashamed to find how real and matter-of-fact an affair it proved to be, in the first rays of the sun which gilded the dew-drops that hung upon leaf and blossom, and, while giving a brighter beauty to each rare flower, brought everything within the limits of ordinary experience. The young man rejoiced that, in the heart of the barren city, he had the privilege of overlooking this spot of lovely and luxuriant vegetation. It would serve, he said to himself, as a symbolic language to keep him in communion with Nature. Neither the sickly and thoughtworn Dr. Giacomo Rappaccini, it is true, nor his brilliant daughter, were now visible; so that Giovanni could not determine how much of the singularity which he attributed to both was due to their own qualities and how much to his wonder-working fancy; but he was inclined to take a most rational view of the whole matter.

In the course of the day he paid his respects to Signor Pietro Baglioni, professor of medicine in the university, a physician of eminent repute to whom Giovanni had brought a letter of introduction. The professor was an elderly personage, apparently of genial nature, and habits that might almost be called jovial. He kept the young man to dinner, and made himself very agreeable by the freedom and liveliness of his conversation, especially when warmed by a flask or two of Tuscan wine. Giovanni, conceiving that men of science, inhabitants of the same city, must needs be on familiar terms with one another, took an opportunity to mention the name of Dr. Rappaccini. But the professor did not respond with so much cordiality as he had anticipated.

“I'll would it become a teacher of the divine art of medicine,”said Professor Pietro Baglioni, in answer to a question of Giovanni,“to withhold due and well-considered praise of a physician so eminently skilled as Rappaccini; but, on the other hand, I should answer it but scantily to my conscience were I to permit a worthy youth like yourself, Signor Giovanni, the son of an ancient friend, to imbibe erroneous ideas respecting a man who might hereafter chance to hold your life and death in his hands. The truth is, our worshipful Dr. Rappaccini has as much science as any member of the faculty— with perhaps one single exception—in Padua, or all Italy; but there are certain grave objections to his professional character.”

“And what are they?”asked the young man.

“Has my friend Giovanni any disease of body or heart, that he is so inquisitive about physicians?”said the professor, with a smile.“But as for Rappaccini, it is said of him—and I, who know the man well, can answer for its truth—that he cares infinitely more for science than for mankind. His patients are interesting to him only as subjects for some new experiment. He would sacrifice human life, his own among the rest, or whatever else was dearest to him, for the sake of adding so much as a grain of mustard seed to the great heap of his accumulated knowledge.”

“Methinks he is an awful man indeed,”remarked Guasconti, mentally recalling the cold and purely intellectual aspect of Rappaccini.“And yet, worshipful professor, is it not a noble spirit? Are there many men capable of so spiritual a love of science?”

“God forbid,”answered the professor, somewhat testily;“at least, unless they take sounder views of the healing art than those adopted by Rappaccini. It is his theory that all medicinal virtues are comprised within those substances which we term vegetable poisons. These he cultivates with his own hands, and is said even to have produced new varieties of poison, more horribly deleterious than Nature, without the assistance of this learned person, would ever have plagued the world withal. That the signor doctor does less mischief than might be expected with such dangerous substances is undeniable. Now and then, it must be owned, he has effected, or seemed to effect, a marvellous cure; but, to tell you my private mind, Signor Giovanni, he should receive little credit for such instances of success,—they being probably the work of chance,—but should be held strictly accountable for his failures, which may justly be considered his own work.”

The youth might have taken Baglioni's opinions with many grains of allowance had he known that there was a professional warfare of long continuance between him and Dr. Rappaccini, in which the latter was generally thought to have gained the advantage. If the reader be inclined to judge for himself, we refer him to certain black-letter tracts on both sides, preserved in the medical department of the University of Padua.

“I know not, most learned professor,”returned Giovanni, after musing on what had been said of Rappaccini's exclusive zeal for science,—“I know not how dearly this physician may love his art; but surely there is one object more dear to him. He has a daughter.”

“Aha!”cried the professor, with a laugh.“So now our friend Giovanni's secret is out. You have heard of this daughter, whom all the young men in Padua are wild about, though not half a dozen have ever had the good hap to see her face. I know little of the Signora Beatrice save that Rappaccini is said to have instructed her deeply in his science, and that, young and beautiful as fame reports her, she is already qualified to fill a professor's chair. Perchance her father destines her for mine! Other absurd rumors there be, not worth talking about or listening to. So now, Signor Giovanni, drink off your glass of lachryma.”

Guasconti returned to his lodgings somewhat heated with the wine he had quaffed, and which caused his brain to swim with strange fantasies in reference to Dr. Rappaccini and the beautiful Beatrice. On his way, happening to pass by a florist's, he bought a fresh bouquet of flowers.

Ascending to his chamber, he seated himself near the window, but within the shadow thrown by the depth of the wall, so that he could look down into the garden with little risk of being discovered. All beneath his eye was a solitude. The strange plants were basking in the sunshine, and now and then nodding gently to one another, as if in acknowledgment of sympathy and kindred. In the midst, by the shattered fountain, grew the magnificent shrub, with its purple gems clustering all over it; they glowed in the air, and gleamed back again out of the depths of the pool, which thus seemed to overflow with colored radiance from the rich reflection that was steeped in it. At first, as we have said, the garden was a solitude. Soon, however,—as Giovanni had half hoped, half feared, would be the case,—a figure appeared beneath the antique sculptured portal, and came down between the rows of plants, inhaling their various perfumes as if she were one of those beings of old classic fable that lived upon sweet odors. On again beholding Beatrice, the young man was even startled to perceive how much her beauty exceeded his recollection of it; so brilliant, so vivid, was its character, that she glowed amid the sunlight, and, as Giovanni whispered to himself, positively illuminated the more shadowy intervals of the garden path. Her face being now more revealed than on the former occasion, he was struck by its expression of simplicity and sweetness,—qualities that had not entered into his idea of her character, and which made him ask anew what manner of mortal she might be. Nor did he fail again to observe, or imagine, an analogy between the beautiful girl and the gorgeous shrub that hung its gemlike flowers over the fountain,—a resemblance which Beatrice seemed to have indulged a fantastic humor in heightening, both by the arrangement of her dress and the selection of its hues.

Approaching the shrub, she threw open her arms, as with a passionate ardor, and drew its branches into an intimate embrace— so intimate that her features were hidden in its leafy bosom and her glistening ringlets all intermingled with the flowers.

“Give me thy breath, my sister,”exclaimed Beatrice;“for I am faint with common air. And give me this flower of thine, which I separate with gentlest fingers from the stem and place it close beside my heart.”

With these words the beautiful daughter of Rappaccini plucked one of the richest blossoms of the shrub, and was about to fasten it in her bosom. But now, unless Giovanni's draughts of wine had bewildered his senses, a singular incident occurred. A small orange-colored reptile, of the lizard or chameleon species, chanced to be creeping along the path, just at the feet of Beatrice. It appeared to Giovanni,—but, at the distance from which he gazed, he could scarcely have seen anything so minute,—it appeared to him, however, that a drop or two of moisture from the broken stem of the flower descended upon the lizard's head. For an instant the reptile contorted itself violently, and then lay motionless in the sunshine. Beatrice observed this remarkable phenomenon and crossed herself, sadly, but without surprise; nor did she therefore hesitate to arrange the fatal flower in her bosom. There it blushed, and almost glimmered with the dazzling effect of a precious stone, adding to her dress and aspect the one appropriate charm which nothing else in the world could have supplied. But Giovanni, out of the shadow of his window, bent forward and shrank back, and murmured and trembled.

“Am I awake? Have I my senses?”said he to himself.“What is this being? Beautiful shall I call her, or inexpressibly terrible?”

Beatrice now strayed carelessly through the garden, approaching closer beneath Giovanni's window, so that he was compelled to thrust his head quite out of its concealment in order to gratify the intense and painful curiosity which she excited. At this moment there came a beautiful insect over the garden wall; it had, perhaps, wandered through the city, and found no flowers or verdure among those antique haunts of men until the heavy perfumes of Dr. Rappaccini's shrubs had lured it from afar. Without alighting on the flowers, this winged brightness seemed to be attracted by Beatrice, and lingered in the air and fluttered about her head. Now, here it could not be but that Giovanni Guasconti's eyes deceived him. Be that as it might, he fancied that, while Beatrice was gazing at the insect with childish delight, it grew faint and fell at her feet; its bright wings shivered; it was dead—from no cause that he could discern, unless it were the atmosphere of her breath. Again Beatrice crossed herself and sighed heavily as she bent over the dead insect.

An impulsive movement of Giovanni drew her eyes to the window. There she beheld the beautiful head of the young man— rather a Grecian than an Italian head, with fair, regular features, and a glistening of gold among his ringlets—gazing down upon her like a being that hovered in mid air. Scarcely knowing what he did, Giovanni threw down the bouquet which he had hitherto held in his hand.

“Signora,”said he,“there are pure and healthful flowers. Wear them for the sake of Giovanni Guasconti.”

“Thanks, signor,”replied Beatrice, with her rich voice, that came forth as it were like a gush of music, and with a mirthful expression half childish and half woman-like.“I accept your gift, and would fain recompense it with this precious purple flower; but if I toss it into the air it will not reach you. So Signor Guasconti must even content himself with my thanks.”

She lifted the bouquet from the ground, and then, as if inwardly ashamed at having stepped aside from her maidenly reserve to respond to a stranger's greeting, passed swiftly homeward through the garden. But few as the moments were, it seemed to Giovanni, when she was on the point of vanishing beneath the sculptured portal, that his beautiful bouquet was already beginning to wither in her grasp. It was an idle thought; there could be no possibility of distinguishing a faded flower from a fresh one at so great a distance.

For many days after this incident the young man avoided the window that looked into Dr. Rappaccini's garden, as if something ugly and monstrous would have blasted his eyesight had he been betrayed into a glance. He felt conscious of having put himself, to a certain extent, within the influence of an unintelligible power by the communication which he had opened with Beatrice. The wisest course would have been, if his heart were in any real danger, to quit his lodgings and Padua itself at once; the next wiser, to have accustomed himself, as far as possible, to the familiar and daylight view of Beatrice—thus bringing her rigidly and systematically within the limits of ordinary experience. Least of all, while avoiding her sight, ought Giovanni to have remained so near this extraordinary being that the proximity and possibility even of intercourse should give a kind of substance and reality to the wild vagaries which his imagination ran riot continually in producing. Guasconti had not a deep heart—or, at all events, its depths were not sounded now; but he had a quick fancy, and an ardent southern temperament, which rose every instant to a higher fever pitch. Whether or no Beatrice possessed those terrible attributes, that fatal breath, the affinity with those so beautiful and deadly flowers which were indicated by what Giovanni had witnessed, she had at least instilled a fierce and subtle poison into his system. It was not love, although her rich beauty was a madness to him; nor horror, even while he fancied her spirit to be imbued with the same baneful essence that seemed to pervade her physical frame; but a wild offspring of both love and horror that had each parent in it, and burned like one and shivered like the other. Giovanni knew not what to dread; still less did he know what to hope; yet hope and dread kept a continual warfare in his breast, alternately vanquishing one another and starting up afresh to renew the contest. Blessed are all simple emotions, be they dark or bright! It is the lurid intermixture of the two that produces the illuminating blaze of the infernal regions.

Sometimes he endeavored to assuage the fever of his spirit by a rapid walk through the streets of Padua or beyond its gates: his footsteps kept time with the throbbings of his brain, so that the walk was apt to accelerate itself to a race. One day he found himself arrested; his arm was seized by a portly personage, who had turned back on recognizing the young man and expended much breath in overtaking him.

“Signor Giovanni! Stay, my young friend!”cried he.“Have you forgotten me? That might well be the case if I were as much altered as yourself.”

It was Baglioni, whom Giovanni had avoided ever since their first meeting, from a doubt that the professor's sagacity would look too deeply into his secrets. Endeavoring to recover himself, he stared forth wildly from his inner world into the outer one and spoke like a man in a dream.

“Yes; I am Giovanni Guasconti. You are Professor Pietro Baglioni. Now let me pass!”

“Not yet, not yet, Signor Giovanni Guasconti,”said the professor, smiling, but at the same time scrutinizing the youth with an earnest glance.“What! did I grow up side by side with your father? and shall his son pass me like a stranger in these old streets of Padua? Stand still, Signor Giovanni; for we must have a word or two before we part.”

“Speedily, then, most worshipful professor, speedily,”said Giovanni, with feverish impatience.“Does not your worship see that I am in haste?”

Now, while he was speaking there came a man in black along the street, stooping and moving feebly like a person in inferior health. His face was all overspread with a most sickly and sallow hue, but yet so pervaded with an expression of piercing and active intellect that an observer might easily have overlooked the merely physical attributes and have seen only this wonderful energy. As he passed, this person exchanged a cold and distant salutation with Baglioni, but fixed his eyes upon Giovanni with an intentness that seemed to bring out whatever was within him worthy of notice. Nevertheless, there was a peculiar quietness in the look, as if taking merely a speculative, not a human interest, in the young man.

“It is Dr. Rappaccini!”whispered the professor when the stranger had passed.“Has he ever seen your face before?”

“Not that I know,”answered Giovanni, starting at the name.

“He HAS seen you! he must have seen you!”said Baglioni, hastily.“For some purpose or other, this man of science is making a study of you. I know that look of his! It is the same that coldly illuminates his face as he bends over a bird, a mouse, or a butterfly, which, in pursuance of some experiment, he has killed by the perfume of a flower; a look as deep as Nature itself, but without Nature's warmth of love. Signor Giovanni, I will stake my life upon it, you are the subject of one of Rappaccini's experiments!”

“Will you make a fool of me?”cried Giovanni, passionately.“THAT, signor professor, were an untoward experiment.”

“Patience! patience!”replied the imperturbable professor.“I tell thee, my poor Giovanni, that Rappaccini has a scientific interest in thee. Thou hast fallen into fearful hands! And the Signora Beatrice,—what part does she act in this mystery?”

But Guasconti, finding Baglioni's pertinacity intolerable, here broke away, and was gone before the professor could again seize his arm. He looked after the young man intently and shook his head.

“This must not be,”said Baglioni to himself.“The youth is the son of my old friend, and shall not come to any harm from which the arcana of medical science can preserve him. Besides, it is too insufferable an impertinence in Rappaccini, thus to snatch the lad out of my own hands, as I may say, and make use of him for his infernal experiments. This daughter of his! It shall be looked to. Perchance, most learned Rappaccini, I may foil you where you little dream of it!”

Meanwhile Giovanni had pursued a circuitous route, and at length found himself at the door of his lodgings. As he crossed the threshold he was met by old Lisabetta, who smirked and smiled, and was evidently desirous to attract his attention; vainly, however, as the ebullition of his feelings had momentarily subsided into a cold and dull vacuity. He turned his eyes full upon the withered face that was puckering itself into a smile, but seemed to behold it not. The old dame, therefore, laid her grasp upon his cloak.

“Signor! signor!”whispered she, still with a smile over the whole breadth of her visage, so that it looked not unlike a grotesque carving in wood, darkened by centuries.“Listen, signor! There is a private entrance into the garden!”

“What do you say?”exclaimed Giovanni, turning quickly about, as if an inanimate thing should start into feverish life.“A private entrance into Dr. Rappaccini's garden?”

“Hush! hush! not so loud!”whispered Lisabetta, putting her hand over his mouth.“Yes; into the worshipful doctor's garden, where you may see all his fine shrubbery. Many a young man in Padua would give gold to be admitted among those flowers.”

Giovanni put a piece of gold into her hand.

“Show me the way,”said he.

A surmise, probably excited by his conversation with Baglioni, crossed his mind, that this interposition of old Lisabetta might perchance be connected with the intrigue, whatever were its nature, in which the professor seemed to suppose that Dr. Rappaccini was involving him. But such a suspicion, though it disturbed Giovanni, was inadequate to restrain him. The instant that he was aware of the possibility of approaching Beatrice, it seemed an absolute necessity of his existence to do so. It mattered not whether she were angel or demon; he was irrevocably within her sphere, and must obey the law that whirled him onward, in ever-lessening circles, towards a result which he did not attempt to foreshadow; and yet, strange to say, there came across him a sudden doubt whether this intense interest on his part were not delusory; whether it were really of so deep and positive a nature as to justify him in now thrusting himself into an incalculable position; whether it were not merely the fantasy of a young man's brain, only slightly or not at all connected with his heart.

He paused, hesitated, turned half about, but again went on. His withered guide led him along several obscure passages, and finally undid a door, through which, as it was opened, there came the sight and sound of rustling leaves, with the broken sunshine glimmering among them. Giovanni stepped forth, and, forcing himself through the entanglement of a shrub that wreathed its tendrils over the hidden entrance, stood beneath his own window in the open area of Dr. Rappaccini's garden.

How often is it the case that, when impossibilities have come to pass and dreams have condensed their misty substance into tangible realities, we find ourselves calm, and even coldly self-possessed, amid circumstances which it would have been a delirium of joy or agony to anticipate! Fate delights to thwart us thus. Passion will choose his own time to rush upon the scene, and lingers sluggishly behind when an appropriate adjustment of events would seem to summon his appearance. So was it now with Giovanni. Day after day his pulses had throbbed with feverish blood at the improbable idea of an interview with Beatrice, and of standing with her, face to face, in this very garden, basking in the Oriental sunshine of her beauty, and snatching from her full gaze the mystery which he deemed the riddle of his own existence. But now there was a singular and untimely equanimity within his breast. He threw a glance around the garden to discover if Beatrice or her father were present, and, perceiving that he was alone, began a critical observation of the plants.

The aspect of one and all of them dissatisfied him; their gorgeousness seemed fierce, passionate, and even unnatural. There was hardly an individual shrub which a wanderer, straying by himself through a forest, would not have been startled to find growing wild, as if an unearthly face had glared at him out of the thicket. Several also would have shocked a delicate instinct by an appearance of artificialness indicating that there had been such commixture, and, as it were, adultery, of various vegetable species, that the production was no longer of God's making, but the monstrous offspring of man's depraved fancy, glowing with only an evil mockery of beauty. They were probably the result of experiment, which in one or two cases had succeeded in mingling plants individually lovely into a compound possessing the questionable and ominous character that distinguished the whole growth of the garden. In fine, Giovanni recognized but two or three plants in the collection, and those of a kind that he well knew to be poisonous. While busy with these contemplations he heard the rustling of a silken garment, and, turning, beheld Beatrice emerging from beneath the sculptured portal.

Giovanni had not considered with himself what should be his deportment; whether he should apologize for his intrusion into the garden, or assume that he was there with the privity at least, if not by the desire, of Dr. Rappaccini or his daughter; but Beatrice's manner placed him at his ease, though leaving him still in doubt by what agency he had gained admittance. She came lightly along the path and met him near the broken fountain. There was surprise in her face, but brightened by a simple and kind expression of pleasure.

“You are a connoisseur in flowers, signor,”said Beatrice, with a smile, alluding to the bouquet which he had flung her from the window.“It is no marvel, therefore, if the sight of my father's rare collection has tempted you to take a nearer view. If he were here, he could tell you many strange and interesting facts as to the nature and habits of these shrubs; for he has spent a lifetime in such studies, and this garden is his world.”

“And yourself, lady,”observed Giovanni,“if fame says true,— you likewise are deeply skilled in the virtues indicated by these rich blossoms and these spicy perfumes. Would you deign to be my instructress, I should prove an apter scholar than if taught by Signor Rappaccini himself.”

“Are there such idle rumors?”asked Beatrice, with the music of a pleasant laugh.“Do people say that I am skilled in my father's science of plants? What a jest is there! No; though I have grown up among these flowers, I know no more of them than their hues and perfume; and sometimes methinks I would fain rid myself of even that small knowledge. There are many flowers here, and those not the least brilliant, that shock and offend me when they meet my eye. But pray, signor, do not believe these stories about my science. Believe nothing of me save what you see with your own eyes.”

“And must I believe all that I have seen with my own eyes?”asked Giovanni, pointedly, while the recollection of former scenes made him shrink.“No, signora; you demand too little of me. Bid me believe nothing save what comes from your own lips.”

It would appear that Beatrice understood him. There came a deep flush to her cheek; but she looked full into Giovanni's eyes, and responded to his gaze of uneasy suspicion with a queenlike haughtiness.

“I do so bid you, signor,”she replied.“Forget whatever you may have fancied in regard to me. If true to the outward senses, still it may be false in its essence; but the words of Beatrice Rappaccini's lips are true from the depths of the heart outward. Those you may believe.”

A fervor glowed in her whole aspect and beamed upon Giovanni's consciousness like the light of truth itself; but while she spoke there was a fragrance in the atmosphere around her, rich and delightful, though evanescent, yet which the young man, from an indefinable reluctance, scarcely dared to draw into his lungs. It might be the odor of the flowers. Could it be Beatrice's breath which thus embalmed her words with a strange richness, as if by steeping them in her heart? A faintness passed like a shadow over Giovanni and flitted away; he seemed to gaze through the beautiful girl's eyes into her transparent soul, and felt no more doubt or fear.

The tinge of passion that had colored Beatrice's manner vanished; she became gay, and appeared to derive a pure delight from her communion with the youth not unlike what the maiden of a lonely island might have felt conversing with a voyager from the civilized world. Evidently her experience of life had been confined within the limits of that garden. She talked now about matters as simple as the daylight or summer clouds, and now asked questions in reference to the city, or Giovanni's distant home, his friends, his mother, and his sisters—questions indicating such seclusion, and such lack of familiarity with modes and forms, that Giovanni responded as if to an infant. Her spirit gushed out before him like a fresh rill that was just catching its first glimpse of the sunlight and wondering at the reflections of earth and sky which were flung into its bosom. There came thoughts, too, from a deep source, and fantasies of a gemlike brilliancy, as if diamonds and rubies sparkled upward among the bubbles of the fountain. Ever and anon there gleamed across the young man's mind a sense of wonder that he should be walking side by side with the being who had so wrought upon his imagination, whom he had idealized in such hues of terror, in whom he had positively witnessed such manifestations of dreadful attributes,—that he should be conversing with Beatrice like a brother, and should find her so human and so maidenlike. But such reflections were only momentary; the effect of her character was too real not to make itself familiar at once.

In this free intercourse they had strayed through the garden, and now, after many turns among its avenues, were come to the shattered fountain, beside which grew the magnificent shrub, with its treasury of glowing blossoms. A fragrance was diffused from it which Giovanni recognized as identical with that which he had attributed to Beatrice's breath, but incomparably more powerful. As her eyes fell upon it, Giovanni beheld her press her hand to her bosom as if her heart were throbbing suddenly and painfully.

“For the first time in my life,”murmured she, addressing the shrub,“I had forgotten thee.”

“I remember, signora,”said Giovanni,“that you once promised to reward me with one of these living gems for the bouquet which I had the happy boldness to fling to your feet. Permit me now to pluck it as a memorial of this interview.”

He made a step towards the shrub with extended hand; but Beatrice darted forward, uttering a shriek that went through his heart like a dagger. She caught his hand and drew it back with the whole force of her slender figure. Giovanni felt her touch thrilling through his fibres.

“Touch it not!”exclaimed she, in a voice of agony.“Not for thy life! It is fatal!”

Then, hiding her face, she fled from him and vanished beneath the sculptured portal. As Giovanni followed her with his eyes, he beheld the emaciated figure and pale intelligence of Dr. Rappaccini, who had been watching the scene, he knew not how long, within the shadow of the entrance.

No sooner was Guasconti alone in his chamber than the image of Beatrice came back to his passionate musings, invested with all the witchery that had been gathering around it ever since his first glimpse of her, and now likewise imbued with a tender warmth of girlish womanhood. She was human; her nature was endowed with all gentle and feminine qualities; she was worthiest to be worshipped; she was capable, surely, on her part, of the height and heroism of love. Those tokens which he had hitherto considered as proofs of a frightful peculiarity in her physical and moral system were now either forgotten, or, by the subtle sophistry of passion transmitted into a golden crown of enchantment, rendering Beatrice the more admirable by so much as she was the more unique. Whatever had looked ugly was now beautiful; or, if incapable of such a change, it stole away and hid itself among those shapeless half ideas which throng the dim region beyond the daylight of our perfect consciousness. Thus did he spend the night, nor fell asleep until the dawn had begun to awake the slumbering flowers in Dr. Rappaccini's garden, whither Giovanni's dreams doubtless led him. Up rose the sun in his due season, and, flinging his beams upon the young man's eyelids, awoke him to a sense of pain. When thoroughly aroused, he became sensible of a burning and tingling agony in his hand—in his right hand—the very hand which Beatrice had grasped in her own when he was on the point of plucking one of the gemlike flowers. On the back of that hand there was now a purple print like that of four small fingers, and the likeness of a slender thumb upon his wrist.

Oh, how stubbornly does love,—or even that cunning semblance of love which flourishes in the imagination, but strikes no depth of root into the heart,—how stubbornly does it hold its faith until the moment comes when it is doomed to vanish into thin mist! Giovanni wrapped a handkerchief about his hand and wondered what evil thing had stung him, and soon forgot his pain in a reverie of Beatrice.

After the first interview, a second was in the inevitable course of what we call fate. A third; a fourth; and a meeting with Beatrice in the garden was no longer an incident in Giovanni's daily life, but the whole space in which he might be said to live; for the anticipation and memory of that ecstatic hour made up the remainder. Nor was it otherwise with the daughter of Rappaccini. She watched for the youth's appearance, and flew to his side with confidence as unreserved as if they had been playmates from early infancy—as if they were such playmates still. If, by any unwonted chance, he failed to come at the appointed moment, she stood beneath the window and sent up the rich sweetness of her tones to float around him in his chamber and echo and reverberate throughout his heart:“Giovanni! Giovanni! Why tarriest thou? Come down!”And down he hastened into that Eden of poisonous flowers.

But, with all this intimate familiarity, there was still a reserve in Beatrice's demeanor, so rigidly and invariably sustained that the idea of infringing it scarcely occurred to his imagination. By all appreciable signs, they loved; they had looked love with eyes that conveyed the holy secret from the depths of one soul into the depths of the other, as if it were too sacred to be whispered by the way; they had even spoken love in those gushes of passion when their spirits darted forth in articulated breath like tongues of long-hidden flame; and yet there had been no seal of lips, no clasp of hands, nor any slightest caress such as love claims and hallows. He had never touched one of the gleaming ringlets of her hair; her garment—so marked was the physical barrier between them—had never been waved against him by a breeze. On the few occasions when Giovanni had seemed tempted to overstep the limit, Beatrice grew so sad, so stern, and withal wore such a look of desolate separation, shuddering at itself, that not a spoken word was requisite to repel him. At such times he was startled at the horrible suspicions that rose, monster-like, out of the caverns of his heart and stared him in the face; his love grew thin and faint as the morning mist, his doubts alone had substance. But, when Beatrice's face brightened again after the momentary shadow, she was transformed at once from the mysterious, questionable being whom he had watched with so much awe and horror; she was now the beautiful and unsophisticated girl whom he felt that his spirit knew with a certainty beyond all other knowledge.

A considerable time had now passed since Giovanni's last meeting with Baglioni. One morning, however, he was disagreeably surprised by a visit from the professor, whom he had scarcely thought of for whole weeks, and would willingly have forgotten still longer. Given up as he had long been to a pervading excitement, he could tolerate no companions except upon condition of their perfect sympathy with his present state of feeling. Such sympathy was not to be expected from Professor Baglioni.

The visitor chatted carelessly for a few moments about the gossip of the city and the university, and then took up another topic.

“I have been reading an old classic author lately,”said he,“and met with a story that strangely interested me. Possibly you may remember it. It is of an Indian prince, who sent a beautiful woman as a present to Alexander the Great. She was as lovely as the dawn and gorgeous as the sunset; but what especially distinguished her was a certain rich perfume in her breath—richer than a garden of Persian roses. Alexander, as was natural to a youthful conqueror, fell in love at first sight with this magnificent stranger; but a certain sage physician, happening to be present, discovered a terrible secret in regard to her.”

“And what was that?”asked Giovanni, turning his eyes downward to avoid those of the professor.

“That this lovely woman,”continued Baglioni, with emphasis,“had been nourished with poisons from her birth upward, until her whole nature was so imbued with them that she herself had become the deadliest poison in existence. Poison was her element of life. With that rich perfume of her breath she blasted the very air. Her love would have been poison—her embrace death. Is not this a marvellous tale?”

“A childish fable,”answered Giovanni, nervously starting from his chair.“I marvel how your worship finds time to read such nonsense among your graver studies.”

“By the by,”said the professor, looking uneasily about him,“what singular fragrance is this in your apartment? Is it the perfume of your gloves? It is faint, but delicious; and yet, after all, by no means agreeable. Were I to breathe it long, methinks it would make me ill. It is like the breath of a flower; but I see no flowers in the chamber.”

“Nor are there any,”replied Giovanni, who had turned pale as the professor spoke;“nor, I think, is there any fragrance except in your worship's imagination. Odors, being a sort of element combined of the sensual and the spiritual, are apt to deceive us in this manner. The recollection of a perfume, the bare idea of it, may easily be mistaken for a present reality.”

“Ay; but my sober imagination does not often play such tricks,”said Baglioni;“and, were I to fancy any kind of odor, it would be that of some vile apothecary drug, wherewith my fingers are likely enough to be imbued. Our worshipful friend Rappaccini, as I have heard, tinctures his medicaments with odors richer than those of Araby. Doubtless, likewise, the fair and learned Signora Beatrice would minister to her patients with draughts as sweet as a maiden's breath; but woe to him that sips them!”

Giovanni's face evinced many contending emotions. The tone in which the professor alluded to the pure and lovely daughter of Rappaccini was a torture to his soul; and yet the intimation of a view of her character opposite to his own, gave instantaneous distinctness to a thousand dim suspicions, which now grinned at him like so many demons. But he strove hard to quell them and to respond to Baglioni with a true lover's perfect faith.

“Signor professor,”said he,“you were my father's friend; perchance, too, it is your purpose to act a friendly part towards his son. I would fain feel nothing towards you save respect and deference; but I pray you to observe, signor, that there is one subject on which we must not speak. You know not the Signora Beatrice. You cannot, therefore, estimate the wrong—the blasphemy, I may even say—that is offered to her character by a light or injurious word.”

“Giovanni! my poor Giovanni!”answered the professor, with a calm expression of pity,“I know this wretched girl far better than yourself. You shall hear the truth in respect to the poisoner Rappaccini and his poisonous daughter; yes, poisonous as she is beautiful. Listen; for, even should you do violence to my gray hairs, it shall not silence me. That old fable of the Indian woman has become a truth by the deep and deadly science of Rappaccini and in the person of the lovely Beatrice.”

Giovanni groaned and hid his face.

“Her father,”continued Baglioni,“was not restrained by natural affection from offering up his child in this horrible manner as the victim of his insane zeal for science; for, let us do him justice, he is as true a man of science as ever distilled his own heart in an alembic. What, then, will be your fate? Beyond a doubt you are selected as the material of some new experiment. Perhaps the result is to be death; perhaps a fate more awful still. Rappaccini, with what he calls the interest of science before his eyes, will hesitate at nothing.”

“It is a dream,”muttered Giovanni to himself;“surely it is a dream.”

“But,”resumed the professor,“be of good cheer, son of my friend. It is not yet too late for the rescue. Possibly we may even succeed in bringing back this miserable child within the limits of ordinary nature, from which her father's madness has estranged her. Behold this little silver vase! It was wrought by the hands of the renowned Benvenuto Cellini, and is well worthy to be a love gift to the fairest dame in Italy. But its contents are invaluable. One little sip of this antidote would have rendered the most virulent poisons of the Borgias innocuous. Doubt not that it will be as efficacious against those of Rappaccini. Bestow the vase, and the precious liquid within it, on your Beatrice, and hopefully await the result.”

Baglioni laid a small, exquisitely wrought silver vial on the table and withdrew, leaving what he had said to produce its effect upon the young man's mind.

“We will thwart Rappaccini yet,”thought he, chuckling to himself, as he descended the stairs;“but, let us confess the truth of him, he is a wonderful man—a wonderful man indeed; a vile empiric, however, in his practice, and therefore not to be tolerated by those who respect the good old rules of the medical profession.”

Throughout Giovanni's whole acquaintance with Beatrice, he had occasionally, as we have said, been haunted by dark surmises as to her character; yet so thoroughly had she made herself felt by him as a simple, natural, most affectionate, and guileless creature, that the image now held up by Professor Baglioni looked as strange and incredible as if it were not in accordance with his own original conception. True, there were ugly recollections connected with his first glimpses of the beautiful girl; he could not quite forget the bouquet that withered in her grasp, and the insect that perished amid the sunny air, by no ostensible agency save the fragrance of her breath. These incidents, however, dissolving in the pure light of her character, had no longer the efficacy of facts, but were acknowledged as mistaken fantasies, by whatever testimony of the senses they might appear to be substantiated. There is something truer and more real than what we can see with the eyes and touch with the finger. On such better evidence had Giovanni founded his confidence in Beatrice, though rather by the necessary force of her high attributes than by any deep and generous faith on his part. But now his spirit was incapable of sustaining itself at the height to which the early enthusiasm of passion had exalted it; he fell down, grovelling among earthly doubts, and defiled therewith the pure whiteness of Beatrice's image. Not that he gave her up; he did but distrust. He resolved to institute some decisive test that should satisfy him, once for all, whether there were those dreadful peculiarities in her physical nature which could not be supposed to exist without some corresponding monstrosity of soul. His eyes, gazing down afar, might have deceived him as to the lizard, the insect, and the flowers; but if he could witness, at the distance of a few paces, the sudden blight of one fresh and healthful flower in Beatrice's hand, there would be room for no further question. With this idea he hastened to the florist's and purchased a bouquet that was still gemmed with the morning dew-drops.

It was now the customary hour of his daily interview with Beatrice. Before descending into the garden, Giovanni failed not to look at his figure in the mirror,—a vanity to be expected in a beautiful young man, yet, as displaying itself at that troubled and feverish moment, the token of a certain shallowness of feeling and insincerity of character. He did gaze, however, and said to himself that his features had never before possessed so rich a grace, nor his eyes such vivacity, nor his cheeks so warm a hue of superabundant life.

“At least,”thought he,“her poison has not yet insinuated itself into my system. I am no flower to perish in her grasp.”

With that thought he turned his eyes on the bouquet, which he had never once laid aside from his hand. A thrill of indefinable horror shot through his frame on perceiving that those dewy flowers were already beginning to droop; they wore the aspect of things that had been fresh and lovely yesterday. Giovanni grew white as marble, and stood motionless before the mirror, staring at his own reflection there as at the likeness of something frightful. He remembered Baglioni's remark about the fragrance that seemed to pervade the chamber. It must have been the poison in his breath! Then he shuddered—shuddered at himself. Recovering from his stupor, he began to watch with curious eye a spider that was busily at work hanging its web from the antique cornice of the apartment, crossing and recrossing the artful system of interwoven lines—as vigorous and active a spider as ever dangled from an old ceiling. Giovanni bent towards the insect, and emitted a deep, long breath. The spider suddenly ceased its toil; the web vibrated with a tremor originating in the body of the small artisan. Again Giovanni sent forth a breath, deeper, longer, and imbued with a venomous feeling out of his heart: he knew not whether he were wicked, or only desperate. The spider made a convulsive gripe with his limbs and hung dead across the window.

“Accursed! accursed!”muttered Giovanni, addressing himself.“Hast thou grown so poisonous that this deadly insect perishes by thy breath?”

At that moment a rich, sweet voice came floating up from the garden.

“Giovanni! Giovanni! It is past the hour! Why tarriest thou? Come down!”

“Yes,”muttered Giovanni again.“She is the only being whom my breath may not slay! Would that it might!”

He rushed down, and in an instant was standing before the bright and loving eyes of Beatrice. A moment ago his wrath and despair had been so fierce that he could have desired nothing so much as to wither her by a glance; but with her actual presence there came influences which had too real an existence to be at once shaken off: recollections of the delicate and benign power of her feminine nature, which had so often enveloped him in a religious calm; recollections of many a holy and passionate outgush of her heart, when the pure fountain had been unsealed from its depths and made visible in its transparency to his mental eye; recollections which, had Giovanni known how to estimate them, would have assured him that all this ugly mystery was but an earthly illusion, and that, whatever mist of evil might seem to have gathered over her, the real Beatrice was a heavenly angel. Incapable as he was of such high faith, still her presence had not utterly lost its magic. Giovanni's rage was quelled into an aspect of sullen insensibility. Beatrice, with a quick spiritual sense, immediately felt that there was a gulf of blackness between them which neither he nor she could pass. They walked on together, sad and silent, and came thus to the marble fountain and to its pool of water on the ground, in the midst of which grew the shrub that bore gem-like blossoms. Giovanni was affrighted at the eager enjoyment—the appetite, as it were—with which he found himself inhaling the fragrance of the flowers.

“Beatrice,”asked he, abruptly,“whence came this shrub?”

“My father created it,”answered she, with simplicity.

“Created it! created it!”repeated Giovanni.“What mean you, Beatrice?”

“He is a man fearfully acquainted with the secrets of Nature,”replied Beatrice;“and, at the hour when I first drew breath, this plant sprang from the soil, the offspring of his science, of his intellect, while I was but his earthly child. Approach it not!”continued she, observing with terror that Giovanni was drawing nearer to the shrub.“It has qualities that you little dream of. But I, dearest Giovanni,—I grew up and blossomed with the plant and was nourished with its breath. It was my sister, and I loved it with a human affection; for, alas!—hast thou not suspected it?—there was an awful doom.”

Here Giovanni frowned so darkly upon her that Beatrice paused and trembled. But her faith in his tenderness reassured her, and made her blush that she had doubted for an instant.

“There was an awful doom,”she continued,“the effect of my father's fatal love of science, which estranged me from all society of my kind. Until Heaven sent thee, dearest Giovanni, oh, how lonely was thy poor Beatrice!”

“Was it a hard doom?”asked Giovanni, fixing his eyes upon her.

“Only of late have I known how hard it was,”answered she, tenderly.“Oh, yes; but my heart was torpid, and therefore quiet.”

Giovanni's rage broke forth from his sullen gloom like a lightning flash out of a dark cloud.“Accursed one!”cried he, with venomous scorn and anger.“And, finding thy solitude wearisome, thou hast severed me likewise from all the warmth of life and enticed me into thy region of unspeakable horror!”

“Giovanni!”exclaimed Beatrice, turning her large bright eyes upon his face. The force of his words had not found its way into her mind; she was merely thunderstruck.

“Yes, poisonous thing!”repeated Giovanni, beside himself with passion.“Thou hast done it! Thou hast blasted me! Thou hast filled my veins with poison! Thou hast made me as hateful, as ugly, as loathsome and deadly a creature as thyself—a world's wonder of hideous monstrosity! Now, if our breath be happily as fatal to ourselves as to all others, let us join our lips in one kiss of unutterable hatred, and so die!”

“What has befallen me?”murmured Beatrice, with a low moan out of her heart.“Holy Virgin, pity me, a poor heart-broken child!”

“Thou,—dost thou pray?”cried Giovanni, still with the same fiendish scorn.“Thy very prayers, as they come from thy lips, taint the atmosphere with death. Yes, yes; let us pray! Let us to church and dip our fingers in the holy water at the portal! They that come after us will perish as by a pestilence! Let us sign crosses in the air! It will be scattering curses abroad in the likeness of holy symbols!”

“Giovanni,”said Beatrice, calmly, for her grief was beyond passion,“why dost thou join thyself with me thus in those terrible words? I, it is true, am the horrible thing thou namest me. But thou,—what hast thou to do, save with one other shudder at my hideous misery to go forth out of the garden and mingle with thy race, and forget that there ever crawled on earth such a monster as poor Beatrice?”

“Dost thou pretend ignorance?”asked Giovanni, scowling upon her.“Behold! this power have I gained from the pure daughter of Rappaccini.”

There was a swarm of summer insects flitting through the air in search of the food promised by the flower odors of the fatal garden. They circled round Giovanni's head, and were evidently attracted towards him by the same influence which had drawn them for an instant within the sphere of several of the shrubs. He sent forth a breath among them, and smiled bitterly at Beatrice as at least a score of the insects fell dead upon the ground.

“I see it! I see it!”shrieked Beatrice.“It is my father's fatal science! No, no, Giovanni; it was not I! Never! never! I dreamed only to love thee and be with thee a little time, and so to let thee pass away, leaving but thine image in mine heart; for, Giovanni, believe it, though my body be nourished with poison, my spirit is God's creature, and craves love as its daily food. But my father,—he has united us in this fearful sympathy. Yes; spurn me, tread upon me, kill me! Oh, what is death after such words as thine? But it was not I. Not for a world of bliss would I have done it.”

Giovanni's passion had exhausted itself in its outburst from his lips. There now came across him a sense, mournful, and not without tenderness, of the intimate and peculiar relationship between Beatrice and himself. They stood, as it were, in an utter solitude, which would be made none the less solitary by the densest throng of human life. Ought not, then, the desert of humanity around them to press this insulated pair closer together? If they should be cruel to one another, who was there to be kind to them? Besides, thought Giovanni, might there not still be a hope of his returning within the limits of ordinary nature, and leading Beatrice, the redeemed Beatrice, by the hand? O, weak, and selfish, and unworthy spirit, that could dream of an earthly union and earthly happiness as possible, after such deep love had been so bitterly wronged as was Beatrice's love by Giovanni's blighting words! No, no; there could be no such hope. She must pass heavily, with that broken heart, across the borders of Time—she must bathe her hurts in some fount of paradise, and forget her grief in the light of immortality, and THERE be well.

But Giovanni did not know it.

“Dear Beatrice,”said he, approaching her, while she shrank away as always at his approach, but now with a different impulse,“dearest Beatrice, our fate is not yet so desperate. Behold! there is a medicine, potent, as a wise physician has assured me, and almost divine in its efficacy. It is composed of ingredients the most opposite to those by which thy awful father has brought this calamity upon thee and me. It is distilled of blessed herbs. Shall we not quaff it together, and thus be purified from evil?”

“Give it me!”said Beatrice, extending her hand to receive the little silver vial which Giovanni took from his bosom. She added, with a peculiar emphasis,“I will drink; but do thou await the result.”

She put Baglioni's antidote to her lips; and, at the same moment, the figure of Rappaccini emerged from the portal and came slowly towards the marble fountain. As he drew near, the pale man of science seemed to gaze with a triumphant expression at the beautiful youth and maiden, as might an artist who should spend his life in achieving a picture or a group of statuary and finally be satisfied with his success. He paused; his bent form grew erect with conscious power; he spread out his hands over them in the attitude of a father imploring a blessing upon his children; but those were the same hands that had thrown poison into the stream of their lives. Giovanni trembled. Beatrice shuddered nervously, and pressed her hand upon her heart.

“My daughter,”said Rappaccini,“thou art no longer lonely in the world. Pluck one of those precious gems from thy sister shrub and bid thy bridegroom wear it in his bosom. It will not harm him now. My science and the sympathy between thee and him have so wrought within his system that he now stands apart from common men, as thou dost, daughter of my pride and triumph, from ordinary women. Pass on, then, through the world, most dear to one another and dreadful to all besides!”

“My father,”said Beatrice, feebly,—and still as she spoke she kept her hand upon her heart,—“wherefore didst thou inflict this miserable doom upon thy child?”

“Miserable!”exclaimed Rappaccini.“What mean you, foolish girl? Dost thou deem it misery to be endowed with marvellous gifts against which no power nor strength could avail an enemy—misery, to be able to quell the mightiest with a breath—misery, to be as terrible as thou art beautiful? Wouldst thou, then, have preferred the condition of a weak woman, exposed to all evil and capable of none?”

“I would fain have been loved, not feared,”murmured Beatrice, sinking down upon the ground.“But now it matters not. I am going, father, where the evil which thou hast striven to mingle with my being will pass away like a dream-like the fragrance of these poisonous flowers, which will no longer taint my breath among the flowers of Eden. Farewell, Giovanni! Thy words of hatred are like lead within my heart; but they, too, will fall away as I ascend. Oh, was there not, from the first, more poison in thy nature than in mine?”

To Beatrice,—so radically had her earthly part been wrought upon by Rappaccini's skill,—as poison had been life, so the powerful antidote was death; and thus the poor victim of man's ingenuity and of thwarted nature, and of the fatality that attends all such efforts of perverted wisdom, perished there, at the feet of her father and Giovanni. Just at that moment Professor Pietro Baglioni looked forth from the window, and called loudly, in a tone of triumph mixed with horror, to the thunderstricken man of science,—“Rappaccini! Rappaccini! and is THIS the upshot of your experiment!”





THE MINISTER'S BLACK VEIL

A PARABLE(1)


The sexton stood in the porch of Milford meeting-house, pulling busily at the bell-rope. The old people of the village came stooping along the street. Children, with bright faces, tripped merrily beside their parents, or mimicked a graver gait, in the conscious dignity of their Sunday clothes. Spruce bachelors looked sidelong at the pretty maidens, and fancied that the Sabbath sunshine made them prettier than on weekdays. When the throng had mostly streamed into the porch, the sexton began to toll the bell, keeping his eye on the Reverend Mr. Hooper's door. The first glimpse of the clergyman's figure was the signal for the bell to cease its summons.

“But what has good Parson Hooper got upon his face?”cried the sexton in astonishment.

All within hearing immediately turned about, and beheld the semblance of Mr. Hooper, pacing slowly his meditative way towards the meeting-house. With one accord they started, expressing more wonder than if some strange minister were coming to dust the cushions of Mr. Hooper's pulpit.

“Are you sure it is our parson?”inquired Goodman Gray of the sexton.

“Of a certainty it is good Mr. Hooper,”replied the sexton.“He was to have exchanged pulpits with Parson Shute, of Westbury; but Parson Shute sent to excuse himself yesterday, being to preach a funeral sermon.”

The cause of so much amazement may appear sufficiently slight. Mr. Hooper, a gentlemanly person, of about thirty, though still a bachelor, was dressed with due clerical neatness, as if a careful wife had starched his band, and brushed the weekly dust from his Sunday's garb. There was but one thing remarkable in his appearance. Swathed about his forehead, and hanging down over his face, so low as to be shaken by his breath, Mr. Hooper had on a black veil. On a nearer view it seemed to consist of two folds of crepe, which entirely concealed his features, except the mouth and chin, but probably did not intercept his sight, further than to give a darkened aspect to all living and inanimate things. With this gloomy shade before him, good Mr. Hooper walked onward, at a slow and quiet pace, stooping somewhat, and looking on the ground, as is customary with abstracted men, yet nodding kindly to those of his parishioners who still waited on the meeting-house steps. But so wonder-struck were they that his greeting hardly met with a return.

“I can't really feel as if good Mr. Hooper's face was behind that piece of crape,”said the sexton.

“I don't like it,”muttered an old woman, as she hobbled into the meeting-house.“He has changed himself into something awful, only by hiding his face.”

“Our parson has gone mad!”cried Goodman Gray, following him across the threshold.

A rumor of some unaccountable phenomenon had preceded Mr. Hooper into the meeting-house, and set all the congregation astir. Few could refrain from twisting their heads towards the door; many stood upright, and turned directly about; while several little boys clambered upon the seats, and came down again with a terrible racket. There was a general bustle, a rustling of the women's gowns and shuffling of the men's feet, greatly at variance with that hushed repose which should attend the entrance of the minister. But Mr. Hooper appeared not to notice the perturbation of his people. He entered with an almost noiseless step, bent his head mildly to the pews on each side, and bowed as he passed his oldest parishioner, a white-haired great-grandsire, who occupied an arm-chair in the centre of the aisle. It was strange to observe how slowly this venerable man became conscious of something singular in the appearance of his pastor. He seemed not fully to partake of the prevailing wonder, till Mr. Hooper had ascended the stairs, and showed himself in the pulpit, face to face with his congregation, except for the black veil. That mysterious emblem was never once withdrawn. It shook with his measured breath, as he gave out the psalm; it threw its obscurity between him and the holy page, as he read the Scriptures; and while he prayed, the veil lay heavily on his uplifted countenance. Did he seek to hide it from the dread Being whom he was addressing?

Such was the effect of this simple piece of crape, that more than one woman of delicate nerves was forced to leave the meeting-house. Yet perhaps the pale-faced congregation was almost as fearful a sight to the minister, as his black veil to them.

Mr. Hooper had the reputation of a good preacher, but not an energetic one: he strove to win his people heavenward by mild, persuasive influences, rather than to drive them thither by the thunders of the word. The sermon which he now delivered was marked by the same characteristics of style and manner as the general series of his pulpit oratory. But there was something, either in the sentiment of the discourse itself, or in the imagination of the auditors, which made it greatly the most powerful effort that they had ever heard from their pastor's lips. It was tinged, rather more darkly than usual, with the gentle gloom of Mr. Hooper's temperament. The subject had reference to secret sin, and those sad mysteries which we hide from our nearest and dearest, and would fain conceal from our own consciousness, even forgetting that the Omniscient can detect them. A subtle power was breathed into his words. Each member of the congregation, the most innocent girl, and the man of hardened breast, felt as if the preacher had crept upon them, behind his awful veil, and discovered their hoarded iniquity of deed or thought. Many spread their clasped hands on their bosoms. There was nothing terrible in what Mr. Hooper said, at least, no violence; and yet, with every tremor of his melancholy voice, the hearers quaked. An unsought pathos came hand in hand with awe. So sensible were the audience of some unwonted attribute in their minister, that they longed for a breath of wind to blow aside the veil, almost believing that a stranger's visage would be discovered, though the form, gesture, and voice were those of Mr. Hooper.

At the close of the services, the people hurried out with in-decorous confusion, eager to communicate their pent-up amazement, and conscious of lighter spirits the moment they lost sight of the black veil. Some gathered in little circles, huddled closely together, with their mouths all whispering in the centre; some went homeward alone, wrapt in silent meditation; some talked loudly, and profaned the Sabbath day with ostentatious laughter. A few shook their sagacious heads, intimating that they could penetrate the mystery; while one or two affirmed that there was no mystery at all, but only that Mr. Hooper's eyes were so weakened by the midnight lamp, as to require a shade. After a brief interval, forth came good Mr. Hooper also, in the rear of his flock. Turning his veiled face from one group to another, he paid due reverence to the hoary heads, saluted the middle aged with kind dignity as their friend and spiritual guide, greeted the young with mingled authority and love, and laid his hands on the little children's heads to bless them. Such was always his custom on the Sabbath day. Strange and bewildered looks repaid him for his courtesy. None, as on former occasions, aspired to the honor of walking by their pastor's side. Old Squire Saunders, doubtless by an accidental lapse of memory, neglected to invite Mr. Hooper to his table, where the good clergyman had been wont to bless the food, almost every Sunday since his settlement. He returned, therefore, to the parsonage, and, at the moment of closing the door, was observed to look back upon the people, all of whom had their eyes fixed upon the minister. A sad smile gleamed faintly from beneath the black veil, and flickered about his mouth, glimmering as he disappeared.

“How strange,”said a lady,“that a simple black veil, such as any woman might wear on her bonnet should become such a terrible thing on Mr. Hooper's face!”

“Something must surely be amiss with Mr. Hooper's intellects,”observed her husband, the physician of the village.“But the strangest part of the affair is the effect of this vagary, even on a sober-minded man like myself. The black veil, though it covers only our pastor's face, throws its influence over his whole person, and makes him ghostlike from head to foot. Do you not feel it so?”

“Truly do I,”replied the lady;“and I would not be alone with him for the world. I wonder he is not afraid to be alone with himself!”

“Men sometimes are so,”said her husband.

The afternoon service was attended with similar circumstances. At its conclusion, the bell tolled for the funeral of a young lady. The relatives and friends were assembled in the house, and the more distant acquaintances stood about the door, speaking of the good qualities of the deceased, when their talk was interrupted by the appearance of Mr. Hooper, still covered with his black veil. It was now an appropriate emblem. The clergyman stepped into the room where the corpse was laid, and bent over the coffin, to take a last farewell of his deceased parishioner. As he stooped, the veil hung straight down from his forehead, so that, if her eyelids had not been closed forever, the dead maiden might have seen his face. Could Mr. Hooper be fearful of her glance, that he so hastily caught back the black veil? A person who watched the interview between the dead and living, scrupled not to affirm, that, at the instant when the clergyman's features were disclosed, the corpse had slightly shuddered, rustling the shroud and muslin cap, though the countenance retained the composure of death. A superstitious old woman was the only witness of this prodigy. From the coffin Mr. Hooper passed into the chamber of the mourners, and thence to the head of the staircase, to make the funeral prayer. It was a tender and heart-dissolving prayer, full of sorrow, yet so imbued with celestial hopes, that the music of a heavenly harp, swept by the fingers of the dead, seemed faintly to be heard among the saddest accents of the minister. The people trembled, though they but darkly understood him when he prayed that they, and himself, and all of mortal race, might be ready, as he trusted this young maiden had been, for the dreadful hour that should snatch the veil from their faces. The bearers went heavily forth, and the mourners followed, saddening all the street, with the dead before them, and Mr. Hooper in his black veil behind.

“Why do you look back?”said one in the procession to his partner.

“I had a fancy,”replied she,“that the minister and the maiden's spirit were walking hand in hand.”

“And so had I, at the same moment,”said the other.

That night, the handsomest couple in Milford village were to be joined in wedlock. Though reckoned a melancholy man, Mr. Hooper had a placid cheerfulness for such occasions, which often excited a sympathetic smile where livelier merriment would have been thrown away. There was no quality of his disposition which made him more beloved than this. The company at the wedding awaited his arrival with impatience, trusting that the strange awe, which had gathered over him throughout the day, would now be dispelled. But such was not the result. When Mr. Hooper came, the first thing that their eyes rested on was the same horrible black veil, which had added deeper gloom to the funeral, and could portend nothing but evil to the wedding. Such was its immediate effect on the guests that a cloud seemed to have rolled duskily from beneath the black crape, and dimmed the light of the candles. The bridal pair stood up before the minister. But the bride's cold fingers quivered in the tremulous hand of the bridegroom, and her deathlike paleness caused a whisper that the maiden who had been buried a few hours before was come from her grave to be married. If ever another wedding were so dismal, it was that famous one where they tolled the wedding knell. After performing the ceremony, Mr. Hooper raised a glass of wine to his lips, wishing happiness to the new-married couple in a strain of mild pleasantry that ought to have brightened the features of the guests, like a cheerful gleam from the hearth. At that instant, catching a glimpse of his figure in the looking-glass, the black veil involved his own spirit in the horror with which it overwhelmed all others. His frame shuddered, his lips grew white, he spilt the untasted wine upon the carpet, and rushed forth into the darkness. For the Earth, too, had on her Black Veil.

The next day, the whole village of Milford talked of little else than Parson Hooper's black veil. That, and the mystery concealed behind it, supplied a topic for discussion between acquaintances meeting in the street, and good women gossiping at their open windows. It was the first item of news that the tavern-keeper told to his guests. The children babbled of it on their way to school. One imitative little imp covered his face with an old black handkerchief, thereby so affrighting his playmates that the panic seized himself, and he well-nigh lost his wits by his own waggery.

It was remarkable that of all the busybodies and impertinent people in the parish, not one ventured to put the plain question to Mr. Hooper, wherefore he did this thing. Hitherto, whenever there appeared the slightest call for such interference, he had never lacked advisers, nor shown himself averse to be guided by their judgment. If he erred at all, it was by so painful a degree of self-distrust, that even the mildest censure would lead him to consider an indifferent action as a crime. Yet, though so well acquainted with this amiable weakness, no individual among his parishioners chose to make the black veil a subject of friendly remonstrance. There was a feeling of dread, neither plainly confessed nor carefully concealed, which caused each to shift the responsibility upon another, till at length it was found expedient to send a deputation of the church, in order to deal with Mr. Hooper about the mystery, before it should grow into a scandal. Never did an embassy so ill discharge its duties. The minister received them with friendly courtesy, but became silent, after they were seated, leaving to his visitors the whole burden of introducing their important business. The topic, it might be supposed, was obvious enough. There was the black veil swathed round Mr. Hooper's forehead, and concealing every feature above his placid mouth, on which, at times, they could perceive the glimmering of a melancholy smile. But that piece of crape, to their imagination, seemed to hang down before his heart, the symbol of a fearful secret between him and them. Were the veil but cast aside, they might speak freely of it, but not till then. Thus they sat a considerable time, speechless, confused, and shrinking uneasily from Mr. Hooper's eye, which they felt to be fixed upon them with an invisible glance. Finally, the deputies returned abashed to their constituents, pronouncing the matter too weighty to be handled, except by a council of the churches, if, indeed, it might not require a general synod.

But there was one person in the village unappalled by the awe with which the black veil had impressed all beside herself. When the deputies returned without an explanation, or even venturing to demand one, she, with the calm energy of her character, determined to chase away the strange cloud that appeared to be settling round Mr. Hooper, every moment more darkly than before. As his plighted wife, it should be her privilege to know what the black veil concealed. At the minister's first visit, therefore, she entered upon the subject with a direct simplicity, which made the task easier both for him and her. After he had seated himself, she fixed her eyes steadfastly upon the veil, but could discern nothing of the dreadful gloom that had so overawed the multitude: it was but a double fold of crape, hanging down from his forehead to his mouth, and slightly stirring with his breath.

“No,”said she aloud, and smiling,“there is nothing terrible in this piece of crape, except that it hides a face which I am always glad to look upon. Come, good sir, let the sun shine from behind the cloud. First lay aside your black veil: then tell me why you put it on.”

Mr. Hooper's smile glimmered faintly.

“There is an hour to come,”said he,“when all of us shall cast aside our veils. Take it not amiss, beloved friend, if I wear this piece of crape till then.”

“Your words are a mystery, too,”returned the young lady.“Take away the veil from them, at least.”

“Elizabeth, I will,”said he,“so far as my vow may suffer me. Know, then, this veil is a type and a symbol, and I am bound to wear it ever, both in light and darkness, in solitude and before the gaze of multitudes, and as with strangers, so with my familiar friends. No mortal eye will see it withdrawn. This dismal shade must separate me from the world: even you, Elizabeth, can never come behind it!”

“What grievous affliction hath befallen you,”she earnestly inquired,“that you should thus darken your eyes forever?”

“If it be a sign of mourning,”replied Mr. Hooper,“I, perhaps, like most other mortals, have sorrows dark enough to be typified by a black veil.”

“But what if the world will not believe that it is the type of an innocent sorrow?”urged Elizabeth.“Beloved and respected as you are, there may be whispers that you hide your face under the consciousness of secret sin. For the sake of your holy office, do away this scandal!”

The color rose into her cheeks as she intimated the nature of the rumors that were already abroad in the village. But Mr. Hooper's mildness did not forsake him. He even smiled again—that same sad smile, which always appeared like a faint glimmering of light, proceeding from the obscurity beneath the veil.

“If I hide my face for sorrow, there is cause enough,”he merely replied;“and if I cover it for secret sin, what mortal might not do the same?”

And with this gentle, but unconquerable obstinacy did he resist all her entreaties. At length Elizabeth sat silent. For a few moments she appeared lost in thought, considering, probably, what new methods might be tried to withdraw her lover from so dark a fantasy, which, if it had no other meaning, was perhaps a symptom of mental disease. Though of a firmer character than his own, the tears rolled down her cheeks. But, in an instant, as it were, a new feeling took the place of sorrow: her eyes were fixed insensibly on the black veil, when, like a sudden twilight in the air, its terrors fell around her. She arose, and stood trembling before him.

“And do you feel it then, at last?”said he, mournfully.

She made no reply, but covered her eyes with her hand, and turned to leave the room. He rushed forward and caught her arm.

“Have patience with me, Elizabeth!”cried he, passionately.“Do not desert me, though this veil must be between us here on earth. Be mine, and hereafter there shall be no veil over my face, no darkness between our souls! It is but a mortal veil—it is not for eternity! Oh, you know not how lonely I am, and how frightened, to be alone behind my black veil. Do not leave me in this miserable obscurity forever!”

“Lift the veil but once, and look me in the face,”said she.

“Never! It cannot be!”replied Mr. Hooper.

“Then farewell!”said Elizabeth.

She withdrew her arm from his grasp, and slowly departed, pausing at the door, to give one long shuddering gaze, that seemed almost to penetrate the mystery of the black veil. But, even amid his grief, Mr. Hooper smiled to think that only a material emblem had separated him from happiness, though the horrors, which it shadowed forth, must be drawn darkly between the fondest of lovers.

From that time no attempts were made to remove Mr. Hooper's black veil, or, by a direct appeal, to discover the secret which it was supposed to hide. By persons who claimed a superiority to popular prejudice, it was reckoned merely an eccentric whim, such as often mingles with the sober actions of men otherwise rational, and tinges them all with its own semblance of insanity. But with the multitude, good Mr. Hooper was irreparably a bugbear. He could not walk the street with any peace of mind, so conscious was he that the gentle and timid would turn aside to avoid him, and that others would make it a point of hardihood to throw themselves in his way. The impertinence of the latter class compelled him to give up his customary walk at sunset to the burialground; for when he leaned pensively over the gate, there would always be faces behind the gravestones, peeping at his black veil. A fable went the rounds that the stare of the dead people drove him thence. It grieved him, to the very depth of his kind heart, to observe how the children fled from his approach, breaking up their merriest sports, while his melancholy figure was yet afar off. Their instinctive dread caused him to feel more strongly than aught else, that a preternatural horror was interwoven with the threads of the black crape. In truth, his own antipathy to the veil was known to be so great, that he never willingly passed before a mirror, nor stooped to drink at a still fountain, lest, in its peaceful bosom, he should be affrighted by himself. This was what gave plausibility to the whispers, that Mr. Hooper's conscience tortured him for some great crime too horrible to be entirely concealed, or otherwise than so obscurely intimated. Thus, from beneath the black veil, there rolled a cloud into the sunshine, an ambiguity of sin or sorrow, which enveloped the poor minister, so that love or sympathy could never reach him. It was said that ghost and fiend consorted with him there. With self-shudderings and outward terrors, he walked continually in its shadow, groping darkly within his own soul, or gazing through a medium that saddened the whole world. Even the lawless wind, it was believed, respected his dreadful secret, and never blew aside the veil. But still good Mr. Hooper sadly smiled at the pale visages of the worldly throng as he passed by.

Among all its bad influences, the black veil had the one desirable effect, of making its wearer a very efficient clergyman. By the aid of his mysterious emblem—for there was no other apparent cause—he became a man of awful power over souls that were in agony for sin. His converts always regarded him with a dread peculiar to themselves, affirming, though but figuratively, that, before he brought them to celestial light, they had been with him behind the black veil. Its gloom, indeed, enabled him to sympathize with all dark affections. Dying sinners cried aloud for Mr. Hooper, and would not yield their breath till he appeared; though ever, as he stooped to whisper consolation, they shuddered at the veiled face so near their own. Such were the terrors of the black veil, even when Death had bared his visage! Strangers came long distances to attend service at his church, with the mere idle purpose of gazing at his figure, because it was forbidden them to behold his face. But many were made to quake ere they departed! Once, during Governor Belcher's administration, Mr. Hooper was appointed to preach the election sermon. Covered with his black veil, he stood before the chief magistrate, the council, and the representatives, and wrought so deep an impression, that the legislative measures of that year were characterized by all the gloom and piety of our earliest ancestral sway.

In this manner Mr. Hooper spent a long life, irreproachable in outward act, yet shrouded in dismal suspicions; kind and loving, though unloved, and dimly feared; a man apart from men, shunned in their health and joy, but ever summoned to their aid in mortal anguish. As years wore on, shedding their snows above his sable veil, he acquired a name throughout the New England churches, and they called him Father Hooper. Nearly all his parishioners, who were of mature age when he was settled, had been borne away by many a funeral: he had one congregation in the church, and a more crowded one in the churchyard; and having wrought so late into the evening, and done his work so well, it was now good Father Hooper's turn to rest.

Several persons were visible by the shaded candlelight, in the death chamber of the old clergyman. Natural connections he had none. But there was the decorously grave, though unmoved physician, seeking only to mitigate the last pangs of the patient whom he could not save. There were the deacons, and other eminently pious members of his church. There, also, was the Reverend Mr. Clark, of Westbury, a young and zealous divine, who had ridden in haste to pray by the bedside of the expiring minister. There was the nurse, no hired handmaiden of death, but one whose calm affection had endured thus long in secrecy, in solitude, amid the chill of age, and would not perish, even at the dying hour. Who, but Elizabeth! And there lay the hoary head of good Father Hooper upon the death pillow, with the black veil still swathed about his brow, and reaching down over his face, so that each more difficult gasp of his faint breath caused it to stir. All through life that piece of crape had hung between him and the world: it had separated him from cheerful brotherhood and woman's love, and kept him in that saddest of all prisons, his own heart; and still it lay upon his face, as if to deepen the gloom of his darksome chamber, and shade him from the sunshine of eternity.

For some time previous, his mind had been confused, wavering doubtfully between the past and the present, and hovering forward, as it were, at intervals, into the indistinctness of the world to come. There had been feverish turns, which tossed him from side to side, and wore away what little strength he had. But in his most convulsive struggles, and in the wildest vagaries of his intellect, when no other thought retained its sober influence, he still showed an awful solicitude lest the black veil should slip aside. Even if his bewildered soul could have forgotten, there was a faithful woman at his pillow, who, with averted eyes, would have covered that aged face, which she had last beheld in the comeliness of manhood. At length the death-stricken old man lay quietly in the torpor of mental and bodily exhaustion, with an imperceptible pulse, and breath that grew fainter and fainter, except when a long, deep, and irregular inspiration seemed to prelude the flight of his spirit.

The minister of Westbury approached the bedside.

“Venerable Father Hooper,”said he,“the moment of your release is at hand. Are you ready for the lifting of the veil that shuts in time from eternity?”

Father Hooper at first replied merely by a feeble motion of his head; then, apprehensive, perhaps, that his meaning might be doubtful, he exerted himself to speak.

“Yea,”said he, in faint accents,“my soul hath a patient weariness until that veil be lifted.”

“And is it fitting,”resumed the Reverend Mr. Clark,“that a man so given to prayer, of such a blameless example, holy in deed and thought, so far as mortal judgment may pronounce; is it fitting that a father in the church should leave a shadow on his memory, that may seem to blacken a life so pure? I pray you, my venerable brother, let not this thing be! Suffer us to be gladdened by your triumphant aspect as you go to your reward. Before the veil of eternity be lifted, let me cast aside this black veil from your face!”

And, thus speaking, the Reverend Mr. Clark bent forward to reveal the mystery of so many years. But, exerting a sudden energy, that made all the beholders stand aghast, Father Hooper snatched both his hands from beneath the bedclothes, and pressed them strongly on the black veil, resolute to struggle, if the minister of Westbury would contend with a dying man.

“Never!”cried the veiled clergyman.“On earth, never!”

“Dark old man!”exclaimed the affrighted minister,“with what horrible crime upon your soul are you now passing to the judgment?”

Father Hooper's breath heaved; it rattled in his throat; but, with a mighty effort, grasping forward with his hands, he caught hold of life, and held it back till he should speak. He even raised himself in bed; and there he sat; shivering with the arms of death around him, while the black veil hung down, awful, at that last moment, in the gathered terrors of a lifetime. And yet the faint, sad smile, so often there, now seemed to glimmer from its obscurity, and linger on Father Hooper's lips.

“Why do you tremble at me alone?”cried he, turning his veiled face round the circle of pale spectators.“Tremble also at each other! Have men avoided me, and women shown no pity, and children screamed and fled, only for my black veil? What, but the mystery which it obscurely typifies, has made this piece of crape so awful? When the friend shows his inmost heart to his friend; the lover to his best beloved; when man does not vainly shrink from the eye of his Creator, loathsomely treasuring up the secret of his sin; then deem me a monster, for the symbol beneath which I have lived, and die! I look around me, and, lo! on every visage a Black Veil!”

While his auditors shrank from one another, in mutual affright, Father Hooper fell back upon his pillow, a veiled corpse, with a faint smile lingering on the lips. Still veiled, they laid him in his coffin, and a veiled corpse they bore him to the grave. The grass of many years has sprung up and withered on that grave, the burial stone is moss-grown, and good Mr. Hooper's face is dust; but awful is still the thought that it mouldered beneath the Black Veil!

(1) Another clergyman in New England, Mr. Joseph Moody, of York, Maine, who died about eighty years since, made himself remarkable by the same eccentricity that is here related of the Reverend Mr. Hooper. In his case, however, the symbol had a different import. In early life he had accidentally killed a beloved friend; and from that day till the hour of his own death, he hid his face from men.





LADY ELEANORE'S MANTLE


Not long after Colonel Shute had assumed the government of Massachusetts Bay, now nearly a hundred and twenty years ago, a young lady of rank and fortune arrived from England, to claim his protection as her guardian. He was her distant relative, but the nearest who had survived the gradual extinction of her family; so that no more eligible shelter could be found for the rich and high-born Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe than within the Province House of a transatlantic colony. The consort of Governor Shute, moreover, had been as a mother to her childhood, and was now anxious to receive her, in the hope that a beautiful young woman would be exposed to infinitely less peril from the primitive society of New England than amid the artifices and corruptions of a court. If either the Governor or his lady had especially consulted their own comfort, they would probably have sought to devolve the responsibility on other hands; since, with some noble and splendid traits of character, Lady Eleanore was remarkable for a harsh, unyielding pride, a haughty consciousness of her hereditary and personal advantages, which made her almost incapable of control. Judging from many traditionary anecdotes, this peculiar temper was hardly less than a monomania; or, if the acts which it inspired were those of a sane person, it seemed due from Providence that pride so sinful should be followed by as severe a retribution. That tinge of the marvellous, which is thrown over so many of these half-forgotten legends, has probably imparted an additional wildness to the strange story of Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe.

The ship in which she came passenger had arrived at Newport, whence Lady Eleanore was conveyed to Boston in the Governor's coach, attended by a small escort of gentlemen on horseback. The ponderous equipage, with its four black horses, attracted much notice as it rumbled through Cornhill, surrounded by the prancing steeds of half a dozen cavaliers, with swords dangling to their stirrups and pistols at their holsters. Through the large glass windows of the coach, as it rolled along, the people could discern the figure of Lady Eleanore, strangely combining an almost queenly stateliness with the grace and beauty of a maiden in her teens. A singular tale had gone abroad among the ladies of the province, that their fair rival was indebted for much of the irresistible charm of her appearance to a certain article of dress—an embroidered mantle—which had been wrought by the most skilful artist in London, and possessed even magical properties of adornment. On the present occasion, however, she owed nothing to the witchery of dress, being clad in a riding habit of velvet, which would have appeared stiff and ungraceful on any other form.

The coachman reined in his four black steeds, and the whole cavalcade came to a pause in front of the contorted iron balustrade that fenced the Province House from the public street. It was an awkward coincidence that the bell of the Old South was just then tolling for a funeral; so that, instead of a gladsome peal with which it was customary to announce the arrival of distinguished strangers, Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe was ushered by a doleful clang, as if calamity had come embodied in her beautiful person.

“A very great disrespect!”exclaimed Captain Langford, an English officer, who had recently brought dispatches to Governor Shute.“The funeral should have been deferred, lest Lady Eleanore's spirits be affected by such a dismal welcome.”

“With your pardon, sir,”replied Dr. Clarke, a physician, and a famous champion of the popular party,“whatever the heralds may pretend, a dead beggar must have precedence of a living queen. King Death confers high privileges.”

These remarks were interchanged while the speakers waited a passage through the crowd, which had gathered on each side of the gateway, leaving an open avenue to the portal of the Province House. A black slave in livery now leaped from behind the coach, and threw open the door; while at the same moment Governor Shute descended the flight of steps from his mansion, to assist Lady Eleanore in alighting. But the Governor's stately approach was anticipated in a manner that excited general astonishment. A pale young man, with his black hair all in disorder, rushed from the throng, and prostrated himself beside the coach, thus offering his person as a footstool for Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe to tread upon. She held back an instant, yet with an expression as if doubting whether the young man were worthy to bear the weight of her footstep, rather than dissatisfied to receive such awful reverence from a fellow-mortal.

“Up, sir,”said the Governor, sternly, at the same time lifting his cane over the intruder.“What means the Bedlamite by this freak?”

“Nay,”answered Lady Eleanore playfully, but with more scorn than pity in her tone,“your Excellency shall not strike him. When men seek only to be trampled upon, it were a pity to deny them a favor so easily granted—and so well deserved!”

Then, though as lightly as a sunbeam on a cloud, she placed her foot upon the cowering form, and extended her hand to meet that of the Governor.

There was a brief interval during which Lady Eleanore retained this attitude; and never, surely, was there an apter emblem of aristocracy and hereditary pride trampling on human sympathies and the kindred of nature, than these two figures presented at that moment. Yet the spectators were so smitten with her beauty, and so essential did pride seem to the existence of such a creature, that they gave a simultaneous acclamation of applause.

“Who is this insolent young fellow?”inquired Captain Langford, who still remained beside Dr. Clarke.“If he be in his senses, his impertinence demands the bastinado. If mad, Lady Eleanore should be secured from further inconvenience, by his confinement.”

“His name is Jervase Helwyse,”answered the Doctor;“a youth of no birth or fortune, or other advantages, save the mind and soul that nature gave him; and being secretary to our colonial agent in London, it was his misfortune to meet this Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe. He loved her—and her scorn has driven him mad.”

“He was mad so to aspire,”observed the English officer.

“It may be so,”said Dr. Clarke, frowning as he spoke.“But I tell you, sir, I could well-nigh doubt the justice of the Heaven above us if no signal humiliation overtake this lady, who now treads so haughtily into yonder mansion. She seeks to place herself above the sympathies of our common nature, which envelops all human souls. See, if that nature do not assert its claim over her in some mode that shall bring her level with the lowest!”

“Never!”cried Captain Langford indignantly—“neither in life, nor when they lay her with her ancestors.”

Not many days afterwards the Governor gave a ball in honor of Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe. The principal gentry of the colony received invitations, which were distributed to their residences, far and near, by messengers on horseback, bearing missives sealed with all the formality of official dispatches. In obedience to the summons, there was a general gathering of rank, wealth, and beauty; and the wide door of the Province House had seldom given admittance to more numerous and honorable guests than on the evening of Lady Eleanore's ball. Without much extravagance of eulogy, the spectacle might even be termed splendid; for, according to the fashion of the times, the ladies shone in rich silks and satins, outspread over wide projecting hoops; and the gentlemen glittered in gold embroidery, laid unsparingly upon the purple, or scarlet, or sky-blue velvet, which was the material of their coats and waistcoats. The latter article of dress was of great importance, since it enveloped the wearer's body nearly to the knees, and was perhaps bedizened with the amount of his whole year's income, in golden flowers and foliage. The altered taste of the present day—a taste symbolic of a deep change in the whole system of society—would look upon almost any of those gorgeous figures as ridiculous; although that evening the guests sought their reflections in the pier-glasses, and rejoiced to catch their own glitter amid the glittering crowd. What a pity that one of the stately mirrors has not preserved a picture of the scene, which, by the very traits that were so transitory, might have taught us much that would be worth knowing and remembering!

Would, at least, that either painter or mirror could convey to us some faint idea of a garment, already noticed in this legend,—the Lady Eleanore's embroidered mantle,—which the gossips whispered was invested with magic properties, so as to lend a new and untried grace to her figure each time that she put it on! Idle fancy as it is, this mysterious mantle has thrown an awe around my image of her, partly from its fabled virtues, and partly because it was the handiwork of a dying woman, and, perchance, owed the fantastic grace of its conception to the delirium of approaching death.

After the ceremonial greetings had been paid, Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe stood apart from the mob of guests, insulating herself within a small and distinguished circle, to whom she accorded a more cordial favor than to the general throng. The waxen torches threw their radiance vividly over the scene, bringing out its brilliant points in strong relief; but she gazed carelessly, and with now and then an expression of weariness or scorn, tempered with such feminine grace that her auditors scarcely perceived the moral deformity of which it was the utterance. She beheld the spectacle not with vulgar ridicule, as disdaining to be pleased with the provincial mockery of a court festival, but with the deeper scorn of one whose spirit held itself too high to participate in the enjoyment of other human souls. Whether or no the recollections of those who saw her that evening were influenced by the strange events with which she was subsequently connected, so it was that her figure ever after recurred to them as marked by something wild and unnatural,— although, at the time, the general whisper was of her exceeding beauty, and of the indescribable charm which her mantle threw around her. Some close observers, indeed, detected a feverish flush and alternate paleness of countenance, with a corresponding flow and revulsion of spirits, and once or twice a painful and helpless betrayal of lassitude, as if she were on the point of sinking to the ground. Then, with a nervous shudder, she seemed to arouse her energies and threw some bright and playful yet half-wicked sarcasm into the conversation. There was so strange a characteristic in her manners and sentiments that it astonished every right-minded listener; till; looking in her face, a lurking and incomprehensible glance and smile perplexed them with doubts both as to her seriousness and sanity. Gradually, Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe's circle grew smaller, till only four gentlemen remained in it. These were Captain Langford, the English officer before mentioned; a Virginian planter, who had come to Massachusetts on some political errand; a young Episcopal clergyman, the grandson of a British earl; and, lastly, the private secretary of Governor Shute, whose obsequiousness had won a sort of tolerance from Lady Eleanore.

At different periods of the evening the liveried servants of the Province House passed among the guests, bearing huge trays of refreshments and French and Spanish wines. Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe, who refused to wet her beautiful lips even with a bubble of Champagne, had sunk back into a large damask chair, apparently overwearied either with the excitement of the scene or its tedium, and while, for an instant, she was unconscious of voices, laughter and music, a young man stole forward, and knelt down at her feet. He bore a salver in his hand, on which was a chased silver goblet, filled to the brim with wine, which he offered as reverentially as to a crowned queen, or rather with the awful devotion of a priest doing sacrifice to his idol. Conscious that some one touched her robe, Lady Eleanore started, and unclosed her eyes upon the pale, wild features and dishevelled hair of Jervase Helwyse.

“Why do you haunt me thus?”said she, in a languid tone, but with a kindlier feeling than she ordinarily permitted herself to express.“They tell me that I have done you harm.”

“Heaven knows if that be so,”replied the young man solemnly.“But, Lady Eleanore, in requital of that harm, if such there be, and for your own earthly and heavenly welfare, I pray you to take one sip of this holy wine, and then to pass the goblet round among the guests. And this shall be a symbol that you have not sought to withdraw yourself from the chain of human sympathies—which whoso would shake off must keep company with fallen angels.”

“Where has this mad fellow stolen that sacramental vessel?”exclaimed the Episcopal clergyman.

This question drew the notice of the guests to the silver cup, which was recognized as appertaining to the communion plate of the Old South Church; and, for aught that could be known, it was brimming over with the consecrated wine.

“Perhaps it is poisoned,”half whispered the Governor's secretary.

“Pour it down the villain's throat!”cried the Virginian fiercely.

“Turn him out of the house!”cried Captain Langford, seizing Jervase Helwyse so roughly by the shoulder that the sacramental cup was overturned, and its contents sprinkled upon Lady Eleanore's mantle.“Whether knave, fool, or Bedlamite, it is intolerable that the fellow should go at large.”

“Pray, gentlemen, do my poor admirer no harm,”said Lady Eleanore, with a faint and weary smile.“Take him out of my sight, if such be your pleasure; for I can find in my heart to do nothing but laugh at him; whereas, in all decency and conscience, it would become me to weep for the mischief I have wrought!”

But while the by-standers were attempting to lead away the unfortunate young man, he broke from them, and with a wild, impassioned earnestness, offered a new and equally strange petition to Lady Eleanore. It was no other than that she should throw off the mantle, which, while he pressed the silver cup of wine upon her, she had drawn more closely around her form, so as almost to shroud herself within it.

“Cast it from you!”exclaimed Jervase Helwyse, clasping his hands in an agony of entreaty.“It may not yet be too late! Give the accursed garment to the flames!”

But Lady Eleanore, with a laugh of scorn, drew the rich folds of the embroidered mantle over her head, in such a fashion as to give a completely new aspect to her beautiful face, which—half hidden, half revealed—seemed to belong to some being of mysterious character and purposes.

“Farewell, Jervase Helwyse!”said she.“Keep my image in your remembrance, as you behold it now.”

“Alas, lady!”he replied, in a tone no longer wild, but sad as a funeral bell—“We must meet shortly, when your face may wear another aspect—and that shall be the image that must abide within me.”

He made no more resistance to the violent efforts of the gentle-men and servants, who almost dragged him out of the apartment, and dismissed him roughly from the iron gate of the Province House. Captain Langford, who had been very active in this affair, was returning to the presence of Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe, when he encountered the physician, Dr. Clarke, with whom he had held some casual talk on the day of her arrival. The Doctor stood apart, separated from Lady Eleanore by the width of the room, but eying her with such keen sagacity that Captain Langford involuntarily gave him credit for the discovery of some deep secret.

“You appear to be smitten, after all, with the charms of this queenly maiden,”said he, hoping thus to draw forth the physician's hidden knowledge.

“God forbid!”answered Dr. Clarke, with a grave smile;“and if you be wise you will put up the same prayer for yourself. Woe to those who shall be smitten by this beautiful Lady Eleanore! But yonder stands the Governor—and I have a word or two for his private ear. Good night!”

He accordingly advanced to Governor Shute, and addressed him in so low a tone that none of the by-standers could catch a word of what he said, although the sudden change of His Excellency's hitherto cheerful visage betokened that the communication could be of no agreeable import. A very few moments afterwards it was announced to the guests that an unforeseen circumstance rendered it necessary to put a premature close to the festival.

The ball at the Province House supplied a topic of conversation for the colonial metropolis for some days after its occurrence, and might still longer have been the general theme, only that a subject of all-engrossing interest thrust it, for a time, from the public recollection. This was the appearance of a dreadful epidemic, which, in that age and long before and afterward, was wont to slay its hundreds and thousands on both sides of the Atlantic. On the occasion of which we speak, it was distinguished by a peculiar virulence, insomuch that it has left its traces—its pit-marks, to use an appropriate figure—on the history of the country, the affairs of which were thrown into confusion by its ravages.

At first, unlike its ordinary course, the disease seemed to confine itself to the higher circles of society, selecting its victims from among the proud, the well-born, and the wealthy, entering unabashed into stately chambers, and lying down with the slumberers in silken beds. Some of the most distinguished guests of the Province House—even those whom the haughty Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe had deemed not unworthy of her favor—were stricken by this fatal scourge. It was noticed, with an ungenerous bitterness of feeling, that the four gentlemen—the Virginian, the British officer, the young clergyman, and the Governor's secretary—who had been her most devoted attendants on the evening of the ball, were the foremost on whom the plague stroke fell. But the disease, pursuing its onward progress, soon ceased to be exclusively a prerogative of aristocracy. Its red brand was no longer conferred like a noble's star, or an order of knighthood. It threaded its way through the narrow and crooked streets, and entered the low, mean, darksome dwellings, and laid its hand of death upon the artisans and laboring classes of the town. It compelled rich and poor to feel themselves brethren then; and stalking to and fro across the Three Hills, with a fierceness which made it almost a new pestilence, there was that mighty conqueror—that scourge and horror of our forefathers—the small-pox!

We cannot estimate the affright which this plague inspired of yore, by contemplating it as the fangless monster of the present day. We must remember, rather, with what awe we watched the gigantic footsteps of the Asiatic cholera, striding from shore to shore of the Atlantic, and marching like Destiny upon cities far remote which flight had already half depopulated. There is no other fear so horrible and unhumanizing as that which makes man dread to breathe heaven's vital air lest it be poison, or to grasp the hand of a brother or friend lest the grip of the pestilence should clutch him. Such was the dismay that now followed in the track of the disease, or ran before it throughout the town. Graves were hastily dug, and the pestilential relics as hastily covered, because the dead were enemies of the living, and strove to draw them headlong, as it were, into their own dismal pit. The public councils were suspended, as if mortal wisdom might relinquish its devices, now that an unearthly usurper had found his way into the ruler's mansion. Had an enemy's fleet been hovering on the coast, or his armies trampling on our soil, the people would probably have committed their defence to that same direful conqueror who had wrought their own calamity, and would permit no interference with his sway. This conqueror had a symbol of his triumphs. It was a blood-red flag, that fluttered in the tainted air, over the door of every dwelling into which the Small-Pox had entered.

Such a banner was long since waving over the portal of the Province House; for thence, as was proved by tracking its footsteps back, had all this dreadful mischief issued. It had been traced back to a lady's luxurious chamber—to the proudest of the proud—to her that was so delicate, and hardly owned herself of earthly mould—to the haughty one, who took her stand above human sympathies—to Lady Eleanore! There remained no room for doubt that the contagion had lurked in that gorgeous mantle, which threw so strange a grace around her at the festival. Its fantastic splendor had been conceived in the delirious brain of a woman on her death-bed, and was the last toil of her stiffening fingers, which had interwoven fate and misery with its golden threads.

This dark tale, whispered at first, was now bruited far and wide. The people raved against the Lady Eleanore, and cried out that her pride and scorn had evoked a fiend, and that, between them both, this monstrous evil had been born. At times, their rage and despair took the semblance of grinning mirth; and whenever the red flag of the pestilence was hoisted over another and yet another door, they clapped their hands and shouted through the streets, in bitter mockery:“Behold a new triumph for the Lady Eleanore!”

One day, in the midst of these dismal times, a wild figure approached the portal of the Province House, and folding his arms, stood contemplating the scarlet banner which a passing breeze shook fitfully, as if to fling abroad the contagion that it typified. At length, climbing one of the pillars by means of the iron balustrade, he took down the flag and entered the mansion, waving it above his head. At the foot of the staircase he met the Governor, booted and spurred, with his cloak drawn around him, evidently on the point of setting forth upon a journey.

“Wretched lunatic, what do you seek here?”exclaimed Shute, extending his cane to guard himself from contact.“There is nothing here but Death. Back or you will meet him!”

“Death will not touch me, the banner-bearer of the pestilence!”cried Jervase Helwyse, shaking the red flag aloft.“Death, and the Pestilence, who wears the aspect of the Lady Eleanore, will walk through the streets to-night, and I must march before them with this banner!”

“Why do I waste words on the fellow?”muttered the Governor, drawing his cloak across his mouth.“What matters his miserable life, when none of us are sure of twelve hours' breath? On, fool, to your own destruction!”

He made way for Jervase Helwyse, who immediately ascended the staircase, but on the first landing place, was arrested by the firm grasp of a hand upon his shoulder. Looking fiercely up, with a madman's impulse to struggle with and rend asunder his opponent, he found himself powerless beneath a calm, stern eye, which possessed the mysterious property of quelling frenzy at its height. The person whom he had now encountered was the physician, Dr. Clarke, the duties of whose sad profession had led him to the Province House, where he was an infrequent guest in more prosperous times.

“Young man, what is your purpose?”demanded he.

“I seek the Lady Eleanore,”answered Jervase Helwyse, submissively.

“All have fled from her,”said the physician.“Why do you seek her now? I tell you, youth, her nurse fell death-stricken on the threshold of that fatal chamber. Know ye not, that never came such a curse to our shores as this lovely Lady Eleanore?—that her breath has filled the air with poison?—that she has shaken pestilence and death upon the land, from the folds of her accursed mantle?”

“Let me look upon her!”rejoined the mad youth, more wildly.“Let me behold her, in her awful beauty, clad in the regal garments of the pestilence! She and Death sit on a throne together. Let me kneel down before them!”

“Poor youth!”said Dr. Clarke; and, moved by a deep sense of human weakness, a smile of caustic humor curled his lip even then.“Wilt thou still worship the destroyer and surround her image with fantasies the more magnificent, the more evil she has wrought? Thus man doth ever to his tyrants. Approach, then! Madness, as I have noted, has that good efficacy that it will guard you from contagion— and perchance its own cure may be found in yonder chamber.”

Ascending another flight of stairs, he threw open a door and signed to Jervase Helwyse that he should enter. The poor lunatic, it seems probable, had cherished a delusion that his haughty mistress sat in state, unharmed herself by the pestilential influence, which, as by enchantment, she scattered round about her. He dreamed, no doubt, that her beauty was not dimmed, but brightened into superhuman splendor. With such anticipations, he stole reverentially to the door at which the physician stood, but paused upon the threshold, gazing fearfully into the gloom of the darkened chamber.

“Where is the Lady Eleanore?”whispered he.

“Call her,”replied the physician.

“Lady Eleanore!—Princess!—Queen of Death!”cried Jervase Helwyse, advancing three steps into the chamber.“She is not here! There, on yonder table, I behold the sparkle of a diamond which once she wore upon her bosom. There”—and he shuddered—“there hangs her mantle, on which a dead woman embroidered a spell of dreadful potency. But where is the Lady Eleanore?”

Something stirred within the silken curtains of a canopied bed; and a low moan was uttered, which, listening intently, Jervase Helwyse began to distinguish as a woman's voice, complaining dolefully of thirst. He fancied, even, that he recognized its tones.

“My throat!—my throat is scorched,”murmured the voice.“A drop of water!”

“What thing art thou?”said the brain-stricken youth, drawing near the bed and tearing asunder its curtains.“Whose voice hast thou stolen for thy murmurs and miserable petitions, as if Lady Eleanore could be conscious of mortal infirmity? Fie! Heap of diseased mortality, why lurkest thou in my lady's chamber?”

“Oh, Jervase Helwyse,”said the voice—and as it spoke the figure contorted itself, struggling to hide its blasted face—“look not now on the woman you once loved! The curse of Heaven hath stricken me, because I would not call man my brother, nor woman sister. I wrapped myself in pride as in a mantle, and scorned the sympathies of nature; and therefore has Nature made this wretched body the medium of a dreadful sympathy. You are avenged—they are all avenged—Nature is avenged—for I am Eleanore Rochcliffe!”

The malice of his mental disease, the bitterness lurking at the bottom of his heart, mad as he was, for a blighted and ruined life, and love that had been paid with cruel scorn, awoke within the breast of Jervase Helwyse. He shook his finger at the wretched girl, and the chamber echoed, the curtains of the bed were shaken, with his outburst of insane merriment.

“Another triumph for the Lady Eleanore!”he cried.“All have been her victims! who so worthy to be the final victim as herself?”

Impelled by some new fantasy of his crazed intellect, he snatched the fatal mantle and rushed from the chamber and the house. That night a procession passed, by torchlight, through the streets, bearing in the midst the figure of a woman, enveloped with a richly embroidered mantle; while in advance stalked Jervase Helwyse, waving the red flag of the pestilence. Arriving opposite the Province House, the mob burned the effigy, and a strong wind came and swept away the ashes. It was said that, from that very hour, the pestilence abated, as if its sway had some mysterious connection, from the first plague-stroke to the last, with Lady Eleanore's Mantle. A remarkable uncertainty broods over that unhappy lady's fate. There is a belief, however, that in a certain chamber of this mansion a female form may sometimes be duskily discerned, shrinking into the darkest corner and muffling her face within an embroidered mantle. Supposing the legend true, can this be other than the once proud Lady Eleanore?





YOUNG GOODMAN BROWN


Young Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem village; but put his head back, after crossing the threshold, to exchange a parting kiss with his young wife. And Faith, as the wife was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown.

“Dearest heart,”whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lips were close to his ear,“prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to-night. A lone woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that she's afeard of herself sometimes. Pray tarry with me this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year.”

“My love and my Faith,”replied young Goodman Brown,“of all nights in the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee. My journey, as thou callest it, forth and back again, must needs be done 'twixt now and sunrise. What, my sweet, pretty wife, dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?”

“Then God bless you!”said Faith, with the pink ribbons;“and may you find all well when you come back.”

“Amen!”cried Goodman Brown.“Say thy prayers, dear Faith, and go to bed at dusk, and no harm will come to thee.”

So they parted; and the young man pursued his way until, being about to turn the corner by the meeting-house, he looked back and saw the head of Faith still peeping after him with a melancholy air, in spite of her pink ribbons.

“Poor little Faith!”thought he, for his heart smote him.“What a wretch am I to leave her on such an errand! She talks of dreams, too. Methought as she spoke there was trouble in her face, as if a dream had warned her what work is to be done tonight. But no, no; 't would kill her to think it. Well, she's a blessed angel on earth; and after this one night I'll cling to her skirts and follow her to heaven.”

With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown felt himself justified in making more haste on his present evil purpose. He had taken a dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest, which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep through, and closed immediately behind. It was all as lonely as could be; and there is this peculiarity in such a solitude, that the traveller knows not who may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughs overhead; so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen multitude.

“There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree,”said Goodman Brown to himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added,“What if the devil himself should be at my very elbow!”

His head being turned back, he passed a crook of the road, and, looking forward again, beheld the figure of a man, in grave and decent attire, seated at the foot of an old tree. He arose at Goodman Brown's approach and walked onward side by side with him.

“You are late, Goodman Brown,”said he.“The clock of the Old South was striking as I came through Boston, and that is full fifteen minutes agone.”

“Faith kept me back a while,”replied the young man, with a tremor in his voice, caused by the sudden appearance of his companion, though not wholly unexpected.

It was now deep dusk in the forest, and deepest in that part of it where these two were journeying. As nearly as could be discerned, the second traveller was about fifty years old, apparently in the same rank of life as Goodman Brown, and bearing a considerable resemblance to him, though perhaps more in expression than features. Still they might have been taken for father and son. And yet, though the elder person was as simply clad as the younger, and as simple in manner too, he had an indescribable air of one who knew the world, and who would not have felt abashed at the governor's dinner table or in King William's court, were it possible that his affairs should call him thither. But the only thing about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff, which bore the likeness of a great black snake, so curiously wrought that it might almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself like a living serpent. This, of course, must have been an ocular deception, assisted by the uncertain light.

“Come, Goodman Brown,”cried his fellow-traveller,“this is a dull pace for the beginning of a journey. Take my staff, if you are so soon weary.”

“Friend,”said the other, exchanging his slow pace for a full stop,“having kept covenant by meeting thee here, it is my purpose now to return whence I came. I have scruples touching the matter thou wot'st of.”

“Sayest thou so?”replied he of the serpent, smiling apart.“Let us walk on, nevertheless, reasoning as we go; and if I convince thee not thou shalt turn back. We are but a little way in the forest yet.”

“Too far! too far!”exclaimed the goodman, unconsciously resuming his walk.“My father never went into the woods on such an errand, nor his father before him. We have been a race of honest men and good Christians since the days of the martyrs; and shall I be the first of the name of Brown that ever took this path and kept—”

“Such company, thou wouldst say,”observed the elder person, interpreting his pause.“Well said, Goodman Brown! I have been as well acquainted with your family as with ever a one among the Puritans; and that's no trifle to say. I helped your grandfather, the constable, when he lashed the Quaker woman so smartly through the streets of Salem; and it was I that brought your father a pitch-pine knot, kindled at my own hearth, to set fire to an Indian village, in King Philip's war. They were my good friends, both; and many a pleasant walk have we had along this path, and returned merrily after midnight. I would fain be friends with you for their sake.”

“If it be as thou sayest,”replied Goodman Brown,“I marvel they never spoke of these matters; or, verily, I marvel not, seeing that the least rumor of the sort would have driven them from New England. We are a people of prayer, and good works to boot, and abide no such wickedness.”

“Wickedness or not,”said the traveller with the twisted staff,“I have a very general acquaintance here in New England. The deacons of many a church have drunk the communion wine with me; the selectmen of divers towns make me their chairman; and a majority of the Great and General Court are firm supporters of my interest. The governor and I, too—But these are state secrets.”

“Can this be so?”cried Goodman Brown, with a stare of amazement at his undisturbed companion.“Howbeit, I have nothing to do with the governor and council; they have their own ways, and are no rule for a simple husbandman like me. But, were I to go on with thee, how should I meet the eye of that good old man, our minister, at Salem village? Oh, his voice would make me tremble both Sabbath day and lecture day.”

Thus far the elder traveller had listened with due gravity; but now burst into a fit of irrepressible mirth, shaking himself so violently that his snake-like staff actually seemed to wriggle in sympathy.

“Ha! ha! ha!”shouted he again and again; then composing himself,“Well, go on, Goodman Brown, go on; but, prithee, don't kill me with laughing.”

“Well, then, to end the matter at once,”said Goodman Brown, considerably nettled,“there is my wife, Faith. It would break her dear little heart; and I'd rather break my own.”

“Nay, if that be the case,”answered the other,“e'en go thy ways, Goodman Brown. I would not for twenty old women like the one hobbling before us that Faith should come to any harm.”

As he spoke he pointed his staff at a female figure on the path, in whom Goodman Brown recognized a very pious and exemplary dame, who had taught him his catechism in youth, and was still his moral and spiritual adviser, jointly with the minister and Deacon Gookin.

“A marvel, truly, that Goody Cloyse should be so far in the wilderness at nightfall,”said he.“But with your leave, friend, I shall take a cut through the woods until we have left this Christian woman behind. Being a stranger to you, she might ask whom I was consorting with and whither I was going.”

“Be it so,”said his fellow-traveller.“Betake you to the woods, and let me keep the path.”

Accordingly the young man turned aside, but took care to watch his companion, who advanced softly along the road until he had come within a staff's length of the old dame. She, meanwhile, was making the best of her way, with singular speed for so aged a woman, and mumbling some indistinct words—a prayer, doubtless—as she went. The traveller put forth his staff and touched her withered neck with what seemed the serpent's tail.

“The devil!”screamed the pious old lady.

“Then Goody Cloyse knows her old friend?”observed the traveller, confronting her and leaning on his writhing stick.

“Ah, forsooth, and is it your worship indeed?”cried the good dame.“Yea, truly is it, and in the very image of my old gossip, Goodman Brown, the grandfather of the silly fellow that now is. But—would your worship believe it?—my broomstick hath strangely disappeared, stolen, as I suspect, by that unhanged witch, Goody Cory, and that, too, when I was all anointed with the juice of smallage, and cinquefoil, and wolf's bane—”

“Mingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe,”said the shape of old Goodman Brown.

“Ah, your worship knows the recipe,”cried the old lady, cackling aloud.“So, as I was saying, being all ready for the meeting, and no horse to ride on, I made up my mind to foot it; for they tell me there is a nice young man to be taken into communion to-night. But now your good worship will lend me your arm, and we shall be there in a twinkling.”

“That can hardly be,”answered her friend.“I may not spare you my arm, Goody Cloyse; but here is my staff, if you will.”

So saying, he threw it down at her feet, where, perhaps, it assumed life, being one of the rods which its owner had formerly lent to the Egyptian magi. Of this fact, however, Goodman Brown could not take cognizance. He had cast up his eyes in astonishment, and, looking down again, beheld neither Goody Cloyse nor the serpentine staff, but his fellow-traveller alone, who waited for him as calmly as if nothing had happened.

“That old woman taught me my catechism,”said the young man; and there was a world of meaning in this simple comment.

They continued to walk onward, while the elder traveller exhorted his companion to make good speed and persevere in the path, discoursing so aptly that his arguments seemed rather to spring up in the bosom of his auditor than to be suggested by himself. As they went, he plucked a branch of maple to serve for a walking stick, and began to strip it of the twigs and little boughs, which were wet with evening dew. The moment his fingers touched them they became strangely withered and dried up as with a week's sunshine. Thus the pair proceeded, at a good free pace, until suddenly, in a gloomy hollow of the road, Goodman Brown sat himself down on the stump of a tree and refused to go any farther.

“Friend,”said he, stubbornly,“my mind is made up. Not another step will I budge on this errand. What if a wretched old woman do choose to go to the devil when I thought she was going to heaven: is that any reason why I should quit my dear Faith and go after her?”

“You will think better of this by and by,”said his acquaintance, composedly.“Sit here and rest yourself a while; and when you feel like moving again, there is my staff to help you along.”

Without more words, he threw his companion the maple stick, and was as speedily out of sight as if he had vanished into the deepening gloom. The young man sat a few moments by the roadside, applauding himself greatly, and thinking with how clear a conscience he should meet the minister in his morning walk, nor shrink from the eye of good old Deacon Gookin. And what calm sleep would be his that very night, which was to have been spent so wickedly, but so purely and sweetly now, in the arms of Faith! Amidst these pleasant and praiseworthy meditations, Goodman Brown heard the tramp of horses along the road, and deemed it advisable to conceal himself within the verge of the forest, conscious of the guilty purpose that had brought him thither, though now so happily turned from it.

On came the hoof tramps and the voices of the riders, two grave old voices, conversing soberly as they drew near. These mingled sounds appeared to pass along the road, within a few yards of the young man's hiding-place; but, owing doubtless to the depth of the gloom at that particular spot, neither the travellers nor their steeds were visible. Though their figures brushed the small boughs by the wayside, it could not be seen that they intercepted, even for a moment, the faint gleam from the strip of bright sky athwart which they must have passed. Goodman Brown alternately crouched and stood on tiptoe, pulling aside the branches and thrusting forth his head as far as he durst without discerning so much as a shadow. It vexed him the more, because he could have sworn, were such a thing possible, that he recognized the voices of the minister and Deacon Gookin, jogging along quietly, as they were wont to do, when bound to some ordination or ecclesiastical council. While yet within hearing, one of the riders stopped to pluck a switch.

“Of the two, reverend sir,”said the voice like the deacon's,“I had rather miss an ordination dinner than to-night's meeting. They tell me that some of our community are to be here from Falmouth and beyond, and others from Connecticut and Rhode Island, besides several of the Indian powwows, who, after their fashion, know almost as much deviltry as the best of us. Moreover, there is a goodly young woman to be taken into communion.”

“Mighty well, Deacon Gookin!”replied the solemn old tones of the minister.“Spur up, or we shall be late. Nothing can be done, you know, until I get on the ground.”

The hoofs clattered again; and the voices, talking so strangely in the empty air, passed on through the forest, where no church had ever been gathered or solitary Christian prayed. Whither, then, could these holy men be journeying so deep into the heathen wilderness? Young Goodman Brown caught hold of a tree for support, being ready to sink down on the ground, faint and overburdened with the heavy sickness of his heart. He looked up to the sky, doubting whether there really was a heaven above him. Yet there was the blue arch, and the stars brightening in it.

“With heaven above and Faith below, I will yet stand firm against the devil!”cried Goodman Brown.

While he still gazed upward into the deep arch of the firmament and had lifted his hands to pray, a cloud, though no wind was stirring, hurried across the zenith and hid the brightening stars. The blue sky was still visible, except directly overhead, where this black mass of cloud was sweeping swiftly northward. Aloft in the air, as if from the depths of the cloud, came a confused and doubtful sound of voices. Once the listener fancied that he could distinguish the accents of towns-people of his own, men and women, both pious and ungodly, many of whom he had met at the communion table, and had seen others rioting at the tavern. The next moment, so indistinct were the sounds, he doubted whether he had heard aught but the murmur of the old forest, whispering without a wind. Then came a stronger swell of those familiar tones, heard daily in the sunshine at Salem village, but never until now from a cloud of night. There was one voice, of a young woman, uttering lamentations, yet with an uncertain sorrow, and entreating for some favor, which, perhaps, it would grieve her to obtain; and all the unseen multitude, both saints and sinners, seemed to encourage her onward.

“Faith!”shouted Goodman Brown, in a voice of agony and desperation; and the echoes of the forest mocked him, crying,“Faith! Faith!”as if bewildered wretches were seeking her all through the wilderness.

The cry of grief, rage, and terror was yet piercing the night, when the unhappy husband held his breath for a response. There was a scream, drowned immediately in a louder murmur of voices, fading into far-off laughter, as the dark cloud swept away, leaving the clear and silent sky above Goodman Brown. But something fluttered lightly down through the air and caught on the branch of a tree. The young man seized it, and beheld a pink ribbon.

“My Faith is gone!”cried he, after one stupefied moment.“There is no good on earth; and sin is but a name. Come, devil; for to thee is this world given.”

And, maddened with despair, so that he laughed loud and long, did Goodman Brown grasp his staff and set forth again, at such a rate that he seemed to fly along the forest path rather than to walk or run. The road grew wilder and drearier and more faintly traced, and vanished at length, leaving him in the heart of the dark wilderness, still rushing onward with the instinct that guides mortal man to evil. The whole forest was peopled with frightful sounds—the creaking of the trees, the howling of wild beasts, and the yell of Indians; while sometimes the wind tolled like a distant church bell, and sometimes gave a broad roar around the traveller, as if all Nature were laughing him to scorn. But he was himself the chief horror of the scene, and shrank not from its other horrors.

“Ha! ha! ha!”roared Goodman Brown when the wind laughed at him.“Let us hear which will laugh loudest. Think not to frighten me with your deviltry. Come witch, come wizard, come Indian powwow, come devil himself, and here comes Goodman Brown. You may as well fear him as he fear you.”

In truth, all through the haunted forest there could be nothing more frightful than the figure of Goodman Brown. On he flew among the black pines, brandishing his staff with frenzied gestures, now giving vent to an inspiration of horrid blasphemy, and now shouting forth such laughter as set all the echoes of the forest laughing like demons around him. The fiend in his own shape is less hideous than when he rages in the breast of man. Thus sped the demoniac on his course, until, quivering among the trees, he saw a red light before him, as when the felled trunks and branches of a clearing have been set on fire, and throw up their lurid blaze against the sky, at the hour of midnight. He paused, in a lull of the tempest that had driven him onward, and heard the swell of what seemed a hymn, rolling solemnly from a distance with the weight of many voices. He knew the tune; it was a familiar one in the choir of the village meeting-house. The verse died heavily away, and was lengthened by a chorus, not of human voices, but of all the sounds of the benighted wilderness pealing in awful harmony together. Goodman Brown cried out, and his cry was lost to his own ear by its unison with the cry of the desert.

In the interval of silence he stole forward until the light glared full upon his eyes. At one extremity of an open space, hemmed in by the dark wall of the forest, arose a rock, bearing some rude, natural resemblance either to an altar or a pulpit, and surrounded by four blazing pines, their tops aflame, their stems untouched, like candles at an evening meeting. The mass of foliage that had overgrown the summit of the rock was all on fire, blazing high into the night and fitfully illuminating the whole field. Each pendent twig and leafy festoon was in a blaze. As the red light arose and fell, a numerous congregation alternately shone forth, then disappeared in shadow, and again grew, as it were, out of the darkness, peopling the heart of the solitary woods at once.

“A grave and dark-clad company,”quoth Goodman Brown.

In truth they were such. Among them, quivering to and fro between gloom and splendor, appeared faces that would be seen next day at the council board of the province, and others which, Sabbath after Sabbath, looked devoutly heavenward, and benignantly over the crowded pews, from the holiest pulpits in the land. Some affirm that the lady of the governor was there. At least there were high dames well known to her, and wives of honored husbands, and widows, a great multitude, and ancient maidens, all of excellent repute, and fair young girls, who trembled lest their mothers should espy them. Either the sudden gleams of light flashing over the obscure field bedazzled Goodman Brown, or he recognized a score of the church members of Salem village famous for their especial sanctity. Good old Deacon Gookin had arrived, and waited at the skirts of that venerable saint, his revered pastor. But, irreverently consorting with these grave, reputable, and pious people, these elders of the church, these chaste dames and dewy virgins, there were men of dissolute lives and women of spotted fame, wretches given over to all mean and filthy vice, and suspected even of horrid crimes. It was strange to see that the good shrank not from the wicked, nor were the sinners abashed by the saints. Scattered also among their pale-faced enemies were the Indian priests, or powwows, who had often scared their native forest with more hideous incantations than any known to English witchcraft.

“But where is Faith?”thought Goodman Brown; and, as hope came into his heart, he trembled.

Another verse of the hymn arose, a slow and mournful strain, such as the pious love, but joined to words which expressed all that our nature can conceive of sin, and darkly hinted at far more. Unfathomable to mere mortals is the lore of fiends. Verse after verse was sung; and still the chorus of the desert swelled between like the deepest tone of a mighty organ; and with the final peal of that dreadful anthem there came a sound, as if the roaring wind, the rushing streams, the howling beasts, and every other voice of the unconcerted wilderness were mingling and according with the voice of guilty man in homage to the prince of all. The four blazing pines threw up a loftier flame, and obscurely discovered shapes and visages of horror on the smoke wreaths above the impious assembly. At the same moment the fire on the rock shot redly forth and formed a glowing arch above its base, where now appeared a figure. With reverence be it spoken, the figure bore no slight similitude, both in garb and manner, to some grave divine of the New England churches.

“Bring forth the converts!”cried a voice that echoed through the field and rolled into the forest.

At the word, Goodman Brown stepped forth from the shadow of the trees and approached the congregation, with whom he felt a loathful brotherhood by the sympathy of all that was wicked in his heart. He could have well-nigh sworn that the shape of his own dead father beckoned him to advance, looking downward from a smoke wreath, while a woman, with dim features of despair, threw out her hand to warn him back. Was it his mother? But he had no power to retreat one step, nor to resist, even in thought, when the minister and good old Deacon Gookin seized his arms and led him to the blazing rock. Thither came also the slender form of a veiled female, led between Goody Cloyse, that pious teacher of the catechism, and Martha Carrier, who had received the devil's promise to be queen of hell. A rampant hag was she. And there stood the proselytes beneath the canopy of fire.

“Welcome, my children,”said the dark figure,“to the communion of your race. Ye have found thus young your nature and your destiny. My children, look behind you!”

They turned; and flashing forth, as it were, in a sheet of flame, the fiend worshippers were seen; the smile of welcome gleamed darkly on every visage.

“There,”resumed the sable form,“are all whom ye have reverenced from youth. Ye deemed them holier than yourselves, and shrank from your own sin, contrasting it with their lives of righteousness and prayerful aspirations heavenward. Yet here are they all in my worshipping assembly. This night it shall be granted you to know their secret deeds: how hoary-bearded elders of the church have whispered wanton words to the young maids of their households; how many a woman, eager for widows' weeds, has given her husband a drink at bedtime and let him sleep his last sleep in her bosom; how beardless youths have made haste to inherit their fathers' wealth; and how fair damsels—blush not, sweet ones—have dug little graves in the garden, and bidden me, the sole guest, to an infant's funeral. By the sympathy of your human hearts for sin ye shall scent out all the places—whether in church, bed-chamber, street, field, or forest—where crime has been committed, and shall exult to behold the whole earth one stain of guilt, one mighty blood spot. Far more than this. It shall be yours to penetrate, in every bosom, the deep mystery of sin, the fountain of all wicked arts, and which inexhaustibly supplies more evil impulses than human power—than my power at its utmost—can make manifest in deeds. And now, my children, look upon each other.”

They did so; and, by the blaze of the hell-kindled torches, the wretched man beheld his Faith, and the wife her husband, trembling before that unhallowed altar.

“Lo, there ye stand, my children,”said the figure, in a deep and solemn tone, almost sad with its despairing awfulness, as if his once angelic nature could yet mourn for our miserable race.“Depending upon one another's hearts, ye had still hoped that virtue were not all a dream. Now are ye undeceived. Evil is the nature of mankind. Evil must be your only happiness. Welcome again, my children, to the communion of your race.”

“Welcome,”repeated the fiend worshippers, in one cry of despair and triumph.

And there they stood, the only pair, as it seemed, who were yet hesitating on the verge of wickedness in this dark world. A basin was hollowed, naturally, in the rock. Did it contain water, reddened by the lurid light? or was it blood? or, perchance, a liquid flame? Herein did the shape of evil dip his hand and prepare to lay the mark of baptism upon their foreheads, that they might be partakers of the mystery of sin, more conscious of the secret guilt of others, both in deed and thought, than they could now be of their own. The husband cast one look at his pale wife, and Faith at him. What polluted wretches would the next glance show them to each other, shuddering alike at what they disclosed and what they saw!

“Faith! Faith!”cried the husband,“look up to heaven, and resist the wicked one.”

Whether Faith obeyed he knew not. Hardly had he spoken when he found himself amid calm night and solitude, listening to a roar of the wind which died heavily away through the forest. He staggered against the rock, and felt it chill and damp; while a hanging twig, that had been all on fire, besprinkled his cheek with the coldest dew.

The next morning young Goodman Brown came slowly into the street of Salem village, staring around him like a bewildered man. The good old minister was taking a walk along the graveyard to get an appetite for breakfast and meditate his sermon, and bestowed a blessing, as he passed, on Goodman Brown. He shrank from the venerable saint as if to avoid an anathema. Old Deacon Gookin was at domestic worship, and the holy words of his prayer were heard through the open window.“What God doth the wizard pray to?”quoth Goodman Brown. Goody Cloyse, that excellent old Christian, stood in the early sunshine at her own lattice, catechizing a little girl who had brought her a pint of morning's milk. Goodman Brown snatched away the child as from the grasp of the fiend himself. Turning the corner by the meeting-house, he spied the head of Faith, with the pink ribbons, gazing anxiously forth, and bursting into such joy at sight of him that she skipped along the street and almost kissed her husband before the whole village. But Goodman Brown looked sternly and sadly into her face, and passed on without a greeting.

Had Goodman Brown fallen asleep in the forest and only dreamed a wild dream of a witch-meeting?

Be it so if you will; but, alas! it was a dream of evil omen for young Goodman Brown. A stern, a sad, a darkly meditative, a distrustful, if not a desperate man did he become from the night of that fearful dream. On the Sabbath day, when the congregation were singing a holy psalm, he could not listen because an anthem of sin rushed loudly upon his ear and drowned all the blessed strain. When the minister spoke from the pulpit with power and fervid eloquence, and, with his hand on the open Bible, of the sacred truths of our religion, and of saint-like lives and triumphant deaths, and of future bliss or misery unutterable, then did Goodman Brown turn pale, dreading lest the roof should thunder down upon the gray blasphemer and his hearers. Often, a waking suddenly at midnight, he shrank from the bosom of Faith; and at morning or eventide, when the family knelt down at prayer, he scowled and muttered to himself, and gazed sternly at his wife, and turned away. And when he had lived long, and was borne to his grave a hoary corpse, followed by Faith, an aged woman, and children and grandchildren, a goodly procession, besides neighbors not a few, they carved no hopeful verse upon his tombstone, for his dying hour was gloom.





ROGER MALVIN'S BURIAL


One of the few incidents of Indian warfare naturally susceptible of the moonlight of romance was that expedition undertaken for the defence of the frontiers in the year 1725, which resulted in the well-remembered“Lovell's Fight.”Imagination, by casting certain circumstances judicially into the shade, may see much to admire in the heroism of a little band who gave battle to twice their number in the heart of the enemy's country. The open bravery displayed by both parties was in accordance with civilized ideas of valor; and chivalry itself might not blush to record the deeds of one or two individuals. The battle, though so fatal to those who fought, was not unfortunate in its consequences to the country; for it broke the strength of a tribe and conduced to the peace which subsisted during several ensuing years. History and tradition are unusually minute in their memorials of their affair; and the captain of a scouting party of frontier men has acquired as actual a military renown as many a victorious leader of thousands. Some of the incidents contained in the following pages will be recognized, notwithstanding the substitution of fictitious names, by such as have heard, from old men's lips, the fate of the few combatants who were in a condition to retreat after“Lovell's Fight.”

The early sunbeams hovered cheerfully upon the tree-tops, beneath which two weary and wounded men had stretched their limbs the night before. Their bed of withered oak leaves was strewn upon the small level space, at the foot of a rock, situated near the summit of one of the gentle swells by which the face of the country is there diversified. The mass of granite, rearing its smooth, flat surface fifteen or twenty feet above their heads, was not unlike a gigantic gravestone, upon which the veins seemed to form an inscription in forgotten characters. On a tract of several acres around this rock, oaks and other hard-wood trees had supplied the place of the pines, which were the usual growth of the land; and a young and vigorous sapling stood close beside the travellers.

The severe wound of the elder man had probably deprived him of sleep; for, so soon as the first ray of sunshine rested on the top of the highest tree, he reared himself painfully from his recumbent posture and sat erect. The deep lines of his countenance and the scattered gray of his hair marked him as past the middle age; but his muscular frame would, but for the effect of his wound, have been as capable of sustaining fatigue as in the early vigor of life. Languor and exhaustion now sat upon his haggard features; and the despairing glance which he sent forward through the depths of the forest proved his own conviction that his pilgrimage was at an end. He next turned his eyes to the companion who reclined by his side. The youth—for he had scarcely attained the years of manhood—lay, with his head upon his arm, in the embrace of an unquiet sleep, which a thrill of pain from his wounds seemed each moment on the point of breaking. His right hand grasped a musket; and, to judge from the violent action of his features, his slumbers were bringing back a vision of the conflict of which he was one of the few survivors. A shout deep and loud in his dreaming fancy—found its way in an imperfect murmur to his lips; and, starting even at the slight sound of his own voice, he suddenly awoke. The first act of reviving recollection was to make anxious inquiries respecting the condition of his wounded fellow-traveller. The latter shook his head.

“Reuben, my boy,”said he,“this rock beneath which we sit will serve for an old hunter's gravestone. There is many and many a long mile of howling wilderness before us yet; nor would it avail me anything if the smoke of my own chimney were but on the other side of that swell of land. The Indian bullet was deadlier than I thought.”

“You are weary with our three days' travel,”replied the youth,“and a little longer rest will recruit you. Sit you here while I search the woods for the herbs and roots that must be our sustenance; and, having eaten, you shall lean on me, and we will turn our faces homeward. I doubt not that, with my help, you can attain to some one of the frontier garrisons.”

“There is not two days' life in me, Reuben,”said the other, calmly,“and I will no longer burden you with my useless body, when you can scarcely support your own. Your wounds are deep and your strength is failing fast; yet, if you hasten onward alone, you may be preserved. For me there is no hope, and I will await death here.”

“If it must be so, I will remain and watch by you,”said Reuben, resolutely.

“No, my son, no,”rejoined his companion.“Let the wish of a dying man have weight with you; give me one grasp of your hand, and get you hence. Think you that my last moments will be eased by the thought that I leave you to die a more lingering death? I have loved you like a father, Reuben; and at a time like this I should have something of a father's authority. I charge you to be gone that I may die in peace.”

“And because you have been a father to me, should I therefore leave you to perish and to lie unburied in the wilderness?”exclaimed the youth.“No; if your end be in truth approaching, I will watch by you and receive your parting words. I will dig a grave here by the rock, in which, if my weakness overcome me, we will rest together; or, if Heaven gives me strength, I will seek my way home.”

“In the cities and wherever men dwell,”replied the other,“they bury their dead in the earth; they hide them from the sight of the living; but here, where no step may pass perhaps for a hundred years, wherefore should I not rest beneath the open sky, covered only by the oak leaves when the autumn winds shall strew them? And for a monument, here is this gray rock, on which my dying hand shall carve the name of Roger Malvin, and the traveller in days to come will know that here sleeps a hunter and a warrior. Tarry not, then, for a folly like this, but hasten away, if not for your own sake, for hers who will else be desolate.”

Malvin spoke the last few words in a faltering voice, and their effect upon his companion was strongly visible. They reminded him that there were other and less questionable duties than that of sharing the fate of a man whom his death could not benefit. Nor can it be affirmed that no selfish feeling strove to enter Reuben's heart, though the consciousness made him more earnestly resist his companion's entreaties.

“How terrible to wait the slow approach of death in this solitude!”exclaimed he.“A brave man does not shrink in the battle; and, when friends stand round the bed, even women may die composedly; but here—”

“I shall not shrink even here, Reuben Bourne,”interrupted Malvin.“I am a man of no weak heart, and, if I were, there is a surer support than that of earthly friends. You are young, and life is dear to you. Your last moments will need comfort far more than mine; and when you have laid me in the earth, and are alone, and night is settling on the forest, you will feel all the bitterness of the death that may now be escaped. But I will urge no selfish motive to your generous nature. Leave me for my sake, that, having said a prayer for your safety, I may have space to settle my account undisturbed by worldly sorrows.”

“And your daughter,—how shall I dare to meet her eye?”exclaimed Reuben.“She will ask the fate of her father, whose life I vowed to defend with my own. Must I tell her that he travelled three days' march with me from the field of battle and that then I left him to perish in the wilderness? Were it not better to lie down and die by your side than to return safe and say this to Dorcas?”

“Tell my daughter,”said Roger Malvin,“that, though yourself sore wounded, and weak, and weary, you led my tottering footsteps many a mile, and left me only at my earnest entreaty, because I would not have your blood upon my soul. Tell her that through pain and danger you were faithful, and that, if your lifeblood could have saved me, it would have flowed to its last drop; and tell her that you will be something dearer than a father, and that my blessing is with you both, and that my dying eyes can see a long and pleasant path in which you will journey together.”

As Malvin spoke he almost raised himself from the ground, and the energy of his concluding words seemed to fill the wild and lonely forest with a vision of happiness; but, when he sank exhausted upon his bed of oak leaves, the light which had kindled in Reuben's eye was quenched. He felt as if it were both sin and folly to think of happiness at such a moment. His companion watched his changing countenance, and sought with generous art to wile him to his own good.

“Perhaps I deceive myself in regard to the time I have to live,”he resumed.“It may be that, with speedy assistance, I might recover of my wound. The foremost fugitives must, ere this, have carried tidings of our fatal battle to the frontiers, and parties will be out to succor those in like condition with ourselves. Should you meet one of these and guide them hither, who can tell but that I may sit by my own fireside again?”

A mournful smile strayed across the features of the dying man as he insinuated that unfounded hope,—which, however, was not without its effect on Reuben. No merely selfish motive, nor even the desolate condition of Dorcas, could have induced him to desert his companion at such a moment—but his wishes seized on the thought that Malvin's life might be preserved, and his sanguine nature heightened almost to certainty the remote possibility of procuring human aid.

“Surely there is reason, weighty reason, to hope that friends are not far distant,”he said, half aloud.“There fled one coward, unwounded, in the beginning of the fight, and most probably he made good speed. Every true man on the frontier would shoulder his musket at the news; and, though no party may range so far into the woods as this, I shall perhaps encounter them in one day's march. Counsel me faithfully,”he added, turning to Malvin, in distrust of his own motives.“Were your situation mine, would you desert me while life remained?”

“It is now twenty years,”replied Roger Malvin,—sighing, however, as he secretly acknowledged the wide dissimilarity between the two cases,—“it is now twenty years since I escaped with one dear friend from Indian captivity near Montreal. We journeyed many days through the woods, till at length overcome with hunger and weariness, my friend lay down and besought me to leave him; for he knew that, if I remained, we both must perish; and, with but little hope of obtaining succor, I heaped a pillow of dry leaves beneath his head and hastened on.”

“And did you return in time to save him?”asked Reuben, hanging on Malvin's words as if they were to be prophetic of his own success.

“I did,”answered the other.“I came upon the camp of a hunting party before sunset of the same day. I guided them to the spot where my comrade was expecting death; and he is now a hale and hearty man upon his own farm, far within the frontiers, while I lie wounded here in the depths of the wilderness.”

This example, powerful in affecting Reuben's decision, was aided, unconsciously to himself, by the hidden strength of many another motive. Roger Malvin perceived that the victory was nearly won.

“Now, go, my son, and Heaven prosper you!”he said.“Turn not back with your friends when you meet them, lest your wounds and weariness overcome you; but send hitherward two or three, that may be spared, to search for me; and believe me, Reuben, my heart will be lighter with every step you take towards home.”Yet there was, perhaps, a change both in his countenance and voice as he spoke thus; for, after all, it was a ghastly fate to be left expiring in the wilderness.

Reuben Bourne, but half convinced that he was acting rightly, at length raised himself from the ground and prepared himself for his departure. And first, though contrary to Malvin's wishes, he collected a stock of roots and herbs, which had been their only food during the last two days. This useless supply he placed within reach of the dying man, for whom, also, he swept together a bed of dry oak leaves. Then climbing to the summit of the rock, which on one side was rough and broken, he bent the oak sapling downward, and bound his handkerchief to the topmost branch. This precaution was not unnecessary to direct any who might come in search of Malvin; for every part of the rock, except its broad, smooth front, was concealed at a little distance by the dense undergrowth of the forest. The handkerchief had been the bandage of a wound upon Reuben's arm; and, as he bound it to the tree, he vowed by the blood that stained it that he would return, either to save his companion's life or to lay his body in the grave. He then descended, and stood, with downcast eyes, to receive Roger Malvin's parting words.

The experience of the latter suggested much and minute advice respecting the youth's journey through the trackless forest. Upon this subject he spoke with calm earnestness, as if he were sending Reuben to the battle or the chase while he himself remained secure at home, and not as if the human countenance that was about to leave him were the last he would ever behold. But his firmness was shaken before he concluded.

“Carry my blessing to Dorcas, and say that my last prayer shall be for her and you. Bid her to have no hard thoughts because you left me here,”—Reuben's heart smote him,—“for that your life would not have weighed with you if its sacrifice could have done me good. She will marry you after she has mourned a little while for her father; and Heaven grant you long and happy days, and may your children's children stand round your death bed! And, Reuben,”added he, as the weakness of mortality made its way at last,“return, when your wounds are healed and your weariness refreshed,—return to this wild rock, and lay my bones in the grave, and say a prayer over them.”

An almost superstitious regard, arising perhaps from the customs of the Indians, whose war was with the dead as well as the living, was paid by the frontier inhabitants to the rites of sepulture; and there are many instances of the sacrifice of life in the attempt to bury those who had fallen by the“sword of the wilderness.”Reuben, therefore, felt the full importance of the promise which he most solemnly made to return and perform Roger Malvin's obsequies. It was remarkable that the latter, speaking his whole heart in his parting words, no longer endeavored to persuade the youth that even the speediest succor might avail to the preservation of his life. Reuben was internally convinced that he should see Malvin's living face no more. His generous nature would fain have delayed him, at whatever risk, till the dying scene were past; but the desire of existence and the hope of happiness had strengthened in his heart, and he was unable to resist them.

“It is enough,”said Roger Malvin, having listened to Reuben's promise.“Go, and God speed you!”

The youth pressed his hand in silence, turned, and was departing. His slow and faltering steps, however, had borne him but a little way before Malvin's voice recalled him.

“Reuben, Reuben,”said he, faintly; and Reuben returned and knelt down by the dying man.

“Raise me, and let me lean against the rock,”was his last request.“My face will be turned towards home, and I shall see you a moment longer as you pass among the trees.”

Reuben, having made the desired alteration in his companion's posture, again began his solitary pilgrimage. He walked more hastily at first than was consistent with his strength; for a sort of guilty feeling, which sometimes torments men in their most justifiable acts, caused him to seek concealment from Malvin's eyes; but after he had trodden far upon the rustling forest leaves he crept back, impelled by a wild and painful curiosity, and, sheltered by the earthy roots of an uptorn tree, gazed earnestly at the desolate man. The morning sun was unclouded, and the trees and shrubs imbibed the sweet air of the month of May; yet there seemed a gloom on Nature's face, as if she sympathized with mortal pain and sorrow Roger Malvin's hands were uplifted in a fervent prayer, some of the words of which stole through the stillness of the woods and entered Reuben's heart, torturing it with an unutterable pang. They were the broken accents of a petition for his own happiness and that of Dorcas; and, as the youth listened, conscience, or something in its similitude, pleaded strongly with him to return and lie down again by the rock. He felt how hard was the doom of the kind and generous being whom he had deserted in his extremity. Death would come like the slow approach of a corpse, stealing gradually towards him through the forest, and showing its ghastly and motionless features from behind a nearer and yet a nearer tree. But such must have been Reuben's own fate had he tarried another sunset; and who shall impute blame to him if he shrink from so useless a sacrifice? As he gave a parting look, a breeze waved the little banner upon the sapling oak and reminded Reuben of his vow.

Many circumstances combined to retard the wounded traveller in his way to the frontiers. On the second day the clouds, gathering densely over the sky, precluded the possibility of regulating his course by the position of the sun; and he knew not but that every effort of his almost exhausted strength was removing him farther from the home he sought. His scanty sustenance was supplied by the berries and other spontaneous products of the forest. Herds of deer, it is true, sometimes bounded past him, and partridges frequently whirred up before his footsteps; but his ammunition had been expended in the fight, and he had no means of slaying them. His wounds, irritated by the constant exertion in which lay the only hope of life, wore away his strength and at intervals confused his reason. But, even in the wanderings of intellect, Reuben's young heart clung strongly to existence; and it was only through absolute incapacity of motion that he at last sank down beneath a tree, compelled there to await death.

In this situation he was discovered by a party who, upon the first intelligence of the fight, had been despatched to the relief of the survivors. They conveyed him to the nearest settlement, which chanced to be that of his own residence.

Dorcas, in the simplicity of the olden time, watched by the bedside of her wounded lover, and administered all those comforts that are in the sole gift of woman's heart and hand. During several days Reuben's recollection strayed drowsily among the perils and hardships through which he had passed, and he was incapable of returning definite answers to the inquiries with which many were eager to harass him. No authentic particulars of the battle had yet been circulated; nor could mothers, wives, and children tell whether their loved ones were detained by captivity or by the stronger chain of death. Dorcas nourished her apprehensions in silence till one afternoon when Reuben awoke from an unquiet sleep, and seemed to recognize her more perfectly than at any previous time. She saw that his intellect had become composed, and she could no longer restrain her filial anxiety.

“My father, Reuben?”she began; but the change in her lover's countenance made her pause.

The youth shrank as if with a bitter pain, and the blood gushed vividly into his wan and hollow cheeks. His first impulse was to cover his face; but, apparently with a desperate effort, he half raised himself and spoke vehemently, defending himself against an imaginary accusation.

“Your father was sore wounded in the battle, Dorcas; and he bade me not burden myself with him, but only to lead him to the lakeside, that he might quench his thirst and die. But I would not desert the old man in his extremity, and, though bleeding myself, I supported him; I gave him half my strength, and led him away with me. For three days we journeyed on together, and your father was sustained beyond my hopes, but, awaking at sunrise on the fourth day, I found him faint and exhausted; he was unable to proceed; his life had ebbed away fast; and—”

“He died!”exclaimed Dorcas, faintly.

Reuben felt it impossible to acknowledge that his selfish love of life had hurried him away before her father's fate was decided. He spoke not; he only bowed his head; and, between shame and exhaustion, sank back and hid his face in the pillow. Dorcas wept when her fears were thus confirmed; but the shock, as it had been long anticipated, was on that account the less violent.

“You dug a grave for my poor father in the wilderness, Reuben?”was the question by which her filial piety manifested itself.

“My hands were weak; but I did what I could,”replied the youth in a smothered tone.“There stands a noble tombstone above his head; and I would to Heaven I slept as soundly as he!”

Dorcas, perceiving the wildness of his latter words, inquired no further at the time; but her heart found ease in the thought that Roger Malvin had not lacked such funeral rites as it was possible to bestow. The tale of Reuben's courage and fidelity lost nothing when she communicated it to her friends; and the poor youth, tottering from his sick chamber to breathe the sunny air, experienced from every tongue the miserable and humiliating torture of unmerited praise. All acknowledged that he might worthily demand the hand of the fair maiden to whose father he had been“faithful unto death;”and, as my tale is not of love, it shall suffice to say that in the space of a few months Reuben became the husband of Dorcas Malvin. During the marriage ceremony the bride was covered with blushes, but the bridegroom's face was pale.

There was now in the breast of Reuben Bourne an incom-municable thought—something which he was to conceal most heedfully from her whom he most loved and trusted. He regretted, deeply and bitterly, the moral cowardice that had restrained his words when he was about to disclose the truth to Dorcas; but pride, the fear of losing her affection, the dread of universal scorn, forbade him to rectify this falsehood. He felt that for leaving Roger Malvin he deserved no censure. His presence, the gratuitous sacrifice of his own life, would have added only another and a needless agony to the last moments of the dying man; but concealment had imparted to a justifiable act much of the secret effect of guilt; and Reuben, while reason told him that he had done right, experienced in no small degree the mental horrors which punish the perpetrator of undiscovered crime. By a certain association of ideas, he at times almost imagined himself a murderer. For years, also, a thought would occasionally recur, which, though he perceived all its folly and extravagance, he had not power to banish from his mind. It was a haunting and torturing fancy that his father-in-law was yet sitting at the foot of the rock, on the withered forest leaves, alive, and awaiting his pledged assistance. These mental deceptions, however, came and went, nor did he ever mistake them for realities: but in the calmest and clearest moods of his mind he was conscious that he had a deep vow unredeemed, and that an unburied corpse was calling to him out of the wilderness. Yet such was the consequence of his prevarication that he could not obey the call. It was now too late to require the assistance of Roger Malvin's friends in performing his long-deferred sepulture; and superstitious fears, of which none were more susceptible than the people of the outward settlements, forbade Reuben to go alone. Neither did he know where in the pathless and illimitable forest to seek that smooth and lettered rock at the base of which the body lay: his remembrance of every portion of his travel thence was indistinct, and the latter part had left no impression upon his mind. There was, however, a continual impulse, a voice audible only to himself, commanding him to go forth and redeem his vow; and he had a strange impression that, were he to make the trial, he would be led straight to Malvin's bones. But year after year that summons, unheard but felt, was disobeyed. His one secret thought became like a chain binding down his spirit and like a serpent gnawing into his heart; and he was transformed into a sad and downcast yet irritable man.

In the course of a few years after their marriage changes began to be visible in the external prosperity of Reuben and Dorcas. The only riches of the former had been his stout heart and strong arm; but the latter, her father's sole heiress, had made her husband master of a farm, under older cultivation, larger, and better stocked than most of the frontier establishments. Reuben Bourne, however, was a neglectful husbandman; and, while the lands of the other settlers became annually more fruitful, his deteriorated in the same proportion. The discouragements to agriculture were greatly lessened by the cessation of Indian war, during which men held the plough in one hand and the musket in the other, and were fortunate if the products of their dangerous labor were not destroyed, either in the field or in the barn, by the savage enemy. But Reuben did not profit by the altered condition of the country; nor can it be denied that his intervals of industrious attention to his affairs were but scantily rewarded with success. The irritability by which he had recently become distinguished was another cause of his declining prosperity, as it occasioned frequent quarrels in his unavoidable intercourse with the neighboring settlers. The results of these were innumerable lawsuits; for the people of New England, in the earliest stages and wildest circumstances of the country, adopted, whenever attainable, the legal mode of deciding their differences. To be brief, the world did not go well with Reuben Bourne; and, though not till many years after his marriage, he was finally a ruined man, with but one remaining expedient against the evil fate that had pursued him. He was to throw sunlight into some deep recess of the forest, and seek subsistence from the virgin bosom of the wilderness.

The only child of Reuben and Dorcas was a son, now arrived at the age of fifteen years, beautiful in youth, and giving promise of a glorious manhood. He was peculiarly qualified for, and already began to excel in, the wild accomplishments of frontier life. His foot was fleet, his aim true, his apprehension quick, his heart glad and high; and all who anticipated the return of Indian war spoke of Cyrus Bourne as a future leader in the land. The boy was loved by his father with a deep and silent strength, as if whatever was good and happy in his own nature had been transferred to his child, carrying his affections with it. Even Dorcas, though loving and beloved, was far less dear to him; for Reuben's secret thoughts and insulated emotions had gradually made him a selfish man, and he could no longer love deeply except where he saw or imagined some reflection or likeness of his own mind. In Cyrus he recognized what he had himself been in other days; and at intervals he seemed to partake of the boy's spirit, and to be revived with a fresh and happy life. Reuben was accompanied by his son in the expedition, for the purpose of selecting a tract of land and felling and burning the timber, which necessarily preceded the removal of the household gods. Two months of autumn were thus occupied, after which Reuben Bourne and his young hunter returned to spend their last winter in the settlements.

It was early in the month of May that the little family snapped asunder whatever tendrils of affections had clung to inanimate objects, and bade farewell to the few who, in the blight of fortune, called themselves their friends. The sadness of the parting moment had, to each of the pilgrims, its peculiar alleviations. Reuben, a moody man, and misanthropic because unhappy, strode onward with his usual stern brow and downcast eye, feeling few regrets and disdaining to acknowledge any. Dorcas, while she wept abundantly over the broken ties by which her simple and affectionate nature had bound itself to everything, felt that the inhabitants of her inmost heart moved on with her, and that all else would be supplied wherever she might go. And the boy dashed one tear-drop from his eye, and thought of the adventurous pleasures of the untrodden forest.

Oh, who, in the enthusiasm of a daydream, has not wished that he were a wanderer in a world of summer wilderness, with one fair and gentle being hanging lightly on his arm? In youth his free and exulting step would know no barrier but the rolling ocean or the snow-topped mountains; calmer manhood would choose a home where Nature had strewn a double wealth in the vale of some transparent stream; and when hoary age, after long, long years of that pure life, stole on and found him there, it would find him the father of a race, the patriarch of a people, the founder of a mighty nation yet to be. When death, like the sweet sleep which we welcome after a day of happiness, came over him, his far descendants would mourn over the venerated dust. Enveloped by tradition in mysterious attributes, the men of future generations would call him godlike; and remote posterity would see him standing, dimly glorious, far up the valley of a hundred centuries.

The tangled and gloomy forest through which the personages of my tale were wandering differed widely from the dreamer's land of fantasy; yet there was something in their way of life that Nature asserted as her own, and the gnawing cares which went with them from the world were all that now obstructed their happiness. One stout and shaggy steed, the bearer of all their wealth, did not shrink from the added weight of Dorcas; although her hardy breeding sustained her, during the latter part of each day's journey, by her husband's side. Reuben and his son, their muskets on their shoulders and their axes slung behind them, kept an unwearied pace, each watching with a hunter's eye for the game that supplied their food. When hunger bade, they halted and prepared their meal on the bank of some unpolluted forest brook, which, as they knelt down with thirsty lips to drink, murmured a sweet unwillingness, like a maiden at love's first kiss. They slept beneath a hut of branches, and awoke at peep of light refreshed for the toils of another day. Dorcas and the boy went on joyously, and even Reuben's spirit shone at intervals with an outward gladness; but inwardly there was a cold cold sorrow, which he compared to the snowdrifts lying deep in the glens and hollows of the rivulets while the leaves were brightly green above.

Cyrus Bourne was sufficiently skilled in the travel of the woods to observe that his father did not adhere to the course they had pursued in their expedition of the preceding autumn. They were now keeping farther to the north, striking out more directly from the settlements, and into a region of which savage beasts and savage men were as yet the sole possessors. The boy sometimes hinted his opinions upon the subject, and Reuben listened attentively, and once or twice altered the direction of their march in accordance with his son's counsel; but, having so done, he seemed ill at ease. His quick and wandering glances were sent forward apparently in search of enemies lurking behind the tree trunks, and, seeing nothing there, he would cast his eyes backwards as if in fear of some pursuer. Cyrus, perceiving that his father gradually resumed the old direction, forbore to interfere; nor, though something began to weigh upon his heart, did his adventurous nature permit him to regret the increased length and the mystery of their way.

On the afternoon of the fifth day they halted, and made their simple encampment nearly an hour before sunset. The face of the country, for the last few miles, had been diversified by swells of land resembling huge waves of a petrified sea; and in one of the corresponding hollows, a wild and romantic spot, had the family reared their hut and kindled their fire. There is something chilling, and yet heart-warming, in the thought of these three, united by strong bands of love and insulated from all that breathe beside. The dark and gloomy pines looked down upon them, and, as the wind swept through their tops, a pitying sound was heard in the forest; or did those old trees groan in fear that men were come to lay the axe to their roots at last? Reuben and his son, while Dorcas made ready their meal, proposed to wander out in search of game, of which that day's march had afforded no supply. The boy, promising not to quit the vicinity of the encampment, bounded off with a step as light and elastic as that of the deer he hoped to slay; while his father, feeling a transient happiness as he gazed after him, was about to pursue an opposite direction. Dorcas in the meanwhile, had seated herself near their fire of fallen branches upon the mossgrown and mouldering trunk of a tree uprooted years before. Her employment, diversified by an occasional glance at the pot, now beginning to simmer over the blaze, was the perusal of the current year's Massachusetts Almanac, which, with the exception of an old black-letter Bible, comprised all the literary wealth of the family. None pay a greater regard to arbitrary divisions of time than those who are excluded from society; and Dorcas mentioned, as if the information were of importance, that it was now the twelfth of May. Her husband started.

“The twelfth of May! I should remember it well,”muttered he, while many thoughts occasioned a momentary confusion in his mind.“Where am I? Whither am I wandering? Where did I leave him?”

Dorcas, too well accustomed to her husband's wayward moods to note any peculiarity of demeanor, now laid aside the almanac and addressed him in that mournful tone which the tender hearted appropriate to griefs long cold and dead.

“It was near this time of the month, eighteen years ago, that my poor father left this world for a better. He had a kind arm to hold his head and a kind voice to cheer him, Reuben, in his last moments; and the thought of the faithful care you took of him has comforted me many a time since. Oh, death would have been awful to a solitary man in a wild place like this!”

“Pray Heaven, Dorcas,”said Reuben, in a broken voice,—“pray Heaven that neither of us three dies solitary and lies unburied in this howling wilderness!”And he hastened away, leaving her to watch the fire beneath the gloomy pines.

Reuben Bourne's rapid pace gradually slackened as the pang, unintentionally inflicted by the words of Dorcas, became less acute. Many strange reflections, however, thronged upon him; and, straying onward rather like a sleep walker than a hunter, it was attributable to no care of his own that his devious course kept him in the vicinity of the encampment. His steps were imperceptibly led almost in a circle; nor did he observe that he was on the verge of a tract of land heavily timbered, but not with pine-trees. The place of the latter was here supplied by oaks and other of the harder woods; and around their roots clustered a dense and bushy under-growth, leaving, however, barren spaces between the trees, thick strewn with withered leaves. Whenever the rustling of the branches or the creaking of the trunks made a sound, as if the forest were waking from slumber, Reuben instinctively raised the musket that rested on his arm, and cast a quick, sharp glance on every side; but, convinced by a partial observation that no animal was near, he would again give himself up to his thoughts. He was musing on the strange influence that had led him away from his premeditated course, and so far into the depths of the wilderness. Unable to penetrate to the secret place of his soul where his motives lay hidden, he believed that a supernatural voice had called him onward, and that a supernatural power had obstructed his retreat. He trusted that it was Heaven's intent to afford him an opportunity of expiating his sin; he hoped that he might find the bones so long unburied; and that, having laid the earth over them, peace would throw its sunlight into the sepulchre of his heart. From these thoughts he was aroused by a rustling in the forest at some distance from the spot to which he had wandered. Perceiving the motion of some object behind a thick veil of undergrowth, he fired, with the instinct of a hunter and the aim of a practised marksman. A low moan, which told his success, and by which even animals cars express their dying agony, was unheeded by Reuben Bourne. What were the recollections now breaking upon him?

The thicket into which Reuben had fired was near the summit of a swell of land, and was clustered around the base of a rock, which, in the shape and smoothness of one of its surfaces, was not unlike a gigantic gravestone. As if reflected in a mirror, its likeness was in Reuben's memory. He even recognized the veins which seemed to form an inscription in forgotten characters: everything remained the same, except that a thick covert of bushes shrouded the lowerpart of the rock, and would have hidden Roger Malvin had he still been sitting there. Yet in the next moment Reuben's eye was caught by another change that time had effected since he last stood where he was now standing again behind the earthy roots of the uptorn tree. The sapling to which he had bound the bloodstained symbol of his vow had increased and strengthened into an oak, far indeed from its maturity, but with no mean spread of shadowy branches. There was one singularity observable in this tree which made Reuben tremble. The middle and lower branches were in luxuriant life, and an excess of vegetation had fringed the trunk almost to the ground; but a blight had apparently stricken the upper part of the oak, and the very topmost bough was withered, sapless, and utterly dead. Reuben remembered how the little banner had fluttered on that topmost bough, when it was green and lovely, eighteen years before. Whose guilt had blasted it?




Dorcas, after the departure of the two hunters, continued her preparations for their evening repast. Her sylvan table was the moss-covered trunk of a large fallen tree, on the broadest part of which she had spread a snow-white cloth and arranged what were left of the bright pewter vessels that had been her pride in the settlements. It had a strange aspect that one little spot of homely comfort in the desolate heart of Nature. The sunshine yet lingered upon the higher branches of the trees that grew on rising ground; but the shadows of evening had deepened into the hollow where the encampment was made, and the firelight began to redden as it gleamed up the tall trunks of the pines or hovered on the dense and obscure mass of foliage that circled round the spot. The heart of Dorcas was not sad; for she felt that it was better to journey in the wilderness with two whom she loved than to be a lonely woman in a crowd that cared not for her. As she busied herself in arranging seats of mouldering wood, covered with leaves, for Reuben and her son, her voice danced through the gloomy forest in the measure of a song that she had learned in youth. The rude melody, the production of a bard who won no name, was descriptive of a winter evening in a frontier cottage, when, secured from savage inroad by the high-piled snow-drifts, the family rejoiced by their own fireside. The whole song possessed the nameless charm peculiar to unborrowed thought, but four continually-recurring lines shone out from the rest like the blaze of the hearth whose joys they celebrated. Into them, working magic with a few simple words, the poet had instilled the very essence of domestic love and household happiness, and they were poetry and picture joined in one. As Dorcas sang, the walls of her forsaken home seemed to encircle her; she no longer saw the gloomy pines, nor heard the wind which still, as she began each verse, sent a heavy breath through the branches, and died away in a hollow moan from the burden of the song. She was aroused by the report of a gun in the vicinity of the encampment; and either the sudden sound, or her loneliness by the glowing fire, caused her to tremble violently. The next moment she laughed in the pride of a mother's heart.

“My beautiful young hunter! My boy has slain a deer!”she exclaimed, recollecting that in the direction whence the shot proceeded Cyrus had gone to the chase.

She waited a reasonable time to hear her son's light step bounding over the rustling leaves to tell of his success. But he did not immediately appear; and she sent her cheerful voice among the trees in search of him.

“Cyrus! Cyrus!”

His coming was still delayed; and she determined, as the report had apparently been very near, to seek for him in person. Her assistance, also, might be necessary in bringing home the venison which she flattered herself he had obtained. She therefore set forward, directing her steps by the long-past sound, and singing as she went, in order that the boy might be aware of her approach and run to meet her. From behind the trunk of every tree, and from every hiding-place in the thick foliage of the undergrowth, she hoped to discover the countenance of her son, laughing with the sportive mischief that is born of affection. The sun was now beneath the horizon, and the light that came down among the leaves was sufficiently dim to create many illusions in her expecting fancy. Several times she seemed indistinctly to see his face gazing out from among the leaves; and once she imagined that he stood beckoning to her at the base of a craggy rock. Keeping her eyes on this object, however, it proved to be no more than the trunk of an oak fringed to the very ground with little branches, one of which, thrust out farther than the rest, was shaken by the breeze. Making her way round the foot of the rock, she suddenly found herself close to her husband, who had approached in another direction. Leaning upon the butt of his gun, the muzzle of which rested upon the withered leaves, he was apparently absorbed in the contemplation of some object at his feet.

“How is this, Reuben? Have you slain the deer and fallen asleep over him?”exclaimed Dorcas, laughing cheerfully, on her first slight observation of his posture and appearance.

He stirred not, neither did he turn his eyes towards her; and a cold, shuddering fear, indefinite in its source and object, began to creep into her blood. She now perceived that her husband's face was ghastly pale, and his features were rigid, as if incapable of assuming any other expression than the strong despair which had hardened upon them. He gave not the slightest evidence that he was aware of her approach.

“For the love of Heaven, Reuben, speak to me!”cried Dorcas; and the strange sound of her own voice affrighted her even more than the dead silence.

Her husband started, stared into her face, drew her to the front of the rock, and pointed with his finger.

Oh, there lay the boy, asleep, but dreamless, upon the fallen forest leaves! His cheek rested upon his arm—his curled locks were thrown back from his brow—his limbs were slightly relaxed. Had a sudden weariness overcome the youthful hunter? Would his mother's voice arouse him? She knew that it was death.

“This broad rock is the gravestone of your near kindred, Dorcas,”said her husband.“Your tears will fall at once over your father and your son.”

She heard him not. With one wild shriek, that seemed to force its way from the sufferer's inmost soul, she sank insensible by the side of her dead boy. At that moment the withered topmost bough of the oak loosened itself in the stilly air, and fell in soft, light fragments upon the rock, upon the leaves, upon Reuben, upon his wife and child, and upon Roger Malvin's bones. Then Reuben's heart was stricken, and the tears gushed out like water from a rock. The vow that the wounded youth had made the blighted man had come to redeem. His sin was expiated,—the curse was gone from him; and in the hour when he had shed blood dearer to him than his own, a prayer, the first for years, went up to Heaven from the lips of Reuben Bourne.





THE PROPHETIC PICTURES


“But this painter!”cried Walter Ludlow, with animation.“He not only excels in his peculiar art, but possesses vast acquirements in all other learning and science. He talks Hebrew with Dr. Mather, and gives lectures in anatomy to Dr. Boylston. In a word, he will meet the best instructed man among us on his own ground. Moreover, he is a polished gentleman—a citizen of the world—yes, a true cosmopolite; for he will speak like a native of each clime and country of the globe, except our own forests, whither he is now going. Nor is all this what I most admire in him.”

“Indeed!”said Elinor, who had listened with a woman's interest to the description of such a man.“Yet this is admirable enough.”

“Surely it is,”replied her lover,“but far less so than his natural gift of adapting himself to every variety of character, insomuch that all men—and all women too, Elinor—shall find a mirror of themselves in this wonderful painter. But the greatest wonder is yet to be told.”

“Nay, if he have more wonderful attributes than these,”said Elinor, laughing,“Boston is a perilous abode for the poor gentleman. Are you telling me of a painter, or a wizard?”

“In truth,”answered he,“that question might be asked much more seriously than you suppose. They say that he paints not merely a man's features, but his mind and heart. He catches the secret sentiments and passions, and throws them upon the canvas, like sunshine—or perhaps, in the portraits of dark-souled men, like a gleam of infernal fire. It is an awful gift,”added Walter, lowering his voice from its tone of enthusiasm.“I shall be almost afraid to sit to him.”

“Walter, are you in earnest?”exclaimed Elinor.

“For Heaven's sake, dearest Elinor, do not let him paint the look which you now wear,”said her lover, smiling, though rather perplexed.“There: it is passing away now, but when you spoke you seemed frightened to death, and very sad besides. What were you thinking of?”

“Nothing, nothing,”answered Elinor hastily.“You paint my face with your own fantasies. Well, come for me tomorrow, and we will visit this wonderful artist.”

But when the young man had departed, it cannot be denied that a remarkable expression was again visible on the fair and youthful face of his mistress. It was a sad and anxious look, little in accordance with what should have been the feelings of a maiden on the eve of wedlock. Yet Walter Ludlow was the chosen of her heart.

“A look!”said Elinor to herself.“No wonder that it startled him, if it expressed what I sometimes feel. I know, by my own experience, how frightful a look may be. But it was all fancy. I thought nothing of it at the time—I have seen nothing of it since—I did but dream it.”

And she busied herself about the embroidery of a ruff, in which she meant that her portrait should be taken.

The painter, of whom they had been speaking, was not one of those native artists who, at a later period than this, borrowed their colors from the Indians, and manufactured their pencils of the furs of wild beasts. Perhaps, if he could have revoked his life and prearranged his destiny, he might have chosen to belong to that school without a master, in the hope of being at least original, since there were no works of art to imitate nor rules to follow. But he had been born and educated in Europe. People said that he had studied the grandeur or beauty of conception, and every touch of the master hand, in all the most famous pictures, in cabinets and galleries, and on the walls of churches, till there was nothing more for his powerful mind to learn. Art could add nothing to its lessons, but Nature might. He had therefore visited a world whither none of his professional brethren had preceded him, to feast his eyes on visible images that were noble and picturesque, yet had never been transferred to canvas. America was too poor to afford other temptations to an artist of eminence, though many of the colonial gentry, on the painter's arrival, had expressed a wish to transmit their lineaments to posterity by means of his skill. Whenever such proposals were made, he fixed his piercing eyes on the applicant, and seemed to look him through and through. If he beheld only a sleek and comfortable visage, though there were a gold-laced coat to adorn the picture and golden guineas to pay for it, he civilly rejected the task and the reward. But if the face were the index of any thing uncommon, in thought, sentiment, or experience, or if he met a beggar in the street, with a white beard and a furrowed brow; or if sometimes a child happened to look up and smile, he would exhaust all the art on them that he denied to wealth.

Pictorial skill being so rare in the colonies, the painter became an object of general curiosity. If few or none could appreciate the technical merit of his productions, yet there were points, in regard to which the opinion of the crowd was as valuable as the refined judgment of the amateur. He watched the effect that each picture produced on such untutored beholders, and derived profit from their remarks, while they would as soon have thought of instructing Nature herself as him who seemed to rival her. Their admiration, it must be owned, was tinctured with the prejudices of the age and country. Some deemed it an offence against the Mosaic Law, and even a presumptuous mockery of the Creator, to bring into existence such lively images of his creatures. Others, frightened at the art which could raise phantoms at will, and keep the form of the dead among the living, were inclined to consider the painter as a magician, or perhaps the famous Black Man, of old witch times, plotting mischief in a new guise. These foolish fancies were more than half believed among the mob. Even in superior circles his character was invested with a vague awe, partly rising like smoke wreaths from the popular superstitions, but chiefly caused by the varied knowledge and talents which he made subservient to his profession.

Being on the eve of marriage, Walter Ludlow and Elinor were eager to obtain their portraits, as the first of what, they doubtless hoped, would be a long series of family pictures. The day after the conversation above recorded they visited the painter's rooms. A servant ushered them into an apartment, where, though the artist himself was not visible, there were personages whom they could hardly forbear greeting with reverence. They knew, indeed, that the whole assembly were but pictures, yet felt it impossible to separate the idea of life and intellect from such striking counterfeits. Several of the portraits were known to them, either as distinguished characters of the day or their private acquaintances. There was Governor Burnet, looking as if he had just received an undutiful communication from the House of Representatives, and were inditing a most sharp response. Mr. Cooke hung beside the ruler whom he opposed, sturdy, and somewhat puritanical, as befitted a popular leader. The ancient lady of Sir William Phipps eyed them from the wall, in ruff and farthingale,—an imperious old dame, not unsuspected of witchcraft. John Winslow, then a very young man, wore the expression of warlike enterprise, which long afterward made him a distinguished general. Their personal friends were recognized at a glance. In most of the pictures the whole mind and character were brought out on the countenance, and concentrated into a single look, so that, to speak paradoxically, the originals hardly resembled themselves so strikingly as the portraits did.

Among these modern worthies there were two old bearded Saints, who had almost vanished into the darkening canvas. There was also a pale, but unfaded Madonna , who had perhaps been worshipped in Rome, and now regarded the lovers with such a mild and holy look that they longed to worship too.

“How singular a thought,”observed Walter Ludlow,“that this beautiful face has been beautiful for above two hundred years! Oh, if all beauty would endure so well! Do you not envy her, Elinor?”

“If earth were heaven, I might,”she replied.“But where all things fade, how miserable to be the one that could not fade!”

“This dark old St. Peter has a fierce and ugly scowl, saint though he be,”continued Walter.“He troubles me. But the Virgin looks kindly at us.”

“Yes; but very sorrowfully, methinks,”said Elinor.

The easel stood beneath these three old pictures, sustaining one that had been recently commenced. After a little inspection, they began to recognize the features of their own minister, the Rev. Dr. Colman, growing into shape and life, as it were, out of a cloud.

“Kind old man!”exclaimed Elinor.“He gazes at me as if he were about to utter a word of paternal advice.”

“And at me,”said Walter,“as if he were about to shake his head and rebuke me for some suspected iniquity. But so does the original. I shall never feel quite comfortable under his eye till we stand before him to be married.”

They now heard a footstep on the floor, and turning, beheld the painter, who had been some moments in the room, and had listened to a few of their remarks. He was a middle-aged man, with a countenance well worthy of his own pencil. Indeed, by the picturesque, though careless arrangement of his rich dress, and, perhaps, because his soul dwelt always among painted shapes, he looked somewhat like a portrait himself. His visitors were sensible of a kindred between the artist and his works, and felt as if one of the pictures had stepped from the canvas to salute them.

Walter Ludlow, who was slightly known to the painter, explained the object of their visit. While he spoke, a sunbeam was falling athwart his figure and Elinor's, with so happy an effect that they also seemed living pictures of youth and beauty, gladdened by bright fortune. The artist was evidently struck.

“My easel is occupied for several ensuing days, and my stay in Boston must be brief,”said he, thoughtfully; then, after an observant glance, he added,“but your wishes shall be gratified, though I disappoint the Chief Justice and Madam Oliver. I must not lose this opportunity, for the sake of painting a few ells of broadcloth and brocade.”

The painter expressed a desire to introduce both their portraits into one picture, and represent them engaged in some appropriate action. This plan would have delighted the lovers, but was necessarily rejected, because so large a space of canvas would have been unfit for the room which it was intended to decorate. Two half-length portraits were therefore fixed upon. After they had taken leave, Walter Ludlow asked Elinor, with a smile, whether she knew what an influence over their fates the painter was about to acquire.

“The old women of Boston affirm,”continued he,“that after he has once got possession of a person's face and figure, he may paint him in any act or situation whatever—and the picture will be prophetic. Do you believe it?”

“Not quite,”said Elinor, smiling.“Yet if he has such magic, there is something so gentle in his manner that I am sure he will use it well.”

It was the painter's choice to proceed with both the portraits at the same time, assigning as a reason, in the mystical language which he sometimes used, that the faces threw light upon each other. Accordingly he gave now a touch to Walter, and now to Elinor, and the features of one and the other began to start forth so vividly that it appeared as if his triumphant art would actually disengage them from the canvas. Amid the rich light and deep shade, they beheld their phantom selves. But, though the likeness promised to be perfect, they were not quite satisfied with the expression; it seemed more vague than in most of the painter's works. He, however, was satisfied with the prospect of success, and being much interested in the lovers, employed his leisure moments, unknown to them, in making a crayon sketch of their two figures. During their sittings, he engaged them in conversation, and kindled up their faces with characteristic traits, which, though continually varying, it was his purpose to combine and fix. At length he announced that at their next visit both the portraits would be ready for delivery.

“If my pencil will but be true to my conception, in the few last touches which I meditate,”observed he,“these two pictures will be my very best performances. Seldom, indeed, has an artist such subjects.”

While speaking, he still bent his penetrative eye upon them, nor withdrew it till they had reached the bottom of the stairs.

Nothing, in the whole circle of human vanities, takes stronger hold of the imagination than this affair of having a portrait painted. Yet why should it be so? The looking-glass, the polished globes of the andirons, the mirror-like water, and all other reflecting surfaces, continually present us with portraits, or rather ghosts of ourselves, which we glance at, and straightway forget them. But we forget them only because they vanish. It is the idea of duration—of earthy immortality—that gives such a mysterious interest to our own portraits. Walter and Elinor were not insensible to this feeling, and hastened to the painter's room, punctually at the appointed hour, to meet those pictured shapes which were to be their representatives with posterity. The sunshine flashed after them into the apartment, but left it somewhat gloomy as they closed the door.

Their eyes were immediately attracted to their portraits, which rested against the farthest wall of the room. At the first glance, through the dim light and the distance, seeing themselves in precisely their natural attitudes, and with all the air that they recognized so well, they uttered a simultaneous exclamation of delight.

“There we stand,”cried Walter, enthusiastically,“fixed in sunshine forever! No dark passions can gather on our faces!”

“No,”said Elinor, more calmly;“no dreary change can sadden us.”

This was said while they were approaching, and had yet gained only an imperfect view of the pictures. The painter, after saluting them, busied himself at a table in completing a crayon sketch, leaving his visitors to form their own judgment as to his perfected labors. At intervals, he sent a glance from beneath his deep eyebrows, watching their countenances in profile, with his pencil suspended over the sketch. They had now stood some moments, each in front of the other's picture, contemplating it with entranced attention, but without uttering a word. At length, Walter stepped forward—then back—viewing Elinor's portrait in various lights, and finally spoke.

“Is there not a change?”said he, in a doubtful and meditative tone.“Yes; the perception of it grows more vivid the longer I look. It is certainly the same picture that I saw yesterday; the dress—the features—all are the same; and yet something is altered.”

“Is then the picture less like than it was yesterday?”inquired the painter, now drawing near, with irrepressible interest.

“The features are perfect, Elinor,”answered Walter,“and, at the first glance, the expression seemed also hers. But, I could fancy that the portrait has changed countenance, while I have been looking at it. The eyes are fixed on mine with a strangely sad and anxious expression. Nay, it is grief and terror! Is this like Elinor?”

“Compare the living face with the pictured one,”said the painter.

Walter glanced sidelong at his mistress, and started. Motionless and absorbed—fascinated, as it were—in contemplation of Walter's portrait, Elinor's face had assumed precisely the expression of which he had just been complaining. Had she practised for whole hours before a mirror, she could not have caught the look so successfully. Had the picture itself been a mirror, it could not have thrown back her present aspect with stronger and more melancholy truth. She appeared quite unconscious of the dialogue between the artist and her lover.

“Elinor,”exclaimed Walter, in amazement,“what change has come over you?”

She did not hear him, nor desist from her fixed gaze, till he seized her hand, and thus attracted her notice; then, with a sudden tremor, she looked from the picture to the face of the original.

“Do you see no change in your portrait?”asked she.

“In mine?—None!”replied Walter, examining it.“But let me see. Yes; there is a slight change—an improvement, I think, in the picture, though none in the likeness. It has a livelier expression than yesterday, as if some bright thought were flashing from the eyes, and about to be uttered from the lips. Now that I have caught the look, it becomes very decided.”

While he was intent on these observations, Elinor turned to the painter. She regarded him with grief and awe, and felt that he repaid her with sympathy and commiseration, though wherefore, she could but vaguely guess.

“That look!”whispered she, and shuddered.“How came it there?”

“Madam,”said the painter, sadly, taking her hand, and leading her apart,“in both these pictures, I have painted what I saw. The artist—the true artist—must look beneath the exterior. It is his gift—his proudest, but often a melancholy one—to see the inmost soul, and, by a power indefinable even to himself, to make it glow or darken upon the canvas, in glances that express the thought and sentiment of years. Would that I might convince myself of error in the present instance!”

They had now approached the table, on which were heads in chalk, hands almost as expressive as ordinary faces, ivied church-towers, thatched cottages, old thunder-stricken trees, Oriental and antique costume, and all such picturesque vagaries of an artist's idle moments. Turning them over, with seeming carelessness, a crayon sketch of two figures was disclosed.

“If I have failed,”continued he—“if your heart does not see itself reflected in your own portrait—if you have no secret cause to trust my delineation of the other—it is not yet too late to alter them. I might change the action of these figures too. But would it influence the event?”

He directed her notice to the sketch. A thrill ran through Elinor's frame; a shriek was upon her lips; but she stifled it, with the self-command that becomes habitual to all who hide thoughts of fear and anguish within their bosoms. Turning from the table, she perceived that Walter had advanced near enough to have seen the sketch, though she could not determine whether it had caught his eye.

“We will not have the pictures altered,”said she, hastily.“If mine is sad, I shall but look the gayer for the contrast.”

“Be it so,”answered the painter, bowing.“May your griefs be such fanciful ones that only your picture may mourn for them! For your joys—may they be true and deep, and paint themselves upon this lovely face till it quite belie my art!”

After the marriage of Walter and Elinor, the pictures formed the two most splendid ornaments of their abode. They hung side by side, separated by a narrow panel, appearing to eye each other constantly, yet always returning the gaze of the spectator. Travelled gentlemen, who professed a knowledge of such subjects, reckoned these among the most admirable specimens of modern portraiture; while common observers compared them with the originals, feature by feature, and were rapturous in praise of the likeness. But it was on a third class— neither travelled connoisseurs nor common observers, but people of natural sensibility—that the pictures wrought their strongest effect. Such persons might gaze carelessly at first, but, becoming interested, would return day after day, and study these painted faces like the pages of a mystic volume. Walter Ludlow's portrait attracted their earliest notice. In the absence of himself and his bride, they sometimes disputed as to the expression which the painter had intended to throw upon the features; all agreeing that there was a look of earnest import, though no two explained it alike. There was less diversity of opinion in regard to Elinor's picture. They differed, indeed, in their attempts to estimate the nature and depth of the gloom that dwelt upon her face, but agreed that it was gloom, and alien from the natural temperament of their youthful friend. A certain fanciful person announced, as the result of much scrutiny, that both these pictures were parts of one design, and that the melancholy strength of feeling, in Elinor's countenance, bore reference to the more vivid emotion, or, as he termed it, the wild passion, in that of Walter. Though unskilled in the art, he even began a sketch, in which the action of the two figures was to correspond with their mutual expression.

It was whispered among friends that, day by day, Elinor's face was assuming a deeper shade of pensiveness, which threatened soon to render her too true a counterpart of her melancholy picture. Walter, on the other hand, instead of acquiring the vivid look which the painter had given him on the canvas, became reserved and downcast, with no outward flashes of emotion, however it might be smouldering within. In course of time, Elinor hung a gorgeous curtain of purple silk, wrought with flowers and fringed with heavy golden tassels, before the pictures, under pretence that the dust would tarnish their hues, or the light dim them. It was enough. Her visitors felt, that the massive folds of the silk must never be withdrawn, nor the portraits mentioned in her presence.

Time wore on; and the painter came again. He had been far enough to the north to see the silver cascade of the Crystal Hills, and to look over the vast round of cloud and forest from the summit of New England's loftiest mountain. But he did not profane that scene by the mockery of his art. He had also lain in a canoe on the bosom of Lake George, making his soul the mirror of its loveliness and grandeur, till not a picture in the Vatican was more vivid than his recollection. He had gone with the Indian hunters to Niagara, and there, again, had flung his hopeless pencil down the precipice, feeling that he could as soon paint the roar, as aught else that goes to make up the wondrous cataract. In truth, it was seldom his impulse to copy natural scenery, except as a framework for the delineations of the human form and face, instinct with thought, passion, or suffering. With store of such his adventurous ramble had enriched him: the stern dignity of Indian chiefs; the dusky loveliness of Indian girls; the domestic life of wigwams; the stealthy march; the battle beneath gloomy pine-trees; the frontier fortress with its garrison; the anomaly of the old French partisan, bred in courts, but grown gray in shaggy deserts; such were the scenes and portraits that he had sketched. The glow of perilous moments; flashes of wild feeling; struggles of fierce power—love, hate, grief, frenzy; in a word, all the worn-out heart of the old earth had been revealed to him under a new form. His portfolio was filled with graphic illustrations of the volume of his memory, which genius would transmute into its own substance, and imbue with immortality. He felt that the deep wisdom in his art, which he had sought so far, was found.

But amid stern or lovely nature, in the perils of the forest or its overwhelming peacefulness, still there had been two phantoms, the companions of his way. Like all other men around whom an engrossing purpose wreathes itself, he was insulated from the mass of human kind. He had no aim—no pleasure—no sympathies—but what were ultimately connected with his art. Though gentle in manner and upright in intent and action, he did not possess kindly feelings; his heart was cold; no living creature could be brought near enough to keep him warm. For these two beings, however, he had felt, in its greatest intensity, the sort of interest which always allied him to the subjects of his pencil. He had pried into their souls with his keenest insight, and pictured the result upon their features with his utmost skill, so as barely to fall short of that standard which no genius ever reached, his own severe conception. He had caught from the duskiness of the future—at least, so he fancied—a fearful secret, and had obscurely revealed it on the portraits. So much of himself— of his imagination and all other powers—had been lavished on the study of Walter and Elinor, that he almost regarded them as creations of his own, like the thousands with which he had peopled the realms of Picture. Therefore did they flit through the twilight of the woods, hover on the mist of waterfalls, look forth from the mirror of the lake, nor melt away in the noontide sun. They haunted his pictorial fancy, not as mockeries of life, nor pale goblins of the dead, but in the guise of portraits, each with the unalterable expression which his magic had evoked from the caverns of the soul. He could not recross the Atlantic till he had again beheld the originals of those airy pictures.

“O glorious Art!”Thus mused the enthusiastic painter as he trod the street.“Thou art the image of the Creator's own. The innumerable forms, that wander in nothingness, start into being at thy beck. The dead live again. Thou recallest them to their old scenes, and givest their gray shadows the lustre of a better life, at once earthly and immortal. Thou snatchest back the fleeting moments of History. With thee there is no Past, for, at thy touch, all that is great becomes forever present; and illustrious men live through long ages, in the visible performance of the very deeds which made them what they are. O potent Art! as thou bringest the faintly revealed Past to stand in that narrow strip of sunlight, which we call Now, canst thou summon the shrouded Future to meet her there? Have I not achieved it? Am I not thy Prophet?”

Thus, with a proud, yet melancholy fervor, did he almost cry aloud, as he passed through the toilsome street, among people that knew not of his reveries, nor could understand nor care for them. It is not good for man to cherish a solitary ambition. Unless there be those around him by whose example he may regulate himself, his thoughts, desires, and hopes will become extravagant, and he the semblance, perhaps the reality, of a madman. Reading other bosoms with an acuteness almost preternatural, the painter failed to see the disorder of his own.

“And this should be the house,”said he, looking up and down the front, before he knocked.“Heaven help my brains! That picture! Methinks it will never vanish. Whether I look at the windows or the door, there it is framed within them, painted strongly, and glowing in the richest tints—the faces of the portraits—the figures and action of the sketch!”

He knocked.

“The Portraits! Are they within?”inquired he of the domestic; then recollecting himself—“your master and mistress! Are they at home?”

“They are, sir,”said the servant, adding, as he noticed that picturesque aspect of which the painter could never divest himself,“and the Portraits too!”

The guest was admitted into a parlor, communicating by a central door with an interior room of the same size. As the first apartment was empty, he passed to the entrance of the second, within which his eyes were greeted by those living personages, as well as their pictured representatives, who had long been the objects of so singular an interest. He involuntarily paused on the threshold.

They had not perceived his approach. Walter and Elinor were standing before the portraits, whence the former had just flung back the rich and voluminous folds of the silken curtain, holding its golden tassel with one hand, while the other grasped that of his bride. The pictures, concealed for months, gleamed forth again in undiminished splendor, appearing to throw a sombre light across the room, rather than to be disclosed by a borrowed radiance. That of Elinor had been almost prophetic. A pensiveness, and next a gentle sorrow, had successively dwelt upon her countenance, deepening, with the lapse of time, into a quiet anguish. A mixture of affright would now have made it the very expression of the portrait. Walter's face was moody and dull, or animated only by fitful flashes, which left a heavier darkness for their momentary illumination. He looked from Elinor to her portrait, and thence to his own, in the contemplation of which he finally stood absorbed.

The painter seemed to hear the step of Destiny approaching behind him, on its progress towards its victims. A strange thought darted into his mind. Was not his own the form in which that destiny had embodied itself, and he a chief agent of the coming evil which he had foreshadowed?

Still, Walter remained silent before the picture, communing with it as with his own heart, and abandoning himself to the spell of evil influence that the painter had cast upon the features. Gradually his eyes kindled; while as Elinor watched the increasing wildness of his face, her own assumed a look of terror; and when at last, he turned upon her, the resemblance of both to their portraits was complete.

“Our fate is upon us!”howled Walter.“Die!”

Drawing a knife, he sustained her, as she was sinking to the ground, and aimed it at her bosom. In the action, and in the look and attitude of each, the painter beheld the figures of his sketch. The picture, with all its tremendous coloring, was finished.

“Hold, madman!”cried he, sternly.

He had advanced from the door, and interposed himself between the wretched beings, with the same sense of power to regulate their destiny as to alter a scene upon the canvas. He stood like a magician, controlling the phantoms which he had evoked.

“What!”muttered Walter Ludlow, as he relapsed from fierce excitement into silent gloom.“Does Fate impede its own decree?”

“Wretched lady!”said the painter,“did I not warn you?”

“You did,”replied Elinor, calmly, as her terror gave place to the quiet grief which it had disturbed.“But—I love him!”

Is there not a deep moral in the tale? Could the result of one, or all our deeds, be shadowed forth and set before us, some would call it Fate, and hurry onward, others be swept along by their passionate desires, and none be turned aside by the Prophetic Pictures.





THE ARTIST OF THE BEAUTIFUL


An elderly man, with his pretty daughter on his arm, was passing along the street, and emerged from the gloom of the cloudy evening into the light that fell across the pavement from the window of a small shop. It was a projecting window; and on the inside were suspended a variety of watches, pinchbeck, silver, and one or two of gold, all with their faces turned from the streets, as if churlishly disinclined to inform the wayfarers what o'clock it was. Seated within the shop, sidelong to the window, with his pale face bent earnestly over some delicate piece of mechanism on which was thrown the concentrated lustre of a shade lamp, appeared a young man.

“What can Owen Warland be about?”muttered old Peter Hovenden, himself a retired watchmaker, and the former master of this same young man whose occupation he was now wondering at.“What can the fellow be about? These six months past I have never come by his shop without seeing him just as steadily at work as now. It would be a flight beyond his usual foolery to seek for the perpetual motion; and yet I know enough of my old business to be certain that what he is now so busy with is no part of the machinery of a watch.”

“Perhaps, father,”said Annie, without showing much interest in the question,“Owen is inventing a new kind of timekeeper. I am sure he has ingenuity enough.”

“Poh, child! He has not the sort of ingenuity to invent anything better than a Dutch toy,”answered her father, who had formerly been put to much vexation by Owen Warland's irregular genius.“A plague on such ingenuity! All the effect that ever I knew of it was to spoil the accuracy of some of the best watches in my shop. He would turn the sun out of its orbit and derange the whole course of time, if, as I said before, his ingenuity could grasp anything bigger than a child's toy!”

“Hush, father! He hears you!”whispered Annie, pressing the old man's arm.“His ears are as delicate as his feelings; and you know how easily disturbed they are. Do let us move on.”

So Peter Hovenden and his daughter Annie plodded on without further conversation, until in a by-street of the town they found themselves passing the open door of a blacksmith's shop. Within was seen the forge, now blazing up and illuminating the high and dusky roof, and now confining its lustre to a narrow precinct of the coal-strewn floor, according as the breath of the bellows was puffed forth or again inhaled into its vast leathern lungs. In the intervals of brightness it was easy to distinguish objects in remote corners of the shop and the horseshoes that hung upon the wall; in the momentary gloom the fire seemed to be glimmering amidst the vagueness of unenclosed space. Moving about in this red glare and alternate dusk was the figure of the blacksmith, well worthy to be viewed in so picturesque an aspect of light and shade, where the bright blaze struggled with the black night, as if each would have snatched his comely strength from the other. Anon he drew a white-hot bar of iron from the coals, laid it on the anvil, uplifted his arm of might, and was soon enveloped in the myriads of sparks which the strokes of his hammer scattered into the surrounding gloom.

“Now, that is a pleasant sight,”said the old watchmaker.“I know what it is to work in gold; but give me the worker in iron after all is said and done. He spends his labor upon a reality. What say you, daughter Annie?”

“Pray don't speak so loud, father,”whispered Annie,“Robert Danforth will hear you.”

“And what if he should hear me?”said Peter Hovenden.“I say again, it is a good and a wholesome thing to depend upon main strength and reality, and to earn one's bread with the bare and brawny arm of a blacksmith. A watchmaker gets his brain puzzled by his wheels within a wheel, or loses his health or the nicety of his eyesight, as was my case, and finds himself at middle age, or a little after, past labor at his own trade and fit for nothing else, yet too poor to live at his ease. So I say once again, give me main strength for my money. And then, how it takes the nonsense out of a man! Did you ever hear of a blacksmith being such a fool as Owen Warland yonder?”

“Well said, uncle Hovenden!”shouted Robert Danforth from the forge, in a full, deep, merry voice, that made the roof re.cho.“And what says Miss Annie to that doctrine? She, I suppose, will think it a genteeler business to tinker up a lady's watch than to forge a horseshoe or make a gridiron.”

Annie drew her father onward without giving him time for reply.

But we must return to Owen Warland's shop, and spend more meditation upon his history and character than either Peter Hovenden, or probably his daughter Annie, or Owen's old school-fellow, Robert Danforth, would have thought due to so slight a subject. From the time that his little fingers could grasp a penknife, Owen had been remarkable for a delicate ingenuity, which sometimes produced pretty shapes in wood, principally figures of flowers and birds, and sometimes seemed to aim at the hidden mysteries of mechanism. But it was always for purposes of grace, and never with any mockery of the useful. He did not, like the crowd of school-boy artisans, construct little windmills on the angle of a barn or watermills across the neighboring brook. Those who discovered such peculiarity in the boy as to think it worth their while to observe him closely, sometimes saw reason to suppose that he was attempting to imitate the beautiful movements of Nature as exemplified in the flight of birds or the activity of little animals. It seemed, in fact, a new development of the love of the beautiful, such as might have made him a poet, a painter, or a sculptor, and which was as completely refined from all utilitarian coarseness as it could have been in either of the fine arts. He looked with singular distaste at the stiff and regular processes of ordinary machinery. Being once carried to see a steam-engine, in the expectation that his intuitive comprehension of mechanical principles would be gratified, he turned pale and grew sick, as if something monstrous and unnatural had been presented to him. This horror was partly owing to the size and terrible energy of the iron laborer; for the character of Owen's mind was microscopic, and tended naturally to the minute, in accordance with his diminutive frame and the marvellous smallness and delicate power of his fingers. Not that his sense of beauty was thereby diminished into a sense of prettiness. The beautiful idea has no relation to size, and may be as perfectly developed in a space too minute for any but microscopic investigation as within the ample verge that is measured by the arc of the rainbow. But, at all events, this characteristic minuteness in his objects and accomplishments made the world even more incapable than it might otherwise have been of appreciating Owen Warland's genius. The boy's relatives saw nothing better to be done—as perhaps there was not—than to bind him apprentice to a watchmaker, hoping that his strange ingenuity might thus be regulated and put to utilitarian purposes.

Peter Hovenden's opinion of his apprentice has already been expressed. He could make nothing of the lad. Owen's apprehension of the professional mysteries, it is true, was inconceivably quick; but he altogether forgot or despised the grand object of a watchmaker's business, and cared no more for the measurement of time than if it had been merged into eternity. So long, however, as he remained under his old master's care, Owen's lack of sturdiness made it possible, by strict injunctions and sharp oversight, to restrain his creative eccentricity within bounds; but when his apprenticeship was served out, and he had taken the little shop which Peter Hovenden's failing eyesight compelled him to relinquish, then did people recognize how unfit a person was Owen Warland to lead old blind Father Time along his daily course. One of his most rational projects was to connect a musical operation with the machinery of his watches, so that all the harsh dissonances of life might be rendered tuneful, and each flitting moment fall into the abyss of the past in golden drops of harmony. If a family clock was intrusted to him for repair,—one of those tall, ancient clocks that have grown nearly allied to human nature by measuring out the lifetime of many generations,—he would take upon himself to arrange a dance or funeral procession of figures across its venerable face, representing twelve mirthful or melancholy hours. Several freaks of this kind quite destroyed the young watchmaker's credit with that steady and matter-of-fact class of people who hold the opinion that time is not to be trifled with, whether considered as the medium of advancement and prosperity in this world or preparation for the next. His custom rapidly diminished—a misfortune, however, that was probably reckoned among his better accidents by Owen Warland, who was becoming more and more absorbed in a secret occupation which drew all his science and manual dexterity into itself, and likewise gave full employment to the characteristic tendencies of his genius. This pursuit had already consumed many months.

After the old watchmaker and his pretty daughter had gazed at him out of the obscurity of the street, Owen Warland was seized with a fluttering of the nerves, which made his hand tremble too violently to proceed with such delicate labor as he was now engaged upon.

“It was Annie herself!”murmured he.“I should have known it, by this throbbing of my heart, before I heard her father's voice. Ah, how it throbs! I shall scarcely be able to work again on this exquisite mechanism to-night. Annie! dearest Annie! thou shouldst give firmness to my heart and hand, and not shake them thus; for if I strive to put the very spirit of beauty into form and give it motion, it is for thy sake alone. O throbbing heart, be quiet! If my labor be thus thwarted, there will come vague and unsatisfied dreams which will leave me spiritless to-morrow.”

As he was endeavoring to settle himself again to his task, the shop door opened and gave admittance to no other than the stalwart figure which Peter Hovenden had paused to admire, as seen amid the light and shadow of the blacksmith's shop. Robert Danforth had brought a little anvil of his own manufacture, and peculiarly constructed, which the young artist had recently bespoken. Owen examined the article and pronounced it fashioned according to his wish.

“Why, yes,”said Robert Danforth, his strong voice filling the shop as with the sound of a bass viol,“I consider myself equal to anything in the way of my own trade; though I should have made but a poor figure at yours with such a fist as this,”added he, laughing, as he laid his vast hand beside the delicate one of Owen.“But what then? I put more main strength into one blow of my sledge hammer than all that you have expended since you were a 'prentice. Is not that the truth?”

“Very probably,”answered the low and slender voice of Owen.“Strength is an earthly monster. I make no pretensions to it. My force, whatever there may be of it, is altogether spiritual.”

“Well, but, Owen, what are you about?”asked his old school-fellow, still in such a hearty volume of tone that it made the artist shrink, especially as the question related to a subject so sacred as the absorbing dream of his imagination.“Folks do say that you are trying to discover the perpetual motion.”

“The perpetual motion? Nonsense!”replied Owen Warland, with a movement of disgust; for he was full of little petulances.“It can never be discovered. It is a dream that may delude men whose brains are mystified with matter, but not me. Besides, if such a discovery were possible, it would not be worth my while to make it only to have the secret turned to such purposes as are now effected by steam and water power. I am not ambitious to be honored with the paternity of a new kind of cotton machine.”

“That would be droll enough!”cried the blacksmith, breaking out into such an uproar of laughter that Owen himself and the bell glasses on his work board quivered in unison.“No, no, Owen! No child of yours will have iron joints and sinews. Well, I won't hinder you any more. Good night, Owen, and success, and if you need any assistance, so far as a downright blow of hammer upon anvil will answer the purpose, I'm your man.”

And with another laugh the man of main strength left the shop.

“How strange it is,”whispered Owen Warland to himself, leaning his head upon his hand,“that all my musings, my purposes, my passion for the beautiful, my consciousness of power to create it,—a finer, more ethereal power, of which this earthly giant can have no conception,—all, all, look so vain and idle whenever my path is crossed by Robert Danforth! He would drive me mad were I to meet him often. His hard, brute force darkens and confuses the spiritual element within me; but I, too, will be strong in my own way. I will not yield to him.”

He took from beneath a glass a piece of minute machinery, which he set in the condensed light of his lamp, and, looking intently at it through a magnifying glass, proceeded to operate with a delicate instrument of steel. In an instant, however, he fell back in his chair and clasped his hands, with a look of horror on his face that made its small features as impressive as those of a giant would have been.

“Heaven! What have I done?”exclaimed he.“The vapor, the influence of that brute force,—it has bewildered me and obscured my perception. I have made the very stroke—the fatal stroke—that I have dreaded from the first. It is all over—the toil of months, the object of my life. I am ruined!”

And there he sat, in strange despair, until his lamp flickered in the socket and left the Artist of the Beautiful in darkness.

Thus it is that ideas, which grow up within the imagination and appear so lovely to it and of a value beyond whatever men call valuable, are exposed to be shattered and annihilated by contact with the practical. It is requisite for the ideal artist to possess a force of character that seems hardly compatible with its delicacy; he must keep his faith in himself while the incredulous world assails him with its utter disbelief; he must stand up against mankind and be his own sole disciple, both as respects his genius and the objects to which it is directed.

For a time Owen Warland succumbed to this severe but inevitable test. He spent a few sluggish weeks with his head so continually resting in his hands that the towns-people had scarcely an opportunity to see his countenance. When at last it was again uplifted to the light of day, a cold, dull, nameless change was perceptible upon it. In the opinion of Peter Hovenden, however, and that order of sagacious understandings who think that life should be regulated, like clockwork, with leaden weights, the alteration was entirely for the better. Owen now, indeed, applied himself to business with dogged industry. It was marvellous to witness the obtuse gravity with which he would inspect the wheels of a great old silver watch; thereby delighting the owner, in whose fob it had been worn till he deemed it a portion of his own life, and was accordingly jealous of its treatment. In consequence of the good report thus acquired, Owen Warland was invited by the proper authorities to regulate the clock in the church steeple. He succeeded so admirably in this matter of public interest that the merchants gruffly acknowledged his merits on 'Change; the nurse whispered his praises as she gave the potion in the sick-chamber; the lover blessed him at the hour of appointed interview; and the town in general thanked Owen for the punctuality of dinner time. In a word, the heavy weight upon his spirits kept everything in order, not merely within his own system, but wheresoever the iron accents of the church clock were audible. It was a circumstance, though minute, yet characteristic of his present state, that, when employed to engrave names or initials on silver spoons, he now wrote the requisite letters in the plainest possible style, omitting a variety of fanciful flourishes that had heretofore distinguished his work in this kind.

One day, during the era of this happy transformation, old Peter Hovenden came to visit his former apprentice.

“Well, Owen,”said he,“I am glad to hear such good accounts of you from all quarters, and especially from the town clock yonder, which speaks in your commendation every hour of the twenty-four. Only get rid altogether of your nonsensical trash about the beautiful, which I nor nobody else, nor yourself to boot, could ever understand,—only free yourself of that, and your success in life is as sure as daylight. Why, if you go on in this way, I should even venture to let you doctor this precious old watch of mine; though, except my daughter Annie, I have nothing else so valuable in the world.”

“I should hardly dare touch it, sir,”replied Owen, in a depressed tone; for he was weighed down by his old master's presence.

“In time,”said the latter,—“in time, you will be capable of it.”

The old watchmaker, with the freedom naturally consequent on his former authority, went on inspecting the work which Owen had in hand at the moment, together with other matters that were in progress. The artist, meanwhile, could scarcely lift his head. There was nothing so antipodal to his nature as this man's cold, unimaginative sagacity, by contact with which everything was converted into a dream except the densest matter of the physical world. Owen groaned in spirit and prayed fervently to be delivered from him.

“But what is this?”cried Peter Hovenden abruptly, taking up a dusty bell glass, beneath which appeared a mechanical something, as delicate and minute as the system of a butterfly's anatomy.“What have we here? Owen! Owen! there is witchcraft in these little chains, and wheels, and paddles. See! with one pinch of my finger and thumb I am going to deliver you from all future peril.”

“For Heaven's sake,”screamed Owen Warland, springing up with wonderful energy,“as you would not drive me mad, do not touch it! The slightest pressure of your finger would ruin me forever.”

“Aha, young man! And is it so?”said the old watchmaker, looking at him with just enough of penetration to torture Owen's soul with the bitterness of worldly criticism.“Well, take your own course; but I warn you again that in this small piece of mechanism lives your evil spirit. Shall I exorcise him?”

“You are my evil spirit,”answered Owen, much excited,—“you and the hard, coarse world! The leaden thoughts and the despondency that you fling upon me are my clogs, else I should long ago have achieved the task that I was created for.”

Peter Hovenden shook his head, with the mixture of con-tempt and indignation which mankind, of whom he was partly a representative, deem themselves entitled to feel towards all simpletons who seek other prizes than the dusty one along the highway. He then took his leave, with an uplifted finger and a sneer upon his face that haunted the artist's dreams for many a night afterwards. At the time of his old master's visit, Owen was probably on the point of taking up the relinquished task; but, by this sinister event, he was thrown back into the state whence he had been slowly emerging.

But the innate tendency of his soul had only been accumulating fresh vigor during its apparent sluggishness. As the summer advanced he almost totally relinquished his business, and permitted Father Time, so far as the old gentleman was represented by the clocks and watches under his control, to stray at random through human life, making infinite confusion among the train of bewildered hours. He wasted the sunshine, as people said, in wandering through the woods and fields and along the banks of streams. There, like a child, he found amusement in chasing butterflies or watching the motions of water insects. There was something truly mysterious in the intentness with which he contemplated these living playthings as they sported on the breeze or examined the structure of an imperial insect whom he had imprisoned. The chase of butterflies was an apt emblem of the ideal pursuit in which he had spent so many golden hours; but would the beautiful idea ever be yielded to his hand like the butterfly that symbolized it? Sweet, doubtless, were these days, and congenial to the artist's soul. They were full of bright conceptions, which gleamed through his intellectual world as the butterflies gleamed through the outward atmosphere, and were real to him, for the instant, without the toil, and perplexity, and many disappointments of attempting to make them visible to the sensual eye. Alas that the artist, whether in poetry, or whatever other material, may not content himself with the inward enjoyment of the beautiful, but must chase the flitting mystery beyond the verge of his ethereal domain, and crush its frail being in seizing it with a material grasp. Owen Warland felt the impulse to give external reality to his ideas as irresistibly as any of the poets or painters who have arrayed the world in a dimmer and fainter beauty, imperfectly copied from the richness of their visions.

The night was now his time for the slow progress of re-creating the one idea to which all his intellectual activity referred itself. Always at the approach of dusk he stole into the town, locked himself within his shop, and wrought with patient delicacy of touch for many hours. Sometimes he was startled by the rap of the watchman, who, when all the world should be asleep, had caught the gleam of lamplight through the crevices of Owen Warland's shutters. Daylight, to the morbid sensibility of his mind, seemed to have an intrusiveness that interfered with his pursuits. On cloudy and inclement days, therefore, he sat with his head upon his hands, muffling, as it were, his sensitive brain in a mist of indefinite musings, for it was a relief to escape from the sharp distinctness with which he was compelled to shape out his thoughts during his nightly toil.

From one of these fits of torpor he was aroused by the entrance of Annie Hovenden, who came into the shop with the freedom of a customer, and also with something of the familiarity of a childish friend. She had worn a hole through her silver thimble, and wanted Owen to repair it.

“But I don't know whether you will condescend to such a task,”said she, laughing,“now that you are so taken up with the notion of putting spirit into machinery.”

“Where did you get that idea, Annie?”said Owen, starting in surprise.

“Oh, out of my own head,”answered she,“and from something that I heard you say, long ago, when you were but a boy and I a little child. But come; will you mend this poor thimble of mine?”

“Anything for your sake, Annie,”said Owen Warland,—“anything, even were it to work at Robert Danforth's forge.”

“And that would be a pretty sight!”retorted Annie, glancing with imperceptible slightness at the artist's small and slender frame.“Well; here is the thimble.”

“But that is a strange idea of yours,”said Owen,“about the spiritualization of matter.”

And then the thought stole into his mind that this young girl possessed the gift to comprehend him better than all the world besides. And what a help and strength would it be to him in his lonely toil if he could gain the sympathy of the only being whom he loved! To persons whose pursuits are insulated from the common business of life—who are either in advance of mankind or apart from it—there often comes a sensation of moral cold that makes the spirit shiver as if it had reached the frozen solitudes around the pole. What the prophet, the poet, the reformer, the criminal, or any other man with human yearnings, but separated from the multitude by a peculiar lot, might feel, poor Owen felt.

“Annie,”cried he, growing pale as death at the thought,“how gladly would I tell you the secret of my pursuit! You, methinks, would estimate it rightly. You, I know, would hear it with a reverence that I must not expect from the harsh, material world.”

“Would I not? to be sure I would!”replied Annie Hovenden, lightly laughing.“Come; explain to me quickly what is the meaning of this little whirligig, so delicately wrought, that it might be a plaything for Queen Mab. See! I will put it in motion.”

“Hold!”exclaimed Owen,“hold!”

Annie had but given the slightest possible touch, with the point of a needle, to the same minute portion of complicated machinery which has been more than once mentioned, when the artist seized her by the wrist with a force that made her scream aloud. She was affrighted at the convulsion of intense rage and anguish that writhed across his features. The next instant he let his head sink upon his hands.

“Go, Annie,”murmured he;“I have deceived myself, and must suffer for it. I yearned for sympathy and thought, and fancied, and dreamed that you might give it me; but you lack the talisman, Annie, that should admit you into my secrets. That touch has undone the toil of months and the thought of a lifetime! It was not your fault, Annie; but you have ruined me!”

Poor Owen Warland! He had indeed erred, yet pardonably; for if any human spirit could have sufficiently reverenced the processes so sacred in his eyes, it must have been a woman's. Even Annie Hovenden, possibly, might not have disappointed him had she been enlightened by the deep intelligence of love.

The artist spent the ensuing winter in a way that satisfied any persons who had hitherto retained a hopeful opinion of him that he was, in truth, irrevocably doomed to inutility as regarded the world, and to an evil destiny on his own part. The decease of a relative had put him in possession of a small inheritance. Thus freed from the necessity of toil, and having lost the steadfast influence of a great purpose,—great, at least, to him,—he abandoned himself to habits from which it might have been supposed the mere delicacy of his organization would have availed to secure him. But when the ethereal portion of a man of genius is obscured, the earthly part assumes an influence the more uncontrollable, because the character is now thrown off the balance to which Providence had so nicely adjusted it, and which, in coarser natures, is adjusted by some other method. Owen Warland made proof of whatever show of bliss may be found in riot. He looked at the world through the golden medium of wine, and contemplated the visions that bubble up so gayly around the brim of the glass, and that people the air with shapes of pleasant madness, which so soon grow ghostly and forlorn. Even when this dismal and inevitable change had taken place, the young man might still have continued to quaff the cup of enchantments, though its vapor did but shroud life in gloom and fill the gloom with spectres that mocked at him. There was a certain irksomeness of spirit, which, being real, and the deepest sensation of which the artist was now conscious, was more intolerable than any fantastic miseries and horrors that the abuse of wine could summon up. In the latter case he could remember, even out of the midst of his trouble, that all was but a delusion; in the former, the heavy anguish was his actual life.

From this perilous state he was redeemed by an incident which more than one person witnessed, but of which the shrewdest could not explain or conjecture the operation on Owen Warland's mind. It was very simple. On a warm afternoon of spring, as the artist sat among his riotous companions with a glass of wine before him, a splendid butterfly flew in at the open window and fluttered about his head.

“Ah,”exclaimed Owen, who had drank freely,“are you alive again, child of the sun and playmate of the summer breeze, after your dismal winter's nap? Then it is time for me to be at work!”

And, leaving his unemptied glass upon the table, he departed and was never known to sip another drop of wine.

And now, again, he resumed his wanderings in the woods and fields. It might be fancied that the bright butterfly, which had come so spirit-like into the window as Owen sat with the rude revellers, was indeed a spirit commissioned to recall him to the pure, ideal life that had so etherealized him among men. It might be fancied that he went forth to seek this spirit in its sunny haunts; for still, as in the summer time gone by, he was seen to steal gently up wherever a butterfly had alighted, and lose himself in contemplation of it. When it took flight his eyes followed the winged vision, as if its airy track would show the path to heaven. But what could be the purpose of the unseasonable toil, which was again resumed, as the watchman knew by the lines of lamplight through the crevices of Owen Warland's shutters? The towns-people had one comprehensive explanation of all these singularities. Owen Warland had gone mad! How universally efficacious—how satisfactory, too, and soothing to the injured sensibility of narrowness and dulness—is this easy method of accounting for whatever lies beyond the world's most ordinary scope! From St. Paul's days down to our poor little Artist of the Beautiful, the same talisman had been applied to the elucidation of all mysteries in the words or deeds of men who spoke or acted too wisely or too well. In Owen Warland's case the judgment of his towns-people may have been correct. Perhaps he was mad. The lack of sympathy—that contrast between himself and his neighbors which took away the restraint of example—was enough to make him so. Or possibly he had caught just so much of ethereal radiance as served to bewilder him, in an earthly sense, by its intermixture with the common daylight.

One evening, when the artist had returned from a customary ramble and had just thrown the lustre of his lamp on the delicate piece of work so often interrupted, but still taken up again, as if his fate were embodied in its mechanism, he was surprised by the entrance of old Peter Hovenden. Owen never met this man without a shrinking of the heart. Of all the world he was most terrible, by reason of a keen understanding which saw so distinctly what it did see, and disbelieved so uncompromisingly in what it could not see. On this occasion the old watchmaker had merely a gracious word or two to say.

“Owen, my lad,”said he,“we must see you at my house to-morrow night.”

The artist began to mutter some excuse.

“Oh, but it must be so,”quoth Peter Hovenden,“for the sake of the days when you were one of the household. What, my boy! don't you know that my daughter Annie is engaged to Robert Danforth? We are making an entertainment, in our humble way, to celebrate the event.”

“Ah,”said Owen.

That little monosyllable was all he uttered; its tone seemed cold and unconcerned to an ear like Peter Hovenden's; and yet there was in it the stifled outcry of the poor artist's heart, which he compressed within him like a man holding down an evil spirit. One slight outbreak, however, imperceptible to the old watchmaker, he allowed himself. Raising the instrument with which he was about to begin his work, he let it fall upon the little system of machinery that had, anew, cost him months of thought and toil. It was shattered by the stroke!

Owen Warland's story would have been no tolerable represen-tation of the troubled life of those who strive to create the beautiful, if, amid all other thwarting influences, love had not interposed to steal the cunning from his hand. Outwardly he had been no ardent or enterprising lover; the career of his passion had confined its tumults and vicissitudes so entirely within the artist's imagination that Annie herself had scarcely more than a woman's intuitive perception of it; but, in Owen's view, it covered the whole field of his life. Forgetful of the time when she had shown herself incapable of any deep response, he had persisted in connecting all his dreams of artistical success with Annie's image; she was the visible shape in which the spiritual power that he worshipped, and on whose altar he hoped to lay a not unworthy offering, was made manifest to him. Of course he had deceived himself; there were no such attributes in Annie Hovenden as his imagination had endowed her with. She, in the aspect which she wore to his inward vision, was as much a creature of his own as the mysterious piece of mechanism would be were it ever realized. Had he become convinced of his mistake through the medium of successful love,—had he won Annie to his bosom, and there beheld her fade from angel into ordinary woman,—the disappointment might have driven him back, with concentrated energy, upon his sole remaining object. On the other hand, had he found Annie what he fancied, his lot would have been so rich in beauty that out of its mere redundancy he might have wrought the beautiful into many a worthier type than he had toiled for; but the guise in which his sorrow came to him, the sense that the angel of his life had been snatched away and given to a rude man of earth and iron, who could neither need nor appreciate her ministrations,—this was the very perversity of fate that makes human existence appear too absurd and contradictory to be the scene of one other hope or one other fear. There was nothing left for Owen Warland but to sit down like a man that had been stunned.

He went through a fit of illness. After his recovery his small and slender frame assumed an obtuser garniture of flesh than it had ever before worn. His thin cheeks became round; his delicate little hand, so spiritually fashioned to achieve fairy task-work, grew plumper than the hand of a thriving infant. His aspect had a childishness such as might have induced a stranger to pat him on the head—pausing, however, in the act, to wonder what manner of child was here. It was as if the spirit had gone out of him, leaving the body to flourish in a sort of vegetable existence. Not that Owen Warland was idiotic. He could talk, and not irrationally. Somewhat of a babbler, indeed, did people begin to think him; for he was apt to discourse at wearisome length of marvels of mechanism that he had read about in books, but which he had learned to consider as absolutely fabulous. Among them he enumerated the Man of Brass, constructed by Albertus Magnus, and the Brazen Head of Friar Bacon; and, coming down to later times, the automata of a little coach and horses, which it was pretended had been manufactured for the Dauphin of France; together with an insect that buzzed about the ear like a living fly, and yet was but a contrivance of minute steel springs. There was a story, too, of a duck that waddled, and quacked, and ate; though, had any honest citizen purchased it for dinner, he would have found himself cheated with the mere mechanical apparition of a duck.

“But all these accounts,”said Owen Warland,“I am now satisfied are mere impositions.”

Then, in a mysterious way, he would confess that he once thought differently. In his idle and dreamy days he had considered it possible, in a certain sense, to spiritualize machinery, and to combine with the new species of life and motion thus produced a beauty that should attain to the ideal which Nature has proposed to herself in all her creatures, but has never taken pains to realize. He seemed, however, to retain no very distinct perception either of the process of achieving this object or of the design itself.

“I have thrown it all aside now,”he would say.“It was a dream such as young men are always mystifying themselves with. Now that I have acquired a little common sense, it makes me laugh to think of it.”

Poor, poor and fallen Owen Warland! These were the symptoms that he had ceased to be an inhabitant of the better sphere that lies unseen around us. He had lost his faith in the invisible, and now prided himself, as such unfortunates invariably do, in the wisdom which rejected much that even his eye could see, and trusted confidently in nothing but what his hand could touch. This is the calamity of men whose spiritual part dies out of them and leaves the grosser understanding to assimilate them more and more to the things of which alone it can take cognizance; but in Owen Warland the spirit was not dead nor passed away; it only slept.

How it awoke again is not recorded. Perhaps the torpid slumber was broken by a convulsive pain. Perhaps, as in a former instance, the butterfly came and hovered about his head and reinspired him,— as indeed this creature of the sunshine had always a mysterious mission for the artist,—reinspired him with the former purpose of his life. Whether it were pain or happiness that thrilled through his veins, his first impulse was to thank Heaven for rendering him again the being of thought, imagination, and keenest sensibility that he had long ceased to be.

“Now for my task,”said he.“Never did I feel such strength for it as now.”

Yet, strong as he felt himself, he was incited to toil the more diligently by an anxiety lest death should surprise him in the midst of his labors. This anxiety, perhaps, is common to all men who set their hearts upon anything so high, in their own view of it, that life becomes of importance only as conditional to its accomplishment. So long as we love life for itself, we seldom dread the losing it. When we desire life for the attainment of an object, we recognize the frailty of its texture. But, side by side with this sense of insecurity, there is a vital faith in our invulnerability to the shaft of death while engaged in any task that seems assigned by Providence as our proper thing to do, and which the world would have cause to mourn for should we leave it unaccomplished. Can the philosopher, big with the inspiration of an idea that is to reform mankind, believe that he is to be beckoned from this sensible existence at the very instant when he is mustering his breath to speak the word of light? Should he perish so, the weary ages may pass away—the world's, whose life sand may fall, drop by drop—before another intellect is prepared to develop the truth that might have been uttered then. But history affords many an example where the most precious spirit, at any particular epoch manifested in human shape, has gone hence untimely, without space allowed him, so far as mortal judgment could discern, to perform his mission on the earth. The prophet dies, and the man of torpid heart and sluggish brain lives on. The poet leaves his song half sung, or finishes it, beyond the scope of mortal ears, in a celestial choir. The painter—as Allston did—leaves half his conception on the canvas to sadden us with its imperfect beauty, and goes to picture forth the whole, if it be no irreverence to say so, in the hues of heaven. But rather such incomplete designs of this life will be perfected nowhere. This so frequent abortion of man's dearest projects must be taken as a proof that the deeds of earth, however etherealized by piety or genius, are without value, except as exercises and manifestations of the spirit. In heaven, all ordinary thought is higher and more melodious than Milton's song. Then, would he add another verse to any strain that he had left unfinished here?

But to return to Owen Warland. It was his fortune, good or ill, to achieve the purpose of his life. Pass we over a long space of intense thought, yearning effort, minute toil, and wasting anxiety, succeeded by an instant of solitary triumph: let all this be imagined; and then behold the artist, on a winter evening, seeking admittance to Robert Danforth's fireside circle. There he found the man of iron, with his massive substance thoroughly warmed and attempered by domestic influences. And there was Annie, too, now transformed into a matron, with much of her husband's plain and sturdy nature, but imbued, as Owen Warland still believed, with a finer grace, that might enable her to be the interpreter between strength and beauty. It happened, likewise, that old Peter Hovenden was a guest this evening at his daughter's fireside, and it was his well-remembered expression of keen, cold criticism that first encountered the artist's glance.

“My old friend Owen!”cried Robert Danforth, starting up, and compressing the artist's delicate fingers within a hand that was accustomed to gripe bars of iron.“This is kind and neighborly to come to us at last. I was afraid your perpetual motion had bewitched you out of the remembrance of old times.”

“We are glad to see you,”said Annie, while a blush reddened her matronly cheek.“It was not like a friend to stay from us so long.”

“Well, Owen,”inquired the old watchmaker, as his first greeting,“how comes on the beautiful? Have you created it at last?”

The artist did not immediately reply, being startled by the apparition of a young child of strength that was tumbling about on the carpet,—a little personage who had come mysteriously out of the infinite but with something so sturdy and real in his composition that he seemed moulded out of the densest substance which earth could supply. This hopeful infant crawled towards the new-comer, and setting himself on end, as Robert Danforth expressed the posture, stared at Owen with a look of such sagacious observation that the mother could not help exchanging a proud glance with her husband. But the artist was disturbed by the child's look, as imagining a resemblance between it and Peter Hovenden's habitual expression. He could have fancied that the old watchmaker was compressed into this baby shape, and looking out of those baby eyes, and repeating, as he now did, the malicious question:—

“The beautiful, Owen! How comes on the beautiful? Have you succeeded in creating the beautiful?”

“I have succeeded,”replied the artist, with a momentary light of triumph in his eyes and a smile of sunshine, yet steeped in such depth of thought that it was almost sadness.“Yes, my friends, it is the truth. I have succeeded.”

“Indeed!”cried Annie, a look of maiden mirthfulness peeping out of her face again.“And is it lawful, now, to inquire what the secret is?”

“Surely; it is to disclose it that I have come,”answered Owen Warland.“You shall know, and see, and touch, and possess the secret! For, Annie,—if by that name I may still address the friend of my boyish years,—Annie, it is for your bridal gift that I have wrought this spiritualized mechanism, this harmony of motion, this mystery of beauty. It comes late, indeed; but it is as we go onward in life, when objects begin to lose their freshness of hue and our souls their delicacy of perception, that the spirit of beauty is most needed. If,—forgive me, Annie,—if you know how to value this gift, it can never come too late.”

He produced, as he spoke, what seemed a jewel box. It was carved richly out of ebony by his own hand, and inlaid with a fanciful tracery of pearl, representing a boy in pursuit of a butterfly, which, elsewhere, had become a winged spirit, and was flying heavenward; while the boy, or youth, had found such efficacy in his strong desire that he ascended from earth to cloud, and from cloud to celestial atmosphere, to win the beautiful. This case of ebony the artist opened, and bade Annie place her finger on its edge. She did so, but almost screamed as a butterfly fluttered forth, and, alighting on her finger's tip, sat waving the ample magnificence of its purple and gold-speckled wings, as if in prelude to a flight. It is impossible to express by words the glory, the splendor, the delicate gorgeousness which were softened into the beauty of this object. Nature's ideal butterfly was here realized in all its perfection; not in the pattern of such faded insects as flit among earthly flowers, but of those which hover across the meads of paradise for child-angels and the spirits of departed infants to disport themselves with. The rich down was visible upon its wings; the lustre of its eyes seemed instinct with spirit. The firelight glimmered around this wonder—the candles gleamed upon it; but it glistened apparently by its own radiance, and illuminated the finger and outstretched hand on which it rested with a white gleam like that of precious stones. In its perfect beauty, the consideration of size was entirely lost. Had its wings overreached the firmament, the mind could not have been more filled or satisfied.

“Beautiful! beautiful!”exclaimed Annie.“Is it alive? Is it alive?”

“Alive? To be sure it is,”answered her husband.“Do you suppose any mortal has skill enough to make a butterfly, or would put himself to the trouble of making one, when any child may catch a score of them in a summer's afternoon? Alive? Certainly! But this pretty box is undoubtedly of our friend Owen's manufacture; and really it does him credit.”

At this moment the butterfly waved its wings anew, with a motion so absolutely lifelike that Annie was startled, and even awestricken; for, in spite of her husband's opinion, she could not satisfy herself whether it was indeed a living creature or a piece of wondrous mechanism.

“Is it alive?”she repeated, more earnestly than before.

“Judge for yourself,”said Owen Warland, who stood gazing in her face with fixed attention.

The butterfly now flung itself upon the air, fluttered round Annie's head, and soared into a distant region of the parlor, still making itself perceptible to sight by the starry gleam in which the motion of its wings enveloped it. The infant on the floor followed its course with his sagacious little eyes. After flying about the room, it returned in a spiral curve and settled again on Annie's finger.

“But is it alive?”exclaimed she again; and the finger on which the gorgeous mystery had alighted was so tremulous that the butterfly was forced to balance himself with his wings.“Tell me if it be alive, or whether you created it.”

“Wherefore ask who created it, so it be beautiful?”replied Owen Warland.“Alive? Yes, Annie; it may well be said to possess life, for it has absorbed my own being into itself; and in the secret of that butterfly, and in its beauty,—which is not merely outward, but deep as its whole system,—is represented the intellect, the imagination, the sensibility, the soul of an Artist of the Beautiful! Yes; I created it. But”—and here his countenance somewhat changed—“this butterfly is not now to me what it was when I beheld it afar off in the daydreams of my youth.”

“Be it what it may, it is a pretty plaything,”said the blacksmith, grinning with childlike delight.“I wonder whether it would condescend to alight on such a great clumsy finger as mine? Hold it hither, Annie.”

By the artist's direction, Annie touched her finger's tip to that of her husband; and, after a momentary delay, the butterfly fluttered from one to the other. It preluded a second flight by a similar, yet not precisely the same, waving of wings as in the first experiment; then, ascending from the blacksmith's stalwart finger, it rose in a gradually enlarging curve to the ceiling, made one wide sweep around the room, and returned with an undulating movement to the point whence it had started.

“Well, that does beat all nature!”cried Robert Danforth, bestowing the heartiest praise that he could find expression for; and, indeed, had he paused there, a man of finer words and nicer perception could not easily have said more.

“That goes beyond me, I confess. But what then? There is more real use in one downright blow of my sledge hammer than in the whole five years' labor that our friend Owen has wasted on this butterfly.”

Here the child clapped his hands and made a great babble of indistinct utterance, apparently demanding that the butterfly should be given him for a plaything.

Owen Warland, meanwhile, glanced sidelong at Annie, to discover whether she sympathized in her husband's estimate of the comparative value of the beautiful and the practical. There was, amid all her kindness towards himself, amid all the wonder and admiration with which she contemplated the marvellous work of his hands and incarnation of his idea, a secret scorn—too secret, perhaps, for her own consciousness, and perceptible only to such intuitive discernment as that of the artist. But Owen, in the latter stages of his pursuit, had risen out of the region in which such a discovery might have been torture. He knew that the world, and Annie as the representative of the world, whatever praise might be bestowed, could never say the fitting word nor feel the fitting sentiment which should be the perfect recompense of an artist who, symbolizing a lofty moral by a material trifle,—converting what was earthly to spiritual gold,—had won the beautiful into his handiwork. Not at this latest moment was he to learn that the reward of all high performance must be sought within itself, or sought in vain. There was, however, a view of the matter which Annie and her husband, and even Peter Hovenden, might fully have understood, and which would have satisfied them that the toil of years had here been worthily bestowed. Owen Warland might have told them that this butterfly, this plaything, this bridal gift of a poor watchmaker to a blacksmith's wife, was, in truth, a gem of art that a monarch would have purchased with honors and abundant wealth, and have treasured it among the jewels of his kingdom as the most unique and wondrous of them all. But the artist smiled and kept the secret to himself.

“Father,”said Annie, thinking that a word of praise from the old watchmaker might gratify his former apprentice,“do come and admire this pretty butterfly.”

“Let us see,”said Peter Hovenden, rising from his chair, with a sneer upon his face that always made people doubt, as he himself did, in everything but a material existence.“Here is my finger for it to alight upon. I shall understand it better when once I have touched it.”

But, to the increased astonishment of Annie, when the tip of her father's finger was pressed against that of her husband, on which the butterfly still rested, the insect drooped its wings and seemed on the point of falling to the floor. Even the bright spots of gold upon its wings and body, unless her eyes deceived her, grew dim, and the glowing purple took a dusky hue, and the starry lustre that gleamed around the blacksmith's hand became faint and vanished.

“It is dying! it is dying!”cried Annie, in alarm.

“It has been delicately wrought,”said the artist, calmly.“As I told you, it has imbibed a spiritual essence—call it magnetism, or what you will. In an atmosphere of doubt and mockery its exquisite susceptibility suffers torture, as does the soul of him who instilled his own life into it. It has already lost its beauty; in a few moments more its mechanism would be irreparably injured.”

“Take away your hand, father!”entreated Annie, turning pale.“Here is my child; let it rest on his innocent hand. There, perhaps, its life will revive and its colors grow brighter than ever.”

Her father, with an acrid smile, withdrew his finger. The butterfly then appeared to recover the power of voluntary motion, while its hues assumed much of their original lustre, and the gleam of starlight, which was its most ethereal attribute, again formed a halo round about it. At first, when transferred from Robert Danforth's hand to the small finger of the child, this radiance grew so powerful that it positively threw the little fellow's shadow back against the wall. He, meanwhile, extended his plump hand as he had seen his father and mother do, and watched the waving of the insect's wings with infantine delight. Nevertheless, there was a certain odd expression of sagacity that made Owen Warland feel as if here were old Peter Hovenden, partially, and but partially, redeemed from his hard scepticism into childish faith.

“How wise the little monkey looks!”whispered Robert Danforth to his wife.

“I never saw such a look on a child's face,”answered Annie, admiring her own infant, and with good reason, far more than the artistic butterfly.“The darling knows more of the mystery than we do.”

As if the butterfly, like the artist, were conscious of something not entirely congenial in the child's nature, it alternately sparkled and grew dim. At length it arose from the small hand of the infant with an airy motion that seemed to bear it upward without an effort, as if the ethereal instincts with which its master's spirit had endowed it impelled this fair vision involuntarily to a higher sphere. Had there been no obstruction, it might have soared into the sky and grown immortal. But its lustre gleamed upon the ceiling; the exquisite texture of its wings brushed against that earthly medium; and a sparkle or two, as of stardust, floated downward and lay glimmering on the carpet. Then the butterfly came fluttering down, and, instead of returning to the infant, was apparently attracted towards the artist's hand.

“Not so! not so!”murmured Owen Warland, as if his handiwork could have understood him.“Thou has gone forth out of thy master's heart. There is no return for thee.”

With a wavering movement, and emitting a tremulous radiance, the butterfly struggled, as it were, towards the infant, and was about to alight upon his finger; but while it still hovered in the air, the little child of strength, with his grandsire's sharp and shrewd expression in his face, made a snatch at the marvellous insect and compressed it in his hand. Annie screamed. Old Peter Hovenden burst into a cold and scornful laugh. The blacksmith, by main force, unclosed the infant's hand, and found within the palm a small heap of glittering fragments, whence the mystery of beauty had fled forever. And as for Owen Warland, he looked placidly at what seemed the ruin of his life's labor, and which was yet no ruin. He had caught a far other butterfly than this. When the artist rose high enough to achieve the beautiful, the symbol by which he made it perceptible to mortal senses became of little value in his eyes while his spirit possessed itself in the enjoyment of the reality.





THE SNOW-IMAGE: A CHILDISH MIRACLE


One afternoon of a cold winter's day, when the sun shone forth with chilly brightness, after a long storm, two children asked leave of their mother to run out and play in the new-fallen snow. The elder child was a little girl, whom, because she was of a tender and modest disposition, and was thought to be very beautiful, her parents, and other people who were familiar with her, used to call Violet. But her brother was known by the style and title of Peony, on account of the ruddiness of his broad and round little phiz, which made everybody think of sunshine and great scarlet flowers. The father of these two children, a certain Mr. Lindsey, it is important to say, was an excellent but exceedingly matter-of-fact sort of man, a dealer in hardware, and was sturdily accustomed to take what is called the common-sense view of all matters that came under his consideration. With a heart about as tender as other people's, he had a head as hard and impenetrable, and therefore, perhaps, as empty, as one of the iron pots which it was a part of his business to sell. The mother's character, on the other hand, had a strain of poetry in it, a trait of unworldly beauty,—a delicate and dewy flower, as it were, that had survived out of her imaginative youth, and still kept itself alive amid the dusty realities of matrimony and motherhood.

So, Violet and Peony, as I began with saying, besought their mother to let them run out and play in the new snow; for, though it had looked so dreary and dismal, drifting downward out of the gray sky, it had a very cheerful aspect, now that the sun was shining on it. The children dwelt in a city, and had no wider play-place than a little garden before the house, divided by a white fence from the street, and with a pear-tree and two or three plum-trees overshadowing it, and some rose-bushes just in front of the parlor-windows. The trees and shrubs, however, were now leafless, and their twigs were enveloped in the light snow, which thus made a kind of wintry foliage, with here and there a pendent icicle for the fruit.

“Yes, Violet,—yes, my little Peony,”said their kind mother,“you may go out and play in the new snow.”

Accordingly, the good lady bundled up her darlings in woollen jackets and wadded sacks, and put comforters round their necks, and a pair of striped gaiters on each little pair of legs, and worsted mittens on their hands, and gave them a kiss apiece, by way of a spell to keep away Jack Frost. Forth sallied the two children, with a hop-skip-and-jump, that carried them at once into the very heart of a huge snow-drift, whence Violet emerged like a snow-bunting, while little Peony floundered out with his round face in full bloom. Then what a merry time had they! To look at them, frolicking in the wintry garden, you would have thought that the dark and pitiless storm had been sent for no other purpose but to provide a new plaything for Violet and Peony; and that they themselves had beer created, as the snow-birds were, to take delight only in the tempest, and in the white mantle which it spread over the earth.

At last, when they had frosted one another all over with handfuls of snow, Violet, after laughing heartily at little Peony's figure, was struck with a new idea.

“You look exactly like a snow-image, Peony,”said she,“if your cheeks were not so red. And that puts me in mind! Let us make an image out of snow,—an image of a little girl,—and it shall be our sister, and shall run about and play with us all winter long. Won't it be nice?”

“Oh yes!”cried Peony, as plainly as he could speak, for he was but a little boy.“That will be nice! And mamma shall see it!”

“Yes,”answered Violet;“mamma shall see the new little girl. But she must not make her come into the warm parlor; for, you know, our little snow-sister will not love the warmth.”

And forthwith the children began this great business of making a snow-image that should run about; while their mother, who was sitting at the window and overheard some of their talk, could not help smiling at the gravity with which they set about it. They really seemed to imagine that there would be no difficulty whatever in creating a live little girl out of the snow. And, to say the truth, if miracles are ever to be wrought, it will be by putting our hands to the work in precisely such a simple and undoubting frame of mind as that in which Violet and Peony now undertook to perform one, without so much as knowing that it was a miracle. So thought the mother; and thought, likewise, that the new snow, just fallen from heaven, would be excellent material to make new beings of, if it were not so very cold. She gazed at the children a moment longer, delighting to watch their little figures,—the girl, tall for her age, graceful and agile, and so delicately colored that she looked like a cheerful thought more than a physical reality; while Peony expanded in breadth rather than height, and rolled along on his short and sturdy legs as substantial as an elephant, though not quite so big. Then the mother resumed her work. What it was I forget; but she was either trimming a silken bonnet for Violet, or darning a pair of stockings for little Peony's short legs. Again, however, and again, and yet other agains, she could not help turning her head to the window to see how the children got on with their snow-image.

Indeed, it was an exceedingly pleasant sight, those bright little souls at their task! Moreover, it was really wonderful to observe how knowingly and skilfully they managed the matter. Violet assumed the chief direction, and told Peony what to do, while, with her own delicate fingers, she shaped out all the nicer parts of the snow-figure. It seemed, in fact, not so much to be made by the children, as to grow up under their hands, while they were playing and prattling about it. Their mother was quite surprised at this; and the longer she looked, the more and more surprised she grew.

“What remarkable children mine are!”thought she, smiling with a mother's pride; and, smiling at herself, too, for being so proud of them.“What other children could have made anything so like a little girl's figure out of snow at the first trial? Well; but now I must finish Peony's new frock, for his grandfather is coming to-morrow, and I want the little fellow to look handsome.”

So she took up the frock, and was soon as busily at work again with her needle as the two children with their snow-image. But still, as the needle travelled hither and thither through the seams of the dress, the mother made her toil light and happy by listening to the airy voices of Violet and Peony. They kept talking to one another all the time, their tongues being quite as active as their feet and hands. Except at intervals, she could not distinctly hear what was said, but had merely a sweet impression that they were in a most loving mood, and were enjoying themselves highly, and that the business of making the snow-image went prosperously on. Now and then, however, when Violet and Peony happened to raise their voices, the words were as audible as if they had been spoken in the very parlor where the mother sat. Oh how delightfully those words echoed in her heart, even though they meant nothing so very wise or wonderful, after all!

But you must know a mother listens with her heart much more than with her ears; and thus she is often delighted with the trills of celestial music, when other people can hear nothing of the kind.

“Peony, Peony!”cried Violet to her brother, who had gone to another part of the garden,“bring me some of that fresh snow, Peony, from the very farthest corner, where we have not been trampling. I want it to shape our little snow-sister's bosom with. You know that part must be quite pure, just as it came out of the sky!”

“Here it is, Violet!”answered Peony, in his bluff tone,—but a very sweet tone, too,—as he came floundering through the half-trodden drifts.“Here is the snow for her little bosom. O Violet, how beau-ti-ful she begins to look!”

“Yes,”said Violet, thoughtfully and quietly;“our snow-sister does look very lovely. I did not quite know, Peony, that we could make such a sweet little girl as this.”

The mother, as she listened, thought how fit and delightful an incident it would be, if fairies, or still better, if angel-children were to come from paradise, and play invisibly with her own darlings, and help them to make their snow-image, giving it the features of celestial babyhood! Violet and Peony would not be aware of their immortal playmates,—only they would see that the image grew very beautiful while they worked at it, and would think that they themselves had done it all.

“My little girl and boy deserve such playmates, if mortal children ever did!”said the mother to herself; and then she smiled again at her own motherly pride.

Nevertheless, the idea seized upon her imagination; and, ever and anon, she took a glimpse out of the window, half dreaming that she might see the golden-haired children of paradise sporting with her own golden-haired Violet and bright-cheeked Peony.

Now, for a few moments, there was a busy and earnest, but indistinct hum of the two children's voices, as Violet and Peony wrought together with one happy consent. Violet still seemed to be the guiding spirit, while Peony acted rather as a laborer, and brought her the snow from far and near. And yet the little urchin evidently had a proper understanding of the matter, too!

“Peony, Peony!”cried Violet; for her brother was again at the other side of the garden.“Bring me those light wreaths of snow that have rested on the lower branches of the pear-tree. You can clamber on the snowdrift, Peony, and reach them easily. I must have them to make some ringlets for our snow-sister's head!”

“Here they are, Violet!”answered the little boy.“Take care you do not break them. Well done! Well done! How pretty!”

“Does she not look sweetly?”said Violet, with a very satisfied tone;“and now we must have some little shining bits of ice, to make the brightness of her eyes. She is not finished yet. Mamma will see how very beautiful she is; but papa will say, 'Tush! nonsense!— come in out of the cold!'”

“Let us call mamma to look out,”said Peony; and then he shouted lustily,“mamma! mamma!! mamma!!! Look out, and see what a nice 'ittle girl we are making!”

The mother put down her work for an instant, and looked out of the window. But it so happened that the sun—for this was one of the shortest days of the whole year—had sunken so nearly to the edge of the world that his setting shine came obliquely into the lady's eyes. So she was dazzled, you must understand, and could not very distinctly observe what was in the garden. Still, however, through all that bright, blinding dazzle of the sun and the new snow, she beheld a small white figure in the garden, that seemed to have a wonderful deal of human likeness about it. And she saw Violet and Peony,—indeed, she looked more at them than at the image,—she saw the two children still at work; Peony bringing fresh snow, and Violet applying it to the figure as scientifically as a sculptor adds clay to his model. Indistinctly as she discerned the snow-child, the mother thought to herself that never before was there a snow-figure so cunningly made, nor ever such a dear little girl and boy to make it.

“They do everything better than other children,”said she, very complacently.“No wonder they make better snow-images!”

She sat down again to her work, and made as much haste with it as possible; because twilight would soon come, and Peony's frock was not yet finished, and grandfather was expected, by railroad, pretty early in the morning. Faster and faster, therefore, went her flying fingers. The children, likewise, kept busily at work in the garden, and still the mother listened, whenever she could catch a word. She was amused to observe how their little imaginations had got mixed up with what they were doing, and carried away by it. They seemed positively to think that the snow-child would run about and play with them.

“What a nice playmate she will be for us, all winter long!”said Violet.“I hope papa will not be afraid of her giving us a cold! Sha'n't you love her dearly, Peony?”

“Oh yes!”cried Peony.“And I will hug her, and she shall sit down close by me and drink some of my warm milk!”

“Oh no, Peony!”answered Violet, with grave wisdom.“That will not do at all. Warm milk will not be wholesome for our little snow-sister. Little snow people, like her, eat nothing but icicles. No, no, Peony; we must not give her anything warm to drink!”

There was a minute or two of silence; for Peony, whose short legs were never weary, had gone on a pilgrimage again to the other side of the garden. All of a sudden, Violet cried out, loudly and joyfully,—“Look here, Peony! Come quickly! A light has been shining on her cheek out of that rose-colored cloud! and the color does not go away! Is not that beautiful!”

“Yes; it is beau-ti-ful,”answered Peony, pronouncing the three syllables with deliberate accuracy.“O Violet, only look at her hair! It is all like gold!”

“Oh certainly,”said Violet, with tranquillity, as if it were very much a matter of course.“That color, you know, comes from the golden clouds, that we see up there in the sky. She is almost finished now. But her lips must be made very red,—redder than her cheeks. Perhaps, Peony, it will make them red if we both kiss them!”

Accordingly, the mother heard two smart little smacks, as if both her children were kissing the snow-image on its frozen mouth. But, as this did not seem to make the lips quite red enough, Violet next proposed that the snow-child should be invited to kiss Peony's scarlet cheek.

“Come, 'ittle snow-sister, kiss me!”cried Peony.

“There! she has kissed you,”added Violet,“and now her lips are very red. And she blushed a little, too!”

“Oh, what a cold kiss!”cried Peony.

Just then, there came a breeze of the pure west-wind, sweeping through the garden and rattling the parlor-windows. It sounded so wintry cold, that the mother was about to tap on the window-pane with her thimbled finger, to summon the two children in, when they both cried out to her with one voice. The tone was not a tone of surprise, although they were evidently a good deal excited; it appeared rather as if they were very much rejoiced at some event that had now happened, but which they had been looking for, and had reckoned upon all along.

“Mamma! mamma! We have finished our little snow-sister, and she is running about the garden with us!”

“What imaginative little beings my children are!”thought the mother, putting the last few stitches into Peony's frock.“And it is strange, too that they make me almost as much a child as they themselves are! I can hardly help believing, now, that the snow-image has really come to life!”

“Dear mamma!”cried Violet,“pray look out and see what a sweet playmate we have!”

The mother, being thus entreated, could no longer delay to look forth from the window. The sun was now gone out of the sky, leaving, however, a rich inheritance of his brightness among those purple and golden clouds which make the sunsets of winter so magnificent. But there was not the slightest gleam or dazzle, either on the window or on the snow; so that the good lady could look all over the garden, and see everything and everybody in it. And what do you think she saw there? Violet and Peony, of course, her own two darling children. Ah, but whom or what did she see besides? Why, if you will believe me, there was a small figure of a girl, dressed all in white, with rose-tinged cheeks and ringlets of golden hue, playing about the garden with the two children! A stranger though she was, the child seemed to be on as familiar terms with Violet and Peony, and they with her, as if all the three had been playmates during the whole of their little lives. The mother thought to herself that it must certainly be the daughter of one of the neighbors, and that, seeing Violet and Peony in the garden, the child had run across the street to play with them. So this kind lady went to the door, intending to invite the little runaway into her comfortable parlor; for, now that the sunshine was withdrawn, the atmosphere, out of doors, was already growing very cold.

But, after opening the house-door, she stood an instant on the threshold, hesitating whether she ought to ask the child to come in, or whether she should even speak to her. Indeed, she almost doubted whether it were a real child after all, or only a light wreath of the new-fallen snow, blown hither and thither about the garden by the intensely cold west-wind. There was certainly something very singular in the aspect of the little stranger. Among all the children of the neighborhood, the lady could remember no such face, with its pure white, and delicate rose-color, and the golden ringlets tossing about the forehead and cheeks. And as for her dress, which was entirely of white, and fluttering in the breeze, it was such as no reasonable woman would put upon a little girl, when sending her out to play, in the depth of winter. It made this kind and careful mother shiver only to look at those small feet, with nothing in the world on them, except a very thin pair of white slippers. Nevertheless, airily as she was clad, the child seemed to feel not the slightest inconvenience from the cold, but danced so lightly over the snow that the tips of her toes left hardly a print in its surface; while Violet could but just keep pace with her, and Peony's short legs compelled him to lag behind.

Once, in the course of their play, the strange child placed herself between Violet and Peony, and taking a hand of each, skipped merrily forward, and they along with her. Almost immediately, however, Peony pulled away his little fist, and began to rub it as if the fingers were tingling with cold; while Violet also released herself, though with less abruptness, gravely remarking that it was better not to take hold of hands. The white-robed damsel said not a word, but danced about, just as merrily as before. If Violet and Peony did not choose to play with her, she could make just as good a playmate of the brisk and cold west-wind, which kept blowing her all about the garden, and took such liberties with her, that they seemed to have been friends for a long time. All this while, the mother stood on the threshold, wondering how a little girl could look so much like a flying snow-drift, or how a snow-drift could look so very like a little girl.

She called Violet, and whispered to her.

“Violet my darling, what is this child's name?”asked she.“Does she live near us?”

“Why, dearest mamma,”answered Violet, laughing to think that her mother did not comprehend so very plain an affair,“this is our little snow-sister whom we have just been making!”

“Yes, dear mamma,”cried Peony, running to his mother, and looking up simply into her face.“This is our snow-image! Is it not a nice 'ittle child?”

At this instant a flock of snow-birds came flitting through the air. As was very natural, they avoided Violet and Peony. But—and this looked strange—they flew at once to the white-robed child, fluttered eagerly about her head, alighted on her shoulders, and seemed to claim her as an old acquaintance. She, on her part, was evidently as glad to see these little birds, old Winter's grandchildren, as they were to see her, and welcomed them by holding out both her hands. Hereupon, they each and all tried to alight on her two palms and ten small fingers and thumbs, crowding one another off, with an immense fluttering of their tiny wings. One dear little bird nestled tenderly in her bosom; another put its bill to her lips. They were as joyous, all the while, and seemed as much in their element, as you may have seen them when sporting with a snow-storm.

Violet and Peony stood laughing at this pretty sight; for they enjoyed the merry time which their new playmate was having with these small-winged visitants, almost as much as if they themselves took part in it.

“Violet,”said her mother, greatly perplexed,“tell me the truth, without any jest. Who is this little girl?”

“My darling mamma,”answered Violet, looking seriously into her mother's face, and apparently surprised that she should need any further explanation,“I have told you truly who she is. It is our little snow-image, which Peony and I have been making. Peony will tell you so, as well as I.”

“Yes, mamma,”asseverated Peony, with much gravity in his crimson little phiz;“this is 'ittle snow-child. Is not she a nice one? But, mamma, her hand is, oh, so very cold!”

While mamma still hesitated what to think and what to do, the street-gate was thrown open, and the father of Violet and Peony appeared, wrapped in a pilot-cloth sack, with a fur cap drawn down over his ears, and the thickest of gloves upon his hands. Mr. Lindsey was a middle-aged man, with a weary and yet a happy look in his wind-flushed and frost-pinched face, as if he had been busy all the day long, and was glad to get back to his quiet home. His eyes brightened at the sight of his wife and children, although he could not help uttering a word or two of surprise, at finding the whole family in the open air, on so bleak a day, and after sunset too. He soon perceived the little white stranger sporting to and fro in the garden, like a dancing snow-wreath, and the flock of snow-birds fluttering about her head.

“Pray, what little girl may that be?”inquired this very sensible man.“Surely her mother must be crazy to let her go out in such bitter weather as it has been to-day, with only that flimsy white gown and those thin slippers!”

“My dear husband,”said his wife,“I know no more about the little thing than you do. Some neighbor's child, I suppose. Our Violet and Peony,”she added, laughing at herself for repeating so absurd a story,“insist that she is nothing but a snow-image, which they have been busy about in the garden, almost all the afternoon.”

As she said this, the mother glanced her eyes toward the spot where the children's snow-image had been made. What was her surprise, on perceiving that there was not the slightest trace of so much labor!—no image at all!—no piled up heap of snow!—nothing whatever, save the prints of little footsteps around a vacant space!

“This is very strange!”said she.

“What is strange, dear mother?”asked Violet.“Dear father, do not you see how it is? This is our snow-image, which Peony and I have made, because we wanted another playmate. Did not we, Peony?”

“Yes, papa,”said crimson Peony.“This be our 'ittle snow-sister. Is she not beau-ti-ful? But she gave me such a cold kiss!”

“Poh, nonsense, children!”cried their good, honest father, who, as we have already intimated, had an exceedingly common-sensible way of looking at matters.“Do not tell me of making live figures out of snow. Come, wife; this little stranger must not stay out in the bleak air a moment longer. We will bring her into the parlor; and you shall give her a supper of warm bread and milk, and make her as comfortable as you can. Meanwhile, I will inquire among the neighbors; or, if necessary, send the city-crier about the streets, to give notice of a lost child.”

So saying, this honest and very kind-hearted man was going toward the little white damsel, with the best intentions in the world. But Violet and Peony, each seizing their father by the hand, earnestly besought him not to make her come in.

“Dear father,”cried Violet, putting herself before him,“it is true what I have been telling you! This is our little snow-girl, and she cannot live any longer than while she breathes the cold west-wind. Do not make her come into the hot room!”

“Yes, father,”shouted Peony, stamping his little foot, so mightily was he in earnest,“this be nothing but our 'ittle snow-child! She will not love the hot fire!”

“Nonsense, children, nonsense, nonsense!”cried the father, half vexed, half laughing at what he considered their foolish obstinacy.“Run into the house, this moment! It is too late to play any longer, now. I must take care of this little girl immediately, or she will catch her death-a-cold!”

“Husband! dear husband!”said his wife, in a low voice,—for she had been looking narrowly at the snow-child, and was more perplexed than ever,—“there is something very singular in all this. You will think me foolish,—but—but—may it not be that some invisible angel has been attracted by the simplicity and good faith with which our children set about their undertaking? May he not have spent an hour of his immortality in playing with those dear little souls? and so the result is what we call a miracle. No, no! Do not laugh at me; I see what a foolish thought it is!”

“My dear wife,”replied the husband, laughing heartily,“you are as much a child as Violet and Peony.”

And in one sense so she was, for all through life she had kept her heart full of childlike simplicity and faith, which was as pure and clear as crystal; and, looking at all matters through this transparent medium, she sometimes saw truths so profound that other people laughed at them as nonsense and absurdity.

But now kind Mr. Lindsey had entered the garden, breaking away from his two children, who still sent their shrill voices after him, beseeching him to let the snow-child stay and enjoy herself in the cold west-wind. As he approached, the snow-birds took to flight. The little white damsel, also, fled backward, shaking her head, as if to say,“Pray, do not touch me!”and roguishly, as it appeared, leading him through the deepest of the snow. Once, the good man stumbled, and floundered down upon his face, so that, gathering himself up again, with the snow sticking to his rough pilot-cloth sack, he looked as white and wintry as a snow-image of the largest size. Some of the neighbors, meanwhile, seeing him from their windows, wondered what could possess poor Mr. Lindsey to be running about his garden in pursuit of a snow-drift, which the west-wind was driving hither and thither! At length, after a vast deal of trouble, he chased the little stranger into a corner, where she could not possibly escape him. His wife had been looking on, and, it being nearly twilight, was wonder-struck to observe how the snow-child gleamed and sparkled, and how she seemed to shed a glow all round about her; and when driven into the corner, she positively glistened like a star! It was a frosty kind of brightness, too, like that of an icicle in the moonlight. The wife thought it strange that good Mr. Lindsey should see nothing remarkable in the snow-child's appearance.

“Come, you odd little thing!”cried the honest man, seizing her by the hand,“I have caught you at last, and will make you comfortable in spite of yourself. We will put a nice warm pair of worsted stockings on your frozen little feet, and you shall have a good thick shawl to wrap yourself in. Your poor white nose, I am afraid, is actually frost-bitten. But we will make it all right. Come along in.”

And so, with a most benevolent smile on his sagacious visage, all purple as it was with the cold, this very well-meaning gentleman took the snow-child by the hand and led her towards the house. She followed him, droopingly and reluctant; for all the glow and sparkle was gone out of her figure; and whereas just before she had resembled a bright, frosty, star-gemmed evening, with a crimson gleam on the cold horizon, she now looked as dull and languid as a thaw. As kind Mr. Lindsey led her up the steps of the door, Violet and Peony looked into his face,—their eyes full of tears, which froze before they could run down their cheeks,—and again entreated him not to bring their snow-image into the house.

“Not bring her in!”exclaimed the kind-hearted man.“Why, you are crazy, my little Violet!—quite crazy, my small Peony! She is so cold, already, that her hand has almost frozen mine, in spite of my thick gloves. Would you have her freeze to death?”

His wife, as he came up the steps, had been taking another long, earnest, almost awe-stricken gaze at the little white stranger. She hardly knew whether it was a dream or no; but she could not help fancying that she saw the delicate print of Violet's fingers on the child's neck. It looked just as if, while Violet was shaping out the image, she had given it a gentle pat with her hand, and had neglected to smooth the impression quite away.

“After all, husband,”said the mother, recurring to her idea that the angels would be as much delighted to play with Violet and Peony as she herself was,—“after all, she does look strangely like a snow-image! I do believe she is made of snow!”

A puff of the west-wind blew against the snow-child, and again she sparkled like a star.

“Snow!”repeated good Mr. Lindsey, drawing the reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold.“No wonder she looks like snow. She is half frozen, poor little thing! But a good fire will put everything to rights!”

Without further talk, and always with the same best intentions, this highly benevolent and common-sensible individual led the little white damsel—drooping, drooping, drooping, more and more out of the frosty air, and into his comfortable parlor. A Heidenberg stove, filled to the brim with intensely burning anthracite, was sending a bright gleam through the isinglass of its iron door, and causing the vase of water on its top to fume and bubble with excitement. A warm, sultry smell was diffused throughout the room. A thermometer on the wall farthest from the stove stood at eighty degrees. The parlor was hung with red curtains, and covered with a red carpet, and looked just as warm as it felt. The difference betwixt the atmosphere here and the cold, wintry twilight out of doors, was like stepping at once from Nova Zembla to the hottest part of India, or from the North Pole into an oven. Oh, this was a fine place for the little white stranger!

The common-sensible man placed the snow-child on the hearth-rug, right in front of the hissing and fuming stove.

“Now she will be comfortable!”cried Mr. Lindsey, rubbing his hands and looking about him, with the pleasantest smile you ever saw.“Make yourself at home, my child.”

Sad, sad and drooping, looked the little white maiden, as she stood on the hearth-rug, with the hot blast of the stove striking through her like a pestilence. Once, she threw a glance wistfully toward the windows, and caught a glimpse, through its red curtains, of the snow-covered roofs, and the stars glimmering frostily, and all the delicious intensity of the cold night. The bleak wind rattled the window-panes, as if it were summoning her to come forth. But there stood the snow-child, drooping, before the hot stove!

But the common-sensible man saw nothing amiss.

“Come wife,”said he,“let her have a pair of thick stockings and a woollen shawl or blanket directly; and tell Dora to give her some warm supper as soon as the milk boils. You, Violet and Peony, amuse your little friend. She is out of spirits, you see, at finding herself in a strange place. For my part, I will go around among the neighbors, and find out where she belongs.”

The mother, meanwhile, had gone in search of the shawl and stockings; for her own view of the matter, however subtle and delicate, had given way, as it always did, to the stubborn materialism of her husband. Without heeding the remonstrances of his two children, who still kept murmuring that their little snow-sister did not love the warmth, good Mr. Lindsey took his departure, shutting the parlor-door carefully behind him. Turning up the collar of his sack over his ears, he emerged from the house, and had barely reached the street-gate, when he was recalled by the screams of Violet and Peony, and the rapping of a thimbled finger against the parlor window.

“Husband! husband!”cried his wife, showing her horror-stricken face through the window-panes.“There is no need of going for the child's parents!”

“We told you so, father!”screamed Violet and Peony, as he re-entered the parlor.“You would bring her in; and now our poor— dear-beau-ti-ful little snow-sister is thawed!”

And their own sweet little faces were already dissolved in tears; so that their father, seeing what strange things occasionally happen in this every-day world, felt not a little anxious lest his children might be going to thaw too! In the utmost perplexity, he demanded an explanation of his wife. She could only reply, that, being summoned to the parlor by the cries of Violet and Peony, she found no trace of the little white maiden, unless it were the remains of a heap of snow, which, while she was gazing at it, melted quite away upon the hearth-rug.

“And there you see all that is left of it!”added she, pointing to a pool of water in front of the stove.

“Yes, father,”said Violet looking reproachfully at him, through her tears,“there is all that is left of our dear little snow-sister!”

“Naughty father!”cried Peony, stamping his foot, and—I shudder to say—shaking his little fist at the common-sensible man.“We told you how it would be! What for did you bring her in?”

And the Heidenberg stove, through the isinglass of its door, seemed to glare at good Mr. Lindsey, like a red-eyed demon, triumphing in the mischief which it had done!

This, you will observe, was one of those rare cases, which yet will occasionally happen, where common-sense finds itself at fault. The remarkable story of the snow-image, though to that sagacious class of people to whom good Mr. Lindsey belongs it may seem but a childish affair, is, nevertheless, capable of being moralized in various methods, greatly for their edification. One of its lessons, for instance, might be, that it behooves men, and especially men of benevolence, to consider well what they are about, and, before acting on their philanthropic purposes, to be quite sure that they comprehend the nature and all the relations of the business in hand. What has been established as an element of good to one being may prove absolute mischief to another; even as the warmth of the parlor was proper enough for children of flesh and blood, like Violet and Peony,—though by no means very wholesome, even for them,—but involved nothing short of annihilation to the unfortunate snow-image.

But, after all, there is no teaching anything to wise men of good Mr. Lindsey's stamp. They know everything,—oh, to be sure!— everything that has been, and everything that is, and everything that, by any future possibility, can be. And, should some phenomenon of nature or providence transcend their system, they will not recognize it, even if it come to pass under their very noses.

“Wife,”said Mr. Lindsey, after a fit of silence,“see what a quantity of snow the children have brought in on their feet! It has made quite a puddle here before the stove. Pray tell Dora to bring some towels and mop it up!”
