PRIDE AND PREJUDICE





Jane Austen





Jane Austen (1775—1817) was born in Steventon, Hampshire, England. Her education was mainly conducted within her family. She wrote six novels in her life. They center on the lives of young women of the middle class, and every novel ends with a happy marriage or two. As an unmarried woman of very modest financial means, Jane Austen understood the hopes and fears of women who had to rely on marriage and family connections to provide them with a home and means to live.





内容简介


Pride and Prejudice was first published in 1813. The story follows the main character Elizabeth Bennet as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of early 19th-century England. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman, living near the fictional town of Meryton in Hertfordshire, near London. She dislikes Darcy, the wealthy owner of the famous family estate Pamberley, because Darcy shows pride and mistreats his friend Wickham in her own thought. Thanks to a letter written by Darcy, who communicates with her and helps her little sister, Elizabeth understands him and accepts his love at last. Meanwhile, her sister Jane marries Darcy's friend Mr Bingley. The story ends with happiness of main characters.

Chapter I


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of someone or other of their daughters.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.

"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

This was invitation enough.

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"What is his name?"

"Bingley."

"Is he married or single?"

"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"

"How so? How can it affect them?"

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."

"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."

"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for, as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."

"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."

"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him, if you do not."

"You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."

"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."

"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."

"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves."

"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."

"Ah! You do not know what I suffer."

"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

"It will be no use to us if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."

"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty I will visit them all."

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.





Chapter II


Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with,

"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."

"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."

"But you forget, Mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him."

"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."

"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill."

"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.

"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

"Tomorrow fortnight."

"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."

"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."

"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"

"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."

The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"

"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts."

Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr. Bingley."

"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.

"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.

"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved our girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now."

"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so pleasant I can tell you, to be making new acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."

"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest."

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.





Chapter III


Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises—but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.

"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a large number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the oldest, and another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it.

"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance."

"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."

"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them, you see, uncommonly pretty."

"You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."

"Which do you mean?" and turning round, he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, "She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."

Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.

"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of that my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger—"

"If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. Oh! that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"

"Oh! my dear," continued Mrs. Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown—"

Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs. I quite detest the man."





Chapter IV


When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.

"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."

"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment."

"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other women in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."

"Dear Lizzy!"

"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life."

"I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think."

"I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough—one meets it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man's sisters too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his."

"Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced. Their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies, not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.

His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.





Chapter V


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet.—They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

"You began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. "You were Mr. Bingley's first choice."

"Yes;—but he seemed to like his second better."

"Oh!—you mean Jane, I suppose—because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr. Robinson."

"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? And his answering immediately to the last question—'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"

"Upon my word!—Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."

"My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza," said Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable."

"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips."

"Are you quite sure, Ma'am?—Is not there a little mistake?" said Jane. "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."

"Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;—but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to."

"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance. With them he is remarkably agreeable."

"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is ate up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."

"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza."

"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with him, if I were you."

"I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him."

"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud."

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."

"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."

"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly."

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.





Chapter VI


The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her; and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.

"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."

"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too."

"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."

"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."

"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses."

"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."

"Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal."

"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-et-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."

"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him tomorrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelve-month. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always contrive to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."

"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.

"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"

"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."

"But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,

"Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"

"With great energy;—but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic."

"You are severe on us."

"It will be her turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. "I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."

"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—Always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!—If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with—'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'—and I shall keep mine to swell my song."

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.

"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!—There is nothing like dancing after all.—I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies."

"Certainly, Sir;—and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage can dance."

Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;—"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."

"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir."

"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?"

"Never, Sir."

"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"

"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place, if I can avoid it."

"You have a house in town, I conclude?"

Mr. Darcy bowed.

"I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her,

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing?—Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.—You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you." And taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,

"Indeed, Sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."

Mr. Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand; but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour."

"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.

"He is indeed—but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley.

"I can guess the subject of your reverie."

"I should imagine not."

"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!—What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"

"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray when am I to wish you joy?"

"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."

"Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you."

He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.





Chapter VII


Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mothers fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head-quarters.

Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.

After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed:

"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."

Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.

"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."

"If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it."

"Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."

"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."

"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."

"Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."

Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read:

"Well, Jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."

"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.


My dear Friend,

If you are not so compassionate as to dine today with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.

Yours ever,

Caroline Bingley.



"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that."

"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."

"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.

"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."

"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."

"Oh! But the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."

"I had much rather go in the coach."

"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?"

"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."

"But if you have got them today," said Elizabeth, "my mothers purpose will be answered."

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.

"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:


My dearest Lizzy,

I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.

Yours,

Jane



"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."

"Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long is she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage."

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.

"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."

"I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want."

"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"

"No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."

"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."

"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.

"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."

In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.—Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.

Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.

When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters, and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.

When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.





Chapter VIII


At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves, and then thought no more of the matter; and their indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.

Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,

"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild."

"She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!"

"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office."

"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley, "but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."

"You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley, "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition."

"Certainly not."

"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum."

"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.

"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."

"Not at all," he replied, "they were brightened by the exercise."—A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.

"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."

"I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton."

"Yes, and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."

"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."

"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer, but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs her-self. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he, "that is rather singular."

"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else."

"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth, "I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."

"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley, "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well."

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.

"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into."

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.

"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"

"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."

"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."

"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."

"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."

"I wish it may."

"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."

"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."

"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."

"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."

Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game.

"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley, "will she be as tall as I am?"

"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller."

"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite."

"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."

"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"

"Yes all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."

"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."

"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.

"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."

"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."

"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished, who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved."

"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."

"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any."

"Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?"

"I never saw such a woman, I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.

"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own, and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."

"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of, but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.





Chapter IX


Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her, that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."

"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."

"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us."

Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world—which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease."

"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."

"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.

"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.

"Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly."

"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."

"That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."

"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study."

"Yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage."

"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."

"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them forever."

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."

Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.

"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?"

"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."

"Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."

"Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."

"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four and twenty families."

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.

"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley—is not he? So much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."

"Did Charlotte dine with you?"

"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend."

"She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.

"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."

"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"

"I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said Darcy.

"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."

Darcy only smiled, and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part, indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear.

"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement, and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill."

Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."

Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behavior to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.





Chapter X


The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room. The loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"

He made no answer.

"You write uncommonly fast."

"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."

"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!"

"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours."

"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."

"I have already told her so once, by your desire."

"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well."

"Thank you—but I always mend my own."

"How can you contrive to write so even?"

He was silent.

"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."

"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?—At present I have not room to do them justice."

"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"

"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine."

"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill."

"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother, "because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables.—Do not you, Darcy?"

"My style of writing is very different from yours."

"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."

"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."

"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."

"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."

"And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"

"The indirect boast—for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"

"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."

"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and, at another word, might stay a month."

"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself."

"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."

"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"

"Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself."

"You expect me to account for opinions which you Choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."

"To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."

"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."

"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"

"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"

"By all means," cried Bingley; "Let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."

Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.

"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."

"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."

"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter."

Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine however, at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her—

"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"

She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.

"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have therefore made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare."

"Indeed I do not dare."

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.—And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."

"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"

"Oh! yes.—Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great uncle, the judge. They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"

"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."

At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.

"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.

"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out." Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three.

Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said:

"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue."

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:

"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Goodbye."

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.





Chapter XI


When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and, seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object. Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad"; but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.

When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brothers conversation with Miss Bennet.

Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said: "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book!—When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."

No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said,

"By the by, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?—I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup—enough I shall send round my cards."

"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day."

"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."

Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;—but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and turning to Elizabeth, said:

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.—I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. "What could he mean?" she was dying to know what could be his meaning—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?

"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.

"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. "You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;—if the first, I should be completely in your way;—and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."

"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"

"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him.—Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."

"But upon my honour I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no—I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself."

"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a laugh."

"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."

"Certainly," replied Elizabeth—"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.—But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."

"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."

"Such as vanity and pride."

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley; "and pray what is the result?"

"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise."

"No—" said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for.—It is I believe too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for ever."

"That is a failing indeed!—"cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it; you are safe from me."

"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."

"And your defect is a propensity to hate everybody."

"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them."

"Do let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. "Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst."

Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.





Chapter XII


In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added that, if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.—Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day, to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.—But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.





Chapter XIII


"I hope my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner today, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."

"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."

"The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger."

Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure. Why Jane—you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.—But—good Lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got today. Lydia, my love, ring the bell. I must speak to Hill, this moment."

"It is not Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained. "About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."

"Oh! My dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."

Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."

"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father did before him?"

"Why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."





Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,

15th October.


Dear Sir,

The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.





"There, Mrs. Bennet."





My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday sennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters. Your well-wisher and friend,

William Collins



"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peacemaking gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."

"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."

Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.

"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.—Can he be a sensible man, sir?"

"No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him."

"In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet, indeed, said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs. Bennet who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily:

"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly."

"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."

"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things, I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."

"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,—and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted—"

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too, in its turn, was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.





Chapter XIV


During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,—some shelves in the closets upstairs.

"That is all very proper and civil I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"

"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."

"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?"

"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."

"Ah!" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?"

"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."

"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."

"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."

"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"

"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."

Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.

By teatime, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.—Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.—Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:

"Do you know, Mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton tomorrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:

"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess;—for certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."

Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.





Chapter XV


Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to Choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their fathers estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them.—Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.—"As to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession;—her eldest daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.

Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty—a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it?—It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Philips' throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.

Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden returning home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the —shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows". Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins, on his return, highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Philips's manners and politeness. He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.





Chapter XVI


As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the —shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.

When the card-tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.

"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life—" Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand."

"Yes," replied Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself—for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.—Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"

"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth warmly, "I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."

"I have no right to give my opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.—Here you are in your own family."

"Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone."

"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."

"I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.

"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."

"I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the —shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."

"Oh! No—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.

"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the —shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."

"Indeed!"

"Yes—The late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."

"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could that be?—How could his will be disregarded?—Why did not you seek legal redress?"

"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."

"This is quite shocking!—He deserves to be publicly disgraced."

"Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him."

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.

"But what," said she after a pause, "can have been his motive?—what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"

"A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his fathers uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me."

"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him—I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"

After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful."

"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham. "I can hardly be just to him."

Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!"—She could have added, "A young man too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"—but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"

"We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence, and when immediately before my fathers death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of affection to myself."

"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable!—I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!—If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest, for dishonesty I must call it."

"It is wonderful,"—replied Wickham,—"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;—and pride has often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride."

"Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"

"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous,—to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."

"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"

He shook his head.—"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother,—very, very proud.—As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her fathers death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other?—Do you know Mr. Bingley?"

"Not at all."

"He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is."

"Probably not;—but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversable companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,—allowing something for fortune and figure."

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.

"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chance of these things,—and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."

Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."

"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."

"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."

"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.

"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."

"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who Chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr. Collins—in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins—had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.





Chapter XVII


Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;—she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.—The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.

"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."

"Very true, indeed;—and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?—Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."

"Laugh as much as you Choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner,—one, whom his father had promised to provide for.—It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."

"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.—If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks."

"It is difficult indeed—it is distressing.—One does not know what to think."

"I beg your pardon;—one knows exactly what to think."

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,—that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card; Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attention of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's looks and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.

"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.—I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody."

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion that, though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and, if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.

"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,—a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her."

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:—and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help for it however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more.—It now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her. Elizabeth, however, did not Choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.





Chapter XVIII


Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,

"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here."

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.—Attention, for-bearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.

"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."

"Heaven forbid!—That would be the greatest misfortune of all!—To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!—Do not wish me such an evil."

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with,

"It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.—I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."

He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.

"Very well.—That reply will do for the present.—Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.—But now we may be silent."

"Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"

"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."

"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"

"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.—We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the éclat of a proverb."

"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he. "How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say.—You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."

"I must not decide on my own performance."

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added: "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."

The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur over-spread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said:

"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain."

"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.

"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, Sir.—You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also up-braiding me."

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,

"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."

"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.—We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.

"Books—Oh! No.—I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."

"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.—We may compare our different opinions."

"No—I cannot talk of books in a ballroom; my head is always full of something else."

"The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.

"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created."

"I am," said he, with a firm voice.

"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"

"I hope not."

"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."

"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

"Merely to the illustration of your character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."

"And what is your success?"

She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."

"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."

"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."

"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.

They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her:

"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!—Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy, in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all, is a most insolent thing indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favorite's guilt; but really, considering his descent one could not expect much better."

"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself."

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. "Excuse my interference.—It was kindly meant."

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.—"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.

"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case you may be sure of my pardon."

"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."

"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"

"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."

"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"

"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only."

"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before."

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.

"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with—perhaps—a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!—I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."

"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?"

"Indeed I am. I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight."

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.—Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."— It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her, in idea, settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.—It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette, but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear."

"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.—What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy?—You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing."

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.

At length however Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,—but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.—Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud:

"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her fathers speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.—Others of the party were now applied to.

"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.—I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do.—In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.—Many stared.—Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most press-ingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.

Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.





Chapter XIX


The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:

"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"

Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered:

"Oh dear!—Yes—certainly.—I am sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection.—Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs." And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:

"Dear Ma'am, do not go.—I beg you will not go.— Mr. Collins must excuse me.—He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself."

"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.—I desire you will stay where you are."—And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.

"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mothers permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:

"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances—like myself—to set the example of matrimony in his parish. Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier—that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion—unasked too!—on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry.—Choose properly, Choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father—who, however, may live many years longer—I could not satisfy myself without resolving to Choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents, which will not be yours till after your mothers decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without farther loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me, I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."

"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."

"Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies—if such young ladies there are— who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.—You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so.—Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."

"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins very gravely—"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications."

"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,

"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."

"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one."

"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in its favor; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall Choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."

"I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart."

"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception, Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.





Chapter XX


Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had stedfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;—she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.

"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will make her know it."

"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."

"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library,

"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her."

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.

"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"

"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."

"And what am I to do on the occasion?—It seems an hopeless business."

"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."

"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.

"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was. "Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?"

"I have, Sir."

"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?"

"Yes, or I will never see her again."

"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.—Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do."

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me to insist upon her marrying him."

"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;—and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!—What do you think has happened this morning?—Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."

Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."

Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.—But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.—I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you.—I have done with you from this very day.—I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children,—not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer!—But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied."

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,

"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together."

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation.—"Oh! Mr. Collins!"

"My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all, the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."





Chapter XXI


The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody was well talked over.—To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.

"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;—that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said:

"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says."

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words.


I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.



To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?—Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them."

"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you—"


When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.



"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."

"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he should."

"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.—He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you."


Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?



"What think you of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?"—said Jane as she finished it. "Is it not clear enough?—Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means—most kindly!—to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"

"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.—Will you hear it?"

"Most willingly."

"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."

Jane shook her head.

"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.—No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."

"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself."

"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."

"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"

"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."

"How can you talk so?"—said Jane faintly smiling.—"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."

"I did not think you would;—and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.





Chapter XXII


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;—its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception however was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.

Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still, he would be her husband.—Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.

"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."

They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,

"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?—You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness."

"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."

"You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence."

"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:

"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte,—impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?—Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.

"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,—"you must be surprised, very much surprised,—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."

Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"—and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture!—And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.





Chapter XXIII


Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,

"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?—Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.

Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.—It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.—She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take my place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate, If it was not for the entail I should not mind it."

"What should not you mind?"

"I should not mind anything at all."

"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."

"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!— Why should he have it more than anybody else?"

"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.





Chapter XXIV


Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.

Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others. To Caroline's assertion of her brothers being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as, she thought, he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,

"Oh! That my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.

"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time therefore.—I shall certainly try to get the better."

With a stronger voice she soon added: "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself."

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "You are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.

"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!"

"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."

"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness."

"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does."

"And men take care that they should."

"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."

"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."

"And do you impute it to either of those?"

"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."

"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?"

"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."

"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."

"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."

"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to Choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."

"Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."

"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."

Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.





Chapter XXV


After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done, she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.

"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could. But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."

"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."

"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?"

"I never saw a more promising inclination. He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"

"Oh, yes!—Of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything."

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.

"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."

"And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London—! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him."

"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with the sister? She will not be able to help calling."

"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.

The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here, consequently, was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.





Chapter XXVI


Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is—you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."

"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."

"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."

"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."

"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."

"I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not, I see the imprudence of it.—Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy!—My fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honor; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."

"Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him."

"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied."

Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "wished they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.

As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:

"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."

"That you certainly shall."

"And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?"

"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."

"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.

"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them."

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.

"My aunt," she continued, "is going tomorrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall soon see them here."

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt:


My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it, I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy: your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.

Yours, Jane



This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of someone else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:—"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain."





Chapter XXVII


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.

"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."

"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."

"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think."

"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."

"But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune."

"No—why should he? If it was not allowable for him to gain my affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"

"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."

"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object to it, why should we?"

"Her not objecting, does not justify him. It only shows her being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling."

"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."

"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."

"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going tomorrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."

"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes."

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we have gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."





Chapter XXVIII


Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high-road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernable. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared that they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at a small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the excercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed:

"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."

"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."

"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out:

"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment."

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.

"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!"

"La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"

"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?"

"Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in."

"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She looks sickly and cross.—Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife."

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.





Chapter XXIX


Mr. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there—an invitation moreover including the whole party—so immediately after your arrival!"

"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."

Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day, or next morning, but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.—Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.

From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin, and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

When the ladies returned to the drawing room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mothers maiden name?—Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.—Lady Catherine then observed:

"Your fathers estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.—It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.—Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"

"A little."

"Oh! Then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to—You shall try it some day.—Do your sisters play and sing?"

"One of them does."

"Why did not you all learn?—You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours.—Do you draw?"

"No, not at all."

"What, none of you?"

"Not one."

"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."

"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."

"Has your governess left you?"

"We never had any governess."

"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!—I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."

Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.

"Then, who taught you? Who attended to you? Without a governess you must have been neglected."

"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."

"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"

"Yes, Ma'am, all."

"All!—What, all five out at once? Very odd!—And you only the second.—The younger ones out before the elder are married!—Your younger sisters must be very young?"

"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.—The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive!—I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."

"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.—Pray, what is your age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence!

"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,—therefore you need not conceal your age."

"I am not one and twenty."

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table, Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands.





Chapter XXX


Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.

Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses' reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.

In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.

His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord —; and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them, from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:

"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."

Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the doorbell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added:

"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?"

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.





Chapter XXXI


Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out.

"What is that you arc saying. Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."

"We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.

"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"

Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.

"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."

"I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly."

"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano forte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:

"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? But I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."

"I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam: "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear."

"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.

"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."

"You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you—but so it was. He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."

"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."

"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."

"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."

"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"

"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."

"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."

"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I would not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."

Darcy smiled, and said: "You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:

"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.





Chapter XXXII


Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.

They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergency recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:

"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."

"Perfectly so—I thank you."

She found that she was to receive no other answer—and, after a short pause, added:

"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"

"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."

"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle."

"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."

Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.

He took the hint, and soon began with: "This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."

"I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."

"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."

"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."

"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."

"An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."

"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance."

"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family."

"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."

As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:

"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."

Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said: "You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn."

Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:

"Are you pleased with Kent?"

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk. The tête-à-tête surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.

"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. "My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way."

But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.—She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.

In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.





Chapter XXXIII


More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers.—How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd!—Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.

She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:

"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."

"I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"

"No, I should have turned in a moment."

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage together.

"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.

"Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases."

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."

"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?"

"These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like."

"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."

"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."

"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,

"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."

"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."

As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:

"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."

"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man—he is a great friend of Darcy's."

"Oh! Yes," said Elizabeth drily—"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."

"Care of him!—Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."

"What is it you mean?"

"It is a circumstance which Darcy, of course, would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."

"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."

"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."

"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"

"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."

"And what arts did he use to separate them?"

"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam, smiling. "He only told me what I have now told you."

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.

"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"

"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"

"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."

"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."

This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.

"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.

"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection. All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.





Chapter XXXIV


When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do.

She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:

"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."

Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed. He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,

"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,

"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."

"I might as well enquire," replied she, "why, with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.

"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied: "I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself."

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? Or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?"

"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"

"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "Yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."

"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! And yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule."

"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination—by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:

"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,

"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,

"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."

"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."

And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

The tumult of her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.

She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her way to her room.





Chapter XXXV


Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else, and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure: "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"—And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.—The envelope itself was likewise full.—Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:—


Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.

Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister;—and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.—Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.—But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.—If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry.—The necessity must be obeyed—and farther apology would be absurd.—I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country.—But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.—I had often seen him in love before.—At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.—Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.—If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.—If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.—That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,—but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.—I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it;—I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.—My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.—But there were other causes of repugnance;—causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.—These causes must be stated, though briefly.—The situation of your mothers family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly, betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.— Pardon me.—It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.—I will only say farther that, from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.—He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.—The part which I acted is now to be explained.—His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.—We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.—I described, and enforced them earnestly.—But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal, regard.—But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.—To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.—I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.—That they might have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable;—but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.—Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.—It is done, however, and it was done for the best.—On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.—With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me, I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge;—most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and, if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself. After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not, perhaps, to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.

Fitzwilliam Darcy.





Chapter XXXVI


If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and stedfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming: "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving, in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on. But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the —shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! The story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.

She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips's. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that, proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits. That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling. That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.—Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.

"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.—"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!—I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.—How humiliating is this discovery!—Yet, how just a humiliation!—Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly.—Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either was concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself."

From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.—How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?—He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;—and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.— Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.—She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned, in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.

The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;—and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.—Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object. She could think only of her letter.





Chapter XXXVII


The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she have said?—how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.—"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!—They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year. His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases."

Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,

"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."

"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.—I must be in town next Saturday."

"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."

"But my father cannot.—He wrote last week to hurry my return."

"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.—Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."

"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."

Lady Catherine seemed resigned.

"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.—Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.—Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.—I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."

"My uncle is to send a servant for us."

"Oh!—Your uncle!—He keeps a man-servant, does he?—I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things. Where shall you change horses?—Oh! Bromley, of course.—If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her, or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.

Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier charging. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.

Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!

When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.





Chapter XXXVIII


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied:

"It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.

"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other."

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung. Poor Charlotte!—It was melancholy to leave her to such society!—But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.

"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."

Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.

"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, "It seems but a day or two since we first came!—And yet how many things have happened!"

"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.

"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!"

Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal."

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister farther.





Chapter XXXIX


It was the second week in May in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of — in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room upstairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming: "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"

"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then showing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern: "Oh! But there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the —shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."

"Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want Papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"

"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "that would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."

"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table. "What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like."

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,

"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe."

"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."

"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."

"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.

"I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her. Who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.

"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia. "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! We had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Foster's. Kitty and I were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening—by the by, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!—and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,—only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it but Col. and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! How I laughed! And so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."

With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.

Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:

"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them. Lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria, across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.

"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"

To this, Mary very gravely replied: "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me. I should infinitely prefer a book."

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.





Chapter XL


Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.

"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment."

"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"

"Blame you! Oh, no."

"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."

"No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."

"But you will know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day."

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one without involving the other.

"This will not do," said Elizabeth. "You never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you choose."

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."

"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."

"Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner."

"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."

"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do."

"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."

"Lizzy when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."

"Indeed I could not. I was uncomfortable enough. I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"

"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."

"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character."

Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied: "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?"

"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it."

"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate."

The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbad the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.

"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Philips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know."

"I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."

"Oh, well! It is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done."

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.

"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say."

"No, nothing at all."

"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. They will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."

"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."

"No. It would have been strange if they had. But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."





Chapter XLI


The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.

"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.

"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart."

"I am sure I shall break mine," said Lydia.

"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.

"Oh, yes!—If one could but go to Brighton! But Papa is so disagreeable."

"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever."

"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good," added Kitty.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn house. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,

"Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."

"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."

"Already arisen!" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."

"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse me—for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous. A flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads.—Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"

Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance, even as a common flirt, than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life."

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.

Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.

Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.

Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that, however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he was acquainted with the former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"

"Nearly three weeks."

"And you saw him frequently?"

"Yes, almost every day."

"His manners are very different from his cousin's."

"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance."

"Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And pray may I ask—?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add out of civility to his ordinary style? for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."

"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,

"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."

Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:

"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.





Chapter XLII


Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had, very early in their marriage, put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort, for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found what had been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by my carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."

When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War-Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.

The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that county, there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.

Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."

The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt, "a place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."

Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country."

Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer. A most welcome negative followed the last question—and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.

To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.





Chapter XLIII


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road, with some abruptness, wound. It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;—and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counter-acted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.

The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene—the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it—with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.—But no,"—recollecting herself,—"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me. I should not have been allowed to invite them."

This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something like regret.

She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding: "but we expect him tomorrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense.—"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.

"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago."

"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."

Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.

"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"

Elizabeth coloured, and said—"A little."

"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"

"Yes, very handsome."

"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them."

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.

Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.

"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr. Gardiner.

"Oh! Yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she comes here tomorrow with him."

Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.

"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

"Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."

"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."

"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."

"Yes, Sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."

"I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."

This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,

"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master."

"Yes, Sir, I know I am. If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed that they who are good-natured when children are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world."

Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy!" thought she.

"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.

"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the poor."

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived. Not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men."

"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.

"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."

"Perhaps we might be deceived."

"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."

On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.

"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight when she should enter the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added. "Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her."

The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.

In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life-time.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!—How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!—How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.

As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.

She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.

At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.

The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! Why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,—what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—But to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.

At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mis-chievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion."

The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating: "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me, it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me."

After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected—"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They will join me early tomorrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,—Mr. Bingley and his sisters."

Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.

"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you.—Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.

They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. "He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.

"There is something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it."

"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."

"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?"

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.

"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.

"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody, as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But to be sure, the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."

Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.





Chapter XLIV


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.

Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.

Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.

They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen, of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.

Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and manner which gave them meaning.

It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.

Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Miss Bennet to dinner at Pemberley before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.

Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness, and, had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that on his quitting Derbyshire he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude.—Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him; she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley—for she had reached it only to a late breakfast—ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go.—Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.





Chapter XLV


Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows, opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.

Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.

He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;—a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brothers entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the —shire militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family."

In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.

Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."

However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned—no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.

"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable."

Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak she continued:

"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, "She a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit." But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."

"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.





Chapter XLVI


Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:


Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!—Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides!—But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step—and let us rejoice over it—marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."



Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows—it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first:


By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success; no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?—Impossible. I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again tomorrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.



"Oh! Where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed: "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not a moment to lose."

"Good God! What is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough;—you cannot go yourself."

Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.

On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration: "Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?—A glass of wine;—shall I get you one?—You are very ill."

"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length, she spoke again, "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her friends—has eloped;—has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever."

Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it!—I who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt— to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all, all too late now."

"I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved—shocked. But is it certain, absolutely certain?"

"Oh yes!—They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."

"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"

"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.

"When my eyes were opened to his real character.—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched, mistake!"

Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She should neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all—soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said: "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress!—But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley today."

"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.—I know it cannot be long."

He readily assured her of his secrecy—again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared in-comprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.—Oh! how acutely did she now feel it!

She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;—but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy.—Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.—Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;—was it so?"

"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled."

"That is all settled!" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!"

But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.





Chapter XLVII


"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk."

"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it?"

"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"

"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."

"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."

"Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though, for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."

"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him, for her sake, forgo every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishon-ourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my fathers behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do in such a matter."

"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"

"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the —shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it?—susceptibility to her feelings, which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."

"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt."

"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word, that he has neither integrity nor honour, that he is as false and deceitful, as he is insinuating."

"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was amiable and unpretending as we have found her."

"But does Lydia know nothing of this? Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"

"Oh, yes!—That, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the —shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to anyone that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this should ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts."

"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other."

"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention, and consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites."





It may be easily believed that, however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from her mothers apartment, immediately met her.

Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.

"Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well."

"Is my father in town?"

"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word."

"And have you heard from him often?"

"We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention."

"And my mother—How is she? How are you all?"

"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well."

"But you—How are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much you must have gone through!"

Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the drawing room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.

"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."

They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he; "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."

"Oh! My dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she Chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,—that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."

But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.

In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:

"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable—that one false step involves her in endless ruin—that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,—and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour to-wards the undeserving of the other sex."

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject by saying: "But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever."

"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland; when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."

"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

"Yes; but when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."

"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"

"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other many weeks."

"But not before they went to Brighton?"

"No, I believe not."

"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?"

"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."

"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"

"Perhaps it would have been better," replied her sister. "But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."

"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"

"He brought it with him for us to see."

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:


My Dear Harriet,

You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them and sign my name Lydia Wickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good- bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.

Your affectionate friend,

Lydia Bennet



"Oh! Thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that she was serious in the object of her journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! How he must have felt it!"

"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"

"Oh! Jane!" cried Elizabeth. "Was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"

"I do not know.—I hope there was.—But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties."

"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh! that I had been with you! You have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."

"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us."

"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she meant well, but under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."

She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

"He meant, I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham. If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."





Chapter XLVIII


The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.

Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.

Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:

"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person."

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.

She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the —shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter—from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:


My Dear Sir,

I feel myself called upon by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family. And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.

I am, Dear Sir, etc.



Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."

Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.

"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried. "Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"

As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.

The present unhappy state of the family, rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.

When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.

It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that. Who would suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."

"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.

"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough."

"Do you suppose them to be in London?"

"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"

"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.

"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."

Then, after a short silence, he continued: "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.

"This is a parade," cried he, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my night cap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can,—or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."

"I am not going to run away, Papa," said Kitty, fretfully; "if I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."

"You go to Brighton!—I would not trust you so near it as East-Bourne, for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."





Chapter XLIX


Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."

"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."

"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter."

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library—their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said,

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."

Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running, as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out,

"Oh, Papa, what news? what news? Have you heard from my uncle?"

"Yes, I have had a letter from him by express."

"Well, and what news does it bring? Good or bad?"

"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it." Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.

"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about."

Gracechurch Street

Monday, August 2


My Dear Brother,

At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet. It is enough to know they are discovered; I have seen them both—



"Then it is as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!" Elizabeth read on:


I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and, I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this busi-ness, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your com-ing to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us today. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on.

Yours, etc.

Edward. Gardiner.



"Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.— "Can it be possible that he will marry her?"

"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him!" said her sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."

"And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.

"No; but it must be done soon."

Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.

"Oh! My dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is, in such a case."

"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."

"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

"And may I ask—?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."

"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."

"And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!"

"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know: one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him."

"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane. "What do you mean, sir?"

"I mean that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."

"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man; I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this."

"No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship."

"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"

Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!"

"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"

"If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"

"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane. "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."

"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it."

It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood, perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,

"Just as you please."

"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"

"Take whatever you like, and get away."

Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went upstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet; one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried. "This is delightful indeed!—She will be married!—I shall see her again!—She will be married at sixteen!—My good, kind brother!—I knew how it would be—I knew he would manage everything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia!—How merry we shall be together when we meet!"

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money."

"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know, and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy. In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."

She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.

"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Phillips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding."

Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.





Chapter L


Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.

The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant farm house. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband, her misery was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs, but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a "proper situation" for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.

"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."

Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: "Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at Longbourn."

A long dispute followed this declaration, but Mr. Bennet was firm; it soon led to another, and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. A union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.





Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family, and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.





"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General —'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and, I hope, among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information. He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.

Yours,

E. Gardiner.





Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the —shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company—for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire—was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.

"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General —'s regiment."

His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled that, as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme; and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.





Chapter LI


Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at —, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.

They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.

Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.

Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.

There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good-humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.

"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."

Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued: "Oh! mama, do the people hereabouts know I am married today? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."

Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mothers right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister: "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

"Well, mama," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast-room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mama, we did not all go!"

"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"

"Oh, Lord! Yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."

"I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.

"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."

"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.

Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than anybody else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,

"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mama and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"

"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."

"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.

"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."

"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

"Oh, yes!—He was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."

"Oh! Certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."

"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.

"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and—comparatively speaking—a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."

"Not that I shall, though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."

Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.





Chapter LII


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.





Gracechurch Street

Sept. 6.





My Dear Niece,

I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in—street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday; as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure—and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it—your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying —what I was never bold enough to say before— how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.

Yours, very sincerely,

M. Gardiner





The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her—for a woman who had already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.

She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by someone's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.

"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.

"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."

"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better."

"True. Are the others coming out?"

"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."

She replied in the affirmative.

"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you."

"Yes, she did."

"And what did she say?"

"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."

"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,

"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."

"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."

"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."

"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."

"And do you like her?"

"Very much."

"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."

"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."

"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"

"I do not recollect that we did."

"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect."

"How should you have liked making sermons?"

"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"

"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."

"You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember."

"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."

"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."

She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.





Chapter LIII


Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.

"Oh! My dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"

"Oh, Lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."

"Write to me very often, my dear."

"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do."

Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."

The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.

"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."

"This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."

"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.

"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). "Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"

"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butchers, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."

Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,

"I saw you look at me today, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks."

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.

"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave him to himself."

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.

The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you will wait on him of course."

"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.

"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again."

"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did.

As the day of his arrival drew near, "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay a Netherfield is over!"

"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."

Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window—she looked—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.

"There is a gentleman with him, Mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"

"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."

"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. —what's his name. That tall, proud man."

"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—And so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."

Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.

"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.

Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.

Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.

"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?"

She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.

She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.

"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agreed to it.

"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said: 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.

"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the —shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! He has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.

"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days' time.

"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.





Chapter LIV


As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.

"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him."

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."

"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane, take care."

"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"

"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."





They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.

On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.

Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinnertime, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

"If he does not come to me, then," said she, "I shall give him up for ever."

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,

"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them, do we?"

Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!

"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,

"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"

"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."

"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"

"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."

She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.

When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "what say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome. I like them prodigiously."

Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again."

Elizabeth smiled.

"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man."

"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."

"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"

"And how impossible in others!"

"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"

"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."





Chapter LV


A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days' time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."

He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

"Can you come tomorrow?"

Yes, he had no engagement at all for tomorrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,

"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is come.—He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair."

"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago."

"Oh! Hang Kitty! What has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said: "What is the matter, mama? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"

"Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,

"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out,

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."

Elizabeth was forced to go

"We may as well ieave them by themselves you know," said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room."

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.

Mrs Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.

Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes.

But on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.

Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"

Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.

"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! How shall I bear so much happiness!"

She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.

Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.

"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! The happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"

In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.

"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.

"With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say."

He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.

It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said,

"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."

Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.

"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income!"

"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me."

"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more."

Then addressing her daughter: "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.

"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible."

"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for it?"

"It must have been his sisters' doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."

"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."

"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!"

"He made a little mistake' to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.

Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.

"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!"

"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."

The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.





Chapter LVI


One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.

Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth:

"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother."

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

"And that I suppose is one of your sisters."

"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine. "She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."

"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.

"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."

"This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."

Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:

"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well."

"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."

"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."

Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent-looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.

"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:—

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

"Indeed, you are mistaken, madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."

"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."

"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"

"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."

"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."

"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"

"I never heard that it was."

"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"

"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."

"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"

"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."

"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in."

"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."

"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."

"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."

"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?"

"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."

Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,

"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"

"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."

"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."

"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."

"That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."

"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the fathers, from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up."

"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."

"True. You are a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."

"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."

"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"

Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,

"I am not."

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"

"I will make no promise of the kind."

"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require."

"And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."

"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late fathers steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—Of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"

"You can now have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house."

And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.

"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"

"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments."

"You are then resolved to have him?"

"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."

"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."

"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."

"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."

In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,

"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."

"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"

Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.





Chapter LVII


The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.

In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."





The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.

She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest."

The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,

"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins."

"From Mr. Collins! And what can he have to say?"

"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. 'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.'

"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?

"'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.'

"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out.

"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.'

"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!"

Elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.

"Are you not diverted?"

"Oh! Yes. Pray read on."

"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it become apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.'

"That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"

"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!"

"Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.





Chapter LVIII


Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,

"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."

"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."

"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."

"If you will thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you."

Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added: "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."

Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.

They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied: "Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."

"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."

"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."

"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentlcman-like manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."

"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."

"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."

"Oh! Do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."

Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"

She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.

"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."

"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."

"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."

"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."

"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son—for many years an only child—I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves—my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable—allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."

"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"

"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."

"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening!"

"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."

"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"

"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."

"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due."

"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.

"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.

"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.

"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."

"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.

"On the evening before my going to London," said he, "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.

"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"

"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection."

"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."

"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now."

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.





Chapter LIX


"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."

"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged."

Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him."

"You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.

"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain? Forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"

"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"

"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"

"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."

"What do you mean?"

"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry."

"My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know everything that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"

"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."

Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.

"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."

Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.





"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.

As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud: "Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again today?"

"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view."

"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?"

Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying,

"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.





In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her fathers opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means—that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper: "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.

"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?"

"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"

"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."

"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."

"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about."

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months, suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her fathers incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.

"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything: made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way. I shall offer to pay him tomorrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."

Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

"Good gracious! Lord bless me! Only think! Dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! My sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased— so happy. Such a charming man!—So handsome! So tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.

"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it tomorrow."

This was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.

"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's."





Chapter LX


Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could you begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"

"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."

"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"

"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."

"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love."

"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?"

"Dearest Jane! Who could have done less for her, but make a virtue of it by all means? My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"

"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."

"But I was embarrassed."

"And so was I."

"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."

"A man who had felt less, might."

"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do."

"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know everything."

"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?"

"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."

"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her?"

"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."

"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:


I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as you Choose; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world.

Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.

Yours, etc.



Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.


Dear Sir,

I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.

Yours sincerely, etc.



Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brothers in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.

Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Mrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.





Chapter LXI


Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:


My Dear Lizzy,

I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

Yours, etc.



As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

译者序


“静女其姝，俟我于城隅。爱而不见，搔首踟蹰。”如果用《诗经·静女》来描述小说《傲慢与偏见》中达西和伊丽莎白（丽茨）这对情侣彼时彼地炽热的爱情感受，除了将“城隅”改为彭伯里庄园，其余的描述大体还是贴切的。

美丽而聪颖的姑娘丽茨由于成见和误会拒绝了达西的求爱，尔后得知达西高尚的人品懊悔不已，悔过之后才发觉自己深深爱上了达西，但又难以启齿。两颗年轻的心无数次相遇、相随，甚至相伴，却始终没能相撞。两颗心若隐若现，距离时远时近。要说近，邻里之间，一步之遥。要说远，咫尺天涯，形同路人。所以，达西焦虑万状也好，搔首踟蹰也罢，一切尽在不言之中。

人世间饮食男女寻找爱情、向往幸福的权利是上苍的恩赐，谁也不能剥夺。自然，每个人寻求爱情的途径、方式各不相同，有时还要受到某些规范的制约。只有矢志不移的追求者，才能最终获得幸福。英国十八世纪女作家奥斯汀所著《傲慢与偏见》就是讲述这类故事的文学作品。书中讲述四种不同类型的爱情婚姻故事，宾利和简、达西和丽茨的婚姻均是建立在爱情基础之上的，历经磨难，值得称道。而柯林斯和卢卡斯、威克姆与莉迪亚之间，除了金钱欲、享乐欲之外，再就是性欲的冲动。奥斯汀对达西与丽茨的爱情经历进行了浓墨重彩的描写。作家剖开当时英国社会的一个截面，以不同阶层的男女青年感情纠葛为线索，描绘出了一幅通俗的社会风情画。

十八世纪，经历了克伦威尔掀起的革命狂飙洗礼后的英国，依然保留了王室、王权以及贵族阶层的特权，人们恢复了旧日对王公贵族顶礼膜拜、心仪神往的情结。社会生活复归平静、保守的状态，各种等级观念重新渗入社会，影响并左右着社会生活。社会崇尚身世、门第、教养和彬彬有礼的言谈举止，即便是有钱的商人和气壮的财主，路遇高傲的贵族，也会自卑地低头。不同身份的人生活在不同的社会阶层，其生活方式、生活情趣、生活质量各有不同，“鸡犬之声相闻，老死不相往来”，遑论通婚联姻。鲁迅先生曾说：“煤油大王那会知道北京捡煤渣老婆子身受的酸辛，饥区的灾民，大约总不去种兰花，像阔人的老太爷一样，贾府里的焦大，也不爱林妹妹的。”达西和丽茨恰恰生活在不同的社会阶层，因而，他们之间从相识、相知到相爱，经历了一个艰难的过程。横亘在他们面前的，有亲朋的反对、门第的差别、社会舆论的障碍等鸿沟。

丽茨的家境既不贫寒，也不富裕。父亲年轻时贪图美貌而娶了头脑简单的母亲，婚后夫妻双方的生活情趣和志向完全不同，感情出现裂痕。父亲对膝下五个女儿有着养育之恩，同时也玩世不恭而未能恪尽教育职责，以致丽茨的妹妹莉迪亚年纪尚小就行为放荡，有辱门风。丽茨由于环境的磨炼，处事精明，善于察言观色，机智中流露出些许狡黠。在她的潜意识中，有着对高傲的豪门贵族本能的拒斥心理，这是自我保护意识使然。在达西和男友屡屡出现的社交场合中，她频频为姐姐简出谋划策，力促简与宾利结成良缘。至于达西，丽茨除却虚与委蛇外，表现出不屑一顾的神态，并且常常针对达西的傲慢以伶牙俐齿进行反击。

达西初次登场，就以傲慢而冷淡的神情伤害了丽茨，自己却并无觉察。他出身豪门，从小我行我素，不会看人脸色行事。平日里，他讷于言，敏于行，心地善良，为人诚恳，讲求礼仪，乐于助人。这种内热外冷的性格，很容易被人误以为是公子哥的做派。加之达西对丽茨母亲及妹妹莉迪亚的粗俗举止十分反感，从而殃及丽茨，使他对丽茨也产生了偏见。然而，他真正了解了丽茨一泓清泉般的品质之后，毅然抛弃门第观念，冲破姨母和女友的束缚，义无反顾地爱上了丽茨。今天的读者或许以为，达西与丽茨相亲相爱是十分自然的事情，其阻力亦不过是达西姨母及其女友的一把鼻涕一把泪。然而，你一旦对十八世纪英国的等级观念、门第风气等习俗有所了解之后，就会明白达西之举需要多么大的信心和勇气。

大凡描写男女私情，常见的有悲剧手法、喜剧手法，现如今还有朦胧手法，游离于悲喜、爱恨之间。正如一首流行歌所唱：“你问我爱你有多深……月亮代表我的心。”答非所问，环顾左右，趣味横生，妙理无穷。此曲既可以理解为手指一轮皓月对天盟誓，爱得死去活来非此不娶不嫁；又可以理解为身处九月广寒宫，冻得瑟瑟发抖，何来激情爱情。奥斯汀在《傲慢与偏见》中描写爱情，没有采用悲剧手法，也没有采用喜剧手法。她的手法类似今天的“肥皂剧”，场景窄小，情节简单，人物不多。出现在作家笔下的，是一场一场的舞会，是一次又一次的聊天喝茶和一顿又一顿的家宴。没有跌宕起伏的情节，没有大喜大悲的场面。书中多有的，是作家对人物性格的张扬和人物心理活动的描述。这是作家的精明之处，也是其高明之处。

奥斯汀一直生活在中产阶层，谙熟乡间中产阶层家庭平凡而琐碎的生活。她在书中刻意对人物进行性格和心理活动描述，既把人物写得活灵活现，能够博得读者的喜爱，又能不囿于时间和空间，任凭思绪在想象中遨游，犹行云流水，游刃有余，不受任何羁绊。





第一章


单身汉如果手中拥有一笔可观的钱财，势必需要讨房妻室，这已成为举世公认的真理。

这样的单身汉，每逢乔迁新居，左邻右舍对他的感受和观点虽一无所知，但是，既然以上的真理早已在人们的心目中根深蒂固，所以邻居仍总是将其视为自己某一个女儿应该得到的一份财产。

一日，贝内特太太对她的丈夫说：“亲爱的，尼瑟费德别墅终于租出去了，你听说过没有？”

贝内特先生说自己没听说有这档子事。

“这是千真万确的，”她继续侃侃而谈，“朗太太刚刚上这儿来过，把事情原原本本都告诉了我。”

贝内特先生没有答理她。

“你难道不想知道是谁把别墅租了去吗？”贝太太耐不住性子，大声嚷嚷起来。

“既然你打定主意要讲给我听，我也只好洗耳恭听了。”

有了这样一句话，对贝内特太太来说就足够了。

“嗬，亲爱的，你要知道，朗太太说租尼瑟费德别墅的是英格兰北部的一个阔少爷，家里有的是钱；听说星期一那天，他乘坐一辆驷马大车来看过地方，对房子十分满意，当场就和莫里斯先生拍板成交了；他打算在米迦勒结账节之前搬进来，下个周末便派几位仆人来收拾。”

“这人叫什么名字？”

“他叫宾利。”

“是个有妻室的人，还是单身汉？”

“哈！是单身，亲爱的，这可是千真万确的！他是个家底非常殷实的单身男子，每年有四五千镑的进项。咱们的女儿要交好运啦！”

“你净东拉西扯！这与她们有什么关系？”

“我亲爱的老爷，”贝太太说道，“你怎么这样不开窍！实话告诉你吧，我正在盘算着怎样嫁一个女儿给他做太太哩。”

“他搬到这儿来，就为这个目的？”

“要说这是他的目的，那纯粹是不着边际的瞎猜！不过，说不定他真的会爱上咱们的某个女儿呢。所以，他一搬来，你就到他的府上拜访。”

“我到他家算应的哪门子景。你让女儿们自己去得了。要不然你和她们一道去，这样做更好些，因为论姿色你比她们哪个都不差，宾利先生或许会选中你呢。”

“亲爱的，你过分抬举我啦。我以前的确算得上个美人，可现在人老珠黄，没有什么出众之处了。五个女儿都已长大成人，我就更不该炫耀自己的脸蛋了。”

“这么说，一个女人到了这个年龄，值得炫耀的地方已经不多了。”

“亲爱的，说点正经话吧。宾利先生搬来的时候，你必须到他的府上走走。”

“我可以告诉你，我没有那份闲工夫。”

“可你得照顾一下女儿们的情面呀。不妨细想一下，她们当中无论哪一个，只要能结识宾利先生，都是一种造化。就连威廉爵士和卢卡斯夫人都动了念头，决计去拜访他呢。要知道，这两口子对新搬来的邻居通常是不闻不问的。总而言之，你必须去一趟。没有你去铺路，我们无法和他接近。”

“你没有必要拘泥于繁琐的礼节。你尽管去吧，宾利先生见到你一定会大喜过望。我可以写封信由你带去，就说不管他选中我的哪个女儿，我都心甘情愿把女儿嫁给他。不过，在信上我得提提小丽茨[1]的优点，为她说几句好话。”

“但愿你别写糊涂话，因为丽茨不论哪一点都不比别的几个女儿强。我敢说，论脸蛋她还不及简的一半；论性格，她无法与温和的莉迪亚相比。可你老是一味地偏向她。”

“她们和别的姑娘家没什么两样，都是既愚蠢又无知，不值得称赞。只是丽茨比她的几个姐妹伶俐些罢了。”

“贝内特先生，你怎舍得用这样的语言挖苦自己的亲生女儿！你是故意惹我伤心。我的神经原来就脆弱得很，可你一点儿也不体谅。”

“亲爱的，你错怪了我。我和你那神经衰弱症是老相识了，我对它可是怀有十二分敬意的。至少在这二十年来，我屡次三番听到你郑重其事提到它。”

“别卖乖啦！你根本不知道我受的是什么洋罪。”

“不过我衷心希望你无病无灾活下去。像这样年进项在四千镑的阔少爷有的是。你可以大饱眼福，看着他们一个个搬来做你的邻居。”

“你既然不愿意放下架子去拜访，就是有二十个阔少爷搬进来，对我们又有什么好处！”

“这要酌情而定，亲爱的。等到他们凑足了二十个整数，我便逐一登门造访。”

贝内特先生是个性情古怪的复杂人物，既喜欢讽刺嘲笑说风凉话，又显得态度矜持，真是变幻莫测，就连和他在一起生活了二十三年的贝内特太太也摸不透他的心思。相形之下，贝内特太太倒是容易让人理解。她智力低下、孤陋寡闻、喜怒无常，只要遇到不顺心的事，便自以为神经衰弱症复发。她生平的一件大事就是把女儿们嫁出去，整日以探亲访友和搜罗小道消息作为精神上的慰藉。

[1]丽茨是伊丽莎白的爱称。文中还出现丽莎、伊丽莎等爱称。





第二章


尽管贝内特先生在太太面前自始至终都撑得很硬，说他不愿意去拜访宾利先生，但实际上他在心里早已酝酿好了造访的计划，而且还是跟着第一批人去拜访他的。直到他去过宾利的府上之后的那天晚上，他的太太才知道了实情。消息是以这样的方式透露出去的——在观察二女儿调整帽子时，贝内特先生突然对她说：

“但愿你的帽子能讨得宾利先生的欢心，丽茨。”

“既然我们不打算拜访宾利先生，就无从知道他到底喜欢什么。”丽茨的母亲在一旁气哼哼地说。

“可是您忘啦，妈妈，”伊丽莎白说，“我们在参加舞会时会遇到他的。朗太太答应过要把他介绍给我们。”

“我才不相信朗太太的鬼话呢。她自己有两个亲侄女，还等着她引荐呢。她自私而虚伪，是个让人瞧不起的女人。”

“我和你看法相同，”贝内特先生说，“你能识破她的真面目，不指望她为你们牵线搭桥，听起来真叫人高兴。”

贝内特太太不屑于理睬他，可又按捺不住心头的怒火，于是便骂起女儿来。

“看在上帝的分上，请别一个劲儿地咳嗽，吉蒂！可怜可怜我吧，你要把我的神经都撕裂了。”

“吉蒂真不知趣，”做父亲的火上浇油地说，“咳嗽也不知道拣个时候。”

“我又不是咳嗽着取乐儿。”吉蒂恼怒地还了一句嘴。

“你所说的那个舞会定在哪一天开，丽茨？”

“从明天算起，还得再过两个星期。”

“哦，原来如此，”她的母亲叫嚷道，“朗太太要在开舞会的前一天才能赶回来。这样一来，她便来不及结识宾利先生，也就谈不上由她牵线搭桥啦。”

“好啦，亲爱的，你可以比你的朋友先行一步，反过来把宾利先生介绍给她喽。”

“无稽之谈，我的贝内特先生。我和他素昧平生，怎能充当介绍人呢！你不该这样冷嘲热讽。”

“你考虑问题周到细致，令我不胜敬佩。要了解一个人，两个星期的时间的确短得不足挂齿。这样一丁点儿时光转瞬便逝，到头来你不可能弄清他的真正品质。然而，我们如果不去尝试，其他人就会捷足先登。朗太太和她的侄女们无论怎样都绝不会放过这种天赐的良机。因此，倘若你不愿担此重任，我可要毛遂自荐了，反正朗太太总会理解我们的一片苦心的。”

女儿们瞪大眼瞧着自己的父亲。而贝内特太太只是在口里念叨着：“废话！废话！”

“你大惊小怪地重复这两个字眼儿到底是什么意思？”他叫嚷道，“我所说的全是为旁人当月下老人的话，你难道觉得这是一通废话？对于你的狭隘见解，我可不能苟同。谈谈你的看法吧，玛丽。你博览群书，并录其精华，是个思想深邃、见解独到的才女。”

玛丽想说几句明智的话，可是不知道怎么说才好。

于是，贝内特先生继续发表议论：“让玛丽考虑考虑再谈。咱们还是旧话重提，再说说宾利先生的事吧。”

“宾利先生叫我感到厌恶。”他的太太大声说道。

“听到你的话，真让我觉得扫兴。你怎么不早点申明你的观点呢？要是今天上午听到你这样说，那我当然就不会去拜访他了，这真是天大的不幸。不过，现在生米已煮成熟饭，我们也就免不了要交这个朋友了。”

果然不出他所料，女人们一听此话，个个都惊诧万状。尤其是贝内特太太，比谁都感到意外。她欢天喜地嚷了几句，随后马上当众宣布，说她早就料到会有这样的结局。

“你真是个好心的人儿，我亲爱的贝内特先生！我知道听了我的好言相劝，你一定会回心转意的。你既然将女儿们视为掌上明珠，肯定不会白白放弃这样的一个机会。你不知我有多么高兴。你也太会开玩笑了，上午去拜访了宾利先生，回来后却只字不提，直到现在才让真相大白。”

“吉蒂，现在你可以放大胆咳嗽啦。”贝内特先生说着，抽身走出了房间。看到自己的太太那副喜形于色的样子，他不免有些厌恶。

“孩子们，你们有一个多么出色的爸爸呀！”房门一关上，贝内特太太便对女儿们说道，“真不知你们怎样才能报答他的恩典。顺便提一下，这件事也耗费了我不少的心血。老实讲，活到我们这把岁数，哪有心思天天去结交新朋友。可是为了你们，我们老两口哪怕是肝脑涂地也在所不辞。莉迪亚，我的乖女儿，你的年龄虽然最小，但是到了开舞会的时候，宾利先生很可能会选中你做他的舞伴哩。”

莉迪亚满不在乎地说：“对这一点我毫不担忧。我的年龄虽然倒数第一，但我的个头却是最高的。”

接着，母女几个唧唧喳喳议论起宾利先生来，一方面猜测着他何时会来回访贝内特先生，一方面盘算着什么时候请他来吃饭。一个晚上的时光就这样在闲谈中度过了。





第三章


贝内特太太和五个女儿默契配合，千方百计想从丈夫口中套套有关宾利先生的情况，可听到的话却不尽如人意。她们可谓用尽了心机，左右夹攻贝内特先生——有赤裸裸的提问、巧妙的推测，也有漫无边际的想象，但贝内特先生计高一筹，终究未让她们得手。最后，她们只好舍近求远，去向她们的邻居卢卡斯夫人打听一些经过过滤的情报。从卢卡斯夫人口中听到的净是赞誉之词。她的丈夫威廉爵士对宾利先生非常满意，说他年轻英俊，态度和蔼可亲。最叫人兴奋的是，据说宾利先生意欲邀请许多人参加即将召开的舞会。还有什么消息能比这更激动人心呢！宾利先生很有可能会在舞会上寻觅可心人儿，因为喜欢跳舞就意味着坠入情网，前者是通向后者的一条途径。

贝内特太太对丈夫说：“如果能看到我的一个女儿在尼瑟费德别墅幸福地安下家，看到另外的几个女儿也喜结良缘，我这一辈子就心满意足、别无他求了。”

过了几天，宾利先生赶来回拜贝内特先生，和他在书房里闲坐了约莫十分钟的光景。他原指望可以饱饱眼福，一睹贝家小姐们的风姿倩影（对于她们的美貌，他早已有所耳闻），可看到的仅仅是她们的父亲。贝家的姑娘们要比他幸运，利用得天独厚的条件，从上边的一扇窗户窥视到他穿着蓝外套，骑的是一匹黑色骏马。

没过多久，贝府便发出请柬，邀宾利先生赴晚宴。贝内特太太提前精心策划，筹备了几道能够反映她高超的理财管家水平的菜肴。可宾利先生回了个话，打乱了所有的步骤。他说自己翌日进城有事，故而没有口福如期赴宴，云云。贝内特太太感到困窘万分、大失所望。她无法想象，他来哈福德郡立足未稳，到城里去会有什么要紧的事情办。她不由得生了几分忧愁，害怕他总是这样东跑西颠，不能够在尼瑟费德安定下来过平静的生活。后来听卢卡斯夫人说，他到伦敦去只是为了邀一班人马来参加舞会，她这才算打消了一些顾虑。很快就有消息传来，据说宾利先生打算请来十二名女士和七名男客为舞会增辉添色。一听说要来一大帮子女士，贝家的小姐们不由有些伤感。可是到了举办舞会的前一天，有人说宾利先生只从伦敦带来了六名女宾——其中有五名是他的亲姐妹，而另一位是他的表妹。这消息使贝府的小姐们感到轻松了一截子。开舞会的那一天，宾利先生一行只剩下了五人，只见他伙同他的两个姐妹、大姐夫以及另外一位年轻男子走进了舞厅。

宾利先生相貌堂堂，举手投足都显示出绅士风度。他的表情温文尔雅，谈吐真挚自然。他的姐妹仪态万方，一眼便能看出是超凡脱俗的女子。他的姐夫赫斯特先生没有什么出众之处，只是显得很有修养而已。然而，他的朋友达西先生身材高大、眉清目秀且气度高贵，很快便令众人为之倾倒。此人走进舞厅不足五分钟，人们就把话传开了，说他每年拥有一万镑的进项。他所到之处，都有羡慕的眼光在追随着他。直到舞会开了一半的时候，他才劣迹败露，转变了众人的看法。原来，他是个傲慢的家伙，总是那样目空一切，难于与之相处。尽管他在德比郡有一座偌大的庄园，也改变不了他在人们心目中留下的坏印象。人们觉得他是那样可憎而讨厌，无法与宾利先生相提并论。

宾利先生不大一会儿就和厅内的主要人物们混得烂熟。他热情洋溢、潇洒自如，每场舞都不落空，只恨舞会结束得太早。他声称要在尼瑟费德别墅再举办一次舞会。这样一个可亲可敬的绅士怎能不赢得人们的好感。他和自己的朋友相比，称得上是天壤之别。达西先生仅仅和赫斯特太太及宾利小姐各跳过一轮舞，然后便摆起架子，将其他的女士抛置一旁，整整一个晚上独自在大厅里来回踱步，只是偶尔同自己那一伙人谈上两句话。他那古怪的性格实在让人难以忍受。大家都觉得他是世界上最傲慢无礼、最可憎可恨的人，谁都不希望再见到他。尤其是贝内特太太，对他的成见最深。起先她只是不喜欢他的言谈举止，后来见他怠慢了她的一个女儿，便在心头燃起了一团仇恨的烈火。

由于男少女多，伊丽莎白有两场舞都被冷落了下来，坐在一旁观看。一次，宾利先生从舞池步出，规劝自己的朋友加入跳舞的人群。他站的地方碰巧和伊丽莎白近在咫尺，结果他和达西先生的对话被她听了去。

“上场吧，达西，”宾利先生说，“你最好和大家一起跳跳。我真不愿看到你傻乎乎地站在那儿瞧热闹。你的舞跳得挺不赖呀。”

“我不会再跳啦。你心里清楚，除非有一个非常熟悉的人做舞伴，否则我讨厌跳舞。今天这样的舞会让我感到沮丧。你的妹妹忙得不可开交，而和别的女人跳舞对我来说简直是一种刑罚，只能给我带来痛苦。”

“听听你说的话，真是吹毛求疵！”宾利失声喊道，“我敢说，今晚的舞会叫我眼界大开，我这一辈子都没看到过这么多可爱的女子。其中有些姑娘是天姿国色的绝代佳人。”

“这大厅里只有一位漂亮的女子，就是和你跳舞的那个。”达西先生说着，用眼睛望了望贝家的大小姐。

“算你有眼力！她可是我所见到过的最美丽的姑娘！不过，她的妹妹也艳压群芳，同时相当活泼可爱。她就坐在你的身后。如果你不反对，我可以请我的舞伴为你们作个介绍。”

“你说的是哪一个？”达西转过身去，盯着伊丽莎白瞧了瞧。当遭遇到对方迎上来的目光，便把身子扭回来冲自己的朋友说道：“她的长相可以过得去，不过还没有美到令我神魂颠倒的程度。再说，现在我情绪不高，不愿侍候那些被男人们冷落的年轻小姐。你不必再在我的身上浪费时间啦。赶快去找你的舞伴，欣赏她迷人的微笑吧。”

宾利先生果真照他的话做了。达西也举步走开了。伊丽莎白却坐着没动，内心涌起了一股对达西的反感情绪。她生性活泼，喜欢恶作剧，对一切滑稽可笑的事情都兴趣盎然。于是，她把达西当做笑料，向自己的朋友们绘声绘色刻画了一遍。

对贝家来说，这是一个愉快的夜晚。贝内特太太看到自己的大女儿赢得了尼瑟费德府上人的青睐，这就足够了。宾利先生邀请简跳了两轮舞，同时他的姐妹也对她另眼相看。简和自己的母亲一样感到由衷的高兴，不过没像她那般喜形于色。伊丽莎白觉察到了姐姐内心的欢乐。玛丽听到有人向宾利小姐提到了自己，说她是本地区最有造诣的女子。凯瑟琳和莉迪亚比较走运，从来就没缺少过舞伴，这是她们在舞场上最关心的一件事。就这样，母女几个兴高采烈地回到了浪搏恩村（贝内特一家是这个村庄的大户）。进了家门，她们发现贝内特先生还没有睡觉。平时，贝先生只要捧书在手，便会将时间抛置脑后。而这次迟迟不上床睡觉，却是因为他为好奇心所驱使，极想知道今晚的这个一直被大家朝思暮想的舞会究竟开得怎么样。他原以为他太太对那位初来乍到的贵人一定会大失所望，但他立刻就发现事实恰恰相反。

“太叫人高兴了，我亲爱的丈夫，”贝太太一人房门，便嚷嚷开了，“这是一个多么愉快的夜晚，多么别开生面的舞会啊。遗憾的是你没有去。简非常吃香，那情景真是难以形容。人人都说她光彩照人。宾利先生认为她具有沉鱼落雁的容貌，竟然跟她跳了两轮舞！光想想就令人兴奋，亲爱的，他邀请她跳了两轮舞呀！大厅里倩女如云，但只有简一人和他跳过两次舞。头一场舞，他邀请了卢卡斯小姐。看到他们俩在一起，我简直伤心透了。不过，他根本没有垂青于她。说实在的，有谁能看得上那姑娘呢？当简款款步入舞池时，宾利先生像是完全着迷了。他立即打听她的姓名，并请人为他引荐，接着便邀她跳舞。他的第三场是跟金小姐跳的，第四场舞跟玛丽亚·卢卡斯跳，第五场又跟简跳，而第六场跟丽茨跳法国的布朗格舞。”

“倘若他对我还有怜悯之心，就不会兴致勃勃地跳个没完！那么多舞，有一半就够我戗了！”她的丈夫不耐烦地叫喊了起来，“看在上帝的分上，别再提他的那些舞伴啦。天呀，但愿他跳头一场就扭了脚踝骨！”

“啧啧！亲爱的，”贝太太继续滔滔不绝地朝下讲着，“我非常喜欢他。他真是太英俊啦！他的姐妹们也是那样迷人。她们的服饰典雅大方，我平生还未见过有任何其他人的衣服能与之媲美。我敢说，赫斯特太太衣裙上的花边……”

她把话说到此处，又被丈夫打断了。贝内特先生不愿听人谈论服装。于是，她只好另寻话题，谈起了达西先生那粗鲁傲慢的态度。此时，她措辞尖酸刻薄，并带着几分夸张。

“不过，请你尽管放心，”她在末尾补充说，“丽茨没有被他看中，这对丽茨并不可惜，因为他是个极端讨厌可憎的人，不值得去讨他的欢心。他趾高气扬、不可一世，没有人能容忍他！他这儿走走，那儿遛遛，把自己看得十分了不起！瞧他那德性，才没有姑娘愿和他跳舞呢！亲爱的，要是你在场的话，就可以杀杀他的威风。我打心眼儿里厌恶那家伙。”





第四章


起初，简并不随口夸奖宾利先生，可是当她和伊丽莎白单独坐在一起时，便推心置腹地向自己的妹妹倾吐了她对宾利先生的爱慕之情。

“他是一个典型的出色青年，通情达理，风趣幽默，充满了朝气，”她说道，“我从未见过那样讨人喜欢的举止——既洒脱自如，又富于高深的教养！”

“他也很英俊，”伊丽莎白又补充了一句，“作为一位年轻男子就应该像他一样，潇洒文雅。他够得上一个完美无瑕的人喽。”

“他第二次请我跳舞时，我简直感到受宠若惊了。想不到他那样看得起我。”

“你真的没料到吗？我可是替你想到了。这正是我与你截然不同之处。遇到有人献个殷勤，你就手忙脚乱，而我却宠辱不惊。他第二次请你跳舞，这可是再自然不过的事情了。他怎能注意不到，你比舞厅里任何一位女士都要美丽得多。所以，你大可不必对他的热情感激涕零。说起来，他的确和蔼可亲，我也不反对你去喜欢他。但不要忘记，以前有许多蠢材也赢得过你的芳心。”

“别这样说，丽茨！”

“可不是么！你太容易对旁人产生好感，从来都看不到他们身上的缺点。在你的眼里，这个世界是美好的，天下净是善良人。我从未听你说过别人半句坏话。”

“虽然我的确不愿草率地对人横加挑剔，但我一向直抒己见，心里想什么嘴里就说什么。”

“我知道你的为人是这样的，可这也正是令我感到纳闷的地方。你是一个明白人。可你竟然对有些人的愚蠢行为和荒唐举动视而不见、置若罔闻。你走遍天下，到处都可以遇到道貌岸然的伪君子，摆出一副坦诚相见的模样。然而，如果说坦诚得不加任何掩饰和渲染，不夹带一点个人目的，既承认别人的长处、夸奖他人的优点，又绝口不提他们的短处，这可唯有你能做得到。请问，难道你也喜欢那位贵人的姐妹吗？她们的风度可比不上他呀。”

“乍一瞧，当然比不上。可是和她们攀谈起来，就会觉得她们都是些可爱的女人。宾利小姐打算和她的哥哥一起生活，帮他料理家务。她要不是个称心如意的邻居，那才怪呢。”

伊丽莎白听着姐姐讲话，嘴上虽一声未吭，但心里却不信服，因为据她在舞会上观察，宾家姐妹并非总是那般可爱。她的目光比简犀利，脾气也不像简那样拖泥带水，而且她很有主见，绝不因为旁人的垂青而改变自己的观点。因此，她不会由于听了几句好话，就对宾家姐妹发生好感。应该承认，宾家姐妹都是出类拔萃的女士。她们并非不善于谈笑风生，这要取决于她们高兴不高兴；她们也并非不会待人和颜悦色，问题在于她们是否乐意这样做。遗憾的是，她们都是那样傲慢与骄横。她们长得非常漂亮，在城里的一流私人专科学校里受过教育，并且有两万镑的财产，历来挥霍无度，专喜结交有身份的人。正是这方方面面才造就了她们的性格，使她们自命清高，处处瞧不起旁人。她们出生于英格兰北部的一个体面家族。对于自己的高贵血统，她们牢记不忘，但却往往忽视掉这样一个事实——她们兄弟的财产以及她们自己的家业都是靠做生意赚来的。

宾利先生的父亲曾经打算购置一座庄园，可惜没来得及了却心愿就与世长辞了。死后，他给儿子留下了一笔近十万镑的遗产。宾利先生继承父志，也打算买座庄园，并且一度在故乡的土地上转过念头。不过，现在他既然有了一幢漂亮的房子和些许田产，许多了解他性格的人就推断说，像他这样一个随遇而安的人，下半辈子恐怕要在尼瑟费德别墅度过，购置庄园的事将留给下一代人去做了。

他的姐妹们暗中为他着急，希望他拥有自己的庄园。尽管他目前只是暂且租了座别墅，宾利小姐仍然十分乐意做饭桌旁的主人。就连那位嫁了个穷光蛋名流的赫斯特太太，也把这儿当做自己的家，想来就来，想走便走。想当年宾利先生是听人提起了尼瑟费德别墅，才决计来这儿瞧瞧。当时，他还差两个年头才刚刚成年。他在别墅里里外外看了半个钟点，觉得位置和几所大房间都十分中意。又听了房东的一通吹嘘，他愈加感到满意，于是当场就把别墅租了下来。

他和达西在性格方面虽大相径庭，但彼此之间的友谊却始终如一。达西之所以喜欢他，是因为他极端随和及坦率，并且性情敦厚。这一切都与达西自己的个性形成了鲜明对照，尽管达西似乎从未对自身表现过不满。宾利对他言听计从，对他的见解佩服得五体投地。在智力方面，达西略胜一筹。这并不是说宾利就是个低能儿，而是说达西显得比较聪明些。达西虽然受过良好的教育，但他那傲慢、冷漠而刻薄的态度使得他极不合群。从这一方面讲，他的朋友可能比他高明得多了。宾利不管走到哪里，一定会讨人喜欢，而达西却处处得罪人。

从他们俩谈论麦里屯舞会的口气中，就能看到他们之间有着多么大的差异。宾利觉得舞会上的客人个个举止文雅，姑娘们人人面容姣美；在他看来，所有的人都是那般和善及彬彬有礼，都是那般无拘无束、开朗大方；他觉得自己一下子就和全场的人都处熟了；要论贝内特小姐，在他的心目中简直成了绝无仅有的美丽天使。而达西的看法就全然不同了。他认为他所看到的那些人既没有漂亮的外表，又缺乏潇洒的风度，没有一个人能引起他的丝毫兴趣，也没有一个人向他献殷勤和博取他的欢心。他承认贝内特小姐有几分姿色，只可惜她笑得太多。

赫斯特太太及其妹妹对他的观点持默认的态度——不过，她们仍然喜欢爱戴贝小姐，说她是个甜妞儿，明确表示愿和她深交下去。贝小姐就这样成了她们心目中的甜妞儿。宾利先生听到这样的夸奖，觉得正中下怀，因为他正是这般看待贝小姐的。





第五章


距浪搏恩不远的地方，住着一户人家，那便是威廉·卢卡斯爵士的府邸。贝内特一家和这个府上的人特别亲近。想当年，爵士是靠在麦里屯做买卖发迹的。后来当上了市长，他曾上书国王，为自己争取到了爵士的封号。这种莫大的荣耀对他产生了强烈的影响。他开始讨厌起自己的营生，讨厌住在小市镇里，于是他放弃了生意，告别小镇，带着全家搬到了距麦里屯约一英里路程的一幢房屋里居住。自此，这儿就被命名为卢卡斯府了。如今他成了显要人物，并且摆脱了做生意的烦恼，可以在家中自得其乐，一心一意从事社交活动了。他尽管对自己的地位欣然自得，却不因此而盛气凌人，反而对所有的人都应酬得非常周到。他生性不肯得罪人，待人接物热情友好、体贴入微，而且自从到了一趟王宫，回来后更加礼貌谦恭了。

卢卡斯太太是个挺不错的女人，没有一点刁钻气，故而成了贝内特太太不可多得的好邻居。卢家儿女成群。大女儿的年纪大约在二十六七岁，是个通晓事理、聪明伶俐的女子，和伊丽莎白非常要好。

卢府的几位千金以及贝家的小姐们，都觉得很有必要在一起聚聚，议论一下舞会上的情况。于是，在开完了舞会的第二天上午，卢府的姑娘们出了家门，来到浪搏恩村和贝家的闺秀交换看法。

贝内特太太一看见卢卡斯小姐，便不紧不慢、客客气气地说：“舞会一开始你就有了一个良好的开端，首先被宾利先生选去做了舞伴。”

“是呀，可是他喜欢的倒是第二个舞伴。”

“噢！我想你是指简喽，因为宾利先生跟她跳了两轮舞。看起来他是真的倾心于她……我相信他是真心实意的……我听到了一些闲话，不过我弄不清那是什么意思……那些话是针对鲁滨孙先生[1]的。”

“您大概是指我偷听宾利先生和鲁滨孙先生谈话的那档子事吧。我不是向您提过了吗？鲁滨孙先生问宾利先生喜欢不喜欢我们的那场麦里屯舞会，问他是不是觉得场上漂亮的女人为数不多。最后他问到哪一位女士最美。宾利先生脱口而出：‘容不得怀疑，数贝家的大小姐最美。对于这一点，不会有第二种意见。’”

“回答得太妙啦！说起来，这的确已成为定局了……事情看起来似乎……谁摸得准呢，也许一切都是镜花水月，叫人空欢喜。”

“论起来，我听到的这些话比你听到的那通厥词要顺耳些，伊丽莎，”夏洛特[2]说，“达西先生的话不如他朋友的话中听，没错吧？可怜的伊丽莎呀！他竟然说你的长相仅仅是可以过得去。”

“求求你别再提那件事了，免得丽茨想起来就为那家伙的无礼感到生气。他是那样一个讨厌的人，被他看中才倒八辈子邪霉呢。朗太太昨晚告诉我，那家伙在她身旁坐了有半个钟点，一声不吭，嘴皮子动也不动。”

“您敢说没听错？这里面是不是有些误会？”简问道，“我明明看见达西先生跟她讲话了么。”

“嗨，那是因为朗太太最后忍不住，才请他谈谈对尼瑟费德别墅的看法，迫使他不得已敷衍了几句。据朗太太所言，他面带愠色，似乎怪她不该同他讲话。”

简说：“宾利小姐告诉我，除非是和亲朋好友在一起，否则他从不多话。在亲近的人面前，他的态度十分和蔼可亲。”

“我根本不相信这种话，倘若他真是个和蔼可亲的人，就该对朗太太开启他那金口。不过我可以猜出其中的奥秘。他之所以不愿和朗太太交谈，我敢说那是因为他风闻朗太太连辆马车也没有，只是临时雇了辆车参加舞会。怪不得大家都说他是个瞧不起人的傲慢家伙。”

“他同朗太太讲不讲话，我倒不计较。我只是怪他当时没跟伊丽莎跳舞。”卢卡斯小姐说。

“丽茨，我要是你，下次偏偏不跟他跳舞。”贝太太说。

“妈妈，我相信我完全能够向您夸下这个海口，今生今世都不和他在一起跳舞。”

“他傲慢是傲慢，”卢卡斯小姐说，“可不像一般目空一切的人那样使我生气，这是因为他有自己傲慢的资本。这么样一个优秀的青年，门第好，又有钱，样样都比其他人强，也难怪他自以为了不起。把事情说穿说透，他有资格摆摆架子。”

“这倒是千真万确的，”伊丽莎白说，“假如他没有冒犯我的尊严，我也能很容易地原谅他的傲慢态度。”

“我认为傲慢是一般人的通病。”玛丽说。她觉得自己思想深邃、见解高明，于是讲起话来滔滔不绝。“从我所读过的许多书看来，这种病态的确是处处可见。根据人的天性，我们很容易染上这种病。差不多人人都会因为自己具有某种品质，或者想象着自己具有某种品质，而扬扬得意、自命不凡。虚荣与傲慢是迥然不同的两码子事，尽管常被用做同义词。一个人可以傲慢，但并不虚荣。傲慢一般涉及的是我们对自己的估价，而虚荣讲的是我们斤斤计较别人对我们的看法。”

“如果我像达西先生那样富有的话，”卢府的一个小哥儿突然喊了起来（他是随姐姐们一起跑来的），“我才不管什么傲慢不傲慢呢。我要养一群猎狗，还要天天喝上一瓶美酒。”

“那你的酒就喝得过量了，”贝内特太太说，“要是让我瞧见，我便立刻夺掉你的酒瓶。”

那孩子抗议说，她不应该那样做。贝太太又宣布了一遍，说她说到做到。就这样，客人们告辞时，一老一少的争论才不了了之了。

第六章


浪搏恩的那些娘儿们不久便去拜访了尼瑟费德的小姐们。赫斯特太太和宾利小姐也礼尚往来，到贝府回拜。她们对温文尔雅的贝小姐愈加喜欢。尽管贝妈妈叫人无法忍受，几个小妹妹也不值得攀谈，可是宾家的两姐妹还是愿意和贝府的两个大小姐做进一步的交往。简欣喜万分地领受了这份情意，可是伊丽莎白觉得她们对待所有的人都傲气十足，就连对待简也几乎没有什么两样，所以总是把她们看不上眼。她认为宾家的千金们之所以善待简，八成是出于她们的兄弟爱慕简的缘故。只要你看到他们俩在一起，就会看得很清楚，宾利的确倾心于简。伊丽莎白对姐姐的感情胸中有数，知道她一开头便看中了宾利先生，并一味放纵自己的情感，从某种角度讲是彻头彻尾坠入了爱河。好在简不愧为一个矜持稳重的姑娘，且对任何人都热情洋溢，叫常人觉察不到她对宾利先生怀有炽烈感情，也就没有人把她当轻浮女子看，这倒使伊丽莎白放宽了心。伊丽莎白曾向自己的朋友卢卡斯小姐袒露过她的这种心事。

夏洛特当时说：“如果能瞒过世人的眼睛固然不错，但有时候过分地遮掩和藏掖反而不美。要是一个女人使出本事隐匿自己的感情，很可能会坐失良机，失掉她的心上人。到了那个时候，即便让天下人都蒙在鼓里，又顶什么用呢。爱恋的男女双方差不多都怀着知恩图报或者抹不开脸面的心情，如让这种心情左右就难以成其好事了。当爱情揭开序幕的时候，双方都随随便便的，因为表露出些许好感是极其自然的事。然而，要是没有对方的配合，不管是男的还是女的，谁都不肯死心塌地地爱下去。在这种场合下，多半要由女方表露出几分爱来。宾利喜欢你的姐姐，这是毋庸置疑的；可是你的姐姐如果没有反应，他的感情也许永远都不会升华了。”

“像简那样性格的人，已经做出了最大限度的反应了。要是连我都看得出她对他的爱慕，而他却感觉不到，那他未免太蠢了。”

“别忘了，伊丽莎，他可不如你那样了解简的性格呀。”

“假如一个女人爱上了一位男子，只要她不着意隐瞒自己的感情，那位男子就一定能觉察到。”

“倘若双方接触频繁，他或许总能看得出来。可宾利就另当别论了。他固然和简见过几次面，但两人在一起的时间每一次都不长。何况他们都是和杂七杂八的人群混为一处，不可能全神贯注地促膝而谈。这就要求简时时刻刻多留点神，一有机会就挑逗他。等到把他握在自己手中，她便可以按自己的意愿消消停停谈情说爱了。”

伊丽莎白回答说：“要是只求嫁一户好人家，你的办法固然不错。如果我打算找个有钱的丈夫，或者随便物色一位夫君，我就采纳你的锦囊妙计。只可惜简是个讲感情的人，不喜欢耍小心眼儿。而且，她现在还弄不清自己对宾利究竟钟情到了何等地步，弄不清自己的这种感情是否明智。她认识他才两个星期。在麦里屯她跟他跳过四回舞；一天上午她到宾府时又见到了他，此后还和他一起吃过四次饭。就这么几次往来，叫她怎么能弄得清他的为人呢。”

“事情并不像你所说的那样。如果两人仅仅在一道吃吃喝喝，或许她只能看得出他的胃口好不好。可是你怎能忘了，他们可是亲亲热热一起度过了四个夜晚呀。在这么长的时间里，有什么话说不了呢。”

“嗨，这四个晚上叫他们彼此摸透了对方的嗜好，那就是两人都喜欢玩二十一点，不喜欢玩科默司纸牌。至于别的重要方面，我看他们相互之间仍缺乏了解。”

夏洛特说：“我希望简遂了自己的心愿。我觉得即便她明天就嫁他，她所能获得的幸福，也不见得比花上一整年的时间研究他的性格然后再嫁给他少。一桩婚姻的幸福与否，完全是个机缘问题。男女双方在婚前彼此就是把脾气摸得再透，就是再情投意合，也保证不了在婚后就一定能幸福美满。结了婚后，他们照样会逐渐发生分歧，彼此都感到烦恼。所以，你如果注定要和一个人相伴终生，那么最好尽量少了解他的缺点。”

“你的分析精辟是精辟，但并不一定可行。你明知道这种办法是靠不住的，我想你自己就不会这么做。”

伊丽莎白把一门心思都放到了宾利先生的态度上，仔细观察他对她的姐姐是否真心实意，却丝毫没有留意到她自己已经引起了宾利那位朋友的某些兴趣。说到达西先生，他起先并不承认她有什么动人之处，开舞会时投在她身上的目光就不带一点一滴的爱慕之意。第二次见面的时候，他也只不过吹毛求疵地扫了她几眼。他形成了自己的观点，并且把自己的看法告诉了自己的朋友，认为她的脸蛋无一可取之处。然而在一眨眼的工夫里，他就发现她那双乌黑的眸子既美丽又传神，把她的整个面孔都衬托得无比聪慧。紧接着，他在她的身上又发现了几个同样叫他感到意外的地方。以前他对她百般挑剔，觉得她这儿不匀称，那儿也不对劲，可现在他不得不承认她体态轻盈、婀娜多姿。他尽管一口咬定她不具备上流社会的翩翩风度，但内心却迷上了她的落落大方、诙谐幽默。而伊丽莎白对这些情况却一无所知。在她的眼里，达西还是那个处处惹人讨厌的男人，还是那个嫌她不够漂亮、不屑于跟她跳舞的家伙。

达西产生了一种愿望，想进一步了解她，找个机会与她攀谈，于是每当她和别人交谈时，他总是留神去听。有一次，在威廉·卢卡斯爵士府上召开盛大舞会时，他的所作所为引起了伊丽莎白的警觉。

伊丽莎白私下对夏洛特说：“达西先生不知安的是什么心，竟凑在一旁听我和福斯特上校聊天。”

“这个问题只能由达西先生自己回答。”

“要是他再为所欲为，我得让他明白我并不是一个糊涂的软蛋。他挖苦人的本事特别强，如果我不先给他点厉害瞧瞧，过不了多久我会怕上他呢。”

不大一会儿，达西来到了她们身旁，可表面上看没有半点和她们搭话的意图。卢卡斯小姐立刻用言语挑逗自己的朋友，怂恿她从正面和他谈谈。经她这么一激，伊丽莎白霍地转过身冲着达西说道：

“达西先生，我刚才和福斯特上校开了个玩笑，让他为大家在麦里屯举办个舞会。你看我这个建议是否提得十分得体呀？”

“提得带劲极啦，不过这本来就是小姐们津津乐道的话题呀。”

“你可真够尖刻的，一点情面也不留。”

“啧啧，伊丽莎，我得向你提条建议喽，”卢卡斯小姐说，“我去把琴打开，下边该怎么做，你自个儿心里明白。”

“你这种朋友真是世间少有！不管当着什么人的面，你总是要我弹琴唱歌！要是我存心在音乐上出风头，我真得感谢你的推荐之恩。不过，在场的客人听了一流乐师的演奏，我实在不好意思在他们面前献丑。”话虽这样说，但她到底还是经不起卢卡斯小姐的死磨硬缠，于是又改口道，“哎，如果你非得让我献丑，那我就只好从命了。”话音刚落，她又严肃地瞥了达西先生一眼，说道：“有句古话说得好：‘留口气吹凉粥。’今天我也要留口气，向大家献上我的歌。”

她的弹唱虽算不上空前绝后，但也悠扬悦耳。一两支歌儿终了，大家要求她再唱几支。她还未来得及回答，她的妹妹玛丽早已迫不及待地一屁股坐到了琴旁。话说这个玛丽，在他们家可是最丑的一个，所以她才发奋地学习，想有一番造诣以弥补面容上的不足。无论在什么场合下，她都急于表现自己，卖弄卖弄自己的本事。

玛丽既没有天赋，又缺乏鉴赏的能力。强烈的虚荣心促使她发奋图强，但同时也造就了她一脸迂腐的学究气和自命不凡的处世态度。正是这种学究气和傲慢的态度杀了风景，即便她取得的成就再高也无济于事。伊丽莎白弹琴虽说比她差上一半还有余，但伊丽莎白落落大方，没有矫揉造作的习气，故而大家倒乐于听她演奏。玛丽的几个妹妹和卢家的小姐们在大厅的另一端本来正跟两三名军官跳舞跳得如醉如痴，此时见玛丽弹完了一支很长的协奏曲，便一齐恳请她再奏几支苏格兰和爱尔兰的小调。

玛丽受到这样的夸奖和奉承感到喜出望外，即刻照妹妹们的要求弹了起来。

达西先生落落寡合地站在一旁，不与任何人说话，只是在心里生闷气，觉得这个晚上过得实在乏味无聊。满腹的心事使他没有觉察到威廉·卢卡斯爵士一直就在他身边。最后，威廉爵士才和他搭起了话：

“达西先生，跳舞是一种叫年轻人着迷的娱乐哩！比来比去，干什么都不如跳舞，我认为这是上流社会的一种最高雅的享受。”

“话虽这样说，但这种娱乐形式在低等社会同样风行。每个野蛮人都可以翩翩起舞。”

威廉爵士笑了笑没做声。后来见宾利也步入了舞池，他便对达西继续说道：“你的朋友舞姿优美，我坚信你也精通此道。是个行家里手吧。”

“爵士，我想你大概在麦里屯看见我跳舞了。”

“是的，我的确有幸观看了你的舞姿，真叫人大饱眼福哟。你是不是常到王宫里参加舞会？”

“连一次也没有，爵士。”

“就连到那种地方去，你都不肯赏光？”

“对于这类事情我能躲就躲，不管邀请我到哪儿去都是一样的。”

“你在城里一定有宅院吧？”

达西先生默默地点了点头。

“我曾经一度也产生过在城里定居的念头，因为我喜欢上流社会的生活。可我不知伦敦的空气是否适合于卢卡斯太太，所以事情就耽搁了下来。”

威廉爵士打住了话头，指望着对方应上两句，可达西懒得吱声。正在这叫人尴尬的时刻，伊丽莎白向他们姗姗走了过来。威廉灵机一动，想乘机献献殷勤，便对她叫道：

“亲爱的伊丽莎小姐，干吗不跳舞呀？……达西先生，这位年轻的小姐是位非常理想的舞伴，请允许我把她介绍给你。遇到这样一个美人儿，我想你总不会拒绝吧。”威廉爵士说着便牵起伊丽莎白的手，准备把她交给达西。达西先生感到十分意外，但还是心甘情愿地去接那只玉手。谁料想伊丽莎白把手猛地抽了回去，心绪不宁地对威廉说：

“爵士，我可压根就不想跳舞，千万别以为我到这儿来就是为了找舞伴。”

达西先生彬彬有礼地请求她赏个脸，跟他跳一场，然而伊丽莎白已经铁下心来，硬是不肯答应。任凭威廉爵士怎么劝说，她也没有动摇。

“伊丽莎白小姐，你的舞跳得不同凡响，如果你执意不让我看上一场，那你就未免太残忍了。这位先生虽说平时一点也不喜欢娱乐，可是要请他为我们大家跳场舞，我相信他不会不答应的。”

“达西先生真是太客气了。”伊丽莎白笑盈盈地说。

“他是有些客气。不过，谁不想和你这样的姑娘跳舞呢，亲爱的伊丽莎小姐？难得他这般诚心诚意地邀请你。”

伊丽莎白调皮地瞟了一眼就抽身走开了。她的拒绝并没有破坏她在达西心目中的形象。她走后，达西乐滋滋地回味着适才的情景。正当他心猿意马之时，宾利小姐走过来嚷嚷开了：

“我猜得出现在你心里正在想什么。”

“谅你猜不中。”

“你在想，一个个晚上都要和这帮人在一起消磨，实在枯燥得要命。说真的，我跟你颇有同感。以前，我从未像现在这样烦恼过！这儿的生活乏味又空虚，光看看那些吵吵嚷嚷、自以为是的人，就让你生一肚子气。巴不得你去训导训导他们呢！”

“老实告诉你，你全猜错啦。我所想的事情要妙得多呢。我心里在琢磨，一个漂亮的女人有了一双传神动人的眼睛，该会产生多么大的魅力啊。”宾利小姐立刻用眼光牢牢盯住了他的脸，希望他能讲出究竟是哪位女子赢得了他这样的垂青。达西先生鼓起了最大的勇气说道：

“她是伊丽莎白·贝内特小姐。”

“原来是伊丽莎白·贝内特小姐！”宾利小姐在嘴里把这个名字又念叨了一遍。“万万让人想不到呀。讲讲，你看中她有多长时间了？还有，我几时可以向你道喜呢？”

“我料到你会提这样的问题。女人家的念头千变万化，从敬慕之情立即可以联想到爱恋之心，眨眼之间又会涉及婚姻。一开始我就知道你会提到道喜的问题。”

“哦，要是你一本正经，我可就把这件事当做百分之百的决定了。你的那个丈母娘可是一个百里挑一的好人儿。你们结了婚，她就随你们到彭伯里安养天年，岂不美哉。”

宾利小姐讲得眉飞色舞，而达西却似听非听，一副不恼不怒的模样。于是，她就更加肆无忌惮了，一张利口愈发滔滔不绝起来。





第七章


贝内特先生有一块每年能给家里带来两千镑进项的田产，这差不多是他的全部家底了。只可惜他们生下的净是女儿身，家里连个男孩也没有，于是所有的产业将由一个远亲继承。贝太太的父亲生前在麦里屯当律师，死后给她留下了四千英镑的遗产。按说，这些私房钱是够贝太太的生活开销了，怎奈丈夫经营不善，所以家里的用项全靠她的钱补贴。

她有个妹妹嫁给了她父亲的办事员菲利普斯先生，那个妹夫后来继承了她父亲的行业；除此之外，她还有个兄弟，在伦敦做一种体面的生意。

浪搏恩村和麦里屯相隔只有一英里的路程，这么一段距离对贝家的千金而言是再便利不过了。她们每星期都要到麦里屯走上三四趟，一来问候问候她们的姨妈，二来还可以顺道逛逛女士帽子店。贝府的两个最小的姐妹，凯瑟琳和莉迪亚，特别热衷于这样的旅行。她们不如姐姐们那样心事重重，觉得无聊的时候，上午必定到麦里屯消磨时光，回来后晚上就有了内容丰富的谈话材料。乡下消息闭塞，然而她们由于不遗余力，总能从姨妈那儿打听到一星半点的趣闻。眼下，附近开来了一团民兵，总部就设在麦里屯，听说要在此地越冬哩。两姐妹闻讯后喜不自禁，因为这可以叫她们长不少的见识。

自此，她们每次到菲利普斯太太那儿，都可以获得极其有趣的情报。她们天天都不厌其烦地打听军官们的姓名及其社会关系。知道了军官的住处后，她们就开始直接与其接触。那些民兵团的长官们，菲利普斯先生全都逐一拜谒过，谁料想这竟为他的外甥女们打开了一扇通向幸福乐园的大门。现在可好啦，她们张口闭口都离不开那些军官们。以前只要提到宾利先生的偌大家产，她们的母亲就会手舞足蹈。可如今在贝家两个小姐妹眼里，与军官们的制服相比，宾府的产业简直一钱不值。

一天上午，贝内特先生听到她们你一言我一语地扯的尽是这个话题，就不由得冷若冰霜地说：

“看你们谈话的神气，我敢断定你们是再蠢不过的丫头片子。对这我以前还是半信半疑的，而现在我可完全相信啦。”

凯瑟琳一听此话，觉得有些难为情，赶忙住了嘴。莉迪亚却不管那一套，继续抒发她对卡特上尉的爱慕之心，并声称她很想和卡特上尉再见一面，因为他明天上午要到伦敦去。

此刻，贝太太在一旁数落起丈夫来：“亲爱的，我很奇怪，你怎么动不动就说自己的孩子愚蠢。要是我呀，别人家的孩子我可以看不起，可我绝不会瞧低自己的孩子。”

“要是我的孩子真是愚蠢，我觉得我应该有自知之明的精神。”

“言之有理。可事实上她们一个个都很聪明。”

“只有在这一点上，咱们俩的看法有所不同。我曾经希望咱们处处都往一块儿想，可现在我必须和你持不同的观点，因为我认为咱家的两个小女儿蠢到了极点。”

“亲爱的贝内特先生，你可不能指望小孩子家和父母一样有真知灼见。等她们到了咱俩这把岁数，我敢说她们就再也不会记挂什么军官了。记得在从前，我就十分倾心于穿红制服的军人，说句老实话，直到现在我还喜欢军人呢。要是哪位年轻漂亮的上校，每年有五六千镑的进项，随便向我的哪一个女儿求婚，我都不会将他拒之门外。那天晚上我在威廉爵士府上看见福斯特上校穿了一身戎装，就觉得他很神气。”

“妈妈，”莉迪亚嚷道，“姨妈说福斯特上校和卡特上尉到沃森小姐家去的趟数，已经不像他们初来时那样勤了。她说她常看见他们出入于克拉克图书馆。”

贝太太正待答话，不料府上的仆人送进来一封信，交给了简。这封信来自尼瑟费德别墅，仆人站立一边等着取回信。贝太太高兴得双眼放射出异彩，在长女读信时，她急切地叫喊道：

“喂，简，是谁写的？信里讲的是什么内容？赶快告诉我们这封信都说了些什么，宝贝。”

“信是宾利小姐写来的。”简说完，便出声地念了起来：


亲爱的朋友：

你要是不肯发发慈悲，今天光临寒舍和我们共进晚餐，我和路易莎可就终生怨恨您了。你知道，两个女人成天在一起叽叽咕咕，到头来没有不吵架的。所以，接信后希望你尽快赶来。我哥哥不在家，他要和几位朋友到军官们那儿吃饭。





你永远的朋友卡罗琳·宾利



“和军官们一起吃饭！”莉迪亚失声喊了起来，“这件事姨妈怎么没有告诉我们。”

“宾利先生要出去赴宴，这真是叫人感到扫兴。”贝太太说道。

“我能用一下马车吗？”简问。

“不行，亲爱的，你最好骑马去。天好像要下雨了，下了雨你就得在宾府留宿。”

“如果你胸有成竹，敢保证宾家的人不会送她回来，这倒是一个妙得很的点子。”伊丽莎白说。

“宾利先生要用车和朋友们一道赴宴，而赫斯特夫妇连匹马都没有，这事实不是明摆着么。”

“我倒情愿乘车去。”

“傻孩子，农田里正用马匹，我知道你爸爸匀不出多余的马来。你说是吗，老爷子？”

“农田里是缺马匹，可我却常常抓不到手呀。”

伊丽莎白抢白道：“今天您要是把马占用了，妈妈的计谋可就得逞了。”

最后，她终于逼迫父亲承认家里拉车的马都已派上了用场，一时抽不出来。这样，简只好骑马出发了。贝妈妈送她到大门口，一边兴高采烈地唠叨个不停，说天气一定会阴下来。后来，贝妈妈果然如愿以偿了。简出了家没多久，天空便降下了滂沱大雨。妹妹们都很替她操心，而贝妈妈却乐不可支。这场雨不停点地下了一个晚上，简也就自然回不了家了。

“幸亏我想出了这么个好主意！”贝太太得意扬扬地把这话重复了好几遍，仿佛天降大雨都是她一手安排的。然而，直到第二天早晨，她才得知她的神机妙算究竟给女儿带来了多大的幸福。早餐还没吃完，尼瑟费德府上便派仆人送来了一张便条。便条是写给伊丽莎白的：


亲爱的丽茨：

今天早晨我感到十分不舒服，我想大概是因为昨天浇了雨的缘故。承蒙朋友们的关心，要我身体康复后再回家，她们非得请琼斯先生为我瞧病不可，因此，当你听到我就医的消息，千万别感到惊慌。其实，我不过有点喉咙疼和头痛，并无大的毛病。





姐姐草草



贝内特先生听伊丽莎白读完便条，冲着贝太太嚷开了：“喂，老婆子，要是你的女儿染上了重病，或者就此断送了性命，可全是因为她奉你的命令追求宾利先生。”

“瞧你说的！根本不用为她的性命担心。哪有患点伤风感冒就死人的道理。她会得到精心照料的。只要她待在宾家，包管万事遂愿。假如能用一下家里的车子，我想去探望探望她。”

真正着急的是伊丽莎白，不管有车无车，她都打定主意去一趟。她既然不会骑马，唯一的办法就是步行前往。于是，她把自己的打算说了出来。

贝妈妈嚷嚷道：“你怎么这样蠢！道路泥泞难行，亏你想得出来！到了那儿，你那副狼狈的样子怎么见人呢。”

“不管模样怎么样，我的目的是看望简。”

“你的意思是不是让我为你弄几匹马套车？”

“这并非我的意思。走走路又有何妨。这点路程不过只有三英里，对一个诚心诚意的人根本不在话下。晚饭前我就能赶回来。”

“你有一副大慈大悲的菩萨心肠，很值得人钦佩，”玛丽说道，“不过，还得有点理智，万不可感情用事。依我看，无论干什么事都应量力而行。”

“我们可以陪你走到麦里屯。”凯瑟琳和莉迪亚异口同声地说。伊丽莎白接受了她们的好意。随后，三位年轻小姐一起上了路。

“如果走快点，或许还能来得及在卡特上尉临行前看看他。”莉迪亚边走边说。

三姐妹到了麦里屯便分了手：两个妹妹到一位军官太太家里去，而伊丽莎白独个儿继续朝前赶路。她甩开大步穿过一片片田野，急匆匆跨过一道道篱笆和跳过一片片水洼，最后终于看见了宾家的宅院。这时的她双脚乏力，袜子上净是泥污，脸蛋累得通红通红。

她被领进了餐厅，只见宾家的人都在那儿，只是看不到简的踪影。她的到来使大家都感到十分意外。赫斯特太太和宾利小姐简直想象不来，她竟然能独自一人徒步从三英里开外的家中赶来，而且是在一大清早，道路又如此泥泞难行。伊丽莎白料定她们瞧不起她的莽撞行为。不过，从表面看，宾家姐妹待她却客客气气、礼貌周到。要说宾利先生，他表现得热情洋溢，对她关怀备至，比他的姐妹所持的态度强上许多。达西先生说话不多，而赫斯特先生只字不语。达西先生的内心被一种复杂的感情左右，他既爱慕伊丽莎白走路之后那红艳艳的脸蛋，又怀疑她是否值得为这么一丁点小事就长途跋涉独自一人赶来。至于赫斯特先生，他脑子里想的只是他的早饭。

伊丽莎白询问起姐姐的病情，才发现情况不太妙。据说贝内特小姐昨晚没睡好觉，现在虽然能起床，但高烧不退，所以不便出房门。令伊丽莎白感到高兴的是，他们马上就领她去见自己的姐姐。简见她走了进来，流露出十分喜悦的心情。原来她早就盼望着家中亲人来探望她，只是由于害怕他们着急，给他们添麻烦，她在便条中才没有袒露自己的心愿。现在的她有气无力，不能够多说话，因此当宾利小姐走开后，房间里只剩下她们姐妹俩时，她只叙述了一下宾家如何无微不至地照料她以及她是怎样地感激他们，再没有言及其他。伊丽莎白一声未响，默默地侍候着她。

早饭吃完之后，宾家姐妹走进来问安。看到她们那么关怀和爱护简，伊丽莎白不禁对她们产生了好感。医生来检查了病人的症状，说简患的是重感冒（其实这也是可想而知的），他嘱咐她们要精心护理，又劝简上床休息，并给她开了几剂药。医生的嘱咐立即照办了，因为简的热度又有些上升，头也痛得非常厉害。伊丽莎白寸步不离地守在她的病榻旁，而宾家姐妹也随时在左右侍候。男人们出去了，其实他们就是在家也帮不上什么忙。

三点整的时候，伊丽莎白觉得应该回家了，于是十分勉强地向主人告辞。宾利小姐要她乘马车走，而她准备稍许推让后便接受主人的美意。不料，简这时却说她舍不得让妹妹走，于是，宾利小姐临时改变了主意，没再提派辆车送伊丽莎白的事情，索性邀请她留下来。伊丽莎白感激不尽地答应了。接下来，她们差人上浪搏恩去，把她在尼瑟费德暂住的事情告知家中，同时让家里捎些衣服来。





第八章


五点钟的时候，宾家两姐妹出去更衣；六点半钟，伊丽莎白被请去吃晚饭。大家都礼貌周全，纷纷询问简的病情，其中数宾利先生问得最为关切，这叫伊丽莎白非常惬意。只可惜简的病情不见一点好转，因而伊丽莎白的回答使人感到不太愉快。听到这话，宾家姐妹几次三番地表达了自己的悲痛心情，说重感冒是非常可怕的，又说她们自己是如何害怕得病。可是在议论了一通之后，她们再没有把简的病当一回事。看到她们当简不在跟前时就对简这样无情无义，伊丽莎白不由又产生了对她们早先就有的厌恶感。

在所有的人里边，只有她们的兄弟能使伊丽莎白感到称心。他对简的关怀之情是显而易见的，同时他对伊丽莎白也和颜悦色，把她照顾得无微不至。伊丽莎白本来以为人家都把她当做不速之客，可是有了宾利先生的这份情意，她也就摈弃了这种想法。除了他以外，别的人都不理睬她。宾利小姐和达西先生谈得热火朝天，她的姐姐也在一旁凑热闹。至于那位坐在伊丽莎白身边的赫斯特先生，他可是个懒骨头，活在世上就是为了吃喝及玩牌。他看到伊丽莎白宁肯吃普普通通的菜而将烩肉放到一旁，便断定自己和她全无共同语言。

吃完晚饭，伊丽莎白立刻回到了简那儿。她一走出餐厅，宾利小姐就开始说起了她的坏话，说她既傲慢又无礼，不懂一点为人处世的道理，还说她其貌不扬、言谈举止索然无味。赫斯特太太也持相同的看法，并且还补充了几句：

“总而言之，她除了擅长走路之外，简直一无是处。我怎么也忘不了今天早晨她的那副丑态，看起来真像个野人。”

“一点不错，路易莎。我当时差点没笑出声来。她这一趟跑得毫无价值！难道就因为姐姐患了点伤风感冒，就需要这样满世界乱窜吗？想想她那蓬头垢面的样子，真是个邋遢鬼！”

“还有她的衬裙呢。你们要是注意到了她的衬裙就好啦，我绝对不瞎说，上面糊的泥足有六英寸厚。她放低了外边的裙子想遮住那些泥巴，可还是遮不住。”

“你的形容也许非常逼真，路易莎，”宾利说，“可是我并不以为然。我倒觉得伊丽莎白·贝内特小姐今天早晨走进来的时候，她的外表一点也不狼狈。我根本就没有看到她的什么泥巴衬裙。”

“你肯定看到了，达西先生，”宾利小姐说，“我想，你总不愿意让你自己的妹妹也弄成那副模样吧。”

“当然不愿意。”

“她在没过脚踝的泥地里跑了三四英里或五六英里的路程，而且是孤单单的一个人！不知她本着什么样的目的。我看她是狂妄自大，显露出乡下人没有教养的野性。”

宾利先生说：“我看没有什么不好的。这表明了她对自己姐姐的深情厚谊。”

宾利小姐压低嗓门说：“达西先生，她的这种冒失劲恐怕会改变你的看法，使你不再崇拜她那双美丽的眼睛了吧。”

“我的看法一点也没有改变，”达西回答道，“我反而觉得她的眼睛更加明亮了。”他的话落地生根后，屋里沉默了一会儿。紧接着，赫斯特太太又开始说话了：

“我非常赞赏简·贝内特，她倒是个甜蜜蜜的姑娘。我诚心诚意希望她能攀门好亲事。不过，只可惜她碰上了那样的父母，亲戚们又如此俗不可耐，她恐怕难以嫁到如意的人家。”

“我好像听你说过，她的姨父在麦里屯当律师么？”

“是呀，她们还有一个舅舅住在伦敦的齐普赛大街附近的一个地方哩。”

“那儿可是京城的商业街呀。”她的妹妹随声附和地说。接着，姐妹俩都捧腹大笑了起来。

宾利不平地高声喊叫道：“她们的舅舅即便多得能充斥整条齐普赛大街，也丝毫不会减低她们迷人的魅力。”

“但这却可以妨碍她们嫁给在社会上有头有脸的男人。”达西说道。

宾利没有和他辩驳。他的姐妹们听了达西的话却正中下怀，于是继续拿简卑微的亲戚开玩笑，胡闹了老半天。

然而，一走出餐厅她们就换了一副嘴脸，重新做出温柔体贴的样子来到简的房间，陪她一直坐到喝咖啡的时候。简仍病得很严重，伊丽莎白一刻不离地守着她。就这样到了傍晚时分，姐姐入睡后，她才放下心来。她虽然仍不愿离开，但她觉得应该下楼看看。来到客厅里，她发现大家都在玩牌。立时就有人邀请她也凑个数，可她害怕那伙人赌注下得太高，于是便谢绝了。她说她可以拿本书消遣消遣，待一会儿还得上楼去侍候生病的姐姐。赫斯特十分惊讶地望了望她。

“怎么，你宁肯看书也不愿玩牌？”他说，“这可真是稀奇少见。”

宾利小姐阴阳怪气地说：“伊丽莎白·贝内特小姐瞧不起这种游戏。她是个了不起的读书人，对别的事情不感兴趣。”

“不管你的话是夸奖还是批评，我都担当不起。我并非了不起的读书人，还有，我对许多事情都很感兴趣。”

“我知道你对你姐姐的身体感兴趣，”宾利说，“但愿她能尽快康复，那时你的心情就会轻松愉快。”

伊丽莎白诚恳地感谢了他，然后向一张上面放了几本书的桌子跟前走去。宾利立刻提出要为她再拿几本书，只要书房里有的都取来。

“我的藏书要是再多些就好了，那样便于你阅读，对我的面子也好看。可惜我是个懒散的人，藏书不多，读过的就更是屈指可数了。”

伊丽莎白告诉他说，她翻阅一下客厅里的书就已经不错了。

宾利小姐说：“我很奇怪，爸爸怎么只留下了这么几本书。你在彭伯里的那个藏书室真叫人羡慕，达西先生。”

“没有什么可炫耀的，”达西说，“因为那是许多代人努力的结果。”

“你自己又添了不少书。我总见你买书。”

“在现在的这种年月，绝对不能忽视家族藏书室的建设。”

“怎么谈得上忽视！我认为你什么事情都没有忽视过，总是千方百计为你的那块宝地增光添色。查尔斯啊查尔斯[1]，以后你若是建造房屋，只要有彭伯里一半漂亮就行啦。”

“希望如此。”

“我可要建议你在那一带购置房产，把彭伯里作为仿效的榜样。全英国没有一个地方比德比郡更美丽的了。”

“我很乐意采纳你的建议。只要达西肯忍痛割爱，我就把彭伯里买下来。”

“我只是随便说说而已，查尔斯。”

“卡罗琳，我敢说，买下彭伯里比依样仿造，可行性更大些。”

伊丽莎白听他们斗嘴听得入了神，弄得没心思看书了，于是索性将手中的书搁置一旁，挪步走到牌桌跟前，坐在宾利先生和他的姐姐之间，看他们玩牌。

这时宾利小姐又问达西：“从春天到现在，达西小姐长高了许多吧？将来她能长我这么高吗？”

“我想她能。就目前而言，她的个头已赶上了伊丽莎白·贝内特小姐，恐怕比她还高些呢。”

“我多么希望能再次见到她！我还从未遇到过比她更讨人喜欢的小人儿。她模样儿好、举止文雅，小小的年纪便锻炼得多才多艺。特别是她的钢琴弹得出神入化，堪称一绝。”

宾利先生说：“年轻的女士怎么都这样有能耐，一个个都身怀绝技，真叫人惊喜万分。”

“听听，一个个都身怀绝技！此话怎讲，亲爱的查尔斯？”

“是的，我认为她们全都是如此。她们都会装饰台桌、点缀屏风以及编织钱袋。我所认识的女士，对这些差不多都样样精通。每逢听人提起哪位年轻小姐，准会先夸她多才多艺和身怀绝技。”

达西说：“你所列举的才艺都是实实在在、普普通通的活计。有许多妇女就因为会编织钱袋或点缀屏风，便可以博得身怀绝技的美名，这岂不荒唐。所以，我实在不能同意你这样分析所有的女士。不是我夸口，我认识的女士的确不少，但真正身怀绝技、多才多艺的却只有那么六人。”

“我和你有同感。”宾利小姐随声附和道。

“这么说，在你看来，一位多才多艺的女人必须具备许多条件喽。”伊丽莎白开始发表言论。

“不错，是要具备许多条件。”

“这是很自然的！”达西忠实的助手叫喊道，“超越不了常人的水平，就不能称其为多才多艺、身怀绝技。一个女人必须精通音乐、歌唱、绘画、舞蹈以及现代语言，才能博得这个美名。除此之外，她还必须有高雅的气度、稳健的步态、悠扬的音调、时髦的服饰和风趣的表情，否则只能算及格了一半。”

达西接着说：“这些条件都是必须具备的。另外，一个才女还应当博览群书以加深修养。”

“怪不得你说你只认识六位才女。据我现在看来，你恐怕连一个才女也不认识。”

“你怀疑她们不具备这些条件？你怕是对你的同性太苛刻啦。”

“这样的才女我从未见过。我没看到过一个女人能像你们所说的那样，既有卓越的才干，又情趣高雅、勤奋好学、仪态文静。”

赫斯特太太和宾利小姐听后一起发难，指责她不该疑心太大，并强调说她们自己就认识许多符合以上条件的才女。直至赫斯特先生抱怨起来，让她们注意桌上的牌局，才结束了她们的舌战，屋里静了下来，伊丽莎白不久便走了出去。

房门在她身后关上了，只听宾利小姐说：“伊丽莎白·贝内特这样的年轻女子为了在男人面前抬高自己的身价，就着意地贬低别的女人。这种办法用在许多男人身上都可以奏效。可我认为这是一种下流的诡计，一种卑鄙的手腕。”

达西听出这席话是冲自己来的，于是急忙说：“女人们为了将意中人搞到手，有时竟不择手段，什么事情都做得出来，实在庸俗得很。按说，任何玩弄阴谋诡计的人都应该受到鄙视。”

宾利小姐不太满意他的答话，索性不再谈这方面的事情了。

随即，伊丽莎白走了进来，说她姐姐的病情更加恶化，而她不能抛下姐姐自己回家去。宾利竭力主张立刻请琼斯先生来诊断，他的姐姐和妹妹却认为乡下郎中只会误事，主张赶快派人进城请位名医来。伊丽莎白不同意那样动众，然而对她们兄弟的建议却没有执意反对。最后，大家作出了决定——如果简的病不见明显起色，第二天一大早便派人去请琼斯先生。宾利先生心里十分不安，他的姐姐和妹妹也声称她们感到很难过。吃过晚饭后，姐妹俩来了个二重唱，才算减轻了几分心中的痛苦。宾利先生想不出好办法来排遣悲哀，只有关照府上的管家要尽心尽意地侍候好病人和病人的妹妹。

[1]查尔斯即宾利先生。





第九章


伊丽莎白在姐姐的房间里守了大半个夜晚。次日一大清早，宾利先生就派了个女仆来询问病情；过了一会儿，他的姐姐和妹妹也打发两位文雅的侍女来问明情况。伊丽莎白总算可以聊以自慰地告诉来人，姐姐的病已有好转迹象。她的心情稍微轻松了些，但她还是请求宾府差人到浪搏恩送个口信。她希望妈妈能来探望简，亲自判断一下病情。口信即刻便送了出去，她的希望也很快落到了实处——早饭时间刚过，贝内特太太就由两个小女儿陪伴着抵达了尼瑟费德别墅。

贝太太如果看到简真的有生命危险，那她一定会伤心的；可是简的病并不怎么严重，于是她便放下了心来；她一点也不希望大女儿马上复原，因为简一恢复健康，在尼瑟费德就住不下去了。鉴于此因，任凭简怎样央求带她回家，贝妈妈都不同意。况且，就连那位和贝妈妈同时来到的医生也认为不便将病人迁回浪搏恩去。贝妈妈陪简闲坐了一会儿，就见宾利小姐赶来请她们用早餐。于是，母女四人随宾利小姐到餐厅去了。在餐厅里，宾利迎接了她们，说他希望贝内特太太看了大小姐的病后一定会觉得比她预料的要轻。

贝太太回答道：“我万万没料到事情会这么严重。她病得十分厉害，不宜迁来迁去。琼斯先生嘱咐说绝对不能送她回家。所以，小女就要托你再照顾几天啦。”

“怎么能送她回家呢！”宾利叫道，“连想都不要这样想。我相信我的妹妹也不同意送她走。”

宾利小姐冷冰冰但又不失礼貌地说：“您尽管放心好啦，老太太。贝小姐在我们这儿，一定会受到尽心尽意的照料。”

贝太太不由千恩万谢起来。

她说：“要不是有你们这样一些朋友，简不知会惨成什么样呢。她病得很厉害，经受着痛苦的折磨。好在她有极大的耐性——她历来如此，我还从未见过有谁比她的性格更招人喜爱。我常常告诉我的另外几个女儿，说她们比起她们的姐姐要差十万八千里呢。宾利先生，你的这所房子很漂亮，鹅卵石小道那儿的景观真是美不胜收。在乡下，没有一个地方能和尼瑟费德别墅相媲美。你的租期虽说很短，但我劝你不要急着搬走。”

“我干事总是风风火火的，”宾利说，“假如决定离开尼瑟费德，我可能在五分钟内就会拔腿走人。不过，就目前而言，我打算住在这儿。”

“果然不出我所料。”伊丽莎白说。

“你开始了解我啦，是吗？”宾利转过身来，对她大声地说。

“不错！而且我还对你了如指掌哩。”

“希望这是一句恭维的话。不过，一眼就能让人看穿五脏六腑，未免有些可悲吧。”

“这得酌情而论。一个性格深沉、复杂的人，并不一定就比你这样的人更令人敬重，或者更令人鄙视。”

贝妈妈连忙嚷道：“丽茨，别忘了你在做客。可别像在家里那样，跑到这儿撒野。”

“想不到你还是个研究性格问题的专家呢，”宾利紧接着说，“那一定是门很有趣的学问吧。”

“是的。不过，最耐人回味的要算复杂的性格本身。起码来说，这样的性格有研究的价值。”

达西说：“在乡下，能作为这种研究对象的人简直可以说是寥若晨星。这儿是一个封闭而又单调的社会。”

“然而，乡下的人却是千变万化的，他们身上总会有值得观察的新东西。”

“一点不错，”贝太太刚才听到达西以那样一种口气议论乡下，不禁动了气，于是喊叫了起来，“我可以向你们保证，咱们乡下比起城里来并不差。”

大伙儿都吃了一惊。达西用眼睛打量了她一会儿，然后不声不响走开了。贝太太自以为占了上风，愈发得意了起来。

“据我看，伦敦除了店铺和娱乐场所外，别的地方并不比乡下强。相形之下，乡村可舒适得多啦。你说是吗，宾利先生？”

“一来到乡下我就不舍得离去，”宾利答道，“在城里的时候，我也有这种感觉。所以，各有各的长处，不管乡下还是城里我都喜欢。”

“嗳，那是因为你的性格好。可是那位先生，”贝太太说到此处，朝达西横了一眼，“却好像把乡下看得一文不值。”

“妈妈，您的话太离谱啦，”伊丽莎白为自己的母亲感到脸发烧，不由说道，“您误解了达西先生的意思。他只是说乡下不像城里那样有形形色色的人，这您可得承认是事实呀。”

“当然喽，宝贝，谁也没说不是那么回事。然而，要是说这儿这样的人寥若晨星，我就不同意了。我觉得比这大的村镇就没有几个。平常跟我们来往吃饭的少说也有二十四户人家。”

要不是顾及伊丽莎白的面子，宾利早就忍俊不禁啦。他的妹妹可就没有他那么体贴人，只见她向达西挤挤眼，发出了一个寓意深长的微笑。伊丽莎白急于想转移母亲的思路，于是便问母亲，夏洛特·卢卡斯自她离家以后到浪搏恩去过没有。

“去过，她是昨天随她的父亲一道去的。要说她的父亲威廉爵士，那可是个顶呱呱的人。你说对吗，宾利先生？他谈吐不凡、性格温和，从来没有一点架子，和所有的人都谈得来。这便是我所说的具有良好的教养的人。不幸的是，有些自以为了不起、金口难开的先生却把这个有关教养的问题完全搞混了。”

“夏洛特和你们一块儿吃了饭？”

“没有，她硬要回家。我想，大概是她家里等着她回去做肉饼。不是吹牛，宾利先生，我所雇的用人都可以胜任自己分内的工作。所以，我的女儿没有干过粗活。不过，大家有目共睹，卢家的几个姑娘都是相当不错的。唯一不足的是，她们全都其貌不扬！我个人倒并不觉得夏洛特有多么难看，她毕竟是我们家亲密的朋友啊。”

“她看起来是个非常讨人喜欢的年轻小姐。”宾利说。

“不错！她是讨人喜欢，但你必须承认，她的长相的确不雅观。连卢卡斯太太也常说她丑，并且为了简的美貌而妒忌我呢。我并不喜欢吹嘘自己的孩子，可是说句老实话，比简更漂亮的人是不多见的。这里面并无偏袒之心，因为大家都是这么说的。她十五岁的那年，我们到城里我的弟弟加德纳家做客，那儿有一位绅士对她一见钟情。我的弟媳断言，他肯定会在我们离开之前向简求婚。然而，他并没有那样做。也许，他当时觉得简太小了，还不到谈情说爱的年龄。后来，他为简写了一些诗，一些优美隽永的诗。”

“他的爱情也就这么结束了，”伊丽莎白不耐烦地说，“有许多情种都是以同样的办法忘掉了自己的意中人。不知是谁第一个发现，诗句竟具有驱逐爱情的奇功妙用！”

“我素来认为，诗是爱情的食粮。”达西说。

“对于美好、坚贞而健康的爱情而言，诗也许是食粮，因为只要本身强壮，无论吃什么东西都可以获得滋补。然而，如果所谓的爱情只是一种脆弱而不成熟的念头，那一首绝妙的十四行诗便能叫它毁于一旦。”

达西没做声，只是笑了笑，房间里其他人也一声不响。伊丽莎白唯恐母亲再次出丑，很想继续谈下去，可脑子里想不出词来了。过了一小会儿，贝太太打破沉寂，又把宾利先生感谢了一遍，感谢他尽心照料简。同时，她又表示了歉意，说丽茨也给他添了不少麻烦。宾利先生的应答之词诚恳而有礼貌，使得他的妹妹也不得不客客气气的，说了些十分得体的话。宾利小姐的态度并不算十全十美，可贝太太已经够满意的了。不一会儿，贝太太吩咐下人备马套车。这个号令一下，她的那个最小的女儿走到了人面前。自从一来到宾府，两个小姐妹就在窃窃私语，最后决定由莉迪亚催催宾利先生，要求他兑现他刚来乡下时所作的承诺——在尼瑟费德别墅举办一次舞会。

莉迪亚今年十五岁，浑身上下圆滚滚的，是个发育得很好的姑娘。她细皮嫩肉，脸上总是乐呵呵的，被母亲捧为掌上明珠，在母亲的影响下年纪轻轻的便步入了社交场合。她生性活泼好动，有一股不知天高地厚的劲儿。她的姨夫一次次以美酒佳肴宴请民兵团的军官，那些军官们见她风情种种，于是便和她打情骂俏，这就更使她忘乎所以、放浪形骸了。因而，她有足够的胆量和宾利先生谈举办舞会的事，并一针见血地提醒他，说他曾对此许过诺。她强调说，假如他背弃自己的诺言，那将是天下最丢脸的行为。她的言语唐突莽撞，但宾利先生的回答却很有分寸，叫贝太太听起来十分顺耳。

“我可以向你保证，”他说，“我很乐意遵守自己的诺言。等你的姐姐恢复后，由你随便订个日期就行啦。你总不愿意在你姐姐染病时跳舞吧？”

莉迪亚表示满意。“就这样决定啦。等到简痊愈后也好，因为那时卡特上尉就很可能回到麦里屯了。只要你举办过舞会，我就要求他们也举办一次。我会向福斯特上校挑明，倘若他不依样照办，那将是莫大的耻辱。”

随后，贝太太带着她们两个小姐妹上路去了。伊丽莎白立刻回到简身边去，全然不理会宾府的姐妹和达西先生怎样品头论足、怎样议论她和她的家人。其实，尽管宾利小姐说了许多俏皮话，一个劲儿拿她的“美丽眼睛”开玩笑，达西先生却没有受她们的挑唆，夹在一起编派她。





第十章


这一天过得和前一天没有多大区别。赫斯特夫人和宾利小姐上午陪了病人几个钟头。简的病情正在一点一点慢慢地好转。傍晚，伊丽莎白走到了客厅里，不过这一次却没有看到他们的赌局。达西先生在写信，而宾利小姐坐在一旁观看。宾利小姐几次打断他的思路，求他附言代她问候他的妹妹。赫斯特先生和宾利先生在玩扑克牌，赫斯特夫人在旁边观战。

伊丽莎白操起针线活，饶有兴趣地听达西和宾利小姐对话。宾利小姐对达西赞不绝口，不是夸他字体洒脱就是夸他的字行距整齐，要不就恭维说他的信写得不长不短。可是，达西却带答不理，对她的话似听非听。这种奇怪的现象完全证实了伊丽莎白对他们二人性格的分析。

“达西小姐收到这样一封信，该会多么高兴呵！”

他没有理睬她。

“你写字快得惊人。”

“你说错了，我的字写得非常慢。”

“一年之中，你得写多少信啊！想想吧，还有那些事务性的信件呢！说起来就叫人心烦！”

“幸亏你不写这种信，写信的是我。”

“请转告令妹，就说我很想见见她。”

“我已经遵照你的意思，告诉过她了。”

“你的笔恐怕不好用吧。让我为你修修，在这方面我可是行家里手。”

“谢谢你的好意，我的笔一向都是自己修。”

“你怎么写得这么规整？”

他默默不语。

“请转告令妹，就说我听到她在竖琴方面取得了进步，为她感到由衷的高兴。千万要让她知道，我非常喜欢她的那幅装饰台桌的设计图案。我觉得，她的图案比格兰特利太太的要漂亮许多。”

“是否请你体谅一下我，下一封信再转达你的喜悦心情吧，这次写不下那么多事情了。”

“噢，这没有关系。反正我一月份就可以见到她了。达西先生，你给她写的信是不是总这么长，总这么动人呢？”

“我的信一般都写得很长；不过，每封信是否都写得很动人，我就说不准啦。”

“我一直觉得，凡是写起长信一挥而就的人，就一定写得很好。”

“卡罗琳，这种恭维的话可不能用在达西身上，”她的哥哥高声说道，“因为他经常反复推敲四个音节的字，做不到一挥而就。是不是这么回事，达西？”

“咱们俩写信的风格迥然有异。”

“告诉你们，”宾利小姐嚷道，“查尔斯写信极端潦草马虎，令人无法想象。他的信上墨迹斑斑，要写的字能漏掉一半。”

“我的念头转得太快，简直来不及写下来。因而，收信人有时看了我的信，觉得我言之无物。”

伊丽莎白说：“宾利先生，你的谦虚态度往往可以遏止别人对你的批评。”

达西说：“假装谦虚往往就是信口开河，有时候简直是转弯抹角地自夸，没有什么比这更具欺骗性了。”

“那么，我刚才说的那几句谦虚的话，究竟是信口开河呢，还是转弯抹角地自夸？”

“要算转弯抹角地自夸，因为你对自己在写信方面的缺点颇为得意。你自以为才思敏捷，只是不屑付诸于笔墨，而且你觉得这无妨大局，或者至少非常有趣。凡是干事利落的人总是自以为了不起，往往不去注意他们是否能把事情做得尽善尽美。你今天上午曾向贝内特太太夸口说，如果你决定离开尼瑟费德，五分钟内就能搬走。这种话无非是炫耀自己的能力和抬高自己的身份。鲁莽的行为只会把本来该做的事情耽搁下来，于人于己都没有真正的好处，这有什么值得称道呢？”

“得了吧，”宾利叫嚷道，“上午说的一些话你到了晚上还唠叨个不停，真是太过分啦。而且，我认为我对自己的分析句句真实，即便现在我也不改变看法。至少我认为自己没必要把干脆果断的作风当做在女士面前炫耀的资本。”

“你也许认为自己讲的是实话。可我绝对不相信，你在离开某个地方时会那么干脆果断。你和其他人一样，只是见机行事罢啦。比如，当你跨上马准备离开时，一位朋友突然说：‘宾利，你最好下个星期再走吧。’那时你很可能会留下不走了。要是他再次挽留，你会拖延上一个月的时间。”

伊丽莎白叫道：“你举的例子只不过说明了宾利先生干事并不是由着性子来。你刚才说他喜欢自夸，而现在你却把他形容得更光彩啦。”

“我简直高兴死啦，”宾利说，“我朋友的话经你这么一变通，倒成了恭维我的话，把我夸成了一朵花。不过，只怕你的解释不符合那位先生的本意。遇到他说的那种情况，我要是一口拒绝了那位朋友的请求，骑马一走了之，他自然就会看得起我了。”

“那时，达西先生就会忘掉你原来的轻率，该为你在实施自己的意图时所表现出的顽强执著的精神拍手称绝了吧？”

“老实讲，这件事我可说不清，得听听达西的高见。”

“你把这种观点说成是我的观点，但我可从来没有承认过。难道你们还想让我作出解释吗？退一步来说，贝内特小姐，即便你所说的情况属实，那位朋友希望他改变计划并请他留下来，可是那仅仅是一种愿望，没有人强迫他非得那样做。”

“随随便便、轻而易举地服从朋友的劝说，在你看来只怕不是长处。”

“缺乏主见的盲目服从，对双方都没有好处。”

“达西先生，我觉得你全盘否定了友谊和感情对一个人的影响力。实际上，一个人如果尊重别人，往往会心甘情愿地服从别人的请求，用不着听人摆出理由要求他那样做。当然，我这里并非单单针对你为宾利先生假设的那种情形。也许，我们应该等到这样的事情发生之后，再讨论他把问题处理得是否得当。不过一般来说，一个朋友要求另一个朋友改变一项不十分重要的决定，而被要求的人未等对方进一步劝说就照办了，你能因此而瞧不起他吗？”

“我们且慢讨论这个问题，不妨先仔细研究一下，那个朋友提出的要求究竟重要到什么程度，两位朋友的交情又深到什么程度，这样好不好？”

“完全同意，”宾利叫嚷道，“请你一点一点列举吧，可别忘了提他们的高矮和胖瘦。贝内特小姐，请别见怪，你也许不知道这在讨论之中该有多么重要。告诉你吧，达西要不是比我高大许多，我才不会对他毕恭毕敬呢。在某些场合、某些地方，达西是个再可恶不过的家伙——特别是在他自己家里、在星期天的晚上，以及当他无所事事的时候。”

达西先生笑了笑。伊丽莎白原来也想笑，可是她觉察出他有几分恼怒，于是便忍住没笑出来。宾利小姐见自己的兄长这般讽刺达西，不由勃然大怒，出面指责他不该胡言乱语。

“我看得出你的意图，宾利，你不喜欢辩论。所以想平息今天的辩论。”达西说。

“也许是这么回事，辩论和争执在我看来没有什么两样。如果你和贝内特小姐能等我离开这个房间后再重新开始，我将感激不尽。那时，你们爱怎么说我就怎么说我吧。”

“我很乐意退出这场辩论，”伊丽莎白声明道，“达西先生还是接着把手中的信写完吧。”

达西先生服从了她的建议，最后终于把信写完了。

他放下手里的笔，接着就要求宾利小姐和伊丽莎白给大家来点音乐听听。宾利小姐轻巧地走到了钢琴跟前，先是客气了一番，请伊丽莎白带个头，可伊丽莎白却更加客气，极端诚恳地推辞了。于是，宾利小姐在钢琴旁坐了下来。

赫斯特太太为妹妹伴唱。就在她们姐妹俩起劲地弹唱时，伊丽莎白边听边翻阅钢琴上的几本乐谱。此刻，她注意到达西先生不时把目光投放到她身上。要说这位了不起的人物射来的是含情脉脉的讯号，她可不敢存此奢望，然而，如果说达西是因为讨厌她才盯着她瞧，那就更讲不通了。最后，她只得这样想：达西之所以注意上她，是因为按他的评判标准她比在座的任何人都邪恶、都更应该受到责难。这种设想并没有令她感到难过，因为她压根不喜欢达西，所以不稀罕他的垂青。

宾利小姐弹了几首意大利歌曲之后，又开始弹轻快的苏格兰小调活跃气氛。达西先生走到伊丽莎白身旁，对她说道：

“贝内特小姐，你愿不愿趁这个机会跳跳苏格兰双人舞？”

她笑而未答。他见她没吱声，感到有些奇怪，于是又问了一遍。

“听见啦！”她说，“你问第一遍时，我就听明白了，只是拿不定主意怎样回答才好。我知道，你是想让我欣然同意，那时你就有理由蔑视我低下的情趣。只可惜我一向喜欢戳穿这类诡计，喜欢捉弄那些存心贬低我的人。因而，我决定告诉你，我根本不想跳什么苏格兰双人舞。现在，你要是敢蔑视我，那你就蔑视吧。”

“我实在没这个胆量。”

伊丽莎白本打算杀杀他的威风，没想到他却表现得如此温顺，于是，她一下子愣住了。其实，她是个非常随和、乖巧的女子，不轻易难为别人。她的嬉笑怒骂叫达西深深着了迷，这在达西以前是从来没有过的。达西的心里不由地暗忖，要不是她的亲戚难登大雅之堂，他一定会陷入危险的爱情漩涡。

宾利小姐见到这种情景，对他们疑神疑鬼，心里的醋劲直朝上翻。她急切地盼望她的好朋友简尽快康复，其中有一种因素就是想撵走伊丽莎白。

她经常把达西和伊丽莎白往一块扯，说他们可以结为夫妻，并说这样的联姻将会给达西带来莫大的幸福。她这样冷嘲热讽，无非是想让达西对那位不速之客产生反感。

次日，当她和达西两人在矮树林里散步时，只听她说：“我希望你如愿以偿、早结良缘。不过，你得委婉地劝劝你的岳母，要她不必遇事都多嘴多舌。你还可以量力而行，帮你的小姨子们治治相思病，不要让她们见了军官便穷追不舍。还有一点比较敏感，真叫人难以启齿。尊夫人有一个小小的毛病，既像是自高自大，又像是缺乏教养，你可得帮她克服呀。”

“关于促进我的家庭幸福方面，还有别的什么建议吗？”

“听着，还有呢！至于你们的姨父和姨妈，也就是菲利普斯夫妇，你得把他们的肖像挂到彭伯里画廊去，就挂在你的那个当过法官的曾伯父遗像旁。他们可是同行业的人，只不过所经营的业务不同罢啦。还有尊夫人伊丽莎白，你可千万别请人为她画像，因为没有一个画家能把她那双美丽的眼睛画得惟妙惟肖。”

“她的眼神的确不容易捕捉，不过那双眼睛的颜色和形状，还有她的眼睫毛，都美得令人倾倒，也许能画得出来。”

他们的谈兴正浓之际，赫斯特太太和伊丽莎白从另外一条路迎头走了过来。

“我不知道你们也要出来散步。”宾利小姐赶忙打了声招呼。她的心里有些发毛，唯恐她刚才和达西的谈话让她们听见了。

“你们太不够意思啦，给我们连说一声也没有，就自顾自地跑到了这里来。”赫斯特太太抱怨道。

随后，她挽起了达西先生另一条空着的臂膀，把伊丽莎白丢到了后边，让她独个儿去走。那条小路恰巧只容得下三人并排走。达西觉得宾家姐妹有失体统，于是连忙说：

“这条路太窄了，人多了显得拥挤了些。咱们最好拐到大道上去。”

伊丽莎白无心和他们待在一起，便哈哈笑了一声说：

“不用啦，不用啦，你们还是走这条路吧。三个人一起走是一种非常巧妙的组合，看起来十分优雅。加上第四个人，就逊色得多啦。再见，诸位。”

她甩开轻松的步子跑掉了。当她放慢脚步，四处溜达时，想起再过一两天便可以回家了，心里不由一阵高兴。





第十一章


女士们用过晚餐后就走了出去。伊丽莎白跑上楼去，她害怕姐姐着凉，便侍候她穿了件衣服，然后陪她来到客厅里。宾家姐妹说了一大堆客套话，对简表示欢迎。在男人们来到前的那一个小时里，她们和蔼可亲，伊丽莎白从来没有见她们这么讨人喜欢过。她们十分健谈，描绘起舞会来纤悉无遗，讲起某桩轶事来涉猎成趣，而讥笑起她们的熟人也有声有色。

可男人们一步入客厅，简就不那么引人注目了。宾利小姐立刻把目光转向了达西，一开始就好像有千言万语要对他说。达西向贝内特小姐问了好，客客气气地祝贺她恢复了健康。赫斯特先生也对简微微鞠了个躬，说他为她感到“高兴万分”。要说宾利的几声问候，可就不是表面文章了，里面充溢着他对简的温馨情意。只有他才真正是其乐融融，柔肠百转。他用了足有半个小时的时间添柴加火，生怕客厅里的温度太低叫简受不了。他请求简坐到壁炉的另一侧，离门口远一些。张罗了一阵之后，他挨着简坐下来，和她说个没完，对其他人几乎理也不理。伊丽莎白坐在对面的角落里做针线活，把这一切看在眼里，感到十分高兴。

喝过茶之后，赫斯特先生提醒他的小姨子让她摆牌桌，但他的建议未被采纳。宾利小姐看得出达西先生不想打牌，所以就连赫斯特先生后来的公开请求也被她拒绝了。她对赫斯特解释说没有人愿意打牌，而其他的人默不作声，这也就算同意了她的说法。赫斯特先生看看没有事情可做，只好平躺在沙发上打起了瞌睡。达西拿起一本书来，宾利小姐也随着看起了书。赫斯特太太全神贯注地摆弄着自己的手镯和戒指，偶尔也加入她弟弟和贝小姐的谈话，跟他们聊上几句。

宾利小姐一面读着自己的书，一面关心着正在看书的达西先生。她不是问这问那，就是看他读到了哪一页。然而，不管她怎样费心，总是无法逗他说话。达西先生问一句答一句，答完后就继续看他的书。到了最后，宾利小姐被拖得疲惫不堪，对自己的书却看不进去了（顺便提提，她所以选中这本书，只是因为这是达西那本书的第二卷）。于是，她张大嘴打了个哈欠，说道：“在晚上这样消遣一下，真叫人感到愉快！我觉得，读书最能给人以乐趣！一个人干别的事情很快就会感到厌倦，而读起书却其乐无穷！将来有了自己的家，我一定要有许多藏书，不然就会觉得生活乏味无聊。”

她见没人理睬她，便又打了一个哈欠，然后把书本抛开，眼光在大厅里溜来溜去，想找点好玩的事情干干。这时，她碰巧听到她的哥哥向贝小姐提起了举办舞会的打算，便蓦然将身子扭过来对他说：

“如此看来，你果真想在尼瑟费德举办舞会，查尔斯？我劝你最好还是先向在场的朋友征求一下意见，然后再作决定。如果我没猜错的话，今天晚上的这些人中间，有些会把跳舞当受洋罪，而不是将其看做一种娱乐。”

“假如你指的是达西，”她的哥哥大声说道，“那他完全可以睡大觉，不用到舞场上去。舞会是非开不可的，等尼科尔斯把一切准备停当，我就下请帖。”

宾利小姐说：“舞会要是能换点新花样，我的兴头会更大些。一般的舞会都千篇一律，叫人看来味同嚼蜡。如果哪一天把内容改一下，以攀谈代替跳舞，意思可就大多啦。”

“那样是蛮有意思，亲爱的卡罗琳，可是却不伦不类，哪还像个舞会呢。”

宾利小姐没有再争论下去。片刻之后，她立起身来，在大厅里来回踱步，故意在达西面前炫耀她婀娜的体态和优雅的步伐。只可惜达西仍在聚精会神地看书，连头也不抬。她绝望之余，决定再作一次尝试，于是冲着伊丽莎白说道：

“伊丽莎白·贝内特小姐，我劝你学学我的样，在屋里来回走走。一动不动地坐了那么长时间，活动一下筋骨可以起到提神的作用。”

伊丽莎白先是感到诧异，但马上还是依了她的意思。这一下，宾利小姐真正的目的达到了——达西先生果然抬起了头，并不知不觉合上了书。他和伊丽莎白一样，也觉察到宾利小姐在变着花样招人注意。两位小姐立刻邀请他和她们一块走走，可是他谢绝了，说他可以想象得来，她们之所以在房间里踱来踱去是出于两个动机，如果他加入她们的行列，不管对任何一个动机都会有妨碍。宾利小姐听不出个名堂来，可她急切想知道他的话是什么意思，于是便问伊丽莎白听明白了没有。

伊丽莎白答道：“根本听不懂，他一定是想拿捏一下咱们。最好不要理他，那样他就会感到失望。”

可是，宾利小姐不管遇到什么事都不愿让达西感到失望，便再三地请求他解释一下他所说的那两个动机。

达西经不起她的央求，于是说道：“其实，我很乐意把我的看法讲给你们听。我认为，你们俩以这种方式消磨时光，是因为你们是推心置腹的朋友，有一些秘密的事儿需要在一起商量，或者是因为你们觉察到，在走动中你们的身段显得格外美。如果你们抱的是第一种动机，我的涉入会妨碍你们的密谈；假如你们是出于第二种动机，那我坐在壁炉旁倒可以更清楚地欣赏到你们优美的体态。”

“讨厌！”宾利小姐喊了起来，“从来没有人对我说过这么恶心的话。亏他说得出口，怎么罚他呢？”

“那还不容易，”伊丽莎白说，“如果你存心折磨惩罚一个人，办法多着呢。你可以戏弄他、嘲笑他……你们俩既然这么熟，你该知道怎样对付他。”

“可我的确不知道呀。不瞒你说，我和他虽来往密切，但我始终未学到对付他的办法。戏弄他这样一个头脑冷静、智力超群的人，谈何容易。不行，不行，我想我们是斗不过他的。要说去嘲笑他，总不能无根无据地放空炮吧。算啦，咱们最好不要惹达西先生了，让他得意他的吧。”

“原来达西先生神圣得不能叫人嘲笑！这可是一种得天独厚的条件，”伊丽莎白嚷道，“但愿这是他一人独享的条件。他这样的熟人要是多了，我可就损失惨重啦。因为我生来爱说爱笑。”

达西说：“宾利小姐对我真是太过奖了。不过，如果一个人把开玩笑当做生活中最重要的事情，那么，即便最聪颖、最杰出的人——不，应该说是最明智、最优秀的行为——也会遭受他的讥笑。”

伊丽莎白说：“是有这样的人，可我希望其中不包括我。我希望我所讥笑的不是明智而优秀的行为。我觉得，愚蠢、荒唐、无聊和自相矛盾的事物才会叫我讥笑，成为我孜孜不倦的攻击对象。当然，我想这些缺点是与你无缘的。”

“也许任何人都不会有这么多缺点。我一生都在琢磨着如何克服容易遭受非议的弱点。”

“比如，虚荣和傲慢就是这样的弱点。”

“虚荣是名副其实的弱点，而傲慢却不然。所谓的傲慢，只是一种优越的思想状态，常被人放在褒义的范畴里。”

伊丽莎白急忙转过了身去，免得别人看到她发笑。

宾利小姐说：“你对达西先生的考试结束了吧？请问结论如何？”

“我通过考试发现，达西先生是个完美无瑕的人。他自己也毫不掩饰地承认了这一点。”

“不对，”达西争辩道，“我可没说过这种冠冕堂皇的话。我的缺点很多，但我希望都是些可以原谅的缺点。至于我的性格，我可不敢自夸。我认为自己过于刚愎自用，为人处世上不善于察言辨色。我的心胸不够坦荡，不能原谅别人的愚蠢和邪恶行为。如果有人冒犯了我，我就耿耿于怀。我的感情比较顽固，而且难以改变。我的脾性也许十分让人讨厌——一旦对某人失去了好感，便再也无法挽回。”

“这的的确确是个缺点！”伊丽莎白大声说道，“对人总是心存芥蒂，的确在你的性格上蒙了一层阴影。不过，你选中这个缺点也可谓煞费苦心啦，我就不能再嘲笑你了。这一点请你放心。”

“我觉得，人们不管性格如何，各自都不可避免地具有某种恶习——一种天生的缺陷，就是受到再好的教育，也无法将其克服掉。”

“而你的缺陷就是仇恨所有的人。”

“你的缺陷么，”达西笑了笑说，“就是有意识地误解所有的人。”

宾利小姐被冷落一旁，便有些厌烦了，于是喊叫了起来：“别争啦，还是听点音乐吧。路易莎，你不怕我吵醒赫斯特先生吧？”

她的姐姐一点也不反对听音乐，于是钢琴被打开了。达西想了一下，并没有因为他和伊丽莎白的谈话被打断而感到惋惜。他觉得自己和伊丽莎白过于亲近了，这是一种危险的苗头。





第十二章


贝家两姐妹商量妥当之后，由伊丽莎白第二天早上修书一封给她的母亲，央求老人家当天就派车来接她们回府。可贝太太却有自己的如意算盘，她打算让两个女儿在尼瑟费德一直住到下个星期二，使简正好待足一星期。所以，她心里老大不情愿提前接她们回来。这样一来，她给女儿的回信就不十分痛快了，至少不符合伊丽莎白的愿望，因为这丫头归家心切。她在信中告诉女儿们说，家里眼下腾不出马来，恐怕要等到下星期二才能套车接她们。她还说，如果宾利先生和他的妹妹挽留她们再住几天，她完全可以答应他们的请求。怎奈伊丽莎白再也不愿在宾府待下去，打定主意要回家。她没怎么指望主人会挽留她们，反而怕人家嫌她们赖下不走。于是，她催促简立即向宾利先生借辆马车。最后，姐妹俩决定把回家的打算讲给主人听，当天上午就离开尼瑟费德，并且要提出向他们借辆车。

主人们听到这话，都表示十分关切，再三地挽留她们，希望她们至少待到第二天再启程。简被他们说服了，她和伊丽莎白的行程就这样拖延了下来。事情决定后，宾利小姐追悔莫及，怨自己不该挽留她们。她虽然喜欢简，但她对伊丽莎白的妒忌和厌恶已经大大超过了这种感情。

宾府的男主人听说她们这么快就要离开，感到十分恋恋不舍，于是便苦口婆心地劝导简，说她的身体还没有彻底复原，路上的颠簸会叫她受不了。可是简执意不肯改变计划，并且认为这样做是对的。

达西先生却认为这是条好消息，因为他觉得伊丽莎白在尼瑟费德住的时间太久了，对他产生的吸引力已经超过了限度。宾利小姐醋意大发，待伊丽莎白粗暴无礼，对他的态度也一反常态，一个劲取笑他。他考虑得相当周全，觉得自己的一言一行都要特别当心，目前绝对不能对伊丽莎白流露出丝毫的爱慕，免得她存非分之心去操纵他的幸福。他认为，假如伊丽莎白真的有这种非分的念头，那么他在最后的一天里就得拿出实际行动，要么巩固他们之间的感情，再不然就粉碎她的企图。目标明确之后，他在星期六这天对伊丽莎白带答不理，从早晨到晚上对她讲的话没有超过十句。他们俩也曾单独待过半个小时，但他却正襟危坐、用心读书，瞧也不瞧她一眼。

星期日早晨做过祈祷后，大家皆大欢喜地分手了。宾利小姐一下子对伊丽莎白礼貌了起来，对简的柔情蜜意也增加了几分。辞别时，她告诉简说，她盼望着有机会能和简在浪搏恩或者尼瑟费德再度重逢。接着，她亲亲热热拥抱了简，甚至还跟伊丽莎白握了握手。上路之后，伊丽莎白显得喜气洋洋、情绪高涨。

贝妈妈见她们不期而至，心里先有几分不快。她没想到她们竟会提前回家，于是便抱怨她们光知道给人添麻烦，并说简要是不听话，还会感冒发烧的。倒是贝爸爸心疼女儿，嘴上虽然没说几句欢迎词，心里却乐开了花。在这段时间里，他感觉到了两位年长的女儿在家中所起的重要作用。晚上一家人聚在一处聊天时，要是简和伊丽莎白不在场，就没有劲，几乎连一点意思也没有。

玛丽还是以前的老样子，仍在潜心钻研低音法以及人性问题。她把一些才写的札记拿给两个姐姐看，还针对陈腐的道德观念发表了一通时髦的见解。凯瑟琳和莉迪亚也告诉了她们一些新闻，但性质却不同。据她们报道，自从上个星期三以来民兵团里又出现了许多新鲜事和有趣的消息——最近，她们的姨父又宴请了几名军官；一个兵士遭到了鞭笞；人们议论纷纷，说福斯特快要当新郎了。





第十三章


第二天吃早饭的时候，贝内特先生对他的太太说：“希望你今天把晚饭准备得丰盛些，家里可能要来客人。”

“你指的是哪位客人，亲爱的？莫非是夏洛特·卢卡斯要来串门？除了她，绝不会再有第二个人到咱家来。用咱们的家常便饭款待她已经够抬举她了，因为她在家里并不一定有这样的口福哩。”

“我所说的客人是位绅士，并且是个稀客。”

贝太太的双眼进发出异彩。“嗬，要来一位绅士，还是个稀客！那准是宾利先生喽。我说简，你怎么连点口风都没有漏过？你这个小滑头！哈哈，宾利先生能到咱们家来，真让人高兴死啦。不过——老天爷呀！太不凑巧啦，今天家里连条鱼都没剩下。莉迪亚，我的好宝贝，快摇铃唤希尔来，我有话跟他说。”

“不是宾利先生要来，而是一个和我素昧平生的人。”她的丈夫说。

这话叫全家人都大吃一惊。紧接着，贝太太和五个女儿穷追不舍地盘问起他来，这倒使他颇为得意。

他和家里人兜了一阵圈子，然后才不紧不慢地解释道：“大约在一个月以前，我收到了一封信。当时我觉得事情比较棘手，需早作决断，于是我在两个星期前写了回信。告诉你们吧，那封信是我的表侄柯林斯先生发来的。我死了之后，他可以随时将你们赶出这幢房子。”

“别说啦，亲爱的！”贝太太喊叫道，“听见你提这种事，实在叫人受不了。求求你，别再说那个可憎的家伙了。你的家业不能留给自己的孩子，却要旁落他人，这可是天底下再残酷不过的事情。我要是你的话，早就想出办法来改变这种状况了。”

简和伊丽莎白试图把继承权的问题讲给她听。其实，她们以前也为此费了不少口舌，只可惜贝太太就是明白不过来。她老是满腔悲愤地抱怨这个残酷的世道，说谁都不该把他们的家业从五个女儿手中抢走，去交给一个他们素不相识的人。

“这的确是件极不公道的事，”这时只听贝内特先生说，“柯林斯先生要是继承了浪搏恩，就是造下了永远也洗不清的罪孽。不过，如果你能听听这封信的内容，了解一下他对此事的态度，你心里的火气或许会消一些。”

“不，我是不会原谅他的。他根本就不应该假惺惺地给你写信，实在是太欺人了。我讨厌这种虚情假意的人。他为什么就不学学他那过世的父亲，和你公开吵一架呢？”

“做事是应该光明磊落，不过，那小子似乎还懂得些伦理孝道，你听听信就明白了。”


尊敬的先生：

您和先父之间曾有过龃龉，对此我深感不安。自先父不幸辞世之后，我一直希望能弥补这个裂痕，但因为心里有些顾虑，所以迟迟未决。我当时觉得，先父既然一向与阁下以仇为快，而我如果和阁下修好言和，未免有些辱没先父的气节。（注意听下文，贝内特太太。）然而，现在我却坚定了与阁下言归于好的决心，因为我在复活节那天接受了圣职。承蒙已故刘易斯·德布尔爵士的遗孀凯瑟琳夫人普降恩泽，提拔我担任该教区的教士。此后我可以竭诚尽忠，恭侍夫人左右，奉行英国教会的各项礼仪范典，以报夫人的雨露之恩，这真是三生有幸啊。作为一名教士，我觉得自己有责任尽我之能力所及，使家家和睦、户户和谐。我自信我的这番好意可以得到人们的理解和赞扬。至于继承浪搏恩财产的事情，阁下大可不必介意，不要因此使阁下拒绝了我求和的橄榄枝。我侵犯了令爱们的利益，对此我忐忑不安、万分抱歉。不过请阁下放心，我愿尽一切努力补偿令爱们的损失——详情容日后面谈。假如您不反对我到贵府做客，我十分愿意于十一月十八日，星期一，四点钟拜谒您和您的家人，甚或在府上叨扰至下星期六晚为止。这对于我毫无不便之处，因为我偶尔有事不能主持礼拜日的仪式是可以得到凯瑟琳夫人谅解的，只要临时再派一名教士来就行了。尊敬的先生，请您代为转达我对尊夫人及令爱们的敬意。

您的祝福者及朋友





威廉·柯林斯

十月十五日写于肯特郡韦斯特汉姆

附近的亨斯福德



“今天下午四点钟，这位和平的使者可能就要大驾光临啦，”贝内特先生一面叠信，一面说道，“据我看，他像是个有仁有义、礼致彬彬的青年，一定能成为一个可贵的朋友。凯瑟琳夫人要是再开开恩，让他常来走走，我们就能和他把关系处熟。”

“他对咱们的女儿倒有些人情味。他要是真的决定补偿她们的损失，我绝不会给他泼冷水。”

“弄不清他究竟要对我们有什么样的补偿，不过他既然有这份心意也就十分难能可贵了。”简说道。

伊丽莎白最感兴趣的是，这位和平使者对凯瑟琳夫人竟是那样顶礼膜拜，而且他能够诚心诚意为教民们服务，随时为他们主持洗礼、婚礼和葬礼。

“我想他一定是个怪人，”她说，“实在难以叫人捉摸得透。他的文笔似乎有些浮夸。因为将要继承一笔遗产，就向人表示道歉，他到底想说明什么？您能说他是个明白人吗，爸爸？”

“我觉得他不像是个明白人，宝贝，而且很可能恰恰相反。他的信既显得奴颜婢膝，又是那样狂妄自大，很能说明问题。真想赶快见到他。”

“就那封信的写作技巧而言，倒像是无懈可击，”玛丽说，“连那套有关橄榄枝的破旧玩意儿，经他的笔锋一转，倒别有情趣了。”

在凯瑟琳和莉迪亚看来，那封信也好，写信人也好，都没有一点意思。反正，她们的表兄绝不会穿着红制服来。在这几个星期里，她们一心迷恋着红制服，而不愿和穿其他颜色服装的人来往。至于她们的母亲，原来的一腔怨气已经给柯林斯先生的信打消了不少，她现在准备心平气和地接待他，这叫她的丈夫和女儿们惊讶万分。

柯林斯先生准时来到了，受到了贝家老老少少的热情欢迎。贝先生说话不多，而贝太太和几个女儿却跃跃欲试，很想畅谈一通。要说这位柯林斯先生，根本就不需要别人为他引话题，因为他不像是一个沉默寡言的人。他今年二十五岁，长得人高马大，表情庄严高贵，举止却有些拘泥呆板。他刚一落座，就恭维起了贝太太，说她养育出了一群出类拔萃的女儿。他说他对几位小姐的美貌早已有耳闻，而今面睹其芳容，才知道她们比传说的还美。他还说，他坚信贝太太到时候一定会看到女儿们都嫁个好人家。在座的有几个不大爱听他的甜言蜜语，而贝太太却听得十分顺耳，只听她说：

“一看就知道你是个好心人。但愿她们以后能嫁好人家，否则她们就要穷困潦倒啦。有些事情说起来就是古里古怪的。”

“您大概是说产业的继承权问题吧？”

“对啦！我说的就是这件事，先生。你得承认，这对于我可怜的女儿们真是件不幸的事。我并不想怪你，因为我也知道，世界上这一类事情全靠命运决定。一份家业一旦涉及继承权问题，就无从得知会落到谁的手里了。”

“太太，我深知这件事苦了漂亮的表妹们。在这个问题上我原本有许多话要说，可又不敢莽撞冒失。不过，我可以向表妹们保证，我到这儿来是向她们表示敬慕的。目前我也不想多说，也许等到将来我们处熟了以后……”

正在这时，他的话让招呼开饭的叫声打断了。贝家姐妹们听了他的话，不由相互传递着笑眼。柯林斯先生所敬慕的不仅仅是这些千金，只见他把客厅、餐厅以及里面的家具全部检查了一遍，并且赞不绝口。要是在往常，贝太太听了这些漂亮话一定会喜不自禁，可现在她心存疑虑，觉得他把这一切都看成了他将要继承的财产，于是，她的心里产生了几分惆怅。除此之外，柯林斯先生还针对晚饭说了一通好听的话，并请求主人告诉他，究竟是哪位表妹烧得这一手好菜。这一次，贝太太一点没客气，而是声色俱厉地告诉他，贝家现在还雇得起像样的炉头，用不着女儿们下厨帮灶。柯林斯先生请求原谅，说他不该出语伤人。贝太太马上缓和了语调，声称她并没有怪罪他的意思。尽管如此，柯林斯先生还是不放心，又一连声地道歉了一刻钟之久。





第十四章


吃饭的时候，贝先生几乎一句话也没说。可是等仆人们退下去后，他就觉得时机已成熟，该跟客人谈谈了。于是，他扯出了一个柯林斯感兴趣的话题，料想他讲起这方面的事一定会滔滔不绝、口若悬河。他说柯林斯能有这样一个女恩主，真是他的福气，又说凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人处处关心他、样样为他着想，实在难能可贵。这个话题果然选得恰到好处。柯林斯先生一提起那位夫人的恩德，就说个没完。此刻，他的态度变得更加严肃了，只听他带着非常得意的神气说，他一辈子都没有见过任何有身份的人能像凯瑟琳夫人那样和蔼可亲，那样体恤民情。他很荣幸，曾经当着她的面布过两次教。凯瑟琳夫人很器重他，对他的能力颇为欣赏，并且还请他到罗辛斯吃了两次饭。在上个星期六的晚上，夫人还请他到府上玩过牌呢。他认识的人当中，许多人都认为凯瑟琳夫人十分傲慢，可是他却觉得她和蔼可亲。夫人跟他说话，总是把他当做一个有身份的人一样对待。她丝毫不反对他和邻居们来往，也不反对他偶尔离开教区一两个星期去走亲访友。她甚至还过问他的个人问题，希望他能寻觅到如意伴侣，早结良缘。有一次，她竟然屈尊俯就，到了他贫寒的家中，当时恰逢他在布置房间。她对他所干的活表示十二分满意，甚至还不吝赐教，吩咐他在小阁楼里多添几个架子。

贝太太说：“我认为这一切都做得十分体面周全。看来她的确是个相当不错的女人。可惜一般的贵妇人都比不上她。她住得离你很近吗，先生？”

“寒舍所在的地方，与夫人住的罗辛斯庄园只隔着一条小路。”

“你说过她是个寡妇吧，先生？她有没有子女呢？”

“她只有一个女儿，是罗辛斯庄园以及一大笔钱财的合法继承人。”

“啧啧！”贝太太摇晃着脑袋，感叹了起来，“那她比许多姑娘都富有啦。她是一个什么样的小姐？模样长得漂亮吗？”

“她是个非常迷人的小姐。凯瑟琳夫人亲口说过，真要是论起容貌，小姐比天下最漂亮的女性还强上几分，因为她不仅美丽动人，还具有高贵的气质。只可惜她体弱多病，不能够向多才多艺的方向发展。不然，她一定琴棋书画样样精通。这话我是听她的家庭女教师讲的，此人现在还和她们母女住在一起。德布尔小姐待人再亲切不过了，常常不拘名分，乘着她那辆小马车路过寒舍。”

“她觐见过国王吗？在进过宫的淑女中间，我不记得有她的名字。”

“只可惜她身体状况欠佳，不能到京城去。那天我还对凯瑟琳夫人说，英国王宫因此而失去了一颗最绚丽的明珠。夫人似乎很喜欢我的这种说法。不瞒你们说，无论在什么场合，我都爱说几句乖巧的奉承话，以讨得夫人小姐们的欢心。我不止一次跟凯瑟琳夫人说过，她那迷人的女儿天生就是当伯爵夫人的命，将来不管嫁个名声多么显赫的姑爷，小姐都不会因此而身价百倍，反而要由小姐为姑爷增光添彩。凯瑟琳夫人听了感到非常高兴，所以我觉得自己有责任多献献这类殷勤。”

“你判断得很准确，”贝内特先生说，“而且，你的这种巧言巧语恭维人的本领，实在惹人羡慕。请问，那些奉承话是临时随口说出来的，还是事先想好的？”

“大多是临场发挥出来的。不过，有时候我也喜欢预先想好一些能适用于一般场合的委婉动听的言词，并且在讲话的时候总要装出一副随便、自然的样子。”

果然不出贝先生所料。他的表侄正像他想象的那样荒唐可笑。贝先生有滋有味地聆听着他的评价，同时在表面上全然不动声色。他除了不时用眼瞟瞟伊丽莎白，并不需要旁人分享他的这份喜悦心情。

到了吃茶点的时候，柯林斯已经被迷魂汤灌得晕乎乎了。贝先生高高兴兴把他带回客厅，在那儿用了茶点，然后又高高兴兴地请他为太太小姐们读书助兴。柯林斯满口答应，随即就有人取了本书来。他一见是部小说（显然是从流通图书馆借来的），便把身子朝后缩，连声请求在座的人原谅，说他从来不读这种书。吉蒂一听便诧异地用眼瞪着他，莉迪亚也不可思议地叫出了声。无奈，姐妹们又给他取了几本书来。这次，柯林斯考虑再三，选了一本福代斯的《布教集》。莉迪亚目瞪口呆地看着他打开书，听他以单调乏味、严肃认真的声调朝下念。可是没等他读完三页书，她就打断了他：

“妈妈，您知道不知道，菲利普斯姨父说要解雇理查德？真要是那样，福斯特上校就会把理查德雇去。这些话是姨妈在星期六那天亲口告诉我的。明天我还要到麦里屯打听详情，顺便问问丹尼先生什么时候从城里回来。”

两个姐姐忙叫莉迪亚住嘴，可是柯林斯已经被惹恼了，只见他把书一撂，说道：

“我发现年轻小姐们对正经书一点也不感兴趣，尽管这些书是专门为她们撰写的。老实说，这不能不叫我惊奇。我认为，聆听圣哲的谆谆教诲，对她们大有好处。不过，我也不愿意勉强我年轻的表妹。”

说罢，他转向贝内特先生，要求跟他玩十五子棋。贝先生答应了他的请求，说这倒是个明智的做法，让姑娘们自己去取乐吧。贝太太和几位女儿极有礼貌地一起向他赔不是，请他原谅莉迪亚的多嘴多舌，并且保证说，他若是继续念书，再不会发生这类事情。柯林斯却安慰她们说，他一点也不记恨小表妹，绝不怨她有意冒犯。表明了心迹之后，他和贝先生坐到了另一张桌子的旁边，做好了下棋的准备。





第十五章


柯林斯先生算不上一个明白人。他虽然受过教育，又在社会上闯荡过，但是先天的缺陷却没有得到多少弥补。他长了这么大，大部分岁月是在他那个目不识丁的守财奴父亲的教导下度过的。他上过大学，但只是勉勉强强混了几个学期，连一个有用的朋友也没交上。父亲的严厉管教使他自小就养成了唯唯诺诺的习性。然而，后来他年纪轻轻就发了一笔意外之财，过上了养尊处优的日子，这就难免使他飘飘然自大起来，不再像从前那样谦卑恭顺了。一个偶然的机会使他受到了凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人的赏识，于是他红运亨通，补了亨斯福德教区一个牧师的空缺。他一方面敬仰凯瑟琳夫人的显赫身份，毕恭毕敬地将她视为自己的女恩主，另一方面又非常看重自己，看重自己做教士的权威和做教区长的权力，这些因素造就了他一身兼有傲慢与忠顺、自负与谦卑的双重性格。

现在住上了舒适的房子，并有一笔可观的收入，他便想到了结婚。他所以要和浪搏恩村的这家人握手言和，就是想在他们府上找个太太。如果表妹们真像大家传说的那样美丽可爱，他打算给自己挑一个。这就是他为继承她们父亲的财产所制订的补偿计划和赎罪方案。他认为这是个绝妙的方案，既妥善得体，又充分显示了他的慷慨大度。

见到几位表妹之后，他仍没有改变初衷。简的那张妩媚的脸蛋，更加坚定了他的信念，坚定了他那优先考虑老大的严肃态度。头一天晚上，他把简作为择偶的对象，但是到了第二天早晨，情况便发生了变化。早饭前，他和贝太太密谈了十五分钟，先谈到的是他那幢教士住宅，后来又自然而然过渡到了他的心愿，他说希望能在浪搏恩物色一个太太。贝太太听得笑逐颜开，说了一通勉励的话，不过却奉劝他不要选择简。她说：

“至于我的几个小女儿……我虽然不敢打保票，给你明确的答复，但据我所知，她们目前都还没有对象。要说大女儿么，我必须告诉你……这也是我的责任……她可能马上就要订婚啦。”

柯林斯先生只得放弃了简，改选伊丽莎白。他的这种转变完成得迅雷不及掩耳，是在贝太太拨火的那短短的一瞬间结束的。说起来这也是顺理成章的事，因为伊丽莎白从年龄和容貌上都仅次于她的姐姐。

贝太太听后如获至宝，心想她马上就可以嫁出两个女儿了。昨天她连提都不愿提的这个人，现在却深深赢得了她的欢心。

莉迪亚又提起了到麦里屯去的打算。除了玛丽，几位姐姐都愿意陪她一道去。贝内特先生急于把柯林斯支开，好独自在书房清静清静，便请他也同去散散心。原来，在吃过早饭之后，柯林斯就追随他进了书房，硬赖在那儿不走，装模作样地翻阅一部极厚的书，但实际上却喋喋不休地和他谈论自己在亨斯福德的住宅及花园，搅得他心烦意乱。平时，贝先生在书房里可以图个清闲和安静。他曾经对伊丽莎白说过，他可以在别的房间里应酬愚蠢自大的人，但他却不愿让这种人涉足于他的书房。所以，当他听女儿们说要出去散步，便当机立断地请柯林斯相陪。其实，柯林斯先生本来就不是读书的料，陪人散散步倒还合适，于是他喜上眉梢地合上那本大部头书走了。

一路上，柯林斯夸夸其谈、废话连篇，表妹们只得客客气气地随声附和，就这样来到了麦里屯。这时，两个小表妹可就不再答理他了。她们立即把目光在街头溜来溜去，寻觅着军官的踪影。除了商店橱窗里陈列的漂亮帽子或者时髦平纹布，任什么也无法令她们分心。

过不多久，诸位小姐注意上了一位素不相识的年轻人。此人有一副十足的绅士派头，正和一名军官在街对面漫步。那位军官正是丹尼先生，莉迪亚到麦里屯来就是为了打听他是否已从伦敦返回。他看见贝家众姐妹，冲她们鞠了个躬。可小姐们的注意力都让那位陌生男子的风度吸引去了，都很想了解他是何人。吉蒂和莉迪亚决定去探听一下，于是就装出到街对面店里买东西的样子，领头穿过了马路。说来也巧，当她们走上人行道时，那两位先生也掉过了头朝回走，和她们撞了个正着。丹尼先生立即和她们打招呼，并提出要给她们介绍一下他的朋友威克姆先生（此人于昨天和他一道从城里回来）。他高兴地说，威克姆先生已被任命为他们团里的军官。这真是再好也没有了，因为这位年轻人只要戎装加身，就会更加潇洒迷人。他的外表的确是无可挑剔的，没有一处不具有美的魅力：那清秀的眉目、挺拔的身材和优雅的谈吐，样样都叫人称道。一经介绍，他就主动而热情地说起了话——既热情，又很谦虚，掌握得非常有分寸。就这样，大伙儿站立在街头，一见如故地畅谈起来。谈兴正浓的时候，他们听到了一阵哒哒的马蹄声，寻声望去，看到达西和宾利两人骑着马沿大街跑了过来。那两人在人堆里认出了贝家姐妹，于是连忙来到她们身旁，和她们寒暄了一通。宾利说的话较多，主要是讲给贝内特小姐听的。他说他路过这里，正要到浪搏恩去向她问候。达西欠了欠身子，证明他说的都是实话。达西一来就只顾盯着伊丽莎白瞧，当他下了决心把目光移开时，突然看到了那位陌生人。伊丽莎白见到他们俩那副面面相觑、不知所措的神情，感到十分惊奇。两个人都变了脸色，一个煞白，一个通红。僵持了一会儿，威克姆先生用手碰了碰帽檐，达西先生也勉强还了一个礼。这到底是怎么回事呢？既令人费解，又叫人忍不住想弄个明白。

宾利先生似乎没有注意到这幕情景，又说了会儿话，随后便告别了大家，和他的朋友骑马走啦。

丹尼先生和威克姆先生陪着小姐们走到菲利普斯先生的家门口，尽管莉迪亚小姐再三请他们进屋，甚至连菲利普斯太太也打开客厅的窗户，大声跟着邀请，他们两人还是鞠躬告辞了。

菲利普斯太太每次见到外甥女们，都高兴万分。近几日没见两个大外甥女，她对她们格外热乎。她说，想不到又没有遣马车去接简和伊丽莎白，她们姐俩竟突然间自己跑了回来。据她所言，若不是在街上碰见琼斯先生药店里的伙计，告诉她贝家姐妹已经回府，用不着再往尼瑟费德送药了，那她真的连一点消息都不知道呢。闲话说到此处，简向她介绍了柯林斯先生，使她的注意力转移到了柯林斯的身上。菲利普斯太太客客气气地对他表示欢迎，而柯林斯也倍加客气地答谢了她，并且道歉说，他与太太素昧平生，不该贸然闯到府上来，不过令他聊以自慰的是，把他引荐给太太的几位小姐和他沾亲带故，因此他的冒昧打扰还是情有可原的。菲利普斯太太见他如此温文尔雅，不由肃然起敬。于是，她仔细端详起了眼前的这位年轻人。但没过多久，贝家的千金们便七嘴八舌询问起了街上那位陌生人的情况。可惜菲利普斯太太提供的净是她们已经知道的消息——那位陌生男子是丹尼先生从伦敦带来的，将要在本郡民兵团担任中尉的军衔。她还说，那位威克姆先生在街上溜达的时候，她把他整整观察了一个小时。令人扫兴的是，他现在已不见了踪影，不然吉蒂和莉迪亚也会仔细打量他。而眼下从窗前经过的只有几个小军官。与威克姆先生一比较，他们简直成了“愚蠢、讨厌的家伙”。其中有几名军官明天要来菲利普斯家赴宴，姨妈说，如果她们一家能于明晚从浪搏恩赶来，那她就让丈夫去请威克姆先生。贝家姐妹欣然同意了这个主意。菲利普斯太太当众宣布，明天要举办一场热闹有趣的抓彩牌游戏，玩完之后再吃点热餐。一想到如此欢乐的场景，就令人兴奋不已，因此大家在分手时，情绪都非常高涨。出门的时候，柯林斯先生又一次表示了歉意，主人不失礼节地告诉他说，他没必要过于客气。

回家的路上，伊丽莎白把她所看到的达西和威克姆之间出现的那幕场景讲给简听。假如简知道那两位先生有什么纠葛，那她一定会为其中的一方或者双方辩解。可遗憾的是，她和她的妹妹一样，弄不清那究竟是怎么回事。

柯林斯回来之后，把殷勤好客的菲利普斯太太称赞了一通，叫贝太太听了非常满意。他郑重其事地说，除了凯瑟琳夫人母女之外，他还从未见过如此典雅的女性。菲利普斯太太虽说和他萍水相逢，待他却非常体贴热情，甚至还特意邀请他也参加明晚的宴会。之所以能享此殊荣，他觉得这要归于他和贝家有亲戚关系，但不管怎样，如此热情友好的人，他平生可没遇到过第二个。





第十六章


年轻人们到姨妈家赴宴的事，没有遇到阻力。柯林斯先生却犹豫了起来，不忍心把贝内特夫妇整晚丢在家中，可老两口执意要他应邀前往。于是，他和五个表妹乘马车准时赶到了麦里屯。姑娘们一走进客厅，便欣喜地听说威克姆先生已经接受了她们姨父的邀请，现就在菲府。

这个消息公布完，大家一齐坐了下来。柯林斯悠闲自得地四处张望，欣赏着周围的环境。客厅偌大的面积和精美的摆设叫他赞叹不已，他说自己仿佛置身于罗辛斯那间消夏小餐厅里。这个比喻开头并不怎么令人感到高兴。后来，他把凯瑟琳夫人的一间客厅作为例子描绘了一遍，说光是里面的壁炉架就价值八百英镑，菲利普斯夫人这才明白了罗辛斯是怎样一个地方以及它的主人是怎样一个人物，于是她也就体会到了这个比喻的全部力量。现在，即便把她的家比做罗辛斯管家的住宅，她也不会在意啦。

柯林斯津津乐道地形容着雍容华贵的凯瑟琳夫人以及她富丽堂皇的府邸，有时也偶尔穿插几句，有意夸耀夸耀他那寒舍和他的修缮工作，就这样一直自得其乐地唠叨到男宾们进来为止。他发现菲利普斯太太听得很专心，而且越听越夸他了不起，还决计把他的话尽快传播给邻居。贝家的几个小姐听不进表兄的唠叨，想弹琴又弹不成，便百无聊赖、漫不经心地临摹起壁炉架上的瓷器，画完就待在那儿端详来、打量去。她们觉得时间过得是那样慢，不过，这种痛苦的等待最后还是结束了。男宾们终于露面了。威克姆先生一步入客厅，伊丽莎白就觉得，无论是上次见到他的时候，还是以后想起他的时候，她都被一种疯狂的仰慕心情所左右。一般来说，本郡的军官都体体面面，具有绅士的风度，而今晚赴宴的军官又是他们当中的精英。不过，他们在人品、相貌、风度及步态上和威克姆先生相比，就可谓小巫见大巫了。这就像他们比那位肥头大耳、老气横秋、满口葡萄酒味、尾随他们走进屋的菲利普斯姨父优越得多一样。

威克姆先生是今晚最幸福的男宾，因为几乎每一位女士的目光都在跟着他转。伊丽莎白则是今晚最幸福的女宾，因为威克姆最后坐在了她的身旁。威克姆立即和颜悦色地和她攀谈起来，虽然净扯些诸如今夜要下雨、雨季可能即将来临之类的闲话，可是伊丽莎白觉得，只要说话人把话说得巧妙，即使最平凡、最乏味、最陈腐的话题也会趣味横生。

面对威克姆和其他军官这样的劲敌，要想博得女士们的青睐，柯林斯先生就显得微不足道了。年轻的女士们的确把他看不上眼，只有好心的菲利普斯太太才偶尔听他说几句话，并留心关照他，不断为他斟酒和添松饼。

牌桌摆好之后，柯林斯总算找到了报答女主人的机会，坐下来陪她玩惠斯特[1]。

“我对这种游戏一窍不通，”他说，“可是我很愿意把它学会，因为处于我这样的地位……”菲利普斯太太非常感激他能和她一道玩，却没心思听他解释这样做的理由。

威克姆先生没有玩惠斯特，而是被伊丽莎白和莉迪亚高高兴兴地请到另一张桌旁，坐在两姐妹的中间。开头，莉迪亚谈笑风生，似乎大有将他据为已有的趋势，好在她也同样喜欢摸彩牌，很快就全心全意投入游戏之中，心里只想着如何下赌注和如何叫彩，顾不得和人说闲话了。威克姆这才能够和伊丽莎白从容不迫地交谈。伊丽莎白非常愿意听他说话，但并不指望能从他口中听到她最想知道的事情——他和达西过去的关系。对于那位先生，她甚至提也不敢提。然而，她的好奇心却出乎意料地得到了满足。这方面的话题是由威克姆主动扯起的。他先是问尼瑟费德离麦里屯有多远，伊丽莎白回答了他之后，他又吞吞吐吐地问达西在那个地方待了多久。

“大约一个月了，”伊丽莎白说。她不愿放过这个话题，于是紧接着说，“听说，他是德比郡的一个大财主。”

“是的。他在那里的财产很可观，每年有一万镑的进项。要想了解有关他的情况，谁也没有我知道得确切，因为我从小就与他们家有一种特殊关系。”

伊丽莎白由不得露出惊异的神色。

“贝内特小姐，你昨天也许看到我们见面时那副冷冰冰的样子了，难怪你听我这样说会感到奇怪。顺便问一句，你和达西先生很熟吗？”

“我才不愿与他深交呢，”伊丽莎白情绪激昂地高声说，“我和他在尼瑟费德一起待过四天，觉得他很讨厌。”

“他究竟招人讨厌还是惹人喜欢，我是没有权力也没有资格发表意见的。我认识他的时间太久了，也过于熟悉他啦，作不出公正的判断。我的观点不可能不带偏见。不过，我觉得你对他的看法会叫人们感到震惊。这里反正都是你自家人，要是换个地方你大概就不会这么冲动地谈论他了。”

“老实讲，除了尼瑟费德之外，我不管到了哪户邻家都会这么说。哈福德郡根本就没有人喜欢他。他那种傲慢的样子，谁见了谁讨厌。你绝对听不到这儿的人说他半句好话。”

“无论是他还是别人，如果没有过错就遭到抨击，我会感到遗憾的。不过，这种现象极少发生在他身上。世人让他那显赫的财势和高贵的出身蒙住了双眼，被他那目空一切、盛气凌人的架势吓破了胆，只好顺着他的心意去评价他。”

“我尽管和他不太熟，可我觉得他脾气很坏。”

威克姆听后只是摇头不已。

到了该讲话的时候，只听他问道：“他在这个地方是不是还要待很久？”

“无可奉告。不过，在尼瑟费德时，我没听说他要走呀。希望他在这儿不会影响你到民兵团走马上任的计划。”

“这是不可能的。我绝不会让他吓跑。倘若他不愿见到我，那他可以躲到别处去。我们俩关系处得很糟，一见他，我就心口疼。可是我犯不着躲躲藏藏。我要让天下人都知道他是怎样肆虐无辜，他的所作所为是怎样令人痛心。贝内特小姐，他那位过世的父亲达西老先生，可是个少见的大好人，也是我最真挚的朋友。每当我同现在的这位达西在一起的时候，就免不了要勾起他父亲给我留下的千丝万缕温馨的回忆，免不了从心底里感到痛楚。他对我的态度真是可恶之极。不过我可以告诉你，他的一切过失我都可以原谅，就是不能原谅他辜负先父的期望、辱没先父的名声这件事。”

伊丽莎白愈加兴趣盎然，拿出全副精力去听。由于所接触的是个敏感的问题，所以她不便追根究底。

随后，威克姆又谈起了一些一般性的问题，诸如麦里屯、左邻右舍以及社交之类。看样子，他对自己所见到的一切都颇为满意。特别是在提到社交方面的事时，他的谈吐既文雅，又明显带有献殷勤的味道。

“我之所以要来这儿入伍，”他接着说道，“是因为我知道该郡的民兵团是一支可亲可敬的部队，而此地的居民是善良友好的人民。我的朋友丹尼老是吊我的胃口，说他们的营房漂亮舒适，麦里屯的百姓待他们亲如家人，还说他们在这里结识了许多好朋友。我承认，我需要与人交往。作为一个失意潦倒的人，我在精神上经受不住孤独感的折磨。工作和朋友对我来说是必不可少的。我原来并不打算过戎马生活，但由于环境所迫，我只好选择了这条道路。牧师才应该是我的职业，因为我从小就受着这方面的教育。如果咱们刚才谈到的那位先生成全我的话，我现在就能享受丰厚的牧师待遇了。”

“真是如此？！”

“是的。老达西先生曾留下遗言，说那个最好的牧师职位一空下来，就由我填补。他是我的教父，非常疼爱我。我简直无法用语言形容他对我的温情。他本想让我过丰衣足食的日子，并且满以为自己的心愿已了。可谁想那个牧师的职位空下来时，却送给了别人。”

“天哪！”伊丽莎白失声喊道，“怎么会有这种事？老人的遗愿怎么能被束之高阁、置之不理呢？你为什么不向法院起诉呢？”

“那份遗嘱缺乏正式的手续，所以我注定会败诉。作为一个体面的人不应该怀疑老人的遗愿，可是这位达西先生却偏偏要怀疑。或者说，他把先父的心愿当做是有条件的，于是便指责我挥霍无度，行为鲁莽，不配得到提拔。真是欲加之罪，何患无辞！那个牧师的职位空下来时，我正好到了接受圣职的年龄，可是却眼睁睁看着它旁落他人之手。我实在说不出自己到底做错了什么事情，要受到这样的惩罚。我性情耿直，说话没有遮掩，有时难免会在别人面前直言不讳地谈论他，这样他就觉得我过于放肆。仅此而已。事情明摆着，我们属于截然不同的两种人，所以他就记恨在心。”

“真是骇人听闻！应该叫他当众丢脸。”

“迟早会有人那么做——但绝不是我。只要我一天不忘记他的父亲，我就不会蔑视和揭露他。”

伊丽莎白非常敬佩他高尚的情操，觉得他在表露内心的感情时越发显得英俊。

过了一会儿，她说道：“他究竟居心何在？是什么使他如此冷酷无情？”

“是对我的深恶痛绝——我认为这种憎恶从某种程度而言只能是出自对我的妒忌。已故的达西老先生若是不那样疼爱我，他的儿子待我或许会厚道些。我坚信，正是由于老人家待我恩重如山，才惹恼了他，使他自小就记恨我。他心胸狭窄，容不得我和他竞争——因为受宠的往往是我。”

“想不到达西先生这么坏。虽说我一直讨厌他，却不知他如此下作。我以前只觉得他瞧不起人，谁料他竟然道德败坏、蓄意报复，干出这种伤天害理、毫无人性的事来。”

她沉思了片刻，接着又继续说道：“我记得，他有一天在尼瑟费德吹牛时说，他秉性不饶人，总是结怨记仇。这种性格的人，让人想起来感到后怕。”

“我的意见是靠不住的，”威克姆说，“因为我难免对他存有偏颇之见。”

伊丽莎白又陷入了沉思遐想之中。过了一会儿，她大声说道：“他怎么能虐待他父亲的教子、朋友和宠儿！”她原本可以加上一句“像你这样的青年，光凭脸蛋就知道是个和蔼可亲的人”，但她实际上说出的话却是：“如你所言，你可是他童年时代的伙伴和形影不离的朋友呀！”

“我们俩出生在同一个教区，同一座庄园里，大半少年时代都是在一起度过的。我们住在同一幢房子里，玩同样的游戏，受到同一个父亲的关怀和照顾。我的生身父亲起先是位律师，干的是你的姨父菲利普斯先生为之作出了重大贡献的营生，可是他为了给达西老先生效犬马之劳，便放弃了自己的前程，全力以赴地料理彭伯里的财产。达西老先生极为器重他，视他为知己和心腹，常夸他办事认真、一丝不苟。我父亲生命垂危之际，达西老先生主动提出要供养我。我觉得，他这样做一方面是为了报答先父的恩德，另一方面是出自对我的一片爱心。”

“真奇怪！”伊丽莎白嚷道，“真可恶！我不明白，这位活着的达西先生既然放不下傲慢的臭架子，怎么又如此地虐待你！如果没有别的原因，而仅仅是因为傲慢，那他就不屑这样阴险——我必须使用这个字眼。”

“是让人感到奇怪，”威克姆说，“他的所作所为差不多全都根源于傲慢，傲慢成了他最亲密的朋友。傲慢促使他比较重视道德观念。可是人总有反复无常的时候，他对我除了傲慢，更多的是感情用事。”

“这种可恶的傲慢给他能带来什么好处呢？”

“对他是有好处的。他常常因此而变得慷慨大方、热情好客，并做些仗义疏财、扶危济贫的善事。他所以这样急公好义，是为了维护家族的体面，为了恪尽孝道——他很为他的父亲的为人感到自豪。他有一个强烈的愿望，那就是光宗耀祖、不负众望，保持彭伯里的影响力。他还有一种做哥哥的自尊，再加上几分手足之情，这就使他成了他妹妹细心、亲切的保护神。常听人夸他是位对妹妹关怀备至的好哥哥。”

“达西小姐是个什么样的姑娘？”

威克姆摇头叹气地说：“我是多么想夸她是位可爱的姑娘呵。凡是评论达西家的人，我都不忍心说个不字。可是她简直太傲慢啦，和她的哥哥一模一样。她小时尚有仁爱之心，是个招人喜欢的小姑娘，对我怀着极深的情意。我花费了大量的时间陪她玩，要是换到现在，我才没那份闲心呢。她今年约十五六岁，模样长得很漂亮，并且琴棋书画样样都会。父亲去世之后，她一直住在伦敦，一位夫人和她住在一起，负责培养她。”

两人断断续续地扯了一大堆闲话，最后，伊丽莎白情不自禁又回到了原来的话题上。只听她说：

“我真感到奇怪，他和宾利先生怎么这样熟！宾利先生脾气温和，待人的确非常厚道，怎么和这号人交上了朋友？他们怎么能合得来呢？你认识宾利先生吗？”

“不认识。”

“他为人和善，性格非常好，是个可爱的人。他可能是不了解达西属于什么样的货色。”

“也许是这样的。不过，达西先生要想和谁交朋友，他有的是办法，最终总能如愿以偿。只要他觉得跟人家攀谈划得来，那他就会口若悬河、谈笑风生。在地位相等的人面前，他是一种样子，而在命运不如他的人面前，他却是另一种样子，简直是判若两人。他总是那么傲慢，但和有钱人在一起时，他又显得胸怀磊落、公正诚实、通情达理、高尚正直，也许还会一团和气——这是因为有钱人的财产和地位起了作用。”

过了没多长时间，玩惠斯特的人便散摊了，都围到了这边的桌子旁。柯林斯先生在伊丽莎白表妹和菲利普斯太太之间选了个位子坐了下来。菲利普斯太太像往常一样，问了一些有关输赢的问题。柯林斯说他的手气不太好，满盘皆输。然而，当菲利普斯太太对他表示同情时，他却板起一副认真的面孔说他一点也没把输的钱放在心上。他说，他把金钱视为身外之物，并请她不必为了他感到难过。

“我很明白，夫人，”他安慰她说，“只要一坐到牌桌旁，这类事情就得靠运气了。幸好我家境宽裕，全然不把五先令当做一回事。自然，能说这种话的人为数是不多的。亏了凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人的扶持，我现在不必计较一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事了。”

他的话引起了威克姆先生的注意。后者把他观察了一会儿，然后低声问伊丽莎白：她的这位亲戚是否和德布尔家很熟。

“凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人最近赐给他一个圣职，”伊丽莎白答道，“虽然不清楚柯林斯先生最初是怎样受到了她的赏识，但我知道他们认识的时间并不长。”

“你想必知道，凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人和安妮·达西夫人是亲姐妹。因此，她就是现在这位达西先生的姨妈。”

“不，我真不知道。对于凯瑟琳夫人家的亲戚，我一无所知。我是在前天才听说有她这么个人的。”

“她的爱女德布尔小姐将来会继承一大笔财产。据说，她和她的表兄将要把两家的产业合二而一。”

听了这话，伊丽莎白不由笑了，因为她想起了可怜巴巴的宾利小姐。假如达西先生已与别的女子许定终身，宾利小姐岂不是白白对他殷勤一番，白白爱怜了一场他的小妹，白白说了那许多赞美他的话。

伊丽莎白继续说：“柯林斯先生对凯瑟琳夫人母女总是赞不绝口，可我怀疑他是让感激之情迷住了心窍。从他所讲的几件事可以听得出，凯瑟琳夫人尽管是他的女恩主，但秉性却高傲自负。”

“她自大得有些不知天高地厚。虽然许多年没见她了，但我记得很清楚，我从来就没喜欢过她，因为她太专横跋扈、目空一切了。她素以智慧超群、聪明过人而著称，不过我倒认为，她的那些才智部分来自显赫的财势，部分来自蛮横霸道，还有一部分来自她外甥的尊严。她的那个外甥总觉得，凡是和他沾亲带故的人，个个都超群绝伦。”

伊丽莎白承认说，他的分析句句都合情合理。两个人你一言我一语谈个不休，彼此都很投机，一直到吃晚饭收牌为止。这时，威克姆先生才把注意力转移到了其他女士那儿。菲利普斯太太的晚宴上总是吵吵闹闹，令人无法交谈，不过威克姆以他文雅的举止博得了众人的青睐。他的每句话都是那样娓娓动听，一举一动都是如此优美大方。伊丽莎白临走时，脑子里只装着他一个人。回家的路上，她一心只想着威克姆，想着他对她说的话。只可惜莉迪亚和柯林斯先生一打开话匣子就收不住嘴，她连提提威克姆名字的机会都没有。莉迪亚把肚子里的话一个劲朝外倒，讲的净是抓彩牌的事，说她输了多少赌注，又赢了多少赌注。柯林斯先生则滔滔不绝地叙说菲利普斯夫妇是怎样对他热情友好，还声称他根本不在乎玩惠斯特时输掉的那几个小钱。接着，他把晚宴的菜肴从头到尾描绘了一遍，描绘时还不时地表明他唯恐马车太窄，会挤坏表妹们。他要说的话真是太多啦，直至马车在浪搏恩府邸的门前停下，还没有把话说完呢。

第十七章


第二天，伊丽莎白把她和威克姆先生之间所说的话都告诉了简。简越听越觉得诧异，越听越感到焦虑。她简直不敢相信，达西先生居然这样不值得宾利先生信赖。可是，像威克姆这样一个和颜悦色的小伙子，她自然不会怀疑他说话不诚实。一想到他可能真的受到了不公平的待遇，她的心里便产生了几分怜悯之情。处在她这样的位置，她只能把两人都朝好处想，为双方的行为进行辩白，将一切无法解释的事情都归结为意外和误会。

她说：“他们俩也许都受了别人的欺骗，具体怎么骗，我们是不得而知的。再者，也许有人在中间挑拨是非。总而言之，我们最好不要硬着头皮去猜测究竟是什么原因、什么事情造成了他们的不和，否则我们势必将伤及一方。”

“说得很对。不过，亲爱的简，对于那些可能做过手脚、破坏了他们关系的人，你会说些什么呢？看来你必须为这些人也开脱一下罪名，不然我们就只好怪罪到某个人的头上了。”

“爱怎么取笑就怎么取笑吧，不过你别想让我改变看法。亲爱的丽莎，好好想想，如果说达西先生虐待一个他父亲异常疼爱，并且答应全力供养的人，就等于给他的头上压了一顶耻辱帽呀。一个人只要具有起码的人道观念，只要还珍重自己的人格，他就做不出这种伤天害理的事。达西先生要是这种人，他最亲密的朋友还看不出来吗？不！这是不可能的。”

“我宁肯相信宾利先生看错了人，也不会怀疑威克姆先生昨晚对我说的是假话，杜撰了一段那样生动的个人历史。一个个人名，一桩桩事实，全都是不假思索、脱口而出。假若事实并非如此，那就让达西先生自己来辩白吧。再说，从威克姆当时的神色看来，不像是有假。”

“这的确是件叫人感到苦恼的棘手事儿。真不知怎么想才好。”

“恕我直言，你知道该怎么考虑这件事。”

其实，简的心里只明白一点——如果宾利先生真的看错了人，一旦真相大白于天下，他定会痛苦万分。

两位年轻小姐在矮树林里谈得正起劲，忽然家中差人来叫她们，说是府上来了客人，而且正是她们刚才讲到的那几个。原来，日盼夜想的尼瑟费德舞会已定于下星期二举行，宾利先生伙同姐姐、妹妹来贝府邀请她们。宾家姐妹和好朋友重逢，感到欣喜万分。她们说几日不见简，便恍恍然有隔世之感，并一再问简自分别以后都做了些什么。她们对贝家的其他人不理不睬：尽量躲着不和贝太太说话，跟伊丽莎白的交谈也仅是片言只语，而对别的人她们连一句话也没说。告辞回府时，她们弹簧似的从座位上一跃而起，那股猛劲儿把她们的兄弟吓了一跳。随后拔腿就走，似乎急于避开贝太太的繁文缛节。

尼瑟费德舞会即将举行的消息，使贝府的太太小姐们乐到了天上。贝太太认为，这次舞会是为了取悦于她的大女儿才举办的。特别叫她感动的是，宾利先生竟然亲自登门邀请，而没有礼节性地差人送张请帖来。简陶醉在遐想之中，想象着她和两位女友在舞会上欢快地畅谈，想象着宾利先生待她温情似水。伊丽莎白也在遐想，可她想的是同威克姆先生欢天喜地跳舞的情景，想象着她将从达西先生的神态举止中印证一切疑点。至于凯瑟琳和莉迪亚，她们可不把开心作乐寄托在一件事或某个人身上，因为虽说她们也和伊丽莎白一样，想跟威克姆先生跳它半个晚上，但威克姆绝不是能够吸引住她们的唯一舞伴。不管怎么说，舞会就是舞会嘛。就连玛丽也向家里人表示，她不妨也去凑个热闹。

她说：“只要好好利用上午的时间，就够啦。晚上偶尔玩玩，也不会造成什么损失。社交活动对我们都有吸引力。我和许多人一样，也认为人人都需要一定的消遣和娱乐。”

伊丽莎白乐得飘然若仙。她平时和柯林斯先生并不多话，而现在却情不自禁地问他是否打算接受宾利先生的邀请。她还问道：假如他有参加舞会的意思，那么他觉得这样做是不是合适呢？出乎她的意料，柯林斯先生在这个问题上毫无顾忌，绝不害怕大主教或凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人指责他，他要勇敢地去跳舞。

他说道：“我认为，这场舞会的东道主是位品行端正的年轻人，而参加者又都是些体面人物，所以不会出现不良倾向。我非常乐意参加舞会，并希望到了那天晚上诸位漂亮的表妹能赏我个脸，陪我跳上几场。伊丽莎白小姐，我想借此机会向你表示，我希望能和你跳头两场舞。我优先选择你，但愿简表妹能归结到正当的理由上，别让她怪我对她不恭不敬。”

伊丽莎白觉得自己被彻底误解了。她原来一心指望着能和威克姆先生跳头两场舞，而现在却叫柯林斯先生纠缠不休！看来，她的热情宣泄的不是时候。事情现已无法挽回，只得把她和威克姆先生的欢乐朝后推一推，尽量照顾柯林斯的面子，接受他的请求了。可是一想到柯林斯的殷勤献媚中还包含着深一层的意思，她的心里就产生了几分不快。她第一次意识到，柯林斯在贝家女子中选中了她，想让她做亨斯福德教士住宅的女主人，而且当罗辛斯庄园没有更合适的宾客时，她可以陪着打打牌。她这个想法很快得到了证实，因为她发现柯林斯对她越来越殷勤，并不住口地夸她聪明活泼。她对自己的魅力所产生的这种影响只感到惊愕，而没有丝毫的喜悦感。事隔不久，母亲便旁敲侧击地告诉她，如果她能同柯林斯缔结良缘，那将是老人家的一大幸事。伊丽莎白权当不理解她的意思，因为她十分清楚：一旦她作出回答，势必会引起一场激烈的口角。再说柯林斯也许永远也不会向她求婚，既然如此，又何必为他而争吵呢。

要不是忙着为参加尼瑟费德舞会做准备，忙着讨论舞会的细节，贝家的几个小女儿说不定有多么可怜呢。因为从接受邀请的那天到舞会召开的那天，雨就淅淅沥沥下个不停，害得她们去不成麦里屯。见不到姨妈，会不成军官，也听不到新闻——连舞鞋上的蝴蝶结也是托人代买的。甚至连伊丽莎白也失去了耐性，怨这鬼天气坏了她的事，使她无法和威克姆先生加深关系。吉蒂和莉迪亚惦念着星期二的舞会，这才勉强熬过了多雨的星期五、星期六、星期日和星期一。





第十八章


伊丽莎白步入尼瑟费德的客厅，用目光在一群穿着红制服的人中间寻找威克姆先生，寻来寻去都没见其踪影，这时候才怀疑到他压根儿没来。上次听到的那些话曾使她有些担忧，但她的信心始终没有动摇过，认为一定能在这儿见到他。来前，她着意打扮了一番，高高兴兴地准备彻底征服威克姆的心，自信有一晚上的工夫准能把他掌握在手中。但转瞬之间，她心里又萌发了一个可怕的念头，怀疑宾利先生在邀请军官时，为了讨好达西，故意漏掉了威克姆。其实，事情并非如此。在莉迪亚迫不及待地询问丹尼先生时，丹尼对着众人讲明了他的朋友缺席的真正原因。他说威克姆前一天进城办事去了，现在还没有回来。随后，他又带着一种意味深长的微笑补充了一句：

“如若不是为了躲避这里的某个先生，我想他绝不会偏偏选这种时候出去办事。”

最后的这句话，莉迪亚倒没有留意，伊丽莎白却记在了心中。她觉得，尽管她起先没有猜对原委，但达西仍是罪魁祸首，应该为威克姆的缺席负责。一种强烈的失望感加深了她对达西的厌恶。所以，当达西走上前彬彬有礼地向她问候时，她的回答显得十分没好气。如果对他有丝毫的好感、宽容和耐心，就是对威克姆的不仁不义。她决定理也不理他，于是悻悻掉头走开了，甚至跟宾利先生说话时也憋着一肚子的火，因为他对达西的盲目偏爱激起了她的愤懑。

不过，伊丽莎白天生是个活泼开朗的人。所以，尽管她的一切美好愿望都已化为泡影，但她胸中的怨气没过多久便烟消云散了。她看到阔别一个星期的夏洛特·卢卡斯，便把满腹的心事一股脑儿倒了出来。接着，她又转了话题，主动向夏洛特公布了柯林斯表兄的古怪行为。说着，她还特意把柯林斯指给夏洛特看。临到跳头两场舞时，她的情绪又低落了下来，觉得那是叫人感到屈辱的时刻。柯林斯舞步笨拙呆板，光知道道歉，却不会留心脚下，常常迈错了步子还不知道，真是个令人厌恶的舞伴，叫伊丽莎白丢尽了脸，受够了洋罪。伊丽莎白一从他的手中解脱出来，便感到欣喜若狂。

接着，她和一名军官跳舞，跟他谈起了威克姆，了解到威克姆是个处处受人爱戴的青年。从舞场上下来后，她又回到夏洛特·卢卡斯的身旁。两人正在闲聊时，她突然听到达西先生叫她，出乎意料地请她跳舞。她一时不知所措，居然糊里糊涂答应了他。等到达西走开之后，她又无端责怪起自己，嫌自己丧失了立场。夏洛特一个劲地安慰着她。

“你一定会发现他非常讨人喜欢。”

“但愿这不是事实！当你决心去痛恨一个人时，却又发现他是个好人，那才是天底下最大的不幸呢！请不要用这种话诅咒我了。”

当跳舞重新开始，达西前来邀请她时，夏洛特禁不住和她咬了咬耳朵，劝她别做傻瓜，别只顾迷恋威克姆，而去得罪一个身价比他高十倍的人。伊丽莎白没有搭腔，径直走下舞池，惊奇地发现自己在这种心情下，居然能和达西先生面对面跳舞。她还发现身边的人们见此情景，也同样露出诧异的表情。她和达西默默无语地跳了一会儿。接着，她便胡思乱想，认为这种沉闷的局面将要持续到两曲舞跳完。起初，她下定决心保持沉默，但后来却突然改变了主意，觉得逼迫舞伴开口讲话，或许可以更有效地惩罚他。于是，她轻描淡写地针对舞蹈发表了几句评论。达西应了一声，随后又闷然无语了。停了没几分钟，伊丽莎白第二次跟他搭话，说道：

“现在轮到你说话啦，达西先生。我既然谈论了舞蹈，你就应该谈谈舞厅的大小和舞伴的多寡。”

达西微微一笑，告诉她说，她要他说什么他就说什么。

“好吧，这种回答眼下也说得过去了。待一会儿，我或许会说私人舞会比公共舞会有趣得多。不过，现在咱们不用再出声啦。”

“你在跳舞时，是不是总要和人聊聊才行？”

“有时候是这样的。人们在一起，总得说上几句话吧。要是一声不吭地在一块待半个钟点，那该多别扭。有些人比较难办，就是不愿开口。在他们面前，必须没话找话说。”

“就目前而言，你是在照顾你自己的情绪，还是在迎合我的心情？”

“兼而有之，”伊丽莎白狡黠地答道，“我总觉得咱们俩的思想极为相似，生性都不好交际，又都是不爱讲话的闷葫芦，除非发表一些语惊四座、流传百世的格言警句。”

“我看这不大像你的性格，”达西说，“倒有几分类似我的性格，至于相似到什么程度我就说不准了。你一定自以为把我刻画得淋漓尽致喽。”

“我当然不能给自己作评语。”

达西没有做声，两人又陷入了沉默。直至他们返回舞池时，达西才问她是否常和姐姐妹妹到麦里屯玩耍。伊丽莎白回答说是这么回事。说到此处，她实在按捺不住，又添加了一句：“那天你在麦里屯碰见我们的时候，我们刚结识了一个新朋友。”

这话立刻产生了效果。达西的脸部顿时重重地罩了一层轻蔑的阴影，不过他什么话也没说。伊丽莎白在心里责怪自己，但是却没有勇气朝下扯。最后，还是达西先开了口，只见他神情窘迫地说：“威克姆先生大方自如，容易交上朋友——至于能否和朋友长久相处，那就不敢担保了。”

“他真够倒霉的，竟然失去了你这样一个朋友，”伊丽莎白一字一板地说，“到头来，他得吃一辈子的苦头。”

达西没有做声，似乎想再换个话题。就在这当儿，威廉·卢卡斯爵士走到他们跟前，打算穿过舞池到大厅的另一端去。可是一见到达西，他便留住了脚步，冲他彬彬有礼地鞠了个躬，随后恭维起他的舞姿和舞伴。

“真叫我大饱眼福呵，亲爱的先生。舞跳得这么棒，实在少见，堪称一流水平呀。不过，你这位漂亮的舞伴也没有让你丢脸。我真希望常有这等眼福，尤其是将来操办什么大喜事的时候，亲爱的伊丽莎白小姐（说着，望了一眼她姐姐和宾利）。在那种良辰吉日，贺喜的人会蜂拥而至。我请求达西先生——算啦，我就不打搅你们啦，先生。你和这位小姐正谈得热火，是不会欢迎我妨碍你们的，瞧小姐那双明亮的眼睛也在责备我呢。”

后边的几句客气话，达西几乎没听进耳里。可是，威廉爵士针对他朋友所说的那番话，却让他吃了一惊。于是，他表情异常严肃地把目光投向正在一起跳舞的宾利和简。过了一会儿，他稳定下情绪，对自己的舞伴说：“威廉爵士半路杀出来，让我忘了咱们刚才谈什么来着。”

“咱们什么也没谈呀。既然无话可说，就不能怪威廉爵士半道干扰了。咱们已扯过两三个话题，但总是不那么投机。真不知下面该谈些什么才好。”

“你看谈谈书怎么样？”达西满脸堆笑地问。

“谈书？不，不行！咱们大概从来不读同样的书，也没有同样的感受。”

“很遗憾，你会这样想。不过，即便如此，咱们也不会无话可说。可以各抒己见，相互切磋嘛。”

“不行——在舞厅里我谈不成书，因为我脑子里总想别的事情。”

“在这种场合，你是不是总想眼前的事情？”达西问，表情里带着一丝狐疑。

“是的，历来如此。”伊丽莎白答道。其实，她心不在焉，不知自己在说什么。片刻之后，她突然莫名其妙地冒出这么一句话：“达西先生，记得有一次你曾说过，你几乎从不宽恕别人，一旦结怨便终生难消。我想，你结怨的时候，一定很谨慎吧？”

“是的。”达西斩钉截铁地说。

“从来不让偏见蒙住你的双眼？”

“我想不会。”

“从不改变观点的人一定要特别注意，一开始就要作出正确的判断。”

“请问，你说这些话用意何在？”

“是针对你的性格说的，”伊丽莎白竭力做出漫不经心的样子说，“我只不过想了解一下你。”

“那你了解得怎么样啦？”

伊丽莎白摇了摇头说：“一点进展都没有。人们众说纷纭，对你的看法莫衷一是，使我无所适从。”

达西不苟言笑地说：“我完全相信人们会对我有截然不同的看法。贝内特小姐，我希望你暂时不要勾画我的性格，因为我有理由担心，那样做对你对我都没有好处。”

“可现在不勾画勾画你，我以后可能就不会再有机会啦。”

“那么我绝不阻挠你发挥兴致。”达西冷冰冰地说。伊丽莎白没有再做声。二人又跳了一曲舞，随后便默然分手了。他们俩都怏怏不乐，不过程度有所不同。因为达西对她怀有强烈的感情，所以很快原谅了她，却把满腔怒火转移到另一个人身上了。

两个舞伴刚分手不久，宾利小姐便朝伊丽莎白走了过来，以既客气却又轻蔑的口吻说道：“伊丽莎小姐，听说那个乔治·威克姆叫你着了迷！你姐姐刚才还跟我谈起他来着，问了我一大堆问题。我发现那个年轻人尽管跟你说这道那，却偏偏忘了告诉你，他的父亲老威克姆曾是已故的达西先生的管家。作为朋友，我想奉劝你一句：不要轻信他的花言巧语。他说达西先生亏待了他，完全是无稽之谈。他以一些不光彩的手段对待达西先生，可达西先生却没有计较，待他仁至义尽。现在，达西先生不愿听人提到乔治·威克姆这个名字，具体是出于什么原因，我不太清楚。不过，我敢肯定，这一点不能怪达西先生。我哥哥这次请军官们来跳舞，本来不好不请威克姆。可后来他自己躲开了，真是皆大欢喜。他实在太不知羞耻了，居然跑到这儿来出丑，我不懂他怎么敢这样做。伊丽莎小姐，我对不起你，揭露了你心上人的短处。不过说真的，就凭他那种出身，你也不能指望他会干出什么好事来。”

“根据你说的话，他的短处就在于他的出身，二者好像混为一谈了。”伊丽莎白生气地说，“我听你说来说去，无非指责他是达西老先生管家的儿子。我可以告诉你，这一点他早就跟我讲过了。”

“请多原谅，”宾利小姐嘴里说着，扭身便走，脸上挂着一丝冷笑，“恕我多言了，不过我全是出自一片好意。”

“厚颜无耻！”伊丽莎白自言自语地说，“还想靠这种卑鄙的人身攻击改变我的看法，那你可是打错了算盘。这倒叫我看透了你的顽固无知以及达西的阴险毒辣。”接着，她返身去找姐姐，因为姐姐答应过要向宾利了解一下这方面的事。这时的简满面春风、喜形于色，充分说明她这一晚上过得有多么得意。伊丽莎白一眼便瞧出了她的心情，于是便把对威克姆的担忧、对威克姆敌人的愤懑以及其他种种烦恼，全都抛到了九霄云外，只是衷心祝愿姐姐能够万事如意，得到自己的那份幸福。

“我想知道，”她像姐姐一样喜笑颜开地说，“你都打听到了威克姆先生的哪些情况。也许你玩得太快活了，根本想不到第三个人。不过即便如此，我也会原谅你的。”

“你错怪了我，”简说，“我并没有忘记他，不过我可没有好消息告诉你。宾利先生并不了解他的全部底细，对于他主要出于什么原因才冒犯了达西先生，更是一无所知。然而，宾利先生愿意为他朋友的崇高品行作担保，说他正直坦率、为人仗义，并深信威克姆先生不值得他那般垂怜和照拂。很遗憾，照宾利先生和他妹妹的话看来，威克姆先生绝不是个正派青年。我想他一定是干了什么非常轻率的事情，才失去了达西先生对他的信任。”

“宾利先生不认识威克姆先生吧？”

“不认识。那天上午在麦里屯，他才算头一回见到他。”

“那么，他只是听了达西先生的一面之词喽。这就对啦。不过，我还想知道宾利先生对那个牧师职位是怎样说的。”

“他虽然听达西先生提过几次，但具体细节却记不清了。不过，他说那个牧师职位传给威克姆先生是附带有条件的。”

伊丽莎白说：“宾利先生为人诚实，这一点无可非议。但是，请你原谅，我不能光凭这几句话就去断定一个人。宾利先生为他的朋友所作的辩解可以说是非常有力的。不过，既然他不了解事情的某些细节，而只偏听偏信他的朋友，那我情愿保留我对那两位先生原来的看法。”

她随即换了一个话题，这个话题不仅两个人都喜欢讨论，而且也不会引起意见分歧。简讲起了宾利先生对她的柔情蜜意，并表达了自己对幸福的热切希望，叫伊丽莎白听了为她感到由衷的高兴。伊丽莎白说了些鼓励的话，增强她的自信心。后来宾利先生走了过来，伊丽莎白便知趣地引退，找卢卡斯小姐去了。卢卡斯小姐询问起她对最后一个舞伴的印象，她还未来得及回答，就见柯林斯跑了过来。柯林斯喜不自禁地声称自己交上了好运，发现了一件非常重要的事情。

他说：“真是无巧不成书，就在这个大厅里，有个人竟是我那女恩主的近亲。我是无意中听他向舞会的女东道主提起了他的表妹德布尔小姐及其母亲凯瑟琳夫人。这种事真是太奇妙了！谁能想到我居然能在这次舞会上遇见凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人的外甥呢！谢天谢地，现在发现还不太晚，还来得及向他问候致安。我这就去找他，相信他会谅解我姗姗去迟的原因。我根本不知道这儿有夫人的亲戚，正所谓不知者不为过嘛。”

“你真的要去向达西先生作自我介绍？”

“当然。我还要请求他原谅我没有及早去问候他。我相信他就是凯瑟琳夫人的外甥。我有责任告诉他，我上星期还见到夫人呢，她老人家硬朗得很。”

伊丽莎白苦口婆心地劝他打消这个念头，说不经人介绍就跑去和达西先生搭腔，达西先生会觉得他唐突冒昧，而不会认为这样做是为了向他的姨妈表示敬意。因此，他们双方丝毫没有必要多礼，即便有必要，也应该由身份较高的达西先生来找他。柯林斯带着一种矢志不渝的神情听她分析情况，非照自己的意图办不可，因而等她一说完，他便回答道：

“亲爱的伊丽莎白小姐，你在自己的知识范围以内对一切问题都有真知灼见，这令我不胜钦仰。不过请恕我直言，俗人的礼仪与教士的礼仪有着天壤之别。我认为，只要行为举止谦恭、得体，就尊严而论，教士的职位比得上王国的君主。所以，这一次你应该允许我按自己的良心行事，去履行我义不容辞的职责。请原谅我不能接受你的指教。要是在别的问题上，我定会把你的教诲奉为座右铭，可唯独在这件事上，我觉得自己受过教育，平素又肯钻研，应该比你这样一位年轻小姐更适合决定怎么做恰当。”

说罢，他深深鞠了个躬，从伊丽莎白身旁跑开，去巴结达西先生了。伊丽莎白留心观察着他们的一举一动，看达西先生会怎样对待表兄的冒失行为。显而易见，达西先生碰到这种事，感到非常惊讶。只见柯林斯先是恭恭敬敬鞠了个躬，然后便开始说起了话。伊丽莎白虽然一句话也听不见，却又觉得好像什么都听到了，从他嘴唇的上下翕动看得出来，他无非说了些“道歉”、“亨斯福德”、“凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人”之类的话。眼看着表兄在这样一个人面前出乖露丑，她心里好不窝火。达西先生以一种毫不掩饰的惊奇目光望着柯林斯，等到他唠叨够了之后，才带着冷漠而不失礼貌的神情敷衍了他几句。但是，柯林斯并没有气馁，还是继续朝下讲。这一次，达西先生听他说话时，鄙夷之情随之剧增。等他最后讲完话，达西先生只是微微欠了欠身子，便扭头走开了。柯林斯这才回到伊丽莎白这儿来。

“告诉你吧，”他说，“受到那样的接待，要是我再不满意，就天理难容了。达西先生见我去拜见他，似乎非常高兴。他十分客气地回答了我的问候，甚至还恭维我说，他极端佩服凯瑟琳夫人的眼力，相信她绝不会无缘无故器重一个人。他的这种看法叫人心服口服。总而言之，我非常喜欢他。”

伊丽莎白再也找不到自己感兴趣的事情了，于是把注意力几乎全部转移到了姐姐和宾利先生身上。她把一幕幕情景看在眼里，心里冒出一连串惬意的念头，变得差不多和简一样快活。她头脑里想象着姐姐住进了这幢房子，小两口耳鬓厮磨、恩爱弥笃。她觉得，假如事情有了这样的结局，她可以做些尝试，去和宾家姐妹搞好关系。她看得分明，母亲的脑子里也在转同样的念头，于是便拿定主意不去接近她，免得听她啰嗦个没完。可是大家坐下来吃饭的时候，母女俩的座位却又偏偏离得不远，叫她觉得倒霉到了极点。更令她气恼的是，母亲跟那个人（卢卡斯太太）信口开河地胡言乱语，而且别的什么都不说，只说她殷切希望简和宾利先生早日完婚。这是个激动人心的话题，贝太太孜孜不倦、津津有味地说个不停，一五一十列举着这桩婚姻的好处。首先，宾利先生是个讨人喜爱的小伙子，非常富有，住的地方和贝府仅隔三英里的路程。其次，宾家两姐妹都非常喜欢简，和她贝太太一样希望能促成这门亲事，想起来真叫人心情舒坦。另外，这件事给她后边的几个女儿也带来了希冀，因为简攀上了这门亲，就可以打开方便之门，使她们接触到富家子弟。最后一点，到了她这把岁数，能把几个没出嫁的女儿托付给她们的姐姐，她自己就不必要过多地陪着应酬了，可以轻轻松松过日子了。按说，遇到这种情况，贝太太应该感到高兴才对，但怎奈她素来喜欢热闹，待在家里便觉得胸憋气闷。末了，她一再祝愿卢卡斯太太也像她一样有福气，但从她那趾高气扬的神态一看就明白，她根本不相信卢卡斯太太会交这等好运。

伊丽莎白试图打断母亲那滔滔不绝的话语，劝她叙述喜悦心情时把声音放小一些，结果是枉费心机。她感到一种难言的痛苦，因为达西先生就坐在桌子对面，据她估计，母亲的谈话八成都让他听了去。母亲却不在乎这些，反而骂她多管闲事。

“达西先生算老几，我才用不着怕他呢。我们又不欠他什么情意，所以不必非得拣些他爱听的话说。”

“看在上帝的分上，说话小声点，妈妈。得罪了达西先生，对您又有什么好处呢？您这样做，他的朋友也会瞧不起您的。”

可是，任凭她怎么说都不起作用，母亲偏要亮开嗓门发表议论。伊丽莎白又羞又恼，脸上红一阵白一阵，由不得向达西先生望来望去，每望一眼便越发证实了自己的焦虑。达西先生虽说没有把目光盯在母亲身上，但她确信，他无时无刻不在留心听母亲说话。达西先生的面部表情是愤怒和鄙夷，慢慢又变得冷静持重、严肃深沉。

最后，还是贝太太自己无话可说了。刚才，卢卡斯太太听着她一遍又一遍地重复一些与卢卡斯太太无干系的喜庆事儿，早就哈欠连篇了，而现在总算清静了下来，可以吃上几口火腿冷肉和烧鸡了。伊丽莎白也松了口气。可好景不长，宁静的局面很快又被打破了。吃完饭后，有人提出想听首歌，而玛丽不经邀请便跃跃欲试，迫不及待想当众出风头，这叫伊丽莎白觉得十分掉价。她频频向玛丽丢眼色，以无声的语言求她不要这样丢人现眼，但玛丽就是不体谅她的心情，认为这是一个展现自己才华的大好时机，于是便乐悠悠唱了起来。伊丽莎白心中痛苦不堪，眼睁睁地盯着妹妹，焦灼不安地听她唱了几段，好不容易等她唱完了，心境却仍然得不到安宁。原来，玛丽在接受同桌的人表示谢意的同时，还听见有人以委婉的口吻请再赏一次脸，于是在歇息了半分钟之后，她又唱起了第二支歌。她嗓门小，表情做作，根本不适合在大庭广众面前亮相。伊丽莎白顿觉苦不堪言。她望了望简，想看简有什么反应，却瞅见她在和宾利先生促膝谈话，表情坦然自若。她又瞧了瞧两个妹妹，看见她们在相互挤眉弄眼。随即，她再望望达西先生，看到他仍旧板着面孔，一脸的严肃相。最后，她把目光投向父亲，求他出面阻拦，免得玛丽唱个通宵。父亲明白了她的意思。等到玛丽把第二支歌唱完，便大声说道：

“这就行啦，我的孩子。你让大伙儿开心得够久了，留点时间给别的小姐表演表演吧。”

玛丽虽然装着什么也没听见，但样子却有些尴尬难堪。伊丽莎白为她感到难过，也为父亲的那席话感到遗憾，觉得自己的一番苦心没有招来好的结果。这时，大伙已在请别的人唱歌了。

“倘若我有幸会唱歌的话，”柯林斯先生说，“我一定非常乐意把自己的歌喉贡献给大家。我认为音乐是一种没有丝毫害处的消遣，和牧师的职业毫不抵触。在这里我并非要大家把过多的时间耗费在音乐上，因为我们毕竟还有其他的事情要做。作为一名教区长，就得日理万机。首先，他必须拟订教会税收条款，既有利于他自己，又不至于冒犯他的恩主。他还得亲自动手，撰写布教词。这样一来剩下的时间就不多啦，而他又要利用这点时间处理教区事务，照管和修缮自己的住宅，因为他没有理由不把住宅收拾得舒舒服服。还有一点我认为也很重要：他应该殷勤和善地对待每一个人，特别是那些提拔他的人。这是他义不容辞的义务。在遇到恩主家的亲戚时，他必须不失时机地表达敬意，否则便是不仁不义。”说罢，他向达西先生鞠了一躬，算是结束了他的即兴讲演。他说话时声若洪钟，半屋子的人都能听得到。人们有的目瞪口呆，有的窃窃私笑，但没有一个人能像贝内特先生那样听得津津有味。他的太太一本正经地夸柯林斯说的话句句在理，还小声对卢卡斯太太说他是个聪明伶俐、和善可亲的好青年。

在伊丽莎白看来，即便她的家人事先约定好要在今晚尽情地出乖露丑，也不会表现得比现在更出色、更成功的了。她觉得宾利和姐姐真是幸运，有些出丑的场面宾利没看见，有些洋相虽然肯定让他瞧了个正着，但他性情宽厚仁达，想必不会动气。不过，他的姐姐妹妹以及达西先生可就得逞了，这下又可以把她的亲属当做笑料啦，真是糟糕透顶。那位先生的无声蔑视和两个娘儿们的无礼冷笑，究竟哪一样更叫人难以忍受，她可不能断定。

在剩下的那段时间里，她失去了一切乐趣。柯林斯先生死缠硬磨地守在她身旁，一个劲地挑逗她。他虽然无法说服她再跟他跳舞，可也闹得她和别人跳不成。伊丽莎白央求他去和别人跳舞，并且愿意为他介绍大厅里的任何一位小姐。柯林斯告诉她说，他对跳舞丝毫不感兴趣，他的主要用意就是悉心侍奉她，以博得她的好感，因此整个晚上都要和她形影不离。他主意已定，和他怎样争辩都无济于事。幸好卢卡斯小姐常到他们这儿来，好心地把和柯林斯交谈的活计都揽到了自己身上，这让伊丽莎白有如释重负之感。

不过起码来说，达西先生没有再来烦扰她，惹她生气。他们俩有时离得非常近，而且达西先生是孤单单一个人，也没见他走过来搭话。她觉得这可能是因为她提到过威克姆先生的缘故，于是心里不由觉得十分庆幸。

舞会结束后，浪搏恩一家人是最后离开的。由于贝太太耍了个手腕，马车迟到了一刻钟。这样，待诸位嘉宾走完之后，他们全家人只得留下来等待。在这段时间里，他们看得出，宾府的有些人十分渴望他们赶快滚蛋。赫斯特太太和她的妹妹几乎懒得说话，只是叫累喊困，显然在下逐客令。贝太太几次想和她们搭腔，都碰了钉子，结果弄得大家无精打采。柯林斯先生虽然发表了一些长篇大论，恭维宾利先生和他的姐妹，说他们的舞会开得高雅别致，还夸他们待客热情友好、礼貌周全，但他的话仍然未能活跃气氛。达西一语不发。贝内特先生也同样默默无声，站在一旁瞧热闹。宾利先生和简离大家稍微远一些，站在一块窃窃私语。伊丽莎白和宾家两姐妹一样，一直寡言少语。就连莉迪亚也累得说不出话来，只是偶尔喊叫一声“天哪，困死我啦！”接着就打上一个大哈欠。

当贝家一行起身告辞时，贝太太十分客气又非常殷切地说，她希望不久能在浪搏恩见到宾利一家人。她还特意告诉宾利先生，她不一定走形式发正式邀请，但希望他能拣个日子到家里去吃顿饭。那将是贝府的莫大荣幸。宾利先生听后，又感激又高兴，说他明天有事要去伦敦几天，等他回来以后，一有机会就去拜望她老人家。

贝太太满意极啦，出了客人的家门，心里打起了如意算盘：大女儿不出三四个月的光景，就可以稳稳当当在尼瑟费德找到归宿了，眼下要做的是准备必要的嫁妆、新马车和结婚礼服。另外，还有一个女儿要嫁给柯林斯先生，对此她同样深信不疑，也觉得相当高兴（尽管不是同样高兴）。在所有的女儿中，她最不喜欢的是伊丽莎白。按说，找到这样一个姑爷，对伊丽莎白来说已经十分不错了。但比起宾利先生和尼瑟费德别墅，柯林斯的条件可就差之千里啦。





第十九章


第二天，浪搏恩发生了一件新鲜事。柯林斯先生正式提出了求婚。他的假期到下个星期六就要结束，再说他当时丝毫也不觉得有什么难为情的，于是便决定抓紧一切时间，表明自己的心迹。付诸行动时，他是那样有板有眼、条理清晰，所有的规矩都没有忘掉，他觉得这是求婚的惯例。用过早餐不久，他看到贝太太、伊丽莎白以及一个小表妹聚在一处，于是便对做妈妈的这样说道：

“夫人，我想请您漂亮的女儿伊丽莎白赏个脸，今天上午跟我单独谈谈，您同意吗？”

伊丽莎白惊讶得涨红了脸，但未等她作出任何反应，便听贝太太回答道：

“啊，好极啦！我同意，当然同意。丽茨一定非常乐意和你私下谈谈，我相信她绝不会有意见的。跟我走，吉蒂，上楼去。”说罢，她收拾好针线活，急匆匆朝楼上走去，不料伊丽莎白大声喊叫了起来：

“好妈妈，别走开。我求求您别走。柯林斯先生必须原谅我。他和我没有什么别人听不成的话要说。不然，我这就走。”

“别走，不要胡来，丽茨。我要你乖乖待在这里。”贝太太见伊丽莎白又恼又窘，的的确确企图一逃了之，于是又强调说，“丽茨，我非要你留下来听柯林斯先生说话不可。”

伊丽莎白不便违抗母命。她略加思忖，觉得如果能尽快地把事情悄悄了结掉，实乃上乘之策。于是，她又坐了下来，并时时刻刻当心着，免得让啼笑皆非的心情溢于言表。贝太太和吉蒂走开了。等她们的身影刚一消失，柯林斯先生便开口说道：

“亲爱的伊丽莎白小姐，请相信我说的话，你害羞这非但没有减少你的魅力，反而使你更加完美了。如果你刚才没有稍许推诿，那么你在我的眼里就会少几分可爱。请允许我顺便告诉你一声，我今天要说的话，全都是经过尊敬的令堂大人许可的。尽管你天性羞怯，但你一定听得明白我这些话的用意。我百般对你献殷勤，目的不言自明，你不会看不到。差不多一踏入贵府的大门，我就挑中了你做我终身的伴侣。关于这个问题，趁现在还能控制得住自己的感情，我或许应该先讲讲我要婚娶的原因，以及我为什么要怀着择偶的目的来哈福德郡。”柯林斯先生泰然自若，表情平静如水，可他却口口声声说自己难以控制感情。伊丽莎白被逗得差点没笑出声，所以在柯林斯话音落地时，她没能采取措施阻止他继续朝下讲。柯林斯稍微停顿了一下，接着又说道：

“我所以要结婚，有如下几条理由：第一，每一位生活富裕的教士（像我自己），我认为都应该在婚姻方面为教区作出榜样；第二，我相信婚姻可以大大促进我的幸福；第三——这一点或许我早就应该提出来——我有幸奉为恩主的那位贵妇人特别劝嘱我要娶妻成家。她老人家曾两次为我出谋划策，而且都是主动的。就在我离开亨斯福德前的那个星期六的晚上，趁着打牌休息的间隙，詹金斯太太为德布尔小姐安放脚凳的时候，她老人家对我说：‘柯林斯先生，你该成个家啦。像你这样的教士，应该娶房太太。对象要选得合适：为了我，选个有教养的女子；为了你自己，就选个能干实惠的女子，出身不求高贵，只求会精打细算，善于过细水长流的日子。这是我的意见。赶快找个这样的女子，把她带到亨斯福德来，让我瞧瞧。’我漂亮的表妹，请允许我顺便指出，凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人的关怀体贴应该算是我的一大优越条件。你将会发现她是那样典雅、温和，简直令人无法形容。我想，你聪明、活泼，定会招她老人家喜欢。如果你对她高贵的身份再能表现出仰慕和尊敬，她会越发喜欢你。以上是我要结婚的主要意图。下面我想谈谈，尽管我们家乡的窈窕淑女比比皆是，可我为什么把目标对准了浪搏恩。原因是这样的：令尊大人过世以后（尽管他老人家还能活许多年），这儿的财产将由我继承，我心里实在过意不去，于是决定娶他的一个女儿为妻。那悲惨的事情一旦发生（我已说过，这得等若干年以后），你们的损失就会减少到最低限度。这就是我的动机，漂亮的表妹。我看你不至于因此而看低我吧。我现在没有别的话要说了，只想用最富于感染力的语言向你倾吐我炽烈的情感。至于财产问题，我一点都不在乎，绝不会向令尊提这方面的要求，因为我很清楚，即使提了他也无法满足。你名下应得的财产，只不过是一笔利息为四厘的一千镑，而且还得待令堂大人过世后才归你所有。因此，对这件事我将绝口不提。请你尽管放心，咱们成婚之后，我绝不会说一句小家子气的话。”

现在非得打断他不可了。

“你未免太性急啦，先生，”伊丽莎白喊叫了起来，“别忘了，我还没有说过一句应允的话哩。没必要浪费时间了，我这就答复你。谢谢你这样看得起我。你的求婚使我深感荣幸，可惜我除了拒绝之外，别无选择。”

“我早就知道，”柯林斯严肃认真地摆了摆手说，“一般来说，年轻小姐初次遇到有人向她们求婚，尽管心里愿意，可口头上却要拒绝，有时甚至会拒绝两三次。由此看来，你的话并没有叫我灰心，我希望不久便可以和你走到神坛前拜堂。”

伊丽莎白高声叫喊道：“我不明白，先生，既然我已表了态，你还不死心，岂非咄咄怪事。实不相瞒，我可不是你所说的那种年轻小姐（如果真有这类人的话），敢于拿自己的幸福作赌注，非等别人第二次开口求婚。我的拒绝可是一点不含糊。你不会给我带来幸福，我也根本不可能使你幸福。你的那个朋友凯瑟琳夫人要是了解我的话，就会发现我无论哪方面都不配做你的太太。”

“凯瑟琳夫人如果真会这么想，”柯林斯严肃地说，“不，不，我想她老人家一定会同意这门亲事。请你放心，待我有幸再见到她时，一定向她夸夸你的贤淑、节俭以及其他种种优点。”

“说真的，柯林斯先生，对我的一切夸奖都是没有必要的。你应该允许我来评判自己的优缺点。务必请你体谅我的苦衷，相信我的话。我祝愿你生活美满、财运亨通。我拒绝你的求婚，就是竭力维持你宁静的日子。你既然已经向我求了婚，也算表达了你对我们家的细腻感情，将来继承浪搏恩财产时也就问心无愧了。所以，这件事就算彻底解决了。”她说着，站了起来。如若不是柯林斯对她说出以下的话来，她就夺门走了出去：

“等我下次再和你谈起这个问题，希望你给我的回答能比这次的令人满意些。目前，我丝毫也不责怪你的冷酷无情，因为我知道你们女人按照惯例总是拒绝男人的第一次求婚。你刚才的那席话很符合女性不显山不露水的含蓄本性，这就足以鼓励我追求下去。”

“听着，柯林斯先生，”伊丽莎白有些生气，大声叫道，“你太让我莫名其妙了。我把话已说得这么明白，你还觉得是在鼓励你，那我真不知怎样拒绝你才能让你死了这条心。”

“请允许我说句心里的话，亲爱的表妹，你的拒绝只是些表面文章。我之所以如此自信，主要有这样几条理由：我认为我的求婚总不至于不值得你接受，我的家产总不至于让你无动于衷；我的社会地位、我与德布尔家族的交情以及我和贵府的关系，都是些对我极为有利的条件。你应该三思而后行，因为你虽然有许多吸引人的地方，但不见得会再有别人向你求婚。你的财产少得可怜，这就很可能抵消掉你的可爱和你的善良之处。因此，我断定你并非真心拒绝我的求婚。我认为，你这是故弄玄虚，无非是想促使我的爱情升华，采用的完全是典雅女性惯用的手法。”

“我向你保证，先生，我绝不是故弄玄虚，有意捉弄一个堂堂的绅士。真希望你能相信我的话，认为我是严肃认真的。承蒙不弃，向我提出求婚，实在叫我感激不尽，但要我接受，却是绝对办不到的。我的感情无论如何都不允许我这样做。我的话难道还不够明白吗？请你不要把我当做一位存心捉弄你的典雅女性，而将我看为一个说真心话的理智人物。”

“你始终都是那么可爱！”柯林斯高声说道，神情虽然尴尬，却又十分殷勤，“我相信，只要令尊令堂做主应承了我，我的求婚就会落到实处。”

伊丽莎白不屑于再答理这样一个泥古不化、自欺欺人的求婚者，连忙悄悄走了出去。她打定了主意：假若他执意要把她的一再拒绝视为怂恿和鼓励，那她就去向父亲求援。由父亲出面斩钉截铁地把他顶回去，总不至于被误解为一个典雅女性在故弄玄虚、卖弄风情吧。





第二十章


屋里只剩下了柯林斯一人，于是他开始默默地憧憬起婚姻的幸福美景，但没过多久便有人进来打断了他的胡思乱想。原来，贝太太一直在前厅徘徊，等着听两位年轻人谈话的结果。后来一见伊丽莎白打开房门，急匆匆向楼梯口走去，她便马上溜进了饭厅，祝贺起柯林斯，也祝贺了她自己，恭喜他们就要亲上加亲了。柯林斯接受了她的贺词，也以同样喜悦的心情祝贺了她，然后一五一十把他和伊丽莎白交谈的情况汇报了一遍。他对谈话的结果非常满意，认为表妹虽然一口拒绝了他，但那是表妹害羞和娇柔含蓄性格的自然流露。

这种情况倒让贝太太吓了一大跳。假如女儿真的是表面拒绝他的求婚，心里却在鼓励他，那她也会和柯林斯一样觉得称心如意，可是她不敢这么想，而且嘴上由不得把她的顾虑说了出来。

“不过，请你放心，柯林斯先生，”她最后又补充道，“我立刻亲自出马找丽莎谈谈，一定会让她明白过来。她是个非常任性的傻姑娘，不懂得好歹，不过我会让她懂得的。”

“请原谅我插句嘴，夫人，”柯林斯叫嚷道，“如果她果真又任性又愚蠢，那我就不知道她是否能成为我称心如意的太太，因为像我这种地位的人，结婚自然是为了寻求幸福。她要是实在不愿意接受我的求婚，还是不勉强为好。她在性格上有这些瑕点，就不可能给我带来什么幸福。”

“你完全误解了我的意思，先生，”贝太太惊恐万状地说，“丽茨只是在这类事情上任性，而在其他方面她的脾气可好啦。我这就去找贝内特先生，我们很快就能使她回心转意。”

她不等对方回答，便急火火去找丈夫，一进书房就扯开嗓门喊了起来：

“老天呀！贝内特先生，你快出来一下，家里都闹翻天啦。你得劝劝丽茨，让她嫁给柯林斯先生。那死丫头口出狂言，说绝不和他结婚。你要是不抓紧，柯林斯先生可就要改变主意，不再考虑她了。”

等她走上前来，贝先生把目光从书本上移开，抬起头，冷静、漠然地望着她，一点也没有为她的话感到惊慌。

“我不知道你在说些什么。”贝先生等她把话啰嗦完，这才说道。

“我说的是柯林斯先生和丽茨嫁给柯林斯的事情。丽茨扬言说绝不嫁给柯林斯先生，而现在柯林斯先生也一改初衷，说不娶丽茨了。”

“我又有什么办法呢？看来这事是没指望啦。”

“你找丽茨谈谈，就说你非要她嫁给柯林斯先生不可。”

“那就叫她下来，让她听听我的意见。”

贝太太摇了摇铃，差人去把伊丽莎白小姐请到书房来。

“到这儿来，孩子，”伊丽莎白一露面，她父亲便喊叫了起来，“我唤你来，是想和你谈件重要的事情。听说柯林斯先生向你求婚啦。此事当真？”伊丽莎白回答说是真的。“很好——这门亲事被你一口拒绝啦？”

“是的，爸爸。”

“很好。咱们还是言归正传吧。你妈妈非要你接受他的求婚不可。我说得对吗，贝内特太太？”

“对。她要是不答应，我宁肯再也不见她的面。”

“伊丽莎白，你面临着一个不幸的抉择。从今天起，你必须和你的父母当中的一个分道扬镳。如果你不嫁给柯林斯先生，你的母亲今生今世都不愿见你，但如果你嫁了柯林斯先生，我就永远不再见你。”

事情如此开场，又出现了这么个结局，使伊丽莎白哑然失笑。贝太太原以为丈夫会按她的意愿处理女儿的婚事，现在却大失所望。

“你这样说话是什么意思，贝内特先生？你可是答应过我，非让丽茨嫁给柯林斯先生不可呀。”

“亲爱的，”她的丈夫回答道，“我有两个小小的要求。第一，请允许我独立的对这件事作出判断；第二，请不要来我的房间里干扰我。如果你能立即走出书房，我将不胜感激。”

贝太太虽然在丈夫那儿碰了一鼻子灰，但她并不善罢甘休，反复找伊丽莎白谈了许多次，把哄骗和威胁的招儿都使尽了。她想拉简为她帮腔，可是简天生不喜多事，委婉地回绝了她的请求。面对母亲的胡搅蛮缠，伊丽莎白应答自如，时而恳切认真，时而嬉皮笑脸。她采取的方式千变万化，但决心却始终如一。

此刻，柯林斯躲在无人处仔细回味着刚刚发生的事情。他把自己看得太高，实在不理解他的表妹为什么要拒绝他。他的自尊心受到了伤害，除此之外，他并不感到难过，因为他对伊丽莎白的感情都是虚无缥缈的。一想到伊丽莎白会受到母亲的责骂，他的懊丧心情便飞到爪哇国去了。

正当贝府乱成了一锅粥时，夏洛特·卢卡斯却跑来串门了。莉迪亚飞步上前，在前厅迎住她，冲她低声嚷道：“你来得太好啦，快来瞧热闹吧！你猜今天早晨发生了什么事？——柯林斯先生向丽茨求婚，被丽茨拒绝啦。”

夏洛特未来得及张口说话，吉蒂也跑了过来，讲的是同一件事。几个姑娘一起走进餐厅，发现贝太太独自一人待在那里生闷气。贝太太见到卢卡斯小姐，又提起了伊丽莎白的婚事，企图唤起同情，并求她劝导伊丽莎白顺从全家人的心愿。“亲爱的卢卡斯小姐呀，”她以一种凄凄哀哀的语调说，“没有人站在我的一边，没有人为我说话，都对我残酷无情，谁也不可怜可怜我脆弱的神经。”

这时，简和伊丽莎白碰巧走进来，算是给夏洛特解了围。

“哼，她来啦，”贝太太继续说道，“瞧她那满不在乎、旁若无人的样子，只知道一意孤行，就好像我们都不存在似的——不过我得把话说明白，丽茨小姐……如果你养上坏毛病，一遇到有人求婚就拒绝，那你一辈子休想找到丈夫。真不知你的父亲死后，谁还会供你茶饭。我警告你，别指望靠我养活。从今天起，我就和你一刀两断了。我在书房发过誓，说绝不再答理你，对此我言出必行。我懒得和忤逆不孝的孩子说话……其实，我和谁也懒得说话。像我这种神经脆弱的人，没有多大兴致与人交谈。谁也不知道我受的罪有多大！不过，世界上的事历来如此——你不诉诉苦，就没有人可怜你。”

女儿们肃立一旁，一声不响听着她发牢骚。她们既没有同她理论，也没有劝慰她，因为她们知道那只会火上加油，叫她越加愤怒。贝太太不停点地朝下讲，没有一个人出来打断她。后来，柯林斯先生走了进来，神情比往常更加庄严肃穆。贝太太这才打住了话头，对姑娘们说道：“你们现在都给我闭上口，让我和柯林斯先生谈一会儿话。”

伊丽莎白静悄悄地走了出去，简和吉蒂紧随其后。只有莉迪亚赖住不动，定要听听他们都说些什么。夏洛特先是被柯林斯的客套话缠住了身，没有能走成。柯林斯询问起她以及她家里人的情况，而且问得非常详细。后来，她感到一阵好奇，于是便走到窗户跟前，装着不在意的样子，却竖起耳朵听了起来。贝太太以一种悲哀的声音，开始了注定要进行的谈话：“哎！柯林斯先生！”

“亲爱的夫人，”柯林斯说道，“这件事咱们永远都不要再提啦。我绝不会……”他停顿了一下，随后又说了下去，声音闷闷不乐，“……我不会对令嫒的行为耿耿于怀。碰到无法幸免的灾难，我们大家都应该逆来顺受。像我这样洪福齐天，年纪轻轻便受到器重的青年更应该如此。我相信我一切都听天由命。即使我的漂亮表妹垂怜于我，接受了我的求婚，我也难免要怀疑自己是否能真正得到幸福，因为我经常这样想：幸福一经拒绝，在我们的心目中就会贬值。这时，听天由命就成了我们的良策妙计。亲爱的夫人，我没有请您老以及贝先生出面为我做主，便收回了对令嫒的求婚，希望您不要认为这是对贵府的不敬。我这样做也许有些欠考虑，因为我没有从您口中听到拒绝的话，而只是偏听了令嫒单方面的意见。可是，人人都有出错的时候。在这件事上，我始终都是出于一片好心。我的目的是确定一个合意的伴侣，同时还兼顾贵府的利益。假如我在做法上有不当之处，在此我向您表示歉意。”





第二十一章


人们对柯林斯先生求婚一事的议论，现在已临近尾声。对于这件事，伊丽莎白只感到有些不自在，而她的母亲也仅仅是偶尔指桑骂槐地对她说上几句气话。至于那位先生本人，他并没有露出尴尬或沮丧的表情，见了伊丽莎白也没有躲避的意思，然而却老是板着脸，气呼呼地一声不吭。他几乎再没有跟伊丽莎白说过话，到了后半天就把他曾经引以为自豪的柔情蜜意转移到了卢卡斯小姐身上。卢卡斯小姐听他说话时，显得非常有礼貌，叫大伙儿都松了口气，尤其是她的朋友伊丽莎白。

贝太太到了第二天，情绪仍然非常低落，神经痛的毛病也没有恢复。柯林斯先生还是那副又气愤又高傲的样子。伊丽莎白以为他既然生了闷气，就会尽快离开贝府，但是他做客的计划似乎并没有因此而受到影响。他原打算待到星期六，现在仍然要等到那一天才肯回家。

吃过早饭，小姐们安步当车，走到麦里屯询问威克姆先生是否已回来，准备见到他后当面对他未能参加尼瑟费德的舞会表示惋惜。说来也巧，她们一到镇上就碰上了威克姆先生。威克姆陪着她们走到姨妈家，向她们抒发了他的遗憾和烦恼，还表达了他对大伙儿的思念之情。不过，他私下向伊丽莎白主动承认说，他完全是有意识没去参加尼瑟费德的舞会。

“当舞会临近时，”他说，“我突然觉得还是不见达西先生为好。跟他在同一间屋子、同一个舞会上待上好几个小时，那会叫我受不了。万一争吵起来，反而会扫了大家的雅兴。”

伊丽莎白十分赞赏他的克制态度。后来，威克姆伙同另外一位军官送她们姐妹几个回浪搏恩。一路上威克姆总是陪伊丽莎白说话。他们从从容容谈起了舞会的情况，而且还客客气气彼此把对方夸奖了一通。威克姆送他们回家有两点好处：一来让伊丽莎白觉得这是在向她献殷勤；二来他可以趁机结识一下她的父母双亲。

刚一入家门，简就收到了尼瑟费德方面的一封来信。她立刻把信拆开，看到里面装着一张小巧精致、平平展展的信笺，字迹清新娟秀，显然是出自一个女人的手笔。伊丽莎白发现她读着读着就变了脸色，还发现她在读其中的几段话时揣摩了老半天。简很快就稳定了情绪，将信抛到一旁，又和平时一样高高兴兴和大家聊起了天。可是，伊丽莎白却非常为她担忧，所以和威克姆说话时也不能够专心了。威克姆与他的伙伴一走，简便向伊丽莎白丢了个眼色，请她一道上楼去。进了她们自己的闺房，简掏出那封信说：

“这是卡罗琳·宾利写来的，上面的话叫我大吃一惊。他们全家现已离开尼瑟费德，奔城里去了，而且再也不打算回来了。你听听她是怎么说的。”

随即，她念出了第一句话，其大意如下：她们姐妹俩决定随宾利先生马上进城，打算当天赶到格罗斯维诺街赴宴（赫斯特先生在这条街上拥有一幢房屋）。信的下文是这样写的：“最亲爱的朋友，告别哈福德郡，除了见不到你以外，我别无其他遗憾。希望将来咱们还能像过去那样愉快地交往，同时，希望咱们能经常通信，多谈谈心里话，减轻离别的痛苦。再见。”听到这些华丽浮夸的词句，伊丽莎白无动于衷，又觉得狐疑满腹。她对宾家人的不辞而别只是感到诧异，并不觉得有什么惋惜的地方。她认为，那姐妹俩不打算再回尼瑟费德来，并不一定就意味着宾利先生也不打算回来。简虽然见不到宾家姐妹，但有宾利先生陪伴她，也就无所谓了。

“真可惜，你的朋友走前没能和你见上一面，”停了一会儿，伊丽莎白说道，“不过，既然宾利小姐认为将来还有重逢的欢乐，难道我们不能希望这一天比她预料的可以来得更早一些吗？你们将来做了姑嫂，岂不比今天做朋友来得更快乐吗？宾利先生在伦敦不会任她们摆布，长久待下去的。”

“卡罗琳在信上写得很清楚，说他们家今年冬天谁也不回哈福德郡来。让我念给你听听。”

“昨天和我们辞别时，哥哥还以为这次到伦敦去，三四天就能把事情办妥。可是我们认为这不可能，同时我们相信，查尔斯一进了城，绝不肯马上就走。因此，我们决定尾随而去，免得他冷清一人住在旅馆里受罪。我的许多朋友都到那儿过冬去了。最亲爱的朋友，我真希望你也到城里去——不过，对此我不抱任何指望。我诚恳地祝愿你能像往常一样，在哈福德郡过一个愉快的圣诞节，祝愿你交上一大批男朋友，省得我们三个一走，叫你感到难过。”

“信上提得很明白，今年冬天宾利先生不打算回来。”简补充道。

“这不过说明宾利小姐不想让他回来罢了。”

“你为什么这样想？那一定是他自己的主意，因为他的事情需他自己决定。你听到的还只是部分情况呢，下边我来读读尤为令我伤心的片段。我对你什么事情都不隐瞒。”

“达西先生迫不及待地想去看望他的妹妹，说句老实话，我们也同样殷切地希望和她重逢。我觉得，乔治亚娜·达西天姿国色、举止典雅，再加之多才多艺，真可谓天下无双的奇女子。我和路易莎都很喜欢她，都希望她有朝一日能嫁入我们家，这样，我们对她的兴趣便更加浓厚了。不知以前我是否向你谈过我对此事的态度。我就要离开此地了，走前得把心里的话倒一倒。我相信，你绝不会认为我的观点不合情理。我哥哥深深爱慕着达西小姐，现在又有了频繁接触的机会。他们自然会亲密起来。双方的亲属都希望能缔结这桩姻缘。我觉得查尔斯最能博得女人的欢心，你们可不要以为我这个做妹妹的因偏心眼才这么说。所有的因素都在朝有利的一面发展，中间连一点阻力也没有。亲爱的简，我衷心希望他们满足众人的心愿，结下百年之好，难道这也有错吗？”

“你对这段话有何感想，亲爱的丽茨？”简念完后，问道，“这还不够清楚吗？这不是明明在表示，卡罗琳既不希望，也不愿意让我做她的嫂子吗？她确信她的哥哥对我是无所谓的。要是她怀疑我对她的哥哥情深意笃，那她岂不是在劝我格外当心吗？——真谢谢她的好心好意！——这些话还能有别的解释吗？”

“有啊。我的解释就与你的截然两样。愿意听听吗？”

“非常愿意。”

“其中的道理只消三言两语就能说明白。宾利小姐一定是看到她哥哥爱上了你，却企图让他娶达西小姐做太太。她随他进城，就是想把他拦在那里，而且竭力想让你相信她的哥哥并不爱你。”

简摇了摇头。

“真的，简，你应该相信我的话。凡是见过你和宾利先生在一起的人，都不会怀疑他对你的爱慕之心。宾利小姐又不是白痴，怎能看不明白？达西先生对她哪怕只有一半这样的爱心，她也就会张罗着做结婚礼服了。问题的症结在于：咱们家无钱又无势，和他们门户不当。她急着让自己的哥哥娶达西小姐，是别有用心的。她认为，两家只要有了第一次联姻，第二次联姻就不会有多大问题。这个计谋还真有些独出心裁，要不是德布尔小姐在中间插一杠子，说不定还会得逞呢。亲爱的简，你可千万不能上当受骗，仅仅因为宾利小姐说她的哥哥深爱着达西小姐，你就当真认为宾利先生自星期二离开你后便轻淡了对你的感情——哪怕是一丝一毫的轻淡。你别以为她有本事让她的哥哥舍弃对你的爱，而去钟情于她的那位朋友。”

“如果咱们俩对宾利小姐的看法一致，”简答道，“你的这种分析或许能叫我觉得心安理得。但我知道，你的根据是不公正的。卡罗琳绝不会存心骗人，现在我只希望她是在这件事上想岔了道。”

“这就对喽。既然我的分析叫你的心灵不安，那你就把事情往好处想喽。什么话都不必说了，你就权当她是转错了念头吧。你现在对她已尽到了责任，不要再心烦了。”

“然而，亲爱的妹妹，即便朝最好处着想，我最终嫁给了宾利先生，而他的姐妹及朋友却希望他和别人结婚，那样我能幸福吗？”

“主意得由你自己拿，”伊丽莎白说，“倘若经过深思熟虑之后，你觉得得罪他的姐姐和妹妹所招致的痛苦，比起做他的太太所得来的幸福还要大，那我就劝你干脆同他各自东西。”

“你怎么能这么说话？”简淡然一笑说，“你要知道，虽然我对她们的蛮横干涉感到十分伤心，但我绝不会改变主意的。”

“我想你也不会的。既然如此，我就用不着为你的处境牵肠挂肚了。”

“不过，他要是今年冬天不回来，我可就没有希望了。在六个月的时间里，什么事情都可能发生！”

要说宾利先生不再回来，这种想法只能让伊丽莎白嗤之以鼻。她觉得那仅仅是卡罗琳个人的愿望。这种愿望无论表达得多么露骨，或者多么委婉，她认为对一个完全不受他人摆布的青年来说，都不会产生作用。

她条理清晰地把自己对这个问题的看法讲给姐姐听，很快就收到了良好的效果，这让她打心眼里高兴。简平素很少有垂头丧气的时候，此刻经妹妹一劝一说，便逐渐萌发了希望。尽管她的希望里有时会掺进疑虑，但她还是相信宾利准会回到尼瑟费德来，一桩桩地了却她的心愿。

姐妹俩商量好，决定只把宾利一家离开乡下的消息告诉贝太太，而绝口不提宾利先生所处的境地，省得叫她惊慌失措。谁知，就连这么一点点信息也让她老人家伤了好一阵子神。她唉声叹气地怨自己命运不好，那两位女士刚和她厮混熟就走了。不过，伤心了一阵之后，她欣慰地想到，宾利先生不久就可以返回，到浪搏恩来吃饭。最后，她心平气和地向女儿们宣布：虽然请他来吃的是顿便餐，但她准备下工夫准备两道大菜。





第二十二章


贝内特合家被请到卢卡斯府上吃饭。卢卡斯小姐真是个慈悲心肠，舍出大半天的时间听柯林斯唠叨。伊丽莎白寻了个机会向她致谢。“这样可以让他的精神快活些，”她说，“对此我感恩不尽。”夏洛特对自己的朋友说，她很乐意效劳，虽然耗费了点时间，却得到了极大的快慰。据此看来，她真够体贴人的，不过她的好意已经超出了伊丽莎白的想象。原来，她有意逗引柯林斯跟她说话，免得他再去向伊丽莎白献殷勤。这个计谋看来进展得相当顺利。晚上分手的时候，她觉得把握性很大，要不是柯林斯这么快就要离开哈福德郡，她简直可以稳操胜券了。但她这样想，未免低估了柯林斯雷厉风行、独往独来的性格。第二天早晨，柯林斯使了个金蝉脱壳计溜出浪搏恩府邸，窜到卢家，去向卢小姐屈身求爱。他提心吊胆地就怕让表妹们瞧见，心想她们若是发现了他的行踪，就会猜出他的意图。在成功缺乏把握性之前，他不愿让自己的意图过早地暴露。虽说夏洛特对他情意绵绵，使他觉得事情有了八九分希望，但一想到星期三那天在伊丽莎白面前碰的钉子，他就有些余悸未消。不过，到了卢家，他受到了最富于人情味的接待。卢卡斯小姐打楼上的窗口望见他走过来，急忙跑到胡同里迎接，装出一副偶然相逢的样子。她万万没想到，柯林斯先生当下就一句接一句地向她倾诉起自己的爱慕之心。

柯林斯发表了一连串的长篇大论，而他们利用其中短暂的间歇时间谈妥了一切，并且做到了使双方都满意。一进卢府，柯林斯郑重其事地请求小姐选择黄道吉日，好使他成为最幸福的男人。对于这种仓促的求婚，按说应该暂不予答复，可小姐实在不忍心置他的幸福于不顾。柯林斯生性蠢笨，求爱时没有一点吸引力，所以总是碰壁。卢卡斯小姐接受他的求婚，纯粹是图将来有个归宿，早一天晚一天她倒不在乎。

接着，他们立即去见威廉爵士和卢卡斯太太，征求他们的同意。两位老人喜滋滋地一口就答应了下来。他们的这个女儿得不到什么财产，从柯林斯目前的境况看来，这门亲事对她真是再合适不过啦。何况柯林斯的前景很乐观，将来还能招财进宝。卢卡斯太太带着前所未有的兴致，即刻盘算起贝内特先生还能活多少年。威廉爵士断然地说，柯林斯先生只要把浪搏恩的财产拿到手里，他们两口就大有希望觐见国王了。总而言之，全家人都从不同的角度为这事感到高兴。几个小女儿都满怀希望，认为这样一来她们就可以提前一两年进入社交场了，而男孩子们再也不用担心夏洛特会当一辈子老处女了。只有夏洛特本人倒相当镇定。现在大功已告成，她得冷静下来作一番思考了。她想来想去，大体上还比较满意。确切地说，柯林斯既不通情达理，又不讨人喜欢，和他在一起生活实在令人厌倦，就连他对她的爱也一定是空中楼阁、镜花水月。不过，她总算要有个丈夫了。她并不看重男人和婚姻，但嫁人却是她的一贯目标。对于受过良好教育但却没有多少财产的年轻小姐，嫁入是唯一的一条体面的出路。有了丈夫，不一定能得到幸福，但总算进了生活的保险箱。卢卡斯小姐其貌不扬，但在二十七岁的时候，搞到了一只这样的保险箱。她觉得自己交上了好运。这件事最不开心之处，就是伊丽莎白·贝内特闻讯后一定会大吃一惊，而她又最为珍惜她和伊丽莎白的友情。伊丽莎白会感到纳闷，说不定还会谴责她。这样的谴责动摇不了她的决心，但却可以叫她感到难过。她决定亲口把此事告诉给伊丽莎白，因而叮咛柯林斯回浪搏恩吃饭时，不要漏出风声去。柯林斯当然是唯命是从，答应为她保守秘密，但真正做起来就不那么容易了。他离家的时间太久，引起了众人的普遍关注。他一进门，其他人就七嘴八舌地问了他些直截了当的问题。要绕过这样的提问，的确得费些心机。再说，他当时也是在拼命克制自己，因为他真想把自己在情场上所取得的战绩宣扬宣扬。

第二天一大清早他就要登路启程了，来不及和家里人话别，于是他的辞行仪式就改到了晚上女士们入寝前进行。贝太太极其诚恳、极其礼貌地说，以后他要是得便，她们将热切地希望他再来浪搏恩做客。

“亲爱的夫人，”柯林斯答道，“承蒙邀请，我不胜感激。其实，我早就知道您会对我这么热情。务必请您放心，我一有空，就来向您问安。”

众人一听，惊得目瞪口呆。贝内特先生害怕的就是这一点，于是急忙说道：

“你就不怕凯瑟琳夫人不同意吗，我的贤侄？最好把亲戚关系看淡些，免得让夫人怪罪。”

“亲爱的先生，”柯林斯回答说，“非常感谢您的好意提醒。不过请您放心，这么重大的事情，不经夫人的恩准，我是不会轻举妄动的。”

“多小心一些只会有好处。冒什么样的险都不当紧，就是别惹她老人家不高兴。如果你觉得再到这儿来会让夫人生气——我认为这是极有可能的——那你就本本分分待在家里。请你放心，我们绝不会因此而见怪的。”

“亲爱的先生，承蒙您关心爱护我，真叫我感激不尽。请您相信我的话，我很快就会给您发来一封感谢信，感谢您的谆谆教诲，也感谢我在哈福德郡做客期间您对我的种种照拂。至于诸位漂亮的表妹，虽然我不久就会回来，用不着如此客气，但我还是要祝愿她们身体健康、生活幸福，这里边也包括伊丽莎白表妹。”

太太和小姐们客套了一通，说了些得体的话，然后便告辞各自回房了。她们都没有料想到，柯林斯竟然在考虑短期内重访贝府。贝太太胡思乱想起来，以为他企图向她的哪个小女儿求婚。如果是这样，她就应该给玛丽做做工作，劝她接受这门亲事。这个孩子比她的哪个姐妹都看重他的才能。她常常被柯林斯深邃、稳重的思想所打动。据她看来，柯林斯虽然不像她一样才华横溢，但如果能以她为榜样刻苦攻读、不断进取，就一定能成为一个称心如意的伴侣。只可惜到了第二天早上，诸如此类的希望便化成了泡影。早饭时间刚过，卢卡斯小姐叩门造访，和伊丽莎白私下谈了一场，和盘端出了头一天所发生的事情。

早在前一两天，伊丽莎白就曾想到过，柯林斯很可能一厢情愿地爱上了她的女友。她当时以为，夏洛特和她一样，绝不会怂恿鼓励柯林斯的这种感情。所以，当听了夏洛特的陈述后，她不禁大吃一惊，竟然不顾礼貌地失声喊道：“你跟柯林斯先生订婚啦！亲爱的夏洛特，这简直是天方夜谭！”

卢卡斯小姐刚才介绍自己的罗曼史时，神情镇定自若，而现在听了这么一句直言不讳的批评话，便显得有些慌张。不过，这也是她预料之中的结局，所以她即刻恢复了平静，从容不迫地说：

“这有什么大惊小怪的，亲爱的伊丽莎？就因为柯林斯先生没福气博得你的爱怜，你就觉得他不可能被别的女人看上眼？”

幸好这时伊丽莎白已稳定住了情绪。她努力克制住自己，用非常坚定的口气告诉女友，说这是一桩美满的姻缘，并预祝她幸福如意。

“我知道你心里在想什么，”夏洛特说，“你一定觉得奇怪，非常非常的奇怪——因为不久前柯林斯先生想娶的还是你。但你要是平心静气地好好想一想，就能理解我的所作所为了。我不是一个浪漫主义者，这你是知道的。我渴望得到的只是一个舒适的家。就柯林斯先生的性格、人际关系和社会地位而言，我相信我和他在一起能够得到幸福，可能性之大，不会亚于多数结婚的女子。”

伊丽莎白这次不动声色地说：“那当然。”

两个人别别扭扭、沉默寡言地在一起又坐了一会儿，随后便回到了家人中间。夏洛特没多久就走了。把她送走后，伊丽莎白开始苦苦思索刚刚听到的话。对于这样一门不般配的亲事，她的思想久久转不过弯来。柯林斯先生三天之内求了两次婚，这本来已是奇闻怪事，而现在竟有人答应了他，就更叫人称奇了。她一直觉得夏洛特和她的婚姻观有所不同，可她万万想不到，一旦事到临头，夏洛特竟会舍弃感情方面的因素，一味地去追求世俗的利益。哼，夏洛特当柯林斯的太太，这真是奇耻大辱！她为朋友的寡廉鲜耻感到痛心，并因此而瞧不起她。除此之外，她的心里还产生了一种忧伤感，觉得夏洛特选择的这桩婚姻不会给她带来多大的幸福。





第二十三章


伊丽莎白和母亲及姐妹在一块闲坐时，仍在为刚听到的那件事苦思冥想。她心里拿不定主意，不知该不该把此事告诉家里人。正在这当儿，威廉·卢卡斯大驾光临了。他受女儿的差遣，来向贝府的人公布女儿订婚的消息。他一边把情况慢慢道来，一边满口恭维太太和小姐们，还说两大家族的联姻是件可喜可贺的事情。贝太太和女儿们听后，不仅感到愕然，还不肯相信呢。贝太太再也顾不上什么礼节了，一口咬定他阴差阳错把事情搞颠倒了。莉迪亚平时就出言不逊，撒野撒惯了，这时只听她咋咋呼呼地嚷道：

“老天呀！好你个威廉爵士，怎么能编出这段故事？你难道不知道，柯林斯先生想娶的是丽茨吗？”

受到这样的虐待，就是惯于逆来顺受的蔫巴人也会火冒三丈的。幸亏威廉爵士的涵养好，没有发作起来。他一边忍气吞声地听着向他劈头盖脸泼来的脏话，一边可怜巴巴地请求大家相信他说的都是实话。

伊丽莎白觉得她有责任替威廉爵士解围，于是便挺身而出为他作证，并声称自己在这以前已经从夏洛特那儿听说了此事。她不愿再听母亲和妹妹胡搅蛮缠，便态度诚恳地向威廉爵士表示祝贺。简也跟着说了些道喜的话。接下来，伊丽莎白一五一十列举了这桩婚姻的幸福前景和柯林斯先生出众的人品，还指出亨斯福德距伦敦近在咫尺，来去非常方便。

贝太太实在给气糊涂了，当着威廉爵士的面没说多少话。可是威廉爵士一走，她的满腔愤懑顿时发泄了出来。第一，她坚绝不相信这件事；第二，她断定柯林斯先生上了别人的当；第三，她认为柯林斯和夏洛特在一起永远也得不到幸福；第四，她说这门亲事很可能告吹。她从整个事件中得出了两个明显的结论：其一，伊丽莎白是这场恶作剧的真正祸根；其二，她本人被粗暴野蛮地耍弄了。后半天的时间，她主要围绕着这两点发牢骚。任别人怎么说也安慰不了她的心、平息不了她的怒火。整整一天过去了，她的怨恨仍未消除。她见到伊丽莎白就骂，一直骂了一个星期；足足有一个月的时间，她和威廉爵士夫妇一搭话就没好气；好几个月过去之后，她才逐渐地原谅了他们的女儿卢卡斯小姐。

在这件事上，贝内特先生的态度就要平静得多了。据他自己声称，此事的发生令他感到快慰至极。他说，他以前老是觉得夏洛特·卢卡斯是个明白人，哪里知道她居然和他的太太一样蠢，比不上他的女儿有心计，实在叫人感到高兴！

简对这门亲事也感到有些意外，但她极少表露内心的惊讶，只是一个劲诚恳地说些贺喜的话。虽然伊丽莎白在一旁冷言冷语，但她并不认为这是桩不般配的婚姻。说起吉蒂和莉迪亚，她们可一点不眼红卢卡斯小姐，因为柯林斯先生只不过是个教士罢了。她们仅仅把此事当做小道消息，带到麦里屯传播传播，没有其他的念头。

以前，贝太太总爱炫耀自己有福气，眼见得女儿要嫁个好人家。而现在卢太太得了势，扬扬得意地对她进行报复。她往浪搏恩跑的趟数比平时勤多了，不知疲倦地向贝太太抒发自己的喜悦心情。贝太太怒容满面，说出的话尖酸刻薄，对方要是换上别人，早就兴致全消了。

伊丽莎白和夏洛特之间产生了隔阂，彼此对这桩事总是缄默不语。伊丽莎白觉得，她们之间再不存在真正的信任感了。由于对夏洛特大失所望，她便越发关心自己的姐姐了。姐姐为人正直、性情温和，她认为自己的这种对姐姐的看法永远都不会动摇。她一天比一天更为操心姐姐的幸福。宾利先生已经走了一个星期，却没有听到一点他要回来的消息。

简早就给卡罗琳写了回信，现正扳着手指头数日子，希望再接到来信。柯林斯先生答应写的感谢信于星期二就收到了。信是写给她们父亲的，充溢着铭感在心的语气，仿佛他在贝府叨扰了一年似的。表示完歉意之后，他把笔锋一转，用了大量欣喜若狂的字眼谈到了他的幸福。他告诉他们，他爱上了他们善良的女邻居卢卡斯小姐，并赢得了她的芳心。接着他又解释说，他当时答应了他们好意的请求，决定重访浪搏恩，就是为了早点见到自己的心上人。他希望能在两周后的星期一实现这一心愿。他还说，凯瑟琳夫人打心眼里赞成这门亲事，并希望他尽快操办。他认为，就凭这一点，可爱的夏洛特也会尽快择定佳期，使他成为一个最幸福的男人。

柯林斯要重返哈福德郡，这对贝太太来说，已经不再是件愉快的事了。她倒是站在丈夫的立场上，怨天尤人地发起了牢骚。真叫人觉得奇怪，柯林斯为什么不到卢卡斯府上当嘉宾，却偏偏要来浪搏恩落脚。这凭空要给她添许多不便和麻烦。她身体欠佳的时候，最讨厌家里来客人，尤其是那些含情脉脉的恋人。贝内特太太成天这样嘀咕来嘀咕去，只有当她想到至今未归的宾利先生，为他牵肠挂肚时，才会忘掉眼前的烦恼。

简和伊丽莎白也为这件事感到不安。一天天过去了，宾利先生一走便没了音讯。只听麦里屯传得沸沸扬扬，说他今年冬天不会再来尼瑟费德了。贝太太听后怒不可遏，总说这是恶意中伤的谣传。

就连伊丽莎白也开始担忧了。她不是害怕宾利薄情薄意，而是担心他的姐姐和妹妹诡计得逞，拦住他不放他回来。她实在不愿意生这种念头，觉得这既有损简的幸福，又有辱她那位恋人的忠贞，但她还是情不自禁地朝这方面想。宾利的姐姐和妹妹都是冷血动物，而他的那位朋友又是那样咄咄逼人，如果这几个人沆瀣一气，共同阻拦他，再加上达西小姐美丽风骚，伦敦又有那么多好玩的地方，他即便对简情真意笃，恐怕也难免变心。

在这样的压力面前，简自然比伊丽莎白更为担忧、更为痛苦。不过，她总把满腹的心事掩饰起来，从不向伊丽莎白提起，而伊丽莎白也从不过问。母亲就没有那样体谅她了。隔不了个把小时，她就要谈谈宾利，说她盼宾利回来已经盼得不耐烦了。她甚至还要求简公开自己心里的想法——假如宾利不回来，简是否会觉得她蒙受了奇耻大辱？幸亏简性情温和，才能够不动声色地忍受母亲的这种精神折磨。

两周后的星期一这天，柯林斯果然准时回来了。但是这一次，浪搏恩府上的人待他就大大不如初逢时那样热情友好了。不过，他实在太高兴了，才顾不上什么热情不热情呢。说起来也算主人家幸运，由于他忙着谈情说爱，就很少见他泡在贝府讨人嫌了。他每天都把大部分时间消磨在卢卡斯家。有时回来得太晚，浪搏恩府上的人都准备就寝了，他才赶回来说几句道歉的话。

贝太太的境况的确叫人可怜。谁一提到与这门亲事沾边的事，她就大动肝火、悲愤难捺。可是，不管她走到哪里，总会听到人们议论此事。一见到卢卡斯小姐，她就觉得讨厌。想到卢卡斯小姐将接替她的位置，成为这幢房子的主妇，她就越发妒忌她，憎恶她。每逢夏洛特来看望他们，她就怀疑人家急不可待地想接替这儿的财产，夏洛特和柯林斯低声说话的时候，她就认为他们在谈浪搏恩财产的事，在谈如何等贝内特先生过世后，将她们娘儿几个赶出家门。她心酸地把这些心事讲给丈夫听。

“说真的，贝内特先生，”她说道，“一想到夏洛特·卢卡斯将成为这幢房子的主妇，想到我将被迫离开这儿，眼睁睁地看着她接替我的位置，我就有点受不了！”

“亲爱的，别想这些忧愁的事儿，还是往好处想想吧。咱们还是放宽心吧，因为说不定我比你活得时间长呢。”

贝太太听了这席话，并没有从中得到多少慰藉。她没有搭丈夫的茬，而是自管自埋怨了下去。

“想到他们将要把这儿所有的财产都据为己有，我就觉得无法忍受，要不是那个遗产继承法，我才不管它呢。”

“你不管什么？”

“什么都不管。”

“谢天谢地，你的大脑还没有到麻木不仁的地步。”

“贝内特先生，对那个继承法，我没有一丝一毫的谢意。我不明白，世上竟有这么狠心的人，把财产从人家亲女儿的手中抢走——而且都是为了这个柯林斯先生！——为什么偏偏要把财产传给他，而不传给别人呢？”

“这问题还是由你自己好好想想吧。”贝内特先生说。





第二十四章


宾利小姐的信终于来了，澄清了所有的疑团。信上的头一句就指明，他们兄妹要在伦敦越冬，而结尾则为哥哥表示歉意，说他临走前没有来得及向哈福德郡的朋友们辞行，心里觉得老大过意不去。

希望破灭了，彻底破灭了。简继续读信时，发现除了写信人虚情假意的客气话外，没有一点能使她得到安慰的内容，满篇都是对达西小姐的颂扬之词，淋漓尽致地刻画了她的千娇百媚。接着，卡罗琳喜不自禁地写道，她和达西小姐越来越亲近，还预言说，她上封信中所披露的心愿一定能实现。最后，她扬扬得意地声称，她哥哥眼下就住在达西先生家，并且欢天喜地地提到达西先生打算添置新家具。

简立刻把这些事大致向伊丽莎白讲了一遍。伊丽莎白听后气炸了肺，但她什么也没说。她的心都破碎了，既为姐姐感到担忧，又怨恨那帮子人。卡罗琳在信中说她哥哥对达西小姐情意绵绵，这是她怎么也不会相信的。她一如既往，仍坚信宾利真心爱慕的是简。尽管她一向都很喜欢宾利，可是一想到他的性情过于随和，过于缺乏主见，一味屈从那些诡计多端的亲友，让他们牵着鼻子走，甚至置自己的幸福于不顾，她就觉得恼火，就觉得瞧不起他。如果牺牲的是他一个人的幸福，那他不管怎么折腾都可以，但是这里面也牵扯到了她姐姐的幸福。这一点，想必宾利也非常清楚。这是个叫人头疼的问题，就是花费再多的时间去思考，也不会得出个结果来。然而，伊丽莎白的整个大脑都纠缠在了这样一些方面：宾利先生究竟是真的变了心，还是让亲友逼得无可奈何；他究竟是看出了简的一片痴情，还是根本没有察觉？这其中的是非曲直虽然会影响到她对宾利的看法，但无论情况怎样，姐姐的处境却改变不了，反正姐姐的心情再也不能恢复往日的宁静。

一两天过去之后，简才鼓足了勇气，准备向伊丽莎白诉说自己的心思。当时，贝太太又抱怨起了尼瑟费德以及它的主人，而且牢骚话比平时多。等她最后离开了房间，剩下了简和伊丽莎白姐妹俩时，简这才开口讲道：

“唉，但愿妈妈能克制一下。她老人家哪里知道，这样一刻不停地把他提来提去，会给我带来多大的痛苦。不过，我没有什么可抱怨的。很快就会雨过天晴的。我们将会忘掉他，像从前那样生活。”

伊丽莎白简直不敢相信自己所听到的话，于是关切地望了望她，嘴里却什么也没说。

“你看来是不相信我的话，”简微红着脸嚷道，“那你就没有道理了。他可以作为我的一个亲密朋友留在我的记忆里，但仅此而已。我现在既没有奢望，也没有担忧，更没有必要去责备他。感谢上帝，我并没有痛不欲生的感觉。再过一段时间，我的心情还会更好些。”

她随即又用更为激昂的声音说道：“现在我只能这样安慰自己：都怪我自己想入非非，好在没有伤害别人，只伤害了我自己。”“亲爱的简！”伊丽莎白大声说道，“你真是太善良啦。你这么温和，这么无私，活像一个天使。实在不知道对你说些什么才好。我觉得，以前我待你太不公道，爱你爱得不够深。”

贝内特小姐竭力否定自己有什么非凡之处，而是称赞妹妹是个热心肠。懂得人情世故。

“得啦，”伊丽莎白说，“你这样考虑是不公正的。你总以为天下个个都是好人，我只要说谁的坏话，你就会觉得难过。我仅仅想把你看成一个完美无瑕的人，而你却尽说些反驳的话。请你放心，我不会做出过分的事情，禁止你去用善良的尺度衡量所有的人。其实，你没必要担心。我真心喜欢的人为数不多，器重的人就更是寥若晨星了。世面见得越广，我对人世间的事情就越加厌恶。每过一天，我就越加相信，人的天性是口是心非、出尔反尔，所谓的道德和理性根本靠不住。最近发生的两件事情就是例子，其中的一件我不愿再提，而另一件就是夏洛特的亲事。真是莫名其妙！无论从哪一个方面看，都叫人理解不透！”

“亲爱的丽茨，不要这般感情用事，否则你就永远快活不起来。你对处境的不同以及性格的差异考虑得不够。应该多想想柯林斯先生的体面地位以及夏洛特谨慎稳重的性格。不要忘了，夏洛特家里的人口相当多。说到财产，这倒是一桩非常合适的婚姻。看在大家的分上，你就权当她对我们的表兄确有几分爱慕和敬意吧。”

“为了使你高兴，我几乎什么事情都可以相信，可这对任何人都不会有好处。假如让我相信夏洛特当真爱慕柯林斯，那我就会觉得她不仅缺乏感情，而且还缺乏理智。亲爱的简，柯林斯先生是个自高自大、心胸狭窄的蠢汉，这一点你和我心里都清楚。哪个女人嫁给他，就一定是头脑糊涂。虽说这个女人就是夏洛特·卢卡斯，你也不必为她充当辩护士。你不能为了一个人就改变原则和准绳，自欺欺人地认为自私是谨慎，而胆大妄为能够争取到幸福。”

“我觉得，你在谈论他们两人时，使用的语言未免太尖刻了。希望你看到他们幸福相处时，能够意识到自己的偏颇。此事就说到这里吧。另外，你还提到了别的事情，提到了两个什么例子。我不会误解你的意思，不过我恳求你不要责怪和瞧不起那个人，免得让我感到痛苦，亲爱的丽茨。我们不应该随随便便地认为人家存心伤害我们，不应该指望一个活蹦乱跳的小伙子时时当心、处处谨慎。我们往往会让虚荣心迷住心窍。女人对爱情的幻想是不切合实际的。”

“正是由于男人们精心安排，她们才耽于幻想。”

“如果男人们果真别有用心，那就是他们的不对。不过，我看天下并非似有些人想象的那样，到处都是阴谋诡计。”

“我绝不是说宾利先生的行为是经过预谋的，”伊丽莎白解释道，“然而，即便不是存心做坏事，或者说，不是有意叫别人伤心，也照样能铸成大错，照样能招致不幸的后果。凡是粗心大意、无视别人的感情，或者优柔寡断，都一样能害人。”

“你把这件事也归咎于这类原因吗？”

“是的，归咎于最后一种。如果你要是让我再讲下去，说出我对你所尊敬的那些人的看法，准会惹得你不高兴。所以，你还是趁早制止我吧。”

“这么说。你还是认为他的姐姐和妹妹操纵了他？”

“是的，而且是和他的那个朋友合谋。”

“这无法叫我相信。要说她们操纵宾利，那目的何在呢？她们难道不希望他得到幸福吗？如果他爱的是我，别的女人就不能够给他带来幸福。”

“你的头一个想法就错了。她们除了希望他得到幸福，还有许多别的打算。她们希望他敛财聚富、光宗耀祖，希望他娶一个有钱有势、声名显赫人家的小姐。”

“毫无疑问，她们希望他选择达西小姐，”简说，“不过，她们的用心可能比你想象的要好。她们认识达西小姐比认识我要早得多，难怪她们更喜欢她。可是，不管她们的愿望如何，她们总不至于非得和自己亲兄弟的意愿背道而驰吧。除非遇到了特别不顺眼的事，否则，作为一个姐姐或者妹妹，有什么理由干涉自己兄弟的行为呢？要是她们坚信我和宾利先生相爱，就不会拆散我们。话又说回来，假如宾利真心爱我，那她们就是想拆也拆不散。你硬说宾利先生钟情于我，这岂不是在指责大家办事过于荒唐、过于缺德吗？这只能增加我的痛苦。所以，不要用这种想法折磨我了。我自作多情，误解了他的意思，可我并不感到羞愧——即便感到羞愧也微乎其微。相比之下，要是把他或他的姐姐妹妹朝坏里想，那我就真的愧对人们了。能饶人处且饶人，还是从合乎人情事理的方面考虑问题吧。”

对于这样一种善良的愿望，伊丽莎白不好加以反对。自此，姐妹俩之间就几乎再也没提过宾利先生的名字。

贝内特太太仍然不理解宾利为什么一去不复返，所以牢骚话就没有间断过。伊丽莎白差不多每天都要给她作一番解释，可是不顶用，反而让她越听越糊涂。伊丽莎白讲的全是些连她自己也不相信的道理，说什么宾利先生对简的爱只是人们常见的逢场作戏而已，一旦见不到面，也就情淡意消了。贝内特太太虽然当时也承认这话有可能是真的，但每天却要旧事重提。她最能聊以自慰的是，宾利先生想必来年夏天还会再来。

贝内特先生对这件事的态度却迥然不同。一天，他对伊丽莎白说道：

“丽茨，我发现你的姐姐失恋了，这真是值得祝贺。姑娘家不仅热衷于结婚，有时候还喜欢尝尝失恋的滋味。这样就有了可以回味的东西，同时还可以在女友面前炫耀炫耀。什么时候能轮到你呢？你总不会甘心久居简之后吧。要论机会，还是有的。麦里屯的军官多如牛毛，足以让这一带所有的姑娘都尝到失恋的滋味。你可以选威克姆做意中人呀。他倒是个挺不错的小伙子，将来遗弃你的时候一定会做得冠冕堂皇。”

“谢谢您的关心，爸爸。那样出色的人儿我可高攀不起。我们不能指望个个都交上简那样的桃花运。”

“此话不假，”贝先生说，“不过，无论你交上什么样的运气，反正你有个关怀备至的好妈妈，总会把事情替你安排得天衣无缝。想想这点，也就叫人放心了。”

浪搏恩府上近来发生了几桩不称心的事，害得好些人都愁眉不展。幸亏有威克姆先生常来常往，才算冲淡了一些大家心头上的阴霾。威克姆还似从前那样和善亲切，只不过又添了一条新的优点——对所有的人都开诚布公。，他把自己曾经对伊丽莎白讲过的那些话和盘托出，说什么达西先生亏待了他，叫他吃了不少苦头等。他的遭遇引起了大家的同情，成为人们公开议论的话题。大伙儿想起来就扬扬得意，因为他们在未了解事情的真相之前，就已经讨厌透了那个达西先生。

只有贝内特小姐一人觉得，这里边可能别有原因，只是哈福德郡的人们还不了解罢啦。简生性善良、稳重公正，提倡考虑问题要留有余地，认为干什么事情都可能会出现阴差阳错的情况。可是其他的人却众口铄金，把达西视为十恶不赦的坏蛋。





第二十五章


一周来，柯林斯先生一边谈情说爱，一边筹划喜事，不知不觉到了星期六，只得和心爱的夏洛特依依而别。幸亏他忙于迎娶新娘，才减轻了一些离恨别愁。他有理由相信，下一次重返哈福德郡时，马上便可择定佳期，使他成为最幸福的男人。他向浪搏恩的亲戚们辞行时，神情仍是那般庄严肃穆，祝愿他漂亮的表妹们身体健康、生活幸福，许下诺言要给她们的父亲再写一封感谢信来。

到了星期一，贝太太欢天喜地地迎接了弟弟和弟媳。这两口子是按照惯例，来浪搏恩过圣诞节的。加德纳先生通情达理，一言一行都彬彬有礼，无论是在天性方面还是在修养方面，都比他的姐姐强得多。一个靠做买卖为营生、眼睛整日盯着自己那小货栈的人，居然如此富于教养，如此温文尔雅，若是叫尼瑟费德的娘儿们瞧见，要相信才有鬼了呢。加德纳太太比贝太太和菲利普斯太太年轻好几岁，是个和蔼、聪慧、文雅的女人，在浪搏恩深受外甥女们的爱戴。两个大外甥女和她特别近乎，时常到城里去陪伴她。

加德纳太太刚一来到，头一件事就是分发礼品和讲述最新的服装款式。这件事一做完，她就不那么活跃了，下来就该她洗耳恭听了。贝太太憋了一肚子的委屈要倾吐，有满腹的牢骚要发泄。她说自从上次和弟媳分别后，她一家人受尽了欺凌，两个大女儿眼看着就要嫁人了，可到头来空欢喜了一场。

“我不责怪简，”她继续说道，“因为要是能办得到的话，她早就嫁给宾利先生了。可是丽茨的情况就不同啦，回想起来真气死人，我的弟媳呵！要不是她任性，她现在早当上柯林斯先生的太太了。柯林斯就在这个房间里向她求过婚，但是却碰了一鼻子灰。结果可就惨了——卢卡斯太太倒抢在了我前边，要把女儿嫁出门；浪搏恩的财产以后照样由别人继承。卢卡斯一家人都是些滑头，净想拣便宜占，我的弟媳。我本不该说他们的坏话，不过事实的确如此。家里的人惹我生气不说，又遇上了光顾自己而不考虑别人的邻居，害得我神经痛，身体糟得一塌糊涂。你来得正是时候，给了我极大的安慰。我就喜欢听你讲长袖子服装那些事。”

加德纳太太先前从简和伊丽莎白给她写的信中，大体上了解了近来发生的事情，可又不得不敷衍贝太太几句。她非常同情两个外甥女的遭遇，于是将话题岔开了。

后来，她和伊丽莎白单独在一起的时候，又谈起了这方面的事。“简的那门子亲事好像比较理想，”她说，“只可惜泡汤了。这种事情太常见了！一般来说，小伙子的爱情不专一，几个星期内就可以顺顺当当迷恋上漂亮的姑娘，可一旦有件偶然的事情把情侣们分开，小伙子转身便可以将姑娘忘掉。你所说的宾利先生不就是这样吗？”

“您这话是变着法子安慰人，”伊丽莎白说，“不过，对我们却不起效用。我们吃的并不是偶然事件的亏。一个不靠天、不靠地的年轻人几天前还和一位姑娘打得火热，可后来竟然听任亲友的摆布，把姑娘给甩了。这种事情可是不常见的。”

“可是，‘打得火热’这个字眼未免太陈腐、太含混、太笼统了，叫我听不出什么来。这种词既可以用来形容情真意挚的强烈的爱，也常用来形容相识半小时后所迸发的感情。请问，宾利先生的爱究竟能火热到什么程度呢？”

“我从来没见到过像他那样一往情深的人。他的眼里只有简一个，对周围的人不理不睬。’他们俩每见一次面，事情就越加明朗，越加露骨。宾利举办了一次舞会，却不请别人跳舞，结果得罪了两三位年轻小姐。我曾经两次跟他说话，他都带答不理。还有什么征兆能比这更明显呢？为了一个人而怠慢大家，这难道不是爱情的真谛所在？”

“对，言之有理。我想，他的确怀着一颗爱心。可怜的简！我为她感到难过，因为按她那种性格，不可能一下子就振作起来。要是事情发生在你头上就好啦，丽茨。你一定会付之一笑，很快地忘掉烦恼。如果劝简到我们那儿，你觉得怎么样？走出家门，换换环境，也许能使她放松一下，给她带来一定的好处。”

伊丽莎白听到这项建议，简直高兴到了极点。她认为姐姐肯定会欣然领受。

接下来，加德纳太太又说道：“但愿她不要因为害怕见到那位青年而犹豫不决。我们和他虽然都住在城里，但区域不同，认识的人也不一样，再加上我们整日深居简出，所以他和你姐姐不大可能邂逅，除非他找上门来看望她。”

“那种情况是绝对不会出现的。达西先生现在严密监视着他的一举一动，不会同意他到那样一个区域去同简叙旧！亲爱的舅妈，亏您想得出来，达西先生对格雷斯丘奇大街或许有所耳闻，但是真要是让他去一趟，他会觉得身上沾染的污垢一个月也洗不干净。请您放心，他和宾利先生历来是形影不离的。”

“那正好求之不得呢。希望宾利先生和简千万不要见面。不过，简和他的妹妹不是有通信来往吗？宾利小姐恐怕难免要来串个门。”

“宾利小姐巴不得和她一刀两断哩。”

伊丽莎白在阐明自己的观点时尽管装出一副深信不疑的样子，而且还一口断定，说宾利受到了钳制，不能和简见面，但是她考虑再三，经过反复权衡，又觉得这事情并没有完全绝望。有时候她觉得宾利很可能会对简旧情复燃，因为亲友们的百般阻挠敌不过简的万种风情所形成的自然诱惑。

贝内特小姐欣喜地接受了舅妈的邀请。当时，她的脑子里并没有太多考虑宾利兄妹的存在。她仅仅希望卡罗琳和她的哥哥不住在一起，那样她就可以在上午寻机会去和卡罗琳聊天，而不至于撞见她哥哥。

加德纳两口子在浪搏恩住了一个星期，少不得和菲利普斯夫妇、卢卡斯夫妇以及军官们周旋和往来，每天都要大吃大喝。贝内特太太悉心款待弟弟和弟媳，没让他们吃过一顿家常便饭。但凡家中设宴，总有几名军官列席，而且次次都少不了威克姆先生。每逢这种场合，伊丽莎白都要热情称赞威克姆，叫加德纳太太起了疑心病，于是加德纳太太细心观察起他们来。据她看来，两位年轻人不像是坠入了情网，只是彼此产生了好感。不过，这足以使她坐卧不宁了。她决定在离开哈福德郡之前和伊丽莎白好好谈谈，向她说明，发展这样的关系未免有些轻率。

威克姆对加德纳太太倒有一套取悦邀宠的办法，这与他讨好众人的本领截然不同。大约十多年以前，加德纳太太还没结婚的时候，曾在德比郡威克姆的那个区域住过很长一段时间。因此，他们俩共同认识不少人。自从达西的父亲于五年前去世之后，威克姆很少再到那儿去，但他对朋友们的近况非常了解，讲起来如数家珍。他掌握的消息总比加德纳太太知道的新鲜。

加德纳太太曾经亲眼看到过彭伯里，对已故的老达西先生也是久闻大名。光凭这一点，就是个谈不完的话题。她把威克姆先生详细描绘的彭伯里与她记忆中的彭伯里作了比较，又把彭伯里已故主人的德行称赞了一番，让威克姆听了高兴，她自己也其乐悠悠。当威克姆控诉小达西先生的罪行时，她便努力去回忆小达西童年时的情况，以便能和他现在的作为吻合。最后，她终于自信地宣称，她以前听人谈起过菲茨威廉·达西先生，说他是个目空一切、专横跋扈的孩子。





第二十六章


加德纳太太找了个适当的机会，当旁边无他人在场的时候，便不失时机地、好言好语地劝诫伊丽莎白，直言不讳地谈了自己的看法。之后，她又说了这样一番话：

“丽茨，你是个通事理的姑娘，不会因为别人劝你不要爱某人，你就非得爱不行。所以，我才敢开诚布公地跟你谈话。说正经的，我提醒你不可大意马虎。千万不要让自己坠入情网，也别勾引他坠入情网。跟没有财产的人谈情说爱，是一种冒失的行为。我倒不是对他本人有什么成见。他诙谐风趣，要是得到了属于自己的那份财产，那我就会觉得你嫁给他是再好不过了。可是，事实既然如此，你就不该感情用事、想入非非了。你是个有头脑的人，我们都希望你多斟酌斟酌，长点心眼。我知道，你父亲对你期望较大，认为你处事果断、品行端正。你可不能让他老人家大失所望啊。”

“亲爱的舅妈，这话说得可有些分量太重啦。”

“是的。我希望你不要抱着玩世不恭的态度。”

“啧啧，您没必要为我担惊受怕。我能招呼好自己。也将提防着威克姆先生。只要我力所能及，就绝不让他爱上我。”

“伊丽莎白，这话可就说得不严肃了。”

“请您原谅，容我再给您解释一下。就目前而言，我还没有爱上威克姆先生，这是有目共睹的。不过，他可是我所见到过的最可爱的男人，简直是无与伦比。如果他真心实意钟情于我——老天，但愿这种事情不要发生——我可就把握不住自己了。这话听起来有些荒唐……噢，那个可恶的达西先生会怎么想呢！……我父亲如此器重我，使我感到莫大的荣幸，我绝不忍心辜负了他。不过，我的父亲对那位威克姆先生也有偏爱之心。总而言之，亲爱的舅妈，冒犯了你们任何一个人都会叫我万分难过。然而，我们天天都看得到，年轻人一旦相亲相爱，很少因为手头缺钱便分道扬镳，我要是动了真心，哪敢担保自己就比其他的芸芸众生明智持重呢？或者说，我怎么知道回绝人家就一定明智呢？因此，我只能答应您不匆忙行事。我不会匆匆忙忙就自以为是他的意中人。我和他在一起的时候，将打消一切私心杂念。总之，我一定要尽力而为。”

“也许，你应该为他泼些冷水，叫他别来得太勤。至少，你不要提示你的母亲邀请他来。”

“不错，那天是我做得不对，”伊丽莎白难为情地笑了笑说，“以后我得学乖些，不让这类事情重演。不过，您别以为他平时也是这么一趟趟朝这儿跑。这个星期，全是为了你们才请他请得频繁了些。您了解我妈妈的心意，她总认为家里来了亲友就得常有人陪着。我以我的名誉担保，我一定要用最明智的方法处理好这方面的事情。这下您该满意了吧。”

舅妈说她很赞赏伊丽莎白所说的话。伊丽莎白感谢了她的好意告诫，之后，两人便分手了。在这种事情上给人提忠告，却没有遭到对方的怨恨，这可算是个绝好的例子。

加德纳夫妇带着简走后不久，柯林斯先生便回到了哈福德郡来。这次，他把大本营扎到了卢家，所以没有给贝太太添多少麻烦。他的婚期已指日可待，贝太太也就死了心，觉得事情已无法挽回，甚至还以恶毒的语气几次三番地说：“但愿他们幸福美满。”婚礼定在星期四举行，卢卡斯小姐于星期三前来辞行。等她起身告别的时候，贝太太阴阳怪气地违背心愿说了些祝福的话。伊丽莎白为母亲的态度觉得难为情，另一方面心里委实有些激动，便陪着女友走出了房间。在下楼的时候，夏洛特对她说道：

“我相信你一定会常给我写信，伊丽莎白。”

“这请你放心。”

“另外，我还有一个请求，你肯去看我吗？”

“希望咱们能常在哈福德郡见面。”

“我可能暂时离不开肯特郡。还是答应我，到亨斯福德去吧。”

伊丽莎白虽然料想到那儿去不会有什么乐趣，可又不好推辞。

“我父亲和玛丽亚三月份要去看我，”夏洛特说，“如不嫌弃，找希望你和他们结伴同行。老实讲，伊丽莎，我将会伸长脖子盼望你们到。”

第二天婚礼过后，新郎和新娘从教堂门口直接到肯特郡去了。大伙儿像往常办喜事一样，少不得要在一块议论议论。没过多久，伊丽莎白便收到了朋友的来信。自此，她们你一封我一封地靠书信保持联络。可是，她们已经不能再畅所欲言、倾吐心声了。伊丽莎白每逢给她写信，总觉得过去那种亲密无间的快慰感已不复存在。她虽然决定和夏洛特继续保持通讯，但那与其说是为了现在的交情，倒不如说是为了昔日的友谊。她收到夏洛特的头几封信时，还真有几分热切盼望的劲头，不过那全是出于好奇，想了解夏洛特对自己新家的感想以及对凯瑟琳夫人的看法，想了解夏洛特到底能幸福到什么程度。读完信后，她发现夏洛特在每件事上的看法都和她预料的一模一样。夏洛特的笔调喜气洋洋，好像她生活在极乐世界，没有一样东西不值得她称赞。住房、家具、邻居、道路，样样令她称心如意；凯瑟琳夫人待她极为和善、友好。她的话和柯林斯先生对亨斯福德及罗辛斯的刻画不差上下，只是比较委婉些罢了。伊丽莎白觉得，她必须等待时机到那儿亲眼瞧瞧，才能摸清底细。

话说简抵达伦敦之后，给伊丽莎白来了封信报平安。伊丽莎白希望她下次写信时，能谈些有关宾利兄妹的情况。

一般来说，无论任何事情，你越是心急火燎，就越难如愿以偿。伊丽莎白盼到了第二封信后，却大失所望，原来，简白白在城里待了一个星期，既没有见到卡罗琳的面，也没听到她的任何音讯。她在解释这件事的时候说，她从浪搏恩写给卡罗琳的最后那封信可能因故丢失了。

接下来，她在信中这样写道：“舅妈明天要到那个城区，我想趁机到格罗斯维诺大街了解一下情况。”

简在走访了格罗斯维诺大街之后，又写来了一封信，说她见到了宾利小姐。她的原话是这样说的：“我觉得卡罗琳的情绪不太高。不过，她倒是挺高兴见到我，责怪我来伦敦也不给她打个招呼。看来我先前猜得一点不错，她果然没有收到我的最后一封信。后来，我问起了她哥哥的情况。她说宾利先生一切都好，只是成天与达西先生泡在一起，很少露面。当时，卡罗琳和赫斯特太太要出去赴宴，所以我不便久留。我对她们讲，希望她们能到舅妈家做客。我敢说，她们一定会来的。”

伊丽莎白边读信边不住地摇头。她意识到，除非出现奇迹，否则宾利先生绝不会知道她的姐姐已经到了伦敦。

四个星期过去了，简连宾利的人影也没见到。她总是竭力自我安慰，说她并不因此而感到难过。不过，对于宾利小姐的冷漠无情，她再也不会视而不见了。每天早晨她都在家中恭候宾利小姐的到来，而每天晚上都替她编造一个借口。就这样苦苦等了两个星期，最后才算把客人等了来。不过，宾利小姐把屁股没暖热就要走，而且态度也发生了变化，这叫简无法再欺骗自己了。从这次她写给妹妹的信中，就可以看出她的心情。


最亲爱的丽茨：

我承认我完全误解了宾利小姐对我的感情。看来你认人比我认得准，但我希望你不要因此而瞧不起我。事实证明你的观点是正确的。不过，从她以前的态度看来，我仍然认为我对她的信任以及你对她的怀疑，是同样合情合理的。请你不必责怪我冥顽不化。我至今都不明白她当初和我套近乎究竟是出于什么目的。如果再发生同样的情况，我觉得我还会上当受骗。卡罗琳直到昨天才来回访我，在此之前，我没收到她的片纸只字。来后，她满脸的不高兴，只是敷衍了事地为自己的姗姗来迟道了声歉，而且绝口不提想和我再见面的话。她与以前的卡罗琳简直判若两人。临到她走时，我已铁下了心和她一刀两断、各奔东西。我虽然禁不住要责怪她，但是又可怜她。当初她真不该对我那么好。我敢说，我们之所以关系亲密，完全是由她一步步造成的。我说可怜她，是因为她一定知道自己在充当着不光彩的角色，只是为了她哥哥考虑才不得已而为之。下来我就不用再解释了。我们都清楚，她的多虑是完全没有必要的，但既然她如此关心哥哥，就难怪她那样对待我。宾利先生值得她去爱，所以无论她怎样为宾利先生着想，都是有情可原，动机是好的。不过，我不知道她现在还有什么可顾虑的。假若宾利先生真的有心于我，老早就会跑来见我了。听他妹妹的话音，他肯定知道我来到了伦敦。然而从宾利小姐说话的态度看来，她似乎还拿不准她的哥哥是否真心爱恋达西小姐。这实在叫人捉摸不透。要不是害怕作出草率的结论，我肯定会说这里边大有文章。可是，我所要做的只是打消一切痛苦的念头，多想些高兴的东西——你对我的深情厚谊以及舅父舅母的热心关照。希望很快能收到你的来信。宾利小姐说起她哥哥不会再回尼瑟费德，说他们准备放弃那所房子，不过口气却不那么肯定。这件事咱们就不用再提了。令人高兴的是，你从亨斯福德的朋友们那儿听到了许多愉快的事情。你应该随威廉爵士和玛丽亚去看看他们。我相信，你的旅行一定会轻松自在。





你的姐姐



读完信后，伊丽莎白感到有些难受。可一想到姐姐从此再不会上当受骗，起码不受宾利小姐的骗，她又高兴了起来。她对宾利先生的所有期望都化为乌有了，甚至不再希望他会来重修旧好。她倒希望他早日和达西小姐成婚，以此作为对他的惩罚，这样可能对简有好处。因为根据威克姆所说的话，达西小姐定会叫他后悔莫及，叫他后悔不该抛掉真正的爱情。

大约就在这时，加德纳太太来信提醒伊丽莎白，说她曾经答应过及时汇报她和那位先生的关系，并询问起进展情况。伊丽莎白写了封回信，里面的内容没有给她自己多少满足感，却叫舅母心花怒放。原来，威克姆先生对她所表现过的热情已消失殆尽，而现在他把注意力转移到别的姑娘身上，和别人打情骂俏去了。细心的伊丽莎白把这些全看在了眼里，并写到了信中，可她没有感到难过。她的心里只是稍微起了些涟漪。同时，她的虚荣感也得到了满足，因为她坚信，若非牵扯到财产问题，她肯定是威克姆的唯一选择。要说威克姆痴情追求的那位年轻小姐，其最大的魅力就是能让他发一笔横财，拿到手一万英镑。伊丽莎白在夏洛特的婚事上洞察秋毫，而现在却鬼迷心窍，没有责备他贪财薄情。相反，她觉得这是一个最理想的出路。在她看来，威克姆一定经过了反复的思想斗争才放弃了她。她认为，对他们俩来说这都是明智体面的抉择，所以，她诚心诚意祝他幸福。

这些细节，她都吐露给了加德纳太太。把情况说明之后，接下来她在信中又这样写道：

“我现在深信不疑，亲爱的舅妈，我从来就没有坠入过爱河。假使我当真萌发过这种纯洁而崇高的感情，那我现在一提他的名字就会觉得厌恶，而且巴不得他倒霉遭殃。可是，我对他的感情是真诚的，甚至对金小姐也毫无成见。我一点也不觉得恨金小姐，而且极其愿意把她看成一个出类拔萃的姑娘。这证明我没有爱上威克姆。我的谨慎小心并不是枉然无效的。如果我疯狂地迷恋上他，势必会成为亲戚朋友注目的中心。不过，我绝不会因为没出成风头而留下遗憾。有的时候，要想受到重视，就得付出高昂的代价。对于威克姆的喜新厌旧，吉蒂和莉迪亚比我可就要计较得多了。在人情世故方面，她们毕竟还很幼稚，还不懂得这样一个难登大雅之堂的道理——不管是美貌青年还是丑陋青年，都得穿衣吃饭。”





第二十七章


浪搏恩府上起了些小风波，但没有发生过大的事件。贝家姐妹们唯一的消遣就是步行到麦里屯去，有时踏着泥泞，而有时顶着严寒。一月和二月就这样悄然流逝了。三月间，伊丽莎白要去亨斯福德。起初，她并没把这趟旅行当回事，可她很快就发现，夏洛特是极端认真的。于是，她也就逐渐端正了态度，坚定了信念，高高兴兴地准备启程了。离别时间长了，她特别想见到夏洛特，与此同时，她对柯林斯先生的厌恶感也在一天天减弱。再说，这趟旅行可以叫人耳目一新，家里有这样一个母亲和这样几个不融洽的妹妹，真是让伊丽莎白难以容身。如能换换环境，对她自会有好处。况且，顺路还可以去看看简。总而言之，随着行期的接近，她的心情也愈加急切，连一天也不愿耽误了。一切准备工作都进展顺利，最后她决定采用夏洛特起初提出的方案，和威廉爵士及其次女结伴同行。他们对日程安排稍作更改，决定在伦敦逗留一夜。这样的计划可谓周密细致、尽善尽美。

伊丽莎白唯一感到不忍的是远离父亲，他老人家一定会挂念她的。临别之时，父亲实在舍不得放她走，叮咛她要写信来家，并且差点吐口说也给她回信。

她和威克姆先生辞行时，双方都非常友好，尤其威克姆，表现得更是客客气气。他现在已爱上了佳丽，但他怎么也忘记不了伊丽莎白曾是第一个引起他注目并值得他注目的女子，第一个听他倾诉衷情，第一个怜悯他的人，也是第一个博得了他爱慕的姑娘。和伊丽莎白惜别之际，他祝愿她万事如意，并重申了自己对凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人的观点，相信伊丽莎白对那位贵夫人的看法以及对所有人的看法，都会和他的吻合。说这番话时，他显得异常真诚和关切。就凭这一点。伊丽莎白也觉得要永远和他至诚相待。跟他分手之后，她相信，不管威克姆今后结婚与否，在她的心目中都始终是和蔼可亲而又讨人喜欢的楷模。

翌日与她结伴同行的两个人和威克姆比起来，可就相形见绌了。威廉爵士愚昧无知，他的女儿玛丽亚虽然脾气不错，但也头脑空虚，父女俩说出的话没有半句中听的。听他们唠叨，就像听车子的辘辘声一样无聊乏味。伊丽莎白本来对一些无稽之谈是非常感兴趣的，怎奈威廉爵士的那一套她早已听腻了。他谈来谈去无外乎觐见国王以及荣膺爵士头衔之类的奇闻，翻不出别的新花样来。他待人接物的那些礼仪规矩，也和他说出的话一样迂腐陈旧。

这段旅程只有二十四英里。他们早早地动身，是为了正午赶到格雷斯丘奇街去。当马车驶近加德纳先生的家门口时，简正在客厅里倚窗远眺。她步出房门，在甬道里迎住了他们。伊丽莎白关切地打量着姐姐的面孔，见她仍似从前一样健康、美丽，心中不由大喜。她们的几个小表弟、小表妹急着见伊丽莎白，所以在客厅里早等不及了。可是，由于一年未见过面，他们难免有些怯生生的，便一起挤在楼梯口不肯下来。大家都兴高采烈、亲切友好，在极其愉快的气氛中度过了一天。上午，一家人忙忙碌碌，还要出去买东西，而晚上到戏院里看戏。

伊丽莎白有意坐到了舅妈身旁，一开始就和她扯起了姐姐的情况。她详详细细问了许多话，结果听到的回答不仅令她觉得诧异，更使她感到悲伤。舅妈说，简虽然总是强打精神，但有时仍可以看到她神情沮丧、郁郁寡欢。好在这只是暂时的现象，不会持续得太久。接下来，加德纳太太一五一十向伊丽莎白讲述了宾利小姐走访格雷斯丘奇大街的详细情况，并复述了一遍她跟简的几次谈话内容。从她说到的情况看来，简已经心灰意冷，决计与宾利小姐断绝来往。

加德纳太太然后讥笑伊丽莎白让威克姆给甩了，不过又称赞她精神可嘉，没有因此而一蹶不振。

“亲爱的伊丽莎白，”她继续说道，“金小姐是个什么样的姑娘？我可不愿把咱们的那位朋友看成一个贪图钱财的小人。”

“请问，亲爱的舅妈，在婚姻大事上贪财和慎重的区别何在？慎重的终点在哪里？而贪财又从哪里开始？去年圣诞节，您生怕我和他结婚，认为那样过于轻率。现在，他爱上了一个手中仅有一万英镑的姑娘，您又说他贪图钱财。”

“你只要告诉我，金小姐属于哪一类人，我就能分辨出是非曲直了。”

“我相信她是个非常出色的姑娘，而威克姆对她也毫无加害之心。”

“可他以前从未把金小姐放在眼里。直到金小姐继承了祖父的一笔遗产，他这才如蚁附膻，对她热乎了起来。”

“没有的事，他没有必要那样做。既然他嫌我没钱，就不愿和我谈恋爱，那他为什么非得去追求一个同样贫穷，而且他并不喜欢的姑娘呢？”

“金姑娘刚继承了一点钱，他便立刻穷追不舍，未免有些太庸俗了吧。”

“人们都喜欢讲究体面和论论排场，但一个处境窘迫的人就无暇顾及这些穷规矩了。既然金小姐都不在乎，咱们又何必斤斤计较呢？”

“她不在乎，并不意味着他就做得对。这只能说明她本身有缺陷——不是在理智上，就是在感情上。”

“好啦，好啦，”伊丽莎白嚷嚷了起来，“您爱怎么说就怎么说吧。就算威克姆是个唯利是图的小人，金小姐是个缺心眼的笨蛋。”

“不，丽茨，这并非我的本意。我真不忍心把一个在德比郡住了这么久的青年说得一无是处。”

“哦，”伊丽莎白叫道，“不能凭这一点来判断人。我倒真有些瞧不起德比郡的年轻人哩。另外，他们那些住在哈福德郡的挚友亲朋也好不到哪儿去。那些人全都让我觉得恶心。谢天谢地，明天我要去拜访一个无论是行为举止还是思想观念都很粗俗的人。在这个年头，只有傻里傻气的人，还值得结交一下。”

“当心点，丽茨，你这话未免太悲观失望了。”

看完戏要分手的时候，伊丽莎白喜出望外地受到舅父和舅母的邀请，要她参加他们的夏季旅游。

“我们还未最后拿定主意究竟到哪儿去，”加德纳太太说，“很可能将赴湖区赏景。”

这项计划对伊丽莎白可以说正中下怀，所以她怀着感恩不尽的心情，毫不迟疑地接受了邀请。“舅妈啊，亲爱的舅妈。叫人高兴死啦！真是太幸福了！你们给了我新的生命和活力。我再也不会精神沮丧或意气消沉了。比起高山和巨石，人显得是多么渺小。想想吧，一踏上旅途，咱们该会多么地快活！当咱们尽兴而归时，绝不会像其他游人一样稀里糊涂，对自己所看到的东西说不出个眉目来。咱们一定能记得住自己到过的地方，对所见所闻定能如数家珍般回忆起来。湖泊和山川不会在咱们的脑子里堆积起来、混为一谈。在描绘某一种景色时，咱们绝不会为其地理位置争论不休。旅游归来谈天说地之时，咱们绝不会像一般游客那样，讲出的话漏洞百出，经不起推敲。”





第二十八章


第二天，旅途上所见到的一草一木，对伊丽莎白都是那样新鲜，那样有趣。她的整个身心都沉浸在欢乐之中。看到自己的姐姐红光满面，她的那颗悬着的心彻底落了下来。再说，北方之行深深吸引了她，使她感到由衷的高兴。

离开大路，他们拐到了通向亨斯福德去的小径上。大家都在用目光搜索柯林斯的宅院，每转一个弯都期望它蓦然出现在眼前。当他们沿着罗辛斯庄园的栅栏朝前走时，伊丽莎白不由暗自发笑，因为她回想起了那些有关庄园主人的传闻。

最后，柯林斯的教士住宅终于依稀可辨了。向大路倾斜的花园、花园里的小屋、绿色的栅栏和月桂树篱，这一切迹象都表明，他们已经到达了目的地。柯林斯先生和夏洛特出现在门口，宾主们一个个笑容满面、频频点头。马车在一道小门前停了下来，从这里穿过一小截石子路，便能直达大房子。转眼之间，客人下了马车，宾主相见，分外高兴。柯林斯太太欢天喜地地向女友表示欢迎。伊丽莎白受到如此热情的接待，心里越加高兴，对这趟旅行感到十分满意。她立即发现，表兄虽然已娶亲成家，但他的言谈举止却未因此而改变。他还似从前那样拘泥于礼节，把她拦在门口，逐个问起她一家大小的情况。伊丽莎白一一作答，否则他绝不会善罢干休。随后，柯林斯着意炫耀了一下他家整齐清洁的过道。接下来，他没有再耽误大家，领着大家浩浩荡荡开进了大房子。一来到客厅里，他又一次向诸位嘉宾表示了欢迎。他拿腔拿调地说，各位亲友能光临他的寒舍，使他倍感荣幸。紧接着，他又恰到好处地把他太太要求为客人端点心的客气话又重复了一遍。

伊丽莎白早就预料到他会夸夸其谈、得意忘形。此刻，她情不自禁地想到，柯林斯滔滔不绝地炫耀房子优美的结构、式样以及里面的陈设，是特意讲给她听的，仿佛是想让她明白，她当初拒绝了他该是个多么大的损失。可是，尽管所有的一切都是那样井井有条、整洁舒适，伊丽莎白却没有露出丝毫懊悔的表情以满足他的虚荣心，而是以诧异的目光盯着自己的女友，真不明白她和这样一个人在一起生活，居然还会这么高兴。柯林斯时不时就说上几句叫他的太太感到脸发烧的话。每逢这种场合，伊丽莎白便不由自主地要瞧瞧夏洛特。有一两次，她发现夏洛特脸上微微泛红，但一般来说，夏洛特总是装聋卖傻，佯作没听见。客人们在大厅里坐了很长时间，先是对屋里的每一件家具，从餐具柜到壁炉架，都赞赏了一通，然后便讲起了路上的经历以及伦敦的情况。在这之后，柯林斯邀请他们到花园里散步。他的花园面积很大，结构布局别具匠心，园内的活计全由柯林斯亲自料理，因为栽花植树是他最高雅的情趣之一。夏洛特说，务花弄草有益于健康，所以她竭力支持丈夫从事这种劳动。她说这话时，神情自若、一本正经，其胸怀令伊丽莎白不胜钦佩。柯林斯领大家走遍了花园里的曲径小道，每到一处景物，他就琐琐碎碎讲上一阵，但却只字不提美在何处。客人们只有洗耳恭听的工夫，连句赞赏的话都插不进去。柯林斯能说得出四周有多少田园，最远的树丛里有多少株树。然而，即便他的花园再别致，乡村的风光再秀丽，整个王国的景物再迷人，也比不上天地无双的罗辛斯庄园。那座庄园在柯府的斜对面，四面环树，从树隙中可以望见罗辛斯大厦——一幢漂亮的现代建筑，耸立在一片高地上。

从花园里出来，柯林斯原想领大家到两块草坪上溜溜，怎奈女士们穿的鞋经不起残余的雪霜，于是只好折回房去。柯林斯陪着岳父大人闲逛，而夏洛特引着妹妹及女友在房前屋后参观了起来。也许是由于丈夫不在跟前，她有机会亲口夸耀自己的住房，夏洛特显得十分高兴。房子很小，但结构坚实，非常实用。一切都布置得整整齐齐，安排得井然有序，伊丽莎白把这些都归功于夏洛特。只要能忘掉柯林斯，这儿的里里外外还真有一种祥和安逸的气氛。伊丽莎白从夏洛特喜形于色的样子判断，柯林斯一定是个常被遗忘的人物。

伊丽莎白早就听人说，凯瑟琳夫人还待在乡下。在饭桌旁，大家谈起了此事。柯林斯见缝插针地说：

“伊丽莎白小姐，星期天到教堂去，你就可以荣幸地见到凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人。不用说，你会喜欢上她老人家的。她待人和蔼可亲，一点架子都没有。我敢说，做完礼拜后，她一定会注意到你，那可是你的福分呀。我可以毫不犹豫地告诉你，只要她老人家请我们去做客，定会把你以及我的小姨子玛丽亚也捎带上。我的小夏洛特非常受她的宠爱。我们俩每星期都要到罗辛斯参加两次宴会，而且她老人家从不允许我们步行回家。她总要为我们派一部马车，我应该说派其中的一部马车，因为她有好几部马车呢。”

“凯瑟琳夫人的确是一个非常值得人尊敬，非常有见识的女人，”夏洛特帮着说，“同时，她还是一个最善于体贴人的邻居。”

“一点不错，亲爱的，跟我说的一模一样。这样的夫人，你怎样尊崇她都不为过分。”

晚上，大家在一起时主要议论哈福德郡的新闻，同时把信中已谈过的那些陈谷子烂芝麻又拉出来嚼一遍。人去屋空之后，伊丽莎白在自己的房间里陷入了沉思。她想象着夏洛特对婚后的生活究竟满足到了什么程度，想象着她在用什么样的手腕操纵自己的丈夫，以及她对柯林斯的耐性到底有多大。捉摸了半天，伊丽莎白不得不承认，她的女友把一切都做得天衣无缝、无可挑剔。接下来，她由不得又考虑起了以后的这几天会怎么样度过。据她看来，这儿的生活平淡无奇，既要忍受柯林斯那讨厌的插嘴打岔的毛病，还得与罗辛斯庄园里的人应酬来往。凭着她丰富的想象力，所有的事情都有了结局。

第二天正晌午，她待在自己的房间里，正准备出去散散步，忽闻楼下传来了喧嚷声，好像整个宅院的人都慌乱了起来。她侧耳倾听，听见有人风风火火冲上楼来，咋咋呼呼喊她的名字。于是，她打开房门，在楼梯口遇见了玛丽亚。玛丽亚激动得透不过气来，大声嚷道：

“喂，亲爱的伊丽莎，快到餐厅里来吧，来看看壮观的场面！我暂时不告诉你是怎么回事。快点，马上下楼来。”

伊丽莎白再怎么问都不管用，玛丽亚守口如瓶，就是不肯再朝下讲。于是，两人急步跑下楼，一路奔入面对小路的餐厅，准备大饱眼福，一睹奇观异景。闹了半天原来是到了两位女客。她们乘坐一辆低矮的四轮敞篷马车，在花园门口停了下来。

“就是这么个壮观场面呀？”伊丽莎白嚷道，“我还以为花园里闯进了猪呢，却原是凯瑟琳夫人和她的千金大驾光临啦！”

“哎呀，亲爱的，”玛丽亚见她认错了人，不由十分诧异，“那位老太太不是凯瑟琳夫人，而是和她们住在一起的詹金森太太。另外一个是德布尔小姐。你瞧瞧她，多么小巧玲珑。谁想得到，她会这么瘦小！”

“她太没有人情味了，风这么大，却让夏洛特待在门外。她为什么不进来呢？”

“嗨，夏洛特说，她难得进来坐坐。要让德布尔小姐进来，那真是天大的面子。”

“她的眉眼倒还叫人看了喜欢。”伊丽莎白嘴里这么说着，心中却又生出了别的念头。“她看上去体弱多病，脾气也不好。是呀，和他[1]相配真是再好不过了。可以给他做一个贤妻良母哟。”

柯林斯夫妇双双侍立在门外，陪着贵宾说话。伊丽莎白觉得可笑的是，威廉爵士木雕泥塑般在门道处侍候，虔诚地望着眼前的贵人。德布尔小姐每朝他这边望一眼，他总要鞠一个躬。

他们的谈话终于结束了。两位女宾驱车走了，而其他的人回到了屋里。柯林斯一看到伊丽莎白和玛丽亚，就恭贺她们遇到了大喜。夏洛特解释了丈夫的话，说罗辛斯庄园明日请他们一道去吃饭。

第二十九章


柯林斯收到邀请后，得意到了极点。他梦寐以求的就是能向好奇的客人们炫耀一下他那女恩主的恢宏气派，让客人瞧瞧凯瑟琳夫人待他们两口子是多么和气亲切。谁料想，机会这么快就从天而降了。这充分说明凯瑟琳夫人具有届高就下、屈尊降贵的姿态，真不知叫他怎么敬佩才为合适。

“应该承认，”他说，“夫人请咱们大家到罗辛斯喝茶吃饭，共度良宵，一点也不使我感到意外。她对人一贯亲切友好，我早就料到她会这么做。可是，谁能想到她竟然会如此盛情好客呢？谁又能想象得来，你们刚刚来到，就被请去吃饭，而且全都受到了邀请，无一遗漏！”

“我觉得这类事情一点也不奇怪，”威廉爵士说，“我处在这样的地位，最了解大人物的为人处世。在宫廷里，这类儒雅好客的事并不罕见。”

这一整天，以及第二天的上午，大家张口闭口只谈到罗辛斯赴宴的事。柯林斯仔仔细细交代了一番，告诉他们将会看到些什么，免得他们见到那些华丽的厅堂、成群的奴仆以及丰盛的晚宴后，会吓得不知所措。

当女士们分头去梳妆打扮时，他对伊丽莎白说：

“不必为你的衣着操心，亲爱的表妹。凯瑟琳夫人绝不会要求咱们穿华贵的服装，因为只有她和她的女儿才配穿那样的衣服。依我看，你的衣服比其他人稍微强些就行了，不必刻意追求。凯瑟琳夫人绝不会因为你衣着朴素而瞧不起你。她愿意让所有的人都尊卑分明，很注意身份上的不同。”

太太小姐们梳妆打扮时，他又到各人的房门口催了两三次，要她们把动作放快些。他说，凯瑟琳夫人在吃饭时，最讨厌客人姗姗来迟。玛丽亚·卢卡斯对交际场上的礼节不大在行，一听说夫人的生活习惯这么可怕，吓得她胆战心惊。她怀着诚惶诚恐的心情期待着去罗辛斯见那位贵夫人，活似她父亲当年入官觐见国王。

趁着天晴日丽，大家高高兴兴地穿过庄园，走了大约半英里的路程。每一座庄园都有其美妙的景致，这一座当然也不例外。伊丽莎白看得心旷神怡，情绪特别高涨，但还没有达到柯林斯所期望的那样如醉如痴、销魂夺魄的程度。这时的柯林斯正向众人讲述着罗辛斯大厦正面的那些窗户，说光那些玻璃当初就耗费了刘易斯·德布尔一大笔钱。伊丽莎白听后，并不觉得有什么感触。

登上门厅前的台阶时，玛丽亚越来越惶恐不安，就连威廉爵士也显得有些慌乱。只有伊丽莎白阵脚不乱，表现得毫无惧色。她没听说凯瑟琳夫人在德才上有什么出类拔萃、令人敬畏的地方，光凭有钱有势，还不至于叫她见了就惊慌失措。

步入门厅时，柯林斯兴高采烈、指手画脚地讲解起来，夸这儿陈设考究、气势宏大。随后，他们跟在仆人的身后，穿过前厅走进了一个房间里。凯瑟琳夫人母女和詹金森太太正坐在那里等候。夫人竟然不顾自己高贵的身份，站起来迎接客人。柯林斯太太事先已和丈夫商量妥当，由她出面替宾主作介绍。这件事她做得十分体面得当，把丈夫觉得必不可少的那些道歉话和感谢话都一概免了。

威廉爵士虽说进过王宫，但是看到周围如此富丽堂皇，他不由肃然起敬。于惊恐之中，他深深行了个大礼，然后便一言不发地落了座。他的女儿差点没把魂吓掉，坐在椅子边上，目光不知放到何处才好。伊丽莎白却安之若素，从容不迫地打量起面前的这三位女士。只见凯瑟琳夫人身材高大、五官分明，年轻时也许是个漂亮人。她的神情和举止都显得盛气凌人，似乎在提醒客人不要忘记他们卑微的身份。她沉默的时候，倒不怎么可怕，但是一说起话来，总是带着一种威严的口吻，表明了她的自命不凡，使伊丽莎白不由想起了威克姆的话。经过一天的观察，她觉得凯瑟琳夫人跟威克姆先生所形容的毫无二致。

细看了这位夫人，伊丽莎白立即发现她的容貌举止跟达西先生有几分相像。随后，伊丽莎白把目光转向她的女儿，觉得她过于娇小和瘦弱，几乎使她像玛丽亚一样感到惊奇。母女俩无论是身材还是面容，无一相似之处。德布尔小姐脸色苍白，看起来体弱多病，长相虽不算丑陋，但也不出众。她寡言少语，只是偶尔和詹金森太太低声嘀咕上几句。每遇到这种情况，貌不惊人的詹金森太太总要拿出全副精力用心听她讲话，而且像一道屏风一样挡在她面前，把她遮得严严实实。

坐了一小会儿，客人们全被唤到窗口欣赏风景。柯林斯陪着大家，一处处地指给他们看。凯瑟琳夫人慈祥地告诉众人，夏天的景色还要美丽得多呢。

酒席极其丰盛。柯林斯来前曾说过，夫人家奴仆成群，金银餐具不计其数，现在一看果然名不虚传。他的另一项预言也得到了应验，只见他真的秉承了夫人的旨意，坐到了末席上。瞧他那副神气，就好像人生再没有比这更荣耀的事情了。他用刀子切着肉，大口地吃着，一边美滋滋地夸个没完。他和威廉爵士一唱一和，对每一道菜都要说上一大堆好听的话。威廉爵士已经不那么拘谨了，一下子成了女婿的应声虫。伊丽莎白心中纳闷，不知道凯瑟琳夫人怎么容忍他的那副丑态。可是，夫人似乎对他们言过其实的夸赞十分满意。尤其是当他们为一道难得一见的菜大唱颂歌时，夫人便越发笑容可掬了。席间，其他的人没有多少话可说。只要有机会，伊丽莎白倒愿意和人聊聊天，可惜她被夹在夏洛特和德布尔小姐之间——前者全神贯注聆听凯瑟琳夫人的真知灼见，而后者自始至终没跟她说过一句话。詹金森太太把主要的精力都放在观察德布尔小姐吃饭上，不时地劝她吃这吃那，生怕委屈了她的胃口。玛丽亚由于怯阵，一句话都讲不出来，而那两位男宾只顾大吃大喝以及说些夸奖的话。

女士们回到客厅，别的什么都不干，只是听凯瑟琳夫人发表宏论高谈。夫人无论谈到任何事情，语气都是那样斩钉截铁、不容置喙，让人看得出，她的观点就是结论。就这样，她滔滔不绝地一直讲到咖啡端上来为止。在闲聊时，她仔细问起了夏洛特的家务事，并且就如何持家，向她作了一大堆指示。她告诉夏洛特，像他们那样一个小产人家，必须要学会精打细算，还指教夏洛特怎样饲养母牛和家禽。伊丽莎白发现，这位贵夫人事无巨细都要过问，并且要抓住时机向别人发号施令。在与柯林斯夫人交谈之中，凯瑟琳夫人抽空向玛丽亚和伊丽莎白提了许多问题。尤其是对伊丽莎白，她更是问这问那，因为她对伊丽莎白家里的情况一无所知。她告诉柯林斯夫人说，伊丽莎白文静典雅，是个挺不错的姑娘。她先后问起伊丽莎白有几个姐妹，比她大的有几个以及比她小的有几个，还问她们姐妹中有没有待嫁的，人长得漂亮不漂亮，在哪儿上的学。另外，她还问伊丽莎白的父亲用什么样的马车，母亲的娘家姓什么。伊丽莎白觉得她问得太唐突，不过还是心平气和地一一回答了她。最后，凯瑟琳夫人这样说道：

“听说，你父亲的财产将由柯林斯先生继承。”她边说边把头扭向夏洛特，“这对你们两口子有好处，所以我感到高兴。要是换上别人，我就会认为，家族里的女性也有权继承财产。刘易斯·德布尔家就提倡这样做。贝内特小姐，你会弹琴和唱歌吗？”

“会一点。”

“哦！那好呀——什么时候我们倒很想听听。我们家的琴质量好，可能强于……嗨，哪天你还是弹弹再说吧。你的姐姐妹妹都会弹唱吗？”

“有一个会。”

“为什么不都学学呢？你们都应该具有这方面的修养。韦布家的老头子收入不及你的父亲，可他们家的小姐都会弹琴……另外，你们会画画吗？”

“不会，对此一窍不通。”

“什么，你们难道不会画？”

“是的。”

“真是咄咄怪事。我想你们大概是没有机会。你们的母亲每逢开春的时候，应该带你们进城拜师学艺。”

“母亲那方面倒没有什么阻力，可是父亲却讨厌伦敦。”

“你们的家庭女教师现在还教你们吗？”

“我们从来就没请过家庭教师。”

“天哪，没请过家庭教师！这怎么可能呢？家里出了五朵金花，咋会连个教师都不肯请！真是闻所未闻呀！那么，你的母亲就得自己辛苦些，手把手地教你们喽。”

伊丽莎白不禁笑了，告诉她事实并非如此。

“那么，由谁教你们学习呢？由谁管束你们呢？没请家庭教师，不就把你们耽误了吗？”

“和有些人家相比，我们的确缺乏好的学习条件。不过，你只要勤奋好学，就不会在乎条件的优劣。家里非常鼓励我们学习，该请的老师也都请了，当然，姐妹中也有不愿学的，那就只好随她们的便了。”

“说得一点不差。不过，聘请家庭教师就是为了杜绝这类荒废学业的现象。我要是认识你母亲，说什么我也得劝她请名家教。我一贯认为，离开系统的正规教育，一个人在学业上会一事无成，而这种教育只有家庭教师才能胜任。说起来真有意思，许多人家的教师都是我一手帮忙找的。我总希望能让每一个年轻人都得到好的差事。詹金森太太的四个侄女就是经我介绍，谋到了称心如意的工作。前几天，有人只是在我面前偶然提到了一位年轻姑娘，而我却把她引荐给了一户人家。据说，那家人对她十分满意。昨天梅特卡夫夫人还登门感谢我呢，说波普小姐是个难得的好教师。她是这样对我说的：‘凯瑟琳夫人，谢谢您为我们推荐了一个人才。’柯林斯夫人，这件事我向你提过吧？……贝内特小姐，你的妹妹有没有进入社交界的？”

“有，夫人。她们全都开始交际了。”

“荒唐！哪能五个姐妹一块出来搞交际呢？……真是稀罕事！……你不过排行第二呀。小妹妹哪能在姐姐出嫁前涉足社交场呢！……我是说，你的妹妹还小得很吧？”

“是的，最小的一个不满十六岁。也许她还太小，不宜多交际。不过，夫人，如果由于姐姐嫁不出去，或者不愿意出嫁，做妹妹的就不能交际、不能娱乐，我想这可就太委屈她们了。小妹和大姐都同样有权享受青春的乐趣。怎么能因为出生的先后不同就把妹妹锁在家中呢！我认为，这样做很可能会破坏姐妹之情，也不利于培养高尚的情操。”

“嗬，想不到你小小的人儿，说出的话却一句顶一句，”夫人说道，“请问，今年你芳龄几何？”

“我的三个妹妹均已长大成人，”伊丽莎白笑了笑说，“夫人您总不至于要我招出自己的年龄吧。”

凯瑟琳夫人没料到她竟会对自己的问题避而不答，不由大吃一惊。伊丽莎白心里暗忖，敢于公开蔑视这样一位显赫无礼的贵妇人，她恐怕要算第一个人！

“你肯定不超过二十岁，所以你没必要隐瞒。”

“我不足二十一岁。”

男宾们围了过来，大家在一起喝过茶后，就摆上了牌桌。凯瑟琳夫人、威廉爵士以及柯林斯夫妇坐在一起打四十张。而德布尔小姐却想玩“卡西诺”牌戏，于是伊丽莎白和玛丽亚便帮助詹金斯太太，替她凑了个人数。她们这一桌牌，玩得真是乏味到了极点。除了詹金斯太太有些为德布尔小姐担心，问些冷暖以及灯光强弱方面的问题，再没有人说一句与打牌无关的话。另外的一桌可就热闹多啦，一般都是凯瑟琳夫人在讲话——时而指出三位牌友的失误，时而唠叨几句她自己的趣闻轶事。她老人家不管说什么，柯林斯都要随声附和。柯林斯每赢一次，都要把夫人感谢一遍；如果觉得赢得太多了，还要向夫人表示道歉。威廉爵士说话不多，只顾把一桩桩轶事和一个个贵人的名字存入记忆之中。

等到凯瑟琳夫人母女俩玩厌了，不想再打牌了的时候，众人便撤了牌局。主家向柯林斯太太提出，要派马车送他们回府。夏洛特千恩万谢地接受了对方的好意。于是，主人吩咐立即备车。走前，大家围在火炉旁，聆听凯瑟琳夫人对明日的天气进行预测。等到马车一来，招呼客人登车，凯瑟琳夫人的指教才算告一段落。辞别时，柯林斯说了足有几大筐感激的话，而威廉爵士鞠躬鞠了一个又一个。马车出了庄园的大门，柯林斯便要求伊丽莎白谈谈她在罗辛斯的观后感。为了照顾夏洛特的面子，伊丽莎白说了几句言过其实的恭维话。她的话按说是费了心思的，然而却丝毫不能让柯林斯满意。在无可奈何的情况下，柯林斯只好亲自赞扬起了凯瑟琳夫人的美德。





第三十章


威廉爵士在亨斯福德只逗留了一个星期，但就在这短短的一段时间里，他了解到自己的女儿已寻觅到了称心如意的归宿，嫁了一个不可多得的丈夫，并且遇上了个难能可贵的邻居。在他做客期间，柯林斯每天上午都要赶着双轮马车带他出去兜风，让他欣赏乡间的景色。他一走，柯林斯家里又恢复了按部就班的日常生活。伊丽莎白庆幸地发现，威廉爵士离开后，她还是不常见表兄的面。从早餐到晚餐这段时间里，柯林斯不是收拾花园，就是在书房里读读写写，要不就凭窗眺望书房外的小道。而女士们的起居室就在背后。伊丽莎白起初很纳闷：现在的餐厅比较宽敞，位置也比较好，夏洛特怎么不把它用做起居室？但她很快就发现，她的女友之所以这样安排，倒有个充足的理由：假如女士们待在一间舒适的起居室里，柯林斯在自己房间里的时间势必要少得多。因此，她很赞赏夏洛特巧妙的心计。

她们从客厅里一点也看不见大路上的情况。多亏了柯林斯先生，每逢有什么车辆路过，他总要跑来汇报一声。德布尔小姐几乎天天乘着四轮敞篷马车驶过，而柯林斯一次不落地跑来告诉她们。德布尔小姐常常把车停在柯府门前，跟夏洛特说上几分钟的闲话，但很难请她下车进来坐坐。

柯林斯差不多每天都要往罗辛斯走一趟，他妻子也要隔三差五地到庄园里看看。伊丽莎白不由想到，兴许还有别的教士职位要馈赠，否则她真不明白，柯林斯两口子牺牲那么多时间究竟图个什么。有时候，凯瑟琳夫人也到他们府上来。只要她老人家一驾到，柯府的一切都逃不过她的眼睛。她常常要查问他们的日常生活，检查他们的家务活，并提些改进的意见。有时，她指责屋里的家具摆得不合理，甚至还批评偷懒耍滑的女用人。如果她肯在这里吃些东西，好像全是为了查清柯林斯夫人过日子是否大手大脚。

伊丽莎白不久便发觉，这位贵妇人虽然并不负责当地的治安，可是她在自己的教区里却俨然是一位最活跃的法官，芝麻大的事都要由柯林斯禀报给她。只要哪个村民爱吵架、好发牢骚，或是穷得闹事，她便亲自跑到村里，去调解纠纷、平息怨恨，骂得他们一个个服服帖帖、相安无事。

每星期，他们大约要应邀到罗辛斯吃两回饭。由于缺了个威廉爵士，晚上只能摆一桌牌。这样的娱乐千篇一律，全都是第一次的重演。他们很少到别处做客，因为附近一般人家的生活派头，柯林斯夫妇还高攀不上。不过，这对伊丽莎白倒不是坏事。总的来说，她在柯府日子过得还算舒适：每天，她可以愉快地和夏洛特交谈上半个小时；另外，近来的天气特别好，她经常出去游玩撒欢。别人去拜谒凯瑟琳夫人时，她总爱到庄园旁边的小树林里散步。那里有一条幽静的绿阴小径，在其他人眼里算不了什么，而在她看来却是那般奇妙。在这里，她觉得自己可以摆脱好奇心十足的凯瑟琳夫人的纠缠。

头两个星期就这样平平静静地过去了。复活节在一天天接近，节前的那几天，罗辛斯府上要添一位新客人。在这么个弹丸之地，这件事就显得非常重要了，伊丽莎白刚来不久就听人讲，达西先生在近几周里要光顾此地。在她认识的人当中，虽然没有几个像达西这么令她反感的，但他的到来可以给罗辛斯的聚会增加些新气氛。她可以幸灾乐祸地观察到他对表妹的态度，从中看出宾利小姐在他身上完全是枉费了一番心机。凯瑟琳夫人显然已把他看成了自己未来的女婿，因此在报告他要来的消息时，简直有些眉飞色舞。她对达西先生赞不绝口，可是一听说卢卡斯小姐和伊丽莎白以前常跟他见面，便差点发起火来。

达西先生刚来，柯府的人便知道了。原来，为了能够尽早获得确切消息，柯林斯在亨斯福德大路门的林间小屋旁转悠了整整一个上午。等到马车驶进庄园时，他向贵宾行了个礼，然后匆忙跑回家报告这一重大新闻。第二天早晨，他又急忙赶到罗辛斯庄园去问安。达西先生把他某个爵士叔叔的幼子菲茨威廉上校也带了来。这样，柯林斯得向凯瑟琳夫人的两个外甥同时致意。令柯府的人感到十分意外的是，他回家时，两位贵宾也跟了来，夏洛特从丈夫的房间看到他们一行穿过了马路，便立即跑进另一个房间里，告诉小姐们有贵宾驾到。她最后又补充说：

“这份荣誉得归功于你，伊丽莎。达西先生顾不上舟车劳顿，赶到这里来，绝不是拜访我来着。”

伊丽莎白听到这一席恭维话，还没来得及推辞，就有人摇响了门铃，通报贵宾驾到。不一会儿，三位先生走进屋来。带头的是菲茨威廉上校，他三十岁光景的年纪，长得算不上英俊潇洒，但从仪表和谈吐上看，是个地地道道的绅士。达西先生一点没变，还是在哈福德郡时的老样子，带着惯常的矜持态度，向柯林斯太太问好。不管他对伊丽莎白怀着什么样的感情，他跟她相遇时，却是那样不动声色，一本正经。伊丽莎白只是对他行了个屈膝礼，一句话也没说。

菲茨威廉立刻跟大家攀谈起来，口齿伶俐，风度优雅大方，神情轻松自在。可他的那表弟，只和柯林斯太太轻描淡写地谈了几句有关住房及花园的话，下来就谁也不理了。最后，他终于想起了礼貌问题，于是便向伊丽莎白询问起她全家人的健康情况。伊丽莎白一如既往，照常敷衍了他几句。停了片刻，她又说道：

“我姐姐这三个月一直待在城里。你难道从未见过她？”

其实，她完全清楚他没见过简。不过，她想探探虚实，看他知道不知道宾利兄妹和简之间发生的不愉快。达西回答说，他的运气太差，没有见到贝内特小姐。伊丽莎白觉得他在说这话时，神色有些慌张，于是她就没有再朝下追问。没过多久，两位客人便告辞走掉了。





第三十一章


菲茨威廉上校的言谈举止温文尔雅，在柯府受到众人的交口称赞。女士们都认为，他定会为罗辛斯庄园的聚会平添不少情趣。只可惜她们已有多日没接到那边的邀请了，因为庄园里来了客人，用不着她们陪伴了。一直到复活节那天，也就是达西表兄弟到达近一星期之后，他们才荣幸地受到了一次邀请。就连这次，也只不过邀请他们在离开教堂时，晚上顺便到庄园里玩玩。在这一个星期的时间里，他们几乎没有见过凯瑟琳夫人母女。在此期间，菲茨威廉上校倒是来柯府拜谒过几次。至于那位达西先生，他们只是在教堂里见过一面。

柯家的人欣然接受了罗辛斯方面的邀请，选了个适当的时间来到了凯瑟琳夫人的客厅里参加聚会。夫人客客气气接待了他们，但可以看得出来，她的态度大不如以前她找不到人为她解闷时那般热情。实际上，她几乎只想着自己的两个外甥，光顾跟他们谈话，特别是跟达西先生谈话，而很少答理屋内的其他人。

菲茨威廉上校见到他们，似乎由衷地感到高兴。罗辛斯的日子过得太单调，任何新鲜事都令他觉得振奋。更何况他已喜欢上了柯林斯太太的那个漂亮的女伴。眼下他就坐在她身边，绘声绘色地给她讲肯特郡及哈福德郡的情况，并对旅行和家居、新书和音乐发表见解。伊丽莎白听得津津有味，觉得她在这间大厅里以前所得到的最大的乐趣还不如现在的一半。他们俩谈天说地、口若悬河，不觉引起了凯瑟琳夫人和达西先生的注意。达西立刻露出了好奇的神色，不时拿眼睛瞅他们。夫人也觉得好奇，而且表现得更为露骨，过了一会儿就听她毫无顾忌地嚷嚷道：

“你们在谈什么，菲茨威廉？我是说你们议论的是什么事情？你在对贝内特小姐讲什么？能让我听听吗？”

“我们在谈音乐，姨妈。”菲茨威廉迫不得已地回答说。

“在谈音乐！那你们把声音提高些，因为我非常喜欢这个话题。我敢说，在全英国，像我这样真正热爱音乐并且具有较高鉴赏力的人，是屈指可数的。我当初要是学了音乐，就一定能成为一个伟大的专家。安妮是因为身体不好，不能勤学苦练，不然也可以在音乐方面有较深的造诣。我相信，要是条件允许，她的演奏定会轰动一时。达西，乔治亚娜的琴弹得怎么样了？”

达西先生满怀深情地把妹妹弹琴的本事夸赞了一通。

“听你说她这么有出息，我感到十分高兴，”凯瑟琳夫人说，“请你代我转告她，如不刻苦练习，就休想出人头地。”

“姨妈，请您放心，”达西说，“她用不着别人鼓励，因为她一直都在坚持不懈地练琴。”

“这样就好。多练练总没有坏处。下次我给她写信，一定要告诉她，无论如何都不能有懈怠之心。我常对年轻小姐们说，手脚不勤快，就休想把琴练到炉火纯青的地步。我对贝内特小姐讲过几次，除非多练习，否则她绝不能把琴真正地弹好。柯林斯太太没有钢琴，我却常对她说，欢迎她天天来罗辛斯，就用詹金森太太房间里的那架琴练习。你知道，她在那间屋子练琴，不会碍别人的事。”

达西先生见她出言不逊，为她感到难为情，于是便没有答她的茬。

喝过咖啡之后，菲茨威廉上校提醒伊丽莎白，说她曾答应过要为他弹首曲子。伊丽莎白一听，便非常痛快地在钢琴旁坐了下来。上校拖过一把椅子，坐到了她身旁。凯瑟琳夫人听了半个曲子，就又去找另外的一个外甥说话。后来，那个外甥从她身边走开，款步来到钢琴前，选了个位置立定，恰好能把演奏者那漂亮的面孔看得一清二楚。伊丽莎白把他的一举一动都瞧在眼里，于是便利用间歇的时间，狡黠地冲他笑了笑说：

“达西先生，这么虎视眈眈地听我弹琴，该不是想吓唬我吧？你的妹妹虽说琴术精湛，但是这吓我不倒。我生来就是这么个倔强脾气，在别人的恐吓下绝不惊慌失措。谁越是威吓我，我的胆量反而越大。”

“我不想说你讲错了话，”达西答道，“因为你不会当真认为我存心吓唬你。我有幸认识了你这么久，知道你爱说些言不由衷的话。”

伊丽莎白听他这么形容她，不由开心地笑了起来。她对菲茨威廉上校说：

“你表弟把我刻画得惟妙惟肖，这是让你别把我的话当真。我实在不走运，原想在这儿招摇撞骗，谁料竟碰上了个揭老底的人。达西先生，你也太尖刻了，怎么把我在哈福德郡的短处，尽你所知，全都端了出来。不过，你这样做也不高明，因为要是把我惹恼了，我会进行报复，说出的事情准会让你的亲戚大吃一惊。”

“我才不怕你呢。”达西微笑着说。

“把他的短处往出抖抖，我很想知道，”菲茨威廉爵士高声叫嚷道，“我倒要听听，他在生人面前是个什么德性。”

“那我就说给你听听。不过，你可要做好思想准备，因为他的行径十分可怕。你要知道，我第一次在哈福德郡见到他，是在一次舞会上……你猜猜，他在舞会上的表现怎么样？他总共只跳了四曲舞！我不愿惹你难过，可事实的确如此。当时男宾缺得厉害，有好几位小姐都因为没有舞伴，而在一旁坐冷板凳。达西先生，这一铁的事实你是无法抵赖的。”

“当时，除了和我同去的几位女士，其他的小姐我连一个也不认识。”

“不错。可是，到了舞会上，绝不能等着别人为你介绍舞伴。好啦，菲茨威廉上校，下来弹什么曲子？我的手指在恭候你的吩咐呢。”

“如果当时我自己寻舞伴，就不至于落下这么坏的印象，”达西说，“只可惜我拙嘴笨舌，不善于向生人作自我介绍。”

这时的伊丽莎白仍在冲着菲茨威廉上校说话：“要不要问问你的表弟，这到底是什么缘故？问问他，为什么一个见多识广、知书达理的人竟不善于向陌生人作自我介绍呢？”

“不用问他了，还是由我回答你的问题吧，”菲茨威廉说，“那是因为他害怕麻烦。”

“我确实不如某些人那样有本事，遇到素不相识的人也能谈笑自若，”达西分辩道，“我听不懂别人谈话时的弦外之音，也装不出对别人的事情感兴趣的样子。”

“我弹起琴来，”伊丽莎白说，“手指不像我所见到的许多妇女那样熟练，不像她们那样灵巧、有力，也不如她们弹得那样妙趣横生。不过，我总觉得这都是由于我自己的过错而造成的，都怪我练习得不够。我并不觉得我的手指低人一等，比不上那些比我弹得好的人。”

达西笑了笑说：“你说得完全正确。不过，你练琴的效果还是挺不错的。凡是能够荣幸地听你弹奏的人，都挑不出你的毛病来。咱们俩是一类人，都不愿在生人面前卖弄自己。”

这时，凯瑟琳夫人打断了他们的谈话，大声询问他们在说什么悄悄话。伊丽莎白没做声，立刻又埋下头继续弹琴了。凯瑟琳夫人走过来听了一会儿，然后对达西说：

“贝内特小姐若是再多练练，同时请伦敦的名师点教一下，弹出的曲子就不会有欠缺之处了。她的指法相当熟练，但在悟性方面不如安妮。安妮要是身体好，能多练练的话，一定能成为顶呱呱的钢琴演奏家。”

伊丽莎白瞧了瞧达西，想着他是否真心同意这般抬举他的表妹。但她一无所获，不管是这一次还是在以前，她都看不出达西对他的表妹有任何钟情的迹象。这么一比较，她觉得达西爱的是宾利小姐。如果宾利小姐和他是亲戚，他很可能娶她为妻。

凯瑟琳夫人在一旁不住地对伊丽莎白的演奏说长道短，间或还针对技法及欣赏发表了许多高论。伊丽莎白出于礼貌，只好坐在那儿忍气吞声地听着。应诸位先生的请求，她又继续弹奏，一直弹到夫人叫人备好马车送他们回去为止。





第三十二章


第二天上午，柯林斯太太和玛丽亚有事到村子里去了，伊丽莎白独自一人坐在房里给简写信。突然，外边有人摇门铃，吓了她一大跳。一定是有客人来啦！由于没听到马车的声音，所以来人有可能是凯瑟琳夫人。伊丽莎白慌了手脚，急忙把写了半截的信藏起来，免得让夫人瞧见后问这问那。房门打开后，她不由吃了一惊，因为进来的是达西先生，而且只有他一个人。

达西见她独自一个在家，似乎也吃了一惊，于是连忙为自己的冒昧道歉不止。他说，他原以为太太小姐们全在家里，所以才敢贸然来访。

两人坐了下来。伊丽莎白问了几句有关罗辛斯庄园的情况后，双方都觉得无话可说，大有陷入僵局的危险。因此，必须扯出个话头来。正在这紧急时刻，她突然想起了和他最后一次在哈福德郡见面时的情况，顿时起了好奇心，很想知道他将如何解释那次的匆匆离别，于是说道：

“达西先生，你们去年十一月份离开尼瑟费德时，一个个走得真是太突然了！宾利先生前脚走，你们后脚便跟了去，一定让他感到十分意外。如果我没记错的话，你们出发的日期中间仅一天之隔。你离开伦敦前，还见他们兄妹了吧？但愿他们都还身体健康。”

“他们都很好，多亏你还惦记着他们。”

伊丽莎白见他再没有下文了，又稍微等了一会儿，然后说道：

“依我看，宾利先生不太情愿重返尼瑟费德了吧？”

“没听他这么说过。不过，他绝对不会常到那里去，因为他有许多的朋友需要应酬。他现在正是风华正茂之际，朋友遍布天下，交际事务一天多似一天。”

“如果他不打算在尼瑟费德长住，最好把那别墅彻底放弃。这样于街坊四邻都有好处，因为大家将来很可能会有一个固定的人家做邻居。不过，宾利先生当初租下那别墅是图自己方便，而不是为了照顾街坊邻居的利益。所以，他现在无论是保留还是退掉尼瑟费德，还会按他自己的准则行事。”

“据我分析，”达西说，“他一旦买到合适的房子，就一定会放弃那个地方。”

伊丽莎白不愿意再谈论他的那个朋友，于是便没有接他的话。既然没有别的事情可谈，她决定让达西也动动脑筋，由他寻找一个话题。

达西心领神会，没过多长时间便说道：“这幢房子好像十分舒适。我想，柯林斯先生初来亨斯福德时，凯瑟琳夫人一定把这房子好好修了修。”

“我想是的……而且我相信她的好心没有白费，因为天底下没有一个人比柯林斯先生更知恩图报。”

“柯林斯先生看样子挺有福气，娶了这样一位太太。”

“是的，他的确洪福齐天。他的朋友真应该为他感到高兴，难得这样一个聪明女人愿意嫁给他，嫁进门后又使他过上了如此幸福的日子。虽然我不敢肯定，我的女友嫁给柯林斯先生是她最明智的抉择，但她之所以这样做，是有其微妙原因的。她好像幸福到了极点。如果仔细地思考一下，就会发现这对她的确是一门良缘。”

“距离娘家和朋友们这么近，她一定觉得很称心。”

“你还说近呢，算起来都快五十英里了。”

“只要路好走，五十英里算得了什么？只不过半天的路程。所以，我才说她离娘家很近。”

“我认为，不能把距离的远近当做优点来衡量这门亲事。”伊丽莎白嚷了起来，“再者，我绝不承认，柯林斯夫人的归宿离娘家很近。”

“这正说明了你对哈福德郡的依依难舍之情。我想，你只要走出浪搏恩一步，也会嫌远。”

达西说这话时，脸上挂着一丝微笑，一丝伊丽莎白自以为能看得透的微笑。看来，他一定认为她此时此刻想起了简和尼瑟费德。于是，她红着脸说：

“我并不是说，女人家就不兴嫁得离娘家不太近。远近是相对的，取决于许多不同的因素。如果手中有钱，不在乎路费，远一点也无妨。可是，这一家子的情况就不同了。柯林斯夫妇的收入相当可观，但钱还没有多到可以经常出门旅行的地步。我相信，即便把这段路程缩短一半多，我的女友也不会自称离娘家近。”

达西先生把椅子朝她跟前移了移，说道：“你可不能乡土观念太重，因为你总不会在浪搏恩待一辈子吧。”

伊丽莎白一听，露出了诧异的神色。达西见状，情绪低落了下来。他把椅子朝后拉了拉，顺手从桌子上拿了张报纸，随意溜了一眼，然后以一种较为冷静的声音说：

“你喜欢肯特郡吗？”

于是，两人以此为话题交谈了几句，彼此神情镇定，言词简洁。后来，夏洛特和她的妹妹散步归来，他们立即中止了谈话。那姐妹俩以为他们在秘密交谈，不由感到十分惊奇。达西先生把刚才误闯柯府、巧遇贝内特小姐的情况向她们解释了一遍。下来，他又坐了一会儿，和众人没说上几句话，就告辞走了。

“这说明了什么？”他刚一走出门，夏洛特这边就嚷道，“亲爱的伊丽莎白，他八成是爱上你了，不然他绝不会随便来这儿走动。”

伊丽莎白把他刚才闷声不响的情形讲了讲，夏洛特又觉得自己纵有满腔的好意，看上去却不大像是这么回事。她们七猜八想，最后只能这样认为：他是因为闲得无聊，才到这儿来散心的。在眼下的季节，这种可能性比较大。一切野外活动都已宣告结束。家里虽有凯瑟琳夫人陪着说话，还可以读读书、打打台球，但作为男人家，总不能老待在屋里。既然柯府近在咫尺，走路到那里去又十分有情趣，另外，那儿的小姐太太热情好客，所以，两位表兄弟在以后的这段时期里几乎天天往那儿跑。他们总是在上午的某个时间去，有时孤单单一个人去，有时两人结伴同往，间或还由姨妈陪着走走。几位女士都看得出来，菲茨威廉上校勤来勤往，是因为喜欢和她们相处，因而，她们对他也就越发推崇备至。伊丽莎白喜欢和他待在一起，而他也明显地爱慕着伊丽莎白，这双重因素使伊丽莎白想起了她昔日的意中人乔治·威克姆。将这两人加以比较，她发现菲茨威廉上校的举止不如威克姆那般温柔迷人，然而她相信，他的思想却无比充实。

可是，达西先生为什么要一趟趟往柯府跑呢？这可是个让人猜不透的谜。他绝不是来聊天的，因为他常常坐在那儿，十几分钟也不开口说上一句话。即便他讲了话，似乎也是迫不得已，而决非心甘情愿——那是为了顾及礼貌作出的牺牲，对他本人无半点欢乐可言。他很少有兴高采烈的时候。柯林斯太太简直弄不清他的葫芦里装的是什么药。菲茨威廉上校时常笑他呆头呆脑，可能他平时也是如此。柯林斯太太觉得就凭着她对达西一星半点的了解，猜不出他平时是个什么样子。她衷心希望，达西之所以半痴半呆，是因为他坠入了情网，而他爱恋的对象就是她的朋友伊丽莎。于是，她多留了个心眼，打算把事情查个水落石出。他们到罗辛斯庄园，或者达西来亨斯福德时，她总是注意观察他的言行举止，所收到的效果却不显著。达西的确常把目光移向她的女友，但那目光究竟意味着什么却有很大的学问。那目光诚恳和专注，不过，柯林斯太太觉得里面包含的爱恋成分不多。有时候，那目光只是心不在焉的标志。

她曾经向伊丽莎白提示过一两次，说达西很可能钟情于她，可伊丽莎白总是付之一笑。她认为不应该在这个问题上逼得太紧，免得把伊丽莎白撩逗得动了心，到头来却让她大失所望。依她看来，伊丽莎白只要觉得能把达西控制在手中，对他的厌恶感便会烟消云散，这是毫无疑问的。

她好心好意为伊丽莎白勾画着蓝图，有时还计划让她嫁给菲茨威廉上校。他非常和蔼，极端讨人喜欢，同时也倾心于伊丽莎白。另外，他的社会地位也是无可挑剔的。不过，达西先生在教会里拥有很大的势力，而他的表兄在教会却无任何根基，这样一来，就把当表兄的全部优点都给抵消了。





第三十三章


伊丽莎白在庄园里散步时，曾几次意外地碰见了达西。她觉得自己倒霉透顶，别的人倒是看不到，却偏偏遇见这个人。为了防止此类现象再发生，她在第一次见面时就暗示他说，这儿是她常来溜达的地方。她心想，这样的事情绝不会再发生第二次，不然那才怪呢！然而，事情确实又发生了，甚至还有了第三次。看来，他像是有意跟她过不去，或者主动来赔不是，因为这几次他不光是客套几句，尴尬地沉默一会儿就走开，而是觉得必须掉过头来，陪她走上一段路程。他从来不多说话，伊丽莎白也懒得多讲，懒得多听。可是在第三次相遇时，他问了几个稀奇古怪、互不相关的问题。他问她住在亨斯福德快活不快活，问她为什么喜欢孤单单一个人散步，又问起她是否觉得柯林斯夫妇很幸福。在谈到罗辛斯庄园时，伊丽莎白说她不太了解那家人，而达西却似乎希望她下次来肯特郡，能住进庄园里去。他的话中有话，好像对她有意思。难道他在为菲茨威廉上校着想不成？她暗忖，如果他当真话里有音，那一定是暗示那个人对她有些动心。这事使她有些苦恼，好在他们已经走到了柯府对面的栅栏门口，到了该分手的时候。

有一天，她一边散步，一边聚精会神地重读简上一次的来信，把简心灰意冷时写下的几个段落仔细咀嚼。突然，有人走了过来，把她吓了一跳。她抬起头来，发现这次遇到的不是达西先生，而是菲茨威廉上校。她立刻收起信，勉强作出一副笑脸，说道：

“没想到你也来这儿散步。”

“我正绕庄园兜圈子，”菲茨威廉回答说，“这成了每一年的惯例。我刚还想，转悠完后就到柯府去坐坐呢。你还要往前走很远吗？”

“不，我马上就朝回折。”

她果然走了没多远，就开始往回折。于是，两人一起漫步向柯府走去。

“你星期六真要离开肯特郡吗？”她问道。

“是的——如果达西不再拖延的话。我得听他的安排。他这人干事总是凭着兴趣，想怎么就怎么。”

“他虽然不一定能把事情安排得称心如意，但他至少可以从发号施令中尝到无穷的乐趣。我从未见过哪一个人像达西先生那样热爱权力和为所欲为。”

“他喜欢按自己的意志行事，这固然不错，”菲茨威廉上校说，“可我们大家不都是这样吗？只不过他比许多人的条件优越，因为他手中有钱，而一般人比较穷。我说的都是心窝里的话。作为一个小儿子可就不同了，他得自我克制，仰仗别人的鼻息。”

“依我看，一位伯爵的小儿子绝不会这般凄惨。说正经的，你又懂得什么叫自我克制和仰仗别人的鼻息呢？你什么时候因为钱囊羞涩，想去什么地方去不成，喜欢什么东西买不成呢？”

“也许，在这类事情上，我的处境不算太难。可是遇到重大问题，由于口袋里缺钱，我可就吃苦头了。作为小儿子，是不能够娶自己心上人的。”

“除非那些心上人是富家女。这类情况屡见不鲜。”

“我们花钱花惯了，因此不得不依赖别人。像我这样身份的人，结婚时不计较钱财的，实在找不出几个来。”

“这些话莫非是冲着我来的？”伊丽莎白暗忖。她为自己的这种想法红了脸，但马上便恢复了常态。只听她以轻松活泼的语调说：“请问，一个伯爵的小儿子通常值多少钱？我想，除非你上边的哥哥已病入膏肓，不然你的要价不会超过五万镑。”

菲茨威廉也用同样的语调回了她几句，尔后就把这个话题搁下了。两人相对无语，而伊丽莎白又怕这样沉默下去，会让对方误以为她在为刚才的话难过，于是她连忙说道：

“依我看，你表弟把你带在身边，主要是为了能有个人听他摆布。我不明白他为什么不结婚，如果成了家，不就有人终生服从于他吗？好在眼下有个妹妹在他身边，完全由他一个人操纵。他可以随心所欲地对待自己的妹妹。”

“不对，”菲茨威廉上校说，“他的这种权利得和我共同分享，因为我也是达西小姐的保护人。”

“果真如此？那么请问，你们这两个保护人当得怎么样？在行使权利的时候，感到棘手吗？她这般年龄的小姐有时不太好对付。要是她再耍耍达西家的脾气，那可就任性死啦。”

她说话之间，发现菲茨威廉在正颜厉色地瞧着她。随即，菲茨威廉问她为什么会想到达西小姐难以管理。看他那问话时的神情，她觉得自己猜对了八九成。于是，她直截了当地说：

“你不必感到惊慌。我从没听人说过她的不是。我敢说，她是世界上最听话的姑娘。我的几位女朋友，譬如赫斯特夫人和宾利小姐，特别地喜欢她。你好像说过，你也认识这两位女士。”

“认识是认识，但不太熟。她们的兄弟是个和蔼可亲、很有绅士风度的人——他和达西是亲密无间的朋友。”

“哦！是呀，”伊丽莎白冷冰冰地说，“达西先生对宾利先生那可是体贴到家了，对他关怀得无微不至哩。”

“关怀他！……是的，这我倒是相信，因为在他处于危急关头时，总是达西帮他拿办法。在来这儿的路上，达西给我讲了一件事，从中可以看出他对宾利先生有着多么大的恩情。可是，我得请他原谅，因为我无权断定他讲到的那个人就是宾利。我只不过是瞎猜猜罢啦。”

“你到底要说什么？”

“这件事达西当然不愿意宣扬出去，因为要是传到那位小姐家里人的耳中，准会惹得大家都不高兴。”

“你放心好啦，我绝不说出去。”

“请你记住，我没有充足的理由断定他所说的人就是宾利。他只是告诉我，他最近值得庆幸地帮助一位朋友摆脱了困境，使他放弃了一桩冒昧的婚姻。他既没有指名道姓，也没有讲多少细节。我所以会怀疑到宾利头上，一则因为我觉得像他那样的青年容易在情场上栽跟头，二则由于我知道他们俩去年整整一个夏天都形影不离。”

“达西先生告诉过你没有，他为什么要出面干涉？”

“听说，他觉得女方的条件太差。”

“他是用了什么手段把他们拆散的？”

“他倒没有对我提用了什么手段，”菲茨威廉笑了笑说，“他告诉过我的事情，我刚才都讲给你听了。”

伊丽莎白再没有说什么，只是埋着头朝前走，胸中燃烧着愤怒的烈火。菲茨威廉把她打量了一会儿，然后问她为什么思虑重重。

“我在琢磨你刚才说的那件事，”她说，“我觉得你表弟的做法是不对的。凭什么要他做主？”

“你以为他的干涉是多管闲事？”

“我实在弄不清楚，达西先生凭什么要插手他朋友的婚事，凭什么那般独断专行地要他的朋友服从他的意志，由他决定怎样去获取幸福。不过……”伊丽莎白吁了一口胸中的怒气，继续朝下说道，“咱们不了解其中的底细，过早地指责他显然是不公平的。也许，那一对男女之间根本就没有多少爱呢。”

“这样的推测不能说不合乎情理，”菲茨威廉说，”可我表弟本来为这事还扬扬得意呢，你这一说，岂不抹杀了他的一半功劳。”

这话本来只是开个玩笑，可伊丽莎白却觉得，这倒是对达西先生的真实写照。她认为此事不便深谈，于是急忙来了个一百八十度大转弯，把话头扯到了一些不疼不痒的事情上。他们就这样闲嗑着牙，相伴着走回了柯府。待客人走后，伊丽莎白即刻把自己关进房间里，静静地思考刚才所听到的事情。菲茨威廉所说的那对男女，肯定都是她身边的人。世界上不会再有第二个男人，能对达西先生那样言听计从。达西参与了拆散宾利先生和简的阴谋，对这一点她从来就没怀疑过。可是，她总认为宾利小姐是主谋，活动主要由她安排策划。谁料想，正是由于虚荣心在作怪，达西才成了此事的罪魁祸首。简目前所忍受的种种痛苦以及今后还将经受的磨难，都得归罪于他，归罪于他的傲慢和专横。他毁掉了一个天底下最温柔、最宽仁的女子对幸福的憧憬。谁也说不准，他造下的罪孽何年何月才能了结。

“他觉得女方的条件太差。”这可是菲茨威廉上校的原话。简所谓太差的条件，也许是指她有个在乡下当律师的姨父，还有个在伦敦做买卖的舅父。

“至于简本人，”她不由喊出了声，“她可是完美无瑕的。她是那样可爱，那样善良！她头脑清晰，思想成熟，言谈举止令人心醉神迷。就连我的父亲也没有什么可挑剔的。虽说有些怪癖，但他的能力是达西所不能蔑视的，而他的品德也是达西可望不可及的。”在想到母亲时，她的信心发生了些许动摇。但她又认为，这方面的欠缺对达西不会有多大的影响。在心高气傲的达西看来，最伤他自尊心的莫过于让自己的朋友娶一个卑贱人家的女子，至于这户人家有没有见识，他倒不会过分计较。她最后才算完全明白了，达西一方面受罪恶的傲慢心理支配才坏别人的美事，另一方面，他是想让宾利先生和他的胞妹成双配对。

她越想越气，不禁泪流满面，最后连头也痛了起来。到了晚上，头痛病加剧，再说她也不愿意和达西相见，于是便决定不陪表兄表嫂到罗辛斯庄园喝晚茶了。柯林斯太太见她确实不舒服，就没有勉强她，并且劝丈夫也不要硬逼她去，但柯林斯先生不由犯了愁，唯恐表妹不去会惹凯瑟琳夫人生气。





第三十四章


柯林斯夫妇走后，伊丽莎白拿出她到肯特郡以来简写来的所有信件，一封封仔细阅读起来，似乎存心想加深她对达西的仇恨情绪。信中并没有写埋怨的话，没有提及过去的事情，也没有诉说目前的痛苦。简性情娴淑，待人和善，写信的笔调历来轻松愉快，不夹带一点阴郁的色彩。可是在这些信件里，没有一封，甚至没有一行字可以显露出她往日欢快的文风。伊丽莎白上次读信只是走马观花，而现在把这些信细心读来，发现里面的每一个句子都叫人惶惶不安。记得达西先生曾恬不知耻地吹牛说，叫人家受罪是他的拿手好戏，这就越发使她深刻体会到了姐姐的痛苦。好在达西后天就要离开罗辛斯庄园了，想起来让她有了一丝欣慰感。更令人振奋的是，过不了两个星期，她就要回到简身边了。她将和简交流感情，帮助她重新振作起来。

一想到达西即将离开肯特郡，她就不由记起他的表兄也要随他一道走。菲茨威廉上校已经明确表示过，他对她并没有什么意图。因此，尽管他非常讨人喜欢，她却不愿再自寻烦恼。

刚想到此处，突然听到了门铃声，她以为来的是菲茨威廉上校，于是情绪上又有了波动。菲茨威廉曾经有过夜晚来访的历史，这次可能是特意来向她问安的。但这个念头立刻便打消了，心情也发生了变化，因为她极端震惊地看到达西走进了屋来。达西立足未稳，便匆匆忙忙询问起她的健康情况，并说他到这儿来，就是希望能听到她康复的消息。伊丽莎白冷漠但不失礼节地回答了他的问题。达西坐了下来，但没过几分钟就又立起了身，在屋里踱来踱去。伊丽莎白极为惊讶，但一句话也没说。沉默了一会儿之后，他神情激动地走了过来，对她说道：

“我曾和自己作过斗争，但都以失败告终。我再也无法克制我的感情了。请允许我告诉你，我对你的仰慕和爱恋已到了如醉如痴的程度。”

伊丽莎白吃惊得简直无法形容。她先是瞪着眼，红着脸，满腹狐疑，一声也不吭。达西见此情形，以为她在鼓励他讲下去，便立刻倾吐了目前及以往对她的一片深情。他讲得娓娓动听，除了表达爱情，还详详细细罗列出了其他的感情因素。在陈述自己的傲慢心理时，他侃侃而谈，来得一点儿也不比倾吐柔情蜜意时逊色。他认为她出身卑微，觉得他这样做是屈尊俯就，还强调说他因为爱她才没有在乎她的门第。他为自己所作出的牺牲而陶醉，于是越说越激动。但他没想到，这样的求婚很可能会功亏一篑。

尽管伊丽莎白对他的厌恶之心是根深蒂固的，但遇到这样一个人物向她求爱，她绝不能视而不见、无动于衷。她的意志虽然片刻都没动摇过，但她开头的时候却非常同情他，因为她知道他会在遭到拒绝后感到痛苦。可达西后面的话激起了她的愤怒，把她的恻隐之心化成了满腔的怨恨。她竭力保持镇定，准备耐心地等他把话讲完，再给他一个回答。达西在讲话临近尾声时，重申了自己炽烈的爱。他说他努力想控制住自己的感情，但却难以如愿。他衷心希望，伊丽莎白能够体谅他的心情，接受他的求婚。他说这番话时，伊丽莎白一眼就看出他具有一种稳操胜券的自信感。他虽然口中说自己又担忧又着急，唯恐遭到拒绝，但脸上却是一副万无一失的表情。他的这种态度使伊丽莎白更加恼火。待他讲完之后，伊丽莎白涨红着脸说：

“遇到这类情况，按照常理来说，既然人家向你表白了痴情爱意，你不管能不能以同样的深情进行回报，都应该表达一下感激之心。有点知恩图报的思想，是很自然的。如果我真的觉得你对我有恩，我一定会回报你。可惜我没有这种感觉。我从不企望博得你的青睐，何况你在赐予我这种恩惠时，表现得极为勉强。我实在不愿意给别人带来痛苦，但即便已经造成了痛苦，也是完全出于无心，而且我希望很快就会事过境迁。你对我说，你由于顾虑重重，一直未能向我袒露心中的感情。现在听了我的一番解释，你一定不难打消这种感情。”

达西先生此刻正斜倚在壁炉架上，两眼紧紧盯着她，听了她的一席话，显得又惊奇又气愤。他气得脸色铁青，每一个神情都显露出了他内心的震骇。他竭力装出泰然自若的样子，一直等到他自以为已经恢复了平静的外表，方开口讲话。这片刻的沉默在伊丽莎白看来是那样可怕。最后，才听到达西以故作镇静的声音说道：

“听到你这样的回答，真叫我感到荣幸之至！不过，这没有什么了不起的。我只是想听你解释一下，为什么我的请求会遭到无礼的拒绝。”

“我也想请教请教，你为什么要蓄意侮辱我、冒犯我的人格，为什么要向我声明，你对我的感情既违背了你的心愿和理智，也与你的性情格格不入？假使我果真对你不恭不敬的话，你的倒行逆施难道不能成为我的理由吗？除此之外，我还有别的理由呢，这你心中有数。即便我对你没有反感，跟你毫无芥蒂，甚至对你还有几分好印象，你难道会以为我能爱上一个毁掉了我最亲爱的姐姐，也许永远断送了她幸福的人吗？”

达西听了她这些话，一下子变了脸色，但马上就又平静了下来。他没有打岔，一声不吭地听她继续朝下讲：

“我有充足的理由鄙视你。在那件事上，你扮演了一个邪恶而不光彩的角色，任何借口都无法为你开脱。说起他们两人被拆散，即便不是你一手造成的，你也是主谋，这你不敢抵赖，也抵赖不了。他们可是让你害苦了，男的被世人指责为朝三暮四，女的却被耻笑为痴心妄想。”

她说到这里打住了话头，抬头见达西毫无懊悔之意，不由气得火冒三丈。说来也真让人生气，达西甚至还装出一副不相信的样子，笑吟吟地望着她。

“你对自己的所作所为还能抵赖得掉吗？”伊丽莎白厉声问道。

他故作镇定地答道：“我什么也不想抵赖。为了使我的朋友离开你的姐姐，我的确做到了不遗余力，并且为最后的成功感到欣慰。我对宾利先生可谓仁至义尽，比对我自己还好呢。”

伊丽莎白听了他这番咬文嚼字的反省词，表面上装着没太留意，但内心却明明白白，于是越加怒火难平。

“我不仅仅是在这件事上厌恶你，”她继续说道，“早在此案发生之前，我就对你有了成见。好几个月前，威克姆先生把你的为人都告诉给了我。这下，你还有什么可说的？难道你还能把友谊拿出来做幌子，为自己的行径辩护吗。难道你还要颠倒黑白、蒙骗世人吗？”

“看来你对那位先生的事情倒是十分关心。”达西说道，口吻已不如刚才那样坦然，脸色变得更红了。

“凡是了解他悲惨遭遇的人，谁能不关心他？”

“哼，他的悲惨遭遇！”达西轻蔑地重复了一声，“是呀，他的遭遇的确悲惨得很呢。”

“他的不幸都是你一手造成的，”伊丽莎白气呼呼地说，“是你把他逼得穷困潦倒——当然，所谓穷困是相对而言的。你明明知道他应该享有某些特权，可你却迟迟不肯交给他。当时他正年轻力壮，理应拿到自己的一份财产，独立地生活，而你剥夺了他的权利。这些罪孽都是你造下的！可别人一提到他的不幸，你竟然还报以轻蔑和嘲讽的目光。”

“原来你就是这样隔着门缝瞧我！”达西大声嚷着，快步在屋里走了起来，“看来，这就是你对我的评价！谢谢你解释得如此透彻。根据你的分析，我的确罪孽深重！不过……”他停住了脚步，把身子也扭了过来，“只怪我如实讲出了早就隐藏在我心底，并阻止我向你表白感情的那些顾虑，刺伤了你的自尊心，不然你就不会计较这些事情。我如果玩个心眼，把所有的矛盾都掩饰起来，而只是拣好听的说，让你相信我从理智到思想，无论各方面都对你抱有无条件的、纯洁的爱，你也许就不会这样严厉地指责我了，可我做人光明磊落，讨厌藏藏掖掖。所以，我并不为自己所袒露的顾虑感到惭愧。这些顾虑是自然的，正当的。难道你指望我为你有些卑微的亲戚而欢欣鼓舞吗？难道你期望我因为要交上社会地位远不如我的亲戚而感到庆幸吗？”

伊丽莎白越听越气，但她控制住自己的感情，心平气和地说：

“达西先生，倘若你礼貌一些，我拒绝了你也许会感到过意不去。除此之外，你要是以为你的那套表白方式会使我产生别的想法，那你就大错特错了。”

她看到他愣了一下神，但却没有做声，于是，她继续朝下说道：

“你不管采取什么样的方式向我求婚，都别指望我会应允。”

这时，达西的脸上又浮起了惊愕的神情，只见他用诧异而屈辱的目光瞧着她。而伊丽莎白继续说道：

“我最初认识你时——或者说，第一次和你相遇时——我就从你的言谈举止中看出你是个高傲自大、自私自利、不管别人死活的人。我先是对你不满，后来又发生了一系列事件，致使这种不满情绪演变成了对你的厌恶。我认识你还不足一个月，就已经觉得，哪怕一辈子找不到男人，也绝不嫁给你。”

“你说得已经够多啦，小姐。你的心情我完全理解。现在，我只是对自己以前所产生过的念头感到羞耻。请原谅我占用了你这么多时间。再见，我衷心祝愿你身体健康、生活幸福。”

说完，他大步流星地走出了房间。接着，伊丽莎白听见他打开前门，离开了柯府。

她心烦意乱，不知如何才能撑住自己。最后，她虚弱得瘫了下来，整整哭了半个小时。回忆起刚才的情景，她越想越觉得惊奇。谁能料到，达西先生会向她求婚呢！而且他竟然偷偷地爱恋她达数月之久！他的爱是那样强烈，竟然无视于种种不利因素，想和她结百年之好。想当初，正是由于这些不利因素，他才阻挠他的朋友娶她的姐姐。现在轮到他头上，那些因素至少对他具有同样大的压力呀！他的表现真叫人难以置信！一个人能在不知不觉之中博得别人倾心相爱，也足够自慰了。然而，他为人傲慢，而且傲得令人作呕，居然恬不知耻地承认他破坏了简的婚事，承认的过程中虽然不能自圆其说，却流露出一种不可饶恕的狂妄神气。还有，他提起威克姆先生时是那样冷酷无情，全然不想否认他对威克姆的残忍行径。一想到这些事件，伊丽莎白的那点因为念及他的钟情而激起的恻隐之心，顿时也化为乌有。她这样回肠百转地左思右想，直到后来听到凯瑟琳夫人的马车声，她才感觉到自己的这副模样见不得夏洛特，便匆忙回到了自己的房间里。





第三十五章


夜里，伊丽莎白苦思冥想，一直到合眼睡去。次日早晨醒来，她的大脑还是翻江倒海地千思百虑。她仍在为那件事感到惊奇，左思右想总在老问题上打转转。她没有心思做事，于是刚刚吃过早饭，便决定出去散散步，呼吸一点新鲜空气。当她正想往那条心爱的小径上走时，突然想起达西也常到这儿来，于是不由留住了脚步。她没有进庄园里，而是折进小胡同，离大马路越来越远。她依然沿着庄园的围栏走，不久便进了一道园门。

在一条窄道上走了两三个来回，她不禁被早晨的美景深深吸引住了，于是在栅栏门边停了下来，放眼向园内望去。在她来到肯特郡的五个星期里，这一带的景色变得更加迷人，早绿的树木一天比一天青翠。她举步正欲朝前走，不料瞅见庄园旁边的林子里有个男子，正在向她走来。她害怕那人就是达西，便连忙朝回走。可是来人已走近，一眼瞧见了她，于是喊了声她的名字，急步奔上前来。伊丽莎白已经掉过了头去，但听到有人喊她（根据声音判断，无疑是达西），便又转回了身子，向栅栏门边走了过来。此时，达西也赶到了门前，取出一封信递给她，而她不由自主接了过去。随后，他带着一种傲慢而从容的神气说：“我在林子里转悠好久了，希望能碰见你，你能不能给我个面子，把这封信好好看看？”话音一落，他就欠身行了个礼，掉头走进林子，很快消失了。

伊丽莎白并不指望从中获得什么乐趣，但在强烈好奇心的驱使下，还是拆开了信。使她越加惊奇的是，信封里装着两页信纸，写得密密麻麻，满满当当，连信封上也写满了字。她一面顺着窄路行走，一边展信读了起来。信是早晨八点钟在罗辛斯庄园写的，内容如下：


小姐，接到这封信时，请不必惊慌。昨晚向你倾吐衷情和提出求婚，结果弄得我自讨没趣，所以在这儿我不会旧事重提。我既不想使你感到痛苦，也不打算叫我自己再次蒙辱，故而在此处不谈我的那些心愿。从咱们俩的幸福着想，最好尽快忘掉那些荒唐的念头。由于性情执拗，我不得不写这封信，还害得你也得费神阅读，不然倒可以双方省事，各自都落个清闲。所以，请恕我冒昧劳你的大驾。我清楚，你绝不愿读这封信，但为了伸张正义，请你务必一览。

昨晚，你曾把两个性质不同、轻重不等的罪名加在了我头上。你先是指责我无视宾利先生和你姐姐的感情，硬拆散了一对鸳鸯。接着，你又说我不顾别人的利益，践踏别人的荣誉和人格，指控我使威克姆先生的荣华富贵毁于一旦，断送了他的锦绣前程。这样，我成了喜怒无常的人，无情无义地抛弃了自己童年时的伙伴、家父宠爱的养子、一个无依无靠的青年，或者说是一个从小就指望得到我们家恩惠的青年。于是，我犯下了弥天大罪。相形之下，拆散那一对青年男女就成了小过错，因为他们的罗曼史只不过有几个星期。现在，我想把自己的行为和动机逐一剖白，希望你弄明白了其中的原委之后，将来不再像昨晚那样对我严词苛责。在解释这些与我息息相关的事件过程中，如有冒犯之处，多请你原谅。我写这封信也是出于不得已，所以再道歉就显得可笑了。

我到哈福德郡时间不长，就和其他人一样，发现宾利对令姐脉脉含情。但是，直到尼瑟费德举行舞会的那天晚上，我才真正产生了忧虑，因为我觉得他对令姐的爱是认真的。以前，我倒是常见他堕入情网。可是在那次舞会上，当我非常荣幸地和你跳舞时，才听到威廉·卢卡斯爵士偶然说起宾利先生对令姐的殷勤已经弄得满城风雨，大家都认为他们将喜结良缘。听他说话的口气，好像事情已成定局，办事只是早晚的问题。从那时起，我就开始仔细留意我那朋友的一举一动。经过观察，我发现他对贝内特小姐一往情深，与以往我见到的情况大不相同。另外，我对令姐也进行了观察。她的神情举止一如往初，仍是那样开朗、活泼和迷人，然而却看不出钟情于某人的任何迹象。根据那一个晚上的细心研究，我坚信令姐虽然高高兴兴接受了宾利对她献的殷勤，但她自己却像是局外人，没有着意促进他们之间的情意。在这件事上，如果你没有搞错的话，那就是我判断失误。鉴于你比我更了解令姐，所以很可能过错在我。倘若事实果真如此，倘若我鬼使神差地给令姐带来了痛苦，那也就难怪你发那么大的火。不过恕我直言，令姐声色不动、神态安详，明眼人一看就知道，她尽管性情温和，但她的心却不容易打动。当时我的确希望她无动于衷，但我敢夸口，我的观察和推断一般不受我的希望或疑虑的影响。我绝不是因为希望令姐无动于衷，就断定她确实无动于衷。我的看法不偏不倚，但愿也是合情合理的。昨晚我承认过，这门亲事有些不利的因素，若是放在我头上，还真得具备无比强烈的情感，才能置其于不顾。至于门户高低的问题，我的朋友倒不像我那样斤斤计较。除此之外，还有一些别的条件也叫我颇为不满，这些不利的因素虽说依然存在，而且在两桩事里同样存在着，不过我眼不见心不烦，总想尽量把它们忘干净。在这里，必须谈谈这些因素，即便是简单谈谈也可以。你母亲的娘家虽然不够体面，但与你的那个不成体统的家庭相比，就显得无足轻重了。你母亲和你的三个妹妹是那样粗俗，有时就连令尊大人也难登大雅之堂。请原谅我。我实在不愿意冒犯你的尊严。我知道你为自己亲人的缺点感到难过，也知道我这样形容他们会让你不高兴。可是你和令姐举止优雅，人家非但没有责难到你们头上，反而对你们赞赏备至，交口称道你们俩的见识和情操，这样想想应该使你感到欣慰。我还想告诉你，经过那天晚上的观察，我对每个人的看法都更加坚定，成见也急剧加深，于是决心阻止我的朋友去缔结一门在我看来是最不幸的亲事。我相信你一定还记得，宾利第二天就离开尼瑟费德到伦敦去了，他当时打算速去速回。

现在，我想解释一下我在这件事中所扮演的角色。宾利的姐姐及妹妹和我一样，都为他牵肠挂肚。我们很快就沟通了感情，都觉得事不宜迟，必须尽快把宾利和令姐隔离起来，于是我们当下决定把他拦在伦敦。就这样，我们赶到了伦敦。一见到我的朋友，我立即就向他力陈这门亲事的种种弊端。我苦口婆心，再三劝说。在这之后，他的决心也许有所动摇，态度也变得迟疑不决，但我当时若不是紧接着又断然告诉他令姐对他并非真心实意，我想我的劝告最终还是阻拦不住这门亲事。他以前总认为，令姐感情即便不似他那般炽烈，也是实心眼待他好。不过，他天性谦和，遇事缺乏主见，喜欢靠我拿主意。所以，要让他相信自己看错了人，并不是件太难的事。在他认识到自己的错误后，再劝他不要返回哈福德郡，也就不费吹灰之力了。我这么做，并没有什么可后悔的。回想起来，我只做过一件叫人不太满意的事，即：我竟然不择手段地向他隐瞒了令姐来城里的消息。我和宾利小姐都知道这事，只有宾利先生至今还蒙在鼓里。其实，即使他们见了面，也不一定会产生恶劣的后果，但宾利对令姐的心仍没有死，所以还是保险些好。我这样隐瞒，这样遮掩，也许有失自己的身份。然而，事情已经做出来了，而且完全出于一片好意。关于这件事，我再没有别的话可说了，也不想再道歉了。如果我伤了令姐的心，也是出于无意。我这样做，你自然会觉得我的理由不够充分，但截止到目前我还不知道自己错在哪里。

下来要谈的是另一项罪名，一项更为严厉的指控：我断送了威克姆先生的一切。我只有一个办法为自己辩白，那就是把他和我们家的关系全部呈现在你面前。我弄不清他具体是怎样编派我的，但我所讲的全是事实，可以找出不少信誉卓著的人为我作证。

威克姆先生的父亲是个德高望重的人，多年来一直为彭伯里管理财产。由于他克尽己任、品行端正，家父自然而然就想做些事情报答他。于是，家父认乔治·威克姆做了教子，对他恩宠有加，供他进学堂，后来还送他上了剑桥大学。对乔治·威克姆而言，这是一种较为重要的帮助，因为他母亲挥霍无度，害得他父亲囊空如洗，无力供他受高等教育。家父不仅喜欢和这位风度翩翩的年轻人来往，而且非常器重他，希望他能从事教会职业，一心想给他在那儿安排一个位置。而我的眼睛是雪亮的，多年前就看穿了他的五脏六腑。他为人放荡不羁，恶习重重。他虽然十分小心地把自己伪装起来，不让他最好的朋友发现他的真面目，可是究竟逃不过一个年龄和他相仿的年轻人的注意。我在他不提防的时候看出了他的许多破绽，而家父却没有这种机会。这里，我不免又要引起你的痛苦了，具体痛苦到什么程度，只有你自己知道。不管威克姆先生勾发了你什么样的感情，可我却怀疑他目的不纯，因而我就不得不揭出他的真正品行。当然，这儿还会有别的用心。

家父于五年前仙逝了，临终之际仍然非常宠爱威克姆先生，在遗嘱中特别叮咛我，要我斟酌他的职业情况，尽力提拔他，要是他受了圣职，俸禄优厚的位子一有空缺，便立即让他补上去。此外，还给威克姆的名下划了一千镑的遗产。家父去世没多久，他的父亲也离开了人世。这几件大事发生以后，不出半年工夫，威克姆先生就写信告诉我，说他已最后下定了决心，不愿意接受圣职。他指出，他既然放弃了那个职位的俸禄，我就应该给他一些直接的经济利益，并希望我不要以为他的要求不合乎情理。他说他倒有意去学法律，可是仅靠一千镑的利息维持，是远远不够的。我当时倒不是真的信了他的话，而只是希望他的态度是认真的。但不管怎么说，我欣然答应了他的请求。既然他不愿意当牧师，那么我们很快就商量妥了解决问题的办法：他彻底放弃接受圣职的权利，即便将来有了机会，也不再提出要求，而我拿出三千镑给他作为补偿。自此，我们俩就算是一刀两断了。我十分瞧不起他，不愿再邀请他到彭伯里去，就是在城里也不愿见到他。他的大部分时间都泡在城里，但所谓的学法律只不过是个幌子。既然摆脱了所有的束缚，他便过起了游手好闲、放浪形骸的生活。约莫有三年的时间，我很少听到他的音讯。但是，原定由他接任的那个牧师去世之后，他又写信给我，要我举荐他。他说他的境况窘迫到了极点，这我倒不难相信。他说他发现学法律太无利可图，现在已打定主意，只要我举荐他当牧师，他绝不再反悔。他相信我一定会举荐他，因为除了他，再没有人需要得到我的照拂了。再说我也不会忘记家父的一片心愿。我拒绝了他的请求，以后他又三番五次地纠缠：统统遭到了我的回绝。你大概不会因此而怪罪我吧。他的境遇越困厄，怨愤就越深。他不仅恶言恶语地指责我，还在背后把我骂得狗血喷头。从此以后，我们所有的缘分都算了结了。我不知道他的日子过得怎么样。可是去年夏天，他又蓦然出现在了我面前，真是叫我苦恼至极。

在这里，我得讲一件我不愿提起的事情。此事我本来不愿意让任何人知道，可是这一次却非要说一说不可。说到这里，我相信你一定会严守秘密。我妹妹比我小十多岁，由我和母亲的外甥菲茨威廉上校做她的保护人。大约一年前，我们把她从学校接出来，安置在伦敦居住。去年夏天，她和负责照管她的那位女士一道去了拉姆斯盖特。威克姆先生也跟到了那里，显然是别有用心。原来，他和扬格太太早就认识。都怪我们早先没有认清扬格太太的本性，想起来让人伤心。在她的默许和协助下，威克姆得寸进尺，竟向乔治亚娜求起了爱。乔治亚娜是个重感情的姑娘，还铭记着他小时候对她的情意，此时自以为爱上了他，于是，答应随他私奔。她才十五岁，所以年幼无知是她上当受骗的原因。在这件事上，她的确过于鲁莽胆大，但我要高兴地添一句，最后还是多亏了她，我才知道了真相。就在他们计划私奔的前一两天，我出其不意地找到了他们那儿。乔治亚娜一直把我像慈父一样看待，不忍惹我伤心，便把她和威克姆的恋情全盘托给了我。可想而知，我当时是多么地震怒，又会采取什么样的行动。为了顾全妹妹的荣誉和情绪，我没有把事情闹大，而是给威克姆先生写了封信，责令他赶快滚蛋。当然，扬格太太也卷起铺盖被迫离开了。威克姆先生主要盯着我妹妹的那三万镑财产，这是毋庸置疑的，但也不能排除他的另一明显的动机——他企图借此向我进行报复。他的阴谋差一点得逞。

小姐，我已经如实地陈述了这几桩与咱俩都有关系的事件。如果你觉得我不是在撒谎的话，那我希望你忘掉他的鬼话，不要再说我对他残酷无情了。不知威克姆先生是怎样花言巧语才欺骗了你。不过，也难怪他能如愿以偿，因为你当初的确不了解我们之间的恩恩怨怨。你那时对一切都深信不疑，故无从得知事情的真相。

你也许会这样问：为什么昨晚上没有把这一切告诉你。那是因为我当时拿不定主意，不知哪些话可讲，哪些话不可讲。我在这里所披露的事情件件属实，可以请菲茨威廉上校为我作证。他是我的近亲和至交，又是家父遗嘱的一个执行人，自然对这些事的细枝末节都了如指掌。倘若你对我恨之入骨，把我的话看得一文不值，你绝不会对我的表兄也抱有成见，连他的话也不信吧。所以，你最好去找他问个究竟。今天早晨，我将寻个机会把这封信交到你手中。最后，我想加一句：愿上帝保佑你。

菲茨威廉·达西





第三十六章


伊丽莎白从达西手中接过信的时候，她并未抱有幻想，以为达西会向她再次提出求婚。她实在猜不透，信里讲的到底是什么内容。可是展信一看说的是这些事，你便可想而知，她读起信来心情是多么迫切，感情是多么复杂。酸甜苦辣一齐涌上心头，简直无法形容。起初她感到惊奇：达西居然以为还能为自己辩白。接着，她得出了坚定不移的结论：他理亏词穷，只要稍微还有一点廉耻感，就不会掩饰这一点。她抱着任你怎么说我都不相信的强烈偏见，读起了他所陈述的发生在尼瑟费德的那段往事。她急着朝下读，简直来不及仔细品味。她还没看完一句就想知道下一句讲的是什么事，所以，每一句都理解得很肤浅。达西说她的姐姐对宾利缺乏真情实意，她立即断定他在胡扯八道。接下来，他把简和宾利的恋情说得一无是处，一桩桩列举了诸多欠缺的条件，气得她真不想再朝后读了。他对自己的所作所为，没有表示丝毫的遗憾，这叫她极为不满。他的语气盛气凌人，没有一点后悔的意思。总之，他目空一切，傲慢无礼。

当读到有关威克姆先生的那个段落时，她的思路略为清晰了些。如果达西所说的情况属实，威克姆在她心目中的形象就会一落千丈。信中提到的事情与威克姆所讲的他自己的身世，读起来是那样地相似，这就使她内心越加痛苦，感情也更为复杂。她感到非常诧异、疑虑，甚至还有几分恐惧。她真想推翻他所说的所有事情，便一遍遍地叫嚷道：“这是捏造出来的！绝不可能是真的！好一个弥天大谎！”她把全信读完之后，连最后一两页的意思都糊里糊涂没搞清，就连忙把信收了起来，自言自语地声称那些事情与她无关，所以，她懒得再看第二眼。

她心乱如麻，思路飘游不定，信步朝前走着。可是不出半分钟，她又按捺不住，于是便取出信，尽量定下心来，又忍痛读起了跟威克姆有关的那些话，硬逼着自己去细细琢磨每一句话的意思。信中所提到的他与彭伯里家族的关系，与他自己讲的完全一致。另外，她虽然并不清楚已故的达西先生对他的恩情到底大到何种程度，但信里的话和他自己的叙述一点也不矛盾。到此处为止，双方的言词可以相互印证。可是一接触到遗嘱问题，两人的说法就大相径庭了。威克姆所言牧师俸禄之事，她仍记忆犹新。仔细想来，她就不由感到，他们俩当中准有一个人在撒谎。就在那短短的一点时间里，她觉得自己先前的看法是准确无误的。可是当她把达西的信又仔仔细细读了两遍之后，威克姆借口放弃牧师俸禄从而获得三千镑的补偿，这些具体的细节又令她犹豫了起来。她放下信，抱着不偏不倚的态度开始左右掂量每一个环节，仔细斟酌每一句话，然而却分析不出什么名堂来。双方各执一词，难断孰是孰非。她只得再往下读。她原以为，任凭达西怎样花言巧语、颠倒是非，也掩饰不了他那罪恶行径，但这次读信时她发现，每一个句子都表明：达西很可能是完全清白无辜的。

达西毫不迟疑地把骄奢淫逸的罪名加在威克姆的头上，这使她大为震惊。再加上她又找不出证据驳斥他的说法，所以她就更觉骇然。威克姆只是在城里偶然遇见了一位泛泛之交的朋友，在对方的劝说下才到民兵营入伍的，而于此之前，她压根就没听说过这个人。至于他过去的生活方式，哈福德郡的居民一无所知，只偏听了他的一面之词。对他本人的品行，她即便可以打听到些情况，也不愿去寻根究底。光凭他英俊的外貌及优雅的言谈举止，立刻便能博得人心，让人觉得他具备一切美德。她竭力要回忆起一两件足以说明他品行端正的事例，回忆起他为人诚实仁慈的特点，让达西的诽谤不攻自破，或者，至少可以凭借他显著的优点，来弥补他的偶然过失（达西说他长年累月游手好闲、不务正业，而她认为那不过是偶然的过失）。可惜她想来想去，就是想不出他有这样的优点。她眨巴一下眼睛就能看到他出现在她面前，风度翩翩，谈吐不凡，但除了四邻八舍对他的夸赞，以及他运用交际手腕在伙伴中间赢得些许好感之外，她却记不起他有哪些具体的长处。她沉吟良久，之后，又继续朝下读。可是天哪！她接下来就读到他对达西小姐图谋不轨，这只要想想她昨天上午跟菲茨威廉上校的谈话，不就可以证实了吗？信上最后建议她把每一个细节都去问问菲茨威廉上校，由他解释是否真有此事。她曾经听上校谈过，说他对他表弟所有的事情都非常关心，这她完全相信，因为她没有任何理由去怀疑他的人格。一时间，她差点真的要去向上校问个究竟，但转念一想，这样问起来会让人觉得尴尬，于是，便把这个主意搁置了起来。后来她又想到，如果达西先生对他表兄的证词没有十二分把握，他就绝不会冒冒失失提这样的建议，于是，她就干脆打消了这个念头。

那天晚上，她在菲利普斯姨父家跟威克姆进行了第一次交谈，其中所讲的事情她至今都一桩桩记得清清楚楚。他有许多原话，都根深蒂固地印在了她的脑海中。现在想起来，和一个陌生人进行这样交心的谈话的确十分冒昧，她奇怪自己以前怎么就没意识到这一点。她觉得他自我标榜显得粗俗不堪，更何况他言行不一、漏洞百出，更是有失体统。记得他曾吹嘘说他一点也不怕见到达西，达西要是怕他，可以躲到一边去，而他绝不退缩。可是，就在第二个星期尼瑟费德举办舞会的时候，逃之夭夭的却是他威克姆。她还记得，尼瑟费德那班人马未离开乡下之前，他除了跟她，再没有向第二个人泄露过自己的身世。可那班人马一走，他的事情便传遍了各个角落。他口口声声对她说，他对达西的父亲非常敬重，不忍心揭露其子的罪恶行径，但实际上，他不遗余力、肆无忌惮地诋毁达西先生的人格。

凡是与他有关的事情，前后截然不同！他之所以向金小姐献殷勤，现在看来，完全是为了金钱，实在令人憎恶。金小姐的钱财并不多，但这不能说明他的欲望不高，而是证实了他贪婪成性，见利就眼红。他对待她伊丽莎白也动机不纯，不是误以为她有钱，就是企图征服她以满足自己的虚荣心，而她自己也太不谨慎，居然让他看出了她喜欢他。她越想就对他越没有好感，天平逐渐倒向了达西一边。很久以前，简就他和达西的关系曾经问过宾利先生，宾利说达西没有可指责之处。达西虽然态度傲慢，让人接受不了，但自从他们认识以来（特别是最近他们时常见面，她对他的为人处世也更加熟悉），从没见过他有什么行为不检点或是蛮不讲理的地方，从没有见过他有什么违反教规或是伤风败俗的陋习。亲友们都尊敬和器重他，就连威克姆也把他看做自己的兄长。他在谈到自己的妹妹时，总是柔情种种，一听便知道他很有些人情味。他的所作所为如果真像威克姆说的那样可憎，那么，他的胡作非为难以掩尽天下人的耳目。再说，倘若他是个为非作歹的人，竟会跟宾利先生这样的大好人交上朋友，那才叫人不可思议呢。

她惭愧得无地自容。无论是想到达西还是威克姆，她总觉得自己好坏不分、态度偏颇、成见太深，显得不近情理。

“我做事真是太不长眼睛！”她不由地叫出了声来，“亏我还自以为善辨真伪，而扬扬得意呢！亏我老是觉得自己精明强干呢！对于姐姐的宽厚仁慈，我常常嗤之以鼻。为了满足自己的虚荣心，我做事总是疑神疑鬼，真是又荒唐又可笑。说起来我的确丢尽了人，不过这都是我活该自找的！即便我真的陷入了情网，也不该盲目到这种可悲的地步呀。然而，我的愚蠢不在于恋爱不恋爱，而是虚荣心在作怪。开头刚刚认识他们两位的时候，一个喜欢我，我就感到高兴，一个怠慢我，我则觉得生气。因此，在对待他俩的问题上，我简直丧失了理智，让偏见冲昏了头脑，表现得是那样无知。直到现在，我才算真正了解了自己。”

她心里千头万绪，从她自己想到简，又从简想到宾利。这时，她突然觉得达西对那件事解释得不够彻底。于是，她把他的信又读了一遍。第二遍读起来，效果大不一样。在一件事上，她不得不相信了达西的话，那么在另一件事上，态度也不能过于顽固。达西声称，他完全没想到简会对宾利萌发爱情，这使她想起了夏洛特对简的看法。她不得不承认，达西把简分析得的确淋漓尽致。简感情炽烈，但表面上却不显山不露水。她平时那副安然自得的神态，实在让人看不出她的多愁善感。

读到有关她家里人的那一段时，她觉得达西的分析虽然伤人感情，但却入情入理，于是她越加羞愧难当。他的指责一针见血，让她无法否认。他特别提到了尼瑟费德舞会上的情况，正是那天晚上他才开始反对宾利和简结亲。其实，那时的场面不仅使他难以忘怀，伊丽莎白想起来也记忆犹新。

至于达西对她们姐妹俩的恭维，她读后心里也有所感触。她觉得非常舒心，但却没因此而感到安慰。都怪家中其他的人不争气，让人瞧不起。她认为简的失恋其实是由自己的至亲骨肉所造成的。亲人行为的不检点，使她们姐妹俩蒙羞受辱，伊丽莎白想到这里，感到一阵从未有过的沮丧。

她沿着那条窄路徘徊了两个小时，心中如沸腾的开水一样上下翻滚，把每一件事都作了仔细分析，都作了重新考虑，并且权衡了各种可能性。这一突然的变化事关重大，迫使她不得不面对现实。后来，她周身疲倦，这才记起出门已久，应该回去休息了。进屋的时候，她希望自己看上去和平时一样轻松愉快，于是，决计抑制住内心繁杂的思绪，免得和人说话时露出破绽。

一进柯府，就听说她不在的时候，罗辛斯庄园的那两位先生来造访过。达西只待了几分钟，就起身告辞了，而菲茨威廉上校起码坐了一个钟头，期望她赶快归来，差一点还跑出去找她。伊丽莎白没见上他的面，虽然表面上装出很惋惜的样子，但心里却十分高兴。因为，她心目中已没有上校的位子了，而只是惦记着那封信。





第三十七章


第二天早晨，那两位先生辞别了罗辛斯庄园。柯林斯侍立在门房旁边，鞠着躬为他们送行。他带回家一条振奋人心的消息：两位先生虽刚刚在罗辛斯经受了一场生离死别的痛苦，但看上去依然身体健康、精神饱满。接着，他又马不停蹄地赶到庄园里去安慰凯瑟琳夫人母女俩。回府的时候，他喜气洋洋地带来了夫人的口信，说夫人觉得烦闷，切望大家能到庄园里和她一道进餐。

伊丽莎白见到凯瑟琳夫人时，心中不由暗忖：假如她当初接受了达西的求婚，现在恐怕行礼时就改变了身份，成为夫人未来的外甥媳妇了。一想到夫人会气得七窍冒烟，她就觉得好笑。于是，她用这样的问题来和自己打趣：“她老人家对我们的婚事会发表什么言论呢？她的态度将会如何？”

大家一开始就谈到了达西表兄弟别离罗辛斯庄园的事情。凯瑟琳夫人说：“不瞒众位，我心里真是难过极啦。我相信，朋友走了，谁也不会像我这么伤心。对于这两个小伙子，我真是打心眼里喜欢，我知道他们也非常依恋我！他们实在舍不得离开这儿，其实他们素来如此。亲爱的上校临行时尚能强打精神，可达西却难以控制住自己的伤感，看上去比去年还要痛苦哩。他对罗辛斯庄园的感情一年深似一年。”

话说到此处，柯林斯赶紧恭维了几句，还暗示了一下原因，母女俩听了，都和善地嫣然一笑。

吃过饭之后，凯瑟琳夫人发现贝内特小姐闷闷不乐，便胡乱猜起了原因，以为她不愿这么快就回家去。于是，她这样对伊丽莎白说道：

“假如不愿走，就给你妈妈写封信，请求再待一段时间。我相信，有你陪伴左右，柯林斯太太一定会非常高兴。”

伊丽莎白回答道：“多谢您好心挽留，可惜我不能领受盛情。我下星期六一定要进城去。”

“可惜这么一来，你在这儿只能住六个星期啦。我原以为你会待够两个月呢，这话你来前我就对柯林斯太太讲过。其实，你用不着走得这么急。贝内特太太一定会允许你再住两个星期。”

“家父却不会同意。他上星期就写信来催我回去。”

“嗨！如果母亲允许你留下，做父亲的一定不会逼你上路。女儿家对父亲来说，是无足轻重的。如果你们再待一个月，我就可以带你们当中的一个上伦敦去，因为，我六月初要到那儿住一个星期。道森既然愿意驾四轮马车走，自然可以宽宽敞敞捎一个脚。要是天气凉爽的话，我不妨带你俩一道走，好在你们的块头都不大。”

“您的心肠真是太好啦，夫人。可我觉得，我们不能临时改变原来的计划。”

凯瑟琳夫人不便勉强，于是说道：“柯林斯太太，你必须差一位仆人送她们走。你知道我一向心直口快，两位年轻小姐孤单单乘驿车赶路，叫我实在放心不下。这样做太不像话，我最看不惯的就是这种事，所以，请你务必派个人送送她们。年轻小姐根据各自不同的身份，都应该受到适当的保护和关照。去年夏天我的外甥女乔治亚娜到拉姆斯盖特去的时候，我特意强调让她带两名男仆随行。达西小姐身为彭伯里的千金，达西老先生及安妮夫人的掌上明珠，不那样就难免有失体统。我特别注重这类事情。柯林斯太太，你应该打发约翰送这两位小姐。幸亏我及时提了这条建议，否则，让她们孤零零地自个儿走，把你的面子都会丢光的。”

“舅舅会派人来接我们的。”

“什么！你舅舅！他真的有男仆吗？有人操心着你们，这让我听了高兴。你们打算在哪儿换马呢？对啦，当然是在布罗姆利喽。只要在贝尔客栈提提我的名字，就会有人关照你们。”

关于她们的旅程，凯瑟琳夫人有许多话要问，而且还不全是自问自答，这就要求她们用心去听。伊丽莎白倒觉得有些侥幸，不然的话，光顾得想心事，她很可能会思想抛锚，弄出笑话来，有心事就应该等到独自一个人的时候再去想。周围如果没有人，她可以自由自在想个痛快。每天她都要独自出门散步，边走边尽兴地回忆那些令人惆怅的往事。

对于达西的那封信，没过多久她就基本上能倒背如流了。她反复研究了每一句话，对写信人忽冷忽热，感情变化非常大。一想起他那辛辣的笔调，她就觉得肚子憋了一团火。可是，一考虑到以前错怪过他、错骂过他，她就把怒火转移到了自己身上。他那沮丧的情绪引起了她的同情；他对她一往情深，这叫她感激涕零；他的人格赢得了她的尊敬。可是，她对他却怎么也爱不起来，拒绝他后，不曾有过片刻的懊悔，也从未产生过再见他的任何愿望。她时常为自己过去的行为感到苦恼和遗憾，家人的种种叫人伤心的缺陷更让她愁肠百结。这些缺陷都是无可救药的。父亲对家里的不幸总是掉以轻心、一笑置之，懒得去约束几个小女儿放荡轻佻的行为。母亲本人就有失检点，所以根本不清楚什么是对的，什么是错的。伊丽莎白和简同心合力，企图纠正凯瑟琳和莉迪亚的不轨行为，但由于母亲一味纵容两个小女儿，所以，她们始终没有一点长进。凯瑟琳意志薄弱，还喜欢发发脾气，完全受莉迪亚的操纵，对姐姐们的规劝历来置若罔闻。莉迪亚刚愎自用，干事马虎，也很少能听得进她们的话。两个妹妹愚昧无知、好逸恶劳，还贪慕虚荣。只要麦里屯有军官，她们就跑去打情骂俏。鉴于浪搏恩距麦里屯只有一小段路程，她们天天都要朝那儿跑。

伊丽莎白还有一桩心事，那就是为简牵肠挂肚。达西的一通解释恢复了她对宾利的好感，同时，也就越发使她觉得简损失巨大。宾利的感情经证实是忠贞不渝的，他的行为是无可指责的，万一要指责的话，顶多也只能怪他盲目信任他的朋友。简遇到了一个各方面都非常理想的机缘，既可以得到种种好处，又可望获得终身幸福，只可惜家里人愚昧无知、行为失检，断送了这个机缘，想起来怎不叫人痛心！

忆及这些往事时，伊丽莎白也想到了威克姆，并逐渐认清了他的丑恶本性。她一向性格开朗，很少有过情绪消沉的时候，现在心里受到莫大的刺激，连强作欢颜也几乎办不到了。

在她们离开前的最后一星期里，罗辛斯庄园三天两头请她们赴宴，和她们初来乍到时的情形一模一样。最后的一个夜晚也是在庄园里度过的。凯瑟琳夫人又详细问起了她们旅程的具体细节，指示她们如何打点行李，并再三强调要把长礼服放得规规矩矩。听过她面授机宜，玛丽亚决定回去后就把早晨打好的行装全部解开，按她的指示重新整理。

当客人们告辞的时候，凯瑟琳夫人屈尊降贵地祝伊丽莎白和玛丽亚一路平安，并邀请她们明年再到亨斯福德来。德布尔甚至还行了个屈膝礼，伸出手跟她们——握别。





第三十八章


星期六早晨吃饭的时候，伊丽莎白和柯林斯比其他人早到了一会儿。柯林斯趁机向她话别，他认为这种礼节是万万不可少的。“伊丽莎白小姐，”他说道，“承蒙你光临寒舍，不知柯林斯太太是否已向你表达了谢意。不过我敢肯定，你走以前，她一定会向你抒发感激之情。实不相瞒，你能来看望我们，叫我们十分领情。我们自知舍下寒碜，无人乐意光临。我们生活清苦、居室狭小，侍仆寥寥无几，再加之我们见识浅薄，像你这样的一位年轻小姐来到亨斯福德，一定会觉得这儿乏味至极。所以，你这次能赏脸来做客，叫我们结草衔环、感恩不尽。为此，我们竭尽绵薄，使你的日子不至于过得太索然无味。”

伊丽莎白听了，急忙连声道谢，说她的这段时间过得很快活。在六个星期里，她说自己享受到了天伦之乐，夏洛特给了她无穷的情趣和体贴入微的照料，所以表示感谢的应该是她。柯林斯听了十分中意，一边满脸堆起了笑容，一边却又郑重其事地说：

“你说你在这儿日子过得并不算太糟，真叫我高兴到了极点。我们总算尽了自己的一份心意。非常幸运的是，我们能够把你引进高雅的上流社会。亏了同罗辛斯庄园关系亲密，和她们来来往往，才不至于使你待在我们这寒碜的家里感到太单调。因此，我们总算得到了一些安慰，认为你在亨斯福德的日子还不至于无法忍受。我们与凯瑟琳夫人的府上有着这样的关系，这的确是个得天独厚的条件，是别人求之不得的。从此可以看出我们社会地位的高低。你已经看到，我们经常被请去吃饭。老实说，我这所教士住宅虽然简陋不堪、诸多不便，可是来到这里，便可以与我们共享罗辛斯的盛情美意，这不能说不是一种福分。”

他心情激动，欣喜若狂，那快活的劲儿实在难以用语言表达，于是便在屋子里打起了转转。伊丽莎白简简单单说了几句话，既客气又坦诚。

“亲爱的表妹，其实你完全可以把我们的情况转告给哈福德郡的亲人们，我相信你一定办得到。凯瑟琳夫人对柯林斯太太关怀备至、亲切友好，这你每天都可以看见。我觉得，你的朋友并未做出倒霉……不过，话到这里，就最好不要再说下去了。我只是想告诉你，亲爱的伊丽莎白小姐，我衷心祝愿你将来的婚姻也能似我们一样幸福美满。我和亲爱的夏洛特同心同德，无论遇到哪一件事莫不是意气相投，心心相印，活脱脱一对天造地设的夫妻。”

伊丽莎白本来要说，像他们这样的夫妇是十分幸福的，而且还打算用同样诚恳的语气夸赞一下柯府舒适的生活环境，不想话才说到一半，就见他们刚才还议论的柯林斯太太闯了进来，打断了她的话。夏洛特真够可怜的！丢下她跟这种男人朝夕相处，实在让人于心不忍！不过，这桩婚姻可是她自己睁大眼睛选择的，怨不得别人。眼看着客人要走了，她虽然有些难过，但没有半点乞求别人怜悯的意思。她料理家务，帮助丈夫处理教区的杂事和饲养家禽，这桩桩件件的事情都仍然对她具有强大的诱惑力。

马车终于来了，箱子被放到车顶上捆牢，包裹装进了车厢里，一切准备好，光等上路了。两位女友依依惜别之后，由柯林斯送伊丽莎白去上马车。当他们穿过花园的时候，柯林斯千叮咛万嘱咐地托她向她的全家问好。对于去年冬天他在浪搏恩受到的盛情款待，他没齿难忘，一个劲地表示感谢。同时，他还委托伊丽莎白代他问候与他素昧平生的加德纳夫妇。唠叨完之后，他扶伊丽莎白上了车，随即玛丽亚也上了车。就在车门快要关上的时候，他突然慌慌张张地提醒她们说，她们忘了给罗辛斯庄园的那一对母女留句问候的话。

“你们自然非常希望有个人能代你们转达敬意，”他这样说道，“你们在此做客期间，她们待你们恩重如山，所以你们肯定想向她们表示感激。”

伊丽莎白没有表示反对。接着，车门砰地关上了，马车启动了。

两人沉默了一会儿，玛丽亚大声嚷道：“天哪！真像是才来了一两天的时间，可事情倒发生了不少呵！”

“的确不少呵。”她的旅伴嗟叹了一声说。

“咱们在罗辛斯庄园吃了九顿宴席，另外还喝过两回茶！回去后，要讲的事情真是太多啦！”

伊丽莎白心里嘀咕道：“可我要隐瞒的事情也着实不少！”

一路上，她们少言寡语，但也无灾无难。离开亨斯福德不足四个小时，她们就来到了加德纳先生的府上。在这里，她们将耽搁几天的时间。

简气色倒不错，但伊丽莎白寻不到机会研究她的精神状态，因为承蒙舅妈的一片好意，为她们安排了形形色色的活动，忙得她们不亦乐乎。不过，简将随她一道回家。到了浪搏恩，闲时间多了，就可以消消停停地观察简了。

伊丽莎白真想一吐为快，把达西向她求婚的事情告诉简。可她一忍再忍，最后还是决定到了浪搏恩后再摊牌亮相。她非常清楚，此事一经披露，准能让简大吃一惊，同时还可以大大满足她那迄今仍无法从理智上加以克制的虚荣心。她渴望把闷在心里的话讲出去，但拿不准该说到什么地步，又怕一扯到这个话题，难免会把宾利也涉及，这样只能增加姐姐的伤感。





第三十九章


五月份的第二个星期刚到，三位年轻小姐便从格雷斯丘奇街动身，往哈福德郡的某个小镇进发。贝内特先生事先已和她们约好，答应派辆马车到小镇的一家客栈接她们。当小姐们走近这家客栈时，她们立即发现，吉蒂和莉迪亚正从楼上的餐厅探头探脑向外张望，这表明马车已准时来到。这两个姑娘已到了一个多小时，她们一会儿高高兴兴跑到街对面的女帽店闲逛，一会儿对正在站岗的哨兵品头论足，而且还调制了一盘色拉和一盘黄瓜。

向姐姐们致过欢迎词之后，她们得意扬扬摆出了一桌小客栈里常备的冷肉，口里大声嚷嚷道：“这难道不叫人感到高兴吗？你们不觉得意外吗？”

“我们有心请你们大吃一顿，”莉迪亚接着说，“不过，临时得向你们借点钱。因为我们的钱刚才都花到了那家商店里。”说罢，把买来的东西让姐姐们看。“瞧，这顶帽子就是刚才买的。我觉得这帽子不算漂亮，不过买就买了吧。回到家我就把它拆开，然后重新缝制，看效果会不会好一些。”

待姐姐们说这帽子很难看时，她却毫不在乎地说：“嘿！商店里还有两三顶帽子比这还要难看得多哩。等我买点颜色漂亮的缎子把它打扮得像点样子，那时就不会惹人讨厌了。再说，该郡民兵团在两星期内要离开麦里屯，他们一走，夏天穿什么戴什么都关系不大啦。”

“他们真要开走？！”伊丽莎白喜不自禁，由不得叫出了声。

“他们要驻扎到布赖顿附近。我真希望爸爸能带咱们全家到那儿消夏去！这是一个令人神往的计划，花钱肯定不会多。妈妈也一定非常愿意去！你们想想看，咱们要是不到那儿消夏，待在家里准得把人烦死！”

“是呀，”伊丽莎白心想，“那倒真是个挺不赖的计划，马上就会要我们的命。天哪！麦里屯只有一团官兵，而且每月只开一次舞会，就已经把我们搞得晕头转向了，如今怎么顶得住布赖顿整个兵营的兵呢！”

“我有条消息要告诉你们，”待大家在桌旁坐下来后，莉迪亚说道，“你们猜猜看是什么事情？这是一个特大新闻，一条最好最好的消息。我要讲的是咱们大家都十分爱戴的一个人！”

简和伊丽莎白面面相觑，连忙把侍者支走了。莉迪亚见状哈哈大笑，说道：

“唉嗨，你们就是这么小心翼翼，疑神疑鬼，就好像那侍者有多想听似的！其实，他平时听到的事情比我的消息还要叫人吃惊呢。不过，那家伙长得太丑，偎在跟前怪讨厌。我长这么大，还没见过那么长的下巴。好啦，现在听我报告新闻吧。我要讲的是关于亲爱的威克姆的事情，那侍者不配听。威克姆和金小姐结婚的危险已经解除了，你的机会来啦！金小姐到利物浦去找叔叔，再也不回来了。她再也不会干扰威克姆了。”

“金小姐也不会受干扰啦！”伊丽莎白补加了一句，“她摆脱了一桩从财产的角度来讲是冒昧的婚姻。”

“她要是喜欢威克姆而又走开，那才是大傻瓜呢。”

“但愿他们双方的感情都不十分深。”简说道。

“我敢说，威克姆对她的感情不够深。他压根就瞧不上那丫头。谁又会把一个满脸雀斑的丑八怪看在眼里呢？”

伊丽莎白心想，她自己虽说不出如此粗俗的话来，但内心却有过这种粗俗的念头。当时，她还以为自己宽宏大度、心胸开阔呢，想起来真让人吃惊！

大家吃完饭后，两个姐姐付了账，接着就唤人备车。经过一番筹划安排，她们把所有的包裹箱子，连同吉蒂和莉迪亚购置的那些讨厌的东西，一股脑儿全部装上了车。她们也各自寻位子坐到了车厢里。

“这样挤在一起，还真有意思呢，”莉迪亚嚷道，“我很高兴买下了这顶帽子，不过，有了帽子就得再添一只帽盒！好啦，让咱们舒舒服服偎在一起，有说有笑往家走。首先，请你们俩讲讲离家之后都有过什么样的经历。遇见过中意的男人没有？有没有和别人眉来眼去，打情骂俏？我满心希望，你们哪一位能在回来前寻觅到一名夫婿呢。我敢说，简马上就要变成老处女啦。她都快满二十三岁了！老天有眼，我要是二十三岁前还结不了婚，就会羞得无地自容！你们想象不到，菲利普斯姨妈是多么渴望你们能尽快为自己物色到郎君。在她看来，丽茨当初应该把柯林斯要上，而我却认为那样没有一点意思。苍天作证，我恨不得先你们一步嫁出去！这样一来，我就可以领着你们到处去参加舞会。那一天，我们大家聚在福斯特上校家，玩得可真够开心。我和吉蒂当时打算在那儿待一整天，而福斯特太太答应在晚上举办一个小型舞会。顺便提一句，我和福斯特太太可是心贴心的朋友！她当下邀请哈林顿家的两姐妹来参加，可惜哈丽雅特有病，因此佩思只得一个人赶来。你们猜猜，我们都玩了些什么游戏？我们让张伯伦穿上女装，把他打扮成女人的模样。那情形真是滑稽透顶！除了我和吉蒂以及上校夫妇，别的人谁也不知这是场闹剧。当然，这事也瞒不过姨妈，因为有条长礼服就是从她那儿借来的。张伯伦神气活现，你不知装得有多像！丹尼、威克姆、普拉特以及另外两三个人走进屋时，压根儿没认出他来。天哪，简直把我笑得肚子疼！福斯特太太也笑得前仰后合。我当时觉得，自己都快要笑死啦。男人们这才起了疑心，马上便识破了张伯伦的假象。”

莉迪亚在回浪搏恩的路上，净讲她参加各类舞会的情况，同时也说些诙谐幽默的故事，另外还有吉蒂从旁边添油加醋，倒也令大家觉得开心。伊丽莎白虽然心不在焉，没注意她都讲了些什么，但却听见她反复提到威克姆的名字。

回到家中，她们受到了父母极其亲切的接待。贝内特太太见简仍像以前那般美丽多姿，不禁大喜过望。在晚饭桌旁，贝内特先生不由自主地一遍又一遍对伊丽莎白说：

“你回来了，我真高兴，丽茨。”

餐厅里坐满了人，因为卢卡斯家的人差不多全来了，一是迎接玛丽亚，二是听听新闻。大家七嘴八舌地说个不停，接触的话题可谓五花八门。卢太太隔着饭桌问起了玛丽亚，向她打听大女儿的家境以及饲养家禽的情况；贝太太显得格外忙碌，一方面向坐在她下手的简咨询眼下的时装样式，而另一方面又把听到的话传给卢家的几位年轻小姐；莉迪亚把嗓门提得比谁都高，把早晨的趣闻一件件讲给那些爱听的人听。

“太有意思啦，玛丽，”她说道，“我们玩得真是太开心了，你要是同我们一道去就好啦。在去那儿的路上，我和吉蒂放下了所有的车窗，就好像我们乘坐的是一辆空车似的。要不是吉蒂半路晕车，我们会这样一直走到目的地。到了乔治客栈，我们在待人接物上真是无懈可击，请她们三位品尝了天下最可口的冷餐。要是你跟着去了，也可以让你饱饱口福。启程回家的时候，那情景真逗人。我还以为那么多人。一辆马车坐不下呢。直把我笑得死去活来。一路上，大家的高兴劲就别提啦。我们有说有笑，嗓门大得十英里开外的人都能听得到！”

玛丽听后，表情十分严肃地说：“好妹妹，并不是我故意要杀你们的风景，老实讲，你们这些乐趣当然会投合一般女子的口味，可动不了我的心。我倒觉得读书要有趣得多。”

可惜她的这席话，莉迪亚连半句也没听进去。莉迪亚听人讲话一般不超过半分钟，而对玛丽，她连理也不理。

下午的时候，莉迪亚煽风点火，鼓动别的姑娘随她到麦里屯去，看看那边的朋友近况如何。可是，伊丽莎白极力反对，生怕人们蜚短流长，说贝家的小姐沾家还不到半天，就跑去向军官们卖弄风情。她不愿到麦里屯去，还有一条原因，那就是她怕碰见威克姆。她已拿定了主意，准备尽量躲着他。民兵团即将奉命开拔，这个消息使她感到有说不出的快慰。再有两个星期的时间，他们就要离开此地了。她希望他们一走，她就不用再为威克姆烦躁不安了。

她进家门后没有几个小时，便发现父母在反复争论到布赖顿度假的计划，也就是莉迪亚在客栈里提到的那项计划。她看得出，父亲丝毫没有让步的意思，但他的回答却模棱两可。母亲虽碰了几次钉子，却一直不死心，指望着在最后能如愿以偿。





第四十章


伊丽莎白再也耐不住自己的性子，非得把那件事告诉简不可了。最后，她决定把涉及姐姐的地方，都一概不提，即便如此，她认为简听了她的话后也会感到惊讶的。第二天早晨，她把达西向她求婚的那一幕，拣主要的情节讲了出来。

贝内特小姐听罢，起先果真万分惊讶，但很快又觉得不足为奇了，因为她和伊丽莎白姐妹情深，认为不管谁爱上伊丽莎白都是非常自然的。但没过多长时间，她的心里又涌起了一些其他的感情。她为达西感到遗憾，觉得他不该采用那么不合身份的方式倾吐衷情。同时，她也为他感到难过，认为妹妹的拒绝一定给他带来了痛苦。

“他那种自以为是、把求婚的成功视为盘中之餐的态度是万万不可取的，”简说，“更何况他表现得那样露骨，真是错上加错。不过，你的拒绝的确把他推进了绝望的深谷，想起来就让人生恻隐之心！”

伊丽莎白说：“我为他感到十分难过。不过，他的心里存在着许多顾虑，所以他对我的好感很快就会消失得无影无踪。我拒绝了他，你不至于因此而怪罪我吧？”

“怪罪你！噢，不会的。”

“那么，你会怪我当初不该那般夸赞威克姆吧？”

“不——我不知道你那么夸他有什么错。”

“等我把第二天发生的事情告诉了你，你就知道我错在哪里了。”

接着，伊丽莎白便说起那封信来，把涉及乔治·威克姆的内容一下子抖搂了出来。信中列举的事实给了可怜的简迎头一棒。她宁愿尝遍人世间所有的苦难，也不肯相信世界上竟有如此之多的邪恶，何况这些邪恶都集中在一个人身上。达西的一席剖白虽然使她如梦方醒，但却安抚不了她那颗伤透了的心。她竭力想证明这是一场误会，力求洗刷净他们当中一个人的冤屈，而又不至于使另一个人蒙冤受辱。

“这是办不到的，”伊丽莎白说，“你绝对做不到两全其美。他们俩当中你只能选择一个。总共就那么一点点优点，刚够给一个人涂金抹粉。近来，这点优点在他们之间浮来浮去，令人眼花缭乱。对我来说，我比较倾向于达西先生，认为那点优点非他莫属，但你也可以有自己的观点。”

过了好一会儿，简的脸上才勉强露出了笑容。

她说：“我生平最吃惊的事莫过于此。威克姆原来这么坏，实在叫人难以相信。达西先生也真可怜！亲爱的丽茨，你不妨试想一下，他的心里该有多么苦闷。他明明知道你瞧不起他，却又不得不把妹妹的私事讲给你听。痛苦和失望交织在一起，烧灼着他的心。我觉得你应该有所感触。”

“不，我没有任何感触！看到你这般为他惋惜和这般同情他，我反而觉得心安理得了。我知道你会为他主持公道，所以我的态度就变得越来越冷漠。你越是富于同情之心，我就越舍不得怜悯别人。如果你继续为他嗟叹和伤心下去，我就会得到彻底的解脱。”

“可怜的威克姆！瞧他的外表是那么和善，而言谈举止又是那样开通和文雅，想不到却表里不一！”

“他们俩在教养方面显然都各有欠缺之处。一个只是心灵美，而另一个仅仅外表美。”

“你老是觉得达西先生的谈吐和举止不近人情，可我却从未这样看待过他。”

“我无缘无故就不可挽回地讨厌上了他，这我倒觉得是明智之举。这种厌恶情绪，足以激励人的天才，启迪人的智慧。如果你出口便骂人，就讲不出公平合理的话。然而，要是你老是嘲笑人，说不定还能偶尔推出几个妙语警句。”

“丽茨，你第一次读那封信时，你的态度肯定不会像现在这样玩世不恭。”

“是的，你说得一点不错。我当时心里觉得非常不舒服，不舒服到了极点，甚至可以说是十分不快活。我找不到个知己谈谈心里的话，也没有个简在旁边安慰我，说我并不像自己想象的那样懦弱、虚荣和荒唐！唉！在那个时刻，我多么需要你呵！”

“你在达西先生面前谈起威克姆的时候，竟然对达西先生不耐烦，这真是天大的不幸。现在看来，威克姆不配得到你的庇护。”

“确实如此。不过，我虽然对他说了些刻薄的话，造成了遗憾，但那是我长期对他持有偏见的必然结果。有一点，我想征求你的意见。请你告诉我，该不该把威克姆的丑陋本质晓谕天下，让周围的人都了解他的为人？”

贝内特小姐略加思忖，然后答道：“我看没必要把他搞得声名狼藉。你意下如何？”

“我也觉得不必如此。达西先生并没有授权让我把他的话公布于众。相反，凡是与他妹妹有关的情节，他要我绝对保守秘密。至于威克姆其余的行径，即便我讲给别人听，又有谁会相信呢？人们对达西先生成见太深，你要是让他们把他看成一个正人君子，他们当中有一半人死也不会苟同。对此，我实在无计可施。好在威克姆很快就要随军离开此地了，所以他究竟是怎样一个人对当地居民来说关系不大。有朝一日真相总会大白，那时咱们可以讥笑人们孤陋寡闻，笑他们没有早些认清威克姆的本来面目。眼下我先绝口不提。”

“你说得很对。把他的过失公布于众，很可能会毁掉他的一生。现在，他也许对自己的行为正追悔莫及呢，正渴望能洗心革面、重新做人。咱们可不能逼得他走投无路。”

这次谈话之后，伊丽莎白不再心烦意乱，无所适从了。两星期来，她被一大堆秘密压得透不过气，如今总算吐露了两件。她相信，以后要是再谈起这两件事，简一定会洗耳恭听。不过，在这些事情的背后还隐藏着一桩秘密，出于谨慎的缘故，暂且不能透露。她不敢把达西那封信的另一半内容讲出来，也不敢告诉姐姐达西的朋友是如何真心实意爱恋着她。目前，这件事谁都不能让知道。她认为，除非他们双方取得了彻底的谅解，否则绝不能抛出这最后的一条隐秘。她心中暗忖：“简与宾利的和解一旦变为现实，我才能讲出这件秘密，不过到了那时，宾利会亲口把原委告诉简，而且将更为娓娓动听。轮到我畅所欲言、袒露心扉之时，事情已经失去了一切意义！”

回到家安顿下来，她现在有了闲暇观察姐姐的精神状态。简并不快活，她对宾利仍然旧情难忘、爱恋不已。她以前从没有爱过任何人，所以，她的感情和所有初恋的人一样炽烈，而且由于年龄和性格的关系，这种感情比一般的初恋者更为坚贞不移。她痴情地眷恋着宾利，觉得他是天下最出色的男儿。幸亏她富有见识，能照顾亲友们的情绪，才没有沉溺于伤感之中，不然定会毁掉自己的身体，扰乱亲友们内心的平静。

“喂，丽茨，”贝太太有一天对二女儿说，“你怎么看待简悲惨的遭遇？我可是打定了主意，见了谁也不再提及此事了。那天，我跟我的妹妹就这么说过。不过我知道，简到伦敦去，连他的影子也没见上。算啦，他是一个不值得爱的年轻人。简今生今世，恐怕是嫁不成他了。没听说他今年夏天要回尼瑟费德来。凡是有可能了解些内情的人，我都挨个问过了。”

“我看他不会再住尼瑟费德啦。”

“哼，随他的便吧，没人稀罕他来。不管什么时候我都要说，他把我的女儿坑苦了。我要是简，才咽不下这口窝囊气呢。我觉得，简要是因伤心而死于非命，那才叫他为自己的缺德行为后悔不及哩。”

伊丽莎白没有回答，因为这种想入非非的指望，并不能使她得到安慰。

“喂，丽茨，”没过多大工夫，贝妈妈又说了话，“柯林斯两口子把小日子过得挺舒心，是吗？好呀，好呀，但愿他们天长地久。他们家的饭莱怎么样？我敢说，夏洛特是个称职的管家婆。其实，要够得上她妈妈的一半精明，就算节俭的啦。他们在日常生活上，肯定不会大手大脚、铺张浪费。”

“是的，他们一点也不浪费。”

“就凭这一点，他们就可以说是治家有方。是呀，是呀，他们会精打细算，防止出现入不敷出的现象。他们永远也不用为钱伤脑筋。这会对他们大有好处。据我猜想，他们肯定常常谈起等你爸爸去世后，由他们接管浪搏恩的事情。”

“这种话他们不便当着我的面讲。”

“是呀。要是当你的面说这种话，那才是咄咄怪事呢。不过我敢保证，他们一定在背地里常常议论此事。哼，如果他们拿了这笔不义之财能够心安理得，那就由他们去吧。要是让我继承别人的财产，我会觉得脸发烧。”





第四十一章


她们回到家后，转眼之间便过了一个星期，现在已到了第二个星期，也就是民兵团在麦里屯驻扎的最后一个星期。附近的年轻小姐们全都耷拉下了脑袋，几乎到处都可见到沮丧的脸。只有贝家的两位大小姐白天吃得下，夜里睡得香，像平时一样该干什么就干什么。吉蒂和莉迪亚老是责备她们冷酷无情。这两个小姐妹伤心到了极点，竟然无法理解自家的姐姐怎么会有这样的铁石心肠。

“老天爷呀！怎么能让我们活下去呢？我们该怎么办才好呢？”她们动不动就这样悲哀地叫喊。“丽茨，你怎么还笑得出来？”

她们慈祥的母亲也跟着她们伤心抹泪。老人家回首往事，想起了自己在二十五年前，也经历过这样的悲欢离合。

“想当初，米勒上校的军团拔营起寨后，我整整哭了两天。我觉得，我的心都快要碎了。”

“我的心肯定也会碎的，”莉迪亚说。

“要是能跟到布赖顿去，那就好啦！”贝太太说。

“是呀！……如果能那样做，就了了心愿！可惜爸爸太难说话，偏偏要阻挠。”

“洗洗海水澡，保准一辈子不生病。”

“菲利普斯姨妈也说过，洗海水澡对我大有好处。”吉蒂插了一句。

浪搏恩府上时时刻刻都可以听见这样的长吁短叹。伊丽莎白原想借此寻个开心，但她所感到的只是耻辱，没有一丝一毫的欢乐。她又一次感到，达西说她们缺乏教养，实在没有冤枉她们。难怪达西千方百计地阻止自己的朋友跟她们家攀亲结缘。

然而，莉迪亚的忧愁心情不多久便烟消云散了，因为民兵团福斯特上校的太太发出了邀请，让她陪着到布赖顿去。莉迪亚的这位高贵的朋友非常年轻，最近才和上校结了婚。她和莉迪亚气味相投，都是性格奔放、快人快语的乐天派。她们虽然才认识了三个月，却已经做了两个月的知己。

莉迪亚的喜悦心情以及她对福斯特太太的敬慕、贝太太的兴奋和吉蒂的悲伤，此情此景真是难以用语言形容。莉迪亚全然不顾吉蒂的心情如何，只顾自己欢天喜地在屋里东奔西跑，一面让大家为她祝贺，一面说说笑笑，闹得比以往任何时候都凶。而这时，时乖命蹇的吉蒂躲在小客厅里怨天尤人，怒气冲冲地说些不合情理的话。

“我真不明白，福斯特太太为什么光请莉迪亚不请我，”她说，“尽管我和她不是特别要好的朋友，但我和莉迪亚有同样的权利受到邀请，甚至比她的权利还要大，因为我比她大两岁。”

伊丽莎白费尽口舌劝她理智一些，简也劝她想开一些，但都无济于事。要说伊丽莎白本人，她对这次邀请不像妈妈和莉迪亚那样激动万分。她只觉得，莉迪亚即便有一丁点理性的话，在这次事件中也会丧失殆尽。于是，她不由自主地暗地里劝爸爸阻止莉迪亚出游，全然不顾她的这一行径暴露后，将导致什么样的后果。她对爸爸说，莉迪亚历来放浪形骸，而和福斯特太太这种女人交朋友不会给她带来一点好处，跟这样的朋友上布赖顿只会使她的行为更不检点，因为那儿的诱惑肯定大于家中。贝先生用心听她把话讲完，然后说道：

“莉迪亚不到公共场合出出丑，是绝不会死心的。她这次出去亮相，花钱不多，不会给家里添多少麻烦，的确十分难得。”

“莉迪亚在大庭广众面前举止轻浮、行为放荡，害得咱们大家都会跟着她丢人现眼，其实咱们已经在这方面吃了大亏，”伊丽莎白说道。“如果您老人家明察秋毫，就会用截然不同的眼光看待这件事。”

“已经吃了大亏吗？”贝先生问道，“怎么，难道她吓跑了你的恋人？可怜的小丽茨，不要灰心丧气嘛！这么喜欢吹毛求疵的小伙子，连小姑子的一些荒唐行为都容忍不了，失去也不足惋惜。好吧，让我来听听，到底有多少可怜虫让愚蠢的莉迪亚吓得打了退堂鼓。”

“您误解了我的意思。我并没有受到这样的伤害。我抱怨的不是具体哪一种害处，而是多方面的害处。莉迪亚如此放荡不羁，如此无法无天，定会有损于咱们的尊严和体面。请恕我直言，亲爱的爸爸，如果您不当机立断，约束一下她那野里野气的脾性，告诉她情场追逐不能成为终生的职业，要不了多久她便会堕落得无可救药。到了十六岁，她的性格一定型就改不了了。那时，她将成为不折不扣的放荡女人，弄得她自己以及家里人都惹人耻笑。而且，她将是一个最可悲、最下贱的浪女人。她除了年纪轻和有几分姿色，再没有任何魅力。她愚昧无知，思想空虚，一天到晚疯疯颠颠地只知道找恋人，结果到处让人瞧不起。吉蒂也面临这样的危险。她总是跟在莉迪亚的屁股后边打转转。她既贪慕虚荣，又无知懒惰，完全是一副没有教养的样子！唉，亲爱的爸爸！她们俩不管走到哪里，都被人戳脊梁骨，遭人鄙视，连她们的姐姐也跟着丢脸。您难道觉得我这是杞人忧天吗？”

贝内特先生见女儿把这件事看得这么重，便心疼地拉起了她的手，爱抚地说：

“你不必担心，好孩子。凡是了解你和简的人，都敬重你们，看得起你们。你们不会因为有两个——甚至三个傻妹妹，就显得不体面。莉迪亚不到布赖顿去，家中便无宁日。不如任她去吧。福斯特上校是个明白人，不会让她胡作非为。幸好她是个一文不名的穷光蛋，不会成为男人们追逐的目标。到了布赖顿，如果只是个普普通通的浪女人，绝没有在这儿吃香。军官们注意的是比她强的女人。但愿她到了那儿，能够自惭形秽、悬崖勒马。不管怎么说，她再坏也坏不到哪里去了。咱们总不能把她锁起来，让她老死家中。”

听了父亲的回答，伊丽莎白虽然不同意，但也只好作罢。从父亲身边走开时，她既失望又难过。以她这样的性格，不愿意纠缠于琐事而自寻烦恼。她深信自己已尽到了责任，没必要再为那些不可避免的邪恶伤心劳神，也没有必要忧心忡忡增加自己的负担。

莉迪亚和母亲倘若知道了伊丽莎白与父亲的谈话内容，一定会怒从心头起。即使她们两张利口同时夹攻，也泄不尽胸中的怨恨。莉迪亚想入非非，好像布赖顿之行囊括了所有人世间的欢乐。她幻想在那个喜气洋洋的海滨游憩地的街道上，到处都是军官。她仿佛看到，几十名素不相识的军官在争先恐后向她大献殷勤。她还看到了蔚为壮观的军营——一片片帐篷排列有序，里面挤满了血气方刚的年轻小伙子，一个个全都穿着光彩夺目的红制服。更令人陶醉的是，她幻想着自己坐在帐篷里，同时跟至少有六名军官挤眉弄眼，卖弄风情。

她要是知道她的姐姐企图破坏掉这些美景和即将实现的幻想，那叫她如何忍受得了？只有母亲和她心有灵犀，理解她的情。丈夫根本不打算到布赖顿去，这使贝太太怏怏不乐。不过，只要莉迪亚到那儿走一趟，对她也是一种安慰。

好在这母女俩对伊丽莎白的拆台行为一无所知。她们始终都是那样兴高采烈，情绪居高不落，一直持续到莉迪亚离开家门的那一天。

现在，伊丽莎白就要最后一次和威克姆见面了。她回到家之后，常同他有来往，因而烦躁不安的情绪早已消失。以前爱慕他时，伊丽莎白常有一种激动感，而现在这种感觉没有在她身上留下半点痕迹。他曾经风度翩翩，含情脉脉，赢得了她的芳心，而现在她却觉得他行为枯燥乏味，叫人见了就讨厌，就恶心。另外，他目前对她的态度也是她不快的原因之一。他扭捏作态，企图跟她重温旧情，完全耍的是他们初结识时的那一套，岂不知中间经历了那一通变故，这只能惹她生气。她觉得，像他这样一个游手好闲、性格轻薄的公子哥把她作为猎艳的对象就是一种奇耻大辱，于是，她对他最后的一丝感情也荡然无存了。威克姆没有解释他是出于什么缘故才把她冷落了这么长时间，却认为只要他愿意重修旧好，就能满足她的虚荣、再次赢得她的芳心。不料，这却叫伊丽莎白对他越加怨恨。她一忍再忍，才没有骂出声来。

民兵团离开麦里屯的前一天，威克姆和另外几名军官来到浪搏恩吃饯行饭。伊丽莎白压根儿就没打算同他这么和和气气地分手，因此，当他问起她在亨斯福德的那段日子是如何打发时，她有意识地提起了菲茨威廉上校及达西的大名，说他们在罗辛斯庄园做了三个星期的客，并问他是否认识菲茨威廉上校。

威克姆听了，先是诧异，继而不悦，最后大惊失色。不过，他马上便稳定了情绪，笑吟吟地回答说，他以前倒是常见那位上校。他又说上校具有十足的绅士风度，问她对上校的印象如何。伊丽莎白说的当然是些赞誉之词。随即，威克姆又以一种漫不经心的语气问道：

“你刚才说他在罗辛斯庄园待了多久？”

“近三个星期。”。

“你常见他的面吗？”

“是的，几乎天天见他。”

“他的言谈举止与他的表弟大不一样。”

“是的，完全不一样。不过，我觉得了解了达西先生后，对他的印象也就会改善。”

“那可就好啦！”威克姆言不由衷地说，他那副慌张的神情没有逃脱伊丽莎白的眼睛。“这个……我是否能问你个问题？”说到此处，他顿住了话头，换上了一种轻松的口吻，“他在谈吐方面是否有了长进？难道他真的放下了臭架子，一扫平日的傲慢劲儿，变得彬彬有礼了吗？……我实在不敢指望，”他压低嗓门，声调变得严肃了起来，“他能脱胎换骨，改变他的本质。”

“不，那倒不会！”伊丽莎白说，“我觉得他的本质还和从前一样。”

威克姆神情惶惑，不知该为她的话感到高兴还是表示怀疑。她讲话时脸上带着一种高深莫测的表情，诱使他怀着忐忑不安的心情专心致志地朝下听。这时，她又继续说道：

“我说了解达西先生后，对他的印象会有所好转，这并不意味着他的思想和举止臻于完善，而是指在和他处熟之后，你就会进一步了解他的性格。”

威克姆听了这一番言语，不由心惊肉跳，面红耳赤，露出一副惶惶不安的神色，好一会儿一句话也说不出来。直到最后，他才收敛了窘相，转过身来面对着她，用极其温和的声音说：

“你很了解我对达西先生的感情。所以你绝不会怀疑，当听说他端正了自己的行为——即便这只是表面现象——我感到由衷的高兴。在这上面，他的傲慢可能起了些作用，即使对他自己没有裨益，对其他人却大有好处。他正是因为傲慢，才不至于胡作非为，干那种曾经让我吃尽苦头的坏事。怕只怕你所指的他在行为上的检点是做客期间做给姨妈看的。对于他的姨妈，他又敬又怕，总是想方设法给她留下好的印象。据我所知，他在他的姨妈面前老是战战兢兢，多半是因为他一直担心着他和德布尔小姐的婚事，希望促成这桩良缘。”

伊丽莎白听了，不由得笑了笑。但她什么话也没说，只是淡淡地点了下头。她看得出，对方又想老调重弹，企图以自己的伤感换取她的同情，而她却没有兴致成全他。在后半个晚上，他表面上装得和平时一样轻松自在、谈笑风生，可是没有再去向伊丽莎白献殷勤。最后分手时，他们俩都客客气气，但各怀鬼胎——他们也许永远都不想再见到对方了。

酒席散后，莉迪亚随福斯特夫人到麦里屯去了，打算次日清晨从那儿上路。她与家里人辞别时，并没有悲哀的气氛，倒是咋咋呼呼热闹了一场。当时落泪的只有吉蒂一人，但她流的是妒忌的眼泪和苦闷的眼泪。贝太太啰里啰嗦说了一大堆祝女儿幸福的话，又千叮咛万嘱咐地叫她不要错过了及时行乐的机会——这样的嘱咐，莉迪亚自然会不折不扣地照办。末了，莉迪亚满面春风地高呼再见，一点也没听见姐姐们细声细气的送别话。





第四十二章


伊丽莎白如果仅仅根据自家的情况去评论婚姻家庭，那么她所得出的结论肯定不会太乐观。她父亲当年由于贪恋青春美貌，贪恋年轻漂亮的人一般都具备的快乐的天性，糊里糊涂娶了一个智力贫乏而又心胸狭窄的女人。结过婚后不久，他便心灰意冷，不再以真情待她了。夫妻之间的相互敬重和相互信任，消失得无影无踪；他对家庭幸福的期待，却原来是南柯一梦。世上有许多人在头脑发昏的情况下做出了荒唐事后，便恣意寻欢作乐以排遣胸中的失落感，而贝内特先生没有颓废，没有以这种方式寻求精神的慰藉。他喜欢欣赏乡村的景色，并酷爱读书，这些嗜好成了他的主要乐趣。他的妻子除了做些幼稚而愚蠢的事引他开心之外，再没有给过他半点情意。作为男人来说，一般都不愿从自己的妻子身上寻求这种乐趣；然而，在无法进行其他形式的娱乐时，身处逆境的达观者定会充分利用已有的条件。

伊丽莎白看穿了父亲的鬼把戏，认为他不是一个称职的丈夫。每每想到这一点，她就感到痛苦万分。然而，她崇拜他的才智，又感激他对她的宠爱，于是她竭力想忘掉那些无法忽视的怪现象，尽量不去思考他的失职失体的举动。正是他在中间作怪，才使得他的妻子受到自己孩子的蔑视，真是太不应该。对于不美满的婚姻给子女们带来的不利影响，伊丽莎白从未像现在体验得这么深刻，而对于父亲滥用他的聪明才智造成的种种害处，她也从未像现在看得这么透。父亲的才智如果发挥得当，即便不能开阔母亲的眼界，起码也可以维护女儿们的体面。

威克姆走后，伊丽莎白曾经高兴了一阵，但民兵团的调离再没有其他让她满意的地方了。外边的宴会不像从前那样丰富多彩了，在家里一天到晚总听到母亲和妹妹抱怨生活过于单调，给全家人的心头罩上了一层阴影。吉蒂早晚都会恢复理智，因为把她搅得心猿意马的那班人已经开到了别处。叫伊丽莎白操心的是另外一个妹妹——那孩子品性本来就不好，而现在置身于海滨浴场和军营之中，更是危险重重，很可能加倍地放荡，做出更蠢的事来。从整体来说，她发现（以前她也经常这样认为），眼巴巴一直盼望的事情一旦发生，所产生的结果不一定随她的心愿。因此，她只好指望着将来的某一天能如愿以偿，并找些其他的事情寄托自己的愿望，再次沉醉于期待之中，暂时安慰一下自己，准备重新经受失望的痛苦。眼下她所朝思暮想的快活事儿是到湖区旅游。当母亲和吉蒂遇到不顺心的事情，把家里搅得鸡犬不宁时，对于旅游的期待成了她最大的慰藉。她觉得，如果简也能和她一道去湖区玩，那就再好不过了。

她心里想到：“我还算幸运，总还可以对某件事情存些指望。假如一切都安排得圆圆满满、滴水不漏，我反而会感到失望。这次姐姐不能前往，使我时时刻刻都觉得遗憾，可这样一来，我才有可能实现自己快乐的梦想。一项面面俱到的计划往往会半路流产。一般来说，只有稍微忍受一些烦恼，才不至于导致失望的结局。”

莉迪亚离家之际，曾答应常给母亲和吉蒂写信，把她的见闻详详细细讲给她们听。可是，家里盼星星盼月亮好不容易才能等到一封信，而且总是短得可怜。她告诉妈妈的事情无非是：她们由某某军官相陪去了图书馆，在那里看到的室内用品简直美得让人见了着迷；她新买了一件长礼服和一把遮阳伞，本想花些笔墨详尽形容形容，怎奈福斯特太太唤她到军营去，只得仓促搁笔。从她给吉蒂的信中，能了解的内容就更少了，因为这些信虽然写得很长，但里边讲的净是不能公开的私房话。

她出门两三个星期后，家里又开始出现了生机勃勃、喜气洋洋的景象，周围的一切都沉浸在欢乐的气氛之中。进城越冬的人家纷纷回归故里，穿起夏季鲜艳的服装，忙忙碌碌地为消暑做准备。贝太太的心情又恢复了平静，只是不高兴的时候爱发几句牢骚。到了六月中旬，吉蒂也恢复了常态，到麦里屯去脸上不再挂泪花了。伊丽莎白看在眼里，喜在心头，满指望她到了圣诞节时可以变得理智些，不至于每天把军官们挂在嘴边。不过，要是陆军部存心干伤天害理的事，再派一团官兵来麦里屯驻扎，她的希望就会落空。

她们原定的到北方旅行的日期已经临近，只剩下两个星期的时间了。不巧加德纳太太来了封信，立刻便拖延了行期，连旅行的范围也不得不缩小。她说加德纳先生有事不得脱身，只好把出发的日期向后推两个星期，暂定在七月份，而且他在一个月后必须赶回伦敦。这样，时间一缩短，就不能到远处去了，不能像原来所规划的那样纵情游览了，至少不能像以前所期望的那样悠然自得地旅行了。照现在的计划，她们只好忍痛割爱，放弃湖区览胜的设想，缩短旅程，最远不能超过德比郡。德比郡有不少可供观赏的景致，足够她们游览三个星期的了。加德纳太太曾在那儿住过几年，而今旧地重游，计划在那儿盘桓数日，实在叫她心驰神往、飘然若仙。她急切地想再看看昔日的景物，就像她急于游览马特洛克[1]、查茨沃思[2]、达沃河谷[3]和皮克峰[4]等风景名胜一样。

伊丽莎白失望到了极点。她一心一意要到湖区游览，现在仍觉得时间较为充裕，能够满足这个心愿。不过，她觉得不能不知足，再说她的个性开朗明快，因此没过多久她就又有说有笑了。

一提起德比郡之行，便勾起她许多的联想。看到这个地名，她不可能不想到彭伯里以及彭伯里的主人。她曾这样夸口说：“我可以神不知鬼不觉地溜进他的故乡，偷他几块透明的水晶石[5]，给他个防不胜防。”

出发前的等待时间现在延长了一倍。舅父和舅母要在四个星期之后，才会姗姗而来。不过，这段时期总算熬过去了，加德纳夫妇带着他们的四个孩子最后终于来到了浪搏恩。四个孩子中间有两个小姑娘，一个六岁，一个八岁，而另外的两个是她们的小弟弟。他们都要留在浪搏恩，由他们的表姐简负责照管。他们都喜欢简，因为简办事有耐心，性格温和，无论从哪一方面讲都非常合他们的心意。她真心爱他们，教他们识文断字，而且还陪他们一道玩耍。

加德纳夫妇在浪搏恩只住了一夜，第二天早晨就带着伊丽莎白出发上路，去探新猎奇、游山逛水了。他们是些非常对口味的旅伴，所以路上自有一番乐趣。他们一个个身体健康、性格随和，可以忍受旅途上的诸多不便；他们兴致勃勃，可以保持愉快的气氛；他们相互体贴，个个聪明能干，出门在外遇到扫兴的事情时，可以齐心协力、共渡难关。

本书不打算详细描写德比郡的风光，至于他们的旅程所必须经过的一些名胜地区，例如牛津、布莱尼姆[6]、瓦威克[7]、凯内尔沃思[8]、伯明翰等等，世人都知道得多了，所以也不打算付诸于笔端。现在要讲的是德比郡的一个弹丸之地。且说有个小镇名叫兰顿，加德纳太太以前曾在那儿居住过。她方才打听到昔日的一些老熟人依然留居故土，于是，在参观完德比郡的主要景观之后，便绕道去探望他们。伊丽莎白听舅妈说，彭伯里距兰顿不足五英里，虽然不在必经之路上，可是要去也多走不了多少路。头天晚上讨论行进路线时，加德纳太太提出想到彭伯里再看看，她丈夫欣然同意。接下来，两人便征求伊丽莎白的意见。

“亲爱的，你愿意不愿意去参观一个你常听人提起的地方？”加德纳舅妈问，“你的许多朋友都和那儿有着千丝万缕的联系。要知道，威克姆的童年就是在那儿度过的。”

伊丽莎白的兴致不高，觉得自己无心到彭伯里游玩，于是便直说她不想去。她声称她已厌倦于深宅大院，因为路上看得太多了，而且也不稀罕绣毡锦帏。

加德纳太太骂她傻。“如果光是一幢富丽堂皇的房子，我也不稀罕赶老远去瞧，”她说，“关键是那儿的景色着实迷人。那儿的树林算得上是全国顶顶美丽的。”

伊丽莎白嘴上没再反对，但心里仍一百个不愿意。到那里去游览，很可能会碰上达西先生。到那时，事情就糟啦！她一想到此处便羞红了脸，心想与其担这么大的风险，倒不如开诚布公跟舅妈说个明白。怕只怕这样做也有许多不便之处。到了最后，她拿定主意先在暗中打听一下主人是否在家。如果得到的回答是主人在家，再走这最后的一着棋也不迟。

于是，夜里临睡的时候，她便向女服务员打听彭伯里那地方好不好，主人姓甚名谁，又提心吊胆问起主人家是否要回来消夏。她这最后一问，得到的是让她喜出望外的否定回答。恐惧心情打消了，她在悠闲之中又产生了强烈的好奇心，想去亲眼看看那庄园。第二天早晨又扯起这个话题时，舅妈再次征求她的意见。这一回，她摆出一副无所谓的样子，没加犹豫便说她对这项计划其实并不反感。于是，他们当下决定到彭伯里去。

第四十三章


马车一直朝前驶去。伊丽莎白远远望见彭伯里的树林时，心里便打起了小鼓。最后驶进庄园时，她越发感到心慌意乱。

庄园很大，只见里边高阜低洼，气象万千。他们拣一处最低的地方进了庄园，坐着马车在辽阔、美丽的树林里走了许久。

伊丽莎白浮想联翩，无心和人交谈，但每看到一处别致的景观，她都要发出由衷的赞叹。马车沿山路徐徐向上攀爬，走了约有半英里之后，来到了高山之巅。树林到此处戛然而止，彭伯里府邸顿时映入眼帘。那府邸坐落在山谷那边，谷中有一条起伏的小道蜿蜒曲折向外伸展。那是一座气势磅礴、美丽多姿的石头建筑，屹立在一片高地上，背靠一道树木葱茏的山岗。那石头房子的门前，流淌着一条水势逐渐变大的小河。这是一股颇具自然情趣的湍流，显不出一丝一毫矫揉造作的痕迹。两岸点缀得既活泼又质朴，让伊丽莎白看了流连忘返。她从未遇见过如此富于大自然魅力的地方，那天然美姿一点没有遭受到庸俗趣味的玷污。大家激动地连声称赞。此时此刻，伊丽莎白觉得在彭伯里当个主妇也许是件挺不错的事。

马车滑下山坡，穿过小桥，一直驶到彭府的大门前。伊丽莎白从近处打量着那深宅大院，心里不免又发了毛，生怕撞上这儿的主人。她担心那女服务员把情况搞错了。当他们一行要求参观住宅时，被领进了客厅里。趁等候女管家之际，伊丽莎白才有了时间细想，她不知自己怎么跑到了这种地方。

女管家来了。她是个仪态端庄的老妇人，虽然远不如伊丽莎白想象的那么典雅，但却极端热情。她领着大家走进了餐厅。这是一间结构匀称的大房子，布置得华美别致。伊丽莎白稍许把四周打量了一下，然后走到窗前欣赏外边的景色。但见他们刚走下来的那座山丘上林木葱郁，从远处望去显得越发陡峭挺拔，形成了一种美丽的景观。这里的一草一木都是如此清新爽目。她极目远眺，纵观全景，看到了那道河流，看到了散布在两岸上的树木以及蜿蜒的山谷，不由感到心旷神怡。走进其他房间观看，这些景物就变化了姿态。但不管从哪个窗口瞭望，都自有秀色可餐。彭府的房间一个个宽敞美观，里面的陈设和主人的身份颇为相称，既不俗气，又不过分的奢侈，和罗辛斯庄园相比，算得上是豪华不足、风雅有余。伊丽莎白看了，十分佩服主人的情趣。

她心中暗忖：“我差点就成了这儿的女主人！如果是那样，这些房间我早该摸得滚瓜烂熟了！我不应该是作为生人来参观，而应该把此处视为自己的财产，欢迎舅父和舅母来做客……可是……”她停止了胡思乱想，“这是万万行不通的。那时我恐怕连舅父舅母的面也见不上了，因为我丈夫不会允许我请他们来。”

她幸亏省悟到了这一点，才没有为过去而懊悔。

她很想问问女管家，看她的主人是不是真的不在家，可惜没有勇气开口。不过，这个问题后来倒是由舅父提了出来，惊得她急忙转过了身去。雷诺兹太太回答说主人的确不在家，接着又添了一句：“不过，明天他就回来，还要带回家一大群朋友。”伊丽莎白暗暗感到庆幸，因为他们路上没耽误一天，来得正是时候！

此刻，舅妈喊她去看一幅画像。她走到跟前，看到那是威克姆的肖像，和另外几幅小型画像一道挂在壁炉上方。舅母笑嘻嘻地问她是否喜欢威克姆的像。女管家走上前来说，画像上的小伙子是前管家的儿子，由已故的老主人一手供养大。“这个小伙子现在到军队里去了，”她补充说道，“不过，他怕是变野了。”

加德纳太太满脸带笑地望了望外甥女，但伊丽莎白却没有理会她。

“而那一位，”雷诺兹太太说着话，用手把另一幅画像指了指，“就是我的主人……画得惟妙惟肖，非常逼真，和那一幅完成于同一时间，差不多都有八年了。”

“我常常听人说你主人是堂堂一表人才，”加德纳太太用眼睛打量着画像说，“瞧那脸蛋有多英俊。丽茨，你可以告诉我们，他长得到底是不是这个模样。”

雷诺兹太太一听说伊丽莎白认识她的主人，不由对她肃然起敬。

“这位年轻小姐认识达西先生？”

伊丽莎白飞红了脸，连忙支吾道：“和他是泛泛之交。”

“他风度翩翩、英俊潇洒，你说对吗，小姐？”

“是的，他长得是很漂亮。”

“说真的，我还从没见过这么标致的人呢。楼上还有他一幅画像，比这幅大，也比这幅画得好。老主人生前最喜欢这间屋子，也非常喜欢这些画像，所以这儿的东西都原封未动，放在老地方。”

伊丽莎白听了这话，才明白威克姆的画像为什么也挂在这里。

接下来，雷诺兹太太又指给他们看达西小姐的一幅画像，那还是她八岁时请人画的。

“达西小姐是不是和她的哥哥一样模样儿出众？”加德纳太太问。

“可不是么！她是百里挑一的人尖尖，而且多才多艺！她一天到晚又弹琴又练歌。隔壁房间里就摆着一架新买的钢琴，那是我的主人送给她的礼物。他们兄妹俩明日一块回来。”

加德纳太太为人和蔼可亲，不断提些问题并发表些评论，鼓励她朝下讲。而雷诺兹太太不知是出于自豪感还是出于对主人家的一片爱心，说起主人兄妹俩的事情便眉飞色舞。

“你家主人每年都要在彭伯里庄园住很长时间吧？”加德纳先生问。

“没有我所期望的那么长，先生。不过，我敢说他的一半时间是在这里度过，而达西小姐常在夏天来此处消暑。”

“可是，她有时也到拉姆斯盖特去消暑。”伊丽莎白在心里嘀咕了一句。

“你家主人要是结了婚，你就可以有更多的机会见到他了。”

“这倒是真的，先生。不过，我不知什么时候能喝上他的喜酒，也不知道哪位姑娘可以配得上他。”

加德纳夫妇听了，不由都笑了起来。伊丽莎白情不自禁地说道：“你的这种观点，实在给他脸上增添不少光彩。”

“我讲的全是真话，凡是了解他的人都会这么说。”女管家解释道，伊丽莎白觉得她的话有些言过其实。但是在听下边的一句话时，她就越发感到诧异了。“他四岁的时候我就来到了府上，从未听他说过一句气人的话。”

伊丽莎白觉得她的夸奖有些耸人听闻，与自己的看法迥然两样。她一向都坚定不移地认为，达西不是个性情和善的人。于是乎，她兴趣盎然，很想听听女管家的下文。这时，幸喜她的舅舅开口说道：

“值得如此称道的人，的确寥寥无几。你真是交了好运，碰到这样一位主人。”

“是的，先生，我的运气是不错。就是走遍全世界，也找不到第二个这样的好人。我常对人讲，小时候与人为善，长大了定会宽厚仁慈。我的主人自小就是天下性情最温和、心眼最实在的孩子。”

伊丽莎白几乎睁圆了双眼，心里想到：“这难道会是达西先生吗？”

“他的父亲就是一个难得的好人。”

“对，太太，你说得一点不错。有其父必有其子，我们的小主人对待穷人也是那么亲切和善。”

伊丽莎白越听越感到惊奇，心里的疑云便越重，于是急巴巴地想继续听下去。雷诺兹太太随便讲起任何别的事情都提不起她的兴趣。她谈到画像、房屋的面积以及家具的价格，结果都是对牛弹琴。加德纳先生认为，雷诺兹太太所以要过甚其词地夸赞主人，无非是出于家人的偏见，因此觉得很有趣，马上又引到了这个话题上。当大伙儿攀爬长长的楼梯时，雷诺兹太太又津津乐道地摆起了主人的诸多优点。

“他是天下最杰出的地主，也是一名最出类拔萃的主人。”她说，“提起他，没有一个佃户，没有一个仆人不伸大拇指的。有些人说他傲慢，但我却看不出他有任何傲慢的地方。依我看，他只是不像其他年轻人那样喜欢夸夸其谈罢啦。”

“经她这么一说，岂不是把他粉饰成了圣人？”伊丽莎白心想。

“这样夸奖他，可与他对咱们那位可怜朋友的态度格格不入呀。”舅妈边走，边小声说道。

“也许咱们错怪了人家。”

“这不大可能，因为咱们的消息来源可是相当可靠的呀.、”

大家来到楼上宽敞的走廊里，即刻被领进了一间漂亮的客厅里。这儿像是最近才装饰过，比楼下的房间更优雅，更明快。据说，达西小姐去年回彭伯里来，看中了这间屋子，现在精心布置好，就是为了供她享用。

“他的确是个好哥哥。”伊丽莎白一面说，一面朝一扇窗户走去。

雷诺兹太太预料说，达西小姐只要一跨入这间屋子，定会喜不自胜。随后，她又补充道：“达西先生总是这样，凡是能使妹妹高兴的事，他说办就办。为了自己的妹妹，他赴汤蹈火都在所不辞。”

下来要参观的只有画廊和两三套大卧室了。画廊里陈列着许多油画佳作，只可惜伊丽莎白对绘画一窍不通。方才在楼下欣赏画时，她最喜欢看的是达西小姐画的几幅蜡笔画，因为这种画的题材通常比较有趣，也比较容易看懂。

画廊里挂着不少家族画像，但这类玩意儿对生人并不具备多少吸引力。伊丽莎白只顾朝前走，一心寻找那张她唯一能认得出特征的面孔。哈，终于找到啦……她觉得那副面孔和达西先生像极了。记得达西先生在打量她时，脸上时常也挂着这种微笑。她在画像前伫立良久，看得出了神，后来临出画廊前，又拐回来看了一会儿。雷诺兹太太告诉客人们，达西的这幅画像还是他父亲在世时绘制的。

此刻，伊丽莎白对画中人油然产生了一股温情。即便他们接触最频繁的时候，她也不曾有过这种感觉。雷诺兹太太那样称赞他，意义非同小可。什么样的称赞比一个聪明用人的称赞能够更有价值呢？伊丽莎白觉得，达西作为一名兄长、庄园的主人以及一府之尊该掌握着多少人的命运呵！他的一举手一投足，就可以给人带来无穷的欢乐，也可以造成巨大的痛苦！他既能广施德善，又可作恶多端！女管家所讲的事情，没有一件不表明他的品格优良。伊丽莎白伫立在他的画像前，只见他双眼注视着她，倏忽间想起了他的一片痴情，心中不由泛起了一股从未有过的感激之情。一想起他那种倾心劲儿，她就不再去斤斤计较他求婚时所说的那些伤人心的话了。

府内凡是可以公开参观的地方，都参观过了。客人们下得楼来，和女管家依依辞别。女管家在大厅门口把他们托付给园丁，由他领着出去。

当他们穿过草坪向河边行走时，伊丽莎白回过身又望了望彭府，引得舅父和舅母也留住了脚步。正当舅父估摸石头房子的兴建年代时，不料突然看见那房子的主人从房子后边的一条通往马厩的小路上走了过来。

他们相距不足二十码，而且达西出现得太突如其来，叫伊丽莎白想躲都躲不及。他们四目相撞，两张面孔都涨得绯红。达西吃惊不小，一时愣在那里一动不动。但他很快醒过神来，迎上去和伊丽莎白搭腔。他的语气即使不算十分镇定，至少也可以说是十分有礼貌。

伊丽莎白早已不由自主地转身想走，但见他主动迎上来，便又立定了脚步，带着压抑不住的窘迫神情接受他的问候。舅父和舅母以前从没有见过他，即使觉得他和刚才参观过的画像十分相像，也不敢断定他就是达西先生。但是，园丁看到主人时的那副诧异样子，让他们一瞧便心里明白了。夫妇俩在他和伊丽莎白谈话时，远远地站在一旁。达西客客气气向伊丽莎白问候起了她家里的情况，而伊丽莎白又惊慌又迷乱，几乎都不敢抬起眼睛瞧他的脸，也不清楚自己都说了些什么话。她感到奇怪，觉得自他们上次分手以来，达西的言谈举止发生了很大的变化，所以他每讲一句话都使她增加一分窘迫感。她心里左思右想，觉得自己闯到这里来被人家撞了个正着，真是丢人败兴。这短短的几分钟，竟成了她一生中最难挨的时刻。达西也不见得比她有多安然，说话时，平时的那种从容不迫的声调已荡然无存。他问她几时从浪搏恩出发，在德比郡待了多久，诸如此类的话问了又问，而且显得慌里慌张，这充分说明他的心里已成了一团乱麻。

最后，他好像再也想不出什么话可说了，于是便默默无语地静立了一会儿，又突然定了定神，告辞走开了。

舅父舅母这才来到了她身边，夸赞达西长得相貌堂堂、一表人才。但伊丽莎白满腹心事，一个字也没听进去，只顾闷头不响地跟着他们走。羞耻和懊恼使她忘掉了一切。她这次到这儿来，真是天下最倒霉、最失算的事！他一定会为此百思而不得其解。像他这么傲慢的人，要是不把她看成一个可耻的女人，那才怪呢！让人觉得，她像是死皮赖脸送上门的！唉，她真不该到这儿来呀！可他为什么偏偏要提前一天突然回来呢？他们哪怕早走十分钟，也不会这样和他撞个满怀了。显而易见，他是刚刚到达的，刚刚下马，或者刚刚下车。想起方才二人相撞时那种尴尬样，她的脸就一阵阵泛红。他的态度与以前大不一样——这是怎么回事呢？料不到他居然还跟她说话，这真是叫人感到惊奇！……更何况他礼貌周全，竟还关心起了她家里的人！这次意外相遇，他的态度如此谦恭，谈吐如此温存，这可是她前所未闻的。与他在罗辛斯庄园把信递给她时说话的态度相形之下，这该是一个多么鲜明的对照呵！她想来想去还是想不通，琢磨不出个原因来。

说话间，他们一行已上了河边的一条美丽的小径。越往前走，地势便越低洼，景色更加引人入胜，树林也益发妩媚多姿。可是，伊丽莎白耽于沉思，久久没有留意到这些绮丽景观。一路上，舅父和舅母一再招呼她看这看那，而她只是随口胡乱答应一声，用眼睛扫扫他们所指的景物，实际上什么也分辨不清。她一心只想着彭伯里府邸，想象着达西此刻有可能在府内的哪个房间。她真想知道他此时此刻的心情以及他对她的看法。他难道能够原谅所有的一切，依然钟情于她吗？也许，他内心平静如水，才对她那么礼致彬彬，不过他的声音倒是有些异常，显露出了情绪的不安。她不知道他见了她是痛苦多于欢乐，还是欢乐多于痛苦，可是看他那副样子，不像是心静神宁。

后来，舅父舅母怪她心不在焉，这才使她回过神来，觉得有必要恢复平日的镇静。

他们进入了树林，暂时离开小河，登上了山坡。透过林木的间隙，可以纵目远眺，望见婀娜多姿的峡谷、对面令人心醉神迷的群山、满山遍野的树林以及时隐时现的小河。加德纳先生游兴大发，提出要绕着庄园走走，但又怕徒步走不了那许多路。园丁得意地笑了笑，告诉他们说围着庄园兜一圈得走十英里的路。此事只好作罢。他们还是沿着常规路线继续前行。大家游游逛逛，顺陡峭的林坡走下去，又到了河边，这儿的河道十分狭窄。他们从一简陋的小桥上过了河，只见这座小桥与周围的景色很是协调。此处百物天成，比他们参观过的哪一个地方都素雅。山谷到了这儿也变成了一道狭缝，刚刚容得下一泓清水和一条掩隐在灌木丛中的羊肠小道。伊丽莎白很想循着曲径去寻幽探胜。可是在过了小桥之后，眼见离彭府越来越远。加德纳太太不善于走路，这时再也走不动了，只求尽快回到马车上。伊丽莎白只得依了她。于是，大家抄近路向河对岸的彭伯里府邸走去。只可惜他们行进的速度非常缓慢，那是因为加德纳先生平素虽然喜欢钓鱼，但很少能够尽兴，所以现在看到河水里不时有鳟鱼出现，就和园丁谈起了钓鱼的情趣，脚下老是停滞不前。大家就这么慢悠悠地溜达着，谁想竟看到达西朝他们走了过来，并且已离得不远了。这叫他们又一次感到意外，而伊丽莎白的惊愕程度一点不次于方才见到他时。这边的小路旁没有河对岸的树木多，因而未及相遇便能瞧得见他。伊丽莎白虽然吃惊不小，但起码不至于像上次见面时那般措手不及。她心想，如果他真的是冲着他们来的，她一定得做出泰然自若的样子，和他讲话万万不能慌张。在短短的几分钟里，她一度觉得他很可能会拐到另一条小路上。当他的身影隐没在一个转弯处的时候，她仍然抱着这种想法。但是刚一过了转弯处，他便出现在了他们的眼前。她一眼就看得出，他还是像刚才那样彬彬有礼。于是，她依照着他的客气劲儿，把这儿的美景夸赞了一番。但是，刚用了几个“妩媚”、“迷人”这样的字眼，心里便产生了一个叫人不高兴的念头。她觉得这样赞美彭伯里庄园，说不定会引起对方的曲解。想到这里，她脸一红，再也不说什么了。

加德纳太太此刻站在后边不远的地方。达西见伊丽莎白沉默了下来，便求她赏个脸，给他介绍一下她的朋友。他这样讲究礼节，这倒叫伊丽莎白始料不及。想当初他向她求婚时，傲气十足地还揶揄她的这些亲戚呢，现在却要和人家套近乎，这实在让她忍俊不禁。她心想：“他看花了眼，错把他们当成了上流人。要是知道了他们的身份，他还不清楚有多惊奇哩。”

不过她还是为他作了介绍。她一面解释眼前的这两位跟她的关系，一边偷偷瞟了他一眼，看看他有何反响。她以为他会借故逃开，远离她的这些粗俗的亲戚。达西听后的确吃了一惊，但是却没有掉头走开，而是陪着他们回去，还和加德纳先生攀谈了起来。伊丽莎白自然是又高兴，又得意。真是大快人心！也让他知道知道，她的有些亲属并不是那么叫人害臊。她全神贯注地听两位男人交谈，很为舅父感到自豪，因为他的每个表情、每一句话都充分显示出他智慧超人、情趣高雅，并且举止得体。

当两人的话题扯到钓鱼上时，她听到达西十分客气地邀请舅父来垂钓，说他在附近逗留期间，随时都可以回到这儿来。同时，他还提出要借钓具给舅父，并指给他看河里哪个地方鱼最多。和伊丽莎白挽手并行的加德纳太太，惊奇地向她丢了个眼色。伊丽莎白没有出声，但心里却非常得意，觉得达西所以这样慷慨盛情，一定都是为了取悦她。不过，她还是感到极端惊愕，一遍遍地问自己：“他为什么一反常态呢？这到底是出于什么原因呢？他不见得是为了我吧……不见得是为了我才把态度放得如此温和。绝不会是因为我在亨斯福德把他臭骂了一顿，他才换上了这种态度。他不可能还爱着我。”

他们就这样两个女的在前，两个男的断后，走了好一段路。后来，他们顺坡走到了河边，欣赏一些稀奇的水生植物。等到回到原来的路上时，他们的位置出现了些变化。加德纳太太走了一早上的路，感到周身疲倦，觉得伊丽莎白的手臂架不住她的重量，于是提出和丈夫一道行走。达西取代了她的位置，同她的外甥女并行。两位青年男女沉默了一会儿，最后还是伊丽莎白开口讲了话。她想让他知道，她是调查清楚他不在家后，才来到了这儿参观。于是，她一开始就指出，他回来得太突然，叫人感到意外。她强调说：“你的管家告诉我们说，你明天方能到家。我们离开贝克韦尔前，就听说你不会马上到乡下来。”达西承认这些都是事实，说他是找账房有急事才比他的旅伴们先到了几个小时。接下来他又说道，“那些人明天一大早就来同我会合。他们当中有几个是你的老熟人——宾利先生及其姐姐妹妹。”

伊丽莎白听罢，只是稍微点了一下头。她不由立时想起他们俩上一次提到宾利时的情形。从达西的脸色看来，他心里也在回忆同一情形。

“在那一行人当中还有一个人，”停了一会儿，他接着说道，“她特别想和你认识。你在兰顿期间，请允许我介绍舍妹与你相识。不知这个要求是否太过分啦？”

这项请求着实让伊丽莎白感到意外。她一时慌了神，都不知自己是怎么答应下来的。她立刻想到，达西小姐这么急切要与她结识，一定是受了哥哥的唆使。意识到这一点，她感到非常满意。原来，达西虽然生了些气，但不计前嫌，仍对她有好感。

他们默默地向前走去，各自想着心事。伊丽莎白有些不安，觉得这事太让人不可思议，不过她又为之感到得意和高兴。达西希望能把自己的妹妹介绍给她，这可是给了她天大的面子。二人不知不觉把加德纳夫妇远远甩到了后边。待他们来到马车旁时，那两口子离他们还有好长一截路呢。

达西请她进府内歇歇，而她却说自己不累。于是，他们只好原地不动站在草坪上。在这种时候，沉默最叫人尴尬，所以应该多找点话说。伊丽莎白想打破沉默，但又苦于找不出话题来。后来她灵机一动，想起她是旅游的，于是和他东拉西扯谈起了马特洛克以及达沃河谷的景观。糟糕的是，时间流逝得太缓慢，舅妈走路也过于从容，谈话还未结束，伊丽莎白就几乎想不出词来了，使得她心急如火。待加德纳夫妇走到跟前，达西请大家到府内用些茶点，可客人们婉言谢绝了。于是，他们极有礼貌地分了手。达西扶两位女士登上马车，接着马车就徐徐启动了。伊丽莎白从车上看见他迈着缓慢的步子走进府去。

这下，舅父和舅妈开始评长论短了。两人都说达西超尘脱俗，比他们想象的好上一百倍。“他举止十分得体，待人礼貌周全，而且一点儿也没有架子。”舅父说。

舅妈接着说：“他实实在在有点高贵的味儿，但只是表现在风度上，并没有什么不得体的。我现在赞同那女管家的看法，即便有些人觉得他傲慢自大，我却看不出什么蛛丝马迹来。”

“我怎么也没料到他对咱们竟然这么好，不仅仅非常客气，而且简直可以说是十分殷勤。其实，他没必要那么殷勤，因为他和伊丽莎白只不过是泛泛之交。”

“老实讲，丽茨，”舅妈说，“论相貌他赶不上威克姆，不过他也眉清目秀，长得十分端庄。你怎么对我说，他是个见了就让人生厌的家伙呢？”

伊丽莎白竭力为自己辩解，说她以前有这种看法，但和他在肯特郡重逢时就对他产生了好感，而今天早晨觉得他简直和蔼可亲到了极点。

“他客气是客气，只是有点心血来潮，”舅父说，“一般的贵人都是这样。所以，他请我来钓鱼，我却没把他的话当真。也许他改天又会变卦，把我赶出他的领地。”

伊丽莎白认为他们完全误解了他的品格，但却没有说出口。

“从看到的情况分析，”加德纳太太继续说道，“我真想不到他竟会干伤天害理的事，就像他对待威克姆那样。他不像是个心毒手狠的人。相反，他说话时，嘴角老浮游着一种和善的东西。他的外表具备高贵的气质，一看就知道他心肠不会坏。不过，那位领着咱们参观的女管家可就把他吹得太神乎其神了！有几次我都差点忍不住笑出声。我想他是个乐善好施的主人，在用人的眼中这就体现了一切美德。”

这时，伊丽莎白觉得自己有责任为达西洗冤昭雪，把他和威克姆之间的事情解释一下。接下来，她就尽量采取一种谨慎的态度，一五一十地讲了起来。她说，她在肯特郡听了他的亲戚一席话，认为他的行为与人们传说的大相径庭。他的品格决非像哈福德郡的人们所说的那么一无是处，威克姆也没有那样善良可敬。为了证实这一点，伊丽莎白详详细细叙述了威克姆为了金钱而放弃圣职的事情。她虽然没挑明是听谁说的，但却强调这故事很可能是真实可靠的。

加德纳太太听罢，感到惊奇，却又被深深吸引住了。只是他们一行这时已来到了曾经给过她许多欢乐的地方，于是她把千头万绪都抛置脑后，完全沉醉在美好的回忆之中。她把周围的名胜古迹一一指给丈夫看，忙得她没有空暇去思考别的事情。走了一上午的路，她早已疲惫不堪。可是一吃过饭，她又跑去探访旧友，跟阔别多年的老熟人谈天说地，度过了一个别具情趣的傍晚。

白天发生的事情都与伊丽莎白利益相关，所以她晚上无心思去结交新朋友。她的大脑一直在想个不停，想到了达西待他们是多么彬彬有礼，最让她感到纳闷的是，他居然希望能把妹妹介绍给她。





第四十四章


根据伊丽莎白的判断，达西将要待妹妹回到彭伯里后，第二天带妹妹来拜访她。因此，她决定那天上午不出远门，在旅店恭候客人。然而，她的判断失灵了。她和舅父舅妈来到兰顿的第二天早晨，客人们便大驾光临了。当时，她与舅父舅妈随几位新朋友在附近溜达了一圈，刚刚回到旅店，准备换件衣服就到朋友家吃饭。忽然外边传来了隆隆的车马声，把他们吸引到了窗旁，但见一男一女乘坐一辆双轮马车沿着大街奔驰而来。伊丽莎白立即认出了车夫的号衣，猜着了是怎么回事，于是把这出人意料的消息告诉了舅父舅妈，声称马上有贵宾光临。

舅父舅妈感到十分惊奇。他们见她说话时神情窘迫，再把此事与昨天的种种情形联系起来一分析，心中不由豁然开朗。他们以前不摸底细，而现在觉得达西既然对他们的外甥女这般殷勤，除了是倾心于她外，再没有别的解释。他们脑子里不断转着这些新念头，岂不知伊丽莎白在一旁却越加心慌意乱。她简直不明白自己为什么如此沉不住气。她左思右想，唯恐达西会因为爱她的缘故，在妹妹面前把她捧得过高。她非常想给客人留下好印象，只是怀疑自己不具备取悦于人的天赋。

她怕让来人瞧见，于是离开了窗口。她在屋里来回踱起了步，千方百计想稳定情绪，不料看到了舅父舅妈那询问的目光和诧异的神情，于是越加慌乱起来。

达西兄妹双双走了进来，紧接着就是一番气氛严肃的介绍。伊丽莎白发现她的新朋友也和她一样局促不安，不禁感到意外。自从来到兰顿之后，总听人说达西小姐傲气十足。但是仅仅观察了几分钟的时间，她就断定达西小姐并非傲慢，而是过于腼腆。达西小姐只是简单应答几声，除此之外很难再从她口中掏出一句话来。

她身材较高，比伊丽莎白大一个型号。虽然年仅十六岁，但她的体态已发育成型，一举一动端庄典雅，活似一个小大人。她不及哥哥那般漂亮，但脸蛋却也聪颖风趣，待人接物谦恭温和。伊丽莎白本以为她会出言尖酸刻薄、不留情面，现在见她与自己的想象截然相反，便不由产生了轻松感。

大家相见不久，达西就告诉她，宾利也要来探望她。她刚想说声不胜荣幸，准备迎接宾利的到来，就听见楼梯上传来了急促的脚步声。转眼间，宾利走了进来。伊丽莎白对他的怨艾早已冰消雪融。再说，即便她余怒未消，只要瞧瞧他与她重逢时的那种情恳意切的态度，也是恨不起他来。他一见面就问她的家里人安好，虽然问得非常笼统，但却亲切友善，神情谈吐与从前一样愉悦从容。

加德纳夫妇和她有同感，也觉得宾利是个十分风趣的人。他们早就盼望着和他认识。眼前的这些人引起了他们浓厚的兴趣。他们适才怀疑到达西和他们的外甥女关系不一般，这时便禁不住偷眼仔细观察双方的一言一行，并很快得出了结论：这两人中有一个至少已尝到了恋爱的滋味；女方的感情尚有些难以捉摸，但男方却含情脉脉，爱恋之心叫人一目了然。

伊丽莎白这边忙得不可开交，既要弄清每一位客人的心思，还要稳定自己的情绪，和颜悦色地与他们亲热。她最担心的是不能博得客人们的好感，不想偏偏在这方面她取得了极佳的效果，因为她急于取悦的这些人，早就对她有好感。宾利愿意和她交好，乔治亚娜渴望和她交好，而达西非得和她交好不成。

见到宾利，她自然而然就想到了自己的姐姐。她多么想知道宾利是不是也在思念同一个人呵！有时，她觉得他似乎不像从前那样健谈了。有一两次宾利盯着她瞧时，她甚至还以为他企图在她身上寻找她与姐姐的相像之处。这些也许只是她自己的凭空瞎想，不过她有一点却看得十分真切：他对达西小姐其实并没有深情厚意。都说达西小姐是简的情敌，但现在看来她和宾利之间不存在特殊的关系。这一切迹象都与宾利小姐的愿望背道而驰。没过多久，伊丽莎白的这种看法便得到了证实。客人们临别之前，又出现了两三个小小的插曲，由于伊丽莎白爱姐心切，她便觉得这些插曲足见宾利对简旧情难忘，倘若胆子再大一点，他真想顺着朝下讲，往简的身上扯。一次，他趁着其他人在一起交谈的当儿，以一种十分遗憾的口吻对伊丽莎白说：“很长时间没见到你了。”她还没来得及回话，他又说道，“八个多月的时间恍如隔世。记得咱们最后一次见面是在十一月二十六日，当时大家都在尼瑟费德跳舞。”

伊丽莎白见他对往事记得这么清楚，心中不由暗喜。后来，他又趁着其他人不留意的时候，问她的姐姐和妹妹是否全在浪搏恩家中。按说这个问题并无深意，就连他刚才的话也只是一般性的交谈，但他的表情神态却耐人寻味。

伊丽莎白极少能够把目光集中在达西身上，但无论她什么时候瞥他一眼，总会看到他脸上挂着和蔼的表情。她听见他的谈吐中既没有丝毫的高傲气息，也没有半点对她亲戚的轻蔑。这使她不由想到，昨天她亲眼目睹他的态度大有转变，即便那只是暂时的现象，但起码也持续到了今天。她发现，几个月前他还认为不屑于和这些人打交道，而今却主动和他们套近乎，并且企图博得他们的好感。她还发现，他不仅对她彬彬有礼，待她的亲戚也客客气气，而正是这些亲戚曾经遭受过他的公开鄙视。上次他在亨斯福德向她求婚的那一幕，还历历如在眼前，现在对比起来，前后真是判若两人。这种种情况令她感触颇深，使她简直掩饰不住内心的惊异。她从未见过他如此屈尊俯就地讨好别人。无论是在尼瑟费德和亲朋好友朝夕相处时，或是在罗辛斯庄园同高贵的亲戚住在一起时，都不曾见他像现在这般平易近人和谦恭祥和。岂不知，他向她的亲戚大献殷勤以及与他们结交往来。到头来只会惹得尼瑟费德和罗辛斯的太太小姐们笑话，成为她们抨击的对象。

客人们闲坐了半个多小时。当他们起身告辞时，达西拉妹妹和他一道向加德纳夫妇及贝内特小姐发出邀请，希望他们能在离开此地之前到彭伯里庄园吃顿饭。达西小姐虽然生性羞怯，不善于说这些应酬的话，但还是欣然服从了哥哥的意志。加德纳太太拿眼睛瞅了瞅外甥女。想看看她的意思如何，因为达西兄妹主要邀请的是她。不料伊丽莎白却把头转向了一旁。加德纳太太见她有意回避，以为她是一时羞怯，而非不愿意接受邀请，又见平时一向热衷于交际的丈夫显露出十分情愿的神色，于是便大着胆子应承了下来。当下，大家把赴宴的日期定在了后天。

宾利显得大喜过望，因为他又可以见到伊丽莎白了。他还有许多话要对她讲，指望着详细向她打听一下哈福德郡那些朋友的情况。伊丽莎白认为他只是想听她谈淡姐姐的近境，因而心里很高兴。客人走后，她细想起了这半个小时里所谈到的种种事情，虽然觉得自己并未获得丁点的乐趣，却滋生了一些得意的感觉。她特别想一个人待着，害怕舅父舅妈追三问四或者说些寓意深长的话，于是稍微听他们夸奖了几句宾利，便急忙溜走换衣服去了。

其实，她用不着害怕加德纳夫妇盘根问底，因为他们并不想强迫她讲心里话。显然，她和达西的交情之深厚，远远超出了他们以前的想象；显然，达西已经深深地爱上了她。舅父和舅妈看到了不少发人深省的现象，只是不便启齿问她。

他们一心只想着达西的好处，自和他认识截至现在还找不出他的什么缺点。他对他们那样客气，使得他们不得不感动。如果仅凭自己的感觉以及女管家的赞扬去判断他的人品，而不参考其他人的看法，他们要是说出去，哈福德郡那些认识达西的人就会分辨不出他们讲的是达西其人。他们夫妇俩分析了一下实际情况，现在都觉得女管家的话真实可信了。女管家在达西四岁时就来到了府上，深知他的为人，再说她自己的言谈举止也是那般体面，所以对她的观点千万不可置若罔闻。就连兰顿的朋友所提供的情况实际上也无损于他的形象，因为他们除了说他傲慢以外，再也寻不出别的罪名。说他傲慢，也许倒是真的；即便他并不傲慢，小集镇上的居民就根据他们家的人从不涉足小镇这一条，也会那么议论他。不过，大家都承认他乐善好施，为穷苦人做了不少好事。

至于那位威克姆，加德纳夫妇很快就发现当地人对他的评价并不高。人们虽然不大了解他与他恩公的儿子之间有什么纠葛，但人人都知道他离开德比郡的时候，已经是债台高筑，全是达西先生为他还钱。

话说伊丽莎白，今天晚上并不比昨天晚上轻松，脑子里想的全是彭伯里庄园的事情。这个夜晚显得是那么漫长，但她又嫌时间不够用。她心里思绪万千，掂量着自己对那位住在深宅大院里的人到底怀着什么样的感情。她躺在床上，足足有两个小时难以入眠，决心理出个头绪来。仇恨当然是谈不上，因为她对他的怨艾早已经烟消云散。如果她从前对他的感情可以称作厌恶的话，那么，她老早就开始为自己的草率感到惭愧了。他的高贵品质令她肃然起敬，尽管她当初不愿承认这个事实，但心里却因此不再讨厌他了。人们众口一词，都高度地评价他，昨天她又亲眼目睹了那一幕幕友善的情景，看出他原是个性格温柔的人，于是，尊敬之外又增添了几分亲切的感情。其实，现在的问题已不在于她是如何敬重他了，而在于她的心里萌发了渴望友谊的动机，这才是不容忽视的。她对他怀着感激之情，这不仅仅因为他曾经爱过她、也因为他现在迷恋着她。当初她那么怒气冲冲、恶言恶语地拒绝了他，还无端地指责他，可是他对这一切都既往不咎。她原以为他对她恨之入骨，唯恐躲避不及，谁想这次邂逅，他却急巴巴地想同她建立情意。他没说一句令人扫兴的话，没做出一点离谱的举动，竭力想博得她亲戚的好感，并一心一意要她和他的妹妹做朋友，全都是为了这个目的。那么一个傲慢的人竟会发生如此巨大的变化，不仅令她觉得惊讶，也使她万分感激。这种变化应该归根于一片爱心，归根于他对她的痴情。她虽然无法精确地解释他的爱恋之心，但觉得那是一种温馨的情意，值得促其发展。出于尊敬和感激，她衷心希望他得到幸福。不过，她很想知道，自己到底愿对这种幸福作出多大的贡献。她深信自己仍有能力让他再次求婚，但不知应该把能力发挥到何种程度才有利于他们双方都获得幸福。

傍晚时分，她曾和舅妈作过一番交谈，认为达西小姐太懂礼貌了，回到彭伯里已经过了吃早饭的时候，却顾不得旅途的劳顿，于当天就赶来看望她们。她们即使比不上达西小姐那般礼貌周全，却也应该礼尚往来，做做友好的表示。最后她们认为，最好第二天早晨到彭伯里庄园回拜她。此事就这么敲定了。伊丽莎白满心欢喜，不过当她问自己为什么如此激动时，她就无言可答了。

次日吃过早饭后，加德纳先生便出了门。因为他们昨天在一起又讨论了钓鱼的事情，约好由他于中午时分赶到彭伯里庄园与那几位先生会合，一道去垂钓。





第四十五章


伊丽莎白现在深信不疑，宾利小姐之所以讨厌她，无非是忌妒心在作祟。于是，她不由想到，这次造访彭伯里庄园，一定会受到宾利小姐的冷眼相待。不过，她倒很想看看，这次故人重逢，那位小姐将会有一番什么样的表演。

到了彭伯里府邸，她们由人引着走过厅堂，来到了客厅里。这儿坐南朝北，夏日里清爽宜人。窗户外边是一片空地，但见屋后层峦叠嶂，树高林密，居间的草地上星星点点散布着美丽的橡树和西班牙栗树，好一派赏心悦目的庄园风光。

在这间厅堂里，她们受到了达西小姐的接待。同达西小姐坐在一起的还有赫斯特太太、宾利小姐，以及那位陪她住在伦敦的女士。乔治亚娜待客人十分礼貌，但却由于羞怯和害怕失礼，一举一动都显得局促不安。要是让那些自以为地位比她低贱的人看来，八成会觉得她傲慢冷漠。不过，加德纳太太及其外甥女却非常体谅和同情她。

赫斯特太太和宾利小姐只是向客人们行了个屈膝礼。大家落座之后，紧接着就是一阵沉默，一阵令人尴尬的沉默。后来，还是安妮斯利太太率先打破了僵局。她是个文文静静、满脸和气的女人。她竭力想找出些话来，这样就显得比另外的两个女人有教养些。谈话是在她和加德纳太太之间进行的，伊丽莎白只是偶尔插上两句，而达西小姐也想凑凑兴，但又缺乏说话的勇气。有时达西小姐要胆大支吾两声，也是在确保无人听得见的情况下。

伊丽莎白不多久便发现，宾利小姐在密切监视着她。她说的每一句话，特别是她讲给达西小姐的话，全都逃不过对方的耳朵。其实，她和达西小姐离得较远，谈起话来不太方便。要不然，她才不管宾利小姐的监视，那么少言寡语呢。不过，她并没有感到遗憾，因为她此时的心思较重，光想着那几位男人会随时走进来。她既希望又害怕彭府的主人也跟着一道进来，但究竟是希望得迫切还是害怕得厉害，连她自己也搞不清。她们这样呆坐了一刻钟，没听到宾利小姐发表一言半语。后来，宾利小姐总算启开了金口，冷冰冰地问候伊丽莎白的家里人安好。伊丽莎白先是一愣，继而也同样冷冷淡淡、简简单单地敷衍了几句。对方听了，也就不再说什么了。

接着，用人们送来了冷肉、点心以及各种优质时鲜水果，这才算活跃了一点气氛。本来，达西小姐并没有叫人送这些吃的东西，多亏安妮斯利太太不断地递眼色和送微笑提醒她，她这才想起了应尽尽地主之谊。这一来，大家就都有事情做了——虽然不是人人健谈，但是个个都会吃。她们见到大堆鲜美的葡萄、油桃和桃子，一下子聚拢来围着桌子坐下。

大家品尝水果之际，达西走了进来。这就给伊丽莎白提供了一个绝妙的机会，使她能够根据此刻的心情判断她究竟是害怕他在场，还是希望他在场。刚才她满以为自己在期盼他尽快出现，可现在却觉得他还是不来为好。

达西带着两三个人从府里赶到河边，与加德纳先生一道钓了一会儿鱼。后来他听加德纳先生说他的妻子及伊丽莎白上午到了彭府拜访乔治亚娜，便匆忙回到家中。伊丽莎白一见他走进屋，便理智地决定，一定要做到从容不迫、落落大方。这样的决定倒是很有必要，只不过落实到行动上就不那么轻松容易了。她发现全屋的人都在以怀疑的目光打量她和达西。达西自从一进来，几乎每双眼睛都在观察着他的一举一动。宾利小姐比任何人都表现得露骨，一副好奇心十足的样子。不过，她在和达西或伊丽莎白说话时，却满脸堆笑。这说明妒忌心并没有使她不择手段，也说明她压根就没放弃对达西的追求。达西小姐见哥哥进了屋，便尽量多说话。伊丽莎白看得出来，达西一心想让妹妹同她接近，并且竭力寻找话头让她们多多交谈。宾利小姐瞧在眼里，怒在心头，后来就顾不得礼貌了，寻了个机会冷言冷语地说道：

“请问，伊丽莎白小姐，民兵团是不是从麦里屯撤走啦？这对你们家可是个巨大的损失啊。”

由于达西在跟前，她没敢明着提威克姆的名字。不过伊丽莎白一听就清楚，她指的就是那个人，因此不禁想起过去跟他的一些来往，情绪一时低落了下来。但为了还击这恶毒的攻击，她又立即振作起来，用一种满不在乎的语调回了宾利小姐的话。说话间，她不由自主地往旁边扫了一眼，只见达西面红耳赤，恳切地望着她，而他的妹妹则心乱神迷，低头无语。宾利小姐要是早知道她那含沙射影的话会刺痛自己意中人的心，她自然是不会说出口的。她认为伊丽莎白倾心于威克姆，这才影射了一通，其目的只是为了扰乱伊丽莎白的方寸，迫使她流露出些许凄哀之情，好让达西瞧不起她，甚至还可以让达西想起她的几个妹妹跟民兵团的军官厮混过，干出了一些荒唐的事。关于达西小姐企图私奔一事，她没有听到过半点风声。达西守口如瓶，除了对伊丽莎白，没有向任何人透露过这个秘密。特别是对宾利家的人，他更是只字不提，因为他希望妹妹能和宾利攀亲结缘，这一点伊丽莎白早就看了出来。虽说他的确有此打算，但这并不意味着他是为了这个原因才千方百计地试图拆散宾利和简。也许，他这样做只是出于对他朋友幸福的关心。

他见伊丽莎白泰然自若、声色不动，也就马上安下了心来。宾利小姐虽然十分苦恼失望，却不敢再影射威克姆了。乔治亚娜也随即恢复了常态，只是一时间还说不出话来。宾利小姐害怕去迎达西的目光，因为她觉得达西并没有买她的账。她原以为凭着自己的神机妙算，可以让达西回心转意，不再眷恋伊丽莎白，结果反而使他对伊丽莎白更加柔情缱绻。

经过上述的一问一答之后，客人们没隔多久便起身告辞了。达西送她们上马车的时候，宾利小姐发泄起了胸中的怨恨，把伊丽莎白的人品、举止和衣着说得一无是处。不过，达西小姐没有搭她的腔。既然哥哥那么推崇伊丽莎白，她当然也应该喜欢她，因为哥哥不可能把人看错。他曾经高度评价过伊丽莎白，这就使乔治亚娜觉得，伊丽莎白只能是一位可亲可爱的女子。待达西回到客厅时，宾利小姐禁不住把刚才跟他妹妹说的话，拉出一段来又重复了一遍。

“达西先生，伊丽莎白·贝内特今天上午的气色看上去真吓人，”她高声嚷嚷道，“跟去年冬天相比，她像是又变了一个人，那皮肤又黑又粗！我生平还从没见过有哪个人变化这么大。我和路易莎都觉得，简直认不出她来啦。”

达西尽管不愿听这种话，但还是冰冷冷地支吾了几句，说他看不出伊丽莎白有什么变化，只不过皮肤晒黑了些而已，这是夏天旅行的结果，不足为奇。

“要让我看，”宾利小姐接着说道，“我觉得她一点也不美。她的脸蛋太瘦长，皮肤缺乏光泽，眉目也不清秀。她的鼻子没有一点特性，线条不清晰。她的牙齿还看得过去，可也只不过是平平常常。有些人夸她的眼睛长得美，我却觉得没有什么了不起的。那双眼睛又尖刻又蛮横，让人喜欢不起来。她的整个气度过于目空一切，十分不成体统，叫人无法忍受。”

宾利小姐既然已经瞧出达西看上了伊丽莎白，却用这种方式争风吃醋，实在不高明。可人到了气头上，难免会丧失理智。她见达西后来露出了恼怒之色，自以为大功已经告成。不过，达西始终一声不响。为了引他开口，她又继续说道：

“记得咱们在哈福德郡初次见到她的时候，听说她是个有名的美人，都觉得十分奇怪。尤其令我难忘的是，有一天晚上，她们在尼瑟费德吃完宴席离开后，你这样说道：‘她要是称得上美人，那我就应该把她的母亲叫做才女！’不过，后来你对她的印象就好了起来。想必你曾经有段时间还把她视为漂亮人呢。”

“不错，”达西忍无可忍，终于说了话，“刚认识她的时候，我是说过她。可最近好几个月来，我已经把她看做我所认识的绝色女子当中的一个了。”

他说完掉头走开了。宾利小姐讨了个没趣。她原想逗引他说几句瞧不起伊丽莎白的话，可是却落了个搬起石头砸自己脚的可悲下场。

话说加德纳太太和伊丽莎白回到旅店里，把这次做客中遇到的情况统统议论了一番，唯独没有谈到双方都特别感兴趣的那件事。她们议论了所见到的每个人的神情举止，唯独没有提她们最为关注的那个人。她们谈到了他的妹妹、他的朋友、他的房舍以及水果——样样都涉及了，唯独没有谈到他本人。其实，伊丽莎白十分想知道加德纳太太对他看法如何，而加德纳太太却期待着外甥女先扯起这个话题。





第四十六章


伊丽莎白抵达兰顿的头一天，因为没见到简的来信，心里感到十分失望。第二天上午仍不见简的信来，于是失望感又一次左右了她。可是到了第三天早晨，她的烦闷顿时消失，再也不抱怨姐姐了，因为她一下子收到了姐姐的两封信，其中一封注明曾经误投过地方。她看后并不觉得奇怪，因为简把地址写得非常潦草。

信送来的时候，他们三人正准备出去溜达。舅父舅妈只好自己走了，让她一个人安安静静地读信。那封误投过的信写于五天之前，应该先读读。信首介绍的是一些小型舞会和宴会的情况，以及一些乡村小道消息。这封信的后半截写于第二天，笔调显得非常浮躁，但内容却比较重要。其文如下：


亲爱的丽茨，这封信只写了一半，就发生了一件极其出人意料、极其严重的事件。说出来，真害怕吓坏了你。请你放心，家里的人都平安无事。我要讲的事与可怜的莉迪亚有关。昨天夜里十二点钟，我们刚上床睡觉，突然接到了福斯特上校派人送来的一封急信。信里告诉我们，莉迪亚跟他手下的一名军官跑到苏格兰去了。实说吧，就是跟威克姆私奔啦！我们当时的吃惊心情你是可以想象的。不过，吉蒂好像对此事并不觉得多么意外。我感到非常非常难过，想不到他们就这么冒冒失失配成了一对！不过，我还是愿意把他们往好处想，希望是人们误解了威克姆的人品。说他轻率鲁莽，这倒是叫人不难相信，可是在这次的事情上，看不出他有任何存心不良的地方（让我们为此而庆幸吧）。他看中莉迪亚至少不是为了钱财，因为他一定知道，莉迪亚从父亲的手中什么也得不到。咱们的母亲真是可怜，简直伤透了心。父亲还比较沉得住气。谢天谢地，幸亏咱们没告诉他那些有关威克姆的传闻。咱们自己，也不该把那些传闻记挂在心上。据大家猜想，莉迪亚和威克姆是在星期天夜间十二点左右跑掉的，可是直到昨天早晨八点钟，人们才发现他们不见了。于是，福斯特上校马上送来了急信。亲爱的丽茨，他们一定是从距我们不足十英里的地方经过的。福斯特上校在信中说，他很快就会赶到这里。莉迪亚给福斯特太太留下一封短简，把他们俩的打算告诉了她。我不得不就此搁笔了，因为我不能离开可怜的母亲太久。恐怕你一定会感到莫名其妙吧，其实就连我自己也弄不清自己都写了些什么。



伊丽莎白看完这封信后，没有顾得上细想，也没有理会心里到底是什么滋味，便连忙拿起了另一封信，急不可耐地把信拆开就看。这封信比第一封信的后半部分晚写了一天。


亲爱的妹妹，谅你现在已收到了我那封匆匆草就的信。但愿这封信能把问题解释得透彻些。不过，时间虽然并不紧迫，我的头脑却糊里糊涂，所以便难以保证能把信写得条理清晰。亲爱的丽茨，我提起笔来，却不知写什么好。可是我总得把坏消息告诉你呀，因为这种事耽搁不得。威克姆和可怜的莉迪亚办事尽管过于轻率，但我们还是希望他们能够结婚。我们现在十分担心，害怕他们并没有到苏格兰去。福斯特上校前天发出那封急信后，没过几个小时便离开了布赖顿，已于昨日赶到了这儿。虽然莉迪亚在留给福斯特太大的短简中说，他们要到格雷特纳格林[1]去，但是丹尼却露出口风，说威克姆从没有过到那儿去的打算，也压根没想娶莉迪亚为妻。福斯特上校听到这话，顿时慌了手脚，连忙从布赖顿出发，希望能把他们追回来。一路上，他不费吹灰之力就寻到了克拉帕姆，可是再往前追就困难了，因为那两个到了克拉帕姆便换乘了出租马车，把他们从埃普瑟姆雇来的马车打发掉了。以后的情况就不得而知了，只听人说他们上了到伦敦去的路。福斯特上校顺着伦敦的方向四处打听，进入哈福德郡之后，又在各路口逢人便问，并查询了巴内特以及哈特菲尔德两地所有的旅店，结果一无所获。人们都说没见这样的两个人走过。无奈，福斯特上校只好带着一颗极为关切的心来到了浪搏恩，十分诚恳地向我们倾吐了他的满腹忧虑。我真为他们夫妻俩感到难过。这件事怎么说也不能怪他们。亲爱的丽茨，我们简直痛苦到了极点。父母亲都把事情想得一团糟，但我却不能把他看得那么坏。也许是由于环境所迫，那两人更改了原来的计划，觉得到城里去悄悄地结婚较为合适。纵使他欺侮莉迪亚年幼无知，没有显贵亲戚，因而对她存心不良（这是不可能的），难道莉迪亚自己也会不顾一切吗？这样的事绝不会发生！不过，福斯特上校说他不相信他们会结婚，这话叫我听了十分伤感。当我把自己乐观的看法讲给他听时，他连连摇头，说威克姆恐怕靠不住。可怜的母亲真是病倒了，从早到晚闭门不出。她要是能想开些，身体就会好起来，可惜这一点她无法做到。父亲的情形也很惨，以前从没见他这么忧伤过。可怜的吉蒂在生自己的气，责怪自己不该隐瞒他们的恋情。不过这是应该保密的私房话，也难怪她没讲出来。亲爱的丽茨，我真为你感到高兴，因为你没有看到这些令人心碎的场面。现在，第一阵惊骇已经过去了，希望你能回到家中。不过，要是不方便的话，我绝不会只顾自己的情绪，硬逼你返家。再见吧！瞧我刚刚说不逼你回来，可这一拿起笔，又要违背自己的许诺了。因为照目前的情况看来，我不得不恳求你们尽快回来。我深深了解舅父舅妈的为人，所以才敢这般无所顾忌地请求他们。另外，我还有别的事情想请舅父帮忙。父亲马上要和福斯特上校一道去伦敦寻找莉迪亚。他的心里有什么打算，我是不得而知。可是见他这般痛苦万状，我就觉得他可能会干出缺乏理智的莽撞事。而福斯特上校明天晚上还得赶回布赖顿去。在这紧急关头，非得请舅父前来指点和协助不行。他一定会体谅我的心情，帮我们渡过难关。



“天哪，舅舅呢？舅舅哪里去啦？”伊丽莎白看完信，霍地从座位上一跃而起，大声喊叫着，急匆匆去寻找舅父，连一分钟的时间都不愿浪费。不料她刚走到门口，就见一位用人把门推开了，紧接着达西走了进来。达西瞧她脸色苍白，一副慌张样子，不由吃了一惊。还未等他定下神来说句话，就听到一心只挂念着莉迪亚的伊丽莎白急火火地喊叫道：“请原谅，恕我不能奉陪。我现在必须去找加德纳先生，有件事情耽搁不得，片刻也不便拖延。”

“天哪！出什么事啦？”达西一时感情冲动，也就顾不得礼貌，脱口喊道。但随即他又恢复了平静，对伊丽莎白说：“我一分钟也不愿耽搁你，不过还是让我或者用人，去寻找加德纳夫妇吧。你身体欠佳，不能亲自去。”

伊丽莎白犹豫不决，但这时她的双膝瑟瑟发抖，自己觉得这副样子无法去找人。于是，她唤回了用人，吩咐他去把加德纳夫妇立即找回来。说话时，她上气不接下气，几乎让人听不清楚。

用人走后，她实在支撑不住，便坐了下来。达西见她脸色非常难看，不放心丢下她自己走开，于是用一种温柔体贴的声音对她说：“让我把女用人唤来。是不是喝点什么缓和一下情绪？我给你端杯酒来，好吗？你像是病得不轻。”

“不用啦，谢谢你。”她说着，竭力想恢复平静，“其实，我身体很好，一点事都没有。只是接到了浪搏恩传来的一个不幸的消息，心里感到难过。”

说到这里，她泪流满面，半天都讲不出一句话来。达西见状不由心如刀绞，只能语句不清地说了些关切的话宽慰她，然后便不胜同情地默默望着她。后来，伊丽莎白又说道：“我刚刚接到简的一封信，知道了一个极为可怕的消息。这件事是包不住的，谁都瞒不了。我那最小的妹妹丢下了所有的亲友……私奔了。她是让……让威克姆先生拐跑的。他们俩是从布赖顿走掉的，你了解威克姆，知道他会干出什么事来。我妹妹既没钱又没地位，没有什么可以吸引他……莉迪亚的这辈子算给毁啦。”

达西给惊呆了。“现在想起来，”伊丽莎白以一种更为焦虑的声音说，“我本来是可以阻止这件事的！我了解他是什么货色，只要把其中的一部分真相——一部分我所知道的真相告诉给家里人，那就好啦！莉迪亚要是了解了他的人品，就不会出这种事。可现在全完啦，说什么也都太迟了。”

达西高声说道：“我感到十分痛心，既痛心又震惊。不过，这消息靠得住吗，我是说完全靠得住吗？”

“千真万确！他们是在星期天的夜间私奔的。有人跟着他们的踪迹一直追到伦敦，以后他们就销声匿迹了。有一点是肯定的——他们没去苏格兰。”

“有没有想什么办法去寻找她？”

“家父已经到了伦敦。简写信来，就是请舅舅赶快回去想办法。但愿我们半个小时后就能动身上路。不过事情已经没有指望了，我深知连一点指望都没有啦。怎么能斗得过他这样一个人呢？就连找到他们也是不可能的。对此我不抱任何希望。唉，真是太可怕啦！”

达西摇了摇头，默默地同意了她的话。

“我可是早就了解了他的真面目呀……唉，都怪我当时不清楚自己应该干些什么，怪我怕这怕那！可是我那时不知道……我是害怕把事情做过了火。真是一个让人痛心的错误！”

达西没有吱声。他仿佛没有听见她的话，只见他眉头紧锁、神情忧郁，一边在屋里来回踱步，一边苦思冥想。伊丽莎白见此情景，立即明白了他的心思。她觉得她对他的魅力在一点点消失。都怪家里人不争气，做出这种丑事，难怪让人家瞧不起。她对此并不感到诧异，也没有任何怨言。她相信他能够克制住自己，但这不能给她带来安慰，也无法减轻她的痛苦。事情恰恰相反，她由此而澄清了自己的心愿。她第一次真正地感受到，她完全可以爱上他。只可惜她现在即便有千情万爱，也是枉然。

她虽然产生了些私心杂念，但却没有沉湎于儿女情长的遐想之中。莉迪亚的私奔以及她给大家带来的耻辱和痛苦，立刻使伊丽莎白忘掉了自己的私情。她用手帕蒙住面孔，顿时把周围的一切都抛在了脑后。过了一会儿，同伴的声音把她唤回到了现实之中。只听达西饱含着同情，又带着几分拘谨说道：“恐怕你早就希望我走开了。我除了能表达一下真诚的但又无用的关心以外，再也帮不上别的忙。所以我没理由恳请留下。我只希望能尽自己的菲薄之力，说上几句安慰话或者干点实事，以减轻你的痛苦！但空口说白话只会让你觉得我是在有意识讨好你，故而我就不再多言了。出了这种不幸的事，你们恐怕今天不能到彭伯里与舍妹叙谈了。”

“哦，是的。务请你向达西小姐转达我们的歉意，就说我们有急事必须立刻回家去。至于那些叫人不愉快的真相，能不说就不说……我知道此事隐瞒不了多久。”

达西满口答应为她保密，并再次表示自己十分同情她的痛苦。他希望事情将会有一个圆满的结局，而不至于像现在想象的这么糟。接着，他请她代为问候她的亲友，最后又关心地望了她一眼，便告辞了。

他一走出房间，伊丽莎白就想到：这次在德比郡和他重逢，几次见面都是在坦诚的气氛中进行的，而这样的情况以后恐怕不会再出现了。回首往事，自从他们认识以来，两人之间风波叠起，关系千变万化。她以前巴不得中止他们的交情，而今又热切希望继续保持这种交往。

如果说感激和敬重是爱情的良好基础，那么，伊丽莎白在感情上的变化就不足为奇了，也无可非议。世界上还有一种爱情，即所谓的一见钟情，有的甚至还没有说上两句话便倾心于对方。如果把这两种爱情的方式作一比较，一见钟情显得更合乎情理、更自然的话，我们就不好颂扬伊丽莎白的爱情了。不过还应该指出一点：当初她对威克姆倒有一些一见钟情的味道，后来的结果不尽如人意，她这才选择了一种趣味性不太大的寄寓感情的方式。情况虽然如此，但她眼看着达西离去后，心里还是感到十分懊丧。莉迪亚的丑事一开头就弄得他们俩不欢而散，再想想那件倒霉的事件本身，她越加觉得痛苦。自打看过了简的第二封信那时起，她从来就没指望过威克姆会存心娶莉迪亚。她觉得除了简之外，没有第二个人会抱有这种指望。事态的这种发展趋势，一点儿也不让她感到奇怪。读到第一封信的时候，她倒是感到十分意外，也觉得非常惊奇。她搞不懂威克姆怎么要娶一个无利可图的姑娘。莉迪亚怎么会让他着迷，似乎也让人不可理解。但是现在看来，这一切都再自然不过了。像这样轻浪的情爱，莉迪亚有那点妖劲儿也就足够了。伊丽莎白虽然并不觉得她在跟人家私奔时没有做过结婚的打算，但却觉得她性格轻浮、鼠目寸光，很容易被人家勾引走。

民兵团驻扎在哈福德郡的时候，她看不出莉迪亚对威克姆有什么倾心之处。不过她相信，凭莉迪亚那个样子，只要谁一勾引她准会上钩。有时候，某个军官向她献献殷勤，就会叫她春心荡漾，而有时她则会迷上另一名军官。她的感情变化莫测，但从未缺少过谈情说爱的对象。都怪家里对她管教不严和一味地纵容，才使她堕落到了今天这种田地。天哪！伊丽莎白现在真是感触太深啦！

她恨不得插翅飞回家中，亲耳听听和亲眼看看那儿的情况，为简分担一份忧愁。家里乱成了一锅粥，父亲出门在外，而母亲撑不起身子，随时需要人侍候，千斤重担全压在了简一人身上。简也可能已经意识到莉迪亚的事情已糟到了不可收拾的地步，但如果有舅舅指点迷津，似乎可以起到至关紧要的作用。只有舅舅到了家中，方可减轻她心中的痛苦。且说加德纳夫妇听到用人的话，还以为外甥女突然患了急病呢，于是急急火火地赶回了旅店。伊丽莎白见到他们后，急忙解释了唤他们回来的原因，打消了他们这方面的顾虑。接着，她给他们读了简的两封信，并着重强调了一下第二封信后边的附言，急得声音都颤抖了起来。舅父舅妈平常并不太喜欢莉迪亚，但这时也由不得为她忧虑重重，因为此事不仅涉及莉迪亚，而且与所有的人都息息相关。加德纳先生一开始就惊得长吁短叹，继而立即答应将尽一切力量提供帮助。伊丽莎白早就料到他会慷慨相助，但听了后还是感激得流出了眼泪。他们三人心往一处想，劲朝一处使，很快便打点行装，做好了上路的准备。他们认为出发得越早越好。“咱们这一走，彭伯里那边怎么交代呢？”加德纳太太嚷嚷道，“约翰对我们说，你派他去找我们的时候，达西先生就在这里，此话当真？”

“是的。我告诉他说，咱们不能赴约去啦。这件事就这么谈妥了。”

舅妈跑回自己的房间做准备时，嘴里念叨着：“他们是怎么谈妥的呢？难道他们真的相好到这种地步，她都可以把底细全部交代给他？唉，我多么想知道这到底是怎么回事！”

可惜她的愿望落了个空，充其量也只不过是在这忙乱的一个小时里使她得到了一点乐趣。纵使伊丽莎白偷空能和她谈谈，也会觉得在眼下这种狼狈不堪的情况下，哪会有心思扯这种事。更何况她和舅妈一样，有许多事情需要料理。别的且不说，她得给兰顿的朋友们写些留言，为他们的突然离开编造借口。好在一小时之内，所有的事情都处理得停停当当。与此同时，加德纳先生也跟旅店里结了账，光等着动身了。伊丽莎白虽说苦恼了整整一个上午，但没想到只用了这么短的时间就坐上马车，踏上了归家的旅途。

[1]格雷特纳格林：系苏格兰南部与英格兰接壤处的一个村庄。当时，许多英格兰恋人都私奔到那里举行婚礼。





第四十七章


乘车走出小镇的时候，舅父对伊丽莎白说：“我把这事又仔细考虑了一下，想来想去，还是觉得你姐姐的看法是对的。我认为，任哪一个年轻小伙子都不会对莉迪亚这样的姑娘动坏念头，因为她又不是无亲无靠，更何况她就住在他自己的长官家中。所以，我对事情的结局抱着乐观的态度。他难道没想到，姑娘的亲友会挺身而出吗？难道在冒犯了福斯特上校之后，他还敢回到民兵团吗？我看他绝不会头脑发热、铤而走险了！”

“您真的这么想吗？”伊丽莎白顿时面露喜色，叫出了声来。

“说句老实话，”加德纳太太说，“我赞成你舅舅的观点。像这种丧尽天良、败坏名声，于自己没有半点好处的事情，让他干他也不会去干。所以，我觉得不能把威克姆想得太坏。丽茨，作为你自己，难道对他一点也不相信，认为他会干出那种事来？”

“他即便不考虑别人的利益，也会掂量一下此事将给自己带来什么样的后果。假如情况真的是这样，他就不敢铤而走险！不过，我对这一点可不抱任何指望。如果真的像你们所说的那样，他们为什么不到苏格兰去呢？”

“至于他们去没有去苏格兰，现在还很难说，因为咱们没有掌握确切的证据。”加德纳先生说。

“有证据！他们打发掉原来的马车，换上了出租马车，光凭这一点就很能说明问题啦！此外，到巴内特去的路上，没有发现他们的任何踪迹。”

“那么就假设他们到了伦敦吧。他们到那儿去也只是为了暂时躲避一下，不会别有用心。他们俩可能都没带多少钱；也许他们觉得去伦敦结婚虽然不比到苏格兰结婚来得方便，但是更节省些。”

“可是，他们为什么要偷偷摸摸呢？为什么怕人发现？为什么要秘密结婚？噢，不，不，看来不是那么回事。从简的信里便可以看得出，连他最好的朋友也觉得他根本没打算娶莉迪亚。让他和一个口袋里没钱的女人结婚，那是绝对办不到的。莉迪亚除了年轻、健康和活泼之外，还有什么别的条件或魅力能够叫他为之倾倒，甘愿为她放弃靠结婚发财的机会呢？至于他会不会因为怕这次不光彩的私奔使他在部队里丢面子，而在行为上有所收敛，我就无法判断了，因为我不知道他们走的这步棋会产生什么样的后果。就连您所说的另一条原因，恐怕也难以站得住脚。威克姆可能已经意识到，莉迪亚没有能够为她打抱不平的亲兄弟，意识到家父懒懒散散、对家里发生的事情漠不关心，遇到这类情况，一定会和其他的父亲一样不闻不问。”

“你真的以为莉迪亚因为爱他而不顾一切，居然愿意不结婚就跟他同居？”

伊丽莎白泪水涟涟地说：“说起来会让人大吃一惊，一个当姐姐的到了这种关头竟然怀疑自己的妹妹品行不正、有失检点。可是，又让我怎么说才好呢？也许，我冤枉了她。不过她的确年幼无知，从来就没正正经经地思索过人生。近半年来……不，应该说是近一年来，她终日无所事事，光知道寻欢作乐和追慕虚荣。家里姑息迁就，任她游手好闲、行为轻浮、瞎跟在别人的屁股后边打转转。自从民兵团进驻麦里屯以来，她满脑子想的都是谈情说爱、卖弄风骚和勾搭军官。她本来就已经够多情的了，但她还是口里谈爱情、心里想爱情，简直达到了如痴如醉的地步，为的是激发更大的……唉，叫我怎么说呢？……激发更大的情欲。后来她算遇上了个威克姆，那可是仪表堂堂、谈吐不凡，可以把女人家迷得颠三倒四。”

舅妈说：“简可没有把威克姆想得那么坏，觉得他不会干荒淫无耻的勾当。”

“简把谁往坏处想过？无论是什么样的人，不管他以前做过什么样的事情，除非证据确凿，否则简绝不会相信他能如此下贱。按说她和我一样，都了解威克姆是什么货色。我们都清楚，他是一个不折不扣的恶棍，既没有人格又不顾体面，一味虚情假意、花言巧语地欺骗人。”

“你真的了解他的全部底细？”加德纳太太好奇心十足，很想知道外甥女是怎么了解到这些情况的，于是问道。

伊丽莎白红着脸回答说：“我当然了解。记得那天我跟您讲过他对达西先生的无耻行径。人家待他那么宽宏大量，可您上次在浪搏恩亲眼看到他是以一副什么样的嘴脸议论人家的。还有些事情我不便讲明，也不值得说给您听。他针对彭伯里家族所造的谣言，真是多得不胜枚举。他那样诋毁达西小姐，让我满以为她一定是个傲慢冷酷、惹人讨厌的贵族小姐呢。其实，他明明知道自己在说反话。他心里比谁都清楚，达西小姐和蔼可亲，一点也不装腔作势，这些咱们都已经看了个明白。”

“莉迪亚对这些情况一无所知吗？你和简都了解得这么清楚，难道她能一直蒙在鼓里？”

“她是一无所知！糟就糟在这里。我自己也是到了肯特郡之后，和达西先生以及他的亲戚菲茨威廉上校接触多了，才了解到了事情的内幕。待我返回家中，民兵团已奉命离开麦里屯，再过一两个星期就要出发。我虽然把全部情况都告诉了简，但我们两人当时都觉得不必向外张扬。街坊四邻既然对威克姆都有好感，如果我们说出的话推翻了大家的看法，那会对谁有好处呢？甚至当莉迪亚随福斯特太太出游的事情决定下来的时候，我也没想到应该让莉迪亚了解一下威克姆的人品。我怎么就一点也没意识到，莉迪亚有可能会上他的当。您可以相信，我万万没料到会出现今天这种局面。”

“这么说，民兵团调防到布赖顿的时候，你大概还没想到他们已相互钟情了吧？”

“一点也没想到。我记得他们俩谁也没露出过相爱的迹象。这样的事情只要一露出苗头，您知道像我们那样的家庭，是绝不会等闲视之的。他最初加入民兵团的时候，莉迪亚曾经动过心，打算追求他，可我们个个都动了心呀。在头两个月里，麦里屯一带的姑娘都为他神魂颠倒。至于他本人，却从未另眼相看过莉迪亚。莉迪亚傻头傻脑地狂恋了一阵，后来也就死了心，转过头又去挑逗民兵团另外一些垂青于她的军官了。”

一路上，他们翻来覆去地谈论着这个大家都关心的话题。虽然除了忧虑、希望和猜测之外，再没有什么新的内容，但他们一接触到别的话题，马上就又会扯到这件事上来。伊丽莎白无时无刻不在思索着此事，无时无刻不在为之痛心入骨、自怨自艾。她的心里始终得不到安宁，一直在追忆着往事。

他们快马加鞭、晓行夜宿，路上只耽搁了一夜，第二天晚饭，时分便来到了浪搏恩。伊丽莎白欣慰地想到，他们好在没让简望眼欲穿，等得心急火燎。

他们驶进场院时，加德纳家的孩子们一见来了辆马车，顿时起了兴趣，都站到了台阶上观看。待马车驶到大门口，小家伙们一个个惊喜交集、眉开眼笑，情不自禁地又蹦又跳。伊丽莎白一行回到家中，首先看到的就是这种诚挚而叫人赏心悦目的欢迎场面。

她一跃跳下马车，匆匆忙忙挨个吻了孩子们，便急步奔入门厅。恰逢简从母亲的房间里出来，顺着楼梯朝下跑，在门厅里迎住了她。

姐妹俩热泪盈眶，激动地搂抱在一起。伊丽莎白迫不及待地询问，是否已打听到了私奔者的下落。

“还没有消息，”简答道，“不过现在亲爱的舅舅来了，我想一切都会好起来的。”

“爸爸进城去啦？”

“是的。正像我在信中所写的那样，他是星期二走的。”

“常收到他的来信吗？”

“只收到过一次。他星期三来了一封短信，说他已平安抵达，并根据我的特意要求，把他的地址告诉了我。除此之外，他只说等有了重要消息，再写信告诉家里。”

“妈妈的情况怎么样？你们都好吗？”

“妈妈在精神上受了些刺激，但身体还算过得去。她就在楼上的梳妆室里，见到你不知会有多高兴呢。多亏苍天保佑，玛丽和吉蒂都安然无恙。”

“可是你呢？你好吗？”伊丽莎白不由叫出了声，“你脸色苍白，真不知经受了多么大的痛苦！”

做姐姐的安慰了她一番，说自己连一点事都没有。她们姐妹俩谈话的工夫，加德纳夫妇在和自家的孩子亲热。等到那一家子亲热完，走进屋来的时候，姐妹俩只好终止了交谈。简跑上前迎接舅父舅妈，对他们千恩万谢，时而嫣然含笑，时而泪如雨下。

大家走进客厅里，舅父舅妈把伊丽莎白刚才问过的话又重新问了一遍，立刻便发现简没有掌握什么新的情况。简凭着一副仁慈的心肠，仍然满怀希望，以为事情终究会有一个美好的结局。她每天早晨都在期待接到莉迪亚或父亲的来信，指望着能从信中了解到他们的动态，指望着能听到莉迪亚结婚的消息。

大伙儿谈了一会子话，便都来到贝内特太太的房中。贝太太见到弟弟和弟媳，那副样子果然不出所料，一把鼻涕一把眼泪地说了些懊丧的话。她先把行为卑劣的威克姆骂了个狗血淋头，接着就诉说她自己遭受了多么大的磨难以及蒙受了多么大的委屈。她把每个人都抱怨了一通，却唯独没有抱怨那个应该对女儿的失足负主要责任的人。正是由于那人的溺爱纵容，才导致了今天的局面。

她说：“要是当初依了我的意思，全家人都到布赖顿去，就不会发生这档子事。我的宝贝莉迪亚真是可怜，身边没有一个人可以照顾她。福斯特两口子为什么能让她离开他们呢？怪都怪他们太漫不经心了。莉迪亚那样的女孩子要是得到精心的照料，绝不会做这种事。我一直觉得那夫妇俩不适合照管她，可人家硬是不听我的话。我的意见从来就没有被采纳过。唉，我那宝贝孩子真是可怜哪！如今贝内特先生又出门在外。我知道他找到威克姆，肯定会跟他决斗，而且肯定会被打死。那时，叫我们这一家人可怎么办呢？他的尸骨未寒，柯林斯夫妇就会把我们赶出家门。好弟弟，你要是不帮我们一把，我就不知如何是好了。”

大家一听都叫喊了起来，怪她不该把事情想得这么可怕。加德纳先生表白了他对她以及她家里人的深厚感情，然后声称他打算第二天就到伦敦去，尽一切力量协助贝内特先生寻找莉迪亚。

他还说：“不必过分惊慌。虽然应该做最坏的打算，但结局不一定很糟。他们离开布赖顿还不足一个星期。说不定几天之内就可以听到他们的消息。千万要等到我们把事情搞清楚，看他们是否已经结婚，或者搞清他们有无结婚的打算。在这之前，咱们可不能彻底绝望。我一抵达城里，就去找到姐夫，把他带到格雷斯丘奇大街的家中，然后商量一下怎么办好。”

“噢！我的好弟弟，”贝太太说，“你的一席话说到了我的心坎上。到了城里后，不管那俩年轻人躲在哪里，你都要把他们找出来呵。要是他们还没有结婚，就叫他们结婚。叫他们千万不要等着筹备好结婚礼服再举行婚礼。请转告莉迪亚，待他们成了婚，她随便要多少钱买衣服我都如数供给。最要紧的是别让贝内特先生和威克姆决斗。告诉他，就说我的状况真是糟透了。我吓得神经错乱，浑身抖得似筛糠，腰部痉挛不止，头痛欲裂，心脏嗵嗵直跳，白天黑夜都得不到休息。请你告诉我的宝贝莉迪亚，叫她不要自作主张买衣服，等见了我以后再说，因为她不清楚哪家商店最好。噢，我的弟弟，你的心眼真是太好啦！我知道你会想出办法来把事情处理得妥妥当当。”

加德纳先生又把她好言安慰了一番，说他在这件事上一定竭尽全力，同时还劝她既不要抱太大希望又不能过分担忧。大家跟她就这么谈了一阵子话，等到晚饭摆上桌的时候，便一个个离开了她。反正女儿们不在跟前，有女管家服侍她，听她倾吐胸中的烦恼。

弟弟和弟媳虽然觉得她没必要和家里人分开进餐，但却没有反对这样做。因为他们知道她说话不谨慎，上大饭桌吃饭信口开河胡诌起来，容易让在一旁侍候的用人们见笑。故而，他们觉得最好只让一位用人，一位靠得住的用人侍候她用餐，听她抒发对这件事的担忧以及牵挂。

大家来到餐厅不久，玛丽和吉蒂也走了进来。这两姐妹都在自己的房间里忙自己的事，一个看书，一个化妆，因而没有早一点出来和大伙儿照面。她们的脸色都相当平静，看不出有什么变化，只是吉蒂说话的腔调比平时显得有些烦躁，这或许是因为她丢了个妹妹而感到伤心，或许是由于这件丑事也激起了她胸中的怒火。至于玛丽，还算沉得住气，等大家在桌旁坐定后，她便摆出一副老谋深算的样子，悄声对伊丽莎白说：

“家门不幸，遭此大难。外边的人很可能会议论纷纷，在这件事上大做文章。咱们一定要携起手来，共渡难关，以姐妹之情安抚彼此受伤的心灵。”

她见伊丽莎白没有搭话的意思，于是便继续说道：“这件不幸的事情虽发生在莉迪亚身上，但咱们大家都可引为前车之鉴。女儿家一旦失身，就再也无法挽救，正所谓一失足成千古恨。要想保住美貌不是件容易的事，而保全名节亦为艰难。对轻薄的男儿，万万不可掉以轻心。”

伊丽莎白听后，诧异地抬起了眼睛，只是心情过于沉重，一句话也答不上来。玛丽却不管那一套，只顾针对这件邪恶的事情进行道德说教，以便聊以自慰。

到了下午，贝家的两个大小姐总算找到了半个小时的时间单独谈话。伊丽莎白连珠炮似的提了一连串问题，而简一一给予答复。两人凄凄哀哀，长吁短叹。伊丽莎白认为这件事必然会产生可怕的后果，简也觉得不可以完全排除这种可能性。伊丽莎白嗟叹了一番之后，又继续说道：“有些情况我还不了解，请你详详细细讲给我听。把事情说得再具体一些。福斯特上校是怎么说的？那两人私奔之前，难道就没有露出点什么苗头吗？他们幽会时，一定被人瞧见过。”

“福斯特上校承认，他曾怀疑过那两人感情缠绵，特别是莉迪亚最为可疑，可是却没有因此而引起警觉。我真为他感到难过！他待人关怀备至，和蔼可亲。事情一发生，他就要赶来安慰我们，当时他还不知道那两人压根没去苏格兰。等到他弄清情况后，他便快马加鞭来到了这里。”

“丹尼敢肯定威克姆不打算结婚吗？他是否提前就知道那俩有私奔的企图？福斯特上校找他本人谈过吗？”

“找过。可是在问及那两人的计划时，丹尼推说什么也不知道，硬是不肯讲心里的话。他只字没有再提那两人根本不打算结婚之类的话。依此看来，我倒希望先前是别人误解了他的意思。”

“在福斯特上校来这儿之前，我想，你们从来就没怀疑过他俩不是真心要结婚吧？”

“谁会产生这样的念头呢？我只是有点惴惴不安，怕妹妹嫁给他不会幸福，因为我知道他历来行为不轨。爸爸和妈妈不了解他的为人，只觉得这门亲事过于轻率。吉蒂比我们了解内情，扬扬得意地告诉我们，莉迪亚在给她的最后一封信中曾声称准备采取这一招。看样子，她似乎在几星期之前，就已经知道了他俩在相爱。”

“她总不会在他们去布赖顿以前就知道吧？”

“我想，那倒不至于。”

“福斯特上校本人对威克姆是不是也没有好的看法？他了解不了解威克姆的真正品行？”

“我必须承认，他与以前的口吻大不一样，净说威克姆的不是，把他描绘成一个行为轻率、生活奢侈的人。这次悲惨的事件发生之后，人们传言说，威克姆在麦里屯负债累累。我真希望这只是谣言。”

“简啊简，咱们当初要是不那么守口如瓶，把他的过去抖搂出去，就不会发生今天的事情了！”

“兴许会有所帮助，”做姐姐的答道，“不过，要是不顾人家现在的想法如何，就去揭人家以前的短处，似乎有些不近人情。咱们那样做是问心无愧的。”

“福斯特上校难道能记得清莉迪亚留给他妻子的那封短信，把内容一五一十说给你们听吗？”

“他把信拿了来让我们看哩。”简说完，把信从衣袋里掏出来，递给伊丽莎白。全文如下：


亲爱的哈丽亚特：

明天早晨你发现我没有了踪影，一定会大吃一惊。待你弄清我的去向之后，难免会捧腹大笑。一想到你那副滑稽的样子，连我自己都忍俊不禁。我要去的地方是格雷特纳格林。你要是猜不出我的旅伴是何人，我可真要把你看做一个大傻瓜了，因为这个世界上我只爱一个男人，他是我的天使。我离了他绝不会幸福，所以觉得同他一道出走总不会有什么坏处。如果你认为不便的话，可以先不要把这消息告知浪搏恩我的家人。到时候我给他们写信，签名用“莉迪亚·威克姆”，准叫他们感到意外。这个玩笑真是太有味道啦！我笑得肚子疼，简直再也写不下去了。请代我向普拉特道声歉，就说我今晚不能赴约，不能和他跳舞了。请告诉他，我希望他在了解了事情的来龙去脉之后，能够原谅我。还要烦请转告他，我们下一次舞会重逢时，我将十分愿意跟他同舞共乐。我到了浪搏恩就派人来取衣服。希望你对萨利说一声，我那件细纱长礼服上绽开一条大缝，让她替我收拾行李时把它补一补。再见。请代我问候福斯特上校。但愿你们能为我们干杯，祝愿我们一路顺风。

你忠诚的朋友

莉迪亚·贝内特



“唉，好一个没头脑的莉迪亚！真是太欠思考！”伊丽莎白看完信，连声叫了起来，“在那样的时刻，竟写出这等信来！不过，她起码表明了自己的心迹，证明她是认真对待这次私奔的。不管威克姆以后诱惑她干出了什么事，她当初可不是存心要丢大家的脸。可怜的爸爸！他心里该是个什么滋味呀！”

“我从未见过任何人像爸爸那般震惊。他呆若木鸡，整整十分钟一句话也讲不出来。妈妈当下就病倒了，家里全乱了套！”

“糟糕！”伊丽莎白失声叫道，“简，家里的用人该不是当天就把这件事情了解得清清楚楚了吧？”

“不知道。但愿事实并非如此。不过，在那种时候，要想严守秘密真是难得很呵。妈妈的歇斯底里毛病又发作起来。我十分想尽我的一切力量帮助她，然而却力不从心，唯恐照顾不周！我只怕会生出什么意外，因而差点吓得乱了方寸。”

“你拼全身心去照料她，真够你戗的。你的脸色看上去不太好。所有的事务都由你一人处理，所有的忧虑都由你一人承担。唉，我要是和你在一起就好啦！”

“玛丽和吉蒂都挺懂事，很想替我分担一切，可是我觉得于心不忍。吉蒂弱不禁风、身板单薄；而玛丽学习太刻苦，有那么点休息时间，不应该占用。爸爸出门后，菲利普斯姨妈星期二那天来过。承蒙她的好心，陪我一直住到星期四才走。她给了我们很大的帮助和安慰。卢卡斯太太也有一副菩萨心肠，星期三早晨跑来安慰我们，说如果用得上的话，她和她的女儿们随时愿为我们效劳。”

“她待在自己家里会更好些，”伊丽莎白大声嚷道，“她也许是出于好意，但是遇到这种不幸的事情，对于左邻右舍还是少见为妙。要让她们帮忙是不可能的，而接受她们的安慰只会增加我们的痛苦。所以，最好叫她们躲得远远的，在一旁幸灾乐祸。”

接着，她又问起父亲这次到城里去，打算采用什么方法寻找莉迪亚的下落。

简说：“我想，他打算到埃普瑟姆去，因为那两人在那儿换过马车。他想找到马车夫，看从他们口中能问出些什么。他的主要目的可能是查出克拉帕姆的那辆出租马车的牌号。那辆车是从伦敦来的，上面坐着乘客。据他看来，一男一女换乘马车，很可能会引起旁人的注意。所以他要到克拉帕姆探个究竟。他准备先打听出马车夫把伦敦的客人送到了哪家旅店，然后到那儿询问，或许能够查清停车地点以及马车牌号。至于他还有什么别的计划，我就不得而知了。他走得匆忙，心绪又不安宁，就连这些情况我也是费了许多气力才问出来的。”





第四十八章


第二天早上，大家都指望能收到贝内特先生的信，可是等到邮差来了，却没有带来他的只字片纸。家里人知道他平时懒懒散散，能不写信就尽量不写信，但在这非常时刻，她们指望着他会打起精神，勤给家里通情况。既然不见信来，大家只得认为他没有好消息值得报告。但即便如此，她们还是希望能掌握确切的信息。加德纳先生临行之前，一心盼望着能看到他的来信。

加德纳先生上路的时候，大伙儿都觉得心里踏实了些，认为自此至少可以随时了解事态的发展情况了。他辞别的时候，答应尽力而为，劝说贝先生回归浪搏恩。做姐姐的听后，总算放下了心，因为她觉得唯有这样才能保住丈夫的命，使他不至于在决斗中丧生。

加德纳太太带着孩子们还要在哈福德郡再住几日，因为她觉得自己在跟前，可以为外甥女们排忧解难。她和她们一道服侍贝内特太太，待闲下来的时候，还可以安慰她们。姨妈也三天两头来看望贝家的小姐们，按她自己的话说，一来是给她们解解闷，二来是为她们宽宽心。她每次来都要抨击一通威克姆骄奢淫逸的生活作风，而且回回都举出一些新事例来。但她走之后，外甥女们往往比她来之前更加意气消沉。

三个月之前，麦里屯人人有口皆碑，差不多把威克姆捧到了天上，而现在众口铄金，一齐说他的坏话。人们指责他债台高筑，在每个商人那儿都欠了钱，还给他加上勾引妇女的罪名，说他在每个有钱人家都干过偷香窃玉的勾当。人人都说他是天下最坏的青年，个个都声称自己早就看出他是个道貌岸然的伪君子。伊丽莎白对这些话只是半信半疑，但她早就断定妹妹会毁在此人手中，现在更加坚定了自己的看法。就连不大相信传言的简也有些绝望了。因为时间已过去这么久，如果他们俩到了苏格兰（她一直对此抱有一线希望），现在该有他们的消息了。

加德纳先生是星期天离开浪搏恩的。星期二，他妻子接到他的一封来信。信上说，他一抵达伦敦就找到了姐夫，劝他随自己来到了格雷斯丘奇街。他还说在他未到之前，贝内特先生曾去过埃普瑟姆和克拉帕姆，只可惜没打听到一点叫人满意的消息。贝先生目前准备到城里的各大旅馆去打听，因为他觉得，那一对情种初来伦敦，在未找到住房之前，很可能会在旅馆下榻。加德纳先生本人并不指望这样做会有所收获，但既然姐夫一意孤行，他也只好助姐夫一臂之力了。信上还说，贝内特先生眼下似乎根本没有离开伦敦的意图。加德纳先生表示，他马上还会再写一封信来。他在信的末尾又缀了这样一段话：


我已写信给福斯特上校，请他尽力向民兵团里威克姆的好友打听一下，看威克姆是否有什么亲友知道他躲在城里的哪个区域。如果能找到一个有可能提供这种线索的人，事情就可以出现重大转机。就目前而言，我们只是瞎碰乱撞，心里没一点谱。我敢肯定，福斯特上校将会不遗余力地帮助我们。不过，我又仔细想了想，觉得丽茨也许比任何其他人都了解情况，可以告诉我们他有哪些亲属。



伊丽莎白一点也不糊涂，知道舅舅为何这般信赖她。可惜她无力提供令人满意的信息，白白辜负了舅舅的期望。她只知道威克姆有父有母，而且已辞世多年，除此之外，她再没听说过他还有别的亲属。不过，他在民兵团的战友或许能说出些新情况来。她对这一点虽然不十分乐观，但觉得打听一下或许还会带来希望。浪搏恩一家人的每一天都是在焦虑中度过，但是最叫人焦灼不安的还是等待邮差的那段时间，而且天天如此。每天早晨她们都急巴巴地企盼有信来。不管信里讲的是好消息还是坏消息，她们都会相互转告，而且期待第二天会有重要的消息传来。

谁想还没接到加德纳先生的第二封信，她们却先收到了另外一个人的来信，那是柯林斯先生写给贝内特先生的。简事先受到嘱托，父亲外出期间由她代为拆阅一切信件，因此她便打开了柯林斯的信。伊丽莎白知道柯林斯的信历来写得古里古怪，于是便凑到姐姐身旁，和她一起读起信来。信是这样写的：


尊敬的先生：

昨日接哈福德郡一封书信，方知先生横遭飞祸，陷凄惨之绝境。在下念及亲戚情分以及自身的社会地位，对你们的处境深表同情。请先生相信，在下及内人对您及尊府之老幼，均深深挂念。此次事件乃天下之大不幸，叫人痛心疾首，家风蒙垢，永无清洗之日，伤父母之心，犹此为重。早知如此，但祈令嫒早夭为幸耳。不佞唯有曲尽其辞，庶几可以聊宽尊怀。据内人夏洛特所言，令嫒此次放荡于形，实系平日过分纵容所致，可悲且可叹。在下以为，令嫒虽未及成年，便铸成大错，亦足见其天性之顽劣，故而先生及太太不必引咎自责。尽管如此，您们亦是可悲，值得同情。在下及内人见解无异，而凯瑟琳夫人与其千金明原委之余，也持相同之见。我们一致认为，令嫒一人失足，却殃及其他，致使尊府上下受辱。恰如凯瑟琳夫人所言：何人肯与这般人家攀亲结缘？念及此因，在下思绪潮涌，忆及去年十一月间一事，则又深感庆幸，否则木已成舟，势必自取其辱，受累匪浅。敬祈先生善自宽慰，斩断父女之情思，任顽女自食其恶果。

祝先生大安……



加德纳先生直待接到福斯特上校的回音以后，才发来了第二封信，而且信中没有报告一点喜讯，据了解，威克姆没有来往的亲戚，他的至亲全都离开了人世。他从前倒是交游甚广，但自从进了民兵团之后，便和朋友们日趋疏远，因此找不出一个人可以提供他的消息。他这次严守秘密，一是因为他欠了一屁股的赌债，而他手头拮据，无力偿还；二是因为他怕莉迪亚的亲友发现他们的去向。福斯特上校认为，要偿清他在布赖顿的债务，需要有一千多英镑才够。他在本镇借了许多账，而赌债更为可观。加德纳先生毫不隐瞒，把这些情况都告诉了浪搏恩的小姐们。简读完信惊骇万状，不由嚷嚷道：“他原来是个赌棍！真是出乎意料。我想也不曾想到。”

加德纳先生在信上还提到，她们的父亲于明日（星期六）便可回到家中。贝先生虽经多方努力，但一无所获，结果弄得精神沮丧，最后只好答应了内弟的请求，立刻回家，而留下内弟相机行事，继续查寻。贝家小姐们本以为母亲既是那般为父亲的性命牵肠挂肚，听到这消息，一定会面露喜色，谁知事情并非如此。

“怎么，没有找到可怜的莉迪亚，他就这么回家来？”贝内特太太嚷道，“在没有把事情了结之前，他不应该离开伦敦。他一走，还有谁去跟威克姆决斗，逼他和莉迪亚结婚呢？”

此时，加德纳太太提出想回到伦敦的家中。于是大家商定，就在贝先生从伦敦启程的同一天，叫她带孩子们上路。这样，马车可以把他们母子送到第一站，然后把浪搏恩的主人接回来。

加德纳太太临走时还弄不清伊丽莎白和她那位德比郡的朋友之间的关系。其实，从当初在德比郡的时候起，她就一直糊里糊涂，不知所以然。在他们夫妇面前，伊丽莎白从未主动提过那人的名字。加德纳太太原以为他会寄信来，但这一线希望却化成了泡影。伊丽莎白回家后，一直没有收到从彭伯里发来的信。

目前家门惨遭不幸，伊丽莎白自然情绪低落，用不着从别的方面寻找原因。因此，做舅妈的仍是一个闷葫芦，摸不透她的心思。不过，伊丽莎白倒是明白了自己对达西的情感。要是她与达西素不相识，莉迪亚所干下的丑事就不至于叫她这么伤心得死去活来了，也就不至于让她度过了这许许多多不眠之夜了。

贝内特先生回到家，还是平素的那种泰然自若的模样。他像往常一样少言寡语，绝口不提那件迫使他远离家门的事情。女儿们有些发毛，半天都不敢接触正题。

到了下午，他和家里人一道用茶点时，伊丽莎白才鼓了鼓勇气，贸然提起了那件事。接着，她说父亲为此呕心沥血，想起来让她感到难过。贝先生听了，急忙说：“这话就别提了。这种苦应该让我承受，没有旁人的责任。事情都是由我造成的，所以我理当喝下这杯苦酒。”

“您不必过分苛责自己。”伊丽莎白劝道。

“你劝我也是白劝，因为人之天性就是自怨自艾！丽茨呵，我这一辈子都没做过亏心事，现在就让我承担一次罪名吧。我绝不会被困难所压倒的。事情很快就会风平浪静的。”

“据您看来，他们会在伦敦吗？”

“是的。要是在别的地方，哪能藏得这么隐蔽？”

“莉迪亚早就想去伦敦了。”吉蒂在一旁插嘴说。

“这下她可如愿以偿啦，”父亲冰冷冷地说，“她在那儿或许要住上一阵子呢。”

沉默了片刻之后，他又接着说：“丽茨，五月间你那样劝我是有道理的，我一点也不怨你。从这件事情看来，你还真有远见卓识哩。”

这时，简走过来给母亲端茶，打断了他们的谈话。

贝内特先生大声叫了起来：“你妈妈摆摆架子也有好处。真所谓倒了霉还不忘风雅！哪一天我也学学她的样子，头戴睡帽，身穿睡衣，躲在书房里吆三喝四地使唤人。……也许，等吉蒂跟人私奔时，我真会那样做。”

“我才不私奔呢，爸爸，”吉蒂气恼地说，“如果我到布赖顿去，一定比莉迪亚规矩。”

“哼，让你到布赖顿去！就是给我五十镑钱，连伊斯特本那么近的地方，我也不敢放你去！得啦，吉蒂，我现在至少学会了谨慎行事，以后就会让你知道我的手段。凡是军官，再也不许踏人我的门槛，甚至休想从村子里走过。绝对不许你再参加舞会，要想跳就和你的姐姐们跳。每天你都必须规规矩矩地干上十分钟的明白事，否则你就休想迈出家门一步。”

吉蒂听完这一通恫吓，信以为真，不由哭了起来。

“别哭啦，别哭啦，”贝内特先生说，“不必这样伤心嘛。假如你在今后的十年中能够老老实实做人，等到十年期满的时候，我带你再看阅兵式。”





第四十九章


贝内特先生回到家中已有两日了。这天，简和伊丽莎白正在屋后的矮树林里散步，忽然看见女管家朝她们走了过来。她们以为是母亲找她们有事，于是便迎上前去。但是，到了女管家跟前，才发现并非母亲要找她们。只听女管家对简说：“小姐，请原谅我搅了你们的雅兴。我想你们兴许听到了从城里传来的好消息，这才冒昧来询问详情。”

“你在说什么呀，希尔？我们没听说城里有什么消息呀。”

“亲爱的小姐，”希尔太太惊愕地失声叫了起来，“你们难道不知道加德纳先生派人送来了一封急信？那人已经来了半个小时啦，而信让主人拿走了。”

两位姑娘一听，拔腿就往回跑，急慌慌地连话也顾不上说了。她们穿厅过堂，一路跑进餐厅，又从那儿寻到书房，到处都不见父亲的影子。她们正要上楼到母亲那儿找他，却恰巧碰上了男管家。只听男管家说道：

“小姐，你们是在找主人吧，他朝小树林那边去了。”

两位姑娘听到这话，立刻又从原路跑出去，穿过草坪，去追赶她们的父亲。而贝先生这时正不慌不忙地向围场旁边的小树林那儿走着。

简不像伊丽莎白那般轻盈，也不如她善于奔跑，所以很快就落到了后边。伊丽莎白上气不接下气地追上父亲，迫不及待地嚷道：“爸爸！是什么消息？是什么消息？您接到舅舅的来信了吧？”

“是的。我收到了他的一封信，是专人送来的。”

“快说说，信里都讲些什么——好消息还是坏消息？”

“哪会有什么好消息呢？”贝先生说着，从衣袋里掏出了信，“不过，你也许有兴致看一看。”

伊丽莎白性急地把信从他手中一把拿了过来。此刻，简也赶了上来。

“你就念念吧，”做父亲的说，“我从信中几乎看不出个什么名堂来。”


亲爱的姐夫：

终于能够告诉你一些外甥女的消息了，希望大体上能让你感到满意。你星期六走后不久，我便时来运转，查出了他们在伦敦的住址。详情容以后面谈。你只要知道已查出他们的下落，就可以放心了。我看到了他们俩……



“事情果真像我所盼望的那样，”简没待念完，便嚷嚷了起来，“这一下他们总算结婚啦！”

伊丽莎白继续朝下念道：


我见是见到了他们，可他们并没有结婚，而且好像也没有结婚的意图。不过我擅自代你作出了承诺，如果你愿意履行的话，我想他们不久便会结下这门亲事。你必须做到以下几点：向你的女儿依法作出保证，待你和姐姐归天之后，留给孩子们的五千镑遗产有她的一份；另外，你还必须保证，你在世时每年补贴她一百镑。经过通盘考虑，我认为自己有权为你做主，于是便毫不犹豫地答应了这些条件。我派专人送这封信件，以便尽早得到你的回音。从这些情况中，你很容易便能看得出，威克姆并不像大家所想象的那样到了山穷水尽的地步。在这一点上，所有人的判断都是错误的。我可以高兴地告诉你，威克姆不必动用外甥女名下的财产，便可还清债务，而且还可以给她余下一些钱。你如果愿意根据我所说的情况，让我全权代表你处理此事，那我马上就吩咐哈格斯顿去办理有关手续。你大可不必再进城，安安宁宁待在浪搏恩就行了。请你放心，我一定花气力，把事情办妥当。请你务必尽快写回信，并且要把你的意思写明白些。我们认为，最好让外甥女从我们家出嫁，希望你会应允。她今天要到这里来。若有其他情况，我将随时奉告。

你的

爱德华·加德纳

写于格雷斯丘奇街

8月2日，星期一



“这可能吗？”伊丽莎白读完信后，大声叫喊道，“威克姆真的会跟她结婚？”

“咱们把他瞧低了。看来他不是个无情无义的人，”姐姐说道，“亲爱的爸爸，我向您道喜呵。”

“回信写过了吗？”伊丽莎白问。

“还没有。不过这回信得马上就写。”

伊丽莎白一听，恳切地请求父亲赶紧写信，一点时间都不能耽误。

“快点，亲爱的爸爸！”她嚷道，“现在就回去写信吧。事情紧迫，一分一秒都耽搁不得。”

“如果您不愿意动笔，那就让我代劳吧。”简说。

“我是极端不愿意动笔，可是不写又不成。”父亲答道。

他一边说，一边随女儿们转过身来，向家里走去。

“我想问一句……至于那些条件，大概算答应下来了吧？”伊丽莎白问。

“怎能不答应！我只是觉得有些脸发烧，想不到他的要求那么低。”

“看来他们非结婚不可啦！遗憾的是，他不是一个正人君子！”

“是呀，是呀，现在覆水难收，没有别的办法了。不过，这里有两件事情我很想弄个明白：第一，你们的舅舅究竟花了多少钱财才把事情办到了这种地步；第二，我以后怎样才能还他的情。”

“难道舅舅真塞了钱！？”简嚷道，“您到底在说什么呀，爸爸？”

“即便答应了他们的条件，我活的时候每年能给莉迪亚一百镑的用项，而死后每年却只能给她五十镑。一个头脑正常的男人绝不会贪图这一点小利，娶莉迪亚为妻。”

“这话一点不假，”伊丽莎白说，“我怎么以前就没想到呢？威克姆还清债务之后，竟然还能略有节余！噢，一定是舅舅在当中垫了钱！他真是一个慷慨大方的好人呀。怕只怕他苦了自己。像这么棘手的事情，钱数小了是解绝不了问题的。”

“是呀，”父亲说道，“威克姆又不是傻瓜，出价少于一万镑，他是不会娶莉迪亚的。刚和他有了一点缘分，就这么猜忌他，想起来实在叫人难过。”

“一万英镑！这怎么可能呀！这么多钱，就是一半咱们也还不起吧？”

贝内特先生没有回答。父女三人各自都心事重重，默默无语地朝前走。回到家里，父亲钻进书房去写回信，而两个大女儿走进了餐厅。

“他们真的要结婚啦！”伊丽莎白见四周没人，不由喊了起来，“好一桩咄咄怪事！咱们还得为此感激涕零呢。尽管他们不大可能获得幸福，尽管威克姆的品格那么恶劣，他们照样还得结为夫妻，而我们照样得为之欢欣鼓舞。唉，莉迪亚呀！”

“我倒是觉得，”简说，“他是真心爱恋莉迪亚，否则绝不会跟她结婚。好心的舅舅或许帮他清还了一些债务，但我怎么也不会相信舅舅竟垫付了一万英镑。他家里养了一群孩子，以后还可能会再添人口。一万镑的钱，就是让他拿出一半来，他又怎么能办得到？”

“假如能查清威克姆究竟欠了多少债，”伊丽莎白说，“查清他打算给咱们的妹妹多少钱，便可以知道舅舅为他们花掉了多少钞票，因为那个威克姆是连一个子儿也拿不出来的。舅舅和舅妈的恩情今生今世也报答不了。他们把莉迪亚接回家去，亲自保护她，为她挽回面子，不知要作出多大的努力，真让她一辈子感恩不尽呢。莉迪亚现在已经和他们在一起了！倘若这样的一片好心还不能使她悔悟，那她永远也不配得到幸福！她猛地一见到舅妈，心里不知会有什么感慨呢！”

简说：“咱们应该把他们俩做过的事情尽力忘掉。我希望，并且也相信他们会过上幸福的日子。他既然答应跟她结婚，这就证明他已经端正了意识，能够正确地考虑问题了。他们相亲相爱，最终十定会循规蹈矩。我相信他们俩从此会过一种安安稳稳、平平静静的生活，到时候人们也就会淡忘他们以前的荒唐行为。”

伊丽莎白答道：“这样安慰自己是不顶用的。他们干出了那样的事情，无论是你我，或是其他的人，都不会轻易忘掉的。”

姐妹俩说到这里，突然想到她们的母亲很可能还蒙在鼓里，不知道这件事情呢。于是，她们寻到书房征求父亲的意见，问他能不能把此事告知母亲。父亲正在写信，连头也没抬，只是淡漠地说：

“随你们的便。”

“能不能把舅舅的信拿去给她念念？”

“愿拿什么就拿什么。请别打搅我啦。”

伊丽莎白从他的写字台上取过信，和姐姐一道上楼去了。碰巧，玛丽和吉蒂都在贝太太的房间里。这样，只要把事情一公布，大家也就全知道了。简轻描淡写地说了声有好消息，接着便开始念信，叫贝太太简直有些喜不自禁。当她念到莉迪亚有希望马上结婚那一段时，贝太太顿时心花怒放，以后每念一句，贝太太的喜悦便增加一分。以前她惶惶不安、郁郁寡欢，而现在却喜气洋洋，高兴得有些飘飘然。一听说女儿将要结婚，她按捺不住心头的快感。她没有为女儿的幸福担心，也没有为女儿行为的不检点而感到丢脸。

“我的宝贝莉迪亚啊！”她不由叫嚷了起来，“这是一个多么振奋人心的消息！……她就要嫁人啦！……我又要见到她啦！……她才十六岁，就要当新娘啦！……多亏了我那善良的好弟弟！我知道事情会有这么个结局，知道天下没有他办不到的事情！我多么想立刻见到莉迪亚和亲爱的威克姆啊！不过她的衣服，她的结婚礼服还没置办好！我得立即写信跟弟媳谈谈。丽茨，乖孩子，快下楼去找你的父亲，问他愿给多少嫁妆。等等，等等。还是让我亲自去吧。吉蒂，摇铃把希尔唤来。我马上就能穿好衣服。我的好宝贝莉迪亚啊！……我们母女俩久别重逢，不知会有多高兴呢！”

大女儿见她心情过于激动，有意想引开她的思路，让她放松一下，于是便讲起了加德纳先生对她们全家的恩典。

“多亏了舅舅的热心帮忙，才算有了今天这种圆满的结局。”她说道，“我们都认为，他向威克姆先生许过诺，答应出钱资助他。”

母亲嚷道：“这是理所当然的。除了自己的舅舅，谁还肯帮这种忙？你们要知道，他要是没有家小的话，肯定会把自己的钱全都给我和我的孩子花。我们以前只是接收过他的一些礼物，而现在是破天荒第一次动用他的钱。呵！我真是太高兴啦！我的一个女儿马上就要嫁人啦。哈，威克姆太太！叫起来多动听啊！她六月份才满十六岁，亲爱的简，我的心情太激动啦，恐怕写不好信。索性由我口授，你来代笔吧。关于钱款事宜，咱们过后跟你父亲商量。但衣物嫁妆必须马上订好。”

接着，她列举了各种名目的布料，什么细洋纱、印花布以及麻纱啦。恨不得一下子把样样货色都订购上。简好不容易才劝住了她，让她等父亲闲下来后和他商量一下再决定，说迟上一半天都关系不大。贝太太心里高兴得不得了，所以没有像往常那样固执己见。再说，她的脑子里又盘算起了别的事情。

只听她说道：“我一穿好衣服，就到麦里屯去，把这条好消息告诉给我的妹妹菲利普斯太太。从那儿回来，我就去拜望卢卡斯太太和朗太太。吉蒂，快去叫人把马车备好。出去透透空气，对我会大有好处。姑娘们，我到麦里屯去，有什么事需要我代劳吗？哦，希尔来啦。亲爱的希尔，你听到好消息了没有？莉迪亚小姐就要结婚啦。到时候请你喝喜酒，大家好好乐一乐。”

希尔太太立刻面露喜色，向伊丽莎白等人一一祝贺。后来，伊丽莎白对这一套愚蠢的把戏实在看不过眼，索性躲进了自己的房间图个清静，打算把事情好好思量思量。

莉迪亚的处境是够糟糕的了，但好在还没有糟得不可收拾，光冲这一点她就得感到庆幸。按说，她确存庆幸之心。虽说一想到今后，她觉得妹妹既难获得应有的幸福，又难享受到世俗的荣华富贵，但是回想起刚才的情形，就在两个小时之前她还忧心如焚，相比之下，她认为事情能有一个这样的收场，该是不幸中之大幸了。





第五十章


贝内特先生老早就产生过一个愿望，想着从每年的进项中省下一部分钱来，将来能让孩子们过上好日子。这样做，如果太太的阳寿比他长，衣食也能有个着落。现在，他的这个愿望比以往任何时候都强烈。假如他在这方面早做安排，莉迪亚就用不着仰仗舅舅的财力替她争面子和挽回荣誉了。倘若他有了钱，也就用不着劳驾别人去说服一个全英国最无耻的青年做莉迪亚的丈夫了。

这件事本来对谁都没有好处，可如今却得由内弟一人掏腰包承办，这叫他心里实在过意不去。他决心尽一切力量查出内弟到底帮了多大的忙，也好赶快了结这笔人情债。

他在刚结婚的时候，完全用不着省吃俭用，因为他们夫妇满以为会生个儿子。等到儿子成了年。便可以堂堂正正继承遗产，家里的弟妹和寡母也就衣食无虑了。可是，他们两口子接连生下了五个女儿，始终不见儿子降临人世。莉迪亚出世许多年之后，贝内特太太还指望着能生儿子呢。后来，他们终于死了心，可是要想攒钱已为时过晚了。贝太太过日子不善于精打细算，好在丈夫有点心计，才算使家里没有入不敷出。

当年，他们的婚约上曾注明，贝内特太太和子女们可享有五千镑遗产。至于子女们如何分配这笔钱，得取决于父母的意志。这个问题现在被提了出来，起码得立刻决定怎样处理莉迪亚的那一份钱财。贝内特先生没敢迟疑，当下就准备同意内弟的建议。他以简单扼要的文字在回信中感谢了内弟的热心帮助，表示赞同他所做的一切努力，愿意履行他代为作出的承诺。他怎么也没料到会有今天这么圆满的结局，没料到他本人只需作一点小小的让步便可以让威克姆娶他的女儿。虽说他每年得支给他们一百镑，但一年下来还损失不了十镑呢。因为莉迪亚在家里住，她的衣食费用和零花钱，再加上母亲三天两头给她买礼品的钱，算下来也差不多有一百镑了。

这件事还有一个叫人喜出望外的地方，那就是他自己不用花多少气力。按他现在的想法，麻烦越少就越好。起初，他带着满腔的怒火四处寻找莉迪亚，而今却气平怒消，这样他就自然而然恢复了他的懒散劲儿。不过那封信倒是很快就发出去了，因为他做事虽然喜欢拖拉，可一旦动起手来，却也有几分雷厉风行的精神。他请求内弟把详细情况告诉他，看看自己欠内弟到底有多大的情分。莉迪亚太让他生气了，所以他在信中连问候莉迪亚一声也没有。

好消息不胫而走，立刻传遍了全府上下，随后这风又吹到了邻居们的耳朵里。好在四邻八舍对这件事都抱着豁达圣明的态度。当然，如果莉迪亚·贝内特小姐突如其来地回到故乡来，或者远离尘嚣，在一幢偏远的家舍里隐居下来，邻居们肯定会有文章可做，对她说三道四。即便出现今天这种情况，人们也会对她的出嫁议论纷纷。麦里屯的那些老妇人真够讨厌的，以前见了她就絮絮叨叨地祝她嫁个如意郎君，现在形势发生了变化，就一个劲地说些难听的话了，因为她们觉得莉迪亚跟着这样一个丈夫，必定落个悲惨的下场。

贝内特太太已经有两个星期没下楼了。如今遇到大喜日子，她又一次坐到了首席的位置，情绪显得异常高涨。她一脸得意的神气，丝毫没有羞耻感。自从简满十六岁的那年起，嫁女儿成了她的第一大心愿，而今眼看就要如愿以偿了。她把一门心思都放到了莉迪亚身上，嘴里讲的尽是男婚女嫁的必需品——诸如上好的细纹纱、崭新的马车以及男仆女婢等。她的脑子转来转去，想为女儿在附近寻个适当的安家之处。她不知道，也不考虑他们的经济情况，硬是把许多房屋都给否定了，不是嫌狭小，就是嫌不够气派。

只听她说：“要是古尔丁一家能搬走，海耶庄园倒是不错。斯托克宅院还可以，但美中不足的是客厅略微小了些。阿什沃思不能考虑，那地方太远了！莉迪亚住的房子距离我绝不能超过十英里。至于珀维斯住宅，那儿的阁楼真是糟糕透啦。”

由于用人们在跟前，她丈夫没有打断她的话，任她滔滔不绝地朝下讲。但用人们一下去，丈夫便对她说道：“贝内特太太，你为女儿和女婿租房子，随便你租哪一幢，就是把它们全租下来也可以，但首先咱们得把话说清楚，在这一带，唯有一处房屋不许他们搬进去住，那就是浪搏恩府邸。我可不愿在家里接待他们，助长他们的嚣张气焰。”

此话一出口，两人便争吵不休，但贝先生态度坚决，不肯妥协。随即，他们又为另一件事争得脸红脖子粗。贝太太听丈夫说不愿出一文钱为女儿购置衣服，不禁感到又震惊又害怕。贝先生声称，这一次莉迪亚休想得到他的半点疼爱，这叫他的太太实在无法理解。她万万没料到，丈夫对女儿竟然如此深恶痛绝，连一点面子也不给她，不肯让她顺顺当当地嫁人。她只知道女儿出嫁没有新衣服是件丢脸的事情，可是对于她的私奔，对于她婚前跟威克姆同居了两个星期，却丝毫也不感到羞耻。

伊丽莎白现在十分后悔，怨自己当初不该出于一时的痛快，竟把心里对妹妹的满腹忧虑全告诉了达西先生。既然妹妹可以名正言顺地结婚嫁人，就能够结束私奔所引起的那一段风流孽债。那么，开头那点不体面的事情，当然最好能瞒过局外人士。

她并不是害怕达西把事情张扬出去。要论保守秘密，没有谁比达西更能使她信任的了。不过，这一次如果是别的人知道了她妹妹的丑行，她绝不会像现在这样难过。她倒不是担心对她自己有什么不利之处，因为她和达西之间反正隔着一条不可逾越的鸿沟。即便莉迪亚能够体面地结婚，达西也绝不会跟这样的人家攀亲，因为这家人原来的缺点就已经够多了，而今又添了一个他所不齿的人做至亲。

达西要是对这门亲事望而却步，一点也不会让她感到奇怪。在德比郡的时候，她看得出他对她含情脉脉，一味地想博得她的欢心。但经过了这次打击之后，他的情感很可能会烟消云散。伊丽莎白觉得丢脸，觉得伤心。同时，她的心里还产生了几分懊悔，尽管她弄不清楚自己都懊悔些什么。她已经不再指望他会敬慕她，但是却对他恋恋不舍。她渴望了解他的近况，然而他那边却音讯全无。他们今生今世也可能再也无缘相见。直到这时，她才意识到，如能和他一起生活，将是一种幸福。

仅仅四个月之前，她高傲地拒绝了他的求婚。如果他现在再次求婚，她一定会怀着喜悦和感激接受下来。她常常在想，这些情况让他知道了，谁晓得他会多么得意呢！她毫不怀疑，他是一个气度宽宏的男子。可他毕竟是个凡夫俗子，免不了会沾沾自喜。

她现在开始省悟到，无论从性情还是才能而言，他都和她极端般配。他的见识和脾气虽然与她有所不同，但一定会让她称心如意。这种结合对双方都有好处：女方活泼大方，可以把男方陶冶得心性柔和、举止优雅；男方精明强干、见多识广，定能使女方得到莫大的裨益。

只可惜这桩婚姻已成为镜花水月，使天下众多有情人失去了一个机会，一个了解什么是真正幸福的机会。她们家里很快将缔结一门性质不同的亲事，正是这门亲事的出现才毁掉了她的姻缘。

她无法想象，威克姆和莉迪亚怎样去维持这种闲散的生活。但她却不难想象得到，这种只顾情欲不顾道德的结合，根本得不到永久的幸福。

没过多久，加德纳先生又给姐夫写来一封信。他对贝内特先生那番感激的话只是简单地应酬了几句，诚恳地表示他愿为贝府所有的人竭诚效力，末了还请求贝先生不要再提这件事。他写这封信的主要目的是想告诉他们，威克姆已经决定脱离民兵团。这封信的后半段是这样写的：


我真心希望他把婚事一安排好，就立刻脱离民兵团，这样于他、于我的外甥女都大有益处。我想你一定会同意我的看法。威克姆打算加入正规军。他在那儿有些朋友，能够并且愿意帮他的忙。驻扎在北方的某将军麾下的一个团，已经答应收他当旗手。能够远离此地对他是有好处的，在那儿他可以为自己挣来锦绣前程。但愿换了环境之后，他们两人能在行为上有所检点。干事能谨慎些。我已经写信把我们最近的安排告诉了他，并请他代为通知威克姆在布赖顿一带的债主，就说威克姆的债务由我担保，一定迅速还清。随信附上一份名单，上面列的全是威克姆在麦里屯的债主。是否请你把还债的事情也告诉他们一声？威克姆把他所欠的债全都作了坦白，这份名单就是根据他提供的情况而列的。但愿他说的全是实话。我们已经对哈格斯顿作了交代，让他在一个星期之内把所有的事情都料理停当。你们如若不邀请他们夫妇回浪搏恩看看，他们将径直赶到部队去。听内人说，外甥女很想在离开南方前，和你们大家话别。她的身体很好，还请我代为问候你以及她的母亲。

你的

爱·加德纳



贝内特先生和女儿们都像加德纳先生一样看得清清楚楚，威克姆脱离民兵团具有方方面面的好处。可是贝内特太太听说后，心里却老大不情愿。她原指望女儿能回到哈福德郡居住，母女俩好朝夕相处，过一段快快活活的日子。如果莉迪亚定居北方，对她无疑是一种莫大的失望。再说，莉迪亚和民兵团的人都混得烂熟，又有那么多人喜欢她，要是远走他方，未免太可惜了。

于是，贝太太说道：“她和福斯特太太情同姐妹，把她就这么支走，也太让福斯特太太吃惊了！而且，民兵团还有一些年轻人，都很讨她的喜欢。某将军的那个团队里，未必会遇上如此温文尔雅的军官。”

莉迪亚请求在赴北方之前回家看望亲人，按说这也是在情理之中，谁料开头便被父亲断然拒绝了。幸好简和伊丽莎白顾忌到妹妹的情绪和现状，便好言好语地劝说父亲，指出妹妹的婚事应该得到父母的认可，在妹妹和威克姆举办了婚礼之后，应该欢迎他们到浪搏恩来。她们的话是那么合理，那么婉转，父亲终于给说得回心转意，答应照她们的看法办。母亲这下也满意了，想着趁这位出嫁了的女儿未到北方之前，向街坊邻居好好炫耀一下。接着，贝内特先生开始给内弟写信，表示同意那两口回家来，并且说定，要他们一举办完婚礼，即刻启程返回浪搏恩。在这件事上，伊丽莎白实在感到意外，没想到威克姆居然同意这样安排。单从她个人的愿望来讲，她说什么也不愿再见到威克姆。





第五十一章


妹妹结婚的那天，简和伊丽莎白都为她捏着一把汗，其担心的程度恐怕超过了她自己。家里派马车去迎接新婚夫妇，估计晚饭时分能赶回来。两位姐姐都害怕他们来家里，尤其简更是忧虑重重。她把自己放在莉迪亚的位子上想来想去，想象着如果自己是这场丑闻的主角，心里该会多么痛苦。一想到妹妹的艰难处境，她便觉得似乱箭穿心。

新婚夫妇来了。全家都集中在早餐厅里准备迎接。当马车停在大门前时，贝内特太太的脸上堆起了笑容。她的丈夫却板着脸，让人捉摸不透。女儿们慌作一团，显得非常焦急不安。

门厅里响起了莉迪亚的声音。接着，房门一下子被推开了，只见她飞跑了进来。母亲举步上前，欣喜若狂地拥抱她、欢迎她，一面又带着亲切的微笑，把手伸给跟在新娘后边的威克姆，向他们夫妇俩祝福。瞧她那副乐不可支的样子，她是毫不怀疑这是一门美满的婚姻。

小夫妻随即走到贝内特先生跟前，而贝先生对他们却不如太太那般热情。只见他脸色分外严峻，连嘴也不张一下。这对年轻夫妇那种安然自得、满不在乎的神气，让他憋了一肚子火。伊丽莎白觉得厌恶，就连简也感到惊愕。莉迪亚还是先前的老样子——桀骜不驯，没羞没臊，野里野气，叽叽喳喳，一副天不怕地不怕的样子。她从这个姐姐走到那个姐姐跟前，挨着个要她们向她道喜。待大家都坐下来之后，她用眼睛在屋里扫视了一周，注意到发生了一些变化，便带着朗朗的笑声说，她离开家里的时间真是太久了。

威克姆也和她一样，没有一点灰溜溜的痕迹。只见他拜会岳父岳母时微微含笑、谈吐自如，一举一动都是那样叫人着迷。要是他品行端正，和莉迪亚按规矩结婚，定会讨得大家的欢心。伊丽莎白以前算是低估了他，没想到他会如此厚颜无耻。可是当她坐下来之后，她便在心里暗暗思忖：一个人不要起脸来，简直可以什么都不顾。她为他感到脸红，简也红了脸。那一对宝贝虽然引得她们心慌意乱，而他们自己却面不改色。

此时此刻，不愁没有话说。新娘和她的母亲只怕有话来不及细谈。威克姆碰巧坐到了伊丽莎白身旁，向她打听起他在这一带一些熟人的情况。他的那种和颜悦色、从容不迫的劲儿，使她在回答时自叹弗如。小夫妇俩似乎都在心里留下了最美好的记忆。他们回顾起往事，一点也不觉得难过。莉迪亚厚着脸皮说个不停，所谈到的事情要是换上她的姐姐们，怎么也说不出口。

只听她大声嚷嚷道：“时间过得真快，我离开家都有一两个月了！依我说，好像只有两个星期。不过，在这段时间里还着实发生了不少事情呢。天啊！走的时候，我没想到自己会结了婚后再回来！可我当时倒是想过，如果真是结了婚，还是非常有意思的。”

父亲抬起了眼睛；简神情不安；伊丽莎白向莉迪亚使眼色。可是，莉迪亚对她不愿理会的事情，一向不闻不见，所以这时她仍然兴高采烈地朝下说着：“妈妈！这一带的人知道不知道我今天结婚？恐怕他们还不见得知道。在路上，我们的车追上威廉，古尔丁的马车。我有心让他知道我已结了婚，于是便把靠着他那边的玻璃侧窗放了下来，然后除去手套，将手搭在窗口，好让他看到我的结婚戒指。我还冲他点了点头，给了他一个微笑。”

伊丽莎白实在忍无可忍，只得站起身跑了出去。直至听到众人穿过走廊到餐厅去的脚步声，她才回到了家里人的身旁。只见莉迪亚寸步不离地走在母亲的右首，一边对大姐说道：“喂，简，我现在取代了你的位置。你的名次得朝下排排，因为我成了结了婚的女人！”

莉迪亚从一开始就没有觉得惭愧，现在也不会感到难为情，反而更加坦然，兴致越加高涨。她急切地想见见菲利普斯姨妈、卢卡斯一家以及所有其他的邻居，听他们称她为“威克姆太太”。吃过饭后，她跑去找希尔太太和家里的两个女用人，把手上的戒指显示给她们看，向她们弦耀自己已结了婚。

当家里人又重新聚集在早餐厅时，只听她说道：“妈妈，您觉得我丈夫怎么样？他很迷人，不是吗？我敢肯定，我的姐姐们都非常羡慕我。我这样的好运气，要让她们碰上一半就足够了。当时她们应该都到布赖顿去，那儿可是找女婿的好地方。真是太可惜啦，妈妈，我们真该全部开到那儿去！”

“一点不假。要是依着我，我们都应该去。不过，亲爱的莉迪亚，我真舍不得让你到那么远的地方去。难道非去不可吗？”

“噢，天哪！是非去不可。那又有什么呢？我会喜欢上那儿的。您和爸爸、姐姐可要来看望我们呀。我们将在纽卡斯尔越冬，肯定能参加各种舞会。我保证可以为姐姐们找到出色的舞伴。”

“那敢情再好不过啦！”母亲说。

“你们二老还家的时候，可以留下一个或两个姐姐。不是吹牛，在今年冬天之内我就能为她们找到如意郎君。”

“多谢你对我的关心，”伊丽莎白说，“只可惜我不喜欢你的那种寻找丈夫的方式。”

这一对年轻夫妇在家中逗留的时间不能超过十天。威克姆在离开伦敦前就接受了委任，必须在两个星期之内赶到团队报到。

不过，只有贝内特太太一人为他们感到惋惜，嫌他们待的时间太短。她抓紧一切时间，领着女儿走东家串西家，还三番五次在自家设宴待客。这种宴会大家都很喜欢：有心的人愿意借此机会向新人祝贺，而无心的人也想来凑凑热闹。

正如伊丽莎白所料，威克姆爱莉迪亚，并不像莉迪亚爱他爱得那么深。用不着多加观察，她只需分析一下各方面的因素便能看得出，他们两人私奔多半是因为莉迪亚爱恋威克姆所致，而不是由于威克姆倾心于莉迪亚，威克姆虽然并不十分爱莉迪亚，却偏偏要和她一道私奔，这在伊丽莎白看来也没有什么可奇怪的，因为她觉得他肯定是为债务所逼迫，不得不逃跑。假如真是如此，像他这样的青年，路上能有个女人陪伴，他当然不肯错过机会。

莉迪亚太爱他了，不分任何场合总要把她那亲爱的威克姆提来提去。在她的眼里，没有人能与他同日而语，他不管干什么事情都是天下第一。她坚信，到了九月一日那一天，他射杀的鸟一定比全国任何人都要多。

夫妇俩来后不久的一天早晨，莉迪亚在和两位姐姐闲坐时，对伊丽莎白这样说：

“丽茨，你还没听我讲讲我的婚礼盛况呢。我向妈妈以及其他人介绍的时候，你碰巧不在跟前。你难道就不想听听喜事是怎么操办的吗？”

“我倒真是不想听，”伊丽莎白答道，“我觉得这件事还是少谈为妙。”

“啧！你这个人真古怪！可我必须把经过情况讲给你听听。我们是在圣克利门教堂举行的婚礼，因为威克姆曾是那个教区的居民。我们约定好在十一点钟之前赶到那里。舅舅、舅妈随我一道去，在教堂跟其他人会合。嗬，星期一那天早晨，我简直紧张得要命！我生怕出现意外情况会拖延婚期，那样一来，我可要发疯的。当我梳妆打扮的时候，咱们的舅妈一个劲地说个不停，就像是在布教似的。不过，她说上十句话，我顶多能听进去一句，因为我一心惦记着亲爱的威克姆，这一点你是能够想象得来的。我当时很想知道，他会不会穿着他那件蓝衣服参加婚礼。

“和往常一样，我们那天是在十点钟吃的早饭。我只觉得，那顿饭像是永远也吃不完似的。说到这里，我得顺便告诉你一声，我在舅舅、舅妈家的那段时间，他们待我十分不友好。也许你不会相信，我在他们家住了两个星期，却没敢迈出他们的家门一步，没参加过一次宴会，也没有任何消遣，真能把人闷死！说实话，伦敦的确够冷清的了，不过小剧院[1]可是开着门的呀。还是言归正传吧。那天，迎娶的马车来接人的时候，舅舅却被人叫了去，和那个可恶的斯通先生洽谈业务。他们俩只要一碰到一起，话就说个没完。我简直担心极啦，不知如何是好。因为舅舅将送我出嫁，如果误了钟点，那天可就结不成婚了。幸好他去了不到十分钟，就又回来了。随后，大家便动身前往教堂。事后回想起来，他即便真给缠住了不能分身，婚礼也不用推迟，因为达西先生可以替代他的角色。”

“达西先生！”伊丽莎白万分惊愕，把这个名字又重复了一遍。

“哦，是呀！不瞒你说，他要陪着威克姆上教堂。天哪，我怎么全给忘啦！我不该把这件事说出来。我对他们发过誓言，答应不提此事！威克姆会怎样看待我呢？这可是个不该吐露的秘密呀！”

“既然是秘密，你就不用再说了，我绝不会追根问底。”简表白道。

“这是自然的，我们不会朝下问的。”伊丽莎白嘴上虽然这么说，但心里却十分好奇。

“谢谢你们，”莉迪亚说，“你们要是再问下去，我肯定会把事情全都讲出来。那样一来，威克姆会生气的。”

这话分明是在怂恿姐姐们朝下问。伊丽莎白只好抽身离开，这样便可以躲掉眼前的诱惑。

然而，要让她始终蒙在鼓里是不可能的，至少也得打听出一些情况来。想不到达西竟然参加了她妹妹的婚礼。那样的场面以及那样的一些人，显然全都是他所不想看到的。他肯定一点也不愿去凑那样的热闹。伊丽莎白胡猜乱想，脑子里出现了各种古怪的想法，可末了还是琢磨不出所以然来。她自然十分愿意把他往好处想，认为他具有高尚的动机，但是又觉得这不可能。这样的一个谜团叫她实在无法忍受，于是她不顾一切地抓过一页纸来，给舅母写了封短信，请她在不违背保密原则的基础上，对莉迪亚无意说漏的那句话做一些解释。

她在信里这样写道：“一个与咱们非亲非故，相对而言还比较生疏的人，为什么要在那样的关头和咱们站在一起呢？我的好奇之心，您是可以理解的。请您立即回信，说明其中的原委。不过，如果确实像莉迪亚说的那样，此事非保守秘密不可，那我就不再刨根问底了。”

写完信之后，她又自言自语地说：“亲爱的舅妈，倘若您不摆出些姿态来，把事情告诉给我，我迫不得已，只好不择手段自己去打听个明白了。”

简非常顾及情面，所以私下没有和伊丽莎白再议论起莉迪亚说漏的那句话。这一点很叫伊丽莎白高兴。她既然已写信询问这件事，在未接到回信之前，她不愿和任何人交换看法。

第五十二章


伊丽莎白果然如愿以偿，没过多久便收到了回信。她一拿上信，就连忙跑到了小树林里，寻了个没人打搅的地方，在一条长凳上坐下来，准备读个痛快。这封信写得很长，依此看来，舅妈没有拒绝她的请求。


亲爱的外甥女：

刚刚接到你的来信。我打算花一个上午的时间写回信。因为我预计三言两语无法将事情讲清楚。我必须承认，你的请求让我大吃一惊，因为我没料到你会提这样的问题。不要以为我在讲气话。我只是想说明，想不到你居然还需要写信来问我。如果你真的不明白是怎么回事，那就别怪我说话有冒犯之处了。我和你舅舅当时都感到非常惊奇，觉得那位先生之所以那样做，完全是为了你的缘故。你若是还不明白，那我就只好把话再说得清楚些了。

就在我离开浪搏恩，回家的那一天，一位意想不到的客人前来拜望你的舅舅。那人就是达西先生。他们俩关起门来，密谈了好几个小时。待我回到家时，他们的谈话已经结束了。当时，我可不像你这么好奇心十足。他来这儿是想告诉加德纳先生，他已经查出了你妹妹以及威克姆的下落，并和他们分别谈过话——跟威克姆谈过许多次，跟莉迪亚谈过一次。依我看，他只比咱们迟一天离开德比郡，怀着极大的决心来到城里寻找他们。他说这件事的发生，全怪他不好，没有及早揭露威克姆卑鄙的品行，否则绝不会有哪位正派姑娘倾心于他、听信他的甜言蜜语。他引咎自责，把所有的过错都揽在自己身上，认为当初都怪他过于高傲，不屑于让威克姆丑恶的行径大白于天下，总觉得他的真面目迟早会自我暴露。因此，他认为自己有责任出面调停，补救由他引起的不幸。倘若他还有别的目的，我也觉得不会有损于他的形象。他在城里待了几天，才算找到了他们。不过，他倒是有些线索，不像咱们那样瞎碰乱撞。就是因为他自信有些门路，才尾随咱们出来找人。

事情好像是这样的。有个扬格太太，以前当过达西小姐的家庭教师，后来因为做错了事情而被解雇了。具体做错了什么事情，他没有说明。扬格太太在爱德华大街搞到一幢大房子，靠招房客维持生活。达西先生知道她和威克姆关系密切，于是一进城便寻到她家，请她提供威克姆的情况。足足花了两三天的时间，他才从她的口里套出了真情。扬格太太知道她那位朋友的去处，可是如果不出钱贿赂她，她是绝不肯讲出来的。原来，威克姆一抵达伦敦，就去找过她。要是她挽留他们，他们一定会住在她家。最后，我们的那位好心的朋友终于问清了他们的确切地址，发现他们住在某条大街上。他先见到了威克姆，然后非要见莉迪亚不可。他说，他最初的目的是劝说莉迪亚摆脱眼前不光彩的处境，一经和家里说通，就尽快返回家中。他答应尽自己的力量帮她的忙。谁知莉迪亚死心塌地要与威克姆共患难。家里的人她一个都不放在心上，同时也不需要他达西的帮助，死也不肯离开威克姆。她坚信他们俩总有一天会结为夫妻，迟一些时候早一些时候关系并不大。达西第一次和威克姆谈话就发现，威克姆根本不打算与莉迪亚结婚，而现在他见莉迪亚仍不肯放弃威克姆，于是便觉得唯一可行的办法是尽快促成这桩婚姻。威克姆亲口供认，他离开民兵团，完全是因为赌债所迫，并且厚颜无耻地声明，由于莉迪亚过于愚蠢才给她自己造成了恶劣的后果。他打算马上辞职，至于以后干什么，他心里一点儿谱也没有。他必须到别的地方去，可又不知去哪里最为合适。他清楚自己已濒临绝境，快没有钱维持生活了。达西先生问他为何没有立即同你的妹妹结婚。他指明，贝内特先生虽然不十分富有，但绝不会袖手旁观，所以，威克姆结了婚，自然会得到好处。可是他发现威克姆回答这话时，仍指望着到别的地方攀一门亲事，趁机发一笔横财。威克姆虽然是这样说的，但如果能抓住根救急的稻草，他也未必不会无动于衷。

他们俩又见了好几次面，因为有许多事情需要进一步商谈。威克姆先是漫天要价，但后来出于无奈，只好理智了些，减少了钱数。

就这样，他们把一切都谈妥了。达西先生的下一个步骤就是把这件事告诉你舅舅。于是在我回家的头一天晚上，他跑到格雷斯丘奇街来了。那是他的第一次造访，只可惜加德纳先生碰巧不在家。他再一打听，发现你父亲还在这里，不过第二天早晨就要走。他认为你父亲不像你舅舅那么好说话，于是决定等他走后再来找你舅舅。当时他没有留下姓名，家里只知道有位绅士来过，说是有事。

星期六，他又来到了我们家。这时你父亲已离开，而你的舅舅却候在家中。就像我刚才所说的那样，他们两人进行了一番长谈。

星期日那天，他们再次交谈，当时我也见到了他。事情直到星期一才完全谈妥，随即马上派专差送信到浪搏恩。我们的那位客人真是太固执了。丽茨，我觉得固执才是他性格上真正的短处。人们对他说三道四，今天说他这不对，明天又指责他那不好，但说来说去，唯有固执才实实在在是他的缺点。我敢肯定，你舅舅十分愿意把事情都揽在自己身上（我这样说并不是想博得你们的感激，所以不要对别人再提起），可是达西先生凡事都执意要亲自操办。

他们为这事争了很长时间，其实他们根本不值得为那一对当事的男女这般呕心沥血。最后还是你舅舅被迫作出了让步，非但不能够为自己的外甥女稍尽绵薄，还要无劳居功，这实在违背了他的心意。我相信，你今天早晨的来信一定叫他感到十分高兴，因为这样一来他便可以把这件掠人之美的事情解释个明白，使应该受到赞美的人受到赞美。不过，丽茨，此事不宜向外张扬，顶多只能告诉简一人。

我想，你一定明白他为那对年轻人出了多大的力。光他替威克姆还债的钱就远远超过了一千镑，另外，除了莉迪亚名下的钱，又给了她一千镑。这还不够，他又为威克姆捐了个官职。至于他为什么要一个人支付这许多钱，我在前边已解释了原因。他总觉得都怪他不声不响、考虑欠妥，才致使人们没有认清他的品行，结果上了当，把他当成了好人。这话听起来也许有几分道理，可我却认为，莉迪亚的私奔既不能怪他不声不响，也不能怪任何其他人守口如瓶。亲爱的丽茨，你应该相信，尽管他把话说得娓娓动听，但要不是考虑到他这样做还有别的用意，你舅舅才不会让步呢。

一切细节商定之后，他又回到了彭伯里应酬他的那些朋友。走时他说好，举行婚礼时他还要来伦敦，办理钱财方面的最后手续。

现在我把事情的原委全告诉了你。正应了你的话，这件事的披露会让你大吃一惊。我希望你至少不要因此而感到不悦。莉迪亚来我们家住过，威克姆也常来走动。他还是我在哈福德郡见到他时的那副老样子。莉迪亚住在我们家的这段时间，其行为实在叫人难以满意。我本来不打算告诉你，可我在星期三接到了简的一封信，方知她回家之后故态复萌，于是便觉得就是讲出来也不会给你增加新的痛苦。我极其严肃地找她谈过几次话，向她指出她的所作所为是十分错误的，害得一家人都为之愁眉不展。她要是听进去了我的话，那才怪呢。我觉得，她对我的忠告充耳不闻。有时我真气得发疯，但一想到亲爱的伊丽莎白和简，我就冷静了下来。看在你们的分上，我一直容忍着她。

达西准时回来了，并且像莉迪亚对你们所说的那样，参加了婚礼。第二天，他跟我们一起吃了饭，打算在星期三或者星期四离城。亲爱的丽茨，如果我在这里说一声我打心眼里喜欢他（以前我一直没敢这么说过），你会生我的气吗？他对待我们和颜悦色，跟咱们在德比郡那时一模一样。他的见识和观点叫我心服口服。要是再活泼一点，他真算得上是个十全十美的人了。不过只要谨慎一些，娶个好太太，就连这点缺陷也会得到克服。我觉得他非常含蓄，因为他几乎从不提你的名字。不过，含蓄似乎是一种时髦。

如果我把话说得过了头，还得多请你原谅，不要对我惩罚得太严厉，将来连彭伯里也不让我去。有朝一日，我要把那座庄园游个遍才会心满意足。我只求能乘上一辆矮矮的四轮轻便马车，驾上一对漂亮的小马四处兜兜风。

我必须就此搁笔了，因为孩子们嚷着要我去已有半个钟点了。

你的舅妈

M.加德纳

九月六日写于格雷斯丘奇街



伊丽莎白读完信后，顿时心潮澎湃。她心里说不清是什么滋味，不知是喜悦大于痛楚，还是痛楚大于喜悦。她以前也曾产生过一种朦胧的感觉，想到过达西可能做了些工作，促成了妹妹的婚事。但她又不敢朝这方面多想，怕他的心肠不至于好到这种程度。同时她又顾虑到，万一这种猜想成为现实，那就落下了天大的人情，今生今世也难以补报。现在，她的那些揣测都得到了证实！达西随他们之后，竟然特意来到了城里，并且不辞劳苦、不顾身份地寻求解决问题的方法。他不惜一切地向一个自己所憎恶和鄙视的女人求情，同时还得低三下四地去会见，而且是屡次会见一个他唯恐躲避不及，甚至连名字都不愿提起的男人。他和那个男人讲道理，苦口婆心地劝说对方，最后还采用了贿赂的手段。他这般仁至义尽，完全是为了一个他既不钟情又不仰慕的姑娘。她在心里悄悄对自己说，他所做的一切都是为了她。可是一想到别的方面，她立刻又打消了这个念头。她认为，自己就是虚荣心再强，也不能指望他去爱一个曾经让他碰过钉子的女人。更何况他讨厌与威克姆沾亲带故，这种情绪是极其自然的，哪能指望他俯尊迁就！做威克姆的姐夫，这可是莫大的耻辱！凡是有点自尊心的人，绝不会愿意攀这样的亲事。毋庸置疑，他的确出了不少力。她简直不好意思去想象他究竟做了多少工作。然而，他已经说明了原因，说明了他为什么要插手这件事，关于这一点不用多解释便能让人信服。他说他在将功补过，这是情通理顺的。他为人慷慨，同时也有条件仗义疏财。她虽然不肯承认他的所作所为主要是为了她，但她也许可以相信，他对她依然旧情难忘，因此遇到这样一件与她心境攸关的事情，他会觉得责无旁贷，应该尽自己的一份力量。一想到他对她们家恩重如山，而这种恩情永远得不到报答，她便觉得痛苦不堪，心里异常难过。多亏了他的鼎力相助，莉迪亚才回到了家中，保全了名节。回首往事，她对他是那样行为不恭、出言不逊，这怎能不让她由衷地感到伤心。她为自己感到耻辱，却为他感到自豪。他出于怜悯之心和一腔义气，不顾自己满腹的委屈，帮助了她的亲人。她把舅妈对他的那段颂扬之词读了一遍又一遍，只觉得夸奖得还不够，不过心里倒是感到美滋滋的。舅舅和舅妈都断定她和达西先生情真意挚、肝胆相照，这叫她产生了几分喜悦，喜悦之中还掺杂着懊悔。

这时，有人走了过来，打断了她的遐思。于是她一跃从座位上站起来，正要拐进另一条小径，却见威克姆赶了上来。

“恐陷我干扰了你的宁静吧。亲爱的姐姐？”威克姆说着话，已经走到了她跟前。

“的确如此，”她笑着回答道，“不过，这样的干扰未必就不受欢迎。”

“要是不受欢迎，那就太遗憾了。咱们一直是好朋友，现在关系又进了一步。”

“这倒不假。其他人也出来散步吗？”

“不知道。贝内特太太和莉迪亚打算乘马车到麦里屯去。亲爱的姐姐，我听舅舅和舅妈说，你们到彭伯里去过。”伊丽莎白回答说他们是到那儿去过。

“你们真是幸运，实在让人羡慕，只可惜我没有那种福分。要不然，我到纽卡斯尔去的途中，完全可以顺道去那儿瞧瞧。你们大概见到那位老管家了吧？可怜的雷诺兹，她总是那么喜欢我。喜欢倒是喜欢，但她肯定没在你们面前提过我的名字。”

“她提到你了。”

“她提怎么说的？”

“说你参了军后，情况恐怕……恐怕不太妙。你知道，路隔得那么远，有些话传到那里就走样了。”

“那当然。”威克姆咬了咬嘴唇说道。

伊丽莎白以为这一下算堵住了他的嘴，谁知没过多大工夫又听他说道：

“上个月我在城里看到了达西，真是感到意外。我们遇到过好几次呢。不知他到那儿有何贵干？”

“也许是筹备他和布德尔小姐的婚事吧，”伊丽莎白说，“反正在这样的季节进城，准有要紧的事操办。”

“毫无疑问。你们在兰顿时，看到过他吗？我好像听加德纳夫妇说，你们见过面。”

“是的。他还把我们介绍给了他妹妹呢。”

“你喜欢她吗？”

“非常喜欢。”

“听说这一两年，她大有长进。我最后一次见到她时，她还不太有出息呢。我很高兴你喜欢她。但愿她能成为一名出色的姑娘。”

“她肯定会的。现在她已经过了最脆弱的年龄。”

“你们路过金普顿村了没有？”

“我记得好像没有。”

“我提到那个村庄，是因为我本来可以在那里得到牧师的俸禄。那真是一个令人心醉神迷的地方！牧师住宅简直漂亮极啦！各方面都挺合我的口味。”

“你能喜欢传经布教吗？”

“喜欢极啦。我会把布教视为自己的神圣职责。开头肯定会费点气力，但很快就会无所谓的。世上是没有卖后悔药的，可是我的确太想得到那份美差了！那种清闲安逸的生活，完全符合我的幸福观！可惜我的愿望落空了。你在肯特逗留期间，听达西讲过这件事没有？”

“听他讲过，而且我认为他的话很可靠。据说那个职位给你是有条件的，由现在的庄园主随意处理。”

“这些你全听说啦！不错，这话说得有几分道理。如果你还记得起，我一开始就对你这么说过。”

“我还听说，过去有段时期你并非像现在这般热衷于布教。你曾经宣布过永远也不当牧师，于是这件事便以折中的方法了结了。”

“你真听说啦！这话倒不是完全没有根据。你也许还记得，咱们第一次谈起此事时，我就给你讲过这一点。”

此刻他们俩已快走到家门口了，因为伊丽莎白想尽快摆脱他，所以步子迈得很大。看在妹妹的分上，她又不愿得罪他，因此只是和颜悦色地笑了笑说：

“算啦，威克姆先生，现在咱们是姐弟了，不必为过去的事情争吵了。但愿以后咱们能同心同德。”

她说着伸出了手来。威克姆亲切而殷勤地吻了一下，不过神情有些尴尬。随后，他们走进了家中。





第五十三章


在这次谈话之后，威克姆算是彻底安心了。他再也不会接触这个话题了，免得自寻烦恼，也免得招惹他那亲爱的二姐伊丽莎白。伊丽莎白见自己的话生了效，封住了他的口，心里感到十分高兴。

转眼间，威克姆和莉迪亚的行期来到了，贝内特太太无可奈何，只得与他们依依惜别。这一别，恐怕要隔个一年半载才能见面，因为丈夫坚绝不同意她的主张，不同意让全家人都到纽卡斯尔去。

“噢！我的宝贝莉迪亚，”她大声喊道，“咱们母女俩何时才能重逢呵？”

“天哪！我也不知道。也许两三年都见不着面。”

“常给我写信，亲爱的。”

“我尽量常写。不过您也知道，一个女人结了婚，就没有多少时间写家信了。姐姐们倒是可以常写信给我，反正她们无事可做。”

威克姆在辞行的时候，显得比妻子亲昵得多。他笑容满面、风度翩翩，说了一大堆动听的话。

“他是我见到的最出众的一个人，”一对小夫妻刚一出了家门，贝内特先生就说道，“他既会假笑，又会傻笑，还善于和咱们大家亲热。我为他感到无比自豪。我敢说，就连威廉·卢卡斯爵士也未必能拿得出更宝贝的女婿。”

和女儿分手之后，贝内特太太郁闷了好多天。

“我常常在想，最大的痛苦莫过于和亲友的生离死别。一个人要是没有亲友相伴，显得是如此孤寂悲凉。”她说道。

伊丽莎白说：“妈妈，现在您也知道了，这就是把女儿嫁出去的结果。好在您还有四个未婚的女儿，想起来会让您心里好受些。”

“不是那么回事。莉迪亚离我而去，倒不是因为结了婚的缘故，而是因为她丈夫的团队碰巧驻扎得很远。要是离得近一些，她就不会走得这么匆忙了。”

这件事把贝内特太太弄得心情沮丧，可是过不了多久，这种无精打采的现象便消失了。外边开始流传起一条消息，又一次在她的心中激发了希望。据说，尼瑟费德的女管家已经接到了命令，要她准备迎接主人的归来。她的主人这一两天就可抵达，计划在乡下狩几个星期的猎。贝内特太太听后一下子坐立不安起来，常常拿眼睛瞧简，脸上挂着微笑，并不时摇着头。

“好么，好么，宾利先生总算要回来啦，妹妹，”（因为第一个告诉她这消息的正是菲利普斯太太。）“其实，他能回来也好。不过我才不管他回来不回来呢。你知道，他和我们没有任何关系，我再也不愿见到他了。然而，他既然想回来，我们唯有表示欢迎。谁知道会发生什么样的情况。不过这与我们无关。你知道，妹妹，我们早就讲好了，再也不提那件事。如此说来，他肯定要来？”

“千真万确，”菲利普斯太太回答说，“尼科利斯太太[1]昨晚去过麦里屯。我看见她从门前走过，便急忙跑出去探听虚实。结果她向我证实了外边的传言，说宾利先生可能在星期三回来，最迟也不超过星期四。她说她正要到肉铺定点肉。准备星期三做菜用，还说她已经备下了六只鸭子，随时都可以宰杀。”

贝内特小姐听说宾利要回来，脸上不由变了颜色。她已经有好几个月没在伊丽莎白面前提到过他的名字了。但这次姐妹俩单独在一起的时候，便听她说道：

“丽茨，今天姨妈讲述那件事时，我看见你用眼直瞧我。我知道我那时的脸色不大对劲，但你千万不要以为我动了什么愚蠢的念头。那一刻，我只是有点心慌意乱，总觉得大家都在盯着我。老实讲，他要回来的消息既没有给我带来喜悦，也没有使我感到痛苦。我唯一感到满意的是，这次他是一个人回来，这样便可以少见他的面。至于我自己，倒没有什么可担心的，怕只怕别人生出闲话来。”

伊丽莎白对这件事也有些摸不着头脑。要是在德比郡没见到宾利，她或许真会以为他来乡下只是像人们所说的那样为了狩猎。她仍然觉得他还爱恋着简。至于他这次来乡下是得到了他的那位朋友的恩准，还是大着胆子擅自跑来的，这实在叫她无从断定。

她有时不由这么想：“他真是个可怜虫，回到自己租赁的庄园还要引起人们纷纷的猜测，想想让人感到难过。所以最好不要对他的事情纠缠住不放。”

不管姐姐嘴上是怎么说的，心里是怎么想的，伊丽莎白一眼便能看得出，宾利要来的消息已经影响了她的情绪，使她比平常更加心神不宁、烦躁不安。

大约在一年之前，她们的父母曾经为宾利的出现激烈争论过，而现在这个话题又被扯了出来。

“亲爱的，”贝内特太太说道，“宾利先生一来，你可一定要去拜访他呵。”

“不去。去年你硬逼着我去登他家的门，说我只要去了，他就会娶咱们的一个女儿做太太，可你的美梦最后还不是落了个空。我再也不会接受一个笨蛋的指派了。”

他太太向他指出，宾利回到尼瑟费德后，当地的绅士们少不了得去问候一声。

“我讨厌这样的礼节，”他说，“如果他真想和咱们交往，那就让他主动来找咱们，他不是不知道咱家的门朝哪边开。我才不愿跟在邻居的屁股后边打转转，把时间浪费在迎来送往上呢。”

“别的我不管，只知道如果你不去拜访他，未免过于失礼。反正我已经打定了主意，说什么也得请他来吃顿饭。必须马上给朗太太和古尔丁一家送去请帖。加上咱们家的人总共是十三个，正好可以为他留个席位。”

她把主意打定之后，心里感到宽慰了些。任凭丈夫怎样无礼，都能够忍受了。不过令人烦恼的是，这样一来，邻居们很可能会先他们一步见到宾利。

就在宾利快要回来的那一天，简对妹妹说道：“我觉得他若是不回来就好啦。不过这也无所谓。就是见到他，我也不会在乎，只是不愿听家里人没完没了地谈论这件事。妈妈是一片好心，可她不知道——没有一个人知道——她的那些话让我听了有多难受。但愿他不要在尼瑟费德住下去，那时我会为之额手称庆！”

伊丽莎白回答道：“我真想说几句安慰的话，可是一句也说不出来。你一定明白我的意思。我不能像一般人那样，见你心里难过，就劝你要有耐心，因为你一向都是挺有耐心的。”

宾利先生终于来了。贝内特太太靠用人打探消息，最早听到这风声，因而操心劳神的时间也就最长。她掐着手指数天天，盘算着何时请他来吃饭，同时为不能早一点见到他而感到失魂落魄。不料就在他来到哈福德郡的第三天早晨，她就从梳妆室的窗口看见他骑着马走进围场，朝她家里过来了。

她急忙招呼女儿们来和她共同分享喜悦。简坐在桌前一动未动，而伊丽莎白不愿扫母亲的兴，便走到了窗旁。她放眼一瞧，只见达西也跟着一块来了，于是又坐回到姐姐身旁。

“妈妈，还有一位先生和他在一起，”吉蒂说，“那会是谁呢？”

“大概是他的朋友吧，宝贝。我的确不知道。”

“对啦！”吉蒂又说道，“看来就是那个以前老和他在一起的人……叫什么名字来着……就是那个身材高高的、傲气十足的人呗。”

“天哪！是达西先生！……是他，我敢肯定是他。好啦，凡是宾利先生的朋友，我们总是欢迎的。要不然，我讨厌见到他。”

简吃惊而关切地望了望伊丽莎白。她不知道他们两人曾在德比郡有过接触，因此觉得妹妹自从收到他那封解释的信以后，这回差不多是第一次跟他见面，一定会感到十分窘迫。姐妹俩都觉得非常不自在。她们各有各的隐衷，都很体谅对方。母亲还在一旁唠叨个不停，说她一点也不喜欢达西，只是念着他是宾利的朋友，才决定对他以礼相待。她的这些话，两个大女儿一个字也没听进去。其实，伊丽莎白之所以忐忑不安，有些根由是简所意想不到的。伊丽莎白始终缺乏勇气把加德纳太太的那封信拿给简看，也没有胆量说自己已改变了对达西的看法。简只知道她拒绝过他的求婚，并且把他的人品说得一无是处。殊不知伊丽莎白了解到了事情的全部底细，了解到他是她们家的大恩人，因而她对他的情感即使不如简对宾利那般深切，起码也同样入情入理、恰到好处。这次达西回到尼瑟费德，又主动来浪搏恩找她，实在让她万分惊愕，几乎像她上次在德比郡发现他改变态度时一样惊愕。

一想到他始终不渝地爱恋她，抱着坚定不移的决心，她那苍白的脸上刹那间出现了血色，甚至放射出红光。只见她笑逐颜开，双目熠熠闪亮。不过，她还得把他的来意再证实一下。

她心想：“让我先看看他的态度如何，然后再抱期望也不迟。”

她坐在那里专心做针线，尽力装出一副无动于衷的样子，连眼皮也不抬一下，直待用人走近门口时，才按捺不住地望了望姐姐的脸。简看上去比平时略显苍白，但却稳重沉静！实出她的意外。两位先生出现在面前时，简的脸上泛起了红晕，但她对他们的态度却从容不迫，其举止恰如其分，既没有流露出丝毫的怨恨，又无半点媚骨。

伊丽莎白跟那两人仅仅寒暄了几句，便又坐下来做针线活，那种认真的劲儿是平时少见的。她大着胆子向达西瞟了一眼，只见他比往日严肃了几分，完全换上了以前在哈福德郡时的那副神情，而她在德比郡看到的那种温和劲儿已荡然无存。这或许是因为他当着她母亲的面过于拘泥，不似在她舅舅和舅妈跟前那样自在。这种设想让人感到难过，但绝不是不可能的。

她也望了宾利一眼，看到他显得既高兴，同时又忸怩不安，贝内特太太对待宾利热情友好，而对他的朋友却勉强敷衍、态度冷漠，这种强烈的对比让她的两个大女儿为之感到羞愧。

多亏了达西从中斡旋，贝内特太太最心爱的小女儿才没有落个身败名裂的下场。这一点唯有伊丽莎白清楚，所以她见母亲不明是非地厚此薄彼，心里感到特别难过和沮丧。

达西向伊丽莎白问起加德纳夫妇的情况，伊丽莎白回答时有些慌张。问完这几句之后，他几乎没再说什么。他之所以沉默寡语，大概是没有坐在她身旁的缘故吧？不过，在德比郡时情况却并非如此。记得他无法与她攀谈时，就和她的舅父舅妈搭话。而现在几分钟过去，也不见他吱一声。有时她实在按捺不住好奇心，就抬起眼睛去瞧他的面孔，结果不是见他在望简就是在盯着她看，要不干脆对着地面发呆。显而易见，比起上一次见到他的时候，他的心思加重了，不似从前那样急于讨好她了。伊丽莎白感到大失所望，可转而又怪自己不该失望。

“难道我还能有别的奢望吗！”她心里嘀咕道，“不过他为什么要到这里来呢？”

除了他以外，她没有兴致跟别人讲话，可她又没有勇气找他攀谈。

她问候了他的妹妹，随后便又没词了。

这时只听贝内特太太说：“宾利先生，你离开这儿的时间可不短了。”

宾利连连称是，承认的确如此。

“开头我还怕你一去不复返了呢。听人说，你打算在米迦勒节那天退掉那幢房子。我希望这只是误传。自打你走之后，这一带发生了翻天覆地的变化。卢卡斯小姐已结了婚，寻到了归宿。我自己也有一个女儿嫁了人。我想你已经听说了。你一定是在报上看到这消息的，就登在《泰晤士报》和《信使晚报》上。文稿写得很不像样。只是简单地提到：‘乔治·威克姆先生最近和莉迪亚·贝内特小姐喜结良缘。’上面没有提细节，只字不谈莉迪亚的父亲，也没有说她住在哪里。那是我弟弟加德纳拟的稿，真不知他怎么会那么草率。你看到了没有？”

宾利说他看到过那则消息，并向她道了喜。伊丽莎白不敢抬起眼皮，因而也不知道达西的表情如何。

“嫁女儿自然是件叫人高兴的事，”她母亲继续说道，“不过，我又实在老大不忍和她分手，宾利先生。他们去了纽卡斯尔，那是在北边很远的地方，不知何年何月才能回来。他的团队驻扎在那鬼地方……我想你大概已听说过他脱离了民兵团，加入正规军了吧？谢天谢地！他总算有几个朋友帮忙，虽然他的朋友没有他应该得到的那样多。”

伊丽莎白知道这话是影射达西的，于是感到羞愧难当，简直有点坐不住了。不过，这番话也产生了另一个效果，居然引得她说了话。只听她问宾利是否打算在乡下住一段时间。宾利回答说要住几个星期。

“宾利先生，等你把你们那儿的鸟都打光之后，”她母亲在一旁又插了话，“就请你到贝内特先生的庄园来，爱打多少你就打多少。我相信贝内特先生一定非常乐意让你来，还会把最好的鹧鸪都留给你。”

伊丽莎白见母亲多此一举地乱献殷勤，心里越加痛苦。回想起一年之前，姐妹俩曾经想入非非，对未来充满憧憬，谁知转眼之间美梦落空，如今好事在即，但难免重蹈覆辙，又让人徒自悲伤。此刻的伊丽莎白感慨万分，觉得她和简即便能获得终身幸福，也弥补不了她们眼下心里的苦闷和困惑。

她不由暗自思忖：“我的最大心愿是和这两个人彻底断绝来往。和他们在一起，痛苦往往大于欢乐！但愿今生今世也不要再看到他们！”

虽然说起来，姐妹俩的终身幸福也弥补不了眼下的痛苦，可是伊丽莎白立刻便发现姐姐的美貌又一次点燃了她以前那位恋人的爱情之火，于是她心里的痛苦便大大减轻了。宾利刚进门的时候，跟简没说上几句话。但没过几分钟，他就逐渐对她关注了起来。他发现她和去年一样美丽动人，一样温文尔雅及落落大方，只是不比去年那般爱说话。简一心只希望人家看不出她跟从前有什么两样，还真的自以为和从前一样健谈呢。其实她心事太重，有时沉默下来，连她自己也觉察不到。

当两位客人起身告辞时，贝内特太太记起了自己拟定好的计划，于是便邀请他们过几日来浪搏恩赴宴。

“你还欠我一次回访呢，宾利先生，”她又说道，“去年冬天你进城时曾许过诺，答应一回来就来我们家吃饭。你瞧，我可一直没忘记呵。不瞒你说，你没有回来赴约，真叫我大失所望。”

听到这话，宾利先是有点发愣，接着便胡乱支吾了几句，说他有事耽搁了，实在抱歉。随后，他们俩离开了贝家。

贝内特太太原来十分想当天就把他们留下来吃饭，可是又想到，即便她家里的饭菜历来都是相当不错的，但要是招待一个她一心想高攀的先生，要想满足那位年进项为一万镑的贵人，既叫他吃得可口又不伤他的面子，至少得添两道正菜才行。

[1]尼瑟费德庄园的女管家。





第五十四章


客人刚走，伊丽莎白便到屋外去溜达，想松弛一下神经，或者换句话说，是想找个没人的地方好好考虑一下问题。这些问题压得她难以透过气来。达西的行为既让她感到吃惊，又叫她异常烦恼。

她自言自语地说：“他既然能上这里来，为什么非得板着面孔、沉默寡言、冷冷淡淡呢？”

她想来想去，总是得不出个叫人愉快的结论。

“他在城里时，对我的舅舅和舅妈倒是挺和气，挺招人喜欢，可是见了我为什么要横眉冷对呢？如果他是讨厌我，那又何必到这儿来呢？若是不再有心于我，为什么不痛痛快快说个清楚呢？他可真会捉弄人！没必要再在这样的人身上费心思。”

恰在此刻，姐姐走了过来，使她暂时忘掉了自己的烦恼。一瞧简那副乐不可支的神情，便能看得出她对家里来的两位客人是比较满意的。

只听她说：“现在，第一次见面已经结束了，我心里没有一点慌张的感觉。我了解自己的承受力，下次他再来，我绝不会感到难为情了。令我感到高兴的是，他在星期二要来吃饭。到时候大家便能看得出，我和他只是关系很平淡的一般性的熟人。”

“是呀，关系的确很平淡，”伊丽莎白嘻嘻哈哈地说，“简啊简，你可要注意呀。”

“亲爱的丽茨，你可千万别以为我是个意志薄弱的人，现在还执迷不悟。”

“我觉得你执迷不悟得厉害，一定会让他爱你爱得发狂。”

在星期二之前，她们再也没见到过宾利和达西。宾利在上次半个小时的短暂访问中，显得兴致勃勃，礼貌周全，这一来，贝内特太太又恢复了希望，打起了她的如意算盘。

到了星期二那一天，浪搏恩府上宾客如云。主人家翘首盼望的那两位先生准时赶到，不愧是严守时间的狩猎家。他们步入餐厅时，伊丽莎白双目炯炯地注视着宾利，看他会不会挨着姐姐坐下，因为在以前的宴会上他总是取那个席位。她那位精明的母亲也在转同样的念头，因此没有请他坐在自己身边。宾利刚一进屋的时候，似乎有些迟疑，但这时简恰好转过了身子，恰好脸上挂着微笑。他这才坚定了决心，挨着她坐了下来。

伊丽莎白感到很是得意，于是不由把目光投向他的朋友。只见达西态度坦然，摆出一副若无其事的样子。要不是瞧见宾利又惊又喜地也望了达西一眼，她还以为他一定是事先得到了达西的恩准，才把座位选在简的身旁呢。

宴席间，宾利对简流露出了爱慕之情。虽然与先前相比，他这次表现得比较隐晦，但他的一言一行都使伊丽莎白觉得，如若他能够完全主宰自己的命运，他和简的幸福便指日可待。虽然她不敢有过分的奢望，可是看到他对姐姐那样殷勤，心里不由感到十分欢愉。她原本闷闷不乐，而现在精神上受到了极大的鼓舞。达西坐在母亲的旁边，与她相隔甚远。她觉得这种局面无论对达西还是对她母亲，都非常不方便，只能为他们双方增加痛苦。由于离得远，她听不清他们都说了些什么，不过却能看得到他们彼此很少搭话，就是偶尔谈几句，也显得十分拘谨、十分冷淡。眼见着母亲那样缺乏礼貌，再想想他对她们家有着那样深厚的恩泽，伊丽莎白心里觉得格外难过。有时她恨不得向他讲明，在她们家里并非所有的人都不晓得他对她们家的帮助，也并非所有的人都是忘恩负义的小人。

她一心希望今天晚上能有机会和他接近，跟他深谈一下，而不是仅仅局限于他刚进门时和他寒暄的那几句，免得辜负了他来访的好意。吃完饭后，她在客厅里等待达西和宾利出现时，心情焦急不安，觉得屋子里的气氛异常沉闷，闷得她直想发脾气。她盼望着他们尽快走进来，就好像今晚能否过得愉快全在此一举了。

她心想：“如果到时候他不来找我说话，那我就再也不打他的主意啦。”

男士们走了进来。她觉得达西似乎很有可能满足她的心愿。可是天哪！女士们挤得紧紧地围坐在桌子旁，使得她旁边连放把椅子的空当都没有了。她和简光顾着为大家斟咖啡及沏茶，没注意到这些。当男士们一步步迫近时，一位姑娘又朝她身边靠了靠，悄声说道：

“不能让男人们到这儿来，把咱们分开。不管哪个男的来都不行，你说是吧？”

达西到屋子的另一边去了。伊丽莎白用目光跟随着他，妒忌每一个和他说话的人。她简直没有心思再为客人们斟咖啡了。接着又生起了自己的气，怪自己不该这般愚蠢！

“这个男人已经被我拒绝过一次！我怎么傻到了这种地步，居然指望他对我重新燃起爱情的火焰？哪个男人会如此没有骨气，竟向同一位女人第二次求婚？哪个女人也没像我那样亵渎过他的感情！”

这时达西亲自把咖啡杯送了回来，才算给了她一线希望。于是她不失时机地说：“你妹妹还在彭伯里吗？”

“是的。她要在那儿住到圣诞节。”

“就她一个人吗？她的朋友都走啦？”

“安妮斯利太太陪着她。其他人都在三个星期以前去了斯卡伯勒[1]。”

她肚子里没了词，想不出再说些什么。不过，如果达西愿意跟她交谈，也许能扯出个话题来。可惜达西呆呆地站在她身旁，一声也不吭。后来他见旁边的小姐和伊丽莎白说悄悄话，便知趣地走开了。

待茶具撤走，摆了牌桌时，太太小姐们都站起了身。伊丽莎白以为这一下达西很快就会来找她，可是她的希望落了空。只见她的母亲在生拉硬拽地请客人们和她打牌，连达西也难逃过她的纠缠，跟其他人一起在牌桌旁坐了下来。伊丽莎白顿时万念俱灰，丧失了所有的兴致。今晚她算没有一点指望了。他们俩分别坐在自己的牌桌旁穷以应付，分不出身来。达西时不时向她这儿瞟上一眼，结果两个人都心不在焉，白白输了牌。

贝内特太太原打算把尼瑟费德的这两位先生留下来再吃顿晚饭，但倒霉的是，他们的马车比其他的客人先备好，使她没有机会表明心迹。

等客人们走光之后，她说道：“喂，姑娘们，你们觉得今天过得怎么样？依我说，今天万事如意，一切都是那么顺顺当当。饭菜做得香喷喷，比哪一家的都可口。鹿肉烧得恰到好处，大家都说，从没见过那么肥嫩的腰肉。要是论汤，比上星期咱们在卢卡斯家喝的强五十倍。连达西先生也承认，那鹧鸪肉烧得简直妙极啦。我想，他们家至少雇着两三个厨师呢。我的宝贝简，我从来没有见你像今天这么美过。我和朗太太交换意见的时候，她也是这么夸你的。你猜她还说了些什么？‘啊！贝内特太太，她终究要嫁到尼瑟费德的。’她的的确确是这么说的。我觉得朗太太不愧是一个大好人。她的那些侄女虽然貌不出众，但个个举止文雅，真是讨人喜欢。”

总而言之，贝内特太太的情绪实在高涨极了。她把宾利对简的一言一行都看在眼里，确信他最终将属于简。她一时想入非非，指望这门亲事会给她的家庭带来种种好处，可是等到第二天仍不见他来求婚，于是又感到十分失望。

“今天过得真是愉快极啦，”简对伊丽莎白说道，“赴宴的客人挑选得都非常合适，大家相处得很融洽。但愿以后能常常这样欢聚一堂。”伊丽莎白笑了笑。“丽茨，你不该这样笑我，也不该怀疑我，那会叫我伤心的。老实告诉你，我喜欢和他谈话，是因为他既和气又有见识。我并没有别的非分的念头。他现在的态度很坦然，决无半点讨好我的意思，这一点使我十分满意。与其他人所不同的是，他说出来的话非常悦耳，而且对所有的人都非常随和。”

“你可真是狠心，嘴上说不准我笑，但实际上每时每刻都在逗我发笑。”做妹妹的说。

“有些事情怎么说也叫人难以相信！”

“有些事令人无法置信！”

“你为什么偏偏要以为我心口不一呢？”

“这个问题真不知让我怎么回答才好。人人都喜欢说冠冕堂皇的话，可是这些话又没人愿听，恕我直言，以后不管怎么声称无心于他，都别指望我会相信。”

第五十五章


这次拜访之后没过几天，宾利先生又来了，而且是单独来的。他的朋友当天早晨和他辞别，到伦敦去了，不过十天以内还要回来。宾利在主人家坐了一个多小时，显得非常高兴。贝内特太太留他吃饭，可他一再表示歉意，说他在别处另有约会。

贝内特太太只得说：“下次来的时候，希望能赏个脸。”

“如果您不讨厌我，我随时都能来府上叨扰，并随时听候你们的支配。”

“你明天能来吗？”

“可以来，因为我明天有的是时间。”宾利欣然接受了贝内特太太的邀请。

第二天他果然来了，而且来得非常早，太太小姐们还都没有梳妆打扮。贝内特太太头发才梳理了一半，便穿着晨衣跑进了女儿的闺房，大声喊叫道：“亲爱的简，快收拾一下，然后下楼来。他来啦——宾利先生来啦。这可是千真万确的。喂，萨拉，赶快到贝内特小姐这儿来，帮她把衣服穿上，先不要管丽茨小姐的头发。”

“我们尽快下去，”简说，“吉蒂比我们哪一个都麻利，她下楼去已有半个小时了。”

“唉，这个死丫头，她急着去凑什么热闹？你可快点呀，不要再磨蹭啦！你的腰带哪里去了，宝贝？”

母亲走后，简说什么也不肯一个人下楼，非得拉一个妹妹作陪不可。

到了傍晚，贝内特太太又急了，光想着让宾利和她的大女儿单独待待。饮过茶后，贝内特先生退到书房里去了，这是他的老习惯；玛丽上楼练琴。五个障碍这一下去掉了两个。贝太太坐在那儿，一个劲向伊丽莎白和凯瑟琳挤眼，可那两人半天都没反应过来。伊丽莎白对她连瞧也不瞧，而吉蒂虽然最终看到了她丢来的眼色，却天真地说：“您怎么啦，妈妈？怎么老冲着我挤眼呢？您想叫我做什么？”

“不做什么，孩子，什么也不做。我并没有对你挤眼呀。”

贝太太说完，又耐着性子坐了五分钟，后来觉得这种宝贵时机不该错过，于是便突然站起了身，对吉蒂说道：“跟我来，宝贝，我有话和你说。”随即，她把吉蒂拽出了房间。简望了伊丽莎白一眼，似乎在为母亲的出乖露丑感到难过。她以眼神央求伊丽莎白不要屈从母亲的摆布。

过了不大一会儿，贝太太把门推开了一条缝喊道：“丽茨，我的宝贝，我想跟你说句话。”

伊丽莎白只得走出了房间。来到了过厅里，母亲对她说道：“你知道，咱们最好不要打搅他们。我和吉蒂可以上楼，到我的梳妆室里去。”

伊丽莎白没有和母亲争辩，而是一动不动地待在过厅里，等到母亲和吉蒂从视野里消失后，才回到了客厅里。

贝太太这一天的计划没有达到预期的效果。宾利样样都讨人喜欢，可就是没向她的大女儿求婚。他落落大方、谈笑风生，成了她们家庭晚会上顶顶中意的客人。贝太太总是不合时宜地乱献殷勤，尽说些蠢话，可他却处之泰然、不动声色，这叫简十分感激。

主人请他留下吃晚饭，而他几乎没加推辞便应允了。在他临别之际，由贝太太和他约定，让他第二天早晨来同她的丈夫一道打鸟。

自打这天起，简再也不说对他无所谓了。她和伊丽莎白所谈的话虽然没有一句涉及宾利，但伊丽莎白上床睡觉时，心里非常快活，认为达西只要在这几天里不露面，这门亲事很快就能见个眉目。不过她又觉得，事情进行到这一步，一定是得到了达西的恩准。

翌日，宾利准时来赴约。如事先商量好的那样，他和贝内特先生在一起打了一上午的鸟。相处之中，他发现贝先生比他想象的要和气得多。说起来，这还是因为他自己没有傲气，没有做蠢事，要不然贝先生一定会怪话连篇或者由于厌恶而一声不吭。今天贝先生显得比较健谈，也不似平时那么古怪了，这是极少见的现象。两人尽兴之后，宾利跟他一块回来吃饭。到了晚上，贝太太又想出了种种借口，把大伙儿从宾利以及大女儿的身边支开。伊丽莎白有封信要写，于是喝过晚茶后便进了早餐厅动起了笔墨。她看到其他人都坐下来打牌，觉得自己这一次不便再跟母亲唱对台戏。

她写完信后回到客厅时，看到了一副叫人万分吃惊的情景，这下她觉得母亲到底比她有远见得多。因为她一推开门，瞧见姐姐和宾利一起站在壁炉跟前，似乎正谈得热火朝天。本来光凭这一点不足以引起她的疑心，可是只要看看那一对人的脸色，看看他们慌忙扭身分开的窘态，便可以叫她心中有数了。按说他俩的处境已经够尴尬了，而她觉得自己更尴尬。宾利和简坐了下来，谁都没有吭气。伊丽莎白正待走开，却见宾利猛地站起来，和她姐姐咬了咬耳朵，然后跑出了屋子。

简有了高兴的事，从来就不瞒伊丽莎白，于是她立即抱住妹妹，激动万分地声称自己是世界上最幸福的人。

“太幸福啦，太幸福啦，”她连声说道，“我真是不配哩。为什么不能人人都这样幸福呢？”

伊丽莎白连忙向她贺喜，那种真诚、热情和高兴的劲儿用语言实在难以形容。每听到一句亲切的话，简就感到心里多一份喜悦。但眼下她不能和妹妹待得太久，心里的话连一半也来不及说。

“我必须马上去见妈妈，”她喊道，“无论如何也不能让她老人家再为我牵肠挂肚了。这事得由我亲口告诉她。宾利先生已去找咱们的父亲了。啊，丽茨，家里人听到这消息不知会有多高兴呢！这天大的幸福叫我怎么承受得了啊！”

说罢，她忙着去找母亲报喜了。这时的贝太太已经有意识地解散了牌场，正由吉蒂陪着坐在楼上等待。

伊丽莎白待姐姐走开后，回想起她们全家人为这门亲事怄了好几个月的气，而现在转眼之间一切事情都轻而易举地得到了解决。想到此处，她不由笑了。

她在心里嘀咕道：“他的那位朋友煞费苦心，却落得这样的结局！这也是他的妹妹自欺欺人的结果！这是最幸福、最圆满、最合理的结局！”

过了几分钟的时间，宾利走了进来。他与她父亲虽然谈得时间不长，但达到了他的目的。

“你姐姐哪里去啦！”他一推开门便劈头盖脸地问道。

“上楼找我母亲了，马上就会下来的。”

宾利关上门，走到伊丽莎白跟前，准备接受妹妹亲切而美好的祝愿。伊丽莎白诚恳衷心地表达了自己的喜悦，为这门亲事表示祝贺。他俩亲切地握了手。接下来，宾利滔滔不绝地描绘起他是多么幸福，而简是多么完美。伊丽莎白只好洗耳恭听，直至简从楼上走下来。这些话虽然出自一个坠人情网的人之口，但伊丽莎白却深信不疑，认为他对幸福的憧憬完全可以变为现实，简善于体察人意，性格完美无瑕，再加上他们二人情投意合，志趣又极为相似，这一切都为他们的婚姻奠定了基础。

这天晚上，大家都感到非常高兴。简由于心里得意，容颜显得娇艳美丽，比平常更加漂亮。吉蒂也笑容满面，希望幸运之神能尽快光顾她。贝内特太太和宾利足足谈了半个小时，对他的求婚表示首肯和认可，但末了还总是觉得没有把自己恳切的心意转达清楚。贝内特先生和大家一道吃晚饭的时候，从他的一言一行便足以见得他是多么地快活。

不过在客人跟前，他却对这门亲事只字不提。待客人刚一离开，他就冲着大女儿说道：

“简，祝贺你喽。你一定会成为一个非常幸福的妻子。”

简当即走上前去，吻了吻他，感谢了他的好意。

贝先生又说道：“你是个好孩子。看到你有了一个幸福的归宿，真为你感到高兴。毫无疑问，你们一定能相处得非常好，因为你们俩在性格上极为相似。你们都是那样谦恭，因而事事都拿不定主意；你们态度随和，所以用人都会欺负你们；你们又是如此慷慨，到头来一定入不敷出。”

“但愿事情并非如此。在涉及钱财的问题上我绝不会掉以轻心。”

“入不敷出！亲爱的贝内特先生，”贝太太嚷道，“你这算是什么话呀？他每年有四五千镑的进项，或许还不止呢。”接着，她又把话锋转向了大女儿，“啊，我的宝贝简呀，我真是太高兴啦，今天晚上又要彻夜失眠了。我早就知道会这样，并一直说这才是事情的必然结局。我相信你长得貌若天仙，一定会引来如意郎君！记得去年他初来哈福德郡的时候，我一见到他就产生了一种想法，觉得你们俩很可能会成双配对。啧，他可是个我所见到的最漂亮的小伙子！”

她把威克姆和莉迪亚忘了个干干净净，简一下子成了她的掌上明珠。这工夫，别的人她一个也不放在心上。几个小妹妹马上和简热乎了起来，希望她将来能给她们点光沾沾。

玛丽请求使用尼瑟费德的书房；吉蒂也死乞白赖地提出要求，想每年冬天在尼瑟费德举办几场舞会。

自此，宾利成了浪搏恩府上每天必来的客人。他经常在早饭前赶来，每一次都要待吃完晚饭后才走。除非哪位没有眼色，又不怕惹人厌恶的邻居硬要请他去赴宴，他才不得已去应酬应酬。

伊丽莎白现在几乎没有机会和姐姐交谈，因为有宾利在跟前，姐姐就不愿答理其他的人。不过，有时候这对情侣暂时分离，她还是觉得自己对他们是蛮有用的。简不在跟前的时候，宾利总要缠住她，跟她津津有味地谈论简；而宾利告辞回家后，简总是来找她解闷。

一天晚上，简对她说：“他告诉我，去年春天他一点也不知道我也进了城，这实在叫人感到高兴！我原来就不相信他知道我进城的消息。”

“我当时也感到纳闷呢。”伊丽莎白说，“他是怎么解释的？”

“那都是他的姐姐和妹妹从中作梗。她们当然是不愿意让他和我接近喽。不过这也难怪，因为他完全可以物色一个各方面都比我强得多的姑娘。她们要是看到她们的兄弟和我在一起能得到幸福，我相信她们一定会回心转意。到那时，我们虽然不可能像从前那样亲密无间，但起码又可以友好相处了。”

伊丽莎白说：“我可是第一次听你说这么没有肚量的话。我的好姐姐，说句老实话，如果再看到你上当受骗，被宾利小姐的虚情假意所蒙蔽，我会为你感到伤心的！”

“丽茨，不知你相信不相信，他去年十一月进城的时候，是真心爱我的。不是为了别的原因，而是由于他听信了别人的话，认为我对他无情无意，才没有来找我！”

“这肯定是一场小小的误会。不过，那都是因为他太虚心啦。”

简一听，便夸奖起宾利来，说他为人谦虚，从不炫耀自己身上的优点。

伊丽莎白感到高兴的是，宾利没有把他的朋友横加干涉的事情抖搂出来。即便简有一颗天底下最仁慈、最宽怀的心，如果让她了解到真相，她就难免会对达西产生偏见。

“我当之无愧地是全世界最幸运的人，”简大声说道，“丽茨呀丽茨，我的亲人为什么不能和我一样幸运呢！为什么不能和我一样受到祝福呢！但愿你也可以寻觅到幸福！但愿你也能碰上一位这样的郎君！”

“你就是送给我四十位这样的郎君，我也不会像你这样幸福。除非把你温和的脾气以及善良的心肠给了我，我才能品味到你这样的幸福！不，不，还是让我顺其自然吧。如果我福星高照，也许到时候我会再遇上一位柯林斯先生。”

浪搏恩府上所发生的事情再也不能成为秘密了。先是贝内特太太悄悄把这事告诉了菲利普斯太太，而后者未经任何人的允许，竟然把消息传给了麦里屯她的街坊四邻。

记得仅在几星期之前，当莉迪亚的私奔东窗事发后，人们一致认为贝内特一家倒了邪霉。而现在转瞬之间，这一家又成了天底下最幸运的人啦。





第五十六章


宾利和简订婚已经有一个星期的光景了。有天早晨，他和贝家的太太小姐们正坐在餐厅里闲谈，忽然听到一阵马车声，于是大家立刻凑到了窗户跟前。只见一辆驷马大车贴着草坪驶了过来。这么一大早，不是来客的时间。再看看那车马装备，便知道来人不是他们的邻居。马儿全都是驿站上雇来的。至于那车辆以及跟车的仆人所穿的号衣，对他们来说都很眼生。不过有一点是肯定的，那就是有人来访。宾利立即劝简跟他去矮树林里散步，免得让不速之客缠住不得脱身。他们俩拔腿走了，另外的三个留下来猜测个不停，但就是猜不出来的是何人。后来门打开了，客人走了进来。原来是凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人！

贝家母女预料到来人会让她们感到意外，可没想到她们竟会如此惊愕。贝太太及吉蒂虽说和凯瑟琳夫人素昧平生，但她们甚至比伊丽莎白还感到诧异。

凯瑟琳夫人带着一种极端不礼貌的神气走进了大厅，仅仅冲着和她打招呼的伊丽莎白微微点了下头，便坐了下来，连一句话也没说。她进门之际，没有要求伊丽莎白为她作介绍，但伊丽莎白还是把她的尊名大姓告诉了母亲。

贝太太的确惊诧万状，不过这样一位贵客登门拜访，又叫她感到荣幸，于是便客客气气地加以接待。凯瑟琳夫人默默坐了一会儿。然后冷冰冰地对伊丽莎白说：

“我想你一定过得很好。这位太太大概是你的母亲吧？”

伊丽莎白没有多话，只回答了声是。

“而那位大概是你的妹妹吧？”

“不错，夫人。”贝太太插嘴说，心里为能跟凯瑟琳夫人讲话而感到万分高兴，“她排行倒数第二。我们最小的一个女儿最近嫁了人，而大女儿这工夫正同一位年轻人在外边散步。那小伙子很快将成为我们家的一个成员。”

“你们的庄园确实够小的了。”凯瑟琳夫人没有立时回话，过了片刻之后才这么说道。

“当然无法与罗辛斯庄园相比，夫人。不过我敢说，这儿比威廉·卢卡斯爵士的庄园却要宽敞得多了。”

“夏天的傍晚在这个房间里纳凉多有不便，因为这儿的窗户全朝西开。”

贝太太告诉她说，家里人吃过饭后从不在此处待。随后她又说道：

“我是否可以冒昧地问夫人一声：您来的时候，柯林斯夫妇都还好吧？”

“很好，非常好。我前天晚上还见到了他们。”

伊丽莎白满以为她会拿出一封夏洛特托转的信来，因为这似乎是她来这儿的唯一动机。可是迟迟不见她出示夏洛特的信，于是伊丽莎白如坠五里云雾，感到十分困惑。

贝太太毕恭毕敬地恳请这位贵人吃些点心，可是凯瑟琳夫人什么也不肯吃，回绝得十分坚决，十分没有礼貌。接着，凯瑟琳夫人站起身对伊丽莎白说：

“贝内特小姐，你们家草坪的那端似乎有点荒原的景色，倒是比较别致。我很想到那儿溜达溜达，不知你是否肯作陪？”

“去吧，我的宝贝，”贝太太嚷嚷道，“领夫人到各条小径上走走。但愿她能喜欢上这块幽静的小地方。”

伊丽莎白只好从命，跑回闺房取了把阳伞，陪着她家的贵客下了楼。从走廊里穿过时，凯瑟琳夫人推开餐厅和客厅的门，朝里边扫了两眼，说这两个厅堂看上去挺不错，然后又继续往前走。

她的马车仍然停放在大门口，伊丽莎白瞧见她的侍女坐在里边。她们走上了一条通向小树林的石子路，默默无语地朝前挪动着脚步。伊丽莎白觉得这位女人比往常更傲慢、更让人讨厌，因此拿定主意绝不主动跟她搭腔。

她望了望凯瑟琳夫人的面孔，心里不由想道：“她怎么一点也不像她的外甥呀？”

一走进小树林，凯瑟琳夫人便以这样的腔调来了个开场白：

“贝内特小姐，你是个明白人，一定知道我到这儿来的原因。你的心以及你的良知一定会告诉你，我为什么要来此处。”

伊丽莎白面露惊愕之色。

“夫人，您完全错了。我根本说不清，自己怎么会荣幸地在这儿看到您。”

凯瑟琳夫人一听，怒气冲冲地说：“贝内特小姐，你应该清楚，我可不是让人戏弄的。不管你怎么不严肃，我可没有闲心开玩笑。我是个直肠子，说话历来诚恳爽快。两天之前，我听到了一个极为惊人的消息——不光是你的姐姐攀上了一户阔绰人家，马上就要结婚，就连你也可能不久便要同我的外甥——我的亲外甥达西先生结亲。虽然我知道这是谣传，虽然我不愿猜忌达西，不愿把这件事情当真，但我还是当机立断，决定来这儿走走，向你表达我的意思。”

伊丽莎白由于诧异和鄙夷，满脸涨得通红。只听她说道：“既然您不相信这件事是真的，那我认为您不必费心劳神地跑这么老远。请问您老人家究竟有什么想法？”

“我是想请你立刻辟谣，对此事作作解释。”

伊丽莎白不冷不热地说：“如果真有这种谣，您赶到浪搏恩来看望我和我的家人反而会弄巧成拙，让人们信以为真。”

“哼，如果！你装什么糊涂呀？难道不是你们在背后干下的勾当，不是你们在散布谣言吗？你难道不知道这件事现已传得满城风雨了吗？”

“我从来没听人讲起过。”

“那你敢不敢说，这件事毫无根据呢？”

“我可不如您老人家那般坦率。有些问题您尽可以提出来。而我却不愿回答。”

“岂有此理！贝内特小姐，我非要你说个明白不可。我的外甥向你求过婚吗？！”

“您已经说过，绝不会有这种事情。”

“的确不应该有这种事情。只要他是个理智的人，就不会那样做。不过，你也许施展手段诱惑他，使他淡忘了自己的身份，淡忘了他对自己的家族应负的责任。总之，你可能迷住了他。”

“倘若果真如此，我是绝不会承认的。”

“贝内特小姐，你知道我是什么人吗？还没有人这样对我说过话呢。我可以说是他在这个世界上最亲的人了，所以有权过问他的终身大事。”

“可您没权过问我的终身大事，就凭您的这种态度，也休想逼我讲出真话。”

“让我把话挑明吧。尽管你千方百计想攀这门亲，但那只是痴心妄想。你永远也别指望成功。达西先生已经和我的女儿订了婚。现在，你有什么可说的呢？”

“只有一句话可说：如果他已订了婚，那您就没有理由怀疑他会向我求婚。”

凯瑟琳夫人踌躇了片刻，然后答道：

“说起他们俩的婚约，那可是非同寻常的。他们从小就许定了终身，这是双方母亲的共同心愿。他们还在摇篮里的时候，我们就打算让他们长大后结为夫妻。眼看我们两姐妹的心愿就要实现的时候，谁知半路上竟插进来一个出身卑微、地位低贱，与这个家族没有丝毫瓜葛的小妮子！难道你一点也不顾及他亲友的愿望，不顾及他和德布尔小姐都心照不宣的婚约吗？难道你连一点体统也不顾，连一点廉耻也不知道吗？难道你没听我说起过，他和他的表妹自小就许定了终身吗？”

“不错，这话我以前倒是有所耳闻。但这与我有何干呢？如果没有其他的理由阻止我嫁给您的外甥，那我绝不会因为他的母亲和姨妈希望他娶德布尔小姐，就却步不前。你们姐妹俩费尽心机筹划了这桩亲事，但美梦是否能成真还得取决于别人。假如达西先生既无义务，又无意愿娶他的表妹，他为什么不能另作选择呢？要是他选中了我，我为什么不可以接受他的求婚呢？”

“就因为你们必须顾及荣誉、脸面以及自己的良心，还有，从利害关系上讲，你们也不能这样做。如果你一意孤行，触犯了众怒，那你休想让他的亲友看得起你，你会四面树敌，受到他周围人的谴责、蔑视和厌恶。你们的结合会成为一种耻辱。到了那时，我们甚至都不屑于提起你的名字。”

“这真是天大的不幸，”伊丽莎白答道，“不过，要是能当上达西先生的太太，倒也相当荣耀，所以自会有其乐趣。从总体来说，没有什么可懊悔的。”

“你这丫头真是死心眼，顽固不化！我为你感到害臊。去年春天我那般厚待你，难道你就这样报答我？难道你就不懂得知恩图报的道理？咱们还是坐下来好好谈谈。你要明白，贝内特小姐，我是抱着不达目的誓不罢休的决心到这儿来的。所以，不管你说什么都别想让我改变主意。你别指望耍几个花招，就让我鸣金收兵。我的愿望还从来没有落空过。”

“这只能使您老人家目前的处境更加可悲，而对我却皮毛不损。”

“我说话不许你插嘴！老实听我把话讲完。我的女儿和我外甥是天造地设的一对。他们的母亲都有贵族血统；他们的父亲虽然没有承袭封号，但都出身古老的名门望族；他们无论是哪一方面都拥有巨额财富。我们两家的每一个人都认为他们俩是前世注定的夫妻。而你这个妮子，一无门第，二无贵亲，三无财产，却痴心妄想地企图把他们拆散。这口气能让人咽得下去吗？是可忍，孰不可忍，如果你稍有些自知之明，就不会置自己的出身于不顾。”

“我觉得，和您的外甥结婚并不意味着不顾自己的出身。他是位绅士，而我是绅士的女儿，因而我们是门当户对。”

“不错，你可以说是绅士的女儿，可你妈妈算什么样的人？还有你的那些舅父舅妈和姨父姨母呢？别以为我不了解他们的底细。”

伊丽莎白回敬道：“不管我的亲戚是什么样的人，都与您毫不相干，只要您的外甥不计较就行了。”

“请痛痛快快告诉我，你究竟跟他订婚了没有？”

伊丽莎白本不想买凯瑟琳夫人的账，不想回答这个问题，但后来思忖了一下，便如实地说道：“没有。”

凯瑟琳夫人听后，不由面露喜色。

“你肯不肯答应我，永远也不同他缔结婚约？”

“我绝不作这方面的许诺。”

“贝内特小姐，你真让人感到吃惊。没想到你如此不明事理。可你别打错了算盘，以为我会作出让步。假如你不按照我的要求作出承诺，我就不离开这儿。”

“我绝不会做这种承诺。别以为你吓唬吓唬我，就能让我答应您极端无理的要求。夫人您固然希望达西先生娶您的千金，可即便我按您的要求许下了诺言，难道这就能使他们结下百年之好吗？假如达西先生爱的是我，难道就因为我拒绝了他的求婚，他会把爱倾注在他的表妹身上吗？恕我直言，凯瑟琳夫人，您的要求实在荒唐，您的观点也实在浅薄。要是您以为说几句吓人的话就能逼我屈服，那您就把我看扁了。您的外甥究竟给了您多大的权利让您插手他的事情，这我可说不清。不过，您可是没有任何权利干涉我的事。因此，我请求您不要再为这事难为我了。”

“请你不要性急么，我还没把话说完呢。我之所以反对你和我外甥结亲，除了以上所提到的那些理由，我还要补充一点。别以为你小妹妹私奔的丑事能瞒过我的眼睛，我可是对所有的细节都了如指掌。最后落得你父亲和舅舅为她破费，出面收拾残局，那位年轻人才娶了她，这样的女孩子哪配做我外甥的小姨子呢？她的丈夫，也就是达西先父的管家生下的孽子，能配得上做我外甥的连襟吗？老天爷呀，你到底打的是什么主意？彭伯里的门第就这么给人糟蹋吗？”

伊丽莎白愤怒地说：“现在你该讲完啦，也算把我侮辱够了。我可要回家去了。”

她说着便站起了身，凯瑟琳夫人也跟着站了起来。于是，二人迈步朝回走。这位贵夫人气得简直快炸了肺。

“这么说，你一点也不顾及我外甥的荣誉以及名声喽！真是个无情无义、自私自利的丫头！你就没想到吗，他和你结成为夫妻，所有的人都会因此而看不起他？”

“凯瑟琳夫人，我再没有什么可说的了。我的意思已经表达得很清楚了。”

“那你非得把他搞到手不可啦？”

“我可没说过这种话。我只不过自有主张，觉得我所干的事情能使我幸福就行了，才不管您或者任何其他局外之人会怎么说呢。”

“好啊，你是执意不听我的劝告了。你真是个忘恩负义的小人，不知道廉耻，一点脸面都不顾。看来你决心要毁掉他，让朋友们瞧不起他，使他成为天下所有人的笑料。”

伊丽莎白说：“什么忘恩负义啦、不知廉耻啦、不顾脸面啦，全和这件事沾不上边。即便我嫁给达西先生，也不见得就触犯了这些道德规范。如果说他和我结了婚，会激起他家人的愤慨，那我才不在乎呢。至于说天下人都会因此嘲笑我们，我倒认为大多数人都明辨是非，不会跟着起哄。”

“我算是听到了你的真心话，领教到了你的强硬态度！走着瞧吧，我知道怎么对付你。贝内特小姐，别以为你的幻想能够实现。我到这儿来不过是想试探试探你。没想到你这么不通情理。不要得意得太早了，我会达到目的的。”

凯瑟琳夫人就这么慷慨激昂地说个不停，一直走到马车门前。然后，她来了个急转身，又说出了下边一番话：

“我不愿跟你说辞别的话，贝内特小姐，也不愿问候你的母亲，因为我心里不高兴极啦，觉得你们母女不配受这样的礼遇。”

伊丽莎白没有吱声，没有请她进屋坐坐，而是自顾自地踏进了门槛。她上楼的时候，听到马车隆隆地驶走了。母亲心急地跑到梳妆室门口迎接她，问起凯瑟琳夫人为什么不进屋来歇歇脚再走。

“她不愿进来，所以就走啦。”女儿说。

“她是个非常有姿色的女人！她特意到咱们家来，真是太客气了，我想，她只是想来把柯林斯夫妇的情况告诉咱们一声？她大概是到什么地方去，路过麦里屯，心想不妨来你这儿坐坐。她可能没跟你说什么特殊的事情吧，丽茨？”

伊丽莎白不得不撒了几句谎话，因为她实在没法说出她和凯瑟琳夫人谈话的内容。





第五十七章


不速之客离去之后，伊丽莎白的心里失去了平静，一下子很难稳定住情绪。一连数个小时，她的脑子里装的全是这件事情。看来，凯瑟琳夫人一定是以为她和达西先生订了婚，才不辞劳苦地从罗辛斯庄园赶来，企图把他们俩拆散。她算计得可真是周到！不过，伊丽莎白想象不到，她和达西订婚的这阵风是怎么刮起来的。后来她有了些灵性，觉得达西是宾利的好友，而她又是简的妹妹，这就容易引起人们的联想。现在，简的婚礼已指日可待，人们势必会以为另一桩婚事也为期不远了。就连她自己也曾经想到过，姐姐的婚事可以为她搭座鹊桥，使她和达西有更多的机会接触。她芳心萌动，期望着总有一天能和达西缔结婚约。本来这只是一种期望，而卢卡斯府里的人却把此事看得十拿九稳，而且迫在眉睫。他们八成在给柯林斯夫妇的信中提到过此事，风声就这样传到了凯瑟琳夫人那儿。

回想起凯瑟琳夫人当时的那席话，她心里总有些不安。她暗忖：如果凯瑟琳夫人真的不断从中作梗，后果会怎么样呢？那位贵夫人曾声称要不惜一切代价阻止他们的婚姻，这就使伊丽莎白不由想到，她肯定会向她外甥施加压力。至于达西是否会接受姨妈的观点，觉得同她结亲有百害而无一利，那她就不敢说了。她不知道他和他姨妈的感情有多深，不知他对姨妈是否言听计从。不过应该想象得到，他对自己姨妈的敬意，肯定会超过她伊丽莎白。只要姨妈向他指明，和一个门户不当的姑娘结婚，一定会让他吃尽苦头，那就会击中他的要害之处。在伊丽莎白看来，这些观点荒谬可笑、不值一驳，但达西是个讲体面的人，也许会觉得姨妈的话理由充足、合情也合理。

如果他本来就动摇不定（他似乎经常如此），那么现在让一位近亲指点几句、开导几句，很可能会打消犹豫的心情，以致改变初衷。他将在不贬低身份的情况下去追求幸福。倘若事情果真如此，他就不会再回到这里来了。凯瑟琳夫人路过城里的时候，可能去找他，让他放弃与宾利的约会，再也不回到尼瑟费德来。

伊丽莎白心里又想：“要是几天之内他给宾利写信来，找个理由说他不能践约，那我便一切都明白了。那时我将不再抱任何希望，不再指望他会坚定不移地爱我。现在他完全可以赢得我的爱，而且我还会答应他的求婚。可如果他不再爱我，只是为我感到惋惜，那么，我恐怕连惋惜的心情也会消失得无影无踪。”

家里人听说来了一位贵宾，都惊奇得不得了。可是她们也像贝内特太太那样作了些揣测，总算满足了好奇心，才没有对伊丽莎白问这问那。

次日早晨，伊丽莎白下楼的时候，遇见父亲从书房里走了出来，手里拿着一封信。

父亲说道：“丽茨，我正要去找你呢。请到我书房来一下。”

伊丽莎白跟着他来到了书房里，不知他要对自己说些什么。她觉得事情可能与他手里的信有关，于是心里越发感到好奇。这时，她突然想到，那封信可能是出自凯瑟琳夫人的手笔。接着，她恐慌地盘算起来，看怎样向父亲作解释。

父女俩一前一后走到壁炉前，坐了下来。只听做父亲的说：

“今天早晨我刚刚收到一封信，实在叫我吃惊不小。由于信里主要讲的是你的事情，所以应该把内容告诉你。没想到我的两个女儿都快要做人家的新娘了。祝贺你征服了一个重要人物。”

伊丽莎白立即断定这封信来自达西，而不是他的姨妈。想到这里，她顿时绯红了脸。她心里非常矛盾，不知该为达西来信表抒衷曲感到高兴，还是怪他没有直接给她写信而生气。此刻，只听父亲又说道：

“你看起来像心中有数似的。年轻小姐对这类事情具有非凡的洞察力。可我却认为，你虽然悟性较高，却悟不出你的崇拜者姓甚名谁。告诉你吧，这封信是柯林斯先生寄来的。”

“柯林斯先生！他有什么话可说呢？”

“当然是非常重要的话了。他先是恭喜我的大女儿马上就要出嫁，这消息似乎是卢府的哪位爱管闲事的好心人传过去的。他的这些话我就不一一念给你听了，免得你不耐烦。与你有关的部分是这样写的：‘此乃大喜大庆之事，在下及内人竭诚祝贺。另外，在下还风闻一事，源于同一人之口，容在下再进几言。据云，尊府大小姐出阁之后，二小姐亦将出阁。二女以命运相托之人实乃大富大贵者。’

“丽茨，你能猜得出他指的是谁吗？‘此人年轻福洪，举凡人间仰慕之物，莫不样样具有：家财雄厚，门第高贵，布施提携，权力无边。唯彼虽属条件优越，处处足以打动人心，然则彼若向尊府求婚，切不可草草应承，否则后患无穷。希伊丽莎白表妹及先生谨记在下告诫之情。’

“丽茨，你现在知道那位贵人是谁了吗？下文就提到了。

“‘在下所以不揣冒昧，直言不讳，实因虑及贵人之姨妈凯瑟琳·德布尔夫人万难恩准这桩婚事。’

“明白了吧，他所讲的是达西先生！丽茨，我想你一定感到十分意外。柯林斯也好，卢卡斯一家也好，怎么偏偏在咱们的熟人中选出这个人来制造谎言，这岂不太容易让人看穿了么？达西先生见到女人就觉得晦气，也许他从没正眼瞧过你呢！真是太妙啦！”

伊丽莎白本想跟着父亲一道打趣，却提不起兴致来，只是勉强地挤出了一个苦笑。父亲的幽默感变了味道，从来没像今天这样令她不悦。

“你不觉得滑稽吗？”

“哦，当然！请您朝下念。”

“‘昨晚在下向夫人禀呈此事可能成真，蒙夫人本其平日错爱之忱，即直抒隐衷。彼谓此亲不可赞同，盖因令嫒门户低微，难攀高枝。若竟与其联姻，实在有失体统。在下自忖责无旁贷，应将此情及早奉告表妹，希表妹及其爱慕之贵人皆可深明大义，以免胆大妄为、私订终身。’——柯林斯先生还说：‘莉迪亚表妹那件丑事得以圆满解决，殊为欣慰。在下每每想起表妹婚前即与人同居，臭名远扬，不免有所痛心。闻那对男女一经结为夫妻，先生随接纳入府，在下为之骇然。先生此举实系助长伤风败俗之恶习。设以鄙人为浪搏恩牧师，必竭力反对。先生身为基督教徒，理应宽恕为怀，然当拒见其人，拒闻其名。’——这就是他的所谓基督徒的宽恕精神！下边写的净是他那亲爱的夏洛特的状况，说他们快要生贵子了。怎么，丽茨，你好像听了有些不高兴。你可不要耍小姐脾气，听了几句闲言碎语便生起气来。人生在世，免不了让街坊四邻当做笑柄，但反过来我们也可以嘲笑他们。”

伊丽莎白不由大声喊道：“听起来倒挺有趣，就是显得太怪了！”

“是这样的，可这也正是有趣之处。他们指的要是另外一个人，倒也说得过去。令人啼笑皆非的是，他们竟然选中了达西先生。那位贵人完全没把你放在眼里，而你对他又厌恶透顶！平时我最讨厌写信，可我无论如何也不愿和柯林斯先生断绝书信来往。我的女婿又冒失又虚伪，很得我的欣赏。但是读了柯林斯的信后，我觉得他比威克姆更讨人喜欢。请问，丽茨，凯瑟琳夫人对这件事是怎么说的？她是不是特地赶来表示反对？”

女儿听到父亲这样问她，只是付之一笑。其实，父亲问归问，心里却毫无猜疑的意思，因此任他问了又问，她一点也不感到慌张。她从未这般为难过，心里想的是一套，而表面上却要装出另一套。有时她直想大哭一场，却又不得不强作笑颜。父亲说达西先生一点也未把她放在眼里，这就残酷地刺疼了她的心。她埋怨父亲太迟钝、太缺乏观察力，但同时她又感到害怕，唯恐自己在判断上除了差错——并非父亲看到的太少，而是她幻想太多。





第五十八章


伊丽莎白本来以为达西会写信来，取消他和宾利的约会。然而，宾利却没有接到这样的信，而是在凯瑟琳夫人来访后不几天，把达西本人带到了浪搏恩来。两位先生来得可谓相当早。伊丽莎白心里七上八下。生怕母亲把见到凯瑟琳夫人的事儿告诉给达西，幸好没等母亲开口，宾利建议大家都出去走走，这是因为他想和简单独在一起。这个建议得到众人的响应。只是贝内特太太没有散步的习惯，而玛丽从来不肯浪费时间。其他的五个人只好丢下她们走了。刚一出门，宾利和简就让别人先走，而自己落在了后面。伊丽莎白、吉蒂以及达西三人走在一起。他们三个全都默默寡语：吉蒂过于害怕达西，因而不敢说话；伊丽莎白心里有事，正在酝酿一项重大的决定；达西或许也在想心事。

他们向卢卡斯家走去。因为吉蒂想去看望玛丽亚。伊丽莎白觉得没有必要大家一块到卢家去。待吉蒂离开他们之后，她鼓足勇气跟着达西继续溜达。她觉得现在已经到了摊牌的时候。于是，她大着胆子说出了下面一番话：

“达西先生，我是个自私自利的人，只图自己心里痛快，说出的话也不管会不会伤害你的感情。你对我的那位可怜的妹妹恩重如山，事情到了现在，我不得不表达一下我的感激之情了。自从我知道了内幕情况之后，就一心想对你好好道声谢。我家里的人要是全了解详情，那么向你表示谢意的就不止我一个人了。”

“我感到遗憾，十分遗憾，”达西说话时，声调既惊讶又激动，“居然让你知道了这些情况，说不定会产生误解，使你为此而伤心。没想到加德纳太太这样不可信任。”

“这怪不得我舅妈。当初莉迪亚说漏了嘴，才使我联想到你与此事有关。我当然得查清事实，否则我是不会罢休的。请允许我代表我全家再次向你表示感谢，感谢你深明大义，不辞劳苦地慷慨相助，感谢你忍辱负重，四处奔忙寻找他们的下落。”

达西说：“要谢我，你代表你自己就行了。我不想否认，我所以那样做，除了别的原因以外，也是为了让你高兴，你家里的人不用谢我。我虽然尊敬他们，但我认为自己当时心里想到的只有你一个。”

伊丽莎白窘得一句话也说不出来。隔了一会儿，她的朋友又说道：“你是个有度量的人，不会捉弄我。如果你的态度一如往初，和去年四月份一样，就请痛快地告诉我。我的感情和心愿一直未变，不过只要你说一句回绝的话，这件事我将永远不再提起。”

伊丽莎白十分体谅他，知道他的处境非常窘迫，同时也了解他的心情很迫切，于是她不得不表露自己的心迹。只听她吞吞吐吐地说，自从上次听了他的解释之后，她的思想发生了巨变。现在，她对他充满了感激之情，非常愿意接受他的一切要求。这种回答使达西产生了一种从未有过的喜悦感。他抓住时机，立刻以无限聪慧、无限热烈的语言向她倾吐衷曲，一看就晓得他是一个深深陷入情网的恋人。伊丽莎白假如在这时候抬起头看看他的那双眼睛，便可以在那里瞧见一股喜气洋洋的神色。这种喜气令达西满面生辉，使他显得越发英俊潇洒。遗憾的是，伊丽莎白不敢抬头瞧他，只是竖耳倾听着他的声音。达西把自己千丝万缕的感情一点点讲给她听，说她在他心中占有无比重要的位置，使她越听越珍惜他的爱。

他们不顾东南西北，只管朝前走。他们觉得有千言万语需要倾吐，有太多的事情需要思考和感受。所以没有心思欣赏周围的景物。伊丽莎白很快就意识到，他们之所以取得今天这样的谅解，还得感谢他的姨妈所作的努力。凯瑟琳夫人路过伦敦时果然去找过他，把她到浪搏恩的目的以及她和伊丽莎白的谈话内容全都告诉了他。她特意复述了伊丽莎白的每一句话，因为在她看来，这些尤其能反映伊丽莎白的狂妄任性。她以为经她这么一说，虽然伊丽莎白不肯放弃这门亲事，但她的外甥却会心灰意冷。可是，活该她老人家倒霉，那番话起到了完全相反的效果。

此刻只听达西对伊丽莎白说道：“以前我几乎不敢再存奢望，但我的姨妈却给了我信心。我了解你的性格，知道你要是仍对我深恶痛绝，而且毫无悔意，那你一定会坦率地向凯瑟琳夫人表明态度。”

伊丽莎白红了脸，一边笑一边说：“是的，你知道我是个爽快人，有话会直说的。当着你的面我都敢痛骂一场，在你的亲戚面前我就更没有什么顾忌的了。”

“你骂我的话，哪一句不是活该？你的指责虽然证据不足，判断有所偏颇，但就凭我当时对你的态度，也应该受到最严厉的谴责。那可真是不可饶恕的。回想起来，我就感到悔恨不已。”

伊丽莎白说：“那天晚上主要怪谁，咱们暂且不必争论。反正严格说来，双方的态度都有问题。但是，自从那以后，我觉得咱们都懂得了以礼相待。”

“我可不能这么轻易地原谅自己。几个月来，一想起我说过的那席话，我的行为、举止和态度，我就感到有一种说不出的痛苦。记得你对我说过：‘希望你能懂一点礼貌。’你的责难说得恰到好处，叫我终生铭心刻骨。你不知道，也想象不来，这句话对我造成了多么大的痛苦。不瞒你说，过了许久我才明白过来，觉得你的训导很有道理。”

“我万万没想到，我的话对你产生了那么深的影响。我一点也不知道，你在承受着那么大的痛苦。”

“这倒是不难相信。你当时一定觉得我不通情理。你变了脸色，声称我不管怎么花言巧语，你都不会接受我的求婚。那时的情景，我一辈子都忘不了。”

“嗨，那时的话就不必再提了。过去的事情就让它过去吧。老实讲，长期以来我一直在为自己的态度感到惭愧呢。”

接下来，达西又提起了他的那封信。他说：“看了信，你是不是立刻改变了对我的看法？信里的内容，你相信不相信？”

伊丽莎白解释了那封信对她所产生的影响，解释了她是怎样逐渐消除了偏见。

达西说：“我知道我的那封信会给你带来痛苦，但我也是不得已而为之呀。但愿你早已将信烧毁。信中有些话，尤其是开篇的那几句，我实在不愿让你再看第二眼。一些词句一定会让你对我恨之入骨。”

“如果你觉得非烧掉那封信才能确保我对你的爱，那我一定将它付之一炬。可话又说回来，我的感情就是再变幻莫测，也不会因为一封信就与你分道扬镳吧。”

达西说：“写信的时候，我自以为心情平静，态度镇定，可事后我才明白，我当时肚子里窝着一团怨气。”

“信的开头也许是含着一团怨气，可结尾却并非如此。最后的那句话完全是以慈悲为怀的[1]。不过，还是不要再去想那封信了。无论是写信的人，还是读信的人，现在的心情都和当初大不一样了。所以，应该把一切不愉快的事情全部忘掉。你得学学我的人生观——仅仅回忆给人以欢乐的往事。”

“我可不能把你的这种人生观付诸于实践。你回顾起往事，绝不会想起任何可以自责的地方，所以感到心安理得。这并非一种对人生的看法，更确切地说，应该是你对自己的过去问心无愧。可我的情况就不同了。我在思索问题的时候，难免会想起一些痛苦的往事。那些事情在我的心中根深蒂固，不可能被彻底抹去。我虽然不主张自私自利，但实际上我自私了一辈子。小的时候，大人只教我如何做人，却没有教会我完善自己的秉性。他们给我订了这样的信条那样的规矩，但在我奉行时却对我放任自流，纵容了我的傲慢和自大。不幸的是，我身为独生子（在长达数年的岁月里，我一直是家里唯一的孩子），被父母宠坏了。他们都是善良人（尤其是我的父亲，更是仁慈及和蔼），却纵容、怂恿，甚至教导我自私自利、高傲自大，除了自家人以外，不要关心任何人，看不起天下所有的人，至少要把他们看得不如我有见识、不如我高贵。从八岁到二十八岁。我一直是这样一个人，要不是遇上你，最亲爱、最可爱的伊丽莎白，我可能还是老样子！真是多亏你了！你给我上了一课，起初的确让我有点受不了，可是却使我受益匪浅。你对我的那顿羞辱，真是恰到好处。我当初来向你求婚，万万没想到会遭到你的拒绝。你使我明白了一个道理——用自命不凡的态度去取悦一个值得敬爱的姑娘，只会惨遭失败。”

“你当时真以为我会喜欢上你？”

“是这样的。你会笑我太自负吧？我当时以为你一定在指望和期待着我向你求婚呢。”

“那一定是因为我的言谈举止造成了误会，不过那绝不是故意做出来的。我从来就没想到要欺骗你，只是有时兴致一来，就做出了傻事。自从那天晚上起，你一定非常恨我吧？”

“怎么能恨你！起初也许我是有些生气，但过不多久，我便知道究竟应该恨谁了。”

“我真有些不敢问你，当初你在彭伯里见到我时，心里是怎么看待我的。你怪我不该到那儿去吧？”

“一点也不。我只是感到有些意外。”

“你不会比我更感到意外，因为我怎么也料不到你待我竟然那么好。我的良心告诉我，我不配受到特殊的礼遇。说句老实话。我根本没指望接受分外的款待。”

达西说：“我当时力求做到礼貌周全，以此向你表明我光明磊落，不计前嫌。我企图向你显示我已改正了你所指出的缺点，争取得到你的谅解，减轻你对我的偏见。具体什么时候又生出了其他的念头，实在难以奉告。不过我觉得那是在见到你约半小时后，才产生了些私心杂念。”

随后，他还告诉伊丽莎白说，乔治亚娜为能结识她感到非常高兴，后来她们的交往戛然而止，叫乔治亚娜觉得好不失望。当话题自然而然接触到那次突然的分别时，伊丽莎白方才明白了其中的原委。原来，达西在离开那家旅店之前，就已经下定了决心，要离开德比郡跟随她去寻找她的妹妹。他当时神情忧郁、心事重重，并不是为了别的缘故，而是在为那件事冥思苦想。

伊丽莎白又一次向他表示感谢。只因为这个话题太令人伤心，两人没有再深谈下去。

他们慢慢悠悠走了有好几英里的路程，由于忙着交流感情，竟然毫无察觉。最后看了看表，才发现早该回家了。

“宾利先生和简眼看就要大喜临门啦！”他们以此为话头，又谈起了那一对恋人的亲事。达西说，他的朋友早就把自己订婚的消息告诉了他，这件事令他喜不自胜。

“我要问问你，当时你是否感到十分意外？”伊丽莎白说。

“一点也不意外。我临走的时候，便觉得事情快有眉目了。”

“这么说，那是得到了你的允许。还真让我猜着了。”

尽管达西费尽了口舌进行分辩，可伊丽莎白仍觉得事实如此。

达西说：“去伦敦的头天晚上，我对他说了一些老早就应该挑明的话。我把自己横加干涉他的亲事的前因后果全盘端了出来，承认自己做得既荒唐又鲁莽。他听后大吃一惊，因为他从没想到会有这件事。我还说，我当初认为你的姐姐对他的感情无动于衷是一种错误的判断。我一眼便看得出，他对你姐姐的爱始终如一，所以坚信他们在一起一定能幸福美满。”

听到他如此轻而易举摆布他的那位朋友，伊丽莎白禁不住笑了。

“你对他说，我姐姐钟情于他，是你自己观察的结果，还是去年春天从我口中得知的？”

“是我自己观察到的。近来我两次造访贵府，仔细观察过你姐姐，发现她对宾利一往情深。”

“既然你都相信了，那么我想，宾利也立刻会相信的。”

“是的。宾利为人极其随和。他缺乏自信，遇到重大事情，自己拿不定主意。好在他对我言听计从，所以事情也就好办了。有一件事我不便相瞒，只好如实告诉了他。他听后顿时来了火，不过这的确也难怪他。我说你姐姐去年冬天在城里住了三个月，这事我当时知道，却故意瞒住了他。他当时生了一肚子气，可是一听说你姐姐真心爱他，便立刻气消怒释了。现在他已经完全原谅了我。”

伊丽莎白很想说，宾利先生真是个不可多得的宝贝朋友，这么容易让人牵着鼻子走，实在难能可贵。可是，她没有把这种话说出口。她意识到，现在就和达西开玩笑，显然为时过早。回家的路上，达西跟她滔滔不绝地说个不停，其中谈到了宾利的幸福（当然，这种幸福仅次于他自己的幸福）。进了家门之后，他们俩在走廊里分了手。

[1]达西原信的末尾一句怨气较重。伊丽莎白在这里只是和他打趣罢了。





第五十九章


伊丽莎白一走进闺房，简便问她：“亲爱的丽茨，你们散步散到哪儿去啦？”大家一道坐下来用餐时，也这样问她。她只好敷衍了两句，说他们在附近瞎转悠，后来连她自己也不知道溜达到了哪里。说话时，她的脸涨得通红。但就连她神态的变化，或者其他的因素，都没有使大家怀疑到那件好事上。

这一晚上过得平平静静，没有出现任何反常的现象，那一对已经公开了关系的恋人有说有笑，而尚未公开关系的恋人却默默无语，达西生性矜持，内心的喜悦从不外露；伊丽莎白心慌意乱，只知道自己获得了幸福，却品尝不到幸福的甘甜，这是因为除了眼前的处境异常窘迫外，她还面临着另外一些困难。她可以想象得到，她把消息一公开，家里人一定会感到骇然。她知道，这儿除了简，谁也不喜欢达西。光凭他的钱财和地位，恐难消除家里人对他的厌恶感。

到了夜里，她向简敞开了心扉。虽说简一向并不多疑，可这次却万万不相信妹妹的剖白。

“你开什么玩笑，丽茨。这简直是无稽之谈！你哪能和达西先生订婚！不，你休想骗我！我知道这是绝对不可能的。”

“瞧，一开始就出师不利！你是我唯一可信赖的人，如果连你都不肯信我的话，那就没有人会相信了。我可没有开玩笑的意思，所说的没有半句假话。他仍然爱着我，而且我们订婚了。”

简狐疑满腹地瞧了瞧她，说道：“算啦，丽茨！这不可能，因为我知道你十分讨厌他。”

“其实你对情况一点也不了解。你所说的都是历史了。以前也许我对他没有感情，可现在我的确爱他。对于这一类的恩恩怨怨，不应该耿耿于怀。从今往后，我要把这一切都忘个干干净净。”

伊丽莎白见姐姐仍然惊诧万状，于是又一次郑重其事地向她表明，自己讲的全是实话。

“老天爷！真有这事！现在我不得不相信了，”简嚷嚷道，“亲爱的丽茨，我可要……我可要恭喜你啦……可你敢肯定吗？请原谅我这样问你……你有十分把握，嫁给他会幸福吗？”

“这是无可置疑的。我们俩都认为，我们将会成为一对天底下最幸福的夫妻。可是，不知你满意不满意，简？你愿意要这样一个妹夫吗？”

“非常愿意。没有比这使我和宾利更感到高兴的事情了。我们私下里也曾考虑过和谈论过这事，只是觉得不可能。你真的非常爱他吗？我的好丽茨！你干什么都可以随便，只是没有爱情万万不可结婚。你确实感觉到你应该这样做吗？”

“是的，是的！等我把心里的话都告诉给你，你就会觉得我一往情深，不仅仅是应该做什么的问题了。”

“这话是什么意思？”

“嗨，我必须承认，我对他的爱超过了我对宾利的感情。听了这话，恐怕你会生气的。”

“最亲爱的妹妹，请你说点正经的。我跟你谈话，可是非常认真的。别耽误时间啦，凡是能让我知道的，请你统统讲给我听。是否请你告诉我，你爱上他有多长时间了？”

“我也弄不清有多长时间了，反正我的爱是慢慢滋生的。要是说起来，应该从我第一次参观他那美丽的彭伯里庄园时算起。”

姐姐又一次求她严肃些，这一次才算达到了目的。伊丽莎白立刻一本正经地给简讲述了她爱上达西的经过。做姐姐的现在对她的话深信不疑，心里感到非常满意。

她说：“你和我一样，一定会获得自己的幸福，想起来真让人感到高兴。我一向很看得起达西，暂且不说别的，就凭他爱你这一点，我也该始终如一地敬重他。现在他既是宾利的朋友，又将成为你的丈夫，所以，除了你和宾利之外，我最喜欢的就要算他了。不过，丽茨，你可真是个小滑头，在我面前一直守口如瓶。你只字未向我提起过你在彭伯里以及兰顿的那些遭遇！我所了解到的情况，全是听别人讲的，而不是你。”

伊丽莎白给她解释了自己为什么要保守秘密。她出于某种原因，一直不愿提起宾利；再者，她的感情尚未确定，因而也尽量避免谈到宾利那位朋友的名字。而现在，她不能再向姐姐隐瞒达西怎样为莉迪亚的婚事四处奔波的那段情节了。于是，她把所有的内情都端了出来，姐妹俩一直谈到半夜。

第二天早上，凭窗远眺的贝内特太太不由自主地叫出了声来：“天哪！那位达西先生真讨厌，又跟着亲爱的宾利跑到这里来了！他怎么这样不知趣，一个劲往咱家钻？我简直不明白他干嘛不去打打猎，或者干点别的事情，而偏偏要来扰乱咱们。怎么应付他才好呢？丽茨，你还得出去和他散步，免得他碍宾利的事。”

伊丽莎白一听这个建议，正中下怀，禁不住笑了起来。可是母亲老是贬低达西，这又让她气恼。

两位先生一走进门，宾利便意味深长地望了望她。并且热情洋溢地同她握手，一看便知他掌握了确切的情况。过了片刻。他提高嗓门大声说道：“贝内特太太，附近还有没有别的曲径小道，今天好让丽茨散步时再迷迷路？”

贝内特太太说：“我建议，达西先生、丽茨以及吉蒂今天上午一块到奥克姆山去。这段路虽然长了些，但沿途景色迷人，管保让达西先生大饱眼福。”

“对达西和丽茨来说，这简直再好不过了，”宾利在一旁说道，“可是我觉得吉蒂一定吃不消。是吧，吉蒂？”

吉蒂表明了态度，说她宁肯待在家中。达西声称他很想上山观风景，而伊丽莎白也默默地表示同意。她上楼做准备的时候，贝太太也跟了上去。只听贝太太解释道：

“硬让你一个人去应付那个讨厌鬼，实在让我感到难过，丽茨。希望你不要计较，因为你也知道，这全是为了简。你犯不着跟他多讲话，随便敷衍几句就行了。所以不必在他身上费心思。”

散步的时候，伊丽莎白和达西决定到了晚上就去征求贝内特先生的意见。伊丽莎白提出母亲那边由她去说。她有些六神无主，不知母亲会不会同意这门亲事。有时候她觉得，尽管达西有钱有势，但未必能使母亲消除对他的厌恶。还有，母亲对这桩婚姻无论是坚决反对也好，欣喜若狂也好，她的言谈举止反正都不会得体，都会惹得人家笑话她缺乏见识。伊丽莎白不愿意让达西去见母亲，去面对母亲欢天喜地的赞成或者气势汹汹的反对。

到了晚上，贝内特先生刚回到书房，达西便起身跟了进去。她看在眼里，急在心头。她并非担心父亲会持反对态度，而是害怕他会因此而感到不愉快。她暗忖，自己是父亲的掌上明珠，如果因为选择对象而给他老人家造成痛苦，使他为她的终身大事担忧、惋惜，未免太叫人于心不忍了。她满腹忧虑地坐在那里，直至达西满脸笑容地走了回来，心里才算松了一口气。过了一会儿，达西来到了她和吉蒂的桌子跟前，装着欣赏她手里的针线活，低声对她说道：“请到你父亲的书房去一趟，他找你有话说。”她听后，即刻到书房去了。

父亲正在那里来回踱步，样子既严肃，又关切。“丽茨，”他说道，“你搞的是什么名堂？你是不是疯啦，怎么接受了这个人的求婚？你不是一直都对他恨之入骨吗？”

她此刻真是后悔万分，怨自己当初的观点那么缺乏理智，怪自己说出的话不该那么辛辣尖刻。否则，她就用不着无比尴尬地解释和剖白了。眼下，看来只得多费些口舌了。于是，她神情慌乱地向父亲宣称，她爱上了达西先生。

“换句话说，你是打定了主意，非嫁给他不可了。他的确很富有，这样你可以比简有更多华丽的衣服和漂亮的马车。但这些能使你幸福吗？”

“您除了认为我对他缺乏感情，还有别的反对意见吗？”伊丽莎白问。

“没有了。我们都知道他性情高傲，是个不讨人喜欢的人。不过，如果你真心喜欢他，这也无关紧要。”

“我喜欢他，实实在在喜欢他，”伊丽莎白眼睛里滚动着泪花回答道，“我非常爱他。其实，他高傲得真是恰到好处。他简直可爱极啦。你们不了解他的真正为人。请您不要再用这样的语言谈论他，免得刺痛我的心。”

父亲说道：“丽茨，我已经答应了他的请求。像他这样身份的人，只要他不嫌弃，不管提什么样的要求我都不敢拒绝。如果你决计嫁给他，现在我也应允你。不过，我奉劝你再好好掂量一下。我了解你的个性，丽茨。我知道，除非你真心敬重自己的丈夫，觉得他高你一筹，否则你绝不会幸福，绝不会感到体面。你才能出众，如果婚姻不般配，一定会陷于危险的境地。那时你将很难逃脱耻辱感的纠缠，只落得悲惨的下场。我的孩子，日后可别因为你瞧不起自己的终身伴侣，让我见了为你伤心。你要清楚，这可非同儿戏呀。”

伊丽莎白越加激动起来，回话时显得异常恳切庄重。她一遍又一遍地重申，达西的确是她物色好的意中人，声称她对他的爱是逐步形成的。而达西对她的感情也决非一朝一夕的产物，而是经过了天长日久的考验。接着，她又激情满怀地列举了达西的优点，最后终于消除了父亲的顾虑，使他心悦诚服地同意了这门亲事。

待她把话讲完之后，父亲说道：“我的宝贝，别的话我也不再说了。倘若果真如此，他是配得上你的。我可不愿把你嫁给一个和你不相称的人。”

为了加深父亲对达西的好印象，伊丽莎白把达西主动解救莉迪亚的事情也说了出来。父亲听了，不由惊讶万分。

“这真是一个意外的事情层出不穷的晚上！想不到达西先生做了那么多好事！原来是他撮合了莉迪亚的婚事！是他慷慨解囊，为那个家伙偿还债务，还为他捐了官差！这真是再好不过了，既为我省去了一大堆麻烦，又为我省去了大笔的钱财。假如是你舅舅帮的忙，那我非得还他的情不可哩。深陷情网的年轻恋人，干起事情总是出乎人的意料。明天我一提出还他的钱，他肯定会一口拒绝，热烈渲染一番他对你的爱情。那时，还钱的事便会不了了之。”

此时，贝内特先生想起了几天之前，当他念柯林斯先生的来信时，二女儿的那副窘迫的表情。取笑了伊丽莎白一阵之后，他便打发她走了。待她走到房门口的时候，他又说道：“如果有小伙子来向玛丽或吉蒂求婚，就让他们进来，因为我正闲着呢。”

伊丽莎白心里的一块大石头，这才算落了地。她回到闺房闭门静思了半个小时，然后心情比较平稳地又来到了众人中间。一切事情都发生得太突然，她还来不及产生喜悦感。晚间的时光就这样子平安安过去了。现在已经没有什么大不了的事情令她担忧了。她的内心终究会产生一种安然自得、惬意舒畅的感觉。

入夜时分，母亲到梳妆室去了，她也跟了进去，并把这件重大的事情告诉了母亲。由此而产生的效果极不寻常。贝太太乍一听到这消息，呆若木鸡地坐在那里，一句话也说不出来。她老人家遇到对家里有益处的事情，或者遇到有人来向她的某个女儿表达爱情，反应通常是不迟钝的，可这次愣了好半天才听懂伊丽莎白的话。最后她终于恢复了常态，并有些坐不住了，于是便几次站起身来，不住地嘀咕、不住地祝福。

“老天爷呀！上帝保佑我！想想吧，好家伙！谁能料得到，竟是达西先生！这难道是真的吗？啊，我的心肝宝贝丽茨！你就要成为大富大贵的人啦！你将会有用不尽的银钱、珍贵的珠宝和华丽的马车！简相形之下就差远啦，简直可以说是天地之差。我真是太高兴了，太快活了。他是那样迷人，那样英俊、魁伟！唔，亲爱的丽茨！我以前那么慢待他，请代我向他赔个不是。但愿他不会和我计较。亲爱的丽茨啊，你在城里可以住上大房子啦！周围的一切都是那么辉煌，令人心醉！我有三个女儿嫁人啦！啧，每年一万镑的进项呵！啊，天哪！我太高兴了，简直都要发狂啦。”

这些话已足以证明，她完全赞成二女儿的婚事。伊丽莎白感到庆幸的是，母亲的一席得意忘形的言语，只有她一个人听见。过了不一会儿，她返身走了。可是她回到自己的闺房还不到三分钟，母亲就跟了来。

“我亲爱的宝贝，”母亲大声叫道，“我的脑子里想的全是这件事！每年一万镑的进项，还可能不只这些呢！阔得和皇帝老子一样！得申请一张特殊结婚证。你们应该持特殊结婚证办喜事。小宝贝，请你告诉我，达西先生最喜欢吃什么样的菜，好让我明天做给他品尝。”

这是个不祥之兆，看来母亲又要在那位先生面前出丑了。伊丽莎白心想，她虽然已百分之百地赢得了达西的一片爱心，并且征得了家里人的同意，但恐怕还会节外生枝。不过，第二天的情况比她预料的要好。幸亏贝太太对未来的女婿极其敬畏，不敢和他多活，只是尽自己的力量向他献献殷勤，恭维一下他的远见卓识。

伊丽莎白满意地看到，就连父亲也在竭力同达西套近乎。过了一会儿，父亲对她说，他越来越敬重达西了。

他这样评论道：“我非常器重我的三个女婿，威克姆大概要算最叫我得意的一个。不过我觉得，你丈夫和简的丈夫也都非常讨我喜爱。”





第六十章


伊丽莎白情绪一高涨，马上又变得顽皮起来。她要达西先生讲一讲爱上她的经过。“你的爱情是怎么萌发的？”她问道，“你自从迈出了第一步之后，便义无反顾地走了下去，这些我都知道。不过，最初你究竟是为了什么而爱上了我？”

“具体什么时间、什么地点，你的哪些神情或谈吐使我迷上了你，这些已经记不清了，因为那是很久以前的事了。等到我意识到自己爱上了你，已经到了不可自拔的程度。”

“一开始你就对我的容貌无动于衷；至于态度方面，我对你起码来说不是很有礼貌的，说起话来总是带刺，有意使你痛苦。请你说句老实话，你是不是爱我的唐突无礼？”

“我爱上你，是因为你思想活跃。”

“你还是称其为唐突吧，这样说一点也不过分。事实上，你从心底里厌恶繁文缛节、阿谀逢迎以及假装殷勤那一套。有些女人扭捏作态，言谈举止总想赢得你的欢心，其结果只会引起你的反感。正因为我跟她们截然不同，才打动了你的心，博得了你的青睐。假如你不是一个和蔼可亲的人，定会因此而对我怀恨在心。不过，尽管你想尽办法掩饰自己，而你的性格始终是正直的，情操始终是高尚的。你打心眼里鄙视那些拼命向你献媚的人。瞧，我都替你说了，省得你费口舌再作解释了。把所有的因素作一通盘考虑，我觉得你的选择是完全合理的。当然，你并不了解我具体有哪些优点，不过一个人要是坠入了情网，哪还顾得那许多。”

“当初简在尼瑟费德一病不起，而你对她体贴入微，这不正是你的优点吗？”

“简那么可亲可爱！见了她的人，谁不愿为她竭诚效力？那好吧，就权当这是我的一条优点吧。反正我的优点都是由你说的，爱怎么夸张就怎么夸张吧。不过我会进行报复的，一有机会就讽刺你，和你争长论短。我说干就干，现在就想请你回答：为什么你迟迟不愿接触实质性的问题？你第一次来访以及后来在这儿吃饭时，为什么老躲着我？尤其是你造访寒舍的那一次，为什么摆出那种神气，好像根本不把我放在眼里？”

“因为你那时一本正经、默默无语，叫我敬而远之。”

“那是因为我觉得不好意思呀。”

“我也一样。”

“你来吃饭的那一次，完全可以跟我多说几句话嘛。”

“要是爱你爱得不深，我的话也许会多一些。”

“真有你的！你的回答无懈可击，而我偏偏又通情达理，所以只好相信你啦！不过，要是由着你自己的性子，你不知要把心里的话憋到何年何月呢。如果不是我问你，恐怕你一辈子也不肯讲出来！为了莉迪亚的事情，我对你千恩万谢，这一点肯定是促成这桩亲事的巨大动力。可是，我觉得那样做太过分了。由于别人违背了一个誓言，咱们才有了今天的幸福，这在情理上又怎么说得通呢？我真不该提那件事，千不该万不该呀！”

“你用不着难过。这在情理上完全讲得通。凯瑟琳夫人蛮横无理地企图拆散咱们，结果弄巧成拙，反而有助于澄清我心中的种种疑团。并非由于你当时对我说了几句感激的话，我才有了今天的幸福。我那时可没有心思等着你先开口。我姨妈提供的情况已经给我带来了希望，所以我是抱着坚定的决心来这儿的，非把事情弄个水落石出不可。”

“凯瑟琳夫人在这上面帮了一个大忙。她应该为此而感到高兴，因为她以助人为乐趣。不过请你告诉我，你为什么要到尼瑟费德来？难道仅仅是为了来尼瑟费德遛遛马，品尝一下尴尬的滋味？或者说，你有比较重要的目的吧？”

“我的真正目的是来看看你。如有可能的话，我想观察一下，是否有希望使你钟情于我。不过，我对别人及至对自己，都说是为了来了解一下你姐姐对宾利是否仍有情意，如果仍然有情，就向宾利认错，这一点我已经做到了。”

“你有没有勇气向凯瑟琳夫人宣布咱们订婚的消息？”

“我倒不是缺乏勇气，而是没有时间，伊丽莎白。不过，这事早晚都得做。你能给我找一页纸来，我立刻就写信。”

“我也有一封信要写，不然我可以守在你身旁，像那位年轻小姐一样，欣赏你流畅的文笔。可惜我有位舅妈呢，不能再让她蒙在鼓里了。”

且说加德纳太太在上次来的那封长信中，过高地估计了伊丽莎白和达西的关系，而伊丽莎白一直不愿把实情告诉她，故而没有回信。而现在大喜临门，把这消息告诉她，一定会让她喜出望外。但伊丽莎白回想起来有些惭愧，因为整整晚了三天才让舅父舅妈知道这条喜讯。她觉得事不宜迟，即刻操笔写道：


亲爱的舅妈：

承蒙您一片好心，给我写来长信讲述了事情的详情细节。我原本应该回信致谢，但实在因为我心里怒气太盛，一直没有动笔。您当时的猜想有些言过其实。可现在，您爱怎么想就怎么想吧。让您的思想插上翅膀凌空飞翔吧，只要您不说我已经结了婚，就不会有大的出入。您应该马上再写一封信来，把他好好赞扬赞扬，而且这支颂歌要唱得比上一次更加动听。我真应多谢您没带我到湖区去。我那时简直愚蠢极了，怎么渴望着到那儿去！您说要驾着小马游览彭伯里庄园，这可是个绝妙的主意。咱们将来天天都可以在庄园里东游西荡。我现在成了天底下最幸福的女人。也许其他人也说过这样的话，但谁也不像我这样名副其实。我甚至比简还要幸福：她只是莞尔微笑，而我却敞怀大笑。在此，达西分出一部分爱我之心，向您表示问候。欢迎你们全家来彭伯里过圣诞节。

您的外甥女



达西写给凯瑟琳夫人的信，风格与这封迥然不同。而贝内特先生给柯林斯写的回信，笔调又完全是另外一种样子。


亲爱的先生：

我必须再次劳你大驾向我贺喜。伊丽莎白马上就要成为达西太太了。请你好好安慰一下凯瑟琳夫人。另外，我要是你的话，就一定站到她的外甥一边，因为他可以给你更大的利益。

祝您好运



宾利小姐祝贺哥哥即将结婚成家，甜言蜜语了一番，但却缺乏诚意。她甚至给简写了一封信，表达了她的喜悦心情，同时又故伎重演，假惺惺地强调了她的一片爱心。简没有上当受骗，可免不了受了些感动。她并不信赖宾利小姐，却还是回了她一封信，措辞极其亲切，可真是让对方受之有愧。

达西小姐来信说明，她在接到哥哥发来的喜讯时，心里和哥哥一样感到由衷的高兴。她写了满满四页纸还觉得言犹未尽，没有表达清楚内心的喜悦，以及她是怎样渴望未来的嫂嫂和她相亲相爱。

柯林斯没有写来回信，他的妻子也没有向伊丽莎白发来贺辞，而浪搏恩一家却风闻柯林斯两口子已经到了卢卡斯府上。他们之所以不期而至，其原因很快明朗了。原来，凯瑟琳夫人在接到外甥的信后，顿时勃然大怒。夏洛特虽为朋友的婚事真心感到高兴，但不得不躲出家门，等着她怒息气消。伊丽莎白见朋友在这种关头前来助兴，不由欣喜万分。但她们相会了几次，她便发现这种快乐是由高昂的代价换来的。她亲眼看到了夏洛特的丈夫曲尽其能，向达西摇尾乞怜、百般献媚。达西真是了不起，竟然能坦然自若地忍受他的絮叨。他甚至还能体体面面、不动声色地听威廉·卢卡斯爵士说恭维话。后者说他摘取了当地最瑰丽的明珠，最后还希望他们能在王宫里常常见面。直到威廉爵士走开之后，他才耸了耸肩膀。

还有菲利普斯太太，她为人粗俗，也许叫达西更难以忍受。好在她像她的姐姐一样，对达西过于敬畏，故而不敢多话，不似在和蔼可亲的宾利面前可以谈笑风生。不过，她一旦张口，便让人觉得俗不可耐。她由于对达西感到敬畏才少言寡语，但并未因此而变得文雅起来。伊丽莎白总是设法把达西从她们两姐妹身边弄开，免得看她们出丑，看她们不时地向他献殷勤。她拿出全副精力与达西交谈，并且只让他接触不会令他难堪的家庭成员。这样的应酬叫她心里很不是滋味，大大减少了恋爱的乐趣，但同时也让她更加憧憬未来。她一想到未来便感到高兴，期望着摆脱眼前这些讨厌的人，到彭伯里去享受温馨、优雅的小日子。





第六十一章


两个最有出息的女儿出嫁的那天，贝内特太太作为母亲，心里简直快活到了极点。操办完婚事之后，她喜气洋洋地去看望宾利太太，并跟人家谈论达西太太，那种得意的心情是可想而知的。说到这里，看在她一家人的情分上，我倒想顺便提一句：由于她实现了自己最大的心愿，为这么多的女儿找到了归宿，她自己也发生了可喜的变化。在她的残生余年里，她居然变得通情达理又和颜悦色，而且也有了见识。不过她时而还有些神经质，且始终笨头笨脑。这也许成了她丈夫的一种福分，否则他就享受不到这异乎寻常的天伦之乐了。

贝内特先生非常惦念二女儿。他无事很少出门，只因疼爱伊丽莎白，便经常跑去看望她。他喜欢到彭伯里去，而且专爱拣别人意料不到的时候。

宾利先生和简在尼瑟费德只住了一年。尽管宾利性情随和，而简富于仁爱之心，但守在母亲以及麦里屯那些亲戚的身旁，心里总觉得不美。于是，宾利在邻近德比郡的一个地区置了幢房子，这也算满足了他的姐姐及妹妹的殷切愿望。同时，这对简和伊丽莎白也是件喜事，因为她们姐妹俩现在相距还不足三十英里呢。

吉蒂把大部分时间都泡在两个姐姐家里，并从中受益匪浅。比起以前的老相识来说，她现在周围的人都具有无比高尚的情操，这使她有了不小的长进。她的本性并不是像莉迪亚那样放荡不羁，况且又摆脱了莉迪亚的影响，再加上妥善的关照和严格的约束，她也就不似从前那般易怒、无知和死气沉沉了。当然，家里人仍谨小慎微地监视着她，不让她再受莉迪亚的不良影响。那位威克姆太太三番五次地请她去住一段时间，答应带她参加舞会、结识年轻的小伙子，可父亲却怎么也不肯放她走。

守在家里的只有玛丽这么一个女儿了。贝太太不甘寂寞，自然要拉她做伴，故搅得她无法潜心做学问。玛丽迫于无奈，只好忙于应酬，不过每天上午接待过客人之后，她都要搬出道德标准对来人品头论足。她再也不用为自己长得不如姐姐们美丽而自惭形秽了。父亲狐疑满腹，觉得她对家里所发生的变化有些沾沾自喜。

至于威克姆和莉迪亚，他们的性格并未因为姐姐们出嫁而有所变化。威克姆心想，伊丽莎白原来不太了解他，不知道他所干下的那些恩将仇报、坑蒙拐骗的勾当，而现在八成已对他了如指掌，可尽管如此，他仍然表现得异常镇定，还指望着达西给他施舍呢。伊丽莎白结婚时接到莉迪亚的一封贺信，从信中可以看出，即便威克姆本人没抱这种指望，至少莉迪亚也有这个意思。那封信的内容如下：


亲爱的丽茨：

祝你万事如意。要是你对达西先生的感情能抵得上我对亲爱的威克姆的一半爱，那你一定会非常幸福。你现在富比王侯，真叫人不胜欣慰。希望你在闲着无事的时候，能够多想想我们。威克姆十分想在宫廷里谋份差事。我觉得，要是不靠外人周济，我们手里的钱恐怕连糊口也不够了。不管什么差事都可以，每年只要有三四百镑的收入就行了。此事你如若不愿告诉达西先生，那就不必提起。

你的妹妹



伊丽莎白果然不想打搅达西，便私下写了封回信，奉劝妹妹别再提这种要求，别再抱这种念头。不过，她还是从自己的花销中节省出一些钱来，经常寄去接济他们俩。她早就看得得一清二楚，他们夫妇虽然挣钱不多，却挥霍无度，一点也不为将来考虑，到头来只会落得手头拮据、缺吃少穿。那两口子每次搬家，总要伸手向简或伊丽莎白要钱，让她们帮着付账还债。即便在和平时期来到时，他们退了伍，也不愿过安适日子，总是东跑西颠。他们四处寻找廉价房子住。结果老是多花许多没必要的钱。威克姆不久便情淡爱弛。莉迪亚的感情稍微持久一些，因为她虽然既年轻又放荡，但她毕竟还顾及这桩婚姻使她有了一些名分。

达西虽然始终不准威克姆到彭伯里来，但是看在伊丽莎白的面上，仍旧帮他寻找差事干。莉迪亚趁丈夫到伦敦或巴思寻欢作乐时，倒是常来这儿做客。这两口子老是朝宾利家跑，而且一住就是许多时日。就连性情随和的宾利也感到厌烦了，甚至提到要赶他们走。

宾利小姐见达西结了婚，心里感到非常难过，可是，她出于想继续保持到彭伯里做客的权利，便打消了满腹的怨恨，她比以前更喜爱乔治亚娜，对达西仍是那样殷勤，并把以前对伊丽莎白的失礼之处一一补偿。

彭伯里现在成了乔治亚娜的家。姑嫂之间情投意合，正像达西先前所期望的那样。她们相敬如宾，心心相印。天底下，乔治亚娜最看重的就是伊丽莎白了。不过，最初她听见伊丽莎白以活泼顽皮的口吻同哥哥讲话时，心里感到万分惊讶，甚至觉得恐慌。她一向敬重哥哥，这种情感几乎超过了她对哥哥的爱。而现在，她发现哥哥居然成了别人公开打趣的对象，从中她了解到了一些前所未闻的知识。经过伊丽莎白的诱导，她开始懂得：妻子可以在丈夫面前任意撒娇，而并非所有的哥哥都允许比自己小十岁的妹妹随心所欲。

凯瑟琳夫人听到外甥结婚的消息，感到怒不可遏。外甥来信向她报喜，她却原形毕露，咬牙切齿地写了封回信把他痛骂一顿，尤其把伊丽莎白更是骂得狗血喷头。于是，双方一度中断了交往。后来还是伊丽莎白顾全大局，劝说丈夫化干戈为玉帛，争取和解。做姨妈的先是强拗了一阵，后来心里的怨恨便冰消雪融了。这也许是因为她疼爱外甥的缘故，或者是由于她十分想亲眼瞧瞧外甥媳妇懂不懂礼仪。于是，她顾不得外甥家添了一位这样的主妇，顾不得那位主妇的舅父舅妈常从城里赶来搅扰，以至于把庄园里的小树林弄得乌烟瘴气，特意屈尊俯就地来到彭伯里探望新婚夫妇。

无论是达西，还是伊丽莎白，都一直同加德纳夫妇保持着亲密无间的关系，并真心地爱他们。小两口对他们的恩情刻骨铭心，因为正是由于他们把伊丽莎白带到了德比郡来，才使达西和伊丽莎白的命运联结在了一起。
