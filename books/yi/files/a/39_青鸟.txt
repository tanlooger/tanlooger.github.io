第一章　樵夫的小屋


从前，有一个樵夫，他和他的妻子住在一个小木屋里，那个木屋位于一片广袤而古老的森林边上。他们有两个可爱的孩子，这两个孩子经历了一场非常不可思议的历险。

但是讲述这段历险故事之前，我必须描述一下这两个孩子，以便你们了解他们的性格，因为他们如果不是那么可爱、勇敢和坚定，那么接下来你们要听到的这个奇妙的故事便根本不会发生。

泰泰尔——这是我们的主人公的名字——今年十岁，他的小妹妹麦泰尔只有六岁。

泰泰尔是一个样貌好看、个子高挑的小家伙，他身体壮实，黑色的头发卷卷的，经常乱成一团，因为他很喜欢嬉笑打闹。大家都很喜欢他，他的脸上总是挂着十分和气的笑容，眼睛中闪耀着明亮的光。而他最大的优点，就是他行事如同一个勇敢无畏的小大人，展示出了他高贵的内心。清晨时分，当他和父亲樵夫泰尔一起走在林中的小路上时，尽管身穿褴褛的旧衣，他看起来依然非常骄傲，带着一种庄严的气质，仿佛大地上和天空中所有美丽的事物都在等候他，在他经过的时候对他微笑。

他的小妹妹则非常不同，看上去特别甜美可爱，她穿着长裙，尽管上面打了很多补丁，不过泰尔太太将补丁缝得非常干净整齐。虽然她哥哥的头发乌黑，但是她的头发颜色却很浅，她那透着羞怯的大眼睛湛蓝湛蓝的，就如同田野中的勿忘我。任何事情都会吓到她，她可能因为任何一件小事情哭出来。但是她稚嫩的灵魂中已经具备了女性最高贵的品质——她极富爱心，性情温柔，全身心地爱着她的哥哥，不愿离开哥哥，所以便毫不犹豫地与哥哥一起踏上了漫长而危险的旅程。

我们的故事要说的，就是我们的两个小主人公为什么会在一个晚上出发去寻找幸福，一路上又发生了什么。

泰尔爸爸的小屋是乡下最破的，这房子看起来格外凄凉，因为对面是一座富丽堂皇的大房子，里面住着有钱人家的孩子们。当傍晚大房子的餐厅和客厅灯亮起来的时候，你就能透过小屋的窗户看到大房子里面的情形。而白天，你可以看到小孩们在露台、花园和暖房中玩耍。暖房里一年四季都长满了奇花异草，经常有城里的人来这里参观。

有一个晚上和其他的夜晚不太一样，因为这是圣诞节前夜，泰尔妈妈把孩子们安顿到床上，带着比平常更多的爱意亲吻了他们。她有点儿伤心，由于暴风雪，泰尔爸爸没能去森林中干活，因此她没有钱买礼物装进泰泰尔和麦泰尔的长筒袜里。孩子们很快就进入了梦乡，万籁俱寂，一片安然，除了猫的咕噜声、狗的呼噜声和祖父留下的钟的嘀嗒声，便再也听不到别的声音了。但突然间，一道像白昼一样明亮的光透过百叶窗照了进来，桌子上的灯自己又亮了起来，床上的两个孩子醒了，打着哈欠，揉着眼睛，伸展着胳膊。泰泰尔用小心谨慎的声音叫道：

“麦泰尔？”

“嗯，泰泰尔？”他的妹妹回答。

“你睡着了吗？”

“你呢？”

“没有。”泰泰尔说，“我怎么会睡着呢，我正和你说话呢。”

“我说，现在是圣诞节了吗？”妹妹问。

“还没到。明天才是圣诞节。不过今年圣诞老人不会给我们带任何礼物了。”

“为什么不会呢？”

“我听妈妈说，她没办法到城里去告诉圣诞老人。但是他明年会来的。”

“明年远吗？”

“还要过很久。”泰泰尔说，“但他今晚会去看那些有钱的孩子。”

“真的吗？”

“嘿！”突然间泰泰尔叫道，“妈妈忘了熄灯了！……我有了一个主意。”

“什么主意？”

“咱们起床吧。”

“但咱们不能起床呀。”麦泰尔说，她总是很听话。

“哎呀，周围没有人！……你看到百叶窗那边了吗？”

“啊，真亮啊！”

“那是派对的灯光。”泰泰尔说。

“什么派对？”

“对面有钱的孩子的派对。那是圣诞树。咱们把百叶窗打开吧……”

“咱们可以打开吗？”麦泰尔胆怯地问。

“当然可以。没有人拦着我们……你听到音乐声了吗？咱们起床吧。”

于是两个孩子跳下床，跑到窗户边，爬上窗边的小凳子，拉开了百叶窗。一片明亮的光填满了整个房间，孩子们充满期待地看着外面。

“一切都看得清清楚楚呢！”泰泰尔说。

“我看不到。”可怜的小麦泰尔说，凳子上几乎没有她落脚的地方了。

“下雪了。”泰泰尔说，“那里有两辆马车，每辆车都有六匹马拉着。”

“有十二个男孩从车里出来了！”麦泰尔说，她努力踮着脚向窗外看。

“别说傻话了！……那些是小女孩……”

“可他们都穿着灯笼裤啊……”

“安静！看着！”

“那些金色的东西是什么？就是挂在树枝上的那些？”

“哎呀，是玩具啊，肯定的！”泰泰尔说，“宝剑、手枪、士兵、大炮……”

“那些呢，桌子上摆的那些呢？”

“蛋糕、水果、奶油馅饼。”

“啊，那些孩子多漂亮啊！”麦泰尔拍着手说。

“他们一直在笑呢，笑得多开心啊！”泰泰尔答道。

“那些小孩儿在跳舞！……”

“是啊，是啊，咱们也跳吧！”泰泰尔说。

两个孩子开心地在凳子上跺着脚。

“哦，真好玩！”麦泰尔说。

“他们去拿蛋糕了！”泰泰尔叫道，“他们拿起蛋糕了！……他们开始吃了，他们吃了，他们吃了！……哦，多可爱的蛋糕，太可爱了！……”

麦泰尔开始数着想象中的蛋糕。

“我有十二个！……”

“我有四个十二个！”泰泰尔说，“不过我会分给你一些的……”

我们的两个小朋友又跳又笑，开心地尖叫着，沉浸在其他孩子的喜悦里，而忘了自己的贫穷和匮乏。他们很快就会得到奖励的。突然之间，响起了重重的敲门声。两个孩子一惊，停止嬉闹，一动也不敢动。然后，大大的木头门闩自己抬了起来，“吱嘎”一声，门缓缓地打开了，一个小个子老妇人走进来，她穿着一身绿色的衣服，头戴一顶红兜帽，背是驼的，脚是跛的，她只有一只眼睛，鼻子几乎要碰到下巴，还拄着一根拐杖。她肯定是一位仙女。

她蹒跚着走向孩子们，用带着鼻音的声音问道：

“你们有会唱歌的草和青色的鸟儿吗？”

“我们有一些草，”泰泰尔浑身颤抖着回答，“但是那些草不会唱歌……”

“泰泰尔有一只鸟儿。”麦泰尔说。

“但是我不能把它送人，因为它是我的。”小家伙飞快地补充道。

这难道不是最充足的理由吗？

仙女戴上她那大大的圆眼镜，仔细地看了看那只鸟儿。

“这只颜色不够青。”她说，“我需要的是完全青色的鸟儿。这是为了我的小女儿，她病得很厉害……你们知道青鸟代表什么吗？不知道？我想你们也不知道。不过因为你们是好孩子，所以我会告诉你们的。”

仙女抬起弯曲的手指，放在长长的尖鼻子边，用一种神秘的声音低声说：

“青鸟代表着幸福。我希望你们能够明白，我的小女儿必须得到幸福，才能好起来。因此，我命令你们出发去探索世界，为她寻找青鸟。你们要立刻出发……你们知道我是谁吗？”

孩子们困惑地看了看彼此。实际上，他们过去从来都没有见过仙女，因此有点儿害怕她。不过，泰泰尔很快便礼貌地回答：

“你很像我们的邻居，柏林格特太太……”

泰泰尔觉得这么说是对这位仙女的恭维，因为柏林格特太太的店——就在他们小屋的隔壁——是一个令人非常愉快的地方。里面装满了糖果、弹珠、巧克力雪茄、糖娃娃、糖母鸡。每到集市的时候，那里会有裹着金箔纸的大姜饼娃娃。柏林格特太太的鼻子就像仙女的一样丑，她的年纪也很大了。另外，她也像仙女一样，走路的时候驼背弯腰。但是她非常和气，她还有一个可爱的小女儿，过去总在星期天和樵夫家的孩子们一块玩。不幸的是，那个可怜的金黄头发的漂亮小东西总是承受着某种不知名的病痛，因此她不得不经常待在床上。每次卧床的时候，她就会乞求能和泰泰尔的鸽子一起玩耍，但是泰泰尔太喜欢那只鸟儿了，不愿意给她。小男孩觉得，这一切都和仙女告诉他的事情很像，所以他觉得仙女像柏林格特太太。

令他惊讶的是，仙女勃然大怒，脸涨得通红。她喜欢与众不同，因为她是一个仙女，可以变换自己的容貌，只要她愿意，随时都可以。那天晚上，她碰巧是一个丑陋的驼背老太太，失去了一只眼睛，两小绺灰色的头发垂在肩膀上。

“我看起来是什么样子？”她问泰泰尔，“我是漂亮还是丑陋？苍老还是年轻？”

她问这些问题是为了考验小男孩是否善良。但小男孩扭开头，不敢说出自己对她的外貌的看法。然后，她喊道：

“我是仙女贝丽露娜！”

“哦，那太好了。”泰泰尔回答，此时他浑身都在发抖。

这回答让仙女很满意。孩子们都还穿着睡衣，她告诉他们换衣服。她一边亲自动手帮麦泰尔换衣服，一边问：

“你们的爸爸妈妈呢？”

“在那里。”泰泰尔指着右边的门，“他们在睡觉。”

“你们的爷爷奶奶呢？”

“他们死了……”

“你们的弟弟妹妹……你们有弟弟妹妹吗？”

“哦，有的，三个小弟弟！”泰泰尔说。

“还有四个小妹妹。”麦泰尔补充。

“他们在哪儿？”仙女问。

“他们也死了。”泰泰尔回答。

“你们还想再见到他们吗？”

“噢，想！……一次就行！……让我们看看他们！……”

“我可没有把他们装在我的口袋里。”仙女说，“不过很幸运，在你们经过回忆之地的时候就可以见到他们了。那里在去寻找青鸟的路上，经过第三个岔路口向左拐……我敲门的时候你们在做什么？”

“我们在玩‘吃蛋糕’。”泰泰尔说。

“你们有蛋糕吗？……蛋糕在哪儿？……”

“在那些有钱孩子的房子里……过来看，非常可爱呢！”

泰泰尔拉着仙女到窗边去。

“可是吃蛋糕的是别人啊！”她说。

“是的，但是我们能看着他们吃啊。”泰泰尔说。

“你们不生他们的气吗？”

“为什么要生他们的气？”

“因为他们吃了所有的蛋糕。我觉得他们一点儿都不给你们，这非常不对。”

“一点儿也不生气。他们有钱！……啊，那边真漂亮啊！”

“这里也同样漂亮，只是你看不到……”

“我能看见。”泰泰尔说，“我的眼神非常好。我能看到教堂钟楼上的时间，爸爸就看不到！”

仙女突然生起气来。

“我跟你说了你看不见！”她说。

她越来越生气。好像能不能看到教堂钟楼上的时间是件至关重要的事儿。

当然，小男孩并不瞎，但他是个善良的孩子，理应开心快乐，仙女希望能教他看到万物内在的美好。这并不是简单的事情，因为她很清楚，大多数的人，无论生还是死，都没有享受过就在他们周围的快乐。不过，因为她是一个仙女，她是万能的，所以，她决定给泰泰尔一顶有颗魔法钻石的小帽子，这颗魔法钻石拥有一种特别的魔力，可以永远向他展示出真相，能够帮助他看到万物的内在，从而教会他，万物都有各自的生命，是独特的存在，被创造出来与我们的生命和存在相配，会令我们更快乐。

仙女从挂在身侧的一个大包中拿出了一顶小帽子。这帽子是绿色的，上面有一个白色的帽章，中间闪耀着一颗大大的钻石。泰泰尔十分高兴。仙女给他讲解了那颗钻石如何使用：按一下钻石，你就可以看到事物的灵魂，如果把它往右转一转，你就会发现过去，把它转向左边，你就会看到未来。

泰泰尔的脸上神采奕奕，他开心地手舞足蹈。然后，他立刻又开始担心会失去这顶小帽子。

“爸爸会把它从我这里拿走的！”他喊道。

“不会的，”仙女说，“因为只要你把它戴到头上，就没人能看到它……你想试试吗？”

“好啊，好啊！”孩子们拍着手叫道。

那帽子一戴到小男孩的头上，一切都发生了神奇的变化。老仙女变成了一个年轻漂亮的公主，穿着丝绸的衣服，戴着闪闪发光的珠宝，小屋的墙壁变得透明，就像珍贵的宝石一样熠熠发光，简陋的松木家具就像大理石一样闪着光泽。两个孩子跑来跑去，拍着手，快乐地叫着。

“啊，真可爱，真可爱！”泰泰尔叫道。

而麦泰尔，天生是个爱美的小东西，看到仙女公主美丽的衣裙，像是着迷了一样呆住了。

不过，还有更多更大的惊喜在等着他们。仙女不是说过吗，所有物品，所有动物，都会活过来，就像人一样说话行动？看啊，看啊，祖父那个老钟表的门突然间就打开了，寂静被最甜美的音乐填充，十二个穿着优雅、笑容灿烂的小小舞者开始围着孩子们跳跃旋转。

“这是你们生命中的时间。”仙女说。

“我能和她们一起跳舞吗？”泰泰尔说，他羡慕地望着这些美丽的生灵，她们就像小鸟一样在地板上跳跃飞腾。

但就在这时，他爆发出一阵大笑。有个好笑的胖家伙，胖得都喘不过气来，浑身挂着面粉，挣扎着从面包烤盘里爬出来向孩子们鞠躬。这是谁啊？这是面包！面包趁现在能够自由，出来到地上溜达一下！他看上去像个矮胖而滑稽的老先生。他的脸是鼓胀的面团，在粗壮的胳膊末端是一双大手，两只手放在圆滚滚的大肚子上时，根本没办法握在一起。他穿着一件紧身的面包皮色的衣服，胸前有些条纹，就像我们当作早餐的漂亮的黄油面包卷一样。他的头上——想想看吧——他顶着一个巨大的圆面包，就像是戴着一条滑稽的头巾。

他刚跌跌撞撞地从烤盘里出来，这时就有别的和他一样的面包——不过更小一些——跟在他后面，和时间们一起跳舞，完全不在乎他们抖落到那些漂亮小姐身上的面粉，把她们包裹在一大片白色的云雾里。

这是一个奇怪而迷人的舞会。孩子们十分开心。时间们和面包们跳着华尔兹，盘子们也加入了其中，在厨具柜上冒着掉下去摔得粉碎的危险上蹿下跳，橱柜里的玻璃杯彼此相碰，祝愿所有人都身体健康。至于叉子，他们和餐刀聊个没完，嗓门很大，大到你都听不到自己的声音了……

如果这喧闹持续的时间更长一些的话，谁也不知道会发生什么。泰尔爸爸和泰尔妈妈肯定会被吵醒。幸好，当这场嬉闹到达高潮的时候，一团巨大的火焰从灯罩中跳了出来，令整个房间闪耀着明亮的红光，就像是整个房子着了火一样。所有人都惊慌地躲到了墙角，而泰泰尔和麦泰尔则害怕地抽泣着，把头藏到了好仙女的斗篷下面。

“别害怕，”她说，“这只是火而已，他是来和你们一起玩的。他是个好人，但你们最好不要碰他，因为他是个暴脾气。”

孩子们透过仙女斗篷上漂亮的金色蕾丝边紧张地往外看，看到了一个红色的高个子也正看着他们，在笑话他们的胆小呢。他穿着猩红色的紧身衣，上面缀满了亮片。当他挥动长胳膊的时候，肩膀上垂下来的丝绸披肩就像火焰一样。他的头发在头上一缕缕地直竖着，发着亮光。他甩着双臂和双腿，就像个疯子一样在房间中跳来跳去。

泰泰尔尽管感觉稍微放松了一些，不过仍然不敢离开自己的庇护所。这时，仙女贝丽露娜有了一个极好的主意，她用她的魔棒指了指水龙头，立刻，出现了一个年轻女孩，她不停哭泣，就像不会枯竭的喷泉一样。这是水。她非常漂亮，但是她的样子悲伤极了。她唱着歌，声音柔美，如同泉水的叮咚声。她长长的头发一直垂到脚面，也许是用海藻做的。她身上只穿着睡袍，但身上流淌着的水仿佛衣服一样裹着她，泛着盈盈的光。她起初有些犹豫，然后环顾四周，看到还在像个无法自控的疯子一样乱转的火，便恼怒而气愤地扑向了他，向他的脸上喷水，用尽全力将他弄湿。火暴跳如雷，开始冒烟。不过，他突然发现向自己发难的是他的宿敌，就觉得还是躲到角落里比较明智。水也撤到了一边，一切似乎又归于平静。

两个孩子终于从惊恐中恢复过来，问仙女接下来会发生什么。就在这时，陶罐碎裂的声音把大家吓了一跳，他们转头看向桌子那里。真是让人惊讶啊！地板上的牛奶罐碎成了无数片，从碎片中站起一位迷人的女子，她惊恐地低叫了几声，紧握着双手，抬起充满恳求的双眼。

泰泰尔赶忙上前去安慰她，因为他立刻就认出她是牛奶。他非常喜欢她，给了她一个善意的吻。她就像一个挤奶小女工一样清新美丽，覆盖着奶油的白色裙子散发着一股香甜的干草气味。

这个时候，麦泰尔正看着糖块，他似乎也要活过来了。糖块在门旁边的一个架子上，裹在蓝色糖纸中，他不断地晃来晃去，左摇右摆，但没有任何用处。最后，一条长长细细的胳膊伸了出来，然后是一个尖脑袋撑破纸钻了出来，再然后是另一条胳膊和两条长到没边儿的腿。哎呀，你们真应该看看糖先生有多好笑，非常好笑，真的，孩子们看到他的脸，就都情不自禁地大笑起来。不过，他们都很愿意友好待他，因为他们听到仙女这么介绍他：

“泰泰尔，这是糖的灵魂。他的口袋里面装满了糖，他的手指都是糖棍儿。”

有一位由糖做成的朋友是多好的事啊，只要你想吃糖了，就可以从他身上咬下一块。

“汪，汪，汪！早上好，早上好，我的小上帝！……我们终于，终于可以交谈了。尽管以前我可以叫或是摇动尾巴，但你们从来都不懂我的意思！……我爱你们！我爱你们！”

这个独特的人是谁啊？这个围着所有人打转，让整个屋子充满了他欢乐的喧闹声的人是谁啊？我们一眼就认出了他。这是泰罗，一只善良的狗，全心全意地想理解人类，他是陪着孩子们去森林的天性善良的动物，是守护大门的忠诚护卫，是永远真诚忠实的可靠朋友。他用两只后腿走过来——这两只腿显得有些太短了，两只前腿举在空中挥来舞去，像是一个笨拙的小人儿一样比画着。他一点儿都没有变，依然有着光滑的芥末色皮毛，喜气洋洋的斗牛犬的脑袋，顶着黑色的鼻子，但是他比原来大了很多，而且会说话了！他说得飞快，好像是想抓紧时间为自己的种群平反，他们已经沉默了好几百年了。他什么话题都想说一说，因为他终于能说话了。他吻了他的小主人们，叫他们“我的小上帝”，这情景真是太感人了。他一会儿坐下，一会儿又跳起来满屋子跑，弄翻家具，用他柔软的大爪子扑倒了麦泰尔，伸舌头，摇尾巴，呼哧呼哧地喘着粗气，就像在外面打猎一样。我们一下子就看出他生性淳朴而慷慨。他深信自己的重要性，觉得自己可是这个新世界当中必不可少的一分子呢。

在两个孩子面前尽情表现之后，他便把注意力投到了其他人身上，他认为每个人都必然需要他的关注。他的快乐自由地释放出来，无拘无束，因为他是最富有爱心的生物，如果他变成人形之后，没有保留他那些做小狗时的缺点，他也应该是最快乐的。他的缺点是嫉妒！他非常爱嫉妒！看到猫咪泰莱特也变成了人形，而且就像他一样，也得到了孩子们的爱抚和亲吻，他的心感觉到一阵剧痛。噢，天啊，他真是讨厌那只猫！看着她在他身边晃悠，看着她也分享着这个家庭的关爱，便是命运要他做出的最大牺牲。但是，他还是毫无怨言地接受了，因为这会令他的小上帝们开心，不过他总是尽可能和那只猫保持距离。但是因为她，他已经犯了很多令他内疚的罪行！难道他没有在一天晚上，偷偷摸摸地溜进柏林格特太太的厨房，想要把那只与他无冤无仇的老公猫掐死？难道他没有把对面房子里的波斯猫的脊背抓破？他偶尔会去城里不就为了追捕那些猫，给他们的生命画上句号，以此发泄他的恶意吗？而现在，泰莱特也要说话了，就像他一样！在这个出现在他面前的新世界中，泰莱特也会和他平分秋色！

“唉，这世界上简直没有公道了！”他苦涩地想着，“没有公道了！”

而这个时候，那只猫，刚刚清理完自己的毛，舔过她的爪子，正温柔地将爪子放在小女孩身上。

她真的是一只特别漂亮的猫。如果我们的朋友泰罗的嫉妒不是那么丑恶的一种感情的话，我们都可能会忽略这种嫉妒了。你怎么可能不被泰莱特的眼睛吸引呢？那就像是镶在祖母绿中的黄宝石一样璀璨啊。你怎么能抗拒轻抚那黑丝绒般美丽的后背的乐趣呢？你怎么能不爱上她那优雅、温柔和高贵的仪态呢？

她温和地笑着，字斟句酌地对麦泰尔说：

“早上好，小姐！你今天早上真是漂亮极了！”

孩子们也同样爱抚着她。

泰罗一直从房间的另一端望着猫。

“现在她也像个人一样用后腿直立着呢，”他低声咕哝道，“她看上去就像个魔鬼，看她那尖耳朵，那长尾巴，还有那黑得像墨水一样的衣服！”他不可自控地低声嘶吼，“她还像那个扫烟囱的乡下人！”他继续咕哝，“那个人我也不喜欢，我也讨厌，我绝对不会将他当作一个真正的人看待，不管我的小上帝们会怎么说……真幸运，”他叹了口气又说，“我知道的东西可比他们多多了！”

但是突然间，他再也没有办法控制自己了，便飞扑向那只猫，他大笑一声，不过更像是咆哮，嘴里喊着：

“我要吓吓泰莱特！汪，汪，汪！”

不过那只猫，在还是动物的时候就自视甚高，现在变成了人形，觉得自己注定是最高贵的。她认为，现在应该在自己和那只狗之间树立一道高高的壁垒，那只狗在她眼中不过是一个没什么教养的人而已，她轻蔑地退后一步，说道：

“先生，我可不认识你！”

面对这种羞辱，泰罗猛地跃起，而那只猫咪则竖起毛发，捻着她粉色小鼻子下面的胡须——这两绺白色的胡须一直让她引以为傲，她觉得这为她全身黑色的皮毛更添光彩——然后，她拱起背，竖直了尾巴，嘴里发出呜呜的声音，她一动不动地站在抽屉柜上，就像中国花瓶盖子上的龙一样。

泰泰尔和麦泰尔都爆笑出声，不过，如果这个时候没有发生一件了不得的事情，这场对峙的结局肯定很糟糕。就在夜里的十一点钟，在冬夜夜半时分，一束极强的光，如同正午时分的阳光，闪闪发亮，璀璨夺目，照射进了小屋当中。

“呀，天亮了！”小男孩不知道是怎么回事，“爸爸会怎么说呢？”

但是，还没等仙女给他指点迷津，泰泰尔就明白了一切，他满怀惊叹，跪在了这一幕刚出现的景象前。

在窗口处，一个大大的光环中间出现了一位无比可爱的女子，她个子高挑，就如同一束金色的麦束。她披着闪亮的纱巾，但这纱巾遮挡不住她的美丽；她光洁的胳膊伸展着，做出了给予的姿势，像是透明的一般；她澄澈的大眼睛让每一个人都感觉如同被环绕在温柔的拥抱当中。

“女王！”泰泰尔说。

“是仙女公主！”麦泰尔叫道，她跪在了哥哥的旁边。

“不对，孩子们，”仙女说，“这是光。”

光微笑着，走向两个孩子。她，来自天国的光，尘世间的力量和美丽，她为自己担负的谦卑使命而骄傲，过去她从来都无拘无束，生活在无尽的空间中，将她的慷慨馈赠给所有人，一视同仁，而此刻她愿意暂时因为一个短暂的魔咒，被限制为人类的形态，以便引领孩子们走入外面的世界，教他们去认识其他的光——思想之光——这种光我们从来都看不见，却可以帮助我们看清一切。

“是光啊！”所有物品和所有动物齐声叫道。因为他们都爱她，开始欢声笑语地围绕着她跳起舞来。

泰泰尔和麦泰尔也喜悦得手舞足蹈。他们从来都没有想过会有这么有趣、这么美丽的派对，他们的叫声盖过了所有声音。

然后，避免不了的事情发生了。突然，响起了三声敲墙的声音，大得足以把房子掀翻。是泰尔爸爸，他被喧闹声吵醒，威胁要过来制止。

“快转动钻石！”仙女对泰泰尔喊道。

我们的小主人公赶紧照办，但是他还没有掌握转动宝石的窍门，一想到爸爸就要过来了，他的手就不住地颤抖。实际上，他现在笨手笨脚的，几乎把那宝贝扯坏。

“别那么快，别那么快！”仙女说，“噢，亲爱的，你转得太快了，他们没有时间回归原位，我们可要有不少麻烦了！”

接着就像是大逃亡一样。小屋的墙壁都失去了光彩，大家都四散奔逃，好变回自己原来的形态。火找不到灯罩了，水跑着奔向水龙头，糖在撕裂的糖纸前站着哭泣，最大的那块面包没有办法挤进自己的烤盘里了，因为其他的面包杂乱无章地挤了进去，把所有空间都占满了。至于那只狗，他现在个子太大，没有办法钻进狗舍的入口，猫也没有办法进自己的篮子里。只有时间们例外，她们一向比人们希望的走得快，此刻毫不迟疑地溜回到了钟表里。

只有光一动不动地站着，镇定平静，给其他人树立了一个镇定的榜样，但这没有什么用，其他人全都在仙女周围啜泣哀号。

“接下来会发生什么？”他们问道，“会有危险吗？”

“好吧，”仙女说，“我应该把真话告诉你们，那些陪伴这两个孩子的人都会在旅途的终点死去。”

他们都拼命地哭起来，除了那只狗，他很高兴能够保持人形，觉得这样就很幸福。现在他已经站在了光的旁边，以便能够走在他的小主人们前面。

就在这时，又响起了一阵更加可怕的敲墙声。

“还是爸爸！”泰泰尔说，“这次他起来了，我能听到他走路的声音……”

“你们看，”仙女说，“现在你们没有选择了，太晚了，你们必须全都跟着我们上路了……但是你，火，不要靠近别人。你，狗，不要欺负猫。你，水，不要流得四处都是。还有你，糖，不要哭了，除非你自己想要化掉。面包拿上装青鸟的笼子。你们全都要到我家，然后我会把动物们和物品们都打扮整齐……咱们从这边走！”

她说着，举起魔杖指向窗户，窗户神奇地向下扩展，变得像是一道门一样。他们都踮着脚尖走出那扇门，然后窗户就又变回了原来的样子。在圣诞夜清澈的月光下，钟声当当地响起，宣告着耶稣诞生的那个时刻。而就在这时，泰泰尔和麦泰尔踏上了寻找能带给人们幸福的青鸟的旅程。





第二章　在仙女家


仙女贝丽露娜的宫殿位于一座很高很高的山顶上，就在通向月亮的路上。那里离月亮非常近，在夏天的晚上，当天空很晴朗的时候，在宫殿的阳台上，你可以清楚地看到月亮上的山脉和峡谷，湖泊和海洋。仙女就在那里观察星象，解读它们的秘密，因为从很久以前，地球就已经没有什么新鲜东西可以供她学习了。

“这个古老的星球已经没有什么能引起我的兴趣了！”她总是对她的朋友山中巨人们这么说，“地球上的人们依然闭着眼睛生活！可怜的东西啊，我真可怜他们！我时不时地到人间去，但也只是出于慈悲，想要拯救那些可怜的孩子，让他们避开黑暗中等待着他们的不幸命运。”

就是因为这个，仙女才在圣诞前夜来到了泰尔家的小屋。

现在还是来说说我们的旅行家们吧。他们还没有走上大路，仙女就想起来，他们不能这样穿过村子，因为过节，现在村子里还灯火通明。不过，她的博闻多识让她无所不能，立刻就能找到实现愿望的办法。她轻轻地按了按泰泰尔的头，许愿说希望他们可以通过魔法到达她的宫殿。立刻就有一团萤火虫围住了我们的旅行家，轻轻地将他们带上了天空。他们还没来得及收起惊奇，就已经到达了仙女的宫殿。

“跟我走。”她说，带着他们穿过一个个房间，一道道走廊，这些房间和走廊全都是金银筑成的。

他们在一个大房间里停了下来，这里四面墙都是镜子，房内还有一个特别大的衣橱，有光从衣橱门缝中流泻出来。仙女贝丽露娜从口袋中掏出一把钻石钥匙，打开了衣橱门。所有人异口同声地发出了惊叹声。里面装着各种奇珍异宝，层层叠叠的，有缀着宝石的披风，各个国家的各种各样的服装，珍珠宝冠，祖母绿的项链，红宝石的手镯……孩子们从来都没有见过这么贵重的东西！而至于那些动物和物品的灵魂，则完全目瞪口呆。这是自然的，你得理解，这是他们第一次看到这个世界，而这个世界展现出来的方式则是非常奇特的。

仙女帮助他们做出了自己的选择。首先，火、糖和猫展示出了特别的品位。火只喜欢红色，立刻就选择了一件带金色亮片的亮红色长袍。他没有戴帽子或围巾，因为他的头总是非常热。糖只能接受白色和灰蓝色的东西，亮色和他甜美的天性不符。他选择了一件蓝白两色的长袍，一顶尖尖的帽子，这帽子就像是个蜡烛熄灭器，他戴在头顶上，显得非常滑稽，但是他自己太蠢了，没有注意这一点，一直像个陀螺一样在镜子前面转来转去，盲目快乐地欣赏着自己。

一直以淑女自居的猫习惯了自己暗色的衣服，总认为黑色看起来很好看，不管什么情况都好看，特别是现在，他们没有带行李旅行，黑色更是极好的选择。她穿上了一套黑色的紧身衣，上面还有黑色的绣花，她的肩上挂着一件长长的天鹅绒斗篷，她光洁小巧的头上戴着一顶大大的骑士帽，帽子上有一根长长的羽毛。然后，她又要了一双山羊皮的软靴，以纪念她那杰出的祖先“穿靴子的猫”，她在前爪上戴了一副手套，保护它们以免被路上的尘土弄脏。

打扮好之后，她满意地照了照镜子。然后她眨着紧张而焦虑的眼睛，翕动着粉色的鼻子，匆匆忙忙地要求糖和火跟她一起出去转转。所以，别人还在选衣服，他们三个便走了出去。我们把注意力放在他们身上一会儿吧，因为我们已经渐渐喜欢上我们勇敢的小泰泰尔了，所以想听听任何可能对他有帮助或是对他造成阻碍的事情。

他们一路穿过了好几条富丽堂皇的走廊，这些走廊就如同悬在天空之中的露台一样，我们的三个密友最后停在大厅中，猫立刻压低声音开始了密会讲话：

“我带你们来这里，是为了讨论一下我们目前的处境。我们一定要珍惜我们最后的自由时光……”

但一阵狂烈的叫声打断了她：

“汪，汪，汪！”

“听！”猫叫道，“是那只傻狗！他闻到咱们的气味了！真是一分钟安宁都没有。咱们藏到栏杆后面去吧。他最好没听到我刚才说的话。”

“来不及了。”糖说，他是站在门口的。

确实来不及了，泰罗过来了，跳着，叫着，喘着粗气，兴高采烈。

一看到他，猫便厌恶地转过了身。

“他穿的是灰姑娘的马车仆从的制服……这还真是配他，他骨子里就是个马屁精！”

她说完这些话，又呜呜叫了两声，然后捻着胡子，充满挑衅地站在糖和火中间。那只善良的小狗没有注意到她的小把戏。他整个心思都沉浸在被打扮得华美的喜悦中，一圈一圈地跳着。这画面很有意思，他的天鹅绒外套像旋转木马一样转来转去，衣服的下摆时不时地飞起来，露出他那被截断过的小尾巴，就因为尾巴时隐时露，所以更具表现力。我必须得告诉你，就像所有良种斗牛犬一样，泰罗在还是小狗的时候，尾巴和耳朵就被剪短了。

可怜的家伙，一直都很嫉妒他的兄弟们的尾巴——长长的尾巴能表达更多的意思。但是身体上的缺陷和命运的艰辛会强化我们的内在品质。由于缺乏自我表达的外在方式，泰罗的灵魂一直在沉默中成长，他的表情总是充满了爱意，非常生动。

今天，他黑色的大眼睛里闪烁着快乐，他突然间变成了一个人！他浑身上下穿着华丽的衣裳，他将陪着小上帝们周游世界，去完成一项伟大的使命！

“瞧瞧！”他说，“瞧瞧！我们多好啊！……看看这花边和绣花！……这是真金的，肯定是的！”

他没有看出其他人在嘲笑他，说实话，他的样子确实非常滑稽。但是就像所有淳朴的生命一样，他没有幽默感。他为他那身天生的黄色皮毛而骄傲，所以他没有穿马甲，确保没有人会质疑他的来历。出于同样考虑，他保留着他的项圈，上面写着他的地址。他外面穿着一件镶着重重的金子花边的红色天鹅绒大外套，一直垂到膝盖处。他认为两侧的大口袋可以装上些食物，因为泰罗很贪吃。他的左耳上斜扣着一顶小圆帽，上面插着一根鱼鹰的羽毛，为了把帽子固定在他那大大的方脑袋上，他用了一根橡皮筋，这将他肥胖松弛的大脸勒成了两半。他的另一只耳朵依然露在外面。这只耳朵被修剪得很小，贴近头部，就像是小小的装螺丝的三角形纸袋子，这只耳朵非常警觉，聆听着所有的声音。所有的声音都像是石头落入水面一样，吸引他的注意力。

他还在后腿上穿上了一双白色鞋面的漆皮马靴，但是他认为他的前爪得经常使用，所以什么样的手套都无法吸引他。泰罗天生性格坚定，不会在一天之间改变习惯，所以，尽管他化身为高贵的人，还是允许自己做一些不合身份的事情。此刻，他正趴在大厅的台阶上，用爪子挠着地面，嗅着墙壁的味道，然后突然间猛地一抖，开始哀号！他的下嘴唇剧烈颤抖着，就像要哭出来一样。

“那个蠢蛋怎么了？”猫问道，她一直在用眼角的余光看着狗。

但是她立刻就明白了：从远处传来了一阵甜美的歌声，泰罗是受不了这歌声。歌声越来越近，一个女孩清亮的声音飘荡在高耸的拱门的阴影里，水出现了。她高高的，纤弱柔美，白得像珍珠一样，她似乎是飘过来的，而不是走过来的。她的动作轻柔而优雅，如梦似幻。她美丽的银色裙子飘荡着，一直垂到膝盖的头发上装点着珊瑚。

一看到她，火就露出粗鲁而充满恶意的本来面目，嗤之以鼻地说：

“她居然没有带把伞！”

但是水是个非常聪明的人，她知道两个人当中她是强大的那个，看着火那炽热的红鼻子，她愉快地打趣他说：

“抱歉，你说什么？……我猜你是在说我前几天看到的那个大红鼻子吧！”

其他人都笑话起火来，他的脸总是像烧红的煤一样。火气得蹿到了屋顶上，准备过会儿再复仇。这个时候，猫走到水的身边，小心翼翼地，极力恭维水的裙子。不用我说大家也都知道，她的话没有一句是真心的，但是她希望能和所有人保持友好，因为她希望得到他们的支持，才能实现她的计划。没有看到面包，她很焦虑，因为她不想在人到齐之前开始说话。

“他到底在做什么呢？”她喵喵地说着，问了一遍又一遍。

“他在挑衣服，挑来挑去没个完。”狗说，“最后，他终于看上了一件土耳其长袍，配了一柄弯刀，和一条土耳其头巾。”

他的话还没说完，一个穿得五颜六色、看不出形状的大块头就过来了，这个大块头堵住了大厅的窄门。原来是面包的大肚子占满了整个门口。不知道为什么，他总是跌跌撞撞的，可能因为他并不怎么聪明，另外，他也不习惯在人类的屋子里面走动。最后，他终于灵光一闪，弯下腰侧着身子挤进门，总算进了大厅。

当然，这进入的过程并不怎么顺利，但是他还是非常高兴。

“我来啦！”他说，“我来啦！我穿上了蓝胡子(1)最好的衣服……你们觉得怎么样？”

狗开始绕着他打转，他觉得面包实在太棒了。那件黄色的天鹅绒衣服上面点缀着银色的月牙儿，让泰罗想到了他喜欢的美味马蹄形面包卷，还有面包头上那花哨的大头巾，真的非常非常像是一个美味的圆面包。

“他多好看啊！”狗叫道，“他多好看啊！”

牛奶羞怯地跟在面包身后。她的心思淳朴，因此比起仙女建议她穿的那些漂亮衣服，她更喜欢自己的奶油外衣。她真的是个谦逊的姑娘。

面包开始谈论起泰泰尔、光和麦泰尔的衣服，这时，猫用一种权威的声音打断了他的话。

“我们到时候就会看到他们的。”她说，“别闲聊了，听我说，时间紧迫，我们的未来很危险……”

大家都迷惑地望着她。他们都明白这是一个严肃的时刻，但是人类的语言对他们来说依然非常难懂。糖痛苦地绞着长手指；面包拍着大肚子；水躺在地板上，似乎在承受着巨大的痛苦；而牛奶只是看着面包，他们俩是多年的好友了。

猫非常不耐烦地继续说：

“仙女说过，旅程的终点也就是我们生命的终点。所以，我们应该用各种办法，尽可能让旅途漫长……”

面包害怕如果自己不再维持人形就会被吃掉，立刻表示赞同；但是狗站得离他们有些远，假装没有听见，内心深处却在怒吼。他非常清楚猫在暗示什么。猫咪泰莱特最后说道：“我们必须不惜一切代价拖延旅程，阻止他们找到青鸟，哪怕会危及那两个孩子的性命。”而那善良的狗，只愿遵从自己内心的意愿，听到这些话立刻就扑向猫去咬她。糖、面包和火迅速地拦到两人中间。

“注意秩序！注意秩序！”面包傲慢地说，“我现在可主持着会议呢。”

“是谁选你做会议主席的？”火吼道。

“谁要你跟着掺和的？”水把自己湿漉漉的头发甩向火。

“抱歉，”糖浑身发抖，却用安抚的语调说，“抱歉……现在是个很重要的时刻……咱们还是友好点儿交谈吧。”

“我十分赞同糖和猫。”面包说，似乎觉得这话能够结束一切。“太荒唐了！”狗说，他吠叫着，露出了牙齿，“那是人类，人类就是一切！……我们必须服从于人类，听从他们的吩咐！……除了人类，我谁也不认！……人类万岁！……人类万岁！……不管生死，全都听人类的！……人类就是一切！”

但是猫那尖锐的声音盖住了其他人的声音。她对人类充满了怨恨，她希望能好好利用化成人形的短暂时刻，给自己的整个种族复仇。

“我们所有人都在这里，”她说，“动物们，物品们，元素们，都拥有自己的灵魂，人类并不了解我们的灵魂。这也是我们保有自己独立性的原因，但如果人类找到了青鸟，他们就会知道一切，他们就会看到一切，我们就会完全任人摆布……想想我们曾自由自在行走在大地上的日子！”但是突然间，她的脸色变了，她的声音变成了低语的嘶嘶声，“注意！我听到仙女和光来了。不用我告诉你们，你们也知道光已经站在了人类那一边，她会用尽办法支持他们，她是我们最可怕的敌人……小心！”

但是我们的朋友们都没有什么耍花招的经验，觉得心中有愧，气氛一时尴尬而不自然，所以，仙女一进门，就问道：

“你们躲在角落里干什么呢？……你们看上去就像是一伙阴谋家！”

他们非常害怕，觉得仙女已经猜到了他们邪恶的企图，他们都跪在了仙女的面前。不过，他们很幸运，仙女根本没有想他们的小脑袋瓜里到底在想些什么。她过来是向孩子们说明旅途开始部分的安排，告知每个人都应该做什么。泰泰尔和麦泰尔手牵着手站在她面前，他们身上穿着华丽的衣服，看起来有点儿惶恐和不知所措。他们用孩子的那种赞赏的目光看着彼此。

小女孩穿了一件黄色的丝绸长裙，裙子上绣着粉色的花朵，缀着金亮片。她的头上戴着一顶可爱的橘色天鹅绒帽子，肩上还罩着笔挺的平纹布小抵肩。泰泰尔穿着红色夹克和蓝色灯笼裤，一身都是天鹅绒的，当然，他头顶上戴着那顶神奇的小帽子。

仙女对他们说：

“青鸟有可能躲在回忆之地——你们祖父母的家里，所以你们要先到那里去。”

“但是他们已经死了，我们怎么才能见到他们呢？”泰泰尔问。

善良的仙女解释说，只要他们的孙子孙女还在想念着他们，他们就不会真正死去。

“人们不知道这个秘密，”她补充说，“但是，因为这颗钻石，泰泰尔，你会看到，那些我们想念的逝者依然快乐地生活着，就像他们没去世时一样。”

“你和我们一起去吗？”男孩转头问光。光就站在刚进门的地方，将整个大厅照得十分明亮。

“不。”仙女说，“光不能回到过去。她的能量必须留着给未来。”

在两个孩子正准备上路时，突然觉得非常饿。仙女立刻吩咐面包给他们一些吃的东西。那个大胖子非常高兴自己得此重任，便解开长袍，拔出弯刀，从肚子上切了两块下来。两个孩子欢欣雀跃。泰罗暂时抛开了不开心，也要了一点儿面包。大家都互道珍重。糖认为自己很重要，为了给大家留下好印象，就掰下了自己的两根手指，递给了吃惊不已的孩子。

所有人都向门口走去，仙女贝丽露娜拦住了他们。

“今天还不行。”她说，“孩子们必须独自上路，有别人陪着他们并不合适，他们是要去和他们已故的家人共度这个夜晚。所以，出发吧！再见，亲爱的孩子们，记着要按时回来，这非常重要！”

两个孩子手拉着手，拎着大鸟笼子，走出大厅。而他们的朋友们，在仙女的指挥下，排好队准备回到宫殿中。我们的朋友泰罗，是唯一一个没有在点名的时候回应的。他听到仙女说孩子们要独自前往，便立刻决定无论发生什么事都要跟过去照顾他们。于是在其他人道别的时候，他躲到了门后面。但是这可怜的家伙并没有想到没有什么能逃过仙女贝丽露娜那无所不见的眼睛。

“泰罗！”她叫道，“泰罗！过来！”

可怜的小狗一向驯服听话，不敢抗拒这命令，只好夹着尾巴回来了，站在了队伍当中。他绝望地低声呜咽着，看着他的两个小主人消失在巨大的黄金楼梯的尽头。

第三章　回忆之地


仙女贝丽露娜告诉过两个孩子，回忆之地并不远，可要到达那里，必须穿过一片森林，那片森林浓密而古老，身处其间，眼睛都无法看到树顶。而且，森林里总是被浓重的雾气笼罩着，如果仙女没有提前告诉他们“就在正前方，只有那一条路”，他们肯定会迷路的。

林中的地上铺满了鲜花，这些花几乎都是同一种，全都是雪白色的三色堇，非常漂亮。但是因为这些花从来都见不到阳光，所以全都没有香味。

这些小花让本来感到非常孤单的孩子们得到了一些安慰。他们身处无边而神秘的寂静之中，浑身发抖，心里有一种恐惧的感觉，但又交织着快乐，这种感觉他们从来都没有过。

“咱们给奶奶带一束花吧。”麦泰尔说。

“好主意！她肯定会喜欢的！”泰泰尔大声说。

于是，他们一边走，一边摘花，很快就摘了一束漂亮的白色花朵。这两个可爱的小家伙并不知道，他们摘下的每一朵三色堇（三色堇的花语是“一份思念”）都令他们与祖父母更近一些。很快他们便看到眼前有一棵大橡树，上面钉了一个告示牌。

“我们到了！”男孩喜悦地叫道，他顺着橡树的一条根爬上去，读道：“回忆之地。”

他们已经到了，但是他们看了看四周，却什么都没有看到。

“我什么也看不到。”麦泰尔低声啜泣，“我觉得很冷！……还累了！……我不想再走了！”

泰泰尔一心沉浸在自己的使命中，因此便发起了脾气：

“好啦，别像水一样总哭个不停！……你这么做很丢脸啊！”他说，“嘿！看啊！快看！雾散了！”

的确，他们眼前的雾散开了，就像是面纱被一只看不到的手撕裂，大树纷纷隐去，所有的东西都消失了，然后出现了一个漂亮的小农舍，小屋在一个小花园当中，屋上爬满了藤萝，花园里开满了鲜花，还有果实累累的树木。

孩子们立刻就认出了果园中那头可爱的奶牛、门口那儿的看门狗、柳条鸟笼中的黑鹂。一切都沐浴在淡淡的光晕中，温馨而美丽。

泰泰尔和麦泰尔呆住了。这就是回忆之地！这里的天气多好啊！待在这里感觉真舒服啊！他们立刻就决定要经常回到这里，因为他们已经认识路了。而最令他们开心的是，当迷雾最终散尽的时候，他们看到，在离他们几步远的地方，爷爷和奶奶正坐在一条长椅上沉沉地睡着。两个孩子拍着手，高兴地大声喊道：

“是爷爷！是奶奶！……他们在这儿！他们在这儿！”

但是，他们对这神奇的一幕有点儿害怕，不敢从树后面出来。他们站在原地，看着亲爱的爷爷奶奶。两个老人已经渐渐醒了过来。然后，他们听到泰尔奶奶颤抖的声音说：

“我觉得我们那还活着的孙子孙女今天要来看我们。”

泰尔爷爷回答道：

“他们肯定想着我们呢，因为我也有种奇怪的感觉，有点儿坐立不安呢。”

“我觉得他们肯定就在附近，”奶奶说，“因为我看到喜悦的眼泪就在我眼前舞动，而且……”

奶奶的话还没有说完，两个孩子就投入了她的怀抱！……这可真是开心啊！他们又是亲吻，又是拥抱！多惊喜啊！这种幸福简直难以用语言来形容。他们大笑着，却说不出什么，只是一直欣喜地望着彼此。真是再没有这么令人开心、令人惊喜的相见了啊！当最初的激动过去后，他们立刻聊了起来。

“你现在长得真是又高又壮啊，泰泰尔！”奶奶说。

爷爷也喊道：“还有麦泰尔！看看啊，多美的头发，多漂亮的眼睛啊！”

两个孩子手舞足蹈，高兴地拍着手，争抢着投入爷爷奶奶的怀抱中。

最后，他们终于平静了一些，麦泰尔依偎在爷爷的胸口，泰泰尔舒服地坐在奶奶的膝头，他们开始谈论家里的事情。

“你们的爸爸妈妈怎么样了？”奶奶问。

“他们很好，奶奶。”泰泰尔说，“我们出门的时候他们正在睡觉。”

奶奶亲了亲他们，又说：

“天啊，他们两个真是又漂亮又可爱又干净！……你们怎么不多来看看我们呢？你们已经把我们忘了很长很长时间了，我们谁也见不到……”

“我们来不了，奶奶，”泰泰尔说，“今天是因为仙女的帮助，我们才能来的。”

“我们一直都在这里，”泰尔奶奶说，“等着那些我们活着时认识的人来访。你们上一次来这里，还是在万圣节的时候……”

“万圣节？那天我们没有出门啊，我们俩都感冒了！”

“但是那天你们想我们了！每次你们想到我们，我们就会醒来，能再看到你们。”

泰泰尔想起仙女跟他说过这一点。那时候他觉得这是不可能的，但现在，当他的头贴在他非常想念的奶奶的胸口时，他开始懂了，他觉得他的祖父母并没有完全离开他。他问：

“你们是真的死了吗？”

爷爷奶奶放声大笑。现在，他们用原来在尘世的生活换了另一种更加舒服更加幸福的生活，他们已经忘了“死”这个字眼了。

“‘死’是什么意思？”爷爷问。

“嗯，就是一个人不再活着了。”泰泰尔说。

爷爷和奶奶只是耸了耸肩。

“活着的人谈到其他的存在形式时是多么愚蠢啊！”两个老人说。

他们又继续谈论起过去的事情，享受着能够和孩子们交谈的快乐。

老人都爱谈论过去。对于他们来说，未来已经消失了，所以他们总是沉浸在现在与过去。但是我们和泰泰尔都开始没有耐心了，相比听他们说下去，我们更愿意关注我们小朋友的举动。

泰泰尔从奶奶的膝盖上跳下来，四处翻弄，很高兴地发现各种各样他知道并且记得的东西。

“什么都没变，一切都还在原来的位置！”他喊道。而且，因为他已经有很长时间没有来爷爷奶奶家了，对他来说，一切都显得更加可爱。然后，他用一种了然一切的声音补充道：“所有东西都更漂亮了！……嘿，这是那个钟，我有一回把那个大指针的尖儿给弄断了。还有这个我在门上弄出来的洞，那天我发现了爷爷的手钻……”

“是啊，那时候你可真搞了不少破坏啊！”爷爷说，“这是那棵李子树，我看不到的时候，你们总是喜欢往树上爬……”

泰泰尔并没有忘记自己的使命，问道：

“我猜，青鸟是不是碰巧在你们这里啊？”

就在这时，麦泰尔也抬起了头，她看到了一个鸟笼，“嘿，是那只老黑鹂！……它还唱歌吗？”

她正说着，黑鹂就醒了过来，大声地唱了起来。

“你看，”奶奶说，“只要有人想到它……”

泰泰尔惊讶地看着眼前的一切。

“它是青色的啊！”他喊道，“哎呀，就是这只鸟儿，这就是青鸟！……它是青色的，青色的，就像是青玻璃球那样的青色！……你们能把它给我吗？”

爷爷奶奶欣然同意。泰泰尔满怀着胜利的喜悦，去大树边拿来他刚刚放在那里的笼子。他小心翼翼地把那只神奇的鸟儿放进笼子，鸟儿在它的新家中跳来跳去。

“仙女会多开心啊！”男孩看着青鸟喜悦不已，“光也会高兴的！”

“过来，”爷爷奶奶说，“过来看看奶牛和蜜蜂。”

两个老人步履蹒跚地穿过花园时，孩子们突然问，他们死去的小弟弟和小妹妹们是不是也在这里。就在这个时候，七个本来一直在屋子里睡觉的小孩儿突然大哭着跑进了花园。泰泰尔和麦泰尔跑向他们，他们挤在一起，互相拥抱着，一起跳着、转着，开心地大声叫着。

“他们来了，他们来了，”奶奶说，“你一说到他们，他们就出现了，这些小淘气鬼！”

泰泰尔揪住一个小孩子的头发。

“嘿，皮埃罗！咱们再打一架啊，就像过去一样！……还有罗伯特！……我说，吉恩，你的陀螺呢？……玛德琳，皮尔丽特，还有波琳！嘿，雷奎特！”

麦泰尔大笑着说：

“雷奎特现在还是只能爬来爬去的呢！”

泰泰尔注意到有一只小狗在他们周围叫着，“那是奇奇，我用波琳的剪刀剪了它的尾巴……它也没有变……”

“是啊，”爷爷语重心长地说，“这里什么都没有变！”

但是，突然之间，在一派欢乐的气氛中，老人们呆住了，就像是中了魔法一样——他们刚刚隐约听到屋里的钟敲了八下。

“怎么回事啊？”他们问道，“它从来都不报时的……”

“那是因为我们从来都不想时间的问题，”奶奶说，“有谁刚刚想到了时间吗？”

“有，我想了，”泰泰尔说，“是八点钟了吗？……我得走了，因为我答应过光要在九点之前回去的……”

他想去拿笼子，但其他人都正是开心的时候，不想让他这么快就走，这样就告别，实在太糟糕了！奶奶想到了一个好主意，她知道泰泰尔是个小贪吃鬼。现在是吃晚饭时候了，而且幸运的是，还有美味的卷心菜汤和漂亮的李子馅饼。

“好吧，”我们的小主人公说，“反正我已经找到了青鸟！……但卷心菜汤可不是天天都能喝到的！”

他们很快就把桌子抬到屋外，在上面铺了一块漂亮的白色桌布，给每个人摆了一个盘子。最后，奶奶端出了热气腾腾的汤盆。灯被点亮了，爷爷奶奶和孩子们都坐下来吃饭。孩子们互相推挤，用胳膊肘顶着彼此，开心地又笑又闹。之后，有一段时间，除了木头勺子和汤盘撞击的声音，就没有别的声音了。

“真好吃啊！啊，真好吃啊！”泰泰尔喊道，他一直狼吞虎咽地吃着，“我还想要！还要！还要！还要！”

“好啦，好啦，安静一些，”爷爷说，“你还像过去一样没规矩，你会把盘子打破的……”

泰泰尔没有理会这批评，他站到凳子上，抓住汤盆，拉向自己，结果却把汤盆打翻了，热汤洒得四处都是，流到了所有人的大腿上。孩子们疼得尖叫起来。奶奶被吓了一大跳。爷爷气坏了，他使劲扇了泰泰尔一个耳光。

泰泰尔呆了一阵儿，然后他狂喜地把手放在了脸颊上，叫道：

“爷爷，真好，真是太好了！这和你活着的时候打我的耳光一模一样！……我一定要亲亲你！”

大家都笑了。

“你要是喜欢，可还有很多！”爷爷气呼呼地说。

但同时，他心里也感动了，扭头擦了擦眼泪。

“天啊！”泰泰尔猛地一惊，“八点半了！……麦泰尔，我们得走了！”

奶奶恳求他们再多留一会儿，但是没有用。

“不，我们不能留了，”泰泰尔坚定地说，“我向光保证过的。”然后他匆匆地拿起那个宝贵的鸟笼。

“再见，爷爷……再见，奶奶……再见，弟弟妹妹们！皮埃罗，罗伯特，波琳，玛德琳，雷奎特，还有你，奇奇……我们得走了……奶奶，别哭，我们会经常回来的！”

可怜的老爷爷非常伤心，大声抱怨着：

“天啊，活在世上的人可真烦啊，总有许多不得不做的事情！”

泰泰尔努力安慰他，再次保证会经常回来的。

“每天都回来！”奶奶说，“这是我们仅存的快乐了，当你们想到我们，就是来看我们，对我们来说就是快乐。”

“再见！再见！”弟弟妹妹们齐喊着，“要快回来啊！给我们带些麦芽糖！”

他们亲了又亲，挥舞着手绢，大声告别。但他们的身形开始渐渐消失了，声音越来越小，渐渐听不到了。两个孩子再一次身处迷雾之中，古老的森林仿佛巨大的黑幕将他们包围起来。

“我害怕！”麦泰尔低声说，“牵着我的手，小哥哥！我好害怕！”

泰泰尔也在发抖，但是他有责任安慰和保护小妹妹。

“嘘！”他说，“记住，我们带了青鸟回去呢！”

他的话刚说完，一道细细的光就划破阴霾，小男孩向着光走去。他紧紧地抱着鸟笼，借着光看了一眼那只鸟儿……啊呀，天啊，真是令他失望极了！来自回忆之地的美丽青鸟现在变成了黑色的！泰泰尔一直盯着它，可鸟儿就是黑色的！唉，就是他熟悉的那只——过去挂在门口的柳条笼子中唱歌的黑鹂啊！到底怎么回事？真是令人痛心！生活对他们来说多残酷啊！

他怀着强烈的渴望和喜悦踏上旅途，从来都没有想过会遇到什么困难和危险。他信心满满，无所畏惧，满怀善意，相信自己能够找到给仙女的小女儿带来幸福的美丽青鸟。而现在，他的所有希望都破碎了！我们可怜的朋友第一次意识到等待着他的还有磨难、烦恼和困难。唉，他是在尝试一件不可能的事情吗？仙女是拿他寻开心吗？他会找到青鸟吗？他所有的勇气似乎都消失了。

而更加不幸的是，他找不到来时的那条直路了。地上一朵白色三色堇都没有，他哭了起来。

不过幸运的是，我们的小朋友的麻烦并没有持续太久。仙女曾经保证过光会守护着他们。第一次的磨难结束了。就如同刚才在爷爷奶奶家门外的时候一样，迷雾突然间散开了。只是这次出现的不是一幅平静、温馨、柔美的居家图景，而是一座美轮美奂的庙宇，庙宇中射出了耀眼的光芒。

光就站在庙门处，穿着她那钻石色泽的衣服，美丽夺目。她微笑着听泰泰尔讲述自己遭遇的失败。她知道两个孩子在寻找什么，她知道一切。因为光用她的爱包围着所有世人，只是没有人能毫无保留地喜爱她，接受她，所以没有人知道真理的所有秘密。而现在，由于仙女给男孩的那颗钻石，她将第一次开启人的灵魂。

“别难过，”她对孩子们说，“难道你们见到爷爷奶奶不开心吗？这一天收获这么多幸福还不够吗？你们难道不高兴老黑鹂复活吗？听，它在唱歌呢！”

老黑鹂正起劲儿地唱着歌，它在大笼子中跳来跳去，黄色小眼睛中闪烁着喜悦的光芒。

“当你们在寻找青鸟的过程中，我亲爱的孩子，要学会去爱你们在路上找到的灰色的鸟儿。”

光满含深意地点了点头，很显然，她知道青鸟在哪里。但是生活中总是充满美丽的谜团，对此我们必须心怀敬意，不要去破坏。如果光直接告诉孩子们青鸟在哪里，那么，他们就根本找不到青鸟。我会在这个故事结尾的时候告诉你们为什么。

现在，让我们两个小朋友在光的照顾下，在美丽的白云上美美睡上一觉吧。





第四章　夜宫


在第一缕晨曦出现后不久，孩子们和他们的朋友会合了，他们要去夜宫，希望能在那里找到青鸟。点名的时候，好几个伙伴都没有到。对于牛奶来说，任何刺激都是可怕的，所以，她一直留在她的房间里面。水给出的理由是：她习惯了躺在苔藓床上旅行，现在她因为直立行走已经累得半死，害怕会累病。至于光，从创世之初她就和夜不合。而火，和光是亲戚，自然同仇敌忾。光亲了亲两个孩子，把去夜宫的路告诉了泰罗，因为他是负责带路的，然后，这个小队就出发了。

你们可以想象这幅画面：亲爱的泰罗走在前面，他用后腿走路，就像个小人儿一样，昂着头鼻子朝天，舌头垂过下巴，前爪交叠在胸前。他一刻都闲不下来，嗅来嗅去，跑前跑后，把所有的路都跑了两遍，根本不在乎有多累。他知道自己责任重大，根本不理会路上的诱惑：垃圾堆他理都不理，完全不关注他看到的任何东西，过去的老朋友他也不理会。

可怜的泰罗啊！他很高兴变成人形，但他并不比以前幸福多少！当然，对他来说，生活并没有什么变化，因为他的本性并没有任何变化。他依然像一只狗一样去感知，去思考，就算变成了人形，又有什么用呢？实际上，因为现在承担的责任，他的麻烦反而增加了一百倍。

“唉！”他叹了口气。他不假思索地加入了他的小上帝们的探寻之旅，从来都没有想过，旅途结束时他的生命也会结束。“唉，”他说，“如果我能够抓住青鸟那个淘气鬼，相信我，我连舔都不会舔它一下的，哪怕它可能肥美得像只鹌鹑。”

面包郑重地跟在他后面，手里拎着鸟笼。接着是两个孩子，糖走在最后。

但是，猫去哪儿了呢？要找到她缺席的原因，我们必须回溯前面，去探究一下她的想法。当泰莱特在仙女宫殿大厅召集动物和物品们一起开会的时候，她就在酝酿一个拖延行程的计划。但是她没有想到听众们那么傻。

“那些傻瓜，”她想，“全都傻乎乎地跪在仙女脚下，就像是犯了什么罪一样，差点就把我的计划全盘托出了。我最好还是自力更生。在我的猫生中，我们所有的训练都建立在怀疑之上，我明白在人类的生活中也是如此。那些信任他人的人，总是遭到背叛，最好的处世之道是保持沉默，自己做个背叛者。”

我亲爱的小读者们，你们应该看明白了，猫和狗是一样的，她也没有改变她的灵魂，仍然继续参照之前的生活经验。但是，可以确定的是，她非常邪恶，而我们亲爱的泰罗则非常善良。因此，泰莱特决定要独自行动，在天亮之前就出发，去拜访夜——夜和她是老朋友了。

通往夜宫的路漫长而危险。路的两边都是峭壁，你必须在高耸嶙峋的岩石间爬上爬下，再爬上。那些高耸的岩石好像随时都有可能砸到路人身上。最后，你会来到一个黑暗圆圈的边缘。你必须从那里向下走几千级台阶，才能到达夜居住的黑色大理石的地下宫殿。

猫过去经常去那里，她一路飞奔，轻盈得如同一片羽毛。她的斗篷被风吹得撑了起来，就像一面旗帜，在她身后飘荡。她帽子上的羽毛饰品优雅地微微颤动，她灰色的小山羊皮靴几乎都不着地。很快，她就到达了她的目的地，跳跃了几下之后，便来到了夜所在的宫殿大厅。

这里的景象真的非常神奇。夜如同女王一样高贵威严，靠在她的王座之中，她睡着了。她的周围没有一丝亮光、一颗星星。但是我们知道，对猫来说，夜没有秘密，猫的眼睛拥有看穿黑暗的能力，所以泰莱特看夜，就如同在明亮的日光下那么清晰。

在唤醒她之前，猫充满爱意地望了望那慈爱而熟悉的脸庞。那张脸白白的，泛着银光，如同月亮一般。脸上的五官透着坚定，令人既敬又畏。夜围着长长的黑纱巾，她若隐若现的身体如同希腊雕像一样美。她有一双修长的手臂，还有一对巨大的翅膀，现在，这对翅膀在睡梦中收了起来，它们从夜的肩膀一直垂到脚面，让她显出一种无与伦比的威严之感。尽管泰莱特对夜感情深厚，此刻却没有浪费太多时间打量她。现在可是生死攸关的时刻，时间紧迫。她疲惫不堪，痛苦烦乱，瘫在了王座的台阶上，悲伤地喵喵叫着。

“是我呀，夜妈妈！……我累坏了！”

夜生性焦虑，非常容易紧张。夜的美丽由平静与安宁构筑，沉默是其美丽的秘密，而生命却始终不断地打扰着这份寂静：一颗星星划过天际，一片叶子飘向大地，猫头鹰啸叫，甚至是几乎无法耳闻的动静，都足以撕裂她每晚罩向人间的黑色天鹅绒帷幕。所以，猫还没有说完，夜便坐了起来，浑身颤抖。她巨大的翅膀在身侧挥动着，她用一种颤抖的声音询问泰莱特。当她得知即将到来的危险时，便开始哀叹自己的命运。什么！一个人类的孩子要来她的宫殿！而且，有可能在魔法钻石的帮助下，发现她的秘密！她应该怎么办？她会怎么样？她该如何保护自己？夜此刻也忘了自己会冒犯沉默——她自己特别的神，开始放声尖叫。陷入如此混乱的状态，她很难找到应对麻烦的良方。幸运的是，泰莱特已经见惯了人类的烦恼和焦虑，抵抗能力更强。她比孩子们提前出发，已经有了计划，她希望能够说服夜采纳这个计划。于是，她简明地向夜解说：

“尊贵的夜，我看只有一个办法了。因为来的是孩子，我们必须要吓吓他们，吓得他们不敢坚持打开大殿最里面的那扇大门，这样便无法找到门内的月鸟和青鸟。而其他隐室内的秘密肯定会吓到他们的。我们的安全就指望你让他们感到恐惧了。”

显然，也没有别的办法了。夜还没来得及回答，就听到了一个声音。她美丽的脸孔皱了起来，她的翅膀愤怒地伸展开，她所有的举动都在告诉泰莱特，她已经同意了泰莱特的这个计划。

“他们来了！”猫叫道。

小团队正沿着夜宫的阴暗台阶向下走。泰罗勇敢地大步走在前面，泰泰尔紧张地四处打量。他找不到任何让他安心的东西。这里非常大，也非常吓人——请想象一个巨大而神奇的黑色大理石大厅，如同墓穴一样肃穆壮观。这里看不到屋顶，圆形剧场周围的乌木廊柱直指天空。只有当你抬头向上看的时候，才能看到来自星星的隐约光芒。四周被最浓重的黑暗笼罩着。在一扇丰碑一样的铜门前，是夜的王座，王座两侧闪动着两团不安的火焰——只有两团而已。再往两侧，柱子和柱子之间，隐约可见一扇扇青铜大门。

猫冲到孩子们身旁说：

“这边走，小主人，这边走！……我已经跟夜说过你们要来的事情了，她很高兴见到你们。”

泰莱特声音温柔，笑意盈盈，让泰泰尔安定了下来。他迈着勇敢而自信的步子，走向王座。

“日安，夜夫人。”

这声问候让夜感到被冒犯了，“日安”令她想到了她的宿敌——光。她冷冷地答道：

“日安？我可不习惯这个说法！……你应该说，晚安，至少该说晚上好！”

我们的小主人公不想争执。在这位庄严的女士面前，他觉得自己很渺小。他立刻道歉，以他能表现出的最和气的态度，非常温柔地请求夜允许他们去她的宫殿内寻找青鸟。

“我从没见过青鸟，它不在这儿。”夜说，她拍动着巨大的翅膀，想要吓住男孩。

但是男孩十分坚持，没有表现出恐惧，而夜已经开始担心那颗钻石了，怕那钻石将照亮她的黑暗，将彻底摧毁她的力量。她认为最好还是假装自己一时冲动愿意慷慨大方一回，所以，便立刻指了指王座台阶上的大钥匙。

泰泰尔没有丝毫犹豫地拿起钥匙，跑到了大厅的第一扇门前。

大家都在恐惧地颤抖。面包的牙齿嘎嘎作响，糖站得远一些，痛苦万分地嘟囔着。麦泰尔哭着说：

“糖去哪儿了？……我想回家！”

泰泰尔虽然脸色苍白，却依然坚定，他正在开门。而夜阴沉的声音盖过了一片喧闹声，宣布了第一重危险。

“那里是鬼魂！”

“啊，天啊，”泰泰尔想，“我从来都没有见过鬼魂，肯定可怕极了！”

忠诚的泰罗站在泰泰尔身边，拼命地喘着粗气，因为狗讨厌所有诡异的东西。

最后，钥匙开始在锁孔中转动。沉默就如同黑暗一般浓重。没有人敢喘一下气。然后，门开了，眨眼间黑暗之中就飘满了白色的影子，四处窜来窜去。有些长得直耸天际，有些缠绕在柱子上，有些在地上飘来荡去。他们有点儿像人，但面貌却模糊不清，眼睛根本看不清他们。你一看着他们，他们就会变成白色的薄雾。泰泰尔尽全力去追逐他们。而夜夫人在依照猫想出的计划行事，假装很害怕。其实，千百年来，她和鬼魂一直是好朋友，只要一出声就能将他们赶回门内，但是她很谨慎，坚决不这么做，像疯了一样挥舞着翅膀，呼天喊地尖叫：

“把他们赶走！把他们赶走！救命！救命！”

不过，那些可怜的鬼魂，因为人类不再相信他们的存在，他们都没什么机会出来了，现在能够自由呼吸简直欣喜若狂，如果不是害怕一直要咬他们腿的泰罗，他们肯定不会回到门内去。

“呜汪！”最后，门终于关上了，狗气喘吁吁地说：“上帝知道的，我的牙齿可锋利了！但我真没见过那样的家伙！你咬他们的时候，会觉得他们的腿是棉花做的。”

这个时候，泰泰尔走到了第二扇门前，问道：

“这扇门后面是什么？”

夜做了个手势，像是要阻拦他。这个固执的小家伙真的想把什么都看一遍吗？

“我打开的时候需要很小心吗？”泰泰尔问。

“不用，”夜说，“没必要。里面是疾病。他们都是很安静很可怜的小东西。过去一段时间，人类一直在和他们作战！……你自己去打开看吧……”

泰泰尔把门开得大大的，站在那里惊讶得说不出一句话来：里面什么都没有……

他正准备把门重新关上，这时，他被一个小人儿给挤到了一边。那小人儿穿着睡衣，戴着棉布睡帽，在大厅里面跳来跳去，摇晃着脑袋，咳嗽个不停，还不断地擤鼻涕，而她脚上的拖鞋太大了，根本不合脚，一直往下掉，她只能拖着走路。糖、面包和泰泰尔都不再害怕，而是笑成了一团。但是他们一靠近那个戴着棉布睡帽的小人儿，也都开始咳嗽和流鼻涕。

“这是疾病里面最无足轻重的一个，”夜说，“这是鼻伤风。”

“啊，天啊，啊，天啊，”糖想，“如果我的鼻涕一直都像这样流个不停，我会完蛋的，我会化掉的！”

可怜的糖啊！他不知道能躲到哪里去。自从旅行开始，他就热爱上了生活，因为他全身心地陷入了对水的爱恋。而这份爱给他带来的是巨大的苦恼。水小姐四处留情，总是希望得到深切的关注，但不特别在意是和谁在一起。和水相处太多，代价是非常高昂的，可怜的糖就发现了这一点，每一次他亲吻水，他自己就会消失一点儿，他已经开始为自己的生命担忧了。

发现自己遭到了鼻伤风的攻击，他真想逃出夜宫，不过他得到了我们亲爱的泰罗的及时救助。泰罗追着那个小妖婆，在泰泰尔和麦泰尔的笑声中将她赶回了门内。两个孩子高兴地意识到，到目前，他们的遭遇都还不怎么可怕。

因此，泰泰尔以更加勇敢的心态跑到了下一扇门边。

“小心！”夜用恐怖的声音叫道，“那里是战争！他们比一切都要更有威力！我不敢想象，如果有人放它们出来，会是什么局面！你们全都站在那儿，准备好了，把那扇门关回去！”

夜的警告还没有说完，我们勇敢的小朋友就开始为自己的鲁莽轻率后悔了。他费力地想把打开的门关上，但没有用，一股强大的力量从里面向外推着门，如潮的鲜血从门缝中往外涌，火焰蹿了出来，呐喊、咒骂和呻吟声中还混杂着炮火和机枪的声音。夜宫中的所有人都慌作一团，疲于逃命。面包和糖想要逃出去，却找不到出口，最后，大家又回到泰泰尔身边，用尽了全力拿他们的肩膀顶着大门。

猫做出非常恐慌的样子，心中却暗暗高兴。

“也许一切到此就结束了，”她捻着胡须咕哝道，“他们不敢再继续下去了。”

亲爱的泰罗拼尽全力帮助他的小主人，而麦泰尔却站在一个角落里哭个不停。

最后，我们的主人公终于发出了胜利的欢呼：

“太好啦！他们撤退了！胜利了！胜利了！门被关上了！”

说着，他走下台阶，整个人精疲力竭，用他那因为恐惧还在颤抖的可怜的小手抹着额头上的汗。

“好吧，”夜厉声问，“你们满意了吗？你们看到他们了吗？”

“是啊，是啊，”小东西抽泣着回答说，“他们都很丑，而且很可怕，我觉得他们没有青鸟。”

“你应该可以肯定他们没有。”夜愤怒地说，“要是有，他们会当即就把它吃了……你们看，这里已经没有别的了……”

泰泰尔骄傲地挺直身体。

“我必须看完，”他朗声说，“光是这么说的……”

“说起来总是容易，”夜反驳道，“尤其是说这话的人是个胆小鬼，自己躲在家里面！”

“咱们看下一扇门吧，”泰泰尔十分坚定，“那里有什么？”

“这是我关阴暗和恐惧的地方。”

泰泰尔思考了一会儿。

“阴暗啊，”他想，“夜夫人是在开玩笑吧。我来到她的房子已经一个多小时了，见到的都是阴暗，我真希望能够再见到日光。而至于恐惧，如果他们是像鬼魂那样的东西，我们就又有乐子了。”

我们的朋友就走过去将门打开，他的同伴根本就来不及阻止。他们现在全坐在地板上，经历过刚才的一战后都累得精疲力竭，惊奇地看着彼此，因劫后余生而庆幸。就在这时，泰泰尔拉开了门，什么都没有出来。

“这里什么都没有！”他说。

“有，有的！有，有的！小心啊！”夜依然在假装害怕。

她真的怒火中烧。她本来希望利用恐惧吓住他们，但是，看啊，那些被人类冷落的可怜虫现在反而怕人。她用温和的语言鼓励他们，成功引诱了几个披着灰纱巾的高个子出来。他们开始在大厅里跑来跑去，但听到孩子们的笑声时，他们感到了恐惧，便匆匆跑回了门内。夜的尝试又失败了，最可怕的时刻来临了。泰泰尔已经走向了大厅尽头的那扇大门。夜发出了最后的警告。

“不要打开那扇门。”夜用畏惧的声音说。

“为什么不能？”

“因为这是被禁止的。”

“那么，这儿就是青鸟藏身的地方。”

“不要再继续了，不要玩火，不要打开那扇门！”

“但是为什么？”泰泰尔固执地问。

夜被泰泰尔的坚持给激怒了，她火冒三丈，向泰泰尔抛出了最恐怖的威胁：

“只要是打开那扇门的人，哪怕只打开了一丝头发大小的缝隙，都没有活下来见到日光的！打开这扇门就意味着必死无疑。如果你还坚持要去打开这扇门的话，那你就会知道尘世间人们所说的所有恐惧、可怕、骇人的事情，都不如这扇门后等着你的东西可怕。”

“不要去开门，亲爱的主人。”面包的牙齿在咯咯作响，“千万不要开门！可怜可怜我们吧！我跪下求你了！”

“你是要把我们所有人的生命都牺牲掉。”猫喵喵叫着说。

“我不要你去！我不想要你去！”麦泰尔抽泣着说。

“可怜可怜我们吧！”糖绞着手指呜咽道。

他们所有人都在哭泣，所有人都挤在泰泰尔身边。只有亲爱的泰罗除外，他非常尊重小主人的意愿，不敢多说一句话，不过他也十分确信他的生命快到终点了。他的两只大耳朵垂到了脸颊上，他绝望地舔着泰泰尔的手。这一幕真是令人动容啊。有一瞬间，我们的小主人公动摇了。他的心怦怦地狂跳，喉咙因苦恼而干涩，他想要说点儿什么，却什么也说不出来，另外，他也不想在这些不幸的同伴面前表现出怯懦来。

“如果我没有能力去完成使命，”他对自己说，“那么谁能去完成它？如果我的朋友们注意到我的绝望，那我就完蛋了，他们不会让我去继续我的使命，我就根本找不到青鸟。”

想到这里，男孩的心又受到鼓舞，他那豪迈的天性再度被唤起。如果幸福就在咫尺之遥，不去尝试努力一下是绝对不行的，即便是冒着在尝试中死去的危险，也要去努力找到它，将它交给全人类。

就这样了！泰泰尔决定要牺牲自己。他就像是一个真正的英雄，挥舞着沉重的金钥匙，大声说：

“我必须打开这扇门！”

他跑到那扇大门边，泰罗跟在他身旁。可怜的狗已经怕得半死，但是他的骄傲和他对泰泰尔的忠诚促使他压抑住了自己的恐惧。

“我要留下来，”他对自己的主人说，“我不怕！我要和我的小上帝一起进退！”

这个时候，其他人都逃掉了。面包躲在一根柱子后面浑身抖得像筛糠一样。糖搂着麦泰尔缩在一个角落里，害怕得快化掉了。夜和猫在大厅的另一端，也一直在发抖，但她们是因为愤怒，而非恐惧。

泰泰尔给了泰罗最后一吻，把他抱在自己胸前，然后稳稳地将钥匙插入了锁孔中。恐怖的叫声从人们躲避的各个角落传来。两扇沉重的大门在我们的小朋友面前神奇地打开时，面对门内的景象，赞叹和欣喜让他一句话都说不出来。这是多么巨大的惊喜啊！在他面前的，是一个神奇的花园，一个梦幻的花园，花园当中，花朵如同星星一样熠熠闪耀，瀑布从天空中倾泻而下，树木沐浴在银色的月光之下。在玫瑰花丛中，有一小片青色云朵状的东西在盘旋。泰泰尔揉了揉自己的眼睛，他简直不敢相信自己看到的。他等了一会儿，又仔细看了一遍，接着就冲入了花园，边跑边像疯子一样大喊：

“快来呀！……快来呀！……它们在这里！……我们终于找到它们了！……这有好多青鸟！……成千上万只！来啊，麦泰尔！……过来，泰罗！……大家都过来！……帮帮我！……一抓就是一把！……”

他的朋友们终于安下心来，全都跑了过来，冲到了鸟群当中，比赛看谁抓得最多。

“我已经抓到七只了！”麦泰尔叫道，“我的手拿不过来了！”

“我也是！”泰泰尔说，“我也抓到太多了！……它们从我怀里逃走了！……泰罗也抓住了一些！……咱们出去吧，咱们走吧！……光在等着我们呢！……她得有多高兴啊！……这边走，这边走！……”

出去的时候，他们全都兴奋雀跃，手舞足蹈，唱着胜利的歌曲。

夜和猫没有像其他人一样感到喜悦，她们担忧地溜到了大门边。夜哀哀地说：

“他们没抓到它，是不是？”

“没有，”猫说，她看到真正的青鸟栖息在一束高高的月光上，“他们够不到它的，它落得太高了……”

我们的朋友全都加紧步伐，沿着连接黑夜与白昼之间数不清的台阶向上爬，走向日光。他们每个人怀中都抱着自己抓到的青鸟，却都没有想到，他们每走上一级台阶，向着光芒靠近一步，对那些可怜的小东西来说都是致命的，等他们走到台阶的顶端，他们带着的，就只是一堆死鸟了。

光正在焦急地等着他们。

“嗯，你们抓住青鸟了吗？”她问。

“是的，是的！”泰泰尔说，“那里有很多青鸟呢！有几千只！看！”

他说着，将这些珍贵的鸟儿递给光看，令他失望的是，那些鸟儿都变成了毫无生命的尸体：它们可怜的小翅膀已经断了，它们的头让人心酸地垂了下来！满心绝望的男孩转头看向他的同伴们。天哪，他们抱着的也都是死鸟！

于是，泰泰尔哭着扑到了光的怀里。又一次，他的希望全都碎成了粉末。

“不要哭，我的孩子，”光说，“你们没有抓住那只能在明亮的日光中生存的青鸟……不过我们会找到它的……”

“当然，我们会找到它的。”面包和糖异口同声地说。

这两个都是傻瓜，不过他们都想安慰男孩。至于我们的朋友泰罗，他实在是气坏了，有一瞬间忘记了自己的尊严，看着那些死鸟说：

“我想知道，它们好吃吗？”

小团队步行返回光的神庙休息。这是一段不愉快的旅程，所有人都在怀念在家时的安乐，都有责备泰泰尔不够细心的冲动。糖蹭到面包身边，在他耳边低语道：

“主席先生，你不觉得这一切都没有什么意义吗？”

面包先生简直受宠若惊，他故作高傲地回答：

“千万不要害怕，我亲爱的朋友，我会把一切修正。如果我们必须唯那个小疯子的疯念头是从，那简直无法容忍！……明天，我们就留在床上！……”

他们都忘了，如果不是那个他们嗤之以鼻的小男孩，他们根本不会活过来，如果小男孩突然间告诉面包他必须要回到烤盘里等着被人吃掉，或是告诉糖他必须被切成小块方糖，加到泰尔爸爸的咖啡里，或是泰尔妈妈的糖浆里，他们肯定会跪倒在小男孩的脚下，乞求慈悲。实际上，他们在不得不面对悲惨结局之前根本就不懂得珍惜自己的好运。

可怜的东西啊！仙女贝丽露娜给他们人的形体时，应该再给他们一些人的智慧。不过，也不应该太过责怪他们，他们只不过是在仿效人而已。给了他们说话的能力，他们就只会信口闲聊；拥有了评判能力，他们就去谴责别人；能够感觉，他们就抱怨。他们的心只会增加恐惧，不会感到快乐。至于他们的脑袋，本可以轻松地将一切安排妥当，但是他们却很少使用，导致那些脑袋都生锈了；如果你打开他们的头颅看一看他们生命内在的结构，你只会看到很可怜的大脑——这是他们最宝贵的资产——却像是豆荚里的干豆子，随着他们的一举一动跳荡，在他们空空的头颅中作响。

幸好，光具有非凡的洞察力，知道他们所有的心思。因此她决定不要过分要求这些元素和物品(1)。

“他们有用，”她想，“至少能够在路上给孩子们提供食物和快乐。但是他们必然无法共同面对困难，因为他们既没有勇气，也没有信念。”

小团队向前走着，路越来越宽阔，越来越明亮，最后，光的神庙出现在眼前，那神庙耸立在一片水晶高地上，散发着万丈光芒。疲惫的孩子们轮流被狗驮着，到达闪光的台阶那里时，他们已经快要睡着了。

第五章　未来国度


第二天早晨，泰泰尔和麦泰尔醒来，非常开心。因为孩子无忧无虑的天性，他们已经将失望抛在脑后了。泰泰尔因为光对他的夸奖而非常高兴。光似乎十分开心，就像是泰泰尔已经将青鸟带回来了。

光微笑着，轻抚着孩子乌黑的鬈发，说：

“我非常欣慰。你是一个善良、勇敢的男孩，你很快就能找到你在寻找的东西。”

泰泰尔并不理解她话中的深层含义，不过他听到这些话仍然很开心。另外，光还许诺说在今天的新旅程中他不会遇到任何恐怖的事情。相反，他会遇到成千上万个孩子，这些孩子会让他见识到世上所有人都没有见过的、最奇妙的玩具。光还告诉他，这一次，他和小妹妹两个人要和她一起上路，而其他人则趁这个机会休息一下。

所以，在本章开始的时候，所有人都在神庙的地窖中相会。光觉得最好将那些元素和物品锁起来。她很清楚，如果放任他们随心所欲，他们可能会跑出去闯出什么祸来。她这样做并不算残酷，因为她神庙的地窖比人类房屋的高层还要明亮宜人，只是没有她的允许你无法离开而已。只有她有魔力打开地窖，她用魔法棒轻轻一点，走廊尽头的祖母绿宝石墙上就会出现一道细细的缺口，慢慢变宽，通过这个缺口，走下几级水晶台阶，然后你就会来到一个像是山洞的地方，里面泛着澄净的绿色光辉，就如同是阳光穿过森林一般。

通常，这个大厅是空荡荡的，但是现在，里面安置了沙发和一张金子做的桌子，桌上摆满了水果、蛋糕、奶油和美味的酒，这是光的仆人刚刚安排好的。光的仆人们都非常奇怪！他们总是能令孩子们大笑：他们穿着白缎长袍，头戴黑色小帽，帽尖上是一簇小火焰，他们的样子就像点燃的蜡烛一样。他们的女主人吩咐他们退下，然后她告诉动物们和物品们尽情享受，问他们是否想要些书或是想玩什么游戏，他们大笑着回答说没什么比吃和睡更令他们开心的了，他们很高兴能够留在这里。

当然，泰罗并不这么认为。他心底的声音盖过了他的贪吃和懒惰，他黑色的眼睛恳求地望向泰泰尔。如果光没有严禁带着狗去的话，泰泰尔是非常愿意带上他忠实的伙伴的。

“我也没有办法，”男孩吻了狗一下，“似乎狗是不能去我们要去的地方的。”

泰罗突然欣喜地跳了起来：一个绝妙的主意出现在他脑海中。他脱离犬类生活的时间还不久，过去的生活都还记得，特别是他的那些烦恼。最烦恼的一点是什么呢？不就是那条锁链吗？被拴在一个铁环上的时间是多么难熬啊！当樵夫带着他去村子里的时候，他忍受着多么大的屈辱啊！真是说不出的蠢，被拴着走在众人面前，让他都没有办法享受和朋友们打招呼的乐趣，也没有办法去闻每个街角、每条沟渠中散发出来的诱人气味。

“好吧，”他自言自语道，“为了和我的小上帝同行，我不得不再忍受一次那种屈辱。”

泰罗恪守传统，尽管他穿着精致的衣服，但还是留着自己的项圈，只不过没有了链子。该怎么办呢？他又一次绝望了，这时，他看到了躺在沙发上的水正心不在焉地抚弄着她的那串长长的珊瑚项链。他以最优雅的姿态跑过去，给水献上了一大堆恭维话，乞求她将最大的那串项链借给他。水的脾气很好，不仅答应了狗的要求，还很友善地将珊瑚链子挂在了泰罗的项圈上。泰罗开心地走到主人身边，将这项链做的链子递给主人，然后跪在主人脚边说：

“请这样带我去吧，我的小上帝！人们不会介意一只被拴着的狗的。”

“唉，就算是这样，你也是不能去的！”光说。她被狗这种自我牺牲的行为感动了，为了令他振作起来，便告诉他，命运很快就会给孩子们安排一场考验，那时候会非常需要他的帮助。

说完这些话，光触碰了一下祖母绿的墙壁，一条通道出现了，她和孩子们走了出去。

她的敞篷马车停在神庙的入口处，这辆车的外壳是翠玉做的，内里镶着金子。三个人在座位上坐好，车前套着的两只白色的大鸟立刻就飞起来冲入云霄。车的速度非常快，他们在路上的时间并不长，这令孩子们感到十分遗憾，因为他们很享受这段行程，不停地笑着。不过，等着他们的将是更美丽的惊喜。

他们身边的云散开，突然间，他们就发现自己身处一个蓝得炫目的宫殿中。这里的一切都是蓝色的，光、石板路、柱子、穹顶，一切，哪怕是最小的东西，都是童话般的深蓝色。这宫殿一眼望不到尽头，眼睛都会迷失在无尽的蔚蓝色之中。

“这一切都多么美好啊！”泰泰尔抑制不住自己的惊讶之情，“天啊，真是美好！……我们这是在哪里啊？”

“我们是在未来国度。”光说，“在还没有出生的孩子中间。魔法钻石让我们可以清楚地看到这片世人看不到的领域，我们也许会在这里找到青鸟……看啊！看看那些跑过来的孩子！”

一群群的孩子从各个方向跑了过来，他们从头到脚都穿着蓝色衣服，头发有的是黑色，有的是金色，全都长得非常漂亮，他们开心地叫着：

“活小孩儿！……来看看活着的小孩儿！”

“他们为什么要叫我们活小孩儿？”泰泰尔问光。

“因为他们自己还不是活的。他们还在等着他们出生的时刻，孩子们都是从这里降生到人间的。当父母们想要孩子的时候，那扇大门就会打开，你能看到的，就在那边，在后边。小孩子们会从那里下去……”

“这里有那么多孩子！有那么多孩子啊！”泰泰尔大声叫道。

“还有更多呢，”光说，“没有人能够数清楚。再走一点儿，你就会看到更多别的东西。”

泰泰尔听了她的吩咐，挤着往前走。不过他很难移动，因为他们周围挤了一大群穿着蓝衣服的孩子。最后，我们的小朋友踏上了一级台阶，终于能越过这一片好奇的小脑袋，看到大厅的各个角落。这里真是太不寻常了！泰泰尔从来都没有想过有这样的地方！他高兴得手舞足蹈，麦泰尔紧紧拉着他的手，踮着脚尖，努力向外看，拍着小手，发出阵阵惊喜的大叫。

他们周围有上百万个孩子，全都穿着蓝衣服，有的在玩耍，有的在散步，有的在说话，有的在沉思。很多在睡觉，也有很多在干活。他们制作的乐器、工具、机械，他们种植或采集的植物、鲜花和水果，全都散发着同样明媚而庄严的蓝光，和整个宫殿的环境十分相称。在孩子中间，有些同样穿着蓝衣的高个子走来走去，他们都非常英俊，看上去就像天使。他们走到光的近前，微笑着温柔地推开周围的蓝衣孩子，蓝衣孩子们很安静地退回去做自己的事了，不过依然用好奇的眼睛打量着我们的朋友。

不过，其中有一个孩子，仍然站在泰泰尔身边。他的个子非常小。在他长长的天蓝色丝绸长袍下面，露出了两只粉嫩嫩、肥嘟嘟的赤裸小脚。他的眼睛好奇地盯着这个活的小男孩，仿佛是不由自主地走向泰泰尔。

“我能和他说话吗？”泰泰尔有点儿开心，但也有点儿害怕。

“当然，”光说，“你们必须要交朋友……我让你们单独留在这里，你们会更加放松的……”

这么说着，她便走开了，留下两个孩子面对着面，羞怯地笑着。突然，他们便开口交谈了。

“你好！”泰泰尔把手递给了那个孩子。

但是那个孩子并不懂这是什么意思，站在原地没有动。

“这是什么？”泰泰尔继续说，他摸了摸孩子的蓝衣服。

孩子一心一意地看着他要看的东西，没有回答，不过用手指一本正经地触碰了一下泰泰尔的帽子。

“这是什么？”他口齿不清地问。

“这？……这是我的帽子，”泰泰尔说，“你没有帽子吗？”

“没有，这是干什么用的？”孩子问。

“这是问好的时候用的，”泰泰尔回答，“另外还有冷的时候……”

“‘冷的时候’是什么意思？”孩子问。

“冷，就是你浑身发抖，像这样朝手上呵气！”泰泰尔说，“你还这样搓胳膊。”他把胳膊抱在身前使劲搓来搓去。

“人间冷吗？”孩子问。

“是的，有时候，冬天，没有炉火的时候。”

“为什么没有炉火？”

“因为很贵，需要花钱去买木头……”

孩子又望向泰泰尔，看样子他根本没有听懂泰泰尔说了什么，这下子，泰泰尔看起来也十分惊讶。

“很显然，他对生活中最常见的东西一无所知。”我们的主人公想，而那个孩子以非常崇拜的目光看着什么都懂的“活的小男孩”。

然后，他问泰泰尔钱是什么。

“哎呀，就是你付给人家的东西啊！”泰泰尔不愿做进一步解释了。

“噢！”孩子很严肃地说。

当然，他还是不懂。这个小男孩一直都生活在天堂中，在这里，就连最微不足道的愿望，在他说出口之前就会变成现实，他怎么能明白那一切呢？

“你多大了？”泰泰尔问，继续他们之间的对话。

“我很快就要出生了，”孩子说，“再过十二年，我就出生了……出生是不是很美好？”

“噢，是啊，”泰泰尔不假思索地答道，“非常好玩！”

但是当小男孩问他怎么生出来的时候，他非常茫然。他的骄傲不允许他在另一个孩子面前表现出一丝一毫的无知，他的手插在马裤口袋中，腿分得很开，头高高仰着，完全是一副不急着去作答的态度，但这模样实在是太滑稽了。最后，他耸了耸肩说：

“哎呀！我不记得了！那是太久之前的事情了！”

“人们都说，人间和活着的人很美好。”孩子评价道。

“是啊，不赖，”泰泰尔说，“有鸟，蛋糕，还有玩具……有些人什么都有，不过什么都没有的人可以看其他人的。”

这回答充分展现了我们的小朋友的性格。他很骄傲，还有点儿趾高气扬。但是他却从不嫉妒，他天生心胸开阔，因此能够欣赏他人的富足，安于自己的贫穷。

两个孩子又说了很多，但是要把他们说的话全都告诉你们需要花很长的时间，因为他们说的事情只是他们感兴趣的。过了一会儿，一直在远处看着他们的光匆匆地走了过来，她有一些焦急，因为泰泰尔哭了！大颗大颗的眼泪从他的脸颊上滚落下来，落到漂亮的外套上。她明白，他是谈到了他的奶奶，想到失去的爱，他便忍不住泪水了。他扭开头，想要掩饰自己的情绪，不过那个好奇的孩子却一直问他问题：

“奶奶们都会死吗？‘死’是什么意思？”

“有天晚上他们走了，就再也不会回来了。”

“你的奶奶走了吗？”

“是的，”泰泰尔说，“她过去对我特别好。”

说到这里，可怜的小家伙又哭了起来。

蓝衣孩子从来都没有见过人哭，因为他住在一个不存在悲伤的地方。他非常非常惊讶，大叫道：

“你的眼睛怎么了？……它们是在造珍珠吗？”

在他看来，眼泪是非常神奇的东西。

“不，这不是珍珠。”泰泰尔很羞怯地说。

“那它是什么？”

我们可怜的朋友不愿承认自己表现得脆弱，他尴尬地揉了揉眼睛，说这都是宫殿令人目眩的蓝光引起的。

迷惑的孩子继续追问：

“那落下来的是什么？”

“没什么，不过是点儿水。”泰泰尔说，他有些不耐烦，希望这解释尽量简短。

但那根本不可能。那个孩子非常固执，用他的手指去触碰泰泰尔的脸颊，还用好奇的语气问：

“这是从眼睛中流出来的吗？……”

“是的，有时候会流，当人哭的时候。”

“‘哭’是什么意思？”孩子问。

“我没有哭啊，”泰泰尔骄傲地说，“全都是这蓝色的错！……不过，要是我真哭了，流出来的也是这东西……”

“你们在人间经常哭吗？”

“小男孩不哭，小女孩经常哭……难道你们不哭吗？”

“不，我不知道该怎么哭……”

“好吧，你会学会的……”

这个时候，一阵猛烈的风吹来，他扭头望去，几步之外，有一个大机器。他之前光顾着和小孩说话了，没有注意到。那是一个非常巨大、非常华丽的东西，但是我没办法告诉你那东西的名字，因为在未来国度的发明出现在人间之前，人是不能给它命名的。我只能说，泰泰尔看着那东西，认为那在他眼前飞快挥动的巨大的蓝色翅膀，就像是他生活的世界中的风车，就算他找到了青鸟，青鸟的翅膀肯定也不会比这对翅膀更精致、更巧妙、更眩目。他心中满是钦佩，他问他新认识的朋友那是什么。

“那些？”孩子说，“那是我要在人间发明的东西。”

孩子看到泰泰尔的眼睛瞪得老大，又补充道：

“我到了人间的时候，会发明能给人带来幸福的东西……你想要看看吗？……就在那边，在两根柱子中间……”

泰泰尔扭头去看，但是所有的孩子都立刻冲到他面前，喊道：

“不，不，先来看我的！”

“不，我的更好些！”

“我的是一件了不起的发明！”

“我的是糖做的！”

“他的不好！”

“我会带来一种人们从来都没见过的光！”说着，最后的这个孩子用一种非常奇特的火焰将自己整个照亮了。

在一片欢乐的喧嚣中，泰泰尔和麦泰尔被拖到了蓝色工作坊边，小发明家们纷纷开动自己的机器，圆盘、滑轮、皮带、飞轮、驱动轮、齿轮以及其他各种各样的轮子都转了起来，立时间刮起了一阵蓝色的旋风，各种各样的机器都跑了出来，这些机器有的可以在地上行驶，有的可以在头顶上盘旋。其他孩子也都展开自己的图表和规划，或是打开沉重的书册，或是掀开蓝色雕像的幕布，或是拿出仿佛是由蓝宝石和绿松石做的巨大的花和硕大的水果。

我们的两位小朋友目瞪口呆地站着，手紧紧地握在一起，他们觉得自己就像是置身在天堂里。麦泰尔弯腰去看一朵巨大的花，开心地大笑着，花瓣遮住了她的头，仿佛给她戴了一顶蓝丝绸做成的帽子。一个长着黑头发和睿智的眼睛的漂亮孩子握着花茎，骄傲地说：

“等我到了人间，花都会长成这样。”

“那是什么时候呢？”泰泰尔问。

“五十三年四个月零九天后。”

接着，两个蓝衣孩子扛着一根杆子走了过来，那杆子非常重，压得他们都弯下了腰，杆子上挂着一大串葡萄，但是每一颗都比梨子还大。

“一大串梨！”泰泰尔叫道。

“不，这是葡萄，”孩子说，“等到我三十岁的时候，葡萄就都会长成这样子了，我已经发现了其中的秘密……”

泰泰尔很想尝尝那葡萄，不过这时，又来了一个孩子，这孩子的身体几乎被一个柳条篮子给挡住了，篮子是由一位个子很高的大人帮他提着的。孩子长着金色的头发，泛着玫瑰色红晕的小脸，透过柳条篮子上垂下来的叶子，露出了微笑。

“来看看呀！”他说，“看看我的苹果。”

“但这些是瓜啊！”泰泰尔说。

“不不，”孩子说，“这是我的苹果。等我出生之后，它们就都会长成这样了。我已经发现了这个转变过程……”

小读者们，如果要我向你们描述出现在我们的主人公面前所有神奇而不可思议的东西，那就没完没了了。不过，突然之间，一阵大笑响彻整个大厅。一个孩子说到了九大行星之王，泰泰尔非常困惑，一头雾水，四处张望。所有蓝衣孩子的脸上都带着笑容，他们的头都转向了一个泰泰尔看不到的位置，每人的手指都指向了同一个方向，但是我们的朋友却还是什么都看不到。他们在谈论一个国王啊！泰泰尔想找到那个王座，王座上应该坐着一个高大而威严的人，手握金色权杖。

“在那边……在那边……再低一些……就在你身后！”有一千个小小的声音异口同声地说。

“但是国王在哪里呢？”泰泰尔和麦泰尔又问道，他们都非常感兴趣。

突然，在众多孩子银铃般的声音中出现了一个更加洪亮、更加严肃的声音。

“我在这里！”他骄傲地说。

就在这时，泰泰尔发现了一个他一直都没有留意到的胖娃娃，因为这个孩子是所有孩子中最小的一个，一直都在人群外，以一种漫不经心的姿态坐在一根柱子下，似乎正在全神贯注地凝视着什么。小国王是唯一一个没有关注“活小孩儿们”的人，他那水汪汪的漂亮的眼睛，就像这个宫殿一样湛蓝，正在追寻着无尽的迷梦，他的右手撑着似乎因为思绪而沉重的头，他穿着短袍，带着肉窝的膝盖露在外面，金色的头发上戴着一顶金色的王冠。当他说“我在这里”的时候，他从坐着的台阶上站了起来，想要一大步跨上台阶，但是动作笨拙，失去了平衡，头朝下摔了下去。他立刻便以无比威严的仪态重新站起来，众人都不敢嘲笑他，这次，他索性手脚并用地爬上了台阶，然后双腿分开站定，从头到脚地打量着泰泰尔。

“你并不很大啊。”泰泰尔努力地压抑着自己的笑意。

“等我大了之后，会做出壮举的！”国王以一种不容置疑的语气反驳。

“到时候你会做什么？”泰泰尔问。

“我会建立太阳系行星总联盟。”国王用一种非常高傲的声音说。

我们的朋友实在太过震惊，简直无言以对。国王继续说：

“所有的行星都会属于这个联盟，只有天王星、土星和海王星例外，这三颗行星远得有些离谱。”

说完这话，他便摇摇晃晃地走下了台阶，恢复了最初的姿态，表示他要说的话都说完了。

泰泰尔任他继续沉思。泰泰尔非常渴望能去了解尽可能多的孩子。他结识了新太阳的发现者，要发明一种新娱乐的发明家，要扫平人间不公的英雄，以及要征服死亡的智者……实在是有太多太多孩子了，需要花很多天才能将他们一一介绍完。我们的朋友实在太累了，开始觉得无聊，不过这时，他突然听到一个孩子在叫他：“泰泰尔！泰泰尔！你好，泰泰尔，你好吗？”他的注意力陡然被唤了起来。

一个漂亮的蓝衣孩子从大厅后面跑了过来，一路挤过人群跑到前面。他皮肤白皙，个子高挑，眼睛明亮，和麦泰尔长得非常像。

“你怎么知道我的名字？”泰泰尔问。

“这并不奇怪。”蓝衣孩子说，“因为我将是你的弟弟呀。”

这一次，这两个活的小孩彻底惊呆了。这是多么不平常的会面啊！他们一回到家就要告诉妈妈这件事！爸爸妈妈该有多惊奇啊！

他们这么想的时候，那个孩子继续解释说：

“我明年就会到你们身边，就在棕枝全日(1)。”

然后，他向他的哥哥提了许多问题：家里舒服吗？吃得好吗？爸爸严厉吗？妈妈呢？

“哦，妈妈非常和气！”两个孩子说。

而他们也反问了他很多问题：他来到人间会做些什么呢？他会带来什么？

“我会带去三种疾病，”小弟弟说，“猩红热、百日咳和麻疹……”

“啊，就这些？”泰泰尔叫道。

他摇了摇头，面露失望，小弟弟继续说道：

“最后，我会离开你们！”

“那你去还有什么价值啊！”泰泰尔感觉十分沮丧。

“我们不能挑拣选择啊！”小弟弟有些烦躁地说。

不用等到去人间，他们可能就会爆发争吵，不过突然间一大群匆匆忙忙要去见某个人的孩子将他们分开了。就在这时，出现了一个巨大的声音，就好像走廊的尽头有千万扇看不见的门正在被同时打开。

“怎么了？”泰泰尔问。

“是时间来了，”一个蓝衣孩子说，“他要开门了。”

周围的人都越来越兴奋，孩子们丢下他们的机器，停下手里的工作，那些睡着的孩子也醒了过来，每双眼睛都充满渴望、紧张地投向了大厅后方的一扇蛋白石大门，众人异口同声地重复着一个名字。“时间！时间！”的喊声响彻大厅。洪亮而神秘的声音依然在继续。泰泰尔真的特别想弄清这是什么意思。最后，他拉住了一个孩子的衣袍下摆，向他询问。

“别拉着我，”孩子非常紧张地说，“我在赶时间，今天应该轮到我了……现在正是黎明时分。这是我们今天要降生的孩子去人间的时刻……你可以看到，时间正在拉开门闩……”

“谁是时间？”泰泰尔问。

“一个来召集去人间的孩子的老人，”另一个孩子说，“他人并不坏，不过他从来都不会听别人的请求。只要是没轮到的孩子，不管怎么恳求，他都会把那些试图过去的给赶回来……放开我！现在可能轮到我了！……”

光十分恐慌地向我们的小朋友们匆匆跑来。

“我正在找你们，”她说，“快点，绝对不能让时间发现你们。”

她说着，就将自己的金色斗篷围在了两个孩子身上，将他们拖到了大厅的一个角落，他们能从那里看到一切，但是别人却看不到他们。

泰泰尔很高兴能受到这样的保护。现在，他知道将要出现在他面前的是一个拥有非常强大力量的人，没有任何人类的力量能够与之抗衡。他既是神，也是妖，他能给予生命，也能吞噬生命。他瞬息之间就能走遍世界，你根本都来不及察觉，他不停地吞噬，任何他触碰的东西他都能带走。他已经带走了泰泰尔的爷爷奶奶，小弟弟们、小妹妹们，还有那只老黑鹂。他一点儿都不在乎自己带走的是什么：无论悲喜，无论冬夏，一切都如同进入他罗网里的鱼！

由于了解这一切，我们的朋友看到未来国度的每个人都飞快地跑去见他，真的非常惊讶。

“我猜，他并不吞噬这里的任何东西。”泰泰尔想。

他来了！大门的门轴缓缓转动，传来一阵隐约的乐声：那是来自人间的声音。一道红绿相间的光照入大厅，时间出现在门槛处。他是一个高高的、瘦削的老人，他是那么苍老，满是皱纹的脸一片灰白，就像尘土一样。白色的胡子一直垂到了膝盖。他一只手拿着一把巨大的镰刀，另一只手拿着一个沙漏。在他身后几步之遥，是一片晨曦色的海洋，海上漂着一艘挂着白帆的巨大的金船。

“那些轮到的人准备好了吗？”时间问。这个声音肃穆而低沉，如铜锣一样。听到这个声音，几千个活泼的孩子的声音便如同小银铃一般与之应和：

“我们准备好了！……我们准备好了！……我们准备好了！……”

瞬间，蓝衣孩子们就都围在了高个老人的身边，老人将他们都推了回去，用冷硬的声音说：

“一次一个！……一次一个，你们来的人可比需要的多！……你们可骗不了我。”

他一手挥舞着镰刀，另一只手撑开斗篷，挡住想要从他身边急匆匆溜过去的孩子。没有一个孩子能在可怕的老人那警惕的眼神下溜过去。

“还没有轮到你！”他对一个孩子说，“你应该明天出生！……你也不是，你还得等十年……第十三个牧羊人？……只需要十二个，不需要更多了……更多的医生？……已经有太多了，人间已经为此抱怨不停了……工程师在哪儿呢？……他们需要一个诚实的人，只要一个，一个了不起的人。”

这时，一个一直缩在后面的可怜孩子吮着大拇指羞怯地走上前来。他看上去脸色苍白，神情悲伤，脚步踉踉跄跄的，他的样子实在太惨了，甚至时间都产生了一瞬同情。

“就是你！”他宣布，“你看上去是一个非常可怜的人！”

他抬眼望望天，带着一种沮丧的神情，又说道：

“你会很短命。”

然后，一切又继续。被拒绝的孩子都情绪低落地回去做自己的事情了。被接受的孩子，都承受着其他人羡慕的目光。不过偶尔也会有意外，比如，注定要与不公正做斗争的那位英雄就拒绝降生。他拼命拉住自己的伙伴们，他的小伙伴们高声对时间喊：

“他不想去，先生！”

“是啊，我不想去，”小家伙哭着说，几乎用尽了所有的力气，“我宁愿不出生。”

“非常正确的决定！”泰泰尔想，他拥有很多常识，非常了解人间的生活是怎样的。

在人间，人们总是会无故地遭受打击。而当人们真正犯错时，惩罚则肯定会落在无辜的人身上。

“要是我，我也不想去过他的生活，”我们的朋友自言自语，“我宁愿去寻找青鸟，天天找都行。”

与此同时，与不公做斗争的小英雄几乎被时间先生吓掉了魂，抽泣着走了。

这是最令人激动的时刻。孩子们在大厅里跑来跑去，那些要离开的孩子忙着打包自己的发明，而留下来的则问个不停：

“你会给我写信吗？”

“他们说不能写。”

“噢，试试吧，就试一下吧。”

“把我的想法发布出来！”

“再见，吉恩……再见，皮埃尔！”

“有没有忘记带东西？”

“不要忘了你的想法！”

“如果好玩的话要想法子告诉我们啊！”

“够了，够了！”时间用洪亮的声音咆哮道，他摇晃着巨大的钥匙和可怕的镰刀，“够了！起锚了……”

孩子们爬上了扬着美丽的丝绸白帆的金船，向留下来的小朋友们挥着手，当看到远处的人间，他们都高兴地呐喊出来：

“人间！人间！……我看到了！……”

“多亮啊！”

“多大啊！”

就在这时，响起了一首歌，仿佛从深渊中传来的一般，那是一首从远方传来的饱含着喜悦和期待的歌。

光微笑着聆听着，看到泰泰尔脸上惊奇的神色，弯下腰对他说：

“这是迎接他们的妈妈的歌声。”

就在这时，刚刚关上门的时间看到了我们的朋友，他挥动着镰刀，愤怒地向他们冲了过来。

“快跑！”光说，“快跑！带上青鸟，泰泰尔，你和麦泰尔走在我前面。”

她将一只藏在斗篷下面的鸟塞到男孩怀里，然后整个人熠熠发光，伸开双臂，将她那绚丽的薄纱展开，保护着孩子们躲开时间的攻击。

他们就这样穿过了好几道绿松石和蓝宝石的走廊。那里真的非常漂亮，但是他们是在未来国度，时间是这里的主人，他们勇敢地面对了他的愤怒，也必须要逃离他的愤怒。

麦泰尔非常害怕，泰泰尔紧张地回头看向光。

“别害怕，”光说，“自从世界之始，我就是时间唯一尊敬的人，你们照顾好青鸟就行。它多漂亮啊！纯粹的青色啊！”

一想到青鸟男孩就狂喜不已。他感觉到这珍贵的鸟儿在自己怀中扑打着翅膀。他的手都不敢去按压它柔软而温暖的翅膀，他的心正贴着它的心一起跳动。这一次，他抓住了青鸟！什么也别想伤害它，因为这是光亲手给他的。等他回到家，这是多么盛大的凯旋啊！

他满心欢喜，都不知道自己该往哪里走。他的喜悦在他头脑中高声唱着凯歌，令他头晕目眩，他骄傲得几乎要疯了。唉，不幸的是，他因此失去了自己的冷静和理智！就在他们要跨出宫殿门槛的时候，一阵狂风席卷了门厅，吹起了光的纱巾，将两个孩子暴露在一直紧追在后的时间眼前。时间一声怒吼，将镰刀抛向了泰泰尔，泰泰尔吓得尖叫起来。光挡住了攻击，宫殿的大门在他们身后砰地关上，他们得救了！……但是，哎呀，泰泰尔刚才被吓到了，松开了手臂，透过泪水他看到未来国度的那只鸟儿在他们头顶高高地盘旋，它如梦的翅膀如此蔚蓝，如此轻盈、透明，和蔚蓝的天空融为一体，很快，泰泰尔就分辨不出来了……

(1) 指复活节前的星期天。





第六章　光的庙宇


泰泰尔在未来国度一直过得非常开心，他看到了很多神奇的东西，结识了千万个小伙伴，然后没有经历一点儿痛苦和麻烦便发现青鸟以最神奇的方式出现在了他的怀中。他从来都没有想过任何比它更加漂亮，颜色更青、更璀璨的小生命。他似乎依然能够感觉到它在他的胸前鼓翼，泰泰尔紧紧抱着胳膊，就像是青鸟还在他怀里。

唉，它已经如同幻梦一般消失了。

他和光手拉手走着，心中悲伤地想着这件令人失望的事情。他们回到光的庙宇，来到关着动物和物品的地窖。他们看到的是一幕什么样的景象啊！这些可怜虫一直吃吃喝喝，现在全都东倒西歪地醉倒在地板上。泰罗也失去了应有的体面，他在桌子底下翻来滚去，像一只海豚一样打着呼噜。他的直觉依然在，听到开门的声音仍支棱起了耳朵。他睁开了一只眼睛，不过他喝得太多，视线模糊，尽管看到了小主人，也没有认出来。他费了一番力气站起身，转了好几圈，然后又满足地咕噜了一声摔倒在地上睡着了。

面包和其他人的情形也同样糟糕。只有猫是个例外，她优雅地坐在一个大理石和黄金做成的长椅上，看上去十分清醒。她敏捷地跳到地上，笑着走向泰泰尔。

“我一直期待着能再见到你们呢，”她说，“在这些粗俗的人中间，我真的非常不开心。他们一上来就喝光了所有的酒，然后便开始大喊大叫、唱歌跳舞、吵架打斗，声音吵死了，最后他们终于醉得睡着了，我真是非常庆幸。”

孩子们热情地夸赞了她的良好表现。实际上，这并不是因为她有什么美德，只是因为她喝不了任何比牛奶烈的东西。但是我们很少会在我们该受到表扬时得到表扬，而在我们并不值得被表扬时，却会得到。

在亲热地吻了孩子们之后，泰莱特请光给她行一个方便。

“我太难受了，”她低声诉苦，“让我出去走走吧，让我自己待一会儿比较好。”

光丝毫没有怀疑，就表示了同意。猫立刻将斗篷披在身上，把帽子端正地戴好，将灰色的软皮靴子拉到膝盖上面，打开门，连跑带跳地进了森林。过一会儿，我们就知道狡诈的泰莱特这么开心是去了哪里，她在暗中谋划的又是多么可怕的阴谋。

就像几天前一样，孩子们和光在一间镶满了钻石的大房间内一同用餐。仆人们笑着在他们身边忙碌，端来了美味的饭菜和蛋糕。

吃过饭后，我们的小朋友就打起了哈欠。经历了这一番冒险之后，他们很早就困了。光非常慈爱、非常周到，让他们的生活就像是在人间的时候一样。为了不改变他们的习惯而影响到他们的健康，她将他们的小床安排在了庙宇的一个如同暗夜一般的黑暗的地方。

他们穿过了几个房间才到达他们的睡房。一路上，他们见到了所有人类知道的光和现在还不知道的光。

他们看到了很多间由大理石建造的大而奢华的房间，屋内的光白炽而强烈，孩子们都觉得目眩。

“这是富人之光，”光对泰泰尔说，“你看这有多危险，这样的光线没有给柔和的色调留一丝空间，在其中生活太久的话，就有失明的风险。”

她催促他们快些走，这样他们就可以到柔和的穷人之光中休息一下眼睛了。到了穷人之光中，孩子们突然觉得像是回到了他们父母的小屋中，那里一切都非常简朴而平和。微弱的光线纯粹而澄净，但总是摇曳不定，似乎一口气就能将其吹灭。

接着，他们来到了美丽的诗人之光的地界，他们真的无比喜欢这里，因为诗人之光色彩斑斓，如同彩虹，当你从光线中穿行的时候，你会看到可爱的图片、可爱的鲜花、可爱的玩具，但这些东西看得见，却无法抓住。两个孩子开心地笑闹着，追逐着飞鸟和蝴蝶，但是所有东西都一触即散。

“啊，我从来没有……”泰泰尔气喘吁吁地跑到光身边，“这简直令人无法相信！我不明白！”

“你以后会明白的，”光回答，“如果你能真正地明白了，你就会在看到青鸟的时候认出它来，只有极少数的人才能做到这一点。”

离开诗人之光的领域后，我们的朋友到了学者之光的地界，那里是已知之光和未知之光的交界处。

“咱们走吧，”泰泰尔说，“这里很无聊。”

说实话，他是有点儿害怕的，因为他们身处一长排冷硬而令人生畏的拱门之间，每时每刻，都有令人目眩的闪电在拱门上投下道道亮纹，每一次闪光，你都会看到还没有命名的奇特事物。

走过这些拱门，他们来到了人类未知之光的地界。尽管泰泰尔已经困得快要睁不开眼睛了，依然不由自主地欣赏着有紫罗兰色光柱的大厅和发散着红色光线的走廊。紫罗兰色的光柱是一种极深的紫色，而红色光线则是一种极浅的红色，两种光线都很难看清。

最后，他们来到了黑光的世界，这里有着柔和的黑色光线，人们将这种光称作黑暗，因为人类的眼睛没有办法看到这样的光线。在这里，孩子们很快便在两张软软的云床上陷入了梦乡。





第七章　墓园


孩子们没去探险的时候，便在光的辖界内玩耍，这对他们来说是最好的享受，因为庙宇周围的花园和乡野像金银建造的大厅和走廊一样奇妙。

有些植物的叶子宽大而结实，孩子们可以躺在上面，一阵微风吹过，叶片摇晃起来，他们就像是躺在吊床中一般。这里始终都是夏天，也没有一刻会被黑夜笼罩。但是随着时间变化，光线的色彩都是不同的，这里分为粉色时刻、白色时刻、蓝色时刻、紫色时刻、绿色时刻和黄色时刻。花儿、水果、小鸟、蝴蝶和各种气息会随着时间颜色的变化而变化，引得泰泰尔和麦泰尔连连惊奇。他们想要什么玩具，就能心想事成。玩累了之后，他们便伸展四肢躺在蜥蜴的背上，这里的蜥蜴的身体都又长又宽，仿佛小船一样，它们绕着花园小径飞奔，踩在如同糖一样又白又好吃的沙子上。孩子们渴了，水就会把她的头发甩入巨大的花朵当中，孩子们便从百合花、郁金香、牵牛花中喝水。如果饿了，他们就会摘下有光的味道的闪闪发亮的水果，那些水果甜美多汁，像阳光一样闪耀。

在灌木丛中，还有一个白色的大理石池塘，那个池塘拥有一种魔力，当人们望向它时，清澈的池水反映出来的，不是人的面孔，而是人的灵魂。

“这真是荒唐的发明。”猫说，她拒绝靠近那片池塘。

亲爱的小读者们，你们就像我一样了解她的想法，因此对她的这种抗拒丝毫都不会惊讶。同样，你们也非常理解为什么我们忠实的泰罗并不害怕去池塘喝水解渴，他无须害怕展示自己的思想，因为他是唯一一个灵魂从未发生变化的生灵。亲爱的小狗心里想的只有爱、善良和奉献。

泰泰尔弯身看向那面魔镜的时候，几乎总能看到一只美丽的青鸟，因为找到青鸟就是他的全部愿望。然后，他跑去找光，恳求道：

“请告诉我青鸟在哪里！……你什么都知道，请告诉我到哪里去找它。”

但是，光以一种非常神秘的语调回答：

“我什么也不能告诉你，你必须自己去寻找。”她吻了吻泰泰尔，又说道，“振作起来，每经历一次考验，你都离青鸟又近了一些。”

终于有一天，光对泰泰尔说：

“我收到了一条仙女贝丽露娜传来的消息，她说青鸟可能藏在墓园中……看起来，墓园中的一个死者将青鸟关在了自己的墓穴里……”

“我们该怎么办？”泰泰尔问。

“很简单，午夜时，你转动钻石，然后你就会看到那些死去的人从地下出来。”

听到这些话，牛奶、水、面包和糖都害怕地尖叫起来，他们都被吓得牙齿咯咯作响。

“别理会他们，”光悄声对泰泰尔说，“他们都害怕死人。”

“我不害怕！”火跳着说，“我曾经经常烧毁那些死人，那可比现在的日子有意思多了。”

“哦，我觉得我要晕倒了。”牛奶哀号着。

“我不害怕。”狗的四肢都在打颤，“但如果你要逃跑……我也会逃跑的……而且非常乐意……”

猫捋着她的胡须坐在一边。

“我知道那是怎么回事。”她用她惯常的神秘口吻说。

“安静，”光说，“仙女给了明确的指令。你们和我都要留在墓园大门那里，两个孩子自己进去。”

泰泰尔满心不快。他问道：

“你不和我们一起去吗？”

“是的，我不去，”光说，“我和你们同行的时间还未到。光不能够进入死者的地界。另外，那里也没有什么好怕的，我就在不远处，那些爱我的人和我爱的人总是能够再次找到我……”

她的话还没有说完，孩子们身边的一切都发生了变化。壮丽的庙宇、迷人的花朵、绚烂的花园全都消失不见了，化作了一个沐浴着柔和月光的凄凉的乡村墓地。在孩子们身边，有许多坟墓，长着青草的土包，木头十字架和墓碑。泰泰尔和麦泰尔的心一下子就被恐惧占领了，他们紧紧地拥抱住彼此。

“我害怕！”麦泰尔说。

“我从来都不害怕！”泰泰尔结结巴巴地说，他因为恐惧而颤抖，却不想承认。

“你说，”麦泰尔问，“死者邪恶吗？”

“不邪恶，”泰泰尔说，“他们不是活的……”

“你见过吗？”

“见过，见过一次，那是很久之前了，当时我还很小……”

“他是什么样的？”

“非常白，非常安静，非常冷漠，不说话……”

“我们要去见他们吗？”

听到这个问题，泰泰尔抖了一下，努力让自己的声音不发颤，但是并不成功，他答道：

“当然啦，光是这么说的啊！”

“死去的人在哪里？”麦泰尔问。

泰泰尔恐惧地打量了一下四周，两个孩子自从被独自留下之后就一步都没敢动过。

“那些死人就在这里，”他说，“在那些草下面，或是在那些大石头下面。”

“那些是他们房子的大门吗？”麦泰尔指着墓碑问道。

“是的。”

“天气好的时候他们会出来吗？”

“他们只在晚上出来。”

“为什么呀？”

“因为他们只穿着睡衣。”

“下雨的时候他们会出来吗？”

“下雨的时候他们会留在家里。”

“他们家里舒服吗？”

“据说非常狭窄。”

“他们中有小孩子吗？”

“啊，有，所有死去的人都在那里。”

“他们吃什么？”

泰泰尔没有立刻回答，而是停下来思考了一会儿。他觉得自己是麦泰尔的哥哥，便有责任什么都懂，但是麦泰尔的问题经常会难住他。这时，他意识到，由于死者是生活在地下的，那么他们就几乎吃不到任何地面上的东西，于是他十分肯定地回答：

“他们吃植物的根！”

麦泰尔得到了问题的答案，十分满意，然后又问出了那个占据她的小脑袋瓜的重大问题。

“我们会见到他们吗？”她问。

“当然啦，”泰泰尔说，“我转动这颗钻石后，我们就能看到一切。”

“那他们会说些什么呢？”

泰泰尔开始不耐烦了，答道：

“他们什么都不会说，因为他们不说话。”

“他们为什么不说话？”麦泰尔问。

“因为他们没什么要说的。”泰泰尔越来越烦躁，脑袋越来越乱。

“为什么他们没有什么要说的？”

这一次，哥哥失去了所有的耐心。他耸了耸肩，推了麦泰尔一下，生气地喊道：

“你真是个烦人精！”

麦泰尔十分难过，而且困惑不解。她吮了吮大拇指，决定再也不说一句话了，因为哥哥对她的态度实在太糟糕了。但是一阵风吹过，树叶沙沙作响，突然唤醒了孩子们的恐惧和孤寂。他们又紧紧地抱住彼此，开始说话，以打破那可怕的沉寂。

“你什么时候会转动钻石？”麦泰尔问。

“你也听到啦，光说我要等到午夜时分，因为那对死者造成的打扰最少，那个时候正是他们出来透风的时间……”

“还没到午夜吗？”

泰泰尔扭头看了看，看到了教堂的钟楼，他几乎没有力气回答，因为时钟的指针正指向午夜。

“听！”他结结巴巴地说，“听，就要鸣钟了……响了！你听到了吗？”

钟声响了。

这时，麦泰尔已经怕得难以自控了，开始跺着脚不停地叫喊：

“我想离开这里！……我想离开这里！……”

泰泰尔尽管也害怕得僵住了，但是还能说出这样的话：

“现在不行……我要转动钻石了……”

“不，不，不！”麦泰尔叫道，“我太害怕了，哥哥！……你别那么做！……我要离开这里！”

泰泰尔想要抬起手，但却根本没有办法触碰到钻石。麦泰尔紧紧地抓着他，把全部的重量都压在了哥哥的胳膊上，高声尖叫着：

“我不想见死人！……他们会很可怕的！……我不可能做到！……我太害怕了！”

可怜的泰泰尔其实和麦泰尔一样害怕，但是，每经历一次考验，他的意志力和勇气就会更强大一些，他在渐渐学会控制自己，什么都不能令他放弃自己的使命。第十一声钟声已经响起了。

“时间快过去了！”他叫道，“就是现在！”

他坚决地挣脱了麦泰尔的胳膊，转动了钻石……

接下来是一阵恐怖的静寂，然后两个孩子看到十字架晃动，坟丘张开了口，石板墓盖缓缓上升。

麦泰尔吓得把脸藏在泰泰尔的胸口。

“他们出来了！”她哭着说，“他们就在那里！……他们就在那里！”

恐惧已经超出了我们小勇士的承受能力。他闭上了眼睛，身子靠在旁边的一棵树上，这样才能坚持住不晕倒。他维持着那个姿势有一分钟，苦苦撑着，感觉那一分钟就像一个世纪那么漫长，他不敢动，不敢呼吸。然后他听到了鸟儿的叫声，一阵带着馨香的暖风吹拂着他的脸，他感到他的手上、脖子上都有着温煦的夏季艳阳带来的融融暖意。现在，他安下心来，但依然不敢相信这样的奇迹。他睁开眼睛，便立刻带着喜悦和赞美欢叫出声。

那些打开的坟墓中长出了千千万万绚丽的花朵，花儿四处蔓延，小径上，树上，草地上，都铺满了花；它们不停地向上长，向上长，似乎都触到了天空。那是完全绽放的玫瑰，展示着美丽的花心，神奇的金色的花心，散发出热烈、明亮的光线，把泰泰尔包裹在夏季的温暖之中。在玫瑰花周围，鸟儿欢唱，蜜蜂嗡鸣。

“我真不能相信！这不可能！”泰泰尔说，“那些坟墓和石头十字架呢？”

两个孩子惊叹不已，非常迷惑，他们手牵着手穿过墓园，其实这里已经看不到半点墓园的痕迹了，彻底变成了一个美丽的花园。经历过极度的恐惧之后看到这一切，他们真的非常高兴。他们曾经以为，会有丑陋的骷髅从土中出来追逐他们，露出狰狞的面孔，他们曾经想象了各种各样可怕的事情。而现在，真相就在眼前，他们发现，曾经听说的一切，都不过是彻头彻尾完全虚构的故事，死人并不存在这世上。他们也明白了一切并没有死亡，生命总是在继续，只是转换成了新的形式。凋谢的玫瑰洒落了花粉，促成了其他玫瑰的新生，零落的花瓣令空气也变得芬芳起来。当繁花落尽时，果实随之结出。丑陋的毛毛虫最终化作美丽的蝴蝶。一切都没有死亡，只是改变了模样……

美丽的鸟儿在泰泰尔和麦泰尔身边盘旋，其中并没有青鸟，不过两个孩子因为他们的新发现已经十分开心了，再无所求。他们怀着惊喜，不断地重复着：

“没有死亡！……没有死亡！”





第八章　森林


泰泰尔和麦泰尔一上床，光便吻了吻他们，然后立刻消失了，因为她不想她美丽的身体上射出的光线影响到他们的睡眠。

那时肯定是午夜前后，睡梦中的泰泰尔见到了蓝衣孩子们，这时，他感到有一个天鹅绒一样柔软的爪子轻抚着他的脸。他猛地一惊，有些害怕地坐起身，但是他很快便又安下心来，因为他看到的是他的朋友泰莱特的眼睛在黑暗中闪闪发光。

“嘘！”猫贴着他的耳朵说，“嘘！不要吵醒其他人。如果我们能偷偷溜出去，那今晚就能抓到青鸟。噢，我最亲爱的小主人，我冒着生命危险，制订了一个肯定能够实现愿望的计划！”

“但是，”男孩吻了吻泰莱特，“光很愿意帮助我们啊……另外，如果违背了她的意愿，我会很惭愧的。”

“如果你告诉她，”猫严厉地说，“那一切就都完蛋了，相信我，按照我说的做，今天是属于我们的。”

她这么说着，便开始急匆匆地给泰泰尔和麦泰尔穿衣服——麦泰尔是听到他们的声音醒来的，也要跟他们一起去。

“你不明白，”泰泰尔低声咕哝，“你还太小了，不知道我们在做的事情有多恶劣……”

但是奸诈的猫回应了他的话，说他之所以到现在还没有找到青鸟，全是光的错，因为她太亮了。如果孩子们自己去寻找，在黑暗中搜寻，很快就能找到所有能令人类幸福的青鸟。这个女骗子格外聪明，没多久，泰泰尔眼中原有的抗拒便消失了，变成了热切的渴望。泰莱特说的每一个字，都给他的行动提供了充足的借口，令他浮想联翩。他太容易受影响了，没有意志去对抗诡计，于是便被说服了，迈着坚定而雀跃的步子走出了光的庙宇。可怜的小家伙啊，如果他能够预见等待着他的可怕陷阱，那该有多好啊！

三个小伙伴出发了，他们要穿越沐浴在银白色月光下的田野。猫似乎非常兴奋，一路上说个不停，而且走得特别快，两个孩子几乎跟不上她。

“这一次，”她宣布，“我们要找到青鸟，我肯定能！我问过那片最古老的森林中的所有树了，他们都认识青鸟，因为它就躲藏在那些树中间。为了让大家都到那里，我还让兔子去村子里把重要的动物都召集来。”

不到一个小时，他们就到达了黑暗森林的边缘。然后，在路的一个拐弯处，他们看到远处有个人似乎正急匆匆地向他们走来。泰莱特弓起了背，她觉得这是她的宿敌。她因为愤怒而颤抖：他是不是又要来阻挠她的计划？他是不是猜到了她的秘密？他是不是会在最后一刻拯救孩子们的性命？

她向泰泰尔靠去，以她最甜蜜的声音低声对他说：

“那是我们忠实的朋友狗。但真的万分遗憾，因为他的出现会让我们无法实现目标。他和所有人的关系都不好，甚至和树木们都不和。一定要让他回去。”

“走开，你这个丑八怪！”泰泰尔向泰罗挥动着拳头。

亲爱的、诚实的老泰罗，之所以来到这里是因为他察觉到了猫的计划。听到这些话真的感到很受伤，他都要哭了。他一路跑来累得上气不接下气，什么回答都想不出来。

“走开，我跟你说，”泰泰尔说，“我们不想让你在这儿，就到这里吧……你这个讨厌鬼，走！……”

泰罗一直以来都温顺听话，如果是别的时候，他肯定就走了，但是他对主人的爱告诉他，这里发生的事情非常严重，他一动不动地站在那里。

“你能允许这样的违命吗？”猫对泰泰尔低语，“用你的手杖打他！”

泰泰尔听了猫的建议，打了狗。

“怎么样，这能让你学得更加听话！”泰泰尔说。

可怜的狗挨了打，哀号起来，但是他的自我牺牲精神非常强大，他勇敢地走到小主人身边，拉住他的胳膊，哭诉道：

“尽管你打了我，我也必须亲吻你。”

泰泰尔是个心地善良的小家伙，此时手足无措。猫咬着牙咒骂，就像只野兽一样。幸运的是，亲爱的小麦泰尔出面维护我们的朋友了。

“不，不，我想让他留下来，”她恳求道，“泰罗不在身边，我就感到害怕。”

时间很紧迫，他们必须做一个决定。

“我要找个别的办法来甩掉这个白痴！”猫心里想。然后，她以最礼貌的方式，扭头对狗说：“如果你能加入我们，我们真是太高兴了！”

他们走入大森林中，孩子们紧紧地贴在一起，猫和狗走在他们两侧。他们因为静寂和黑暗而心生敬畏，当听到猫说“我们到了！转动钻石！”时，他们都松了一口气。

这时，光开始在他们身边扩散，向他们展示出一幕奇景。他们正站在森林里一块面积很大的圆形空地中间，周围是非常非常古老的树木，高得似乎和天空连在了一起。宽宽的林荫路在暗绿色的森林中间勾勒出了一颗白色星星的形状。一切都平静、安宁，但是突然之间，树叶中传来一阵奇怪的颤动，树枝开始晃动伸展，就像人的胳膊一样。树根从覆盖着它们的泥土中拔出，聚拢到一起，形成了腿和脚的形状，站到了地面上。巨大的碎裂声划破长空。树木的树干都裂开了，释放出他们各自的灵魂，那些灵魂的外表都有些滑稽。

有的树魂缓缓地从他们的树干中走出来，还有的一下子蹦了出来，他们全都好奇地聚在我们的朋友身边。

健谈的杨树开始像个喜鹊一样叽叽喳喳地说：

“小人儿！我们能和他们说话！我们受够了沉寂了！……他们从哪里来的？……他们是谁？”

他就这么喋喋不休。

椴树是个快活的胖子，冷静地走上前来，嘴里叼着烟斗。打扮时髦、高傲自大的栗树推了推眼镜，盯着两个孩子。他穿着一件绿色的丝绸外套，上面绣着粉色和白色的花朵。他觉得这两个小家伙样子太寒酸了，嘲笑地扭开了头。

“他觉得自己是个大人物呢，因为他在城里住过！他看不起我们！”杨树很嫉妒他，嘴里冷嘲热讽。

“噢，天哪，噢，天哪！”柳树抽泣着说，他是个矮小的小可怜儿，脚上趿拉着一双对他来说有些过大的木鞋，“他们是来砍掉我的头和胳膊拿去当柴火的！”

泰泰尔不敢相信自己的眼睛。他一直不停地向猫询问：

“这是谁？……那又是谁？……”

泰莱特将树的灵魂一一介绍给他。

榆树是个喘气困难、大腹便便、脾气暴躁的矮子。山毛榉是个优雅而活泼的人。桦树那飘荡的白袍和透着不安的一举一动，让他看起来像是夜宫中的鬼魂。最高的一个是枞树，泰泰尔发现很难看清楚他瘦长身躯上方的面孔，但是他看起来非常温柔，也非常悲伤。而站在枞树旁边的柏树，穿着一袭黑衣，令泰泰尔非常害怕。

不过，到现在为止，还没有非常恐怖的事情发生。那些树很开心能够讲话，都聚在一起说个不停。我们的小朋友直接走过去问他们青鸟躲在哪里。就在这时，四周突然静了下来。所有的树都恭敬地弯身行礼，给一棵很老很老的橡树让路，这棵无比苍老的橡树身穿绣有苔藓和地衣的长袍。他一只手拄着一根手杖，另一只手搭在一棵年幼的橡树苗身上——这是他的向导，因为老橡树的眼睛已经瞎了。他长长的白胡子在风中飞扬。

“这是国王吧！”泰泰尔看到他戴着槲寄生做的王冠，自言自语道，“我要去问问他森林的秘密。”

他正要走上前去，却又停住了脚步，心中满是惊讶和狂喜：青鸟就在他面前呀，就栖息在老橡树的肩膀上。

“他有青鸟！”孩子欢叫，“快呀！快呀！把它给我！”

“别说话，闭嘴！”树们都吃了一惊，纷纷说道。

“脱帽行礼，泰泰尔，”猫说，“那可是橡树！”

可怜的孩子立刻笑着照办，他并不明白即将面临的危险。当橡树问他是不是樵夫泰尔的儿子时，他不假思索地回答说“是的，先生”。

听到这个回答，橡树愤怒得浑身发抖，开始了对泰尔爸爸的可怕控诉。

“就光说我的家族，”他说，“你父亲就杀死了我的六百个孩子、四百七十五个叔叔和阿姨、一千两百个表兄弟姐妹、三百八十个儿媳、一万两千个曾孙！”

他很恼怒，所以难免夸张，但是泰泰尔听着，丝毫也没有表示反对，只是非常礼貌地说：

“很抱歉打扰您，先生……猫对我说您能告诉我们青鸟在哪里。”

橡树年纪太大了，对人和动物的本性都已经非常了解了。他猜出这是猫设下的陷阱，胡子下面的脸露出了笑容，他非常高兴，他一直都期待着为整个森林复仇，因为人类一直都在奴役森林。

“这是为了仙女贝丽露娜的小女儿找的，她病得很厉害。”男孩接着说。

“够了！”老橡树打断了他的话，“我还没听动物的意见呢……他们在哪里？……这问题不仅关系到我们，也关系到他们……这么重大的事情，我们树族决不独自承担这个责任。”

“他们来了！”枞树说，他能越过所有树的树顶看出去，“兔子打头，别的动物跟着……我可以看到马、公牛、母牛、狼、绵羊、猪、山羊、熊……”

所有动物都到了，他们用后腿走路，穿着人类的衣服。他们在树的中间站成了一个圈子，非常严肃。只有不知轻重的山羊例外，他在林荫径上一蹦一跳地走着。还有猪想在刚刚离开土地的树根下面找些美味的松露吃。

“人都到齐了吗？”橡树问。

“母鸡不能丢下她的蛋，”兔子说，“大野兔出去玩了，公鹿犄角疼，还长了鸡眼，狐狸病了——这是医生的证明，鹅听不明白为什么要来这里，火鸡发起了脾气……”

“看啊！”泰泰尔对麦泰尔低语，“他们多好玩啊！他们就像是圣诞节的时候有钱孩子放在橱窗中的玩具。”

他们觉得最好笑的就是兔子了，他大大的耳朵上顶着一顶三角帽，身上穿着蓝色的绣花外套，身前挂着一面鼓。

这时，橡树开始向他的这些树兄弟以及动物朋友解释当前的情况。狡诈的泰莱特就是要利用他们对人类的仇恨。

“你们面前的这个孩子，”橡树说，“因为一个从大地之母那里偷来的法宝，有可能要抢占我们的青鸟，从而掌握我们自生命之初就保守的秘密……我们都非常了解人类，十分清楚一旦他们掌握了这个秘密，会怎么对待我们……此刻若有半分犹豫，都是愚蠢的，也是可耻的……这是性命攸关的时刻，在一切还来得及的时候，必须杀死这个孩子……”

“他在说什么？”泰泰尔说，他没有明白老橡树要干什么。

狗绕着橡树跑来跑去，露出他的獠牙。

“你看到我的牙齿了吗，你这个老瘸子？”他咆哮道。

“他在辱骂橡树！”山毛榉愤愤不平地说。

“把他赶走！”橡树恼怒地说，“他是个叛徒！”

“我跟你们说什么了？”猫轻声对泰泰尔说，“我会处理一切的……但是一定要把他赶走。”

“你走开！”泰泰尔对狗说。

“让我来撕破这个有痛风病的老乞丐的苔藓拖鞋！”泰罗乞求道。

泰泰尔想要阻止他，但是没有成功。泰罗明白当前的危险所在，简直怒不可遏，他本来可以成功拯救他的小主人，只可惜猫突然灵机一动，召唤一直站在旁边的常春藤来阻挡。狗像个疯子一样跳来跳去，咒骂所有人。他对着常春藤咆哮道：

“来啊，你敢不敢啊，你这团老乱麻，来啊！”

其他人都愤愤不平。橡树因为自己的权威遭到蔑视而气得脸都灰了。树木们和动物们也都十分生气，但他们都是胆小鬼，没有一个人敢出言反驳。如果狗继续下去，肯定能够把所有人都震住。只是泰泰尔严厉地威胁他，泰罗突然便臣服于自己顺从的天性，卧在了主人的脚下。因此，当我们不加区分的时候，美德会被当成错误对待。

从那时候开始，孩子们就处于不利的地位了。常春藤困住了可怜的狗，狗被带到了栗树的后面，捆在了他最大的根上。

“现在，”老橡树声如惊雷，“我们可以安静地讨论了……这是我们第一次有机会来审判人类！我觉得，在经历了我们遭遇的那些暴行和不公之后，对他的判决必然毫无争议……”

众人异口同声道：

“死刑！死刑！死刑！”

起初，可怜的孩子并不明白降临到他们身上的厄运，因为树木和动物们更习惯用他们自己的语言来交谈，他们说的话并不是那么明白易懂。另外，天真的孩子们从来都没有想象过这样的残酷局面！

“他们怎么了？”男孩问，“他们不高兴了吗？”

“别紧张，”猫说，“他们就是有点儿恼怒，因为春天来得迟了……”

她继续在泰泰尔耳边低语，想要分散他的注意力，让他无法关注正在发生的事情。

当这个轻信的小男孩听着她的谎言的时候，其他人则在讨论以哪种方式行刑是最实用、风险最小的。公牛建议用牛角重重一顶；山毛榉表示愿意提供自己最高的枝条将两个孩子吊死；而常春藤已经编出了一个套索！枞树愿意献出四块板材做棺材，柏树则同意提供一块永久的墓地。

“现在最简单的方法，”柳树轻声说，“就是将他们淹死在我旁边的一条河里。”

猪咬着牙哼哼着说：

“在我看来，最重要的事情应该是吃掉那个小女孩，她应该很鲜嫩……”

“安静！”橡树吼道，“我们必须决定，我们中的哪一个有荣幸发出第一击！”

“荣耀属于你，我们的国王！”枞树说。

“唉，我太老了！”老橡树回答，“我已经瞎了，站也站不稳了！而你，四季常青的兄弟，请接受荣耀，代替我，发出那决定性的一击，令我们获得自由！”

但是枞树托词说，他已准备享受埋葬两个死者的乐趣，不想引起过多的嫉妒，婉拒了这项荣誉。他推举山毛榉，因为他的枝条最硬。

“这可不行，”山毛榉说，“大家都知道的，我被虫子蛀了！还是问问榆树和柏树吧！”

听到这话，榆树开始呻吟起来，说昨晚有一只鼹鼠扭伤了他的大脚趾，他几乎都站不直身子。柏树也为自己找了理由，杨树说自己病了，烧得浑身颤抖。老橡树勃然大怒。

“你们全都害怕人类！”他指责说，“即便是这些无人保护、没有武装的小孩子，你们也害怕！……好吧，我自己上，我又老又盲，虚弱不堪，但我要对付我们的宿敌！……他在哪里呢？……”

他用手杖探索着路，向泰泰尔移动，一边走一边咆哮。

就在这几分钟中，我们的小朋友开始感到恐惧。猫突然离开了，说她想去安抚一下众人的激动情绪，然后就再也没有回来。麦泰尔靠着泰泰尔颤抖个不停。在这些可怕的人中间，他已经感受到了他们的愤怒，他觉得自己很孤单，很压抑。当他看到老橡树带着危险的气息向他靠近时，他拔出了小折刀，像个大人一样反抗。

“那个老家伙，拿着大棍子，是不是来对付我的啊？”他叫道。

一看到那把刀——人类不可抗拒的武器，所有的树木都吓得颤抖起来，匆匆地奔向老橡树，想把他拉回来。一番撕扯，老国王因年老体衰，丢下了手杖。

“真丢人啊！”他喊道，“我们可真是丢人啊！让动物们来解救我们吧！”

动物们一直在等这一刻！他们全都想要复仇。幸运的是，他们热切的渴望引发了一场混战，结果却拖延了对孩子们的这场谋杀。

麦泰尔放声尖叫。

“别害怕，”泰泰尔尽全力去保护着妹妹说，“我有刀。”

“小家伙还宁死不屈呢！”公鸡说。

“我要先吃那一个。”猪贪婪地看着麦泰尔。

“我对你们做过什么吗？”泰泰尔问。

“什么也没有，我的小人儿，”绵羊说，“不过是吃了我的一个小弟弟，两个姐妹，三个叔叔，还有阿姨，祖父，祖母……等你倒下，你就会发现我也是有牙齿的……”

羊和马都是非常怯懦的胆小鬼，他们全在等着两个孩子被打倒，然后再去分享胜利。

他们说着的时候，狼和熊已经阴险地从后方发动了攻击，扑向泰泰尔，将他推倒在地。这真是可怕的时刻。所有的动物，都盯着倒在地上的泰泰尔，想要抓住他。男孩支撑着单膝跪起，挥舞着刀子。麦泰尔痛苦地大叫着。而雪上加霜的是，突然间一切都被黑暗笼罩了。

泰泰尔疯狂地呼喊求助，“救命啊！救命啊！泰罗！泰罗！……来救救我们啊！……泰莱特在哪儿呢？……快来人啊！快来救命啊！……”

猫的声音从远方传来，她狡猾地躲到了大家都看不见的地方。

“我过不去！”她哀号着说，“我受伤了。”

这个时候，勇敢的小泰泰尔一直在奋力抵抗，但是他以一敌众，觉得自己就要死于非命了，于是用颤抖的声音又一次喊道：

“救命！……泰罗！泰罗！……我撑不住了！……他们人太多了！……熊！……猪！……狼！枞树！山毛榉！……泰罗！泰罗！……”

这时，狗冲了过来，他拖着被挣开的绳索，一路挤开树木和动物们，挡到了小主人的前面，他狂怒地维护着自己的主人。

“我来了，我的小上帝！不要怕！揍他们！我知道该如何运用我的牙齿！”

所有的树木和动物都高声咆哮起来：

“叛徒！……白痴！……背叛者！……恶棍！……傻子！……小人！……躲开！……他死定了！……你投降吧！……”

狗继续战斗。

“决不！决不！我一个人对抗你们所有人！……决不投降！决不投降！我要忠于我的上帝，忠于最好最伟大的人！……小心，我的小主人，熊过来了！……注意公牛啊！”狗说。

泰泰尔奋力自卫，但有些体力不支。

“我完了，泰罗！是榆树打的！我的手流血了！”他跌倒在地上，“不，我再也撑不住了。”

“他们来了！”狗说，“我听到有人来了！……我们得救了！是光！……得救了！得救了！……看啊，他们害怕了，他们撤退了！……得救了，我的小国王！……”

是的，光正向他们走来，随着她一步步靠近，晨光笼罩了森林，这里变得亮如白昼。

“怎么了？……发生什么事了？”她问道，看到孩子们和亲爱的泰罗身上满是伤口和瘀青，她十分吃惊，“哎呀，我可怜的孩子，你不知道吗？快点转动钻石啊！”

泰泰尔赶忙照办，一瞬间，所有树的灵魂都匆匆回到了树干里面，树干随之封闭。动物的灵魂全都消失不见了，只剩下远处一只牛和一只羊在安闲地吃草。森林又变得无害了，泰泰尔吃惊地看着四周。

“没事了，”泰泰尔说，“但要不是狗……要是我没有带着我的刀……”

光觉得泰泰尔已经受到了惩罚，没有再责怪他。另外她因为泰泰尔经历的恐怖危险也非常不安。

泰泰尔、麦泰尔和狗很开心能够再次平安，欣喜地吻着彼此。他们笑着数自己身上的伤口，那些伤口并不太严重。

只有泰莱特大惊小怪。

“狗弄伤了我的爪子！”她喵喵地叫着。

泰罗觉得自己应该狠狠咬她一口才对。

“别介意，”泰罗说，“又掉不了！”

“别惹她了，可以吗，你这个丑陋的小野兽！”麦泰尔说。

经历了这段冒险，我们的朋友返回光的神庙休息。泰泰尔很懊悔自己不听光的话擅自行动，没有勇气提他瞥到过的青鸟。光柔声对孩子们说：

“希望你们能从此记住这次教训，亲爱的孩子们，在这个世界上，人要单独地对抗一切。千万不要忘了。”





第九章　道别


自从孩子们踏上寻找青鸟的旅程，几个星期过去了，转眼几个月过去了。分别的时刻就在眼前。最近，光非常悲伤，她已经在伤心地数日子了，她没有对动物和物品说什么，他们都不知道即将降临到他们身上的不幸。

我们最后一次见到他们的那天，他们都在庙宇的花园里。光站在一个大理石露台上望着他们，泰泰尔和麦泰尔在她身边睡着。在过去的十二个月中发生了很多事情，但是动物和物品们智慧不足，不能够掌控生活，所以他们没有什么进步，反而倒退了。面包饱食终日，现在胖得都走不动路了。牛奶如同以往一样乐于助人，正吃力地推着坐在轮椅中的面包走动。火的暴脾气让他和每个人都发生过争吵，所以变得非常孤立，非常不开心。水自己没有什么主见，她屈服在糖的甜蜜攻势下，和糖结婚了。糖在婚后总是一副可怜兮兮的模样，这个可怜的家伙都瘦得没形了，一天天地在明显瘦下去，而且比从前更愚蠢了；而水在结婚后，失去了她最迷人的优点——单纯。猫一如既往，喜欢撒谎。我们亲爱的朋友泰罗则从没有停止过对猫的仇恨。

“可怜的东西！”光沉思着，叹了口气，“他们虽获得了生命，却没有收获什么。他们四处旅行，却丝毫没有看到我平和的庙宇中发生的那些奇迹。他们不是互相争吵，就是暴饮暴食，直到把自己吃病了。他们都太愚蠢了，都没有办法享受他们的幸福，不久，他们就会第一次认识到幸福是什么，但这已经是他们要失去幸福的时刻了……”

就在这个时候，一只十分漂亮的银翼鸽子落到了她的膝盖上。鸽子的脖子上套着一个祖母绿的项圈，扣环上拴着一张纸条。这只鸽子是仙女贝丽露娜的信使。光打开信，读到了下面的这些字：“记住这一年结束了。”

光站起身，挥动魔杖，一切都消失了。

几秒钟后，所有人都集合在了一道高墙之外，高墙上有一道小门。第一缕晨曦在树梢上闪耀。这时，泰泰尔和麦泰尔在光慈爱的怀抱中醒了过来，他们揉了揉眼睛，惊讶地看着周围。

“怎么了？”光问泰泰尔，“你不认识这道墙和这扇小门了吗？”

睡意蒙眬的男孩摇了摇头，他什么都不记得。光便帮助他回忆。

“这道墙，”她说，“环绕着一座房子，我们在一年前的这个晚上离开了那座房子……”

“就在一年前？……哎呀，那么……”泰泰尔欢快地拍着手，跑到门边，“妈妈肯定就在里面！……我想要立刻就亲亲她，立刻就亲，立刻！”

但是光拦住了他。她说现在还太早了，妈妈和爸爸还在睡着呢，泰泰尔肯定不想把他们吓醒了。

“另外，”她又说，“门只有到了时间才会开。”

“什么时间？”男孩问。

“分别的时间。”光悲伤地回答。

“什么？”泰泰尔非常沮丧，“你要离开我们了吗？”

“我必须走了，”光说，“这一年结束了。仙女会回来找你们要青鸟。”

“但是我没有找到青鸟。”泰泰尔叫道，“回忆之地的青鸟变成了漆黑色；未来国度的青鸟飞走了；夜宫的青鸟死掉了；墓园的鸟儿并不是青色的；而森林里面的青鸟，我没有抓住！仙女会生气吗？她会说什么呢？”

“没关系，亲爱的，”光说，“你已经尽力了，尽管你没有找到青鸟，但按照你表现出的善良、勇敢和胆量，你配得上找青鸟这个任务。”

光说这些话的时候，脸上闪耀着幸福的光芒，因为她知道，配得上找青鸟，和找到了青鸟，几乎是一样的，但是她不能够这么说，因为这是一个美丽的谜，泰泰尔必须自己去解开。她转头看向站在角落里啜泣的动物和物品们，让他们过来亲吻孩子。

面包立刻把鸟笼放在泰泰尔的脚下，开始发表演说：

“谨代表所有人，我渴望能有幸……”

“你可代表不了我！”火叫道。

“肃静！”水大声说。

“我们自己有舌头！”火咆哮。

“是啊！是啊！”糖尖叫，他知道自己的生命到了尽头，一直吻着水，在众人面前一点点地溶化。

可怜的面包想要大声说话，盖过这一片喧嚣，却徒劳无功。光不得不出面干预，让大家安静下来。这时，面包说出了他最后的话。

“我要离开你们了，”他抽泣着说，“我就要离开你们了，我亲爱的孩子们，你们不会再见到拥有生命的我了。你们的眼睛将再也看不到物品们内在的生命了。但是我一直都在，在面包烤盘中，在架子上，在桌子上，在汤旁边，如果允许的话，我得说，我是最忠实的伙伴，是人类最古老的朋友……”

“好吧，那我呢？”火吼道，他十分愤怒。

“肃静！”光说，“时间就要过去了……抓紧时间和孩子们道别……”

火匆匆向前，握住孩子们的手，挨个亲吻两个孩子，非常猛烈，两个孩子都痛苦地尖叫起来：

“啊！啊！……他烧着我了！……”

“啊！啊！……他把我鼻子烧焦了！……”

“让我来亲吻一下你们的伤口，帮你们治愈。”水温柔地走到了孩子们跟前。

火抓住机会挑拨。

“小心，”他说，“你们会被弄得浑身湿漉漉的。”

“我充满爱意，充满温柔，”水说，“我对人类非常友好……”

“那些被你淹死的人是怎么回事？”火问。

但是水假装没有听到。

“请爱护井水，倾听溪流的声音，”她说，“我一直都在。傍晚当你们坐在泉水边时，请注意聆听她们想要说的话……”

这时，她不得不停下来，因为她的眼泪又像瀑布一样从眼睛里涌了出来，在她身边四处泛滥。但她又继续说了下去：

“当你们看到水瓶的时候，就想到我……我就在水罐中，在水壶中，在水池中，在水龙头中……”

糖一瘸一拐地走上前来，他几乎都没有办法自己站着了。他用一种饱含深情的声音说了一些悲伤的话，然后停了下来，他说，眼泪不太适合他的本性。

“薄荷硬糖(1)！”面包叫道。

“糖渍李子！棒棒糖！太妃糖！”火叫道。

所有人都大笑起来，只有两个孩子依然非常悲伤。

“泰莱特和泰罗去了哪里？”我们的主人公问。

就在这个时候，猫跑了过来，样子狼狈极了：她的毛发都竖立着，乱蓬蓬的；她的衣服七零八落；她握着一块手帕遮着脸颊，好像正在犯牙疼一般。她发出刺耳的呻吟声。狗正紧紧地追在她身后，对她撕咬踢打。其他人跑过去将他们隔开，但是两个宿仇依然盯着对方，咒骂不停。猫指责狗拽她的尾巴，在她的食物里面放锡钉，还攻击她。狗只是咆哮着，倒是什么都没有否认。

“你尝到厉害了吧！”他不停地说，“你尝到厉害了吧，还没有完呢！”

但是，突然间，他住口了，开始亢奋地喘起了粗气。大家可以看到他的舌头变得非常白。因为光告诉他，去吻孩子们，这是最后一次了。

“最后一次？”可怜的泰罗结结巴巴地问，“我们要和这两个可怜的孩子分开了？”

他实在太悲伤了，几乎失去了理解事情的能力。

“是的，”光说，“你们知道，那个时刻就要到来了……我们都要回归沉寂了……”

狗突然意识到了自己的不幸命运，发出了痛彻心扉的绝望咆哮声，扑到孩子们身上，疯狂地亲吻他们。

“不要！不要！”他哭着说，“我不接受！……我不接受！……我要一直能讲话！……我会非常听话的……你们留着我吧，我可以学习怎么读书，怎么写字，怎么玩骨牌！……我会一直干干净净的……我再也不会从厨房偷东西了……”

他跪在两个孩子面前，抽泣着，恳求着。泰泰尔满眼都是泪水，什么都没有说。亲爱的泰罗想到了一个绝佳的主意：他跑到猫跟前，笑着去吻她。他本来想要微笑，但笑得龇牙咧嘴，有些狰狞。泰莱特可没有自我牺牲的精神，立刻向后一跳，躲到了麦泰尔的身边。麦泰尔天真地说：

“泰莱特，就差你一个还没有吻我们呢。”

猫装腔作势地说：

“孩子们，我当然爱着你们两个，因为你们也值得我爱。”

这时出现了一阵沉默。

“现在，”光说，“轮到我了，让我给你们最后一吻……”

她说着，展开了纱巾，罩住两个孩子，仿佛她要用光明的力量最后一次将孩子们包裹住一般。然后，她给了每个孩子一个长长的、充满爱意的吻。泰泰尔和麦泰尔恳求地紧紧拉住她不放手。

“不要，不要，不要，光！”他们哭着说，“请留下来陪着我们！……爸爸不会介意的……我们会告诉妈妈你人多好……你一个人要去哪里呢？……”

“不会多远的，我的孩子，”光说，“就在万物的沉默国度之中。”

“不，不，”泰泰尔说，“我不让你走……”

但光用一个充满慈爱的手势让他们安静了下来，对他们说了一些他们永远都不会忘记的话。很久之后，当泰泰尔和麦泰尔都已经苍老，成了别人的爷爷奶奶，他们都还记得那些话，并经常对他们的孙子孙女重复。

光那些打动人心的话是这样说的：

“听着，泰泰尔，不要忘记，孩子，在这个世界上你能够看到的一切，既没有开始，也没有结束。如果你心中始终记住这一点，在成长中始终不忘，那么，无论在什么情况下，你都会知道该说什么，做什么，期待什么。”

这时，我们的两个小朋友抽泣起来，光又用充满爱意的声音补充道：

“别哭，我亲爱的孩子……我没有像水一样的声音，我只有我的明亮，人类却无法理解这明亮……但是我会一直照耀着人，直到他生命的终点……千万不要忘了，每一束漫洒的月光，每一点闪烁的星光，每一次晨光，每一盏灯火，都是我在对你诉说，你灵魂中每一个善良光明的念头，也都有我的存在。”

就在这个时候，小木屋中祖父留下来的钟敲了八下。光沉默了一会儿，然后用突然间变得隐约的声音低语道：

“再见！……再见！……时间到了！……再见！”

她的纱巾渐渐褪去，她的笑容变得苍白，她的眼睛闭上了，她的身影慢慢消失了，透过泪水，孩子们的眼睛再也看不到别的东西，唯有他们脚下一缕正慢慢消失的淡淡的光。然后，他们转头去看其他人……但那些物品和元素也已经消失了……

第十章　醒来


在樵夫泰尔家的木屋中，祖父留下来的钟已经敲了八下。两个孩子——泰泰尔和麦泰尔，依然还睡在他们的小床中。泰尔妈妈站在床边看着他们，她两手叉腰，围裙卷了起来，笑着数落他们。

“我可不能让他们一直睡到中午呀，”她说，“快点，起来，你们这些小懒骨头！”

但是，不管是摇晃他们、亲吻他们，还是把他们的被子掀了，都没有什么用，他们不断地躺回枕头上，鼻子朝着天花板，嘴巴张得大大的，眼睛紧紧闭着，脸颊泛着粉红色。

最后，在肋骨上挨了温柔的一击之后，泰泰尔睁开了一只眼睛，嘟嘟囔囔地说：

“怎么了？……光？……你在哪里？……不，不，别走……”

“光！”泰尔妈妈大笑着叫道，“是呀，当然，当然有光啦！……天亮了很久了！……你是怎么了？……你看起来像瞎了一样……”

“妈妈！……妈妈！……”泰泰尔揉着眼睛，“是你呀！”

“哎呀，当然是我啦！……你为什么这么瞪着我？……我的鼻孔朝上长了？”

这时候，泰泰尔已经完全清醒了，所以并没有回答这个问题。他此刻能感到的只有高兴！他已经好久好久没有见到妈妈了，想要一直亲吻她，怎么都不满足。

泰尔妈妈不安起来。这到底是怎么回事？她的儿子疯了吗？他怎么突然间说起了什么漫长的旅途，还有仙女、水、牛奶、糖、火、面包和光陪着！他还相信他已经离开家一年了！……

“但你根本没离开过这个房间！”泰尔妈妈叫道，现在她几乎吓坏了，“我昨晚上把你放在床上的，今天早晨你还在床上啊！今天是圣诞节，你没听到村子里的钟声吗？……”

“当然，今天是圣诞节，”泰泰尔固执地说，“我是在一年前离开的，就在圣诞前夜啊！……你们没有生我气吧？……你觉得很伤心吧？……还有爸爸怎么说的呀？……”

“好啦，你还没有睡醒呢！”泰尔妈妈以此自我安慰道，“你还在做梦呢！……快点起床，穿上你的短裤和小夹克……”

“呃，我穿着我的衬衫呢！”泰泰尔说。

他猛地起身，然后跪在床上，开始穿衣服，他的妈妈一直盯着他看，脸上挂着担忧的表情。

小男孩继续嘟囔说：

“你要是不相信我，就问问麦泰尔……哦，我们经历了那么多的冒险啊！……我们见到了爷爷和奶奶……是的，是在回忆之地……那是在我们冒险的路上。他们都死了，但是他们都很好，是不是，麦泰尔？”

此刻，麦泰尔也醒了过来，和哥哥一起描述他们去拜访祖父母的旅程，还有他们和小弟弟、小妹妹们相处时的乐趣。

泰尔妈妈真的受不了了。她跑到小屋的门口，用尽全力地叫她的丈夫。泰尔爸爸现在正在森林边上干活。

“噢，亲爱的，噢，亲爱的！”她大叫道，“我要失去他们了，就像失去其他孩子一样！……回来吧！……快回来呀……”

泰尔爸爸很快便回到了小屋，手里还拎着斧子。他听着妻子的哭诉，两个孩子则又开始讲述他们的冒险故事，还问他过去这一年他都做了什么。

“你看，你看啊！”泰尔妈妈已经哭了，“他们都神志不清了，他们肯定是生病了，去找医生来……”

不过，樵夫爸爸可不是大惊小怪的人，他吻了吻孩子们，镇定地点燃烟斗，说他们看起来都很好，没必要着急。

这个时候，传来了一阵敲门声，邻居走了进来。这个邻居是一个小个子的老太太，手里拄着一根拐杖，很像仙女贝丽露娜。孩子们一下子扑上去搂住她的脖子，围着她手舞足蹈，高兴地大叫：

“这是仙女贝丽露娜！”

这个邻居有些耳背，没有留意他们的叫声，只是对泰尔妈妈说：

“我来借点火，好去做我的圣诞炖菜……今天早上可真是冷死了……早安，孩子们……”

这个时候，泰泰尔思考了一下。无疑，再次见到老仙女，他感到非常开心，但是如果她得知他没有找到青鸟，会说什么呢？但他下决心像个男子汉一样，于是大胆地走向前说：

“仙女贝丽露娜，我没有找到青鸟……”

“他在说什么呢？”邻居太太被吓了一大跳。

泰尔妈妈又担心起来：“行了，泰泰尔，你不认得柏林格特太太了吗？”

“哎呀，认得，当然，”泰泰尔上下打量着邻居，“这是仙女贝丽露娜。”

“贝……什么？”邻居问。

“贝丽露娜。”泰泰尔平静地回答道。

“柏林格特，”邻居说，“你是说柏林格特。”

泰泰尔被她肯定的语气说得有点儿不确定，他答道：

“贝丽露娜也好，柏林格特也好，随你高兴吧，夫人，但是我知道我要说的……”

泰尔爸爸已经有些受够了。

“我们必须到此为止了，”他说，“我们给他们两巴掌吧。”

“不要，”邻居说，“这不值得。不过是梦的影响而已，他们肯定是睡觉时照到月光了(1)……我那病重的小女儿，就经常会这样……”

泰尔妈妈暂时放下了自己的担心，开始问候柏林格特家的小女儿。

“她就那样子啦，”邻居摇着头说，“她起不来床，医生说她的神经有问题……不过，我知道什么能够令她痊愈。就在今天早上，她还跟我要呢，想当作她的圣诞礼物……”

她有些犹豫，叹着气看着泰泰尔，用一种沮丧的口气接着说：

“我能做什么呢？那只是她一厢情愿罢了……”

其他人都沉默地看着彼此，他们都知道邻居的这些话是什么意思。那个小女孩一直都说如果泰泰尔能把自己的鸽子送给她，她就会好起来的，但是泰泰尔太喜欢那鸽子了，不愿意和鸽子分开……

“呃，”泰尔妈妈对儿子说，“把你的鸟儿送给那个可怜的小东西不行吗？她盼望得到那只小鸽子都盼了那么久了！……”

“我的鸟儿！”泰泰尔拍了拍自己的额头，仿佛他们在说的是非常奇怪的事情，“我的鸟儿，”他重复说，“真是的，我都把它忘了！……还有鸟笼！……麦泰尔，你看到鸟笼了吗？……就是面包拎着的那一个……是啊，是啊，就是同一个鸟笼，在这里，在这里！”

泰泰尔简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。他拉过一把椅子，放在鸟笼下面，开心地爬上椅子，一边说：

“当然啦，我愿意送给她，我愿意！……”

然后，他惊讶地呆住了。

“天哪，它是青色的！”他说，“是我的鸽子，一模一样的，不过我不在的这段时间它变成青色的了！”

我们的主人公从椅子上跳下来，欢快地跳跃着说：

“它就是我们在寻找的青鸟！我们走了那么远，那么远，而它却一直都在这里！……它竟然在家里！……啊，多神奇啊！……麦泰尔，你看到那只鸟了吗？光会说什么呢？……给你，柏林格特太太，快点带去给你的小女儿吧……”

他这么说着时，泰尔妈妈扑到了丈夫的怀中，哭诉道：

“你看到了吗？……你看到了吗？……他又犯病了……他精神错乱了……”

这个时候，柏林格特太太的脸明媚起来，她将两只手握在一起，说着感谢的话。泰泰尔把鸟送给她的时候，她简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。她将小男孩抱在怀中，因喜悦和感激而泪水涟涟。

“你把它送给我了？”她不断问着，“你就这样给我了，不求回报？……天啊，她该有多高兴啊！……我得快点儿回去……我会回来告诉你她说了什么的……”

“是啊，是啊，快点儿回去吧，”泰泰尔说，“有些鸟儿会变色的！”

柏林格特太太跑出门去，泰泰尔跟在她后面将门关好。然后他站在门口，转身看着小屋的墙壁，看着周围的一切，似乎大吃一惊。

“爸爸，妈妈，你们对这房子做了什么呀？”他问，“虽然还是原来的样子，但是看起来漂亮多了。”

他的父母十分不解，面面相觑，小男孩继续说：

“啊，是啊，全都重新粉刷过了，看起来特别新。所有东西都干干净净的，亮闪闪的……看看窗外的森林！……多大、多美啊！……人们会觉得它好新啊！……在这里，我感到真是高兴啊，噢，我真是高兴啊！”

可敬的樵夫和他的妻子不明白他们的儿子到底是怎么了。但我亲爱的小读者们，你们跟随着泰泰尔和麦泰尔经历了美丽的梦境，能够猜出来到底是什么改变了我们年轻的小主人公眼中的一切。

在他的梦里，仙女给他的法宝帮助他睁开眼睛，那一切并非没有半点意义。他已经学会了去发现周围事物的美丽。他经历了考验，勇气得到了增长。在追寻青鸟——那只能给仙女贝丽露娜的小女儿带来幸福的青鸟——的过程中，他已经变得非常慷慨，非常善良，仅仅是将快乐带给其他人的念头，就能令他满心喜悦。而且经过那些无尽的、神奇的奇幻国度，他面对生活时的想法已经变得非常开放。

男孩认为一切都变得漂亮了，这是对的，因为随着他的理解力更加丰富，更加纯粹，周围的一切也必然会变得比过去更加美丽。

泰泰尔继续开心地巡视着小屋。他凑到面包烤盘那里，对面包友善地说话。他跑到睡在篮子中的泰罗身边，称赞他在森林之战中的出色表现。

麦泰尔弯腰爱抚在炉子边打盹的泰莱特，说：

“哎呀，泰莱特？……你认识我的，我看得出来，不过你再也不能说话了。”

泰泰尔把手放在前额。

“啊！”他叫道，“钻石不见了！……谁拿走了我绿色的小帽子？……没关系，我也不需要了！……啊，这是火！早上好，先生！他一直噼啪作响，惹水生气呢！”他跑到水龙头边，拧开水龙头，弯下腰靠近水，“早上好，水，早上好！……她在说什么？……她还在说话呢，不过我没有办法像原来那样听懂了……啊，我真高兴啊，我真的很高兴啊！”

“我也是啊，我也很高兴！”麦泰尔说。

我们的两个小朋友手拉着手，在厨房里面蹦蹦跳跳。

泰尔妈妈看到他们充满活力的样子，心稍微放宽了一些。泰尔爸爸非常平静镇定。他坐在桌边，吃他的粥，笑着说：

“你看，他们在玩开心生活的游戏呢！”

当然，这个可怜又可敬的人并不知道，那场神奇的梦并没有教会他的孩子们玩开心生活的游戏，而是教会了他们开心生活，这是最了不起而又最难的一课。

“所有人当中，我最喜欢光了，”泰泰尔踮着脚尖，站在窗边，对麦泰尔说，“你看她就在那边，穿过森林中的树木。今天晚上，她会在灯里。天哪，噢，天哪，这一切都多美好啊，我感到真高兴啊，我真高兴啊……”

他停下来，倾听着。所有人都在倾听着。他们听到了笑声，听到了欢乐的声音，那声音越来越近。

“那是光的声音！”泰泰尔叫道，“我去开门！”

实际上，站在门口的是一个小女孩，就是柏林格特家的小女儿，还有她的母亲柏林格特太太。

“看看她，”柏林格特太太简直喜不自胜，“她能跑、能跳，她简直要飞起来了！这真是个奇迹！她一看那只鸟儿，就跳起来了，就像这样……”

柏林格特太太单腿轮换着跳来跳去，不管是不是会跌倒，摔伤她长长的鹰钩鼻。

孩子们拍着手，每个人都在笑着。

小女孩穿着白色的长睡衣，站在厨房中间。在病了好几个月之后，现在能自己站起来，真的有点儿惊讶。她脸上带着微笑，将泰泰尔的鸽子抱在胸前。

泰泰尔先看了看那个孩子，然后又看向麦泰尔。

“你不觉得她很像是光吗？”他问。

“她小多了。”麦泰尔说。

“是啊，确实是！”泰泰尔说，“但她会长大的……”

三个孩子试着给小鸟喂了一些食物，他们的父母看着他们，感觉放松了很多，都露出了笑容。

泰泰尔容光焕发。我亲爱的小读者们，我不想瞒你们，鸽子是根本不会改变颜色的，是泰泰尔心中的喜悦和幸福，在他的眼睛里给那只鸟儿蒙上了一层瑰丽而明亮的青色。不过这有什么关系！泰泰尔并不知道这些，但他发现了光的伟大秘密，那就是：当我们想要与人分享幸福的时候，我们就离幸福近了一步。

而现在，不幸发生了。所有人都变得异常激动，孩子们尖叫起来，父母们举着胳膊，冲向开着的门那儿。因为鸟儿突然飞走了！很快就飞走了！

“我的鸟儿啊，我的鸟儿啊！”小女孩抽泣着说。

泰泰尔是第一个跑到台阶边的，但又兴致高昂地回来了。

“没关系的，”他说，“不要哭，它还在这屋子里面，我们会再次找到它的。”

他吻了小女孩一下。小女孩破涕为笑。

“你肯定能再抓到它，是不是？”她问。

“相信我，”我们的朋友自信地回答，“我知道它在哪里。”

而你们，我亲爱的小读者们，现在也知道了青鸟在哪里。亲爱的光什么都没有告诉樵夫的孩子们，但是她教会他们成为善良、和气、慷慨的人，向他们指明了通向幸福的路。

假如，在这个故事的一开始，她就对他们说：

“你们直接回家去吧，青鸟就在那里，在那简陋的小屋里，在一个柳条笼子里，和爱你们的父亲母亲在一起。”

孩子们是绝对不会相信的。

“什么？”泰泰尔会回答，“青鸟就是我的鸽子？别胡说了，我的鸽子是灰色的！……幸福，在小屋里面？和爸爸妈妈在一起？唉，哎呀！我家里可没有玩具，无聊得要命，我们想要去远方，面对无尽的冒险，享受各种乐趣……”

他肯定会这么说的，他和麦泰尔不会听光的建议，而是不顾一切出发去寻找，因为如果我们不亲身去经历，去体验，最确定的真理也一无是处。要将这个世界上所有的智慧都告诉给一个孩子，只需要很短的时间，但是要去理解那些智慧，整个生命都是不够的，因为我们自身的经验是我们唯一的光。

我们每个人都在寻找着自己的幸福，必须去经历无尽的痛苦，承受诸多残酷的失望，才能够明白：思想和心灵所能体会到的简单而纯粹的快乐，才会让人变得幸福。

Chapter 1　THE WOODCUTTER’S COTTAGE


ONCE upon a time, a woodcutter and his wife lived in their cottage on the edge of a large and ancient forest. They had two dear little children who met with a most wonderful adventure.

But, before telling you all about it, I must describe the children to you and let you know something of their character; for, if they had not been so sweet and brave and plucky, the curious story which you are about to hear would never have happened at all.

Tyltyl—that was our hero’s name—was ten years old; and Mytyl, his little sister, was only six.

Tyltyl was a fine, tall little fellow, stout and well-set-up, with curly black hair which was often in a tangle, for he was fond of a romp. He was a great favorite because of his smiling and good-tempered face and the bright look in his eyes; but, best of all, he had the ways of a bold and fearless little man, which showed the noble qualities of his heart. When, early in the morning, he trotted along the forest-road by the side of his daddy, Tyl the woodcutter, for all his shabby clothes he looked so proud and gallant that every beautiful thing on the earth and in the sky seemed to lie in wait for him to smile upon him as he passed.

His little sister was very different, but looked ever so sweet and pretty in her long frock, which Mummy Tyl kept neatly patched for her. She was as fair as her brother was dark; and her large timid eyes were blue as the forget-me-nots in the fields. Anything was enough to frighten her and she would cry at the least thing; but her little child’s soul already held the highest womanly qualities: she was loving and gentle and so fondly devoted to her brother that, rather than abandon him, she did not hesitate to undertake a long and dangerous journey in his company.

What happened and how our little hero and heroine went off into the world one night in search of happiness: that is the subject of my story.

Daddy Tyl’s cottage was the poorest of the countryside; and it seemed even more wretched because it stood opposite a splendid hall in which rich children lived. From the windows of the cottage you could see what went on inside the Hall when the dining-room and drawing-rooms were lit up in the evening. And, in the daytime, you saw the little children playing on the terraces, in the gardens and in the hot-houses which people came all the way from town to visit because they were always filled with the rarest flowers.

Now, one evening which was not like other evenings, for it was Christmas Eve, Mummy Tyl put her little ones to bed and kissed them even more lovingly than usual. She felt a little sad because, owing to the stormy weather, Daddy Tyl was not able to go to work in the forest; and so she had no money to buy presents with which to fill Tyltyl and Mytyl’s stockings. The Children soon fell asleep, everything was still and silent and not a sound was heard but the purring of the cat, the snoring of the dog and the ticking of the great grandfather’s clock. But suddenly a light as bright as day crept through the shutters, the lamp upon the table lit again of itself and the two Children awoke, yawned, rubbed their eyes, stretched out their arms in bed and Tyltyl, in a cautious voice called:

“Mytyl?”

“Yes, Tyltyl?” was the answer.

“Are you asleep?”

“Are you?”

“No,” said Tyltyl. “How can I be asleep, when I’m talking to you?”

“I say, is this Christmas Day?” asked his sister.

“Not yet; not till to-morrow. But Father Christmas won’t bring us anything this year.”

“Why not?”

“I heard Mummy say that she couldn’t go to town to tell him. But he will come next year.”

“Is next year far off?”

“A good long while,” said the boy. “But he will come to the rich children to-night.”

“Really?”

“Hullo!” cried Tyltyl of a sudden. “Mummy’s forgotten to put out the lamp!... I’ve an idea!”

“What?”

“Let’s get up.”

“But we mustn’t,” said Mytyl, who always remembered.

“Why, there’s no one about!... Do you see the shutters?”

“Oh, how bright they are!...”

“It’s the lights of the party,” said Tyltyl.

“What party?”

“The rich children opposite. It’s the Christmas-tree. Let’s open the shutters....”

“Can we?” asked Mytyl, timidly.

“Of course we can; there’s no one to stop us.... Do you hear the music?... Let us get up.”

The two Children jumped out of bed, ran to the window, climbed on the stool in front of it and threw back the shutters. A bright light filled the room; and the Children looked out eagerly:

“We can see everything!” said Tyltyl.

“I can’t,” said poor little Mytyl, who could hardly find room on the stool.

“It’s snowing!” said Tyltyl. “There are two carriages, with six horses each!”

“There are twelve little boys getting out!” said Mytyl, who was doing her best to peep out of the window.

“Don’t be silly!... They’re little girls....”

“They’ve got knickerbockers on....”

“Do be quiet!... And look!...”

“What are those gold things there, hanging from the branches?”

“Why, toys, to be sure!” said Tyltyl. “Swords, guns, soldiers, cannons....”

“And what’s that, all round the table?”

“Cakes and fruit and cream-tarts.”

“Oh, how pretty the children are!” cried Mytyl, clapping her hands.

“And how they’re laughing and laughing!” answered Tyltyl.

“And the little ones dancing!...”

“Yes, yes; let’s dance too!” shouted Tyltyl.

And the two Children began to stamp their feet for joy on the stool:

“Oh, what fun!” said Mytyl.

“They’re getting the cakes!” cried Tyltyl. “They can touch them!... They’re eating, they’re eating, they’re eating!... Oh, how lovely, how lovely!...”

Mytyl began to count imaginary cakes:

“I have twelve!...”

“And I four times twelve!” said Tyltyl. “But I’ll give you some....”

And our little friends, dancing, laughing and shrieking with delight, rejoiced so prettily in the other children’s happiness that they forgot their own poverty and want. They were soon to have their reward. Suddenly, there came a loud knocking at the door. The startled Children ceased their romp and dared not move a limb. Then the big wooden latch lifted of itself, with a loud creak; the door opened slowly; and in crept a little old woman, dressed all in green, with a red hood over her head. She was hump-backed and lame and had only one eye; her nose and chin almost touched; and she walked leaning on a stick. She was surely a fairy.

She hobbled up to the Children and asked, in a snuffling voice:

“Have you the grass here that sings or the bird that is blue?”

“We have some grass,” replied Tyltyl, trembling all over his body, “but it can’t sing....”

“Tyltyl has a bird,” said Mytyl.

“But I can’t give it away, because it’s mine,” the little fellow added, quickly.

Now wasn’t that a capital reason?

The Fairy put on her big, round glasses and looked at the bird:

“He’s not blue enough,” she exclaimed. “I must absolutely have the Blue Bird. It’s for my little girl, who is very ill.... Do you know what the Blue Bird stands for? No? I thought you didn’t; and, as you are good children, I will tell you.”

The Fairy raised her crooked finger to her long, pointed nose, and whispered, in a mysterious tone:

“The Blue Bird stands for happiness; and I want you to understand that my little girl must be happy in order to get well. That is why I now command you to go out into the world and find the Blue Bird for her. You will have to start at once.... Do you know who I am?”

The Children exchanged puzzled glances. The fact was that they had never seen a fairy before; and they felt a little scared in her presence. However, Tyltyl soon said politely:

“You are rather like our neighbor, Madame Berlingot....”

Tyltyl thought that, in saying this, he was paying the Fairy a compliment; for Madame Berlingot’s shop, which was next door to their cottage, was a very pleasant place. It was stocked with sweets, marbles, chocolate cigars and sugar dolls and hens; and, at fair-time, there were big gingerbread dolls covered all over with gilt paper. Goody Berlingot had a nose that was quite as ugly as the Fairy’s; she was old also; and, like the Fairy, she walked doubled up in two; but she was very kind and she had a dear little girl who used to play on Sundays with the woodcutter’s Children. Unfortunately, the poor little pretty, fair-haired thing was always suffering from some unknown complaint, which often kept her in bed. When this happened, she used to beg and pray for Tyltyl’s dove to play with; but Tyltyl was so fond of the bird that he would not give it to her. All this, thought the little boy, was very like that which the Fairy told him; and that was why he called her Berlingot.

Much to his surprise, the Fairy turned crimson with rage. It was a hobby of hers to be like nobody, because she was a fairy and able to change her appearance, from one moment to the next, as she pleased. That evening, she happened to be ugly and old and hump-backed; she had lost one of her eyes; and two lean wisps of grey hair hung over her shoulders.

“What do I look like?” she asked Tyltyl. “Am I pretty or ugly? Old or young?”

Her reason for asking these questions was to try the kindness of the little boy. He turned away his head and dared not say what he thought of her looks. Then she cried:

“I am the Fairy Berylune!”

“Oh, that’s all right!” answered Tyltyl, who, by this time, was shaking in every limb.

This satisfied the Fairy; and, as the Children were still in their night-shirts, she told them to get dressed. She herself helped Mytyl and, while she did so, asked:

“Where are your Father and Mother?”

“In there,” said Tyltyl, pointing to the door on the right. “They’re asleep.”

“And your Grandad and Granny?”

“They’re dead....”

“And your little brothers and sisters.... Have you any?...”

“Oh, yes, three little brothers!” said Tyltyl.

“And four little sisters,” added Mytyl.

“Where are they?” asked the Fairy.

“They are dead, too,” answered Tyltyl.

“Would you like to see them again?”

“Oh, yes!... At once!... Show them to us!...”

“I haven’t got them in my pocket,” said the Fairy. “But this is very lucky; you will see them when you go through the Land of Memory. It’s on the way to the Blue Bird, just on the left, past the third turning.... What were you doing when I knocked?”

“We were playing at eating cakes,” said Tyltyl.

“Have you any cakes?... Where are they?...”

“In the house of the rich children.... Come and look, it’s so lovely!”

And Tyltyl dragged the Fairy to the window.

“But it’s the others who are eating them!” said she.

“Yes, but we can see them eat,” said Tyltyl.

“Aren’t you cross with them?”

“What for?”

“For eating all the cakes. I think it’s very wrong of them not to give you any.”

“Not at all; they’re rich!... I say, isn’t it beautiful over there?”

“It’s just the same here, only you can’t see....”

“Yes, I can,” said Tyltyl. “I have very good eyes. I can see the time on the church clock; and Daddy can’t!”

The Fairy suddenly grew angry:

“I tell you that you can’t see!” she said.

And she grew angrier and angrier. As though it mattered about seeing the time on the church clock!

Of course, the little boy was not blind; but, as he was kind-hearted and deserved to be happy, she wanted to teach him to see what is good and beautiful in all things. It was not an easy task, for she well knew that most people live and die without enjoying the happiness that lies all around them. Still, as she was a fairy, she was all-powerful; and so she decided to give him a little hat adorned with a magic diamond that would possess the extraordinary property of always showing him the truth, which would help him to see the inside of Things and thus teach him that each of them has a life and an existence of its own, created to match and gladden ours.

The Fairy took the little hat from a great bag hanging by her side. It was green and had a white cockade, with the big diamond shining in the middle of it. Tyltyl was beside himself with delight. The Fairy explained to him how the diamond worked. By pressing the top, you saw the soul of Things; if you gave it a little turn to the right, you discovered the Past; and, when you turned it to the left, you beheld the Future.

Tyltyl beamed all over his face and danced for joy; and then he at once became afraid of losing the little hat:

“Daddy will take it from me!” he cried.

“No,” said the Fairy, “for no one can see it as long as it’s on your head.... Will you try it?”

“Yes, yes!” cried the Children, clapping their hands.

The hat was no sooner on the little boy’s head than a magic change came over everything. The old Fairy turned into a young and beautiful princess, dressed all in silk and covered with sparkling jewels; the walls of the cottage became transparent and gleamed like precious stones; the humble deal furniture shone like marble. The two children ran from right to left clapping their hands and shouting with delight.

“Oh, how lovely, how lovely!” exclaimed Tyltyl.

And Mytyl, like the vain little thing she was, stood spellbound before the beauty of the fair princess’ dress.

But further and much greater surprises were in store for them. Had not the Fairy said that the Things and the Animals would come to life, talk and behave like everybody else? Lo and behold, suddenly the door of the grandfather’s clock opened, the silence was filled with the sweetest music and twelve little daintily-dressed and laughing dancers began to skip and spin all around the Children.

“They are the Hours of your life,” said the Fairy.

“May I dance with them?” asked Tyltyl, gazing with admiration at those pretty creatures, who seemed to skim over the floor like birds.

But just then he burst into a wild fit of laughter! Who was that funny fat fellow, all out of breath and covered with flour, who came struggling out of the bread-pan and bowing to the children? It was Bread! Bread himself, taking advantage of the reign of liberty to go for a little walk on earth! He looked like a stout, comical old gentleman; his face was puffed out with dough; and his large hands, at the end of his thick arms, were not able to meet, when he laid them on his great, round stomach. He was dressed in a tight-fitting crust-coloured suit, with stripes across the chest like those on the nice buttered rolls which we have for breakfast in the morning. On his head—just think of it!—he wore an enormous bun, which made a funny sort of turban.

He had hardly tumbled out of his pan, when other loaves just like him, but smaller, followed after and began to frisk about with the Hours, without giving a thought to the flour which they scattered over those pretty ladies and which wrapped them in great white clouds.

It was a queer and charming dance; and the Children were delighted. The Hours waltzed with the loaves; the plates, joining in the fun, hopped up and down on the dresser, at the risk of falling off and smashing to pieces; the glasses in the cupboard clinked together, to drink the health of one and all. As to the forks, they chattered so loudly with the knives that you could not hear yourself speak for the noise....

There is no knowing what would have happened if the din had lasted much longer. Daddy and Mummy Tyl would certainly have waked up. Fortunately, when the romp was at its height, an enormous flame darted out of the chimney and filled the room with a great red glow, as though the house were on fire. Everybody bolted into the corners in dismay, while Tyltyl and Mytyl, sobbing with fright, hid their heads under the good Fairy’s cloak.

“Don’t be afraid,” she said. “It’s only Fire, who has come to join in your fun. He is a good sort, but you had better not touch him, for he has a hot temper.”

Peeping anxiously through the beautiful gold lace that edged the Fairy’s cloak, the Children saw a tall, red fellow looking at them and laughing at their fears. He was dressed in scarlet tights and spangles; from his shoulders hung silk scarves that were just like flames when he waved them with his long arms; and his hair stood up on his head in straight, flaring locks. He started flinging out his arms and legs and jumping round the room like a madman.

Tyltyl, though feeling a little easier, dared not yet leave his refuge. Then the Fairy Berylune had a capital idea: she pointed her wand at the tap; and at once there appeared a young girl who wept like a regular fountain. It was Water. She was very pretty, but she looked extremely sad; and she sang so sweetly that it was like the rippling of a spring. Her long hair, which fell to her feet, might have been made of sea-weed. She had nothing on but her bed-gown; but the water that streamed over her clothed her in shimmering colours. She hesitated at first and gave a glance around her; then, catching sight of Fire still whirling about like a great madcap, she made an angry and indignant rush at him, spraying his face, splashing and wetting him with all her might. Fire flew into a rage and began to smoke. Nevertheless, as he found himself suddenly thwarted by his old enemy, he thought it wiser to retire to a corner. Water also beat a retreat; and it seemed as though peace would be restored once more.

The two Children, at last recovering from their alarm, were asking the Fairy what was going to happen next, when a startling noise of breaking crockery made them look round towards the table. What a surprise! The milk-jug lay on the floor, smashed into a thousand fragments, and from the pieces rose a charming lady, who gave little screams of terror and clasped her hands and turned up her eyes with a beseeching glance.

Tyltyl hastened to console her, for he at once knew that she was Milk; and, as he was very fond of her, he gave her a good kiss. She was as fresh and pretty as a little dairy-maid; and a delicious scent of hay came from her white frock all covered with cream.

Meanwhile, Mytyl was watching the sugar-loaf, which also seemed to be coming to life. Packed in its blue paper wrapper, on a shelf near the door, it was swaying from left to right and from right to left without any result. But at last a long thin arm was seen to come out, followed by a peaked head, which split the paper, and by another arm and two long legs that seemed never to end!... Oh, you should have seen how funny Sugar looked: so funny, indeed, that the Children could not help laughing in his face! And yet they would have liked to be civil to him, for they heard the Fairy introducing him in these words:

“This, Tyltyl, is the soul of Sugar. His pockets are crammed with sugar and each of his fingers is a sugar-stick.”

How wonderful to have a friend all made of sugar, off whom you can bite a piece whenever you feel inclined!

“Bow, wow, wow!... Good-morning! Good-morning, my little god!... At last, at last we can talk!... Bark and wag my tail as I might, you never understood!... I love you! I love you!”

Who can this extraordinary person be, who jostles everybody and fills the house with his noisy gaiety? We know him at once. It is Tyllo, the good Dog who tries his hardest to understand mankind, the good-natured Animal who goes with the Children to the forest, the faithful guardian who protects the door, the staunch friend who is ever true and ever loyal! Here he comes walking on his hind-paws, as on a pair of legs too short for him, and beating the air with the two others, making gestures like a clumsy little man. He has not changed: he still has his smooth, mustard-coloured coat and his jolly bull-dog head, with the black muzzle, but he is much bigger and then he talks! He talks as fast as he can, as though he wanted in one moment to avenge his whole race, which has been doomed to silence for centuries. He talks of everything, now that he is at last able to explain himself; and it is a pretty sight to see him kissing his little master and mistress and calling them “his little gods!” He sits up, he jumps about the room, knocking against the furniture, upsetting Mytyl with his big soft paws, lolling his tongue, wagging his tail and puffing and panting as though he were out hunting. We at once see his simple, generous nature. Persuaded of his own importance, he fancies that he alone is indispensable in the new world of Things.

After making all the fuss he wanted of the Children, he started going the round of the company, distributing the attentions which he thought that none could do without. His joy, now set free, found vent without restraint; and, because he was the most loving of creatures, he would also have been the happiest, if, in becoming human, he had not, unfortunately, retained his little doggy failings. He was jealous! He was terribly jealous; and his heart felt a pang when he saw Tylette, the Cat, coming to life in her turn and being petted and kissed by the Children, just as he had been! Oh, how he hated the Cat! To bear the sight of her beside him, to see her always sharing in the affection of the family: that was the great sacrifice which fate demanded of him. He accepted it, however, without a word, because it pleased his little gods; and he went so far as to leave her alone. But he had had many a crime on his conscience because of her! Had he not, one evening, crept stealthily into Goody Berlingot’s kitchen in order to throttle her old tom-cat, who had never done him any harm? Had he not broken the back of the Persian cat at the Hall opposite? Did he not sometimes go to town on purpose to hunt cats and put an end to them, all to wreak his spite? And now Tylette was going to talk, just like himself! Tylette would be his equal in the new world that was opening before him!

“Oh, there is no justice left on earth!” was his bitter thought. “There is no justice left!”

In the meantime, the Cat, who had begun by washing herself and polishing her claws, calmly put out her paw to the little girl.

She really was a very pretty cat; and, if our friend Tyllo’s jealousy had not been such an ugly feeling, we might almost have overlooked it for once! How could you fail to be attracted by Tylette’s eyes, which were like topaz set in emeralds? How could you resist the pleasure of stroking the wonderful black velvet back? How could you not love her grace, her gentleness and the dignity of her poses?

Smiling gently and speaking in well-chosen language, she said to Mytyl:

“Good-morning, miss!... How well you look this morning!...”

And the Children patted her like anything.

Tyllo kept watching the Cat from the other end of the room:

“Now that she’s standing on her hind-legs like a man,” he muttered, “she looks just like the Devil, with her pointed ears, her long tail and her dress as black as ink!” And he could not help growling between his teeth. “She’s also like the village chimney-sweep,” he went on, “whom I loathe and detest and whom I shall never take for a real man, whatever my little gods may say.... It’s lucky,” he added, with a sigh, “that I know more about a good many things than they do!”

But suddenly, no longer able to master himself, he flew at the Cat and shouted, with a loud laugh that was more like a roar:

“I’m going to frighten Tylette! Bow, wow, wow!”

But the Cat, who was dignified even when still an animal, now thought herself called to the loftiest destinies. She considered that the time had come to raise a tall barrier between herself and the Dog, who had never been more than an ill-bred person in her eyes; and, stepping back in disdain, she just said:

“Sir, I don’t know you.”

Tyllo gave a bound under the insult, whereupon the Cat bristled up, twisting her whiskers under her little pink nose (for she was very proud of those two pale blotches which gave a special touch to her dark beauty); and then, arching her back and sticking up her tail, she hissed out, “Fft! Fft!” and stood stock-still on the chest of drawers, like a dragon on the lid of a Chinese vase.

Tyltyl and Mytyl screamed with laughter; but the quarrel would certainly have had a bad ending if, at that moment, a great thing had not happened. At eleven o’clock in the evening, in the middle of that winter’s night, a great light, the light of the noon-day sun, glowing and dazzling, burst into the cottage.

“Hullo, there’s daylight!” said the little boy, who no longer knew what to make of things. “What will Daddy say?”

But, before the Fairy had time to set him right, Tyltyl understood; and, full of wonderment, he knelt before the latest vision that bewitched his eyes.

At the window, in the center of a great halo of sunshine, there rose slowly, like a tall golden sheaf, a maiden of surpassing loveliness! Gleaming veils covered her figure without hiding its beauty; her bare arms, stretched in the attitude of giving, seemed transparent; and her great clear eyes wrapped all upon whom they fell in a fond embrace.

“It’s the Queen!” said Tyltyl.

“It’s a Fairy Princess!” cried Mytyl, kneeling beside her brother.

“No, my Children,” said the Fairy. “It is Light!”

Smiling, Light stepped towards the two little ones. She, the Light of Heaven, the strength and beauty of the Earth, was proud of the humble mission entrusted to her; she, never before held captive, living in space and bestowing her bounty upon all alike, consented to be confined, for a brief spell, within a human shape, so as to lead the Children out into the world and teach them to know that other Light, the Light of the Mind, which we never see, but which helps us to see all things that are.

“It is Light!” exclaimed the Things and the Animals; and, as they all loved her, they began to dance around her with cries of pleasure.

Tyltyl and Mytyl capered with joy. Never had they pictured so amusing and so pretty a party; and they shouted louder than all the rest.

Then what was bound to happen came. Suddenly, three knocks were heard against the wall, loud enough to throw the house down! It was Daddy Tyl, who had been waked up by the din and who was now threatening to come and put a stop to it.

“Turn the diamond!” cried the Fairy to Tyltyl.

Our hero hastened to obey, but he had not the knack of it yet; besides, his hand shook at the thought that his father was coming. In fact, he was so awkward that he nearly broke the works.

“Not so quick, not so quick!” said the Fairy. “Oh dear, you’ve turned it too briskly: they will not have time to resume their places and we shall have a lot of bother!”

There was a general stampede. The walls of the cottage lost their splendour. All ran hither and thither, to return to their proper shape: Fire could not find his chimney; Water ran about looking for her tap; Sugar stood moaning in front of his torn wrapper; and Bread, the biggest of the loaves, was unable to squeeze into his pan, in which the other loaves had jumped higgledy-piggledy, taking up all the room. As for the Dog, he had grown too large for the hole in his kennel; and the Cat also could not get into her basket. The Hours alone, who were accustomed always to run faster than Man wished, had slipped back into the clock without delay.

Light stood motionless and unruffled, vainly setting an example of calmness to the others, who were all weeping and wailing around the Fairy:

“What is going to happen?” they asked. “Is there any danger?”

“Well,” said the Fairy, “I am bound to tell you the truth: all those who accompany the two Children will die at the end of the journey.”

They began to cry like anything, all except the Dog, who was delighted at remaining human as long as possible and who had already taken his stand next to Light, so as to be sure of going in front of his little master and mistress.

At that moment, there came a knocking even more dreadful than before.

“There’s Daddy again!” said Tyltyl. “He’s getting up, this time; I can hear him walking....”

“You see,” said the Fairy, “you have no choice now; it is too late; you must all start with us.... But you, Fire, don’t come near anybody; you, Dog, don’t tease the Cat; you, Water, try not to run all over the place; and you, Sugar, stop crying, unless you want to melt. Bread shall carry the cage in which to put the Blue Bird; and you shall all come to my house, where I will dress the Animals and the Things properly.... Let us go out this way!”

As she spoke, she pointed her wand at the window, which lengthened magically downwards, like a door. They all went out on tip-toe, after which the window resumed its usual shape. And so it came about that, on Christmas Night, in the clear light of the moon, while the bells rang out lustily, proclaiming the birth of Jesus, Tyltyl and Mytyl went in search of the Blue Bird that was to bring them happiness.





Chapter 2　AT THE FAIRY’S


THE Fairy Berylune’s Palace stood at the top of a very high mountain, on the way to the moon. It was so near that, on summer nights, when the sky was clear, you could plainly see the moon’s mountains and valleys, lakes and seas from the terrace of the palace. Here the Fairy studied the stars and read their secrets, for it was long since the Earth had had anything to teach her.

“This old planet no longer interests me!” she used to say to her friends, the giants of the mountain. “The men upon it still live with their eyes shut! Poor things, I pity them! I go down among them now and then, but it is out of charity, to try and save the little children from the fatal misfortune that awaits them in the darkness.”

This explains why she had come and knocked at the door of Daddy Tyl’s cottage on Christmas Eve.

And now to return to our travellers. They had hardly reached the high-road, when the Fairy remembered that they could not walk like that through the village, which was still lit up because of the feast. But her store of knowledge was so great that all her wishes were fulfilled at once. She pressed lightly on Tyltyl’s head and willed that they should all be carried by magic to her palace. Then and there, a cloud of fireflies surrounded our companions and wafted them gently towards the sky. They were at the Fairy’s palace before they had recovered from their surprise.

“Follow me,” she said and led them through chambers and passages all in gold and silver.

They stopped in a large room surrounded with mirrors on every side and containing an enormous wardrobe with light creeping through its chinks. The Fairy Berylune took a diamond key from her pocket and opened the wardrobe. One cry of amazement burst from every throat. Precious stuffs were seen piled one on the top of the other: mantles covered with gems, dresses of every sort and every country, pearl coronets, emerald necklaces, ruby bracelets.... Never had the Children beheld such riches! As for the Things, their state was rather one of utter bewilderment; and this was only natural, when you think that they were seeing the world for the first time and that it showed itself to them in such a queer way.

The Fairy helped them make their choice. Fire, Sugar and the Cat displayed a certain decision of taste. Fire, who only cared for red, at once chose a splendid bright red dress, with gold spangles. He put nothing on his head, for his head was always very hot. Sugar could not stand anything except white and pale blue: bright colours jarred on his sweet nature. The long blue and white dress which he selected and the pointed hat, like a candle extinguisher, which he wore on his head made him look perfectly ridiculous; but he was too silly to notice it and kept spinning before the glass like a top and admiring himself in blissful ignorance.

The Cat, who was always a lady and who was used to her dusky garments, reflected that black always looks well, in any circumstance, particularly now, when they were travelling without luggage. She therefore put on a suit of black tights, with jet embroidery, hung a long velvet cloak from her shoulders and perched a large cavalier hat, with a long feather, on her neat little head. She next asked for a pair of soft kid boots, in memory of Puss-in-Boots, her distinguished ancestor, and put a pair of gloves on her fore-paws, to protect them from the dust of the roads.

Thus attired, she took a satisfied glance at the mirror. Then, a little nervously, with an anxious eye and a quivering pink nose, she hastily invited Sugar and Fire to take the air with her. So they all three walked out, while the others went on dressing. Let us follow them for a moment, for we have already grown to like our brave little Tyltyl and we shall want to hear anything that is likely to help or delay his undertaking.

After passing through several splendid galleries, hung like balconies in the sky, our three cronies stopped in the hall; and the Cat at once addressed the meeting in a hushed voice:

“I have brought you here,” she said, “in order to discuss the position in which we are placed. Let us make the most of our last moment of liberty....”

But she was interrupted by a furious uproar:

“Bow, wow, wow!”

“There now!” cried the Cat. “There’s that idiot of a Dog! He has scented us out! We can’t get a minute’s peace. Let us hide behind the balustrade. He had better not hear what I have to say to you.”

“It’s too late,” said Sugar, who was standing by the door.

And, sure enough, Tyllo was coming up, jumping, barking, panting and delighted.

The Cat, when she saw him, turned away in disgust:

“He has put on the livery of one of the footmen of Cinderella’s coach.... It is just the thing for him: he has the soul of a flunkey!”

She ended these words with a “Fft! Fft!” and, stroking her whiskers, took up her stand, with a defiant air, between Sugar and Fire. The good Dog did not see her little game. He was wholly wrapped up in the pleasure of being gorgeously arrayed; and he danced round and round. It was really funny to see his velvet coat whirling like a merry-go-round, with the skirts opening every now and then and showing his little stumpy tail, which was all the more expressive as it had to express itself very briefly. For I need hardly tell you that Tyllo, like every well-bred bull-dog, had had his tail and his ears cropped as a puppy.

Poor fellow, he had long envied the tails of his brother dogs, which allowed them to use a much larger and more varied vocabulary. But physical deficiencies and the hardships of fortune strengthen our innermost qualities. Tyllo’s soul, having no outward means of expressing itself, had only gained through silence; and his look, which was always filled with love, had become very eloquent.

Today his big dark eyes glistened with delight; he had suddenly changed into a man! He was all over magnificent clothes; and he was about to perform a grand errand across the world in company with the gods!

“There!” he said. “There! Aren’t we fine!... Just look at this lace and embroidery!... It’s real gold and no mistake!”

He did not see that the others were laughing at him, for, to tell the truth, he did look very comical; but, like all simple creatures, he had no sense of humour. He was so proud of his natural garment of yellow hair that he had put on no waistcoat, in order that no one might have a doubt as to where he sprang from. For the same reason, he had kept his collar, with his address on it. A big red velvet coat, heavily braided with gold-lace, reached to his knees; and the large pockets on either side would enable him, he thought, always to carry a few provisions; for Tyllo was very greedy. On his left ear, he wore a little round cap with an osprey-feather in it and he kept it on his big square head by means of an elastic which cut his fat, loose cheeks in two. His other ear remained free. Cropped close to his head in the shape of a little paper screw-bag, this ear was the watchful receiver into which all the sounds of life fell, like pebbles disturbing its rest.

He had also encased his hind-legs in a pair of patent-leather riding-boots, with white tops; but his fore-paws he considered of such use that nothing would have induced him to put them into gloves. Tyllo had too natural a character to change his little ways all in a day; and, in spite of his new-blown honours, he allowed himself to do undignified things. He was at the present moment lying on the steps of the hall, scratching the ground and sniffing at the wall, when suddenly he gave a start and began to whine and whimper! His lower lip shook nervously as though he were going to cry.

“What’s the matter with the idiot now?” asked the Cat, who was watching him out of the corner of her eye.

But she at once understood. A very sweet song came from the distance; and Tyllo could not endure music. The song drew nearer, a girl’s fresh voice filled the shadows of the lofty arches and Water appeared. Tall, slender and white as a pearl, she seemed to glide rather than to walk. Her movements were so soft and graceful that they were suspected rather than seen. A beautiful silvery dress waved and floated around her; and her hair decked with corals flowed below her knees.

When Fire caught sight of her, like the rude and spiteful fellow that he was, he sneered:

“She’s not brought her umbrella!”

But Water, who was really quite witty and who knew that she was the stronger of the two, chaffed him pleasantly and said, with a glance at his glowing nose:

“I beg your pardon?... I thought you might be speaking of a great red nose I saw the other day!...”

The others began to laugh and poke fun at Fire, whose face was always like a red-hot coal. Fire angrily jumped to the ceiling, keeping his revenge for later. Meanwhile, the Cat went up to Water, very cautiously, and paid her ever so many compliments on her dress. I need hardly tell you that she did not mean a word of it; but she wished to be friendly with everybody, for she wanted their votes, to carry out her plan; and she was anxious at not seeing Bread, because she did not want to speak before the meeting was complete:

“What can he be doing?” she mewed, time after time.

“He was making an endless fuss about choosing his dress,” said the Dog. “At last, he decided in favour of a Turkish robe, with a scimitar and a turban.”

The words were not out of his mouth, when a shapeless and ridiculous bulk, clad in all the colours of the rainbow, came and blocked the narrow door of the hall. It was the enormous stomach of Bread, who filled the whole opening. He kept on knocking himself, without knowing why; for he was not very clever and, besides, he was not yet used to moving about in human beings’ houses. At last, it occurred to him to stoop; and, by squeezing through sideways, he managed to make his way into the hall.

It was certainly not a triumphal entry, but he was pleased with it all the same:

“Here I am!” he said. “Here I am! I have put on Blue-beard’s finest dress.... What do you think of this?”

The Dog began to frisk around him: he thought Bread magnificent! That yellow velvet costume, covered all over with silver crescents, reminded Tyllo of the delicious horseshoe rolls which he loved; and the huge, gaudy turban on Bread’s head was really very like a fairy bun!

“How nice he looks!” he cried. “How nice he looks!”

Bread was shyly followed by Milk. Her simple mind had made her prefer her cream dress to all the finery which the Fairy suggested to her. She was really a model of humility.

Bread was beginning to talk about the dresses of Tyltyl, Light and Mytyl, when the Cat cut him short in a masterful voice:

“We shall see them in good time,” she said. “Stop chattering, listen to me, time presses: our future is at stake....”

They all looked at her with a bewildered air. They understood that it was a solemn moment, but the human language was still full of mystery to them. Sugar wriggled his long fingers as a sign of distress; Bread patted his huge stomach; Water lay on the floor and seemed to suffer from the most profound despair; and Milk only had eyes for Bread, who had been her friend for ages and ages.

The Cat, becoming impatient, continued her speech:

“The Fairy has just said it, the end of this journey will, at the same time, mark the end of our lives. It is our business, therefore, to spin the journey out as long as possible and by every means in our power....”

Bread, who was afraid of being eaten as soon as he was no longer a man, hastened to express approval; but the Dog, who was standing a little way off, pretending not to hear, began to growl deep down in his soul. He well knew what the Cat was driving at; and, when Tylette ended her speech with the words, “We must at all costs prolong the journey and prevent Blue Bird from being found, even if it means endangering the lives of the Children,” the good Dog, obeying only the promptings of his heart, leapt at the Cat to bite her. Sugar, Bread and Fire flung themselves between them:

“Order! Order!” said Bread pompously. “I’m in the chair at this meeting.”

“Who made you chairman?” stormed Fire.

“Who asked you to interfere?” asked Water, whirling her wet hair over Fire.

“Excuse me,” said Sugar, shaking all over, in conciliatory tones. “Excuse me.... This is a serious moment.... Let us talk things over in a friendly way.”

“I quite agree with Sugar and the Cat,” said Bread, as though that ended the matter.

“This is ridiculous!” said the Dog, barking and showing his teeth. “There is Man and that’s all!... We have to obey him and do as he tells us!... I recognise no one but him!... Hurrah for Man!... Man for ever!... In life or death, all for Man!... Man is everything!...”

But the Cat’s shrill voice rose above all the others. She was full of grudges against Man and she wanted to make use of the short spell of humanity which she now enjoyed to avenge her whole race:

“All of us here present,” she cried, “Animals, Things and Elements, possess a soul which Man does not yet know. That is why we retain a remnant of independence; but, if he finds the Blue Bird, he will know all, he will see all and we shall be completely at his mercy.... Remember the time when we wandered at liberty upon the face of the earth!...” But, suddenly her face changed, her voice sank to a whisper and she hissed, “Look out! I hear the Fairy and Light coming. I need hardly tell you that Light has taken sides with Man and means to stand by him; she is our worst enemy.... Be careful!”

But our friends had had no practice in trickery and, feeling themselves in the wrong, took up such ridiculous and uncomfortable attitudes that the Fairy, the moment she appeared upon the threshold, exclaimed:

“What are you doing in that corner?... You look like a pack of conspirators!”

Quite scared and thinking that the Fairy had already guessed their wicked intentions, they fell upon their knees before her. Luckily for them, the Fairy hardly gave a thought to what was passing through their little minds. She had come to explain the first part of the journey to the Children and to tell each of the others what to do. Tyltyl and Mytyl stood hand in hand in front of her, looking a little frightened and a little awkward in their fine clothes. They stared at each other in childish admiration.

The little girl was wearing a yellow silk frock embroidered with pink posies and covered with gold spangles. On her head was a lovely orange velvet cap; and a starched muslin tucker covered her little arms. Tyltyl was dressed in a red jacket and blue knickerbockers, both of velvet; and of course he wore the wonderful little hat on his head.

The Fairy said to them:

“It is just possible that the Blue Bird is hiding at your grandparents’ in the Land of Memory; so you will go there first.”

“But how shall we see them, if they are dead?” asked Tyltyl.

Then the good Fairy explained that they would not be really dead until their grandchildren ceased to think of them:

“Men do not know this secret,” she added. “But, thanks to the diamond, you, Tyltyl, will see that the dead whom we remember live as happily as though they were not dead.”

“Are you coming with us?” asked the boy, turning to Light, who stood in the doorway and lit up all the hall.

“No,” said the Fairy. “Light must not look at the past. Her energies must be devoted to the future!”

The two Children were starting on their way, when they discovered that they were very hungry. The Fairy at once ordered Bread to give them something to eat; and that big, fat fellow, delighted with the importance of his duty, undid the top of his robe, drew his scimitar and cut two slices out of his stomach. The Children screamed with laughter. Tyllo dropped his gloomy thoughts for a moment and begged for a bit of bread; and everybody struck up the farewell chorus. Sugar, who was very full of himself, also wanted to impress the company and, breaking off two of his fingers, handed them to the astonished Children.

As they were all moving towards the door, the Fairy Berylune stopped them:

“Not today,” she said. “The children must go alone. It would be indiscreet to accompany them; they are going to spend the evening with their late family. Come, be off! Good-bye, dear children, and mind that you are back in good time: it is extremely important!”

The two Children took each other by the hand and, carrying the big cage, passed out of the hall; and their companions, at a sign from the Fairy, filed in front of her to return to the palace. Our friend Tyllo was the only one who did not answer to his name. The moment he heard the Fairy say that the Children were to go alone, he had made up his mind to go and look after them, whatever happened; and, while the others were saying good-bye, he hid behind the door. But the poor fellow had reckoned without the all-seeing eyes of the Fairy Berylune.

“Tyllo!” she cried. “Tyllo! Here!”

And the poor Dog, who had so long been used to obey, dared not resist the command and came, with his tail between his legs, to take his place among the others. He howled with despair when he saw his little master and mistress swallowed up in the great gold staircase.





Chapter 3　THE LAND OF MEMORY


THE Fairy Berylune had told the Children that the Land of Memory was not far off; but to reach it you had to go through a forest that was so dense and so old that your eyes could not see the tops of the trees. It was always shrouded in a heavy mist; and the Children would certainly have lost their way, if the Fairy had not said to them beforehand:

“It is straight ahead; and there is only one road.”

The ground was carpeted with flowers which were all alike: they were snow-white pansies and very pretty; but, as they never saw the sun, they had no scent.

Those little flowers comforted the Children, who felt extremely lonely. A great mysterious silence surrounded them; and they trembled a little with a very pleasant sense of fear which they had never felt before.

“Let’s take Granny a bunch of flowers,” said Mytyl.

“That’s a good idea! She will be pleased!” cried Tyltyl.

And, as they walked along, the Children gathered a beautiful white nosegay. The dear little things did not know that every pansy (which means “a thought”) that they picked brought them nearer to their grandparents; and they soon saw before them a large oak with a notice-board nailed to it.

“Here we are!” cried the boy in triumph, as, climbing up on a root, he read: “The Land of Memory.”

They had arrived; but they turned to every side without seeing a thing:

“I can see nothing at all!” whimpered Mytyl. “I’m cold!... I’m tired!... I don’t want to travel any more!”

Tyltyl, who was wholly wrapped up in his errand, lost his temper:

“Come, don’t keep on crying just like Water!... You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” he said. “There! Look! Look! The fog is lifting!”

And, sure enough, the mist parted before their eyes, like veils torn by an invisible hand; the big trees faded away, everything vanished and, instead, there appeared a pretty little peasant’s cottage, covered with creepers and standing in a little garden filled with flowers and with trees all over fruit.

The Children at once knew the dear cow in the orchard, the watch-dog at the door, the blackbird in his wicker cage; and everything was steeped in a pale light and a warm and balmy air.

Tyltyl and Mytyl stood amazed. So that was the Land of Memory! What lovely weather it was! And how nice it felt to be there! They at once made up their minds to come back often, now that they knew the way. But how great was their happiness when the last veil disappeared and they saw, at a few steps from them, Grandad and Granny sitting on a bench, sound asleep. They clapped their hands and called out gleefully:

“It’s Grandad! It’s Granny!... There they are! There they are!”

But they were a little scared by this great piece of magic and dared not move from behind the tree; and they stood looking at the dear old couple, who woke up gently and slowly under their eyes. Then they heard Granny Tyl’s trembling voice say:

“I have a notion that our grandchildren who are still alive are coming to see us today.”

And Gaffer Tyl answered:

“They are certainly thinking of us, for I feel queer and I have pins and needles in my legs.”

“I think they must be quite near,” said Granny, “for I see tears of joy dancing before my eyes and....”

Granny had not time to finish her sentence. The Children were in her arms!... What joy! What wild kisses and huggings! What a wonderful surprise! The happiness was too great for words. They laughed and tried to speak and kept on looking at one another with delighted eyes: it was so glorious and so unexpected to meet again like this. When the first excitement was over, they all began to talk at once:

“How tall and strong you’ve grown, Tyltyl!” said Granny.

And Grandad cried:

“And Mytyl! Just look at her! What pretty hair, what pretty eyes!”

And the Children danced and clapped their hands and flung themselves by turns into the arms of one or the other.

At last, they quieted down a little; and, with Mytyl nestling against Grandad’s chest and Tyltyl comfortably perched on Granny’s knees, they began to talk of family affairs:

“How are Daddy and Mummy Tyl?” asked Granny.

“Quite well, Granny,” said Tyltyl. “They were asleep when we went out.”

Granny gave them fresh kisses and said:

“My word, how pretty they are and how nice and clean!... Why don’t you come to see us oftener? It is months and months now that you have forgotten us and that we have seen nobody....”

“We couldn’t, Granny,” said Tyltyl, “and today it’s only because of the Fairy....”

“We are always here,” said Granny Tyl, “waiting for a visit from those who are alive. The last time you were here was on All-hallows....”

“All-hallows? We didn’t go out that day, for we both had colds!”

“But you thought of us! And, every time you think of us, we wake up and see you again.”

Tyltyl remembered that the Fairy had told him this. He had not thought it possible then; but now, with his head on the heart of the dear Granny whom he had missed so much, he began to understand things and he felt that his grandparents had not left him altogether. He asked:

“So you are not really dead?...”

The old couple burst out laughing. When they exchanged their life on earth for another and a much nicer and more beautiful life, they had forgotten the word “dead.”

“What does that word ‘dead’ mean?” asked Gaffer Tyl.

“Why, it means that one’s no longer alive!” said Tyltyl.

Grandad and Granny only shrugged their shoulders:

“How stupid the Living are, when they speak of the Others!” was all they said.

And they went over their memories again, rejoicing in being able to chat.

All old people love discussing old times. The future is finished, as far as they are concerned; and so they delight in the present and the past. But we are growing impatient, like Tyltyl; and, instead of listening to them, we will follow our little friend’s movements.

He had jumped off Granny’s knees and was poking about in every corner, delighted at finding all sorts of things which he knew and remembered:

“Nothing is changed, everything is in its old place!” he cried. And, as he had not been to the old people’s home for so long, everything struck him as much nicer; and he added, in the voice of one who knows, “Only everything is prettier!... Hullo, there’s the clock with the big hand which I broke the point off and the hole which I made in the door, the day I found Grandad’s gimlet....”

“Yes, you’ve done some damage in your time!” said Grandad. “And there’s the plum-tree which you were so fond of climbing, when I wasn’t looking....”

Meantime, Tyltyl was not forgetting his errand:

“You haven’t the Blue Bird here by chance, I suppose?”

At the same moment, Mytyl, lifting her head, saw a cage:

“Hullo, there’s the old blackbird!... Does he still sing?”

As she spoke, the blackbird woke up and began to sing at the top of his voice.

“You see,” said Granny, “as soon as one thinks of him....”

Tyltyl was simply amazed at what he saw:

“But he’s blue!” he shouted. “Why, that’s the bird, the Blue Bird!... He’s blue, blue, blue as a blue glass marble!... Will you give him to me?”

The grandparents gladly consented; and, full of triumph, Tyltyl went and fetched the cage which he had left by the tree. He took hold of the precious bird with the greatest of care; and it began to hop about in its new home.

“How pleased the Fairy will be!” said the boy, rejoicing at his conquest. “And Light too!”

“Come along,” said the grandparents. “Come and look at the cow and the bees.”

As the old couple were beginning to toddle across the garden, the children suddenly asked if their little dead brothers and sisters were there too. At the same moment, seven little children, who, up to then, had been sleeping in the house, came tearing like mad into the garden. Tyltyl and Mytyl ran up to them. They all hustled and hugged one another and danced and whirled about and uttered screams of joy.

“Here they are, here they are!” said Granny. “As soon as you speak of them, they are there, the imps!”

Tyltyl caught a little one by the hair:

“Hullo, Pierrot! So we’re going to fight again, as in the old days!... And Robert!... I say, Jean, what’s become of your top?... Madeleine and Pierrette and Pauline!... And here’s Riquette!...”

Mytyl laughed:

“Riquette’s still crawling on all fours!”

Tyltyl noticed a little dog yapping around them:

“There’s Kiki, whose tail I cut off with Pauline’s scissors.... He hasn’t changed either....”

“No,” said Gaffer Tyl, in a voice of great importance, “nothing changes here!”

But, suddenly, amid the general rejoicings, the old people stopped spell-bound: they had heard the small voice of the clock indoors strike eight!

“How’s this?” they asked. “It never strikes nowadays....”

“That’s because we no longer think of the time,” said Granny. “Was any one thinking of the time?”

“Yes, I was,” said Tyltyl. “So it’s eight o’clock?... Then I’m off, for I promised Light to be back before nine....”

He was going for the cage, but the others were too happy to let him run away so soon: it would be horrid to say good-bye like that! Granny had a good idea: she knew what a little glutton Tyltyl was. It was just supper-time and, as luck would have it, there was some capital cabbage-soup and a beautiful plum-tart.

“Well,” said our hero, “as I’ve got the Blue Bird!... And cabbage-soup is a thing you don’t have every day!...”

They all hurried and carried the table outside and laid it with a nice white table-cloth and put a plate for each; and, lastly, Granny brought out the steaming soup-tureen in state. The lamp was lit and the grandparents and grandchildren sat down to supper, jostling and elbowing one another and laughing and shouting with pleasure. Then, for a time, nothing was heard but the sound of the wooden spoons noisily clattering against the soup-plates.

“How good it is! Oh, how good it is!” shouted Tyltyl, who was eating greedily. “I want some more! More! More! More!”

“Come, come, a little more quiet,” said Grandad. “You’re just as ill-behaved as ever; and you’ll break your plate....”

Tyltyl took no notice of the remark, stood up on his stool, caught hold of the tureen and dragged it towards him and upset it; and the hot soup trickled all over the table and down upon everybody’s lap. The children yelled and screamed with pain. Granny was quite scared; and Grandad was furious. He dealt our friend Tyltyl a tremendous box on the ear.

Tyltyl was staggered for a moment; and then he put his hand to his cheek with a look of rapture and exclaimed:

“Grandad, how good, how jolly! It was just like the slaps you used to give me when you were alive!... I must give you a kiss for it!...”

Everybody laughed.

“There’s more where that came from, if you like them!” said Grandad, grumpily.

But he was touched, all the same, and turned to wipe a tear from his eyes.

“Goodness!” cried Tyltyl, starting up. “There’s half-past eight striking!... Mytyl, we’ve only just got time!...”

Granny in vain implored them to stay a few minutes longer.

“No, we can’t possibly,” said Tyltyl firmly, “I promised Light!”

And he hurried to take up the precious cage.

“Good-bye, Grandad.... Good-bye, Granny.... Good-bye, brothers and sisters, Pierrot, Robert, Pauline, Madeleine, Riquette and you, too, Kiki.... We can’t stay.... Don’t cry, Granny; we will come back often!”

Poor old Grandad was very much upset and complained lustily:

“Gracious me, how tiresome the Living are, with all their fuss and excitement!”

Tyltyl tried to console him and again promised to come back very often.

“Come back every day!” said Granny. “It is our only pleasure; and it’s such a treat for us when your thoughts pay us a visit!”

“Good-bye! Good-bye!” cried the brothers and sisters in chorus. “Come back very soon! Bring us some barley sugar!”

There were more kisses; all waved their handkerchiefs; all shouted a last good-bye. But the figures began to fade away; the little voices could no longer be heard; the two Children were once more wrapped in mist; and the old forest covered them with its great dark mantle.

“I’m so frightened!” whimpered Mytyl. “Give me your hand, little brother! I’m so frightened!”

Tyltyl was shaking too, but it was his duty to try and comfort and console his sister:

“Hush!” he said. “Remember that we are bringing back the Blue Bird!”

As he spoke, a thin ray of light pierced the gloom; and the little boy hurried towards it. He was holding his cage tight in his arms; and the first thing he did was to look at his bird.... Alas and alack, what a disappointment awaited him! The beautiful Blue Bird of the Land of Memory had turned quite black! Stare at it as hard as Tyltyl might, the bird was black! Oh, how well he knew the old blackbird that used to sing in its wicker prison, in the old days, at the door of the house! What had happened? How painful it was! And how cruel life seemed to him just then!

He had started on his journey with such zest and delight that he had not thought for a moment of the difficulties and dangers. Full of confidence, pluck and kindness, he had marched off, certain of finding the beautiful Blue Bird which would bring happiness to the Fairy’s little girl. And now all his hopes were shattered! For the first time, our poor friend understood the trials, the vexations and the obstacles that awaited him! Alas, was he attempting an impossible thing? Was the Fairy making fun of him? Would he ever find the Blue Bird? All his courage seemed to be leaving him....

To add to his misfortunes, he could not find the straight road by which he had come. There was not a single white pansy on the ground; and he began to cry.

Luckily, our little friends were not to remain in trouble long. The Fairy had promised that Light would watch over them. The first trial was over; and, just as outside the old people’s house a little while ago, the mist now suddenly lifted. But, instead of disclosing a peaceful picture, a gentle, homely scene, it revealed a marvellous temple, with a blinding glare streaming from it.

On the threshold stood Light, fair and beautiful in her diamond-coloured dress. She smiled when Tyltyl told her of his first failure. She knew what the little ones were seeking; she knew everything. For Light surrounds all mortals with her love, though none of them is fond enough of her ever to receive her thoroughly and thus to learn all the secrets of Truth. Now, for the first time, thanks to the diamond which the Fairy had given to the boy, she was going to try and conquer a human soul:

“Do not be sad,” she said to the Children. “Are you not pleased to have seen your grandparents? Is that not enough happiness for one day? Are you not glad to have restored the old blackbird to life? Listen to him singing!”

For the old blackbird was singing with might and main; and his little yellow eyes sparkled with pleasure as he hopped about his big cage.

“As you look for the Blue Bird, dear Children, accustom yourselves to love the grey birds which you find on your way.”

She nodded her fair head gravely; and it was quite clear that she knew where the Blue Bird was. But life is often full of beautiful mysteries, which we must respect, lest we should destroy them; and, if Light had told the Children where the Blue Bird was, well, they would never have found him! I will tell you why at the end of this story.

And now let us leave our little friends to sleep on beautiful white clouds under Light’s watchful care.





Chapter 4　THE PALACE OF NIGHT


SOME time after, the Children and their friends met at the first dawn to go to the Palace of Night, where they hoped to find the Blue Bird. Several of the party failed to answer to their names when the roll was called. Milk, for whom any sort of excitement was bad, was keeping her room. Water sent an excuse: she was accustomed always to travel in a bed of moss, was already half-dead with fatigue and was afraid of falling ill. As for Light, she had been on bad terms with Night since the world began; and Fire, as a relation, shared her dislike. Light kissed the Children and told Tyllo the way, for it was his business to lead the expedition; and the little band set out upon its road.

You can imagine dear Tyllo trotting ahead, on his hind-legs, like a little man, with his nose in the air, his tongue dangling down his chin, his front paws folded across his chest. He fidgets, sniffs about, runs up and down, covering twice the ground without minding how tired it makes him. He is so full of his own importance that he disdains the temptations on his path: he neglects the rubbish heaps, pays no attention to anything he sees and cuts all his old friends.

Poor Tyllo! He was so delighted to become a man; and yet he was no happier than before! Of course, life was the same to him, because his nature had remained unchanged. What was the use of his being a man, if he continued to feel and think like a dog? In fact, his troubles were increased a hundred-fold by the sense of responsibility that now weighed upon him.

“Ah!” he said, with a sigh, for he was joining blindly in his little gods’ search, without for a moment reflecting that the end of the journey would mean the end of his life. “Ah,” he said, “if I got hold of that rascal of a Blue Bird, trust me, I wouldn’t touch him even with the tip of my tongue, not if he were as plump and sweet as a quail!”

Bread followed solemnly, carrying the cage; the two Children came next; and Sugar brought up the rear.

But where was the Cat? To discover the reason of her absence, we must go a little way back and read her thoughts. At the time when Tylette called a meeting of the Animals and Things in the Fairy’s hall, she was contemplating a great plot which would aim at prolonging the journey; but she had reckoned without the stupidity of her hearers:

“The idiots,” she thought, “have very nearly spoiled the whole thing by foolishly throwing themselves at the Fairy’s feet, as though they were guilty of a crime. It is better to rely upon one’s self alone. In my cat-life, all our training is founded on suspicion; I can see that it is just the same in the life of men. Those who confide in others are only betrayed; it is better to keep silent and to be treacherous one’s self.”

As you see, my dear little readers, the Cat was in the same position as the Dog: she had not changed her soul and was simply continuing her former existence; but, of course, she was very wicked, whereas our dear Tyllo was, if anything, too good. Tylette, therefore, resolved to act on her own account and went, before daybreak, to call on Night, who was an old friend of hers.

The road to the Palace of Night was rather long and rather dangerous. It had precipices on either side of it; you had to climb up and climb down and then climb up again among high rocks that always seemed waiting to crush the passers-by. At last, you came to the edge of a dark circle; and there you had to go down thousands of steps to reach the black-marble underground palace in which Night lived.

The Cat, who had often been there before, raced along the road, light as a feather. Her cloak, borne on the wind, streamed like a banner behind her; the plume in her hat fluttered gracefully; and her little grey kid boots hardly touched the ground. She soon reached her destination and, in a few bounds, came to the great hall where Night was.

It was really a wonderful sight. Night, stately and grand as a Queen, reclined upon her throne; she slept; and not a glimmer, not a star twinkled around her. But we know that the night has no secrets for cats and that their eyes have the power of piercing the darkness. So Tylette saw Night as though it were broad daylight.

Before waking her, she cast a loving glance at that motherly and familiar face. It was white and silvery as the moon; and its unbending features inspired both fear and admiration. Night’s figure, which was half visible through her long black veils, was as beautiful as that of a Greek statue. She had long arms and a pair of enormous wings, now furled in sleep, came from her shoulders to her feet and gave her a look of majesty beyond compare. Still, in spite of her affection for her best of friends, Tylette did not waste too much time in gazing at her: it was a critical moment; and time was short. Tired and jaded and overcome with anguish, she sank upon the steps of the throne and mewed, plaintively:

“It is I, Mother Night!... I am worn out!”

Night is of an anxious nature and easily alarmed. Her beauty, built up of peace and repose, possesses the secret of Silence, which life is constantly disturbing: a star shooting through the sky, a leaf falling to the ground, the hoot of an owl, a mere nothing is enough to tear the black velvet pall which she spreads over the earth each evening. The Cat, therefore, had not finished speaking, when Night sat up, all quivering. Her immense wings beat around her; and she questioned Tylette in a trembling voice. As soon as she had learnt the danger that threatened her, she began to lament her fate. What! A man’s son coming to her palace! And, perhaps, with the help of the magic diamond, discovering her secrets! What should she do? What would become of her? How could she defend herself? And, forgetting that she was sinning against Silence, her own particular god, Night began to utter piercing screams. It was true that falling into such a commotion was hardly likely to help her find a cure for her troubles. Luckily for her, Tylette, who was accustomed to the annoyances and worries of human life, was better armed. She had worked out her plan when going ahead of the children; and she was hoping to persuade Night to adopt it. She explained this plan to her in a few words:

“I see only one thing for it, Mother Night: as they are children, we must give them such a fright that they will not dare to insist on opening the great door at the back of the hall, behind which the Birds of the Moon live and generally the Blue Bird too. The secrets of the other caverns will be sure to scare them. The hope of our safety lies in the terror which you will make them feel.”

There was clearly no other course to take. But Night had not time to reply, for she heard a sound. Then her beautiful features contracted; her wings spread out angrily; and everything in her attitude told Tylette that Night approved of her plan.

“Here they are!” cried the Cat.

The little band came marching down the steps of Night’s gloomy staircase. Tyllo pranced bravely in front, whereas Tyltyl looked around him with an anxious glance. He certainly found nothing to comfort him. It was all very magnificent, but very terrifying. Picture a huge and wonderful black marble hall, of a stern and tomb-like splendour. There is no ceiling visible; and the ebony pillars that surround the amphitheatre shoot up to the sky. It is only when you lift your eyes up there that you catch the faint light falling from the stars. Everywhere, the thickest darkness reigns. Two restless flames—no more—flicker on either side of Night’s throne, before a monumental door of brass. Bronze doors show through the pillars to the right and left.

The Cat rushed up to the Children:

“This way, little master, this way!... I have told Night; and she is delighted to see you.”

Tylette’s soft voice and smile made Tyltyl feel himself again; and he walked up to the throne with a bold and confident step, saying:

“Good-day, Mrs. Night!”

Night was offended by the word, “Good-day,” which reminded her of her eternal enemy Light, and answered drily:

“Good-day?... I am not used to that!... You might say, Good-night, or, at least, Good-evening!”

Our hero was not prepared to quarrel. He felt very small in the presence of that stately lady. He quickly begged her pardon, as nicely as he could; and very gently asked her leave to look for the Blue Bird in her palace.

“I have never seen him, he is not here!” exclaimed Night, flapping her great wings to frighten the boy.

But, when he insisted and gave no sign of fear, she herself began to dread the diamond, which, by lighting up her darkness, would completely destroy her power; and she thought it better to pretend to yield to an impulse of generosity and at once to point to the big key that lay on the steps of the throne.

Without a moment’s hesitation, Tyltyl seized hold of it and ran to the first door of the hall.

Everybody shook with fright. Bread’s teeth chattered in his head; Sugar, who was standing some way off, moaned with mortal anguish; Mytyl howled:

“Where is Sugar?... I want to go home!”

Meanwhile, Tyltyl, pale and resolute, was trying to open the door, while Night’s grave voice, rising above the din, proclaimed the first danger.

“It’s the Ghosts!”

“Oh, dear!” thought Tyltyl. “I have never seen a ghost: it must be awful!”

The faithful Tyllo, by his side, was panting with all his might, for dogs hate anything uncanny.

At last, the key grated in the lock. Silence reigned as dense and heavy as the darkness. No one dared draw a breath. Then the door opened; and, in a moment, the gloom was filled with white figures running in every direction. Some lengthened out right up to the sky; others twined themselves round the pillars; others wriggled ever so fast along the ground. They were something like men, but it was impossible to distinguish their features; the eye could not catch them. The moment you looked at them, they turned into a white mist. Tyltyl did his best to chase them; for Mrs. Night kept to the plan contrived by the Cat and pretended to be frightened. She had been the Ghosts’ friend for hundreds and hundreds of years and had only to say a word to drive them in again; but she was careful to do nothing of the sort and, flapping her wings like mad, she called upon all her gods and screamed:

“Drive them away! Drive them away! Help! Help!”

But the poor Ghosts, who hardly ever come out now that Man no longer believes in them, were much too happy at taking a breath of air; and, had it not been that they were afraid of Tyllo, who tried to bite their legs, they would never have been put back indoors.

“Oof!” gasped the Dog, when the door was shut at last. “I have strong teeth, goodness knows; but chaps like those I never saw before! When you bite them, you’d think their legs were made of cotton!”

By this time, Tyltyl was making for the second door and asking:

“What’s behind this one?”

Night made a gesture as though to put him off. Did the obstinate little fellow really want to see everything?

“Must I be careful when I open it?” asked Tyltyl.

“No,” said Night, “it is not worth while. It’s the Sicknesses. They are very quiet, the poor little things! Man, for some time, has been waging such war upon them!... Open and see for yourself....”

Tyltyl threw the door wide open and stood speechless with astonishment: there was nothing to be seen....

He was just about to close the door again, when he was hustled aside by a little body in a dressing-gown and a cotton night-cap, who began to frisk about the hall, wagging her head and stopping every minute to cough, sneeze and blow her nose ... and to pull on her slippers, which were too big for her and kept dropping off her feet. Sugar, Bread and Tyltyl were no longer frightened and began to laugh like anything. But they had no sooner come near the little person in the cotton night-cap than they themselves began to cough and sneeze.

“It’s the least important of the Sicknesses,” said Night. “It’s Cold-in-the-Head.”

“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” thought Sugar. “If my nose keeps on running like this, I’m done for: I shall melt!”

Poor Sugar! He did not know where to hide himself. He had become very much attached to life since the journey began, for he had fallen over head and ears in love with Water! And yet this love caused him the greatest worry. Miss Water was a tremendous flirt, expected a lot of attention and was not particular with whom she mixed; but mixing too much with Water was an expensive luxury, as poor Sugar found to his cost; for, at every kiss he gave her, he left a bit of himself behind, until he began to tremble for his life.

When he suddenly found himself attacked by Cold-in-the-Head, he would have had to fly from the palace, but for the timely aid of our dear Tyllo, who ran after the little minx and drove her back to her cavern, amidst the laughter of Tyltyl and Mytyl, who thought gleefully that, so far, the trial had not been very terrible.

The boy, therefore, ran to the next door with still greater courage.

“Take care!” cried Night, in a dreadful voice. “It’s the Wars! They are more powerful than ever! I daren’t think what would happen, if one of them broke loose! Stand ready, all of you, to push back the door!”

Night had not finished uttering her warnings, when the plucky little fellow repented his rashness. He tried in vain to shut the door which he had opened: an invincible force was pushing it from the other side, streams of blood flowed through the cracks; flames shot forth; shouts, oaths and groans mingled with the roar of cannon and the rattle of musketry. Everybody in the Palace of Night was running about in wild confusion. Bread and Sugar tried to take to flight, but could not find the way out; and they now came back to Tyltyl and put their shoulders to the door with despairing force.

The Cat pretended to be anxious, while secretly rejoicing:

“This may be the end of it,” she said, curling her whiskers. “They won’t dare to go on after this.”

Dear Tyllo made superhuman efforts to help his little master, while Mytyl stood crying in a corner.

At last, our hero gave a shout of triumph:

“Hurrah! They’re giving way! Victory! Victory! The door is shut!”

At the same time, he dropped on the steps, utterly exhausted, dabbing his forehead with his poor little hands which shook with terror.

“Well?” asked Night, harshly. “Have you had enough? Did you see them?”

“Yes, yes!” replied the little fellow, sobbing. “They are hideous and awful.... I don’t think they have the Blue Bird....”

“You may be sure they haven’t,” answered Night, angrily. “If they had, they would eat him at once.... You see there is nothing to be done....”

Tyltyl drew himself up proudly:

“I must see everything,” he declared. “Light said so....”

“It’s an easy thing to say,” retorted Night, “when one’s afraid and stays at home!”

“Let us go to the next door,” said Tyltyl, resolutely. “What’s in here?”

“This is where I keep the Shades and the Terrors!”

Tyltyl reflected for a minute:

“As far as Shades go,” he thought, “Mrs. Night is poking fun at me. It’s more than an hour since I’ve seen anything but shade in this house of hers; and I shall be very glad to see daylight again. As for the Terrors, if they are anything like the Ghosts, we shall have another good joke.”

Our friend went to the door and opened it, before his companions had time to protest. For that matter, they were all sitting on the floor, exhausted with the last fright; and they looked at one another in astonishment, glad to find themselves alive after such a scare. Meanwhile, Tyltyl threw back the door and nothing came out:

“There’s no one there!” he said.

“Yes, there is! Yes, there is! Look out!” said Night, who was still shamming fright.

She was simply furious. She had hoped to make a great impression with her Terrors; and, lo and behold, the wretches, who had so long been snubbed by Man, were afraid of him! She encouraged them with kind words and succeeded in coaxing out a few tall figures covered with grey veils. They began to run all around the hall until, hearing the Children laugh, they were seized with fear and rushed indoors again. The attempt had failed, as far as Night was concerned, and the dread hour was about to strike. Already, Tyltyl was moving towards the big door at the end of the hall. A few last words took place between them:

“Do not open that one!” said Night, in awe-struck tones.

“Why not?”

“Because it’s not allowed!”

“Then it’s here that the Blue Bird is hidden!”

“Go no farther, do not tempt fate, do not open that door!”

“But why?” again asked Tyltyl, obstinately.

Thereupon, Night, irritated by his persistency, flew into a rage, hurled the most terrible threats at him, and ended by saying:

“Not one of those who have opened it, were it but by a hair’s breadth, has ever returned alive to the light of day! It means certain death; and all the horrors, all the terrors, all the fears of which men speak on earth are as nothing compared with those which await you if you insist on touching that door!”

“Don’t do it, master dear!” said Bread, with chattering teeth. “Don’t do it! Take pity on us! I implore you on my knees!”

“You are sacrificing the lives of all of us,” mewed the Cat.

“I won’t! I shan’t!” sobbed Mytyl.

“Pity! Pity!” whined Sugar, wringing his fingers.

All of them were weeping and crying, all of them crowded round Tyltyl. Dear Tyllo alone, who respected his little master’s wishes, dared not speak a word, though he fully believed that his last hour had come. Two big tears rolled down his cheeks; and he licked Tyltyl’s hands in despair. It was really a most touching scene; and for a moment, our hero hesitated. His heart beat wildly, his throat was parched with anguish, he tried to speak and could not get out a sound: besides, he did not wish to show weakness in the presence of his hapless companions!

“If I have not the strength to fulfil my task,” he said to himself, “who will fulfil it? If my friends behold my distress, it is all up with me: they will not let me go through with my mission and I shall never find the Blue Bird!”

At this thought, the boy’s heart leapt within his breast and all his generous nature rose in rebellion. It would never do to be, perhaps, within arm’s length of happiness and not to try for it, at the risk of dying in the attempt, to try for it and hand it over at last to all mankind!

That settled it! Tyltyl resolved to sacrifice himself. Like a true hero, he brandished the heavy golden key and cried:

“I must open the door!”

He ran up to the great door, with Tyllo panting by his side. The poor Dog was half-dead with fright, but his pride and his devotion to Tyltyl obliged him to smother his fears:

“I shall stay,” he said to his master, “I’m not afraid! I shall stay with my little god!”

In the meantime, all the others had fled. Bread was crumbling to bits behind a pillar; Sugar was melting in a corner with Mytyl in his arms; Night and the Cat, both shaking with fury, kept to the far end of the hall.

Then Tyltyl gave Tyllo a last kiss, pressed him to his heart and, with never a tremble, put the key in the lock. Yells of terror came from all the corners of the hall, where the runaways had taken shelter, while the two leaves of the great door opened by magic in front of our little friend, who was struck dumb with admiration and delight. What an exquisite surprise! A wonderful garden lay before him, a dream-garden filled with flowers that shone like stars, waterfalls that came rushing from the sky and trees which the moon had clothed in silver. And then there was something whirling like a blue cloud among the clusters of roses. Tyltyl rubbed his eyes; he could not believe his senses. He waited, looked again and then dashed into the garden, shouting like mad:

“Come quickly!... Come quickly!... They are here!... We have them at last!... Millions of blue birds!... Thousands of millions!... Come, Mytyl!... Come, Tyllo!... Come, all!... Help me!... You can catch them by handfuls!...”

Reassured at last, his friends came running up and all darted in among the birds, seeing who could catch the most:

“I’ve caught seven already!” cried Mytyl. “I can’t hold them!”

“Nor can I!” said Tyltyl. “I have too many of them!... They’re escaping from my arms!... Tyllo has some too!... Let us go out, let us go!... Light is waiting for us!... How pleased she will be!... This way, this way!...”

And they all danced and scampered away in their glee, singing songs of triumph as they went.

Night and the Cat, who had not shared in the general rejoicing, crept back anxiously to the great door; and Night whimpered:

“Haven’t they got him?...”

“No,” said the Cat, who saw the real Blue Bird perched high up on a moonbeam.... “They could not reach him, he kept too high....”

Our friends in all haste ran up the numberless stairs between them and the daylight. Each of them hugged the birds which he had captured, never dreaming that every step which brought them nearer to the light was fatal to the poor things, so that, by the time they came to the top of the staircase, they were carrying nothing but dead birds.

Light was waiting for them anxiously:

“Well, have you caught him?” she asked.

“Yes, yes!” said Tyltyl. “Lots of them! There are thousands! Look!”

As he spoke, he held out the dear birds to her and saw, to his dismay, that they were nothing more than lifeless corpses; their poor little wings were broken and their heads drooped sadly from their necks! The boy, in his despair, turned to his companions. Alas, they too were hugging nothing but dead birds!

Then Tyltyl threw himself sobbing into Light’s arms. Once more, all his hopes were dashed to the ground.

“Do not cry, my child,” said Light. “You did not catch the one that is able to live in broad daylight.... We shall find him yet....”

“Of course, we shall find him,” said Bread and Sugar, with one voice.

They were great boobies, both of them; but they wanted to console the boy. As for friend Tyllo, he was so much put out that he forgot his dignity for a moment and, looking at the dead birds, exclaimed:

“Are they good to eat, I wonder?” The party set out to walk back and sleep in the Temple of Light. It was a melancholy journey; all regretted the peace of home and felt inclined to blame Tyltyl for his want of caution. Sugar edged up to Bread and whispered in his ear:

“Don’t you think, Mr. Chairman, that all this excitement is very useless?”

And Bread, who felt flattered at receiving so much attention, answered, pompously:

“Never you fear, my dear fellow, I shall put all this right. Life would be unbearable if we had to listen to all the whimsies of that little madcap!... To-morrow, we shall stay in bed!...”

They forgot that, but for the boy at whom they were sneering, they would never have been alive at all; and that, if he had suddenly told Bread that he must go back to his pan to be eaten and Sugar that he was to be cut into small lumps to sweeten Daddy Tyl’s coffee and Mummy Tyl’s syrups, they would have thrown themselves at their benefactor’s feet and begged for mercy. In fact, they were incapable of appreciating their good luck until they were brought face to face with bad.

Poor things! The Fairy Berylune, when making them a present of their human life, ought to have thrown in a little wisdom. They were not so much to blame. Of course, they were only following Man’s example. Given the power of speaking, they jabbered; knowing how to judge, they condemned; able to feel, they complained. They had hearts which increased their sense of fear, without adding to their happiness. As to their brains, which could easily have arranged all the rest, they made so little of them that they had already grown quite rusty; and, if you could have opened their heads and looked at the works of their life inside, you would have seen the poor brains, which were their most precious possession, jumping about at every movement they made and rattling in their empty skulls like dry peas in a pod.

Fortunately, Light, thanks to her wonderful insight, knew all about their state of mind. She determined, therefore, to employ the Elements and Things no more than she was obliged to. “They are useful,” she thought, “to feed the children and amuse them on the way; but they must have no further share in the trials, because they have neither courage nor conviction.”

Meanwhile, the party walked on, the road widened out and became resplendent; and, at the end, the Temple of Light stood on a crystal height, shedding its beams around. The tired Children made the Dog carry them pick-a-back by turns; and they were almost asleep when they reached the shining steps.





Chapter 5　THE KINGDOM OF THE FUTURE


TYLTYL and Mytyl woke up next morning, feeling very gay; with childish carelessness, they had forgotten their disappointment. Tyltyl was very proud of the compliments which Light had paid him; she seemed as happy as though he had brought the Blue Bird with him. She said, with a smile, as she stroked the lad’s dark curls:

“I am quite satisfied. You are such a good, brave boy that you will soon find what you are looking for.”

Tyltyl did not understand the deep meaning of her words; but, for all that, he was very glad to hear them. And, besides, Light had promised him that today he would have nothing to fear in their new expedition. On the contrary, he would meet millions and millions of little children who would show him the most wonderful toys of which no one on earth had the least idea. She also told him that he and his little sister would travel alone with her this time and that all the others would take a rest while they were gone.

That is why, at the moment when our chapter opens, they had all met in the underground vaults of the temple. Light thought it as well to lock up the Elements and Things. She knew that, if they were left to do as they pleased, they might escape and get into mischief. It was not so very cruel of her, because the vaults of her temple are even lighter and lovelier than the upper floors of human houses; but you cannot get out without her leave. She alone has the power of widening, with a stroke of her wand, a little cleft in an emerald wall at the end of the passage, through which you go down a few crystal steps till you come to a sort of cave, all green and transparent like a forest when the sunlight sweeps through its branches.

Usually, this great hall was quite empty; but now it had sofas in it and a gold table laid with fruits and cakes and creams and delicious wines, which Light’s servants had just finished setting out. Light’s servants were very odd! They always made the Children laugh: with their long white satin dresses and their little black caps with a flame at the top, they looked like lighted candles. Their mistress sent them away and then told the Animals and Things to be very good and asked them if they would like some books and games to play with; they answered, with a laugh, that nothing amused them more than eating and sleeping and that they were very glad to stay where they were.

Tyllo, of course, did not share this view. His heart spoke louder than his greed or his laziness; and his great dark eyes turned in entreaty on Tyltyl, who would have been only too pleased to take his faithful companion with him, if Light had not absolutely forbidden it:

“I can’t help it,” said the boy, giving him a kiss. “It seems that dogs are not admitted where we are going.”

Suddenly, Tyllo sprang up with delight: a great idea had struck him. He had not left his real, doggy life long enough to forget any part of it, especially his troubles. Which was the greatest of these? Was it not the chain? What melancholy hours Tyllo had spent fastened to an iron ring! And what humiliation he endured when the woodcutter used to take him to the village and, with unspeakable silliness, keep him on the lead in front of everybody, thus depriving him of the pleasure of greeting his friends and sniffing the smells provided for his benefit at every street-corner and in every gutter:

“Well,” he said to himself, “I shall have to submit to that humiliating torture once again, to go with my little god!”

Faithful to his traditions, he had, in spite of his fine clothes, kept his dog-collar, but not his lead. What was to be done? He was once more in despair, when he saw Water lying on a sofa and playing, in an absent-minded sort of way, with her long strings of coral. He ran up to her as prettily as he could and, after paying her a heap of compliments, begged her to lend him her biggest necklace. She was in a good temper and not only did what he asked, but was kind enough to fasten the end of the coral string to his collar. Tyllo gaily went up to his master, handed him this necklace chain and, kneeling at his feet, said:

“Take me with you like this, my little god! Men never say a word to a poor dog when he is on his chain!”

“Alas, even like this, you cannot come!” said Light, who was much touched by this act of self-sacrifice; and, to cheer him up, she told him that fate would soon provide a trial for the Children in which his assistance would be of great use.

As she spoke these words, she touched the emerald wall, which opened to let her pass through with the Children.

Her chariot was waiting outside the entrance to the temple. It was a lovely shell of jade, inlaid with gold. They all three took their seats; and the two great white birds harnessed to it at once flew off through the clouds. The chariot travelled very fast; and they were not long on the road, much to the regret of the Children, who were enjoying themselves and laughing like anything; but other and even more beautiful surprises awaited them.

The clouds vanished around them; and, suddenly, they found themselves in a dazzling azure palace. Here, all was blue: the light, the flagstones, the columns, the vaults; everything, down to the smallest objects, was of an intense and fairy-like blue. There was no seeing the end of the palace; the eyes were lost in the infinite sapphire vistas.

“How lovely it all is!” said Tyltyl, who could not get over his astonishment. “Goodness me, how lovely!... Where are we?”

“We are in the Kingdom of the Future,” said Light, “in the midst of the children who are not yet born. As the diamond allows us to see clearly in this region which is hidden from men, we shall perhaps find the Blue Bird here.... Look! Look at the children running up!”

From every side came bands of little children dressed from head to foot in blue; they had beautiful dark or golden hair and they were all exquisitely pretty. They shouted gleefully:

“Live Children!... Come and look at the little Live Children!”

“Why do they call us the little Live Children?” asked Tyltyl, of Light.

“It is because they themselves are not alive yet. They are awaiting the hour of their birth, for it is from here that all the children come who are born upon our earth. When the fathers and mothers want children, the great doors which you see over there, at the back, are opened; and the little ones go down....”

“What a lot there are! What a lot there are!” cried Tyltyl.

“There are many more,” said Light. “No one could count them. But go a little further: you will see other things.”

Tyltyl did as he was told and elbowed his way through; but it was difficult for him to move, because a crowd of Blue Children pressed all around them. At last, by mounting on a step, our little friend was able to look over the throng of inquisitive heads and see what was happening in every part of the hall. It was most extraordinary! Tyltyl had never dreamed of anything like it! He danced with joy; and Mytyl, who was hanging on to him and standing on tiptoe so that she might see too, clapped her little hands and gave loud cries of wonder.

All around were millions of Children in blue, some playing, others walking about, others talking or thinking. Many were asleep; many also were at work; and their instruments, their tools, the machines which they were building, the plants, the flowers and the fruits which they were growing or gathering were of the same bright and heavenly blue as the general appearance of the palace. Among the Children moved tall persons also dressed in blue: they were very beautiful and looked just like angels. They came up to Light and smiled and gently pushed aside the Blue Children, who went back quietly to what they were doing, though still watching our friends with astonished eyes.

One of them, however, remained standing close to Tyltyl. He was quite small. From under his long sky-blue silk dress peeped two little pink and dimpled bare feet. His eyes stared in curiosity at the little Live Boy; and he went up to him as though in spite of himself.

“May I talk to him?” asked Tyltyl, who felt half-glad and half-frightened.

“Certainly,” said Light. “You must make friends.... I will leave you alone; you will be more at ease by yourselves....”

So saying, she went away and left the two Children face to face, shyly smiling. Suddenly, they began to talk:

“How do you do?” said Tyltyl, putting out his hand to the Child.

But the Child did not understand what that meant and stood without moving.

“What’s that?” continued Tyltyl, touching the Child’s blue dress.

The Child, who was absorbed in what he was looking at, did not answer, but gravely touched Tyltyl’s hat with his finger:

“And that?” he lisped.

“That?... That’s my hat,” said Tyltyl. “Have you no hat?”

“No; what is it for?” asked the Child.

“It’s to say How-do-you-do with,” Tyltyl answered. “And then for when it’s cold....”

“What does that mean, when it’s cold?” asked the Child.

“When you shiver like this: Brrr! Brrr!” said Tyltyl. “And when you go like this with your arms,” vigorously beating his arms across his chest.

“Is it cold on earth?” asked the Child.

“Yes, sometimes, in winter, when there is no fire.”

“Why is there no fire?...”

“Because it’s expensive; and it costs money to buy wood....”

The Child looked at Tyltyl again as though he did not understand a word that Tyltyl was saying; and Tyltyl in his turn looked amazed:

“It’s quite clear that he knows nothing of the most everyday things,” thought our hero, while the child stared with no small respect at “the little Live Boy” who knew everything.

Then he asked Tyltyl what money was.

“Why, it’s what you pay with!” said Tyltyl, scorning to give any further explanation.

“Oh!” said the Child, seriously.

Of course, he did not understand. How could he know, a little boy like that, who lived in a paradise where his least wishes were granted before he had learnt to put them into words?

“How old are you?” asked Tyltyl, continuing the conversation.

“I am going to be born soon,” said the Child. “I shall be born in twelve years.... Is it nice to be born?”

“Oh, yes,” cried Tyltyl, without thinking. “It’s great fun!”

But he was very much at a loss when the little boy asked him “how he managed.” His pride did not allow him to be ignorant of anything in another child’s presence; and it was quite droll to see him with his hands in his breeches-pockets, his legs wide apart, his face upturned and his whole attitude that of a man who is in no hurry to reply. At last, he answered, with a shrug of the shoulders:

“Upon my word, I can’t remember! It’s so long ago!”

“They say it’s lovely, the earth and the Live People!” remarked the Child.

“Yes, it’s not bad,” said Tyltyl. “There are birds and cakes and toys.... Some have them all; but those who have none can look at the others!”

This reflection shows us the whole character of our little friend. He was proud and inclined to be rather high-and-mighty; but he was never envious and his generous nature made up to him for his poverty by allowing him to enjoy the good fortune of others.

The two Children talked a good deal more; but it would take too long to tell you all they said, because what they said was sometimes only interesting to themselves. After a while, Light, who was watching them from a distance, hurried up to them a little anxiously: Tyltyl was crying! Big tears came rolling down his cheeks and falling on his smart coat. She understood that he was talking of his grandmother and that he could not keep back his tears at the thought of the love which he had lost. He was turning away his head, to hide his feelings; but the inquisitive Child kept asking him questions:

“Do the grannies die?... What does that mean, dying?”

“They go away one evening and do not come back.”

“Has yours gone?”

“Yes,” said Tyltyl. “She was very kind to me.”

And, at these words, the poor little fellow began to cry again.

The Blue Child had never seen any one cry. He lived in a world where grief did not exist. His surprise was great; and he exclaimed:

“What’s the matter with your eyes?... Are they making pearls?”

To him those tears were wonderful things.

“No, it’s not pearls,” said Tyltyl, sheepishly.

“What is it then?”

But our poor friend would not admit what he looked upon as a weakness. He rubbed his eyes awkwardly and put everything down to the dazzling blue of the palace.

The puzzled Child insisted:

“What’s that falling down?”

“Nothing; it’s a little water,” said Tyltyl, impatiently, hoping to cut short the explanation.

But that was out of the question. The Child was very obstinate, touched Tyltyl’s cheeks with his finger and asked, in a tone of curiosity:

“Does it come from the eyes?...”

“Yes, sometimes, when one cries.”

“What does that mean, crying?” asked the Child.

“I have not been crying,” said Tyltyl proudly. “It’s the fault of that blue!... But, if I had cried, it would be the same thing....”

“Do you often cry on earth?...”

“Not little boys, but little girls do.... Don’t you cry here?”

“No, I don’t know how....”

“Well, you will learn....”

At that moment, a great breath of wind made him turn his head and he saw, at a few steps away from him, a large piece of machinery which he had not noticed at first, as he was taken up with his interest in the little Child. It was a grand and magnificent thing, but I cannot tell you its name, because the inventions of the Kingdom of the Future will not be christened by Man until they reach the earth. I can only say that Tyltyl, when he looked at it, thought that the enormous azure wings that whizzed so swiftly before his eyes were like the windmills in his part of the world and that, if he ever found the Blue Bird, its wings would certainly be no more delicate, dainty or dazzling. Full of admiration, he asked his new acquaintance what they were.

“Those?” said the Child. “That’s for the invention which I shall make on earth.”

And, seeing Tyltyl stare with wide-open eyes, he added:

“When I am on earth, I shall have to invent the thing that gives happiness.... Would you like to see it?... It is over there, between those two columns....”

Tyltyl turned round to look; but all the Children at once rushed at him, shouting:

“No, no, come and see mine!...”

“No, mine is much finer!...”

“Mine is a wonderful invention!...”

“Mine is made of sugar!...”

“His is no good!...”

“I’m bringing a light which nobody knows of!...”

And, so saying, the last Child lit himself up entirely with a most extraordinary flame.

Amid these joyous exclamations, the Live Children were dragged towards the blue workshops, where each of the little inventors set his machine going. It was a great blue whirl of disks and pulleys and straps and fly-wheels and driving-wheels and cog-wheels and all kinds of wheels, which sent every sort of machine skimming over the ground or shooting up to the ceiling. Other Blue Children unfolded maps and plans, or opened great big books, or uncovered azure statues, or brought enormous flowers and gigantic fruits that seemed made of sapphires and turquoises.

Our little friends stood with their mouths wide open and their hands clasped together: they thought themselves in paradise. Mytyl bent over to look at a huge flower and laughed into its cup, which covered up her head like a hood of blue silk. A pretty Child, with dark hair and thoughtful eyes, held it by the stalk and said, proudly:

“The flowers will all grow like that, when I am on earth!”

“When will that be?” asked Tyltyl.

“In fifty-three years, four months and nine days.”

Next came two Blue Children bending under the weight of a pole from which was slung a bunch of grapes each larger than a pear.

“A bunch of pears!” cried Tyltyl.

“No, they are grapes,” said the Child. “They will all be like that when I am thirty: I have found the way....”

Tyltyl would have loved to taste them, but another Child came along almost hidden under a basket which one of the tall persons was helping him to carry. His fair-haired, rosy face smiled through the leaves that hung over the wicker-work.

“Look!” he said. “Look at my apples....”

“But those are melons!” said Tyltyl.

“No, no!” said the Child. “They are my apples! They will all be alike when I am alive! I have discovered the process!...”

I should never finish if I were to try and describe to my little readers all the wonderful and incredible things that appeared before our hero’s eyes. But, suddenly, a loud burst of laughter rang through the hall. A Child had spoken of the King of the Nine Planets; and Tyltyl, very much puzzled and perplexed, looked on every side. All the faces, bright with laughter, were turned to some spot which Tyltyl could not see; every finger pointed in the same direction; but our friend looked in vain. They had spoken of a king! He was looking for a throne with a tall, dignified personage on it, wielding a golden sceptre.

“Over there ... over there ... lower down ... behind you!” said a thousand little voices together.

“But where is the King?” Tyltyl and Mytyl repeated, greatly interested.

Then, suddenly, a louder and more serious voice sounded above the silvery murmur of the others:

“Here I am!” it said proudly.

And, at the same time, Tyltyl discovered a chubby baby which he had not yet remarked, for it was the smallest and had kept out of the way till then, sitting at the foot of a column in an attitude of indifference, seemingly rapt in contemplation. The little King was the only one who had taken no notice of the “Live Children.” His beautiful, liquid eyes, eyes as blue as the palace, were pursuing endless dreams; his right hand supported his head, which was already heavy with thought; his short tunic showed his dimpled knees; and a golden crown rested on his yellow locks. When he cried, “Here I am!” the baby rose from the step on which he was sitting and tried to climb on to it at one stride; but he was still so awkward that he lost his balance and fell upon his nose. He at once picked himself up with so much dignity that nobody dared make fun of him; and, this time, he scrambled up on all fours and then, putting his legs wide apart, stood and eyed Tyltyl from top to toe.

“You’re not very big!” said Tyltyl, doing his best to keep from laughing.

“I shall do great things when I am!” retorted the King, in a tone that admitted of no reply.

“And what will you do?” asked Tyltyl.

“I shall found the General Confederation of the Solar Planets,” said the King, in a very pompous voice.

Our friend was so much impressed that he could not find a word to say; and the King continued:

“All the Planets will belong to it, except Uranus, Saturn and Neptune, which are too ridiculously far away.”

Thereupon, he toddled off the step again and resumed his first attitude, showing that he had said all that he meant to say.

Tyltyl left him to his meditations; he was eager to know as many more of the Children as he could. He was introduced to the discoverer of a new sun, to the inventor of a new joy, to the hero who was to wipe out injustice from the earth and to the wiseacre who was to conquer Death.... There were such lots and lots of them that it would take days and days to name them all. Our friend was rather tired and was beginning to feel bored, when his attention was suddenly aroused by hearing a Child’s voice calling him:

“Tyltyl!... Tyltyl!... How are you, Tyltyl, how are you?...”

A little Blue Child came running up from the back of the hall, pushing his way through the crowd. He was fair and slim and bright-eyed and had a great look of Mytyl.

“How do you know my name?” asked Tyltyl.

“It’s not surprising,” said the Blue Child, “considering that I shall be your brother!”

This time, the Live Children were absolutely amazed. What an extraordinary meeting! They must certainly tell Mummy as soon as they got back! How astonished they would be at home!

While they were making these reflections, the Child went on to explain:

“I am coming to you next year, on Palm Sunday,” he said.

And he put a thousand questions to his big brother: was it comfortable at home? Was the food good? Was Daddy very severe? And Mummy?

“Oh, Mummy is so kind!” said the little ones.

And they asked him questions in their turn: what was he going to do on earth? What was he bringing?

“I am bringing three illnesses,” said the little brother. “Scarlatina, whooping cough and measles....”

“Oh, that’s all, is it?” cried Tyltyl.

He shook his head, with evident disappointment, while the other continued:

“After that, I shall leave you!”

“It will hardly be worth while coming!” said Tyltyl, feeling rather vexed.

“We can’t pick and choose!” said the little brother, pettishly.

They would perhaps have quarrelled, without waiting till they were on earth, if they had not suddenly been parted by a swarm of Blue Children who were hurrying to meet somebody. At the same time, there was a great noise, as if thousands of invisible doors were being opened at the end of the galleries.

“What’s the matter?” asked Tyltyl.

“It’s Time,” said one of the Blue Children. “He’s going to open the doors.”

And the excitement increased on every side. The Children left their machines and their labours; those who were asleep woke up; and every eye was eagerly and anxiously turned to the great opal doors at the back, while every mouth repeated the same name. The word, “Time! Time!” was heard all around; and the great mysterious noise kept on. Tyltyl was dying to know what it meant. At last, he caught a little Child by the skirt of his dress and asked him.

“Let me be,” said the Child, very uneasily. “I’m in a hurry: it may be my turn today.... It is the Dawn rising. This is the hour when the Children who are to be born today go down to earth.... You shall see.... Time is drawing the bolts....”

“Who is Time?” asked Tyltyl.

“An old man who comes to call those who are going,” said another Child. “He is not so bad; but he won’t listen or hear. Beg as they may, if it’s not their turn, he pushes back all those who try to go.... Let me be! It may be my turn now!”

Light now hastened towards our little friends in a great state of alarm:

“I was looking for you,” she said. “Come quick: it will never do for Time to discover you.”

As she spoke these words, she threw her gold cloak around the Children and dragged them to a corner of the hall, where they could see everything, without being seen.

Tyltyl was very glad to be so well protected. He now knew that he who was about to appear possessed so great and tremendous a power that no human strength was capable of resisting him. He was at the same time a deity and an ogre; he bestowed life and he devoured it; he sped through the world so fast that you had no time to see him; he ate and ate, without stopping; he took whatever he touched. In Tyltyl’s family, he had already taken Grandad and Granny, the little brothers, the little sisters and the old blackbird! He did not mind what he took: joys and sorrows, winters and summers, all was fish that came to his net!...

Knowing this, our friend was astonished to see everybody in the Kingdom of the Future running so fast to meet him.

“I suppose he doesn’t eat anything here,” he thought.

There he was! The great doors turned slowly on their hinges. There was a distant music: it was the sounds of the earth. A red and green light penetrated into the hall; and Time appeared on the threshold. He was a tall and very thin old man, so old that his wrinkled face was all grey, like dust. His white beard came down to his knees. In one hand, he carried an enormous scythe; in the other, an hour-glass. Behind him, some way out, on a sea the colour of the Dawn, was a magnificent gold galley, with white sails.

“Are they ready whose hour has struck?” asked Time. At the sound of that voice, solemn and deep as a bronze gong, thousands of bright children’s voices, like little silver bells, answered:

“Here we are!... Here we are!... Here we are!...”

And, in a moment, the Blue Children were crowding round the tall old man, who pushed them all back and, in a gruff voice, said:

“One at a time!... Once again, there are many more of you than are wanted!... You can’t deceive me!”

Brandishing his scythe in one hand and holding out his cloak with the other, he barred the way to the rash Children who tried to slip by him. Not one of them escaped the horrid old man’s watchful eye:

“It’s not your turn!” he said to one. “You’re to be born to-morrow!... Nor yours either, you’ve got ten years to wait.... A thirteenth shepherd?... There are only twelve wanted; there is no need for more.... More doctors?... There are too many already; they are grumbling about it on earth.... And where are the engineers?... They want an honest man; only one, as a wonderful being.”

Thereupon, a poor Child, who had hung back, until then, came forward timidly, sucking his thumb. He looked pale and sad and walked with tottering footsteps; he was so wretched that even Time felt a moment’s pity:

“It’s you!” he exclaimed. “You seem a very poor specimen!”

And, lifting his eyes to the sky, with a look of discouragement, he added:

“You won’t live long!”

And the movement went on. Each Child, when denied, returned to his employment with a downcast air. When one of them was accepted, the others looked at him with envy. Now and then, something happened, as when the hero who was to fight against injustice refused to go. He clung to his playfellows, who called out to Time:

“He doesn’t want to, Sir!”

“No, I don’t want to go,” cried the little fellow, with all his might. “I would rather not be born.”

“And quite right too!” thought Tyltyl, who was full of common-sense and who knew what things are like on earth.

For people always get beatings which they have not deserved; and, when they have done wrong, you may be sure that the punishment will fall on one of their innocent friends.

“I wouldn’t care to be in his place,” said our friend to himself. “I would rather hunt for the Blue Bird, any day!”

Meanwhile, the little seeker after justice went away sobbing, frightened out of his life by Mr. Time.

The excitement was now at its height. The Children ran all over the hall: those who were going packed up their inventions; those who were staying behind had a thousand requests to make:

“Will you write to me?”

“They say one can’t!”

“Oh, try, do try!”

“Announce my idea!”

“Good-bye, Jean.... Good-bye, Pierre!”

“Have you forgotten anything?”

“Don’t lose your ideas!”

“Try to tell us if it’s nice!”

“Enough! Enough!” roared Time, in a huge voice, shaking his big keys and his terrible scythe, “Enough! The anchor’s weighed....”

Then the Children climbed into the gold galley, with the beautiful white silk sails. They waved their hands again to the little friends whom they were leaving behind them; but, on seeing the earth in the distance, they cried out, gladly:

“Earth! Earth!... I can see it!...”

“How bright it is!...”

“How big it is!...”

And, at the same time, as though coming from the abyss, a song rose, a distant song of gladness and expectation.

Light, who was listening with a smile, saw the look of astonishment on Tyltyl’s face and bent over him:

“It is the song of the mothers coming out to meet them,” she said.

At that moment, Time, who had shut the doors, saw our friends and rushed at them angrily, shaking his scythe at them.

“Hurry!” said Light. “Hurry! Take the Blue Bird, Tyltyl, and go in front of me with Mytyl.”

She put into the boy’s arms a bird which she held hidden under her cloak and, all radiant, spreading her dazzling veil with her two hands, she ran on, protecting her charges from the onslaught of Time.

In this way, they passed through several turquoise and sapphire galleries. It was magnificently beautiful, but they were in the Kingdom of the Future, where Time was the great master, and they must escape from his anger which they had braved.

Mytyl was terribly frightened and Tyltyl kept nervously turning round to Light.

“Don’t be afraid,” she said. “I am the only person whom Time has respected since the world began. Only mind that you take care of the Blue Bird. He’s gorgeous! He is quite, quite blue!”

This thought enraptured the boy. He felt the precious treasure fluttering in his arms; his hands dared not press the pretty creature’s soft, warm wings; and his heart beat against its heart. This time, he held the Blue Bird! Nothing could touch it, because it was given to him by Light herself. What a triumph when he returned home!...

He was so bewildered by his happiness that he hardly knew where he was going; his joy rang a victorious peal in his head that made him feel giddy; he was mad with pride; and this, worse luck, made him lose his coolness and his presence of mind! They were just about to cross the threshold of the palace, when a gust of wind swept through the entrance-hall, lifting up Light’s veil and at last revealing the two Children to the eyes of Time, who was still pursuing them. With a roar of rage, he darted his scythe at Tyltyl, who cried out. Light warded off the blow; and the door of the palace closed behind them with a thud. They were saved!... But alas, Tyltyl, taken by surprise, had opened his arms and now, through his tears, saw the Bird of the Future soaring above their heads, mingling with the azure sky its dream-wings so blue, so light and so transparent that soon the boy could make out nothing more....





Chapter 6　IN THE TEMPLE OF LIGHT


TYLTYL had enjoyed himself thoroughly in the Kingdom of the Future. He had seen many wonderful things and thousands of little playfellows and then, without taking the least pains or trouble, had found the Blue Bird in his arms in the most magical way. He had never pictured anything more beautiful, more blue or brilliant; and he still felt it fluttering against his heart and kept hugging his arms to his breast as though the Blue Bird were there.

Alas, it had vanished like a dream!

He was thinking sadly of this latest disappointment as he walked hand-in-hand with Light. They were back in the Temple and were going to the vaults where the Animals and Things had been shut up. What a sight met their eyes! The wretches had eaten and drunk such a lot that they were lying on the floor quite tipsy! Tyllo himself had lost all his dignity. He had rolled under the table and was snoring like a porpoise. His instinct remained; and the sound of the door made him prick up his ears. He opened one eye, but his sight was troubled by all that he had had to drink and he did not know his little master when he saw him. He dragged himself to his feet with a great effort, turned round several times and then dropped on the floor again with a grunt of satisfaction.

Bread and the others were as bad; and the only exception was the Cat, who was sitting up prettily on a marble and gold bench and seemed in full possession of her senses. She sprang nimbly to the ground and stepped up to Tyltyl with a smile:

“I have been longing to see you,” she said, “for I have been very unhappy among all these vulgar people. They first drank all the wine and then started shouting and singing and dancing, quarrelling and fighting and making such a noise that I was very glad when, at last, they fell into a tipsy sleep.”

The children praised her warmly for her good behaviour. As a matter of fact, there was no great merit in this, for she could not stand anything stronger than milk; but we are seldom rewarded when by rights we ought to be and sometimes are when we have not deserved it.

After fondly kissing the children, Tylette asked a favour of Light:

“I have had such a wretched time,” she whined. “Let me go out for a little while; it will do me good to be alone.”

Light gave her consent without suspecting anything; and the Cat at once draped her cloak round her, put her hat straight, pulled up her soft grey boots over her knees, opened the door and ran and bounded out into the forest. We shall know, a little later, where treacherous Tylette was going so gaily and what was the horrid plot which she was mysteriously concocting.

As on the other days, the Children had their dinner with Light in a large room all encrusted with diamonds. The servants bustled around them smiling and brought delicious dishes and cakes.

After dinner, our little friends began to yawn. They felt sleepy very early, after all their adventures; and, Light— ever kind and thoughtful— made them live as they were accustomed to on earth. So as not to injure their health by altering their habits, she had set up their little beds in a part of the temple where the darkness would seem like night to them.

They went through any number of rooms to reach their bedroom. They had first to pass all the lights known to Man and then those which Man did not yet know.

There were great sumptuous apartments in splendid marble, lit up by rays so white and strong that the children were quite dazzled.

“That is the Light of the Rich,” said Light to Tyltyl. “You see how dangerous it is. People run the risk of going blind when they live too much in its rays, which leave no room for soft and kindly shade.”

And she hurried them on so that they might rest their eyes in the gentle Light of the Poor. Here, the Children suddenly felt as if they were in their parents’ cottage, where everything was so humble and peaceful. The faint light was very pure and clear, but always flickering and ready to go out at the least breath.

Next they came to the beautiful Light of the Poets, which they liked immensely, for it had all the colours of the rainbow; and, when you passed through it, you saw lovely pictures, lovely flowers and lovely toys which you were unable to take hold of. Laughing merrily, the children ran after birds and butterflies, but everything faded away as soon as it was touched.

“Well, I never!” said Tyltyl, as he came panting back to Light. “This beats everything! I can’t understand it!”

“You will understand later,” she replied, “and, if you understand it properly, you will be among the very few human beings who know the Blue Bird when they see him.”

After leaving the region of the Poets, our friends reached the Light of the Learnt, which lies on the borders of the known and the unknown lights. “Let’s get on,” said Tyltyl. “This is boring.”

To tell the truth, he was a little bit frightened, for they were in a long row of cold and forbidding arches, which were streaked at every moment by dazzling lightning-flashes; and, at each flash, you saw out-of-the-way things that had no name as yet.

After these arches, they came to the Lights Unknown to Man; and Tyltyl, in spite of the sleep that pressed upon his eyelids, could not help admiring the hall with its violet columns and the gallery with its red rays. And the violet of the columns was such a dark violet and the red of the rays such a pale red that it was hardly possible to see either of them.

At last, they arrived at the room of smooth, unflecked Black Light, which men call Darkness because their eyes are not yet able to make it out. And here the Children fell asleep without delay on two soft beds of clouds.





Chapter 7　THE GRAVEYARD


WHEN the Children were not going on an expedition, they played about in the Realms of Light; and this was a great treat for them, for the gardens and the country around the temple were as wonderful as the halls and galleries of silver and gold.

The leaves of some of the plants were so broad and strong that they were able to lie down on them; and, when a breath of wind stirred the leaves, the Children swung as in a hammock. It was always summer there and never a moment was darkened by the night; but the hours were known by their different colours; there were pink, white, blue, lilac, green and yellow hours; and, according to their hues, the flowers, the fruits, the birds, the butterflies and the scents changed, causing Tyltyl and Mytyl a constant surprise. They had all the toys that they could wish for. When they were tired of playing, they stretched themselves out on the backs of the lizards, which were as long and wide as little boats, and quickly, quickly raced round the garden-paths, over the sand which was as white and as good to eat as sugar. When they were thirsty, Water shook her tresses into the cup of the enormous flowers; and the Children drank straight out of the lilies, tulips and morning-glories. If they were hungry, they picked radiant fruits which revealed the taste of Light to them and which had juice that shone like the rays of the sun.

There was also, in a clump of bushes, a white marble pond which possessed a magic power: its clear waters reflected not the faces, but the souls of those who looked into it.

“It’s a ridiculous invention,” said the Cat, who steadily refused to go near the pond.

You, my dear little readers, who know her thoughts as well as I do, will not be surprised at her refusal. And you will also understand why our faithful Tyllo was not afraid to go and quench his thirst there: he need not fear to reveal his thoughts, for he was the only creature whose soul never altered. The dear Dog had no feelings but those of love and kindness and devotion.

When Tyltyl bent over the magic mirror, he almost always saw the picture of a splendid Blue Bird, for the constant wish to find him filled his mind entirely. Then he would run to Light and entreat her:

“Tell me where he is!... You know everything: tell me where to find him!”

But she replied, in a tone of mystery:

“I cannot tell you anything. You must find him for yourself.” And, kissing him, she added, “Cheer up; you are getting nearer to him at each trial.”

Now there came a day on which she said to him:

“I have received a message from the Fairy Berylune telling me that the Blue Bird is probably hidden in the graveyard.... It appears that one of the Dead in the graveyard is keeping him in his tomb....”

“What shall we do?” asked Tyltyl.

“It is very simple: at midnight you will turn the diamond and you shall see the Dead come out of the ground.”

At these words, Milk, Water, Bread and Sugar began to yell and scream and chatter their teeth.

“Don’t mind them,” said Light to Tyltyl, in a whisper. “They are afraid of the Dead.”

“I’m not afraid of them!” said Fire, frisking about. “Time was when I used to burn them; that was much more amusing than nowadays.”

“Oh, I feel I am going to turn,” wailed Milk.

“I’m not afraid,” said the Dog, trembling in every limb, ”but if you run away.... I shall run away too ... and with the greatest pleasure....”

The Cat sat pulling at her whiskers:

“I know what’s what,” she said, in her usual mysterious way.

“Be quiet,” said Light. “The Fairy gave strict orders. You are all to stay with me, at the gate of the graveyard; the Children are to go in alone.”

Tyltyl felt anything but pleased. He asked:

“Aren’t you coming with us?”

“No,” said Light. “The time for that has not arrived. Light cannot yet enter among the Dead. Besides, there is nothing to fear. I shall not be far away; and those who love me and whom I love always find me again....”

She had not finished speaking, when everything around the Children changed. The wonderful temple, the dazzling flowers, the splendid gardens vanished to make way for a poor little country cemetery, which lay in the soft moonlight. Near the Children were a number of graves, grassy mounds, wooden crosses and tombstones. Tyltyl and Mytyl were seized with terror and hugged each other:

“I am frightened!” said Mytyl.

“I am never frightened,” stammered Tyltyl, who was shaking with fear, but did not like to say so.

“I say,” asked Mytyl, “are the Dead wicked?”

“Why, no,” said Tyltyl, “they’re not alive!...”

“Have you ever seen one?”

“Yes, once, long ago, when I was very young....”

“What was it like?”

“Quite white, very still and very cold; and it didn’t talk....”

“Are we going to see them?”

Tyltyl shuddered at this question and made an unsuccessful effort to steady his voice as he answered:

“Why, of course, Light said so!”

“Where are the Dead?” asked Mytyl.

Tyltyl cast a frightened look around him, for the Children had not dared to stir since they were alone:

“The Dead are here,” he said, “under the grass or under those big stones.”

“Are those the doors of their houses?” asked Mytyl, pointing to the tombstones.

“Yes.”

“Do they go out when it’s fine?”

“They can only go out at night.”

“Why?”

“Because they are in their nightshirts.”

“Do they go out also when it rains?”

“When it rains, they stay at home.”

“Is it nice in their homes?”

“They say it’s very cramped.”

“Have they any little children?”

“Why, yes, they have all those who die.”

“And what do they live on?”

Tyltyl stopped to think, before answering. As Mytyl’s big brother, he felt it his duty to know everything; but her questions often puzzled him. Then he reflected that, as the Dead live under ground, they can hardly eat anything that is above it; and so he answered very positively:

“They eat roots!”

Mytyl was quite satisfied and returned to the great question that was occupying her little mind:

“Shall we see them?” she asked.

“Of course,” said Tyltyl, “we see everything when I turn the diamond.”

“And what will they say?”

Tyltyl began to grow impatient:

“They will say nothing, as they don’t talk.”

“Why don’t they talk?” asked Mytyl.

“Because they have nothing to say,” said Tyltyl, more cross and perplexed than ever.

“Why have they nothing to say?”

This time, the little big brother lost all patience. He shrugged his shoulders, gave Mytyl a push and shouted angrily:

“You’re a nuisance!...”

Mytyl was greatly upset and confused. She sucked her thumb and resolved to hold her tongue for ever after, as she had been so badly treated! But a breath of wind made the leaves of the trees whisper and suddenly recalled the Children to their fears and their sense of loneliness. They hugged each other tight and began to talk again, so as not to hear the horrible silence:

“When will you turn the diamond?” asked Mytyl.

“You heard Light say that I was to wait until midnight, because that disturbs them less; it is when they come out to take the air....”

“Isn’t it midnight yet?” Tyltyl turned round, saw the church clock and hardly had the strength to answer, for the hands were just upon the hour:

“Listen,” he stammered, “listen.... It is just going to strike.... There!... Do you hear?...”

And the clock struck twelve.

Then Mytyl, frightened out of her life, began to stamp her feet and utter piercing screams:

“I want to go away!... I want to go away!...”

Tyltyl, though stiff with fright, was able to say:

“Not now.... I am going to turn the diamond....”

“No, no, no!” cried Mytyl. “I am so frightened, little brother!... Don’t do it!... I want to go away!...”

Tyltyl vainly tried to lift his hand: he could not reach the diamond with Mytyl clinging to him, hanging with all her weight on her brother’s arm and screaming at the top of her voice:

“I don’t want to see the Dead!... They will be awful!... I can’t possibly!... I am much too frightened!...”

Poor Tyltyl was quite as much terrified as Mytyl, but at each trial, his will and courage were becoming greater; he was learning to master himself; and nothing could induce him to fail in his mission. The eleventh stroke rang out.

“The hour is passing!” he exclaimed. “It is time!”

And releasing himself resolutely from Mytyl’s arms, he turned the diamond....

A moment of terrible silence followed for the poor little children. Then they saw the crosses totter, the mounds open, the slabs rise up....

Mytyl hid her face against Tyltyl’s chest:

“They’re coming out!” she cried. “They’re there!... They’re there!...”

The agony was more than the plucky little fellow could endure. He shut his eyes and only kept himself from fainting by leaning against a tree beside him. He remained like that for a minute that seemed to him like a century, not daring to move, not daring to breathe. Then he heard birds singing; a warm and scented breeze fanned his face; and, on his hands, on his neck, he felt the soft heat of the balmy summer sun. Now quite reassured, but unable to believe in so great a miracle, he opened his eyes and at once began to shout with happiness and admiration.

From all the open tombs came thousands of splendid flowers. They spread everywhere, on the paths, on the trees, on the grass; and they went up and up until it seemed that they would touch the sky. They were great full-blown roses, showing their hearts, wonderful golden hearts from which came the hot, bright rays which had wrapped Tyltyl in that summer warmth. Round the roses, birds sang and bees buzzed gaily.

“I can’t believe it! It’s not possible!” said Tyltyl. “What has become of the tombs and the stone crosses?”

Dazzled and bewildered, the two children walked hand in hand through the graveyard, of which not a trace remained, for there was nothing but a wonderful garden on every side. They were as glad and happy as could be, after their terrible fright. They had thought that ugly skeletons would rise from the earth and run after them, pulling horrid faces; they had imagined all sorts of awful things. And now, in the presence of the truth, they saw that all that they had been told was a great big story and that Death does not exist. They saw that there are no Dead and that Life goes on always, always, but under fresh forms. The fading rose sheds its pollen, which gives birth to other roses, and its scattered petals scent the air. The fruits come when the blossoms fall from the trees; and the dingy, hairy caterpillar turns into a brilliant butterfly. Nothing perishes ... there are only changes....

Beautiful birds circled all round Tyltyl and Mytyl. There were no blue ones among them, but the two Children were so glad of their discovery that they asked for nothing more. Astonished and delighted, they kept on repeating:

“There are no Dead!... There are no Dead!...”





Chapter 8　THE FOREST


AS soon as Tyltyl and Mytyl were in bed, Light kissed them and faded away at once, so as not to disturb their sleep with the rays that always streamed from her beautiful self.

It must have been about midnight, when Tyltyl, who was dreaming of the little Blue Children, felt a soft velvet paw pass to and fro over his face. He was surprised and sat up in bed in a bit of a fright; but he was soon reassured when he saw his friend Tylette’s glowing eyes glittering in the dark.

“Hush!” said the Cat in his ear. “Hush! Don’t wake anybody. If we can arrange to slip out without being seen, we shall catch the Blue Bird to-night. I have risked my life, O my dearest master, in preparing a plan which will certainly lead us to victory!”

“But,” said the boy, kissing Tylette, “Light would be so glad to help us ... and besides I should be ashamed to disobey her....”

“If you tell her,” said the Cat, sharply, “all is lost, believe me. Do as I say; and the day is ours.”

As she spoke these words, she hastened to dress him and also Mytyl, who had heard a noise and was asking to go with them.

“You don’t understand,” groaned Tyltyl. “You are too small: you don’t know what a wicked thing we are doing....”

But the treacherous Cat answered all his arguments, saying that the reason why he had not found the Blue Bird so far was just the fault of Light, who always brought brightness with her. Let the Children only go hunting by themselves, in the dark, and they would soon find all the Blue Birds that make men’s happiness. The traitress displayed such cleverness that, before long, Tyltyl’s disobedience became a very fine thing in his own eyes. Each of Tylette’s words provided a good excuse for his action or adorned it with a generous thought. He was too weak to set his will against trickery, allowed himself to be persuaded and walked out of the temple with a firm and cheerful step. Poor little fellow: if he could only have foreseen the terrible trap that awaited him!

Our three companions set out across the fields in the white light of the moon. The Cat seemed greatly excited, did nothing but talk and went so fast that the children were hardly able to keep up with her:

“This time,” she declared, “we shall have the Blue Bird, I am sure of it! I asked all the Trees in the very oldest forest; they know him, because he hides among them. Then, in order to have everybody there, I sent the Rabbit to beat the assembly and call the principal Animals in the country.”

They reached the edge of the dark forest in an hour’s time. Then, at a turn in the road, they saw, in the distance, some one who seemed to be hurrying towards them. Tylette arched her back: she felt that it was her old time enemy. She quivered with rage: was he once more going to thwart her plans? Had he guessed her secret? Was he coming, at the last moment, to save the Children’s lives?

She leaned over to Tyltyl and whispered to him, in her most honeyed voice:

“I am sorry to say it is our worthy friend the Dog. It is a thousand pities, because his presence will make us fail in our object. He is on the worst of terms with everybody, even the Trees. Do tell him to go back!”

“Go away, you ugly thing!” said Tyltyl, shaking his fist at the Dog.

Dear old faithful Tyllo, who had come because he suspected the Cat’s plans, was much hurt by these hard words. He was ready to cry, was still out of breath from running and could think of nothing to say.

“Go away, I tell you!” said Tyltyl again. “We don’t want you here and there’s an end of it.... You’re a nuisance, there!...”

The Dog was an obedient animal and, at any other time, he would have gone; but his affection told him what a serious business it was and he stood stock still.

“Do you allow this disobedience?” said the Cat to Tyltyl, in a whisper. “Hit him with your stick.”

Tyltyl beat the Dog, as the Cat suggested:

“There, that will teach you to be more obedient!” he said.

The poor Dog howled at receiving the blows; but there was no limit to his self-sacrifice. He went up to his young master pluckily and, taking him in his arms, cried:

“I must kiss you now you’ve beaten me!”

Tyltyl, who was a good-hearted little fellow, did not know what to do; and the Cat swore between her teeth like a wild beast. Fortunately, dear little Mytyl interfered on our friend’s behalf:

“No, no; I want him to stay,” she pleaded. “I’m frightened when Tyllo’s not with us.”

Time was short and they had to come to a decision.

“I’ll find some other way to get rid of the idiot!” thought the Cat. And, turning to the Dog, she said, in her most gracious manner, “We shall be so pleased if you will join us!”

As they entered the great forest, the Children stuck close together, with the Cat and the Dog on either side of them. They were awed by the silence and the darkness and they felt much relieved when the Cat exclaimed:

“Here we are! Turn the diamond!”

Then the light spread around them and showed them a wonderful sight. They were standing in the middle of a large round space in the heart of the forest, where all the old, old Trees seemed to reach up to the sky. Wide avenues formed a white star amidst the dark green of the wood. Everything was peaceful and still; but suddenly a strange shiver ran through the foliage; the branches moved and stretched like human arms; the roots raised the earth that covered them, came together, took the shapes of legs and feet and stood on the ground; a tremendous crash rang through the air; the trunks of the Trees burst open and each of them let out its soul, which made its appearance like a funny human figure.

Some stepped slowly from their trunks; others came out with a jump; and all of them gathered inquisitively round our friends.

The talkative Poplar began to chatter like a magpie:

“Little Men! We shall be able to talk to them! We have done with silence!... Where do they come from?... Who are they?”

And so he rattled on.

The Lime-tree, who was a jolly, fat fellow, came up calmly, smoking his pipe; the conceited and dandified Chestnut-tree screwed his glass into his eye to stare at the Children. He wore a coat of green silk embroidered with pink and white flowers. He thought the little ones too poor-looking and turned away in derision.

“He thinks he’s everybody, since he has taken to living in town! He despises us!” sneered the Poplar, who was jealous of him.

“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” wept the Willow, a wretched little stunted fellow, who came clattering along in a pair of wooden shoes too big for him. “They have come to cut off my head and arms for firewood!”

Tyltyl could not believe his eyes. He never stopped asking the Cat questions:

“Who’s this?... Who’s that?...”

And Tylette introduced the soul of each Tree to him.

There was the Elm, who was a sort of short-winded, paunchy, crabby gnome; the Beech, an elegant, sprightly person; the Birch, who looked like the ghosts in the Palace of Night, with his white flowing garments and his restless gestures. The tallest figure was the Fir-tree: Tyltyl found it very difficult to see his face perched right at the top of his long, thin body; but he looked gentle and sad, whereas the Cypress, who stood near him, dressed all in black, frightened Tyltyl terribly.

However, so far nothing very dreadful had happened. The Trees, delighted at being able to talk, were all chattering together; and our young friend was simply going to ask them where the Blue Bird was hidden, when, all of a sudden, silence reigned. The Trees bowed respectfully and stood aside to make way for an immensely old Tree, dressed in a long gown embroidered with moss and lichen. He leaned with one hand on a stick and with the other on a young Oak Sapling who acted as his guide, for the Old Oak was blind. His long white beard streamed in the wind.

“It’s the King!” said Tyltyl to himself, when he saw his mistletoe crown. “I will ask him the secret of the forest.”

And he was just going up to him, when he stopped, seized with surprise and joy: there sat the Blue Bird before him, perched on the old Oak’s shoulder.

“He has the Blue Bird!” cried the boy, gleefully. “Quick! Quick! Give him to me!”

“Silence! Hold your tongue!” said the greatly shocked Trees.

“Take off your hat, Tyltyl,” said the Cat. “It’s the Oak!”

The poor Child at once obeyed with a smile; he did not understand the danger that threatened him and he did not hesitate to answer, “Yes, Sir,” when the Oak asked him if he was Tyl the woodcutter’s son.

Then the Oak, trembling with rage, began to lay a terrible charge against Daddy Tyl:

“In my family alone,” he said, “your father has put to death six hundred of my sons, four hundred and seventy-five uncles and aunts, twelve hundred cousins of both sexes, three hundred and eighty daughters-in-law and twelve thousand great-grandsons!”

No doubt his anger made him exaggerate a little; but Tyltyl listened without protest and said, very politely:

“I beg your pardon, Sir, for disturbing you.... The Cat said that you would tell us where the Blue Bird is.”

The Oak was too old not to know all there was to know about Men and Animals. He smiled in his beard when he guessed the trap laid by the Cat and he felt very glad at it, for he had long wished to revenge the whole forest for the slavery to which Man had subjected it.

“It’s for the Fairy Berylune’s little girl, who is very ill,” the boy continued.

“Enough!” said the Oak, silencing him. “I do not hear the Animals.... Where are they?... All this concerns them as much as us.... We, the Trees, must not assume the responsibility alone for the grave measures that have become necessary.”

“Here they come!” said the Fir-tree, looking over the top of the other Trees. “They are following the Rabbit.... I can see the souls of the Horse, the Bull, the Ox, the Cow, the Wolf, the Sheep, the Pig, the Goat, and the Bear....”

All the Animals now arrived. They walked on their hind-legs and were dressed like human beings. They solemnly took up their positions in a circle among the Trees, all except the frivolous Goat, who began to skip down the avenues, and the Pig, who hoped to find some glorious truffles among the roots that had newly left the ground.

“Are all here present?” asked the Oak.

“The Hen could not leave her eggs,” said the Rabbit, “the Hare was out for a run, the Stag has pains in his horns and his corns, the Fox is ill—here is the doctor’s certificate—the Goose did not understand and the Turkey flew into a passion....”

“Look!” whispered Tyltyl to Mytyl. “Aren’t they funny? They are just like the rich children’s fine toys in the windows at Christmas-time.”

The Rabbit especially made them laugh, with his cocked hat over his big ears, his blue, embroidered coat and his drum slung in front of him.

Meanwhile, the Oak was explaining the situation to his brothers the Trees and to the Animals. Treacherous Tylette had been quite right in reckoning on their hatred.

“The child you see before you,” said the Oak, “thanks to a talisman stolen from the powers of Earth, is able to take possession of our Blue Bird and thus to snatch from us the secret which we have kept since the origin of life.... Now we know enough of Man to entertain no doubt as to the fate which he reserves for us, once he is in possession of this secret.... Any hesitation would be both foolish and criminal.... It is a serious moment; the child must be done away with before it is too late....”

“What is he saying?” asked Tyltyl, who could not make out what the old Tree was driving at.

The Dog was prowling round the Oak and now showed his fangs:

“Do you see my teeth, you old cripple?” he growled.

“He is insulting the Oak!” said the Beech indignantly.

“Drive him out!” shouted the Oak, angrily. “He’s a traitor!”

“What did I tell you?” whispered the Cat to Tyltyl. “I will arrange things…. But send him away.”

“Will you be off!” said Tyltyl to the Dog.

“Do let me worry the gouty old beggar’s moss slippers!” begged Tyllo.

Tyltyl tried in vain to prevent him. The rage of Tyllo, who understood the danger, knew no bounds; and he would have succeeded in saving his master, if the Cat had not thought of calling in the Ivy, who till then had kept his distance. The Dog pranced about like a madman, abusing everybody. He railed at the Ivy:

“Come on, if you dare, you old ball of twine, you!”

The onlookers growled; the Oak was pale with fury at seeing his authority denied; the Trees and the Animals were indignant, but, as they were cowards, not one of them dared protest; and the Dog would have settled all of them, if he had gone on with his rebellion. But Tyltyl threatened him harshly; and, suddenly yielding to his docile instincts, Tyllo lay down at his master’s feet. Thus it is that our finest virtues are treated as faults, when we exercise them without discrimination.

From that moment, the Children were lost. The Ivy gagged and bound the poor Dog, who was then taken behind the Chestnut-tree and tied to his biggest root.

“Now,” cried the Oak, in a voice of thunder, “we can take counsel quietly.... This is the first time that it is given us to judge Man! I do not think that, after the monstrous injustice which we have suffered, there can remain the least doubt as to the sentence that awaits him....”

One cry rang from every throat:

“Death! Death! Death!”

The poor Children did not at first understand their doom, for the Trees and Animals, who were more accustomed to talking their own special language, did not speak very distinctly; and, besides, the innocent Children could never imagine such cruelty!

“What is the matter with them?” asked the boy. “Are they displeased?”

“Don’t be alarmed,” said the Cat. “They are a little annoyed because Spring is late....”

And she went on talking into Tyltyl’s ear, to divert his attention from what was happening.

While the trusting lad was listening to her fibs, the others were discussing which form of execution would be the most practical and the least dangerous. The Bull suggested a good butt with the horns; the Beech offered his highest branch to hang the little Children on; and the Ivy was already preparing a slip-knot! The Fir-tree was willing to give the four planks for the coffin and the Cypress the perpetual grant of a tomb.

“By far the simplest way,” whispered the Willow, “would be to drown them in one of my rivers.”

And the Pig grunted between his teeth:

“In my opinion, the great thing would be to eat the little girl.... She ought to be very tender....”

“Silence!” roared the Oak. “What we have to decide is which of us shall have the honour of striking the first blow!”

“That honour falls to you, our King!” said the Fir-tree.

“Alas, I am too old!” replied the Oak. “I am blind and infirm! To you, my evergreen brother, be the glory, in my place, of striking the decisive blow that shall set us free.”

But the Fir-tree declined the honour on the pretext that he was already to have the pleasure of burying the two victims and that he was afraid of rousing jealousy. He suggested the Beech, as owning the best club.

“It is out of the question,” said the Beech. “You know I am worm-eaten! Ask the Elm and the Cypress.”

Thereupon the Elm began to moan and groan: a mole had twisted his great toe the night before and he could hardly stand upright; and the Cypress excused himself and so did the Poplar, who declared that he was ill and shivering with fever. Then the Oak’s indignation flared up:

“You are afraid of Man!” he exclaimed. “Even those unprotected and unarmed little Children inspire you with terror!... Well, I shall go forth alone, old and shaky and blind as I am, against the hereditary enemy!... Where is he?...”

And groping his way with his stick, he moved towards Tyltyl, growling as he went.

Our poor little friend had been very much afraid during the last few minutes. The Cat had left him suddenly, saying that she wanted to smooth down the excitement, and had not come back. Mytyl nestled trembling against him; and he felt very lonely, very unhappy among those dreadful people whose anger he was beginning to notice. When he saw the Oak marching on him with a threatening air, he drew his pocket-knife and defied him like a man:

“Is it I he’s after, that old one, with his big stick?” he cried.

But, at the sight of the knife, Man’s irresistible weapon, all the Trees shook with fright and rushed at the Oak to hold him back. There was a struggle; and the old King, conquered by the weight of years, threw away his stick:

“Shame on us!” he shouted. “Shame on us! Let the Animals deliver us!...”

The Animals were only waiting for this! All wanted to be revenged together. Fortunately, their very eagerness caused a scrimmage which delayed the murder of the dear little ones.

Mytyl uttered piercing screams.

“Don’t be afraid,” said Tyltyl, doing his best to protect her. “I have my knife.”

“The little chap means to die game!” said the Cock.

“That’s the one I shall eat first,” said the Pig, eyeing Mytyl greedily.

“What have I done to all of you?” asked Tyltyl.

“Nothing at all, my little man,” said the Sheep. “Eaten my little brother, my two sisters, my three uncles, my aunt, my grandpapa and my grandmamma.... Wait, wait, when you’re down, you shall see that I have teeth also....”

And so the Sheep and the Horse, who were the greatest cowards, waited for the little fellow to be knocked down before they dared take their share in the spoil.

While they were talking, the Wolf and the Bear treacherously attacked Tyltyl from behind and pushed him over. It was an awful moment. All the Animals, seeing him on the ground, tried to get at him. The boy raised himself to one knee and brandished his knife. Mytyl uttered yells of distress; and, to crown all, it suddenly became dark.

Tyltyl called wildly for assistance:

“Help! Help!... Tyllo! Tyllo!... To the rescue!... Where is Tylette?... Come! Come!...”

The Cat’s voice was heard in the distance, where she was craftily keeping out of sight:

“I can’t come!” she whined. “I’m wounded!”

All this time, plucky little Tyltyl was defending himself as best he could, but he was alone against all of them, felt that he was going to be killed and, in a faltering voice, cried once more:

“Help!... Tyllo! Tyllo!... I can’t hold out!... There are too many of them!... The Bear!... The Pig! The Wolf! The Fir-tree! The Beech!... Tyllo! Tyllo! Tyllo!...”

Then the Dog came leaping along, dragging his broken bonds and elbowing his way through the Trees and Animals and flung himself before his master, whom he defended furiously:

“Here, my little god! Don’t be afraid! Have at them! I know how to use my teeth!”

All the Trees and Animals raised a loud outcry:

“Renegade!... Idiot!... Traitor!... Felon!... Simpleton!... Sneak!... Leave him!... He’s a dead man!... Come over to us!...”

The Dog fought on:

“Never! Never!... I alone against all of you!... Never! Never!... True to the gods, to the best, to the greatest!... Take care, my little master, here’s the Bear!... Look out for the Bull!”

Tyltyl vainly tried to defend himself:

“I’m done for, Tyllo! It was a blow from the Elm! My hand’s bleeding!” And he dropped to the ground. “No, I can hold out no longer!”

“They are coming!” said the Dog. “I hear somebody!... We are saved! It is Light!... Saved! Saved!... See, they’re afraid, they’re retreating!... Saved, my little king!...”

And, sure enough, Light was coming towards them; and with her the dawn rose over the forest, which became light as day.

“What is it?... What has happened?” she asked, quite alarmed at the sight of the little ones and their dear Tyllo covered with wounds and bruises. “Why, my poor boy, didn’t you know? Turn the diamond quickly!”

Tyltyl hastened to obey; and immediately the souls of all the Trees rushed back into their trunks, which closed upon them. The souls of the Animals also disappeared; and there was nothing to be seen but a cow and a sheep browsing peacefully in the distance. The forest became harmless once more; and Tyltyl looked around him in amazement:

“No matter,” he said, “but for the Dog ... and if I hadn’t had my knife!...”

Light thought that he had been punished enough and did not scold him. Besides, she was very much upset by the horrible danger which he had run.

Tyltyl, Mytyl and the Dog, glad to meet again safe and sound, exchanged wild kisses. They laughingly counted their wounds, which were not very serious.

Tylette was the only one to make a fuss:

“The Dog’s broken my paw!” she mewed.

Tyllo felt as if he could have made a mouthful of her:

“Never mind!” he said. “It’ll keep!”

“Leave her alone, will you, you ugly beast?” said Mytyl.

Our friends went back to the Temple of Light to rest after their adventure. Tyltyl, repenting of his disobedience, dared not even mention the Blue Bird of which he had caught a glimpse; and Light said to the Children, gently:

“Let this teach you, dears, that Man is all alone against all in this world. Never forget that.”





Chapter 9　THE LEAVE-TAKING


WEEKS and months had passed since the children’s departure on their journey; and the hour of separation was at hand. Light had been very sad lately; she had counted the days in sorrow, without a word to the Animals and Things, who had no idea of the misfortune that threatened them.

On the day when we see them for the last time, they were all out in the gardens of the temple. Light stood watching them from a marble terrace, with Tyltyl and Mytyl sleeping by her side. Much had happened in the past twelve months; but the life of the Animals and Things, which had no intelligence to guide it, had made no progress, on the contrary. Bread had eaten so much that he was now not able to walk: Milk, devoted as ever, dragged him along in a Bath chair. Fire’s nasty temper had made him quarrel with everybody and he had become very lonely and unhappy in consequence. Water, who had no will of her own, had ended by yielding to Sugar’s sweet entreaties: they were now married; and Sugar presented a most piteous sight. The poor fellow was reduced to a shadow of his former self, shrank visibly day by day and was sillier than ever, while Water, in marrying, had lost her principal charm, her simplicity. The Cat had remained the liar that she always was; and our dear friend Tyllo had never been able to overcome his hatred for her.

“Poor things!” thought Light, with a sigh. “They have not gained much by receiving the benefit of life! They have travelled and seen nothing of all the wonders that surrounded them in my peaceful temple; they were either quarrelling with one another or over-eating themselves until they fell ill. They were too foolish to enjoy their happiness and they will recognize it for the first time presently, when they are about to lose it....”

At that moment, a pretty dove, with silver wings, alighted on her knees. It wore an emerald collar round its neck, with a note fastened to the clasp. The dove was the Fairy Berylune’s messenger. Light opened the letter and read these few words: “Remember that the year is over.” Then Light stood up, waved her wand and everything disappeared from sight.

A few seconds later, the whole company were gathered together outside a high wall with a small door in it. The first rays of the dawn were gilding the tree-tops. Tyltyl and Mytyl, whom Light was fondly supporting with her arms, woke up, rubbed their eyes and looked around them in astonishment.

“What?” said Light to Tyltyl. “Don’t you know that wall and that little door?”

The sleepy boy shook his head: he remembered nothing. Then Light assisted his memory:

“The wall,” she said, “surrounds a house which we left one evening just a year ago today....”

“Just a year ago?... Why, then....” And, clapping his hands with glee, Tyltyl ran to the door. “We must be near Mummy!... I want to kiss her at once, at once, at once!”

But Light stopped him. It was too early, she said: Mummy and Daddy were still asleep and he must not wake them with a start.

“Besides,” she added, “the door will not open till the hour strikes.”

“What hour?” asked the boy.

“The hour of separation,” Light answered, sadly.

“What!” said Tyltyl, in great distress. “Are you leaving us?”

“I must,” said Light. “The year is past. The Fairy will come back and ask you for the Blue Bird.”

“But I haven’t got the Blue Bird!” cried Tyltyl. “The one of the Land of Memory turned quite black, the one of the Future flew away, the Night’s are dead, those in the Graveyard were not blue and I could not catch the one in the Forest!... Will the Fairy be angry?... What will she say?...”

“Never mind, dear,” said Light. “You did your best. And, though you did not find the Blue Bird, you deserved to do so, for the good-will, pluck and courage which you showed.”

Light’s face beamed with happiness as she spoke these words, for she knew that to deserve to find the Blue Bird was very much the same thing as finding it; but she was not allowed to say this, for it was a beautiful mystery, which Tyltyl had to solve for himself. She turned to the Animals and Things, who stood weeping in a corner, and told them to come and kiss the Children.

Bread at once put down the cage at Tyltyl’s feet and began to make a speech:

“In the name of all, I crave permission....”

“You sha’n’t have mine!” cried Fire.

“Order!” cried Water.

“We still have tongues of our own!” roared Fire.

“Yes! Yes!” screamed Sugar, who, knowing that his end was at hand, kept kissing Water and melting before the others’ eyes.

Poor Bread in vain tried to make his voice heard above the din. Light had to interfere and command silence. Then Bread spoke his last words:

“I am leaving you,” he said, between his sobs. “I am leaving you, my dear Children, and you will no longer see me in my living form.... Your eyes are about to close to the invisible life of Things; but I shall be always there, in the bread-pan, on the shelf, on the table, beside the soup, I who am, if I may say so, the most faithful companion, the oldest friend of Man....”

“Well, and what about me?” shouted Fire, angrily.

“Silence!” said Light. “The hour is passing.... Be quick and say good-bye to the Children....”

Fire rushed forward, took hold of the Children, one after the other, and kissed them so violently that they screamed with pain:

“Oh! Oh!... He’s burning me!...”

“Oh! Oh!... He’s scorched my nose!...”

“Let me kiss the place and make it well,” said Water, going up to the children gently.

This gave Fire his chance:

“Take care,” he said, “you’ll get wet.”

“I am loving and gentle,” said Water. “I am kind to human beings....”

“What about those you drown?” asked Fire.

But Water pretended not to hear:

“Love the wells, listen to the brooks,” she said. “I shall always be there. When you sit down in the evening, beside the springs, try to understand what they are trying to say....”

Then she had to break off, for a regular waterfall of tears came gushing from her eyes, flooding all around her. However, she resumed:

“Think of me when you see the water-bottle.... You will find me also in the ewer, the watering-can, the cistern and the tap....”

Then Sugar came up, with a limping walk, for he could hardly stand on his feet. He uttered a few words of sorrow, in an affected voice and then stopped, for tears, he said, were not in harmony with his temperament.

“Humbug!” cried Bread.

“Sugar-plum! Lollipop! Caramel!” yelped Fire.

And all began to laugh, except the two children, who were very sad:

“Where are Tylette and Tyllo gone to?” asked our hero.

At that moment, the Cat came running up, in a terrible state: her hair was on end and dishevelled, her clothes were torn and she was holding a handkerchief to her cheek, as though she had the tooth-ache. She uttered terrible groans and was closely pursued by the Dog, who overwhelmed her with bites, blows and kicks. The others rushed in between them to separate them, but the two enemies continued to insult and glare at each other. The Cat accused the Dog of pulling her tail and putting tin tacks in her food and beating her. The Dog simply growled and denied none of his actions:

“You’ve had some,” he kept saying, “you’ve had some and you’re going to have some more!”

But, suddenly, he stopped and, as he was panting with excitement, it could be seen that his tongue turned quite white: Light had told him to kiss the Children for the last time.

“For the last time?” stammered poor Tyllo. “Are we to part from these poor Children?”

His grief was such that he was incapable of understanding anything.

“Yes,” said Light. “The hour which you know of is at hand.... We are going to return to silence....”

Thereupon the Dog, suddenly realizing his misfortune, began to utter real howls of despair and fling himself upon the Children, whom he loaded with mad and violent caresses:

“No! No!” he cried. “I refuse!... I refuse!... I shall always talk!... And I shall be very good.... You will keep me with you and I shall learn to read and write and play dominoes!... And I shall always be very clean.... And I shall never steal anything in the kitchen again....”

He went on his knees before the two Children, sobbing and entreating, and, when Tyltyl, with his eyes full of tears, remained silent, dear Tyllo had a last magnificent idea: running up to the Cat, he offered, with smiles that looked like grins, to kiss her. Tylette, who did not possess his spirit of self-sacrifice, leaped back and took refuge by Mytyl’s side. Then Mytyl said, innocently:

“You, Tylette, are the only one that hasn’t kissed us yet.”

The Cat put on a mincing tone:

“Children,” said she, “I love you both as much as you deserve.”

There was a pause.

“And now,” said Light, “let me, in my turn, give you a last kiss....”

As she spoke, she spread her veil round them as if she would have wrapped them for the last time in her luminous might. Then she gave them each a long and loving kiss. Tyltyl and Mytyl hung on to her beseechingly:

“No, no, no, Light!” they cried. “Stay here with us!... Daddy won’t mind.... We will tell Mummy how kind you have been.... Where will you go all alone?”...

“Not very far, my Children,” said Light. “Over there to the Land of the Silence of Things.”

“No, no,” said Tyltyl. “I won’t have you go....”

But Light quieted them with a motherly gesture and said words to them which they never forgot. Long after, when they were a grandfather and grandmother in their turn, Tyltyl and Mytyl still remembered them and used to repeat them to their grandchildren.

Here are Light’s touching words:

“Listen, Tyltyl. Do not forget, child, that everything that you see in this world has neither beginning nor end. If you keep this thought in your heart and let it grow up with you, you will always, in all circumstances, know what to say, what to do and what to hope for.”

And, when our two friends began to sob, she added, lovingly:

“Do not cry, my dear little ones.... I have not a voice like Water; I have only my brightness, which Man does not understand.... But I watch over him to the end of his days.... Never forget that I am speaking to you in every spreading moonbeam, in every twinkling star, in every dawn that rises, in every lamp that is lit, in every good and bright thought of your soul....”

At that moment, the grandfather’s clock in the cottage struck eight o’clock. Light stopped for a moment and then, in a voice that grew suddenly fainter, whispered:

“Good-bye!... Good-bye!... The hour is striking!... Good-bye!”

Her veil faded away, her smile became paler, her eyes closed, her form vanished and, through their tears, the children saw nothing but a thin ray of light dying away at their feet. Then they turned to the others ... but these had disappeared....





Chapter 10　THE AWAKENING


THE grandfather’s clock in Tyl the woodcutter’s cottage had struck eight; and his two little Children, Tyltyl and Mytyl, were still asleep in their little beds. Mummy Tyl stood looking at them, with her arms akimbo and her apron tucked up, laughing and scolding in the same breath:

“I can’t let them go on sleeping till mid-day,” she said. “Come, get up, you little lazybones!”

But it was no use shaking them, kissing them or pulling the bed-clothes off them: they kept on falling back upon their pillows, with their noses pointing at the ceiling, their mouths wide open, their eyes shut and their cheeks all pink.

At last, after receiving a gentle thump in the ribs, Tyltyl opened one eye and murmured:

“What?... Light?... Where are you?... No, no, don’t go away....”

“Light!” cried Mummy Tyl, laughing. “Why, of course, it’s light.... Has been for ever so long!... What’s the matter with you?... You look quite blinded....”

“Mummy!... Mummy!” said Tyltyl, rubbing his eyes. “It’s you!...”

“Why, of course, it’s I!... Why do you stare at me in that way?... Is my nose turned upside down, by any chance?”

Tyltyl was quite awake by this time and did not trouble to answer the question. He was beside himself with delight! It was ages and ages since he had seen his Mummy and he never tired of kissing her.

Mummy Tyl began to be uneasy. What could the matter be? Had her boy lost his senses? Here he was suddenly talking of a long journey in the company of the Fairy and Water and Milk and Sugar and Fire and Bread and Light! He made believe that he had been away a year!...

“But you haven’t left the room!” cried Mummy Tyl, who was now nearly beside herself with fright. “I put you to bed last night and here you are this morning! It’s Christmas Day: don’t you hear the bells in the village?...”

“Of course, it’s Christmas Day,” said Tyltyl, obstinately, “seeing that I went away a year ago, on Christmas Eve!... You’re not angry with me?... Did you feel very sad?... And what did Daddy say?...”

“Come, you’re still asleep!” said Mummy Tyl, trying to take comfort. “You’ve been dreaming!... Get up and put on your breeches and your little jacket....”

“Hullo, I’ve got my shirt on!” said Tyltyl.

And, leaping up, he knelt down on the bed and began to dress, while his mother kept on looking at him with a scared face.

The little boy rattled on:

“Ask Mytyl, if you don’t believe me.... Oh, we have had such adventures!... We saw Grandad and Granny ... yes, in the Land of Memory ... it was on our way. They are dead, but they are quite well, aren’t they, Mytyl?”

And Mytyl, who was now beginning to wake up, joined her brother in describing their visit to the grand-parents and the fun which they had had with their little brothers and sisters.

This was too much for Mummy Tyl. She ran to the door of the cottage and called with all her might to her husband, who was working on the edge of the forest:

“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” she cried. “I shall lose them as I lost the others!... Do come!... Come quick....”

Daddy Tyl soon entered the cottage, with his axe in his hand; he listened to his wife’s lamentations, while the two Children told the story of their adventures over again and asked him what he had done during the year.

“You see, you see!” said Mummy Tyl, crying. “They have lost their heads, something will happen to them; run and fetch the doctor....”

But the woodcutter was not the man to put himself out for such a trifle. He kissed the little ones, calmly lit his pipe and declared that they looked very well and that there was no hurry.

At that moment, there came a knock at the door and the neighbour walked in. She was a little old woman leaning on a stick and very much like the Fairy Berylune. The Children at once flung their arms around her neck and capered round her, shouting merrily:

“It’s the Fairy Berylune!”

The neighbour, who was a little hard of hearing, paid no attention to their cries and said to Mummy Tyl:

“I have come to ask for a bit of fire for my Christmas stew.... It’s very chilly this morning.... Good-morning, children....”

Meanwhile, Tyltyl had become a little thoughtful. No doubt, he was glad to see the old Fairy again; but what would she say when she heard that he had not the Blue Bird? He made up his mind like a man and went up to her boldly:

“Fairy Berylune, I could not find the Blue Bird....”

“What is he saying?” asked the neighbor, quite taken aback.

Thereupon Mummy Tyl began to fret again:

“Come, Tyltyl, don’t you know Goody Berlingot?”

“Why, yes, of course,” said Tyltyl, looking the neighbor up and down. “It’s the Fairy Berylune.”

“Bery ... what?” asked the neighbor.

“Berylune,” answered Tyltyl, calmly.

“Berlingot,” said the neighbor. “You mean Berlingot.”

Tyltyl was a little put out by her positive way of talking; and he answered:

“Berylune or Berlingot, as you please, ma’am, but I know what I’m saying....”

Daddy Tyl was beginning to have enough of it:

“We must put a stop to this,” he said. “I will give them a smack or two.”

“Don’t,” said the neighbor; “it’s not worth while. It’s only a little fit of dreaming; they must have been sleeping in the moonbeams.... My little girl, who is very ill, is often like that....”

Mummy Tyl put aside her own anxiety for a moment and asked after the health of Neighbor Berlingot’s little girl.

“She’s only so-so,” said the neighbor, shaking her head. “She can’t get up.... The doctor says it’s her nerves.... I know what would cure her, for all that. She was asking me for it only this morning, for her Christmas present....”

She hesitated a little, looked at Tyltyl with a sigh and added, in a disheartened tone:

“What can I do? It’s a fancy she has....”

The others looked at one another in silence: they knew what the neighbor’s words meant. Her little girl had long been saying that she would get well if Tyltyl would only give her his dove; but he was so fond of it that he refused to part with it....

“Well,” said Mummy Tyl to her son, “won’t you give your bird to that poor little thing? She has been dying to have it for ever so long!...”

“My bird!” cried Tyltyl, slapping his forehead as though they had spoken of something quite out of the way. “My bird!” he repeated. “That’s true, I was forgetting about him!... And the cage!... Mytyl, do you see the cage?... It’s the one which Bread carried.... Yes, yes, it’s the same one, there it is, there it is!”

Tyltyl would not believe his eyes. He took a chair, put it under the cage and climbed on to it gaily, saying:

“Of course, I’ll give him to her, of course, I will!...”

Then he stopped, in amazement:

“Why, he’s blue!” he said. “It’s my dove, just the same, but he has turned blue while I was away!”

And our hero jumped down from the chair and began to skip for joy, crying:

“It’s the Blue Bird we were looking for! We have been miles and miles and miles and he was here all the time!... He was here, at home!... Oh, but how wonderful!... Mytyl, do you see the bird? What would Light say?... There, Madame Berlingot, take him quickly to your little girl....”

While he was talking, Mummy Tyl threw herself into her husband’s arms and moaned:

“You see?... You see?... He’s taken bad again.... He’s wandering....”

Meantime, Neighbor Berlingot beamed all over her face, clasped her hands together and mumbled her thanks. When Tyltyl gave her the bird, she could hardly believe her eyes. She hugged the boy in her arms and wept with joy and gratitude:

“Do you give it me?” she kept saying. “Do you give it me like that, straight away and for nothing?... Goodness, how happy she will be!... I fly, I fly!... I will come back to tell you what she says....”

“Yes, yes, go quickly,” said Tyltyl, “for some of them change their colour!”

Neighbour Berlingot ran out and Tyltyl shut the door after her. Then he turned round on the threshold, looked at the walls of the cottage, looked all around him and seemed wonderstruck:

“Daddy, Mummy, what have you done to the house?” he asked. “It’s just as it was, but it’s much prettier.”

His parents looked at each other in bewilderment; and the little boy went on:

“Why, yes, everything has been painted and made to look like new; everything is clean and polished.... And look at the forest outside the window!... How big and fine it is!... One would think it was quite new!... How happy I feel here, oh, how happy I feel!”

The worthy woodcutter and his wife could not make out what was coming over their son; but you, my dear little readers, who have followed Tyltyl and Mytyl through their beautiful dream, will have guessed what it was that altered everything in our young hero’s view.

It was not for nothing that the Fairy, in his dream, had given him a talisman to open his eyes. He had learnt to see the beauty of things around him; he had passed through trials that had developed his courage; while pursuing the Blue Bird, the Bird of Happiness that was to bring happiness to the Fairy’s little girl, he had become open-handed and so good-natured that the mere thought of giving pleasure to others filled his heart with joy. And, while travelling through endless, wonderful, imaginary regions, his mind had opened out to life.

The boy was right, when he thought everything more beautiful, for, to his richer and purer understanding, everything must needs seem infinitely fairer than before.

Meanwhile, Tyltyl continued his joyful inspection of the cottage. He leaned over the bread-pan to speak a kind word to the Loaves; he rushed at Tyllo, who was sleeping in his basket, and congratulated him on the good fight which he had made in the forest.

Mytyl stooped down to stroke Tylette, who was snoozing by the stove, and said:

“Well, Tylette?... You know me, I see, but you have stopped talking.”

Then Tyltyl put his hand up to his forehead:

“Hullo!” he cried. “The diamond’s gone!... Who’s taken my little green hat?... Never mind, I don’t want it any more!... Ah, there’s Fire! Good-morning, sir! He’ll be crackling to make Water angry!” He ran to the tap, turned it on and bent down over the water. “Good-morning, Water, good-morning!... What does she say?... She still talks, but I don’t understand her as well as I did.... Oh, how happy I am, how happy I am!”

“So am I, so am I!” cried Mytyl.

And our two young friends took each other’s hands and began to scamper round the kitchen.

Mummy Tyl felt a little relieved at seeing them so full of life and spirits. Besides, Daddy Tyl was so calm and placid. He sat eating his porridge and laughing:

“You see, they are playing at being happy!” he said.

Of course, the poor dear man did not know that a wonderful dream had taught his little children not to play at being happy, but to be happy, which is the greatest and most difficult of lessons.

“I like Light best of all,” said Tyltyl to Mytyl, standing on tip-toe by the window. “You can see her over there, through the trees of the forest. To-night, she will be in the lamp. Dear, oh, dear, how lovely it all is and how glad I feel, how glad I....”

He stopped and listened. Everybody lent an ear. They heard laughter and merry voices; and the sounds came nearer.

“It’s her voice!” cried Tyltyl. “Let me open the door!”

As a matter of fact, it was the little girl, with her mother, Neighbor Berlingot.

“Look at her,” said Goody Berlingot, quite overcome with joy. “She can run, she can dance, she can fly! It’s a miracle! When she saw the bird, she jumped, just like that....”

And Goody Berlingot hopped from one leg to the other at the risk of falling and breaking her long, hooked nose.

The Children clapped their hands and everybody laughed.

The little girl was there, in her long white night-dress, standing in the middle of the kitchen, a little surprised to find herself on her feet after so many months’ illness. She smiled and pressed Tyltyl’s dove to her heart.

Tyltyl looked first at the child and then at Mytyl:

“Don’t you think she’s very like Light?” he asked.

“She is much smaller,” said Mytyl.

“Yes, indeed!” said Tyltyl. “But she will grow!...”

And the three Children tried to put a little food down the Bird’s beak, while the parents began to feel easier in their minds and looked at them and smiled.

Tyltyl was radiant. I will not conceal from you, my dear little readers, that the Dove had hardly changed colour at all and that it was joy and happiness that decked him with a magnificent bright blue plumage in our hero’s eyes. No matter! Tyltyl, without knowing it, had discovered Light’s great secret, which is that we draw nearer to happiness by trying to give it to others.

But now something happened. Everybody became excited, the Children screamed, the parents threw up their arms and rushed to the open door: the Bird had suddenly escaped! He was flying away as fast as he could.

“My bird! My bird!” sobbed the little girl.

But Tyltyl was the first to run to the staircase and he returned in triumph:

“It’s all right!” he said. “Don’t cry! He is still in the house and we shall find him again.”

And he gave a kiss to the little girl, who was already smiling through her tears:

“You’ll be sure to catch him again, won’t you?” she asked.

“Trust me,” replied our friend, confidentially. “I now know where he is.”

You also, my dear little readers, now know where the Blue Bird is. Dear Light revealed nothing to the woodcutter’s Children, but she showed them the road to happiness by teaching them to be good and kind and generous.

Suppose that, at the beginning of this story, she had said to them:

“Go straight back home. The Blue Bird is there, in the humble cottage, in the wicker cage, with your dear father and mother who love you.”

The Children would never have believed her:

“What!” Tyltyl would have answered. “The Blue Bird, my dove? Nonsense: my dove is grey!... Happiness, in the cottage? With Daddy and Mummy? Oh, I say! There are no toys at home and it’s awfully boring there: we want to go ever so far and meet with tremendous adventures and have all sorts of fun....”

That is what he would have said; and he and Mytyl would have set out in spite of everything, without listening to Light’s advice, for the most certain truths are good for nothing if we do not put them to the test ourselves. It only takes a moment to tell a child all the wisdom in the world, but our whole lives are not long enough to help us understand it, because our own experience is our only light.

Each of us must seek out happiness for himself; and he has to take endless pains and undergo many a cruel disappointment before he learns to become happy by appreciating the simple and perfect pleasures that are always within easy reach of his mind and heart.
