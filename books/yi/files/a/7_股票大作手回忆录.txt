第一章


中学刚一毕业，我就走上了工作岗位，在一家股票经纪行做记价员。在学校，我学过三年数学，对数字最有感觉了，心算更是我的强项。每天在客户室，把最新的股票成交价格写到那块木质的大报价板上，就是我的工作内容。有个客户时常会坐在收报机旁边，大声地报出最新的股票价格。他速度很快，但我并不以为然，记住这些数字对我而言，没有任何问题。

办公室有很多工作人员，我结交了一些朋友。不过，当市场交易进入活跃期时，从上午十点能一直忙到下午三点，我根本没有时间与他们多说几句话。其实这也没什么可在意的，因为是工作时间嘛。

市场交易虽然繁忙，但并没影响到我对工作的思考。对我来说，那些报价与股票价格无关，它们只是一些数字，虽然它们代表的确实是一直处于变化状态的每股几美元。变化本身才是我最感兴趣的地方。为什么变化？我不清楚，不关心，也从不会去想，我只看着它们一直在变。我关心的是，从周一到周五，每天五个小时，周六也有两个小时，它们一直在变化。

自此以后，对数字有很强记忆力的我，开始对价格波动有了兴趣。我能够牢记价格在涨跌头一天的波动状况。我的心算优点经常会有用武之地。

比如，我发现股票在涨跌前都有某种固定模式的倾向。类似实例不胜枚举，我从中能够获得很多预测性的发现。当时只有14岁的我，查阅分析了特别多的股价行情资料后，开始对它们的精确度展开预测，对现时和以往的股市行情进行比较。没过多久，我就能够预测股价了。如前所说，我唯一依据，就是股市以往的表现。这正如我提前获知了情报一般，我开始期望股价朝我预计的方向波动。我为它们数着时间呢。

有时你或许会发现，在有些地方买进比卖出稍有优势。股票市场正在进行一场战争，而历史股价记录就是你的望远镜，它会让你胜算很大。

我很早就学到了另外一个经验：在华尔街没有什么事情是新鲜的，因为这里的投机行当已如山脉一般古老。今天股市发生的事情，过去就曾发生过，而且将来还会继续发生。我一直牢记着这一点。我觉得自己想过要努力把它们是在什么时候发生的、怎样发生的牢牢记住，但其实那些都是我在交易过程中通过学习记进脑子的。

我对这个游戏的兴趣非常浓厚，我开始迫不及待地预测所有那些能引起我注意的活跃股票的跌涨，我把我的观察数据记录在新买的小本上。这并不像很多人所做的模拟交易的记录。很多人这样做只是模拟地赚赔了几百万美元，却不会热昏头，或进穷人收容所。我的本子记录的是或成功或失败的预测。我记下了预估的股价走向，对它们进行验证，这是我最大的兴趣点，也就是说，我关心的是我分析得是不是正确。

例如，我花一整天研究了一只活跃股票的波动后就能确定，此时它跟以往在突破8个或10个点之前的表现一样。平时我会在周一记下股票名和当时的价格，然后查看它之前的变动行情，写下它在周二和周三的可能性走向，然后等着股价记录来验证我的判断。

最开始，我就是这么对股价记录信息产生兴趣的。在对股价的涨跌观察过程中，我有了波动的概念。股价的波动自然有它的原因，但股价记录不会对股价变化做什么解释，它不会对你说明股价变化的原因。14岁时，我不会去钻研股价涨跌的原因，如今我已40岁，仍然不会想去弄清楚。或许，过了两三天、几星期甚至几个月后，你仍然搞不明白今天股价变化的原因，但这又如何？你的生意在当下，你要做决断的时间在今天，不会是明天。而想找出股价变化的原因，这个可以等，不过你要么见机而行，要么错失良机。类似的事情，我也不知道看到过多少次了。你记得空管公司的股票在几天前突然跌了3个点，而此时别的股票价格却已经回稳，这就是事实。一周后，你通过报道得知，董事们通过了分红方案，这就是原因。董事们知道股价走向，虽然他们没有卖掉手中的股票，可至少他们没有买进。内部都不支持股价，它怎么可能不跌。

我的备忘小本保存了大概六个月。我继续工作并没回家，并接着记下那些感兴趣的股票价格，研究它们的变化，死盯相同或相似的波动状况，学习怎么看股票行情记录，虽然我当时并没有意识到这一点。

一天，我吃午饭的时候，办公室一位稍稍比我年长的同事过来找我，悄悄问我有没有带钱。

“你要干什么？”我问。

“是这样的，”他说，“我得知了一个关于伯灵顿公司的利好消息，如果能找人来帮忙，我就要趁机玩上一次。”

“玩上一次，什么意思？”凭我的记忆，能玩这个游戏的都是老到的富人，需要成千上万美元才行。那些有自己的马车、雇得起戴丝绸帽子的车夫的人，才有资本玩。

“我就是想玩一把！”他说，“你带了多少钱？”

“你需要多少钱？”

“嗯，我如果交上5美元保证金，就能买5股伯灵顿。”

“你要怎么玩？”

“我要找家对赌行，把钱放进去做保证金，他们能让我买多少，我就买多少吧。”他说，“我能确定我们很快会赚上一倍，像捡钱一样容易。”

“等等。”我边说边掏出了我的小备忘本。

我对钱能翻一倍并不感兴趣，不过他说伯灵顿股票要上涨，那我的小本子应该有所显示才对。是的，我找到了，根据我的记录，伯灵顿股票此时的表现就像它以往上涨前的表现一样。我从没买卖过什么东西，也没和别人一起赌过什么，不过我觉得这的确是一次能检验我的工作与爱好的良机，我立马就被吸引了。我的预测如果不符合真实的股票行情，就不会有人对我的研究产生兴趣了。于是我把身上所有的钱都给了他，他带着凑到的钱去附近的对赌行买了一些伯灵顿股票。过了两天，我们套现后，我赚了3.12美元。

有了第一次交易，我就开始在对赌行单干。我总利用休息时间买进或者抛售股票——买与卖对我而言没有不同。我按照我自己总结的方法交易股票，并非只去买卖我喜欢的股票，同时我不理会人们的各种交易建议，只注重那些数字。其实在对赌行里，我的这种操作方式非常理想。交易的人们在对赌行干的只是照着印在行情记录上的股价波动下赌注的活儿。

没过多久，我通过股票交易赚来的钱就远远超过了那份记录员工作挣的钱。于是我就辞职了，虽然家人很反对，但他们看到我赚了钱，就不再过多指责。我就是个孩子，做那份工作挣不了几个钱，可在炒股上却干得很漂亮啊。

15岁时，我赚到了平生的第一个1000美元。我把这短短几个月里在对赌行赚到的1000美元拿到了我母亲面前，这还不包括我之前带到家里的那些钱。我母亲不停地说我，让我把钱存进银行以免受到诱惑。她说，从来没有见过哪个15岁的小男孩赚过这么多钱，而且她好像都不太相信这些钱是真的，很担心这些钞票。我不过多地考虑其他事情，只要能这样长期做可以验证我的判断游戏就行。这是我全部的乐趣——思考，然后正确地做判断。有时候我买10股，验证我的推测是否正确，有时候我会买100股，我的正确程度会增加10倍，这就是保证金增加对我的意义——我可以正确得更彻底。这需要更大的勇气吗？不，这并无不同。如果我只有10美元，全都拿去冒险，比我有100万美元，再拿另一个100万美元去冒险勇敢多了。

不管怎么说，我15岁的时候就已经通过股市赚了很多钱。刚开始那会儿，我在一些规模小的对赌行玩，在这样的地方一次买卖20股就算是个大户了。那个年代，对赌行对客户没有优待一说，他们根本不必如此，就算有人把股市行情摸准了，他们也有办法把客户的保证金榨取掉。这一行本就是利润丰厚。那时候，经营对赌行并不违法，每天都有大量炒股人的钱在股价涨跌的同时被对赌行老板赚进腰包。股市价格只要朝着不利于股友们的方向变动0.75点，他们之前交的那点保证金就会输光，一点儿都不会引起人们的关注；而如果有人赖账的话，就再也不会有继续玩这个游戏的机会了，只能远离股市。

我没有合伙人，自给自足，喜欢单干。我靠思维赚钱，不是吗？股市行情与我的预期相同，我不会让别人锦上添花；股市行情与我的预期相悖，也不可能有人能让它停住，因此我不会跟别人谈论我炒股的事情。我身边是有不少朋友，不过我就是爱在股市中独来独往。一直如此，原因就是这样。

每次都一样，过不了多久对赌行就被我的炒股水平震撼，他们很不高兴。终于，有一次我去柜台交保证金的时候，对面的瘪三虽然眼睛直勾勾地盯着钱，却根本不拿，他们这是不想再跟我做生意了。从此，我赢得了一个“投机分子”的名号。我只能屡屡更换对赌行，一家又一家。再后来，我连假名字这招都用上了。我不得不万分小心，开始只少量买15到20股。在发现我受到他们怀疑时，我也会故意放水输些小钱，然后再反戈一击。只是，他们也不是吃素的，会很快明白我是个让他们受累的客户，于是逼我离开，省得影响他们对赌行老板们的生意。

有一天，我正交易的对赌行拒绝了我的生意，这可是一家大对赌行，而且我已经在这里玩了好几个月了。我暗暗告诉自己，一定要在这里发些财。他们有许多分行，有的在酒店大厅，有的在附近小镇。我瞅准一家分行，进去跟他们的经理随便聊了聊，就准备交易。但是，我才刚使出真功夫操作一只能赚钱的股票时，经理收到了这家对赌行总部的电话，那头的人质问是谁在玩这只股票。经理来对我讲这件事，我告诉他，我的名字叫爱德华·罗宾森，剑桥人。他高兴地通过电话向老板报告这一消息，但是电话那头的人想知道我长什么样子，我告诉经理：“你就说我是个长着浓黑头发和大胡子的矮胖子。”可是经理还是实话实说了，然后他一脸通红地撂下电话。

“他们说你什么了？”我礼节性地问。

“说我眼瞎了，是个笨蛋，难道没告诉过我不跟你拉里·利文斯顿做交易吗？还说我故意让你赚走了700美元。”他说完后就闭上了嘴。

我换来换去，所有的分店都对我很熟悉了，根本不让我玩，就像我用假钱在炒股一样。更甚的是，哪怕我只是看看股价行情，也会被对赌行的人冷眼相对。我试图说服他们允许我间隔久一点儿，分散到所有不同的分店去交易，也吃了闭门羹。

到后来，只有一家股票经纪行可以去了。它是行业内最牛最有钱的机构——柯斯莫斯普利坦股票经纪公司。

这家公司声誉特别好，生意也很兴隆，在新英格兰的每个工业化城镇都开了分公司。他们自然不会把我拒于门外。我在这里交易股票，有时候能赚钱，有时候也会赔钱，不过到最后我还是一如既往地是个赢家。他们与之前其他地方不一样，不会直接斩断我做生意的门路，这并不是因为他们有多高的职业道德，而是他们怕被媒体知道不给碰巧赚了钱的人继续交易的机会，这样会引起众怒的。可是，他们接下来的所作所为更令人不齿，居然让我支付3个点的保证金和额外溢价。刚开始，溢价只有0.5个点，然后是1个点，最后竟然涨成了1.5个点。那可真麻烦！怎么说呢？容易得很！假设市价90美元时我买美国钢铁公司的股票，成交价一般是90又1/8美元，如果交1个点的保证金买了股票，就意味着当股价跌破89又1/4美元的时候，我的保证金就全没有了。对赌行不会对你言明，说要补交保证金了，而是直接在你输了后不知情的情况下，清理了你的账户。

但是柯斯莫斯普利坦公司有额外的溢价，客户就更加容易被干掉。举个同样的例子，如果市价90美元时我买美国钢铁公司的股票，他们会按照91又1/8美元的成交价给我。至于原因，他们说当我买这只股票的时候，价格有上涨1又1/4个点的可能。此时，即便我赶紧按照市价卖掉，也依然赔钱。而且，他们光靠着这3个点的保证金，就能把我的交易能力砍掉三分之二。可是没办法，这是唯一允许我玩的地方，如果不接受这个条件，就只能放弃炒股。

不过，我账面上的钱虽然有赚有赔，但结果我还是稳赚的。只是呢，柯斯莫斯普利坦公司对我还是不满意，依他们那个苛刻条件，想干掉谁都没问题，他们也想让我钻进他们下的圈套里，可我就是能凭第六感摆脱那些困境——他们还嫩了点。

我说过，柯斯莫斯普利坦公司是我最常去的最后一家股票公司，作为新英格兰最牛的对赌行，他们不规定客户交易数量。我每天都会去玩一把，我可能是他们公司里最大的个人炒股手了。以我的见识，这家公司的交易厅和报价板都是最上档次的。看板铺满整个大厅，一切行市价格都在上面，有纽约和波士顿股票交易所的股票，也有棉花、小麦、金属等期货，反正只要能在纽约、芝加哥、波士顿、利物浦买卖的东西，这里都有。

你想知道在对赌行该怎么玩吗？你只要把钱交给工作人员，说清楚你要买卖哪只股票，他就会看行情表和报价板，把最新的成交价格和时间填在单子上。你拿到的成交单上会写清你买卖这只股票的名称、成交价格、时间、日期、保证金数额。一旦你想卖出，就去跟那个工作人员或者其他工作人员说明情况，他会写下最新的成交价格，如果你交易的股票不活跃，他会等下个成交价出来。记录了价格和时间后，他会把单子给你，你拿着单子去柜台兑取现金就可以了。当然了，如果你交易的这只股票行情不好，股价比你的保证金价位还低，你的交易就会自动被清算，成交单也就变成废纸一张。

在小型对赌行里，可以交易的股数比较少，一般只有5股，成交单是五颜六色的小纸条。当奔放的牛市到来时，所有人都在做多头，而且常常赚钱，这样对赌行的损失肯定比较惨。而对赌行就会向炒股的人收买卖进出手续费，比如你按照市价20美元买了一只股票，成交价是20又1/4美元，而你的保证金只能允许你的股票经受3/4点的波动。

但是，柯斯莫斯普利坦公司，这家新英格兰的老大，拥有成千上万的客户，而我可能是唯一一个让他们心里不踏实的客户。无论是那些沉重的溢价，还是3个点的保证金，都不会迫使我降低交易数额。一直以来，我买卖的数额都是他们允许交易范围内最大的，有时候甚至能达到5000股。

也罢，请允许我对你讲一件有趣的交易往事吧。有一次，我做空了制糖公司的3500股，拿到了各500股的七张粉红色的成交单。柯斯莫斯普利坦公司的成交单偏大，许多空白的地方可以写补交过保证金的情况，不过他们从来都不让客户补交保证金，因为你交的保证金越少对他们越有利，他们就是通过炒股者输掉保证金赚钱的。在一些小型对赌行，如果炒股者为了维持住手中的股票，需要追加保证金时，他们会给他开一张新成交单，因为这样可以另赚一笔手续费，客户的保证金也只能经受3/4点的波动，对赌行把这当作股民一次新的交易，向他们收卖出手续费也就变得理所当然了。

那次，我记得手里有超过1万美元的保证金。

我赚取到平生第一个1万美元的时候才20岁。你肯定记得前面我提到过我母亲。你或许觉得1万美元是个不菲的数目，除了洛克菲勒不会有人随身带那么多钱，我母亲也时常对我说，我过去的那些所作所为足以让她满足了，还是要做点实际的事情。我花了不少精力向她解释，我不是靠运气，而是利用精深的计算能力在赚钱。她觉得1万美元是个大数目，可是对我来说只不过就是一笔多一点儿的保证金。

我以105又1/4的价格放空了3500股后，一个名叫亨利·威廉斯的人也放空了2500股。我经常会坐在股票行情接收机旁边，向在报价板旁边站着的工作人员大喊股价。股价如我所预期的那样，很明显地跌落了几个点后，停了下来，这就像在继续跌之前歇一会儿一样。股市表现得很脆弱，很多方面都表现出有利于我的局势。可是此时我对貌似不稳定的股市感到些许不安，这让我不太满意，我想着应该退出来才是。当时的实际价格是103——当天的最低价——本来我应该信心足一点儿，可是我觉得事情不如我所料，估计我不明白的什么地方出错了吧。如果发生什么预料之外的事，我又没有搞清楚，就没办法很有效地阻止自己受损失，因此我想，还是尽早退出来比较安心。

你知道的，我不会无目的地去玩，那不是我的喜好，我也从来没那样玩过。就算我还小的时候，也总是有的放矢。可这次我却找不到确切的理由来进行下去，现在的我心感不安，我没办法再忍受下去了。我赶紧叫过来我认识的那个名叫大卫·威曼的小伙子，对他说：“大卫，你过来替我挡一会儿，我觉得你可以替我一阵，在你报出制糖公司的下一次成交价前，先小挺一下可否？”

他说可以，然后就坐到我让出的位子上，为记价员喊股价。我掏出那七张制糖公司的单子朝柜台走去，可我真不知道为什么要退出来，我只能直愣愣地站着，斜倚在柜台上，单子就在我手里攥着，我怕柜台后的工作人员会看见。没多久，电报机就发出了敲击声，柜台后的工作人员汤姆·本汉姆立马扭头去看，我忽然感到有什么阴谋在滋生，于是下决心当机立断。大卫·威曼也开始报价了，他刚说出：“制糖……”我就嗖一下把单子扔到柜台上，大喊道：“平了制糖公司。”这些举动在大卫的报价喊出来之前就完成了，所以对赌行就必须要按照前面的价格跟我成交。大卫报出的价格还是103。

我预测制糖公司的股价应该已经跌破103。电报机的不正常让我预感有什么阴谋，它像得了疯牛病一样，汤姆·本汉姆也迟疑着不在我的成交单上做记录，而是密切注意着电报机的声音，好像在等待什么。我对他嚷道：“喂，汤姆，你等什么呢？赶紧给我记上啊，103，快点啊！”

交易大厅所有人都听到了我的声音，齐刷刷扭过头来，问什么情况。你要知道，柯斯莫斯普利坦公司不可能会耍赖，你不用怀疑，如果挤兑在对赌行里出现，就会跟在银行发生一样可怕。要是有哪怕一个人产生猜疑，其他人就会跟从。所以汤姆只得铁青着脸走过来，在我的成交单子上写下了“轧平，103”。写完后他把单子猛地推向我，一脸没好气。

从汤姆的桌子到出纳窗口距离不足八英尺，但是我还没有走到出纳那里去拿钱，就听到机器旁边的大卫很激动地大叫：“老天啊，制糖公司108！”不过一切都已晚矣，我抑制不住情绪，只好笑着对汤姆说：“呵呵，刚刚不该是这样吧，老兄？”

这事当然是阴谋。我和亨利·威廉斯一共放空了制糖公司的6000股，失掉了我们的保证金，而且还有其他客户也放空了制糖公司的股票，可能总共有8000到1万股。假如他们收了2万美元的保证金，就足够让他们在纽约股票交易所里拉抬股价，把我们一锅端掉，稳赚一把。那个时代，当对赌行发现同一只股票的多头单子太多时，就会在交易所找些经纪人，共同打压股价，让股民们的那点保证金没办法承受，股民们就不得不低价售出手中的股票。如此一来，对赌行只要小小地操纵几百股，用不了多少钱，就可以获利几千、几万美元。

柯斯莫斯普利坦公司对以我和亨利为代表的做空了制糖公司股票的股民们所做的事情就是这样。纽约股票交易所里有他们的人，他们把股价哄抬到了108，虽然股价不久就会回落下去，但是亨利和很多空头都被他们洗劫了。“对赌行出击”，这就是一旦股票市场出现突发的涨跌事件，然后重新恢复正常后，报纸对它的说法。

更搞笑的是，还没过十天，又出事了。一个绰号叫“大熊”的纽约股民，一下子让柯斯莫斯普利坦公司损失了7万美元。他是纽交所会员，在炒股这一行非常有名。1896年股市出现“布莱恩恐慌”时，他曾一度做空，树立了赫赫威名。交易所有些制度一直阻止他以牺牲别人的利益来牟取不义之财，但他一直不断挑战这些制度。一次，他想出了个点子，就是从那些对赌行里拐走些赃钱，这肯定不会招致交易所和警察局的怨言。他找了35个人，打扮成股民的样子，让他们分潜到柯斯莫斯普利坦公司总部和其他分部，按照提前计划的时间节点，依照对赌行规定的最高数额买进同一只股票，再在能够获得一定利润的时候抛售。他把这只股票的大量利好消息告诉自己的伙伴们后，就到股票交易所里拉抬股价，那些场内的工作人员一起帮助他，因为在他们眼中他是个有职业道德的人。他们挑选了合适的股票，把价格抬高了三四个点，并没有遇到什么问题，而他派出的那些人在对赌行里就真的依计获得了很高的利润。

一个知道详情的哥们儿告诉我，“大熊”在这次行动中获得了7万美元的暴利，他的党羽也获得了相应的酬劳。这个人在全国各地玩了好几次这样的把戏，对纽约、波士顿、费城、芝加哥、辛辛那提、圣路易斯等城市的那些大型对赌行造成了很大冲击。他最喜欢利用西部联合公司的股票，这是一只很容易操纵的股票。他的党羽按照提前计划好的价格买进股票，等到涨了2个点后卖出，改为做空，再赚3个点的钱。最近我看到这个人去世的消息，据说他死得非常潦倒，没引起多少关注。如果在1896年的时候他死了的话，一定会登上纽约每一家报纸的头版头条，可是现在他只是在报纸第五版上被勉强报道了两行字而已。





第二章


在柯斯莫斯普利坦公司阴险地用卑劣手段，向我设置3个点的保证金和1.5个点的溢价，而且都没办法引我上当后，就暗示我说不想再跟我交易了。于是没过多久，我就做出了去纽约的决定，我可以到纽交所会员的公司里继续玩。我之所以不想去波士顿，是因为在那里，股票行情报价也是通过电报机传达的，我想去的是报价的原始来源处。我带着2500美元，踏上了纽约的土地，那年我21岁。

我之前说过，20岁那年我就赚了人生中的第一个1万美元。我虽然在玩制糖公司股票的时候，光保证金就交过1万美元，但是我也不可能一直在赚钱。我玩股票的方式很精深，赚的钱肯定比亏损的多。我如果一直用那种方式玩股票，大概百分之七十的时候在赚钱。每次还没交易，我就知道我是对的，这时候我就稳赚不赔。我之所以有赔钱的时候，就是因为我没有一直用我的方式。也就是说，只有当股市的发展跟我的判断相符时，我再去买卖股票才好。做什么事情都得讲究时机，可是我当时没在意这个。华尔街上那些智力超群的投资者们之所以也会失败，原因也是这个。有些超级大笨蛋每一次都会做出错误选择。而华尔街上的那些笨蛋觉得，要持续不断地一直交易才行。就像没有谁每天都会去买卖股票一样，也没有谁具备每次交易都赚钱的智慧。

我就亲自证明了这个观点。我按照经验寻得交易良机的时候，就能稳赚；但当我在不合适的时候交易，就会赔钱。我不是例外，对吧？交易大厅里的大报价板上，显示着不断变化的股市行情。股民们都在交易的氛围中，手里的一张张成交单变成钱，或者变成了废纸。我的理智自然也受到了情绪影响。在对赌行，你那点保证金只是九牛一毛，不可能做长线交易，用不了几下就被清扫掉了。一次次的胡乱交易是华尔街的那些投资者本金屡屡受损的主要原因，就算是非常专业的投资人也难以逃脱。他们觉得每天都能赚钱回家，仿佛在做着一份固定工作一样。要知道，我当时只是个孩子，不明白我后来学到的那些东西。15年后，我通过那些经验走上了成功之道。15年后的我能蛰伏两周，寻觅到合适的股价，买一只股票，盯着它涨30点。后来，我也亏过些钱，我想过要重新赚回来，不过我要依照对的方式来，不能再轻易出击，我需要耐着性子等待。这是发生在1915年的一个冗长的故事，时机成熟后我会讲出来。现在，我们言归正传吧。我在对赌行玩了几年股票，赚了很多钱，但是最后我还是让它吞掉了我的大部分收入。

更何况，这事就清晰地发生在我眼皮底下。更有甚者，后来同样发生过类似的事情。玩股票的人，必须要打败很多东西，包括自己。无论如何，我揣着2500美元踏进了纽约。不过，我找不到一家值得信任的对赌行。纽交所和警察局管得很严，切断了对赌行的生财之道。

我要寻一个可以自由施展的交易场所，而我唯一的弱项就是财力不足。当时，我交易的数额比较小，可我不想这样下去。一开始玩股票，最重要的是要寻找一家有公平规则的经纪公司。所以我找到一家纽交所会员公司，那家公司原本在我家乡也有分店，分店里几个人是我认识的，不过他们已经倒闭很久了。不久后，因为很讨厌一个合伙人，我就离开了那里，转战到了富勒顿公司。我觉得肯定是有人向他们提到过我的过去，到那里没多长时间，他们就给我封了个“投机分子”的绰号。我貌似很年轻的长相，为我的工作带来了一些便利。但有大量的人看我年少无知，都想着要利用我一番，我就得学会自我保护。对赌行的小伙计们都以为我是个笨蛋，认为我能战胜他们只是因为我有绝佳的运气。

可是，还不到半年时间，我就输光了所有钱。我在股市上表现得很亢奋，也赢得了个不败的名气。我猜想自己曾经交纳过数目不菲的手续费，虽然赚了很多钱，但结果还是输给了股市。即使我处处小心，也还是难免功亏一篑，原因就是，我在对赌行里太成功了。

我只会利用我的那些方法，在对赌行里赚钱，冲着股价的涨跌买卖。我有很强的股市行情观察力，当我买股票的时候，价格就写在报价板明处，就算在买进之前，我也清楚要成交的股价。我总能寻机立马抛售股票，买卖做得很迅速，所以总能把握十足地玩转股票。买对的时候，我就加把劲儿；买错的时候，我就赶紧撤出来。比如，有时候，我能确定某只股票可以至少上升1个点，我不会特别贪心，我交上1个点的保证金，很快就能把本金翻上一番；要么我赚上0.5个点也行。每天玩个一二百股，持续一个月后，也还真是可以，对吧？

不过，就算对赌行有足够承担损失的资本，他们也不会坐以待毙。对赌行不喜欢总能赚到钱的那些人。

总而言之，在对赌行里玩的那些手段，在富勒顿公司就起不了多大作用，在这里，我需要正儿八经地买卖股票。比如，我觉得股价为105时制糖公司的股票会跌落3个点。其实当电报机上传来的股价是105时，交易所里的价格可能是104或者103。这个时候，我下单卖1000股，让富勒顿公司的人去执行时，股价可能变得更低。在我看到回报单之前，是不会知道到底以多少钱卖出了1000股的。这种活儿，如果在对赌行我就能赚3000美元，但是在股票交易所里，可能一毛钱都赚不到。当富勒顿公司的股市行情收报机迟钝地传回股价时，股票交易所的真实交易价格早就变了，我用老到过时的信息做着交易，却没有及时明白过来。

而且，我做大单子的时候，卖出去时会把交易所的市价压低，可在对赌行里，根本不用操心这一点。由于纽交所里股票游戏规则与对赌行完全不同，我亏了很多钱。这并不是说我到纽约正规的地方做正规的股票交易了就会亏钱，而是因为我对现实情况不了解。之前总说我的分析预测能力很强，可是这点小能力对我没多少益处。如果我属于交易所的场内人员，直接去买卖股票，效果可能会好得多。

反正，我就是没掌握炒股的全部技巧，只是学会了特别重要的一部分，而这部分在过去给了我很大的帮助。可是，当我懂得这些的时候，都竟然在亏损，更别提那些没一丁点经验的菜鸟了，他们更没什么赚钱的可能了。

很快，我发现我的方法不适合形势了，可我也不知道到底哪里出了问题。我按照我的方法玩，有时候也起作用，可有时候会遭受一连串的损失。别忘了，我才22岁，不是因为我自信到了不想纠错的地步，而是作为这个时段的年轻人，没有一个人懂得那么多事。

交易大厅的人都很友善。我不能任意胡为，也要考虑他们在保证金上的限制。老富勒顿和公司其他人都对我不错，六个月后，我不光赔了带来的所有钱，还倒欠了公司几百块。在他们眼中，我就是个孩子，刚开始出门，就磕碰得一塌糊涂。可我自己知道，这些都是因为我的炒股方法出了差错，而不是我个人的问题。无论我是否确实清醒，但我总让自己很冷静，没有怀疑过计价器上显示的那些股价。对市场生气根本起不到任何作用。我迫切地想继续展开炒股行动，一刻都不想再迟疑，于是只好去找老富勒顿，跟他说：“我说，富勒顿啊，再借我500美元吧。”

“干吗呀？”他这样问。

“我需要一些钱用啊。”

“到底干什么？”他又问了一遍。

“还不就是交保证金。”我答道。

“500？”他皱着眉头问，“你明白吧，要你交一成的保证金，100股，要交1000美元。把账记在这儿。”

“不是这样。”我说，“我不在这上面记，我已经欠了公司的钱。我是向你个人借500美元，请允许我赚了钱再回来。”

“你有什么打算？”老富勒顿问我。

“我去对赌行玩一把。”我对他说。

“就在这儿玩吧。”他说。

“不行啊，”我说，“在这里我没必胜的把握，只有在对赌行我才信心十足，在那儿我有我的玩法。我现在明白在这里我为什么会亏钱了。”

借了老富勒顿的钱后，我就离开了这家让我输得赤条条的地方。我不能回家乡，那里的对赌行都对我避之唯恐不及。纽约也不行，这座城市那时根本没有对赌行这样的行当。有人对我说，早先的时候，宽街和新街有很多这样的场所，但当我现在需要它们时，已经一家都没有了。考虑再三后，我决定去圣路易斯，据说那边有两家公司，在中西部生意做得很大，赚了很多钱，还在好多城市开了分号呢。其实，光看交易额，东部没有一家公司跟他们在一个档次上。他们对外公开营业，很多厉害角色都在那里交易股票。有人甚至对我说，那边有个公司的老板还是商会副会长。不管怎样，我带着借到的500美元去了那边，想着赚钱后再到富勒顿公司交保证金。

到达圣路易斯后，我先住下来梳洗了一番，就去大街上找对赌行了。我找到了那两家，杜兰公司和泰勒公司。我自信能够赢到钱，我要用绝对有把握绝对安全的方式去玩。我担心会被人认出来，然后被勒令不许交易，因为整个美国的对赌行都知道我这个“投机分子”的事情。他们和赌场是一样的，耳目非常灵通。

杜兰公司离得近些，所以我先从近处开始，争取在他们赶我之前能有几天时间玩一把。我走进阔气的交易大厅，看到了两百来人在那里紧盯着股票价格看。我感觉很惬意，有这么多人，我就不会轻易暴露。我看了一阵股价板，选好了今天要交易的第一只股票。

我环顾四周，看到窗边股民们交保证金和拿成交单的地方有值守的工作人员，他正看着我。我走过去问道：“这里是交易棉花和小麦期货的地方吗？”

“是的，哥们儿。”他答道。

“我可以买股票吧？”我问。

“有钱就可以啊。”他说。

“哦，有啊，不差钱。”我像个娃娃一样炫耀着。

“有吗？真有？”他笑了。

“100美元能买多少？”我假装生气了。

“100美元，100股。”

“我有100。哦，有200，200都有。”我说。

“呵，想不到啊。”他有些吃惊。

“给我来200股。”我迫切地说。

“买什么？”他认真起来，开始正常交谈。

我看着报价板，做出动脑筋的样子：“200股俄马哈公司吧。”

“没问题。”他说。收了钱后，他为我填好了成交单。

“姓名？”他问道。

我说：“霍拉斯·肯特。”

他把单子递了过来，我接过来后就去股民中间等股价。就这样闪电出击，做了好几把。第二天也顺利完成了交易，前后共赚了2800美元。我心中期待着能玩一周最好。按照这种频率和赚法，我一星期能赚到很多钱，完了再去其他地方，要是有一样好的运气的话，我就能够心满意足地打道回纽约了。

第三天清晨，我假装不好意思地走到窗口，准备买500股BRT公司时，那个工作人员对我说话了：“嗨，肯特先生，老板请你去聊聊。”

我清楚是事情出问题了，不过还是装出一无所知的样子问：“老板要跟我谈什么？”

“这个就不清楚了。”

“他在哪里？”

“在他办公室里，那边可以进去。”他指了一下门。

我进去后，老板杜兰从桌旁转身对我说：“坐吧，利文斯顿。”他朝一把椅子指了一下。

我心中一惊，希望顿时化为灰烬。我并不清楚他是怎么知道我是谁的，估计是在住处查到的吧。

“你找我干吗？”我问他。

“你听清楚，小子，我不是要阻止你，知道吗？我没有一点儿跟你作对的意思，清楚吗？”

“不清楚，我不清楚你什么意思。”我这样回答。

他从椅子上起身——嚯，好雄壮啊！他对我说：“你靠近点，利文斯顿。”说着，他走到门口，开门后指着交易大厅的人群问我，“看见了吗？”

“什么？”

“那些人啊。你看他们，小子，一共有300人！300个笨蛋！他们养活了我和我的家人，明白吗？300人！结果你就来了，用两天时间，把我花了两周从这些笨蛋身上赚到的钱给弄走了。这不是公平的生意啊，小子——别跟我来这套不公平的。我不难为你，你也该满意地刹车了。我不会再给你机会了，不会了。”

“为什么？我——”

“就这样吧。前两天我见你来了，就不喜欢你那样。总而言之，我讨厌你这人。我知道你是个厉害角色。我叫进来那个傻蛋……”说着，他指了一下那个一脸愧意的工作人员后继续说，“我向他问了你的交易情况，他告诉了我，我就正告他说：‘我很讨厌那个小子，他是个坑蒙拐骗的主儿！’那个傻蛋却说不可能，说你叫霍拉斯·肯特，是很实诚的一个好小伙儿，没什么问题。我这才随了他，而结果却是这个傻蛋害我损失了2800美元啊。我对你不小气吧，小子。但是，现在我的金库关闭了，你甭想再进来。”

“听我说——”我想继续解释。

“你听我说，利文斯顿，”他说，“我知道你是谁，我要赚能赚到的那些傻瓜的钱，你不属于这类人，我是个遵守规则的人，你从我这儿赚到的钱你尽管带走，但如果再让你赚下去，我就是个笨蛋了。我现在知道你了，你赶紧滚蛋，小子。”

我只好带着赚到的2800美元，从杜兰公司的交易大厅走出来。泰勒公司的交易大厅也在这条街上不远处，我知道泰勒也是富豪，有几家对赌行，我要去那里赚钱。我思考着，是要循序渐进，还是一步到位玩1000股，我可能只有一天的时间，他们一旦发现情形不对，就会吃一堑长一智，我就再不会有好处可捞了。我的确想买BRT公司的1000股，我相信能从中获利四五个点。可是，如果他们有所猜疑，同时其他股民也大量买进的话，他们可能会直接把我拒之门外。或者我应该循序渐进，分散交易比较好。

他们的交易大厅没有杜兰公司的大，不过装潢高级些，交易的人也很明显更有钱些。这对我而言再好不过了，于是我就决定直接买BRT公司的1000股。我选好一个窗口走过去，对工作人员说：“有限额吗？我要买1000股BRT公司。”

“没有限额。”他说，“只要钱够，多少都行。”

“那就1500股。”我边说边从口袋掏钱，里面的工作人员也开始给我填成交单。

这时候，我看见一个红头发的人把那个工作人员推到了一边，凑过来说：“嗨，利文斯顿，你去杜兰吧，我们这里不让你玩。”

“我先拿了成交单吧。”我说，“我已经买了点BRT。”

“不行，不会给你的。”他说。此时，很多工作人员都在盯着我看。“别再来这儿了，我们不允许你玩，明白了没？”

不管生气还是吵闹，都不会起作用，我只好悻悻离开。回到住处，我马上结账，搭乘上了回纽约的早班车。太不顺了，我原想能赚个盆满钵满，谁知道泰勒公司一点儿机会都不给我。

回到纽约后，我把500美元还给了富勒顿，用剩下的钱开始继续我的股票生意。有时候情况好些，有时候情况坏些，可我做得还可以，也赚了些钱。毕竟，我要改的地方不算多，我也明白以前那些炒股知识根本不够用。我像一个爱玩填字游戏的人一样，总要填完所有的缺口，不然不会罢休。我想搞明白炒股的秘诀。我以为再也不会有幸到对赌行玩了，谁承想不是这样。

在纽约过了几个月，有个认识富勒顿的老头来到富勒顿公司，有人说他们以前合伙买过赛马，显然他如今过的是富有的生活。通过介绍，我与这个叫麦德威的老头认识了，他向很多人说着西部马场的骗子们不久前在圣路易斯干过一票，领头人就是对赌行老板泰勒。

“哪个泰勒？”我问。

“就那个大高个泰勒。”

“我知道那个鸟人。”我说。

“他不是好人。”麦德威说。

“不止如此，”我说，“我跟他的账还没算完呢。”

“什么意思？”

“他不讲道德，我要在他的钱包上动心思来治他。他在圣路易斯，我没法动他，但我总有机会跟他算账的。”接着我把心中的苦恼说了出来。

“哦，”老麦德威说，“以前他想在纽约做什么，但是没做成，后来在哈博肯开了个分行，据说玩法没有限制，资金雄厚得都能让直布罗陀海峡的大礁石看起来像虱子一般。”

“什么性质的地方？”我以为他说的是赌场。

“是对赌行。”麦德威说。

“你确定那里已经开张了吗？”

“当然，我的好多老伙计都提到过。”

“道听途说可不行，”我说，“你可否查探清楚呢？还有，它有没有规定买卖限额？”

“好吧，小兄弟。”麦德威说，“明天我就去查访，回来给你讲。”

麦德威送来消息说，泰勒的生意的确做得很大，放开了门在赚钱。

那天是周五，那周股价一直在涨——要知道，那是二十年前——到了周六，银行余额报表上的数字必定会猛降，股票投机分子们也必定会放手去干，给弱不禁风的信托机构好好上一课。一般会在交易临近结束前半小时出现常规的反应，尤其是那些热门的股票，而那些也正好就是泰勒的顾客们最青睐的，对赌行自然是最希望看到有人做空了。哪里还有比两头都大赚更让人兴奋的事呢，而且要做起来也不难——因为散户们交的保证金只有1个点。

周六早晨，我赶到了位于哈博肯的泰勒的对赌行。交易大厅很大，还挂着吸引人的报价牌，有很多负责交易的工作人员和穿着灰色制服的保安人员，股民大概有二十五个。

我找到经理谈了谈，他很愿意为我效劳，我不让他做任何事情，只让他知道，只有在赛马场上才能不知不觉地几分钟就赚很多钱，我根本不会对可能要等上几天的零零散散的股票交易感兴趣。听我这么说，他就赶紧劝我，让我相信炒股的安全性比较高，他们的顾客赚了很多钱——你肯定觉得他是一个最普通的股票经纪人，能为你做股票买卖的事情——他还忽悠说只要买卖做大，就会赚很多钱。他肯定觉得我就是来炒股的，非常想拉我入圈套，以便狠赚一把，他根本不想让到了嘴边的肉不翼而飞。他还说，我必须要抓住机会，周六十二点就会收盘了，搞定后下午还可以去处理其他事情，要是能选对股票，就可以赚很多的钱带到跑马场去。

我故意表现出半信半疑的神态，让他一直劝我，我瞅着挂钟，到十一点一刻时，我才答应了他。然后，我给了他几只股票的卖出委托单，投进了2000美元，他得意地收了钱，还说我一定能大赚，希望我可以经常来玩。

后续事情的发展都不出我所料，很多交易商打压股票价格，股价开始明显下降。在最后五分钟股价回升前，我把之前卖空的股票平仓，赚了5100美元，然后去兑换现金。

“能遇到这个机会真让人开心。”我把单子递给经理时说。

“唉”，他说，“你不能全部兑现，这出乎我的意料了。我周一上午会准备好钱等你来拿，保证没有问题。”

“好，但是我要先拿走你们公司手上所有的钱。”我说。

“我还得给其他散户付钱，”他说，“我今天会把你的本钱先还你，还有我付完其他单子后剩下来全部的钱。”所以我等他付钱给其他客户。噢，我知道我一定能拿到我的钱，泰勒一定不会赖账。这家公司生意很好，而且就算他赖账，我除了拿走这里所有的钱之外，还能有什么办法呢？我拿到了2800美元。我告诉他，星期一早上我还会来。他保证把钱给我。

周一那天十二点前，我到了哈博肯，有一个人正在跟那个经理聊天。泰勒赶我走的那次，我在圣路易斯见过这个人。我马上就明白了，那个经理跟他们公司总部说了这件事，这个人就被派来查看了。骗子是从来不会相信别人的。

“我过来取我赚的钱。”我对那个经理说。

“他就是那个人？”来自圣路易斯的那个家伙问。

“是。”经理边回答边拿出了一沓钱。

“先别。”那个家伙对经理喊道，然后冲我说：“利文斯顿，你忘了我们曾经说过不跟你玩吗？”

“先把钱给我。”我对经理说，他极不情愿地拿出两张1000美元、四张500美元、三张100美元的钞票。

“你说什么？”收好钱后，我才问那个人。

“我们告诉过你不让你在我们公司玩股票。”

“对啊。”我说，“我就是为这才过来的呢。”

“以后不要再来，给我滚远点。”他大吼起来。穿着灰色制服的保安听到后，故作轻松地走过来看。圣路易斯来的那人挥起拳头对经理大叫：“你早干吗去了，也不知道了解清楚，做了这么愚蠢的事情，他来诈骗你来了，他是利文斯顿，总部早就给你发过通知！”

“你听好，”我对来自圣路易斯的那人说，“这儿又不是圣路易斯，你不能耍什么花样，像你们老板对待‘贝尔法斯特小伙子’那样对待我。”

“滚蛋，这里不让你做交易。”他冲我喊。

“如果不让我做，其他人也不会来。”我对他说，“你不要耍花样骗人。”

那人听我这么说，马上改变口气。“小兄弟，”他有些惊慌失措地说，“求您了，帮帮忙，讲讲道理啊，我们不能每天遇到这样的事。要是老板知道了，会气个半死。您就发发慈悲吧，利文斯顿先生！”

“那就到此为止吧。”我做出了承诺。

“请您发发慈悲，走吧。给我们一个机会，让我们从头开始，我们才刚开业，好吗？”

“下一次我过来的时候，你们不要这样对我耍横。”说完我头也不回地走了，背后传来那人对经理的各种训斥。他们在圣路易斯对我耍横，我才这么对他们，也没必要再得理不饶人把事情搞大了。回到富勒顿公司后，我把事情讲给麦德威听。我告诉他说，如果愿意的话，请他去泰勒的对赌行玩上个20到30股，给他们留个印象；我如果有了赚大钱的机会，就给他打电话，他可以大赌一场。

我给了麦德威1000美元，他就去了哈博肯，按照我的吩咐去玩，没多长时间就成了熟客。后来有一天，我想我看出价格即将崩跌，就偷偷告诉了麦德威，他按照限额放空了股票。这一次，除去给麦德威的酬劳外，我还赚到了2800美元，而且，说不定麦德威还自己偷偷加了一些钱去赌呢。没过一个月，泰勒设在哈博肯的分行就倒闭了。警察开始忙起来了。总而言之，虽然我只交易过两次，但这家公司并没有收回成本。猛烈的牛市来了，股价跌落的点数特别小，也就1个点，股民们不会被轻易洗掉，所有人都在做多头，赚了很多钱。全国大量的对赌行只能纷纷关闭。

游戏已经发生了变化。在传统的对赌行里玩股票，比在有名的股票经纪人办公室玩股票容易赚钱得多。例如，你的保证金亏损后账户会被自动清理掉，这就能防止继续遭受损失。在股票交易所里，当有的股票走势不利于你的时候，你不能立马做出反应，就会损失惨重。在纽约，对赌行对待股民很严苛，根本没有我在西部时所听闻的那样大方。他们经常会把受关注度比较高的股票盈利点限定在2个点以内，比如糖业公司和田纳西煤铁公司的股票，就算这些股票几分钟涨了10个点，你一张成交单只能赚2个点。他们认为，如果不这样，股民会赚太多钱，股民亏了1个点就可能赚到10个点。有那么一段时间，包括最大的对赌行在内的所有交易场所，都拒绝股民购买某些股票。在1900年大选的前一天，人们都觉得麦金莱当选总统已成定局，所以纽约的所有对赌行都暂停了股票交易。麦金莱被人们以三比一的概率看好，如果周一买了股票，你就会多赚3到6个点，还可能更多。你可以买进股票赌麦金莱，保证会赚钱，可是那一天对赌行全天拒绝交易。

如果不是他们不让我在对赌行玩，我就会一直在对赌行这么玩下去，也就意味着我只能瞅准那点上下小跳的行情，赚个蝇头小利，根本不可能学到更多的炒股技巧了。





第三章


于人而言，吃一堑长一智需要花费大量时间。谁都知道事物具有两面性，可股市却始终只有一面。不是多头的一面，也不是空头的一面，而是正确的一面。真正记住这条通则所花费的时间，远远超过股票投机游戏中很多技术层次的东西。

据说有人能模拟操作股市，证明自己有多厉害。这些玄幻的赌徒有时的确能赚很多钱，这样很容易让人成为大赌特赌的赌徒，就像老故事里说的那样，某人第二天要与人决斗。

助手问他：“你能行吗？”

决斗的人说：“当然，我能在二十步之外射中酒杯脚。”他还一副很谦虚的样子。

“厉害啊。”助手没任何反应，“可酒杯上若有个手枪对着你的心脏，而且已经上膛了，你还能行吗？”

我觉得，必须要拥有实际赚到的钱才能证明自己的观点正确。我过去栽的跟头让我明白：只有百分百坚信不会后退，才可以开始前进。如果不能前进，那就蛰伏待动。我的意思并非说人犯错了不要去止损。他就该那样做，不过最好不要把自己培养成优柔寡断的人。我这辈子总在犯错，不过我会吸取教训，也总结了一些很实用的经验。有那么几次，我的亏损很大，但是我的亏损从来都不是彻底的亏损。不然的话，我现在也就不是我了。我总是相信自己还有机会，我不会在同一条道上摔两次。我相信自己。

如果谁要靠这种游戏过活的话，就必须要自信，只有自信才不至于盲目相信各种乱七八糟的内幕消息。如果按照史密斯的内幕消息去买进卖出，那他就成了我的心理依靠，他一旦外出度假，又恰逢交易的好机会来了，那该怎么办？不能这样啊，先生，可不能靠别人教我们怎么去赚钱。以我的经验来看，只有靠自己的判断才能赚更多钱，不管谁提供的消息都比不上这个，我用五年时间才学会了怎么聪明地玩这个游戏，足以让我在自己正确时赚大钱。

我身上没有多少你认为的那种有趣经历。我的意思是，学习怎么样去投机股票，这个历程没有什么趣味性。我有好多令人不爽的失败经历，跟华尔街上的那些人一模一样。投机是一件非常耗人的艰难事情，玩的人一定要紧盯着不能松懈，不然的话随时都可能会失业。

本来，我要做的事情也不难，在受到富勒顿公司的打击后我就应该知道了：换个角度去看待投机。但我没有很快认识到，其实很多东西在对赌行都没办法学到。我觉得在投机过程中已经能手到擒来了，其实只不过是在对赌行有点小小战绩而已。而在对赌行的那些日子的确让我的分析判断能力有所提升，尤其是训练了记忆力。这两点我学得很好。身为交易人士，我起先的那些成功经历都源于这两点，而并不是我有多么聪明或者多么博学，我没受过头脑训练，是很无知的。在玩这个游戏的过程中我学会了操作，而且这个游戏也在教导我的同时很冷血地鞭打我。

直到现在我都记得初到纽约那天的情形。我提到过对赌行不跟我做生意，所以我只能去找名号响亮的经纪人。我原来有个同事在纽交所会员企业哈丁兄弟公司工作，我早上到纽约后，中午一点前就在那家公司开好了股票账户，准备交易。

我没有跟你解释过。我是多么自然而然地就玩起对赌行那一套，瞅准股价走势，伺机捕捉一小段一定会出现的价格变化。没人对我说这与原来有何不同，要是有人告诉我这样是不行的，那我也一定会去验证一番。只有赔钱才让我相信我错了，只要能赚钱就是正确之道。这就是投机的实质。

那段时日，股市活跃，股民们轻松快活，很让人兴奋，我一下子就如鱼得水。熟悉的股市行情公告就在我的眼前，大家谈的话我15岁以前就学会了。有个男孩干着我刚开始做事时干的那些活，股民们一动不动地看着股市行情公告牌，大喊着股价数字，讨论着行情。机器跟我熟悉的机器显然完全一样。空气和我在伯灵顿赚到第一笔钱（就是那3.12美元）以来所呼吸的空气一样。行情还是那样的行情，股民还是那种股民，游戏也还是那个游戏。不要忘记，这时候我才22岁，我觉得自己已经完全掌握了这个游戏规则，难道不是这样吗？

我专心观察着股市行情公告牌，看准了想买的股票，它的形势不错，84美元，我买了100股，没到半个小时，我就以85美元抛掉。紧接着，我又瞅准了另一只股票，然后用相同手法行事，在很短的时间里净赚3/4个点。初试身手就旗开得胜，不是吗？

请注意，在这家名气很响的地方，光在头一天只花了两个小时，我就买卖了1100股，抢进抢出。但是那天的结果是，我赔掉了1100美元，意思是我在纽交所第一次出手就损失了一半资金。请记住，有赚钱的时候，但最后赔掉了1100美元。

我没有在意，因为我根本不知道哪里出错了。我的每一步都稳稳当当，如果在之前的对赌行，肯定是稳赚不赔的。失去的那1100美元很清楚地告诉我，机器没有以正常的方式对待我，可只要机器操作人员没有问题，就没什么可担心的。22岁年轻人的懵懂不是什么大弱点。

过了几天，我告诉自己：“在这里这样交易可不行，这里出来的信息没有多大的参考价值。”不过这也就是一闪念的事，我没深想，继续按照老路子玩，有赚有赔，一直赔到一文不剩，我就去跟老富勒顿借了500美元。后来我带着从对赌行赚到的那些钱，再次由圣路易斯跑到纽约。

我学得更加谨慎，有一阵子还玩得比较顺手。手头一宽裕，我就尽力让生活惬意点。我认识了一些新朋友，日子过得还不错。不要忘记，我才不到23岁，一个人能闯荡纽约，口袋里也有挣来的钱，我心中坚信我已经开始了解新的股价机器了。

我开始考虑我的单子下到证券交易所大厅后实际的执行情况，行动变得特别谨慎，不过我还是相信来自纸上的那些信息，没有在意普遍性的规则。我一直不转变方式，就看不出自己操作上的真正问题。

1901年，经济开始进入大增长时期，我挣了很多钱——对一个年轻人来说——是很多钱。你还记得那些日子吗？国家经济繁荣，工业兼并和资本重组来势汹汹，股市被疯狂地托举起来。我听说以前日子红火时，华尔街号称日成交量达到了25万股，一天能倒腾2500万美元的股票。到1901年，股民们制造了日成交量300万股的创世纪录，每个人都在赚钱。那些挥金如土的钢铁巨头也进来了，都是些百万富翁，能让他们感到满意的游戏就是闯荡股市。我们曾遇到过这样的大人物：约翰·盖茨和他的一群朋友，他们常挂在嘴边的一句话就是“赌个100万”，比如约翰·德里克、罗伊尔·史密斯这些里德-利兹-摩尔集团的人，他们把钢铁公司的股份卖掉，然后在股市把罗德岛系统的一大半股份买进手里。还有施瓦布、弗里克、菲甫斯和匹斯堡集团，更别提很多很多在这场金钱易主的游戏中亏了本，但在其他行当里都被奉为大作手的人了。你可以买卖所有的股票。凯恩炒热了美国钢铁公司的股票。一个经纪人几分钟就能卖掉10万股，多美好的时代啊，多令人艳羡的巨头啊，而且人们不用为卖掉股票纳税，简直就是一派没有终点的祥和气氛。

没多久，我听到了熊市要来的流言。老手们都说，除了他们，其他人都是疯子。可事实却是除了他们外，其他人都赚到了钱。我自然知道，牛市总有到头的时候，见股票就收入囊中的疯劲儿也有终止的一天——我做好了面对熊市的心理准备。可我每次卖出后都在亏，如果不是我出手快，可能会赔更多。我梦想着股市暴跌，但我也小心翼翼地操作。我买进的股票赚了钱，抛掉的又赔本了，一直没赚什么大钱，虽然你们会因为我出手豪爽而觉得我赚了不少。

有一只股票我一直没放空，就是北太平洋铁路的股票。我以往具有的那些能力有了用武之地，通过分析后我觉得大多数股票都已经被人买到久盘不动了，而北太平洋的走势却很好，可能还会上涨。我们现在都清楚，当时不管是普通股还是优先股，都被库恩-罗布-哈里曼集团收入囊中。我手里握着北太平洋1000普通股，没有被其他人的意见左右，一直牢牢抓住不放。当它涨到110美元的时候，已经上涨了30个点，我立马伺机卖掉，赚了将近5万美元，这是那时候我赚得最多的一笔钱。对于几个月前在同一个地方还赔得吐血的人来说，这种成绩就算非常难得了。

你可能记得，哈里曼集团那时候通知摩根集团和希尔集团说，他们要取代摩根在北太平洋铁路公司的地位，然后摩根集团事先让操盘的凯恩买进5万股北太平洋，设法保住他们对公司的控股权。据说，凯恩让银行家罗伯特·培根做好了买15万股的准备，罗伯特照办了。总之，凯恩派了他的经纪人艾迪·诺顿去买北太平洋的10万股。我觉得，他们接下来又买了5万股，然后演变成一场著名的收购大战。1901年5月8日闭市后，谁都知道有两家金融巨鳄的战争正在持续。这个国家从未出现过规模如此庞大的巨头资本之战，哈里曼对战摩根，真正的棋逢对手啊。

5月9日早上，我拿着5万美元现金，没有一只股票。我说过，我做好了迎接熊市的准备，现在机会来了。我知道接下来要发生的事情：从暴跌开始，接着很多价格低廉的股票充斥股市，用不了多久又马上反弹，然后那些低价买进的股民们就会大赚。这都不用他福尔摩斯来推理我也能判断出这一点。我们即将有机会在股价一涨一跌之间稳稳当当地获取巨大利润。

所有事情都在我的预料之中，可是我却赔尽了钱。我没有料到会有一些意外出现。如果人们不遇到突发事件，大家就不会有什么差别，生活该是多么无趣，炒股也就只是乏味的增减，而股民也只是思维僵化的记账员而已。恰恰就是预测让人脑洞大开。你只要想想要猜得正确你必须做什么，就知道这一点。

就像我预测的那样，股市又变得疯狂了，巨额的成交量，变幻无常的股价。我下了一大堆卖单。我看到想做的股票开盘价不是太好，心里一阵兴奋。经纪人为我忙着，他们与其他经纪人一样兢兢业业，可等到他们执行我的单子时，价格已经跌了20多个点。成交量太大了，报价纸带上的数字远远落在市况之后。当我按报价纸带显示的股价，比如100美元，下单卖出股票时，经纪人却以80美元替我卖掉，比前一天的收盘价还低三四十美元，这好像是我花钱让股价跌落到我想买的低价了。不过股价不会一直这样下跌，所以我马上决定平了空头，掉转方向做多头。

经纪人按照交易所接到单子时候的那个股价买进股票，并不能按照能让我有利可图的那个股价买，而是他们的场内人员拿到我的委托单时，证券交易所的市价。他们付出的价格比我预估的高出15点，谁能受得了一天之内就损失35点呢。

我被滞后的信息完全损伤了，根据报价机信息判断行情的习惯耍了我，纸上显示的股价和真实的股价不符让我遭受了大损失。我被曾经让我失败过的东西再次打倒。如此看来，光靠那些滞后的信息，而不顾经纪人是怎么操作的会吃大亏。我特别吃惊，为什么早没有搞明白这点而找到应对措施呢。

我的行为比看不出来还糟糕，我继续交易，继续抢进抢出，也没考虑经纪人的操作规律。你知道，我没做过限价交易，我要抓住机会，打败股市而不是股价。我一旦觉得可以卖就赶紧卖掉，觉得股价会涨就赶紧买进，坚守投机的这一条通则挽救了我。在对赌行里的那一套——简单地玩限价交易——在股票交易所里也可以使用。倘若不是吃了亏，我就学不到实打实的投机玩法，只能按照粗浅的经验一直冒险。

为了减少纸带机滞后于股市的不利影响，我每次都尝试玩限价买卖，但股市一直飞速变化，我只好放弃这样的做法。我都不知道为什么会有这样的改变，耗了那么多年，我才知道不能赌随后几档的小小起伏，而应该赌预期即将出现的大波动。

5月9日赔了以后，我就改变了做法，不过还是有漏洞。要不是偶尔会赚点钱，我可能会更快地学到市场中的智慧。但我赚到的钱也够我舒服地生活，开心地享受生活。那年夏天，我跟其他富裕发达的华尔街人一样，到新泽西海滨去避暑，只是赚的钱不足以支撑我的亏损和生活开销。

我继续那样交易，不是因为我顽固不化，而是我不知道问题出在哪里，更别说如何解决了。我不厌其烦地说这些，只是想让你知道，天将降大任于我，必会先让我吃些苦。在对付大型动物时，我的那杆老猎枪与高超的来复枪相比，劣势太明显了。

这年秋天，我一方面输掉了全部的资金，另一方面对屡败屡战的炒股游戏也产生了厌倦，我做出了离开纽约的决定，想换个地方换个方向玩。我从14岁开始玩股票，15岁赚到第一个1000美元，21岁赚到第一个1万美元。我很多次赚了上万美元又亏掉了。我在纽约赚过几千、几万美元，又把这些钱亏掉了。我最多赚过5万美元，两天后，又赔得血本无归。我没有其他的生意，也不知道别的游戏。几年以后，我被打回原点。更不幸的是，我变得花钱如流水一般，虽然这没有赔钱那样令我不舒服。





第四章


好吧，我回家了。但是从回来那一刻开始，我忽然觉得，凑集些资本再转战华尔街，这才是我生活的目标。在整个美国，只有华尔街才是我唯一能玩大钱的地方。未来某一天，我找到那种感觉，并且凑够了钱，就会需要在华尔街那样的地方找存在感。当人状态比较好的时候，就会对那些有利条件充满渴望。

虽然希望不大，但是我对对赌行还是寄予厚望。这时候，城市里已经很少有对赌行了，有几家我还不熟悉。有些对赌行还记得我，不让我大显身手，虽然我跟他们解释说，我在纽约赔光了所有的钱，我并没有原来所想的那样清楚股市，让我玩一玩对他们没有什么损害，但他们就是不同意。而新开的那些地方又不可靠，新老板们都觉得，要是一个客户有理由认定自己会猜对，顶多只应该买卖20股。

我很缺钱，规模大些的对赌行能从客户手里收集足够多的资金，所以我找朋友跟我搭伙玩。我自己只偶尔进去瞧瞧，然后悄然撤退。有一次，我心痒难耐，劝说工作人员允许我玩一把，哪怕就50股。他当然拒绝了我。我和朋友提前编好了交流的暗号，以便于我指导他怎么玩。这种办法虽然一时管用，可于我来说太小打小闹。没多长时间，这个对赌行的人在接到我朋友的单子时开始抱怨。终于有那么一天，我朋友准备卖掉圣保罗的100股时，他们拒绝了他。

后来我们才明白是怎么回事。有人看到我们在外面说话，就去对赌行告了密。当我朋友拿单子要卖出圣保罗的100股时，对方就拉着脸说：“我们不接受任何圣保罗的卖单，尤其是你的单子。”

“为什么呀，乔？”朋友问。

“不接就是不接，就这么简单。”乔回答说。

“这些钱难道不是钱吗？你看清楚，全都在这里。”朋友拿出100美元递给他——我的100美元——一共10张10美元的。乔恼羞成怒地盯着他，我在旁边偷偷瞧着，像每一次看客户与对赌行吵架一样。其他股友们都围拢了过去，围在两个争吵的人身边。有人大声说话，或者对赌行和顾客之间，有任何争吵的迹象时，他们都会这样。他们喜欢凑热闹当看客，以便了解对赌行的实力。

乔是对赌行的经理助理，他从柜台后走出来，走到我朋友面前，看着他，然后又看看我。

“真好笑，”他慢条斯理地说，“太好笑了！你朋友利文斯顿没来时，你没事可干，光盯着公告牌看，一看就是几个小时，一句话都不说。可是他来了后，你就忙活得停不下了。你可能是在为你自己玩，但是这里以后就是不让你交易了。我们的交易规则还是跟原来一样，我们不上利文斯顿替你通风报信的当。”

唉，这简直就是要逼死我啊。幸好我挣来的那点钱比花掉的多几百美元。我就想着怎么花钱才能物超所值，要去纽约是件很紧迫的事情。我想，下一次自己一定会做得更好。花时间对曾经的愚蠢行为进行反省后，我慢慢明白，首要目标是进行下一次的冒险行动。你看，当一个人站得远一些，他就能更清楚地看清事实。

有一天，我和朋友们在一家旅馆大堂聊天。这些人都是稳稳当当的股民，我们一起聊着股市。我说：“以我的经验来看，经纪人执行方法拙劣，不可能有人赚钱，特别是像我这样，用市价交易的时候。”

有个人扯着大嗓门问，我话里说的经纪人是谁。

“全美国最好的经纪人。”我这样回答。他就继续问最好的经纪人又是谁。我知道他一点儿都不相信我曾经在最牛的公司里炒过股。

我说：“就是纽交所的那些经纪人。并非他们不实在或者不细心，是你在那里填单子的时候，没办法知悉股票的实际股价，直到经纪人把成交回报单给你以后才可以。股票波动个一两点的次数，总比波动十几点的次数多，可股民受限于成交的条件，抓不住那点小波动来赚钱。如果对赌行里不设限制可以大玩，我都想天天泡在那里。”

跟我对话的人叫罗伯茨，我以前从来没见过他。他好像很乐意帮我。他把我拉到旁边，问我是不是在其他地方玩过，我否认了。他说他知道一些棉花和其他农产品的交易所，还有些规模小点的交易所会员公司。这些地方非常小心在意，特别注重经纪人完成任务的质量，与纽交所那样的大机构的关系非常好。靠这些影响力和每个月几十万股的稳定生意，他们能为散户股民们提供更好的服务。

“他们真的能满足散户们的需求。”他说着，“而且，他们的特长就是做外地业务。不管10股还是10万股他们都一视同仁。那里的工作人员特别热情能干，值得信任。”

“好吧。可如果他们要向纽交所付1/8点佣金，那还赚什么钱呢？”

“嗯，他们付的应该是1/8点的佣金。不过……你懂的。”他朝我挤眉弄眼。

“是啊。”我说，“但是他们不退佣金，这不公平。证券交易所主管宁可让会员犯谋杀、纵火和重婚罪，也不愿意他们在和外地人做生意时，收取比1/8点佣金还低的费用。证券交易所能不能生存，靠的就是这个规则。”

他可能确定了我曾经在交易所与人交过手，就继续说：“你听我说，也有违反规则被罚停一年交易的证券交易所会员公司，是吧？退佣金的方法太多太多了，没人会告发的。”见我一脸疑惑，他又说，“另外，有特殊服务的时候，我们……我的意思是，那些有自己的通信办法的公司会在1/8点佣金之上加收1/32点。这很公平，除非出现特殊情况，比如有人的账户不怎么有动静，不然是不会额外收钱的。你懂的，不然他们就赔了。他们做生意可不是完全为了自己的健康着想。”

我终于明白，他是为一些冒牌经纪人拉活呢。

“你可以介绍个可靠点的公司吗？”我问。

“我知道全美国最大的经纪公司。”他答道，“我自己就在那里玩过，他们有78个分公司遍布美国和加拿大，生意特别好。如果不可靠，他们怎么可能年复一年做得那么好呢，是不是？”

“这倒是。”我附和说，“他们和纽交所做的一样吗？”

“一样，他们那里有交易市场和欧美交易所上市的所有股票，涉及小麦、棉花和其他农产品。任何你想做的，他们都做。世界各地都有他们的代理。他们是所有交易所的会员，不是用自己的名字参加的会员，就是秘密会员。”

我已经了如指掌了，但我仍然想多套出些内情。

“是啊。”我说，“可是即便这样，那些指令还是需要别人去执行，世界上没有谁能保证市况会怎么变化，报出的股价和报价机上显示的股价有多接近。股民们等在那儿得到消息，递上单子，再打电报到纽约，已经浪费了很多宝贵时间。我还是去纽约更好些，我宁可把钱输在一家可靠的公司里。”

“我不懂输钱，我们的股民没有这种习惯。他们负责赚钱，我们负责照顾生意。”

“你们的股民？”

“哦，我在这家公司有些股份，我如果能招揽生意进去的话，也是乐意去做的。他们对我还可以，帮助我赚了些钱。你要同意的话，我介绍你认识他们。”

“这家公司名叫什么？”我问。

他说了名字，我也听说过，这家公司在很多报纸上做过广告，宣传他们能通过内部消息帮别人炒股发财，这是他们的突出特点。这家公司不是通常所说的那种对赌行，而是个坑骗股民的地方。他们伪装得很好，总能让人相信他们是合法正规的普通公司。其实，这样的公司存在很久了。

在那个时代，他们是以卖空买空为职业的人，就是如今被吊销了执照的经纪人，他们的诈骗原则和形式都没有发生变化，只是路数上有了变化，那些谁都知晓的邪恶手段改了个形式。

这类人会经常放出些内幕消息，忽悠股民们买卖股票。他们发出大量电报建议人们买进某一只股票，同时又发出很多电报给另一部分人卖出这只股票，就像那些传统的赌马顾问一样。接着，买卖双方的交易单就会大量涌入，公司再利用一家名气好的交易所会员机构买进和卖出1000股这只股票，所谓的规范经营记录也就产生了，要是哪个家伙不礼貌，怀疑他们在客户的单子上做手脚的话，这就是他们用来反驳质疑者的凭证。

这类公司也发行自己经营的交易基金，以自认为最妥帖的形式，让参与者以书面形式把姓名和资金使用权授予他们。所以，当客户们的钱不翼而飞时，就算最暴躁的客户也没办法找到让他们合法赔偿的证据。他们会在账面上做多一只股票，然后忽悠股民们跟进，再耍个卖空的手段，骗掉几百个客户的保证金。他们谁都不放过，就连女人、教师和老人都是他们的忽悠对象。

“我讨厌所有的经纪人。”我对这个推销员说，“让我考虑一下。”随后我赶紧离开，以免他再跟我多说话。

我调查这家违规对赌行后发现，他们的客户有好几百人，虽然名声有些不好，可是我还没听说他们拒绝支付哪怕一个客户赚到的钱，本身要找到一个在那家公司赚了钱的客户就不容易，不过我还是赢钱了。当时总的来看，股市行情好像有利于他们，所以若一次交易有了损失，他们不会对客户耍赖。只是大多数这样的公司最后都倒闭了。美国出现过好多次这类公司的倒闭潮，就像传染病一样，一批批对赌行接二连三地倒闭了。没倒闭的对赌行，客户们也像惊弓之鸟，忙着把钱从里面抽出来。不过，在这个国家仍然有一些暂时停手的对赌行老板在卧薪尝胆，随时准备出击。

那个人介绍的这家公司一直在挣钱，不时会有些诈骗事件发生，此外也没什么令人惊讶的消息。他们最擅长的就是忽悠那些想一口气吃成胖子的笨蛋，让他们在感觉不对时没办法用法律来自我保护。

有个小伙子对我讲了他亲眼所见的一出戏。有一天，有家对赌行发出了600份电报，让客户们买进一只股票，同时又发出另外600份电报，忽悠另外一群客户出售这只股票。

“对，我清楚这种手段。”我对他说。

“不错。”他说，“第二天，他们又给那些客户发了电报，让他们平仓，去买卖另一只股票。我就问他们的一个高级合伙人，这样做的原因是什么。我明白他们前一部分的做法，是利用客户觉得会赚钱的心理，虽然最后他们都会亏损。可是你们发出这样的电报不就等于是把他们全部杀掉吗？这么做是为什么？”

“哦。”那个合伙人说，“不管他们怎么买卖，跟谁买卖，什么时候买卖，在哪里买卖，反正这些客户都铁定要赔钱。一旦客户亏了钱，我就会失掉这些客户，我不如趁机从他们身上大捞一笔，之后再去找其他客户。”

说实话，我对这些公司的商业道德丝毫不感兴趣。我提到过，泰勒公司欺负我，让我反感并决心去报复他们。可是这家公司，并没有让我产生那种感觉。他们是骗子没错，可也不见得有传说的那样可恶。我根本不想让他们替我做任何交易，不想遵照他们的内幕消息进行操作，也不会相信他们的鬼话。我只想赶紧赚钱去纽约，找一家名正言顺的公司做大生意，不用为警察忽然查访而提心吊胆，不用担心检察官们会冻结资金什么的。

不管怎样，我打定主意要去探访这家对赌行，看他们到底有哪些比正规公司更诱人的条件。因为没多少钱，这样的公司又比较随便些，我就可以用几百美元去试水，一探究竟。

我来到这家公司后，找到了经理。他知道我是个老手，曾经在纽约交易所会员公司开过户，而且把带去的钱全部亏光之后，就理所当然觉得我是个只会赔本的顽固分子，是经纪商稳定的衣食父母——不管他们是在你单子上作假的经纪商，还是乐于只赚手续费的经纪商。

我对这个经理说，我想找的是执行力最强的公司，我一直在市场中玩，不想看到那种比实际股价滞后1个点的情形。

他向我保证说，任何我认为正确的事情，他们都愿意做。他说他们想接我的生意，是因为他们想让我见识一下什么叫一流的公司。他们拥有很精明的工作人员，能以最快的速度完成操作，他们是靠这个出了名的。如果出现股价滞后的情况，他们不承诺一定精确到位，但会选择有利于客户的那个价格，我如果在这里开了户，马上就可以电报交易。很明显，他们对自家工作人员的执行水平很自信，如此一来，我完全可以当作是在正规对赌行玩一样。他们的意思是，希望我从下一轮就开始交易，我不想表现得太急切，所以拒绝了，说可能现在还不行。他就急切地忽悠我不要失去机会，要抓紧时间马上开始。

在他们眼里，确实该这样。股市只要有轻微波动的时候，就是鼓动股民们去交易的时机，再在股市不稳定的时候榨掉他们身上的钱，把他们套牢。

我只是留了姓名和地址。不过，从那天起，我就开始收到相关的电报和信件，劝我买某只股票，还说有一家大机构会把这只股票炒高50点。

我忙碌起来了，开始寻找类似的其他公司。要想不受这一家的桎梏，多赚些钱，就需要多方下手，在邻近的几家公司一起玩。

清楚行情后，我在三家公司开了户，还租了一个小办公室，安上了电报机，以便直接与他们联系。

我小心翼翼地行事，为了不吓着他们，我把钱平均了一下投了进去。刚起步，我就赚到了钱，不过他们还是劝我做大一些，胆小鬼是不怎么受待见的。他们以为我做得越大就会赔得越多，输个精光也是指日可待，这样他们也就赚得越多。这种理论是有道理的——要是你想到他们打交道的都是一般散户，而一般散户在财务方面，从来都无法长久生存下去。破产的客户没钱了就没办法交易，但半死不活的客户会抱怨、不满，制造一些伤害业务的事故。

我还联系了一家公司，他们可以直接用电报联系上纽约的代理人，这个代理人还是纽交所的会员。我买了一台自动收报机，谨慎地开始操作。我提到过，这很像是在对赌行里交易，只是稍微慢点。

在这样的游戏中，我可以赚钱，也的确赚了钱。我还没修炼到投进去多少就赚取多少的境界，但是我基本上都在赚钱，周复一周地赚钱。我又有了生活舒适的资本了，还为去华尔街大干一番存了些钱。我还选择了另外两家经纪商，加起来就有了五家——当然了，他们都是我来钱的源头。

我的计划也有失败的时候，选择的股票走势跟我的预期发展完全不一样。不过这对我没造成什么损伤，因为我的保证金不多。我与经纪人关系处理得也还不错，他们的账目和记录常常跟我的不同，自然是想坑我。这是多巧的事情——人为制造的巧合。每次遇到这类情况，我都会竭尽全力维护自己的利益，基本上都是以我获胜结束。他们也拼着命想从我手中捞走我捞来的钱，可能他们觉得我赚的钱只是暂时性的贷款。

他们真的不正派，因为他们靠耍花招或设骗局赚钱，对经纪商应该赚取的利润不满意。一味地想着发大财的人总会赔本——他们从来不慎重，你或许觉得他们在合法地做非法生意。其实不是这样。“把客户当上帝才能赚钱。”这是经得起推敲的古训，可是他们却视而不见，就想着靠欺骗换钱。

好几次他们都想耍老手段请我入瓮。我只要一不留神，就会掉入瓮中。他们总是在我的交易金额比正常少的时候，设法坑害我。我指责他们欺诈，他们当然不会承认，然后一切又照旧进行。与骗子交往，有个好处是，只要你能一直和他们保持交易，他们就会原谅你抓到他们的小辫子，这对于他们想赚钱的目的来说，都是小事一桩，他们乐于尽可能地包容你。真是好大方的一群东西啊！

对他们的鬼把戏忍受够了以后，我就准备采取反制。首先，我选择了一些炒得已经失去兴头的冷门股，如果我直接用垃圾股来玩，他们可能会对我产生怀疑。其次，我告诉五个经纪人要买入这只股票。他们收到我发的单子后，等着下一轮的股价行情，我就在熟悉的一家交易所里，让他们为我马上卖掉100股那只股票。你能想象得出，当卖单出现的时候，人们会怎么样想：一家和外地有关系的经纪商竟然这么急着想卖出冷门股票，肯定是有人手里有廉价股。我给出的股价会出现在报价单上，我耐心等着低价买进400股这只股票。那几家公司很疑虑，问我知道了什么消息，我只告诉他们我知道点内幕消息。闭市之前，我又让那家交易所赶紧为我买回来100股，反正我不想做这100股空头，也不管它价格多高，这立马抬高了股价。与此同时，我要赶紧抛售400股，他们就给纽约发电报立刻照办。这样的话，我就达到了要给那些跟着炒作500股的经纪人一点儿颜色的目的。这是个令人满意的买卖过程。

他们没有亡羊补牢，所以我惩罚了他们好几次，但其实这离他们应得的惩罚还远呢，100股对于推动股价显得太少，很少能超过1个点，不过我却能为以后去华尔街做投资积攒一点儿钱。有时候我会改变一下，卖空一些股票，但是从来没做得过于张扬。我很满意每次尝试都净赚600或800美元。

有一天，我怎么也没料到，我的绝妙技巧居然拉动了十几个点的波动。我不是有意做成这样的，只是我恰好在一家经纪商那里操作200股，而不是像平常一样操作100股。不过，我在其他几家还是做了100股，可对他们的教训已经不小了。他们像受训狗一样痛苦不堪，怨恨说股市被人操控了。所以我去找那个劝我开户的经理的时候，他气愤地说：“有人在操纵股市，我不会给你付钱的。”他之前每次耍花招被我发现的时候，都假装宽宏大量的样子。以他的职位来说，他当时说的话的确是大言不惭。

“我把单子给你的时候，并没有人操控，我能在你这里买进，就必须要卖出，这就是公平，你不能耍赖啊，清楚吗？”

他嚷道：“是，我就耍赖，我知道有人在捣乱。”

“谁？”

“有人。”

“那他们想捣谁的乱？”

他说：“你的朋友肯定知情。”

不过我告诉他：“你们都清楚，我是独来独往的，这个城市里每个人都知道这点，从一开始他们就知道。现在我客客气气地对你讲，快给我钱，我不想发脾气，快点。”

他吼道：“一毛钱都没有，这笔交易有人作弊。”

我烦躁得要命，正告他：“你立即把钱付我。”

嚯，他表现得更厉害了，骂我是个大骗子，但最终还是给我付了钱。其他公司的人都没这么暴躁。一家公司的经理在办公室研究了我操控冷门股票的那套玩法，他接到我的单子时，自己也跟着买了些，有清清楚楚的记录，他也赚了些钱。这些人不会害怕人们告他们欺诈，他们一直准备着各种说辞。可他们害怕我会把他们生财的物件给查封了，至于在银行的钱，他们不会害怕，因为他们不会让钱暴露在这种危险当中。说他们很精明是不会为他们带来损失的，但是说他们赖账就不一样了，这不是好名声。客户们在经纪人手里赔钱不是什么稀罕事，可如果拿不到赚的钱，那可是这一行最大的忌讳。

我拿到了钱，不过这次操纵10个上涨点的事情，结束了我骗那些骗子的美好时光。他们密切注意寻找他们用来欺骗几百个可怜客户的小花招。我又像以前一样玩，但市场并不是始终配合我的系统，我也不是一直很顺利——我的意思是我受到下单金额的限制，没办法赚大钱。

做了一年多，我使尽了这个行当里的各种解数，赚了钱，日子过得也还不错，还买了一辆车，只是钱还是不够用。我需要赚钱，也需要生活。即使炒股一切顺利，我也要节约些，不能大手大脚；如果不太顺利，自然没钱花了。我节省下来了一笔钱，觉得在这五家对赌行是没机会赚大钱的，所以就决定回纽约去。

我开着车，和一个做汽车生意的朋友，一起踏上了去纽约的路。在纽黑文停下吃饭时，我们碰到了一个做过生意的老交情，聊天时他说城里还有家生意很好的对赌行。

在驶离旅店去纽约的路上，我们看到了那家对赌行，光从外面瞅瞅是没办法消除心痒的，于是我们下车进去看。里面不是很阔绰，但是熟悉的看板，还有客户都在那里，而且股票游戏正在进行。

经理像是当过演员或者正在发表竞选演说，他的话动人心弦。他对大家说早安的样子，就好像他用显微镜花了十年的时间去找早晨，发现了早晨的好处，并且把这个发现跟蓝天、晨光和公司的资金，当成礼物献给你。他看我们开着很华丽的车，就觉得我们既年轻又显得无所事事——我估计我看起来才20岁——可能是耶鲁大学的学生。我们没告诉他我们真正的来历，他也没给我们说话的机会，就开始一番演说。他说很高兴见到我们，问我们能否找个位置坐下来，还说上午的这次交易是慈善活动，是为了给大学生们赚个零花钱的机会，而有史以来，聪明的大学生零花钱从来就没够用过。既然已经到了这里，就借机投入一点儿钱，会让你获得很高的收入。股市上能赚到任何人所能花费的零用钱。

呃，对赌行的经理这么急着让我们玩，不玩一把多可惜啊。所以，我就对他说要玩一下，因为我听说很多人都炒股赚了大钱。

一开始我只是小玩了一把，赢到钱后，就加大了些投入，我朋友也一起跟着玩。

我们在纽黑文住了一晚，第二天上午十点零五分，我又到了这家诱人的对赌行，经理很高兴再次看到我们，他觉得我们会好运连连。我赚了将近1500美元。又隔一天上午，我们进去看到那位伟大的演讲家后，我给了他一张卖出500股的单子，他犹豫不决，不过还是照办了。股价下跌超过1个点，我结束了交易，赚了500美元，加上500美元的保证金，他从钱柜里拿了1000美元，20张50美元的钞票，翻来覆去数了好几遍，又在我眼前一张张数一番，就像有汗粘住了钱一样，但是他终于还是把钱给了我。他站在我后面，双臂抱在一起，咬着嘴唇盯着我身后的一扇窗户上面看。

我说我要卖出200股钢铁公司的股票，他装作没听见，我又改口说300股，他才回过神来，只是望着我，然后吧唧着嘴咽了咽口水，一副要指摘腐败体制的模样。临了，他用手指着我手里的钞票说：“带着些玩意儿走吧。”

我问：“什么玩意儿？”我没搞懂他指的什么。

他生气了：“大学生，你们要去哪里？”

我说：“纽约。”

他絮絮叨叨地说：“很好，很好，你们必须走，今天我算认识了两个家伙——学生！我知道你们不是，你们是什么我清楚了。哼！哼！哼！”

我礼貌地说：“就这样吗？”

他稍顿一下后说：“就这样，你们——”说着他失去了在大厅里原有的理智，气愤地叫道，“你们两个是全美国最大的骗子！学生？一年级学生吧！哼！”

我们离开自言自语的他。他也许在乎的不是钱，所有把这种事当职业的人都不会在乎钱，有赚有赔在所难免，只是他受到了我们的耍弄，自尊心受到了伤害。

我就这样第三次来到了华尔街，其实我一直在研究我的炒股方法，试图找出真正的问题，找出让我在富勒顿公司功败垂成的原因。

20岁时，我第一次玩1万美元并且赔掉了，可我知道是为什么——因为我没抓好机会，没利用好经验和钻研出的方法，纯粹靠赌博。我想要赚钱，可是却不知道应该在适宜的时候来赚钱。22岁的时候，我已经凑够了5万美元，却在5月9日的时候赔了个精光，我也知道这是为什么——原因是股市行情记录滞后，还出现了幅度很大的波动。可是自打从圣路易斯回到纽约，经历了5月9日的恐慌事件后，我仍然没有搞懂输钱的真正原因。我有一些理论，能够起到些亡羊补牢的作用，但是我需要实际操作。

世界上没有什么比让你失去一切更能教会你什么是不该做的了，一旦你知道了不该做什么才能不亏钱时，你也就开始学习该做什么才能赚钱了，知道了吗？你开始学习了！





第五章


特别痴迷于股市的人会出错，我觉得这就像是太过专业化后就容易走入死胡同一样，少了灵活的东西就会得不偿失。不能只把投资看成是单靠数学或一些定律就能做好的事情。不管主要的法则多严格，就算我在看股市行情的时候，也不光是玩点计算题，其中有我称之为股票行为的东西，就是股票的动作，能够让我根据我所观察到的前例，判断股票是否会这样运动。如果一只股票不能尽如人意，就不能乱动。如果连其中的原因都搞不清，也就无法预估市场行情，没办法判断，就无法预测股票，也就赚不到钱。

观察股票走势，研究过去的变化走向，这是一门古老的学问。刚来纽约时，我就在一家股票公司听到一个法国人卖弄他的图表，当时我以为他是公司的一个弄臣。但是后来我发现他说的话都经得起验证，富有感染力。他说股市图表是唯一不骗人的东西，靠着图表就可以预估股票走势，以此分析股市。比如为什么凯恩可以操纵股票，在炒作凯奇逊股票的时候大赚特赚，而在投资南太平洋股票的时候却一败涂地。有的职业股民也尝试过这个法国人的方法，可不久就走回了老路，他们觉得靠运气投机的风险没那么大。那个法国人说过，凯恩也确信他的图表是完全没错的，可是在变幻多端的股市中，这个方法太慢了。

那时候，有一家股票公司保存了股价走势图，它能显示出几个月内每只股票的走势情形，通过比较个别股票和总的变化趋势，记住一些规律，股民们就能判断出他们靠不科学的消息买的股票是不是真的要上涨。他们把这张图当成了一种辅助性的资料来源。如今很多股票公司都有这样的图表，是统计专家们专门统计绘制的，除了股票走势外，还有商品期货的走势图。

或者我可以这样说，图表只对能看懂图表的人起作用，准确点说，只对能吸收图表信息的人有所帮助。一般的人看图容易变得执迷不悟，认定底部和头部，主要和次要波动，就是股票投机的一切。要是他把这种信心推展到理智的极限，他注定会破产。有个脑瓜子好使的人，他做过一家著名交易所的合伙人，还是位有实力的数学家。他从知名技校毕业，发明了各种图表，他专门研究过大量市场——股票、债券、谷物、棉花、货币等各种东西的价格形势，还追溯它们过去几年的关联和变化的所有方面。很多年里，他都在使用图表，他所做的事情其实是利用一些极为高明的平均法。听说他是常胜将军，一直到世界大战改变了市场性质才作罢。他说他和手下人在退出市场之前，赔掉了几百万。可一切都得看形势，牛市就是牛市，熊市也只能是熊市，谁都没办法阻止。想赚钱的人，都必须要正确地预估形势，确定是不是具备条件。

我无意这样谈论得离题太远，但是一想到自己在华尔街的最初几年，就忍不住这样。现在我弄懂了当时的很多事情，那时候犯的错都是一个普通投资人一直在犯的错。

第三次到达纽约后，我干得很积极，就为了能在交易所出一条道，我不指望能像在对赌行一样厉害，但我想过一阵子，我应该能够用很多很多的资金操作，我应该会有更好的表现。我明白我最大的问题是没弄懂股票赌博与股票投机的差别，不过我毕竟有天赋和七年研究股市行情变化的经验，我不只是赚钱了，而且赚了很多。我像以前有赢有输，但大致上都能赢钱。我赚得多，消费得也多，大家都这样，不见得是所有赚了容易钱的人才这样，而是不愿意攒钱的人才大手大脚。罗素·塞奇就是如此，他能赚也能攒，到入土的时候钱多得惊人。

每天，我都会从上午十点忙乎到下午三点，沉浸其中。三点以后，才是我享受生活的时刻。请别搞错，我不会让享受影响赚钱，我赔钱是因为判断出错，不是生活无度造成的。我从来不让精神恍惚或喝酒喝到手足酸麻妨碍我的游戏。任何事情都别想损害我的健康。就连现在我也常在十点前就入睡。即使年轻我也不熬夜，因为睡不好就干不好。我的表现比打平还好，这就是我认为不必剥夺生活中美好事物的原因。股市能满足你的所有需求，讲得职业一点儿，炒股是为了生活，所以要端正态度，自信心也就随之而来了。

我在炒股中的第一个改变是时间因素。我不像在对赌行里等尘埃落定了再出手，赚个一两点，我现在想在富勒顿公司顺势而为，就要早出手、迅速，也就是说，我必须要钻研市场，预测形势。这听起来没什么意思，但你应该明白，在炒股上转变态度对我是非常重要的。我慢慢懂得了在股价不稳时赌一把和提前预估股价的跌涨，以及赌博与投机，它们之间有着根本的差异。

我需要提前一小时以上的时间开始研究市场，就算在世界上最牛的对赌行，我也不可能明白这个。我对产业报告、铁路盈余、金融财务和商业统计都兴趣盎然。当然了，我喜欢玩大手笔，所以人们才送外号“投机分子”。我也爱研究股市行情，所有能帮助我去玩一把的事情，我都非常热心。在处理事情之前，我会仔细分析，只要觉得自己已经明白该从哪里入手了，就会去实际验证一番。自然，要证明只有一个办法，那就是用我的钱去证明。

现在看来我的进步似乎比较慢，可是于我而言已经很快了，因为整体来看我还是赚了钱，如果一直赔钱的话，可能会刺激着我花更多精力去研究股市。我必然也有很多问题没察觉。但是我不敢肯定亏钱的真正价值，如果亏得太多，我就没钱验证我的那些改变是否有效了。

研究我在富勒顿公司赚钱的操作方法之后我明白了，虽然我对股市行情和走势的预估一直是绝对正确的，但是我赚到的钱还是不多，原因何在？

没有彻底胜利，就跟失败了一样，也需要研究一番才行。

比如，在多头市场股价刚涨的时候，我就买进，它也按照我的预估在持续上涨，这就证明我的方法有效，到现在为止，一切都很顺利。那么我还需要做些什么呢？我听了老手们的话，不让年轻人莽撞乱窜，下决心小心谨慎地玩。谁都知道，要这样做，唯一的办法是获利落袋，然后在回调时买回你的股票。我就这么做了，确切点说，我尽量这么做着。我经常在获利落袋之后，等待从来没有出现的回调。我谨慎地怀揣着只有4个点的利润，可抛掉的股票还会继续上涨10个点，我只能眼睁睁地看着。大家都说钱能装到口袋就算有钱，是的，你是有点钱，可是在多头市场中只赚了4个点就收手，你也不会富有。

本来能赚2万，而我只赚了2000，这是力求稳妥造成的。当我发现自己其实只赚到了本来该赚的那些钱的一小部分时，我也明白了一些其他道理：根据经验的多少，傻瓜也分不同的等级。

新手一无所知，每一个人，包括他自己，都知道这一点。但是下一级或是下下一级的人认为他知道很多，而且让别人觉得他确实是这样。他是有经验的傻瓜，他做过研究，不是研究市场本身，而是研究更傻的人所说的一些市场评论。第二级傻瓜知道如何避免完全新手所犯的某些错误，避免亏损。就是这种半桶水，而不是百分之百的学徒，才是证券经纪商真正全年无忧的衣食父母。平均起来，这种人可以熬大约三年半，相比之下，通常第一次攻击华尔街的人只能熬3周到30周不等。那种半桶水的人，经常引述著名的交易格言以及各种游戏规则，他们对能言善辩的老手们所说的所有禁忌事项都一清二楚——只是不知道最重要的一条禁忌，就是不要当傻瓜。

半桶水的这种人认为自己已经懂事了，他喜欢在下跌时买进。他等待股价下跌，他根据股价从头部跌下多少钱来判定是否捡到便宜。在牛市，纯粹的傻瓜完全不知道规则和前例，会盲目地买进，因为他有盲目的希望。他赚到最多的钱，一直到一次正常的调整把他所有的利润都拿走为止。但是谨慎的二级傻瓜——就像我自以为是地玩这个游戏时一样——所做的事情是根据别人的智慧操作。我知道我必须改变自己在对赌行交易的方法，也认为我正在解决自己的问题，用的是备受交易老手们推崇、具有极高价值的方法。

大多数人都一样，你很难找到几个人能够诚实地说华尔街没有欠他们钱。富勒顿公司里也常有这样一群傻瓜，各种级别的都有。不过，有个老手显得很是鹤立鸡群。首先，他年龄比较大，其次，他没有好为人师的特点，也不卖弄赚了多少钱，他最擅长的是探听别人嘴里互传的各种内幕消息，而对市场本身的内幕不太热衷——也就是说，他从来不问说话的人听到什么或知道什么。要有人对他说了内幕消息，他会很感激，而且那些内幕消息如果确实起到了作用，他会更加感激，如果不准确，他也没什么怨言，所以别人不会知道他是不是真的受这些消息影响了。据说这人有很多钱，玩得也很大，只不过交易频率不是很高，至少别人所知的是这样。他叫帕特里奇，因为胸肌很发达，总把下巴托在胸前在各个屋子来回乱窜，所以人们偷偷给他起个“火鸡”的外号。

这些客户全都乐于在别人催促下，被迫做一些事情，好把失败归咎到别人身上，他们经常去向帕特里奇请教，对他说有内幕消息的人建议他们买哪只股票，在出手之前希望能请帕特里奇指教一二。不过他们所说的内幕，无论是让他们抛掉的还是买进的，在帕特里奇那里得到的建议都是一样的。

顾客们在说完困惑后总会问：“您觉得我该怎么做更好？”

老火鸡脑袋一歪，满脸慈父般的笑容，盯着提问的人，富含深情地说：“你知道，这是牛市。”

我就常听到他这么说：“嗯，你知道的，是牛市。”就好像他给你一个无价的护身符，用100万美元的保险单包起来一般，我确实听不明白他的意思到底是什么。

有一天，一个叫艾尔默·哈伍德的人匆忙跑进来，填了一张单子交给办事的人后就去找帕特里奇。帕特里奇这时候正在听一个叫约翰·范宁的人在倒苦水：有次他听到凯恩填了张交易单给经纪人，也就跟着做了100股，卖掉后只赚了3个点，但是当他卖出后三天，这只股票就上涨了24个点。这个故事约翰对帕特里奇至少说过四次，可老火鸡总是微笑着点点头，就像刚听到一样。

艾尔默直接打断了约翰，也没致歉，就走过去对老火鸡说：“帕特里奇先生，我刚卖了克莱曼汽车公司的股票，有知情人说市场应该会回调，到时候我再低价买回来，一定能赚的。你最好也一起玩吧，如果你还抱着这只股票的话，不会赔的。”

艾尔默疑惑地看着老火鸡，像其他提供内幕消息的那些人一样，消息未得到证实，就认为他们拥有接受他们内幕消息的人的身心。

老火鸡也是一副感激样儿：“是啊，哈伍德先生，我仍然抱着这只股票，当然抱着。”看来他非常感谢艾尔默心里还想着他这个老家伙。

艾尔默说：“喏，这是你赚钱的机会，下一轮的时候再买进。”他像刚刚替老火鸡填写了存款单一样。看不到老火鸡脸上有什么感激神色，艾尔默继续说：“我刚才把我手里的都卖了。”从他的声音和样子来判断，你就是保守估计，也会认为他卖了100股。

但是帕特里奇很遗憾地摇着头说：“不，不行，我不会卖的。”

艾尔默大喊：“什么？”

“我不能卖。”帕特里奇很苦恼地说。

“我这不给你提供内幕消息让你卖吗？”

“是啊，艾尔默先生，特别感激你，确实是，可是……”

“慢着，你听我说完！难道这个股票不是十天涨了7个点吗？”

“是这样，非常感谢，老弟，但我是不会卖的。”

艾尔默很不理解：“你真不卖？”他一脸疑惑。人们在提供内幕消息给别人时就是这个样子。

“不，我不卖。”

艾尔默踏前了一步问：“为什么不卖啊？”

“不为什么，现在是牛市。”一说这句话，就好像他的解释已经很到位了。

艾尔默很失望，生气地说：“好吧，我也知道是牛市，可是你还是卖了吧，在跌落的时候再买回来，不是就可以降低成本了吗？”

老火鸡很无奈地说：“小伙子啊，我现在要是卖掉，就会失去我的头寸，我以后怎么办？”

艾尔默挥了一下手，摇着头走向我，很关心地悄悄问：“你听清了没？”他用演戏般的语气低声问我，“我问你。”

我没说话，他又接着说：“我对他讲了克莱曼公司的内幕消息，他买了500股，赚了7个点，我现在让他卖掉，等股价跌的时候再买回来。他怎么回答我的？他说卖掉就没活可干了，你明白这话吗？”

老火鸡插话道：“请你原谅，哈伍德先生，我没说没活可干了，我说的是就会失去我的头寸。等你到我这把年纪的时候，千锤百炼过了，就会知道失去头寸是任何人都承受不起的，连洛克菲勒都承受不起。我期盼这只股票回调，好让你能用低价买回来你的那些股票。可我只能根据自己多年的经验进行交易，我为这些经验付过昂贵的学费，不想再重蹈覆辙。我仍然像已经赚钱了一样地感激你。你知道的，这是牛市。”老火鸡说完走了，留下艾尔默一脸纳闷。

那时候我对帕特里奇的话没多大感觉。想到以前股市好的时候，经常没赚到该赚的钱，我猛然意识到帕特里奇那些话中的道理，越想越觉得他很聪明。他年轻时也做过傻事，必定明白自己的人性弱点。过去的惨痛让他学会了不再受诱惑，因为要付出很大的代价，对于我也是一样。

帕特里奇最后总要对其他人说：“嗯，你懂的，这是牛市。”其实他的言外之意是，要赚钱就得看整个股市行情，而不是单个股价波动。也就是说，不能光看交易所的报价器上的数字，要研究整个股市行情和走向。明白了这个，我就觉得自己又长进了不少。

在华尔街闯荡这么多年，输输赢赢了几百万美元，我想告诉你一点：我能赚那么多钱，跟我的想法没什么关系，重要的是我能够坚持不动，懂了吗？是我坚持不动啊。能判断出股价走势不算什么本事。在牛市，有很多早早就做多的投资人，在熊市也有很多早早就做空的投资人。我认识很多看盘的厉害角色，他们也能瞅准最佳时间买卖股票，他们的经验跟我也差不离。可是呢，他们却没赚到多少钱。能够同时判断准确又坚持不动的人并不多，我觉得这才是最难学习的地方。股民们只有彻底理解了这点，才会赚大钱。搞懂了怎么样去交易而赚几百万，比不懂交易时赚几百美元还容易。

因为能把股市走向看得很明白的股民在看到股市行情跟他们预估的一样时，总会表现得焦虑不安，就是这样。华尔街的很多投资人都不是傻蛋，但是最终还是赔了，道理就在这里。不是股市让他们损兵折将，而恰恰是他们战胜不了自己。他们的聪明不能保证他们会坚持不动。老火鸡恰恰在这方面做得很好，他是那样说的，也是那样做的，他有坚持的勇气，也有坚忍的耐力。

不理会股市大的波动，光想着抢进抢出，是我的病灶所在。没人能够抓住所有的波动，在牛市，你要做的就是买进和攥在手里，坚持到你相信涨势快停的时候。想做到这一点，必须要搞清楚整体形势，并非只抓内幕消息和影响个股的特殊因素。你要忘掉你所有的股票，永远忘掉！一直到股市逆转，新一轮的走势就要到了为止。你必须要让你的头脑和观察判断能力发挥作用，不然我告诉你的这些就像低买高卖一样无意义。谁都该学会不要试图最后一刻卖出或第一时间买进，这两个时段太贵了，它们让很多股友的千百万美元葬送在了股海里，这些钱多到能建造一条横跨美洲的公路了。

我分析了一下在富勒顿公司的炒股情况，发现我一开始的那些交易大都赚了钱，这样自然使我决定一开始就玩大的。这让我对自己的判断很有信心，但是有很多次，我都被别人的建议甚至自己的不耐烦破坏掉了。一个人如果没有自信，就不会在这一行干出多少成绩来。我总结的经验是，全面研究行情，坚守住头寸。我耐心安分地坚持着，遇到了挫折也不慌乱，我明白这些都会过去。我一度放空过10万股，看出大反弹即将来临，这种反弹是不可避免的，甚至是健全的，在我的账面利润上会造成100万美元的差别，我预估到了这个结果，但是我还是纹丝不动，让一半的账面利润溜走，我根本没想着去把卖空的股票买回来，等到股价涨高了再抛掉。因为假如我那样做的话，可能会失掉头寸，从而失去确定赚大钱的机会。只有大的波动才能够赚大钱。

若说我学会这些花的时间太长，那是因为这些都来自我从失败中总结的经验。从失败到了解失败，这期间需要花很多时间；从了解失败到正确判定失败，这中间花费的时间更多。但同时，我干得还不错。我年龄还小，一切都还来得及。我赚钱的方式仍然有一部分还是靠研究那些股票记录单，因为这个方法适合当时的股市状况。我也不像更早一些时候那样经常赔钱，也不会赔得那么生气。回想一下，在一年多时间里，我破产了三次，所以没什么值得我骄傲的。我告诉你，破产是很好的教育机构。

我的资金并没有增加得很快，因为我一直尽量享受生活。其实我并没有有意识地阻止自己去享受我这个岁数和级别的人该有的生活，我有自己的轿车，能够从股市赚钱的时候，让自己的生活太拮据没什么意思。只有在周日和公休日，股市才不会开盘，情形本来就是如此。当我知道自己哪里出错的时候，我就会给自己新设置一条不该触碰的红线。享受我不断增长的财富的最好办法，就是不要削减生活开支。我当然有一些有趣的经验，其中一些并非这么有趣，但是如果我全部说出来一定说不完。事实上，那些在炒股中很重要的教训也很容易让我记忆犹新，正是这些教训督促着我对市场和自己更加了解。





第六章


1906年春，我远离股市，在亚特兰大度了个短假，想换换环境好好休整一下。顺便提一下，我回到了一开始的那个经纪商哈丁兄弟公司。我玩得很活跃，能够操作三四千股，这没比我20岁的时候在柯斯莫斯普利坦公司里玩得大多少，但是在纽约交易所，经纪商替我买卖股票，与在对赌行里赌1点的波动是完全不同的。

你或许记得我提到过一件事，就是在柯斯莫斯普利坦公司时，我放空3500股制糖公司的股票后，感觉不太对头后想马上结束交易的那一次。该怎么说呢，我经常会在冥冥之中有这种奇怪的感觉，我经常会遵照这种感觉行事。可有时我又告诉自己，光靠一时半会儿的冲动就改变自己的头寸是一件蠢事。我把自己的这种感觉归因于抽的雪茄太多，导致睡眠不足，肝脏不太好。每当我克制了自己的这种冲动，坚持我一开始的看法时，又总能找到些后悔的地方。好多回我都自我克制着没有卖出，隔天去看，市场会很强劲，甚至可能上涨，于是我跟自己说遵从感觉卖出多么愚蠢。但是再过一天，股价一定会有大跌。在起起落落的过程中，我明白了要赚钱不一定光靠理智和逻辑头脑，还要靠心理感应。

我说件事，这件事对我影响很大。它发生在1906年我在亚特兰大休假时期。有个同样是哈丁兄弟公司客户的朋友与我同行，那时候假期令人愉悦，我一点儿都不想靠近股市。当然，要是市场特别好，我的头寸又特别大的时候，我是没法停止炒股而去玩耍的。我记得当时是牛市，虽然股市跌了一点儿，不过各种迹象都表明它会上涨，所以人们都信心饱满。

有一天早晨吃过饭后，我读了纽约的所有早报，也看烦了这样的日常场景：海鸥叼着蚌飞到大约6米高的地方，然后把它们丢到硬邦邦的潮湿的沙滩上，美美地吃上一顿。于是我和朋友到木板大道上闲逛，这算是一天里最好玩的事了。

还没到中午，我缓步走在街上，呼吸着咸咸的空气，百无聊赖地消磨着时间。在这里，有个哈丁兄弟公司的分部，我们每天早上都要顺道去看看开盘情况，这成了无聊之人的习惯。

这次我们发现股市行情很好，交易也很活跃，朋友非常看好此时的市场，他手里有一些在股价很低时买进的股票。他对我说，持股等着价格上涨真是明智的做法。我对他的话并没有太在意，也不屑于与他讨论。我看了看报价板，发现大多数股票都已经上涨，然后看到太平洋铁路公司的股票，我觉得此时应该把它卖掉，也不知道为什么这么想，反正就有这样的感觉。我自问原因，可就是无法回答。

我紧盯着报价板，但是因为一直想着这件事，什么也看不进去，满脑子想的都是要放空太平洋铁路公司的股票，我无法解释为什么会有这样的想法。

我的神情在别人看来一定很奇怪，站在旁边的朋友碰了我一下，问我：“喂，怎么了？”

“我也不知道。”我只能这么说。

“你困了？”

“没有，”我说，“我没困。”

我想放空太平洋股票，我总能够靠着这样的感觉获利。

我直接走向有空白单子的桌位，朋友跟在我后面。我迅速填好要卖掉1000股太平洋铁路股票的单子后，递给经理。一脸笑容的经理看完单子后脸色马上变了。他瞪着我问道：“不会吧？”我没说话，只是望着他。之后，他马上把单子递给了操作员。

朋友问我：“你这是干什么？”

“我要卖掉这只股票。”我说。

“啊？”他大喊了一声。他是多头，而我却要做空，这里面一定有什么问题。

“太平洋铁路的1000股。”我说。

“为什么呀？”他显得很激动。

我摇了摇头，没法告诉他原因，可他肯定觉得我捏着内幕消息呢。他拉着我的胳膊把我拽到门外没人的地方，这里也不会有人听到我们说什么。

“你有什么内幕消息吗？”他问我。

他很激动，太平洋铁路是他最爱的股票之一，因为这家公司的发展前景很好，他坚信握着不撒手可以赚钱，不过他也愿意听到些负面消息。

“什么消息也没啊。”我说。

“怎么可能？”很明显，他怀疑我说谎。

“真的没什么消息。”

“那你为什么要卖掉？”

“我也不清楚。”我的确没说假话。

“呵呵，算了吧你。”他说。他了解我是个有的放矢的稳当人，可现在却要卖掉1000股太平洋铁路。在市场走势这么好的情况下，我卖出这么多股，一定有充足的理由。

“我不知道啊。”我说，“我就是觉得会发生些什么。”

“发生什么？”

“不知道！我说不明白，我只是想抛掉，我还想再追卖1000股。”

我再次走回桌子旁边，又卖掉了1000股。如果刚才卖那1000股是对的，我就该多卖掉些。

“到底会有什么事呀？”朋友不依不饶地问我，他也犹豫起来，在考虑是不是要学我这样。如果我直接对他说获得了这只股票要下跌的内幕消息，他肯定就不会纠缠着问了，连谁说的和为什么这样的白痴问题都不会问，而会直接学我卖掉。

“什么事都可能有，可我没法保证一定有什么事，我没办法对你说清原因，我又不能预知未来。”我说。

“你要疯了。”他说，“你这个疯子，没有原因就要卖掉股票，你真的不清楚原因吗？”

“我真不知道，我就是想卖掉。”我说。想抛股票的感觉来势汹汹，我就又卖了1000股。朋友这下快崩溃了，他抓着我的胳膊说：“听着，我们快离开这里，以免你放空整个股市。”

我已经卖掉了很多，心里舒服了，所以也就没等后面那2000股的成交单，就直接跟着他离开了。对我来说，即使有最好的理由，放空那么多股已经很多了。没什么理由，尤其股市行情整体不错，没有人会觉得熊市要来，放空那么多似乎更是过分。不过，每次我要是想卖的时候却没有出手，就总会非常后悔。

我把这样的事情讲给朋友们听，有的人就对我说，那不是莫名的感觉，而是一种潜意识的思维，就是所谓创造性的工作思维。源于这样的思维，艺术家们会做出一些连自己都无法搞清楚的事来。而我，可能是受到很多小因素的联合刺激，这些小因素单个来说毫无意义，集合起来却很有力量。或许朋友那种不靠谱的自信也激发了我否定的精神，所以要选择抛掉太平洋铁路的股票来释放，因为这是一只众所周知会上涨的股票。我没办法对你说清预感的源头，只知道当我从那里出来时就已经卖掉了3000股，而且是在股市上涨的时候，可我根本不担心。

我想知道后面2000股的成交价格，所以我们吃过午饭后又去了那里。我发现股市的综合行情很好，太平洋的股价也上涨了。

“你算是赔本了。”朋友说。你都能想象得到他没卖这只股票的得意样儿。

第二天，股票继续上涨，除了朋友的得意忘形外，我什么信息也没得到，可我一直觉得我没有卖错，我自认没做错的时候就耐心十足，这有什么道理吗？下午，太平洋的股票就停止了上涨，在那天快收盘时，开始下跌，没多久就跌破到我卖3000股时的价格平均线，我更加觉得自己没做错，我自然必须多放空一些。所以在那天收市之前，我又卖掉了2000股。

就等于说，靠着这种预感，我抛售了太平洋铁路公司的5000股，花完了我在哈丁兄弟公司分部的保证金。度假的时候，我没办法全力应对放空这么多股票的现状，只好放弃了假期，当天晚上就回了纽约。谁都不知道会出什么事，我想我还是回到现场，在更熟悉一点儿的纽约，我能更迅速地应对。

第二天，我们得到了旧金山发生大地震的消息，不过股市开盘只跌了几个点而已，多头很强势，人们不会独立对消息做出反应，这很常见。一旦处于很坚实的牛市，无论是否有报纸所说的多头炒作在进行，某些消息传出时，总是不会像华尔街偏空时那样发挥应有的效果。一切都看当时的人气而定。在这个例子里，华尔街股市没有对地震因素做出评估，因为大家不愿意这样做。在那天结束之前，股价还上涨了些。

我卖掉了5000股，灾难发生了，我的股票却没有下跌。我自信感觉没错，只是我还没挣到钱，连一点儿小利润都没有。与我同去亚特兰大度假的朋友在我卖掉股票时又庆幸又惋惜。他对我说：“预感是存在的，哥们儿，不过当钱和人都倾向于多头时，对抗不管用，他们肯定赢。”

“再等等看。”我说的是股价，我不想逃避，我知道事情比较严峻，太平洋公司的损失是最严重的，可是华尔街却表现得很盲目，真气人。

“等等看？等着你这张皮和其他熊皮都被暴晒在太阳底下，晒成个干皮。”他直截了当地说。

“你会怎么办？”我问，“凭着南太平洋公司和其他铁路公司蒸发了几百万就买太平洋的股票？他们付清损失后下一年的分红从哪里来？你最多觉得问题还不算严重，可就因为这个就买受到严重损失的铁路股票吗？你说啊。”

可朋友只是说：“对，好像有道理，可我告诉你，股市不会与你想的一样，行情记录不会骗人，是吧？”

我说：“行情记录总是滞后，不够及时啊。”

“听我说。在黑色星期五之前，有人和吉姆·菲斯克聊天，举出至少十个金价要下跌的理由。他受自己的话鼓舞，最后对菲斯克说要抛掉几百万的黄金，菲斯克看着他说：‘去吧，赶紧地，卖完了别忘记请我参加你的葬礼哦。’”

“对啊。”我说，“那人如果真的卖掉了黄金，看能捞多少。你也最好卖掉些太平洋的股票。”

“那不可能！我是个顺势而为的人，我这样的人能开心赚钱。”

第二天，出现了更加完善的报道，股市开始下滑了，但是即使到了那个时候，下跌也没预想的那么严重。在我眼里，世界上不存在能阻止股市猛跌的东西，所以我又卖出了5000股。是啊，这时候很多人都知道怎么回事了，我的经纪人也乐意效劳了。这不是谁的错，我预估的股市行情没错。过了一天，股市迅速下跌，我借机又卖出去1万股。这是唯一可以做的事。

我不想其他，只知道自己没错，绝对正确，这是个绝佳的好机会，只看我怎么来利用。我持续地抛售着。难道我没有想过，万一卖了这么多，要是股市反弹了，我的利润就会打了水漂，甚至连本钱都丧失掉吗？谁知道我想过没有，就算想过也不会有什么压力，我不是个鲁莽的赌徒，而是很小心谨慎的，谁都不能把地震造成的损失补回来，不是吗？谁也不能在一个晚上就免费把坍塌的高楼复原，不是吗？

我没有鲁莽，没有发疯，也没有被胜利冲昏头脑，更不会觉得一大部分旧金山在地图上消失了，一个城市成了废墟，是的，一点儿都没错。我没有把心思花在等着恐慌发生上，好吧，第二天我就平仓，赚了25万美金，这是我炒股以来获利最多的一次，而且就这么几天时间。刚开始时，华尔街一点儿都不理会地震的影响，他们还说一开始的那些报道没多严重。可我想说的是，要想转变公众对待股市的看法，得需要很长时间，就连职业股民在大部分时间里都是迟缓而短视的。

我没什么需要解释的，不管科学还是戏说。我只是对你讲讲我是怎么做的，为什么要这样做，最后获得了什么。我注重的不是那个神奇的预感，而是我获利25万的事情。这件事情说明，只要给我机会，我就可以做得更大。

那年夏天，我到了萨拉托加温泉度假，可总想着要看看股市。起初没多累，想想股市也不烦躁，而且我在这里认识的人都对炒股兴趣很大，我们顺理成章地就讨论上了。我觉得说和做之间有很大区别，有的人会让你想到那种像对待懦夫一样跟脾气暴躁的老板谈话的大胆的职员——确实让你有这种感觉，他们只懂得嘴上那一套。

哈丁兄弟公司在萨拉托加也有分部，而且客户还不少，真正的原因是做了广告。实际上在偏远的地方开设分部这件事本身就是打广告，我也总会顺道去转转，坐在人堆边上瞅瞅。那里的经理是从纽约总部过来的，很和善，对朋友和陌生人都会热心帮忙，也会借机拉一些业务。这里是内幕消息充斥的地方——赌马的、股票的、跑堂的——哪方面的消息都有，分部的人很清楚我对这些没兴趣，经理也不会向我悄悄透露他从纽约获得什么秘密。他只是把电报拿给我看，并说：“这是他们刚刚发的。”只有这样。

我自然要盯着股市，对我而言，看报价板和研究判断各种迹象是一种程序。我看到我的老伙计太平洋铁路的股票又上涨了，而且还比较高，有人在买进，我观察了两天还是没有买。我能肯定有个大客户在买进，他肯定是个有大量资金而且知道怎么操作的高手，我觉得他很聪明。

我确定了这点后，立刻以160美元左右的价格大力买进。这只股票继续表现良好，所以我继续买进，每次成交500股，我买得越多，股市越强劲，却没有急速冲刺，我很满意，我知道这只股票没有理由不猛涨。

经理忽然走到我跟前，他说纽约发电报了，问我在不在这里。得到答复后，有人过来说，让我等会儿，哈丁先生要跟我通话。

我说没问题，就又趁机买了太平洋的500多股，我不知道哈丁先生要对我说什么，估计不是关于炒股的事情，因为我有足够的保证金来玩。经理很快就来对我说，艾德·哈丁先生打长途电话找我。

我说：“你好，艾德。”

可是却听到他说：“你到底在干吗？你疯了呀？”

“是你疯了吧？”我说。

“你到底要干什么？”他又问。

“你这是什么意思？”

“你买那么多那只股票干什么？”

“怎么了？我的保证金不够吗？”

“与保证金无关，是让你别这么蠢。”

“我不知道你在说什么。”

“你买太平洋的股票干吗？”

“因为它在上涨啊。”我说。

“上涨个鬼啊！你难道不知道内部人士正在倒货给你吗？你大概是最好欺骗的人了，还不如去赌马呢，赔得还有劲儿。你别让他们给耍了。”

“没人耍我。”我对他说，“我没告诉过任何人。”

他继续说：“你不要以为每次掉进去都会发生奇迹，你有机会就快退出来。那些大户们都使劲儿往外卖呢，你还这样买，简直是胡闹。”

“从记录上看，是有人在买进啊。”我一根筋地说。

“你啊，你的单子过来的时候我都快犯心脏病了，别傻了，赶快退出来吧，说崩盘就崩盘了，我言尽于此，再见。”说完他挂了电话。

哈丁很聪明，消息也非常灵通，没有什么坏心眼儿，是个能做朋友的人，而且他所在的位置可以帮助他获取很多内幕。我买进太平洋的股票，靠的是这么多年对股票走势的研究，以及我所看到的一些蛛丝马迹，以经验来看，有迹象表明股价会大幅上涨。我不知道自己看出了什么变化，但是我猜想。我一定断定：我认定股票被人买进，完全是因为有内线在捣鬼。可能哈丁的话对我起了很大作用，他要制止我不能犯这么一个赔上老本的错，不管是他的能力还是动机，都是值得信任的。所以我听了他的话，我也不知道为什么要这么听他的话。

我抛空了太平洋的股票，不能做多头的时候当然要做空头，不然就是个蠢货。所以我卖掉了那些股票后又抛了4000股，差不多都是以162美元的价格。

隔天太平洋公司董事宣布要配股一成。一开始华尔街上没人相信这个消息。报纸开始抨击这家公司董事会，就在华尔街的高手们不知所措、犹豫不决时，市场沸腾了起来，一些在场的股民在一个小时内就赚了不少。我甚至听说有个笨蛋不小心买错股票，结果却赚了35万，第二周就卖掉了他在交易所的席位，去做农场主了。

我听到配股一成的消息后，就发觉我是活该倒霉，不听经验的指挥，却偏信内幕消息，结果受了这么大损失。我仅凭一个头脑清醒的朋友没有私心的劝告，就对他的警告深信不疑，从而失掉了自己的原则。

当看到太平洋股票创造了纪录后，我就对自己说：“真不该卖掉这只股票啊。”

我现在只剩下哈丁兄弟公司分部的保证金了，这让我没有高兴或者不高兴，显然我对股市行情的判断是对的，但却愚蠢地听从了哈丁先生的话。事后说别人是不对的，而且我也不能再浪费时间，既然木已成舟，我就只能下单补空头。我按照每股大概165美元的价格买了太平洋的4000股，也就损失了3个点。在收盘之前，经纪人以172美元和174美元的股价买了一部分。我拿到单子后算了一下，因为哈丁先生的好心干扰，我赔了4万美元，这次教训还不算贵，对一个连坚持自己做法的勇气都没有的人来说，这是个小代价。

我不太懊恼，按照行情记录来看，股价还会上涨，这是罕有的波动，董事会做出的决定也是亘古未有，不过这次我要遵照自己的想法来做，我平了4000股的空头，准备根据股市的行情记录玩一把，赚点钱。所以我毫无顾虑地买了4000股，第二天早上时，我卖掉了它们，这不光让我赚回了赔掉的4万美元，还净赚了1.5万。如果不是哈丁那么替我着想，我一下子就能赚很大一笔，但他也算帮了我一把，这是个教训，我相信这次事件把我锻造成了一个真正的股市商人。

我并不是说我所要学习的只是不去受内幕消息摆布，坚守自己的原则，而是我真正找到了自信，从根本上与以前炒股的老方法划清了界限。萨拉托加的这次经历是我最后一次依靠冒险和运气赚钱，自此以后，我就开始全盘考虑股市，而不只是单独地拘泥于个别股票。通过努力学习，我终于让自己在这个行业里达到了更高的层次，这一步走得的确漫长而艰辛。





第七章


我会告诉别人自己是看好市场，还是不太看好市场，但我不对别人说买进还是卖出。熊市来了，所有股票都会跌，牛市来了则正好相反。不过，不包括由战争引发的那种熊市，因为军火方面的股票会因为战争而上涨。我说的是一般情况。但是通常而言，人们不愿意考虑到底是牛市还是熊市，他们只想很清晰地知道买什么或者卖什么，不想用脑子去思考，要他们数数从地上捡起来的钱他们都嫌麻烦。

我没有那么懒惰，我只是觉得单独研究一只股票比通盘考虑股市要方便。同样，考虑一只股票的起伏比考虑全盘股市的起落要简单。我明白我必须要改变这种想法，而我确实也做到了。

人们想搞懂炒股的基本原则没那么简单，之前我总说最好在上涨的市场里买进股票，但如今重要的不是能不能买到便宜的股票，或者卖出高价股票，而是在正确的时机买进或卖出。当我在看空的时候卖掉股票，卖出价格肯定是一次比一次低。买入股票则相反，我一定是逐步向上承接。我肯定在股价上涨时买，不会在下跌时做多头。

假设，我正在买进某只股票。我会用110美元买入2000股，如果我买进后股票上涨到了111美元，那对我就是有益的，上涨1个点，说明盈利了。是啊，因为我是对的，所以会跟进2000股。如果股市还在上涨，我还会买2000股。比如价格到了114美元，我认为这时候我已经暂时买够了，我有了可以干一把的资本。我用平均111又3/4的价格做多6000股，现在涨到114美元，我就不会再买，而是等着看看。我估计涨到差不多了就会有回调，我想看看股市在回调之后有什么表现。很有可能会跌到第三次买2000股时候的价格，如果又上涨后跌回112又1/4，然后回升，到达113又3/4时，我会马上花市价买4000股。此时，我用113又3/4的价格买到了4000股后，就知道哪里有问题，再下个单子测试一下，也就是卖掉1000股来测试市场的反应。但是，如果我在111又3/4时买进4000股，在114时买进2000股，在114又1/2时买进500股，那么如果股市继续上涨，最后500股我就在115又1/2时成交，这时候我就知道我的操作是对的。就是这个买入4000股的经历，使得我知道了在那种特殊状态买特殊的股票是不是对——当然了，我已经把整个行情考虑明白了，在牛市的时候，我从来不买太便宜或者太容易买到的股票。

我记得我听过一个有关迪肯·怀特的故事。怀特那时候是华尔街的一位大股民，一位特别好的老人，精明又有魄力。据说他在原来属于他的那个时期干过很漂亮的事。

故事发生在早年，那时候制糖公司是市场上最容易迸出火花的股票，公司董事长哈维梅尔的权力也处于巅峰时期。我和前辈们聊过，知道哈维梅尔和他手下人有实力有资本，足以应付那些用他们的股票投机的人。前辈们说哈维梅尔在这只股票上修理过很多人，比其他人在其他股票上修理过的人都要多，所以经纪人在这些人炒股的时候，一般都会使绊子而不是帮忙。

有一天，一个认识怀特的人激动地跑进怀特办公室，说：“你让我有好消息了要告诉你，要是对你有用，你会替我挂进几百股，对不对？”他稍微停了一下后，喘着气等待回答。

迪肯像往常一样冷静地看着他说：“我忘了是不是说过，不过你要真有对我有用的好消息，我就会报答你。”

“那好，我确实有好消息。”

“是吗，那就太好了。”迪肯和善地说。

那人站起来说：“是的，先生。”然后凑近了些，生怕别人听到，“哈维梅尔买了制糖公司的股票。”

“真的？”迪肯很冷静地问。

这让来人很生气，他强调说：“是的，迪肯先生，他是有多少就买了多少。”

“你确定？”迪肯问。

“迪肯，我证据确凿，那些老东西正在不遗余力地买呢，估计跟关税有关吧，制糖公司的普通股能让人大赚，会超过特别股的价钱。我觉得会赚30个点。”

“你真这样觉得？”迪肯透过旧式银丝眼镜盯着他，这副眼镜本来是看股市行情记录用的。

“我真这么认为。据我了解就是这样，绝对的！怎么了，迪肯？哈维梅尔和他的朋友都在买制糖公司的股票，不能赚40点以上他们不会罢休，在他们吃货吃到饱之前，股市如果暴涨起来，我一点儿都不会感到意外的。经纪商手里的筹码已经没有一个月前那么多了。”

“他在买制糖公司股票，是吧？”迪肯若有所思地问。

“买？他那简直就是吞啊，能吞多少就吞多少，根本不限定价格。”

“是吗？”迪肯简单地说。

可这已经把送信的人惹急了，他说：“是的，先生。我觉得这是个特别好的信息，绝对没有水分啊。”

“是吧？”

“是的，这个消息很有用，你不需要吗？”

“哦，是的，我需要。”

“什么时候？”那人狐疑道。

“就是现在，立刻。”迪肯喊了一声，“弗兰克。”弗兰克是他最聪明的经纪人，就在旁边屋里。

“先生。”弗兰克说。

“我想让你去一趟交易所，卖掉1万股制糖公司的股票。”

“卖？”送信的人叫道，他的声音很惊讶，把已经往外走的弗兰克都喊停了。

“怎么了？是卖啊。”迪肯温和地说。

“可我说的是哈维梅尔在买啊。”

“伙计，我知道。”迪肯镇定地说完后转身对弗兰克说，“弗兰克，快去。”

弗兰克快步去办了，送信的人满脸通红。

“我来你这里，”他生气地说，“带来了大好消息，我把你当朋友才告诉你，我觉得你很正直，我想让你根据这个消息动起来……”

“我正在动啊。”迪肯平静地打断了他。

“可我告诉你的是哈维梅尔他们在买进。”

“是的，我听明白了。”

“买，买，我说的是他们在买。”送信人大吼起来。

“是买，我听清了。”迪肯说。他站在自动收报机前，盯着行情记录看。

“但是你却在卖。”

“对，卖1万股。”老头点点头。

然后，他开始沉默，专心盯着记录。送信人也凑过来，想知道他在看什么，这个老家伙很狡猾。正当他想通过迪肯的肩膀看时，有个职员拿着一张单子走进来了，正是弗兰克的汇报单。迪肯只看了一眼。他从行情记录上已经看出了情况。

于是他对那职员说：“让他再卖1万股。”

“迪肯，我发誓，他们真的在买啊。”

“是哈维梅尔对你说的？”迪肯一如既往地镇定。

“当然不是，他不会对任何人说任何事情的，他连帮最好的朋友赚一毛钱都不干。可我知道这是真的。”

“别激动，伙计。”迪肯抬了抬手，继续看行情记录。送信人无奈地说：“要是早知道你要做的事情跟我期望的相反，我就不该来浪费你的时间，也浪费了我的时间，可你若因此而赔惨了，我也不会高兴，我为你感到惋惜，迪肯。不好意思，我要去其他地方验证我的信息了。”

“我在做呀，我明白自己不太了解股市，至少没你和你的朋友哈维梅尔那么了解，可是我也略知一二，我现在就是根据经验和你带来的消息做出正确举动。像我这样一个人，在华尔街混了这么多年，任何人为我感到惋惜，我都会很感谢。镇定些，朋友。”

那人紧盯着迪肯，非常佩服他的判断和勇气。

刚才那个职员很快又进来了，把一份单子交给迪肯。迪肯看过后说：“现在让弗兰克买3万股。”

职员快步离开了，送信的人小声嘀咕了一句，瞧着那个头发花白的老狐狸。

“伙计，”迪肯和善地解释，“我并不是怀疑你带来的消息不属实，就算我听到哈维梅尔亲自对你说了，我也会像刚才那样做，因为只有这样才能验证是不是有人像哈维梅尔一样买入了股票。第一个1万股卖得很容易，这说明不了什么，可第二个也卖了，股价还在上涨，2万股都这样被吸走了，说明确实有人想统统收入囊中。就这而言，谁买的并不是很重要，所以我平了以后，又买了1万股，到现在为止你提供的消息都是好消息。”

“有多好？”送信人问。

“你会得到500股，价格是那1万股的均价。”迪肯说，“再见，伙计，下次镇定些。”

“好的，迪肯。”他说，“你卖出你的股票的时候也帮我卖掉吧，我比你知道的少多了。”

道理就是这样，所以我从来不会买便宜的股票。当然我总是设法很有效地买进，以便协助我所操作的方向。至于卖股票嘛，很明显，只有有人愿意买的时候，你才能卖掉。

假如你玩的是个大手笔，就得随时记住这一点，要先细察情势，再认真做好计划，最后才去实行。你如果握有很多头寸，并且有很大的浮动利润，就不能随便卖掉。你不能指望在股市中卖掉5万股跟卖掉100股一样简单，只有等到市场可以承接了，才是到了考虑必须卖出的时候。机会来了，就要抓住，而机会需要耐心等待，这是规则。必须等到可以卖的时候卖，而不是你想卖的时候卖。想知道什么时候才是最合适的时机，就要学会观察和尝试。想知道你想卖的股票在股市上什么时候能被吸收，这可没什么秘诀。但是，要开始采取行动时，你必须确定行情特别好，不然你贸然猛进是非常不明智的。请记住，股价不会有高到令你没法买进的时候，也不会低到令你没法卖出的时候。不过在第一笔做完后，除非第一笔有利润，否则别做第二笔。要耐心等，细心看。行情记录会为你提供是否可以开始去做的时机，在合适的时候行动对很多事情都非常重要。我花了很多年才明白这一点，与此同时还花了成千上万美元。

我不希望让人们觉得我是让大家持续加码。当然了，你加码可以赚到不加码赚不到的大钱，可我要说的是，如果有人想买500股，他不是在投机，就不应该一次性买进；如果只是赌一把，我只会建议他别赌。

如果他买了100股，而且立刻赔了，就不该继续买，而该立即认识到错误，认识到至少是暂时出现了错误。





第八章


1906年夏天，经过太平洋铁路股票事件后，我对内幕消息和别人的劝告更加不在乎了，也就是说不管谁多友好，多替我着想，我也不会听他的建议、推测和质疑了。过去很多事都证明我比周围很多人对行情记录的理解都到位，而不是我的虚荣心证明这一点。而且我具备比哈丁兄弟公司其他客户更好的条件，我能完全避免投机偏见。我对做多和放空都没有侧重，就是一直在避免犯错误。

我小的时候，就总能从看到的事实中形成自己的观点，这是我得到结论的唯一方法。我没办法从别人的建议中获得有用价值，而只靠自己掌握的事实。如果我相信了你确信的东西，那是因为我确实完全相信。我做多头，是因为经过分析后我觉得会上涨，但你肯定知道很多看起来很聪明的人觉得会上涨是因为他们手里有股票。我绝不让自己手里的股票和先入为主的观念左右我的思想，这就是我为什么总说，坚决不和股市行情记录争论。如果股市行情突然变化或者不合乎你的预估就让你大发雷霆，正如得了肺炎就生肺的气一样，是非常不值得的。

我慢慢明白了，对于炒股而言，除了要分析股情变化以外还需要注意哪些方面。帕特里奇坚持在牛市保持住头寸的重要性，这使我把主要的精力用在了判断市场性质上。我开始意识到抓住大的股市变化才能多赚钱。不管推动大波动起步的因素可能是什么，事实俱在，大波动能够持续下去，不是内部炒作或是金融家的技巧造成的结果，而是基本形势。不管谁反对，大波动一定会照着背后的推动力量，尽其所能地快速推动到尽头。

萨拉托加事件以后，我更加清晰地明白，或者说，我更加成熟地知道，既然整个市场变化多端，我也就不必像以前想的一样去研究个别股票的走势。而且因为限制交易量，也能通盘买卖，如果某些股票的卖出数量超过了总股本的一定比例后，做空头就很危险，这个比例由哪只股票、在哪里、在谁手里来决定。但是如果他有钱的话，他可以卖出100万股所有挂牌的股票，也不会遭遇轧空。以前，有些内线人士经常从空头方面赚取暴利，他们也细心培养对垄断和轧空的恐惧，从中大赚其钱。

应该要做的事是在牛市时看多，在熊市时看空，这听起来很傻，是不是？但是，我必须要紧抓这一基本原则不放，才能够看出要把这个原则付诸实施，真正的意义是要预测可能性。我花了很长时间才明白怎么样按这个原则炒股，客观地说，我必须要提醒你一下，那时候我还没那么多钱那样玩。你如果有足够的钱，就可以创建很多头寸，在股市波动幅度大的时候赚大钱。

我总是必须，或者认为必须靠炒股赚取日常生活费用，这实际上影响了我增加资金从事根据波动交易的方法，这种方法利润比较高，但是比较缓慢，因此交易成本立刻就变得比较昂贵。

可现在我不仅增强了自信，而且经纪人也不会觉得我是个运气好的投机分子，他们在我这儿赚了很多钱，而我现在顺理成章地成了他们的明星客户。能赚钱的客户对哪个经纪人来说都是宝贝。

那时候，我已经不满足于只研究行情记录，我也不让自己置身于股市波动外，这样一来，我就需要从不同角度来研究股市，从具体的股情，到基本的原则；从股价的涨跌，到交易的基本条件。

一直以来，我都会研究每天的股市信息。所有的玩家都这样。可那些信息大多都是小道消息，有的是故意放的错误信息，有的是个人看法。我连颇受青睐的每周评述都觉得不尽如人意，财经编辑们的观点通常不是我的观点。于他们来说，根据实际情况整理出个结论不算什么，但对我却至关重要，而且我们对时间因素的评估也差得很远，所以我觉得每周末分析本周详情还没有预估下周走势重要。

多年来，我一直都处于经验不足、懵懂无知、缺乏资金的综合状态，而现在我却感受到一种有了大发现的愉悦。我知道了为什么想在纽约多赚钱结果却总赔本。现在有钱了，也有经验和自信了，我特别想赶紧试试这把新钥匙，可却忽略了门上的另外一把锁——时间之锁。这样的大意也很正常，可不得不花钱买教训——每进阶一步都要付出代价。

我分析了1906年的情势，觉得资金市场前景可怕，很多真正的财富都毁于一旦。所有人迟早都会颇感压力，所以没谁能够帮到谁。那种艰苦的日子并不是起源于拿价值1万美元的房子，去交换一车厢价值8000美元的赛马，而是起源于房子被火完全烧毁，而且大多数赛马因为铁路车祸死亡。那种艰苦是因为波尔战争中，实际好用的现金随着炮火化为灰烬，而且千百万美元耗在南非，喂养没有生产力的士兵，这表示我们不能像过去一样，从英国投资者那里得到协助。旧金山地震和火灾，以及其他天灾人祸都深刻波及每个人——制造商、农民、商人、劳工、百万富翁。铁路业受损严重，一切都难逃厄运。如此一来，只有一件事能做，那就是卖掉股票。

我说过，在决定交易方向之前，我已经注意到我最初的交易经常都能够获利。现在我决定做空，毫无疑问，股市正在滑向正儿八经的熊市，所以我确信能在股市上大捞一笔。

股价涨涨跌跌，交易冷淡后变得活跃，我账面上的浮动资金变少了，亏损增大了。终于到了那么一天，连最后一个做空的股民也没法坚持叙述真正空头市场的故事，所以我也平了空头的头寸。就是这个时候，如果不这样，我就穷得连一张明信片都买不起了。我元气大伤，可是留得青山在，不愁没柴烧。

我出错了，可错在何处呢？我在空头市场中看淡后市，这是正确的。我做了空头，这也没错。但我卖掉得太早了，这点代价就高了，我的头寸没错可时机掌握得不对。但是市场已经滑向没法遏制的崩盘状态，我只有等待，等价格不再下跌时，将那点保证金全拿出来卖掉股票。这一次我对了，因为只有那天一个机会，第二天就开始回稳，我就会再次上当。所以我就研究股票走势，回补空仓，等待着机会。时机到了，我就继续卖。而股市又一如既往下跌，不久又忽然涨起来。

股市好像要尽力把我打回在对赌行时期的那种传统又简单的交易形式中去，我首次做了个精确计划，不再只看一两种股票，而是注重整体股市。我觉得如果一直坚持就会赚钱。那时候，我还没有很全面的交易方法，不然我会像上次说的那样，在股市下跌时卖掉空头，也就不会丢掉保证金。我可能会出错，但不会有损失。你看，我已经看到了很多真相，但不知道怎么用。其实，我这种片面的观察不但没好处，还对我有所妨碍。

我觉得对自己所犯的错误进行反思，总能为自己带来好处，所以我发现在熊市时不失去空头头寸的确尽善尽美，不过，股市行情还是需要研究，这样才能找到合适的出击时机。一开始如果你对了，那么你就不会看到自己获利的头寸遭到严重威胁，然后你会发现，把头寸牢牢掌握住，也不是什么难事。

我如今对自己的观察判断很自信，期望和习惯都没影响到我的观察，而且我有了更多的工具，可以检验我看到的事实，并且用各种方式，测试我的观点是否正确。但是，1906年的那一连串的反弹的确差点让我损失了保证金。

那一年我27岁，已经有了12年炒股经验。我在首次利用即将到来的危机做生意时就发现，我一直在使用望远镜。从我第一次看到暴风雨即将来临的黑云，到靠着大崩盘获利之间，距离显然比我想象的远太多了，我甚至开始怀疑自己是否真的看到我认为我看得这么清楚的东西。我们有很多警讯，而且短期利率飞跃上升，有的经济师们还在满怀信心地发表评论，至少他们对记者这么说，而股市持续回稳揭穿了末日预言家的谎言。难道我一开始就看淡股市是个错误吗？还是因为卖得早了些而犯了暂时性的错误？

我觉得自己卖得有些早，可是我也没法控制。然后，股市又开始下跌，机会来了，我又全部卖掉，结果股票价格又反弹了，而且创造了纪录。

我被彻底清理出局了。

我做对了，却破产了。

告诉你吧，这事很让人吃惊，可事情就是这样：我看到前面有一大堆钱，旁边牌子上大字写着“请自取”。旁边有辆马车，车身上写着“劳伦斯·利文斯顿运输公司”。我拿着一把新铁铲，周围连一个人都没有，所以我在打算挖金矿时，没有竞争对手，这是比其他人先看到钱堆的好处。如果人们能停下来，就可以看到，但是他们或者在看棒球赛，或者在开车兜风，或者准备买大房子。这是我第一次看到这么多钱，我自然而然地朝它们奔去，可是我还没有到达，风就开始倒吹，我摔倒了。钱还在那里，可是我的铁铲丢了，那辆马车也不见了。这就是起跑早的结果。我太想确认我看到的是钱而不是幻觉了。我清楚地知道自己看到了，可只想着这个美妙的发现会带给我什么，却没考虑距离这堆钱多远。我应该走过去的，而不是快速奔过去。

这就是发生的一切。我迫不及待，没有停下来判定时机是否适于全力放空。在这样的情形下，我本该借助行情记录。如此，我学会了在熊市刚开始时，就算看淡后面的市场，也要确定会不会有引擎回火的风险，不然的话，就不要急着大量地卖掉。

多年来，我一直在哈丁兄弟公司交易股票，他们对我很信任，我们合作也很愉快。我觉得他们认为我必定会在短时期内卷土重来。他们清楚以我的运气，只需要一个开始，就能够复原得超过已经损失掉的头寸。他们从我身上挣了不少，也会继续挣得更多，所以只要我的信誉还好，在那里继续交易就不会有问题。

受到这一连串的打击，我已经不再那么自信了，或者说我该变得细心些，因为我已经在破产的边缘，可以做的只有慎重和等待。其实我在大赌之前就该这样，而不是亡羊补牢。下次开始时，我一定要搞清楚。如果一个人不出错，他在那一个月时间就可以拥抱世界，如果不吃一堑长一智，他绝对不能拥有什么好东西。

呵，先生们，一个晴朗的早上，我走到市中心，又觉得自己充满了信心。这一次没什么值得怀疑，我看到所有报纸的经济板块都刊登着一条告示，这又证明了我在出手前没理智等待。告示是北太平洋和北方铁路增发新股的广告。为了让股民更方便，采取的是分期付款的方式。这在华尔街还是很新鲜的东西，这对我不光是个不好的事情，还是个打击。

北方铁路这么多年一直保持着没有跌破面值，还宣布过又将有一股红利，包括持股人有平价购买北方铁路新增股票的权利。因为股价总是比面值高，所以这个权利非常珍贵。不过此时金融市场不景气，就算实力最强的银行也不能保证可以向股东支付现金购买这种便宜货。北方铁路股价是330美元左右。

我走进公司分部就对艾德·哈丁说：“现在是个好机会，卖吧，我该行动了，你看看那则广告。”

他早看过了。我按照自己的看法说了这个告示的含义，但是他不太能够看出我们随时面临着破产的危险。他觉得在大卖前还是等一等比较好，因为市场一般会先有大反弹，如果我等一等，价格可能比较低，但是操作会比较安全。

“艾德，”我说，“开始得越迟，开始后的崩溃就会越严重。那个告示代表的是银行家的立场，他们害怕的是我们想要的。这对我们而言，是熊市要来的征兆，这是我们想看到的。如果我有1000万，就会马上放进去。”

我必须要持续跟他争论，就一个健全的人而言，他对我从那个让人惊讶的广告做出的唯一推论不太满意。对我来说却够了，可对这里大多数人来说都不够。我卖掉了一些股票，可是太少了。

没过几天，圣保罗公司就很亲民地发布了一张发行新证券的告示，我忘了是股票还是权利证书了。不过不要紧，我已经看到上面的付款日期在之前宣布过的北太平洋和北方铁路公司缴款日期的前面。这么明显的事情，就像他们拿着话筒向那两条铁路股票发出了挑战，要抢华尔街所剩无几的现金。诚然，圣保罗公司的银行家们生怕华尔街的钱不够三家集资，但他们肯定不能说：“你先，你先，亲爱的伙计。”如果真的很缺钱，而且他们也都清楚，那么接下来会怎样？铁路公司缺钱却没钱，这会引发什么后果呢？

肯定是卖掉股票啊！大家在那一周都紧盯股市，但基本上看不出什么情况，聪明的操控者却在那时候明白了很多事情，这就是差别。

而在我看来，是该结束优柔寡断的时候了，我当即就下了决心。就在那天早上，我真正根据此后我所遵循的路线，打我的第一场战役。我对哈丁谈了我的看法和决定。我准备按照330美元的价格卖掉北方铁路股票，用更高的价格卖掉其他股票，哈丁没有反对。我从之前受到的教训里获得了很多经验，所以卖的时候很讲究策略。

不管是不是偶然，反正我很快就恢复了名声和信誉，在证券商那里做出正确判断真不错。这次我完全没错，因为我是在分析了股市的影响因素后得出的结果，而不是靠感觉和行情记录。我不是在猜测，而是在预测无可避免的状况。想卖股票并不需要鼓足多少勇气，除了股价在下跌外，我根本看不出会发生任何其他状况，我必须根据这点行动，对不对？除此之外，我还能做其他事情吗？

整个股市行情都很疲软，不久之后就会出现反弹，很多人过来对我说，已经跌到了不能再跌的地步。大玩家们中间有很多卖空的人，他们想通过卖空赚大钱，这事很有把握又容易，他们是不会心慈手软的。通常我会感谢他们，甚至不跟他们争论，生怕他们觉得我对他们的建议没有感恩之心。

跟我一起在亚特兰大待过的朋友现在很焦灼，经历了那次地震后，他开始对我的预感深信不疑，因为我靠着感觉卖掉了太平洋铁路的股票，赚了25万。他甚至把这一切都归功于上帝。他对我在萨拉托加玩的那一次也很理解，因为只要与股票有关的交易，他都能理解。个股的消息确实会事前对股市产生影响，可这种说整个股市都会下滑的事情，又让他很愤慨。这样的消息对人们有什么好呢？人们怎么知道该怎么办呢？

这些让我想起了帕特里奇的那句口头禅：“好了，你晓得，现在是牛市。”似乎这就是真实情况，对很多聪明人而言，这好像就够了。可对那些刚经历过失败，损失了15点、20点还坚守着的人来说，看到回升了3个点，就深信到了底线，马上要上涨了。

有一天，朋友来问我：“你平仓了没？”

我说：“我为什么要平仓？”

“你有这个世上最好的理由啊。”

“什么理由？”

“赚钱，已经跌到底了，接下来必定上涨，难道不是吗？”

“是啊。”我说，“只有到底了，才会上涨，可不会马上就涨，中间会反复涨跌好多天。现在还不到涨的时候，它还没有跌到底呢。”

一位记性很好的老友听到我的话，他是那种总是想到某些事情的人。他说，有一次威廉·斯格特觉得股市会下跌，他遇到了一位认为会上涨的人，二人就讨论起来。那人说：“现在股市这么坚挺，为什么你觉得会下跌呢？”斯格特不屑地说：“是啊，像个死人那样硬挺挺的。”斯格特到过一家公司，他要求看一下报表，职员问他：“你持有我们公司的股份吗？”斯格特说：“我应该说，我卖掉了你们的2万股。”

反弹越来越无力，我尽力抛空股票，每次我卖出北方铁路几千股时，价格就会跌几个点。我觉得其他几只股票也比较疲软，就卖掉了些，它们都在跌。只有一家股票让人惊讶，它就是里丁公司。

所有股票都在下跌，只有里丁公司股票却像直布罗陀海峡的礁石一般纹丝不动。大家都说这只股票被人垄断囤积着，迹象表明就是这样。人们对我说，卖空里丁公司的股票简直是自杀。交易大厅里也有跟我一样看淡股市的其他人，可要是有人建议他们卖掉里丁的股票，他们就会紧张地喊救命。我已经卖掉了些里丁公司的股票，也自然想寻找其他可以出手的地方，而避开坚不可摧的地方。通过观察我找到了几个比较容易赚钱的股票。

关于里丁公司背后的基金集团，我听过很多种说法，那可是个很强大的集团。朋友说，他们握着很多低价时候买进的股票，平均持股的价格比现行价要低。此外，这个集团的主要成员与一些银行之间有非常扎实的关系，正是利用那些银行的钱，他们才把大量里丁公司的股票收进手中。价格只要不下滑，他们与银行之间的关系就牢不可破。其中一个成员有300多万的账面浮动利润，完全可以承受住一定程度的下跌，他们手中的股票是可以对抗大量空头的。股民们经常会看着股价，舔着嘴唇，拿出一两千股试探一下市场，可是没法压低这只股票的价格，只好平仓后去其他地方赚些容易赚的钱。不管什么时候，我看到这只股票，也会多卖些，卖到刚好足够让我自己相信，我确实是遵照新的交易原则行事，而不是操作喜欢的股票。

以前，里丁公司或许耍过我，行情单不断透漏这个意思：“不要理这只股票。”我却感觉不是这样，我觉得会出现一次整体的滑坡，不管是有钱没钱，谁都逃不掉。

我喜欢单枪匹马行事，跟在对赌行时期一样，以后还会这样，我就是这样的思维方式。我必须自己研究和思考，但是我可以对你讲，股市开始照我的方向走的时候，我首次觉得自己在这个世界上有了一个真诚的好伙伴，那就是股市基本行情。它们不遗余力地帮我，虽然有时候反映情势的速度特别慢，但是只要我愿意等待，它们总是很可靠。我这不是在用感觉和分析股市行情的小伎俩对抗时机，而是利用逻辑分析来赚钱。

重要的是要正确无误，知道自己正确，并且付诸行动。总体行情——我真正的盟友，它说：“下跌了！”可里丁却不管这个，它可是在欺负我们。看着里丁公司股份坚挺不动，好像什么都没发生，我开始生气。因为还没下跌，所以它是股市里可以放空的最好股票。而且他们集团手里握着一大把股票，如果资金一直缺乏的话，他们就没办法一直这样持有下去。总有那么一天，银行的人不会比我们这些普通人好到哪里去，这只股票会跟其他股票一样下跌。如果里丁公司的股票不下跌的话，那么我的这套理论就是错误的，我是错误的，事实是错误的，逻辑也是错误的。

我估计是人们都不愿意卖掉，所以股价一直不跌。所以，有一天，我向两个经纪人各自发了一张要卖掉4000股的单子。

你该瞧瞧这只垄断股，如果放空的话，就等于自杀。可是我这样的做法还是对它造成了冲击，它也开始下跌了，我就又卖掉了几千股，我卖的时候股价是111美元，没过多久我就按照92美元，回补了这只股票的空头。

自此以后，我的日子就好起来了。1907年2月，我把所有的空头都回补到位。那时候北方铁路的股票下跌了六七十点，其他的股票也在跌。我赚了一大笔，可是我之所以全部回补，是因为觉得股市行情反映了近期的情况。我觉得股价会猛烈回升，但我也没那么大信心认为需要转变操作方向。我还不想完全改变我的做法，市场也不允许我马上就交易。我在对赌行的时候，赔了我第一次赚的1万美元的原因，正是我没有在乎时机是否成熟，天天买进卖出。这样的错误我不会再犯。而且别忘了，不久前我才赔得惨不忍睹，就是因为我提前就预估到了会大跌，可不到时候就卖掉了很多。如今，我已经赚了大钱，希望获利落袋为安，好让自己觉得正确。以前反弹曾经导致我大赔，我可不能再被它洗劫一空。我没有让自己闲着，而是到了佛罗里达。我热爱钓鱼，也需要休息。在那里我就可以一边钓鱼一边休息。另外，华尔街与棕榈滩之间有直通线路。





第九章


我在佛罗里达州的外海航行，这里是钓鱼的好地方。我已经出脱股票，心情轻松自在，过得非常惬意。有一天，几个朋友驾驶摩托艇，来到棕榈滩海上玩。有人带了一张报纸。那些日子我没看过报纸，不管哪方面的内容，我都不想看。可是我瞄了一眼朋友带来的报纸后，发现股市上涨了十来个点。

我对朋友说：“我要跟你们一起上岸。”偶尔来个适度的反弹很正常，可此时还是熊市，华尔街上或愚蠢或绝望的股民们却不管资金情况，把价格抬高到合理范围之外，或是纵容某些人这样做。对我来说，这样太过分了。我必须得看看股市了，我不知道自己能干什么，或者不干什么，但我明白我最需要的是看看股市报价。

哈丁兄弟公司在棕榈滩也有个分部，我走进去时看到了很多认识的人。他们很多人都在议论说很看好市场。他们都是一些仅仅凭着行情报价玩股票的人，总想着快速交易。这样的股民没多少长远的眼光，他们的玩法也的确不需要这样的眼光。我说过，我是怎么在纽约获得“投机分子”这个称号的。当然了，通常情况下，人们喜欢把他人获利和炒股的事实夸大。这里的人听说我在纽约的时候通过做空赚了很多钱，此刻他们还是想让我再那样笃信一把空头。他们自己认为反弹还会持续一段时间，可同时又认为对抗反弹是我的责任。

我本来是来佛罗里达钓鱼的，前一阵子我承受了很大压力，我需要度个假。可当我知道价格反弹不少的那时候，一下子感觉不需要度假了。我上岸时没有想到要做什么，但是现在我知道我要赶紧放空股票。我是对的，必须要用我唯一的老方法，用钱来验证我的判断是否正确。把股票全部卖掉，这是一种慎重、有效而且可以说是爱国的行为。

我通过报价牌首先看到的是安纳康达公司的股票马上要突破300个点，简直是飞跃上涨，而且里面肯定有个很猛的团队在操控。有一条传统的交易规则：当股票首次突破100、200或300点的时候，价格不会停滞不前，而是会继续上涨很多，所以当它在突破重要关卡的时候，你马上买，必定会赚一笔。胆子小的人不爱在股价创新高纪录的时候买进，可是我却有这种股价波动的“史实”来指导我。

安纳康达是所谓的四分之一股票，也就是面值只有25美元的小额股，它的400股相当于100股的普通股票的面值，我估计到了300点后，它还会继续上涨，很快就会到340美元。

不要忘了，我还是很看淡后市的，可是我也是个能靠行情走势玩股票的人。我清楚安纳康达若能按照我的估计发展，就会很快地波动。不管多快，都吸引着我。我已经培养了耐心，知道了怎么样自我坚持，可我还是更喜欢快速行动。安纳康达绝对不是牛皮股，我在它突破300点的时候买入，是因为我想证实自己的观察，我这种意愿总是很强烈。

那时，买的人比卖的人多，所以股市上涨的情形会持续下去，因此观察一段时间后再卖空比较适宜。对我来说，等一等也会有所收获的，我可以从安纳康这只股票中迅速赚取30点，我看空整个股市，却看好这一只股票。所以我买了3.2万股安纳康达，相当于8000股整股。这只股票是一只很好的小型投机股，我相信自己的推断，而且我还觉得，这一次赚的钱或许能够增强我的保证金实力，为我以后放空打下基础。

第二天，因为受到北边暴风雨或者其他因素的影响，电报中断了。我在哈丁公司坐等消息。大家都在闲聊，猜测着股市行情。股票投资人不能交易时总是这样做。后来我们等到了那天唯一的一次报价，安纳康达是292。

当时有个我在纽约认识的人跟我在一起，他清楚我做多了8000股。当听到报价的时候，他也吃了一惊，所以我觉得他手里也有些安纳康达的股票。他没法判断，那时股票是否会再跌十几个点。按照安纳康达之前上涨的走势，现在跌个20点以上应该也有可能。可是我还是对他说：“约翰，不要担心，明天就没事了。”我确实是这么感觉的，可是他盯着我直摇头，他就是这样的人，自认为自己更懂一些。我哈哈大笑起来，然后继续等着股市报价，可是再也没有报价传回来。我们得到的唯一报价是，安纳康达是292美元。这表示我赔了10万美元。我想要迅速行动，我罪有应得。

隔天后，电报线路恢复了，我们跟以往一样看到了报价，安纳康达的开盘价是298美元，后来涨到了302又3/4，不过没多久又下跌了。而其他的股票也没有进一步上涨的迹象，我下定决心，如果安纳康达的股票如果回到301，我必须将整个事件看作是一种假象。按照正常情况，它应该能够涨到310才对啊。假如股价反而下跌就表示前例欺骗了我，我出错了。出错的人唯一可做的就是及时改正错误。我买了足足8000股，希望能上涨个三四十点，这不是我第一次也不会是最后一次出错。

安纳康达又跌到了301。一跌到这个价位，我就悄悄跑到电报员身边。他们可以直接跟纽约联系，所以我对他说：“把我那整整8000股的安纳康达股卖掉吧，全部卖掉。”我小声说话，生怕被别人知道我的行动。

他抬头看着我，一脸惊恐的样子，我点着头说：“全部卖！”

“利文斯顿先生，你肯定不是说用市价交易吧？”他的样子好像是因为营业员执行错误，自己亏好几百万美元一样。

不过我还是说：“卖！什么也别说了。”

此时，布莱克兄弟、吉姆、奥利弗都在交易大厅，他们没听到我和电报员说话。他们原来都是芝加哥有名的小麦期货商人，如今又是纽约很有地位的股票商人，他们特别有钱，是股票大作手。

当我回到报价牌前的座位上时，奥利弗·布莱克一边笑一边冲我点头。

“你会后悔。”他说。

“你什么意思？”我停下来问。

“明天你就得买回来。”

“买什么？”我问。除了那个电报员，我可没对任何人说过。

“安纳康达股票。”他说，“你要用320美元买，你这做法可不明智啊。”他笑着。

“什么做法不明智啊？”我似乎一脸茫然地问。

“你卖掉你的8000股安纳康达，而且那么坚定。”布莱克说。

我清楚谁都认为他特别精明，他经常根据内幕消息炒股，可我没想到，他居然知道我的交易，我深信公司没有出卖我。

“奥利弗，你怎么知道的？”我问。

他哈哈大笑着，对我说：“是查理·克里特斯说的。”他指的正是那个电报员。

“可他连动都没动啊。”我说。

“我不知道你们在说什么。”他微笑着说，“可是他发电报的时候，我可是听清楚了所有的内容。几年之前，别人给我发电报时搞错了一句话，我就开始学习电报密码了。我在像你刚才那样告诉电报员指令的时候，我要确定，他是不是搞对了，他发的内容可得是我的想法啊。你卖掉了安纳康达股票，一定会追悔莫及，它能涨到500美元。”

“这次可不会，奥利弗。”我说道。

他盯着我：“你这么自信啊？”

“不是我自信，股市行情就是这样。”我说。实际上那儿并没有接收股市行情的收报机，不过他知道我在说什么。

他说：“我听说有一些家伙，就算看了行情记录，也看不明白价格，反而像看列车时刻表一样，只能看到股票到站和离站的时间。不过幸好他们都已经住在精神病院的小房子里了，四壁都是软垫，他们不会伤着自己了。”

我不理会他，因为电报员这时给我送来了一个单子，他们已经按照299又3/4的价格卖掉了我的5000股。我清楚这里的报价很滞后，我告诉电报员的时候，棕榈滩报价牌上还是301块。我确信，纽交所正在卖的股票的实价比这还要低，所以要是那时有人花296买我的股票，我会高兴坏的。这些过程都说明，我从不限价交易是多么正确。如果我把卖出的价格限定到300以上，肯定卖不出去。好吧，先生们，如果你们有了平仓的想法就一定要出手迅速，时不我待啊。

如今，我买股票的价格差不多是300，他们用299又3/4卖了整整500股整股，用299又5/8的价格卖了1000股，然后以299又1/2卖掉100股，以299又3/8和299又1/4的价格分别卖掉200股，剩下的按照298又3/4卖了。在抛售最后100股时，哈丁兄弟公司里最厉害的经纪人花了十五分钟才卖掉，他们不想把股价砸下去。

我拿到最后这部分股票售出的单子后，就开始做真正促使我上岸的事情，也就是放空股票，我一定得这样做，市场经过离奇的反弹后，哀求大家放空。人们又在说很看好股市。我却觉得股市上涨已经到头了，做空是安全的，没什么可考虑的。

次日，安纳康达股票的开盘价比296还低，奥利弗·布莱克本想着它会继续上涨，很早就来瞧着。我不清楚他到底是不是做了多头，到底做了多少，可是当他看到开盘价时，就再也没法笑了。晚些时候，它还在下跌。我们后来听说交易所里已经没人买那只股票了。

当然，任何人都需要这样的证明。我的账面利润不停地提醒着我，我没做错。我自然又多放空了一些。放空一切股票！熊市的时候，各种股票都在下跌。第二天是周五，华盛顿诞辰纪念日。我不能再在佛罗里达州钓鱼了，我做了一大笔空头。有人需要我坚守纽约，这人是谁？自然就是我本人。棕榈滩又远又偏，光发电报就能浪费大量珍贵时间。

我从棕榈滩返回纽约，周一必须要在圣奥古斯丁等上三个小时的火车，那里有个经纪行，我自然要利用这点时间去看看股市走向。从上一个交易日到现在，安纳康达股票又下跌了好多点。事实上它一直都在跌，直到那年秋天的暴跌为止。

到达纽约后，我做了差不多四个月的空头。股市跟以往一样来回反弹，我只能跟着平仓和放空。严格来讲，我不是抓着头寸纹丝不动。不要忘了，我在旧金山地震那次赚到的30万全部折了进去，本以为不会出错，可还是差点完蛋。我现在的做法非常小心，人在逆境中走过，就会很喜欢顺境中的感觉，即使他还没有攀到最高山峰。赚钱的方法就是去赚钱，而想赚大钱，就要选择恰到好处的正确时机。身处这个行业，就要将理论和实际结合起来，不能只是光会投机，而要既做好学生也要做好投机人。

我当时做得还是很好的，虽然现在我感觉那时的做法有很多不完美的地方。夏天到了的时候，股市萧条了，看样子只有在秋天才能变好。我认识的很多人都去了欧洲，有的准备要去。我觉得这是个好计划，所以我也平了仓。我乘船前往欧洲时，一共赚了75万，这对我而言是笔非常大的财富。

我在法国埃克斯莱班愉快地游玩，反正已经赚了足够游玩的钱。能在一个好地方，有钱有朋友，一起铁了心快活一场，简直是一件特别爽的事，而埃克斯莱班就具备这些条件。远离华尔街，我差不多都要忘记它了，这一点我认为胜过美国任何一个度假胜地。我不需要再去与股市打交道，不需要交易，我赚的钱完全够我用上很久。而且，我也知道回去后该怎么赚钱，肯定会赚得比在欧洲花费的要多很多。

有一天，我在《巴黎先锋报》上看到了一条发自纽约的消息，炼铁公司宣布要发放一笔额外股利，他们的股票也已经上涨了，整体股市行情也很不错，而这也就影响了我在埃克斯莱班的计划。这个消息说明多头集团仍在绝望地和大势对抗，他们在跟常识和诚实顽抗，因为他们很清楚要发生什么事情，所以要借势在股市风暴侵袭他们之前把股票倒出来。可能他们不觉得股市会有我估计的那么急迫和严重，华尔街的要人们总像政客一般靠臆想做事。但是我却不能这么做，这对股民来说是很危险的事情。或许也有那种不怕身陷泥潭的人。

以我的了解，一切在熊市中想通过操纵提升股价的炒股行为都会失败。看到那条消息后，我觉得只有一件事能做得称心愉快，就是把炼铁公司的股票放空。在股市资金出现问题的时候，那些人还在提高配股比率，这就像他们在跪下求我放空一样。这种事情就像你小时候，有人找你挑战一样让你生气。他们挑战我放空这只股票。

我卖掉了一些炼铁公司的股票，还让我在纽约的朋友们也做空头。经纪人把单子给我的时候，我看到上面的股价比我在《巴黎先锋报》上看到的还低6个点，这足以说明实情了。

我原计划月底去巴黎，过三周后再回纽约，可当我拿到经纪人的单子后，当天就去了巴黎。到达巴黎的同一天，我向客船公司打电话咨询，第二天就有去纽约的快船，于是我订了船票。

就这样，我比原计划提前一个月回到了纽约，这里才是适合我放空股票的地方。我有大概50多万的保证金，我回来不是因为不看好后市，而是因为我是个讲理的人。

我又放空了很多股票。股市的资金越发紧俏了，短期贷款的利率也变高了，与之相应的是股价越来越低。我早就预感到是这样。一开始，我的判断害过我，可现在我成功了。不过，正儿八经的快乐是，我觉得身为一个炒股手，自己终于走对了路。我还有很多东西要学，但是我知道要怎么做。我不再犯错，再不会采用烂办法。在这个游戏中，分析行情是非常重要的。在适当的时候出手，坚持头寸也特别重要。但是我最重要的发现是，必须要全面研究所有因素，考量自己的所作所为，以便预估接下来可能发生的状况。总之，我学会了为钱工作。我不会再去鲁莽地下赌注，也不再关心如何掌握操作技巧，我通过钻研和深思熟虑获得了成功。我还发现，谁也不能免于犯下愚蠢的操作失误的危险。一个人操作愚蠢，就要为愚蠢付出代价。

我在股票公司赚了很多钱，我玩得很成功，成了人们平日的谈资，不过是经过夸大的。他们把很多只股票的崩跌都归功于我。不知道姓名的人也来向我表示祝贺。他们都认为最神奇的是我赚了那么多钱，却只字不提我第一次跟他们谈到熊市快来了时，他们都认为我是疯狂的空头，是在亏损之后恶意地发牢骚。在他们眼里，我预估到股市资金链断裂不值一提。他们认为，对他们来说，我的经纪商的会计用了三分之一滴的墨水，才在账簿的贷方写完我名下的获利，是惊人的成就。

过去，朋友们常常跟我讲，在很多股票公司里，人们都在议论着哈丁兄弟公司的投机分子狙击了想要抬高股价的多头集团——他们在情势很明显，股市一定会在比较低的水准寻求支撑的情形之后很久，还设法抬高很多种股票的价格。一直到今天，他们还在谈论我的几次掼压行动。

从9月下旬开始，资金市场就向全世界发出了警讯，可是大家都相信会有奇迹出现，不愿卖掉手中的股票。当有个经纪人对我说起发生在10月第一周的一件事时，我几乎对自己的不紧不慢感到羞愧了。

你还记得吧，以前资金贷款是在交易大厅的货币池完成的。经纪人收到银行的通知，说头寸需要多少钱，就知道还需要借款多少。当然，银行也知道这个。可以提供贷款的人会把钱拿到交易所，由几个经纪人处理。他们主要营生的方式就是放贷。一般快中午的时候，当天的新利率就会公布，差不多就是当时贷款利率的平均值。生意还能通过公开投标达成，谁都可以知道进展。一般情况下，从中午到下午两点的交易很少，不过过了交割时间两点一刻后，经纪人就能知晓当天准确的现金头寸，他们可以去货币池借贷需要的钱。这些通常都公开进行。

10月上旬的一天，我提到过的那位经纪人来找我，说他们都很生气，有钱都不想去货币池，因为几个大证券商总在那儿盯着，看到谁拿出钱就会围过去。当然没有一个公开做放款业务的人能够拒绝这些机构。他们要是有偿还能力和抵押品倒是好说了，问题是一旦他们打电话来借钱，这些钱就打了水漂。他们只要说一句没钱还，不管借钱的人是否情愿，都得继续借。所以，股票交易所想借钱给熟悉的人，一般会派人悄悄对他说：“需要100美元吗？”代表的含意是：“想借10万吗？”银行的资金经纪人也用这样的办法。你想想吧，货币池的情形真的是一片凄惨。

他告诉我说10月的那些日子股票交易所规定借钱的人可以自己确定利率，这已经成了证券交易所的习惯。你看，年利率一直在百分之百到百分之一百五十之间动荡。我觉得让借钱的人自己定利率，放贷人不会让人觉得自己就是个高利贷主，可他一分钱都不会少拿。债主也自然不想要高利息。他只要钱，钱能到手就很好。

情况变得越来越不像话了，最终到了一发不可收拾的地步，无论乐观与否，起初没胆量承受小损失，现在终于没办法控制了。虽然他们也怕赔本，可是大多数人都没有避开血本无归的痛苦。我会永远记住这个日子：1907年10月24日。

从一大帮要借钱的人那里传出来的消息，很早就显示借方愿意付出贷方认为应该要的利率。没有足够的钱来运转，那天的人比平时多出了好多。交割时间刚到，已有一百多人在交易池等着，他们都想借款救急。如果没钱，他们就得按照市场上的价格把股票卖掉，不计价格，因为买主像资金一样稀少——那个时候连一美元都难以寻到。

朋友的合作者们和我一样，不看好后市，公司也用不着去借钱。可我提到过的那位经纪人朋友，终于一脸憔悴地从交易池里摆脱了，他来到我这里。他清楚我有很多空头头寸。

他说：“老天爷啊，我不清楚到底怎么了，从来没见过这样的情况。不能这样下去了，这还了得，我感觉现在就有人已经破产了。你卖不出股票，现在市场上一分钱都很难找到。”

“你说的什么意思啊？”我问。

他回答道：“你听过这样一个实验吗？把一只老鼠放到一个玻璃器皿中，再把空气抽掉。你能看到老鼠的呼吸不断减弱，小身体两边就像风箱一样呼哧呼哧，真是可怜。它使劲儿地从玻璃器皿中获得稀少的空气。你能看到它喘不上气来，眼睛都要从眼眶里跳出来了，慢慢地喘息着死掉。唉，我看到资金交易池的那些人时，觉得他们就是老鼠。哪里都没有资金，也没人买股票，他就没法交易股票。如果你问我华尔街现在的状况，我会说这个时候它已经病入膏肓了。”

这种情形让我顿时沉思起来，我预测到会崩盘，可我承认没有预测到我们国家有史以来最严重的一次资本恐慌。这样继续下去的话，对谁都是莫大的损害。

事情已经明摆着了，再等下去也起不了什么作用，地狱正在召唤他们。

后来，我听说股票交易所总经理托马斯知道大家头顶都悬着一把剑，都在到处寻求帮助，于是他去拜访了全美国最有实力的银行——国家城市银行的行长詹姆斯·斯蒂尔曼，他曾经自豪地说过，他们的贷款利率从来没高出过百分之六。

斯蒂尔曼听托马斯讲明情况后说：“托马斯先生，我们必须要去跟摩根先生说说这个问题。”

他们都希望能够为有史以来最严重的这次金融事件努力做点事情，于是他们到了摩根的办公室。托马斯刚向摩根讲述问题的严重性，摩根先生就说：“回去吧，对他们说，钱会有的。”

“在哪里？”

“在银行里。”

这种危机四伏的时候，谁都对摩根先生充满信任，所以托马斯没再继续查问详情，就直接折回了交易大厅，向已经被判了死刑的老伙计们宣布缓刑。

接着在下午两点半之前，摩根派来了范恩·埃德波公司的埃德波来交易厅，谁都知道他和摩根关系密切。我朋友说，这个老经纪人快步来到交易池跟前，像复兴大会上规劝迷途者恢复信仰一般，高举着手。之前从托马斯那里得到消息的人们本来已经平静了，现在又开始担心计划泡汤，发生更糟糕的事情。他们盯着埃德波的脸，看到他举起了手，就都僵在了那里。

在无声的沉寂中，埃德波说：“我有给你们贷款1000万的权力，大家轻松点，谁都会有钱的。”

接着，他就开始了操作。他没有把放款人的名字告诉要贷款的人，而是简单记下了贷款人的姓名和所需资金，然后对他们说：“等着人通知你们去哪里拿钱。”意思是，稍后贷款人就可以去放款的银行拿钱。

据说过了一两天，摩根先生对那些担惊受怕的银行家们说，一定要向股票交易所提供需要的资金。

“可是我们没有钱啊，钱早就全部放出去了。”

摩根正色言道：“储备金呢？”

“这已经比法定限额都低了。”他们悲戚地说。

“用啊！储备金的用处就在这里。”

银行答应了，拿出了2000万左右的储备金，挽救了即将崩溃的市场。摩根先生是个很了不起的勇士，银行到现在也没有什么长进。

这一天，是我炒股以来印象最深刻的一天，也是这一天，我赚了100万美元。这说明，我第一次经过精心布局的交易最终成功了，我之前预料的结果也出现了。不过更重要的是，我实现了一个狂妄的梦想，做了一天国王。

需要说明的是，我在纽约待了几年，常会深入思考，为什么不可以像15岁在波士顿对赌行时一样，也在纽约股票市场上游刃有余地掌控一切呢。我清楚自己有搞明白的一天，然后就不会再犯错。那时候，我不光想做正确的事情，而且还有能做正确事情的资本，这就意味着权力。

请不要误会，这不是个毫无节制的大梦想，也不是因为虚荣心而妄想，只是我的感觉而已。我认为曾经在富勒顿公司和哈丁兄弟公司把我打垮过的股市，终有一天会匍匐在我的脚下，那一天一定会到来。这一天真的来了——1907年10月24日。

我之所以这么说，是因为那天早晨，一个与我有过长期合作，也清楚我一直做空头的经纪人和华尔街一家最著名的银行合伙人同车。他对这位银行家说，我这些年的交易量一直非常巨大，因为我确实在尽我最大的力量去赌博。

或许那个经纪人言过其实，好让他的故事听起来特别重要，也或许我有很多自己都不知道的粉丝，再或者这位银行家比我更清楚问题的严重性，总之我朋友对我说：“我对他说，你觉得再推动一两下，真正的股票销售期到来时，市场会怎么变化。他听得特别认真，我说完后，他还说稍晚一点儿的时候要找我办事。”

当证券商人们发现，用任何贷价都没法弄来一分钱时，我清楚时机到了。我把经纪人指派到了各处。老天，有段时间太平洋铁路公司的股票没有一张买单，不管什么价格！你想想吧，其他股票也都是这样。没有资金可以支撑股票，也没人愿意买进。

我的账面利润很惊人，而且我很清楚，要想撼动股价，要做的就是卖出股票。我卖出太平洋和其他六家股息较好的公司各1万的股票，随之而来的一定是哀鸿遍野。我认为，马上要出现的股市恐慌会很惨烈，甚至政府都会产生要关闭交易所的想法，就像1914年8月世界大战时一样。

这正好说明我的浮动利润要大幅度上涨了。

不过，要想把利润换成现金，也是没什么可能。不过还是要考虑其他事，其中之一是股票一直下跌，会对刚恢复的市场产生影响，从全局来看，这样的股市恐慌对整个国家都会产生损害。

我决定，既然再这么热心地做空是不聪明的做法，而且也不好玩，那么我如果继续做空就违反逻辑了，所以我转向开始买入。

经纪人替我以很低的价格买入股票没多久，银行就把我朋友叫去了。

“我让人喊你过来，”他说，“目的是想让你赶紧去找你朋友利文斯顿，对他说，我们希望他今天不要再卖出任何股票，市场的压力已经很大了。要扭转这次股市恐慌的确不是一件容易的事情。把你朋友的爱国热情激发出来吧，面对这样的局面，人一定要照顾大局，他有什么说法一定要第一时间告诉我。”

我朋友立刻就来找我了，他很讲究技巧。我想他可能觉得我既然计划击垮股市，应该会把他提出的要求看作是放弃赚1000万的机会。他同时也明白，那些人跟我一样都知道会出现什么情况，却还使劲儿把股票卖给大家，这是让人很不齿的事情。

其实，那些股票大户才是受害最严重的人，我用很低的价格买到的股票都是很有名的公司，当时我却不知道，可也没什么，我已经差不多平了所有空头。我觉得既有机会买了便宜股票，若没有人去打压股市的话，我还帮忙恢复了股价。

所以我对朋友说：“你去告诉银行的人，我答应了。我在他找你之前就明白，这件事的意义非同寻常。我不光今天不卖了，而且还要想办法买入些。”我信守了承诺，当天就买了10万股，还是多头。此后的九个月里，我都没再抛出股票。

这就是为什么我对朋友说，我的梦想实现了，做了一天国王的原因。那天的某段时间，股市确实是处于任人蹂躏的状态。我没有幻想自己很伟大，其实你知道的，我很明白人们指责我袭击股市时，以及华尔街传播我如何神乎其技时，是种什么感觉。

我没有受到一点儿损伤就脱身了，报纸上炒作说利文斯顿这个“投机分子”赚了几百万。呵呵，我在那天收市前赚了差不多100万，可我最大的获利不是这个，而是看不到的收获：我是对的，我预估了未来，并且策划周密。我学到要想赚大钱必须要做的事情，我彻底与赌博划清了界限，终于学会了怎么利用智商做大手笔的生意。这是我一生中最重要的日子。





第十章


我们认识到错误，应该不会比研究自己为什么成功更有好处。大家自然都不想受到错误的惩罚，当犯错带来恶果后，谁也不想重蹈覆辙，来自股市的错误会对你造成财产和自尊上的双重伤害。不过我要告诉你一些奇怪的现象：有时候交易商们做错事情的时候，是心知肚明的。他们出错后会自问原因，当后果带来的痛苦烟消云散后，思考良久，他们就有可能搞明白，自己什么时候、在哪里、怎么样出了错，可他不会知道出错的原因，只会骂自己一句，然后就放过了。

当然，如果一个人既聪明又运气比较好，就不会在同一条道上摔倒两次，可其他那么多类似的错误保不齐就会犯。世界上的错真是太多，当你每次想知道自己会不会出错时，可能有个错就悄悄守在你身边。

要告诉你我的第一个百万美元的错误，就得从1907年10月我第一次成为百万富翁后开始说。以我的交易而言，一百万只是说明我多了点保证金。金钱本身不会给股民带来更多的舒适，因为不管贫穷还是富有，都会出错，这是让人永远不爽的事情。当事情做对的时候，金钱只是个工具。赔钱对我也始终没产生过困扰，过上一天我就会忘掉。若做错了事情而不愿意接受所受的亏损，那就不光是金钱的损失了，心灵也会受到伤害。你还记得迪克森·华兹讲过的一件小事吧。有个人特别紧张，朋友问他到底怎么了。

他说：“我总失眠。”

朋友问原因，他说：“我的棉花期货的头寸特别大，想想就难以入睡，我被折腾得筋疲力尽。我该怎么办？”

朋友劝他：“卖掉吧，让你的头寸少到你能睡踏实的程度。”

一般而言，人是很能适应环境而丧失洞察能力的动物。他察觉不到有多大区别，就是说，他基本上不可能想起还没成为百万富翁的时候自己是什么感觉了，而只知道一些当时做不了，现在却可以做的事情。年轻、正常、理智的人由俭入奢易，由奢入俭难。我觉得原因是金钱会挑起人的欲望，人们总是多少抱着多多益善的观念。意思是说，当有人从股市赚了钱后，很快就纸醉金迷了，可一旦他又没钱了，要改掉大手大脚的习惯，就得花很长时间。

1907年10月，我不再做空而是开始做多。我计划先放松一下，于是就买了一艘游艇，想去南边的海域游玩一趟。我特别喜欢钓鱼，总想着要好好钓一场鱼，也盼望有实现的那一天，可股市却总不能让我如愿。

一直以来，我既进行股票交易，也玩商品期货。年轻的时候，我就开始在对赌行做期货交易了。这些年来，我一直在研究期货市场，只不过不像对股市那样上心。其实相比较的话，我更偏向做期货，不是因为它看起来更正统，虽然确实如此，可它也具备更高的风险。用一个假设的理由来反对或者支持期货市场的价格走向，即便成功也是短暂的，最后还是事实得到胜利。所以，就像做其他普通生意一样，交易商们总是靠研究和观察得到报酬。他可以观察和考虑各种情况，而且可以跟别人知道的一样多。他不用跟幕后集团做斗争。在棉花、小麦、玉米期货市场上，没有红利分配这一说法。长久以来，商品价格只受一种法则主导——供需的经济法则。玩期货的人只要知道供求状态、现况和趋势就行，不用像炒股一样对很多事情做预估，所以期货对我的吸引力更大。

所有的投机市场都有相同点，行情走势的分析技巧是一样的。对于所有热衷于思考的人而言，这一点非常清楚。如果人多问自己几个为什么，对各个因素考虑明白，答案就直接出来了。可是人们总是懒于发问，更不用说找答案了。一般美国人生性多疑，而且任何时候都是这样，只有到经纪商那里看盘的时候例外，不管看的是股票还是商品。在所有的游戏当中，玩之前真正需要研究的一种游戏，刚好就是美国人没有利用平常惯有的高度警觉和极为聪明的准备就投身其中的游戏。有的人拿出自己的一半身家去冒险时，花在思考上的时间还没买一辆车时考虑的时间长。

分析行情并没那么难。当然这需要经验，但是更需要的是在心里记住一些基本要素。分析情势并不是为了知道运气好不好，它可不会对你说下周四下午一点三十五你会有多少钱。分析行情是为了如何交易和什么时候交易——也就是说，应该买还是卖，这些对股票、棉花、小麦和玉米都一样有效。

你观察市场自然是依靠行情记录机显示的价格情况，目的只有一个，就是确定方向，即价格走向。我们知道，价格会根据实际情况上涨或者下跌。为了简单解释清楚，我们把价格看作跟其他东西一样，在沿着最小阻力线变化。它们通常是怎么变化容易就会怎么变，所以当上涨阻力小于下跌阻力时，价格就会上涨，反过来也一样。

如果股市开局很稳，后面不管牛市还是熊市，都不应该感到困惑。对一个思维敏捷并很有眼光的人而言，趋势很明显。对于投机客来说，总想着拿理论往事实身上死套，是很愚蠢的。清楚了是牛市还是熊市，就知道了该买还是该卖。人就应该在市场一开始就判断出走向。

比如，假设市场一如既往地起起伏伏，波动在10个点内，最高能涨到130，最低跌到120。可能当它快跌到支撑点120时，就会劲力不足而显得疲软。或者在上涨8个点或10个点的路上，看起来特别强劲。你不应该根据某些简单迹象就贸然行动，而是应该根据行情记录来判断时机是否已到。其实人们因为价格看起来便宜就买，或是因为价格看起来贵就卖，已经损失了几千万美元。投机的人跟投资的人不一样，他不是为了得到稳定回报，而是在价格的上下变动中谋取利益。所以他需要确定的是哪个投机路线阻力最小，他应该等待市场自行确定最高上涨点和最低下跌点，这是交易上该遵循的原则。

在看行情走势的时候，你觉得股价在130时，卖掉比买进要好。市场在持续变化，那些对行情分析半瓶子醋的人就会觉得股价能涨到150，所以买进，可是当价格回落时他们要么坚持，要么甘愿接受现实而做空。在120的时候，股价下跌遇到的阻力比较大，买比卖强，价格开涨，空头又去回补。很多人通常就是这样两面受打击，还总不吸取教训，真是让人深感奇怪。

反正最终肯定会出现让涨或跌变得比较强势的事，最大阻力点会上升或者下降。也就是说，在130的时候，买盘比卖盘强，而在120的时候则相反。价格会突破波动的区间而继续变动，很多人总会在120时做空，因为貌似市场很疲弱，而在130的时候正相反。当股市不利于他们时，他们就只能认栽。就是这些人协助确立了阻力位和支撑点。一些聪明又很有耐心的人却等着股市走向明确，他们会利用基本交易形式来帮忙，也会利用那些做错的人们对市场产生的交易力量而赚钱。那些人的错误会把价格推向最小阻力点。

我说的这个并不是很精确和公认的理论，但是每当我靠着自己对阻力最小的路线所做的判断，决定市场方向时，我的经验是，这些意外事件总是会顺从我的市场方向，也就是突发或无法预见的事件总是协助我做的市场方向。你还记得我提到过的那次在萨拉托加太平洋铁路公司的股票事件吗？我做了多头，是因为我觉得最小阻力线在上升。我就该坚持做多头，而不是听经纪人的话卖掉。公司董事们心里想什么没有任何差别，反正这也不是我能知道的事情。接着果然就发生了配股率突然提高，股价涨了30点的事情。股价若到了164，看起来就非常高了，可正如我之前所说，股价绝对不会高得不能买进，或是低得不能卖出。股价的高低，从本质上来说，与确立最小阻力线没什么关系。

如果你按照我说的方法交易，实际炒股时你会知道，收盘后出来的大信息通常都配合阻力最小的路线。在消息出来前，走向就已经定了。牛市时，人们会忽视利空消息，而夸大利好消息，反过来也一样。世界大战爆发前，股市很不好。德国宣布了无限制潜艇战政策。我当时放空了50万，并不是我得到了什么消息，而是我沿着最小阻力线来做。就我的操作而言，德国的宣布好比晴天霹雳。我利用这种情况，当天就回补了空头。

我说你只需要观察股市行情，确立好关口，只要你确定最小阻力线后，就准备沿着这条线路交易，这听起来很简单。可是，在实际的交易过程中，却必须要防备很多事情，最重要的是要小心你自己——也就是要对抗人心的弱点。这就是为什么我说正确的人总有股力量——基本情势和错误的人——在帮助他。在牛市期，人们会对利空消息不那么重视，这就是人性，可人们还对这一点表示震惊。因为一两个地区的天气很恶劣，大家会告诉你说，小麦作物完了，等到整个作物收成，所有的产区的小麦都被送到谷仓时，多头会惊讶地发现损害程度如此轻微。他们发现，自己只是帮了空头的忙。

做期货交易，不能保持固定不变的思维，而必须要思维活跃。不管你对谷物供需情况持什么态度，都不要忽略行情记录里面的信息。我记得有一次我由于鲁莽错失了良机。我对情势很确定，觉得没必要等待最小阻力线，我甚至有过要帮它确立的想法，因为好像只需要一点点协助就行了。

我觉得棉花会暴涨。棉花当时一直在每磅12美分上下浮动，范围很小。我知道自己应该稍等一下，可我同时觉得只要稍微推一下，就可以让它突破阻力位。

我买了5万包棉花，它果然涨了。我一停止买进，它也就不再继续上涨，接着跌落到了我开始买进时的价格。我退出来，它也就不跌了。我认为我现在更接近出发点了，于是我立刻认为我应该再度出发。我也这样做了。同样的事情又发生了一次，我抬高了价格，一停止买进我就看到价格下跌。我来来回回这样做了四五次，最终只好放弃，一共赔了20万。没过多久，棉花又开始涨了，居然涨到了让我恨死自己的程度，如果我不那么急着开始该多好啊。

很多玩家都经历过很多次这样的事情，所以我定了一条原则：市场窄幅波动时，价格波动范围很小，要预估下一个大波动是往上还是往下，这个实在没什么意义。应该做的事情是观察市场，分析走向，判定浮动上下线，在价格没有突破上下线时，千万不要有所行动。投机的人必须要一心一意靠市场获利，而非坚持等大盘形势与自己的预估一样。永远不要向综合行情叫板，不要询问理由或解释。事后替股市解剖验尸没有任何好处。

前不久，我和几个朋友在一起，他们在讨论小麦期货。有人觉得会涨，有人觉得会跌，他们最后问我的看法。我已经有了一段时间的市场经验，我知道他们想得到的不是统计数据，也不是对行情的判断，因此我说：“你们要是想在小麦市场赚钱，我可以教你们方法。”

他们当然说想赚钱，我就说：“你们要是真想赚钱的话，观察情势就可以，然后等着，耐心点。等到1.2美元的时候就买进，就能赚很大一笔。”

“为什么现在不买？才1.14美元。”有人说。

“因为现在还不能确定上涨的真实性。”

“那为什么要在1.2美元时买进？不是更贵了吗？”

“你想鲁莽地大赚一次，还是明智又保险地少赚点呢？”

他们都回答说，最好是稳稳当当赚点。于是我说：“那就听我的没错，1.2美元时再去买。”

我所料没错，我已经观察了很长时间。几个月来，小麦一直在1.1和1.2美元间浮动，没其他特殊的状况出现。终于有一天，收市时的价格是1.19美元。我早做了准备，如果没什么意外的话，第二天开盘价就是1.205美元。所以我买进了。小麦的价格从1.21涨到了1.25，我当然是一路加码了。

此时我跟你说不清到底是怎么回事，我对它的小小浮动也给不出解释，我不能告诉你，浮动只向上突破1.2还是向下跌破1.1。我觉得就是会上涨，因为当时小麦非常缺乏。

其实，欧洲似乎一直在悄悄地买进，很多人在1.19美元时放空。因为欧洲人的买入，加上其他一些原因，很多小麦都被转运从市场上消失了，因此最后出现了大波动，价格突破1.20美元。这是我的观点，也是我需要的唯一事实。我明白因为价格上涨积攒了力量，到了1.20美元时就会冲破上限。也就是说，过了1.20这个线，小麦价格的最小阻力线就确立了，随后的情形就不大相同了。

我记得那天是美国的节假日，美国所有市场都闭市。加拿大温尼伯在开盘时却每蒲式耳涨了6美分，第二天美国市场开盘时，也涨了6美分。价格只是按照阻力最小的路线在前行而已。

我说的这一切表明，我玩这些的主要方法就是研究市场行情。我只是了解了价格最可能的前行方向，我会多玩几次继续验证我的判断。我从一开始就注意观察，我的交易让市场价格发生了什么变化。

我买股票的时候，喜欢以高价买入，以低价卖出，很多经验丰富的股民听到这种话时都会露出吃惊的表情。如果交易者总是坚持自己的投机利器，赚钱不是什么难事。就是说，等到最小阻力线明确了以后，行情上涨的时候买进，下跌的时候卖出，并且应该一路加码，要赚钱并不困难。例如在上涨时积攒头寸，先买进总量的五分之一，若没有多少利润，就要停止买入，因为很明显一开始就搞错了，或者至少是暂时错了，不管什么时候出了错，都不会有钱可赚的。行情记录说会上涨，不见得是说谎，完全是因为行情记录现在是说：“还没到时候”。

我做棉花期货一直很成功。我有自己的理论，而且绝对遵照这个理论。如果我想做到四五万包，那么我就会像之前说的那样，研究好市场行情，搞明白到底是该买还是该卖。如果最小阻力线有上升迹象，我就会先买1万，然后市场如果还在上涨，我就会再来1万。如果我有20个点的利润，或者每包能赚1美元，我就会继续买2万包，然后达到满仓，我就是用这个方法赚钱的。可若我买了一两万包以后，有波动性的亏损，那就要平仓。这说明我看错了形势，或者只是暂时错了，可我不是提到过吗，不管哪种错，都不会有钱可赚。

我坚持自己的那一套，借着它我在每次的棉花市场波动时，都能够保持住自己的实力。在建仓的时候，可能会用暂时亏损五六万的操作去验证市场。貌似这个验证有点太贵了，可实际却不见得。当市场正儿八经开始时，我损失的那点钱很快就会赚回来。不要不放过机会，在正确的时刻采取正确的行动，就会赚到钱。

我已经说了我在市场交易时的整套方法。只在赚钱的时候下大注，而错的时候也就只亏损了那点用来测试的钱，这是个聪明的做法。如果按照我说的这种办法去玩，就会一直保持住有钱可赚的头寸，能在大赌注中获利不少。

专业玩家们总能依靠自己的经验，建立各种玩法，这些都取决于他们如何对待投机这件事。我记得在棕榈滩的时候，碰到过一位老人，猛然间还想不起他叫什么名字。我知道他从南北战争时期就在华尔街混江湖，有人告诉我说他非常聪明，身经百战，因此他喜欢说世界上没什么新鲜事物，至少股市中是没有的。

老人问了我很多问题，我告诉他我平时是怎么样做的，他点着头说：“没错，没错，你是对的，你的做事方式和思维方法，都对你非常有用。你很容易按照自己的想法行事，因为你投进去的钱是你最不重视的部分。我想起了帕特·赫恩这个人，你听过吧？他是个很有名的赌客，在我们那边开了户。他非常聪明，是个性情中人。他就靠炒股赚钱，所以会有人喜欢跟他交流要他提供建议。他从来都不肯说。如果有人直截了当地问他对他们持股的看法，他就会说出他在赛场上最喜欢的那句话：‘在你开赌之前一切都属未知。’他在我们公司炒股，会先选择很火的股票买100股，如果能上涨百分之一，他会继续买100股，接着涨的话还继续买。他经常说，自己玩这个游戏，不是为了把钱送给别人，所以他总会把止损单放在最后交易的那笔单子的价格以下1个点的地方。股价如果涨了他就继续，有个百分之一的回调，他就立刻平仓。他说如果赔到1个点以上，就是个大傻帽，不管赔的钱是原来保证金里面的还是浮动利润里面的，都一样。

“你懂的，专业赌徒对长线没多少兴趣，只想着赚点稳当的钱。当然了，如果长线能做好，那也是不错的。帕特炒股从来不听信内幕消息，也不想着在一星期赚20点。他只想着能赚点让他过得不错的小钱。我在华尔街碰到过很多人，有成千上万的外行，而只有帕特一个人把投机炒股当作机会游戏，像轮盘赌博一样，可他的下注方式很实用。

“帕特·赫恩去世以后，一个经常和帕特一起玩的人，用帕特的办法在拉卡万纳赚了十几万后就去做其他股票了。他觉得赚了很多了，不用再用帕特的方式玩了。当股价回调的时候，他没有止损，而是任由它发展，让亏损像利润一样持续扩大。最后当然是亏了个血本无归，还倒欠了几千块。

“他硬撑了两三年，赔钱后还一直很狂热。但是只要他自制，我们也不反对他待在股市里。我记得他坦白承认过，没一直按照帕特的方式交易是一个很笨的决定。忽然有一天，他来找我，显得很激动，求我借他一些股票，他要卖掉。过去他一直是个不错的客户，是个好小伙儿，所以我愿意替他的账户担保，让他放空100股。

“他放空了100股湖岸公司的股票，这是在1875年，是比尔·特瑞威尔斯正压制股市的那个阶段。我的这个叫罗伯斯的朋友，在点位正好时卖掉股票，股市下跌的过程中，他一直在卖，正如他之前遵守帕特的交易原则时常做的那样，很成功。

“嗯，罗伯斯一连四天加码抛售，账面上就有了1.5万美元的利润。我看到他没有设止损单，就提醒了他，他告诉我大跌还没开始，他不想被一点儿反弹干掉。这个时候是8月，到了9月中旬的时候，他居然到了跟我借10美元，为他的第四个孩子买辆儿童车的地步。他没有一直用被证实过很有效的办法去投机，这也是很多人的问题。”老先生摇着头发表了长篇大论。

他说得没错，我有时候感觉投机是个很不自然的工作，因为我觉得很多投机玩家都倾向于做违背本性的决定。谁都有弱点，这对投机来说是很严重的问题，而这些弱点在人们做其他事情时经常会被防范住，不像在炒股时这么危险。

投机商最大的敌人是自己的内心。人性与希望和恐惧密不可分。在炒股时，当市场不利于你时，你无时无刻不在祈求这是最后一天，可你赔了的总是多于你想象的；当市场对你有利时，你又恐惧了，你怕第二天就会失去利润，所以会赶紧抽身，可这太早了。害怕使你不敢赚本应该赚的那些钱。成功者必须要一直与这两种扎牢在内心的本能做斗争，必须打败本能的冲动。当充满希望的时候，他该有所敬畏；当害怕的时候，他该满怀希望。他必须害怕小亏损会变成大亏损，希望小利润变成大利润。像普通人那样在股票上赌博，绝对是错误的。

我从14岁开始投机，这是我做过的唯一一件事，我知道我在说什么。我有30年的交易经历，能赚几美元的小小交易我干过，几百万的巨大交易我也玩过，我得出了这样的结论：人在一段时间里可以战胜某只股票，可没有一个人能够战胜股市。人可能从棉花和谷物期货市场上赚钱，但没人能打败整个期货市场。就像赌马一样，人可能会赢一场比赛，但不可能战胜这种游戏。

如果我知道怎么让这个结论更具说服力和影响力，我必定会去做。若有人不同意，也没什么关系，我自己知道这些结论是完全正确的，不容置疑的。





第十一章


现在让我回过头来继续讲1907年10月的事情。我买了一艘游艇，做好所有准备，离开纽约去南边游玩。我太喜欢钓鱼了，现在有了游艇，我想去哪里都行，什么时候去都可以，只要我愿意的话。一切准备都做好了，我在股票上赚了很多钱。可是，临到最后时，玉米期货市场把我留了下来。

我必须解释一下，在那次我遇到的第一个100万的资金恐慌前，我就在芝加哥做过谷物期货。我各做了1000万蒲式耳的小麦和玉米的空头，我对这个市场研究了很久，就像看淡股市一样，我也看淡谷物市场。

谷物一直在下跌。当小麦下跌严重时，芝加哥的一个大玩家——我们把他称作斯特雷登吧——想垄断玉米市场。我把股票全部清盘后，准备乘游艇去游玩，却发现自己在小麦市场上有很大的浮动利润。因为斯特雷登把玉米价格抬得很高，我承受着很大的浮动亏损。

我知道玉米存货量不少，供需法则总是会发挥作用。可是需求主要来自斯特雷登，供应却比较匮乏，因为交通不好导致玉米没法运送。我曾祈愿要是有魔法相助多好，让农民们能把玉米送到市场中来，可惜这是不可能的。

事情就是这样，当我即将开始计划已久的钓鱼之旅时，玉米的亏损把我拉住了。市场这个样子，我没法走脱。当然了，斯特雷登很注意空头，我完全被他抓在股掌之间，而我也清楚这一点。可是，就像我说的那样，我把希望寄托在天气上。但当我觉得天气和其他好心人都没办法帮我时，我就将精力放在了研究如何靠自己来摆脱这种困境上。

我把小麦头寸平了，得到了比较高的利润。玉米的事情却非常艰难，我若用当时的价格回补我的1000万蒲式耳玉米的话，我会很高兴地立刻这样做，虽然这样损失会特别大。可当我一开始买进玉米，斯特雷登就会全心全力成为主要轧空我的人，我可不愿意因为我自己买进，而抬高我要付出的价格，就像我不喜欢拿刀子割自己的喉咙一样。

玉米虽然很强劲，可我想去钓鱼的愿望更加强烈。因此我要立即想方设法行动起来，进行一次战略性撤退。我需要把我做空头的那1000万蒲式耳买进来，而且要尽力把损失降到最低。

事有凑巧，当时斯特雷登也玩着一大把燕麦，牢牢地垄断了市场。我搜集了有关谷物市场的很多新闻与消息，研究它们的市场走向。据说很有实力的阿莫尔与斯特雷登关系不好，我也知道除非我按照他的价格买进，不然他不会让我买到我需要的玉米。所以我立刻想到要去阿莫尔那里找办法，寻求帮助。他们要帮助我，只有一个办法，就是把斯特雷登不肯卖给我的玉米卖给我，那接下来的事情就好办了。

我先是发了一些单子出去，每当降低1/8美分的时候，就买50万蒲式耳的玉米。等这些单子生效了，我就让四个经纪人以市价卖出50万蒲式耳的燕麦。我清楚那些交易商的想法，他们肯定会觉得是阿莫尔要跟斯特雷登开战了。他们看到有人损压燕麦之后，一定会很合理地断定下一个就会是玉米了，因此他们会卖掉玉米，从而打破垄断局面。那可赚的就多了。

我对芝加哥投机商这种心理的判断绝对正确。他们发现各地来的卖单敲开燕麦的价格垄断后，立刻开始打压玉米，迫不及待地开始往外卖。十分钟时间，我就买了600万蒲式耳的玉米。等我发现他们停止往外抛售玉米的时候，我干脆用市价买了另外400万蒲式耳，这就让价格又上涨了。我这样做的结果是，在抛售浪潮中，我用很好的价格回补了整整1000万蒲式耳的玉米头寸，价格跟我趁交易者卖出开始回补时的行情，差距在0.5美分之内。而且，我拿出来诱出投机商的那20万蒲式耳燕麦，只带来了3000美元的损失，这是特别廉价的投入。同时，我在小麦上赚到的钱，又把玉米的亏损补回来了。如此一来，我在谷物市场只损失了2.5万美元。这个事情之后，玉米每蒲式耳上涨了25美分。如果不管价格买进1000万蒲式耳玉米的话，损失可就无法估量了。

同一件事情，不能花了几年时间，还没有形成正确的做事态度，这是专业人士与业余人员的区别。如何对待事物，决定了人们在市场中是赚还是赔。一般人对自己的付出持有的观点很不专业，容易自高自大，思考也深入不下去。专业人士则重视做事的正确性，不只是赚钱，因为他们清楚，尽力把事情做好，钱自然就能赚到。交易者在玩这种游戏时要像撞球专家一样，看到前面很多步，而不要仅仅盯着眼前这一杆。为了争取优越而操作，必须变成一种直觉。

我记得好像听过一个有关艾迪生·科马克的故事，这是个特别恰当的实例。以我所闻，科马克是华尔街最有能力的股票作手之一，他不像很多人认为的那样总是在做空头。他觉得利用希望和恐惧两大人性因素，来帮助他做空是很有用的。他编造了这样一句警语：“在元气还在上升的时候，不要放空股票！”老前辈告诉我说，他赚得最多的钱都是做多赚来的，所以显然他炒股不片面，只根据实况来，确实是个很有水平的商人。有一次，离牛市结束还有一段时间，科马克就很不看好后市。不过当时市场还很强劲，股价一直在上涨——这都是多头集团和报纸报道造成的现况。一个叫乔瑟夫的喜欢传播消息的金融记者知道后找到科马克。他明白像科马克这样的人，非常需要利空的消息。

“科马克先生，我有个好朋友在圣保罗公司工作过，他刚才对我说了些事情，我认为你应该知道才对。”

“什么事？”科马克显得爱理不理。

“你改变方向了吗？你现在对后市不太看好吧？”乔瑟夫为了搞清状况，想知道科马克有没有兴趣，要是没有的话，他也用不着浪费宝贵的子弹。

“是啊。到底什么好消息？”

“今天，我去圣保罗公司了，每周我都会去采访两三次，我朋友对我说，老头子在卖股票，他说的是威廉·洛克菲勒。股价每每上涨3/8个点，洛克菲勒就卖出1500股。这两天他一直忙着卖。我可没耽误时间，立马就来对你说了。”

科马克可不是个沉不住气的人，而且他已经对各色人等冲进办公室这样的事习以为常了，这些人通常都会带来些乱七八糟的东西，他根本不信任他们了，所以他说道：“你肯定没听错吧，乔瑟夫？”

“我肯定，必须肯定。你觉得我是聋子吗？”乔瑟夫说。

“那你相信你的朋友吗？”

“绝对相信！”乔瑟夫说，“我们认识好多年了，他从来没对我说过谎，他绝对不会说谎。他非常可靠，我可以拿性命来为他的话担保，在这个世界上我最了解他——远比你我认识这么多年之后，你对我的了解还要深很多啊。”

“确定，没错吧？”科马克又看着乔瑟夫说，“好吧，你应该没错。”他喊来了一个营业员惠勒尔。乔瑟夫以为他会下单卖掉5万股圣保罗股票。威廉·洛克菲勒正在抛售圣保罗公司的股票，不管是投机股还是投资股，都没关系，最重要的事实是最高明的股票作手洛克菲勒想从圣保罗公司退出来。一个正常人听到这个可靠的消息会怎么办呢？根本不用问。

可是，科马克——这一时期最优秀的空头股票操控者，当时已经看淡了后市——却对营业员说：“比利，去交易所，每每上涨3/8美分就买进圣保罗的1500股。”那时候这只股票的价格是90美元左右。

“你说的是卖吧？”乔瑟夫插嘴说，他并不是华尔街的新人，可他对待市场的方式还是新闻人士，也就是普通大众的样子。因为内幕人士在抛售，价格自然会下跌，可哪个卖家还能比洛克菲勒更牛呢。标准石油公司正在抛售，科马克却在买进，怎么可能呢！

“不，”科马克说，“我说的是买入。”

“你不信任我？”

“不是，我信任。”

“你不相信我的情报？”

“我相信。”

“你现在不看好后市吧？”

“对。”

“那你这是要做什么呀？”

“这就是我为什么要买入。你听我说，你去跟你朋友继续联系，要是洛克菲勒停止了卖股票，就赶紧告诉我，快去吧，听明白没？”

“好的。”乔瑟夫说完就走了。他不知道是不是真明白了科马克的意思。科马克看淡市场，使他的操作更没法让人理解。不过，乔瑟夫还是去找他那个朋友了，告诉了他科马克的意思，而且每天打两次电话询问情况。

有一天，乔瑟夫的朋友对他说：“老头子不卖股票了。”乔瑟夫感谢了他，然后来找科马克。

科马克专心听他说完，转身问惠勒尔：“我们现在大概有多少圣保罗公司的股票？”惠勒尔查看后说，大概是6万股。

科马克一直做空，早在买入圣保罗股票之前，他就卖掉了很多其他公司的股票，是整个市场的大空头。他马上让惠勒尔卖掉那6万股圣保罗股票，当作是打压市场的武器，使他的空头操作大大获利。

圣保罗跌到了44美元，科马克大赚了一把。他用绝佳的技巧来操作，我认为最重要的是他对市场交易的习惯感知，他很敏感地看到了比单独靠这个股票来赚钱还要重要很多的东西，他发现了一个全面施展做空的绝佳机会。他靠着圣保罗股票的消息买入而不是卖出，原因是他明白这是一个积累筹码的最好时机。

要回过头来说说我自己了。我结束小麦和玉米的交易后，坐游艇去了南边海域。我在佛罗里达州玩得特别痛快，钓鱼也很顺利。一切都看上去很美。我不用去想这个世界上的任何事情，更不想去获得什么东西。

有一天，我到了棕榈滩，看到很多来自华尔街的朋友，他们在聊棉花期货市场的事情。从纽约传来消息说，珀西·托马斯赔掉了血本，这是这位厉害角色在棉花市场上第二次遭受巨大失败。

我很佩服托马斯这个人。初次听说他是通过报纸，当时证券交易所会员公司谢尔顿·托马斯公司倒闭，那个时候，托马斯想到垄断棉花市场，可是谢尔顿却没那么大的魄力和眼界，在快成功时害怕了。反正整个华尔街都是这么传的。他们不但没赚到钱，还遭遇了多年的大赔本。我记不清他们赔了多少钱，总之公司破产了，托马斯和谢尔顿也分道扬镳了。后来托马斯转过来把所有精力都用在了棉花交易上，没多久就东山再起，不但还清了所有的债，包括那些法律规定的并不需要还清的部分，还剩下了100万。他在棉花市场的东山再起的事迹，和“老手白”在股市的著名杰作一样让人惊叹，老手白在一年里靠股市操作，还清了100万美元的债务。托马斯的勇气和头脑使我非常景仰他。

棕榈滩的所有人都在说3月托马斯在棉花市场遭遇滑铁卢的事情，你明白他们会怎样以讹传讹的。我曾经遇到过一个关于我的谣言，也是这样被夸大其词、添油加醋地传播的，以至于在不到一天时间内，当这个谣言重新传回最初编造这个谣言的那个人耳朵里时，他都不知道是怎么回事了。谣言已经被增添得枝繁叶茂了。

托马斯事件也改变了我的想法，我不想再继续度假了，我要回到棉花市场中去。我找了很多交易文件认真研读，想了解清楚事实。回到纽约，我看到所有人都在做空头，大卖7月棉花期货。我觉得人们就像得了传染病，谁去做什么，是因为他周围的人都在这么做，或许这是群众心理的某种阶段或变化。不管怎样，很多人都觉得卖掉是最聪明最安全的做法。交易的人们只看到了市场的一面和有可能出现的暴利。他们的的确确觉得价格会崩溃。

我肯定也看到了这些情况，但是我想到放空的那些人是没多少时间回补的。我分析得越深入，就搞得越清楚，最后做出了买进7月棉花的决定。我开始着手实施，买了10万包，这很容易办到，大量的人都在卖出。在我看来，我甚至可以悬赏100万美元，不论死活，抓一个没有卖7月棉花的人，肯定没有人来领赏。

那时候是5月下旬，我不停地买进，他们不停地卖出。我把所有卖出的全部买了以后，一共是12万包棉花。我停手后没两天，棉花开始涨价，市场状态特别好，一天内就涨了四五十点。

我开始买入棉花十多天后，一个周六，价格上涨的速度放慢了。我不清楚是不是有人还想卖，所以一直等着，到了闭市前的最后十分钟。我知道这个时间经常是空头入市的时候，如果高位收盘，他们肯定会被我套住。所以，我发出了四张不同的单子，同时以市价各买进5000包，把价格拉高了30个点，那些做空的人慌不择路了。市场在最高价收盘了，请知悉，我只是买了2万包棉花。

第二天是周日，等到周一时，利物浦本来高开20点就能配合纽约的市场行情，没想到它高开了50个点，这就是说利物浦的涨势超过我们的涨势百分之百。利物浦市场走高与我是没关系的，这个情况说明了我的推断是正确的，我是按照最小阻力线完成的交易。当然我也不会忘记，我手上有大批的棉花要脱手。市场能够暴涨，也能够缓缓上涨，可它的容量也有限度。

利物浦的消息引发我们的市场狂涨，可是我却发现涨得越高，7月棉花的成交量却越少。我准备一点儿都不卖。总的来说，周一对空头来说，就是很崩溃的日子。不过，我也没发现任何空头惊恐，也没有空头争相回补的迹象，我必须要为我手里的14万包棉花找到去处。

周二一大早，我去办公室的时候在门口遇到了一个朋友，他笑呵呵地说：“《世界报》今早发了一则大消息啊。”

“什么消息？”我问。

“嗯？你难道还没看报纸吗？”

“呃，报道的是你呀，你把7月棉花垄断到手中了。”

“我没看报呢。”我回答道。我不知道他是否相信，说不定他觉得我没说真话，不是好哥们儿。

到办公室后，我拿了一份《世界报》，看到头版头条写着：“拉里·利文斯顿垄断7月棉花期货。”

我马上感觉市场要受这个报道影响了。我如果仔细研究该怎样刻意寻找什么方法卖掉我的14万包棉花的话，再也没有比这个更好的计划了。这时候，全国各地的人都从《世界报》或其他转载了这个消息的报纸上看到了这个消息，而且它也已被欧洲市场知晓了，利物浦的市场价格说得一清二楚，疯狂的市场因为这条消息而失控，也没什么惊奇的了。

我知道纽约市场会面临什么变化，也清楚该怎么去应对市场。上午十点开盘，十点十分的时候，我就已经卖完了棉花。我把那14万包棉花转给了别人，我的大部分头寸都是在当天价位最高的时候交易的。那些人替我塑造了很好的市场，其实我要做的就是抓住这个机会，卖掉我的棉花。我确实利用了这次机会，我可不能让机会随风而逝，我不这么做还能怎样？

本来要花费很大精力才能解决的问题，就因为这么一个机会而轻易解决了。要是没有《世界报》的这篇新闻，我一旦卖出就会赔掉大量的浮动利润。我可没能力卖掉14万包7月棉花期货，还不拉低市场价格。无论如何，《世界报》的这条新闻就是恰逢其时地帮了我，我不知道它为什么会报道这个新闻，我确实想知道。我觉得，那位记者可能从清楚棉花市场的朋友处听到了消息，就认为是个独家好新闻。我不认识这个记者，更没见过《世界报》的其他职员。那天上午九点我才知道了这个消息，而且要不是那个朋友跟我说，我还不清楚。

如果没这个新闻，也就没有大到可以让我卖掉棉花的市场。交易量大是很恼人的，平仓的时候就不能安全地退出来。你不能像在做小买卖一般自如，不能在想卖或者能卖的时候退出，而必须在市场有足够空间接纳你的卖出时再卖。只要错过时机，就要赔掉很多。要快刀斩乱麻，不可犹豫，否则就赔大了。你也不能把出货价拉高，这不是好办法，因为有可能会把买盘的力量减弱。另外，我还要说，想抓住机会并不容易，必须要行动迅速，在机会到你门口探头的时候，一定要抓住。

当然并不是每个人都知道我的运气来了。在包括华尔街在内的很多地方，任何让一个人赚大钱的意外事故都会令人起疑，可谁要是偶然赔光，人们就不会觉得是偶然，而会看作是欲望和自以为是的结果。一旦你突然赚了很多钱，人们就把你赚的钱看作是掠压来的财富，会说“厚颜无耻有好报，保守和正直没有好报”。

那些做空的人因为粗心而赔钱后陷入痛苦，骂我是在有计划地破坏市场，而其他的人也会这样想。

过了一两天，一个棉花交易市场上的世界级大佬遇到我，他说：“利文斯顿，这可是你玩得最聪明的一把。我那时候还想呢，你要是卖掉的话会赔多少。要知道当时市场没多少需求，市场是没有五六万包的容纳量的。你能够卖掉比这个数目多很多的棉花，而且没有赔掉一点点浮动利润，这其中的手法真让人拍案叫绝，真是没想到你有这么一手，厉害啊。”

“这与我无关。”我很诚恳。

可他却不断重复说：“兄弟，聪明啊，太厉害了，你不要谦虚。”

这件事情之后，很多报纸都把我称作“棉花之王”。但是就像我说过的，我根本配不上这个殊荣。不说你也能明白，美国人不可能富有到能买下《世界报》的栏目，也没有谁能牛到让报纸刊登那样的新闻。可是，《世界报》当时确实给我塑造了一个虚名。

但是，我告诉你这个故事，并不是想让偶尔强加在某些名不符实的交易者身上的头衔合理化，也不是为了说抓住机会有多么重要，不管这种机会在什么地方、以什么形式出现，而只是想说明，我做了7月棉花交易之后，数量大得惊人的报纸报道替我扬了名。如果没有那些报道，我是不可能有机会和著名的棉花奇才珀西·托马斯见面的。





第十二章


在那次出人意料地做完了7月棉花生意后，没过多久我就收到了一封信，珀西·托马斯想邀请我会面。我马上回复他说，非常愿意在办公室跟他约见，时间由他说了算。第二天，他就上门了。

我已经崇拜他很长时间了。只要在棉花种植和交易市场上，托马斯都是一块大招牌。在欧美地区，大家都对我引述过托马斯的观点。我记得在瑞士度假的时候，我和一个开罗的银行家聊过天，他与离世的内斯·特卡塞尔公爵一起在埃及种过棉花，当他知道我是从纽约来的人后，赶紧跟我打听珀西·托马斯的事情。托马斯的市场报告他期期必读。

我一向觉得托马斯做生意的方法很科学，是个货真价实的投机商，也是个很有眼界、非常勇敢的思想家，是个消息极为灵通的人，精通棉花交易市场的理论与实践。托马斯既爱听也爱表达观念、想法和抽象事物，对棉花交易商的心理也抓得很准，因为他已经做了多年的交易，是个大赚也大赔过的老手。

在他原来的谢尔顿·托马斯公司倒闭后，他把责任揽入自己怀中。不到两年时间，他就东山再起。我记得《太阳报》刊登过他的事迹。他先摆平了欠账，然后雇了一个专家，专门为他研究分析怎么去投资100万美元。那个专家经过分析和研究很多大公司的市场报告后，建议他买入德拉瓦·哈德森公司的股票。

赔过几百万，又赚了更多以后，托马斯还是在3月棉花交易中失去了一切。他跟我一见面就进入正题，提议我俩合伙来做。他得到的任何消息都会立刻转给我，然后才向大众发布。而我的主要工作就是实际去执行，他说我在这上面很有天赋，正好弥补了他的不足。

就算他说出一大堆条件来，我都不感兴趣。我很坦诚地对他说，我认为我没有办法跑双头马车，也不热衷学习这样做。可他就是认为我俩是最合适的合作伙伴，我最后只能直截了当地告诉他，我可不希望影响任何人的交易。

我对他说：“我如果赔了，自己来承担，也会坦然面对失败，没有什么其他烦闷的事情。我一个人做很自在，这是对我来说最明智最有效的方法。我在与其他交易者争斗时，从中获得乐趣。这些人我从来没有见过，没有说过话，也没有对他们提过该怎么去做生意的建议，我从来不期望会遇到他们或认识他们。我赚钱了，就会当作好的经验。我不违背我的经验，也不靠买卖与利用消息获利。我如果用违背意愿的办法赚钱，就会感觉像是没真正赚到钱一样。我对你的想法没什么兴趣，我只喜欢我自己的那一套游戏方式。”

他说，很遗憾听我这么说，并且会想办法让我知道，不跟他合作是个大错误。可我就是坚持我的观点。接下来我俩谈得倒是很轻松愉悦。我对他说，我就知道他一定能够东山再起，也表达了我愿意出钱帮他的意愿。但他却不想跟我借钱。最后他跟我打听有关7月棉花交易的情形，我全部告诉了他，怎么做的、做了多少、价格如何，还有其他的事情。我们又谈了一阵儿后，他离开了。

我原来说过，交易商有很多敌人，其中很多敌人能够成功地从内心攻击你。我也知道我出过很多问题。我知道，一个人可能有自己的观点，也会独立思考，却仍然可能败给能说会道的人。我相当能够避免一般投机的毛病，如贪婪、恐惧和希望。但身为大众的一员，我也有很多弱点在身。

此时我应该时刻警惕着才对，因为前不久我就遇到过一件事情，它说明人是很容易被轻易蛊惑去做有违自我判断和意愿的事情的。那是在哈丁兄弟公司的时候，我在那儿有个类似贵宾室的个人办公室，是他们为我提供的。在炒股的时候，没有我的同意，谁都不能打扰我。我不想让人打扰，是因为我做的是大生意，收益是很不错的，他们要对我严加保护。

有一天，在刚刚收市后，有人跟我打招呼：“下午好啊，利文斯顿先生。”

我转身看到了一个陌生人，大概35岁，我不知道他怎么进来的，可他确实出现在了我跟前。我想，他可能有跟我的业务有关的事情找我，所以才被允许进来的。我没说什么，只看着他。他马上就说：“我想跟你聊聊沃尔特·斯科特。”然后就不再开口了。

他是书市代理商人，他的态度不会让人感到特别愉快，而且也不是特别善于言辞，看来也不会特别有魅力。可是，他很有特点。他说话，我想我在听，但是我不知道他在说什么，我想我可能永远也不会知道。他滔滔不绝地说完后，就拿给了我一支钢笔和一张空白表格，我签了个名。那是一张协议书，用500美元买斯科特的一套书。

我签完名后才明白过来，他已经把协议书装在了衣服口袋。我不想买那套书，也没地方放书。那套书对我其实一点儿用处都没有，又没人可送。但我却同意花500美元买了它。

我对亏钱已经很习惯了，因此我在思考时，最先想的绝对不是错误的那一部分，我总是思考操作本身。我必须要先搞懂自己的思维习惯和局限性，其次我不该再犯同样的错误。生而为人，只有在一件错事上吸取教训，然后在出现同样的事情后，能够确证没有重蹈覆辙，这样才会完全谅解自己曾经的过错。

唉，我犯了一个500美元的错误，却找不到问题所在。我就盯着他看，首先要评量评量他。他也看着我，一脸笑容。他似乎知道我要做什么。我觉得根本没必要跟他解释什么了。我不说话他也知道我肯定要说话。所以我决定不去解释，也不能纠结刚才的事情，直接问他：“那500美元，你能有多少提成？”

他摇着头说：“对不起，我不能那样。”

“你能赚多少？”我继续问。

“三分之一，可我不能那样。”他回道。

“500美元，三分之一是166.66美元，如果你把刚才那份协议还给我，我给你200美元现金。”为了让他相信，我从口袋掏出了200美元。

“我说了不能这样做。”他说。

“你所有的客户都给你同样的条件吗？”我问。

“不是。”他说。

“那你怎么会知道我会提出这个条件？”

“这就是你们这类人的做事风格了。你是个优秀的输家，这一点使你成为一个顶尖的商人。我很感谢你，可我不能那样做。”

“那你为什么不想挣比你的提成更多的钱呢？”

“这不是挣不挣提成的事。”他说，“我不是为了那点提成工作的。”

“那是为什么？”

“为了提成和纪录。”他回答。

“什么纪录？”

“我的纪录。”

“你的意思是什么？”

“你光是为了赚钱才工作吗？”他问我。

“是啊。”我说。

“不是吧。”他摇着头，“不会的，你不光是为了钱，如果真是那样，你不会有那么大乐趣。你工作一定不光是为了让自己银行存折上的数字增加。你到华尔街，不是因为你喜欢赚轻松的钱。你能从其他方面获得乐趣，我也是这样。”

我不跟他争辩，只是问：“你怎样获得乐趣？”

“唉，我们都有缺点。”他很坦诚。

“你的缺点是什么？”

“虚荣心。”他说。

“对啊，你完成让我签字的工作了。”我对他说，“现在，我想把签字收回，而且为你的这十分钟支付200美元，这能对你的尊严给予补偿吗？”

“不能。”他说，“你清楚，很多人在华尔街忙上几个月，最后却一分钱没挣到。他们会觉得这是商品和这个地方的原因，所以公司找我来，只是证明他们的推销方法不对，而与卖的书和这个地方没关系。他们的提成是百分之二十五。我在克利夫兰，两周就卖掉了82套。我到这里来不光是为了把书卖给从不从代理商手里买书的人，也是要把书推销给他们根本见不着面的人。这就是我能拿到三分之一提成的原因。”

“我都不知道你是怎么把书卖给我的。”

“哦。”他安慰道，“我还卖给摩根先生一套呢。”

“哈，不可能。”

他没生气，只是说道：“真的，我给他推销了一套。”

“把一套沃尔特的书卖给摩根？他不但拥有一些最精美的版本，很可能连一些小说的手稿都收藏着。”

“看吧，这是他的签名。”他把一张摩根的签名协议在我眼前晃了一下。或许那不是摩根本人的签名，不过当时我并没有怀疑。他袋子里不还有我的签名协议书吗？我就是很好奇，所以我问：“门卫为什么没拦你？”

“我没看到门卫。我在办公室见到了他本人。”

“算了吧你。”我说。谁都知道要想空手进到摩根的私人办公室，比拿着一个像闹钟一样嘀嗒作响的包裹走进白宫都艰难。

可他却说：“我进去了。”

“你怎么进去的？”

“我怎么进到你办公室的？”他问我。

“不清楚，你告诉我吧。”我说。

“嗯，我进摩根办公室的方法跟到你这里来的方法是一样的。我只是跟门口负责阻挡我的朋友聊了聊，我让摩根签字的方法也跟让你签字的方法一样。你刚刚不是签个买书的协议，只是接了我给你的笔，做了我说的事情。摩根也一样签了字。”

“真的是摩根本人签的？”三分钟后，我怀疑地问。

“当然。他还是小孩子的时候就知道怎么签字了。”

“那就是真的了？”

“是啊。”他说，“我知道自己在做什么。这就是其中的秘密。很感谢你，再见吧，利文斯顿先生。”他准备朝外走。

“请留步。”我说，“我一定要让你公平地挣到我的200美元。”我给了他35美元。

他摇头说：“不，我不能那样。但是我可以这样……”接着他从口袋中拿出协议，撕碎了，然后递给我。

我掏了200美元给他，但他仍然摇了摇头。

“这不是你想要的吗？”我问。

“不是。”

“那你撕了协议书干吗？”

“因为你没对这件事发脾气，还感同身受地理解并接受这件事。”

“但这200美元是我想给你的。”我说。

“我明白，但是钱不是一切。”

他说的话感动了我，我说：“没错，钱不能解决大问题。那我能为你做点什么？”

“你心思很敏捷，是吧？”他说，“你真的想帮我忙吗？”

“是的。”我对他说，“我要帮你一下，不过这得看你想得到什么样的帮助。”

“带我去哈丁先生的办公室，告诉他我要跟他聊三分钟。让我跟他单聊。”

我无可奈何地摇头说：“他是我的好朋友呀。”

“他都50岁了，而且也是证券交易商吧。”他说。

这倒没错，所以我只好把他带去见哈丁。从此以后，我再没听到过那人的消息。过了几周后，一个晚上，我去城里，在第六大街L线火车上碰到了他。他摘掉帽子冲我致意，我也回了礼。他走过来问我：“利文斯顿先生你好，哈丁先生好吗？”

“他很好啊，你为什么这样问？”我觉得他隐瞒了什么。

“上次你带我去见他时，我向他卖了价值2000美元的书。”

“他没对我说过。”我说。

“是啊，他那样的人怎么会说这样的事。”

“哪样的人？”

“就是那些因为犯错不好而从来不犯错的人。他们非常明白自己想要的是什么，别人说什么都白说，就是这样的人能替我的孩子出教育费，让我的太太心情愉快。利文斯顿先生，你帮了我一个大忙。当你急着给我200美元的时候，我就预测到这样的事情出现了。”

“那哈丁要是不买你的书呢？”

“嗯，我有把握，我早了解他是什么样的人。没什么问题。”

“没错。但万一他不买呢？”我固执地问。

“我就会再到你跟前，向你卖。再见，利文斯顿先生，我要去跟市长见面。”火车在公园站停下了，他起身说道。

“希望你能向他卖十套。”我说，“市长大人是民主党人。”

“我也是共和党人。”说着，他悠闲地下车，一副自信车会等着他的样子，而实际上的确是这样。

这么详细告诉你这件事的原因，是它关联到了一个重要的人，这人致使我买了不该买的东西，他是第一个让我做了不愿意做的事情的人，应该不会出现第二个这样的人才对。但是，真的有第二个。不要觉得世界上最伟大的推销员就那么一个，也不要觉得自己一定能完全免于个性的干扰。

我礼貌又坚决地拒绝了托马斯的建议，当天他离开后，我敢发誓说：我一定不会跟他一起干，我不能肯定是否还会与他见面了。可就在第二天，他寄给我一封信，对我主动提出帮他表示了感谢，还邀请我去他那里。我回信说，我会去找他。他又回信了，于是我就去拜访他。

我逐渐跟他时常会面，听他说话其乐无穷。他见识广泛，说话有趣，我觉得他是我认识的所有人里最有魅力的一个。

他博览群书，对很多事情有惊人的理解力，而且拥有天分，能够很有趣地归纳出来，所以我们海阔天空地聊着天。他灵活机智，又不油嘴滑舌，给我留下了深刻的印象。以前有很多人说他各种不好，还说他很虚伪，但我有时候想，他这么会说话，是不是因为他先说服了自己，因此能够大大增加说服别人的力量。

我们详细聊了市场交易的事情，我并不看好棉花，他却与我相反。我完全看不出有什么利多的一面，他却看多，还举了很多例子和数据，似乎百分百正确，但我仍然没有听他的。我没有说那些例子和数据不可靠，可也不能不信任自己研判得到的信念。他一直鼓吹自己的观点，直到我不再相信商报和其他报纸上的信息了，这也就是说，我不能再用自己的双眼来看市场。你不能说服一个人违背自己的信念，但可以游说他进入一种犹疑不定、优柔寡断的状态，那就更不好了，这会让人在做交易时没了自信和乐趣。

我并不是说我完全糊涂了，可我不能很好地把控自己了。确切地说，我失去了独立思考的立场。我没法细致地讲出来，是怎么逐渐进入到这种后来证明代价极为昂贵的心理状态中去的。我觉得是他对那些精确数据的自信让我最终有了那样的结局，这些数字完全归他独有，加上我的数字不可靠，不是归我独有，而是公共财产。他不断地说着自己在南边有多少可靠的消息提供者，我最后用他的那些思路分析了一下情势，就像我和他读着同一本书同一页的内容，而这本书在他手中拿着。他的思路非常明晰，我只要接受了前面的事实，后面获得的结论也就跟他一样了。

一开始，他跟我聊棉花市场时，我是不看好的，而且也做了空头。后来我听了他说的那些证据，就觉得自己之前的做法所依据的信息是不正确的。一旦托马斯使我认识到自己是错的，我补上空头后就一定得做多。我是这样考虑的，你清楚，我一辈子除了股票和期货之外，没做过什么。我理所当然地觉得，如果做空是不对的，那就应该做多。如果做多是对的，就一定要买进，就像我棕榈滩的老友提到过，希恩也喜欢说的：“你行动以后才会明白。”我必须证明我对市场的判断是否正确，证据会在经纪人月底送给我的交易清单上看到。

我开始买进棉花，很快就到了平时操作的数量，大概6万包。这是我的买卖历史上最没脑子的决定，没有靠自己的观察与分析，光陪着别人玩游戏。我的愚蠢操作不应该就此结束，也就势所必然了。我不在形势好的时候买，也没根据经验积攒头寸，这个做法就是错的。你看吧，因为听别人的话，我赔了。

市场跟我的做法没有走到一起。当我明白了自己的处境时，没有害怕也没有着急。如果托马斯是对的，市场就不应该那样发展。第一步错了，后面我又跟着出错，事情搞得一塌糊涂。我被别人的话蛊惑着没有罢手。这是与我的风格不相符的做法，跟我的行事规则不合拍。就算我在对赌行的时候，也没现在糊涂。可是，我就这么糊里糊涂地像变了个人，被托马斯洗脑了。

我不光多头做了棉花，还买了很多小麦。小麦倒是很好，浮动利润挺不错。我愚蠢地想保住棉花市场，把头寸加到15万包。应该说，我当时预感并不怎么样，这么说不是为自己的愚蠢找借口，而只是想说清事实。我记得之后我就到海滩放松了一阵子。

在海滩度假期间，我回顾思索了很多事情。我觉得，我在交易上的数量太大了。通常而言，我不会害怕，但是我变得有些紧张，所以决定减减压。因此，我想要卖出些棉花或者小麦。

看起来很离奇的是，像我这么熟悉这种游戏的人，又有12到14年的经验，可却把事情整得乱七八糟。棉花让我亏损，我却留着棉花，小麦有了利润，我却卖掉了它，简直就是愚蠢之极。不过还能有点心理安慰的是，这并不是我自己的交易方法，而是托马斯的。在所有的错误当中，没有几个比设法摊平亏损的操作更愚蠢的了。后来的棉花交易正好验证了这点。卖掉已经有了损失的头寸，而留下能够赚钱的头寸，这才是明智之举，可到现在我还非常吃惊，对我来说非常熟悉的事情，我当时怎么会反过来做呢。

就这样，我卖掉了小麦，刻意缩减我在小麦中的利润，然后小麦价格每蒲式耳上涨了20美分，我要是没有卖掉的话，会赚800万的。紧接着，因为决定要坚守亏钱的头寸，我竟然又买了很多棉花。

直到现在，我还很清晰地记得，当时是怎样一天天地买棉花，越来越多。为什么这么做？是为了不让价格跌落。如果这样不是超级傻瓜的做法，还有哪一种才是！我源源不断地拿着钱往进买，结果却赔得越来越多。我的经纪人和朋友们都觉得莫名其妙，到现在他们仍然如坠雾里。如果这笔交易结果不同的话，我一定会变成奇才。

大家都好多次地提醒过我，不要那么信任托马斯的分析。可我就是听不进去，只管买棉花，不让价格下跌，而且我还跑到了利物浦去买。当我明白自己的所作所为时，已经积累了44万包的棉花，可是已经没办法了，只能全部再卖掉。

我基本上赔尽了在股票和期货市场上赚的所有钱，虽然还没到破产的地步，可是在遇到那个自以为很聪明的托马斯之前，我可是身缠几百万的富豪，可如今只剩区区几十万了。像我这样的人，居然违背经验教导我的所有成功法则，用愚蠢已经不足以形容了。

这件事让我明白自己可能没有任何理由就做出愚蠢的操作，我花了几百万，明白了这个道理。作为一个商人，有个很危险的敌人，当一个很有蛊惑力的人怂恿他时，他会被别人的魅力打动。可是，我始终觉得，如果用100万就可以买到教训，那又为什么花更多的钱呢？命运女神不会让你自己决定学费的。她严厉地教导你，然后把账单奉上，她清楚你一定会照单全付。知道我可能会做多么愚蠢的事情后，我结束了这件意外，托马斯消失在了我的交际圈内。

我的情形就是这样，九成的本钱赔了进去。当了还没一年的百万富翁，那些靠聪明和运气赚来的资本，因为操作程序搞反而打了水漂。我卖了自己的那两艘游艇，过着艰苦朴素的日子。

万万没想到，福无双至祸不单行，真是运气差极了。我突然病倒了，需要20万美元现金。要是几个月前，这点小钱算不了什么，可现在我已经赔光了那些钱。我非常需要这笔钱，可怎么办呢？去哪里找钱？我不想从保证金里取出钱来，因为那样的话就没本钱继续在市场上交易了，而且要想赚回老本，就得留些钱投资。我觉得毫无办法了，只好去股市得到这笔钱。

你想啊，那有多难。你要是了解股市交易厅的那些人，就会明白我说的话。指望股市为你付账单是华尔街大多数人赔本的原因之一。如果你顽固行事，就会失去所有。

确实如此，有一年的冬天，在哈丁先生的办公室，几个抱负不小的人花三四万买一件大衣，可谁也没机会穿上。

事情是这样的：有一个后来因为只象征性地领取一美元年薪而成名的场内交易人，穿了一件海獭皮外衣来交易所。那时候的皮货不太贵，那件皮衣顶多只值1万美元。哈丁办公室有个叫鲍勃·凯安的人，想买一件镶有俄国黑貂皮边的大衣。他去打听了价格，差不多也是1万美元。

“这太贵了，这么多钱。”有人反对他买。

“价格还可以，还行吧。”凯安愉悦地说，“大概一周的薪资足矣——除非你们有人答应凑这些钱，对办公室最好的一个人表达一下敬重之意。有人要发表赠礼演说吗？没有？好吧，那就让市场替我付账。”

“为什么买这个？”哈丁问他。

“皮大衣特别适合我这种身份的人啊。”凯安挺着腰杆一脸认真地说。

“你准备怎么付账？”最喜欢追逐内幕消息的吉姆·墨菲问。

“要靠一个短期的投资，这就是方法。”凯安说，他明白墨菲只想知道明牌。

吉姆又问：“你要买哪只股票呢？”

“不是，朋友。现在不是买进的时候，我打算放空5000股的钢铁股票。它最少会降低10个点的，我只要2.5个点就好了。是不是很谨慎？”

“你知道什么消息？”墨菲急着问。他又瘦又高，黑色头发，面黄肌瘦，总怕会漏掉市场信息，所以没出去吃过午饭。

“大衣是我想要的东西里最合适我的。”鲍勃·凯安对哈丁说，“哈丁，卖掉5000股钢铁公司的股票吧，就今天。”

凯安是个豪赌分子，喜欢开玩笑，这是他让别人知道他意志坚定的方式。他放空了5000钢铁股后，股价马上就涨了。他夸口时看起来傻乎乎的，其实挺聪明的，股票涨了1.5个点的时候，他赶紧回补止损，然后对公司人说，纽约天气不冷，不适合穿皮衣，皮衣也不利于健康，还有炫富的迹象。这些话引得人们讥笑，可是没多久，有同事买了太平洋铁路的股票，也想赚点买皮衣的钱，结果却亏了1.8万，他就说：皮大衣非常适合女士穿在外面，一个谦虚恭敬的男士当成内衣穿在里面就有点不太适宜了。

之后，他们一个挨一个想通过股市买件皮外套。有一天，我说：我去买了，省得公司破产。可大家都说这样做很不光彩，如果想买就利用股市。不过，哈丁先生很支持我，那天下午，我去皮货店去买这件衣服，得知有个芝加哥商人一周前就把它买走了。

这只是个例子。在华尔街有很多人想通过股市赚到买汽车、首饰、游艇、名画的钱，却最终赔了本。那些被市场拒绝支付的礼物钱，都能建起一座大医院了。事实上，华尔街所有的扫把星当中，我认为想说服市场担任乐善好施的小仙女这种想法是最忙碌又最常见的扫把星。

像所有千真万确的扫把星一样，这个扫把星有它存在的道理。一个人要想从市场上赚到他想要的东西，怎么办？他就会成为大赌客，承担比他冷静研究基本形势，得到合理的信念和意见，再据以聪明地投机时更大的风险。他从一开始就想一口气吃成个胖子，根本不想等。即使市场对他有利，也必须马上体现出来。他自以为是地觉得是下了一个机会均等的赌注。因为他做了速战速决的准备，比如当他只想赚2点时，用2点的跌幅止损，他抱持着错误的观点，认为自己只是赌一种成败各半的机会。我见过这样想法的人赔了成千上万的资本，特别是在多头市场的高峰，市场正要小幅回调的时候买进的人。这根本不是正确的赚钱方式。

唉，在我的从商生涯中，那个巨大的错误对我的打击太大，它击垮了我，我赔掉了在棉花市场赚的钱。它猛烈地打击我，我屡战却屡败。当时我一直想着，市场最后必定会让我赚到钱，可结果我却赔了夫人又折兵。我变成了一个负债累累的家伙，不光欠了主要的几个经纪人的钱，也欠了其他公司的钱。他们当时让我做交易，连保证金都不需要缴纳。如今我欠了一大屁股债，而且从此债务缠身。





第十三章


看，我再次破产了，真是糟糕，而更糟糕的是我的交易绝对错误，这让我忧心不已，紧张焦灼，烦躁得要命，没办法静下心来推理。这就意味着我的心智状态处在了一个交易商不该出现的状态之中。

我觉得什么都出问题了。我甚至觉得没办法再恢复已经丧失的判断能力了。因为我擅长大交易，例如操作10万股的股票，所以我怕看不准小买卖。如果你只交易100股，判断正确好像没太大价值。在习惯了搞大操作，并且赚大钱以后，我就不知道小额的交易什么时候才能获得利润了。真是没办法讲述我是多么力不从心了。

再一次赔了血本，这让我没有了重新发起攻击的精力。判断失误，又欠了这么多债务。

成功了这么些年，经历了那么多为了成功而付出的代价之后，如今我的状态简直比当年在对赌行的时候还要差劲。我虽然对炒股已经了然于胸，可我对人性的弱点还了解得不透彻。没有一个人的脑袋会像机器一般，什么情况下都能高效运转。我意识到了自己也会受到影响，来自别人和我个人的不幸的影响。

赔了钱不会让我这么烦恼，可其他方面的麻烦就不同了，它们必定让我焦灼不堪。我详细地研究分析了自己的境况，很容易就知道了自己哪里出了毛病。我知道了错在哪里，什么时候出错了。谁要是想在炒股过程中表现优异，就要对自己完全了解才行。知道我可能处在愚蠢的行列中，则是一个长久的教育过程。

我有时候会想，炒股的人们为了弄明白如何让自己不自大，付出再高的代价都是值得的。很多明智的人破产，都是因为自大，自大是一种在任何地方对任何人来说都是代价昂贵的疾病。而对于一个在华尔街玩股票的人，尤为严重。

因为我有那种感觉，我在纽约并不开心。我状态不好，一点儿都不想交易。我决定离开这里，去其他地方挣钱。我觉得换一下环境，也许能够帮助我找回正常状态。所以，在投机游戏中失败后，我再次离开纽约。我的境况比破产还要惨，我欠着好几家公司超过十万美元的债。

我到了芝加哥，在那里找了一笔钱，不是很多，这表示要给我比较多的时间，我才能够赚到赔掉的那些钱。我原来打过交道的一家公司相信我之前炒股的本事，他们同意我在他们那里小小地玩一玩。

我开始谨小慎微地行动了。我不清楚如果一直在那儿，会怎么样发展，因为我在经历一件非比寻常的事情没多久后就结束了在芝加哥的短暂停留。那真是件让人没办法相信的事情啊。

有一天，我收到了一封电报，是卢修斯·塔克发来的。我与他很早就认识，当时他在一家股票交易公司做经理，我有时候与他们有业务往来，不过早就没有联系了。他发的电报内容是，快来纽约。

我明白他从我朋友那里知道了我的境况，所以一定有事找我商量。但我根本就没钱去做一次没有必要的纽约之行，所以我没照他说的去做，而是打电话给他。

“你的电报我收到了。”我说，“有什么事情啊？”

“纽约有个大银行家想见你。”他说。

“谁？”我问。

“你来纽约详谈吧，一下子说不明白。”

“你的意思是他要见我？”

“是啊。”

“到底什么事？”

“你要是来了，他会亲自跟你讲。”卢修斯说。

“你写信给我不行吗？”

“不行。”

“那你透露点消息给我。”我提了一下请求。

“我不愿说。”

“那好吧，卢修斯。”我说，“那你直说，这一趟会不会让我白跑。”

“当然不会！来吧，好处多着呢。”

“透露一点儿风啊。”

“那可不能。”他说，“这对他不公平，况且我不知道他能帮你多少。不过你记住我说的话，必须要快些来纽约。”

“你确定他要见我？”

“就是你，不是其他人。我跟你讲，你赶紧来。把你要坐的火车告诉我，我去车站接你。”

“好吧。”我说完就挂了电话。

我不喜欢这么神神道道的，但我知道卢修斯人很好，他这样对我说必定有他的道理。我的芝加哥之行不算顺利，所以离开时并没有失落。如此下去，谁知道要到什么时候才能赚到足够的资金，像以前一样玩股票呢。

我再次回到纽约，不知道会发生什么事。真的，在去的路上，我不止一次担心什么事情都没有，我会浪费了车费，浪费了时间。谁知道我一生中最奇异的事情就这样拉开了帷幕。

在车站，卢修斯接到了我，然后他马上对我说，是非常著名的威廉森—布朗证券公司的丹尼尔·威廉森要见我。威廉森让卢修斯对我说，他为我做了一个交易方案，而且认为我一定会同意的，因为这能为我赚取大量的资金。卢修斯重申说，他对这个方案一点儿都不清楚。这个公司用信誉担保，没有什么特别的条件。

威廉森是这个公司的大股东。在19世纪70年代的时候，艾伯特·威廉森创立了这家公司。公司里没有一位叫布朗的合伙人，而且很多年来也没有一个这样的人。这家公司在丹尼尔老爹经营的时候名气很大，后来丹尼尔也继承了一大笔财产，就没再去做其他生意。公司有个以一抵百的客户，这个人就是威廉森的姐夫埃文·玛卡。这个人是十多家银行和信托公司的董事，而且也是奇萨比克大西洋铁路公司总裁。自詹姆斯·希尔之后，他是铁路领域里最牛的人物，也是实力雄厚的福特·道森帮派的发言人，是个重要角色。他个人有5000万到5亿美元资产，这估计是人们私下议论的。他死了以后，人们发现他的财产有2.5亿，都是从华尔街赚的。看，这是个大客户吧。

卢修斯对我说，他刚从威廉森的公司找了份工作，很适合他。他做的是在巡回中找业务的工作。公司在拓展代理业务，卢修斯建议威廉森开两个分公司，一个设在城中心的一家酒店里，一个设在芝加哥。我觉得他们可能想把后面这个分公司交给我经营——分公司经理，我可不干这个。我当时没有责怪卢修斯，心想等他们说了以后再推也行。

我跟着卢修斯到了威廉森的办公室，他介绍了我以后就出去了，好像不想见证他认识的两个人之间的交易。我想先听威廉森怎么说，然后再拒绝。

威廉森是个真正的绅士，让人如沐春风。他举止稳妥，一脸笑容，是个善于交际的人物，朋友肯定很多。他身体强壮，脾气又好，给人的印象特别好。而且他有那么多钱，别人也不会怀疑他图谋不轨。再加上他所受的教育和丰富的阅历，让他看起来礼貌而友好，还善于资助别人。

我沉默着，也没什么话要说，而且我一向就是先让别人说够，才开口说话的人。有人说过，当时的国家城市银行总裁詹姆斯·史迪曼——对了，他是威廉森的好友——有个习惯，就是会先毫无表情地听别人说话，等这个人说完后，史迪曼先生会继续看着他，依然不开口，就像这个人还没说完，因此这个人就觉得应该继续说。就这样，史迪曼光靠着凝视和倾听，经常使这个人提出比他开口时准备提出的还要优惠许多的条件来。

我不说话不是想引诱别人提出更好的条件，而是想把事情了解得更通透。听人说完了所有的话，你就可以立刻做决定，这是不浪费时间的做法，能够避免争吵，还省得讨论停不下来。就我参与的商业建议来说，基本上所有对我提出的与市场交易相关的建议，都在肯定或否定的结论中得以稳妥解决。我自己不了解全貌的话，是没法马上下结论的。

威廉森一直在说，我默默听着。他说他很早就知道我在股市上的一些传闻，也对我扬短避长地去做棉花期货的事情感到遗憾，同时也因为我赔本了，他才能够跟我见到面而感到幸运。他觉得我在炒股上的水平很高，是个天生的大玩家，不该离开股市。

“利文斯顿先生，这是我们想跟你合作的原因。”最后，他开心地说。

“怎么合作呢？”我问。

“你做经纪人。”他说，“我们公司希望接你的股票单子。”

“我倒愿意把单子交给你们。”我说，“可是不成啊。”

“为什么呢？”他问。

“我没钱。”我说道。

“这没有问题。”他笑着，“我给你钱。”他马上拿出一个支票本，开了一张2.5万美元的支票给我。

“这是？”我问道。

“存到你的账户里，你可以随时用。我希望你在我们公司做，我不在乎你是亏还是赚。如果这些钱损失殆尽了，我会再给你。所以，你不用太在意它。不知你听明白了没有？”

我知道他们公司很有实力，钱多得很，根本不需要任何人的业务，也用不着出钱给人当保证金。但威廉森却这么好心，给我的不是信用卡，而是现金，因此，只有他自己知道钱从哪里来。他唯一的条件是，如果我做交易的话，得通过他们公司成交，甚至还承诺在我赔钱后会继续出钱。这其中肯定是有原因的。

“到底什么意思？”我问。

“很简单，我们公司非常需要你这样的客户，大手笔的交易商。谁都知道你擅长大手笔地做空头，这是我喜欢你的地方。你是个大笔炒作的高手。”

“我还是不懂。”我说。

“利文斯顿先生，我明说了吧。我们有两三个非常富有的大客户，他们的股票玩得很大。我不想让华尔街人觉得，我们每次卖掉一两万股股票，都是他们在卖出做多的股票。要是你在这里，华尔街就不知道到底是你在做空，还是其他顾客把做多的股票卖到市场上。”

我终于明白了原委，他是要用我的名气来掩护他姐夫的操作。恰好一年半之前，我在空头上狠狠赚了一把。所以股价跌落的时候，华尔街那些爱嚼舌根子的人和愚不可及的造谣者们，就会理所当然地把责任归咎于我。一直到今天，股市行情不好的时候，我都被认为是罪魁祸首。

我用不着考虑，就能看出威廉森给我提供了一个快速上位的良机。我拿了支票，存到了银行，用他的公司开了账户，就开始行动了。市场行情非常好，很活跃，波动的范围很大，不用只盯着一两只特殊股。我说过，原本怕自己已经不会玩了，此时看来一点儿都没有。仅仅用了三周时间，我就用威廉森的2.5万美元赚了11.2万美元。

我找到威廉森说：“我把那2.5万还给你。”

“不用还。”他说着，挥手让我走，好像我给他递了一杯蓖麻油鸡尾酒一般，“不用，小兄弟，等你赚了大钱再说吧。别老记着这事儿了，你这才刚刚开始啊。”

我犯了个大错误，比在华尔街犯的其他错更让我后悔。多年来，这个错误让我很消沉很痛苦。我应该坚持把钱还给他。我正向着赚比亏损的钱还多的财富迈进，而且步伐很快。曾有三周，我的平均利润每周能有百分之一百五。自那以后，我开始稳当前行。可因为感激威廉森，我听他的，也没给他还那2.5万美元。当然，他没接受借给我的钱，我就觉得拿自己的利润不太好。我很感谢他，可是我天生不喜欢欠别人钱和人情。金钱的债务我可以用钱偿还，而人情和好心我也必须得用同样的东西去还。你很容易就看得出来，这些道德良心账常常是无法估价的，而且根本没有止境。

我又开始交易，而那些钱我放着没动。交易进行得很顺利。我觉得用不了多长时间，我就能恢复到1907年时候那样爽快的状态。要是恢复后，我需要做的就是先稳一下，不光是找回损失那么简单。赚或者赔，我都不太重视。令人开心的是我正在摆脱那种犯错的习惯，摆脱身不由己的习惯。几个月以来，这种习惯困扰着我，但是我已经吸取了教训。

就在此时，我放空了几只铁路公司的股票，包括奇萨比克大西洋铁路公司。我觉得就该做空，所以卖了8000股。

一天早上，我到市区去了，在市场开盘前，威廉森让我去他办公室。他对我说：“拉里，暂时不要动奇萨比克大西洋铁路公司的股票了。你放空8000股的操作真是太差劲了。今早我在伦敦给你平了仓，改成多头了。”

我确定奇萨比克大西洋铁路会下跌，行情记录说得很清楚。此外，我对整个市场都看空，但是看空的程度足以让我适量放空，并且觉得安全。我说：“你为什么要这样做？我看空整个市场，所有的股票都会下跌。”

可他只是摇头说：“我这么做，是因为我刚得知了一些你不知道的情况。我建议你，等我对你说可以放空了你再放空吧。”

我又能说什么？这不是的愚蠢的小道消息，是董事长姐夫的建议。威廉森不光是埃文·玛卡的老朋友，对我也是友好大方的。他信任我，也相信我说的话，我应该感激他才对，我不能造次。所以，我的情感又压倒了理智，我退步了。让我的判断臣服在他的意愿之下，正是我毁灭的开始。虽然感恩是一个有修养的人该具备的素质，可也不该用来绑架人。所以，我不光赔了利润，而且又欠了公司15万美元的债。我觉得很气恼，可是威廉森劝我不要担心。

“我会帮你过这个坎儿的。”他向我许诺，“我会这样做。不过，你得允许我这么做才行。你要停止自作主张地交易。我不能为你效劳，还允许你破坏了我之前对你的付出。你现在不要管市场的事情了，把为你赚钱的机会让给我吧。可不可以，拉里？”

我再问你，我能怎么办呢？我想着他的好，又不能做忘恩负义的事。我觉得这个人真不错，他很有风度，对人也很友善。我记得从他这里得到的，只有鼓励的言辞，他帮我建立了一切都会变好的信心。大约过了六个月，有一天他笑呵呵地来找我，给了我几张支票。

“我说过要帮你解决问题。”他说，“我现在实现了诺言。”然后我知道了，他不光消除了我的所有欠债，还送了我一笔小小的资金。

我觉得我会很轻而易举地赚到这些钱，因为市场行情很好，可他却说：“我替你买了南大西洋的1万股。”这是他姐夫埃文·玛卡控制的一条铁路，他也把控着这只股票的市场命运。

当有人像威廉森帮我一样帮你时，你能做的就是说句感谢的话，不管你怎么看待市场行情。你觉得自己是对的，可就像凯恩经常说的那句话：“你要下注后，才会知道结果。”威廉森就是用他自己的钱为我下了注。

好吧，南太平洋股票下跌了，一直处于低价位状态，我亏了钱，记不起亏了多少。威廉森为我卖掉了那1万股，我欠他的债更多了。但是，你这一生没见过一点儿都不令人烦恼和讨厌的债主吧，他一点儿都没有怨言，而且还努力说了些劝慰和鼓励我的话。最后，又是他慷慨地用神秘的方式为我结清了欠款。

他没告诉我其中的细节，全部都只是写在账本上的数字。威廉森对我说：“我用其他方面赚到的钱，给你补上了这笔亏损。”他还讲了怎样抛售了7500股其他的股票，并且赚了不少。老实说，在我得知所有债务都消除之前，我对自己之前的所有交易的细节都不太清楚。此事过后，我仔细想过几次，必须要从不同的角度来思考这件事，我也终究明白了里面的门道。显然，我是被威廉森长久利用的人，想到这一点，我就气不打一处来，更让我崩溃的是，我居然这么晚才明白。我仔细回忆了事情的经过，就去找威廉森了。我对他说，我和他公司之间已经没了情分，然后头也不回地离开了威廉森的公司。我没有说威廉森和他合伙人的任何坏话，就算说了又能起什么作用。可我也得承认，我对自己的气恼跟对威廉森—布朗公司的一样多。

我并不会因为赔本而生气，每次在股市赔本后，我都会从经历中学到一些东西。赔了些钱，从中吸取了教训，所以赔的钱就是应该付出的学费，要想获取经验，就需要付出一定的代价。可是在威廉森的公司，我获得的那些经验里有某种东西深深伤害了我，那就是失去了非常好的机会。赔钱了可以再赚，可像我遇到的那种机会，并不是随时都会有的。

你知道的，那时候的股市行情非常好。我对股市行情的分析也很正确，抓住机会就可以赚取几百万啊。可我让感恩之情压制了自己的步伐，束缚住了自己，只能做那些威廉森很和善地吩咐我做的事情。反正，这样的事情比跟亲戚一起做生意还让人心伤。

这还不算最糟糕的事情。最糟糕的是，从那以后，我其实已经完全失去了大赚的机会。市场崩溃了，行情一日不如一日。我不光丧失了手里的钱，还又让自己成了一个很大的债务人，比以前更严重。那几年是非常差劲的——从1911年到1914年。没有钱可以赚，也没有机会，导致我的生活比过去要糟糕很多。

如果把生意赔本与对以往不如意事情的悔恨掺和在一起，就会非常不痛快，这就是为什么我一直无法摆脱，这让我内心颇感焦灼。我明白，作为股票交易商，能暴露出来的缺点数量是没法计算的。于我而言，按照常人思维，在威廉森公司那样去交易是很正确的，可身为交易商，任由与自己的意愿不相符合的观点影响，既不正确又不明智。受恩不忘报的想法不该在炒股时出现，因为股市行情并没有骑士精神，也不奖励忠诚。我发现在当时没有自行决定的可能，我没有改变自己，仅仅因为我想继续在股市中交易。可是，事业就是事业，我就应该按照股票交易商的原则，坚持自己的判断。

这是一段奇特的过往。我会对你说这其中的门门道道。威廉森首次跟我见面时，说的话很诚恳。当他的公司买卖了几千股的任何一只股票时，华尔街上的人很快就会断定是埃文·玛卡在买进或卖出。他可是公司的大作手，只在这一家公司炒股，也是华尔街历史上很厉害又实力非凡的作手。唉，我被当作执行掩护任务的士兵一样使用，为埃文·玛卡的卖出做掩护。

我加入这家公司后没多久，埃文·玛卡就生病了，他很久之前就被下了死亡通知书。威廉森在埃文·玛卡自己知道这事之前就知道。这也是他为什么要买进我放空的那些股票的原因。他做的是把他姐夫手里的股票全部变成现金的勾当。

埃文·玛卡死后，财产管理人当然把他的投机和半投机股票全部卖掉。而到了那个时候，早已经是熊市了。威廉森设法照他那种样子控制着我，对玛卡的财产大有帮助。我说自己经验丰富，对股市的研究很正确，这并非吹牛。我在1907年成功做空的那件事情，我知道威廉森非常清楚。他不能冒着风险让我自由自在去做，原因何在？如果让我自由发挥，我会赚很多的钱，等他要把埃文·玛卡的个人资产变成现金的时候，我已经卖掉几十万股了。我是个活跃的空头行家，那将会给埃文·玛卡的继承人造成莫大的损失，因为他只留下2亿多资产。

他们让我欠账，再替我抹清债务，这比让我在其他地方猛烈地做空付出的代价要小很多。努力放空正是我应该要做的事情，如果不是因为威廉森的情面问题，我必定会努力放空。

我始终觉得，这是我身为股市作手的所有经验中最有趣却也最不幸的。我付出了莫大的代价，受到了很大的教训，延后我东山再起的时间很多年。我还年轻，有耐心去赚曾经赔掉的钱，但穷困五年时间可是很长的时间。不管年轻还是年老的人，都不喜欢穷困。生活中没有游艇，比没有市场交易要容易过。一辈子最好的机会就放在我的眼前，可是我却没有抓牢，而且我根本就不能伸手去抓。威廉森真是老奸巨猾，他狡猾老练，有眼光，聪明睿智，有胆量。他简直是个思想家，想象力丰富，能够抓住别人的弱点，毫不含糊地利用他。他自己预估情势，迅捷找到应对措施，让我在市场中变得丝毫没有抵抗力。他其实没有骗我半毛钱，相反的是，在钱上面，他表面上对我非常慷慨。他爱他的姐姐玛卡夫人，也尽到了身为兄弟的责任。





第十四章


离开威廉森的公司后，我一直心怀不满，它让我浪费了最好的交易时段。我经历了四年无钱可赚的漫长时段，没有一点儿收入，一分钱都没赚到。就像比尔·亨利奎兹说过的一句话：“市场冷淡得连臭鼬都没了味道。”

我感觉好像命中注定应该受困，可能这是上天的旨意吧，上天在历练我。说实话，我还没有自大到非得通过教训来惩罚自己的地步。在炒股经历中，我从没犯过一般傻瓜操作上的错误。我做的事情，或者说就是我没做的事情，是该在纽约金融区受表扬而非受谴责的事情。在华尔街，这件事很可笑，而且代价昂贵。但是这件事最糟糕的教训是不免让人认为，在股市上，你应该设法让自己略微减少一些人情味。

我离开威廉森的公司，到了其他地方去交易，在哪里都无钱可赚。我活该倒霉，因为我设法强迫市场给我不该给的东西，也就是给我赚钱的机会。想要得到通融很容易，认识我的那些人都对我充满了信任。我如果对你说，当我在股市中停止靠信用交易的时候，已经欠了别人100多万美元，你就知道他们对我的信任有多充分了。

并非我已经丧失了能力，而是在那困苦的四年中，根本就没有赚钱的机会。我想像以前一样埋头猛干，赚大钱，但结果却只会让欠款更多。因为我不想继续欠朋友们的钱，所以只好主动停止自行交易。此后，我靠着替别人管理账户来维持生活。他们都知道我非常懂行，就算市场不景气，也能游刃有余。如果获得利润，我就按照比例来获得提成——这时哪有半点利润？这就是我那时候的生活状况，应该说这就是我维持生活的办法。

话说回来，我也不是总在赔本，可就是还没有赚到更多的钱，来还我所欠的那些债。后来，情况变得更加不好，我平生首次有了一蹶不振的感觉。什么都不顺利，我从一个腰缠数百万、坐拥豪华游艇的富商，变成了一个债务缠身、生活拮据的人。我不喜欢这样的日子，但也顾不得自我可怜与抱怨。我不能就这么苦等时间来结束一切，要摆脱这种困境的方法只有一个，那就是赚钱。赚钱的办法就是去成功地交易。既然以前我这样交易过，那我就必须再接再厉。过去，我不止一次地靠着一点儿小钱，混成了资本大鳄，市场会把这个机会给我的。

我说服自己，认为不管有什么错误，都是我自己的错，一点儿都不能怪市场。那么我有什么问题呢？我秉持着一向研究不同阶段的交易问题时的精神，问自己这个问题，我冷静地分析了情势后，得出了结论：我的最大问题是担心我身上背负的那些债务，这个问题一直压迫着我。要讲清楚的是，这不光是欠账的心理在作祟。所有生意人在交易过程中都欠过别人的债务。我欠的债大多是商务债，是由不利于我的市场行情造成的。打个比方说，和商人遇到罕见而迁延很久的不正常气候相比，我的情形还没有那么严重。

日光如流水一般，因为还不上别人的钱，我对那些债务颇感烦躁。我需要说明：我欠着100多万，这都是在市场中损失的钱。很多人都对我很和善，没怎么为难我，只是有两个人总是纠缠我，一直跟在我屁股后面催债。我赚到点儿钱，他们就守在旁边，想搞明白有多少，逼我赶紧还账。有个人，我只欠他800美元，他还说要跟我上法庭，要扣押我的财产等，他竟然觉得我在藏匿财产，我对此很不理解，难道我看起来很不像即将穷困而死的无业游民？

我细心分析了炒股的问题，知道我需要做的是更加了解自己，而不是去研究股市行情。我沉着分析后明白：只要我一直担心，就不会有所作为，可显而易见的是，只要我欠着别人的账，就必定会心中忧虑。我说的意思是，只要那些曾借钱给我的人来找我的麻烦，或者逼我在取得足够的本钱之前就还他们钱，我就会这样。所以我就只能对自己说：“去办破产手续吧。”除此之外，我心里面的不快怎样才能消除呢？

这些听起来很容易，也很合理，是吧？但是，这么做就不光是令人不痛快了，我可以这样说，我痛恨那样做，痛恨让自己身处被人误解的处境。我个人没有看重过钱，从来没觉得要为了钱去说谎。可我明白，并非谁都会像我一样想问题。当然我同时也知道，如果状况变得好一点儿，我就会赶紧还钱，因为那种义务仍然存在。可我要是不用原来的方式交易，就丝毫没有还清100万的可能。

我鼓足勇气，去找债主。这是一件于我而言非常困难的事情，那些人大多是我的多年好友。我坦诚地把现状讲给他们听：“我并不是因为不想还你们钱才采用这个方法，而是为了对我们双方都公平，我要先解决赚钱的事情。过去两年，我断断续续地想着解决这个窘况的办法，一直不好意思出来对你们坦诚相告。如果我早这样做，就会对我们都有好处。我是说，如果这些账总逼迫我，让我心烦意乱，我就没法满血复活。如今我已经下定决心做一年前就该做的事。除此之外，我没有其他理由了。”

第一个出来说话的人代表他的公司，说出了所有债主想说的话。

“利文斯顿先生，”他说，“你说的意思我们都明白，我们也对你的现状非常理解。让我告诉你我们的想法：我们一定会让你解脱。请你让律师准备好你需要的东西，我们签字。”

这就是他们的想法，是华尔街好的那一面。那不光是对金钱满不在乎的天性，或者如体育赛事般公平竞争的风格，也是一种非常聪明的决定，因为这明显是正确的生意之道。我非常感谢这种美好的天性和精明的生意之道。

借款人对我共计100万的债务暂缓施压，可还是有两个小债主不想签字。其中一个就是我之前提到过的，欠他800美元的那个人。还有一个是我欠了6万美金的一家公司，他们已经破产了，接手的人不了解我，一天到晚地跟在我屁股后面。就算他们像其他大债主一样做，估计法院也不会让他们签字了结。总之，我走的破产程序，让我的破产账单上只有10万的债务，但是我实际欠了别人100万。

报纸报道了我的事情，真是让人不高兴。我从来都是欠钱就还的，从来不拖，这一次的事情深深伤害了我。我知道只要还在喘气，就要还清债务，但是，每一个看到那篇报道的人，不一定都明白我。看了那篇报道后，我都没脸出门见人了。但是，很快地，这种感觉消失了。很难形容，当清楚自己不会再受那些不明白你只有在毫无压力的情况下全身心投入市场，才能够成功交易的人的干扰后，心情是怎样的轻松愉悦，我感觉卸下了好大一个担子。

从债务围拢中解脱后，我想象着未来成功的美好光景，下一步要做的是积攒一些本钱。从1914年7月31日到12月中旬，股票交易所一直关闭，华尔街市场一片萧瑟。那么长时间没有一点儿交易，我欠着朋友的钱，他们对我很讲义气，我不好意思再向他们开口寻求资助，我也清楚那时没什么人能够助人到这种程度。

要寻得一笔合适的本钱非常困难，因为证券交易所关闭了，我不能要求任何一个经纪人帮我做点儿什么。我找了好几个地方，都没起到作用。

最后，在1915年2月，我只能去见威廉森。我对他说了我甩掉了债务的心理负担，要像原来一样交易。你可能记得，当初他用我的时候，我还没说话，他就急着让我用他的那2.5万美金。

而现在，当我需要他的时候，他却说：“当你觉得市场行情不错时，想买500股的话那你就去买吧，没有问题。”

我表达了谢意后离开了他。他原来总是阻止我，而他的公司却利用我赚了很多钱。一想到威廉森的公司不借给我足够的本钱，我就非常气愤。我觉得，刚开始进行交易，要稳当一些。如果有比500股多的钱来玩，我就能够更快更容易地恢复财力。可无论如何，情况就是这样的，这就是我东山再起的机会。

我离开威廉森的公司后，分析了市场行情，也反思了自己的弱点。当时是多头市场，这对我和其他成千上万的投资者都是一样清楚的，可我的那点儿资本只可以买到500股。我受到这样的限制，却没有任何其他办法。开始时，我就没法与哪怕一丁点儿的挫败相对抗。我一定要用这第一笔小资本筹得更多的钱。一开始买的500股必须要能赚钱，我必须赚到实实在在的资金。我知道除非有足够的本钱，才不会失去很好的判断；保证金不足，我就没办法在这个游戏中用冷酷而冷静的态度去交易。这个态度源于能承受一定损失的能力，就是我在大规模交易之前测试市场的那点儿损失。

此时，我深知自己处于一个股票投机客生涯中最重要的时刻。这次如果失败了，就算还有机会，也不知道从哪里、什么时候才能获取一笔钱，另外再尝试一次。显然，我需要一个最合适的时机。

我离威廉森的公司远远的，我是说在持续研判股市行情的六周之内，我从没到这家公司去。我害怕一旦到了公司看到交易大厅，知道能够交易500股，就会经不住诱惑而在不合时机的情况下出手交易不赚钱的股票。作为投机人，要研究市场基本行情，记住之前的经验，搞明白一般大众的心理和经纪人的受限因素，还需要认清自己的缺点。没有必要对自己身上的人性生气。我明白，了解自己和了解行情都非常重要。我细致分析思考自己在承受市场压力和活跃市场的诱惑力方面的反应，这样研究和估算时的心理和精神状态，很像我在思考谷物行情和收益报告时的状态。

所以，一天接着一天，我虽然一文不名，却急不可耐地等着进入股市。我坐在一家经纪公司的股市行情显示牌前面，不能进行交易，只能分析行情。我不让任何一条记录从我眼前溜走，我关注着股市上涨铃声响起的那一刻。

因为大家都熟识的因素，1915年前期的重要日子里，我很看好伯利恒钢铁公司的股票，我确定它会上涨。可为了确保首战告捷，我要等到它突破面值（100美元）之后再出手，我必须这么做才行。

我想我说过，我有这样的经验：不管何时，股票首次涨破100、200或300的时候，差不多就总会再继续涨30至50个点。超过300后，涨速还要快于突破100、200点后。我做得最成功的股票之一安纳康达就是这样，当它涨过200的时候我买了，一天后就到了260，然后我就卖掉了。我这样在股票刚刚突破票面价后买入的做法，在对赌行的时候就经常用，这是个很老的交易原则。

你能想象得出，我多么渴望恢复过去那种交易规模。我急于开始，什么都不想，可也能自我克制。就跟我想的一样，伯利恒的股票天天在涨，越涨越高。可我还是不允许自己贸然去威廉森的公司买进500股。我必须确保首次出手就赚钱。

那只股票每上涨1个点，就相当于我没有去赚500美元。上涨过了首次的10个点后，我就应该加码，如果那样，我现在手中就不是500股，而是有每上涨1个点就能赚1000美元的1000股了。可我仍然坐着不动，对自己的希望与信念在心中的呼唤充耳不闻，我只重视源于经验和常识的平稳安全的声音。我只要有足够的钱，就可以冒险，可我就是没有足够的钱，所以即使是冒小小的险，也是我完全无法承受的奢侈行为。不过，我最后还是遏制了自己的贪念和希望，忍耐了六周时间。

我开始犹豫了，就在那只股票突破90时。想到那些因我没买进而溜走的金钱啊，我的心在滴血。这只股票涨到98的时候，我心想它可能会突破100，只要等到了100，连房子都要被闹爆了，行情记录显示得很清楚。其实，记录上的内容谁都知道。这么对你说吧，当行情记录是98的时候，我就知道它肯定会到100。我清楚这不是我想要听到的、想要看到的，而是我对行情记录的本能反应。所以我想，不能等过了100再出手，此时此刻就要尽快买入，这只股票等于已经突破票面价了。

我匆匆赶到威廉森的公司，一次性买了500股伯利恒钢铁股票，当时的行情是98。我在98到99的时候，买了500股。之后到晚上收盘前，它疯狂涨到了114或者115，我就又买了500股。

次日，伯利恒钢铁的股票涨到了145，我有本钱了。等着股市上涨的六周，是我经历得最紧张焦灼的六周。不过，我的回报也来了，因为我此时已经有了足以让我大玩一把的本钱。如果一直玩500股的交易，我绝对不会有任何成就。

首次做对是很重要的，不管你从事哪一种行业都一样。在做了伯利恒的股票后，我接下来的操作都很顺利。真的，每笔都很帅，简直让我难以相信，这都是原来那个我在交易。但其实我已经脱胎换骨了，因为我原来备受骚扰、错误百出，现在却轻松愉快，正确无误。欠账的人不来找麻烦，我不会因为没钱而被打断交易，足够的资金对我耐心运用经验也不会造成影响，所以我在不断地获利。

就在我快要朝着目标财富挺进的时候，受“卢西塔尼亚号”被击沉的事件影响，股市猛然下跌了。每过一阵子，人总会在心窝被刺痛一下，这提醒人们，股市中没有永远的胜利，谁都会蒙受损失。据说，“卢西塔尼亚号”被击沉事件不该影响到那些专业的投资商，而且还不说他们在华尔街得知消息之前，就知道了这件事。我做了傻事，没有在提前听到消息后抽身出来。我要说的是，因为“卢西塔尼亚号”事件和我的缺乏预见造成了一两次损失，到1915年底的时候，我才发现我的保证金大概只有14万了，这就是我赚到的全部金钱，虽然这一整年我对市场的判断大部分都很正确。

接下来的一年，我做得也很好，运气也不错。在疯狂的多头市场中，我连战连捷，投资一直很顺畅。我不用考虑过多，只是一味地赚钱。这让我想起原来标准石油公司的已故人士罗杰斯的话，大概意思是，一个人赚钱的时机来临时，钞票挡也挡不住，就好比没有带雨伞，走到暴雨中，想要不被打湿很难。现在股市属于多头市场，大家都知道，协约国在美国购买物资，让美国成了世界上最发达昌盛的国家，拥有其他国家所没有的东西，世界各地的资金都源源不断地流入美国。我是说，这么大的世界，金子疯狂地流到这个国家来。通货膨胀也在情理之中，这说明所有东西的价格都在上涨。

一开始，什么都很明显，股价上涨是一点儿都没必要或者完全不需要炒作的。与多头市场相比，这就是准备工作少的原因。战争造成的繁荣局面，比其他因素引发的繁荣更顺理成章，而且为大家送来了很高的利润。就是说，1915年，人们从股市上赚取的钱比华尔街历史上任何一个繁荣时期赚得都多。人们没有把他们的全部账面利润完全套现，变成确实的现金，或是没有长期保有真正已经落袋的获利，只是历史自行重复而已。在华尔街，历史一次次地重演，比其他任何地方都频繁、有规律。当你读到有关那时候或兴或衰的文字记录时，你会发现，现在的股票投机和股票投机客跟以前相比，没有多大的区别。这个游戏本身没发生多少改变，人性也没发生多大的变化。

1916年，我跟着股市上涨的趋势炒股，与很多人一样乐观，同时也保持着警惕心。就像谁都清楚的那样，我也明白什么事情都有结束的时候，所以随时注意着各种迹象。我并不喜欢猜测那些迹象从哪里来，所以并不专注于一个地方。我不会，也没觉得自己会对市场的某个侧面情有独钟。多头市场让我的存款变多了，或是空头市场对我特别慷慨，我都认为不是充足的理由，不足以让我坚守多头或空头。人不该誓死对多头或空头效忠。你唯一关心的是要正确。

还有一件事要记住，就是股市没有鼎盛的终点，也不会突然以其相反的形式结束。股市或许常在整体下跌前很久就失去了多头市场。我明白了这点时，等了好久的警示迹象一个个出现了，在股市中一直跑在前面的股票，从高处跌落了几个点，属于好几个月以来的首次下跌，而且没有再涨回去。显然，我需要赶紧调整战术了。

要转变也很简单。在多头市场，股价大势一定是向上走的，所以要是有一只股票与之走向不符，你就可以假设它肯定是哪里有问题了。这足够让老到的投机者们深感不对劲。他根本不需要看行情记录，只用等着行情记录说：“撤！”而不是等待行情记录发出合法的批准文件。

就像刚刚说的，我看到那些冲在前面的股票没有了上涨的势头，已经下跌了六七个点，然后停住不动了。同时，其他股票还在一直上涨。这些上市公司内部都没问题，所以原因出在别处。那些股票上涨了几个月后突然停下来，虽然多头还是很猛烈，可却昭示着那些特定股票上涨的终结。股市上的另一些股票还在稳步上涨。

根本没必要慌乱，进而原地踟蹰。我在此时并没卖空，我看行情记录还不到那一步。多头市场结束的日子还没有来到，但是已经近在咫尺。在它来之前，还能做多头来赚钱。情况是这样，我只是看坏已经停止上涨的股票，因为市场上还有其他股票在上涨，我一边买进，一边卖出。

我卖空了已不再保持领先的那些股票，每只我都卖掉了5000股。然后我把新冲上去的股票做多。我手里做空的股票不怎么涨，而做多的在不停地上涨。等它们不再涨的时候，我就又卖掉，开始做空，每只股票各放空5000股。此时，我卖空的比买进的要多，因为很显然，下次要在股市下跌时大赚一笔。当我确定了牛市还没结束，熊市就已开始的时候，就知道赚钱的卖空的时机还不成熟。低调不动肯定不行，但可也不能太急躁。行情记录表明不景气的熊市快来了，此时应该做好准备。

我不断地买卖，一直持续了一个月，我按照每次5000股，共做空了6万股，是十几只不同股票。它们在这一年一开始是很受欢迎的，因为一直处于活跃上涨领先状态。这6万股不是很大的空头部位，但是不要忘记，股市并没有确定走空。

可是，终于有一天，股市疲软了下来，所有的股价开始下跌。在我卖出的十二只股票中，每只都赚了至少4个点，说明我的头寸没有出错。行情记录表明，这个时候做空就是安全的，所以我立刻加码一倍。

我建立了自己的空头头寸，此时这样的空头市场中，我放空手中掌握的股票。我根本没必要去打压，股市一定会和我的预估相符。清楚了这一点，我就可以安心等着。在我加码一倍以后，我有一大段时间没有交易。大概在我建立全部放空头寸六周后，发生了大家都知道的泄密事件，从而引发了股市的暴跌。

我听说，有人事先从华盛顿知道了一个消息，说威尔逊总统很快就要发布一个能为欧洲带来和平的政令。世界大战促成了战时的经济繁荣，也维持了很长时间，而伴随和平而来的自然就是熊市。当一个精明的投资人被指控说利用这个消息赚取利润的时候，他说自己卖掉股票不是靠消息，而是他觉得市场已经活跃过头了。而我，在此前七周就成倍增持了空头头寸。

听到了股市要暴跌的消息，我就做了应对，这是唯一合理的做法。在做计划的时候，如果发生了你没有估算到的事情，就该借助命运之神提供的机遇。原因之一是，股市如此暴跌，就会出现一个大市场，大到你可以利用这个市场，把你的账面利润转为现金。就算在空头市场，一个人回补了12万股，也不可能不让股价抬高。因此他必须要等市场给予的这个机会，买进这么多股票，而不致使账面利润受到影响。

我要说的是，我并非是借这么个特殊理由，在这样的时候指望股市能有异常大跌。恰恰相反，就像我说过的，身为专业作手，我有30年的炒股经验，它告诉我，这样的情况一般会朝着阻力最小的方向前行，我的理论就建立在这一点上。另外需要记住的是，千万不要想着在价格最高的时候放空，这是很不聪明的做法。如果没有迹象表明股价会止跌，而且要强势反弹，就要等市场回调后抛出。

1916年，我靠着在多头市场的持续做多，和在空头市场一开始就做空，赚取了300多万。我之前说过，没有必要坚持守住市场的一个面做交易。

那一年的冬天，我跟前几年一样，因为特别喜欢钓鱼而去了棕榈滩度假。我在炒股的同时，也在小麦期货中做空，两种交易都为我创造了很大的利润。没有烦恼事情影响，我的假期很愉快。只是，我没有去欧洲，也就不可能正儿八经与股票和期货市场斩断联系，比如我在纽约北部城市安迪若恩达克斯的家中，就安装了与纽约经纪公司相通的电话线。

在棕榈滩时，我养成了定期去经纪商分公司的习惯。我发现棉花市场很强劲，价格在上涨。大概在那时候，也就是1917年，有很多与威尔逊总统为和平而努力的事情传到了我的耳朵里。这些报道全是从华盛顿传来的，我是从新闻和棕榈滩朋友处获知的。这些致使我在某一天产生了这样的想法：各个市场的运行都与威尔逊是否成功有关。如果和平即将到来，股票和小麦期货应该下跌，棉花应该上涨。不管股票与小麦的市场如何发展，我已经准备好了一切，可棉花，我却已经很久没有碰它了。

有一天下午两点二十，我一包棉花都没买，可过了五分钟，我就觉得和平已经临近了，所以一下子买了1.5万包。我打算按照原来的老办法玩，这种玩法我之前说过。

那天下午股市收盘后，我们收到了德国的“无限制战争”声明，没有其他办法了，只有等隔日股市开盘后再看。我记得那晚在葛丽莱俱乐部，一位美国的工业大亨想以比那天收盘价低5个点的价格卖掉手中的美国钢铁公司股票。几个匹兹堡的百万富翁也在场，但没有人愿意买，他们觉得只要买了就会有很大的亏损。

事情果然是这样，你能够想象，第二天早上股市和期货市场一片混乱，有的股票开盘价比头天晚上收盘时低了8个点。而这正好是老天所赐的一个回补空头头寸的良机。我提到过，在熊市的时候，股市如果忽然混乱了，买进就是个好办法。你如果掌控得够好，就是个将一大笔浮动利润转化成现金的唯一时机。比如，我做了5万股钢铁公司的空头，同时也做了其他公司的空头，等我有了买进的机会时，我就会回补。我赚了大约150万美元。这是个不可小觑的机会。

在头一天收盘前半小时，我买进的那1.5万包棉花，一开盘就跌了500点，这太吓人了，我一夜之间赔了37.5万美元。此时，在股票和小麦期货上，正确的做法就是在下跌前平了空头，可我却在棉花期货上犹豫，不知道该怎么做才对。有很多需要考虑的事情，而且我在即将弥补损失时却认为自己错了，因为我不想在当天贸然挽回损失。接着我想到，我来南方是要过一段愉快的钓鱼日子，而不是被棉花市场的走势所困。我在股票和小麦期货市场上赚钱了，同时也在棉花市场遭受了损失。我这就能算出，我将获得的利润并非150多万，而是100万多一些。这纯属会计的事情，当你提出了很多问题后，他就是这样告诉你不怎么精确的数字的。

如果我在前一天收盘前没买棉花，我就不会赔损40万。这说明，当人在投资方面出现失误时，不管多么小的失误，就可能迅速亏掉大钱。我的主要寸头是完全正确的，而且我在一个与自己的考量相悖的偶发事情中，获得了利益。你看，最小阻力线的交易价值又一次出现在了交易商面前。虽然德国人的声明造成无法预料的市场因素，可股市走向还是在我的预料之中。要是事实证明我所料不错，那我的三笔投入就完全是对的。随着和平时期的到来，股票和小麦会下跌，而棉花会大涨，这三笔投入就是全赚。无论战争还是和平，我在股市和小麦期货的头寸都是正确无误的，这是突发事件助我赚钱的原因。在棉花期货市场上，我的投资是基于市场之外的事情，也就是说，我把考量因素集中到了威尔逊的和平谈判上，是德国军方的那些人使我在棉花市场遭受了损失。

我在1917年初回到纽约后，就还清了所有的欠债，一共100多万，这对我来说是一件大快心意的事情。本来，我可以在几个月前就能还清，只是有个小原因致使我没有还账。那时，我正处在交易期，做得很不错，正是我需要钱的时候。我得用我赚的钱和他们的钱，在1915年和1916年的繁荣市场中，利用好所有的时机。我清楚会大赚，不需要为此担心，所以我让他们再耐心等我几个月，而其中有的人甚至不指望能要回欠款了。我不想每次还一点儿，或者每次还一个人，我要还钱就一次性全部还清所有人的债务。所以，只要市场尽其所能地帮助我，我就会利用手中所有的资金去交易。

我提出了支付利息的想法，可所有与我签过拖欠协议的人都不要利息。我最后还清债务的那人，就是那个我欠了800美元的人。那时候，他给我增添了不少压力，让我非常不爽，不能轻松地去赚钱。我把他放到最后，一直到他知道我还清了其他所有人的欠账，他才拿到了那点儿钱。我想让他学会在别人欠他几百美元的时候，要换位思考。

这就是我东山再起的过程。

还清了全部欠款后，我支出了一大笔钱作为年度消费金，我发誓不再像以前那样，因为身上没钱而心情沮丧，从而让投资也非常不顺利。而且，我结婚后，也给了妻子一笔资金，孩子出生后，我又为孩子留了一笔钱。

我这么行事，不光是害怕多变的市场再次让我变成穷光蛋，而是我明白谁都可能把自己轻易获取的东西浪费光。安排好了以后，妻子和孩子就不会因为我炒股而生活受到影响。

我认识的很多人都像我一样，安排自己的生活。可是，当他们再次需要钱的时候，又穷尽手段哄妻子签字把钱交给他们用，他们拿去后就又亏损在了市场里。可是，我做得很妥当，不管我想做什么，或者妻子要拿钱为我做什么，那张托管协议都不会允许，一分钱都不能动。这是一笔安全的资金，我和妻子都不能随便挪用它，它不会受市场需求的影响，甚至不会受好妻子的爱心影响，我绝不冒险。





第十五章


在市场投机过程中，出现无法预估的事情的可能性很大，风险非常高。有些风险，很多非常谨慎的人都该承受，他如果想在市场上不那么畏畏缩缩，就要承担风险。正常的商业风险，没有出门逛街或者坐火车旅行那么危险。我对受到无法预测的事情而赔本的情势的怨恨不会比对来得不是时候的暴风雨更多。从摇篮到坟墓，这个生命的过程本身就是一场赌博。我没法预知未来，所以对遇到的所有事情都可以承受，不觉得受到困扰。不过，在我从事投机事业的生涯里，有几次我判断正确，操作也没错，却被一些宵小之徒卑鄙地骗走了获利。

一个反应迅捷和眼光深远的人会通过对骗子、懦夫和乌合之众进行反击而保护自己。除了在以前的一些对赌行里以外，我从来没有遇到十分卑鄙、恶劣的不诚实做法，就算在对赌行那样的地方，诚实也是最可取的准则。赚大钱需要公平公正地赚，而不是通过欺诈与蒙骗。我不觉得随时随地都必须放亮眼睛以免上当是好的市场交易行为。不过，一个正直的人遇到那种卑劣的人是丝毫没办法的。公平竞争就是公平竞争。我还可以说出十几个例子来，在这些活生生的实例中，我都是因为一言九鼎或者相信别人能够一言九鼎而受到损害。不过这些事情我不会讲出来的，已经没什么意义了。

有很多人，比如小说家、宗教人士或者妇女们，都觉得股票交易所是贿赂公行的战场，或是把华尔街人的日常业务说成是一场战争。这种说法相当耸动，却彻底误导了大家。我不觉得我的副业是引发冲突或者发动战争。我从来没有对哪个人或群体发过战书，只是各自有不同的看法，不同的观点，仅此而已。戏剧家们所谓的那种商战，不是人与人之间的战争，而是商业观念上的较量。我努力去相信事实，并且据此行动，这就是贝纳德·巴鲁奇能够成功的秘诀。有时候，我没有完全看清客观事实，或者没有及时了解全部的事实，或者没有做出合理的推论。一旦出现这种情况，我就会亏钱。只要一出错，代价就是付出金钱。

凡是理智的人，都不会反对为自己所犯的错付出代价。谁犯了错都要有代价，这是普遍规律。可我在对的时候，就很反对亏钱。我说的不是那种因为交易所规则突然改变让我付出了金钱的某些交易。我想到的是交易中的一些偶发事件，它们会经常提醒我：只有将钱存到自己的银行账户上后，才算是实打实的利润。

世界大战在欧洲爆发后，急需品价格上涨，人们对这样的情况非常容易估计到，正如人们觉得战争会导致通货膨胀一样。战争一直在持续，物价也在跟着上涨。你可能记得我之前说的，我在1915年的时候，忙的都是怎么样翻身的事情。股市热潮出现，抓住这个机会是我必须要做的。我做过的最稳当、最容易实现、最迅速的大事都是在股市中进行的，而且我很幸运，这件事你已经知道。

到了1917年7月，我不光能够还清债务，还有一定的结余，这说明我已经有了同时去做股票和期货交易的时间、资本和意愿。这么多年，研究交易市场，已经成了我的习惯。期货市场的商品，除了咖啡，价格都比战争之前上涨了1到4倍。这是有原因的，战争导致了欧洲商品市场被迫关闭，大量的咖啡被运到了市场广阔的美国，所以美国国内咖啡原料积压过多，导致咖啡价格下跌。我开始考虑咖啡投资的可能性时，它的价格已经低于战争之前的价格。造成这个反常现象的原因很明显，而更明显的是，德国和奥地利不断地对同盟国船只展开攻击，致使能用在商业方面的船数量减少，这也造成了咖啡进口生意不景气。随着时间的推移，咖啡进口减少，人们的消费速度却没有变化，积压的咖啡终会被消费掉，所以当这样的局面出现时，咖啡价格一定跟其他商品一样猛涨。

不需要有福尔摩斯的智慧就足以分析出这个情况。可为什么人们都不买咖啡，我却不知道原因。当我决定要买的时候，不觉得这是一种投机行为，而更像是商业投资。我知道想赚钱得需要时间，可我知道这个投资会产生很大的利润。这就使得买进咖啡成了保守的投资行为，是银行家而不是投机者的操作。

1917年冬天，我开始着手收购咖啡，买进了大量的咖啡。可是，市场却没有什么反响，还是那样的萧条，价格也并非我预想的那样会上涨，所以我手里握着没有前途的合约长达九个月之久。

九个月后，合同到期，我只好卖掉平仓，这让我又赔了一大笔钱。不过，我觉得我的分析并非没有道理，显然我是拿捏错了时机，我确定咖啡一定会跟其他东西一样涨价。所以，我刚一卖掉，就又立刻买入，而且是上一次买入的3倍。当然了，我买的是尽可能长久握在手里的期权合约。

这一次我可没有出错。我买进三倍的数量后不久，咖啡价格就开始上涨，每个人都好像一下子明白过来了，知道咖啡市场要出现什么情形。从市场行情来看，我的投资好像快要收到巨额回报了。

卖咖啡的人是咖啡烘烤业者，大多数是德国人或者是和德国有关系的商家，他们信心十足地从巴西买到咖啡后非常想运送到美国，可是没有货船。不久之后，他们发现自己处于非常紧迫的状态，一方面在遥远的南美洲那里，有无穷无尽的咖啡供应，另一方面又在美国大量放空给我。

请记住，咖啡价格处于世界大战之前的水平时，我开始看好它；也别忘了，我买了以后，被套牢了大半年，承受了庞大的亏损。亏本是对错误的惩罚，而赚钱就是对正确的奖励。因为这次做得非常正确，也属于长线投资，我绝对有理由可以赚一大笔。要赚到让自己满意的利润，并不需要市场价格涨多高，我手里可是有几十万袋咖啡。我不喜欢说能操作多少多少，这些数字听起来似乎有些不可能一样，人们会认为我是在说大话。其实我只是根据自己的财力操作，也为自己留足了投资安全的余地，在这个例子中我够谨慎了。我买了这么多咖啡期权，是因为感觉不会赔本，情况对我有利。我已经等待了一年时间，现在耐心等待和操作正确无误会让我得到报酬。我知道利润会源源不断地涌来，非常猛烈。这当中没有什么巧妙，而仅仅是因为我不盲目而已。

几百万的赚头确实很快就来了，可是钞票根本没到我手中。不是形势突然发生了变化，美国国内的市场没有转变，咖啡也没有涌进美国。到底出了什么事情呢？真是难以预料，是任何人都没遇到过的，我也没办法提前防范的事情。在投资过程中，那一连串的突发事件里，必须得加上这一件令我永远记住的事情了。这就是，那些卖给我咖啡的空头们，非常明白自己面临的现实情况，所以尽力摆脱现状，他们要把手里的咖啡抛售出去，想出了新的欺骗方式。他们匆忙来到华盛顿寻求帮助，而且确实得到了协助。

你可能记得，政府以前制定过很多条例，防止民生必需品遭到囤积居奇。你知道的，大多数都发挥了作用。呃，那些大慈大悲的咖啡商们跑到了战时的价格管制委员会，打着爱国的幌子，为美国人的早餐申请权利。这个委员会说，一个叫劳伦斯·利文斯顿的职业投机商可能垄断了咖啡，他想利用世界大战创造的条件，赚取巨额利润，而美国人不得不用很昂贵的价格来买每天的必需品——咖啡。那些卖给我几船咖啡却没有船只运送的爱国者，根本无法想象，1亿美国人或多或少要向没有良心的投机分子致意。他们代表的是咖啡这一行，而不是炒作咖啡的赌客，他们情愿帮政府打压市场上的或者可能出现在市场中的暴利投机行为。

现在有一大堆人抱怨我，我并不是暗示价格管制委员会没尽到职责去管控囤积居奇和浪费行为，我更想表达出我的看法，他们可能没有很深入地研究咖啡市场。他们制定了咖啡原料的限价，也定了个终止现有咖啡合同的期限。这就说明咖啡市场的交易马上要停了，我只有一件事可以做，就是卖掉所有的咖啡合约。正如之前曾赚几百万时一样，这次我认定能赚的几百万打了水漂。我从来都是强烈反对在生活必需品行业牟利，可当价格管制委员会制定咖啡条例前，所有的其他商品价格都已经比大战之前高了2.5到4倍，可咖啡价格实际上比战前那几年的均价还低呢。我觉得咖啡在谁手中都一个样，价格肯定要上涨，不是因为那些无情的投机分子操控了，而是咖啡数量越来越少。这是进口的数量越来越少导致的，而进口数量的减少又是由德国潜艇对船只的轰炸造成的。价格管制委员会还没等咖啡涨价，就采取了限价行动。

作为一种政策和没办法的办法，强迫市场停止咖啡交易简直是个错误。如果这个价格管制委员会允许咖啡交易正常进行，咖啡价格就会因为之前说过的其实与垄断没有丝毫关系的原因上涨。而且这样的上涨，不需要太高，就会起到刺激作用，让咖啡供给回到市场中来。我曾经听贝纳德·巴鲁奇提到过，战时工业委员会规定价格的时候，考虑过为市场做担保这个因素，所以一些针对某些商品的高价限制所发的怨言就很不公平了。后来，咖啡市场交易重新回归后，咖啡的价格达到了每磅23美分。供应量太少，美国人还是得掏腰包。同时因为那些慈悲为怀的空头的建议导致定价过低，使得连高价运费都没办法支付，进口量就变得很少，因此咖啡在美国的供应也就很少。

我一直觉得，在我所有的商品交易中，这笔咖啡的交易才是最合情合理合法的。我认为这是商业投资，而不是投机行为。我投资了咖啡一年多时间，要是真说其中有赌博因素的话，那也是那些有德国姓氏和血统的爱国者在赌博。他们在巴西买了咖啡，运回到纽约卖给我。价格管制委员会又管制了唯一没有上涨的商品价格，在暴利交易出现之前，对大众的利益起到了保护作用。可是，却没有抵挡得了随后无可避免的价格上涨。不光是这样，而且当生咖啡豆在每磅9美分盘旋时，烘干咖啡跟其他商品一样，价格在上涨，其实只有那些烘烤商人赚了钱。如果生咖啡豆每磅能涨价两三美分的话，我就会赚几百万美元，同时大众也不会在后来咖啡暴涨时付出那么高的代价了。

事后为投机验尸是浪费时间，不过像这样的特殊交易，却很有总结的价值。它跟我之前所做的所有交易一样顺利。价格上涨是显而易见的趋势，什么都符合规律，让我觉得不赚到那几百万都不可能，可是结果却真的没有赚到。

另外有两次，我是被那个委员会的规定所害，他们提前没有任何警示，就直接改变了交易规则。但是这两次，从方法的角度来看，我的所作所为是没问题的，只是没有我在咖啡投资交易时那么符合商业标准。在投机交易上，没有什么事情能够绝对确定。我刚说的那段经历，又为我那些意外事故增添了更多不可预估的因素。

这次咖啡投资事情过后，我在其他股票和期货买卖的交易上都做得很好，所以又听到了很多关于我的谈资。在华尔街，那些职业玩家和新闻记者看到市价出现无法避免的崩跌时，总习惯指责我，明里暗里地说是我在背后搞鬼。有时，说我所做的交易是不爱国的行为，却不管真正卖出的人是不是我。我觉得他们无端放大我在投资交易上的规模与影响，就是为了替人们找一个市价变动的理由，满足他们贪婪的需求。

我都说过一千次了，不论哪种操作手段，都不可能让股票价格下跌或者一直处在低价水平。这一点儿都不算神秘。任何一个人，只要不嫌麻烦的话，想上一会儿，就能清楚地得到答案。假设有个作手掼压一只股票，也就是让价格降到比实际价值更低的程度，一定会发生什么事情？嗯，聪明的内线人士就会迅速利用时机买进。能确定股票真正价值的人，总是会趁着股价低廉时买进股票。如果内线们不买进了，原因就是他们不看好股市行情，没办法自由支配足够的钱，这就不是多头的行情。人们在议论空头掼压时，总是认为掼压没有道理，甚至是犯罪。但是，把一只股票打压到远低于真正价值的水准，是非常危险的事情。要深深记住，那些被人操控着的，没有价格回升希望的股票，是不能够买的；只要有不正当卖空行为，使股价下跌猛烈，就容易引发买进行为，不管什么时候出现这样的事情，价格都不可能维持在低档。我应该说百分之九十九所谓的惯压，其实是合法合理的股价下跌，而且常常会加速下跌。不过，这种下跌并非主要是由哪个职业投机者造成的，无论他玩的是多大规模的投资。

那些认为股价突然下跌，或者出现比较异常的暴涨现象，都是由疯狂的幕后投机分子的投机行为造成的说法，都可能是编造的，只是为了提供给那些不用脑子思考，只知道盲目偏信的赌徒听，让他们得到个股价变动的解释。运气不好的投机者动不动就会在经纪人或者喜欢以讹传讹的人们口中听闻，说自己的亏损与股价变动都是幕后炒作的结果。这其实是一种反面的内幕消息。其中的区别是，空头的内幕消息是很清晰的，明确建议卖空，而反面的内幕消息就是一种没有给出说法的说法，它的作用其实是阻止了你卖空的明智决定。股票在下跌时，卖掉是自然而然的事，这一定是有理由的，是一个不知道原因但必定非常好的理由。所以，就应该脱手。可是，如果股价下跌是由幕后操控导致的，那脱手就不是聪明的做法。操纵者只要停止打压股市，价格就会马上反弹。这就是反面的内幕消息。





第十六章


内幕消息！人们是多么渴望知道内幕消息啊。不光渴望得到，还喜欢告诉别人。这是贪婪欲与虚荣心在作祟。每当见到那些很聪明的人到处获取内幕消息，就感觉很好笑。喜欢传播消息的人，不会管消息的好坏，因为需要消息的人并非只想得到好的消息，而是想得到所有的内幕消息。内幕消息如果有好处，那就好极了；如果没有，下一个会带来好运。我想到的是那些身在交易大厅里的散户。不过，有一些股票炒手和作手却从头到尾总是很相信内幕消息。于他们而言，一拨又一拨的内幕消息就是一种非常好的宣传方式，是世界上最好的促销剂。因为想得到消息的人和放出消息的人都会传播消息，所以内幕消息的散播就会发生连锁反应。传播内幕消息的人认为，没有谁能抵挡得了合理传播的内幕消息，顶着这样的假象，他们四处传播，也研究过怎么样才能非常巧妙地把消息扩散出去。

每天我都能从各色人口中听到好多内幕消息，我要讲个婆罗洲锡业公司的故事。你记得它上市时候是什么情形吗？那可是股市最繁荣的时候。他们公司按照一位智慧过人的银行家的建议，立马在公开市场上出售新上市公司的股票，而不是交给承销团去慢慢消化。这是个好建议，不过他们唯一的错就出在了经验不足上。他们不知道股市行情特别好的时候，股价是多么疯狂，而且他们又畏首畏尾，聪明不足。他们同意根据市场需求抬高价格销售股票，可是挂牌的价格却高得出奇，致使交易的人们和投机开拓者们买进股票的时候疑虑重重。

按照道理来说，公司必定会陷在进退两难的困境中，可是在疯狂的牛市，他们的贪心却变得特别保守。只要有一点儿内幕消息，人们什么股票都买进，根本不考虑什么投资不投资的，只想着轻松地赚点钱，靠着赌博性质的做法赚一次是一次。各个国家都在购买大量的军用物资，所以金钱如流水一般涌入美国。人们说，公司在制订婆罗洲锡业上市计划的时候，曾经三次提高开盘价格，最后才完成了第一笔交易。

也有人想让我加入，我调查了一下后没有接受邀请，因为如果要在市场操作的话，我喜欢单枪匹马做事，按照自己的方式来交易。婆罗洲锡业公司上市的时候，我调研了他们公司的财务情况、行动方案以及人们会形成何等疯狂的景象后，在首次交易那天的第一个小时内，就买进了1万股。从某个角度来说，这个股票的初次发行是成功的。事实上，当公司看到股民们这么疯狂地买了他们的股票后，就觉得这么快就放掉很多股票个错误。他们得知我买了1万股时，觉得就算把股价多抬高百分之二十五或者百分之三十，照样可以卖完。所以他们认为我买那1万股可能得到的利润，会占去他们的几百万美元利润当中的很大份额，因此就停止了炒作，还想把我挤出去，但我就是岿然不动。他们拿我没办法，觉得是运气不佳，就放弃了对我采取的行动，免得不小心失去对市场的控制。接着，他们开始拉抬股份，但是放掉的股数都在他们的可控范围内。

他们看到其他股票涨得非常离谱，就想着自己能赚到巨大的利润。婆罗洲锡业公司股票上涨到了120点的时候，我一次性把1万股全部卖给了他们，对股票的上涨起到了压制作用，于是公司负责人就放弃了拉高价格的做法。接下来股价反弹时，他们又想办法让这只股票引人追捧，调节了一大部分的持股情况。可后来的事实证明，拉抬股价的成本很高，最后他们把股票价格拉高到了150。股市此时逐渐冷淡，这个公司没办法，只好尽力往外卖出股票，抛给那些总喜欢在回落时买进的投机者。这些人离谱地臆想，原来150的股票，降到130就是非常便宜的了，而下跌到120美元，那简直就是捡了个大便宜。公司制造内幕消息，让交易场内的股民们都知道，然后制造出一个短暂的回光返照的繁荣局面。后来，公司也会放一些消息给交易所，反正哪种旁门左道都能起到一点儿作用，他们想方设法用尽了自己会的所有伎俩。只是，那种适合做多的好时节已经过去了，笨蛋们已经吞下了其他的诱饵。婆罗洲锡业公司的人没有看清现状，或者根本就是看明白了但不愿意接受罢了。

我和妻子去了南边的棕榈滩度假。有一天，我在葛丽莱小赚了一把，回到家拿出500美元给妻子。这是很奇异的巧合。在那天晚上吃饭的时候，妻子遇到了婆罗洲锡业公司的总裁维森斯坦先生，他就是这个公司那一伙股票发行人的老大。很久后，我才明白，他坐在我妻子旁边是花了一番心思的。

他想尽办法讨好我的妻子，最后还神秘地对她说：“利文斯顿夫人，我打算干一件从来没有干过的事情，我非常乐意去做，因为你明白这里面的意义。”他停住不说，着急地看着我妻子，想知道她有多聪明谨慎。我妻子看出了他明摆在神态中的意思。不过，我妻子只是随口应道：“我明白。”

“那好，利文斯顿夫人，我非常荣幸和你们夫妻二人见面。为了证明我的诚心，因为我希望能与你们长久交往。我确定不用我说，你也应该知道我要说的话是机密。”接着，他压低了声音，“如果你们买进婆罗洲锡业公司的股票，一定会赚一笔大钱。”

“是吗？”我妻子问。

“我刚从旅店离开的时候，”他说，“收到了几封电报，内容是需要对大众保密几天的。我准备尽力多买进一些这只股票。明天开盘的时候，如果你要买，就跟我一起按照一样的价格买吧。我保证婆罗洲锡业股票百分之百会大涨。我只把这个消息告诉了你一个人，绝对没有第二个人知道。”

妻子表达了谢意，然后对他说，自己一点儿都不懂股市。他就对我妻子说，只要知道这个消息就够了，其他也没必要懂。为了让她确定无疑地明白，他重复了一下自己的话。

“你只要尽量买进你想买的婆罗洲锡业公司的股票。我绝对保证，你这样做不会有损失。我这辈子，还从来没劝过哪个女人或男人去买哪家股票呢。我非常有把握，这只股票不会停在200点以下，我只想让你们多赚些钱。你应该明白，我一个人不可能买进所有股票的。除了我以外，如果还有人能从中获利，我希望是你们夫妻二人，而不是一些陌生人。我偷偷对你说，因为我知道你不会到处乱说的。利文斯顿夫人，请按照我说的话，买进婆罗洲锡业吧。”

他说得一本正经，所以我妻子相信了他的话。她就想把我给她的500美元物尽其用。这点儿钱于我而言不算什么，完全是由她自由花销的。也就是说，就算她运气差，也就亏损这么一点儿而已。而且，那人保证了她一定能赚。要是她能靠自己的力量赚钱——事后，她才告诉了我真相——一定棒极了。

嗯，是这样，就在次日早上开盘前，我妻子走进了哈丁兄弟公司，对经理说：“哈利先生，我想买些股票，可我不想用我常用的账户。在赚钱之前，我不想让我家先生知道。你可以帮忙安排吗？”

经理说：“哦，没问题。我们单独开一个户头就可以。哪只股票？你要买多少股？”

妻子把500美元给他，说：“你听好，我可不想赔光本钱，如果这些钱赔了，我不想欠账。你记住哦，不要让利文斯顿先生知道这件事。请你在开盘时，用这些钱买婆罗洲锡业公司的股票。”

哈利接过钱后，答应她不会对外透露半点儿消息，然后在开盘的时候替我妻子买了100股。我猜测她买的时候股价是108。那天，这只股票特别活跃，收盘的时候上涨了3个点。我妻子对自己的出手不凡感到非常高兴，因此她费了九牛二虎之力，才能够按捺住，不跟我说出这件事情。

无巧不成书，我一直觉得那个时候的市场整体不景气，婆罗洲锡业公司不正常的表现让我有所警惕。我觉得还不是任何股票上涨的时候，于是决定卖空，一次性就卖了1万股婆罗洲锡业公司股票。如果那天我没卖的话，它那天应该能上涨五六个点，而不是3个点。

第二天开盘时，我又卖了2000股，在临收盘的时候，又抛掉了2000股，股价下跌成了102。

又过了一天，哈丁公司棕榈滩经理哈利还在等着我妻子的到来。一般我如果在交易厅内炒股的话，她只能在11点左右才会偷偷去看。

哈利把她拉到一旁说：“利文斯顿夫人，你的那100股要是想保得住的话，就得赶紧再拿钱来。”

“可是我只有那些钱。”她说。

“我可以转到你的常用账户上。”他说。

“不。”她不愿意，“这样的话，我家先生就会知道。”

“可是，你新开的账户已经亏了。”他说。

“但我也确切地对你说过，我不想亏损更多的钱。我连那500美元都不想亏掉。”

“我明白，利文斯顿夫人，但是我不能在没得到你的许可时就卖掉，现在除非你授权我继续持有，不然我就要卖掉它了。”

“我那天买的时候行情不是很好嘛。”她说，“这么快就成这样，简直难以相信。你说呢？”

“对，我也不相信啊。”哈利说。在交易所做事的人必须八面玲珑。

“哈利先生，到底是什么原因啊？”

哈利非常清楚状况，可他说了以后就把我交代出来了，客户们的交易都是非常保密的。所以他只能说：“我也不知道到底是什么情况。哎呀，跌下去了！已经跌到这波低点了！”他指着股市行情牌说。

我的妻子看着下跌的股票行情，大声说：“天哪，哈利先生，我不想损失我那500美元，这可怎么办呢？”

“利文斯顿夫人，如果我是你的话，就去咨询利文斯顿先生。”

“啊，这可不成。他从来不让我炒股，他早就对我讲过，我要是问他，他就会知道情况。我之前可从没偷偷这么做过，我可不敢啊。”

“没关系，”哈利安慰道，“利文斯顿先生是个厉害的投资人，他知道该怎么解决。”她一边听着一边摇头，他又蛊惑道，“不行的话，你再拿出1000美元来挽回你的股票吧。”

遇到这样左右为难的情况，她只能在公司附近徘徊，情况越来越糟糕了，她只得来到我坐着看行情的地方，对我说，她想单独跟我说几句。我们来到私人会话厅，她告诉了我整个事情的来龙去脉。我只能对她说：“你可真笨，再别做这种事情了。”

她说她以后再也不这么干了，我就又给她500美元，她开心地离开了。此时的股价正好是票面价格100美元。

我知道为什么会这样。维森斯坦老奸巨猾，他认为我妻子会把他说的话对我讲，而我就会去研究这只股票。他了解我对这样的事情有多感兴趣，人们都知道我对能赚大钱的交易很在行。我估计他觉得我会买个一两万股的。

这是我经历过的设计最精心最有鼓动性的消息，只是它失灵了，也必然会失灵。首先，我妻子听到这个消息的时候，恰好手里有500美元，所以她具备比以往更大的冒险资本。她想要靠这点儿钱去获利，女人的特质使她不能控制这个小诱惑为她带来的向往情绪。她也清楚我不会同意她这个外行去炒股，所以没对我说。维森斯坦千算万算，只是没算准她的心理。

维森斯坦根本不了解我。我从来不关心内幕消息，我在整个股市都是卖空状态。他觉得那是个诱惑我去买婆罗洲锡业公司股票的好手段，他假传内幕消息，股价也上涨了3个点，他以为我会去买。却不知这正好是我决定放空整个市场时把婆罗洲锡业公司作为起步的原因。

听了妻子的话，我想卖掉那只股票的决心更坚定了。每天早上开盘和下午收盘时，我都会卖掉一些，直到我认定能获得不错的利润时，才会回补空头。

我觉得，靠内幕消息玩股票是非常愚蠢的做法。我认为我骨子里就不喜欢打听内幕消息。我有时觉得那些喜欢内幕消息的人就像喝多了酒一样。有的人架不住消息的传播带给自己的那种快感，总希望处在那种自以为与幸福关联的迷醉状态中。竖起耳朵听内幕消息，是非常容易的事情。在你很容易照办的情况下，让别人告诉你怎么做才能快乐，是世界上第二好的事情，只比快乐本身差一点儿，是实现你心愿很漫长的第一步。这不太像那种眼瞎心急的贪欲，更确切地说是因为懒于动脑而受到了自我限制。

不光是业余的股民们喜欢追寻内幕消息，那些纽交所里非常专业的投机人也在这方面非常投入。我很清楚，其中就有一部分人特别想听我对股市的看法，因为我从来不对人们说所谓的内幕消息。我如果对谁说：“卖掉你手里的5000股钢铁股票吧。”他必定会听从。但是，我如果对他讲，我做的是空头，就算理由非常充分，他也难以听进去，我说完后他还会怒气冲冲，嫌我只说些对行情的看法，而没有直接告诉他一个很明了的消息，耽误了他的时间，根本与华尔街上的大多数人不一样，不是个好心的人。在华尔街，那样的人处处可见，他们喜欢把几百万放到朋友、熟人甚至陌生人的口袋中。

人们都很希望奇迹出现，因为他们对希望抱着特别大的幻想，很大一部分人会不时地陷入希望的巨大泥淖中。我们很清楚，我们看见的那些酒鬼，都是些明显的乐观派，是对内幕消息抱着巨大向往的人。

我认识一个纽交所的经纪人，他觉得我是个很自私冷血的人，因为我从不向别人说一些内幕消息，或者拉朋友一起玩。好多年前的一天，他跟一个记者聊天，那个记者随意说起自己得到了一个值得相信的内幕消息：GOH股票会上涨。于是他马上买了1000股，没想到还没来得及止损就赔了3.5万美元。过了一两天，他又遇到了那个记者，就非常生气。

“太糟糕了，你告诉我的那个消息简直糟透了。”他怨愤地说。

“什么消息啊？”记者问，他居然不记得了。

“就是关于GOH股票的消息啊，你说非常可靠的。”

“我确实说了，是这家公司的一个董事兼财务委员会成员告诉我的。”

“是哪个人？”他问。

“你要是想知道的话，”记者说，“告诉你，是你的老丈人威斯莱克先生。”

“可恶，你为什么不早说呢？”这个经纪人大喊起来，“你害得我赔了3.5万美元。”他不相信他们家族提供的内幕消息，他觉得离这个内幕消息的源头越远，可靠性越高。

老威斯莱克是个成功的银行家，也是个富有的股票商人。有一天，他巧遇了约翰·盖茨，盖茨向他打听内幕消息，老威斯莱克野蛮地说：“你要是听了我的内幕消息后能照办，那我就说；如果不的话，那就别浪费时间了。”

“当然要照办啊。”盖茨笑嘻嘻地打包票。

“把里丁公司的股票卖了。会有25个点的赚头，或许还更多呢。反正至少保证25个点。”威斯莱克确信地说道。

“非常感谢。”这位动不动就要与人赌个100万的盖茨和威斯莱克握手道别，然后朝自己的公司走去。

威斯莱克专门研究过里丁公司的股票，对这个公司非常了解，而且也有内线，所以对他而言，这家股票没有什么秘密，谁都知道他有这么张底牌。此时，他建议这位号称“西部投机人”的盖茨卖掉里丁的股票。

可是，里丁公司的股票在不断上涨，没几周就几乎涨了100个点。一天，老威斯莱克又与盖茨在街上碰面了，他装作没有看到他，赶紧朝前走去。想不到盖茨追上他，春风得意地伸手过来，威斯莱克不知所措地和他握了握。

“很感谢你上次跟我说的关于里丁公司股票的内幕消息。”盖茨说。

“我可没对你说过什么内幕消息。”威斯莱克皱眉说道。

“你说过的。就是你的那条内幕消息让我赚钱了，6万美元啊。”

“赚6万？”

“是啊，你忘了？你让我卖掉里丁公司股票，所以我买进了。威斯莱克啊，我总是把赌注下在你提供的消息的反面上。”盖茨开心地说，“一直是这样。”

威斯莱克瞅着这个得意的西部投机人，嫉妒地说：“盖茨，我如果有你那么明智，就会有很多钱可赚。”

有一天，我遇到著名的漫画家罗杰斯先生。华尔街的经纪人都很喜欢他的那些与华尔街有关的漫画。多年以来，他那些刊登在《先锋报》上的漫画，为无数人带来了乐趣。他告诉我一则故事。在美国和西班牙打仗之前的一天傍晚，他和一个经纪人朋友聊完天分手时，那人从衣帽架上取下自己的礼帽，至少他觉得那是他自己的帽子，因为不光形状相同，而且戴着也合适。

当时，华尔街想的和谈的都是和西班牙作战的话题，能不能打起来呢？如果能打起来，股价必定下跌。不光我们美国人会卖出股票，那些手持美国证券的欧洲人也会抛出更多。如果不打仗，就需要买进股票，因为股市下跌严重，都是那些喜欢煽风点火的报纸引发的。罗杰斯接着说了这个故事的后半部分：

“前一天晚上，我在我那位经纪人朋友的家里度过。第二天，他还站在交易大厅，焦灼地判断到底该买还是该卖。他权衡了做多头还是做空头的种种理由，就是没办法确定哪些消息可靠，哪些消息是谣言。当时，已经没有更加信得过的消息了。他一阵儿觉得战争会打起来，一阵儿又觉得不可能打。可能是因为这样的焦虑心理让他身体发热，他拿下礼帽去擦头上的汗。他没法决定到底是买还是卖。

“恰好他看了一眼礼帽，里面有金色的‘战争’（注：WAR，罗杰斯全名的缩写，正好是战争的英文）字样，这就是他需要的提示。这不就是上帝通过帽子向他传达的指示吗？所以他卖出了大量股票。战争的消息真的传来了，他在下跌的股市中回补，赚了很多钱。”罗杰斯最后说了一句话，“我的那顶帽子一直没要回来。”

但是我知道的有关依靠内幕消息获得利润的故事里，有一个是关于纽交所资深成员胡德的。一天，一个叫波特·沃克的经纪人对胡德说，他因为给南大西洋铁路公司的一个董事帮了个忙，那位董事告诉了他一些内幕消息，让他大量买进南大西洋的股票。该公司的董事们正在想方设法让股票上涨至少25个点，所有董事都没有参与这件事情，但他们大多数都保证会赞成这么做。

波特·沃克确信公司的配股比率会提高。他将消息说给胡德听。他们两人就分别买进了几千股。这只股票在他们买进前和买进后一直不景气，可是胡德却觉得这样的情况显然是要让内线集团有机会吸进股票，而这个集团由感激波特·沃克的朋友负责。

到了下周四，南大西洋铁路公司的董事们在收盘后开会，确定了配股情况。周五早上开盘后这只股票在六分钟里就跌了6个点。

波特·沃克可被气坏了，他去找那个董事，这位董事也非常难过，后悔得不得了。他说他忘了对波特·沃克说过让买进的事情，所以就没告诉他，董事会主要成员们已经改变了计划。这位董事懊悔极了，想急于补偿自己造成的过失，所以又给波特·沃克透露了一个内幕消息。他好心地说，跟他当初的判断相反，他的同事们想廉价买进股票，他只能听他们的意见。现在，他们都买得过多，股价必定会上涨。现在买南大西洋铁路的股票，是恰逢其时。

波特·沃克不光不再怪罪他，还跟这个很有地位的商人热情地握手道别。然后他顺理成章地去找自己的朋友，就是跟着他亏损了的胡德。他们再次准备大捞一把。他们之前就得到消息，说这只股票一定上涨，他们也买进了股票，可是现在这只股票下跌了。情形很明显。因此他们合起来买了5000股。

当他们买进后，股票就暴跌了，明显是内线卖压。这两个内行证实了自己的判断，胡德卖掉了他们合买的5000股。波特·沃克对他说：“如果不是那个该死的浑蛋前天去了佛罗里达，我要打得他满地找牙。是的，我会这么做，你跟我来。”

“去哪儿？”胡德问他。

“去电报局。我要给那个畜生发电报，让他记住一辈子。咱们走吧。”

胡德跟着波特·沃克去了电报局。5000股让他们损失了一大笔。因为气愤难忍，波特·沃克精心写了一份骂人的电报，然后读给胡德听，读完后他说：“我要让他很快知道，我对他的看法到底是怎样的。”

当他正要把电报递给发报员时，胡德说：“算了吧，波特。”

“怎么了？”

“我不想发了。”胡德说得很诚恳。

“这是为什么？”波特·沃克大声问。

“这会把他惹得大发雷霆的。”

“我们不就是想要这样的结果吗？”波特一脸惊讶地看着胡德。

胡德还是摇着头认真地说：“如果你发了电报，我们就再不会得到他的内幕消息了。”

这个故事确实是一个专业的投机人对我讲的。唉，聊那些听从内幕消息的笨蛋有何意义！大家接受内幕消息不是因为他们很愚蠢，而是因为他们喜欢我刚才说的由希望做成的鸡尾酒。罗斯柴尔德男爵致富的方法，远远要比投机来得实惠，有人问他在股市里赚钱是不是特别难，他说正好相反，是很容易的事情。

“那是因为你很富有啊。”提问的人说。

“不是。我找到个简便的办法，然后坚持去实行。我简直是无法控制地在赚钱。如果你想知道，我就告诉你奥秘，就是从不在股市处于低谷时买进，而且卖的时候要快。”

投资人各式各样，很多人喜欢存货清单、盈利统计和各种数字，似乎这些代表了事实和确定不会变动的东西。人为的因素也都被量化。很少数的人喜欢一个人经营。但是我认识的最聪明的投资者，是一个德裔宾夕法尼亚人，他勇闯华尔街，和拉塞尔·塞奇性格很像。

他是一个伟大的调研员，一个不屈不挠的人。他相信自己提出的问题，相信眼见为实，他不愿意用其他人的眼睛看世界。这是很多年前的事情了。他似乎持有不少艾奇逊的股票。不久前，他听到了很多关于该公司和公司高层十分令人不安的消息。他得知，该公司总裁，被传说为商业天才的莱茵哈特先生并不名副其实，反而是个恣意妄为、鲁莽草率的人，搞得公司一团糟。等到无法避免的清算时刻到来时，定会有数不清的麻烦需要应付。

正是这样的新闻，令这个德裔宾夕法尼亚人立刻活跃了起来。他匆匆赶往波士顿，面见莱因哈特先生，当面问了他一些问题。会面过程中，他转述了听到的那些指控，然后问这位艾奇逊—托皮卡—圣塔菲铁路公司的总裁，这些是不是真的。

莱因哈特先生不仅坚决否认了所有指控，还说了很多别的事情：他用数字证明了所有这一切都是恶毒的谎言。德裔宾夕法尼亚人已经询问了有关精确信息的问题，而总裁也回答了他，向他展示了公司的运作状况和财务状况，详细到一美分是怎么流转的。

德裔宾夕法尼亚人谢过莱因哈特先生，回到纽约，迅速将他持有的艾奇逊的股票都卖掉了。一个星期后，他用闲置的资金购买了一大笔特拉华—拉卡瓦纳—西部联合公司的股票。

几年后，我们谈到幸运的换股操作的时候，他谈到自己的这次经历。他解释说到底是什么促成了他如此行事。

他说：“是这样子，我注意到莱因哈特总裁先生，在写下数字的时候，从他的红心桃木办公桌的活动桌板上的文件筐中拿了几页信纸出来。那是一种非常高级的重磅亚麻信纸，纸上印着双色的抬头，十分华丽。这种信纸并不仅仅是非常昂贵，而是昂贵得毫无必要。他在一张纸上写下了几个数字，向我展示公司某些部门到底盈利多少，或是他们如何削减开支，降低成本，然后他把那昂贵的信纸揉成一团，丢进了废纸篓里。不一会儿，他又想让我了解他们正在推行的经营策略，于是又扯了一页漂亮的有双色抬头的信纸，写了几个数字，大功告成后，又丢进了废纸篓里。太多钱就这么不过脑子地浪费掉了。如果总裁如此的话，那他几乎不可能去鼓励甚至奖励勤俭节约的员工。因此，我相信人们跟我讲这位总裁先生是个铺张浪费的人这件事是真的，而没有去听信总裁描绘的图景，于是我卖掉了艾奇逊的股票。

“而几天后，当我走入特拉华—拉卡瓦纳—西部联合公司的时候，事情也是类似的。他们的总裁是老萨姆·斯罗恩，他的办公室就在靠近大门的地方，办公室门大开着，而且一直开着。任何人只要走进公司大门，就可以看到他们的总裁坐在办公桌后；任何人只要走进去，就会立刻和他一起投入生意当中。财经记者对我说，他们和老萨姆·斯罗恩从来都不需要拐弯抹角，从来都是有话直说，斯罗恩也都是正面回答问题，不论其他董事会成员在股票市场有什么危机。

“我去的时候，老先生正在忙着，我起初以为他是在拆信，但是等我走入办公室，走到办公桌跟前，才看清楚他在做什么。后来，我得知这其实是他的日常习惯。在把信件归类拆阅后，他没有把空信封扔掉，而是拿到自己的办公室，闲暇的时候，他把信封拆开，然后用信封的内里空白的一面当作便笺。他把这些纸放在旁边，当需要时便派上用场，就如同莱因哈特先生用他的印刷亚麻信纸一样。空信封、总裁的闲暇时间都没有半点儿浪费。一切资源都被合理利用。

“我心中一动，这家公司能有这样的总裁，那整个公司所有部门都会厉行节约的。总裁会推行这样的作风。当然，我还了解到这家公司生产效益良好。于是我便用所有的流动资金购买了他们的股票。到现在，股票的市值已经翻倍又翻倍，我每年的收入都相当于最初的原始投资的总额。现在我依然还持有特拉华—拉卡瓦纳—西部联合公司的股票，而就在我看到莱因哈特总裁用双色印刷抬头的昂贵亚麻信纸向我举数字证明他一点儿都不浪费然后丢进废纸篓的事情几个月后，那些股票就转到了其他人手中。”

这个故事打动人的地方是它很真实，而且事实也证明，那位德裔宾夕法尼亚人所购买的其他所有股票带来的盈利都比不上特拉华—拉卡瓦纳—西部联合公司。





第十七章


我有一位好朋友，他最喜欢对别人说，他觉得我有种灵验的第六感。他说这个第六感可以在不用分析的情况，就知道该如何去做，我只要随意地听从那些神秘力量的驱使，就能够恰逢其时地从股市中抽身出来。他在早餐桌上最扬扬自得的言论与一只猫有关。他说那只猫告诉我，卖掉手里那些股票。我听了猫传达的消息后，心情沮丧，焦躁不安，直到我卖掉了牛市时期买来的所有股票，才安静了下来。如此，我才能在股价最高的时候卖掉，也就自然而然地证明了那位固执朋友的第六感理论。

我那时候在华盛顿，试图努力说服几个议员，让他们明白对我们大量收税是错误的，当时我并没有在股市上花费多少心力。我突然卖掉了手里的股票，才让朋友那奇怪的说法越发成真了似的。

我承认，确实在某些时候会出现一种难以控制的愿望，想在股市上有所动作。而这与我做多或放空股票没有什么关系。我一定要从市场中跳出来才会感到安心。我个人觉得，这次卖掉手中的股票，是因为我看到了很多警示性的小现象。或许，并没有一个很清晰的能给我一个明确答案的有力的指示信号，刺激我去做突然要做的事情。更可能的是，这就是人们嘴里经常所说的那种“炒股灵感”。老投机分子说，詹姆斯·凯恩和他之前的很多前辈曾经确实把自己身上的那种炒股灵感培养得很出色。我承认，这样的警示最后不但会被证明是非常健全的警告，而且时机能够掌握得一丝不差。不过在刚才这个特例中，没什么第六感存在，也与一只黑猫没什么关系。朋友对谁都说我起床后非常焦躁不安，我想如果我真的坐立不安的话，原因是我很失望。我知道我没有说服与我见面的国会议员，委员会对于课征股市税赋的问题，看法和我不同。我不是要阻止或者逃脱股市上的税收，只是按照一个经验丰富的老炒股手所想的，提出公平又明理的税收方式，我想让政府不要急着杀害在公平层面上能够生出金蛋的鹅。或许是我没有成功劝告他，从而让自己很烦躁，也让我对这个受到不公平税收的业务深感悲观。但是，我会告诉你到底发生了什么事情。

在这一次牛市开始时，我对钢铁和铜的股市行情非常看好，觉得应该做多头。所以我下手积攒股票，一开始买了5000股犹他州铜矿公司的股票，后来又停了下来，感觉股市行情波动不太对。意思是，这只股票变现出来的行情状况，与我对它的感觉不符，买进并不是聪明的做法。我想我是按照114美元的价格买进的。同时，我也按照基本差不多的价格，买了美国钢铁公司的股票，它的情况比较明朗，头天我就按照我以前的那种方式，买了2万股。

钢铁股市持续对路，所以我也一直在买进，直到手里积攒了7.2万股才罢手。但是我手里的犹他州铜矿公司的股票还是一开始买进的那些，一直没有多于5000股。它的行情不好，我没有多买一些的理由。

所有人都很清楚行情，我们处于牛市。我知道股价要上涨，整体来说前景很好。就在股价整体上涨活跃，同时我的账面利润非常可观的时候，行情记录还表现出“还不到时候啊，还不到时候”的状态。我在华盛顿时，行情还是这样的表现。不过，就在那天晚一些的时候，我还能去做多头，可我不想再买进增加头寸了。这期间，股市的前进方向显然跟我的想法一致，我都不必成日坐在行情记录牌跟前，期待着遇到个什么情况然后卖出股票。在退守的号角吹起之前，除非忽然出现所料不及的大事情，不然股市就会停滞不前，或者以其他的方式，让我做好准备，应付突然反转的投机情势。我能轻松愉快地跟议员们讨论事情，就是鉴于这个原因。

同时，股价持续在涨高，这说明多头市场正在走向结束。我不能确定到底什么时候结束，这是我没办法做到的事情。但我不需要对你讲，你就会明白，我一直对此非常留意。无论如何，现在我还是老样子，我做事的习惯已经养成了。

我不能保证，但我非常怀疑，在我抛出所有股票的前一天，还是有些警示的。我看到股市在高位上滞留，于是就考虑到了我手里的股票数量和利润，这确实不是个小数目。后来，我想到我白花了精力去试图影响立法者们，希望他们对华尔街上的股票交易纳税更明智公平一些，可能那时候就这样在我心中埋下了种子。我一晚上都处在这样下意识的状态中。早上，我想起股市，也不清楚它会怎样发展。到了交易大厅，我看到的不是上涨的价格，而是我能得到的不菲的利润和吸收力非常强悍的市场。面对这样的市场，我能够卖掉任意多的股票。当然，一个人手持数量庞大的股票就得随时注意买卖的机会，好把账面上的利润换成正儿八经的现金。在买卖过程中，要尽量不让利润减少。我的经验是，一个人总是不缺乏让利润变现的机会，而且机会总是出现在股市行情走向快要结束的时候。这可不是什么研究行情记录的能力，或者对股市走向的第六感。

那天早上，当市场出现一个让我不费吹灰之力就能卖出股票的时机时，我及时出手了。你在出清持投的时候，卖掉50股和5万股一样需要聪明勇敢，可是在市场不景气的时候，卖掉50股不会致使股价下滑，但卖出5万股就不一样了。我手里有美国钢铁公司的7.2万股，这不算什么大数量的持股，不过也不能卖掉这么多还不会使账面上看起来能获得的那些利润遭受损失，这种损失会与你银行里存着的钱一样，亏损了会让你一样心痛。

我的利润大概有150万美元，股市行情好的时候，我拥有这些利润，可这不能成为我觉得卖掉对了的理由。市场会为我证明对不对，这一点我也确实很满意。是这样的：我把手中美国钢铁公司的7.2万股全部卖掉了，卖出的平均价格恰好比这天股市行情的最高价低了不到1个点。这就说明我做得非常符合时机。但是就在当天的同一小时里，我卖掉5000股犹他州铜矿公司股票时价格跌了5个点。你想啊，我可是同时买进的这两只股票啊。我非常聪明地把美国钢铁公司的股票从2万股增持到了7.2万股，同样我也聪明地没有增持犹他州铜矿的股票。我之前之所以没有卖掉犹他州铜矿的股票，是因为我看好铜矿业，而市场也是多头市场，就算我用它赚不到钱，也不会因为它而赔掉多少。这里面确实没有灵感之说。

股民们在炒股中受到的训练就像医学教育一般。医生们必须要花费很长时间去学习解剖、生理、药物和另外很多的课程。他们学会这些理论后，开始终生行医。他们对各种疾病引发的病情察言观色后进行分类，学会诊断病情。一旦靠着精确的观察诊断对了，接下来就该更好地防治了。不过要牢牢记住，人是没办法不犯错的，同时还会遇到各种突发性事件的影响，使得诊断不可能百分百正确。其后，他们会逐渐积累更丰富的经验，不但知道怎样做正确的事情，而且会在片刻之间这样做，因此很多人认为医生靠直觉行事。而这真的不是反射动作，而是他通过很多年以来对病人情况的熟悉而逐步学会的。而且当病情得以诊断后，他是利用经验告诉他的正确治疗疾病的方法去进行后续工作的。人们能够学习到知识，比如你可以专门用卡片索引来传播你搜集到的知识点，可是经验这种东西就没办法传承。人们可能会明白该干什么，但是如果速度赶不上，还是要赔本的。

一个成功的股票交易者，靠的就是观察、经验、记忆、数学。他既需要准确地观察，也需要牢记自己观察到的结果。他不能在没有依据的事情或者意料之外的情况下去赌。无论他自己多么坚信没有依据的东西，也不管人们对预料之外的情况多么看好，他都要把宝押在可能性上，也就是说他要预测这些可能。在这样的投资游戏里，那些长年累月的行动、连续不断的研究、牢不可破的记忆，能够让人在可以或不能预料的情况发生的时候，都能够及时采取应对措施。

人能够具备很强的数学能力和对事物进行精确观察的能力，可如果他没有多少经验和记忆的储备，仍然会失败。而且，睿智的商人也要像随着科学进展而进步的医生那样，不停地研究整个大势，追踪各种可能对市场走向起到影响作用的发展情况。在这里面打拼几年后，他会养成保持信息灵通的好习惯，他差不多要能够自发地行动起来。他要修炼成珍贵的专业态度，这一点能够让他在行业内不断地成功。专业的炒股手和业余的炒股手，以及偶然玩一次的人之间有很大区别，强调这个差别也不是过分的事。比如我就发现数学和记忆对我帮助很大。数学是华尔街交易商赚钱的基本功，我是说，华尔街就是靠处理数字和事实来赚钱的。

身为交易商，就要时刻保持消息灵通，用纯粹的专业态度来看待整个市场和股市的走向。我只想再次强调：灵感和神秘的看盘能力与最终的成功没有半点儿关系。不过，这样的事情经常出现，经验丰富的交易商反应迅速，以至于没有多余的时间说明所有判断来由，可这些来由是很值得借鉴的，是建立在事实基础上的，而这些事实是他靠着多年的经验，在所有的工作当中，通过观察与思考收集来的，他把每件事情都盘算得清清楚楚。现在，我来说一下，我所指的专业态度是什么意思。

我一直关注着期货市场的动向，这是多年养成的习惯。就像你知道的那样，从政府的各类报道中可以分析出，今年冬小麦的种植量与去年持平，春小麦的种植量比1921年要大。种植情势好很多，我们可能会更早些得到收获。我了解了大致的情形，用数字预算了产量后，马上想到了煤铁工人的罢工。我一直在想着与市场相关的所有因素，所以也就不自觉地想到了这个。我觉得对各地的货物运输已经造成了影响的罢工事件，必定会波及小麦价格。我觉得，罢工引发了交通障碍，冬小麦的运输会被拖延，等到运输状态好点儿以后，春小麦就到了准备运输的时候。这就是说，铁路能够大量运输小麦时，一定会把延后运到市场的冬小麦和提早收成的春小麦一起运来。这意味着小麦会大量进入市场。这是非常明显的事实，那些跟我一样善于观察的交易商肯定不想在这段时间买进小麦。只有当小麦价格跌得差不多，购买能够产生很好的利润，他们才会买。市场没人买，麦价就会跌。这样考虑之后，我必须要搞清自己对不对。就像凯恩说的那句话：“在你赚到钱之前，什么都难说。”市场不景气了，就要及时地卖出，不能浪费时间。

我的经验是，交易商最好的指路牌就是市场的运动方式，正如医生为病人望闻问切一样。

正常的时候，一个人应该能在价格差距在1/4美分的范围内，买卖100万蒲式耳的小麦。那天，我卖了25万蒲式耳小麦去检验市场，了解操作时机，结果价格跌了1/4美分。那时候，这个情况对我来说不够明确，我就又卖了25万蒲式耳。我发现每次都是被人分批少量买走的。这就是说，买盘是由1万或5000蒲式耳的很多单子凑成，而不像以往那样两三笔就买完。除了这样零散的买卖外，由于我的卖出，价格下跌了1又1/4美分。此时我必须要说，市场吸纳小麦与小麦价格下跌是不对等的，这说明市场已没了购买力。这就是真实情况，那怎么办？那就再往外卖。按照经验行事，可能偶尔会让你出错，但不按照经验行事，就是个笨蛋。所以我卖掉了200万蒲式耳小麦，价格下跌更快了。几天后，市场迫使我又卖了200万，价格继续下降。又过了几天，小麦价格开始暴跌，每蒲式耳下跌6美分后还在跌。有时有点儿回稳，可只是一瞬，然后又会下跌。

我在此时没有遵照第六感行事，也没人对我讲什么内幕消息，而是我专业的市场观察力帮我实现了盈利。这也是我多年经商总结的经验。我做的是投资，就要深入研究。行情表明我的想法没错，我需要做的就是加大投入。我就是这么做的，事情也是这么发展的。

在这样的交易里，经验是可以带来稳定效益的，而要得到最好的市场信息就需要观察。你想弄清楚某只股票行情，就要一直观察。然后经验会告诉你，如何从跟平常不同的变化中获利，也就是说从可能性中获利。比如，我们知道股票的波动方式并不单一，可所有股票在多头时上涨，在空头时下跌，这却是很普遍的。这也是自发性的内幕消息里最常见的一个，股票交易所很清楚这点，它向所有不深思这个问题的股民传达这一信息。我的意思是，它总建议股民们买卖同一类股票里低迷的那个。所以，按照逻辑判断，若美国钢铁公司的股票上涨，其他几家钢铁公司也会跟着涨，只是时间先后的问题。交易状况和前景对同类股票中的所有股票都一样，市场带来的好处是惠及所有股票的。按照理论，哪只股票都有情况好的时候，这一点已经被市场验证过了。股民们会买这家没有上涨的钢铁股票，是因为另外两家钢铁股票都已经涨价了。

就算在多头市场，若哪只股票的发展与市场不相符，我就不会买。有时候，我在完全可以肯定的多头市场时买一只股票，可同时看到这类股票的其他股票没有涨高，我就会卖掉这只股票。原因何在？经验告诉我，与那种被我叫作明显类股倾向相违背是不明智的。我不能光靠能确定的东西，也要想到各种可能并且做出预估。有个老前辈曾对我说过：“如果我沿着一条铁轨走路，看见火车以100公里每小时的速度朝我驶来，我还要继续前行吗？朋友，我要躲到一边。我甚至不会因此而夸奖自己。”

去年，在多头市场里，我注意到在某一个类股中，有个股票与同类的其他股票走向不相符，可是这类股票中除了它以外，其他的都跟着整体股市在上涨。我买了很多布莱克·伍德汽车公司的股票。很多人都知道，这个公司发展繁荣，每天的涨幅都在1到3个点，股民们买得越来越多了。这只股票颇受关注，其他汽车公司的股票也跟着上涨。可是，切斯特汽车的股票却很落后，所以没多久人们就议论纷纷。他们拿切斯特的低股价与其他汽车股票的活跃上涨进行比较，也自然会向那些喜欢涉足内幕消息的人或者自以为明智的人打听，然后开始买进切斯特股票，他们觉得它会跟其他汽车股票一样上涨。

股民们买了切斯特的股票，但它并没上涨，而且还下跌了。其实在这样的多头市场中，要拉抬这只股票的价格毫无困难。想想看，在汽车股票中，布莱克·伍德是上涨最厉害的股票之一。而且，我们听到的全是人们对各式汽车需求量增加的消息，全是产量创纪录的新闻。

事情很清楚，切斯特公司内线集团在当时股市上涨时没有做应该做的事情——拉抬股价。这本是正常情况下该做的，没做的原因可能有两个，一个可能是他们想在上涨前多积攒些股票，所以没有力推，可假如你分析一下它的交易量和情势，就会知道这是个很白痴的理由。另一个可能是他们担心拉抬股价会吸进股票。

那些本来需要股票的人却不想要，那我为什么还要呢？我觉得，不管其他汽车公司的股票多么景气，卖掉切斯特总是很必然的事，因为我的经验就是要防范那些跟同类不相符的股票。

我非常容易地证实，切斯特公司没有内部买进，而且相反还有内部的人在卖出。另外也有警告我不要买切斯特股票的其他讯息，不过我只需要知道它与市场不相符的消息，这个是市场行情记录告诉我的，也是我卖掉它的原因。几天后，切斯特股票暴跌。后来我从官方渠道听说，因为公司内部人员知道情况不好，一直在卖股票。跟以往一样，股价下跌后，原因才会人尽皆知。可是，在股价下跌前就有迹象表明了的。我不注重下跌本身，只看各种前期征兆，我不清楚切斯特到底怎么回事，也没跟着感觉走，只是知道其中一定有不对劲的地方。

几天前，我看到报纸说，圭亚那金矿公司股票变动很厉害，在场外按照50美元左右交易，然后在证券交易所挂牌上市。刚刚挂牌时的交易价格大概是35美元，然后就开始下跌，一直下跌到了20美元以下。

我不会认为这样的下跌耸人听闻，因为本就是意料之中的事情，如果有质疑，可以去查看这家公司的发展史，不知道有多少人清楚这件事。人们这么对我说了其中的情形：这家公司组成了一个炒作集团，成员由六个著名的资本家和一家实力派银行共同组成，有个成员是贝尔岛勘探公司的老板，这家公司向圭亚那公司贷了1000多万美元的款，作为交易就得到了四分之一的股份和一些其他合约。这只股票配股后上市，也经过了大力宣传。贝尔岛勘探公司想兑现手中的股票，所以邀请银行家来探讨他们拥有的那四分之一的股份，也就是25万股。银行家采取措施卖出了这些股票，同时还卖了手中的其他股票。他们想委托一个专业人士去做这件事，回报就是把25万股按照比36美元高的价格卖掉后，得到其中三分之一的利润。我清楚，这个协议确定后在签字时，银行家却决定要自己来做，从而节省需要付出的酬劳。所以他们内部指派了个团队。他们要求那25万股按照36美元从贝尔岛勘探公司手中成交，再以41美元上市。也就是说，他们给自己的银行同伙们支付了5美元的利润，然后才开始放入市场去操作。我不知道他们是不是清楚这一点。

对这家银行来说，情形很明显，这次销售作业从各方面看来都是十拿九稳。市场成了多头，圭亚那公司旗下的这类股票在股市上处于前端地位，他们获得了很大的利润，支付了股息。这一情形再加上主办银行的名声很好，股民们觉得圭亚那金矿公司的股票完全适合去投资。我听说大概有40万股涨到了47美元后被出售给大众。

黄金股票的股价上涨形势很不错，可是没多久圭亚那就又下跌了10个点。假若当时公司内部还在继续行销这只股票这也没什么关系。可是，华尔街上不久就收到消息说，情形不是很好，公司的资产不足以支持承销商的高度期望。后来，股价下跌的原因也明了了，可在此之前，我就获得了警示，同时做了应对。这只股票与切斯特汽车股票的情况一样，所以我卖掉了圭亚那公司的股票。价格下跌的时候，我又继续卖，价格愈低。它与切斯特以及我所知的其他十几种有相似情况的股票出现了同样的结果。从行情记录上能明显知悉，公司内部不买股票，他们也明白自己不在多头市场买自家股票的原因。另外来说，不清楚内幕的股民们却在买进，他们觉得这只股票的价格曾上涨到45美元以上，现在按35美元及以下的价格购买就很值，一定会有钱可赚。公司继续配发股利。这只股票现在是便宜货。

接着消息就传出了。像以往重要的市场消息常见的情形类似，当人们知道详情之前，我就已经知道消息了。但是，证实这家公司并没有得到富有的金矿，得到的只是一堆不值钱的乱石的报道，只是让我明白了公司内部为什么很早就卖出股票的原因。我自己不是听到消息才卖出的，在这之前很早我就靠着行情把它卖掉了。我关心的事情与哲学没什么关系，我自己就是个股民，我只寻觅内部买盘的迹象，可这个迹象没出现。我不用知道公司内部在股价下跌时不买的原因，只需要清楚他们的计划中不包含拉高股价就行了。这就能使放空这只股票变得十拿九稳。股民们购买了大概500万股，股票所有权只是让股票从一群期盼止损而卖掉股票的笨蛋手中，转到了一群妄图大赚所以买了股票的笨蛋手中。

我说这些不是对大家买了圭亚那的股票因此赔本和我卖掉这只股票后获利而进行指手画脚，而是想说明对类股进行行情研究是很重要的事情，也想强调大大小小、能力不足的交易者如何忽视这种教训。行情记录的警示不光出现在股市中，在期货市场上也会出现。

在做棉花期货的时候，我经历了一个很有意思的事情。那时候我在股市上做的是空头，在慢慢往外卖，而且赚了钱。同时我也放空了5万包棉花，可是却没怎么重视。后来，我知道棉花期货的首个消息就是赔了25万。我说了，我的股票操作很有意思，而且我的表现也不错，所以我不想分心。关于棉花期货，我是这么想的：“我要等到回调时再平仓。”棉花价格会略微回调，但是在我决定认赔回补的时候，价格反弹了，随后又上涨得更加厉害。所以我就想再等等看吧，又回头操作股票，花心思去交易。最终我结束股票操作，赚了一大笔钱后，就去哈特温泉休假了。

这是我首次真正闲下来，把心思放在处理棉花期货亏损的问题上。这笔交易对我不利，有很多次甚至到了我马上就能赚到钱的程度。我注意到每次有人大量卖出，棉花价格就会适度回调。但是几乎立刻就反弹，并且创下新高价。

我在温泉度假的这几天，已经亏损了100万，棉花价格还在上涨。我细想我做的事情以及我没做的事情，然后对自己说：“我肯定哪里搞错了。”于是，我就立马决定从棉花期货中撤出来。所以我才平了仓，损失大约100万。

第二天，我心无旁骛地打高尔夫球。在棉花期货上我做错了，也付出了代价，这笔代价的收据就在我的衣袋中装着。我当时和此刻一样，对棉花市场毫不关心。吃午饭的时候，我去交易所看了看期货行情，棉花已经下跌了50点，而这并不能说明什么。关键是，我还看到它的价格跟之前几周有些异样，只要那种特意卖出而打压价格的形势稍微减轻些，价格就会反弹，过去这种情形说明最小阻力价格在上升，而我却视而不见，所以赔了100万。

致使我平仓蒙受了很大损失的原因已经不值得一提，因为那种通常意义上的激烈反弹已经不会有了。所以，我卖掉了1万包棉花，然后蛰伏待机。没多长时间，价格就下跌了50点。我又等了等，价格还是没有反弹，我饥饿难耐，只好去餐厅吃饭。点餐后在等服务员上菜的时候，我猛然一惊，赶紧跑回交易所，看到价格还是没有反弹，所以又卖了1万包。过了一会儿，棉花又下跌了40美分，这让我很开心，说明我的做法没错。我又到餐厅吃了午饭，然后回到经纪人办公室。那天，棉花价格一直没有反弹，晚上我就离开了哈特温泉。

打高尔夫球自然让人高兴，但我卖出棉花和回补棉花的举动都是错误的，所以我必须要回到更适合交易的地方开始忙活了。我第一次卖掉棉花，市场反响不错，这就又使我第二次往外抛了1万包，我从市场吸纳棉花的反应中知道，反转已经到来。这一点在不同的市场行为中都表现出来了。

我到华盛顿后，去了我一位老朋友负责的交易公司。到了那里，行情又下跌了。此时我更能确定，之前做得绝对正确。所以，我接着卖掉了4万包，市场价格跌了75点，这说明在这个价位上市场没法支撑得住。那晚到了收盘的时候，价格还是非常低，原本强劲的买盘力量已经消失了。也不知道棉花期货市场会在什么价位才能再次活跃起来，不过我对自己的明智做法信心十足。次日早上，我坐汽车从华盛顿回到了纽约，不用再那么匆匆忙忙了。

到费城时，我开车去了一家交易公司。我了解了棉花期货市场连一点儿支撑力都没有，价格跌得很严重，出现了一种小型恐慌。我也等不及到纽约了，就给经纪人打了个长途电话，让他替我回补空头头寸。当我接到回报单后，看到我其实已经将前一次赔掉的钱补回来了。我继续上路回纽约，再也没半道上停下车去查看行情。

与我一起在哈特温泉度假的朋友们，后来谈到了那天我在准备吃午餐的时候，忽然一惊跑回交易厅去再次卖掉1万包棉花的事情。显然，这不是什么第六感，而是源于对自己判断力的信任所做出的事。我坚信无论之前怎么出错，现在是到了卖出的时候了。我必须要抓住机会，这是我该利用的机会，下意识中的考量一直没停歇，最终有了良好的结果。在华盛顿的抛售，是我对市场考量的结果。这么多年的经验说明，这次最小阻力线的走向已经从上涨变成下跌。

对于在棉花期货中损失100万的事情，我毫无怨言。我没有因为出现了很大失误而自责，也没有因为在费城弥补回来了损失而得意。我的交易心理只关心交易问题，我觉得自己有理由宣称，我有丰富的经验和牢靠的记忆，因此能够补回一开始赔了的资金。





第十八章


华尔街上历史总在重演。你是否记得我曾讲起过的一个故事，说的是当年斯特雷登在抛空玉米的时候，我怎样去回补空头。有一次，我在股市上也用过类似的办法。这只股票是热带贸易公司的股票，不管我卖出还是买进都赚到过钱。热带贸易公司股票的市场交易一直比较活跃，那些喜欢赌一把的股民最喜欢这只股票。报纸一再指责内线集团，说他们比较关心股价的波动，比较不鼓励长期投资这只股票。一天，我认识的一个高水平营业员说，就算丹尼尔·德鲁在伊利公司股票或者哈弗梅尔在美国糖业公司的股票上，都没有热带贸易公司总裁穆里根和他的朋友们在该公司的股票上那样，使用那么完美的办法，赚取了那么多的钱。他们鼓动空头们放空热带贸易股票，再迅速而直接地把他们轧空。空头们在这样的轧空过程中感觉到的恐惧，不比被水压机压迫身体感觉到的恐惧少，他们一点儿都不装模作样。

当然了，也确实有人说过，在热带贸易公司股票的交易过程中，出现过很多名声不好的事情，可我也敢断定，这么说的那些人曾经都有过被轧空的经历。既然场内交易的人经常会被公司内部的人耍弄，那他们为什么还要玩这个游戏呢？嗯，至少有一个原因，那就是他们都喜欢比较活跃的市场。热带贸易公司的股票确实比较活跃，不存在价格持续不变动的情况。不需要打听或者说明原因，没必要浪费时间，也不必紧张，只要耐心等着行情记录中股价的波动。除非空头部位能够厉害到让股票变得很少、很贵，不然总会有大量股票在交易。这是一只随时都可能令人振奋的股票。

这件事发生在不久之前，我那时候与以往一样，在佛罗里达州度假。我在钓鱼，过得非常愉快。除了每过几天会收到一堆报纸外，完全不去考虑与交易市场有关的事。一天早上，是每周送两次邮件的时候，我看了股票价格，发现热带贸易公司股价为155美元。而上次我看到的时候它大概是140美元。我觉得很快就面临空头市场，我在伺机而动，准备卖空股票。可我不必那么忙着去卖，这也是我为什么只钓鱼而不管股市行情的原因。我一旦看到真正的机会，必定会去利用。同时，无论我做事与否，都不会着急地去赶时间。

从我那天上午收到的报纸看，热带贸易公司出现的情况在市场中并不多见，这事让我对股市综合行情的看淡想法变得更加具体了，因为我觉得在股市行情不太好的时候，公司内部的人去拉抬股价，是非常愚笨的做法。有时，公司内部必须要停止从市场中榨取利润。按照股民们的思维，那些不正常的事情，他们都很讨厌。而我觉得，拉抬这只股票的价格，是种错误做法。没有人能犯这么大的错而不用付出代价，在股市中不会的。

看完报纸后，我又去钓鱼，同时我也一直在想热带贸易公司内部有什么打算。我觉得他们必败无疑，这就如同一个人从20层楼上跳下，却没有带着降落伞一样，粉身碎骨是一定的。我没心思去想别的事情，最后只得放弃了钓鱼，向我的一位经纪人发了一封电报，授权他按照市价卖掉2000股的热带贸易。这么做完后，我才安心去钓鱼。我的成绩很不错。

下午的时候，我收到了回复电报。经纪人说，他们按照153美元的股价，替我卖了2000股热带贸易。此时，一切都很顺利。在股市下跌时放空，这是理所当然的。可我再不能继续钓鱼了，离股市价格显示牌太远了。之所以这么觉得，是因为我需要综合考虑所有的因素，来为热带贸易为什么会跟着综合股市一起下跌，却没有因为公司内部的炒作而逆行上涨找原因。所以我从钓鱼场返回棕榈滩，这样就可以直接与纽约通话了。

到了棕榈滩，我发现他们公司的内部人士还在继续做着抬高股价的错事，于是我就放空，又卖了2000股。等拿到单子后，我接着卖了2000股。市场情况也特别好，因为我的卖出，股价在下跌，所有的表现我都很满意，于是出门去欢快一下，可我也并不特别开心，我在想自己为什么没有卖出更多，因此我又返回交易厅，再次卖掉了2000股。

只有往外卖这只股票时，我才能感到舒坦。不久，我就又卖了1万股，然后做出了回纽约的决定。钓鱼暂且搁在一边，我还有其他事情需要处理。

到纽约后，我开始尽力去了解热带贸易公司的详情，包括现状和未来发展。了解得越多，越让我的信念牢固，我确定他们内部的做法不只是莽撞而已，比这样还糟糕，他们竟然在股市和公司盈余都不利于他们的时候操控抬高股价。

这样形成的一点儿涨势既不是时候也不合理，可那些普通的股民，却跟着买进，而这个小表现也鼓舞了公司内部人，他们继续做着愚蠢的举动。所以我放空更多，内线集团停止了拉抬，我按照自己的方式，多次试探，最终一共放空了热带贸易的3万股，此时的股价是133美元。

有人劝我说，热带贸易公司内部清楚每只股票的下落，而且还知道是谁在做着多大的放空部位，以及其他很重要的信息。他们很有能耐，又很精明，反正与他们对着干是非常危险的做法。可事实就是如此，你最可靠得力的战友是股市行情走向。

当然，从153跌至133时，空头部位增加，那些在回调的时候买进的普通股民与以往一样，说当热带贸易高于153时，人们都觉得很值得买进，现在跌了20个点，那就肯定是更值得买了。股票还是那个股票，利率也没变，经营者和业务都是一样的，这可真是来之不易的大便宜啊！

人们的买进，让在外流通的股票供应变少了，公司内部知道有很多的场内营业员卖掉了这只股，觉得轧空的时机到了，于是巧妙地把股价拉抬到150美元。我能肯定，很多人都在回补，可我就是纹丝不动，我为什么要不安呢？内部人或许清楚还有3万股没有回补，可这也没理由让我害怕。我在153美元开始放空，一直到133美元，促使我一路放空的原因还在，而且比之前更加充分。公司内部可能想逼我回补，可他们没有让我看到更加有说服力的因素。股市的基本状况在替我挡箭。要本着耐心和勇气应对并不是难事，投机必须要对自己和自己的判断充满信心。狄克森·华慈，这位已故的纽约棉花交易所前主席、《投机艺术》的知名作者曾经说过：“能够很自信地按照自己的决定展开行动，这就是投机人的勇气。”我不害怕自己会出错，因为除非事实证明我的确错了，不然我不会觉得自己有错。其实，我只有好好使用自己的经验，才能够心安理得。在有段时间，市场不一定会验证出我犯的错，而只有股票涨跌的情况能验证我的部位的对错。我只能够凭借着自己掌握的知识取胜，如果我失败了，也必定是我的错误造成的。

从133涨到150美元的过程中，什么情况都不会吓着我，让我回补。没过多久，这只股票就跟我预估的一样再次下跌了。跌破了140美元后，公司内部才开始应对，散播了很多跟这只股票相关的利多谣言，说这只股票还会上涨，同时他们也在买进。据说这家公司赚了巨额利润，那些利润足够让他们提高固定利率，而且空头部位好像也很大，这场世纪性的轧空马上开始打击普通空头了，放空特别严重的交易人更会受到特别严重的打击。当他们将股价抬高了10个点的时候，我都说不清听到了多少相关的谣言了。

对我个人来说，这场操控没太大的危险，可在股价到149美元的时候，我就确定，华尔街对所有有关那只股票利多的谣言都信以为真了，传播开来，对我来说并不合适。当然，我或者任何其他外人的话，都不值得那些失措的空头去相信，也不会让交易所那些靠听信内幕消息的无知轻信者相信。效果最好的反击手段，只有股市大盘才能讲得出来，而且只有它才能那样讲。谁都相信股市大盘，而不轻信任何喘气的人所说的话，更不会相信我这个卖了3万股的空头说的话。因此，我用上了在斯特雷登轧空玉米时采取的方式，卖掉燕麦，让交易者们看空玉米，这还是我的经验和记忆在发挥作用。

公司内部抬高股价吓唬那些空头时，我并没有用卖出这只股票的方式设法阻止股价上涨。我已经卖了3万股，在外面流通的股数里占比已经很大了，如果再卖就不是明智之举了。他们这么热心地设好圈套，就等着我把头伸进去。股价第二次反弹，的确就是他们多么想让我入套的表现，我不会自讨苦吃。当热带贸易到了149美元时，我要做的是卖出1万左右赤道商业公司的股票。热带贸易公司在这家的持股非常大。

赤道商业公司股票没热带贸易公司那么活跃，果然不出我所料，我抛售后价格大跌，我自然实现了目的。包括交易厅里那些指望热带贸易公司的多头消息能够畅通无阻的人们在内的所有交易分子看到这样的现状，自然就觉得赤道商业在热带贸易上涨的时候下跌，肯定是有问题，绝对的操控炒作，是为了让公司内部的人出售赤道商业公司的股票，而这样大量的操作肯定是赤道商业公司内部人手里的股票在交易，除此之外没有谁会在热带贸易股票涨势正迅猛的时候，卖掉这么多的股票。所以，人们跟着卖出热带贸易股票，这就遏止了它的上涨势头，公司内部根本不会去支撑那么多抢着卖出股票的人们造成的局面，他们没有了支撑，股价立马下跌。股民和一些大型的交易所也卖了一些赤道商业公司的股票，我回补了赤道商业的空头，赚了一点儿小钱。我卖出的时候想的不是赚钱，而是打击热带贸易股票的上涨势头。

热带贸易公司内部和公关人员持续在华尔街上散播各种该股票要上涨的消息，想把股价拉起来。他们一这么做，我就放空赤道商业股票，并且在赤道商业回调、热带贸易股价下跌时，回补赤道商业的空头部位。这样就有力地打击了他们内部集团的操作。热带贸易的股价最终跌到了125美元，放空部位非常大，公司内部能将股价上拉20至25个点，由于空头确实很大，这样的涨势很合理。只是，我预测到了这样的小反弹，但却没去回补，我不想失去自己的头寸。赤道商业配合热带贸易上涨的时候，我又卖出了一大把赤道商业股，取得的效果也与前面一样，让人们看清了热带贸易利多消息的真面目——这只股票经过猛烈上涨后，多头消息又充斥坊间了。

此时，股市大盘回归疲软，正如我之前所讲，我是相信即将要进入熊市了，才在佛罗里达钓鱼的时候就开始往外放空。至于其他股票，我也卖出了不少，不过热带贸易是我的最爱。整体股市在最后变得不堪重负，热带贸易内部也没办法再抵挡，于是股价大跌。这是它多年以来首次跌破120美元，然后又跌到了110美元以下，最后跌破面值，而我还是没有回补。有一天，市场非常疲弱，热带贸易跌破了90美元。我凭借与以往一样的理由，在市场的混乱中回补了。我抓住了机会——市场交易量巨大，行情不好，抛售市场比买进市场大很多。就算被你认为是没意思的自吹自擂，我也要告诉你，我基本上在跌到最低点的时候，回补了我的3万股。只是，我之前没想过要在跌势最低时回补，只是想把账面上的利润套现，在套现过程中不失去太多的利润。

整个过程我都把控得很平稳，我清楚自己的头寸正确。我没有与市场走向相抗衡，没有违背股市基本行情，而是顺应了市场，正因为这个原因，我才非常确定，内线集团一定会溃败。他们想做以前其他人试验过的事情，而这样注定会一败涂地。就算我像其他人那样，知道习惯性的反弹马上要到了，也没有被唬住。我清楚，只要能够忍耐得住，结果必然比想办法去回补，再在价格较高时放空要好很多。我坚守了自认为对的头寸，赚了100多万。之所以有这个结果，并非与第六感有关，也不是因为我有多么厉害的解盘技巧或者愚勇，而是源自我的自信心，我不是靠聪明或虚荣去赚钱的。知识给了我力量，有了力量就不会怕那些谎言，即使它们清晰地出现在报价牌上，也只会昙花一现。

过了一年，热带贸易股票又涨到了150美元，而且盘踞了好几周时间，整体市场也因为持续的涨势大幅回调，这时的市场已经不是多头了。我清楚这点，因为我已经投石问路了。热带贸易公司所属集团的发展情势很不好，我不知道它们怎么才能让股票上涨，就算大盘上涨，也没办法，更何况大盘没一点儿迹象表明要上涨。于是，我就开始抛售热带贸易公司股票，准备放空1万股。我的这个做法，让股价又下跌了。我没发现有任何支撑。然后，买盘的性质突然就发生了变化。

我说自己能够在支撑出现时看出来，不是说自己多么厉害。我忽然觉得，在大盘下跌的时候，公司内部大量买进，里面一定是有原因的。这些人不会感觉到道德上应该具备什么样的义务，来维持住股价。他们不是没用的蠢货，不是慈善家，也不是想拉高股价以便在柜台多卖些股票的承销银行家。我和很多人都放空了，但热带贸易的股价还是在持续上涨。股价在153美元时，我回补了2万股空头；涨到156美元时，我已经翻空为多了。因为，我看到的这个时候的股市行情最小阻力线是上涨的。我不看好整个股市，可这是一只股票的实际交易情势，而不是一般的投机理论。它涨势凶猛，达到了200美元之上，成了这一年最引人关注的股票。广播报纸都报道说，我在被轧空的过程中损失了八九百万美元。但其实，我不但没做空，还已经在做多了。我持股的时间稍微长了些，因此损失了一点儿账面利润。你想不想知道我这么做的缘由？因为我想，如果我是热带贸易公司内部人士的话，我当然会做该做的事情，可这样的事我不去想它，我做的是投机交易，就要照着眼前的事实来做，而不能理所当然地依靠我自以为别人应当做的事情去操作。





第十九章


我不知道是谁何时首次把“炒作”一词跟其实只是普通市场交易的商业过程联系到了一起，来描述在交易所交易大量股票的行为。通过操纵市场低价买进想要的股票也是炒作，但这个不一样，这个不需要你降低标准，用非法的手段去做，不过你也不容易避开去做那些别人认为不正当的事。在多头市场，你如何买到很大数量的同一只股票，而不会对股价造成抬升？这是个问题。而要解决这个问题的话，决定性因素比较多，没办法找到一个通用的办法，除非你笼统地说，要靠聪明的操作。有没有实例？这要根据具体情况来定。此外你再也给不出更加精确的回答。

对于我所从事的事业，每一个阶段我都兴致盎然，我从自己和他人的经验中学到了很多。但是今天下午收盘以后，从那些交易厅里传播的段子中，我很难学到炒股经验。原先大多数巧妙的方式方法都已经跟不上时代，或者成了非法手段。证券交易的法律法规和市场情况都发生了变化。50到70年前，丹尼尔·德鲁、小雅各和古德能做的很多事情，即便很详细、很真实，都已经失去了学习的价值。今天的股民们不用去想以前的股市大咖们做过的那些事情，不用考虑他们为什么那样做，这就等同于西点军校的学生们不用向古代人学习射箭技术，来增加弹道学方面的知识。

此外，对涉及人性的因素展开研究，总是比较好的，比如人为什么容易轻信自己希望的事情？人为什么会允许甚至鼓励自己受到欲望的影响，或者受到他人粗心大意、斤斤计较的影响？恐惧始终与希望对等，所以对投机的人们的心理进行研究，一直都有很大的用处。武器会发生变化，可是战略不会变。不管在纽交所，还是在战场，都是一样的。我觉得最能简单表述这种情形的话就是汤姆斯·伍德罗克说的那句：“假设人们未来继续犯以前出现过的错误是股市投机的基石。”

在市场特别景气时，炒股人员的数量会达到一个峰值。聪明与巧妙是徒劳的，所以在那种时候，花时间去研究如何炒作和投机，没多少道理，就像你想知道同时落在街对面屋檐上的两滴雨的不同点在哪里一样。笨蛋们总是想着不劳而获，所以在牛市的时候，总会吸引一大堆人参与到股市赌博当中，是市场的普遍繁荣刺激了人贪婪的天性。把赚钱的希望寄托在天上掉馅饼上面，迟早都要付出代价的。在我们生活的渺小的地球上，是不存在不劳而获这种东西的。早先，每当我听到人们谈论以前的市场交易和手段时，总认为19世纪60年代和70年代的人，比20世纪初的人更容易受欺骗。可是，我敢确定在当天或者第二天，就会在报纸上看到一种新式骗局，或者交易场所关张的报道，以及笨蛋们的几百万存款在不知不觉中悄然消失的事情。

我刚到纽约的时候，人们喜欢探讨洗盘和对冲单，不过证券交易所已经禁止了这样的做法。有时候洗盘太粗糙，骗不过任何人。谁要是想洗哪只股票，营业员就会立马说，洗得太厉害了。正如我之前所说，市场不止一次出现营业员毫不隐讳地指出交易公司洗盘，也就是一只股票在瞬间就下跌了两三点，目的是在报价牌上落实价格下跌，以便把交易公司里靠一点儿保证金做多的人洗掉。而对冲单的话，用起来总会出错，因为各个经纪商很难操作得非常协调齐整，这都是违反法令的做法。几年前，一个很知名的交易人取消订单后却没取消对冲单中的买单，结果导致一个不知情的营业员在短时间内就将股价炒高了大约25个点，他停下买盘后，就看到这只股票用同样快的速度下跌。这样做是为了制造活跃交易的市场假象，实在是个不好的做法，是种很不正规的手段。对了，就算是遇到最优秀的经纪商，也不要随便透露你的秘密，如果你想让他继续做纽交所的会员，就不能信任他。但是，那些与买空卖空相关联的一切做法，都因为税收而变得比以前昂贵多了。

在字典里，炒作还包含了轧空的意义。嗯，轧空或许本就是炒作出来的，也或许是人们争着买进造成的。比如1901年5月9日，北太平洋铁路公司股票的轧空很明显就不是炒作的结果。斯图兹轧空后，每个相关人都付出了很大的代价，他们的金钱和名誉都受损严重。这一次其实并非特意安排的轧空。

其实，在那些著名的轧空操作中，很少有能够让主导者获利的。范德比准将曾经两次轧空了哈林公司股票，赚了几百万，可是老家伙赚到的钱是来自那些想诈骗他的空头赌手和谎话连篇的议员，那些钱是他应该赚到的。另外，古德在做西北铁路公司的轧空交易时却亏了大钱，怀特在他的拉克万纳轧空时赚到了100万，可詹姆斯·凯恩在汉尼拔—圣乔股票上赔了100万。想要实现轧空赚钱，靠的是用高于成本的价格，卖掉一开始买来的股票，而且要很大规模地操作才能相对容易地实现。

我曾想，为什么在半个世纪之前的那些大作手中间，轧空这么流行。他们的能力都很强，经验也很丰富，而且智慧过人，不会像小孩一样轻信其他作手。但是，他们在轧空中受困的次数却非常多。一个精明的老营业员对我说过，六七十年代的所有大作手都梦想着主动制造一次轧空交易。虚荣心导致了很多次垄断出现，还有些是要报复别人而制造的轧空。总之，有人如果被别人指责说非常成功地实现了一次轧空，其实是说他是个聪明、勇敢并且取得了成就的人。轧空让那些操作者有了高于别人的优势，有同行对他佩服得五体投地也是理所当然的。促使这些人全力去轧空的不是能得到多少财务上的利益，而是虚荣心。

一条狗在咬其他狗的时候，是非常轻松愉悦的。我觉得以前可能说过，我不止一次地想办法从被轧空的危险中逃脱，并非我有多神秘的看盘灵感，而是我大致可以看出，什么时候买盘的性质不能轻率地放空。我靠普通的试探才做到了这点，当年的那些人也必定有这样做的。德鲁曾经好多次都轧空了同时期的其他作手，使得他们因为多次放空伊利股票而连连赔本。而他则在伊利股票上，又吃了范德比准将轧空的亏，他求范德比准将放过他一次，可是范德比准将却毫不心软，他引用德鲁自己曾说过的两句话：“谁把自己本没有的东西卖掉的话，就要重新买回来，或者去蹲监狱。”

华尔街人很少有记得有关一个作手的事情，这位作手在股市上叱咤风云了一代多人，能够让人们牢牢记住，主要是因为他创造了一个名词——灌水股票。

艾迪生·杰罗姆被公认为1863年春公共交易所霸主。有人对我说，他提供的市场内幕消息，简直与银行的现金一样有价值。总之，他确实是个很厉害的作手，赚到过好几百万。他放任不羁，非常奢华，在华尔街上粉丝很多。一直到后来在老南方股票交易时，被号称“沉默的威廉”的亨利·吉普轧空，杰罗姆损失了自己的几百万美元。顺便说一下，吉普是当时州长罗斯维尔·弗劳恩的小舅子。

在过去出现过的大部分轧空中，主要是靠着不让别人知晓你正在轧空这只股票来实现炒作目的，而其他人却不断地受到诱惑放空这只股票。所以，轧空的主要对象集中在那些同时期的专业作手群中，因为普通大众不喜欢做空的人。能够让那些明智的老作手放空的原因与现在让他们放空的原因差不多。我从自己的所见所闻里知道，范德比准将在轧空哈林股票的时候，除了不讲信用的议员们外，其他职业交易者放空，是因为股价太高了。他们觉得股价很高，是因为这只股票价格从来没这么高过。所以，股价高到了令人没办法买进的程度，那卖出就是自然而然的事情了。这是不是听起来很现代化呢？他们想的是价格，而范德比准将想的是价值。鉴于此，很多年后，老前辈们向我提到，当他们想形容贫穷状态的时候，总会说：“他放空了哈林股。”

多年前，我与古德先生的一个老营业员聊天时，他一本正经地向我保证说，古德不但是个异于常人的人，而且绝对比以前和现在的作手们都厉害。老德鲁曾心有余悸地说：“与他交手就意味着死亡。”他指的就是古德。古德必定是个正儿八经的金融牛人，所以才取得了那么大的成就，这是不用怀疑的。即使相隔年代很长，我仍然可以看出他身上有着适应新情况的惊人能力，这在市场交易中是非常难能可贵的。他可以游刃有余地改变攻防方式，他注重的是操纵股票性质，而不是投机本身。他炒作的目的，就是为了投资，而不是改变市场。他在很久之前就明白，要想大赚就要拥有铁路，而不是仅仅在股市中炒作铁路股票。他当然也玩铁路股票，可我猜之所以如此，是因为股市上赚钱最快最轻松，而且他需要大量的钱，正如克里斯·亨廷顿总是嫌钱不够一样。银行能够借给他的资金，总比他所需的钱要少那么两三千万美元。如果光有长远的眼光而缺钱，就只能忧心忡忡；如果有钱了，那么长远的眼光代表的可就是成就、权力和财富，等等等等。

当然，并不是只有当年的这些大咖在炒作，另外一些不太重要的作手也炒作。曾有一位老营业员对我讲过一件与19世纪60年代初的社会情形和道德现象有关的事情。他说：“首次踏进金融区时，我就对华尔街产生了最初的印象。我父亲去那里办事，不知为什么却带着我，我们沿百老汇大街向前走，在华尔街转了弯，然后继续向前，走到宽街还是拿骚街的时候，就到了如今信孚银行大楼这个街口上，我看见有一大堆人跟在两个男人身后。走在前面的男人假装很无所谓的样子朝东走了，后面一个男人满脸通红，一只手用力挥着帽子，另一只手也在空中乱挥，嘴里大嚷着：‘夏洛克，夏洛克（指的是放高利贷的狠心角色）’，金钱的价值到底是什么？夏洛克，夏洛克。我看见人们都从窗户里探头来看。那时候还没有高楼大厦，可我能确定二三楼的人都在张望。我父亲问发生什么事情了，有人说了一通话，我没有听见。我紧紧抓着父亲的手，免得被人群挤开。就像平时常见的那样，街上的人越来越多，我深感不舒服。人们惊愕地从街上走过来，最后我们终于挤出人群。父亲告诉我说，那个大声嚷着‘夏洛克’的人是谁谁谁。我忘了他叫什么，但我记得他是纽约主力股的最大作手。听说除了小雅各以外，他赚过和亏过的钱比谁都多。我之所以知道小雅各，是因为他一个大人叫这么个名字很有意思。被喊作‘夏洛克’的人因为控制着资金而名声很臭，他叫什么我也忘了，只记得他长得又高又瘦，肤色很白。当年，公司内部总是用借钱的方式把资金控制住，或者说让交易所里那些需要钱的人没多少钱可借。他们去借钱，只拿了保付支票，其实并没拿到真正的钱而去其他地方使用。这当然属于操控。我觉得这也是一种炒作方式。”

我非常同意这个老人的观点，这是如今我们并没有的炒作方式。





第二十章


我从来没跟现在还被华尔街津津乐道的那些股市高手说过话，我指的不是领袖，而是大作手。他们都是我炒股的这个时代之前的人。不过，我初次到达纽约时，所有作手中最伟大的人詹姆斯·凯恩正春风得意。可那时我只是个年轻人，只关心怎么样在一家靠谱的股票公司，做出当年在对赌行那样的成就来。而且，凯恩当时正忙于炒作美国钢铁公司的股票，这属于他的炒股杰作。我那时候还没有炒作经验，也没有真正了解炒作的价值与意义，而且对炒作的知识也没什么需求。如果我那时能想到炒作，那也是因为我把炒作看作一种高级的欺骗手段。对赌行用在我身上的那些手段都是低级的骗术。自那时起，我听到的有关炒作的话，都是推测或者质疑，猜的成分要高于理性分析的成分。

与凯恩很熟悉的人对我说过很多次，凯恩是华尔街上自古以来最精明、最有魄力的作手。这一点的意义很重大，因为厉害角色很多，如今都被人们所遗忘，他们叱咤江湖的时候，都是国王一般的显赫，在某一天都是国王。他们依靠报价牌，从毫不知名逐渐成长于金融界，最后创造了名气。可那小小的彩色报价纸牌没有多大的吸引力，不能让他们在那里驻扎多长时间，很难留名后世。反正，凯恩确实成了那代人中最出色的作手，有过很长一段色彩斑斓的岁月。

凯恩运用着他掌握的炒股知识、经验和才干，在哈维梅尔兄弟手下做事。哈维梅尔兄弟想让他为美国糖业公司的股票打造一片市场。当时他不名一文，不然肯定会继续自力更生地操作，他是个非常了不起的大赌徒。在美国糖业公司的股票上，他做得非常成功，他让这只股票成了最受欢迎、最活跃的一只。事情过后，他总被各个公司内部请去操盘。有人对我说，他在这些公司内部炒作时，不会索要或者接收费用，而是总要与公司其他成员那样，得到一份该有的分成。他全权负责股票在市场上的情势，双方总会产生各种叛离和偷跑的传言，他与惠特尼·莱恩集团的争斗，就因为受到了这样的传言攻击。作手想被同伴误解其实很容易，那些同伴不会像他一样，知道自己所需为何。我明白这点是源于自己的经验。

让人惋惜的是，凯恩1901年春完成的最伟大的杰作，即炒作美国钢铁公司的股票，没有确切的记录留给后世。以我的了解，凯恩与摩根先生一直没聊过这事。摩根公司通过塔波特泰勒公司交易，而这家公司则是凯恩的老巢。塔波特泰勒是凯恩的女婿。我敢肯定，凯恩对这家公司的付出，是包括了通过努力获得乐趣的。那年春天，他炒热了市场，也通过交易赚了几百万美元。谁都知道这件事。他对我的一个朋友说过，只短短几周的时间，他通过公开市场，为股票承销公司至少卖出了75万股。如果你了解了下面这两件事情，就会明白这是很厉害的成绩。首先，这是一只没有在市场中历练过的新股票，公司的总资本大过了美国当时的国债总额。其次，也是那个时候，凯恩帮忙打造的另一个市场中，雷德、利兹、穆尔兄弟、亨利·菲利普、弗里克及其他钢铁业的大腕们，也向大众卖掉了几十万股票。

当然，市场走向有利于他，不光当时经济状况是这样，人气和没有受限的资金支援也是他成功的因素。那时候的市场非常好，是一个很大的多头，那样的盛况再出现的概率很小。后来才发生了让人受不了的股市大恐慌。1901年，凯恩炒作抬高的美国钢铁公司普通股是每股55美元，到了1903年股市恐慌的时候，暴跌到了10美元，1904年更是到了8又7/8美元。

我无法具体分析凯恩的所作所为，因为他没写过书，一点儿详细记录都没留下。比如，知道他在联合铜矿公司是怎么样炒作的，肯定会非常精彩。罗杰斯和洛克菲勒曾试图把手中的股票抛出去，结果却遭遇了失败，只好求助凯恩帮忙。凯恩答应了他们的请求。请记住，在罗杰斯的那个时代，他自己本身就是华尔街上一位特别厉害的企业家，洛克菲勒更是标准石油公司里最勇敢的投机人。其实，他们手中拥有的资源非常强大，还有很好的个人名声和很多年驰骋股市的老到经验，但却需要凯恩帮忙。我说这个故事是要告诉你，有的事还非得请专家做才行。这是一只由美国最厉害的几个资本家支撑的备受青睐的股票，却没有很好的卖出市场，如果想要卖出去，就得牺牲很多资金和名声。罗杰斯与洛克菲勒聪明过人，所以觉得只有凯恩才能帮上他们的忙。

凯恩立马投入到了工作当中，他要应对多头市场，按照票面价格卖出22万股联合铜矿的股票。卖掉公司内部的股票后，大众还在继续买，价格也上升了10个点。公司看到股民们这么热衷于这只股票的时候，居然变成了看好卖出的股票。有传言说，罗杰斯还真的向凯恩提出建议，要做多。如果说是罗杰斯想把股票倒给凯恩，那可信度就不高。罗杰斯那么聪明，肯定不会把凯恩当冤大头对待。凯恩按照以往做法，在涨势好的时候，一直压低卖出。当然，他这么做是因为有这样的需求，有受到股市每天的小波动影响。在股市里，跟在战场上一样，要牢牢记住大的谋划和具体的做法之间是有区别的。

有个特别会空手套白狼的人，也是凯恩最信任的人，他前几天对我说，在联合铜矿的那次交易中，如果凯恩有一天发现，自己手中没有一点儿之前为了抬高股价而不得不买回来的股票，第二天他就会买进几千甚至几万股，再过一天，他可能又会卖掉。接着，他不再去理会市场，只让市场自生自灭，同时也给市场一个适应这种状况的机会。他真想彻底卖出手中的股票时，就会像我对你说的那样，一路压低抛售。普通股民们都希望股市会反弹，而且空头也会回补。关于这场炒作，一位和凯恩非常熟悉的人对我提到过，说凯恩帮助罗杰斯和洛克菲勒卖了股票，让他们得到了大概2000万或者2500万现金，罗杰斯送给凯恩一张20万美元的支票。这让人联想到一个百万富翁的妻子，拿出5美分答谢纽约大都会歌剧院的女清洁工，因为女清洁工帮她找到了一串价值10万美元的珍珠项链。凯恩退回了支票，并且顺带递去一张纸条，说自己又不是交易所的营业员，非常高兴能帮上这个小忙。罗杰斯接下了支票，写信说，非常期待能够再次合作。没多久，好心的罗杰斯向凯恩传递了内幕消息，让他在联合铜矿股价到130美元的时候买进。

真是个天才作手啊！好厉害的詹姆斯·凯恩！他的秘书对我说，市场的走向跟他的预期一样时，他会很容易发脾气。知道他的人说，他总是用冷嘲热讽的口气来说话，让人难忘，可以从中看出他的暴躁来。他脾气好的时候是赔了钱后，那时他总表现得像很有教养的上流社会的人，非常和蔼可亲，说话风趣幽默，妙语连珠。

他身上具备了一个成功的炒股专家所必需的那种优良品性，他不论在哪儿炒股都会很成功。很明显，他从不做违逆股市大盘的事情，也从不莽撞行事，他一旦知道自己做错了，会立马摆脱错误轨道。

从他那时候到现在，证券交易的法律法规变化太多，比旧法规也严格了很多，在交易和利润上增加了不少赋税，等等。所以，这个游戏貌似已经发生了变化，凯恩的那些赚钱妙招现在已经过时了。而且，有人对我们很肯定地说，华尔街现在的商业道德已经提高了很多。不过，我可以客观地说，在美国金融发展史上，不管哪个时代，凯恩都会成为一个伟大的作手，因为他是个伟大的炒股手，对投机游戏了解得非常全面透彻。他之所以取得了这样的成果，是因为当时的情况容许他这样做。如果他能在1922年的时候玩股票，一定会取得与1901年时同样的成就，也会跟1876年他初从加州到纽约那样获得成功，那时候他两年就赚了900万美元。有一类人的脚步就是比普通人要快得多，不管跟怎样的普通大众在一个时代，他们天生就是领袖级人物。

其实时代的变化并没有你所想的那么厉害。能够获得的利润确实大不如前，现在已经不是开疆扩土的时代了，也就没有了那些金融前锋获得过的那种利润。可在有些方面，却更适宜炒作了，此外的其他方面都比凯恩那时候难多了。

广告是一门艺术，这是毫无疑问的。把股市大盘当作媒介一样用来炒作，这也是广告艺术。股市行情所呈现的应该是作手们希望大家想看到的情况。故事的真实度越高，说服力也越强，同时广告效果也越好。如今的作手们不但需要让某只股票看起来很有力，而且也要真的让它变得有力。所以，炒作的前提必须是要有健全的交易规则。这是凯恩能成为股市圣手的原因，他自始至终都是最合格的交易者。

“炒作”一词已经成了贬义，它需要被一个其他名称代替。我觉得，假若炒作是为了卖出大把股票的话，那么炒作的过程并没多神妙，也没什么问题。当然，前提是炒作过程中不能混入误导别人的因素。作手们必须要在股民中间寻找买股票的人，这是铁定的。这些买主期望着能赚到大量利润，所以也情愿承担比正常商业风险更大的风险。我不同情那些明明知道这个道理却说自己不能赚到轻松钱是因为别人的原因的人。这样的人在赚钱时好像很聪明，但只要赔了钱就会把别人当坏人和作手。这个时候，炒作从他们的嘴里说出来，就添加了别人在偷偷作弊的暗示，而真实的情形其实不是这样。

一般来说，炒作是为了拓展出市场，也就是说能在任何时候都按照某个价位卖掉手中一大把的股票。有些公司内部如果发现手中的股票因为市场逆转而没办法卖掉，会因此受到很大的损失，他们就会做出雇专家帮忙的决定，他们认为专家的水平和经验有助于他们按照一定的秩序从股市缓缓抽身，而不至于受到很大的损失。

你会发现，我没有说到那些尽力按照最低价买大量股票为目的的炒作，比如以买股票为手段而实现控制股票的行为，因为这样的事情如今已经不常出现了。

古德想着要真正控制西联电报公司，就决定大量买入这只股票，而此时已经好久没有在交易大厅露过面的华盛顿·康纳却忽然出现在了交易所的西联电报股票交易点。他开始买进股票了，大厅里的人们都嘲笑他怎么如此愚蠢地觉得他们很单纯呢，所以都非常得意地把所有的西联电报股票卖给他。他们觉得这是低级的手段，认为康纳在假装古德想让他买进，然后可以拉高股价了。这是炒作？我觉得我可以这样回答：“是，但又不是。”

正如我所说，大多数情况下，炒作是为了按照最高的价格把手中所持股票卖给股民，这不光是个卖出的问题，而且也是分散抛售。不管怎么看，一只股票在1000个人手中，比在一个人手中要好很多，这样有利于市场。所以，作手们需要考虑的不仅是以高价卖出股票，也要考虑股票分散情况。

如果你后续不能诱使股民们从你手中买走股票，那拉抬股价到一个高价位，就没任何道理。当经验不足的作手们准备在头部卖出股票遭遇失败的时候，老手们就会好像很聪明地对你说：“你牵匹马到水边容易，但强迫它喝水就难了。”这人真是好有创意啊。其实，你必须记住炒作的一条规则，这是一条凯恩和其他厉害的老前辈们都很熟悉的规则，那就是要尽力把股票价格炒作到很高的价位，然后再一路压低，分抛给普通的股民。

我还是从头说起吧。假设一个人、一个股票承销商或者一家公司有一大把股票，想按照高价抛出，它在纽交所正常挂牌。股票买卖最理想的地方应该就是公开市场，而最好的购买者应该是普通股民。和卖股票有关的谈判应该由一个人负责，他是公司在位的或者已经退位的董事，他准备在交易所卖出这只股票，但是却没有成功。他已经非常熟悉或者很快就熟悉股市流程了，他清楚必须要有一个经验更丰富、更有水平的人来操作。他听到过或者本来就知道有很多符合标准的人，他打算运用专业手段来操作。他寻找其中一个人，就像生病了去看医生，或者需要工程技术时去找工程师一样。

假设他听说我非常擅长股票交易，那我觉得他就会想方设法地查找与我有关的资料看，接着见我，如果时间合适，他还会到我办公室登门拜访。

我可能对这只股票恰好很了解，知道它的价值所在。对这些很了解本来就是我的分内之事，也是我谋生的手段。来人会对我讲他与他的朋友的需求，进而提出与我合作的希望。

轮到我发言了，我让对方把我觉得必要的能让我知晓这次操作的资料交给我。我判断一下这只股票价格，对它在市场交易中的可能性进行评估，然后结合我对当时股市行情的判断，预估这次操作会不会成功。

我如果通过所有的信息资料得出了令人满意的结果，那我就会答应合作，当时就告诉他我的条件。假如他接受了我提出的条件，包括我需要的酬金，我就可以立即展开操作了。

一般情况下，我需要得到并且也能得到一大笔股票认购权。我绝对需要的是累进认购权，这样对谁都很公平。认购权股价一开始比市场价低一点儿，然后慢慢升高。比如，我获得了10万股的认购权，它的股价目前是40美元，我就一开始用35美元认购几千股，接着是37美元、40美元、45美元、50美元，逐步升高，直到75美元或者80美元。

如果经过我的努力和炒作后，股价上涨了，而且到了最高的价位，人们都很热心购买它，我就可以卖掉一大部分了，我肯定要执行我的认购权。我获得了利润，我的客户也一样赚了钱，这就是理当出现的结果。我拥有的技术如果真是他们用钱所寻找的对象，那他们自然就能获得价值。不过，有时候对方最终也有可能赔钱，不过这样的情况很少，因为我在接这份工作的时候就评估过自己能获得的利润了，不然也不会接手。今年，我接手的那么一两个任务运气不好，没有赚到钱。原因也很多，不过这是另外一回事了，以后有机会我可能会讲。

一只股票要想实现多头走势，首先要做宣传，让人相信正有一个多头走势在伺机而动。是不是听起来很有意思？你再看看，实际上也没那么搞笑，不是吗？其实最有效的宣传，就是你真心实意地去让这只股票活跃起来，变得力道很大。说完该说的，做完该做的以后，全世界最好的公关人员就是股价机器，股市大盘走向就是最好的宣传媒介。我没必要去为客户做任何宣传，不必通过报纸报道股价，不必让财经报道发表对公司未来有多看好，更不需要有粉丝跟在屁股后面。我只需要把这只股票玩得活跃起来，就可以实现我特别想要的结果。股票交易很活跃的时候，就自然会有人想知道原因，当然这一点也说明，那些必要的原因会自己冒出来，出现在媒体上，一点儿都不需要我去协助。

场内股民们需要的只是交易活泛的股票。只要存在自由市场，他们会在任何价位交易股票，看到活跃的交易就会买卖成千上万股，这些分散力量集合起来就很强大了。他们必定就是作手的首批买主。他们一直前行，跟着买卖。所以无论在整个操作的哪个时期，他们都是一股有用的力量。我知道凯恩常会利用最能做事的营业员，既能瞒住他的炒作，同时也因为凯恩知道营业员们是拓展市场和传播消息的好手。他经常按照比行情高的股价，通过口头承诺，把认购权交给营业员，以便他们在能够获利落袋之前帮点儿小忙。他能使他们获得该获得的利益。想让这些行业内的人为我做事，我自己一点儿额外的事情都不必做，只要把一只股票搞得活蹦乱跳就好。营业员没有多少要求。不过，你也要明白，在交易所大厅里买进，是为了卖出赚钱。他们不会坚持等到有很大的利润，但一定要是那种很快就能兑现的利润。

我把一只股票搞活，以吸引股民们的眼球，其中的原因已然讲明。我买卖一只股票，营业员也会跟着交易。既然有这么多股票用于投机，就像我坚持的那样，用认购权把它锁死，就不会有太大的卖出压力。所以，买盘总要比卖盘强，股民们主要不是跟着作手走，而是跟着营业员走，他们会转为买家。我对这样的需求非常满意，可能会抛出股票。如果市场需求是正常的，需要的股票数量就会远远高于我在炒作一开始时被迫买进的数量，如果这样的话，我就会放空。这是技术层面的放空，也就是说，我卖出去的比我的持股还要多。这对我来说是非常安全的，因为我是根据认购权卖出的。当然了，到了股民们没有那么多需求了，股价就不再上涨，我就会停下来等待。

然后，如果这只股票不再上涨，大盘在某一天会因为疲软而回调，或者那些眼光好的营业员能看明白我的这只股票没有人买，他们就会放空这只股票，跟着他们的那些人也会放空。无论什么原因，我的股票价格开始下跌。我就得买进，支撑这只股票，就像一只股票得到自己的公司派欢迎时，应该有的那种支撑一样。而且，我还不用买进股票，就能够支撑住它，也就是说我不用增加持股数量，省得以后还要往出卖。要记住，我如此支撑股价并不会因此损伤财力。自然，我的所作所为实际上是在回补我之前用高价放空的股票。那个时候，我能够在股民们和交易人员的需求前提下，高价放空这些股票。你总该清楚地向人们表明，当这只股票下跌了的时候，总会有人买。如此，一般会制止业内人士莽撞地放空，也会让那些担惊受怕的股东暂缓抛出股票。当股票的走势越来越不好，你一般都会看到这样的卖出压力。一旦没有支撑，股票马上就出现这样的情况。我这样回补，也是我所说的稳定程序中的一个步骤。

市场变好时，我自然会一路前行卖出，可总也不会到阻止股票涨势的程度。我这全是按照稳定计划进行。诚然，在合理有序的股市上涨情形中，卖出的越多，越能鼓励那些保守的投机分子，他们可比鲁莽的营业员数量多得多，股价也迟早会变得疲软，如此情况下，我卖出的越多，对这只股票的支撑就越大。因为我一直在维护放空的部位，所以对自己没有危险，还能支撑股票。一般而言，当我觉得价格到了能赚到利润的时候就卖出。不过，我也常在无利可图的时候卖，因为要为自己的买进创造或者增加买进力量。这就是我说的没有任何风险的买进，我所做的不只是要拉抬股价，或者为客户卖出多少股票，也要为自己牟利。这是我不让客户为我提供操作资金的原因，我的收费取决于我的操作能否成功。

当然，我说的这些并不是我一直在用的手法，我既没有一种一成不变的僵硬系统，也不会按照这种系统去操作。我会因势而动，与时俱进，随时调整。

如果想把一只股票卖出去，就该尽力炒作到最高价后再卖。我重复这一点，一是因为这是最基本的原则，二是因为我非常清楚，人们都相信所有的卖压出现在头部。有的时候，一只股票会停停走走，这样的话，股价是不会上涨的，也就到了卖出的大好时机。你的卖出会让股价下跌，甚至跌到你无法想象的地步，不过你一般也能拉起股价。只要我炒作股票的在我的买单下回升，那我就会很安全，如果有必要，我还可以有充足的信心去勇敢地花自己的钱去买进股票，如同我买进其他类似情形的股票。这是最小阻力线，你记得我曾说过与这个相关的交易见解吗？最小阻力线被确定后，我会按该路线前进，并不是因为我在那个特殊的时刻炒作那只特定的股票，而是因为我自始至终都是那只股票的操作人。

我的买进如果不能拉动股价，我就会停止买进，然后再卖出，即便我恰巧没在炒作它，我也会如此行事。你该清楚，卖掉一只股票的主要手段，是要一路向下卖。在股价下跌时能够卖出那么多，简直让人吃惊。

我再说一遍，在炒作的时候，我从来没有忘掉自己是股票交易人。毕竟我炒作股票的时候，所遇到的问题与操作股票时是一样的。作手如果不能让股票按照自己的意愿波动，就要停止炒作。你在炒作的股票如果没有按照应该出现的情势发展，就该马上出脱，不要跟股市大盘讲道理，也不要想着赚回你的利润，赶快在还能够脱身并且还算廉价脱身的时候就跳出来，为时不晚。





第二十一章


我知道，这些通用的规则是不会让人产生多深刻的印象的，它们就只能这样。如果我举个实实在在的例子，可能会说得更清楚些。我要对你讲，我是怎么通过只买进7000股就将一只股票的价格抬升了30个点的，我创造了一个了不起的市场，它差不多能够容纳任何一只数量庞大的股票。

这只股票名为帝国钢铁，是一群很有声望的人推上市的股票，也做了非常好的宣传，被认定为资产股。华尔街上的几家公司拥有这只股票的百分之三十，用以销售给广大股民。只是它挂牌后，一直交易萎缩，有时候也会有人问到这只股票，就会有一两个股票承销公司的内部人员说，这家公司的盈余比预期要好，前途非常让人兴奋。说得一点儿没错，确实如此，只是没那么让人兴奋，又没有什么亮点诱发投机。从投资角度看，价格是否稳定，能不能持续配股，都没有确定。它就一直没有过引人关注的走向变动，表现太中庸了，即便在公司内部发布了真实报告后，依然没有引起多少上涨，同时，股价也没有多少下跌。

帝国钢铁一直处于这样没名气、没人追捧，也没人传播内幕消息的状态之中，是一只没有人卖出，所以不会下跌的股票。没人卖出，是因为谁都不想放空股权相对集中的股票，因为如果放空就会对空头的地位不利，会受到公司内部操控。同时，也没什么值得买进的理由。所以对投资人而言，帝国钢铁股票是一只投机股。而对投机分子来说，它不冷也不热，你一旦买进做多，它就容易陷入昏睡套牢状态，你的投资思想不支持你这么做。一个人无奈地拖着一具尸体长达一两年，失去的要比尸体的原始成本还高，如果有真正的好东西出现了，他会发现自己被捆绑得不能动弹了。

有一天，帝国钢铁公司的一位重要人士代表他自己和他的同事来找我，表达了想让我为这只股票创造市场的意愿。他们手中有百分之七十的股票都没有卖出。他们希望我能够把那些股票处理给市场，卖出比他们绞尽脑汁在公开市场上售价还高的价位。他们想知道我要接受这个工作的话，需要多少酬金。

我对他说，过几天就让他们知道我的条件。随后我开始分析这只股票，请了一些专业人士去调查这家公司，生产、财务、业务等各个部门都搞清楚。他们给出的报告很中性，而我并非要知道好坏，只是想知道真实的现状罢了。

根据报告，这是一只很有价值的股票，如果投资人愿意等待的话，公司的未来发展会证明，按照现在的市场行情买进这只股是非常划算的。鉴于此，从市场波动上来说，最合理、最容易出现的就是股价上涨。意思是，分析了未来可能出现的情况后得出结论，股价应该会上涨。所以，我找不到不谨慎而有信心地为帝国钢铁公司做一次炒作的理由。

我告诉那个人，让他到我办公室商谈具体事宜。我告诉了他我的条件，我不要现金，只要帝国钢铁10万股的认购权，价格从70到100美元不等。在一些人眼中，这是狮子大开口，可他们应该想到的是，凭他们自己是没办法以70美元卖出10万股的，连5万股都卖不出去。这是一只没市场号召力的股票，一切利于未来的宣传都没吸引到多少人来买。而且，除非他们公司自己先赚到几百万，不然我也不可能拿到我的酬金。我能赚的不是很高的代销费，而是按比较公平的方式，以事情是否成功来决定的酬劳。

我清楚这是一只真正值钱的股票，股市大盘也在看涨，所以对好股票的价格上涨是有利的，我觉得自己可以做好。我提出的想法让客户深受鼓舞，他马上就同意了我的条件，这是个从一开始就令人愉悦的交易。

我尽力从根本上先维护好自己的安全。公司内部控制着百分之七十左右的流通股票，我让他们按照信托合约把这些股票锁定，我不想让大股东们成为股市垃圾场。锁定了这一大半股票后，我还要考虑其余百分之三十散落在市场中的股票，这也是我需要承担的风险。作为一个投机人员，我没想过做无风险的事情。其实所有股票一起进入市场的可能性很小，不会高于人寿保险公司的所有顾客在同一时间死亡的可能性。股市与人命相同，都有一本没有发行的账目。

我先进行了自我保护，免得受到本可避免的风险伤害，然后就行动起来了。我要做的是让我的认购权有价值，想实现目标就要拉抬股价，制造一个我能够卖出我那有认购权的10万股的市场。

我首先要做的是，明确在股价上涨的时候，市场上会进来多少股票。我的经纪商很轻松就搞清楚了这一点，他们一点儿困难都没遇到，就知道了在比现在行情高一点儿的价位上到底有多少股票在等待卖出。我不清楚是不是交易场里的中介专家们告诉他们说，交易场内的账户上有这么多卖单。此时的股价说是70美元，但按照这个价格，我连1000股都卖不出去。我连在这个价格甚至更低点的价格上有一点儿交易需求的证据都没有，我必须要按照经纪商提供的资料数据来开展工作，可这些数据也不能让我确定出想买卖的股票到底有多少。

我拿到这些资料后，就偷偷在70美元和稍微高一点儿的价位上买进了所有出售的股票。你知道的，我说的“我”实际上指的是我的经纪商。那些出售的单子都来自小股民，因为公司在封锁自己的持股前，就取消了所有卖单。

我并不需要买多少股票，而且我清楚适当的上涨会引发其他人购买股票，当然也会出现卖出的情况。

我没有向任何一个人透露帝国钢铁股票上涨的消息，我没必要这么做，我要凭借最好的宣传直接提升人气。我的意思不是说不需要多头宣传。纯新股票的价值，跟宣传羊毛产品、鞋或汽车的价值一样，是很合理也很有必要的。应该让股民们自己谈论精确可靠的消息。不过，我的意思是股市大盘为我做好了这方面的需求准备。我之前提过，信誉度高的报纸媒体总会想办法刊发能够为市场波动提供解释的文章，这就是新闻。读者不光想知道股市上出现了什么，也想知道为什么会出现。所以，作手根本不需要花力气，那些金融记者就会发表能扒拉出来的一切消息或谣言，还会对盈余、产业和发展方向等情况做分析报道，简单讲就是他们会报道出来为股市上涨做解释的新线索。当记者和认识的人向我问起关于这只股票的情况时，我会张口就说出心中的那只股票。我不需要自己提建议，也不透露内幕消息，不过我如果用背后偷着去做的方式来操作，一点儿益处都没有。我也知道，在所有透露内幕消息的人和业务代表里面，股票大盘的走向才最优秀、最具说服力。

我按照70美元和更高一点儿的价格买进了所有出售的股票，消除了市场压力。从交易目的的角度来看，这就表明帝国钢铁股票的最小阻力线显然是朝上走的。交易大厅里那些具备很强观察力的营业员看到其概况，就会很自然地把这只股票看作会上涨的股票，至于幅度他们不会知道，可这已经足够让他们考虑买进了。这只股票很明朗的上涨势头，致使他们对帝国钢铁有了需求，大盘走势提供的是最不会出错的信息。我马上就顺应这样的需求了。我卖掉了那些从疲惫不堪的股东手中买来的股票，他们被套了很久。我自然会万分谨慎、很高兴向市场提供这些需求。我不会向市场大力去销售股票，我不想让上涨势头过于迅速，在刚开始的时候，就把我的10万股卖掉一半一定不是好事。我要做的是搭建一个市场，从而能够销售掉手中的股票。

可是，就算我只卖出了那些营业员想要的股票数量，也还是丢掉了到现在为止还比较稳定的市场买盘。时机到了以后，营业员就不再买进，价格也就会停滞。如果这样，那些沮丧的多头就会抛售，因为没了涨势，就没有了买进的理由，营业员会跟着卖。可我已经准备好了面对这样的卖压。股价跌的时候，我买回之前以高出几美元的价格卖出的股票。我明白这样肯定会让股票不再下跌，也就会阻止股民们卖出。

接着，我从头再做一次。一路向上，把所有要卖的股票都买进，其实没有多少数量，股价也会再次涨高，从比70美元高些的起点开始涨。不要忘记，在股价下跌的时候，许多人都急于卖掉手中的股票，可不想在头部以下三四点的价位往外卖。这样的投机人总向天发誓要在下次反弹的时候再卖掉。在股价上涨的时候，他们开始出售股票，等看到了股价走势发生了变化，又跟着改变初衷。也有些想赚个安稳钱的人会迅速卖掉股票获得利润，在他们眼里，只有落了袋的利润才是真正的利润。

如此反复，我一次次地这样做，来回买卖交易，总是能把股价炒作得更高些。

有的时候，当你买了所有想卖出的股票时，对迅速拉升股价是有好处的，你要炒作的这只股票就会猛涨。这就形成了一个很好的广告契机，因为股票的剧烈涨势本身就成了人们的谈资，就会吸引到专业的玩家和喜欢热闹股票的股民们。我觉得这样的人特别多。我这样操作帝国钢铁股票时，猛烈上涨所带来的购买需求我会全部满足。我的卖单限制了股票上涨的速度和幅度，我持续买进，又持续卖出，不光能抬升股价，还能为帝国钢铁公司的股票拓展出很好的市场。

自从我开始炒作后，这只股票再也没有那种不能自由交易的情况。我的意思是，针对这只股票做很大的交易，都不会使得股价有太厉害的波动。股民们的那种买了以后就会被套牢或者卖出后被轧死的恐惧感不复存在了。因为谁都相信帝国钢铁股票市场会一直活跃，它也就慢慢分售到了专家和普通股民的手里，这与股价的波动让大家产生了炒股信心相关。同时，交易活跃也解决了其他方面的很多困难。最终，经过我买卖了成千上万股后，它的价格成功被拉升到了面值以上。所有人都想按照每股100美元的价格买进帝国钢铁，谁都知道这是一只很好的股票，为什么不买呢？现在跟以前一样便宜，涨势就能说明一切。许多人都觉得，一只股票如果能够从70美元上涨到100美元，那就也有从100美元涨到130美元的可能。

把价格拉升30点的过程中，我只买了7000股。这一批股票，平均持股价格在85美元左右，这就说明我每股赚了15美元。利润还只是在账面上，不过我的所有利润可要大大多于这个，而且非常稳当，因为我已经搭建了一个大市场，足够让我卖出所有的股票了。经过聪明的炒作，这只股票还会上涨，我手里有10万股的认购权，认购价位也在逐渐上涨，从70美元逐步到100美元。

因为后来行情的发展，使得我没有依计而行，把账面利润套现。请允许我自夸一下，我觉得这是一次非常成功的炒作，而且很符合法律法规。成功是行情发展的必然结果。帝国钢铁公司的资产价值很高，股票价位处于高点但也不算贵。原来的承销商里有些成员希望保住这只股的控制权，这是一家实力雄厚的银行。对于银行来说，控制帝国钢铁这样业务好又有发展空间的公司，或许比交给那些散户去控制更好。反正，银行让我把股票的所有认购权都转让出来。这就说明我可以得到一笔很大的利润，所以我马上就同意了。能够卖出这么一笔，从而赚取很多资金，这么做是我非常乐意的。我对自己在这只股票上的所获利润特别满意。

我在转让出那10万股票的认购权之前，获悉那些银行家找了经验丰富的专家评估了这家公司。他们提供的报告为这家银行请我让出认购权提供了理由。我手里仍然有帝国钢铁公司的几千股，我对它信心十足。

在炒作帝国钢铁的股票时，我没有做出任何不正确或者不合适的事。我的买盘如果能使得股价上涨，我就知道不会有什么问题。股票是会出现没法拉抬的情况，可这只股票却从没有萎靡过。当你在买进股票时，它没有什么反应，那就不必考虑获知更好的内幕消息，直接卖出。如果你清楚一只股票的价值很高，市场行情也非常好，你总能在股价下跌后把它再拉升起来，就算跌了20点都可以再拉升。不过，在帝国钢铁股票上，我一直都没必要这么去做。

在炒作股票的时候，我从没有忘掉基本的交易原则。可能你会奇怪，我为什么要反反复复说这一点，或者我为什么要强调不与股市大盘较劲，不因为市场的行为而责怪大盘。你肯定觉得，在事业上赚了好几百万，在华尔街证券交易中操作得很成功的人，必定懂得玩这个游戏的时候要非常冷静，是吧？如果你知道一些非常成功的大公司委派的那些炒作高手常常因为市场的发展走向与他们的预估不相符，从而焦灼得像个小女人的时候，你定会吃惊不小。这样的事情在他们眼里就是个莫大的侮辱，然后他们会因为自己的坏脾气损失掉金钱。

坊间流传着很多我与布兰迪之间关系不好的说法。人们都受到了误导，觉得我俩迟早会因为某个股票上的操作而闹翻，从而产生激烈的矛盾，而操作也会失败，或者会涉及一些诈骗行为，使得我们中的一位付出几百万或者类似的代价。呃，实际上并不是这样的。

布兰迪是我多年的老朋友，为我提供过好多次股市信息，我也因此获利不少。而我也对他提出过很多建议，他或者采纳了，也或者没采纳。如果他采纳了，就会节省一笔钱，因为他是一位推动石油产品公司上市和稀释股权的人。那只股票在成功上市后，综合行情不好，新股的表现没有布兰迪和他的合作伙伴们预料的那么好。情势转好后，布兰迪又召集了一个小组，来操作石油产品公司。

至于他使用的技巧，我不能告诉你。我没有问，他也没告诉我是怎么做的，不过在华尔街上，虽然他的经验很多，人也比较精明，可他做的一切努力都没有丝毫价值。没多久，这个公司就发现，他们在股票出售上丝毫没有办法。他肯定尝试过自己想到的所有办法，因为公司内部的操手们只有在确定自己不能够操作时，才会找外部专业人士帮忙，而这个事情是普通人士不愿意承认的。反正他就来找我了，很客气地说了些见面语后，他提出想让我来把油品公司的股票推出去，这个公司大概有10万多的持股。当时，它的价格在102到103美元。

我觉得这是个稀里糊涂的事情，所以委婉地拒绝了他，不过他还是坚持让我接受这次合作。他从他个人的角度来请我帮忙，我只好同意。我天生就不喜欢去掺和那些我没有把握做成的事情，可同时我觉得人应该对亲戚朋友们承担一些责任。所以我说我会尽力去做，不过同时我也说了，这件事我没有什么必胜的把握，也说了我必定会遇到的困难。可布兰迪却说，他不需要我保证能为公司赚几百万，他对我很有信心，觉得我做就会实现一个让所有理智的人都满意的目标。

是啊，事情就是这样，我答应了一件与我的判断不相符的事情。正如我的担心那样，我发现事情的发展举步维艰，主因还是源于布兰迪炒作这个公司的时候，出过一些错。对我来说，不利因素是时间。我坚信多头涨势很快就要结束，所以市场行情虽然有一点儿改观，布兰迪也受到了些鼓舞，可事实最终必定会证明，这就是个小小的回光返照而已。我怕在自己为油品公司股票做出成绩之前，市场就会变成空头。可我已经许诺过，所以还是要放手一搏。

我开始拉抬股价，但是并不顺畅。我觉得我把股价抬高到107美元左右的时候，就很不错了，我还能卖出一些股票。虽然不多，可让我高兴的是，没加大他们的持股总数。很多公司外的人在等着出现小幅度的上涨，以便卖出手中的股票。在他们看来，我会为他们创造绝佳的机会。如果综合行情好的话，我的表现可能会好一些。他们没早些让我来做，简直是个很糟糕的事情。我认为现在我只能尽力让他们以最小损失卖掉持股。

我把布兰迪叫来，对他讲了我的意思。他一开始不同意，然后我向他解释了我这么做的原因，我说：“布兰迪，我能够清晰地感受到市场脉搏，没人理会你的股票。想知道人们对我的炒作会产生什么反应并不要什么技巧。听着，当你尽力把油品公司的股票包装得吸引人，也准备随时提供所需的支持时，却发现人们不买账，你就能够确定其中存在问题了。不是股票的问题，而是市场的问题。违背股市行情行事不会起什么作用的。如果这么做，一定会赔本。有人跟进了，操盘的人就应该赶紧买回股票，可是如果市场上只有他一个买盘，那他还买的话就太蠢了。我买进5000股的时候，人们也愿意或者有能力跟买5000股，可我确实不想独自来买。我若这样做，就只是积攒了我并不想要的一些做多的股票。此刻能做的只有一件事情，那就是卖，往出卖才是唯一的办法。”

“你的意思是不管多少钱都卖？”布兰迪问。

“是的！”我说。察觉到他想马上反对，我赶紧说，“我如果卖出这只股票，你应该清楚，价格必定跌破面值，而且……”

“不，这可不行！”他大声说道。听他的声音，你一定以为我是在邀请他参加杀人俱乐部。

“布兰迪，”我说，“炒作股票的基本原则是要抬高股价以便卖出。可你在上涨的时候不能大量卖出，你做不到。大量往外卖，要从头部一直下跌的时候开始。我没办法让股价达到125美元或者130美元。我想要这个结果可无能为力。因此，你必须要按照目前的价格卖出。我觉得，所有股票都要跌，油品公司不会逃得过。反正都要下跌，与其等下个月那些股民抛售导致剧烈下跌，还不如现在你们公司自己卖。”

我不觉得我说的话会让人心痛，可是就算你身在万里之外的中国，也会听到他痛苦的喊叫。他一点儿都听不进去我的话。这肯定是不行的，这样会让这只股票留下非常糟糕的记录，更别提它在银行质押贷款可能造成的那些麻烦了。

我继续对他说：“我觉得世界上不存在什么力量能防止油品公司的股票下跌15或者20个点，因为整个股市都要这样下跌。”我接着对他讲，“如果我希望他的股票会是个让人惊讶的例外，那就太荒谬了。”可我说的话一点儿作用都没起到，他一直坚持让我必须要尽力支撑住这只股票。

我眼前的这个人，是个聪明的商人，以前最成功的股票作手之一，在华尔街股市上赚过几百万美元的人，他对炒股游戏的知晓要比普通人深入得多，可是却在空头市场的初期，坚持要支撑一只股票。当然了，股票是他的没错，可做法确实特别不靠谱。总的来说，这是一件不符合规则的事情。我与他据理力争，可是起不了任何作用，他顽固地让我买进以给予支撑。

在股市大盘疲软、股市真正开始了暴跌的时候，油品公司自然不能例外。只是，我不仅没有卖出，还因为布兰迪的坚持，为他们买进了很多股票。

布兰迪这么做的唯一原因是他不相信空头市场已经来临。我坚信多头市场已近尾声，我不光用油品公司测试了市场，也通过买卖其他股票进行了测试，为我起初的猜测给以验证。我不会在完全属于空头市场的时候才去放空股票。至于油品公司，我自然一股都没卖，只放空了其他的股票。

就像我想的那样，油品公司把他们一开始就有的股票和为了拉抬股价却丝毫作用没起而买进的股票全部抱在了怀里，最终的结果还是卖掉了股票，可与布兰迪不让我卖的那个时候相比，他们卖出的价格更低。这不可能有其他结果，可布兰迪还是觉得他们没错，或者他自己没做错。我清楚的是，他说我向他提意见，是因为我放空了其他的股票，可是股市依然是上升趋势。这明显是在说，如果没有进行限价就买完手中的股票，会让油品公司股票暴跌，这样会帮助我在其他股票的空头部位。

这纯粹是信口开河。我不看好股市行情，并非我放空了股票，而是因为我预估股市大盘的发展走向就是这样，我只有在自己从做多转为做空的时候，才会放空。朝着错的方向走，不会有钱可赚，尤其是炒股。我打算卖掉他们的股票，是因为二十年来的经验告诉我，这是最靠谱的操作。布兰迪本应是个很厉害的交易者，能够跟我一样搞明白情势才对。那时候，要做什么事情都为时已晚了。

我觉得布兰迪与大量不懂行的人类似，产生了错觉，认为一位作手什么都可以做到，没什么不可以。作手们可没有这样的本事，没办法做到。凯恩最大的成就是1901年春天炒作美国钢铁公司普通股与特别股。他做到了，不是因为他多么智慧过人或者资金多么庞大，也不是因为他背后有一大堆全美国的牛气富豪为他撑腰。这些都只是片面因素，主要还是因为当时股市大盘和股民们的心理状况都非常适合炒作。

与经验和常识不符的做法不是什么好做法，华尔街的笨蛋们不都是不懂行的人。布兰迪不满意我的做法，我刚刚已经说了。他非常痛心，原因是我违背了自己的意愿而居然按照他的要求炒作了。

只要炒作的过程中不添加肆意歪曲的成分，只是把手里的股票卖掉，就没什么神秘可言，也不会有不公平和欺诈的因子。炒作要健全，必须要有健全的交易原则作支撑。人们都很重视洗盘等这些老式的手段，可我保证，纯粹的技巧并没多大重要性。顾客性质不同，使得炒作股票和在柜台交易股票和证券有一定的差别，并不是因为人们的诉求不一样。摩根公司卖出证券，是卖给投资人，而炒作股票的作手卖出股票，是卖给投机分子。投资人想要的是稳中求胜，为投出的资本找到源源不断的回报，而投机分子要的是迅速获得利润。

股票作手的主要市场目标在投机人群中，投机者们只要机会合适，能够看到大笔好处，就想冒着高于正常状态的险去赚钱。这种盲目的赌法我并不相信，我可能会大笔操作，也可能只操作100股，可不管哪种情形，我都要找到要那么做的充分理由。

我记得很清楚，自己是如何投入到股票炒作——也就是帮别人行销股票——的游戏中的，提起这事我就非常愉悦，因为它能够很巧妙地展现出华尔街上的行家们是怎样看待股市操作的。这事发生在我那次东山再起以后，也就是1915年我交易完伯利恒钢铁股票并且收回资本的时候。

我的交易很稳定，运气也不差。我从来不想着通过报纸露面，不过我也不刻意回避。同时你也清楚，华尔街的专家们总会特意夸大活跃玩家的成败事迹。报纸会根据一点儿内幕消息刊登报道。按照谣言的说法，我都破产过多次了。按照一些很权威的人所传的那样，我也赚过几千万美元，所以对于那些传言，我只能做出一个反应，那就是很难理解它们是怎么来的，为什么会传播开来。我很吃惊的是，谣言怎么会这么猛烈。那些营业员朋友常常会来对我讲同一个故事，每一次都与上一次略有不同，故事在慢慢增加新的内容，然后逐步详尽起来。

我唆了这么多，只是要让你知道，我是怎样开始了帮别人炒作的业务。我偿还了那几百万美元的事情经过报纸报道后，发挥了很大的作用。我每次大量买进或卖出，都会被报纸无限放大，搞得我成了华尔街上的谈资。作手只要炒作20万股就可以完全操纵股市的时期已经不复存在了，可你知道，人们总想着要寻找一个能替代旧时代的新时代标杆。凯恩用高超的技巧博得了股票大作手的名气，依靠自己的本事赚了成千上百万美金，那些银行和承销商邀请他代操股市，帮他们抛售股票。简单地说，华尔街上流传着他过去的成功事迹，所以市场确实也需要他的炒作服务。

可凯恩已经离世了，此后还出现过两三个创造了几个月股市历史的人物，他们因为很久没有动静了，已经销声匿迹。我说的是那几位大手笔玩股票的西部人，他们于1901年来华尔街后，依靠自己拥有的美国钢铁公司股票赚了数千万美元。他们其实是大型股票承销商，不是凯恩那样的大作手。可他们的确很厉害，还很有钱，在推销他们与朋友控股的公司证券方面做出了很大的成绩。他们实际上与凯恩或者弗劳尔州长不一样，并非伟大的作手，可华尔街人还是觉得有一大堆关于他们的事情可谈论。在专业的炒股手和活跃的证券交易商当中，肯定有他们的一批忠实粉丝。他们不再积极交易以后，华尔街上再也找不到值得人们谈论的作手了，起码在报纸上很难出现相关报道了。

你该记得，1915年交易所恢复了业务后，在一段时期内，出现过很大的多头市场。市场规模不断扩大，协约国在美国买了价值数十亿美元的物资，美国从而变得异常繁荣。如论炒作，谁都不必花费多少心力，就能为战争带来的新形势创造出很大的市场。大量的人依靠合约，甚至依靠可以得到合约的口头承诺，就赚了几百万美元。他们靠着乐于帮忙的银行家，或者靠着让自己的公司在没有上市的市场中开展买卖，成了非常成功的股票承销商。任何一个被宣传过的东西，人们都会争相购买。

繁荣的高潮过后，这些承销商觉得自己需要一些股票专业人士来帮忙。当人们对各种证券感兴趣的时候，有的人以较高价格买进。想卖掉没在市场中经历风雨的股票是很难的事情。高潮过后，人们都确证，任何东西的价格都不再上涨了。这并非买的人变明智了，而是那种盲目的购买已经到了尾声，人们的心态变了。市价不用下跌，就让人们都变得很悲观。市场只要沉闷一定的时间后，就会出现这样的情况。

每一次市场繁荣的时候，都有一批公司冒出来，即便它们出现的原因不全是想借助人们强大的购买力赚钱，但至少主要原因是这样。有的人犹豫很久才把股票拿出来承销。承销公司出现这样的失误，原因是他们也只是人而已，不想让繁荣的现实离去。而且，只要潜在利润能大的话，就值得冒险一试。当希望遮挡了视线的时候，你就没办法看清头部。普通人见一只12美元或者14美元没人买的股票一下子涨到了30美元，以为这就是最高点了，可它却又上升到了50美元，这就必定是到了上涨的顶部了，可接着它又涨到60美元、70美元，然后到75美元。这样的局面能够确定了，几周前还是15美元，现在肯定不再涨了。可是，它又涨到了80美元，接着是85美元。此时，大多数普通股民都只想的是价格，而不去思考它应有的价值，同时他们的行动不是由情势主导，而是由恐惧主导，所以他们就采用了最容易的方式，不再觉得涨势会到头。就因为这个原因，不懂行的人可能虽然非常聪明，不在头部买进股票，但是也不获利落袋。市场繁荣景气的时候，人们总是先赚到很多账面上的利润，而最终只能把它们保持在账面上。





第二十二章


一天，我的好朋友，同时也是我的一位主要经纪商吉姆·巴恩斯来找我，他说需要我帮个忙。这样的话要是放在以前，他是从来不会说的。我问他需要帮什么忙，希望我能够帮得上，因为我确实想表达一下我对他的感激之情。他告诉我说，与某只股票有关，事实上他们是这家公司的主要承销商，而且握有很多股票，现在行情变了，他们想把这一大笔股票卖出去。吉姆想让我帮他推广这个联合炉具公司的股票。

因为很多原因，我不想受这件事牵连，可是我受过吉姆的恩惠，他又从个人角度来求我帮忙，仅凭这一点，就足以说服我。我的朋友吉姆是个好人，我想他的公司必定与这件事情关系很深，因此我最终决定要尽力帮他。

我总觉得，战争带来的市场繁荣与其他情况下的市场景气之间有个最明显的区别，那就是青年银行家们在股市中有了自己的新角色。

这一次的股市繁荣属于自发现象，谁都清楚其中的原因，可同时，美国的最大银行与信托机构也在使出吃奶的力气帮各种承销公司和军火商，使他们在很短时间内就摇身一变，成了百万富翁。其中的情形非常可笑，只要某人说他的朋友在联军委员会有朋友，就会得到别人送上的一大笔所需资金，开展还没到手的合约。我曾听人说过一些离谱的事情，小员工成了公司总裁，做了几百万的交易，就是靠着信托公司的信任借到了钱，然后在人们之间转来转去，让谁都受到了合约的恩惠。从欧洲向美国流入了数目巨大的黄金，银行就必须要找到办法来储存这些黄金。

这样做生意，让老前辈们看到肯定会非常不齿，可此时已经很少有老前辈们活跃了。在和平年代，老当益壮的银行总裁恰逢其时，可在这样的非常时期，他们压力很大，年轻才是主要的本钱。很明显，银行获得了非常令人艳羡的利润。

马歇尔国民银行的那位年轻总裁，与吉姆及其合伙人的关系很好，深获信任，他们打算将三家很有名气的炉具公司合并到一起，再把新公司的股票推销出去。过去的好几个月里，只要有股票，不管什么股，人们都想着要买进。

其中有个问题，就是炉具公司业务很好，所以，这三家公司自成立以来，普通股是首次赚到股利。大股东们不想丢掉控制权。在没有上市的市场中，股票行情很好，大股东们愿意放出去的股票都已经被抢购一空，这样的结果令他们非常满意。这三家公司有一些非常小的资本额，没办法让市场出现波动。此时，吉姆的公司进来了，他说只要三家公司合并，那就足以在交易所挂牌了。此后，新股的价值肯定高于旧股。在华尔街，这算是老套路了，让股票换身装扮，就能提高价值。比如当一只股票按照面值很难卖出的时候，只要把它一分为四，就能用30美元或35美元的价格卖掉。这就相当于原来的股票是按照120美元或者140美元的价格卖出。而这样的价位，原来的股票是不可能实现的。

看来吉姆及其合伙人鼓动了一群朋友支持合并计划，他们为了实现投机的目的，持有很多格瑞炉具公司的股票。这家炉具公司很大，因此合并方式是用一股格瑞的旧股票兑换四股联合炉具的新股票。然后，中部炉具与西部炉具也紧随其后，用一股换一股的条件加入了合并计划。他们两家公司在没上市市场上的股价是25到30美元，格瑞比较有名且有股利可分，因此股价大概是125美元。

他们从那些坚持要卖出股票从而套现的股东手里买断了股票，用来筹集资金。同时为了有足够改观业务的额外运营资金和承销费用，他们需要募集几百万美元。所以，吉姆以10万新公司的股票作为质押，去跟心肠不错的马歇尔国民银行总裁借了350万美元。就我知道的情况，公司内部向银行总裁保证过，股价不会低于50美元。这个交易的价值不小，所以里面的利润非常可观。

公司人士行事的第一个错是没有掌握好时机。新股在市场流通中已经饱和，他们应该知道这个，可即使这样，他们若不想像其他公司那样，得到在股市最景气的时候能得到的高额利润，也就能够赚到不小一笔资金了。

你不能轻易说吉姆和合伙人是一群笨蛋或经验欠缺的毛头小子。他们可都是精明的成年人，对华尔街上的一切手段都很清楚，有的人甚至是非常出色的股票交易者。可是他们的所作所为，却不光是高估了股民们的购买力。毕竟，他们在实打实地进行市场测试前，是没办法判断购买力有多少的。他们更严重的错是想着让多头市场持续时间更长一些。我觉得，可能是因为他们曾经都成功地做过交易，尤其是在快速操作而赚钱方面成就突出，从而致使他们对自己能够在多头市场疲软之前就赚到钱充满信心。他们都名气不小，在业内的专业交易者和证券经纪商当中都有粉丝。

这个事例的宣传很到位，报纸确实非常大方，报道了一大篇内容，提到那三家公司是美国炉具产业的范本，产品在世界上都很有名气，合并三家公司，是爱国主义行为。日报上发表了很多报道，说他们在世界范围内是如何开疆拓土的，已经在亚非拉地区的市场中站稳了脚跟。

阅读报纸财经版的读者们都知道，这家公司的董事都是非常著名的人物。公关工作搞得好，公司内部没有署名的人也做了承诺，说股价一定会呈现出什么样的结果，非常肯定且有说服力，所以为新发行的股票搭建了很大的市场需求。最终在申购完了以后，按照50美元公开销售的股票，认购量超出了四分之一。

你想啊，公司使了好几周的劲儿，把股价提升到了75美元以上，平均股价也达到了50美元以上，能够看到的最好结果是按照这样的价位，把所有新股都卖出去。以这个价位释股，说明合并了的几家公司的股票原来的价格大概翻了一番。这是一次危机，他们本该做出应对措施，却纹丝不动。这说明每个行业都有自身的特殊需求，常人的眼光没有专业人士的眼光那么有价值。公司的人因为股票被超额认购而非常高兴，他们很确定地以为，不论它的价格高到多少，发行多少股，人们都会拿着金钱没有节制地买进。他们真是愚蠢至极，竟然没有足额配售准备减持给大众的股票。公司内部决定要贪心时，也应该贪得稍微聪明点儿呀。

全额配售股票，这是他们最该做的事。如此一来，当他们把那些说要公开销售出去的所有股票都卖给股民后，还有四分之一的不足。在必要的时候，这个不足应该能够起到支撑股价的作用，不用公司内部自己出钱。公司内部没有丝毫付出，就能让自己位于非常优势的股市战略地位，这可是我炒作股票的时候，一直想办法找寻的优势。他们本来能够对股价下跌做出防范措施，鼓舞股民们对这只新股充满信心，从而对股票背后的公司坚定信心。公司应该知道在把配售的股票发售给股民们以后，自己的工作并没完，这些都仅仅只是他们必须要做的一部分。

公司自己觉得做得很不错，可没过多长时间，他们所犯的两个巨大错误就导致了严重的后果。人们看到股市出现了回调迹象，就不再去买进这只新发行的股票了。公司内部也跟着担心了，也就没有去支撑联合炉具股票。在股市回调期，如果连自己内部的人都不买进股票的话，那谁还会去买呢！内部人士都不支持，往往就会被看作已经是很清晰的利空信号了。

没必要再说那些详细的统计数字了，联合炉具股票的价格与股市中的其他股票一样，波动起伏着。不过再也没有高过一开始上市时稍高于50美元的价格。吉姆和他的合伙人最终只好买进，以便把股价稳定在40美元以上。在刚刚上市时不支持这只股票，这让人觉得非常遗憾和可惜。可是，没有把股民们认购的股票全部销售出去，这是更加失败的举动。

总而言之，这只新股票在纽交所顺利地挂牌，然后股价也很自然地在下滑，直至以37美元的价格停住才罢。股价能够在这个价格上停止，是因为吉姆及其合伙人必须把股价顶到这个价位上。他们合作的银行质押了10万股，按照每股35美元向他们借了钱，假如银行想要斩断股票收回贷款，那还真难说准股价会跌成什么样子。人们在50美元的时候急着往进买，如今跌成37美元了，反而对它没了任何兴趣，或许就算跌到27美元都还会是无人搭理的状态。

时间长了，人们就开始思索银行大量往外放款的事。青年银行家们的日子临近尾声了，银行业好像面临着重要转折，仿佛在猛然之间，就要回归原来那种谨慎保守的状态。那些本来和银行家非常亲近和友好的人，如今被银行家追着要债，让他无论如何都要还款，好像双方之间以前从来没有一起玩过高尔夫一般。

放款的这边不可能逼迫，贷了款的这一边又不会求着对方宽限些时日。这样的状态，让两边都很为难。就像我的朋友吉姆，与他打交道的银行还是那么友好的样子，可情况已经变成了：“请一定要还清贷款，不然我们都会面临无法想象的后果。”

面临这样的困难局面，以及有可能引发的严重后果，吉姆不得不来找我帮忙，让我代卖10万股，回收资金，还银行那350万美元的贷款。他已经不做通过这些股票赚钱的梦了，只要公司能少亏掉一点儿，他们就谢天谢地了。

这看起来是个没有任何希望的任务。股市大盘没有一点儿活力，后劲不足，偶尔出现个小小反弹，人们都精神一振，打算相信多头市场即将来临，仅此而已。

我对吉姆说需要分析一下后再告诉他，我如果想做这个事情，需要什么条件。我的确分析了一下这个事情，我研究的不是公司的最新年报，而只是想弄清这个问题发生在股市行情中的哪个阶段。我不用公司盈余和未来的理想走向去为这只股票打开市场，抬高价格，而要通过公开市场把这些股票清空。我需要思考的是，仅仅在这个任务当中，哪些因素应该能够或者可能帮到我，哪些因素又会或者可能会对我不利。

比如，我看到少数人手中握着大量的股票，意味着他们控制了过多数量的股票，因此会很不安全，数量多到了足以让人寝食难安的程度。克里夫顿·甘恩公司持股7万，他们公司的业务包括银行投资和经纪行当，也是纽交所会员，还是吉姆的朋友。多年以来，这家公司一直醉心于炉具股票，所以在三家公司的合并事宜上，他们的作用非同小可，他们也诱导了自家客户，使之对这只股票的前景抱了很大幻想。原参议员塞缪尔·戈登也手持7万股，他是他侄子开的一家名为戈登兄弟公司的高级合伙人。还有，名气很大的约书亚·伍尔夫也有6万股。华尔街的这几个老行家一共持有联合炉具公司的20万股，不用哪个好心人士对他们说什么时候应该卖出。如果我有炒作迹象，想吸引人们买进股票，也就是把这只股票弄得比较活跃有力，必然会看到甘恩、戈登和伍尔夫要往外抛出必定不是小数目的股票。一想到他们那20万股会像尼亚加拉大瀑布那样涌入股市，就不会愉快。不要忘记，多头市场的高峰期已经过去了，无论我有多高超的操作技巧，都不可能搭建出非常广阔的市场需求。吉姆有节制地退后，以便把事情交给我来做，而他并没有多少美好的幻想。在多头市场临终的时候，他把这只水分很高的股票交给我去卖。报纸上当然没有关于多头市场临近结束的报道，可我清楚这个局面，吉姆跟我一样清楚，甚至能够肯定，银行也非常清楚。

可我答应了，因此就托人去请甘恩和伍尔夫。那20万股，就像国王请达摩克利斯吃饭时，悬在他头顶的剑一样。我想，要把头发换成一条大铁链，这样才会安全。我觉得，最轻巧的办法就是与他们制定一个共赢合同。如果他们对我稍加配合，在我卖出银行那10万股的时候，他们能够忍住不卖，我就能够帮他们创造出一个大家可以一起出售股票的市场。事情本该如此，就算他们想卖出十分之一的股票，又不想让联合炉具股票下跌，是不可能的事情。他们非常明白，因此也没试图往外卖。我只是希望他们在合适的时候再卖，不要让自私压制了理智。无论是在华尔街还是其他地方，占了有利的位置却无所作为，不会有好果子吃。我准备让他们彻底明白，太早抛售或者不考虑别人就去抛售，是会妨碍出售股票的，时不我待啊。

我希望提出的建议能够说服他们这些经验老到的华尔街大腕，不要在联合炉具股票上抱太大的幻想。甘恩的公司生意非常好，分公司都开到了11个城市，有大量顾客，他还多次做过股票炒作集团的操盘人。

参议员戈登有7万股，是个大富豪。他曾经受到过一个年仅16岁的女美甲师对他背信弃义的控告，所以《都市新闻报》的读者们对他的大名非常熟悉。那个美甲师有一件5000美元的貂皮大衣和戈登写给她的132封信。戈登帮助侄子们创建了公司，他本人也是公司的高级合伙人。他曾经在几十个炒作集团里参与过业务。他以继承的方式掌握了中部炉具公司的一大把股票，其后用它们换了合并的联合炉具公司的10万股。他手中有这么多股票，完全不用管吉姆提供的不靠谱的利好消息，所以他可以在多头市场慢慢消散前就卖出3万股，换回现金。后来，他对朋友说，是其他股东和与他关系很亲近的老朋友们劝他不要再卖出，他才因为顾及情面，没有再出售，要不然他就会卖出更多的股票。此外我刚才也提到过，市场也没有为他的卖出提供机会。

第三个人就是伍尔夫，或许他是三人中间最著名的一个。在过去的20年，谁都清楚他是交易大厅里有名的赌棍。他在拉抬和掼压股价领域鲜有对手，对他而言，两三万股票和两三百股票是没什么不一样的。我在去纽约之前就对他的赌博名声耳熟能详。他那时候还在一个非常喜好赌博又没有限定赌资上限的小公司里做事，那是一家既赌股票又赌马的小集团。

人们都习惯于说他就是个赌徒，除此之外一无是处，可他的能力确实非常强，对待投机游戏也有很值得称赞的态度。而且，据说他对追求知识毫无兴趣，因此也有很多与他相关的奇闻逸事。一个流传最广的笑话说，有一次伍尔夫参加上流社会的宴会，女主人考虑不周全，使得很多宾客都互相谈论起了文学，气氛热烈得连女主人都没办法制止了。

坐在伍尔夫身边的一个女孩不知道他那张嘴巴只会用来吃饭，所以回头与他对话，急切地想知道这个大富豪有什么看法。她问他：“嗯，伍尔夫先生，你怎么看待巴尔扎克？”

伍尔夫非常礼貌，停止了吃东西，然后咽下口中的食物后说：“对于那些没有上市的股票，我是从来不交易的。”

他们就是联合炉具公司的三个最大股东。与他们见面后，我对他们说，假如他们能组成一个小团队，筹集到一笔钱，然后以比市价稍高一点儿的股价，把买进股票的选择权交给我，我就会设法搭建起赚钱的市场。他们马上就问，到底需要多少钱。

我回答说：“你们手里握着联合炉具的股票很长时间了，却没有任何办法。你们合起来有20万股，你们自己非常清楚，你们除了能够搭建一个市场去交易之外，根本没有丝毫的时机卖出。这个市场必须要足够大，才能完全吸纳你们的这笔股票，现金也要足够多，才可以在一开始买进必须要买的股票。如果钱不太够，开始了又停顿不前，是起不了作用的。我建议你们成立联合小团队，筹集600万，再按照40美元的股价，把20万股票的买进选择权授予你们的小团队，同时把你们手中所有股票托管在信托账户。不出问题的话，你们会卖掉手中那些僵死的鸟儿，你们小组也能赚到一笔钱。”

正如我之前所说，坊间流传着我在股市上赚钱的各种谣言。我想这些说我成功了但其实没有成功的流言是有助于我的。总而言之，我不需要向他们多做什么解释。他们非常明白，如果只靠单打独斗，事情不会有什么进展，他们觉得我的想法不错。临走时，他们答应要成立一个小团队。

这三人没怎么耗费精力就成功劝说了很多朋友加入。我想，他们谈论这个小团队的利益时，比我还要确定。我听到的所有消息都说，他们非常确信我的看法，所以他们的内幕消息有一定的依据。总之在几天后，他们就联合成立了一个小团队。甘恩、戈登和伍尔夫按照40美元授予了我20万股票的买进选择权，我为这些股票成立了信托管理。这样，就不会在我拉抬股价的时候，有股票溜进市场中了。这个团队中的人员之间没有多少信任度，很多非常有可能成功的交易，却没有像预料的那样成功，类似的例子很多，所以我要做好自我保护。在华尔街上，狗没有反对咬狗的愚蠢偏见。那时候，第二家美国钢铁线缆公司上市，公司内部互相指责说对方违约，在想办法出售股票。约翰·盖茨与他的朋友，赛里曼斯家族和银行合伙人之间，都曾经有过君子协定。好吧，我在经纪商那里却听到了别人读过下面这首据说是盖茨写的诗：

毒蜘蛛跳上蜈蚣的背，

残忍又幸灾乐祸地发笑，

我要毒死这个害人精，

否则的话它就会反过来毒死我。

请注意，我没有一丁点儿影射华尔街的朋友们曾经在股市上欺骗我的意思，不过出于原则，你还是要为所有突发事件做好准备，这是显而易见的。

甘恩、戈登和伍尔夫对我说了他们已经组团的消息，并说准备筹集600万现金。接下来，我无事可做，就等着这笔款到位。我让他们加快速度，这是非常重要的。不过这笔款项是分阶段到位的，大概通过四五次才完成筹备。我不知道其中的原因，可我有印象的是，我向他们三人发过特别紧急的求救信号。

某天下午，一笔大款项的支票到了我手中，我也就有了大概400万的现金，同时我也接到他们的承诺，说其余款项过上一两天就能到位。如今来看，在多头市场结束前，这个小团队可能会获得一些小成就。不过，就算各方面条件都达到最佳程度，那也不是百分百肯定的，我行动开始得越早越有利。一只本来不受待见的股票，忽然出现了一些新动向，股民们是不会有多大兴趣的。不过当你手中有了400万美金后，能够做的事情就会更多，完全可以使人们对这只股票产生兴趣。这笔款完全能够吸进一切有卖出可能性的股票。时机如果真的跟我说的一样迫在眉睫，我也就不需要等还没到位的那200万了，我越能够趁早把股价抬高到50美元，对这个小团队来说也越有利，这是显而易见的。

第二天一早，股市开盘后，我惊奇地发现，联合炉具公司股票出现了大量的交易，这是非常难得一见的现象。正如我刚刚所说，好几个月来，它一直处于萎靡不振、一步都迈不动的状态，股价也一直在37美元左右停滞。吉姆使出了吃奶的劲儿，试图让它不要再下跌不止。他按照每股35美元向银行质押，贷回来一笔巨款。提到上涨，他是想看到联合炉具股票价格上涨，可是这却比看到直布罗陀海峡的礁石在海面上漂移还要困难。

伙计啊，这只股票在那天早上表现出的需求量真是大，股价涨到了39美元。在第一个小时的交易段内，交易量就超过了以往半年的成交总量。当天，这只股票成了最热门的股票，同时整个股市都受到了它的影响，有了一点儿多头市场的气色。后来，我听说人们在交易大厅内都不谈论其他事情，只讨论与这只股票有关的话题。

我不清楚这是什么意思，可看到联合炉具股票活了过来，我就觉得在感情上没有受到打击。通常而言，我没必要去打听很难见到的股票波动的消息，我那些交易大厅里帮我做交易的朋友和其他好朋友都会向我传达消息。他们觉得我肯定想知道，所以会把他们听到的所有消息和谣言都通过电话告诉我。

我在这天听到了联合炉具公司确实有内部人在买进股票的消息，没有任何洗盘动作，所有的交易都是正儿八经的买进。买股票的人在股价到37至39美元的时候，把所有卖出的股票都尽收囊中，人们请他给个这么做的理由，哪怕提供一点儿内幕消息也行，可是却没有得到答复。这个现象，使得那些紧盯着市场的聪明的交易人员觉得，一定有什么内幕在酝酿，会有很大的行情变动。公司内部的人买进自家股票，使得股价上涨，而他们又不鼓励其他股民跟进，这就让那些执着的股民开始到处搜索消息，打听到底什么时候会有正式的变动通知。

我个人什么都没干，只是认真观察，甚觉奇怪。我也追踪着这只股票的交易走势。第二天，人们买进这只股票的数量越发多了，而且更加猛烈。按照业内账册的记录，之前几个月里37美元以上想卖却没卖出的股票，此时非常轻松地就被市场吸纳了，而且又没有更多的新卖单拉住上涨的势头。股价一如既往地上升，超过40美元，然后又涨到了42美元。

此时，我认为应该把银行质押的那些股票抛出了。我自然不会觉得，我卖出这么多股票会拉低股价，而只要我整体持股的平均成本在37美元，就没人指摘我。我清楚这只股票的价值，通过对它在几个月里被冷落的状态进行观察后，我或多或少了解了这只股票的市场情况。我谨慎地把股票卖向市场，最后卖出了3万股，真的没有拉低涨势。

那天下午，有人对我讲了出现这种及时又神奇的涨势的原因。好像在前一天收盘后到这一天开盘前的这段时间，有人向营业员透露消息，说我如烈火般凶猛地看好联合炉具公司，还打算按照以往惯例，把股价抬高15到20个点，中途不会停歇。所谓我的惯例，其实是那些从不会去研究我记录的人的片面看法。负责传播内幕消息的人是伍尔夫，真是来头好大呀。正是因为他自己的内线买进了股票，使得股价从前一天开始上涨。他那些营业员群体中的好朋友非常高兴跟着他的消息走，他了解的内幕真的很多，不会对跟随自己的粉丝们提供假消息。

其实，进入市场的股票比我原来担心的要少一些。你要是记得我已经控制住了30万股，就明白我起先的那些担心并非多余，现在要拉升股价变得轻松多了。弗劳尔州长说得对——每天都会有人骂他炒作自己公司负责的如芝加哥瓦斯和联邦钢铁等股票——他说：“我知道只有买进才是让股价上涨的唯一办法。”这也是营业员们抬升股价的唯一方法。价格会反映买盘，跟着上涨。

第二天早餐前，我在报纸上看到了一条消息，这是好多人都能看到的，没什么可怀疑的，这条消息会通过电报送达几百家股票分公司和外地的股票交易公司。报道说，拉里·利文斯顿马上会下大功夫做多联合炉具股票。各个报纸的报道中涉及的细节性内容大同小异，有一家说我组织了一个内部机构，准备向那些过度放空的空头进行大反击。还有一家报道说，公司在不久后就要发布配股消息。另有报道也在提醒人们，要注意我在操作那些吃香的股票时取得的成就，但同时也有报道说这个公司为了让内部人士吃饱股票，从而隐藏了资产。一切新闻报道都觉得这只股票的涨势才刚刚开始。

那天早上，在开盘之前，我还没到办公室看我的信件，就已经得知华尔街上充斥着刚出炉的内幕消息，让大家赶紧买联合炉具的股票。我的电话响了一上午，电话员接到了上百个电话，问的都是同一个问题：联合炉具的股价到底会不会上涨。我必须承认，伍尔夫、甘恩和戈登，或许还有吉姆，他们把透露内幕消息这样的事情做得天衣无缝。

我真不知道追随我的人这么多。哈，一早上收到了大量来自全国各地的买单，都买的是几千股，这只股票在三天前可是多低价位都没人搭理呀。你不要忘记，其实股民们完全是靠着报纸知道了我是个非常成功的大赌徒，这可得感谢那些极富想象力的记者。

伙计们，情况发展成这样，股价上涨第三天的时候，我卖出了联合炉具的股票，紧接着连卖了三天，然后才察觉我已经把吉姆质押给马歇尔国民银行的10万股抛售空了，这可是350万美元的质押股呀。如果说，一个作手花最低的成本实现了最终目标属于最成功的炒作，那么这次有关联合炉具的炒作肯定是我在华尔街的奋斗历程中最出色的成绩。啊，我连任何股票都没有买进，我都没有为了后来能够卖出得轻松些而先买进。我也没有把股票抬升到最高点再正儿八经地卖出。我甚至不必在价格一路走低时把卖出作为主要的行动，反而是在价格抬升时卖出的。这简直就如同在游乐场里做了个美梦，没有耗费多少精力，就挖掘出了别人为你搭建的庞大的买方市场。特别是在你急着想抛售的时候。以前，我听弗劳尔州长的朋友说过，有一次，这位伟大的多头领袖为一家公司炒作的时候，这家公司获利卖出了5万股，可是弗劳尔团队却赚了超过25万股的交易手续费。汉密尔顿提到过，詹姆斯·凯恩为了售出联合铜矿公司的22万股，通过必要的炒作过程，最少需要做70万股的交易。这样的手续费成本太高了。对照这些情况，再看看我付出的手续费，只有我为吉姆卖出10万股的那点儿费用，我觉得这是个非常了不起的事情。

虽然他们同意筹集的600万资金没有完全到位，可我向好友吉姆做出的承诺已经实现，我也不想把之前自己卖出的任何股票再买进来，反而只想好好找个地方去度个短假。我的记忆已经模糊了，可我清楚记得的是我让这只股票顺其自然地去发展，不久后它就价格下跌了。某一天，整个股市都很疲软，一个做多头的人很失望，他想迅速卖掉手里的联合炉具股票。由于他引发的卖压，使得股价跌破了40美元，到了我买进选择权的价位以下。好像没人再想要这只股票了。我原来说过，自己并不怎么太看好股市，所以我很感激出现了那一点儿奇迹，使我能够卖掉10万股，而且还没有出现与传达消息的大善人所预想的情形，即在一周内将股价拉升二三十美元。这只股票在没有支撑的情况下，价格一直下跌。有一天跌得非常严重，到了有史以来的最低价位32美元。估计你还记得，吉姆和他的伙伴们把持的股价是37美元，以防银行拿他们的10万股去市场釜底抽薪。

那天，我安静地坐在办公室里研究股市行情，有人说伍尔夫来了。我请他进来后，一眼就看到他直冲我过来，不太高大的身躯被怒气包裹着，好像发胖了一般。

他走到我跟前，大声说道：“哎，这算怎么回事？”

“伍尔夫先生，请坐吧。”我客气地说完后坐了下来，好让他能够平静下来。

“我不坐，我只想知道是怎么回事？”他把嗓门提到了最高。

“什么怎么回事？”

“你到底把它怎么了？”

“我把什么怎么了呀？”

“就是股票，那只股票！”

“哪只股票？”我问道。

我这样一无所知的样子更加使他生气了，他继续吼着：“联合炉具。你把它怎么了？”

“没怎么呀，我肯定什么都没做，出什么问题了？”我问。

他直勾勾地瞪了我足足五秒钟，然后大叫：“你瞧瞧股价！瞧瞧！”他真的特别气愤。

我站起来看了看股价，然后说：“现在股价是31又1/4美元。”

“没错！31又1/4美元，而我手里有一大把。”

“你有6万股，我清楚。这笔股票在你手中时间不短了，因为你当时买进格瑞炉具的时候……”

他不等我说下去就打断了我的话，他说：“但是我后来又买了很多，有的是按照40美元高价买的，现在还在我手里！”

他怒火中烧地看着我，我说：“我又没让你买。”

“什么？”

“我没让你买那么多。”

“我的意思不是说你让我买的，可是你准备要拉抬股价……”

“我为什么要这样做？”我打断了他的话。

他气得一言不发，直盯着我，半天才开口说：“原来你是要抬高股价的，你有钱买。”

“没错啊，可是我没有买。”我对他说。这像是我最后亮出的撒手锏。

“你没买？你拿着400多万美金可以用，但是你没有买？”

“连一股都没买。”我重复道。

此时，他已经气得说不出话来了，良久才说道：“你这玩的是什么把戏？”

还不知他心里面怎么恶毒地骂我呢。从他的眼神中，我看到了他给我定的一连串罪责。我对他说：“伍尔夫，你想问的是，我为什么没用50美元以上的价格买你手里那些40美元以下买进的股票吧？”

“不，不是。你有40美元吸进的选择权，而且又有400万现金可以用来抬高股价。”

“没错，可是我并没有用这些钱，而且我也没有让这个团队赔一美元。”

“你听我说，利文斯顿……”他说。

不过我堵住了他要说的话。

“你听我说，伍尔夫。我清楚你和戈登、甘恩一共有20万股套在里面了，而且知道我如果拉抬股价的话，肯定没多少股票冲进股市，但我必须要这么做，因为一方面得为这只股票搭建出市场来，其次要利用40美元的选择权赚钱。可你要么是因为对自己手里拿了好几个月的6万股只卖到40美元非常不满意，要么是因为对小团队分给你的利润不满意，因此你在40美元以下的时候买进了很多股票，想在我用团队的那笔钱拉抬的时候再倒给我，你认定了我会这样。你想在我买之前自己先买进，而且在我卖出之前自己先卖出，总之你把我当作你倒卖股票的对象。我想你肯定觉得我能把股价拉抬到60美元。事情很清晰，你可能买进了1万股，就是为了再倒出。我如果不背黑锅的话，你为了确保有人背黑锅，就向美国、加拿大和墨西哥的所有股民透露内幕消息，根本不考虑为我增加了多少困难。你所有的朋友都知道我该怎么做，在我和他们买进的时候，你幸灾乐祸。哼，你把内幕透露给朋友，他们买进股票的时候，再把消息一传十、十传百地传播给更多的笨蛋，这么一来，等我最终要卖的时候，会发现自己面对的是好几千个聪明的投机分子。伍尔夫，这可真是个好心的主意啊。在我还没想到要买的时候，联合炉具就开涨了，你知道我有多吃惊，我有多感激，竟然以40美元的价位替大家把10万股卖给了那些想着等涨到五六十美元再倒卖出去的人。我没用那400万为团队谋利润，特别傻吧？那是我可以用到股票买进上的钱，可我要在自认为该买的时候买。嗯，而我觉得没必要去买进。”

伍尔夫在华尔街上混了好多年，不会让愤怒的情绪妨碍正事。在我说话的时候，他逐渐心平气和了。等我说完，他就比较友好地说：“你听我说，拉里，我的朋友，那我们该怎么办呢？”

“你们爱怎么办就怎么办。”

“呵呵，拿出点儿风度啊。你如果是我，你会怎么办？”

“我如果是你，”我认真地说道，“你想知道吗？”

“怎么办？”

“我会全部卖掉！”我回答道。

他盯着我好一会儿，一句话也没说，转身离开了办公室，这之后没再来过。

事后不久，参议员戈登也来找过我，抱怨是我让他们身处困境。最后，甘恩也跟着起哄。他们忘了在组建团队时，他们手中的股票一点儿都没法大把卖出去。他们只记得我手里握着几百万现金，而在市场比较活泛，股价涨到44美元的时候，没有为他们卖出。此时股价下跌到了30美元，像一潭绝望的死水。在他们看来，我就该为他们卖出股票，该为他们赚很多的钱。

过了一段时间，他们都逐渐心平气和了。这个小团队没有赔钱，仍然面临着需要卖掉大量股票的问题。过了一两天，他们找我帮他们解决困难，戈登尤其坚持。最后，我让他们把共同的股票锁在25又1/2美元上。我为他们效劳，酬金是按照这个价格卖出股票后一半的利润。这只股票最终报价在30美元左右，我又要为他们卖出股票了。在考虑整体股市行情，特别是联合炉具股票情况的前提下，只有一个办法能够卖出它，那就是一路往下卖，而且不能提前去做拉抬股价的事。我敢肯定，如果想着为了卖个比较好的价格而一路抬高，那肯定能收到很多股票，可是如果压低了价格卖，我可以找到人买。他们总觉得，只要在高点上下跌了15或20个点，就变得很便宜了，特别是从近期出现的高点上下跌，他们就会认为股价马上就要反弹。之前联合炉具涨到了44美元，如今跌到30美元以下了，就觉得必定是非常便宜的好股票。

这样卖，就与原先一样，非常顺利地实现了目标。那些捡便宜的人买了很多，使得我能够卖完小团队的持股。只是，你觉得戈登、伍尔夫和甘恩会感谢我吗？不可能的。他们还是对我充满了抱怨，反正他们的朋友是这么对我说的。他们常常对别人说，我是怎样收拾他们的。他们对我没拉抬股价以达成他们的心愿一直心存芥蒂。

其实，伍尔夫和其他人如果在当时不传播那些热热乎乎的内幕消息的话，我肯定是没办法卖掉10万股的。如果按照我一向的那种做法，也就是合理而自然地去操作，我就要让自己接受能卖的一切价格。我对你讲过，市场已经处于空头状态，有这样的前提，要卖出股票，不一定非要孤注一掷地做，可一定不能在价格上计较。除此之外别无他法，不过我觉得他们可能不相信我的这个观点。他们三人还是对我气呼呼的，而我却很平和。发怒不是什么好事。我经历过的那些不止一次的教训使我明白，爱生气的投机分子是没什么前途的。在这件事情上，他们生气并没为我留下什么后续的麻烦。可我要对你说的是，发生了一件奇怪的事情。有一天，我妻子去了一个经人推荐的女裁缝师那里。她是一个水平很高的裁缝，性格非常好，服务态度也不差。这是我妻子第三或第四次去，裁缝跟我妻子已经比较熟悉了。裁缝对她说：“我希望利文斯顿先生能够把联合炉具的股价拉抬起来，我们手里握着一些它们的股票，因为有人对我们说他要拉抬这只股票，我们向来就听说他经手的所有股票交易都非常成功。”

我对你讲，一想到那些无辜的人们因为听了那些所谓的内幕消息而损失了钱财，我就很不愉快。或许，如今你会明白，我为什么从来不对人说什么内幕消息。女裁缝的话让我感觉到，要说怨气，该由我对伍尔夫来发才对。





第二十三章


股票投机生意是永远不会消失的，人们也不希望它消失，那些关于投机有多危险的劝诫也不可能阻止投机。无论人们能力多强，或者有多么丰富的经验，都不可能不出错。那些意料不到和没办法预估的事情总会发生，导致你小心翼翼做的计划最终失败。厄运可能来自天灾或气候，可能来自人的贪欲或虚荣，也可能来自恐惧或对希望的不可遏制。可是，除了那些被叫作天敌的东西外，股票投机商们必须要与一些做法对抗，或者要能解决在正常情况下和商业土壤中不可以立足的恶行。

回想25年前我刚到华尔街那些司空见惯的行为时，必须要承认，很多东西已经好多了。旧的那种交易场所已经被淘汰，可是存在欺诈行为的交易所却还是生意很红火，残害着那些致力于一夜暴富的男女们。证券交易所做得非常好，不光查处了那些骗子，也始终要求会员公司严格遵守规则，实施了很多健全的法律法规，不过还是存在值得改进的地方，也存在一些恶行，这是由华尔街长期培植的保守习惯导致的，而不是源于人们道德上的麻木。

股票投机商赚钱历来都是很难的事，如今更是难上加难。不久前，真正的交易商们在每只股票上差不多都有操作的知识。1901年，摩根公司在纽交所推出了由一些小型联合公司组成的美国钢铁公司股票，那时只有275只股票挂牌，没上市的大概100只，里面有很多股价没必要知晓，因为都是微小股、次要股或保证股，没有活跃的交易，所以也就没有多少人愿意投入。实际上在一年中，大多数股票连一次都没交易过。而今天，正常的挂牌股票就有900只，最近交易活跃的大概是600只。而且，原来的股票容易按类股分类跟踪，当时的类股很少，资本额又不大。股民们需要知道的消息，也没有多大的涵盖面。可今天你却能够对每一只股票进行交易，全球的哪个行业都有股票上市。只有花费更多时间和精力，才能使自己的消息灵通。光这一点对聪明的股民们来说就已经知道投机比原来艰难了很多。

做股票交易生意的人成千上万，可真正获得利润的却很少。从某种程度上来看，人们总徘徊在股市中，常常受到损失。缺乏知识、贪欲太盛、担心过大和希望太强，都是股票投机人的致命弱点。世界上所有的法令和证交所的规则都不能把它们从人的本性中赶跑。出乎意料的事会击碎认真做过的计划，头脑清晰的经济学家和乐善好施的慈善家都没办法制止那样的事。另一种导致亏损的来源，是那些故意提供误导的不同于直接内幕消息的信息造成的。这样的信息往往包裹在不同的伪装里，在股民们中间传播，这是更阴森、更危险的敌人。

普通的外部人士自然要凭借口头或文字性的、直接的或间接的内幕消息来交易。你无法抗拒正常的内幕消息，比如与你一直要好的朋友很真诚地想帮你赚钱，所以对你说了他做的事情，买卖了什么股票。他怀着好心，可要是消息有误，你怎么办？而且，在专业人士或者骗子们传播消息这方面，股民们受到的保护，与他在面临假钱和假酒侵害上受到的保护差不多。可是，在与纯种的华尔街谣言对抗方面，投机人没有得到任何保护和补偿。很多从事证券销售的商人、作手、内线或者个人，以不同形式与方法，帮股民按最理想的价格交易股票。报纸和股市行情传出来的有关多头市场的报道都是很致命的。

随便拿哪天的报纸财经版看，都会惊奇地看到它刊登着一些暗示是来自半官方的声明，都是“重要内线”“知名董事”“公司高管”“权威人士”等所提供的消息。人们都觉得他们说得很有道理。下面是今天的报道，我随便选了一个：“银行界领袖说，现在说空头市场会出现还为时尚早，不能断言。”

说话的真是一位银行领袖？他为什么这么说？又为什么不报出姓名？是不是怕报出姓名后大家不相信？

还有一条与这周股票交易比较活跃的一家公司有关的消息，是一位“知名董事”所说。好吧，要真有这么一个人，那么他是这家公司那么多董事中的哪一个？诚然，不署名的爆料即便出错为别人带来了损失，也没办法责怪。

股票交易人要很明智地研究各地的交易市场，还要考虑与炒股游戏相关的事情；要想办法搞清楚怎么赚钱和怎么才不会亏损，要明白什么该做、什么不该做也非常重要。所以，你最好记清楚，一种炒作差不多会出现在个股的任何涨势中，这是内线们发起的涨势，就是为了能卖出赚钱的股票。可普通的交易公司的顾客们觉得，如果顽固地去挖掘一只股票上涨的原因，就是个刨根究底的聪明人。作手们肯定会按照特意布置的有利于卖出股票的手段来解释涨势。我坚定地觉得，如果主管部门不让报纸刊发不报姓名的利多言论，那股民们赔的钱就会少很多。我说的是那种特别策划的引导人们交易股票的言论。

利用不报姓名的董事和内线人士言论的大多数报道，向人们传达的都是不值得信赖的信息。股民们觉得消息性质是半官方的，就有必要相信，因此每年都会赔掉成百上千万美元。

比如说，某家公司的某项业务在某段时间比较疲软，公司股票很不受人待见。它在普通股民们心中的价值表现就是股价，而且可能是真实的价值。假如这个价位的股价便宜，就会有人知道这一点，接着去买进，股价就涨高；假如这个价位的股价贵，有人知道后就会卖，股价也就下跌。不存在这两种情况的话，人们就不会议论它，不会对它采取行动。

是谁最早知道公司业务有了好转？公司内部人士还是普通股民？肯定不是普通股民。然后会出现什么事？假如一直处于好转状态，盈余就会增多，公司就有恢复配股息的机会，如果一直不断裂，股利率就会提高。也就是说，股票的价值会变高。

如果情况持续好转的话，经营者会不会对外讲这个让人开心的事情？总裁会对股东们说吗？哪位好心的董事会有名有姓地告诉看报纸的读者们吗？那些谦虚的内线们会跟往常一样不报姓名地说公司的前景非常好吗？不会！没人会说，报纸和股票报价机器上都不会有任何信息。

他们会小心谨慎地阻止这类股票增值的消息传播，那些不怎么说话的著名内线会在股市中尽力获取能买到的所有贱股。这样的状况在持续的时候，股价就会上涨。财经版的读者们清楚，内线们知道股价为什么上涨，所以会去问。都不愿意透露姓名的内线人士会统一口径地说，他们没什么可透露，不知道为什么上涨。他们有时还会说自己并不太重视股市的奇怪行情，不重视股票投机者们的所作所为。

股价上涨到了让人们兴奋的时候，了解内情的人也买够了他们想买进或有能力买进的股票，华尔街上就会再次出现各种利多的传言。“按照权威人士透露的消息”，电报机会把公司的确由逆境转到顺境状态的消息让股民们知道。一位谦虚谨慎的董事以前会说，他不知道股票上涨的原因，而此时他的话却在人们口中被引述出来：股东们有对公司未来非常看好的充足理由。当然了，他还是没有透露姓名。

股民们受到洪水般的利好消息的蛊惑，开始购买那只股票，这就会使股价更高。时机成熟后，全部不愿意透露姓名的董事们的预测就很准啊，公司恢复了股利分配，甚至可能增加股利。如此消息弥散后，利多的消息铺天盖地，数量大增，传播消息的人也变得热情。当人们请某个重要董事直接讲明情形时，他会告诉全世界，好转现象不只是能持续而已；某位重要内线架不住人们的请求，最终在报社怂恿下，说公司盈余非常之高；某个与公司关系紧密的著名银行家也在别人请求下说，股票销售量增多，简直创造了这个行业的交易历史，在没有其他订单的前提下，公司日夜不停歇地运转，还不知道需要多少个月才能完成目前手里的业务量；某个财政委员会成员的表述在报纸上通过特殊处理后会变成，他很惊讶人们怎么会对这只股票上涨颇感意外。让人震惊的唯一现象是，股价上涨的速度慢了下来。不管谁去对公司将发出的年报进行分析，都能随便看出来，这只股票净值要远高于市场价。不过，那些善于与人们沟通的好心人不管在哪种情况下，都是不愿意透露姓名的。

公司内线人士只要看到盈余还在增长，没出现公司运气要减弱的表现，他们就会牢牢地握住低价回购的股票。没有什么让股价降低，他们凭什么要卖？不过，公司业务变得很差劲的时候，你看会出现什么情况？他们会发出声明、警告或一点儿小暗示吗？不可能。正如当时公司业务好的时候，他们没有大张旗鼓地买进股票一样，此时公司业务走下坡路了，他们必定也在偷偷地卖出。公司内线的卖出导致股价下跌，股民们紧接着就听到了一些熟悉的说法。一个重要内线人士咬紧牙说什么都很通畅，出现的小下跌是一些空头在掼压这只股票，想对整个股市施加些影响而已。如果某个时候，经过一阵下跌后的股价出现暴跌的情况，那么就会有更多的声音要求说明原因，给出解释。只要有人解释清楚就好，不然人们就会非常担心出现那种最可怕的情况。所以，如今新闻媒体的印刷机上正在印着这些报道：“当我们要求公司的一位重要董事解释清楚，为什么股价会这么糟糕时，他说导致今天股价下跌的唯一原因，就是那些空头在掼压。不过大趋势还没有发生变化，公司现在业务非常繁忙。而且，下次开会时，非常有可能会讨论提高股利分配比率的问题，除非出现预料之外的突发情况。市场空头们太猖狂了，股价不景气是他们掼压的结果，他们就是为了卖掉手里不好的股票。”新闻媒体为了让新闻更权威，可能还会补充写道，他们获悉了可靠消息，完全是由公司内线人士在股价下跌的这一天吃进了大多数股票，而那些空头会明白自作孽不可活，自己陷入了自己挖的陷阱，迟早会付出代价。

股民们对那些利多说法信以为真，买了好多股票，结果赔了钱，除此之外也有人因为受别人蛊惑，放弃了卖出而赔钱。防止人们卖那些重要内线们不想支持或不想买进的同一只股，是除了让人们买进他们想卖出的那只股票外第二好的办法。股民们看到重要董事的说法后，会相信什么？自然是相信这只股肯定不会下跌，而是空头掼压的表现，一旦空头停止卖出，内线们就会大反攻，对空头们施以惩戒，到那时空头们必须要用更多的钱来回补。人们绝对对这个观点信心十足，如果股票下跌确实是空头们掼压的结果，那么后续发展也就会如他们所想。

这只股票的价格并没有反弹。虽然出现了很多威胁和承诺，说要轧死那些放肆的空头，可股价还在下跌。怎么可能不跌，公司内线人士把那么多股票卖了出去，市场根本消化不过来。而且，重要董事和内线人士卖向市场的那一批股票，被专业的交易商们来回踢皮球。股价持续下跌，好像没有到头的时候。公司内线们清楚，业务情况对公司以后的盈余有严重的影响，因此在公司业务情况再次出现好转之前，没胆量再支撑股票了。等到有所好转时，内线们又会一点儿都不对外张扬，悄悄买进。

我做交易很多年，对市场消息非常灵通。我可以这么说，没有哪次的股价大跌是空头掼压的结果。通常意义上的掼压，实际上只是精确掌握了实际情况后卖掉股票而已。可如果说是内线不支持或者卖出股票而导致了股价下跌，却也行不通，这样的话，谁都要赶紧卖出股票，没有人买进，情况就会变得惨不忍睹。

人们应该牢记，股价持续下跌，真实的原因并非空头掼压的结果。当一只股票一直下跌，你就能确定里面必定出什么事了，不是因为市场，就是因为公司内部。假如下跌是没什么原因的，那么等股价下跌到真正的价值以下，就会有人购买，跌势也会被拉止。其实，只有当股价特别高时，空头在卖出时才能赚很大利润。你可以用你的最后那份钱做赌，内线人士必定不会对外宣布这个真实情况。

纽海文铁路公司就是其中的代表性事例。今天所有人都知道，可在当时却只有极少的人了解。1902年，他们的股票价格达到了255美元，在新英格兰地区，是数一数二的铁路投资标靶。东北部的人就是根据是不是持有这只股票，来判断某人在社区里有多么受尊敬，或者有多大威信。如果有人说这家公司很快要倒闭，是不会被抓进监狱的，可他会被当成疯子一样，关进精神病院。可是，当摩根任命了一位闯劲十足的新总裁后，悲惨的情况开始了。起初，人们并没想到新的政策会把公司拉到最终那个地步。但是，当资金一次次地以浮夸价投入进去后，有些高瞻远瞩的观察家们就开始对此提出了质疑。按照200万买进的一套电车系统，一转手就可以按照1000万卖给纽海文铁路公司。此时，公司委员会里会有一两个不计后果的成员，对管理层的莽撞行事表示不齿，犯了不尊敬上级的罪过。他们的意思是，即便是纽海文这样有实力的公司，也不能胡乱挥霍。这些话脆弱渺小，起不了任何作用，就像你想要向直布罗陀海峡里的礁石发出挑战一般。

首先看出灾难迹象的肯定是公司内线人士，他们对公司的真实情况逐步进行掌握，然后卖出持股。经过他们的卖出，在新英格兰地区非常贵气而富有的纽海文铁路股票开始掉价。人们如像以往那般质疑，要求给予解释，而解释也如以往那般果真出现了。有重要内线放话说，他们不知道哪里有问题，股价下跌是因为愣头青的空头在掼压。因此，在新英格兰地区的所谓投资者们继续把他们的纽约、纽海文和哈特弗铁路公司的股票握在手里。是啊，他们有什么理由不继续握着呢？内线人士都说了是空头在放空，没什么问题嘛，公司不也还在说要发放红利吗？

原本公司董事承诺出现的轧空也没实现，出现的只是更低的股价记录。内线人士制造的卖压更加紧张了，也逐渐摆在了明面上。波士顿的那些具备公益素养的人，以及代表民意的出头人向发行方提出要求，让他们对这样的境况做出解释，到底是什么原因使得新英格兰地区那些本想稳当赚点儿钱的所有人，都蒙受了特大的损失，但他们却被指责为股票投机分子。

这只股票从255美元暴跌到了12美元，这绝不是、也不可能是空头掼压造成的。空头没有引发股票下跌，也不是他们造成了跌势无法停止。公司的内线人士一直在卖，抛售价要高于他们说明真实情况或者允许真实情况被人们知道时候的价格。无论股价是250美元、200美元、150美元，还是100美元，甚至50美元、25美元，对这只股票而言都属于高价，内线们很清楚，只是股民们不知道。如果股民们想通过交易某家公司的股票来赚钱，而事先就知道这家公司的业务状况只有一少部分人才能有办法完全了解，那可能会对他有利。

在过去的20年里，出现过的跌势最严重的股票，下跌原因都不是空头掼压造成的，而人们那么容易就接受这样的理由，正是他们亏损成百上千万的原因。那样的说法，让不喜欢这种股价变动态势的人没有出售股票，他们把希望寄托在空头停止掼压后的股价反弹上，不然也可能卖掉股票。我以前听到过别人抱怨凯恩，更早之前，人们习惯于骂查理·伍利雪弗和爱迪生·卡马克，而后来，我自己也成了股市的代罪羊。

我记得有关山谷石油公司的那件事情。这家公司的股票是被公司内线集团操控的，他们拉抬股价，也找到了在上涨的时候买进的股民。这些作手们把股价炒到了50美元，然后卖出手中的股票，股价就暴跌了。然后，人们一如既往地求解释，山谷石油股票为什么这么羸弱？有大量提问的人，对问题的回答也就成了新闻。一家财经媒体去采访最了解山谷石油公司股票上涨内幕消息的一个经纪商，作为炒作集团成员的他，对股票为什么下跌也一样清楚。报纸请他说一个可以向全国范围内刊登报道的原因。哦，那当然是拉里·利文斯顿打压股市引发的啦。除此之外，他还补上一句，说要准备收拾我。可山谷石油公司内线人士依然在出售，当时股价大概12美元，他们甚至可以卖到10美元以下，平均卖价还是要高于他们的成本。

公司内线把价格拉低后卖出股票是精明的做法，也做得恰到好处，而对那些花费了35美元或40美元的不知道内情的外人而言就不一样了。他们读到印刷机印出来的报纸报道后，就紧抱着股票不放手，还等着看利文斯顿被内线集团抓住后狠狠地修理一番呢。

在牛市里，特别是盛况空前的高潮期，人们最早都获得了利润，可后来都赔了本，完全是因为他们对牛市太不舍了。广大的股民要提防那种只解释不愿意透露姓名的内线人士希望股民相信的解释。





第二十四章


人们都喜欢从别人口中得到消息，这就是内幕消息能这么普遍地被传播与接受的原因。经纪商通过自己的市场通讯杂志和口耳相传，给顾客有关交易的建议很适当。可也不该对实际情况讨论得过于详尽，因为实际情况比股市走向要滞后六到九个月。今天，公司的盈余没有为经纪商提供足够充分的理由，让他去建议股民们购买这只股票，除非对六到九个月后的情况有把握，对业务的预估能保证维持住同样的获利率。假若你能清晰地看到这么长时间以后的事，能够看明白股市未来走向跟目前实际状况不同，那现在关于讨论股价便宜的说法就不会存在了。交易者要高瞻远瞩，可经纪商们关心的只是赚眼前的手续费，所以那些普通证券商发行的杂志里，有很多避不开的误断。证券商赚的钱是来自大众手里的手续费，他们也想尽办法用手中的杂志诱导股民，让他们买那些内线和作手卖出的股票。

我们会经常看到，公司内线人士会去拜访证券公司的老板，然后说：“我希望你能搭建一个市场，替我卖出5万股。”

证券商让他说得更加详细些。比如这只股票的报价是50美元，内线人士对证券商说：“我向你提供5000股买进选择权，每股45美元；每升高2个点，就给你5000股，总共给你5万股。此外，我也按照市价给你5万股的卖出选择权。”

只要证券商有很多跟随的粉丝，那这样的钱对他来说就非常容易赚，公司内线人士需要的就是粉丝。如果哪家证券商有联通分公司和全美国各地交易所的直拨电话，遇到这样的股市交易，就会找到特别多的追随粉丝。你要记住，不管怎么样，因为有卖出选择权，这家证券交易商做的是绝对有把握的事情。假若他能拉一批跟进的人，也就可以卖出他全部的持股，赚取一大笔利润，还有基本的手续费。

我想到了华尔街一位著名“内鬼”所干的一番成就。

他会拜访一家大型证券交易公司的资深营业员，甚至在有的时候，他会进一步去与公司某个小股东见面。他说的差不多都是这样的话：“你看哈，老伙计，你们帮了我好多次忙，我非常感谢。我要向你们提供一个能正儿八经赚到钱的机会。我们正在组建一家能够吸纳我们一家关系公司资产的新公司。我们会拉抬这只股票，股价会在现价的基础上有很大的涨幅。我准备以每股65美元转给你们500股班塔姆商店的股票。这只股票目前的价格是72美元。”

内线人士怀着莫大的感激之情，把这个好消息讲给好几家证券交易公司的几十位资深营业员们听。得到了内线人士所提供的礼物的那些人都在华尔街谋生，当他们获得了一部分有钱可赚的股票后，会做什么呢？他会对自己能找到的每个人提出建议，让他们买这只股。那些好心的送礼内线人很清楚这个。这些人就这样帮助内线人士，搭建了一个市场，让他们能用高价把手里的股票卖给可怜的股民们。

有一些对外出售股票的方式需要被禁止。证交所应该制止那些挂牌上市的股票按照分期付款的办法出售给普通股民。有正式的报价会对每一只股票都产生约束。此外，进入自由市场的正式证据和有时的价格差距，就是一只股票所需的全部诱饵。

还有一种出售股票的方法也比较常见，能给不善于思考的股民们带来成千上百万的损失，可却没有使任何一个操作者被抓。因为这种操作是合法的，以市场需求为基础，增加股本。这种程序并没有完全改变股票的颜色。

用老股票换新股票，不管是1股换2股、4股，还是10股，这样做的目的往往是想让旧股票变得容易出售而已。1磅包装的东西用1美元很难卖出去，换成1/4磅包装的用25美分就可能会卖出去，甚至还有可能卖到27美分或者30美分呢。

为什么人们不探究股票要变得容易出售的原因？这也是华尔街上慈善事业的做法，可明智的交易人员需要谨慎地对付这种特洛伊木马似的东西。人们需要的所有警告就是这个。可他们不管这些，所以每年都会赔掉数百万美元。

意图制造各种谣言并传播出去，对个人或公司的业务和名誉造成伤害，就会受到法律制裁。也就是说，故意怂恿大众抛出股票，打压它的价值，就会受到惩罚。这种做法本来的意图可能是在股市不太好的时候，处罚那些对银行的规范程度明确表示怀疑的人，以此削弱挤兑消除恐慌带来的危险。而这样也对股民们不按照比股票价值低的价格卖出股票给予了保护。意思是，美国法律会惩罚那些传播利空谣言的人。

怎么样才能保护好股民，让他们不要以比股票价值高的价格去买股票呢？谁来惩处那些传播利多谣言的人？无人负责啊。可股民们在股价过高的时候，依靠不愿意透露姓名的公司内线人士的消息来买股票，为此蒙受的损失，要比在所谓掼压情形下，因为利空消息而按照比股票价值低的价格卖出时受到的损失要大。

假如能够通过法律，像惩罚一些撒谎的空头一样，对欺骗股民的多头进行惩罚的话，我相信股民们会省下几百万。

当然了，那些作手、股票承销商，以及不报出姓名而只给出乐观看法并因此拿到好处的人会对你说，不管谁依靠谣言和不知名的建议去交易赔了钱，都怪你自己。这样的话，那你也可以说，不管谁笨得吸毒成瘾，都没有受保护的资格。

证交所应该帮忙保护股民们不受那些不公正的行为的损害。哪个知晓内情的人，如果想让股民们听从他的建议，或接受他的说法，那就请他签字画押来负好责任。在利多的消息上签字负责任，并不能让消息由假变真，可却能让所谓的内线人士和董事谨慎些。

股民们该永远记住交易股票的要点。当股票上涨的时候，没必要花心力去搞清楚其中的原因。一直买进，它就会一直上涨。只要它一直涨价，偶尔有个很正常的小幅度回调，你顺着股票的涨势操作，基本上都很安全。可股价若在长时间平稳上涨以后，慢慢转成了下跌形势，偶尔有点儿反弹，那就很明显了，是股票的最小阻力线开始变为向下走了。这就是实情，还为何要去找原因呢？或许股价下跌的原因非常充分，可却只有不多的几个人明白。而他们要么不会对你说，要么把话反过来说。这就是交易游戏的本质，大家都该清楚，知道内情的那几个人是不会告诉你真相的。

不管一些所谓内线人士或董事在给出很多说法的时候是否也报出了自己的姓名，他们都没有什么依据。甚至有时候没人让内线站出来说话，那些说法都只是在股市上拥有重大利益的一些人胡乱制造的谣言。在某只股票价格上涨的某个阶段，很多手里有股票的内线为了让股票变得容易交易，是不会拒绝专业人员的帮忙的。内线人士或许会向玩得大的人说明该什么时候买，但却不会告诉他什么时候卖。这样的话，那些大作手就和普通股民在同一地位的起跑线上，不过他需要的是一个特别大的市场空间，以便能够抛售。此时，对股民们最能造成误导的消息就会出现。其实，在这个游戏的任何时候，你都不能相信一些所谓的内线人士。一般情况下，大公司的某个老板或许会根据内幕消息去股市交易。他们实际上也没撒谎，就是没说话，他们知道有时需要闭口不谈。

我不止一次地说过，再多说一次也不算唆。根据我几十年的交易经验，我相信没有谁能够从头至尾地在股市中当赢家。不过，他可能会在某种条件下的某些股票上获利。无论一个炒股的人经验多么丰富，都存在着因为出错而赔钱的可能。股票投机并不是百分百安全的事情。华尔街上的专家们很清楚，依照内幕消息采取行动，比饥荒、瘟疫、灾荒、政治变动以及那些普通的意外事故，更能让人迅速破产。在华尔街，在其他的任何一个地方，都没有一条柏油马路通向成功。既然这样，那为什么还要去做堵塞交通的事情呢？





Chapter I


I WENT to work when I was just out of grammar school．I got a job as quotation-board boy in a stock-brokerage office．I was quick at figures．At school I did three years of arithmetic in one．I was particularly good at mental arithmetic．As quotation-board boy I posted the numbers on the big board in the customers' room．One of the customers usually sat by the ticker and called out the prices．They couldn't come too fast for me．I have always remembered figures．No trouble at all．

There were plenty of other employes in that office．Of course I made friends with the other fellows，but the work I did，if the market was active，kept me too busy from ten A．M．to three P．M．to let me do much talking．I don't care for it，anyhow，during business hours．

But a busy market did not keep me from thinking about the work．Those quotations did not represent prices of stocks to me，so many dollars per share．They were numbers．Of course，they meant something．They were always changing．It was all I had to be interested in—the changes．Why did they change？I didn't know．I didn't care．I didn't think about that．I simply saw that they changed．That was all I had to think about five hours every day and two on Saturdays：that they were always changing．

That is how I first came to be interested in the behaviour of prices．I had a very good memory for figures．I could remember in detail how the prices had acted on the previous day，just before they went up or down．My fondness for mental arithmetic came in very handy．

I noticed that in advances as well as declines，stock prices were apt to show certain habits，so to speak．There was no end of parallel cases and these made precedents to guide me．I was only fourteen，but after I had taken hundreds of observations in my mind I found myself testing their accuracy，comparing the behaviour of stocks today with other days．It was not long before I was anticipating movements in prices．My only guide，as I say，was their past performances．I carried the“dope sheets”in my mind．I looked for stock prices to run on form．I had“clocked”them．You know what I mean．

You can spot，for instance，where the buying is only a trifle better than the selling．A battle goes on in the stock market and the tape is your telescope．You can depend upon it seven out of ten cases．

Another lesson I learned early is that there is nothing new in Wall Street．There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills．Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again．I've never forgotten that．I suppose I really manage to remember when and how it happened．The fact that I remember that way is my way of capitalizing experience．

I got so interested in my game and so anxious to anticipate advances and declines in all the active stocks that I got a little book．I put down my observations in it．It was not a record of imaginary transactions such as so many people keep merely to make or lose millions of dollars without getting the swelled head or going to the poorhouse．It was rather a sort of record of my hits and misses，and next to the determination of probable movements I was most interested in verifying whether I had observed accurately；in other words，whether I was right．

Say that after studying every fluctuation of the day in an active stock I would conclude that it was behaving as it always did before it broke eight or ten points．Well，I would jot down the stock and the price on Monday，and remembering past performances I would write down what it ought to do on Tuesday and Wednesday．Later I would check up with actual transcriptions from the tape．

That is how I first came to take an interest in the message of the tape．The fluctuations were from the first associated in my mind with upward or downward movements．Of course there is always a reason for fluctuations，but the tape does not concern itself with the why and wherefore．It doesn't go into explanations．I didn't ask the tape why when I was fourteen，and I don't ask it today，at forty．The reason for what a certain stock does today may not be known for two or three days，or weeks，or months．But what the dickens does that matter？Your business with the tape is now—not tomorrow．The reason can wait．But you must act instantly or be left．Time and again I see this happen．You'll remember that Hollow Tube went down three points the other day while the rest of the market rallied sharply．That was the fact．On the following Monday you saw that the directors passed the dividend．That was the reason．They knew what they were going to do，and even if they didn't sell the stock themselves they at least didn't buy it．There was no inside buying；no reason why it should not break．

Well，I kept up my little memorandum book perhaps six months．Instead of leaving for home the moment I was through with my work，I'd jot down the figures I wanted and would study the changes，always looking for the repetitions and parallelisms of behaviour—learning to read the tape，although I was not aware of it at the time．

One day one of the office boys—he was older than I—came to me where I was eating my lunch and asked me on the quiet if I had any money．

“Why do you want to know？”I said．

“Well，”he said，“I've got a dandy tip on Burlington．I'm going to play it if I can get somebody to go in with me．”

“How do you mean，play it？”I asked．To me the only people who played or could play tips were the customers—old jiggers with oodles of dough．Why，it cost hundreds，even thousands of dollars，to get into the game．It was like owning your private carriage and having a coachman who wore a silk hat．

“That's what I mean；play it！”he said．“How much you got？”

“How much you need？”

“Well，I can trade in five shares by putting up $5．”

“How are you going to play it？”

“I'm going to buy all the Burlington the bucket shop will let me carry with the money I give him for margin，”he said．“It's going up sure．It's like picking up money．We'll double ours in a jiffy．”

“Hold on！”I said to him，and pulled out my little dope book．

I wasn't interested in doubling my money，but in his saying that Burlington was going up．If it was，my notebook ought to show it．I looked．Sure enough，Burlington，according to my figuring，was acting as it usually did before it went up．I had never bought or sold anything in my life，and I never gambled with the other boys．But all I could see was that this was a grand chance to test the accuracy of my work，of my hobby．It struck me at once that if my dope didn't work in practice there was nothing in the theory of it to interest anybody．So I gave him all I had，and with our pooled resources he went to one of the nearby bucket shops and bought some Burlington．Two days later we cashed in．I made a profit Of $3.12．

After that first trade，I got to speculating on my own hook in the bucket shops．I'd go during my lunch hour and buy or sell—it never made any difference to me．I was playing a system and not a favorite stock or backing opinions．All I knew was the arithmetic of it．As a matter of fact，mine was the ideal way to operate in a bucket shop，where all that a trader does is to bet on fluctuations as they are printed by the ticker on the tape．

It was not long before I was taking much more money out of the bucket shops than I was pulling down from my job in the brokerage office．So I gave up my position．My folks objected，but they couldn't say much when they saw what I was making．I was only a kid and office-boy wages were not very high．I did mighty well on my own hook．

I was fifteen when I had my first thousand and laid the cash in front of my mother—all made in the bucket shops in a few months，besides what I had taken home．My mother carried on something awful．She wanted me to put it away in the savings bank out of reach of temptation．She said it was more money than she ever heard any boy of fifteen had made，starting with nothing．She didn't quite believe it was real money．She used to worry and fret about it．But I didn't think of anything except that I could keep on proving my figuring was right．That's all the fun there is being right by using your head．If I was right when I tested my convictions with ten shares I would be ten times more right if I traded in a hundred shares．That is all that having more margin meant to me—I was right more emphatically．More courage？No！No difference！If all I have is ten dollars and I risk it，I am much braver than when I risk a million，if I have another million salted away．

Anyhow，at fifteen I was making a good living out of the stock market．I began in the smaller bucket shops，where the man who traded in twenty shares at a clip was suspected of being John W．Gates in disguise or J．P．Morgan traveling incognito．Bucket shops in those days seldom lay down on their customers．They didn't have to．There were other ways of parting customers from their money，even when they guessed right．The business was tremendously profitable．When it was conducted legitimately—I mean straight，as far as the bucket shop went—the fluctuations took care of the shoestrings．It doesn't take much of a reaction to wipe out a margin of only three quarters of a point．Also，no welsher could ever get back in the game．Wouldn't have any trade．

I didn't have a following．I kept my business to myself．It was a one-man business，anyhow．It was my head，wasn't it？Prices either were going the way I doped them out，without any help from friends or partners，or they were going the other way，and nobody could stop them out of kindness to me．I couldn't see where I needed to tell my business to anybody else．I've got friends，of course，but my business has always been the same—a one-man affair．That is why I have always played a lone hand．

As it was，it didn't take long for the bucket shops to get sore on me for beating them．I'd walk in and plank down my margin，but they'd look at it without making a move to grab it．They'd tell me there was nothing doing．That was the time they got to calling me the Boy Plunger．I had to be changing brokers all the time，going from one bucket shop to another．It got so that I had to give a fictitious name．I'd begin light，only fifteen or twenty shares．At times，when they got suspicious，I'd lose on purpose at first and then sting them proper．Of course after a little while they'd find me too expensive and they'd tell me to take myself and my business elsewhere and not interfere with the owners' dividends．

Once，when the big concern I'd been trading with for months shut down on me I made up my mind to take a little more of their money away from them．That bucket shop had branches all over the city，in hotel lobbies，and in nearby towns．I went to one of the hotel branches and asked the manager a few questions and finally got to trading．But as soon as I played an active stock my especial way he began to get messages from the head office asking who it was that was operating．The manager told me what they asked him and I told him my name was Edward Robinson，of Cambridge．He telephoned the glad news to the big chief．But the other end wanted to know what I looked like．When the manager told me that I said to him，“Tell him I am a short fat man with dark hair and a bushy beard！”But he described me instead，and then he listened and his face got red and he hung up and told me to beat it．

“What did they say to you？”I asked him politely．

“They said，‘You blankety-blank fool，didn't we tell you to take no business from Larry Livingston？And you deliberately let him trim us out of $700！’”He didn't say what else they told him．

I tried the other branches one after another，but they all got to know me，and my money wasn't any good in any of their offices．I couldn't even go in to look at the quotations without some of the clerks making cracks at me．I tried to get them to let me trade at long intervals by dividing my visits among them all．But that didn't work．

Finally there was only one left to me and that was the biggest and richest of all—the Cosmopolitan Stock Brokerage Company．

The Cosmopolitan was rated as A-1 and did an enormous business．It had branches in every manufacturing town in New England．They took my trading all right，and I bought and sold stocks and made and lost money for months，but in the end it happened with them as usual．They didn't refuse my business point-blank，as the small concerns had．Oh，not because it wasn't sportsmanship，but because they knew it would give them a black eye to publish the news that they wouldn't take a fellow's business just because that fellow happened to make a little money．But they did the next worse thing—that is，they made me put up a three-point margin and compelled me to pay a premium at first of a half point，then a point，and finally，a point and a half．Some handicap，that！How？Easy！Suppose Steel was selling at 90 and you bought it．Your ticket read，normally：“Bot ten Steel at 90．”If you put up a point margin it meant that if it broke 89¼ 8 you were wiped out automatically．In a bucket shop the customer is not importuned for more margin or put to the painful necessity of telling his broker to sell for anything he can get．

But when the Cosmopolitan tacked on that premium they were hitting below the belt．It meant that if the price was 90 when I bought，instead of making my ticket：“Bot Steel at 90，”it read：“Bot Steel at 91．”Why，8 that stock could advance a point and a quarter after I bought it and I'd still be losing money if I closed the trade．And by also insisting that I put up a three-point margin at the very start they reduced my trading capacity by two thirds．Still，that was the only bucket shop that would take my business at all，and I had to accept their terms or quit trading．

Of course I had my ups and downs，but was a winner on balance．However，the Cosmopolitan people were not satisfied with the awful handicap they had tacked on me，which should have been enough to beat anybody．They tried to double-cross me．They didn't get me．I escaped because of one of my hunches．

The Cosmopolitan，as I said，was my last resort．It was the richest bucket shop in New England，and as a rule they put no limit on a trade．I think I was the heaviest individual trader they had—that is，of the steady，everyday customers．They had a fine office and the largest and completest quotation board I have ever seen anywhere．It ran along the whole length of the big room and every imaginable thing was quoted．I mean stocks dealt in on the New York and Boston Stock Exchanges，cotton，wheat，provisions，metals—everything that was bought and sold in New York，Chicago，Boston and Liverpool．

You know how they traded in bucket shops．You gave your money to a clerk and told him what you wished to buy or sell．He looked at the tape or the quotation board and took the price from there—the last one，of course．He also put down the time on the ticket so that it almost read like a regular broker's report—that is，that they had bought or sold for you so many shares of such a stock at such a price at such a time on such a day and how much money they received from you．When you wished to close your trade you went to the clerk—the same or another，it depended on the shop—and you told him．He took the last price or if the stock had not been active he waited for the next quotation that came out on the tape．He wrote that price and the time on your ticket，O．K．'d it and gave it back to you，and then you went to the cashier and got whatever cash it called for．Of course，when the market went against you and the price went beyond the limit set by your margin，your trade automatically closed itself and your ticket became one more scrap of paper．

In the humbler bucket shops，where people were allowed to trade in as little as five shares，the tickets were little slips—different colors for buying and selling—and at times，as for instance in boiling bull market，the shop would be hard hit because all the customers were bulls and happened to be right．Then the bucket shop would deduct both buying and selling commissions and if you bought a stock at 20 the ticket would read 20 ¼．You thus had only ¾ of a point's run for your money．

But the Cosmopolitan was the finest in New England．It had thousands of patrons and I really think I was the only man they were afraid of．Neither the killing premium nor the three-point margin they made me put up reduced my trading much．I kept on buying and selling as much as they'd let me．I sometimes had a line of 5,000 shares．

Well，on the day the thing happened that I am going to tell you，I was short thirty-five hundred shares of Sugar．I had seven big pink tickets for five hundred shares each．The Cosmopolitan used big slips with a blank space on them where they could write down additional margin．Of course，the bucket shops never ask for more margin．The thinner the shoestring the better for them，for their profit lies in your being wiped．In the smaller shops if you wanted to margin your trade still further they'd make out a new ticket，so they could charge you the buying commission and only give you a run of ¾ of a point on each point's decline，for they figured the selling commission also exactly as if it were a new trade．

Well，this day I remember I had up over $10,000 in margins．

I was only twenty when I first accumulated ten thousand dollars in cash．And you ought to have heard my mother．You'd have thought that ten thousand dollars in cash was more than anybody carried around except old John D.，and she used to tell me to be satisfied and go into some regular business．I had a hard time convincing her that I was not gambling，but making money by figuring．But all she could see was that ten thousand dollars was a lot of money and all I could see was more margin．

I had put out my 3500 shares of Sugar at 105¼．There was another fellow in the room，Henry Williams，who was short 2500 shares．I used to sit by the ticker and call out the quotations for the board boy．The price behaved as I thought it would．It promptly went down a couple of points and paused a little to get its breath before taking another dip．The general market was pretty soft and everything looked promising．Then all of a sudden I didn't like the way Sugar was doing its hesitating．I began to feel uncomfortable．I thought I ought to get out of the market．Then it sold at 103—that was low for the day—but instead of feeling more confident I felt more uncertain．I knew something was wrong somewhere，but I couldn't spot it exactly．But if something was coming and I didn't know where from，I couldn't be on my guard against it．That being the case I'd better be out of the market．

You know，I don't do things blindly．I don't like to．I never did．Even as a kid I had to know why I should do certain things．But this time I had no definite reason to give to myself，and yet I was so uncomfortable that I couldn't stand it．I called to a fellow I knew，Dave Wyman，and said to him：“Dave，you take my place here．I want you to do something for me．Wait a little before you call out the next price of Sugar，will you？”

He said he would，and I got up and gave him my place by the ticker so he could call out the prices for the boy．I took my seven Sugar tickets out of my pocket and walked over to the counter，to where the clerk was who marked the tickets when you closed your trades．But I didn't really know why I should get out of the market，so I just stood there，leaning against the counter，my tickets in my hand so that the clerk couldn't see them．Pretty soon I heard the clicking of a telegraph instrument and I saw Tom Burnham，the clerk，turn his head quickly and listen．Then I felt that something crooked was hatching，and I decided not to wait any longer．Just then Dave Wyman by the ticker，began：“Su—”and quick as a flash I slapped my tickets on the counter in front of the clerk and yelled，“Close Sugar！”before Dave had finished calling the price．So，of course，the house had to close my Sugar at the last quotation．What Dave called turned out to be 103 again．

According to my dope Sugar should have broken 103 by now．The engine wasn't hitting right．I had the feeling that there was a trap in the neighbourhood．At all events，the telegraph instrument was now going like mad and I noticed that Tom Burnham，the clerk，had left my tickets unmarked where I laid them，and was listening to the clicking as if he were waiting for something．So I yelled at him：“Hey，Tom，what in hell are you waiting for？Mark the price on these tickets—103！Get a gait on！”

Everybody in the room heard me and began to look toward us and ask what was the trouble，for，you see，while the Cosmopolitan had never laid down，there was no telling，and a run on a bucket shop can start like a run on a bank．If one customer gets suspicious the others follow suit．So Tom looked sulky，but came over and marked my tickets“Closed at 103”and shoved the seven of them over toward me．He sure had a sour face．

Say，the distance from Tom's place to the cashier's cage wasn't over eight feet．But I hadn't got to the cashier to get my money when Dave Wyman by the ticker yelled excitedly：“Gosh！Sugar，108！”But it was too late；so I just laughed and called over to Tom，“It didn't work that time，did it，old boy？”

Of course，it was a put-up job．Henry Williams and I together were short six thousand shares of Sugar．That bucket shop had my margin and Henry's，and there may have been a lot of other Sugar shorts in the office；possibly eight or ten thousand shares in all．Suppose they had $20,000 in Sugar margins．That was enough to pay the shop to thimblerig the market on the New York Stock Exchange and wipe us out．In the old days whenever a bucket shop found itself loaded with too many bulls on a certain stock it was a common practice to get some broker to wash down the price of that particular stock far enough to wipe out all the customers that were long of it．This seldom cost the bucket shop more than a couple of points on a few hundred shares，and they made thousands of dollars．

That was what the Cosmopolitan did to get me and Henry Williams and the other Sugar shorts．Their brokers in New York ran up the price to 108．Of course it fell right back，but Henry and a lot of others were wiped out．Whenever there was an unexplained sharp drop which was followed by instant recovery，the newspapers in those days used to call it a bucket-shop drive．

And the funniest thing was that not later than ten days after the Cosmopolitan people tried to double-cross me a New York operator did them out of over seventy thousand dollars．This man，who was quite a market factor in his day and a member of the New York Stock Exchange，made a great name for himself as a bear during the Bryan panic of '96．He was forever running up against Stock Exchange rules that kept him from carrying out some of his plans at the expense of his fellow members．One day he figured that there would be no complaints from either the Exchange or the police authorities if he took from the bucket shops of the land some of their ill-gotten gains．In the instance I speak of he sent thirty-five men to act as customers．They went to the main office and to the bigger branches．On a certain day at a fixed hour the agents all bought as much of a certain stock as the managers would let them．They had instructions to sneak out at a certain profit．Of course what he did was to distribute bull tips on that stock among his cronies and then he went in to the floor of the Stock Exchange and bid up the price，helped by the room traders，who thought he was a good sport．Being careful to pick out the right stock for that work，there was no trouble in putting up the price three or four points．His agents at the bucket shops cashed in as prearranged．

A fellow told me the originator cleaned up seventy thousand dollars net，and his agents made their expenses and their pay besides．He played that game several times all over the country，punishing the bigger bucket shops of New York，Boston，Philadelphia，Chicago，Cincinnati and St．Louis．One of his favorite stocks was Western Union，because it was so easy to move a semiactive stock like that a few points up or down．His agents bought it at a certain figure，sold at two points profit，went short and took three points more．By the way，I read the other day that that man died，poor and obscure．If he had died in 1896 he would have got at least a column on the first page of every New York paper．As it was he got two lines on the fifth．





Chapter II


BETWEEN the discovery that the Cosmopolitan Stock Brokerage Company was ready to beat me by foul means if the killing handicap of a three-point margin and a point-and-a-half premium didn't do it，and hints that they didn't want my business anyhow，I soon made up my mind to go to New York，where I could trade in the office of some member of the New York Stock Exchange．I didn't want any Boston branch，where the quotations had to be telegraphed．I wanted to be close to the original source．I came to New York at the age of 21，bringing with me all I had，twenty-five hundred dollars．

I told you I had ten thousand dollars when I was twenty，and my margin on that Sugar deal was over ten thousand．But I didn't always win．My plan of trading was sound enough and won oftener than it lost．If I had stuck to it I'd have been right perhaps as often as seven out of ten times．In fact，I always made money when I was sure I was right before I began．What beat me was not having brains enough to stick to my own game—that is，to play the market only when I was satisfied that precedents favored my play．There is a time for all things，but I didn't know it．And that is precisely what beats so many men in Wall Street who are very far from being in the main sucker class．There is the plain fool，who does the wrong thing at all times everywhere，but there is the Wall Street fool，who thinks he must trade all the time．No man can always have adequate reasons for buying or selling stocks daily—or sufficient knowledge to make his play an intelligent play．

I proved it．Whenever I read the tape by the light of experience I made money，but when I made a plain fool play I had to lose．I was no exception，was I？There was the huge quotation board staring me in the face，and the ticker going on，and people trading and watching their tickets turn into cash or into waste paper．Of course I let the craving for excitement get the better of my judgment．In a bucket shop where your margin is a shoestring you don't play for long pulls．You are wiped too easily and quickly．The desire for constant action irrespective of underlying conditions is responsible for many losses in Wall Street even among the professionals，who feel that they must take home some money every day，as though they were working for regular wages．I was only a kid，remember．I did not know then what I learned later，what made me fifteen years later，wait two long weeks and see a stock on which I was very bullish go up thirty points before I felt that it was safe to buy it．I was broke and was trying to get back，and I couldn't afford to play recklessly．I had to be right，and so I waited．That was in 1915．It's a long story．I'll tell it later in its proper place．Now let's go on from where after years of practice at beating them I let the bucket shops take away most of my winnings．

And with my eyes wide open，to boot！And it wasn't the only period of my life when I did it，either．A stock operator has to fight a lot of expensive enemies within himself．Anyhow，I came to New York with twenty-five hundred dollars．There were no bucket shops here that a fellow could trust．The Stock Exchange and the police between them had succeeded in closing them up pretty tight．Besides，I wanted to find a place where the only limit to my trading would be the size of my stake．I didn't have much of one，but I didn't expect it to stay little forever．The main thing at the start was to find a place where I wouldn't have to worry about getting a square deal．So I went to a New York Stock Exchange house that had a branch at home where I knew some of the clerks．They have long since gone out of business．I wasn't there long，didn't like one of the partners，and then I went to A．R．Fullerton & Co．Somebody must have told them about my early experiences，because it was not long before they all got to calling me the Boy Trader．I've always looked young．It was a handicap in some ways but it compelled me to fight for my own because so many tried to take advantage of my youth．The chaps at the bucket shops seeing what a kid I was，always thought I was a fool for luck and that that was the only reason why I beat them so often．

Well，it wasn't six months before I was broke．I was a pretty active trader and had a sort of reputation as a winner．I guess my commissions amounted to something．I ran up my account quite a little，but，of course，in the end I lost．I played carefully；but I had to lose．I'll tell you the reason：it was my remarkable success in the bucket shops！

I could beat the game my way only in a bucket shop；where I was betting on fluctuations．My tape reading had to do with that exclusively．When I bought the price was there on the quotation board，right in front of me．Even before I bought I knew exactly the price I'd have to pay for my stock．And I always could sell on the instant．I could scalp successfully，because I could move like lightning．I could follow up my luck or cut my loss in a second．Sometimes，for instance，I was certain a stock would move at least a point．Well，I didn't have to hog it，I could put up a point margin and double my money in a jiffy；or I'd take half a point．On one or two hundred shares a day，that wouldn't be bad at the end of the month，what？

The practical trouble with that arrangement，of course，was that even if the bucket shop had the resources to stand a big steady loss，they wouldn't do it．They wouldn't have a customer around the place who had the bad taste to win all the time．

At all events，what was a perfect system for trading in bucket shops didn't work in Fullerton's office．There I was actually buying and selling stocks．The price of Sugar on the tape might be 105 and I could see a three-point drop coming．As a matter of fact，at the very moment the ticker was printing 105 on the tape the real price on the floor of the Exchange might be 104 or 103．By the time my order to sell a thousand shares got to Fullerton's floor man to execute，the price might be still lower．I couldn't tell at what price I had put out my thousand shares until I got a report from the clerk．When I surely would have made three thousand on the same transaction in a bucket shop I might not make a cent in a Stock Exchange house．Of course，I have taken an extreme case，but the fact remains that in A．R．Fullerton's office the tape always talked ancient history to me，as far as my system of trading went，and I didn't realise it．

And then，too，if my order was fairly big my own sale would tend further to depress the price．In the bucket shop I didn't have to figure on the effect of my own trading．I lost in New York because the game was altogether different．It was not that I now was playing it legitimately that made me lose，but that I was playing it ignorantly．I have been told that I am a good reader of the tape．But reading the tape like an expert did not save me．I might have made out a great deal better if I had been on the floor myself，a room trader．In a particular crowd perhaps I might have adapted my system to the conditions immediately before me．But，of course，if I had got to operating on such a scale as I do now，for instance，the system would have equally failed me，on account of the effect of my own trading on prices．

In short，I did not know the game of stock speculation．I knew a part of it，a rather important part，which has been very valuable to me at all times．But if with all I had I still lost，what chance does the green outsider have of winning，or，rather，of cashing in？

It didn't take me long to realise that there was something wrong with my play，but I couldn't spot the exact trouble．There were times when my system worked beautifully，and then，all of a sudden，nothing but one swat after another．I was only twenty-two，remember；not that I was so stuck on myself that I didn't want to know just where I was at fault，but that at that age nobody knows much of anything．

The people in the office were very nice to me．I couldn't plunge as I wanted to because of their margin requirements，but old A．R．Fullerton and the rest of the firm were so kind to me that after six months of active trading I not only lost all I had brought and all that I had made there but I even owed the firm a few hundreds．

There I was，a mere kid，who had never before been away from home，flat broke；but I knew there wasn't anything wrong with me；only with my play．I don't know whether I make myself plain，but I never lose my temper over the stock market．I never argue with the tape．Getting sore at the market doesn't get you anywhere．

I was so anxious to resume trading that I didn't lose a minute，but went to old man Fullerton and said to him，“Say，A．R.，lend me five hundred dollars．”

“What for？”says he．

“I've got to have some money．”

“What for？”he says again．

“For margin，of course，”I said．

“Five hundred dollars？”he said，and frowned．“You know they'd expect you to keep up a 10 per cent margin，and that means one thousand dollars on one hundred shares．Much better to give you a credit—”

“No，”I said，“I don't want a credit here．I already owe the firm something．What I want is for you to lend me five hundred dollars so I can go out and get a roll and come back．”

“How are you going to do it？”asked old A．R．

“I'll go and trade in a bucket shop，”I told him．

“Trade here，”he said．

“No，”I said．“I'm not sure yet I can beat the game in this office，but I am sure I can take money out of the bucket shops．I know that game．I have a notion that I know just where I went wrong here．”

He let me have it，and I went out of that office where the Boy Terror of the Bucket Shops，as they called him，had lost his pile．I couldn't go back home because the shops there would not take my business．New York was out of the question；there weren't any doing business at that time．They tell me that in the 90's Broad Street and New Street were full of them．But there weren't any when I needed them in my business．So after some thinking I decided to go to St．Louis．I had heard of two concerns there that did an enormous business all through the Middle West．Their profits must have been huge．They had branch offices in dozens of towns．In fact I had been told that there were no concerns in the East to compare with them for volume of business．They ran openly and the best people traded there without any qualms．A fellow even told me that the owner of one of the concerns was a vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce but that couldn't have been in St．Louis．At any rate，that is where I went with my five hundred dollars to bring back a stake to use as margin in the office of A．R．Fullerton & Co.，members of the New York Stock Exchange．

When I got to St．Louis I went to the hotel，washed up and went out to find the bucket shops．One was the J．G．Dolan Company，and the other was H．S．Teller & Co．I knew I could beat them．I was going to play dead safe—carefully and conservatively．My one fear was that somebody might recognise me and give me away，because the bucket shops all over the country had heard of the Boy Trader．They are like gambling houses and get all the gossip of the profesh．

Dolan was nearer than Teller，and I went there first．I was hoping I might be allowed to do business a few days before they told me to take my trade somewhere else．I walked in．It was a whopping big place and there must have been at least a couple of hundred people there staring at the quotations．I was glad，because in such a crowd I stood a better chance of being unnoticed．I stood and watched the board and looked them over carefully until I picked out the stock for my initial play．

I looked around and saw the order-clerk at the window where you put down your money and get your ticket．He was looking at me so I walked up to him and asked，“Is this where you trade in cotton and wheat？”

“Yes，sonny，”says he．

“Can I buy stocks too？”

“You can if you have the cash，”he said．

“Oh，I got that all right，all right，”I said like a boasting boy．

“You have，have you？”he says with a smile．

“How much stock can I buy for one hundred dollars？”I asked，peeved-like．

“One hundred；if you got the hundred．”

“I got the hundred．Yes；and two hundred too！”I told him．

“Oh，my！”he said．

“Just you buy me two hundred shares，”I said sharply．

“Two hundred what？”he asked，serious now．It was business．

I looked at the board again as if to guess wisely and told him，“Two hundred Omaha．”

“All right！”he said．He took my money，counted it and wrote out the ticket．

“What's your name？”he asked me，and I answered，“Horace Kent．”

He gave me the ticket and I went away and sat down among the customers to wait for the roll to grow．I got quick action and I traded several times that day．On the next day too．In two days I made twenty-eight hundred dollars，and I was hoping they'd let me finish the week out．At the rate I was going，that wouldn't be so bad．Then I'd tackle the other shop，and if I had similar luck there I'd go back to New York with a wad I could do something with．

On the morning of the third day，when I went to the window，bashful-like，to buy five hundred B．R．T．the clerk said to me，“Say，Mr．Kent，the boss wants to see you．”

I knew the game was up．But I asked him，“What does he want to see me about？”

“I don't know．”

“Where is he？”

“In his private office．Go in that way．”And he pointed to a door．

I went in．Dolan was sitting at his desk．He swung around and said，“Sit down，Livingston．”

He pointed to a chair．My last hope vanished．I don't know how he discovered who I was；perhaps from the hotel register．

“What do you want to see me about？”I asked him．

“Listen，kid．I ain't got nothin' agin yeh，see？Nothin' at all．See？”

“No，I don't see，”I said．

He got up from his swivel chair．He was a whopping big guy．He said to me，“Just come over here，Livingston，will yeh？”and he walked to the door．He opened it and then he pointed to the customers in the big room．

“D' yeh see them？”he asked．

“See what？”

“Them guys．Take a look at 'em，kid．There's three hundred of 'em！Three hundred suckers！They feed me and my family．See？Three hundred suckers！Then yeh come in，and in two days yeh cop more than I get out of the three hundred in two weeks．That ain't business，kid—not for me！I ain't got nothin' agin yeh．Yer welcome to what ye've got．But yeh don't get any more．There ain't any here for yeh！”

“Why，I—”

“That's all．I seen yeh come in day before yesterday，and I didn't like yer looks．On the level，I didn't．I spotted yeh for a ringer．I called in that jackass there”—he pointed to the guilty clerk—“and asked what you'd done；and when he told me I said to him：‘I don't like that guy's looks．He's a ringer！’And that piece of cheese says：‘Ringer my eye，boss！His name is Horace Kent，and he's a rah-rah boy playing at being used to long pants．He's all right！’Well，I let him have his way．That blankety-blank cost me twenty-eight hundred dollars．I don't grudge it yeh，my boy．But the safe is locked for yeh．”

“Look here—”I began．

“You look here，Livingston，”he said．“I've heard all about yeh．I make my money coppering suckers' bets，and yeh don't belong here．I aim to be a sport and yer welcome to what yeh pried off 'n us．But more of that would make me a sucker，now that I know who yeh are．So toddle along，sonny！”

I left Dolan's place with my twenty-eight hundred dollars' profit．Teller's place was in the same block．I had found out that Teller was a very rich man who also ran up a lot of pool rooms．I decided to go to his bucket shop．I wondered whether it would be wise to start moderately and work up to a thousand shares or to begin with a plunge，on the theory that I might not be able to trade more than one day．They get wise mighty quick when they're losing and I did want to buy one thousand B．R．T．I was sure I could take four or five points out of it．But if they got suspicious or if too many customers were long of that stock they might not let me trade at all．I thought perhaps I'd better scatter my trades at first and begin small．

It wasn't as big a place as Dolan's，but the fixtures were nicer and evidently the crowd was of a better class．This suited me down to the ground and I decided to buy my one thousand B．R．T．So I stepped up to the proper window and said to the clerk，“I'd like to buy some B．R．T．What's the limit？”

“There's no limit，”said the clerk．“You can buy all you please—if you've got the money．”

“Buy fifteen hundred shares，”I says，and took my roll from my pocket while the clerk starts to write the ticket．

Then I saw a red-headed man just shove that clerk away from the counter．He leaned across and said to me，“Say，Livingston，you go back to Dolan's．We don't want your business．”

“Wait until I get my ticket，”I said．“I just bought a little B．R．T．”

“You get no ticket here，”he said．By this time other clerks had got behind him and were looking at me．“Don't ever come here to trade．We don't take your business．Understand？”

There was no sense in getting mad or trying to argue，so I went back to the hotel，paid my bill and took the first train back to New York．It was tough．I wanted to take back some real money and that Teller wouldn't let me make even one trade．

I got back to New York，paid Fullerton his five hundred，and started trading again with the St．Louis money．I had good and bad spells，but I was doing better than breaking even．After all，I didn't have much to unlearn；only to grasp the one fact that there was more to the game of stock speculation than I had considered before I went to Fullerton's office to trade．I was like one of those puzzle fans，doing the crossword puzzles in the Sunday supplement．He isn't satisfied until he gets it．Well，I certainly wanted to find the solution to my puzzle．I thought I was done with trading in bucket shops．But I was mistaken．

About a couple of months after I got back to New York an old jigger came into Fullerton's office．He knew A．R．Somebody said they'd once owned a string of race horses together．It was plain he'd seen better days．I was introduced to old McDevitt．He was telling the crowd about a bunch of Western race-track crooks who had just pulled off some skin game out in St．Louis．The head devil，he said，was a pool-room owner by the name of Teller．

“What Teller？”I asked him．

“Hi Teller；H．S．Teller．”

“I know that bird，”I said．

“He's no good，”said McDevitt．

“He's worse than that，”I said，“and I have a little matter to settle with him．”

“Meaning how？”

“The only way I can hit any of these short sports is through their pocketbook．I can't touch him in St．Louis just now，but some day I will．”And I told McDevitt my grievance．

“Well，”says old Mac，“he tried to connect here in New York and couldn't make it，so he's opened a place in Hoboken．The word's gone out that there is no limit to the play and that the house roll has got the Rock of Gibraltar faded to the shadow of a bantam flea．”

“What sort of a place？”I thought he meant pool room．

“Bucket shop，”said McDevitt．

“Are you sure it's open？”

“Yes；I've seen several fellows who've told me about it．”

“That's only hearsay，”I said．“Can you find out positively if it's running，and also how heavy they'll really let a man trade？”

“Sure，sonny，”said McDevitt．“I'll go myself tomorrow morning，and come back here and tell you．”

He did．It seems Teller was already doing a big business and would take all he could get．This was on a Friday．The market had been going up all that week—this was twenty years ago，remember—and it was a cinch the bank statement on Saturday would show a big decrease in the surplus reserve．That would give the conventional excuse to the big room traders to jump on the market and try to shake out some of the weak commission-house accounts．There would be the usual reactions in the last half hour of the trading，particularly in stocks in which the public had been the most active．Those，of course，also would be the very stocks that Teller's customers would be most heavily long of，and the shop might be glad to see some short selling in them．There is nothing so nice as catching the suckers both ways；and nothing so easy—with one-point margins．

That Saturday morning I chased over to Hoboken to the Teller place．They had fitted up a big customers' room with a dandy quotation board and a full force of clerks and a special policeman in gray．There were about twenty-five customers．

I got talking to the manager．He asked me what he could do for me and I told him nothing；that a fellow could make much more money at the track on account of the odds and the freedom to bet your whole roll and stand to win thousands in minutes instead of piking for chicken feed in stocks and having to wait days，perhaps．He began to tell me how much safer the stock-market game was，and how much some of their customers made—you'd have sworn it was a regular broker who actually bought and sold your stocks on the Exchange—and how if a man only traded heavy he could make enough to satisfy anybody．He must have thought I was headed for some pool room and he wanted a whack at my roll before the ponies nibbled it away，for he said I ought to hurry up as the market closed at twelve o'clock on Saturdays．That would leave me free to devote the entire afternoon to other pursuits．I might have a bigger roll to carry to the track with me—if I picked the right stocks．

I looked as if I didn't believe him，and he kept on buzzing me．I was watching the clock．At 11：15 I said，“All right，”and I began to give him selling orders in various stocks．I put up two thousand dollars in cash，and he was very glad to get it．He told me he thought I'd make a lot of money and hoped I'd come in often．

It happened just as I figured．The traders hammered the stocks in which they figured they would uncover the most stops，and，sure enough，prices slid off．I closed out my trades just before the rally of the last five minutes on the usual traders' covering．

There was fifty-one hundred dollars coming to me．I went to cash in．

“I am glad I dropped in，”I said to the manager，and gave him my tickets．

“Say，”he says to me，“I can't give you all of it．I wasn't looking for such a run．I'll have it here for you Monday morning，sure as blazes．”

“All right．But first I'll take all you have in the house，”I said．

“You've got to let me pay off the little fellows，”he said．“I'll give you back what you put up，and anything that's left．Wait till I cash the other tickets．”So I waited while he paid off the other winners．Oh，I knew my money was safe．Teller wouldn't welsh with the office doing such a good business．And if he did，what else could I do better than to take all he had then and there？I got my own two thousand dollars and about eight hundred dollars besides，which was all he had in the office．I told him I'd be there Monday morning．He swore the money would be waiting for me．

I got to Hoboken a little before twelve on Monday．I saw a fellow talking to the manager that I had seen in the St．Louis office the day Teller told me to go back to Dolan．I knew at once that the manager had telegraphed to the home office and they'd sent up one of their men to investigate the story．Crooks don't trust anybody．

“I came for the balance of my money，”I said to the manager．

“Is this the man？”asked the St．Louis chap．

“Yes，”said the manager，and took a bunch of yellow backs from his pocket．

“Hold on！”said the St．Louis fellow to him and then turns to me，“Say，Livingston，didn't we tell you we didn't want your business？”

“Give me my money first，”I said to the manager，and he forked over two thousands，four five-hundreds and three hundreds．

“What did you say？”I said to St．Louis．

“We told you we didn't want you to trade in our place．”

“Yes，”I said；“that's why I came．”

“Well，don't come any more．Keep away！”he snarled at me．The private policeman in gray came over，casual-like．St．Louis shook his fist at the manager and yelled：“You ought to've known better，you poor boob，than to let this guy get into you．He's Livingston．You had your orders．”

“Listen，you，”I said to the St．Louis man．“This isn't St．Louis．You can't pull off any trick here，like your boss did with Belfast Boy．”

“You keep away from this office！You can't trade here！”he yells．

“If I can't trade here nobody else is going to，”I told him．“You can't get away with that sort of stuff here．”

Well，St．Louis changed his tune at once．

“Look here，old boy，”he said，all fussed up，“do us a favor．Be reasonable ！You know we can't stand this every day．The old man's going to hit the ceiling when he hears who it was．Have a heart，Livingston ！”

“I'll go easy，”I promised．

“Listen to reason，won't you？For the love of Pete，keep away！Give us a chance to get a good start．We're new here．Will you？”

“I don't want any of this high-and-mighty business the next time I come，”I said，and left him talking to the manager at the rate of a million a minute．I'd got some money out of them for the way they treated me in St．Louis．There wasn't any sense in my getting hot or trying to close them up．I went back to Fullerton's office and told McDevitt what had happened．Then I told him that if it was agreeable to him I'd like to have him go to Teller's place and begin trading in twenty or thirty share lots，to get them used to him．Then，the moment I saw a good chance to clean up big，I'd telephone him and he could plunge．

I gave McDevitt a thousand dollars and he went to Hoboken and did as I told him．He got to be one of the regulars．Then one day when I thought I saw a break impending I slipped Mac the word and he sold all they'd let him．I cleared twenty-eight hundred dollars that day，after giving Mac his rake-off and paying expenses，and I suspect Mac put down a little bet of his own besides．Less than a month after that，Teller closed his Hoboken branch．The police got busy．And，anyhow，it didn't pay，though I only traded there twice．We ran into a crazy bull market when stocks didn't react enough to wipe out even the one-point margins，and，of course，all the customers were bulls and winning and pyramiding．No end of bucket shops busted all over the country．

Their game has changed．Trading in the old-fashioned bucket shop had some decided advantages over speculating in a reputable broker's office．For one thing，the automatic closing out of your trade when the margin reached the exhaustion point was the best kind of stop-loss order．You couldn't get stung for more than you had put up，and there was no danger of rotten execution of orders，and so on．In New York the shops never were as liberal with their patrons as I've heard they were in the West．Here they used to limit the possible profit on certain stocks of the football order to two points．Sugar and Tennessee Coal and Iron were among these．No matter if they moved ten points in ten minutes you could only make two on one ticket．They figured that otherwise the customer was getting too big odds；he stood to lose one dollar and to make ten．And then there were times when all the shops，including the biggest，refused to take orders on certain stocks．In 1900，on the day before Election Day，when it was a foregone conclusion that McKinley would win，not a shop in the land let its customers buy stocks．The election odds were 3 to 1 on McKinley．By buying stocks on Monday you stood to make from three to six points or more．A man could bet on Bryan and buy stocks and make sure money．The bucket shops refused orders that day．

If it hadn't been for their refusing to take my business I never would have stopped trading in them．And then I never would have learned that there was much more to the game of stock speculation than to play for fluctuations of a few points．





Chapter III


It takes a man a long time to learn all the lessons of all his mistakes．They say there are two sides to everything．But there is only one side to the stock market；and it is not the bull side or the bear side，but the right side．It took me longer to get that general principle fixed firmly in my mind than it did most of the more technical phases of the game of stock speculation．

I have heard of people who amuse themselves conducting imaginary operations in the stock market to prove with imaginary dollars how right they are．Sometimes these ghost gamblers make millions．It is very easy to be a plunger that way．It is like the old story of the man who was going to fight a duel the next day．

His second asked him，“Are you a good shot？”

“Well，”said the duelist，“I can snap the stem of a wineglass at twenty paces，”and he looked modest．

“That's all very well，”said the unimpressed second．“But can you snap the stem of the wineglass while the wineglass is pointing a loaded pistol straight at your heart？”

With me I must back my opinions with my money．My losses have taught me that I must not begin to advance until I am sure I shall not have to retreat．But if I cannot advance I do not move at all．I do not mean by this that a man should not limit his losses when he is wrong．He should．But that should not breed indecision．All my life I have made mistakes，but in losing money I have gained experience and accumulated a lot of valuable don'ts．I have been flat broke several times，but my loss has never been a total loss．Otherwise，I wouldn't be here now．I always knew I would have another chance and that I would not make the same mistake a second time．I believed in myself．

A man must believe in himself and his judgment if he expects to make a living at this game．That is why I don't believe in tips．If I buy stocks on Smith's tip I must sell those same stocks on Smith's tip．I am depending on him．Suppose Smith is away on a holiday when the selling time comes around？No，sir，nobody can make big money on what someone else tells him to do．I know from experience that nobody can give me a tip or a series of tips that will make more money for me than my own judgment．It took me five years to learn to play the game intelligently enough to make big money when I was right．

I didn't have as many interesting experiences as you might imagine．I mean，the process of learning how to speculate does not seem very dramatic at this distance．I went broke several times，and that is never pleasant，but the way I lost money is the way everybody loses money who loses money in Wall Street．Speculation is a hard and trying business，and a speculator must be on the job all the time or he'll soon have no job to be on．

My task，as I should have known after my early reverses at Fullerton's，was very simple：To look at speculation from another angle．But I didn't know that there was much more to the game than I could possibly learn in the bucket shops．There I thought I was beating the game when in reality I was only beating the shop．At the same time the tape-reading ability that trading in bucket shops developed in me and the training of my memory have been extremely valuable．Both of these things came easy to me．I owe my early success as a trader to them and not to brains or knowledge，because my mind was untrained and my ignorance was colossal．The game taught me the game．And it didn't spare the rod while teaching．

I remember my very first day in New York．I told you how the bucket shops，by refusing to take my business，drove me to seek a reputable commission house．One of the boys in the office where I got my first job was working for Harding Brothers，members of the New York Stock Exchange．I arrived in this city in the morning，and before one o'clock that same day I had opened an account with the firm and was ready to trade．

I didn't explain to you how natural it was for me to trade there exactly as I had done in the bucket shops，where all I did was to bet on fluctuations and catch small but sure changes in prices．Nobody offered to point out the essential differences or set me right．If somebody had told me my method would not work I nevertheless would have tried it out to make sure for myself，for when I am wrong only one thing convinces me of it，and that is，to lose money．And I am only right when I make money．That is speculating．

They were having some pretty lively times those days and the market was very active．That always cheers up a fellow．I felt at home right away．There was the old familiar quotation board in front of me，talking a language that I had learned before I was fifteen years old．There was a boy doing exactly the same thing I used to do in the first office I ever worked in．There were the customers—same old bunch—looking at the board or standing by the ticket calling out the prices and talking about the market．The machinery was to all appearances the same machinery that I was used to．The atmosphere was the atmosphere I had breathed since I had made my first stock-market money—$3.12 in Burlington．The same kind of ticker and the same kind of traders，therefore the same kind of game．And remember，I was only twenty-two．I suppose I thought I knew the game from A to Z．Why shouldn't I？

I watched the board and saw something that looked good to me．It was behaving right．I bought a hundred at 84．I got out at 85 in less than a half hour．Then I saw something else I liked，and I did the same thing；took three-quarters of a point net within a very short time．I began well，didn't I？

Now mark this：On that，my first day as a customer of a reputable Stock Exchange house，and only two hours of it at that，I traded in eleven hundred shares of stock，jumping in and out．And the net result of the day's operations was that I lost exactly eleven hundred dollars．That is to say，on my first attempt，nearly one-half of my stake went up the flue．And remember，some of the trades showed me a profit．But I quit eleven hundred dollars minus for the day．

It didn't worry me，because I couldn't see where there was anything wrong with me．My moves，also，were right enough，and if I had been trading in the old Cosmopolitan shop I'd have broken better than even．That the machine wasn't as it ought to be，my eleven hundred vanished dollars plainly told me．But as long as the machinist was all right there was no need to stew．Ignorance at twenty-two isn't a structural defect．

After a few days I said to myself，“I can't trade this way here．The ticker doesn't help as it should！”But I let it go at that without getting down to bed rock．I kept it up，having good days and bad days，until I was cleaned out．I went to old Fullerton and got him to stake me to five hundred dollars．And I came back from St．Louis，as I told you，with money I took out of the bucket shops there—a game I could always beat．

I played more carefully and did better for a while．As soon as I was in easy circumstances I began to live pretty well．I made friends and had a good time．I was not quite twenty-three，remember；all alone in New York with easy money in my pockets and the belief in my heart that I was beginning to understand the new machine．

I was making allowances for the actual execution of my orders on the floor of the Exchange，and moving more cautiously．But I was still sticking to the tape—that is，I was still ignoring general principles；and as long as I did that I could not spot the exact trouble with my game．

We ran into the big boom of 1901 and I made a great deal of money—that is，for a boy．You remember those times？The prosperity of the country was unprecedented．We not only ran into an era of industrial consolidations and combinations of capital that beat anything we had had up to that time，but the public went stock mad．In previous flush times，I have heard，Wall Street used to brag of two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-share days，when securities of a par value of twenty-five million dollars changed hands．But in 1901 we had a three-million-share day．Everybody was making money．The steel crowd came to town，a horde of millionaires with no more regard for money than drunken sailors．The only game that satisfied them was the stock market．We had some of the biggest high rollers the Street ever saw：John W．Gates，of‘Bet-you-a-million' fame，and his friends，like John A．Drake，Loyal Smith，and the rest；the Reid-Leeds-Moore crowd，who sold part of their Steel holdings and with the proceeds bought in the open market the actual majority of the stock of the great Rock Island system；and Schwab and Frick and Phipps and the Pittsburgh coterie；to say nothing of scores of men who were lost in the shuffle but would have been called great plungers at any other time．A fellow could buy and sell all the stock there was．Keene made a market for the U．S．Steel shares．A broker sold one hundred thousand shares in a few minutes．A wonderful time！And there were some wonderful winnings．And no taxes to pay on stock sales！And no day of reckoning in sight．

Of course，after a while，I heard a lot of calamity howling and the old stagers said everybody—except themselves—had gone crazy，But everybody except themselves was making money．I knew，of course，there must be a limit to the advances and an end to the crazy buying of A．O．T．—Any Old Thing—and I got bearish．But every time I sold I lost money，and if it hadn't been that I ran darn quick I'd have lost a heap more．I looked for a break，but I was playing safe—making money when I bought and chipping it out when I sold short—so that I wasn't profiting by the boom as much as you'd think when you consider how heavily I used to trade，even as a boy．

There was one stock that I wasn't short of，and that was Northern Pacific．My tape reading came in handy．I thought most stocks had been bought to a standstill，but Little Nipper behaved as if it were going still higher．We know now that both the common and the preferred were being steadily absorbed by the Kuhn-Loeb-Harriman combination．Well，I was long a thousand shares of Northern Pacific common，and held it against the advice of everybody in the office．When it got to about 110 I had thirty points profit，and I grabbed it．It made my balance at my brokers' nearly fifty thousand dollars，the greatest amount of money I had been able to accumulate up to that time．It wasn't so bad for a chap who had lost every cent trading in that selfsame office a few months before．

If you remember，the Harriman crowd notified Morgan and Hill of their intention to be represented in the Burlington-Great Northern-Northern Pacific combination，and then the Morgan people at first instructed Keene to buy fifty thousand shares of N．P．to keep the control in their possession．I have heard that Keene told Robert Bacon to make the order one hundred and fifty thousand shares and the bankers did．At all events，Keene sent one of his brokers，Eddie Norton，into the N．P，crowd and he bought one hundred thousand shares of the stock．This was followed by another order，I think，of fifty thousand shares additional，and the famous corner followed．After the market closed on May 8，1901，the whole world knew that a battle of financial giants was on．No two such combinations of capital had ever opposed each other in this country．Harriman against Morgan；an irresistible force meeting an immovable object．

There I was on the morning of May ninth with nearly fifty thousand dollars in cash and no stocks．As I told you，I had been very bearish for some days，and here was my chance at last．I knew what would happen—an awful break and then some wonderful bargains．There would be a quick recovery and big profits—for those who had picked up the bargains．It didn't take a Sherlock Holmes to figure this out．We were going to have an opportunity to catch them coming and going，not only for big money but for sure money．

Everything happened as I had foreseen．I was dead right and—I lost every cent I had！I was wiped out by something that was unusual．If the unusual never happened there would be no difference in people and then there wouldn't be any fun in life．The game would become merely a matter of addition and subtraction．It would make of us a race of bookkeepers with plodding minds．It's the guessing that develops a man's brain power．Just consider what you have to do to guess right．

The market fairly boiled，as I had expected．The transactions were enormous and the fluctuations unprecedented in extent．I put in a lot of selling orders at the market．When I saw the opening prices I had a fit，the breaks were so awful．My brokers were on the job．They were as competent and conscientious as any；but by the time they executed my orders the stocks had broken twenty points more．The tape was way behind the market and reports were slow in coming in by reason of the awful rush of business．When I found out that the stocks I had ordered sold when the tape said the price was，say，100 and they got mine off at 80，making a total decline of thirty or forty points from the previous night's close，it seemed to me that I was putting out shorts at a level that made the stocks I sold the very bargains I had planned to buy．The market was not going to drop right through to China．So I decided instantly to cover my shorts and go long．

My brokers bought；not at the level that had made me turn，but at the prices prevailing in the Stock Exchange when their floor man got my orders．They paid an average of fifteen points more than I had figured on．A loss of thirty-five points in one day was more than anybody could stand．

The ticker beat me by lagging so far behind the market．I was accustomed to regarding the tape as the best little friend I had because I bet according to what it told me．But this time the tape double-crossed me．The divergence between the printed and the actual prices undid me．It was the sublimation of my previous unsuccess，the selfsame thing that had beaten me before．It seems so obvious now that tape reading is not enough，irrespective of the brokers' execution，that I wonder why I didn't then see both my trouble and the remedy for it．

I did worse than not see it；I kept on trading，in and out，regardless of the execution．You see，I never could trade with a limit．I must take my chances with the market．That is what I am trying to beat—the market，not the particular price．When I think I should sell，I sell．When I think stocks will go up，I buy．My adherence to that general principle of speculation saved me．To have traded at limited prices simply would have been my old bucket-shop method inefficiently adapted for use in a reputable commission broker's office．I would never have learned to know what stock speculation is，but would have kept on betting on what a limited experience told me was a sure thing．

Whenever I did try to limit the prices in order to minimize the disadvantages of trading at the market when the ticker lagged，I simply found that the market got away from me．This happened so often that I stopped trying．I can't tell you how it came to take me so many years to learn that instead of placing piking bets on what the next few quotations were going to be，my game was to anticipate what was going to happen in a big way．

After my May ninth mishap I plugged along，using a modified but still defective method．If I hadn't made money some of the time I might have acquired market wisdom quicker．But I was making enough to enable me to live well．I liked friends and a good time．I was living down the Jersey Coast that summer，like hundreds of prosperous Wall Street men．My winnings were not quite enough to offset both my losses and my living expenses．

I didn't keep on trading the way I did through stubbornness．I simply wasn't able to state my own problem to myself，and，of course，it was utterly hopeless to try to solve it．I harp on this topic so much to show what I had to go through before I got to where I could really make money．My old shotgun and BB shot could not do the work of a high-power repeating rifle against big game．

Early that fall I not only was cleaned out again but I was so sick of the game I could no longer beat that I decided to leave New York and try something else some other place．I had been trading since my fourteenth year．I had made my first thousand dollars when I was a kid of fifteen，and my first ten thousand before I was twenty-one．I had made and lost a ten-thousand-dollar stake more than once．In New York I had made thousands and lost them．I got up to fifty thousand dollars and two days later that went．I had no other business and knew no other game．After several years I was back where I began．No—worse，for I had acquired habits and a style of living that required money；though that part didn't bother me as much as being wrong so consistently．





Chapter IV


WELL，I went home．But the moment I was back I knew that I had but one mission in life and that was to get a stake and go back to Wall Street．That was the only place in the country where I could trade heavily．Some day，when my game was all right，I'd need such a place．When a man is right he wants to get all that is coming to him for being right．

I didn't have much hope，but，of course，I tried to get into the bucket shops again．There were fewer of them and some of them were run by strangers．Those who remembered me wouldn't give me a chance to show them whether I had gone back as a trader or not．I told them the truth，that I had lost in New York whatever I had made at home；that I didn't know as much as I used to think I did；and that there was no reason why it should not now be good business for them to let me trade with them．But they wouldn't．And the new places were unreliable．Their owners thought twenty shares was as much as a gentleman ought to buy if he had any reason to suspect he was going to guess right．

I needed the money and the bigger shops were taking in plenty of it from their regular customers．I got a friend of mine to go into a certain office and trade．I just sauntered in to look them over．I again tried to coax the order clerk to accept a small order，even if it was only fifty shares．Of course he said no．I had rigged up a code with this friend so that he would buy or sell when and what I told him．But that only made me chicken feed．Then the office began to grumble about taking my friend's orders．Finally one day he tried to sell a hundred St．Paul and they shut down on him．

We learned afterward that one of the customers saw us talking together outside and went in and told the office，and when my friend went up to the order clerk to sell that hundred St．Paul the guy said：

“We're not taking any selling orders in St．Paul，not from you．”

“Why，what's the matter，Joe？”asked my friend．

“Nothing doing，that's all，”answered Joe．

“Isn't that money any good？Look it over．It's all there．”And my friend passed over the hundred—my hundred—in tens．He tried to look indignant and I was looking unconcerned；but most of the other customers were getting close to the combatants，as they always did when there was loud talking or the slightest semblance of a scrap between the shop and any customer．They wanted to get a line on the merits of the case in order to get a line on the solvency of the concern．

The clerk，Joe，who was a sort of assistant manager，came out from behind his cage，walked up to my friend，looked at him and then looked at me．

“It's funny，”he said slowly—“it's damned funny that you never do a single thing here when your friend Livingston isn't around．You just sit and look at the board by the hour．Never a peep．But after he comes in you get busy all of a sudden．Maybe you are acting for yourself；but not in this office any more．We don't fall for Livingston tipping you off．”

Well，that stopped my board money．But I had made a few hundred more than I had spent and I wondered how I could use them，for the need of making enough money to go back to New York with was more urgent than ever．I felt that I would do better the next time．I had had time to think calmly of some of my foolish plays；and then，one can see the whole better when one sees it from a little distance．The immediate problem was to make the new stake．

One day I was in a hotel lobby，talking to some fellows I knew，who were pretty steady traders．Everybody was talking stock market．I made the remark that nobody could beat the game on account of the rotten execution he got from his brokers，especially when he traded at the market，as I did．

A fellow piped up and asked me what particular brokers I meant．

I said，“The best in the land，”and he asked who might they be．I could see he wasn't going to believe I ever dealt with first-class houses．

But I said，“I mean，any member of the New York Stock Exchange．It isn't that they are crooked or careless，but when a man gives an order to buy at the market he never knows what that stock is going to cost him until he gets a report from the brokers．There are more moves of one or two points than of ten or fifteen．But the outside trader can't catch the small rises or drops because of the execution．I'd rather trade in a bucket shop any day in the week，if they'd only let a fellow trade big．”

The man who had spoken to me I had never seen before．His name was Roberts．He seemed very friendly disposed．He took me aside and asked me if I had ever traded in any of the other exchanges，and I sand no．He said he knew some houses that were members of the Cotton Exchange and the Produce Exchange and the smaller stock exchanges．These firms were very careful and paid special attention to the execution．He said that they had confidential connections with the biggest and smartest houses on the New York Stock Exchange and through their personal pull and by guaranteeing a business of hundreds of thousands of shares a month they got much better service than an individual customer could get．

“They really cater to the small customer，”he said．“They make a specialty of out-of-town business and they take just as much pains with a ten-share order as they do with one for ten thousand．They are very competent and honest．”

“Yes．But if they pay the Stock Exchange house the regular eighth commission，where do they come in？”

“Well，they are supposed to pay the eighth．But—you know！”He winked at me．

“Yes，”I said．“But the one thing a Stock Exchange firm will not do is to split commissions．The governors would rather a member committed murder，arson and bigamy than to do business for outsiders for less than a kosher eighth．The very life of the Stock Exchange depends upon their not violating that one rule．”

He must have seen that I had talked with Stock Exchange people，for he said，“Listen！Every now and then one of those pious Stock Exchange houses is suspended for a year for violating that rule，isn't it？There are ways and ways of rebating so nobody can squeal．”He probably saw unbelief in my face，for he went on：“And besides，on certain kind of business we—I mean，these wire houses—charge a thirty-second extra，in addition to the eighth commission．They are very nice about it．They never charge the extra commission except in unusual cases，and then only if the customer has an inactive account．It wouldn't pay them，you know，otherwise．They aren't in business exclusively for their health．”

By that time I knew he was touting for some phony brokers．

“Do you know any reliable house of that kind？”I asked him．

“I know the biggest brokerage firm in the United States，”he said．“I trade there myself．They have branches in seventy-eight cities in the United States and Canada．They do an enormous business．And they couldn't very well do it year in and year out if they weren't strictly on the level，could they？”

“Certainly not，”I agreed．“Do they trade in the same stocks that are dealt in on the New York Stock Exchange？”

“Of course；and on the curb and on any other exchange in this country，or Europe．They deal in wheat，cotton，provisions；anything you want．They have correspondents everywhere and memberships in all the exchanges，either in their own name or on the quiet．”

I knew by that time，but I thought I'd lead him on．

“Yes，”I said，“but that does not alter the fact that the orders have to be executed by somebody，and nobody living can guarantee how the market will be or how close the ticker's prices are to the actual prices on the floor of the Exchange．By the time a man gets the quotation here and he hands in an order and it's telegraphed to New York，some valuable time has gone．I might better go back to New York and lose my money there in respectable company．”

“I don't know anything about losing money；our customers don't acquire that habit．They make money．We take care of that．”

“Your customers？”

“Well，I take an interest in the firm，and if I can turn some business their way I do so because they've always treated me white and I've made a good deal of money through them．If you wish I'll introduce you to the manager．”

“What's the name of the firm？”I asked him．

He told me．I had heard about them．They ran ads in all the papers，calling attention to the great profits made by those customers who followed their inside information on active stocks．That was the firm's great specialty．They were not a regular bucket shop，but bucketeers，alleged brokers who bucketed their orders but nevertheless went through an elaborate camouflage to convince the world that they were regular brokers engaged in a legitimate business．They were one of the oldest of that class of firms．

They were the prototype at that time of the same sort of brokers that went broke this year by the dozen．The general principles and methods were the same，though the particular devices for fleecing the public differed somewhat，certain details having been changed when the old tricks became too well known．

These people used to send out tips to buy or sell a certain stock—hundreds of telegrams advising the instant purchase of a certain stock and hundreds recommending other customers to sell the same stock，on the old racing-tipster plan．Then orders to buy and sell would come in．The firm would buy and sell，say，a thousand of that stock through a reputable Stock Exchange firm and get a regular report on it．This report they would show to any doubting Thomas who was impolite enough to speak about bucketing customers' orders．

They also used to form discretionary pools in the office and as a great favor allowed their customers to authorize them，in writing，to trade with the customer's money and in the customer's name，as they in their judgment deemed best．That way the most cantankerous customer had no legal redress when his money disappeared．They'd bull a stock，on paper，and put the customers in and then they'd execute one of the old-fashioned bucket-shop drives and wipe out hundreds of shoestring margins．They did not spare anyone，women，schoolteachers and old men being their best bet．

“I'm sore on all brokers，”I told the tout．“I'll have to think this over，”and I left him so he wouldn't talk any more to me．

I inquired about this firm．I learned that they had hundreds of customers and although there were the usual stories I did not find any case of a customer not getting his money from them if he won any．The difficulty was in finding anybody who had ever won in that office；but I did．Things seemed to be going their way just then，and that meant that they probably would not welsh if a trade went against them．Of course most concerns of that kind eventually go broke．There are times when there are regular epidemics of bucketeering bankruptcies，like the old-fashioned runs on several banks after one of them goes up．The customers of the others get frightened and they run to take their money out．But there are plenty of retired bucket-shop keepers in this country．

Well，I heard nothing alarming about the tout's firm except that they were on the make，first，last and all the time，and that they were not always truthful．Their specialty was trimming suckers who wanted to get rich quick．But they always asked their customers' permission，in writing，to take their rolls away from them．

One chap I met did tell me a story about seeing six hundred telegrams go out one day advising customers to get aboard a certain stock and six hundred telegrams to other customers strongly urging them to sell that same stock，at once．

“Yes，I know the trick，”I said to the chap who was telling me．

“Yes，”he said．“But the next day they sent telegrams to the same people advising them to close out their interest in everything and buy—or sell—another stock．I asked the senior partner，who was in the office，‘Why do you do that？The first part I understand．Some of your customers are bound to make money on paper for a while，even if they and the others eventually lose．But by sending out telegrams like this you simply kill them all．What's the big idea？’”

“‘Well，’he said，‘the customers are bound to lose their money anyhow，no matter what they buy，or how or where or when．When they lose their money I lose the customers．Well，I might as well get as much of their money as I can—and then look for a new crop．’”

Well，I admit frankly that I wasn't concerned with the business ethics of the firm．I told you I felt sore on the Teller concern and how it tickled me to get even with them．But I didn't have any such feeling about this firm．They might be crooks or they might not be as black as they were painted．I did not propose to let them do any trading for me，or follow their tips or believe their lies．My one concern was with getting together a stake and returning to New York to trade in fair amounts in an office where you did not have to be afraid the police would raid the joint，as they did the bucket shops，or see the postal authorities swoop down and tie up your money so that you'd be lucky to get eight cents on the dollar a year and a half later．

Anyhow，I made up my mind that I would see what trading advantages of this firm offered over what you might call the legitimate brokers．I didn't have much money to put up as margin，and firms that bucketed orders were naturally much more liberal in that respect，so that a few hundred dollars went much further in their offices．

I went down to their place and had a talk with the manager himself．When he found out that I was an old trader and had formerly had accounts in New York with Stock Exchange houses and that I had lost all I took with me he stopped promising to make a million a minute for me if I let them invest my savings．He figured that I was a permanent sucker，the ticker-hound kind that always plays and always loses；a steady-income provider for brokers，whether they were the kind that bucket your orders or modestly content themselves with the commissions．

I just told the manager that what I was looking for was decent execution，because I always traded at the market and I didn't want to get reports that showed a difference of a half or a whole point from the ticker price．

He assured me on his word of honor that they would do whatever I thought was right．They wanted my business because they wanted to show me what high-class brokering was．They had in their employ the best talent in the business．In fact，they were famous for their execution．If there was any difference between the ticker price and the report it was always in favor of the customer，though of course they didn't guarantee that．If I opened an account with them I could buy and sell at the price which came over the wire，they were so confident of their brokers．

Naturally that meant that I could trade there to all intents and purposes as though I were in a bucket shop—that is，they'd let me trade at the next quotation．I didn't want to appear too anxious，so I shook my head and told him I guessed I wouldn't open an account that day，but I'd let him know．He urged me strongly to begin right away as it was a good market to make money in．It was—for them；a dull market with prices seesawing slightly，just the kind to get customers in and then wipe them out with a sharp drive in the tipped stock．I had some trouble in getting away．

I had given him my name and address，and that very same day I began to get prepaid telegrams and letters urging me to get aboard of some stock or other in which they said they knew an inside pool was operating for a fifty-point rise．

I was busy going around and finding out all I could about several other brokerage concerns of the same bucketing kind．It seemed to me that if I could be sure of getting my winnings out of their clutches the only way of my getting together some real money was to trade in these near bucket-shops．

When I had learned all I could I opened accounts with three firms．I had taken a small office and had direct wires run to the three brokers．

I traded in a small way so they wouldn't get frightened off at the very start．I made money on balance and they were not slow in telling me that they expected real business from customers who had direct wires to their offices．They did not hanker for pikers．They figured that the more I did the more I'd lose，and the more quickly I was wiped out the more they'd make．It was a sound enough theory when you consider that these people necessarily dealt with averages and the average customer was never long-lived，financially speaking．A busted customer can't trade．A half-crippled customer can whine and insinuate things and make trouble of one or another kind that hurts business．

I also established a connection with a local firm that had a direct wire to its New York correspondent，who were also members of the New York Stock Exchange．I had a stock ticker put in and I began to trade conservatively．As I told you，it was pretty much like trading in bucket shops，only it was a little slower．

It was a game that I could beat，and I did．I never got it down to such a fine point that I could win ten times out of ten；but I won on balance，taking it week in and week out．I was again living pretty well，but always saving something，to increase the stake that I was to take back to Wall Street．I got a couple of wires into two more of these bucketing brokerage houses，making five in all—and，of course，my good firm．

There were times when my plans went wrong and my stocks did not run true to form，but did the opposite of what they should have done if they had kept up their regard for precedent．But they did not hit me very hard—they couldn't，with my shoestring margins．My relations with my brokers were friendly enough．Their accounts and records did not always agree with mine，and the differences uniformly happened to be against me．Curious coincidence—not！But I fought for my own and usually had my way in the end．They always had the hope of getting away from me what I had taken from them．They regarded my winnings as temporary loans，I think．

They really were not sporty，being in the business to make money by hook or by crook instead of being content with the house percentage．Since suckers always lose money when they gamble in stocks—they never really speculate—you'd think these fellows would run what you might call a legitimate illegitimate business．But they didn't．“Copper your customers and grow rich”is an old and true adage，but they did not seem ever to have heard of it and didn't stop at plain bucketing．

Several times they tried to double-cross me with the old tricks．They caught me a couple of times because I wasn't looking．They always did that when I had taken no more than my usual line．I accused them of being short sports or worse，but they denied it and it ended by my going back to trading as usual．The beauty of doing business with a crook is that he always forgives you for catching him，so long as you don't stop doing business with him．It's all right as far as he is concerned．He is willing to meet you more than halfway．Magnanimous souls！

Well，I made up my mind that I couldn't afford to have the normal rate of increase of my stake impaired by crooks' tricks，so I decided to teach them a lesson．I picked out some stock that after having been a speculative favorite had become inactive．Water-logged．If I had taken one that never had been active they would have suspected my play．I gave out buying orders on this stock to my five bucketeering brokers．When the orders were taken and they were waiting for the next quotation to come out on the tape，I sent in an order through my Stock Exchange house to sell a hundred shares of that particular stock at the market．I urgently asked for quick action．Well，you can imagine what happened when the selling order got to the floor of the Exchange；a dull inactive stock that a commission house with out-of-town connections wanted to sell in a hurry．Somebody got cheap stock．But the transaction as it would be printed on the tape was the price that I would pay on my five buying orders．I was long on balance four hundred shares of that stock at a low figure．The wire house asked me what I'd heard，and I said I had a tip on it．Just before the close of the market I sent an order to my reputable house to buy back that hundred shares，and not waste any time；that I didn't want to be short under any circumstances；and I didn't care what they paid．So they wired to New York and the order to buy that hundred quick resulted in a sharp advance．I of course had put in selling orders for the five hundred shares that my friends had bucketed．It worked very satisfactorily．

Still，they didn't mend their ways，and so I worked that trick on them several times．I did not dare punish them as severely as they deserved，seldom more than a point or two on a hundred shares．But it helped to swell my little hoard that I was saving for my next Wall Street venture．I sometimes varied the process by selling some stock short，without overdoing it．I was satisfied with my six or eight hundred clear for each crack．

One day the stunt worked so well that it went far beyond all calculations for a ten-point swing．I wasn't looking for it．As a matter of fact it so happened that I had two hundred shares instead of my usual hundred at one broker's，though only a hundred in the four other shops．That was too much of a good thing—for them．They were sore as pups about it and they began to say things over the wires．So I went and saw the manager，the same man who had been so anxious to get my account，and so forgiving every time I caught him trying to put something over on me．He talked pretty big for a man in his position．

“That was a fictitious market for that stock，and we won't pay you a damned cent！”he swore．

“It wasn't a fictitious market when you accepted my order to buy．You let me in then，all right，and now you've got to let me out．You can't get around that for fairness，can you？”

“Yes，I can！”he yelled．“I can prove that somebody put up a job．”

“Who put up a job？”I asked．

“Somebody！”

“Who did they put it up on？”I asked．

“Some friends of yours were in it as sure as pop，”he said．

But I told him，“You know very well that I play a lone hand．Everybody in this town knows that．They've known it ever since I started trading in stocks．Now I want to give you some friendly advice：you just send and get that money for me．I don't want to be disagreeable．Just do what I tell you．”

“I won't pay it．It was a rigged-up transaction，”he yelled．

I got tired of his talk．So I told him：“You'll pay it to me right now and here．”

Well，he blustered a little more and accused me flatly of being the guilty thimblerigger；but he finally forked over the cash．The others were not so rambunctious．In one office the manager had been studying these inactive-stock plays of mine and when he got my order he actually bought the stock for me and then some for himself in the Little Board，and he made some money．These fellows didn't mind being sued by customers on charges of fraud，as they generally had a good technical legal defense ready．But they were afraid I'd attach the furniture—the money in the bank was not available because they took care not to have any funds exposed to that danger．It would not hurt them to be known as pretty sharp，but to get a reputation for welshing was fatal．For a customer to lose money at his broker's is no rare event．But for a customer to make money and then not get it is the worst crime on the speculators' statute books．

I got my money from all；but that ten-point jump put an end to the pleasing pastime of skinning skinners．They were on the lookout for the little trick that they themselves had used to defraud hundreds of poor customers．I went back to my regular trading；but the market wasn't always right for my system—that is，limited as I was by the size of the orders they would take，I couldn't make a killing．

I had been at it over a year，during which I used every device that I could think of to make money trading in those wire houses．I had lived very comfortably，bought an automobile and didn't limit myself about my expenses．I had to make a stake，but I also had to live while I was doing it．If my position on the market was right I couldn't spend as much as I made，so that I'd always be saving some．If I was wrong I didn't make any money and therefore couldn't spend．As I said，I had saved up a fair-sized roll，and there wasn't so much money to be made in the five wire houses；so I decided to return to New York．

I had my own automobile and I invited a friend of mine who also was a trader to motor to New York with me．He accepted and we started．We stopped at New Haven for dinner．At the hotel I met an old trading acquaintance，and among other things he told me there was a shop in town that had a wire and was doing a pretty good business．

We left the hotel on our way to New York，but I drove by the street where the bucket shop was to see what the outside looked like．We found it and couldn't resist the temptation to stop and have a look at the inside．It wasn't very sumptuous，but the old blackboard was there，and the customers，and the game was on．

The manager was a chap who looked as if he had been an actor or a stump speaker．He was very impressive．He'd say good morning as though he had discovered the morning's goodness after ten years of searching for it with a microscope and was making you a present of the discovery as well as of the sky，the sun and the firm's bank roll．He saw us come up in the sporty-looking automobile，and as both of us were young and careless—I don't suppose I looked twenty—he naturally concluded we were a couple of Yale boys．I didn't tell him we weren't．He didn't give me a chance，but began delivering a speech．He was very glad to see us．Would we have a comfortable seat？The market，we would find，was philanthropically inclined that morning；in fact，clamoring to increase the supply of collegiate pocket money，of which no intelligent undergraduate ever had a sufficiency since the dawn of historic time．But here and now，by the beneficence of the ticker，a small initial investment would return thousands．More pocket money than anybody could spend was what the stock market yearned to yield．

Well，I thought it would be a pity not to do as the nice man of the bucket shop was so anxious to have us do，so I told him I would do as he wished，because I had heard that lots of people made lots of money in the stock market．

I began to trade，very conservatively，but increasing the line as I won．My friend followed me．

We stayed overnight in New Haven and the next morning found us at the hospitable shop at five minutes to ten．The orator was glad to see us，thinking his turn would come that day．But I cleaned up within a few dollars of fifteen hundred．The next morning when we dropped in on the great orator，and handed him an order to sell five hundred Sugar he hesitated，but finally accepted it—in silence！The stock broke over a point and I closed out and gave him the ticket．There was exactly five hundred dollars coming to me in profits，and my five hundred dollar margin．He took twenty fifties from the safe，counted them three times very slowly，then he counted them again in front of me．It looked as if his fingers were sweating mucilage the way the notes seemed to stick to him，but finally he handed the money to me．He folded his arms，bit his lower lip，kept it bit，and stared at the top of a window behind me．

I told him I'd like to sell two hundred Steel．But he never stirred．He didn't hear me．I repeated my wish，only I made it three hundred shares．He turned his head．I waited for the speech．But all he did was to look at me．Then he smacked his lips and swallowed—as if he was going to start an attack on fifty years of political misrule by the unspeakable grafters of the opposition．

Finally he waved his hand toward the yellow-backs in my hand and said，“Take away that bauble！”

“Take away what？”I said．I hadn't quite understood what he was driving at．

“Where are you going，student？”He spoke very impressively．

“New York，”I told him．

“That's right，”he said，nodding about twenty times．“That is exactly right．You are going away from here all right，because now I know two things—two，student！I know what you are not，and I know what you are．Yes！Yes！Yes！”

“Is that so？”I said very politely．

“Yes．You two—”He paused；and then he stopped being in Congress and snarled：“You two are the biggest sharks in the United States of America！Students？Ye-eh！You must be freshmen Ye-eh！”

We left him talking to himself．He probably didn't mind the money so much．No professional gambler does．It's all in the game and the luck's bound to turn．It was his being fooled in us that hurt his pride．

That is how I came back to Wall Street for a third attempt．I had been studying，of course，trying to locate the exact trouble with my system that had been responsible for my defeats in A．R．Fullerton & Co.'s office．I was twenty when I made my first ten thousand，and I lost that．But I knew how and why—because I traded out of season all the time；because when I couldn't play according to my system，which was based on study and experience，I went in and gambled．I hoped to win，instead of knowing that I ought to win on form．When I was about twenty-two I ran up my stake to fifty thousand dollars；I lost it on May ninth．But I knew exactly why and how．It was the laggard tape and the unprecedented violence of the movements that awful day．But I didn't know why I had lost after my return from St．Louis or after the May ninth panic．I had theories—that is，remedies for some of the faults that I thought I found in my play．But I needed actual practice．

There is nothing like losing all you have in the world for teaching you what not to do．And when you know what not to do in order not to lose money，you begin to learn what to do in order to win．Did you get that？You begin to learn！





Chapter V


THE average ticker hound—or，as they used to call him，tape-worm—goes wrong，I suspect，as much from as from anything else．It means a highly expensive inelasticity．After all，the game of speculation isn't all mathematics or set rules，however rigid the main laws may be．Even in my tape reading something enters that is more than mere arithmetic．There is what I call the behavior of a stock，actions that enable you to judge whether or not it is going to proceed in accordance with the precedents that your observation has noted．If a stock doesn't act right don't touch it；because，being unable to tell precisely what is wrong，you cannot tell which way it is going．No diagnosis，no prognosis．No prognosis，no profit．

It is a very old thing，this of noting the behavior of a stock and studying its past performances．When I first came to New York there was a broker's office where a Frenchman used to talk about his chart．At first I thought he was a sort of pet freak kept by the firm because they were good-natured．Then I learned that he was a persuasive and most impressive talker．He said that the only thing that didn't lie because it simply couldn't was mathematics．By means of his curves he could forecast market movements．Also he could analyse them，and tell，for instance，why Keene did the right thing in his famous Atchison preferred bull manipulation，and later why he went wrong in his Southern Pacific pool．At various times one or another of the professional traders tried the Frenchman's system—and then went back to their old unscientific methods of making a living．Their hit-or-miss system was cheaper，they said．I heard that the Frenchman said Keene admitted that the chart was 100 per cent right but claimed that the method was too slow for practical use in an active market．

Then there was one office where a chart of the daily movement of prices was kept．It showed at a glance just what each stock had done for months．By comparing individual curves with the general market curve and keeping in mind certain rules the customers could tell whether the stock on which they got an unscientific tip to buy was fairly entitled to a rise．They used the chart as a sort of complementary tipster．Today there are scores of commission houses when you find trading charts．They come ready-made from the offices of statistical experts and include not only stocks but also commodities．

“I should say that a chart helps those who can read it or rather who can assimilate what they read．The average chart reader，however，is apt to become obsessed with the notion that the dips and peaks and primary and secondary movements are all there is to stock speculation．If he pushes his confidence to its logical limit he is bound to go broke．There is an extremely able man，a former partner of a well-known Stock Exchange house，who is really a trained mathematician．He is a graduate of a famous technical school．He devised charts based upon a very careful and minute study of the behavior of prices in many markets—stocks，bonds，grain，cotton，money，and so on．He went back years and years and traced the correlations and seasonal movements—oh，everything．He used his charts in his stock trading for years．What he really did was to take advantage of some highly intelligent averaging．They tell me he won regularly—until the World War knocked all precedents into a cocked hat．I heard that he and his large following lost millions before they desisted．But not even a world war can keep the stock market from being a bull market when conditions are bullish，or a bear market when conditions are bearish．And all a man needs to know to make money is to appraise conditions．

I didn't mean to get off the track like that，but I can't help it when I think of my first few years in Wall Street．I know now what I did not know then，and I think of the mistakes of my ignorance because those are the very mistakes that the average stock speculator makes year in and year out．

After I got back to New York to try for the third time to beat the market in a Stock Exchange house I traded quite actively．I didn't expect to do as well as I did in the bucket shops，but I thought that after a while I would do much better because I would be able to swing a much heavier line．Yet，I can see now that my main trouble was my failure to grasp the vital difference between stock gambling and stock speculation．Still，by reason of my seven years' experience in reading the tape and a certain natural aptitude for the game，my stake was earning not indeed a fortune but a very high rate of interest．I won and lost as before，but I was winning on balance．The more I made the more I spent．This is the usual experience with most men．No，not necessarily with easy-money pickers，but with every human being who is not a slave of the hoarding instinct．Some men，like old Russell Sage，have the money-making and the money-hoarding instinct equally well developed，and of course they die disgustingly rich．

The game of beating the market exclusively interested me from ten to three every day，and after three，the game of living my life．Don't misunderstand me．I never allowed pleasure to interfere with business．When I lost it was because I was wrong and not because I was suffering from dissipation or excesses．There never were any shattered nerves or rum-shaken limbs to spoil my game．I couldn't afford anything that kept me from feeling physically and mentally fit．Even now I am usually in bed by ten．As a young man I never kept late hours，because I could not do business properly on insufficient sleep．I was doing better than breaking even and that is why I didn't think there was any need to deprive myself of the good things of life．The market was always there to supply them．I was acquiring the confidence that comes to a man from a professionally dispassionate attitude toward his own method of providing bread and butter for himself．

The first change I made in my play was in the matter of time．I couldn't wait for the sure thing to come along and then take a point or two out of it as I could in the bucket shops．I had to start much earlier if I wanted to catch the move in Fullerton's office．In other words，I had to study what was going to happen；to anticipate stock movements．That sounds asininely commonplace，but you know what I mean．It was the change in my own attitude toward the game that was of supreme importance to me．It taught me，little by little，the essential difference between betting on fluctuations and anticipating inevitable advances and declines，between gambling and speculating．

I had to go further back than an hour in my studies of the market—which was something I never would have learned to do in the biggest bucket shop in the world．I interested myself in trade reports and railroad earnings and financial and commercial statistic．Of course I loved to trade heavily and they called me the Boy Plunger；but I also liked to study the moves．I never thought that anything was irksome if it helped me to trade more intelligently．Before I can solve a problem I must state it to myself．When I think I have found the solution I must prove I am right．I know of only one way to prove it；and that is，with my own money．

Slow as my progress seems now，I suppose I learned as fast as I possibly could，considering that I was making money on balance．If I had lost oftener perhaps it might have spurred me to more continuous study．I certainly would have had more mistakes to spot．But I am not sure of the exact value of losing，for if I had lost more I would have lacked the money to test out the improvements in my methods of trading．

Studying my winning plays in Fullerton's office I discovered that although I often was 100 per cent right on the market—that is，in my diagnosis of conditions and general trend—I was not making as much money as my market“rightness”entitled me to．Why wasn't I？

There was as much to learn from partial victory as from defeat．

For instance，I had been bullish from the very start of a bull market，and I had backed my opinion by buying stocks．An advance followed，as I had clearly foreseen．So far，all very well．But what else did I do？Why，I listened to the elder statesmen and curbed my youthful impetuousness．I made up my mind to be wise and play carefully，conservatively．Everybody knew that the way to do that was to take profits and buy back your stocks on reactions．And that is precisely what I did，or rather what I tried to do；for I often took profits and waited for a reaction that never came．And I saw my stock go kiting up ten points more and I sitting there with my four-point profit safe in my conservative pocket．They say you never grow poor taking profits．No，you don't．But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market．

Where I should have made twenty thousand dollars I made two thousand．That was what my conservatism did for me．About the time I discovered what a small percentage of what I should have made I was getting I discovered something else，and that is that suckers differ among themselves according to the degree of experience．

The tyro knows nothing，and everybody，including himself，knows it．But the next，or second，grade thinks he knows a great deal and makes others feel that way too．He is the experienced sucker，who has studied—not the market itself but a few remarks about the market made by a still higher grade of suckers．The second-grade sucker knows how to keep from losing his money in some of the ways that get the raw beginner．It is this semisucker rather than the 100 per cent article who is the real all-the-year-round support of the commission houses．He lasts about three and a half years on an average，as compared with a single season of from three to thirty weeks—which is the usual Wall Street life of a first offender．It is naturally the semisucker who is always quoting the famous trading aphorisms and the various rules of the game．He knows all the don'ts that ever fell from the oracular lips of the old stagers—excepting the principal one，which is：Don't be a sucker！

This semisucker is the type that thinks he has cut his wisdom teeth because he loves to buy on declines．He waits for them．He measures his bargains by the number of points it has sold off from the top．In big bull markets the plain unadulterated sucker，utterly ignorant of rules and precedents，buys blindly because he hopes blindly．He makes most of the money—until one of the healthy reactions takes it away from him at one fell swoop．But the Careful Mike sucker does what I did when I thought I was playing the game intelligently—according to the intelligence of others．I knew I needed to change my bucket-shop methods and I thought I was solving my problem with any change，particularly one that assayed high gold values according to the experienced traders among the customers．

Most—let us call'em customers—are alike．You find very few who can truthfully say that Wall Street doesn't owe them money．In Fullerton's there were the usual crowd．All grades！Well，there was one old chap who was not like the others．To begin with，he was a much older man．Another thing was that he never volunteered advice and never bragged of his winnings．He was a great hand for listening very attentively to the others．He did not seem very keen to get tips—that is，he never asked the talkers what they'd heard or what they knew．But when somebody gave him one he always thanked the tipster very politely．Sometimes he thanked the tipster again—when the tip turned out O．K．But if it went wrong he never whined，so that nobody could tell whether he followed it or let it slide by．It was a legend of the office that the old jigger was rich and could swing quite a line．But he wasn't donating much to the firm in the way of commissions；at least not that anyone could see．His name was Partridge，but they nicknamed him Turkey behind his back，because he was so thick-chested and had a habit of strutting about the various rooms，with the point of his chin resting on his breast．

The customers，who were all eager to be shoved and forced into doing things so as to lay the blame for failure on others，used to go to old Partridge and tell him what some friend of a friend of an insider had advised them to do in a certain stock．They would tell him what they had not done with the tip so he would tell them what they ought to do．But whether the tip they had was to buy or to sell，the old chap's answer was always the same．

The customer would finish the tale of his perplexity and then ask：“What do you think I ought to do？”

Old Turkey would cock his head to one side，contemplate his fellow customer with a fatherly smile，and finally he would say very impressively，“You know，it's a bull market！”

Time and again I heard him say，“Well，this is a bull market，you know！”as though he were giving to you a priceless talisman wrapped up in a million-dollar accident-insurance policy．And of course I did not get his meaning．

One day a fellow named Elmer Harwood rushed into the office，wrote out an order and gave it to the clerk．Then he rushed over to where Mr．Partridge was listening politely to John Fanning's story of the time he overheard Keene give an order to one of his brokers and all that John made was a measly three points on a hundred shares and of course the stock had to go up twenty-four points in three days right after John sold out．It was at least the fourth time that John had told him that tale of woe，but old Turkey was smiling as sympathetically as if it was the first time he heard it．

Well，Elmer made for the old man and，without a word of apology to John Fanning，told Turkey，“Mr．Partridge，I have just sold my Climax Motors．My people say the market is entitled to a reaction and that I'll be able to buy it back cheaper．So you'd better do likewise．That is，if you've still got yours．”

Elmer looked suspiciously at the man to whom he had given the original tip to buy．The amateur，or gratuitous，tipster always thinks he owns the receiver of his tip body and soul，even before he knows how the tip is going to turn out．

“Yes，Mr．Harwood，I still have it．Of course！”said Turkey gratefully．It was nice of Elmer to think of the old chap．

“Well，now is the time to take your profit and get in again on the next dip，”said Elmer，as if he had just made out the deposit slip for the old man．Failing to perceive enthusiastic gratitude in the beneficiary's face Elmer went on：“I have just sold every share I owned！”

From his voice and manner you would have conservatively estimated it at ten thousand shares．

But Mr．Partridge shook his head regretfully and whined，“No！No！I can't do that！”

“What？”yelled Elmer．

“I simply can't！”said Mr．Partridge．He was in great trouble．

“Didn't I give you the tip to buy it？”

“You did，Mr．Harwood，and I am very grateful to you．Indeed，I am，sir．But—”

“Hold on！Let me talk！And didn't that stock go up seven points in ten days？Didn't it？”

“It did，and I am much obliged to you，my dear boy．But I couldn't think of selling that stock．”

“You couldn't？”asked Elmer，beginning to look doubtful himself．It is a habit with most tip givers to be tip takers．

“No，I couldn't．”

“Why not？”And Elmer drew nearer．

“Why，this is a bull market！”The old fellow said it as though he had given a long and detailed explanation．

“That's all right，”said Elmer，looking angry because of his disappointment．“I know this is a bull market as well as you do．But you'd better slip them that stock of yours and buy it back on the reaction．You might as well reduce the cost to yourself．”

“My dear boy，”said old Partridge，in great distress—“my dear boy，if I sold that stock now I'd lose my position；and then where would I be？”

Elmer Harwood threw up his hands，shook his head and walked over to me to get sympathy：“Can you beat it？”he asked me in a stage whisper．“I ask you！”

I didn't say anything．So he went on：“I give him a tip on Climax Motors．He buys five hundred shares．He's got seven points' profit and I advise him to get out and buy 'em back on the reaction that's overdue even now．And what does he say when I tell him？He says that if he sells he'll lose his job．What do you know about that？”

“I beg your pardon，Mr．Harwood；I didn't say I'd lose my job，”cut in old Turkey．“I said I'd lose my position．And when you are as old as I am and you've been through as many booms and panics as I have，you'll know that to lose your position is something nobody can afford；not even John D．Rockefeller．I hope the stock reacts and that you will be able to repurchase your line at a substantial concession，sir．But I myself can only trade in accordance with the experience of many years．I paid a high price for it and I don't feel like throwing away a second tuition fee．But I am as much obliged to you as if I had the money in the bank．It's a bull market，you know．”And he strutted away，leaving Elmer dazed．

What old Mr．Partridge said did not mean much to me until I began to think about my own numerous failures to make as much money as I ought to when I was so right on the general market．The more I studied the more I realized how wise that old chap was．He had evidently suffered from the same defect in his young days and knew his own human weaknesses．He would not lay himself open to a temptation that experience had taught him was hard to resist and had always proved expensive to him，as it was to me．

I think it was a long step forward in my trading education when I realized at last that when old Mr．Partridge kept on telling the other customers，“Well，you know this is a bull market！”he really meant to tell them that the big money was not in the individual fluctuations but in the main movements—that is，not in reading the tape but in sizing up the entire market and its trend．

And right here let me say one thing：After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this：It never was my thinking that made the big money for me．It always was my sitting．Got that？My sitting tight！It is no trick at all to be right on the market．You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets．I've known many men who were right at exactly the right time，and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit．And their experience invariably matched mine—that is，they made no real money out of it．Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon．I found it one of the hardest things to learn．But it is only after a stock operator has firmly grasped this that he can make big money．It is literally true that millions come easier to a trader after he knows how to trade than hundreds did in the days of his ignorance．

The reason is that a man may see straight and clearly and yet become impatient or doubtful when the market takes its time about doing as he figured it must do．That is why so many men in Wall Street，who are not at all in the sucker class，not even in the third grade，nevertheless lose money．The market does not beat them．They beat themselves，because though they have brains they cannot sit tight．Old Turkey was dead right in doing and saying what he did．He had not only the courage of his convictions but the intelligent patience to sit tight．

Disregarding the big swing and trying to jump in and out was fatal to me．Nobody can catch all the fluctuations．In a bull market your game is to buy and hold until you believe that the bull market is near its end．To do this you must study general conditions and not tips or special factors affecting individual stocks．Then get out of all your stocks；get out for keeps！Wait until you see—or if you prefer，until you think you see—the turn of the market；the beginning of a reversal of general conditions．You have to use your brains and your vision to do this；otherwise my advice would be as idiotic as to tell you to buy cheap and sell dear．One of the most helpful things that anybody can learn is to give up trying to catch the last eighth—or the first．These two are the most expensive eighths in the world．They have cost stock traders，in the aggregate，enough millions of dollars to build a concrete highway across the continent．

Another thing I noticed in studying my plays in Fullerton's office after I began to trade less unintelligently was that my initial operations seldom showed me a loss．That naturally made me decide to start big．It gave me confidence in my own judgment before I allowed it to be vitiated by the advice of others or even by my own impatience at times．Without faith in his own judgment no man can go very far in this game．That is about all I have learned—to study general conditions，to take a position and stick to it．I can wait without a twinge of impatience．I can see a setback without being shaken，knowing that it is only temporary．I have been short one hundred thousand shares and I have seen a big rally coming．I have figured—and figured correctly—that such a rally as I felt was inevitable，and even wholesome，would make a difference of one million dollars in my paper profits．And I nevertheless have stood pat and seen half my paper profit wiped out，without once considering the advisability of covering my shorts to put them out again on the rally．I knew that if I did I might lose my position and with it the certainty of a big killing．It is the big swing that makes the big money for you．

If I learned all this so slowly it was because I learned by my mistakes，and some time always elapses between making a mistake and realizing it，and more time between realizing it and exactly determining it．But at the same time I was faring pretty comfortably and was very young，so that I made up in other ways．Most of my winnings were still made in part through my tape reading because the kind of markets we were having lent themselves fairly well to my method．I was not losing either as often or as irritatingly as in the beginning of my New York experiences．It wasn't anything to be proud of，when you think that I had been broke three times in less than two years．And as I told you，being broke is a very efficient educational agency．

I was not increasing my stake very fast because I lived up to the handle all the time．I did not deprive myself of many of the things that a fellow of my age and tastes would want．I had my own automobile and I could not see any sense in skimping on living when I was taking it out of the market．The ticker only stopped Sundays and holidays，which was as it should be．Every time I found the reason for a loss or the why and how of another mistake，I added a brand-new Don't！to my schedule of assets．And the nicest way to capitalize my increasing assets was by not cutting down on my living expenses．Of course I had some amusing experiences and some that were not so amusing，but if I told them all in detail I'd never finish．As a matter of fact，the only incidents that I remember without special effort are those that taught me something of definite value to me in my trading；something that added to my store of knowledge of the game—and of myself！





Chapter VI


IN the spring of 1906 I was in Atlantic City for a short vacation．I was out of stocks and was thinking only of having a change of air and a nice rest．By the way，I had gone back to my first brokers，Harding Brothers，and my account had got to be pretty active．I could swing three or four thousand shares．That wasn't much more than I had done in the old Cosmopolitan shop when I was barely twenty years of age．But there was some difference between my one-point margin in the bucket shop and the margin required by brokers who actually bought or sold stocks for my account on the New York Stock Exchange．

You may remember the story I told you about that time when I was short thirty-five hundred Sugar in the Cosmopolitan and I had a hunch something was wrong and I'd better close the trade？Well，I have often had that curious feeling．As a rule，I yield to it．But at times I have pooh-poohed the idea and have told myself that it was simply asinine to follow any of these sudden blind impulses to reverse my position．I have ascribed my hunch to a state of nerves resulting from too many cigars or insufficient sleep or a torpid liver or something of that kind．When I have argued myself into disregarding my impulse and have stood pat I have always had cause to regret it．A dozen instances occur to me when I did not sell as per hunch，and the next day I'd go downtown and the market would be strong，or perhaps even advance，and I'd tell myself how silly it would have been to obey the blind impulse to sell．But on the following day there would be a pretty bad drop．Something had broken loose somewhere and I'd have made money by not being so wise and logical．The reason plainly was not physiological but psychological．

I want to tell you only about one of them because of what it did for me．It happened when I was having that little vacation in Atlantic City in the spring of 1906．I had a friend with me who also was a customer of Harding Brothers．I had no interest in the market one way or another and was enjoying my rest．I can always give up trading to play，unless of course it is an exceptionally active market in which my commitments are rather heavy．It was a bull market，as I remember it．The outlook was favorable for general business and the stock market had slowed down but the tone was firm and all indications pointed to higher prices．

One morning after we had breakfasted and had finished reading all the New York morning papers，and had got tired of watching the sea gulls picking up clams and flying up with them twenty feet in the air and dropping them on the hard wet sand to open them for their breakfast，my friend and I started up the Boardwalk．That was the most exciting thing we did in the daytime．

It was not noon yet，and we walked up slowly to kill time and breathe the salt air．Harding Brothers had a branch office on the Boardwalk and we used to drop in every morning and see how they'd opened．It was more force of habit than anything else，for I wasn't doing anything．

The market，we found，was strong and active．My friend，who was quite bullish，was carrying a moderate line purchased several points lower．He began to tell me what an obviously wise thing it was to hold stocks for much higher prices．I wasn't paying enough attention to him to take the trouble to agree with him．I was looking over the quotation board，noting the changes—they were mostly advances—until I came to Union Pacific．I got a feeling that I ought to sell it．I can't tell you more．I just felt like selling it．I asked myself why I should feel like that，and I couldn't find any reason whatever for going short of UP．

I stared at the last price on the board until I couldn't see any figures or any board or anything else，for that matter．All I knew was that I wanted to sell Union Pacific and I couldn't find out why I wanted to．

I must have looked queer，for my friend，who was standing alongside of me，suddenly nudged me and asked，“Hey，what's the matter？”

“I don't know，”I answered．

“Going to sleep？”he said．

“No，”I said．“I am not going to sleep．What I am going to do is to sell that stock．”I had always made money following my hunches．

I walked over to a table where there were some blank order pads．My friend followed me．I wrote out an order to sell a thousand Union Pacific at the market and handed it to the manager．He was smiling when I wrote it and when he took it．But when he read the order he stopped smiling and looked at me．

“Is this right？”he asked me．But I just looked at him and he rushed it over to the operator．

“What are you doing？”asked my friend．

“I'm selling it！”I told him．

“Selling what？”he yelled at me．If he was a bull how could I be a bear？Something was wrong．

“A thousand UP，”I said．

“Why？”he asked me in great excitement．

I shook my head，meaning I had no reason．But he must have thought I'd got a tip，because he took me by the arm and led me outside into the hall，where we could be out of sight and hearing of the other customers and rubbering chairwarmers．

“What did you bear？”he asked me．

He was quite excited．UP．was one of his pets and he was bullish on it because of its earnings and its prospects．But he was willing to take a bear tip on it at second hand．

“Nothing ！”I said．

“You didn't？”He was skeptical and showed it plainly．

“I didn't hear a thing．”

“Then why in blazes are you selling？”

“I don't know，”I told him．I spoke gospel truth．

“Oh，come across，Larry，”he said．

He knew it was my habit to know why I traded．I had sold a thousand shares of Union Pacific．I must have a very good reason to sell that much stock in the face of the strong market．

“I don't know，”I repeated．“I just feel that something is going to happen．”

“What's going to happen？”

“I don't know．I can't give you any reason．All I know is that I want to sell that stock．And I'm going to let 'em have another thousand．”

I walked back into the office and gave an order to sell a second thousand．If I was right in selling the first thousand I ought to have out a little more．

“What could possibly happen？”persisted my friend，who couldn't make up his mind to follow my lead．If I'd told him that I had heard UP．was going down he'd have sold it without asking me from whom I'd heard it or why．“What could possibly happen？”he asked again．

“A million things could happen．But I can't promise you that any of them will．I can't give you any reasons and I can't tell fortunes，”I told him．

“Then you're crazy，”he said．“Stark crazy，selling that stock without rime or reason．You don't know why you want to sell it？”

“I don't know why I want to sell it．I only know I do want to，”I said．“I want to，like everything．”The urge was so strong that I sold another thousand．

That was too much for my friend．He grabbed me by the arm and said，“Here！Let's get out of this place before you sell the entire capital stock．”

I had sold as much as I needed to satisfy my feeling，so I followed him without waiting for a report on the last two thousand shares．It was a pretty good jag of stock for me to sell even with the best of reasons．It seemed more than enough to be short of without any reason whatever，particularly when the entire market was so strong and there was nothing in sight to make anybody think of the bear side．But I remembered that on previous occasions when I had the same urge to sell and didn't do it I always had reasons to regret it．

I have told some of these stories to friends，and some of them tell me it isn't a hunch but the subconscious mind，which is the creative mind，at work．That is the mind which makes artists do things without their knowing how they came to do them．Perhaps with me it was the cumulative effect of a lot of little things individually insignificant but collectively powerful．Possibly my friend's unintelligent bullishness aroused a spirit of contradiction and I picked on UP．because it had been touted so much．I can't tell you what the cause or motive for hunches may be．All I know is that I went out of the Atlantic City branch office of Harding Brothers short three thousand Union Pacific in a rising market，and I wasn't worried a bit．

I wanted to know what price they'd got for my last two thousand shares．So after luncheon we walked up to the office．I had the pleasure of seeing that the general market was strong and Union Pacific higher．

“I see your finish，”said my friend．You could see he was glad he hadn't sold any．

The next day the general market went up some more and I heard nothing but cheerful remarks from my friend．But I felt sure I had done right to sell UP.，and I never get impatient when I feel I am right．What's the sense？That afternoon Union Pacific stopped climbing，and toward the end of the day it began to go off．Pretty soon it got down to a point below the level of the average of my three thousand shares．I felt more positive than ever that I was on the right side，and since I felt that way I naturally had to sell some more．So，toward the close，I sold an additional two thousand shares．

There I was，short five thousand shares of UP．on a hunch．That was as much as I could sell in Harding's office with the margin I had up．It was too much stock for me to be short of，on a vacation；so I gave up the vacation and returned to New York that very night．There was no telling what might happen and I thought I'd better be Johnny-on-the-spot．There I could move quickly if I had to．

The next day we got the news of the San Francisco earthquake．It was an awful disaster．But the market opened down only a couple of points．The bull forces were at work，and the public never is independently responsive to news．You see that all the time．If there is a solid bull foundation，for instance，whether or not what the papers call bull manipulation is going on at the same time，certain news items fail to have the effect they would have if the Street was bearish．It is all in the state of sentiment at the time．In this case the Street did not appraise the extent of the catastrophe because it didn't wish to．Before the day was over prices came back．

I was short five thousand shares．The blow had fallen，but my stock hadn't．My hunch was of the first water，but my bank account wasn't growing；not even on paper．The friend who had been in Atlantic City with me when I put out my short line in UP．was glad and sad about it．

He told me：“That was some hunch，kid．But，say，when the talent and the money are all on the bull side what's the use of bucking against them？They are bound to win out．”

“Give them time，”I said．I meant prices．I wouldn't cover because I knew the damage was enormous and the Union Pacific would be one of the worst sufferers．But it was exasperating to see the blindness of the Street．

“Give 'em time and your skin will be where all the other bear hides are stretched out in the sun，drying，”he assured me．

“What would you do？”I asked him．“Buy UP．on the strength of the millions of dollars of damage suffered by the Southern Pacific and other lines？Where are the earnings for dividends going to come from after they pay for all they've lost？The best you can say is that the trouble may not be as bad as it is painted．But is that a reason for buying the stocks of the roads chiefly affected？Answer me that．”

But all my friend said was：“Yes，that listens fine．But I tell you，the market doesn't agree with you．The tape doesn't lie，does it？”

“It doesn't always tell the truth on the instant，”I said．

“Listen．A man was talking to Jim Fisk a little before Black Friday，giving ten good reasons why gold ought to go down for keeps．He got so encouraged by his own words that he ended by telling Fisk that he was going to sell a few million．And Jim Fisk just looked at him and said，“Go ahead！Do！Sell it short and invite me to your funeral．’”

“Yes，”I said；“and if that chap had sold it short，look at the killing he would have made！Sell some UP．yourself．”

“Not I！I'm the kind that thrives best on not rowing against wind and tide．”

On the following day，when fuller reports came in，the market began to slide off，but even then not as violently as it should．Knowing that nothing under the sun could stave off a substantial break I doubled up and sold five thousand shares．Oh，by that time it was plain to most people，and my brokers were willing enough．It wasn't reckless of them or of me，not the way I sized up the market．On the day following，the market began to go for fair．There was the dickens to pay．Of course I pushed my luck for all it was worth．I doubled up again and sold ten thousand shares more．It was the only play possible．

I wasn't thinking of anything except that I was right—100 per cent right—and that this was a heaven-sent opportunity．It was up to me to take advantage of it．I sold more．Did I think that with such a big line of shorts out，it wouldn't take much of a rally to wipe out my paper profits and possibly my principal？I don't know whether I thought of that or not，but if I did it didn't carry much weight with me．I wasn't plunging recklessly．I was really playing conservatively．There was nothing that anybody could do to undo the earthquake，was there？They couldn't restore the crumpled buildings overnight，free，gratis，for nothing，could they？All the money in the world couldn't help much in the next few hours，could it？

I was not betting blindly．I wasn't a crazy bear．I wasn't drunk with success or thinking that because Frisco was pretty well wiped off the map the entire country was headed for the scrap heap．No，indeed！I didn't look for a panic．Well，the next day I cleaned up．I made two hundred and fifty thousand dollars．It was my biggest winnings up to that time．It was all made in a few days．The Street paid no attention to the earthquake the first day or two．They'll tell you that it was because the first dispatches were not so alarmring，but I think it was because it took so long to change the point of view of the public toward the securities markets．Even the professional traders for the most part were slow and shortsighted．

I have no explanation to give you，either scientific or childish．I am telling you what I did，and why，and what came of it．I was much less concerned with the mystery of the hunch than with the fact that I got a quarter of a million out of it．It meant that I could now swing a much bigger line than ever，if or when the time came for it．

That summer I went to Saratoga Springs．It was supposed to be a vacation for me，but I kept an eye on the market．To begin with，I wasn't so tired that it bothered me to think about it．And then，everybody I knew up there had or had had an active interest in it．We naturally talked about it．I have noticed that there is quite a difference between talking and trading．Some of these chaps remind you of the bold clerk who talks to his cantankerous employer as to a yellow dog—when he tells you about it．

Harding Brothers had a branch office in Saratoga．Many of their customers were there．But the real reason，I suppose，was the advertising value．Having a branch office in a resort is simply high-class billboard advertising．I used to drop in and sit around with the rest of the crowd．The manager was a very nice chap from the New York office who was there to give the glad hand to friends and strangers and，if possible，to get business．It was a wonderful place for tips—all kinds of tips，horse-race，stock-market，and waiters'．The office knew I didn't take any，so the manager didn't come and whisper confidentially in my ear what he'd just got on the q．t．from the New York office．He simply passed over the telegrams，saying，“This is what they're sending out，”or something of the kind．

Of course I watched the market．With me，to look at the quotation board and to read the signs is one process．My good friend Union Pacific，I noticed，looked like going up．The price was high，but the stock acted as if it were being accumulated．I watched it a couple of days without trading in it，and the more I watched it the more convinced I became that it was being bought on balance by somebody who was no piker，somebody who not only had a big bank roll but knew what was what．Very clever accumulation，I thought．

As soon as I was sure of this I naturally began to buy it，at about 160．It kept on acting all hunky，and so I kept on buying it，five hundred shares at a clip．The more I bought the stronger it got，without any spurt，and I was feeling very comfortable．I couldn't see any reason why that stock shouldn't go up a great deal more；not with what I read on the tape．

All of a sudden the manager came to me and said they'd got a message from New York—they had a direct wire of course—asking if I was in the office，and when they answered yes，another came saying：“Keep him there．Tell him Mr．Harding wants to speak to him．”

I said I'd wait，and bought five hundred shares more of UP．I couldn't imagine what Harding could have to say to me．I didn't think it was anything about business．My margin was more than ample for what I was buying．Pretty soon the manager came and told me that Mr．Ed Harding wanted me on the long-distance telephone．

“Hello，Ed，”I said．

But he said，“What the devil's the matter with you？Are you crazy？”

“Are you？”I said．

“What are you doing？”he asked．

“What do you mean？”

“Buying all that stock．”‘

“Why，isn't my margin all right？”

“It isn't a case of margin，but of being a plain sucker．”

“I don't get you．”

“Why are you buying all that Union Pacific？”

“It's going up，”I said．

“Going up，hell！Don't you know that the insiders are feeding it out to you？You're just about the easiest mark up there．You'd have more fun losing it on the ponies．Don't let them kid you．”

“Nobody is kidding me，”I told him．“I haven't talked to a soul about it．”

But he came back at me：“You can't expect a miracle to save you every time you plunge in that stock．Get out while you've still got a & chance，”he said．“It's a crime to be long of that stock at this level—when these highbinders are shoveling it out by the ton．”

“The tape says they're buying it，”I insisted．

“Larry，I got heart disease when your orders began to come in．For the love of Mike，don't be a sucker．Get out！Right away．It's liable to bust wide open any minute．I've done my duty．Good-by！”And he hung up．

Ed Harding was a very clever chap，unusually well-informed and a real friend，disinterested and kind-hearted．And what was even more，I knew he was in position to hear things．All I had to go by，in my purchases of UP.，was my years of studying the behaviour of stocks and my perception of certain symptoms which experience had taught me usually accompanied a substantial rise．I don't know what happened to me，but I suppose I must have concluded that my tape reading told me the stock was being absorbed simply because very clever manipulation by the insiders made the tape tell a story that wasn't true．Possibly I was impressed by the pains Ed Harding took to stop me from making what he was so sure would be a colossal mistake on my part．Neither his brains nor his motives were to be questioned．Whatever it was that made me decide to follow his advice，I cannot tell you；but follow it，I did．

I sold out all my Union Pacific．Of course if it was unwise to be long of it it was equally unwise not to be short of it．So after I got rid of my long stock I sold four thousand shares short．I put out most of it around 162．

The next day the directors of the Union Pacific Company declared a 10 per cent dividend on the stock．At first nobody in Wall Street believed it．It was too much like the desperate manoeuvre of cornered gamblers．All the newspapers jumped on the directors．But while the Wall Street talent hesitated to act the market boiled over．Union Pacific led，and on huge transactions made a hew high-record price．Some of the room traders made fortunes in an hour and I remember later hearing about a rather dull-witted specialist who made a mistake that put three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in his pocket．He sold his seat the following week and became a gentleman farmer the following month．

Of course I realised，the moment I heard the news of the declaration of that unprecedented 10 per cent dividend，that I got what I deserved for disregarding the voice of experience and listening to the voice of a tipster．My own convictions I had set aside for the suspicions of a friend，simply because he was disinterested and as a rule knew what he was doing．

As soon as I saw Union Pacific making new high records I said to myself，“This is no stock for me to be short of．”

All I had in the world was up as margin in Harding's office．I was neither cheered nor made stubborn by the knowledge of that fact．What was plain was that I had read the tape accurately and that I had been a ninny to let Ed Harding shake my own resolution．There was no sense in recriminations，because I had no time to lose；and besides，what's done is done．So I gave an order to take in my shorts．The stock was around 165 when I sent in that order to buy in the four thousand UP．at the market．I had a three-point loss on it at that figure．Well，my brokers paid 172 and 174 for some of it before they were through．I found when I got my reports that Ed Harding's kindly intentioned interference cost me forty thousand dollars．A low price for a man to pay for not having the courage of his own convictions！It was a cheap lesson．

I wasn't worried，because the tape said still higher prices．It was an unusual move and there were no precedents for the action of the directors，but I did this time what I thought I ought to do．As soon as I had given the first order to buy four thousand shares to cover my shorts I decided to profit by what the tape indicated and so I went along．I bought four thousand shares and held that stock until the next morning．Then I got out．I not only made up the forty thousand dollars I had lost but about fifteen thousand besides．If Ed Harding hadn't tried to save me money I'd have made a killing．But he did me a very great service，for it was the lesson of that episode that，I firmly believe，completed my education as a trader．

It was not that all I needed to learn was not to take tips but follow my own inclination．It was that I gained confidence in myself and I was able finally to shake off the old method of trading．That Saratoga experience was my last haphazard，hit-or-miss operation．From then on I began to think of basic conditions instead of individual stocks．I promoted myself to a higher grade in the hard school of speculation．It was a long and difficult step to take．





Chapter VII


I NEVER hesitate to tell a man that I am bullish or bearish．But I do not tell people to buy or sell any particular stock．In a bear market all stocks go down and in a bull market they go up．I don't mean of course that in a bear market caused by a war，ammunition shares do not go up．I speak in a general sense．But the average man doesn't wish to be told that it is a bull or a bear market．What he desires is to be told specifically which particular stock to buy or sell．He wants to get something for nothing．He does not wish to work．He doesn't even wish to have to think．It is too much bother to have to count the money that he picks up from the ground．

Well，I wasn't that lazy，but I found it easier to think of individual stocks than of the general market and therefore of individual fluctuations rather than of general movements．I had to change and I did．

People don't seem to grasp easily the fundamentals of stock trading．I have often said that to buy on a rising market is the most comfortable way of buying stocks．Now，the point is not so much to buy as cheap as possible or go short at top prices，but to buy or sell at the right time．When I am bearish and I sell a stock，each sale must be at a lower level than the previous sale．When I am buying，the reverse is true．I must buy on a rising scale．I don't buy long stock on a scale down，I buy on a scale up．

Let us suppose，for example，that I am buying some stock．I'll buy two thousand shares at 110．If the stock goes up to 111 after I buy it I am，at least temporarily，right in my operation，because it is a point higher；it shows me a profit．Well，because I am right I go in and buy another two thousand shares．If the market is still rising I buy a third lot of two thousand shares．Say the price goes to 114．I think it is enough for the time being．I now have a trading basis to work from．I am long six thousand shares at an average of 111¾ and the stock is selling at 114．I won't buy any more just then．I wait and see．I figure that at some stage of the rise there is going to be a reaction．I want to see how the market takes care of itself after that reaction．It will probably react to where I got my third lot．Say that after going higher it falls back to 112¼，and then rallies．Well，just as it goes back to 113¾ I shoot an order to buy four thousand at the market of course．Well，if I get that four thousand at 113¾ I know something is wrong and I'll give a testing order—that is，I'll sell one thousand shares to see how the market takes it．But suppose that of the order to buy the four thousand shares that I put in when the price was 113¾ I get two thousand at 114 and five hundred at 114½ and the rest on the way up so that for the last five hundred I pay 115½．Then I know I am right．It is the way I get the four thousand shares that tells me whether I am right in buying that particular stock at that particular time—for of course I am working on the assumption that I have checked up general conditions pretty well and they are bullish．I never want to buy stocks too cheap or too easily．

I remember a story I heard about Deacon S．V．White when he was one of the big operators of the Street．He was a very fine old man，clever as they make them，and brave．He did some wonderful things in his day，from all I've heard．

It was in the old days when Sugar was one of the most continuous purveyors of fireworks in the market．H．O．Havemeyer，president of the company，was in the heyday of his power．I gather from talks with the old-timers that H．O．and his following had all the resources of cash and cleverness necessary to put through successfully any deal in their own stock．They tell me that Havemeyer trimmed more small professional traders in that stock than any other insider in any other stock．As a rule，the floor traders are more likely to thwart the insiders' game than help it．

One day a man who knew Deacon White rushed into the office all excited and said，“Deacon，you told me if I ever got any good information to come to you at once with it and if used it you'd carry me for a few hundred shares．”He paused for breath and for confirmation．

The deacon looked at him in that meditative way he had and said，“I don't know whether I ever told you exactly that or not，but I am willing to pay for information that I can use．”

“Well，I've got it for you．”

“Now，that's nice，”said the deacon，so mildly that the man with the info swelled up and said，“Yes，sir，deacon．”Then he came closer so nobody else would hear and said，“H．O．Havemeyer is buying Sugar．”

“Is he？”asked the deacon quite calmly．

It peeved the informant，who said impressively：“Yes，sir．Buying all he can get，deacon．”

“My friend，are you sure？”asked old S．V．

“Deacon，I know it for a positive fact．The old inside gang are buying all they can lay their hands on．It's got something to do with the tariff and there's going to be a killing in the common．It will cross the preferred．And that means a sure thirty points for a starter．”

“D' you really think so？”And the old man looked at him over the top of the old-fashioned silver-rimmed spectacles that he had put on to look at the tape．

“Do I think so？No，I don't think so；I know so．Absolutely！Why，deacon，when H．O．Havemeyer and his friends buy Sugar as they're doing now they're never satisfied with anything less than forty points net．I shouldn't be surprised to see the market get away from them any minute and shoot up before they've got their full lines．There ain't as much of it kicking around the brokers' offices as there was a month ago．”

“He's buying Sugar，eh？”repeated the deacon absently．

“Buying it？Why，he's scooping it in as fast as he can without putting up the price on himself．”

“So？”said the deacon．That was all．

But it was enough to nettle the tipster，and he said，“Yes，sir-ree！And I call that very good information．Why，it's absolutely straight．”

“Is it？”

“Yes；and it ought to be worth a whole lot．Are you going to use it？”

“Oh，yes．I'm going to use it．”

“When？”asked the information bringer suspiciously．

“Right away．”And the deacon called：“Frank！”It was the first name of his shrewdest broker，who was then in the adjoining room．

“Yes，sir，”said Frank．

“I wish you'd go over to the Board and sell ten thousand Sugar．”

“Sell？”yelled the tipster．There was such suffering in his voice that Frank，who had started out at a run，halted in his tracks．

“Why，yes，”said the deacon mildly．

“But I told you H．O．Havemeyer was buying it！”

“I know you did，my friend，”said the deacon calmly；and turning to the broker：“Make haste，Frank！”

The broker rushed out to execute the order and the tipster turned red．

“I came in here，”he said furiously，“with the best information I ever had．I brought it to you because I thought you were my friend，and square．I expected you to act on it—”

“I am acting on it，”interrupted the deacon in a tranquillising voice．

“But I told you H．O．and his gang were buying！”

“That's right．I heard you．”

“Buying！Buying！I said buying！”shrieked the tipster．

“Yes，buying！That is what I understood you to say，”the deacon assured him．He was standing by the ticker，looking at the tape．

“But you are selling it．”

“Yes；ten thousand shares．”And the deacon nodded．“Selling it，of course．”

He stopped talking to concentrate on the tape and the tipster approached to see what the deacon saw，for the old man was very foxy．While he was looking over the deacon's shoulder a clerk came in with a slip，obviously the report from Frank．The deacon barely glanced at it．He had seen on the tape how his order had been executed．

It made him say to the clerk，“Tell him to sell another ten thousand Sugar．”

“Deacon，I swear to you that they really are buying the stock ！”

“Did Mr．Havemeyer tell you？”asked the deacon quietly．

“Of course not！He never tells anybody anything．He would not bat an eyelid to help his best friend make a nickel．But I know this is true．”

“Do not allow yourself to become excited，my friend．”And the deacon held up a hand．He was looking at the tape．The tip-bringer said，bitterly：

“If I had known you were going to do the opposite of what I expected I'd never have wasted your time or mine．But I am not going to feel glad when you cover that stock at an awful loss．I'm sorry for you，deacon．Honest！If you'll excuse me I'll go elsewhere and act on my own information．”

“I'm acting on it．I think I know a little about the market；not as much，perhaps，as you and your friend H．O．Havemeyer，but still a little．What I am doing is what my experience tells me is the wise thing to do with the information you brought me．After a man has been in Wall Street as long as I have he is grateful for anybody who feels sorry for him．Remain calm，my friend．”

The man just stared at the deacon，for whose judgment and nerve he had great respect．

Pretty soon the clerk came in again and handed a report to the deacon，who looked at it and said：“Now tell him to buy thirty thousand Sugar．Thirty thousand ！”

The clerk hurried away and the tipster just grunted and looked at the old gray fox．

“My friend，”the deacon explained kindly，“I did not doubt that you were telling me the truth as you saw it．But even if I had heard H．O．Havemeyer tell you himself，I still would have acted as I did．For there was only one way to find out if anybody was buying the stock in the way you said H．O．Havemeyer and his friends were buying it，and that was to do what I did．The first ten thousand shares went fairly easily．It was not quite conclusive．But the second ten thousand was absorbed by a market that did not stop rising．The way the twenty thousand shares were taken by somebody proved to me that somebody was in truth willing to take all the stock that was offered．It doesn't particularly matter at this point who that particular somebody may be．So I have covered my shorts and am long ten thousand shares，and I think that your information was good as far as it went．”

“And how far does it go？”asked the tipster．

“You have five hundred shares in this office at the average price of the ten thousand shares，”said the deacon．“Good day，my friend．Be calm the next time．”

“Say，deacon，”said the tipster，“won't you please sell mine when you sell yours？I don't know as much as I thought I did．”

That's the theory．That is why I never buy stocks cheap．Of course I always try to buy effectively—in such a way as to help my side of the market．When it comes to selling stocks，it is plain that nobody can sell unless somebody wants those stocks．

If you operate on a large scale you will have to bear that in mind all the time．A man studies conditions，plans his operations carefully and proceeds to act．He swings a pretty fair line and he accumulates a big profit—on paper．Well，that man can't sell at will．You can't expect the market to absorb fifty thousand shares of one stock as easily as it does one hundred．He will have to wait until he has a market there to take it．There comes the time when he thinks the requisite buying power is there．When that opportunity comes he must seize it．As a rule he will have been waiting for it．He has to sell when he can，not when he wants to．To learn the time，he has to watch and test．It is no trick to tell when the market can take what you give it．But in starting a movement it is unwise to take on your full line unless you are convinced that conditions are exactly right．Remember that stocks are never too high for you to begin buying or too low to begin selling．But after the initial transaction，don't make a second unless the first shows you a profit．Wait and watch．That is where your tape reading comes in—to enable you to decide as to the proper time for beginning．Much depends upon beginning at exactly the right time．It took me years to realize the importance of this．It also cost me some hundreds of thousands of dollars．

I don't mean to be understood as advising persistent pyramiding．A man can pyramid and make big money that he couldn't make if he didn't pyramid；of course．But what I meant to say was this：Suppose a man's line is five hundred shares of stock．I say that he ought not to buy it all at once；not if he is speculating．If he is merely gambling the only advice I have to give him is，don't！

Suppose he buys his first hundred，and that promptly shows him a loss．Why should he go to work and get more stock？He ought to see at once that he is in wrong；at least temporarily．





Chapter VIII


THE Union Pacific incident in Saratoga in the summer of 1906 made me more independent than ever of tips and talk—that is，of the opinions and surmises and suspicions of other people，however friendly or however able they might be personally．Events，not vanity，proved for me that I could read the tape more accurately than most of the people about me．I also was better equipped than the average customer of Harding Brothers in that I was utterly free from speculative prejudices．The bear side doesn't appeal to me any more than the bull side，or vice versa．My one steadfast prejudice is against being wrong．

Even as a lad I always got my own meanings out of such facts as I observed．It is the only way in which the meaning reaches me．I cannot get out of facts what somebody tells me to get．They are my facts，don't you see？If I believe something you can be sure it is because I simply must．When I am long of stocks it is because my reading of conditions has made me bullish．But you find many people，reputed to be intelligent，who are bullish because they have stocks．I do not allow my possessions—or my prepossessions either—to do any thinking for me．That is why I repeat that I never argue with the tape．To be angry at the market because it unexpectedly or even illogically goes against you is like getting mad at your lungs because you have pneumonia．

I had been gradually approaching the full realization of how much more than tape reading there was to stock speculation．Old man Partridge's insistence on the vital importance of being continuously bullish in a bull market doubtless made my mind dwell on the need above all other things of determining the kind of market a man is trading in．I began to realize that the big money must necessarily be in the big swing．Whatever might seem to give a big swing its initial impulse，the fact is that its continuance is not the result of manipulation by pools or artifice by financiers，but depends upon basic conditions．And no matter who opposes it，the swing must inevitably run as far and as fast and as long as the impelling forces determine．

After Saratoga I began to see more clearly—perhaps I should say more maturely—that since the entire list moves in accordance with the main current there was not so much need as I had imagined to study individual plays or the behaviour of this or the other stock．Also，by thinking of the swing a man was not limited in his trading．He could buy or sell the entire list．In certain stocks a short line is dangerous after a man sells more than a certain percentage of the capital stock，the amount depending upon how，where and by whom the stock is held．But he could sell a million shares of the general list—if he had the price—without the danger of being squeezed．A great deal of money used to be made periodically by insiders in the old days out of the shorts and their carefully fostered fears of corners and squeezes．

Obviously the thing to do was to be bullish in a bull market and bearish in a bear market．Sounds silly，doesn't it？But I had to grasp that general principle firmly before I saw that to put it into practice really meant to anticipate probabilities．It took me a long time to learn to trade on those lines．But in justice to myself I must remind you that up to then I had never had a big enough stake to speculate that way．A big swing will mean big money if your line is big，and to be able to swing a big line you need a big balance at your broker's．

I always had—or felt that I had—to make my daily bread out of the stock market．It interfered with my efforts to increase the stake available for the more profitable but slower and therefore more immediately expensive method of trading on swings．

But now not only did my confidence in myself grow stronger but my brokers ceased to think of me as a sporadically lucky Boy Plunger．They had made a great deal out of me in commissions，but now I was in a fair way to become their star customer and as such to have a value beyond the actual volume of my trading．A customer who makes money is an asset to any broker's office．

The moment I ceased to be satisfied with merely studying the tape I ceased to concern myself exclusively with the daily fluctuations in specific stocks，and when that happened I simply had to study the game from a different angle．I worked back from the quotation to first principles；from price fluctuations to basic conditions．

Of course I had been reading the daily dope regularly for a long time．All traders do．But much of it was gossip，some of it deliberately false，and the rest merely the personal opinion of the writers．The reputable weekly reviews when they touched upon underlying conditions were not entirely satisfactory to me．The point of view of the financial editors was not mine as a rule．It was not a vital matter for them to marshal their facts and draw their conclusions from them，but it was for me．Also there was a vast difference in our appraisal of the element of time．The analysis of the week that had passed was less important to me than the forecast of the weeks that were to come．

For years I had been the victim of an unfortunate combination of inexperience，youth and insufficient capital．But now I felt the elation of a discoverer．My new attitude toward the game explained my repeated failures to make big money in New York．But now with adequate resources，experience and confidence，I was in such a hurry to try the new key that I did not notice that there was another lock on the door—a time lock！It was a perfectly natural oversight．I had to pay the usual tuition—a good whack per each step forward．

I studied the situation in 1906 and I thought that the money outlook was particularly serious．Much actual wealth the world over had been destroyed．Everybody must sooner or later feel the pinch，and therefore nobody would be in position to help anybody．It would not be the kind of hard times that comes from the swapping of a house worth ten thousand dollars for a carload of racehorses worth eight thousand dollars．It was the complete destruction of the house by fire and of most of the horses by a railroad wreck．It was good hard cash that went up in cannon smoke in the Boer War，and the millions spent for feeding nonproducing soldiers in South Africa meant no help from British investors as in the past．Also，the earthquake and the fire in San Francisco and other disasters touched everybody—manufacturers，farmers，merchants，labourers and millionaires．The railroads must suffer greatly．I figured that nothing could stave off one peach of a smash．Such being the case there was but one thing to do—sell stocks！

I told you I had already observed that my initial transaction，after I made up my mind which way I was going to trade，was apt to show me a profit．And now when I decided to sell I plunged．Since we undoubtedly were entering upon a genuine bear market I was sure I should make the biggest killing of my career．

The market went off．Then it came back．It shaded off and then it began to advance steadily．My paper profits vanished and my paper losses grew．One day it looked as if not a bear would be left to tell the tale of the strictly genuine bear market．I couldn't stand the gaff．I covered．It was just as well．If I hadn't I wouldn't have had enough left to buy a postal card．I lost most of my fur，but it was better to live to fight another day．

I had made a mistake．But where？I was bearish in a bear market．That was wise．I had sold stocks short．That was proper．I had sold them too soon．That was costly．My position was right but my play was wrong．However，every day brought the market nearer to the inevitable smash．So I waited and when the rally began to falter and pause I let them have as much stock as my sadly diminished margins permitted．I was right this time—for exactly one whole day，for on the next there was another rally．Another big bite out of yours truly！So I read the tape and covered and waited．In due course I sold again—and again they went down promisingly and then they rudely rallied．

It looked as if the market were doing its best to make me go back to my old and simple ways of bucket-shop trading．It was the first time I had worked with a definite forward-looking plan embracing the entire market instead of one or two stocks．I figured that I must win if I held out．Of course at that time I had not developed my system of placing my bets or I would have put out my short line on a declining market，as I explained to you the last time．I would not then have lost so much of my margin．I would have been wrong but not hurt．You see，I had observed certain facts but had not learned to co-ordinate them．My incomplete observation not only did not help but actually hindered．

I have always found it profitable to study my mistakes．Thus I eventually discovered that it was all very well not to lose your bear position in a bear market，but that at all times the tape should be read to determine the propitiousness of the time for operating．If you begin right you will not see your profitable position seriously menaced；and then you will find no trouble in sitting tight．

Of course today I have greater confidence in the accuracy of my observations—in which neither hopes nor hobbies play any part—and also I have greater facilities for verifying my facts as well as for variously testing the correctness of my views．But in 1906 the succession of rallies dangerously impaired my margins．

I was nearly twenty-seven years old．I had been at the game twelve years．But the first time I traded because of a crisis that was still to come I found that I had been using a telescope．Between my first glimpse of the storm cloud and the time for cashing in on the big break the stretch was evidently so much greater than I had thought that I began to wonder whether I really saw what I thought I saw so clearly．We had had many warnings and sensational ascensions in call-money rates．Still some of the great financiers talked hopefully—at least to newspaper reporters—and the ensuing rallies in the stock market gave the lie to the calamity howlers．Was I fundamentally wrong in being bearish or merely temporarily wrong in having begun to sell short too soon？

I decided that I began too soon，but that I really couldn't help it．Then the market began to sell off．That was my opportunity．I sold all I could，and then stocks rallied again，to quite a high level．

It cleaned me out．

There I was—right and busted！

I tell you it was remarkable．What happened was this：I looked ahead and saw a big pile of dollars．Out of it stuck a sign．It had“Help yourself，”on it，in huge letters．Beside it stood a cart with“Lawrence Livingston Trucking Corporation”painted on its side．I had a brand-new shovel in my hand．There was not another soul in sight，so I had no competition in the gold-shoveling，which is one beauty of seeing the dollar-heap ahead of others．The people who might have seen it if they had stopped to look were just then looking at baseball games instead，or motoring or buying houses to be paid for with the very dollars that I saw．That was the first time that I had seen big money ahead，and I naturally started toward it on the run．Before I could reach the dollar-pile my wind went back on me and I fell to the ground．The pile of dollars was still there，but I had lost the shovel，and the wagon was gone．So much for sprinting too soon！I was too eager to prove to myself that I had seen real dollars and not a mirage．I saw，and knew that I saw．Thinking about the reward for my excellent sight kept me from considering the distance to the dollar-heap．I should have walked and not sprinted．

That is what happened．I didn't wait to determine whether or not the time was right for plunging on the bear side．On the one occasion when I should have invoked the aid of my tape-reading I didn't do it．That is how I came to learn that even when one is properly bearish at the very beginning of a bear market it is well not to begin selling in bulk until there is no danger of the engine back-firing．

I had traded in a good many thousands of shares at Harding's office in all those years，and，moreover，the firm had confidence in me and our relations were of the pleasantest．I think they felt that I was bound to be right again very shortly and they knew that with my habit of pushing my luck all I needed was a start and I'd more than recover what I had lost．They had made a great deal of money out of my trading and they would make more．So there was no trouble about my being able to trade there again as long as my credit stood high．

The succession of spankings I had received made me less aggressively cocksure；perhaps I should say less careless，for of course I knew I was just so much nearer to the smash．All I could do was wait watchfully，as I should have done before plunging．It wasn't a case of locking the stable after the horse was stolen．I simply had to be sure，the next time I tried．If a man didn't make mistakes he'd own the world in a month．But if he didn't profit by his mistakes he wouldn't own a blessed thing．

Well，sir，one fine morning I came downtown feeling cocksure once more．There wasn't any doubt this time．I had read an advertisement in the financial pages of all the newspapers that was the high sign I hadn't had the sense to wait for before plunging．It was the announcement of a new issue of stock by the Northern Pacific and Great Northern roads．The payments were to be made on the installment plan for the convenience of the stockholders．This consideration was something new in Wall Street．It struck me as more than ominous．

For years the unfailing bull item on Great Northern preferred had been the announcement that another melon was to be cut，said melon consisting of the right of the lucky stockholders to subscribe at par to a new issue of Great Northern stock．These rights were valuable，since the market price was always way above par．But now the money market was such that the most powerful banking houses in the country were none too sure the stockholders would be able to pay cash for the bargain．And Great Northern preferred was selling at about 330！

As soon as I got to the office I told Ed Harding，“The time to sell is right now．This is when I should have begun．Just look at that ad，will you？”

He had seen it．I pointed out what the bankers' confession amounted to in my opinion，but he couldn't quite see the big break right on top of us．He thought it better to wait before putting out a very big short line by reason of the market's habit of having big rallies．If I waited prices might be lower，but the operation would be safer．

“Ed，”I said to him，“the longer the delay in starting the sharper the break will be when it does start．That ad is a signed confession on the part of the bankers．What they fear is what I hope．This is a sign for us to get aboard the bear wagon．It is all we needed．If I had ten million dollars I'd stake every cent of it this minute．”

I had to do some more talking and arguing．He wasn't content with the only inferences a sane man could draw from that amazing advertisement．It was enough for me，but not for most of the people in the office．I sold a little；too little．

A few days later St．Paul very kindly came out with an announcement of an issue of its own；either stock or notes，I forget which．But that doesn't matter．What mattered then was that I noticed the moment I read it that the date of payment was set ahead of the Great Northern and Northern Pacific payments，which had been announced earlier．It was as plain as though they had used a megaphone that grand old St．Paul was trying to beat the two other railroads to what little money there was floating around in Wall Street．The St．Paul's bankers quite obviously feared that there wasn't enough for all three and they were not saying，“After you，my dear Alphonse！”If money already was that scarce—and you bet the bankers knew—what would it be later？The railroads needed it desperately．It wasn't there．What was the answer？

Sell 'em！Of course！The public，with their eyes fixed on the stock market，saw little—that week．The wise stock operators saw much—that year．That was the difference．

For me，that was the end of doubt and hesitation．I made up my mind for keeps then and there．That same morning I began what really was my first campaign along the lines that I have since followed．I told Harding what I thought and how I stood，and he made no objections to my selling Great Northern preferred at around 330，and other stocks at high prices．I profited by my earlier and costly mistakes and sold more intelligently．

My reputation and my credit were reëstablished in a jiffy．That is the beauty of being right in a broker's office，whether by accident or not．But this time I was cold-bloodedly right，not because of a hunch or from skilful reading of the tape，but as the result of my analysis of conditions affecting the stock market in general．I wasn't guessing．I was anticipating the inevitable．It did not call for any courage to sell stocks．I simply could not see anything but lower prices，and I had to act on it，didn't I？What else could I do？

The whole list was soft as mush．Presently there was a rally and people came to me to warn me that the end of the decline had been reached．The big fellows，knowing the short interest to be enormous，had decided to squeeze the stuffing out of the bears，and so forth．It would set us pessimists back a few millions．It was a cinch that the big fellows would have no mercy．I used to thank these kindly counselors．I wouldn't even argue，because then they would have thought that I wasn't grateful for the warnings．

The friend who had been in Atlantic City with me was in agony．He could understand the hunch that was followed by the earthquake．He couldn't disbelieve in such agencies，since I had made a quarter of a million by intelligently obeying my blind impulse to sell Union Pacific．He even said it was Providence working in its mysterious way to make me sell stocks when he himself was bullish．And he could understand my second UP．trade in Saratoga because he could understand any deal that involved one stock，on which the tip definitely fixed the movement in advance，either up or down．But this thing of predicting that all stocks were bound to go down used to exasperate him．What good did that kind of dope do anybody？How in blazes could a gentleman tell what to do？

I recalled old Partridge's favourite remark—“Well，this is a bull market，you know”—as though that were tip enough for anybody who was wise enough；as in truth it was．It was very curious how，after suffering tremendous losses from a break of fifteen or twenty points，people who were still hanging on，welcomed a three-point rally and were certain the bottom had been reached and complete recovery begun．

One day my friend came to me and asked me，“Have you covered？”

“Why should I？”I said．

“For the best reason in the world．”

“What reason is that？”

“To make money．They've touched bottom and what goes down must come up．Isn't that so？”

“Yes，”I answered．“First they sink to the bottom．Then they come up；but not right away．They've got to be good and dead a couple of days．It isn't time for these corpses to rise to the surface．They are not quite dead yet．”

An old-timer heard me．He was one of those chaps that are always reminded of something．He said that William R．Travers，who was bearish，once met a friend who was bullish．They exchanged market views and the friend said，“Mr．Travers，how can you be bearish with the market so stiff？”and Travers retorted，“Yes！Th-the s-s-stiffness of d-death！”It was Travers who went to the office of a company and asked to be allowed to see the books．The clerk asked him，“Have you an interest in this company？”and Travers answered，“I sh-should s-say I had！I'm sh-short t-t-twenty thousand sh-shares of the stock ！”

Well，the rallies grew feebler and feebler．I was pushing my luck for all I was worth．Every time I sold a few thousand shares of Great Northern preferred the price broke several points．I felt out weak spots elsewhere and let 'em have a few．All yielded，with one impressive exception；and that was Reading．

When everything else hit the toboggan slide Reading stood like the Rock of Gibraltar．Everybody said the stock was cornered．It certainly acted like it．They used to tell me it was plain suicide to sell Reading short．There were people in the office who were now as bearish on everything as I was．But when anybody hinted at selling Reading they shrieked for help．I myself had sold some short and was standing pat on it．At the same time I naturally preferred to seek and hit the soft spots instead of attacking the more strongly protected specialties．My tape reading found easier money for me in other stocks．

I heard a great deal about the Reading bull pool．It was a mighty strong pool．To begin with they had a lot of low-priced stock，so that their average was actually below the prevailing level，according to friends who told me．Moreover，the principal members of the pool had close connections of the friendliest character with the banks whose money they were using to carry their huge holdings of Reading．As long as the price stayed up the bankers' friendship was staunch and steadfast．One pool member's paper profit was upward of three millions．That allowed for some decline without causing fatalities．No wonder the stock stood up and defied the bears．Every now and then the room traders looked at the price，smacked their lips and proceeded to test it with a thousand shares or two．They could not dislodge a share，so they covered and went looking elsewhere for easier money．Whenever I looked at it I also sold a little more—just enough to convince myself that I was true to my new trading principles and wasn't playing favourites．

In the old days the strength of Reading might have fooled me．The tape kept on saying，“Leave it alone！”But my reason told me differently．I was anticipating a general break，and there were not going to be any exceptions，pool or no pool．

I have always played a lone hand．I began that way in the bucket shops and have kept it up．It is the way my mind works．I have to do my own seeing and my own thinking．But I can tell you after the market began to go my way I felt for the first time in my life that I had allies—the strongest and truest in the world：underlying conditions．They were helping me with all their might．Perhaps they were a trifle slow at times in bringing up the reserves，but they were dependable，provided I did not get too impatient．I was not pitting my tape-reading knack or my hunches against chance．The inexorable logic of events was making money for me．

The thing was to be right；to know it and to act accordingly．General conditions，my true allies，said“Down！”and Reading disregarded the command．It was an insult to us．It began to annoy me to see Reading holding firmly，as though everything were serene．It ought to be the best short sale in the entire list because it had not gone down and the pool was carrying a lot of stock that it would not be able to carry when the money stringency grew more pronounced．Some day the bankers' friends would fare no better than the friendless public．The stock must go with the others．If Reading didn't decline，then my theory was wrong；I was wrong；facts were wrong；logic was wrong．

I figured that the price held because the Street was afraid to sell it．So one day I gave to two brokers each an order to sell four thousand shares，at the same time．

You ought to have seen that cornered stock，that it was sure suicide to go short of，take a headlong dive when those competitive orders struck it．I let 'em have a few thousand more．The price was 111 when I started selling it．Within a few minutes I took in my entire short line at 92．

I had a wonderful time after that，and in February of 1907 I cleaned up．Great Northern preferred had gone down sixty or seventy points，and other stocks in proportion．I had made a good bit，but the reason I cleaned up was that I figured that the decline had discounted the immediate future．I looked for a fair recovery，but I wasn't bullish enough to play for a turn．I wasn't going to lose my position entirely．The market would not be right for me to trade in for a while．The first ten thousand dollars I made in the bucket shops I lost because I traded in and out of season，every day，whether or not conditions were right．I wasn't making that mistake twice．Also，don't forget that I had gone broke a little while before because I had seen this break too soon and started selling before it was time．Now when I had a big profit I wanted to cash in so that I could feel I had been right．The rallies had broken me before．I wasn't going to let the next rally wipe me out．Instead of sitting tight I went to Florida．I love fishing and I needed a rest．I could get both down there．And besides，there are direct wires between Wall Street and Palm Beach．





Chapter IX


I CRUISED off the coast of Florida．The fishing was good．I was out of stocks．My mind was easy．I was having a fine time．One day off Palm Beach some friends came alongside in a motor boat．One of them brought a newspaper with him．I hadn't looked at one in some days and had not felt any desire to see one．I was not interested in any news it might print．But I glanced over the one my friend brought to the yacht，and I saw that the market had had a big rally；ten points and more．

I told my friends that I would go ashore with them．Moderate rallies from time to time were reasonable．But the bear market was not over；and here was Wall Street or the fool public or desperate bull interests disregarding monetary conditions and marking up prices beyond reason or letting somebody else do it．It was too much for me．I simply had to take a look at the market．I didn't know what I might or might not do．But I knew that my pressing need was the sight of the quotation board．

My brokers，Harding Brothers，had a branch office in Palm Beach．When I walked in I found there a lot of chaps I knew．Most of them were talking bullish．They were of the type that trade on the tape and want quick action．Such traders don't care to look ahead very far because they don't need to with their style of play．I told you how I'd got to be known in the New York office as the Boy Plunger．Of course people always magnify a fellow's winnings and the size of the line he swings．The fellows in the office had heard that I had made a killing in New York on the bear side and they now expected that I again would plunge on the short side．They themselves thought the rally would go to a good deal further，but they rather considered it my duty to fight it．

I had come down to Florida on a fishing trip．I had been under a pretty severe strain and I needed my holiday．But the moment I saw how far the recovery in prices had gone I no longer felt the need of a vacation．I had not thought of just what I was going to do when I came ashore．But now I knew I must sell stocks．I was right，and I must prove it in my old and only way—by saying it with money．To sell the general list would be a proper，prudent，profitable and even patriotic action．

The first thing I saw on the quotation board was that Anaconda was on the point of crossing 300．It had been going up by leaps and bounds and there was apparently an aggressive bull party in it．It was an old trading theory of mine that when a stock crosses 100 or 200 or 300 for the first time the price does not stop at the even figure but goes a good deal higher，so that if you buy it as soon as it crosses the line it is almost certain to show you a profit．Timid people don't like to buy a stock at a new high record．But I had the history of such movements to guide me．

Anaconda was only quarter stock—that is，the par of the shares was only twenty-five dollars．It took four hundred shares of it to equal the usual one hundred shares of other stocks，the par value of which was one hundred dollars．I figured that when it crossed 300 it ought to keep on going and probably touch 340 in a jiffy．

I was bearish，remember，but I was also a tape-reading trader．I knew Anaconda，if it went the way I figured，would move very quickly．Whatever moves fast always appeals to me．I have learned patience and how to sit tight，but my personal preference is for fleet movements，and Anaconda certainly was no sluggard．My buying it because it crossed 300 was prompted by the desire，always strong in me，of confirming my observations．

Just then the tape was saying that the buying was stronger than the selling，and therefore the general rally might easily go a bit further．It would be prudent to wait before going short．Still I might as well pay myself wages for waiting．This would be accomplished by taking a quick thirty points out of Anaconda．Bearish on the entire market and bullish on that one stock！So I bought thirty-two thousand shares of Anaconda—that is，eight thousand full shares．It was a nice little flyer but I was sure of my premises and I figured that the profit would help to swell the margin available for bear operations later on．

On the next day the telegraph wires were down on account of a storm up North or something of the sort．I was in Harding's office waiting for news．The crowd was chewing the rag and wondering all sorts of things，as stock traders will when they can't trade．Then we got a quotation—the only one that day：Anaconda，292．

There was a chap with me，a broker I had met in New York．He knew I was long eight thousand full shares and I suspect that he had some of his own，for when we got that one quotation he certainly had a fit．He couldn't tell whether the stock at that very moment had gone off another ten points or not．The way Anaconda had gone up it wouldn't have been anything unusual for it to break twenty points．But I said to him，“Don't you worry，John．It will be all right tomorrow．”That was really the way I felt．But he looked at me and shook his head．He knew better．He was that kind．So I laughed，and I waited in the office in case some quotation trickled through．But no，sir．That one was all we got：Anaconda，292．It meant a paper loss to me of nearly one hundred thousand dollars．I had wanted quick action．Well，I was getting it．

The next day the wires were working and we got the quotations as usual．Anaconda opened at 298 and went up to 302¾，but pretty soon it began to fade away．Also，the rest of the market was not acting just right for a further rally．I made up my mind that if Anaconda went back to 301 I must consider the whole thing a fake movement．On a legitimate advance the price should have gone to 310 without stopping．If instead it reacted it meant that precedents had failed me and I was wrong；and the only thing to do when a man is wrong is to be right by ceasing to be wrong．I had bought eight thousand full shares in expectation of a thirty or forty point rise．It would not be my first mistake；nor my last．

Sure enough，Anaconda fell back to 301．The moment it touched that figure I sneaked over to the telegraph operator—they had a direct wire to the New York office—and I said to him，“Sell all my Anaconda，eight thousand full shares．”I said it in a low voice．I didn't want anybody else to know what I was doing．

He looked up at me almost in horror．But I nodded and said，“All I've got！”

“Surely，Mr．Livingston，you don't meant at the market？”and he looked as if he was going to lose a couple of millions of his own through bum execution by a careless broker．But I just told him，“Sell it！Don't argue about it！”

The two Black boys，Jim and Ollie，were in the office，out of hearing of the operator and myself．They were big traders who had come originally from Chicago，where they had been famous plungers in wheat，and were now heavy traders on the New York Stock Exchange．They were very wealthy and were high rollers for fair．

As I left the telegraph operator to go back to my seat in front of the quotation board Oliver Black nodded to me and smiled．

“You'll be sorry，Larry，”he said．

I stopped and asked him，“What do you mean？”

“Tomorrow you'll be buying it back．”

“Buying what back？”I said．I hadn't told a soul except the telegraph operator．

“Anaconda，”he said．“You'll be paying 320 for it．That wasn't a good move of yours，Larry．”And he smiled again．

“What wasn't？”And I looked innocent．

“Selling your eight thousand Anaconda at the market；in fact，insisting on it，”said Ollie Black．

I knew that he was supposed to be very clever and always traded on inside news．But how he knew my business so accurately was beyond me．I was sure the office hadn't given me away．

“Ollie，how did you know that？”I asked him．

He laughed and told me：“I got it from Charlie Kratzer．”That was the telegraph operator．

“But he never budged from his place，”I said．

“I couldn't hear you and him whispering，”he chuckled．“But I heard every word of the message he sent to the New York office for you．I learned telegraphy years ago after I had a big row over a mistake in a message．Since then when I do what you did just now—give an order by word of mouth to an operator—I want to be sure the operator sends the message as I give it to him．I know what he sends in my name．But you will be sorry you sold that Anaconda．It's going to 500．”

“Not this trip，Ollie，”I said．

He stared at me and said，“You're pretty cocky about it．”

“Not I；the tape，”I said．There wasn't any ticker there so there wasn't any tape．But he knew what I meant．

“I've heard of those birds，”he said，“who look at the tape and instead of seeing prices they see a railroad time-table of the arrival and departure of stocks．But they were in padded cells where they couldn't hurt themselves．”

I didn't answer him anything because about that time the boy brought me a memorandum．They had sold five thousand shares at 299 ¾．I knew our quotations were a little behind the market．The price on the board at Palm Beach when I gave the operator the order to sell was 301．I felt so certain that at that very moment the price at which the stock was actually selling on the Stock Exchange in New York was less，that if anybody had offered to take the stock off my hands at 296 I'd have been tickled to death to accept．What happened shows you that I am right in never trading at limits．Suppose I had limited my selling price to 300？I'd never have got it off．No，sir！When you want to get out，get out．

Now，my stock cost me about 300．They got off five hundred shares—full shares，of course—at 299¾．The next thousand they sold at 299⅝．Then a hundred at ½；two hundred at ⅜ and two hundred at ¼．The last of my stock went at 298¾．It took Harding's cleverest floor man fifteen minutes to get rid of that last one hundred shares．They didn't want to crack it wide open．

The moment I got the report of the sale of the last of my long stock I started to do what I had really come ashore to do—that is，to sell stocks．I simply had to．There was the market after its outrageous rally，begging to be sold．Why，people were beginning to talk bullish again．The course of the market，however，told me that the rally had run its course．It was safe to sell them．It did not require reflection．

The next day Anaconda opened below 296．Oliver Black，who was waiting for a further rally，had come down early to be Johnny-on-the-spot when the stock crossed 320．I don't know how much of it he was long of or whether he was long of it at all．But he didn't laugh when he saw the opening prices，nor later in the day when the stock broke still more and the report came back to us in Palm Beach that there was no market for it at all．

Of course that was all the confirmation any man needed．My growing paper profit kept reminding me that I was right，hour by hour．Naturally I sold some more stocks．Everything！It was a bear market．They were all going down．The next day was Friday，Washington's Birthday．I couldn't stay in Florida and fish because I had put out a very fair short line，for me．I was needed in New York．Who needed me？I did！Palm Beach was too far，too remote．Too much valuable time was lost telegraphing back and forth．

I left Palm Beach for New York．On Monday I had to lie in St．Augustine three hours，waiting for a train．There was a broker's office there，and naturally I had to see how the market was acting while I was waiting．Anaconda had broken several points since the last trading day．As a matter of fact，it didn't stop going down until the big break that fall．

I got to New York and traded on the bear side for about four months．The market had frequent rallies as before，and I kept covering and putting them out again．I didn't，strictly speaking，sit tight．Remember，I had lost every cent of the three hundred thousand dollars I made out of the San Francisco earthquake break．I had been right，and nevertheless had gone broke．I was now playing safe—because after being down a man enjoys being up，even if he doesn't quite make the top．The way to make money is to make it．The way to make big money is to be right at exactly the right time．In this business a man has to think of both theory and practice．A speculator must not be merely a student，he must be both a student and a speculator．

I did pretty well，even if I can now see where my campaign was tactically inadequate．When summer came the market got dull．It was a cinch that there would be nothing doing in a big way until well along in the fall．Everybody I knew had gone or was going to Europe．I though that would be a good move for me．So I cleaned up．When I sailed for Europe I was a trifle more than three-quarters of a million to the good．To me that looked like some balance．

I was in Aix-les-Bains enjoying myself．I had earned my vacation．It was good to be in a place like that with plenty of money and friends and acquaintances and everybody intent upon having a good time．Not much trouble about having that，in Aix．Wall Street was so far away that I never thought about it，and that is more than I could say of any resort in the United States．I didn't have to listen to talk about the stock market．I didn't need to trade．I had enough to last me quite a long time，and besides，when I got back I knew what to do to make much more than I could spend in Europe that summer．

One day I saw in the Paris Herald a dispatch from New York that Smelters had declared an extra dividend．They had run up the price of the stock and the entire market had come back quite strong．Of course that changed everything for me in Aix．The news simply meant that the bull cliques were still fighting desperately against conditions—against common sense and against common honesty，for they knew what was coming and were resorting to such schemes to put up the market in order to unload stocks before the storm struck them．It is possible they really did not believe the danger was as serious or as close at hand as I thought．The big men of the Street are as prone to be wishful thinkers as the politicians or the plain suckers．I myself can't work that way．In a speculator such an attitude is fatal．Perhaps a manufacturer of securities or a promoter of new enterprises can afford to indulge in hope-jags．

At all events，I knew that all bull manipulation was foredoomed to failure in that bear market．The instant I read the dispatch I knew there was only one thing to do to be comfortable，and that was to sell Smelters short．Why，the insiders as much as begged me on their knees to do it，when they increased the dividend rate on the verge of a money panic．It was as infuriating as the old“dares”of your boyhood．They dared me to sell that particular stock short．

I cabled some selling orders in Smelters and advised my friends in New York to go short of it．When I got my report from the brokers I saw the price they got was six points below the quotations I had seen in the Paris Herald．It shows you what the situation was．

My plans had been to return to Paris at the end of the month and about three weeks later sail for New York，but as soon as I received the cabled reports from my brokers I went back to Paris．The same day I arrived I called at the steamship offices and found there was a fast boat leaving for New York the next day．I took it．

There I was，back in New York，almost a month ahead of my original plans，because it was the most comfortable place to be short of the market in．I had well over half a million in cash available for margins．My return was not due to my being bearish but to my being logical．

I sold more stocks．As money got tighter call-money rates went higher and prices of stocks lower．I had foreseen it．At first，my foresight broke me．But now I was right and prospering．However，the real joy was in the consciousness that as a trader I was at last on the right track．I still had much to learn but I knew what to do．No more floundering，no more half-right methods．Tape reading was an important part of the game；so was beginning at the right time；so was sticking to your position．But my greatest discovery was that a man must study general conditions，to size them so as to be able to anticipate probabilities．In short，I had learned that I had to work for my money．I was no longer betting blindly or concerned with mastering the technic of the game，but with earning my successes by hard study and clear thinking．I also had found out that nobody was immune from the danger of making sucker plays．And for a sucker play a man gets sucker pay；for the paymaster is on the job and never loses the pay envelope that is coming to you．

Our office made a great deal of money．My own operations were so successful that they began to be talked about and，of course，were greatly exaggerated．I was credited with starting the breaks in various stocks．People I didn't know by name used to come and congratulate me．They all thought the most wonderful thing was the money I had made．They did not say a word about the time when I first talked bearish to them and they thought I was a crazy bear with a stock-market loser's vindictive grouch．That I had foreseen the money troubles was nothing．That my brokers' bookkeeper had used a third of a drop of ink on the credit side of the ledger under my name was a marvellous achievement to them．

Friends used to tell me that in various offices the Boy Plunger in Harding Brothers' office was quoted as making all sorts of threats against the bull cliques that had tried to mark up prices of various stocks long after it was plain that the market was bound to seek a much lower level．To this day they talk of my raids．

From the latter part of September on，the money market was megaphoning warnings to the entire world．But a belief in miracles kept people from selling what remained of their speculative holdings．Why，a broker told me a story the first week of October that made me feel almost ashamed of my moderation．

You remember that money loans used to be made on the floor of the Exchange around the Money Post．Those brokers who had received notice from their banks to pay call loans knew in a general way how much money they would have to borrow afresh．And of course the banks knew their position so far as loanable funds were concerned，and those which had money to loan would send it to the Exchange．This bank money was handled by a few brokers whose principal business was time loans．At about noon the renewal rate for the day was posted．Usually this represented a fair average of the loans made up to that time．Business was as a rule transacted openly by bids and offers，so that everyone knew what was going on．Between noon and about two o'clock there was ordinarily not much business done in money，but after delivery time—namely，2：15 P．M．—brokers would know exactly what their cash position for the day would be，and they were able either to go to the Money Post and lend the balances that they had over or to borrow what they required．This business also was done openly．

Well，sometime early in October the broker I was telling you about came to me and told me that brokers were getting so they didn't go to the Money Post when they had money to loan．The reason was that members of a couple of well-known commission houses were on watch there，ready to snap up any offerings of money．Of course no lender who offered money publicly could refuse to lend to these firms．They were solvent and the collateral was good enough．But the trouble was that once these firms borrowed money on call there was no prospect of the lender getting that money back．They simply said they couldn't pay it back and the lender would willy-nilly have to renew the loan．So any Stock Exchange house that had money to loan to its fellows used to send its men about the floor instead of to the Post，and they would whisper to good friends，“Want a hundred？”meaning，“Do you wish to borrow a hundred thousand dollars？”The money brokers who acted for the banks presently adopted the same plan，and it was a dismal sight to watch the Money Post．Think of it！

Why，he also told me that it was a matter of Stock Exchange etiquette in those October days for the borrower to make his own rate of interest．You see，it fluctuated between 100 and 150 per cent per annum．I suppose by letting the borrower fix the rate the lender in some strange way didn't feel so much like a usurer．But you bet he got as much as the rest．The lender naturally did not dream of not paying a high rate．He played fair and paid whatever the others did．What he needed was the money and was glad to get it．

Things got worse and worse．Finally there came the awful day of reckoning for the bulls and the optimists and the wishful thinkers and those vast hordes that，dreading the pain of a small loss at the beginning，were now about to suffer total amputation—without anaesthetics．A day I shall never forget，October 24，1907．

Reports from the money crowd early indicated that borrowers would have to pay whatever the lenders saw fit to ask．There wouldn't be enough to go around．That day the money crowd was much larger than usual．When delivery time came that afternoon there must have been a hundred brokers around the Money Post，each hoping to borrow the money that his firm urgently needed．Without money they must sell what stocks they were carrying on margin—sell at any price they could get in a market where buyers were as scarce as money—and just then there was not a dollar in sight．

My friend's partner was as bearish as I was．The firm therefore did not have to borrow，but my friend，the broker I told you about，fresh from seeing the haggard faces around the Money Post，came to me．He knew I was heavily short of the entire market．

He said，“My God，Larry！I don't know what's going to happen．I never saw anything like it．It can't go on．Something has got to give．It looks to me as if everybody is busted right now．You can't sell stocks，and there is absolutely no money in there．”

“How do you mean？”I asked．

But what he answered was，“Did you ever hear of the classroom experiment of the mouse in a glass-bell when they begin to pump the air out of the bell？You can see the poor mouse breathe faster and faster，its sides heaving like overworked bellows，trying to get enough oxygen out of the decreasing supply in the bell．You watch it suffocate till its eyes almost pop out of their sockets，gasping，dying．Well，that is what I think of when I see the crowd at the Money Post！No money anywhere，and you can't liquidate stocks because there is nobody to buy them．The whole Street is broke at this very moment，if you ask me！”

It made me think．I had seen a smash coming，but not，I admit，the worst panic in our history．It might not be profitable to anybody—if it went much further．

Finally it became plain that there was no use in waiting at the Post for money．There wasn't going to be any．Then hell broke loose．

The president of the Stock Exchange，Mr．R．H．Thomas，so I heard later in the day，knowing that every house in the Street was headed for disaster，went out in search of succour．He called on James Stillman，president of the National City Bank，the richest bank in the United States．Its boast was that it never loaned money at a higher rate than 6 per cent．

Stillman heard what the president of the New York Stock Exchange had to say．Then he said，“Mr．Thomas，we'll have to go and see Mr．Morgan about this．”

The two men，hoping to stave off the most disastrous panic in our financial history，went together to the office of J．P．Morgan & Co．and saw Mr．Morgan．Mr．Thomas laid the case before him．The moment he got through speaking Mr．Morgan said，“Go back to the Exchange and tell them that there will be money for them．”

“Where？”

“At the banks！”

So strong was the faith of all men in Mr．Morgan in those critical times that Thomas didn't wait for further details but rushed back to the floor of the Exchange to announce the reprieve to his death-sentenced fellow members．

Then，before half past two in the afternoon，J．P．Morgan sent John T．Atterbury，of Van Emburgh & Atterbury，who was known to have close relations with J．P．Morgan & Co.，into the money crowd．My friend said that the old broker walked quickly to the Money Post．He raised his hand like an exhorter at a revival meeting．The crowd，that at first had been calmed down somewhat by President Thomas' announcement，was beginning to fear that the relief plans had miscarried and the worst was still to come．But when they looked at Mr．Atterbury's face and saw him raise his hand they promptly petrified themselves．

In the dead silence that followed，Mr．Atterbury said，“I am authorized to lend ten million dollars．Take it easy ！There will be enough for everybody！”

Then he began．Instead of giving to each borrower the name of the lender he simply jotted down the name of the borrower and the amount of the loan and told the borrower，“You will be told where your money is．”He meant the name of the bank from which the borrower would get the money later．

I heard a day or two later that Mr．Morgan simply sent word to the frightened bankers of New York that they must provide the money the Stock Exchange needed．

“But we haven't got any．We're loaned up to the hilt，”the banks protested．

“You've got your reserves，”snapped J．P．

“But we're already below the legal limit，”they howled．

“Use them！That's what reserves are for！”And the banks obeyed and invaded the reserves to the extent of about twenty million dollars．It saved the stock market．The bank panic didn't come until the following week．He was a man，J．P．Morgan was．They don't come much bigger．

That was the day I remember most vividly of all the days of my life as a stock operator．It was the day when my winnings exceeded one million dollars．It marked the successful ending of my first deliberately planned trading campaign．What I had foreseen had come to pass．But more than all these things was this：a wild dream of mine had been realised．I had been king for a day！

I'll explain，of course．After I had been in New York a couple of years I used to cudgel my brains trying to determine the exact reason why I couldn't beat in a Stock Exchange house in New York the game that I had beaten as a kid of fifteen in a bucket shop in Boston．I knew that some day I would find out what was wrong and I would stop being wrong．I would then have not alone the will to be right but the knowledge to insure my being right．And that would mean power．

Please do not misunderstand me．It was not a deliberate dream of grandeur or a futile desire born of overweening vanity．It was rather a sort of feeling that the same old stock market that so baffled me in Fullerton's office and in Harding's would one day eat out of my hand．I just felt that such a day would come．And it did—October 24，1907．

The reason why I say it is this：That morning a broker who had done a lot of business for my brokers and knew that I had been plunging on the bear side rode down in the company of one of the partners of the foremost banking house in the Street．My friend told the banker how heavily I had been trading，for I certainly pushed my luck to the limit．What is the use of being right unless you get all the good possible out of it？

Perhaps the broker exaggerated to make his story sound important．Perhaps I had more of a following than I knew．Perhaps the banker knew far better than I how critical the situation was．At all events，my friend said to me：“He listened with great interest to what I told him you said the market was going to do when the real selling began，after another push or two．When I got through he said he might have something for me to do later in the day．”

When the commission houses found out there was not a cent to be had at any price I knew the time had come．I sent brokers into the various crowds．Why，at one time there wasn't a single bid for Union Pacific．Not at any price！Think of it！And in other stocks the same thing．No money to hold stocks and nobody to buy them．

I had enormous paper profits and the certainty that all that I had to do to smash prices still more was to send in orders to sell ten thousand shares each of Union Pacific and of a half dozen other good dividend-paying stocks and what would follow would be simply hell．It seemed to me that the panic that would be precipitated would be of such an intensity and character that the board of governors would deem it advisable to close the Exchange，as was done in August，1914，when the World War broke out．

It would mean greatly increased profits on paper．It also mean an inability to convert those profits into actual cash．But there were other things to consider，and one was that a further break would retard the recovery that I was beginning to figure on，the compensating improvement after all that bloodletting．Such a panic would do much harm to the country generally．

I made up my mind that since it was unwise and unpleasant to continue actively bearish it was illogical for me to stay short．So I turned and began to buy．

It wasn't long after my brokers began to buy in for me—and，by the way，I got bottom prices—that the banker sent for my friend．

“I have sent for you，”he said，“because I want you to go instantly to your friend Livingston and say to him that we hope he will not sell any more stocks today．The market can't stand much more pressure．As it is，it will be an immensely difficult task to avert a devastating panic．Appeal to your friend's patriotism．This is a case where a man has to work for the benefit of all．Let me know at once what he says．”

My friend came right over and told me．He was very tactful．I suppose he thought that having planned to smash the market I would consider his request as equivalent to throwing away the chance to make about ten million dollars．He knew I was sore on some of the big guns for the way they had acted trying to land the public with a lot of stock when they knew as well as I did what was coming．

As a matter of fact，the big men were big sufferers and lots of the stocks I bought at the very bottom were in famous financial names．I didn't know it at the time，but it did not matter．I had practically covered all my shorts and it seemed to me there was a chance to buy stocks cheap and help the needed recovery in prices at the same time—if nobody hammered the market．

So I told my friend，“Go back and tell Mr．Blank that I agree with them and that I fully realised the gravity of the situation even before he sent for you．I not only will not sell any more stocks today，but I am going in and buy as much as I can carry．”And I kept my word．I bought one hundred thousand shares that day，for the long account．I did not sell another stock short for nine months．

That is why I said to friends that my dream had come true and that I had been king for a moment．The stock market at one time that day certainly was at the mercy of anybody who wanted to hammer it．I do not suffer from delusions of grandeur；in fact you know how I feel about being accused of raiding the market and about the way my operations are exaggerated by the gossip of the Street．

I came out of it in fine shape．The newspapers said that Larry Livingston，the Boy Plunger，had made several millions．Well，I was worth over one million after the close of business that day．But my biggest winnings were not in dollars but in the intangibles：I had learned what a man must do in order to make big money；I was permanently out of the gambler class；I had at last learned to trade intelligently in a big way．It was a day of days for me．





Chapter X


THE recognition of our own mistakes should not benefit us any more than the study of our successes．But there is a natural tendency in all men to avoid punishment．When you associate certain mistakes with a licking，you do not hanker for a second dose，and，of course，all stock-market mistakes wound you in two tender spots—your pocketbook and your vanity．But I will tell you something curious：A stock speculator sometimes makes mistakes and knows that he is making them．And after he makes them he will ask himself why he made them；and after thinking over it cold-bloodedly a long time after the pain of punishment is over he may learn how he came to make them，and when，and at what particular point of his trade；but not why．And then he simply calls himself names and lets it go at that．

Of course，if a man is both wise and lucky，he will not make the same mistake twice．But he will make any one of the ten thousand brothers or cousins of the original．The Mistake family is so large that there is always one of them around when you want to see what you can do in the fool-play line．

To tell you about the first of my million-dollar mistakes I shall have to go back to this time when I first became a millionaire，right after the big break of October，1907．As far as my trading went，having a million merely meant more reserves．Money does not give a trader more comfort，because，rich or poor，he can make mistakes and it is never comfortable to be wrong．And when a millionaire is right his money is merely one of his several servants．Losing money is the least of my troubles．A loss never bothers me after I take it．I forget it overnight．But being wrong—not taking the loss—that is what does the damage to the pocketbook and to the soul．You remember Dickson G．Watts' story about the man who was so nervous that a friend asked him what was the matter．

“I can't sleep，”answered the nervous one．

“Why not？”asked the friend．

“I am carrying so much cotton that I can't sleep thinking about it．It is wearing me out．What can I do？”

“Sell down to the sleeping point，”answered the friend．

As a rule a man adapts himself to conditions so quickly that he loses the perspective．He does not feel the difference much—that is，he does not vividly remember how it felt not to be a millionaire．He only remembers that there were things he could not do that he can do now．It does not take a reasonably young and normal man very long to lose the habit of being poor．It requires a little longer to forget that he used to be rich．I suppose that is because money creates needs or encourages their multiplication．I mean that after a man makes money in the stock market he very quickly loses the habit of not spending．But after he loses his money it takes him a long time to lose the habit of spending．

After I took in my shorts and went long in October，1907，I decided to take it easy for a while．I bought a yacht and planned to go off on a cruise in Southern waters．I am crazy about fishing and I was due to have the time of my life．I looked forward to it and expected to go any day．But I did not．The market wouldn't let me．

I always have traded in commodities as well as in stocks．I began as a youngster in the bucket shops．I studied those markets for years，though perhaps not so assiduously as the stock market．As a matter of fact，I would rather play commodities than stocks．There is no question about their greater legitimacy，as it were．It partakes more of the nature of a commercial venture than trading in stocks does．A man can approach it as he might any mercantile problem．It may be possible to use fictitious arguments for or against a certain trend in a commodity market；but success will be only temporary，for in the end the facts are bound to prevail，so that a trader gets dividends on study and observation，as he does in a regular business．He can watch and weigh conditions and he knows as much about it as anyone else．He need not guard against inside cliques．Dividends are not unexpectedly passed or increased overnight in the cotton market or in wheat or corn．In the long run commodity prices are governed but by one law—the economic law of demand and supply．The business of the trader in commodities is simply to get facts about the demand and the supply，present and prospective．He does not indulge in guesses about a dozen things as he does in stocks．It always appealed to me—trading in commodities．

Of course the same things happen in all speculative markets．The message of the tape is the same．That will be perfectly plain to anyone who will take the trouble to think．He will find if he asks himself questions and considers conditions，that the answers will supply themselves directly．But people never take the trouble to ask questions，leave alone seeking answers．The average American is from Missouri everywhere and at all times except when he goes to the brokers' offices and looks at the tape，whether it is stocks or commodities．The one game of all games that really requires study before making a play is the one he goes into without his usual highly intelligent preliminary and precautionary doubts．He will risk half his fortune in the stock market with less reflection than he devotes to the selection of a medium-priced automobile．

This matter of tape reading is not so complicated as it appears．Of course you need experience．But it is even more important to keep certain fundamentals in mind．To read the tape is not to have your fortune told．The tape does not tell you how much you will surely be worth next Thursday at 1：35 P．M．The object of reading the tape is to ascertain，first，how and，next，when to trade—that is，whether it is wiser to buy than to sell．It works exactly the same for stocks as for cotton or wheat or corn or oats．

You watch the market—that is，the course of prices as recorded by the tape—with one object：to determine the direction—that is，the price tendency．Prices，we know，will move either up or down according to the resistance they encounter．For purposes of easy explanation we will say that prices，like everything else，move along the line of least resistance．They will do whatever comes easiest，therefore they will go up if there is less resistance to an advance than to a decline；and vice versa．

Nobody should be puzzled as to whether a market is a bull or a bear market after it fairly starts．The trend is evident to a man who has an open mind and reasonably clear sight，for it is never wise for a speculator to fit his facts to his theories．Such a man will，or ought to，know whether it is a bull or a bear market，and if he knows that he knows whether to buy or to sell．It is therefore at the very inception of the movement that a man needs to know whether to buy or to sell．

Let us say，for example，that the market，as it usually does in those between-swings times，fluctuates within a range of ten points；up to 130 and down to 120．It may look very weak at the bottom；or，on the way up，after a rise of eight or ten points，it may look as strong as anything．A man ought not to be led into trading by tokens．He should wait until the tape tells him that the time is ripe．As a matter of fact，millions upon millions of dollars have been lost by men who bought stocks because they looked cheap or sold them because they looked dear．The speculator is not an investor．His object is not to secure a steady return on his money at a good rate of interest，but to profit by either a rise or a fall in the price of whatever he may be speculating in．Therefore the thing to determine is the speculative line of least resistance at the moment of trading；and what he should wait for is the moment when that line defines itself，because that is his signal to get busy．

Reading the tape merely enables him to see that at 130 the selling had been stronger than the buying and a reaction in the price logically followed．Up to the point where the selling prevailed over the buying，superficial students of the tape may conclude that the price is not going to stop short of 150，and they buy．But after the reaction begins they hold on，or sell out at a small loss，or they go short and talk bearish．But at 120 there is stronger resistance to the decline．The buying prevails over the selling，there is a rally and the shorts cover．The public is so often whipsawed that one marvels at their persistence in not learning their lesson．

Eventually something happens that increases the power of either the upward or the downward force and the point of greatest resistance moves up or down—that is，the buying at 130 will for the first time be stronger than the selling，or the selling at 120 be stronger than the buying．The price will break through the old barrier or movement-limit and go on．As a rule，there is always a crowd of traders who are short at 120 because it looked so weak，or long at 130 because it looked so strong，and，when the market goes against them they are forced，after a while，either to change their minds and turn or to close out．In either event they help to define even more clearly the price line of least resistance．Thus the intelligent trader who has patiently waited to determine this line will enlist the aid of fundamental trade conditions and also of the force of the trading of that part of the community that happened to guess wrong and must now rectify mistakes．Such corrections tend to push prices along the line of least resistance．

And right here I will say that，though I do not give it as a mathematical certainty or as an axiom of speculation，my experience has been that accidents—that is，the unexpected or unforeseen—have always helped me in my market position whenever the latter has been based upon my determination of the line of least resistance．Do you remember that Union Pacific episode at Saratoga that I told you about？Well，I was long because I found out that the line of least resistance was upward．I should have stayed long instead of letting my broker tell me that insiders were selling stocks．It didn't make any difference what was going on in the directors' minds．That was something I couldn't possibly know．But I could and did know that the tape said：“Going up！”And then came the unexpected raising of the dividend rate and the thirty point rise in the stock．At 164 prices looked mighty high，but as I told you before，stocks are never too high to buy or too low to sell．The price，per se，has nothing to do with establishing my line of least resistance．

You will find in actual practice that if you trade as I have indicated any important piece of news given out between the closing of one market and the opening of another is usually in harmony with the line of least resistance．The trend has been established before the news is published，and in bull markets bear items are ignored and bull news exaggerated，and vice versa．Before the war broke out the market was in a very weak condition．There came the proclamation of Germany's submarine policy．I was short one hundred and fifty thousand shares of stock，not because I knew the news was coming，but because I was going along the line of least resistance．What happened came out of a clear sky，as far as my play was concerned．Of course I took advantage of the situation and I covered my shorts that day．

It sounds very easy to say that all you have to do is to watch the tape，establish your resistance points and be ready to trade along the line of least resistance as soon as you have determined it．But in actual practice a man has to guard against many things，and most of all against himself—that is，against human nature．That is the reason why I say that the man who is right always has two forces working in his favor—basic conditions and the men who are wrong．In a bull market bear factors are ignored．That is human nature，and yet human beings profess astonishment at it．People will tell you that the wheat crop has gone to pot because there has been bad weather in one or two sections and some farmers have been ruined．When the entire crop is gathered and all the farmers in all the wheat-growing sections begin to take their wheat to the elevators the bulls are surprised at the smallness of the damage．They discover that they merely have helped the bears．

When a man makes his play in a commodity market he must not permit himself set opinions．He must have an open mind and flexibility．It is not wise to disregard the message of the tape，no matter what your opinion of crop conditions or of the probable demand may be．I recall how I missed a big play just by trying to anticipate the starting signal．I felt so sure of conditions that I thought it was not necessary to wait for the line of least resistance to define itself．I even thought I might help it arrive，because it looked as if it merely needed a little assistance．

I was very bullish on cotton．It was hanging around twelve cents，running up and down within a moderate range．It was in one of those in-between places and I could see it．I knew I really ought to wait．But I got to thinking that if I gave it a little push it would go beyond the upper resistance point．

I bought fifty thousand bales．Sure enough，it moved up．And sure enough，as soon as I stopped buying it stopped going up．Then it began to settle back to where it was when I began buying it．I got out and it stopped going down．I thought I was now much nearer the starting signal，and presently I thought I'd start it myself again．I did．The same thing happened．I bid it up，only to see it go down when I stopped．I did this four or five times until I finally quit in disgust．It cost me about two hundred thousand dollars．I was done with it．It wasn't very long after that when it began to go up and never stopped till it got to a price that would have meant a killing for me—if I hadn't been in such a great hurry to start．

This experience has been the experience of so many traders so many times that I can give this rule：In a narrow market，when prices are not getting anywhere to speak of but move within a narrow range，there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be—up or down．The thing to do is to watch the market，read the tape to determine the limits of the get-nowhere prices，and make up your mind that you will not take an interest until the price breaks through the limit in either direction．A speculator must concern himself with making money out of the market and not with insisting that the tape must agree with him．Never argue with it or ask it for reasons or explanations．Stock-market post-mortems don't pay dividends．

Not so long ago I was with a party of friends．They got to talking wheat．Some of them were bullish and others bearish．Finally they asked me what I thought．Well，I had been studying the market for some time．I knew they did not want any statistics or analyses of conditions．So I said：“If you want to make some money out of wheat I can tell you how to do it．”

They all said they did and I told them，“If you are sure you wish to make money in wheat just you watch it．Wait．The moment it crosses $1.20 buy it and you will get a nice quick play in it！”

“Why not buy it now，at $1.14？”one of the party asked．

“Because I don't know yet that it is going up at all．”

“Then why buy it at $1.20？It seems a mighty high price．”

“Do you wish to gamble blindly in the hope of getting a great big profit or do you wish to speculate intelligently and get a smaller but much more probable profit？”

They all said they wanted the smaller but surer profit，so I said，“Then do as I tell you．If it crosses $1.20 buy．”

As I told you，I had watched it a long time．For months it sold between $1.10 and $1.20，getting nowhere in particular．Well，sir，one day it closed at above $1.I9．I got ready for it．Sure enough the next day it opened at $1.20½，and I bought．It went to $1.21，to $1.22，to $1.23，to $1.25，and I went with it．

Now I couldn't have told you at the time just what was going on．I didn't get any explanations about its behaviour during the course of the limited fluctuations．I couldn't tell whether the breaking through the limit would be up through $1.20 or down through $1.10，though I suspected it would be up because there was not enough wheat in the world for a big break in prices．

As a matter of fact，it seems Europe had been buying quietly and a lot of traders had gone short of it at around $1.19．Owing to the European purchases and other causes，a lot of wheat had been taken out of the market，so that finally the big movement got started．The price went beyond the $1.20 mark．That was all the point I had and it was all I needed．I knew that when it crossed $1.20 it would be because the upward movement at last had gathered force to push it over the limit and something had to happen．In other words，by crossing $1.20 the line of least resistance of wheat prices was established．It was a different story then．

I remember that one day was a holiday with us and all our markets were closed．Well，in Winnipeg wheat opened up six cents a bushel．When our market opened on the following day，it also was up six cents a bushel．The price just went along the line of least resistance．

What I have told you gives you the essence of my trading system as based on studying the tape．I merely learn the way prices are most probably going to move．I check up my own trading by additional tests，to determine the psychological moment．I do that by watching the way the price acts after I begin．

It is surprising how many experienced traders there are who look incredulous when I tell them that when I buy stocks for a rise I like to pay top prices and when I sell I must sell low or not at all．It would not be so difficult to make money if a trader always stuck to his speculative guns—that is，waited for the line of least resistance to define itself and began buying only when the tape said up or selling only when it said down．He should accumulate his line on the way up．Let him buy one-fifth of his full line．If that does not show him a profit he must not increase his holdings because he has obviously begun wrong；he is wrong temporarily and there is no profit in being wrong at any time．The same tape that said UP did not necessarily lie merely because it is now saying NOT YET．

In cotton I was very successful in my trading for a long time．I had my theory about it and I absolutely lived up to it．Suppose I had decided that my line would be forty to fifty thousand bales．Well，I would study the tape as I told you，watching for an opportunity either to buy or to sell．Suppose the line of least resistance indicated a bull movement．Well，I would buy ten thousand bales．After I got through buying that，if the market went up ten points over my initial purchase price，I would take on another ten thousand bales．Same thing．Then，if I could get twenty points' profit，or one dollar a bale，I would buy twenty thousand more．That would give me my line—my basis for my trading．But if after buying the first ten or twenty thousand bales，it showed me a loss，out I'd go．I was wrong．It might be I was only temporarily wrong．But as I have said before it doesn't pay to start wrong in anything．

What I accomplished by sticking to my system was that I always had a line of cotton in every real movement．In the course of accumulating my full line I might chip out fifty or sixty thousand dollars in these feeling-out plays of mine．This looks like a very expensive testing，but it wasn't．After the real movement started，how long would it take me to make up the fifty thousand dollars I had dropped in order to make sure that I began to load up at exactly the right time？No time at all！It always pays a man to be right at the right time．

As I think I also said before，this describes what I may call my system for placing my bets．It is simple arithmetic to prove that it is a wise thing to have the big bet down only when you win，and when you lose to lose only a small exploratory bet，as it were．If a man trades in the way I have described，he will always be in the profitable position of being able to cash in on the big bet．

Professional traders have always had some system or other based upon their experience and governed either by their attitude toward speculation or by their desires．I remember I met an old gentleman in Palm Beach whose name I did not catch or did not at once identify．I knew he had been in the Street for years，way back in Civil War times，and somebody told me that he was a very wise old codger who had gone through so many booms and panics that he was always saying there was nothing new under the sun and least of all in the stock market．

The old fellow asked me a lot of questions．When I got through telling him about my usual practice in trading he nodded and said，“Yes！Yes！You're right．The way you're built，the way your mind runs，makes your system a good system for you．It comes easy for you to practice what you preach，because the money you bet is the least of your cares．I recollect Pat Hearne．Ever hear of him？Well，he was a very well-known sporting man and he had an account with us．Clever chap and nervy．He made money in stocks，and that made people ask him for advice．He would never give any．If they asked him point-blank for his opinion about the wisdom of their commitments he used a favourite race-track maxim of his：“You can't tell till you bet．”He traded in our office．He would buy one hundred shares of some active stock and when，or if，it went up 1 per cent he would buy another hundred．On another point's advance，another hundred shares；and so on．He used to say he wasn't playing the game to make money for others and therefore he would put in a stop-loss order one point below the price of his last purchase．When the price kept going up he simply moved up his stop with it．On a 1 per cent reaction he was stopped out．He declared he did not see any sense in losing more than one point，whether it came out of his original margin or out of his paper profits．

“You know，a professional gambler is not looking for long shots，but for sure money．Of course long shots are fine when they come in．In the stock market Pat wasn't after tips or playing to catch twenty-points-a-week advances，but sure money in sufficient quantity to provide him with a good living．Of all the thousands of outsiders that I have run across in Wall Street，Pat Hearne was the only one who saw in stock speculation merely a game of chance like faro or roulette，but，nevertheless，had the sense to stick to a relatively sound betting method．

“After Hearne's death one of our customers who had always traded with Pat and used his system made over one hundred thousand dollars in Lackawanna．Then he switched over to some other stock and because he had made a big stake he thought he need not stick to Pat's way．When a reaction came，instead of cutting short his losses he let them run—as though they were profits．Of course every cent went．When he finally quit he owed us several thousand dollars．

“He hung around for two or three years．He kept the fever long after the cash had gone；but we did not object as long as he behaved himself．I remember that he used to admit freely that he had been ten thousand kinds of an ass not to stick to Pat Hearne's style of play．Well，one day he came to me greatly excited and asked me to let him sell some stock short in our office．He was a nice enough chap who had been a good customer in his day and I told him I personally would guarantee his account for one hundred shares．

“He sold short one hundred shares of Lake Shore．That was the time Bill Travers hammered the market，in 1875．My friend Roberts put out that Lake Shore at exactly the right time and kept selling it on the way down as he had been wont to do in the old successful days before he forsook Pat Hearne's system and instead listened to hope's whispers．

“Well，sir，in four days of successful pyramiding，Roberts' account showed him a profit of fifteen thousand dollars．Observing that he had not put in a stop-loss order I spoke to him about it and he told me that the break hadn't fairly begun and he wasn't going to be shaken out by any one-point reaction．This was in August．Before the middle of September he borrowed ten dollars from me for a baby carriage—his fourth．He did not stick to his own proved system．That's the trouble with most of them，”and the old fellow shook his head at me．

And he was right．I sometimes think that speculation must be an unnatural sort of business，because I find that the average speculator has arrayed against him his own nature．The weaknesses that all men are prone to are fatal to success in speculation—usually those very weaknesses that make him likable to his fellows or that he himself particularly guards against in those other ventures of his where they are not nearly so dangerous as when he is trading in stocks or commodities．

The speculator's chief enemies are always boring from within．It is inseparable from human nature to hope and to fear．In speculation when the market goes against you you hope that every day will be the last day—and you lose more than you should had you not listened to hope—to the same ally that is so potent a success-bringer to empire builders and pioneers，big and little．And when the market goes your way you become fearful that the next day will take away your profit，and you get out—too soon．Fear keeps you from making as much money as you ought to．The successful trader has to fight these two deep-seated instincts．He has to reverse what you might call his natural impulses．Instead of hoping he must fear；instead of fearing he must hope．He must fear that his loss may develop into a much bigger loss，and hope that his profit may become a big profit．It is absolutely wrong to gamble in stocks the way the average man does．

I have been in the speculative game ever since I was fourteen．It is all I have ever done．I think I know what I am talking about．And the conclusion that I have reached after nearly thirty years of constant trading，both on a shoestring and with millions of dollars back of me，is this：A man may beat a stock or a group at a certain time，but no man living can beat the stock market！A man may make money out of individual deals in cotton or grain，but no man can beat the cotton market or the grain market．It's like the track．A man may beat a horse race，but he cannot beat horse racing．

If I knew how to make these statements stronger or more emphatic I certainly would．It does not make any difference what anybody says to the contrary．I know I am right in saying these are incontrovertible statements．





Chapter XI


AND now I'll get back to October，1907．I bought a yacht and made all preparations to leave New York for a cruise in Southern waters．I am really daffy about fishing and this was the time when I was going to fish to my heart's content from my own yacht，going wherever I wished whenever I felt like it．Everything was ready．I had made a killing in stocks，but at the last moment corn held me back．

I must explain that before the money panic which gave me my first million I had been trading in grain at Chicago．I was short ten million bushels of wheat and ten million bushels of corn．I had studied the grain markets for a long time and was as bearish on corn and wheat as I had been on stocks．

Well，they both started down，but while wheat kept on declining the biggest of all the Chicago operators—I'll call him Stratton—took it into his head to run a corner in corn．After I cleaned up in stocks and was ready to go South on my yacht I found that wheat showed me a handsome profit，but in corn Stratton had run up the price and I had quite a loss．

I knew there was much more corn in the country than the price indicated．The law of demand and supply worked as always．But the demand came chiefly from Stratton and the supply was not coming at all，because there was an acute congestion in the movement of corn．I remember that I used to pray for a cold spell that would freeze the impassable roads and enable the farmers to bring their corn into the market．But no such luck．

There I was，waiting to go on my joyously planned fishing trip and that loss in corn holding me back．I couldn't go away with the market as it was．Of course Stratton kept pretty close tabs on the short interest．He knew he had me，and I knew it quite as well as he did．But，as I said，I was hoping I might convince the weather that it ought to get busy and help me．Perceiving that neither the weather nor any other kindly wonder-worker was paying any attention to my needs I studied how I might work out of my difficulty by my own efforts．

I closed out my line of wheat at a good profit．But the problem in corn was infinitely more difficult．If I could have covered my ten million bushels at the prevailing prices I instantly and gladly would have done so，large though the loss would have been．But，of course，the moment I started to buy in my corn Stratton would be on the job as squeezer in chief，and I no more relished running up the price on myself by reason of my own purchases than cutting my own throat with my own knife．

Strong though corn was，my desire to go fishing was even stronger，so it was up to me to find a way out at once．I must conduct a strategic retreat．I must buy back the ten million bushels I was short of and in so doing keep down my loss as much as I possibly could．

It so happened that Stratton at that time was also running a deal in oats and had the market pretty well sewed up．I had kept track of all the grain markets in the way of crop news and pit gossip，and I heard that the powerful Armour interests were not friendly，marketwise，to Stratton．Of course I knew that Stratton would not let me have the corn I needed except at his own price，but the moment I heard the rumors about Armour being against Stratton it occurred to me that I might look to the Chicago traders for aid．The only way in which they could possibly help me was for them to sell me the corn that Stratton wouldn't．The rest was easy．

First，I put in orders to buy five hundred thousand bushels of corn every eighth of a cent down．After these orders were in I gave to each of four houses an order to sell simultaneously fifty thousand bushels of oats at the market．That，I figured，ought to make a quick break in oats．Knowing how the traders' minds worked，it was a cinch that they would instantly think that Armour was gunning for Stratton．Seeing the attack opened in oats they would logically conclude that the next break would be in corn and they would start to sell it．If that corner in corn was busted，the pickings would be fabulous．

My dope on the psychology of the Chicago traders was absolutely correct．When they saw oats breaking on the scattered selling they promptly jumped on corn and sold it with great enthusiasm．I was able to buy six million bushels of corn in the next ten minutes．The moment I found that their selling of corn ceased I simply bought in the other four million bushels at the market．Of course that made the price go up again，but the net result of my manoeuvre was that I covered the entire line of ten million bushels within one-half cent of the price prevailing at the time I started to cover on the traders' selling．The two hundred thousand bushels of oats that I sold short to start the traders' selling of corn I covered at a loss of only three thousand dollars．That was pretty cheap bear bait．The profits I had made in wheat offset so much of my deficit in corn that my total loss on all my grain trades that time was only twenty-five thousand dollars．Afterwards corn went up twenty-five cents a bushed．Stratton undoubtedly had me at his mercy．If I had set about buying my ten million bushels of corn without bothering to think of the price there is no telling what I would have had to pay．

A man can't spend years at one thing and not acquire a habitual attitude towards it quite unlike that of the average beginner．The difference distinguishes the professional from the amateur．It is the way a man looks at things that makes or loses money for him in the speculative markets．The public has the dilettante's point of view toward his own effort．The ego obtrudes itself unduly and the thinking therefore is not deep or exhaustive．The professional concerns himself with doing the right thing rather than with making money，knowing that the profit takes care of itself if the other things are attended to．A trader gets to play the game as the professional billiard player does—that is，he looks far ahead instead of considering the particular shot before him．It gets to be an instinct to play for position．

I remember hearing a story about Addison Cammack that illustrates very nicely what I wish to point out．From all I have heard，I am inclined to think that Cammack was one of the ablest stock traders the Street ever saw．He was not a chronic bear as many believe，but he felt the greater appeal of trading on the bear side，of utilising in his behalf the two great human factors of hope and fear．He is credited with coining the warning：“Don't sell stocks when the sap is running up the trees！”and the old-timers tell me that his biggest winnings were made on the bull side，so that it is plain he did not play prejudices but conditions．At all events，he was a consummate trader．It seems that once—this was way back at the tag end of a bull market—Cammack was bearish，and J．Arthur Joseph，the financial writer and raconteur，knew it．The market，however，was not only strong but still rising，in response to prodding by the bull leaders and optimistic reports by the newspapers．Knowing what use a trader like Cammack could make of bearish information，Joseph rushed to Cammack's office one day with glad tidings．

“Mr．Cammack，I have a very good friend who is a transfer clerk in the St．Paul office and he has just told me something which I think you ought to know．”

“What is it？”asked Cammack listlessly．

“You've turned，haven't you？You are bearish now？”asked Joseph，to make sure．If Cammack wasn't interested he wasn't going to waste precious ammunition．

“Yes．What's the wonderful information？”

“I went around to the St．Paul office today，as I do in my news-gathering rounds two or three times a week，and my friend there said to me：‘The Old Man is selling stock．’He meant William Rockefeller．‘Is he really，Jimmy？’I said to him，and he answered，‘Yes；he is selling fifteen hundred shares every three-eighths of a point up．I've been transferring the stock for two or three days now．’I didn't lose any time，but came right over to tell you．”

Cammack was not easily excited，and，moreover，was so accustomed to having all manner of people rush madly into his office with all manner of news，gossip，rumors，tips and lies that he had grown distrustful of them all．He merely said now，“Are you sure you heard right，Joseph？”

“Am I sure？Certainly I am sure！Do you think I am deaf？”said Joseph．

“Are you sure of your man？”

“Absolutely！”declared Joseph．“I've known him for years．He has never lied to me．He wouldn't！No object！I know he is absolutely reliable and I'd stake my life on what he tells me．I know him as well as I know anybody in this world—a great deal better than you seem to know me，after all these years．”

“Sure of him，eh？”And Cammack again looked at Joseph．Then he said，“Well，you ought to know．”He called his broker，W．B．Wheeler．Joseph expected to hear him give an order to sell at least fifty thousand shares of St．Paul．William Rockefeller was disposing of his holdings in St．Paul，taking advantage of the strength of the market．Whether it was investment stock or speculative holdings was irrelevant．The one important fact was that the best stock trader of the Standard Oil crowd was getting out of St．Paul．What would the average man have done if he had received the news from a trustworthy source？No need to ask．

But Cammack，the ablest bear operator of his day，who was bearish on the market just then，said to his broker，“Billy，go over to the board and buy fifteen hundred St．Paul every three-eighths up．”The stock was then in the nineties．

“Don't you mean sell？”interjected Joseph hastily．He was no novice in Wall Street，but he was thinking of the market from the point of view of the newspaper man and，incidentally，of the general public．The price certainly ought to go down on the news of inside selling．And there was no better inside selling than Mr．William Rockefeller's．The Standard Oil getting out and Cammack buying！It couldn't be！

“No，”said Cammack；“I mean buy！”

“Don't you believe me？”

“Yes ！”

“Don't you believe my information？”

“Yes．”

“Aren't you bearish？”

“Yes．”

“Well，then？”

“That's why I'm buying．Listen to me now：You keep in touch with that reliable friend of yours and the moment the scaled selling stops，let me know．Instantly！Do you understand？”

“Yes，”said Joseph，and went away，not quite sure he could fathom Cammack's motives in buying William Rockefeller's stock．It was the knowledge that Cammack was bearish on the entire market that made his manoeuvre so difficult to explain．However，Joseph saw his friend the transfer clerk and told him he wanted to be tipped off when the Old Man got through selling．Regularly twice a day Joseph called on his friend to inquire．

One day the transfer clerk told him，“There isn't any more stock coming from the Old Man．”Joseph thanked him and ran to Cammack's office with the information．

Cammack listened attentively，turned to Wheeler and asked，“Billy，how much St．Paul have we got in the office？”Wheeler looked it up and reported that they had accumulated about sixty thousand shares．

Cammack，being bearish，had been putting out short lines in the other Grangers as well as in various other stocks，even before he began to buy St．Paul．He was now heavily short of the market．He promptly ordered Wheeler to sell the sixty thousand shares of St．Paul that they were long of，and more besides．He used his long holdings of St．Paul as a lever to depress the general list and greatly benefit his operations for a decline．

St．Paul didn't stop on that move until it reached forty-four and Cammack made a killing in it．He played his cards with consummate skill and profited accordingly．The point I would make is his habitual attitude toward trading．He didn't have to reflect．He saw instantly what was far more important to him than his profit on that one stock．He saw that he had providentially been offered an opportunity to begin his big bear operations not only at the proper time but with a proper initial push．The St．Paul tip made him buy instead of sell because he saw at once that it gave him a vast supply of the best ammunition for his bear campaign．

To get back to myself．After I closed my trade in wheat and corn I went South in my yacht．I cruised about in Florida waters，having a grand old time．The fishing was great．Everything was lovely．I didn't have a care in the world and I wasn't looking for any．

One day I went ashore at Palm Beach．I met a lot of Wall Street friends and others．They were all talking about the most picturesque cotton speculator of the day．A report from New York had it that Percy Thomas had lost every cent．It wasn't a commercial bankruptcy；merely the rumor of the world-famous operator's second Waterloo in the cotton market．

I had always felt a great admiration for him．The first I ever heard of him was through the newspapers at the time of the failure of the Stock Exchange house of Sheldon & Thomas，when Thomas tried to corner cotton．Sheldon，who did not have the vision or the courage of his partner，got cold feet on the very verge of success．At least，so the Street said at the time．At all events，instead of making a killing they made one of the most sensational failures in years．I forget how many millions．The firm was wound up and Thomas went to work alone．He devoted himself exclusively to cotton and it was not long before he was on his feet again．He paid off his creditors in full with interest—debts he was not legally obliged to discharge—and withal had a million dollars left for himself．His comeback in the cotton market was in its way as remarkable as Deacon S．V．White's famous stock-market exploit of paying off one million dollars in one year．Thomas' pluck and brains made me admire him immensely．

Everybody in Palm Beach was talking about the collapse of Thomas' deal in March cotton．You know how the talk goes—and grows；the amount of misinformation and exaggeration and improvements that you hear．Why，I've seen a rumor about myself grow so that the fellow who started it did not recognise it when it came back to him in less than twenty-four hours，swollen with new and picturesque details．

The news of Percy Thomas' latest misadventure turned my mind from the fishing to the cotton market．I got files of the trade papers and read them to get a line on conditions．When I got back to New York I gave myself up to studying the market．Everybody was bearish and everybody was selling July cotton．You know how people are．I suppose it is the contagion of example that makes a man do something because everybody around him is doing the same thing．Perhaps it is some phase or variety of the herd instinct．In any case it was，in the opinion of hundreds of traders，the wise and proper thing to sell July cotton—and so safe too！You couldn't call that general selling reckless；the word is too conservative．The traders simply saw one side to the market and a great big profit．They certainly expected a collapse in prices．

I saw all this，of course，and it struck me that the chaps who were short didn't have a terrible lot of time to cover in．The more I studied the situation the clearer I saw this，until I finally decided to buy July cotton．I went to work and quickly bought one hundred thousand bales．I experienced no trouble in getting it because it came from so many sellers．It seemed to me that I could have offered a reward of one million dollars for the capture，dead or alive，of a single trader who was not selling July cotton and nobody would have claimed it．

I should say this was in the latter part of May．I kept buying more and they kept on selling it to me until I had picked up all the floating contracts and I had one hundred and twenty thousand bales．A couple of days after I had bought the last of it it began to go up．Once it started the market was kind enough to keep on doing very well indeed—that is，it went up from forty to fifty points a day．

One Saturday—this was about ten days after I began operations—the price began to creep up．I did not know whether there was any more July cotton for sale．It was up to me to find out，so I waited until the last ten minutes．At that time，I knew，it was usual for those fellows to be short and if the market closed up for the day they would be safely hooked．So I sent in four different orders to buy five thousand bales each，at the market，at the same time．That ran the price up thirty points and the shorts were doing their best to wriggle away．The market closed at the top．All I did，remember，was to buy that last twenty thousand bales．

The next day was Sunday．But on Monday，Liverpool was due to open up twenty points to be on a parity with the advance in New York．Instead，it came fifty points higher．That meant that Liverpool had exceeded our advance by 100 per cent．I had nothing to do with the rise in that market．This showed me that my deductions had been sound and that I was trading along the line of least resistance．At the same time I was not losing sight of the fact that I had a whopping big line to dispose of．A market may advance sharply or rise gradually and yet not possess the power to absorb more than a certain amount of selling．

Of course the Liverpool cables made our own market wild．But I noticed the higher it went the scarcer July cotton seemed to be．I wasn't letting go any of mine．Altogether that Monday was an exciting and not very cheerful day for the bears；but for all that，I could detect no signs of an impending bear panic；no beginnings of a blind stampede to cover．And I had one hundred and forty thousand bales for which I must find a market．

On Tuesday morning as I was walking to my office I met a friend at the entrance of the building．

“That was quite a story in the World this morning，”he said with a smile．

“What story？”I asked．

“What？Do you mean to tell me you haven't seen it？”

“I never see the World，”I said．“What is the story？”

“Why，it's all about you．It says you've got July cotton cornered．”

“I haven't seen it，”I told him and left him．I don't know whether he believed me or not．He probably thought it was highly inconsiderate of me not to tell him whether it was true or not．

When I got to the office I sent out for a copy of the paper．Sure enough，there it was，on the front page，in big headlines：

JULY COTTON CORNERED BY LARRY LIVINGSTON

Of course I knew at once that the article would play the dickens with the market．If I had deliberately studied ways and means of disposing of my one hundred and forty thousand bales to the best advantage I couldn't have hit upon a better plan．It would not have been possible to find one．That article at that very moment was being read all over the country either in the World or in other papers quoting it．It had been cabled to Europe．That was plain from the Liverpool prices．That market was simply wild．No wonder，with such news．

Of course I knew what New York would do，and what I ought to do．The market here opened at ten o'clock．At ten minutes after ten I did not own any cotton．I let them have every one of my one hundred and forty thousand bales．For most of my line I received what proved to be the top prices of the day．The traders made the market for me．All I really did was to see a heaven-sent opportunity to get rid of my cotton．I grasped it because I couldn't help it．What else could I do？

The problem that I knew would take a great deal of hard thinking to solve was thus solved for me by an accident．If the World had not published that article I never would have been able to dispose of my line without sacrificing the greater portion of my paper profits．Selling one hundred and forty thousand bales of July cotton without sending the price down was a trick beyond my powers．But the World story turned it for me very nicely．

Why the World published it I cannot tell you．I never knew．I suppose the writer was tipped off by some friend in the cotton market and he thought he was printing a scoop．I didn't see him or anybody from the World．I didn't know it was printed that morning until after nine o'clock；and if it had not been for my friend calling my attention to it I would not have known it then．

Without it I wouldn't have had a market big enough to unload in．That is one trouble about trading on a large scale．You cannot sneak out as you can when you pike along．You cannot always sell out when you wish or when you think it wise．You have to get out when you can；when you have a market that will absorb your entire line．Failure to grasp the opportunity to get out may cost you millions．You cannot hesitate．If you do you are lost．Neither can you try stunts like running up the price on the bears by means of competitive buying，for you may thereby reduce the absorbing capacity．And I want to tell you that perceiving your opportunity is not as easy as it sounds．A man must be on the lookout so alertly that when his chance sticks in its head at his door he must grab it．

Of course not everybody knew about my fortunate accident．In Wall Street，and，for that matter，everywhere else，any accident that makes big money for a man is regarded with suspicion．When the accident is unprofitable it is never considered an accident but the logical outcome of your hoggishness or of the swelled head．But when there is a profit they call it loot and talk about how well unscrupulousness fares，and how ill conservatism and decency．

It was not only the evil-minded shorts smarting under punishment brought about by their own recklessness who accused me of having deliberately planned the coup．Other people thought the same thing．

One of the biggest men in cotton in the entire world met me a day or two later and said，“That was certainly the slickest deal you ever put over，Livingston．I was wondering how much you were going to lose when you came to market that line of yours．You knew this market was not big enough to take more than fifty or sixty thousand bales without selling off，and how you were going to work off the rest and not lose all your paper profits was beginning to interest me．I didn't think of your scheme．It certainly was slick．”

“I had nothing to do with it，”I assured him as earnestly as I could．

But all he did was to repeat：“Mighty slick，my boy．Mighty slick！Don't be so modest！”

It was after that deal that some of the papers referred to me as the Cotton King．But，as I said，I really was not entitled to that crown．It is not necessary to tell you that there is not enough money in the United States to buy the columns of the New York World or enough personal pull to secure the publication of a story like that．It gave me an utterly unearned reputation that time．

But I have not told this story to moralize on the crowns that are sometimes pressed down upon the brows of undeserving traders or to emphasize the need of seizing the opportunity，no matter when or how it comes．My object merely was to account for the vast amount of newspaper notoriety that came to me as the result of my deal in July cotton．If it hadn't been for the newspapers I never would have met that remarkable man，Percy Thomas．





Chapter XII


NOT long after I closed my July cotton deal more successfully than I had expected I received by mail a request for an interview．The letter was signed by Percy Thomas．Of course I immediately answered that I'd be glad to see him at my office at any time he cared to call．The next day he came．

I had long admired him．His name was a household word wherever men took an interest in growing or buying or selling cotton．In Europe as well as all over this country people quoted Percy Thomas' opinions to me．I remember once at a Swiss resort talking to a Cairo banker who was interested in cotton growing in Egypt in association with the late Sir Ernest Cassel．When he heard I was from New York he immediately asked me about Percy Thomas，whose market reports he received and read with unfailing regularity．

Thomas，I always thought，went about his business scientifically．He was a true speculator，a thinker with the vision of a dreamer and the courage of a fighting man—an unusually well-informed man，who knew both the theory and the practice of trading in cotton．He loved to hear and to express ideas and theories and abstractions，and at the same time there was mighty little about the practical side of the cotton market or the psychology of cotton traders that he did not know，for he had been trading for years and had made and lost vast sums．

After the failure of his old Stock Exchange firm of Sheldon & Thomas he went it alone．Inside of two years he came back，almost spectacularly．I remember reading in the Sun that the first thing he did when he got on his feet financially was to pay off his old creditors in full，and the next was to hire an expert to study and determine for him how he had best invest a million dollars．This expert examined the properties and analysed the reports of several companies and then recommended the purchase of Delaware & Hudson stock．

Well，after having failed for millions and having come back with more millions，Thomas was cleaned out as the result of his deal in March cotton．There wasn't much time wasted after he came to see me．He proposed that we form a working alliance．Whatever information he got he would immediately turn over to me before passing it on to the public．My part would be to do the actual trading，for which he said I had a special genius and he hadn't．

That did not appeal to me for a number of reasons．I told him frankly that I did not think I could run in double harness and wasn't keen about trying to learn．But he insisted that it would be an ideal combination until I said flatly that I did not want to have anything to do with influencing other people to trade．

“If I fool myself，”I told him，“I alone suffer and I pay the bill at once．There are no drawn-out payments or unexpected annoyances．I play a lone hand by choice and also because it is the wisest and cheapest way to trade．I get my pleasure out of matching my brains against the brains of other traders—men whom I have never seen and never talked to and never advised to buy or sell and never expect to meet or know．When I make money I make it backing my own opinions．I don't sell them or capitalise them．If I made money in any other way I would imagine I had not earned it．Your proposition does not interest me because I am interested in the game only as I play it for myself and in my own way．”

He said he was sorry I felt the way I did，and tried to convince me that I was wrong in rejecting his plan．But I stuck to my views．The rest was a pleasant talk．I told him I knew he would“come back”and that I would consider it a privilege if he would allow me to be of financial assistance to him．But he said he could not accept any loans from me．Then he asked me about my July deal and I told him all about it；how I had gone into it and how much cotton I bought and the price and other details．We chatted a little more and then he went away．

When I said to you some time ago that a speculator has a host of enemies，many of whom successfully bore from within，I had in mind my many mistakes．I have learned that a man may possess an original mind and a lifelong habit of independent thinking and withal be vulnerable to attacks by a persuasive personality．I am fairly immune from the commoner speculative ailments，such as greed and fear and hope．But being an ordinary man I find I can err with great ease．

I ought to have been on my guard at this particular time because not long before that I had had an experience that proved how easily a man may be talked into doing something against his judgment and even against his wishes．It happened in Harding's office．I had a sort of private office—a room that they let me occupy by myself—and nobody was supposed to get to me during market hours without my consent．I didn't wish to be bothered and，as I was trading on a very large scale and my account was fairly profitable，I was pretty well guarded．

One day just after the market closed I heard somebody say，“Good afternoon，Mr．Livingston．”

I turned and saw an utter stranger—a chap of about thirty or thirty-five．I could not understand how he'd got in，but there he was．I concluded his business with me had passed him．But I didn't say anything．I just looked at him and pretty soon he said，“I came to see you about that Walter Scott，”and he was off．

He was a book agent．Now，he was not particularly pleasing of manner or skillful of speech．Neither was he especially attractive to look at．But he certainly had personality．He talked and I thought I listened．But I do not know what he said．I don't think I ever knew，not even at the time．When he finished his monologue he handed me first his fountain pen and then a blank form，which I signed．It was a contract to take a set of Scott's works for five hundred dollars．

The moment I signed I came to．But he had the contract safe in his pocket．I did not want the books．I had no place for them．They weren't of any use whatever to me．I had nobody to give them to．Yet I had agreed to buy them for five hundred dollars．

I am so accustomed to losing money that I never think first of that phase of my mistakes．It is always the play itself，the reason why．In the first place I wish to know my own limitations and habits of thought．Another reason is that I do not wish to make the same mistake a second time．A man can excuse his mistakes only by capitalising them to his subsequent profit．

Well，having made a five-hundred dollar mistake but not yet having localised the trouble，I just looked at the fellow to size him up as a first step．I'll be hanged if he didn't actually smile at me—an understanding little smile！He seemed to read my thoughts．I somehow knew that I did not have to explain anything to him；he knew it without my telling him．So I skipped the explanations and the preliminaries and asked him，“How much commission will you get on that five hundred dollar order？”

He promptly shook his head and said，“I can't do it！Sorry！”

“How much do you get？”I persisted．

“A third．But I can't do it！”he said．

“A third of five hundred dollars is one hundred and sixty-six dollars and sixty-six cents．I'll give you two hundred dollars cash if you give me back that signed contract．”And to prove it I took the money out of my pocket．

“I told you I couldn't do it，”he said．

“Do all your customers make the same offer to you？”I asked．

“No，”he answered．

“Then why were you so sure that I was going to make it？”

“It is what your type of sport would do．You are a first-class loser and that makes you a first-class businessman．I am much obliged to you，but I can't do it．”

“Now tell me why you do not wish to make more than your commission？”

“It isn't that，exactly，”he said．“I am not working just for the commission．”

“What are you working for then？”

“For the commission and the record，”he answered．

“What record？”

“Mine．”

“What are you driving at？”

“Do you work for money alone？”he asked me．

“Yes，”I said．

“No．”And he shook his head．“No，you don't．You wouldn't get enough fun out of it．You certainly do not work merely to add a few more dollars to your bank account and you are not in Wall Street because you like easy money．You get your fun some other way．Well，same here．”

I did not argue but asked him，“And how do you get your fun？”

“Well，”he confessed，“we've all got a weak spot．”

“And what's yours？”

“Vanity，”he said．

“Well，”I told him，“you succeeded in getting me to sign on．Now I want to sign off，and I am paying you two hundred dollars for ten minutes' work．Isn't that enough for your pride？”

“No，”he answered．“You see，all the rest of the bunch have been working Wall Street for months and failed to make expenses．They said it was the fault of the goods and the territory．So the office sent for me to prove that the fault was with their salesmanship and not with the books or the place．They were working on a 25 per cent commission．I was in Cleveland，where I sold eighty-two sets in two weeks．I am here to sell a certain number of sets not only to people who did not buy from the other agents but to people they couldn't even get to see．That's why they give me 33⅓ per cent．”

“I can't quite figure out how you sold me that set．”

“Why，”he said consolingly，“I sold J．P．Morgan a set．”

“No，you didn't，”I said．

He wasn't angry．He simply said，“Honest，I did！”

“A set of Walter Scott to J．P．Morgan，who not only has some fine editions but probably the original manuscripts of some of the novels as well？”

“Well，here's his John Hancock．”And he promptly flashed on me a contract signed by J．P．Morgan himself．It might not have been Mr．Morgan's signature，but it did not occur to me to doubt it at the time．Didn't he have mine in his pocket？All I felt was curiosity．So I asked him，“How did you get past the librarian？”

“I didn't see any librarian．I saw the Old Man himself．In his office．”

“That's too much！”I said．Everybody knew that it was much harder to get into Mr．Morgan's private office empty handed than into the White House with a parcel that ticked like an alarm clock．

But he declared，“I did．”

“But how did you get into his office？”

“How did I get into yours？”he retorted．

“I don't know．You tell me，”I said．

“Well，the way I got into Morgan's office and the way I got into yours are the same．I just talked to the fellow at the door whose business it was not to let me in．And the way I got Morgan to sign was the same way I got you to sign．You weren't signing a contract for a set of books．You just took the fountain pen I gave you and did what I asked you to do with it．No difference．Same as you．”

“And is that really Morgan's signature？”I asked him，about three minutes late with my skepticism．

“Sure！He learned how to write his name when he was a boy．”

“And that's all there's to it？”

“That's all，”he answered．“I know exactly what I am doing．That's all the secret there is．I am much obliged to you．Good day，Mr．Livingston．”And he started to go out．

“Hold on，”I said．“I'm bound to have you make an even two hundred dollars out of me．”And I handed him thirty-five dollars．

He shook his head．Then：“No，”he said．“I can't do that．But I can do this！”And he took the contract from his pocket，tore it in two and gave me the pieces．

I counted two hundred dollars and held the money before him，but he again shook his head．

“Isn't that what you meant？”I said．

“No．”

“Then，why did you tear up the contract？”

“Because you did not whine，but took it as I would have taken it myself had I been in your place．”

“But I offered you the two hundred dollars of my own accord，”I said．

“I know；but money isn't everything．”

Something in his voice made me say，“You're right；it isn't．And now what do you really want me to do for you？”

“You're quick，aren't you？”he said．“Do you really want to do something for me？”

“Yes，”I told him，“I do．But whether I will or not depends what it is you have in mind．”

“Take me with you into Mr．Ed Harding's office and tell him to let me talk to him three minutes by the clock．Then leave me alone with him．”

I shook my head and said，“He is a good friend of mine．”

“He's fifty years old and a stock broker，”said the book agent．

That was perfectly true，so I took him into Ed's office．I did not hear anything more from or about that book agent．But one evening some weeks later when I was going uptown I ran across him in a Sixth Avenue L train．He raised his hat very politely and I nodded back．He came over and asked me，“How do you do，Mr．Livingston？And how is Mr．Harding？”

“He's well．Why do you ask？”I felt he was holding back a story．

“I sold him two thousand dollars' worth of books that day you took me in to see him．”

“He never said a word to me about it，”I said．

“No；that kind doesn't talk about it．”

“What kind doesn't talk？”

“The kind that never makes mistakes on account of its being bad business to make them．That kind always knows what he wants and nobody can tell him different．That is the kind that's educating my children and keeps my wife in good humor．You did me a good turn，Mr．Livingston．I expected it when I gave up the two hundred dollars you were so anxious to present to me．”

“And if Mr．Harding hadn't given you an order？”

“Oh，but I knew he would．I had found out what kind of man he was．He was a cinch．”

“Yes．But if he hadn't bought any books？”I persisted．

“I'd have come back to you and sold you something．Good day，Mr．Livingston．I am going to see the mayor．”And he got up as we pulled up at Park Place．

“I hope you sell him ten sets，”I said．His Honor was a Tammany man．

“I'm a Republican，too，”he said，and went out，not hastily，but leisurely，confident that the train would wait．And it did．

I have told you this story in such detail because it concerned a remarkable man who made me buy what I did not wish to buy．He was the first man who did that to me．There never should have been a second，but there was．You can never bank on there being but one remarkable salesman in the world or on complete immunization from the influence of personality．

When Percy Thomas left my office，after I had pleasantly but definitely declined to enter into a working alliance with him，I would have sworn that our business paths would never cross．I was not sure I'd ever even see him again．But on the very next day he wrote me a letter thanking me for my offers of help and inviting me to come and see him．I answered that I would．He wrote again．I called．

I got to see a great deal of him．It was always a pleasure for me to listen to him，he knew so much and he expressed his knowledge so interestingly．I think he is the most magnetic man I ever met．

We talked of many things，for he is a widely read man with an amazing grasp of many subjects and a remarkable gift for interesting generalization．The wisdom of his speech is impressive；and as for plausibility，he hasn't an equal．I have heard many people accuse Percy Thomas of many things，including insincerity，but I sometimes wonder if his remarkable plausibility does not come from the fact that he first convinces himself so thoroughly as to acquire thereby a greatly increased power to convince others．

Of course we talked about market matters at great length．I was not bullish on cotton，but he was．I could not see the bull side at all，but he did．He brought up so many facts and figures that I ought to have been overwhelmed，but I wasn't．I couldn't disprove them because I could not deny their authenticity，but they did not shake my belief in what I read for myself．But he kept at it until I no longer felt sure of my own information as gathered from the trade papers and the dailies．That meant I couldn't see the market with my own eyes．A man cannot be convinced against his own convictions，but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision，which is even worse，for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort．

I cannot say that I got all mixed up，exactly，but I lost my poise；or rather，I ceased to do my own thinking．I cannot give you in detail the various steps by which I reached the state of mind that was to prove so costly to me．I think it was his assurances of the accuracy of his figures，which were exclusively his，and the undependability of mine，which were not exclusively mine，but public property．He harped on the utter reliability，as proved time and again，of all his ten thousand correspondents throughout the South．In the end I came to read conditions as he himself read them—because we were both reading from the same page of the same book，held by him before my eyes．He has a logical mind．Once I accepted his facts it was a cinch that my own conclusions，derived from his facts，would agree with his own．

When he began his talks with me about the cotton situation I not only was bearish but I was short of the market．Gradually，as I began to accept his facts and figures，I began to fear I had been basing my previous position on misinformation．Of course I could not feel that way and not cover．And once I had covered because Thomas made me think I was wrong，I simply had to go long．It is the way my mind works．You know，I have done nothing in my life but trade in stocks and commodities．I naturally think that if it is wrong to be bearish it must be right to be a bull．And if it is right to be a bull it is imperative to buy．As my old Palm Beach friend said Pat Hearne used to say，“You can't tell till you bet！”I must prove whether I am right on the market or not；and the proofs are to be read only in my brokers' statements at the end of the month．

I started in to buy cotton and in a jiffy I had my usual line，about sixty thousand bales．It was the most asinine play of my career．Instead of standing or falling by my own observation and deductions I was merely playing another man's game．It was eminently fitting that my silly plays should not end with that．I not only bought when I had no business to be bullish but I didn't accumulate my line in accordance with the promptings of experience．I wasn't trading right．Having listened，I was lost．

The market was not going my way．I am never afraid or impatient when I am sure of my position．But the market didn't act the way it should have acted had Thomas been right．Having taken the first wrong step I took the second and the third，and of course it muddled me all up．I allowed myself to be persuaded not only into not taking my loss but into holding up the market．That is a style of play foreign to my nature and contrary to my trading principles and theories．Even as a boy in the bucket shops I had known better．But I was not myself．I was another man—a Thomasized person．

I not only was long of cotton but I was carrying a heavy line of wheat．That was doing famously and showed me a handsome profit．My fool efforts to bolster up cotton had increased my line to about one hundred and fifty thousand bales．I may tell you that about this time I was not feeling very well．I don't say this to furnish an excuse for my blunders，but merely to state a pertinent fact．I remember I went to Bayshore for a rest．

While there I did some thinking．It seemed to me that my speculative commitments were overlarge．I am not timid as a rule，but I got to feeling nervous and that made me decide to lighten my load．To do this I must clean up either the cotton or the wheat．

It seems incredible that knowing the game as well as I did and with an experience of twelve or fourteen years of speculating in stocks and commodities I did precisely the wrong thing．The cotton showed me a loss and I kept it．The wheat showed me a profit and I sold it out．It was an utterly foolish play，but all I can say in extenuation is that it wasn't really my deal，but Thomas'．Of all speculative blunders there are few greater than trying to average a losing game．My cotton deal proved it to the hilt a little later．Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit．That was so obviously the wise thing to do and was so well known to me that even now I marvel at myself for doing the reverse．

And so I sold my wheat，deliberately cut short my profit in it．After I got out of it the price went up twenty cents a bushel without stopping．If I had kept it I might have taken a profit of about eight million dollars．And having decided to keep on with the losing proposition I bought more cotton！

I remember very clearly how every day I would buy cotton，more cotton．And why do you think I bought it？To keep the price from going down！If that isn't a supersucker play，what is？I simply kept on putting up more and more money—more money to lose eventually．My brokers and my intimate friends could not understand it；and they don't to this day．Of course if the deal had turned out differently I would have been a wonder．More than once I was warned against placing too much reliance on Percy Thomas' brilliant analyses．To this I paid no heed，but kept on buying cotton to keep it from going down．I was even buying it in Liverpool．I accumulated four hundred and forty thousand bales before I realised what I was doing．And then it was too late．So I sold out my line．

I lost nearly all that I had made out of all my other deals in stocks and commodities．I was not completely cleaned out，but I had left fewer hundreds of thousands than I had millions before I met my brilliant friend Percy Thomas．For me of all men to violate all the laws that experience had taught me to observe in order to prosper was more than asinine．

To learn that a man can make foolish plays for no reason whatever was a valuable lesson．It cost me millions to learn that another dangerous enemy to a trader is his susceptibility to the urgings of a magnetic personality when plausibly expressed by a brilliant mind．It has always seemed to me，however，that I might have learned my lesson quite as well if the cost had been only one million．But Fate does not always let you fix the tuition fee．She delivers the educational wallop and presents her own bill，knowing you have to pay it，no matter what the amount may be．Having learned what folly I was capable of I closed that particular incident．Percy Thomas went out of my life．

There I was，with more than nine-tenths of my stake，as Jim Fisk used to say，gone where the woodbine twineth—up the spout．I had been a millionaire rather less than a year．My millions I had made by using brains，helped by luck．I had lost them by reversing the process．I sold my two yachts and was decidedly less extravagant in my manner of living．

But that one blow wasn't enough．Luck was against me．I ran up first against illness and then against the urgent need of two hundred thousand dollars in cash．A few months before that sum would have been nothing at all；but now it meant almost the entire remnant of my fleet-winged fortune．I had to supply the money and the question was：Where could I get it？I didn't want to take it out of the balance I kept at my brokers' because if I did I wouldn't have much of a margin left for my own trading；and I needed trading facilities more than ever if I was to win back my millions quickly．There was only one alternative that I could see，and that was to take it out of the stock market！

Just think of it！If you know much about the average customer of the average commission house you will agree with me that the hope of making the stock market pay your bill is one of the most prolific sources of loss in Wall Street．You will chip out all you have if you adhere to your determination．

Why，in Harding's office one winter a little bunch of high flyers spent thirty or forty thousand dollars for an overcoat—and not one of them lived to wear it．It so happened that a prominent floor trader—who since has become world-famous as one of the dollar-a-year men—came down to the Exchange wearing a fur overcoat lined with sea otter．In those days，before furs went up sky high，that coat was valued at only ten thousand dollars．Well，one of the chaps in Harding's office，Bob Keown，decided to get a coat lined with Russian sable．He priced one uptown．The cost was about the same，ten thousand dollars．

“That's the devil of a lot of money，”objected one of the fellows．

“Oh，fair！Fair！”admitted Bob Keown amiably．“About a week's wages—unless you guys promise to present it to me as a slight but sincere token of the esteem in which you hold the nicest man in the office．Do I hear the presentation speech？No？Very well．I shall let the stock market buy it for me！”

“Why do you want a sable coat？”asked Ed Harding．

“It would look particularly well on a man of my inches，”replied Bob，drawing himself up．

“And how did you say you were going to pay for it？”asked Jim Murphy，who was the star tip-chaser of the office．

“By a judicious investment of a temporary character，James．That's how，”answered Bob，who knew that Murphy merely wanted a tip．

Sure enough，Jimmy asked，“What stock are you going to buy？”

“Wrong as usual，friend．This is no time to buy anything．I propose to sell five thousand Steel．It ought to go down ten points at the least．I'll just take two and a half points net．That is conservative，isn't it？”

“What do you hear about it？”asked Murphy eagerly．He was a tall thin man with black hair and a hungry look，due to his never going out to lunch for fear of missing something on the tape．

“I hear that coat's the most becoming I ever planned to get．”He turned to Harding and said，“Ed，sell five thousand U．S．Steel common at the market．Today，darling！”

He was a plunger，Bob was，and liked to indulge in humorous talk．It was his way of letting the world know that he had an iron nerve．He sold five thousand Steel，and the stock promptly went up．Not being half as big an ass as he seemed when he talked，Bob stopped his loss at one and a half points and confided to the office that the New York climate was too benign for fur coats．They were unhealthy and ostentatious．The rest of the fellows jeered．But it was not long before one of them bought some Union Pacific to pay for the coat．He lost eighteen hundred dollars and said sables were all right for the outside of a woman's wrap，but not for the inside of a garment intended to be worn by a modest and intelligent man．

After that，one after another of the fellows tried to coax the market to pay for that coat．One day I said I would buy it to keep the office from going broke．But they all said that it wasn't a sporting thing to do；that if I wanted the coat for myself I ought to let the market give it to me．But Ed Harding strongly approved of my intention and that same afternoon I went to the furrier's to buy it．I found out that a man from Chicago had bought it the week before．

That was only one case．There isn't a man in Wall Street who has not lost money trying to make the market pay for an automobile or a bracelet or a motor boat or a painting．I could build a huge hospital with the birthday presents that the tight-fisted stock market has refused to pay for．In fact，of all hoodoos in Wall Street I think the resolve to induce the stock market to act as a fairy godmother is the busiest and most persistent．

Like all well-authenticated hoodoos this has its reason for being．What does a man do when he sets out to make the stock market pay for a sudden need？Why，he merely hopes．He gambles．He therefore runs much greater risks than he would if he were speculating intelligently，in accordance with opinions or beliefs logically arrived at after a dispassionate study of underlying conditions．To begin with，he is after an immediate profit．He cannot afford to wait．The market must be nice to him at once if at all．He flatters himself that he is not asking more than to place an even-money bet．Because he is prepared to run quick—say，stop his loss at two points when all he hopes to make is two points—he hugs the fallacy that he is merely taking a fifty-fifty chance．Why，I've known men to lose thousands of dollars on such trades，particularly on purchases made at the height of a bull market just before a moderate reaction．It certainly is no way to trade．

Well，that crowning folly of my career as a stock operator was the last straw．It beat me．I lost what little my cotton deal had left me．It did even more harm，for I kept on trading—and losing．I persisted in thinking that the stock market must perforce make money for me in the end．But the only end in sight was the end of my resources．I went into debt，not only to my principal brokers but to other houses that accepted business from me without my putting up an adequate margin．I not only got in debt but I stayed in debt from then on．





Chapter XIII


THERE I was，once more broke，which was bad，and dead wrong in my trading，which was a sight worse．I was sick，nervous，upset and unable to reason calmly．That is，I was in the frame of mind in which no speculator should be when he is trading．Everything went wrong with me．Indeed，I began to think that I could not recover my departed sense of proportion．Having grown accustomed to swinging a big line—say，more than a hundred thousand shares of stock—I feared I would not show good judgment trading in a small way．It scarcely seemed worth while being right when all you carried was a hundred shares of stock．After the habit of taking a big profit on a big line I wasn't sure I would know when to take my profit on a small line．I can't describe to you how weaponless I felt．

Broke again and incapable of assuming the offensive vigorously．In debt and wrong！After all those long years of successes，tempered by mistakes that really served to pave the way for greater successes，I was now worse off than when I began in the bucket shops．I had learned a great deal about the game of stock speculation，but I had not learned quite so much about the play of human weaknesses．There is no mind so machinelike that you can depend upon it to function with equal efficiency at all times．I now learned that I could not trust myself to remain equally unaffected by men and misfortunes at all times．

Money losses have never worried me in the slightest．But other troubles could and did．I studied my disaster in detail and of course found no difficulty in seeing just where I had been silly．I spotted the exact time and place．A man must know himself thoroughly if he is going to make a good job out of trading in the speculative markets．To know what I was capable of in the line of folly was a long educational step．I sometimes think that no price is too high for a speculator to pay to learn that which will keep him from getting the swelled head．A great many smashes by brilliant men can be traced directly to the swelled head—an expensive disease everywhere to everybody，but particularly in Wall Street to a speculator．

I was not happy in New York，feeling the way I did．I didn't want to trade，because I wasn't in good trading trim．I decided to go away and seek a stake elsewhere．The change of scene could help me to find myself again，I thought．So once more I left New York，beaten by the game of speculation．I was worse than broke，since I owed over one hundred thousand dollars spread among various brokers．

I went to Chicago and there found a stake．It was not a very substantial stake，but that merely meant that I would need a little more time to win back my fortune．A house that I once had done business with had faith in my ability as a trader and they were willing to prove it by allowing me to trade in their office in a small way．

I began very conservatively．I don't know how I might have fared had I stayed there．But one of the most remarkable experiences in my career cut short my stay in Chicago．It is an almost incredible story．

One day I got a telegram from Lucius Tucker．I had known him when he was the office manager of a Stock Exchange firm that I had at times given some business to，but I had lost track of him．The telegram read：

Come to New York at once．

L．TUCKER．

I knew that he knew from mutual friends how I was fixed and therefore it was certain he had something up his sleeve．At the same time I had no money to throw away on an unnecessary trip to New York；so instead of doing what he asked me to do I got him on the long distance．

“I got your telegram，”I said．“What does it mean？”

“It means that a big banker in New York wants to see you，”he answered．

“Who is it？”I asked．I couldn't imagine who it could be．

“I'll tell you when you get to New York．No use otherwise．”

“You say he wants to see me？”

“He does．”

“What about？”

“He'll tell you that in person if you give him a chance，”said Lucius．

“Can't you write me？”

“No．”

“Then tell me more plainly，”I said．

“I don't want to．”

“Look here，Lucius，”I said，“just tell me this much：Is this a fool trip？”

“Certainly not．It will be to your advantage to come．”

“Can't you give me an inkling？”

“No，”he said．“It wouldn't be fair to him．And besides，I don't know just how much he wants to do for you．But take my advice：Come，and come quick．”

“Are you sure it is I that he wishes to see？”

“Nobody else but you will do．Better come，I tell you．Telegraph me what train you take and I'll meet you at the station．”

“Very well，”I said，and hung up．

I didn't like quite so much mystery，but I knew that Lucius was friendly and that he must have a good reason for talking the way he did．I wasn't faring so sumptuously in Chicago that it would break my heart to leave it．At the rate I was trading it would be a long time before I could get together enough money to operate on the old scale．

I came back to New York，not knowing what would happen．Indeed，more than once during the trip I feared nothing at all would happen and that I'd be out my railroad fare and my time．I could not guess that I was about to have the most curious experience of my entire life．

Lucius met me at the station and did not waste any time in telling me that he had sent for me at the urgent request of Mr．Daniel Williamson，of the well-known Stock Exchange house of Williamson & Brown．Mr．Williamson told Lucius to tell me that he had a business proposition to make to me that he was sure I would accept since it would be very profitable for me．Lucius swore he didn't know what the proposition was．The character of the firm was a guaranty that nothing improper would be demanded of me．

Dan Williamson was the senior member of the firm，which was founded by Egbert Williamson way back in the '70's．There was no Brown and hadn't been one in the firm for years．The house had been very prominent in Dan's father's time and Dan had inherited a considerable fortune and didn't go after much outside business．They had one customer who was worth a hundred average customers and that was Alvin Marquand，Williamson's brother-in-law，who in addition to being a director in a dozen banks and trust companies was the president of the great Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad system．He was the most picturesque personality in the railroad world after James J．Hill，and was the spokesman and dominant member of the powerful banking coterie known as the Fort Dawson gang．He was worth from fifty million to five hundred million dollars，the estimate depending upon the state of the speaker's liver．When he died they found out that he was worth two hundred and fifty million dollars，all made in Wall Street．So you see he was some customer．

Lucius told me he had just accepted a position with Williamson & Brown—one that was made for him．He was supposed to be a sort of circulating general business getter．The firm was after a general commission business and Lucius had induced Mr．Williamson to open a couple of branch offices，one in one of the big hotels uptown and the other in Chicago．I rather gathered that I was going to be offered a position in the latter place，possibly as office manager，which was something I would not accept．I didn't jump on Lucius because I thought I'd better wait until the offer was made before I refused it．

Lucius took me into Mr．Williamson's private office，introduced me to his chief and left the room in a hurry，as though he wished to avoid being called as witness in a case in which he knew both parties．I prepared to listen and then to say no．

Mr．Williamson was very pleasant．He was a thorough gentleman，with polished manners and a kindly smile．I could see that he made friends easily and kept them．Why not？He was healthy and therefore good-humored．He had slathers of money and therefore could not be suspected of sordid motives．These things，together with his education and social training，made it easy for him to be not only polite but friendly，and not only friendly but helpful．

I said nothing．I had nothing to say and，besides，I always let the other man have his say in full before I do any talking．Somebody told me that the late James Stillman，president of the National City Bank—who，by the way，was an intimate friend of Williamson's—made it his practice to listen in silence，with an impassive face，to anybody who brought a proposition to him．After the man got through Mr．Stillman continued to look at him，as though the man had not finished．So the man，feeling urged to say something more，did so．Simply by looking and listening Stillman often made the man offer terms much more advantageous to the bank than he had meant to offer when he began to speak．

I don't keep silent just to induce people to offer a better bargain，but because I like to know all the facts of the case．By letting a man have his say in full you are able to decide at once．It is a great time-saver．It averts debates and prolonged discussions that get nowhere．Nearly every business proposition that is brought to me can be settled，as far as my participation in it is concerned，by my saying yes or no．But I cannot say yes or no right off unless I have the complete proposition before me．

Dan Williamson did the talking and I did the listening．He told me he had heard a great deal about my operations in the stock market and how he regretted that I had gone outside of my bailiwick and come a cropper in cotton．Still it was to my bad luck that he owed the pleasure of that interview with me．He thought my forte was the stock market，that I was born for it and that I should not stray from it．

“And that is the reason，Mr．Livingston，”he concluded pleasantly，“why we wish to do business with you．”

“Do business how？”I asked him．

“Be your brokers，”he said．“My firm would like to do your stock business．”

“I'd like to give it to you，”I said，“but I can't．”

“Why not？”he asked．

“I haven't any money，”I answered．

“That part is all right，”he said with a friendly smile．“I'll furnish it．”He took out a pocket check book，wrote out a check for twenty-five thousand dollars to my order，and gave it to me．

“What's this for？”I asked．

“For you to deposit in your own bank．You will draw your own checks．I want you to do your trading in our office．I don't care whether you win or lose．If that money goes I will give you another personal check．So you don't have to be so very careful with this one．See？”

I knew that the firm was too rich and prosperous to need anybody's business，much less to give a fellow the money to put up as margin．And then he was so nice about it！Instead of giving me a credit with the house he gave me the actual cash，so that he alone knew where it came from，the only string being that if I traded I should do so through his firm．And then the promise that there would be more if that went！Still，there must be a reason．

“What's the idea？”I asked him．

“The idea is simply that we want to have a customer in this office who is known as a big active trader．Everybody knows that you swing a big line on the short side，which is what I particularly like about you．You are known as a plunger．”

“I still don't get it，”I said．

“I'll be frank with you，Mr．Livingston．We have two or three very wealthy customers who buy and sell stocks in a big way．I don't want the Street to suspect them of selling long stock every time we sell ten or twenty thousand shares of any stock．If the Street knows that you are trading in our office it will not know whether it is your short selling or the other customers' long stock that is coming on the market．”

I understood at once．He wanted to cover up his brother-in-law's operations with my reputation as a plunger！It so happened that I had made my biggest killing on the bear side a year and a half before，and，of course，the Street gossips and the stupid rumor mongers had acquired the habit of blaming me for every decline in prices．To this day when the market is very weak they say I am raiding it．

I didn't have to reflect．I saw at a glance that Dan Williamson was offering me a chance to come back and come back quickly．I took the check，banked it，opened an account with his firm and began trading．It was a good active market，broad enough for a man not to have to stick to one or two specialties．I had begun to fear，as I told you，that I had lost the knack of hitting it right．But it seems I hadn't．In three weeks' time I had made a profit of one hundred and twelve thousand dollars out of the twenty-five thousand that Dan Williamson lent me．

I went to him and said，“I've come to pay you back that twenty-five thousand dollars．”

“No，no！”he said and waved me away exactly as if I had offered him a castor-oil cocktail．“No，no，my boy．Wait until your account amounts to something．Don't think about it yet．You've only got chicken feed there．”

There is where I made the mistake that I have regretted more than any other I ever made in my Wall Street career．It was responsible for long and dreary years of suffering．I should have insisted on his taking the money．I was on my way to a bigger fortune than I had lost and walking pretty fast．For three weeks my average profit was 150 per cent per week．From then on my trading would be on a steadily increasing scale．But instead of freeing myself from all obligation I let him have his way and did not compel him to accept the twenty-five thousand dollars．Of course，since he didn't draw out the twenty-five thousand dollars he had advanced me I felt I could not very well draw out my profit．I was very grateful to him，but I am so constituted that I don't like to owe money or favours．I can pay the money back with money，but the favours and kindnesses I must pay back in kind—and you are apt to find these moral obligations mighty high priced at times．Moreover there is no statute of limitations．

I left the money undisturbed and resumed my trading．I was getting on very nicely．I was recovering my poise and I was sure it would not be very long before I should get back into my 1907 stride．Once I did that，all I'd ask for would be for the market to hold out a little while and I'd more than make up my losses．But making or not making the money was not bothering me much．What made me happy was that I was losing the habit of being wrong，of not being myself．It had played havoc with me for months but I had learned my lesson．

Just about that time I turned bear and I began to sell short several railroad stocks．Among them was Chesapeake & Atlantic．I think I put out a short line in it；about eight thousand shares．

One morning when I got downtown Dan Williamson called me into his private office before the market opened and said to me：“Larry，don't do anything in Chesapeake & Atlantic just now．That was a bad play of yours，selling eight thousand short．I covered it for you this morning in London and went long．”

I was sure Chesapeake & Atlantic was going down．The tape told it to me quite plainly；and besides I was bearish on the whole market，not violently or insanely bearish，but enough to feel comfortable with a moderate short line out．I said to Williamson，“What did you do that for？I am bearish on the whole market and they are all going lower．”

But he just shook his head and said，“I did it because I happen to know something about Chesapeake & Atlantic that you couldn't know．My advice to you is not to sell that stock short until I tell you it is safe to do so．”

What could I do？That wasn't an asinine tip．It was advice that came from the brother-in-law of the chairman of the board of directors．Dan was not only Alvin Marquand's closest friend but he had been kind and generous to me．He had shown his faith in me and confidence in my word．I couldn't do less than to thank him．And so my feelings again won over my judgment and I gave in．To subordinate my judgment to his desires was the undoing of me．Gratitude is something a decent man can't help feeling，but it is for a fellow to keep it from completely tying him up．The first thing I knew I not only had lost all my profit but I owed the firm one hundred and fifty thousand dollars besides．I felt pretty badly about it，but Dan told me not to worry．

“I'll get you out of this hole，”he promised．“I know I will．But I can only do it if you let me．You will have to stop doing business on your own hook．I can't be working for you and then have you completely undo all my work in your behalf．Just you lay off the market and give me a chance to make some money for you．Won't you，Larry？”

Again I ask you：What could I do？I thought of his kindliness and I could not do anything that might be construed as lacking in appreciation．I had grown to like him．He was very pleasant and friendly．I remember that all I got from him was encouragement．He kept on assuring me that everything would come out O．K．One day，perhaps six months later，he came to me with a pleased smile and gave me some credit slips．

“I told you I would pull you out of that hole，”he said，“and I have．”And then I discovered that not only had he wiped out the debt entirely but I had a small credit balance besides．

I think I could have run that up without much trouble，for the market was right，but he said to me，“I have bought you ten thousand shares of Southern Atlantic．”That was another road controlled by his brother-in-law，Alvin Marquand，who also ruled the market destinies of the stock．

When a man does for you what Dan Williamson did for me you can't say anything but“Thank you”—no matter what your market views may be．You may be sure you're right，but as Pat Hearne used to say：“You can't tell till you bet！”and Dan Williamson had bet for me—with his money．

Well，Southern Atlantic went down and stayed down and I lost，I forget how much，on my ten thousand shares before Dan sold me out．I owed him more than ever．But you never saw a nicer or less importunate creditor in your life．Never a whimper from him．Instead，encouraging words and admonitions not to worry about it．In the end the loss was made up for me in the same generous but mysterious way．

He gave no details whatever．They were all numbered accounts．Dan Williamson would just say to me，“We made up your Southern Atlantic loss with profits on this other deal，”and he'd tell me how he had sold seventy-five hundred shares of some other stock and made a nice thing out of it．I can truthfully say that I never knew a blessed thing about those trades of mine until I was told that the indebtedness was wiped out．

After that happened several times I began to think，and I got to look at my case from a different angle．Finally I tumbled．It was plain that I had been used by Dan Williamson．It made me angry to think it，but still angrier that I had not tumbled to it quicker．As soon as I had gone over the whole thing in my mind I went to Dan Williamson，told him I was through with the firm，and I quit the office of Williamson & Brown．I had no words with him or any of his partners．What good would that have done me？But I will admit that I was sore—at myself quite as much as at Williamson & Brown．

The loss of the money didn't bother me．Whenever I have lost money in the stock market I have always considered that I have learned something；that if I have lost money I have gained experience，so that the money really went for a tuition fee．A man has to have experience and he has to pay for it．But there was something that hurt a whole lot in that experience of mine in Dan Williamson's office，and that was the loss of a great opportunity．The money a man loses is nothing；he can make it up．But opportunities such as I had then do not come every day．

The market，you see，had been a fine trading market．I was right；I mean，I was reading it accurately．The opportunity to make millions was there．But I allowed my gratitude to interfere with my play．I tied my own hands．I had to do what Dan Williamson in his kindness wished done．Altogether it was more unsatisfactory than doing business with a relative．Bad business！

And that wasn't the worst thing about it．It was that after that there was practically no opportunity for me to make big money．The market flattened out．Things drifted from bad to worse．I not only lost all I had but got into debt again—more heavily than ever．Those were long lean years，1911，1912，1913 and 1914．There was no money to be made．The opportunity simply wasn't there and so I was worse off than ever．

It isn't uncomfortable to lose when the loss is not accompanied by a poignant vision of what might have been．That was precisely what I could not keep my mind from dwelling on，and of course it unsettled me further．I learned that the weaknesses to which a speculator is prone are almost numberless．It was proper for me as a man to act the way I did in Dan Williamson's office，but it was improper and unwise for me as a speculator to allow myself to be influenced by any consideration to act against my own judgment．Noblesse oblige—but not in the stock market，because the tape is not chivalrous and moreover does not reward loyalty．I realise that I couldn't have acted differently．I couldn't make myself over just because I wished to trade in the stock market．But business is business always，and my business as a speculator is to back my own judgment always．

It was a very curious experience．I'll tell you what I think happened．Dan Williamson was perfectly sincere in what he told me when he first saw me．Every time his firm did a few thousand shares in any one stock the Street jumped at the conclusion that Alvin Marquand was buying or selling．He was the big trader of the office，to be sure，and he gave this firm all his business；and he was one of the best and biggest traders they have ever had in Wall Street．Well，I was to be used as a smoke screen，particularly for Marquand's selling．

Alvin Marquand fell sick shortly after I went in．His ailment was early diagnosed as incurable，and Dan Williamson of course knew it long before Marquand himself did．That is why Dan covered my Chesapeake & Atlantic stock．He had begun to liquidate some of his brother-in-law's speculative holdings of that and other stocks．

Of course when Marquand died the estate had to liquidate his speculative and semispeculative lines，and by that time we had run into a bear market．By tying me up the way he did，Dan was helping the estate a whole lot．I do not speak boastfully when I say that I was a very heavy trader and that I was dead right in my views on the stock market．I know that Williamson remembered my successful operations in the bear market of 1907 and he couldn't afford to run the risk of having me at large．Why，if I had kept on the way I was going I'd have made so much money that by the time he was trying to liquidate part of Alvin Marquand's estate I would have been trading in hundreds of thousands of shares．As an active bear I would have done damage running into the millions of dollars to the Marquand heirs，for Alvin left only a little over a couple of hundred millions．

It was much cheaper for them to let me get into debt and then to pay off the debt than to have me in some other office operating actively on the bear side．That is precisely what I would have been doing but for my feeling that I must not be outdone in decency by Dan Williamson．

I have always considered this the most interesting and most unfortunate of all my experiences as a stock operator．As a lesson it cost me a disproportionately high price．It put off the time of my recovery several years．I was young enough to wait with patience for the strayed millions to come back．But five years is a long time for a man to be poor．Young or old，it is not to be relished．I could do without the yachts a great deal easier than I could without a market to come back on．The greatest opportunity of a lifetime was holding before my very nose the purse I had lost．I could not put out my hand and reach for it．A very shrewd boy，that Dan Williamson；as slick as they make them；farsighted，ingenious，daring．He is a thinker，has imagination，detects the vulnerable spot in any man and can plan cold-bloodedly to hit it．He did his own sizing up and soon doped out just what to do to me in order to reduce me to complete inoffensiveness in the market．He did not actually do me out of any money．On the contrary，he was to all appearances extremely nice about it．He loved his sister，Mrs．Marquand，and he did his duty toward her as he saw it．





Chapter XIV


IT has always rankled in my mind that after I left Williamson & Brown's office the cream was off the market．We ran smack into a long moneyless period；four mighty lean years．There was not a penny to be made．As Billy Henriquez once said，“It was the kind of market in which not even a skunk could make a scent．”

It looked to me as though I was in Dutch with destiny．It might have been the plan of Providence to chasten me，but really I had not been filled with such pride as called for a fall．I had not committed any of those speculative sins which a trader must expiate on the debtor side of the account．I was not guilty of a typical sucker play．What I had done，or，rather，what I had left undone，was something for which I would have received praise and not blame—north of Forty-second Street．In Wall Street it was absurd and costly．But by far the worst thing about it was the tendency it had to make a man a little less inclined to permit himself human feelings in the ticker district．

I left Williamson's and tried other brokers' offices．In every one of them I lost money．It served me right，because I was trying to force the market into giving me what it didn't have to give—to wit，opportunities for making money．I did not find any trouble in getting credit，because those who knew me had faith in me．You can get an idea of how strong their confidence was when I tell you that when I finally stopped trading on credit I owed well over one million dollars．

The trouble was not that I had lost my grip but that during those four wretched years the opportunities for making money simply didn't exist．Still I plugged along，trying to make a stake and succeeding only in increasing my indebtedness．After I ceased trading on my own hook because I wouldn't owe my friends any more money I made a living handling accounts for people who believed I knew the game well enough to beat it even in a dull market．For my services I received a percentage of the profits—when there were any．That is how I lived．Well，say that is how I sustained life．

Of course，I didn't always lose，but I never made enough to allow me materially to reduce what I owed．Finally，as things got worse，I felt the beginnings of discouragement for the first time in my life．

Everything seemed to have gone wrong with me．I did not go about bewailing the descent from millions and yachts to debts and the simple life．I didn't enjoy the situation，but I did not fill up with self-pity．I did not propose to wait patiently for time and Providence to bring about the cessation of my discomforts．I therefore studied my problem．It was plain that the only way out of my troubles was by making money．To make money I needed merely to trade successfully．I had so traded before and I must do so once more．More than once in the past I had run up a shoe string into hundreds of thousands．Sooner or later the market would offer me an opportunity．

I convinced myself that whatever was wrong was wrong with me and not with the market．Now what could be the trouble with me？I asked myself that question in the same spirit in which I always study the various phases of my trading problems．I thought about it calmly and came to the conclusion that my main trouble came from worrying over the money I owed．I was never free from the mental discomfort of it．I must explain to you that it was not the mere consciousness of my indebtedness．Any business man contracts debts in the course of his regular business．Most of my debts were really nothing but business debts，due to what were unfavourable business conditions for me，and no worse than a merchant suffers from，for instance，when there is an unusually prolonged spell of unseasonable weather．

Of course as time went on and I could not pay I began to feel less philosophical about my debts．I'll explain：I owed over a million dollars—all of it stock-market losses，remember．Most of my creditors were very nice and didn't bother me；but there were two who did bedevil me．They used to follow me around．Every time I made a winning each of them was Johnny-on-the-spot，wanting to know all about it and insisting on getting theirs right off．One of them，to whom I owed eight hundred dollars，threatened to sue me，seize my furniture，and so forth．I can't conceive why he thought I was concealing assets，unless it was that I didn't quite look like a stage hobo about to die of destitution．

As I studied the problem I saw that it wasn't a case that called for reading the tape but for reading my own self．I quite cold-bloodedly reached the conclusion that I would never be able to accomplish anything useful so long as I was worried，and it was equally plain that I should be worried so long as I owed money．I mean，as long as any creditor had the power to vex me or to interfere with my coming back by insisting upon being paid before I could get a decent stake together．This was all so obviously true that I said to myself，“I must go through bankruptcy．”What else could relieve my mind？

It sounds both easy and sensible，doesn't it？But it was more than unpleasant，I can tell you．I hated to do it．I hated to put myself in a position to be misunderstood or misjudged．I myself never cared much for money．I never thought enough of it to consider it worth while lying for．But I knew that everybody didn't feel that way．Of course I also knew that if I got on my feet again I'd pay everybody off，for the obligation remained．But unless I was able to trade in the old way I'd never be able to pay back that million．

I nerved myself and went to see my creditors．It was a mighty difficult thing for me to do，for all that most of them were personal friends or old acquaintances．

I explained the situation quite frankly to them．I said：“I am not going to take this step because I don't wish to pay you but because，in justice to both myself and you，I must put myself in a position to make money．I have been thinking of this solution off and on for over two years，but I simply didn't have the nerve to come out and say so frankly to you．It would have been infinitely better for all of us if I had．It all simmers down to this：I positively cannot be my old self while I am harassed or upset by these debts．I have decided to do now what I should have done a year ago．I have no other reason than the one I have just given you．”

What the first man said was to all intents and purposes what all of them said．He spoke for his firm．

“Livingston，”he said，“we understand．We realise your position perfectly．I'll tell you what we'll do：we'll just give you a release．Have your lawyer prepare any kind of paper you wish，and we'll sign it．”

That was in substance what all my big creditors said．That is one side of Wall Street for you．It wasn't merely careless good nature or sportsmanship．It was also a mighty intelligent decision，for it was clearly good business．I appreciated both the good will and the business gumption．

These creditors gave me a release on debts amounting to over a million dollars．But there were the two minor creditors who wouldn't sign off．One of them was the eight-hundred-dollar man I told you about．I also owed sixty thousand dollars to a brokerage firm which had gone into bankruptcy，and the receivers，who didn't know me from Adam，were on my neck early and late．Even if they had been disposed to follow the example set by my largest creditors I don't suppose the court would have let them sign off．At all events my schedule of bankruptcy amounted to only about one hundred thousand dollars；though，as I said，I owed well over a million．

It was extremely disagreeable to see the story in the newspapers．I had always paid my debts in full and this new experience was most mortifying to me．I knew I'd pay off everybody some day if I lived，but everybody who read the article wouldn't know it．I was ashamed to go out after I saw the report in the newspapers．But it all wore off presently and I cannot tell you how intense was my feeling of relief to know that I wasn't going to be harried any more by people who didn't understand how a man must give his entire mind to his business—if he wishes to succeed in stock speculation．

My mind now being free to take up trading with some prospect of success，unvexed by debts，the next step was to get another stake．The Stock Exchange had been closed from July thirty-first to the middle of December，1914，and Wall Street was in the dumps．There hadn't been any business whatever in a long time．I owed all my friends．I couldn't very well ask them to help me again just because they had been so pleasant and friendly to me，when I knew that nobody was in a position to do much for anybody．

It was a mighty difficult task，getting a decent stake，for with the closing of the Stock Exchange there was nothing that I could ask any broker to do for me．I tried in a couple of places．No use．

Finally I went to see Dan Williamson．This was in February，1915．I told him that I had rid myself of the mental incubus of debt and I was ready to trade as of old．You will recall that when he needed me he offered me the use of twenty-five thousand dollars without my asking him．

Now that I needed him he said，“When you see something that looks good to you and you want to buy five hundred shares go ahead and it will be all right．”

I thanked him and went away．He had kept me from making a great deal of money and the office had made a lot in commissions from me．I admit I was a little sore to think that Williamson & Brown didn't give me a decent stake．I intended to trade conservatively at first．It would make my financial recovery easier and quicker if I could begin with a line a little better than five hundred shares．But，anyhow，I realised that，such as it was，there was my chance to come back．

I left Dan Williamson's office and studied the situation in general and my own problem in particular．It was a bull market．That was as plain to me as it was to thousands of traders．But my stake consisted merely of an offer to carry five hundred shares for me．That is，I had no leeway，limited as I was．I couldn't afford even a slight setback at the beginning．I must build up my stake with my very first play．That initial purchase of mine of five hundred shares must be profitable．I had to make real money．I knew that unless I had sufficient trading capital I would not be able to use good judgment．Without adequate margins it would be impossible to take the cold-blooded，dispassionate attitude toward the game that comes from the ability to afford a few minor losses such as I often incurred in testing the market before putting down the big bet．

I think now that I found myself then at the most critical period of my career as a speculator．If I failed this time there was no telling where or when，if ever，I might get another stake for another try．It was very clear that I simply must wait for the exact psychological moment．

I didn't go near Williamson & Brown's．I mean，I purposely kept away from them for six long weeks of steady tape reading．I was afraid that if I went to the office，knowing that I could buy five hundred shares，I might be tempted into trading at the wrong time or in the wrong stock．A trader，in addition to studying basic conditions，remembering market precedents and keeping in mind the psychology of the outside public as well as the limitations of his brokers，must also know himself and provide against his own weaknesses．There is no need to feel anger over being human．I have come to feel that it is as necessary to know how to read myself as to know how to read the tape．I have studied and reckoned on my own reactions to given impulses or to the inevitable temptations of an active market，quite in the same mood and spirit as I have considered crop conditions or analysed reports of earnings．

So day after day，broke and anxious to resume trading，I sat in front of a quotation-board in another broker's office where I couldn't buy or sell as much as one share of stock，studying the market，not missing a single transaction on the tape，watching for the psychological moment to ring the full-speed-ahead bell．

By reason of conditions known to the whole world the stock I was most bullish on in those critical days of early 1915 was Bethlehem Steel．I was morally certain it was going way up，but in order to make sure that I would win on my very first play，as I must，I decided to wait until it crossed par．

I think I have told you it has been my experience that whenever a stock crosses 100 or 200 or 300 for the first time，it nearly always keeps going up for 30 to 50 points—and after 300 faster than after 100 or 200．One of my first big coups was in Anaconda，which I bought when it crossed 200 and sold a day later at 260．My practice of buying a stock just after it crossed par dated back to my early bucket-shop days．It is an old trading principle．

You can imagine how keen I was to get back to trading on my old scale．I was so eager to begin that I could not think of anything else；but I held myself in leash．I saw Bethlehem Steel climb，every day，higher and higher，as I was sure it would，and yet there I was checking my impulse to run over to Williamson & Brown's office and buy five hundred shares．I knew I simply had to make my initial operation as nearly a cinch as was humanly possible．

Every point that stock went up meant five hundred dollars I had not made．The first ten points' advance meant that I would have been able to pyramid，and instead of five hundred shares I might now be carrying one thousand shares that would be earning for me one thousand dollars a point．But I sat tight and instead of listening to my loud-mouthed hopes or to my clamorous beliefs I heeded only the level voice of my experience and the counsel of common sense．Once I got a decent stake together I could afford to take chances．But without a stake，taking chances，even slight chances，was a luxury utterly beyond my reach．Six weeks of patience—but，in the end，a victory for common sense over greed and hope！

I really began to waver and sweat blood when the stock got up to 90．Think of what I had not made by not buying，when I was so bullish．Well，when it got to 98 I said to myself，“Bethlehem is going through 100，and when it does the roof is going to blow clean off！”The tape said the same thing more than plainly．In fact，it used a megaphone．I tell you，I saw 100 on the tape when the ticker was only printing 98．And I knew that wasn't the voice of my hope or the sight of my desire，but the assertion of my tape-reading instinct．So I said to myself，“I can't wait until it gets through 100．I have to get it now．It is as good as gone through par．”

I rushed to Williamson & Brown's office and put in an order to buy five hundred shares of Bethlehem Steel．The market was then 98．I got five hundred shares at 98 to 99．After that she shot right up，and closed that night，I think，at 114 or 115．I bought five hundred shares more．

The next day Bethlehem Steel was 145 and I had my stake．But I earned it．Those six weeks of waiting for the right moment were the most strenuous and wearing six weeks I ever put in．But it paid me，for I now had enough capital to trade in fair-sized lots．I never would have got anywhere just on five hundred shares of stock．

There is a great deal in starting right，whatever the enterprise may be，and I did very well after my Bethlehem deal—so well，indeed，that you would not have believed it was the selfsame man trading．As a matter of fact I wasn't the same man，for where I had been harassed and wrong I was now at ease and right．There were no creditors to annoy and no lack of funds to interfere with my thinking or with my listening to the truthful voice of experience，and so I was winning right along．

All of a sudden，as I was on my way to a sure fortune，we had the Lusitania break．Every once in a while a man gets a crack like that in the solar plexus，probably that he may be reminded of the sad fact that no human being can be so uniformly right on the market as to be beyond the reach of unprofitable accidents．I have heard people say that no professional speculator need have been hit very hard by the news of the torpedoing of the Lusitania，and they go on to tell how they had it long before the Street did．I was not clever enough to escape by means of advance information，and all I can tell you is that on account of what I lost through the Lusitania break and one or two other reverses that I wasn't wise enough to foresee，I found myself at the end of 1915 with a balance at my brokers' of about one hundred and forty thousand dollars．That was all I actually made，though I was consistently right on the market throughout the greater part of the year．

I did much better during the following year．I was very lucky．I was rampantly bullish in a wild bull market．Things were certainly coming my way so that there wasn't anything to do but to make money．It made me remember a saying of the late H．H．Rogers，of the Standard Oil Company，to the effect that there were times when a man could no more help making money than he could help getting wet if he went out in a rainstorm without an umbrella．It was the most clearly defined bull market we ever had．It was plain to everybody that the Allied purchases of all kinds of supplies here made the United States the most prosperous nation in the world．We had all the things that no one else had for sale，and we were fast getting all the cash in the world．I mean that the wide world's gold was pouring into this country in torrents．Inflation was inevitable，and，of course，that meant rising prices for everything．

All this was so evident from the first that little or no manipulation for the rise was needed．That was the reason why the preliminary work was so much less than in other bull markets．And not only was the war-bride boom more naturally developed than all others but it proved unprecedentedly profitable for the general public．That is，the stock-market winnings during 1915 were more widely distributed than in any other boom in the history of Wall Street．That the public did not turn all their paper profits into good hard cash or that they did not long keep what profits they actually took was merely history repeating itself．Nowhere does history indulge in repetitions so often or so uniformly as in Wall Street．When you read contemporary accounts of booms or panics the one thing that strikes you most forcibly is how little either stock speculation or stock speculators today differ from yesterday．The game does not change and neither does human nature．

I went along with the rise in 1916．I was as bullish as the next man，but of course I kept my eyes open．I knew，as everybody did，that there must be an end，and I was on the watch for warning signals．I wasn't particularly interested in guessing from which quarter the tip would come and so I didn't stare at just one spot．I was not，and I never have felt that I was，wedded indissolubly to one or the other side of the market．That a bull market has added to my bank account or a bear market has been particularly generous I do not consider sufficient reason for sticking to the bull or the bear side after I receive the get-out warning．A man does not swear eternal allegiance to either the bull or the bear side．His concern lies with being right．

And there is another thing to remember，and that is that a market does not culminate in one grand blaze of glory．Neither does it end with a sudden reversal of form．A market can and does often cease to be a bull market long before prices generally begin to break．My long expected warning came to me when I noticed that，one after another，those stocks which had been the leaders of the market reacted several points from the top and—for the first time in many months—did not come back．Their race evidently was run，and that clearly necessitated a change in my trading tactics．

It was simple enough．In a bull market the trend of prices，of course，is decidedly and definitely upward．Therefore whenever a stock goes against the general trend you are justified in assuming that there is something wrong with that particular stock．It is enough for the experienced trader to perceive that something is wrong．He must not expect the tape to become a lecturer．His job is to listen for it to say“Get out！”and not wait for it to submit a legal brief for approval．

As I said before，I noticed that stocks which had been the leaders of the wonderful advance had ceased to advance．They dropped six or seven points and stayed there．At the same time the rest of the market kept on advancing under new standard bearers．Since nothing wrong had developed with the companies themselves，the reason had to be sought elsewhere．Those stocks had gone with the current for months．When they ceased to do so，though the bull tide was still running strong，it meant that for those particular stocks the bull market was over．For the rest of the list the tendency was still decidedly upward．

There was no need to be perplexed into inactivity，for there were really no cross currents．I did not turn bearish on the market then，because the tape didn't tell me to do so．The end of the bull market had not come，though it was within hailing distance．Pending its arrival there was still bull money to be made．Such being the case，I merely turned bearish on the stocks which had stopped advancing and as the rest of the market had rising power behind it I both bought and sold．

The leaders that had ceased to lead I sold．I put out a short line of five thousand shares in each of them；and then I went long of the new leaders．The stocks I was short of didn't do much，but my long stocks kept on rising．When finally these in turn ceased to advance I sold them out and went short—five thousand shares of each．By this time I was more bearish than bullish，because obviously the next big money was going to be made on the down side．While I felt certain that the bear market had really begun before the bull market had really ended，I knew the time for being a rampant bear was not yet．There was no sense in being more royalist than the king；especially in being so too soon．The tape merely said that patrolling parties from the main bear army had dashed by．Time to get ready．

I kept on both buying and selling until after about a month's trading I had out a short line of sixty thousand shares— five thousand shares each in a dozen different stocks which earlier in the year had been the public's favourites because they had been the leaders of the great bull market．It was not a very heavy line；but don't forget that neither was the market definitely bearish．

Then one day the entire market became quite weak and prices of all stocks began to fall．When I had a profit of at least four points in each and every one of the twelve stocks that I was short of，I knew that I was right．The tape told me it was now safe to be bearish，so I promptly doubled up．

I had my position．I was short of stocks in a market that now was plainly a bear market．There wasn't any need for me to push things along．The market was bound to go my way，and，knowing that，I could afford to wait．After I doubled up I didn't make another trade for a long time．About seven weeks after I put out my full line，we had the famous“leak，”and stocks broke badly．It was said that somebody had advance news from Washington that President Wilson was going to issue a message that would bring back the dove of peace to Europe in a hurry．Of course the war-bride boom was started and kept up by the World War，and peace was a bear item．When one of the cleverest traders on the floor was accused of profiting by advance information he simply said he had sold stocks not on any news but because he considered that the bull market was overripe．I myself had doubled my line of shorts seven weeks before．

On the news the market broke badly and I naturally covered．It was the only play possible．When something happens on which you did not count when you made your plans it behooves you to utilise the opportunity that a kindly fate offers you．For one thing，on a bad break like that you have a big market，one that you can turn around in，and that is the time to turn your paper profits into real money．Even in a bear market a man cannot always cover one hundred and twenty thousand shares of stock without putting up the price on himself．He must wait for the market that will allow him to buy that much at no damage to his profit as it stands him on paper．

I should like to point out that I was not counting on that particular break at that particular time for that particular reason．But，as I have told you before，my experience of thirty years as a trader is that such accidents are usually along the line of least resistance on which I base my position in the market．Another thing to bear in mind is this：Never try to sell at the top．It isn't wise．Sell after a reaction if there is no rally．

I cleared about three million dollars in 1916 by being bullish as long as the bull market lasted and then by being bearish when the bear market started．As I said before，a man does not have to marry one side of the market till death do them part．

That winter I went South，to Palm Beach，as I usually do for a vacation，because I am very fond of salt-water fishing．I was short of stocks and wheat，and both lines showed me a handsome profit．There wasn't anything to annoy me and I was having a good time．Of course unless I go to Europe I cannot really be out of touch with the stock or commodities markets．For instance，in the Adirondacks I have a direct wire from my broker's office to my house．

In Palm Beach I used to go to my broker's branch office regularly．I noticed that cotton，in which I had no interest，was strong and rising．About that time—this was in 1917—I heard a great deal about the efforts that President Wilson was making to bring about peace．The reports came from Washington，both in the shape of press dispatches and private advices to friends in Palm Beach．That is the reason why one day I got the notion that the course of the various markets reflected confidence in Mr．Wilson's success．With peace supposedly close at hand，stocks and wheat ought to go down and cotton up．I was all set as far as stocks and wheat went，but I had not done anything in cotton in some time．

At 2：20 that afternoon I did not own a single bale，but at 2：25 my belief that peace was impending made me buy fifteen thousand bales as a starter．I proposed to follow my old system of trading—that is，of buying my full line—which I have already described to you．

That very afternoon，after the market closed，we got the Unrestricted Warfare note．There wasn't anything to do except to wait for the market to open the next day．I recall that at Gridley's that night one of the greatest captains of industry in the country was offering to sell any amount of United States Steel at five points below the closing price that afternoon．There were several Pittsburgh millionaires within hearing．Nobody took the big man's offer．They knew there was bound to be a whopping big break at the opening．

Sure enough，the next morning the stock and commodity markets were in an uproar，as you can imagine．Some stocks opened eight points below the previous night's close．To me that meant a heaven-sent opportunity to cover all my shorts profitably．As I said before，in a bear market it is always wise to cover if complete demoralisation suddenly develops．That is the only way，if you swing a good-sized line，of turning a big paper profit into real money both quickly and without regrettable reductions．For instance，I was short fifty thousand shares of United States Steel alone．Of course I was short of other stocks，and when I saw I had the market to cover in，I did．My profits amounted to about one and a half million dollars．It was not a chance to disregard．

Cotton，of which I was long fifteen thousand bales，bought in the last half hour of the trading the previous afternoon，opened down five hundred points．Some break！It meant an overnight loss of three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars．While it was perfectly clear that the only wise play in stocks and wheat was to cover on the break I was not so clear as to what I ought to do in cotton．There were various things to consider，and while I always take my loss the moment I am convinced I am wrong，I did not like to take that loss that morning．Then I reflected that I had gone South to have a good tune fishing instead of perplexing myself over the course of the cotton market．And，moreover，I had taken such big profits in my wheat and in stocks that I decided to take my loss in cotton．I would figure that my profit had been a little more than one million instead of over a million and a half．It was all a matter of bookkeeping，as promoters are apt to tell you when you ask too many questions．

If I hadn't bought that cotton just before the market closed the day before，I would have saved that four hundred thousand dollars．It shows you how quickly a man may lose big money on a moderate line．My main position was absolutely correct and I benefited by an accident of a nature diametrically opposite to the considerations that led me to take the position I did in stocks and wheat．Observe，please，that the speculative line of least resistance again demonstrated its value to a trader．Prices went as I expected，notwithstanding the unexpected market factor introduced by the German note．If things had turned out as I had figured I would have been 100 per cent right in all three of my lines，for with peace stocks and wheat would have gone down and cotton would have gone kiting up．I would have cleaned up in all three．Irrespective of peace or war，I was right in my position on the stock market and in wheat and that is why the unlooked-for event helped．In cotton I based my play on something that might happen outside of the market—that is，I bet on Mr．Wilson's success in his peace negotiations．It was the German military leaders who made me lose the cotton bet．

When I returned to New York early in 1917 I paid back all the money I owed，which was over a million dollars．It was a great pleasure to me to pay my debts．I might have paid it back a few months earlier，but I didn't for a very simple reason．I was trading actively and successfully and I needed all the capital I had．I owed it to myself as well as to the men I considered my creditors to take every advantage of the wonderful markets we had in 1915 and 1916．I knew that I would make a great deal of money and I wasn't worrying because I was letting them wait a few months longer for money many of them never expected to get back．I did not wish to pay off my obligations in driblets or to one man at a time，but in full to all at once．So as long as the market was doing all it could for me I just kept on trading on as big a scale as my resources permitted．

I wished to pay interest，but all those creditors who had signed releases positively refused to accept it．The man I paid off the last of all was the chap I owed the eight hundred dollars to，who had made my life a burden and had upset me until I couldn't trade．I let him wait until he heard that I had paid off all the others．Then he got his money．I wanted to teach him to be considerate the next time somebody owed him a few hundreds．

And that is how I came back．

After I paid off my debts in full I put a pretty fair amount into annuities．I made up my mind I wasn't going to be strapped and uncomfortable and minus a stake ever again．Of course，after I married I put some money in trust for my wife．And after the boy came I put some in trust for him．

The reason I did this was not alone the fear that the stock market might take it away from me，but because I knew that a man will spend anything he can lay his hands on．By doing what I did my wife and child are safe from me．

More than one man I know has done the same thing，but has coaxed his wife to sign off when he needed the money，and he has lost it．But I have fixed it up so that no matter what I want or what my wife wants，that trust holds．It is absolutely safe from all attacks by either of us；safe from my market needs；safe even from a devoted wife's love．I'm taking no chances！





Chapter XV


AMONG the hazards of speculation the happening of the unexpected— I might even say of the unexpectable—ranks high．There are certain chances that the most prudent man is justified in taking—chances that he must take if he wishes to be more than a mercantile mollusk．Normal business hazards are no worse than the risks a man runs when he goes out of his house into the street or sets out on a railroad journey．When I lose money by reason of some development which nobody could foresee I think no more vindictively of it than I do of an inconveniently timed storm．Life itself from the cradle to the grave is a gamble and what happens to me because I do not possess the gift of second sight I can bear undisturbed．But there have been times in my career as a speculator when I have both been right and played square and nevertheless I have been cheated out of my earnings by the sordid unfairness of unsportsmanlike opponents．

Against misdeeds by crooks，cowards and crowds a quick-thinking or far-sighted business man can protect himself．I have never gone up against downright dishonesty except in a bucket shop or two because even there honesty was the best policy；the big money was in being square and not in welshing．I have never thought it good business to play any game in any place where it was necessary to keep an eye on the dealer because he was likely to cheat if unwatched．But against the whining welsher the decent man is powerless．Fair play is fair play．I could tell you a dozen instances where I have been the victim of my own belief in the sacredness of the pledged word or of the inviolability of a gentlemen's agreement．I shall not do so because no useful purpose can be served thereby．

Fiction writers，clergymen and women are fond of alluding to the floor of the Stock Exchange as a boodlers' battlefield and to Wall Street's daily business as a fight．It is quite dramatic but utterly misleading．I do not think that my business is strife and contest．I never fight either individuals or speculative cliques．I merely differ in opinion—that is，in my reading of basic conditions．What playwrights call battles of business are not fights between human beings．They are merely tests of business vision．I try to stick to facts and facts only，and govern my actions accordingly．That is Bernard M．Baruch's recipe for success in wealth-winning．Sometimes I do not see the facts—all the facts—clearly enough or early enough；or else I do not reason logically．Whenever any of these things happen I lose．I am wrong．And it always costs me money to be wrong．

No reasonable man objects to paying for his mistakes．There are no preferred creditors in mistake-making and no exceptions or exemptions．But I object to losing money when I am right．I do not mean，either，those deals that have cost me money because of sudden changes in the rules of some particular exchange．I have in mind certain hazards of speculation that from time to time remind a man that no profit should be counted safe until it is deposited in your bank to your credit．

After the Great War broke out in Europe there began the rise in the prices of commodities that was to be expected．It was as easy to foresee that as to foresee war inflation．Of course the general advance continued as the war prolonged itself．As you may remember，I was busy“coming back”in 1915．The boom in stocks was there and it was my duty to utilise it．My safest，easiest and quickest big play was in the stock market，and I was lucky，as you know．

By July，1917，I not only had been able to pay off all my debts but was quite a little to the good besides．This meant that I now had the time，the money and the inclination to consider trading in commodities as well as in stocks．For many years I have made it my practice to study all the markets．The advance in commodity prices over the pre-war level ranged from 100 to 400 per cent．There was only one exception，and that was coffee．Of course there was a reason for this．The breaking out of the war meant the closing up of European markets and huge cargoes were sent to this country，which was the one big market．That led in time to an enormous surplus of raw coffee here，and that，in turn，kept the price low．Why，when I first began to consider its speculative possibilities coffee was actually selling below pre-war prices．If the reasons for this anomaly were plain，no less plain was it that the active and increasingly efficient operation by the German and Austrian submarines must mean an appalling reduction in the number of ships available for commercial purposes．This eventually in turn must lead to dwindling imports of coffee．With reduced receipts and an unchanged consumption the surplus stocks must be absorbed，and when that happened the price of coffee must do what the prices of all other commodities had done，which was，go way up．

It didn't require a Sherlock Holmes to size up the situation．Why everybody did not buy coffee I cannot tell you．When I decided to buy it I did not consider it a speculation．It was much more of an investment．I knew it would take time to cash in，but I knew also that it was bound to yield a good profit．That made it a conservative investment operation—a banker's act rather than a gambler's play．

I started my buying operations in the winter of 1917．I took quite a lot of coffee．The market，however，did nothing to speak of．It continued inactive and as for the price，it did not go up as I had expected．The outcome of it all was that I simply carried my line to no purpose for nine long months．My contracts expired then and I sold out all my options．I took a whopping big loss on that deal and yet I was sure my views were sound．I had been clearly wrong in the matter of time，but I was confident that coffee must advance as all commodities had done，so that no sooner had I sold out my line than I started in to buy again．I bought three times as much coffee as I had so unprofitably carried during those nine disappointing months．Of course I bought deferred options—for as long a time as I could get．

I was not so wrong now．As soon as I had taken on my trebled line the market began to go up．People everywhere seemed to realise all of a sudden what was bound to happen in the coffee market．It began to look as if my investment was going to return me a mighty good rate of interest．

The sellers of the contracts I held were roasters，mostly of German names and affiliations，who had bought the coffee in Brazil confidently expecting to bring it to this country．But there were no ships to bring it，and presently they found themselves in the uncomfortable position of having no end of coffee down there and being heavily short of it to me up here．

Please bear in mind that I first became bullish on coffee while the price was practically at a pre-war level，and don't forget that after I bought it I carried it the greater part of a year and then took a big loss on it．The punishment for being wrong is to lose money．The reward for being right is to make money．Being clearly right and carrying a big line，I was justified in expecting to make a killing．It would not take much of an advance to make my profit satisfactory to me，for I was carrying several hundred thousand bags．I don't like to talk about my operations in figures because sometimes they sound rather formidable and people might think I was boasting．As a matter of fact I trade in accordance to my means and always leave myself an ample margin of safety．In this instance I was conservative enough．The reason I bought options so freely was because I couldn't see how I could lose．Conditions were in my favour．I had been made to wait a year，but now I was going to be paid both for my waiting and for being right．I could see the profit coming—fast．There wasn't any cleverness about it．It was simply that I wasn't blind．

Coming sure and fast，that profit of millions！But it never reached me．No；it wasn't side-tracked by a sudden change in conditions．The market did not experience an abrupt reversal of form．Coffee did not pour into the country．What happened？The unexpectable！What had never happened in anybody's experience；what I therefore had no reason to guard against．I added a new one to the long list of hazards of speculation that I must always keep before me．It was simply that the fellows who had sold me the coffee，the shorts，knew what was in store for them，and in their efforts to squirm out of the position into which they had sold themselves，devised a new way of welshing．They rushed to Washington for help，and got it．

Perhaps you remember that the Government had evolved various plans for preventing further profiteering in necessities．You know how most of them worked．Well，the philanthropic coffee shorts appeared before the Price Fixing Committee of the War Industries Board—I think that was the official designation—and made a patriotic appeal to that body to protect the American breakfaster．They asserted that a professional speculator，one Lawrence Livingston，had cornered，or was about to corner，coffee．If his speculative plans were not brought to naught he would take advantage of the conditions created by the war and the American people would be forced to pay exorbitant prices for their daily coffee．It was unthinkable to the patriots who had sold me cargoes of coffee they couldn't find ships for，that one hundred millions of Americans，more or less，should pay tribute to conscienceless speculators．They represented the coffee trade，not the coffee gamblers，and they were willing to help the Government curb profiteering actual or prospective．

Now I have a horror of whiners and I do not mean to intimate that the Price Fixing Committee was not doing its honest best to curb profiteering and wastefulness．But that need not stop me from expressing the opinion that the committee could not have gone very deeply into the particular problem of the coffee market．They fixed on a maximum price for raw coffee and also fixed a time limit for closing out all existing contracts．This decision meant，of course，that the Coffee Exchange would have to go out of business．There was only one thing for me to do and I did it，and that was to sell out all my contracts．Those profits of millions that I had deemed as certain to come my way as any I ever made failed completely to materialise．I was and am as keen as anybody against the profiteer in the necessaries of life，but at the time the Price Fixing Committee made their ruling on coffee，all other commodities were selling at from 250 to 400 per cent above pre-war prices while raw coffee was actually below the average prevailing for some years before the war．I can't see that it made any real difference who held the coffee．The price was bound to advance；and the reason for that was not the operations of conscienceless speculators，but the dwindling surplus for which the diminishing importations were responsible，and they in turn were affected exclusively by the appalling destruction of the world's ships by the German submarines．The committee did not wait for coffee to start；they clamped on the brakes．

As a matter of policy and of expediency it was a mistake to force the Coffee Exchange to close just then．If the committee had let coffee alone the price undoubtedly would have risen for the reasons I have already stated，which had nothing to do with any alleged corner．But the high price—which need not have been exorbitant—would have been an incentive to attract supplies to this market．I have heard Mr．Bernard M．Baruch say that the War Industries Board took into consideration this factor—the insuring of a supply—in fixing prices，and for that reason some of the complaints about the high limit on certain commodities were unjust．When the Coffee Exchange resumed business，later on，coffee sold at twenty-three cents．The American people paid that price because of the small supply，and the supply was small because the price had been fixed too low，at the suggestion of philanthropic shorts，to make it possible to pay the high ocean freights and thus insure continued importations．

I have always thought that my coffee deal was the most legitimate of all my trades in commodities．I considered it more of an investment than a speculation．I was in it over a year．If there was any gambling it was done by the patriotic roasters with German names and ancestry．They had coffee in Brazil and they sold it to me in New York．The Price Fixing Committee fixed the price of the only commodity that had not advanced．They protected the public against profiteering before it started，but not against the inevitable higher prices that followed．Not only that，but even when green coffee hung around nine cents a pound，roasted coffee went up with everything else．It was only the roasters who benefited．If the price of green coffee had gone up two or three cents a pound it would have meant several millions for me．And it wouldn't have cost the public as much as the later advance did．

Post-mortems in speculation are a waste of time．They get you nowhere．But this particular deal has a certain educational value．It was as pretty as any I ever went into．The rise was so sure，so logical，that I figured that I simply couldn't help making several millions of dollars．But I didn't．

On two other occasions I have suffered from the action of exchange committees making rulings that changed trading rules without warning．But in those cases my own position，while technically right，was not quite so sound commercially as in my coffee trade．You cannot be dead sure of anything in a speculative operation．It was the experience I have just told you that made me add the unexpectable to the unexpected in my list of hazards．

After the coffee episode I was so successful in other commodities and on the short side of the stock market，that I began to suffer from silly gossip．The professionals in Wall Street and the newspaper writers got the habit of blaming me and my alleged raids for the inevitable breaks in prices．At times my selling was called unpatriotic—whether I was really selling or not．The reason for exaggerating the magnitude and the effect of my operations，I suppose，was the need to satisfy the public's insatiable demand for reasons for each and every price movement．

As I have said a thousand times，no manipulation can put stocks down and keep them down．There is nothing mysterious about this．The reason is plain to everybody who will take the trouble to think about it half a minute．Suppose an operator raided a stock—that is，put the price down to a level below its real value—what would inevitably happen？Why，the raider would at once be up against the best kind of inside buying．The people who know what a stock is worth will always buy it when it is selling at bargain prices．If the insiders are not able to buy，it will be because general conditions are against their free command of their own resources，and such conditions are not bull conditions．When people speak about raids the inference is that the raids are unjustified；almost criminal．But selling a stock down to a price much below what it is worth is mighty dangerous business．It is well to bear in mind that a raided stock that fails to rally is not getting much inside buying and where there is a raid— that is，unjustified short selling—there is usually apt to be inside buying；and when there is that，the price does not stay down．I should say that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred，so-called raids are really legitimate declines，accelerated at times but not primarily caused by the operations of a professional trader，however big a line he may be able to swing．

The theory that most of the sudden declines or particular sharp breaks are the results of some plunger's operations probably was invented as an easy way of supplying reasons to those speculators who，being nothing but blind gamblers，will believe anything that is told them rather than do a little thinking．The raid excuse for losses that unfortunate speculators so often receive from brokers and financial gossipers is really an inverted tip．The difference lies in this：A bear tip is distinct，positive advice to sell short．But the inverted tip—that is，the explanation that does not explain—serves merely to keep you from wisely selling short．The natural tendency when a stock breaks badly is to sell it．There is a reason—an unknown reason but a good reason；therefore get out．But it is not wise to get out when the break is the result of a raid by an operator，because the moment he stops the price must rebound．Inverted tips！





Chapter XVI


TIPS！How people want tips！They crave not only to get them but to give them．There is greed involved，and vanity．It is very amusing，at times，to watch really intelligent people fish for them．And the tip-giver need not hesitate about the quality，for the tip-seeker is not really after good tips，but after any tip．If it makes good，fine！If it doesn't，better luck with the next．I am thinking of the average customer of the average commission house．There is a type of promoter or manipulator that believes in tips first，last and all the time．A good flow of tips is considered by him as a sort of sublimated publicity work，the best merchandising dope in the world，for，since tip-seekers and tip-takers are invariably tip-passers，tip-broadcasting becomes a sort of endless—chain advertising．The tipster-promoter labours under the delusion that no human being breathes who can resist a tip if properly delivered．He studies the art of handing them out artistically．

I get tips by the hundreds every day from all sorts of people．I'll tell you a story about Borneo Tin．You remember when the stock was brought out？It was at the height of the boom．The promoter's pool had taken the advice of a very clever banker and decided to float the new company in the open market at once instead of letting an underwriting syndicate take its time about it．It was good advice．The only mistake the members of the pool made came from inexperience．They did not know what the stock market was capable of doing during a crazy boom and at the same time they were not intelligently liberal．They were agreed on the need of marking up the price in order to market the stock，but they started the trading at a figure at which the traders and the speculative pioneers could not buy it without misgivings．

By rights the promoters ought to have got stuck with it，but in the wild bull market their hoggishness turned out to be rank conservatism．The public was buying anything that was adequately tipped．Investments were not wanted．The demand was for easy money；for the sure gambling profit．Gold was pouring into this country through the huge purchases of war material．They tell me that the promoters，while making their plans for bringing out Borneo stock，marked up the opening price three different times before their first transaction was officially recorded for the benefit of the public．

I had been approached to join the pool and I had looked into it but I didn't accept the offer because if there is any market manoeuvring to do，I like to do it myself．I trade on my own information and follow my own methods．When Borneo Tin was brought out，knowing what the pool's resources were and what they had planned to do，and also knowing what the public was capable of，I bought ten thousand shares during the first hour of the first day．Its market début was successful at least to that extent．As a matter of fact the promoters found the demand so active that they decided it would be a mistake to lose so much stock so soon．They found out that I had acquired my ten thousand shares about at the same time that they found out that they would probably be able to sell every share they owned if they merely marked up the price twenty-five or thirty points．They therefore concluded that the profit on my ten thousand shares would take too big a chunk out of the millions they felt were already as good as banked．So they actually ceased their bull operations and tried to shake me out．But I simply sat tight．They gave me up as a bad job because they didn't want the market to get away from them，and then they began to put up the price，without losing any more stock than they could help．

They saw the crazy height that other stocks rose to and they began to think in billions．Well，when Borneo Tin got up to 120 I let them have my ten thousand shares．It checked the rise and the pool managers let up on their jacking-up process．On the next general rally they again tried to make an active market for it and disposed of quite a little，but the merchandising proved to be rather expensive．Finally they marked it up to 150．But the bloom was off the bull market for keeps，so the pool was compelled to market what stock it could on the way down to those people who love to buy after a good reaction，on the fallacy that a stock that has once sold at 150 must be cheap at 130 and a great bargain at 120．Also，they passed the tip first to the floor traders，who often are able to make a temporary market，and later to the commission houses．Every little helped and the pool was using every device known．The trouble was that the time for bulling stocks had passed．The suckers had swallowed other hooks．The Borneo bunch didn't or wouldn't see it．

I was down in Palm Beach with my wife．One day I made a little money at Gridley's and when I got home I gave Mrs．Livingston a five-hundred-dollar bill out of it．It was a curious coincidence，but that same night she met at a dinner the president of the Borneo Tin Company，a Mr．Wisenstein，who had become the manager of the stock pool．We didn't learn until some time afterward that this Wisenstein deliberately manoeuvred so that he sat next to Mrs．Livingston at dinner．

He laid himself out to be particularly nice to her and talked most entertainingly．In the end he told her，very confidentially，“Mrs．Livingston，I'm going to do something I've never done before．I am very glad to do it because you know exactly what it means．”He stopped and looked at Mrs．Livingston anxiously，to make sure she was not only wise but discreet．She could read it on his face，plain as print．But all she said was，“Yes．”

“Yes，Mrs．Livingston．It has been a very great pleasure to meet you and your husband，and I want to prove that I am sincere in saying this because I hope to see a great deal of both of you．I am sure I don't have to tell you that what I am going to say is strictly confidential！”Then he whispered，“If you will buy some Borneo Tin you will make a great deal of money．”

“Do you think so？”she asked．

“Just before I left the hotel，”he said，“I received some cables with news that won't be known to the public for several days at least．I am going to gather in as much of the stock as I can．If you get some at the opening tomorrow you will be buying it at the same time and at the same price as I．I give you my word that Borneo Tin will surely advance．You are the only person that I have told this to．Absolutely the only one ！”

She thanked him and then she told him that she didn't know anything about speculating in stocks．But he assured her it wasn't necessary for her to know any more than he had told her．To make sure she heard it correctly he repeated his advice to her：

“All you have to do is to buy as much Borneo Tin as you wish．I can give you my word that if you do you will not lose a cent．I've never before told a woman—or a man，for that matter—to buy anything in my life．But I am so sure the stock won't stop this side of 200 that I'd like you to make some money．I can't buy all the stock myself，you know，and if somebody besides myself is going to benefit by the rise I'd rather it was you than some stranger．Much rather！I've told you in confidence because I know you won't talk about it．Take my word for it，Mrs．Livingston，and buy Borneo Tin！”

He was very earnest about it and succeeded in so impressing her that she began to think she had found an excellent use for the five hundred dollars I had given her that afternoon．That money hadn't cost me anything and was outside of her allowance．In other words，it was easy money to lose if the luck went against her．But he had said she would surely win．It would be nice to make money on her own hook—and tell me all about it afterwards．

Well，sir，the very next morning before the market opened she went into Harding's office and said to the manager：

“Mr．Haley，I want to buy some stock，but I don't want it to go in my regular account because I don't wish my husband to know anything about it until I've made some money．Can you fix it for me？”

Haley，the manager，said，“Oh，yes．We can make it a special account．What's the stock and how much of it do you want to buy？”

She gave him the five hundred dollars and told him，“Listen，please．I do not wish to lose more than this money．If that goes I don't want to owe you anything；and remember，I don't want Mr．Livingston to know anything about this．Buy me as much Borneo Tin as you can for the money，at the opening．”

Haley took the money and told her he'd never say a word to a soul，and bought her a hundred shares at the opening．I think she got it at 108．The stock was very active that day and closed at an advance of three points．Mrs．Livingston was so delighted with her exploit that it was all she could do to keep from telling me all about it．

It so happened that I had been getting more and more bearish on the general market．The unusual activity in Borneo Tin drew my attention to it．I didn't think the time was right for any stock to advance，much less one like that．I had decided to begin my bear operations that very day，and I started by selling about ten thousand shares of Borneo．If I had not I rather think the stock would have gone up five or six points instead of three．

On the very next day I sold two thousand shares at the opening and two thousand shares just before the close，and the stock broke to 102．

Haley，the manager of Harding Brothers' Palm Beach Branch，was waiting for Mrs．Livingston to call there on the third morning．She usually strolled in about eleven to see how things were，if I was doing anything．

Haley took her aside and said，“Mrs．Livingston，if you want me to carry that hundred shares of Borneo Tin for you you will have to give me more margin．”

“But I haven't any more，”she told him．

“I can transfer it to your regular account，”he said．

“No，”she objected，“because that way L．L．would learn about it．”

“But the account already shows a loss of—”he began．

“But I told you distinctly I didn't want to lose more than the five hundred dollars．I didn't even want to lose that，”she said．

“I know，Mrs．Livingston，but I didn't want to sell it without consulting you，and now unless you authorise me to hold it I'll have to let it go．”

“But it did so nicely the day I bought it，”she said，“that I didn't believe it would act this way so soon．Did you？”

“No，”answered Haley，“I didn't．”They have to be diplomatic in brokers' offices．

“What's gone wrong with it，Mr．Haley？”

Haley knew，but he could not tell her without giving me away，and a customer's business is sacred．So he said，“I don't hear anything special about it，one way or another．There she goes！That's low for the move！”and he pointed to the quotation board．

Mrs．Livingston gazed at the sinking stock and cried：“Oh，Mr．Haley！I didn't want to lose my five hundred dollars！What shall I do？”

“I don't know，Mrs．Livingston，but if I were you I'd ask Mr．Livingston．”

“Oh，no！He doesn't want me to speculate on my own hook．He's told me so．He'll buy or sell stock for me，if I ask him，but I've never before done trading that he did not know all about．I wouldn't dare tell him．”

“That's all right，”said Haley soothingly．“He is a wonderful trader and he'll know just what to do．”Seeing her shake her head violently he added devilishly：“Or else you put up a thousand or two to take care of your Borneo．”

The alternative decided her then and there．She hung about the office，but as the market got weaker and weaker she came over to where I sat watching the board and told me she wanted to speak to me．We went into the private office and she told me the whole story．So I just said to her：“You foolish little girl，you keep your hands off this deal．”

She promised that she would，and so I gave her back her five hundred dollars and she went away happy．The stock was par by that time．

I saw what had happened．Wisenstein was an astute person．He figured that Mrs．Livingston would tell one what he had told her and I'd study the stock．He knew that activity always attracted me and I was known to swing a pretty fair line．I suppose he thought I'd buy ten or twenty thousand shares．

It was one of the most cleverly planned and artistically propelled tips I've ever heard of．But it went wrong．It had to．In the first place，the lady had that very day received an unearned five hundred dollars and was therefore in a much more venturesome mood than usual．She wished to make some money all by herself，and womanlike dramatised the temptation so attractively that it was irresistible．She knew how I felt about stock speculation as practised by outsiders，and she didn't dare mention the matter to me．Wisenstein didn't size up her psychology right．

He also was utterly wrong in his guess about the kind of trader I was．I never take tips and I was bearish on the entire market．The tactics that he thought would prove effective in inducing me to buy Borneo—that is，the activity and the three-point rise—were precisely what made me pick Borneo as a starter when I decided to sell the entire market．

After I heard Mrs．Livingston's story I was keener than ever to sell Borneo．Every morning at the opening and every afternoon just before closing I let him have some stock regularly，until I saw a chance to take in my shorts at a handsome profit．

It has always seemed to me the height of damfoolishness to trade on tips．I suppose I am not built the way a tip-taker is．I sometimes think that tip-takers are like drunkards．There are some who can't resist the craving and always look forward to those jags which they consider indispensable to their happiness．It is so easy to open your ears and let the tip in．To be told precisely what to do to be happy in such a manner that you can eagily obey is the next nicest thing to being happy—which is a mighty long first step toward the fulfilment of your heart's desire．It is not so much greed made blind by eagerness as it is hope bandaged by the unwillingness to do any thinking．

And it is not only among the outside public that you find inveterate tip-takers．The professional trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange is quite as bad．I am definitely aware that no end of them cherish mistaken notions of me because I never give anybody tips．If I told the average man，“Sell yourself five thousand Steel！”he would do it on the spot．But if I tell him I am quite bearish on the entire market and give him my reasons in detail，he finds trouble in listening and after I'm done talking he will glare at me for wasting his time expressing my views on general conditions instead of giving him a direct and specific tip，like a real philanthropist of the type that is so abundant in Wall Street—the sort who loves to put millions into the pockets of friends，acquaintances and utter strangers alike．

The belief in miracles that all men cherish is born of immoderate indulgence in hope．There are people who go on hope sprees periodically and we all know the chronic hope drunkard that is held up before us as an exemplary optimist．Tip-takers are all they really are．

I have an acquaintance，a member of the New York Stock Exchange，who was one of those who thought I was a selfish，cold-blooded pig because I never gave tips or put friends into things．One day—this was some years ago—he was talking to a newspaper man who casually mentioned that he had had it from a good source that G．O．H．was going up．My broker friend promptly bought a thousand shares and saw the price decline so quickly that he was out thirty-five hundred dollars before he could stop his loss．He met the newspaper man a day or two later，while he still was sore．

“That was a hell of a tip you gave me，”he complained．

“What tip was that？”asked the reporter，who did not remember．

“About G．O．H．You said you had it from a good source．”

“So I did．A director of the company who is a member of the finance committee told me．”

“Which of them was it？”asked the broker vindictively．

“If you must know，”answered the newspaper man，“it was your own father-in-law，Mr．Westlake．”

“Why in Hades didn't you tell me you meant him！”yelled the broker．“You cost me thirty-five hundred dollars！”He didn't believe in family tips．The farther away the source the purer the tip．

Old Westlake was a rich and successful banker and promoter．He ran across John W．Gates one day．Gates asked him what he knew．“If you will act on it I'll give you a tip．If you won't I'll save my breath，”answered old Westlake grumpily．

“Of course I'll act on it，”promised Gates cheerfully．

“Sell Reading！There is a sure twenty-five points in it，and possibly more．But twenty-five absolutely certain，”said Westlake impressively．

“I'm much obliged to you，”and Bet-you-a-million Gates shook hands warmly and went away in the direction of his broker's office．

Westlake had specialized on Reading．He knew all about the company and stood in with the insiders so that the market for the stock was an open book to him and everybody knew it．Now he was advising the Western plunger to go short of it．

Well，Reading never stopped going up．It rose something like one hundred points in a few weeks．One day old Westlake ran smack up against John W．in the Street，but he made out he hadn't seen him and was walking on．John W．Gates caught up with him，his face all smiles and held out his hand．Old Westlake shook it dazedly．

“I want to thank you for that tip you gave me on Reading，”said Gates．

“I didn't give you any tip，”said Westlake，frowning．

“Sure you did．And it was a Jim Hickey of a tip too．I made sixty thousand dollars．”

“Made sixty thousand dollars？”

“Sure！Don't you remember？You told me to sell Reading；so I bought it！I've always made money coppering your tips，Westlake，”said John W．Gates pleasantly．“Always！”

Old Westlake looked at the bluff Westerner and presently remarked admiringly，“Gates，what a rich man I'd be if I had your brains！”

The other day I met Mr．W．A．Rogers，the famous cartoonist，whose Wall Street drawings brokers so greatly admire．His daily cartoons in the New York Herald for years gave pleasure to thousands．Well，he told me a story．It was just before we went to war with Spain．He was spending an evening with a broker friend．When he left he picked up his derby hat from the rack，at least he thought it was his hat，for it was the same shape and fitted him perfectly．

The Street at that time was thinking and talking of nothing but war with Spain．Was there to be one or not？If it was to be war the market would go down；not so much on our own selling as on pressure from European holders of our securities．If peace，it would be a cinch to buy stocks，as there had been considerable declines prompted by the sensational clamorings of the yellow papers．Mr．Rogers told me the rest of the story as follows：

“My friend，the broker，at whose house I had been the night before，stood in the Exchange the next day anxiously debating in his mind which side of the market to play．He went over the pros and cons，but it was impossible to distinguish which were rumours and which were facts．There was no authentic news to guide him．At one moment he thought war was inevitable，and on the next he almost convinced himself that it was utterly unlikely．His perplexity must have caused a rise in his temperature，for he took off his derby to wipe his fevered brow．He couldn't tell whether he should buy or sell．

“He happened to look inside of his hat．There in gold letters was the word WAR．That was all the hunch he needed．Was it not a tip from Providence via my hat？So he sold a raft of stock，war was duly declared，he covered on the break and made a killing．”And then W．A．Rogers finished，“I never got back that hat！”

But the prize tip story of my collection concerns one of the most popular members of the New York Stock Exchange，J．T．Hood．One day another floor trader，Bert Walker，told him that he had done a good turn to a prominent director of the Atlantic & Southern．In return the grateful insider told him to buy all the A．& S．he could carry．The directors were going to do something that would put the stock up at least twenty-five points．All the directors were not in the deal，but the majority would be sure to vote as wanted．

Bert Walker concluded that the dividend rate was going to be raised．He told his friend Hood and they each bought a couple of thousand shares of A．& S．The stock was very weak，before and after they bought，but Hood said that was obviously intended to facilitate accumulation by the inside clique，headed by Bert's grateful friend．

On the following Thursday，after the market closed，the directors of the Atlantic & Southern met and passed the dividend．The stock broke six points in the first six minutes of trading Friday morning．

Bert Walker was sore as a pup．He called on the grateful director，who was broken-hearted about it and very penitent．He said that he had forgotten that he had told Walker to buy．That was the reason he had neglected to call him up to tell him of a change in the plans of the dominant faction in the board．The remorseful director was so anxious to make up that he gave Bert another tip．He kindly explained that a couple of his colleagues wanted to get cheap stock and against his judgment resorted to coarse work．He had to yield to win their votes．But now that they all had accumulated their full lines there was nothing to stop the advance．It was a double-riveted，lead-pipe cinch to buy A．& S．now．

Bert not only forgave him but shook hands warmly with the high financier．Naturally he hastened to find his friend and fellow victim，Hood，to impart the glad tidings to him．They were going to make a killing．The stock had been tipped for a rise before and they bought．But now it was fifteen points lower．That made it a cinch．So they bought five thousand shares，joint account．

As if they had rung a bell to start it，the stock broke badly on what quite obviously was inside selling．Two specialists cheerfully confirmed the suspicion．Hood sold out their five thousand shares．When he got through Bert Walker said to him，“If that blankety-blank blanker hadn't gone to Florida day before yesterday I'd lick the stuffing out of him．Yes，I would．But you come with me．”

“Where to？”asked Hood．

“To the telegraph office．I want to send that skunk a telegram that he'll never forget．Come on．”

Hood went on．Bert led the way to the telegraph office．There，carried away by his feelings—they had taken quite a loss on the five thousand shares—he composed a masterpiece of vituperation．He read it to Hood and finished，“That will come pretty near to showing him what I think of him．”

He was about to slide it toward the waiting clerk when Hood said，“Hold on，Bert！”

“What's the matter？”

“I wouldn't send it，”advised Hood earnestly．

“Why not？”snapped Bert．

“It will make him sore as the dickens．”

“That's what we want，isn't it？”said Bert，looking at Hood in surprise．

But Hood shook his head disapprovingly and said in all seriousness，“We'll never get another tip from him if you send that telegram！”

A professional trader actually said that．Now what's the use of talking about sucker tip-takers？Men do not take tips because they are bally asses but because they like those hope cocktails I spoke of．Old Baron Rothschild's recipe for wealth winning applies with greater force than ever to speculation．Somebody asked him if making money in the Bourse was not a very difficult matter，and he replied that，on the contrary，he thought it was very easy．

“That is because you are so rich，”objected the interviewer．

“Not at all．I have found an easy way and I stick to it．I simply cannot help making money．I will tell you my secret if you wish．It is this：I never buy at the bottom and I always sell too soon．”

Investors are a different breed of cats．Most of them go in strong for inventories and statistics of earnings and all sorts of mathematical data，as though that meant facts and certainties．The human factor is minimised as a rule．Very few people like to buy into a one-man business．But the wisest investor I ever knew was a man who began by being a Pennsylvania Dutchman and followed it up by coming to Wall Street and seeing a great deal of Russell Sage．

He was a great investigator，an indefatigable Missourian．He believed in asking his own questions and in doing his seeing with his own eyes．He had no use for another man's spectacles．This was years ago．It seems he held quite a little Atchison．Presently he began to hear disquieting reports about the company and its management．He was told that Mr．Reinhart，the president，instead of being the marvel he was credited with being，in reality was a most extravagant manager whose recklessness was fast pushing the company into a mess．There would be the deuce to pay on the inevitable day of reckoning．

This was precisely the kind of news that was as the breath of life to the Pennsylvania Dutchman．He hurried over to Boston to interview Mr．Reinhart and ask him a few questions．The questions consisted of repeating the accusations he had heard and then asking the president of the Atchison，Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad if they were true．

Mr．Reinhart not only denied the allegations emphatically but said even more：He proceeded to prove by figures that the allegators were malicious liars．The Pennsylvania Dutchman had asked for exact information and the president gave it to him，showing him what the company was doing and how it stood financially，to a cent．

The Pennsylvania Dutchman thanked President Reinhart，returned to New York and promptly sold all his Atchison holdings．A week or so later he used his idle funds to buy a big lot of Delaware，Lackawanna & Western．

Years afterward we were talking of lucky swaps and he cited his own case．He explained what prompted him to make it．

“You see，”he said，“I noticed that President Reinhart，when he wrote down figures，took sheets of letter paper from a pigeonhole in his mahogany roll-top desk．It was fine heavy linen paper with beautifully engraved letterheads in two colors．It was not only very expensive but worse—it was unnecessarily expensive．He would write a few figures on a sheet to show me exactly what the company was earning on certain divisions or to prove how they were cutting down expenses or reducing operating costs，and then he would crumple up the sheet of the expensive paper and throw it in the waste-basket．Pretty soon he would want to impress me with the economies they were introducing and he would reach for a fresh sheet of the beautiful notepaper with the engraved letterheads in two colors．A few figures—and bingo，into the waste-basket！More money wasted without a thought．It struck me that if the president was that kind of a man he would scarcely be likely to insist upon having or rewarding economical assistants．I therefore decided to believe the people who had told me the management was extravagant instead of accepting the president's version and I sold what Atchison stock I held．

“It so happened that I had occasion to go to the offices of the Delaware，Lackawanna & Western a few days later．Old Sam Sloan was the president．His office was the nearest to the entrance and his door was wide open．It was always open．Nobody could walk into the general offices of the D．L．& W．in those days and not see the president of the company seated at his desk．Any man could walk in and do business with him right off，if he had any business to do．The financial reporters used to tell me that they never had to beat about the bush with old Sam Sloan，but would ask their questions and get a straight yes or no from him，no matter what the stock-market exigencies of the other directors might be．

“When I walked in I saw the old man was busy．I thought at first that he was opening his mail，but after I got inside close to the desk I saw what he was doing．I learned afterwards that it was his daily custom to do it．After the mail was sorted and opened，instead of throwing away the empty envelopes he had them gathered up and taken to his office．In his leisure moments he would rip the envelope all around．That gave him two bits of paper，each with one clean blank side．He would pile these up and then he would have them distributed about，to be used in lieu of scratch pads for such figuring as Reinhart had done for me on engraved notepaper．No waste of empty envelopes and no waste of the president's idle moments．Everything utilised．

“It struck me that if that was the kind of man the D．L．& W．had for president，the company was managed economically in all departments．The president would see to that！Of course I knew the company was paying regular dividends and had a good property．I bought all the D．L．& W．stock I could．Since that time the capital stock has been doubled and quadrupled．My annual dividends amount to as much as my original investment．I still have my D．L．& W．And Atchison went into the hands of a receiver a few months after I saw the president throwing sheet after sheet of linen paper with engraved letterheads in two colors into the wasteb-asket to prove to me with figures that he was not extravagant．”

And the beauty of that story is that it is true and that no other stock that the Pennsylvania Dutchman could have bought would have proved to be so good an investment as D．L．& W．





Chapter XVII


ONE of my most intimate friends is very fond of telling stories about what he calls my hunches．He is forever ascribing to me powers that defy analysis．Ile declares I merely follow blindly certain mysterious impulses and thereby get out of the stock market at precisely the right time．His pet yarn is about a black cat that told me，at his breakfast-table，to sell a lot of stock I was carrying，and that after I got the pussy's message I was grouchy and nervous until I sold every share I was long of．I got practically the top prices of the movement，which of course strengthened the hunch theory of my hard-headed friend．

I had gone to Washington to endeavor to convince a few Congressmen that there was no wisdom in taxing us to death and I wasn't paying much attention to the stock market．My decision to sell out my line came suddenly，hence my friend's yarn．

I admit that I do get irresistible impulses at times to do certain things in the market．It doesn't matter whether I am long or short of stocks．I must get out．I am uncomfortable until I do．I myself think that what happens is that I see a lot of warning-signals．Perhaps not a single one may be sufficiently clear or powerful to afford me a positive，definite reason for doing what I suddenly feel like doing．Probably that is all there is to what they call“ticker-sense”that old traders say James R．Keene had so strongly developed and other operators before him．Usually，I confess，the warning turns out to be not only sound but timed to the minute．But in this particular instance there was no hunch．The black cat had nothing to do with it．What he tells everybody about my getting up so grumpy that morning I suppose can be explained—if I in truth was grouchy—by my disappointment．I knew I was not convincing the Congressman I talked to and the Committee did not view the problem of taxing Wall Street as I did．I wasn't trying to arrest or evade taxation on stock transactions but to suggest a tax that I as an experienced stock operator felt was neither unfair nor unintelligent．I didn't want Uncle Sam to kill the goose that could lay so many golden eggs with fair treatment．Possibly my lack of success not only irritated me but made me pessimistic over the future of an unfairly taxed business．But I'll tell you exactly what happened．

At the beginning of the bull market I thought well of the outlook in both the Steel trade and the copper market and I therefore felt bullish on stocks of both groups．So I started to accumulate some of them．I began by buying 5000 shares of Utah Copper and stopped because it didn't act right．That is，it did not behave as it should have behaved to make me feel I was wise in buying it．I think the price was around 114．I also started to buy United States Steel at almost the same price．I bought in all 20,000 shares the first day because it did act right．I followed the method I have described before．

Steel continued to act right and I therefore continued to accumulate it until I was carrying 72,000 shares of it in all．But my holdings of Utah Copper consisted of my initial purchase．I never got above the 5000 shares．Its behaviour did not encourage me to do more with it．

Everybody knows what happened．We had a big bull movement．I knew the market was going up．General conditions were favourable．Even after stocks had gone up extensively and my paper-profit was not to be sneezed at，the tape kept trumpeting：Not yet！Not yet！When I arrived in Washington the tape was still saying that to me．Of course，I had no intention of increasing my line at that late day，even though I was still bullish．At the same time，the market was plainly going my way and there was no occasion for me to sit in front of a quotation board all day，in hourly expectation of getting a tip to get out．Before the clarion call to retreat came—barring an utterly unexpected catastrophe，of course—the market would hesitate or otherwise prepare me for a reversal of the speculative situation．That was the reason why I went blithely about my business with my Congressmen．

At the same time，prices kept going up and that meant that the end of the bull market was drawing nearer．I did not look for the end on any fixed date．That was something quite beyond my power to determine．But I needn't tell you that I was on the watch for the tip-off．I always am，anyhow．It has become a matter of business habit with me．

I cannot swear to it but I rather suspect that the day before I sold out，seeing the high prices made me think of the magnitude of my paper-profit as well as of the line I was carrying and，later on，of my vain efforts to induce our legislators to deal fairly and intelligently by Wall Street．That was probably the way and the time the seed was sown within me．The subconscious mind worked on it all night．In the morning I thought of the market and began to wonder how it would act that day．When I went down to the office I saw not so much that prices were still higher and that I had a satisfying profit but that there was a great big market with a tremendous power of absorption．I could sell any amount of stock in that market；and，of course，when a man is carrying his full line of stocks，he must be on the watch for an opportunity to change his paper profit into actual cash．He should try to lose as little of the profit as possible in the swapping．Experience has taught me that a man can always find an opportunity to make his profits real and that this opportunity usually comes at the end of the move．That isn't tape-reading or a hunch．

Of course，when I found that morning a market in which I could sell out all my stocks without any trouble I did so．When you are selling out it is no wiser or braver to sell fifty shares than fifty thousand；but fifty shares you can sell in the dullest market without breaking the price and fifty thousand shares of a single stock is a different proposition．I had seventy-two thousand shares of U．S．Steel．This may not seem a colossal line，but you can't always sell that much without losing some of that profit that looks so nice on paper when you figure it out and that hurts as much to lose as if you actually had it safe in bank．

I had a total profit of about $1,500,000 and I grabbed it while the grabbing was good．But that wasn't the principal reason for thinking that I did the right thing in selling out when I did．The market proved it for me and that was indeed a source of satisfaction to me．It was this way：I succeeded in selling my entire line of seventy-two thousand shares of U．S．Steel at a price which averaged me just one point from the top of the day and of the movement．It proved that I was right，to the minute．But when，on the very same hour of the very same day I came to sell my 5000 Utah Copper，the price broke five points．Please recall that I began buying both stocks at the same time and that I acted wisely in increasing my line of U．S．Steel from twenty thousand shares to seventy-two thousand，and equally wisely in not increasing my line of Utah from the original 5000 shares．The reason why I didn't sell out my Utah Copper before was that I was bullish on the copper trade and it was a bull market in stocks and I didn't think that Utah would hurt me much even if I didn't make a killing in it．But as for hunches，there weren't any．

The training of a stock trader is like a medical education．The physician has to spend long years learning anatomy，physiology，materia medica and collateral subjects by the dozen．He learns the theory and then proceeds to devote his life to the practice．He observes and classifies all sorts of pathological phenomena．He learns to diagnose．If his diagnosis is correct—and that depends upon the accuracy of his observation—he ought to do pretty well in his prognosis，always keeping in mind，of course，that human fallibility and the utterly unforeseen will keep him from scoring 100 per cent of bull's-eyes．And then，as he gains in experience，he learns not only to do the right thing but to do it instantly，so that many people will think he does it instinctively．It really isn't automatism．It is that he has diagnosed the case according to his observations of such cases during a period of many years；and，naturally，after he has diagnosed it，he can only treat it in the way that experience has taught him is the proper treatment．You can transmit knowledge—that is，your particular collection of card-indexed facts—but not your experience．A man may know what to do and lose money—if he doesn't do it quickly enough．

Observation，experience，memory and mathematics—these are what the successful trader must depend on．He must not only observe accurately but remember at all times what he has observed．He cannot bet on the unreasonable or on the unexpected，however strong his personal convictions may be about man's unreasonableness or however certain he may feel that the unexpected happens very frequently．He must bet always on probabilities—that is，try to anticipate them．Years of practice at the game，of constant study，of always remembering，enable the trader to act on the instant when the unexpected happens as well as when the expected comes to pass．

A man can have great mathematical ability and an unusual power of accurate observation and yet fail in speculation unless he also possesses the experience and the memory．And then，like the physician who keeps up with the advances of science，the wise trader never ceases to study general conditions，to keep track of developments everywhere that are likely to affect or influence the course of the various markets．After years at the game it becomes a habit to keep posted．He acts almost automatically．He acquires the invaluable professional attitude and that enables him to beat the game—at times！This difference between the professional and the amateur or occasional trader cannot be overemphasised．I find，for instance，that memory and mathematics help me very much．Wall Street makes its money on a mathematical basis．I mean，it makes its money by dealing with facts and figures．

When I said that a trader has to keep posted to the minute and that he must take a purely professional attitude toward all markets and all developments，I merely meant to emphasise again that hunches and the mysterious ticker-sense haven't so very much to do with success．Of course，it often happens that an experienced trader acts so quickly that he hasn't time to give all his reasons in advance—but nevertheless they are good and sufficient reasons，because they are based on facts collected by him in his years of working and thinking and seeing things from the angle of the professional，to whom everything that comes to his mill is grist．Let me illustrate what I mean by the professional attitude．

I keep track of the commodities markets，always．It is a habit of years．As you know，the Government reports indicated a winter wheat crop about the same as last year and a bigger spring wheat crop than in 1921．The condition was much better and we probably would have an earlier harvest than usual．When I got the figures of condition and I saw what we might expect in the way of yield—mathematics—I also thought at once of the coal miners' strike and the railroad shopmen's strike．I couldn't help thinking of them because my mind always thinks of all developments that have a bearing on the markets．It instantly struck me that the strike which had already affected the movement of freight everywhere must affect wheat prices adversely．I figured this way：There was bound to be considerable delay in moving winter wheat to market by reason of the strike-crippled transportation facilities，and by the time those improved the Spring wheat crop would be ready to move．That meant that when the railroads were able to move wheat in quantity they would be bringing in both crops together—the delayed winter and the early spring wheat—and that would mean a vast quantity of wheat pouring into the market at one fell swoop．Such being the facts of the case—the obvious probabilities—the traders，who would know and figure as I did，would not bull wheat for a while．They would not feel like buying it unless the price declined to such figures as made the purchase of wheat a good investment．With no buying power in the market，the price ought to go down．Thinking the way I did I must find whether I was right or not．As old Pat Hearne used to remark，“You can't tell till you bet．”Between being bearish and selling there is no need to waste time．

Experience has taught me that the way a market behaves is an excellent guide for an operator to follow．It is like taking a patient's temperature and pulse or noting the colour of the eyeballs and the coating of the tongue．

Now，ordinarily a man ought to be able to buy or sell a million bushels of wheat within a range of ¼ cent．On this day when I sold the 250,000 bushels to test the market for timeliness，the price went down ¼ cent．Then，since the reaction did not definitely tell me all I wished to know，I sold another quarter of a million bushels．I noticed that it was taken in driblets；that is，the buying was in lots of 10,000 or 15,000 bushels instead of being taken in two or three transactions which would have been the normal way．In addition to the homeopathic buying the price went down 1¼ cents on my selling．Now，I need not waste time pointing out that the way in which the market took my wheat and the disproportionate decline on my selling told me that there was no buying power there．Such being the case，what was the only thing to do？Of course，to sell a lot more．Following the dictates of experience may possibly fool you，now and then．But not following them invariably makes an ass of you．So I sold 2,000,000 bushels and the price went down some more．A few days later the market's behaviour practically compelled me to sell an additional 2,000,000 bushels and the price declined further still；a few days later wheat started to break badly and slumped off 6 cents a bushel．And it didn't stop there．It has been going down，with short-lived rallies．

Now，I didn't follow a hunch．Nobody gave me a tip．It was my habitual or professional mental attitude toward the commodities markets that gave me the profit and that attitude came from my years at this business．I study because my business is to trade．The moment the tape told me that I was on the right track my business duty was to increase my line．I did．That is all there is to it．

I have found that experience is apt to be steady dividend payer in this game and that observation gives you the best tips of all．The behaviour of a certain stock is all you need at times．You observe it．Then experience shows you how to profit by variations from the usual，that is，from the probable．For example，we know that all stocks do not move one way together but that all the stocks of a group will move up in a bull market and down in a bear market．This is a commonplace of speculation．It is the commonest of all self-given tips and the commission houses are well aware of it and pass it on to any customer who has not thought of it himself；I mean，the advice to trade in those stocks which have lagged behind other stocks of the same group．Thus，if U．S．Steel goes up，it is logically assumed that it is only a matter of time when Crucible or Republic or Bethlehem will follow suit．Trade conditions and prospects should work alike with all stocks of a group and the prosperity should be shared by all．On the theory，corroborated by experience times without number，that every dog has his day in the market，the public will buy A．B．Steel because it has not advanced while C．D．Steel and X．Y．Steel have gone up．

I never buy a stock even in a bull market，if it doesn't act as it ought to act in that kind of market．I have sometimes bought a stock during an undoubted bull market and found out that other stocks in the same group were not acting bullishly and I have sold out my stock．Why？Experience tells me that it is not wise to buck against what I may call the manifest group-tendency．I cannot expect to play certainties only．I must reckon on probabilities—and anticipate them．An old broker once said to me：“If I am walking along a railroad track and I see a train coming toward me at sixty miles an hour，do I keep on walking on the ties？Friend，I side-step．And I do not even pat myself on the back for being so wise and prudent．”

Last year，after the general bull movement was well under way，I noticed that one stock in a certain group was not going with the rest of the group，though the group with that one exception was going with the rest of the market．I was long a very fair amount of Blackwood Motors．Everybody knew that the company was doing a very big business．The price was rising from one to three points a day and the public was coming in more and more．This naturally centered attention on the group and all the various motor stocks began to go up．One of them，however，persistently held back and that was Chester．It lagged behind the others so that it was not long before it made people talk．The low price of Chester and its apathy was contrasted with the strength and activity in Blackwood and other motor stocks and the public logically enough listened to the touts and tipsters and wiseacres and began to buy Chester on the theory that it must presently move up with the rest of the group．

Instead of going up on this moderate public buying，Chester actually decline，Now，it would have been no job to put it up in that bull market，considering that Blackwood，a stock of the same group，was one of the sensational leaders of the general advance and we were hearing nothing but the wonderful improvement in the demand for automobiles of all kinds and the record output．

It was thus plain that the inside clique in Chester were not doing any of the things that inside cliques invariably do in a bull market．For this failure to do the usual thing there might be two reasons．Perhaps the insiders did not put it up because they wished to accumulate more stock before advancing the price．But this was an untenable theory if you analysed the volume and character of the trading in Chester．The other reason was that they did not put it up because they were afraid of getting stock if they tried to．

When the men who ought to want a stock don't want it，why should I want it？I figured that no matter how prosperous other automobile companies might be，it was a cinch to sell Chester short．Experiences had taught me to beware of buying a stock that refuses to follow the group-leader．

I easily established the fact that not only there was no inside buying but that there was actually inside selling．There were other symptomatic warnings against buying Chester，though all I required was its inconsistent market behaviour．It was again the tape that tipped me off and that was why I sold Chester short．One day，not very long afterward，the stock broke wide open．Later on we learned—officially，as it were—that insiders had indeed been selling it，knowing full well that the condition of the company was not good．The reason，as usual，was disclosed after the break．But the warning came before the break．I don't look out for the breaks；I look out for the warnings．I didn't know what was the trouble with Chester；neither did I follow a hunch．I merely knew that something must be wrong．

Only the other day we had what the newspapers called a sensational movement in Guiana Gold．After selling on the Curb at 50 or close to it，it was listed on the Stock Exchange．It started there at around 35，began to go down and finally broke 20．

Now，I'd never have called that break sensational because it was fully to be expected．If you had asked you could have learned the history of the company．No end of people knew it．It was told to me as follows：A syndicate was formed consisting of a half dozen extremely well-known capitalists and a prominent banking-house．One of the members was the head of the Belle Isle Exploration Company，which advanced Guiana over $10,000,000 cash and received in return bonds and 250,000 shares out of a total of one million shares of the Guiana Gold Mining Company．The stock went on a dividend basis and it was mighty well advertised．The Belle Isle people thought it well to cash in and they gave a call on their 250,000 shares to the bankers，who arranged to try to market that stock and some of their own holdings as well．They thought of entrusting the market manipulation to a professional whose fee was to be one third of the profits from the sale of the 250,000 shares above 36．I understand that the agreement was drawn up and ready to be signed but at the last moment the bankers decided to undertake the marketing themselves and save the fee．So they organized an inside pool．The bankers had a call on the Belle Isle holdings of 250,000 at 36．They put this in at 41．That is，insiders paid their own banking colleagues a 5-point profit to start with．I don't know whether they knew it or not．

It is perfectly plain that to the bankers the operation had every semblance of a cinch．We had run into a bull market and the stocks of the group to which Guiana Gold belonged were among the market leaders．The company was making big profits and paying regular dividends．This together with the high character of the sponsors made the public regard Guiana almost as an investment stock．I was told that about 400,000 shares were sold to the public all the way up to 47．

The gold group was very strong．But presently Guiana began to sag．It declined ten points．That was all right if the pool was marketing stock．But pretty soon the Street began to hear that things were not altogether satisfactory and the property was not bearing out the high expectations of the promoters．Then，of course，the reason for the decline became plain．But before the reason was known I had the warning and had taken steps to test the market for Guiana．The stock was acting pretty much as Chester Motors did．I sold Guiana．The price went down．I sold more．The price went still lower．The stock was repeating the performance of Chester and of a dozen other stocks whose clinical history I remembered．The tape plainly told me that there was something wrong—something that kept insiders from buying it—insiders who knew exactly why they should not buy their own stock in a bull market．On the other hand，outsiders，who did not know，were now buying because having sold at 45 and higher the stock looked cheap at 35 and lower．The dividend was still being paid．The stock was a bargain．

Then the news came．It reached me，as important market news often does，before it reached the public．But the confirmation of the reports of striking barren rock instead of rich ore merely gave me the reason for the earlier inside selling．I myself didn't sell on the news．I had sold long before，on the stock's behaviour．My concern with it was not philosophical．I am a trader and therefore looked for one sign：Inside buying．There wasn't any．I didn't have to know why the insiders did not think enough of their own stock to buy it on the decline．It was enough that their market plans plainly did not include further manipulation for the rise．That made it a cinch to sell the stock short．The public had bought almost a half million shares and the only change in ownership possible was from one set of ignorant outsiders who would sell in the hope of stopping losses to another set of ignorant outsiders who might buy in the hope of making money．

I am not telling you this to moralise on the public's losses through their buying of Guiana or on my profit through my selling of it，but to emphasise how important the study of group behaviourism is and how its lessons are disregarded by inadequately equipped traders，big and little．And it is not only in the stock market that the tape warns you．It blows the whistle quite as loudly in commodities．

I had an interesting experience in cotton．I was bearish on stocks and put out a moderate short line．At the same time I sold cotton short；50,000 bales．My stock deal proved profitable and I neglected my cotton．The first thing I knew I had a loss of $250,000 on my 50,000 bales．As I said，my stock deal was so interesting and I was doing so well in it that I did not wish to take my mind off it．Whenever I thought of cotton I just said to myself：“I'll wait for a reaction and cover．”The price would react a little but before I could decide to take my loss and cover the price would rally again，and go higher than ever．So I'd decide again to wait a little and I'd go back to my stock deal and confine my attention to that．Finally I closed out my stocks at a very handsome profit and went away to Hot Springs for a rest and a holiday．

That really was the first time that I had my mind free to deal with the problem of my losing deal in cotton．The trade had gone against me．There were times when it almost looked as if I might win out．I noticed that whenever anybody sold heavily there was a good reaction．But almost instantly the price would rally and make a new high for the move．

Finally，by the time I had been in Hot Springs a few days，I was a million to the bad and no let up in the rising tendency．I thought over all I had done and had not done and I said to myself：“I must be wrong！”With me to feel that I am wrong and to decide to get out are practically one process．So I covered，at a loss of about one million．

The next morning I was playing golf and not thinking of anything else．I had made my play in cotton．I had been wrong．I had paid for being wrong and the receipted bill was in my pocket．I had no more concern with the cotton market than I have at this moment．When I went back to the hotel for luncheon I stopped at the broker's office and took a look at the quotations．I saw that cotton had gone off 50 points．That wasn't anything．But I also noticed that it had not rallied as it had been in the habit of doing for weeks，as soon as the pressure of the particular selling that had depressed it eased up．This had indicated that the line of least resistance was upward and it had cost me a million to shut my eyes to it．

Now，however，the reason that had made me cover at a big loss was no longer a good reason since there had not been the usual prompt and vigorous rally．So I sold 10,000 bales and waited．Pretty soon the market went off 50 points．I waited a little while longer．There was no rally．I had got pretty hungry by now，so I went into the dining-room and ordered my luncheon．Before the waiter could serve it，I jumped up，went to the broker's office，I saw that there had been no rally and so I sold 10,000 bales more．I waited a little and had the pleasure of seeing the price decline 40 points more．That showed me I was trading correctly so I returned to the dining-room，ate my luncheon and went back to the broker's．There was no rally in cotton that day．That very night I left Hot Springs．

It was all very well to play golf but I had been wrong in cotton in selling when I did and in covering when I did．So I simply had to get back on the job and be where I could trade in comfort．The way the market took my first ten thousand bales made me sell the second ten thousand，and the way the market took the second made me certain the turn had come．It was the difference in behaviour．

Well，I reached Washington and went to my brokers' office there，which was in charge of my old friend Tucker．While I was there the market went down some more．I was more confident of being right now than I had been of being wrong before．So I sold 40,000 bales and the market went off 75 points．It showed that there was no support there．That night the market closed still lower．The old buying power was plainly gone．There was no telling at what level that power would again develop，but I felt confident of the wisdom of my position．The next morning I left Washington for New York by motor．There was no need to hurry．

When we got to Philadelphia I drove to a broker's office．I saw that there was the very dickens to pay in the cotton market．Prices had broken badly and there was a small-sized panic on．I didn't wait to get to New York．I called up my brokers on the long distance and I covered my shorts．As soon as I got my reports and found that I had practically made up my previous loss，I motored on to New York without having to stop en route to see any more quotations．

Some friends who were with me in Hot Springs talk to this day of the way I jumped up from the luncheon table to sell that second lot of 10,000 bales．But again that clearly was not a hunch．It was an impulse that came from the conviction that the time to sell cotton had now come，however great my previous mistake had been．I had to take advantage of it．It was my chance．The subconscious mind probably went on working，reaching conclusions for me．The decision to sell in Washington was the result of my observation．My years of experience in trading told me that the line of least resistance had changed from up to down．

I bore the cotton market no grudge for taking a million dollars out of me and I did not hate myself for making a mistake of that calibre any more than I felt proud for covering in Philadelphia and making up my loss．My trading mind concerns itself with trading problems and I think I am justified in asserting that I made up my first loss because I had the experience and the memory．





Chapter XVIII


HISTORY repeats itself all the time in Wall Street．Do you remember a story I told you about covering my shorts at the time Stratton had corn cornered？Well，another time I used practically the same tactics in the stock market．The stock was Tropical Trading．I have made money bulling it and also bearing it．It always was an active stock and a favourite with adventurous traders．The inside coterie has been accused time and again by the newspapers of being more concerned over the fluctuations in the stock than with encouraging permanent investment in it．The other day one of the ablest brokers I know asserted that not even Daniel Drew in Erie or H．O．Havemeyer in Sugar developed so perfect a method for milking the market for a stock as President Mulligan and his friends have done in Tropical Trading．Many times they have encouraged the bears to sell TT short and then have proceeded to squeeze them with business-like thoroughness．There was no more vindictiveness about the process than is felt by a hydraulic press—or no more squeamishness，either．

Of course，there have been people who have spoken about certain“unsavory incidents”in the market career of TT stock．But I dare say these critics were suffering from the squeezing．Why do the room traders，who have suffered so often from the loaded dice of the insiders，continue to go up against the game？Well，for one thing they like action and they certainly get it in Tropical Trading．No prolonged spells of dulness．No reasons asked or given．No time wasted．No patience strained by waiting for the tipped movement to begin．Always enough stock to go around—except when the short interest is big enough to make the scarcity worth while．One born every minute！

It so happened some time ago that I was in Florida on my usual winter vacation．I was fishing and enjoying myself with out any thought of the markets excepting when we received a batch of newspapers．One morning when the semi-weekly mail came in I looked at the stock quotations and saw that Tropical Trading was selling at 155．The last time I'd seen a quotation in it，I think，was around 140．My opinion was that we were going into a bear market and I was biding my time before going short of stocks．But there was no mad rush．That was why I was fishing and out of hearing of the ticker．I knew that I'd be back home when the real call came．In the meanwhile nothing that I did or failed to do would hurry matters a bit．

The behaviour of Tropical Trading was the outstanding feature of the market，according to the newspapers I got that morning．It served to crystallise my general bearishness because I thought it particularly asinine for the insiders to run up the price of TT in the face of the heaviness of the general list．There are times when the milking process must be suspended．What is abnormal is seldom a desirable factor in a trader's calculations and it looked to me as if the marking up of that stock were a capital blunder．Nobody can make blunders of that magnitude with impunity；not in the stock market．

After I got through reading the newspapers I went back to my fishing but I kept thinking of what the insiders in Tropical Trading were trying to do．That they were bound to fail was as certain as that a man is bound to smash himself if he jumps from the roof of a twenty-story building without a parachute．I couldn't think of anything else and finally I gave up trying to fish and sent off a telegram to my brokers to sell 2000 shares of TT at the market．After that I was able to go back to my fishing．I did pretty well．

That afternoon I received the reply to my telegram by special courier．My brothers reported that they had sold the 2000 shares of Tropical Trading at 153．So far so good．I was selling short on a declining market，which was as it should be．But I could not fish any more．I was too far away from a quotation board．I discovered this after I began to think of all the reasons why Tropical Trading should go down with the rest of the market instead of going up on inside manipulation．I therefore left my fishing camp and returned to Palm Beach；or，rather，to the direct wire to New York．

The moment I got to Palm Beach and saw what the misguided insiders were still trying to do，I let them have a second lot of 2000 TT．Back came the report and I sold another 2000 shares．The market behaved excellently．That is，it declined on my selling．Everything being satisfactory I went out and had a chair ride．But I wasn't happy．The more I thought the unhappier it made me to think that I hadn't sold more．So back I went to the broker's office and sold another 2000 shares．

I was happy only when I was selling that stock．Presently I was short 10,000 shares．Then I decided to return to New York．I had business to do now．My fishing I would do some other time．

When I arrived in New York I made it a point to get a line on the company's business，actual and prospective．What I learned strengthened my conviction that the insiders had been worse than reckless in jacking up the price at a time when such an advance was not justified either by the tone of the general market or by the company's earnings．

The rise，illogical and ill-timed though it was，had developed some public following and this doubtless encouraged the insiders to pursue their unwise tactics．Therefore I sold more stock．The insiders ceased their folly．So I tested the market again and again，in accordance with my trading methods，until finally I was short 30,000 shares of the stock of the Tropical Trading Company．By then the price was 133．

I had been warned that the TT insiders knew the exact whereabouts of every stock certificate in the Street and the precise dimensions and identity of the short interest as well as other facts of tactical importance．They were able men and shrewd traders．Altogether it was a dangerous combination to go up against．But facts are facts and the strongest of all allies are conditions．

Of course，on the way down from 153 to 133 the short interest had grown and the public that buys on reactions began to argue as usual：That stock had been considered a good purchase at 153 and higher．Now 20 points lower，it was necessarily a much better purchase．Same stock；same dividend rate；same officers；same business．Great bargain！

The public's purchases reduced the floating supply and the insiders，knowing that a lot of room traders were short，thought the time propitious for a squeezing．The price was duly run up to 150．I daresay there was plenty of covering but I stayed pat．Why shouldn't I ？The insiders might know that a short line of 30,000 shares had not been taken in but why should that frighten me？The reasons that had impelled me to begin selling at 153 and keep at it on the way down to 133，not only still existed but were stronger than ever．The insiders might desire to force me to cover but they adduced no convincing arguments．Fundamental conditions were fighting for me．It was not difficult to be both fearless and patient．A speculator must have faith in himself and in his judgment．The late Dickson G．Watts，ex-President of the New York Cotton Exchange and famous author of“Speculation as a Fine Art，”says that courage in a speculator is merely confidence to act on the decision of his mind．With me，I cannot fear to be wrong because I never think I am wrong until I am proven wrong．In fact，I am uncomfortable unless I am capitalising my experience．The course of the market at a given time does not necessarily prove me wrong．It is the character of the advance—or of the decline—that determines for me the correctness or the fallacy of my market position．I can only rise by knowledge．If I fall it must be by my own blunders．

There was nothing in the character of the rally from 133 to 150 to frighten me into covering and presently the stock，as was to be expected，started down again．It broke 140 before the inside clique began to give it support．Their buying was coincident with a flood of bull rumors about the stock．The company，we heard，was making perfectly fabulous profits，and the earnings justified an increase in the regular dividend rate．Also，the short interest was said to be perfectly huge and the squeeze of the century was about to be inflicted on the bear party in general and in particular on a certain operator who was more than over-extended．I couldn't begin to tell you all I heard as they ran the price up ten points．

The manipulation did not seem particularly dangerous to me but when the price touched 149 I decided that it was not wise to let the Street accept as true all the bull statements that were floating around．Of course，there was nothing that I or any other rank outsider could say that would carry conviction either to the frightened shorts or to those credulous customers of commission houses that trade on hearsay tips．The most effective retort courteous is that which the tape alone can print．People will believe that when they will not believe an affidavit from any living man，much less one from a chap who is short 30,000 shares．So I used the same tactics that I did at the time of the Stratton corner in corn，when I sold oats to make the traders bearish on corn．Experience and memory again．

When the insiders jacked up the price of Tropical Trading with a view to frightening the shorts I didn't try to check the rise by selling that stock．I was already short 30,000 shares of it which was as big a percentage of the floating supply as I thought wise to be short of．I did not propose to put my head into the noose so obligingly held open for me—the second rally was really an urgent invitation．What I did when TT touched 149 was to sell about 10,000 shares of Equatorial Commercial Corporation．This company owned a large block of Tropical Trading．

Equatorial Commercial，which was not as active a stock as TT，broke badly on my selling，as I had foreseen；and，of course，my purpose was achieved．When the traders—and the customers of the commission houses who had listened to the uncontradicted bull dope on TT—saw that the rise in Tropical synchronised with heavy selling and a sharp break in Equatorial，they naturally concluded that the strength of TT was merely a smoke-screen—a manipulated advance obviously designed to facilitate inside liquidation in Equatorial Commercial，which was largest holder of TT stock．It must be both long stock and inside stock in Equatorial，because no outsider would dream of selling so much short stock at the very moment when Tropical Trading was so very strong．So they sold Tropical Trading and checked the rise in that stock，the insiders very properly not wishing to take all the stock that was pressed for sale．The moment the insiders took away their support the price of TT declined．The traders and principal commission houses now sold some Equatorial also and I took in my short line in that at a small profit．I hadn't sold it to make money out of the operation but to check the rise in TT．

Time and again the Tropical Trading insiders and their hard-working publicity man flooded the Street with all manner of bull items and tried to put up the price．And every time they did I sold Equatorial Commercial short and covered it with TT reacted and carried E C with it．It took the wind out of the manipulators' sails．The price of TT finally went down to 125 and the short interest really grew so big that the insiders were enabled to run it up 20 or 25 points．This time it was a legitimate enough drive against an over-extended short interest；but while I foresaw the rally I did not cover，not wishing to lose my position．Before Equatorial Commercial could advance in sympathy with the rise in TT I sold a raft of it short—with the usual results．This gave the lie to the bull talk in TT which had got quite boisterous after the latest sensational rise．

By this time the general market had grown quite weak．As I told you，it was the conviction that we were in a bear market that started me selling TT short in the fishing-camp in Florida．I was short of quite a few other stocks but TT was my pet．Finally，general conditions proved too much for the inside clique to defy and TT hit the toboggan slide．It went below 120 for the first time in years；then below 110；below par；and still I did not cover．One day when the entire market was extremely weak Tropical Trading broke 90 and on the demoralization I covered．Same old reason！I had the opportunity—the big market and the weakness and the excess of sellers over buyers．I may tell you，even at the risk of appearing to be monotonously bragging of my cleverness，that I took in my 30,000 shares of TT at practically the lowest prices of the movement．But I wasn't thinking of covering at the bottom．I was intent on turning my paper profits into cash without losing much of the profit in the changing．

I stood pat throughout because I knew my position was sound．I wasn't bucking the trend of the market or going against basic conditions but the reverse，and that was what made me so sure of the failure of an over-confident inside clique．What they tried to do others had tried before and it had always failed．The frequent rallies，even when I knew as well as anybody that they were due，could not frighten me．I knew I'd do much better in the end by staying pat than by trying to cover to put out a new short line at a higher price．By sticking to the position that I felt was right I made over a million dollars．I was not indebted to hunches or to skilful tape reading or to stubborn courage．It was a dividend declared by my faith in my judgment and not by my cleverness or by my vanity．Knowledge is power and power need not fear lies—not even when the tape prints them．The retraction follows pretty quickly．

A year later，TT was jacked up again to 150 and hung around there for a couple of weeks．The entire market was entitled to a good reaction for it had risen uninterruptedly and it did not bull any longer．I know because I tested it．Now，the group to which TT belonged had been suffering from very poor business and I couldn't see anything to bull those stocks on anyhow，even if the rest of the market were due for a rise，which it wasn't．So I began to sell Tropical Trading．I intended to put out 10,000 shares in all．The price broke on my selling．I couldn't see that there was any support whatever．Then suddenly，the character of the buying changed．

I am not trying to make myself out a wizard when I assure you that I could tell the moment support came in．It instantly struck me that if the insiders in that stock，who never felt a moral obligation to keep the price up，were now buying the stock in the face of a declining general market there must be a reason．They were not ignorant asses nor philanthropists nor yet bankers concerned with keeping the price up to sell more securities over the counter．The price rose notwithstanding my selling and the selling of others．At 153 I covered my 10,000 shares and at 156 I actually went long because by that time the tape told me the line of least resistance was upward．I was bearish on the general market but I was confronted by a trading condition in a certain stock and not by a speculative theory in general．The price went out of sight，above 200．It was the sensation of the year．I was flattered by reports spoken and printed that I had been squeezed out of eight or nine millions of dollars．As a matter of fact，instead of being short I was long of TT all the way up．In fact，I held on a little too long and let some of my paper profits get away．Do you wish to know why I did？Because I thought the TT insiders would naturally do what I would have done had I been in their place．But that was something I had no business to think because my business is to trade—that is，to stick to the facts before me and not to what I think other people ought to do．





Chapter XIX


I DO not know when or by whom the word“manipulation”was first used in connection with what really are no more than common merchandising processes applied to the sale in bulk of securities on the Stock Exchange．Rigging the market to facilitate cheap purchases of a stock which it is desired to accumulate is also manipulation．But it is different．It may not be necessary to stoop to illegal practices，but it would be difficult to avoid doing what some would think illegitimate．How are you going to buy a big block of a stock in a bull market without putting up the price on yourself？That would be the problem．How can it be solved？It depends upon so many things that you can't give a general solution unless you say：possibly by means of very adroit manipulation．For instance？Well，it would depend upon conditions．You can't give any closer answer than that．

I am profoundly interested in all phases of my business，and of course I learn from the experience of others as well as from my own．But it is very difficult to learn how to manipulate stocks today from such yarns as are told of an afternoon in the brokers' offices after the close．Most of the tricks，devices and expedients of bygone days are obsolete and futile；or illegal and impracticable．Stock Exchange rules and conditions have changed，and the story—even the accurately detailed story—of what Daniel Drew or Jacob Little or Jay Gould could do fifty or seventy-five years ago is scarcely worth listening to．The manipulator today has no more need to consider what they did and how they did it than a cadet at West Point need study archery as practiced by the ancients in order to increase his working knowledge of ballistics．

On the other hand there is profit in studying the human factors—the ease with which human beings believe what it pleases them to believe；and how they allow themselves—indeed，urge themselves—to be influenced by their cupidity or by the dollar-cost of the average man's carelessness．Fear and hope remain the same；therefore the study of the psychology of speculators is as valuable as it ever was．Weapons change，but strategy remains strategy，on the New York Stock Exchange as on the battlefield．I think the clearest summing up of the whole thing was expressed by Thomas F．Woodlock when he declared：“The principles of successful stock speculation are based on the supposition that people will continue in the future to make the mistakes that they have made in the past．”

In booms，which is when the public is in the market in the greatest numbers，there is never any need of subtlety，so there is no sense of wasting time discussing either manipulation or speculation during such times；it would be like trying to find the difference in raindrops that are falling synchronously on the same roof across the street．The sucker has always tried to get something for nothing，and the appeal in all booms is always frankly to the gambling instinct aroused by cupidity and spurred by a pervasive prosperity．People who look for easy money invariably pay for the privilege of proving conclusively that it cannot be found on this sordid earth．At first，when I listened to the accounts of old-time deals and devices I used to think that people were more gullible in the 1860's and '70's than in the 1900's．But I was sure to read in the newspapers that very day or the next something about the latest Ponzi or the bust-up of some bucketing broker and about the millions of sucker money gone to join the silent majority of vanished savings．

When I first came to New York there was a great fuss made about wash sales and matched orders，for all that such practices were forbidden by the Stock Exchange．At times the washing was too crude to deceive anyone．The brokers had no hesitation in saying that“the laundry was active”whenever anybody tried to wash up some stock or other，and，as I have said before，more than once they had what were frankly referred to as“bucket-shop drives，”when a stock was offered down two or three points in a jiffy just to establish the decline on the tape and wipe up the myriad shoe-string traders who were long of the stock in the bucket shops．As for matched orders，they were always used with some misgivings by reason of the difficulty of coördinating and synchronising operations by brokers，all such business being against Stock Exchange rules．A few years ago a famous operator canceled the selling but not the buying part of his matched orders，and the result was that an innocent broker ran up the price twenty-five points or so in a few minutes，only to see it break with equal celerity as soon as his buying ceased．The original intention was to create an appearance of activity．Bad business，playing with such unreliable weapons．You see，you can't take your best brokers into your confidence—not if you want them to remain members of the New York Stock Exchange．Then also，the taxes have made all practices involving fictitious transactions much more expensive than they used to be in the old times．

The dictionary definition of manipulation includes corners．Now，a corner might be the result of manipulation or it might be the result of competitive buying，as，for instance，the Northern Pacific corner on May 9，1901，which certainly was not manipulation．The Stutz corner was expensive to everybody concerned，both in money and in prestige．And it was not a deliberately engineered corner，at that．

As a matter of fact very few of the great corners were profitable to the engineers of them．Both Commodore Vanderbilt's Harlem corners paid big，but the old chap deserved the millions he made out of a lot of short sports，crooked legislators and aldermen who tried to double-cross him．On the other hand，Jay Gould lost in his Northwestern corner．Deacon S．V．White made a million in his Lackawanna corner，but Jim Keene dropped a million in the Hannibal & St．Joe deal．The financial success of a corner of course depends upon the marketing of the accumulated holdings at higher than cost，and the short interest has to be of some magnitude for that to happen easily．

I used to wonder why corners were so popular among the big operators of a half-century ago．They were men of ability and experience，wide-awake and not prone to childlike trust in the philanthropy of their fellow traders．Yet they used to get stung with an astonishing frequency．A wise old broker told me that all the big operators of the '60's and‘70's had one ambition，and that was to work a corner．In many cases this was the offspring of vanity；in others，of the desire for revenge．At all events，to be pointed out as the man who had successfully cornered this or the other stock was in reality recognition of brains，boldness and boodle．It gave the cornerer the right to be haughty．He accepted the plaudits of his fellows as fully earned．It was more than the prospective money profit that prompted the engineers of corners to do their damnedest．It was the vanity complex asserting itself among cold-blooded operators．

Dog certainly ate dog in those days with relish and ease．I think I told you before that I have managed to escape being squeezed more than once，not because of the possession of a mysterious ticker-sense but because I can generally tell the moment the character of the buying in the stock makes it imprudent for me to be short of it．This I do by common-sense tests，which must have been tried in the old times also．Old Daniel Drew used to squeeze the boys with some frequency and make them pay high prices for the Erie“sheers”they had sold short to him．He was himself squeezed by Commodore Vanderbilt in Erie，and when old Drew begged for mercy the Commodore grimly quoted the Great Bear's own deathless distich：

He that sells what isn't hisn

Must buy it back or go to prim．

Wall Street remembers very little of an operator who for more than a generation was one of its Titans．His chief claim to immortality seems to be the phrase“watering stock．”

Addison G．Jerome was the acknowledged king of the Public Board in the spring of 1863．His market tips，they tell me，were considered as good as cash in bank．From all accounts he was a great trader and made millions．He was liberal to the point of extravagance and had a great following in the Street—until Henry Keep，known as William the Silent，squeezed him out of all his millions in the Old Southern corner．Keep，by the way，was the brother-in-law of Gov．Roswell P．Flower．

In most of the old corners the manipulation consisted chiefly of not letting the other man know that you were cornering the stock which he was variously invited to sell short．It therefore was aimed chiefly at fellow professionals，for the general public does not take kindly to the short side of the account．The reasons that prompted these wise professionals to put out short lines in such stocks were pretty much the same as prompts them to do the same thing today．Apart from the selling by faith-breaking politicians in the Harlem corner of the Commodore，I gather from the stories I have read that the professional traders sold the stock because it was too high．And the reason they thought it was too high was that it never before had sold so high；and that made it too high to buy；and if it was too high to buy it was just right to sell．That sounds pretty modern，doesn't it？They were thinking of the price，and the Commodore was thinking of the value！And so，for years afterwards，old-timers tell me that people used to say，“He went short of Harlem！”whenever they wished to describe abject poverty．

Many years ago I happened to be speaking to one of Jay Gould's old brokers．He assured me earnestly that Mr．Gould not only was a most unusual man—it was of him that old Daniel Drew shiveringly remarked，“His touch is Death ！”—but that he was head and shoulders above all other manipulators past and present．He must have been a financial wizard indeed to have done what he did；there can be no question of that．Even at this distance I can see that he had an amazing knack for adapting himself to new conditions，and that is valuable in a trader．He varied his methods of attack and defense without a pang because he was more concerned with the manipulation of properties than with stock speculation．He manipulated for investment rather than for a market turn．He early saw that the big money was in owning the railroads instead of rigging their securities on the floor of the Stock Exchange．He utilised the stock market of course．But I suspect it was because that was the quickest and easiest way to quick and easy money and he needed many millions，just as old Collis P．Huntington was always hard up because he always needed twenty or thirty millions more than the bankers were willing to lend him．Vision without money means heartaches；with money，it means achievement；and that means power；and that means money；and that means achievement；and so on，over and over and over．

Of course manipulation was not confined to the great figures of those days．There were scores of minor manipulators．I remember a story an old broker told me about the manners and morals of the early '60's．He said：

“The earliest recollection I have of Wall Street is of my first visit to the financial district．My father had some business to attend to there and for some reason or other took me with him．We came down Broadway and I remember turning off at Wall Street．We walked down Wall and just as we came to Broad or，rather，Nassau Street，to the corner where the Bankers' Trust Company's building now stands，I saw a crowd following two men．The first was walking eastward，trying to look unconcerned．He was followed by the other，a red-faced man who was wildly waving his hat with one hand and shaking the other fist in the air．He was yelling to beat the band：‘Shylock！Shylock！What's the price of money？Shylock！Shylock！’I could see heads sticking out of windows．They didn't have skyscrapers in those days，but I was sure the second and third-story rubbernecks would tumble out．My father asked what was the matter，and somebody answered something I didn't hear．I was too busy keeping a death clutch on my father's hand so that the jostling wouldn't separate us．The crowd was growing，as street crowds do，and I wasn't comfortable．Wild-eyed men came running down from Nassau Street and up from Broad as well as east and west on Wall Street．After we finally got out of the jam my father explained to me that the man who was shouting‘Shylock！’was So-and-So．I have forgotten the name，but he was the biggest operator in clique stocks in the city and was understood to have made—and lost—more money than any other man in Wall Street with the exception of Jacob Little．I remember Jacob Little's name because I thought it was a funny name for a man to have．The other man，the Shylock，was a notorious locker-up of money．His name has also gone from me．But I remember he was tall and thin and pale．In those days the cliques used to lock up money by borrowing it or，rather，by reducing the amount available to Stock Exchange borrowers．They would borrow it and get a certified check．They wouldn't actually take the money out and use it．Of course that was rigging．It was a form of manipulation，I think．”

I agree with the old chap．It was a phase of manipulation that we don't have nowadays．





Chapter XX


I MYSELF never spoke to any of the great stock manipulators that the Street still talks about．I don't mean leaders；I mean manipulators．They were all before my time，although when I first came to New York，James R．Keene，greatest of them all，was in his prime．But I was a mere youngster then，exclusively concerned with duplicating，in a reputable broker's office，the success I had enjoyed in the bucket shops of my native city．And，then，too，at the time Keene was busy with the U．S．Steel stocks—his manipulative masterpiece—I had no experience with manipulation，no real knowledge of it or of its value or meaning，and，for that matter，no great need of such knowledge．If I thought about it at all I suppose I must have regarded it as a well-dressed form of thimble-rigging，of which the lowbrow form was such tricks as had been tried on me in the bucket shops．Such talk as I since have heard on the subject has consisted in great part of surmises and suspicions；of guesses rather than intelligent analyses．

More than one man who knew him well has told me that Keene was the boldest and most brilliant operator that ever worked in Wall Street．That is saying a great deal，for there have been some great traders．Their names are now all but forgotten，but nevertheless they were kings in their day—for a day！They were pulled up out of obscurity into the sunlight of financial fame by the ticker tape—and the little paper ribbon didn't prove strong enough to keep them suspended there long enough for them to become historical fixtures．At all events Keene was by all odds the best manipulator of his day—and it was a long and exciting day．

He capitalized his knowledge of the game，his experience as an operator and his talents when he sold his services to the Havemeyer brothers，who wanted him to develop a market for the Sugar stocks．He was broke at the time or he would have continued to trade on his own hook；and he was some plunger！He was successful with Sugar；made the shares trading favourites，and that made them easily vendible．After that，he was asked time and again to take charge of pools．I am told that in these pool operations he never asked or accepted a fee，but paid for his share like the other members of the pool．The market conduct of the stock，of course，was exclusively in his charge．Often there was talk of treachery—on both sides．His feud with the Whitney-Ryan clique arose from such accusations．It is not difficult for a manipulator to be misunderstood by his associates．They don't see his needs as he himself does．I know this from my own experience．

It is a matter of regret that Keene did not leave an accurate record of his greatest exploit—the successful manipulation of the U．S．Steel shares in the spring of 1901．As I understand it，Keene never had an interview with J．P．Morgan about it．Morgan's firm dealt with or through Talbot J．Taylor & Co.，at whose office Keene made his headquarters．Talbot Taylor was Keene's son-in-law．I am assured that Keene's fee for his Work consisted of the pleasure he derived from the work．That he made millions trading in the market he helped to put up that spring is well known．He told a friend of mine that in the course of a few weeks he sold in the open market for the underwriters' syndicate more than seven hundred and fifty thousand shares．Not bad when you consider two things：That they were new and untried stocks of a corporation whose capitalization was greater than the entire debt of the United States at that time；and second，that men like D．G．Reid，W．B．Leeds，the Moore brothers，Henry Phipps，H．C．Frick and the other Steel magnates also sold hundreds of thousands of shares to the public at the same time in the same market that Keene helped to create．

Of course，general conditions favoured him．Not only actual business but sentiment and his unlimited financial backing made possible his success．What we had was not merely a big bull market but a boom and a state of mind not likely to be seen again．The undigested-securities panic came later，when Steel common，which Keene had marked up to 55 in 1901，sold at 10 in 1903 and at 8 in 1904．

We can't analyse Keene's manipulative campaigns．His books are not available；the adequately detailed record is nonexistent．For example，it would be interesting to see how he worked in Amalgamated Copper．H．H．Rogers and William Rockefeller had tried to dispose of their surplus stock in the market and had failed．Finally they asked Keene to market their line，and he agreed．Bear in mind that H．H．Rogers was one of the ablest business men of his day in Wall Street and that William Rockefeller was the boldest speculator of the entire Standard Oil coterie．They had practically unlimited resources and vast prestige as well as years of experience in the stock-market game．And yet they had to go to Keene．I mention this to show you that there are some tasks which it requires a specialist to perform．Here was a widely touted stock，sponsored by America's greatest capitalists，that could not be sold except at a great sacrifice of money and prestige．Rogers and Rockefeller were intelligent enough to decide that Keene alone might help them．

Keene began to work at once．He had a bull market to work in and sold two hundred and twenty thousand shares of Amalgamated at around par．After he disposed of the insiders' line the public kept on buying and the price went ten points higher．Indeed the insiders got bullish on the stock they had sold when they saw how eagerly the public was taking it．There was a story that Rogers actually advised Keene to go long of Amalgamated．It is scarcely credible that Rogers meant to unload on Keene．He was too shrewd a man not to know that Keene was no bleating lamb．Keene worked as he always did—that is，doing his big selling on the way down after the big rise．Of course his tactical moves were directed by his needs and by the minor currents that changed from day to day．In the stock market，as in warfare，it is well to keep in mind the difference between strategy and tactics．

One of Keene's confidential men—he is the best fly fisherman I know—told me only the other day that during the Amalgamated campaign Keene would find himself almost out of stock one day—that is，out of the stock he had been forced to take in marking up the price；and on the next day he would buy back thousands of shares．On the day after that，he would sell on balance．Then he would leave the market absolutely alone，to see how it would take care of itself and also to accustom it to do so．When it came to the actual marketing of the line he did what I told you：he sold it on the way down．The trading public is always looking for a rally，and，besides，there is the covering by the shorts．

The man who was closest to Keene during that deal told me that after Keene sold the Rogers-Rockefeller line for something like twenty or twenty-five million dollars in cash Rogers sent him a check for two hundred thousand．This reminds you of the millionaire's wife who gave the Metropolitan Opera House scrub-woman fifty cents reward for finding the one-hundred-thousand-dollar pearl necklace．Keene sent the check back with a polite note saying he was not a stock broker and that he was glad to have been of some service to them．They kept the check and wrote him that they would be glad to work with him again．Shortly after that it was that H．H．Rogers gave Keene the friendly tip to buy Amalgamated at around 130！

A brilliant operator，James R．Keene！His private secretary told me that when the market was going his way Mr．Keene was irascible；and those who knew him say his irascibility was expressed in sardonic phrases that lingered long in the memory of his hearers．But when he was losing he was in the best of humour，a polished man of the world，agreeable，epigrammatic，interesting．

He had in superlative degree the qualities of mind that are associated with successful speculators anywhere．That he did not argue with the tape is plain．He was utterly fearless but never reckless．He could and did turn in a twinkling，if he found he was wrong．

Since his day there have been so many changes in Stock Exchange rules and so much more rigorous enforcement of old rules，so many new taxes on stock sales and profits，and so on，that the game seems different．Devices that Keene could use with skill and profit can no longer be utilised．Also，we are assured，the business morality of Wall Street is on a higher plane．Nevertheless it is fair to say that in any period of our financial history Keene would have been a great manipulator because he was a great stock operator and knew the game of speculation from the ground up．He achieved what he did because conditions at the time permitted him to do so．He would have been as successful in his undertakings in 1922 as he was in 1901 or in 1876，when he first came to New York from California and made nine million dollars in two years．There are men whose gait is far quicker than the mob's．They are bound to lead—no matter how much the mob changes．

As a matter of fact，the change is by no means as radical as you'd imagine．The rewards are not so great，for it is no longer pioneer work and therefore it is not pioneer's pay．But in certain respects manipulation is easier than it was；in other ways much harder than in Keene's day．

There is no question that advertising is an art，and manipulation is the art of advertising through the medium of the tape．The tape should tell the story the manipulator wishes its readers to see．The truer the story the more convincing it is bound to be，and the more convincing it is the better the advertising is．A manipulator today，for instance，has not only to make a stock look strong but also to make it be strong．Manipulation therefore must be based on sound trading principles．That is what made Keene such a marvellous manipulator；he was a consummate trader to begin with．

The word“manipulation”has come to have an ugly sound．It needs an alias．I do not think there is anything so very mysterious or crooked about the process itself when it has for an object the selling of a stock in bulk，provided，of course，that such operations are not accompanied by misrepresentation．There is little question that a manipulator necessarily seeks his buyers among speculators．He turns to men who are looking for big returns on their capital and are therefore willing to run a greater than normal business risk．I can't have much sympathy for the man who，knowing this，nevertheless blames others for his own failure to make easy money．He is a devil of a clever fellow when he wins．But when he loses money the other fellow was a crook；a manipulator！In such moments and from such lips the word connotes the use of marked cards．But this is not so．

Usually the object of manipulation is to develop marketability—that is，the ability to dispose of fair-sized blocks at some price at any time．Of course a pool，by reason of a reversal of general market conditions，may find itself unable to sell except at a sacrifice too great to be pleasing．They then may decide to employ a professional，believing that his skill and experience will enable him to conduct an orderly retreat instead of suffering an appalling rout．

You will notice that I do not speak of manipulation designed to permit considerable accumulation of a stock as cheaply as possible，as，for instance，in buying for control，because this does not happen often nowadays．

When Jay Gould wished to cinch his control of Western Union and decided to buy a big block of the stock，Washington E．Connor，who had not been seen on the floor of the Stock Exchange for years，suddenly showed up in person at the Western Union post．He began to bid for Western Union．The traders to a man laughed—at his stupidity in thinking them so simple—and they cheerfully sold him all the stock he wanted to buy．It was too raw a trick，to think he could put up the price by acting as though Mr．Gould wanted to buy Western Union．Was that manipulation？I think I can only answer that by saying“No；and yes！”

In the majority of cases the object of manipulation is，as I said，to sell stock to the public at the best possible price．It is not alone a question of selling but of distributing．It is obviously better in every way for a stock to be held by a thousand people than by one man—better for the market in it．So it is not alone the sale at a good price but the character of the distribution that a manipulator must consider．

There is no sense in marking up the price to a very high level if you cannot induce the public to take it off your hands later．Whenever inexperienced manipulators try to unload at the top and fail，old-timers look mighty wise and tell you that you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make him drink．Original devils！As a matter of fact，it is well to remember a rule of manipulation，a rule that Keene and his able predecessors well knew．It is this：Stocks are manipulated to the highest point possible and then sold to the public on the way down．

Let me begin at the beginning．Assume that there is some one—an underwriting syndicate or a pool or an individual—that has a block of stock which it is desired to sell at the best price possible．It is a stock duly listed on the New York Stock Exchange．The best place for selling it ought to be the open market，and the best buyer ought to be the general public．The negotiations for the sale are in charge of a man．He—or some present or former associate—has tried to sell the stock on the Stock Exchange and has not succeeded．He is—or soon becomes—sufficiently familiar with stock-market operations to realize that more experience and greater aptitude for the work are needed than he possesses．He knows personally or by hearsay several men who have been successful in their handling of similar deals，and he decides to avail himself of their professional skill．He seeks one of them as he would seek a physician if he were ill or an engineer if he needed that kind of expert．

Suppose he has heard of me as a man who knows the game．Well，I take it that he tries to find out all he can about me．He then arranges for an interview，and in due time calls at my office．

Of course，the chances are that I know about the stock and what it represents．It is my business to know．That is how I make my living．My visitor tells me what he and his associates wish to do，and asks me to undertake the deal．

It is then my turn to talk．I ask for whatever information I deem necessary to give me a clear understanding of what I am asked to undertake．I determine the value and estimate the market possibilities of that stock．That and my reading of current conditions in turn help me to gauge the likelihood of success for the proposed operation．

If my information inclines me to a favourable view I accept the proposition and tell him then and there what my terms will be for my services．If he in turn accepts my terms—the honorarium and the conditions—I begin my work at once．

I generally ask and receive calls on a block of stock．I insist upon graduated calls as the fairest to all concerned．The price of the call begins at a little below the prevailing market price and goes up；say，for example，that I get calls on one hundred thousand shares and the stock is quoted at 40．I begin with a call for some thousands of shares at 35，another at 37，another at 40，and at 45 and 50，and so on up to 75 or 80．

If as the result of my professional work—my manipulation—the price goes up，and if at the highest level there is a good demand for the stock so that I can sell fair-sized blocks of it I of course call the stock．I am making money；but so are my clients making money．This is as it should be．If my skill is what they are paying for they ought to get value．Of course，there are times when a pool may be wound up at a loss，but that is seldom，for I do not undertake the work unless I see my way clear to a profit．This year I was not so fortunate in one or two deals，and I did not make a profit．There are reasons，but that is another story，to be told later—perhaps．

The first step in a bull movement in a stock is to advertise the fact that there is a bull movement on．Sounds silly，doesn't it？Well，think a moment．It isn't as silly as it sounded，is it？The most effective way to advertise what，in effect，are your honourable intentions is to make the stock active and strong．After all is said and done，the greatest publicity agent in the wide world is the ticker，and by far the best advertising medium is the tape．I do not need to put out any literature for my clients．I do not have to inform the daily press as to the value of the stock or to work the financial reviews for notices about the company's prospects．Neither do I have to get a following．I accomplish all these highly desirable things by merely making the stock active．When there is activity there is a synchronous demand for explanations；and that means，of course，that the necessary reasons—for publication—supply themselves without the slightest aid from me．

Activity is all that the floor traders ask．They will buy or sell any stock at any level if only there is a free market for it．They will deal in thousands of shares wherever they see activity，and their aggregate capacity is considerable．It necessarily happen that they constitute the manipulator's first crop of buyers．They will follow you all the way up and they thus are a great help at all the stages of the operation．I understand that James R．Keene used habitually to employ the most active of the room traders，both to conceal the source of the manipulation and also because he knew that they were by far the best business-spreaders and tip-distributors．He often gave calls to them—verbal calls—above the market，so that they might do some helpful work before they could cash in．He made them earn their profit．To get a professional following I myself have never had to do more than to make a stock active．Traders don't ask for more．It is well，of course，to remember that these professionals on the floor of the Exchange buy stocks with the intention of selling them at a profit．They do not insist on its being a big profit；but it must be a quick profit．

I make the stock active in order to draw the attention of speculators to it，for the reasons I have given．I buy it and I sell it and the traders follow suit．The selling pressure is not apt to be strong where a man has as much speculatively held stock sewed up—in calls—as I insist on having．The buying，therefore，prevails over the selling，and the public follows the lead not so much of the manipulator as of the room traders．It comes in as a buyer．This highly desirable demand I fill—that is，I sell stock on balance．If the demand is what it ought to be it will absorb more than the amount of stock I was compelled to accumulate in the earlier stages of the manipulation；and when this happens I sell the stock short—that is，technically．In other words，I sell more stock than I actually hold．It is perfectly safe for me to do so since I am really selling against my calls．Of course，when the demand from the public slackens，the stock ceases to advance．Then I wait．

Say，then，that the stock has ceased to advance．There comes a weak day．The entire market may develop a reactionary tendency or some sharp-eyed trader my perceive that there are no buying orders to speak of in my stock，and he sells it，and his fellows follow．Whatever the reason may be，my stock starts to go down．Well，I begin to buy it．I give it the support that a stock ought to have if it is in good odour with its own sponsors．And more：I am able to support it without accumulating it—that is，without increasing the amount I shall have to sell later on．Observe that I do this without decreasing my financial resources．Of course what I am really doing is covering stock I sold short at higher prices when the demand from the public or from the traders or from both enabled me to do it．It is always well to make it plain to the traders—and to the public，also—that there is a demand for the stock on the way down．That tends to check both reckless short selling by the professionals and liquidation by frightened holders—which is the selling you usually see when a stock gets weaker and weaker，which in turn is what a stock does when it is not supported．These covering purchases of mine constitute what I call the stabilising process．

As the market broadens I of course sell stock on the way up，but never enough to check the rise．This is in strict accordance with my stabilising plans．It is obvious that the more stock I sell on a reasonable and orderly advance the more I encourage the conservative speculators，who are more numerous than the reckless room traders；and in addition the more support I shall be able to give to the stock on the inevitable weak days．By always being short I always am in a position to support the stock without danger to myself．As a rule I begin my selling at a price that will show me a profit．But I often sell without having a profit，simply to create or to increase what I may call my riskless buying power．My business is not alone to put up the price or to sell a big block of stock for a client but to make money for myself．That is why I do not ask any clients to finance my operations．My fee is contingent upon my success．

Of course what I have described is not my invariable practice．I neither have nor adhere to an inflexible system．I modify my terms and conditions according to circumstances．

A stock which it is desired to distribute should be manipulated to the highest possible point and then sold．I repeat this both because it is fundamental and because the public apparently believes that the selling is all done at the top．Sometimes a stock gets waterlogged，as it were；it doesn't go up．That is the time to sell．The price naturally will go down on your selling rather further than you wish，but you can generally nurse it back．As long as a stock that I am manipulating goes up on my buying I know I am all hunky，and if need be I buy it with confidence and use my own money without fear—precisely as I would any other stock that acts the same way．It is the line of least resistance．You remember my trading theories about that line，don't you？Well，when the price line of least resistance is established I follow it，not because I am manipulating that particular stock at that particular moment but because I am a stock operator at all times．

When my buying does not put the stock up I stop buying and then proceed to sell it down；and that also is exactly what I would do with that same stock if I did not happen to be manipulating it．The principal marketing of the stock，as you know，is done on the way down．It is perfectly astonishing how much stock a man can get rid of on a decline．

I repeat that at no time during the manipulation do I forget to be a stock trader．My problems as a manipulator，after all，are the same that confront me as an operator．All manipulation comes to an end when the manipulator cannot make a stock do what he wants it to do．When the stock you are manipulating doesn't act as it should，quit．Don't argue with the tape．Do not seek to lure the profit back．Quit while the quitting is good—and cheap．





Chapter XXI


I AM well aware that all these generalities do not sound especially impressive．Generalities seldom do．Possibly I may succeed better if I give a concrete example．I'll tell you how I marked up the price of a stock 30 points，and in so doing accumulated only seven thousand shares and developed a market that would absorb almost any amount of stock．

It was Imperial Steel．The stock had been brought out by reputable people and it had been fairly well tipped as a property of value．About 30 per cent of the capital stock was placed with the general public through various Wall Street houses，but there had been no significant activity in the shares after they were listed．From time to time somebody would ask about it and one or another insider—members of the original underwriting syndicate—would say that the company's earnings were better than expected and the prospects more than encouraging．This was true enough and very good as far as it went，but not exactly thrilling．The speculative appeal was absent，and from the investor's point of view the price stability and dividend permanency of the stock were not yet demonstrated．It was a stock that never behaved sensationally．It was so gentlemanly that no corroborative rise ever followed the insiders' eminently truthful reports．On the other hand，neither did the price decline．

Imperial Steel remained unhonoured and unsung and untipped，content to be one of those stocks that don't go down because nobody sells and that nobody sells because nobody likes to go short of a stock that is not well distributed；the seller is too much at the mercy of the loaded-up inside clique．Similarly，there is no inducement to buy such a stock．To the investor Imperial Steel therefore remained a speculation．To the speculator it was a dead one—the kind that makes an investor of you against your will by the simple expedient of falling into a trance the moment you go long of it．The chap who is compelled to lug a corpse a year or two always loses more than the original cost of the deceased；he is sure to find himself tied up with it when some really good things come his way．

One day the foremost member of the Imperial Steel syndicate，acting for himself and associates，came to see me．They wished to create a market for the stock，of which they controlled the undistributed 70 per cent．They wanted me to dispose of their holdings at better prices than they thought they would obtain if they tried to sell in the open market．They wanted to know on what terms I would undertake the job．

I told him that I would let him know in a few days．Then I looked into the property．I had experts go over the various departments of the company—industrial，commercial and financial．They made reports to me which were unbiased．I wasn't looking for the good or the bad points，but for the facts，such，as they were．

The reports showed that it was a valuable property．The prospects justified purchases of the stock at the prevailing market price—if the investor were willing to wait a little．Under the circumstances an advance in the price would in reality be the commonest and most legitimate of all market movements—to wit，the process of discounting the future．There was therefore no reason that I could see why I should not conscientiously and confidently undertake the bull manipulation of Imperial Steel．

I let my man know my mind and he called at my office to talk the deal over in detail．I told him what my terms were．For my services I asked no cash，but calls on one hundred thousand shares of the Imperial Steel stock．The price of the calls ran up from 70 to 100．That may seem like a big fee to some．But they should consider that the insiders were certain they themselves could not sell one hundred thousand shares，or even fifty thousand shares，at 70．There was no market for the stock．All the talk about wonderful earnings and excellent prospects had not brought in buyers，not to any great extent．In addition，I could not get my fee in cash without my clients first making some millions of dollars．What I stood to make was not an exorbitant selling commission．It was a fair contingent fee．

Knowing that the stock had real value and that general market conditions were bullish and therefore favourable for an advance in all good stocks，I figured that I ought to do pretty well．My clients were encouraged by the opinions I expressed，agreed to my terms at once，and the deal began with pleasant feelings all around．

I proceeded to protect myself as thoroughly as I could．The syndicate owned or controlled about 70 per cent of the out standing stock．I had them deposit their 70 per cent under a trust agreement．I didn't propose to be used as a dumping ground for the big holders．With the majority holdings thus securely tied up，I still had 30 per cent of scattered holdings to consider，but that was a risk I had to take．Experienced speculators do not expect ever to engage in utterly riskless ventures．As a matter of fact，it was not much more likely that all the untrusteed stock would be thrown on the market at one fell swoop than that all the policyholders of a life-insurance company would die at the same hour，the same day．There are unprinted actuarial tables of stock-market risks as well as of human mortality．

Having protected myself from some of the avoidable dangers of a stock-market deal of that sort，I was ready to begin my campaign．Its objective was to make my calls valuable．To do this I must put up the price and develop a market in which I could sell one hundred thousand shares—the stock in which I held options．

The first thing I did was to find out how much stock was likely to come on the market on an advance．This was easily done through my brokers，who had no trouble in ascertaining what stock was for sale at or a little above the market．I don't know whether the specialists told them what orders they had on their books or not．The price was nominally 70，but I could not have sold one thousand shares at that price．I had no evidence of even a moderate demand at that figure or even a few points lower．I had to go by what my brokers found out．But it was enough to show me how much stock there was for sale and how little was wanted．

As soon as I had a line on these points I quietly took all the stock that was for sale at 7o and higher．When I say“I”you will understand that I mean my brokers．The sales were for account of some of the minority holders because my clients naturally had cancelled whatever selling orders they might have given out before they tied up their stock．

I didn't have to buy very much stock．Moreover，I knew that the right kind of advance would bring in other buying a orders—and，of course，selling orders also．

I didn't give bull tips on Impdrial Steel to anybody．I didn't have to．My job was to seek directly to influence sentiment by the best possible kind of publicity．I do not say that there should never be bull propaganda．It is as legitimate and indeed as desirable to advertise the value of a new stock as to advertise the value of woolens or shoes or automobiles．Accurate and reliable information should be given by the public．But what I meant was that the tape did all that was needed for my purpose．As I said before，the reputable newspapers always try to print explanations for market movements．It is news．Their readers demand to know not only what happens in the stock market but why it happens．Therefore without the manipulator lifting a finger the financial writers will print all the available information and gossip，and also analyse the reports of earnings，trade condition and outlook；in short，whatever may throw light on the advance．Whenever a news paperman or an acquaintance asks my opinion of a stock and I have one I do not hesitate to express it．I do not volunteer advice and I never give tips，but I have nothing to gain in my operations from secrecy．At the same time I realise that the best of all tipsters，the most persuasive of all salesmen，is the tape．

When I had absorbed all the stock that was for sale at 70 and a little higher I relieved the market of that pressure，and naturally that made clear for trading purposes the line of least resistance in Imperial Steel．It was manifestly upward．The moment that fact was perceived by the observant traders on the floor they logically assumed that the stock was in for an advance the extent of which they could not know；but they knew enough to begin buying．Their demand for Imperial Steel，created exclusively by the obviousness of the stock's rising tendency—the tape's infallible bull tip！—I promptly filled．I sold to the traders the stock that I had bought from the tired-out holders at the beginning．Of course this selling was judiciously done；I contented myself with supplying the demand．I was not forcing my stock on the market and I did not want too rapid an advance．It wouldn't have been good business to sell out the half of my one hundred thousand shares at that stage of the proceedings．My job was to make a market on which I might sell my entire line．

But even though I sold only as much as the traders were anxious to buy，the market was temporarily deprived of my own buying power，which I had hitherto exerted steadily．In due course the traders' purchases ceased and the price stopped rising．As soon as that happened there began the selling by disappointed bulls or by those traders whose reasons for buying disappeared the instant the rising tendency was checked．But I was ready for this selling，and on the way down I bought back the stock I had sold to the traders a couple of points higher．This buying of stock I knew was bound to be sold in turn checked the downward course；and when the price stopped going down the selling orders stopped coming in．

I then began all over again．I took all the stock that was for sale on the way up—it wasn't very much—and the price began to rise a second time；from a higher starting point than 70．Don't forget that on the way down there are many holders who wish to heaven they had sold theirs but won't do it three or four points from the top．Such speculators always vow they will surely sell out if there is a rally．They put in their orders to sell on the way up，and then they change their minds with the change in the stock's price-trend．Of course there is always profit taking from safe-playing quick runners to whom a profit is always a profit to be taken．

All I had to do after that was to repeat the process；alternately buying and selling；but always working higher．

Sometimes，after you have taken all the stock that is for sale，it pays to rush up the price sharply，to have what might be called little bull flurries in the stock you are manipulating．It is excellent advertising，because it makes talk and also brings in both the professional traders and that portion of the speculating public that likes action．It is，I think，a large portion．I did that in Imperial Steel，and whatever demand was created by those spurts I supplied．My selling always kept the upward movement within bounds both as to extent and as to speed．In buying on the way down and selling on the way up I was doing more than marking up the price：I was developing the marketability of Imperial Steel．

After I began my operations in it there never was a time when a man could not buy or sell the stock freely；I mean by this，buy or sell a reasonable amount without causing over-violent fluctuations in the price．The fear of being left high and dry if he bought，or squeezed to death if he sold，was gone．The gradual spread among the professionals and the public of a belief in the permanence of the market for Imperial Steel had much to do with creating confidence in the movement；and，of course，the activity also put an end to a lot of other objections．The result was that after buying and selling a good many thousands of shares I succeeded in making the stocks sell at par．At one hundred dollars a share everybody wanted to buy Imperial Steel．Why not？Everybody now knew that it was a good stock；that it had been and still was a bargain．The proof was the rise．A stock that could go thirty points from 70 could go up thirty more from par．That is the way a good many argued．

In the course of marking up the price those thirty points I accumulated only seven thousand shares．The price on this line averaged me almost exactly 85．That meant a profit of fifteen points on it；but，of course，my entire profit，still on paper，was much more．It was a safe enough profit，for I had a market for all I wanted to sell．The stock would sell higher on judicious manipulation and I had graduated calls on one hundred thousand shares beginning at 70 and ending at 100．

Circumstances prevented me from carrying out certain plans of mine for converting my paper-profits into good hard cash．It had been，if I do say so myself，a beautiful piece of manipulation，strictly legitimate and deservedly successful．The property of the company was valuable and the stock was not dear at the higher price．One of the members of the original syndicate developed a desire to secure the control of the property—a prominent banking house with ample resources．The control of a prosperous and growing concern like the Imperial Steel Corporation is possibly more valuable to a banking firm than to individual investors．At all events，this firm made me an offer for all my options on the stock．It meant an enormous profit for me，and I instantly took it．I am always willing to sell out when I can do so in a lump at a good profit．I was quite content with what I made out of it．

Before I disposed of my calls on the hundred thousand shares I learned that these bankers had employed more experts to make a still more thorough examination of the property．Their reports showed enough to bring me in the offer I got．I kept several thousand shares of the stock for investment．I believe in it．

There wasn't anything about my manipulation of Imperial Steel that wasn't normal and sound．As long as the price went up on my buying I knew I was O．K．The stock never got waterlogged，as a stock sometimes does．When you find that it fails to respond adequately to your buying you don't need any better tip to sell．You know that if there is any value to a stock and general market conditions are right you can always nurse it back after a decline，no matter if it's twenty points．But I never had to do anything like that in Imperial Steel．

In my manipulation of stocks I never lose sight of basic trading principles．Perhaps you wonder why I repeat this or why I keep on harping on the fact that I never argue with the tape or lose my temper at the market because of its behaviour．You would think—wouldn't you？—that shrewd men who have made millions in their own business and in addition have successfully operated in Wall Street at times would realise the wisdom of playing the game dispassionately．Well，you would be surprised at the frequency with which some of our most successful promoters behave like peevish women because the market does not act the way they wish it to act．They seem to take it as a personal slight，and they proceed to lose money by first losing their temper．

There has been much gossip about a disagreement between John Prentiss and myself．People have been led to expect a dramatic narrative of a stock-market deal that went wrong or some double-crossing that cost me—or him—millions；or something of that sort．Well，it wasn't．

Prentiss and I had been friendly for years．He had given me at various times information that I was able to utilize profitably，and I had given him advice which he may or may not have followed．If he did he saved money．

He was largely instrumental in the organisation and promotion of the Petroleum Products Company．After a more or less successful market début general conditions changed for the worse and the new stock did not fare as well as Prentiss and his associates had hoped．When basic conditions took a turn for the better Prentiss formed a pool and began operations in Pete Products．

I cannot tell you anything about his technique．He didn't tell me how he worked and I didn't ask him．But it was plain that notwithstanding his Wall Street experience and his undoubted cleverness，whatever it was he did proved of little value and it didn't take the pool long to find out that they couldn't get rid of much stock．He must have tried everything he knew，because a pool manager does not ask to be superseded by an outsider unless he feels unequal to the task，and that is the last thing the average man likes to admit．At all events he came to me and after some friendly preliminaries he said he wanted me to take charge of the market for Pete Products and dispose of the pool's holdings，which amounted to a little over one hundred thousand shares．The stock was selling at 102 to 103．

The thing looked dubious to me and I declined his proposition with thanks．But he insisted that I accept．He put it on personal grounds，so that in the end I consented．I constitutionally dislike to identify myself with enterprises in the success of which I cannot feel confidence，but I also think a man owes something to his friends and acquaintances．I said I would do my best，but I told him I did not feel very cocky about it and I enumerated the adverse factors that I would have to contend with．But all Prentiss said to that was that he wasn't asking me to guarantee millions in profits to the pool．He was sure that if I took hold I'd make out well enough to satisfy any reasonable being．

Well，there I was，engaged in doing something against my own judgment．I found，as I feared，a pretty tough state of affairs，due in great measure to Prentiss' own mistakes while he was manipulating the stock for account of the pool．But the chief factor against me was time．I was convinced that we were rapidly approaching the end of a bull swing and therefore that the improvement in the market，which had so encouraged Prentiss，would prove to be merely a short-lived rally．I feared that the market would turn definitely bearish before I could accomplish much with Pete Products．However，I had given my promise and I decided to work as hard as I knew how．

I started to put up the price．I had moderate success．I think I ran it up to 107 or thereabouts，which was pretty fair，and I was even able to sell a little stock on balance．It wasn't much，but I was glad not to have increased the pool's holdings．There were a lot of people not in the pool who were just waiting for a small rise to dump their stock，and I was a godsend to them．Had general conditions been better I also would have done better．It was too bad that I wasn't called in earlier．All I could do now，I felt，was to get out with as little loss as possible to the pool．

I sent for Prentiss and told him my views．But he started to object．I then explained to him why I took the position I did．I said：“Prentiss，I can feel very plainly the pulse of the market．There is no follow-up in your stock．It is no trick to see just what the public's reaction is to my manipulation．Listen：When Pete Products is made as attractive to traders as possible and you give it all the support needed at all times and notwithstanding all that you find that the public leaves it alone you may be sure that there is something wrong，not with the stock but with the market．There is absolutely no use in trying to force matters．You are bound to lose if you do．A pool manager should be willing to buy his own stock when he has company．But when he is the only buyer in the market he'd be an ass to buy it．For every five thousand shares I buy the public ought to be willing or able to buy five thousand more．But I certainly am not going to do all the buying．If I did，all I would succeed in doing would be to get soaked with a lot of long stock that I don't want．There is only one thing to do，and that is to sell．And the only way to sell is to sell．”

“You mean，sell for what you can get？”asked Prentiss．

“Right！”I said．I could see he was getting ready to object．“If I am to sell the pool's stock at all you can make up your mind that the price is going to break through par and—”

“Oh，no！Never ！”he yelled．You'd have imagined I was asking him to join a suicide club．

“Prentiss，”I said to him，“it is a cardinal principle of stock manipulation to put up a stock in order to sell it．But you don't sell in bulk on the advance．You can't．The big selling is done on the way down from the top．I cannot put up your stock to 125 or 130．I'd like to，but it can't be done．So you will have to begin your selling from this level．In my opinion all stocks are going down，and Petroleum Products isn't going to be the one exception．It is better for it to go down now on the pool's selling than for it to break next month on selling by some one else．It will go down anyhow．”

I can't see that I said anything harrowing，but you could have heard his howls in China．He simply wouldn't listen to such a thing．It would never do．It would play the dickens with the stock's record，to say nothing of inconvenient possibilities at the banks where the stock was held as collateral on loans，and so on．

I told him again that in my judgment nothing in the world could prevent Pete Products from breaking fifteen or twenty points，because the entire market was headed that way，and I once more said it was absurd to expect his stock to be a dazzling exception．But again my talk went for nothing．He insisted that I support the stock．

Here was a shrewd business man，one of the most successful promoters of the day，who had made millions in Wall Street deals and knew much more than the average man about the game of speculation，actually insisting on supporting a stock in an incipient bear market．It was his stock，to be sure，but it was nevertheless bad business．So much so that it went against the grain and I again began to argue with him．But it was no use．He insisted on putting in supporting orders．

Of course when the general market got weak and the decline began in earnest Pete Products went with the rest．Instead of selling I actually bought stock for the insiders' pool—by Prentiss' orders．

The only explanation is that Prentiss did not believe the bear market was right on top of us．I myself was confident that the bull market was over．I had verified my first surmise by tests not alone in Pete Products but in other stocks as well．I didn't wait for the bear market to announce its safe arrival before I started selling．Of course I didn't sell a share of Pete Products，though I was short of other stocks．

The Pete Products pool，as I expected，was hung up with all they held to begin with and with all they had to take in their futile effort to hold up the price．In the end they did liquidate；but at much lower figures than they would have got if Prentiss had let me sell when and as I wished．It could not be otherwise．But Prentiss still thinks he was right—or says he does．I understand he says the reason I gave him the advice I did was that I was short of other stocks and the general market was going up．It implies，of course，that the break in Pete Products that would have resulted from selling out the pool's holdings at any price would have helped my bear position in other stocks．

That is all tommyrot．I was not bearish because I was short of stocks．I was bearish because that was the way I sized up the situation，and I sold stocks short only after I turned bearish．There never is much money in doing things wrong end to；not in the stock market．My plan for selling the pool's stock was based on what the experience of twenty years told me alone was feasible and therefore wise．Prentiss ought to have been enough of a trader to see it as plainly as I did．It was too late to try to do anything else．

I suppose Prentiss shares the delusion of thousands of outsiders who think a manipulator can do anything．He can't．The biggest thing Keene did was his manipulation of U．S．Steel common and preferred in the spring of 1901．He succeeded not because he was clever and resourceful and not because he had a syndicate of the richest men in the country back of him．He succeeded partly because of those reasons but chiefly because the general market was right and the public's state of mind was right．

It isn't good business for a man to act against the teachings of experience and against common sense．But the suckers in Walt Street are not all outsiders．Prentiss' grievance against me is what I have just told you．He feels sore because I did my manipulation not as I wanted to but as he asked me to．




There isn't anything mysterious or underhanded or crooked about manipulation designed to sell a stock in bulk provided such operations are not accompanied by deliberate misrepresentations．Sound manipulation must be based on sound trading principles．People lay great stress on old-time practices，such as wash sales．But I can assure you that the mere mechanics of deception count for very little．The difference between stock-market manipulation and the over-the-counter sale of stocks and bonds is in the character of the clientele rather than in the character of the appeal．J．P．Morgan & Co．sell an issue of bonds to the public—that is，to investors．A manipulator disposes of a block of stock to the public—that is，to speculators．An investor looks for safety，for permanence of the interest return on the capital he invests．The speculator looks for a quick profit．

The manipulator necessarily finds his primary marker among speculators—who are willing to run a greater than normal business risk so long as they have a reasonable chance to get a big return on their capital．I myself never have believed in blind gambling．I may plunge or I may buy one hundred shares．But in either case I must have a reason for what I do．

I distinctly remember how I got into the game of manipulation—that is，in the marketing of stocks for others．It gives me pleasure to recall it because it shows so beautifully the professional Wall Street attitude toward stock-market operations．It happened after I had“come back”— that is，after my Bethlehem Steel trade in 1915 started me on the road to financial recovery．

I traded pretty steadily and had very good luck．I have never sought newspaper publicity，but neither have I gone out of my way to hide myself．At the same time，you know that professional Wall Street exaggerates both the successes and the failures of whichever operator happens to be active；and，of course，the newspapers hear about him and print rumors．I have been broke so many times，according to the gossips，or have made so many millions，according to the same authorities，that my only reaction to such reports is to wonder how and where they are born．And how they grow！I have had broker friend after broker friend bring the same story to me，a little changed each time，improved，more circumstantial．

All this preface is to tell you how I first came to undertake the manipulation of a stock for someone else．The stories the newspapers printed of how I had paid back in full the millions I owed did the trick．My plungings and my winnings were so magnified by the newspapers that I was talked about in Wall Street．The day was past when an operator swinging a line of two hundred thousand shares of stock could dominate the market．But，as you know，the public always desires to find successors to the old leaders．It was Mr．Keene's reputation as a skilful stock operator，a winner of millions on his own hook，that made promoters and banking houses apply to him for selling large blocks of securities．In short，his services as manipulator were in demand because of the stories the Street had heard about his previous successes as a trader．

But Keene was gone—passed on to that heaven where he once said he wouldn't stay a moment unless he found Sysonby there waiting for him．Two or three other men who made stock-market history for a few months had relapsed into the obscurity of prolonged inactivity．I refer particularly to certain of those plunging Westerners who came to Wall Street in 1901 and after making many millions out of their Steel holdings remained in Wall Street．They were in reality super promoters rather than operators of the Keene type．But they were extremely able，extremely rich and extremely successful in the securities of the companies which they and their friends controlled．They were not really great manipulators，like Keene or Governor Flower．Still，the Street found in them plenty to gossip about and they certainly had a following among the professionals and the sportier commission houses．After they ceased to trade actively the Street found itself without manipulators；at least，it couldn't read about them in the newspapers．

You remember the big bull market that began when the Stock Exchange resumed business in 1915．As the market broadened and the Allies' purchases in this country mounted into billions we ran into a boom．As far as manipulation went，it wasn't necessary for anybody to lift a finger to create an unlimited market for a war bride．Scores of men made millions by capitalizing contracts or even promises of contracts．They became successful promoters，either with the aid of friendly bankers or by bringing out their companies on the Curb market．The public bought anything that was adequately touted．

When the bloom wore off the boom，some of these promoters found themselves in need of help from experts in stock salesmanship．When the public is hung up with all kinds of securities，some of them purchased at higher prices，it is not an easy task to dispose of untried stocks．After a boom the public is positive that nothing is going up．It isn't that buyers become more discriminating，but that the blind buying is over．It is the state of mind that has changed．Prices don't even have to go down to make people pessimistic．It is enough if the market gets dull and stays dull for a time．

In every boom companies are formed primarily if not exclusively to take advantage of the public's appetite for all kinds of stocks．Also there are belated promotions．The reason why promoters make that mistake is that being human they are unwilling to see the end of the boom．More-over，it is good business to take chances when the possible profit is big enough．The top is never in sight when the vision is vitiated by hope．The average man sees a stock that nobody wanted at twelve dollars or fourteen dollars a share suddenly advance to thirty—which surely is the top—until it rises to fifty．That is absolutely the end of the rise．Then it goes to sixty；to seventy；to seventy-five．It then becomes a certainty that this stock，which a few weeks ago was selling for less than fifteen，can't go any higher．But it goes to eighty；and to eighty-five．Whereupon the average man，who never thinks of values but of prices，and is not governed in his actions by conditions but by fears，takes the easiest way—he stops thinking that there must be a limit to the advances．That is why those outsiders who are wise enough not to buy at the top make up for it by not taking profits．The big money in booms is always made first by the public—on paper．And it remains on paper．





Chapter XXII


ONE day Jim Barnes，who not only was one of my principal brokers but an intimate friend as well，called on me．He said he wanted me to do him a great favour．He never before had talked that way，and so I asked him to tell me what the favour was，hoping it was something I could do，for I certainly wished to oblige him．He then told me that his firm was interested in a certain stock；in fact，they had been the principal promoters of the company and had placed the greater part of the stock．Circumstances had arisen that made it imperative for them to market a rather large block．Jim wanted me to undertake to do the marketing for him．The stock was Consolidated Stove．

I did not wish to have anything to do with it for various reasons．But Barnes，to whom I was under some obligations，insisted on the personal-favour phase of the matter，which alone could overcome my objections．He was a good fellow，a friend，and his firm，I gathered，was pretty heavily involved，so in the end I consented to do what I could．

It has always seemed to me that the most picturesque point of difference between the war boom and other booms was the part that was played by a type new in stock-market affairs—the boy banker．

The boom was stupendous and its origins and causes were plainly to be grasped by all．But at the same time the greatest banks and trust companies in the country certainly did all they could to help make millionaires overnight of all sorts and conditions of promoters and munition makers．It got so that all a man had to do was to say that he had a friend who was a friend of a member of one of the Allied commissions and he would be offered all the capital needed to carry out the contracts he had not yet secured．I used to hear incredible stories of clerks becoming presidents of companies doing a business of millions of dollars on money borrowed from trusting trust companies，and of contracts that left a trail of profits as they passed from man to man．A flood of gold was pouring into this country from Europe and the banks had to find ways of impounding it．

The way business was done might have been regarded with misgivings by the old，but there didn't seem to be so many of them about．The fashion for gray-haired presidents of banks was all very well in tranquil times，but youth was the chief qualification in these strenuous times．The banks certainly did make enormous profits．

Jim Barnes and his associates，enjoying the friendship and confidence of the youthful president of the Marshall National Bank，decided to consolidate three well-known stove compames and sell the stock of the new company to the public that for months had been buying any old thing in the way of engraved stock certificates．

One trouble was that the stove business was so prosperous that all three companies were actually earning dividends on their common stock for the first time in their history．Their principal stockholders did not wish to part with the control．There was a good market for their stocks on the Curb；and they had sold as much as they cared to part with and they were content with things as they were．Their individual capitalisation was too small to justify big market movements，and that is where Jim Barnes' firm came in．It pointed out that the consolidated company must be big enough to list on the Stock Exchange，where the new shares could be made more valuable than the old ones．It is an old device in Wall Street—to change the colour of the certificates in order to make them more valuable．Say a stock ceases to be easily vendible at par．Well，sometimes by quadrupling the stock you may make the new shares sell at 30 or 35．This is equivalent to 120 or 140 for the old stock—a figure it never could have reached．

It seems that Barnes and his associates succeeded in inducing some of their friends who held speculatively some blocks of Gray Stove Company—a large concern—to come into the consolidation on the basis of four shares of Consolidated for each share of Gray．Then the Midland and the Western followed their big sister and came in on the basis of share for share．Theirs had been quoted on the Curb at around 25 to 30，and the Gray，which was better known and paid dividends，hung around 125．

In order to raise the money to buy out those holders who insisted upon selling for cash，and also to provide additional working capital for improvements and promotion expenses，it became necessary to raise a few millions．So Barnes saw the president of his bank，who kindly lent his syndicate three million five hundred thousand dollars．The collateral was one hundred thousand shares of the newly organised corporation．The syndicate assured the president，or so I was told，that the price would not go below 50．It would be a very profitable deal as there was big value there．

The promoters' first mistake was in the matter of timeliness．The saturation point for new stock issues had been reached by the market，and they should have seen it．But even then they might have made a fair profit after all if they had not tried to duplicate the unreasonable killings which other promoters had made at the very height of the boom．

Now you must not run away with the notion that Jim Barnes and his associates were fools or inexperienced kids．They were shrewd men．All of them were familiar with Wall Street methods and some of them were exceptionally successful stock traders．But they did rather more than merely overestimate the public's buying capacity．After all，that capacity was something that they could determine only by actual tests．Where they erred more expensively was in expecting the bull market to last longer than it did．I suppose the reason was that these same men had met with such great and particularly with such quick success that they didn't doubt they'd be all through with the deal before the bull market turned．They were all well known and had a considerable following among the professional traders and the wire houses．

The deal was extremely well advertised．The newspapers certainly were generous with their space．The older concerns were identified with the stove industry of America and their product was known the world over．It was a patriotic amalgamation and there was a heap of literature in the daily papers about the world conquests．The markets of Asia，Africa and South America were as good as cinched．

The directors of the company were all men whose names were familiar to all readers of the financial pages．The publicity work was so well handled and the promises of unnamed insiders as to what the price was going to do were so definite and convincing that a great demand for the new stock was created．The result was that when the books were closed it was found that the stock which was offered to the public at fifty dollars a share had been oversubscribed by 25 per cent．

Think of it！The best the promoters should have expected was to succeed in selling the new stock at that price after weeks of work and after putting up the price to 75 or higher in order to average 50．At that，it meant an advance of about 100 per cent in the old prices of the stocks of the constituent companies．That was the crisis and they did not meet it as it should have been met．It shows you that every business has its own needs．General wisdom is less valuable than specific savvy．The promoters，delighted by the unexpected oversubscription，concluded that the public was ready to pay any price for any quantity of that stock．And they actually were stupid enough to underallot the stock．After the promoters made up their minds to be hoggish they should have tried to be intelligently hoggish．

What they should have done，of course，was to allot the stock in full．That would have made them short to the extent of 25 per cent of the total amount offered for subscription to the public，and that，of course，would have enabled them to support the stock when necessary and at no cost to themselves．Without any effort on their part they would have been in the strong strategic position that I always try to find myself in when I am manipulating a stock．They could have kept the price from sagging，thereby inspiring confidence in the new stock's price stability and in the underwriting syndicate back of it．They should have remembered that their work was not over when they sold the stock offered to the public．That was only a part of what they had to market．

They thought they had been very successful，but it was not long before the consequences of their two capital blunders became apparent．The public did not buy any more of the new stock，because the entire market developed reactionary tendencies．The insiders got cold feet and did not support Consolidated Stove；and if insiders don't buy their own stock on recessions，who should？The absence of inside support is generally accepted as a pretty good bear tip．

There is no need to go into statistical details．The price of Consolidated Stove fluctuated with the rest of the market，but it never went above the initial market quotations，which were only a fraction above 50．Barnes and his friends in the end had to come in as buyers in order to keep it above 40．Not to have supported that stock at the outset of its market career was regrettable．But not to have sold all the stock the public subscribed for was much worse．

At all events，the stock was duly listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the price of it duly kept sagging until it nominally stood at 37．And it stood there because Jim Barnes and his associates had to keep it there because their bank had loaned them thirty-five dollars a share on one hundred thousand shares．If the bank ever tried to liquidate that loan there was no telling what the price would break to．The public that had been eager to buy it at 50，now didn't care for it at 37，and probably wouldn't want it at 27．

As time went on the banks' excesses in the matter of extensions of credits made people think．The day of the boy banker was over．The banking business appeared to be on the ragged edge of suddenly relapsing into conservatism．Intimate friends were now asked to pay off loans，for all the world as though they had never played golf with the president．

There was no need to threaten on the lender's part or to plead for more time on the borrower's．The situation was highly uncomfortable for both．The bank，for example，with which my friend Jim Barnes did business，was still kindly disposed．But it was a case of“For heaven's sake take up that loan or we'll all be in a dickens of a mess！”

The character of the mess and its explosive possibilities were enough to make Jim Barnes come to me to ask me to sell the one hundred thousand shares for enough to pay off the bank's three-million-five-hundred-thousand-dollar loan．Jim did not now expect to make a profit on that stock．If the syndicate only made a small loss on it they would be more than grateful．

It seemed a hopeless task．The general market was neither active nor strong，though at times there were rallies，when everybody perked up and tried to believe the bull swing was about to resume．

The answer I gave Barnes was that I'd look into the matter and let him know under what conditions I'd undertake the work．Well，I did look into it．I didn't analyse the company's last annual report．My studies were confined to the stockmarket phases of the problem．I was not going to tout the stock for a rise on its earnings or its prospects，but to dispose of that block in the open market．All I considered was what should，could or might help or hinder me in that task．

I discovered for one thing that there was too much stock held by too few people—that is，too much for safety and far too much for comfort．Clifton P．Kane & Co.，bankers and brokers，members of the New York Stock Exchange，were carrying seventy thousand shares．They were intimate friends of Barnes and had been influential in effecting the consolidation，as they had made a specialty of stove stocks for years．Their customers had been let into the good thing．Ex-Senator Samuel Gordon，who was the special partner in his nephews' firm，Gordon Bros.，was the owner of a second block of seventy thousand shares；and the famous Joshua Wolff had sixty thousand shares．This made a total of two hundred thousand shares of Consolidated Stove held by this handful of veteran Wall Street professionals．They did not need any kind person to tell them when to sell their stock．If I did anything in the manipulating line calculated to bring in public buying—that is to say，if I made the stock strong and active—I could see Kane and Gordon and Wolff unloading，and not in homeopathic doses either．The vision of their two hundred thousand shares Niagaraing into the market was not exactly entrancing．Don't forget that the cream was off the bull movement and that no overwhelming demand was going to be manufactured by my operations，however skilfully conducted they might be．Jim Barnes had no illusions about the job he was modestly sidestepping in my favour．He had given me a waterlogged stock to sell on a bull market that was about to breathe its last．Of course there was no talk in the newspapers about the ending of the bull market，but I knew it，and Jim Barnes knew it，and you bet the bank knew it．

Still，I had given Jim my word，so I sent for Kane，Gordon and Wolff．Their two hundred thousand shares was the sword of Damocles．I thought I'd like to substitute a steel chain for the hair．The easiest way，it seemed to me，was by some sort of reciprocity agreement．If they helped me passively by holding off while I sold the bank's one hundred thousand shares，I would help them actively by trying to make a market for all of us to unload on．As things were，they couldn't sell one-tenth of their holdings without having Consolidated Stove break wide open，and they knew it so well that they had never dreamed of trying．All I asked of them was judgment in timing the selling and an intelligent unselfishness in order not to be unintelligently selfish．It never pays to be a dog in the manger in Wall Street or anywhere else．I desired to convince them that premature or ill-considered unloading would prevent complete unloading．Time urged．

I hoped my proposition would appeal to them because they were experienced Wall Street men and had no illusions about the actual demand for Consolidated Stove．Clifton P．Kane was the head of a prosperous commission house with branches in eleven cities and customers by the hundreds．His firm had acted as managers for more than one pool in the past．

Senator Gordon，who held seventy thousand shares，was an exceedingly wealthy man．His name was as familiar to the readers of the metropolitan press as though he had been sued for breach of promise by a sixteen-year-old manicurist possassing a five-thousand-dollar mink coat and one hundred and thirty-two letters from the defendant．He had started his nephews in business as brokers and he was a special partner in their firm．He had been in dozens of pools．He had inherited a large interest in the Midland Stove Company and he got one hundred thousand shares of Consolidated Stove for it．He had been carrying enough to disregard Jim Barnes' wild bull tips and had cashed in on thirty thousand shares before the market petered out on him．He told a friend later that he would have sold more only the other big holders，who were old and intimate friends，pleaded with him not to sell any more，and out of regard for them he stopped．Besides which，as I said，he had no market to unload on．

The third man was Joshua Wolff．He was probably the best known of all the traders．For twenty years everybody had known him as one of the plungers on the floor．In bidding up stocks or offering them down he had few equals，for ten or twenty thousand shares meant no more to him than two or three hundred．Before I came to New York I had heard of him as a plunger．He was then trailing with a sporting coterie that played a no limit game，whether on the race track or in the stock market．

They used to accuse him of being nothing but a gambler，but he had real ability and a strongly developed aptitude for the speculative game．At the same time his reputed indifference to highbrow pursuits made him the hero of numberless anecdotes．One of the most widely circulated of the yarns was that Joshua was a guest at what he called a swell dinner and by some oversight of the hostess several of the other guests began to discuss literature before they could be stopped．

A girl who sat next to Josh and had not heard him use his mouth except for masticating purposes，turned to him and looking anxious to hear the great financier's opinion asked him，“Oh，Mr．Wolff，what do you think of Balzac？”

Josh politely ceased to masticate，swallowed and answered，“I never trade in them Curb stocks！”

Such were the three largest individual holders of Consolidated Stove．When they came over to see me I told them that if they formed a syndicate to put up some cash and gave me a call on their stock at a little above the market I would do what I could to make a market．They promptly asked me how much money would be required．

I answered，“You've had that stock a long time and you can't do a thing with it．Between the three of you you've got two hundred thousand shares，and you know very well that you haven't the slightest chance of getting rid of it unless you make a market for it．It's got to be some market to absorb what you've got to give it，and it will be wise to have enough cash to pay for whatever stock it may be necessary to buy at first．It's no use to begin and then have to stop because there isn't enough money．I suggest that you form a syndicate and raise six millions in cash．Then give the syndicate a call on your two hundred thousand shares at 40 and put all your stock in escrow．If everything goes well you chaps will get rid of your dead pet and the syndicate will make some money．”

As I told you before，there had been all sorts of rumours about my stock-market winnings．I suppose that helped，for nothing succeeds like success．At all events，I didn't have to do much explaining to these chaps．They knew exactly how far they'd get if they tried to play a lone hand．They thought mine was a good plan．When they went away they said they would form the syndicate at once．

They didn't have much trouble in inducing a lot of their friends to join them．I suppose they spoke with more assurance than I had of the syndicate's profits．From all I heard they really believed it，so theirs were no conscienceless tips．At all events the syndicate was formed in a couple of days．Kane，Gordon and Wolff gave calls on the two hundred thousand shares at 40 and I saw to it that the stock itself was put in escrow，so that none of it would come out on the market if I should put up the price．I had to protect myself．More than one promising deal has failed to pan out as expected because the members of the pool or clique failed to keep faith with one another．Dog has no foolish prejudices against eating dog in Wall Street．At the time the second American Steel and Wire Company was brought out the insiders accused one another of breach of faith and trying to unload．There had been a gentlemen's agreement between John W．Gates and his pals and the Seligmans and their banking associates．Well，I heard somebody in a broker's office reciting this quatrain，which was said to have been composed by John W．Gates：

The tarantula jumped on the centipede's back

And chortled with ghoulish glee：

“I'll poison this murderous son of a gun．

If I don't he'll poison me！”

Mind you，I do not mean for one moment to imply that any of my friends in Wall Street would even dream of double-crossing me in a stock deal．But on general principles it is just as well to provide for any and all contingencies．It's plain sense．

After Wolff and Kane and Gordon told me that they had formed their syndicate to put up six millions in cash there was nothing for me to do but wait for the money to come in．I had urged the vital need of haste．Nevertheless the money came in driblets．I think it took four or five installments．I don't know what the reason was，but I remember that I had to send out an S O S call to Wolff and Kane and Gordon．

That afternoon I got some big checks that brought the cash in my possession to about four million dollars and the promise of the rest in a day or two．It began at last to look as though the syndicate might do something before the bull market passed away．At best it would be no cinch，and the sooner I began work the better．The public had not been particularly keen about new market movements in inactive stocks．But a man could do a great deal to arouse interest in any stock with four millions in cash．It was enough to absorb all the probable offerings．If time urged，as I had said，there was no sense in waiting for the other two millions．The sooner the stock got up to 50 the better for the syndicate．That was obvious．

The next morning at the opening I was surprised to see that there were unusually heavy dealings in Consolidated Stove．As I told you before，the stock had been waterlogged for months．The price had been pegged at 37，Jim Barnes taking good care not to let it go any lower on account of the big bank loan at 35．But as for going any higher，he'd as soon expect to see the Rock of Gibraltar shimmying across the Strait as to see Consolidated Stove do any climbing on the tape．

Well，sir，this morning there was quite a demand for the stock，and the price went up to 39．In the first hour of the trading the transactions were heavier than for the whole previous half year．It was the sensation of the day and affected bullishly the entire market．I heard afterwards that nothing else was talked about in the customers' rooms of the commission houses．

I didn't know what it meant，but it didn't hurt my feelings any to see Consolidated Stove perk up．As a rule I do not have to ask about any unusual movement in any stock because my friends on the floor—brokers who do business for me，as well as personal friends among the room traders—keep me posted．They assume I'd like to know and they telephone me any news or gossip they pick up．On this day all I heard was that there was unmistakable inside buying in Consolidated Stove．There wasn't any washing．It was all genuine．The purchasers took all the offerings from 37 to 39 and when importuned for reasons or begged for a tip，flatly refused to give any．This made the wily and watchful traders conclude that there was something doing；something big．When a stock goes up on buying by insiders who refuse to encourage the world at large to follow suit the ticker hounds begin to wonder aloud when the official notice will be given out．

I didn't do anything myself．I watched and wondered and kept track of the transactions．But on the next day the buying was not only greater in volume but more aggressive in character．The selling orders that had been on the specialists' books for months at above the pegged price of 37 were absorbed without any trouble，and not enough new selling orders came in to check the rise．Naturally，up went the price．It crossed 40．Presently it touched 42．

The moment it touched that figure I felt that I was justified in starting to sell the stock the bank held as collateral．Of course I figured that the price would go down on my selling，but if my average on the entire line was 37 I'd have no fault to find．I knew what the stock was worth and I had gathered some idea of the vendibility from the months of inactivity．Well，sir，I let them have stock carefully until I had got rid of thirty thousand shares．And the advance was not checked！

That afternoon I was told the reason for that opportune but mystifying rise．It seems that the floor traders had been tipped off after the close the night before and also the next morning before the opening，that I was bullish as blazes on Consolidated Stove and was going to rush the price right up fifteen or twenty points without a reaction，as was my custom—that is，my custom according to people who never kept my books．The tipster in chief was no less a personage than Joshua Wolff．It was his own inside buying that started the rise of the day before．His cronies among the floor traders were only too willing to follow his tip，for he knew too much to give wrong steers to his fellows．

As a matter of fact，there was not so much stock pressing on the market as had been feared．Consider that I had tied up three hundred thousand shares and you will realise that the old fears had been well founded．It now proved less of a job than I had anticipated to put up the stock．After all，Governor Flower was right．Whenever he was accused of manipulating his firm's specialties，like Chicago Gas，Federal Steel or B．R．T.，he used to say：“The only way I know of making a stock go up is to buy it．”That also was the floor traders' only way，and the price responded．

On the next day，before breakfast，I read in the morning papers what was read by thousands and what undoubtedly was sent over the wires to hundreds of branches and out-of-town offices，and that was that Larry Livingston was about to begin active bull operations in Consolidated Stove．The additional details differed．One version had it that I had formed an insiders' pool and was going to punish the overextended short interest．Another hinted at dividend announcements in the near future．Another reminded the world that what I usually did to a stock I was bullish on was something to remember．Still another accused the company of concealing its assets in order to permit accumulation by insiders．And all of them agreed that the rise hadn't fairly started．

By the time I reached my office and read my mail before the market opened I was made aware that the Street was flooded with red-hot tips to buy Consolidated Stove at once．My telephone bell kept ringing and the clerk who answered the calls heard the same question asked in one form or another a hundred times that morning：Was it true that Consolidated Stove was going up？I must say that Joshua Wolff and Kane and Gordon—and possibly Jim Barnes—handled that little tipping job mighty well．

I had no idea that I had such a following．Why，that morning the buying orders came in from all over the country—orders to buy thousands of shares of a stock that nobody wanted at any price three days before．And don't forget that，as a matter of fact，all that the public had to go by was my newspaper reputation as a successful plunger；something for which I had to thank an imaginative reporter or two．

Well，sir，on that，the third day of the rise，I sold Consolidated Stove；and on the fourth day and the fifth；and the first thing I knew I had sold for Jim Barnes the one hundred thousand shares of stock which the Marshall National Bank held as collateral on the three-million-five-hundred-thousand-dollar loan that needed paying off．If the most successful manipulation consists of that in which the desired end is gained at the least possible cost to the manipulator，the Consolidated Stove deal is by all means the most successful of my Wall Street career．Why，at no time did I have to take any stock．I didn't have to buy first in order to sell the more easily later on．I did not put up the price to the highest possible point and then begin my real selling．I didn't even do my principal selling on the way down，but on the way up．It was like a dream of Paradise to find an adequate buying power created for you without your stirring a finger to bring it about，particularly when you were in a hurry．I once heard a friend of Governor Flower's say that in one of the great bull-leader's operations for the account of a pool in B．R．T．the pool sold fifty thousand shares of the stock at a profit，but Flower & Co．got commissions on more than two hundred and fifty thousand shares and W．P．Hamilton says that to distribute two hundred and twenty thousand shares of Amalgamated Copper，James R．Keene must have traded in at least seven hundred thousand shares of the stock during the necessary manipulation．Some commission bill！Think of that and then consider that the only commissions that I had to pay were the commissions on the one hundred thousand shares I actually sold for Jim Barnes．I call that some saving．

Having sold what I had engaged to sell for my friend Jim，and all the money the syndicate had agreed to raise not having been sent in，and feeling no desire to buy back any of the stock I had sold，I rather think I went away somewhere for a short vacation．I do not remember exactly．But I do remember very well that I let the stock alone and that it was not long before the price began to sag．One day，when the entire market was weak，some disappointed bull wanted to get rid of his Consolidated Stove in a hurry，and on his offerings the stock broke below the call price，which was 40．Nobody seemed to want any of it．As I told you before，I wasn't bullish on the general situation and that made me more grateful than ever for the miracle that had enabled me to dispose of the one hundred thousand shares without having to put the price up twenty or thirty points in a week，as the kindly tipsters had prophesied．

Finding no support，the price developed a habit of declining regularly until one day it broke rather badly and touched 32．That was the lowest that had ever been recorded for it，for，as you will remember，Jim Barnes and the original syndicate had pegged it at 37 in order not to have their one hundred thousand shares dumped on the market by the bank．

I was in my office that day peacefully studying the tape when Joshua Wolff was announced．I said I would see him．He rushed in．He is not a very large man，but he certainly seemed all swelled up—with anger，as I instantly discovered．

He ran to where I stood by the ticker and yelled，“Hey？What the devil's the matter？”

“Have a chair，Mr．Wolff，”I said politely and sat down myself to encourage him to talk calmly．

“I don't want any chair！I want to know what it means！”he cried at the top of his voice．

“What does what mean？”

“What in hell are you doing to it？”

“What am I doing to what？”

“That stock！That stock！”

“What stock？”I asked him．

But that only made him see red，for he shouted，“Consolidated Stove！What are you doing to it？”

“Nothing！Absolutely nothing．What's wrong？”I said．

He stared at me fully five seconds before he exploded：“Look at the price！Look at it！”

He certainly was angry．So I got up and looked at the tape．

I said，“The price of it is now 31¼”

“Yeh ！Thirty-one and a quarter，and I've got a raft of it．”

I know you have sixty thousand shares．You have had it a long time，because when you originally bought your Gray Stove—”

But he didn't let me finish．He said，“But I bought a lot more．Some of it cost me as high as 40！And I've got it yet！”

He was glaring at me so hostilely that I said，“I didn't tell you to buy it．”

“You didn't what？”

“I didn't tell you to load up with it．”

“I didn't say you did．But you were going to put it up—”

“Why was I？”I interrupted．

He looked at me，unable to speak for anger．When he found his voice again，he said，“You were going to put it up．You had the money to buy it．”

“Yes．But I didn't buy a share，”I told him．

That was the last straw．

“You didn't buy a share，and you had over four millions in cash to buy with？You didn't buy any？”

“Not a share！”I repeated．

He was so mad by now that he couldn't talk plainly．Finally he managed to say，“What kind of a game do you call that？”

He was inwardly accusing me of all sorts of unspeakable crimes．I sure could see a long list of them in his eyes．It made me say to him：“What you really mean to ask me，Wolff，is，why I didn't buy from you above 50 the stock you bought below 40．Isn't that it？”

“No，it isn't．You had a call at 40 and four millions in cash to put up the price with．”

“Yes，but I didn't touch the money and the syndicate has not lost a cent by my operations．”

“Look here，Livingston—”he began．

But I didn't let him say any more．

“You listen to me，Wolff．You knew that the two hundred thousand shares you and Gordon and Kane held were tied up，and that there wouldn't be an awful lot of floating stock to come on the market if I put up the price，as I'd have to do for two reasons：The first to make a market for the stock；and the second to make a profit out of the call at 40．But you weren't satisfied to get 40 for the sixty thousand shares you'd been lugging for months or with your share of the syndicate profits，if any；so you decided to take on a lot of stock under 40 to unload on me when I put the price up with the syndicate's money，as you were sure I meant to do．You'd buy before I did and you'd unload before I did；in all probability I'd be the one to unload on．I suspect you figured on my having to put the price up to 60．It was such a cinch that you probably bought ten thousand shares strictly for unloading purposes，and to make sure somebody held the bag if I didn't，you tipped off everybody in the United States，Canada and Mexico without thinking of my added difficulties．All your friends knew what I was supposed to do．Between their buying and mine you were going to be all hunky．Well，your intimate friends to whom you gave the tip passed it on to their friends after they had bought their lines，and the third stratum of tip-takers planned to supply the fourth，fifth and possibly sixth strata of suckers，so that when I finally came to do some selling I'd find myself anticipated by a few thousands of wise speculators．It was a friendly thought，that notion of yours，Wolff．You can't imagine how surprised I was when Consolidated Stove began to go up before I even thought of buying a single share；or how grateful，either，when the underwriting syndicate sold one hundred thousand shares around 40 to the people who were going to sell those same shares to me at 50 or 60．I sure was a sucker not to use the four millions to make money for them，wasn't I？The cash was supplied to buy stock with，but only if I thought it necessary to do so．Well，I didn't．”

Joshua had been in Wall Street long enough not to let anger interfere with business．He cooled off as he heard me，and when I was through talking he said in a friendly tone of voice，“Look here，Larry，old chap，what shall we do？”

“Do whatever you please．”

“Aw，be a sport．What would you do if you were in our place？”

“If I were in your place，”I said solemnly，“do you know what I'd do？”

“What ？”

“I'd sell out ！”I told him．

He looked at me a moment，and without another word turned on his heel and walked out of my office．He's never been in it since．

Not long after that，Senator Gordon also called．He，too，was quite peevish and blamed me for their troubles．Then Kane joined the anvil chorus．They forgot that their stock had been unsalable in bulk when they formed the syndicate．All they could remember was that I didn't sell their holdings when I had the syndicate's millions and the stock was active at 44，and that now it was 30 and dull as dishwater．To their way of thinking I should have sold out at a good fat profit．

Of course they also cooled down in due time．The syndicate wasn't out a cent and the main problem remained unchanged：to sell their stock．A day or two later they came back and asked me to help them out．Gordon was particularly insistent，and in the end I made them put in their pooled stock at 25½．My fee for my services was to be one-half of whatever I got above that figure．The last sale had been at about 30．

There I was with their stock to liquidate．Given general market conditions and specifically the behaviour of Consolidated Stove，there was only one way to do it，and that was，of course，to sell on the way down and without first trying to put up the price，and I certainly would have got stock by the ream on the way up．But on the way down I could reach those buyers who always argue that a stock is cheap when it sells fifteen or twenty points below the top of the movement，particularly when that top is a matter of recent history．A rally is due，in their opinion．After seeing Consolidated Stove sell up to close to 44 it sure looked like a good thing below 30．

It worked out as always．Bargain hunters bought it in sufficient volume to enable me to liquidate the pool's holdings．But do you think that Gordon or Wolff or Kane felt any gratitude？Not a bit of it．They are still sore at me，or so their friends tell me．They often tell people how I did them．They cannot forgive me for not putting up the price on myself，as they expected．

As a matter of fact I never would have been able to sell the bank's hundred thousand shares if Wolff and the rest had not passed around those red-hot bull tips of theirs．If I had worked as I usually do—that is，in a logical natural way—I would have had to take whatever price I could get．I told you we ran into a declining market．The only way to sell on such a market is to sell not necessarily recklessly but really regardless of price．No other way was possible，but I suppose they do not believe this．They are still angry．I am not．Getting angry doesn't get a man anywhere．More than once it has been borne in on me that a speculator who loses his temper is a goner．In this case there was no aftermath to the grouches．But I'll tell you something curious．One day Mrs．Livingston went to a dressmaker who had been warmly recommended to her．The woman was competent and obliging and had a very pleasing personality．At the third or fourth visit，when the dressmaker felt less like a stranger，she said to Mrs．Livingston：“I hope Mr．Livingston puts up Consolidated Stove soon．We have some that we bought because we were told he was going to put it up，and we'd always heard that he was very successful in all his deals．”

I tell you it isn't pleasant to think that innocent people may have lost money following a tip of that sort．Perhaps you understand why I never give any myself．That dressmaker made me feel that in the matter of grievances I had a real one against Wolff．





Chapter XXIII


SPECULATION in stocks will never disappear．It isn't desirable that it should．It cannot be checked by warnings as to its dangers．You cannot prevent people from guessing wrong no matter how able or how experienced they may be．Carefully laid plans will miscarry because the unexpected and even the unexpectable will happen．Disaster may come from a convulsion of nature or from the weather，from your own greed or from some man's vanity；from fear or from uncontrolled hope．But apart from what one might call his natural foes，a speculator in stocks has to contend with certain practices or abuses that are indefensible morally as well as commercially．

As I look back and consider what were the common practices twenty-five years ago when I first came to Wall Street，I have to admit that there have been many changes for the better．The old-fashioned bucket shops are gone，though bucketeering“brokerage”houses still prosper at the expense of men and women who persist in playing the game of getting rich quick．The Stock Exchange is doing excellent work not only in getting after these out-and-out swindlers but in insisting upon strict adherence to its rules by its own members．Many wholesome regulations and restrictions are now strictly enforced but there is still room for improvement．The ingrained conservatism of Wall Street rather than ethical callousness is to blame for the persistence of certain abuses．

Difficult as profitable stock speculation always has been it is becoming even more difficult every day．It was not so long ago when a real trader could have a good working knowledge of practically every stock on the list．In 1901，when J．P．Morgan brought out the United States Steel Corporation，which was merely a consolidation of lesser consolidations most of which were less than two years old，the Stock Exchange had 275 stocks on its list and about 100 in its“unlisted department”；and this included a lot that a chap didn't have to know anything about because they were small issues，or inactive by reason of being minority or guaranteed stocks and therefore lacking in speculative attractions．In fact，an overwhelming majority were stocks in which there had not been a sale in years．Today there are about 900 stocks on the regular list and in our recent active markets about 600 separate issues were traded in．Moreover，the old groups or classes of stocks were easier to keep track of．They not only were fewer but the capitalization was smaller and the news a trader had to be on the lookout for did not cover so wide a field．But today，a man is trading in everything；almost every industry in the world is represented．It requires more time and more work to keep posted and to that extent stock speculation has become much more difficult for those who operate intelligently．

There are many thousands of people who buy and sell stocks speculatively but the number of those who speculate profitably is small．As the public always is“in”the market to some extent，it follows that there are losses by the public all the time．The speculator's deadly enemies are：Ignorance，greed，fear and hope．All the statute books in the world and all the rules of all the Exchanges on earth cannot eliminate these from the human animal．Accidents which knock carefully conceived plans sky-high also are beyond regulation by bodies of cold-blooded economists or warm-hearted philanthropists．There remains another source of loss and that is，deliberate misinformation as distinguished from straight tips．And because it is apt to come to a stock trader variously disguised and camouflaged，it is the more insidious and dangerous．

The average outsider，of course，trades either on tips or on rumours，spoken or printed，direct or implied．Against ordinary tips you cannot guard．For instance，a lifelong friend sincerely desires to make you rich by telling you what he has done，that is，to buy or sell some stock．His intent is good．If the tip goes wrong what can you do？Also against the professional or crooked tipster the public is protected to about the same extent that he is against gold-bricks or wood-alcohol．But against the typical Wall Street rumours，the speculating public has neither protection nor redress．Wholesale dealers in securities，manipulators，pools and individuals resort to various devices to aid them in disposing of their surplus holdings at the best possible prices．The circulation of bullish items by the newspapers and the tickers is the most pernicious of all．

Get the slips of the financial news-agencies any day and it will surprise you to see how many statements of an implied semi-official nature they print．The authority is some“leading insider”or“a prominent director”or“a high official”or someone“in authority”who presumably knows what he is talking about．Here are today's slips．I pick an item at random．Listen to this：“A leading banker says it is too early yet to expect a declining market．”

Did a leading banker really say that and if he said it why did he say it？Why does he not allow his name to be printed？Is he afraid that people will believe him if he does？

Here is another one about a company the stock of which has been active this week．This time the man who makes the statement is a“prominent director．”Now which—if any—of the company's dozen directors is doing the talking？It is plain that by remaining anonymous nobody can be blamed for any damage that may be done by the statement．

Quite apart from the intelligent study of speculation everywhere the trader in stocks must consider certain facts in connection with the game in Wall Street．In addition to trying to determine how to make money one must also try to keep from losing money．It is almost as important to know what not to do as to know what should be done．It is therefore well to remember that manipulation of some sort enters into practically all advances in individual stocks and that such advances are engineered by insiders with one object in view and one only and that is to sell at the best profit possible．However，the average broker's customer believes himself to be a business man from Missouri if he insists upon being told why a certain stock goes up．Naturally，the manipulators“explain”the advance in a way calculated to facilitate distribution．I am firmly convinced that the public's losses would be greatly reduced if no anonymous statements of a bullish nature were allowed to be printed．I mean statements calculated to make the public buy or hold stocks．

The overwhelming majority of the bullish articles printed on the authority of unnamed directors or insiders convey unreliable and misleading impressions to the public．The public loses many millions of dollars every year by accepting such statements as semi-official and therefore trustworthy．

Say for example that a company has gone through a period of depression in its particular line of business．The stock is inactive．The quotation represents the general and presumably accurate belief of its actual value．If the stock were too cheap at that level somebody would know it and buy it and it would advance．If too dear somebody would know enough to sell it and the price would decline．As nothing happens one way or another nobody talks about it or does anything．

The turn comes in the line of business the company is engaged in．Who are the first to know it，the insiders or the public？You can bet it isn't the public．What happens next？Why，if the improvement continues the earnings will increase and the company will be in position to resume dividends on the stock；or，if dividends were not discontinued，to pay a higher rate．That is，the value of the stock will increase．

Say that the improvement keeps up．Does the management make public that glad fact？Does the president tell the stockholders？Does a philanthropic director come out with a signed statement for the benefit of that part of the public that reads the financial page in the newspapers and the slips of the news agencies？Does some modest insider pursuing his usual policy of anonymity come out with an unsigned statement to the effect that the company's future is most promising？Not this time．Not a word is said by anyone and no statement whatever is printed by newspapers or tickers．

The value-making information is carefully kept from the public while the now taciturn“prominent insiders”go into the market and buy all the cheap stock they can lay their hands on．As this well-informed but unostentatious buying keeps on，the stock rises．The financial reporters，knowing that the insiders ought to know the reason for the rise，ask questions．The unanimously anonymous insiders unanimously declare that they have no news to give out．They do not know that there is any warrant for the rise．Sometimes they even state that they are not particularly concerned with the vagaries of the stock market or the actions of stock speculators．

The rise continues and there comes a happy day when those who know have all the stock they want or can carry．The Street at once begins to hear all kinds of bullish rumours．The tickers tell the traders“on good authority”that the company has definitely turned the corner．The same modest director who did not wish his name used when he said he knew no warrant for the rise in the stock is now quoted—of course not by name—as saying that the stockholders have every reason to feel greatly encouraged over the outlook．

Urged by the deluge of bullish news items the public begins to buy the stock．These purchases help to put the price still higher．In due course the predictions of the uniformly unnamed directors come true and the company resumes dividend payments；or increases the rate，as the case may be．With that the bullish items multiply．They not only are more numerous than ever but much more enthusiastic．A“leading director，”asked point blank for a statement of conditions，informs the world that the improvement is more than keeping up．A“prominent insider，”after much coaxing，is finally induced by a news-agency to confess that the earnings are nothing short of phenomenal．A“well-known banker，”who is affiliated in a business way with the company，is made to say that the expansion in the volume of sales is simply unprecedented in the history of the trade．If not another order came in the company would run night and day for heaven knows how many months．A“member of the finance committee，”in a double-leaded manifesto，expresses his astonishment at the public's astonishment over the stock's rise．The only astonishing thing is the stock's moderation in the climbing line．Anybody who will analyse the forthcoming annual report can easily figure how much more than the market-price the book-value of the stock is．But in no instance is the name of the communicative philanthropist given．

As long as the earnings continue good and the insiders do not discern any sign of a let up in the company's prosperity they sit on the stock they bought at the low prices．There is nothing to put the price down，so why should they sell？But the moment there is a turn for the worse in the company's business，what happens？Do they come out with statements or warnings or the faintest of hints？Not much．The trend is now downward．Just as they bought without any flourish of trumpets when the company's business turned for the better，they now silently sell．On this inside selling the stock naturally declines．Then the public begins to get the familiar“explanations．”A“leading insider”asserts that everything is O．K．and the decline is merely the result of selling by bears who are trying to affect the general market．If on one fine day，after the stock has been declining for some time，there should be a sharp break，the demand for“reasons”or“explanations”becomes clamorous．Unless somebody says something the public will fear the worst．So the news-tickers now print something like this：“When we asked a prominent director of the company to explain the weakness in the stock，he replied that the only conclusion he could arrive at was that the decline today was caused by a bear drive．Underlying conditions are unchanged．The business of the company was never better than at present and the probabilities are that unless something entirely unforeseen happens in the meanwhile，there will be an increase in the rate at the next dividend meeting．The bear party in the market has become aggressive and the weakness in the stock was clearly a raid intended to dislodge weakly held stock．”The news-tickers，wishing to give good measure，as likely as not will go on to state that they are“reliably informed”that most of the stock bought on the day's decline was taken by inside interests and that the bears will find that they have sold themselves into a trap．There will be a day of reckoning．

In addition to the losses sustained by the public through believing bullish statements and buying stocks，there are the losses that come through being dissuaded from selling out．The next best thing to having people buy the stock the“prominent insider”wishes to sell is to prevent people from selling the same stock when he does not wish to support or accumulate it．What is the public to believe after reading the statement of the“prominent director”？What can the average outsider think？Of course，that the stock should never have gone down；that it was forced down by bear-selling and that as soon as the bears stop the insiders will engineer a punitive advance during which the shorts will be driven to cover at high prices．The public properly believes this because it is exactly what would happen if the decline had in truth been caused by a bear raid．

The stock in question，notwithstanding all the threats or promises of a tremendous squeeze of the over-extended short interest，does not rally．It keeps on going down．It can't help it．There has been too much stock fed to the market from the inside to be digested．

And this inside stock that has been sold by the“prominent directors”and“leading insiders”becomes a football among the professional traders．It keeps on going down．There seems to be no bottom for it．The insiders knowing that trade conditions will adversely affect the company's future earnings do not dare to support that stock until the next turn for the better in the company's business．Then there will be inside buying and inside silence．

I have done my share of trading and have kept fairly well posted on the stock market for many years and I can say that I do not recall an instance when a bear raid caused a stock to decline extensively．What was called bear raiding was nothing but selling based on accurate knowledge of real conditions．But it would not do to say that the stock declined on inside selling or on inside non-buying．Everybody would hasten to sell and when everybody sells and nobody buys there is the dickens to pay．

The public ought to grasp firmly this one point：That the real reason for a protracted decline is never bear raiding．When a stock keeps on going down you can bet there is something wrong with it，either with the market for it or with the company．If the decline were unjustified the stock would soon sell below its real value and that would bring in buying that would check the decline．As a matter of fact，the only time a bear can make big money selling a stock is when that stock is too high．And you can gamble your last cent on the certainty that insiders will not proclaim that fact to the world．

Of course，the classic example is the New Haven．Everybody knows today what only a few knew at the time．The stock sold at 255 in 1902 and was the premier railroad investment of New England．A man in that part of the country measured his respectability and standing in the community by his holdings of it．If somebody had said that the company was on the road to insolvency he would not have been sent to jail for saying it．They would have clapped him in an insane asylum with other lunatics．But when a new and aggressive president was placed in charge by Mr．Morgan and the débâcle began，it was not clear from the first that the new policies would land the road where it did．But as property after property began to be saddled in the Consolidated Road at inflated prices，a few clear sighted observers began to doubt the wisdom of the Mellen policies．A trolley system was bought for two million and sold to the New Haven for $10,000,000；whereupon a reckless man or two committed lèse majeste by saying that the management was acting recklessly．Hinting that not even the New Haven could stand such extravagance was like impugning the strength of Gibraltar．

Of course，the first to see breakers ahead were the insiders．They became aware of the real condition of the company and they reduced their holdings of the stock．On their selling as well as on their non-support，the price of New England's gilt-edged railroad stock began to yield．Questions were asked，and explanations were demanded as usual；and the usual explanations were promptly forthcoming．“Prominent insiders”declared that there was nothing wrong that they knew of and that the decline was due to reckless bear selling．So the“investors”of New England kept their holdings of New York，New Haven & Hartford Stock．Why shouldn't they？Didn't insiders say there was nothing wrong and cry bear selling？Didn't dividends continue to be declared and paid？

In the meantime the promised squeeze of the bears did not come but new low records did．The insider selling became more urgent and less disguised．Nevertheless public spirited men in Boston were denounced as stock-jobbers and demagogues for demanding a genuine explanation for the stock's deplorable decline that meant appalling losses to everybody in New England who had wanted a safe investment and a steady dividend payer．

That historic break from $255 to $12 a share never was and never could have been a bear drive．It was not started and it was not kept up by bear operations．The insiders sold right along and always at higher prices than they could have done if they had told the truth or allowed the truth to be told．It did not matter whether the price was 250 or 200 or 150 or 100 or 50 or 25，it still was too high for that stock，and the insiders knew it and the public did not．The public might profitably consider the disadvantages under which it labours when it tries to make money buying and selling the stock of a company concerning whose affairs only a few men are in position to know the whole truth．

The stocks which have had the worst breaks in the past 20 years did not decline on bear raiding．But the easy acceptance of that form of explanation has been responsible for losses by the public amounting to millions upon millions of dollars．It has kept people from selling who did not like the way his stock was acting and would have liquidated if they had not expected the price to go right back after the bears stopped their raiding．I used to hear Keene blamed in the old days．Before him they used to accuse Charley Woerishoffer or Addison Cammack．Later on I became the stock excuse．

I recall the case of Intervale Oil．There was a pool in it that put the stock up and found some buyers on the advance．The manipulators ran the price to 50．There the pool sold and there was a quick break．The usual demand for explanations followed．Why was Intervale so weak？Enough people asked this question to make the answer important news．One of the financial news tickers called up tire brokers who knew the most about Intervale Oil's advance and ought to he equally well posted as to the decline．What did these brokers，members of the bull pool，say when the news agency asked them for a reason that could be printed and sent broadcast over the country？Why，that Larry Livingston was raiding the market！And that wasn't enough．They added that they were going to“get”him．But of course，the Intervale pool continued to sell．The stock only stood then about $12 a share and they could sell it down to 10 or lower and their average selling price would still be above cost．

It was wise and proper for insiders to sell on the decline．But for outsiders who had paid 35 or 40，it was a different matter．Reading what the tickers printed there outsiders held on and waited for Larry Livingston to get what was coming to him at the hands of the indignant inside pool．

In a bull market and particularly in booms the public at first makes money which it later loses simply by overstaying the bull market．This talk of“bear raids”helps them to overstay．The public should beware of explanations that explain only what unnamed insiders wish the public to believe．





Chapter XXIV


THE public always wants to be told．That is what makes tip-giving and tip-taking universal practices．It is proper that brokers should give their customers trading advice through the medium of their market letters as well as by word of mouth．But brokers should not dwell too strongly on actual conditions because the course of the market is always from six to nine months ahead of actual conditions．Today's earnings do not justify brokers in advising their customers to buy stocks unless there is some assurance that six or nine months from today the business outlook will warrant the belief that the same rate of earnings will be maintained．If on looking that far ahead you can see，reasonably clearly，that conditions are developing which will change the present actual power，the argument about stocks being cheap today will disappear．The trader must look far ahead，but the broker is concerned with getting commissions now；hence the inescapable fallacy of the average market letter．Brokers make their living out of commissions from the public and yet they will try to induce the public through their market letters or by word of mouth to buy the same stocks in which they have received selling orders from insiders or manipulators．

It often happens that an insider goes to the head of a brokerage concern and says：“I wish you'd make a market in which to dispose of 50,000 shares of my stock．”

The broker asks for further details．Let us say that the quoted price of that stock is 50．The insider tells him：“I will give you calls on 5000 shares at 45 and 5000 shares every point up for the entire fifty thousand shares．I also will give you a put on 50,000 shares at the market．”

Now，this is pretty easy money for the broker，if he has a large following and of course this is precisely the kind of broker the insider seeks．A house with direct wires to branches and connections in various parts of the country can usually get a large following in a deal of that kind．Remember that in any event the broker is playing absolutely safe by reason of the put．If he can get his public to follow he will be able to dispose of his entire line at a big profit in addition to his regular commissions．

I have in mind the exploits of an“insider”who is well-known in Wall Street．

He will call up the head customers' man of a large brokerage house．At times he goes even further and calls up one of the I junior partners of the firm．He will say something like this：

“Say，old man，I want to show you that I appreciate what you have done for me at various times．I am going to give you a chance to make some real money．We are forming a new company to absorb the assets of one of our companies and we'll take over that stock at a big advance over present quotations．I'm going to send in to you 500 shares of Bantam Shops at $65．The stock is now quoted at 72．”

The grateful insider tells the thing to a dozen of the headmen in various big brokerage houses．Now since these recipients of the insider's bounty are in Wall Street what are they going to do when they get that stock that already shows them a profit？Of course，advise every man and woman they can reach to buy that stock．The kind donor knew this．They will help to create a market in which the kind insider can sell his good things at high prices to the poor public．

There are other devices of stock-selling promoters that should be barred．The Exchanges should not allow trading in listed stocks that are offered outside to the public on the partial payment plan．To have the price officially quoted gives a sort of sanction to any stock．Moreover，the official evidence of a free market，and at times the difference in prices，is all the inducement needed．

Another common selling device that costs the unthinking public many millions of dollars and sends nobody to jail because it is perfectly legal，is that of increasing the capital stock exclusively by reason of market exigencies．The process does not really amount to much more than changing the color of the stock certificates．

The juggling whereby 2 or 4 or even 10 shares of new stock are given in exchange for one of the old，is usually prompted by a desire to make the old merchandise more easily vendible．The old price was $t per pound package and hard to move．At 25 cents for a quarter-pound box it might go better；and perhaps at 27 or 30 cents．

Why does not the public ask why the stock is made easy to buy？It is a case of the Wall Street philanthropist operating again，but the wise trader bewares of the Greeks bearing gifts．It is all the warning needed．The public disregards it and loses millions of dollars annually．

The law punishes whoever originates or circulates rumors calculated to affect adversely the credit or business of individuals or corporations，that is，that tend to depress the values of securities by influencing the public to sell．Originally，the chief intention may have been to reduce the danger of panic by punishing anyone who doubted aloud the solvency of banks in times of stress．But of course，it serves also to protect the public against selling stocks below their real value．In other words the law of the land punishes the disseminator of bearish items of that nature．

How is the public protected against the danger of buying stocks above their real value？Who punishes the distributor of unjustified bullish news items？Nobody；and yet，the public loses more money buying stocks on anonymous inside advice when they are too high than it does selling out stocks below their value as a consequence of bearish advice during socalled“raids．”

If a law were passed that would punish bull liars as the law now punishes bear liars，I believe the public would save millions．

Naturally，promoters，manipulators and other beneficiaries of anonymous optimism will tell you that anyone who trades on rumors and unsigned statements has only himself to blame for his losses．One might as well argue that any one who is silly enough to be a drug addict is not entitled to protection．

The Stock Exchange should help．It is vitally interested in protecting the public against unfair practices．If a man in position to know wishes to make the public accept his statements of fact or even his opinions，let him sign his name．Signing bullish items would not necessarily make them true．But it would make the“insiders”and“directors”more careful．

The public ought always to keep in mind the elementals of stock trading．When a stock is going up no elaborate explanation is needed as to why it is going up．It takes continuous buying to make a stock keep on going up．As long as it does so，with only small and natural reactions from time to time，it is a pretty safe proposition to trail along with it．But if after a long steady rise a stock turns and gradually begins to go down，with only occasional small rallies，it is obvious that the line of least resistance has changed from upward to downward．Such being the case why should any one ask for explanations？There are probably very good reasons why it should go down，but these reasons are known only to a few people who either keep those reasons to themselves，or else actually tell the public that the stock is cheap．The nature of the game as it is played is such that the public should realise that the truth cannot be told by the few who know．

Many of the so-called statements attributed to“insiders”or officials have no basis in fact．Sometimes the insiders are not even asked to make a statement，anonymous or signed．These stories are invented by somebody or other who has a large interest in the market．At a certain stage of an advance in the market-price of a security the big insiders are not averse to getting the help of the professional element to trade in that，stock．But while the insider might tell the big plunger the right time to buy，you can bet he will never tell when is the time to sell．That puts the big professional in the same position as the public，only he has to have a market big enough for him to get out on．Then is when you get the most misleading“information．”Of course，there are certain insiders who cannot be trusted at any stage of the game．As a rule the men who are at the head of big corporations may act in the market upon their inside knowledge，but they don't actually tell lies．They merely say nothing，for they have discovered that there are times when silence is golden．

I have said many times and cannot say it too often that the experience of years as a stock operator has convinced me that no man can consistently and continuously beat the stock market though he may make money in individual stocks on certain occasions．No matter how experienced a trader is the possibility of his making losing plays is always present because speculation cannot be made 100 per cent safe．Wall Street professionals know that acting on“inside”tips will break a man more quickly than famine，pestilence，crop failures，political readjustments or what might be called normal accidents．There is no asphalt boulevard to success in Wall Street or anywhere else．Why additionally block traffic？

THE END
