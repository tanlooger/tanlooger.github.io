我要对你们讲一点小约翰。我的故事，那韵调好像一篇童话，然而一切全是曾经实现的。设使你们不再相信了，你们就无须看下去，因为那就是我并非为你们而作。倘或你们遇见小约翰了，你们对他也不可提起那件事，因为这使他痛苦，而且我便要后悔向你们讲说这一切了。

约翰住在有大花园的一所老房子里。那里面是很不容易明白的，因为那房子里是许多黑暗的路、扶梯、小屋子，还有一个很大的仓库，花园里又到处是保护墙和温室。这在约翰就是全世界。他在那里面能够作长远的散步，凡他所发见的，他就给与一个名字。为了房间，他所发明的名字是出于动物界的：毛虫库，因为他在那里养过虫；鸡小房，因为他在那里寻着过一只母鸡。但这母鸡却并非自己跑去的，倒是约翰的母亲关在那里使它孵卵的。为了园，他从植物界里选出名字来，特别着重的，是于他紧要的出产。他就区别为一个复盆子山、一个梨树林、一个地莓谷。园的最后面是一块小地方，就是他所称为天堂的，那自然是美观的罗。那里有一片浩大的水，是一个池，其中浮生着白色的睡莲，芦苇和风也常在那里絮语。那一边站着几个沙冈。这天堂原是一块小草地，在岸的这一边，由丛莽环绕，野凯白勒茂盛地生在那中间。约翰在那里，常常躺在高大的草中，从波动的芦苇叶间，向着水那边的冈上眺望。当炎热的夏天的晚上，他是总在那里的，并且凝视许多时光，自己并不觉得厌倦。他想着又静又清的水的深处，在那奇特的夕照中的水草之间，有多么太平；他于是又想着远的，浮在冈上的，光怪陆离地着了色的云彩——那后面是怎样的呢，那地方是否好看呢，倘能够飞到那里去。太阳一落，这些云彩就堆积到这么高，至于像一所洞府的进口，在洞府的深处还照出一种淡红的光来。这正是约翰所期望的。“我能够飞到那里去么！”他想。“那后面是怎样的呢？我将来真，真能够到那里去么？”

他虽然时常这样地想望，但这洞府总是散作浓浓淡淡的小云片，他到底也没有能够靠近它一点。于是池边就寒冷起来，潮湿起来了，他又得去访问老屋子里的他的昏暗的小屋子。

他在那里住得并不十分寂寞。他有一个父亲，是好好地抚养他的；一只狗，名叫普烈斯多；一只猫，叫西蒙。他自然最爱他的父亲，然而普烈斯多和西蒙在他的估量上却并不这么很低下，像在成人的那样。他还相信普烈斯多比他的父亲更有很多的秘密，对于西蒙，他是怀着极深的敬畏的。但这也不足为奇！西蒙是一匹大的猫，有着光亮乌黑的皮毛，还有粗尾巴。人们可以看出，它颇自负它自己的伟大和聪明。在它的景况中，它总能保持它的成算和尊严，即使它自己屈尊，和一个打滚的木塞子游嬉，或者在树后面吞下一个遗弃的沙定鱼头去。当普烈斯多不驯良的胡闹的时候，它便用碧绿的眼睛轻蔑地瞋视它，并且想：哈哈，这呆畜生此外不再懂得什么了。

约翰对它怀着敬畏的事，你们现在懂得了么？和这小小的棕色的普烈斯多，他却交际得极其情投意合。它并非美丽或高贵的，然而是一匹出格的诚恳而明白的动物，人总不能使它和约翰离开两步，而且它于它主人的讲话是耐心地谨听的。我很难于告诉你们，约翰怎样地挚爱这普烈斯多。但在他的心里，却还剩着许多空间，为别的物事。他的带着小玻璃窗的昏暗的小房间，在那里也占着一个重要的位置，你们觉得奇怪罢？他爱那地毯，那带着大的花纹的，在那里面他认得脸面，还有它的形式，他也察看过许多回——如果他生了病，或者早晨醒了躺在床上的时候。他爱那惟一的挂在那里的小画，上面是做出不动的游人，在尤其不动的园中散步，顺着平滑的池边，那里面喷出齐天的喷泉，还有媚人的天鹅正在游泳。然而他最爱的是时钟。他总以极大的谨慎去开它。倘若它敲起来了，就看它，以为这算是隆重的责任。但这自然只限于约翰还未睡去的时候。假使这钟因为他的疏忽而停住了，约翰就觉得很抱歉，他于是千百次的请他宽容。你们大概是要笑的，倘你们听到了他和他的钟或他的房间在谈话。然而留心罢，你们和你们自己怎样地时常谈话呵。这在你们全不以为可笑。此外约翰还相信，他的对手是完全懂得的，而且并不要求回答。虽然如此，他暗地里也还偶尔等候着钟或地毯的回音。

约翰在学校里虽然还有伙伴，但这却并非朋友。在校内他和他们玩耍和合伙，在外面还结成强盗团(1)——然而只有单和普烈斯多在一起，他才觉得实在的舒服。于是他不愿意孩子们走近，自己觉得完全的自在和平安。

他的父亲是一个智慧的、恳切的人，时常带着约翰向远处游行，经过树林和冈阜。他们就不很交谈，约翰跟在他的父亲的十步之后，遇见花朵，他便问安，并且友爱地用了小手，抚摩那永远不移的老树，在粗糙的皮质上。于是这好意的巨物们便在瑟瑟作响中向他表示它们的感谢。

在途中，父亲时常在沙土上写字母，一个又一个，约翰就拼出它们所造成的字来——父亲也时常站定，并且教给约翰一个植物或动物的名字。

约翰也时常发问，因为他看见和听到许多谜。呆问题是常有的。他问，何以世界是这样，像现在似的，何以动物和植物都得死，还有奇迹是否也能出现。然而约翰的父亲是智慧的人，他并不都说出他所知道的一切。这于约翰是好的。

晚上，当他躺下睡觉之前，约翰总要说一篇长长的祷告。这是管理孩子的姑娘这样教他的。他为他父亲和普烈斯多祷告。西蒙用不着这样，他想。他也为他自己祷告得很长，临末，几乎永是发生那个希望，将来总会有奇迹出现的。他说过“亚门”之后，便满怀期望地在半暗的屋子中环视，到那在轻微的黄昏里，比平时显得更奇特的地毯上的花纹，到门的把手，到时钟，从那里是很可以出现奇迹的。但那钟总是这么滴嗒滴嗒地走，把手是不动的。天全暗了，约翰也酣睡了，没有奇迹出现。然而总有一次得出现的，这他知道。

池边是闷热和死静。太阳因为白天的工作，显得通红而疲倦了，当未落以前，暂时在远处的冈头休息。光滑的水面，几乎全映出它炽烈的面貌来。垂在池上的山毛榉树的叶子，趁着平静，在镜中留神地端相着自己。孤寂的苍鹭，那用一足站在睡莲的阔叶之间的，也忘却了它曾经出去捉过虾蟆，只沉在遐想中凝视着前面。

这时约翰来到草地上了，为的是看看云彩的洞府。扑通，扑通！虾蟆从岸上跳下去了。水镜起了波纹，太阳的象裂成宽阔的绦带，山毛榉树的叶子也不高兴地颤动，因为他的观察还没有完。

山毛榉树的露出的根上系着一只旧的、小小的船。约翰自己上去坐，是被严厉地禁止的。唉！今晚的诱惑是多么强呵！云彩已经造成一个很大的门，太阳一定是要到那后面去安息。辉煌的小云排列成行，像一队全甲的卫士。水面也发出光闪，红的火星在芦苇间飞射，箭也似的。

约翰慢慢地从山毛榉树的根上解开船缆来。浮到那里去，那光怪陆离的中间！普烈斯多当它的主人还未准备之先，已经跳上船去了，芦苇的干子便分头弯曲，将他们俩徐徐赶出，到那用了它最末的光照射着他们的夕阳那里去。

约翰倚在前舱，观览那光的洞府的深处——“翅子！”他想，“现在，翅子，往那边去！”——太阳消失了。云彩还在发光。东方的天作深蓝色。柳树沿着岸站立成行。它们不动地将那狭的、白色的叶子伸在空气里。这垂着，由暗色的后面的衬托，如同华美的浅绿的花边。

静着！这是什么呢？水面上像是起了一个吹动——像是将水劈成一道深沟的微风的一触。这是来自沙冈，来自云的洞府的。

当约翰四顾的时候，船沿上坐着一个大的蓝色的水蜻蜓。这么大的一个是他向来没有见过的。它安静地坐着，但它的翅子抖成一个大的圈。这在约翰，似乎它的翅子的尖端形成了一枚发光的戒指。

“这是一个蛾儿罢，”他想，“这是很少见的。”

指环只是增大起来，它的翅子又抖得这样快，至使约翰只能看见一片雾。而且慢慢地觉得它，仿佛从雾中亮出两个漆黑的眼睛来，并且一个娇小的、苗条的身躯，穿着浅蓝的衣裳，坐在大蜻蜓的处所。白的旋花的冠戴在金黄的头发上，肩旁还垂着透明的翅子，肥皂泡似的千色地发光。约翰战栗了。这是一个奇迹！

“你要做我的朋友么？”他低声说。

对生客讲话，这虽是一种异样的仪节，但此地一切是全不寻常的。他又觉得，似乎这陌生的蓝东西在他是早就熟识的了。

“是的，约翰！”他这样地听到，那声音如芦苇在晚风中作响，或是淅沥地洒在树林的叶上的雨声。

“我怎样称呼你呢？”约翰问道。

“我生在一朵旋花的花托里，叫我旋儿罢！”

旋儿微笑着，并且很相信地看着约翰的眼睛，致使他心情觉得异样地安乐。

“今天是我的生日，”旋儿说，“我就生在这处所，从月亮的最初的光线和太阳的最末的。人说，太阳是女性的，但他并不是，他是我的父亲！”

约翰便慨诺，明天在学校里去说太阳是男性的。

“看哪！母亲的圆圆的白的脸已经出来了。——谢天，母亲！唉！不，她怎么又晦暗了呢！”

旋儿指着东方。在灰色的天际，在柳树的暗黑地垂在晴明的空中的尖叶之后，月亮大而灿烂地上升，并且装着一副很不高兴的脸。

“唉，唉，母亲！——这不要紧。我能够相信他！”

那美丽的东西高兴地颤动着翅子，还用他捏在手里的燕子花来打约翰，轻轻地在面庞上。

“我到你这里来，在她是不以为然的。你是第一个。但我相信你，约翰。你永不可在谁的面前提起我的名字，或者讲说我。你允许么？”

“可以，旋儿。”约翰说。这一切于他还很生疏。他感到莫可名言的幸福，然而怕，他的幸福是笑话。他做梦么？靠近他在船沿上躺着普烈斯多，安静地睡着。他的小狗的温暖的呼吸使他宁帖。蚊虻们盘旋水面上，并且在菩提树空气中跳舞，也如平日一般。周围的一切都这样清楚而且分明。这应该是真实的。他又总觉得旋儿的深信的眼光，怎样地停留在他这里。于是那腴润的声音又发响了：

“我时常在这里看见你，约翰。你知道我在什么地方么？——我大抵坐在池的沙地上，繁密的水草之间，而且仰视你，当你为了喝水或者来看水甲虫和鲵鱼，在水上弯腰的时候。然而你永是看不见我。我也往往从茂密的芦苇中窥见你。我是常在那里的。天一热，我总在那里睡觉，在一个空的鸟巢中。是呵，这是很柔软的。”

旋儿高兴地在船沿上摇晃，还用他的花去扑飞蚊。

“现在我要和你作一个小聚会。你平常的生活是这么简单。我们要做好朋友，我还要讲给你许多事，比学校教师给你捆上去的好得多。他们什么都不知道。我有好得远远的来源，比书本子好得远。你倘若不信我，我就教你自己去看，去听去。我要携带你。”

“阿，旋儿，爱的旋儿！你能带我往那里去么？”约翰嚷着，一面指着那边，是落日的紫光正在黄金的云门里放光的处所。——这华美的巨象已经怕要散作苍黄的烟雾了。但从最深处，总还是冲出淡红的光来。

旋儿凝视着那光，那将他美丽的脸和他的金黄的头发镀上金色的，并且慢慢地摇头。

“现在不！现在不，约翰。你不可立刻要求得太多。我自己就从来没有到过父亲那里哩。”

“我是总在我的父亲那里的。”约翰说。

“不！那不是你的父亲。我们是弟兄，我的父亲也是你的。但你的母亲是地，我们因此就很各别了。你又生在一个家庭里，在人类中，而我是在一朵旋花的花托上。这自然是好得多。然而我们仍然能够很谅解。”

于是旋儿轻轻一跳，到了在轻装之下毫不摇动的船的那边，一吻约翰的额。

但这于约翰是一种奇特的感觉。这时，似乎周围一切完全改变了。他觉得，这时他看得一切都更好、更分明。他看见，月亮现在怎样更加友爱地向他看；他又看见，睡莲怎样地有着面目，这都在诧异地沉思地观察他。现在他顿然懂得，蚊虻们为什么这样欢乐地上下跳舞，总是互相环绕，高高低低，直到它们用它们的长腿触着水面。他于此早就仔细地思量过，但这时却自然懂得了。

他又听得，芦苇絮语些什么，岸边的树木如何低声叹息，说是太阳下去了。

“阿，旋儿！我感谢你，这确是可观。是的，我们将要很了解了。”

“将你的手交给我。”旋儿说，一面展开彩色的翅子来。他于是拉着船里的约翰，经过了在月光下发亮的水蔷薇的叶子，走到水上去。

处处有一匹虾蟆坐在叶子上。但这时它已不像约翰来的时候似的跳下水去了。它只向他略略鞠躬，并且说：“阁阁！”约翰也用了同等的鞠躬，回报这敬礼。他毫不愿意显出一点傲慢来。

于是他们到了芦苇旁——这很广阔，他们还未到岸的时候，全船就隐没在那里面了。但约翰却紧牵着他的同伴，他们就从高大的干子之间爬到陆地上。

约翰很明白，他变为很小而轻了，然而这大概不过是想象。他能够在一枝芦干上爬上去，他却是未曾想到的。

“留神罢，”旋儿说，“你就要看见好看的事了。”

他们在偶然透过几条明亮的月光的、昏暗的丛莽之下，穿着丰草前行。

“你晚上曾在冈子上听到过蟋蟀么，约翰？是不是呢，它们像是在合奏，而你总不能听出，那声音是从什么地方来的。唔，它们唱，并非为了快乐，你所听到的那声音，是来自蟋蟀学校的，成百的蟋蟀们就在那里练习它们的功课。静静的罢，我们就要到了。”

嘶尔尔！嘶尔尔！

丛莽露出光来了，当旋儿用花推开草茎的时候，约翰看见一片明亮的、开阔的地面，小蟋蟀们就在那里做着那些事，在薄的、狭的冈草上练习它们的功课。

嘶尔尔！嘶尔尔！

一个大的，肥胖的蟋蟀是教员，监视着学课。学生们一个跟着一个的，向它跳过去，总是一跳就到，又一跳回到原地方。有谁跳错了，便该站在地菌上受罚。

“好好地听着罢，约翰！你也许能在这里学一点。”旋儿说。

蟋蟀怎样地回答，约翰很懂得。但那和教员在学校里的讲说，是全不相同的。最先是地理。它们不知道世界的各部分。它们只要熟悉二十六个沙冈和两个池。凡有较远的，就没有人能够知道一点点。那教师说，凡讲起这些的，不过是一种幻想罢了。

这回轮到植物学了。它们于此都学得不错，并且分给了许多奖赏：各样长的、特别嫩的、脆的草干子。但约翰最为惊奇的是动物学。动物被区分为跳的、飞的和爬的。蟋蟀能够跳和飞，就站在最高位，其次是虾蟆。鸟类被它们用了种种愤激的表示，说成最大的祸害和危险。最末也讲到人类。那是一种大的、无用而有害的动物，是站在进化的很低的阶级上的，因为这既不能跳，也不能飞，但幸而还少见。一个小蟋蟀，还没有见过一个人，误将人类数在无害的动物里面了，就得了草干子的三下责打。

约翰从来没有听到过这等事！

教师忽然高呼道：“静着！练跳！”

一切蟋蟀们便立刻停了学习，很敏捷很勤快地翻起筋斗来。胖教员带领着。

这是很滑稽的美观，致使约翰愉快得拍手。它们一听到，全校便骤然在冈上迸散，草地上也即成了死静了。

“唉，这是你呀，约翰！你举动不要这么粗蛮！大家会看出，你是生在人类中的。”

“我很难过，下回我要好好地留心，但那也实在太滑稽了。”

“滑稽的还多哩。”旋儿说。

他们经过草地，就从那一边走到冈上。呸！这是厚的沙土里面的工作！——但待到约翰抓住旋儿的透明的蓝衣，他便轻易地、迅速地飞上去了。冈头的中途是一匹野兔的窠。在那里住家的兔子，用头和爪躺在洞口，以享受这佳美的夜气。冈蔷薇还在蓓蕾，而它那细腻的、娇柔的香气，是混和着生在冈上的麝香草的花香。

约翰常看见野兔躲进它的洞里去，一面就自己问：“那里面是什么情形呢？能有多少聚在那里呢？它们不担心么？”

待到他听见他的同伴在问野兔，是否可以参观一回洞穴，他就非常高兴了。

“在我是可以的，”那兔说，“但适值不凑巧，我今晚正把我的洞穴交出，去开一个慈善事业的典礼了，因此在自己的家里便并不是主人。”

“哦，哦，是出了不幸的事么？”

“唉，是呵！”野兔伤感地说，“一个大大的打击，我们要几年痛不完。从这里一千跳之外，造起一所人类的住所来了。这么大，这么大！——人们便搬到那里去了，带着狗。我家的七个分子，就在那里被祸，而无家可归的还有三倍之多。于老鼠这一伙和土拨鼠的家属尤为不利。癞虾蟆也大受侵害了。于是我们便为着遗族们开一个会，各人能什么，他就做什么。我是交出我的洞来。大家总该给它们的同类留下一点什么的。”

富于同情的野兔叹息着，并且用它的右前爪将长耳朵从头上拉过来，来拭干一滴泪。这样的是它的手巾。

冈草里索索地响起来，一个肥胖的、笨重的身躯来到洞穴。

“看哪！”旋儿大声说，“硕鼠伯伯来了。”

那硕鼠并不留心旋儿的话，将一枝用干叶包好的整谷穗，安详地放在洞口，就灵敏地跳过野兔的脊梁，进洞去了。

“我们可以进去么？”实在好奇的约翰问，“我也愿意捐一点东西。”

他记得衣袋里还有一个饼干。当他拿了出来时，这才确实觉到，他变得怎样地小了。他用了两只手才能将这捧起来，还诧异在他的衣袋里怎么会容得下。

“这是很少见，很宝贵的！”野兔嚷着，“好阔绰的礼物！”

它十分恭敬地允许两个进门。洞里很黑暗，约翰愿意使旋儿在前面走。但即刻他们看见一点淡绿的小光，向他们近来了。这是一个火萤，为要使他们满意，来照他们的。

“今天晚上看来是要极其漂亮的，”火萤前导着说，“这里早有许多来客了。我觉得你们是妖精，对不对？”那火萤一面看定了约翰，有些怀疑。

“你将我们当作妖精去禀报就是了。”旋儿回答说。

“你们可知道，你们的王也在赴会么？”火萤接着道。

“上首在这里么？这使我非常喜欢！”旋儿大声说，“我本身和他认识的。”

“阿呀！”火萤说，“我不知道我有光荣。”因为惊讶，它的小光几乎消灭了。“是呵，陛下平时最爱的是自由空气，但为了慈善的目的，他倒是什么都可以的。这要成为一个很有光彩的会罢。”

那也的确。鬼子建筑里的大堂，是辉煌地装饰了。地面踏得很坚实，还撒上含香的麝香草；进口的前面用后脚斜挂着一只蝙蝠；它禀报来客，同时又当着帘幕的差。这是一种节省的办法。大堂的墙上都用了枯叶、蛛网以及小小的、挂着的小蝙蝠极有趣致地装璜着。无数的火萤往来其间，还在顶上盘旋，造成一个动心的活动的照耀。大堂上面是朽烂的树干所做的宝座，放着光，弄出金刚石一般的结果来。这是一个辉煌的情景！

早有了许多来客了。约翰在这生疏的环境中，觉得只像在家里的一半，惟有紧紧地靠着旋儿。他看见稀奇的东西。一匹土拨鼠极有兴会地和野鼠议论着美观的灯和装饰。一个角落里坐着两个肥胖的癞虾蟆，还摇着头诉说长久的旱天。一个虾蟆想挽着手引一个蝎虎穿过大堂去，这于它很为难，因为它是略有些神经兴奋和躁急的，所以它每一回总将墙上的装饰弄得非常凌乱了。

宝座上坐着上首，妖的王，围绕着一小群妖精的侍从，有几个轻蔑地俯视着周围。王本身是照着王模样，出格地和蔼，并且和各种来客亲睦地交谈。他是从东方旅行来的，穿一件奇特的衣服，用美观的、各色的花叶制成。这里并不生长这样的花，约翰想。他头上戴一个深蓝的花托，散出新鲜的香气，像新折一般。在手里他拿着莲花的一条花须，当作御杖。

一切与会的都受着他的恩泽。他称赞这里的月光，还说，本地的火萤也美丽，几乎和东方的飞萤相同。他又很合意地看了墙上的装饰，一个土拨鼠还看出陛下曾经休憩，惬意地点着头。

“同我走，”旋儿对约翰说，“我要引见你。”于是他们直冲到王的座前。

上首一认出旋儿，便高兴地伸开两臂，并且和他接吻。这在宾客之间搅起了私语，妖精的侍从中是嫉妒的眼光。那在角落里的两个肥胖的癞虾蟆，絮说些“谄媚者”、“乞怜者”和“不会长久的”，而且别有用意地点头。旋儿和上首谈得很久，用了异样的话，于是就将约翰招过去。

“给我手，约翰！”那王说，“旋儿的朋友就是我的朋友。凡我能够的，我都愿意帮助你。我要给你我们这一党的表记。”

上首从他的项链上解下一个小小的金的锁匙来，递给约翰。他十分恭敬地接受了，紧紧地捏在手里。

“这匙儿能是你的幸福，”王接着说，“这能开一个金的小箱，藏些高贵的至宝的。然而谁有这箱，我却不能告诉你。你只要热心地寻求。倘使你和我和旋儿长做好朋友而且忠实，那于你就要成功了。”

妖王于是和蔼地点着他美丽的头，约翰喜出望外地向他致谢。

坐在湿的莓苔的略高处的三个虾蟆，联成慢圆舞的领导，对偶也配搭起来了。有谁不跳舞，便被一个绿色的蜥蜴，这是充当司仪，并且奔忙于职务的，推到旁边去，那两个癞虾蟆就大烦恼，一齐诉苦，说它们不能看见了。这时跳舞已经开头。

但这确是可笑！各个都用了它的本相跳舞，并且自然地摆出那一种态度，以为它所做的比别个好得多。老鼠和虾蟆站起后脚高高地跳着，一个年老的硕鼠旋得如此粗野，使所有跳舞者都从它的前面躲向旁边，还有一匹惟一的肥胖的树蜗牛，敢于和土拨鼠来转一圈，但不久便被抛弃了，在前墙之下，以致她（译者按：蜗牛）因此得了腰胁痛，那实在的原因，倒是因为她不很懂得那些事。

然而一切都做得很诚实而庄严。大家很有几分将这些看作荣耀，并且惴惴地窥伺王，想在他的脸上看出一点赞赏的表示。王却怕惹起不满，只是凝视着前方。他的侍从人等，那看重它们的技艺的品格，来参与跳舞的，是高傲地旁观着。

约翰熬得很久了。待到他看见，一匹大的蜥蜴怎样地抡着一个小小的癞虾蟆，时常将这可怜的癞虾蟆从地面高高举起，并且在空中抡一个半圆，便在响亮的哄笑里，发泄出他的兴致来了。

这惹起了一个激动。音乐喑哑了。王严厉地四顾。司仪员向笑者飞奔过去，并且严重地申斥他，举动须要合礼。

“跳舞是一件最庄重的事，”它说，“毫没有什么可笑的。这里是一个高尚的集会，大家在这里跳舞并非单为了游戏。各显各的特长，没有一个会希望被笑的。这是大不敬。除此之外，大家在这里是一个悲哀的仪节，为了重大的原因。在这里举动务须合礼，也不要做在人类里面似的事！”

这使约翰害怕起来了。他到处看见仇视的眼光。他和王的亲密给他招了许多的仇敌。旋儿将他拉在旁边：

“我们还是走的好罢，约翰！”他低声说，“你将这又闹坏了。是呵，是呵，如果从人类中教育出来的，就那样！”

他们慌忙从蝙蝠门房的翅子下潜行，走到黑暗的路上。恭敬的火萤等着他们。“你们好好地行乐了么？”它问，“你们和上首大王扳谈了么？”

“唉，是的！那是一个有趣的会，”约翰说，“你必须永站在这暗路上么？”

“这是本身的自由的选择，”火萤用了悲苦的声音说，“我再不能参与这样无聊的集会了。”

“去罢！”旋儿说，“你并不这样想。”

“然而这是实情。早先——早先有一时，我也曾参与过各种的会，跳舞，徘徊。但现在我是被忧愁扫荡了，现在……”它还这样的激动，至于消失了它的光。

幸而他们已近洞口，野兔听得他们临近，略向旁边一躲，放进月光来。

他们一到外面野兔的旁边，约翰说：“那么，就给我讲你的故事罢，火萤！”

“唉！”火萤叹息，“这事是简单而且悲伤。这不使你们高兴。”

“讲罢，讲它就是！”大家都嚷起来。

“那么，你们都知道，我们火萤是极其异乎寻常的东西。是呵，我觉得，谁也不能否认，我们火萤是一切生物中最有天禀的。”

“何以呢？这我却愿意知道。”野兔说。

火萤渺视地回答道：“你们能发光么？”

“不，这正不然。”野兔只得赞成。

“那么，我们发光，我们大家！我们还能够随意发光或者熄灭。光是最高的天赋，而一个生物能发最高的光。还有谁要和我们竞争前列么？我们男的此外还有翅子，并且能够飞到几里远。”

“这我也不能。”野兔谦逊地自白。

“就因为我们有发光的天赋，”火萤接着说，“别的动物也哀矜我们，没有鸟来攻击我们。只有一种动物，是一切中最低级的那个，搜寻我们，还捉了我们去。那就是人，是造物的最蛮横的出产。”

说到这里，约翰注视着旋儿，似乎不懂它。旋儿只微笑，并且示意他，教他不开口。

“有一回，我也往来飞翔，一个明亮的迷光，高兴地在黑暗的丛莽里，在寂寞的潮湿的草上，在沟的岸边。这里生活着她，她的存在，和我的幸福是分不开的。她华美地在蓝的碧玉光中灿烂着，当她顺着草爬行的时候，很强烈地蛊惑了我的少年的心。我绕着她飞翔，还竭力用了颜色的变换来牵引她的注意。幸而我看出，她已经怎样地收受了我的敬礼，腼腆地将她的光儿韬晦了。因为感动而发着抖，我知道收敛起我的翅子，降到我的爱者那里去，其时正有一种强大的声响弥满着空中。暗黑的形体近来了。那是人类。我骇怕得奔逃。他们追赶我，还用一种沉重的、乌黑的东西照着我打。但我的翅子担着我是比他们的笨重的腿要快一点的。待到我回来的时候……”

讲故事的至此停止说话了。先是寂静的刺激一刹那——这时三个听的都惴惴地沉默着——它才接着说：

“你们早经料到了。我的娇嫩的未婚妻——一切中最灿烂和最光明的——她是消失了，给恶意的人们捉去了。闲静的、潮湿的小草地是踏坏了，而她那在沟沿的心爱的住所是惨淡和荒凉。我在世界上是孤独了。”

多感的野兔仍旧拉过耳朵来，从眼里拭去一滴泪。

“从此以后我就改变了。一切轻浮的娱乐我都反对。我只记得我所失掉的她，还想着我和她再会的时候。”

“这样么？你还有这样的希望么？”野兔高兴地问。

“比希望还要切实，我有把握的。在那上面我将再会我的爱者。”

“然而……”野兔想反驳。

“兔儿，”火萤严肃地说，“我知道，只有应该在昏暗里彷徨的，才会怀疑。然而如果是看得见的，如果是用自己的眼来看的，那就凡有不确的事于我是一个疑案。那边！”光虫说，并且敬畏地仰看着种满星星的天空，“我在那边看见她！一切我的祖先，一切我的朋友，以及她，我看见较之在这地上，更其分明地发着威严的光辉。唉唉，什么时候我才能蓦地离于这空虚的生活，飞到那诱引着招致我的她那里去呢？唉唉！什么时候，什么时候……？”

光虫叹息着，离开它的听者，又爬进黑暗的洞里去了。

“可怜的东西！”野兔说，“我盼望，它不错。”

“我也盼望。”约翰赞同着。

“我以为未必，”旋儿说，“然而那倒很动人。”

“爱的旋儿，”约翰说，“我很疲倦，也要睡了。”

“那么来罢，你躺在这里我的旁边，我要用我的氅衣盖着你。”

旋儿取了他的蓝色的小氅衣，盖了约翰和自己。他们就这样躺在冈坡的发香的草上，彼此紧紧地拥抱着。

“你们将头放得这么平，”野兔大声说，“你们愿意枕着我么？”这一个贡献他们不能拒绝。

“好晚上，母亲。”旋儿对月亮说。

于是约翰将金的小锁匙紧握在手中，将头靠在好心的野兔的蒙茸的毛上，静静地酣睡了。

他在那里呢，普烈斯多？——你的小主人在那里呢？——在船上，在芦苇间醒来的时候，怎样地吃惊呵——只剩了自己——主人是无踪无影地消失了。这可教人担心和害怕——你现在已经奔波得很久，并且不住地奋亢的呜呜着寻觅他罢？——可怜的普烈斯多。你怎么也能睡得这样熟，且不留心你的主人离了船呢？平常是只要他一动，你就醒了的。你平常这样灵敏的鼻子，今天不为你所用了。你几乎辨不出主人从那里上岸，在这沙冈上也完全失掉了踪迹。你的热心的齅也不帮助你。唉，这绝望！主人去了！无踪无影地去了！——那么，寻罢，普烈斯多，寻他罢！且住，正在你前面，在冈坡上——那边不是躺着一点小小的、暗黑的东西么？你好好地看一看罢！

那小狗屹立着倾听了一些时，并且凝视着远处。于是它忽然抬起头来，用了它四条细腿的全力，跑向冈坡上的暗黑的小点那里去了。

一寻到，却确是那苦痛的失踪的小主人，于是它尽力设法，表出它的一切高兴和感谢来，似乎还不够。它摇尾，跳跃，呜呜吠叫，并且向多时寻觅的人齅着，舐着，将冷鼻子搁在脸面上。

“静静的罢，普烈斯多，到你的窠里去！”约翰在半睡中大声说。

主人有多么胡涂呵！凡是望得见的地方，没有一个窠在近处。

小小的睡眠者的精神逐渐清楚起来了。普烈斯多的齅——这是他每天早晨习惯了的。但在他的灵魂之前，还挂着妖精和月光的轻微的梦影，正如丘冈景色上的晓雾一般。他生怕清晨的凉快的呼吸会将这些驱走。“合上眼睛，”他想，“要不然，我又将看见时钟和地毯，像平日似的。”

但他也躺得很异样。他觉得他没有被。慢慢地他小心着将眼睛睁开了一线。

明亮的光！蓝的天！云！

于是约翰睁大了眼睛，并且说：“那是真的么？”是呀！他躺在冈的中间。清朗的日光温暖他；他吸进新鲜的朝气去，在他的眼前还有一层薄雾环绕着远处的山林。他只看见池边的高的山毛榉树和自家的屋顶伸出在丛碧的上面。蜜蜂和甲虫绕着他飞鸣；头上唱着高飞的云雀，远处传来犬吠和远隔的城市的喧嚣。这些都是纯粹的事实。

然而他曾经梦见了什么还是没有什么呢？旋儿在那里呢？还有那野兔？

两个他都不见。只有普烈斯多坐在他身边，久候了似的摇着尾巴向他看。

“我真成了梦游者了么？”约翰自己问。

他的近旁是一个兔窟。这在冈上倒是常有的。他站起来，要去看它个仔细。在他紧握的手里他觉得什么呢？

他摊开手，他从脊骨到脚跟都震悚了。是灿烂着一个小小的、黄金的锁匙。他默默地坐了许多时。

“普烈斯多！”他于是说，几乎要哭出来，“普烈斯多，这也还是实在的！”

普烈斯多一跃而起，试用吠叫来指示它的主人，它饥饿了，它要回家去。

回家么？是的，约翰没有想到这一层，他于此也很少挂念。但他即刻听到几种声音叫着他的名字了。他便明白，他的举动，大家是全不能当作驯良和规矩的，他还须等候那很不和气的话。

只一刹时，高兴的眼泪化为恐怖和后悔的眼泪了。但他就想着现是他的朋友和心腹的旋儿，想着妖王的赠品，还想着过去一切的华美的不能否认的真实，他静静地，被诸事羁绊着，向回家的路上走。

那遭际是比他所豫料的还不利。他想不到他的家属有这样地恐怖和不安。他应该郑重地认可，永不再是这么顽皮和大意了。这又给他一个羁绊。“这我不能！”他坚决地说。人们很诧异。他被讯问、恳求、恫吓。但他却只想着旋儿，坚持着。只要能保住旋儿的友情，他怕什么责罚呢——为了旋儿，他有什么不能忍受呢？他将小锁匙紧紧地按在胸前，并且紧闭了嘴唇，每一问，都只用耸肩来作回答。“我不能一定。”他永是说。

但他的父亲却道：“那就不管他罢，这于他太严紧了。他必是遇到了什么出奇的事情。将来总会有讲给我们的时候的。”

约翰微笑，沉默着吃了他的奶油面包，就潜进自己的小屋去。他剪下一段窗幔的绳子，系了那宝贵的锁匙，帖身挂在胸前。于是他放心去上学校了。

这一天他在学校里确是很不行。他做不出他的学课，而且也全不经意。他的思想总是飞向池边和昨夜的奇异的事件去。他几乎想不明白，怎么一个妖王的朋友现在须负做算术和变化动词的义务了。然而这一切都是真实，周围的人们于此谁也不知道，谁也不能够相信或相疑，连那教员都不，虽然他也深刻地瞥着眼，并且也轻蔑地将约翰叫作懒东西。他欣然承受了这不好的品评，还做着惩罚的工作，这是他的疏忽拉给他的。

“他们谁都猜不到。他们要怎样呵斥我，都随意吧。旋儿总是我的朋友，而且旋儿于我，胜过所有他们的全群，连先生都算上。”

约翰这是不大恭敬的。对于他的同胞的敬意，自从他前晚听到议论他们的一切劣点之后，却是没有加增。

当教员讲述着，怎样只有人类是由上帝给与了理性，并且置于一切动物之上，作为主人的时候，他笑起来了。这又给他博得一个不好的品评和严厉的指摘。待到他的邻座者在课本上读着下面的话：“我的任性的叔母的年龄是大的，然而较之太阳，没有伊的那么大。”——约翰便赶快大声地叫道：“他的！”(1)

大家都笑他，连那教员，对于他所说那样的自负的胡涂觉得诧异，教约翰留下，并且写一百回：“我的任性的叔母的年龄是大的，然而较之太阳，没有伊的那么大——较之两个更大的，然而是我的胡涂。”

学生们都去了，约翰孤独地坐在广大的校区里面写。太阳光愉快地映射进来，在它的经过的路上使无数白色的尘埃发闪，还在白涂的墙上形成明亮的点，和时间的代谢慢慢地迁移。教员走了，高声地关了门。当约翰写到第二十五任性的叔母的时候，一匹小小的、敏捷的小鼠，有着乌黑的珠子眼和绸缎似的小耳朵，无声地从班级的最远的角上沿着壁偷偷走来了。约翰一声不响，怕赶走了那有趣的小动物。但这小鼠并不胆怯，径到约翰的座前。它用细小的明亮的眼睛暂时锋利地四顾，便敏捷地一跳，到了椅子上，再一跳就上了约翰在写着字的书桌。

“阿，阿，”他半是自言自语地说，“你倒是一匹勇敢的鼠子。”

“我却也不知道，我须怕谁。”一种微细的声音说，那小鼠还微笑似的露出雪白的小牙。

约翰曾经阅历过许多奇异的事——但这时却还是圆睁了眼睛。这样地在白天而且在学校里——这是不可信的。

“在我这里你无须恐怖，”他低声说，仍然是怕惊吓了那小鼠——“你是从旋儿那里来的么？”

“我正从那里来，来告诉你，那教员完全有理，你的惩罚是恰恰相当的。”

“但是旋儿说的呵，太阳盖是男性，太阳是我们的父亲。”

“是的，然而此外用不着谁知道。这和人类有什么相干呢。你永不必将这么精微的事去对人类讲。他们太粗。人是一种可骇的恶劣和蛮野的东西，只要什么到了他的范围之内，他最喜欢将一切擒拿和蹂躏。这是我们鼠族从经验上识得的。”

“但是，小鼠，你为什么停在他们的四近呢，你为什么不远远地躲到山林里去呢？”

“唉，我们现在不再能够了。我们太惯于都市风味了。如果小心着，并且时时注意，避开他们的捕机和他们的沉重的脚，在人类里也就可以支撑。幸而我们也还算敏捷的。最坏的是人类和猫结了一个联盟，借此来补救他们自己的蠢笨——这是大不幸。但山林里却有枭和鹰，我们会一切都死完。好，约翰，记着我的忠告罢，教员来了！”

“小鼠，小鼠，不要走。问问旋儿，我将我的匙儿怎么办呢？我将这帖胸挂在颈子上。土曜日我要换干净的小衫，我很怕有谁会看见。告诉我罢，我藏在那里最是稳当呢，爱的小鼠。”

“在地里，永久在地里，这是最为稳当的。要我给你收藏起来么？”

“不，不要在这里学校里！”

“那就埋在那边冈子上。我要通知我的表姊，那野鼠去，教她必须留神些。”

“多谢，小鼠。”

蓬，蓬！教员到来了。这时候，约翰正将他的笔尖浸在墨水里，那小鼠是消失了。自己想要回家的教员，就赦免了约翰四十八行字。

两日之久，约翰在不断的忧惧中过活。他受了严重的监视，凡有溜到冈上去的机会，都被剥夺了。已经是金曜日，他还在带着那宝贵的匙儿往来。明天晚上他便须换穿干净的小衫，人会发见这匙儿，而且拿了去——他为了这思想而战栗。家里或园里他都不敢藏：他觉得没有一处是够安稳的。

金曜日的晚上了，黄昏已经闯进来。约翰坐在他卧室的窗前，出神地从园子的碧绿的丛草中眺望着远处的冈阜。

“旋儿！旋儿！帮助我。”他忧闷地絮叨着。

近旁响着一种轻轻的拍翅声，他闻到铃兰的香味，还忽然听得熟识的、甜美的声音。

旋儿靠近他坐在窗沿上，摇动着一枝长梗的铃兰。

“你到底来了！——我是这么渴想你！”约翰说。

“同我走，约翰，我们要埋起你的匙儿。”

“我不能。”约翰惨淡地叹息说。

然而旋儿握了他的手，他便觉得他轻得正如一粒蒲公英的带着羽毛的种子，在静穆的晚天里飘浮而去了。

“旋儿，”约翰飘浮着说，“我这样地爱你。我相信，我能为你放下一切的人们，连普烈斯多！”

旋儿吻他，问道：“连西蒙？”

“阿，我喜欢西蒙与否，这于它不算什么。我想，它以为这是孩子气的。西蒙就只喜欢那卖鱼的女人，而且这也只在它肚饿的时候。从你看来，西蒙是一匹平常的猫么，旋儿？”

“不，它先前是一个人。”

呼——蓬！——一个金虫(2)向约翰撞来了。

“你们不能看清楚一点么，”金虫不平地说，“妖精族纷飞着，好像他们将全部的空气都租去了！会无用到这样，总是单为了自己的快乐飘来飘去——而我辈，尽着自己的义务，永是追求着食物，只要能吃多少，便尽量吃多少的，却被他们赶到路旁去了。”

它呶呶着飞了开去。

“我们不吃，它以为不好么？”约翰问。

“是呵，金虫类是这样的。金虫以为这是它们的最高的义务，大嚼得多。要我给你讲一个幼小的金虫的故事么？”

“好，讲罢，旋儿！”

“曾经有一个好看的幼小的金虫，是刚从地里钻出来的。唔，这是大奇事。它坐在黑暗的地下一整年，等候着第一个温暖的夜晚。待到它从地皮里伸出头来的时候，所有的绿叶和鸣禽都使它非常慌张了。它不知道它究竟应该怎样开手。它用了它的触角，去摸近地的小草茎，并且扇子似的将这伸开去。于是它觉得，它是雄的。它是它种族中的一个美丽的模范，有着灿烂的乌黑的前足，厚积尘埃的后腹，和一个胸甲，镜子似的放光。幸而不久它在近处看见了一个别的金虫，那虽然没有这样美，然而前一天已经飞出，因此确是有了年纪的。因为它这样地年青，它便极其谦恭地去叫那一个。

“‘什么事，朋友？’那一个从上面问，因为它看出这一个是新家伙了，‘你要问我道路么？’

“‘不，请你原谅，’幼小的金虫谦恭地说，‘我先不知道，这里我必须怎样开头。做金虫是应该怎么办的？’

“‘哦，原来，’那一个说，‘那你不知道么？我明白你，我也曾经这样的。好好地听罢，我就要告诉你了。金虫生活的最要义是大嚼。离此不远有一片贵重的菩提树林，那是为我们而种的，将它竭力地勤勉地大嚼，是我们所有的义务。’

“‘谁将这菩提树林安置在那里的呢？’年幼的甲虫问。

“‘阿，一个大东西，是给我们办得很好的。每早晨这就走过树林，有谁大嚼得最多的，这就带它去，到一所华美的屋子里。那屋子是放着清朗的光，一切金虫都在那里幸福地团聚着的。但要是谁不大嚼，反而整夜向各处纷飞的，它就要被蝙蝠捉住了。’

“‘那是谁呢？’新家伙问。

“‘这是一种可怕的怪物，有着锋利的牙，它从我们的后面突然飞来，用残酷的一嘎咭便吃尽了。’

“甲虫正在这么说，它们听得上面有清亮的霍的一声，透了它们的心髓。‘呵，那就是！’长辈大声说，‘你要小心它，青年朋友。感谢罢，恰巧我通知你了。你的前面有一个整夜，不要耽误罢。你吃得越少，祸事就越多，会被蝙蝠吞掉的。只有能够挑选那正经的生活的本分的，才到有着清朗的光的屋子去。记着罢！正经的生活的本分！’

“年纪大了一整天的那甲虫，于是在草梗之间爬开去了，并且将这一个惘然地留下。——你知道么，什么是生活的本分，约翰？不罢？那幼小的甲虫也正不知道。这事和大嚼相连，它是懂得的。然而它须怎样，才可以到那菩提树林呢？

“它近旁竖着一枝瘦长的，有力的草梗，轻轻地在晚风中摇摆。它就用它六条弯曲的腿，很坚牢地抓住它。从下面望去，它觉得仿佛一个高大的巨灵而且很险峻。但那金虫还要往上走。这是生活的本分，它想，并且怯怯地开始了升进。这是缓慢的，它屡次滑回去，然而它向前。当它终于爬到最高的梢头，在那上面动荡和摇摆的时候，它觉得满足和幸福。它在那里望见什么呢？这在它，似乎看见了全世界。各方面都由空气环绕着，这是多么极乐呵！它尽量鼓起后腹来。它兴致很稀奇！它总想要升上去！它在大欢喜中掀起了翅鞘，暂时抖动着网翅——它要升上去，永是升上去——又抖动着它的翅子，爪子放掉了草梗，而且——阿，高兴呀！……呼——呼——它飞起来了——自由而且快乐——到那静穆的，温暖的晚空中。”

“以后呢？”约翰问。

“后文并不有趣，我下回再给你讲罢。”

他们飞过池子了，两只迁延的白胡蝶和他们一同翩跹着。

“这一程往那里去呀，妖精们？”它们问。

“往大的冈蔷薇那里去，那在那边坡上开着花的。”

“我们和你们一路去！”

从远处早就分明看见，她有着她的许多嫩黄的、绵软的花。小蓓蕾已经染得通红，开了的花还显着红色的条纹，作为那一时的记号，那时她们还是蓓蕾的。在寂寞的宁静中开着野生的冈蔷薇，并且将四近满注了她们的奇甜的香味。这是有如此华美，至使冈妖们的食养，就只靠着她们。胡蝶在她们上面盘旋，还一朵一朵地去接吻。

“我们这来，是有一件宝贝要托付你们，”旋儿大声说，“你们肯给我们看管这个么？”

“为什么不呢？为什么不呢？”冈蔷薇细声说，“我是不以守候为苦的——如果人不将我移去，我并不要走动。我又有锋利的刺。”

于是野鼠到了，学校里的小鼠的表姊，在蔷薇的根下掘了一条路。它就运进锁匙去。

“如果你要取回去，就应该再叫我。那么，你就用不着使蔷薇为难。”

蔷薇将她的带刺的枝条交织在进口上，并且郑重允许，忠实地看管着。胡蝶是见证。

第二天的早晨，约翰在自己的床上醒来了，在普烈斯多的旁边，在钟和地毯的旁边。那系着锁匙的挂在他颈上的绳子消失了。

“煞派门！(1)夏天是多么讨厌的无聊呵！”在老屋子的仓库里，很懊恼地一同站着的三个火炉中的一个叹息说，“许多星期以来，我见不到活的东西，也听不到合理的话。而且这久远的内部的空虚！实在可怕！”

“我这里满是蜘蛛网，”第二个说，“这在冬天也不会有的。”

“我并且到处是灰尘，如果那黑的人再来的时候，一定要使我羞死。”

几个灯和火钩，那些，是因为预防生锈，用纸包着，散躺在地上各处的，对于这样轻率的语气，都毫无疑义地宣布抗争。

但谈论突然沉默了，因为吊窗已被拉起，冲进一条光线来，直到最暗的角上，而且将全社会都显出在它们的尘封的混乱里面了。

那是约翰，他来了，而且搅扰了它们的谈话。这仓库常给约翰以强烈的刺激。现在，自从出了最近的奇事以来，他屡屡逃到那里去。他于此发见安静和寂寞。那地方也有一个窗，是用抽替关起来的，也望见冈阜的一面。忽然拉开窗抽替，并且在满是秘密的仓库之后，蓦地看见眼前有遥远的，明亮的景色，直到那白色的，软软地起伏着的连冈，是一种很大的享用。

从那天金曜日的晚上起，早过了三星期了，约翰全没有见到他的朋友。小锁匙也去了，他更缺少了并非做梦的证据。他常怕一切不过是幻想。他就沉静起来。他的父亲忧闷地想，约翰从在冈上的那晚以来，一定是得了病。然而约翰是神往于旋儿。

“他的爱我，不及我的爱他么？”当他站在屋顶窗的旁边，眺望着绿叶繁花的园中时，他琐屑地猜想着，“他为什么不常到我这里来，而且已经很久了呢？倘使我能够……但他也许有许多朋友罢。比起我来，他该是更爱那些罢？……我没有别的朋友，一个也没有。我只爱他。爱得很，唉，爱得很！”

他看见，一群雪白的鸽子的飞翔，怎样地由蔚蓝的天空中降下，这原是以可闻的鼓翼声，在房屋上面盘旋的。那仿佛有一种思想驱遣着它们，每一瞬息便变换方向，宛如要在它们所浮游着的夏光和夏气的大海里，成了排豪饮似的。

它们忽然飞向约翰的屋顶窗前来了，用了各种的鼓翼和抖翅，停在房檐上，在那里它们便忙碌地格磔着，细步往来。其中一匹的翅上有一枝红色的小翎。它拔而又拔，拔得很长久，待到它拔到嘴里的时候，它便飞向约翰，将这交给他。

约翰一接取，便觉得他这样地轻而且快了，正如一个鸽子。他伸开四肢，鸽子飞式的飞起来，约翰并且漂浮在它们的中央，在自由的空气中和清朗的日光里。环绕着他的更无别物，除了纯净的蓝碧和洁白的鸽翅的闪闪的光辉。

他们飞过了林中的大花园，那茂密的树梢在远处波动，像是碧海里的波涛。约翰向下看，看见他父亲坐在住房的畅开的窗边；西蒙是拳着前爪坐在窗台上，而且晒太阳取暖。

“他们看见我没有？”他想，然而叫呢他却不敢。

普烈斯多在园子里奔波，遍齅着各处的草丛，各坐的墙后，还抓着各个温室的门户，想寻出小主人来。

“普烈斯多！普烈斯多！”约翰叫着。小狗仰视，便摇尾，而且诉苦地呻吟。

“我回来，普烈斯多！等着就是！”约翰大声说，然而他已经离得太远了。

他们飘过树林去，乌鸦在有着它们的窠的高的枝梢上，哑哑地叫着飞翔。这正是盛夏，满开的菩提树花的香气云一般从碧林中升腾起来。在一枝高的菩提树梢的一个空巢里，坐着旋儿，额上的他的冠是旋花的花托，向约翰点点头。

“你到这里了？这很好，”他说，“我教迎取你去了。我们就可以长在一处——如果你愿意。”

“我早愿意。”约翰说。

他于是谢了给他引导的友爱的鸽子，和旋儿一同降到树林中。

那地方是凉爽而且多荫。鹪鹩几乎永是唿哨着这一套，但也微有一些分别。

“可怜的鸟儿，”旋儿说，“先前它是天堂鸟。这你还可以从它那特别的黄色的翅子上认出来——但它改变了，而且被逐出天堂了。有一句话，这句话能够还给它原先的华美的衣衫，并且使它再回天堂去。然而它忘却了这句话。现在它天天在试验，想再觅得它。虽然有一两句的类似，但都不是正对的。”

无数飞蝇在穿过浓阴的日光中，飞扬的晶粒似的营营着。人如果留神倾听，便可以听出，它们的营营，宛如一场大的、单调的合奏，充满了全树林，仿佛是日光的歌唱。

繁密的深绿的莓苔盖着地面，而约翰又变得这么小了，他见得这像是大森林区域里的一座新林。干子是多么精美，丛生是多么茂密。要走通是不容易的，而且苔林也显得非常之大。

于是他们到了一座蚂蚁的桥梁。成百的蚂蚁忙忙碌碌地在四处走——有几个在颚间衔着小树枝、小叶片或小草梗。这是有如此杂沓，至使约翰几乎头晕了。

许多工夫之后，他们才遇到一个蚂蚁，愿意和他们来谈天。它们全体都忙于工作。他们终于遇见一个年老的蚂蚁，那差使是，为着看守细小的蚜虫的，蚂蚁们由此得到它们的甘露。因为它的畜群很安静，它已经可以顾及外人了，还将那大的窠指示给他们。窠是在一株大树的根上盖造起来的，很宽广，而且包含着百数的道路和房间。蚜虫牧者加以说明，还引了访问者往各处，直到那有着稚弱的幼虫从白色的襁褓中匍匐而出的儿童室。约翰是惊讶而且狂喜了。

年老的蚂蚁讲起，为了就要发生的军事，大家正在强大的激动里。对于离此不远的别一蚁群，要用大的强力去袭击，扫荡窠巢，劫夺幼虫或者杀戮；这是要尽全力的，大家就必须预先准备那最为切要的工作。

“为什么要有军事呢？”约翰说，“这我觉得不美。”

“不然，不然！”看守者说，“这是很美的可以赞颂的军事。想罢，我们要去攻取的，是战斗蚂蚁呵；我们去，只为歼灭它们这一族，这是很好的事业。”

“你们不是战斗蚂蚁么？”

“自然不是！你在怎样想呢？我们是平和蚂蚁。”

“这是什么意思呢？”

“你不知道这事么？我要告诉你。有那么一个时候，因为一切蚂蚁常常战争，免于大战的日子是没有的。于是出了一位好的有智慧的蚂蚁，它发见，如果蚂蚁们彼此约定，从此不再战争，便将省去许多的劳力。待到它一说，大家觉得这特别，并且就因为这原因，大家开始将它咬成小块了。后来又有别的蚂蚁们，也像它一样的意思。这些也都被咬成了小块。然而终于，这样的是这么多，至使这咬断的事，在别个也成了太忙的工作。从此它们便自称平和蚂蚁，而且都主张那第一个平和蚂蚁是不错的。有谁来争辩，它们这边便将它撕成小块子。这模样，所有蚂蚁就几乎都成了平和蚂蚁了，那第一个平和蚂蚁的残体，还被慎重而敬畏地保存起来。我们有着头颅，是真正的。我们已经将别的十二个自以为有真头的部落毁坏，并且屠戮了。它们自称平和蚁，然而自然倒是战斗蚁，因为真的头为我们所有，而平和蚂蚁是只有一个头的。现在我们就要动手，去歼除那第十三个。这确是一件好事业。”

“是呵，是呵，”约翰说，“这很值得注意！”

他本有些怕起来了，但当他们谢了恳切的牧者并且作过别，远离了蚂蚁民族，在羊齿草丛的阴凉之下，休息在一枝美丽的弯曲的草梗上的时候，他便觉得安静得许多了。

“阿！”约翰叹息，“那是一个渴血的胡涂的社会！”

旋儿笑着，一上一下地低昂着他所坐的草梗。

“阿！”他说，“你不必责备它们胡涂。人们若要聪明起来，还须到蚂蚁那里去。”

于是旋儿指示约翰以树林的所有的神奇——他们俩飞向树梢的禽鸟们，又进茂密的丛莽，下到土拨鼠的美术的住所，还看老树腔里的蜂房。

末后，他们到了一个围着树丛的处所。成堆成阜地生着忍冬藤。繁茂的枝条到处蔓延在灌木之上，群绿里盛装着馥郁的花冠。一只吵闹的白颊鸟，高声地唧唧足足着，在嫩枝间跳跃而且鼓翼。

“给我们在这里过一会罢，”约翰请托，“这里是美观的。”

“好，”旋儿说，“你也就要看见一点可笑的。”

地上的草里，站着蓝色的铃兰。约翰坐在其中一株的近旁，并且开始议论那蜜蜂和胡蝶。这些是铃兰的好朋友，因此这谈天就像河流一般。

但是，那是什么呢？一个大影子来到草上，还有仿佛白云似的东西在铃兰上面飘下来。约翰几乎来不及免于粉身碎骨——他飞向那坐在盛开的忍冬花里的旋儿。他这才看出，那白云是一块手巾——并且，蓬！——在手巾上，也在底下的可怜的铃兰上，坐下了一个肥胖的太太。

他无暇怜惜它，因为声音的喧哗和树枝的骚扰充满了林中的隙地，而且，来了一大堆人们。

“那就，我们要笑了。”旋儿说。

于是他们来了，那人类——女人们手里拿着篮子和伞，男人们头上戴着高而硬的黑帽子。他们几乎统是黑的，漆黑的。他们在晴明的碧绿的树林里，很显得特殊，正如一个大而且丑的墨污，在一幅华美的图画上。

灌木被四散冲开，花朵踏坏了。又摊开了许多白手巾，柔顺的草茎和忍耐的莓苔是叹息着在底下担负，还恐怕遭了这样的打击，从此不能复元。

雪茄的烟气在忍冬丛上蜿蜒着，凶恶地赶走它们的花的柔香。粗大的声音吓退了欢乐的白颊鸟的鸣噪，这在恐怖和忿怒中唧唧地叫着，逃向近旁的树上去了。

一个男人从那堆中站起来，并且安在冈尖上。他有着长的、金色的头发和苍白的脸。他说了几句，大家便都大张着嘴，唱起歌来，有这么高声，致使乌鸦们都嘎嘎地从它们的窠巢飞到高处，还有好奇的野兔，本是从冈边上过来看一看的，也吃惊地跑走，并且直跑至整一刻钟之久，才又安全地到了沙冈。

旋儿笑了，用一片羊齿叶抵御着雪茄的烟气；约翰的眼里含了泪，却并不是因为烟。

“旋儿，”他说，“我要走开，有这么讨厌和喧闹。”

“不，我们还该停留。你就要笑，还有许多好玩的呢。”

唱歌停止了，那苍白男人便起来说话。他大声嚷，要使大家都懂得，但他所说的，却过于亲爱。他称人们为兄弟和姊妹，并且议论那华美的天然，还议论造化的奇迹，论上帝的日光，论花和禽鸟。

“这叫什么？”约翰问，“他怎么说起这个来呢？他认识你么？他是你的朋友么？”

旋儿轻蔑地摇那戴冠的头。

“他不认识我，太阳、禽鸟、花，也一样地很少。凡他所说的，都是谎。”

人们十分虔敬地听着。那坐在蓝的铃兰上面的胖太太，还哭出来了好几回，用她的衣角来拭泪，因为她没有可使的手巾。

苍白的男人说，上帝为了他们的聚会，使太阳这样快活地照临。旋儿便讪笑他，并且从密叶中将一颗槲树子掷在他的鼻子上。

“他要换一个别的意见，”他说，“我的父亲须为他们照临——他究竟妄想着什么！”

但那苍白的男人，却因为要防这仿佛从空中落下来似的槲树子，正在冒火了。他说得很长久，越久声音就越高。末后，他脸上是青一阵红一阵，他捏起拳头，而且嚷得这样响，至于树叶都发抖，野草也吓得往来动摇。待到他终于再平静下去的时候，大家却又歌唱起来了。

“呸，”一只白头鸟，是从高树上下来看看热闹的，说，“这是可惊的胡闹！倘是一群牛们来到树林里，我倒还要喜欢些。听一下子罢，呸！”

唔，那白头鸟是懂事的，也有精微的鉴别。

歌唱之后，大家便从篮子、盒子和纸兜里拉出各种食物来。许多纸张摊开了，小面包和香橙分散了。也看见瓶子。

于是旋儿便召集他的同志们，并且开手，进攻这宴乐的团体。

一匹大胆的虾蟆跳到一个年老的小姐的大腿上，紧靠着她正要咀嚼的小面包，并且停在那里，似乎在惊异它自己的冒险。这小姐发一声大叫，惊愕地凝视着攻击者，自己却不敢去触它。这勇敢的例子得了仿效。碧绿的青虫们大无畏地爬上了帽子、手巾和小面包，到处散布着愁闷和惊疑，大而胖的十字蜘蛛将灿烂的丝放在麦酒杯上、头上以及颈子上，而且在它们的袭击之后，总接着一声尖锐的叫喊。无数的蝇直冲到人们的脸上来，还为着好东西牺牲了它们的性命，它们倒栽在食品和饮料里，因为它们的身体连东西也弄得不能享用了。临末，是来了看不分明的成堆的蚂蚁，随处成百地攻击那敌人，不放一个人在这里做梦。这却惹起了混乱和惊惶！男人们和女人们都慌忙从压得那么久了的莓苔和小草上跳起来。那可怜的小蓝铃儿也被解放了，靠着两匹蚂蚁在胖太太的大腿上的成功的袭击。绝望更加厉害了。人们旋转着、跳跃着，想在很奇特的态度中来避开他们的追击者。苍白的男人抵抗了许多时，还用一枝黑色的小棍，愤愤地向各处打。然而两匹勇敢的蚂蚁，那是什么兵器都会用的，还有一个胡蜂钻进他的黑裤子，在腿肚上一刺，使他失了战斗的能力。

这快活的太阳也就不能久驻，将他的脸藏在一片云后面了。大雨淋着这战斗的两党。仿佛是因为雨，地面上突然生出大的黑的地菌的森林来似的。这是张开的雨伞。几个女人将衣裳盖在头上，于是分明看见白的小衫，白袜的腿和不带高跟的鞋子。不，旋儿觉得多么好玩呵！他笑得必须紧抓着花梗了。

雨越下越密了，它开始将树林罩在一个灰色的发光的网里。纷纷的水溜，从伞上，从高帽子上，以及水甲虫的甲壳一般发着闪的黑衣服上直流下来，鞋在湿透的地上劈劈拍拍地响。人们于是交卸了，并且成了小群默默地退走。只留下一堆纸、空瓶子和橙子皮，当作他们访问的无味的遗踪。树林中的空旷的小草地上，便又寂寂与安静起来，即刻只听得独有雨的单调的淅沥。

“唔，约翰，我们也见过人类了，你为什么不也讥笑他们呢？”

“唉，旋儿，所有人们都这样的么？”

“阿！有些个还要恶得多，坏得多呢。他们常常狂躁和胡闹，凡有美丽和华贵的，便毁灭它。他们砍倒树木，在他们的地方造起笨重的四角的房子来。他们任性踏坏花朵们，还为了他们的高兴，杀戮那凡有在他们的范围之内的各动物。他们一同盘据着的城市里，全都是污秽和乌黑，空气是浑浊的，且被尘埃和烟气毒掉了。他们是太疏远了天然和他们的同类，所以一回到天然这里，他们便做出这样的疯颠和凄惨的模样来。”

“唉，旋儿，旋儿！”

“你为什么哭呢，约翰？你不必因为你是生在人类中的便哭。我爱你，我是从一切别的里面将你选出来的。我已经教你懂得禽鸟和胡蝶和花的观察了。月亮认识你，而这好的柔和的大地，也爱你如它的最爱的孩子一般。我是你的朋友，你为什么不高兴的呢？”

“阿，旋儿！我高兴，我高兴的！但我仍要哭，为着一切的这人类！”

“为什么呢？如果这使你忧愁，你用不着和他们在一处。你可以住在这里，并且永久追随着我。我们要在最密的树林里盘桓，在寂寞的、明朗的沙冈上，或者在池边的芦苇里。我要带你到各处去，到水底里，在水草之间，到妖精的宫阙里，到小鬼头(2)的住所里。我要同你飘泛，在旷野和森林上，在远方的陆地和海面上。我要使蜘蛛给你织一件衣裳，并且给你翅子，像我所生着的似的。我们要靠花香为生，还在月光中和妖精们跳舞。秋天一近，我们便和夏天一同迁徙，到那繁生着高大的椰树的地方，彩色的花伞挂在峰头，还有深蓝的海面在日光中灿烂，而且我要永久讲给你童话。你愿意么，约翰？”

“那我就可以永不住在人类里面了么？”

“在人类里忍受着你的无穷的悲哀、烦恼、艰窘和忧愁。每天每天，你将使你苦辛，而且在生活的重担底下叹息。他们会用他们的粗犷来损伤或窘迫你柔弱的灵魂。他们将使你无聊和苦恼到死。你爱人类过于爱我么？”

“不，不！旋儿，我要留在你这里！”

他对旋儿表示，他怎样地很爱他。他愿意将一切和所有自己这一面的抛弃和遗忘。他的小房子，他的父亲和普烈斯多。高兴而坚决地他重述他的愿望。

雨停止了，在灰色的云底下，闪出一片欢喜的微笑的太阳光，经过树林，照着湿而发光的树叶，还照着在所有枝梗上闪烁，并且装饰着张在槲树枝间的蛛网的水珠。从丛草中的湿地上，腾起一道淡淡的雾气来，夹带着千数甘美的梦幻的香味。白头鸟这时飞上了最高的枝梢，用着简短的、亲密的音节，为落日歌唱——仿佛它要试一试，怎样的歌，才适宜于这严肃的晚静，和为下堕的水珠作温柔的同伴。

“这不比人声还美么，约翰？是的，白头鸟早知道敲出恰当的音韵了。这里一切都是谐和，一个如此完全的，你在人类中永远得不到。”

“什么是谐和，旋儿？”

“这和幸福是一件事。一切都向着它努力。人类也这样。但他们总是弄得像那想捉胡蝶的儿童。正因为他们的拙笨的努力，却将它惊走了。”

“我会在你这里得到谐和么？”

“是的，约翰！那你就应该将人类忘却。生在人类里，是一个恶劣的开端，然而你还幼小——你必须将在你记忆上的先前的人间生活一一除去。这些都会使你迷惑和错乱、纷争、零落。那你就要像我所讲的幼小的金虫一样了。”

“它后来怎样了呢？”

“它看见明亮的光，那老甲虫说起过的。它想，除了即刻飞往那里之外，它不能做什么较好的事了。它直线地飞到一间屋，并且落在人手里。它在那里受苦至三日之久！它坐在纸匣里，人用一条线系在它腿上，还使它这样地飞！于是它挣脱了，并且失去了一个翅子和一条腿，而且终于——其间它无助地在地毯上四处爬，也徒劳地试着往那园里去——被一只沉重的脚踏碎了。一切动物，约翰，凡是在夜里到处彷徨的，正如我们一样，是太阳的孩子。它们虽然从来没有见过它们的晃耀的父亲，却仍然永是引起一种不知不觉的记忆，向往着发光的一切。千数可怜的幽暗的生物，就从这对于久已迁移和疏远了的太阳的爱，得到极悲惨的死亡。一个不可解的、不能抗的冲动，就引着人类向那毁坏，向那警起他们而他们所不识的大光的幻象那里去。”

约翰想要发问似的仰视旋儿的眼。但那眼却幽深而神秘，一如众星之间的黑暗的天。

“你想上帝么？”他终于战战兢兢地问。

“上帝？”这幽深的眼睛温和地微笑，“只要你说出话来，约翰，我便知道你所想的是什么。你想那床前的椅子，你每晚上在它前面说那长的祷告的——想那教堂窗上的绿绒的帏幔，你每日曜日的早晨看得它这么长久的——想那你的赞美歌书的花纹字母——想那带着长柄的铃包(3)——想那坏的歌唱和熏蒸的人气。你用了那一个名称所表示的，约翰，是一个可笑的幻象——不是太阳而是一盏大的煤油灯，成千成百的飞虫儿在那上面无助地紧粘着。”

“但这大光是怎么称呼呢，旋儿？我应该向谁祷告呢？”

“约翰，这就像一个霉菌问我，这带着它旋转着的大地，应当怎样称呼。如果对于你的询问有回答，那你就将懂得它，有如蚯蚓之于群星的音乐了。祷告呢，我倒是愿意教给你的。”

旋儿和那在沉静的惊愕中、深思着他的话的小约翰，飞出树林，这样高，至于沿着冈边，分明见得是长的金闪闪的一线。他们再飞远去，变幻的成影的丘冈景色都在他们的眼下飞逝，而光的线是逐渐宽广起来。沙冈的绿色消失了，岸边的芦苇见得黯淡，也如特别的浅蓝的植物，生长其间。又是一排连冈，一条伸长的、狭窄的沙线，于是就是那广远的雄伟的海。蓝的是宽大的水面，直到远处的地平线，在太阳下，却有一条狭的线发着光，闪出通红的晃耀。

一条长的、白的飞沫的边镶着海面，宛如黄鼬皮上镶了蓝色的天鹅绒。

地平线上分出一条柔和的、天和水的奇异的界线。这像是一个奇迹：直的，且是弯的；截然的，且是游移的；分明的，且是不可捉摸的。这有如曼长而梦幻地响着的琴声，似乎绕缭着，然而且是消歇的。

于是小约翰坐在沙阜边上眺望——长久地不动地沉默着眺望——一直到他仿佛应该死，仿佛这宇宙的大的黄金的门庄严地开开了，而且仿佛他的小小的灵魂，径飘向无穷的最初的光线去。

一直到从他那圆睁的眼里涌出的人世的泪，幕住了美丽的太阳，并且使那天和地的豪华回向那暗淡的、颤动的黄昏里……

“你须这样地祷告！”其时旋儿说。

你当晴明的秋日，在树林里徘徊没有？当太阳如此沉静和明朗，在染色的叶子上发光，当树枝萧骚着，枯叶在你的脚下颤抖着的时候。

于是树林显得很疲倦——它只是还能够沉思，并且生活在古老的记忆里。一片蓝色的雾围住它，有如一个梦挟着满是神秘的绚烂。还有那明晃晃的秋丝，飘泛在空气里懒懒地回旋，像是美丽的、沉静的梦。

单在莓苔和枯叶之间的湿地上，这时就骤然而且暧昧地射出菌类的奇异的形象来。许多胖的，不成样子而且多肉。此外是长的，还是瘦长，带着有箍的柄和染得亮晶晶的帽子。这是树林的奇特的妙。

于是在朽烂的树身上，也看见无数小小的白色的小干，都有黑的小尖子，像烧过似的。有几个聪明人以为这是一种香菌。约翰却学得一个更好的：

那是烛。它们在沉静的秋夜燃烧着，小鬼头们便坐在旁边，读着细小的小书。

这是在一个极其沉静的秋日，旋儿教给他的，而且约翰还饮着梦兴，其中含有从林地中升腾起来的熏蒸的气息。

“为什么这槲树的叶子带着这样的黑斑呢？”

“是呵，这也是小鬼头们弄的，”旋儿说，“倘若他们夜里写了字，就将他们小墨水瓶里的剩余洒在叶子上。他们不能容忍这树。人从槲树的木材做出十字架和铃包的柄来。”

对于这细小的精勤的小鬼头们，约翰觉得新奇了，他还请旋儿允许，领他去见他们之中的一个去。

他已经和旋儿久在一处了，他在他的新生活中，非常幸福，使他对于忘却一切旧事物的誓约，很少什么后悔。他没有寂寞的一刹那，一寂寞是常会后悔的。旋儿永不离开他，跟着他就到处都是乡里。他安静地在挂在碧绿的芦干之间的、苇雀的摇动的窠巢里睡眠，虽然苇雀也大叫，或者乌鸦报凶似的哑哑着。他在潇潇的大雨或怒吼的狂风中，并不觉得恐怖，他就躲进空树或野兔的洞里去，或者他钻在旋儿的小氅衣下，如果他讲童话，他还倾听他的声音。

于是他就要看见小鬼头了。

这是适宜的日子。太沉静，太沉静。约翰似乎已经听到他们的细语和足音了，然而还是正午。禽鸟们是走了，都走了，只有嗌雀还馋着深红的莓果。一匹是落在圈套里被捕了，它张了翅子挂在那里，而且挣扎着，直到那紧紧夹住的爪子几乎撕开。约翰即刻去放了它，高兴地啾唧着，它迅速地飞去了。

菌类是彼此都陷在热烈的交谈中。

“看看我罢，”一个肥胖的鬼菌说，“你们见过这样的么？看罢，我的柄是多么肥，多么白呀，我的帽子是多么亮呀。我是一切中最大的。而且在一夜里。”

“哼！”红色的捕蝇菌说，“你真蠢。这样棕色和粗糙。而我却在芦干一般的我的苗条的柄上摇摆。我华美地红得像鸟莓，还美丽地加了点。我比一切都美。”

“住口！”早就认识它们的约翰说，“你们俩都是毒的。”

“这是操守！”捕蝇菌说。

“你大概是人罢？”肥胖者讥笑地唠叨着，“那我早就愿意了，你吃掉我！”

约翰果然不吃。他拿起一条枯枝来，插进那多肉的帽里去。这见得很滑稽，其余的一切都笑了。还有一群微弱的小菌，有着棕色的小头，是大约两小时内一同钻出来的，并且往外直冲，为要观察这世界。那鬼菌因为愤怒变成蓝色了。这也正表白了它是有毒的种类。

地星在四尖的脚凳上伸起它们的圆而肿起的小头。有时就用那圆的小头上的嘴里的极细的尘土，喷成一朵棕色的小云彩。那尘土落在湿地上，就有黑土组成的线，而且第二年便生出成百的新的地星来。

“怎样的一个美的生存呵！”它们彼此说，“扬尘是最高的生活目的。生活几多时，就扬尘几多时，是怎样的幸福呵！”

于是它们用了深信的向往，将小小的尘云驱到空气中。

“他们对么，旋儿？”

“为什么不呢？它们那里还能够更高一点呢？它们并不多要求幸福，因为此外它们再不能够了。”

夜已深，树影都飞进了一律的黑暗里的时候，充满秘密的树林的震动没有停。在草和丛莽中间，处处有小枝们瑟瑟着、格格着，枯的小叶子们簌簌着。约翰感觉着不可闻的鼓翼的风动，且知道不可辨的东西来到近旁了。现在他却听得有分明的声音在细语，还有脚在细步地跳跃了。看哪，丛莽的黑暗的深处，正有一粒小小的蓝的火星在发光，而且消失了。那边又一粒，而且又一粒！静着！……倘若他留神倾听，便听得树叶里有一种簌簌声，就在他极近旁——靠近那黑暗的树干的所在。这蓝的小光就从它后面起来，并且停在尖上了。

现在约翰看见到处闪着火光。它们在黑暗的枝柯间飘浮，小跳着吹到地面，还有大的闪烁的一堆，如一个愉快的火，在众星间发亮。

“这是什么火呢？”约翰问，“这烧得辉煌。”

“这是一个朽烂的树干。”旋儿说。

他们走向一粒沉静的、明亮的小光去。

“那我就要给你介绍将知(1)了。他是小鬼头们中最年老，且最伶俐的。”

约翰临近的时候，他看见他坐在他的小光旁边。在蓝色的照映中，可以分明地辨别打皱的脸带着灰色的胡须；他蹙着眉头，高声地诵读着。小头上戴一顶槲斗的小帽还插一枝小翎，前面坐着一个十字蜘蛛，并且对他倾听。

待到他们俩接近时，小鬼头便扬起眉毛来看，却不从他的小书上抬头。十字蜘蛛爬去了。

“好晚上，”小鬼头说，“我是将知。你们俩是谁呢？”

“我叫约翰。我很愿意和你相识。你在那里读什么呢？”

“这不合于你的耳朵，”将知说，“这仅只是为那十字蜘蛛的。”

“也给我看一看罢，爱的将知。”约翰恳求说。

“这我不可以。这是蜘蛛的圣书，我替它们保存着的，并且永不得交在别一个的手里。我有神圣的文件，那甲虫的和胡蝶的、刺猬的、土拨鼠的，以及凡有生活在这里的一切的。它们不能都读，倘它们想要知道一些，我便读给它们听。这于我是一个大大的光荣，一个信任的职位，你懂么？”

那小男人屡次十分诚恳地点头，且向高处伸上一个示指去。

“你刚才做了什么了呢？”

“讲那涂鸦泼剌的故事。那是十字蜘蛛中的大英雄，很久以前活着的，而且有一个网张在三棵大树上，它还在那里一日里捉获过一千二百匹飞蝇们。在涂鸦泼剌时代以前，蜘蛛们是都不结网，单靠着草和死动物营生的，涂鸦泼剌却有一个明晰的头脑。并且指出，活的动物也都为着蜘蛛的食料而创造。其时涂鸦泼剌又靠着繁难的计算，发明了十分精美的网，因为它是一位伟大的数学家。于是十字蜘蛛才结它的网，线交线，正如它所传授的一样，只是小得多。因为蜘蛛的族类也很变种了。涂鸦泼剌曾在它的网上捉获过大禽鸟，还杀害过成千的它自己的孩子们——这曾是一个大的蜘蛛呵！末后，来了一阵大风，便拖着涂鸦泼剌和它的网带着紧结着网的三棵树，都穿过空中，到了远方的树林里，在那里它便永被崇拜了，因了它的大凶心和它的机巧。”

“这都是真实么？”约翰问。

“那是载在这书儿上的。”将知说。

“你相信这些么？”

小鬼头细着一只眼，且将示指放在鼻子上。

“在别种动物的圣书里，也曾讲过涂鸦泼剌的，它被称为一个剽悍的和卑劣的怪物。我于此不加可否。”

“可也有一本地祇的书儿呢，将知？”

将知微微怀疑地看定了约翰。

“你究竟是一个什么东西呢，约翰？你有点——有点是人似的，我可以说。”

“不是，不是！放心罢，将知，”旋儿说，“我们是妖。约翰虽然先前常在人类里往来。但你可以相信他。这于他无损的。”

“是呵，是呵！那很好，然而我倒是地祇中的最贤明的，我并且长久而勤勉地研究过，直到知道了我现今所知道的一切。因了我的智慧，我就必须谨慎。如果我讲得太多，就毁损我的名声。”

“你以为在什么书儿上，是记着正确的事的呢？”

“我曾经读得很不少，但我却不信我读过这些书。那须不是妖精书，也不是地祇书。然而那样的书儿是应该存在的。”

“那是人类书么？”

“那我不知道，但我不大相信，因为真的书儿是应该能致大幸福和大太平的——在那上面，应该详细地记载着，为什么一切是这样的，像现状这样。那就谁也不能再多问或多希望了。人类还没有到这地步，我相信。”

“阿，实在的。”旋儿笑着说。

“然而也真有这样的一本书儿么？”约翰切望地问。

“有，有！”小鬼头低声说，“那我知道——从古老的，古老的传说。静着呀！我又知道，它在那里，谁能够觅得它。”

“阿，将知！将知！”

“为什么你还没有呢？”旋儿问。

“只要耐心，这就要来了。几个条件我还没有知道。但不久我就要觅得了。我曾毕生为此工作而且向此寻求。因为一觅得，则生活将如晴明的秋日，上是蓝色的天而周围是蓝色的雾；但没有落叶簌簌着，没有小枝格格着，也没有水珠点滴着；阴影将永不变化，树梢的金光将永不惨淡。谁曾读过这书，则凡是于我们显得明的，将是黑暗，凡是于我们显得幸福的，将是忧愁。是的，我都知道，而且我也总有一回要觅得它。”

那山鬼很高地扬起眉毛，并且将手指搁在嘴上。

“将知，你许能教给我罢。”约翰提议道，但他还未说完，便觉得有猛烈的风的一突，还看见一个又大又黑的形象在自己前面迅速而无声地射过去了。

他回顾将知时，他还及见一只细小的脚怎样地消没在树干里，噗哧！小鬼头连那书儿都跳进他的洞里去了。小光烧得渐渐地微弱了，而且忽然消灭了。那是非常奇特的烛。

“那是什么？”在暗中紧握着旋儿的约翰问。

“一个猫头鹰。”旋儿说。

两个都沉默了好些时。约翰于是问道：“将知所说的，你相信么？”

“将知却并不如他所自负似的伶俐。那样的书他永远觅不到，你也觅不到的。”

“然而有是有的罢？”

“那书儿的存在，就如你的影子的存在，约翰。你怎样地飞跑，你怎样地四顾着想攫取，也总不能抓住或拿回。而且你终于觉着，你是在寻觅自己呢。不要做呆子，并且忘掉了那山鬼的胡说罢！我愿意给你讲一百个更好的故事呢。同我来，我们不如到林边去，看我们的好父亲怎样地从睡觉的草上，揭起那洁白的、绵软的露被来罢。同来呵！”

约翰走着，然而他不懂旋儿的话，也不从他的忠告。他看见灿烂的秋晨一到黎明，便想那书儿，在那上面，是写着为什么一切是这样，像现状这样的——他并且低声自己反复着说道：“将知！将知！”

六


从此以后，他在树林中和沙阜上，旋儿的旁边，似乎不再那么高兴和自得了。凡有旋儿所讲述和指示的，都不能满足他的思想。他每次必想那小书，但议论却不敢。他所看见的，也不再先前似的美丽和神奇了。云是这样地黑而重，使他恐怖，仿佛就要从头上压下来。倘秋风不歇地摇撼和鞭扑这可怜的疲倦的林木，致使浅绿的叶腹翻向上边，以及黄色的柯叶和枯枝在空气中飘摇时，也使他觉得悲痛。

旋儿所说的，于他不满足。许多是他不懂，即使提出一个他所日夜操心的问题来，他也永是得不到圆满分明的答案。他于是又想那一切全都这样清楚和简单地写着的小书，想那将来的永是晴明而沉静的秋日。

“将知！将知！”

“约翰，我怕你终于还是一个人，你的友情也正如人类的一样，在我之后和你说话的第一个，将你的信任全都夺去了。唉，我的母亲一点也不错。”

“不，旋儿！你却聪明过于将知，你也聪明如同小书。你为什么不告诉我一切的呢？就看罢！为什么风吹树木，至使它们必须弯而又弯呢？它们不能再——最美的枝条折断，成百的叶儿纷坠，纵然它们也还碧绿和新鲜。它们都这样地疲乏，也不再能够支撑了，但仍然从这粗野的恶意的风，永是从新的摇动和打击。为什么这样的呢？风要怎样呢？”

“可怜的约翰！这是人的议论呵！”

“使它静着罢，旋儿。我要安静和日光。”

“你的质问和愿望都很像一个人，因此既没有回答，更没有满足。如果你不去学学质问和希望些较好的事，那秋日便将永不为你黎明，而你也将如说起将知的成千的人们一样了。”

“有这么多的人们么？”

“是的，成千的！将知做得很秘密，但他仍然是一个永不能沉默他的秘密的胡涂的饶舌者。他希望在人间觅得那小书，且向每个或者能够帮助他的人宣传他的智慧。他并且已经将许多人们因此弄得不幸了。人们相信他，想自己觅得那书，正如几个试验炼金的一样地热烈。他们牺牲一切，忘却了所有他们的工作和他们的幸福，而自己监禁在厚的书籍、奇特的工具和装置之间。他们将生活和健康抛在一旁，他们忘却了蔚蓝的天和这温和的慈惠的天然——以及他们的同类。有时他们也觅得紧要和有用的东西，有如从他们的洞穴里，掷上明朗的地面来的金块似的。他们自己和这不相干，让别人去享用，而自己却奋发地无休无息地在黑暗里更向远处掘和挖。他们并非寻金，倒是寻小书，他们沉沦得越深，离花和光就越远，由此他们希望得越多，而他们的期待也越滋长。有几个却因这工作而昏聩了，忘其所以，一直捣乱到苦恼的儿戏。于是那山鬼便将他们变得稚气。人看见，他们怎样地用沙来造小塔，并且计算到它落成为止要用多少粒沙；他们做小瀑布，并且细算那水所形成的各个涡和各个浪；他们掘小沟，还应用所有他们的坚忍和才智，为的是将这掘得光滑，而且没有小石头。倘有谁来搅扰了在他们工作上的这昏迷，并且问，他们做着什么事。他们便正经地重要地看定你，还喃喃道：‘将知！将知！’

“是的，一切都是那么的可恶的山鬼的罪！你要小心他，约翰！”

但约翰却凝视着对面的摇动和呼哨的树木。在他明彻的孩童眼上，嫩皮肤都打起皱来了。他从来没有这样严正地凝视过。

“而仍然——你自己说过——那书儿是存在的！阿，我确实知道，那上面也载着你所不愿意说出名字来的那大光。”

“可怜的，可怜的约翰！”旋儿说，他的声音如超出于暴风雨声之上的平和的歌颂，“爱我，以你的全存在爱我罢。在我这里，你所觅得的会比你所希望的还要多。凡你所不能想像的，你将了然，凡你所希望知道的，你将是自己。天和地将是你的亲信，群星将是你的同胞，无穷将是你的住所。”

“爱我，爱我——霍布草蔓之于树似的围抱我，海之于地似的忠于我——只有在我这里是安宁，约翰！”

旋儿的话消歇了，然而颂歌似的袅袅着。它从远处飘荡而来，匀整而且庄严，透过了风的吹拂和呼啸——平和如月色，那从相逐的云间穿射出来的。

旋儿伸开臂膊，约翰睡在他的胸前，用蓝的小氅衣保护着。

他夜里却醒来了。沉静是蓦地不知不觉地笼罩了地面，月亮已经沉没在地平线下。不动地垂着疲倦的枝叶，沉默的黑暗掩盖着树林。

于是问题来了，迅速而阴森地接续着，回到约翰的头里来，并且将还很稚弱的信任驱逐了。为什么人类是这样子的？为什么他应该抛掉他们而且失了他们的爱？为什么要有冬天？为什么叶应该落而花应该死？为什么？为什么？

于是深深地在丛莽里，又跳着那蓝色的小光。它们来来去去。约翰严密地注视着它们。他看见较大的明亮的小光在黑暗的树干上发亮。旋儿酣睡得很安静。

“还有一个问。”约翰想，并且溜出了蓝的小氅衣，去了。

“你又来了？”将知说，还诚意地点头。“这我很喜欢。你的朋友在那里呢？”

“那边！我只还想问一下。你肯回答我么？”

“你曾在人类里，实在的么？你去办我的秘密么？”

“谁会觅得那书儿呢，将知？”

“是呵，是呵！这正是那个，这正是！——你愿意帮助我么，倘我告诉了你？”

“如果我能够，当然！”

“那就听着，约翰！”将知将眼睛张得可怕地大，还将他的眉毛扬得比平常更其高。于是他伸手向前，小声说：“人类存着金箱子，妖精存着金锁匙，妖敌觅不得，妖友独开之。春夜正其时，红膆鸟深知。”

“这是真的么，这是真的么？”约翰嚷着，并且想着他的小锁匙。

“真的！”将知说。

“为什么还没有人得到呢？有这么多的人们寻觅它。”

“凡我所托付你的，我没有告诉过一个人，一个也不。”

“我有着，将知！我能够帮助你！”约翰欢呼起来，并且拍着手，“我去问问旋儿。”

他从莓苔和枯叶上飞回去。但他颠踬了许多回，他的脚步是沉重了。粗枝在他的脚下索索地响，往常是连小草梗也不弯曲的。

这里是茂盛的羊齿草丛，他曾在底下睡过觉。这于他显得多么矮小了呵。

“旋儿！”他呼唤。他就害怕了他自己的声音。

“旋儿！”这就如一个人类的声音似的发响，一匹胆怯的夜莺叫喊着飞去了。

羊齿丛下是空的——约翰看见一无所有。

蓝色的小光消失了，围绕着他的是寒冷和无底的幽暗。他向前看，只见树梢的黑影散布在星夜的空中。

他再叫了一回。于是他不再敢了。他的声音，响出来像是对于安静的天然的亵渎，对于旋儿的名字的讥嘲。

可怜的小约翰于是仆倒，在绝望的后悔里呜咽起来了。





七


早晨是寒冷而黯淡。黑色的光亮的树枝，被暴风雨脱了叶，在雾中哭泣。下垂的湿草上面，慌忙地跑着小约翰，凝视着前面，是树林发亮的地方，似乎那边就摆着他的目的。他的眼睛哭红了，并且因为恐惧和苦恼而僵硬了。他是这样地跑了一整夜，像寻觅着光明似的——和旋儿在一处，他是安稳地如在故乡的感觉。每一暗处，都坐着抛弃的游魂，他也不敢回顾自己的身后。

他终于到了一个树林的边际。他望见一片牧场，那上面徐徐下着细微的尘雨。牧场中央的一株秃柳树旁站着一匹马。它不动地弯着颈子，雨水从它发亮的背脊和粘成一片的鬃毛上懒散地滴沥下来。

约翰还是跑远去，沿着树林。他用了疲乏的恐惧的眼光，看着那孤寂的马和晦暗的雨烟，微微呻吟着。

“现在是都完了，”他想，“太阳就永不回来了。于我就要永是这样，像这里似的。”

在他的绝望中，他却不敢静静地站定——惊人的事就要出现了，他想。

他在那里看见一株带着淡黄叶子的菩提树下，有一个村舍的大的栅栏门和一间小屋子。

他穿进门去，走过宽广的树间路，棕色的和黄的菩提叶，厚铺在地面上。草坛旁边生着紫色的翠菊，还随便错杂着几朵彩色的秋花。

他走近一个池。池旁站着一所全有门户和窗的大屋。蔷薇丛和常春藤生在墙根。半已秃叶的栗树围绕着它，在地上和将落的枝叶之间，约翰还看见闪着光亮的棕色的栗子。

冰冷的死的感觉，从他这里退避了。他想到他自己的住所——那地方也有栗树，当这时候他总是去觅光滑的栗子的。蓦地有一个愿望捆住他了，他似乎听得有熟识的声音在呼唤。他就在大屋旁边的板凳上坐下，并且静静地啜泣起来。

一种特别的气味又引得他抬了头。他近旁站着一个人，系着白色的围裙，还有烟管衔在嘴里。环着腰带有一条菩提树皮，他用它系些花朵。约翰也熟识这气味，他就记起了他在自己的园子里，并且想到那送他美丽的青虫和为他选取鹧鸪蛋的园丁。

他并不怕——虽然站在他身边的也是一个人。他对那人说，他是被抛弃，而且迷路了，他还感谢地跟着他，进那黄叶的菩提树下的小屋去。

那里面坐着园丁的妻，织着黑色的袜子。灶头的煤火上挂一个大的水罐，且煮着。火旁的席子上坐着一匹猫，拳了前爪，正如约翰离家时候坐在那里的西蒙。

约翰要烘干他的脚，便坐在火旁边。“镝！——镝！——镝！——镝！”——那大的时钟说。约翰看看呼哨着从水罐里纷飞出来的蒸汽，看看活泼而游戏地超过瓦器，跳着的小小的火苗。

“我就在人类里了。”他想。

然而于他并无不舒服。他觉得完全安宁了。他们都好心而且友爱，还问他怎样是他最心爱的。

“我最爱留在这里。”他回答说。

这里给他安全，倘一回家，将就有忧愁和眼泪。他必须不开口，人也将说他做了错事了。一切他就须再看见，一切又须想一回。

他实在渴慕着他的小房子，他的父亲，普烈斯多——但比起困苦的愁烦的再见来，他宁可在这里忍受着平静的渴慕。他又觉得，仿佛这里是可以毫无搅扰地怀想着旋儿，在家里便不行了。

旋儿一定是走掉了。远远地到了椰树高出于碧海之上的晴朗的地方去了。他情愿在这里忏悔，并且坚候他。

他因此请求这两个好心的人们，许他留在他那里。他愿意帮助养园和花卉。只在这一冬。因为他私自盼望，旋儿是将和春天一同回来的。

园丁和他的妻以为约翰是在家里受了严刻的待遇，所以逃出来的。他们对他怀着同情，并且许他留下了。

他的愿望实现了。他留下来，帮助那花卉和园子的养护。他们给他一间小房，有一个蓝板的床位。在那里，他早晨看那潮湿的黄色的菩提树叶子怎样地在窗前轻拂，夜间看那黑暗的树干，后面有星星们玩着捉迷藏的游戏，怎样地往来动摇。他就给星星们名字，而那最亮的一颗，他称之为旋儿。

给花卉们呢，那是他在故乡时几乎全都熟识的。他叙述自己的故事，给严正的大的翠菊，给彩色的莘尼亚，给洁白的菊花——那开得很长久，直到凛烈的秋天的。当别的花们全都死去时，菊花还挺立着，待到初雪才下的清晨，约翰一早走来看它们的时候——它们也还伸着愉快的脸，并且说：“是的，我们还在这里呢！这是你没有想到的罢！”它们自以为勇敢，但三天之后，它们却都死了。

温室中这时还盛装着木本羊齿和椰树，在润湿的闷热里，并且挂着兰类的奇特的花须。约翰惊异地凝视在这些华美的花托上，一面想着旋儿。但他一到野外，一切是怎样地寒冷而无色呵，带着黑色的足印的雪，索索作响的滴水的秃树。

倘若雪团沉默着下得很久，树枝因着增长的茸毛而弯曲了，约翰便喜欢走到雪林的紫色的昏黄中去。那是沉静，却不是死。如果那伸开的小枝条的皎洁的白，分布在明蓝的天空中，或者过于负重的丛莽，摇去积雪，使它纷飞成一阵灿烂的云烟的时候，却几乎更美于夏绿。

有一次，就在这样的游行中，他走得很远，周围只看见戴雪的枝条——半黑，半白——而且各个声响、各个生命，仿佛都在灿烂的蒙茸里消融了，于是使他似乎见有一匹小小的白色的动物在他前面走。他追随它——这不像是他所认识的动物——但当他想要捉，它却慌忙消失在一株树干里了。约翰窥探着黑色的穴口，那小动物所伏匿的，并且自问道：“这许是旋儿罢？”

他不甚想念他。他以他为不好，他也不肯轻减他的忏悔。而在两个好人身边的生活，也使他很少疑问了。他虽然每晚必须读一点大而且黑的书，其中许多是关于上帝的议论，但他却认识那书，也读得很轻率。然而在他游行雪地以后的那一夜，他醒着躺在床上，眺望那地上的寒冷的月光。他蓦地看见一双小手，怎样地伸上床架来试探，并且紧紧地扳住了床沿。于是在两手之间显出一个白的小皮帽的尖来，末后，他看见扬起的眉毛之下，一对严正的小眼。

“好晚上，约翰！”将知说，“我到你这里来一下，为的是使你记念我们的前约。你不能觅得那书儿，是因为还不是春天。但你却想着那个么？那是怎样地一本厚书呀，那我看见你所读的？那不能是那正当的呵。不要信它罢！”

“我不信它，将知。”约翰说。他翻一个身，且要睡去了。然而那小锁匙却不肯离开他的心念。从此他每读那本厚书的时候，也就想到那匙儿，于是他看得很清楚，那不是那正当的。





八


“他就要来罢！”当积雪初融，松雪草到处成群出现时，约翰想，“他来不来呢？”他问松雪草。然而它们不知道，只将那下垂的小头尽向地面注视，仿佛它们羞惭着自己的匆遽，也仿佛想要再回地里似的。

只要它们能！冰冷的东风怒吼起来了，雪积得比那可怜的太早的东西还要高。

许多星期以后，紫花地丁来到了。它们的甜香突过了丛莽，而当太阳悠长地温暖地照着生苔的地面的时候，那斑斓的莲馨花们也就成千成百地开起来。

怯弱的紫花地丁和它们的强烈的芳香是将要到来的豪华的秘密的前驱，快活的莲馨花却就是这愉快的现实。醒了的地，将最初的日光紧紧地握住了，还借此给自己做了一种金的装饰。

“然而现在！他现在却一定来了！”约翰想，他紧张地看着枝上的芽，它们怎样地逐日徐徐涌现，并且挣脱厚皮，直到那最初的淡绿的小尖，在棕色的鳞片之间向外窥探。约翰费了许多时光，看那绿色的小叶：他永是看不出它们如何转动，但倘或他略一转瞬，它们又仿佛大了一点了。他想：“倘若我看着它们，它们是不敢的。”

枝柯已经织出阴来。旋儿还没有到，没有鸽子在他这里降下，没有小鼠和他谈天。倘或他对花讲话，它们只是点头，并不回答。“我的罚还没有完罢。”他想。

在一个晴朗的春日里，他来到池旁和屋子前。几个窗户都敞开了。是人们搬进那里去了罢？

站在池边的鸟莓的宿丛，已经都用嫩的小叶子遮盖了，所有枝条，都得到精细的小翅子了。在草地上，靠近鸟莓的宿丛，躺着一个女孩子。约翰只看见她浅蓝的衣裳和她金黄的头发。一匹小小的红膆鸟停在她肩上，从她的手里啄东西。她忽而转过脸来向约翰注视着。

“好天，小孩儿。”她说，并且友爱地点点头。

约翰从头到脚都震悚了。这是旋儿的眼睛，这是旋儿的声音。

“你是谁呀？”他问，因为感动，他的嘴唇发着抖。

“我是荣儿，这里的这个是我的鸟。当你面前它是不害怕的。你可喜欢禽鸟么？”

那红膆鸟在约翰面前并不怯。它飞到他的臂膊上。这正如先前一样。她应该一定是旋儿了，这蓝东西。

“告诉我，你叫什么，小孩儿。”旋儿的声音说。

“你不认识我么？你不知道我叫约翰么？”

“我怎样会知道呢？”

这是什么意思呢？那也还是熟识的甜美的声音，那也还是黑暗的、天一般深的眼睛。

“你怎么这样对我看呢，约翰？你见过我么？”

“我以为，是的。”

“你却一定是做梦了。”

“做梦了？”约翰想，“我是否一切都是做的梦呢？还是此时正在做梦呢？”

“你是在那里生的？”他问。

“离这里很远，在一个大都会里。”

“在人类里么？”

荣儿笑了，那是旋儿的笑。“我想，一定。你不是么？”

“唉，是的，我也是！”

“这于你难受么？——你不喜欢人们么？”

“不！谁能喜欢人们呢？”

“谁？不，约翰。你却是怎样的一个稀奇的小家伙呵！你更爱动物么？”

“阿，爱得多！和那花儿们！”

“我早先原也这样的。只有一次。然而这些都不正当。我们应该爱人类，父亲说。”

“这为什么不正当？我要爱谁，我就爱谁，有什么正当不正当。”

“呸，约翰！你没有父母，或别的照顾你的谁么？你不爱他们么？”

“是呵，”约翰沉思地说，“我爱我的父亲。但不是因为正当，也不因为他是一个人。”

“为什么呢？”

“这我不知道：因为他不像别的人们那样，因为他也爱花们和鸟们。”

“我也曾这样，约翰！你看见了罢。”荣儿还将红膆鸟叫回她的手上来，并且友爱地和它说话。

“这我知道，”约翰说，“我也喜欢你。”

“现在已经？这却快呀！”女孩笑着，“但你最爱谁呢？”

“谁……？”约翰迟疑起来了。他须提出旋儿的名字么？对着人们可否提这名字的畏惧，在他的思想上是分不清楚的。然而那蓝衣服的金发东西，却总该就是那个名目了。此外谁还能给他这样的一个安宁而且幸福的感觉呢？

“你！”他突然说，且将全副眼光看着那深邃的眼睛。他大胆地敢于完全给与了；然而他还担心，紧张地看着对于他的贵重的赠品的接受。

荣儿又发一阵响亮的笑，但她便拉了他的手，而且她的眼光并不更冷漠，她的声音也没有减少些亲密。

“阿，约翰，”她说，“我怎么忽然挣得了这个呢？”

约翰并不回答，还是用了滋长的信任，对着她的眼睛看。荣儿站了起来，将臂膊围了约翰的肩头。她比他年纪大一点。

他们在树林里走，一面采撷些大簇的莲馨花，直至能够全然爬出，到了玲珑的花卉的山下。红膆鸟和他们一起，从这枝飞到那枝，还用了闪闪的漆黑的小眼睛向他们窥伺。

他们谈得并不多，却屡次向旁边互视。两个都惊讶于这相遇，且不知道彼此应该如何。然而荣儿就须回家了——这使他难受。

“我该去了，约翰。但你还愿意和我同走一回么？你真是一个好孩子。”她在分离的时候说。

“唯！唯！”红膆鸟说，并且在她后面飞。

当她已去，只留下她的影像时，他不再疑惑她是谁了。她和他是一个，对于那他，他是送给了一切自己的友爱的。旋儿这名字，在他这里逐渐响得微弱下去了，而且和荣儿混杂了。

他的周围也又如先前一样。花卉们高兴地点头，它们的芳香则将他对于感动和养育他至今的家乡的愁思全都驱逐了。在嫩绿中间，在微温的柔软的春气里，他觉得忽然如在故乡，正如一只觅得了它的窠巢的禽鸟。他应该伸出臂膊来，并且深深地呼吸。他太幸福了。在归途中，是嫩蓝衣的金发飘泛在他眼前，总在他眼前，无论他向那一方面看。那是，仿佛他看了太阳，又仿佛日轮总是和他的眼光一同迁徙似的。

从那一日起，每一清晨，约翰便到池边去。他去得早，只要是垂在窗外的常春藤间的麻雀的争闹，或者在屋檐上鼓翼和初日光中喧嚷着的白头翁的咭或曼声的啾啾来叫醒他，他便慌忙走过湿草，来到房屋的近旁，还在紫丁香丛后等候，直到他听得玻璃门怎样地被推开了，并且看见一个明朗的风姿的临近。

他们于是经过树林和为树林作界的沙冈。他们闲谈着凡有他们所见的一切，谈树木和花草，谈沙冈。倘和她一同走，约翰就有一种奇特的昏迷的感觉：他每又来得这样地轻，似乎能够飞向空中了。但这却没有实现。他叙述花卉和动物的故事，就是从旋儿那里知道的。然而他已经忘却了如何学得那故事，而且旋儿也不再为他存在了，只有荣儿。倘或她对他微笑，或在她眼里看出友情，或和她谈心，纵意所如，毫无迟疑和畏怯，一如先前对着普烈斯多说话的时候，在他是一种享用。倘不相见，他便想她，每作一事，也必自问道，荣儿是否以为好或美呢？

她也显得很高兴。一相见，她便微笑，并且走得更快了。她也曾对他说，她的喜欢和他散步，是和谁也比不上的。

“然而约翰，”有一回，她问，“你从何知道，金虫想什么，嗌雀唱什么，兔洞里和水底里是怎样的呢？”

“它们对我说过，”约翰答道，“而且我自己曾到过兔洞和水底的。”

荣儿蹙了精美的双眉，半是嘲弄地向他看。但她在他那里寻不出虚伪来。

他们坐在丁香丛下，满丛垂着紫色的花。横在他们脚下的是池子带着睡莲和芦苇。他们看见黑色的小甲虫怎样地打着圈子滑过水面，红色的小蜘蛛怎样忙碌地上下泅水。这里是扰动着旋风般的生活。约翰沉在回忆中，看着深处，并且说：

“我曾经没入那里去过的，我顺着一枝荻梗滑下去，到了水底。地面全铺着枯叶子，走起来很软，也很轻。在那里永远是黄昏，绿色的黄昏，因为光线的透入是经过了绿的浮萍的。并且在我头上，看见垂着长而白的浮萍的小根。鲵鱼近来，而且绕着我游泳，它是很好奇的。这是奇特的，假如一个这么大的动物从上面游来——我也不能远望前面，那里是黑暗的，却也绿。就从那幽暗里，动物们都像黑色的影子一般走过来。生着桨爪的水甲虫和光滑的水蜘蛛——往往也有一条小小的鱼儿。我走得很远，我觉得有几小时之远，在那中央，是一坐水草的大森林，其间有蜗牛向上爬着，水蜘蛛们做些光亮的小窠。刺鱼们飞射过去，并且时时张着嘴抖着鬐向我注视，它们是这样地惊疑。我在那里，和我几乎踏着它的尾巴了的一条鳗鱼成了相识。它给我叙述它的旅行。它是一直到过海里的，它说。因此大家便将它当作池子的王了，因为谁也不及它游行得这么远。它却永是躺在泥泞里而且睡觉，除了它得到别个给它弄来的什么吃的东西的时候。它吃得非常之多，这就因为它是王。大家喜欢一个胖王，这是格外的体面。唉，在池子里是太好看了！”

“为什么你现在不能再到那里去了呢？”

“现在？”约翰问，并且用了睁大的沉思的眼睛对她看。“现在？我不再能够了，我会在那里淹死。然而现在也无须了。我愿意在这里，傍着丁香和你。”

荣儿骇异地摇着金发的头，并且抚摩约翰的头发。她于是去看那在池边像是寻觅种种食饵的红膆鸟。它忽然抬起头，用了它的明亮的小眼睛，向两人凝眺了一瞬息。

“你可有懂得么，小鸟儿？”

那小鸟儿很狡猾地向里一看，就又去寻觅和玩耍了。

“给我讲下去，约翰，讲那凡你所看见的。”

这是约翰极愿照办的，荣儿听着他，相信而且凝神地。

“然而为什么全都停止了呢？为什么你现在不能同我——到那边的各处去走呢？那我也很喜欢。”

约翰督促起他的记忆来，然而一幅他曾在那上面走过的晴朗的轻纱，却掩复着深处。他已经不很知道，他怎样地失掉了那先前的幸福了。

“那我不很明白，你不必再问这些罢。一个可恶的小小的东西，将一切都毁掉了。但现在是一切都已回来。比先前还要好。”

紫丁香花香从丛里在他们上面飘泛下来，飞蝇在水面上营营地叫，还有平静的日光，用了甘美的迷醉，将他们沁透了。直到家里的一口钟开始敲打，发出响亮的震动来，才和荣儿迅速地慌忙走去。

这一晚约翰到了他的小屋子里，看着溜过窗玻璃去的常春藤叶的月影的时候，似乎听得叩窗声。约翰以为这许是在风中颤动的一片常春叶。然而叩得很分明，总是一叩三下，使约翰只能轻轻地开了窗，而且谨慎地四顾。小屋边的藤叶子在蓝色的照映里发光，这之下，是一个满是秘密的世界。在那里有窠和洞，月光只投下一点小小的蓝色的星火来，这却使幽暗更加深邃。

许多时光，约翰凝视着那奇异的阴影世界的时候，他终于极清楚地，在高高地挨着窗一片大的常春藤叶下面，看见藏着一个小小的小男人的轮廓。他从那轩起的眉毛下的睁大的骇诧的眼，即刻认出是将知了。在将知的长鼻子的尖端，月亮画上了一点细小的星火。

“你忘掉我了么，约翰？为什么你不想想那个呢？这正是正当的时候了。你还没有向红膆鸟问路么？”

“唉，将知，我须问什么呢？凡我能希望的，我都有了。我有荣儿。”

“但这却不会经久的。你还能更幸福——荣儿一定也如此。那匙儿就须放在那里么？想一想罢，多么出色呵，如果你们俩觅得那书儿。问问红膆鸟去。我愿意帮助你，倘若我能够。”

“我可以问一问。”约翰说。将知点点头，火速地爬下去了。约翰在睡倒以前，还向着黑暗的阴影和发亮的常春藤叶看了许多时。第二天，他问红膆鸟是否知道向那小箱的路径。荣儿惊异地听着。约翰看见，那红膆鸟怎样地点头，并且从旁向荣儿窥视。

“不是这里！不是这里！”小鸟啾唧着。

“你想着什么，约翰？”荣儿问。

“你不知道什么缘故么，荣儿？你不知道在那里寻觅这个么？你不等候着金匙儿么？”

“不，不！告诉我，这是怎的？”

约翰叙述出他所知道的关于小书的事来。

“而且我存着匙儿。我想，你有着金箧。不是这样的么，小鸟儿？”

但那小鸟却装作似乎没有听到，只在嫩的碧绿的山毛榉树的枝柯里翩跹。

他们坐在一个冈坡上，这地方生长着幼小的山毛榉和枞树。一条绿色的道路斜引上去，他们便坐在这些的边缘，在沙冈上，在繁密的浓绿的莓苔上。他们可以从最小的树木的梢头，望见绿色的海带着明明暗暗的着色的波浪。

“我已经相信了，约翰，”荣儿深思地说，“你在寻觅的，我能够给你觅得。但你怎么对付那匙儿呢？你怎么想到这里的呢？”

“是呵，这是怎的，这是怎么一回事呢？”约翰喃喃着，从树海上望着远方。

他们刚走出晴明的蔚蓝里，在他们的望中忽然浮起了两只白胡蝶。它们搅乱着，颤动着，而且在日光下闪烁着，无定地轻浮地飞舞。但它们却近来了。

“旋儿，旋儿！”约翰轻轻地说，蓦地沉在忆念里了。

“旋儿是谁？”荣儿问。

红膆鸟啾唧着飞了起来，约翰还觉得那就在他面前草里的雏菊们突然用了它们的大睁的白的小眼睛非常可怕地对他看。

“他给你那匙儿么？”女孩往下问——约翰点点头，沉默着，然而她还要知道得多一点——“这是谁呢？一切都是他教给你的么？他在那里呢？”

“现在是不再有他了。现在是荣儿，单是荣儿，只还有荣儿。”他捏住她的臂膊，靠上自己的头去。

“胡涂孩子！”她说，且笑着，“我要使你觅得那书儿——我知道，这在那里。”

“那我就得走，去取匙儿，那是很远呢。”

“不，不，这不必。我不用匙儿觅得它——明早，明早呵，我准许你。”

当他们回家时，胡蝶们在他们前面翩跹着。

约翰在那夜，梦见他的父亲，那一切都是好朋友，站在他周围，梦见荣儿，还梦见许多另外的。而且亲密地信任地对他看。但忽然面目都改变了，他们的眼光是寒冷而且讥嘲——他恐怖地四顾——到处是惨淡的仇视的面目。他感到一种无名的恐怖，并且哭着醒来了。





九


约翰坐得很长久，而且等候着。空气是冷冷的，大的云接近了地面，不断的无穷的连续着飘浮。它们展开了暗灰色的、波纹无际的氅衣，还在清朗的光中卷起它们的傲慢的峰头，即在那光中发亮。树上的日光和阴影变换得出奇地迅疾，如永有烈焰飞腾的火。约翰于是觉得恐惧了。他思索着那书儿，难于相信，而还希望着，他今天将要觅得。云的中间，很高，奇怪的高，他看见清朗的凝固的蔚蓝，那上面是和平地扩张在不动的宁静中的、柔嫩的、洁白的小云，精妙地蒙茸着。

“这得是这样，”他想，“这样高，这样明，这样静。”

于是荣儿来到了。然而红膆鸟却不同来。“正好，约翰，”她大声叫，“你可以来，并且看那书去。”

“红膆鸟在那里呢？”约翰迟疑着问。

“没有带来，我们并不是散步呵。”

他一同走，不住地暗想着：那是不能——那不能是这样的——一切都应该是另外的样子。

然而他跟随着在他前面放光的灿烂的金发。

唉！从此以后，小约翰就悲哀了。我希望他的故事在这里就完结。你可曾讨厌地梦见过一个魔幻的园，其中有着爱你而且和你谈天的花卉们和动物们的没有？于是你在梦里就有了那知觉，知道你就要醒来，并且将一切的华美都失掉了？于是你徒然费力于坚留它，而且你也不愿看那冰冷的晓色。

当他一同进去的时候，约翰就潜藏着这样的感觉。

他走到一所住房，那边一条进路，反响着他的脚步。他齅到衣服和食物的气味，他想到他该在家里时的悠长的日子——想到学校的功课，想到一切，凡是在他生活上幽暗而且冰冷的。

他到了一间有人的房间。人有几多，他没有看。他们在闲谈，但他一进去，便寂静了。他注视地毯，有着很大的不能有的花纹带些刺目的色彩。色彩都很特别和异样，正如家乡的在他小屋子里的一般。

“这是园丁孩子么？”一个正对着他的声音说，“进来就是，小朋友，你用不着害怕的。”

一个别的声音在他近旁突然发响：“唔，小荣，你有一个好宝贝儿哩。”

这都是什么意义呢？在约翰的乌黑的孩子眼上，又叠起深深的皱来，他并且惑乱地惊骇地四顾。

那边坐着一个穿黑衣的男人，用了冷冷的严厉的眼睛看着他。

“你要学习书中之书么？我很诧异，你的父亲，那园丁，那我以为是一个虔诚人的，竟还没有将这给了你。”

“他不是我的父亲——他远得很。”

“唔，那也一样。看罢，我的孩子！常常读着这一本，那就要到你的生活道上了……”

约翰却已认得了这书。他也不能这样地得到那一本，那应该是全然各别的。他摇摇头。

“不对，不对！这不是我所想的那一本。我知道，这不是那一本！”

他听到了惊讶的声音，他也觉得了从四面刺他的眼光。

“什么？你想着什么呢，小男人？”

“我知道那本书儿，那是人类的书。这本却是还不够，否则人类就安宁和太平了。这并不是。我想着的是一些各别的，人一看，谁也不能怀疑。那里面记着为什么一切是这样的，像现状的这样，又清楚，又分明。”

“这能么？这孩子的话是那里来的？”

“谁教你的，小朋友？”

“我相信，你看了邪书了，孩子，照它胡说出来罢。”

几个声音这样地发响，约翰觉得他面庞炽热起来——他快要晕眩了——房屋旋转着，地毯上的大花朵一上一下地飘浮。前些日子在学校里这样忠诚地劝戒他的小鼠在那里呢？他现在用得着它了。

“我没有照书胡说，那教给我的，也比你们全班的价值要高些。我知道花卉们和动物们的话，我是它们的亲信。我明白人类是什么，以及他们怎样地生活着。我知道妖精们和小鬼头们的一切秘密，因为它们比人类更爱我。”

约翰听得自己的周围和后面，有窃笑和喧笑。在他的耳朵里，吟唱并且骚鸣起来了。

“他像是读过安兑生(1)了。”

“他是不很了了的。”

正对着他的男人说：

“如果你知道安兑生，孩子，你就得多有些他对于上帝的敬畏和他的话。”

“上帝！”这个字他识得的，而且他想到旋儿的所说。

“我对于上帝没有敬畏。上帝是一盏大煤油灯，由此成千的迷误了，毁灭了。”

没有喧笑，却是可怕的沉静，其中混杂着嫌恶和惊怖。约翰在背上觉得钻刺的眼光。那是，就如在昨夜的他的梦里。

那黑衣男人立起身来，抓住了他的臂膊。他痛楚，而且几乎挫折了勇气。

“听着罢，我的孩子，我不知道，你是否不甚了了，还是全毁了——这样的毁谤上帝在我这里却不能容忍——滚出去，也不要再到我的眼前来，我说。懂么？”

一切的眼光是寒冷和仇视，就如在那一夜。

约翰恐怖地四顾。

“荣儿！——荣儿在那里？”

“是了，我的孩子要毁了！——你当心着，你永不准和她说话！”

“不，让我到她那里！我不愿意离开她。荣儿，荣儿！”约翰哭着。

她却恐怖地坐在屋角里，并不抬起眼来。

“滚开，你这坏种！你不听！你不配再来！”

而且那痛楚的紧握，带着他走过反响的路，玻璃门砰然阖上了——约翰站在外面的黑暗的低垂的云物下。他不再哭了，当他徐徐地前行的时候，沉静地凝视着前面。在他眼睛上面的阴郁的皱纹也更其深，而且永不失却了。

红膆鸟坐在一座菩提树林中，并且向他窥看。他静静地站住，沉默地报答以眼光。但在它胆怯的侦察的小眼睛里，已不再见信任，当他更近一步的时候，那敏捷的小动物便鼓翼而去了。

“走罢！走罢！一个人！”同坐在园路上的麻雀们啾唧着，并且四散地飞开。

盛开的花们也不再微笑，它们却严正而淡漠地凝视，就如对于一切的生人。

但约翰并不注意这些事，他只想着那人们给他的侮辱。在他是，仿佛有冰冷的坚硬的手，污了他的最深处了。“他们得相信我，”他想，“我要取我的匙儿，并且指示给他们。”

“约翰！约翰！”一个脆的小声音叫道。那地方有一个小窠在一株冬青树里，将知的大眼睛正从窠边上望出来，“你往那里去？”

“一切都是你的罪，将知！”约翰说，“让我安静着罢。”

“你怎么也同人类去说呢，人类是不懂你的呵。你为什么将这样的事情去讲给人类的？这真是呆气！”

“他们笑骂我，又给我痛楚。那都是下贱东西！我憎恶他们。”

“不然，约翰，你爱他们。”

“不然！不然！”

“他们不像你这样，于你就少一些痛苦了——他们的话，于你也就算不得什么了。对于人类，你须少介意一点。”

“我要我的匙儿。我要将这示给他们。”

“这你不必做，他们还是不信你的。这有什么用呢？”

“我要蔷薇丛下的我的匙儿。你知道怎么寻觅它么？”

“是呀！——在池边，是么？是的，我知道它。”

“那就带领我去罢，将知！”

将知腾上了约翰的眉头，告诉他道路。他们奔走了一整天——发风，有时下狂雨，但到晚上，云却平静了，并且伸成金色和灰色的长条。

他们来到约翰所认识的沙冈时，他的心情柔软了，他每次细语着：“旋儿，旋儿。”

这里是兔窟——以及沙冈，在这上面他曾经睡过一回的。灰色的鹿苔软而且湿，并不在他的脚下挫折作响。蔷薇开完了，黄色的月下香带着它们的迷醉的微香，成百地伸出花萼来。那长的傲兀的王烛花伸得更高，和它们的厚实的毛叶。

约翰细看那冈蔷薇的精细的淡褐色的枝柯。

“它在那里呢，将知？我看不见它。”

“那我不知道，”将知说，“是你藏了匙儿的，不是我。”

蔷薇曾经开过的地方，已是满是淡漠地向上望着的黄色的月下香的田野了。约翰询问它们，也问王烛。然而它们太傲慢，因为它们的长花是高过他——约翰还去问沙地上的三色地丁花。

却没有一个知道一点蔷薇的事。它们一切都是这一夏天的。不但那这么高的自负的王烛。

“唉，它在那里呢？它在那里呢？”

“那么，你也骗了我了？”将知说，“这我早想到，人类总是这样的。”

他从约翰的肩头溜下，在冈草间跑掉了。

约翰在绝望中四顾——那里站着一窠小小的冈蔷薇丛。

“那大蔷薇在那里呢？”约翰问，“那大的，那先前站在这里的？”

“我们不和人类说话。”那小丛说。这是他所听到的末一回——四围的一切生物都沉静地缄默了，只有芦叶在轻微的晚风中瑟瑟地作响。

“我是一个人么？”约翰想，“不，这不能是，不能是。我不愿意是人。我憎恶人类。”

他疲乏，他的精神也迟钝了。他坐在小草地边的、散布着湿而强烈的气息的、柔软的苍苔上。

“我不能回去了，我也不能再见荣儿了。我的匙儿在那里呢？旋儿在那里呢？为什么我也须离开荣儿呢？我不能缺掉她。如果少了她，我不会死么？我总须生活着，且是一个人——像其他的，那笑骂我的一个人么？”

于是他忽又看见那两个白胡蝶，那是从阳光方面向他飞来的。他紧张着跟在它们的飞舞之后，看它们是否指给他道路。它们在他的头上飞，彼此接近了，于是又分开了，在愉快的游戏中盘旋着。它们慢慢地离开阳光，终于飘过冈沿，到了树林里。那树林是只还有最高的尖，在从长的云列下面通红而鲜艳地闪射出来的夕照中发亮。

约翰跟定它们。但当它们飞过最前排的树木的时候，他便觉察出，怎样地有一个黑影追蹑着有声的鼓翼，并且将它们擒拿。一转瞬间，它们便消失了。那黑影却迅速地向他射过来，他恐怖地用手掩了脸。

“唉，小孩子！你为什么坐在这里哭？”帖近他响着一个锋利的嘲笑的声音。约翰先曾看见，像是一只大的黑蝙蝠奔向他，待到他抬头去看的时候，却站着一个黑的小男人，比他自己大得很有限。他有一个大头带着大耳朵，黑暗地翘在明朗的暮天中，瘦的身躯和细细的腿。从他脸上，约翰只看见细小的闪烁的眼睛。

“你失掉了一点什么么，小孩子？那我愿意帮你寻。”他说。

但约翰沉默着摇摇头。

“看罢，你要我的这个么？”他又开始了，并且摊开手。约翰在那上面看见一点白东西，时时动弹着。那便是白色的胡蝶儿，快要死了，颤动着撕破的和拗断的小翅子。约翰觉到一个寒栗，似乎有人从后面在吹他，并且恐惧地仰看那奇特的家伙。“你是谁？”他问。

“你要知道我的名字么，小孩子？那么，你就只称我穿凿(2)，简直穿凿。我虽然还有较美的名字，然而你是不懂的。”

“你是一个人么？”

“听罢！我有着臂膊和腿和一个头——看看是怎样的一个头罢！——那孩子却问我，我是否一个人哩！但是，约翰，约翰！”那小男人还用咿咿哑哑的声音笑起来。

“你怎么知道我是谁呢？”约翰问。

“唉，这在我是容易的。我知道的还多得很。我也知道你从那里来以及你在这里做什么。我知道得怪气的多，几乎一切。”

“唉，穿凿先生……”

“穿凿，穿凿，不要客气。”

“你可也知道……？”但约翰骤然沉默了，“他是一个人。”他想。

“你想你的匙儿罢？一定是！”

“我却自己想着，人类是不能知道那个的。”

“胡涂孩子！将知已经泄漏了很多了。”

“那么你也和将知认识的？”

“呵，是的！他是我的最好的朋友之一——这样的我还很多。但这却不用将知我早知道了。我所知道的比将知还要广。一个好小子，然而胡涂，出格地胡涂。我不然！全不然。”穿凿并且用了瘦小的手，自慰地敲他的大头。

“你知道么，约翰，”他说下去，“什么是将知的大缺点？但你千万永不可告诉他，否则他要大大地恼怒的。”

“那么，是什么呢？”约翰问。

“他完全不存在。这是一个大缺点，他却不肯赞成，而且他还说过我，我是不存在的。然而那是他说诳。我是否在这里！还有一千回！”

穿凿将胡蝶塞在衣袋里，并且突然在约翰面前倒立起来。于是他可厌地装着怪相笑，还吐出一条长长的舌头。约翰是，时当傍晚，和这样的一个奇特东西在沙冈上，心情本已愁惨了的，现在却因恐怖而发抖了。

“观察世界，这是一个很适宜的方法，”穿凿说，还总是倒立着。“如果你愿意，我也肯教给你。看一切都更清楚，更自然。”

他还将那细腿在空中开合着，并且用手向四面旋转。当红色的夕光落在颠倒的脸上时，约翰觉得这很可厌——小眼睛在光中瞟着，还露出寻常看不见的眼白来。

“你看，这样是云彩如地面，而这地有如世界的屋顶。相反也一样地很可以站得住的。既没有上，也没有下。云那里许是一片更美的游步场。”

约翰仰视那连绵的云。他想，这颇像有着涌血的红畦的生翼的田野。在海上，灿烂着云的洞府的高门。

“人能够到那里去，并且进去么？”他问。

“无意识！”穿凿说，而使约翰很安心的，是忽然又用两脚来站立了。“无意识！倘你在那里，那完全同这里一模一样——那就许是仿佛那华美再远一点儿。在那美丽的云里，是冥蒙的，灰色而且寒冷的。”

“我不信你，”约翰说，“我这才看清楚，你是一个人。”

“去罢！你不信我，可爱的孩子，因为我是一个人么？而你——你或者是别的什么么？”

“唉，穿凿，我也是一个人么？”

“你怎么想，一个妖精么？妖精们是不被爱的。”穿凿便交叉着腿坐在约翰的面前，而且含着怪笑目不转睛地对他看。约翰在这眼光之下，觉得不可名言地失措和不安，想要潜藏或隐去。然而他不复能够转眼了。“只有人类被爱，约翰，你听着！而且这是完全正当的，否则他们也许早已不存在了。你虽然还太年青，却一直被爱到耳朵之上。你正想着谁呢？”

“想荣儿。”约翰小声说，几乎听不见地。

“你对谁最仰慕呢？”

“对荣儿。”

“你以为没有谁便不能生活呢？”

约翰的嘴唇轻轻地说，“荣儿。”

“唉，哪，小子，”穿凿忍着笑，“你怎么自己想象，是一个妖精呢？妖们是并不痴爱人类的孩子的。”

“然而她是旋儿……”约翰在慌张中含胡地说。

于是穿凿便嫌忌地做作地注视，并且用他骨立的手捏住了约翰的耳朵。“这是怎样的无意识呢？你要用那蠢物来吓我么？他比将知还胡涂得远——胡涂得远。他一点不懂。那最坏的是，他其实就没有存在着，而且也没有存在过。只有我存在着，你懂么？——如果你不信我，我就要使你觉得，我就在这里。”

他还用力摇撼那可怜的约翰的耳朵。约翰叫道：“我却认识他很长久，还和他巡游得很远的！”

“你做了梦，我说。你的蔷薇丛和你的匙儿在那里呢，说？——但你现在不要做梦了，你明白么？”

“噢！”约翰叫喊，因为穿凿在掐他。

天已经昏黑了，蝙蝠在他们的头边纷飞，还叫得刺耳。天空是黑而且重——没有一片叶在树林里作声。

“我可以回家去么？”约翰恳求着。“向我的父亲？”

“你的父亲？你要在那里做什么？”穿凿问。“在你这样久远地出外之后，人将亲爱地对你叫欢迎。”

“我念家。”约翰说，他一面想着那明亮地照耀着的住室，他在那里常常挨近他父亲坐，并且倾听着他的笔锋声的。那里平和而且舒畅。

“是呵，因为爱那并不存在的蠢才，你就无须走开和出外了。现在已经太迟。而这也不算什么，我早就要照管你了。我来做呢，或是你的父亲来做呢，本来总归是一件事。这样的一个父亲却不过是想象。你大概是为自己选定了他的罢？你以为再没有一个别的，会一样好，一样明白的么？我就一样好，而且明白得多，明白得多。”

约翰没有勇气回答了。他合了眼，疲乏地点头。

“而且对于这荣儿，你也不必寻觅了。”穿凿接下去。他将手放在约翰的肩头，紧接着他的耳朵说：“那孩子也如别个一样，领你去上痴子索。当人们笑骂你的时候，你没有见她怎样地坐在屋角里，而且一句话也不说么？她并不比别人好。她看得你好，同你游嬉，就正如她和一个金虫玩耍。你的走开与否，她不在意，她也毫不知道那书儿。然而我却是——我知道那书在那里，还要带你去寻觅。我几乎知道一切。”

约翰相信他起来了。

“你同我去么？你愿意同我寻觅么？”

“我很困倦，”约翰说，“给我在无论什么地方睡觉罢。”

“我向来不喜欢这睡觉，”穿凿说，“这一层我是太活泼了。一个人应该永远醒着，并且思想着。但我要给你安静一会儿——明晨见！”

于是他做出友爱的姿态，这是他刚才懂得做法的。约翰凝视着闪烁的小眼睛，直至他此外一无所见。他的头沉重了，他倚在生苔的冈坡上。似乎那小眼睛越闪越远，后来就像星星在黑暗的天空。他仿佛听到远处的声音发响，地面也从他底下远远地离开……于是他的思想停止了。

十


当他有些微知觉，觉得在他的睡眠中起了一点特别事情的时候，他还没有完全醒过来。但他不希望知道，也不愿意四顾。他要再回到宛如懒散的烟雾，正在徐徐消失着的那梦中——其中是荣儿又来访他了，而且一如从前，抚摩他的头发——其中他又曾在有池的园子里，看见了他的父亲和普烈斯多。

“噢！这好痛！是谁干的？”约翰睁开眼，在黎明中，他就在左近看见一个小小的形体，还觉出一只正在拉他头发的手来。他躺在床上，晨光微薄而平均，如在一间屋子里。

然而那俯向着他的脸，却将他昨日的一切困苦和一切忧郁都叫醒了。这是穿凿的脸，鬼样较少，人样较多，但还如昨晚一样的可憎和可怕。

“唉，不！让我做梦。”他恳求道。

然而穿凿摇撼他：“你疯了么，懒货？梦是痴呆，你在那里走不通的。人须工作，思想，寻觅——因此，他才是一个人！”

“我情愿不是人，我要做梦！”

“那你就无法可救。你应该，现在你在我的守护之下了，你须和我一同工作并且思想。只有和我，你能够觅得你所希望的东西。而且直到觅得了那个为止，我也不愿意离开你。”

约翰从这外观上，感到了无限的忧惧。然而他却仿佛被一种不能抵御的威力，压制和强迫了。他不知不觉地降伏了。

冈阜、树木和花卉是过去了。他在一间狭窄的微明的小屋里——他望见外面，凡目力所及，是房屋又房屋，作成长长的一式的排列，黯淡而且模胡。

烟气到处升作沉重的环，并且淡棕色雾似的，降到街道上。街上是人们忙乱地往来，正如大的黑色的蚂蚁。骚乱的轰闹，混沌而不绝地从那人堆里升腾起来。

“看呀，约翰！”穿凿说，“这岂不有点好看么？这就是一切人们和一切房子们，一如你所望见的那样远——比那蓝的塔还远些——也满是人们，从底下塞到上面。这不值得注意么？比起蚂蚁堆来，这是完全两样的。”

约翰怀着恐怖的好奇心倾听，似乎人示给了他一条伟大的可怕的大怪物。他仿佛就站在这大怪物的背上，又仿佛看见黑血在厚的血管中流过，以及昏暗的呼吸从百数鼻孔里升腾。当那骇人的声音将要兆凶的怒吼之前，就使他恐怖。

“看哪，人们都怎样地跑着呵，约翰，”穿凿往下说，“你可以看出，他们有所奔忙，并且有所寻觅，对不对？那却好玩，他自己正在寻觅什么，却谁都不大知道。倘若他们寻觅了一会儿，他们便遇见一个谁，那名叫永终的……”

“那是什么人呢？”约翰问。

“我的好相识之一，我早要给他绍介你了。那永终便说：‘你在寻觅我么？’大多数大概回答道：‘阿，不，我没有想到你！’但永终却又反驳道：‘除了我，你却不能觅得别的。’于是他们就只得和永终满足了。”

约翰懂得，他是说着死。

“而且这永是，永是这么下去么？”

“一定，永是。然而每日又来一堆新的人，即刻又寻觅起来，不知道为什么，而寻觅又寻觅，直到他们终于觅得永终——这已经这样地经过了好一会儿了，也还要这样地经过好一会儿的。”

“我也觅不到别的东西么，穿凿，除了……”

“是呵，永终是你一定会觅得一回的，然而这不算什么。只是寻觅罢！不断地寻觅！”

“但是那书儿，穿凿，你曾要使我觅得的那书儿。”

“唔，谁知道呢！我没有说谎。我们应该寻觅，寻觅。我们寻觅什么，我们还知道得很少。这是将知教给我们的。也有这样的人，他们一生中寻觅着，只为要知道他们正在寻觅着什么——这是哲学家。约翰。然而倘若永终一到，那也就和他们的寻觅都去了。”

“这可怕，穿凿！”

“阿，不然，全不然。永终是一个实在忠厚的人。他被看错了。”

有人在门前的梯子上踬着脚。橐橐！橐橐！在木梯上面响。于是有人叩门了，仿佛是铁敲着木似的。

一个长的，瘦的男人进来了。他有深陷的眼睛和长而瘦的手。一阵冷风透过了那小屋。

“哦，这样！”穿凿说，“你来了，坐下罢！我们正谈到你。你好么？”

“工作！许多工作！”那长人说，一面拭着自己的冒出的灰白的额上的冷汗。

不动而胆怯的约翰看着那僵视着他的深陷的眼睛。眼睛是严正而且黑暗，然而并不残忍，也无敌意。几瞬息之后，他又呼吸得较为自由，他的心也跳得不大剧烈了。

“这是约翰，”穿凿说，“他曾经听说有那么一本书儿，里面记着，为什么一切是这样，像这似的，而且我们还要一同去寻觅，是么？”穿凿一面别有许多用意地微笑着。

“唉，这样，唔，这是正当的！”死亲爱地说，且向约翰点头。

“他怕觅不到那个呢——但我告诉他，他首先须要实在勤恳地寻觅。”

“诚然，”死说，“勤恳地寻觅那是正当的。”

“他以为你许是很残忍。但你看罢，约翰，你错了，对不对？”

“唉，是呵！”死亲爱地说，“人说我许多坏处。我没有胜人的外观，但我以为这也还好。”

他疲乏地微笑，如一个忙碌于一件正在议论的严重事情的人。于是他的黑暗的眼光从约翰弯到远方，并且在大都市上沉思地恍忽着。

约翰长久不敢说话，终于他低声说：

“你现在要带着我么？”

“你想什么，我的孩子？”死说，从他的梦幻中仰视着，“不，现在还不。你应该长大，且成一个好人。”

“我不愿意是一个人，如同其他那样的。”

“去罢，去罢！”死说，“这无从办起。”

人可以听出他来，这是他的一种常用的语气。他接续着：

“人怎地能成一个好人，我的朋友穿凿可以教你的。这也有各样的方法，但穿凿教得最出色。成一个好人，实在是很好看、很值得期望的事。你不可以低廉地估计它，年青小子！”

“寻觅，思想，观察。”穿凿说。

“诚然，诚然，”死说——于是对着穿凿道：“你想领他到谁那里去呢？”

“到号码博士那里，我的老学生。”

“唉，是呀，那是一个好学生，人的模范。在他这一类里，几乎完备了。”

“我会再见荣儿么？”约翰抖着问。

“那孩子想谁呀？”死问。

“唉，他曾经被爱了，至今还在幻想成一个妖精，嘻嘻嘻。”穿凿阴险地微笑着。

“不然，我的孩子，这不相干，”死说，“这样的事情，你在号码博士那里便没有了。谁要寻觅你所寻觅的，他应该将所有别的都忘掉。一切或全无。”(1)

“我要以一铸将他造成一个人，我要指示他什么是恋爱，他就早要想穿了。”

穿凿又复高兴地笑起来——死又将他的黑眼睛放在可怜的约翰上，那竭力忍住他的呜咽的。因为他在死面前羞愧。

死骤然起立。“我应该去了，”他说，“我谈过了我的时间。这里还有许多事情做。好天，约翰，我们要再见了。你只不可在我面前有害怕。”

“我在你面前没有害怕——我情愿你带着我。请！带我去罢！”

死却温和地拒绝了他，这一类的请求，他是听惯了的。

“不，约翰，你现在去工作，寻觅和观察罢。不要再请求我。我只招呼一次，而且够是时候的。”

他一消失，穿凿又完全恣肆了。他跳过椅子，顺着地面滑走，爬上柜子和烟突去，还在开着的窗间，耍出许多可以折断颈子的技艺。

“这就是那永终呵，我的好朋友永终！”他大声说，“你看不出他好来么？他确也见得有点儿可憎，面且很阴惨。但倘在他的工作上有了他的欢喜，他也能很高兴的，然而这工作常常使他无聊。这事也单调一点。”

“他该到那里去，是谁告诉他的呢，穿凿？”

穿凿猜疑地，侦察地用一目斜睨着约翰。

“你为什么问这个？他走他自己的路。他一得来，他就带着。”

后来，约翰别有见地了。但现在他却没有知道得更分明，且相信穿凿所说的总该是真实的。

他们在街道上走，辗转着穿过蠕动的人堆。黑色的人们交错奔波着，笑着，喋喋着，显得这样地高兴而且无愁，不免使约翰诧异。他看见穿凿向许多人们点头，却没有一个人回礼，大家都看着自己的前面，仿佛他们一无所见似的。

“现在他们走着，笑着，似乎他们之中没有一个认识我。但这不过是景象。倘或我单独和他们在一处，他们就不再能够否认我，而且他们也就失却了兴趣了。”

在路上，约翰觉得有人跟在他后面走。他一回顾，他看出是那用了不可闻的大踏步，在人们中间往来的，长的苍白的人。他向约翰点头。

“人们也看见他么？”约翰问穿凿。

“一定，他们个个，然而他们连他也不愿意认识。唔，我喜欢让他们高傲。”

那混乱和喧闹使约翰昏聩了，这即刻又使他忘却了他的忧愁。狭窄的街道和将天的蔚蓝分成长条的高的房屋，沿屋走着的人们，脚步的橐橐和车子的隆隆，扰乱了那夜的旧的幻觉和梦境，正如暴风之于水镜上的影象一般。这在他，仿佛是人们之外更无别物存在——仿佛他应该在无休无歇的绝息的扰乱里，一同做，一同跑。

于是他们到了沉静的都市的一部分，那地方站着一所大房屋，有着大而素朴的窗门。这显得无情而且严厉。里面是静静的，约翰还觉到一种不熟悉的刺鼻的气味夹着钝浊的地窖气作为底子的混合。一间小屋，里面是奇异的家具，还坐着一个孤寂的人。他被许多书籍、玻璃杯和铜的器具围绕着，那些也都是约翰所不熟悉的。一道寂寞的日光从他头上照入屋中，并且在盛着美色液体的玻璃杯间闪烁。那人努力地在一个黄铜管里注视，也并不抬头。

当约翰走得较近时，他听到他怎样地喃喃着：

“将知！将知！”

那人旁边，在一个长的黑架子上，躺着一点他所不很能够辨别的白东西。

“好早晨，博士先生。”穿凿说，然而那博士还是不抬头。

于是约翰吃惊了，因为他在竭力探视的那白东西，突然起了痉挛的颤抖的运动。他所见的是一只兔身上的白茸皮。有那动着的鼻子的小头，向下缚在铁架上，四条腿是在身上紧紧地绑起来。那想要摆脱的绝望的试验，只经过了一瞬息，这小动物便又静静地躺着了，只是那流血的颈子的急速的颤动，还在显示它没有死。

约翰还看见那圆圆的仁厚的眼睛，圆睁在它的无力的恐怖中，并且他仿佛有些熟识。唉，当那最初的有幸的妖夜里，在这柔软的，而现在是带着急速的恐怖的喘息而颤动着的小身体上，他曾经枕过自己的头。他的过去生活的一切记念，用了威力逼起他来了。他并不想，他却直闯到那小动物面前去：

“等一等！等一等！可怜的小鬼，我要帮助你。”他并且急急地想解开那紧缚着嫩脚的绳子来。

但他的手同时也被紧紧地捏住了，耳边还响着尖利的笑声。

“这是什么意思，约翰？你还是这样孩子气么？那博士对你得怎样想呢？”

“那孩子要怎样？他在这里干什么？”那博士惊讶地问。

“他要成一个人，因此我带他到你这里来的。然而他还太小，也太孩子气。要寻觅你所寻觅的，这样可不是那条路呵，约翰！”

“是的，那样的路不是那正当的。”博士说。

“博士先生，放掉那小兔罢！”

穿凿掐住了他的两手，至使他发起抖来。

“我们怎样约定的，小孩子？”他向他附耳说，“我们须寻觅，是不是？我们在这里并非在沙冈上旋儿身边和无理性的畜类里面。我们要是人类——人类！你懂得么？倘或你愿意止于一个小孩子，倘或你不够强，来帮助我，我就使你走，那就独自去寻觅！”

约翰默然，并且相信了，他愿意强。他闭了眼睛，想看不见那小兔。

“可爱的孩子！”博士说，“你在开初似乎还有一点仁厚，那是的确，第一回是看去很有些不舒服的。我本身就永不愿意看，我只要能避开就避开。然而这是不能免的，你还应该懂得：我们正是人类而非动物，而且人类的和科学的尊荣，是远出于几匹小兔的尊荣之上的。”

“你听到么？”穿凿说，“科学和人类！”

“科学的人，”博士接着说，“高于一切此外的人们。然而他也就应该将平常人的小感触，为了那大事业、科学，作为牺牲。你愿意做一个这样的人么？你觉得这是你的本分么，我的小孩子？”

约翰迟疑着，他不大懂得“本分”这一个词，正如那金虫一样。

“我要觅得那书儿，”他说，“那将知说过的。”

博士惊讶了，并且问：“将知？”

但穿凿却迅速地说道：“他要这个，博士，我很明白的。他要寻觅那最高的智慧，他要给万有立一个根基。”

约翰点头。“是的！”他对于这话所懂得的那些，即是他的目的。

“唉，那你就应该强，约翰，不要小气以及软心。那么我就要帮助你了。然而你打算打算罢：一切或全无。”

于是约翰用发抖的手，又将那解开的绳帮同捆在小兔的四爪上。

十一


“我们要试一试，”穿凿说，“我可能旋儿似的示给你许多美。”

他们向博士告了别，且约定当即回来之后，他便领着约翰到大城的一切角落巡行，他指示它，这大怪物怎样地生活，呼吸和滋养，它怎样地吸收自己并且从自己重行生长起来。

但他偏爱这人们紧挤着，一切灰色而干枯、空气沉重而潮湿的、阴郁的困苦区域。

他领他走进大建筑中之一，烟气从那里面升腾，这是约翰第一天就见过的。那地方主宰着一个震聋耳朵的喧闹——到处鸣吼着，格磔着，撞击着，隆隆着——大的轮子嗡嗡有声，长带蜿蜒着拖过去，黑的是墙和地面，窗玻璃破碎或则尘昏。雄伟的烟突高高地伸起，超过黑的建筑物，还喷出浓厚的旋转的烟柱来。在这轮子和机器的杂沓中，约翰看见无数人们带着苍白的脸、黑的手和衣服，默默地不住地工作着。

“这是什么？”他问。

“轮子，也是轮子，”穿凿笑着，“如果你愿意，也可以说是人。他们经营着什么，他们便终年的经营，一天又一天。在这种样子上，人也能是一个人？”

他们走到污秽的巷中，天的蔚蓝的条，见得狭如一指，还被悬挂出来的衣服遮暗了。人们在那里蠢动着，他们互相挨挤，叫喊，喧笑，有时也还唱歌。房屋里是小屋子，这样小，这样黑暗而且昏沉，至使约翰不大敢呼吸。他看见在赤地上爬着的相打的孩子，蓬着头发给消瘦的乳儿哼着小曲的年青姑娘。他听到争闹和呵斥，凡在他周围的一切面目，也显得疲乏、鲁钝或漠不相关。

无名的苦痛侵入约翰了。这和他现以为愧的先前的苦痛，是不一样的。

“穿凿，”他问，“在这里活着的人们，永是这么苦恼和艰难么？也比我……”他不敢接下去了。

“固然，而他们称这为幸福。他们活得全不艰难，他们已经习惯，也不知道别的了。那是一匹胡涂的不识好歹的畜生。看那两个坐在她门口的女人罢。她们满足地眺望着污秽的巷，正如你先前眺望你的沙冈。为这人们你无须颦蹙，否则你也须为那永不看见日光的土拨鼠颦蹙了。”

约翰不知道回答，也不知道为什么他却还要哭。

而且在喧扰的操作和旋转中间，他总看见那苍白的空眼的人，怎样地用了无声的脚步走动。

“总而言之统而言之是一个好人，对不对？他从这里将人们带走。但这里他们也一样地怕他。”

已经是深夜，小光的百数在风中动摇，并且将长的波动的影象投到黑暗的水上的时候，这两个顺着寂静的街道趱行。古旧的高的房屋似乎因为疲劳，互相倚靠起来，并且睡着了。大部分已经合了眼。有几处却还有一个窗户透出黯淡的黄光。

穿凿给约翰讲那住在后面的许多故事，讲到在那里受着的苦楚，讲到在那里争斗着的困苦和生趣之间的争斗。他不给它省去最阴郁的，还偏爱选取最下贱和最难堪的事，倘若约翰因为他的惨酷的叙述而失色，沉默了，他便愉快得歪着嘴笑。

“穿凿，”约翰忽然问，“你知道一点那大光么？”

他以为这问题可以将他从沉重而可怕地压迫着他的幽暗里解放出来。

“空话！旋儿的空话！”穿凿说，“幻想和梦境。人们和我自己之外，没有东西。你以为有一个上帝或相类的东西，乐于在这里似的地上来主宰这样的废物们么？而且这样的大光，也决不在这黑暗里放出这许多来的。”

“还有星星们呢，星星们？”约翰问，似乎他希望这分明的伟大，能够来抬高他面前的卑贱。

“那星星们么？你可知道你说了什么了，小孩子？那上面并不是小光，像你在这里四面看见的灯烛似的。那一切都是世界们，比起这带着千数的城镇的世界来，都大得多。我们就如一粒微尘，在它们之间飘浮着，而且那是既无所谓上，也无所谓下，到处都有世界们，永是世界们，而且这是永没，永没有穷尽。”

“不然！不然！”约翰恐惧地叫喊，“不要说这个，不要说这个罢！在广大的黑暗的田野上，我看见小光们在我上面。”

“是呀，你看去不过是小光们。你也向上面呆望一辈子，只能看见黑暗的田野里在你上面的小光们。然而你能，你应该知道，那是世界们，既无上，也无下，在那里，那球儿是带着那些什么都不算，并且不算什么地消失了去的，可怜的蠕动着的人堆儿。那么，就不要向我再说‘星星们’了，仿佛那是二三十个似的，这是无意识。”

约翰沉默着。这会将卑贱提高的伟大，将卑贱压碎了。

“来罢，”穿凿说，“我们要看一点有趣的。”对他们传来了可爱的响亮的音乐。在黑暗的街道之一角，立着一所高大的房屋，从许多高窗内，明朗地透出些光辉。前面停着一大排车。马匹的顿足，空洞地在夜静中发响，它们的头还点着哦！哦！闪光在车件的银钉上和车子的漆光上闪烁。

里面是明亮的光。约翰半被迷眩地看着百数抖着的火焰的、夺目的、颜色的镜子和花的光彩。鲜明的姿态溜过窗前，他们都用了微笑的仪容和友爱的态度互相亲近着。直到大厅的最后面，都转动着盛装的人们，或是舒徐的步伐，或是迅速的旋风一般的回旋。那大声的喧嚣和欢喜的声音，摩擦的脚步和的长衣，都夹在约翰曾在远处听到过的柔媚的音乐的悠扬中，成为一个交错，传到街道上。在外面，接近窗边，是两个黑暗的形体，只有那面目，被他们正在贪看的光耀照得不一律而且鲜明。

“这美呵！这堂皇呵！”约翰叫喊。他耽溺于这么多的色采、光辉和花朵的观览了。“出了什么事？我们可以进去么？”

“哦，这你却称为美呀？或者你也许先选一个兔洞罢？但是看罢？人们怎样地微笑、辉煌，并且鞠躬呵。看哪，男人们怎么这样地体面和漂亮，女人们怎么这样地艳丽和打扮呵。跳舞起来又多么郑重，像是世界上的最重要事件似的！”

约翰回想到兔洞里的跳舞，也看出了几样使他记忆起来的事。然而这却一切盛大得远，灿烂得远了。那些盛装的年青女子们，倘若伸高了她们的长的洁白的臂膊，当活泼的跳舞中侧着脸，他看来也美得正如妖精一般。侍役们是整肃地往来，并且用了恭敬的鞠躬，献上那贵重的饮料。

“多么华美！多么华美！”约翰大声说。

“很美观，你不这样想么？”穿凿说，“但你也须比在你鼻子跟前的看得远一点。你现在只看见可爱的微笑的脸，是不是？唔，这微笑，大部分却是诓骗和作伪呵。那坐在厅壁下的和蔼的老太太们就如围着池子的渔人，年青的女人们是钓饵，先生们是那鱼。他们虽然这么亲爱地一同闲谈——他们却嫉妒地不乐意于各人的钓得。倘若其中的一个年青女人高兴了，那是因为她穿得比别人美，或者招致的先生们比别人多，而先生们的特别的享乐是精光的脖子和臂膊。在一切微笑的眼睛和亲爱的嘴唇之后，藏着的全是另外一件事。而且那恭敬的侍役们，思想得全不恭敬。倘将他们正在想着的事骤然泄露出来，那就即刻和这美观的盛会都完了。”

当穿凿将一切指给他的时候，约翰便分明地看见仪容和态度中的作伪，以及从微笑的假面里怎样地露出虚浮、嫉妒和无聊，或则倘将这假面暂置一旁，便忽然见了分晓。

“唉，”穿凿说，“应该让他们随意。人们也应该高兴高兴。用别样的方法，他们是全不懂得的。”

约翰觉得，仿佛有人站在他后面似的。他向后看。那是熟识的、长的形体。苍白的脸被夺目的光彩所照耀，至使眼睛形成了两个大黑点。他低声自己喃喃着，还用手指直指向华美的厅中。

“看呵！”穿凿说，“他又在寻出来了。”

约翰向那手指所指的处所看。他看见一个年老的太太怎样地在交谈中骤然合了眼，以及美丽的年青的姑娘怎样地打一个寒噤，因此站住并且凝视着前方。

“到什么时候呢？”穿凿问死。

“这是我的事。”死说。

“我还要将这一样的社会给约翰看一回，”穿凿说。他于是歪着嘴笑而且起眼睛来。“可以么？”

“今天晚上么？”死问。

“为什么不呢？”穿凿说。“那地方既无时间，又无时候。现在是，凡有永是如此的，以及凡有将要如此的，已经永在那里了。”

“我不能同去，”死说，“我有太多的工作。然而用了那名字，叫我们俩所认识的那个罢，而且没有我，你们也可以觅得道路的。”

于是他们穿过寂寞的街，走了一段路，煤气灯焰在夜风中闪烁，黑暗的寒冷的水拍着河堤。柔媚的音乐逐渐低微，终于在横亘大都市上的大安静里绝响了。

忽然从高处发出一种全是金属的声音，一片清朗而严肃的歌曲。

这都从高的塔里蓦地落到沉睡的都市上——到小约翰的沉郁昏暗的魂灵上。他惊异着向上看。那钟声挟了欢呼着升腾起来，而强有力地撕裂了死寂的、响亮的调子悠然而去了。这在沉静的睡眠和黑暗的悲戚中间的高兴的声音、典礼的歌唱，他听得很生疏。

“这是时钟，”穿凿说，“这永是这样地高兴，一年去，一年来。每一小时，他总用了同等的气力和兴致唱那同一的歌曲。在夜里，就比白天响得更有趣——似乎是钟在欢呼它的无须睡觉，它下面是千数的忧愁和啼哭，而它却能够接续着一样地幸福地歌吟。然而倘若有谁死掉了，它便更其有趣地发响。”

又升腾了一次欢呼的声音。

“有一天，约翰，”穿凿接续着，“在一间寂静的屋子中的窗后面，将照着一颗微弱的小光。是一颗沉思着发抖，且使墙上的影子跳舞的、沉郁的小光。除了低微的梗塞的呜咽之外，屋子里更无声音作响。其中站着一张白幔的床，还有打皱的阴影。床上躺着一点东西，也是白而且静。这将是小约翰了。——阿，于是这歌便高声地高兴地响进屋里来，而且在歌声中，在他死后的最初时间中行礼。”

十二下沉重的敲打，迟延着在空中吼动了。当末一击时，约翰仿佛便如入梦，他不再走动了，在街道上飘浮了一段，凭着穿凿的手的提携。在火速的飞行中，房屋和街灯都从旁溜过去了。死消失了。现在是房屋较为稀疏。它们排成简单的行列，其间是黑暗的满是秘密的洞穴，有沟，有水洼，有废址和木料，偶然照着煤气的灯光。终于来了一个大的门带着沉重的柱子和高的栅栏。一刹那间他们便飘浮过去，并且落在大沙堆旁的湿草上了。约翰以为在一个园子里了，因为他听得周围有树木瑟瑟地响。

“那么，留神罢，约翰！还要以为我知道得比旋儿不更多。”

于是穿凿用了大声喊出一个短而黑暗的、使约翰战栗的名字来。幽暗从各方面反应这声响，风以呼啸的旋转举起它，直到它在高天中绝响。

约翰看见，野草怎样地高到他的头，而刚才还在他脚下的小石子，怎样地已将他的眺望遮住了。穿凿，在他旁边，也同他一样小，用两手抓住那小石，使出全身的力量在转它。细而高的声音的一种纷乱的叫唤，从荒芜了的地面腾起。

“喂，谁在这里？这是什么意思？野东西！”这即刻发作了。

约翰看见黑色的形相忙乱着穿插奔跑。他认识那敏捷的黑色的马陆虫，发光的棕色的蠼螋带着它的细巧的铗子，鼠妇虫有着圆背脊，以及蛇一流的蜈蚣。其中有一条长的蚯蚓，电一般快缩回它的洞里去了。

穿凿斜穿过这活动的吵闹的群，走向蚯蚓的洞口。

“喂，你这长的裸体的坏种！出来，带着你的红的尖鼻子。”穿凿大声说。

“得怎样呢？”那虫从深处问。

“你得出来，因为我要进去，你懂么，精光的嚼沙者！”

蚯蚓四顾着从洞口伸出它的尖头来，又向各处触探几回，这才慢慢地将那长的裸露的身子稍稍拖近地面去。

穿凿遍看那些因为好奇而奔集的别的动物。

“你们里面的一个得同去，并且在我们前面照着亮。不，黑马陆，你太胖，而且你带着你的千数条爪子会使我头昏眼花。喂，你，蠼螋！你的外观中我的意，同走，并且在你的铗子上带着光！马陆，跑，去寻一个迷光，或者给我拿一个烂木头的小灯来！”

他的出令的声音挥动了动物们，它们奉行了。

他们走下虫路去。他们前面是蠼螋带着发光的木头，于是穿凿，于是约翰。那下面是狭窄而黑暗。约翰看见沙粒微弱地照在淡薄的蓝色的微光中。沙粒都显得石一般大，半透明，由蚯蚓的身子磨成紧密的光滑的墙了。蚯蚓是好奇地跟随着。约翰向后看，只见它的尖头有时前伸，有时却等待着它的身子的拖近。

他们沉默着往下——长而且深。在约翰过于峻峭的路，穿凿便搀扶他。那似乎没有穷尽，永是新的沙粒，永是那蠼螋接着向下爬，随着道路的转弯，转着绕着。终于道路宽一点了，墙壁也彼此离远了。沙粒是黑而且潮，在上面成为一个轩洞，洞面有水点引成光亮的条痕，树根穿入轩洞中，像僵了的蛇一样。

于是在约翰的眼前忽然竖着一道挺直的墙，黑而高，将他们之前的全空间都遮断了。蠼螋转了过来。

“好！那就同到了后面了。蚯蚓已经知道。这是它的家。”

“来，指给我们路！”穿凿说。

蚯蚓慢慢地将那环节的身子拖到黑墙根，并且触探着。约翰看出，墙是木头。到处散落成淡棕色的尘土了。那虫便往里钻，将长的柔软的身子滑过孔穴去。

“那么，你。”穿凿说，便将约翰推进那小的潮湿的孔里。一刹那间，他在软而湿的尘芥里吓得要气绝了，于是他觉得他的头已经自由，并且竭全力将自己从那小孔中弄出。周围似乎是一片大空间。地面硬且潮，空气浓厚而且不可忍受地郁闷。约翰几乎不敢呼吸，只在无名的恐怖中等待着。

他听到穿凿的声音空洞地发响，如在一个地窖里似的。

“这里，约翰，跟着我！”

他觉得，他前面的地，怎样地隆起成山——由穿凿引导着，他在浓密的幽暗中踏着这地面。他似乎走在一件衣服上，这随着脚步而高低。他在沟洼和丘冈上磕碰着，其时他追随着穿凿，直到一处平地上，紧紧地抓住了一枝长的梗，像是柔软的管子。

“我们站在这里好！灯来！”穿凿叫喊。

于是从远处显出微弱的小光，和那拿着的虫一同低昂着。光移得越近，惨淡的光亮照得空间越满，约翰的窘迫便也越大了。

他踏过的那山，是长而且白，捏在他手里的管子，是棕色的，还向下引成灿烂的波线。

他辨出一个人的颀长僵直的身体，以及他所立的冰冷的地方，是前额。

他面前就现出两个深的黑洞，是陷下的眼睛，那淡蓝的光还照出瘦削的鼻子和那灰色的、因了怖人的僵硬的死笑而张开的唇吻。

从穿凿的嘴里发一声尖利的笑，这又即刻在潮湿的木壁间断气了。

“这是一个惊奇，约翰！”

那长的虫从尸衣的折叠间爬出。它四顾着，将自己拖到下颚上，经过僵直的嘴唇，滑进那乌黑的嘴洞里去了。

“这就是跳舞会中的最美的——你以为比妖精还美的。那时候，她的衣服和蜷发喷溢着甜香，那时候，眼睛是流盼而口唇是微笑——现在固然是变了一点了。”

在他所有的震慑中，约翰的眼里却藏着不信。这样快么？——方才是那么华美，而现在却已经……？

“你不信我么？”穿凿歪了嘴笑着说，“那时和现在之间，已经是半世纪了。那里是既无时候，也无时间。凡已经过去的，将要是永久，凡将要来的，已经是过去了。这你不能想，然而应该信。这里一切都是真实，凡我所指示你的一切，是真的，真的！这是旋儿所不能主张的！”

穿凿嘻笑着跳到死尸的脸上往来，还开了一个极可恶的玩笑。他坐在眉毛上，牵着那长的睫毛拉开眼睑来。那眼睛，那约翰曾见它高兴地闪耀的，是疲乏地凝固了，而且在昏黄的小光中，皱蹙地白。

“那么，再下去！”穿凿大呼，“还有别的可看哩！”

蚯蚓慢慢地从右嘴角间爬出，而这可怕的游行便接下去了。

不是回转，却是向一条新的，也这么长而且幽暗的道路。

“一个老的来了，”当又有一道黑墙阻住去路的时候，蚯蚓说，“他在这里已经很久了！”

这比起前一回来，稍不讨厌。除了一个不成形的堆，从中露着白骨之外，约翰什么也看不见。成百的虫豸们和昆虫们正在默默地忙着做工。那光惹起了惊动。

“你们从那里来？谁拿光到这里来？我们用不着这个！”

它们并且赶快向沟里洞里钻进去了。但它们认出了一个同种。

“你曾在这里过么？”虫们问，“木头还硬哩。”

首先的虫否认了。

他们再往远走，穿凿当作解释者，将他所知道的指给小约翰。来了一个不成样子的脸带着狞视的圆眼，膨胀的黑的嘴唇和面庞。

“这曾是一位优雅的先生，”他于是高兴地说，“你也许曾经见过他，这样地富，这样地阔，而且这样地高傲。他保住了他的尊大了。”

这样地进行。也有瘦损的、消蚀了的形体，在映着微光而淡蓝地发亮的白发之间，也有小孩子带着大头颅，也有中年的沉思的面目。

“看哪，这是在他们死后才变老的。”穿凿说。

他们走近了一个络腮胡子的男人，高吊着嘴唇，白色的牙齿在发亮。当前额中间，有一个圆的、乌黑的小洞。

“这人被永终用手艺草草完事了。为什么不忍耐一点呢？无论如何他大概总得到这里来的。”

而且又是道路，而且是新的道路，而且又是伸开的身体带着僵硬的丑怪的脸，和不动的、交叉着叠起来的手。

“我不往下走了，”蠼螋说，“这里我不大熟悉了。”

“我们回转罢。”蚯蚓说。

“前去，只要前去！”穿凿大叫起来。这一行又前进。

“一切，凡你所见的，存在着，”穿凿进行着说，“这一切都是真的。只有一件东西不真。那便是你自己，约翰。你没有在这里，而且你也不能在这里。”

他看见约翰因了他的话，露出恐怖的僵直的眼光，便发了一通响亮的哗笑。

“这是一条绝路，我不前进了。”蠼螋烦躁着说。

“我却偏要前进，”穿凿说，而且一到道路的尽头，他便用两手挖掘起来了。“帮我，约翰！”

约翰在困苦中，不由自主地服从了，挖去那潮湿的微细的泥土。

他们浴着汗水默默地继续着工作，直到他们撞在黑色的木头上。

蚯蚓缩回了环节的头，并且向后面消失了。蠼螋也放下它的光，走了回去。

“你们进不去的，这木头太新。”它临走时说。

“我要！”穿凿说，并且用爪甲从那木头上撕下长而白的木屑来。

一种可怕的窘迫侵袭了约翰。然而他必得，他不能别的。

黑暗的空隙终于开开了。穿凿取了光，慌忙爬进去。

“这里，这里！”他叫着，一面跑往头那边。

但当约翰到了那静静地交叉着叠在胸脯上面的手那里的时候，他必须休息了。他见有瘦的、苍白的、在耳朵旁边半明半暗的手指，正在他前面。他忽然认得了，他认识手指的切痕和皱襞，长的，现在是染成深蓝了的指甲的形状。他在示指上看出一个棕色的小点来。这是他自己的手。

“这里，这里！”穿凿的声音从头那边叫喊过来，“看一下子罢，你可认识他么？”

可怜的约翰还想重行起来，走向那向他闪烁着的光去。然而他不再能够了。那小光消灭成完全的幽暗，他也失神地跌倒了。





十二


他落在一个深的睡眠里，直到那么深，在那里没有梦。

当他又从这幽暗中起来——慢慢地——到了清晨的苍茫凉爽的光中，他拂去了斑斓的、温柔的旧梦。他醒了，有如露珠之从一朵花似的，梦从他的灵魂上滑掉了。

还在可爱的景象的错杂中，半做着梦的他的眼睛的表情，是平静而且和蔼。

但因了当着黯淡的白昼之前的苦痛，他如一个羞明者，将眼睛合上了。凡有在过去的早晨所曾见的，他都看见。这似乎已经很久，很远了。然而还是时时刻刻重到他的灵魂之前，从哀愁的早晨起，直到寒栗的夜里。他不能相信，那一切恐怖，是会在一日之中出现的。他的窘迫的开初，仿佛已经是这样远，像失却在苍茫的雾里一般。

柔和的梦，无影无踪地从他的灵魂上滑去了——穿凿摇撼他——而沉郁的时光于是开始，懒散而且无色，是许多许多别的一切的前驱。

但是凡有在前夜的可怕的游行中所见的，却停留在他那里。这单是一个骇人的梦象么？

当他踌蹰着将这去问穿凿的时候，那一个却嘲笑而诧异地看着他。

“你想什么？”他问。

然而约翰却看不出他眼里的嘲笑，还问，他看得如此清楚而且分明，如在面前的一切，是否真是这样地出现了？

“不，约翰，你却怎样地胡涂呵！这样的事情是决不能发生的。”

约翰不知道他须想什么了。

“我们就要给你工作了。那么，你便不再这样痴呆地问了。”

他们便到那要帮助约翰，来觅得他所寻觅的号码博士那里去。

在活泼的街道上，穿凿忽然沉静地站住了，并且从大众中指出一个人来给约翰看。

“你还认识他么？”他问，当约翰大惊失色，凝视着那人的时候，他便在街上发出一声响亮的哗笑来。

约翰在昨夜见过他，深深地在地下。

博士亲切地接待他们，并且将他的智慧颁给约翰。他听至数小时之久，在这一天，而且在以后的许多天。

约翰所寻觅的，博士也还未曾觅得，他却几乎了。他说，他要使约翰上达，有如他自己一般。于是他们俩就要达了目的。

约翰倾听着，学习着，勤勉而且忍耐——许多日之久——许多月之久。他仅怀着些少的希望，然而他懂得，他现在应该进行——进行到他所做得到。他觉得很奇特。他寻觅光明，越长久，而他的周围却越昏暗。凡他所学的一切的开端，是很好的——只是他钻研得越深，那一切也就越凄凉，越黯淡。他用动物和植物，以及周围的一切来开手，如果观察得一长久，那便成为号码了。一切分散为号码，纸张充满着号码。博士以为号码是出色的，他并且说，号码一到，于他是光明——但在约翰却是昏暗。

穿凿伴住他，倘或他厌倦和疲乏了，便刺戟他。享用或叹赏的每一瞬间，他便埋怨他。

约翰每当学到，以及看见花朵怎样微妙地凑合，果实怎样地结成，昆虫怎样不自觉地助了它们的天职的时候，是惊奇而且高兴。

“这却是出色。”他说，“这一切是算得多么详尽，而且造得多么精妙和合式呵！”

“是的，格外合式，”穿凿说，“可惜，那合式和精妙的大部分是没有用处的。有多少花结果，有多少种子成树呢？”

“然而那一切仿佛是照着一个宏大的规划而作的，”约翰回答，“看罢！蜜蜂们自寻它们的蜜而不知道帮助了花，而花的招致蜜蜂是用了它们的颜色。这是一个规划，两者都在这上面工作，不识不知地。”

“这见得真好，但欠缺的也还多。假使那蜜蜂觉得可能，它们便在花下咬进一个洞去，损坏了那十分复杂的安排。伶俐的工师，被一个蜜蜂当作呆子！”

在人类和动物之间的神奇的凑合，那就显得更坏了。他从约翰以为美的和艺术的一切之中，指出不完备和缺点。他指示他能够侵略人和动物的、苦恼和忧愁的全军(1)，他还偏喜欢选取那最可厌的和最可恶的。

“这工师，约翰，对于他所做的一切，确是狡狯的，然而他忘却了一点东西。人们做得不歇手，只我要弥补一切损失。但看你的周围罢！一柄雨伞，一个眼镜，还有衣服和住所，都是人类的补工。这和那大规划毫无关系。那工师却毫不盘算，人们会受寒，要读书，为了这些事，他的规划是全不中用的。他将衣服交给他的孩子们，并没有盘算他们的生长。于是一切人们，便几乎都从他们的天然衣服里长大了。他们便自己拿一切到手里去，全不再管那工师和他的规划。没有交给他们的，他们也无耻地放肆地拿来——还有分明摆着的，是使他们死，于是他们便往往借了各种的诡计，在许多时光中，来回避这死。”

“然而这是人们之罪，”约翰大声说，“他们为什么任性远离那天然的呢？”

“呵，你这胡涂的约翰！倘或一个保姆使一个单纯的孩子玩耍火，并且烧起来了，谁担负这罪呢？那不识得火的孩子，还是知道那要焚烧的保姆呢？如果人们在困苦中或不自然中走错了，谁有罪，他们自己呢，还是他们和他相比，就如无知无识的孩子们一般的，无所不知的工师呢？”

“他们却并非不知，他们曾经知道……”

“约翰，假如你告诉一个孩子，‘不要弄那火，那是会痛的！’假使那孩子仍然弄，因为他不知道什么叫作痛，你就能给你脱去罪名，并且说：‘看呀！这孩子是并非不知道的么？’你深知道，那是不来听你的话的。人们就如孩子一般耳聋和昏愦。但玻璃是脆的，粘土是软的。谁造了人类而不计算他们的昏愦，便如那等人一样，他用玻璃造兵器而不顾及它会破碎，用粘土做箭而不顾及它一定要弯曲。”

这些话像是纷飞的火滴一般，落在约翰的灵魂上。他的胸中萌生了大悲痛，将他那先前的、在夜间寂静和无眠的时候常常因此而哭的苦痛驱除了。

唉！睡觉呵！睡觉呵！——曾有一时——多日之后——睡觉在他是最好的时候了。其中没有思想，也没有悲痛，他的梦还是永永引导他重到他的先前的生活去。当他梦着的时候，他仿佛觉得很华美，但在白昼，却不再能够想象那是怎样了。他仅知道他的神往和苦痛，较胜于他现今所知道的空虚和僵死的感觉。有一回，他曾苦痛地神往于旋儿；有一回，他曾时时等候着荣儿。那是多么华美呵！

荣儿！——他还在神往么？——他学得越多，他的神往便越消失。因为这也散成片段了，而且穿凿又使他了然，什么是爱。他于是自愧，号码博士说，他还不能从中做出号码来，然而快要出现了。小约翰的周围，是这样的黑暗而又黑暗。

他微微觉得感谢，是在他和穿凿的可怕的游行里没有看见荣儿。

当他和穿凿提及时，那人不说，却只狡狯地微笑。然而约翰懂得，这是并不怜恤他。

约翰一有并不学习和工作的时间，穿凿便利用着领他到人间去。他知道带他到各处，到病院中，病人们躺在大厅里，苍白消瘦的脸带着衰弱或苦痛的表情的一长列——那地方是忧郁的沉静，仅被喘息和叫唤打断了。穿凿还指示他，其中的几个将永不能出这大厅去。倘在一定的时间，人们的奔流进向这厅，来访问他患病的亲戚的时候，穿凿便说：“看哪，大家都知道，便是他们也将进这屋子和昏暗的大厅里面来，为的是毕竟在一个黑箱子里抬出来。”

“他们怎么能这样高兴呢？”约翰想。

穿凿领他到楼上的一间小厅中，其中充满着伤情的半暗，从邻室里，有风琴的遥响不住地梦幻地传来。于是穿凿从众中指一个病人给他看，是顽钝地向前凝视着沿了墙懒懒地爬来的一线日光的。

“他在这里躺了七年了，”穿凿说，“他是一个海员，他曾见印度的椰树，日本的蓝海，巴西的森林。现在他在七个长年的那些长日子，消受着一线日光和风琴游戏。他不再能走出这里了，然而还可以经过这样的一倍之久。”

从这一日起，约翰是极可怕的梦，他忽然醒来了，在小厅中，在如梦的声响中的伤情的半暗里，至于直到他的结末，只看见将起将灭的黄昏。

穿凿也领他到大教堂，使他听在那里说什么。他引他到宴会，到盛大的典礼，到几家的闺房。

约翰学着和人们认识，而且他屡次觉得，他应该想想他先前的生活、旋儿讲给他的童话和他自己的经历，有一些人，是使他记起那想在星星中看见它亡故的伙伴的火萤的——或者那金虫，那比别个老一天，而且谈论了许多生活本分的——他听到故事，则使他记起涂鸦泼剌，那十字蜘蛛中的英雄，或者记起鳗鱼，那只是躺着吃，因为一个肥胖的年青的王，就显得特别体面的。对于自己，他却比为不懂得什么叫作生活本分，而飞向光中去的那幼小的金虫。他似乎无助地残废地在地毯上各处爬，用一条线系着身子，一条锋利的线，而穿凿则牵着、掣着它。

唉，他将永不能再觅得那园子了，沉重的脚何时到来，并且将他踏碎呢？

他说起旋儿，穿凿便嘲弄他。而且他渐渐相信起来了，旋儿是从来没有的。

“然而，穿凿，那么，匙儿也就不成立了，那就全没有什么成立了。”

“全无！全无！只有人们和号码，这都是真的，存在的，无穷之多的号码。”

“然而，穿凿，那么，你就骗了我了。使我停止，使我不再寻觅罢，使我独自一个罢！”

“死怎么对你说，你不知道了么？你须成一个人，一个完全的人。”

“我不愿意。这太可怕！”

“你必须——你曾经愿意了的。看看号码博士罢，他以为这太可怕么？你要同他一样。”

这是真实。号码博士仿佛长是平静而且幸福。他不倦地不摇地走他的路，学着而且教着，知足而且和平。

“看他罢，”穿凿说，“他看见一切，而仍然一无所见。他观察人类，似乎他自己是别的东西，和他们全不一样。他闯过疾病和困苦之间，似乎不会受伤，而且他还与死往还，如不死者。他只希望懂得他之所见，而凡有于他显然的，在他是一样地正当。只要一懂得，他便立即满足了。你也须这样。”

“我却永不能。”

“好，那我就不能帮助你了。”

这永是他们的交谈的无希望的结束。约翰是疲乏而且随便了，寻觅又寻觅，是什么和为什么，他不复知道了。他已如旋儿所说的许多人们一般。

冬天来了，他几乎不知道。

当一个天寒雾重的早晨，潮湿的污秽的雪躺在街道上，并且从树木和屋顶上点滴着的时候，他和穿凿走着他平日的路。

在一处，他遇见一列年青的姑娘，手上拿着教科书。她们用雪互掷着，笑着，而且彼此捉弄着，她们的声音在雪地上清彻地发响。听不到脚步和车轮的声响，只有马的，或者一所店门的关闭，像似一个铃铛的声音。高兴的笑声，清彻地穿过这寂静。

约翰看见，一个姑娘怎样地看他而且向他凝望着，她穿一件小皮衣，戴着黑色的帽子。他熟识她的外貌，却仍不知道她是谁。她点头，而且又点一回头。

“这是谁呢？我认识她。”

“是的，这是可能的。她叫马理，有几个人称她荣儿。”

“不，这不能是。她不像旋儿。她是一个平常的姑娘。”

“哈！哈！哈！她不能像一个并不存在的或人的。然而她是，她是的。你曾经这样地很仰慕她，我现在要将你弄到她那里去了。”

“不，我不愿意见她。我宁可见她死，像别人一样。”

约翰不再向各处观看了，却是忙忙地前奔，并且喃喃着：

“这是结局。全不成立！全无！”

十三


最初的春晨的清朗温暖的日光，弥漫了大都市。明净的光进到约翰住着的小屋子中，低的顶篷上有一条大的光条，是波动着的运河的水的映象，颤抖而且闪动。

约翰坐在日照下的窗前，向大都市眺望，现在是全然另一景象了。灰色的雾，换成灿烂的蓝色的阳光，笼罩了长街的尽头和远处的塔。石片屋顶的光线闪作银白颜色，一切房屋以清朗的线和明亮的面穿过日光中——这是浅蓝天中的一个温暖的渲染。水也仿佛有了生气了。榆树的褐色的嫩芽肥而有光，喧嚷的麻雀们在树枝间鼓翼。

当他在眺望时，约翰的心情就很奇特。日光将他置身于甜的昏迷中了。其中是忘却和难传的欢乐。他在梦里凝视着波浪的光闪，饱满的榆芽，还倾听着麻雀的啾唧。在这音响里是大欢娱。

他久没有这样地柔和了，他久没有觉得这样地幸福了。

这是他重行认识的往日的日照。这是往日叫他去到自由的太阳，到园子里，他于是在暖地上的一道旧墙荫中——许多工夫，可以享用那温暖和光辉，一面凝视着面前的负暄的草梗。

在沉静中，于他是好极了，沉静给他以明确的家乡之感——有如他所记得，多年以前在他母亲的腕中。他并不饮泣或神驰，而必须思想一切的过去。他沉静地坐着，梦着，除了太阳的照临之外，他什么也不希望了。

“你怎么这样沉思地坐着呢，约翰？”穿凿叫喊，“你知道，我是不容许做梦的。”

约翰恳求地抬起了出神的眼睛。

“再给我这样地停一会罢，”他祈求说，“太阳是这样好。”

“你在太阳里会寻出什么来呢，喂？”穿凿说，“它并非什么，不过是一枝大蜡烛，你坐在烛光下或是在日光下，完全一样的。看罢！街上的那阴影和亮处——也即等于一个安静地燃烧着而不闪动的灯火的照映。而那光，也不过是照着世界上的极渺小的一点的一个极渺小的小火焰罢了。那边！那边！在那蔚蓝旁边，在我们上面和底下，是暗，冷而且暗！那边是夜，现在以及永久！”

但他的话于约翰没有效。沉静的温暖的日光贯彻了他，并且充满了他的全灵魂了——在他是平和而且明晰。

穿凿带着他到号码博士的冰冷的住所去。日象还在他的精神上飘泛了一些时，于是逐渐黯淡了，当正午时分，在他是十足的幽暗。

但到晚间，他又在都市的街道上趱行的时候，空气闷热，且被潮湿的春气充塞了。一切的发香都强烈了十倍，而在这狭窄的街中，使他窘迫。惟在空旷处，他齅出草和树林的新芽。在都市上，他看见春，在西方天际嫩红中的平静的小云里。

黄昏在都市上展开了嫩色的柔软的银灰的面纱。街上是寂静了，只在远处有一个手拉风琴弄出悲哀的节奏——房屋向着红色的暮天，都扬起一律的黑影，还如无数的臂膊一般，在高处伸出它们的尖端和烟突来。

这在约翰，有如太阳末后照在大都市上时的和蔼的微笑——和蔼地如同宽恕了一件傻事的微笑似的。那微微的温暖，还来抚摩约翰的双颊。

于是悲哀潜入了约翰的心，有这样沉重，至使他不能再走，且必须将他的脸伸向远天中深深地呼吸了。春天在叫他，他也听到。他要回答，他要去。这一切在他是后悔，爱，宽恕。

他极其神往地向上凝视。从他模胡的眼里涌出泪来。

“去罢！约翰！你不要发呆罢，人们看着你哩。”穿凿说。

蒙胧而昏暗地向两旁展开着长的单调的房屋的排列。是温和的空气中的一个苦恼，是春声里面的一声哀呼。

人们坐在门内和阶沿上，以消受这春天。这于约翰像是一种嘲侮。污秽的门畅开着，浑浊的空间等候着那些人。在远处还响着手拉风琴的悲哀的音调。“呵，我能够飞开这里，远去，冈上，海上！”

然而他仍须伴着高的小屋子，而且他醒着躺了这一夜。

他总要想念他父亲，以及和他同行的远道的散步——如果他走在他的十步之后，那父亲就给他在沙土上写字母。他总要想念那地丁花生在灌木之间的处所，以及和父亲同去搜访的那一天。他整夜看见他的父亲的脸一如先前，他在夜间安静的灯光中顾盼他，还倾听他笔锋写字的声响。

于是他每晨祈求穿凿，还给他回乡一回，往他的家和他的父亲，再看一遍沙冈和园子。现在他觉出他先前的爱父亲，过于普烈斯多和他的小屋子了，因为他现在只为他而祈求。

“那就只告诉我，他怎样了，我出外这么久，他还在恼我么？”

穿凿耸一耸肩：“即使你知道了，于你有什么益呢？”

春天却过去了，呼唤他，越呼越响。他每夜梦见冈坡上的暗绿的苔藓，透了嫩的新叶而下的阳光。

“这是不能长久如此的，”约翰想，“我就要支持不住了。”

每当他不能入睡的时候，他往往轻轻地起来，走到窗前，向着暗夜凝视。他看见蒸腾的蒙茸的小云，怎么慢慢地溜过月轮旁边，平和地飘浮在柔和的光海里。他便想，在那远方，冈阜是怎样地微睡在闷热的深夜中！在深的小树林间，绝无新叶作响，潮湿的莓苔和鲜嫩的桦条也将发香，那该是怎样地神奇呵。他仿佛听得远处有虾蟆的抑扬的合唱，满是秘密地浮过田野来，还有唯一的鸟的歌曲，是足以伴那严肃的寂静的，它将歌曲唱得如此低声地哀怨地开头，而且陡然中断，以致那寂静显得更其寂静了。鸟在呼唤他，一切都在呼唤他。他将头靠着窗沿，并且在他的臂膊上呜咽起来了。

“我不能！——我受不住。倘我不能就去，我一定会就死了。”

第二天穿凿叫他醒来的时候，他还坐在窗前，他就在那里睡着了，头靠在臂膊上。

日子过去了，又长又热，而且无变化。然而约翰没有死，他还应该担着他的苦痛。

有一日的早晨，号码博士对他说：

“我要去看一个病人，约翰，你愿意同我去么？”

号码博士有博学的名声，而且对于病和死，有许多人来邀请他的帮助。约翰是屡次伴过他的。

穿凿在这早晨异常地高兴。他总是倒立、跳舞、翻筋斗，并且玩出各种疯狂似的说笑来。他不住地非常秘密地窃笑着，像一个准备着给人一吓的人。

但号码博士却只是平常一样严正。

这一日他们走了远的路。用铁路，也用步行。约翰是还没有一同到过外边的。

这是一个温暖的、快乐的日子。约翰从车中向外望，那广大的碧绿的牧场，带着它欲飞的草和吃食的家畜，都在他身边奔过去了。他看见白胡蝶在种满花卉的地上翩跹，空气为了日热发着抖。

但他忽而悚然了：那地方展布着长的、起伏的连冈。

“唉，约翰，”穿凿窃笑着，“那就要中你的意了，你看罢！”

半信半疑地，约翰注视着沙冈。沙冈越来越近，仿佛是两旁的长沟，正在绕着它们的轴子旋转，还有几所人家，都在它们旁边扑过去了。

于是来了树木，茂密的栗树，盛开着，带着千数大的或红或白的花房，暗蓝绿色的枞树，高大而堂皇的菩提树。

这就是真实——他须再见他的沙冈。列车停止了，三人于是在成荫的枝柯下面行走。

这是深绿的莓苔，这是日光在林地上的圆点，这是桦条和松针的幽香。

“这是真实么？这是实际么？”约翰想，“幸福要来了罢？”

他的眼睛发光了，他的心大声地跳着。他快要相信他的幸福了。这些树木，这地面，他很熟识——他曾经屡次在这树林道中往来。

只有他们在道路上，此外没有人。然而约翰要回顾，仿佛有谁跟着他们似的。他又似乎从槲树枝间望见一个黑暗的人影，每当那路的最末的转角，便看不分明了。

穿凿阴险地暧昧地注视他。号码博士大踏步走，看着目前的地面。

道路于他更熟识，更相信了，他认得每一丛草、每一块石。约翰忽然剧烈地吃了惊，因为他站在他自己的住所前面了。

屋前的栗树，展开着它那大的手一般的叶子。直到上面的最高枝梢上，在繁密的圆圆的丛叶里，煊赫着华美的白色的繁花。

他听到开门的熟识的声响，他又齅到他自己的住所的气味。于是他认出了各进路、各门户，每一点，都带着一种离乡的苦痛的感觉。凡有一切，都是他的生活的、他的寂寞而可念的儿童生活的一部分。对于这些一切物事，他曾经和它们谈天，和它们在自己的理想生活中过活，这里是他决不放进一个他人的。然而现在他却觉得从这全部老屋分离，推出了，连着它们的各房间、各进路和各屋角。他觉得这分离极难挽回，他的心绪正如他在探访一个坟庄，这样地凄凉和哀痛。

只要有普烈斯多迎面跳来，那也许就减少一点非家的况味，然而普烈斯多却一定已经跑掉，或者死掉了。

然而父亲在那里呢？

他回顾开着的门和外面的日光下的园子，他看见那人，那似乎在路上追随着他们的，现在已经走向房屋来了。他越来越近，那走近仿佛只见加增。他一近门，门口便充满了一个大的、寒冷的影子。于是约翰就认出了这人。

屋里是死静，他们沉默着走上楼梯去。有一级是一踏常要作响的——这约翰知道。现在他也听到，怎样地发了三回响——这发响像是苦痛的呻吟。但到第四回的足踏，却如隐约的呃逆了。

而且约翰在上面还听到一种喘息，低微而一律，有如缓慢的时钟的走动，是一种苦痛而可怕的声音。

他的小屋子的门畅开着。约翰赶紧投以胆怯的一瞥。那地毯上的奇异的花纹是诧异而无情地凝视他，时钟站得静静地。

他们走进那发出声音来的房里去。这是父亲的卧室。太阳高兴地照着放下的绿色的床帏。西蒙，那猫，坐在窗台上的日照里。全房充满着葡萄酒和樟脑的郁闷的气味。一种低微的抽噎，现在就从近处传来了。

约翰听到柔软的声音的细语和小心的脚步的微声。于是绿帏便被掣起了。

他看见了父亲的脸，这是他近来常在目前看见的。然而完全两样了。亲爱的严正的外貌已经杳然，但在可怕地僵视。苍白了，还带着灰色的阴影。看见眼白在半闭的眼睑下，牙齿在半开的口中。头是陷枕中间，每一呻吟便随着一抬起，于是又疲乏地落在旁边了。

约翰屹立在床面前，大张了僵直的眼睛，瞠视着熟识的脸。他想什么，他不知道——他不敢用手指去一触，他不敢去握那疲乏地放在白麻布上的、衰老的干枯的双手。

环绕他的一切都黑了，那太阳，那明朗的房子，那外面的丛绿，以及历来如此蔚蓝的天空——一切，凡有在他后面的，黑了，黑，昏昧地，而且不可透彻地。在这一夜，他也别无所见，只在前面看见苍白的头。他还应该接着只想这可怜的头，这显得如此疲乏，而一定永是从新和苦痛的声息一同抬起的。

定规的动作在一转瞬间变化了。呻吟停歇，眼睑慢慢地张开，眼睛探索似地向各处凝视，嘴唇也想表出一点什么来。

“好天，父亲！”约翰低声说，并且恐怖地发着抖，看着那探索的眼睛。那困倦的眼光于是看了他一刹时，一种疲乏的微笑，便出现在陷下的双颊上。细瘦的皱缩的手从麻布上举起，还向约翰作了一种不分明的动作，就又无力地落下了。

“唉，什么！”穿凿说，“只莫是愁叹场面！”

“给我闪开，约翰，”号码博士说，“我们应该看一看，我们得怎么办。”

博士开手检查了，约翰却离开卧床，站在窗口。他凝视那日照的草和清朗的天空，以及宽阔的栗树叶，叶上坐着肥大的蓝蝇，在日光中莹莹地发闪。那呻吟又以那样的定规发作了。

一匹黑色的白头鸟在园里的高草间跳跃——大的、红黑的胡蝶在花坛上盘旋，从高树的枝柯中，冲出了野鸽的柔媚的钩辀，来到约翰的耳朵里。

里面还是那呻吟，永是如此，永是如此。他必须听——而且这来得一律，没有变换，就如下坠的水滴，会使人发狂。他紧张着等候那每一间歇，而这永是又发作了——可怕如死的临近的脚步。

而外面是温暖的，适意的日和。一切在负暄，在享受。因了甘美的欢乐，草颤抖着，树叶簌簌着，高在树梢上，深在蠢动的蔚蓝中，飘浮着一只平静地鼓翼的苍鹭。

约翰不懂这些，这一切于他都是疑团。他的灵魂是这样地错乱和幽暗。——“怎么这一切竟同时到我这里呢？”他自己问。

“我真是他么？这是我的父亲，我本身的父亲么？——我的，我约翰的？”

在他，似乎是他在说起一个别的人。一切是他所听到的故事。他听得有一个人讲，讲约翰，讲他所住的房屋，讲他舍去而垂死的他的父亲。他自己并非那他，他是听到了谈讲。这确是一般悲惨的故事，很悲惨。但他和这是不相干的。

是的！——是的！偏是！他自己就是那他，他！约翰！

“我不懂得这事情，”号码博士站起身来的时候说，“这是一个疑难的症候。”

穿凿站在约翰的近旁。

“你不要来看一看么，约翰？这是一件有趣味的事情。博士不懂它。”

“放下我，”约翰说，也不回头，“我不能想。”

但穿凿却立在约翰的后面，对他絮语，照例尖利地传入他的耳朵来。

“不想？——你相信，你不能想么？那是你错了。你应该想。你即使看着丛绿和蓝色的天，那是于你无益的。旋儿总是不来的。而且在那边的生病的人，无论如何就要死的。这你看得很明白，同我们一样。他的苦恼是怎样呢，你可想想么？”

“我不知道那些，我不要知道那些。”

约翰沉默了，并且倾听着呻吟，这响得如低微的苛责的哀诉。号码博士在一本小书上写了一点略记。床头坐着那曾经追随他们的黑暗的形象——低着头，向病人伸开了长臂膊，深陷的眼睛看定了时钟。

尖利的絮语又在他的耳边发作了。

“你为什么这样凄凉地注视呢，约翰？你确有你的意志的。那边横着沙冈，那边有日光拂着丛绿，那边有禽鸟在歌唱和胡蝶在翩跹。你还希望什么呢，等候旋儿么？如果他在一个什么地方，那他就一定在那地方的，而他为什么不来呢？——他可是太怕那在头边的幽暗朋友么？但他是永在那里的。”

“你可看出，一切事情都是想象么，约翰？”

“你可听清那呻吟么？这比刚才已经微弱一点了，你能听出它不久就要停止。那么，怎么办呢？当你在外面冈蔷薇之间跑来跑去的时候，也曾有过这么多的呻吟了。你为什么站在这里，悲伤着，而不像你先前一般，到沙冈去呢？看哪！那边是一切烂熳着，馥郁着，而且歌唱着，像毫无变故似的。你为什么不参与一切兴趣和一切生活的呢？”

“你方才哀诉着，神往着——那么，我就带领你去，到你要去的地方，我也不再和你游览了，我让你自由，通过高草，躺在凉荫中，并且任飞蝇绕着你营营，并且吸取那嫩草的香味，我让你自由，就去罢！再寻旋儿去罢！”

“你不愿意，那你就还是独独相信我。凡我所说给你的，是真实不是？说谎的是旋儿，还是我呢？”

“听那呻吟！——这么短，这么弱。这快要平静了。”

“你不要这样恐怖地四顾罢，约翰。那平静得越早，就越好。那么，就不再有远道的游行，你也永不再和他去搜访地丁花了。因为你走开了，这二年他曾经和谁游行了呢？——是的，你现在已经不能探问他。你将永不会知道了。你就只得和我便满足。假使你略早些认识我，你现在便不这样苦恼地注视了。你从来不这样，像现在似的。从你看来，你以为号码博士像是假惺惺么？这是会使他忧闷的，正如在日照中打呼卢的那猫一样。而且这是正当的。这样的绝望有什么用呢？这是花卉们教给你的么？如果一朵被折去了，它们也不悲哀。这不是幸福么？它们无所知，所以它们是这样。你曾经开始，知道一点东西了，那么，为幸福计，你也就应该知道一切。这惟我能够教授你。一切，或简直全无。”

“听我。他是否你的父亲，于你有什么相干呢？他是一个垂死的人——这是一件平常事。”

“你还听到那呻吟么？——很微弱，不是么？——这就要到结局了。”

约翰在恐怖的窘迫中，向卧床察看。西蒙，那猫，跳下窗台，伸一伸四肢，并且打着呼卢在床上垂死者的身边躺下了。

那可怜的，疲乏的头已经不再动弹，——挤在枕头里静静地躺着——然而从半开的口中却还定规地发出停得很短的疲乏的声音。这也低下去了，难于听到了。

于是死将黑暗的眼睛从时钟转到沉埋的头上，并且抬起手来。于是寂静了。僵直的容貌上蒙上了一层青苍的阴影。寂静，渺茫的空虚的寂静！

约翰等待着，等待着。

然而那定规的声息不再回来了。止于寂静——大的，呼哨的寂静。

在最末的时刻，也停止了倾听的紧张，这在约翰，仿佛是灵魂得了释放，而且坠入了一个黑的、无底的空虚。他越坠越深。环绕他的是寂静和幽暗。

于是响来了穿凿的声音，仿佛出自远方似的。

“哦，这故事那也就到结局了。”

“好的，”号码博士说，“那么，你可以看一看这是什么了。我都交付你。我应该去了。”

还半在梦里，约翰看见晃耀着闪闪的小刀。

那猫做了一个弓腰，在身体旁边冷起来了，它又寻得了日照。

约翰看见，穿凿怎样地拿起一把小刀，仔细地审视，并且走向床边来。

于是约翰便摆脱了昏迷，当穿凿走到床边之前，他就站在他前面。

“你要怎么？”他问。因为震悚，他大张着眼睛。

“我们要看看，这是怎么一回事。”穿凿说。

“不用。”约翰说，而且他的声音响得深如一个男子的声音。

“这是干什么？”穿凿发着激烈的闪烁的眼光，问，“你能禁止我这事么？你不知道我有多么强么？”

“我不要这事。”约翰说。他咬了牙关，并且深深地呼吸。他看定穿凿，还向他伸出手去。

然而穿凿走近了。于是约翰抓住他的手腕，而且和他格斗。

穿凿强，他是知道的，他向来未曾反抗他。但是他不退缩，不气馁。

小刀在他眼前闪烁，他瞥见红焰和火花，然而他不弛懈，并且继续着格斗。

他知道他倘一失败，将有何事发生。他认识那事，他先前曾经目睹过。然而躺在他后面的是什么呢，他的父亲，而且他不愿意看见那件事。(1)

当他们喘息着格斗时中，他们后面横着已死的身体，伸开而且不动，一如躺着一般。在平静的瞬息间，眼白分明如一条线，嘴角吊起，显着僵直的露齿的笑容。独有那两人在他们的争斗中撞着卧床的时候，头便微微地往来摇动。

约翰还是支持着——呼吸不济，他什么都看不见了。当他眼前张起了一层血似的通红的面纱。但他还站得住。

于是在他掌握中的那两腕的抵抗力，慢慢地衰退了。他两手中的紧张减少，臂膊懒散地落下，而且捏着拳的手里是空虚了。

他抬眼看时，穿凿消失了。只有死还坐在床上，并且点头。

“这是你这边正当的，约翰。”他说。

“他会再来么？”约翰低声说。死摇摇头。

“永不，谁敢对他，就不再见他了。”

“旋儿呢？那么，我将再见旋儿呢？”

那幽暗的人看着约翰许多时。他的眼光已不复使人恐怖了——却是温和而加以诚恳——他吸引约翰如一个至大的深处。

“独有我能领你向旋儿去。独由我能觅得那书儿。”

“那么你带着我罢——现今，不再有人在这里了——你也带着我罢，像别人一样！我不愿意再下去了……”死又摇摇头。

“你爱人类，约翰。你自己不知道，然而你永是爱了他们。成一个好人，那是较好的事。”

“我不愿意——你带着我罢……”

“不然，不然。你愿意——你不能够别样的……”

于是那长的、黑暗的形体，在约翰眼前如雾了。它散成茫昧的形状，一道霏微的灰色的烟霭透过内房，并且升到日光里去了。

约翰将头俯在床沿上，哭那死掉的人。

十四


许多时之后，他抬起头来。日光斜照进来，且有通红的光焰。这都如直的金杖一般。

“父亲！父亲！”约翰低声说。

外面的全自然，是因了太阳，被灿烂的金黄的炽浪所充满了。每一片叶，都绝不动弹地挂着，而且一切沉默在严肃的太阳崇奉中。

而且和那光一同飘来了一种和软的声息，似乎是明朗的光线们唱着歌：

“太阳的孩子！太阳的孩子！”

约翰昂了头，倾听着。在他耳朵里瑟瑟地响：

“太阳的孩子！太阳的孩子！”

这像是旋儿的声音。只有他曾经这样地称呼过他的——他现在是在叫他么？

然而他看见了身边的相貌——他不愿意再听了。

“可怜的，爱的父亲！”他说。

然而他周围又忽地作响，从各方面围着他，这样强，这样逼，至使他因为这神奇的枨触而发抖了。

“太阳的孩子！太阳的孩子！”

约翰站起身来，且向外面看日。怎样的光！那光是怎样地华美呵！这涨满了全树梢，并且在草莽间发闪，还洒在黑暗的阴影里。这又充满了全天空，一直高到蔚蓝中，最初的柔嫩的晚云所组成的处所。

从草地上面望去，他在绿树和灌木间看见冈头。它们的顶上横着赤色的金，阴影里悬着天的蓝郁。

它们平静地展伸着，躺在嫩采的衣装里。它们的轮廓的轻微的波动，是祷告似的招致和平的。约翰又觉得仿佛先前旋儿教他祷告的时候了。

在蓝衣中的光辉的形相，不是他么？看哪！在光中央闪烁，在金蓝的雾里，向他招呼的，不是旋儿么？

约翰慌忙走出，到日光中。他在那里停了一瞬息。他觉到光的神圣的敬礼，枝柯这样地寂静，他几乎不敢动弹了。

然而他前面那里又是光辉的形相。那是旋儿，一定的！那是。金发的发光的头转向他了，嘴半开了，似乎他要呼唤。他用右手招致他，左手擎着一点东西。他用纤瘦的指尖高高地拿着它，并且在他手中辉煌和闪烁。

约翰发一声热情洋溢的幸福的欢呼，奔向那心爱的现象去。然而那形相却升上去了，带着微笑的面目和招致的手，在他前面飘浮。也屡次触着地面，慢慢地弯腰向下，但又即轻捷地升腾，向远处飘泛，仿佛因风而去的种子似的。

约翰也愿意升腾，像他先前，像在他的梦里一般，飘向那里去，然而大地掣回他的脚，他的脚步也沉重地在草地上绊住了。他穿过灌木，尽力觅他的道路，柯叶瑟瑟地拂着他的衣裳，枝条也鞭打他的脸。他喘息着爬上苔封的冈坡。然而他不倦地追随着，并且目不转睛地看着旋儿的发光的现象和在他擎起的手里闪烁的东西。

他于是到了冈中间。炎热的谷里盛开着冈蔷薇，用了它们千数浅黄的花托，在日光中眺望。也开着许多别的花，明蓝的、黄的和紫的——郁闷的热躺在小谷上，并且抱着放香的杂草。强烈的树脂的气味，布满空气中。约翰前行时，微微地觉得麝香草和柔软地在他脚下的干枯的鹿苔的香气。这是微醺的美观。

他又看见，在可爱的，他所追随的形象之前，斑斓的冈胡蝶怎样地翩跹着。小而红的和黑色的胡蝶，还有沙眸子，是带着淡蓝色的绸似的翅子的有趣的小蝶儿。生活在冈蔷薇上的金色的甲虫，绕着他的头飞鸣，又有肥胖的土蜂，在晒萎的冈草间嗡嗡着跳舞。

只要他能到旋儿那里，那是怎样地华美，怎样地幸福呵。

然而旋儿飘远了，越飘越远。他必须绝息地追随。高大的浅色叶片的棘丛迎面而来，并且抓他，用了它们的刺。他奔跑时，倘将那黯淡而蒙茸的王烛挤开了，它们便摇起伸长的头来。他爬上沙冈去，有刺的冈草将他的两手都伤损了。

他冲过桦树的矮林，那地方是草长至膝，有水禽从闪烁于丛莽之间的小池中飞起。茂密的、开着白花的山栀子，将它的香气夹杂着桦树枝和繁生在湿地上的薄荷的芳香。

但那树林，那丛绿，那各色的花朵，都过去了。只有奇异的、淡黄的海蓟，生长在黯淡的稀疏的冈草里。

在最末的冈排之巅，约翰看见了旋儿的形象。那东西在高擎的手里，耀眼地生光。那边有一种大而不停的腾涌，十分秘密地引诱着作声，被凉风传到。那是海。约翰觉得，这于他相近了，一面慢慢地上了冈头。他在那上面跪下，并且向着海凝望。

当他从冈沿上起来的时候，红焰绕着他的周围。晚云为了光的出发，已自成了群了。它们如一道雄伟的峰峦的大圈子，带着红炽的墙，围绕着落日。海上是一条活的紫火的大路，即是一条发焰的灿烂的光路，引向遥天的进口的。

太阳之后，眼睛还未能审视的处所，在光的洞府的深处，蠕动着蓝和明红参杂起来的娇嫩的色采。在外面，沿着全部的远天，晃耀着通红的烈焰和光条，以及从垂死的火的流血的毛毳中来的明亮的小点。

约翰等待着——直到那日轮触着了通日的红炽的路的最外的末端。

他于是向下看。在那路的开端上，是他所追随的光辉的形象。一种乘坐器具，清晰而晃耀如水晶，在宽广的火路上飘浮。船的一边，立着旋儿的苗条的丰姿，金的物件在他手中灿烂。在别一端，约翰看出那幽暗的死来。

“旋儿！旋儿！”约翰叫喊。但在这一时，当约翰将近那神奇的乘具的时候，他一瞥道路的远的那一端。在大火云所围绕的明亮的空阴之中，他看见一个小小的黑色的形相。这逐渐大起来了，近来了一个人，静静地在汹涌的火似的水上走。

红炽的波涛在他的脚下起伏，然而他沉静而严正地近来了。

这是一个人，他的脸是苍白的，他的眼睛深而且暗。有这样地深，就如旋儿的眼睛，然而在他的眼光里是无穷的温和的悲痛，为约翰所从来没有在别的眼里见过的。

“你是谁呢？”约翰问，“你是人么？”

“我更进！”他说。

“你是耶稣，你是上帝么？”约翰问。

“不要称道那些名字，”那人说，“先前，它们是纯洁而神圣如教士的法衣，贵重如养人的粒食，然而它们变作傻子的呆衣饰了。不要称道它们，因为它们的意义成为迷惑，它的崇奉成为嘲笑。谁希望认识我，他从自己抛掉那名字，而且听着自己。”

“我认识你，我认识你。”约翰说。

“我是那个，那使你为人们哭的，虽然你不能领会你的眼泪。我是那个，那将爱注入你的胸中的，当你没有懂得你的爱的时候。我和你同在，而你不见我。我触动你的灵魂，而你不识我。”

“为什么我现在才看见你呢？”

“必须许多眼泪来弄亮了见我的眼睛。而且不但为你自己，你却须为我哭，那么，我于你就出现，你也又认识我如一个老朋友了。”

“我认识你！——我又认识你了。我要在你那里！”

约翰向他伸出手去。那人却指向晃耀的乘具，那在火路上慢慢地漂远的。

“看哪！”他说，“这是往凡有你所神往的一切的路。别一条是没有的。没有这两条你将永远觅不到那个。就选择罢。那边是大光，在那里，凡你所渴欲认识的，将是你自己。那边，”他指着黑暗的东方，“那地方是人性和他们的悲痛，那地方是我的路。并非你所熄灭了的迷光，倒是我将和你为伴。看哪，那么你就明白了。就选择罢！”

于是约翰慢慢地将眼睛从旋儿的招着的形相上移开。并且向那严正的人伸出手去。并且和他的同伴，他逆着凛烈的夜风，上了走向那大而黑暗的都市，即人性和他们的悲痛之所在的艰难的路。

……………………………………………………………………

我大概还要给你们讲一回小约翰，然而那就不再像一篇童话了。





附录一


译者序


在我那《马上支日记》里，有这样的一段——

到中央公园，径向约定的一个僻静处所，寿山已先到，略一休息，便开手对译《小约翰》。这是一本好书，然而得来却是偶然的事。大约二十年前罢，我在日本东京的旧书店里买到几十本旧的德文文学杂志，内中有着这书的绍介和作者的评传，因为那时刚译成德文。觉得有趣，便托丸善书店去买来了；想译，没有这力。后来也常常想到，但是总被别的事情岔开。直到去年，才决计在暑假中将它译好，并且登出广告去，而不料那一暑假过得比别的时候还艰难。今年又记得起来，翻检一过，疑难之处很不少，还是没有这力。问寿山可肯同译，他答应了，于是就开手，并且约定，必须在这暑假期中译完。

这是去年，即一九二六年七月六日的事。那么，二十年前自然是一九〇六年。所谓文学杂志，绍介着《小约翰》的，是一八九九年八月一日出版的《文学的反响》（Dasliterarische Echo），现在是大概早成了旧派文学的机关了，但那一本却还是第一卷的第二十一期。原作的发表在一八八七年，作者只二十八岁；后十三年，德文译本才印出，译成还在其前，而翻作中文是在发表的四十整年之后，他已经六十八岁了。

日记上的话写得很简单，但包含的琐事却多。留学时候，除了听讲教科书，及抄写和教科书同种的讲义之外，也自有些乐趣，在我，其一是看看神田区一带的旧书坊。日本大地震后，想必很是两样了罢，那时这一带书店颇不少，每当夏晚，常常猬集着一群破衣旧帽的学生。店的左右两壁和中央的大床上都是书，里面深处大抵跪坐着一个精明的掌柜，双目炯炯，从我看去很像一个静踞网上的大蜘蛛，在等候自投罗网者的有限的学费。但我总不免也如别人一样，不觉逡巡而入，去看一通，到底是买几本，弄得很觉得怀里有些空虚。但那破旧的半月刊《文学的反响》，却也从这样的处所得到的。

我还记得那时买它的目标是很可笑的，不过想看看他们每半月所出版的书名和各国文坛的消息，总算过屠门而大嚼，比不过屠门而空咽者好一些，至于进而购读群书的野心，却连梦中也未尝有。但偶然看见其中所载《小约翰》译本的标本，即本书的第五章，却使我非常神往了。几天以后，便跑到南江堂去买，没有这书，又跑到丸善书店，也没有，只好托他向德国去定购。大约三个月之后，这书居然在我手里了，是茀垒斯（Anna Fles）女士的译笔，卷头有赉赫博士（Dr．Paul Raché）的序文，《内外国文学丛书》（Bibliothek die Gesamt-Literatur des In-und-Auslandes，Verlag von Otto Hendel，Halle a．d．S．）之一，价只七十五芬涅，即我们的四角，而且还是布面的！

这诚如序文所说，是一篇“象征写实底童话诗”。无韵的诗，成人的童话。因为作者的博识和敏感，或者竟已超过了一般成人的童话了。其中如金虫的生平、菌类的言行、火萤的理想、蚂蚁的平和论，都是实际和幻想的混合。我有些怕，倘不甚留心于生物界现象的，会因此减少若干兴趣。但我预觉也有人爱，只要不失赤子之心，而感到什么地方有着“人性和他们的悲痛之所在的大都市”的人们。

这也诚然是人性的矛盾，而祸福纠缠的悲欢。人在稚齿，追随“旋儿”，与造化为友。福乎祸乎，稍长而竟求知：怎么样，是什么，为什么？于是招来了智识欲之具象化：小鬼头“将知”；逐渐还遇到科学研究的冷酷的精灵：“穿凿”。童年的梦幻撕成粉碎了；科学的研究呢，“所学的一切的开端，是很好的——只是他钻研得越深，那一切也就越凄凉，越黯淡。”——惟有“号码博士”是幸福者，只要一切的结果，在纸张上变成数目字，他便满足，算是见了光明了。谁想更进，便得苦痛。为什么呢？原因就在他知道若干，却未曾知道一切，遂终于是“人类”之一，不能和自然合体，以天地之心为心。约翰正是寻求着这样一本一看便知一切的书，然而因此反得“将知”，反遇“穿凿”，终不过以“号码博士”为师，增加更多的苦痛。直到他在自身中看见神，将径向“人性和他们的悲痛之所在的大都市”时，才明白这书不在人间。惟从两处可以觅得：一是“旋儿”，已失的原与自然合体的混沌，一是“永终”——死，未到的复与自然合体的混沌。而且分明看见，他们俩本是同舟……

假如我们在异乡讲演，因为言语不同，有人口译，那是没有法子的，至多，不过怕他遗漏，错误，失了精神。但若译者另外加些解释、申明、摘要，甚而至于阐发，我想，大概是讲者和听者都要讨厌的罢。因此，我也不想再说关于内容的话。

我也不愿意别人劝我去吃他所爱吃的东西，然而我所爱吃的，却往往不自觉地劝人吃。看的东西也一样，《小约翰》即是其一，是自己爱看，又愿意别人也看的书，于是不知不觉，遂有了翻成中文的意思。这意思的发生，大约是很早的，因为我久已觉得仿佛对于作者和读者，负着一宗很大的债了。

然而为什么早不开手的呢？“忙”者，饰辞；大原因仍在很有不懂的处所。看去似乎已经懂，一到拔出笔来要译的时候，却又疑惑起来了，总而言之，就是外国语的实力不充足。前年我确曾决心，要利用暑假中的光阴，仗着一本辞典来走通这条路，而不料并无光阴，我的至少两三个月的生命，都死在“正人君子”和“学者”们的围攻里了。到去年夏，将离北京，先又记得了这书，便和我多年共事的朋友，曾经帮我译过《工人绥惠略夫》的齐宗颐君，躲在中央公园的一间红墙的小屋里，先译成一部草稿。

我们的翻译是每日下午，一定不缺的是身边一壶好茶叶的茶和身上一大片汗。有时进行得很快，有时争执得很凶，有时商量，有时谁也想不出适当的译法。译得头昏眼花时，便看看小窗外的日光和绿荫，心绪渐静，慢慢地听到高树上的蝉鸣，这样地约有一个月。不久我便带着草稿到厦门大学，想在那里抽空整理，然而没有工夫；也就住不下去了，那里也有“学者”。于是又带到广州的中山大学，想在那里抽空整理，然而又没有工夫；而且也就住不下去了，那里又来了“学者”。结果是带着逃进自己的寓所——刚刚租定不到一月的，很阔，然而很热的房子——白云楼。

荷兰海边的沙冈风景，单就本书所描写，已足令人神往了。我这楼外却不同：满天炎热的阳光，时而如绳的暴雨；前面的小港中是十几只蜑户的船，一船一家，一家一世界，谈笑哭骂，具有大都市中的悲欢。也仿佛觉得不知那里有青春的生命沦亡，或者正被杀戮，或者正在呻吟，或者正在“经营腐烂事业”和作这事业的材料。然而我却渐渐知道这虽然沉默的都市中，还有我的生命存在，纵已节节败退，我实未尝沦亡。只是不见“火云”，时窘阴雨，若明若昧，又像整理这译稿的时候了。于是以五月二日开手，稍加修正，并且誊清，月底才完，费时又一个月。

可惜我的老同事齐君现不知漫游何方，自去年分别以来，迄今未通消息，虽有疑难，也无从商酌或争论了。倘有误译，负责自然由我。加以虽然沉默的都市，而时有侦察的眼光，或扮演的函件，或京式的流言，来扰耳目，因此执笔又时时流于草率。务欲直译，文句也反成蹇涩；欧文清晰，我的力量实不足以达之。《小约翰》虽如波勒兑蒙德说，所用的是“近于儿童的简单的语言”，但翻译起来，却已够感困难，而仍得不如意的结果。例如末尾的紧要而有力的一句：“Und mit seinem Begleiter ging er den frostigen Nachtwindeentgegen，den schweren Weg nach der grossen，finstern Stadt，wo die Menschheit war und ihr Whe．”那下半，被我译成这样拙劣的“上了走向那大而黑暗的都市即人性和他们的悲痛之所在的艰难的路”了，冗长而且费解，但我别无更好的译法，因为倘一解散，精神和力量就很不同。然而原译是极清楚的：上了艰难的路，这路是走向大而黑暗的都市去的，而这都市是人性和他们的悲痛之所在。

动植物的名字也使我感到不少的困难。我的身边只有一本《新独和辞书》，从中查出日本名，再从一本《辞林》里去查中国字。然而查不出的还有二十余处，这些的译成，我要感谢周建人君在上海给我查考较详的辞典。但是，我们和自然一向太疏远了，即使查出了见于书上的名，也不知道实物是怎样。菊呀，松呀，我们是明白的，紫花地丁便有些模胡，莲馨花（Primel）则连译者也不知道究竟是怎样的形色，虽然已经依着字典写下来。有许多是生息在荷兰沙地上的东西，难怪我们不熟悉，但是，例如虫类中的鼠妇（Kellerassel）和马陆（Lauferkäfer），我记得在我的故乡是只要翻开一块湿地上的断砖或碎石来就会遇见的。我们称后一种为“臭婆娘”，因为它浑身发着恶臭。前一种我未曾听到有人叫过它，似乎在我乡的民间还没有给它定出名字；广州却有：“地猪”。

和文字的务欲近于直译相反，人物名却意译，因为它是象征。小鬼头Wistik去年商定的是“盖然”，现因“盖”者疑词，稍有不妥，索性擅改作“将知”了。科学研究的冷酷的精灵Pluizer即德译的Klauber，本来最好是译作“挑剔者”，挑谓挑选，剔谓吹求。但自从陈源教授造出“挑剔风潮”这一句妙语以来，我即敬避不用，因为恐怕“闲话”的教导力十分伟大，这译名也将蓦地被解为“挑拨”。以此为学者的别名，则行同刀笔，于是又有重罪了，不如简直译作“穿凿”。况且中国之所谓“日凿一窍而‘混沌’死”，也很像他的将约翰从自然中拉开。小姑娘Robinetta我久久不解其义，想译音；本月中旬托江绍原先生设法作最末的查考，几天后就有回信——

ROBINETTA一名，韦氏大字典人名录未收入。我因为疑心她与ROBIN是一阴一阳，所以又查ROBIN，看见下面的解释——

ROBIN：是ROBERT的亲热的称呼，

而ROBERT的本训是“令名赫赫”（！）

那么，好了，就译作“荣儿”。

英国的民间传说里，有叫作Robin good fellow的，是一种喜欢恶作剧的妖怪。如果荷兰也有此说，则小姑娘之所以称为Robinetta者，大概就和这相关。因为她实在和小约翰开了一个可怕的大玩笑。

《约翰跋妥尔》一名《爱之书》，是《小约翰》的续编，也是结束。我不知道别国可有译本；但据他同国的波勒兑蒙德说，则“这是一篇象征底散文诗，其中并非叙述或描写，而是号哭和欢呼”；而且便是他，也“不大懂得”。

原译本上赉赫博士的序文，虽然所说的关于本书并不多，但可以略见十九世纪八十年代的荷兰文学的大概，所以就译出了。此外我还将两篇文字作为附录。一即本书作者拂来特力克·望·蔼覃的评传，载在《文学的反响》一卷二十一期上的。评传的作者波勒兑蒙德，是那时荷兰著名的诗人，赉赫的序文上就说及他，但于他的诗颇致不满。他的文字也奇特，使我译得很有些害怕，想中止了，但因为究竟可以知道一点望·蔼覃的那时为止的经历和作品，便索性将它译完，算是一种徒劳的工作。末一篇是我的关于翻译动植物名的小记，没有多大关系的。

评传所讲以外及以后的作者的事情，我一点不知道。仅隐约还记得欧洲大战的时候，精神底劳动者们有一篇反对战争的宣言，中国也曾译载在《新青年》上，其中确有一个他的署名。

一九二七年五月三十日

鲁迅于广州东堤寓楼之西窗下记





附录二


原序


在我所译的科贝路斯的《运命》（Couperus' Noodlot）出版后不数月，能给现代荷兰文学的第二种作品以一篇导言，公之于世，这是我所欢喜的。在德国迄今对于荷兰的少年文学的漠视，似乎逐渐消灭，且以正当的尊重和深的同情的地位，给与这较之其他民族的文学，所获并不更少的荷兰文学了。

人们于荷兰的著作，只给以仅少的注重，而一面于凡有从法国、俄国、北欧来的一切，则热烈地向往。最先的原因，大概是由于久已习惯了的成见。自从十七世纪前叶，那伟大的诗人英雄约思忒·望·覃蓬兑勒（Joost van den Bondel，1587—1679）以他的圆满的表现，获得荷兰文学的花期之后，荷兰的文学底发达便入于静止状态，这在时光的流驶里，其意义即与长久的退化相同了。凡荷兰人的可骇的保守的精神、旧习的拘泥、得意的自满，因而对于进步的完全的漠视，永不愿有所动摇——这些都忠实地在文学上反映出来，也便将她做成了一个无聊的文学。他们的讲道德和教导的苦吟的横溢，不可忍受的宽泛，温暖和深入的心声的全缺，荷兰文学是久为站在Mynheer和Mevouw（译者注：荷兰语，先生和夫人）的狭隘细小的感觉范围之外的人们所不能消受的。

在几个成功的尝试之后，至八十年代的开头，荷兰文学上才发生了新鲜活泼的潮流，将她从古老的旧弊中撕出了。我在这里应该简略地记起几个人，在荷兰著作界上，他们是取得旧和新倾向之间的中间位置的，并且也可以看作现代理想的智力的提倡者，在最后的几年，他们都在荷兰读者的文学底见解上，唤起了一种很大的转变来。

这里首先应该称道的是天才的台凯尔（Eduard Douwes Dekker，1820—1887），他用了谟勒泰都黎（Multatuli）这一个名号作文，而他一八六〇年所发表的传奇小说Max Havelaar，在文学上也造成了分明的变动。这书是将崭新的材料输入于文学的，此外还因为描写的特殊体格，那荷兰散文的温暖生动的心声，便突然付与了迄今所不识的圆熟和转移，所以这也算作荷兰的文学底发达上的一块界石。谟勒泰都黎之次，在此所当列举的是两个批评家兼美学家蒲司堪海忒（C．Busken-Huet，1826—1886）和孚斯美尔（Karl Vosmaer，1826—1888）。虽然孚斯美尔晚年时，当新倾向发展起来的时候，对之颇为漠视，遂在青年中造成许多敌人，然而他确有不可纷争的劳绩，曾给新倾向开路，直到一个一定之点，于是他们能够从此前进了。新理想的更勇敢的先锋是蒲司堪海忒，他在《文学底幻想和批评》这标题之中，所集成的论著，是在凡有荷兰底精神所表出的一切中最为圆满的了。

人也可以举出波士本图珊夫人（Gertrude Bosboom-Toussaint，1812—1886）作为一个新倾向的前驱，她的最初的传奇小说和人情小说，是还站在盘旋于自满的宽泛中的范围里和应用普通材料的旧荷兰史诗上的，但后来却转向社会底和心理学底问题，以甚大的熟练，运用于几种传奇小说上，如Major Frans及Raymond de schrijnwerker。

继八十年代初的新倾向之后，首先的努力，是表面的，对于形式。人们为韵文和散文寻求新的表现法，这就给荷兰语的拙笨弄到了流动和生命。于是先行试验，将那已经全没在近两世纪由冷的回想所成的诗的尘芥之中的，直到那时很被忽略了的抒情诗，再给以荣誉。直到那时候，几乎没有一篇荷兰的抒情诗可言，现在则这些不惮于和别民族的相比较的抒情诗，已占得强有力的地位了。

在这里，那青年夭死的沛克（Jacques Perk，1860—1881）首先值得声叙，他那一八八三年出版的诗，始将一切的优秀联合起来，以极短的时期，助荷兰的抒情诗在世界文学上得了光荣的位置。

少年荷兰的抒情诗人中，安忒卫普（Antwerp）人波勒兑蒙德（Pol de Mont，geb．1859）实最著名于德国。他那在许多结集上所发表的诗，因为思想的新颖和勇敢，还因为异常的形式的圆满，遂以显见。他对于无可非议的外形的努力，过于一切，往往大不利于他的诗。加以他的偏爱最烦重最复杂的韵律，致使他的诗颇失掉些表现的简单和自然，而这些是抒情底诗类的第一等的必要。

一切的形式圆满，而有表现的自然者，从一八五九年生于亚摩斯达登（Amsterdam）的斯华司（Helene Swarth）可以觅得。她受教育于勃吕舍勒（Brüssel），较之故乡的语言，却是法兰西语差堪自信，因此她最初发表的两本诗集，Fleurs du Rêve（1879）和Les Printannières（1881），也用法兰西语的。后来她才和荷兰文学做了亲近的相识，但她于此却觉得熟悉不如德文。这特在她的精神生活上，加了深而持久的效力。她怎样地在极短时期中，闯入了幼时本曾熟习，而现在这才较为深信了的荷兰语的精神里，是她用这种语言的第一种著作Eenzame Bloemen（1883）就显示着的，在次年的续集Blauwe Bloemen里便更甚了。后来她还发表了许多小本子的诗，其中以Sneeuwvlohken（1888）和Passiebloemen（1892）为最有凡新荷兰的抒情诗所能表见的圆满。

繁盛地开着花的荷兰抒情诗的别的代表者，还可称道的是普林思（J．Winkker Prins）、科贝路斯（Louis Couperus）、跋尔卫（Albelt Verwey）、望·蔼覃（Frederik van Eeden）、戈尔台尔（Simon Gorter）、珂斯台尔（E．B．Koster）及其他，等等。

固有的现代的印记，即在最近时代通过一切文学而赋以新的理想和见解的大变动，一到荷兰文学上，其效力在抒情诗却较在起于八十年代后半的小说为少。外来的影响，是无可否认的。显著的是法兰西、荷兰和它向来就有活泼的精神的往还，这便在少年文学上收了效果。弗罗培尔（Flaubert），左拉（Zola），恭果尔们（Goncourts），一部分也有蒲尔治（Bourget）和舒士曼（Huysmans），联合了屡被翻译的俄国和北欧的诗人，在现代荷兰小说的发达上加了一个广远的影响。

现代荷兰散文作家的圆舞烈契尔（Frans Retscher），以他的两部小说集《裸体模特儿之研究》和《我们周围的人们》揭晓。这些小说，因为它们的苦闷的实况的描写，往往至于无聊。其余则不坏，除了第一本结集使人猜作以广告为务的名目。

实况的描写较为质实的是蒂谟（Alberdingk Thym），以望兑舍勒（L．van Deyssel）的假名写作，那两本小说《爱》和《小共和国》，都立了强有力的才士的证明，虽然他的小说得到一般的趣味时，他也还很站在摹仿的区域里。

在新近的荷兰的诗家世代之中，最年青而同时又最显著的，是那已经说过的科贝路斯（Louis Couperus），生于一八六三年。当他已以诗人出名之后，在一八九〇年公表了一种传奇小说Eline Vere。在那里，他给我们从荷兰首都的社会世界里，提出巧妙的典型来。落于心理学底小说的领域内较甚者，是他两种后来的公布，一八九一年的Noodlot（《运命》）和一八九二年的Extaze。在凡有现代荷兰文学迄今所能做到的一切中，Noodlot确是最独立和最艺术的优秀的创作。

已经称道的之外，还有一大列现代的叙事诗人在劳作，我要从他们中略叙其最显著者。

一个特殊的有望的才士是兑·斯丕（Vosmeer de Spie），他那往年发表的心理学底小说《伤感》（Een Passie），激起了相当的注视。蔼曼兹（Marcellus Emants）以蒲尔治的摹仿者出名，曾公布了不少的可取的小说。同时，什普干斯（Emile Scipgens）也以人情小说家显达。作为传奇小说作家，还可称道的是望·格罗宁干（van Groeningen）和亚莱德里诺（A．Aletrino），他们的小说Martha de Bruin和Zuster Bertha，可算作现代荷兰文学中的最好的作品。倘我临末还说及兑·美斯台尔（Johan de Meester），他的小说Een Huwelijk（《嫁娶》）正如他的《巴黎的影画》（Parijsche Schimmen），证明着优秀的观察才能，则我以为已将现代文学，凭其卓越的代表者们而敬叙了。

在一八八五年，新倾向也创立了一种机关，de Nieuwe Gids （《新前导》），这样立名，是因为对待旧的荷兰的月刊de Gids。这新的期刊是一种战斗和革命的机关，对于文学上的琐屑和陈腐，锋利而且毫无顾虑地布成战线，还给新理想勇敢地开出道路来。现今是新倾向在荷兰也闯通了，最高贵的期刊也为他们开了栏，而那旧的《前导》，那后来一如既往，止为荷兰的最著名的文学机关的，是成了那样的期刊，即将科贝路斯的小说，首先提出于荷兰的读者了。

可以看作群集于《新前导》周围的青年著作家的精神的领袖的，是拂来特力克·望·蔼覃（Frederik van Eeden），象征写实底童话诗《小约翰》的作者，那新的期刊即和它一同出世，并且由德文的翻译，使读者得以接近了。我在下面，将应用了译者给我的样样的说明，为这全体世界文学中不见其比的、如此完全奇特的、纯诗的故事的作者交出一二切近的报告。

一八六〇年生于哈来谟（Haarlem），望·蔼覃从事于医学的研究，以一八八六年毕业。他为富裕的父母的儿子，他遂可以和他的本业，在课余时一同研习他向来爱好的文学。

当大学生时，他已以几篇趣剧的作者出名，其中的两篇，曾开演于亚摩斯达登和洛泰登（Rotterdam）的剧场，得了大的功效。《小约翰》的发表，在一八八五年，只一下，便将他置身于荷兰诗人的最前列了。他的知识的广博，在他的各种小篇文字中，明白地表示着。那他所共同建立的机关，也逐年一律揭出论著来，论荷兰的、法兰西的或英吉利的文学，论社会问题，论科学的对象，无不异常分明，因了他所表出的分明的论证。他也以抒情诗人显，在荷兰迄今所到达的抒情诗里，他的诗也可以算是最好的。一八九〇年他发表了一篇较大的诗，《爱伦，苦痛之歌》（德译Ellen，ein Lied des Schmerzes），远胜于他先前的著作，并且在近数十年的一切同类作品中占了光荣的地位。一八八六年受了学位之后，蔼覃便到南希（Nancy），在有名的力波尔（Liébaul）的学校里研究催眠医术（Hypnotische Heilmethode）。此后不久，他在亚摩斯达登设立了一所现在很是繁忙的心理治疗法（Psychotherapie）的施医院。在接近亚摩斯达登的一处小地方蒲松（Bussum），他造起一所幽静的艺术家住所来，他在他的眷属中间，可以休息他的努力的职务，并且不搅乱地生活于他的艺术。在那里，在乡村的寂寞的沉静中，新近他完成了一种较大的作品，《约翰跋妥尔，爱之书》（德译Johannes Viator，das Buch von dor Liebe）。在这密接下文的诗的作品中，那成熟的艺术家，将凡有《小约翰》的作者使人期待的事都圆满了。

愿这译本也在德国增加新朋友，并且帮助了我们对于荷兰文学的渐渐苏醒的兴趣，至于稳固和进步。

附录三


拂来特力克·望·蔼覃


〔荷兰〕波勒·兑·蒙德　著

在新倾向的诗人们——我永远不懂为什么，大概十年以前，人还称为颓废派的——之中，戈尔台尔、跋尔卫、克罗斯（Kloos）、斯华司、望兑舍勒、科贝路斯、望罗夷（van Looy）、蔼仑斯（Ehrens）——那拂来特力克·望·蔼覃，那诗医，确是最出名的，最被读的，最被爱的，而且还是许多许多的读者。望兑合勒因为实况的描写有时有些粗率，往往将平均读者推开，克罗斯因了诗体和音调上的一点艰涩，斯华司是因了过甚的细致和在她的感觉的表现上有些单调。而他触动，他引诱，借着他的可爱的简明，借着理想的清晰，借着儿童般的神思，还联结着思想的许多卓拔的深。

当他在八十年代之初，发表了他的最初的大的散文诗，《小约翰》（De kleine Johannes），这迄今——在荷兰的一件大稀罕事——已经到了第四版的，这书惹起了偌大的注目，一个真的激动在北方和南方，而且竟在麻木的荷兰人那里。

许许多，是的，大部分，是愤怒了，对于那真的使人战栗的坟墓场面，当那穿凿，那科学底研究的无情的精神，“不住地否认的精神”，将可怜的幼小的约翰，领到坟墓之间，死尸之间，蛆虫之间，那在经营腐烂事业的……

许多人以为这是“过度”（overspannen，荷兰人所最喜欢的一个字），然而几乎一切都进了那在故事的开端的、魅人的牧歌的可爱的幻惑里。寂寞的梦幻的孩子在冈阜间的生活，在华美的花朵和许多动物之中，这些是作者自己也还是孩子一般永远信任的。兔、虾蟆、火萤和蜻蜓，这都使荷兰的冈阜风景成为童话的国土，一个童话的国土，就如我们的诗人爱之过于一切似的。

这故事的开演，至少是大部分，乃在幻惑之乡。那地方是花卉和草，禽鸟和昆虫，都作为有思想的东西，互相谈话，而且和各种神奇的生物往还。这些生物是全不属于精神世界，也全不属于可死者的，并且主宰着一种现时虽是极优胜、极伟大者也难于企及的力量和学问。

但在“童话”这字的本义上，《小约翰》也如谟勒泰都黎的《小威绥》（Woutertje）的故事似的，一样地这样少。却更胜于前一作品，仅有所闻和所见，在外界所能觉察的诗。这全体的表现虽是近于儿童的简单的语言，而有这样强制的威力，使人觉得并非梦境，却在一个亲历的真实里。

《小约翰》也如哲学底童话一般，有许多隐藏的自传。这小小的寓言里面的人物：旋儿、将知、荣儿、穿凿，我们对于自然的诗，有着不自识的感觉，这些便是从这感觉中拔萃出来的被发见的人格化，而又是不可抵抗的知识欲，最初的可爱的梦，或是那真实的辛辣的反话，且以它们的使人丧气的回答，来对一切我们的问题：怎么样，是什么，为什么？

《爱伦，苦痛之歌》，作为抒情诗的全体，是一个伤感的心的真实的呼号，而且那纯净伟大的人性的高贵而正直的显现，我们在这书的每一页中都能看出。蔼覃的这工作，是具有大的简素和自然的性质的，凡在一首强烈的伤感和纯净的感觉的歌中，尤须特别地从高估计。没有无端的虚掷，没有徒然的繁碎，而且在每一吟，在每一短歌或歌中，仍然足有很多的景象，为给思想和语气以圆备的表现起见，在极严的自己批评之际是极有用的。

将这歌的纯粹栖息在语气上的内容，加以分析，是我极须自警的。倘将这一类的诗，一如诗人在这“语气”里所分给我们的那样，照字面复述，怎样地自从爱伦出现之后，生活才在十分灿烂里为他展开，怎样地他为了她那出自心魂的对于他的善举的感化，在那歌中向她致谢，我以为是一种亵渎。所有现存的仇敌，沉默着和耗费着的，“不要声音也不要眼光的”，却只是可怜的肉体自己，将他的星见从他的臂膊上掣去的太早，遂使这歌的大部分，除是一个止于孤寂的诗人的灵魂的无可慰安的哀诉，他的寂寞的歌的哀诉，大苦痛的卓拔的表白之外，不能会有别样了。

从他的《苦痛之歌》的外面的形式看来，望·蔼覃可以被称为一个极其音乐底诗人。“爱伦”的拈来和表出，即全如一种音乐底工作，但这工作，为那善于出惊的通常的读者，则又作别论。

然而这音乐底，几乎只限于字声的谐美，一种谐美，此外只能在我们的独创而天才的戈尔台尔那里可以觅得它。一切的子夜小歌，虽然我在第二首里指出了很失律的一行——最末的夹出（Intermezzo）中的诗，尤其是可惜不能全懂的：“All mooie dingen verminderen”和“尾声”（Nachspiel），在这观点上都负着赏誉。

这歌的最圆满的部分，照我的意见是第二和第三吟。单用这短歌（Sonett），已足举一个诗人如望·蔼覃者为大的、真的、高的艺术家了。诗句是稀罕的，几乎是女性的娇柔，时时触动读者。在有几篇，例如这子夜小歌的第三首，是诗人用了仅足与一篇古代极简的民歌相比的简单来表出，在言语、形式、景象上，完全未加修饰的。例之一：“现在我愿意去死”，人将读而又读，永不会厌倦。

《约翰跋妥尔》，蔼覃的第三种显著的工作，据我的意见是被荷兰的读者完全误会了，连那原有文学的修养者。由我看来，这是一本书，只有我们时代的最美者足与相比的，却绝不是因了它的高尚的艺术的形式，也不是因了在里面说及的哲学的纯粹。这是一篇象征底散文诗，其中并非叙述或描写，而是号哭和欢呼，如现在已经长成了的约翰，当他在一个满是人类的悲痛的大都市中，择定了他的住所之后，在那里经历着哀愁的道路，由哀愁与爱，得了他自己的性格的清净，这两者是使他成为明洁的，遐想的纯觉的人的。我不大懂得这书，这个，我乐于承诺，并非这样地容易懂得，有如通行的抗宣斯（Conscience）的一个故事，或者颇受欢迎的望伦芮普（van Lennep），或如珂支菲勒特（Koetsveld）或培克斯坦因（Bechstein）的一篇童话。这是一本书，人可以如侃丕斯（Thomasà Kernpis）的一般，读十遍，是的，读一百遍，为的是永远从中发见新的和美的。

《弟兄》是用戏曲底形式所成就的，而诗人却还称它为悲剧……并非照着古式的悲剧，倒不如说是一篇叙事诗，那外面的服饰使人忆及悲剧，但仍然并不尽合，虽然从中也发生合唱。这是一篇戏曲底叙事诗，一如玛达赫的《人的悲剧》（Madachs，Tragädie des Menschen）浩司呵茀的《流人》（Hausohofers，Vorbannte），翟提的《孚司德》（Goethes，Faust）。我不愿深入这书的哲学底观察，虽然望·蔼覃有着这样的一个目的，也是真的。在我，那《弟兄》用了艺术家的眼睛便够观察，而且我乐于承认，这工作，即使也有些人对于全体的结构或几部分有所责备，然而远过于中庸了。要从它来期待大的戏曲底效果，是不行的，但它的最好的地方，如彼得和伊凡在墨斯科侯家的弟兄血战，却给了我们一个大的、成形的景象。

这《弟兄》的大反对，除了《理亚波》（Lioba）便难于着想了。这戏曲，较好不如说是这戏曲底童话，所施给我们的印象，大部分其实是风俗图。然而较之那样的戏曲，即倘有艺术家们，如那时在波亚（Lugné Poé）之下，最新的法国和德国的戏场改革者所曾经实演的许多新试验一般，起而开演，便将收获不少的欢迎，如那别有较胜于它之处的默退林克的《沛莱亚和美理桑》（Maeterlincks，Pelléas Mé lisande）者，也已相去得如此之远。

按材料和根本思想，《理亚波》彻头彻尾是德国底。在拈得上，尤其是在结末上，多多少少，和《孚司德》的第二部分相同。

Jam vitae flamina，

rumpe o anima！

Ignis ascendere

gestit，et tendere

ad coeli atria；

Haec mea patria．

虽然也还远一点，这不使人忆及《孚司德》的奇美的结末合唱：“一切过去的不过是一样”么？因为叙述恋爱，这一样的根本思想也贯彻全篇中。

这篇的开首，是那女的主要人物，将作苦行的童贞的理亚波，当她将入庵院的前一天，立在她的花卉之间，她在高兴她还无须穿童贞的法服。她沉思地站着时，有游猎的事接近了。她观看苍鹭和鹰在空中的斗争，而当她打算救那可怜的受伤的鸟的时候，近来了荷兰的诺尔王，赫拉尔特（Harald）。王一见她柔和地怀抱和爱护那禽鸟时，他对她说：

阿，你温和的柔顺的小姑娘，

你要这么柔和地怀抱这野的鸟儿，

你不肯喜欢是一个母亲么，

并且静稳地抚育一个小儿？

他用这话触动了理亚波心情中的强有力之处，即母爱的冲动。她随着年老的白发的王，忘却了禁欲的誓愿，而且成为他的妻了。然而她没有生产一个孩子，永不生产，虽然人们责备她，以为她有和一个勇士私通的有罪的恋爱——和她在寂寞中爱过的丹珂勒夫（Tancolf），纵或全然无罪，因为她的嘴唇只有一次当月夜里在沙冈上触着他的马的胸脯——却生了一个孩子。她丈夫死后，被一切所摈弃了，负着重罪，她和他一同烧死在烈焰的船里。

既不论那直到现在还未完成的《影像和实质之歌》（德译Liede von Schein und Wesen），更不论那哲学底、社会底、医学底和文学底论著的种种的结集，这固然含有许多值得注意的，而且也如凡有望·蔼覃所写的一切一样，在现今的荷兰文学上，显然是最高和最贵的东西，然而我为纸幅所限，我临末只还要揭出《零星的韵言》（Enkele Verzen）来，这是几月以前所发表的他的最近的工作，克罗斯也在《新前导》上说过：“诗人只是那个，那诗，无论为谁，都不仅是空洞的文字游戏，却是他的灵魂的成了音乐的感觉……”

倘在这一种光中观察它，则拂来特力克·望·蔼覃的这《零星的韵言》，在我们现今的文学所能提示的书籍里，是属于最美的。宛如看不见地呼吸着，喷出它的幽静的生活来的，幽静而洁白的花朵者，是这韵文。它将永远生存。

望·蔼覃，先前以医生住在亚摩斯达登，自停止了手术以来，就也如许多别的北荷兰的著作家一样，住在蒲松。他不仅是最大的我们的现存的诗人之一，也是最良善，最高超的人。到他那里去，人说，正如往老王大辟（David），是“负着负担的人，以及有着信仰的人”。的确，虽然他从来不索报酬，而他医治他的病者，抚养衰老者、无告者，人说，他的医治，大抵是用那上帝给他多于别个诗人的、神奇的力——磁力的崇高的电流，那秘密，他已经试验而且参透了。因为充当医生，他也是属于第一等……

动植物译名小记


关于动植物的译名，我已经随文解释过几个了，意有未尽，再写一点。

我现在颇记得我那剩在北京的几本陈旧的关于动植物的书籍。当此“讨赤”之秋，不知道它们无恙否？该还不至于犯禁罢？然而虽在“革命策源地”的广州，我也还不敢妄想从容。为从速完结一件心愿起见，就取些巧，写信去问在上海的周建人君去。我们的函件往返是七回，还好，信封上背着各种什么什么检查讫的印记，平安地递到了，不过慢一点。但这函商的结果也并不好。因为他可查的德文书也只有Hertwig的动物学和Strassburger的植物学，自此查得学名，然后再查中国名。他又引用了几回中国唯一的《植物学大辞典》。

但那大辞典上的名目，虽然都是中国字，有许多其实乃是日本名。日本的书上确也常用中国的旧名，而大多数还是他们的话，无非写成了汉字。倘若照样搬来，结果即等于没有。我以为是不大妥当的。

只是中国的旧名也太难。有许多字我就不认识，连字音也读不清；要知道它的形状，去查书，又往往不得要领。经学家对于《毛诗》上的鸟兽草木虫鱼，小学家对于《尔雅》上的释草释木之类，医学家对于《本草》上的许多动植，一向就终于注释不明白，虽然大家也七手八脚写下了许多书。我想，将来如果有专心的生物学家，单是对于名目，除采取可用的旧名之外，还须博访各处的俗名，择其较通行而合用者，定为正名，不足，又益以新制，则别的且不说，单是译书就便当得远了。

以下，我将要说的照着本书的章次，来零碎说几样。




第一章开头不久的一种植物Kerbel就无法可想。这是属于形科的，学名Anthriscus。但查不出中国的译名，我又不解其义，只好译音：凯白勒。幸而它只出来了一回，就不见了。日本叫做ジセク。




第二章也有几种：——

Buche是欧洲极普通的树木，叶卵圆形而薄，下面有毛，树皮褐色，木材可作种种之用，果实可食。日本叫作抚（Buna），他们又考定中国称为山毛榉。《本草别录》云：“榉树，山中处处有之，皮似檀槐，叶如栎槲。”很近似。而《植物学大辞典》又称掬。掬者，柏也，今不据用。

约翰看见一个蓝色的水蜻蜓（Libelle）时，想道：“这是一个蛾儿罢。”蛾儿原文是Feuerschmetterling，意云火胡蝶。中国名无可查考，但恐非胡蝶。我初疑是红蜻蜓，而上文明明云蓝色，则又不然。现在姑且译作蛾儿，以待识者指教。

旋花（Winde）一名鼓子花，中国也到处都有的。自生原野上，叶作戟形或箭镞形，花如牵牛花，色淡红或白，午前开，午后萎，所以日本谓之昼颜。

旋儿手里总爱拿一朵花。他先前拿过燕子花（Iris）；在第三章上，却换了Maiglöckchen（五月钟儿）了，也就是Maiblume（五月花）。中国近来有两个译名：君影草，铃兰。都是日本名。现用后一名，因为比较地可解。




第四章里有三种禽鸟，都是属于燕雀类的：

一、Pirol。日本人说中国叫“剖苇”，他们叫“苇切”。形似莺，腹白，尾长，夏天居苇丛中，善鸣噪。我现在译作鹪鹩，不知对否。

二、Meise。身子很小，嘴小而尖，善鸣。头和翅子是黑的，两颊却白，所以中国称为白颊鸟。我幼小居故乡时，听得农人叫它“张飞鸟”。

三、Amsel。背苍灰色，胸腹灰青，有黑斑，性机敏，善于飞翔。日本的《辞林》以为即中国的白头鸟。




第五章上还有两个燕雀类的鸟名：Rohrdrossel und Drossel。无从考查，只得姑且直译为苇雀和嗌雀。但小说用字，没有科学上那么缜密，也许两者还是同一的东西。

热心于交谈的两种毒菌，黑而胖的鬼菌（Teufelssehwamm）和细长而红，且有斑点的捕蝇菌（Fliegenschwamm），都是直译，只是“捕”字是添上去的。捕蝇菌引以自比的鸟莓（Vogelbeere），也是直译，但我们因为莓字，还可以推见这果实是红质白点，好像桑葚一般的东西。《植物学大辞典》称为七度灶，是日本名Nanakamado的直译，而添了一个“度”字。

将种子从孔中喷出，自以为大幸福的小菌，我记得中国叫作酸浆菌，因为它的形状，颇像酸浆草的果实。但忘了来源，不敢用了。索性直译德语的Erdstern，谓之地星。《植物学大辞典》称为土星菌，我想，大约是译英语的Earthstar的，但这Earth我以为也不如译作“地”，免得和天空中的土星相混。




第六章的霍布草（Hopfen）是译音的，根据了《化学卫生论》。

红膆鸟（Rotkehlchen）是译意的。这鸟也属于燕雀类，嘴阔而尖，腹白，头和背赤褐色，鸣声可爱。中国叫作知更雀。




第七章的翠菊是Aster。莘尼亚是Zinnia的音译，日本称为百日草。




第八章开首的春天的先驱是松雪草（Schneeglöckchen），德国叫它雪钟儿。接着开花的是紫花地丁（Veilchen），其实并不一定是紫色的，也有人译作堇草。最后才开莲馨花（Primel od．Schlüsselblume），日本叫樱草，《辞林》云：“属樱草科，自生山野间。叶作卵状心形。花茎长，顶生伞状的花序。花红紫色，或白色。状似樱花，故有此名。”

这回在窗外常春藤上吵闹的白头翁鸟，是Star的翻译，不是第四章所说的白头鸟了。但也属于燕雀类，形似鸠而小，全体灰黑色，顶白。栖息野外，造巢树上，成群飞鸣，一名白头发。

约翰讲的池中的动物，也是我们所要详细知道的。但水甲虫是Wasserkäfer的直译，不知其详。水蜘蛛（Wasserläufer）其实也并非蜘蛛，不过形状相像，长只五六分，全身淡黑色而有光泽，往往群集水面。《辞林》云：“中国名水黾。”因为过于古雅，所以不用。鲵鱼（Salamander）是两栖类的动物，状似蜥蜴，灰黑色，居池水或溪水中，中国有些地方简直以供食用。刺鱼原译作Stichling，我想这是不对的，因为它是生在深海的底里的鱼。Stachelfisch才是淡水中的小鱼，背部及腹部有硬刺，长约一尺，在水底的水草的茎叶或须根间作窠，产卵于内。日本称前一种为硬鳍鱼，俗名丝鱼，后一种为棘鳍鱼。

Massliebchen不知中国何名，姑且用日本名，曰雏菊。




小约翰自从失掉了旋儿，其次荣儿之后，和花卉虫鸟们也疏远了。但在第九章上还记着他遇见两种高傲的黄色的夏花：Nachtkerze und Königskerze，直译起来，是夜烛和王烛，学名Oenother biennis et Verbascum thapsus。两种都是欧洲的植物，中国没有名目的。前一种近来输入得颇多，许多译籍上都沿用日本名：月见草。月见者，玩月也，因为它是傍晚开的。但北京的花儿匠却曾另立了一个名字，就是月下香，我曾经采用在《桃色的云》里，现在还仍旧。后一种不知道底细，只得直译德国名。




第十一章是凄惨的游览坟墓的场面，当然不会再看见有趣的生物了。穿凿念动黑暗的咒文，招来的虫们，约翰所认识的有五种。蚯蚓和蜈蚣，我想，我们也谁都认识它，和约翰有同等程度的。鼠妇和马陆较为生疏，但我已在引言里说过了。独有给他们打灯笼的Ohrwurm，我的《新独和辞书》上注道：蠼螋。虽然明明译成了方块字，而且确是中国名，其实还是和Ohrwurm一样地不能懂，因为我终于不知道这究竟是怎样的东西。放出“学者”的本领来查古书，有的，《玉篇》云：“蛷螋，虫名，亦名蠼螋。”还有《博雅》云：“蛷螋，蛷也。”也不得要领。我也只好私淑号码博士，看见中国式的号码便算满足了。还有一个最末的手段，是译一段日本的《辞林》来说明它的形状：“属于直翅类中蠼螋科的昆虫。体长一寸许，全身黑褐色而有黄色的脚。无翅，有触角二十节。尾端有歧，以挟小虫之类。”




第十四章以Sandäuglein为沙眸子，是直译的，本文就说明着是一种小胡蝶。

还有一个münze，我的《新独和辞书》上除了货币之外，没有别的解释。乔峰来信云：“查德文分类学上均无此名。后在一种德文字典上查得münze可作minze解一语，而minze则薄荷也。我想，大概不错的。”这样，就译为薄荷。

一九二七年六月十四日写讫





I


I will tell you something about little Johannes．My tale has much in it of a fairy story；but it nevertheless all really happened．As soon as you do not believe it you need read no farther，as it was not written for you．Also you must never mention the matter to little Johannes if you should chance to meet him，for that would vex him， and I should get into trouble for having told you all about it．

Johannes lived in an old house with a large garden．It was difficult to find one's way about there，for in the house there were many dark doorways and staircases，and cupboards，and lumber-lofts，and all about the garden there were sheds and hen-houses．It was a whole world to Johannes．He could make long journeys there，and he gave names to all he discovered．He had named the rooms in the house from the animal world；the caterpillar-loft， because he kept caterpillars there；the hen-room，because he had once found a hen there．It had not come in of itself；but Johannes's mother had set it there to hatch eggs．In the garden he chose names from plants，preferring those of such products as he thought most interesting．Thus he had Raspberry Hill，Cherry-tree Wood，and Strawberry Hollow．Quite at the end of the garden was a place he had called Paradise，and that，of course，was lovely．There was a large pool，a lake where white water-lilies floated and the reeds held long whispered conversations with the wind．On the farther side of it there were the dunes or sand-hills．Paradise itself was a little grassy meadow on the bank，shut in by bushes，among which the hemlock grew tall．Here Johannes would sometimes lie in the thick grass，looking between the swaying reeds at the tops of the sand-hills across the water．On warm summer evenings he was always to be found there，and would lie for hours，gazing up，without ever wearying of it．He would think of the depths of the still，clear water in front of him—how pleasant it must be there among the water-plants，in that strange twilight；and then again of the distant， gorgeously coloured clouds which swept across the sand-downs—what could be behind them？ How splendid it would be to be able to fly over to them！Just as the sun disappeared，the clouds gathered round an opening so that it looked like the entrance to a grotto，and in the depths of the cavern gleamed a soft，red glow．That was what Johannes longed to reach．“If I could but fly there！”thought he to himself．“What can there be beyond？ If I could only once，just for once，get there！”

But even while he was wishing it the cavern fell asunder in rolling dark clouds before he could get any nearer．And then it grew cold and damp by the pool，and he had to go back to his dark little bedroom in the old house．

He did not live all alone there；he had his father，who took good care of him，his dog Presto and the cat Simon．Of course he loved his father best：but he did not love Presto and Simon so very much less，as a grown-up man would have done．He told Presto many more secrets than he ever told his father，and he held Simon in the greatest respect．And no wonder！Simon was a very big cat with a shining black coat and a bushy tail．It was easy to see that he was perfectly convinced of his own importance and wisdom．He was always solemn and dignified，even when he condescended to play with a rolling cork or to gnaw a stale herring's head behind a tree．As he watched Presto's flighty behaviour he would contemptuously blink his green eyes and think：“Well，well，dogs know no better！”

Now you may understand what respect Johannes had for him．But he was on much more familiar terms with little brown Presto．He was not handsome nor dignified，but a particularly good-natured and clever little dog，who never went two yards from Johannes's side，and sat patiently listening to all his master told him．I need not tell you how dearly Johannes loved Presto．But he had room in his heart for other things as well．Do you think it strange that his dark bedroom with the tiny window-panes filled a large place there？ He loved the curtains with the large-flowered pattern in which he could see faces，and which he had studied so long when he lay awake in the mornings or when he was sick；he loved the one picture which hung there，in which stiff figures were represented in a yet stiffer garden，walking by the side of a tranquil pond where fountains were spouting as high as the clouds，and white swans were swimming．But most of all he loved the hanging clock．He pulled up the weights every day with solemn care，and regarded it as an indispensable civility to look up at it whenever it struck．This of course could only be done as long as Johannes remained awake．If by some neglect the clock ran down Johannes felt quite guilty，and begged its pardon a dozen times over．You would have laughed，no doubt，if you had heard him talking to his room．But perhaps you sometimes talk to yourself；that does not seem to you altogether ridiculous；and Johannes was perfectly convinced that his hearers had quite understood him，and he required no answer．Still he secretly thought that he might perhaps have a reply from the clock or the curtains．

Johannes had schoolmates，but they were not exactly friends．He played with them，and plotted tricks with them in school，and robber-games out of school；still he never felt quite at home but when he was alone with Presto．Then he never wanted any boys，and was perfectly at his ease and safe．

His father was a wise，grave man，who sometimes took Johannes with him for long walks through the woods and over the sand-hills；but then he spoke little，and Johannes ran a few steps behind，talking to the flowers he saw，and the old trees which had always to stay in the same place，stroking them gently with his little hand on the rough bark．And the friendly giants rustled their thanks．

Sometimes his father traced letters in the sand as they went along，one by one，and Johannes spelt the words they made：and sometimes his father would stop and tell Johannes the name of some plant or animal．

And now and then Johannes would ask about what he saw， and heard many strange things．Indeed，he often asked very silly questions：Why the world was just as it was，and why the plants and animals must die，and whether miracles could ever happen．But Johannes' father was a wise man，and did not tell him all he knew；and this was better for Johannes．

At night before he went to sleep Johannes always said a long prayer．His nurse had taught him this．He prayed for his father and for Presto．Simon did not need it，he thought．He had a long prayer for himself too，and almost always ended with the wish that just for once a miracle might happen．And when he had said Amen he would look curiously round the half-dark room at the figures in the picture， which looked stranger than ever in the dim twilight，at the door-handle and the clock，wondering how the miracle would begin．But the clock always ticked in its own old fashion，and the door-knob did not stir，and it grew darker and darker，and Johannes fell asleep without any miracle having happened．But it would happen some day；of that he was sure．





II


It was a warm evening，and the pool lay perfectly still．The sun， red and tired with its day's work，seemed to pause for a moment on the edge of the world，before going down．Its glowing face was reflected，almost perfect，in the glassy water．The leaves of the beech-tree which overhung the lake took advantage of the stillness to gaze at themselves meditatively in the mirror．The solitary heron， standing on one leg among the broad leaves of the water-lilies， forgot that he had come out to catch frogs，and looked down his long nose，lost in thought．

Then Johannes came to the meadow to look into the cloud-cavern．Splash，dash！the frogs went plump off the bank．The mirror was rippled，the reflection of the sun was broken up into broad bands，and the beech-leaves rustled indignantly，for they were not yet tired of looking at themselves．

A little old boat lay tied up to the bare roots of the beech-tree．Johannes was strictly forbidden ever to get into it．Oh！how strong was the temptation this evening！The clouds were parting into a grand gateway，through which the sun would sink to rest．Shining ranks of small clouds gathered on each side like life-guards in golden armour．The pool glowed back at them，and red rays flashed like arrows between the water-reeds．

Johannes very slowly untied the rope that moored the boat to the beech-root．Oh，to float out there in the midst of that glory！ Presto had already jumped into the boat；and before his master knew what he was doing，the reeds had pushed it out，and they were drifting away together towards the setting sun．

Johannes lay in the bows staring into the heart of the cavern of light．“Wings！”thought he．“Oh，for wings now，and I should be there！”The sun was gone．The clouds were of fire．The sky in the east was deep blue．A row of willows grew on the bank．Their tiny silvery leaves stood motionless in the still air，looking like pale green lace against the dark background．

Hark！What was that？ A breath flew over the surface of the pool—like a faint gust of wind making a little groove in the water．It came from the sand-hills，from the cloud-cavern．

When Johannes looked round he saw a large blue dragon-fly sitting on the edge of the boat．He had never seen one so large．It settled there，but its wings quivered in a large circle；it seemed to Johannes that the tips of them made a ring of light．

“It must be a glow-worm dragon-fly，”thought he，“and they are very seldom seen．”

But the circle grew wider and wider，and the wings fluttered so fast that Johannes saw them only as a mist．And by degrees he saw out of the mist two dark eyes gleaming，and a slender，shining figure in a pale blue dress sat in the place where the dragon-fly had been．Its fair hair was crowned with a garland of white convolvulus， and on its shoulders were gauzy insect-wings glittering like a soap-bubble，with a thousand colours．A shiver of delight tingled through Johannes．Here was a miracle！

“Will you be my friend？”he whispered．

It was an odd way of addressing a stranger，but this was not a common case．And he had a feeling as though he had always known this strange sky-blue creature．

“Yes，Johannes！”he heard，and the voice sounded like the rustling of the sedges in the evening breeze，or the whisper of rain on the leaves in the wood．

“What is your name？”asked Johannes．

“I was born in the bell of a bindweed flower．Call me Winde-kind．”

And Windekind laughed and looked so kindly into Johannes' eyes that he felt strangely happy．

“To-day is my birthday，”Windekind went on，“I was born close to this spot．The last rays of the sun and the first beams of the moon are my father and mother．People in Holland call the sun she，but that is not right．The sun is my father．”

Johannes made up his mind to call the sun he in school tomorrow．

“And look！There comes my mother's round shining face．Good-day，mother！Oh，oh！But she looks very sad！”

He pointed to the eastern horizon．The moon was rising，broad and bright in the grey heavens，behind the lace-work of willow-twigs which stood out black against the silver disc．It really had a melancholy face．

“Come，come，mother．There is nothing wrong．I can trust him．”

The fair being fluttered his gauzy wings gleefully，and tapped Johannes on the cheek with an iris flower he had in his hand．

“She does not like my having come to talk to you．You are the first，you see；but I trust you，Johannes．You must never，never mention my name to any human being，nor speak of me at all．Will you promise me this？”

“Yes，Windekind，”said Johannes．It was still very strange to him．He felt happy beyond words，but feared lest his happiness should vanish．Was he dreaming？ By his side，on the seat，lay Presto， sleeping quietly．His dog's warm breath reassured him．The gnats crept over the surface of the water and danced in the sultry air，just as usual．Everything about him was quite clear and real．It must be true．And he felt all the time that Windekind's trustful look was on him．Then again he heard the sweet low voice：—

“I have often seen you here，Johannes．Do you know where I was？ Sometimes I sat on the sand at the bottom of the pool among the thicket of water-plants，and looked up at you when you bent over to drink，or to catch the water-beetles or the efts．But you did not see me．Then again I would hide near you among the reeds．There I was very comfortable；I sleep there most times when it is warm，in an empty reed-warbler's nest．And that is deliciously soft！”

Windekind rocked himself contentedly on the edge of the boat， hitting at the gnats with his flower．

“Now I have come to keep you company．Your life is too dull．We shall be good friends，and I will tell you a great many things—much better things than the schoolmaster teaches you．He knows nothing about them．And if you do not believe me I will let you see and hear for yourself．I will take you with me．”

“Oh，Windekind！Dear Windekind！Can you take me with you out there？”cried Johannes，pointing to the spot where the purple rays of the vanished sun had streamed out of the golden gate of clouds．The glorious structure was already fading into grey mist，but the rosy light still could be seen in the farthest depths．

Windekind looked at the glow，which tinged his delicate face and fair hair，and he gently shook his head．

“Not now，not now．You must not ask too much at once， Johannes．I myself have never been to my father's home．”

“I am always at my father's，”said Johannes．

“No；he is not your father．We are brothers．My father is your father too．But the earth is your mother and so we are very different．And you were born in a house among men，and I in a bindweed flower；and that is much better．But we shall get on very well together nevertheless．”

Then Windekind sprang lightly into the boat，which did not rock under his weight，and kissed Johannes on the forehead．

What a strange change then came over Johannes！Everything about him seemed different．He saw everything better and more clearly，as he fancied．He saw the moon look down with a kinder glance，and he saw that the water-lilies had faces，and gazed at him in pensive amazement．He now suddenly understood why the gnats danced so merrily up and down，and round and round each other， touching the water with the tips of their long legs．He had often wondered and thought about it，but now he understood it at once．

He heard too what the reeds whispered to the trees on the bank， softly complaining that the sun had gone down．

“Oh！Windekind，thank you，this is glorious．Yes；we shall be very happy together！”

“Give me your hand，”said Windekind，spreading his many-coloured wings．Then he drew Johannes in the boat over the pool through the splashing leaves which glistened in the moonlight．

Here and there a frog was sitting on a leaf；but he did not now leap into the water when Johannes came by．He only made a little bow and said，“Quaak．”Johannes politely bowed in return；above all，he would not seem ill-bred．

Then they came to the reeds；they grew so far out into the water that the whole boat was swallowed up in them without touching the shore．But Johannes held fast to his leader and they scrambled to land between the tall stems．

It seemed to Johannes that he had grown quite small and light， but perhaps that was fancy．Still，he could not remember that he had ever before been able to climb up a sedge．

“Now，keep your eyes open，”said Windekind，“and you shall see something pretty．”

They walked on among the tall grass and under dark brushwood which here and there let through a bright narrow streak of moonlight．

“Did you ever hear the crickets of an evening out on the sand-hills，Johannes？ It is as if they were giving a concert，isn't it？ And you can never find out exactly where the sound comes from．Now they do not sing for pleasure：the voices come from the crickets' school，where hundreds of little crickets are learning their lessons．Be quite still，for we are near them now．”

Shurr！Shurr！

The bushes were thinner here，and when Windekind pushed the grass stems aside with his flower，Johannes saw a beautiful open glade where，among the fine spiky grass of the down，the crickets were busy reading their lessons．

Shurr！Shurr！

A great stout cricket was master and teacher．One after another the pupils skipped up to him with one leap forward and one leap back again．The cricket who missed his leap had to stand on a toadstool．

“Now listen，Johannes，”said Windekind；“you too may perhaps learn something．”

Johannes could understand what the little crickets said．But it was not at all the same as the master at his school taught him．First came geography：they knew nothing of the quarters of the world．They only knew twenty-six sand-hills at most，and two ponds．No one could know of anything beyond，said the master，and what was told of it was mere idle fancy．

Then came the botany lesson．They were all very sharp at this， and many prizes were given，consisting of the youngest and sweetest blades of grass of various length．But the zoology was what most puzzled Johannes．The animals were classified as leaping，flying， and creeping．The crickets could leap and fly，and thus stood at the head of all；next to them the frogs．Birds were mentioned with every sign of horror，as most malignant and dangerous creatures．Finally man was spoken of．He was a huge useless and mischievous being， very low in the scale，as he could neither leap nor fly；but happily he was very rarely met with．A very tiny cricket，who had never yet seen a man，had three blows with a reed for including man among the harmless beasts．

Johannes had never heard anything like this before．

Then the master called out：“Silence！Leaping exercise！”

And the little crickets immediately ceased conning their lessons， and began to play leap-frog，in the cleverest and nimblest way，the big teacher at their head．

It was such a merry sight that Johannes clapped his hands with glee；but at that sound，the whole school vanished in an instant into the sand-hills，and the grass plot was as still as death．

“There，that is your doing，Johannes！You must not behave so roughly．It is easy enough to see that you were born among men．”

“I am so sorry！I will do my best．But it was so funny！”

“It will be still funnier，”said Windekind．

They crossed the grass plot and went up the down on the other side．Oof！it was hard walking in the heavy sand；but as soon as Johannes held on to the pale-blue robe he flew upwards，lightly and swiftly．Half-way up there was a rabbit-burrow．The rabbit who lived there was lying with his head and forepaws over the edge．The wild roses were still in bloom，and their sweet，delicate fragrance mingled with that of the thyme which grew on the sand-hill．

Johannes had often seen rabbits pop into their holes，and had wondered what the burrows looked like inside，and how they sat there together，and would they not be stifled？

So he was very glad when he heard his companion ask the rabbit whether they might step in．

“So far as I am concerned，and welcome，”said the rabbit．“But it most unfortunately happens that I have this very evening lent my burrow for a charitable entertainment，and so am not properly master in my own house．”

“Dear，dear！Has some disaster occurred？”

“Oh，yes！”said the rabbit sadly—“a terrible misfortune！It will take us years to get over it．About a dozen jumps from here，a man's house has been built，so big，so big！And its men are come to live there with dogs．Seven members of my family have already perished，and three times as many holes have been robbed．The mouse family and the mole tribe have fared no better．Even the toads have suffered．So now we are giving an entertainment for the benefit of the survivors．Every one does what he can；I have lent my burrow．One must find something to spare for one's fellow-creatures．”

The polite rabbit sighed and passed his long ear over his face with his right forepaw，as though to wipe a tear from his eye．It was his pocket-handkerchief．

There was a rustling sound in the grass and a fat，heavy body came shuffling up to the hole．

“Look，”said Windekind，“here comes daddy toad too，all humped up．Well，how are you getting on，old fellow？”

The toad made no reply．He carefully laid an ear of corn neatly wrapped in a dry leaf close to the entrance，and nimbly climbed over the rabbit's back into the hole．

“May we go in？”said Johannes，who was excessively inquisitive．“I will give something．”

He remembered that he still had a biscuit in his pocket—a little round biscuit，from Huntley and Palmer's．When he took it out he at once observed how much smaller he had grown．He could scarcely grasp it with both hands，and could not understand how his breeches pocket had still held it．

“That is most rare and precious！”cried the rabbit．“That is a princely donation！”

And he respectfully made way for them to pass．It was dark in the burrow，and Johannes let Windekind lead the way．Soon they saw a pale-green light approaching them．It was a glow-worm，who obligingly offered to light them．

“It promises to be a delightful evening，”said the glow-worm as they went forward．“There are a great number of guests．You are elves as it seems to me—are you not？”And the glow-worm glanced doubtfully at Johannes as he spoke．

“You may announce us as elves，”replied Windekind．

“Do you know that your king is of the party？”the glow-worm went on．

“Is Oberon here？ Well，I am pleased indeed，”cried Windekind．“He is a personal friend of mine．”

“Oh！”said the glow-worm．“I did not know that I had the honour—”and his light almost went out with alarm．“Yes，his Majesty prefers the outer air as a rule，but he is always to be seen at a beneficent meeting．It will be really a most brilliant affair．”

And so indeed it was．The chief apartment in the rabbit-burrow was beautifully decorated；the floor was patted flat and strewn with scented thyme，and over the entrance a bat hung head downwards．He called out the names of the guests，and at the same time his wings served as curtains—a most economical arrangement．The walls were tastefully lined with dry leaves，cobwebs，and tiny hanging bats．Glowworms innumerable crept between them and over the ceiling， forming a very pretty and twinkling illumination．At the end of this hall stood a throne made of fragments of decayed wood which gave a light of themselves．That was a very pretty sight．

There were a great many guests．Johannes felt very shy in this crowd of strangers，and clung closely to Windekind．He saw wonderful things there．A mole was talking to a field-mouse of the charming effect of the lighting and decorations．Two fat toads sat together in a corner，shaking their heads and lamenting over the persistent drought．A frog tried to walk round the room arm in arm with a lizard；but this was a failure，for he was embarrassed and excited，and now and then made too long a leap，whereby he somewhat damaged the wall decorations．

On the throne sat Oberon，the Elfin King，surrounded by his little train of elves who looked down on the rest of the company with some contempt．The King himself was full of royal condescension， and conversed in the most friendly way with several of the company．He had just arrived from a journey in the East，and wore a strange garment of brightly coloured flower-petals．“Such flowers do not grow here，”thought Johannes．On his head he had a dark blue flower-cup which still shed a fresh perfume as though it had but just been plucked．In his hand he carried the stamen of a lotus-flower as a sceptre．

All the company were struck with silent admiration of his condescension．He had praised the moonlight over the downs，and had said that the glow-worms here were as beautiful as the fire-flies in the East．He had also glanced with approval at the decorations， and a mole had observed that he had nodded his head very graciously．

“Come along，”said Windekind to Johannes．“I will present you．”And they made their way to the King's throne．

Oberon opened his arms with joy when he saw Windekind， and embraced him．There was a murmur among the guests，and unfriendly glances from the Elfin court．The two fat toads in the corner muttered something about“flattery”and“servility”and“it would not last”—and nodded significantly to each other．Windekind talked to Oberon for a long time in an unknown language，and then beckoned to Johannes to come forward．

“Shake hands，Johannes，”said the King．“Windekind's friends are my friends．So far as I can，I will gladly serve you．I will give you a token of our alliance．”

Oberon took a tiny gold key from the chain he wore about his neck and gave it to Johannes，who received it with great respect and clasped it tightly in his hand．

“That key may bring you luck，”the King went on．“It opens a golden casket which contains a priceless treasure．But where that is I cannot tell you；you must search for it diligently．If you remain good friends with me，and with Windekind，and are steadfast and true，you may very likely succeed．”

The Elfin King nodded his handsome head with hearty kindness， and Johannes thanked him，greatly delighted．

Hereupon three frogs，who sat perched on a little cushion of moist moss，began to sing the prelude to a slow waltz，and the couples stood up．Those who did not dance were requested by a green lizard—who acted as master of the ceremonies and who rushed hither and thither very busily—to move into the corners；to the great indignation of the two toads，who complained that they could not see；and then the dancing began．

It was very droll at first．Each one danced after his own fashion and naturally imagined that he did it better than any one else．The mice and frogs leaped as high as they could on their hind legs；an old rat spun round so roughly that all the rest had to keep out of his way；and even a fat slug ventured to take a turn with a mole，but soon gave it up，excusing herself by saying that she had a stitch in her side—the real reason was that she could not do it well．

However，the dance went on very gravely and ceremoniously．Every one regarded it as a matter of conscience，and glanced anxiously at the King to see some token of approval on his countenance．But the King was afraid of causing jealousies，and looked quite unmoved．His suite thought it beneath them to dance with the rest．

Johannes had stood among them quite quietly for a long time；but he saw a little toad waltzing with a tall lizard who sometimes lifted the hapless toad so-high above the ground that she described a semicircle in the air，and his amusement burst out in a hearty laugh．

What an excitement it caused！The music ceased．The King looked angrily about him．The master of the ceremonies flew in all haste to implore Johannes to behave less frivolously．

“Dancing is a very serious thing，”said he，“and certainly no subject for laughter．This is a very distinguished party，where people do not dance for amusement．Every one is doing his best and no one expects to be laughed at．It is extremely rude．Besides，this is a mourning feast，on a very melancholy occasion．You must behave suitably，and not as if you were among men and women．”

Johannes was quite alarmed．On every side he met disapproving looks；his intimacy with the King had already made him some enemies．Windekind led him aside．

“We shall do better to go，Johannes，”he whispered．“You have spoilt it all．Yes，yes；that comes of having been brought up among men．”

They hastily slipped out under the wings of the porter bat，into the dark passage．The glow-worm in waiting attended them to the door．“Have you been amused？”he asked．“Did King Oberon speak to you？”

“Oh，yes；it was a beautiful party，”replied Johannes．“Must you stay here in the dark passage all the time？”

“It is my own free choice，”said the glow-worm in a tone of bitter melancholy．“I have given up all such vanities．”

“Come，”said Windekind；“you do not mean that．”

“Indeed I do．Formerly—formerly—there was a time when I too went to banquets，and danced and cared for such frivolities．But now I am crushed by suffering—now—”And he was so much overcome that his light went out．

Fortunately they were close to the opening，and the rabbit，who heard them coming，stood a little on one side so that the moonlight shone in．

As soon as they were outside with the rabbit，Johannes said—“Tell us your history，Glow-worm．”

“Alas！”sighed the glow-worm，“it is simple and sad．It will not amuse you．”

“Tell it，tell it all the same，”they all cried．

“Well—you all know of course，that we glow-worms are very remarkable creatures．Yes，I believe that no one will venture to dispute that we are the most gifted creatures in existence．”

“Pray why？ I do not see that！”said the rabbit．

“Can you give light？”asked the glow-worm contemptuously．

“No，certainly not，”the rabbit was forced to admit．

“Well，we give light！all of us．And we can let it shine or extinguish it at will．Light is the best of nature's gifts，and to give light is the highest function to which a living creature can attain．Can any one now doubt our pre-eminence？ Besides，we，the males， have wings and can fly for miles．”

“That I cannot do，”the rabbit humbly owned．

“For the divine gift of light which we possess，all other creatures look up to us；no bird may attack us．One animal alone，the lowest of them all，seeks us out and carries us off．That is man—the vilest monster in creation！”

At this Johannes looked round at Windekind as though he did not understand the meaning of it．But Windekind smiled and nodded to him to say nothing．

“Once I flew gaily about the world like a bright will-o'-the-wisp among the dark bushes．And in a lonely damp meadow，on the bank of a stream，dwelt she whose existence was inseparably bound up with my happiness．She glittered in exquisite emerald green light as she crept among the grass stems，and she entirely possessed my youthful heart．I fluttered round her and did my utmost to attract her attention by changing my light．I gladly perceived that she noticed my salutation and eclipsed her own light．Tremulous with devotion， I was about to fold my wings and drop in ecstasy at the side of my radiant and adored one，when a tremendous noise filled the air．Dark figures were approaching：they were men．I fled in terror．They rushed after me and struck at me with great black tilings，but my wings were swifter than their clumsy legs．—When I returned—”

Here the narrator's voice failed him．It was only after a pause of silent meditation，while his three hearers reverently kept silence，that he went on：

“You have guessed the rest．My gentle bride，the brightest and most sparkling of her kind，had disappeared，carried away by cruel men．The peaceful，moist grass plot was trodden down，and her favourite place by the stream was dark and desolate．I was alone in the world．”

Here the tender-hearted rabbit again used his ear to wipe a tear from his eyes．

“From that night I am an altered creature．I have a horror of all vain amusements．I think only of her whom I have lost，and of the time when I may see her again．”

“What，have you still a hope？”asked the rabbit in surprise．

“I have more than hope；I have assurance．Up there I shall see my beloved once more．”

“But—”the rabbit put in．

“Rab，”said the glow-worm solemnly，“I can understand the doubts of those who must feel their way in the dark．But to those who can see with their own eyes！—then all doubt is to me incomprehensible．There！”cried the glow-worm，looking reverently up at the twinkling，starry sky，“I see them there！All my ancestors， all my friends，—and she among them—they shine up there in still greater radiance than here on earth．Ah！when shall I be released from this lower life and fly to her who twinkles at me so tenderly．When，ah！when？”

The glow-worm turned away with a sigh，and crept back into the dark again．

“Poor fellow！”said the rabbit，“I hope he may be right．”

“I hope so too，”added Johannes．

“I have my fears，”said Windekind．“But it was very interesting．”

“Dear Windekind，”Johannes began，“I am very tired and sleepy．”

“Come close to me，then，and I will cover you with my cloak．”

Windekind took off his blue mantle and spread it over Johannes and himself．So they lay down together in the sweet moss on the down，their arms round each other's necks．

“Your heads lie rather low，”cried the rabbit．“Will you rest them against me？”And so they did．

“Good-night，mother！”said Windekind to the Moon．

And Johannes shut his hand tight on the little golden key，laid his head on the downy fur of the good-natured rabbit，and slept soundly．





III


“Well，where is he，Presto？ Where is your little master then？”How alarming to wake in the boat among the reeds—quite alone—the master vanished entirely！this is something indeed to be frightened at．And now run about，hunting on all sides with timid little whinings，poor Presto！How could you sleep so soundly as not to notice when your master left the boat？ Generally you are wont to wake if only he moves a little．Here—you can see here where your master landed；but now you are on land the track is very much confused．All your busy snuffing is in vain！What a misfortune！The little master gone，quite lost！Seek，Presto，seek him then！“Look！ There，against that low mound just before you—Is there not a little dark figure lying？ Look at it closely！”

For a moment the dog stood motionless，looking eagerly into the distance．Then he suddenly stretched out his head and flew as fast as his four slender legs could carry him to the dark object on the mound．

And when he found that it really was the little master he had so sorely missed，all his powers were too feeble to express his joy and thankfulness．He wagged his tail，his whole body wriggled with glee，he leaped，barked，yelped，and laid his cold nose against his re-found friend，licking and sniffing all over his face．

“Down，Presto！Go to your basket！”cried Johannes，but half awake．

How stupid of master！There was no basket to be seen，look where he might．

Slowly，slowly，light began to dawn on the little sleeper's mind．Presto's sniffing！—he was used to that，every morning．Faint images still floated before his soul，dream-pictures of elves and moonlight， like morning mists over a landscape of sand-hills．He feared that the cold breath of day would waft them away．“Keep your eyes shut，”said he to himself，“or you will see the clock against the wall where it always hangs！”

But there was something strange about his bed．He felt that he had no bed-clothes over him．Gently and warily he opened his eyes， just a little way．

Bright daylight．Blue sky．Clouds．

Then Johannes opened his eyes very wide and said：“Then it was true？”Yes．He was lying among the sand-hills．The cheerful sunshine warmed him；he breathed the fresh morning air；a filmy mist hung over the woods beyond．He saw the tall beech-tree by the pool，and the roof of his own home rising above the shrubbery．Bees and beetles were buzzing around him，overhead a lark was singing；in the distance he could hear dogs barking and the hum of the neighbouring town．It was all real，beyond a doubt．

What then had he dreamed，and what was true？ Where was Windekind？ And the rabbit？

He saw nothing of either．Only Presto，who sat as close to him as possible and looked at him expectantly．

“Can I have been walking in my sleep？”Johannes murmured softly to himself．

By his side there was a rabbit's burrow；but there were so many in the down．He sat up to see more plainly．What was this in his tightly clasped fingers？

A glow flashed through him from head to foot as he opened his hand．In it lay a bright little gold key．For a few moments he sat silent．

“Presto，”said he then，and the tears almost came into his eyes，“Presto．Then it was true！”

Presto sprang up，and tried by barking to make his master understand that he was hungry and wanted to go home．

Home？ To be sure．Johannes had not thought of that，and he did not particularly care to go．However，he presently heard his name called by loud voices．Then he began to understand that his proceedings would certainly not be regarded as right and satisfactory， and that far from kindly words awaited him on his return．

For a moment he could hardly be sure whether his tears of joy had not，in vexation，turned to tears of fear and contrition；but then he remembered Windekind，who was now his friend，his friend and ally；and the Elfin King's gift；and the splendid，indisputable reality of all that had happened；—and so he made his way homeward calmly，and prepared for whatever might betide．

It fell out as he had anticipated．But he had not imagined that the distress and alarm of the house-hold could be so serious a matter．He must solemnly promise never again to be so naughty and heedless．This quite restored his presence of mind．“That I cannot promise，”he said very resolutely．They looked at him in amazement．He was questioned，coaxed，threatened．But he thought of Windekind and was firm．What did he care for punishment so long as he had Windekind for his friend—and what would he not endure for Windekind's sake？ He clutched the little key tightly to his breast and shut his mouth firmly，answering every question with a shrug of his shoulders．“I cannot promise，”was all he replied．

But his father said：“Leave him in peace；he is quite in earnest about it．Something strange must have happened to him．He will tell us all about it some day．”

Johannes smiled，ate his breakfast in silence，and crept up to his little room．There he nipped off a bit of the blind-cord，slipped it through his precious little key and hung it round his neck next to his breast．Then he very contentedly went to school．

Things went ill with him at school that day．He knew none of his lessons and paid no attention at all．His thoughts were constantly wandering to the pool，and the wonderful things which had happened last evening．He could scarcely believe that a friend of the fairy king's could be expected and required to do sums and conjugate verbs．But it had all been true，and no one there knew anything about it，or would believe it or understand it；not even the master，however cross he might be，calling Johannes an idle little boy in a tone of great contempt．He took the bad marks he had earned with a light heart，and did the task set him as a punishment for his inattention．

“You，none of you understand anything about it．You may scold me as much as you please．I am Windekind's friend，and Windekind is worth more to me than all of you put together．Ay，with the master into the bargain！”

This was not respectful of Johannes．But his estimation of his fellow-creatures had not been raised by all the evil he had heard said of them the evening before．But，as is often the case，he was not yet wise enough to use his wisdom wisely，or，better still，to keep it to himself．

When the master went on to say that man alone of all creatures was endowed by God with speech，and appointed lord over all other animals，Johannes began to laugh．This cost him a bad mark and serious reproof．And when his next neighbour read the following sentence out of an exercise-book：“The age of my wilful aunt is great，but not so great as that of the Sun”—parsing“the Sun”correctly as feminine，Johannes shouted out loudly，correcting him：“Masculine，masculine！”

Every one laughed excepting the master，who was amazed at such utter stupidity as he thought it，and he desired Johannes to remain in school and write out a hundred times：“The age of my wilful aunt is great，but not so great as that of the Sun（feminine）， and greater still is my arrogant stupidity．”

His school-fellows had departed，and Johannes sat alone writing，in the great empty school-room．The sun shone in brightly， making the dust-motes glitter in its beams，and painting the wall with patches of light which crept round as time went on．The master， too，was gone，slamming the door behind him．Johannes had just got to the fifty-second“wilful aunt”when a tiny，brisk mouse，with black，beady little eyes and erect ears，came out of the farthest corner of the room and ran noiselessly along by the wall．Johannes kept as still as death，not to scare the pretty little thing；but it was not shy and came close to where he was sitting．It looked sharply about for a minute or two，with its small，bright eyes；then with one spring leaped on to the bench，and with a second on to the desk on which Johannes was writing．

“Well done！”said he half to himself，“you are a very bold little mouse．”

“I ought to know whom I should be afraid of，”said a wee-wee voice，and the mouse showed his little white teeth as if he were laughing．

Johannes was by this time quite used to marvels；still，this made him open his eyes very wide．Here，in school，in the middle of the day—it was incredible．

“You need not be afraid of me，”said he，very gently for fear of frightening the mouse．“Did Windekind send you？”

“I am sent to tell you that the master was quite right，and that you thoroughly deserved your extra task．”

“But it was Windekind who told me that the sun was masculine．He said he was his father．”

“Yes；but no one else need know it．What have men to do with that？ You must never discuss such delicate matters with men；they are too gross to understand them．Man is an astonishingly perverse and stupid creature that only cares to catch or kill whatever comes within his reach．Of that we mice have ample experience．”

“But why then，little mouse，do you live among men？ Why do you not run away to the woods？”

“Oh，that we cannot do now．We are too much accustomed to town living．And so long as we are prudent，and always take care to avoid their traps and their heavy feet，we get on very well among men．Fortunately we are very nimble．The worst of it is，that man ekes out his own slowness by an alliance with the cat；that is a great grievance．But in the woods there are owls and hawks，and we should all be starved．Now，Johannes，mind my advice—here comes the master．”

“Mouse，mouse；do not go away．Ask Windekind what I am to do with my little key．I have tied it round my neck，next my skin．But on Saturday I am tubbed，and I am so afraid that it will be found．Tell me，where can I hide it？”

“Underground，always underground，that is always safest．Shall I keep it for you？”

“No，not here in school．”

“Then bury it out in the sand-hills．I will tell my cousin the field-mouse that he must take care of it．”

“Thank you，little mouse．”

Tramp，tramp！In came the master．While Johannes was dipping his pen the mouse had vanished．The master，who wanted to go home，let Johannes off the other forty-eight lines．

For two days Johannes lived in constant dread．He was kept strictly within sight，and had no opportunity of slipping off to the sand-hills．It was already Friday，and still the precious key was about his neck．The following evening he would inevitably be stripped；the key would be discovered and taken from him—his blood turned cold at the thought．He dared not hide it in the house or garden—no place seemed to him safe enough．

Friday afternoon，and dusk was creeping down！Johannes sat at his bedroom window，gazing with longing at the distance，over the green shrubs in the garden to the downs beyond．

“Windekind，Windekind，help me！”he whispered anxiously．

He heard a soft rustling of wings close at hand，he smelt the scent of lilies of the valley，and suddenly heard the sweet，well-known voice．

Windekind sat by him on the window-sill，waving the bells of a lily of the valley on their slender stems．

“Here you are at last！”cried Johannes；“I have longed for you so much！”

“Come with me，Johannes，we will bury your little key．”

“I cannot，”said Johannes sadly．

But Windekind took him by the hand and he felt himself wafted through the still evening air，as light as the wind-blown down of a dandelion．

“Windekind，”said Johannes，as they floated on，“I love you so dearly．I believe I would give all the people in the world for you，and Presto into the bargain．”

“And Simon？”

“Oh，Simon does not care whether I love him or not．I believe he thinks it too childish．Simon loves no one but the fish-woman， and that only when he is hungry．Do you think that Simon is a common cat，Windekind？”

“No，formerly he was a man．”

Whrrr—bang！There went a fat cockchafer buzzing against Johannes．

“Can you not look where you are going？”grumbled the cockchafer，“those Elves fly abroad as though the whole air were theirs by right．That is always the way with idlers who go flitting about for pleasure；those who，like me，are about their business， seeking their food and eating as hard as they can，are pushed out of their road．”

And he flew off，scolding loudly．

“Does he think the worse of us because we do not eat？”asked Johannes．

“Yes，that is the way of cockchafers．According to them，the highest duty is to eat a great deal．Shall I tell you the history of a young cockchafer？”

“Ay，do，”said Johannes．

“There was a pretty young cockchafer who had just crept out of the earth．That was a great surprise．For a whole year he had sat waiting in the dark earth，watching for the first warm summer evening．And when he put his head out of the clod，all the greenery， and the waving grass，and the singing-birds quite bewildered him．He had no idea what to be about．He touched the blades of grass with his feelers，spreading them out in a fan．Then he observed that he was a male cockchafer，very handsome in his way，with shining black legs，a large，fat body，and a breastplate that shone like a mirror．As luck would have it，he at once saw，not far off，another cockchafer，not indeed so handsome as himself，but who had come out the day before and who was quite old．Very modestly，being still so young，he crept towards the other．

“‘What do you want，my friend？’said the second cockchafer rather haughtily，seeing that the other was a youngster，‘do you wish to ask me the way？’

“‘No，I am obliged to you，’said the younger one civilly，‘but I do not know what I ought to be doing．What is there for cockchafers to do？’

“‘Dear me，’said the other，‘do not you know that much？ Well， I cannot blame you，for I was young myself once．Listen，then，and I will tell you．The principal thing in a cockchafer's life is to eat．Not far from this is a delicious lime-walk which was placed there for us， and it is our duty to eat there as diligently as we can．’

“‘Who put the lime-walk there？’asked the younger beetle．

“‘Well，a great being who means very kindly to us．He comes down the Avenue every morning，and those who have eaten most he takes away to a splendid house where a beautiful light shines，and where chafers are all happy together．Those，on the other hand，who， instead of eating，spend the night in flying about are caught by the Bat．’

“‘What is that？’asked the young one．

“‘A fearful monster with sharp teeth who comes flying down on us all on a sudden and eats us up with a horrible crunch．’

“As the chafer spoke they heard a shrill squeak overhead which chilled them to the very marrow．‘Hark！There he is！’cried the elder，‘beware of him，my young friend，and be thankful that I have given you timely warning．You have the whole night before you．Make good use of your time．The less you eat，the greater the risk of the bat's seizing you．And none but those who choose a serious vocation in life ever go to the house where the beautiful light is．Mark that；a serious vocation．’

“Then the chafer，who was by a whole day the elder，disappeared among the blades of grass，leaving the other greatly impressed．“Do you know what a vocation is，Johannes？ No？ Well，the young chafer did not know．It had something to do with eating—he understood that．But how was he to find the lime-walk？

“Close at hand stood a slender but stalwart grass-stem，waving softly in the evening air．This he firmly clutched with his six crooked legs．It seemed a long journey up to the top，and very steep．But the cockchafer was determined to reach it．‘This is a vocation！’he thought to himself，and began to climb with much toil．He went but slowly and often slipped back；but he got on，and when at last he found himself on the slender tip，and rocked with its swaying，he felt triumphant and happy．What a view he had from thence！It seemed to him that he could see the whole world．How blissful it was to be surrounded by air on all sides！He eagerly breathed his fill．What a wonderful feeling had come over him！Now he craved to go higher！ In his rapture he raised his wing-cases and quivered his gauzy wings．Higher！and yet higher I His wings fluttered，his legs released the grass-stem，and then—oh joy！Whoo-oo I He was flying—freely and gladly，in the still，warm evening air！”

“And then？”said Johannes．

“The end is not happy．I will tell it you some day later．”

They were hovering over the pool．A pair of white butterflies fluttered to meet them．

“Whither are you travelling，elves？”they asked．

“To the large wild rose-tree which blooms by yonder mound．”

“We will go with you；we will go too！”

The rose-bush was already in sight in the distance，with its abundance of pale-yellow sheeny blossoms．The buds were red and the open flowers were dashed with red，as if they remembered the time when they were still buds．The wild down-rose bloomed in peaceful solitude，and filled the air with its wonderfully sweet odours．They are so fine that the down-elves live on nothing else．The butterflies fluttered about and kissed flower after flower．

“We have come to place a treasure in your charge，”cried Windekind．“Will you keep it safe for us？”

“Why not—why not？”whispered the rose．“It is no pain to me to keep awake—and I have no thought of going away unless I am dragged away．And I have sharp thorns．”

Then came the field-mouse—the cousin of the school-mouse—and burrowed quite under the roots of the rose-tree．And there he buried the little key．

“When you want it again you must call me；for you must on no account hurt the rose．”

The rose twined its thorny arms thickly over the entrance and took a solemn oath to guard it faithfully．The butterflies were witnesses．

Next morning Johannes awoke in his own little bed，with Presto，and the clock against the wall．The cord with the key was gone from round his neck．





IV


“Children！children！A summer like this is a terrible infliction！”sighed one of three large stoves which stood side by side to bewail their fate in a garret of the old house．“For weeks I have not seen one living soul or heard one rational remark．And always that hollow within！It is fearful！”

“I am full of spiders' webs，”said the second．“And that would never happen in the winter．”

“And I am so dry and dusty that I shall be quite ashamed when， as winter comes on，the Black Man appears again，as the poet says．”

A few shovels and tongs which lay on the floor，wrapped in paper to preserve them from rust，also expressed their opinion of this frivolous mode of speech．

But suddenly they were all silent，for the shutter in the roof was raised；a beam of light shone in on the gloomy place，and the whole party lapsed into silence under their dust and confusion．

It was Johannes who had come to disturb their conversation．This loft was at all times a delightful spot to him，and now，after the strange adventures of the last few days，he often came here．Here he found peace and solitude．There was a window，too，closed by a shutter，which looked out towards the sand-hills．It was a great delight to open the shutter suddenly，and，after the mysterious twilight of the garret，to see all at once the sunlit landscape shut in by the fair，rolling dimes．

It was three weeks since that Friday evening，and Johannes had seen nothing of his friend since．The key was gone，and there was nothing now to assure him that he had not dreamed it all．Often， indeed，he could not conquer a fear that it was all nothing but fancy．He grew very silent，and his father was alarmed，for he observed that since that night out of doors Johannes had certainly had something the matter with him．But Johannes was only pining for Windekind．

“Can he be less fond of me than I of him？”he murmured，as he stood at the garret window and looked out over the green and flowery garden．“Why is it that he never comes near me now？ If I could—but perhaps he has other friends，and perhaps he loves them more than me．I have no other friend，not one．I love no one but him！ I love him so much—oh so much！”

Then，against the deep blue sky he saw a flight of six white doves，who wheeled，flapping their wings，above the roof over his head．It seemed as though they were moved by one single impulse， so quickly did they veer and turn all together，as if to enjoy to the utmost the sea of sunshine and summer air in which they were flying．

Suddenly they swept down towards Johannes's window in the roof，and settled with much flapping and fussing on the water-pipe，where they pattered to and fro with endless cooings．One of them had a red feather in his wing．He plucked and pulled at it till he had pulled it out，and then he flew to Johannes and gave it to him．

Hardly had Johannes taken it in his hand when he felt that he was as light and swift as one of the doves．He stretched out his arms， the doves flew up，and Johannes found himself in their midst，in the spacious free air and glorious sunshine．There was nothing around him but the pure blue，and the bright shimmer of fluttering white wings．

They flew across the great garden，towards the wood，where the thick tree-tops waved in the distance like the swell of a green sea．Johannes looked down and saw his father through the open window， sitting in the house-place，—Simon was lying in the window seat with his crossed forepaws，basking in the sun．

“I wonder if they see me！”thought he；but he dared not call out to them．

Presto was trotting about the garden walks，sniffing at every shrub and behind every wall，and scratching against the door of every shed or greenhouse to find his master．

“Presto，Presto！”cried Johannes．The dog looked up and began to wag his tail and yelp most dolefully．

“I am coming back，Presto！only wait，”cried Johannes，but he was too far away．

They soared over the wood，and the rooks flew cawing out of the top branches where they had built their nests．It was high summer，and the scent of the blossoming limes came up in steamy gusts from the green wood．In an empty nest，at the top of a tall lime-tree，sat Windekind，with his wreath of bindweed．He nodded to Johannes．

“There you are！that is good，”said he．“I sent for you；now we can remain together for a long time—if you like．”

“I like it very much，”said Johannes．

Then he thanked the friendly doves who had brought him hither，and went down with Windekind into the woods．There it was cool and shady．The oriole piped his tune，almost always the same， but still a little different．

“Poor bird！”said Windekind．“He was once a bird of Paradise．That you still may see by his strange yellow feathers；but he was transformed and turned out of Paradise．There is a word which can restore him to his former splendid plumage，and open Paradise to him once more；but he has forgotten the word；and now，day after day，he tries to find his way back there．He says something like the word，but it is not quite right．”

Numberless insects glittered like dancing crystals in the sun's rays where they pierced between the thick leaves．When they listened sharply they could hear a humming，like a great concert on one string，filling the whole wood．This was the song of the sunbeams．

The ground was covered with deep dark-green moss，and Johannes had again grown so tiny that it appeared to him like another wood on the ground，beneath the greater wood．What elegant little stems！and how closely they grew！It was difficult to make a way between them，and the moss forest seemed terribly large．

Presently they crossed an ants' track．Hundreds of ants were hurrying up and down，some dragging chips of wood or little blades of grass in their jaws．There was such a bustle that Johannes was almost bewildered．

It was a long time before one of the ants would spare them a word．They were all too busy．At last they found an old ant who was set to watch the plant-lice from which the ants get honeydew．As his herd was a very quiet one he could very well give a little time to the strangers，and let them see the great nest．It was situated at the foot of an old tree-trunk，and was very large，with hundreds of passages and cells．The plant-louse herd led the way，and conducted the visitors into every part of it，even into the nurseries where the young larvæ were creeping out of their cocoons．Johannes was amazed and delighted．

The old ant told them that every one was very busy by reason of the campaign which was immediately at hand．Another colony of ants，dwelling not far off，was to be attacked by a strong force， their nest destroyed and the larvæ carried off or killed；and as all the strength at their command must be employed，all the most necessary tasks must be got through beforehand．

“What is the campaign about？”said Johannes．“I do not like fighting．”

“Nay，nay！”replied the herdsman．“It is a very grand and praiseworthy war．You must remember that it is the soldier-ants we are going to attack；we shall exterminate the race，and that is a very good work．”

“Then you are not soldier-ants？”

“Certainly not．What are you thinking about？ We are the peace-loving ants．”

“What do you mean by that？”

“Do not you know？ Well，I will explain．Once upon a time all ants were continually fighting，not a day passed without some great battle．Then there came a good，wise ant，who thought that he should save much sorrow if he could persuade them all to agree among themselves to fight no more．But when he said so every one thought him very odd，and for that reason they proceeded to bite him in pieces．Still，after this，other ants came who said the same thing，and they too were bitten to pieces．But at last so many were of this opinion that biting them to pieces was too hard work for the others．So then they called themselves the Peaceful Ants，and they did everything which their first teacher had done，and those who opposed them they，in their turn，bit in pieces．In this way almost all the ants at the present time have become Peaceful Ants，and the fragments of the first Peaceful Ant are carefully and reverently preserved．We have his head—the genuine head．We have devastated and annihilated twelve other colonies who pretended to have the True Head．Now there are but four who dare to do so．They call themselves Peaceful Ants，but in fact they are Fighting Ants by nature—but we have the True Head，and the Peaceful Ant had but one head．Now we are going to-morrow to destroy the thirteenth colony．So you see it is a good work．”

“Yes，yes，”said Johannes．“It is very strange！”

He was in fact a little uneasy，and felt happier when，after thanking the herd-keeper，they had taken their leave，and were sitting far from the Ant colony，rocked on the top of a tall grass-stem，under the shade of a graceful fern．

“Hooh！”sighed Johannes，“that was a bloodthirsty and stupid tribe！”

Windekind laughed，and swung up and down on the grass haulm．

“Oh！”said he，“you must not call them stupid．Men go to the ants to get wisdom．”

Then Windekind showed Johannes all the wonders of the wood；they flew up to visit the birds in the tree-tops and in the thick shrubs， went down into the moles' clever dwellings，and saw the bees' nest in the old hollow tree．

At last they came out on an open place surrounded by brush-wood．Honeysuckle grew there in great abundance．Its luxuriant trails climbed over everything，and the scented flowers peeped from among the greenery．A swarm of tomtits hopped and fluttered among the leaves with a great deal of twittering and chirping．

“Let us stay here a little while，”said Johannes；“this is splendid．”

“Very well，”said Windekind．“And you shall see something very droll．”

There were blue-bells in the grass．Johannes sat down by one of them and began to talk with the bees and the butterflies．They were friends of the blue-bells'，so the conversation went on at a great rate．

What was that？ A huge shadow came across the grass，and something like a white cloud fell down on the blue-bell—Johannes had scarcely time to get away，—he flew to Windekind who was sitting high up in a honeysuckle flower．Then he saw that the white cloud was a pocket-handkerchief，and bump！A sturdy damsel sat down on the handkerchief and on the poor blue-bell which was under it．

He had not time to bewail it before the sound of voices and the cracking of branches filled the glade in the forest．A crowd of men and women appeared．

“Now we shall have something to laugh at，”said Windekind．

The party came on，the ladies with umbrellas in their hands，the men with tall chimney-pot hats，and almost all in black，completely black．In the green sunny wood they looked like great，ugly ink-spots on a beautiful picture．

The brushwood was broken down，flowers trodden underfoot；many white handkerchiefs were spread，and the yielding grass and patient moss sighed as they were crushed under the weight they had to bear，fearing much that they might never recover from the blow．

The smoke of cigars curled among the honeysuckle wreaths，and enviously supplanted the delicate odour of their blossoms．Sharp voices scared the gleeful tomtits，who，with terrified and indignant piping，took refuge in the nearest trees．

One man rose and went to stand on a little mound．He had long light hair，and a pale face．He said something，and then all the men and women opened their mouths very wide and began to sing so loud，that the rooks flew cawing out of their high nests，and the inquisitive little rabbits，who had come from the sand-hills to see what was going on，ran off in alarm，and were still running fully a quarter of an hour after they were safe at home again in the dunes．

Windekind laughed and fanned away the cigar-smoke with a fern leaf；but there were tears in Johannes's eyes，though not from the tobacco．

“Windekind，”said he，“I want to go．This is all so ugly and so rude．”

“No，no，we must stay．You will laugh；it will be more amusing．”

The singing ceased and the pale man began to speak．He shouted hard，that every one might hear him；but what he said sounded very kind．He called them all his brothers and sisters， spoke of the glories of nature and the wonders of creation，of God's sunshine and the dear little birds and flowers．

“What is this？”asked Johannes．“How can he talk of these things？ Does he know you？ Is he a friend of yours？”

Windekind shook his flower-crowned head disdainfully．

“He does not know me，and the sun and the birds and the flowers even less．What he says is all lies．”

The people listened very attentively．The stout lady who sat on the blue-bell began to cry several times，and wiped her eyes on her skirt，as she could not get at her handkerchief．

The pale man said that God had made the sun shine so brightly for the sake of their meeting here，and Windekind laughed and threw an acorn down from the thick leaves，which hit the tip of his nose．

“He shall learn to know better，”said he；“my father shines for him，indeed！a fine idea！”

But the pale man was too much excited to pay any heed to the acorn，which seemed to have dropped from the sky；he talked a long time，and the longer the louder．At last he was red and purple in the face，doubled his fists，and shouted so loud that the leaves quivered and the grass stems were dismayed，and waved to and fro．When at last he came to an end they all began to sing again．

“Well，fie！”said a blackbird，who was listening from the top of a high tree，“that is a shocking noise to make！I had rather the cows should come into our wood．Only listen．Well，for shame！”

Now the blackbird knows what he is talking about，and has a fine taste in music．

After singing，the folks brought all sorts of eatables out of baskets，boxes and bags．Sheets of paper were spread out；cakes and oranges were handed round．And bottles and glasses also made their appearance．

Then Windekind called his allies together，and they began to attack the feasters．

A smart frog leaped up into an old maid's lap，flopped on to the bread she was just about to put into her mouth，and sat there as if amazed at his own audacity．The lady gave a fearful yell，and stared at the intruder without daring to stir．This bold beginning soon found imitators．Green caterpillars crept fearlessly over hats，handkerchiefs and rolls，inspiring terror and disgust；fat field-spiders let themselves down on glittering threads into beer glasses，and on to heads or necks，and a loud shriek always followed their appearance；endless winged creatures fairly attacked the human beings in the face， sacrificing their lives for the good cause by throwing themselves on the food and in the liquor，making them useless by their corpses．Finally the ants came in innumerable troops and stung the enemy in the most unexpected places，by hundreds at once．This gave rise to the greatest consternation and confusion．Men and women alike fled from the long crushed moss and grass．The poor blue-bell，too，was released in consequence of a well-directed attack by two ear-wigs on the stout maiden's legs．The men and women grew desperate；by dancing and leaping with the most extraordinary gestures，they tried to escape their persecutors．The pale man stood still for a long time，hitting about him with a small black stick；but a few audacious tomtits，who were not above any form of attack，and a wasp，who stung him in the calf through his black trousers，placed him hors de combat．

Then the sun could no longer keep his countenance，and hid his face behind a cloud．Large drops of rain fell on the antagonistic parties．It looked as though the shower had suddenly made a forest of great black toadstools spring out of the ground．These were the umbrellas，which were hastily opened．The women turned their skirts over their heads，thus displaying their white petticoats， white-stockinged legs，and shoes without heels．Oh，what fun for Windekind！He had to hold on to a flower-stem to laugh．

The rain fell more and more heavily；the forest was shrouded in a grey sparkling veil．Streams of water ran off the umbrellas，tall hats and black overcoats，which shone like the shell of a water-snail；their shoes slopped and smacked in the soaking ground．Then the people gave it up，and dropped off doubtfully in twos and threes， leaving behind them a litter of papers，empty bottles and orange peel，the hideous relics of their visit．The open glade in the forest was soon deserted once more，and ere long nothing was to be heard but the monotonous rush of the rain．

“Well，Johannes！now we have seen what men are like．Why do you not laugh at them？”

“Oh，Windekind！Are all men like these？”

“Indeed，there are worse and uglier．Sometimes they shout and rave，and destroy everything that is pretty or good．They cut down trees and stick their horrible square houses in their place；they wilfully crush the flowers，and kill every creature that comes within their reach，merely for pleasure．In their dwellings，where they crowd one upon another，it is all dirty and black，and the air is tainted and poisoned by the smell of smoke．They are complete strangers to nature and their fellow-creatures．That is why they cut such a foolish，miserable figure when they come forth to see them．”

“Oh dear！Windekind，Windekind．”

“Why do you cry，Johannes？ You must not cry because you were born to be a man．I love you all the same and choose you out of them all．I have taught you to understand the language of the butterflies and birds，and the faces of the flowers．The moon knows you，and the good kind earth regards you as her dearest child．Why should you not be glad since I am your friend？”

“You are，Windekind，you are！—still I cannot help crying over men．”

“Why？ You need not remain among them if it vexes you．You can live here with me，and always keep me company．We will make our home in the thickest of the wood，in the solitary，sunny downs， or among the reeds by the pool．I will take you everywhere，down under the water among the water-plants，in the palaces of the elves and in the earth-spirits' homes．I will waft you over fields and forests，over strange lands and seas．I will make the spiders spin fine raiment for you，and give you wings such as I have．We will live on the scent of flowers，and dance with the elves in the moonlight．When autumn comes we will follow the summer，to where the tall palm-trees stand，where gorgeous bunches of flowers hang from the cliffs，and the dark blue ocean sparkles in the sun．And I will always tell you fairy tales．Will you like that，Johannes？”

“And I shall never live among men any more？”

“Among men，endless vexations await you，weariness，troubles and sorrow．Day after day you will toil and sigh under the burden of life．Your tender soul will be wounded and tortured by their rough ways．You will be worn and grieved to death．Do you love men more than you love me？”

“No，no！Windekind，I will stay with you．”

Now he could prove how much he cared for Windekind．Yes，he would forsake and forget everybody and everything for his sake：his little room，and Presto，and his father．He repeated his wish，full of joy and determination．

The rain had ceased．A bright smile of sunshine gleamed through the grey clouds on the wet sparkling leaves，on the drops which hung twinkling from every twig and blade of grass，and gemmed the spiders' webs spread among the oak leaves．A filmy mist rose slowly from the moist earth and hung over the underwood， bringing up a thousand warm，sleepy odours．The blackbird flew to the topmost bough and sang a short，passionate melody to the sinking sun—as though he would show what kind of singing befitted the spot—in the solemn evening stillness，to the soft accompaniment of falling drops．

“Is that not more lovely than the noises of men，Johannes？ Ah，the blackbird knows exactly the right thing to sing！Here all is harmony；you will find none so perfect among men．”

“What is harmony，Windekind？”

“It is the same thing as happiness．It is that which all agree in striving after．Men too，but they do so like children trying to catch a butterfly．Their stupid efforts are just what scare it away．”

“And shall I find it with you？”

“Yes，Johannes．But you must forget men and women．It is a bad beginning to have been born to be a man；but you are still young．You must put away from you all remembrance of your human life；among them you would go astray，and fall into mischief and strife and wretchedness—it would be with you as it was with the young cockchafer of whom I told you．”

“What happened to him afterwards？”

“He saw the beautiful light of which the old chafer spoke；he thought he could do no better than fly towards it at once．He flew straight into a room，and into a human hand．For three days he lived in torture；he was shut up in a cardboard box；they tied a thread to his feet and let him fly at the end of it；then they untied him，with one wing and one leg torn off；and at last，helplessly creeping round and round on a carpet，trying to feel his way back to the garden，a heavy foot crushed him to death．All the creatures，Johannes，which come out and about at night are just as much children of the Sun as we are．And although they have never seen their glorious father， still an obscure remembrance always tempts them wherever a light is beaming．And thousands of poor creatures of the darkness find a miserable end through their love for the Sun，from which they were so long since parted，and to which they have become strangers．And in the same way a vague and irresistible attraction brings men to ruin in the false image of that Great Light whence they proceeded，but which they no longer know．”

Johannes looked inquiringly into Windekind's eyes，but they were as deep and mysterious as the dark sky between the stars．

“Do you mean God？”he timidly asked．

“God？”There was a soft smile in the deep eyes．“I know， Johannes，what you are thinking of when you speak that word，—of the chair by your bed-side where you knelt to say your long prayers last evening—of the green serge curtains in front of the church window，which you gaze at by the hour on Sunday mornings—of the capital letters in your little Bible—of the church-bag with its long pole—of the stupid singing and the stuffy atmosphere．All that you mean by the word，Johannes，is a monstrous，false image．In place of the sun a huge petroleum lamp，to which thousands and thousands of flies are helplessly and hopelessly stuck fast！”

“But what then is the name of that Great Light，Windekind？ And to whom must I pray？”

“Johannes，it is as though a patch of mould should ask me what was the name of the earth which bears it round in space．Even if there were any answer to your question you would no more understand it than an earthworm can hear the music of the stars．Still，I will teach you to pray．”

And while Johannes was still silently wondering over Windekind's reply，the elf flew out of the wood with him，high up，so high that beyond the edge of the down a long narrow line was visible，gleaming like gold．They flew on and on，the undulating sand-hills beneath them gliding away，and the streak of light growing broader and broader．The green hue faded，the wild broom was grey and thin，and strange bluish-green plants grew among the bushes．Then another range of hills—a long narrow strip of sand—and beyond，the wide unresting sea．The vast expanse was blue to the very horizon；but out there，under the sun，a small streak shone in blinding red fire．

An endless fringe of downy-looking white foam edged the waters，as ermine borders blue velvet．

On the horizon a wonderful，fine line divided the air from the ocean．It was indeed a marvel；straight yet curved；sharply defined yet non-existent；visible yet intangible．It was like the vibration of a harp-string，which thrills dreamily for a long time，seeming to die away and yet still be there．

Then little Johannes sat down on the sand-hill and gazed—gazed long—motionless and silent；till he felt as though he were about to die，—as though the great golden gates of the Infinite had opened majestically before him，and his little soul were soaring forth towards the first light of eternity．

Until the tears，which welled up to his wide-open eyes，had dimmed the radiance of the sun，and the splendour of sky and earth floated off into soft tremulous light．

“That is the way to pray！”said Windekind．





V


Have you ever loitered in the woods on a fresh autumn day？ When the sun shines calmly and clearly on the richly-tinted foliage；when the boughs creak，and the dry leaves rustle under foot．

The forest seems weary of life；it can merely think，and lives in its memories of the past．A blue mist hangs about it like a dream，full of mysterious splendour，and the glistening gossamers float on the air with slow undulations—a sweet aimless musing．

And now from the moist ground among the mosses and withered leaves suddenly and inexplicably the strange forms of toadstools spring into being．Some sturdy，deformed and fleshy；others slim and tall with ringed stems and gaily painted hats．These are the quaint dream-figures of the forest．

On the decayed tree-trunks，too，there are little white columns in numerable，with black heads as though they had been burnt．Certain learned men regard them as a sort of fungus．But Johannes knew better：—

They are little tapers．In the still autumn nights they burn while the boguey-sprites sit near them，reading their little books．

Windekind had told him this one such tranquil autumn day，and Johannes dreamily drank in the faint earthy smell which came up from the mouldering ground．

“How is it that the leaves of the ash-trees are so speckled with black？”

“Ah！the boguey-sprites do that too，”said Windekind．“When they have been busy writing at night，in the morning they throw out what is left in their ink-bottles over the leaves．They do not love the ash-trees；crosses are made of ash-wood，and poles for church bags．”

Johannes was curious to know all about the busy little sprites， and he made Windekind promise to take him to see one of them．

He had now stayed some time with Windekind，and he was so happy in his new life that he felt very little regret for his promise to forget all he had left behind him．And he had no hours of loneliness or terror，when repentance is always apt to intrude．Windekind never quitted him，and with him he felt everywhere at home．He slept soundly in the swinging nest，where it hung between the green reeds， however ominously the bittern might boom or the raven croak．He knew no fear of the pelting rain or howling storm—he could creep into a hollow tree or a rabbit's burrow，and hide close under Windekind's cloak，and listen to his voice as he told him tales．

And now he was to see the Wood-Sprites．

It was a good day for such a visit．So calm，so still，Johannes fancied he could already hear tiny voices and the rustle of little feet，though it was mid-day．The birds had almost all fled；only the thrushes were feasting on the scarlet berries．One was caught in a snare．There he hung with flapping wings，struggling till his sharp clenched claws were almost torn away．Johannes made haste to set him free，and he flew off with a happy chirp．

The toadstools had a great deal to say．

“Only look at me！”said a fat puffy Toadstool．“Did you ever see the like？ See how thick and white my stem is，and how my hat shines．I am the biggest of you all．And that in one night！”

“Pooh！”said the red spotted toadstool．“You are most vulgar！—so brown and clumsy．Now，I sway on a tall stem like a reed；I am of a splendid red like the rowan berries，and most elegantly speckled．I am the handsomest of you all．”

“Hush！”said Johannes，who knew them both of old．“You are both poisonous．”

“That is a virtue，”said the red fellow．

“Or are you a man by chance？”retorted the fat toadstool．“Then indeed I wish you would eat me．”

But Johannes did not eat him；he took some dry twigs and stuck them into his round hat．That looked funny，and all the others laughed；even a swarm of slender toadstools with little brown heads who had only come up a few hours since，and pushed themselves everywhere to look out on the world．The fat toadstool turned blue with spite，thus displaying his venomous nature．

Earth-stars raised their little pert heads on angular stems．Now and then a little cloud of the finest brown powder puffed out of the opening in a round head．Wherever that dust fell on the moist soil，threads would tangle and plait beneath the dark earth，and next year myriads of fresh stars would come up．

“What a beautiful existence！”they said to each other．“The happiest lot in life is to shed dust．What joy to think we may do it as long as we live！”

And they puffed the little smoke-like cloud into the air with the deepest concentration．

“Are they really happy，Windekind？”

“Why not？ What higher joy can they know？ They are happy，for they ask no better because they know no better．”

When night fell，and the shadows of the trees were merged in uniform gloom，the mysterious vitality of the forest knew no rest．The branches snapped and cracked，the dry leaves rustled hither and thither among the grass and in the underwood．Then Johannes felt the touch of invisible wings and was aware of the presence of invisible beings．He could plainly hear the murmur of little voices and tripping of little feet．There！there in the darkest depth of the thicket，a tiny blue spark glowed and vanished．There was another and another！—Hark！When he listened attentively he could hear a rustling in the leaf-strewn floor near him，close to the black tree-trunk．The blue lights again were visible and then stood still on the top．

Now Johannes saw such lights all about him；they flitted among the brown leaves，dancing along with airy leaping；and in one place a large sparkling mass beamed like a blue bonfire．

“What fire is that？”asked Johannes．“It burns splendidly．”

“That is a rotten tree-stump，”replied Windekind．

They went towards a bright light which remained steady．

“Now I will introduce you to Wistik．He is the oldest and wisest of the Wood-Sprites．

As they approached Johannes saw him sitting by his candle．The wrinkled little face with its grey beard could be plainly seen by the blue light；he was reading diligently with knitted brows．On his head he wore an acorn-cup with a tiny feather in it．Before him sat a wood-spider listening to his reading．

When the pair went near him，the little boguey，without raising his head，looked up from his book and lifted his eyebrows．The spider crept away．

“Good-evening，”said he．“I am Wistik．Who are you？”

“My name is Johannes．I should like to make acquaintance with you．What are you reading？”

“It is not meant for your ears，”said Wistik．“It is only for wood-spiders．”

“Just let me once look at it，dear Wistik，”begged Johannes．

“I cannot．This is the sacred book of the spiders，and is in my charge．I may not let it out of my own hands．I have the keeping of the sacred books of the snails，and the butterflies，and the hedge-hogs，and the moles，and all the creatures that live here．They cannot all read，and when they want to know anything I read it to them．This is a great honour for me，a post of trust，you understand．”

The sprite nodded very gravely several times，and pointed with his tiny forefinger．

“And what were you studying just now？”

“The history of Kribbelgauw，the great hero among spiders， who lived very long ago and had a net which spread over three trees， and in which he caught millions of flies every day．Before the time of Kribbelgauw spiders made no nets，but lived on grass and dead creatures；but Kribbelgauw was a very clever fellow，and proved that all living insects were created on purpose for food for spiders．Then，by the most laborious calculation，Kribbelgauw discovered the art of making nets，for he was very learned．And to this day the wood-spiders make their nets exactly as he taught them，thread for thread，only much smaller．For the spider race is greatly degenerate．Kribbelgauw caught great birds in his net，and murdered thousands of his own children—he was something like a spider！At last there came a great storm and carried away Kribbelgauw and his net，with the three trees it was made fast to，through the air to a distant wood， where he is now perpetually honoured for his great achievements and sagacity．”

“Is that all true？”asked Johannes．

“It is all in this book，”said Wistik．

“Do you believe it？”

The boguey shut one eye and laid his forefinger to his nose．

“The sacred books of other creatures，when they mention Kribbelgauw，speak of him as a hateful and contemptible monster．But that is no concern of mine．”

“And is there a Sprites' Book，Wistik？”

Wistik looked at Johannes rather suspiciously．

“What sort of creature are you really，Johannes？ There is something—just something—human about you，so to speak．”

“No，no；be easy，Wistik，”said Windekind，“we are elves．But formerly Johannes saw a good deal of men and their doings．You may trust him entirely．It can do him no harm．”

“Ay，ay，well and good．But I am called the wisest of the sprites—and I studied long and hard before I knew what I know．So now I must be cautious with my learning．If I tell you too much，I shall lose my reputation．”

“But in what book do you think that the truth is to be found？”

“I have read a great deal，but I do not believe that I have ever read that book．It is not the Elves' Book nor the Sprites'．Yet it must exist．”

“The Men's Book perhaps？”

“That I do not know，but I do not think it．For the True Book must bring with it great peace and great happiness．In it there must be an exact explanation of why everything is as it is，so that no one need ever ask or inquire any more．Now men，I believe，have not got so far as that．”

“Oh dear，no！”said Windekind，laughing．

“Is there anywhere such a book？”said Johannes eagerly．

“Yes，yes，”whispered the sprite．“I know there is，from very ancient legends．And—hush！—I know where it is，and who can find it．”

“Oh，Wistik！Wistik！”

“Why then have you not yet got it？”asked Windekind．

“Patience，patience，—it will be found．I know as yet no particulars，—but I shall soon find it．I have toiled for it and sought it all my life．For to him who finds it life shall be one perpetual autumn day—blue air above and blue mists all round，—only no falling leaves shall rustle，no twigs shall snap，no raindrops patter， the shadows shall not change，the sun-gold on the tree-tops shall not fade．What seems to us now to be light shall be darkness；what seems to us now to be joy shall be woe by comparison，to those who read that book！Ay！I know this much，and some day I shall find it．”

The Wood-Sprite raised his eyebrows very much and laid his finger on his lips．

“Wistik，if you could but teach me—”Johannes began；but before he could say more he felt a strong gust of wind and saw a great，broad black shroud overhead，which silently and swiftly swept by．

When he looked for Wistik again he saw one little foot just vanishing into the hollow tree．Whisk！the sprite had leapt into his cave，book and all．The candles burnt paler and paler and suddenly went out．Those were very strange little candles．

“What was that？”asked Johannes，clinging in terror to Winde-kind in the darkness．

“An owl，”said Windekind．

Then they were both silent for some time．Presently Johannes said：—“Do you believe what Wistik said？”

“Wistik is not so wise as he thinks himself．He will never find such a book，nor you either．”

“But does it exist？”

“It exists，as your shadow exists，Johannes．However fast you run，however cautiously you seize it，you can never overtake it or hold it．And at last you discover that you are trying to catch yourself．Do not be foolish；forget the sprite's chatter．I can tell you a hundred finer tales．Come along！We will go to the outskirts of the wood and see how our good father draws off the white woollen coverlets of dew from the sleeping meadows．Come．”

Johannes went；but he did not understand Windekind's words， nor did he follow his counsel．And while he watched the dawn of the glorious autumn morning，he was meditating over the book in which it is written why everything is as it is，and repeating to himself in a low tone，“Wistik！”





VI


It seemed to him，all the next few days，as though it was no longer so delightful or so beautiful to be with Windekind in the wood or on the sand-hills．His thoughts were no onger wholly occupied with all that Windekind told him or showed him．He could not help thinking of that Book，but he dared not speak of it．The things he saw seemed to him less fine and wonderful than before．The clouds were so black and heavy，he was afraid lest they should fall upon him．It distressed him when the unresting autumn wind shook and bowed the poor weary trees，so that the sallow under side of the leaves was seen，and yellow leaves and dry twigs were swept before the gale．

What Windekind told him had ceased to interest him．A great deal of it he did not understand，and he never got a perfectly clear and satisfactory answer when he asked one of his old questions．And this again made him think of that Book in which everything was set forth so plainly and simply；and of that everlasting still and sunny autumn day which would ensue．

“Wistik！Wistik！”he murmured．

Windekind heard him．

“Johannes，I am afraid you ought to have remained a human being．Even your friendship is as that of men—the first person who has spoken to you after me has won all your confidence from me．Ah！my mother was right after all！”

“No，Windekind．But you are much wiser than Wistik—as wise as that Book．Why do you not tell me everything？ See now！Why does the wind blow through the trees so that they bend and bow？ Look，they can bear it no longer；the boughs snap and the leaves are flying by hundreds on all sides，though they are still green and fresh．They are so tired they can no longer hold on，and yet they are constantly shaken and thrashed by the rude，spiteful wind．Why is it so？ What does the wind mean？”

“My poor Johannes，you are talking as men talk．”

“Make it stop，Windekind．I want calm and sunshine．”

“You question and want as a man；there is no answer，no fulfilment．If you cannot learn to ask or wish better，the autumn day will never dawn for you，and you will be like the thousands of human beings who have talked to Wistik．”

“What，so many？”

“Yes，thousands．Wistik affects great mystery，but he is a chatterbox who cannot keep his own secrets．He hoped to find the Book among men，and communicates his knowledge to every one who might be able to help him．And he has made many as unhappy as himself．They believe in him，and go forth to seek the Book with as much zeal as some use in seeking the art of making gold．They sacrifice everything，give up their calling and their happiness， and shut themselves up among big volumes or strange matters and instruments．They risk their lives and health，they forget the blue sky and kindly gentle Nature—nay，even their fellow-creatures．Some find good and useful things，as it were gold nuggets，which they throw out of their holes on to the bright sunlit surface of the earth；but they do not themselves care for these；they leave them for others to enjoy，while they dig and grub on in the dark without cessation or rest．They are not seeking gold but the Book．Some lose their wits over the work，forgetting their object and aim，and becoming mere miserable dotards．The sprite has made them quite childish．You may see them building up little castles of sand，and calculating how many grains more are needed to make them fall in；they make little watercourses，and estimate precisely the bends and bays the water will make；they dig trenches，and devote all their patience and reason to making them very smooth and free from stones．If these poor idiots are interrupted in their work and asked what they are doing，they look up with great importance，shake their heads and mutter，“Wistik，Wistik！”

“Yes，it is all the fault of that little foolish Wood-Sprite．Have nothing to say to him，Johannes．”

But Johannes stared before him at the swaying，creaking trees．The smooth brow above his clear childish eyes puckered into furrows．He had never before looked so grave．

“And yet—you yourself said—that there is such a Book！And oh！I am quite sure that in it there is all about the Great Light，whose name you will not tell me．”

“Poor，poor little Johannes！”said Windekind，and his voice rose above the dizzy clamour of the storm like a peaceful hymn，sounding very far away．“Love me，only love me with all your might．In me， you will find even more than you wish．You shall understand that which you cannot conceive of，and be，yourself，what you desire to know．Earth and heaven shall be familiar to you，the stars shall be your neighbours，infinitude shall be your dwelling-place．”

“Love me！only love me！Cling to me as the hop-bine to the tree，be true to me as the lake is to its bed—in me alone shall you find rest，Johannes．”

Windekind ceased speaking，but the choral psalm still went on．It seemed to float at an immense distance，in solemn rhythm，through the raging and sighing of the wind—as tranquil as the moonlight shining between the driving clouds．

Windekind opened his arms and Johannes fell asleep on his breast，under the shelter of the blue cloak．

But in the night he awoke．Peace had suddenly and imperceptibly fallen on the world；the moon was below the horizon；the leaves hung limp and motionless；the forest was full of silence and darkness．

And questions came back on Johannes's mind，in swift spectral succession，dislodging all his newly-born confidence．Why were men thus made？ Why must he come away from them and lose their love？ Why must the winter come？ Why must the leaves fall and the flowers die？ Why—why？

Down in the thicket the blue lights were dancing again．They came and went．Johannes gazed at them with eager attention．He saw the larger，brighter light shining on the dark tree-trunk．Windekind was sleeping soundly and peacefully．

“Just one more question！”thought Johannes，creeping out from under the blue mantle．

“So，here you are again！”cried Wistik，with a friendly nod，“I am very pleased to see you．And where is your friend？”

“Out yonder．But I wanted to ask you one more question—alone．Will you answer it？”

“You have lived among men，I am sure．Has it anything to do with my secret？”

“Who will find the Book，Wistik？”

“Ay，ay！That's it，that's it．If I tell you，will you help me？”

“If I can—certainly．”

“Then listen，Johannes．”Wistik opened his eyes astonishingly wide，and raised his eyebrows higher than ever．Then he whispered behind his little hand．“Men have the golden casket；elves have the golden key；the foe of the elves can never find it，the friend of men alone can open it．The first night of Spring is the right time，and Robin Redbreast knows the way．”

“Is that true，quite true？”cried Johannes，remembering his little key．

“Yes，”said Wistik．

“How is it that no one has found it yet？”asked Johannes，“so many men are seeking for it．”

“I have never confided to any man，never to any man，what I have told you．I never before knew a friend of the Elves．”

“I have it，Wistik，I can help you！”Johannes leaped and clapped his hands．“I will ask Windekind about it．”

Away he flew over the moss and dry leaves．But he stumbled now and then and his feet were heavy．Stout twigs snapped under his tread，while before，it had not even bent the blades of grass．

There was the shady fern under which they had been sleeping．Their bed was empty．

“Windekind！”he called．But he started at the sound of his own voice．

“Windekind！”It sounded like a human voice．A scared night-bird flew up with a shriek．

There was no one under the fern．Johannes could see no one．The blue lights had vanished．It was very cold and perfectly dark on all sides．Overhead，he saw the black tree-tops against the starry sky．

Once more he called．Then he dared no more；his voice was an insult to the silence，and Windekind's name a mockery．

Poor Johannes fell on the ground and sobbed in helpless grief．





VII


The morning was cold and grey．The black shining boughs， swept bare by the storm，dripped in the fog．Little Johannes ran as fast as he could over the wet，down-beaten grass，looking before him in the distance where the wood was thinnest，as though he had some goal beyond．His eyes were red with crying，and dazed with fear and grief．He had been wandering about all night，seeking some light，—the feeling of being safe and at home had vanished with Windekind．The spirit of loneliness lurked in every dark corner；he dared not look round．

At last he came out of the wood；he looked over a meadowland， and fine close rain was pouring steadily．A horse was standing out in the rain close to a bare willow tree．It stood motionless，with bowed head，and the water trickled slowly off its shining flanks and plaited mane．

Johannes ran on，along the skirt of the wood．He looked with dim，timid eyes at the lonely beast，and the grey drizzle，and he softly groaned．

“Now it is all over，”thought he．“Now the sun will never come again．Now everything will always look the same to me as it does here．”

But he dared not stand still in his despair；something most dreadful would befall him，he thought．

Then he espied the high wall of a garden，and a little house， under a lime-tree with faded yellow leaves．He went into the enclosure and ran along broad paths where the brown and gold lime-leaves thickly covered the ground．Purple asters and other gay autumn flowers grew by the grass plots in wild abundance．

Then he came to a pond．By the side of it was a large house， with windows and doors all opening down to the ground．Climbing roses and other creepers grew against the walls．But it was all shut up and deserted．Half-stripped chestnut trees stood about the house， and on the earth，among the fallen leaves Johannes saw the shining brown chestnuts．

The cold，dead feeling about his heart disappeared．He thought of his own home—there two chestnut-trees grew，and at this season he always went out to pick up chestnuts．He suddenly longed to be there，as though an inviting voice had called him．He sat down on a bench close to the big house and cried himself to rest．

A peculiar smell made him look up．A man was standing by him，with a white apron on and a pipe in his mouth．Round his waist he had a wisp of bast with which he tied up the flowers．Johannes knew that smell so well！It reminded him of his own garden，and the gardener who brought him pretty caterpillars and showed him starling's eggs．

He was not frightened，—though it was a man who stood before him．He told the man that he had got lost and did not know his way， and thankfully followed him to the little cottage under the lime-tree．

Indoors，the gardener's wife sat knitting black stockings．A large kettle of water was hung to boil over the turf-fire in the hearth-place．On the mat by the fire lay a cat with her forepaws crossed，just as Simon had been lying when Johannes left home．

Johannes was made to sit down by the fire to dry his feet．“Tick-tick，tick-tick，”said the great hanging clock．Johannes looked at the steam which came singing out of the kettle，and at the little flames which skipped and jumped fantastically about the peat blocks．

“Here I am among men，”thought he．

It was not alarming．He felt easy and safe．They were kind and friendly，and asked him what he would like to do．

“I would rather stay here，”he replied．

Here he was at peace，and if he went home there would be scolding and tears．He would have to listen in silence，and he would be told that he had been very naughty．He would be obliged to look back on the past，and think everything over once more．

He longed，to be sure，for his little room，for his father，for Presto—but he could better endure the quiet longing for them here than the painful，miserable meeting．And he felt as though here he could still think of Windekind，while at home he could not．

Windekind was now certainly quite gone．Gone far away to the sunny land where palm-trees bend over the blue sea．He would do penance here and await his friend's return．

So he begged the two good folks to let him live with them．He would be obedient and work for them．He would help to take care of the garden and the flowers，at any rate through this winter；for he hoped in his heart that Windekind would return with the Spring．

The gardener and his wife supposed that Johannes had run away from home because he had been hardly treated．They pitied him，and promised to let him stay．

So he remained and helped to work in the garden and attend to the flowers．They gave him a little room to sleep in with a bedstead painted blue．Out of it，in the morning，he could see the wet yellow lime-leaves flutter past the window，and at night the black boughs waving to and fro，and the stars playing hide-and-seek between them．And he gave names to the stars，and the brightest of them he called Windekind．

He told his history only to the flowers，most of which he had known before at home；to the large，solemn asters，the many-hued zinnias，and the white chrysanthemums which bloom on so late into the blustering autumn．When all the rest of the flowers were dead the chrysanthemums still stood upright—even when one morning the first snow had fallen and Johannes came to see how they were getting on，they held up their cheerful faces and said：“Yes，we are still here．You would never have thought it！”And they looked very brave；but two days later they were all dead．

But palms and tree-ferns were still thriving in the hot-house，and the strange blossoms of orchids hung in the damp heat．Johannes peeped with amazement into their gorgeous cups，and thought of Windekind．How cold and colourless everything seemed then when he came out again—the sloppy snow with black footmarks，and the sighing，dripping branches of the trees！

But when the snow-flakes had been noiselessly falling hour after hour so that the boughs bent under the growing burthen， Johannes ran off gleefully into the purple twilight of the snow-laden wood．That was silence—but not death．It was almost more lovely than summer verdure，as the dazzling whiteness of the tangled twigs made lace-work against the light-blue sky，or as one of the over-weighted boughs shook off its load of snow，which fell in a cloud of glittering powder．

Once in the course of such a walk，when he had gone so far that all round him there was nothing to be seen but snow and snow-wrapped woods，half white and half black，and every sound of life seemed stifled under the glistening downy shroud，it happened that he thought he saw a tiny white creature running swiftly in front of him．He followed it—it resembled no animal that he knew；but when he tried to catch it，it promptly vanished into a hollow trunk．Johannes stared into the hole where it had disappeared and thought to himself：“I wonder if it was Wistik？”

But he did not think much about him．He fancied it was wrong， and he would not spoil his fit of repentance．And his life with these two kind people left him little to ask for．In the evenings he had indeed to read aloud out of a thick book in which a great deal was said about God；but he was familiar with the book，and read unheeding．That night，however，after his walk in the snow，he lay awake in his bed，looking at the cold gleam of the moonlight on the floor．All at once he saw two tiny hands which came out from below the bedstead and firmly clutched the edge．Then the top of a little white fur cap came into sight between the two hands，and at last he saw a pair of grave eyes under uplifted eyebrows．

“Good-evening，Johannes！”said Wistik．“I am come to remind you of your promise．You cannot yet have found the Book，for it is not yet Spring time．But do you ever think it over？ What is that thick book which you are made to read？ But that cannot be the right book．Do not imagine that．”

“I do not imagine that，Wistik，”said Johannes．He turned over to go to sleep again；but he could not get the gold key out of his head．Before now，when reading the big Book，he had thought of that，and he saw plainly that it could not be the right Book．





VIII


“Now he will come back，”thought Johannes，the first time the snow had melted here and there，and the snowdrops peeped out in bunches．“Will he come now？”he asked of the snowdrops．But they did not know，and stood there with hanging heads，looking down at the earth as if they were ashamed of their haste to come out，and would gladly creep back again．

If only they could have done so！The numbing east wind soon began to blow again，and the snow drifted deep over the foolish， forward little things．

Some weeks later came the violets；their sweet smell betrayed them among the brushwood；and when the sun had shone warmly on the mossy ground the pale primroses came out by hundreds and thousands．

The shy violets with their fine fragrance were the mysterious harbingers of coming splendour，but the glad primroses were the glorious reality．The waking earth had caught and captured the first sunbeams and turned them into a golden jewel．

“Now—now he will certainly come！”thought Johannes．He eagerly watched the leaf-buds on the trees as they slowly swelled day by day and freed themselves from the bark，till the first pale-green tips peeped out between the brown scales．Johannes would stand gazing for long at the little young leaves—he could never see them move，but if he only turned round，they seemed to have grown bigger．“They dare not，so long as I am looking at them，”thought he．

The shade had already begun to be green．Still Windekind did not come，no dove had settled near him，no little mouse had spoken to him．When he spoke to the flowers they merely nodded and never answered．“My punishment is not yet ended，”thought he．

One sunny spring morning he went to the pond by the great house．The windows were all wide open．Had the people who lived there come back？

The bird-cherry which grew by the water-side was entirely covered with fresh leaves；every twig had a crop of delicate green winglets．On the grass by the tree lay a young girl；Johannes could only see that she had a light-blue dress and fair hair．A robin，sitting on her shoulder，fed out of her hand．She suddenly turned her head and looked at Johannes．

“Good-day，little man！”said she，with a friendly nod．

Johannes felt a glow from head to foot．Those were Windekind's eyes；that was Windekind's voice．

“Who are you？”he asked．His lips trembled with excitement．

“I am Robinetta，and this is my bird．He will not be afraid of you．Are you fond of birds？”

The Redbreast was not afraid of Johannes；it flew on to his arm．This was just as it used to be．The being in blue must be Windekind．

“And tell me what your name is，boy，”said Windekind's voice．

“Do you not know me？ Do you not know that my name is Johannes？”

“How should I know that？”

What did this mean？ For it was the sweet familiar voice，and those were the same dark，heavenly-deep blue eyes．

“Why do you look at me so，Johannes？ Have you ever seen me before？”

“Yes I have，indeed．”

“You must surely have dreamed it．”

“Dreamed it？”thought Johannes．“Can I have dreamed it？ Or can I be dreaming now？”

“Where were you born？”he inquired．

“A long way from hence，in a great town．”

“Among human beings？”

Robinetta laughed—it was Windekind's laugh．“Why，I should think so．Were not you？”

“Oh yes，I was too．”

“Do you object to that？ Do you not like human beings？”

“No．Who could？”

“Who？—Well，Johannes，you are a very strange little boy．Do you like beasts better？”

“Oh，much better，—and flowers．”

“So do I myself sometimes；just for once in a while．But it is not right．We ought to love our fellow-men，my father says．”

“Why is it not right？ I love whom I choose，whether it is right or not．”

“Fie，Johannes！Have you no parents or any one to take care of you？ And do you not love them？”

“Yes，”said Johannes thoughtfully，“I love my father．But not because it is right—nor yet because he is a man．”

“Why then？”

“That I do not know，—because he is not like other men；because he too is fond of birds and flowers．”

“And so am I，Johannes，as you may see．”And Robinetta called the robin to sit on her hand and talked to him fondly．

“That I know，”replied Johannes，“and I love you very much．”

“Already？ That is quick work！”laughed the girl．“And whom， then，do you love best？”

Johannes hesitated．Should he utter Windekind's name？ The fear that he might accidentally speak it in the presence of other persons was never out of his thoughts．And yet，was not this fair-haired creature in blue Windekind in person？ How else could she give him such a sense of rest and gladness？

“You，”he suddenly replied，looking full into those deep blue eyes．He boldly made a complete surrender；but he was a little alarmed nevertheless，and anxiously awaited her reception of his precious offering．

Robinetta laughed again，a light clear laugh；but she took his hand and her look was no colder nor her voice less full of feeling．

“Why，Johannes，”said she，“what have I done to deserve it all at once？”

Johannes made no reply，but stood looking at her with trustful eyes．Robinetta rose and laid her arm on his shoulder．She was taller than he．Thus they wandered on through the wood，gathering great bunches of cowslips till they could have hidden under the mass of bright yellow blossoms．The robin flew，as they went on，from branch to branch，and watched them with his glittering little black eyes．

They did not talk much，but looked at each other now and then， with a side glance．They were both embarrassed by this meeting and did not know what to think of each other．But Robinetta had soon to turn back．It was growing late．

“I must go now，Johannes．But will you come and walk with me again？ I think you are a nice little boy，”she said as they turned round．

“Weet，weet！”piped the robin，and flew after her．

When she was away and he had only her image left to think of， he had not a moment's doubt as to who she was．She it was to whom he had given his friendship：the name of Windekind faded from his mind，and that of Robinetta took its place．

And now everything was the same to him again as it had formerly been．The flowers nodded gaily，and their scent drove away the melancholy home-sickness which he had felt and encouraged now and then．Amid the tender greenery，in the warm，soft breeze of spring，he all at once felt himself at home，like a bird that has found its nest．He spread out his arms and drew a deep breath；he was so happy．As he went homewards the figure in light blue with yellow hair，floated before him whichever way he turned his gaze．It was as though he had looked on the sun，and its image danced before his eyes where-ever he looked．

From that day forward Johannes found his way to the pond every fine morning．He went early，as soon as he was roused by the squabbling of the sparrows in the ivy round his window，and by the twitter and wheeze of the starlings as they fluttered on the roof and wheeled in the early sunshine．Then he flew off through the dewy grass，to wait close by the house，behind a lilac-bush，till he heard the glass door open and saw the light figure come out．

Away they went，wandering through the wood and over the sand-hills which skirted it．They talked of all they saw，the trees，and the plants and the downs．Johannes had a strange bewildered feeling as he walked by her side；sometimes he felt so light that he fancied he could fly through the air．But that never happened．He told her all the stories of the flowers and animals that he had heard from Windekind．But he had forgotten who had told them to him，and Windekind did not now stand before him，only Robinetta．He was happy when she smiled at him and he saw her friendship for him in her eyes；and he would talk to her as of old he had talked to his little dog，telling her everything that came into his head，without reserve or timidity．During the hours when he could not see her he thought of her；and in everything he did he asked himself whether Robinetta would think it right or nice．

She herself seemed no less pleased to see him；she smiled and ran quicker to meet him．She told him indeed that there was no one she was so glad to walk with as with him．

“But，Johannes，”said she one day，“how do you know all these things？ How do you know what the cockchafers think about，what the thrushes sing，what the inside of the rabbit-holes is like，and how things look at the bottom of the water？”

“I have been told，”answered Johannes，“and I have myself been inside a rabbit-burrow，and down to the bottom of the water．”

Robinetta knit her pretty eyebrows and looked at him half mockingly．But he looked as if he were speaking the truth．

They were sitting under lilac-trees covered with large bunches of purple blossoms．In front of them was the pond with its reeds and duck-weed．They saw the black water-snails gliding below the surface，and red spiders busily swinging up and down．It was swarming with life and movement．Johannes，lost in remembrance， gazed down into the depths and said—

“I went down there once．I slipped down a reed to the very bottom．It is covered all over with dead leaves which fall so lightly and softly．It is always twilight there—green twilight，because the light comes through the green duck-weed．And over my head I saw the long white rootlets of the duck-weed hanging down．Newts came and swam round me；they are very inquisitive．It is strange to see such great creatures swimming overhead；and I could not see far before me，it was too dark，and all green．In that darkness， the creatures appeared like black shades．Water-snails with their swimming-foot and flat shells，and sometimes a little fish．I went a long way，for hours，I believe，and in the middle was a great forest of water-plants，where snails were creeping and water-spiders wove their glistening nets．Sticklebacks shot in and out，and sometimes paused to stare at me，with open mouth and quivering fins—they were so much astonished．I made friends there with an eel，whose tail I unfortunately trod on．He told me the history of his travels；he had been as far as the sea，he said．For this，he had been chosen king of the pool，for no one else had ever been so far．He always lay sleeping in the mud，except when he got something to eat which the others brought him．He ate a terrible quantity．That was because he was king；they like to have a very fat king；it looks grand．Oh！it was lovely down in that pool．”

“They why do you not go down there again now？”

“Now？”repeated Johannes，looking at her with wide，bewildered eyes．“Now？ I can never go again now．I should be drowned．But I do not care．I had rather stay here，by the lilac-bush，with you．”

Robinetta shook her yellow head，much puzzled，and stroked Johannes's hair．Then she looked at her bird，which seemed to be finding all sorts of delicious morsels by the edge of the pond．It glanced up at that moment，and watched the pair for a moment with its bright little eyes．

“Do you understand anything of all this，Dicky-bird？”

The Robin looked very knowing and went on hunting and pecking．

“Tell me something more，Johannes，of the things you have seen．”

This Johannes was very glad to do，and Robinetta listened with attentive belief in all he said．

“But where did this all happen？ Why cannot you go now with me？ Everywhere—all about？ I should like it so much．”

Johannes did his best to remember，but a sunlit mist covered the dim landscape where he had once wandered．He could not quite make out how it was that his former happiness had deserted him．

“I do not know exactly—you must not ask about that．A foolish little being spoiled it all．But it is all right now—better even than before．”

The scent of the lilac poured down on them from the bushes， and the humming of the insects on the pool，and the peaceful sunshine filled them with pleasant drowsiness，till a bell rang at the great house with a swinging clang，and Robinetta flew off．

When Johannes went into his little room that evening，as he looked at the moon-shadows of the ivy leaves which stole across the brick floor，he fancied he heard a tap at the window．He thought it was an ivy leaf shaken by the wind．But it was such a distinct knocking，three taps each time，that Johannes softly opened the window and cautiously peeped out．The ivy against the wall glistened in the blue gleam—the dark world below was full of mystery；there were hollows and caves，where the moon lighted up small blue sparks，which made the darkness behind seem deeper still．

After staring for a long time into the marvels of the shadow-world，Johannes discerned the form of a tiny mannikin，close to the window，screened by a large ivy leaf．He at once recognised Wistik by his large wondering eyes and uplifted eyebrows．The moon had set a spark of light on the tip of Wistik's long nose．

“Have you forgotten me，Johannes？ Why do you never think of me？ It is the right time of year．Have you asked Robin Redbreast to show you the way？”

“Oh，Wistik，why should I ask？ I have all I can wish for．I have Robinetta．”

“But that cannot last long．And you might be happier still—and certainly Robinetta might．And is the little key to lie there？ Only think how splendid it would be if you two were to find the Book！ Ask Robin Redbreast about it，and I will help as far as I can．”

“I can ask about it at any rate，”said Johannes．Wistik nodded， and nimbly scrambled down to the ground；and Johannes looked at the deep shadows and the shining ivy leaves for a long time before he went to bed．Next day he asked the Redbreast whether he knew the way to the golden chest．Robinetta listened in surprise．Johannes saw the Robin nod his head and give a side-glance at Robinetta．

“Not here！not here！”piped the little bird．

“What are you asking，Johannes？”said Robinetta．

“Do you know anything about it，Robinetta？ Do you know where it is to be found？ Are you not waiting for the little golden key？”

“No，no．Tell me，what is it？”

Johannes told her all he knew about the Book．

“And I have the key，and I thought that you must have the little golden chest．Is it not so，Dicky-bird？”

But the bird pretended not to hear，and flew about among the young pale-green birch boughs．

They were sitting under a sand-hill，on which little birches and broom shrubs grew．A grassy path ran up the slope，and they sat at the edge of it，on the thick，dark，green moss．They could see over the tops of the low shrubs，a green sea of leaves with waves in light and shade．

“I believe，”said Robinetta，after thinking for some time，“that I can find what you want before you do．But what do you mean about the little key？ How did you come by it？”

“Ah！—how did I？—How was that？”muttered Johannes to himself，staring across the green landscape into the distance．

Suddenly，as though they had come into being under the sunny blue sky，a pair of white butterflies met his sight．They flitted and wheeled，and shone in the sunshine with purposeless giddy flutterings；but they came close to him．

“Windekind！Windekind！”The name came back to Johannes， and he spoke it in a whisper．

“What is Windekind？”asked Robinetta．

The Redbreast flew chirping up，and the daisies in the grass at their feet seemed all at once to be staring at Johannes in alarm with their round white eyes．

“Did he give you the little key？”the girl went on．Johannes nodded；still he said nothing，but she wanted to know more about it．“Who was it？ Did he tell you all these things？ Where is he？”

“He is gone．—Now it is Robinetta—no one but Robinetta—only Robinetta．”He took her arm and laid his head against it．

“Silly boy！”she said，laughing，“I will make you find the Book；I know where it is．”

“But then I must go to fetch the key，and it is a long way off．”

“No，no，you need not．I can find it without the key．—To-morrow，I promise you，to-morrow．”

And as they walked homewards，the butterflies flitted in front of them．

That night，Johannes dreamed of his father，of Robinetta，and of many others．They were all good friends；they stood round him and looked at him kindly and trustfully．But on a sudden，their faces were changed，they looked coldly and laughed at him．He gazed about him in terror—on all sides there were none but angry，unfriendly faces．He felt a nameless misery，and awoke with a cry．





IX


Johannes had sat waiting for a long time．The air was chill， and heavy clouds swept over the scene in endless succession．They spread a dark grey mantle in wide folds，and lifted their proud heads to the bright light which shone above them．Sunshine and shadow chased each other with wonderful swiftness across the trees，like a fitfully blazing fire．Johannes was uneasy in his mind；he was thinking of the Book，not really believing that he should ever find it．Between the clouds very，very high up，he saw the clear，deep blue strewn with fleecy white clouds，soft and feathery，floating in calm and motionless rest．

“It must be like that！”thought he．“So high，so bright，so still！”

Then came Robinetta．Her bird was not with her．“It is all right， Johannes！”she cried out．“You may come and see the Book．”

“Where is Robin Redbreast？”said Johannes doubtfully．

“He did not come；as we are not going for a walk．”

So he went with her，still thinking to himself：“It cannot be．—It will not be like this，—it must be quite different．”

However，he followed the shining golden hair which lighted up the way．

Alas！Sad things now befell little Johannes．I wish that his history ended here．Did you ever have a beautiful dream of an enchanted garden，with flowers and beasts who loved you and talked to you？ And have you in your dream had the consciousness that you would presently awake，and all the glory of it vanish？ Then you try with all your might to hold it fast，and not to see the cold light of morning．

Johannes had just such a feeling as he followed Robinetta．

She led him into the big house，into a passage where his steps echoed．He could smell the scent of clothes and food；he thought of the long days when he had been kept indoors—of his school-days—and of everything in his life which had been cold and gloomy．

They went into a room full of men and women；how many，he could not see．They were talking，but as he went in they were silent．He noticed that the carpet had a pattern of huge，impossible flowers in gaudy colours．They were as strange and monstrous as those on the curtains in his bedroom at home．

“So that is the gardener's little boy？”said a voice opposite him．“Come here，my little friend；there is nothing to be afraid of．”

And another voice close to him said—“Well，Robbie，you have found a nice little companion．”

What did it all mean？ The deep lines gathered again above Johannes's dark childlike eyes，and he looked about him in bewilderment and alarm．

A man dressed in black sat near him，looking at him with cold，grey eyes．

“So you want to see the Book of Books？ I am surprised that your father，whom I know for a pious man，should not have put it into your hands before now．”

“You do not know my father；he is far，far away．”

“Indeed！Well，it is the same thing．Look here，my little friend！ Read this diligently；it shall show you the way of life—”

But Johannes had already recognised the Book．This was not what he wanted．No，something very different．He shook his head．

“No，no！that is not what I mean．I know this Book．This is not it．”

He heard exclamations of surprise，and felt the looks which were fixed on him from all sides．

“What？ What do you mean，little man？”

“I know this book．It is the book men believe in．But there is not enough in it—if there were，there would be peace and goodwill among men．And there is none．I mean something different—something which no one can doubt who sees it；in which it is written，precisely and clearly，why everything is as it is．”

“How is that possible？ Where can the boy have picked up such a notion？”

“Who taught you that，my little friend？”

“I am afraid that you have read some wicked books，child，and are talking like them．”

Thus spoke the various voices．Johannes felt his cheeks burning—his eyes were dim and dazzled—the room turned round，and the huge flowers on the carpet swayed up and down．Where was the little mouse who had so faithfully helped him that day in the school-room？ He wanted her badly．

“I am not talking like any book，and he who taught me what I know is worth more than all of you together．I know the language of flowers and animals，and am friends with them all．And I know too what men are，and how they live．I know all the fairies' secrets and the wood-sprites'；for they all love me—more than men do．”

Johannes heard sounds of disapprobation and laughter behind him，and all sides．There was a singing and roaring in his ears．

“He seems to have read Hans Andersen's tales．”

“He is not quite right in his head．”

The man opposite to him said：

“If you know Andersen，my little man，you ought to have more of his reverence for God and His Word．”

“For God！”He knew that word，and he remembered Windekind's teaching．

“I have no reverence for God．God is a great Petroleum-lamp which leads thousands to misery and misfortune．”

There was no laughter now，but a terrible silence，in which horror and amazement might be felt on all sides．Johannes was conscious of piercing looks，even at his back．It was like his dream of the night before．

The man in black stood up and took him by the arm．This hurt him and almost crushed his courage．

“Listen to me，youngster：I do not know whether you are utterly ignorant or utterly depraved，but I suffer no ungodly talk here．Go away，and never come in my sight again，I advise you．I will keep an eye on what becomes of you，but you never more set foot in this house．Do you understand？”

Every face was cold and hostile as he had seen them in his dream．

Johannes looked about him in anguish．

“Robinetta—where is Robinetta？”

“Ay indeed！You would contaminate my child！Beware if you ever dare to come here again！”

And the cruel grip led him down the echoing passage—the glass door slammed—and Johannes found himself outside，under the black driving clouds．He did not turn round，but stared straight before him as he slowly walked away．The sad furrows above his eyes were deeper，and did not smooth out again．

The Redbreast sat in a lime hedge looking after him．He stopped and gazed back，but did not speak；but there was no longer any confidence in the bird's timid sharp little eyes，and when Johannes took a step nearer，the quick little creature shot away in hasty flight．

“Away，away！Here is a man！”piped the sparrows who were sitting in a row on the garden path，and they fluttered away in all directions．

Even the open blossoms laughed no more，but looked grave and indifferent，as they do to all strangers．

Still Johannes did not heed these signs，but only thought how cruelly he had been hurt by those men；it was as though a cold hard hand had been laid on his inmost secret soul．“They shall believe me yet！”thought he．“I will fetch my little key and show it to them．”

“Johannes，Johannes！”called a tiny voice．There was a bird's nest in a holly bush and Wistik's big eyes peeped out over the edge of it．“Where are you off to？”

“It is all your fault！”said Johannes．“Leave me in peace．”

“What took you to talk with men？ Men can never understand you．Why do you tell men such things？ It is most foolish．”

“They laughed at me，and hurt me．They are detestable creatures！ I hate them．”

“No，Johannes；you love them．”

“No，no！”

“If you did not，it would not vex you so much to find yourself different from them；it could not matter to you what they say．You must learn to care less．”

“I want my key．I want to show it to them．”

“You must not do that；and they would not even then believe you．Of what use would it be？”

“I want my little key from under the rose-bush．Do you know where to find it？”

“Yes，certainly；by the pool you mean？ Yes，I know it．”

“Then take me there，Wistik．”

Wistik clambered up on Johannes's shoulder and showed him the way．They went on and on，all the day；the wind blew，and heavy rain fell from time to time，but towards evening the clouds ceased driving，and packed into long grey and gold bars．

When they reached the sand-hills which Johannes knew so well， his heart was sad within him，and he whispered again and again，“Windekind，Windekind！”

There was the rabbit-hole，and the sand-hill where he had fallen asleep．The grey reindeer-moss was soft and damp，and did not crack under his feet．The roses were all over，and the yellow evening-primroses with their faint oppressive scent opened their cups by hundreds．Higher yet grew the tall mulleins with their thick woolly leaves．

Johannes looked carefully to espy the small russet leaves of the wild rose．

“Where is it，Wistik？ I do not see it．”

“I know nothing of it，”said Wistik．“You buried the key，not I．”

Where the rose-tree had stood there was a plot covered with yellow Oenotheras staring heedlessly at the sky．Johannes questioned them，and the mullein too；but they were much too proud， for their tall stems rose far above his head；so he asked the little three-coloured pansies on the sandy ground．However，no one knew anything of the wild rose．They were all new-comers this summer， even the mullein，arrogant and tall as it was．

“Oh！where is it？ where is it？”

“Have you too deceived me？”cried Wistik．“I expected it；it is always so with men．”

And he let himself slip down from Johannes's shoulder，and ran away among the broom．

Johannes looked about him in despair—there stood a tiny wild rose-bush．

“Where is the big rose-bush？”asked Johannes；“the big one which used to stand here？”

“We never talk with human creatures，”said the shrub．That was the last thing he heard；everything remained silent．Only the broom-shrubs sighed in the light evening breeze．

“Am I then a man？”thought Johannes．“No！it cannot be，it cannot be！I will not be a man！I hate men！”

He was tired and sick at heart．He lay down at the edge of the meadow，on the soft grey moss which gave out a strong，damp scent．

“Now I cannot find my way back，and shall never see Robinetta again．Shall I not die if I have not Robinetta？ Shall I live and grow to be a man—a man like those others who laughed at me？”

On a sudden he saw once more the two white butterflies which came flying towards him from the side where the sun was setting．He watched them anxiously；would they show him the way？ They fluttered over his head，sometimes close together and sometimes far apart，flitting about as if in whimsical play．By degrees they went farther and farther from the sun，and vanished at last over the ridge of the sand-hills towards the wood，where only the topmost boughs were now red in the evening glow which blazed out brightly from beneath the long dark levels of cloud．

Johannes rose and went after them，but as they flew up over the first trees he saw that a black shadow followed them and overtook them with noiseless flight．The next instant they were gone．The black shade pounced swiftly down on them，and Johannes in terror covered his face with his hands．

“Well，my little friend，what have you to cry about？”said a sharp mocking voice close at hand．Johannes had seen a big bat coming towards him，but when he now looked up a little black dwarf not much taller than himself was standing on the sand-hill．He had a large head with big ears which stuck out dark against the bright evening sky；a lean shape and thin legs．Johannes could see nothing of his face but the small twinkling eyes．

“Have you lost anything，my little fellow？ Can I help you seek it？”said he．

But Johannes shook his head in silence．

“Look here．Would you like to have these？”he began again， opening his hand．In it Johannes saw something white which still moved a little．This was the two white butterflies，their crushed and broken wings quivering in their death-struggle．Johannes shuddered as though some one had blown against the nape of his neck，and he looked up in alarm at the strange being．“Who are you？”he asked．

“You would like to know my name？ Well，call me Pluizer—simply Pluizer．I have other prettier names，but you would not understand them yet．”

“Are you a man？”

“Better and better！Well，I have arms and legs and a head—see what a head—and the boy asks me whether lama man！Why， Johannes，Johannes！”And the mannikin laughed with a shrill piercing note．

“How do you know who I am？”asked Johannes．

“Oh，that，to me，is a mere trifle．I know a great deal more than that．I know whence you have come and what you came to do．I know a wonderful deal—almost everything．”

“Ah，Master Pluizer—”

“Pluizer，Pluizer—without any fine words．”

“Then do you know anything—”but Johannes was suddenly silent．“He is a man，”thought he．

“Of the little key，do you mean？ Why，to be sure！”

“But I did not think that any man could know about that．”

“Foolish boy！Besides，Wistik has told me all about it．”

“Then do you know Wistik too？”

“Oh yes！One of my best friends—and I have many friends．But I know it without Wistik．I know a great deal more than Wistik．Wistik is a very good fellow—but stupid，uncommonly stupid．Now， I am not！Far from it！”And Pluizer tapped his big head with his lean little hand．

“Do you know，Johannes，”he went on，“what Wistik's great defect is？—but you must never tell him，for he would be very angry．”

“Well，what is it？”said Johannes．

“He does not exist．That is a great defect，but he does not admit it．And he says the same of me，that I do not exist．But that is a lie．I not exist，indeed！What next，I wonder？”

And Pluizer put the butterflies into his satchel，and suddenly turning a somersault stood before Johannes on his head．Then，with a hideous grin，he stuck out a vile long tongue．Johannes，who did not feel at all at his ease alone with this strange being in the growing dusk on the deserted sand-hills，now fairly quaked with fear．

“This is a delightful manner of surveying the world，”said Pluizer，still upside down．“If you like I will teach you to do it．You see everything much clearer，and more life-like．”

And he flourished his little legs in the air and waltzed round on his hands．As the red light fell on his inverted face Johannes thought it perfectly horrible；those little eyes twinkled in the glow and showed the whites at the lower edge where it is not generally visible．

“You see，in this position the clouds seem to be the ground and the earth the top of the world．It is just as easy to maintain that as the converse．There is really no above or below．A very pretty place to walk on those clouds must be！”

Johannes looked up at the long stretches of cloud．They looked to him like a ploughed land，with red furrows，as though blood welled up from it．Just over the pool yawned the gate of the cloud-grotto．

“Can any one go there and enter in？”he asked．

“What nonsense！”said Pluizer，suddenly standing on his feet again，to Johannes's great relief，“Nonsense！If you were there you would find it just the same as here，and it would look as beautiful as that further on again．But in those lovely clouds it is all foggy and grey and cold．”

“I do not believe you，”cried Johannes．“Now I see you really are a man．”

“Come，come！You do not believe me，my little friend，because I am a man？ And what sort of creature are you then，I should like to know？”

“O Pluizer！Am I，too，really a man？”

“What do you suppose？ An elf？ Elves are never in love．”And Pluizer unexpectedly sat down on the ground at Johannes's feet with his leg crossed under him，staring at him with a villainous grin．Johannes was unutterably embarrassed and uncomfortable under his gaze，and wished he could escape or become invisible．But he could not even take his eyes off him．“Only men fall in love，Johannes，d'ye hear！And so much the better，or there would be none left by this time．And you are in love like the best of them，although you are but a little fellow．Of whom are you thinking at this moment？”

“Of Robinetta，”whispered Johannes，hardly above his breath．

“Whom do you most long for？”

“Robinetta．”

“Without whom do you think you could not live？”

Johannes's lips moved silently：“Robinetta．”

“Well then，youngster，”grinned Pluizer，“what made you fancy that you could be an elf？ Elves do not love the daughters of men．”

“But it was Windekind，”Johannes stammered out in his bewilderment．

But Pluizer flew into a terrible rage and his bony fingers gripped Johannes by the ears．“What folly is this？ Would you try to frighten me with that whippersnapper thing？ He is a greater simpleton than Wistik—much greater．He knows nothing at all．And what is worse， he does not exist in any sense，and never has existed．I only exist， do you understand？ And if you do not believe me，I will let you feel what I am．”

And he shook the hapless Johannes by the ears．Johannes cried out—“But I have known him such a long time，and have travelled such a long way with him！”

“You dreamed it，I tell you．Where are the rose bush and the little key，hey？ But you are not dreaming now．Do you feel that？”

“Oh！”cried Johannes，for Pluizer nipped him．

It was by this time dark，and the bats flew close over their heads and piped shrilly．The air was black and heavy，not a leaf was stirring in the wood．

“May I go home？”asked Johannes，—“home to my father？”

“To your father！What to do there？”said Pluizer．“A warm reception you will get from him after staying away so long．”

“I want to get home，”said Johannes，and he thought of the snug room with the bright lamp light where he would sit so often by his father's side，listening to the scratching of his pen．It was quiet there， and not lonely．

“Well then，you would have done better not to come away，and stayed so long for the sake of that senseless jackanapes who has not even any existence．Now it is too late，but it does not matter in the least；I will take care of you．And whether I do it or your father， comes to precisely the same in the end．Such a father—it is a mere matter of education．Did you choose your own father？ Do you suppose that there is no one so good or so clever as he？ I am just as good，and cleverer—much cleverer．”

Johannes had no heart to answer；he shut his eyes and nodded feebly．

“And it would be of no use to look for anything from Robinetta，”the little man went on．He laid his hands on Johannes's shoulders and spoke close into his ear．That child thought you just as much a fool as the others did．Did you not observe that she sat in the corner and never spoke a word when they all laughed at you？ She is no better than the rest．She thought you a nice little boy，and was ready to play with you—as she would have played with a cockchafer．She will not care that you are gone away．And she knows nothing of that Book．But I do；I know where it is，and I will help you to find it．I know almost everything．”

And Johannes was beginning to believe him．

“Now will you come with me？ Will you seek it with me？”

“I am so tired，”said Johannes，“let me sleep first．”

“I have no opinion of sleep，”replied Pluizer，“I am too active for that．A man must always be wide awake and thinking．But I will grant you a little time for rest．Till to-morrow morning！”

And he put on the friendliest expression of which he was capable．Johannes looked hard into his little twinkling eyes till he could see nothing else．His head was heavy and he lay down on the mossy knoll．The little eyes seemed to go further and further from him till they were starry specks in the dark sky；he fancied he heard the sound of distant voices，as though the earth beneath him were going away and away—and then he ceased to think at all．





X


Even before he was fairly awake，he was vaguely conscious that something strange had happened to him while he slept．Still he was not anxious to know what，or to look about him．He would rather return to the dream which was slowly fading like a rising mist—Robinetta had come to be with him again，and had stroked his hair as she used to do—and he had seen his father once more，and Presto， in the garden with the pool．

“Oh！That hurt！Who did that？”Johannes opened his eyes，and in the grey morning light，he saw a little man standing at his side who had pulled his hair．He himself was in bed，and the light was dim and subdued，as in a room．

But the face which bent over him at once carried him back to all the misery and distress of the past evening．It was Pluizer's face， less boguey-like and more human，but as ugly and terrifying as ever．

“Oh，no！Let me dream！”cried Johannes．

But Pluizer shook him．“Are you crazy，sluggard？ Dreaming is folly；you will never get any further by that．A man must work and think and search；that is what you are a man for．”

“I do not want to be a man．I want to dream．”

“I cannot help that；you must．You are now in my charge，and you must work and seek with me．With me alone can you ever find the thing you want．And I will not give in till we have found it．”

Johannes felt a vague dismay；still，a stronger will coerced and drove him．He involuntarily submitted．

The sand-hills，trees，and flowers had vanished．He was in a small dimly-lighted room；outside，as far as he could see，there were houses，and more houses，dingy and grey，in long dull rows．

Smoke rose from every one of them in thick wreaths，and made a sort of brown fog in the streets．And along those streets men were hurrying，like great black ants．A mingled，dull clamour came up from the throng without ceasing．

“Look，Johannes，”said Pluizer．“Now is not that a fine sight？ Those are men，and all the houses，whichever way you look，and as far as you can see—even beyond the blue towers there—are full of men—quite full from top to bottom．Is not that wonderful？ That is rather different from a sand-hill！”

Johannes listened with alarmed curiosity，as though some huge and hideous monster had risen up before him．He felt as if he stood on the creature's back，and could see the black blood flowing through its great arteries，and the murky breath streaming from its hundred nostrils．And the portentous hum of that terrible voice filled him with fears．

“Look how fast the men walk，”Pluizer went on．“You can see that they are in a hurry and are seeking something，cannot you？ But the amusing thing is，that not one of them knows exactly what he is seeking．When they have been seeking for some little time，some one comes to meet them—his name is Hein．”

“Who is he？”asked Johannes．

“Oh，a very good friend of mine．I will introduce you to him some day．Then Hein says to them，‘Are you looking for me？’To which most of them reply，‘Oh no．I do not want you！’But then Hein says again，‘But there is nothing to be found but me．’So they have to be satisfied with Hein．”

Johannes understood that he meant death．

“And is it always，always so？”

“To be sure，always．And yet，day after day，a new crowd come on，who begin forthwith to seek they know not what，and they seek and seek till at last they find Hein．This has been going on for a good while already，and so it will continue for some time yet．”

“And shall I never find anything，Pluizer—nothing but—？”

“Ay，you will find Hein some day，sure enough！but that does not matter；seek all the same—for ever be seeking．”

“But the Book，Pluizer，you were to make me find the Book．”

“Well who knows？ I have not taken back my word．We must seek it diligently．At any rate we know where to look for it；Wistik taught us that．And there are folks who spend all their lives in the search without even knowing so much as that．Those are the men of science，Johannes．But then Hein comes and it is all over with their search．”

“That is horrible，Pluizer！”

“Oh no，not at all！Hein is a very kind creature；but he is misunderstood．”

Some one was heard on the staircase outside the bedroom door．Tramp，tramp，up the wooden steps—tramp，tramp，—nearer and nearer．Then some one tapped at the door，and it was as though iron rapped against the panel．

A tall man came in．He had deep-set eyes and long lean hands．A cold draught blew into the room．

“Good-day，”said Pluizer，“so it is you！Sit down．We were just speaking of you．How are you getting on？”

“Busy，busy！”said the tall man，and he wiped the cold dews from his bald，bony forehead．

Without moving Johannes looked timidly into the deep-set eyes which were fixed on his．They were grave and gloomy，but not cruel， not angry．After a few minutes he breathed more freely and his heart beat less wildly．

“This is Johannes，”said Pluizer．“He has heard of a certain book in which it is written why everything is as it is，and we are now going to seek it together，are we not？”And Pluizer laughed significantly．

“Ay，indeed？ That is well！”said Death kindly，and he nodded to Johannes．

“He is afraid he will not find it，but I tell him first to seek it diligently．”

“To be sure，”said Death．“Seek diligently，that is the best way．”

“He thought，too，that you were very dreadful．But you see， Johannes，that you were mistaken．”

“Oh yes，”said Death good-humouredly，“men speak much evil of me．I am not attractive to look upon，but I mean well， nevertheless．”

He smiled faintly，as one who is occupied with more serious matters than those he is speaking of．Then he took his dark gaze from Johannes's face，and looked out thoughtfully over the great city．

For a long time Johannes dared not speak；but at last he said in a low voice—

“Are you going to take me with you？”

“What do you mean，my child？”said Death，roused from his meditations．“No，not now．You must grow up and become a good man．”

“I will not grow to be a man like all the rest．”

“Come，come，”said Death，“there is no help for it．”

And it was easy to hear that this was a frequent phrase with him．He went on—

“My friend Pluizer can teach you how to become a good man．There are various ways of being good，but Pluizer can teach you admirably．It is a very fine and noble thing to be a good man．You must never look down on a good man，my little fellow．”

“Seek，think，look about you，”said Pluizer．

“To be sure，to be sure，”said Death．And then he inquired of Pluizer：“To whom will you take him？”

“To Doctor Cypher，my old pupil．”

“Ah yes，—a very good pupil．A very capital example of a man！ Almost perfect in his own way．”

“Shall I see Robinetta again？”asked Johannes，trembling．

“What does the boy mean？”asked Death．

“Oh，he was in love，and fancied that he was an elf．Ha，ha，ha！”laughed Pluizer spitefully．

“No，no，my little man，that will never do，”said Death．“You will soon forget all that when you are with Doctor Cypher．Those who seek what you seek must give up everything else．All or nothing．”

“I shall make a real man of him．I will let him see some day what being in love really means，and then he will cast it from him altogether．”

And Pluizer laughed heartily．Death again fixed his black eyes on poor Johannes，who had some difficulty in refraining from sobbing．But he was ashamed to cry in the presence of Death．

Death suddenly rose．“I must be going，”said he．“I am wasting my time in talk，and there is much to be done．Good-bye， Johannes！—We shall meet again．But you must not be afraid of me．”

“I am not afraid of you；I wish you would take me with you．”

But Death gently pushed him away；he was used to such entreaties．

“No，Johannes．—Go now to your work in life；seek and see！ Ask me no more．I will ask you some day，and that will be quite soon enough．”

When he had disappeared Pluizer again began to behave in the wildest fashion．He leaped over the seats，turned somersaults， climbed up the cupboard and chimney-shelf，and played break-neck tricks at the open window．

“Well，that was Hein，my good friend Hein！”said he．“Did you not like him greatly？ A little unattractive and bony-looking，perhaps．But he can be very jolly too，when he takes pleasure in his work．Sometimes it bores him；it is rather monotonous．”

“Pluizer，who tells him where he is to go next？”

Pluizer stared at Johannes with a look of cunning inquiry．

“What makes you ask？—He goes where he pleases—He takes those he can catch．”

Later，Johannes came to see that it was not so．But as yet he knew no better，and thought that Pluizer was always right．

They went out and up the street，moving among the swarming throng．The men in their black clothes bustled about，laughing and talking so gaily that Johannes could not help wondering．He saw how Pluizer nodded to several，but no one returned the greeting；they all looked in front of them as if they did not even see him．

“They go by and laugh now，”said Pluizer，“as if they none of them knew me．But that is only make-believe．When I am alone with one of them they cannot pretend not to know me，and then they are not so light-hearted．”

And as they went on Johannes was presently aware of some one following them．When he looked round he saw that the tall pale figure was striding on among the people，with long noiseless steps．He nodded to Johannes．

“Do the people see him too？”asked Johannes of Pluizer．

“Certainly，but they do not choose to know him．Well，I pardon them for their arrogance！”

The crowd and the turmoil produced a sort of bewilderment which made Johannes forget his woes．The narrow streets and the high houses，which cut the blue heavens above into straight strips， the people going up and down them，the shuffling of feet and the clatter of vehicles，ousted the visions and dreams of the night，as a storm dissipates the images in a pool of water．It seemed to him that there was nothing in the world but walls，and windows，and men．He felt as if he too must do the same，and rush and push in the seething， breathless whirl．

Presently they came to a quieter neighbourhood，where a large house stood，with plain grey windows．It looked stern and unkindly．Everything was silent within，and Johannes smelt a mixture of sour， unfamiliar odours，with a damp，cellar-like atmosphere for their background．In a room filled with strange-looking instruments sat a lonely man．He was surrounded by books，and glass and copper objects，all unknown to Johannes．A single ray of sunshine fell into the room above his head，and sparkled on flasks full of bright-coloured liquids．The man was gazing fixedly through a copper tube and did not look up．

As Johannes approached he could hear him murmuring，

“Wistik，Wistik！”

By the man's side，on a long black board，lay something white and furry which Johannes could not see very clearly．

“Good-morning，doctor，”said Pluizer；but the doctor did not move．

But Johannes was startled，for the white object which he was watching intently，suddenly began to move convulsively．What he had seen was the white fur of a rabbit lying on its back．The head， with the mobile nose，was fixed in an iron clamp，and its four little legs were firmly bound to its body．The hopeless effort to get free was soon over，then the little creature lay still again，and only the rapid movement of its bleeding throat showed that it was still alive．

And Johannes saw its round，gentle eye staring wide in helpless terror，and he felt as if he recognised the poor little beast．Was not that the soft little body against which he had slept that first delightful night with the elves？ Old memories crowded in his mind；he flew to the rabbit．

“Wait，wait！Poor rabbit！I will release you！”and he hastily tried to cut the cords which bound the tender little paws．

But his hands were tightly clutched，and a sharp laugh sounded in his ear．

“What do you mean by this，Johannes？ Are you still such a baby？ What must the doctor think of you？”

“What does the boy want？ What brings him here？”asked the doctor in surprise．

“He wants to become a man，so I have brought him to you．But he is still young and childish．That is not the way to find what you are seeking，Johannes．”

“No，that is not the way，”said the doctor．

“Doctor，set the rabbit free！”

But Pluizer held him by both hands till he hurt him．

“What did we agree on，little man？”he whispered in his ear．“To seek diligently，was it not？ We are not on the sand-hills now， with Windekind and the dumb brutes．We are to be men—men．Do you understand？ If you mean to remain a child，if you are not strong enough to help me，I will send you about your business and you may seek by yourself．”

Johannes was silent，and believed him．He would be strong．He shut his eyes so that he might not see the rabbit．

“My dear boy，”said the doctor，“you seem still too tender-hearted to begin．To be sure—the first time it is horrible to look on．I myself，for some time，was most averse to it，and avoided it as far as possible．But it is indispensable；and you must remember we are men and not brutes，and the advancement of mankind and of science is of more importance than a few rabbits．”

“Do you hear？”said Pluizer，—“science and mankind．”

“The man of science，”the doctor went on，“stands far above all other men．But he must make all the smaller feelings which are common to the vulgar give way to the one grand idea of science．Will you be such a man？ Is that your vocation，my boy？”

Johannes hesitated；he did not know justly what a vocation might be—any more than the cockchafer．

“I want to find the book of which Wistik spoke，”said he．

The doctor looked surprised and asked，“Wistik？”

Pluizer hastened to reply．“He will，doctor；I know he really will．He desires to seek the highest wisdom and to understand the true nature of tilings．”

Johannes nodded，“Yes！”So far as he understood the matter， that was what he meant．

“Very well；but then you must be strong，Johannes，and not timid and soft-hearted．Then I can help you．But remember：all or nothing．”

And with trembling fingers Johannes helped to tighten the relaxed cords round the rabbit's little paws．





XI


“Now we shall see，”said Pluizer，“whether I cannot show you just as pretty things as Windekind did．”

And when they had taken leave of the doctor，promising to return soon，he led Johannes into every nook and corner of the great town；he showed him how the Monster lived，how he breathed and took in food，how he digested within and expanded without．

But what he liked best were the gloomy back slums，where men sat closely packed，where everything was grey and grizzly，and the air black and heavy．

He took him into one of the great buildings from which the smoke rose which Johannes had seen the first day．The place was filled with deafening noise—thumping，rattling，hammering and droning—great wheels were turning and long belts sliding endlessly onward；the walls and floors were black，the windows broken and murky．The towering chimneys rose high above the dingy structure， and poured forth thick wreaths of smoke．Amid the turmoil of wheels and axles，Johannes saw numbers of men with pale faces and blackened hands and clothes，working busily without a word．

“Who are they？”he asked．

“Wheels，wheels too，”said Pluizer with a laugh，“or men，if you choose to call them so．And what you see them doing，they do from morning to night．Even so，they can be men—after their own fashion，of course．”

Then they passed along filthy streets，where the strip of heavenly blue seemed no more than a finger's breadth wide，and was still more shut out by clothes hung out to air．These alleys were swarming with people，who jostled each other，shouted，laughed and sometimes even sang．In the houses here，the rooms were so small， so dark and foul，that Johannes could scarcely breathe．He saw squalid children crawling about on the bare floor，and young girls with tangled hair crooning songs to pale，hungry babies．He heard quarrelling and scolding，and every face he looked upon was weary， or stupid and indifferent．

It filled Johannes with a strange sudden pang．It had nothing in common with any former pain，and he felt ashamed of it．

“Pluizer，”said he，“have men always lived here in such grief and misery？ And when I—”he dared not finish the question．

“To be sure，and a happy thing too．They are not in such grief and misery；they are used to it and know no better．They are mere animals，ignorant and indifferent．Look at those two women sitting in front of their door；they look out on the dirty street as contentedly as you used to gaze at the sand-hills．You need not worry yourself about the lot of man．You might as well cry over the lot of the moles who never see daylight．”

And Johannes did not know what to answer，nor what，then，he ought to weep over．

And ever through the noisy throng and bustle，he still saw the pale，hollow-eyed figure marching on with noiseless steps．

“A good man，don't you think？”said Pluizer．“He takes them away from this at any rate．But even here men are afraid of him．”

When night had fallen and hundreds of lights flared in the wind， casting long，straggling reflections in the black water，they made their way down the quiet streets．The tall old houses seemed tired out，and asleep as they leaned against each other．Most of them had their eyes shut；but here and there a window still showed a pale gleam of yellow light．

Pluizer told Johannes many a long tale of those who dwelt within，of the sufferings which were endured there，and the struggle waged between misery and the love of life．He spared him nothing：he sought out the gloomiest，the lowest，the most dreadful facts，and grinned with delight as Johannes turned pale and speechless at his horrible tales．

“Pluizer，”Johannes suddenly asked，“do you know anything about the Great Light？”

He thought the question might deliver him from the darkness which grew thicker and more oppressive about him．

“All nonsense！”said Pluizer．“Windekind's nonsense！Mere visions and dreams！Men alone exist—and I myself．Do you suppose that a God，or anything at all like one，could take pleasure in governing such a muddle as prevails on this earth？ And such a Great Light would not shine here in the dark．”

“But the stars，what about the stars？”asked Johannes as if he expected that the visible Splendour would raise up the squalor before him．

“The stars！Do you know of what you are talking，boy？ There are no lights up there like the lamps you see about you here below．The stars are nothing but worlds，a great deal larger than this world with its thousand cities，and we move among them like a speck of dust；and there is no‘above’or‘below，’but worlds all round，and on every side more worlds，and no end of them anywhere．”

“No，no！”cried Johannes in horror．“Do not say so，do not say so！I can see the lights against a great dark background overhead．”

“Very true．You cannot see anything but lights．If you stared up at the sky all your life long you would still see nothing but lights against a dark background overhead．But，you know，you must know， that there is no above nor beneath．Those are worlds，amid which this clod of earth，with its wretched，struggling mass of humanity，is as nothing—and will vanish into nothing．Do not ever speak of‘the stars’in that way，as though there were but a few dozen of them．It is foolishness．”

Johannes said no more．The immensity which ought to have elevated the squalor had crushed it．

“Come along，”said Pluizer．“Now we will go to see something amusing．”At intervals bursts of delightful，soft music were wafted to their ears．On a dark slope in front of them stood a large building with lamps blazing in its numerous long windows．A row of carriages was in waiting outside；the pawing of the horses rang hollow through the silent night，and as they shook their heads， sparks of light shone on the silver fittings of their harness，and on the varnish of the coaches．

Inside，everything was a blaze of light．Johannes was half blinded as he gazed，by the hundreds of candles，the bright colours， the glitter of mirrors and flowers．Gay figures flitted across the windows，bowing to each other，with laughter and gestures．Beyond， at the other side of the room，richly dressed persons were moving about with slow dignity or spinning with swift，swaying motion．A confused sound of laughter and merry voices，of shuffling feet and rustling dresses came through the front door，mingling with the waves of that soft bewitching music which Johannes had already heard from afar．In the street，close to the windows，stood a few dark figures，their faces only strangely lighted up by the illumination within，at which they stared with avidity．

“That is pretty！That is splendid！”cried Johannes，delighted at the sight of so much light and colour，and so many flowers．“What is going on in there？ May we go in？”

“Indeed！So you really think that pretty？ Or do you not prefer a rabbit-hole？ Look at the people as they laugh，and bow，and glitter．See how stately and polite the men are；and how gay and fine the ladies！And how solemnly they dance，as if it were the most important thing on earth．”

Johannes recalled the ball in the rabbit-burrow，and he saw a great deal which reminded him of it．But here，everything was much grander and more brilliant．The young ladies in their beautiful array seemed to him as lovely as elves，as they raised their long，bare arms，and bent their heads on one side in the dance．The servants moved about incessantly，offering elegant refreshments with respectful bows．

“How splendid！How splendid！”cried Johannes．

“Very pretty，is it not？”said Pluizer．“But now you must learn to look a little further than the end of your nose．You see nothing there but happy smiling faces？ Well，the greater part of all that mirth is falsehood and affectation．The friendly old ladies in the corner sit there like anglers round a pond；the young girls are the bait，the men are the fish．And affectionately as they gossip together，they envy and grudge each other every fish that bites．If either of the young ladies feels some pleasure，it is because she has a prettier dress than the rest，or secures more partners；the pleasure of the men chiefly consists in the bare shoulders and arms of the ladies．Behind all these bright eyes and pleasant smiles there lurks something quite different．Even the thoughts of the respectful servants are very far from respectful．If suddenly every one should give utterance to his real thoughts the party would soon be at an end．”

And when Pluizer pointed it all out to him，Johannes could plainly see the insincerity of the faces and manners of the company，and the vanity，envy，and weariness which showed through the smiling mask，or were suddenly revealed as though it had just been taken off．

“Well，”said Pluizer，“they must do things in their own way．Human creatures must have some amusement，and they know no other way．”

Johannes was aware of some one standing just behind him．He looked round；it was the well-known tall figure．The pale face was strangely lighted up by the glare，so that the eyes showed as large dark caverns．He was muttering softly to himself and pointed with one finger into the splendid ball-room．

“Look，”said Pluizer，“he is seeking out some one．”

Johannes looked where the finger pointed，and he saw how the old lady who was speaking closed her eyes and put her hand to her head；and how a fair young girl paused in her slow walk，and stared before her with a slight shiver．

“How soon？”Pluizer asked of Death．

“That is my affair，”was the answer．

“I should like to show Johannes this same company once more，”said Pluizer with a grin and a wink，“can I do it？”

“This evening？”asked Death．

“Why not？”said Pluizer．“There，time and the hour are no more．What now is has always been，and what shall be，is now already．”

“I cannot go with you，”said Death．“I have too much to do．But speak the name we both know and you can find the way without me．”

Then they went a little way along the deserted streets where the gas was flaring in the night wind，and the dark cold water plashed against the sides of the canals．The soft music grew fainter and fainter，and at last died away in the hush which lay over the town．

Presently，from high above them，a loud and festal song rang out with a deep，echoing，metallic ring．

It came down suddenly from the tall church tower on the sleeping city，and into little Johannes' sad and gloomy soul．He looked up much startled．The chime rang on with clear，steady tones， rising joyfully in the air，and boldly scaring the death-like silence．The glad strain struck him as strange—a festal song in the midst of noiseless sleep and blackest woe．

“That is the clock，”said Pluizer，“it is always cheerful，year in， year out．It sings the same song every hour，with the same vigour and vivacity；and it sounds more gleeful by night than even by day， as if the clock rejoiced that it has no need of sleep，that it can sing at all times with equal contentment，while thousands，just below，are weeping and suffering．But it sounds most gladly when some one is just dead．”

Again the jubilant peal rang out．

“One day，Johannes，”Pluizer went on，“a dim light will be burning in a quiet room，behind just such a window as that yonder；a melancholy light，flickering pensively，and making the shadows dance on the wall．There will be no sound in that room but now and then a low，suppressed sob．A bed will be standing there，with white curtains，and long shadows in their folds．In the bed something will be lying—white and still．That will have been little Johannes．And then，how loud and joyful will that chime sound，breaking into the room，and singing out the first hour after his death！”

Twelve was striking，booming through the air with long pauses between the strokes．At the last stroke，Johannes，all at once，had a strange feeling as though he were dreaming；he was no longer walking，but floating along a little way above the ground，holding Pluizer's hand．The houses and lamps sped past him in swift flight．And now the houses stood less close together．They formed separate rows，with dark，mysterious gaps between them，where the gas lamps lighted up trenches，puddles，scaffoldings and woodwork．At last they reached a great gate，with heavy pillars and a tall railing．In a winking，they had floated over it and come down again on some soft grass by a high heap of sand．Johannes fancied he must be in a garden，for he heard the rustling of trees hard by．

“Now pay attention，and then confess whether I cannot do greater things than Windekind．”

Then Pluizer shouted aloud a short and awful name which made Johannes quake．The darkness on all sides echoed the sound，and the wind bore it up in widening circles till it died away in the upper air．

And Johannes saw the grass blades growing so tall that they were above his head，and a little pebble which but just now was under his feet，seemed to be close to his face．Pluizer，by his side，and no bigger than he was，picked up the stone with both hands and threw it away with all his might．A confused noise of thin，shrill voices rose up from the spot he had cleared．

“Hey day！who is doing that？ What is the meaning of it？ Lout！”they could hear said．

Johannes saw black objects running in great confusion．He recognised the quick，nimble ground-beetle，the shining，brown ear-wig with his fine nippers，the millipede with its round back and thousand tiny feet，in the midst of them a long earthworm shrank back as quick as lightning into its burrow！

Pluizer made his way through the angry swarm of creatures to the worm's hole．

“Hey there！you long，naked crawler！come up and show yourself once more with your sharp red nose！”he cried．

“What do you want？”asked the worm from below．

“You must come out，because I want to go in；do you hear，you bare-skinned sand-eater！”

The worm cautiously put his pointed head out of the hole，felt all round it two or three times，and then slowly dragged his naked ringed body up to the surface．

Pluizer looked round at the other creatures who had crowded curiously about them．

“One of you must go first with a light—no，Master Beetle， you are too stout，and you with your thousand feet would make me giddy．Hey，you ear-wig！I like your looks．Come with me and carry a light in your nippers．You，beetle，must look about for a will-o'-the-wisp，or fetch a chip of rotten wood．”

The creatures were scared by his commanding tones and obeyed him．

Then they went down into the worm's burrow；the ear-wig first，with the shining wood，then Pluizer，and then Johannes．It was a narrow passage and very dark down there．Johannes saw the grains of sand glittering in the dim blue gleam．They looked like large stones，half transparent and built up into a smooth firm wall by the worm's body．The worm himself followed，full of curiosity．Johannes saw the pointed head come close up behind him，and then stop till the long body had been dragged after it．

Down they went，without speaking，far and deep．When the path was too steep for Johannes，Pluizer helped him．They seemed never to be coming to an end；still fresh galleries of sand，and still the ear-wig crept on，turning and bending with the sinuosities of the passage．At last this grew broader，and the walls opened out．The grains of sand were black and wet，forming a vault overhead，down which driblets of water made shining streaks，while the roots of trees came through in coils like petrified snakes．

And suddenly there rose before Johannes's eyes an upright wall， black and high，cutting off all space beyond．The ear-wig turned round．

“Here we are．The next question is how to get any further．The worm ought to know；he is at home here．”

“Come on；show us the way，”said Pluizer．

The worm slowly dragged his jointed body up to the black wall and felt it inquisitively．Johannes could see that it was of wood．Here and there it had fallen into brownish powder．The worm bored his way into one such place and the long，wriggling body vanished with three pushes and pauses．

“Now for you，”said Pluizer，pushing Johannes into the little round opening．For a moment he thought he should be suffocated in the soft damp stuff，but he soon felt his head free，and with some trouble worked his way completely through．A large room seemed to lie open before him；the floor was hard and moist，the air thick and intolerably oppressive．Johannes could scarcely breathe，and stood waiting in mortal terror．

He heard Pluizer's voice，which sounded hollow，as in some vast cellar．

“Here，Johannes，follow me．”

He felt the ground before him rise to a hill—and he climbed it， clutching Pluizer's hand in the darkness．He trod，as it were，on a carpet which yielded under his foot．He trampled over hollows and ridges，following Pluizer who led him on to a level spot where he held on by some long stems which bent in his hand like reed-grass．

“Here we can stand very comfortably．Bring a light，”said Pluizer．

The dim light came on from a distance，up and down with its bearer．The nearer it approached，and the more its pale gleam spread in the place they were in，the more terrible became Johannes's anguish of mind．

The eminence on which he stood was long and white；the support he clung to was brown，and lay about in glistening waves and curls．

He recognised the features of a human being，and the icy level on which he stood was the forehead．

Before him lay the sunken eyes，two deep，dark hollows，and the blue gleam fell on the pinched nose and ashy lips which were parted in the hideous，rigid smile of death．

Pluizer laughed sharply，but the sound seemed smothered by the damp，wooden walls．

“Is not this a surprise，Johannes？”

The worm crept up along the plaits of the shroud：he glided over the chin and the stiffened lips and into the mouth．

“This was the beauty of the ball，whom you thought lovelier even than an elf．Then her hair and dress shed sweet fragrance；then her eyes sparkled and her lips smiled．Now，—look at her！”

With all his horror there was doubt in Johannes's eyes．So soon？ The splendour was but now—and already——？

“Do you not believe me？”grinned Pluizer．“Half a century lies between now and then．Time and the hour are no more．What has been shall always be，and what shall be has ever been．You could not conceive of it，but you must believe it．Everything here is the truth．All I tell you is true！True！—and Windekind could not say that．”

With a nod and a grimace he leaped round the dead face，and played the most horrible antics．He sat on the eyebrows and raised the eyelids by the long lashes．The eye，which Johannes had seen bright with gladness，stared dull and white in the pale light．

“Now onwards！”cried Pluizer．“There is more yet to be seen．”

The worm came creeping up from a corner of the mouth，and the dreadful march began once more．

Not back again，but along new paths，no less long and gloomy．

“This is much older，”said the earthworm as he made his way through another black wall．“This has been here a very long time．”

It was less dreadful here than before．Johannes saw nothing but a confused mass，out of which brown bones projected．Hundreds of insects were silently busy here．The light startled and alarmed them．

“Where do you come from？ Who brings a light here？ We want no light．”

And they hastily vanished into the folds and crevices．But they recognised a fellow-creature．

“Have you been in the next one？”asked the worms．“The wood is still hard．”

The first worm denied it．“He wants to keep the find to himself，”said Pluizer to Johannes in a low voice．

Then they went forward again；Pluizer explained everything， and pointed out persons whom Johannes had known．They came to an ugly face with prominent，staring eyes，and thick dark lips and cheeks．

“This was a very fine gentleman，”said he in high glee．“You should have seen him—so rich，so fashionable，so arrogant．He is as much puffed up as ever！”

And so they went on．There were lean and haggard faces with white hair that shone blue in the feeble light，and little children with large heads and old-looking，anxious features．

“These，you see，died first and grew old afterwards，”said Pluizer．

They came to a man with a flowing beard and parted lips， showing glistening white teeth．There was a round black hole in the middle of his forehead．

“This one lent Death a helping hand．Why had he not a little patience？ He would have come here in the end．”

Through passage after passage，one after another，they passed， no end of them—straight-laid figures，with rigid，grinning faces，and motionless hands laid one over the other．

“Now I can go no further，”said the ear-wig．“I do not know my way beyond this．”

“Let us turn back，”said the worm．

“One more，one more！”cried Pluizer．So on they went．

“Everything you see here，actually exists，”said Pluizer，as they made their way forward．“It is all real．One thing only is not real， and that is yourself，Johannes．You are not here；you cannot come here．”

And he laughed maliciously as he saw Johannes's terrified and bewildered face at these words．

“This is the last，positively the last．”

“The way stops here．I am going no further，”said the ear-wig crossly．

“I will go further，”said Pluizer；and where the path ended he began grubbing the earth with both hands．“Help me，Johannes．”

And Johannes，submissive with wretchedness，obeyed，scratching away the fine damp soil．

Silent and breathless they worked away till they came to the black wood．

The worm had drawn back his ringed head and disappeared．The ear-wig dropped the light and turned away．

“It is impossible to get in，the wood is new，”said he as he withdrew．

“I will do it！”said Pluizer，and with his clawed fingers he tore long white splinters cracking out of the wood．

A fearful anguish came over Johannes．But he could not help himself；there was no escape．

At last the dark thing was opened．Pluizer seized the light and hurried in．

“Here，here！”he cried，running to the head．

But when Johannes came as far as the hands，which lay quietly folded over the breast，he stopped．He gazed at the thin white fingers，dimly lighted from above．On a sudden，he recognised them，—he knew the shape and turn of the fingers，the look of the long nails，now blue and dull．He recognised a brown spot on one of the forefingers．These were his own hands．

“Here，this way！”Pluizer called from the head．“Only look，do you know him？”

Hapless Johannes tried to stand up and go towards the light which winked at him；but he could not．The gleam died into total darkness and he fell senseless．





XII


He had sunk into deep sleep—that sleep which is too deep for dreams．

When he came out of the darkness—very slowly—into the cool grey light of dawn，he passed through varied and peaceful dreams of an early time．He woke up，and they glided off his soul，like dew-drops off a flower．

The look in his eyes was calm and sweet as they still gazed on the crowd of lovely images．

But he closed them again quickly as though the glare were painful，to shut out the pale daylight．He saw just what he had seen the morning before．It seemed to him far away and a long time ago．Still，hour by hour，he remembered it all，from the dreary day-break to the terrible night．He could not believe that all these horrors had come upon him in a single day．The beginning of his wretchedness seemed so remote，lost in grey mist．

The sweet dreams vanished，and left no trace on his spirit；Pluizer shook him，and the dreadful day began，gloomy and colourless；the first of many，many more．

But all he had seen last night in that terrible walk dwelt in his mind．Had it been no more than a fearful vision？

When he asked Pluizer doubtfully，he looked at him with mockery and amazement．

“What do you mean？”he said．

But Johannes did not see the sarcasm in his eyes，and asked whether all this，which he still saw so plainly and clearly，had not indeed been true．

“Why，Johannes，how silly you are！Such a thing could never happen at all．”

And Johannes did not know what to think．

“We must set you to work at once，and then you will ask no more such foolish questions．”

So they went to Doctor Cypher，who was to help Johannes to find what he sought．

But as they went along the crowded street，Pluizer suddenly stood still，and pointed out a man in the throng．

“Do you remember him？”asked Pluizer，and he laughed aloud when Johannes turned pale and stared at the man in terror．

He had seen him last night，deep under ground．

The doctor received them kindly and imparted his learning to Johannes，who listened to him for hours that day—and for many days after．

The doctor had not found what they sought；but was very near it，he said．He would lead Johannes as far as he himself had gone， and then，together，they would be sure to achieve to it．

Johannes learned and listened，diligently and patiently—day after day，and month after month．He had very little hope，but he understood that he must go on now，as far as possible．He thought it strange that the longer he sought the light the darker it grew around him．The beginning of everything，he learned，was the best part of it，but the deeper he got the duller and more obscure it became．He began with the study of plants and animals，of everything about him，and when he had studied these a long time they all turned to numbers．Everything resolved itself into numbers—pages of figures．This Doctor Cypher thought quite splendid；he said that light would come to them as the numbers came，but to Johannes it was darkness．

Pluizer never left him，and drove and urged him on when he was disheartened or weary．His presence marred every moment of enjoyment and admiration．

Johannes was amazed and delighted when he learnt and saw how exquisitely flowers were constructed，how the fruit was formed， and how insects unconsciously helped in the process．

“That is beautiful！”he exclaimed．“How exactly it is all arranged，and how delicately and accurately contrived！”

“Yes，amazingly contrived，”said Pluizer．“The pity is that the greater part of this ingenuity and accuracy comes to nothing．How many flowers produce fruit，and how many seeds become trees？”

“But still，it seems to be all wrought by some grand plan，”said Johannes．“Look，the bees seek honey for their own ends and do not know that they are serving the flowers，and the flowers attract the bees by their colours．That is a scheme，and they both work it out without knowing it．”

“That all looks very pretty，but it fails in many ways．When the bees have a chance，they bite a hole through the flower and make the whole internal structure useless．He is a clever Contriver indeed who can be laughed to scorn by a bee！”

And when he came to study the organism of men and beasts，matters were even worse．Whenever Johannes thought anything beautiful or well adapted，Pluizer would demonstrate its imperfections and inefficiency．He expatiated on the host of ills and woes to which every living creature is liable，selecting by preference the most disgusting and terrible．

“The Contriver，Johannes，was very shrewd，but in everything he made he forgot something，and men have as much as they can do to patch up these defects as best they may．You have only to look about you．An umbrella，a pair of spectacles—for shelter and better sight—these are specimens of man's patching．They are no part of the original plan．But the Contriver never considered that men would have colds，and read books，and do a thousand other things for which his plan was inadequate．He gave his children clothes without reflecting that they would outgrow them．Almost all men have by this time long outgrown their natural outfit．Now they do everything for themselves，and never trouble themselves at all about the Contriver and his schemes．What he failed to give them，they simply take by brute force；and when the obvious result is that they must die，they evade death，sometimes for a long period，by a variety of devices．”

“But it is men's own fault，”said Johannes．“Why do they wilfully deviate from the laws of nature？”

“Oh，silly Johannes！If a nursemaid lets an innocent child play with fire and it is burned，whose fault is it？ The child's，who knew nothing about fire；or the nurse's，who knew that it would burn itself？ And who is to blame if men pine in misery and disobedience to nature—they or the all-wise Contriver，compared with whom we are ignorant children？”

“But they are not ignorant，they know—”

“Johannes，if you say to a child：Do not touch that fire，it will hurt you—and if the child touches it all the same because it does not know what pain is，can you then plead your own innocence and say：The child was not ignorant？ Did you not know that it would not heed your advice？ Men are as foolish as children．Glass is brittle and clay is soft．And He who made men and did not take their folly into account，is like a man who should make weapons of glass and not expect them to break，or arrows of clay and not expect them to bend．”

His words fell like drops of liquid fire on Johannes's soul，and his heart swelled with a great grief to which his former woes were as nothing，and which often made him weep in the silent，sleepless hours of the night．

Oh，for sleep！sleep！There came a time after long days，when nothing was so dear to him as sleep．Then he neither thought nor suffered；in his dreams he was always carried back to his old life．It seemed to him beautiful as he dreamed of it，but day by day he could never remember exactly how things had then been．He only knew that the vexations and cravings of that former time were better than the vacant，stagnant feeling of the present．He once had longed bitterly for Windekind；he once had waited hour after hour on Robinetta．How delightful that had been！

Robinetta！Did he still long for her？ The more he learnt the feebler that craving became．For that too was dissected，and Pluizer showed him what love really was．Then he felt ashamed，and Doctor Cypher said that he could not as yet express it in numbers，but that he should soon accomplish this．Then things grew darker and darker round little Johannes．

He had an obscure feeling of thankfulness that he had not seen Robinetta in the course of that fearful expedition with Pluizer．

When he spoke of it to Pluizer he made no reply but a sly laugh；but Johannes understood that this was from no desire to spare him．

Those hours which Johannes did not spend in study or work Pluizer took advantage of to show him the life of men．He managed to take him everywhere—into the hospitals where sick people lay in great numbers—long ranks of pale，haggard faces with a dull， suffering expression—and where unearthly silence reigned，broken only by coughing and groaning．And Pluizer showed him how many of them could never leave the place．And when at a fixed hour streams of men and women came pouring into the place to visit their sick relations，Pluizer said：“You see，they all know that they too must some day find their way into this house and these gloomy rooms，only to be carried out in a black chest．”

“Then how can they ever be so light-hearted？”thought Johannes．

And Pluizer took him up to a little attic-room where a dismal twilight reigned，and where the distant tinkle of a piano in a neighbouring house made an incessant dreamy noise．Here they found，among others，one man who lay staring helplessly before him at a narrow sunbeam which slowly crept up the wall．

“He has lain there for seven years，”said Pluizer．“He was a sailor，and has seen the palms of India，the blue seas of Japan，the forests of Brazil；and now，for seven long years，he has amused himself all day and every day with the sunbeams and the sound of the piano．He will never leave this room again；but it cannot last much longer now．”

After this day Johannes had his worst dream；he fancied himself in that little room，listening to the feeble music，in the melancholy half-light，with nothing to look at but the rising and waning sun-beams—never more till the end．

Pluizer took him，too，to the great churches to listen to what was said there．He took him to festivals and grand ceremonies，and made him intimate in many houses．

Johannes learnt to study men，and it sometimes happened that he could not help thinking of his past life，of the tales Windekind had told him and of his own disappointments．There were men who reminded him of the glow-worm，who fancied that the stars were his departed friends；or of the cockchafer who was one day older than his comrade，and who had said so much about a vocation；and he heard tales which made him think of Kribbelgauw，the Spider-Hero，and of the eel who did nothing，but was fed because it was a grand thing to have a fat king．Himself，he could only compare to the younger cockchafer，who did not know what a vocation was， and flew to the light．He felt that he in the same way was creeping， helpless and crippled，over the carpet with a string round his body，a cruel string which Pluizer tugged and twitched．

Ah！he should never see the garden again！When would the heavy foot come and crush him to death？

Pluizer laughed at him if he ever spoke of Windekind；and by degrees he began to think that Windekind had never existed．

“But，Pluizer，then the little key does not exist—nothing is real！”

“Nothing，nothing．Men and numbers—those are real and exist， endless numbers！”

“Then you deceived me，Pluizer．Let me go away—let me seek no more—leave me alone．”

“Have you forgotten what Death told you？ That you are to become a man，a complete man？”

“I will not！it is horrible！”

“You must．You wished it once．Look at Doctor Cypher，does he think it horrible？ Become like him—”

It was very true．Doctor Cypher seemed always content and happy．Unwearied and imperturbable，he pursued his way，studying and teaching，satisfied and equable．

“Look at him，”Pluizer went on，“he sees everything，and yet sees nothing．He looks on men as though he himself were a being apart，having nothing to do with their sufferings．He moves among griefs and wretchedness as though he were invulnerable，and meets Death face to face as though he were immortal．All he aims at is to understand what he sees，and everything is good in his eyes that comes in the way of knowledge．He is satisfied with everything so long as he understands it．That is what you must be．”

“But that I can never be．”

“Well，I cannot help that．”

This was the hopeless conclusion of all their discussions．Johannes grew dull and indifferent，and searched and searched， knowing no longer why，or for what．He had become like the multitudes of whom Wistik had spoken．

It was now winter，but he scarcely observed it．

One chill and misty morning，when the snow lay wet and dirty on the roads，and fell from the trees and roofs，he went with Pluizer for his daily walk．

In a public garden he met a party of young girls，in a row， and carrying school-books．They pelted each other with snow，and laughed and gambolled；their voices rang out clearly over the snowy plain．There was no sound of feet or wheels to be heard；nothing but the tinkling bells of the horses，or the latch of a shop door．Their merry laughter sounded distinctly through the silence．

Johannes noted that one of these damsels looked at him and stared back after him．She wore a coloured cloak and a black hat．He knew her face very well，but he could not think who she was．She nodded to him once and again．

“Who is that？ I know her．”

“Yes，very likely．Her name is Maria，some persons call her Robinetta．”

“No，that cannot be．She is not like Windekind．She is a girl like any other．”

“Ha，ha，hah！She cannot be like Nobody．But she is what she is．You have longed to see her so much；now I will take you to see her！”

“No，I do not want to see her．I would rather see her dead like the others．”

And Johannes would not look round again，but hurried on， murmuring：

“This is the last！There is nothing—nothing！”





XIII


The clear warm sunshine of an early spring morning shone down on the great city．Its bright rays fell into the room where Johannes lived，and on the low ceiling danced and flickered a large patch of light reflected from the rippling water in the canal．

Johannes sat by the window in the sunshine，looking out over the town．Its aspect was completely changed．The grey fog was now a sheeny blue sun-mist，veiling the end of the long streets and the distant towers．The slopes of the slate roofs shone like silver．All the houses showed clear outlines and bright surfaces in the sunshine；the pale blue atmosphere was full of glittering warmth．The water seemed alive．The brown buds of the elm-trees were swollen and shiny，and loudly-chirping sparrows fluttered among the branches．

A strange feeling came over Johannes as he sat looking out on it all．The sunshine filled him with sweet vague emotion，a mixture of oblivion and ecstasy．He gazed dreamily at the dancing ripples，the bursting leaf-buds；he listened to the chirping of the birds．There was gladness in their tune．

He had not for a long time felt so soft at heart，nor for many a day been so happy．

This was the sunshine of old；he knew it well．This was the sun which of yore called him forth—out into the garden where，under the shelter of a low wall，he would stretch himself on the warm ground， where he might for hours enjoy the light and heat，gazing before him at the grasses and sods basking in the glow．

He was glad in that light；it gave him a safe home-like feeling， such as he remembered long ago when his mother held him in her arms．He thought of all he had gone through，but without either grieving or longing．He sat still and mused，wishing nothing more than that the sun might continue to shine．

“What are you about，mooning there？”cried Pluizer．“You know I do not approve of dreaming．”

Johannes looked up with absent，imploring eyes．

“Leave me alone for a little longer，”said he；“the sun is so good！”

“What can you find in the sun？”said Pluizer．“It is nothing， after all，but a big candle—sunlight or candlelight，it is all the same in the end．Look at the patches of light and shadow in the street—they are nothing more than the effect of a light which burns steadily and does not nicker．And that light is really quite a small flame shining on a quite small speck of the universe．Out there，beyond the blue，above and beneath，it is dark，—cold and dark！It is night there， now and always．”

But his words had no effect on Johannes．The calm warm sunbeams had penetrated him，bathed his whole soul—he was full of light and peace．

Pluizer carried him off to Doctor Cypher's cold house．For some time yet the sunny images floated before his brain；then they slowly faded away，and by the middle of the day all was dark again within him．

But when evening came he made his way through the town once more，the air was soft and full of the vapourous odours of the past．Only the fragrance was ten times stronger，and oppressed him in the narrow streets．But as he crossed the open square he smelt the grass and leaves from the country beyond．And overhead he saw the spring in the tranquil little clouds and the tender rose of the western sky．

The twilight shed a soft grey mist，full of delicate tints，over the town．The streets were quiet，only a grinding organ in the distance played a love-sick tune；the houses stood out black against the crimson heavens，their fantastic pinnacles and chimneys stretching up like numberless arms．

To Johannes it was as though the sun were giving him a kind smile as he shed his last beams over the great city—kind，like the smile which seals a pardon．And the warmth stroked Johannes's cheek with a caress．

Deep tenderness came over his soul，so great that he could walk no farther，but lifted up his face to the wide heavens with a deep sigh．The Spring was calling to him and he heard it．He longed to answer—to go．His heart was full of repentance and love and forgiveness．

He gazed up with longing tears flowing from his sad eyes．

“Come，Johannes！do not behave so strangely；people are staring at you！”cried Pluizer．

The long monotonous rows of houses stretched away on each side，gloomy and repulsive—an offence in the soft atmosphere，a discord in the voices of the Spring．

The folk were sitting at their doors and on the steps，to enjoy the warmth．To Johannes this was a mockery．The squalid doors stood open and the stuffy rooms within awaited their inhabitants．The organ was still grinding out its melancholy tune in the distance．“Oh，if I could but fly away—far away！To the sand-hills and the sea！”

But he must needs go home to the little garret room；and that night he could not sleep．

He could not help thinking of his father，and of the long walks he had been used to take with him，when he trotted ten yards behind， or his father traced letters for him in the sand．He thought of the spots where the violets grew under the brushwood，and of the days when he and his father had hunted for them．All the night he saw his father's face just as he had seen him in the evenings when he sat by his side in the silence and lamplight，watching him and listening to the scratching of his pen．

Every morning now he asked Pluizer when he might once more go home to his father，and see the garden and the sand-hills again．And he perceived now that he had loved his father more than Presto，or his little room，for it was of him that he asked—

“Tell me how he is，and if he is not angry with me for staying away so long．”

Pluizer shrugged his shoulders．“Even if I could tell you，what good would it do you？”

But the spring still called him，louder and louder．Night after night he dreamed of the dark green moss and the downs，and the sunbeams falling through the fine，fresh verdure．

“I can bear it no longer，”thought Johannes．“I cannot stay．”

And as he could not sleep he softly got out of bed，went to the window，and looked out on the night．He saw the drowsy，fleecy clouds slowly sailing beneath the full moon，peacefully floating in a sea of pale light．He thought of the downs far away，sleeping through the warm night；how beautiful it must be in the low woods where none of the baby leaves would be stirring，and where the air was smelling of damp moss and young birch sprouts！He fancied he could hear the rising chorus of frogs，sounding mysteriously from afar over the meadows，and the pipe of the only bird which accompanies the solemn stillness—which begins its song with such soft lament and breaks off so suddenly that the silence seems more still than before．And it called to him—everything called to him．He bowed his head on the window-sill and sobbed in his sleeve．

“I cannot，I cannot bear it！I shall die soon，if I do not get away！”

When Pluizer came to call him next day he was still sitting by the window，where he had fallen asleep with his head on his arm．

The days went by，longer and warmer，and still there was no change．But Johannes did not die，and had to bear his troubles．

One morning Doctor Cypher said to him—

“Come with me，Johannes；I have to visit a sick man．”

Doctor Cypher was well known as a learned man，and many appealed to him for help against disease and death．Johannes had already gone with him on such errands now and then．

Pluizer was unusually cheerful that morning．He would at times stand on his head，dance and leap，and play all sorts of impudent tricks．He wore a constant mysterious grin，as though he had a surprise in store for some one．Johannes dreaded him most in this mood．

Doctor Cypher was as grave as ever．

They went a long way that morning，in a train，and on foot．They went farther than Johannes had ever been before outside the town．

It was a fine hot day．Johannes，looking out from the train，saw the broad green fields fly past，with tall feathery grasses and grazing kine．He saw white butterflies flitting over the flowery land where the air quivered with the heat of the sun．

But suddenly he saw a gleam in the distance．—There lay the long undulating stretch of sand-hills．

“Now，Johannes，”said Pluizer with a grin，“now you have your wish，you see．”

Johannes，half incredulous，sat gazing at the sand-hills．They came nearer and nearer．The long ditches on each side of the railway seemed to whirl round a distant centre，and the little houses flew swiftly past and away down the road．

Then came some trees：thickly green horse-chestnut trees， covered with thousands of spikes of pink and white blossoms—dark， blue-green pines—tall，spreading lime-trees．

It was true，then，—he was going to see his sand-hills once more．The train stopped；they all three jumped out，under verdurous shade．

Here was the deep，green moss，here were the flecks of sunshine on the ground under the forest-trees—this was the fragrance of birch-buds and pine-needles．

“Is it real—is it true？”thought Johannes．“Can such happiness befall me？”

His eyes sparkled and his heart beat high．He began to believe in his happiness．He knew these trees and this soil．He had often trodden this forest-path．

They were alone here．But Johannes could not help looking round，as though some one were following him．And he fancied that between the oak boughs he caught sight of a dark figure hiding itself， as they threaded the last turns of the path．

Pluizer looked at him with mysterious cunning．Doctor Cypher hurried forward，with long strides，keeping his eyes on the ground．

At each step the way was more familiar—he knew every stone and every shrub—and suddenly Johannes started violently：he stood before his old home．

The horse-chestnut in front of the house spread the shade of its large，fingered leaves．Above him the beautiful white flowers，and thick，round mass of foliage towered high overhead．

He heard the sound of an opening door which he knew well—and he smelt the peculiar smell of his own home．He recognised the passage，the doors，everything，bit by bit—with a keen pang of lost familiarity．It was all a part of his life—of his lonely dreamy childhood．He had held council with all these things，had lived with them his own life of thoughts—to which he had admitted no human being．But now he felt himself dead，as it were，and cut off from the old house，with its rooms and passages and doorways．The severance，he knew，was irremediable，and he felt as melancholy and woeful as though he had come to visit a graveyard．If only Presto had sprung out to meet him，it would have been less dreary．But Presto，no doubt，was gone or dead．

But where was his father？

He looked back through the open door out into the sunny garden，and saw the man who，as he had fancied，was following them on the way，coming towards the house．He came nearer and nearer，and seemed to grow in stature as he approached．When he reached the door a vast cold shadow filled the entrance．Then Johannes knew him．

There was perfect silence indoors，and they went up-stairs without speaking．There was one step which always creaked under foot as Johannes knew；and now he heard it creak three times with a sound like a groan of pain．But under the fourth footstep it was like a deep sob．

Above stairs，Johannes heard moaning，as low and as regular as the slow ticking of a clock．It was a heart-rending and doleful sound．

The door of his own little room stood open；he timidly glanced in．The strange flowers on the curtains stared at him with unmeaning surprise．The clock had stopped．

They went on to the room whence the groaning came．It was his father's bedroom．The sun shone in brightly，on the green bed-curtains which were drawn close．Simon，the cat，sat on the window-sill，in the sun．There was an oppressive smell of wine and camphor；the low moaning now sounded close at hand．

Johannes heard whispering voices and carefully softened footsteps．Then the green curtains were opened．

He saw his father's face，which had so often risen before him during the last few weeks．But it was quite different．The kind，grave expression had given way to a rigid look of suffering，and his face was ashy pale，with brown shadows．The teeth showed through the parted lips，and the white of the eyes under the half-closed lids．His head lay sunk in pillows，and was lifted a little with every moaning breath，falling back wearily after each effort．

Johannes stood by the bed without stirring，staring with wide fixed eyes at the well-known features．He did not know what he thought；he dared not move a finger，he dared not take the wan old hands，which lay limp on the white linen sheet．

All about him was black，the sun and the bright room，the greenery outside and the blue air he had come in from—all the past was black—black，heavy and impenetrable．And that night he could see nothing but that pale face．He could think of nothing but the poor head which seemed so weary，and yet was lifted again and again with a groan of anguish．

But there was a change in this regular movement．The moaning ceased，the eyes slowly opened and stared about inquiringly，while the lips tried to say something．

“Good-morning，father，”whispered Johannes，looking into the seeking eyes and trembling with terror．The dim gaze rested on him， and a faint，faint smile moved the hollow cheeks；the thin clenched hand was lifted from the sheet and made a feeble movement towards Johannes，but it dropped again，powerless．

“Come，come，”said Pluizer．“No scenes here．”

“Get out of the way，Johannes，”said Doctor Cypher．“We must see what can be done．”

The Doctor began his examination，and Johannes went away from the bed-side and stood by the window，looking out at the sunlit grass and broad chestnut leaves on which large flies were sitting which shone blue in the sun．The groaning began again with the same regularity．

A blackbird was hopping among the tali grass，large red and black butterflies fluttered over the flower-beds，and from the topmost boughs of the highest trees a soft，tender cooing of wood-pigeons， fell on Johannes's ear．

In the room the moaning went on—without ceasing．He could not help listening—and it came as regularly，as inevitably as the falling drip which may drive a man mad．He watched anxiously at every interval and it always came again—as awful as the approaching footsteps of Death．

And outside，warm and rapturous delight in the sunshine reigned．Everything was basking and happy．The blades of grass thrilled and the leaves whispered for sheer gladness．High above the trees in the deep，distant blue，a heron was soaring on lazy wing．

Johannes did not understand—it was all a mystery to him．Everything was confused and dark in his soul—“How can all this exist in me at the same time？”thought he．

“Am I really myself？ Is that my father—my own father？ Mine—Johannes's？”

And it was as though a stranger spoke．

It was all a tale which he had heard．He had heard some one tell of Johannes，and of the house where he dwelt with his father from whom he had run away，and who was now dying．This was not himself—he had only heard of it all；and indeed it was a sad story，—very sad．But it had nothing to do with him．

And yet—and yet．—It was he himself，Johannes．

“I cannot understand the case，”said Doctor Cypher，pulling himself up．“It is a very mysterious attack．”

Pluizer came up to Johannes．

“Come and look，Johannes；it is a very interesting case．The Doctor knows nothing about it．”

“Leave me alone，”said Johannes，without turning round．“I cannot think．”

But Pluizer went close behind him and whispered sharply in his ear，as was his wont—

“You cannot think？ Did you fancy that you could not think？ That is a mistake．You must think．Staring out like this at the green grass and the blue sky will do no good．Windekind will not come to you．And the sick man is sinking fast；that you must have seen as clearly as we did．But what is his disorder，do you think？”

“I do not know！—I do not want to know！”

Johannes said no more，but listened to the moaning；it sounded like a gentle complaint and reproach．Doctor Cypher was taking notes in a book．At the head of the bed sat the dark figure which had followed them in；his head was bowed，his lean hand extended towards the sick man，and his hollow eyes steadfastly gazing at the clock．

That sharp whisper in his ear began again．

“Why are you so unhappy，Johannes？ You have got what you wished for．There lie the sand-hills，there is the sunshine through the verdure，there are the dancing butterflies，the singing birds．What more do you want？ Are you waiting for Windekind？ If he exists anywhere，it must be there．Why does he not come to you？ He is frightened，no doubt，by our dark friend by the bed．He always has been afraid of him．”

“Don't you see，Johannes，that it was all fancy？”

“And listen to the moaning．It is weaker than it was just now．You can hear that it will soon cease altogether．Well，and what matter？ Many folks must have groaned just so when you were at play here among the wild roses．Why do you now sit here grieving instead of going out to the sand-hills as you used to do？ Look！ Out there everything is as flowery and fragrant as if nothing had happened．Why do you care no more for all the gladness of that life？”

“First you complained and longed to be here．Now I have brought you where you yearned to be，and yet you are not content．See．I will let you go—go out into the tall grass，lie in the cool shade，let the flies hum about you，and breathe the perfume of growing herbs．You are free！Go．Find Windekind once more．”

“You will not？ Then do you now believe in me alone？ Is all I have told you true？ Am I or is Windekind the false one？”

“Listen to the moans！So short and feeble！They will soon be stilled．”

“But do not look so terrified，Johannes，the sooner it is ended， the better．There could be no long walks now，no more seeking for violets together．With whom has he wandered these two years，do you think，while you were away？ You can never ask him now．You can never know．If you had known me a little earlier you would not look so wretched now．You are a long way yet from being what you must become．Do you think that Doctor Cypher in your place would look as you do？ It would sadden him no more than it does the cat blinking there in the sunshine．And it is best so．Of what use is brooding sorrow？ Have the flowers learnt to grieve？ They do not mourn if one of them is plucked．Is not that far happier？ They know nothing，and that is why they are thus content．You have begun to know something；now you must learn everything to become happy．I alone can teach you．All，or nothing．”

“Listen to me．What is there remarkable in your father's case？ It is the death of a man—that is a common occurrence．Now do you hear the gasping？ Weaker still！It must be very near the end！”

Johannes looked at the bed in agonised fear．Simon the cat jumped down from the window-sill，stretched himself，and then，still purring，lay down on the bed by the dying man．

The poor weak head moved no longer；it lay still，sunk in the pillows，but the short，dull panting still came through the half-open mouth．It grew weaker and weaker till it was scarcely audible．

Then Death took his hollow eyes off the clock and looked at the weary head；he raised his hand．Then all was still．A grey shadow fell on the rigid features．Silence，oppressive，unbroken silence！

Johannes sat and sat，waiting．

But the regular sound was heard no more．All was still—a great， murmuring stillness．

The tension of the last hours of listening was over，and to Johannes it seemed that his soul had been let fall down into black and bottomless space．Deeper and deeper he fell．All about him grew darker and more silent．

Then he heard Pluizer's voice as if it were a long way off．

“There！That tale is told．”

“That is well，”said Doctor Cypher．“Now you can see what was wrong with him．I leave that to you．I must be off．”

Still，as if half-dreaming，Johannes saw the gleam of bright knives．

The cat set her back up．It was cold by the corpse，and she returned to the sunshine．

Johannes saw Pluizer take a knife，which he examined carefully， and then went up to the bed．

Then he shook off his lethargy．Before Pluizer could get to the bed he stood in front of him．

“What do you want？”he asked．His eyes were wide open with horror．

“We must see what he died of，”said Pluizer．

“No，”said Johannes，and his voice was as deep as a man's．

“What is the meaning of this？”said Pluizer，with a glare of rage．“Can you hinder me？ Do you not know how strong I am？”

“I will not have it，”said Johannes．He drew a deep breath and set his teeth，staring firmly at Pluizer，and put out his hand against him．

But Pluizer came nearer．Then Johannes gripped him by the wrists and struggled with him．

Pluizer was strong；he knew that；nothing had ever been able to resist him．But he did not leave go，and his will was steadfast．

The knife gleamed before his eyes；he seemed to see sparks and red flames，but he did not give in，and wrestled on．

He knew what would happen if he yielded．He knew—he had seen it before．But that which lay behind him was his father，and he would not see it now．

And while he panted and struggled，the dead body lay stretched out motionless，just as it was lying when the silence fell；the white of the eyes visible through a narrow opening，the corners of the mouth curled to a ghastly smile．Only as the two knocked against the bed in their wrestling，the head gently moved a little．

Still Johannes held his own．His breath came hard and he could not see；a blood-red mist was before his eyes—and still he stood firm．

Then gradually the resistance of those wrists grew weaker in his grasp，his muscles relaxed，his arms fell limp by his sides and his clenched hands were empty．

When he looked up Pluizer had vanished．Death sat alone by the bed and nodded to him．

“That was well done，Johannes，”said he．

“Will he come back again？”whispered Johannes．Death shook his head．

“Never．Those who have once defied him，never see him again．”

“And Windekind？ Shall I ever see Windekind again？”

The gloomy man gazed long at Johannes．His look was no longer terrible，but gentle and grave．It seemed to allure Johannes like some great deep．

“I alone can take you to Windekind．Through me alone can you find the Book．”

“Then take me too，there is no one left．Take me with you as you have taken others．I want nothing more．”But again Death shook his head．

“You love men，Johannes．You do not know it，but you have always loved them．You must grow up to be a good man．It is a very fine thing to be a good man．”

“I do not want that—take me with you．”

“You are mistaken；you do want it；you cannot help it．”

The tall dark figure became dim in Johannes's sight—it melted into a vague shape—a formless grey mist filled its place and floated away on the sunbeams．

Johannes bowed his head on the edge of the bed and mourned for the dead man．





XIV


It was long before he looked up again．The sun's rays fell aslant into the room and were glowing red，looking like straight bars of gold．

“Father，father！”whispered Johannes．

Outside，the sun filled the whole atmosphere with a cloud of glittering golden fire．Every leaf was motionless，and all was still in the solemn，holy sunshine．

A low sighing chant came down on the sun's rays；it was as though they were singing：

“Child of the Sun—Child of the Sun！”

Johannes raised his head and listened．It was in his ears，

“Child of the Sun—Child of the Sun！”

It was like Windekind's voice．No one else had ever called him so．Was it he who called him now？

But he looked at the face before him；he would listen no more．

“Poor，dear father！”he murmured．

But suddenly it sounded again close to him，on every side of him，so loud，so urgent，that he thrilled with strange excitement—

“Child of the Sun—Child of the Sun！”

Johannes rose and looked out．What radiance！What a glory of light！It flooded the leafy tree-tops，it sparkled in the grass，and danced even in the dappled shadows．The whole air was full of it， high up towards the blue sky where the first soft clouds of evening were beginning to gather．

Beyond the meadows，between the green trees and shrubs，he could see the sand-hills．They were crowned with glowing gold，and the blue of heaven hung in their dells．

There they lay，at rest，in their robe of exquisite tints．The beautiful curves of their expanse were as peace-giving as a prayer．Johannes felt once more as he had felt when Windekind had taught him to pray．

And was not that he，his slender form in its blue robe？ There in the very heart of the light—gleaming in a shimmer of gold and blue—was not that Windekind beckoning to him？

Johannes flew out into the sunshine．There he stood still for a moment．He felt the consecration of the light，and scarcely dared stir where the very leaves were so motionless．

But the figure was there，before his eyes．It was Windekind．Certainly，surely！The radiant face was turned towards him with parted lips，as if to call him．He beckoned Johannes with his right hand．In his left he held some object on high．He held it very high with the tips of his slender fingers，and it trembled and shone in his hand．

With a glad cry of joy and yearning，Johannes flew to meet the beloved vision．But it floated up and away before his eyes．With a smile on his face，and waving his hand now and then，he touched the earth，descending slowly；but then he rose again lightly and swiftly， soaring higher than the thistle-down borne by the wind．

Johannes，too，would fain float up and fly，as of yore—and as in his dreams．But the earth clung to his feet，and his tread was heavy on the grassy sod．He had to make his way with difficulty through the brushwood where the leaves caught and rustled against his clothes，and the lithe branches lashed his face．He climbed the moss-grown hillocks panting as he went．Still he went on，unwearied， and never took his eyes off the radiant vision of Windekind and the object which shone in his uplifted hand．

There he was，in the midst of the sandy downs．The wild roses of that soil were in bloom in the warm hollows，with their thousand pale yellow cups gazing up at the sun．There were many other flowers too，light-blue，yellow and purple；sultry heat lurked in the little hollows，warming the fragrant herbs；the air was full of strong aromatic scents．Johannes inhaled them as he toiled onward．He smelt the thyme and the dry reindeer-moss，which crackled under his feet．It was overpoweringly delightful．

Between him and the lovely vision he was pursuing，he saw the gaudy butterflies flitting—small ones，black and red，and the“sand-eye”as they call it—the restless little flutterer with sheeny wings of tenderest blue．Round his head buzzed golden beetles that live on the wild rose—and heavy bumble-bees buzzed from blade to blade of the scorched short grass．

How delicious it all was，how happy he could be，when he should find himself with Windekind once more！

But Windekind glided away，farther and farther，Johannes breathlessly following．The straggling，pale-leaved thorn bushes stopped his way and tore him with their spines；the grey woolly mulleins shook their tall heads as he pushed them aside in his course．He scrambled up the sandy slopes and scratched his hands with the prickly broom．

He struggled through the low birch-wood where the tall grass came up to his knees，and the water-fowl flew up from the little pools which glistened among the trees．Thick white-blossomed hawthorns mingled their perfume with that of the birches and of the mints which grew all over the marshy ground．

But presently there were no more trees，or shade，or flowers．Only weird-looking grey eryngium growing amid the parched white-blossomed broom．

On the top of the farthest knoll rested the image of Windekind．That which he held up shone blindingly．From beyond，with mysterious allurement，there came，borne on a cool breeze，the great unceasing， surging roar．It was the sea．Johannes felt that he was getting near to it，and slowly climbed the last slope．At the top he fell on his knees， gazing over the ocean．

Now he had got above the sand-hills he found himself in the midst of a ruddy glow．The evening clouds had gathered round the departing day．They surrounded the sinking sun like a vast circle of immense rocks with fringes of light．Across the sea lay a broad band of living，purple fire—a flaming sparkling path of glory leading to the gates of distant heaven．Below the sun，on which the eye could not yet rest，soft hues of blue and rose mingled together in the heart of that cave of light；and all over the expanse of sky crimson flames and streaks were glowing，and light fleeces of blood-red down，and waves of liquid fire．

Johannes gazed and waited，till the sun's disc touched the rim of the path of light which led up to him．

Then he looked down；and at the beginning of the path of light he saw the bright form he had followed．A boat，as clear and bright as crystal，floated on the fiery way．At one end of the boat stood Windekind，slender and tall，with that golden object shining in his hand．At the other end，Johannes recognised the dark figure of Death．

“Windekind！Windekind！”he cried．But as he approached the strange barque，he also saw the farther end of the path．In the midst of the radiant space，surrounded by great fiery clouds，he saw a small dark figure．It grew bigger and bigger，and a man slowly came forward，treading firmly on the surging glittering waters．

The glowing waves rose and fell under his feet，but he walked steadily onward．

He was a man pale of aspect，and his eyes were dark and deep-set：as deep as Windekind's eyes，but in his look was an infinite， gentle pity，such as Johannes had never seen in any other eyes．

“Who are you？”asked Johannes，“are you a man？”

“I am more，”was the reply．

“Are you Jesus？—are you God？”said Johannes．

“Do not speak those names！”said the figure．“They were holy and pure as priestly raiment，and precious as nourishing corn；but they are become as husks before swine，and as motley to clothe fools withal．Speak them not，for their meaning has become a delusion， and their sacredness is laughed to scorn．Those who desire to know me cast away the names and obey themselves．”

“I know Thee！I know Thee！”cried Johannes．

“It was I who made you weep for men when as yet you knew not the meaning of your tears．It was I who made you love before you understood what love was．I was with you，and you saw me not；I moved your soul and you knew me not！”

“Why have I never seen Thee till now？”

“The eyes that shall see Me must be cleared by many tears．And you must weep not for yourself alone，but for Me also；then I shall appear to you，and you will recognise Me for an old friend．”

“I know Thee！I recognised Thee．I will ever remain with Thee！”

Johannes stretched out his hand but the figure pointed to the gleaming barque which slowly drifted off up the fiery path．

“Look！”said he，“that is the way to all you have longed for．There is no other．Without those two you will never find it．Now， take your choice；there is the Great Light；there you would yourself be what you crave to know．There，”and he pointed to the shadowy East，“where men are，and their misery，there lies my way．I shall guide you there，and not the false light which you have followed．Now you know—take your choice．”

Then Johannes slowly took his eyes off Windekind's vanishing form，and put up his hands to the grave Man．And led by Him，he turned and faced the cold night wind，and made his toilsome way to the great dismal town where men are，and their misery．




Perhaps I may some day tell you more about Little Johannes；but it will not be like a fairy tale．
