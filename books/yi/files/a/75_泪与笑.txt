爱的生命


春


亲爱的，让我们一起到丘山中走一走！冰雪已消融，生命已从沉睡中苏醒，正在山谷里和坡地上信步蹒跚。快和我一道走吧！让我们跟上春姑娘的脚步，走向遥远的田野。来吧，让我们登上山顶，尽情观赏四周平原上那起伏连绵的绿色波浪。




看，春的黎明已舒展开寒冬之夜折叠起来的衣裳，桃树、苹果树将之穿在身上，艳美绝伦，颇似“吉庆之夜”(1)的新娘；葡萄园醒来了，葡萄藤相互拥抱，就像互相依偎的情侣；溪水流淌，在岩石间翩翩起舞，唱着欢乐的歌；百花在大自然心上绽放，就像海浪涌起的泡沫。

来吧，让我们饮下水仙花神杯中剩余的泪雨；让我们用鸟雀的欢歌充满我们的心灵；让我们尽情饱闻惠风送来的馨香。

让我们坐在紫罗兰藏身的那块岩石后相亲互吻。





夏


亲爱的，我们一起到田间去吧！收获的日子已经到来，太阳对大自然的炽烈之爱已使五谷成熟。快走吧，我们要赶在前头，以免鸟雀和群蚁趁我们疲惫之时，将我们田地里的成熟谷物夺走。快快采摘大地上的果实，那是心灵采摘爱情，播在我们心灵深处的种子所结出的幸福籽粒。让我们用收获的粮食堆满粮库，就像生活充满我们的情感谷仓。

快快走，我的侣伴！让我们铺青草，盖蓝天，枕上一捆柔软禾秆，消除一日疲劳，静静听赏山涧溪水夜下的低声细语畅谈。





秋


亲爱的，让我们一同走进葡萄园，榨葡萄汁，将之储入池里，就像心灵记取世代先人智慧。让我们采集干果，提取百花香精；果与花之名虽亡，种子与花香之实犹存。

让我们回住处，因为树叶已黄，随风飘飞，仿佛风神想用黄叶为夏天告别时满腹怨言而离去的花儿来做敛衣。百鸟已飞向海岸，带走了花园的生气，把寂寞孤独留给了茉莉和野菊，花园只有将剩余的泪水洒在大地。

让我们打道回府！溪水已停止流淌，泉眼已揩干欢乐的泪痕，丘山也已脱掉艳丽衣裳。亲爱的，快来看，大自然已被困神纠缠，行将用奈哈温德歌声告别人间。





冬


我的生活伴侣，靠近我些，再靠近我一些，莫让冰雪的寒气把我俩的肉体分开。火炉前，你坐在我的身边吧！火炉是冬令最可口的果实，它会给我们讲述来者的前途，因为我的双耳已听厌了风神的呻吟和人类的哭声。关好门和窗户，因为苍天的怒容会使我的精神感到痛苦，看到像失子母亲似的坐在冰层下的城市会使我的心淌血……我的终生伴侣，给灯添些油，因为它快要灭了；把灯放得靠近你一些，以便让我看到夜色写在你脸上的字迹……拿来酒壶，让我们一起畅饮，一道回忆往昔岁月。

靠近我些！心爱的，再靠近我一些！炉火已熄灭，灰烬将火遮掩……紧紧抱住我吧！油灯已熄灭，黑暗笼罩了一切……啊，陈年佳酿已使我们的眼皮沉重不堪……困倦抹过眼睑的眼睛在盯着我……趁困神还未拥抱我，你要紧紧搂住我……亲亲我！冰雪已经征服了一切，只剩下你的热吻……啊，亲爱的，沉睡的大海多么痴呆！啊，在这个世界上，清晨又是何其遥远……




————————————————————

(1) “吉庆之夜”，伊斯兰教对《古兰经》始降之夜的敬称。“盖德尔”系阿拉伯语音译，意为“前定”“定命”“高贵”，译作“高贵的夜晚”“珍贵之夜”“高贵之夜”，又称“前定之夜”或“权力之夜”。关于“盖德尔之夜”的具体日期，教法学家说法不一。以布哈里、穆斯林所辑圣训为根据的3种说法是：⑴在莱麦丹月下旬的单日之中；⑵在该月的后七天之内；⑶该月的第29夜。另外还有4种说法，其中最后一种说法是：“盖德尔之夜”一词由9个阿拉伯文字母组成，在《古兰经》第97章共出现3次，合起来为27个字母，故应为莱麦丹月的第27夜。因这一说法符合圣训精神，故被世界穆斯林所公认。伊斯兰历以日落为一天之始，而中国穆斯林习惯上沿用公历或中国的农历计日法，故常把莱麦丹月的第28夜误认为“盖德尔之夜”。





死人城里


昨天，我摆脱城市的喧嚣，出门漫步在静悄悄的原野，终于登上一座山丘，但见大自然为它穿上了至华至美的盛装。我站在丘山上，极目望去，工厂排出的烟雾凝聚而成的浓密云彩下，整座城市连同高大建筑和宏伟宫殿一览无余，尽收眼底。

我坐在那里，远远地观看人们劳作，发现他们大多是辛苦的。我试图不用心去思考人的作为，而将目光转向主的光荣宝座——原野，看见当中有一墓地，那里排列着许多大理石坟墓，周围满是苍松翠柏。

在那里，我坐在活人城与死人城之间沉思，思考着在这里进行的持续不断的斗争和永不休止的活动，而那里却是无限的沉寂与永恒的安静。这一面，充满希望与失望，而且有爱有憎，有富有穷，有信神的有不信神的；另一面，却是除了土，还是土，大自然将之翻过来，再埋下去，从中创造出植物、动物，一切都是在寂静的夜里完成的。

当我正沉湎于冥想遐思之时，忽见一群人缓步走来，走在前面的是乐队，哀乐响彻天空。那支队伍规模宏大，富贵威严，队伍里什么样的人都有，气势雄壮，浩浩荡荡。原来那是一支为一位富豪送葬的队伍。一口棺木后面跟着大队活人，哭声惊天动地，直上云霄。

队伍到达墓地，祭司们聚在一起，祈祷焚香，乐师们吹起喇叭。片刻后，演说家们争相显示口才，用最精美的言辞为死者歌功颂德。接着是诗人们朗诵诗歌，用最华丽的诗句悼念死者。所有这些仪式都在令人厌烦的冗长过程中完成。过了一会儿，众人散去，那里留下一座新墓，乃是雕刻工匠和工程师们的精心之作，四周摆放着工艺匠人们用巧手扎成的花圈。

队伍返回城里，我远远望着，依旧沉思。

夕阳西下，山岩、树木的影子渐渐变长，大自然开始脱下用光编织、剪裁的衣衫。

那时，我又看见两个男子抬着一口木棺，后面跟着一个衣衫褴褛的女人，怀里还抱着一个吃奶的婴儿，身边跟着一条狗。那条狗时而望望女人，时而瞧瞧棺材。这是一个贫苦人的葬礼：跟在后面的妻子淌着悲泪，婴儿随着母亲哭泣不止，忠实的狗紧紧跟着，与孤儿寡母一样悲伤痛苦。

这些人来到墓地，将棺材埋在墓地的一个角落里，远远离开那座大理石墓，然后带着伤心的肃静返回。那条狗却不住回头望望主人的下葬之处。我一直望着那条狗，直到人们的身影消失在树林之后。

此时，我回头朝活人城望去，心想：“那座城市属于富贵豪强。”而后又朝死人城望了望，说道：“这座城市也属于富贵豪强！主啊，穷贫弱者的安身之地又在何方？”

我说着，朝镶着金色夕阳光边的浓密彩霞望去，只听我的内心发出一种声音，说：“就在那里！”





诗人之死是生


夜幕笼罩城市上空，冰雪为城市穿上冬装，严寒迫使人们退出市场，躲藏在自己的安乐巢窝里。狂风在房舍之间呼啸悲叹，就像吊丧者站在大理石墓间哀悼死神的猎物。

在城边上，有一座简陋茅舍，柱斜梁倾，在厚厚的冰雪重压下，行将坍塌。小屋的一角，放着一张破床，床上躺着一个奄奄一息、行将就木之人。他望着那微弱的灯光，那灯头似在竭尽全力挣扎，试图征服黑暗，但终于被黑暗压倒。那还是一个正值青春妙龄的少年郎，却知道自己大限即至，就要永远地摆脱生活桎梏，等待着死神降临。他那蜡黄色的脸上闪烁着求生渴望之光，而双唇上溢出的仍是凄楚的微笑。那是一位诗人：来到世上，以用纯美言辞给人送去欢乐为本；如今，就要饿死在这富贵活人城中了。那是一个高尚的灵魂：蒙主之恩而降生，以便使生活变得更甜美；如今，人类还未报之以微笑，它就要告别我们这个世界了。他已进入人生的弥留之际，行将断气，身旁只有油灯一盏，那是他孤独寂寞之中的伙伴；还有一页页诗稿，满载着他那颗高尚灵魂的梦幻。

那位生命垂危的青年，竭尽余力，把双手举上空中，睁开疲倦的眼皮，仿佛想用最后一丝目光穿透那破烂茅舍的屋顶，观看隐藏在乌云之后的繁星，然后说：

“美丽的死神，你来吧！我的神魂想念你呀！走近我，解去我身上的物质枷锁吧！因为我拖着它已感疲惫不堪。来吧，美妙的死神，快把我从人群中解救出来吧！只因我把从天使那里听来的话翻译成了人的语言，他们便说我是异己分子。快朝我走来吧！人已经抛弃了我，把我丢入被遗忘的角落，只因为我不像人一样贪图钱财，也不使用不如我的人。甜美的死神，快到我这里来，带我走吧！我的同胞们已不需要我。让我投入你那充满爱的怀抱吧！求你吻吻我的双唇。我这双唇既未尝过母亲亲吻的滋味，也没有接触过姐妹的前额，更未亲过意中情人的嘴。亲爱的死神，快来拥抱我吧！”

这时，诗人的病榻旁边突然闪出一位女子的身影，其美远非凡人所具有，只见她身穿雪白晶莹的衣裙，手持采自天园的百合花环。她走近诗人，热情拥抱他，伸手合上他的眼帘，以便让他借灵魂的目光看着她。她吻了吻他的双唇，那充满深爱的一吻留给诗人双唇的是心满意足的微笑。

刹那之间，茅屋变得空余尘土，只有一些诗稿散落在黑暗角落。

岁月不居，时节如流，数世代飞闪而过。那座城中的居民一直沉湎于昏睡之中。当他们苏醒过来，眼睛看到知识的曙光时，他们在公共广场的中心为那位诗人建造了一座巨大塑像，并为他确定了每年的纪念日……啊，人是多么愚昧！





灵魂


……众神之主神从自身分离出一颗灵魂，且在其中创造了美。

主神给予灵魂黎明微风的清雅、田野鲜花的馨香与月光的柔和。

主神赐予灵魂欢乐一杯，并叮嘱说：“你只有当忘记过去、忽视未来之时，才能饮用它。”

主神赐予灵魂痛苦一杯，并叮嘱说：“你喝下它，才能领会生活欢快的本质。”

主神向灵魂中播撒慈爱，只要灵魂发出第一声贪得无厌的叹声，慈爱就会离开。

主神向灵魂中播撒甜美，只要灵魂吐出第一句自高自大的言语，甜美便会出走。

主神由天上降给灵魂以学识，以便引导灵魂步上真理之路。

主神注入灵魂深处以洞察力，足以看见不可见之物。

主神在灵魂深处创造一种情感，既可随幻想流动，又能与幻影同行。

主神给灵魂穿上思念之衣，那思念之衣由天使用彩虹之波编织而成。

主神又将疑惑之黑暗置入灵魂里，那疑惑之黑暗本是光明的阴影。

主神从愤怒熔炉里取火，采集起于愚昧沙漠上的风，从自私海岸上弄来沙子，又从时光脚下取来土，然后塑造成人。

主神给自己塑造的人以盲目力量：疯狂之时，大发雷霆；面对欲望，火熄烟消。

主神微笑、哭泣，感受无边无际的慈爱，将人与其灵魂结合在一起。





笑与泪


夕阳从花木繁茂的花园收起金黄色的长尾，明月升起在遥远天际，将柔和的月华洒在花园里。我坐在树下，静静观赏着天色的变化，透过树木枝条间仰望挂在瓦蓝色的天毯上的银圆似的星斗，耳里聆听着从远处山谷传来的溪水的淙淙流淌声。

鸟儿藏身在叶子浓密的树枝间，花儿合上了眼，大自然一片寂静。这时，忽然听到踏着青草的沙沙脚步声，我调转视线望去，只见一对少年男女正朝我走来。片刻后，二人坐在一棵枝繁叶茂的树下；我能看见他俩，而他俩看不见我。

那小伙子朝四周环视了一下，我听他说：“亲爱的，你就坐在我的身边，听我说吧！你微笑吧！因为你的微笑是我们未来的标志。你欢乐吧！因为岁月已在为我们而欢乐。我的心灵告诉我，你的心中有疑虑；亲爱的，对爱情心怀疑虑是一种罪过。这大片银白色月光映照下的地产很快就要归你所有，你也将成为这足以与王宫媲美宫殿的女主人。我的宝马将供你四处游览时乘骑，我的花车将载着你出入舞场、筵席。亲爱的，你就像我的宝库中的黄金那样笑吧！亲爱的，你就像我父亲的珠宝那样望着我吧！亲爱的，你听，我的心只会在你的面前倾诉衷情。等待我们的是甜蜜华年。我们将带着大量金钱，到瑞士湖畔、意大利旅游胜地、尼罗河上的宫殿附近和黎巴嫩的雪杉下，度过我们的甜蜜华年。你将见到公主和贵妇人，她们也会嫉妒你的周身华丽服饰、珠光宝气。那一切都由我提供给你，难道你不喜欢？你的微笑多么甜美！你的微笑与我命运的微笑是何其相似！”

过了一会儿，我看见他俩缓步走去，脚下踏着鲜花，就像富人的脚踏着穷人的心。

二人消失在我的视野里，而我还在思考着金钱在爱情中的地位。我想：金钱乃人为恶之本，而爱情则是幸福与光明源泉。

我一直沉浸于这种思考之中，直至看见两个人影从我面前走过，然后坐在草地上。一个是小伙子，另一个是姑娘，都来自田间农家茅舍。一阵发人沉思的寂静过后，我听到那个患肺病小伙子的谈话中夹带着沉重叹息声。他说：“亲爱的，擦擦泪！爱神想打开我们的眼界，使我们成为她的崇拜者。爱神赋予我们以忍耐品性和吃苦精神。亲爱的，擦擦眼泪！你要忍耐，因为我们早已结成崇拜爱神的同盟。为了甜蜜生活，我们宁可忍受穷困折磨、不幸苦涩和分离熬煎。我一定要与岁月搏斗，以便挣到一笔堪放你手中的金钱，足以帮助我们度过此生各个阶段。亲爱的，爱就是我们的主，会像笑纳香火那样接受我们这叹息泪水，同样也把我们应得的奖赏赠予我们。亲爱的，我要和你告别，月落乌啼之前我将离去。”

继之，我听到一种低微柔和的声音，且不住被炽热的长吁短叹声打断。那是一位温柔少女的声音，其中饱含发自少女周身的爱情之火热、分离之痛苦和忍耐之甘甜。她说：“亲爱的，再见！”

二人分手，我仍坐在那棵树下，只觉得无数只怜悯之手争相拉我，这奇妙宇宙的种种奥秘争相涌入我的脑海。

那时，我朝着沉睡的大自然望去，久久凝视，发现那里有一种横无际涯的东西：那种东西，用金钱买不到；那种东西，秋天的眼泪抹不去，冬季的痛苦折磨不死；那种东西，在瑞士的湖泊、意大利的旅游胜地找不到；那种东西，忍耐到春天复生，夏令结果。

我在那里所发现的原本就是爱情。





幻梦


在田野上，一条水晶般的小溪畔，我看见一只鸟笼，竹篾、木条加工精细，一看便知出于能工巧匠之手。笼子里的一角，有只死鸟；另一角有一水罐，但水已干；还有一个食罐，里面一粒粮食也没有。

我静静地站在那里，留心侧耳聆听，仿佛死去的鸟儿和小溪的淙淙流水声有什么训诫似的，在求良知开口说话，要向人心探询些什么。我一番思考之后，知道那只可怜的小鸟曾在干渴中与死神搏斗，而它却居于溪水旁边；它是饿死的，而它就在生命的摇篮——田野之中，就像一位富翁，因库房门紧闭，活活饿死在金山。

片刻后，我看见鸟笼突然变成一透明躯体，死鸟变为人的心脏，心上的深深伤口正在淌着鲜红鲜红的血，整个伤口酷似悲伤女人的嘴巴。

接着，我听到从伤口发出一种夹带着血滴的话音：

“我是人的心，物质的俘虏，人类世俗法律的牺牲品。在美的田野中，在生命甘泉之畔，我被人为诗人制定的法律牢笼俘获。在爱神手中的人类美德摇篮里，我孤独地死去。因为我被禁止享用那种美德和这种爱情之果。我所向往的一切，在人看来都是耻辱；我所渴望的一切，均被人判断为卑贱。

“我是人的心，被囚禁在世俗法规黑暗之中，已是衰弱不堪；我被幻想的锁链束缚，故而奄奄一息；我被遗弃在文明迷宫的角落里，已经步入死亡。然而人类一言不发，袖手笑而旁观。”

我听到了这些话语，眼见它和着鲜血由那颗带伤的心里涌出。那之后，我再也没有看到什么，也没有听到什么声音，旋即回到了现实之中。





昔与今


一位富翁漫步在自己公馆的花园里，愁闷一直紧跟着他的脚步，忧虑在他的头上打转，就像苍鹰在死神击中的死尸上空盘旋。富翁终于走到了湖边，那是一个人工湖，周边有用大理石雕成的围栏。他坐在那里，时而望望从禽兽雕像口中喷涌出来的水，那水酷似从情人脑海里涌出的思潮；时而瞧瞧他那坐落在山丘上的宫殿，那宫殿很像美人痣镶在少女的腮边。

富翁坐着，思绪联翩，往昔写下的关于他的生活的故事，一页一页地展现在他的眼前。他开始读着，禁不住泪水簌簌下落，模糊了双眼，看不到那人工湖水面；悲伤之情将神编织的往日画面重现于他的心间，止不住怨言脱口而出。他说：

“往昔，我曾在葱绿的山冈间牧羊，高高兴兴地生活，吹起我的芦笛，表达我的由衷欢乐。如今，我竟成了贪欲的俘虏，钱财把我引向钱财，钱财又把我引入醉生梦死，醉生梦死将把我带入不幸境地。往昔，我像鸟儿一样鸣啭歌唱，像蝴蝶一样款款飞舞。微风踏草头的脚步并不比我踏田野的脚步更轻。看哪，如今我却成了社会习俗的囚徒：靠穿着矫揉造作，不时出入筵宴；一切工作全为了讨好人类及其法规。我本期望我为享受人间快乐而生，然而今天，我发现自己为金钱所累，步上了一条痛苦之路，就像背驮黄金的骆驼，黄金将要置骆驼于死地。宽广的平原在哪里？唱歌的小溪何在？清新的空气在哪里？大自然的高贵何在？我的心神又在何方？我已失去了这一切，留给我的只有黄金；我喜欢黄金，而黄金却嘲笑、蔑视我。我的奴仆多了，而我的欢悦少了；我的宫殿高耸，却毁灭了我的快乐。往昔，我与游牧民的女儿同行，纯美忠贞伴着我们，纯真爱情是我们的挚友，皎洁月光为我们照明；如今，我却身陷在那么一帮女人当中：一个个伸长脖子，挤眉弄眼，借金链、饰带换取艳美，见镯子、戒指便出让皮肉。往昔，我与青年们像一群羚羊活跃在林间，一道歌唱，共享田野之乐；如今，我在众人之间，就像猛禽爪中的羔羊，走在大街被人们用讨厌的眼光盯视，被人们嫉妒的手指指点，到游览地看见的尽是高昂的头和冷酷的脸。往昔，天赋予我以勃勃生气，饱尝大自然之美；如今，这两项天福在我已完全被剥夺。往昔，我是个饱享幸福的富翁；如今，我变成了一贫如洗的穷光蛋。往昔，我与我的羊，就像仁慈的国王与其臣民；如今，我与我的金山，就像低贱的奴隶站在主人面前……我没有想到金钱会遮蔽我的心眼，将我的心灵引向愚昧深渊；我也不知道被人们视为荣誉的东西，却像地狱之火一样灼烧人心……”

富翁原地站起身来，缓步向自己的宫殿走去，不住地叹息道：“莫非这就是钱财？难道这就是神，我已成了它的祭司？莫非它就是我们用生命买来的，却不能用它换回一丝生命？我付出一堪他尔(1)黄金，谁能卖给我一个美好想法？谁能用一把珠宝换得一分钟爱情？谁能拿走我的金库，仅仅给我一只能看到美的眼睛？”

富翁来到殿门前，就像耶利米(2)望耶路撒冷城那样，朝城市望了一眼，并用手向城市指了一下，仿佛在向城市表示哀悼之意，并高声说道：“人们啊，你们走在黑暗中，坐在死神阴影下，紧追困苦，胡乱断案，倾吐蠢言，只吃芒刺，却把果和花丢进深渊……如此行动，会延续到何年何月？你们走崎岖小道，栖身废墟之间，抛弃生命乐园，如此生活将继续到何日何年？绫罗绸缎锦衣已为你们做好，你们为什么却要穿破衣烂衫？人们啊，智慧之灯行将熄灭，快给它添些油吧！流浪汉要破坏你们的葡萄园，快起来保卫它吧！盗贼偷了你们的舒适库房，你们要当心呀！”

就在那时，一个穷人站在了富翁的面前，伸手向他讨钱。富翁望着穷人，颤抖的双唇合起，紧皱的面容舒展开来，双目间闪出温和的光芒。他在湖边痛惜的往昔已经走来向他问安。于是，他走近乞丐，亲切、平等地吻了吻他，并将一把黄金递到穷人手里，怜悯之情充满话语间，说：“兄弟，你现在拿着这些金子，明天和你的伙伴一道来，把你们的钱财都拿回去吧！”穷人就像凋零的花儿雨后重新鲜灵起来，微微一笑，快步离去。

富翁进到殿堂，说道：“生活中的一切都是美的，钱财也不例外，因为它能教人警句格言：钱财如同风琴，不善弹奏者只能听到不悦耳的噪音；钱财又像爱情，令吝啬鬼死亡，让慷慨者永生。”

(2) 耶利米，犹太人，大祭司希勒家的儿子。他原为便雅悯地区拿突城的祭司，奉上帝召见之后，成为列国先知。在约雅敬、约雅斤、西底家三个犹大王朝时期，耶利米一直四处传道，说了很多预言。因他所说的预言触怒当局，一再受到迫害。犹大国王西底家第十年，因他说了西底家必被巴比伦王打败的预言，就被西底家囚禁起来。巴比伦王攻破耶路撒冷城后，却把耶利米放了出来，并送给他粮食和礼物，让他自由选择去向。相传，《圣经》中的《耶利米书》和《耶利米哀歌》为耶利米所作。





孤儿寡母


夜迅速朝黎巴嫩北部袭来，彻底征服了白昼。在过去的白天里，卡迪沙山谷周围的村子下了一场大雪，使得田野、高原变成了一张大白纸，风神在上面不住地画线条，复又不停地抹去；暴风雪向大自然发怒的天气配合，肆意嬉戏、拨弄那张白纸。

人们躲藏在自己的家里，动物隐身于自己的窝穴，一切有生息的都停止了活动，只剩下严寒、阴冷、可怕的黑暗和令人恐怖的死亡。

在那片农村中的一座孤零零的房子里，有一妇人，坐在火炉前，正在织毛衣。待在妇人身边的是她的独生子。孩子时而望望火炉，时而瞧瞧母亲那平静的面孔。那时，阴风怒号，整座房子被刮得飘摇欲坠。孩子一惊，急忙靠近母亲，以求母亲慈爱的护佑，用来抗拒天怒。母亲忙把孩子搂在怀里，连连亲吻，然后让孩子坐在自己的双膝上，并且说：“孩子，不要怕！大自然有意教训人类：面对渺小的人类，展示自己的巨大；面对人类的脆弱，表现自己的强劲。孩子，不要害怕！在漫天飘雪、密布阴云和疯狂暴风后面，还有一个圣灵，全然知道田野和丘山需要什么。在这一切后面，还有一种目光，在用同情、怜悯的眼睛望着可怜的人。不要怕，我的心肝宝贝！春天微笑、夏季大笑、秋令叹息的大自然，现在想哭，伏在土层下的生命还等着吮吸它那冷冰的眼泪。睡吧，孩子！明天醒来，你会看到天空晴朗，田野穿着雪白的外衣，就像灵魂与死神搏斗之后换上了圣洁服装。孩子，睡吧！你父亲正在永恒平台上望着我们。多好的暴风雪，正是它使我们更加思念那些不朽的灵魂。亲爱的孩子，睡吧！四月来临时，美丽的鲜花就将从这些相互剧烈搏斗的各种因素里采摘。孩子，人也如此，只有经历了痛苦的疏远、苦涩的忍耐和致命的失望之后，才能采摘到至爱的果实。我的小宝贝呀，睡觉吧！甜蜜的梦必将来到你的心灵，既不怕黑夜的阴森，亦不惧严寒的侵袭。”

孩子望着母亲，困神已经驾临他的双眼。他说：“妈妈，我的眼皮直打架，恐怕念不上祈祷词，就睡着了。”慈祥的母亲紧紧搂住他，用泪眼望着他那天使般的面容，然后说：“孩子，跟妈一道说：主，求你怜悯穷苦人！保护穷苦人免受严寒折磨，用你的手遮住穷苦人的赤身！主，请瞧瞧睡在茅屋中的孤儿们！冰雪的寒气正在损伤着他们的身体。主，听听站在大街上、正在死神和寒冷魔爪中苦苦挣扎的寡母们的呼号！主，把你的手伸进富人的心中，打开富人的眼界，让他们看看受压迫的弱者是怎样忍受着贫困与饥馑！主，怜悯在这漆黑夜下站在门外的饥饿者，把沦落异乡的流浪汉带往温暖安身处，体谅他们背井离乡之苦！主，请你顾看一下小鸟儿们，用你的右手保护惧怕肆虐狂风的树木……主，请让这一切化为现实！”

当困意拥抱孩子的心灵时，母亲将他平放在床上，用颤抖的双唇吻了吻孩子的前额，然后回到火炉旁，继续为儿子织毛衣。





美神宝座前


我从社会逃离出来，徘徊在宽广的山谷中，时而沿溪水前往，时而静听鸟儿鸣唱，终于来到一个枝叶遮天蔽日的地方，于是坐下来，开始独自沉思，自言自语。一颗干渴的心灵，认为一切可见的都是海市蜃楼，而一切不可见的却全是陈酿美酒。

当我的头脑挣脱了物质的监牢，跃入幻梦天际时，无意中回头一望，忽见一位姑娘站在我的附近。那是一位仙女，不见珠光宝气，没有华衣锦饰，只有一条葡萄藤遮盖着部分肢体，还有一个花环束着金黄色的秀发……她从我的眼神里知道我一时惊愕不已，不知如何是好。她说：“我是林地之女。你不要害怕！”她那甜美声音恢复了我部分气息。我说：“像你这样的美女，怎么住在这野兽出没的凄清山野？凭你的生命起誓，告诉我，你究竟是何许人？又从何地而来？”她坐在草地上，说道：“我是大自然的象征。我就是你的祖辈崇拜，并在巴勒贝克、艾弗加和朱拜勒为之建祭坛、神庙的那位神女。”我说：“那些神庙已经倒塌，我的祖辈尸骨也已化为净土，他们崇拜的神和宗教的遗迹仅仅留在几页书中。”她说：“有的神伴随着崇拜者的生而生存，伴随着崇拜者的死而死亡，而有的神则依靠永恒的神性长生不老。至于我的神性，则源于你无论怎样都能看到的美。美就是整个大自然。美本是山冈间牧羊人、田间农夫和漂泊在山与海之间人们幸福的起点。美是智者登上颠覆不破真理宝座的阶梯。”我的心怦怦直跳，在说着口舌不会说的话。我说：“美是一种可怕的力量。”她的双唇间绽现出鲜花般的微笑，目光中蕴含着生命的秘密。她说：“你们人类什么都怕，甚至怕你们自身。你们怕天，而天本是安全之源；你们怕大自然，而大自然本是供休息的床榻；你们惧怕众神之主，并将仇恨和愤怒全归罪于它。其实，它既不是什么仁慈怜悯，也不是别的什么。”

一阵夹带着美梦的沉寂过后，我问她：“美究竟是何物？就像人们对它的赞美和热爱各不相同一样，人们对它的解释和理会千差万别。”她说：“它对于你的心灵有一种吸引力；当你遇到它时，你会感到数双手从你的内心深处伸出，以便将之拢到你的内心深处；肉体将之视为一种考验，灵魂把它看作一种馈赠；它可使悲欢者们之间亲近、融洽、友爱；它隐藏着，你能看到它；它不为人知，你却知道它；它沉默无声，你能听到它；它是一种力量，起自你的圣洁心灵，终结在你的想象之外……”

林地之女走近我，伸出她的酥手捂住我的眼睛。当她把手移开时，我发现我独自站在山谷中。我起身回返，心灵一遍又一遍地重复着：“美，是你所看到的；你甘愿奉献，无意索取。”





茅屋与宫殿


一


夜幕垂降，富翁的公馆里灯火辉煌，仆人们站在大门口，个个身着锦衣华饰，人人胸前纽扣闪光，等待宾临客至。

乐队高奏着欢乐的迎宾曲，众贵族男女乘坐香车宝马陆续来到公馆前，男的绣金锦袍加身，女的拖着显示富贵的长裙，一个个高视阔步，洋洋得意地步入大门。

男人们站起邀女子跳舞，女人们选定舞伴，刹那之间，大厅变成了舞曲惠风拂面的乐园，百花随风起舞，翩跹摇曳，春意盎然。

夜半时分，筵席摆就，种种美味俱全，色色水果新鲜。宾主举杯把盏，畅饮玉液琼浆，直喝得个个酩酊大醉，头昏目眩，东倒西歪。

晨光初照，熬了一整夜的贵族男女，酒喝得醉意朦胧，舞跳得精疲力竭，人人无精打采，方才散伙，各自爬上软床睡去。





二


日落之后，一个身穿劳动服的男子站在一座茅屋门前。敲过门，门开启了，他走了进去。他微笑着向家人问安之后，和孩子们一起坐在火堆旁取暖。片刻后，妻子备好了晚饭，一家人围木桌而坐，大口大口吃得又香又甜。饭后，他们走去，坐在一盏油灯旁，那灯头发出的黄色微弱光箭直扫黑暗。

一更天过去，他们不声不响地站起，然后躺下，酣然进入梦乡。

黎明时分，那男子起床后，与妻儿一起吃过些许面饼和牛奶，一一亲吻家人，继之肩扛大锄走向田地。他要用自己额头上的汗水浇灌土地，收获食粮，以供养昨夜纵酒狂舞作乐的富人。

太阳升上东山，炎热之神的脚重重地踏在耕夫的头上，而那些富人仍在他们巍峨宫殿里安睡梦中。

这是人类舞台上常演不衰的悲剧；为之叫好的观众大有人在，而静心沉思者却寥若晨星。





两个婴儿


国王站在宫殿阳台上，呼唤聚集在御花园的人们，说道：“我向你们报喜，我向国家道贺！王后生下一个王子，他将传承皇家光荣门第的尊严，同时也是你们的荣耀，还将成为列祖列宗留下基业的继承人。你们欢呼吧！你们的未来就寄托在王家子孙身上。”

众人齐声欢呼，欢声直上云天，热烈庆贺王子降生，衷心祝贺他在富贵摇篮里发育，在慈爱花台上长大，日后成为掌握奴隶生杀大权的绝对统治者，以自己的力量控制弱者的命运，随便使用他们的肉体，任意毁灭他们的灵魂。因此，他们兴高采烈，喜唱欢歌，沉湎于醉态之中。




就在那座城中，当居民盛赞强者，蔑视自己，欢歌专横者的大名，而天使却为他们的渺小泣哭之时，在一个被废弃的简陋茅舍里，有一妇人躺在病榻上，火热的怀里抱着一个用破烂襁褓包裹着的婴儿。

那是一位年轻女子，岁月注定她贫困不堪；贫困便是不幸，人们置之不理。她是一位妻子，国王的暴虐夺去了她丈夫的生命。她孤身一人，那天夜里，神给她派来了一个小伙伴，缠住了她的双手，使她无暇劳作谋生。

街上人们的喧闹声静息下来，那个可怜的女人将婴儿抱在怀里，望着孩子那闪亮的双眸，痛哭不止，仿佛她想用热泪为孩子施洗。她用足以令顽石破裂的声音说：“我的心肝宝贝儿，你为什么要从灵魂世界来到人间呀？你想分担我的痛苦生活呢，还是想怜悯我的虚弱？你为什么要离开天使和广袤天园，来到这个充满不幸和屈辱的狭窄人间？我的独生儿，我只有泪水；泪水能替代奶汁将你喂饱吗？你能拿我这赤裸的双臂当衣穿吗？牲口幼崽儿能吃青草，然后在窝棚里放心过夜；小鸟儿能啄食籽粒，然后安栖枝间巢中；你呢，我的孩子，除了我的叹息和虚弱，一无所有！”

妇人将孩子紧紧搂在自己的胸口，仿佛想使二体合一。她抬眼望着上方，大声喊道：“主啊，怜悯怜悯我们吧！”

乌云散去，月亮高悬，柔和的月光透过窗子，映入茅屋，洒在两具冰冷的尸体上……





致非难者


非难我的人，不要打搅我，让我独自待上一会儿！情侣的俊美使你爱在心中，母亲的慈爱在你心里无比可靠，儿女的情感将你的神魂打动。我求你凭这一切起誓，不要管我，让我自主行事！

请让我独自行事，自由做梦。请你忍耐到明天，任凭明天对我裁决。

你曾对我提出忠告，而忠告不过是幻影，只能把心灵带往彷徨天地，引导心灵走到生命僵死如土的地方。

我有一颗微小的心，我想把它从胸中掏出来，托在掌上，仔细探究它深处的秘密。非难我的人，请你不要用你那信念的利箭伏候着它，致使它因为害怕中箭而躲进胸腔，既无暇倾出心血，也不能尽情用美和爱尽时光赋予它的义务。

太阳已经升起，夜莺、篙雀唱个不停，桃金娘、紫罗兰花香四溢。我想挣脱卧榻粘缠，随着雪白羊群前进。

非难我的人，不要对我那样严厉，不要用林中猛狮、山谷毒蛇恫吓我！因为我的神魂不知何为恐惧，不善警戒厄运来临。

非难我的人，不要管我，也不要告诫我！因为灾难打开了我的眼界，泪水洗刷了我的眼帘，痛苦教会了我用心语。

请不要提那些禁令！我的良知里就有一个法庭，会对我做出公正判决：假若我确乎无辜，它会保护我免受惩罚；如我真是罪犯，它定会让我得到报应。

看，爱的队伍已经启程，美举着爱的旗帜紧跟，青年们边走边吹奏着欢乐乐曲。

非难我的人，不要阻拦我，让我跟着他们前进！看，眼前的道路上铺满玫瑰花和香草，空气中充满着麝香的芬芳。

请把我从利禄功名的说教中解放出来！因为我的心灵不再需要那些，只是沉醉在上帝的荣光之中。

请让我免受政治、权势的纠缠！因为整个大地是我的故乡，所有人都是我的同胞。





爱情秘语


我的美人儿，你现在哪里？你在小花园里浇灌那些爱你如同婴孩恋母的花儿？还是在自己的闺房，那个你为圣洁建造了祭坛，我誓愿以灵魂和生命献祭的地方？或者你在书海徜徉，虽然你已满腹经纶，还想更多地汲取人类的智慧？

我心灵的伴侣，你在何方？你在庙堂为我祈祷，还是在田野与你钦敬和梦想的大自然亲切交谈？或者在受苦人的茅舍里，用你那甜润的心灵安慰苦心欲碎的女人，并且慷慨施予她们以思想？

你无处不在，因为你是上帝灵魂的一部分；你无时不有，因为你强健胜过光明。

你可记得我们相聚的夜晚？你的心灵之光在我们周围形成光环，爱的天使围绕着我们，我们尽情歌颂圣灵的伟业。你可记得我们同坐在树荫下的白天？浓荫遮蔽着我们，仿佛有意挡住人们的视线，就像肋骨将心的神圣秘密遮掩。你可记得我们走过的小径、斜坡？你我的手指，就像你的辫子一样，发束相互编在一起；你我头依着头，酷似你保护着我，我保护着你。你可记得你来告别的时刻？你拥抱我，亲吻我。你给我的是圣母马利亚式的一吻，我从中知道，唇与唇一旦相吻，便带来了语言难以表述的天上秘密。那一吻是双双合叹一口气的前奏；那一口气就像上帝吹入泥中的那口气，泥顿时变成了人。那一口气，先于我们到达灵魂世界，宣布你我两颗心灵的高贵，在那里一直待到我们与之相会，永不分离……之后，你亲吻我，再亲吻我，流着泪说：“肉体有说不清、道不明的志趣，往往因为世间琐事和微小目的而分别远离；灵魂则不同，总是安居爱神掌中，直至死神降临，将之带往上帝那里。亲爱的，你去吧！生活既然委派你完成什么使命，你就乖乖服从她吧！生活是位美女，她会让服从者饱饮满杯的甘甜多福河(1)水。至于我嘛，你的爱就是与我朝夕相伴的新郎；思念你，那便是经久不散的吉庆婚礼。”

我的情侣，你现在哪里？每当微风吹向你那边时，我总是让它带去我的心脏搏动声和周身的隐秘。莫非你静夜里没有入睡？或者在静观意中情郎的肖像？那肖像已不似今日的他：往昔他因在你的身旁而眉头舒展，如今痛苦已在他的额上投下了阴影；往昔他的眼睑因用你的美搽涂而神采飞扬，如今已因哭泣而枯皱不堪；往昔他的双唇因你亲吻而富有润泽，如今已因干裂而失颜。

亲爱的，你在何方？你在大海后可能听到我的呼喊和哭声，看得见我的虚弱和低贱，晓知我的耐心和坚忍？莫非天空中没有能传达一个痛苦临终人声息的灵魂？难道心灵之间没有报送一位弥留中情人苦衷的无形连线？

我的生命，你在哪里？黑暗已将我扼住，悲伤已将我压倒。只要你在空中微笑，我就能恢复精神；只要你在苍穹呼吸，我就能重得生机。

亲爱的，你在何方？你在哪里？

啊，爱情多么伟大，而我又何其渺小！

(1) 多福河，神话传说中天堂里的一条河。





罪犯


路当中坐着一个乞讨青年。那青年本来身强力壮，饥饿已使他体弱无力，于是坐在街口，伸手向行人乞讨，朝行善者求救，一遍又一遍重复着自己处境可怜，诉说着饥饿如何痛苦难忍。

夜幕垂降，他已唇干舌燥，而他的手仍然空如饥腹。这时，他站起来，用泪水模糊的双眼望着天空，在饿神的口授下说：“主啊，我到财主那里找活儿干，结果因为我衣服褴褛被赶了出来；我叩学校的大门，因为我两手空空被拒之门外；我求别人雇用我，哪怕只能糊口，说来倒霉，我竟被驱赶。最后，我只得沿街要饭。主啊，你的信徒们看见我却说：‘这小子身强力壮。即使行善也不能施予懒汉！’主啊，母亲按照你的意志生下了我，我现在正是因你的存在而活着；我以你的名义乞讨，为什么人们却不肯给我一块面饼？”

一时间，失望的青年脸色顿改，猛地站了起来，双目里闪着灰一样的光，折下干树枝做成大棒，指着城市大声喊道：“我用额头的汗水求生活而未得生活，我将用我的臂力去求生活。我以仁爱之名乞讨面包，人们听不见我的喊声，我将用邪恶之名抢夺，还要得到更多……”

几天过去了，青年为抢项链砍断了若干脖颈；他的欲念受到阻拦，便动手捣毁灵魂的圣殿。青年的财富大增，凶残也出了名，博得大盗们欢喜，百姓们闻之心惊。后来，就像国王选派自己的代理人一样，那位国王选定那个青年作为他的代表主管那座城市。

就这样，人们用自己的吝啬把一个可怜的叫花子造就成了刽子手，用自己的冷酷将一个温和的人改造成了杀人罪犯。





幸福之家


我的心在我的胸中待得疲倦了，便告别我去了幸福之家。他到了心灵崇拜的那座殿堂，站了起来，不禁感到茫然。因为他没有看到他久所想象的一切。他既没有看到力量，也没有看到金钱，更没有看到权势。他只看到一个青年——壮美，及他的女伴侣——爱娘，还有他俩的女儿——智慧。

我的心对爱娘说：“爱娘，满足在哪里？我听说它和你们一起住在这个地方。”爱娘说：“满足走了，躲到城里那个贪欲集聚的地方去了。我们不需要它。幸福不求满足，幸福是追求拥抱的一种向往。满足是一种安慰，与之相伴的是遗忘。永恒的心灵永不满足，因为他追求完美，而完美是没有止境的。”

我的心对壮美说：“壮美，让我看看女人的秘密吧！因为你满腹经纶，求你启迪开导。”壮美说：“人心，女人就是你呀；你怎样，她就怎样。女人就是我；我到哪里，她就到哪里。女人就像未经愚昧之辈扭曲的宗教，女人就像乌云未遮的圆月，女人就像没有被腐败气息纠缠的微风。”

我的心走近壮美与爱娘的女儿智慧，说道：“把智慧给我，让我把她带到人间去吧！”爱娘回答道：“你要说，她就是幸福：始于心灵最神圣的圣地，而非来自外部。”





两种死


夜阑更深，死神从上帝那里降向熟睡的城市，落在一座宣礼塔顶。它用它那明亮的目光穿透住宅墙壁，看到乘坐在幻梦翅膀上的灵魂和受困神意志制约的躯体。

月亮沉没在曦微晨光之后，城市披上一层梦幻似的薄纱，死神迈着轻轻的脚步穿行在住宅之间，终于来到一个富豪的公馆。死神抬脚进门，没有遇到任何障碍。它站在富豪床边，伸手触摸富豪的前额，富豪惊醒过来。他一看见死神的影子站在面前，惶恐万状，失声喊道：“可怕的梦魔，离我远点！凶恶的幻影，你快走开！你这个盗贼，你是怎么进来的？你这个强盗，你来干什么？我是这家主人，你给我走开！快滚开！不然，我就要喊来奴仆和守卫，将你碎尸万段！”

死神走近富豪，用惊雷似的声音说道：“我就是死神！你要注意，放尊重一些！”富豪回答道：“你现在要我怎么样？你有什么要求？我还没有结束自己的工作，你为什么就来了？你对像我这样的富豪大亨有何要求？你还是到久病的人那里去吧！你快离开我，不要让我看见你那伤人的利爪和你那毒蛇似的长发。你走吧！我讨厌看你那两个巨大的翅膀和破烂的体躯。”一阵令人烦恼的沉寂之后，富豪又说：“不，不！仁慈的死神啊，我刚才说的那些话，请你不要在意！我因害怕，一时心惶，才那样说的。你拿一斗黄金走，或者带走几个家仆的灵魂，放我一马吧……死神，我还想活下去，因为我还有没结清的账，人们欠我的钱还没有还清；海上还有我的船，尚未靠岸；地里的庄稼也还没有长成。我这里的东西随你拿，只要放过我就行。我有婢女若干，个个像晨光那样美丽，任你挑，任你选。死神呀，你听我说，我有一个独生子，我喜欢他，我的希望全寄托在他的身上，你把他带走吧！只要能把我留下，你愿意拿什么就拿什么，你可以把一切都拿走，只求你放开我！”

富翁话音未落，死神伸手堵住那个凡奴的嘴，摄取了他的灵魂，并将之交给风神带走了。

旋即，死神又走进柔弱穷苦人们居住的区域，来到一座简陋茅舍。进了门，靠近一张床，那张床上躺着一个青春少年。死神观察一番少年的文静面孔，然后伸手触摸少年的眼睛，少年醒了过来。少年见死神站在自己的身边，急忙双膝下跪，伸出胳膊，用充满钟爱和思念的声音说：“死神，美丽的死神，我就在这里。你是我梦中的真实，你是我的希望所在，请接受我的灵魂吧！我心爱的死神，把我带走吧！你是仁慈的，不要把我丢在这里。你是神的使者，你是真理的右手，不要把我丢下。我曾多少次找你而见不到你，我曾多少次呼唤你而你没听到。你现在听到我的声音了，请不要拒绝我的愿望。亲爱的死神，拥抱我吧！”

这时，死神用柔软的手指捂住少年的双唇，摄取了他的灵魂，放在自己的双翼之下。

死神在空中盘旋，望着这个世界，对着风说：“只有来自永恒世界的人，才能回到永恒世界去。”





岁月游戏场


在美的效用与爱的幻梦之间徜徉的一分钟，要比可怜弱者在把光荣献给贪婪强者中所度过的一生都要高贵。

那一分钟里，人的神格得以生发；而那一生里，人的神格总在沉睡，蒙盖着噩梦的面纱。那一分钟里，心灵得以从人的种种法规重负下解放出来；而那一生里，心灵总是被囚禁在被人冷落的高墙之后，身上戴着沉重的镣铐。那一分钟，是所罗门诗篇(1)、山中训诫(2)和法里德塔韵长诗(3)的摇篮；而那一生，则是一种捣毁巴勒贝克神庙、台德木尔王宫和巴比伦城堡的盲目力量。

心灵在为穷人权利被剥夺、为公正丧失而遗憾，在叹息中度过的一天，要比富翁在纵欲、自私中度过的一生高贵、圣洁。那一天，可以借火纯洁心灵，用光明将心照亮；而这一生，全是在黑暗中挣扎，最后被埋在土层之下。那一天，是得启悟道(4)日，是髑髅地之日，是迁徙(5)日；而这一生，则是尼禄(6)自己的生命耗在暴虐市场上的一生，是可拉(7)身在贪欲祭坛上的一生，是唐璜(8)埋在坟墓中的一生。

这就是生活：黑暗在岁月的游戏场上将之演得类似悲剧，而白昼则将之当歌唱，最后永恒世界将之作为珍宝保存起来……

和平


将树枝吹弯，把庄稼刮倒的暴风平息下来了，繁星出现，像是电闪留在天幕上的剩余碎片。田野也平静下来了，仿佛那里不曾发生过两军激战。

这时，一位娘子走进自己的卧室，跪在床上，痛哭起来。旋即，她长吁短叹，声音阵高，呼出的热气凝成了这些话语：

“主啊，把他还给我吧！我的泪已哭干，我的肝胆俱裂。圣灵啊，你让他回来吧！因为你的英明裁决远比人的禁令有力。我的忍耐力已枯竭，我已完全被悲伤压倒。求你让他摆脱残酷的战争魔爪吧！求你把他从死神的手中拯救出来吧！主啊，求你怜悯他这么一个羸弱青年，正是强者的暴力从我的手中将他夺去的。爱神啊，你战胜你的劲敌——战神吧！求你将我的爱人拯救出来，因为他也是你的儿女。死神呀，你离他远一点！让他看看我，或者把我带到他的身边去吧！”

就在这时，一个青年走进房间，但见他头裹白色绷带，上有战神书写的腥红色字样。青年走近娘子，用泪和笑向她问安，然后拉住她的手，放在自己那火热的嘴唇上，继之用饱含炽热情感和久别重逢欢乐的声音说：

“你莫惊惶！你为之泣哭落泪的人回来了！你高兴吧！和平将战争夺去的人送回到了你的身旁，也把野心家抢去的善良青年还给了你。亲爱的，擦干眼泪，尽情地欢笑吧！因为暴君压迫人民之时，就是英明领袖引导人民抗暴之时。我能活着回来，你不要觉得奇怪！因为爱神身有印记，死神见之，必迅速逃离；敌人一经识别出来，也会踏步后退。我就是爱神。你不要以为我是来自沙场的鬼魂，只是为了欣赏你的俊美和这方的安静。你不要害怕，我是真理，安然摆脱了刀山火海，以便告诉人们：爱情必定压倒战争。我是语词，由和平之人讲出，以便为你的幸福故事作序言。”

讲到这里，青年语塞，泪水簌簌下落，取代了话语。欢乐天使在简陋茅屋四周盘旋，两颗心开始重温离别时失去的幸福。

晨光初照，二人站在田间静赏大自然秀美。充满甜言蜜语的一阵寂静之后，战士望着极远的东方，对他的爱人说：“你看哪，太阳已从黑暗中升起。”





诗人


他是连接今日世界与未来世界的一环。他是供干渴心灵饱饮的甘泉。他是植于美河之畔的树，结出的成熟果子供饥饿的心餐食。他是夜莺，跳动在话语的枝条上，唱出的歌使人们周身充满文雅、温柔。他是白云，生于曙光线上，继而扩展上升，充满整个天空，然后降下甘露，供生命田野之花饱饮。他是神差的天使，教人们理会神性。他是灿烂灯光，黑暗压不倒，升斗难掩藏，爱神阿施塔特为之添油，乐神阿波罗将之点燃。

他单身一人，穿朴拙，食斯文，坐在大自然的怀抱中，一心学习创造；夜深人静之时不眠，等待灵感降临。他是一位农夫，将心的种子播撒在情感的园地，丰收的庄稼供人类收割、食用。

这就是诗人！诗人在世时不为人知；而在他辞别这个世界、返回天国之时，人们才晓得他的价值。这诗人只要求人类报之微微一笑；这诗人气息升腾，使整个天空充满活生生的美丽幻影，而人们却不肯给他一片面包，更不肯给他一个栖身之地。

人类，世界，何日何月，你们才能用荣誉为那些以鲜血灌溉大地的人建起住宅呢？人类，世界，何月何年，你们才能放弃对那些牺牲自己的华年为你们带来平安、舒适的人以冷眼相看呢？你们崇尚杀戮，敬重那些为人们戴上奴役枷锁的人，却佯装忘记了那些人：他们用光明驱逐黑暗，以便教你们如何观赏白日的光华；他们毕生挣扎在不幸魔爪中，以便让你们享受幸福甘甜。你们这样不识真伪还会继续到何日何月何年？诗人们，生命的生命，你们不顾岁月严酷，征服了岁月；你们不畏虚假芒刺，赢得了桂冠；诗人们，你们占据了人们的心田，这占据无始无终。





死之美献给M.E.H.


死亡


让我安睡吧！我的心已沉醉于爱情。

让我长眠吧！我的魂已享尽日夜照应。

请在我的灵床周围点起蜡烛，燃起香，将玫瑰花和水仙花瓣儿撒在我的身上！把麝香粉撒在我的头上，把香水洒在我的脚下，然后仔细观看死神之手在我的前额上留下了什么字样。

让我深深睡在困神的怀抱！因为久醒，我的眼帘痛感疲劳。

请弹起琴弦！让银丝弦声响在我的耳边。

请吹起芦笛！用那甜润的笛声，在我那行将跳动的心脏周围织上一层薄纱。

请唱起轻歌！用那神妙的词句为我的情感铺床，然后仔细观察我的两眼里闪出的希望之光。

伙伴们，擦去眼泪，抬起头来！就像黎明到来之时，鲜花昂起花冠，向着太阳开放。你们看，死神的新娘像光柱一样站在我的灵床与天空之间……请你们屏着呼吸，留心细听，片刻之后，便能和我一道听到她那雪白翅膀的沙沙扇动声。

同胞们，你们来同我告别吧！用微微笑唇将我的前额亲吻。用你们的眼睑亲吻我的双唇，再用你们双唇将我的眼睑亲吻。

让儿童们靠近我的灵床，请他们用那柔嫩的玫瑰色手指摸一摸我的脖颈。让老年人靠近我的灵床为我祝福，用他们那枯萎、僵硬的手将我的前额抚摩。让本地的姑娘们靠近我，看看我眼中的上帝影像，听听永恒世界的歌声回音与我的呼吸声共鸣同响。





永别


呵！我的身已到山顶，我的魂已遨游在自由无束的太空。

同胞们，我已走得老远老远。我的视线被遮挡，丘山壮景已荫翳在雾霭后面。千道峡谷被寂静汪洋淹没，万条蹊径已被遗忘之掌尽抹。草原、森林、道路笑隐在无数幻影之后；那幻影，白的像春云，黄的似阳光，红的如晚霞。

大海波涛的歌声变得微弱，溪水的吟唱消失在田间，人间的喧嚣哑然静止。此时此刻，我的耳际中只有与灵魂嗜好相协调的永恒之歌。





安息


请取下我身上的麻织殓衣，用茉莉、百合花瓣为我裹体。

请从象牙棺材里抬出我的遗骸，让之平躺在柑橘、柠檬花枕上。同胞们，不要哭我，而要高唱青春欢乐之歌。田家女啊，请不要流泪，而要吟诵收获、榨汁季节的二重韵诗。

请你们不要用呻吟、叹息掩盖我的胸膛，而要用你们的手指画上友情与欢乐的符号和标记。

请你们不要用念咒和占卦打扰太空的休息，而要让你们的心与我一道盛赞永恒的真谛。

你们不要穿黑衣哀悼我，而要披白纱与我同乐。

你们不要伤心地谈论我一去不复返，而要闭上眼睛，就会看见我今天、明天和以后都在你们中间。

请你们让我躺在青枝绿叶上，肩抬着我，缓步把我送到空旷荒野那没有人烟的地方。

请你们不要把我抬到墓地，因为大理石会干扰我安息，尸骨、骷髅的咯咯碰撞声也会夺走我长眠的静谧。

请把我送到松柏林里，找块地方，为我掘个坟坑；在那里，紫罗兰与白头翁同长共生。

请把我的坟坑挖得深一些，以免洪水将我的尸骨卷入山谷。

请把我的坟坑挖得宽一点，好让夜的幻影来访时坐在我的身边。

请脱去这些衣服，让我赤身裸体入土。请你们将我放下，要慢要轻，让我安睡在母亲的怀中。

请你们用松软的土将我掩埋，每把土里都要掺入百合、茉莉和长寿花种，让群芳吸收我遗体的养分，在我的墓上生长；开出的花儿，在空气里散发我心底的馨香；高高扬起头，将我灵魂里的秘密诉与太阳；随微风摇曳，让过路人记起我过去的爱好和梦想。

同胞们，现在请离开我，让我独自留在这里！你们走吧，迈步要轻，就像寂静行走在空谷之中。

让我独自留在这里，请你们静静地散去，就像巴旦杏、苹果树花飘飞散落在四月的春风中。

请你们回家去吧！在那里，你们会发现死神也不能够从我和你们身上取走的东西。

离开这个地方吧！你们所要的东西已经远远地远远地离开了这个世界……





组歌


一支歌


我的心灵深处有一支歌，不喜以语词为衣；那支歌居于我的心坎，不愿随墨水注入笔端；那支歌像透明的封皮，包着我的情感，不肯像口水涌上舌尖。

我怕能媒细尘将之玷污，怎可将它吟唱？因它习惯于安居我心灵中，担忧它难耐人耳粗糙，我又能唱给谁听？

假如你看看我的眼睛，便会看到那支歌幻影的幻影；倘若你触摸我的手指，就能感到那支歌在抖动。

我的作品能显示那支歌，就像湖面能够倒影星斗之光；我的泪水能揭示那支歌，如同气温将露珠挥洒之时，露珠便将玫瑰花的秘密揭露。

寂静将那支歌张扬，喧嚣又将之掩盖；幻梦令其复出，苏醒又将之隐藏。

众人哪，那是一支爱之歌，哪位以撒(1)能唱？哪位大卫能歌？

它比茉莉花的气味芳香，哪个喉咙能将之抵抗？它比童贞女的秘密严实，哪根琴弦敢将之揭示？

谁能把大海咆哮与夜莺啼鸣结合在一起？谁能将暴风与孩子叹息合二而一？哪个人会唱神的歌曲？





浪之歌


我与海岸是一对情侣，爱情使我俩接近，风又把我俩分离。我来自蓝色晚霞之后，以便让我的银沫与它那金沙结合，用我的唾液把我的心冷却。

黎明时分，我对着情人的耳朵将爱法朗诵，情人把我紧紧搂在怀中；夜幕降临，我把思恋祷词对他唱吟，他便与我热烈亲吻。

我执拗、急躁；我的情侣却既有耐心，且又坚韧。

涨潮时，我拥抱情人；落潮时，我拜倒在情人脚下。

多少次，当美人鱼游出深水，坐在岩石山观赏繁星，我围着她们跳舞；多少次，我听情人与美女们诉说爱情之苦时，我与之一道叹息；多少次，岩石悔恨自己僵死不能动，我与它逗笑，而它从无笑意；多少次，我从海底窃得珍珠，将之赠送给天下美女！

夜阑更深，人们与困神拥抱进入梦乡，而我却不眠，时而歌唱，时而叹息。我多可怜！

熬夜使我精疲力竭，容颜憔悴。但是，我是热恋者；爱情的真谛是长醒不睡。





雨之歌


我是银线，上帝将我从高空抛下。大自然将我笑纳，并用我去装点千谷万壑。

我是美丽的珍珠，散落在阿施塔特女神的王冠上；晨光的女儿将我偷去，用我将田野镶嵌。

我哭，而山川在微笑；我谦恭下士，而花儿却高昂起头。云彩与田地本是一对情侣，我是二者之间的救急使者；我自天而降，医好那位的病疾，解除这位的干渴。

雷声和闪剑是我到来的先兆，七色彩虹宣布我的行程终结。世间生活亦如此：始终盛怒的物质脚下，终于平静的死神手上。

我从湖心升腾，在能媒的翅膀上行走。当我看见美丽的园林时，便立即降下，亲吻白花芳唇，拥抱绿叶青枝。

寂静之时，我便用自己纤细柔软的手指敲击窗玻璃；那敲击声构成乐曲，敏感的心灵方能通晓领会。

空气的高温将我生下，我则解除空气的高温。正如女子，她从男子那里汲取力量，又用这力量去征服男子。

我是大海的叹息，我是天空的泪水，我是田野的微笑。爱情亦如此：它是情感大海的一声叹息，思想天空的一滴泪水，心灵田野的一丝微笑。





美之歌


我是爱情的向导，我是精神的醇酒，我是心灵的美食。我是一朵玫瑰花，日出东方，我开启心扉，少女将我摘下，又把我亲吻，然后把我挂在她的胸前。

我是幸福之家，我是欢乐源泉，我是宽舒起点。我是窈窕淑女粉唇上的轻柔微笑，小伙子看见我会忘怀疲劳，他的生活会变成美梦的舞台。

我能启迪诗人的心灵，我能给画家引路，我能给音乐家当导师。

我是婴儿眼中的亮光，慈母见之，急忙跪拜、祈祷，把上帝赞扬。

我将夏娃的胴体展示在亚当面前，致使亚当对之顶礼膜拜；我在所罗门面前饰作他那意中人的苗条身段，致使所罗门变成了哲学家和诗人。

我向海伦(2)微微一笑，特洛伊(3)化为一片废墟；我为克娄巴特拉(4)戴上王冠，尼罗河谷充满温馨和睦。

我像世代，今天建设，明日毁坏；我是上帝，使万物生，亦令之死。

我比紫罗兰花的感叹轻柔，我比暴风强烈。

众人们，我就是真理。我是真理，这一点你们最该知晓。





幸福之歌


人是我的情郎，我是人的情伴。我思慕他，他迷恋我。可是，呜呼！我和他之间冒出了个第三者，和我一道爱上了他，使我面临不幸，也给他造成了痛苦和折磨。那暴虐的第三者名叫“物欲”：我们走到哪里，它跟我们到哪里；它像毒蛇一样，分开了情郎和我。

我去旷野寻情郎，在树下，到湖旁，不见他的身影；因为物欲引诱他，将他带往城市，去会狐朋狗友，搞腐化堕落，终于自投不幸之中。

我去知识学院、智慧殿堂，不见他的身影；因为那以尘土为衣的物欲把他带到自私自利堡垒中去了。那是醉生梦死居住之地。

我去知足之地寻情郎，不见他的身影；因为我的情敌把他禁锢在贪得无厌的洞穴里。

黎明时分，东方欲晓，我呼唤情郎，他听不到我的喊声；因为留恋过去的困意使他的眼皮感到沉重。夜深人静，百花入眠，我与他嬉戏，而他却不理睬我；因为向往未来的迷恋占据了他的心。情郎爱我，他在自己的作品中寻觅我；其实，他只能在上帝的作品里找到我。他想到用弱者的骷髅建在金银中的荣誉宫殿去与我相会，而我只在情感溪畔那神灵建造的朴素茅舍里才与他见面。他想在暴君、杀人犯面前和我亲吻，而我只有在纯洁花丛间幽会时，才准许他吻我的双唇。他希望计谋为我俩做媒，而我只求纯洁、美好的工作当我们之间的媒婆。

我的情郎从我的情敌——物质——那里学会了呐喊和喧嚣，而我将教他自己的眼里流出求怜的泪水，发出要求充足东西的叹息。我的情郎属于我，我也属于他。

花之歌


我是大自然说出的话语；旋即大自然又将之收回，隐藏在自己的心里，然后又将其讲出。我是星斗，由蓝色帐篷落到绿地毯上。

我是冬天孕育的各种成分的女儿；春天将我生下，夏天将我养大，秋天哄我入睡。

我是情侣俩的礼物，我是婚礼上的花环，我是生者送给死者的最后一件赠礼。

清晨，我与微风合作宣布光明的到来；夜晚，我与百鸟一同与光明告别。

我在平原上摇曳晃动，将平原装饰一新；我在风中呼吸，使空气里充满芳香。我睡下时，夜晚的无数只眼睛盯着我；我醒时，用白日的单只眼睛观察。

我喝着露酒，听着鸟唱歌，和着青草的掌声起舞。我经常向高空仰望，以便看到光明，不看自己的幻影。这就是人尚未学到的哲理。





人之歌


你们原是死的，而他以生命赋予你们，然后使你们死亡，然后使你们复活；然后你们要被召归于他。

——《古兰经》(1)

我自古存在，依然故我，我将存在到永久，我的存在无终结。

我曾在无穷太空遨游；我曾在幻想世界翱翔；我接近过最高光明圈；看哪，如今却成了物质的囚徒。

我听过孔夫子的教诲；我聆听过婆罗门的哲理；我曾在菩提树下坐在达摩的身旁；呵，我现在正与愚昧和不信神搏斗。耶和华面谕摩西时，我在何烈山上；在约旦河旁，我亲眼目睹过拿撒勒人耶稣显示奇迹；在麦地那城，我听过阿拉伯人的先知训教；呵，我现在却成了迷惑、彷徨的俘虏。我看到过巴比伦的强盛；我见识过埃及的辉煌；我领略过希腊的壮丽；但我仍看到柔弱、屈辱和卑微显现在那所有功业里。我曾与艾尼·杜尔的妖术师、亚述的祭司、巴勒斯坦的先知们坐在一起，但我仍然歌颂真理。我背诵过来自印度的格言；我熟读过源自阿拉伯半岛居民心中的诗歌；我领略过由马格里布人情感凝结而成的音乐；但我是视而不见的瞎子，听而不闻的聋子。我承受过贪婪征服者的残暴；我遭受过专制统治者的欺凌和暴虐之徒的奴役；但我仍然有力量与日月抗争。

我看到和听到所有这些时，我还是个孩童；我将要看到和听到青年时代及其未来的功业；我将要步入老年，臻于完美，归于上帝。我自古存在，依然故我，我将存在到永久，我的存在无终结。

诗人之声


一


力量能够把种子播在我的心田，我来收割，集起谷穗，将之一捆一抱地送给饥馑者。

灵魂使这微小的葡萄树成活，我则把它结出的葡萄榨成汁，送给干渴人喝。苍天给这盏灯添满了油，我则将之点上，放在我家窗口，为夜下行人把路照亮。我之所以做这些事情是因为我依靠此而活着。假若白昼禁止我的行动，黑夜又将我的双手捆起，我则求一死。因为这最适合于一个被其民族抛弃的先知和在乡亲中被视为异乡人的诗人。

人们像暴风一样喧嚣，我则静静地叹息。因为我发现暴风的怒吼会消失，会被世代的汪洋大海吞噬，而叹息则与上帝一起永存。

人们贪恋冰雪一样寒冷的物质，我则追求爱的火焰，将之抱在怀里，让其吞食我的肋骨，销蚀我的五脏六腑。因为我熟知物质能使人毫无痛苦地死去，而爱情则用痛苦使人复活。

人类分种族、群体，分属国家、地域。我视自我在某一地区为异乡人，独立于任何一个民族。整个地球都是我的祖国，所有人类家庭都是我的亲戚。因为我发现人已十分弱小，还要自我分割，岂不是自视卑贱！地球本来就很狭窄，还要分成若干王国，岂不是过分愚昧！

人类竞相捣毁灵魂殿堂，合力建造肉体学院，我却独自站在痛惜的立场上。但是，我留心聆听，听到我的内心里有一种希望声音在说：“就像爱情用痛苦使人复活那样，愚昧能教人认识知识之路。痛苦和愚昧能化为巨大快乐和完整知识。因为永恒的智慧在太阳上没有创造任何虚假东西。”





二


我思恋我的祖国，因为她美丽无比；我热爱我的国民，因为他们无比不幸。但是，如果我的民族在被他们称为“爱国主义”的策动下，起来向临国发动进攻，掠夺人家的财产，残杀他们的男子，使儿童变为孤儿，令女子变成寡妇，使土地饮其男儿的血，令野兽食其青年的肉，那时，我便会厌恶我的祖国和国民。

我赞美我的故乡，我思念我在那里成长起来的国家。但是，如果有路人经过那里，要求在那家园投宿，向乡亲们要口面饼，竟会遭到拒绝，并被驱赶而去，那么，我的赞美就将为哀叹所代替，我的思念也将被遗忘淹没，我会自言自语：“连一块面饼都舍不得给饥馑者，连一张床都不肯给投宿者的家园，应该就地捣毁，夷为废墟！”

我爱故乡，更爱祖国，尤爱祖国的大地。我全身心热爱大地，因为大地是人性的摇篮，而人性则是大地上的神性灵魂。神圣的人性正是大地上的神性灵魂。那人性站在废墟之间，赤条条的身上只盖着破布片，凹陷的两腮挂着热泪，高声呼唤着自己的儿女们，使整个广宇充满了呻吟声和哭叫声，而她的儿女们根本不去理她的喊声，只顾唱着宗派主义的歌，更无视她的簌簌泪流，只顾磨自己的利剑。那人性独自坐着，向民众大声求救，而民众听不见。假如有人能听到她的喊声，定会回应，继而走近她，为她擦拭眼泪，安慰她惨遭不幸。这时，民众会说：“不要管她！眼泪只能打动弱者。”

人性是大地上的神性灵魂。那神性行走在各国之间，畅谈博爱，指出人生之路，而人们却嘲弄神性的言论和教诲。往昔，那里虽然耶稣听了神性，人们却把他钉在十字架上；苏格拉底(1)听了神性，人们让他服毒杀身；如今，许多人听了神性，而且当着众人大谈耶稣、苏格拉底和神性，人们再没有能力杀死他们，但却讥笑他们说：“讥笑比杀人更厉害、更苦涩。”

耶路撒冷未能杀死耶稣，耶稣活到永远；雅典未能处死苏格拉底，苏格拉底得到永生。

讥笑也不能征服听从人性呼唤、紧跟神性脚步的人们，他们也将活到永远，得到永生。





三


你是我的兄弟，我俩都是至尊圣灵之子。你像我一样，因为我俩同是肉体的囚徒，而上帝铸造两个肉体时用的是同一块泥。你是我生活道理上的伙伴，正是你帮助我认识隐藏在乌云之后的真理的本体。

你是人，我的兄弟，我爱你！你可以随意对我加以评说。因为明天将为你做裁判，你的话语将在公正裁决面前成为明显而确凿的证据。

你可以随意从我这里拿东西，因为我所占据的钱财，其中一部分属于你；我所占有的房地产，是我为我的贪心占有的，你可以享用其中一部分，如果一部分能让你满意。

你可以随意处置我，但是，你却没有能力触犯我的真理；你可以放我的血，焚烧我的肉体，但你不能使我的心灵痛苦，更不能使之死去；你只管给我的手脚戴上镣铐，将我下到黑暗的牢狱，但你却不能俘虏我的思想，因为它自由得像微风，徜徉、遨游在无边无沿的天宇。

你是我的兄弟，我爱你。

你在你的清真寺里做礼拜，我爱你；你在你的庙堂里顶礼膜拜，我爱你；你在你的教堂里做祈祷，我爱你。你和我本是一种宗教之子，那宗教便是灵魂。这种宗教各分支的领袖都是指向心灵完美的神性之手上相互连在一起的手指。

我爱你，爱你那源自一般智力的真理。那真理，我现在看不见它，因为我盲目；但我认为它是神圣的，因为它是心灵的作品。那真理将与我的真理在未来的世界里相遇，像花的气息一样相互结合在一起，变成一个完整永恒真理，与爱与美一道永存长在。

我爱你，因为我见你在暴虐强者面前那样软弱；我爱你，因为我见你在贪婪的富豪门前那样穷困。因此，我为你哭泣落泪。我透过眼泪，看见你在公正的怀抱中，公正在向着你微笑，蔑视压迫你的那些人……你是我的兄弟，我爱你。





四


你是我的兄弟，我爱你。既然如此，你为什么与我为敌？

你为什么来到我的国家，试图说服我讨好那些教长们？君不见，那些教长用你的话语求取荣光，借你的辛苦获得欢乐。你为什么丢下你的妻儿，去到遥远的地方，为将军们送死？君不见，那些将军们想用你的鲜血买高官，借你母亲的悲痛换取尊荣。难道说一个人杀自己的兄弟能算高尚？如果是那样，我们就为该隐(2)雕像，为亚那(3)颂歌。

喂，我的兄弟，他们说：“维护自我是大自然的根本法则。”但是，我认为野心家的特点在于：

首先使你甘心牺牲自我，以便达到制服你的兄弟们的目的。他们说：“要想生存，必须侵犯他人权利。”我则说：“维护他们的权利，那才是人类至尊至美行为。”我还要说：“假若我的存在必须使他人死亡，那么，死亡对我来说最甜最美。假如没有人让我体面、光彩、清白地死去，我会亲手把自己提前送往永恒世界。”

我的兄弟呀，自私自利会导致盲目竞争，竞争会产生沙文主义，沙文主义会生出专利。所有这些都是争执和奴役生成的原因。心灵主张智慧和正义压倒愚昧和邪恶，而坚决反对那种拿金属锻造长矛、利剑，用武力推行愚昧和邪恶的权势。正是那种权势毁坏了巴比伦，毁坏了耶路撒冷的支柱，摧毁了罗马的建筑。正是那种权势造就了刽子手、杀人犯，而人们却把他们描述为“伟人”，作家依然在宣扬他们的名字，书籍也把他们的战斗记录、保存下来；与此同时，当他们用鲜血染红地面时，大地也不得不把他们背在自己的背上……兄弟呀，究竟是什么东西使你迷恋于欺骗你的东西，依附于危害你的人呢？真正的权势是维护公正普遍自然法则的智慧。假若一种权势能够处决杀人犯，将盗贼打入监牢，自己却又去进攻临国，乱杀成千无辜，掠夺上万财富，那么，这种权势的正义何在呢？对那些让杀人犯去惩处杀人者，让盗贼去处罚小偷的宗派主义者，又该作何评论呢？

你是我的兄弟，我爱你。爱是最高形式的正义。假若我对你的爱在各方面有失公正，那么，我就是穿着爱的漂亮外衣，以掩饰自私自利丑陋面目的诈骗犯。

据传，耶稣被出卖后，首先被带到亚那那里。





跋语


我的心灵是我的挚友：每当日月灾难沉重，总给我以安慰；生活艰辛之时，与我共分忧愁。谁不做自己心灵的朋友，便成为人们的敌人；谁不能自我安慰，便会绝望而死。因为生命源自人的内心，而非来自周围外界。

我来到人间，有话要说；我将要把它讲出。假若在我讲出它之前，死神就把我召去，那么，来日会将之讲出。来日是不会把隐藏的秘密留在没有穷尽的书中的。

我来到人间靠爱的荣耀和美的光明活着；看哪，我现在活着，人们无法使我远离生活。

如果人们挖去我的双眼，我会留心听赏爱之歌和美之曲；如果人们塞住我的两耳，我会因为接触到融合着情侣气息和美的芳香的能媒而感到快乐。

我来到人间，是为了大家，也依靠大家。我今天孤自做的事情，未来会当众宣布；我现在单口说的话语，来日会用许多口舌道出。

流浪者





流浪者


我在路口上遇见他。他除了身上穿的和手杖，一无所有，面带沉痛神情。相互问好之后，我说：“请到我家做客吧！”

他接受了邀请……

我的妻儿在门口迎接我们，他对我们微笑，他们欢迎他的到来。

宾主一道围桌坐下，全家人为见到这么一位蒙着神秘色彩、心意寂静无声的稀客感到高兴。

晚饭后，我们围火而坐，我开始问他的游历。

那夜及次日，他给我们讲了许多故事。但我现在向你讲的，只不过是他痛苦经历中的要点，虽然他讲的时候是那样心平气和。这些故事是他路途风尘的痕迹，也是他承受艰难困苦的部分收获。

三天之后，客人离去之时，我们不觉客人已经离去，只是觉得他是我们当中的一员，仍在家外的花园里，还没有走进家门。





衣服


一天，美神与丑神相遇在海岸，各自问对方：“你游泳吗？”

二神脱下衣服，下海搏风斗浪。仅过片刻，丑神回到岸边，穿起美神的衣服走了。

美神离水回到岸上时，发现自己的衣服不翼而飞，只好穿起丑神的衣服离去。

自那天起，男男女女在辨别美神与丑神时，每每认错。

然而有那么一些人，他们曾仔细端详过美神的容貌；尽管美神身着丑神的衣裳，依然能认出美神。还有一些人，能够认出丑神；虽然丑神穿着美神的衣裳，却瞒不过他们的眼睛。





兀鹰与云雀


兀鹰与云雀相遇在高山的一块岩石上。云雀说：“早晨好，先生！”兀鹰居高临下，望了望云雀，低声说：“你早！”

云雀说：“但愿你万事如意，先生！”

兀鹰答：“是啊，我们都万事如意。可是，难道你不晓得我是百鸟之王？我不跟你说话，你是不能对我说话的。”

云雀说：“我看我们是一家人。”

兀鹰蔑视地望着云雀，说：“谁告诉你，我和你是一家人？”

云雀：“关于这件事，我想提醒你一下：我能像你一样高飞，我还会唱歌，给大地上人们的心中送去欢乐；而你则不能为他们带来任何欢乐和享受。”

兀鹰生气了：“欢乐和享受！你这个装腔作势的小东西！我能一啄将你撕个稀巴烂。你不过才有我的爪子那么大。”

云雀一跃跳到兀鹰背上，开始啄它的羽毛。兀鹰烦恼难忍，展翅高飞摩天，想把云雀甩离脊背。然而未能如愿。最后，它还是落到了起飞的那块岩石上，云雀依旧踩在它的背上。兀鹰气急败坏，怨天尤人。

这时，一只小乌龟走近兀鹰，见其怪状，大笑不止，笑得仰面朝天。

兀鹰瞧不起小龟，说：“你这个行动迟缓、弯腰驼背、永远附着地面的小东西！你笑什么？”

小龟回答：“因为我看你变成了一匹马，一只小鸟骑着你，小鸟都比你强。”

兀鹰说：“去你的！这是家庭问题，是我与云雀姐妹之间的事，外人休插嘴！”





情歌


有一次，一位诗人写了一首情歌，高妙自不待言。他抄写了几份，分寄给好友与相识，其中男女均有。他也给一位姑娘寄去了一份；他与她只见过一面，她住在山后。

过了一两天，姑娘差人送来一封信。信中云：“请允许我向你吐露真情，我深深被你写的情歌所打动。请你现在就来，来见我的父母，面商订婚事宜。”

诗人即刻复信。信云：“朋友，那不过是发自诗人心中的情歌，每个男子都可以唱给每位姑娘听。”

姑娘又写来一封信。信中说：“花言巧语骗人的坏蛋！从今到死，我将因你而憎恨所有的诗人！”





泪与笑


黄昏时分，鬣狗与鳄鱼相遇在尼罗河畔，双方停下脚步，互相道好问安。

鬣狗说：“先生，你的日子过得怎样呀？”

鳄鱼回答道：“过得很糟糕啊！我有时因痛苦烦恼而伤心落泪，可周围的人们总是说：‘这不过是鳄鱼的眼泪。’这使我悲伤到不能描述的地步。”

鬣狗说：“别只谈自己的痛苦和烦恼，你也得想想我的处境呀，哪怕是暂短一刻呢！我看到世界上的壮观美景，心里就充满欢乐，就像白昼那样眉开眼笑。然而林中人却说：‘这不过是鬣狗的欢笑。’”





集市上


一次，一位农村姑娘来到集市上。姑娘貌美超凡，面似玫瑰、百合，发若金色晚霞，唇含黎明微笑。

这位罕有的人间仙女，便被小伙子们盯上了，纷纷围拢上去，千方百计接近她。这个想跟她跳舞，那个想请她品尝糕点，多想上去吻一吻她的面颊，而且他们另有打算。

但是，姑娘自感受损，又惊又恼，认为那些青年行为不端，怒而斥责他们，气极之下，还抽了一两个人的耳光，然后目不斜视地离去。

天色已晚，姑娘在回家的路上，暗暗自言：“真讨厌！那些男子多没礼貌，道德多么败坏，简直叫人无法忍受。”

一年过去了，这位漂亮姑娘一直想念着集市和那些小伙子们。之后，她又一次来到集市上，依然面似玫瑰、百合，发若金色晚霞，唇含黎明微笑。

然而小伙子们一看见她，便纷纷躲开。姑娘孤孤零零度过了一天，没有一个人接近她。傍晚时分，姑娘回到家里，暗暗自语：“那些小伙子真没礼貌，讨厌至极，真令人无法忍受！”





两位储妃(1)


舍瓦基斯城内住着一位储君，城里的男男女女、老老少少都爱戴他，就连地里的牲口也熟悉他，走来向他问安，见他来高高兴兴。

然而人们却说其正妻储妃并不爱他，甚至有人认为储妃恨其丈夫。

一天，邻邦的储妃前来拜访舍瓦基斯储妃，两位储妃坐下谈话，各自说起自己的丈夫。

舍瓦基斯储妃激动地说：“我真羡慕你和你的丈夫生活得那样幸福，虽然你们结婚已那么多年。我呢，讨厌我的丈夫，因为他不属于我一个人。说真的，我是最不幸的女人。”

来访的储妃眷恋凝视着主人，说：“朋友，其实你是爱你的丈夫的。是的，你仍对他怀有未释放出来的激情，这就像花园里的泉水，正是女人的生命所在。可是，我和我的丈夫呢，我们之间没有任何感情，只是互相默不作声地忍受着对方，而你和人们却认为那是幸福。”

闪电


一个风雨交加的日子，一位基督教主教正在大教堂时，一位非基督教妇女走来，站在主教面前，问：“我不是基督教徒，我能免遭地狱火烧吗？”

主教审视着妇女，回答道：“不能！只有那些受过洗礼，灵魂得到净洁的人才能免受地狱火烧。”

主教正说话时，一道闪电自天劈下，继之雷声轰鸣，教堂起火，烧着了教堂的各个角落。

城里的人迅速赶来，救出了那位妇女，而主教却被火神吞食了。





修士和禽兽


葱绿的丘山上，住着一位修道士。他灵魂纯洁，心地善良。各种飞禽走兽常成双结对地来看望他；他与它们谈天论地，它们高高兴兴，侧耳聆听；它们一心接近他，和他一直待到日落，只有他为它们祈祷吉祥之后，方才打发它们走，目送它们飞上天空，步入丛林。

一天黄昏，修士正谈论爱情之时，一只豹子抬起头来，对修士说：“先生既然给我们谈论爱情，那么，就请谈谈你的情侣，她现在哪里？”

修士说：“我没有生活伴侣。”

这时众禽兽一声惊呼，彼此交头接耳：“他根本不懂什么情和爱，怎么能向我们谈论爱情呢？”众禽兽怀着蔑视的心情，相继悄然离去，只剩下修道士孤身一人。

那天晚上，修士躺在席子上，两眼望着地，双手捶胸，痛哭不止。





先知和少年


一天，先知沙利亚在花园遇到一少年。少年看见他，急忙跑过来，说：“早安，先生！”先知还礼道：“先生，你早！”接着又说：“只有你一个人？”

少年高兴地笑着说：“我甩掉我的保姆好长时间了，她以为我在这篱笆外面。可是，你没看见我在这儿吗？”之后，他注视着先知的面孔，说：“你也是一个人，你是怎么应付你的保姆的呢？”

先知答道：“我们之间的情况不同。其实，我大半时间是甩不掉她的；可是现在，我来到了这座花园，而她还在篱笆墙外找我呢！”

少年拍手叫道：“那么，你和我一样，也是个走失的人啦！走失的人不挺好吗？”然后问：“你是何人？”

“人们都称呼我先知沙利亚。你呢？”先知说，“告诉我，你是何许人？”

少年说：“我就是我自己。我的保姆在找我，而她不晓得我在哪里。”

先知凝视着天空，说：“我也只能暂时逃离保姆一下。可她会在外面找到我的。”

少年说：“我知道我的保姆也将在外面找到我。”

这时，传来一个女人呼叫少年名的喊声，少年说：“你看，我对你说她会找到我的。”

这时，外面也传来一种声音：“沙利亚，你在哪里？”

先知说：“孩子，你瞧，他们也发现我了。”

沙利亚仰面朝天，回答道：“我在这里。”





珍珠


河蚌对邻居的一只河蚌说：“我的肚子痛得厉害，里面有个又重又圆的东西。我带着它遭多大磨难呀！”

邻居开心自得地回答道：“赞美苍天和大海。我没有任何疼痛感，里里外外，健壮安康。”

这时一只水蟹经过，听到两只河蚌交谈，对那只健壮安康的河蚌说：“是啊，你的确健壮安康。可是，使你邻居感到肚子疼的那种东西，是一颗美妙无比的珍珠。”





肉体与灵魂


一男一女相互依偎在春光明媚的窗前。女子说：“我看你，仪表堂堂、家财万贯，你永远有那么大的吸引力。”

男子说：“我爱你。你是一种美妙思想，高远莫测；你是我梦中之歌！”

然而女子扭过脸去，愤怒地躲开他，说：“先生，我希望你从现在起离开我。我不是什么思想，也不是你梦中的什么东西。我是个女人，我希望你想着我。我是妻子，我是尚未出生孩子的母亲。”二人分手了……

男子自言自语：“又一个梦想破灭了，化成了云雾。”

女子独自苦思冥想：“男人为什么要把我化为云雾、梦想呢？”





国王


萨迪格王国的人民包围了王宫，群众愤而高呼反对国王的口号。国王从王宫台阶上走下来，一手托着王冠，一手提着权杖，众人看见国王，霎时一片肃静。国王站在众人面前，说：“朋友们！从现在起，你们不再是我的臣民。看哪，我这就把王冠和权杖交给你们。我想成为你们当中的一员。我不过是个普通人，但我想作为一个人，与你们一道劳动，共同努力，使我们的命运更加美好。不需要国王了！让我们到田野和葡萄园去，手挽手地劳动吧！我期望你们给我指出应该去的田地或葡萄园。现在，你们每一个人都是国王！”

人们大惊，鸦雀无声。被他们看作灾难根源的国王，如今交出王冠和权杖，成了他们当中的一个百姓。

之后各自散去，国王跟着一个人走向田间。

然而萨迪格王国的情况并未改善，愤怒云雾依旧笼罩着王国的天空和大地，人们又聚集在广场高呼口号，要求有个人统治他们，掌管他们的事务，老少异口同声喊道：“我们要国王！”

他们找到国王，发现他正在田间劳动，便把王冠和权杖交给他，说：“现在，你果断、公正地统治我们吧！”

国王说：“我将真的果断地统治你们，我也将请天地之神佐助我公正地统治你们。”

之后，男男女女前来控告一贵族虐待他们，把他们当成奴隶。国王下令把那贵族传唤来，对他说：“人的生命在上帝的天平上都是等重的。你既然不知道如何称量在你的田园中劳作的这些人的生命，那么，我就把你赶出去，你应该永远离开这个王国。”

第二天，一些人来告居住在山丘后的一个心地残忍、弄得当地贫穷不堪的女爵。国王下令立即把她带来，判之以流放，并且说：“这些人耕种我们的土地，看管我们的葡萄园，我们吃着他们烤的面包，喝着他们酿造的酒，他们比我们高贵。既然你连这一点也不晓得，那么，你应该离开这块土地，远离这个王国。”

又有男女来控告主教，说主教强迫他们搬运、雕刻石头，建造教堂，分文不付；他们明知主教金银满库，而他们却很忍饥挨饿，食不果腹。

国王下令把主教带来，对他说：“你胸前挂的这十字架，意味着用生命换生命，而你却一味索取，从不付出。因此，你当离开王国，永远不得回返。”

就这样，整整过了一个月，每天都有男男女女前来诉说他们肩上沉重的负担；与此同时，每天都有一个或更多压迫者被驱逐出境。

萨迪格国民惊喜，心中充满欢乐。

一天，老老少少将王宫包围起来，呼唤国王，国王一手托着王冠，一手提着权杖来到他们中间。

国王说：“现在你们还有什么要求？我把你们所希望我拿来的东西再还给你们吧！”

人们高声呼喊：“不，不！你是我们公正的好国王，是你清除了我们国土上的毒蛇、豺狼。我们来为你歌功颂德。王冠的威严属于你，权杖的光荣属于你。”

国王答道：“不，不是我！不是我！你们自己才是国王。当你们认为我懦弱无能、不善治理之时，你们也是不善治理的弱者。如今，国家走上了正道，因为那是你们的意愿。我呢，不过是你们大家头脑中的一种理想，我存在于你们的工作之中，并不是一个叫统治者的人。被统治者会发现自己在统治自己。”

国王带着自己的王冠和权杖回到宫中，老老少少们各自高高兴兴回家而去。

每个人都认为自己是一手托着王冠，一手提着权杖的国王。





沙滩上


一个人对另一个人说：“海水涨潮时，我用鞋尖在沙滩上写了一行字；人们至今仍驻足读之，唯恐日后被什么抹去。”

另一个人说：“我也在沙滩上写了一行字，但那是在退潮之时，海浪一来便将之抹去了，请告诉我，你写的是什么？”

前者回答道：“我写的是：‘我是存在者’。你写的呢？”

“我写的是：‘我是沧海一滴水’。”





三件礼物


布什拉城有位仁慈王子，颇得臣民爱戴。

该城还住着一个光棍儿，一贫如洗，习惯骂人，经常摇唇鼓舌，诽谤中伤那位王子。

王子知道此事，但始终忍在心中，未动声色。

终于，王子想出一个制服那个光棍儿的办法：一个冬夜，王子派仆役给光棍儿送去一袋面粉、一盒肥皂和一块糖砖。

仆役敲过门，说：“王子给你送来了礼物，作为纪念，以示关心。”

光棍儿引以自豪，欣赏不已，满以为这是王子对他的敬重，高傲自得地走到主教那里，把王子送礼之事细细告之，并且说：“难道你看不到王子在如何讨我的喜欢吗？”

然而主教却说：“哦，好一个聪慧的王子，而你又是多么缺少智慧呀！王子在用暗示说话：面粉填充你那辘辘饥肠，肥皂洗涤你那心灵污垢，糖砖甜润你的苦涩口舌。”

自那日起，光棍儿深感自惭形秽，更加憎恶王子。这憎恶也波及点破王子意图的主教。

然而自此沉默下来，没再中伤王子一句……





和平与战争


一天，三只狗在太阳下晒暖谈天。

第一只狗做梦似的说：“真奇怪，我们今天像狗一样生活，想想我们当年在海底、地上，甚至天空中旅行的方便，再想想为狗提供享乐的那些发明创造，我们的耳、鼻和眼多有福气！”

第二只狗说：“我最关心艺术。我们月下的吠叫声比我们的前辈更富有节奏感；看我们自己落在水中的影子，会发现我们的容貌比昨天更洁净，更清晰。”

第三只狗走上来，说：“然而最使我留恋、最勾我心魂的，还是狗王国中的相互谅解！”

这时，三只狗环视四周，发现一打狗者向它们走来，多么可怕！

三只狗一跃而起，胡乱向大街上窜去。逃跑时，第三只狗喊道：“求上帝保佑，你们逃命吧！文明正在后面追捕我们。”





舞女


一次，一位舞女及其乐队来到拜尔卡沙国王子的宫廷，侍卫们热情迎接。舞女和着四弦琴、芦笛、洋琴的乐声，在王子面前翩跹起舞。

舞女先后跳了火焰舞、剑矛舞、星星舞、太空舞，最后又跳了风中之花舞。

其后，舞女在王子面前停下舞步，向王子躬身施礼。王子令其走近自己，对她说：“美丽的女子，幸福与欢乐的女儿，你的舞艺是从哪儿学来的？你怎么能够把大自然的各种因素融汇在你的舞蹈及其节奏韵律当中去呢？”

女子再次向王子行躬身礼，然后答道：“我不知道如何回答殿下的问话。我只知道一点，那就是：哲学家的灵魂居其头脑，诗人的灵魂居其心中，歌手的灵魂居其喉咙，而舞女的灵魂则宿其周身。”





两个守护神


一天夜里，两个天神相遇在城门，相互问候之后，开始交谈。

一个天神说：“这些日子里，你在干什么？分派给你的任务是什么？

另一个天神答：“分派给我看守一个罪人，他生活在山谷里，犯了大罪，滑到了危险的边缘。请允许我向你肯定，这是一项重大任务，我将付出极大辛苦。”

第一个天神说：“那很简单，我很了解罪人，不止一次看守过他们。我最近被分派看守一名心地善良的圣徒，他生活在树枝搭成的凉棚下，远避人们，离群索居。我要肯定地对你说，这才是一项极其困难而细致的差事呢！”

第二个天神说：“这纯粹是欺诈！守护圣徒怎么会比看守罪人更难？”

第一个天神回答：“说我欺诈，岂有此理！我说的全是真话。我看你才是个诈骗犯！”

两个天神争吵起来，起初动口，最后终于拳脚相见。

双方正打得不可开交，天神王来了，停下脚步，问道：“为何争斗？什么事情使你俩打了起来？难道你们不知道守护神之间打架是不成体统的，尤其是在城门口？告诉我，你俩之间的分歧何在？”

两个天神同时开口，都称自己的工作比同伴的困难，理应得到对自己功德更大的认可。

天神王摇了摇头，认真思索起来……

最后说：“二位兄弟，我现在不能说你俩之间谁应得到更大荣誉和更大报偿。我既然有权指挥你们，而且你俩都坚持对方的工作比自己的轻松，那么，我给你俩调换一下工作。为了太平无事，确保看守任务完成，并使各自满意，现在你俩就各自承担原来委派给对方的任务去吧！”

两个天神即去执行天神王的命令。然而二天神边走边不时回头怒目望望天神王，暗自说：“这帮天神王！他们把我们这些守护神的生活弄得一天不如一天。”

天神王站在那里，自言自语道：“其实，我们应该小心谨慎，留神看守这些守护神。”





雕像


山上住着一个人，他有一尊雕像，系古代某位大师所作。他把雕像丢在门前的地上，压根儿不去看它一眼。

一天，一个城里人路经山上人家门。那城里人见多识广，一看见雕像，便对主人表示想买下来。

主人笑道：“这是一块没人要的脏石头，你还想给它找个买主？”

城里人说：“我给你一块银币买下它。”

山上人又惊又喜。

雕像被一头大象驮运到城里。几个月之后，山上人进城，正游逛大街时，见一个店铺门口人山人海，其中一个人大声喊叫道：“都来瞧，都来看，这里有一尊世间完美的雕像，仅仅两个银币，便可一睹雕塑大师的传世杰作。”

这时，山上人付了两个银币，走进店铺观看……原来那就是他以一块银币卖出的那尊雕像！





交换


一次，穷诗人与愚富翁相遇在交叉路口。二人之间有一长段谈话，所说的话无不流露着愤怒、厌恶情绪。

这时路神经过，手往二人肩上一搭，奇迹发生了：各自的财产转入了对方的手中。

二人各自离去。更奇异的是：诗人睁眼一看，发现自己手里抓的是流动的干沙子；而富翁一合眼，便觉得自己的心里尽是流动的乌云！





爱与憎


一女人对一男子说：“我爱你。”男子说：“我值得你爱的在我心中。”

女人问：“难道你不爱我？”男子久久注视着女人，没有作声。

这时女人高声喊叫：“我憎恶你。”男子说：“我值得你憎恶的也在我心中。”





梦


一个人睡觉时做了个梦，醒后去找占卜师，求其为之圆梦。

占卜师对那个人说：“你把醒时做的梦给我带来，我将给你圆之；至于你睡时所做的梦，则是我的学问和想象力不可及的。”





疯子


那是在疯人医院的花园里发生的事：我碰见一位面色憔悴、容貌俊美、令人觉怪的青年。

我在他身边的凳子上坐下来，问他：“你为什么在这里呢？”

他吃惊地望着我，说：“这么问不合适，但我还是回答你：我父亲要我变成他的复制品，我的叔父也想要我变成他那样的人，我母亲希望我成为她那位名扬四海的父亲那样，我姐姐则打算让我成为她的海员丈夫那样应该效仿的完美典型，而我的哥哥却说我应该成为他那样的出色的运动健将。

“还有，我的老师们，从哲学博士到音乐教师、逻辑大师，每个人都决心使我成为他们在镜中的影像那样。

“因此，我来到了这个地方。我发现这个地方能还健康给我，至少我能够成为我自己。”

之后，他突然把脸转向我，说：“请告诉我，你也是被别人的劝告和教诲送到这里来的吗？”

我回答：“不！我是来参观的。”

他说：“那么，你是住在墙那边的疯人医院里的一个人了。”





青蛙


夏令的一天，一只青蛙对其伙伴说：“我真担心我们夜晚唱歌会搅得岸上那家人不得安宁。”

伙伴回答：“是啊！可是，难道你不觉得他们白天唠唠叨叨也扰乱了我们的宁静吗？”

青蛙说：“人所共知，我们在夜里唱得太多，而且过分多了！”

伙伴说：“他们白天里高声喧闹，而且过分嘈杂，这也是我们所共知的。”

青蛙说：“牛蛙的咆哮声弄得四邻不得安宁，我们有什么可说的呢？”

伙伴说：“是啊！那些来这岸边的政治家、牧师和学者喧闹不休，声音震天动地，既无音韵，亦无节奏，那你该说什么呢？”

青蛙说：“真的！我们总要比这些人好些吧！让我们夜间安静一些，把歌保留在我们的心中，虽然月亮企盼着我们的歌喉，星宿期待着我们的和声。我们至少该沉默一夜或两夜，甚至连续三夜吧！”

伙伴说：“很好！我同意。我们将看到我们的好心会带来什么结果。”

一夜过去，青蛙未鸣。第二夜、第三夜，也未听见青蛙的叫声。

更奇怪的事情发生了：第三天，住在湖岸边那家的多嘴多舌的女人下来吃早饭，高声对丈夫说：“一连两夜，我都没有尝到睡觉的滋味。我只有听着蛙鸣，才能进入梦乡。我三夜没有听见蛙鸣，准是发生了什么意外事。我因失眠，都快要发疯了啦！”

青蛙听到这话，把脸转向伙伴，使了眼色，说：“我们沉默得几乎要疯了，不是吗？”

伙伴回答道：“是啊！夜下沉默，对我们来说真是个沉重的负担。我现在已经明白，为了给那些用喧闹声填充空虚的人创造欢乐，我们没有必要中断我们的歌声。”

那天夜里，月亮终于盼到了青蛙的歌喉，星宿等来了青蛙的和声。





法律与立法


古时候，有位伟大的国王。这位国王英明，想为臣民制定法律。国王召来选自一千个部落的千位贤人，要他们制定在幅员辽阔的王国通行之法。

书写在羊皮纸上的千条法律被呈于国王面前，国王过目后痛哭流涕，因其不曾知道，王国之内，罪恶形式竟达千种。

之后，国王召来书记官，亲自口授法律，双唇含着微笑，最后法律成文仅仅七条。

千位贤人怒而离去，带着他们制定的千条法律回到部落中。每一个部落都开始采用千位贤人制定的法律。

因此，直到今天，他们有千条法律。

那是个大国家，境内有千座监狱，这些监狱中充满触犯法律的男男女女。

那的确是个大国。然而国民都是千位立法者和一位英明的国王的后裔。





昨天·今天·明天


我对我的朋友说：“你看，她靠在他的手臂上；昨天，她还靠在我的手臂上呢。”

朋友说：“明天，她就靠在我的手臂上了。”

我说：“你看，她依偎在他的身旁；而昨天，她还紧紧倚着我坐呢。”

朋友说：“明天，她将坐在我的身旁了。”

我说：“你看哪，她正喝他杯中的酒；而昨天，她还和我同杯共饮呢。”

朋友说：“明天，她就会同我共饮一杯酒了。”

我说：“你看，她含情脉脉地注视着他；昨天，她也是这样凝视着我。”

朋友说：“明天，她也将这样望着我。”

我说：“瞧呀，她正在他的耳边低吟情歌；昨天，她还对着我的耳朵说悄悄话。”

朋友说：“明天，她就要对我唱情歌了。”

我说：“瞧呀，她在拥抱他；昨天，她还拥抱我呢。”

朋友说：“明天，她就要拥抱我了。”

我说：“一个多么奇怪的女人！”

朋友说：“她像生命，人人可以占有；她像死神，要征服所有的人；她像永恒世界，将接纳所有生灵。”





哲学家与鞋匠


一次，一位哲学家穿着破鞋来到修鞋铺，对鞋匠说：“我想修修这双鞋子。”

鞋匠说：“我现在正修别人的鞋，而且还有些鞋子也非修不可，然后才能轮到修你的鞋。不过，你可以把鞋放在这里，今天先穿这双鞋走，等明天我给你修好后再来取你的鞋子。”

哲学家生气了，说：“我从不穿别人的鞋子。”

鞋匠说：“那好！你真是一位哲学家，不能把你的脚放在别人的鞋子里吗？这条街头上还有一个鞋匠，比我更了解哲学家，你到他那里去修鞋吧！”





建桥者


在安塔基亚的阿绥河入口处，有一座桥，将城市的两个部分连接起来。建桥用的条石，都是安塔基亚的骡子从山里驮来的。

桥建成后，一个桥墩上用希腊文和阿拉伯文刻着：“该桥为安条克二世(1)国王所建。”

人们过河都打这座连接城市两部分的桥上经过。

一天傍晚，来了一个青年人，有的人认为他疯到了一定程度。这个小疯子来到刻着字的桥墩旁，用碳黑将原来的字抹掉，另写上：“该桥所用之石，皆由骡背自山间驮来；往来过桥者，均骑在该建桥者——安塔基亚骡——背上。”

人们看过青年写的字，有的笑，有的惊，也有人说：“嗬，是的！我们知道那是何人写的，不就是那个‘小疯子’吗？”

然而一头骡子笑着对另一头骡子说：“那是我们驮的石头，难道你不记得？虽然如此，但至今仍有人说该桥为安条克二世国王所建。”




————————————————————

(1) 安条克二世（公元前286-前246），叙利亚塞琉王国国王。公元前261年即位。





扎德土地


旅行者在扎德的一条路上遇到一村夫，便指着大片土地问道：“这片土地不就是当年艾赫拉姆国王大胜敌人的战场吗？”

村夫道：“这里从未当过战场。这里原是宏伟的扎德城，因失火化为灰烬，但现在变成了肥沃良田。不是吗？”

二人分手，各奔东西。

走了不到半里路，旅行者遇到另一个人，指着田地又问：“这里当年有座宏伟的扎德城？”

那人说：“这里根本没建过城，倒是曾有一座修道院，已毁于南夷人之手。”

过了一会儿，旅行者在同一条路上遇到三个人，指着宽广的土地问：“这里原先真有一座修道院吗？”

那个人回答：“这附近从来没有什么修道院。不过，我们的父辈、祖辈曾经告诉我们，这片土地曾落过一颗大流星。”

旅行者继续往前走，心中暗暗叫怪。之后遇见一位老者，问过安好，说：“老先生，我在这条路上遇到三个当地人，向每个人打听过这片土地的历史，但说法各不相同，都向我讲了一个别人没讲过的故事。”

老人家抬起头来，回答道：“朋友，这几个人说的都是事实。但是，我们当中很少有人能把一个个不同的事实串连起来，讲出整个历史事实。”





金腰带


一天，两个到有高柱的萨拉米斯城去的人相遇，于是结伴同行。中午时分，二人行至一条大河边，河上无桥，要么游过河，要么改走生路绕行。

一个对另一个说：“我们游过去吧！这河并不宽，不必去吃绕行生路之苦。”

说完，二人跳下水去。

时隔不久，其中一个人便失去了平衡，被水流冲向远方，不能把握自己的方向，而他是识水性、熟知水道的。与此同时，另一个人不曾下过水，却沿着直线游过了河，很快站在对岸上。他见同伴正与水流搏斗，便再次跳下水中，把同伴安全拖上岸来。

险些被水流送命的人问：“你说你是不会游泳的，怎么这样信心十足地游过了河呢？”

对方说：“朋友，难道你没看见我这条金腰带吗？这里面装满金币，是我一整年辛辛苦苦劳动所得，全是为妻儿挣的。正是这条金腰带的价值将我浮过河来，以便回到妻儿身边；我游泳时，妻儿都在我的肩头。”

二人一起继续向萨拉米斯城走去。





红土


大树对男子说：“我的根深扎红土之中，我将把果实献给你。”

男子对大树说：“你我何其相似！我的根也深扎在红土里。红土给予你力量，以便让你把果实献给我；红土也教我接受你的奉献，同时表示谢恩。”





圆月


一轮圆月升起，光华普照城郭，城里的狗都对着月亮吠叫不止。然而有一条狗没叫。它厉声对同伴说：“你们的吠叫声既不能起死回生，也不能让月亮落地。”

霎时间，所有的狗中止吠叫，全城陷入吓人的寂静之中。但对大家说话的那条狗，为了寂静，一直持续吠叫了一整夜。





出家的先知


过去有两位出家的先知，每月三次离开禅房进城，在集市上号召人们助人为乐，分担他人重担。先知口齿伶俐，能言善辩，颇能说服人，因此名声远扬，国人皆知。

一天，三个男子来到先知的禅房，先知热情接待他们。他们对先知说：“你一直劝告人们施舍行善，互助协作，意在教育那些富有的人周济穷人。我们怀疑你的名声给你带来大批财富。如今，我们饥馑难忍，就请你给我们一些钱财吧！”

先知答道：“朋友们，我仅有这张床、这床被子和这把壶；如果你们需要，就拿去吧！我既无银，又无金。”

三个人蔑视地望了望先知，走在后面的一个人，在门口站了片刻，说：“噢，你在撒谎，你在行骗！你张口劝教别人，却从不以身作则！”





陈年佳酿


从前有个富翁，常炫耀自己的地窖中所藏的醇酒。窖中藏有一坛陈年佳酿，除了富翁，谁也不晓得他要保存到何时，更不知道他要派什么用场。

一位行政官来访，富翁对其来访表示感谢，心想：“不能为一个造访的行政官开这坛陈年佳酿。”

本地主教来访，富翁心想：“不能打开这坛陈年佳酿；因为主教不知其价值，更闻不出佳酿醇香。”

王子来访，富翁与之共进晚餐。富翁心想：“这是帝王之酒，王子安配饮之！”

直到侄子完婚时，富翁还在想：“不能！这些客人都不配喝这样的陈年佳酿。”

年复一年，许多年过去了，富翁暴卒，像一粒普通的种子或橡子被埋在土里。

下葬那天，窖藏之酒全被取出，其中包括那坛陈年佳酿，邻近农民开怀畅饮，谁也不曾留意那坛陈年老酒的年龄。

在饮者眼里，那坛陈年佳酿与其他酒一样，不过都是酒罢了。





两首长诗


许多世纪之前，两位诗人在雅典大街上相遇，彼此都为这邂逅而高兴。

第一位诗人问第二位诗人：“你近来写了些什么？这些日子里，你的灵感如何？”

第二位诗人回答道：“我刚完成一首长诗大作，堪称希腊有史以来最伟大的诗歌。它是至高宙斯神的独白！”

说着，从大袍里掏出一卷羊皮纸，“你瞧，就在这里，我随身带着呢！我很乐意给你朗诵一下。来，我们到那棵白杨树荫下坐坐吧！”

他开始朗诵自己的诗，那诗很长很长。

第一位诗人温和、礼貌地说：“这是一首长诗，必将流传百世，令后代称颂。”

第二位诗人从容不迫地问：“你最近有何新作？”

第一位诗人答道：“我写得很少，只有八行小诗，是为纪念原在花园里嬉戏的少年而作的。”接着，他朗诵了一遍。

第二位诗人说：“不太好，也不太坏。”

二人各自走去。

两千年后的今天，第一位诗人的那八行诗，已浮于民口，众人们无不赞而咏诵。

而那首长诗，虽然传了下来，却始终藏在图书馆和学者书斋里；人们提到它，却没人喜欢，无人咏诵。





罗丝太太


一次，三人遥见远处的绿色山丘上有一座孤零零的白房子，其中一个说：“那是罗丝太太的家。她是一位老巫婆。”

第二个人说：“你错了！罗丝太太是位漂亮的女子，整日沉醉于自己的梦乡。”

第三个人说：“你俩皆错！罗丝太太是这一大片土地的主人，靠吮吸在这里干活的奴隶们的血生活。”

他们边走边争论。

来到岔路口，遇见一位老者，其中一个人问道：“你能将住在丘上那座白房子里的罗丝太太的情况告诉我们吗？”

老者抬起头，微微一笑，说：“我现年九旬，我还是小时候听说过罗丝太太。罗丝太太去世已八十年了，那座房子是空的，只有猫头鹰在里面鸣叫；人们有时也说，那里面还住着别的什么东西。”





鼠与猫


一天傍晚，诗人遇见一位农夫。诗人冷漠，农夫腼腆；尽管如此，二人还是谈了起来。

农夫说：“我最近听到了一个小故事，让我讲给你听。一只老鼠落入捕鼠器中，正当它津津有味地吃着里面放的奶酪时，一只猫站在了它的身边。老鼠起初周身战栗，但立刻知道自己在捕鼠器里是平安无事的。

“猫说：‘朋友，你已吃过最后一餐。’

“老鼠回答道：‘我只有一次生命，那么，也将只有一次死亡。可是，你呢？听说你有九次生命，岂非意味着你有九次死亡吗？’”

农夫说到这里，望着诗人，问：“这不是个离奇的故事吗？”

诗人没有答话，而是走远之后，心想：“一点不错，我们肯定有九次生命，活命九生；我们应该有九次死亡，死亡九次。也许待在捕鼠器里，像农夫一样生活，仅用一块奶酪当最后一餐，还是只有一生更好些。那样，我们不就与沙漠和丛林里的猛兽是亲属了吗？”





诅咒


一次，一位老水手对我说：“三十年前，那个水手抢走了我的女儿，带着我的女儿逃跑了。我开始在心里诅咒他俩，因为在这个世界上，除了我的女儿，我不喜欢任何人。

“时隔不久，那个水手连同船一起沉入大海，我可爱的女儿也与他一起葬身海底。

“现在，你瞧瞧我这个害死了小伙子和姑娘的人！是我诅咒毁灭了他俩。如今我将要入土，求上帝宽恕我的罪过。”

老者这样说，然而他的语调里却充满自负与豪迈，好像仍在炫耀他那咒语的力量。





石榴


先前，一个人的果园里有许多石榴树。几乎每年秋天，他总把石榴放在银盘里，置于门外，盘上插着标牌，亲手写上：“欢迎自取，分文不收。”

然而打银盘旁经过的人，谁都不拿石榴。

他经过一番思考，当下一个秋天来临，没把满盛石榴的银盘置于户外，只是插了一个标牌，上写：“我有上等石榴，以高出其他石榴的价格出售。”

临近的男男女女，都来争相抢购。





一神与多神


基拉菲斯城的一位诡辩家，坐在神庙的台阶上，向人们宣讲神有多位。人们心想：“我们知道，这些神不是和我们生活在一起，与我们形影相伴吗？”

没过多久，另一个人站在城市广场上，对人们说：“根本不存在什么神。”听了这个好消息，许多人感到高兴，因为他们惧怕神灵。

一天，来了一个肌肉发达、口齿伶俐的人，说：“只有一位神灵。”人们心中恐惶，害怕一神判决胜过多神判决。

同一季节，又来了一个人，对人们说：“神有三位，居高风上，如同一体，他们有一位慈祥的母亲，心胸宽广，同时是他们的同伴，又是他们的姐妹。”

众人愁容消退，一个个心中暗想：“虽然三位一体，但判断我们的缺点时，肯定意见不一。此外，他们的母亲心地善良，定会站在我们一边，为我们的弱点辩护。”

直到今天，基拉菲斯城的居民们仍在围绕是多神、无神、三位一体、神之慈母等问题无休无止地争论。





如此聋妻


富翁有一位年轻的妻子，但却耳聋。

一日清晨，夫妻正吃早饭，妻子说：“我昨天逛了市场，那里货色齐全、琳琅满目；大马士革绸袍、印度头巾、波斯项链、也门手镯……应有尽有，看来都是商队刚刚运到城里来的。现在，你看看我，破衣褴缕，成何样子，我还是知名富翁的妻子呢！我要你给我买些漂亮的东西。”

正在呷吮咖啡的丈夫，立即回答：“我亲爱的！没什么不可以的，你去市场，买下自己想买的称心如意的东西就是了。”

聋妻说：“不，不，你就会说不！难道命中注定我身着破衣出现在男朋女友面前，让家人替我害羞，让人们讥笑你这个阔佬儿？”

丈夫说：“我没说‘不’。你可以去市场买下全城最漂亮、最讲究的首饰和其他装饰品。”

妻子又误解了丈夫的话，回答道：“你是富人当中最吝啬的守财奴，你就是不想让我打扮得漂漂亮亮，而人家的贵妇人三三五五逛花园时，个个珠光宝气，人人艳妆浓抹。”

说着，她大哭起来，泪珠簌簌滚落在前胸，再次高声喊道：“每当我要衣服、首饰时，你总是说：‘不，不！’”

丈夫惊慌失措，站起来，从钱柜里拿出一把金币，放在妻子面前，柔声和气地说：“亲爱的，上街去吧，想买什么就买什么吧！”

打那天起，聋妻每当想要什么东西时，总是眼噙泪水站在丈夫面前；丈夫则不声不响地从钱柜里拿出金币，放在妻子眼前。

后来，这位年轻女人恋上了一个习惯于长途旅行的小伙子；每当小伙子远行，聋女人总是在枕边哭泣，每逢富翁看见妻子落泪，便暗自想：“定是新商队来了，有珍奇首饰珠宝上市！”

这时，富翁便拿出一把金币，丢给妻子……





探寻


大约一千年以前，两位哲学家在黎巴嫩的一个山坡上相遇，其中一位哲学家问另一位：“你到哪儿去？”

另一位哲学家回答：“我来寻找青春泉，该泉像花一样在太阳下闪闪发光。你在找什么？”

第一位答：“我在探寻死亡的秘密。”

这时，两位哲学家都知道对方缺少许多学问，尽管知识丰富。他俩开始争论起来，都责斥对方神经紊乱。

两位哲学家正像狂风一样咆哮时，一个陌生人经过二者的身边，村上人认为此人天真、可怜，一无所知。听到那两个人大声争吵，陌生人站了一会儿，仔细聆听他们的论据。

之后，陌生人走近二位哲学家，说：“看来你俩属于同一哲学派，谈的是一件事情，只不过用的是不同语词。一位寻找青春泉，一个探寻死亡的秘密，其实二者是统一的，同时存在于你俩体内。”

陌生人告辞，同时说：“二位贤哲，再见吧！”转过身去，只听他又发出平静的笑声。

二位哲学家相互默默地望了望，然后一起笑了。一位对另一位说：“好吧！我们现在一起探寻不好吗？”





权杖


国王对王后说：“夫人，你算不上真正的王后！你十分平庸无礼，不配当我的终生伴侣！”

王后说：“你自认为是国王，其实不过是前人可怜的回声！”

这话激怒了国王，只见他抄起权杖，金把手直打在王后的前额上。

这时太监走了进来，说：“怎么啦？这权杖出自王国伟大的艺术家之手，真可惜呀！有那么一天，陛下和王后会被人忘却，而这权杖作为珍贵艺术品，将一代一代传下去。现在，它沾上了王后殿下头上的血，它将变得更有价值，更有纪念意义。”





路


一个女人和她的儿子住在山上。孩子是母亲的大儿子，也是她的独生子；母亲将心中和生命中的一切情感和怜悯都倾注在儿子身上。

孩子死于突然高烧，当时医生就在孩子身边。

悲痛撕裂了母亲的心！她哭叫不止，对医生说：“告诉我！告诉我！是什么终止了他的活动，是什么终止了他的歌声？”

“是高烧。”医生说。

“什么是高烧？”母亲问。

医生回答：“我无法解释。那是一种极小的东西进入了人体，我们用肉眼看不到它。”

医生离去，那位母亲还在重复着医生的话：“一种极小的东西，我们用肉眼看不见它。”

当晚牧师前来安慰她，她在牧师面前哭着说：“我为什么失去了我的儿子，我的独生子，我的大儿子？”

牧师回答：“孩子，这是上帝的旨意。”

妇人说：“上帝是何人？上帝在哪里？我想见见他，当着他的面撕开我的胸膛，把我的血洒在他的双脚上。告诉我，我能找到他吗？”

牧师说：“上帝至大，无边无际，用人类的肉眼无法看见他。”

妇人高声喊道：“极小者秉至大者旨意，害死了我的儿子！我们呢？那么我们是什么？我们又是什么呀？”

这时妇人的母亲来了，拿着孩子的敛衣进了房间。牧师的话及女儿的呼喊，她都听见了。老妇人把敛衣扔在地上，拉住女儿的手，说：“孩子，我们既是极小者，又是至大者。我们是二者之间的路。”





鲸鱼与蝴蝶


一日傍晚，曾有一面之交的一男一女同登上一辆旅行车。

男子是诗人，坐在女子身旁。为散心解闷，诗人开始给女子讲故事。那些故事有自编的，也有听来的。

诗人讲着讲着，女子睡着了。车子突然一颠，女子惊醒过来。

她说：“我喜欢你对约拿(1)与鲸鱼的故事所作的新解。”

诗人说：“不过，夫人，我讲的是自编的，说的是蝴蝶与白玫瑰如何相互转变的故事。”




————————————————————

(1) 约拿：《圣经·旧约》中人物，希伯来先知。据“约拿书”记载，耶和华命约拿去尼尼微城警告居民，约拿违抗命令，上船出海，耶和华使海中起大风，船上人将约拿抛入大海，又是耶和华的安排，约拿被一条大鱼吞掉。约拿祷告求救，被吐在旱地上，才被迫去尼尼微城传达耶和华的警告。





和平感染


满缀鲜花的枝条对邻近一枝条说：“这是最无聊、最空虚的一天。”另一枝条回答：“真是空虚无聊极了。”

这时，一只麻雀飞来，落在一枝条上，随后又飞来一只麻雀，落在第一只麻雀旁边。

一只麻雀吟唱道：“我的老伴弃我而去……”

另一只麻雀高声说：“我的老伴也走了，而且不再回来，那有什么关系？”

两只麻雀开始对话，各自斥责对方，继之争吵起来，空中一片嘈杂。

突然另外两只麻雀自天上俯冲下来，从容地落在争吵的两只麻雀旁边。不久，天空中出现一片安静、和平气氛。

之后，四只麻雀成双成对飞去了。

满缀鲜花的枝条对另一枝条说：“麻雀的到来，掀起一片嘈杂。”

另一枝条说：“随你叫它什么，现在却是安静、和平的。假若天空的高层处于和平之中，那么，依我看，住在下层的人们也会生活在和平之中。你不想在风中摇晃的幅度更大一些，免得总离我那么远吗？”

“好啊！为了和平，我照你的意志办。春天很快就要过去了。”

满缀鲜花的枝条在风中用力摇摆，以便拥抱另一枝条……





树影


六月的一天，小草对一棵大树影子说：“你总是左右摇动，搅得我的心不得安宁。”

树影回答道：“移动的不是我！你瞧瞧天空，那里有棵树在风中东摇西摆，在天与地之间来回晃动。”

小草抬头仰望，第一次看到了那棵大树，暗自说：“嗬，还有比我大得多的草呢！”

随后默不作声了。





古稀之年


年轻诗人对公主说：“我爱你。”公主回答：“我也爱你，孩子。”

诗人说：“可是，我不是你的孩子，我是个男子汉，我真爱你。”

公主说：“我是母亲，儿女成群。我的儿女都当了父亲和母亲，他们也已儿女成群。我的孙子都比你的年龄大。”

年轻诗人说：“然而我爱你。”

时隔不久，公主死去。但是，当大地接受她的最后一息之时，她暗自说：“我亲爱的！我亲爱的孩子！我的年轻诗人！也许有朝一日，我们再次相见，但那时我不会是古稀之年。”





寻找上帝


一次，两个人漫步在山谷之中。其中一个人指着山上说：“你看见那座禅房了吗？那里住着一个人，弃绝世间红尘已久。地上的东西，他一概不要，一心想找到上帝。”

另一个人说：“他是找不到上帝的，除非他离开禅房，放弃孤独隐居，回到世间，与我们同乐共悲，在婚宴上与狂欢者一道起舞，在死者的灵柩旁随悲痛者一起挥泪。”

前者从内心里相信此话有理，但他回答说：“我同意你的说法。但我相信那位修道士是个好人。一个好人离群索居的善举，不是比这些表面善良者的作为更有益得多吗？”





大河


卡迪沙河谷的两条小溪相汇在大河奔流的地方，二者开始对话。

第一条小溪说：“朋友，你是怎么来的？路上顺利吗？”

第二条小溪答道：“我的路崎岖难行，障碍无数。水磨的轮子坏了，借运河引我的水灌溉庄稼的农夫死了。我不得不艰苦挣扎，携带着那些整日无所事事，在太阳下用他们的懒肉烤面包的人扔下的垃圾什物，缓慢地渗流。朋友，告诉我，你一路上情况如何？”

第一条小溪说：“我的路途则不同：我从香花翠柳环抱的山丘顶上飞泻而下；男男女女用银杯畅饮，把我视作甘泉；孩童们见我而纷纷赤足涉入水中；在我的周围，尽是人们的欢声笑语，甜美的歌声直飞九霄，欢乐充满云天。你的路途不像我这样幸福，真是悲剧！”

这时大河高声说：“来吧！来吧！我们将奔向大海。来吧！来吧！不要再说什么！现在和我一道走，我们奔向大海。来呀，来呀！跟着我走，你会忘掉迷途上的欢乐与忧愁。来吧，请进来，到了我们的大海母亲的怀抱，我和你都会把我们所走过的路统统忘掉。”





两个猎人


五月的一天，欢神与悲神相遇在一个湖畔。相互问好后，在平静的湖水边上坐下来，开始了交谈。

欢神谈及覆盖大地并使森林、高原充满生机的惊人之美，还谈到黎明和暮霭时分所听到的销魂之歌。

悲神说话了，表示完全同意欢神的看法。因为悲神深知时光的魅力及其内在美。当谈到五月里田间和高原的美景时，悲神口齿伶俐，言辞娓娓动听。

两位神灵谈了许久，关于彼此见闻的看法完全一致。

这时，湖的对面出现两个猎人，隔水望着两位神灵。其中一个人说：“奇怪呀，这两个人是谁呢？”另一个猎人说：“说什么，两个人？我只看见一个。”

第一个猎人说：“那里是有两个人。”第二个猎人说：“我只能看清一个，湖水里还有一个倒影。”

第一个猎人说：“不，那里有两个人；湖水里的倒影也是两个。”

第二个猎人又说：“我只看见一个。”

“但我清清楚楚地看见是两个。”第一个猎人再次强调。

直到今天，仍然一个说另一个看花了眼；而另一个却说：“我朋友的眼有些瞎。”





另一个流浪汉


一天，我遇到另外一个在路上游荡的人。他也有些疯癫。他对我说：

“我是个流浪者。大部分时间里，我总是随着流浪汉们四处游荡。我的头要比他们的头高出七十腕尺(1)，我的头脑能创造更高、比他们的思想更开放的思想。

“可是，实际上，我并不与人们一起行走，而是在他们的上方。人们所能看到的，不过是留在他们旷野上的脚印。

“我经常听他们争论我的脚印的形状和大小。有的说：‘这是远古的龙周游大地留下的足迹。’也有人说：‘不！这是高空流星陨落的地方。’

“可是，朋友，你最清楚，这不过是一个流浪者的脚印……”

被折断的翅膀





小序


当爱神用其神奇光芒打开我的眼界，以其火一般的手指第一次触摸我的心灵时，我刚满十八岁。赛勒玛·凯拉麦是第一位以其纯美唤醒我的灵魂的女性。正是她带着我走向崇高情感的天园；在那里，白昼像美梦一样闪过，黑夜婚礼似的消逝。

赛勒玛，正是她以她的美丽教育我崇拜美，用她的柔情让我看到爱情的隐秘，正是她对我吟诵了精神生活长诗的第一行诗。

哪一个青年能不记得第一个用温情柔语、纯洁无瑕、美丽容貌使自己青年时代的疏忽大意、漫不经心为惊魂动魄、触及心神、豁然开朗的觉醒所替代的少女？我们当中谁能不无限思恋那样的奇妙时刻：当他留意之时，突然发现自己的整个身心发生了翻天覆地的变化，内心深处开阔、舒展开来，继而充满激动之情，因不肯吐露真实情况所带来的种种苦涩而令人感到欢快，又因由此引起的泪水流淌、思念及失眠而令人心满意足。

每个青年都有自己的赛勒玛，出现在自己生命春天的疏狂时期，使自己生活充满诗情画意，令自己白昼的孤寂被温馨所取代，夜晚的静寞被歌声所替换。

当我听到爱情通过赛勒玛的双唇在我心灵的耳旁窃窃私语时，我在大自然的影响与书籍、旅行的启示之间感到茫然若失，不知所措。当我看到赛勒玛像光柱一样矗立在我的面前时，我的生活一片空旷、荒芜、凄凉，酷似天堂中亚当昏睡不醒。赛勒玛·凯拉麦正是这颗充满秘密和奇迹之心的夏娃；正是她使这颗心晓知了存在的实质，使之像一面镜子一样竖立在这些幻影的面前。始祖夏娃用自己的意志和亚当的顺从，将亚当带出了天堂；而赛勒玛·凯拉麦则用她的甜美和我的适应性，将我带入了爱情和圣洁的乐园。但是，人类始祖的遭遇也降临到了我的身上，将亚当逐出天堂的火剑就像以利刃寒光威胁我的宝剑一样，在我违背训诫和品尝善恶果之前，就将我强行驱逐出了爱情乐园。

如今，那黑暗的岁月已经过去，用它的脚抹去了那些日子的画面，美梦留给我的只有痛苦的回忆，就像看不见的翅膀一样在我的脑袋四周扑扇拍击，激起我内心深处发出忧伤叹息，使我的眼睛落下失望与悔恨的泪滴……赛勒玛，俊美、纯洁的赛勒玛已走到蓝色暮霭之后去了。她留在这个世界上的痕迹只有存在于我心中的悲痛和位于松柏树荫上的一块大理石墓碑。那座墓和这颗心，只有二者堪谈关于赛勒玛的存在，而那守卫坟墓的寂静，决不会泄露神灵隐藏在棺材黑暗中的秘密，吸收逝者遗体养分的树枝也不会用叶子的沙沙响声道出墓穴内幕。至于这颗心的痛苦和忧伤，它是会说话的，而且现在正随着墨水滴落而倾诉，将爱神、美神和死神演出的那场悲剧幻影公布给光天化日。

散居在贝鲁特城的我的青年时期的朋友们，当你们路过松柏林附近的那片墓地时，请你们进到里面，不要作声，要缓缓行走，以免你们的脚步声惊扰长眠黄泉之下者的遗骸，恭恭敬敬地站在赛勒玛的墓旁，代我问候掩埋她的遗体的黄土，然后叹着气提醒我一句，并且请你们心中默默言道：“啊，在这里，埋葬着那位青年的希望，灾难已将他逐出到了海外；就在这里，他的愿望泯灭了，他的欢乐阴翳了，他的眼泪流尽了，他的微笑消失了。他的惆怅在这无声荒冢之间与翠柏绿柳一道生长。他的灵魂伴着回忆每天夜里都在这座墓上盘旋，与寂寞的幻影一道重复着悲凉、凄苦的挽歌，与树枝一道哭悼一位少女：昔日，她是生命双唇间的一支动人的欢乐；如今，她已变成地心里一个无声的秘密。”

青年朋友们，我要你们凭你们心爱的姑娘起誓，定把花环放在我心爱的那位姑娘的坟上；但期你们放在一座被遗忘的坟墓上的那朵花，就像清晨的眼睛滴在凋谢的玫瑰花瓣间的露珠。





无言的悲伤


众人们，你们想必总是回忆起青春的黎明之时，期望青春画面回返，惋惜它的逝去。至于我，想起那时来，则像获得释放的囚徒回忆起监牢的墙壁和沉重的镣铐。你们把从童年到青年之间的那段时光称为黄金时代；其时，人全然不识愁苦滋味，就像蜜蜂越过腐臭沼泽飞向花团锦簇的果园那样，展翅高翔在种种烦恼、忧虑的上空。然而，我却只能将我的少年时代称为无声无形的痛苦时代；其时，那种种痛苦就像暴风一样居于与发作在我的心中各个角落，随着我的心发育成长而增多，直到爱神进入我的心中，打开心扉，照亮各个角落，那暴风方才离开那里，卷入知识世界的出口。爱情解放了我的舌头，我会说话了；爱情撕开了我的眼帘，我会哭泣了；爱情开启了我的喉咙，我会叹息诉苦了。

众人们，你们想必记得看见你们玩耍，听到你们纯洁心灵低语的田间、果园、广场和街道；而我也记得黎巴嫩北部那个美丽的地方。我只要合上双眼，不看周围的一切，那充满神奇和庄严的山谷和那座座以光荣与宏伟高耸入云的山峰便油然浮现，清澈可见；只要捂上双耳，不听那社会传来的喧嚣声，那条条溪水的潺潺流水声和那千枝万叶的沙沙响声便自然响在耳边。不过，我现在提及并思念的美妙景色只是乳儿对母亲的怀抱贪婪而已。正是那片美景折磨着我那被囚禁在少年时期的昏暗之中的灵魂，酷似笼中的猎隼看见一群群猎隼自由翱翔在广阔天空时所遭受的折磨。正是那片美景在我脑中充满静观的病痛和沉思的苦涩，并用半信半疑、模棱两可的手指在我的心周围织就了一层绝望的纱包。我每到旷野去，总是愁眉苦脸而归；至于悲伤原因何在，我则全然不得而知。我每逢傍晚抬眼远望那被夕阳染成的云彩，总是感到心中郁闷难耐；至于郁闷意味着什么，我则完全猜不出。我每当听到鸟(1)鸣唱或溪水欢歌，我总是悲伤地停下脚步；至于悲伤默示着什么，我仍然不知其中奥秘。

人们说：“愚昧是空虚的摇篮，空虚乃休闲之坟墓。”此种说法对于那些生来就是死人、活着如同行尸走肉的人来说，也许是正确的。但是，当盲目的愚昧居于醒悟的情感旁边时，那么，无知比无底深渊更加残酷，比死亡更加苦涩。一个多情善感而知识甚少贫乏的敏感少年，则是太阳之下不幸的人，因为他的心灵总是处于两种不同的可怕力量之间：一种看不见的力量，载着他遨游云端，让他看到美梦雾霭之外的绝美万物；另一种可见力量，将他禁锢在大地之上，用尘埃蒙住他的眼睛，让他惊恐、迷惘在一片漆黑之中。

愁苦生着丝绸般柔软、神经极端敏感的手，它能牢牢抓住人的心，令其尽尝孤独寂寞之苦。孤寂是愁苦的同盟军，同样也是每一种精神活动的亲密伙伴。面对孤独寂寞作用和惆怅苦闷影响的少年的心灵，颇像刚刚出花萼的白色百合花，在微风前瑟瑟抖动，花心迎着黎明之光开放，随着黄昏暗影的经过而合上花瓣。假若少年没有散心的娱乐场所和志同道合的友伴，那么，生活在他的面前就像狭窄的监牢一样，能够看到的只有四面结满的蜘蛛网。能够听见的只有各个角落传出的蛩虫鸣声。

拖累我的少年时代的愁苦并非源于我对娱乐场所的需求，因为当时我能玩耍的此类地方很多；也不是因为我没有志同道合的友伴，因为好友寻常，行处皆有。那种愁苦是我生来就有的一种心理病症，它使我喜欢离群独处，扼杀了我心灵中对于娱乐玩耍的倾向与爱好，摘去了我双肩上热望、幻想的翅膀，使我在万物面前就像倒映的画面，云天的色彩和树枝的线条，但却找不到一条通道，故无法顺之而下，化为溪流，唱着欢歌而奔向大海。

这便是我十八岁之前的生活面貌。在我经历的岁月中，那一年如同山顶，因为它使我停下脚步，仔细观看这个世界，让我看到了人类所走的路，让我看到了人类爱好的草原和他们所遇到的重重障碍以及他们的法律、传统的洞穴。

就在那一年，我获得了重生。一个人，假若不被愁苦孕育和被失望分娩，继而被爱情放在梦想的摇篮之中，那么，他的生命就如同存在于书中的空白一页。

就在那一年，我看见天使透过一位美娘的眼神望着我；我还看见地狱的魔鬼们在一个罪恶男子的胸膛上大喊大叫，竞相奔跑。在生活的美妙与丑恶之中，谁没有看见过天使和魔鬼，他的心将始终远离知识，他的灵魂里也是一片空白，没有情感。

命运之手


在那充满奇异事情一年的春天，我在贝鲁特。四月的春风催开了百花，吹绿了城市花园里一片绚丽景象，仿佛那就是大地向蓝天宣告的秘密。巴旦杏树和苹果树穿上了洁白的香衣，展现在房舍之间，活像身着雪白盛装的天上仙子，受大自然派遣下凡，要做诗才横溢、想象力勃发的文人墨客的新娘和妻子。

天涯处处春光美，但最美的春天却在叙利亚(1)……春乃未名神灵之魂，快步巡游在大地上，当来到叙利亚时，便放慢了脚步，回眸后望，与遨游在太空的帝王、先知们的灵魂相亲相近，和犹太国(2)的溪流同唱所罗门的不朽《雅歌》(3)，与黎巴嫩杉树一起重忆古老光荣。

春天的贝鲁特要比其余季节里美丽得多，因为春时既没有冬天的泥泞，也没有夏日的沙尘；处于冬季的雨水与夏令的炎热之间的贝鲁特，就像一位俏丽的少女，刚刚用溪水洗浴过，坐在岸上，正用阳光揩拭她那嫩白丰满的胴体。

在那充满阳春四月的沁人肺腑气息和令人振奋微笑的一天里，我去拜访了一位朋友。他住在远离社会尘嚣的一座房子里。当我们正用话语勾画我们的希望和理想线条时，一位可敬的老人走了进来。那老人年已花甲过五，朴素衣着和多皱的面孔足以表明他的庄重严肃。于是，我立即恭恭敬敬地站了起来。在我与他握手、问安之前，我的朋友走上前来，介绍说：

“这位是法里斯·凯拉麦先生。”

之后，朋友又报了我的名字，并说了句称赞的话。老人凝神注视了我片刻，用手指摸着他那布满雪白头发的高高前额，仿佛想追忆被忘却了的某件旧事的图景，然后微微一笑，绽现出兴奋的神情，走近我说：

“你是我的一位老朋友的儿子，我的青春岁月都是陪伴着他度过的。能看到你，我是多么高兴！我多么想通过你见见你的父亲啊！”

听老人这样一说，我很激动，只觉得有一股无形的吸引力将我放心地拉近他，就像暴风来到之前，天性将鸟雀引领到自己的巢里。我们坐下来，老人便开始向我们讲起他与我父亲昔日的友情，追忆着与我父亲共度过青春的年华，讲述着已被岁月用自己的心裹上了敛衣，并用自己的胸埋葬了的往昔的故事……老人们回忆自己的青年时代，就像江湖游子思返故乡的情感一样；他们喜欢讲述少年时代的故事，如同诗人喜吟自己的得意杰作。他们总是依靠居于往时角落的一种精神生活着，因为现实在他们的面前飞闪而过，从不顾盼他们；而未来，在他们的眼中，好像也罩着一层灰蒙蒙的雾霭和坟墓里的幽暗。

我们在交谈、回忆中度过的一个时辰，就像树荫掠过青草地那样飞闪过去了。法里斯·凯拉麦站起身来要离去，我急忙上前去与他告别。他用右手拉住我的手，左手搭在我的肩膀上，说：

“我已二十年没有见到你的父亲了，但期你常来玩，以弥补你父亲长久远离之缺憾。”

我弯腰施礼表示感谢，并答应儿子尽到对父亲的好友应尽的义务。

法里斯·凯拉麦出门后，我的朋友又用带着某种谨慎的口气，向我讲了他的一些情况。我的朋友说：

“在贝鲁特，我不知道有第二个像他这样的人：财富使他成了公德高尚之人，而美德又使他变得更加富有。有极少数的人能够从来到世上起，到离开世上为止，从不伤害任何一个人的心灵；而这位老者则是这极少数人当中的一位。不过，这些人往往都是不幸的受气者，因为他们不懂得如何用计谋挣脱人们的奸诈与狠毒……法里斯·凯拉麦有个独生女，与他一起住在城郊的一座豪宅里。女儿的性格很像父亲，在女性中没有像她那样温柔娴淑、容貌俊秀的姑娘。不过，她也是很不幸的，因为父亲的大笔财富现已使她站在一个可怕的无底深渊的边沿。”

我的朋友说出这后几句话时，面上浮现出忧虑和惋惜的阴云。之后，他又说：

“法里斯·凯拉麦是位心地善良、品格高尚的老人，但却是个意志软弱的人；人们的伪善领着他走，就像是领着一个盲人；人们的贪婪让他止步，就像让一个哑巴站住。他的女儿虽然心存巨大力量和才能，但却完全屈从于父亲的薄弱意志。这便是隐藏在父女生活背后的秘密。有一个贪婪而伪虚、狠毒而狡诈的人晓知了这一秘密，这个人便是大主教；他用《圣经》掩盖他的丑魂，俨然在人们面前显得像美德一样。他是多宗教、多教派之国中的一教之主，人们的灵魂和肉体都害怕他，都像牲口在屠夫面前低下脖子那样，在他面前俯首顶礼膜拜。这位大主教有个侄子，各种腐朽、罪恶因素在他心灵中相争互斗，酷似蝎子、毒蛇在山洞、沼泽边上翻滚。没过几天，大主教就要穿着他的黑衣长袍，让他的侄子站在他的右边，让法里斯的女儿站在他的左边，举起他那罪恶的手，将结婚花环置于二人的头上，用预言、符咒的锁链将一个圣洁的躯体与一具腐尸连在一起，用腐败法律之掌将一个天魂与一个泥团捏合在一起，将灿烂白昼之心放在昏暗黑夜胸中。关于法里斯老人及其女儿的情况，现在我只能给你讲这么多，你不要问更多的事情。因为一提灾难，灾难就会临近，就像怕死一样，死亡会立即来临。”

说到这里，我的朋友转过脸去，透过窗子向天空望去，仿佛想在能媒中寻觅日与夜的秘密。

这时，我原地站起身来，握住他的手，与他告别时，对他说：

“明天我去拜访法里斯·凯拉麦，一方面履行我的诺言，另一方面表示对他与我父亲友谊留下的珍贵回忆的敬重。”

我的朋友愣了片刻，他的面色也变了，仿佛我那简单的两句话引发他产生了一种新的可怕的想法。之后，他用奇异的目光久久注视着我，那目光中包含着友爱、同情与恐惧，就像先知的目光，看到灵魂深处有一种连灵魂自身都不知道的东西。他的双唇颤动了一会儿，但什么也没说。我离开他，带着杂乱心绪向门口走去。在他向后转身之前，我看到他的双眼仍在用奇异的目光望着我；我始终没有弄明白那目光的含义，直至我的心灵脱离了可以度量的世界，飞向了天国，在那里心与心凭眼神相互了解，灵魂靠相互了解而成长。

在神殿门口


几天之后，我厌倦了孤单独处，也看累了书的愁容，于是登上马车，直奔法里斯·凯拉麦家而去。当车子行至人们常来游玩的松树林时，车夫调转马头，离开大路，一阵小跑，拐入一条柳荫走廊，两旁绿草葱茂，葡萄藤架枝叶繁茂，四月的鲜花张着口绽现出微微笑容，红的像玛瑙，蓝的像祖母绿宝石，黄的像金子。

不大一会儿，马车便在一座孤零零的住宅前停了下来。那座住宅周围是个大花园，树木枝条相互搭肩拥抱，空气中散发着玫瑰花、茉莉花和素馨花的芳香。

我刚在花园里走了几步，法里斯·凯拉麦便出现在宅门口，走来迎接我，仿佛响在那个孤零零地方的车马声已经宣布我的到来。老人笑容满面地表示欢迎，随之把我带进客厅，像一位思念心切的父亲那样让我坐在他的身旁，开始和我交谈，细问我的过去，探询我未来有何打算。我一一回答老人的问话，语气中充满美妙梦想和雄心宏愿的音调，这也是青年人在被幻想推上艰苦、麻烦频频而至的实际工作岸边之前惯于引吭高歌的调门儿……青年时代生着诗的翎羽、幻想神经的翅膀，青年人凭之飞上云端，看见世间的一切都像彩虹一样，五光十色，耀眼夺目，美不胜收；他们听到世间生灵无不放声唱着光荣与辉煌的赞歌。但是，那诗情画意一般的幻想翅膀不久就会被严厉考验的暴风撕碎，青年们也无可奈何地落到现实世界上；那现实世界是一面奇怪的镜子，人会从中看到自己的心灵那样渺小，那样丑陋。

就在这时，一位少女出现在天鹅绒门帘前，身着洁白光亮的绸衣，缓步朝我走来。她站住后，法里斯老人站起来向我介绍说：

“这是我的女儿赛勒玛。”

老人道出了我的姓名，介绍了我的情况之后，说：

“许久许久没有见到那位老朋友了，如今岁月让我看到了他的儿子。”

少女走到我的面前，眷恋凝视着我的双眸，仿佛想求我的眼神讲出我的真情实况，从中得知我的来意。然后，她握住我的手；她的手洁白、柔嫩，足以与田野上的百合花相媲美。手掌相接触的那一霎那，我的心中顿生一种奇异的新情感，很有些像作家驰骋想象力开始构思诗句时的心情。

我们默默地坐下来，仿佛赛勒玛把一种暗示沉静、庄重的高尚精神带进了客厅。好像她感觉到了那一点，于是望着我，微笑着说：

“家父常常对我谈起令尊大人，多次讲起他俩青年时代的故事。如果令尊大人给你讲过那些往事，那么，我们之间见面就不会是第一次了。”

法里斯老人听女儿这样一说，眉开眼笑，欣喜不已。他说：

“赛勒玛在爱好和主张上都是精神至上者。在她看来，世间一切东西都遨游在心灵世界中。”

就这样，法里斯老人又全神贯注、无限温情地与我交谈起来，宛如在我的身上发现了一种神奇的秘密，使他重新坐上回忆的翅膀，向着逝过的青春岁月飞去。

老人凝目注视着我，试图追回自己青春时代的影像；我则凝神注目着他，梦想着自己的未来。他望着我，就像布满季节变化痕迹的参天大树，俯视着一棵充满雄心大志、盲目生机的幼苗；大树年迈根深，饱经岁月的酷夏寒冬和时代狂风暴雨的考验，而幼苗却弱小柔嫩，只见过春天，晨风吹来便瑟瑟颤抖。

赛勒玛默不作声，时而望望我，时而瞧瞧父亲，仿佛正在我俩的脸上阅读故事的首章和末尾。

白昼叹着气从花园和果林中走过。夕阳西下，留给老人宅院对面的黎巴嫩高山峰巅金黄色的吻痕。法里斯·凯拉麦向我讲述了他的故事，令我惊异出神；我在他面前尽情唱着我的青春之歌，使他感到欣悦。赛勒玛坐在窗子旁边，用悲凉的双眸望着我们，一动不动，静听我们谈话，一声不吭，仿佛她知道美自身有一种语言，浑然天成，无需口舌发出的声音与节奏；那是一种永恒的语言，包含人类的全部音韵，使之成为一种无声的情感，就像平静的湖泊，将万川溪流的歌声吸纳到自己的心中，使之成为永恒的寂静。美是一种秘密，只有我们的灵魂了解它，为它而欢欣鼓舞，依靠它的作用而成长发育；而我们的思想，则站在它的面前不知所措，虽竭力试图用语言给它下个定义，将之形象化，但却完全无能为力。美是一种眼睛看不见的暗流，在观者的情感与可见事实之间波涌翻动奔流。真正的美是一种光，发自于灵魂中最神圣的地方，照亮肉体的外表，酷似生命源于果核之内，为鲜花送去彩色和芳香。美是男女之间顷刻之间达成的完全互相理解，霎那间诞生的凌驾于一切兴趣之上的爱慕之情，那便是被我们称为爱情的灵魂倾向。

那天傍晚，我的灵魂理解了赛勒玛的灵魂。究竟是这种相互理解使我把她看作太阳面前最美的姑娘，还是一种青春的醉态，使得我们幻想着根本不存在的美妙图景和幻影？莫非是青春使我双目昏黑，使我幻想到赛勒玛明眸放光、粉唇甜蜜、身段苗条，还是那种明光、甜蜜、苗条打开了我的眼界，以便让我眼观爱情的欢乐和痛苦？所有这些，我都说不清楚。但是，我却知道自己尝到了一种在此之前从未感受到的情感；那是一种崭新的情感，它绕着我的心从容不迫地蹒跚晃动，就像灵魂在创世之前徜徉在海面之上。我的幸福与不幸从那种情感中诞生，如同万物按照上帝的意志轮回出现，转世再生。

我与赛勒玛初次见面的时刻就这样过去了。苍天如此想，并且出乎意料地将我从困惑的奴役和少年的烦恼中解放出来，让我自由自在地行进在爱情行列里。爱情是这个世界上的唯一自由，因为它将灵魂提升到一个人类法律和传统达不到的崇高地位，就连自然法则与规律也无法控制它。

当我站起身来要告辞时，法里斯老人走近我，用真诚感人的声音说：

“现在，你已认识了到这家来的路，你到这里来，应该感到有一种把我引领到你父亲家的信心，应该把我和赛勒玛当成你的父亲和妹妹——不是吗，赛勒玛？”

赛勒玛点头表示同意。之后，她望了我一眼，那一眼，类似于一个迷路的异乡客忽然看到一个熟人时闪现的目光。

法里斯老人对我说的那番话，正是我与他的女儿一起站在爱神宝座前的第一曲，也是以痛哭、哀悼而结尾的天国之歌的序曲。那番话又是一种力量，给我俩的灵魂以激励，我们便接近了光和火。那番话也是杯盏，我们从中饮下了多福河水，也喝下了苦西瓜(1)汁。

我出了门，老人一直把我送到花园尽头。我告别了父女二人，心在胸中剧烈跳动，如同干渴者的双唇触及水杯沿时颤抖不止。

盛燃的白炽火炬


四月过去了。在过去的一个月里，我常去法里斯老人家，与赛勒玛见面，在花园里对坐长谈，细观她的美丽容颜，欣赏她的天赋才气，静听她那无声的忧愁，只觉得有无数只无形的手在把我拉向她。那每一次访问，都会向我揭示她的一重新含义和她灵魂奥秘中的一层高深秘密，致使她在我的眼前变成了一本书，我读了一行又一行，背了一节又一节，唱了一曲又一曲，却总也读不完，唱不尽。

神赐予女性以心灵美和形体美，那是既明显而又神秘的现实，我们只能用爱情理解她，用圣洁去感触她，而当我们试图用语言描绘她时，她却远离我们的视野，隐藏到迷惑和模糊的雾霭之后去了。

赛勒玛心灵、形体俱美，我如何向不认识她的人描述她呢？坐在死神翅膀阴影下的人怎么能唤来夜莺鸣啭、玫瑰细语和溪水吟唱呢？一个拖着沉重镣铐的囚俘怎能追赶黎明的微风吹拂？不过，沉默不是比说话更难过吗？既然我不能用金线条描绘赛勒玛的真实相貌，难道恐惧之意能够阻止我用浅薄词语叙述赛勒玛的一种幻影吗？行走在沙漠中的饥饿者，假若苍天不降甘露和鹌鹑，他是不会拒绝啃干面饼的。

赛勒玛身材苗条，穿着洁白长绸裙出现时，就像从窗子射进赛勒玛的容貌美并不合乎人类所制定的关于美的标准和尺度，而是一种像梦一样的奇异之美，或者说像幻影，或者说像一种神圣思想，不可丈量，无可比拟，不能界定，画师的笔描绘不出，雕刻家用大理石雕刻不成。赛勒玛的美不在于她那一头金发，而在于金发周围的圣洁光环；她的美不在于她那一对明亮的大眼睛，而在于明眸内闪烁出的亮光；她的美不在于她那玫瑰色的双唇，而在于唇间溢出的蜜糖；她的美不在于她那象牙色的脖颈，而在于脖颈微微前倾的形象。赛勒玛的美不在于她那完美的体形，而在于她的灵魂高尚得像是一柄盛燃的白炽火炬。遨游在大地与无尽天际之间。赛勒玛的美是一种诗情画意，我们只能在高雅诗篇、不朽的画作和乐曲中才能看到她的影子。才子们总是不幸的，无论他们的灵魂多么高尚，却总是被一层泪水包裹着。

去的月光。她举止缓慢、稳重，颇有些像《伊斯法罕曲》(1)。她的嗓音低沉、甜润，间或被叹息声打断，就像随着微笑波动，露珠从花冠上滴落而下一样，她的语音由绛唇间滑落而出。她的面容嘛，谁能描绘赛勒玛的面容呢？我们用什么样的字眼、词语，能够描述一张被痛苦、平静遮罩着的，而不是由透明面纱遮罩着的面容呢？我们用什么样的语言，能够谈论每时每刻都在宣布心灵秘密，每刻每时都在向观者提及一种远离这个世界的精神世界的容貌！

赛勒玛多思而寡言。不过，她的沉默是富有音乐感的，总是带着她的座客转移向遥远美梦的舞台，使之能听见自己的脉搏，可看到自己的思想幻影和情感出现在自己的眼前。

与赛勒玛品质和性格形影不离的特质是深沉、强烈的忧愁。

忧愁本是一种精神绶带，赛勒玛披上它，则使她的体态更加美丽、庄重、奇异，她的心灵之光透过布丝露出来，就像透过晨雾看到的一棵繁花盛开的大树，忧愁将我俩的灵魂紧紧联结在一起。我俩都能从对方的脸上看到自己内心的感受，都能从对方的胸中听到自己话语的回音，仿佛神灵已经把我们每个人变成了另一个人的一半，通过圣洁之手结合在一起，便成为一个完整的人；谁离开谁，都感到灵魂中有一种令人痛苦的缺憾。

一颗痛苦的心灵与另一颗有相似情感与感受的心灵结合在一起，能找到安慰与快乐，正如在远离祖国土地上的两个异乡客之间感到亲切一样。忧愁、患难之中相互贴近的心，浮华的欢乐是不能将它们分开的。心灵中用痛苦拧成的纽带要比欢乐织成的纽带牢固得多。眼泪洗刷过的爱情总是圣洁、美丽、永恒的。

暴风骤雨


过了几天，法里斯老人邀我到他家吃晚饭，我欣然前往。我的心灵很馋老天爷放在赛勒玛手中的那种圣饼。那是一种精神圣饼，我们用心中之口吞食，越吃越觉得饥饿；那是一种神奇圣饼，阿拉伯人盖斯(1)、意大利的但丁(2)、希腊的萨福(3)尝过它的滋味，不禁肝肠起火，心被熔化，那圣饼由神灵用亲吻的甜蜜和泪水的苦涩和成的面团做成，专供敏感、醒悟的心灵餐食，以便以其滋味令心灵欢欣，以其效应使心灵遭受折磨。

来到家中，我发现赛勒玛坐在花园一角的一张木椅上，头靠着一棵树干，身穿洁白长裙，像是一位幻想中的新娘，守在那个地方。我默不作声地走近她，像一个虔诚的拜火教徒坐在圣火前那样，在她的身旁坐了下来。我想说话，但发现自己张口结舌，双唇僵硬，只好沉默不语。一种无限深邃的情感，一经用具体语言表达出来，难免失却它的部分特殊意味。不过，我觉察得到，赛勒玛正在静听着我的内心自言自语；与此同时，她也从我的双眸中看到了我那颗颤抖心灵的影像。

片刻之后，法里斯老人来到花园，朝着我走来，照习惯向我伸出手来表示欢迎，似乎也想对我与赛勒玛两颗灵魂联结在一起的隐秘表示祝贺。他微笑着说：

“我的孩子，快来吃饭吧！晚饭在等着我们呢。”

我们站身来，跟着老人走去。赛勒玛用充满柔情的目光望着我，好像“我的孩子”一语唤醒了她内心的一种新的甜蜜感觉，其中包含着她对我的爱，如同母亲抱着孩子。

我们围桌坐下，边吃边喝边谈。我们坐在那个房间，津津有味地吃着各种可口美食，品尝着各种玉液琼浆，而我们的灵魂却不觉地遨游在远离这个世界的另一天地，梦想着未来，准备着应付各种可怕局面。三个人因生活志向不同，故想法各异，但他们的内心都怀有诚挚的友谊与至爱。三个人都是清白的弱者，他们感情丰富，而所知甚少，这便是心灵舞台上演出的悲剧。一位年高德劭的老人，甚爱自己的女儿，只关心女儿的幸福，一个芳龄二十岁的姑娘，对自己的未来总是近看看，远看看，注目凝视，目不转睛，以便看看究竟是什么欢乐和不幸在等待着自己；还有一个小伙子，梦想联翩，忧思重重，既没有尝过生活美酒的滋味，也没有喝过生活的酸醋，一心想鼓翼飞翔在爱情和知识的天空，但因太弱，站都站不起来。三个人在远离喧嚣城市的一座宅院里，围坐着一张精美雅致的餐桌，夜色一片寂静，天上的繁星凝视着庭院。三个人吃边喝，而天命却将苦涩与荆刺埋在了他们的盘底和杯中。

我们刚吃完饭，一个女人走了进来，对法里斯老人说：

“老爷，门外有人求见。”

老人问：

“谁呀？”

女仆回答道：

“我猜想他是大主教的家仆，老爷。”

法里斯沉默片刻，随后就像先知望着天空那样，凝视着女儿的眼睛，以便看看女儿隐藏的秘密。之后，他转过脸去，对女仆说：

“让他进来吧！”

女仆闻声离去，过了一会儿，一条汉子出现了，身着绣金长袍，髭须两端上翘，哈腰问过安好，便对法里斯说：

“大主教阁下派我用他的专用马车来接你，他请你去，有要事与你相商。”

老人站起来，脸色都变了，原本春风满面的脸忽然蒙上了一层沉思的面纱，然后走近我，用温柔、甜润的声音说：

“我希望回来时还能在这里见到你。你在这里，赛勒玛能得到安慰，说说话可以驱逐夜下的寂寞，心灵的乐曲能够消除孤单的烦闷。”

然后望着女儿，笑着问道：

“赛勒玛，不是这样吗？”

姑娘点头称是，面颊顿时稍显绯红，继而用足以与笛声比柔美的话音说：

“我会尽心尽力让我们的客人感到快乐的，爸爸！”

老人在大主教家仆的陪伴下出了门，赛勒玛凭窗而站，望着大路，直至马车的影子消隐在夜幕之中，随着车子渐渐远去，车轮声渐渐消失，马蹄的嗒嗒响声也被寂静吞没了。

赛勒玛在我对面的沙发上做下来，绿缎子的沙发布面衬托着她那洁白的长裙，她就像绿色草坪中被晨风吹弯腰的百合花。

老天有意成全我的心愿，让我在远离尘嚣的住宅与赛勒玛单独相会，更有万木护卫，一片寂静，爱情、圣洁和美的幻影自由徜徉、漫步在房舍四周。

几分钟过去了，我俩默默无言，不知所措，静静沉思，都在期盼着另一个人先开口说话。难道那就是实现相爱灵魂之间互解共通的话语吗？莫非那就是发自唇舌，使心神相互接近的声音与节拍吗？莫非没有一种东西比口说出的更高尚，比声带为之振动的更纯洁吗？那不就是将一个心灵送往另一心灵，将一颗心的低语传入另一颗心的无声寂静吗？那不就是寂静将我们从自身中解脱出来，遨游无边的精神太空，接近田园吗？我们感到自己的躯体不过是个狭窄牢笼，这个世界无异于遥远的流放地。

赛勒玛望着我，眼神里已透露出她心灵的秘密。之后，她用令人心荡神驰的镇静口吻说：

“我们到花园里去，坐在树下，观赏一下月亮爬上东山的壮景吧！”

我顺从地站起来，阻止说：

“赛勒玛，我们站在这里待到月亮升起、照亮花园不是更好吗？现在夜色笼罩着花木，我们什么也看不见呀！”

她回答说：

“黑暗即使能够遮住眼前的花草树木，但却遮挡不住心中的爱情。”

她用非同寻常的语气说了这么一句话，然后把目光转向窗子，我则默默思考着她的话，想象着每个词语的意思，琢磨着每个字的真实含义。过了一会儿，她转过脸来，凝神注视着我，仿佛对自己说出的话感到后悔，想借自己的神奇目光，从我的耳朵里收回她讲出的那句话。但是，那神奇目光的作用恰恰相反，不但收不回那些话，反倒使那些更清楚、更深刻地留在我的胸中，紧紧贴着我的心，随着我的情感起伏涌动到生命的最后一刻。

这个世界的每一件伟大、美好事物，均诞生于人内心深处的一种想法或一种感受。我们所看到的历代的作品，在其出现之前，原本都是隐藏在男子头脑中的一种想法或女子胸中的一种美好的情感……使鲜血像溪水一样流淌、奉自由作为神灵崇拜的可怕暴动，原本不过是生活在成千上万男子中的某位男子头脑中的一种浮想；令宝座倾覆、王国灭亡的痛苦战争，起初也仅仅是某个人头脑中的一个念头；改变人类生活进程的崇高学说，本来也只是才华出众的一个人心中的一种带有诗情的意向。一个想法建造了金字塔，一种情感毁灭了特洛伊城，一种念头创造了伊斯兰光荣，一句话烧毁了亚历山大城图书馆。

夜深人静时产生的一种想法，有可能带你走向光荣，也可能引你步入疯狂；一个女人的一瞥，可使你成为最幸福的人，也可能使你成为最不幸的人；一个男子说的一句话，可使你由穷变富，也可能使你由富变穷……在那静悄悄的夜里，赛勒玛说的那句话，使我像停泊在海涛与苍天之间的船一样站在过去与未来之间。一句意味深长的话将我从青年时代的昏睡和空虚中唤醒，把我的岁月带上通向死去活来的爱情舞台的一条新路。

我们来到花园里，行走在花木之间，只觉微风用它那看不见的手指抚摩着我们的脸面，鲜嫩的花和柔软的草在我们的脚下摇摆晃动。我们终于行至素馨花丛前，在一张长木椅子上默不作声地坐了下来，静听沉睡的大自然的呼吸，在透过蓝天望着我们的天目面前用甜润的叹息声揭示彼此心中的隐秘。

月亮爬上了萨尼山，月光洒遍山巅、海岸，山谷坡上的农村清楚地显现出来，仿佛无中生有，突如其来。整个黎巴嫩山脉出现在银色月华下，就像一位曲肱而枕的青年，盖着一层轻纱，肢体若隐若现。

西方诗人心目中的黎巴嫩是个梦幻般的地方。不过，就像随着亚当、夏娃被逐，天堂被遮掩起来那样，随着大卫(4)、所罗门(5)和众先知的逝去，黎巴嫩的真实面貌也渐而消隐了。黎巴嫩是一个诗般的词语，而不仅仅是一座山名，它象征着内心的一种情感，使人想象到一幅幅奇妙的美景：繁茂的杉树林，散发着袭人的清香；用青铜和大理石建成的高塔，那是光荣与伟大的标志；一群群羚羊蹒跚漫步在山冈和谷地。那天夜里，我看到黎巴嫩宛如诗意般的幻想，像白日的梦境一样呈现在我的眼前。随着我们情感的变化，我们眼前的一切东西都变了模样。当我们心灵中充满神奇的妖丽时，我们想象着一切东西都蒙上了神奇与妖丽的色彩。

赛勒玛望着我，月光照着她的面孔、脖颈和手腕，她就像美与爱之神阿施塔特的崇拜者雕刻成的一尊象牙雕像。

她问我：

“你为什么不说话呢？为什么不向我谈谈你过去的生活呢？”

我望着她那对明亮的眼睛，像突然开口说话的哑巴一样回答她说：

“我一来到这个地方就说话，难道你没有听见？自打进了花园，莫非你没有听见我说的话？你的心灵能听到百花低语和寂静唱歌，也一定能听见我的灵魂和心的呐喊声。”

她用手捂着自己的脸，然后用断断续续的声音说：

“我已听到你的声音……是的，我已听到了。我听到了发自夜的肺腑的呐喊声和发自白昼之心的高声喧嚣。”

我忘记了自己过去的生活经历，忘掉了自己的存在，忘记了一切，只知道赛勒玛，只感觉到她的存在，立即说：

“赛勒玛，我已听到了你的声音，听到了一曲起死回生、引人入胜的伟大歌声，太空中的尘埃为之波涌翻腾，大地之基因之摇晃震动。

赛勒玛合上眼，深红色的唇上绽现出一丝苦苦微笑，然后低声说：

“现在我知道了，有一种东西比天高，比海深，比生死和时光更强有力。我现在知道了那种昨天不知道，也不曾梦想过的那种东西。”

从那一时刻起，赛勒玛变得比朋友更亲密，比姐妹更亲近，比情人还可爱。她变成了一种与我的头脑形影不离的崇高思想，包围着我的心的一种温情和萦绕我心灵的一个美梦。

认为爱情必诞生于长期相处、久相厮伴的人们是多么无知啊！真正的爱情是灵魂互解的结晶；假若这种互解不能在片刻之内实现，那么，即使一年、一代也是实现不了的。

赛勒玛抬起头来，向着萨尼山与天边相接的遥远天际望去，然后说：

“昨天，你还像我的一位长兄，我放心地与你接近，在父亲在场的情况下，我可以坐在你的身旁。而现在，我觉得有了一种比兄妹关系更强烈、更甜蜜的东西。我觉得那是一种超越一切关系的奇妙情感，那是一种强烈、可怕、可爱的关系，使我的心中充满痛苦与欢乐。”

我回答她说：

“我们害怕的、我们的心胸为之颤抖的这种情感，难道不就是那种令月亮绕着地球转、地球绕着太阳转、太阳及其周围一切绕着上帝转的绝对规律的一部分吗？”

赛勒玛容光焕发，眼噙泪花，就像水仙花瓣上的露珠闪闪发光。她用手抚摩着我的头，将手指插在我的头发里，然后说：

“哪个人会相信我们的故事呢？谁相信我们在日落月出的时辰里，我们已跨越了怀疑与诚信之间的一切障碍和隘口呢？谁能相信我们初次见面的四月竟是让我们站在了生命最神圣殿堂的阳春之月呢？”

她说话时，我低着头，她的手一直在抚弄着我的头发。此时此刻，假若让我选择，我会放弃王冠和花环而选择抚弄我的头发如丝的那只柔嫩的手。

我回答说：

“人类不相信我们的故事，因为他们不知道爱情是唯一一朵不需季节合作而成长、发育的鲜花。难道让我们初次见面的是四月吗？使我们站在生命最神圣殿堂的是这一时辰吗？难道不是上帝之手在我们出生、沦为白昼与黑夜的俘虏之前，就把我们的灵魂融合在一起了吗？赛勒玛，人的生命并非从子宫里开始，也不是在坟墓前结束。这个充满月华星光的浩瀚宇宙，不乏以爱情相互拥抱的灵魂和以互解联合化一的心灵。”

赛勒玛轻轻地抽回自己的手，将电的波浪留在我的发束之中，在夜间的微风吹拂戏动下，波浪起伏翻动有增无减。我伸出双掌，捧住她那只手，就像虔诚的教徒抚摩圣坛的帷幔祈祷祝福那样，将之放在我那火热的双唇间，久久地、深深地亲吻；那热吻能用它的高温熔化人心的一切感受，能用它的甜美唤醒神灵中的一切纯真情感。

一个时辰过去了，其中的每一分钟均等同眷恋情深一年。夜色寂静，月光如水，周围是一片林木花草。当我们沉醉在忘掉一切、只晓爱情真实的境界之中时，忽然听到马蹄、车轮声在迅速地靠近我们，我们立即从那甜滋滋的昏迷中苏醒过来，由幻梦世界回到了使我们感到进退两难、困惑难堪的现实世界。我们知道法里斯老爹已从大主教家回来了，于是走出树林，等待他的到来。

马车在花园入口停下，法里斯老人下了车，低着头缓步朝我们走来。老人家如同背负重载，疲惫不堪，走到赛勒玛跟前，双手搭在她的肩上，久久凝视着她的面容，仿佛怕她的形象消失在他那昏花的双眼里。随之，老泪纵横，淌落在那他满布皱纹的面颊上，双唇抖动，绽现出凄楚的微笑，用哽咽的声音说：

“赛勒玛，过不多久……多不了几天，你就要离开爸爸的眼前，投入到另一位男子的怀抱中去了。过不了多久，上帝的教法就要把你从这个孤零零的家里带到宽广的天地中去了。到那时，这座花园将会思念你那缓慢稳重的脚步，爸爸也将变成陌生人了。赛勒玛，天命已经开口说话，愿苍天为你祝福，求苍天保佑你！”

赛勒玛听父亲这么一说，面色顿改，两眼呆滞，仿佛看到了死神的影子站立在她的面前。随即，她抽抽噎噎地哭了，像被猎人射中的鸟儿，扑扑棱棱地落在低洼地上，疼得周身颤抖不止。她用被深深痛苦打断的声音大声喊道：

“您说什么？您说的是什么意思？您想把我打发到哪儿去呀？”

赛勒玛凝视着父亲，好像她想用目光揭去掩藏他胸中秘密的那层包裹里。一分钟死一般的沉寂过去之后，赛勒玛叹了一口气，说：“我现在明白了……我全明白了……大主教夺去了您的爱女……他为这只被折断翅膀的鸟儿准备好了笼子……爸爸，这就是您的想法和意志吧？”

法里斯老人只用深深的叹息做回答。然后将赛勒玛领进厅堂，慈爱之光从不安的面容上顿泻而出。我留在树林里，一时不知如何是好，情感被困惑戏动，如同秋风横扫落叶。过了一会儿，我跟着父女俩进了厅堂。为了掩饰爱打听别人隐私的好管闲事者的外表，我握住老人的手告别，又用类似于被淹死的人望着苍穹顶上一颗明亮的星星那样的目光望了望赛勒玛一眼，然后转身出了门，父女俩谁也没有觉察到我已离开那里。但是，当我行至花园尽头时，忽听老人呼唤我，我回头望去，发现他追了出来。我立即回头迎他。当他握住我的手时，用颤抖的声音说：

“原谅我，孩子！是我使你今夜以眼泪宣告结束。不过，你将会常来看我的，不是吗？当这个地方变得空空荡荡，只留下一个老人度过痛苦的风烛残年时，你能不来看我吗？当然，风华正茂不喜风烛残年，宛如清晨不与黄昏相会，但你将常来我这里，以便让我回忆起我在你父亲身旁度过的青春时光，让我重新听到那不再属于我的生活故事，难道不是这样吗？当赛勒玛走后，只有我一个人孤单单地住在这座远离众人家宅的房子里时，你会不常来看我吗？”

老人说出最后几句话时，声音低沉、断续。当我握住他的手，默默地抖动时，我感到几滴热泪夺眶而出，滴在了我的手上。此时此刻，我的心灵颤抖起来，只觉得对他有一种做儿子的情感在胸中涌动，甜蜜而痛苦，像口渴的感觉一样直冲上双唇，然后又像难言的痛苦一样回到心的深处。我抬起头来，看见他的泪水簌簌下落，我的眼泪也夺眶而出。他稍稍弯下腰，用颤抖的双唇吻了吻我的前额，然后把脸转向宅门，说：“晚安……晚安，孩子！”

满布皱纹的老人脸上那一滴闪光的泪水，要比青年人泪水滚滚给人的心灵带来的震撼强烈得多。

青年人的滚滚泪水溢自泪水充裕的心间，而老人的泪却倾于眼角的残余泪滴，也是虚弱体内的剩余活力。青年人的眼泪像玫瑰花瓣上的露珠，而老人的眼泪则像舞动的黄叶，预示着生命的冬天已经临近。

法里斯老人的身影消隐在两扇门后。我走出了那座花园，而赛勒玛的话音依然绕在我的耳际，她的美貌像幻影一样蹒跚行走在我的眼前，老人家的眼泪也在我的手上慢慢干了。我离开那个地方，宛如亚当离别了伊甸园，但这颗心中的夏娃却没有在我的身边，当然也就不能让整个世界变成天堂了……我离开那座宅院，只觉得那是我再生的一夜，也是我首次看到死神面孔的夜晚。

太阳能用自己的热量使大地充满勃勃生机，同样也能用自己的温度使大地死亡。

烈火之湖


人在漆黑夜里秘密所做的任何事情，也必将有人将之公布于光天化日之下。我们的唇舌在寂静之中的悄声低语，往往在我们不知不觉之时，便变成了公众谈论的话题。我们今天想隐藏在住宅角落里的事情，明天就会暴露，公开展示在街头巷尾。

同样，黑夜的幻影宣布了大主教保罗·伽里卜会见法里斯老人的目的。就这样，能媒将大主教的言谈话语带到了城中各区，也传进了我的耳际。

在那月明风清之夜，大主教保罗·伽里卜召见法里斯老人，并非为了与他商量穷苦人、残疾人的事情，也不是为了把寡母孤儿的情况告诉他，大主教用自己的豪华私人马车把老人接去，原来是替自己的侄子曼苏尔贝克·伽里卜向老人的女儿赛勒玛求婚。

法里斯·凯拉麦是位富翁，他的唯一继承人便是他的女儿赛勒玛。大主教要选赛勒玛做他的侄媳，既不是因为她的美貌，也不是因为她灵魂高尚，而是因为她富有，她那万贯家财足以保证曼苏尔贝克的前程，借助她的大笔钱财，足以使他能在贵族当中寻求到崇高地位。

东方的宗教领袖们不会满足于他们自己已经获得的尊严和权势，而是竭力让他们的后代居于众人之上，奴役人民，控制人民的人力、物力和财力。帝王驾崩，将荣誉传给自己的长子，而宗教领袖的光荣则像传染病一样传给兄弟及侄子。就这样，基督教的大主教、伊斯兰的伊玛目和婆罗门教的祭司，都像海中蛟龙一样，伸出无数巨爪捕捉猎物，张开无数大嘴吮吸猎物鲜血。

当保罗·伽里卜大主教代侄子求娶赛勒玛时，法里斯老人只得用深深的沉默和灼热泪水作答。当父亲要送别女儿时，即使女儿要嫁到邻居家或应选入皇宫，哪位父亲能不难过？当自然规律要一位男子同自己的女儿分别时，而那女儿是他自幼逗着她玩，继之教育、培养她成为妙龄少女，后来长大成朝夕相依为命的大姑娘，却要与他分别了，他的内心深处怎会不难过得颤抖战栗呢？对于父母亲来说，女儿出嫁的欢乐类似于儿子娶媳，只不过是后者给家庭增加了一个新成员，而前者则使家庭减少了一个亲密的老成员。法里斯老人被迫答应了大主教的要求，强抑心中的不悦情感，在大主教的旨意面前低下了头。老人家不但见过大主教的侄子曼苏尔贝克，而且常听人们谈起他来，深知其性情粗野、贪得无厌、道德败坏。可是，在叙利亚，哪个基督教徒能够反抗大主教，同时又能在信仰民中受到保护呢？在东方，哪一个违背宗教领袖意愿的人能在人们当中受到尊重呢？与箭对抗的眼睛，怎能逃避被射瞎的命运？与剑搏斗的手臂，怎会不被斩断？即使老人家能够违抗保罗大主教的意愿，他能够保证女儿的名声不遭猜疑与毁灭吗？女儿的名字能够不遭受众口舌的玷污吗？在狐狸看来，高悬的葡萄不都是酸的吗？

就这样，天命狠狠抓住了赛勒玛，将她作为一个低贱的奴隶卷入了不幸东方妇女的行列。就这样，一个高尚的灵魂刚刚展开圣洁的爱情翅膀，在月光朦胧、百花溢香的天空中遨游之时，便落入了罗网。

在多数地方，父辈的大笔钱财往往是女儿不幸的起因。靠父亲辛勤努力、母亲精打细算填充起来的宽大金库，顷刻之间便会化为继承者心灵的黑暗狭窄牢笼。人们顶礼膜拜的伟大财神，瞬间会变成折磨灵魂、毁灭心神的可怕恶魔。赛勒玛像许多不幸的姑娘一样，成了父亲巨财和新郎贪婪的牺牲品。假若法里斯不是一个富翁，那么，赛勒玛今天也会像我们一样，快活地生活在阳光下。

一个星期过去了。赛勒玛的爱总是陪伴着我：黄昏时，那真挚的爱在我的耳边吟唱幸福之歌；黎明时，那执着的爱将我唤醒，让我瞻望生活的意义和存在的秘密。那是神圣的爱，不知何为嫉妒，因为它无求于人；它不会使肉体感到痛苦，因为它在灵魂深处。那是一种强烈的慕爱之情，它会使心灵得到极大的满足。那是一种极度深刻的饥饿，它以知足填满人心。那是一种情感，它能使思念之情诞生，但却不激发思念之情。那是一种迷人心窍的蜃景，使我视大地为一片乐土，令我看人生是一场美梦。早晨，我行走在田野上，在大地的苏醒中看到了永生象征；我坐在海岸边，从大海波涛里听到了永恒歌声；我走在城市大街上，从行人的脸上和劳动者行动中看到了生活的美和繁荣的欢乐。

那是像幻影一样过去、像雾霭一样消失的日子，在我的心中留下的只有痛苦的记忆。那眼睛，我曾用它看过春令的美景和田野的苏醒；如今，它看到的只有暴风的愤怒和冬天的失望。那耳朵，我曾用它听到波涛的歌声；如今，它只能听到心灵深处的呻吟和深渊的号丧声。那心灵，曾是多么敬重人类的活力和兴盛的光荣；如今，它却只能感到贫困的不幸和堕落者的悲惨。谈情的日子多么甜润，说爱岁月之梦何其甘美！痛苦之夜多么苦涩，何其可怕啊！

周末的黄昏时分，我的心灵沉醉在情感的美酒之中，于是向赛勒玛的家走去。她的家宅是美所建造、爱所崇拜的圣殿，为的是让心灵在那里顶礼膜拜，虔诚祈祷。当我行至那座寂静的花园时，我感到有一种力量在吸引着我，将我带出这个世界，让我缓慢地接近一个没有争斗的神奇天地。我只觉得自己就像一位苏菲派(1)教徒，被天引向幻梦境界，我忽然发现自己行进在相互交织的树木与互相拥抱的鲜花之间。当我行至宅门口时，抬头一看，只见赛勒玛坐在素馨花树荫下的那张长椅上；那正是一周之前，在神灵选定的夜晚，我俩同坐的地方，是我幸福的开端，也是我不幸的源头。我默不作声地走近她，她纹丝不动，一声不响，仿佛她在我到来之前，就已经知道我要来。我在她身旁坐下来，她朝我的眼睛凝视片刻，深深长叹了一口气，然后把目光转向遥远的晚霞，那里正是夜首与日尾相互嬉戏的地方。一阵将我们的心灵纳入无形灵魂行列的神秘寂静过后，赛勒玛把脸转向我，伸出冰冷、颤抖的手拉住我的手，用类似于饥饿得说不出话来的人的呻吟似的声音说：

“朋友，你瞧瞧我的脸，好好地瞧一瞧，细细地看一看，读一读你想用语言了解关于我的一切情况吧……亲爱的，你看看我的脸……哥哥，你好好瞧一瞧吧！”

我瞧着她的脸，久久地注视了一番，发现几天前她那还像嘴一样微笑和像鸟翅膀扇动的眼睛已经凹陷下去，而且呆滞僵死，蒙上了一层痛苦、忧虑的阴影；她那昨天还像高高兴兴接受太阳神亲吻的白百合花瓣似的皮肤已经枯黄，盖上了一层绝望的面纱；她的双唇本来像延命菊花，甜汁四溢，如今已经干枯，活像秋风下留在枝头上瑟瑟抖动的两片玫瑰；她的脖颈原先像象牙柱子一样挺立着，如今已经向前弯曲，仿佛再也无力承受头脑里的沉重负担。

我看到了赛勒玛脸上这些令人痛苦的变化，但所有这些在我看来不过是薄云遮月，使月亮显得更加美丽、壮观、庄严。脸上所透露出来的精神深处的秘密，无论其多么令人痛苦难过，都会使面容更加妩媚、甜润；而那些默不作声，不肯吐露内心隐情和秘密的面孔，无论其线条多么流畅，五官如何端正，也谈不上什么美丽。酒杯只有晶莹透明，全呈美酒色泽，才能吸引我们的双唇。那天黄昏，赛勒玛正像一只盛满纯酒的杯子，生活的苦汁与心灵的甘甜相互掺杂在酒之中。赛勒玛在不知不觉中演示了东方妇女的生活：刚告别父亲的家，便使自己的脖颈套在了粗鲁丈夫的枷锁之下；才离开慈祥母亲的怀抱，就生活在残暴婆母的奴役之中。

我目不转睛地凝视着赛勒玛的面孔，静听着她那断断续续的呼吸声，默默地思考着，和她一起感到痛苦，为她感到难过。我终于感到时间停下了脚步，万物被遮挡起来，渐而消失，只看见两只大眼睛在凝神注视着我的内心世界，只觉得我双手捧着的那只冰冷的手在不住地颤抖，直到赛勒玛平静，用她那从容的话音说话时，我才从这种昏迷中苏醒过来。她说：

“来吧，朋友，我们现在谈谈吧！趁未来还没有把艰难险阻加在我们的头上，让我们描绘、勾勒一下我们的未来吧！我父亲已到那个将成为我终身伴侣的男人家去了。上天选定的导致我出生的男人去见大地注定的成为主宰我的末日的男子了。就在本城的中心，伴我度过青春时代的老人正在会见将伴我度过其余岁月的青年。今天夜里，父亲与未婚夫商定结婚日期；无论那一天多么遥远，终将是很近的。这个时刻是多么奇异，它的影响又是何等强烈！上星期的今夜，就在这素馨花树荫下，爱神第一次拥抱了我的灵魂；也在同一时刻，天命在保罗·伽里卜大主教宅里，写下了我未来故事的第一句话。此时此刻，我父亲和我的未婚夫正在编织我的结婚花环。我看见你坐在我的身边，我感得到你的心潮在我的周围波涌起伏，像一只干渴的鸟儿，拍翅盘旋在一条可怕的饥饿毒蛇把守着的清泉上空。这一夜是多么重要，其奥秘又是何等深刻！”

在我的想象中，绝望就像漆黑的魔影，狠狠地掐住了我们爱情的喉咙，一心将之扼死在童年之中。我回答她说：

“这只鸟将一直盘飞在清泉上空，不是渴得坠地而死，就是被可怕的毒蛇扑住，并被撕烂吞食。”

赛勒玛激动不已，话音像银弦一样颤动地说：

“不，不，我的朋友，还是让鸟儿活着，让这只夜莺一直唱到夜幕垂降，直到春天过去，世界毁灭，时光衰竭。你不要让它哑口，因为它的声音能使我复活；不要让它的翅膀停止拍击，因为羽翼的沙沙响声能躯散我心中的雾霭。”

我叹息着低声说：

“赛勒玛呀，它会渴死的，也会被吓死的。”

话语从她那颤动的双唇间奔腾倾泻而出，她回答道：

“灵魂的干渴要比物质的渴望更重要，心灵的的恐惧要比肉体的安宁更可怕……不过，亲爱的，请你好好听我说。我现在站在一种新生活的门口，而我对之一无所知。我就像一个盲人，因为怕跌倒，所以用手摸着墙行走。我是一个女奴，父亲的钱财将我推到了奴隶市场上，一个男子把我买去了。我不爱这个男子，因为我对他一无所知。你也知道，爱情与陌生是不相容的。但是，我将要学着爱他。我将顺从他，为他效力，使他幸福。我将把一个懦弱女人能够献给一个强悍男子的东西全部献给他。至于你嘛，你则正处于青春少年，你面前的生活之路是宽广的，而且满铺鲜花和香草。你将带着你那颗炽燃的心走向宽阔世界。你将自由地思想，自由地说话，自由地做事。你将把自己的名字写在生命的面颊上，因为你是一名顶天立地的男子汉。你将像主人一样生活，因为你父亲穷，所以你不会成为奴隶，不会因为他那点家财而被带往买卖女奴的奴隶市场上。你将与一个心爱的姑娘结为伴侣；在她过门之前，她会先占据你的心房；在与你朝夕相处之前，她就会与你同思共想。”

赛勒玛说到这里，稍稍沉默，喘口气，然后用哽咽的声音说：

“可是，难道就在这里，生活之路就将我们分开，让你奔向男子的光荣，让我去尽妇道义务？莫非美梦就这样结束了？莫非甜蜜的现实就这样云消雾散了？难道喧嚣就这样将鸟的鸣啭吞噬？难道狂风就这样将玫瑰花瓣吹散？莫非粗脚就这样将酒杯踏碎？难道让我们站在朗月下的那一夜是假的？难道我们的灵魂相聚在这素馨花树下也是假的？难道我们急忙飞向星星，翅膀感到疲惫，将我们一下抛入深渊？莫非爱神在沉睡中突然来到我们身边，顷刻醒来大怒要惩罚我们？难道我的呼吸触怒了夜间的微风，使之顷刻之间化为狂飙，意欲撕裂我们，将我们碾作尘埃，然后卷入谷底？我们既没有违背叮嘱，也没有偷食禁果，为什么要把我们驱逐出伊甸园呢？我们既没有玩弄阴谋，也不曾背叛，为什么要把我们打入地狱呢？不能，不能啊！一千个不能，一万个不该！我们相聚的片刻胜似数个世纪；照亮我们心灵的光芒足以征服任何黑暗。假若风暴在这个愤怒的海面上将我们分开，那么，波涛会在那个平静的海岸将我们聚在一起；倘使这种生活将我们杀死，那么，那位死神会使我们复活。

“女人的心是不会跟时间而变化，随季节而更替的。女人的心会久久挣扎，但却不会死亡。女人的心颇似旷野，人将之当作战地和沙场，拔掉那里的树木，烧掉那里的青草，用血染红那里的岩石，将尸骨的头颅栽入土地中；尽管如此，旷野依旧存在，寂静安详，春天照样按时而至，秋天仍然硕果压枝，直到永远……如今事情结束了，我们怎么办呢？请你告诉我，我们该怎么办？我们怎样分手，何时相聚？莫非我们应把爱神视作异乡客，夜幕将之送来，清晨又将之赶走？难道我们该将心里的情感看成一个梦，睡觉时才显示，苏醒后去而无踪？莫非我们应该把这一个礼拜看作烂醉时刻，顷刻便已清醒？……亲爱的，你抬起头来呀，让我听听你的声音！你说话呀！请你开口跟我说话呀！狂风吹翻我们的船后，你还记得我们共度的那些日子吗？寂静的夜里，你听见我的翅膀沙沙拍击声吗？你能感觉到我呼出的气在你的脸面和脖颈上波涌起伏吗？你能听到我痛苦哽咽的低微叹息声吗？你能看见我的幻影随黑夜幻影而来，又随晨雾消失吗？亲爱的，你对我说呀！你曾是我眼中的光明，耳中的歌声，灵魂的翅膀，以后你将是什么呢？”

我的心底之蕴全部融在我的双目之中。我回答她说：

“赛勒玛，我将像你希望的那样属于你。”

她说：

“我希望你爱我。我要你爱我到我的末日。我要你像诗人爱自己的痛苦忧思一样爱我。我要你像旅行者记起水塘那样记起我；看见水塘先借水面照照自己的容颜，然后再俯首饮水。我要你像母亲记起胎儿那样记起我；胎儿未见到光明，便死在了母腹之中。我要你像慈悲的国王想到囚犯那样想到我；囚犯未接到国王的赦免令便死在了牢里。我希望你成为我的兄弟、朋友和伙伴。我希望你常来看望我的父亲，给孤独中的他送来欢乐和慰藉，因为我不久就要离开他，变成他的陌生人。”

我回答她说：

“赛勒玛，我将一一照办。我将使我的灵魂包裹你的灵魂，让我的心成为容纳你的俊美的房舍，让我的胸腔成为掩埋你的痛苦的坟墓。赛勒玛，我将像田野酷爱春天那样爱你；我将像鲜花靠太阳光和热生长那样靠你而生活下去；我将像山谷吟诵回荡在农村教堂上空的钟声那样吟咏你的名字；我将像海岸聆听波涛讲故事那样倾听你心灵的絮语……赛勒玛，我将像寂寞的异乡客思念亲爱的祖国那样思恋你；我将像饥饿的穷苦人向往一桌美食那样向往你；我将像被废黜的君王暗恋尊荣、辉煌岁月，垂头丧气的俘虏暗恋自由、安详时光那样暗恋你；我将像农夫想着抱抱禾穗和打谷场上的粮堆，善良的牧人想着肥美草原和甘甜泉水那样想着你。”

我说话时，赛勒玛一直望着夜幕深处，不时地叹叹气。她的心跳时快时慢，如同大海波涛时高时低。她说：

“明天，事实就要化为幻影，苏醒就会变成幻梦。思念者只靠拥抱幻影，干渴者仅饮梦中溪水，这能够满足要求吗？”

我回答道：

“明天，天命就要把你带到一个充满温馨与平静的家庭怀抱中，将你带到一个充满斗争、厮杀的世界里去了。你就要到一个男子家中去了，他会为你的俊秀容貌、纯洁心灵而感到幸福；而我，则要到岁月的埋伏的地点去，岁月将以其痛苦折磨我，用它那可怕的魔影恫吓我。你将投入生活怀抱，我却要进入争执天地。你迎来的将是亲昵与温馨，我面临的却是孤独与寂寞。不过，我将在死神阴影遮罩的山谷里竖起爱神的塑像，天天对之顶礼膜拜。我将与爱神夜下谈心，听她唱吟，将她当作美酒痛饮，把她选作衣服穿在身上。拂晓，爱神把我从睡梦中唤醒，领着我走向遥远的旷野；正午，爱神将把我带到树荫下，与百鸟一起回避烈日灼热，欢快乘凉；黄昏，爱神让我面对日落之地，让我聆听大自然告别光明时唱的歌，让我观赏寂静的幻影遨游在空中的壮景；夜晚，爱神拥抱着我，我安然进入梦乡，梦游情侣、诗人灵魂居住的天堂。春天里，我与爱神并肩漫步，踏着生命用紫罗兰和延命菊画出的足迹，用水仙花和百合花杯喝着剩余的甘霖，在丘山和坡地之间欣然吟唱；夏天里，我与爱神头枕干草捆，下铺青草作褥，上盖蓝天当被，与月亮、星辰亲切夜谈；秋天里，我将与爱神一起去葡萄园，坐在榨汁机旁，观看正在脱掉金黄色衣裳的树木，仰望向海岸迁徙的鸟群；冬天里，我将与爱神相互依偎在炉火旁，讲述历代故事，重温各国与各民族的史迹。青年时代，爱情将成为我的导师；中年时代，爱神将成为我的助手；老年时代，爱神将成为我的慰藉。赛勒玛，爱神将伴随我终生，直至大限来临，你我相聚上帝手中。”

语词发自我的心灵深处，语速急促，就像一柄柄火炬，火焰熊熊，火星四溅，旋即零落消失在花园的角落里。赛勒玛聆听着，泪水夺眶而出，簌簌下落，眼帘仿佛变成了双唇，泪流便是回答我的话语。

没有得到爱神赐予的双翅的人们，是不能飞到云天外观看那个神奇世界的，也看不到我和赛勒玛的灵魂在那悲欢交集的时刻遨游在那个世界里的情景。没有被爱神选作旅伴的人们，他们是听不见爱神说话的，这个故事也不是写给他们的；即使他们能够明白这几页书的意思，他们也看不到蹒跚在字里行间的不以墨水为衣、不把白纸当作宿身之处的幻影。可是，谁又未曾啜饮过爱神林中的玉液呢？哪个心灵又未曾恭恭敬敬地站在用心之底蕴铺地，以秘密、美梦和情感盖顶的光明神殿之前呢？哪一朵花的花瓣没有沾过晨露？哪条迷路溪水没有奔向大海？

赛勒玛抬起头来，倾望着繁星点缀着的夜空，两手伸向前，双目圆瞪，双唇颤动，蜡黄色的脸上呈现出一位受虐待女子心灵中的全部怨恨、绝望和痛苦征兆，然后大声喊道：

“主啊，女人有何过错，致使你大发雷霆？她又何罪之有，招来你发怒到地老天荒？莫非她犯下了可怕的无穷弥天大罪，致使你给我无尽的惩罚？主啊，你是强大无比的，而女人则是软弱无力的，你为什么要用痛苦消灭她？主啊，你是伟大的，而女人只是在你的宝座周围匍匐爬行，你为什么要用双脚将之踏碎？主啊，你是强烈暴风，而女人在你面前，则像尘埃，你为什么要把她卷扬到冰雪上去呢？主啊，你是巨神，而女人则是不幸者，你为什么要同她作战？主啊，你明察秋毫，无所不知，而女人则是迷途的盲者，你为什么要置之于死地？主啊，你用爱创生了女人，又为什么要用爱将之消灭？主啊，你用右手将女人举到你的身旁，你又为什么用左手将之抛入深渊，而她全然不知你何时将之举起，又怎样将之抛掉？你把生的气息吹入女人的口中，却又将死亡的种子播入女人的心田。主啊，是你使她走在幸福路上，旋即又派不幸骑士来抓她。主啊，是你把欢乐的歌声送入她的喉咙，然后却用痛苦封住她的双唇，用愁苦拴住她的舌头。主啊，你用你那无形的手指将欢乐与她的痛苦系在一起，又用你那有形的手指在她的欢乐周围画上痛苦的光晕。你把宽舒和平安隐藏在她的卧室里，却又把恐惧和麻烦置于她的床边。你用你的意志唤醒了她的爱慕之情，而从她的爱慕之情中又生出了她的毛病与过失。你用你的意愿让她看到了你的造化之美，你也用你的意愿使她对美的钟爱化为致命的饥饿。你用你的法律使她的灵魂与漂亮肉体结配，你也用你的法则使她的肉体做了软弱和屈辱的伴侣。主啊，你用死亡之杯为她注入生命，又用生命之杯为她注入死亡。主啊，你用她的泪水为她洗净，又用她的泪水将她溶解。主啊，你用男人的面饼填充饥腹，然后又用她的心中情感塞满男人的手。主啊，你呀，你用爱情打开了我的眼界，用爱情使我永远双眼失明。主啊，你用你的双唇亲吻了我，又用有力的手给了我一记耳光。你在我的心中种下了白玫瑰，却又在玫瑰周围令荆棘、芒刺横生。主啊，你用一个我所深爱的青年的灵魂绑住了我的魂，却又用一个我素不相识的男人的身束住了我的身。主啊，你羁绊了我的岁月！主啊，帮我一把吧，让我成为这场殊死斗争中的强者；救救我吧，让我至死忠诚、纯洁……主啊，愿你如愿以偿！愿你的圣名永远吉祥！”

赛勒玛沉默下来，而她的面容还在说话。之后，她低下头，垂下双臂，弯下腰，仿佛失去了活力；在我看来，她就像被狂风摧折的树枝，被抛在低洼地，任其干枯，自消自灭在时光的脚下。我用我灼热的双手捧住她那冰凉的手，用我的眼帘和双唇亲吻她的手指。当我想用话语安慰她时，发现我自己比她更值得安慰和同情。我沉默无言，不知所措，静静思考，感到时光在拿我的情感开玩笑，听到我的心在我胸腔里呻吟，不由自主地自己对自己担忧起来。

在那一夜余下的时间里，我俩谁都没说一句话。因为焦虑一旦巨大，人便会变得哑口无言。我俩一直默不作声，僵直地待在那里，活像被地震埋入土中的一对大理石柱。谁也不想听对方说话，因为我俩的心弦都已脆弱无比，即使不说话，一声叹息也会震断它。

午夜时分，寂静得阴森可怕。残月从萨尼山后升起，在繁星中间，显得就像一张埋在灵床的黑色枕头里的白苍苍的死人的脸，在四周的微弱烛光映照下尤为令人心惊。黎巴嫩山脉像被岁月压弯脊背、被苦难扭曲身骨的老翁一样，眼里没有困意，与黑夜谈天，等待黎明到来，颇似一位被废黜的君王，坐在宫殿废墟间的宝座灰烬上。高山、树木和河流随着情况和时间的变化而变换着自己的形态与外表，就像人的面容一样随着思想和情感的变化而变化。白天里高高挺立的白杨树就像娇媚的新娘子，微风戏动着她那长长的衣裙，然而到了夜晚，它却像一根烟柱，高高插入无垠的天空。午间像强有力的藐视一切灾难的暴君一般的巨大岩石，在夜里却变得像一个可怜的穷光蛋，只有以大地当褥，盖着夜空作被。我们清晨看到的溪流波光粼粼，如同银色的蜜汁，耳闻它欢唱着永恒之歌；及至傍晚，它却像从山谷半腰淌泻下来的泪河，耳听它在像失子的母亲痛哭、哀号。一个星期以前，黎巴嫩山脉还是那样威严、壮观，其时皓月当空，人心欢畅；而那一夜里，它却变得愁眉苦脸，萎靡不振，面对着徘徊在夜空的暗淡残月和一颗悸动在胸中的怏怏之心，显得那样寂寞孤独。

我们站起身来告别时，爱情和失望像两个可怕的魔影横在我俩之间：前者展开翅膀在我们的头上盘旋，而后者则用魔爪掐住了我们的喉咙；前者惊惶地哭泣，后者却讥讽地大笑。当我捧起赛勒玛的手放在我的双唇上亲吻、祝福时，她靠近我，吻了吻我的头发分缝处，然后坐在木椅上，合上眼，缓缓地低声说：

“主啊，求你怜悯！求你让所有被折断的翅膀强健起来吧！”

我离开赛勒玛，走出花园，只觉得我的感官被罩上了一层厚厚的纱幕，酷似雾霭在湖面弥漫。我独自走去，道路两旁的树影在我面前晃动，就像从地缝里钻出来的魔影在故意吓我。微弱的月光在树枝间瑟瑟颤抖，活似遨游在天空的妖魔向我的胸膛射来的一支支细长的利箭。我的周围一片沉寂，仿佛是黑暗之神捂在我身上的沉重黑色巨掌。

那时，存在中的一切，生活的全部意义，心灵里的所有秘密，都变得丑陋、可怕与骇人听闻。世间的美和存在的欢乐让我看到的精神之光，已经化为火，其烈焰灼烧着我的心肝，其烟雾笼罩着我的心灵。万物之声汇成的并使之成为天国之歌的合声，一时间化为比狮吼更加令人恐惧、比深渊呐喊更加深沉的啸鸣。

我回到自己的卧室，一下便瘫倒在了床上，就像被猎人射中的鸟儿，心被箭穿透，直坠落在篱笆之间。我的理智一直摇摆在可怕的苏醒与不安的睡梦之间；在这两种情况下，我的灵魂都在重复着赛勒玛的那些话：“主啊，求你怜悯！求你让所有被折断的翅膀强健起来吧！”

死神宝座前


婚姻，在我们这个时代是一桩可笑又可悲的交易，完全被男青年和姑娘们的父亲们所包揽。在这场交易中，多数地方的男青年们赢利，父亲们赔钱，而被当作货物从一家移入另一家的姑娘们，则欢乐尽失，如同旧家具一样，她们就被放在房舍的角落里，面对黑暗，慢慢地消亡。

现代文明使妇女的意识稍有长进，但却因为男子们的贪婪之心普遍化，因而妇女们的痛苦有增无减。往昔，妇女是幸福的女仆；如今，她们变成了不幸的女主人。往昔，她们是走在白日光明之中的盲人；如今，她们却成了走在夜幕中的明眼人。过去，妇女们因无知而显得妩媚，因朴实而显得娴淑，因懦弱而显得强壮；如今，她们因娇美而变得丑陋，因敏感而变得肤浅，因知事而变得远离人心。她们能有一日变得美貌与知识、妖丽与德高、身材苗条与心灵坚强于一身吗？我认为精神升华是人类的法则，渐臻完美是一条缓慢的规律，但它却是一条积极有效的规律。假若妇女在某件事上前进了，而在另一件事上落后了，那是因为登上山顶的路上有障碍，那里不乏贼窝和狼穴。在这座类似于苏醒前的昏厥的山中，在这座布满过去时代泥土和未来数代种子的山中，在这充满奇异嗜好和愿望的山中，不乏这样一座城市，那里的妇女正是未来女子的象征。赛勒玛在贝鲁特将是东方新女性的代表，但她像许多生活在以前时代的人一样，成了新时代的牺牲品，就像被急流卷走的一朵花，被迫走向不幸前进的行列中。

曼苏尔贝克与赛勒玛结了婚，二人住在贝鲁特海滨的一座豪宅里，那是个社会名流、富翁聚居的区域。法里斯老人独自待在那座孤零零的住宅中，周围是花圃、果园，酷似牧羊人守着一群羊。喜筵日子过去了，洞房花烛之夜过去了，被人们称为“蜜月”的日子也过去了，留下来的便是醋酸加苦西瓜汁的日子，正像战争的显赫与辉煌，留下来的却是战死者的头颅和尸骨，横布在旷野之上……东方婚礼的豪华讲究把青年男女的心灵高高抛向天空，就像雄鹰展翅高翔云端，然后又把他们像磨盘一样丢入海底，简直就像沙滩上留下的足迹，顷刻便被浪潮抹掉。

春去夏至，接着便是金秋。我对赛勒玛的美渐而从一个青春少年对一位黄花少女的慕恋，变成一种孤儿对长眠地下的母亲英灵的无声崇拜。曾经占据我的整个身心的钟爱之情，变成了顾影自怜的盲目忧伤；曾使我热泪脱眶而出的酷恋之情，已经化为令我心滴鲜血的沮丧；曾充满我胸间的思恋呻吟之声，变成了深沉的祈祷。在寂静中，我的灵魂向苍天祈祷，祈求苍天给予赛勒玛以幸福，赐予她的丈夫以快活，让她的父亲放心。不过，我同情也好，祈祷、祝福也好，统统都是徒劳无益的。因为赛勒玛的不幸是心病，只有死神才能治愈它。她的丈夫则属于那样一种人：不费吹灰之力，便可得到一切，使生活过得舒适、宽裕、快乐，但决不会以此为满足，还常贪图得到本来不属于他们自己的东西；就这样，他们一直受着他们的贪欲折磨，直到生命尽头。我希望法里斯老人放心也是没有用的，因为他的女婿刚刚娶了他的女儿，得到了她的大笔钱财，便把老人忘得一干二净，对他弃之不理，一心只盼他一命呜呼，好把他剩余的财产全部弄到自己手里。

曼苏尔贝克很像他的叔父保罗·伽里卜大主教。他的性格也像叔父。曼苏尔贝克的心灵简直就是其叔父心灵的缩影。他叔侄俩之间只是伪善与堕落之别。大主教在他的紫色教服掩饰下实现自己的意愿，借悬挂在胸前那闪着金光的十字架满足自己的贪欲。而他的侄子，则是明目张胆、肆无忌惮地为所欲为。清晨，大主教去教堂；白日的其余时间里，他则去榨取寡母孤儿、平民百姓的钱财。曼苏尔贝克整天都在被腐朽气息污染透的阴暗的花街柳巷纵情酒色。

星期日，大主教站在祭坛前，一本正经地向信民们宣讲他自己并不遵守的训诫；而在一周里的其余日子里，他就忙于国家政治活动。他的侄子，则利用叔父的权势，把全部时光打发在与那些求职者和追求名利者的交易上。大主教是一个在夜幕掩盖下行窃的小偷，而曼苏尔贝克则是光天化日之下大摇大摆行走的骗子。

百姓就这样在这伙小偷和骗子之间惨死，就像群羊在狼的利爪和屠刀下丧命。东方各民族就这样屈从于心术不正、道德败坏之辈，于是渐而倒退，然后坠入深渊，时代匆匆而过，用其脚将之踏烂，就像铁链一样将陶器砸得粉碎……

究竟是什么让我用这么大篇幅来谈悲惨、绝望的民族呢？我本想记下一位不幸女子的故事，描绘一颗悲伤的、尚未尝到爱情的欢乐便惨遭痛苦打击的心灵……想到那位未曾拥抱过生活便被死神夺去生命的弱女子，我已不再流泪，却为什么谈起遭受压迫的无名百姓，我却泪水夺眶而出呢？难道那位弱女子不正是受压迫人们的象征吗？那位在心灵爱好与肉体桎梏之间痛苦挣扎的女子，不正像在统治者与祭司们之间受折磨的民族吗？或者说那种将一位美丽少女带往坟墓阴暗处的无形情感，不正像用黄土掩埋百姓生命的强烈暴风吗？女人之于民族，如同光之于油灯：若灯油充足，那灯光会微弱昏暗吗？

秋天过去了，金风剥光的树木，戏动着飘飞的黄叶，如同飓风戏耍着海水的泡沫。冬天哭号着走来。我在贝鲁特没有一个伙伴，伴随我的只有梦，时而将我的心灵高高抬往星空，时而又将我的心降下埋入地腹。

愁苦的心灵只有在孤寂中安宁，于是远离人们，就像受伤的羚羊离群而去，隐藏在山洞里，或者得到痊愈，或者默默死去。

有一天，我听说法里斯老人病了，我便放弃了独处，前往探望他。我躲开被车水马龙嘈杂声干扰长空静寂的大道，沿着橄榄树之间的一条小道步行而去。但见橄榄树那铅灰色的叶子上因雨滴而闪闪放光。

行至老人家，我走进门一看，只见老人躺在床上，身体瘦弱，面容憔悴，脸色蜡黄，双目深陷在双眉下，活像两个又深又暗的窟窿，病痛的魔影在那里游荡。昔日那曾经容光焕发、笑颜常驻的舒展面孔，如今紧缩着，愁眉不展，像一张皱皱巴巴的铅灰色纸，仿佛疾病在上面留下的一行行模模糊糊的奇怪字样。昔日那双温暖、柔软的手，如今已变成皮包骨头，瘦弱不堪，活像暴风中瑟瑟抖动的光秃秃的树枝。

我走近老人，问他近日可好。他把清瘦的脸转向我，颤抖的双唇上绽现出一丝凄凉的微微笑意，用似乎是从墙后传来的微弱声音说：

“去吧，孩子，到那个房间里去吧！给赛勒玛擦擦眼泪，让她平静一些，然后再把她带到这里来，让她坐在我的床边……”

我走进对面那个房间，发现赛勒玛瘫坐在一张椅子上，双手抱着头，脸埋在椅背上，屏着呼吸，以免父亲听到她的泣哭声。我缓步走近她，用近乎叹息的微弱低声呼唤她的名字。她就像被恶梦惊扰的睡梦中的人一样，惶遽地一动，随即坐正，用呆滞的目光望着我，仿佛她是在梦中看到了一个幻影，不相信是我站在那个地方。

一阵深深的沉默，仿佛它的神奇影响将我们带回到我们醉于神酒的时刻。之后，赛勒玛用指尖抹去眼泪，伤心地说：

“你看到岁月如何更替了吗？你看见时光怎样使我们迷失方向，我们又如何快步走进了这可怕洞窟了吗？就在这个地方，春天将我们聚集在了爱神的掌中；还是在这里，严冬又让我们在死神的宝座前见面。白日是多么灿烂，而这夜色又是多么黑暗……”

话未说完，她哽咽了。随后，她又用双手捂住自己的脸，仿佛往事已浮现在她的面前，而她却不想看到它。我用手抚摩着她的头发，说：

“来吧，赛勒玛，来吧！让我们在狂飙前像铁塔一样巍然屹立吧！来吧，赛勒玛，让我们在敌人面前像勇士一样挺立，用我们的胸膛，而不是用脊背迎着敌人的刀锋剑刃吧！我们倒下去，要像烈士那样壮烈；我们得胜时，要像英雄那样活着……在艰难困苦面前，坚定地忍受心灵上的折磨，总比退缩到安全、舒适的地方要高尚。在油灯四周拍翅扑火，直到化为灰烬的蛾子，要比在黑暗洞穴里平安、舒适生活的鼹鼠要尊贵。不经受冬令严寒和各种因素考验的种子，是不能够破土而出，快快活活地饱尝四月的美景的……赛勒玛，来吧！让我们迈着坚定的步伐，在这条崎岖小路上前进吧！我们要抬眼望着太阳，以免看见散落在乱石中的骷髅和穿行在荆棘之间的毒蛇。假若恐惧会使我们在半路上站下来，黑夜里的幻影就会让我们听到奚落和嘲讽的呐喊声；如果我们勇敢地登上山顶，宇宙的灵魂就会与我们一道同唱欢乐凯歌……赛勒玛，你不要难过，不要悲伤，擦干眼泪，拂去脸上的愁云。起来，让我们坐在你父亲的床边，因为他的生命就是你的生命，你的微微笑容能使他病愈康复。”

她用充满温情、怜悯的目光望了我一眼，然后说：

“你的两眼里饱含失意、绝望之情，怎能要求我忍耐坚强呢？一个饥饿之人能把自己的面饼让给另一饥民吗？一个急需药品的病夫能将自己的药给另一病人吗？”

说罢，赛勒玛站起来，然后低着头向她父亲的卧室走去，我紧随其后。我俩坐在老人的病榻旁，赛勒玛强作欢颜，竭力佯装平静，老人也装作快慰、强壮的模样，然而彼此都能感受到对方痛苦的脆弱，也能听到对方的心灵在呻吟。父女俩就像是两种彼此相似的力量，正在寂静之中相互消亡着。父亲已病入膏盲，因可怜女儿的不幸而更趋衰竭；女儿深爱父亲，因眼见父亲临危而由衷痛苦。一颗即将告别人世的心与一颗完全绝望的心，在爱神和死神的面前相互拥抱在一起。此时此刻，我被夹在两颗心中间，心中感到无比悲哀，深切体会到那两颗心中的忧苦。天命之手把三个人聚集在一起，尔后又用力紧攥，直至将他们捏碎：老人像一座被洪流冲垮的老房子；姑娘好像一朵被镰刀砍断枝茎的百合花；还有一个青年，就像被大雪压弯了腰的幼苗。我们都像是天命之手中的玩具。

这时，老人在被窝里动了动，然后把瘦骨嶙峋、青筋凸露的手伸向赛勒玛，声音里充满一位父亲心中的全部慈祥和温情，同时饱含一个病人的所有疾苦与病痛，说道：

“赛勒玛，让爸爸攥攥你的手。”

赛勒玛伸过手去，让父亲攥住。老人温情地攥着女儿的手，说：

“孩子，对过去的日子，我感到心满意足，我活了这么大年纪，品尝过了四季鲜果，尝尽了日夜带来的欢乐。少年时代，我曾扑蝶戏耍；青年时代，我曾拥抱爱神；人到中年，我集聚起万贯家财。

在人生的各个阶段，我都是那样快乐、欢娱。赛勒玛，你母亲辞世时，你还未满三岁，但她却能把你当作珍宝留给了我。你像新月那样迅速长大，你母亲的容貌反映在你的脸上，就像星光倒映在平静的水池中。你母亲的品性和道德，见于你的言行里，就像透过薄纱能看见金饰一样。孩子，有你已足以使我深得慰藉，因为你像你母亲一样俊秀、聪颖……如今，我已成年迈老翁，老人们将在死神的温柔翅膀下得以安息。孩子，你不要难过！因为爸爸活着已看见你长成了一个漂亮的大姑娘。孩子，你该高兴呀！因为我死后仍然以你而活着。我现在就走与明天或后天走都是一样的。因为我们的岁月就像秋天的黄叶，将在太阳下飘落飞撒。假若时辰迅速带我奔向永恒世界，那是因为它知道我的灵魂迫切期望与你的母亲相见……”

老人用充满恋情与希望的甘甜语调说出那后几句话，忧虑密布的脸上闪烁着童子眼中闪现出来的亮光。他伸手从头旁边的靠枕间掏出一帧嵌在金边镜框中的小幅旧肖像，那镜框的四边因手掌常触摸而变得光滑闪亮，边框上的花纹也被唇吻得模糊不清。老人目不转睛地望着肖像，说：

“孩子，靠近我一点儿，我让你看看你母亲的影像，看看她留在这张相纸上的倩影。”

赛勒玛靠近父亲，父亲擦去她眼角的泪水，以免防碍她看见那帧模模糊糊的肖像。她久久凝视着，仿佛那是一面镜子，照出了她的精神和面容。之后，她把肖像贴近双唇，热切地吻了又吻，然后大声喊道：

“妈！妈妈！妈妈！”

她没说别的，随后又把肖像放在她那颤抖的双唇上，仿佛她想用她那灼热的气息让母亲复活似的……

人的双唇能够说出的最甜蜜的字眼，便是“母亲”，最美的呼唤声，那就是“妈妈”。“妈妈”，这是一个简单而意义却深广无比的字眼，其中充满着希望、慈爱、怜悯和人的心灵中所有亲密、甘甜和美好的情感。在人的生命中，母亲就是一切：悲伤时，母亲是慰藉；沮丧时，母亲是希望；软弱时，母亲是力量，母亲是同情、怜悯、慈爱、宽恕的源泉。失去母亲的人，便失去了自己的头所依靠的胸膛，失去了为自己祝福的手，失去了守护自己的眼睛……

大自然界的一切，无不象征着和谈论着母性。太阳乃大地之母，以自己的热孕育大地，用自己的光拥抱大地。傍晚，太阳用海浪低吟、百鸟鸣啭和溪水的歌声将大地送入梦乡之后，自己方才离去。大地是万木百花之母，是大地生养了它们，待它们长大之后才断奶。万木百花又是香甜果实和生机勃勃的种子的母亲。而宇宙间一切存在的母亲，则是那充满美和爱的无始无终、永恒不灭的绝对精神。

赛勒玛不认识自己的母亲，因为母亲去世时她还很小。当她看见母亲的肖像时，激动之情难抑，情不自禁地大声呼叫“妈妈”。因为“妈妈”这个字眼藏在我们的心中，就像果核埋在地心里；在我们悲伤、欢乐之时，就会从我们唇间迸发出来，就像玫瑰花香不论晴雨都会由芳蕊洒露。

赛勒玛眷恋凝视着母亲的肖像，热切地亲吻，然后将之紧贴在她那激烈起伏的胸脯上，然后叹息起来，随着每一声的叹息，她的力量便失去一部分。终于，她那消瘦的体躯里失去了活力，瘫倒在父亲的病榻旁。老人双手抚摩着她的头，说：

“孩子，我已让你从这相片上看到了你母亲的影像。现在，你就听我把她的话讲给你听吧！”

赛勒玛抬起头，酷似巢中的雏鸟听到母鸟双翅在树枝间扇动的声音时那样，望着父亲，凝神细听，仿佛她的整个身心都变成了凝视的眼睛和聪慧的耳朵。

父亲说：

“你还是个吃奶的婴儿时，你的母亲便失去了她的老父亲。她为你外公的亡故而悲伤，她像一个坚忍的有理智的人那样哭泣。但是，她刚从你外公的坟上回到家中，便在这个房间里，坐在我的身旁，双手捧着我的手，说：‘法里斯，我的父亲走了，我也就只有你了；有你在，就是我的慰藉。多情善感的心，就像枝杈繁盛的杉树，一条健壮枝杈失去了，杉树会感到疼痛，但不会死去，而是把自己的活力转到旁边的枝杈上，使之成长、壮大，继之用茂盛的嫩叶遮盖住被遮断的枝杈留下伤疤。’孩子，这就是你母亲痛失你外公之时所说的话。赛勒玛，这也是死神把我的躯体投入宁静的墓穴中和把我的灵魂引向上帝那里之时，你应该说的话。”

赛勒玛悲痛欲绝，说道：

“母亲失去了自己的父亲，还有你留在她的身边，而我一旦失去了你，我的身边还有谁呢？外公辞别了人间，母亲得到了一位诚心待她的忠诚、高尚的丈夫的庇护；此外，还有一个婴儿用小脑袋拱蹭她的奶子，用小胳膊搂抱她的脖子。可是，我一旦失去了你，爸爸，还有谁和我在一起呢？爸爸，你不但是我的父亲，也是我的母亲，是我少年时代的伙伴，又是我青年时代的良师益友；你若离去，谁又能替代得了你呢？”

说完，赛勒玛用噙着泪花的眼睛望着我，又用右手拉住我的衣角，说：

“爸爸，我只有这么一位朋友，别无他伴。你离我去时，他像我一样饱受着折磨，我能从他这里得到安慰吗？一个心已碎裂的人，怎么可能去抚慰一颗碎裂的心呢？一位悲伤的女子，也绝对承受不住邻居的悲伤，同样，鸽子不能用被折断了的翅膀飞翔。他是我心灵的伙伴，但我的忧伤使他肩负重担，把他的腰压弯了。我的泪水模糊了他的双眼，使他看到的只有一片黑暗。他是兄弟，我爱他，他也爱我；但他和所有兄弟一样，只能与我共同承受灾难，却无力减轻之；只能以哭泣相助，使泪水更苦涩，令心中火更盛。”

我听着赛勒玛的话，难抑情绪激动，胸口憋闷，只觉得肋骨几乎要崩裂，化成无数喉咙和嘴巴，老人则望着她，他那瘦弱的体躯在靠枕和褥垫之间缓慢下滑，疲惫的心灵在颤抖，活像风中残烛。他张开双臂，平静地说：

“让我平平安安地走吧，孩子！我的双目已看到云外田地，我不会把眼光移离那些仙洞。让我飞走吧，我已用翅膀打碎了牢笼的栅栏……你母亲已在呼唤我，赛勒玛！你不要阻拦我……看哪，海面上风平雾散，船已张起风帆，准备起航了！你不要阻止船起航，不要夺船舵。让我的体躯与那些长眠的人一起安息，让我的灵魂苏醒吧！因为黎明已经到来，幻梦已经结束……用你的灵魂亲吻我的灵魂吧……给我一个饱含希望的亲吻，不要把一滴苦汁洒在我的身上，以免妨碍百花和香草从我身上吸取营养成分。不要把失望的泪珠滴在我的手上，因为它会在我的坟墓上生出荆棘；不要把悲伤的叹息画在我的前额上，因为黎明的微风吹来看见那画痕时，它便不肯把我的骨尘带到绿色草原上去……孩子，我生时爱你，死后也将爱你。我的灵魂会永远在你身边，保护你，关照你。”

老人望了望我，眼睛稍稍合上，我发现他的眼睛已经变成了两道灰色的线条。之后，就连寂静的太空也在窃听着他对我说：

“孩子，你呢，你就做赛勒玛的兄弟吧，像你父亲和我之间的关系一样。艰难时刻，你要守在她的身边，做她的终生朋友。不要让她苦恼伤心，因为痛悼死者是先辈留下的陋习。要对她说些开心的话，唱些生活的欢歌，她就会感到高兴，乐以忘忧……告诉你父亲，让他记起我。你一问他，他就会把我们青年时代展翅翱翔云端的情景告诉你……告诉你父亲，就说直到我生命的最后时刻，我还通过他的儿子表达着对他的敬慕之情……”

老人沉默片刻，而他的声音一直回荡在四壁之间。然后，他望望我，又瞧瞧赛勒玛，低声说：

“再不要医生用他的药面延长我的囚期了，因为奴役期已经结束。我的灵魂已在寻求宇宙的自由。不要让祭司站在我的床边，纵然我有过错，他的咒语也不能为我赎罪；即使我清白无辜，他的咒符也不能送我迅速进入天堂。人类的意志不能改变天意，星相家无法让星斗改道。我死之后，医生和祭司们想怎么办，就随他们的便吧！大海的波涛咆哮不止，而船依旧前进，直至航行到岸边……”

那一可怕的夜已过去一半时间，法里斯老人在黑暗中挣扎着睁开他那深陷的眼睛，那是最后一次睁眼，将目光转向伏在病榻旁的女儿。老人想说些什么，但未能说出，因为死神已吞饮了他的声音，只有几个字眼从他的唇间吐出，活像深深的喘息：

“夜……过去了……天亮了……赛勒玛……赛勒玛……”

旋即，老人低下头去，面色惨白，唇边溢出微微笑意，灵魂离开了肉体。

赛勒玛伸手去摸父亲的手，发觉那手已经冰凉。她抬起头来，朝父亲望去，发现他的面容已经罩上了死亡的面纱。此时此刻，生命在赛勒玛的体内已经凝固，眼里的泪水也已干枯。她一动未动，既没有喊叫，也没有叹息，而是像雕像似的呆滞的两眼注视着父亲那静止的遗体。随后她的肢体就像湿衣服一样松软下来，继而瘫倒，前额触及到地面。她平静地说：

“主啊，求你怜悯，让所有被折断的翅膀强健起来吧！”

＊＊＊

法里斯老人告别了人间，永恒世界拥抱了他的灵魂，大地收回了他的躯体。曼苏尔贝克占据了法里斯的钱财，而他的女儿仍然是苦难的俘虏。在赛勒玛看来，生活是恐惧在她眼前演出的可怕悲剧。

我依旧徘徊在幻梦与忧思之间。日夜轮番扰我，酷似兀鹰、秃鹫挣食猎物的肉。我多么想把自己埋在旧书堆里，以期与先人们的幻影为伴；我又多少次试图忘却自己的现状，借读经典返回古代的舞台。然而这一切毫无作用，却像用油灭火，火烧得更旺。我从先人的行列中看到的只有黑影，从各民族歌乐里听到的只有哭号。在我看来，《约伯记》(1)比大卫的乐声更美；《耶利米哀歌》(2)比所罗门的《雅歌》更动听；“巴门劫难”(3)在我心灵中引起的震撼比阿拔斯王朝(4)的辉煌事业更强烈；伊本·祖莱克的长诗比海亚姆(5)的四行诗更动人；如今，《哈姆雷特》(6)的故事，比所有作品都贴近我的心。

就这样，绝望情绪消弱了我们的视力；除了自己的可怕身影，我们什么都看不见。就这样，失望情感堵塞了我们的耳朵；除了自己那紊乱的心搏声，我们什么都听不到。

阿施塔特与耶稣之间


在贝鲁特市郊与黎巴嫩山脉接合部的果园和丘陵中间，有一座古老的小神殿，那是用矗立在橄榄树、巴旦杏树和杨柳树丛之间的一块巨大白色岩石雕凿成的。虽然这小神殿距离大车路不过半英里，但探古访幽者们当中却很少有人知道它。它和叙利亚的许多被人淡忘的重大事件一样，湮没在了被忽视的幕帘之后，似乎因为忽视遮住了考古学家们的眼睛，使它得以存在下来，进而使之成为疲惫者心灵的独处之地和寂寞恶人们的幽会场所。

走进这座奇异殿堂，便可看到东墙上有一幅刻在岩石上的腓尼基时代壁画，岁月之手抹去了它的部分线条，四季的更迭已使其色彩斑斓。画面表现的是司爱与美的女神端坐在华美宝座，周围有以各种姿势站立着的七位裸体少女，其中第一个手持火把，第二个怀抱六弦琴，第三个捧着香炉，第四个提着酒罐，第五个拿着一支玫瑰花，第六个举着桂冠，第七个拿着弓和箭。人人全神贯注地望着阿施塔特，个个面浮虔敬驯服表情。

另一面墙上，有一幅年代较新，图像亦较清晰的壁画。画面上画的是被钉在十字架上的拿撒勒人耶稣，旁边站着他那悲伤痛苦的母亲马利亚和抹大拉的马利亚(1)，还有两个痛哭流涕的妇女。

这是一幅拜占廷风格的壁画；种种证据表明，该画创作于公元五世纪或六世纪。

神殿的西墙上有两个圆形窗子，傍晚时分，夕阳从这里射入殿堂，照在两幅壁画上，仿佛画面上涂了一层金水。

神殿当中有一块方形大理石，四周有形式古朴的花纹和图案，其中有一部分已被石化了的血迹所遮盖。足以表明古人们曾在这石头上宰牲献祭，并在上面倒过作为供品的美酒、香料和油脂。

在这座小小神殿里，有的只是一片令人心慕神往的沉寂和一种神奇莫测的肃穆庄严气氛，用它那波动起伏吐露着神的秘密，无声地述说着历代变迁和百姓由一种状态转入另一状态，从信一种宗教转向信另一种宗教的历程。它能把诗人带往远离这个世界的另一个世界，说服哲学家相信人是宗教的造物，人能感受肉眼看不见的东西，能想象出感官不曾触及的领域，进而为自己的感受画出符号，用之证明自己的内心隐秘；人能通过语言、歌曲、绘画和以造型出现的雕塑，将自己生前最神圣的爱好和死后最美好的愿望和幻想形象化、具体化。

在这个不被人们注意的神殿里，我和赛勒玛每月幽会一次。我们常常久久凝视着墙上那两幅壁画，遥想在髑髅地被钉在十字架上的世代青年，想象着腓尼基男女，他们曾生活着，相恋着，借阿施塔特崇拜美，在爱与美之神的塑像前焚香，在她的祭坛上洒香水；后来，他们被大地埋没了，除了日月在永恒世界面前的名字，什么也没有留下。

如今要我用语言追述我与赛勒玛相会的那些时辰，对我来说是多么困难！那神圣的时辰充满甘甜与痛苦、快乐与忧伤、希望与失望。一切都能使人成为真正的人，而生活却是个永恒的谜。我实在难以回忆那些时刻，更无法用苍白无力的话语描绘其中的些许幻象，值得作为典范留给沉陷于爱情与忧愁的人们。

我们相会于那座古神殿，背靠墙壁坐在门口，反复回味我们的过去，探讨着我们的现在，忧虑着我们的未来。之后，我们一步一步地展示我们的心灵深处，相互诉说心中的苦闷、焦虑和遭遇的不安与忧愁。我们相互劝说对方忍耐，相互勾画希望中的欢乐蜃景和甜蜜美梦。随之，我们那恐慌的心情平静下来，泪水干了，面容也舒展开来。我们微笑着，除了爱情及其欢乐，其余一切全都忘得一干二净；除了心灵及其嗜好，其余一切均置之度外。我们相互拥抱，沉湎于迷恋与挚爱之中。之后，赛勒玛亲吻我的头发缝处，那纯情和爱情使我的内心充满光明；与此同时，我则深情地亲吻她那雪白的手指。她闭上眼睛，面颊上泛出玫瑰色的红晕，宛如黎明撒在丘岗上的第一线光芒。我们默不作声，久久地望着远方的晚霞，只见云彩被夕阳光染成了橘红色。

我们的会见不仅仅限于交流情恋和互倾苦衷，而是在不知不觉之中，无所不谈，诸如交换对这个奇妙世界的看法与想法，讨论我们读过的书，评价其优点与不足所在以及书中所涉及的虚构图景和社会法则。赛勒玛谈起妇女在人类社会中的地位，谈到先辈对妇女品德和爱好的影响，还谈到当今的婚姻关系及其中存在的病态和恶习。我记得她有一次说：“作家和诗人都试图了解妇女的真实情况，但直到现在，他们也不了解妇女心中的秘密。因为他们总是透过面纱观察她们，所以只能看到她们肉体的线条；间或他们又把妇女放在显微镜下，看到的只有她们的懦弱和驯服。”

还有一次，她指着镌刻在殿墙上的那两幅壁画，对我说：“在这块巨大岩石中心，先人刻下了两个概括妇女心愿的形象，力图表现妇女徘徊在爱与愁、同情与献身、端坐宝座的阿施塔特与站在十字架前的马利亚之间的神秘心境……男人要买荣誉、尊严和声音，而付钱的却是妇女。”

知道我们秘密幽会的只有上帝和在树林间飞来飞去的鸟儿们，赛勒玛来时，总是先乘她的马车到一个名叫“帕夏花园”的地方，下车后缓步穿过僻静的蹊径，来到小小神殿，面带安详神情，撑着伞走进殿内，便发现我已经如饥似渴地在殷切盼望之中等在了那里。

我们不怕监视者的眼睛，也没有良心受责备的感觉。因为心灵一旦被火净化，受过泪水的洗礼，就不再把人们称为过失和羞耻之类的词语放在心上，完全可以摆脱传统习惯势力给人类的心中情感规定的清规戒律的奴役，昂首站立在神的宝座之前。

人类社会降服于腐败戒律已达七十个世纪之久，仍不能理会天国里的首要永恒法则的意义。人的眼睛已经习惯于看微弱的烛光，再也不能凝视强烈的日光。心灵上的疾病和缺陷代代相传，甚至普遍流行起来，成了人必不可缺的品性，人们再也不把之当作疾病和缺陷看待，反倒将其视为上帝降给人的高贵本性；假若有谁不具有此类残疾，便被认作欠缺精神完美的残疾人。

因为赛勒玛离开她的合法丈夫的家，去与另一位男子幽会，一些人便指责她，竭力玷污她的名声。其实，这些人是柔弱的病夫，他们把健康人当成罪犯，将心灵高尚者视作叛逆者。他们简直就像在阴暗处爬行的虫子，害怕出来见光明，担心过路人把它们踩在脚下。

坐冤狱的囚徒，能够捣毁牢房的墙壁而不行动，那便是地道的懦夫。赛勒玛是个受冤枉而又不能获释的囚徒，她只是透过牢狱的铁窗眺望一下绿色原野和辽阔的天空，难道这就该受到责怨？赛勒玛走出曼苏尔贝克的家，来和我一起在神圣的阿施塔特和被钉在十字架上的耶稣之间坐一坐，仅仅如此，人们就该把她斥为叛逆女子？就让人们信口去说吧！赛勒玛已经越过淹没他们灵魂的沼泽地，到达了听不见狼嚎蛇咝的地方。让人们随意去说吧！看见过死神面孔的人，不会被盗贼的脸面吓倒；目睹过刀剑在自己头上飞舞和鲜血在脚下流淌的人，也决不在意巷子里的顽童投过来的石子。

(1) 抹大拉的马利亚是耶稣的女信徒，住在抹大拉。她曾被恶鬼所附，经耶稣拯救，从她身上赶出七个鬼来。她很崇拜耶稣，并用自己的财物支持耶稣的传道活动。但据《约翰福音》载，耶稣被钉在十字架上时，站在十字架旁边的当是耶稣的另一位女信徒马利亚，即革罗罢的妻子。





牺牲


六月末的一天，海岸边闷热得厉害，人们纷纷上山避暑。我照例向神殿走去，心中自许要见赛勒玛，手里拿着一本小小的安达鲁西亚二重韵诗集；那二重韵诗自那时直到现在，仍然使我心迷神恋。

黄昏时分，我来到神殿，坐下望着蜿蜒在柠檬树和杨柳之间的那条小路。我不时地低头看几眼诗集，间或抬起头来，对着苍穹轻声吟诵以隽永语词、和谐音律打动我心的那些二重韵诗句，同时使我追忆国王、诗人和骑士们的光辉业绩。他们告别了格拉纳达、科尔多瓦和塞维利亚(1)，把他们的希冀和志趣留在了宫殿、学院和花园里，随之他们便眼噙泪花，心怀惆怅地荫翳在了岁月的幕帘后面。

一个时辰过去，我抬眼朝小路望去，只见赛勒玛出现了，她那羸瘦的身材在彼此交织的树林间晃动，手撑着伞渐渐向我走近，仿佛她带着世界上的所有忧愁和艰难。她来到神殿门口，在我的身边坐下。我望望她那双大眼睛，发现内含种种新奇意义与秘密，足以引人警觉和注意，诱发人的探察欲望。

赛勒玛觉察到了我的心理活动，无意延长我在猜疑与忧思之间的挣扎时间，用手抚摩着我的头发，说：

“靠近我一点儿，亲爱的，靠近我一点儿，让我借你增强我的勇气。我们永久分别的时辰已经临近了。”

我放声喊道：

“这是什么意思？赛勒玛！什么力量把我们永远分开呀？”

她回答说：

“昔日把我们分开的那种盲目力量，今天将再次把我们分开。那股将人类法律作为自身解说者的无声力量，已借生活奴隶之手在你我之间筑起了一道坚固的屏障。那股创造恶魔，并让恶魔主宰人们灵魂的力量，已禁止我走出那个用白骨和骷髅建成的家宅。”

我问她：

“莫非你丈夫已经知道我们见面的事，你怕他生气并进行报复？”

她回答：

“我丈夫根本不把我放在心上，他也不晓得我如何打发日子。因为他把我丢在一边，整天与那些可怜的风尘女子混在一起，那些女子因穷困而被带入奴隶市场，只能靠浓妆艳抹，用皮肉去换取血泪和成的面做的面包。”

我说：

“那么，究竟是什么原因阻碍你到这座神殿来，面对上帝庄严和先辈的幻影坐在我的身旁呢？难道你已厌恶观察我的内心世界，你的灵魂要求告别和分离？”

她眼里噙着泪花，说：

“不是的，亲爱的。我的灵魂没有要求与你分开，因为你是它的一半；我的眼睛看你不会厌倦，因你是它的光明。但是，如若命中注定我必须戴上沉重桎梏和锁链去越过生活的重重障碍，我愿意你也遭受同样命运吗？”

我说：

“赛勒玛，你把一切情况全都告诉我吧！不要让我在这座宫里转来转去了！”

她回答说：

“我不能够把一切都说出来，因为痛苦已使我的舌头不能说话，失望已使嘴唇动弹不得。我能够说给你的，那便是我担心你落入那些人想抓我而支起的罗网中。”

我说：

“你指的是什么？赛勒玛！你担心谁会害我呢？”

她用手捂住脸，焦急地叹了口气，然后支支吾吾地说道：

“保罗·伽里卜大主教已经知道我每月都要从他为我设置的坟墓中出来一次。”

我问：

“大主教知道你在这里与我见面？”

她回答：

“假若他知道此事，你现在就看不到我坐在你身边了。不过，他总是胡乱猜疑，而且已经派出耳目监视我，指示他的仆人窥探我的行动。因此，我感到我住的房子和我走的路上，总是有人在盯着我，总是有手指指着我，有耳朵在窃听我的心灵低语。”

她低头沉思，泪流面颊，接着说：

“我并不怕大主教，因为溺水之人是不怕潮湿的。但是，我为你担心：因为你像阳光一样自由，我真怕你像我一样落入他的罗网，被他的魔爪抓住，用他的犬齿将你紧咬。我不怕灾难降临，因为所有灾难之箭都射入了我的胸膛。但我担忧的是你；因为你正值青春少年，我害怕毒蛇咬住你的双脚，使你不能登上山顶，虽然无限前程正满怀欢心地等着你。”

我对她说：

“不曾遭受白日的毒蛇和黑夜的豺狼咬过的人，总是在白日、黑夜面前逞强。不过，赛勒玛，你好好听我说，难道为了防受小人和坏蛋欺辱，眼下除了分手就没有别的路可走吗？莫非我们眼前的爱情、生活和自由之路全被堵死了吗？我们除了向死神奴隶的意愿屈服，再也没有别的办法了吗？”

她用饱含绝望和忧伤的语气说：

“眼下我们只有告别、分离了。”

听她这样一说，我的灵魂在我的肉体里造反了，我那青春的火炬烟雾四散。我攥住她的手，激昂地说：

“赛勒玛，我们长期屈从他人的意愿……自打我们初次会面到现在，我们总是被瞎子牵着走，跪倒在他们的偶像前面。自打我认识了你，我们就像两个球一样，在大主教保罗·伽里卜的手里，任凭其随意玩耍，任意丢东抛西。难道我们就这样永远任其摆弄，明明知道他心地黑暗，我们还是一味服从，直到坟墓将我们掩埋，大地将我们吞食？难道赐予我们生活的气息，为的是让我们将置于死神脚下？莫非上帝给予我们自由，为的是让我们使其变成暴虐的影子？谁用自己的手熄灭了自己的心灵之火，便背叛了点燃此火的天公。谁逆来顺受，不反抗虐待，那就是背弃真理，成了杀害无辜者的同伙。赛勒玛，我爱你，你也爱我。爱情是上帝寄存在高尚敏感心灵那里的珍宝，难道我们能把我们的珍宝抛到猪圈里，任猪用鼻子将之拱来拱去，用蹄子将其踢东踢西？我们眼前的世界是一个宽广舞台，充满着美丽神奇事物，我们为什么要在大主教及其帮凶们挖掘的狭窄地洞里苟且偷生呢？我们面前有生活，生活中有自由，自由中有欢乐和幸福，我们为什么不挣脱肩上的沉重枷锁，砸碎脚上的镣铐，奔向舒适、安静所在地呢？赛勒玛，站起来，让我们走出这座小小神殿，到上帝的巨大殿堂去，让我们离开这个国家，摆脱掉奴役和愚昧，到盗贼之手伸不到、魔鬼毒蛇够不着的遥远国度去！来吧，让我们乘夜色快速赶到海边，登上一条船，让它载着我们到海外去，在那里开始充满纯情与理解的新生活！到了那里，蛇的毒气再也喷不到我们身上，猛兽的蹄子再也踩不着我们。赛勒玛，不要犹豫彷徨，这时刻比王冠宝贵，比天使的心地高尚。赛勒玛，站起来，让我们紧跟光明之柱前进，它会把我们从干旱沙漠带往繁花似锦、芳草如茵的田园！”

赛勒玛摇摇头，双目凝视着神殿上空一种不可见的什么东西，唇上浮现出一丝凄楚的笑意，传达着她内心的磨难和痛苦。稍顷，她平静地说：

“不能啊，亲爱的，不能！苍天递到我手里的是一杯醋和苦瓜汁，我已将之喝下，杯中还剩不过几滴，我将坚持把它喝光，看看杯底究竟有什么秘密隐藏着。至于那种充满爱情、舒适和安逸的高尚的新生活，我是不配享受的，而且也无力承受它的欢乐和甜美。因为翅膀被折断的鸟儿，只能在岩石间跳来跳去，但却不能在天空翱翔、盘旋；患了眼疾的眼睛，只能看暗光里的东西，而不能直视强光。你不要对我谈论什么幸福，因为谈幸福与谈不幸一样，都会使我感到痛苦；你也不要对我描绘欢乐，因为欢乐的影子像苦难一样使我感到恐惧……不过，你要看看我，我要让你看看苍天在我的胸中灰烬之间点燃起来的圣火……你知道，我像母亲爱自己的独生子那样爱着你；正是这种爱教导我，要我保护你，保护你免受伤害，即使是因为我。正是这种用火净化过的纯真之爱，使我现在不能跟随你走天涯，使我泯灭自己的情感和爱好，以便让你自由清白地活着，永远免受人们的责骂和恶语中伤。有限的爱情要求占有被爱者，而无限的爱情只求爱的自身。青春苏醒与昏暗之间时的爱情，仅仅满足于相会、联系，通过接吻、拥抱而成长。诞生在无限怀抱和随夜晚秘密而降落的爱情，只有求得永恒和无限才能满足，只在神性面前肃然站立……昨天，当我知道大主教保罗·伽里卜想阻止我走出他侄子的家门，意欲剥夺我结婚之后的唯一乐趣时，我站立在我的房间窗前，眺望大海，心中思想着海外的宽广国家、精神自由和个人独立，想象着自己生活在你的身边，被你的精神幻影包围，深深沉浸在你的柔情之中。然而，这些照亮被压迫妇女胸怀、使她们反抗陋习，以求生活在真理与自由氛围中的美梦，刚刚从我脑海里闪过，我便感到自惭形秽了。我认为我们之间的爱情脆弱得很，简直无力站在太阳面前。想到这里，我哭了起来，就像一位失去王位的君王和一个失去财宝的富翁。但是，不久我便透过泪滴看到了你的面容，看到了你的眼睛在凝视着我，想起了一次你对我说的话：‘来吧，赛勒玛，让我们在敌人的面前像勇士一样挺立，用我们的胸膛而不是用脊背迎着敌人的刀锋剑刃吧！我们倒下去，要像烈士那样壮烈；我们得胜时，要像英雄那样活着……在艰难困苦面前，坚定地忍受心灵上的折磨，总比退缩到安全、舒适的地方要高尚。’亲爱的，当死神的翅膀在我父亲的病榻周围拍击时，你对我说了这几句话。昨天，当绝望的翅膀在我的头上扇动时，我想起这几句话，受到了鼓舞，增添了勇气，感到自己在黑暗之中获得了心灵上的自由，使我蔑视灾难和痛苦。在我看来，我们的爱情深似大海，高若星辰，宽如浩宇。我今天来见你，在我疲惫、愁苦的心灵中有一股新的力量，那就是为得到更伟大的收获，必须牺牲伟大收获的决心。我决计牺牲在你身边的幸福，以便让你在人们面前体面地生活，远避他人的背弃和压迫……我昨天来这里时，软弱的双脚上拖着沉重的铁镣；而今天，我却带着无视铁镣沉重、不顾路途漫长的决心来到了这个地方。过去，我来这里，好像一个夜行的幻影，心惊胆战；如今，我像一个充满生气的女性，深深感到应该牺牲，晓知痛的价值，一心想保护自己所爱的人，使之免遭愚昧无知之辈欺辱，同时也使之免受她那饥渴心灵的牵累。过去，我坐在你的面前，活像一个颤抖的影子；今天，我来到这里，要在神圣的阿施塔特女神和被钉在十字架上的耶稣面前，让你一睹我的真实面目。我是生长在阴影下的一棵树，如今已伸出枝条，以便在日光下摇曳一个时辰……亲爱的，我是来同你告别的；就让我们的告别像我们的爱情一样伟大、庄重，像熔金的烈火一样，使金光更加灿烂。”

赛勒玛没有给我留下说话和争辩的余地，而是望着我，双目闪着光芒，那光芒将我的身心紧紧拥抱。这时，她的脸上罩起庄严的面纱，俨然像一位令人严肃起敬的女王。随后，她带着我从未见过的柔情扑到我的怀里，用她那光滑的手臂搂住我的脖子，久久地热吻我的双唇，唤醒了我体内的活力，激发了我心灵中的隐秘，使被我称作“我”的实体自我背叛整个世界，无声地屈从于神灵天规；把赛勒玛的胸膛作为神殿，将她的心灵当作圣殿，顶礼膜拜，毕恭毕敬。

＊＊＊

夕阳落山，最后的余晖从花园、园林中消隐了。赛勒玛抖了抖身子，站在神殿中央，久久望着殿的墙壁和角落，仿佛想把她的双目之光全部倾在那些壁画和雕饰上。之后，她向前移动稍许，虔诚地跪在十字架上的耶稣像前一次又一次地亲吻着耶稣那受伤的双脚，低声细语地说：

“耶稣啊，我选定了你的十字架，抛弃了阿施塔特女神的欢乐。我要用芒刺代替桂花枝，编成花环，戴在自己的头上；我要用我的血和泪替代香水浴身；我要用盛美酒和多福河水的杯子饮下酸酒和苦西瓜汁。请你让我加入你那以弱为强的信徒行列，让我和那些由你选定的、将心上的忧愁当作欢乐的人们一起走向髑髅地吧！”

随后，她站起来，回头望着我说：

“现在，我将高高兴兴地回到群魔乱舞的黑暗的洞穴中去，亲爱的，你不要怜悯我，莫为我而感到难过！因为看见过上帝影子的心灵，是不会惧怕魔影的；一睹天堂盛果的眼睛，人间的痛苦无法再使之合上。”

赛勒玛身裹绸衣，走出了那座神殿，只留下我独自迷惘、彷徨、沉思，终于被带入了梦中幻景：神端坐宝座，天使记录着人的功过，精灵高声诵读生活悲剧，仙女吟唱爱情、悲伤和永恒之歌。

当我从这沉醉里苏醒过来时，夜色已用它那漆黑的幕幔笼罩了万物。我发现自己正在那些园林中踱步，耳朵仍在响着赛勒玛说过的那些话的回音，她的一动一静、面部表情和手势姿态一次又一次浮现在我的心灵中。当告别及其后的孤寂、思念的痛苦现实展现在我面前时，我的思想凝固了，我的心弦松弛了，第一次晓得人即使生下来时是自由的，却始终是先辈们制定的残酷清规戒律的奴隶；那被我们想象为天定秘密的命运，即是今天屈服于昨天，明天必向今日倾向让步。从那天夜里直到现在，我曾多少次思考使赛勒玛宁死勿生的心理规律；我又多少次将牺牲的崇高与叛逆者幸福进行比较，以便察看哪个更伟大、更壮美。但是，直至现在，我只明白了一条真理，那便是：真诚使一切行为变得美好、高尚；赛勒玛正是真诚的标志，虔诚的化身。

救星


赛勒玛结婚五年，未曾生一男半女。一个孩子，可使夫妻间建立起精神联系；孩子的微笑，能拉近相互厌恶的两颗心灵，如同黎明将黑夜的末尾与白日的开端连接在一起。

不育女子，在任何地方都会遭冷眼。因为自私心理向多数男人这样描述前景：生命的继续在于子嗣体躯。因此，他们要求生儿育女，以便他们永生在大地上。

实利主义男子看待不育妻子，如同看慢性自杀。因此，他厌恶她，遗弃她，希望她死，仿佛她是一个想置他于死地的背信弃义的仇敌。曼苏尔贝克就是一个实利主义者，像黄土一样平庸、钢铁一样冷酷、墓地一样贪婪。他渴望有个儿子，继承他的姓名和性格；正是这种渴望使他讨厌可怜的赛勒玛；在他的的眼里，赛勒玛的美德，变成了不可宽恕的罪恶。

生长在山洞里的树不会结果，屈居生活阴影下的赛勒玛不可能生育。夜莺不会在笼子里筑巢，已防将奴隶身份传给雏鸟。赛勒玛是个不幸囚徒，苍天没有把她的生命分成两个俘虏。山谷里的鲜花，本是太阳的温情与大自然的恋意相结合生下的孩子；人类的孩子，则是爱情与怜悯孕出来的鲜花。赛勒玛在那座建在贝鲁特角海边的豪宅里，从来没有感受到怜悯的气息和温情的触摸。但是，她常在夜深人静之时向苍天祈祷，求主赐予她一个孩子，期望孩子用他那玫瑰色的手指揩干她的眼泪，用他的目光驱散她心中的死神幻影。

赛勒玛苦心祈祷，致使天空中响彻祷告声和恳求声。她虔诚求救，呼唤声驱散了乌云。苍天听到了她的呼声，把一支充满甜蜜情感的欢歌播入了她的腹中，终于让她在结婚五个年头之后，准备做母亲，一扫她的屈辱了。

生长在山洞里的树要开花结果了。

被关在笼中的夜莺要用自己翅膀上的翎羽筑巢了。

被丢在脚下的六弦琴，已被放在东方吹来的微风口上，等待风波吹动它剩余的琴弦了。

可怜的赛勒玛伸出她那戴着锁链的双臂，就要接受苍天的赐赠了。

一个不育的女人，一旦永恒规律让她准备做母亲，她的欢快心情是生活中的其他欢乐所不能与之相比的。春天苏醒时的壮美与黎明带来的所有欢乐，全都聚集在权利曾被上帝剥夺、随后又蒙赐予的女人的胸间。

世间没有比腹中胎儿里放出来的光芒更灿烂夺目的了。

当四月漫步在丘山和坡地时，赛勒玛十月怀胎，就要产下第一个胎儿了。仿佛大自然已与她约定好，开始生出百花，并用温暖襁褓包裹青草婴儿。

等待的数月过去了，赛勒玛盼着解脱之日，就像出门人盼着启明星升起。她透过泪帘看未来，看到未来闪着光；透过眼泪看黑暗的东西常常闪烁光芒。

一天夜里，黑暗阴影在贝鲁特角的住宅区里游荡。赛勒玛躺在床上，阵痛已经开始。生与死在她的床边激烈地搏斗着。医生和接生婆站在那里，准备为这个世界送来一位新客。路上已静下来，不见行人来往，海浪的歌声也已低沉下来，只听到曼苏尔贝克·伽里卜的家宅窗里传出高声喊叫……那是生命与生命分离的喊声……那是虚无太空中求生欲望的呼声……那是人的有限力量在无限力量静默面前发出的呐喊……那是躺在生与死两位巨神脚下的柔弱的赛勒玛的喊声。

东方透出黎明曙光之时，赛勒玛生下一个男婴。当她听到婴儿初啼声时，她睁开由于疼痛而合上的双眼，向四周张望，看到房间里满是笑脸……当她再次定睛凝视时，发现生与死仍在她的床边搏斗，于是她又合上了眼，第一次喊道：

“我的孩子啊！”

接生婆用丝绸襁褓把婴儿裹好，放在母亲对面，而医生却用忧愁的目光望着赛勒玛，不时默默摇头。

欢乐声惊醒了部分邻居，他们纷纷穿着睡衣去向孩子的父亲道贺，而医生却用慈悲的目光望着母子。

仆人们急忙去向曼苏尔贝克报告后继有人的喜讯，盼望得到赏钱，而医生一直站在那里，用绝望的目光凝视着赛勒玛和她的婴儿。

太阳出来了。赛勒玛将孩子抱近乳房，孩子第一次睁开眼睛，望着她的眼睛，随之一阵抽搐，便最后一次闭上了眼睛。医生走过去，将孩子从她的双臂间抱走，但见两颗硕大泪珠夺眶滚落在他的面颊上，随后低声细语道：

“这是位匆匆来去的过客啊！”

孩子死了，而本区的居民们还在大厅里与孩子的父亲一道欢庆，祝曼苏尔贝克先生长寿呢！可怜的赛勒玛凝视着医生，高声喊道：

“把孩子给我，让我抱抱！”

当她再度凝神注目时，发现死与生依然在她的床边搏斗着。

孩子死了，而庆贺孩子降生的人们依旧把盏碰杯，欢声一浪高过一浪。

孩子与黎明一起出生，在日出时分死去，哪个人能将时间丈量一下，并且告诉我们：从黎明到日出这段时间，是不是比一些民族从崛起到衰亡的岁月更暂短呢？

孩子像念头一样产生，似叹气一样死去，若阴影一样消隐，他使赛勒玛尝到了母性的滋味，但他既没有让她幸福，也没有来得及把死神的手从她的心头移开。

那是一个短暂的生命，自夜末开始，随着白日到来结束，正如一滴朝露，从黑夜眼中淌出，随即被晨光手指揩干。

那是永恒法则刚刚吐出一个字眼，旋即后悔，随之将它送回永久沉寂中去……

那是一颗珍珠，涨潮将之刚刚抛到岸边，退潮又把它卷入大海深处……

那是一朵百合花，刚从生命的花芯中绽放出来，便在死神脚下被踩得粉碎……

那是一位贵客，赛勒玛急切地盼他到来，但他却刚来就走了；两扇门刚刚开启，他已影踪全无……

那是一个胎儿，刚刚长成孩子，便已化成了泥土。这就是人的一生，而且是民族的一生，也是太阳、月亮、星辰的一生。赛勒玛把目光转向医生，无限思念地叹了口气，高声喊道：

“把我的儿子给我，让我抱抱他……把我的孩子给我，让我给他喂奶……”

医生低下头，哽咽得几乎说不出话来：

“太太，孩子……他……死啦……你要坚强些，要忍耐，好好活下去。”

赛勒玛一声大喊，随之沉默片刻。接着，她高兴地微微一笑，容光焕发，仿佛知道了一件不曾知晓的什么事，平静地说：

“把我孩子的尸体给我，让他死了也要靠近我的身旁。”

医生把死婴抱起来，放在她的怀里。赛勒玛把死婴紧紧抱在胸前，将脸转向墙壁，对死婴说：

“孩子，你是来带我走的。你是给我指引一条通向彼岸的道路的。孩子，我就在这儿，你在前面领路，让我们一起走出这黑暗洞穴吧！”

片刻之后，阳光透过窗帘射进房间，洒落在躺在床上的两具尸体上；那床由母性的庄严守护，被死神的翅膀遮盖着。

医生哭着走出房间。当他来到大厅里，道喜者们的欢呼立即被号哭声所替代。曼苏尔贝克没有大声喊叫，没有叹气，既没有淌一滴眼泪，也没有说一句话，一直呆站在那里，如同一尊塑像，右手还握着酒杯。

＊＊＊

第二天，赛勒玛身穿白色婚纱，被放入雪白天鹅绒衬里的棺材里。她的孩子则裹着襁褓，母亲那寂静的怀抱则做了他的棺木和坟墓。

人们抬着一口棺材中的两具尸体，缓步走去；那缓慢脚步酷似临终者的心脏搏动。送葬的人们朝前走去，我夹在他们中间，谁也不认识我，无从知道我的心情。

人们到达墓地，大主教保罗·伽里卜挺直站着，开始吟诵赞美诗，念咒语。祭司们站在大主教周围，唱圣歌、做祈祷，他们那阴暗的脸上毫无表情，蒙着一层心不在焉的面纱。

当人们把棺材放入墓坑时，一个站着的人低声说：

“这是我第一次看见两具尸体合用一口棺材……”

另一个人说：

“仿佛孩子是带母亲走的。目的在于把母亲从其丈夫的暴虐和冷酷中拯救出来。”

又有一个人说：

“你们仔细瞧瞧曼苏尔贝克那张脸，他正瞪着两只玻璃眼望天，仿佛他没有在一天之中丧妻又失子。”

还有一个人说：

“明天，他的大主教叔叔会给他娶一个更有钱、更健壮的婆娘。”

祭司们不住诵经、祈祷，直到掘墓工将坟土堆好。接着，送殡的人们一个一个地走近大主教和她的侄子，用种种善言劝二人忍耐节哀和安慰叔侄俩。我则孤零零地站在那里，没有人对我的灾难表示慰问，好像赛勒玛母子不是我最亲近的人。

送殡的人们回去了，只剩下一个掘墓工站在那座新坟墓旁，手里握着锹和铲。我走近他，问道：

“你还记得法里斯·凯拉麦的坟墓在什么地方吗？”

他久久望着我，然后指着赛勒玛的坟，说：

“就在这个坟坑里。他的女儿躺在他的怀里，而女儿的怀里还抱着自己的小儿子。我用这把锹，把他们全埋在土里了。”

我对他说：

“师傅，你把我的心也埋在了这个坑里。你的双臂真有力气！”

掘墓工的身影消失在松林后，我再也忍耐不住，扑在赛勒玛的坟上，痛悼失声，泪淌不止。





A Tear and a Smile





The Life of Love


Spring


Come, my beloved; let us walk amidst the knolls,

For the snow is water, and Life is alive from its

Slumber and is roaming the hills and valleys.

Let us follow the footprints of Spring into the

Distant fields, and mount the hilltops to draw

Inspiration high above the cool green plains.




Dawn of Spring has unfolded her winter-kept garment

And placed it on the peach and citrus trees; and

They appear as brides in the ceremonial custom of

the Night of Kedre.




The sprigs of grapevine embrace each other like

Sweethearts, and the brooks burst out in dance

Between the rocks, repeating the song of joy;

And the flowers bud suddenly from the heart of

Nature, like foam from the rich heart of the sea.




Come, my beloved; let us drink the last of Winter's

Tears from the cupped lilies, and soothe our spirits

With the shower of notes from the birds, and wander

In exhilaration through the intoxicating breeze.

Let us sit by that rock, where violets hide; let us

Pursue their exchange of the sweetness of kisses.





Summer


Let us go into the fields, my beloved, for the

Time of harvest approaches, and the sun's eyes

Are ripening the grain.

Let us tend the fruit of the earth, as the

Spirit nourishes the grains of Joy from the

Seeds of Love, sowed deep in our hearts.

Let us fill our bins with the products of

Nature, as life fills so abundantly the

Domain of our hearts with her endless bounty.

Let us make the flowers our bed, and the

Sky our blanket, and rest our heads together

Upon pillows of soft hay.

Let us relax after the day's toil, and listen

To the provoking murmur of the brook.





Autumn


Let us go and gather grapes in the vineyard

For the winepress, and keep the wine in old

Vases, as the spirit keeps Knowledge of the

Ages in eternal vessels.




Let us return to our dwelling, for the wind has

Caused the yellow leaves to fall and shroud the

Withering flowers that whisper elegy to Summer.

Come home, my eternal sweetheart, for the birds

Have made pilgrimage to warmth and lest the chilled

Prairies suffering pangs of solitude. The jasmine

And myrtle have no more tears.




Let us retreat, for the tired brook has

Ceased its song; and the bubblesome springs

Are drained of their copious weeping; and

Their cautious old hills have stored away

Their colourful garments.




Come, my beloved; Nature is justly weary

And is bidding her enthusiasm farewell

With quiet and contented melody.





Winter


Come close to me, oh companion of my full life;

Come close to me and let not Winter's touch

Enter between us. Sit by me before the hearth,

For fire is the only fruit of Winter.




Speak to me of the glory of your heart, for

That is greater than the shrieking elements

Beyond our door

Bind the door and seal the transoms, for the

Angry countenance of the heaven depresses my

Spirit, and the face of our snow-laden fields

Makes my soul cry.




Feed the lamp with oil and let it not dim, and

Place it by you, So I can read with tears what

Your life with me has written upon your face.




Bring Autumn's wine. Let us drink and sing the

Song of remembrance to Spring's carefree sowing,

And Summer's watchful tending, and Autumn's

Reward in harvest.




Come close to me, oh beloved of my soul; the

Fire is cooling and fleeing under the ashes.

Embrace me, for I fear loneliness; the lamp is

Dim, and the wine which we pressed is closing

Our eyes. Let us look upon each other before

They are shut.

Find me with your arms and embrace me; let

Slumber then embrace our souls as one

Kiss me, my beloved, for Winter has stolen

All but our moving lips.




You are close by me, My Forever.

How deep and wide will be the ocean of Slumber,

And how recent was the dawn！





The City of the Dead


Yesterday I drew myself from the noisome throngs and proceeded into the field until I reached a knoll upon which Nature had spread her comely garments. Now I could breathe.

I looked back, and the city appeared with its magnificent mosques and stately residences veiled by the smoke of the shops.

I commenced analyzing man's mission, but could conclude only that most of his life was identified with struggle and hardship. Then I tried not to ponder over what the sons of Adam had done, and centred my eyes on the field which is the throne of God's glory. In one secluded corner of the field I observed a burying ground surrounded by poplar trees.

There, between the city of the dead and the city of the living, I meditated. I thought of the eternal silence in the first and the endless sorrow in the second.

In the city of the living I found hope and despair, love and hatred, joy and sorrow, wealth and poverty, faith and infidelity.

In the city of the dead there is buried earth in earth that Nature converts, in the night's silence, into vegetation, and then into animal, and then into man. As my mind wandered in this fashion, I saw a procession moving slowly and reverently, accompanied by pieces of music that filled the sky with sad melody. It was an elaborate funeral. The dead was followed by the living who wept and lamented his going. As the cortege reached the place of interment the priests commenced praying and burning incense, and musicians blowing and plucking their instruments, mourning the departed. Then the leaders came forward one after the other and recited their eulogies with fine choice of words.

At last the multitude departed, leaving the dead resting in a most spacious and beautiful vault, expertly designed in stone and iron, and surrounded by the most expensively-entwined wreaths of flowers.

The farewell-bidders returned to the city and I remained, watching them from a distance and speaking softly to myself while the sun was descending to the horizon and Nature was making her many preparations for slumber.

Then I saw two men labouring under the weight of a wooden casket, and behind them a shabby-appearing woman carrying an infant on her arms. Following last was a dog who, with heartbreaking eyes, stared first at the woman and then at the casket.

It was a poor funeral. This guest of Death left to cold society a miserable wife and an infant to share her sorrows and a faithful dog whose heart knew of his companion's departure.

As they reached the burial place they deposited the casket into a ditch away from the tended shrubs and marble stones, and retreated after a few simple words to God. The dog made one last turn to look at his friend's grave as the small group disappeared behind the trees.

I looked at the city of the living and said to myself, “That place belongs to the few.” Then I looked upon the trim city of the dead and said, “That place, too, belongs to the few. Oh Lord, where is the haven of all the people?”

As I said this, I looked toward the clouds, mingled with the sun's longest and most beautiful golden rays. And I heard a voice within me saying, “Over there！”





A Poet's Death is His Life


The dark wings of night enfolded the city upon which Nature had spread a pure white garment of snow; and men deserted the streets for their houses in search of warmth, while the north wind probed in contemplation of laying waste the gardens. There in the suburb stood an old hut heavily laden with snow and on the verge of falling. In a dark recess of that hovel was a poor bed in which a dying youth was lying, staring at the dim light of his oil lamp, made to flicker by the entering winds. He a man in the spring of life who foresaw fully that the peaceful hour of freeing himself from the clutches of life was fast nearing. He was awaiting Death's visit gratefully, and upon his pale face appeared the dawn of hope; and on his lops a sorrowful smile; and in his eyes forgiveness.

He was poet perishing from hunger in the city of living rich. He was placed in the earthly world to enliven the heart of man with his beautiful and profound sayings. He as noble soul, sent by the Goddess of Understanding to soothe and make gentle the human spirit. But alas！He gladly bade the cold earth farewell without receiving a smile from its strange occupants.

He was breathing his last and had no one at his bedside save the oil lamp, his only companion, and some parchments upon which he had inscribed his heart's feeling. As he salvaged the remnants of his withering strength he lifted his hands heavenward; he moved his eyes hopelessly, as if wanting to penetrate the ceiling in order to see the stars from behind the veil clouds.

And he said, “Come, oh beautiful Death; my soul is longing for you. Come close to me and unfasten the irons life, for I am weary of dragging them. Come, oh sweet Death, and deliver me from my neighbours who looked upon me as a stranger because I interpret to them the language of the angels. Hurry, oh peaceful Death, and carry me from these multitudes who left me in the dark corner of oblivion because I do not bleed the weak as they do. Come, oh gentle Death, and enfold me under your white wings, for my fellowmen are not in want of me. Embrace me, oh Death, full of love and mercy; let your lips touch my lips which never tasted a mother's kiss, not touched a sister's cheeks, not caresses a sweetheart's fingertips. Come and take me, by beloved Death.”

Then, at the bedside of the dying poet appeared an angel who possessed a supernatural and divine beauty, holding in her hand a wreath of lilies. She embraced him and closed his eyes so he could see no more, except with the eye of his spirit. She impressed a deep and long and gently withdrawn kiss that left and eternal smile of fulfilment upon his lips. Then the hovel became empty and nothing was lest save parchments and papers which the poet had strewn with bitter futility.

Hundreds of years later, when the people of the city arose from the diseases slumber of ignorance and saw the dawn of knowledge, they erected a monument in the most beautiful garden of the city and celebrated a feast every year in honour of that poet, whose writings had freed them. Oh, how cruel is man's ignorance！





The Creation


The God separated a spirit from Himself and fashioned it into Beauty. He showered upon her all the blessings of gracefulness and kindness. He gave her the cup of happiness and said, “Drink not from this cup unless you forget the past and the future, for happiness is naught but the moment.” And He also gave her a cup of sorrow and said, “Drink from this cup and you will understand the meaning of the fleeting instants of the joy of life, for sorrow ever abounds.”

And the God bestowed upon her a love that would desert he forever upon her first sigh of earthly satisfaction, and a sweetness that would vanish with her first awareness of flattery.

And He gave her wisdom from heaven to lead to the all-righteous path, and placed in the depth of her heart and eye that sees the unseen, and created in he an affection and goodness toward all things. He dressed her with raiment of hopes spun by the angels of heaven from the sinews of the rainbow. And He cloaked her in the shadow of confusion, which is the dawn of life and light.

Then the God took consuming fire from the furnace of anger, and searing wind from the desert of ignorance, and sharp-cutting sands from the shore of selfishness, and coarse earth from under the feet of ages, and combined them all and fashioned Man. He gave to Man a blind power that rages and drives him into a madness which extinguishes only before gratification of desire, and placed life in him which is the spectre of death.

And the god laughed and cried. He felt an overwhelming love and pity for Man, and sheltered him beneath His guidance.





Laughter and Tears


As the Sun withdrew his rays from the garden, and the moon threw cushioned beams upon the flowers, I sat under the trees pondering upon the phenomena of the atmosphere, looking through the branches at the strewn stars which glittered like chips of silver upon a blue carpet; and I could hear from a distance the agitated murmur of the rivulet singing its way briskly into the valley.

When the birds took shelter among the boughs, and the flowers folded their petals, and tremendous silence descended, I heard a rustle of feet though the grass. I took heed and saw a young couple approaching my arbour. The say under a tree where I could see them without being seen.

After he looked about in every direction, I heard the young man saying, “Sit by me, my beloved, and listen to my heart; smile, for your happiness is a symbol of our future; be merry, for the sparkling days rejoice with us.

“My soul is warning me of the doubt in your heart, for doubt in love is a sin.

“Soon you will be the owner of this vast land, lighted by this beautiful moon; soon you will be the mistress of my palace, and all the servants and maids will obey your commands.

“Smile, my beloved, like the gold smiles from my father's coffers.

“My heart refuses to deny you its secret. Twelve months of comfort and travel await us; for a year we will spend my father's gold at the blue lakes of Switzerland, and viewing the edifices of Italy and Egypt, and resting under the Holy Cedars of Lebanon; you will meet the princesses who will envy you for your jewels and clothes.

“All these things I will do for you; will you be satisfied?”

In a little while I saw them walking and stepping on flowers as the rich step upon the hearts of the poor. As they disappeared from my sight, I commenced to make comparison between love and money, and to analyze their position in the heart.

Money！The source of insincere love; the spring of false light and fortune; the well of poisoned water; the desperation of old age！

I was still wandering in the vast desert of contemplation when a forlorn and spectre-like couple passed by me and sat on the grass; a young man and a young woman who had left their farming shacks in the nearby fields for this cool and solitary place.

After a few moments of complete silence, I heard the following words uttered with sighs from weather-bitten lips, “Shed not tears, my beloved; love that opens our eyes and enslaves our hearts can give us the blessing of patience. Be consoled in our delay, for we have taken an oath and entered Love's shrine; for our love will ever grow in adversity; for it is in Love's name that we are suffering the obstacles of poverty and the sharpness of misery and the emptiness of separation. I shall attack these hardships until I triumph and place in your hands a strength that will help over all things to complete the journey of life.

“Love—which is God—will consider our sighs and tears as incense burned at His altar and He will reward us with fortitude. Good-bye, my beloved; I must leave before the heartening moon vanishes.”

A pure voice, combined of the consuming flame of love, and the hopeless bitterness of longing and the resolved sweetness of patience, said, “Good-bye, my beloved.”

They separated, and the elegy to their union was smothered by the wails of my crying heart.

I looked upon slumbering Nature, and with deep reflection discovered the reality of a vast and infinite thing—something no power could demand, influence acquire, nor riches purchase. Nor could it be effaced by the tears of time or deadened by sorrow; a thing which cannot be discovered by the blue lakes of Switzerland or the beautiful edifices of Italy.

It is something that gathers strength with patience, grows despite obstacles, warms in winter, flourishes in spring, casts a breeze in summer, and bears fruit in autumn—I found Love.





Vision


There in the middle of the field, by the side of a crystalline stream, I saw a bird-cage whose rods and hinges were fashioned by an expert's hands. In one corner lay a dead bird, and in another were two basins—one empty of water and the other of seeds. I stood there reverently, as if the lifeless bird and the murmur of the water were worthy of deep silence and respect—something worth of examination and meditation by the heard and conscience.

As I engrossed myself in view and thought, I found that the poor creature had died of thirst beside a stream of water, and of hunger in the midst of a rich field, cradle of life; like a rich man locked inside his iron safe, perishing from hunger amid heaps of gold.

Before my eyes I saw the cage turned suddenly into a human skeleton, and the dead bird into a man's heart which was bleeding from a deep wound that looked like the lips of a sorrowing woman. A voice came from that wound saying, “I am the human heart, prisoner of substance and victim of earthly laws.

“In God's field of Beauty, at the edge of the stream of life, I was imprisoned in the cage of laws made by man.

“In the centre of beautiful Creation I died neglected because I was kept from enjoying the freedom of God's bounty.

“Everything of beauty that awakens my love and desire is a disgrace, according to man's conceptions; everything of goodness that I crave is but naught, according to his judgment.

“I am the lost human heart, imprisoned in the foul dungeon of man's dictates, tied with chains of earthly authority, dead and forgotten by laughing humanity whose tongue is tied and whose eyes are empty of visible tears.”

All these words I heard, and I saw them emerging with a stream of ever thinning blood from that wounded heart.

More was said, but my misted eyes and crying should prevented further sight or hearing.





Yesterday and Today


The gold-hoarder walked in his palace park and with him walked his troubles. And over his head hovered worries as a vulture hovers over a carcass, until he reached a beautiful lake surrounded by magnificent marble statuary.

He sat there pondering the water which poured from the mouths of the statues like thoughts flowing freely from a lover's imagination, and contemplating heavily his palace which stood upon a knoll like a birthmark upon the cheek of a maiden. His fancy revealed to him the pages of his life's drama which he read with falling tears that veiled his eyes and prevented him from viewing man's feeble additions to Nature.

He looked back with piercing regret to the images of his early life, woven into pattern by the gods, until he could no longer control his anguish. He said aloud, “Yesterday I was grazing my sheep in the green valley, enjoying my existence, sounding my flute, and holding my head high. Today I am a prisoner of greed. Gold leads into gold, then into restlessness and finally into crushing misery.

“Yesterday I was like a singing bird, soaring freely here and there in the fields. Today I am a slave to fickle wealth, society's rules, and city's customs, and purchased friends, pleasing the people by conforming to the strange and narrow laws of man. I was born to be free and enjoy the bounty of life, but I find myself like a beast of burden so heavily laden with gold that his back is breaking.

“Where are the spacious plains, the singing brooks, the pure breeze, the closeness of Nature? Where is my deity? I have lost all！Naught remains save loneliness that saddens me, gold that ridicules me, slaves who curse to my back, and a palace that I have erected as a tomb for my happiness, and in whose greatness I have lost my heart.

“Yesterday I roamed the prairies and the hills together with the Bedouin's daughter; Virtue was our companion, Love our delight, and the moon our guardian. Today I am among women with shallow beauty who sell themselves for gold and diamonds.

“Yesterday I was carefree, sharing with the shepherds all the joy of life; eating, playing, working, singing, and dancing together to the music of the heart's truth. Today I find myself among the people like a frightened lamb among the wolves. As I walk in the roads, they gaze at me with hateful eyes and point at me with scorn and jealousy, and as I steal through the park I see frowning faces all about me.

“Yesterday I was rich in happiness and today I am poor in gold.

“Yesterday I was a happy shepherd looking upon his head as a merciful king looks with pleasure upon his contented subjects. Today I am a slave standing before my wealth, my wealth which robbed me of the beauty of life I once knew.

“Forgive me, my Judge！I did not know that riches would put my life in fragments and lead me into the dungeons of harshness and stupidity. What I thought was glory is naught but an eternal inferno.”

He gathered himself wearily and walked slowly toward the palace, sighing and repeating, “Is this what people call wealth? Is this the god I am serving and worshipping? Is this what I seek of the earth? Why can I not trade it for one particle of contentment? Who would sell me one beautiful thought for a ton of gold? Who would give me one moment of love for a handful of gems? Who would grant me an eye that can see others' hearts, and take all my coffers in barter?”

As he reached the palace gates he turned and looked toward the city as Jeremiah gazed toward Jerusalem. He raised his arms in woeful lament and shouted, “Oh people of the noisome city, who are living in darkness, hastening toward misery, preaching falsehood, and speaking with stupidity……until when shall you remain ignorant? Unit when shall you abide in the filth of life and continue to desert its gardens? Why wear you tattered robes of narrowness while the silk raiment of Nature's beauty is fashioned for you? The lamp of wisdom is dimming; it is time to furnish it with oil. The house of true fortune is being destroyed; it is time to rebuild it and guard it. The thieves of ignorance have stolen the treasure of your peace; it is time to retake it！”

At that moment a poor man stood before him and stretched forth his hand for alms. As he looked at the beggar, his lips parted, his eyes brightened with a softness, and his face radiated kindness. It was as if the yesterday he had lamented by the lake had come to greet him. He embraced the pauper with affection and filled his hands with gold, and with a voice sincere with the sweetness of love he said, “Come back tomorrow and bring with you your fellow sufferers. All your possessions will be restored.”

He entered his palace saying, “Everything in life is good; even gold, for it teaches a lesson. Money is like a stringed instrument; he who does not know how to use it properly will hear only discordant music. Money is like love; it kills slowly and painfully the one who withholds it, and it enlivens the other who turns it upon his fellow man.”





The Widow and Her Son


Night fell over North Lebanon and snow was covering the villages surrounded by the Kadeesha Valley, giving the fields and prairies the appearance of a great sheet of parchment upon which the furious Nature was recording her many deeds. Men came home from the streets while silence engulfed the night.

In a lone house near those villages lived a woman who sat by her fireside spinning wool, and at her side was her only child, staring now at the fire and then at his mother.

A terrible roar of thunder shook the house and the little boy shook with fright. He threw his arms about his mother, seeking protection from Nature in her affection. She took him to her bosom and kissed him; then she say him on her lap and said, “Do not fear, my son, for Nature is but comparing her great power to man's weakness. There is a Supreme Being beyond the falling snow and the heavy clouds and the blowing wind, and He knows the needs of the earth, for He made it; and He looks upon the weak with merciful eyes.

“Be brave, my boy. Nature smiles in Spring and laughs in Summer and yawns in Autumn, but now she is weeping; and with her tears she waters life, hidden under the earth.

“Sleep, my dear child; your father is viewing us from Eternity. The snow and thunder bring us closer to him at this time.

“Sleep, my beloved, for this white blanket which makes us cold, keeps the seeds warm, and these war—like things will produce beautiful flowers when Nisan comes.

“Thus, my child, man cannot reap love until after sad and revealing separation, and bitter patience, and desperate hardship. Sleep, my little boy; sweet dreams will find your soul who is unafraid of the terrible darkness of night and the biting frost.”

The little boy looked upon his mother with sleep-laden eyes and said, “Mother, my eyes are heavy, but I cannot go to bed without saying my prayer.”

The woman looked at his angelic face, her vision blurred by misted eyes, and said, “Repeat with me, my boy—‘God, have mercy on the poor and protect them from the winter; warm their thin-clad bodies with Thy merciful hands; look upon the orphans who are sleeping in wretched houses, suffering from hunger and cold. Hear, oh Lord, the call of widows who are helpless and shivering with fear for their young. Open, oh Lord, the hearts of all humans, that they may see the misery of the weak. Have mercy upon the sufferers who knock on doors, and lead the wayfarers into warm places. Watch, oh Lord, over the little birds and protect the trees and fields from the anger of the storm; for Thou art merciful and full of love.’”

As Slumber captured the boy's spirit, his mother placed him in the bed and kissed his eyes with quivering lips. Then she went back and sat by the hearth, spinning the wool to make him raiment.





Before the Throne of Beauty


One heavy day I ran away from the grim face of society and the dizzying clamour of the city and directed my weary step to the spacious alley. I pursued the beckoning course of the rivulet and the musical sounds of the birds until I reached a lonely spot where the flowing branches of the trees prevented the sun from the touching the earth.

I stood there, and it was entertaining to my soul—my thirsty soul who had seen naught but the mirage of life instead of its sweetness.

I was engrossed deeply in thought and my spirits were sailing the firmament when a hour, wearing a sprig of grapevine that covered part of her naked body, and a wreath of poppies about her golden hair, suddenly appeared to me. As she realized my astonishment, she greeted me saying, “Fear me not; I am the Nymph of the Jungle.”

“How can beauty like yours be committed to live in this place? Please tell me who your are, and whence you come?” I asked. She sat gracefully on the green grass and responded, “I am the symbol of nature！I am the ever virgin your forefathers worshipped, and to my honour they erected shrines and temples at Baalbek and Jbeil.” And I dared say, “But those temples and shrines were laid waste and the bones of my adoring ancestors became a part of the earth; nothing was left to commemorate their goddess save a pitiful few and the forgotten pages in the book of history.”

She replied, “Some goddesses live in the lives of their worshippers and die in their deaths, while some live an eternal and infinite life. My life is sustained by the world of beauty which you will see where ever you rest your eyes, and this beauty is nature itself; it is the beginning of the shepherds joy among the hills, and a villagers happiness in the fields, and the pleasure of the awe filled tribes between the mountains and the plains. This Beauty promotes the wise into the throne the truth.”

Then I said, “Beauty is a terrible power！” And she retorted, “Human beings fear all things, even yourselves. You fear heaven, the source of spiritual peace; you fear nature, the haven of rest and tranquillity; you fear the God of goodness and accuse him of anger, while he is full of love and mercy.”

After a deep silence, mingled with sweet dreams, I asked, “Speak to me of that beauty which the people interpret and define, each one according to his own conception; I have seen her honoured and worshipped in different ways and manners.”

She answered, “Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive. When you meet Beauty, you feel that the hands deep within your inner self are stretched forth to bring her into the domain of your heart. It is the magnificence combined of sorrow and joy; it is the Unseen which you see, and the Vague which you understand, and the Mute which you hear—it is the Holy of Holies that begins in yourself and ends vastly beyond your earthly imagination.”

Then the Nymph of the Jungle approached me and laid her scented hands upon my eyes. And as she withdrew, I found me alone in the valley. When I returned to the city, whose turbulence no longer vexed me, I repeated her words： “Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive.”





The Palace and the Hut





Part One


As night fell and the light glittered in the great house, the servants stood at the massive door awaiting the coming of the guests; and upon their velvet garments shown golden buttons.

The magnificent carriages drew into the palace park and the nobles entered, dressed in gorgeous raiment and decorated with jewels. The instruments filled the air with pleasant melodies while the dignitaries danced to the soothing music.

At midnight the finest and most palatable foods were served on a beautiful table embellished with all kinds of the rarest flowers. The feasters dined and drank abundantly, until the sequence of the wine began to play its part. At dawn the throng dispersed boisterously, after spending a long night of intoxication and gluttony which hurried their worn bodies into their deep beds with unnatural sleep.





Part Two


At eventide, a man attired in the dress of heavy work stood before the door of his small house and knocked at the door. As it opened, he entered and greeted the occupants in a cheerful manner, and then sat between his children who were playing at the fireplace. In a short time, his wife had the meal prepared and they sat at a wooden table consuming their food. After eating they gathered around the oil lamp and talked of the day's events. When the early night had lapsed, all stood silently and surrendered themselves to the King of Slumber with a song of praise and a prayer of gratitude on their lips.





Two Infants


A prince stood on the balcony of his palace addressing a great multitude summoned for the occasion and said, “Let me offer you and this whole fortunate country my congratulations upon the birth of a new prince who will carry the name of my noble family, and of whom you will be justly proud. He is the new bearer of a great and illustrious ancestry, and upon him depends the brilliant future of this realm. Sing and be merry！” The voices of the throngs, full of joy and thankfulness, flooded the sky with exhilarating song, welcoming the new tyrant who would affix the yoke of oppression to their necks by ruling the weak with bitter authority, and exploiting their bodies and killing their souls. For that destiny, the people were singing and drinking ecstatically to the heady of the new Emir.

Another child entered life and that kingdom at the same time. While the crowds were glorifying the strong and belittling themselves by singing praise to a potential despot, and while the angels of heaven were weeping over the people's weakness and servitude, a sick woman was thinking. She lived in an old, deserted hovel and, lying in her hard bed beside her newly born infant wrapped with ragged swaddles, was starving to death. She was a penurious and miserable young wife neglected by humanity; her husband had fallen into the trap of death set by the prince's oppression, leaving a solitary woman to whom God had sent, that night, a tiny companion to prevent her from working and sustaining life.

As the mass dispersed and silence was restored to the vicinity, the wretched woman placed the infant on her lap and looked into his face and wept as if she were to baptize him with tears. And with a hunger weakened voice she spoke to the child saying, “Why have you left the spiritual world and come to share with me the bitterness of earthly life? Why have you deserted the angels and the spacious firmament and come to this miserable land of humans, filled with agony, oppression, and heartlessness? I have nothing to give you except tears; will you be nourished on tears instead of milk? I have no silk clothes to put on you; will my naked, shivering arms give you warmth? The little animals graze in the pasture and return safely to their shed; and the small birds pick the seeds and sleep placidly between the branches. But you, my beloved, have naught save a loving but destitute mother.”

Then she took the infant to her withered breast and clasped her arms around him as if wanting to join the two bodies in one, as before. She lifted her burning eyes slowly toward heaven and cried, “God！Have mercy on my unfortunate countrymen！”

At that moment the clouds floated from the face of the moon, whose beams penetrated the transom of that poor home and fell upon two corpses.





Leave Me, My Blamer


Leave me, my blamer,

For the sake of the love

Which unites your soul with

That of your beloved one;

For the sake of that which

Joins spirit with mothers

Affection, And ties your

Heart with filial love. Go,

And leave me to my own

Weeping heart.




Let me sail in the ocean of

My dreams; Wait until Tomorrow

Comes, for tomorrow is free to

Do with me as he wishes. Your

Laying is naught but shadow

That walks with the spirit to

The tomb of abashment, and shows

Heard the cold, solid earth.




I have a little heart within me

And I like to bring him out of

His prison and carry him on the

Palm of my hand to examine him

In depth and extract his secret.

Aim not your arrows at him, lest

He takes fright and vanish 'ere he

Pours the secret blood as a

Sacrifice at the altar of his

Own faith, given him by Deity

When he fashioned him of love and beauty.




The sun is rising and the nightingale

Is singing, and the myrtle is

Breathing its fragrance into space.

I want to free myself from the

Quilted slumber of wrong.

Do not Detain me, my blamer！




Cavil me not by mention of the

Lions of the forest or the

Snakes of the valley, for

Me soul knows no fear of earth and

Accepts no warning of evil before

Evil comes.




Advise me not, my blamer, for

Calamities have opened my heart and

Tears have cleansed my eyes, and

Errors have taught me the language

Of the hearts.




Talk not of banishment, for conscience

Is my judge And he will justify me

And protect me if I am innocent, and

Will deny me of life if I am a criminal.




Love's procession is moving;

Beauty is waving her banner;

Youth is sounding the trumpet of joy;

Disturb not my contrition, my blamer.

Let me walk, for the path is rich

With roses and mint, and the air

Is scented with cleanliness.




Relate not the tales of wealth and

Greatness, for my soul is rich

With bounty and great with God's glory.




Speak not of peoples and laws and

Kingdoms, for the whole earth is

My birthplace and all humans are

My brothers.




Go from me, for you are taking away

Life—giving repentance and bringing

Needless words.





A Lover's Call


Where are you, my beloved? Are you in that little

Paradise, watering the flowers who look upon you

As infants look upon the breast of their mothers?




Or are you in your chamber where the shrine of

Virtue has been placed in your honour, and upon

Which you offer my heart and soul as sacrifice?




Or amongst the books, seeking human knowledge,

While you are replete with heavenly wisdom?




Oh companion of my soul, where are you? Are you

Praying in the temple? Or calling Nature in the

Field, haven of your dreams?




Are you in the huts of the poor, consoling the

Broken-hearted with the sweetness of your soul, and

Filling their hands with your bounty?




You are God's spirit everywhere;

You are stronger than the ages.




Do you have memory of the day we met, when the halo of

Your spirit surrounded us, and the Angels of Love

Floated about, singing the praise of the soul's deed?




Do you recollect our sitting in the shade of the

Branches, sheltering ourselves from humanity, as the ribs

Protect the divine secret of the heart from injury?




Remember you the trails and forest we walked, with hands

Joined, and our heads leaning against each other, as if

We were hiding ourselves within ourselves?




Recall you the hour I bade you farewell,

And the Maritime kiss you placed on my lips?

That kiss taught me that joining of lips in love

Reveals heavenly secrets which the tongue cannot utter！




That kiss was introduction to a great sigh,

Like the Almighty's breath that turned earth into man.




That sigh led my way into the spiritual world

Announcing the glory of my soul; and there

It shall perpetuate until again we meet.




I remember when you kissed me and kissed me,

With tears coursing your cheeks, and you said,

“Earthly bodies must often separate for earthly purpose,

And must live apart impelled by worldly intent.




“But the spirit remains joined safely in the hands of

Love, until death arrives and takes joined souls to God.

“Go, my beloved; love has chosen you her delegate;

Over her, for she is beauty who offers to her follower

The cup of the sweetness of life.

As for my own empty arms, your love shall remain my

Comforting groom; you memory, my eternal wedding.”




Where are you now, my other self? Are you awake in

The silence of the night? Let the clean breeze convey

To you my heart's every beat and affection.




Are you fondling my face in your memory? That image

Is no longer my own, for Sorrow has dropped his

Shadow on my happy countenance of the past.




Sobs have withered my eyes which reflected your beauty

And dried my lips which you sweetened with kisses.




Where are you, my beloved? Do you hear my weeping

From beyond the ocean? Do you understand my need?

Do you know the greatness of my patience?




Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying

To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any

Secret communication between angels that will carry to

You my complaint?




Where are you, my beautiful star? The obscurity of life

Has cast me upon its bosom; sorrow has conquered me.




Sail your smile into the air; it will reach and enliven me！

Breathe your fragrance into the air; it will sustain me！




Where are you, my beloved?

Oh, how great is Love！

And how little am I！





The Criminal


A young man of strong body, weakened by hunger, sat on the walker's portion of the street stretching his hand toward all who passed, begging and repeating his hand toward all who passed, begging and repeating the sad song of his defeat in life, while suffering from hunger and from humiliation.

When night came, his lips and tongue were parched, while his hand was still as empty as his stomach.

He gathered himself and went out from the city, where he sat under a tree and wept bitterly. Then he lifted his puzzled eyes to heaven while hunger was eating his inside, and he said, “Oh Lord, I went to the rich man and asked for employment, but he turned me away because of my shabbiness; I knocked at the school door, but was forbidden solace because I was empty-handed; I sought any occupation that would give me bread, but all to no avail. In desperation I asked alms, but They worshippers saw me and said ‘He is strong and lazy, and he should not beg.’

“Oh Lord, it is Thy will that my mother gave birth unto me, and now the earth offers me back to You before the Ending.”

His expression then changed. He arose and his eyes now glittered in determination. He fashioned a thick and heavy stick from the branch of the tree, and pointed it toward the city, shouting, “I asked for bread with all the strength of my voice, and was refused. Not I shall obtain it by the strength of my muscles！I asked for bread in the name of mercy and love, but humanity did not heed. I shall take it now in the name of evil！”

The passing years rendered the youth a robber, killer and destroyer of souls; he crushed all who opposed him; he amassed fabulous wealth with which he won himself over to those in power. He was admired by colleagues, envied by other thieves, and feared by the multitudes.

His riches and false position prevailed upon the Emir to appoint him deputy in that city—the sad process pursued by unwise governors. Thefts were then legalized; oppression was supported by authority; crushing of the weak became commonplace; the throngs curried and praised.

Thus does the first touch of humanity's selfishness make criminals of the humble, and make killers of the sons of peace; thus does the early greed of humanity grow and strike back at humanity a thousand fold！





The House of Fortune


My wearied heart bade me farewell and left for the House of Fortune. As he reached that holy city which the soul had blessed and worshipped, he commenced wondering, for he could not find what he had always imagined would be there. The city was empty of power, money, and authority.

And my heart spoke to the daughter of Love saying, “Oh Love, where can I find Contentment? I heard that she had come here to join you.”

And the daughter of Love responded, “Contentment has already gone to preach her gospel in the city, where greed and corruption are paramount; we are not in need of her.”

Fortune craves not Contentment, for it is an earthly hope, and its desires are embraced by union with objects, while Contentment is naught but heartfelt.

The eternal soul is never contented; it ever seeks exaltation. Then my heart looked upon Life of Beauty and said： “Thou art all knowledge; enlighten me as to the mystery of Woman.” And he answered, “Oh human heart, woman is your own reflection, and whatever you are, she is; wherever you live, she lives; she is like religion if not interpreted by the ignorant, and like a moon, if not veiled with clouds, and like a breeze, if not poisoned with impurities.”

And my heart walked toward Knowledge, the daughter of Love and Beauty, and said, “Bestow upon me wisdom, that I might share it with the people.” And she responded, “Say not wisdom, but rather fortune, for real fortune comes not from outside, but begins in the Holy of Holies of life. Share of thyself with the people.”





Two Wishes


In the silence of the night Death descended from God toward the earth. He hovered above a city and pierced the dwellings with his eyes. He say the spirits floating on wings of dreams, and the people who were surrendered to the Slumber.

When the moon fell below the horizon and the city became black, Death walked silently among the houses—careful to touch nothing—until he reached a palace. He entered through the bolted gates undisturbed, and stood by the rich man's bed; and as Death touched his forehead, the sleeper's eyes opened, showing great fright.

When he saw the spectre, he summoned a voice mingled with fear and anger, and said, “God away, oh horrible dream; leave me, you dreadful ghost. Who are you? How did you enter this place? What do you want? Leave this place at once, for I am the lord of the house and will call my slaves and guards, and order them to kill you！”

Then Death spoke, softly but with smouldering thunder, “I am Death. Stand and bow！”

The man responded, “What do you want? What have you come here when I have not yet finished my affairs? What see you from strength such as mine? Go to the weak man, and take him away！

“I loathe the sight of your bloody paws and hollow face, and my eyes take sick at your horrible ribbed winds and cadaverous body.”

After a moment of fearful realization he added, “No, No, oh merciful Death！Mind not talk, for even fear reveals what the heart forbids.

“Take a bushelful of my gold, or a handful of my slave's souls, but leave me. I have accounts with Life requiring settling; I have due from people much gold; my ships have not reached the harbour; my demand, but spare my life. Death, I own harems of supernatural beauty; your choice is my gift to you. Give heed, Death—I have but one child, and I love him dearly for he is my only joy in this life. I offer supreme sacrifice—take him, but spare me！”

Death murmured, “You are not rich, but pitifully poor.” Then Death took the hand of that earthly slave, removed his reality, and gave to the angels the heavy task of correction.

And Death walked slowly amidst the dwellings of the poor until he reached the most miserable he could find. He entered and approached a bed upon which a youth slept fitfully. Death touched his eyes; the lad sprang up as he saw Death standing by, and, with a voice full of love and hope he said, “Here I am, my beautiful Death. Accept my soul, for you are the hope of my dreams. Be their accomplishment！Embrace me, oh beloved Death！You are merciful; do not leave me. You are God's messenger; deliver me to Him. You are the right hand of Truth and the heart of Kindness; do not neglect me.

“I have begged for you many times, but you did not come; I have sought you, but you avoided me; I called out to you, but you listened not. You hear me now—embrace my soul, beloved Death！”

Death placed his softened hand upon the trembling lips, removed all reality, and enfolded it beneath his wings for secure conduct. And returning to the sky, Death looked back and whispered his warning：

“Only those return to Eternity.

Who on earth seek out Eternity.”





The Playground of Life


One hour devoted to the pursuit of Beauty

And Love is worth a full century of glory

Given by the frightened weak to the strong.




From that hour comes man's Truth; and

During that century Truth sleeps between

The restless arms of disturbing dreams.




In that hour the soul sees for herself

The Natural law, and for that century she

Imprisons herself behind the law of man;

And she is shackled with irons of oppression.




That hour was the inspiration of the Songs

Of Solomon, and that century was the blind

Power which destroyed the temple of Baalbek.




That hour was the birth of the Sermon on the

Mount, and that century wrecked the castles of

Palmyra and the Tower of Babylon.




That hour was the Hegira of Mohammed and that

Century forgot Allah, Golgotha, and Sinai.

One hour devoted to mourning and lamenting the

Stolen equality of the weak is nobler than a

Century filled with greed and usurpation.




It is at that hour when the heart is

Purified by flaming sorrow and

Illuminated by the torch of Love.

And in that century, desires for truth

Are buried in the bosom of the earth.

That hour is the root which must flourish.

That hour of meditation, the hour of

Prayer, and the hour of a new era of good.




And that century is a life of Nero spent

On self? investment taken solely from

Earthly substance.




This is life.

Portrayed on the stage for ages;

Recorded earthly for centuries;

Lived in strangeness for years;

Sung as a hymn for days;

Exalted but for an hour, but the

Hour is treasured by Eternity as a jewel.





Peace


The tempest calmed after bending the branches of the trees and leaning heavily upon the grain in the field. The stars appeared as broken remnants of lightning, but now silence prevailed over all, as if Nature's war had never been fought.

At that hour a young woman entered her chamber and knelt by her bed sobbing bitterly. Her heart flamed with agony but she could finally open her lips and say, “Oh Lord, bring him home safely to me. I have exhausted my tears and can offer no more, oh Lord, full of love and mercy. My patience is drained and calamity is seeking possession of my heart. Save him, oh Lord, from the iron paws of War; deliver him from such unmerciful Death, for he is weak, governed by the strong. Oh Lord, save my beloved, who is Thine own son, from the foe, who is Thy foe. Keep him from the forced pathway to Death's door; let him see me, or come and take me to him.”

Quietly a young man entered. His head was wrapped in bandage soaked with escaping life.

He approached he with a greeting of tears and laughter, then took her hand and placed against it his flaming lips. And with a voice with bespoke past sorrow, and joy of union, and uncertainty of her reaction, he said, “Fear me not, for I am the object of your plea. Be glad, for Peace has carried me back safely to you, and humanity has restored what greed essayed to take from us. Be not sad, but smile, my beloved. Do not express bewilderment, for Love has power that dispels Death; charm that conquers the enemy. I am your one. Think me not a spectre emerging from the House of Death to visit your Home of Beauty.

“Do not be frightened, for I am now Truth, spared from swords and fire to reveal to the people the triumph of Love over War. I am Word uttering introduction to the play of happiness and peace.”

Then the young man became speechless and his tears spoke the language of the heart; and the angels of Joy hovered about that dwelling, and the two hearts restored the singleness which had been taken from them.

At dawn the two stood in the middle of the field contemplating the beauty of Nature injured by the tempest. After a deep and comforting silence, the soldier said to his sweetheart, “Look at the Darkness, giving birth to the Sun.”





The Poet


He is a link between this and the coming world.

He is

A pure spring from which all thirsty souls may drink.




He is a tree watered by the River of Beauty, bearing

Fruit which the hungry heart craves;

He is a nightingale, soothing the depressed

Spirit with his beautiful melodies;

He is a white cloud appearing over the horizon,

Ascending and growing until it fills the face of the sky.

Then it falls on the flows in the field of Life,

Opening their petals to admit the light.

He is an angel, Sent by the goddess to

Preach the Deity's gospel;

He is a brilliant lamp, unconquered by darkness

And inextinguishable by the wind. It is filled with

Oil by Ihstar of Love, And lighted by Apollon of Music.




He is a solitary figure, robed in simplicity and

Kindness; He sits upon the lap of Nature to draw his

Inspiration, and stays up in the silence of the night,

Awaiting the descending of the spirit.




He is a sower who sows the seeds of his heart in the

Prairies of affection, and humanity reaps the

Harvest for her nourishment.




This is the poet—whom the people ignore in this life,

And who is recognized only when he bids the earthly

World farewell And returns to his arbour in heaven.




This is the poet—who asks naught of

Humanity but a smile

This is the poet—whose spirit ascends and

Fills the firmament with beautiful sayings;

Yet the people deny themselves his radiance.




Until when shall the people remain asleep?

Until when shall they continue to glorify those

Who attain greatness by moments of advantage?

How long shall they ignore those who enable

Them to see the beauty of their spirit,

Symbol of peace and love?

Until when shall human beings honour the dead

And forget the living, who spend their lives

Encircled in misery, and who consume themselves,

Like burning candles to illuminate the way

For the ignorant and lead them into the path of light?




Poet, you are the life of this life, And you have

Triumphed over the ages of despite their severity.




Poet, you will one day rule the hearts, and

Therefore, your kingdom has no ending.

Poet, examine your crown of thorns; You will

Find concealed in it a budding wreath of laurel.





The Beauty of Death





Part One—The Calling


Let me sleep, for my soul is intoxicated with love and

Let me rest, for my spirit has had its bounty of days and nights;

Light the candles and burn the incense around my bed, and

Scatter leaves of jasmine and roses over my body;

Embalm my hair with frankincense and sprinkle my feet with perfume,

And read what the hand of Death has written on my forehead.




Let me rest in the arms of Slumber, for my open eyes are tired;

Let the silver-stringed lyre quiver and soothe my spirit;

Weave from the harp and lute a veil around my withering heart.




Sing of the past as you behold the dawn of hope in my eyes, for

It's magic meaning is a soft bed upon which my heart rests.




Dry your tears, my friends, and raise your heads as the flowers

Raise their crowns to greet the dawn.

Look at the bride of Death standing like a column of light

Between my bed and the infinite;

Hold your breath and listen with me to the beckoning rustle of

Her white wings.




Come close and bid me farewell; touch my eyes with smiling lips.

Let the children grasp my hands with soft and rosy fingers;

Let the ages place their veined hands upon my head and bless me;

Let the virgins come close and see the shadow of God in my eyes,

And hear the echo of His will racing with my breath.





Part Two—The Ascending


I have passed a mountain peak and my soul is soaring in the

Firmament of complete and unbound freedom;

I am far, far away, my companions, and the clouds are

Hiding the hills from my eyes.

The valleys are becoming flooded with an ocean of silence, and the

Hands of oblivion are engulfing the roads and the houses;

The prairies and fields are disappearing behind a white spectre

That looks like the spring cloud, yellow as the candlelight

And red as the twilight.




The songs of the waves and the hymns of the streams

Are scattered, and the voices of the throngs reduced to silence;

And I can hear naught but the music of Eternity

In exact harmony with the spirit's desires.

I am cloaked in full whiteness;

I am in comfort; I am in peace.





Part Three—The Remains


Unwrap me from this white linen shroud and clothe me

With leaves of jasmine and lilies;

Take my body from the ivory casket and let it rest

Upon pillows of orange blossoms.

Lament me not, but sing songs of youth and joy;

Shed not tears upon me, but sing of harvest and the winepress;

Utter no sigh of agony, but draw upon my face with your

Finger the symbol of Love and Joy.

Disturb not the air's tranquillity with chanting and requiems,

But let your hearts sing with me the song of Eternal Life;

Mourn me not with apparel of black,

But dress in colour and rejoice with me;

Talk not of my departure with sighs in your hearts; close

Your eyes and you will see me with you forevermore.




Place me upon clusters of leaves and

Carry my upon your friendly shoulders and

Walk slowly to the deserted forest.

Take me not to the crowded burying ground Lest my slumber

Be disrupted by the rattling of bones and skulls.

Carry me to the cypress woods And dig my grave where violets

And poppies grow not in the other's shadow;

Let my grave be deep So that the flood will not

Carry my bones to the open valley;

Let my grace be wide, So that the twilight shadows

Will come and sit by me.




Take from me all earthly raiment And place me deep in my

Mother Earth; and place me with care upon my mother's breast.

Cover me with soft earth, And let each handful be mixed

With seeds of jasmine, lilies and myrtle; And when they

Grow above me, And thrive on my body's element they will

Breathe the fragrance of my heart into space;

And reveal even to the sun the secret of my peace;

And sail with the breeze and comfort the wayfarer.




Leave me then, friends—leave me and depart on mute feet,

As the silence walks in the deserted valley;

Leave me to God and disperse yourselves slowly, as the almond

And apple blossoms disperse under the vibration of Nisan's breeze.

Go back to the joy of your dwellings And you will find there

That which Death cannot remove from you and me.

Leave with place, for what you see here is far away in meaning

From the earthly world. Leave me.





Song of the Soul


In the depth of my soul there is

A wordless song—a song that lives

In the seed of my heart.

It refuses to melt with ink on

Parchment; it engulfs my affection

In a transparent cloak And flows

But not upon my lips.




How can I sigh it? I fear it may

Mingle with earthly ether;

To whom shall I sing it?

It dwells In the house of my soul, In fear of

Harsh ears.




When I look into my inner eyes

I see the shadow of its shadow;

When I touch my fingertips

I feel its vibrations.




The deeds of my hands heed its

Presence as a lake must reflect

The glittering stars; My tears

Reveal it, as bright drops of dew

Reveal the secret of a withering rose.

It is a song composed by contemplation,

And published by silence,

And shunned by clamour,

And folded by truth,

And repeated by dreams,

And understood by love,

And hidden by awakening,

And sung by the soul.




It is the song of love;

What Cain or Esau could sing it?




It is more fragrant than jasmine;

What voice could enslave it?




It is heartbound, as a virgin's secret;

What string could quiver it?




Who dares unite the roar of the sea

And the singing of the nightingale?

Who dares compare the shrieking tempest

To the sigh of an infant?

Who dares speak aloud the words

Intended for the heart to speak?

What human dares sing in voice

The song of God?





Song of the Wave


The strong shore is my beloved

And I am his sweetheart.

We are at last united by love, and

Then the moon draws me from him.

I go to him in haste and depart

Reluctantly, with many

Little farewells.




I steal swiftly from behind the

Blue horizon, To cast the silver of

My foam upon the gold of his sand, and

We blend in melted brilliance.




I quench his thirst and submerge his

Heart; he softens my voice and subdues

My temper.

At dawn I recite the rules of love upon

His ears, and he embraces me longingly.




At eventide I sing to him the song of

Hope, and then print smooth kisses upon

His face; I am swift and fearful, but he

Is quiet, patient, and thoughtful. His

Broad bosom soothes my restlessness.

As the tide comes we caress each other,

When it withdraws, I drop to his feet in

Prayer.




Many times have I danced around mermaids

As they rose from the depths and rested

Upon my crest to watch the stars;

Many times have I heard lovers complain

Of their smallness, And I helped them to sigh.




Many times have I teased the great rocks

And fondled them with a smile, but never

Have I received laughter from them;

Many times have I lifted drowning souls

And carried them tenderly to my beloved

Shore. He gives them strength as he

Takes mine.




Many times have I stolen gems from the

Depths and presented them to my beloved

Shore. He takes them in silence, but still

I give for he welcomes me ever.




In the heaviness of night, when all

Creatures seek the ghost of slumber, I

Sit up, singing at one time and sighing

At another. I am awake always.




Alas！Sleeplessness has weakened me！

But I am a lover, and the truth of love

Is strong.

I may be weary, but I shall never die.





Song of the Rain


I am dotted silver threads dropped from heaven

By the gods. Nature then takes me, to adorn

Her fields and valleys.




I am beautiful pearls, plucked from the

Crown of Ishtar by the daughter of Dawn

To embellish the gardens.




When I cry the hills laugh;

When I humble myself the flowers rejoice;

When I bow, all things are elated.




The field and the cloud are lovers

And between them I am a messenger of mercy.

I quench the thirst of one;

I cure the ailment of the other.




The voice of thunder declares my arrival;

The rainbow announces my departure.

I am like earthly life, which begins at

The feet of the mad elements And ends

Under the upraised wings of death.




I emerge from the heard of the sea

Soar with the breeze. When I see a field in

Need, I descend and embrace the flowers and

The trees in a million little ways.




I touch gently at the windows with my

Soft fingers, and my announcement is a

Welcome song. All can hear, but only

The sensitive can understand.




The heat in the air gives birth to me,

But in turn I kill it,

As woman overcomes man with

The strength she takes from him.




I am the sigh of the sea;

The laughter of the field;

The tears of heaven.




So with love—

Sighs from the deep sea of affection;

Laughter from the colourful field of the spirit;

Tears from the endless heaven of memories.





Song of Love


I am the lover's eyes, and the spirit's

Wine, and the heart's nourishment.

I am a rose. My heart opens at dawn and

The virgin kisses me and places me

Upon her breast.




I am the house of true fortune, and the

Origin of pleasure, and the beginning

Of peace and tranquillity. I am the gentle

Smile upon his lips of beauty. When youth

Overtakes me he forgets his toil, and his

Whole life becomes reality of sweet dreams.




I am the poet's elation,

And the artist's revelation,

And the musician's inspiration.




I am a sacred shrine in the heart of a

Child, adored by a merciful mother.




I appear to a heart's cry; I shun a demand;

My fullness pursues the heart's desire;

It shuns the empty claim of the voice.

I appeared to Adam through Eve

And exile was his lot;

Yet I revealed myself to Solomon, and

He drew wisdom from my presence.




I smiled at Helena and she destroyed Tarwada;

Yet I crowned Cleopatra and peace dominated

The Valley of the Nile.




I am like the ages—building today

And destroying tomorrow;

I am like a god, who creates and ruins;

I am sweeter than a violet's sigh;

I am more violent than a raging tempest.




Gifts alone do not entice me;

Parting does not discourage me;

Poverty does not chase me;

Jealousy does not prove my awareness;

Madness does not evidence my presence.




Oh seekers, I am Truth, beseeching Truth;

And your Truth in seeking and receiving

And protecting me shall determine my Behaviour.





Song of Fortune


Man and I are sweethearts

He craves me and I long for him,

But alas！Between us has appeared

A rival who brings us misery.

She is cruel and demanding,

Possessing empty lure.

Her name is Substance.

She follows wherever we go

And watches like a sentinel, bringing

Restlessness to my lover.




I ask for my beloved in the forest,

Under the trees, by the lakes.

I cannot find him, for Substance

Has spirited him to the clamorous

City and placed him on the throne

Of quaking, metal riches.




I call for him with the voice of

Knowledge and the song of Wisdom.

He does not hearken, for Substance

Has enticed him into the dungeon

Of selfishness, where avarice dwells.




I seek him in the field of Contentment,

But I am alone, for my rival has

Imprisoned him in the cave of gluttony

And greed, And locked him there

With painful chains of gold.




I call to him at dawn, when Nature smiles,

But he does not hear, for excess has

Laden his drugged eyes with sick slumber.




I beguile him at eventide, when Silence rules

And the flowers sleep. But he responds not,

For his fear over what the morrow will bring

Shadows his thoughts.




He yearns to love me;

He asks for me in this own acts. But he

Will find me not except in God's acts.

He seeks me in the edifices of his glory

Which he has built upon the bones of others;

He whispers to me from among

His heaps of gold and silver;

But he will find me only by coming to

The house of Simplicity Which God has built

At the brink of the stream of affection.




He desires to kiss me before his coffers,

But his lips will never touch mine, except

In the richness of the pure breeze.

He asks me to share with him his

Fabulous wealth, But I will not forsake God's

Fortune; I will not cast off my cloak of beauty.




He seeks deceit for medium; I seek only

The medium of his heart.

He bruises his heart in his narrow cell;

I would enrich his heart with all my love.




My beloved has learned how to shriek and

Cry for my enemy, Substance; I would

Teach him how to shed tears of affection

And mercy from the eyes of his soul

For all things,

And utter sighs of contentment through

Those tears.




Man is my sweetheart;

I want to belong to him.





Song of the Flower


I am a kind word uttered and repeated

By the voice of Nature;

I am a star fallen from the

Blue tent upon the green carpet.

I am the daughter of the elements

With whom winter conceived;

To whom Spring gave birth; I was

Reared in the lap of Summer and I

Slept in the bed of Autumn.




At dawn I unite with the breeze

To announce the coming of light;

At eventide I join the birds

In bidding the light farewell.




The plains are decorated with

My beautiful colours, and the air

Is scented with my fragrance.




As I embrace Slumber the eyes of

Night watch over me, and as I

Awaken I stare at the sun, which is

The only eye of the day.

I drink dew for wine, and harken to

The voices of the birds, and dance

To the rhythmic swaying of the grass.




I am the lover's gift;

I am the wedding wreath;

I am the memory of a moment of happiness;

I am the last gift of the living to the dead;

I am a part of joy and a part of sorrow.




But I look up high to see only the light,

And never look down to see my shadow.

This is wisdom which man must learn.





Song of Man


I was here from the moment of the

Beginning, and here I am still. And

I shall remain here until the end

Of the world, For there is no

Ending to my grief-stricken being.




I roamed the infinite sky, and

Soared in the ideal world, and

Floated through the firmament. But

Here I am, prisoner of measurement.




I heard the teachings of Confucius;

I listened to Brahma's wisdom;

I sat by Buddha under the Tree of Knowledge.

Yet here I am, existing with ignorance

And heresy.




I was on Sinai when Jehovah approached Moses;

I saw the Nazarene's miracles at the Jordan;

I was in Medina when Mohammed visited.

Yet I here I am, prisoner of bewilderment.




Then I witnessed the might of Babylon;

I learned of the glory of Egypt;

I viewed the warring greatness of Rome.

Yet my earlier teachings showed the

Weakness and sorrow of those achievements.




I conversed with the magicians of Ain Dour;

I debated with the priests of Assyria;

I gleaned depth from the prophets of Palestine.

Yet, I am still seeking truth.




I gathered wisdom from quiet India;

I probed the antiquity of Arabia;

I heard all that can be heard.

Yet, my heart is deaf and blind.




I suffered at the hands of despotic rulers;

I suffered slavery under insane invaders;

I suffered hunger imposed by tyranny;

Yet, I still possess some inner power

With which I struggle to greet each day.




My mind is filled, but my heart is empty;

My body is old, but my heart is an infant.

Perhaps in youth my heart will grow, but I

Pray to grow old and reach the moment of

My return to God. Only then will my heart fill！




I was here from the moment of the

Beginning, and here I am still. And

I shall remain here until the end

Of the world, for there is no

Ending to my grief-stricken being.





A Poet's Voice





Part One


The power of charity sows deep in my heart, and I reap and gather the wheat in bundles and give them to the hungry.

My soul gives life to the grapevine and I press its bunches and give the juice to the thirsty.

Heaven fills my lamp with oil and I place it at my window to direct the stranger through the dark.

I do all these things because I live in them; and if destiny should tie my hands and prevent me from so doing, then death would be my only desire. For I am a poet, and if I cannot give, I shall refuse to receive.

Humanity rages like a tempest, but I sigh in silence for I know the storm must pass away while a sigh goes to God.

Human kinds cling to earthly things, but I seek ever to embrace the torch of love so it will purify me by its fire and sear inhumanity from my heart.

Substantial things deaden a man without suffering; love awakens him with enlivening pains.

Humans are divided into different clans and tribes, and belong to countries and towns. But I find myself a stranger to all communities and belong to no settlement. The universe is my country and the human family is my tribe.

Men are weak, and it is sad that they divide amongst themselves. The world is narrow and it is unwise to cleave it into kingdoms, empires, and provinces.

Human kinds unite themselves one to destroy the temples of the soul, and they join hands to build edifices for earthly bodies. I stand alone listening to the voice of hope in my deep self saying, “As love enlivens a man's heart with pain, so ignorance teaches him the way of knowledge.” Pain and ignorance lead to great joy and knowledge because the Supreme Being has created nothing vain under the sun.





Part Two


I have a yearning for my beautiful country, and I love its people because of their misery. But if my people rose, stimulated by plunder and motivated by what they call “patriotic spirit” to murder, and invaded my neighbour's country, then upon the committing of any human atrocity I would hate my people and my country.

I sing the praise of my birthplace and long to see the home of my children; but if the people in that home refused to shelter and feed the needy wayfarer, I would convert my praise into anger and my longing to forgetfulness. My inner voice would say, “The house that does not comfort the need is worthy of naught by destruction.”

I love my native village with some of my love for my country; and I love my country with part of my love for the earth, all of which is my country; and I love the earth will all of myself because it is the haven of humanity, the manifest spirit of God.

Humanity is the spirit of the Supreme Being on earth, and that humanity is standing amidst ruins, hiding its nakedness behind tattered rags, shedding tears upon hollow cheeks, and calling for its children with pitiful voice. But the children are busy singing their clan's anthem; they are busy sharpening the swords and cannot hear the cry of their mothers.

Humanity appeals to its people but they listen not. Were one to listen, and console a mother by wiping her tears, other would say, “He is weak, affected by sentiment.”

Humanity is the spirit of the Supreme Being on earth, and that Supreme Being preaches love and good-will. But the people ridicule such teachings. The Nazarene Jesus listened, and crucifixion was his lot; Socrates heard the voice and followed it, and he too fell victim in body. The followers of The Nazarene and Socrates are the followers of Deity, and since people will not kill them, they deride them, saying, “Ridicule is more bitter than killing.”

Jerusalem could not kill The Nazarene, nor Athens Socrates; they are living yet and shall live eternally. Ridicule cannot triumph over the followers of Deity. They live and grow forever.





Part Three


Thou art my brother because you are a human, and we both are sons of one Holy Spirit; we are equal and made of the same earth.

You are here as my companion along the path of life, and my aid in understanding the meaning of hidden Truth. You are a human, and, that fact sufficing, I love you as a brother. You may speak of me as you choose, for Tomorrow shall take you away and will use your talk as evidence for his judgment, and you shall receive justice.

You may deprive me of whatever I possess, for my greed instigated the amassing of wealth and you are entitled to my lot if it will satisfy you.

You may do unto me whatever you wish, but you shall not be able to touch my Truth.

You may shed my blood and burn my body, but you cannot kill or hurt my spirit.

You may tie my hands with chains and my feet with shackles, and put me in the dark prison, but who shall not enslave my thinking, for it is free, like the breeze in the spacious sky.

You are my brother and I love you. I love you worshipping in your church, kneeling in your temple, and praying in your mosque. You and I and all are children of one religion, for the varied paths of religion are but the fingers of the loving hand of the Supreme Being, extended to all, offering completeness of spirit to all, anxious to receive all.

I love you for your Truth, derived from your knowledge; that Truth which I cannot see because of my ignorance. But I respect it as a divine thing, for it is the deed of the spirit. Your Truth shall meet my Truth in the coming world and blend together like the fragrance of flowers and becoming one whole and eternal Truth, perpetuating and living in the eternity of Love and Beauty.

I love you because you are weak before the strong oppressor, and poor before the greedy rich. For these reasons I shed tears and comfort you; and from behind my tears I see you embraced in the arms of Justice, smiling and forgiving your persecutors. You are my brother and I love you.





Part Four


You are my brother, but why are you quarrelling with me? Why do you invade my country and try to subjugate me for the sake of pleasing those who are seeking glory and authority?

Why do you leave your wife and children and follow Death to the distant land for the sake of those who buy glory with your blood, and high honour with your mother's tears?

Is it an honour for a man to kill his brother man? If you deem it an honour, let it be an act of worship, and erect a temple to Cain who slew his brother Abel.

Is self-preservation the first law of Nature? Why, then, does Greed urge you to self-sacrifice in order only to achieve his aim in hurting your brothers? Beware, my brother, of the leader who says, “Love of existence obliges us to deprive the people of their rights！” I say unto you but this：protecting others' rights is the noblest and most beautiful human act; if my existence requires that I kill others, then death is more honourable to me, and if I cannot find someone to kill me for the protection of my honour, I will not hesitate to take my life by my own hands for the sake of Eternity before Eternity comes.

Selfishness, my brother, is the cause of blind superiority, and superiority creates clanship, and clanship creates authority which leads to discord and subjugation.

The soul believes in the power of knowledge and justice over dark ignorance; it denies the authority that supplies the swords to defend and strengthen ignorance and oppression−−that authority which destroyed Babylon and shook the foundation of Jerusalem and left Rome in ruins. It is that which made people call criminals great mean; made writers respect their names; made historians relate the stories of their inhumanity in manner of praise.

The only authority I obey is the knowledge of guarding and acquiescing in the Natural Law of Justice.

What justice does authority display when it kills the killer? When it imprisons the robber? When it descends on a neighbourhood country and slays its people? What does justice think of the authority under which a killer punishes the one who kills, and a thief sentences the one who steals?

You are my brother, and I love you; and Love is justice with its full intensity and dignity. If justice did not support my love for you, regardless of your tribe and community, I would be a deceiver concealing the ugliness of selfishness behind the outer garment of pure love.





Conclusion


My soul is my friend who consoles me in misery and distress of life. He who does not befriend his soul is an enemy of humanity, and he who does not find human guidance within himself will perish desperately. Life emerges from within, and derives not from environs.

I came to say a word and I shall say it now. But if death prevents its uttering, it will be said by Tomorrow, for Tomorrow never leaves a secret in the book of Eternity.

I came to live in the glory of Love and the light of Beauty, which are the reflections of God. I am here living, and the people are unable to exile me from the domain of life for they know I will live in death. If they pluck my eyes I will hearken to the murmurs of Love and the songs of Beauty.

If they close my ears I will enjoy the touch of the breeze mixed with the incense of Love and the fragrance of Beauty.

If they place me in a vacuum, I will live together with my soul, the child of Love and Beauty.

I came here to be for all and with all, and what I do today in my solitude will be echoed by Tomorrow to the people.

What I say now with one heart will be said tomorrow by many hearts.





The Wanderer





The Wanderer


I met him at the crossroads, a man with but a cloak and a staff, and a veil of pain upon his face. And we greeted one another, and I said to him, “Come to my house and be my guest.”

And he came.

My wife and my children met us at the threshold, and he smiled at them, and they loved his coming.

Then we all sat together at the board and we were happy with the man for there was a silence and a mystery in him.

And after supper we gathered to the fire and I asked him about his wanderings.

He told us many a tale that night and also the next day, but what I now record was born out of the bitterness of his days though he himself was kindly, and these tales are of the dust and patience of his road.

And when he left us after three days we did not feel that a guest had departed but rather that one of us was still out in the garden and had not yet come in.





Garments


Upon a day Beauty and Ugliness met on the shore of a sea. And they said to one another, “Let us bathe in the sea.”

Then they disrobed and swam in the waters. And after a while Ugliness came back to shore and garmented himself with the garments of Beauty and walked away.

And Beauty too came out of the sea, and found not her raiment, and she was too shy to be naked, therefore she dressed herself with the raiment of Ugliness. And Beauty walked her way.

And to this very day men and women mistake the one for the other.

Yet some there are who have beheld the face of Beauty, and they know her notwithstanding her garments. And some there be who know the face of Ugliness, and the cloth conceals him not from their eyes.





The Eagle and the Skylark


A skylark and an eagle met on a rock upon a high hill. The skylark said, “Good morrow to you, Sir.” And the eagle looked down upon him and said faintly, “Good morrow.”

And the skylark said, “I hope all things are well with you, Sir.”

“Aye,” said the eagle, “all is well with us. But do you not know that we are the king of birds, and that you shall not address us before we ourselves have spoken?”

Said the skylark, “Methinks we are of the same family.”

The eagle looked upon him with disdain and he said, “Who ever has said that you and I are of the same family?”

Then said the shylark, “But I would remind you of this, I can fly even as high as you, and I can sing and give delight to the other creatures of this earth. And you give neither pleasure nor delight.”

Then the eagle was angered, and he said, “Pleasure and delight！You little presumptuous creature！With one thrust of my beak I could destroy you. You are but the size of my foot.”

Then the skylark flew up and alighted upon the back of the eagle and began to pick at his feathers. The eagle was annoyed, and he flew swift and high that he might rid himself of the little bird. But he failed to do so. At last he dropped back to that very rock upon the high hill, more fretted than ever, with the little creature still upon his back, and cursing the fate of the hour.

Now at that moment a small turtle came by and laughed at the sight, and laughed so hard the she almost turned upon her back.

And the eagle looked down upon the turtle and he said, “You slow creeping thing, ever one with the earth, what are you laughing at?”

And the turtle said, “Why I see that you are turned horse, and that you have a small bird riding you, but the small bird is the better bird.”

And the eagle said to her, “Go you about your business. This is a family affair between my brother, the lark, and myself.”





The Love Song


A poet once wrote a love song and it was beautiful. And he made many copies of it, and sent them to his friends and his acquaintances, both men and women, and even to a young woman whom he had met but once, who lived beyond the mountains.

And in a day or two a messenger came from the young woman bringing a letter. And in the letter she said, “Let me assure you, I am deeply touched by the love song that you have written to me. Come now, and see my father and my mother, and we shall make arrangements for the betrothal.”

And the poet answered the letter, and he said to her, “My friend, it was but a song of love out of a poet's heart, sung by every man to every woman.”

And she wrote again to him saying, “Hypocrite and liar in words！From this day unto my coffin-day I shall hate all poets for your sake.”





Tears and Laughter


Upon the bank of the Nile at eventide, a hyena met a crocodile and they stopped and greeted one another.

The hyena spoke and said, “How goes the day with you, Sir?”

And the crocodile answered saying, “It goes badly with me. Sometimes in my pain and sorrow I weep, and then the creatures always say, ‘They are but crocodile tears.’ And this wounds me beyond all telling.”

Then the hyena said, “You speak of your pain and your sorrow, but think of me also, for a moment. I gaze at the beauty of the world, its wonders and its miracles, and out of sheer joy I laugh even as the day laughs. And then the people of the jungle say, ‘It is but the laughter of a hyena.’”





At The Fair


There came to the Fair a girl from the country-side, most comely. There was a lily and a rose in her face. There was a sunset in her hair, and dawn smiled upon her lips.

No sooner did the lovely stranger appear in their sight than the young men sought her and surrounded her. One would dance with her, and another would cut a cake in her honor. And they all desired to kiss her cheek. For after all, was it not the Fair?

But the girl was shocked and started, and she thought ill of the young men. She rebuked them, and she even struck one or two of them in the face. Then she ran away from them.

And on her way home that evening she was saying in her heart, “I am disgusted. How unmannerly and ill bred are these men. It is beyond all patience.”

A year passed during which that very comely girl thought much of Fairs and men. Then she came again to the Fair with the lily and the rose in her face, the sunset in her hair and the smile of dawn upon her lips.

But now the young men, seeing her, turned from her. And all the day long she was unsought and alone.

And at eventide as she walked the road toward her home she cried in her heart, “I am disgusted. How unmannerly and ill bred are these youths. It is beyond all patience.”





The Two Princesses


In the city of Shawakis lived a prince, and he was loved by everyone, men and women and children. Even the animals of the field came unto him in greeting.

But all the people said that his wife, the princess, loved him not; nay, that she even hated him.

And upon a day the princess of a neighboring city came to visit the princess of Shawakis. And they sat and talked together, and their words led to their husbands.

And the princess of Sharakis said with passion, “I envy you your happiness with the prince, your husband, though you have been married these many years. I hate my husband. He belongs not to me alone, and I am indeed a woman most unhappy.”

Then the visiting princess gazed at her and said, “My friend, the truth is that you love your husband. Aye, and you still have him for a passion unspent, and that is life in woman like unto Spring in a garden. But pity me, and my husband, for we do but endure one another in silent patience. And yet you and others deem this happiness.”





The Lightning Flash


There was a Christian bishop in his cathedral on a stormy day, and an un-Christian woman came and stood before him, and she said, “I am not a Christian. Is there salvation for me from hell-fire?”

And the bishop looked upon the woman, and he answered her saying, “Nay, there is salvation for those only who are baptized of water and of the spirit.”

And even as he spoke a bolt from the sky fell with thunder upon the cathedral and it was filled with fire.

And the men of the city came running, and they saved the woman, but the bishop was consumed, food of the fire.





The Hermit and the Beasts


Once there lived among the green hills a hermit. He was pure of spirit and white of heart. And all the animals of the land and all the fowls of the air came to him in pairs and he spoke unto them. They heard him gladly, and they would gather near unto him, and would not go until nightfall, when he would send them away, entrusting them to the wind and the woods with his blessing.

Upon an evening as he was speaking of love, a leopard raised her head and said to the hermit, “You speak to us of loving. Tell us, Sir, where is your mate?”

And the hermit said, “I have no mate.”

Then a great cry of surprise rose from the company of beasts and fowls, and they began to say among themselves, “How can he tell us of loving and mating when he himself knows naught thereof?” And quietly and in distain they left him alone.

That night the hermit lay upon his mat with his face earthward, and he wept bitterly and beat his hands upon his breast.





The Prophet and the Child


Once on a day the prophet Sharia met a child in a garden. The child ran to him and said, “Good morrow to you, Sir,” and the prophet said, “Good morrow to you, Sir.” And in a moment, “I see that you are alone.”

Then the child said, in laughter and delight, “It took a long time to lose my nurse. She thinks I am behind those hedges; but can't you see that I am here?” Then he gazed at the prophet's face and spoke again. “You are alone, too. What did you do with your nurse?”

The prophet answered and said, “Ah, that is a different thing. In very truth I cannot lose her oftentime. But now, when I came into this garden, she was seeking after me behind the hedges.”

The child clapped his hands and cried out, “So you are like me！Isn't it good to be lost?” And then he said, “Who are you?”

And the man answered, “They call me the prophet Sharia. And tell me, who are you?”

“I am only myself,” said the child, “and my nurse is seeking after me, and she does not know where I am.”

Then the prophet gazed into space saying, “I too have escaped my nurse for awhile, but she will find me out.”

And the child said, “I know mine will find me out too.”

At that moment a woman's voice was heard calling the child's name, “See,” said the child, “I told you she would be finding me.”

And at the same moment another voice was heard, “Where art thou, Sharia?”

And the prophet said, “See my child, they have found me also.”

And turning his face upward, Sharia answered, “Here I am.”





The Pearl


Said one oyster to a neighboring oyster, “I have a very great pain within me. It is heavy and round and I am in distress.”

And the other oyster replied with haughty complacence, “Praise be to the heavens and to the sea, I have no pain within me. I am well and whole both within and without.”

At that moment a crab was passing by and heard the two oysters, and he said to the one who was well and whole both within and without, “Yes, you are well and whole; but the pain that your neighbor bears is a pearl of exceeding beauty.”





Body and Soul


A man and a woman sat by a window that opened upon Spring. They sat close one unto the other. And the woman said, “I love you. You are handsome, and you are rich, and you are always well-attired.”

And the man said, “I love you. You are a beautiful thought, a thing too apart to hold in the hand, and a song in my dreaming.”

But the woman turned from him in anger, and she said, “Sir, please leave me now. I am not a thought, and I am not a thing that passes in your dreams. I am a woman. I would have you desire me, a wife, and the mother of unborn children.”

And they parted. And the man was saying in his heart, “Behold another dream is even now turned into mist.”

And the woman was saying, “Well, what of a man who turns me into a mist and a dream?”





The King


The people of the kingdom of Sadik surrounded the palace of their king shouting in rebellion against him. And he came down the steps of the palace carrying his crown in one hand and his sceptre in the other. The majesty of his appearance silenced the multitude, and he stood before them and said, “My friends, who are no longer my subjects, here I yield my crown and sceptre unto you. I would be one of you. I am only one man, but as a man I would work together with you that our lot may be made better. There is no need for king. Let us go therefore to the fields and the vineyards and labor hand with hand. Only you must tell me to what field or vineyard I should go. All of you now are king.”

And the people marveled, and stillness was upon them, for the king whom they had deemed the source of their discontent now yielding his crown and sceptre to them and became as one of them.

Then each and every one of them went his way, and the king walked with one man to a field.

But the Kingdom of Sadik fared not better without a king, and the mist of discontent was still upon the land. The people cried out in the market places saying that they have a king to rule them. And the elders and the youths said as if with one voice, “We will have our king.”

And they sought the king and found him toiling in the field, and they brought him to his seat, and yielded unto his crown and his sceptre. And they said, “Now rule us, with might and with justice.”

And he said, “I will indeed rule you with might, and may the gods of the heaven and the earth help me that I may also rule with justice.”

Now, there came to his presence men and women and spoke unto him of a baron who mistreated them, and to whom they were but serfs.

And straightway the king brought the baron before him and said, “The life of one man is as weighty in the scales of God as the life of another. And because you know not how to weigh the lives of those who work in your fiends and your vineyards, you are banished, and you shall leave this kingdom forever.”

The following day came another company to the king and spoke of the cruelty of a countess beyond the hills, and how she brought them down to misery. Instantly the countess was brought to court, and the king sentenced her also to banishment, saying, “Those who till our fields and care for our vineyards are nobler than we who eat the bread they prepare and drink the wine of their wine-press. And because you know not this, you shall leave this land and be afar from this kingdom.”

Then came men and women who said that the bishop made them bring stones and hew the stones for the cathedral, yet he gave them naught, though they knew the bishop's coffer was full of gold and silver while they themselves were empty with hunger.

And the king called for the bishop, and when the bishop came the king spoke and said unto his, “That cross you wear upon your bosom should mean giving life unto life. But you have taken life from life and you have given none. Therefore you shall leave this kingdom never to return.”

Thus each day for a full moon men and women came to the king to tell him of the burdens laid upon them. And each and every day a full moon some oppressor was exiled from the land.

And the people of Sadik were amazed, and there was cheer in their heart.

And upon a day the elders and the youths came and surrounded the tower of the king and called for him. And he came down holding his crown with one hand and his sceptre with the other.

And he spoke unto and said, “Now, what would you do of me? Behold, I yield back to you that which you desired me to hold.”

But they cried. “Nay, nay, you are our rightful king. You have made clean the land of vipers, and you have brought the wolves to naught, and we welcome to sing our thanksgiving unto you. The crown is yours in majesty and the sceptre is yours in glory.”

Then the king said, “Not I, not I. You yourselves are king. When you deemed me weak and a misruler, you yourselves were weak and misruling. And now the land fares well because it is in your will. I am but a thought in the mind of you all, and I exist not save in your actions. There is no such person as governor. Only the governed exist to govern themselves.”

And the king re-entered his tower with his crown and his sceptre. And the elders and the youths went their various ways and they were content.

And each and every one thought of himself as king with a crown in one hand and a sceptre in the other.





Upon The Sand


Said one man to another, “At the high tide of the sea, long ago, with the point of my staff I wrote a line upon the sand; and the people still pause to read it, and they are careful that naught shall erase it.”

And the other man said, “And I too wrote a line upon the sand, but it was at low tide, and the waves of the vast sea washed it away. But tell me, what did you write?”

And the first man answered and said, “I wrote this：‘I am he who is.’ But what did you write?”

And the other man said, “This I wrote：‘I am but a drop of this great ocean.’”





The Three Gifts


Once in the city of Becharre there lived a gracious prince who was loved and honored by all his subjects.

But there was one exceedingly poor man who was bitter against the prince, and who wagged continually a pestilent tongue in his dispraise.

The prince knew this, yet he was patient.

But at last he bethought him; and upon a wintry night there came to the door of the man a servant of the prince, bearing a sack of flour, a bag of soap and a cone of sugar.

And the servant said, “The prince sends you these gifts in token of rememberance.”

The man was elated, for he thought the gifts were an homage from the prince. And in his pride we went to the bishop and told him what the prince had done, saying, “Can you not see how the prince desires my goodwill?”

But the bishop said, “Oh, how wise a prince, and how little you understand. He speaks in symbols. The flour is for your empty stomach; the soap is for your dirty hide; and the sugar is to sweeten your bitter tongue.”

From that day forward the man became shy even of himself. His hatred of the prince was greater than ever, and even more he hated the bishop who had revealed the prince unto him.

But thereafter he kept silent.





Peace and War


Three dogs were basking in the sun and conversing. The first dog said dreamily, “It is indeed wondrous to be living in this day of dogdom. Consider the ease with which we travel under the sea, upon the earth and even in the sky. And meditate for a moment upon the inventions brought forth for the comfort of dogs, even for our eyes and ears and noses.”

And the second dog spoke and he said, “We are more heedful of the arts. We bark at the moon more rhythmically than did our forefathers. And when we gaze at ourselves in the water we see that our features are clearer than the features of yesterday.”

Then the third dog spoke and said, “But what interests me most and beguiles my mind is the tranquil understanding existing between dogdoms.”

At that very moment they looked, and lo, the dog-catcher was approaching.

The three dogs sprang up and scampered down the street; and as they ran the third dog said, “For God's sake, run for your lives. Civilization is after us.”





The Dancer


Once there came to the court of the Prince of Birkasha a dancer with her musicians. And she was admitted to the court, and she danced before the prince to the music the lute and the flute and the zither.

She danced the dance of flames, and the dance of swords and spears; she danced the dance of stars and the dance of space. And then she danced the dance of flowers in the wind.

After this she stood before the throne of the prince and bowed her body before him. And the prince bade her to come nearer, and he said unto her, “Beautiful woman, daughter of grace and delight, whence comes your art? And how is it that you command all the elements in your rhythms and your rhymes?”

And the dancer bowed again before the prince, and she answered, “Mighty and gracious Majesty, I know not the answer to your questionings. Only this I know：The philosopher's soul dwells in his head, the poet's soul is in the heart; the singer's soul lingers about his throat, but the soul of the dancer abides in all her body.”





The Two Guardian Angels


On an evening two angels met at the city gate, and they greeted one another, and they conversed.

The one angel said, “What are you doing these days, and what work is given you?”

And the other answered, “It was been assigned me to be the guardian of a fallen man who lives down in the valley, a great sinner, most degraded. Let me assure you it is an important task, and I work hard.”

The first fallen angel said, “That is an easy commission. I have often known sinners, and have been their guardian many a time. But it has now been assigned me to be the guardian of the good saint who lives in a bower out yonder. And I assure you that is an exceedingly difficult work, and most subtle.”

Said the first angel, “This is but assumption. How can guarding a saint be harder than guarding a sinner?”

And the other answered, “What impertinence, to call me assumptious！I have stated but the truth. Methinks it is you who are assumptious！”

Then the angels wrangled and fought, first with words and then with fists and wings.

While they were fighting an archangel came by. And he stopped them, and said, “Why do you fight? And what is it all about? Know you not that it is most unbecoming for guardian angels to fight at the city gate? Tell me, what is your disagreement?”

Then both angels spoke at once, each claiming that the work given him was the harder, and that he deserved the greater recognition.

The archangel shook his head and bethought him.

Then he said, “My friends, I cannot say now which one of you has the greater claim upon honor and reward. But since the power is bestowed in me, therefore for peace' sake and for good guardianship, I give each of you the other's occupation, since each of you insists that the other's task is the easier one. Now go hence and be happy at your work.”

The angels thus ordered went their ways. But each one looked backward with greater anger at the archangel. And in his heart each was saying, “Oh, these archangels！Every day they make life harder and still harder for us angels！”

But the archangel stood there, and once more he bethought him. And he said in his heart, “We have indeed, to be watchful and to keep guard over our guardian angels.”





The Statue


Once there lived a man among the hills who possessed a statue wrought by an ancient master. It lay at his door face downward and he was not mindful of it.

One day there passed by his house a man from the city, a man of knowledge, and seeing the statue he inquired of the owner if he would sell it.

The owner laughed and said, “And pray who would want to buy that dull and dirty stone?”

The man from the city said, “I will give you this piece of silver for it.”

And the other man was astonished and delighted.

The statue was removed to the city, upon the back of and elephant. And after many moons the man from the hills visited the city, and as he walked the streets he saw a crowd before a shop, and a man with a loud voice was crying, “Come ye in and behold the most beautiful, the most wonderful statue in all the world. Only two silver pices to look upon this most marvelous work of a master.”

Thereupon the man from the hills paid two silver pieces and entered the shop to see the statue that he himself had sold for one spice of silver.





The Exchange


Once upon a crossroad a poor Poet met a rich Stupid, and they conversed. And all that they said revealed but their discontent.

Then the Angel of the Road passed by, and he laid his hand upon the shoulder of the two men.

And behold, a miracle：The two men had now exchanged their possessions.

And they parted. But strange to relate, the Poet looked and found naught in his hand but dry moving sand; and the Stupid closed his eyes and felt naught but a moving cloud in his heart.





Love and Hate


A woman said unto a man, “I love you.” And the man said, “It is in my heart to be worthy of your love.”

Ant he woman said, “You love me not?”

And the man only gazed upon her and said nothing.

Then the woman cried aloud, “I hate you.”

And the man said, “Then it is also in my heart to be worthy of your hate.”





Dreams


A man dreamed a dream, and when he awoke he went to his soothsayer and desired that his dream be made plain unto him.

And the soothsayer said to the man, “Come to me with the dreams that you behold in your wakefulness and I will tell you their meaning. But the dreams of your sleep belong neither to my wisdom nor to your imagination.”





The Madman


It was in the garden of a madhouse that I met a youth with a face pale and lovely and full of wonder. And I sat beside him upon the bench, and I said, “Why are you here?”

And he looked at me in astonishment, and he said, “It is an unseemly question, yet I will answer you. My father would make of me a reproduction of himself; so also would my uncle. My mother would have me the image of her seafaring husband as the perfect example for me to follow. My brother thinks I should be like him, a fine athlete.

“And my teachers also, the doctor of philosophy, and the music-master, and the logician, they too were determined, and each would have me but a reflection of his own face in a mirror.

“Therefore I came to this place. I find it more sane here. At least, I can be myself.”

Then of a sudden he turned to me and he said, “But tell me, were you also driven to this place by education and good counsel?”

And I answered, “No, I am a visitor.”

And he answered, “Oh, you are one of those who live in the madhouse on the other side of the wall.”





The Frogs


Upon a summer day a frog said to his mate, “I fear those people living in that house on the shore are disturbed by our night-songs.”

And his mate answered and said, “Well, do they not annoy our silence during the day with their talking?”

The frog said, “Let us not forget that we may sing too much in the night.”

And his mate answered, “Let us not forget that they chatter and shout overmuch during the day.”

Said the frog, “How about the bullfrog who that they clatter and shout overmuch during the day.”

Said the frog, “How about the bullfrog who disturbs the whole neighborhood with his God-forbidden booming?”

And his mate replied, “Aye, and what say you of the politician and the priest and the scientist who come to these shores and fill the air with noisy and rhymeless sound?”

Then the frog said, “Well, let us be better than these human beings. Let us be quiet at night, and keep our songs in our hearts, even though the moon calls for our rhythm and the stars for our rhyme. At least, let us be silent for a night or two, or even for three nights.”

And his mate said, “Very well, I agree. We shall see what your bountiful heart will bring forth.”

That night the frogs were silent; and they were silent the following night also, and again upon the third night.

And strange to relate, the talkative woman who lived in the house beside the lake came down to breakfast on that third day and shouted to her husband, “I have not slept these three nights. I was secure with sleep when the noise of the frogs was in my ear. But something must have happened. They have not sung now for three nights; and I am almost maddened with sleeplessness.”

The frog heard this and turned to his mate and said, winking his eye, “And we were almost maddened with our silence, were we not?”

And his mate answered, “Yes, the silence of the night was heavy upon us. And I can see now that there is no need for us to cease our singing for the comfort of those who must needs fill their emptiness with noise.”

And that night the moon called not in vain for their rhythm nor the stars for their rhyme.





Laws and Law-Giving


Ages ago there was a great king, and he was wise. And he desired to lay laws unto his subjects.

He called upon one thousand wise men of one thousand different tribes to his capital and lay down the laws.

And all this came to pass.

But when the thousand laws written upon parchment were put before the king and he read them, he wept bitterly in his soul, for he had not known that there were one thousand forms of crime in his kingdom.

Then he called his scribe, and with a smile upon his mouth he himself dictated laws. And his laws were but seven.

And the one thousand wise men left him in anger and returned to their tribes with the laws they had laid down. And every tribe followed the laws of its wise men.

Therefore they have a thousand laws even to our own day.

It is a great country, but it has one thousand prisons, and the prisons are full of women and men, breakers of a thousand laws.

It is indeed a great country, but the people thereof are decendants of one thousand law-givers and of only one wise king.





Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow


I said to my friend, “You see her leaning upon the arm of that man. It was but yesterday that she leaned thus upon my arm.”

And my friend said, “And tomorrow she will lean upon mine.”

I said, “Behold her sitting close at his side. It was but yesterday she sat close beside me.”

And he answered, “Tomorrow she will sit beside me.”

I said, “See, she drinks wine from his cup, and yesterday she drank from mine.”

And he said, “Tomorrow, from my cup.”

Then I said, “See how she gazes at him with love, and with yielding eyes. Yesterday she gazed thus upon me.”

And my friend said, “It will be upon me she gazes tomorrow.”

I said, “Do you not hear her now murmuring songs of love into his ears? Those very songs of love she murmured but yesterday into my ears.”

And my friend said, “And tomorrow she will murmur them in mine.”

I said, “Why see, she is embracing him. It was but yesterday that she embraced me.”

And my friend said, “She will embrace me tomorrow.”

Then I said, “What a strange woman.”

But he answered, “She is like unto life, possessed by all men; and like death, she conquers all men; and like eternity, she enfolds all men.”





The Philosopher and the Cobbler


There came to a cobbler's shop a philosopher with worn shoes. And the philosopher said to the cobbler, “Please mend my shoes.”

And the cobbler said, “I am mending another man's shoes now, and there are still other shoes to patch before I can come to yours. But leave your shoes here, and wear this other pair today, and come tomorrow for your own.”

Then the philosopher was indignant, and he said, “I wear no shoes that are not mine own.”

And the cobbler said, “Well then, are you in truth a philosopher, and cannot enfold your feet with the shoes of another man? Upon this very street there is another cobbler who understands philosophers better than I do. Go you to him for mending.”





Builders of Bridges


In Antioch where the river Assi goes to meet the sea, a bridge was built to bring one half of the city nearer to the other half. It was built of large stones carried down from among the hills, on the backs of the mules of Antioch.

When the bridge was finished, upon a pilar thereof was engraved in Greek and in Aramaic, “This bridge was builded by King Antiochus II.”

And all the people walked across the good bridge over the goodly river Assi.

And upon an evening, a youth, deemed by some a little mad, descended to the pillar where the words were engraven, and he covered over the graving with charcoal, and above it wrote, “The stones of this bridge were brought down from the hills by the mules. In passing to and fro over it you are riding upon the backs of the mules of Antioch, builders of this bridge.”

And when the people read what the youth had written, some of them laughed and some marveled. And some said, “Ah yes, we know who has done this. Is he not a little mad?”

But one mule said, laughing, to another mule, “Do you not remember that we did carry those stones? And yet until now it has been said that the bridge was builded by King Antiochus.”





The Field of Zaad


Upon the road of Zaad a traveler met a man who lived in a nearby village, and the traveler, pointing with his hand to a vast field, asked the man saying, “Was not this the battle-ground where King Ahlam overcame his enemies?”

And the man answered and said, “This has never been a battleground. There once stood on this field the great city of Zaad, and it was burnt down to ashes. But now it is a good field, is it not?”

And the traveler and the man parted.

Not a half mile farther the traveler met another man, and pointing to the field again, he said, “So that is where the great city of Zaad once stood?”

And the man said, “There has never been a city in this place. But once there was a monastery here, and it was destroyed by the people of the South Country.”

Shortly after, on that very road of Zaad, the traveler met a third man, and pointing once more to the vast field he said, “Is it not true that this is the place where once there stood a great monastery?”

But the man answered, “There has never been a monastery in this neighborhood, but our fathers and our forefathers have told us that once there fell a great meteor on this field.”

Then the traveler walked on, wondering in his heart. And he met a very old man, and saluting his he said, “Sir, upon this road I have met three men who live in the neighborhood and I have asked each of them about this field, and each one denied what the other had said, and each one told me a new tale that the other had not told.”

Then the old man raised his head, and answered, “My friend, each and every one of these men told you what was indeed so; but few of us are able to add fact to different fact and make a truth thereof.”





The Golden Belt


Once upon a day two men who met on the road were walking together toward Salamis, the City of Columns. In the mid-afternoon they came to a wide river and there was no bridge to cross it. They must needs swim, or seek another road unknown to them.

And they said to one another, “Let us swim. After all, the river is not so wide.” And they threw themselves into the water and swam.

And one of the men who had always known rivers and the ways of rivers, in mid-stream suddenly began to lose himself; and to be carried away by the rushing waters; while the other who had never swum before crossed the river straight-way and stood upon the farther bank. Then seeing his companion stil wrestling with the stream, he threw himself again into the waters and brought him also safely to the shore.

And the man who had been swept away by the current said, “But you told me you could not swim. How then did you cross that river with such assurance?”

And the second man answered, “My friend, do you see this belt which girdles me? It is full of golden coins that I have earned for my wife and my children, a full year's work. It is the weight of this belt of gold tha carried me across the river, to my wife and my children. And my wife and my children were upon my shoulders as I swam.”

And the two men walked on together toward Salamis.





The Red Earth


Said a tree to a man, “My roots are in the deep red earth, and I shall give you of my fruit.”

And the man said to the tree, “How alike we are. My roots are also deep in the red earth. And the red earth gives you power to bestow upon me of your fruit, and the red earth teaches me to receive from you with thanksgiving.”





The Full Moon


The full moon rose in glory upon the town, and all the dogs of that town began to bark at the moon.

Only one dog did not bark, and he said to them in a grave voice, “Awake not stillness from her sleep, nor bring you the moon to the earth with your barking.”

Then all the dogs ceased barking, in awful silence. But the dog who had spoken to them continued barking for silence, the rest of the night.





The Hermit Prophet


Once there lived a hermit prophet, and thrice a moon he would go down to the great city and in the market places he would preach giving and sharing to the people. And he was eloquent, and his fame was upon the land.

Upon an evening three men came to his hermitage and he greeted them. And they said, “You have been preaching giving and sharing, and you have sought to teach those who have much to give unto those who have little; and we doubt not that your fame has brought you riches. Now come and give us of your riches, for we are in need.”

And the hermit answered and said, “My friends, I have naught but this bed and this mat and this jug of water. Take them if it is in your desire. I have neither gold nor silver.”

Then they looked down with distain upon him, and turned their faces from him, and the last man stood at the door for a moment, and said, “Oh, you cheat！You fraud！You teach and preach that which you yourself do not perform.”





The Old, Old Wine


Once there lived a rich man who was justly proud of his cellar and the wine therein. And there was one jug of ancient vintage kept for some occasion known only to himself.

The governor of the state visited him, and he bethought him and said, “That jug shall not be opened for a mere governor.”

And a bishop of the diocese visited him, but he said to himself, “Nay, I will not open that jug. He would not know its value, nor would its aroma reach his nostrils.”

The prince of the realm came and supped with him. But he thought, “It is too royal a wine for a mere princeling.”

And even on the day when his own nephew was married, he said to himself, “No, not to these guests shall that jug be brought forth.”

And the years passed by, and he died, an old man, and he was buried like unto every seed and acorn.

And upon the day that he was buried the ancient jug was brought out together with other jugs of wine, and it was shared by the peasants of the neighborhood. And none knew its great age.

To them, all that is poured into a cup is only wine.





The Two Poems


Many centuries ago, on a road to Athens, two poets met, and they were glad to see one another.

And one poet asked the other saying, “What have you composed of late, and how goes it with your lyre?”

And the other poet answered and said with pride, “I have but now finished the greatest of my poems, perchance the greatest poem yet written in Greek. It is an invocation to Zeus the Supreme.”

Then he took from beneath his cloak a parchment, saying, “Here, behold, I have it with me, and I would fain read it to you. Come, let us sit in the shade of that white cypress.”

And the poet read his poem. And it was a long poem.

And the other poet said in kindliness, “This is a great poem. It will live through the ages, and in it you shall be glorified.”

And the first poet said calmly, “And what have you been writing these late days?”

And the other another, “I have written but little. Only eight lines in remembrance of a child playing in a garden.” And he recited the lines.

The first poet said, “Not so bad; not so bad.”

And they parted.

And now after two thousand years the eight lines of the one poet are read in every tongue, and are loved and cherished.

And though the other poem has indeed come down through the ages in libraries and in the cells of scholars, and though it is remembered, it is neither loved nor read.





Lady Ruth


Three men once looked from afar upon a white house that stood alone on a green hill. One of them said, “That is the house of Lady Ruth. She is an old witch.”

The second man said, “You are wrong. Lady Ruth is a beautiful woman who lives there consecrated unto her dreams.”

The third man said, “You are both wrong. Lady Ruth is the holder of this vast land, and she draws blood from her serfs.”

And they walked on discussing Lady Ruth. Then when they came to a crossroad they met an old man, and one of them asked him, saying, “Would you please tell us about the Lady Ruth who lives in that white house upon the hill?”

And the old man raised his head and smiled upon them, and said, “I am ninety of years, and I remember Lady Ruth when I was but a boy. But Lady Ruth died eighty years ago, and now the house is empty. The owls hoot therein, sometimes, and people say the place is haunted.”





The Mouse and the Cat


Once on an evening a poet met a peasant. The poet was distant and the peasant was shy, yet they conversed.

And the peasant said, “Let me tell you a little story which I heard of late. A mouse was caught in a trap, and while he was happily eating the cheese that lay therein, a cat stood by. The mouse trembled awhile, but he knew he was safe within the trap.

“Then the cat said, ‘You are eating your last meal, my friend.’

“‘Yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘one life have I, therefore one death. But what of you? They tell me you have nine lives. Doesn't that mean that you will have to die nine times?’”

And the peasant looked at the poet and he said, “Is not this a strange story?”

And the poet answered him not, but he walked away saying in his soul, “To be sure, nine lives have we, nine lives to be sure. And we shall die nine times, nine times shall we die. Perhaps it were better to have but one life, caught in a trap—the life of a peasant with a bit of cheese for the last meal. And yet, are we not kin unto the lions of the desert and the jungle?”





The Curse


And old man of the sea once said to me, “It was thirty years ago that a sailor ran away with my daughter. And I cursed them both in my heart, for of all the world I loved but my daughter.

“Not long after that, the sailor youth went down with his ship to the bottom of the sea, and with him my lovely daughter was lost unto me.

“Now therefore behold in me the murderer of a youth and a maid. It was my curse that destroyed them. And now on my way to the grave I seek God's forgiveness.”

This the old man said. But there was a tone of bragging in his words, and it seems that he is still proud of the power of his curse.





The Pomegranates


There was once a man who had many pomegranate trees in his orchard. And for many an autumn he would put his pomegranates on silvery trays outside of his dwelling, and upon the trays he would place signs upon which he himself had written, “Take one for aught. You are welcome.”

But people passed by and no one took of the fruit.

Then the man bethought him, and one autumn he placed no pomegranates on silvery trays outside of his dwelling, but he raised this sign in large lettering： “Here we have th best pomegranates in the land, but we sell them for more silver than any other pomegranates.”

And now behold, all the men and women of the neighborhood came rushing to buy.





God and Many Gods


In the city of Kilafis a sophist stood on the steps of the Temple and preached many gods. And the people said in their hearts, “We know all this. Do they not live with us and follow us wherever we go?”

Not long after, another man stood in the market place and spoke unto the people and said, “There is no god.” And many who heard him were glad of his tidings, for they were afraid of gods.

And upon another day there came a man of great eloquence, an he said, “There is but one God.” And now the people were dismayed for in their hearts they feared the judgment of one God more than that of many gods.

That same season there came yet another man, and he said to the people, “There are three gods, and they dwell upon the wind as one, and they have a vast and gracious mother who is also their mate and their sister.”

Then everyone was comforted, for they said in their secret, “three gods in one must needs disagree over our failings, and besides, their gracious mother will surely be an advocate for us poor weaklings.”

Yet even to this day there are those in the city of Kilafis who wrangle and argue with each other about many gods and no god, and one god and three gods in one, and a gracious mother of gods.





She Who Was Deaf


Once there lived a rich man who had a young wife, and she was stone deaf.

And upon a morning when they were breaking their feast, she spoke to him and she said, “Yesterday I visited the market place, and there were exibited silken raiment from Damascus, and coverchiefs from India, necklaces from Persia, and bracelets from Yamman. It seems that the caravans had but just brought these things to our city. And now behold me, in rags, yet the wife of a rich man. I would have some of those beautiful things.”

The husband, still busy with his morning coffee said, “My dear, there is no reason why you should not go down to the Street and buy all that your heart may desire.”

And the deaf wife said, “‘No！’ You always say, ‘No, no.’ Must I needs appear in tatters among our friends to shame your wealth and my people?”

And the husband said, “I did not say, ‘No.’ You may go forth freely to the market place and purchase the most beautiful apparel and jewels that have come to our city.”

But again the wife mis-read his words, and she replied, “Of all rich men you are the most miserly. You would deny me everything of beauty and loveliness, while other women of my age walk the gardens of the city clothed in rich raiment.”

And she began to weep. And as her tears fell upon her breast she cried out again, “You always say, ‘Nay, nay’ to me when I desire a garment or a jewel.”

Then the husband was moved, and he stood up and took out of his purse a handful of gold and placed it before her, saying in a kindly voice, “Go down to the market place, my dear, and buy all that you will.”

From that day onward the deaf young wife, whenever she desired anything, would appear before her husband with a pearly tear in her eye, and he in silence would take out a handful of gold and place it in her lap.

Now, it changed that the young woman fell in love with a youth whose habit it was to make long journeys. And whenever he was away she would sit in her casement and weep.

When her husband found her thus weeping, he would say in his heart, “There must be some new caraven, and some silken garments and rare jewels in the Street.”

And he would take a handful of gold and place it before her.





The Quest


A thousand years ago two philosophers met on a slope of Lebanon, and one said to the other, “Where goest thou?”

And the other answered, “I am seeking after the fountain of youth which I know wells out among these hills. I have found writings which tell of that fountain flowering toward the sun. And you, what are you seeking?”

The first man answered, “I am seeking after the mystery of death.”

Then each of the two philosophers conceived that the other was lacking in his great science, and they began to wrangle, and to accuse each other of spiritual blindness.

Now while the two philosophers were loud upon the wind, a stranger, a man who was deemed a simpleton in his own village, passed by, and when he heard the two in hot dispute, he stood awhile and listened to their arguement.

Then he came near to them and said, “My good men, it seems that you both really belong to the same school of philosophy, and that you are speaking of the same thing, only you speak in different words. One of you is seeks the fountain of youth, and the other seeks the mystery of death. Yet indeed they are but one, and as they dwell in you both.”

Then the stranger turned away saying, “Farewell sages.” And as he departed he laughed a patient laughter.

The two philosophers looked at each other in silence for a moment, and then they laughed also. And one of them said, “Well now, shall we not walk and seek together.”





The Sceptre


Said a king to his wife, “Madame, you are not truly a queen. You are too vulgar and ungracious to be my mate.”

Said his wife, “Sir, you deem yourself king, but indeed you are only a poor soundling.”

Now these words angered the king, and he took his septre with his hand, and struck the queen upon her forehead with his golden sceptre.

At that moment the lord chamberlain entered, and he said, “Well, well, Majesty！That sceptre was fashioned by the greatest artist of the land. Alas！Some day you and the queen shall be forgotten, but this sceptre shall be kept, a thing of beauty from generation to generation. And now that you have drawn blood from her Majesty's head, Sire, the sceptre shall be the more considered and remembered.”





The Path


There lived among the hills a woman and her son, and he was her first-born and her only child.

And the boy died of a fever whilst the physician stood by.

The mother was distraught with sorrow, and she cried to the physician and besought him saying, “Tell me, tell me, what was it that made quiet his striving and silent his song?”

And the physician said, “It was the fever.”

And the mother said, “What is the fever?”

And the physician answered, “I cannot explain it. It is a thing infinately small that visits the body, and we cannot see it with the human eye.”

The physician left her. And she kept repeating to herself, “Something infinately small. We cannot see it with our human eye.”

And at evening the priest came to console her. And she wept and she cried out saying, “Oh, why have I lost my son, my only son, my firstborn?”

And the priest answered, “My child, it is the will of God.”

And the woman said, “What is God and where is God? I would see God that I may tear my bosom before Him, and pour the blood of my heart at His feet. Tell me where I shall find Him.” And the priest said, “God is infinately vast. He is not to be seen with our human eye.”

Then the woman cried out, “The infinately small has slain my son through the will of the infinately great！Then what are we? What are we?”

At that moment the woman's mother came into the room with the shroud for the dead boy, and she heard the words of the priest and also her daughter's cry. And she laid down the shroud, and took her daughter's hand in her own hand, and she said, “My daughter, we ourselves are the infinately small and the infinately great; and we are the path between the two.”





The Whale and the Butterfly


Once on an evening a man and a woman found themselves together in a stagecoach. They had met before.

The man was a poet, and as he sat beside the woman he sought to amuse her with stories, some that were of his own weaving, and some that were not his own.

But even while he was speaking the lady went to sleep. Then suddenly the coach lurched, and she awoke, and she said, “I admire your interpretation of the story of Jonah and the whale.”

And the poet said, “But Madame, I have been telling you a story of mine own about a butterfly and a white rose, and how they behaved the one to the other！”





Peace Contagious


One branch in bloom said to his neighboring branch, “This is a dull and empty day.” And the other brance answered, “It is indeed empty and dull.”

At that moment a sparrow alighted on one of the branches, and the another sparrow, nearby.

And one of the sparrows chirped and said, “My mate has left me.”

And the other sparrow cried, “My mate has also gone, and she will not return. And what care I?”

Then the two birds began to twitter and scold, and soon they were fighting and making harsh noise upon the air.

All of a sudden two other sparrows came sailing from the sky, and they sat quietly beside the restless two. And there was calm, and there was peace.

Then the four flew away together in pairs.

And the first branch said to his neighboring branch, “That was a mighty zig-zag of sound.”

And the other branch answered, “Call it what you will, it is now both peaceful and spacious. And if the upper air makes peace it seems to me that those who dwell in the lower might make peace also. Will you not wave in the wind a little nearer to me?”

And the first branch said, “Oh, perchance, for peace' sake, ere the Spring is over.”

And then he waved himself with the strong wind to embrace her.





The Shadow


Upon a June day the grass said to the shadow of an elm tree, “You move to right and left over-often, and you disturb my peace.”

And the shadow answered and said, “Not I, not I. Look skyward. There is a tree that moves in the wind to the east and to the west, between the sun and the earth.”

And the grass looked up, and for the first time beheld the tree. And it said in its heart, “Why, behold, there is a larger grass than myself.”

And the grass was silent.





Seventy


The poet youth said to the princess, “I love you.” And the princess answered, “And I love you too, my child.”

“But I am not your child. I am a man and I love you.”

And she said, “I am the mother of sons and daughters, and they are fathers and mothers of sons and daughters; and one of the sons of my sons is older than you.”

And the poet youth said, “But I love you.”

It was not long after that the princess died. But ere her last breath was received again by the greater breath of earth, she said within her soul, “My beloved, mine only son, my youth-poet, it may yet be that some day we shall meet again, and I shall not be seventy.”





Finding God


Two men were walking in the valley, and one man pointed with his finger toward the mountain side, and said, “See you that hermitage? There lives a man who has long divorced the world. He seeks but after God, and naught else upon this earth.”

And the other man said, “He shall not find God until he leaves his hermitage, and the aloneness of his hermitage, and returns to our world, to share our joy and pain, to dance with our dancers at the wedding feast, and to weep with those who weep around the coffins of our dead.”

And the other man was convinced in his heart, though in spite of his conviction he answered, “I agree with all that you say, yet I believe the hermit is a good man. And it may it not well be that one good man by his absence does better than the seeming goodness of these many men?”





The River


In the valley of Kadisha where the mighty river flows, two little streams met and spoke to one another.

One stream said, “How came you, my friend, and how was your path?”

And the other answered, “My path was most encumbered. The wheel of the mill was broken, and the master farmer who used to conduct me from my channel to his plants, is dead. I struggled down oozing with the filth of laziness in the sun. But how was your path, my brother?”

And the other stream answered and said, “Mine was a different path. I came down the hills among fragrant flowers and shy willows; men and women drank of me with silvery cups, and little children paddled their rosy feet at my edges, and there was laughter all about me, and there were sweet songs. What a pity that your path was not so happy.”

At that moment the river spoke with a loud voice and said, “Come in, come in, we are going to the sea. Come in, come in, speak no more. Be with me now. We are going to the sea. Come in, come in, for in me you shall forget you wanderings, sad or gay. Come in, come in. And you and I will forget all our ways when we reach the heart of our mother the sea.”





The Two Hunters


Upon a day in May, Joy and Sorrow met beside a lake. They greeted one another, and they sat down near the quiet waters and conversed.

Joy spoke of the beauty which is upon the earth, and the daily wonder of life in the forest and among the hills, and of the songs heard at dawn and eventide.

And sorrow spoke, and agreed with all that Joy had said; for Sorrow knew the magic of the hour and the beauty thereof. And Sorrow was eloquent when he spoke of may in the fields and among the hills.

And Joy and Sorrow talked long together, and they agreed upon all things of which they knew.

Now there passed by on the other side of the lake two hunters. And as they looked across the water one of them said, “I wonder who are those two persons?” And the other said, “Did you say two? I see only one.”

The first hunter said, “But there are two.” And the second said, “There is only one that I can see, and the reflection in the lake is only one.”

“Nay, there are two,” said the first hunter, “and the reflection in the still water is of two persons.”

But the second man said again, “Only one do I see.” And again the other said, “But I see two so plainly.”

And even unto this day one hunter says that the other sees double; while the other says, “My friend is somewhat blind.”





The Other Wanderer


Once on a time I met another man of the roads. He too was a little mad, and thus spoke to me：

“I am a wanderer. Oftentimes it seems that I walk the earth among pygmies. And because my head is seventy cubits farther from the earth than theirs, it creates higher and freer thoughts.

“But in truth I walk not among men but above them, and all they can see of me is my footprints in their open fields.

“And often have I heard them discuss and disagree over the shape and size of my footprints. For there are some who say, ‘These are the tracks of a mammoth that roamed the earth in the far past.’ And others say, ‘Nay, these are places where meteors have fallen from the distant stars.’

“But you, my friend, you know full well that they are naught save the footprints of a wanderer.”





The Broken Wings





Foreword


I was eighteen years of age when love opened my eyes with its magic rays and touched my spirit for the first time with its fiery fingers, and Selma Karamy was the first woman who awakened my spirit with her beauty and led me into the garden of high affection, where days pass like dreams and nights like weddings.

Selma Karamy was the one who taught me to worship beauty by the example of her own beauty and revealed to me the secret of love by her affection; she was the one who first sang to me the poetry of real life.

A very young man remembers his first love and tries to recapture that strange hour, the memory of which changes his deepest feeling and makes him so happy in spite of all the bitterness of its mystery.

In every young man's life there is a “Selma” who appears to him suddenly while in the spring of life and transforms his solitude into happy moments and fills the silence of his nights with music.

I was deeply engrossed in thought and contemplation and seeking to understand the meaning of nature and the revelation of books and scriptures when I heard LOVE whispered into my ears through Selma's lips. My life was a coma, empty like that of Adam's in Paradise, when I saw Selma standing before me like a column of light. She was the Eve of my heart who filled it with secrets and wonders and made me understand the meaning of life.

The first Eve led Adam out of Paradise by her own will, while Selma made me enter willingly into the paradise of pure love and virtue by her sweetness and love; but what happened to the first man also happened to me, and the fiery word which chased Adam out of Paradise was like the one which frightened me by its glittering edge and forced me away from paradise of my love without having disobeyed any order or tasted the fruit of the forbidden tree.

Today, after many years have passed, I have nothing left out of that beautiful dream except painful memories flapping like invisible wings around me, filling the depths of my heart with sorrow, and bringing tears to my eyes; and my beloved, beautiful Selma, is dead and nothing is left to commemorate her except my broken heart and tomb surrounded by cypress trees. That tomb and this heart are all that is left to bear witness of Selma.

The silence that guards the tomb does not reveal God's secret in the obscurity of the coffin, and the rustling of the branches whose roots suck the body's elements do not tell the mysteries of the grave, by the agonized sighs of my heart announce to the living the drama which love, beauty, and death have performed.

Oh, friends of my youth who are scattered in the city of Beirut, when you pass by the cemetery near the pine forest, enter it silently and walk slowly so the tramping of your feet will not disturb the slumber of the dead, and stop humbly by Selma's tomb and greet the earth that encloses her corpse and mention my name with deep sigh and say to yourself, “here, all the hopes of Gibran, who is living as prisoner of love beyond the seas, were buried. On this spot he lost his happiness, drained his tears, and forgot his smile.”

Ay that tomb grows Gibran's sorrow together with the cypress trees, and above the tomb his spirit flickers every night commemorating Selma, joining the branches of the trees in sorrowful wailing, mourning and lamenting the going of Selma, who, yesterday was a beautiful tune on the lips of life and today is a silent secret in the bosom of the earth.

Oh, comrades of my youth！I appeal to you in the names of those virgins whom your hearts have loved, to lay a wreath of flowers on the forsaken tomb of my beloved, for the flowers you lay on Selma's tomb are like falling drops of dew for the eyes of dawn on the leaves of withering rose.





Silent Sorrow


My neighbors, you remember the dawn of youth with pleasure and regret its passing; but I remember it like a prisoner who recalls the bars and shackles of his jail. You speak of those years between infancy and youth as a golden era free from confinement and cares, but I call those years an era of silent sorrow which dropped as a seed into my heart and grew with it and could find no outlet to the world of Knowledge and wisdom until love came and opened the heart's doors and lighted its corners. Love provided me with a tongue and tears. You people remember the gardens and orchids and the meeting places and street corners that witnessed your games and heard your innocent whispering; and I remember, too, the beautiful spot in North Lebanon. Every time I close my eyes I see those valleys full of magic and dignity and those mountains covered with glory and greatness trying to reach the sky. Every time I shut my ears to the clamor of the city I hear the murmur of the rivulets and the rustling of the branches. All those beauties which I speak of now and which I long to see, as a child longs for his mother's breast, wounded my spirit, imprisoned in the darkness of youth, as a falcon suffers in its cage when it sees a flock of birds flying freely in the spacious sky. Those valleys and hills fired my imagination, but bitter thoughts wove round my heart a net of hopelessness.

Every time I went to the fields I returned disappointed, without understanding the cause of my disappointment. Every time I looked at the gray sky I felt my heart contract. Every time I heard the singing of the birds and babbling of the spring I suffered without understanding the reason for my suffering. It is said that unsophistication makes a man empty and that emptiness makes him carefree. It may be true among those who were born dead and who exist like frozen corpses; but the sensitive boy who feels much and knows little is the most unfortunate creature under the sun, because he is torn by two forces. The first force elevates him and shows him the beauty of existence through a cloud of dreams; the second ties him down to the earth and fills his eyes with dust and overpowers him with fears and darkness.

Solitude has soft, silky hands, but with strong fingers it grasps the heart and makes it ache with sorrow. Solitude is the ally of sorrow as well as a companion of spiritual exaltation.

The boy's soul undergoing the buffeting of sorrow is like a white lily just unfolding. It trembles before the breeze and opens its heart to daybreak and folds its leaves back when the shadow of night comes. If that boy does not have diversion or friends or companions in his games his life will be like a narrow prison in which he sees nothing but spiderwebs and hears nothing but the crawling of insects.

That sorrow which obsessed me during my youth was not caused by lack of amusement, because I could have had it; neither from lack of friends, because I could have found them. That sorrow was caused by an inward ailment which made me love solitude. It killed in me the inclination for games and amusement. It removed from my shoulders the wings of youth and made me like a pong of water between mountains which reflects in its calm surface the shadows of ghosts and the colors of clouds and trees, but cannot find an outlet by which to pass singing to the sea.

Thus was my life before I attained the age of eighteen. That year is like a mountain peak in my life, for it awakened knowledge in me and made me understand the vicissitudes of mankind. In that year I was reborn and unless a person is born again his life will remain like a blank sheet in the book of existence. In that year, I saw the angels of heaven looking at me through the eyes of a beautiful woman. I also saw the devils of hell raging in the heart of an evil man. He who does not see the angels and devils in the beauty and malice of life will be far removed from knowledge, and his spirit will be empty of affection.





The Hand of Destiny


In the spring of the that wonderful year, I was in Beirut. The gardens were full of Nisan flowers and the earth was carpeted with green grass, and like a secret of earth revealed to Heaven. The orange trees and apple trees, looking like houris or brides sent by nature to inspire poets and excite the imagination, were wearing white garments of perfumed blossoms.

Spring is beautiful everywhere, but it is most beautiful in Lebanon. It is a spirit that roams round the earth but hovers over Lebanon, conversing with kings and prophets, singing with the rives the songs of Solomon, and repeating with the Holy Cedars of Lebanon the memory of ancient glory. Beirut, free from the mud of winter and the dust of summer, is like a bride in the spring, or like a mermaid sitting by the side of a brook drying her smooth skin in the rays of the sun.

One day, in the month of Nisan, I went to visit a friend whose home was at some distance from the glamorous city. As we were conversing, a dignified man of about sixty-five entered the house. As I rose to greet him, my friend introduced him to me as Farris Effandi Karamy and then gave him my name with flattering words. The old man looked at me a moment, touching his forehead with the ends of his fingers as if he were trying to regain his memory. Then he smilingly approached me saying, “You are the son of a very dear friend of mine, and I am happy to see that friend in your person.”

Much affected by his words, I was attracted to him like a bird whose instinct leads him to his nest before the coming of the tempest. As we sat down, he told us about his friendship with my father, recalling the time which they spent together. An old man likes to return in memory to the days of his youth like a stranger who longs to go back to his own country. He delights to tell stories of the past like a poet who takes pleasure in reciting his best poem. He lives spiritually in the past because the present passes swiftly, and the future seems to him an approach to the oblivion of the grave. An hour full of old memories passed like the shadows of the trees over the grass. When Farris Effandi started to leave, he put his left hand on my shoulder and shook my right hand, saying, “I have not seen your father for twenty years. I hope you will l take his place in frequent visits to my house.” I promised gratefully to do my duty toward a dear friend of my father.

When the old man left the house, I asked my friend to tell me more about him. He said, “I do not know any other man in Beirut whose wealth has made him kind and whose kindness has made him wealthy. He is one of the few who come to this world and leave it without harming any one, but people of that kind are usually miserable and oppressed because they are not clever enough to save themselves from the crookedness of others. Farris Effandi has one daughter whose character is similar to his and whose beauty and gracefulness are beyond description, and she will also be miserable because her father's wealth is placing her already at the edge of a horrible precipice.”

As he uttered these words, I noticed that his face clouded. Then he continued, “Farris Effandi is a good old man with a noble heart, but he lacks will power. People lead him like a blind man. His daughter obeys him in spite of her pride and intelligence, and this is the secret which lurks in the life of father and daughter. This secret was discovered by an evil man who is a bishop and whose wickedness hides in the shadow of his Gospel. He makes the people believe that he is kind and noble. He is the head of religion in this land of the religions. The people obey and worship him. He leads them like a flock of lambs to the slaughter house. This bishop has a nephew who is full of hatefulness and corruption. The day will come sooner or later when he will place his nephew on his right and Farris Effandi's daughter on this left, and, holding with his evil hand the wreath of matrimony over their heads, will tie a pure virgin to a filthy degenerate, placing the heart of the day in the bosom of the night.

“That is all I can tell you about Farris Effandi and his daughter, so do not ask me any more questions.”

Saying this, he turned his head toward the window as if he were trying to solve the problems of human existence by concentrating on the beauty of the universe.

As I left the house I told my friend that I was going to visit Farris Effandi in a few days for the purpose of fulfilling my promise and for the sake of the friendship which had joined him and my father. He stared at me for a moment, and I noticed a change in his expression as if my few simple words had revealed to him a new idea. Then he looked straight through my eyes in a strange manner, a look of love, mercy, and fear—the look of a prophet who foresees what no one else can divine. Then his lips trembled a little, but he said nothing when I started towards the door. That strange look followed me, the meaning of which I could not understand until I grew up in the world of experience, where hearts understand each other intuitively and where spirits are mature with knowledge.





Entrance to the Shrine


In a few days, loneliness overcame me; and I tired of the grim faces of books; I hired a carriage and started for the house of Farris Effandi. As I reached the pine woods where people went for picnics, the driver took a private way, shaded with willow trees on each side. Passing through, we could see the beauty of the green grass, the grapevines, and the many colored flowers of Nisan just blossoming.

In a few minutes the carriage stopped before a solitary house in the midst of a beautiful garden. The scent of roses, gardenia, and jasmine filled the air. As I dismounted and entered the spacious garden, I saw Farris Effandi coming to meet me. He ushered me into his house with a hearty welcome and sat by me, like a happy father when he sees his son, showering me with questions on my life, future and education. I answered him, my voice full of ambition and zeal; for I heard ringing in my ears the hymn of glory, and I was sailing the calm sea of hopeful dreams. Just then a beautiful young woman, dressed in a gorgeous white silk gown, appeared from behind the velvet curtains of the door and walked toward me. Farris Effandi and I rose from our seats.

“This is my daughter Selma,” said the old man. Then he introduced me to her, saying, “Fate has brought back to me a dear old friend of mine in the person of his son.” Selma stared at me a moment as if doubting that a visitor could have entered their house. Her hand, when I touched it, was like a white lily, and a strange pang pierced my heart.

We all sat silent as if Selma had brought into the room with her heavenly spirit worthy of mute respect. As she felt the silence she smiled at me and said, “Many a times my father has repeated to me the stories of his youth and of the old days he and your father spent together. If your father spoke to you in the same way, then this meeting is not the first one between us.”

The old man was delighted to hear his daughter talking in such a manner and said, “Selma is very sentimental. She sees everything through the eyes of the spirit.” Then he resumed his converstion with care and tact as if he had found in me a magic which took him on the wings of memory to the days of the past.

As I considered him, dreaming of my own later years, he looked upon me, as a lofty old tree that has withstood storms and sunshine throws its shadow upon a small sapling which shakes before the breeze of dawn.

But Selma was silent. Occasionally, she looked first at me and then at her father as if reading the first and last chapters of life's drama. The day passed faster in that garden, and I could see through the window the ghostly yellow kiss of sunset on the mountains of Lebanon. Farris Effandi continued to recount his experiences and I listened entranced and responded with such enthusiasm that his sorrow was changed to happiness.

Selma sat by the window, looking on with sorrowful eyes and not speaking, although beauty has its own heavenly language, loftier than the voices of tongues and lips. It is a timeless language, common to all humanity, a calm lake that attracts the singing rivulets to its depth and makes them silent.

Only our spirits can understand beauty, or live and grow with it. It puzzles our minds; we are unable to describe it in words; it is a sensation that our eyes cannot see, derived from both the one who observes and the one who is looked upon. Real beauty is a ray which emanates from the holy of holies of the spirit, and illuminates the body, as life comes from the depths of the earth and gives color and scent to a flower.

Real beauty lies in the spiritual accord that is called love which can exist between a man and a woman.

Did my spirit and Selma's reach out to each other that day when we met, and did that yearning make me see her as the most beautiful woman under the sun? Or was I intoxicated with the wine of youth which made me fancy that which never existed?

Did my youth blind my natural eyes and make me imagine the brightness of her eyes, the sweetness of her mouth, and the grace of her figure? Or was it that her brightness, sweetness, and grace opened my eyes and showed me the happiness and sorrow of love?

It is hard to answer these questions, but I say truly that in that hour I felt an emotion that I had never felt before, a new affection resting calmly in my heart, like the spirit hovering over the waters at the creation of the world, and from that affection was born my happiness and my sorrow. Thus ended the hour of my first meeting with Selma, and thus the will of Heaven freed me from the bondage of youth and solitude and let me walk in the procession of love.

Love is the only freedom in the world because it so elevates the spirit that the laws of humanity and the phenomena of nature do not alter its course.

As I rose from my seat to depart, Farris Effandi came close to me and said soberly, “Now my son, since you know your way to this house, you should come often and feel that you are coming to your father's house. Consider me as a father and Selma as a sister.” Saying this, he turned to Selma as if to ask confirmation of his statement. She nodded her head positively and then looked at me as one who has found an old acquaintance.

Those words uttered by Farris Effandi Karamy placed me side by side with his daughter at the altar of love. Those words were a heavenly song which started with exaltation and ended with sorrow; they raised our spirits to the realm of light and searing flame; they were the cup from which we drank happiness and bitterness.

I left the house. The old man accompanied me to the edge of the garden, while my heart throbbed like the trembling lips of a thirsty man.





The White Torch


The month of Nisan had nearly passed. I continued to visit the home of Farris Effendi and to meet Selma in that beautiful garden, gazing upon her beauty, marveling at her intelligence, and hearing the stillness of sorrow. I felt an invisible hand drawing me to her.

Every visit gave me a new meaning to her beauty and a new insight into her sweet spirit, Until she became a book whose pages I could understand and whose praises I could sing, but which I could never finish reading. A woman whom Providence has provided with beauty of spirit and body is a truth, at the same time both open and secret, which we can understand only by love, and touch only by virtue; and when we attempt to describe such a woman she disappears like vapor.

Selma Karamy had bodily and spiritual beauty, but how can I describe her to one who never knew her? Can a dead man remember the singing of a nightingale and the fragrance of a rose and the sigh of a brook? Can a prisoner who is heavily loaded with shackles follow the breeze of the dawn? Is not silence more painful than death? Does pride prevent me from describing Selma in plain words since I cannot draw her truthfully with luminous colors? A hungry man in a desert will not refuse to eat dry bread if Heaven does not shower him with manna and quails.

In her white silk dress, Selma was slender as a ray of moonlight coming through the window. She walked gracefully and rhythmically. Her voice was low and sweet; words fell from her lips like drops of dew falling from the petals of flowers when they are disturbed by the wind.

But Selma's face！No words can describe its expression, reflecting first great internal suffering, then heavenly exaltation.

The beauty of Selma's face was not classic; it was like a dream of revelation which cannot be measured or bound or copied by the brush of a painter or the chisel of a sculptor. Selma's beauty was not in her golden hair, but in the virtue of purity which surrounded it; not in her large eyes, but in the light which emanated from them; not in her red lips, but in the sweetness of her words; not in her ivory neck, but in its slight bow to the front. Nor was it in her perfect figure, but in the nobility of her spirit, burning like a white torch between earth and sky. Her beauty was like a gift of poetry. But poets care unhappy people, for, no matter how high their spirits reach, they will still be enclosed in an envelope of tears.

Selma was deeply thoughtful rather than talkative, and her silence was a kind of music that carried one to a world of dreams and made him listen to the throbbing of his heart, and see the ghosts of his thoughts and feelings standing before him, looking him in the eyes.

She wore a cloak of deep sorrow through her life, which increased her strange beauty and dignity, as a tree in blossom is more lovely when seen through the mist of dawn.

Sorrow linked her spirit and mine, as if each saw in the other's face what the heart was feeling and heard the echo of a hidden voice. God had made two bodies in one, and separation could be nothing but agony.

The sorrowful spirit finds rest when united with a similar one. They join affectionately, as a stranger is cheered when he sees another stranger in a strange land. Hearts that are united through the medium of sorrow will not be separated by the glory of happiness. Love that is cleansed by tears will remain externally pure and beautiful.





The Tempest


One day Farris Effandi invited me to dinner at his home. I accepted, my spirit hungry for the divine bread which Heaven placed in the hands of Selma, the spiritual bread which makes our hearts hungrier the more we eat of it. It was this bread which Kais, the Arabian poet, Dante, and Sappho tasted and which set their hearts afar; the bread which the Goddess prepares with the sweetness of kisses and the bitterness of tears.

As I reached the home of Farris Effandi, I saw Selma sitting on a bench in the garden resting her head against a tree and looking like a bride in her white silk dress, or like a sentinel guarding that place.

Silently and reverently I approached and sat by her. I could not talk; so I resorted to silence, the only language of the heart, but I felt that Selma was listening to my wordless call and watching the ghost of my soul in my eyes.

In a few minutes the old man came out and greeted me as usual. When he stretched his hand toward me, I felt as if he were blessing the secrets that united me and his daughter. Then he said, “Dinner is ready, my children; let us eat.” We rose and followed him, and Selma's eyes brightened; for a new sentiment had been added to her love by her father's calling us his children.

We sat at the table enjoying the food and sipping the old wine, but our souls were living in a world far away. We were dreaming of the future and its hardships.

Three persons were separated in thoughts, but united in love; three innocent people with much feeling but little knowledge; a drama was being performed by an old man who loved his daughter and cared for her happiness, a young woman of twenty looking into the future with anxiety, and a young man, dreaming and worrying, who had tasted neither the wine of life nor its vinegar, and trying to reach the height of love and knowledge but unable to life himself up. We three sitting in twilight were eating and drinking in that solitary home, guarded by Heaven's eyes, but at the bottoms of our glasses were hidden bitterness and anguish.

As we finished eating, one of the maids announced the presence of a man at the door who wished to see Farris Effandi. “Who is he?” asked the old man. “The Bishop's messenger,” said the maid. There was a moment of silence during which Farris Effandi stared at his daughter like a prophet who gazes at Heaven to divine its secret. Then he said to the maid, “Let the man in.”

As the maid left, a man, dressed in oriental uniform and with big mustache curled at the ends, entered and greeted the old man, saying “His Grace, the Bishop, has sent me for you with his private carriage; he wishes to discuss important business with you.” The old man's face clouded and his smile disappeared. After a moment of deep thought he came close to me and said in a friendly voice, “I hope to find you here when I come back, for Selma will enjoy your company in this solitary place.”

Saying this, he turned to Selma and, smiling, asked if she agreed. She nodded her head, but her cheeks became red, and with a voice sweeter than the music of the lyre she said, “I will do my best, Father, to make our guest happy.”

Selma watched the carriage that had taken her father and the Bishop's messenger until it disappeared. Then she came and sat opposite me on a divan covered with green silk. She looked like a lily bent to the carpet of green grass by the breeze of dawn. It was the will of Heaven that I should be with Selma alone, at night, in her beautiful home surrounded by trees, where silence, love, beauty and virtue dwelt together.

We were both silent, each waiting for the other to speak, but speech is not the only means of understanding between two souls. It is not the syllables that come from the lips and tongues that bring hearts together.

There is something greater and purer than what the mouth utters. Silence illuminates our souls, whispers to our hearts, and brings them together. Silence separates us from ourselves, makes us sail the firmament of spirit, and brings us closer to Heaven; it makes us feel that bodies are no more than prisons and that this world is only a place of exile.

Selma looked at me and her eyes revealed the secret of her heart. Then she quietly said, “Let us go to the garden and sit under the trees and watch the moon come up behind the mountains.” Obediently I rose from my seat, but I hesitated.

“Don't you think we had better stay here until the moon has risen and illuminates the garden?” And I continued, “The darkness hides the trees and flowers. We can see nothing.” Then she said, “If darkness hides the trees and flowers from our eyes, it will not hide love from our hearts.”

Uttering these words in a strange tone, she turned her eyes and looked through the window. I remained silent, pondering her words, weighing the true meaning of each syllable. Then she looked at me as if she regretted what she had said and tried to take away those words from my ears by the magic of her eyes. But those eyes, instead of making me forget what she had said, repeated through the depths of my heart more clearly and effectively the sweet words which had already become graven in my memory for eternity.

Every beauty and greatness in this world is created by a single thought or emotion inside a man. Every thing we see today, made by past generation, was, before its appearance, a thought in the mind of a man or an impulse in the heart of a woman. The revolutions that shed so much blood and turned men's minds toward liberty were the idea of one man who lived in the midst of thousands of men. The devastating wars which destroyed empires were a thought that existed in the mind of an individual. The supreme teachings that changed the course of humanity were the ideas of a man whose genius separated him from his environment. A single thought build the Pyramids, founded the glory of Islam, and caused the burning of the library at Alexandria.

One thought will come to you at night which will elevate you to glory or lead you to asylum. One look from a woman's eye makes you the happiest man in the world. One word from a man's lips will make you rich or poor.

That word which Selma uttered that night arrested me between my past and future, as a boat which is anchored in the midst of the ocean. That word awakened me from the slumber of youth and solitude and set me on the stage where life and death play their parts.

The scent of flowers mingled with the breeze as we came into the garden and sat silently on a bench near a jasmine tree, listening to the breathing of sleeping nature, while in the blue sky the eyes of heaven witnessed our drama.

The moon came out from behind Mount Sannin and shone over the coast, hills, and mountains; and we could see the villages fringing the valley like apparitions which have suddenly been conjured from nothing. We could see the beauty of Lebanon under the silver rays of the moon.

Poets of the West think of Lebanon as a legendary place, forgotten since the passing of David and Solomon and the Prophets, as the Garden of Eden became lost after the fall of Adam and Eve. To those Western poets, the word “Lebanon” is a poetical expression associated with a mountain whose sides are drenched with the incense of the Holy Cedars. It reminds them of the temples of copper and marble standing stern and impregnable and of a herd of deer feeding in the valleys. That night I saw Lebanon dream-like with the eyes of a poet.

Thus, the appearance of things changes according to the emotions, and thus we see magic and beauty in them, while the magic and beauty are really in ourselves.

As the rays of the moon shone on the face, neck, and arms of Selma, she looked like a statue of ivory sculptured by the fingers of some worshiper of Ishtar, goddess of beauty and love. As she looked at me, she said, “Why are you silent? Why do you not tell me something about your past?” As I gazed at her, my muteness vanished, and I opened my lips and said, “Did you not hear what I said when we came to this orchard? The spirit that hears the whispering of flowers and the singing of silence can also hear the shrieking of my soul and the clamor of my heart.”

She covered her face with her hands and said in a trembling voice, “Yes, I heard you—I heard a voice coming from the bosom of night and a clamor raging in the heart of the day.”

Forgetting my past, my very existence—everything but Selma—I answered her, saying, “And I heard you, too, Selma. I heard exhilarating music pulsing in the air and causing the whole universe to tremble.”

Upon hearing these words, she closed her eyes and her lips I saw a smile of pleasure mingled with sadness. She whispered softly, “Now I know that there is something higher than heaven and deeper than the ocean and stranger than life and death and time. I know now what I did not know before.”

At that moment Selma became dearer than a friend and closer than a sister and more beloved than a sweetheart. She became a supreme thought, a beautiful, an overpowering emotion living in my spirit.

It is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship. Love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment, it will not be created in years or even generations.

Then Selma raised her head and gazed at the horizon where Mount Sannin meets the sky, and said, “Yesterday you were like a brother to me, with whom I lived and by whom I sat calmly under my father's care. Now, I feel the presence of something stranger and sweeter than brotherly affection, an unfamiliar commingling of love and fear that fills my heart with sorrow and happiness.”

I responded, “This emotion which we fear and which shakes us when it passes through our hearts is the law of nature that guides the moon around the earth and the sun around the God.”

She put her hand on my head and wove her fingers thought my hair. Her face brightened and tears came out of her eyes like drops of dew on the leaves of a lily, and she said, “Who would believe our story—who would believe that in this hour we have surmounted the obstacles of doubt? Who would believe that the month of Nisan which brought us together for the first time, is the month that halted us in the Holy of Holies of life?”

Her hand was still on my head as she spoke, and I would not have preferred a royal crown or a wreath of glory to that beautiful smooth hand whose fingers were twined in my hair.

Then I answered her： “People will not believe our story because they do not know what love is the only flower that grows and blossoms without the aid of seasons, but was it Nisan that brought us together for the first time, and is it this hour that has arrested us in the Holy of Holies of life? Is it not the hand of God that brought our souls close together before birth and made us prisoners of each other for all the days and nights? Man's life does not commence in the womb and never ends in the grave; and this firmament, full of moonlight and stars, is not deserted by loving souls and intuitive spirits.”

As she drew her hand away from my head, I felt a kind of electrical vibration at the roots of my hair mingled with the night breeze. Like a devoted worshiper who receives his blessing by kissing the altar in a shrine, I took Selma's hand, placed my burning lips on it, and gave it a long kiss, the memory of which melts my heart and awakens by its sweetness all the virtue of my spirit.

An hour passed, every minute of which was a year of love. The silence of the night, moonlight, flowers, and trees made us forget all reality except love, when suddenly we heard the galloping of horses and rattling of carriage wheels. Awakened from our pleasant swoon and plunged from the world of dreams into the world of perplexity and misery, we found that the old man had returned from his mission. We rose and walked through the orchard to meet him.

Then the carriage reached the entrance of the garden, Farris Effandi dismounted and slowly walked towards us, bending forward slightly as if he were carrying a heavy load. He approached Selma and placed both of his hands on her shoulders and stared at her. Tears coursed down his wrinkled cheeks and his lips trembled with sorrowful smile. In a choking voice, he said, “My beloved Selma, very soon you will be taken away from the arms of your father to the arms of another man. Very soon fate will carry you from this lonely home to the world's spacious court, and this garden will miss the pressure of your footsteps, and your father will become a stranger to you. All is done; may God bless you.”

Hearing these words, Selma's face clouded and her eyes froze as if she felt a premonition of death. Then she screamed, like a bird shot down, suffering, and trembling, and in a choked voice said, “What do you say? What do you mean? Where are you sending me?”

Then she looked at him searchingly, trying to discover his secret. In a moment she said, “I understand. I understand everything. The Bishop has demanded me from you and has prepared a cage for this bird with broken wings. Is this your will, Father?”

His answer was a deep sigh. Tenderly he led Selma into the house while I remained standing in the garden, waves of perplexity beating upon me like a tempest upon autumn leaves. Then I followed them into the living room, and to avoid embarrassment, shook the old man's hand, looked at Selma, my beautiful star, and left the house.

As I reached the end of the garden I heard the old man calling me and turned to meet him. Apologetically he took my hand and said, “Forgive me, my son. I have ruined your evening with the shedding of tears, but please come to see me when my house is deserted and I am lonely and desperate. Youth, my dear son, does not combine with senility, as morning does not have meet the night; but you will come to me and call to my memory the youthful days which I spent with your father, and you will tell me the news of life which does not count me as among its sons any longer. Will you not visit me when Selma leaves and I am left here in loneliness?”

While he said these sorrowful words and I silently shook his hand, I felt the warm tears falling from his eyes upon my hand. Trembling with sorrow and filial affection. I felt as if my heart were choked with grief. When I raised my head and he saw the tears in my eyes, he bent toward me and touched my forehead with his lips. “Good-bye, son, good-bye.”

An old man's tear is more potent than that of a young man because it is the residuum of life in his weakening body. A young man's tear is like a drop of dew on the leaf of a rose, while that of an old man is like a yellow leaf which falls with the wind at the approach of winter.

As I left the house of Farris Effandi Karamy, Selma's voice still rang in my ears, her beauty followed me like a wraith, and her father's tears dried slowly on my hand.

My departure was like Adam's exodus from Paradise, but the Eve of my heart was not with me to make the whole world an Eden. That night, in which I had been born again, I felt that I saw death's face for the first time.

Thus the sun enlivens and kills the fields with its heat.





Lake of Fire


Everything that a man does secretly in the darkness of night will be clearly revealed in the daylight. Words uttered in privacy will become unexpectedly common conversation. Deed which we hide today in the corners of our lodgings will be shouted on every street tomorrow.

Thus the ghosts of darkness revealed the purpose of Bishop Bulos Galib's meeting with Farris Effandi Karamy, and his conversation was repeated all over the neighborhood until it reached my ears.

The discussion that took place between Bishop Buols Galib and Farris Effandi that night was not over the problems of the poor or the widows and orphans. The main purpose for sending after Farris Effandi and bringing him in the Bishops' private carriage was the betrothal of Selma to the Bishop's nephew, Mansour Bey Galib.

Selma was the only child of the wealthy Farris Effandi, and the Bishop's choice fell on Selma, not on account of her beauty and noble spirit, but on account of her father's money which would guarantee Mansour Bey a good and prosperous fortune and make him an important man.

The heads of religion in the East are not satisfied with their own munificence, but they must strive to make all members of their families superiors and oppressors. The glory of a prince goes to his eldest son by inheritance, but the exaltation of a religious head is contagious among his brothers and nephews. Thus the Christian bishop and the Moslem imam and the Brahman priest become like sea reptiles who clutch their prey with many tentacles and suck their blood with numerous mouths.

When the Bishop demanded Selma's hand for his nephew, the only answer that he received from her father was a deep silence and falling tears, for he hated to lose his only child. Any man's soul trembles when he is separated from his only daughter whom he has reared to young womanhood.

The sorrow of parents at the marriage of a daughter is equal to their happiness at the marriage of a son, because a son brings to the family a new member, while a daughter, upon her marriage, is lost to them.

Farris Effandi perforce granted the Bishop's request, obeying his will unwillingly, because Farris Effandi knew the Bishop's nephew very well, knew that he was dangerous, full of hate, wickedness, and corruption.

In Lebanon, no Christian could oppose his bishop and remain in good standing. No man could disobey his religious head and keep his reputation. The eye could not resist a spear without being pierced, and the hand could not grasp a sword without being cut off.

Suppose that Farris Effandi had resisted the Bishop and refused his wish; then Selma's reputation would have been ruined and her name would have been blemished by the dirt of lips and tongues. In the opinion of the fox, high bunches of grapes that can't be reached are sour.

Thus destiny seized Selma and led her like a humiliated slave in the procession of miserable oriental woman, and thus fell that noble spirit into the trap after having flown freely on the white wings of love in a sky full of moonlight scented with the odor of flowers.

In some countries, the parent's wealth is a source of misery for the children. The wide strong box which the father and mother together have used for the safety of their wealth becomes a narrow, dark prison for the souls of their heirs. The Almighty Dinar which the people worship becomes a demon which punished the spirit and deadens the heart. Selma Karamy was one of those who were the victims of their parents' wealth and bridegrooms' cupidity. Had it not been for her father's wealth, Selma would still be living happily.

A week had passed. The love of Selma was my sole entertainer, singing songs of happiness for me at night and waking me at dawn to reveal the meaning of life and the secrets of nature. It is a heavenly love that is free from jealousy, rich and never harmful to the spirit. It is deep affinity that bathes the soul in contentment; a deep hunger for affection which, when satisfied, fills the soul with bounty; a tenderness that creates hope without agitating the soul, changing earth to paradise and life to a sweet and a beautiful dream. In the morning, when I walked in the fields, I saw the token of Eternity in the awakening of nature, and when I sat by the seashore I heard the waves singing the song of Eternity. And when I walked in the streets I saw the beauty of life and the splendor of humanity in the appearance of passers-by and movements of workers.

Those days passed like ghosts and disappeared like clouds, and soon nothing was left for me but sorrowful memories. The eye with which I used to look at the beauty of spring and the awakening of nature, could see nothing but the fury of the tempest and the misery of winter. The ears with which I formerly heard with delight the song of the waves, could hear only the howling of the wind and the wrath of the sea against the precipice. The soul which had observed happily the tireless vigor of mankind and the glory of the universe, was tortured by the knowledge of disappointment and failure. Nothing was more beautiful than those days of love, and nothing was more bitter than those horrible nights of sorrow.

When I could no longer resist the impulse, I went, on the weekend, once more to Selma's home—the shrine which Beauty had erected and which Love had blessed, in which the spirit could worship and the heart kneel humbly and pray. When I entered the garden I felt a power pulling me away from this world and placing me in a sphere supernaturally free from struggle and hardship. Like a mystic who receives a revelation of Heaven, I saw myself amid the trees and flowers, and as I approached the entrance of the house I beheld Selma sitting on the bench in the shadow of a jasmine tree where we both had sat the week before, on that night which Providence had chosen for the beginning of my happiness and sorrow.

She neither moved nor spoke as I approached her. She seemed to have known intuitively that I was coming, and when I sat by her she gazed at me for a moment and sighed deeply, then turned her head and looked at the sky. And, after a moment full of magic silence, she turned back toward me and tremblingly took my hand and said in a faint voice, “Look at me, my friend; study my face and I read in it that which you want to know and which I can not recite. Look at me, my beloved…… look at me, my brother.”

I gazed at her intently and saw that those eyes, which a few days ago were smiling like lips and moving like the wings of a nightingale, eyes were already sunken and glazed with sorrow and pain. Her face, that had resembled the unfolding, sunkissed leaves of a lily, had faded and become colorless. Her sweet lips were like two withering roses that autumn has left on their stems. Her neck, that had been a column of ivory, was bent forward as if it no longer could support the burden of grief in her head.

All these changes I saw in Selma's face, but to me they were like a passing cloud that covered the face of the moon and makes it more beautiful. A look which reveals inward stress adds more beauty to the face, no matter how much tragedy and pain it bespeaks; but the face which, in silence, does not announce hidden mysteries is not beautiful, regardless of the symmetry of its features. The cup does not entice our lips unless the wine's color is seen through the transparent crystal.

Selma, on that evening, was like a cup full of heavenly wine concocted of the bitterness and sweetness of life. Unaware, she symbolized the oriental woman who never leaves her parents' home until she puts upon her neck the heavy yoke of her husband, who never leaves her loving mother's arms until she must live as a slave, enduring the harshness of her husband's mother.

I continued to look at Selma and listen to her depressed spirit and suffer with her until I felt that time has ceased and the universe had faded from existence. I could see only her two large eyes staring fixedly at me and could feel only her cold, trembling hand holding mine.

I woke from my swoon hearing Selma saying quietly, “Come by beloved, let us discuss the horrible future before it comes, My father has just left the house to see the man who is going to be my companion until death. My father, whom God chose for the purpose of my existence, will meet the man whom the world has selected to be my master for the rest of my life. In the heart of this city, the old man who accompanied me during my youth will meet the young man who will be my companion for the coming years. Tonight the two families will set the marriage date. What a strange and impressive hour！Last week at this time, under this jasmine tree, Love embraced my soul for the first time, okay. While Destiny was writing the first word of my life's story at the Bishop's mansion. Now, while my father and my suitor are planning the day of marriage, I see your spirit quivering around me as a thirsty bird flickers above a spring of water guarded by a hungry serpent. Oh, how great this night is！And how deep is its mystery！”

Hearing these words, I felt that dark ghost of complete despondency was seizing our love to choke it in its infancy, and I answered her, “That bird will remain flickering over that spring until thirst destroys him or falls into the grasp of a serpent and becomes its prey.”

She responded, “No, my beloved, this nightingale should remain alive and sing until dark comes, until spring passes, until the end of the world, and keep on singing eternally. His voice should not be silenced, because he brings life to my heart, his wings should not be broken, because their motion removes the cloud from my heart.

Then I whispered, “Selma, my beloved, thirst will exhaust him, and fear will kill him.”

She replied immediately with trembling lips, “The thirst of soul is sweeter than the wine of material things, and the fear of spirit is dearer than the security of the body. But listen, my beloved, listen carefully, I am standing today at the door of a new life which I know nothing about. I am like a blind man who feels his way so that he will not fall. My father's wealth has placed me in the slave market, and this man has bought me. I neither know nor love him, but I shall learn to love him, and I shall obey him, serve him, and make him happy. I shall give him all that a weak woman can give a strong man.

But you, my beloved, are still in the prime of life. You can walk freely upon life's spacious path, carpeted with flowers. You are free to traverse the world, making of your heart a torch to light your way. You can think, talk, and act freely; you can write your name on the face of life because you are a man; you can live as a master because your father's wealth will not place you in the slave market to be bought and sold; you can marry the woman of your choice and, before she lives in your home, you can let her reside in your heart and can exchange confidences without hindrances.”

Silence prevailed for a moment, and Selma continued, “But, is it now that Life will tear us apart so that you may attain the glory of a man and I the duty of a woman? Is it for this that the valley swallows the song of the nightingale in its depths, and the wind scatters the petals of the rose, and the feet tread upon the wind cup? Were all those nights we spent in the moonlight by the jasmine tree, where our souls united, in vain? Did we fly swiftly toward the stars until our wings tired, and are we descending now into the abyss? Or was Love asleep when he came to us, and did he, when he woke, become angry and decide to punish us? Or did our spirits turn the nights' breeze into a wind that tore us to pieces and blew us like dust to the depth of the valley? We disobeyed no commandment, nor did we taste of forbidden fruit, so what is making us leave this paradise? We never conspired or practiced mutiny, then why are we descending to hell? No, no, the moments which united us are greater than centuries, and the light that illuminated our spirits is stronger than the dark; and if the tempest separates us on this rough ocean, the waves will unite us on the calm shore; and if this life kills us, death will unite us. A woman's heart will change with time or season; even if it dies eternally, it will never perish. A woman's heart is like a field turned into a battleground; after the trees are uprooted and the grass is burned and the rocks are reddened with blood and the earth is planted with bones and skulls, it is calm and silent as if nothing has happened; for the spring and autumn come at their intervals and resume their work.

And now, my beloved, what shall we do? How shall we part and when shall we meet? Shall we consider love a strange visitor who came in the evening and left us in the morning? Or shall we suppose this affection a dream that came in our sleep and departed when we awoke?

Shall we consider this week an hour of intoxication to be replaced by soberness? Raise your head and let me look at you, my beloved; open your lips and let me hear your voice. Speak to me！Will you remember me after this tempest has sunk the ship of our love? Will you hear the whispering of my wings in the silence of the night? Will you hear my spirit fluttering over you? Will you listen to my sighs? Will you see my shadow approach with the shadows of dusk and disappear with the flush of dawn? Tell me, my beloved, what will you be after having been magic ray to my eyes, sweet song to my ears, and wings to my soul? What will you be?”

Hearing these words, my heart melted, and I answered her, “ I will be as you want me to be, my beloved.”

Then she said, “ I want you to love me as a poet loves his sorrowful thoughts. I want you to remember me as a traveler remembers a calm pool in which his image was reflected as he drank its water. I want you to remember me as a mother remember her child that died before it saw the light, and I want you to remember me as a merciful king remembers a prisoner who died before his pardon reached him. I want you to be my companion, and I want you to visit my father and console him in his solitude because I shall be leaving him soon and shall be a stranger to him. I answered her, saying, “ I will do all you have said and will make my soul an envelope for your soul, and my heart a residence for your beauty and my breast a grave for your sorrows. I shall love you, Selma, as the prairies love the spring, and I shall live in you in the life of a flower under the sun's rays. I shall sing your name as the valley sings the echo of the bells of the village churches; I shall listen to the language of your soul as the shore listens to the story of the waves. I shall remember you as a stranger remembers his beloved country, and as a hungry man remembers a banquet, and as a dethroned king remembers the days of his glory, and as a prisoner remembers the hours of ease and freedom. I shall remember you as a sower remembers the bundles of wheat on his threshing flour, and as a shepherd remembers the green prairies the sweet brooks.”

Selma listened to my words with palpitating heart, and said “Tomorrow the truth will become ghostly and the awakening will be like a dream. Will a lover be satisfied embracing a ghost, or will a thirsty man quench his thirst from the spring or a dream?”

I answered her, “Tomorrow, destiny will put you in the midst of a peaceful family, but it will send me into the world of struggle and warfare. You will be in the home of a person whom chance has made most fortunate through your beauty and virtue, while I shall be living a life of suffering and fear. You will enter the gate of life, while I shall enter the gate of death. You will be received hospitably, while I shall exist in solitude, but I shall erect a statue of love and worship it in the valley of death. Love will be my sole comforter, and I shall drink love like wine and wear it like garment. At dawn, Love will wake me from slumber and take me to the distant field, and at noon will lead me to the shadows of trees, where I will find shelter with the birds from the heat of the sun. In the evening, it will cause me to pause before sunset to hear nature's farewell song to the light of day and will show me ghostly clouds sailing in the sky. At night, Love will embrace me, and I shall sleep, dreaming of the heavenly world where the spirits of lovers and poets abide. In the Spring I shall walk side by side with love among violets and jasmines and drink the remaining drops of winter in the lily cups. In Summer we shall make the bundles of hay our pillows and the grass our bed, and the blue sky will cover us as we gaze at the stars and the moon. In Autumn, Love and I will go to the vineyard and sit by the wine press and watch the grapevines being denuded of their golden ornaments, and the migrating flocks of birds will wing over us. In Winter, we shall sit by the fireside reciting stories of long ago and chronicles of far countries. During my youth, Love will be my teacher; in middle age, my help; and in old age, my delight. Love, my beloved Selma, will stay with me to the end of my life, and after death the hand of God will unite us again.”

All these words came from the depths of my heart like flames of fire which leap raging from the hearth and then disappear in the ashes. Selma was weeping as if her eyes were lips answering me with tears.

Those whom love has not given wings cannot fly the cloud of appearances to see the magic world in which Selma's spirit and mine existed together in that sorrowfully happy hour. Those whom Love has not chosen as followers do not hear when Love calls. This story is not for them. Even if they should comprehend these pages, they would not be able to grasp the shadowy meanings which are not clothed in words and do not reside on paper, but what human being is he who has never sipped the wine from the cup of love, and what spirit is it that has never stood reverently before that lighted altar in the temple whose pavement is the hearts of men and women and whose ceiling is the secret canopy of dreams? What flower is that on whose leaves the dawn has never poured a drop of dew; what streamlet is that which lost its course without going to the sea?

Selma raised her face toward the sky and gazed at the heavenly stars which studded the firmament. She stretched out her hands; her eyes widened, and her lips trembled. On her pale face, I could see the signs of sorrow, oppression, hopelessness, and pain. Then she cried, “ Oh, Lord, what has a woman done that hath offended Thee? What sin has she committed to deserve such a punishment? For what crime has she been awarded everlasting castigation? Oh, Lord, Thou art strong, and I am weak. Why hast Thou made me suffer pain? Thou art great and almighty, while I am nothing but a tiny creature crawling before Thy throne. Why hast Thou crushed me with Thy foot? Thou art a raging tempest, and I am like dust; why, my Lord, hast Thou flung me upon the cold earth? Thou art powerful, and I am helpless; why art Thou fighting me? Thou art considerate, and I am prudent; why art Thou destroying me? Thou hast created woman with love, and why, with love, dost Thou ruin her? With Thy right hand dost Thou lift her, and with Thy left hand dost Thou strike her into the abyss, and she knows not why. In her mouth Thou blowest the breath of Life, and in her heart Thou sowest the seeds of death. Thou dost show her the path of happiness, but Thou leadest her in the road of misery; in her mouth Thou dost place a song of happiness, but then Thou dost close her lips with sorrow and dost fetter her tongue with agony. With Thy mysterious fingers dost Thou dress her wounds, and with Thine hands Thou drawest the dread of pain round her pleasures. In her bed Thou hidest pleasure and peace, but beside it Thou dost erect obstacles and fear. Thou dost excite her affection through Thy will, and from her affection does shame emanate. By Thy will Thou showest her the beauty of creation, but her love for beauty becomes a terrible famine. Thou dost make her drink life in the cup of death, and death in the cup of life. Thou purifiest her with tears, and in tears her life streams away. Oh, Lord, Thou hast opened my eyes with love, and with love Thou hast blinded me. Thou hast kissed me with Thy lips and struck me with Thy strong hand. Thou has planted in my heart a white rose, but around the rose a barrier of thorns. Thou hast tied my present with the spirit of a young man whom I love, but my life with the body of an unknown man. So help me, my Lord, to be strong in this deadly struggle and assist me to be truthful and virtuous until death. Thy will be done. Oh, Lord God.”

Silence continued. Selma looked down, pale and frail; her arms dropped, and her head bowed and it seemed to me as if a tempest had broken a branch from a tree and cast it down to dry and perish.

I took her cold hand and kissed it, but when I attempted to console her it was I who needed consolation more than she did. I kept silent, thinking of our plight and listening to my heartbeats. Neither of us said more.

Extreme torture is mute, and so we sat silent, petrified, like columns of marble buried under the sand of an earthquake. Neither wished to listen to the other because our heart-threads had become weak and even breathing would have broken them.

It was midnight, and we could see the crescent moon rising from behind Mount Sannin, and it looked in the midst of the stars, like the face of a corpse, in a coffin surrounded by the dim lights of candles. And Lebanon looked like an old man whose back was bent with age and whose eyes were a haven for insomnia, watching the dark and waiting for dawn, like asking sitting on the ashes of his throne in the debris of his palace.

The mountains, trees, and rivers change their appearance with the vicissitudes of times and seasons, as a man changes with his experiences and emotions. The lofty poplar that resembles a bride in the daytime, will look like a column of smoke in the evening; the huge rock that stands impregnable at noon, will appear to be a miserable pauper at night, with earth for his bed and the sky for his cover; and the rivulet that we see glittering in the morning and hear singing the hymn of Eternity, will, in the evening, turn to a stream of tears wailing like a mother bereft of her child, and Lebanon, that had looked dignified a week before, when the moon was full and our spirits were happy, looked sorrowful and lonesome that night.

He stood up and bade each other farewell, but love and despair stood between us like two ghosts, one stretching his wings with his fingers over our throats, one weeping and the other laughing hideously.

As I took Selma's hand and put it to my lips, she came close to me and placed a kiss on my forehead, then dropped on the wooden bench. She shut her eyes and whispered softly, “Oh, Lord God, have mercy on me and mend my broken wings！”

As I left Selma in the garden, I felt as if my senses were covered with a thick veil, like a lake whose surface is concealed by fog.

The beauty of trees, the moonlight, the deep silence, everything about me looked ugly and horrible. The true light that had showed me the beauty and wonder of the universe was converted to a great flame of fire that seared my heart; and the Eternal music I used to hear became a clamor, more frightening than the roar of a lion.

I reached my room, and like a wounded bird shot down by a hunter, I fell on my bed, repeating the words of Selma： “Oh, Lord God, have mercy on me and mend my broken wings！”





Before the Throne of Death


Marriage in these days is a mockery whose management is in the hands of young men and parents. In most countries the young men win while the parents lose. The woman is looked upon as a commodity, purchased and delivered from one house to another. In time her beauty fades and she becomes like an old piece of furniture left in a dark corner.

Modern civilization has made woman a little wiser, but it has increased her suffering because of man's covetousness. The woman of yesterday was a happy wife, but the woman of today is a miserable mistress. In the past she walked blindly in the light, but now she walks open-eyed in the dark. She was beautiful in her ignorance, virtuous in her simplicity, and strong in her weakness. Today she has become ugly in her ingenuity, superficial and heartless in her knowledge. Will the day ever come when beauty and knowledge, ingenuity and virtue, and weakness of body and strength of spirit will be united in a woman?

I am one of those who believe that spiritual progress is a rule of human life, but the approach to perfection is slow and painful. If a woman elevates herself in one respect and is retarded in another, it is because the rough trail that leads to the mountain peak is not free of ambushes of thieves and lairs of wolves.

This strange generation exists between sleeping and waking. It holds in its hands the soil of the past and the seeds of the future. However, we find in every city a woman who symbolizes the future.

In the city of Beirut, Selma Karamy was the symbol of the future Oriental woman, but, like many who lie ahead of their time, she became the victim of the present; and like a flower snatched from its stem and carried away by the current of a river, she walked in the miserable procession of the defeated.

Mansour Bey Galib and Selma were married, and lived together in a beautiful house at Ras Beyrouth, where all the wealthy dignitaries resided. Farris Effandi Karamy was left in his solitary home in the midst of his garden and orchards like a lonely shepherd amid his flock. The days and merry nights of the wedding passed, but the honeymoon left memories of times of bitter sorrow, as wars leave skulls and dead bones on the battlefield. The dignity of an Oriental wedding inspires the hearts of young men and women, but its termination may drop them like millstones to the bottom of the sea. Their exhilaration is like footprints on sand which remain only till they are washed away by the waves. Spring departed, and so did summer and autumn, but my love for Selma increased day by day until it became a kind of mute worship, the feeling that an orphan has toward the soul of his mother in Heaven. My yearning was converted to blind sorrow that could see nothing but itself, and the passion that drew tears from my eyes was replaced by perplexity that sucked the blood from my heart, and my sighs of affection became a constant prayer for the happiness of Selma and her husband and peace for her father.

My hopes and prayers were in vain, because Selma's misery was an internal malady that nothing but death could cure.

Mansour Bey was a man to whom all the luxuries of life came easily; but, in spite of that, he was dissatisfied and rapacious. After marrying Selma, he neglected her father in his loneliness and prayed for his death so that he could inherit what was left of the old man's wealth.

Mansour Bey's character was similar to his uncle's; the only difference between the two was that the Bishop got everything he wanted secretly, under the protection of his ecclesiastical robe and the golden cross which he wore on his chest, while his nephew did everything publicly. The Bishop went to church in the morning and spent the rest of the day pilfering from the widows, orphans, and simple minded people. But Mansour Bey spent his days in pursuit of sexual satisfaction. On Sunday, Bishop Bulos Galib preached his Gospel; but during weekdays he never practiced what he preached, occupying himself with political intrigues of the locality. And, by means of his uncle's prestige and influence, Mansour Bey made it his business to secure political plums for those who could offer a sufficient bribe.

Bishop Bulos was a thief who hid himself under the cover of night, while his nephew, Mansour Bey, was a swindler who walked proudly in daylight. However, the people of Oriental nations place trust in such as they—wolves and butchers who ruin their country through covetousness and crush their neighbors with an iron hand.

Why do I occupy these pages with words about the betrayers of poor nations instead of reserving all the space for the story of a miserable woman with a broken heart? Why do I shed tears for oppressed peoples rather than keep all my tears for the memory of a weak woman whose life was snatched by the teeth of death?

But my dear readers, don't you think that such a woman is like a nation that is oppressed by priests and rulers? Don't you believe that thwarted love which leads a woman to the grave is like the despair which pervades the people of the earth? A woman is to a nation as light is to a lamp. Will not the light be dim if the oil in the lamp is low?

Autumn passed, and the wind blew the yellow leaves from the trees, making way for winter, which came howling and crying. I was still in the City of Beirut without a companion save my dreams, which would lift my spirit to the sky and then bury it deep in the bosom of the earth.

The sorrowful spirit finds relaxation in solitude. It abhors people, as a wounded deer deserts the herd and lives in a cave until it is healed or dead.

One day I heard Farris Effandi was ill. I left my solitary abode and walked to his home, taking a new route, a lonely path between olive trees, avoiding the main road with its rattling carriage wheels.

Arriving at the old man's house, I entered and found Farris Effandi lying on his bed, weak and pale. His eyes were sunken and looked like two deep, dark valleys haunted by the ghosts of pain. The smile which had always enlivened his face was choked with pain and agony; and the bones of his gentle hands looked like naked branches trembling before the tempest. As I approached him and inquired as to his health, he turned his pale face toward me, and on his trembling lips appeared a smile, and he said in a weak voice, “Go—go, my son, to the other room and comfort Selma and bring her to sit by the side of my bed.”

I entered the adjacent room and found Selma lying on a divan, covering her head with her arms and burying her face in a pillow so that her father would not hear her weeping. Approaching slowly, I pronounced her name in a voice that seemed more like sighing than whispering. She moved fearfully, as if she had been interrupted in a terrible dream, and sat up, looking at me with glazed eyes, doubting whether I was a ghost or a living being. After a deep silence which took us back on the wings of memory to that hour when we were intoxicated with wine of love, Selma wiped away her tears and said, “See how time has changed us！See how time has changed the course of our lives and left us in these ruins. In this place spring united us in a bond of love, and in this place has brought us together before the throne of death. How beautiful was spring, and how terrible is this winter！”

Speaking thus, she covered her face again with her hands as if she were shielding her eyes from the specter of the past standing before her. I put my hand on her head and said, “Come, Selma, come and let us be as strong towers before the tempest. Let us stand like brave soldiers before the enemy and face his weapons. If we are killed, we shall die as martyrs; and if we win, we shall live as heroes. Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility. The butterfly that hovers around the lamp until it dies is more admirable than the mole that lives in a dark tunnel. Come, Selma, let us walk this rough path firmly, with our eyes toward the sun so that we may not see the skulls and serpents among the rocks and thorns. If fear should stop us in middle of the road, we would hear only ridicule from the voices of the night, but if we reach the mountain peak bravely we shall join the heavenly spirits in songs of triumph and joy. Cheer up, Selma, wipe away your tears and remove the sorrow from your face. Rise, and let us sit by the bed of your father, because his life depends on your life, and your smile is his only cure.”




Kindly and affectionately she looked at me and said, “Are you asking me to have patience, while you are in need of it yourself? Will a hungry man give his bread to another hungry man? Or will sick man give medicine to another which he himself needs badly?”

She rose, her head bent slightly forward and we walked to the old man's room and sat by the side of his bed. Selma forced a smile and pretended to be patient, and her father tried to make her believe that he was feeling better and getting stronger; but both father and daughter were aware of each other's sorrow and heard the unvoiced sighs. They were like two equal forces, wearing each other away silently. The father's heart was melting because of his daughter's plight. They were two pure souls, one departing and the other agonized with grief, embracing in love and death; and I was between the two with my own troubled heart. We were three people, gathered and crushed by the hands of destiny; an old man like a dwelling ruined by flood, a young woman whose symbol was a lily beheaded by the sharp edge of a sickle, and a young man who was a weak sapling, bent by a snowfall; and all of us were toys in the hands of fate.

Farris Effandi moved slowly and stretched his weak hand toward Selma, and in a loving and tender voice said, “Hold my hand, my beloved.” Selma held his hand; then he said, “I have lived long enough, and I have enjoyed the fruits of life's seasons. I have experienced all its phases with equanimity. I lost your mother when you were three years of age, and she left you as a precious treasure in my lap. I watched you grow, and your face reproduced your mother's features as stars reflected in a calm pool of water. Your character, intelligence, and beauty are your mother's, even your manner of speaking and gestures. You have been my only consolation in this life because you were the image of your mother in every deed and word. Now, I grow old, and my only resting place is between the soft wings of death. Be comforted, my beloved daughter, because I have lived long enough to see you as a woman. Be happy because I shall live in you after my death. My departure today would be no different from my going tomorrow or the day after, for our days are perishing like the leaves of autumn. The hour of my days are perishing like the leaves of autumn. The hour of my death approaches rapidly, and my soul is desirous of being united with your mother's.”

As he uttered these words sweetly and lovingly, his face was radiant. Then he put his hand under his pillow and pulled out a small picture in a gold frame. With his eyes on the little photograph, he said, “Come, Selma, come and see your mother in this picture.”

Selma wiped away her tears, and after gazing long at the picture, she kissed it repeatedly and cried, “Oh, my beloved mother！Oh, mother！” Then she placed her trembling lips on the picture as if she wished to pour her soul into that image.

The most beautiful word on the lips of mankind is the word “Mother,” and the most beautiful call is the call of “My mother.” it is a word full of hope and love, a sweet and kind word coming from the depths of the heart. The mother is every thing—she is our consolation in sorrow, our hope in misery, and our strength in weakness. She is the source of love, mercy, sympathy, and forgiveness. He who loses his mother loses a pure soul who blesses and guards him constantly.

Every thing in nature bespeaks the mother. The sun is the mother of earth and gives it its nourishment of hear; it never leaves the universe at night until it has put the earth to sleep to the song of the sea and the hymn of birds and brooks. And this earth is the mother of trees and flowers. It produces them, nurses them, and weans them. The trees and flowers become kind mothers of their great fruits and seeds. And the mother, the prototype of all existence, is the eternal spirit, full of beauty and love.

Selma Karamy never knew her mother because she had died when Selma was an infant, but Selma wept when she saw the picture and cried, “Oh, mother！” The word mother is hidden in our hearts, and it comes upon our lips in hours of sorrow and happiness as the perfume comes from the heart of the rose and mingles with clear and cloudy air.

Selma stared at her mother's picture, kissing it repeatedly, until she collapsed by her father's bed.

The old man placed both hands on her head and said, “I have shown you, my dear child, a picture of your mother on paper. Now listen to me and I shall let you hear her words.”

She lifted her head like a little bird in the nest that hears its mother's wing, and looked at him attentively.

Farris Effandi opened his mouth and said, “Your mother was nursing you when she lost her father; she cried and wept at his going, but she was wise and patient. She sat by me in this room as soon as the funeral was over and held my hand and said, ‘Farris, my father is dead now and you are my only consolation in this world. The heart's affections are divided like the branches of the cedar tree; if the tree loses one strong branch, it will suffer but it does not die. It will pour all its vitality into the next branch so that it will grow and fill the empty place.’ This is what your mother told me when her father died, and you should say the same thing when death takes my body to its resting place and my soul to God's care.”

Selma answered him with falling tears and broken heart, “When Mother lost her father, you took his place; but who is going to take yours when you are gone? She was left in the care of a loving and truthful husband; she found consolation in her little daughter, and who will be my consolation when you pass away? You have been my father and mother and the companion of my youth.”

Saying these words, she turned and looked at me, and, holding the side of my garment, said, “This is the only friend I shall have after you are gone, but how can he console me when he is suffering also? How can a broken heart find consolation in a disappointed soul? A sorrowful woman cannot be comforted by her neighbor's sorrow, nor can a bird fly with broken wings. He is the friend of my soul, but I have already placed a heavy burden of sorrow upon him and dimmed his eyes with my tears till he can see nothing but darkness. He is a brother whom I dearly love, but he is like all brothers who share my sorrow and help me shed tears which increase my bitterness and burn my heart.”

Selma's words stabbed my heart, and I felt that I could bear no more. The old man listened to her with depressed spirit. The old man listened to her with depressed spirit, trembling like the light of a lamp before the wind. Then he stretched out his hand and said, “Let me go peacefully, my child. I have broken the bars of this cage; let me fly and do not stop me, for your mother is calling me. The sky is clear and the sea is calm and the boat is ready to sail; do not delay its voyage. Let my body rest with those who are resting; let my dream end and my soul awaken with the dawn; let your soul embrace mine and give me the kiss of hope; let no drops of sorrow or bitterness fall upon my body lest the flowers and grass refuse their nourishment. Do not shed tears of misery upon my hand, for they may grow thorns upon my grave. Do not draw lines of agony upon my forehead, for the wind may pass and read them and refuse to carry the dust of my bones to the green prairies…… I love you, my child, while I lived, and I shall love you when I am dead, and my soul shall always watch over you and protect you.”

Then Farris Effandi looked at me with his eyes half closed and said, “My son, be a real brother to Selma as your father was to me. Be her help and friend in need, and do not let her mourn, because mourning for the dead is a mistake. Repeat to her pleasant tales and sing for her the songs of life so that she may forget her sorrows. Remember me to your father; ask him to tell you the stories of your youth and tell him that I loved him in the person of his son in the last hour of my life.”

Silence prevailed, and I could see the pallor of death on the old man's face. Then he rolled his eyes and looked at us and whispered, “Don't call the physician, for he might extend my sentence in this prison by his medicine. The days of slavery are gone, and my soul seeks the freedom of the skies. And do not call the priest to my bedside, because his incantations would not save me if I were a sinner, nor would it rush me to Heaven if I were innocent. The will of humanity cannot change the will of God, as an astrologer cannot change the course of the stars. But after my death let the doctors and priest do what they please, for my ship will continue sailing until it reaches its destination.”

At midnight Farris Effandi opened his tired eyes for the last time and focused them on Selma, who was kneeling by his bedside. He tried to speak, but could not, for death had already choked his voice; but he finally managed to say, “The night has passed…… Oh, Selma……Oh……Oh, Selma……” Then he bent his head, his face turned white, and I could see a smile on his lips as he breathed his last.

Selma felt her father's hand. It was cold. Then she raised her head and looked at his face. It was covered with the veil of death. Selma was so choked that she could not shed tears, nor sigh, nor even move. For a moment she stared at him with fixed eyes like those of a statue; then she bent down until her forehead touched the floor, and said, “Oh, Lord, have mercy and mend our broken wings.”

Farris Effandi Karamy died; his soul was embraced by Eternity, and his body was returned to the earth. Mansour Bey Galib got possession of his wealth, and Selma became a prisoner of life—a life of grief and misery.

I was lost in sorrow and reverie. Days and nights preyed upon me as the eagle ravages its victim. Many a time I tried to forget my misfortune by occupying myself with books and scriptures of past generation, but it was like extinguishing fire with oil, for I could see nothing in the procession of the past but tragedy and could hear nothing but weeping and wailing. The Book of Job was more fascinating to me than the Psalms and I preferred the Elegies of Jeremiah to the Song of Solomon. Hamlet was closer to my heart than all other dramas of western writers. Thus despair weakens our sight and closes our ears. We can see nothing but specters of doom and can hear only the beating of our agitated hearts.





Between Christ and Ishtar


In the midst of the gardens and hills which connect the city of Beirut with Lebanon there is a small temple, very ancient, dug out of white rock, surrounded by olive, almond, and willow trees. Although this temple is a half mile from the main highway, at the time of my story very few people interested in relics and ancient ruins had visited it. It was one of many interesting places hidden and forgotten in Lebanon. Due to its seclusion, it had become a haven for worshippers and a shrine for lonely lovers.

As one enters this temple he sees on the wall at the east side an old Phoenician picture, carved in the rock depicting Ishtar, goddess of love and beauty, sitting on her throne, surrounded by seven nude virgins standing in different posses. The first one carries a torch; the second, a guitar; the third, a censer; the fourth a jug of wine; the fifth, a branch of roses; the sixth, a wreath of laurel; the seventh, a bow and arrow; and all of them look at Ishtar reverently.

On the second wall there is another picture, more modern than the first one, symbolizing Christ nailed to the cross, and at His side stand His sorrowful mother and Mary Magdalene and two other women weeping. This Byzantine picture shows that it was carved in the fifteenth or sixteenth century.

On the west side wall there are two round transits through which the sun's rays enter the temple and strike the pictures and make them look as if they were painted with gold water color. In the middle of the temple there is a square marble with old paintings on its sides, some of which can hardly be seen under the petrified lumps of blood which show that the ancient people offered sacrifices on this rock and poured perfume, wine, and oil upon it.

There is nothing else in that little temple except deep silence, revealing to the living the secrets of the goddess and speaking worldlessly of past generations and the evolution of religions. Such a sight carries the poet to a world far away from the one in which he dwells and convinces the philosopher that men were born religious; they felt a need for that which they could not see and drew symbols, the meaning of which divulged their hidden secrets and their desires in life and death.

In that unknown temple, I met Selma once every month and spent the hours with her, looking at those strange pictures, thinking of the crucified Christ and pondering upon the young Phoenician men and women who lived, loved and worshipped beauty in the person of Ishtar by burning incense before her statue and pouring perfume on her shrine, people for whom nothing is left to speak except the name, repeated by the march of time before the face of Eternity.

It is hard to write down in words the memories of those hours when I met Selma—those heavenly hours, filled with pain, happiness, sorrow, hope, and misery.

We met secretly in the old temple, remembering the old days, discussing our present, fearing our future, and gradually bringing out the hidden secrets in the depths of our hearts and complaining to each other of our misery and suffering, trying to console ourselves with imaginary hopes and sorrowful dreams. Every now and then we would become calm and wipe our tears and start smiling, forgetting everything except Love; we embraced each other until our hearts melted; then Selma would print a pure kiss on my forehead and fill my heart with ecstasy; I would return the kiss as she bent her ivory neck while her cheeks became gently red like the first ray of dawn on the forehead of hills. We silently looked at the distant horizon where the clouds were colored with the orange ray of sunset.

Our conversation was not limited to love; every now and then we drifted on to current topics and exchanged ideas. During the course of conversation Selma spoke of woman's place in society, the imprint that the past generation had left on her character, the relationship between husband and wife, and the spiritual diseases and corruption which threatened married life. I remember her saying： “The poets and writers are trying to understand the reality of woman, but up to this day they have not understood the hidden secrets of her heart, because they look upon her from behind the sexual veil and see nothing but externals; they look upon her through the magnifying glass of hatefulness and find nothing except weakness and submission.”

On another occasion she said, pointing to the carved pictures on the walls of the temple, “In the heart of this rock there are two symbols depicting the essence of a woman's desires and revealing the hidden secrets of her soul, moving between love and sorrow—between affection and sacrifice, between Ishtar sitting on the throne and Mary standing by the cross. The man buys glory and reputation, but the woman pays the price.”

No one knew about our secret meetings except God and the flock of birds which flew over the temple. Selma used to come in her carriage to a place named Pasha park and from there she walked to the temple, where she found me anxiously waiting for her.

We feared not the observer's eyes, neither did our consciences bother us; the spirit which is purified by fire and washed by tears is higher than what the people call shame and disgrace; it is free from the laws of slavery and old customs against the affections of the human heart. That spirit can proudly stand unashamed before the throne of God.

Human society has yielded for seventy centuries to corrupted laws until it cannot understand the meaning of the superior and eternal laws. A man's eyes have become accustomed to the dim light of candles and cannot see the sunlight. Spiritual disease is inherited from one generation to another until it has become a part of people, who look upon it, not as a disease, but as a natural gift, showered by God upon Adam. If those people found someone free from the germs of this disease, they would think of him with shame and disgrace.

Those who think evil of Selma Karamy because she left her husband's home and met me in the temple are the diseased and weak-minded kind who look upon the healthy and sound as rebels. They are like insects crawling in the dark for fear of being stepped upon by the passerby.

The oppressed prisoner, who can break away from his jail and does not do so, is a coward. Selma, an innocent and oppressed prisoner, was unable to free herself from slavery. Was she to blame because she looked through the jail window upon the green fields and spacious sky? Will the people count her as being untruthful to her husband because she came from his home to sit by me between Christ and Ishtar? Let the people say what they please; Selma had passed the marshes which submerge other spirits and had landed in a world that could not be reached by the howling of wolves and rattling of snakes. People may say what they want about me, for the spirit who has seen the specter of death cannot be scared by the faces of thieves; the soldier who has seen the swords glittering over his head and streams of blood under his feet does not care about rocks thrown at him by the children on the streets.





Sacrifice


One day in the late part of June, as the people left the city for the mountain to avoid the heat of summer, I went as usual to the temple to meet Selma, carrying with me a little book of Andalusian poems. As I reached the temple I sat there waiting for Selma, glancing at intervals at the pages of my book, reciting those verses which filled my heart with ecstasy and brought to my soul the memory of the kings, poets, and knights who bade farewell to Granada, and left, with tears in their eyes and sorrow in their hearts, their palaces, institutions and hopes behind. In an hour I saw Selma walking in the midst of the gardens and I approaching the temple, leaning on her parasol as if she were carrying all the worries of the world upon her shoulders. As she entered the temple and sat by me, I noticed some sort of change in her eyes and I was anxious to inquire about it.

Selma felt what was going on in my mind, and she put her hand on my head and said, “Come close to me, come my beloved, come and let me quench my thirst, for the hour of separation has come.”

I asked her, “Did your husband find out about our meeting her?” She responded, “My husband does not care about me, neither does he know how I spend my time, for he is busy with those poor girls whom poverty has driven into the houses of ill fame; those girls who sell their bodies for bread, kneaded with blood and tears.”

I inquired, “What prevents you from coming to this temple and sitting by me reverently before God? Is your soul requesting our separation?”

She answered with tears in her eyes, “No, my beloved, my spirit did not ask for separation, for you are a part of me. My eyes never get tired of looking at you, for you are their light; but if destiny ruled that I should walk the rough path of life loaded with shackles, would I be satisfied if your fate should be like mine?” Then she added, “I cannot say everything, because the tongue is mute with pain and cannot talk; the lips are sealed with misery and cannot move; all I can say to you is that I am afraid you may fall in the same trap I fell in.”

When I asked, “What do you mean, Selma, and of whom are you afraid?” She covered her face with her hands and said, “The Bishop has already found out that once a month I have been leaving the grave which he buried me in.”

I inquired, “Did the Bishop find out about our meetings here?” She answered, “If he did, you would not see me here sitting by you, but he is getting suspicious and he informed all his servants and guards to watch me closely. I am feeling that the house I live in and the path I walk on are all eyes watching me, and fingers pointing at me, and ears listening to the whisper of my thoughts.”

She was silent for a while, and then she added, with tears pouring down her cheeks, “I am not afraid of the Bishop, for wetness does not scare the drowned, but I am afraid you might fall into the trap and become his prey; you are still young and free as the sunlight. I am not frightened of fate which has shot all its arrows in my breast, but I am afraid the serpent might bite your feet and detain you from climbing the mountain peak where the future awaits you with its pleasure and glory.”

I said, “He who has not been bitten by the serpents of light and snapped at by the wolves of darkness will always be deceived by the days and nights. But listen, Selma, listen carefully; is separation the only means of avoiding people's evils and meanness? Has the path of love and freedom been closed and is nothing left except submission to the will of the slaves of death?”

She responded, “Nothing is left save separation and bidding each other farewell.”

With rebellious spirit I took her hand and said excitedly, “We have yielded to the people's will for a long time; since the time we met until this hour we have been led by the blind and have worshipped with them before their idols. Since the time I met you we have been in the hands of the Bishop like two balls which he has thrown around as he pleased. Are we going to submit to his will until death takes us away? Did God give us the breath of life to place it under death's feet? Did He give us liberty to make it a shadow of slavery? He who extinguishes his spirit's fire with his own hands is an infidel in the eyes of Heaven, for Heaven set the fire that burns in our spirits. He who does not rebel against oppression is doing himself injustice. I love you, Selma, and you love me, too; and Love is a precious treasure, it is God's gift to sensitive and great spirits. Shall we throw this treasure away and let the pigs scatter it and trample on it? This world is full of wonder and beauty. Why are we living in this narrow tunnel which the Bishop and his assistants have dug out for us? Life is full of happiness and freedom; why don't we take this heavy yoke off our shoulders and break the chains tied to our feet, and walk freely toward peace? Get up and let us leave this small temple for God's great temple. Let us leave this country and all its slavery and ignorance for another country far away and unreached by the hands of the thieves. Let us go to the coast under the cover of night and catch a boat that will take us across the oceans, where we can find a new life full of happiness and understanding. Do not hesitate, Selma for these minutes are more precious to us than the crowns of kings and more sublime than the thrones of angels. Let us follow the column of light that leads us from this arid desert into the green fields where flowers and aromatic plants grow.”

She shook her head and gazed at something invisible on the ceiling of the temple; a sorrowful smile appeared on her lips; then she said, “No, no my beloved. Heaven placed in my hand a cup, full of vinegar and gall; I forced myself to drink it in order to know the full bitterness at the bottom until nothing was left save a few drops, which I shall drink patiently. I am not worthy of a new life of love and peace; I am not strong enough for life's pleasure and sweetness, because a bird with broken wings cannot fly in the spacious sky. The eyes that are accustomed to the dim light of a candle are not strong enough to stare at the sun. Do not talk to me of happiness; its memory makes me suffer. Mention not peace to me; its shadow frightens me; but look at me and I will show you the holy torch which Heaven has lighted in the ashes of my heart—you know that I love you as a mother loves her only child, and Love only taught me to protect you even from myself. It is Love, purified with fire, that stops me from following you to the farthest land. Love kills my desires so that you may live freely and virtuously. Limited love asks for possession of the beloved, but the unlimited asks only for itself. Love that comes between the naivete and awakening of youth satisfies itself with possessing, and grows with embraces. But Love which is born in the firmament's lap and has descended with the night's secrets is not contended with anything but Eternity and immortality; it does not stand reverently before anything except deity.

“When I knew that the Bishop wanted to stop me from leaving his nephew's house and to take my only pleasure away from me, I stood before the window of my room and looked toward the sea, thinking of the vast countries beyond it and the real freedom and personal independence which can be found there. I felt that I was living close to you, surrounded by the shadow of your spirit, submerged in the ocean of your affection. But all these thoughts which illuminate a woman's heart and make her rebel against old customs and live in the shadow of freedom and justice, made me believe that I am weak and that our love is limited and feeble, unable to stand before the sun's face. I cried like a king whose kingdom and treasure have been usurped, but immediately I saw your face through my tears and your eyes gazing at me and I remembered what you said to me once (Come, Selma, come and let us be strong towers before the tempest. Let us stand like brave soldiers before the enemy and face his weapons. If we are killed, we shall die as martyrs; and if we win, we shall live as heroes. Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility. ) These words, my beloved, you uttered when the wings of death were hovering around my father's bed; I remembered them yesterday when the wings of despair were hovering above my head. I strengthened myself and felt, while in the darkness of my prison, some sort of precious freedom easing our difficulties and diminishing our sorrows. I found out that our love was as deep as the ocean and as high as the stars and as spacious as the sky. I came here to see you, and in my weak spirit there is a new strength, and this strength is the ability to sacrifice a great thing in order to obtain a greater one; it is the sacrifice of my happiness so that you may remain virtuous and honorable in the eyes of the people and be far away from their treachery and persecution.

“In the past, when I came to this place I felt as if heavy chains were pulling down on me, but today I came here with a new determination that laughs at the shackles and shortens the way. I used to come to this temple like a scared phantom, but today I came like a brave woman who feels the urgency of sacrifice and knows the value of suffering, a woman who likes to protect the one she loves from the ignorant people and from her hungry spirit. I used to sit by you like a trembling shadow, but today I came here to show you my true self before Ishtar and Christ.

“I am a tree, grown in the shade, and today I stretched my branches to tremble for a while in the daylight. I came here to tell you good-bye, my beloved, and it is my hope that our farewell will be great and awful like our love. Let our farewell be like fire that bends the gold and makes it more resplendent.”

Selma did not allow me to speak or protest, but she looked at me, her eyes glittering, her face retaining its dignity, seeming like an angel worthy of silence and respect. Then she flung herself upon me, something which she had never done before, and put her smooth arms around me and printed a long, deep, fiery kiss on my lips.




As the sun went down, withdrawing its rays from those gardens and orchards, Selma moved to the middle of the temple and gazed along at its walls and corners as if she wanted to pour the light of her eyes on its pictures and symbols. Then she walked forward and reverently knelt before the picture of Christ and kissed His feet, and she whispered, “Oh, Christ, I have chosen Thy Cross and deserted Ishtar's world of pleasure and happiness; I have worn the wreath of thorns and discarded the wreath of laurel and washed myself with blood and tears instead of perfume and scent; I have drunk vinegar and gall from a cup which was meant for wine and nectar; accept me, my Lord, among Thy followers and lead me toward Galilee with those who have chosen Thee, contended with their sufferings and delighted with their sorrows.”

Then she rose and looked at me and said, “Now I shall return happily to my dark cave, where horrible ghosts reside, Do not sympathize with me, my beloved, and do not feel sorry for me, because the soul that sees the shadow of God once will never be frightened, thereafter, of the ghosts of devils. And the eye that looks on heaven once will not be closed by the pains of the world.”

Uttering these words, Selma left the place of worship; and I remained there lost in a deep sea of thoughts, absorbed in the world of revelation where God sits on the throne and the angels write down the acts of human beings, and the souls recite the tragedy of life, and the brides of Heaven sing the hymns of love, sorrow and immortality.

Light had already come when I awakened from my swoon and found myself bewildered in the midst of the gardens, repeating the echo of every word uttered by Selma and remembering her silence, her actions, her movements, her expression and the touch of her hands, until I realized the meaning of farewell and the pain of lonesomeness. I was depressed and heart-broken. It was my first discovery of the fact that men, even if they are born free, will remain slaves of strict laws enacted by their forefathers; and that the firmament, which we imagine as unchanging, is the yielding of today to the will of tomorrow and submission of yesterday to the will of today. —Many a time, since the night, I have thought of the spiritual law which made Selma prefer death to life, and many a time I have made a comparison between nobility of sacrifice and happiness of rebellion to find out which one is nobler and more beautiful; but until now I have distilled only one truth out of the whole matter, and this truth is sincerity, which makes all our deeds beautiful and honorable. And this sincerity was in Selma Karamy.





The Rescuer


Five years of Selma's marriage passed without bringing children to strengthen the ties of spiritual relation between her and her husband and bind their repugnant souls together.

A barren woman is looked upon with disdain everywhere because of most men's desire to perpetuate themselves through posterity.

The substantial man considers his childless wife as an enemy; he detests her and deserts her and wishes her death. Mansour Bey Galib was that kind of man; materially, he was like earth, and hard like steel and greedy like a grave. His desire of having a child to carry on his name and reputation made him hate Selma in spite of her beauty and sweetness.

A tree grown in a cave does not bear fruit; and Selma, who lived in the shade of life, did not bear children……

The nightingale does not make his nest in a cage lest slavery be the lot of its chicks…… Selma was a prisoner of misery and it was Heaven's will that she would not have another prisoner to share her life. The flowers of the field are the children of sun's affection and nature's love; and the children of men are the flowers of love and compassion……

The spirit of love and compassion never dominated Selma's beautiful home at Ras Beyrouth; nevertheless, she knelt down on her knees every night before Heaven and asked God for a child in whom she would find comfort and consolation…… She prayed successively until Heaven answered her prayers……

The tree of the cave blossomed to bear fruit at last. The nightingale in the cage commenced making its nest with the feathers of its wings.

Selma stretched her chained arms toward Heaven to receive God's precious gift and nothing in the world could have made her happier than becoming a potential mother.

She waited anxiously, counting the days and looking forward to the time when Heaven's sweetest melody, the voice of her child, should ring in her ears……

She commenced to see the dawn of a brighter future through her tears.

It was the month of Nisan when Selma was stretched on the bed of pain and labor, where life and death were wrestling. The doctor and the midwife were ready to deliver to the world a new guest. Late at night Selma started her successive cry…… a cry of life's partition from life…… a cry of continuance in the firmament of nothingness…… a cry of a weak force before the stillness of great forces…… the cry of poor Selma who was lying down in despair under the feet of life and death.

At dawn Selma gave birth to a baby boy. When she opened her eyes she saw smiling faces all over the room, then she looked again and saw life and death still wrestling by her bed. She closed her eyes and cried, saying for the first time, “Oh, my son.” The midwife wrapped the infant with silk swaddles and placed him by his mother, but the doctor kept looking at Selma and sorrowfully shaking his head.

The voices of joy woke the neighbors, who rushed into the house to felicitate the father upon the birth of his heir, but the doctor still gazed at Selma and her infant and shook his head……

The servants hurried to spread the good news to Mansour Bey, but the doctor stared at Selma and her child with a disappointed look on his face.

As the sun came out, Selma took the infant to her breast; he opened his eyes for the first time and looked at his mother; then he quivered and closed them for the last time. The doctor took the child from Selma's arms and on his cheeks fell tears; then he whispered to himself, “He is a departing guest.”

The child passed away while the neighbors were celebrating with the father in the big hall at the house and drinking to the health of their heir; and Selma looked at the doctor, and pleaded, “Give me my child and let me embrace him.”

Though the child was dead, the sounds of the drinking cups increased in the hall……

He was born at dawn and died at sunrise……

He was born like a thought and died like a sigh and disappeared like a shadow.

He did not live to console and comfort his mother.

His life began at the end of the night and ended at the beginning of the day, like a drop of few poured by the eyes of the dark and dried by the touch of the light.

A pearl brought by the tide to the coast and returned by the ebb into the depth of the sea……

A lily that has just blossomed from the bud of life and is mashed under the feet of death.

A dear guest whose appearance illuminated Selma's heart and whose departure killed her soul.

This is the life of men, the life of nations, the life of suns, moons and stars.

And Selma focused her eyes upon the doctor and cried, “Give me my child and let me embrace him; give me my child and let me nurse him.”

Then the doctor bent his head. His voice choked and he said, “Your child is dead, Madame, be patient.”

Upon hearing her doctor's announcement, Selma uttered a terrible cry. Then she was quiet for a moment and smiled happily. Her face brightened as if she had discovered something, and quietly she said, “Give me my child; bring him close to me and let me see him dead.”

The doctor carried the dead child to Selma and placed him between her arms. She embraced him, then turned her face toward the wall and addressed the dead infant saying, “You have come to take me away my child; you have come to show me the way that leads to the coast. Here I am my child; lead me and let us leave this dark cave.”

And in a minute the sun's ray penetrated the window curtains and fell upon two calm bodies lying on a bed, guarded by the profound dignity of silence and shaded by the wings of death. The doctor left the room with tears in his eyes, and as he reached the big hall the celebrations was converted into a funeral, but Mansour Bey Galib never uttered a word or shed a tear. He remained standing motionless like a statue, holding a drinking cup with his right hand.

The second day Selma was shrouded with her white wedding dress and laid in a coffin; the child's shroud was his swaddle; his coffin was his mother's arms; his grave was her calm breast. Two corpses were carried in one coffin, and I walked reverently with the crowd accompanying Selma and her infant to their resting place.

Arriving at the cemetery, Bishop Galib commenced chanting while the other priests prayed, and on their gloomy faces appeared a veil of ignorance and emptiness.

As the coffin went down, one of the bystanders whispered, “This is the first time in my life I have seen two corpses in one coffin.” Another one said, “It seems as if the child had come to rescue his mother from her pitiless husband.”

A third one said, “Look at Mansour Bey：he is gazing at the sky as if his eyes were made of glass. He does not look like he has lost his wife and child in one day.” A fourth one added, “His uncle, the Bishop, will marry him again tomorrow to a wealthier and stronger woman.”

The Bishop and the priests kept on singing and chanting until the gravedigger was through filing the ditch. Then, the people, individually, approached the Bishop and his nephew and offered their respects to them with sweet words of sympathy, but I stood lonely aside without a soul to console me, as if Selma and her child meant nothing to me.

The farewell-bidders left the cemetery; the gravedigger stood by the new grave holding a shovel with his hand.

As I approached him, I inquired, “Do you remember where Farris Effandi Karamy was buried?”

He looked at me for a moment, then pointed at Selma's grave and said, “Right here; I placed his daughter upon him and upon his daughter's breast rests her child, and upon all I put the earth back with this shovel.”

Then I said, “In this ditch you have also buried my heart.”

As the gravedigger disappeared behind the poplar trees, I could not resist anymore; I dropped down on Selma's grave and wept.
