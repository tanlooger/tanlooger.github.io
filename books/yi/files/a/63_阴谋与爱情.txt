席勒名剧《阴谋与爱情》及其在中国的接受

——代译序


杨武能





弗里德里希·席勒（Friedrich Schiller, 1759-1805）是德国文学史上与歌德齐名的大诗人、大剧作家和美学理论家。他最著名的诗作为经贝多芬谱曲后唱遍全世界的《欢乐颂》；此外他还有一些抒情诗、哲理诗和叙事谣曲，也受到后世广泛的重视。

但是，作为剧作家，席勒的成就更多、更大，在德语文学乃至世界文学史上的地位也更加显赫和重要。他创作的《强盗》《阴谋与爱情》《堂·卡洛斯》《华伦斯坦三部曲》《玛利亚·斯图亚特》《裴阿斯柯在热拉亚的谋反》《奥里昂的姑娘》和《威廉·退尔》等剧本，不仅至今仍脍炙人口，经常被搬上德国和世界的戏剧舞台，有的还多次拍成电影，而其中的《阴谋与爱情》又是最著名和最富影响的一部。

《阴谋与爱情》（1784）是席勒青年时期创作的主要代表作，堪称德国狂飙突进运动少数几个最硕大的成果之一，曾被恩格斯誉为“德国第一部有政治倾向的戏剧”。该故事发生于18世纪分裂、落后、名存实亡的所谓日耳曼民族的神圣罗马帝国，具体讲则是在德国境内数以百计的小邦之一的某一个公国。这个公国小则小矣，其在剧中所反映出的政治生态和社会风情的方方面面，于当时整个德国的现实却极具典型性，可以作为其封建、腐朽、愚昧的象征和代表。

该剧通过一对门第悬殊的年轻人由相恋而毁灭的悲惨故事，对荒淫无耻、阴险卑劣的封建统治者及其帮凶，做了无情的揭露和鞭笞。剧本情节紧凑、曲折，矛盾冲突环环相扣，然而演进、展开却自然合理；临近高潮时剧情紧张得叫人几乎透不过气来，但于紧张激烈之中又不乏抒情和诗意，阅读起来也与看舞台演出一样引人入胜。一些场次，如第二幕第二场老侍从给弥尔芙特夫人送去公爵以无数青年给外国充当炮灰为代价换来的珠宝，第四幕第七场露意丝与弥尔芙特夫人之间的尴尬会晤和唇枪舌剑，以及第五幕剧终前年轻的恋人双双为爱情付出了宝贵的生命等等，都可谓精彩之极，堪称德国古典戏剧不朽的经典。

剧中的人物全都刻画得十分成功：正面人物一个个除去其可爱之处，又令人信服地有着各自的弱点，如男主人公斐迪南侠肝义胆，对爱情无比忠诚，同时却嫉妒、多疑，其毒杀恋人的举动更不能不说是可怕的自私的表现[1]；女主人公露意丝天真无邪，心地纯善，同时却生性软弱而且迷信，结果给了坏人可乘之机；乐师米勒作为德国市民阶级的代表，虽不乏自爱、自尊，却惧怕官府，等等。在反面人物中，宰相封·瓦尔特寡廉鲜耻，残忍毒辣，无疑是一个古今中外都有的权奸典型，他为了获得更大的权势不择手段，甚至不惜牺牲自己儿子的终生幸福；宰相的秘书伍尔穆更可谓一肚子坏水，是个为虎作伥、阴险诡诈的地道小人，人间的悲剧往往由这种看似不足道的人引发，剧中的伍尔穆为此提供了生动的例证；侍卫长封·卡尔勃则是任何封建宫廷里都少不了的小丑，在剧中同样并非可有可无的点缀。还有一个看似次要的人物即公爵的情妇弥尔芙特夫人，其身份、遭遇、性格都既复杂又充满矛盾，在剧中地位尴尬而又关键，是一个十分值得注意和颇堪玩味的人物典型。

读《阴谋与爱情》，很容易想到莱辛和莎士比亚的一些著名悲剧，例如前者的《爱米丽雅·迦洛蒂》，后者的《罗密欧与朱丽叶》和《奥赛罗》等。不过比较起来，《阴谋与爱情》的政治和社会意义似乎更明显，批判的锋芒也更锐利、有力，也正因此，它才成为了“德国第一部有政治倾向的戏剧”。

综上所述，《阴谋与爱情》是席勒的一部杰作，不仅在德语文学史和世界戏剧史上占有突出而重要的地位，而且也少有的精彩和好看。

*

古典和近代的德语文学，其在我国流传最广、影响最大的长篇小说无疑是歌德的《少年维特的烦恼》，中篇小说则为施笃姆的《茵梦湖》，而剧本恐怕就数席勒的《阴谋与爱情》了，虽然以中文译本之多而论，它远远无法与已有十多二十种中译的《维特》与《茵梦湖》相比。包括眼前的拙译在内，《阴谋与爱情》迄今仅出版了三种译本，即还有1934年上海商务印书馆出版的张富岁译本，以及1955年北京人民文学出版社出版的廖辅叔译本。拙译曾于1993年收入我本人的三十年译文自选集《德语文学精品》（漓江出版社出版），后来还入选权威的《世界经典戏剧全集》（童道明主编，浙江文艺出版社出版），后来出单行本时做了相当多的修订和润色。不论在席勒本人的创作中，还是在整个德国戏剧文学中，《阴谋与爱情》都可称是一部最为中国读者和观众所熟知和喜爱的作品。

这一论断，可以从下面一些似乎不乏文化思想史意义的事件和事实中得到印证。

首先，在我国的三个不同历史时期，《阴谋与爱情》至少由三个不同的中国剧团公演过，这在席勒本人乃至整个德语的戏剧文学中，都是绝无仅有的。

最为人熟知和受人称道的一次演出在1959年，演出的剧团为北京著名的中国青年艺术剧院。那一年的11月，为了纪念席勒诞辰二百周年，我国首都文化界千余人举行盛大集会，出席纪念会的有文化部部长沈雁冰和首都文艺界的丁西林、老舍、田汉等知名人士，以及德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔等外交官员。被国外某些研究者称为“中国的席勒”[2]的田汉，在会上做了长篇报告，分析了包括《阴谋与爱情》在内的一系列席勒代表作。作为盛大纪念会的最后一个节目，中国青年艺术剧院首演了由周来执导的《阴谋与爱情》。会后，此剧又连演许多场，成了当时首都文化生活中的一件大事。

从报刊发表的一系列报道和评介文章看，这次为配合席勒诞辰纪念而带应景和急就章性质的演出很是成功，因此著名戏剧评论家李健吾发出感叹说：“看一出演得好的席勒的戏，还想克制沸腾着的热情，是需要功夫的。”[3]

但是，演出尽管成功，仍难免带上那年头奉为圭臬的文艺为政治——现实政治服务的鲜明印记，具有不可忽视的外交和政治意义。难怪评论在极力突出原剧的政治和阶级斗争含义之余，还要顺带批判一下西德的“反动势力”。

1959年青艺的演出，曾由电视台在一间仅两米见方的简陋演播室中直播了十五分钟；可以想见，观众面仍然很是狭窄。不过，话虽如此，对于席勒作品特别是《阴谋与爱情》一剧在中国的影响和接受来说，青艺的演出不能不说具有相当重要的意义。

《阴谋与爱情》的另一次演出，远远不像青艺的演出那么受人重视。从1959年的一两篇文章中得知，那是在“多年前”，即新中国成立前，而且“不怎么成功”。李健吾先生说：“首先，把首相改成警察局局长（记得是这样类似的身份），政治背景缩小了，愤恨的目标也就缩小了。阶级对立的情况被抹杀，故事落入一般贫富之间的婚姻纠葛。就当时来说，这样的改编是出于不得已……”[4]由此，我们不也可以窥知“多年前”那次演出的时代特色吗？

第三次也即最近的一次演出，在“文革”结束不久后的1979年。虽说那时文艺演出异常贫乏，它却并未为一般研究者和评论界所重视。原因也许在演出单位是没有太大名气的东北某省剧团。但是，这次笔者曾在北京通过电视转播观看的演出，在当年对于文艺与政治的关系格外敏感的中国观众看来，却有着超乎寻常的巨大现实意义。[5]人们自觉不自觉地把舞台上发生的事情和现实联系起来，目睹成为封建等级制度牺牲品的年轻主人公的悲剧，很自然地便想到现实生活中受反动血统论戕害的千百万青年男女的不幸遭遇，就把愤怒的目光和批判的矛头同样对准以搞阴谋为其特长的“四人帮”。所以，《阴谋与爱情》的第三次公演不论成功与否，也不论演出的剧团水准高低和评论界反应怎样，在我们研究《阴谋与爱情》的接受和影响时都不应该忽视。

其次，通过上述的三次公演，通过后两次公演时的电视转播和德发电影制片厂同名影片的反复放映，通过两三个文学译本和一册江浚、谭晓春编绘的同名连环画（天津人民美术出版社出版）的流传，《阴谋与爱情》的故事在中国可以说差不多家喻户晓，并在中国公众特别是在青年一代里产生了很大的影响。

可以举一个反映在文学作品中的具体例子。1982年，中国青年出版社出版了叶辛的《蹉跎岁月》。在这部曾经十分畅销并被改编成了同名电影的长篇小说中，有两个与《阴谋与爱情》关系密切的场面：





第一个场面


一天夜里，刚认识不久的男女主人公在庄稼地里值夜，他向她谈到了家庭出身不好给自己带来的苦恼；她想给他宣传党的政策，可是没起多大作用。随后，她关切地问：“哎，我来的时候，你在看什么书？我见你看书时眼里有泪光，这书一定很好看吧！”“是剧本，《阴谋与爱情》。”他掏出一本薄薄的小书说。“这样的书？”她有点意外。“是啊，德国人席勒作的。写一对出身、门第相当悬殊的青年男女的爱情悲剧。”他回答时“带着深深的感情”。可出身“红五类”的她呢，对这类“封、资、修”的书却不感兴趣：“一听名字就觉得不是好书，什么阴谋与爱情，肯定又是写哪个资本家的儿子爱上了一个贫穷的姑娘，不择手段耍弄阴谋想达到目的。听着都作呕。”[6]





第二个场面


三年后，她由于父亲被打成“走资派”而沦为“黑五类”，受到了坏人的迫害。一天卧病在床，为了排遣自己对他的相思，把从他手里借来的《阴谋与爱情》翻开来看。这时作者叶辛写道：





杜见春看了第一场戏，就被深深地吸引住了。她捧着书，听不到鸡啼狗吠，听不到走过集体户门外人的说话声，忘记了自己是个病人，一口气，把这本薄薄的小书读完了。尤其是最后那场戏，杜见春读着读着，不由自主地落下泪来，低声抽泣着。



看完书，她没有把最后那一页合上，呆痴痴地坐着，仰起脸来，两眼瞪得老大，凝视着光线晦暗的屋头。根本没察觉，时间已是午后，也根本不觉得肚子饿。[7]





这两个场面很是感人。它们有力而具体地说明，中国青年——包括出身经历不同的现代青年——是怎样理解和接受席勒的悲剧杰作《阴谋与爱情》的。

至此，自然会提出一个问题：为什么这部在两百年前产生于德国诗人笔下的剧本，能获得中国文艺界和中国观众包括现代青年的理解和喜爱，产生如此深远的影响呢？

原因应该说不止一个，除了原著本身巨大的文学魅力，除了中文译本、中国青年艺术剧院等的演出以及德发电影制片厂的影片都相当成功，还须提及的是中国也有许多类似题材的传统文学作品，因而群众接受起来没有任何困难。但是最重要和最根本的原因，仍在于剧本那反对封建等级制度和门阀观念、争取恋爱自由和个性解放的题材和主题思想。具有这类题材和主题的优秀作品，一般较易超越时代和地域的限制，因为它们表达了人类共同的理想和追求，而对于刚刚脱离“四人帮”封建法西斯桎梏的中国，人们的这一理想和追求又更加强烈。在中国封建社会持续的时间特别长，反封建的民主革命很不彻底，千百年来直至“文革”时期在现实生活中不知演出了多少阴谋与爱情的悲剧。也就难怪，《阴谋与爱情》这部杰作能为我们的读者和观众很快地理解、接受。出于同样的原因，《少年维特的烦恼》和《茵梦湖》则成了在中国流传最广、影响最大的德语古典长篇小说和中篇小说。这样一类的文学接受现象，应该讲绝非偶然或巧合，而是读者集体心理意识的曲折流露和群众理想追求的隐蔽反映。也就是说，从读者的接受和反应不只可以判断作品优劣，而且能窥知一定的社会现实。这，似乎也证明了文学接受与影响研究的意义和价值。

第一幕





第一场


乐师家里的一房间。



米勒正从圈椅里站起来，把大提琴靠在一旁。米勒太太坐桌旁喝咖啡，还穿着睡衣。





米勒　（很快地踱来踱去）事情就这么定了。情况正变得严重起来。我的女儿和男爵少爷已成为众人的话柄。我的家已遭人笑骂。宰相会得到风声的——一句话，我不准那位贵公子再进咱家的门。

米勒太太　又不是你求他上你这儿来的——又不是你把闺女硬塞进了他怀里！

米勒　我是没有求他上咱家来——我是没有把闺女硬塞给他；可谁会计较这些呢？——身为一家之主，我本该更严厉地管教自己的女儿，本该更好地提防那位少校——或者立刻去见他的父亲大人，把事情原原本本报告给他。男爵少爷最终会闹出乱子来的，这我无论如何都该知道，而一切罪责将通通落在我这个提琴师的头上。

米勒太太　（将咖啡喝得一点不剩）笑话！胡扯！什么会落在你头上？谁又能把你怎么着？你仍然干你的老行道，仍然招收学生，只要什么地方还有招的。

米勒　可是，你告诉我，这整个买卖结果又会怎样？——他不可能娶咱闺女——根本谈不上娶不娶的问题；而做他的一个——上帝怜悯！——得啦得啦！——就说有这么位贵公子，东游西荡地鬼知道已经尝试过多少美酒，眼下自然也会有胃口来饮一点清水。当心！当心！即使你对每一只夜蛾子都保持警惕，他也会在你鼻尖儿底下把你的闺女骗走，叫她吃亏上当，自己却溜之大吉。姑娘呢，便一辈子身败名裂，要么待在家里嫁不出去，要么就继续操那可恶的营生。（用拳头击打自己额头）耶稣基督啊！

米勒太太　愿上帝发发慈悲，保佑我们！

米勒　是需要上帝保佑。那么个花花公子还会安什么心！——姑娘生得漂亮——苗条——步履轻盈。至于脑顶下边有没有脑子，就无所谓了。一般人都不管你们妇女脑子怎样，只有亲爱的上帝才没有忽视最根本的东西——一当那轻浮少年把这方面的底细摸透了——嗨，瞧吧！他马上就会像我的罗德尼[1]嗅到了法国人似的心花怒放，立刻会挂起满帆，大胆发动攻击，不——不是我把他想得很坏。人总是人。这我不会不知道。

米勒太太　可你也该读读男爵少爷写给你女儿的那些信。上帝啊，真是甜蜜美极啦！他倾心的纯粹是她美好的心灵。

米勒　唯其如此，更加糟糕！为了驱赶驴子，却鞭打袋子。要想向可爱的肉体致意，只得让美好的心灵当信使。我当初是怎么来着？只要先规规矩矩，做到心心相印！等火候一到，肉体便会呼啦一下，跟着也姘在一起！奴仆总是学老爷的样儿；银色的月亮说到底不过是个皮条匠。

米勒太太　你还是先看看少校先生拿到咱们家来的那些精美的书吧。你的女儿常常用它们做祷告哩。

米勒　（吹了一下口哨）呸！祷告！你那吃惯了杏仁饼的肠胃太娇嫩，消受不了这自然的生炖牛肉汤——他必须让它在无聊文人的黑死病魔厨里再煨一煨。快将那些废物扔进火里去！我闺女天知道满脑袋都吸收了些什么荒谬绝伦的东西！它们将渗进她的血液，就像西班牙的蚊虫，把我这父亲勉勉强强还维系着的一点点基督精神也给冲散。扔进火里去，我说！那丫头会满脑袋魔鬼念头，会听信那些懒人乐园中的胡说八道，结果再也找不到回家的路，忘记了她父亲米勒是一个提琴师，以有我这样的父亲为耻。到头来，她将使我失去一个能干诚实的女婿，一个热心关照我的女婿……不！上帝惩罚我！（气急败坏地跳起来）一不做，二不休，我要叫那少校——是的是的，叫那少校明白，咱家不欢迎他这个客人。（准备出门去）

米勒太太　别胡来，米勒！光他送的礼物就值多少钱啊……

米勒　（走回来站在她面前）我女儿的卖身钱，是吗？——你给我见鬼去吧，不要脸的老鸨！——我宁肯带着我的提琴沿街乞讨，为换取一盆热汤而演奏；宁肯砸碎我的大提琴，把大粪灌进共鸣箱中，也不愿靠我独生女儿拿灵魂和幸福换来的钱养活——别再喝你那该死的咖啡，吸你那该死的鼻烟！这样，你就用不着到市集上去出卖你女儿的脸蛋。在那可恶的浑蛋闯进咱们家之前，我同样吃得饱饱的，穿得暖暖的。

米勒太太　只是别操之过急，莽莽撞撞。瞧你眼下真叫火冒三丈！我不过说，别去得罪少校先生，人家到底是宰相的公子。

米勒　问题就在这儿。正因此事情才必须在今天就解决。宰相一定会感谢我，要是他是位好父亲。快给我把红绒外套刷一刷，我要去谒见宰相大人。我要对大人说：您的公子看上了我的女儿，可小女不配做您的公子的妻子；然而她又不能做公子的婊子，因为她是我的心肝宝贝！事情到此结束——在下的名字叫米勒。

第二场


伍尔穆秘书，前场人物。





米勒太太　哟，早上好，秘书先生。非常高兴又见到您！

伍尔穆　我也一样，我也一样，嫂夫人。哪儿有了贵人的眷顾，那儿就再也瞧不上咱这样的小市民啰。

米勒太太　哪儿的话，秘书先生！少校斐迪南的光临固然给了我们脸面，可我们也并不因此瞧不起任何人啊。

米勒　（厌烦地）给先生搬椅子来，老婆子！要宽宽衣吗，老乡？

伍尔穆　（放下帽子和手杖，坐下来）好的！好的！她怎么样，我未来的——或者说过去的人儿？——我可不希望——我不能见见她——见见露意丝小姐吗？

米勒太太　多谢您问起她，我的女儿可是一点儿都不高傲。

米勒　（生气地用胳膊撞自己的妻子）老婆！

米勒太太　遗憾的只是，她没有见到秘书先生您的荣幸。她正好赶弥撒去了，我的女儿。

伍尔穆　我很高兴，我很高兴。她有朝一日会成为我笃信基督的好太太。

米勒太太　（愚蠢而傲慢地一笑）是啰是啰——不过呢，秘书先生——

米勒　（显然十分尴尬，拧了拧妻子的耳朵）你！

米勒太太　可是——正如秘书先生您将亲眼见到的……

米勒　（极其生气地撞了老婆的臀部一下）蠢婆娘！

米勒太太　好就是好，更好就是更好；对自己的独生闺女，谁又会挡她的道，不让她获得幸福呢？（愚蠢而骄傲地）但愿您将来别记恨我才好，秘书先生！

伍尔穆　（不安地在圈椅里扭来扭去，一会儿搔搔耳朵，一会儿扯扯衬衫袖头和胸前的褶襞）记恨？哪儿的话？——对了——您到底是什么意思？

米勒太太　喽——喽——我只是想——我是说，（咳嗽了两声）亲爱的上帝偏偏要让咱闺女成为一位贵夫人，所以您……

伍尔穆　（从圈椅中一跃而起）您在说什么？什么？

米勒　请坐下，请别激动，秘书先生。这婆娘是头蠢猪。哪儿会有什么贵夫人？胡说八道，愚蠢透顶！

米勒太太　你爱怎么骂怎么骂吧。我知道的，反正知道；而少校先生说过的话，反正已经说过。

米勒　（气急败坏，奔过去抓他的提琴）看你还不住嘴？是想我拿琴揍你脑袋不成？——你能知道什么？他能说什么？别信她胡扯，秘书先生——滚，回你的厨房去！——别当我是个大傻瓜，以为我会指望着靠女儿出人头地！您不会这样想我，对吧，秘书先生？

伍尔穆　我也没资格品评您，乐师先生。您在我眼中始终是个讲信誉的人，而我对令爱提出的请求也是完全算数的。我有一份足以养家糊口的差事；宰相挺器重我；如果我想升迁，是不会缺少举荐的。您看见了，我对露意丝小姐诚心诚意，要是她不让一个纨绔公子搞得晕头转向……

米勒太太　伍尔穆秘书先生！我想请您尊重……

米勒　你给我住嘴，我说！——请别介意，秘书先生。还是老样子，去年秋天我对您说过的话，今儿个我可以重复一遍。不过我不想强迫我的女儿。去亲近她吧，好好儿地——让她看出和您在一起会得到幸福。要是她摇头——那更好——以主的名义我想说——要那样，您只好认了，只好来和她的父亲喝上几杯——不得不和您一起过日子的是姑娘——不是我——干吗我要固执己见，硬把一个不合她口味的男人塞给她，成为她的累赘呢？——这么做了，我在自己垂暮之年将没脸见人，将坐卧不安，饮食无味，仿佛时时刻刻都有人在骂我：你这个坏蛋，是你毁了自己的孩子！

米勒太太　废话少说——我绝对不会同意；咱闺女生就的富贵命；要是我丈夫让人说昏了头，我就找法院去。

米勒　贫嘴婆娘，看我不捶断你的腿！

伍尔穆　（对乐师夫妇）在女儿眼中，父亲的意见非常重要，但愿您会了解我，米勒先生！

米勒　倒了邪霉！必须了解您的是姑娘。我这个吹毛求疵的老头子看得起的，恰恰不会对年轻的馋嘴小妞的口味。我能够准确无误地告诉您，你是否适合当一名乐队队员——可即使对一位乐队指挥来说，女人家的心眼儿也太尖太细。而且实话实说，老乡——咱是个粗鲁的直肠子德国人——我的意见到头来很难得到您的感谢。我不会劝我女儿嫁给任何人——我却要劝她别嫁给您，秘书先生。请让我说完。一个缠着女方父亲帮忙的求婚者——请允许我说——我不相信会有任何出息。否则，他就会羞于走这种老路，而径直去向自己心上人表白的。他要是没有勇气这样做，那就是一个胆小鬼；而一个胆小鬼就甭想得到什么露意丝！——是的，他必须背着父亲去追求女儿。他必须使得姑娘心甘情愿让父母见鬼去也不肯失去他——或者使她自己跑来跪在父亲膝下，苦苦哀求父亲：要么让她服毒自杀，要么同意她嫁给自己唯一的心上人——这样，我才称他是好样儿的！这才叫作爱情！——谁要不能叫女人痴心到这个程度，谁就只好——抱着鹅毛管打盹儿去。

伍尔穆　（拿起帽子和手杖，走出房门）多谢了，米勒先生。

米勒　（慢慢跟着他）谢什么呢？谢什么呢？您可是一点儿便宜没得着啊，秘书先生。（回到房中）他什么也没听明白，他走了——可我一见这个耍笔杆的家伙，就像吞了毒药和砒霜似的浑身不自在。他是那样阴阳怪气，令人厌恶，活像是某个走私客从地狱里偷带进上帝的世界里来的——一双细眯眯、贼溜溜的老鼠眼——头发火红火红——腮帮子向前伸得老长，就像造物主出了一件废品，一生气将这个坏蛋扔到世界的某个角落里来了似的——不！要我把女儿送给这样一个恶棍，我宁肯让她——上帝饶恕我……

米勒太太　（恶狠狠地啐了一口唾沫）这条狗！——不过呢，你也别在那儿不干不净地骂啦。

米勒　还有你，也别再对我提你那瘟神少爷——刚才你已叫我气得要死——本该你，上帝保佑，机灵一点的时候你却格外愚蠢。胡扯一通贵夫人啊，你的女儿啊，究竟有什么意思？他在我看来是头狐狸。你只要对他提提这种事，保管明天就会传得满城风雨。他正是这么个成天走东家串西家、对什么都说长道短的角色，你一不小心漏出一句怪话——得！马上公爵、公爵夫人和宰相全知道啦，叫你吃不了兜着走。





第三场


露意丝·米勒上，手里捧着一本书。前场人物。





露意丝　（放下书，走到乐师面前，握着他的手）早上好，亲爱的爸爸。

米勒　（亲热地）乖，我的露意丝——我很高兴，你经常想着创造你的主。坚持下去吧，他会扶助你的。

露意丝　呵，我是个罪孽深重的女子，爸爸。他来过了吗，妈妈？

米勒太太　谁呀，孩子？

露意丝　唉！我忘了除去他还有别人——我的脑子全乱了——他没来过吗，瓦尔特？

米勒　（伤心而严肃地）我原以为，我的露意丝已经把这个姓氏遗忘在教堂里了！

露意丝　（呆呆地望着他好一会儿，然后说）我理解你，爸爸——感觉得到你戳进我良心的那把刀子；可是已经晚了——我再也不能专心地祷告，爸爸——上天和斐迪南从两边撕扯我流血的灵魂，我害怕呀——我害怕——（停了一停）可是不，我的好爸爸。如果我们由于欣赏一幅画而忽视了画家，那他定会觉得是对他的最高赞美——现在我因为喜爱上帝的杰作而忽视了上帝本身，爸爸你说，难道不同样令他高兴吗？

米勒　（不快地一屁股坐进圈椅）瞧吧，瞧吧！这就是读那些不敬上帝的书的结果。

露意丝　（不快地走向窗口）他这会儿会在哪里呢？看着他——听着他谈话的，都是些高贵的小姐。而我，一个贫贱的女孩，被他遗忘了。（说到这儿吓了一跳，赶紧奔向她父亲）可是不！不！原谅我！我不为自己的命运哭泣。我只是愿意有时——想一想他——这不用付出任何代价。我的卑微的生命——我想把它变作一缕宜人的清风，吹送到他脸上，使他感到凉爽！——我这青春的小花儿——就算小得如一朵紫罗兰，我也希望他踩上去，我愿卑微地在他的脚下死掉！这样我已经满足了，爸爸。高傲、威严的太阳是不会惩罚蚊虫的，如果它仅仅是在阳光中获取温暖！

米勒　（感动地俯身在圈椅扶手上，手蒙着面孔）听我说，露意丝——我的这点残余的岁月，我真愿意将它舍去啊，要是你从来不曾见过那个少校。

露意丝　（惊恐地）他说什么？他说什么？——不！他不是这个意思，我的好爸爸。他不会知道，斐迪南是我的，生来就是我的，是慈爱的天父为了使我快乐而创造的。（伫立沉思）当我第一次见到他——（加快语速）热血便涌上我的脸颊，我的所有血管都流动得更加欢畅，每一次脉搏都在说，每一下呼吸都在低语：是他，就是他！——我的心也认出了它渴慕已久的人，向我证实道，就是他！而周围的整个世界似乎都在同声欢呼和共鸣。那一瞬——呵，那一瞬我的灵魂中出现了第一个清晨。千万种青春的情感从心里涌出，像春来时大地百花怒放。世界从我眼前消失了，可我却意识到，世界从来没有像现在这样美好。我不知道还有上帝，可却从来没有像现在这样热爱上帝。

米勒　（奔向露意丝，把她抱在胸前）露意丝——宝贝儿——好孩子——把我这老朽的头颅拿去吧——把我的一切——一切一切全拿去吧！——可那位少校——上帝做证——我永远不能给你！（下）

露意丝　我现在也不指望得到他呵，父亲。我的生命有如一滴朝露——一个关于斐迪南的梦想就已将它饮尽。今生今世我甘愿失去他。可是将来，妈妈——将来啊，当等级差别的篱笆垮掉以后——当出身微贱的皮壳从我们身上剥落以后——人又纯粹是人——我除去自己的纯洁清白之外一无所有，可父亲不是经常讲嘛，当上帝到来之时，金银首饰和显贵头衔将一钱不值，而心却会受到珍视。那时候，我将变得十分富有。那时候，眼泪将成为胜利的标志，美好的思想将取代高贵的门第。那时候，我也变得高贵了，妈妈——那时候，他还有什么高过他的姑娘之处呢？

米勒太太　（急匆匆站起身）露意丝！少校来啦！他跳过了篱笆！叫我藏到哪儿才好哟！

露意丝　（开始战栗起来）别，妈妈。你留下。

米勒太太　我的上帝！瞧我这副模样！我一定会羞死的。我不能在少爷面前丢人现眼。（下）





第四场


斐迪南·封·瓦尔特和露意丝。



（他飞跑向她——她面色苍白地瘫倒在圈椅上——他站在她面前——他与她四目相对，默默无言地过了一会儿。）





斐迪南　你脸色怎么这样苍白，露意丝？

露意丝　（站起来，扑进他怀里，搂住他的脖子）没什么。没什么。你来了一切都好了。

斐迪南　（捧起她的手亲吻）可我的露意丝还爱我吗？我的心仍然和昨天一样。你的心也是这样的吗？我迫不及待地跑来，只是想看看你是不是高兴，然后也高高兴兴地离开——可你并不高兴！

露意丝　不，不，亲爱的。

斐迪南　我的双眼告诉我，你真的不高兴。我能像看透这颗清亮如水的钻石一般看透你的心。（指了指手上的戒指）这里没有任何一点小气泡我看不见——你脸上流露出来的任何心事，同样逃不过我的眼睛。你怎么啦，快告诉我！我只要看见你这面镜子没有尘埃，整个世界对于我便晴空万里。到底什么事叫你烦恼啊？

露意丝　（默默地、意味深长地注视了他一会儿，然后伤感地）斐迪南啊斐迪南！要是你也理解，在我们的语言中，所谓市民少女含义多么奇妙……

斐迪南　什么意思？（迷惑不解）姑娘！听我说！你怎么想到这个！——你是我的露意丝。谁告诉你说，你还是别的什么来着？你看看，你这虚情假意的人儿，你竟这样地给我泼冷水！要是你全心全意地爱我，哪来时间去琢磨那些事？我呢，一到你身旁，整个理智都融化成了对你的注视，一离开你又化作对你的梦想——可你在爱我的同时还能头脑清醒？——你真该害羞！你为那些想法而苦闷的一分一秒，都是对你年轻爱人的剥夺和背叛！

露意丝　（抓住他的手，摇着头）你想诳我，斐迪南——你想把我的目光从我必定会掉下去的深渊边沿引开。我看见了我的未来——荣誉的呼唤——你的前程——你的父亲——我的一无所有。（惊恐地，将他的手丢开）斐迪南！你我头顶上悬着一把剑！——他们一定会拆散咱们俩！

斐迪南　（跳起身来）拆散我俩！你从哪儿来的这种预感，露意丝？拆散我俩！——谁有能耐拆散两颗联结在一起的心？拆散两根琴弦发出的共鸣？——我是一个贵族——可咱们倒要看一看，我的封爵文书是否比天长比地久？我的贵族族徽是否比露意丝眼里的纹章更加有力量？这纹章表示的是：这个女子注定属于这个男人！——我是宰相的儿子。正因为如此，除去你的爱情，又有什么能抵销我父亲掠夺来的财产将遗传给我的诅咒？

露意丝　我真畏惧他哟——你那父亲！

斐迪南　我什么也不畏惧——什么也不害怕——只怕你的爱情有了限度。让我俩之间阻隔着崇山峻岭好啦，我将像登楼梯一般攀越它们，飞进我露意丝的怀抱。厄运的风暴只会鼓起我的感情之帆，危难只会使我的露意丝更加妩媚迷人。——我说，亲爱的，什么也别害怕。我——我愿亲自守护着你，就像魔龙守护着地下的宝藏——信赖我吧。你不再需要守护天使——我愿置身于你和命运之间——承受你的一切伤痛——为你搜集快乐之杯的一点一滴，然后用爱情的金盏盛着奉献给你。（温柔地搂着她）这条胳膊将支撑我的露意丝走完人生旅程；当上帝在迎接她时，将发现她比离开时更加美丽，因而惊叹塑造灵魂的工作最后只能由爱情来完成……

露意丝　（推开他，异常激动）别说啦！我求求你，别说啦！——要是你知道——别折磨我——我不知道，你的这些希望如何像箭一样刺痛我的心。（想走开）

斐迪南　（拉住她）露意丝！怎么啦？怎么回事？干吗突然这样？

露意丝　我原本忘掉了这样的梦想，生活得幸福、宁静。——可现在！可现在！——从今以后——我生活的平静失去了。——胸中将不断骚动着——我知道——种种的痴心妄想。——走吧——上帝宽恕你！——你在我宁静的年轻心房中扔了一把火，它永远永远不会熄灭。（冲出房去。斐迪南无言地追赶）





第五场


宰相家的大厅。



宰相颈上挂着枚十字勋章，勋章旁边还有一颗宝星，和秘书伍尔穆一同上场。





宰相　迷上了一个姑娘！我的儿子？——不，伍尔穆你永远别想让我相信。

伍尔穆　请大人恩准我提供证据。

宰相　要说他向一个市民的小妞献献殷勤——说些个奉承话——甚至胡诌什么情呀爱呀的——这些事情在我看来通通可能——通通可以原谅——不过呢——竟然是一名吹鼓手的女儿，你说？

伍尔穆　是乐师米勒的闺女。

宰相　模样儿俊吗？——那还用问。

伍尔穆　（提起了劲头儿）标准的金发美人，毫不夸大地说，即使排在宫里的佳丽队中，仍然出众超群。

宰相　（笑）你告诉我，伍尔穆——你显然看上了这个妞儿，我断定。——可你瞧，我亲爱的伍尔穆——如果说我儿子也对姑娘有好感，那就让我产生了一个希望：夫人小姐们将不会因此嫌弃他，他在宫里原本是有所作为的。你说那姑娘很美，这使我为我儿子高兴，他眼力不错嘛。他在傻丫头面前表现得很真诚？那就更好嘛——我看，这说明他足够机灵，可以拿谎话换得实惠，是块当宰相的材料。他甚至得手了？妙极妙极！这说明他交了桃花运。——闹剧竟然以一个健康的小孙儿收场——那更妙得无与伦比！那我便要为我家庭的兴旺发达再喝一瓶西班牙甜酒，并且替他的婊子代缴风化罚金。

伍尔穆　我唯一的希望是，大人，您不会为了消愁解闷，才不得不喝这瓶甜酒。

宰相　（严肃地）伍尔穆，你放明白点，我一旦相信什么，就会相信到底；一旦生起气来，就会暴跳如雷——你企图煽动我，我却拿它寻开心。你意在摆脱你争风吃醋的对手，对此我深信不疑。你想从姑娘身边挤走我的儿子却力不从心，就打算拿我这个老子当苍蝇拍使，这我也觉得可以理解——你出手不凡，将来定会成为一个大无赖，这甚至令我不胜欣喜——只是呢，我亲爱的伍尔穆，你千万别妄想连我也算计进去。——只是呢，你了解我，千万别把你的阴谋诡计搞得来破坏了我的基本准则。

伍尔穆　大人原谅。即使真的——如您所疑心的那样——在这里存在着吃醋的问题，那充其量也只是用到了眼睛，还没轮上舌头。

宰相　我倒认为完全可以不吃醋。你这个傻蛋，你从铸币厂得到金币，或者从银行里得到金币，这两者难道有什么区别吗？你只要想想此地的贵族老爷们，你便会心安理得啦：有意也罢，无意也罢——在我们这儿举行的每一次婚礼上，至少总有半打以上的男宾——或者侍从——是对新郎的乐园的几何尺寸了如指掌的。

伍尔穆　（鞠了一躬）在这点上，大人，我宁肯做个平民。

宰相　不过，现在我要让你高高兴兴，给你一个反击情敌的绝好机会。正是目前，为了迎接新公爵夫人的到来，内阁正筹划安排弥尔芙特夫人假意离开，并且让她新结一门亲事，以便把事情办得毫无破绽。你知道，伍尔穆，我的声望在多大程度上仰仗夫人的垂青——我的权势如何受到公爵的情绪影响。他正在为弥尔芙特寻找新的搭档。也有别人可能去应征——去做这笔交易，通过夫人博取公爵的信任，变成他无法离开的宠幸——是的，为使公爵仍然留在我的家族的网中，我要让斐迪南去娶弥尔芙特……你明白了吗？

伍尔穆　我豁然开朗，眼花缭乱……宰相大人至少向我证明，他当父亲只是位新手。要是斐迪南以牙还牙，像您做他慈爱的父亲似的做你孝顺的儿子，那就会违抗你的要求，外加提出抗议。

宰相　所幸我从来还不曾担心过什么计划不能实现，只要我认为：就该这么办！——喏，你瞧，伍尔穆，我们又回到先前的话题上来啦。今天上午我就要向我儿子宣布他订婚的事。他的表情要么证实有道理，要么将疑虑一笔勾销。

伍尔穆　大人，请您原谅我多嘴。令郎肯定不会对您有好脸色的：这既要怪您准备从他怀中夺走的那个丫头，也要怪您决定配给他的这位未婚妻。我求您做一次结论更明确的试验。您不妨选国内最清白无瑕的女孩做他的对象，他要说一声好，那我伍尔穆这个秘书甘愿去锤三年石头子儿。

宰相　（咬着嘴唇）魔鬼！

伍尔穆　情况就是这样。那女孩的母亲——一个地道的蠢婆娘——傻里傻气地全给我叨叨了出来。

宰相　（踱来踱去，强忍怒火）对！就在今天上午。

伍尔穆　大人只是别忘记了，少校是——我恩主您的公子。

宰相　注意别伤害他就是了，伍尔穆。

伍尔穆　我将尽力效劳，帮大人摆脱一个讨厌的儿媳……

宰相　我将报答你，帮你讨一个称心如意的妻子，是吗？——行啊，伍尔穆。

伍尔穆　（得意地鞠躬）永远是您的仆从，大人。（准备离开）

宰相　刚才我对你讲的是心腹话，伍尔穆——（威胁地）你要讲出去了……

伍尔穆　（笑）那大人就兜出我伪造文书的事。（离去）

宰相　你确实被攥在咱手心里。我抓住你的把柄，就像抓住拴甲壳虫的线。

内侍　（走进来）侍卫长封·卡尔勃大人到……

宰相　来得正好。——请他进来。（内侍下）





第六场


宫廷侍卫长封·卡尔勃和宰相。



前者身着华丽而俗气的朝服，背上搭着象征他职务的金钥匙，胸前挂着两只表，腰挎一柄长剑，肋下夹着平顶帽，头发梳理成了所谓的刺猬式。他大声喊着奔向宰相，身上散发的麝香味弥漫了整个大厅。





侍卫长　（拥抱宰相）啊，早安，亲爱的！休息得好吗？睡得好吗？——原谅我这么晚才来请安——公务紧急——厨房要的菜单——请帖——安排今儿个的雪橇郊游——唉——接着还得去殿下卧室上早朝，向他报告今儿个的天气。

宰相　是的，侍卫长。这么一来，您当然分不开身啦。

侍卫长　这还不算，那个混账裁缝还拖住我。

宰相　可到底彻底解决了吧？

侍卫长　事情还没完——今天真是倒霉一个接着一个。您听听！

宰相　（心不在焉）哪能呢？

侍卫长　您听着好啦。我刚跨下车，那些马就惊了，又是跳又是蹬，溅得——我请您想想！——我两条腿上全是烂泥浆。怎么办啊？请看在上帝分上设身处地为我想一想，男爵。我束手无策。时间这么晚了。事关一天的旅行——而这副德行去见殿下！上帝主持公道！——您猜我想起了什么？——您猜我想起了什么？我假装晕倒了。仆人们急急忙忙把我抬进马车。我这才十万火急地赶回家——换好了衣服——再往回赶——您说怎么着？——仍然第一个出现在谒见厅里——您看怎么样？

宰相　真是急中生智，大智大慧——可先别谈这个，卡尔勃——您和公爵谈过了吗？

侍卫长　（扬扬得意地）谈了二十分零三十秒钟。

宰相　我说哩！——这么讲，毫无疑问您给我带来了重要消息啰？

侍卫长　（先沉吟一会儿，煞有介事地）殿下今儿个穿了一件鹅黄色的海狸皮袍子。

宰相　我看呐——不，侍卫长，我今天可以告诉您一件更好的消息——弥尔芙特夫人要成为封·瓦尔特夫人啦，对您这肯定算得上新闻吧？

侍卫长　真的！——已经定了吗？

宰相　千真万确，侍卫长——我想劳您驾马上去见弥尔芙特夫人，让她准备好接待少校去拜访，并且把斐迪南的决定在整个京城公布出去。

侍卫长　（兴奋地）呵，非常乐意，亲爱的。——对我来说再好不过！——我火速赶去——（拥抱宰相）再见——不出三刻钟，全城都会传开的。（跳跳蹦蹦地出去了）

宰相　（望着侍卫长的背影笑起来）还说什么世界上的这种人是废物！——瞧着吧，要么斐迪南乖乖地同意，要么就不得不怪全城的人都在撒谎。（按铃。伍尔穆走进来）叫我儿子来一下。（伍尔穆下。宰相在厅里走来走去，心事重重）





第七场


斐迪南，宰相。



伍尔穆上场后立刻又退下。





斐迪南　您找我，父亲大人……

宰相　为了有朝一日我能为我的儿子感到荣幸，我不得不叫你来——让我们单独待一会儿吧，伍尔穆！——斐迪南，我已经观察了你好长时间，发现你已不再是一个令我欣喜的开朗快活的青年。你脸上隐隐流露出一种异样的苦闷——你躲着我——躲着你的朋友们——呸！像你这个年龄，我宁可原谅你十次放荡不羁，也不愿看见你一次这么忧心忡忡的样子。把你的苦闷告诉我，亲爱的孩子！让我为你谋幸福，照着我的话去做，别东想西想。——来，拥抱我，斐迪南！

斐迪南　您今天很慈蔼，爸爸。

宰相　今天？你这坏小子！——而且在说出这两个字时还酸溜溜的！（严肃地）斐迪南啊斐迪南！——为谁我踏上了成为公爵心腹的危险之路？为谁我昧了天理和良心，永远地？——听着，斐迪南——我是同我的儿子讲话——我除掉了我的前任，又是为谁铺平道路？——这段历史像刀一样刺着我的心，我越是想对世人隐藏真相，它越刺得我鲜血淋漓。听着，告诉我，斐迪南，我干这一切都是为了谁啊？

斐迪南　（吓得倒退一步）该不是为我吧，父亲？这一罪行的血红反光，该不会落在我的头上吧？万能的天主在上，我宁肯没生出来，也别成为这种罪行的借口才好！

宰相　这是什么话？什么话？算啦！原谅你这个满脑袋浪漫想法的傻瓜——斐迪南——爸爸不生你的气，你这自以为是的小家伙——你就是这样报答我那许许多多的不眠之夜吗？就这样报答我无尽的忧虑关怀，我良心的永恒刺痛吗？——罪责我来承担——法庭的诅咒和惩罚我来忍受——你获得的是第二手的幸福——罪孽不会附着在遗产上面。

斐迪南　（朝天举起右手）我在此起誓，绝不继承只会让我想起一个可耻的父亲的遗产。

宰相　听着，年轻人，别激怒我！——要按你的想法行事，你一辈子只能在地上爬行。

斐迪南　噢，那也不错，父亲，那毕竟比围着王侯的宝座爬来爬去要好。

宰相　（强压住怒火）哼！——必须强迫你认识自己的幸福所在。许多别的人千辛万苦也休想爬上去的位置，你玩儿似的糊里糊涂便给捧上去了。你十二岁当上见习士官，二十岁当上少校，这些都是我在公爵面前争取的结果。你将来会脱下军装，进入部里。公爵已提到过枢密顾问——驻外使节——特别的恩宠什么的。在你眼前正展示着美好的前程——一条平坦的大道直通公爵的宝座——直通与权力本身一样有价值的权力的象征——这，难道不令你鼓舞、神往吗？

斐迪南　不，因为我对伟大和幸福的理解与您不完全相同——您的幸福，很少不以毁灭为表现。嫉妒、恐惧、怨恨是一面面可悲的镜子，显赫的王侯便对着这样的镜子微笑。——眼泪、诅咒、绝望是可怕的筵席，供众所称赞的有福之人尽情享受；当他们喝得醉醺醺地站起来时，就该踉踉跄跄地去上帝的宝座前接受审判，永劫不复啦！——我关于幸福的理想，是知足而自我克制的。我的所有愿望，都埋藏在我的心中。

宰相　了不起！没说的！妙极了！过去了三十年第一次再聆听教导！——可惜啊，我五十岁了，脑袋已经顽固得再也学不进去！——对啦——为了不埋没你这罕有的才能，我要在你身边放上一个人，和她在一起，你可以尽情地去发挥你那些稀奇古怪的狂想——你得下决心——今天就下决心——娶一个妻子。

斐迪南　（惊愕，后退）爸爸？

宰相　别客气——我已经以你的名义给弥尔芙特夫人送了帖子。务必劳驾你过去告诉她，你是她未来的丈夫。

斐迪南　告诉弥尔芙特？爸爸！

宰相　如果你认识她……

斐迪南　（失去了自持）好个在公国中万人唾弃的女人！——可是我大概十分可笑，爸爸，竟把您一时的气话当了真？您未必愿做一个无赖儿子的父亲，他竟娶了一个有权有势的婊子？

宰相　岂止愿意。她要肯嫁一个五十岁的老头，我自己还会去向她求婚哩——难道你就不肯做这无赖父亲的儿子不成？

斐迪南　不！只要还有上帝！

宰相　放肆之极，我敢担保！只因为太少见，我不见怪……

斐迪南　求求您，爸爸！别再让我惶惑、难受，不清楚我是否还能称自己是您儿子。

宰相　孩子，别傻气啦！与自己的国君在某个地方交换角色，哪个聪明人不渴求获取这份殊荣呢？

斐迪南　您对我真成了一个谜，爸爸。您竟把与公爵一起分享低贱下流的乐趣，称作殊荣？

宰相　（放声大笑）

斐迪南　您笑吧，爸爸，我不计较。可真那样做了，叫我有何脸面去见一个哪怕最低贱的工匠？——他在娶老婆时至少有她完整的身体作为陪嫁。叫我有何脸面去见世人？去见公爵？去见那个将用我的耻辱来洗刷她名誉污点的姘妇本人？

宰相　你从哪儿学来这张利嘴的啊，孩子！

斐迪南　我当着您对天发誓，爸爸！您这样抛弃您的儿子，自己并不能得到幸福，而只会使他不幸。我愿意把生命交给您，如果它能帮您高升。我的生命来自于您；我将毫不犹豫地为了您的飞黄腾达而牺牲生命。——可我的荣誉，爸爸——如果您想把我的荣誉夺走，那您给予我生命就是一桩轻率的无赖行径，那我就只能诅咒您，骂您是个拉皮条的。

宰相　（拍了拍儿子的肩膀，慈蔼地）好样儿的，亲爱的孩子。现在我知道了，你是个十足的男子汉，配得上公国内最有德行的女人——她应该属于你——今天上午，你就去和奥斯特海姆女伯爵订婚吧。

斐迪南　（又一次感到愕然）怎么，这个时辰注定要完全毁了我吗？

宰相　（窥视着儿子）但愿你的荣誉再没什么好反对的！

斐迪南　不，爸爸！弗莉德里克·封·奥斯特海姆可以使任何别的男人无比幸福。（极度迷惘地自言自语）在我心中尚未被他的狠毒破坏的一点点东西，正被他的好意扯得粉碎。

宰相　（始终目不转睛地盯着儿子）我等着你感谢我喽，斐迪南——

斐迪南　（扑上去热烈地吻他的手）爸爸！您的恩情令我万分感动——爸爸！我最衷心地感谢您的关怀——您的选择完美无缺——可是——我不能——我不该——原谅我吧——我不能爱女伯爵。

宰相　（倒退一步）哈哈！这下算逮住你啦，少爷！你中了圈套，狡猾的伪君子——这就是说，并非荣誉阻止你娶弥尔芙特夫人啰？——你厌恶的不是人，而是结婚本身啰？

斐迪南　（先呆若木鸡，一会儿以后清醒过来，准备跑出去）

宰相　去哪儿？站住！这就是你对我该有的尊重吗？（少校退了回来）已经通知夫人你要去了。我答应过公爵。宫里城里尽人皆知。——你要是把我变成个说谎者——听着，孩子——或者让我发现了你的那些事情……等一等！哈哈！你的脸上怎么一下子黯淡无光，失去红润了呢？

斐迪南　（脸色苍白，浑身颤抖）什么？什么？没有的事儿，爸爸！

宰相　（目光凶狠地盯着儿子）可要是有什么——要是让我发现了你这么不听劝告的原因在哪里——哼，孩子，就算纯属怀疑也会叫我气疯的。先去吧！检阅马上开始了。一喊解散你就得去夫人那儿——我要生了气，整个公国都会打哆嗦。让咱们瞧瞧，我是否对一个顽固脑袋儿子毫无办法。（走出去又转回来）孩子，我告诉你，你必须去，要不就躲开我，躲开你愤怒的父亲！（下）

斐迪南　（恍若噩梦初醒）他走啦？那是一位父亲的声音吗？——是的！我愿去夫人那儿——愿意去——去告诉她一些事情，给她看一面镜子，这下流无耻的女人！——在这之后，如果她还要求嫁给我——当着全体贵族、军官和民众的面——用你英格兰的全部骄傲束紧你的腰——我，一个德意志青年，还是要唾弃你！（匆匆跑出去）





第二幕


弥尔芙特夫人府里的大厅。右边摆着一张沙发，左边立着一架大钢琴。





第一场


弥尔芙特夫人穿着宽松而迷人的晨衣，头发未经梳理，坐在钢琴前出神；使女索菲从窗前走回房中。





索菲　军官正好解散。检阅结束了——可我还没看见瓦尔特。

夫人　（十分不安，站起来，走过大厅）我不知道今天怎么啦，索菲——我从来没有这样过啊！——你说你压根儿没看见他？——当然当然——他用不着着急——我胸口憋闷得就像做了亏心事——去，索菲，让人把马厩里最野的那匹马给我牵来——我得去野外——去见一见人，看一看蓝天，痛痛快快地跑一跑，好让心头轻松一点。

索菲　你要感觉不舒服，夫人，那就请朋友来聚会吧。让公爵在这儿开宴会，或者把玩纸牌的桌子搬到您沙发跟前。要是公爵和他的整个宫廷都听我调遣，我干吗还闷闷不乐呢？

夫人　（猛然坐到沙发上）我求你，别再烦我。只要你让我清静，我愿每个钟头赏你一枚金刚钻！竟要我让那些个家伙来装点我的房子？——这是些卑贱、可怜的人，一当我脱口说出一句热诚的心里话，他们便张大嘴巴和鼻孔，傻愣愣地像见了幽灵似的——全都是拴在一条线上的木偶，操纵起来比我钩花边还容易。——这种人的心跳得跟他们的怀表一样四平八稳，我与他们有什么交道好打啊？我预先便知道他们会回答我什么，我哪儿还有兴致向他们提出问题呢？他们连发表与我不同的意见的胆量都没有，我怎么会乐意与他们交谈呢？——去他们的吧！一匹连缰绳都不敢咬的马，骑起来可真没劲儿！（踱到窗前）

索菲　可公爵你该觉得是个例外吧，夫人？整个公国最美的男子——最热烈的情人——最机智的头脑！

夫人　（从窗前踱回来）因为这是他的国家——而只有这个公国，索菲，对于我的口味来说还可成为差强人意的借口——你说人家羡慕我？可怜的东西！他们应该同情我才是。在所有吸吮殿下乳汁的人中间，情妇是最可悲的一个；因为只有她知道这个显赫而豪富的人其实不过是个叫花子——不错，他可以用他权力的灵符唤起我心头的种种欲望，就像从地里唤出一座仙女的宫殿。——他可以把两个印度的血浆摆上我的筵席——可以叫荒野出现乐园——可以使他国中的泉水喷上天空，划出骄傲的弧形，或者将他的臣仆的骨髓变成烟火，燃放到空中去——可他也能命令他的心，在一颗博大而火热的心面前，同样博大而火热地跳动吗？他能强令他那平庸的脑子，哪怕认同唯一一种美好的感情吗？——我尽管感官享受充足，心却忍受着饥渴。在一个我不得不窒息激情的地方，千百种情感对我又有什么用处？

索菲　（惊异地望着弥尔芙特）我伺候您多久了啊，夫人？

夫人　你今天才认识我吗？——不错，亲爱的索菲——我把自己的荣誉出卖给了公爵，不过我的心仍然是自由的——这颗心，好妹妹，也许还配得到一个男人的爱——宫廷的毒雾拂过它，只不过如明镜上哈了一口气——相信我，亲爱的，要不是虚荣心阻止我将宫中第一夫人的位置让出去，我早就不会听任这位寒酸的公爵的摆布啦。

索菲　您的心就这么甘愿做虚荣的奴隶吗？

夫人　（激动地）已经受到了惩罚，不是吗？——现在还在受惩罚，是不是？——索菲哟！（意味深长地，手抚着索菲的肩膀）我们女人只能在统治与效忠之间进行选择；可是执掌权力的最大乐趣，也只不过是一种可怜的补偿，我们失去了更大的快乐——成为一个我们所钟爱的男子的奴仆的快乐。

索菲　千真万确的真理，夫人，可我极不情愿听您说出来。

夫人　为什么呢，索菲？难道从这执掌权杖的幼稚举动，不能看出我们只配去牵小儿学步的带子吗？难道你看不出这任性的轻浮，这种种粗野的享乐，只不过是为了掩盖我胸中更加狂暴的欲望吗？

索菲　（吃惊地后退一步）夫人！

夫人　（更兴奋地）满足这些欲望吧！把我所想念的——所祈求的男子给我吧！索菲——我要么为他而死，要么占有他。（神往地）让我从他嘴里听到，我们眼里爱情的泪水比我们发间的珠宝更加晶莹，更加美丽，（狂热地）我将把公爵的心连同他的公国掷于他的脚下，同他——同我钟爱的男子一起逃跑，逃到世界最偏远的沙漠里去……

索菲　（惊恐地望着弥尔芙特）天哪！你说些什么？您怎么啦，夫人？

夫人　（愕然）干吗脸色苍白？——我说得也许过了头？——噢，那就让我把你的舌头和我的信任捆在一起吧——我还要对你说更多——对你说出一切——

索菲　（畏葸地环顾四周）我害怕，夫人——我害怕——我不需要再听。

夫人　让我与少校结合——你和世人全犯了傻，以为那是宫廷里司空见惯的阴谋——索菲——别脸红——别为我害臊——那是我的爱情的——杰作。

索菲　上帝做证！我早有预感！

夫人　他们让我说动了，索菲——那软弱的公爵——那圆滑的宰相——那愚蠢的侍卫长——他们一个个赌咒发誓，说这场婚事是为公爵保住我的万无一失的手段，它将使我和公爵的结合更加紧密牢固。——呸！将把它永远分开！将使我永远挣脱这可耻的锁链！——这帮受了骗的骗子！竟让一个弱女子给蒙了！——是你们自己把我的心上人送到了我面前！这我真叫求之不得啊——只要我一得到他——得到他——呵，永远永远滚开吧，可恶的荣华——





第二场


公爵的一名老侍从捧着首饰匣。



前场人物。





侍从　公爵殿下向夫人致意，派我送来这些钻石作为您结婚的礼物。它们刚从威尼斯运到这里。

夫人　（揭开首饰匣，惊讶得往后退去）天哪！公爵为这些宝石花了多少钱？

侍从　（脸色阴沉地）没花他一个子儿。

夫人　什么？你疯了吗？没花一个子儿？——瞧你（从老人身边后退了一步）——怎么这样瞪着我，好像要看穿我似的！——这些无价之宝没花他一个子儿？

侍从　昨天，又有七千子弟出发去了美洲[1]——他们偿付了一切。

夫人　（突然放下首饰匣，疾步穿过大厅，一会儿又回到侍从跟前）喂，你怎么啦？我看，你在哭？

侍从　（擦干眼泪，浑身战栗，嗓音凄惨）这儿的宝石——我也有几个儿子跟着去了。

夫人　（一怔，转开脸，握住老人的手）总不会有谁是被迫的吧？

侍从　（狂笑）呵，上帝——不——全都心甘情愿！当时有那么几个多嘴的小伙子走出队列，问上校，公爵卖他们出去定价多少钱一对？——谁知咱们仁爱无比的国君命令所有团队一齐开上阅兵场，当众枪决了那几个快嘴多舌的小子。我们只听见噼噼啪啪一阵枪响，看见孩子们的脑浆飞溅到了广场的石头地上，与此同时，全军齐声呼喊：哟嘿，去美洲啰！——

夫人　（震惊，跌倒在沙发上）上帝！上帝！——我却什么也没听见！我却什么也没察觉！

侍从　是喽，夫人——不然在擂响起程鼓的时候，您和咱们主上干吗偏偏要去追捕狗熊呢？——您倒是真不该错过那辉煌的场面！当刺耳的鼓声向人们宣布，出发时间到了，便只见这儿一群哭喊着的孤儿在追赶还活着的父亲，那儿一个母亲发了疯，正冲上去准备把尚在吃奶的婴儿插到刺刀上去；为了把新婚的夫妇分开，军官们只好用刀劈；咱们老头子只好绝望地站在原地，临了儿也把手杖扔给孩子们，让手杖陪伴他们到新世界去——呵，战鼓一直擂得震天价响，为的是全能的主听不见我们的祷告声——

夫人　（从沙发上站起，激动异常）把这些钻石拿走——它闪闪烁烁，把地狱的火焰射进了我心里！（温和地转向侍从）别太难过，可怜的老人。他们会回来的。他们会再见到自己的祖国。

侍从　（动情地，专注地）只有上帝知道！他们会的！——到了城门口他们还转过身来高呼：“上帝与你们同在，老婆和孩子们——咱们的公爵万岁——等到接受上帝审判那天，咱们会回来的！”

夫人　（大步绕室疾走）可耻！可怕！——他们骗我说，我已拭干了公国所有的眼泪——现在我算睁开眼了，恐怖地睁开眼了——去吧——去告诉你的主上——我将当面向他道谢！（侍从准备退下，她将自己的钱包扔进他帽子里）拿去吧，作为你对我说了真话的报酬——

侍从　（轻蔑地将钱包扔回桌子上）请留下吧，对您说来是不会嫌多的。（下）

夫人　（惊讶地目送着他）索菲，快追上去，问他叫什么名字。我要让他再见到他的儿子。（索菲下。夫人沉思着走上走下。少顷，对重新上场的索菲）最近不是传说边境上有座城市发生火灾，使四百个家庭沦为乞丐了吗？（按铃）

索菲　你怎么突然想到这个？是有这么回事，那些不幸的人现在多数成了他们债主的奴隶，不然就在公爵的银矿里卖命。

仆人　（走进来）夫人有何吩咐？

夫人　（把首饰匣递给他）立刻送到市里去！——马上换成现钱，我命令；然后把换来的钱分给那四百户遭了火灾的穷人。

索菲　夫人，您考虑考虑，您这样做会失去公爵恩宠的。

夫人　（庄严地）难道要我头上戴着全国的诅咒吗？（挥手示意仆人离开）要不你愿意这些眼泪凝成的可怕首饰压得我倒下吧？——去，索菲——还是头上戴一些假珠宝，心里意识到做过这样的善事更好。

索菲　可刚才那样的珠宝！难道您不能拿你次一点的去卖吗？不，真的，夫人，你这样做太不该！

夫人　傻丫头！这样做了，刹那间我便得到了更多的钻石和珠宝，比十个国王戴在王冠上的还要多，还更美——

仆人　（又走进来）封·瓦尔特少校到。

索菲　（冲向夫人）天哪！您多么苍白——

夫人　这是第一个使我惊慌失措的男人——索菲——我不舒服，爱德华[2]——等一等——他开心吗？他面带笑容吗？他说什么来着？呵，索菲！我很难看，是不是？

索菲　我求求您，夫人……

仆人　您吩咐我打发他走吗？

夫人　（结结巴巴地）说我欢迎他。（仆人下）告诉我，索菲——我对他讲什么好？我怎样接待他？——我会哑口无言的——他将讥讽我的软弱——我心多么虚啊——你要离开我吗，索菲？——留下——唉不！走吧！——还是留下好些。（少校穿过前厅，走进屋来）

索菲　精神一点！他已经来了。

第三场


斐迪南·封·瓦尔特。前场人物。





斐迪南　（微微一鞠躬）要是我打扰了您，夫人……

夫人　（心激烈地跳着）一点儿也不，少校先生，您来再好不过。

斐迪南　我来是奉家父之命……

夫人　那我得感谢他。

斐迪南　奉他之命告诉您，我俩将要结婚——父亲吩咐的就这些。

夫人　（失色，战栗）不是您自己的心愿吗？

斐迪南　大臣们和拉牵做媒的人一样，从来不问这个。

夫人　（惊惧，语塞）而您自己就没有一点别的要说吗？

斐迪南　（瞅了使女一眼）还有很多，夫人。

夫人　（示意索菲，索菲退出）可以请您坐在这张沙发上吗？

斐迪南　我将尽量简短，夫人。

夫人　喏？

斐迪南　我是个堂堂的男子汉。

夫人　我敬重这样的男人。

斐迪南　还是个骑士。

夫人　公国里出类拔萃的骑士。

斐迪南　还是军官。

夫人　（讨好地）您只提到一些其他人与您同样具备的优点。您干吗对那些更加重要的独特品格避而不谈呢？

斐迪南　（冷冷地）我在这儿用不着它们。

夫人　（越来越恐惧）可是，我该如何理解您这开场白呢？

斐迪南　（缓慢而加重语气）理解为自尊心的抗议，如果您真有兴趣来强迫我娶您。

夫人　（生气地）这是什么话，少校先生？

斐迪南　（从容地）我的心里话——我的族徽的话——这把宝剑的话。

夫人　这把宝剑是公爵赐给你的。

斐迪南　是国家假公爵之名将它给了我——我的心就是我的上帝——我家族的纹章已有五百年历史。

夫人　公爵的名义……

斐迪南　（激动地）公爵难道能歪曲人类的准则，或者像铸造他的三分铜币一样任意支配人的行动吗？——他自己不威严、崇高，却能够用金子堵住尊严的嘴巴。他可以用银鼬皮袍遮盖他的耻辱。我请求您别再扯这些，夫人——这儿要谈的不再是抛弃了的前程和祖先——不再是这剑上的穗子——不再是世人的看法。我做好准备了，一旦您能证明，我获得的奖赏不低于付出的代价，上面所说的一切我通通可以抛弃。

夫人　（痛心地离开他）少校先生，我不配让你做出这么大的牺牲。

斐迪南　（抓住她的手）请原谅。我们在这儿谈话没有第三者。使您和我今天——除了今天再也不会走到一起来的情况迫使我，使我有理由对您不再隐讳我心灵深处的情感。——我真不敢相信，夫人，一位这么美丽、这么富有灵气的女子——她这些品质会得到男人的尊重——怎么可能委身于一个只是贪恋她的肉体的公爵；这个女子怎么不知羞耻，竟然同时又向另一位男子献上她的心。

夫人　（睁大眼睛瞪着他的脸）请痛痛快快地说完吧。

斐迪南　您自称是个英国人。恕我冒昧——我不能相信您真是英国人——一个天底下最自由的人民的生而自由的女儿。她太骄傲了，对别国的德行尚且不屑一顾，不肯受其影响，更永远别提会附和他人的罪孽呐。不可能，您不会是一位英国女子——要不，您这英国女人的心脏必定太小太小，不配有真正英国女子豪迈而勇敢跳动的脉搏！

夫人　您说完了吗？

斐迪南　有人也许会回答，这是妇女的虚荣心——重感情——易冲动——好享受。经常是德行比名声更能持久。曾经有过一些人，开始时名誉扫地，后来却以自己的高尚行为取得了世人谅解，用善举把丑恶化为了高贵——可是，目前公国内为何压迫空前未有的深重、可怕？——一切都盗用了国家的名义！——我没什么说的了。

夫人　（温柔地，庄重地）瓦尔特，这是头一次有人敢对我讲这种话；而您，是唯一一个我愿意给予回答的男子。——你鄙视与我结合，我因此尊重您。您亵渎我的心，我不怪罪您。我不相信，您真这么鄙弃我。一个人敢于去这样侮辱一位翻掌之间就可以毁掉他的妇女，必定是相信这位妇女有一颗博大的心，要不然——他就精神失常。——您把国家的灾难归罪到我身上，但愿万能的上帝会原谅您；有朝一日，他将让您和我和公爵对质的。——可您竟然怀疑我是一名英国女子：对您这样的指责，我的祖国不会不给予回答的。

斐迪南　（身子倚着佩剑）我急于马上知道。

夫人　那就听好了。除您之外，我还从未告诉任何人，也不愿告诉任何人。——我不是一个冒险家，瓦尔特，像您认为的那样。我本可以趾高气扬地说：我有着高贵的血统——出身在为苏格兰女王玛利亚牺牲了的不幸的托马斯·诺弗克家族。[1]——先父是国王陛下的侍从长官，受人诬陷，被认定背叛国家，勾结法兰西。议会判他有罪，他被斩了首。——我家的所有财产都归王室所有了。我们自己被驱逐出了英国。我母亲死在父亲被处决的当天。我本人——一个十四岁的小姑娘——跟着保姆逃到了德国，带着一盒珠宝——还有这个家传的十字架；我母亲在弥留之际一边给我最后的祝福，一边把它戴在了我胸前。

斐迪南　（慢慢陷入沉思，盯着夫人的目光变得温暖起来）

夫人　（越往下说越是激动）带着病——没有名声——没有保护人和财产——我一个异国孤女来到了汉堡。除了一点法语——一点针线活儿和会弹钢琴之外，别无任何本领；相反倒习惯了使用金银餐具——盖锦缎被褥，呼奴使婢，颐指气使，接受大人先生们的阿谀奉承。——终于哭着过完了六年。——最后的一件首饰飞掉了——我那保姆也一命呜呼——这时我的命运之星将您的公爵带到了汉堡来。那天我在易北河边散步，正望着江水开始胡思乱想，想弄清楚是这江水更深呢还是我的痛苦更深，公爵看见了我，跟踪我到了我的住处——跪在我脚下发誓说他爱我。（激动得停下来，然后哽咽着往下说）我幸福的童年又带着美丽迷人的光彩，一幕一幕呈现在眼前——可是未来却黑暗如同墓穴，令我毛骨悚然——我的心渴望从另一颗心获取温暖——于是便与他的心靠在了一起。（从斐迪南身边跑开）现在您可以诅咒我了！

斐迪南　（非常感动，追上去拉住她）夫人！呵，天哪！我听见了什么？我干了些什么？——我的罪孽突然明摆在我面前，可怕啊！您再也不可能原谅我啦。

夫人　（走回来，努力克制着自己）您往下听。公爵虽然使我这个没有反抗能力的少女感到措手不及——可我身上的诺弗克家庭的血液却提出抗议：你，一位天生的侯爵小姐，艾米莉，竟甘当一个国君的情妇吗？——公爵将我带到这儿，在我眼前突然展现出最可怖的情景，于是自尊和命运在我心里开始了长期的斗争。——这个世界的大人物荒淫纵乐，就像永远不知饱足的鬣狗，老在贪婪地搜寻着牺牲品。——在这个公国内他们横行肆虐——拆散一对对新婚夫妇——撕碎神圣的婚姻纽带——破坏家庭的幸福温馨——让年幼无知的心遭受黑死病的传染毒害，而一些女学生在临死前一边痉挛，一边诅咒，流着泡沫的嘴里泄露出来的竟是她们教师的名字。——我被夹在了羔羊和虎狼之间，常常在幽会的温情时刻逼着公爵许下誓愿：那样可憎的牺牲该到头啦！

斐迪南　（激动得绕室狂走）别说了，夫人！别再说下去！

夫人　这可悲的时期后面接着更加可悲的时期。一时间，宫廷和后宫中充斥着意大利来的下流货，风骚的巴黎女人用可怕的权杖打情骂俏，民众在她们喜怒无常的摆布下流着鲜血——你们全都经历过当时的情景。是我，后来让她们失了势，因为我比她们更风流。我让暴君在我的怀抱中飘飘然，从他有气无力的手中夺过了权柄——你的祖国，瓦尔特，才第一次感受到人的抚慰，信赖地靠在了我的胸口上。（停下来，脉脉含情地望着他）呵，这个唯一我不愿意他误解我的男子，现在逼得我只好夸夸其谈，把我秘而不宣的德行讲了出来，任赞叹的阳光暴晒！——瓦尔特，我砸碎过牢狱的铁锁——撕碎过死刑判决书——缩短过苦役船上可怕的终身流放。给无法治愈的创伤至少注入了减轻痛苦的油膏——并且常常叫有权有势的罪犯倒霉，年轻人，那才叫痛快呀！任何对于我高贵出身的责难，我的心都可以无比骄傲地予以驳斥！——可那唯一能够给我所作所为以报偿的男子——那我多咎的命运创造来弥补我已承受的痛苦的男子——那我在梦中已热烈渴慕和拥抱的男子，他现在竟来……

斐迪南　（抢过话头，极度震惊地）够啦！够啦！这违反了约定，夫人！您可以洗刷对您的责难，指出我的罪过。可请您怜惜——我请求您——怜惜我的心；它快要被惭愧和悔恨撕碎啦——

夫人　（紧握他的手）要么现在讲，要么永远别讲了。这个女人已经勇敢地坚持了很长时间——现在必须让您再感到她泪水的分量。（语气温柔地）听我说啊，瓦尔特——如果一个不幸的女子——受到你不可抗拒的强有力的吸引——用她满怀着无限热爱的胸脯贴近你的身体——瓦尔特呵——你此刻还会冷冰冰地谈什么荣誉吗？——如果这个不幸的女子——忍辱含羞——厌倦了行恶——在德行的召唤下勇敢地站了起来——这样投身你的怀抱（边说边抱住瓦尔特，恳求地，庄严地）——希望你拯救她——希望由你重新送进天国，或者（背转脸，嗓音空虚而颤抖）从你面前逃开，发出可怕的绝望的号叫，听天由命，重新沦落进更加可憎的罪恶的深渊……

斐迪南　（挣脱她的怀抱，狼狈之极）不，伟大的上帝知道，我受不了啦！——夫人，我必须——凭着天地起誓——我必须向您承认一件事情，夫人。

夫人　（从他身边逃开）现在别！现在别！我以对我神圣的一切的名义求你——在这可怕的一刻，我的心像被万千支匕首刺破了似的在流血——死也罢，活也罢——我现在不能——我现在不愿——听你表白。

斐迪南　你得听，你得听，好夫人！您必须听我讲。我现在要对您讲的话，将减轻我的罪过，并稍微表示一下我对刚才发生的事情的歉意——我看错了您，夫人。我曾期待——我曾希望您是该当受我蔑视的。我所以来府上，就是下定决心要侮辱您，招您的恨——要是我这打算成功了，我俩会多幸福啊！（沉默片刻，然后更加轻声，更加羞怯）我爱上了，夫人——爱上了一个市民姑娘——她叫露意丝·米勒小姐，一位音乐家的女儿。（夫人脸色苍白地背转身去。他更兴奋地往下讲）我知道我堕入了怎样的境地；可要是智慧能让激情沉默，责任的声音却更加响亮——我负有罪责！一开头，我撕破了她处女的金子般的宁静——用痴心妄想迷住她的心，把它出卖给了狂野的激情。——您会提醒我注意我的地位——我的出身——我父亲的信条——可是我爱她！——我天性的追求与种种陈规陋习越是背道而驰，我抱的期望就越高。——我的决心与世俗的偏见誓不两立！——让我们看看，能永远存在下去的是时尚，或是人的本性。（这期间夫人已退到大厅的尽头，双手捂住了脸。斐迪南一直紧跟着她）您还想对我讲什么吗，夫人？

夫人　（表情异常痛苦）没有了，封·瓦尔特先生！除去您将毁掉自己，毁掉我，并且毁掉另外一个女人之外，什么都没有了！

斐迪南　还有另外一个女人？

夫人　我们在一起不会幸福。可我们又不得不成为您父亲急性子的牺牲品。一个只是被迫将手伸给我的男人，我一辈子也不可能得到他的心。

斐迪南　被迫，夫人？被迫伸手给您？可到底给了没有呢？您难道能够强夺一只并不情愿伸给您的手不成？您难道能强使一个视这姑娘为整个世界的男子离开她，来到您的身边不成？夫人啊，您——在这一刻之前，您还是一位令人钦敬的英国女子——您能够这样做吗？

夫人　因为我必须这样做。（严肃而坚定地）我的热情，瓦尔特，压不过我对您的柔情。我的名声，再也不能……全城的人都在谈论我俩的结合。所有的眼睛，所有嘲讽的利箭，全瞄准了我。要是公爵的一个臣仆尚且拒绝了我，那对我将是一个永远洗刷不掉的奇耻大辱。和您的父亲理论去吧！尽可能地反抗吧！——我将一不做，二不休！（快步走下。少校瞠目结舌，呆若木鸡，随后也冲出门去）

第四场


乐师家的房间。



米勒、米勒太太、露意丝同上。





米勒　（疾步走进房来）我早说过了不是！

露意丝　（胆怯地迎上去）怎么啦，爸爸，怎么啦？

米勒　（绕室狂奔）拿我的礼服来——快点——我必须赶在他前边——还有一件活袖头的白衬衫！——我早料到会出事！

露意丝　看在上帝分上！怎么啦？

米勒太太　出了什么事？到底什么事？

米勒　（将假发扔得老远）快拿去理发师梳一下！——怎么啦？（跳到镜子面前）还有胡子也半卡长了！——出了什么事？——还会出什么事哟，你这个死人！——报应到啦，活该你遭雷劈！

米勒太太　瞧瞧吧！啥事儿都赖我。

米勒　赖你？是啊，不赖你这该死的尖嘴婆娘还赖谁？今儿个一早，和你那恶魔小爷——我不是马上说了吗？——伍尔穆那家伙给叨叨出去啦！

米勒太太　嗨，什么！你怎么会知道？

米勒　我怎么会知道？——得！大门口已经有宰相的一个狗杂种在探头探脑，打听提琴师家的情况。

露意丝　我快完了。

米勒　不只是你，还有你那对情意绵绵的眼睛！（恶狠狠地，大笑）真是不错：魔鬼在谁家下了蛋，谁家就会养出个漂亮妞儿。——我现在算领教了！

米勒太太　你从哪儿知道是冲咱露意丝来的？——没准儿有谁向公爵推荐了你。没准儿他要你进他的乐队。

米勒　（跳过去抓棍子）倒你鬼老婆子的邪霉！还乐队咧！——可不，来叫你这老媒婆用号叫充女高音，叫我这青紫的屁股给你作低音伴唱。（猛地坐到椅子上）天上的主啊！

露意丝　（脸色惨白，坐下）妈！爸！怎么我突然心慌意乱？

米勒　（从椅子上跳起来）可那耍笔杆儿的要是什么时候让我给撞上？——让我给撞上？不管是在阳世还是在阴间——我要不把他的肉体和灵魂捶成烂酱，要不拿他的狗皮来抄《圣经》“十诫”和七篇“悔罪雅歌”，抄《摩西五书》以及先知穆罕默德的经文，让世人到亡灵复活之日还看得见他皮上的蓝色字迹，那我就……

米勒太太　是的是的！你咒吧，你跳吧！你这样就可以镇住魔鬼啦！救救咱们啊，仁慈的主！现在怎么办？谁能给咱们出主意？怎么才收得了场喽？米勒老爹，你可是说呀！（哭喊着在房中乱跑一气）

米勒　我这就去见宰相。我要抢先开口——要自己说明原委。你呢，知道得比我早，本该提醒我才是。这丫头也许还劝得回来。也许时间还来得及——可是你没有！——这里边没准儿能捞到点好处哩，这里边没准儿能钓上条大鱼哩！于是你火上浇油！——现在该你去领你的媒婆赏钱啦！你这叫自作自受！我呢，只管带着我的女儿，离开这个国家。





第五场


斐迪南·封·瓦尔特冲进房间，慌慌张张，上气不接下气。



前场人物。





斐迪南　我父亲来过了吗？

露意丝　（惊惶不安）你父亲？万能的主啊！

米勒太太　（双手一拍）宰相大人！咱们完啦！（三人异口同声）

米勒　（冷笑两声）赞美上帝！咱们报应到了！

斐迪南　（奔向露意丝，把她抱在怀中）你是我的，不怕天堂和地狱从中阻拦！

露意丝　我注定活不了啦——说下去——你刚才说了一个可怕的名字——你的父亲？

斐迪南　没什么，没什么。事情已经过去了。我又重新得到了你。你又重新得到了我。让我先在你怀中喘口气吧。刚才那一刻太可怕啦。

露意丝　怎样的时刻呢？你快急死我了！

斐迪南　（倒退一步，若有所悟地打量着她）一个在我的心与你之间，露意丝，插进来一个陌生人的时刻——一个使我的爱在我的良心面前变得苍白失色的时刻——一个我的露意丝不再是她斐迪南的一切一切的时刻……

露意丝　（蒙着脸，倒在椅子上）

斐迪南　（跑向她，目光呆滞地站在她面前，说不出一句话，然后突然离开她，激动异常）不！绝不！不可能，夫人！您太过分了！我不能为您牺牲这个纯洁无邪的少女！——不，以永恒的上帝起誓！我不能背弃我的誓言，它像天上的雷霆一样大声地警告我，从这双失去了神采的眼睛里——夫人，您瞧瞧吧，瞧瞧吧——像乌鸦一般狠心的父亲呵，你要掐死这个天使吗？你要我在她圣洁的胸中撒播地狱之火吗？（坚决地跑回露意丝跟前）我要领她去接受世界末日的审判，让永恒的上帝讲，我爱她是不是犯罪。（拉住露意丝的手，扶她站起来）鼓起勇气，亲爱的！——你胜利了。在那最危险的搏斗中，我成了胜利者。

露意丝　不！不！什么也别瞒着我！说出来吧，那可怕的判决。你提到你父亲？你提到夫人？——我怕得要命——人家说，她要结婚了。

斐迪南　（茫然地跪倒在她脚下）是跟我哟，不幸的人！

露意丝　（停了停，声音微微颤抖，可怕的沉着镇静）喏——我还担的哪份儿惊呢？——那边那位老人不是一再告诫我——要我永远别相信他的话。（稍停，然后哭着扑进米勒怀中）爸爸，你的女儿回到你身边来啦——原谅我吧，爸爸——别怪你的孩子，那个梦太美啦，可是啊——现在醒来越加可怕！——

米勒　露意丝！露意丝！——上帝呵，她神经不正常了！——我的女儿，我可怜的孩子！——该死的诱骗者！——该死的拉皮条的婆娘！

米勒太太　（哭喊着扑向露意丝）我该受这样的咒骂吗，我的女儿？上帝饶恕您，男爵——这小羊羔做了什么错事，您要掐死她？

斐迪南　（从露意丝脚下跳起来，坚定地）可我一定要戳穿他的所有阴谋——扯断那一切偏见的锁链——我要像个男子汉似的自由地选择爱人，让那班小人在我爱情的参天大树下晕头转向吧！（准备离去）

露意丝　（战栗着从椅子上站起来，追上他）别走！别走！你要去哪儿？——爸爸——妈妈——在这可怕的时刻他要离开我们？

米勒太太　（追上去拉住斐迪南）宰相大人会上这儿来——他会虐待咱闺女——他会虐待我们——封·瓦尔特少爷，你却要扔下我们吗？

米勒　（狂笑）扔下我们。当然当然！干吗不呢？——她已经把一切给了他！——（一只手拉着少校，一只手拉着露意丝）别着急，先生！要离开我的家，只能从她身上踩过去！——你要不是流氓，就先等令尊大人来——告诉他，你怎么偷走了她的心，你这骗子，要不然，上帝做证！（把女儿扔给斐迪南，狂暴地）就当着我的面，先把这只因为爱你而身败名裂的可怜虫给踩死！

斐迪南　（回到房中，沉思着踱来踱去）宰相的权力固然很大——父权也是个含义广泛的词儿——罪行本身可以隐藏在他脸上的皱纹中——他可以为所欲为——为所欲为！——然而，只有爱情能做到一切——来，露意丝，把手伸给我！（拉住露意丝的手，用力地）就这样，直到最后一息上帝也不会离开我，真的！——那分开这两只手的一瞬，也将扯断我与造化的联系。

露意丝　我害怕！转过脸去，你嘴唇颤抖。你眼睛转动起来叫人害怕……

斐迪南　不，露意丝，别哆嗦。我不是在说胡话。在这关键时刻，被压抑的心胸唯有想入非非才可能舒畅舒畅，这时候能够做出决断的，唯有上帝特殊的恩赐！——我爱你，露意丝——你应该和我在一起，露意丝——现在去见我的父亲！（疾步出房，正撞上宰相跨进门来）





第六场


宰相带着一帮侍从。前场人物。





宰相　（边进门边说）他已经在这里。

众人　（惊恐）

斐迪南　（后退几步）在一个清白人家。

宰相　在儿子能学会孝敬父亲的地方吗？

斐迪南　请您别扯这个——

宰相　（打断他，脸转向米勒）他是父亲吗？

米勒　米勒乐师。

宰相　（脸朝米勒太太）她是母亲？

米勒太太　没错儿！母亲。

斐迪南　（对米勒）爸爸，您把女儿带走吗——她快晕倒了。

宰相　瞎操心，我还有话问她呐。（对露意丝）你认识宰相的少爷多久了？

露意丝　我从不管什么少爷不少爷。从十一月份起，斐迪南·封·瓦尔特就来家里看我。

斐迪南　来追求她。

宰相　你得到什么许诺了吗？

斐迪南　就在刚才，当着上帝的面，我给了她最庄严神圣的许诺。

宰相　（恼怒地冲着儿子）蠢材，有你后悔的！（对露意丝）我等你回答哩。

露意丝　他起誓他爱我。

斐迪南　而且将信守誓言。

宰相　非要我命令你住口吗？——你接受他的誓言？

露意丝　（温柔地）我给了他回报。

斐迪南　（语气坚定地）已结下海誓山盟。

宰相　我非把你这应声虫扔出去不可。（恶毒地冲着露意丝）他可是每次都付现钱，对吗？

露意丝　（专注地）我不完全明白您问的什么意思。

宰相　（暗暗冷笑）不明白？喏喏！这只是说——操任何营生，俗话说，总有它的搞头——而你呢，我希望，也不会白白奉送，没捞到好处——或者你想的只是玩一玩，对吗？

斐迪南　（勃然大怒）混账！这叫什么话？

露意丝　（对斐迪南，庄重而无奈地）封·瓦尔特先生，现在您自由了。

斐迪南　爸爸！德行即使衣衫褴褛，如同乞丐，同样应该受到尊重。

宰相　（大笑）可笑的妄想！竟要老子尊重儿子的婊子。

露意丝　（昏倒）天啊！天啊！

斐迪南　（与露意丝同时开口，并且拔出剑来刺向父亲，半道上却垂下了宝剑）爸爸！您原本有权要我把我的生命还给您——现在算是清了账了（插回宝剑）——从此我这个儿子不再欠您任何的情！——

米勒　（一直恐惧地站在一边，这时激动地走上前来，一会儿气得咬牙切齿，一会儿怕得牙齿磕磕碰碰）我说大人——孩子是父亲的骨肉心肝——劳驾您给我记住——谁骂他女儿是婊子，谁就打了他的耳光；而你打他他也得同样打你——咱们的信条如此——劳驾您给我记住。

米勒太太　行行好吧，上帝和救世主！——现在老头子也火啦！——咱们大难临头了！

宰相　（似未完全听明白）怎么，老龟头也发火了吗？——我们这就跟你算账，老龟头！

米勒　劳您的驾，我的名字叫米勒，如果您听我奏一段柔板的话——给娼妓拉客咱不干。多会儿宫里边还有足够的人手，就轮不上咱这些平民百姓。劳您的驾！

米勒太太　看在上帝分上，老头子！你要害死你老婆孩子啦！

斐迪南　您在这儿扮演的什么角色哟，爸爸，竟当着这么多人的面。

米勒　（走过宰相，鼓起勇气）明明白白地说吧。劳您的驾！在公国范围内，大人您有权有势，想干啥可以干啥。可这儿是我的家。如果有朝一日我要递交份请愿书，我也许会毕恭毕敬；可一个没礼貌的客人，我将马上赶他出门去——劳您的驾！

宰相　（气得脸色苍白）什么？——什么意思？（逼近米勒）

米勒　（缓缓后退）我就是这个意思，大人——劳您的驾。

宰相　（火冒三丈）哈，反了你啦！你口出狂言，想蹲监狱是不是！——去，把法警叫来。（随从数人下。怒气冲冲，绕室狂奔）把父亲关进监狱——把母亲和卖淫的女儿绑到耻辱柱上示众——法律的铁腕将代我平息我的愤怒。对这样的侮辱，我一定要狠狠报复——难道能容忍这样的下流坯破坏我的计划，离间我们父子而不给予惩处！——哈，这帮该死的家伙！我要你们通通完蛋才解恨，我要用复仇的怒火把你们全家，父亲、母亲和女儿，烧成灰烬！

斐迪南　（走到米勒一家中间，从容坚定地）呵，别这样！用不着害怕！有我在哩。（对宰相，恭顺地）别太性急，爸爸！如果您自爱，就别使用暴力——我心中有一个地方，父亲这个字眼还从未进入过——请您别硬要进里边去。

宰相　不要脸的东西！住嘴！别给我火上加油！

米勒　（从惊吓中回过神来）看好你孩子，老婆。我去找公爵。——他御用的裁缝——上帝指点了我！——他御用的裁缝在跟我学吹横笛。在公爵那儿我不会有问题的。（打算离开）

宰相　找公爵，你说——你忘了吧，我是公爵的门槛！你想跳过去，不摔断脖子才怪哩！——找公爵，你这傻瓜！——你试一试，看我不把你扔进深深的地牢，扔进那不见天日、不闻人声、阴森恐怖如同地狱的地方，活不成，也死不了——到那时，你将铁索锒铛，哭哭哀哀，说什么：我真是太不幸啦！





第七场


法警数名。前场人物。





斐迪南　（奔向露意丝。她昏倒在他臂弯里，不省人事）露意丝！帮我一下！救救她！她被吓昏过去了！

米勒　（抓起一根藤条，戴上帽子，准备动粗的样子）

米勒太太　（跪倒在宰相面前）

宰相　（冲法警亮了亮他的勋章）动手吧，以公爵的名义——孩子，离开这个婊子——管她晕倒不晕倒！——等她脖子套上铁链，别人就会用石头将她砸醒的。

米勒太太　发发慈悲吧，大人！发发慈悲！发发慈悲！

米勒　（一把将妻子拽起来）给上帝下跪去吧，老虔婆，别给——别给恶棍下跪，我反正少不了进监狱！

宰相　（咬了咬嘴唇）你算计错啦，混蛋。还有绞架等着哩！（对法警们）难道要我再说一遍吗！

众法警　（冲向露意丝）

斐迪南　（从露意丝身边跳起，挡在她面前，怒不可遏）看谁敢动一动！（举起带鞘的宝剑，用剑柄挥打法警）谁敢碰一碰她，谁就当心自己的脑袋。（对宰相）请你放珍重点。别逼我太过分，爸爸！

宰相　（威胁法警）你们还要饭碗吗，胆小鬼……

众法警　（重新冲向露意丝）

斐迪南　该死的东西！我说：退回去——我再说一遍！您怜悯怜悯自己吧，爸爸！别逼我走极端！

宰相　（气急败坏地斥责法警）你们就这样恪尽职守？混账东西！

众法警　（猛冲上去）

斐迪南　事已至此——（拔出剑来，砍伤法警数人）只好请你们法律的代表原谅了！

宰相　（怒不可遏）我倒要看看，你这剑是否也会砍在我的身上。（亲手抓住露意丝，拽起她来交给一名法警）

斐迪南　（大声惨笑）爸爸，爸爸，你的行为是对上帝最尖刻的讽刺！他竟善恶不辨，把十足的刽子手变成了堂堂宰相！

宰相　（对其他人）带走她！

斐迪南　爸爸，绑她上耻辱柱吧，但是连同少校，连同宰相的少爷一起！——您还固执己见吗？

宰相　那戏就更有看头，更加有趣喽——带走！

斐迪南　爸爸！为了这姑娘，我宁可放弃少校的佩剑——您还坚持吗？

宰相　剑挂在你那不知羞耻的身上，已经毫无价值！——带走！带走！我命令。

斐迪南　（推开那个法警，一条胳臂搂住露意丝，另一只手举起剑）爸爸！在您让我妻子受辱之前，我决心刺死她——您还坚持吗？

宰相　刺吧，要是你的剑还锋利。

斐迪南　（放开露意丝，怒视空中）万能的主呵，你看见啦！是人想得出来的办法我全已试过——现在不得不用魔鬼的伎俩了！在你们带她去站耻辱柱的时候（凑近宰相的耳朵大声道）——我就向整个京城讲那段您爬上宰相宝座的故事。（下）

宰相　（五雷轰顶似的猛然一惊）你想干什么？——斐迪南！——放了她！（急急追赶少校）





第三幕


宰相府的大厅。





第一场


宰相和秘书伍尔穆上。





宰相　事情搞糟了。

伍尔穆　跟我担心的一样，大人。强迫经常使热恋的人更加铁心，而从来不能叫他们回心转意。

宰相　本来我对这一招信心十足。我断定：一旦姑娘名声扫地，他身为军官便不得不回头。

伍尔穆　完全正确。可问题却在要真的名声扫地。

宰相　不过哩——我现在冷静地思考了一下——我还是不该上他的当——他只不过是威胁一下罢了，大概永远不会动真格的。

伍尔穆　您可别这么想。一个热恋者惹急了什么蠢事都干得出来。您常告诉我，少校先生对您能执政一直摇脑袋。这我相信。他从大学里学来的那些信条，一开始我就觉得不可理解。他那些关于伟大心灵和高尚人格的梦想，在宫廷里能派啥用场？宫廷里最大的智慧不外乎不紧不慢，圆滑机灵，能缩能伸。他年纪太轻，脾气火爆，根本不懂得徐缓、迂回的权术谋略的奥妙，野心勃勃，动辄便追求伟大和冒险。

宰相　（不耐烦）可您这番高论对事情有什么弥补呢？

伍尔穆　我讲这些是给阁下指出问题的症结，也许还有挽救的办法不是。一个那种性格的家伙——恕我冒昧——他绝不能做您的亲信，也不可让他与您为敌。他厌恶您飞黄腾达所采用的手段。到目前为止，也许只是儿子拴住了叛徒的舌头。您要给了他适当的机会和借口，您要是一再伤他的感情，使他认为您不是一个慈爱的父亲，那么，他心中爱国者的责任感便会占上风。是的，仅仅给正义祭坛献上一份绝妙的牺牲这个奇思异想，就足以刺激他亲手打倒自己的老子。

宰相　伍尔穆啊伍尔穆！——你把我领到了可怕的悬崖边上。

伍尔穆　不，我是想把您领回来，大人。允许我怎么想怎么讲吗？

宰相　（坐下）就像一个囚犯对他的同案犯。

伍尔穆　那就请大人海涵——我想，您当宰相完全靠的是圆滑的宫廷艺术，您干吗又不能用它当父亲呢？我记得，当时您是如何好劝歹劝，把您的前任请去玩扑克，并且用上等法国葡萄酒亲亲热热地灌了他半夜；而就在这天夜里，巨大的地雷行将爆炸，那好人必定飞上天——为什么您对令郎又非得摆出一副敌对的架势不可呢？千万别让他知道，我了解他恋爱的底细。从姑娘方面下手去挖它的墙脚，进而控制住您那公子的心。您要像一位聪明的将军似的分化瓦解敌人，而不是去攻击它的中坚核心。

宰相　具体如何行事？

伍尔穆　再简单不过——还有牌在咱们手里嘛。您暂时委屈一下，别摆父亲架子。别去跟痴心的情郎较量，任何阻力都只会使他更加痴傻，更加倔强——把他们交给我，我要用他们的狂热，孵化出吞噬掉这狂热自身的虫子。

宰相　我急欲知道究竟。

伍尔穆　要么我太不懂得人心，要么令郎吃起醋来也十分可怕，就跟他闹恋爱一样。让他对那些姑娘产生疑心吧——不管有没有这回事。一丁点儿酵母，就会引起剧烈反应，将这个罗曼史破坏掉。

宰相　可去哪儿弄这点儿酵母呢？

伍尔穆　现在咱们到了节骨眼儿上啦——首先，大人，您得给我讲清楚，要是少校继续抗拒下去，您将担多大风险？——对您来说，让他结束与一个平民丫头的罗曼史，跟弥尔芙特夫人结婚，究竟重要到了什么程度？

宰相　这还用问吗，伍尔穆？——要是与夫人的婚事吹了，我的整个地位都会动摇；要是我过分逼迫少校，我的脑袋就有危险！

伍尔穆　（兴高采烈）那好，大人，您请听——对少校先生，我们只能用计谋诱使他进入罗网。对那丫头，我们将动用您的全部权威。我们口授一封她给第三者的情书，叫她亲笔写出来；然后，我们巧妙地让信落进少校手里。

宰相　想入非非！好像她一说便通，会马上写下自己的死亡判决书似的？

伍尔穆　她一定会写，只要您让我放手去干。这颗善良的心我了如指掌。它只有两个致命弱点，容易受到我们的攻击——她的父亲和那位少校。少校可以完全不加考虑；正因此，我们就可以更加放手地对付那位乐师。

宰相　具体办法呢？

伍尔穆　根据大人给我讲的在他家已上演的那场戏看，最简单的办法就是威胁她父亲，说要让他吃官司。公爵殿下的宠臣和掌玺官等于是殿下的影子——侮辱他就等于侮辱殿下——至少我要用这纸糊的鬼怪，把那家伙逼得走投无路。

宰相　不过——可别搞得太过火。

伍尔穆　才不会呢——只等把一家人逼上了绝路，便适可而止。也就是说，我们将悄悄地把乐师关起来——为了把情况搞得更严重点，也可以连那母亲也一块儿逮进去——同时就讲对罪行起诉呀，上断头台呀，终身监禁呀什么什么的，而获释的唯一条件，是女儿的那封信。

宰相　好！很好！我明白了。

伍尔穆　她爱她的父亲——我想说——爱得要命。他的生命——至少是他的人身自由——受到了威胁——她的良心将自我谴责，是她招惹了是非——与少校结合又不可能——最后再加她的头脑已被搅昏，这事儿就包在咱身上——十拿九稳——她非掉进陷阱不可。

宰相　可我儿子呢？他会不会马上得到风声？他会不会更加疯狂呢？

伍尔穆　一切让我来操心吧，大人！——在全家赌咒发誓对整个经过保守秘密并承认那封信是真的之前，咱们绝不释放她的父母。

宰相　赌咒发誓？赌咒发誓顶屁用，蠢货！

伍尔穆　对于我们是屁用没有，大人。可对他们那号人，用处大着哩。——您瞧一瞧，咱俩只这么一招就能如愿以偿，有多妙——姑娘失去了少校的爱情和自己清白的名声。父亲母亲垂头丧气，心甘情愿地向命运屈服，这当口儿我才去向他们的女儿求婚，帮她挽回一点儿面子，到头来他们还会感激我对他们发了善心哩。

宰相　（边笑边摇脑袋）真的，我服你啦，恶棍！这一招可算魔鬼的杰作。青出于蓝而胜于蓝喽！——现在的问题是，信写给谁？我们让她和什么人关系暧昧！

伍尔穆　必须是一个由于令郎的决定要么赢得一切，要么输掉一切的人。

宰相　（稍微考虑了一下）我想只能是侍卫长了。

伍尔穆　（耸耸肩膀）要是我叫露意丝·米勒，他自然不合我的口味。

宰相　为什么不？怪了！一套令人眼花缭乱的穿戴——浑身的巴黎香水味儿和麝香味儿——每一句蠢话都换得来大把的金币——这一切还不够叫一个市民丫头垂涎三尺？——呵，老弟，人吃起醋来不会考虑那么多。我这就派人去请侍卫长。（摇铃）

伍尔穆　这事和把提琴师米勒抓起来的事就请大人亲自处理了；我呢，得去起草刚才讲的那封信。

宰相　（踱到写字台前）写好了马上送来我看看。（伍尔穆下。宰相坐在桌旁书写着什么，一名侍从走进来，他站起身递一张纸给侍从）这份逮捕令立刻送到法院去——同时再派个人去请侍卫长来见我。

侍从　侍卫长老爷的车正巧到了门外。

宰相　那更好——不过，告诉下边，仔细准备好后再动手，免得引起骚乱。

侍从　遵命，大人。

宰相　明白吗，一点不能声张？

侍从　明白，大人。（下）





第二场


宰相和侍卫长。





侍卫长　（急匆匆地）只是顺道儿来看看，老伙计！——您怎么样？过得好吗？今儿晚上上演大型歌剧《狄多》[1]——烟火棒极啦——整座城市一起烧起来——您不来看看吗？怎么样？

宰相　我后院里火已烧得够猛啦，眼看会将我的整个荣华富贵化为灰烬——您来得正好，亲爱的侍卫长，有件事正需要您出主意和出力气哩。此事将要么叫咱俩飞黄腾达，要么彻底毁了我和老弟您。坐下谈吧！

侍卫长　别吓唬我，老兄。

宰相　就这么回事——要么飞黄腾达，要么彻底毁灭。您清楚我对我儿子和弥尔芙特夫人的安排。您也明白，对于巩固咱俩的幸福，这样的安排必不可少。一切都可能功亏一篑哟，卡尔勃。我儿子斐迪南不愿意。

侍卫长　不愿意——不愿意——可我已讲遍全城啦！人人都在谈论这桩婚事。

宰相　您将变成一个散布谣言的家伙，在全城的人面前出乖露丑。他爱的是另一个女的！

侍卫长　开玩笑！难道这也算得上障碍？

宰相　遇上了那么个顽固脑袋，简直是最没法克服的障碍。

侍卫长　他竟会这么痴傻，送上门来的幸福都不要？嗯？

宰相　您问他自己去，听他回答您什么吧。

侍卫长　可我的天！他到底能回答什么哟？

宰相　他将向全世界揭露咱俩的罪行，让世人知道咱们是怎样爬上来的——他将告发咱们伪造文书和字据的勾当——他将把咱俩送上断头台——他能回答这一切！

侍卫长　您神经有毛病怎么的？

宰相　这是他的回答。他打定主意这么干——我甚至低声下气地求他，他仍不放弃自己的打算。现在您说吧，怎么办？

侍卫长　（一脸蠢相）我的脑袋不中用了。

宰相　这还不算。我同时还接到我的密探们的报告，御酒监封·波克跃跃欲试，正准备向夫人求婚呐。

侍卫长　您要急死我了。谁，您说？封·波克，您说？——您也知道，我和他可是死对头！您也知道，我们怎样结的仇？

宰相　这我倒想听听。

侍卫长　老伙计！您就听好了，但愿您别坐立不安——如果您还记得宫里那次化装舞会——眼看就是二十年前的事啦——您知道，大伙儿刚跳完第一轮英国土风舞，大吊灯上的蜡烛油便热乎乎地滴了一些在默尔绍姆伯爵带帽兜的长袍上——我的天啊！这您一定还记得！

宰相　这样的事谁忘得了？

侍卫长　对啦！阿玛丽公主正跳在兴头上掉了一条箍袜带——不难想象，这下所有人全慌作一团——封·波克和我——我们那会儿还在当宫内侍从——我俩一起在舞厅中爬来爬去找那袜带儿——终于，我发现了它——封·波克一见马上扑过来——硬从我手中夺走了袜带儿——我请您想一想！——他把它交还给公主，扬扬得意地抢去了本应属于我的一次取宠的机会——您做何感想？

宰相　无耻！

侍卫长　抢去了我取宠的机会！——我差点儿晕倒过去。没见过这样的穷凶极恶！——终于，我鼓起了勇气，踅到公主殿下跟前，说道：“殿下，封·波克真太幸运，能把袜带奉还给您；可那第一个找到袜带的人，却不事声张，只在心眼儿里感到满足。”

宰相　讲得好，侍卫长！再好不过！

侍卫长　不事声张——可我一定要对封·波克报这个仇，哪怕是到了世界的末日——这下流无耻的谄媚者！——而且还不止此呐——在我俩同时扑去捡袜带的一刹那，这狗杂种把我假发右边的香粉蹭了个精光，将我在舞会上的形象完完全全给毁了！

宰相　正是这小子要娶弥尔芙特夫人，从而成为宫里的头号人物。

侍卫长　您给我心里戳了一把刀子。要？要？他凭什么要？怎能说他一定会娶她？

宰相　因为我的斐迪南不愿意，除了他又没别的人来顶替。

侍卫长　可您难道没有任何办法让少校改变主意？——不管事情多么棘手，多么令人绝望！——只要能排除那该死的封·波克，世界上再讨厌的事情咱们现在不是也乐意干吗？

宰相　我只知道一个办法，行不行就看您喽。

侍卫长　看我？什么办法？

宰相　把少校和他的情人拆散。

侍卫长　拆散？您的意思是？——您要我干什么？

宰相　只要使他对姑娘产生疑心，就万事大吉。

侍卫长　让他以为她偷了东西，对吗？

宰相　唉，不是不是！他怎么会相信这个？——要他以为她还和另一个男人有关系。

侍卫长　这另一个男人？

宰相　必须您来当，男爵。

侍卫长　我来当？我？——她是贵族吗？

宰相　干吗是贵族？异想天开！——一个乐师的女儿。

侍卫长　就是说平民喽？这不行。嗯？

宰相　什么不行？笑话！天地间谁会想到查问漂亮脸蛋儿们的祖宗八代，家庭出身？

侍卫长　可请您考虑，一位有妇之夫！还有我在宫里的名声！

宰相　那是另外一回事。对不起，我还不知道，在您看来做品德高尚的丈夫，会比当有权有势的大官更重要。咱们别谈了吧？

侍卫长　请别误会，男爵。我不是这个意思。

宰相　（冷冷地）不——不！您完全有道理。再说呢，我也烦了。我将就此撒手。我祝封·波克荣升宰相。世界上还有的是去处。我向公爵主动辞职。

侍卫长　那我呢？——您说得容易，您！您是位有学问的人！可我算什么？——天呐，要是殿下撤了我，叫我干什么好哇？

宰相　老皇历。死脑筋。

侍卫长　我求您，老朋友，大好人！——快打消这个念头！什么事我都情愿干。

宰相　您愿意借出您的名字，让那个米勒姑娘写封信约您去幽会吗？

侍卫长　以上帝的名义起誓，我愿意！

宰相　愿意在某个一定会让少校看见的场合将信掉出来，对吗？

侍卫长　例如在检阅的时候，我可以假装掏手帕，将信漫不经心地扔在地上。

宰相　并且在少校面前坚持扮演情郎的角色？

侍卫长　得啦得啦！我一定收拾他！我一定扮演个狂热的情郎，把这自以为是的小家伙的胃口倒掉。

宰相　这就对喽。信今天就写好。天黑前您得再来取信，并且和我一起将您的角色琢磨琢磨。

侍卫长　一旦我请完那十四个最最重要的安，立刻就赶来。请原谅，我得马上告辞。（下）

宰相　（摇铃）全靠您的老练狡猾啦，侍卫长。

侍卫长　（扭过头来喊道）嗨，我的天！您还不了解我！





* * *



[1]　《狄多》是17世纪英国作曲家普赛尔所作歌剧，原名《狄多与埃涅阿斯》（Dido and Aeneas）。女主人公狄多系腓尼基公主，因女巫作祟失去了情人特洛伊王子埃涅阿斯而自杀。





第三场


宰相和伍尔穆。





伍尔穆　提琴师和他老婆给逮起来了，非常顺利，一点没有声张。信，大人现在要过目吗？

宰相　（念完了信）妙极了！妙极了，秘书先生！还有侍卫长也上了钩！——像这样的毒药，足以使健康本身变成腐烂化脓的麻风病！——喏，立刻去对那位父亲提出条件，然后趁热打铁再找他女儿去。（两人从不同的方向下）





第四场


米勒家的一间房间。



露意丝和斐迪南。





露意丝　我求求你，别再来啦。我不相信还会有什么幸福的日子。我已经失去我的一切希望。

斐迪南　可我希望的却更多了。我父亲很生气。我父亲会用一切手段对付我们。他将逼得我做个不孝之子。我再不会尽什么儿子的责任。愤怒和绝望将迫使我揭开他谋杀前任的黑幕。儿子将把父亲送到刽子手手中——这叫铤而走险——而且必须铤而走险，如果我的爱情不得不迈出这勇敢的一步的话！——听着，露意丝——有一个想法，伟大、豪迈如我的爱情，它一阵又一阵地撞击着我的灵魂——这就是你，露意丝，还有我和我们的爱情！在这个圆圈里不包含着整个的天空吗？难道你还需要别的第四种什么？

露意丝　行啦，什么也别再说。一想到你想说的那些话，我便会脸色苍白。

斐迪南　对世界我们已毫无所求，干吗还要去乞求它的喝彩？既然已不可能赢得任何东西而只会失去一切，干吗不冒冒险？——这双眼睛不管是倒映在莱茵河中还是易北河中，还是波罗的海，不是同样的温柔、明亮吗？哪儿有露意丝爱我，那儿就是我的祖国。你在荒漠中的足迹，对我来说比我故乡的大教堂更值得欣赏——难道我们还会思念城市的繁华吗？只要哪儿有我俩在，那儿就有太阳升起，太阳落下，露意丝——这壮丽景象将使一切艺术的铺张煊染相形见绌。我们不能再上任何教堂侍奉上帝，夜晚却会在我们的头顶上张开庄严的天幕，盈缺交替的月亮会给我们传播忏悔之道，满天繁星会和我们一起向上帝祈祷。我们的绵绵情话怎么会说得完呢？——我的露意丝嫣然一笑，便足够谈论几个世纪；要体会出你的一滴泪水的含义，生命之梦已做到尽头。

露意丝　难道你除了爱我，不承担任何别的职责？

斐迪南　（拥抱她）保证你的安宁，就是我最神圣的职责。

露意丝　（非常严肃地）那就请你住口，并且离开我——我有一位父亲，他除去我这独生女儿，便一无所有——明天他将满六十岁——他提心吊胆，知道宰相准会对他进行报复……

斐迪南　（迅速抢过话头）让他和我们一块儿走。这样便没啥好说了吧，亲爱的！我马上去变卖值钱的东西，并且从父亲账上提些款子出来。抢夺一个强盗的财物不算犯法；他那许多财产，不都是国家的血泪吗？——半夜打一点时有辆车驶到门口来，你们赶紧跳上车。咱们远走高飞。

露意丝　可你父亲会在背后诅咒我们——这样的诅咒，我的冒失鬼啊，就是杀人犯说出来也总会传到上帝耳边，就是缚在绞刑架上的强盗听了也会视为上天的报应，因而心惊胆寒。这样的诅咒将像幽灵，无情地驱赶我们这些流浪者，从天涯到海角，从此岸到彼岸——不，亲爱的！如果只有罪孽能使我得到你，那我还有失去你的力量和勇气。

斐迪南　（黯然站着，脸色阴沉地喃喃道）真的吗？

露意丝　失去你！——呵，这个想法真可怕得要命——够讨厌的，钻不朽的灵魂的牛角尖，让欢乐的灼热面颊变得苍白冰冷——斐迪南啊斐迪南！我怎能失去你哟？不过，只有占有过的东西才可能失掉，而你的心属于你的等级。——我占有它的想法实属大逆不道和狂妄，因此只好战战兢兢地将它放弃。

斐迪南　（沉下脸孔，咬住嘴唇）你要放弃？

露意丝　不！瞧着我，亲爱的瓦尔特。别那么咬牙切齿的。来！让我以自己作为榜样，拯救你那垂死的勇气。让我暂充一充女中豪杰——把一个浪子送还给他的父亲——放弃这一使市民社会解体，使永恒的公共秩序崩溃的结合。——我是一个罪人——胸中充满了狂妄、愚蠢的渴望——我的不幸实在是我该受的惩罚。让我继续相信它是我作的牺牲吧——这样的妄想令我感到甜蜜和欣慰——你会拒绝给我这点乐趣吗？

斐迪南　（神思恍惚而激愤地抓过一把提琴，准备要拉——突然却扯断琴弦，将琴摔碎在地，爆发出高声的狂笑）

露意丝　瓦尔特！天上的主啊！你怎么啦？振作起来！——这样的时刻需要镇定——这分手的时刻！你有一颗高贵的心，亲爱的瓦尔特。我了解它。你的爱情像生命一般热烈，并且自由不羁、无穷无尽——把它献给一位高贵而显赫的女子吧——她从此将不再艳羡女性中那些最最幸运的人——（忍住眼泪）请你别再来看我——在寂寞的围墙内，轻率地受蒙骗的姑娘将独自悲痛哭泣，没有任何人再管她是否在流泪——我的未来空虚而无望——可是，我仍将不时地去闻那往昔的花束，虽然它已经枯萎。（转过脸去，同时向他伸出颤抖的右手）请多保重，封·瓦尔特少爷。

斐迪南　（跃起身来，恍若大梦初醒）我决心逃走，露意丝。你真不愿跟我走吗？

露意丝　（在房间里侧坐下，双手蒙着脸）我的职责要求我留下，并且逆来顺受。

斐迪南　毒蛇，你撒谎！一定是别的什么拴住了你的心。

露意丝　（音调流露出内心的深沉哀痛）您保留着这样的疑心吧——它也许会使您好受些。

斐迪南　用冰冷的职责克制火热的爱情！——这样的鬼话哄得了我吗！——必定有个情夫叫你恋恋不舍；如果我的疑心得到了证实，你和他都将认识我！（冲出房去）





第五场


露意丝独自一人。



她一动不动地、默默无声在圈椅里斜躺了好一会儿，终于站起来。走到舞台前部，惶惶然四处张望。





露意丝　爸爸妈妈怎么还不回来？——爸爸说只出去几分钟，现在已过了整整五个可怕的钟点——他要是出了事——我该怎么好啊？——我为什么呼吸这样急促紧张？（这时候伍尔穆进了房间，站在里侧，没被察觉）没有什么事儿——纯粹是头脑发烧，疑神疑鬼——一旦我们的心灵受到过度惊吓，眼睛便会在任何一个墙旮旯看见魔鬼。





第六场


露意丝和秘书伍尔穆。





伍尔穆　（走近她）晚上好啊，小姐！

露意丝　上帝！谁在那儿讲话！（转过身，看见了秘书，吓得连连后退）可怕！可怕！我的不祥预感这么快就得到最不幸的应验。（用鄙夷的目光瞅了瞅伍尔穆）您准是找宰相！他已经走了。

伍尔穆　小姐，我找您！

露意丝　那我就奇怪了，您本该到市集广场上去才对。

伍尔穆　为什么偏偏去那儿？

露意丝　去接您的未婚妻呀，从示众台上。

伍尔穆　米勒小姐，您冤枉我了……

露意丝　（欲答又止，转过话头）请问有何贵干？

伍尔穆　我来是受您父亲的委托。

露意丝　（一惊）受我父亲的委托？——我父亲在什么地方？

伍尔穆　在他不情愿待的地方。

露意丝　上帝啊！快讲！我已感到大难临头——我父亲在什么地方？

伍尔穆　在大牢里，既然您一定要知道。

露意丝　（仰面望着天空）有这样的事！竟有这样的事！——在大牢里？为什么在大牢里？

伍尔穆　遵照公爵的命令。

露意丝　公爵的命令？

伍尔穆　他侮辱了公爵殿下，因为他竟敢对殿下的代表……

露意丝　什么？什么？呵，万能的永恒的上帝啊！

伍尔穆　已经决定从严惩处。

露意丝　还没有完哩！还有这个！——当然当然，我心中除去少校之外，还有另外一些宝贵的情感——它也不容忽视——侮辱殿下——老天有眼！呵，快挽救挽救，快挽救挽救我的信仰，它正在失去！——还有斐迪南呢？

伍尔穆　他要么娶弥尔芙特夫人，要么遭受诅咒，被剥夺继承权。

露意丝　可怕的自由选择！——不过——不过，他还是比较幸运。他没有父亲可失去。虽说压根儿没有父亲也够悲哀的！——我父亲犯上有罪——我爱人要么娶夫人，要么受诅咒并失去继承权——真是太了不起啦！完完全全的无赖也算一种完美！——完美吗？不！还有一点欠缺——我母亲在什么地方！

伍尔穆　在感化院。

露意丝　（轻声惨笑）现在完美了！——完美了，我已经无牵无挂——解除了一切义务——不再有眼泪——不再有快乐——不再受到庇护。我也不再需要它们——（可怕的沉默）您也许还有一大堆新闻吧？尽管讲好了。我现在全都可以听。

伍尔穆　发生了的事情，您已经知道。

露意丝　这么说，就不会再发生什么吗？（又安静下来，从头到脚打量着秘书）可怜的人！你干的是件可悲的差使，从中你不可能得到快乐的。使别人不幸已经够可怕，而更可怕的是还得去向他们宣布——对他们唱猫头鹰的不祥之歌，站在一旁看着他们的心在命运的矛尖上战栗不止，鲜血淋漓；看着基督徒们怀疑是否还存在上帝——老天保佑我！即使你看见的因恐怖而滴落的鲜血一滴能换一桶黄金——我也不愿意变成你。——还会怎么样？

伍尔穆　我不知道。

露意丝　您竟不知道？——这桩见不得阳光的差事您害怕说出来声音太响，可您墓穴一般阴沉沉的面孔已告诉我有鬼——还有什么花招！——您刚才说，公爵要从严惩处？您说的从严是什么意思？

伍尔穆　别再问了吧。

露意丝　听着，坏蛋！你这刽子手的门徒，你知道如何拿刀子先慢吞吞割断人家脆弱的手脚，接下来却以假惺惺的怜悯去抚弄、舔舐人家颤抖的心！——我父亲的命运将会怎样！你含笑说出的话语中已藏着死亡；你秘而不宣的事情又会是什么？说出来吧。让我一下子担负起全部重荷，哪怕被压得粉身碎骨也行啊！——等待着我父亲的是什么？

伍尔穆　受刑事审判。

露意丝　可这是什么意思！——我是个无知而单纯的女孩子，听不懂你们那些可怕的外国话。什么叫刑事审判？

伍尔穆　决定生死的审判。

露意丝　（镇定地）多谢您了！（急忙走进隔壁房间）

伍尔穆　（不知所措地站在原地）她要去哪儿？这傻丫头难道要——见鬼！她该不会是——我得赶上去——我必须对她的生命负责。（准备去追她）

露意丝　（披了一件斗篷走回来）对不起，秘书先生，我要锁门了。

伍尔穆　这么急上哪儿去？

露意丝　去见公爵。（欲走）

伍尔穆　什么？去哪儿？（慌慌张张地拉着她）

露意丝　去见公爵。您听不明白吗？去见的就是那个想要人审判我父亲，决定我父亲是死是生的公爵——不！不是他想要——而是他必须让人审判，因为有几个恶棍希望如此；他仅仅把他的威严和他君王的签名，给予了这个所谓犯上作乱案子的审判罢啦。

伍尔穆　（纵声大笑）去见公爵！

露意丝　我知道您笑什么——可我也并不指望在那儿得到怜悯——上帝保佑我！会得到的只有厌恶——只有对我的呼喊声的厌恶。人家告诉我，世上的大人物都不了解悲惨是什么，而且也不屑于了解。我现在就要告诉他，什么叫悲惨——要用死亡的种种扭曲的怪相，给他描绘出悲惨的嘴脸——要用撕心裂肺的钻进他骨髓的叫唤，让他听见悲惨的语言——即使他这时已听得毛骨悚然，我最后还要冲着他耳朵大吼：到了垂死的一刻，就连地上的神灵也一样会喘不过气来；末日审判中用来甄别善恶的，无论对王侯还是对乞丐，将是同一把筛子！（欲走）

伍尔穆　（恶毒而貌似和气地）您去吧，呵，您快去呀。真的，您这样子再聪明不过。我赞成您去，我向您担保，公爵会乐于开恩的。

露意丝　（突然站住）您说什么？——您自己也劝我去？（快步走回房中）嗯？我到底想干啥？连这个人都赞成的，准是件可鄙可恶的事情——您从哪儿知道，公爵会对我开恩？

伍尔穆　因为他会得到报答。

露意丝　报答？难道做一件合乎人道的好事，也可以开出价码吗？

伍尔穆　要说价码呢，漂亮的求情人本身已经足够。

露意丝　（呆呆地立着，随后突然爆出一声喊叫）公正无私的主啊！

伍尔穆　而且我希望，为了救出您父亲，您不会认为公爵的这个价码定得太高吧！

露意丝　（来回疾走，失去了控制）是的！是的！一点不错。你们那些大人物，他们万无一失地躲在堡垒中——躲在将他们与真理隔开的罪孽后面，就像躲在天使们的宝剑背后一样——万能的主啊，救救我！爸爸，你女儿情愿为你而死，可是不愿为了你而与人同流合污。

伍尔穆　对那可怜的孤老头，这大概还是个新闻哩——“我的露意丝，”他对我说，“我的露意丝害我摔了跤。我的露意丝也会把我扶起来……”——赶快把回音带给他吧，小姐。（装着要走的样子）

露意丝　（赶上去拉住他）等一等！等一等！别着急！——在需要折磨人的时候，这魔鬼真叫机灵！——我害他摔了跤。我必须把他扶起来。您说吧！您吩咐吧！我可以做什么？我必须做什么？

伍尔穆　只有一个办法。

露意丝　一个什么办法？

伍尔穆　也是您父亲希望的——

露意丝　我父亲也希望？那该是啥办法呢？

伍尔穆　对您来说轻而易举。

露意丝　对我说来最难莫过于丧失廉耻。

伍尔穆　要是您同意放弃少校……

露意丝　放弃他的爱情？您在取笑我吧？——明明硬逼我这么做，又来问我乐意不乐意！

伍尔穆　不是这个意思，亲爱的小姐。得让少校首先主动退出。

露意丝　他不会的。

伍尔穆　看样子是这样。否则来找您干什么，要不是只有您能促使他那样做？

露意丝　难道我能强迫他恨我不成？

伍尔穆　咱们可以试一试。请坐下。

露意丝　（茫然地）嘿，你捣的什么鬼？

伍尔穆　坐下吧。请您写！这儿是笔、纸和墨水。

露意丝　（极度不安地坐下来）叫我写什么？叫我写给谁？

伍尔穆　写给您父亲的刽子手。

露意丝　哈！你真是个拷打人灵魂的老行家！（抓起笔）

伍尔穆　（开始口授）“亲爱的先生——”

露意丝　（哆哆嗦嗦地写着）

伍尔穆　“难以忍受的三天已经熬过去了——熬过去了——我们没能够见面——”

露意丝　（一怔，放下笔）信是给谁的？

伍尔穆　给您父亲的刽子手呀。

露意丝　我的主啊！

伍尔穆　“为此，您只能怨少校——怨少校——他整天守着我，像百眼巨人阿耳戈斯[1]——”

露意丝　（猛然站起来）卑鄙无耻！有谁听说过！——这封信到底写给谁？

伍尔穆　写给你父亲的刽子手呗。

露意丝　（绞着手指，走来走去）不！不！不！太残酷啦，天啊！如果世人得罪了你，你给他们惩罚吧，可为什么要把我置于进退维谷的可怕境地？为什么要把我夹在死亡与耻辱之间，颠来倒去，受尽折磨？为什么要让这个吸血的恶魔骑在我脖子上，肆意欺凌我？——你们想怎么办就怎么办吧！这信我决不再写了。

伍尔穆　（伸手取帽子）悉听尊便，小姐。写不写完全看您自愿。

露意丝　自愿，您说？看我自愿？——滚，野蛮的家伙！你把一个不幸的人吊在地狱的深渊上边，要求她做件什么事，然后却亵渎上帝，问不幸的人是否自愿！——呵，您再清楚不过，我的心就像拴在铁链上一样，牢牢地被父女之情束缚住了。——其他一切都已经无所谓。继续往下念吧，我什么都不再考虑。对阴险狡诈的地狱，我认输了。（重新坐下）

伍尔穆　“整天守着我，像百眼巨人阿耳戈斯”——这句写好了吗？

露意丝　往下念！往下念！

伍尔穆　“昨天，宰相上我家里来了。看见好心的少校拼命维护我的名誉，我心里直乐……”

露意丝　呵，妙，妙！太高明啦！——只管往下念。

伍尔穆　“我假装晕倒过去——晕倒过去——怕的是会笑出声来”——

露意丝　呵，天哪！

伍尔穆　“可这假面具戴着实在难受——实在难受——真恨不得马上逃走”——

露意丝　（停下笔，站起身，低着头来回地走，好似在地上寻找什么，然后又坐下去继续写）“恨不得马上逃走”——

伍尔穆　“明天他值勤——注意他啥时候离开我这里，然后您就去我俩那个地方”——“我俩那个”写上了吗？

露意丝　一字不差。

伍尔穆　“去我俩那个地方找您温柔的……露意丝吧”——

露意丝　现在还差收信人。

伍尔穆　“致宫廷侍卫长封·卡尔勃大人。”

露意丝　永恒的主啊！我从来没听见过这个名字，就像我的心从来没想到过这些可耻的勾当。（站起来，呆呆地凝视着自己写的东西好半天，临了儿还是把它递给秘书，嗓音嘶哑地，气息奄奄地）拿去吧，我的先生。我现在交给您的——是我清白的名字——是我的斐迪南——是我生命的全部欢乐！——现在我已成了一无所有的乞丐！

伍尔穆　嗨，没的事儿，别灰心，亲爱的小姐。我打心眼儿里同情您。也许——谁知道呢？——也许我仍然可以不计较某些事——真的！上帝做证！我同情您。

露意丝　（目光直瞪着他，像要把他看穿似的）得啦，先生，别说出来，您正在转的念头太可怕。

伍尔穆　（打算吻她的手）要是这只可爱的小手……怎么样，亲爱的小姐？

露意丝　（庄严地，厉声地）当心我在新婚之夜掐死你，然后再心满意足地自行走上绞架！（打算离开，但马上又走回来）先生，我们现在清账了吗？小鸽子可以飞走了吗？

伍尔穆　还有一点点小事，小姐。您必须当着我的面去教堂发誓，承认这封信是自愿写的。

露意丝　上帝啊！上帝啊！难道你必须亲自给这地狱的杰作打上封印，以便它完美无缺吗？（被伍尔穆强拉下场）

第四幕


宰相家的大厅。





第一场


斐迪南手里拿着封已拆开的信冲进门来，一名侍从从另一道门上。





斐迪南　侍卫长在这儿吗？

侍从　少校先生，宰相大人正在找您。

斐迪南　见鬼！我问你侍卫长来了吗？

侍从　侍卫长老爷在楼上玩儿牌。

斐迪南　叫这混蛋赶快下来见我！（侍从下）





第二场


斐迪南独自飞快地读完信，一会儿呆若木鸡，一会儿绕室狂奔。





斐迪南　不可能。不可能！在这天使一般的躯体内，不可能藏着一颗魔鬼的心……可事实却明摆着！明摆着！就算所有的天使都下到人世，为她的清白担保——就算天和地，就算造物和造物主都聚集起来，为她的清白担保——这可是她的亲笔信呀！——闻所未闻的无耻欺骗，人类从来不曾经历过的欺骗！——这就是为什么她死也不肯逃走！——为的就是这个——上帝呵！——现在我算醒悟啦，现在对我才算真相大白！——就为这个，她才大大方方地放弃了我对她的爱情；我差一点，差一点就受了她那天使的假面具的蒙蔽！（越奔越快，最后又停下来静静地沉思）完全摸透了我！——我的每一次感情冲动，每一声心灵震颤，每一回热血激荡，都得到了回应——凭一声细微到极点的无法描述的叹息把握我的心境——用一滴泪水测算出我的感情——伴随我攀登上热情的座座险峰，当我快坠入可怕的深渊时突然出现在眼前——上帝啊！上帝啊！这一切难道仅仅是假象？——假面具？——呵，要是谎言的色泽能这般经久不褪，又怎么可能没有魔鬼混进天国里去呢？

当我指出我们的爱情已处于危险中的时候，这虚伪的女人一下子便脸色苍白，装得真是太像啦！对我父亲的无礼讥嘲，她像个高傲的胜利者似的不屑搭理，可在这一瞬间，这娘儿们似乎也心虚了——不是吗？她到底经受不住真理的严峻考验——这伪善的女人晕倒了过去。你现在还能说什么呢，感情？连淫妇也晕倒了啊。你用什么来替自己辩解呢，贞操？——连婊子也晕倒了啊。

她知道，她已把我变成了什么样子。她看透了我的整个灵魂。在第一次亲吻时我满脸通红的一刹那，我的目光已彻底地展示了我的心——她难道会毫无感觉？或许她仅仅感觉到了胜利的喜悦？——在幸福陶醉的时刻，我幻想她心里装着整个天国，最狂野的愿望也沉默下来了——我心头除去永恒的天国和这个姑娘，别无其他念头——上帝啊！她竟一点没感觉到吗？她唯一感到的，就是她的诡计得逞了吗？就是她卖弄风情赢得了青睐，因而扬扬得意吗？死也要报这个仇！没有别的原因，只为我受骗了吗？





第三场


侍卫长和斐迪南。





侍卫长　（小步跑进房来）您叫人找我吗，亲爱的——

斐迪南　（喃喃自语）我要扭断一个流氓的脖子！（提高嗓音）侍卫长，这封信想必是您在检阅时从口袋里掉出来的——我呢，（冷笑）很幸运地把它给捡到了。

侍卫长　您？

斐迪南　一个太有趣的巧合。您追究万能的上帝的责任去吧！

侍卫长　您瞧，男爵，您把我吓成了啥样子。

斐迪南　念一念吧！念一念吧。（离开侍卫长）既然我不够资格做个情人，那就不如心甘情愿地为你们搭桥拉纤。（趁侍卫长念信的时候，走到墙边取下两支手枪）

侍卫长　（将信扔在桌子上，准备溜走）该死！

斐迪南　（拽住胳臂将他拉回来）慢着，亲爱的侍卫长。这些新闻我觉得挺有趣。再说，我还没有得到捡信人的酬劳哩。（把枪递给他）

侍卫长　（惊愕，后退）请您理智点，亲爱的。

斐迪南　（声音大而可怕）我太理智了，所以决心把你这样的流氓送到另一个世界去。（硬塞一支枪在他手里，同时从口袋里掏出一张手绢）拿着！抓住这张手帕！——它是我从那婊子手里得到的。

侍卫长　以手帕为界决斗？您疯了吗？瞧你想到哪儿去啦！

斐迪南　抓住这一头，我说。不然你会射偏的，胆小鬼！——瞧他抖得多厉害，这个懦夫！你应该感谢上帝，懦夫，他将让你后脑勺第一次尝到枪子儿的滋味。（侍卫长拔腿溜走）等一等！我请你啦。（赶到他前边，拴上门）

侍卫长　在房子里决斗，男爵？

斐迪南　好像和你也值得跑到城外去似的！——宝贝儿，在房里枪声会更加响亮，这可是你在世界上发出的空前绝后的声音呀——举起枪来吧！

侍卫长　（擦拭额上的汗水）难道您打算拿您宝贵的生命来冒险吗，前程远大的年轻人？

斐迪南　瞄准，我说！在这个世界上，我已别无所求。

侍卫长　可我求的还多着哩，我最最杰出的朋友。

斐迪南　你，奴才？你追求什么？——去干世人全都不屑于干的勾当？去不住地点头哈腰，卑躬屈膝，活像只被大头针钉着的蝴蝶？去记录你主子上厕所的次数，对他讲的笑话应声打哈哈？同样地，我也愿意像带着只稀罕的土拨鼠一样带上你，让你像只猴子似的应和着地狱中死鬼们的吆喝声跳舞，狗颠屁股似的奔来跑去伺候他们，用你混迹宫廷的伎俩去娱悦那些永劫不复的罪人。

侍卫长　老爷吩咐小的什么都可以——只是请把手枪放下！

斐迪南　瞧这窝囊废的德行！——真让用第六天造人的上帝感到羞耻！就像迪宾根某个书商粗制滥造的盗印本！——你这脑瓜儿实在不争气，太可惜了它里边那两勺子脑髓，真太可惜！仅仅这点儿脑髓，就足以把一只猢狲变成人，可它现在却只造成理性的破坏——我偏偏得和这样一个家伙分享她的心？——太失格了！太不负责任了！——对这样一个家伙，让他改邪归正还来不及，哪能再刺激他去造孽呢？

侍卫长　呵，感谢上帝，他变聪明了！

斐迪南　我让他配受你的感谢。既然连毛毛虫也得到宽容，就让这家伙也沾点光吧。人家将来碰见他也许会耸耸肩，对上帝的英明发出赞叹，佩服他竟然用残渣和垃圾喂养出了这样一些生物；佩服他竟然给刑场上的乌鸦和皇家厕所里的佞臣准备了餐桌——最后，人们还要惊叹上帝的远见卓识，甚至在地狱中他还豢养了一些以毒攻毒的蝮蛇和蜘蛛——可是，（重新怒不可遏）不许害虫碰我的花朵，要不我就将它（抓住侍卫长猛烈摇晃）如此这般地捏得粉碎。

侍卫长　（自怨自艾）上帝呵！谁离开这里就真有福！离开得远远儿的，就算住进巴黎的疯人院也不错！只要别和这人在一起！

斐迪南　混蛋！要是她不再清白无瑕！混蛋！要是你在我顶礼膜拜的圣地寻花问柳！（狂怒）在我侍奉上帝的天国耽于淫乐！（突然静下来，然后咄咄逼人地）要是你是这样一个混蛋，你就真该早早逃进地狱去还好些，免得在天堂里撞在我的气头上！——你和那姑娘的关系究竟有多深？坦白讲！

侍卫长　请您放开我。我把一切全讲出来。

斐迪南　呵！和这姑娘乱搞，该比尽情地嫖娼宿妓更带劲儿吧！——她愿意放荡，她愿意她能够贬低灵魂的价值，以淫乐冒充德行。（用手枪顶住侍卫长胸口）你和她究竟有什么关系？要不我开枪，要不你说出来！

侍卫长　什么关系也没有——真的什么关系也没有。请您哪怕忍耐一分钟。您上当受骗啦。

斐迪南　用得着你来提醒我吗，恶棍？——你和她关系有多深？说，要不我杀了你！

侍卫长　我的上帝！我的上帝！我说就是了——您只管听着吧——她父亲——她的亲生父亲——

斐迪南　（狠狠地）把他女儿拉来和你姘在一起？那么你和她已经到了什么程度？说，不说我要你的命！

侍卫长　您疯了。您听不进我的话。我从没见过她，也不认识她。我压根儿不了解她的情况。

斐迪南　（连连后退）你从没见过她？也不认识她？压根儿不了解她的情况？——米勒姑娘为你失去了清白，你却一口气对她说三个不？——滚，坏蛋！（用枪揍他一下，把他推出房间）这样的人不值得浪费火药！





第四场


斐迪南独自一人，久久地缄默无语，脸上的表情表明他正经历着可怕的思想斗争。





斐迪南　完了！是的，不幸的人！——我是不幸，你也一样。是的，伟大的上帝做证！如果我完了，你也完了！世界的裁判者呵，别夺去她，这姑娘是我的。为了她，我可以把你的整个世界让给你，情愿放弃你的整个美妙绝伦的创造。把姑娘留给我吧。——世界的裁判者呵，那边有千百万的灵魂在对你哀哀求告，转过你怜悯的目光去吧——让我独自料理我的事好啦，世界的裁判者！（狂躁地搓着手）难道富有而万能的造物主会吝惜一个灵魂，而且还是他所创造的最最卑劣的灵魂？——那姑娘是我的！当初，我是她的上帝；现在，我将成为她的魔鬼！（眼睛定定地望着一个屋角）永远和她一起绑在苦刑的巨轮上——眼睛死死盯着眼睛——头发竖立起来冲着头发——连我们空虚的叹息呜咽也融为一体——现在我要再给她一些温存，让她再听听自己那如歌唱一般悦耳的誓言——上帝啊！上帝啊！这样的结合是可怕的——但却永不分离！（准备跑出去，宰相却走了进来）





第五场


宰相和斐迪南。





斐迪南　（退回房中）呵！——爸爸！

宰相　很好，咱们在这儿碰见了，孩子。我来通知你一件叫你高兴的事，亲爱的儿子，一件准会叫你喜出望外的事。咱们坐下来好吗？

斐迪南　（久久地凝视着父亲，然后激动万分地跑上去抓住他的手）爸爸！（吻他的手，同时跪在他脚下）呵，爸爸！

宰相　怎么啦，孩子？快站起来。你的手又烫又哆嗦。

斐迪南　（极其热烈、冲动）原谅我的忘恩负义，爸爸！我是个不孝的逆子。我误解了您的好心。您待我一片慈爱——呵！您要早有先见之明——现在已太迟啦——原谅我！原谅我！给我您的祝福吧，爸爸！

宰相　（装出莫明其妙的样子）站起来，孩子！想一想，你这不是给我打哑谜吗？

斐迪南　米勒那丫头，爸爸——呵，您了解这个人——当时您生气是完全对的，是表现了高尚的慈父之爱——只是爱子心切，方法不当——米勒那丫头！

宰相　别折磨我了，孩子。我恨自己太严厉！我是来请你原谅的。

斐迪南　请我原谅？诅咒我吧！——您的不同意十分明智。您的严厉是对我天大的爱惜——米勒那丫头，爸爸……

宰相　是个高贵而可爱的姑娘——我收回我操之过急的怀疑，她已赢得我的尊重。

斐迪南　（震惊得跳起来）什么？您也？……爸爸！连您也？……可不是吗，爸爸，生就一副纯洁无邪的好模样——爱这样的姑娘，真是太合乎人情了。对吗？

宰相　也可以说：不爱她等于犯罪。

斐迪南　闻所未闻！岂有此理！——以往您可是很能洞悉人心的哟！而且您通常都是用仇恨的眼睛观察他人！——绝无仅有的伪善——这个米勒丫头，爸爸……

宰相　她有资格做我的女儿。我把她的德行看作高贵的出身，我珍视她的美貌如同金子。我的原则对你的爱情低头了——她应该属于你！

斐迪南　（发疯似的冲出房间）绝不！再见吧，爸爸。（下）

宰相　（跟着他）等等！等等！你奔哪儿去？（下）





第六场


弥尔芙特夫人十分豪华的客厅。



夫人和使女索菲走进来。





夫人　这么说你见着她了？她会来吗？

索菲　马上来。她还随便穿着在家时的衣服，准备赶快换一换。

夫人　别告诉我她的任何情况——什么也别讲——要见到这个幸运的人，这个和我可怕地心心相印的女子，我哆嗦得跟个罪犯一样——在接到邀请时她态度如何？

索菲　她好像很吃惊，沉思着，睁大眼睛瞪着我，一声不响。我原本做好了她会推辞的思想准备，谁知她却眼睛一亮，完全出乎我意料地回答说：“您夫人吩咐的，正是我明天要去求她的事。”

夫人　（非常不安）饶了我吧，索菲。可怜可怜我。要是她只是个平凡的女子，我一定会脸红；要是她超出了平凡，我更会胆怯啊。

索菲　可是夫人——您并非心血来潮，贸然接待一位情敌。想一想，您是什么人。让您的出身、您的地位、您的权势，来替您壮胆吧。一颗骄傲的心，定能提高您仪表的端庄和美丽。

夫人　（魂不守舍地）胡说些什么呀，傻瓜！

索菲　（狡黠地）如此看来，今天这些最值钱的宝石在您身上闪闪发光，也许是碰巧喽？还有，您碰巧正好今天穿上了最名贵的衣料缝的裙子——并且在您的房里挤满了仆人和侍者，还要在您宫内最豪华的客厅接待一个市民少女，对吗？

夫人　（气急败坏地走来走去）真该死！真过分！女人看女人的弱点眼睛就跟夜猫子一样！——可我堕落得有多深啊，多深啊，竟让这样个贱人来揭自己的底！

侍从　（走上场）米勒小姐到……

夫人　（冲索菲）走吧，你！退出去！（索菲还迟疑着。语气变得严厉）走！我命令你！（索菲下。在厅内转了一圈）好！很好，我动了气。我就想这样子。（对侍从）叫小姐进来。（侍从下。猛地坐进沙发，摆出个高贵的懒洋洋的姿势）





第七场


露意丝·米勒怯生生地走进来，离弥尔芙特夫人老远便站住了；夫人背冲着她，在对面立着的一面镜子中仔细观察了她好一阵。片刻静场之后。





露意丝　夫人，我听候您的吩咐。

夫人　（朝露意丝转过身来，微微点一点头，疏远而矜持地）啊哈！您来了！——一定是那位——小姐吧——人家怎么叫您来着？

露意丝　（略显不悦）我父亲姓米勒，是夫人派人请他女儿来的。

夫人　对！对！我想起来了——那个穷提琴师的女儿，近来人们常常议论你呐。（停了一会儿，自言自语地）挺有趣的，可还算不上美人儿——（大声对露意丝）走近点儿，孩子。（重新自言自语）眼睛——惯会哭哭啼啼的眼睛，它们多么叫人爱怜啊！（重新大声地）再走近点儿——到跟前来，好孩子。——我想，你怕我吧？

露意丝　（庄重地，以坚定的口吻）不，夫人！我鄙视世人的偏见。

夫人　（自言自语）你瞧瞧，这倔强劲儿她准是从他那儿学来的。（大声）人家向我推荐了你，姑娘。说你进过学校，生活方面的事也在行——好吧。我愿意相信，即使全世界提出异议我也不在乎，对你那热心肠的推荐者我深信不疑。

露意丝　可我不知道什么人会劳神费心，来替我寻求您的庇护，夫人！

夫人　（矫揉造作地）费心地寻求的要么说是求您庇护的人，要么说是庇护您的人。

露意丝　这话我不明白，夫人。

夫人　比表面上看来要狡猾得多！你说您叫露意丝？你多大啦，如果允许我问的话？

露意丝　已满十六岁。

夫人　（迅速站起来）原来如此！十六岁！情窦初开！——恰似一台新钢琴上叩击出的第一响清脆如银的妙音！还有什么更富于诱惑力呢？——坐下，我对您没有恶意，可爱的姑娘——而且他也是初恋——当朝霞和朝霞聚在了一起，有什么好奇怪的呢？（非常和蔼地拉着露意丝的手）说定了，我要成全你的幸福，亲爱的——那不过是一些甜蜜的、稍纵即逝的梦罢了，如此而已，没有别的。（拍拍露意丝的脸颊）我的索菲快结婚了，想让你来接替她——十六岁，长久不了的喽。

露意丝　（恭敬地吻她的手）感谢您的恩典，夫人，可是我不能领你的情。

夫人　（气愤地倒在沙发上）架子真不小哩！——别的跟您一样出身的女孩子要能走进大户人家，高兴都还来不及哩。——你究竟作何打算，高贵的小姐？您这双可爱的小手就不屑于干活儿？您这张略有姿色的面孔就值得您骄傲？

露意丝　我这张面孔，夫人，和我的出身一样，对我来说都不太重要。

夫人　也许你认为美貌永不消失吧？——可怜的丫头，谁给你脑子里塞进了这种想法？——管他是谁呢，总归他都耍了你们两个。这张脸蛋儿并不曾在烈火中炼成金子。你那镜子兜售给你的永久牢固的东西，只不过是一层薄薄的金箔，迟早都不免让你的追求者给抹去的。——到那时，咱们可怎么办？

露意丝　替那个追求者惋惜，夫人，他买了像是金子镶嵌的假宝贝。

夫人　（不理睬对方说什么）一个像你这样年龄的姑娘，她通常同时有两面镜子，一面是真镜子，一面是她的崇拜者——后一面的圆滑奉承，刚好弥补了前一面的直率粗鲁。这个说，脸上有颗丑陋的麻子呐。那个说，胡扯，那是个妩媚动人的酒窝儿。你们好孩子，只有后一个也说了你们才相信前一个；你们就这么不断地跳来跳去，临了就会将两面镜子说的话搞混了哟。——干吗这么死盯着我？

露意丝　请原谅，夫人！——我刚才正要为您这颗灿烂夺目的红宝石痛哭一场，它竟然不了解它的拥有者夫人您是这样起劲地反对虚荣。

夫人　（脸红了）别扯到一边去，丫头！——要不是您那几分姿色，世界上还有什么会妨碍你挑选这个唯一能使你丢掉市民偏见的地方。

露意丝　也丢掉我市民少女的纯洁吗，夫人？

夫人　愚蠢，放肆！就连最粗野的恶棍也没胆量对我们无礼，要不是我们自己纵容他。我倒要看看到底是什么人，有多大面子，有多么高贵！我告诉你，看在你年轻的分上，我才一切都不计较。

露意丝　请原谅，夫人，我还是要鼓起勇气表示怀疑。某些贵夫人的府邸公馆，常常不是进行最荒唐享乐的场所吗？谁又相信一个贫穷的提琴师的女儿，会有这样的英雄气概，敢于投身到那样的瘟疫滋生地，同时又因害怕传染而浑身战栗呢？谁会梦想弥尔芙特夫人会给自己的良心养一只永远赶不走的蝎子，会梦想她会破费大量的钱财，只是为了换得随时会感到羞耻和脸红这个好处呢？——我很坦率，夫人——当您打算去寻欢作乐的时候，看见我您会开心吗？当您尽兴归来时，看见我您受得了吗？——呵，倒不如让我们天各一方——倒不如让我们之间隔着大海——更好一些！——您好好想一想，夫人——清醒的时刻，枯竭的瞬间，会到来的——悔恨的毒蛇会咬噬您的心，那时——您将何等痛苦，特别是面对着一个心地纯善因而总是满脸愉快、宁静的使女。（后退一步）再说一遍，夫人，我请您多多原谅。

夫人　（激动地走来走去）受不了，她敢对我讲这样的话！更加受不了，她竟然讲得对！（走到露意丝跟前，死死盯住她的眼睛）姑娘，你骗不了我。光有思想不会说得这么动情。在这些信条背后，必然隐藏着强烈的欲望；是它，使你把替我干事描绘得格外可恶——使你讲起话来充满火气——（威胁地）我一定要将它揭露出来。

露意丝　（镇定、端庄地）您就揭露好了！可当您轻蔑地用脚踩那被侮辱的可怜虫时，当心造物主也会让它长上刺，好使它能反抗虐待！——我不怕您报复，夫人！——在臭名昭著的绞架上，可怜的女罪人将笑看世界末日到来——我的苦难已经如此深重，就连法律本身也不可能再使它增加半点。（稍停，非常严肃地）你想把我从自己出身的低贱环境中拉出来，我不想细细地分析它——这可疑的恩惠。我只想问，是什么促使夫人您把我当成一个傻瓜，以为我会因为自己的出身而脸红？是什么使您觉得有权来充当我幸福的创造者，还在您弄清楚我是否肯从您手中获取幸福之前？——我已经撕碎在人世间得到欢乐的全部梦想，已经谅解幸福的过早逝去——您干吗还要让我重新想起它们？——在上帝本身已经遮住他造物眼前的亮光，以致他最大的光明天使也不再厌恶黑暗的时候，人干吗还要装得表面慈悲，实际残酷呢？——怎么搞的，夫人，您那炫耀不够的幸福，怎么总爱乞求苦难的羡慕和赞赏呢？——您的欢乐就这么需要绝望来装点吗？——呵，仁慈的主，那您还是让我变成瞎子吧！只有眼睛瞎了，我才可能与野蛮的命运讲和。——昆虫在一滴水里会感到如像在天国一般地快乐幸福；但一当人们告诉它存在大海，大海里有船队在航行，有鲸群在嬉戏，它的那点儿快乐幸福便完了！——您是希望我得到幸福，对吗？（稍停一会儿，随后突然逼近夫人，出其不意地问）那您自己幸福吗，夫人？（夫人愕然地迅速离开。追上去拉起夫人的手，按在夫人胸口上）您这颗心，是否也像您的阶级一样眉开眼笑呢？要是我以孩子的天真无邪——要是我向您的良心发出呼吁——要是我把您当作自己的母亲来问您——您会劝我作这样的交换吗？

夫人　（万分激动地跌进沙发）没听说过！莫名其妙！不，姑娘，不！你在这个世界上见识的还不多，要充当教训者还太年轻。别对我说谎。我分明听出来另一位导师的声音——

露意丝　（目光温柔而锐利地盯着她的眼睛）这就叫我感到奇怪了，夫人；您早已替我安排好一个使女的位置，现在才提到这位导师。

夫人　（跳起来）岂有此理！——就算是吧，既然你不容我回避！我认识他——了解所有情况——了解的比我希望的还多。（突然停住，然后越讲越激动，直至差一点大发雷霆）可是不幸的人，要是你现在还敢——还敢爱他或者让他爱你——我说什么来着？——还敢思念他或者成为他思念的一部分——不幸的人啊！我有权有势——令人生畏——我说话算话，一定叫你完蛋。

露意丝　（镇定地）无可挽回啦，夫人，只要您开始强迫他，想使他不得不爱您。

夫人　我懂你的意思——可我不要他爱我。我决心战胜这该死的热情，克制自己的心，并且也将你的心碾碎。——我要在你们之间设下危岩和深渊一般的障碍；我要让你们头顶上飞翔着复仇女神；我的名字将像一个作祟的幽灵，惊散你们的一次次亲吻；你青春美丽的身体在他的怀抱里，将枯萎干缩成一具木乃伊！——我是不能和他一起得到幸福——可也不允许你和他幸福！——记住，可怜虫，破坏幸福也是一种幸福！

露意丝　是一种幸福，夫人，不过呢，它已让人给您抢走了。别糟蹋自己的心吧。您对我赌咒发誓的那些威胁，您是干不出来的。您不会忍心去折磨一个完全无损于您的女孩，他相反倒与您同病相怜哩——而且，就冲您这股子狂热劲儿，我倒爱您了，夫人。

夫人　（渐渐冷静下来）我现在在哪儿？刚才在哪儿？我让人记住什么？叫什么人记住？——呵，露意丝，高尚的、伟大的、圣洁的灵魂！原谅这个疯女人吧！——我不会伤害你一根毫毛，孩子。说吧，有什么愿望，有什么要求！我要用双手捧着你，做你的朋友，做你的姊妹。——你穷不是吗？——瞧！——（从身上摘下几颗钻石）我要把这些首饰卖掉——把我的衣服、马匹和马车卖掉——卖的钱全部归你，可你得放弃他！

露意丝　（愕然倒退）她是在寻一个绝望者的开心呢，还是真的没参与那残忍的勾当？——哈！这样我倒还可以装装英雄，把自己的无能无奈美化成功德啦。（伫立沉思，过一会儿又走近夫人，拉住她的手，意味深长地凝视着她）夫人，您就把他拿去吧！——我自愿让给您了，这个那帮家伙用地狱的铁钩，从我流血的心上挖走的男子！——也许您自己不知道，夫人，可您践踏了两个相爱者的天堂，拆散了上帝结合起来的两颗心；您毁了一个女孩，她和您一样亲近上帝，一样为他所创造，一样有权享受欢乐，一样曾经赞美过他。可从今以后，她将不再赞美上帝了，夫人！——一只被踩死的虫子的最后挣扎，同样会传到全知全能的上帝耳中——他不会无动于衷的，要是有人扼杀生灵！现在他是您的了！现在，夫人，把他拿去吧！快去投入他的怀抱！拉他走向祭坛！——只是请您别忘了，当你俩在婚礼进行时准备亲吻的一刹那，将有一个自杀女子的冤魂冲进你们中间！——愿上帝慈悲——我实在没别的路走了！（冲出门去）





第八场


弥尔芙特独自站在厅中，目光呆滞地瞪着露意丝冲出去的厅门，震惊得失去了自持；终于，她从神志迷乱中清醒过来。





夫人　我这是怎么啦？怎么回事？那不幸的女孩她说了些什么？——呵，天啦！它们，她那些可怕的、诅咒我的话语还撕扯着我的耳朵：把他拿去吧！她说。——谁呢，不幸的姑娘？你临终喘息的馈赠——你绝望恐怖的遗物吗？上帝！上帝！我已经堕落到这步田地——已经这么突然从所有骄傲自尊的王座上摔下来，以致饿鬼似的渴望着，期待着，要去接受一个女乞丐在垂死挣扎时抛过来的施舍吗？——把他拿去吧！她说话时是那样一种语气，还伴着那样一种眼色——哈！艾弥丽呀艾弥丽！难道你就为此而越出女性的规范？你就必须为此而做人家的姘妇，丧失伟大的不列颠女性的名节，让自己荣誉的大厦在一个低贱的平民女子更高的德行旁倾覆吗？——不，傲慢而不幸的姑娘！不！——艾弥丽·弥尔芙特可以忍受耻辱——可绝不让人辱骂！我也一样有能力放弃。（神情庄严地来回走着）滚开吧，软弱的愁眉苦脸的女人！——别了，爱情甜美的金色的梦境！——从此我要以心胸博大为行动的准绳！——那相爱的一对儿完了，要不就只有我打消心头的欲念，并且让公爵永远将我忘记！（稍停，兴奋地）就这么办！——搬掉可怕的障碍——割断我与公爵之间的一切联系——驱走我心中狂暴的爱情！——德行啊，我要投身你的怀抱！——收留她吧，你的悔过自新的女儿艾弥丽！——哈，我一下子心情多么舒畅！我一下子感到多么轻松！多么高尚！——今天，我就要像落日一般伟大地步下权势的高峰；我的荣华富贵将与我的爱情一道逝去；陪伴我完成高傲的放逐的，仅仅是我的心。（坚决地走向写字台）必须马上就办——立刻就办，免得那可爱的青年再迷住我，重新引起我内心的殊死斗争。（坐下开始写）





第九场


弥尔芙特夫人，一名侍从以及索菲。随后又来了宫廷侍卫长，最后再进来仆人若干名。





侍从　侍卫长奉公爵之命来到，正等候在前厅里。

夫人　（写得正起劲）他会给搞糊涂的，他们木偶似的公爵！诚然，也够异想天开啊，竟这样去剖他那至尊的脑袋瓜儿！——他那班宠幸会变成热锅上的蚂蚁——全国上下将乱作一团。

侍从和索菲　侍卫长，夫人……

夫人　（转过头来）谁？什么？——那更好！这类畜生来到世界上就为的是驮大口袋。请他进来吧。

侍从　（下）

索菲　（怯生生地踅近夫人）我不得不担心，夫人，我这样做近乎放肆——（夫人仍一个劲儿地往下写）米勒那丫头发疯似的冲过前厅——您也满脸通红——自言自语——（夫人继续写着）我害怕——准保会闹出什么乱子来的？

侍卫长　（走进来，冲着夫人的脊背不住地鞠躬，发现她没看见，就踅过去，站在她的椅子背后，轻轻抓起她的裙裾来按在嘴上吻了一下，细声细气地，诚惶诚恐地）公爵殿下他……

夫人　（一边往信上撒沙子同时飞快检查信的内容，一边接过话头）他将怪我忘恩负义呐！——我曾经孤苦伶仃，他把我从苦难中拉扯了出来——从苦难中？——好个令人恶心的交易！——该撕掉你的账单了，骗子！我以终身的耻辱还清了你的高利贷！

侍卫长　（围着夫人转了一圈仍未受到注意）夫人像有点心不在焉——看来我只好鼓一鼓勇气了。（猛地提高嗓门儿）殿下派我来请问夫人，今晚是演法国通俗剧呢还是德国喜剧？

夫人　（笑着站起来）随便哪个都行，我的天使。——顺便请您把这张条子带给公爵当饭后果！（转向索菲）你，索菲，吩咐套好车，并把我的行装全部集中到厅里来——

索菲　（惊惶地退下）呵，天！我不早有预感吗！谁知还会出什么事？

侍卫长　您挺激动吗，夫人？

夫人　这样就可以少装模作样——哈哈，侍卫长大人！这儿将空出一个位置来，拉皮条的该交好运啦！（发现侍卫长在瞟字条）您念吧！您念吧！——我希望，信的内容不仅仅成为两个人之间的秘密。

侍卫长　（念信，夫人的仆役们慢慢在大厅后部聚集起来）“公爵殿下！一纸您随随便便就撕毁了的契约，对我也再不会有约束力了。您的公国民众的幸福，曾是我爱您的条件。三年来我一直在受骗，现在才睁开眼睛。我厌恶您给我淌着您臣民们泪水的恩惠。——我不再报答您的爱，您就把它给予自己哭泣的国家，并向一位不列颠女公爵学习，像她一样怜悯您的德意志人民吧。一小时后，我已在公国境外。约翰娜·诺弗克。”

全体仆役　（吃惊地嘀嘀咕咕）已在公国境外？

侍卫长　（吓得把字条放回桌子上）上帝保佑，我最仁慈的夫人！带信的人和写信的人一样，脑袋恐怕都有危险。

夫人　那就是你的问题了，宝贝儿！——遗憾的是我知道，你们这号人在重复别人念的经时也会噎死！——好吧，我就给你出个主意，把信烤在野味饼里得啦；这样殿下自会在盆子里发现它的——

侍卫长　老天！这样做太放肆！——您考虑考虑，您可是想一想，这会叫大家多么狼狈，夫人！

夫人　（转向聚集起来的仆人们，怀着内心的激动说出下面的话）你们都惊呆了，我的好人们，都惶惶不安地等待着谜底将怎样揭开，是吗？——走近些，亲爱的朋友！——你们侍候我既诚实又体贴，更经常地注意我的眼睛，而不是我的钱袋。你们的奉命唯谨是出于你们的热情，出于你们的骄傲——是对我的恩惠！——可叹啊，怀念你们的忠诚，同时必然想起我的屈辱！悲惨的命运啊，我最黑暗的日子偏偏是你们幸福的日子！（眼里噙着泪水）我现在就辞退你们，我的孩子们——弥尔芙特夫人不复存在，而约翰娜·诺弗克又太穷，无力偿付她欠的债。——我的管账先生将倾我的所有，任随你们瓜分。——这座府邸仍旧属于公爵。你们中最寒碜的，在离开此地时，也将比你们的女主人富有。（伸出手去，众仆役挨个儿上前热烈地亲吻）我理解你们，我的好人们——再见了！永远再见了！（强压悲哀，打起精神）我听见车已经到了。（抽身准备出去，侍卫长急忙拦住去路）可怜的家伙，你还站在这儿？

侍卫长　（一直魂不守舍地盯着字条发愣）要我把这张条子呈到公爵殿下高贵的手里吗？

夫人　可怜的家伙！呈到他那高贵的手里，并且向他高贵的耳朵禀报，因为我不能赤着脚去圣地洛莱托清洗罪孽，我将做一个自食其力的人，以便洗刷掉我曾经左右过他的耻辱。（冲出厅去。其余的人全都激动地各奔东西）





第五幕


黄昏时分，乐师家的一间房间。





第一场


露意丝静静地、一动不动地坐在最幽暗的屋角里，头伏在胳臂上。过了好久，才见米勒提着灯笼走进来，惊惶不安地在屋里照来照去，却没有发现露意丝。随后他摘掉帽子，放在桌上，再将灯笼放下。





米勒　这儿也没有她。这儿还是没有——我跑遍了大街小巷，去过所有熟人家里，每一道城门都问过了——人家哪儿也没见着我的孩子。（沉默良久）得有耐心，可怜而不幸的父亲。等着吧，等到明天再说。也许你的独生女儿到时候就游到岸边来了——上帝啊！上帝啊！是我的心太眷念这个女儿，把她当神一般对待了吗！——你的惩罚太重啦，天父啊，太重啦！我不想抱怨，天父，可惩罚太重啦。（痛苦不堪地倒在一把椅子上）

露意丝　（在屋角里说）你做得对，可怜的老爸爸！你还得及时学会失去哟。

米勒　（一跃而起）是你吗，我的孩子？你在这儿？——干吗这么孤零零的，灯也不点？

露意丝　我并不因此孤独。正因为我周围一片黑暗，才会有贵客上门。

米勒　上帝保佑你！只有良心的蛀虫才迷恋猫头鹰，罪孽和鬼魅都害怕光明。

露意丝　还有永劫，爸爸，还有无须任何帮助便与灵魂对话的永劫。

米勒　孩子！孩子！你这是些什么话呀？

露意丝　（站起来往前走）我刚经历了一场激烈的斗争，上帝清楚，爸爸。是他给了我力量。胜败已经决定了，爸爸！世人总说我们女性是娇嫩的，脆弱的。别再相信这种话。在一只蜘蛛面前我们是会吓得发抖；可那带来腐烂和毁灭的黑色巨魔，我们却可以玩儿似的搂进怀里。这就是我要告诉你的，爸爸。你的露意丝快活着哩。

米勒　听着，女儿！我倒希望你大哭一场。这样子，我会更加喜欢。

露意丝　我多想斗败他啊，爸爸！我多想骗过那个暴君啊，爸爸！——爱情比心肠狠毒更狡猾和大胆——他不懂得这个道理，那个倒霉的家伙。——呵，他们是够奸刁的，在他们仅仅对付头脑的时候；可一当他们要对付人心，这些恶棍就愚蠢起来了！——他竟想以一句誓言替他的骗局保险！誓言也许能束缚住活人，爸爸，可人一死，连宣誓的铁链也会熔化。到那时，斐迪南会理解他的露意丝。——你愿意替我送封信吗，爸爸？你愿意行行好吗？

米勒　送给谁，我的女儿？

露意丝　问得好怪！无限的宇宙和我的心加在一起，也不够容纳我对他唯一的思念。——我还能向别的什么人写信呢？

米勒　（不安地）听着，孩子！我要拆开这封信。

露意丝　随你的便吧，爸爸——可你什么也不会明白的。字母就像冷冰冰的死尸似的躺着，唯有爱情的眼睛才富于生气。

米勒　（念信）“你被出卖了，斐迪南——一个没有先例的阴谋扯碎了我俩的同心结，可怕的誓言又封住了我的嘴；你父亲到处安排有他的密探。然而，亲爱的，你要是有勇气的话——我还知道第三个地方，那儿誓言不再有约束力，任何密探也闯不进来。”（停住，严肃地凝视着她的脸）

露意丝　干吗这样瞅着我？念完呀，爸爸！

米勒　“可你必须鼓足勇气穿行黑暗的街道，在那儿给你光明的唯有你的露意丝和上帝——你只需带来你的爱，其他的一切希冀和渴望，你通通可以留在家里；在那儿，你只需要你的心。你要愿意——那就启程吧，在卡美尔派修道院的钟楼敲十二点的时候。你要胆怯——那就从你们男人的称谓前划去‘坚强’这个词，因为一个姑娘叫你蒙受了羞耻。”（米勒放下信，目光沉痛、呆滞地久久凝视着前方，好久才转过身来对着露意丝，嗓音低沉嘶哑地）什么第三个地方，孩子？

露意丝　你不知道它。你真的不知道吗，爸爸？——奇怪！这个地方说得很清楚，斐迪南会找到的。

米勒　唔！再讲清楚点！

露意丝　对它我偏偏想不起什么可爱的称呼。——你千万别害怕，爸爸，要是我说出难听的来。这个地方——这个情人们本该给它取一个最动听的名字的地方，呵，不知为什么他们却没想出好名字！这第三个地方哟，好爸爸——你可得让我说完呀——这第三个地方叫坟墓。

米勒　（歪歪倒倒地走向一把圈椅）我的上帝啊！

露意丝　（赶过去扶住他）可别这样，爸爸！仅仅是围绕这个称呼聚集起了许多恐惧的缘故——撇开这个称呼，在它里边摆放着新娘的寝床，床顶上铺展开了锦缎般的朝霞，还有年复一年的春天悬挂的五彩花环呐。只有大哭大叫的罪人才会骂死是一堆白骨；它其实是个甜蜜可爱的小男孩，容光焕发如世人画的小爱神，但却不像爱神似的刁钻古怪——死是一个沉静而乐于助人的精灵，它越过时间的鸿沟，伸出手臂迎接疲惫不堪的朝圣女子，为她的灵魂开启永恒的灿烂辉煌的仙宫，亲切地对她点着头，然后隐去。

米勒　你想干什么，我的女儿？——你想擅自戕害你的生命吗？

露意丝　别这么讲，爸爸。逃避一个容不下我的社会——提前到一个我迟早得去的地方——这难道也算是罪孽？

米勒　自杀是再可恶不过的了，孩子——是唯一无法追悔的罪孽，因为它将死亡与犯罪结合在一起。

露意丝　（呆立着）可怕呵！——不过不会这么快。我打算跳进河中，爸爸，我将在沉下去时祈求全能的上帝怜悯我。

米勒　这就是说，你要在赃物藏好后才来忏悔你的偷窃罪——孩子！孩子！当心啊，别愚弄上帝，当你最需要他的时候！呵，瞧你已经走得有多远，有多远！——你放弃了祈祷，仁慈的主已经收回他持有你的手。

露意丝　爱难道犯罪吗，爸爸？

米勒　如果你爱上帝，你就绝不会爱到犯罪的地步——你害得我头垂腰弯，我唯一的宝贝儿！深深地，深深地，也许已经接近坟墓。——得啦！我不想使你心情更加沉重，孩子！刚才说了点什么。我以为房里只我一个人。你已经听见了，我何必再保什么密呢？你曾是我崇拜的女神。听着，露意丝，只要你心中还有一点对父亲的体贴——你曾经是我的一切啊！现在你别再浪费你的财富了。我也可能失去一切啊！你瞧，我的头发已开始花白。对我来说，已经到了做父亲的该从儿女心中收回投资和红利的时候了。你想要剥夺我的这种权利吗？你想带上你父亲的全部财富一去不返吗？

露意丝　（异常激动地吻他的手）不，爸爸！我将带着对您的重债离开这个世界，到了永恒的彼岸再加倍偿还你。

米勒　注意啊，孩子，可别失算！（非常严肃和庄重地）在彼岸我们还可能重逢吗？——瞧，你脸色变得多么苍白！——我的露意丝自己也已明白过来，在那个世界我不可能再赶上她，因为我还不会像她似的急急忙忙地上那里去。（露意丝扑进他怀里，浑身战栗。他热烈地搂着她，用哀求的声调继续说）呵，孩子！孩子！我也许已经失去了你，走向死亡的女儿！记住我这做父亲的认真的话吧！我不可能时刻守着你。我可以搜走你的刀子，你却能用一根别针杀死自己。我可以防止你服毒，你却能用一串珍珠将自己勒死。——露意丝——露意丝——我还能做的，只是对你发出警告。——你愿意冒险尝试一下，让你那不可靠的幻想在时间与永恒之间的可怕小桥上，将你背弃吗？你愿在全能全知者的座前，鼓起勇气撒谎说“主啊，为了你的缘故，我来了”吗？——到那时，你有罪的眼睛将四处搜寻你的傀儡躯壳；你头脑中臆造的脆弱上帝也将像你一样，跟蛆虫似的在你的审判者脚下蜷曲着身子，在那进退失据的时刻揭穿你自以为是的亵渎神圣的假话，打掉你对永恒的慈悲的幻想——这样的慈悲，是一个罪人根本不可能乞求到的——到那时，你该怎么办啊？（加重语气，提高嗓门儿）你怎么办，不幸的孩子？（将她搂得更紧，呆呆地盯了她好一会儿，然后迅速离开她）现在我再不知道说什么了——（举起手臂）主啊，我不再替你照管这个灵魂！去吧，你想干什么干什么。去为你那高个儿青年做出牺牲，你的魔鬼会因此欢呼狂叫，你的天使却将退避三舍。——去呀！背起你的全部罪孽，并且将你这最后的也是最可怕的罪孽加上；要是你还嫌太轻，那就让我的诅咒给你凑足分量吧！——这儿是一把刀——戳穿你的心，还有——（同时号啕大哭，准备冲出门去）——这颗父亲的心！

露意丝　（赶紧追上去）等一等！等一等！我的爸爸！慈爱比暴君的愤怒更加专横！——叫我怎么办？我不能够啊！我该怎么办？

米勒　要是你感到那少校的亲吻，比你父亲的眼泪还要灼热——死去吧！

露意丝　（经过激烈的思想斗争，然后颇为坚定地说）爸爸！握住我的手！我愿——上帝啊！上帝啊！我这是干什么！我打算干什么？——爸爸，我发誓——我真该死，真该死！我这有罪的人，我偏想到哪边了呵！——爸爸，行啦！——斐迪南——上帝明鉴！——我这就彻底消除对他的记忆。（撕碎她那封信）

米勒　（大喜过望地冲上去搂住她的脖子）这才是我的女儿！——望着我！你摆脱了一个爱人，成全了一个幸福的父亲。（又是笑又是哭地搂着她）孩子！孩子！我真不配活到这样一天！上帝知道，我这坏老头怎么得到了你——我的天使！——我的露意丝，我的天国！——上帝呵，我不大懂得爱情，但放弃它必定是很痛苦的，这我还能理解。

露意丝　离开这个地方吧，爸爸——离开这座城市；在这儿我的女伴们会嘲笑我，我的好名声已经永远失去——走吧，走吧，远远地离开这个地方，在这里处处可以看见我失去了的幸福的痕迹——离开它，只要可能——

米勒　你愿上哪儿都行，我的女儿。世界无处不生长上帝赏赐的食粮，无处没有他的耳朵在聆听我拉琴。是的，让一切都成为过去吧！——我要让琴弦述说你哀痛的故事，我要唱一支赞美女儿的歌曲，她为敬重她的父亲而撕碎了自己的心——我们唱着这支歌挨家挨户乞讨；从那些感动得掉泪的人手里得来的面包，将别有一番滋味。





第二场


斐迪南和前场人物。





露意丝　（先看见斐迪南，惊叫一声，奔过去紧紧搂着父亲的脖子）上帝！他来啦！我完了。

米勒　哪儿？谁？

露意丝　（背转脸，指指少校，将父亲搂得更紧）他！他本人！——你回过头瞧瞧吧，爸爸——他要来杀我了。

米勒　（看见了斐迪南，往后退几步）怎么？您来了，男爵？

斐迪南　（慢慢走近，始终面对着露意丝，用审视的目光紧盯着她，过了一会儿才说）感到惊异的心地善良的小姐，多谢了！您的自白诚然可怕，却也直率而确切，省得我受痛苦折磨。——晚上好，米勒。

米勒　看在上帝分上！您到底要干什么，男爵？您来寒舍有何贵干？这样突然闯来究竟是什么意思？

斐迪南　可曾几何时，有人还把一天的光阴以秒计算，还把对我的思念挂在钟摆上以加快它的速率，还对我出现的一刹那急不可待得心儿怦怦跳动——怎么搞的，现在竟一下子成了突然闯来？

米勒　您走吧，您走吧，男爵——要是您心里还剩有一星半点儿人性——要是您还不想扼杀她，这个您说您爱她的女孩！我求您了，求您马上离开。只要您一踏进我的家，我们的幸福便完了。您给我家招来祸患，早先它却只有欢乐。您难道还不满意吗？我的独生女儿由于认识您而遭到不幸，您难道还要来拨弄她心上的伤口吗？

斐迪南　好个莫名其妙的父亲！我现在来，是要向令爱报告好消息！

米勒　大概是有了新的绝望的希望吧？——走呵，灾星！你那面孔已告诉人你没安什么好心。

斐迪南　实现我希望的机会终于到了！弥尔芙特夫人，我们爱情最可怕的障碍，此刻已逃离公国。我父亲同意了我的选择。命运认输了，遂了我俩的意。我们的幸福之星已经升起！——我来是兑现自己的诺言，领我的新娘去祭坛前举行婚礼呐！

米勒　你听见他了吗，女儿？你听见他奚落讥笑你的失望了吗？呵，真的，男爵！您这位诱惑者真叫惬意，干了坏事还可以卖弄小聪明。

斐迪南　你以为我在开玩笑吗？以我的名誉担保，不是的！我的话千真万确，就像我对露意丝的爱情；我视我的誓言为神圣，就像她遵守它一样。——我不知道还有什么更神圣的了——你还怀疑吗？在我美人儿的双颊上还没有快乐的红晕出现吗？这就怪了，真话在这儿难于取信，谎言肯定已成为家常便饭。你怀疑我的话，那这白纸黑字总该相信了吧。（把露意丝给侍卫长的信扔给她）

露意丝　（展开信，脸色惨白地倒下）

米勒　（未注意到露意丝，对少校）这是什么意思，男爵？我真不明白您！

斐迪南　（将他带到露意丝跟前）可我却十分清楚她！

米勒　（蹲到女儿身边）呵，上帝啊！我的孩子！

斐迪南　苍白得像死亡一样！——这样子才真叫我喜欢，您的女儿！她从来没有像现在这么漂亮过，您这虔诚的诚实的千金！——面孔像死尸一样——末日审判的嘘息能抹去任何诺言的涂漆表面，也吹掉了她脸上的脂粉；本来，凭着她的打扮，这妖精连光明天使也骗得过哟。——现在她的脸蛋儿再美不过！现在她第一次露出了真面目！让我来吻吻她吧。（准备向露意丝走去）

米勒　走开！滚！别来刺一个父亲的心，小子！我没能保护她不受你的调戏，却能保护她免遭你的虐待！

斐迪南　你想干什么，老头儿？我跟你没事儿。别掺和进这显然已经输了的赌博不好吗？——或者你比我想象的还要聪明一些？你已将六十岁的智慧投资到你女儿的风流营生中，并用拉客的勾当玷污了自己的白发？——呵！要是并非如此，不幸的老人啊，那就倒下死掉吧，还来得及！你还可以在咽气时甜蜜而陶醉地想：我曾是个幸福的父亲！——再过一会儿，你就得将这条毒蛇扔回它在地狱的老家，并且诅咒你所获得的这件礼物和它的赠予者，带着对上帝的亵渎走进坟墓里去。（对露意丝）说吧，倒霉的女人！这封信可是你写的？

米勒　（对露意丝，警告地）看在上帝分上，孩子！别忘了啊，别忘了啊！

露意丝　呵，这封信，爸爸……

斐迪南　它落进了不该落进的手里，是吗！——赞美天意的偶然，它完成了比自作聪明的理智更伟大的业绩，到末日审判时会比所有智者的机智更经得起考验——偶然吗，我说？——呵，即使是一只麻雀从天上掉下来，也有天意在起作用，一个魔鬼被揭露，又何尝不是这样呢？——我要求回答！——你写这封信了吗？

米勒　（在一旁哀求她）坚定些！坚定些，孩子！只要再说一声“是”，一切便过去了。

斐迪南　有趣！有趣！连父亲也骗了。所有人通通骗了！现在瞧啊，瞧她那德行，这可耻的女人。现在连她的舌头也不再听使唤，也不肯替她说出最后的谎话！向上帝发誓！和真实得可怕的主起誓！你写这封信了吗？

露意丝　（经历着极其痛苦的思想斗争，同父亲不断地交换眼色，然后坚定地、一了百了地）我写了！

斐迪南　（惊得呆住了）露意丝！——不！我拿灵魂担保，你在撒谎！——即使纯洁无邪的人，在严刑拷打下也会承认他不曾犯过的罪行。——我追问得太凶了，不是吗，露意丝！——你是因为我追问得太凶了才承认的，是吗？

露意丝　我承认事实。

斐迪南　不，我说。不！不！你没有写！根本不是你的笔迹！——就算像，难道模仿笔迹会比破坏心灵更困难吗？对我讲真话吧，露意丝！——或者不，不，别说实话！你可能会讲“是的”，你一讲我也就完了。——一句谎言，露意丝——一句谎言——无论怎样的都行啊，你只要又以天使般坦诚的神态对我讲出来，只要能说服我的耳朵，我的眼睛，只要能卑鄙地蒙骗我的心——呵，露意丝！就让一切的真理从此随着它飞到九霄云外去吧！就让善良正直从此对宫廷卑躬屈膝、俯首帖耳吧！（用畏葸和颤抖的声音）你写这封信了吗？

露意丝　上帝做证！可怕的真实的主做证，写了！

斐迪南　（呆了一会儿，表情极为沉痛）婆娘！婆娘！——你现在竟让我看这样一副嘴脸！——凭着它你就算答应给人家天堂，你甚至在地狱里也休想找到乐于光顾的人了。——你知不知道，你对我曾经是什么，露意丝！不可能！不会的！你不知道，你曾经是我的一切！一切啊！——一切，这是个平庸而无足轻重的字眼儿；可要围着它转一圈，上帝也会感觉吃力；各个宇宙体系的轨道，也完全在它里边——一切啊！可你却这么可恶地玩弄它——呵，太可怕了！

露意丝　你已经叫我承认了，瓦尔特先生。我自己诅咒了自己。这下您走吧！离开这所使您感到如此不幸的房子吧！

斐迪南　好！好！现在我平静下来了——流行过瘟疫的可怕地方也是平静的嘛，人家说——我也一样。（沉吟片刻之后）还有一点请求，露意丝——最后的请求！我头烧得厉害，需要凉一凉——愿意给我兑一杯柠檬汁吗？（露意丝下）





第三场


斐迪南和米勒。



两人互不搭理，各在房间的一侧踱来踱去。





米勒　（终于停下来，神情哀伤地打量着斐迪南）亲爱的男爵，我向您承认，我打心眼儿里为您难过，这也许能减轻一些您的气恼吧？

斐迪南　就算这样好了，米勒。（又走了几步）米勒，我几乎一点想不起来，当初我怎么走进了您的家——为的是什么事情？

米勒　怎么，少校先生？您不是想跟我学吹长笛吗？你一点儿记不起了？

斐迪南　（急忙抢过话头）我见到您的女儿。（又停了好一会儿）您说话不算话，朋友。我们原该演奏宁静的乐曲，打发我寂寞的时光，您却欺骗我，卖给我了蝎子。（见米勒已开始激动，赶紧说）不！别害怕，老人家。（感动地搂住他脖子）您没有责任。

米勒　（擦拭眼睛）全能全知的上帝清楚！

斐迪南　（重新踱来踱去，堕入忧郁的沉思）真怪啊，上帝竟这么莫名其妙地和咱们开玩笑。在一些几乎瞧不见的细线上，常常悬挂着可怕重荷——人怎么知道，咬这个苹果一口就吞食了死亡，嗯？——怎么知道？（越走越急，然后突然抓住米勒的手，异常激动地）我说老头儿啊，为跟您学一点儿笛子，我付出的代价可太大了——而您竟一无所获——您也会输掉——也许输掉一切。（抑郁地从米勒身边走开）该死的学吹长笛，永生永世不该产生这个念头！

米勒　（极力掩饰着感情）这柠檬汁也兑得太久了。我想，您要是不见怪，我去看一看？

斐迪南　不急，亲爱的米勒。（自言自语地）对父亲更是——您只管留下吧——我有什么要问您来着？——对了！——露意丝是您独生女儿？除了她您就没有孩子吗？

米勒　（亲切地）再没有了，少校——也不想再有。这丫头恰好占完我这颗父亲的心——我已把全部现存的爱倾注在女儿的身上。

斐迪南　（大为震动）嗨！——您还是去看看饮料好些，亲爱的米勒。（米勒下）





第四场


斐迪南独自一人。





斐迪南　独生女儿！——你明白吗，凶手？独生女儿！凶手！你听见了吗，单单一个？——这老人在茫茫人世上别无所有，只有一把琴，一个女儿——你竟想给他抢走吗！抢走！抢走叫花子的最后一个子儿？——将瘫痪者的拐杖折断，扔回到他脚下？怎么样？我也有胆量干这种事吗？——事后，他匆匆赶回家来，急不可待地要从他女儿的脸上找到他全部的喜悦，一进门却见她躺在地上，一朵鲜花——枯萎了——死了——遭到了践踏，这最后的、唯一的、无比珍贵的希望！——嗨，他会站在她跟前，会站在那儿，会突然感到整个大自然停止了呼吸；他呆滞的目光会无所畏惧地扫过杳无人迹的无边宇宙，会去寻找上帝，可上帝再也找不到了，回来时更觉渺茫空虚——主啊！主啊！——然而，我的父亲不也就我这个独生儿子嘛！唯一的儿子，却并非唯一的财富。——（停了一会儿）这算什么话？他究竟会失去什么？一个丫头，一个像玩布娃娃似的玩弄最神圣的情感——玩弄爱情的丫头，会使她的父亲幸福吗？不会的！不会的！要是我在这条毒蛇咬伤自己父亲之前将它踩死，我还该得到感谢哩。





第五场


米勒走回来。斐迪南仍在房中。





米勒　饮料马上给您送到，男爵。可怜的丫头坐在外边哭得死去活来。她将在柠檬中掺进她的泪水送给您喝啊。

斐迪南　光是泪水还更好些！——我们刚才不是谈到音乐了吗，米勒？——（掏出一个钱包）我还欠你的债哩。

米勒　干什么？干什么？去您的吧，男爵！您把我当成什么人了？钱留在您手里挺好的，别让我难堪好不好！再说，上帝保佑，咱俩又不是从此不再见面。

斐迪南　谁知道呢？您只管收下吧。我说不定是死是活哟。

米勒　（笑起来）噢，原来这样，男爵！以您现在的处境，我想，是可能心一横倒下的。

斐迪南　有人确实横过心——您从未听说过年轻人倒下吗？青年男女，希望的孩子们，受骗父亲的空中楼阁，年岁的蛀虫都奈何不得的，却往往让一记雷击就打倒了！——您的露意丝也并非长生不死呵。

米勒　她是上帝赐予我的。

斐迪南　您听着——我告诉您，她并非长生不死。这个女儿是您的心肝宝贝儿。您全心全意眷恋她，疼爱她。可您当心，米勒。只有绝望的赌徒才会孤注一掷。哪个商人把全部财产都装在一艘船上，人家就叫他冒失鬼——听着，想一想我这警告。——可您为什么不收下这些钱呢？

米勒　怎么，先生？偌大的一袋钱？少爷您想到哪儿去啦？

斐迪南　还债呗——给！（将钱袋扔在桌上，从袋里滚出来几枚金币）我也不能永生永世守着这劳什子。

米勒　（惊愕）伟大的上帝，这是什么？听声音不像是银币！（走向桌子，发出惊呼）老天爷呀，您这是干啥，男爵？您以为您在什么地方，男爵？您搞的啥名堂，男爵？我只能说您在开玩笑！（将双手捧在一起）这儿确实是些个……要不就是我中了邪——要不……上帝诅咒我！我抓在手里的确实是上帝创造的金子啊，确实是硬邦邦、黄澄澄、圆溜溜的金圆！——不，魔鬼！我才不受你的诱惑呐！

斐迪南　您是酒喝多了怎么的，米勒？

米勒　（粗鲁地）见他妈的鬼！您快瞧瞧呀！——金子！

斐迪南　自然，事情是有点特别。

米勒　（沉默了一会儿又走向他，深有感触地）少爷，我告诉您我是一个老实正直的人，如果您想把我套起来，为您去干坏事的话——要知道，上帝明鉴，这么许多钱靠正当的营生是挣不来的。

斐迪南　（感动地）您放心吧，亲爱的米勒。您早就配得到这些钱了；上帝饶恕我，我是想用它们来报答您的一片好心啊。

米勒　（像疯了似的跳跳蹦蹦）这么说是我的啰！是我的啰！上帝明鉴，上帝恩典，是我的啰！（高叫着朝房门奔去）老婆！闺女！维克多莉亚！快来呀！（走回房中）可老天爷！我怎么会一下子得到这多得要命的财富？我凭什么挣来的？我该怎么回报？嗯？

斐迪南　不是靠您上的音乐课，米勒。——我给您这些钱，是要……（浑身打了个冷战）是要……（稍停，伤感地）偿付您女儿让我做了三个月的幸福美梦！

米勒　（抓住他的手紧紧握着）少爷啊！您要是个普通、平凡的市民——（加快语速）我闺女还不爱您，那我就要亲手宰了她，这丫头！（又走到钱袋旁，抑郁地）可现在我有了一切，您却一无所有。现在是不是又轮到我来花天酒地一番，嗯？

斐迪南　别担心，朋友！——我这就起程，去到那个我打算永远待下来的国度。在那儿，这些钱不再管用。

米勒　（眼睛死死盯着金币，兴奋地）这么说它们仍旧是我的？是我的？——不过您要走了我挺难过。——等着吧，看我现在会是个啥气派！看我现在会如何满面春风！（戴上帽子，大步流星地穿过房间）我要再到市场上去教音乐课，再抽三王牌的蹩脚烟，再坐三文钱的孬位子，就让魔鬼把我逮去好啦！（欲走）

斐迪南　等一等！别声张！把您的钱收起来吧！（郑重地）只是今晚上您还不能说出去。从今以后别再收学生啦，为了我的缘故。

米勒　（更加兴奋，紧紧抓住斐迪南的马夹，抑制不住内心的快乐）少爷啊！还有我女儿！（放开斐迪南）钱并非一切——不是的——我吃土豆也罢，吃野味也罢，饱总归是饱；我这件外套还蛮好嘛，只要上帝亲爱的阳光还没洞穿它的袖筒子！——破旧衣服我来穿好啦，可我闺女应该得到幸福。只要她的眼睛流露出什么心愿，她就应该得到满足……

斐迪南　（赶紧打断他）别讲了！呵，别……

米勒　（越发激动）我要让她从头开始学法语，学跳法国小步舞，学唱歌；让人家在报上读到关于她的报道；让她戴和枢密顾问千金的一样的漂亮帽子，穿各种各样我说不出名字的时髦衣裙；让远远近近的人们都谈论提琴师的女儿，让……

斐迪南　（激动得可怕地抓住米勒的手）别说啦！什么也别说啦，看在上帝分上，住口吧！只有今天，什么都别说；这就是我要求您给我的——唯一报答！





第六场


露意丝捧着柠檬汁上。前场人物。





露意丝　（眼睛哭得红红的，一边将杯子递给少校，一边声音颤抖地说）请只管吩咐，如果还不够浓的话！

斐迪南　（接过杯子去放在桌上，迅速将脸转向米勒）噢，我差点儿给忘了！——允许我求您办点儿事吗，亲爱的米勒！您乐意帮我个小忙吗？

米勒　万分乐意！您想要？……

斐迪南　人家等着我出席宴会。糟糕的是我心情坏透了。像这样子我完全不可能去见人。——您愿意去我父亲那儿代我表示一下歉意吗？

露意丝　（一惊，急忙抢过话头）我完全可以去走一趟。

米勒　去找宰相？

斐迪南　不见他本人。您只要在前厅里让一名侍从转达就行了。——带上我这只表作为证明。——等您回来时，我还在这儿。——您得等他回答。

露意丝　（惊恐地）干吗不可以我去呢？

斐迪南　（对正要动身的米勒）等一等，还有点儿事。这是一封给我父亲的信，今天傍晚封在给我的信里送来的——也许有什么要紧事——让侍从带给他吧。

米勒　没问题，男爵！

露意丝　（抱住父亲，惊恐到了极点）可是爸爸，所有这些我全能办好的呀！

米勒　你独自一人，天又这么黑，孩子。（下）

斐迪南　给你父亲照亮，露意丝。（在她端着灯送父亲出去时，奔到桌旁，把毒药倒进柠檬里）是啊，她该死！她该死！头顶的神明已对我首肯，道出了可怕的“是”字；复仇的天神也画了押；她的守护天使已将她抛弃……





第七场


斐迪南和露意丝。



露意丝端着灯慢慢走回来，把灯放在桌上，站在少校对面的另一侧，脸冲着地面，只是时不时地以怯生生的目光偷觑一下少校。他站在另一边，目光呆滞。长时间的沉默，预示紧张的一幕即将开始。





露意丝　您要乐意我伴奏，封·瓦尔特先生，我就弹一会儿钢琴。（打开琴盖）

斐迪南　（闷声不响，好一会儿不予回答）

露意丝　您还多赢我一盘棋哩。我们再下一次好吗，封·瓦尔特先生？

斐迪南　（又是一阵静默）

露意丝　唉，我好可怜啊！

斐迪南　（还是刚才的姿势）那是可能的。

露意丝　您心情这么糟，封·瓦尔特先生，不是我的错。

斐迪南　（脸朝一边冷笑两声）对我这样发痴发傻，你哪能有什么错？

露意丝　我明白了，我们现在不适合好下去。我承认，在您打发走我父亲的那一刻，我马上吃了一惊。——封·瓦尔特少爷，我猜想，这会儿我们两个人将同样难熬。你要是允许，我就去邀请我的几个熟人来吧。

斐迪南　噢，行啊，去吧。我也马上去邀几个我的熟人来。

露意丝　（愣愣地望着他）封·瓦尔特先生？

斐迪南　（非常辛辣地）以我的名誉起誓，在眼前的情况下没有谁能出更聪明的主意！这一来，令人厌烦的二重唱变成一阵子嘻嘻哈哈，失恋的苦恼也就从卖弄风情中得到了报偿。

露意丝　您情绪好些了吗，封·瓦尔特少爷？

斐迪南　再好不过！好得市场上的孩子们跟在我身后追，以为我是疯子！不，说真的，露意丝！你的榜样教训了我——你应该是我的老师。傻瓜才胡诌什么永远忠贞的爱情，老是一张面孔令人反感，变化无常才有滋有味儿——一言为定，露意丝！我奉陪到底——咱俩从一桩风流韵事跳到另一桩风流韵事，从一个泥潭滚向另一个泥潭——你朝东——我朝西。也许，在某一家妓院里会找回我失去了的宁静。——也许，在一阵快活的追逐之后，我和你成了两具腐朽的白骨，有朝一日又会不胜惊喜地相逢在一起，就像在喜剧里一样，彼此凭着同一母亲的任何一个孩子都不否认的血缘标志认出对方，致使厌恶与羞惭又变得和谐一致；这可是最最温柔的爱情也不可能的呀！

露意丝　呵，年轻人，年轻人！你已经是不幸的了，难道你还想让家人骂你咎由自取吗？

斐迪南　（咬牙切齿地喃喃道）我不幸？谁告诉你的？你这个女人太卑鄙了，自己已麻木不仁，又凭什么去衡量他人的感受呢？——不幸，她说？——哈！这个词儿简直可以从坟墓里唤醒我的愤懑！——她早已知道，我一定会不幸呐。——该死的东西！她明知如此，却仍然背叛了我，瞧这条毒蛇！原来还觉得有唯一一点可原谅的理由——你的自供将折断你的脖子——迄今为止我总以你的单纯来掩饰你的罪孽，不屑与你计较，让你差点儿逃脱我的报复。（急切地抓起杯子）原来你并不轻率——并不痴傻——你只是一个魔鬼而已！（喝柠檬汁）这柠檬汁淡而无味，就像你的灵魂——尝尝看！

露意丝　天啊！我害怕有这一幕，并非多虑？！

斐迪南　（以命令的口气）尝一尝！

露意丝　（勉强接过杯子，开始喝）

斐迪南　（一见她把杯子送到嘴边，立刻转过身，脸色刷地一下白了，同时跑到最里边的屋角去）

露意丝　这柠檬汁挺好嘛。

斐迪南　（未转过身来，浑身哆嗦）那你受用吧！

露意丝　（放下杯子）唉，您不知道，瓦尔特，您多么伤我的心。

斐迪南　哼！

露意丝　将来会有一个时间，瓦尔特……

斐迪南　（回到前面）噢，时间一到咱们就一了百了。

露意丝　到那时，今晚上的事会成为你良心的沉重负担——

斐迪南　（开始越走越急，越来越不安，同时扔掉挂在身上的绶带和佩剑）去你的吧，效忠殿下！

露意丝　我的上帝！您怎么啦？

斐迪南　又热又闹——希望舒服一点。

露意丝　喝柠檬汁吧！喝吧！喝了您会感觉凉快一点。

斐迪南　那倒一定会的。——瞧，婊子也有心眼儿好的时候！可仅此而已。

露意丝　（满含情意地扑进他怀里）你竟这么对你的露意丝吗，斐迪南？

斐迪南　（推开她）滚！滚！别让我再见到你这双温柔迷人的眼睛！我要死了，露出你狰狞的面目来吧，毒蛇；扑到我身上吧，害人精——尽管对我亮出你的毒牙，扭动身子高高直立起来，有多可憎就多可憎——只是别再装出天使的样子——别再装作天使！——太晚了——我必须踩死你，像踩死一条毒蛇，不然就会毫无希望。——怜悯一下你自己吧！

露意丝　呵！干吗非走这样的极端？

斐迪南　（从旁边端详着她）天上的雕塑家的美妙杰作！——谁能相信呢？——谁会相信呢？（抓住她的手，向上举起）造物主啊，我不想责难你——可你为什么偏偏将你的毒汁装进如此美好的躯壳？在那温暖的宜人的天国，罪恶能够繁衍滋生吗？——真叫奇怪哟！

露意丝　不得不听这样的话，而且保持沉默！

斐迪南　嗓音甜美悦耳——从断裂的琴弦上，怎么可能发出如此动人的乐音呢？（久久盯着她，目光已经陶醉）一切都这么美好——这么匀称——这么仙女似的圆满！——处处显示出造物主怡然自得的心境！上帝做证，仿佛大千世界之所以产生，仅仅是为了让造物主酝酿情绪，以便最后完成他这个杰作！——只可惜，上帝在塑造灵魂时失了手！怎么会呢？怎么可能让这么个令人憎恶的怪胎出生在人世上，而未受挑剔呢？（迅速离开她）或者他本来不想雕一个天使却雕成功了，因而赶忙给她凑上一副更坏的心肠，以为这样就能弥补错误了吧？

露意丝　好个花岗岩脑袋啊！他宁可指责上帝，也不肯承认自己冒失。

斐迪南　（痛哭着扑向露意丝，搂住她的脖子）最后一次，露意丝——最后一次，就像我俩初次接吻的那天，当时你嘴唇灼热，好不容易才轻轻唤出一声“斐迪南”，唤出第一声“亲爱的”！——呵，在那一瞬间，恰似不可言喻的无穷快乐的种子发芽了，开花了。——突然间，我们眼前出现一个天堂，美好得如同明媚的五月；黄金的世纪像一些新娘子，围绕着我们的灵魂欢呼雀跃！——那时候我真幸福啊！——呵，露意丝！露意丝！露意丝！你干吗要对我这样？

露意丝　您哭吧，您哭吧，瓦尔特！您理当对我表露您的悲哀，而没理由对我发泄您的怒气。

斐迪南　自欺欺人！这可不是悲哀的眼泪——不是那种温馨欢快地流入心灵创伤的甘露，不是那种能使滞塞的感情之轮重新转动的润滑油。只是零零落落的——冰冷冰冷的水滴——只是我爱情诀别时的战栗。（神情庄严得叫人害怕，同时把手抚在她头上）是为你的灵魂惋惜的眼泪，露意丝——是为上帝的一片好心惋惜的眼泪，他未能造出他杰作中的杰作——我觉得啊，整个宇宙都该戴上黑纱，都该为在它中间出了这样的事感到惊骇——人会堕落，乐园会失去，这是常情；可是，如果天使中间也流行起瘟疫来，那就只能让哀号声响彻整个大自然了！

露意丝　别逼我走上绝路，瓦尔特。我的灵魂足够坚强——可它必须承受一次人为的考验。瓦尔特，再说一句话，然后咱们分手。——可怕的命运扰乱了我们心灵的语言。要是我能够开口，瓦尔特，我会告诉你一些事情——我会的……可是呢，严酷的命运束缚住了我的舌头，还有我的爱情；即使你现在待我像个下贱的婊子，我也只好忍受。

斐迪南　你还舒服吗，露意丝？

露意丝　干吗问这个？

斐迪南　不这样我就替你感到遗憾，因为你将不得不带着这个谎言离开人世。

露意丝　我求您啦，瓦尔特……

斐迪南　（万分激动地）不！不！这样报复太凶狠！不，上帝保佑我！我不愿将她赶到另一个世界去——露意丝！你爱过侍卫长吗？你再不会走出这间房间了。

露意丝　您想问什么就问吧。我可什么也不再回答。（坐下）

斐迪南　（激动万分地跪在她脚下）露意丝，你爱过侍卫长吗？不等这一支蜡烛燃完——你就将站在——上帝面前！

露意丝　（惊骇得跳起来）耶稣啊！这是怎么的？……我难受得要命。（倒在椅子上）

斐迪南　已经感到难受？你们女人真是些猜不透的谜啊！你们娇弱的神经足以咬碎人类之根的罪恶；可是呢，一丁点儿砒霜就够把你们毒倒。

露意丝　毒药？毒药！我的上帝！

斐迪南　恐怕是喽。你的柠檬汁是地狱调制的。你用它冲死神干了杯。

露意丝　死！死！仁慈的主啊！柠檬汁有毒，喝了就会死！——怜悯我的灵魂吧，仁慈的上帝！

斐迪南　要紧就要紧在这儿。我也会同样地祈求他。

露意丝　可我的母亲……我的父亲……救世主啊！我可怜的绝望的父亲！难道已没救了吗？我年纪轻轻，已没救了！我现在一定要完了吗？

斐迪南　没救了，一定完了。——可是别紧张：咱俩一块儿走。

露意丝　斐迪南，你也一样！毒药，斐迪南！是你放的？上帝啊，原谅他吧！——仁慈的主啊，免除他的罪孽吧！

斐迪南　去了结你自己的账吧——我担心，情况不妙哩！

露意丝　斐迪南！斐迪南！——呵，我现在不能再沉默下去！——死亡——死亡消除了一切誓约——斐迪南，天地间没有比你更不幸的人啦！——我死得冤枉哟，斐迪南！

斐迪南　（骇异）她在说什么？——死到临头，人通常都不再撒谎的呀！

露意丝　我没撒谎——没撒谎——我一辈子仅仅就一次——唉！我怎么浑身发冷，哆嗦！——就撒过一次谎，就是在我写那封给侍卫长的信的时候。

斐迪南　哈！那封信！——赞美上帝！现在我又完全恢复了我的男子气概。

露意丝　（舌头渐渐不听使唤，手指开始痉挛）这封信——请您沉住气，准备听一句可怕的自白——是我违心地写的，句句遵照令尊大人的指示。

斐迪南　（呆若木鸡，久久地毫无生气，最后像遭了雷击似的突然倒下）

露意丝　可怕的误解呵——斐迪南——他们逼迫我——请原谅——你的露意丝宁肯死去啊！——可是我父亲——处于危险之中——他们搞的阴谋诡计。

斐迪南　（愤怒跳起）感谢上帝，我还没感到毒性发作。（拔出佩剑）

露意丝　（越来越虚弱）可悲啊！你打算干什么？他是你的父亲——

斐迪南　（怒不可遏地）凶手加上凶手的父亲！——他必须一块儿死，这样，人间的审判者才可能将怒火发泄在真正的罪人身上！（欲走出房间）

露意丝　救世主临终时会宽恕一切人——愿你和他也得到宽恕。（死去）

斐迪南　（很快转过身，正好看见她咽最后一口气，悲痛欲绝地倒在死者面前）等一等！等一等！别扔下我啊，我的天使！（抓起她的手来很快又放下）已经凉了啊，又凉又湿！她的灵魂已经离开！（又跳起来）我的露意丝的主啊！慈悲！对凶手中最卑劣的凶手发慈悲！这是她最后的祈愿呐！——连死后的她也多么美丽，多么动人！死神也受了感动，在掠过这和善的脸颊时倍加小心。——这温柔的容颜才不是毫无生气的面具哩，它抗拒住了死的侵袭。（过了一会儿）可怎么搞的？我为什么一点感觉没有？难道我青春的活力会拯救我吗？枉费心机啊！我自己不愿意！（说着抓起杯子）





最后一场


斐迪南、宰相、伍尔穆和众侍从。



宰相和他的一帮人惊惶失措地冲进房间，随后米勒和一些群众也跟进来。法庭的差役们集中站在房间最里边。





宰相　（手握着信）儿子，这是怎么啦？——我可永远不愿相信——

斐迪南　（把杯子扔在他脚下）那你就瞧吧，凶手！

宰相　（踉跄倒退。所有人都惊呆了。可怕的寂静）我的儿子啊！为什么你对我这么干？

斐迪南　（不正眼瞧他）噢，当然！我本该先听一听大政治家的意见，看这么做是否也符合他的安排？——真巧妙，真令人佩服，你们这个用嫉妒来拆散我俩同心结的阴谋，我承认！——出谋划策的肯定是位行家；遗憾的只是，被激怒的爱情不像你手中的玩偶，不会乖乖儿地听任摆布！

宰相　（目光四处搜寻）这里没有任何人为一位绝望的父亲哭泣吗？

米勒　（在后台呼喊）让我进去！看在上帝分上，让我进去！

斐迪南　这姑娘是位圣女——她该有另外的人照顾。（为米勒打开门。米勒、群众和法庭的差役一拥而入）

米勒　（惊恐万状）我的孩子！我的孩子！——（有人喊叫：“这儿服毒啦！这儿有人服毒啦！”）——我的女儿哟，你在哪里啊？

斐迪南　（把他领到宰相和露意丝的尸体之间）不是我的错。该感谢这儿这位！

米勒　（倒在女儿身边）救世主耶稣啊！

斐迪南　简单说几句，爸爸——言语对我来说已变得宝贵了……我好端端地被夺去了生命，被爸爸您！我怎样面对上帝呵，我直打哆嗦……可我从来不是坏蛋。我将遭到怎样的永劫，只好听天由命了——但愿不惩罚您！——然而我杀了人。（声音尖锐得可怕）这桩杀人罪，您该不会妄想我一个人背着去见上帝吧！这儿，我郑重地把更大、更丑恶的一半奉还给你，至于拿它怎么办，就是你自己的事了。（把父亲拽到尸体跟前）这儿，野蛮人，品尝品尝你狡诈的可怕果实吧：在这张脸上，歪歪扭扭地写着你的名字，行刑的天使将会认出来的呀！——这个形象，将在您入睡时扯下你床前的帷幔，把她冰冷的手伸向你！这个形象，将在你临终时站到你的灵魂前，挤掉你最后的祈祷！这个形象，将伫立在你的坟墓上，当你希望复活的时候——将站在上帝的旁边，当他审判你的时候！（即将昏厥，被侍从们扶住）

宰相　（手臂举向天空，恐怖地）别怪我！别怪我，上帝！——向这人索取他们的灵魂吧！（走向伍尔穆）

伍尔穆　（气愤地）向我？

宰相　该死的，向你！向你，魔鬼！——是你，是你定下的毒计。责任在你身上——我两手清白！

伍尔穆　在我身上？（一阵怪笑）有意思！有意思！这下我可知道魔鬼是怎么报恩的喽。——在我身上？愚蠢的流氓！难道他是我儿子，我是你主子不成？——责任在我身上？哈！一见这情形我骨髓全凉了！要我来负责任！——现在我算完了，可你也得一块儿完。走！走！咱们去大街小巷喊“杀人啦！杀人啦”！去把法官们都叫醒！法警，把我捆起来吧！从这里带走吧！我要揭露一些阴谋，叫听见的人浑身打冷战。（欲下）

宰相　（拦住他）他真的会吗，疯子？

伍尔穆　（拍拍宰相的肩）我会的，伙计！我会——我是疯了，真的——多亏了你嘛——现在我真要发发疯——我要和你手挽手地上断头台！——手挽手地下地狱！我真巴不得和你一道受诅咒啊，恶棍！（被带出房间）

米勒　（一直默默地把头埋在露意丝怀里，痛不欲生。这时突然站起来，将钱包掷到少校脚下）投毒犯，收回你造孽的金子吧！——你想拿它买下我的女儿是不是？（冲出房去）

斐迪南　（嗓音嘶哑）追上他！他绝望了——这钱得替他收起来——它是我可怕的报答。露意丝——露意丝——我来了——多保重！——让我在这座祭坛前离开人世吧——

宰相　（大梦初醒似的走向儿子）斐迪南——儿子！难道你不屑于再看一眼你悲惨的父亲吗？

斐迪南　（被放在露意丝身边）最后一瞥属于仁慈的上帝。

宰相　（痛苦不堪地跪在斐迪南跟前）造物和造物主全抛弃了我——再看我一眼，给我最后一点安慰，都不行吗？

斐迪南　（把手无力地伸给他）

宰相　（迅速站起身）他饶恕我了！（对其他人）现在把我抓起来吧！（下，法警们跟在他后面。幕落）

ACT I.





SCENE I.


MILLER-MRS. MILLER.





MILLER (walking quickly up and down the room). Once for all! The affair is becoming serious. My daughter and the baron will soon be the town-talk-my house lose its character-the president will get wind of it, and-the short and long of the matter is, I'll show the younker the door.

MRS MILLER. You did not entice him to your house-did not thrust your daughter upon him!

MILLER. Didn't entice him to my house-didn't thrust the girl upon him! Who'll believe me? I was master of my own house. I ought to have taken more care of my daughter. I should have bundled the major out at once, or have gone straight to his excellency, his papa, and disclosed all. The young baron will get off merely with a snubbing, I know that well enough, and all the blame will fall upon the fiddler.

MRS MILLER (sipping her coffee). Pooh! Nonsense! How can it fall upon you? What have people to do with you? You follow your profession, and pick up pupils wherever you can find them.

MILLER. All very fine, but please to tell me what will be the upshot of the whole affair? He can't marry the girl-marriage is out of the question, and to make her his-God help us! "Good-by t'ye!" No, no-when such a sprig of nobility has been nibbling here and there and everywhere, and has glutted himself with the devil knows what all, of course it will be a relish to my young gentleman to get a mouthful of sweet water. Take heed! Take heed! If you were dotted with eyes, and could place a sentinel for every hair of your head, he'll bamboozle her under your very nose; add one to her reckoning, take himself off, and the girl's ruined for life, left in the lurch, or, having once tasted the trade, will carry it on. (Striking his forehead.) Oh, horrible thought!

MRS MILLER. God in his mercy protect us!

MILLER. We shall want his protection. You may well say that. What other object can such a scapegrace have? The girl is handsome-well made-can show a pretty foot. How the upper story is furnished matters little. That's blinked in you women if nature has not played the niggard in other respects. Let this harum-scarum but turn over this chapter-Ho! Ho! His eyes will glisten like Rodney's when he got scent of a French frigate; then up with all sail and at her, and I don't blame him for it-flesh is flesh. I know that very well.

MRS MILLER. You should only read the beautiful billy-doux which the baron writes to your daughter. Gracious me! Why it's as clear as the sun at noonday that he loves her purely for her virtuous soul.

MILLER. That's the right strain! We beat the sack, but mean the ass's back. He who wishes to pay his respects to the flesh needs only a kind heart for a go-between. What did I myself? When we've once so far cleared the ground that the affections cry ready! Slap! The bodies follow their example, the appetites are obedient, and the silver moon kindly plays the pimp.

MRS MILLER. And then only think of the beautiful books that the major has sent us. Your daughter always prays out of them.

MILLER (whistles). Prays! You've hit the mark. The plain, simple food of nature is much too raw and indigestible for this maccaroni gentleman's stomach. It must be cooked for him artificially in the infernal pestilential pitcher of your novel-writers. Into the fire with the rubbish! I shall have the girl taking up with-God knows what all-about heavenly fooleries that will get into her blood, like Spanish flies, and scatter to the winds the handful of Christianity that cost her father so much trouble to keep together. Into the fire with them I say! The girl will take the devil's own nonsense into her head; amidst the dreams of her fool's paradise she'll not know her own home, but forget and feel ashamed of her father, the music-master; and, lastly, I shall lose a worthy, honest son-in-law who might have nestled himself so snugly into my connections.No! Damn it! (Jumps up in a passion.) I'll break the neck of it at once, and the major-yes, yes, the major! Shall be shown where the carpenter made the door. (Going.)

MRS MILLER. Be civil, Miller! How many a bright shilling have his presents——

MILLER (comes back, and goes up to her). The blood money of my daughter? To Beelzebub with thee, thou infamous bawd! Sooner will I vagabondize with my violin and fiddle for a bit of bread-sooner will I break to pieces my instrument and carry dung on the sounding-board than taste a mouthful earned by my only child at the price of her soul and future happiness. Give up your cursed coffee and snuff-taking, and there will be no need to carry your daughter's face to market. I have always had my bellyful and a good shirt to my back before this confounded scamp put his nose into my crib.

MRS MILLER. Now don't be so ready to pitch the house out of window. How you flare up all of a sudden. I only meant to say that we shouldn't offend the major, because he is the son of the president.

MILLER. There lies the root of the mischief. For that reason-for that very reason the thing must be put a stop to this very day!The president, if he is a just and upright father, will give me his thanks. You must brush up my red plush, and I will go straight to his excellency. I shall say to him-"Your excellency's son has an eye to my daughter; my daughter is not good enough to be your excellency's son's wife, but too good to be your excellency's son's strumpet, and there's an end of the matter. My name is Miller."





SCENE II.


Enter SECRETARY WORM.





MRS MILLER. Ah! Good morning, Mr. Seckertary! Have we indeed the pleasure of seeing you again?

WORM. All on my side-on my side, cousin Miller! Where a high-born cavalier's visits are received mine can be of no account whatever.

MRS MILLER. How can you think so, Mr. Seckertary? His lordship the baron, Major Ferdinand, certainly does us the honor to look in now and then; but, for all that, we don't undervalue others.

MILLER (vexed). A chair, wife, for the gentleman! Be seated, kinsman.

WORM (lays aside hat and stick, and seats himself). Well, well-and how then is my future-or past-bride? I hope she'll not be-may I not have the honor of seeing-Miss Louisa?

MRS MILLER. Thanks for inquiries, Mr. Seckertary, but my daughter is not at all proud.

MILLER (angry, jogs her with his elbow). Woman!

MRS MILLER. Sorry she can't have that honor, Mr. Seckertary. My daughter is now at mass.

WORM. I am glad to hear it-glad to hear it. I shall have in her a pious, Christian wife!

MRS MILLER (smiling in a stupidly affected manner). Yes-but, Mr.Seckertary——

MILLER (greatly incensed, pulls her ears). Woman!

MRS MILLER. If our family can serve you in any other way-with the greatest pleasure, Mr. Seckertary——

WORM (frowning angrily). In any other way? Much obliged! Much obliged!-Hm! Hm! Hm!

MRS MILLER. But, as you yourself must see, Mr. Seckertary——

MILLER (in a rage, shaking his fist at her). Woman!

MRS MILLER. Good is good, and better is better, and one does not like to stand between fortune and one's only child (with vulgar pride). You understand me, Mr. Seckertary?

WORM. Understand. Not exac-. Oh, yes. But what do you really mean?

MRS MILLER. Why-why-I only think-I mean-(coughs).Since then Providence has determined to make a great lady of my daughter——

WORM (jumping from his chair). What's that you say? what?

MILLER. Keep your seat, keep your seat, Mr. Secretary! The woman's an out-and-out fool! Where's the great lady to come from? How you show your donkey's ears by talking such stuff.

MRS MILLER. Scold as long as you will. I know what I know, and what the major said he said.

MILLER (snatches up his fiddle in anger). Will you hold your tongue?Shall I throw my fiddle at your head? What can you know? What can he have said? Take no notice of her clack, kinsman! Away with you to your kitchen! You'll not think me first cousin of a fool, and that I'm looking out so high for the girl? You'll not think that of me, Mr. Secretary?

WORM. Nor have I deserved it of you, Mr. Miller! You have always shown yourself a man of your word, and my contract to your daughter was as good as signed. I hold an office that will maintain a thrifty manager; the president befriends me; the door to advancement is open to me whenever I may choose to take advantage of it. You see that my intentions towards Miss Louisa are serious; if you have been won over by a fop of rank——

MRS MILLER. Mr. Seckertary! More respect, I beg——

MILLER. Hold your tongue, I say. Never mind her, kinsman. Things remain as they were. The answer I gave you last harvest, I repeat today. I'll not force my daughter. If you suit her, well and good;then it's for her to see that she can be happy with you. If she shakes her head-still better-be it so, I should say-then you must be content to pocket the refusal, and part in good fellowship over a bottle with her father. 'Tis the girl who is to live with you-not I.Why should I, out of sheer caprice, fasten a husband upon the girl for whom she has no inclination? That the evil one may haunt me down like a wild beast in my old age-that in every drop I drink-in every bit of bread I bite, I might swallow the bitter reproach:Thou art the villain who destroyed his child's happiness!

MRS MILLER. The short and the long of it is-I refuse my consent downright; my daughter's intended for a lofty station, and I'll go to law if my husband is going to be talked over.

MILLER. Shall I break every bone in your body, you millclack?

WORM (to MILLER). Paternal advice goes a great way with the daughter, and I hope you know me, Mr. Miller?

MILLER. Plague take you! 'Tis the girl must know you. What an old crabstick like me can see in you is just the very last thing that a dainty young girl wants. I'll tell you to a hair if you're the man for an orchestra-but a woman's heart is far too deep for a music-master. And then, to be frank with you-you know that I'm a blunt, straightforward fellow-you'll not give thank'ye for my advice. I'll persuade my daughter to no one-but from you Mr. Sec-I would dissuade her! A lover who calls upon the father for help-with permission-is not worth a pinch of snuff. If he has anything in him, he'll be ashamed to take that old-fashioned way of making his deserts known to his sweetheart. If he hasn't the courage, why he's a milksop, and no Louisas were born for the like of him. No! He must carry on his commerce with the daughter behind the father's back. He must manage so to win her heart, that she would rather wish both father and mother at Old Harry than give him up-or that she come herself, fall at her father's feet, and implore either for death on the rack, or the only one of her heart. That's the fellow for me! That I call love! And he who can't bring matters to that pitch with a petticoat may-stick the goose feather in his cap.

WORM (seizes hat and stick and hurries out of the room). Much obliged, Mr. Miller!

MILLER (going after him slowly). For what? For what? You haven't taken anything, Mr. Secretary! (Comes back.) He won't hear, and off he's gone. The very sight of that quill-driver is like poison and brimstone to me. An ugly, contraband knave, smuggled into the world by some lewd prank of the devil-with his malicious little pig's eyes, foxy hair, and nut-cracker chin, just as if Nature, enraged at such a bungled piece of goods, had seized the ugly monster by it, and flung him aside. No! Rather than throw away my daughter on a vagabond like him, she may-God forgive me!

MRS MILLER. The wretch!-But you'll be made to keep a clean tongue in your head!

MILLER. Ay, and you too, with your pestilential baron-you, too, must put my bristles up. You're never more stupid than when you have the most occasion to show a little sense. What's the meaning of all that trash about your daughter being a great lady? If it's to be cried out about the town tomorrow, you need only let that fellow get scent of it. He is one of your worthies who go sniffing about into people's houses, dispute upon everything, and, if a slip of the tongue happen to you, skurry with it straight to the prince, mistress, and minister, and then there's the devil to pay.





SCENE III.


Enter LOUISA with a book in her hand.





LOUISA. Good morning, dear father!

MILLER (affectionately). Bless thee, my Louisa! I rejoice to see thy thoughts are turned so diligently to thy Creator. Continue so, and his arm will support thee.

LOUISA. Oh! I am a great sinner, father! Was he not here, mother?

MRS MILLER. Who, my child?

LOUISA. Ah! I forgot that there are others in the world besides him-my head wanders so. Was he not here? Ferdinand?

MILLER (with melancholy, serious voice). I thought my Louisa had forgotten that name in her devotions?

LOUISA (after looking at him steadfastly for some time). I understand you, father. I feel the knife which stabs my conscience; but it comes too late. I can no longer pray, father. Heaven and Ferdinand divide my bleeding soul, and I fear-I fear-(after a pause). Yet no, no, good father. The painter is best praised when we forget him in the contemplation of his picture. When in the contemplation of his masterpiece, my delight makes me forget the Creator-is not that, father, the true praise of God?

MILLER (throws himself in displeasure on a chair). There we have it!Those are the fruits of your ungodly reading.

LOUISA (uneasy, goes to the window). Where can he be now? Ah!The high-born ladies who see him-listen to him——I am a poor forgotten maiden. (Startles at that word, and rushes to her father.)But no, no! Forgive me. I do not repine at my lot. I ask but little-to think on him-that can harm no one. Ah! That I might breathe out this little spark of life in one soft fondling zephyr to cool his check! That this fragile floweret, youth, were a violet, on which he might tread, and I die modestly beneath his feet! I ask no more, father! Can the proud, majestic day-star punish the gnat for basking in its rays?

MILLER (deeply affected, leans on the arm of his chair, and covers his face). My child, my child, with joy would I sacrifice the remnant of my days hadst thou never seen the major.

LOUISA (terrified.) How; how? What did you say? No, no! That could not be your meaning, good father. You know not that Ferdinand is mine! You know not that God created him for me, and for my delight alone! (After a pause of recollection.) The first moment that I beheld him-and the blood rushed into my glowing cheeks-every pulse beat with joy; every throb told me, every breath whispered,"'Tis he!” And my heart, recognizing the long-desired one, repeated “'Tis he!” And the whole world was as one melodious echo of my delight! Then-oh! Then was the first dawning of my soul! A thousand new sentiments arose in my bosom, as flowers arise from the earth when spring approaches. I forgot there was a world, yet never had I felt that world so dear to me! I forgot there was a God, yet never had I so loved him!

MILLER (runs to her and clasps her to his bosom). Louisa! My beloved, my admirable child! Do what thou wilt. Take all-all-my life-the baron- God is my witness-him I can never give thee! [Exit.

LOUISA. Nor would I have him now, father! Time on earth is but a stinted dewdrop in the ocean of eternity. ‘Twill swiftly glide in one delicious dream of Ferdinand. I renounce him for this life! But then, mother-then when the bounds of separation are removed-when the hated distinctions of rank no longer part us-when men will be only men-I shall bring nothing with me save my innocence! Yet often has my father told me that at the Almighty's coming riches and titles will be worthless; and that hearts alone will be beyond all price. Oh! Then shall I be rich! There, tears will be reckoned for triumphs, and purity of soul be preferred to an illustrious ancestry. Then, then, mother, shall I be noble! In what will he then be superior to the girl of his heart?

MRS. MILLER (starts from her seat). Louisa! The baron! He is jumping over the fence! Where shall I hide myself?

LOUISA (begins to tremble). Oh! Do not leave me, mother!

MRS MILLER. Mercy! What a figure I am. I am quite ashamed! I cannot let his lordship see me in this state!

[Exit.





SCENE IV.


LOUISA-FERDINAND. (He flies towards her-she falls back into her chair, pale and trembling. He remains standing before her-they look at each other for some moments in silence. A pause.)





FERDINAND. So pale, Louisa?

LOUISA (rising, and embracing him). It is nothing-nothing now that you are here-it is over.

FERDINAND (takes her hand and raises it to his lips). And does my Louisa still love me? My heart is yesterday's; is thine the same? I flew hither to see if thou wert happy, that I might return and be so too. But I find thee whelmed in sorrow!

LOUISA. Not so, my beloved, not so!

FERDINAND. Confess, Louisa! You are not happy. I see through your soul as clearly as through the transparent lustre of this brilliant. No spot can harbor here unmarked by me-no thought can cloud your brow that does not reach your lover's heart. Whence comes this grief? Tell me, I beseech you! Ah! Could I feel assured this mirror still remained unsullied, there'd seem to me no cloud in all the universe! Tell me, dear Louisa, what afflicts you?

LOUISA (looking at him with anxiety for a few moments). Ferdinand!Couldst thou but know how such discourse exalts the tradesman's daughter——

FERDINAND (surprised). What say'st thou? Tell me, girl! How camest thou by that thought? Thou art my Louisa! Who told thee thou couldst be aught else? See, false one, see, for what coldness I must chide thee! Were indeed thy whole soul absorbed by love for me, never hadst thou found time to draw comparisons! When I am with thee, my prudence is lost in one look from thine eyes: when I am absent in a dream of thee! But thou -thou canst harbor prudence in the sane breast with love! Fie on thee! Every moment bestowed on this sorrow was a robbery from affection and from me!

LOUISA (pressing his hand and shaking her head with a melancholy air). Ferdinand, you would lull my apprehensions to sleep; you would divert my eyes from the precipice into which I am falling.I can see the future! The voice of honor-your prospects, your father's anger-my nothingness. (Shuddering and suddenly drops his hands.) Ferdinand! A sword hangs over us! They would separate us!

FERDINAND (jumps up). Separate us! Whence these apprehensions, Louisa? Who can rend the bonds that bind two hearts, or separate the tones of one accord? True, I am a nobleman-but show me that my patent of nobility is older than the eternal laws of the universe-or my escutcheon more valid than the handwriting of heaven in my Louisa's eyes? “This woman is for this man?” I am son of the prime minister. For that very reason, what but love can soften the curses which my father's extortions from the country will entail upon me?

LOUISA. Oh! How I fear that father!

FERDINAND. I fear nothing-nothing but that your affection should know bounds. Let obstacles rise between us, huge as mountains, I will look upon them as a ladder by which to fly into the arms of my Louisa! The tempest of opposing fate shall but fan the flame of my affection dangers will only serve to make Louisa yet more charming. Then speak no more of terrors, my love! I myself-I will watch over thee carefully as the enchanter's dragon watches over buried gold. Trust thyself to me! Thou shalt need no other angel.I will throw myself between thee and fate- for thee receive each wound. For thee will I catch each drop distilled from the cup of joy, and bring thee in the bowl of love. (Embracing affectionately.) This arm shall support my Louisa through life. Fairer than it dismissed thee, shall heaven receive thee back, and confess with delight that love alone can give perfection to the soul.

LOUISA (disengaging herself from him, greatly agitated). No more! I beseech thee, Ferdinand! No more! Couldst thou know. Oh! Leave me, leave me! Little dost thou feel how these hopes rend my heart in pieces like fiends! (Going.)

FERDINAND (detaining her). Stay, Louisa! Stay! Why this agitation?Why those anxious looks?

LOUISA. I had forgotten these dreams, and was happy. Now-now-from this day is the tranquillity of my heart no more. Wild impetuous wishes will torment my bosom! Go! God forgive thee!Thou hast hurled a firebrand into my young peaceful heart which nothing can extinguish! (She breaks from him, and rushes from the apartment, followed by FERDINAND.)





SCENE V.


A Chamber in the PRESIDENT.'s House.



The PRESIDENT, with the grand order of the cross about his neck, and a star at his breast-SECRETARY WORM.





PRESIDENT. A serious attachment, say you? No, no, Worm; that I never can believe.

WORM. If your excellency pleases, I will bring proofs of my assertions.

PRESIDENT. That he has a fancy for the wench-flatters her-and, if you will, pretends to love her-all this is very possible-nay-excusable -but-and the daughter of a musician, you say?

WORM. Of Miller, the music-master.

PRESIDENT. Handsome? But that, of course.

WORM (with warmth). A most captivating and lovely blondine, who, without saying too much, might figure advantageously beside the greatest beauties of the court.

PRESIDENT (laughs). It's very plain, Worm, that you have an eye upon the jade yourself-I see that. But listen, Worm. That my son has a passion for the fair sex gives me hope that he will find favor with the ladies. He may make his way at court. The girl is handsome, you say; I am glad to think my son has taste. Can he deceive the silly wench by holding out honorable intentions-still better; it will show that he is shrewd enough to play the hypocrite when it serves his purpose. He may become prime minister-if he accomplishes his purpose! Admirable! That will prove to me that fortune favors him. Should the farce end with a chubby grandchild-incomparable! I will drink an extra bottle of Malaga to the prospects of my pedigree, and cheerfully pay the wench's lying-in expenses.

WORM. All I wish is that your excellency may not have to drink that bottle to drown your sorrow.

PRESIDENT (sternly). Worm! Remember that what I once believe, I believe obstinately-that I am furious when angered. I am willing to pass over as a joke this attempt to stir my blood. That you are desirous of getting rid of your rival, I can very well comprehend, and that, because you might have some difficulty in supplanting the son, you endeavor to make a cat's paw of the father, I can also understand-I am even delighted to find that you are master of such excellent qualifications in the way of roguery. Only, friend Worm, pray don't make me, too, the butt of your knavery.Understand me, have a care that your cunning trench not upon my plans!

WORM. Pardon me, your excellency! If even-as you suspect-jealousy is concerned, it is only with the eye, and not with the tongue.

PRESIDENT. It would be better to dispense with it altogether. What can it matter to you, simpleton, whether you get your coin fresh from the mint, or it comes through a banker? Console yourself with the example of our nobility. Whether known to the bridegroom or not, I can assure you that, amongst us of rank, scarcely a marriage takes place but what at least half a dozen of the guests-or the footmen-can state the geometrical area of the bridegroom's paradise.

WORM (bowing). My lord! Upon this head I confess myself a plebeian.

PRESIDENT. And, besides, you may soon have the satisfaction of turning the laugh most handsomely against your rival. At this very moment it is under consideration in the cabinet, that, upon the arrival of the new duchess, Lady Milford shall apparently be discarded, and, to complete the deception, form an alliance. You know, Worm, how greatly my influence depends upon this lady-how my mightiest prospects hang upon the passions of the prince.The duke is now seeking a partner for Lady Milford. Some one else may step in-conclude the bargain for her ladyship, win the confidence of the prince, and make himself indispensable, to my cost. Now, to retain the prince in the meshes of my family, I have resolved that my Ferdinand shall marry Lady Milford. Is that clear to you?

WORM. Quite dazzling! Your excellency has at least convinced me that, compared with the president, the father is but a novice. Should the major prove as obedient a son as you show yourself a tender father, your demand may chance to be returned with a protest.

PRESIDENT. Fortunately I have never yet had to fear opposition to my will when once I have pronounced, “It shall be so!” But now, Worm, that brings us back to our former subject! I will propose Lady Milford to my son this very day. The face which he puts upon it shall either confirm your suspicions or entirely confute them.

WORM. Pardon me, my lord! The sullen face which he most assuredly will put upon it may be placed equally to the account of the bride you offer to him as of her from whom you wish to separate him. I would beg of you a more positive test! Propose to him some perfectly unexceptionable woman. Then, if he consents, let Secretary Worm break stones on the highway for the next three years.

PRESIDENT (biting his lips). The devil!

WORM. Such is the case, you may rest assured! The mother-stupidity itself-has, in her simplicity, betrayed all to me.

PRESIDENT (pacing the room, and trying to repress his rage). Good!This very morning, then!

WORM. Yet, let me entreat your excellency not to forget that the major— is my master's son——

PRESIDENT. No harm shall come to him, Worm.

WORM. And that my service in ridding you of an unwelcome daughter-in-law——

PRESIDENT. Should be rewarded by me helping you to a wife? That too, Worm!

WORM (bowing with delight). Eternally your lordship's slave. (Going.)

PRESIDENT (threatening him). As to what I have confided to you, Worm! If you dare but to whisper a syllable——

WORM (laughs). Then your excellency will no doubt expose my forgeries!

[Exit.



PRESIDENT. Yes, yes, you are safe enough! I hold you in the fetters of your own knavery, like a trout on the hook!

Enter SERVANT.



SERVANT. Marshal Kalb——

PRESIDENT. The very man I wished to see. Introduce him.

[Exit SERVANT.





SCENE VI.


MARSHAL KALB, in a rich but tasteless court-dress, with Chamberlain's keys, two watches, sword, three-cornered hat, and hair dressed a la Herisson. He bustles up to the PRESIDENT, and diffuses a strong scent of musk through the whole theatre-PRESIDENT.





MARSHAL. Ah! Good morning, my dear baron! Quite delighted to see you again-pray forgive my not having paid my respects to you at an earlier hour-the most pressing business-the duke's bill of fare-invitation cards-arrangements for the sledge party today-ah!-besides it was necessary for me to be at the levee, to inform his highness of the state of the weather.

PRESIDENT. True, marshal! Such weighty concerns were not to be neglected!

MARSHAL. Then a rascally tailor, too, kept me waiting for him!PRESIDENT. And yet ready to the moment?

MARSHAL. Nor is that all! One misfortune follows at the heels of the other today! Only hear me!

PRESIDENT (absent). Can it be possible?

MARSHAL. Just listen! Scarce had I quitted my carriage, when the horses became restive, and began to plunge and rear-only imagine!-splashed my breeches all over with mud! What was to be done? Fancy, my dear baron, just fancy yourself for a moment in my predicament! There I stood! The hour was late! A day's journey to return-yet to appear before his highness in this-good heavens! What did I bethink me of? I pretended to faint! They bundle me into my carriage! I drive home like mad- change my dress-hasten back-and only think!-In spite of all this I was the first person in the antechamber! What say you to that?

PRESIDENT. A most admirable impromptu of mortal wit-but tell me, Kalb, did you speak to the duke?

MARSHAL (importantly). Full twenty minutes and a half.

PRESIDENT. Indeed? Then doubtless you have important news to impart to me?

MARSHAL (seriously, after a pause of reflection). His highness wears a Merde d'Oye beaver today.

PRESIDENT. God bless me!-and yet, marshal, I have even greater news to tell you. Lady Milford will soon become my daughter-in-law. That, I think will be new to you?

MARSHAL. Is it possible! And is it already agreed upon?

PRESIDENT. It is settled, marshal-and you would oblige me by forthwith waiting upon her ladyship, and preparing her to receive Ferdinand's visit. You have full liberty, also, to circulate the news of my son's approaching nuptials.

MARSHAL. My dear friend! With consummate pleasure! What can I desire more? I fly to the baroness this moment. Adieu! (Embracing him.) In less than three-quarters of an hour it shall be known throughout the town. [Skips off.

PRESIDENT (smiling contemptuously). How can people say that such creatures are of no use in the world? Now, then, Master Ferdinand must either consent or give the whole town the lie. (Rings-WORM enters.) Send my son hither. (WORM retires; the PRESIDENT walks up and down, full of thought.)





SCENE VII.


PRESIDENT-FERDINAND.





FERDINAND. In obedience to your commands, sir——

PRESIDENT. Ay, if I desire the presence of my son, I must command it- Ferdinand, I have observed you for some time past, and find no longer that open vivacity of youth which once so delighted me. An unusual sorrow broods upon your features; you shun your father; you shun society. For shame, Ferdinand! At your age a thousand irregularities are easier forgiven than one instant of idle melancholy. Leave this to me, my son! Leave the care of your future happiness to my direction, and study only to co-operate with my designs-come, Ferdinand, embrace me!

FERDINAND. You are most gracious today, father!

PRESIDENT. “Today,” you rogue? And your “today” with such a vinegar look? (Seriously.) Ferdinand! For whose sake have I trod that dangerous path which leads to the affections of the prince? For whose sake have I forever destroyed my peace with Heaven and my conscience? Hear me, Ferdinand-I am speaking to my son.For whom have I paved the way by the removal of my predecessor?A deed which the more deeply gores my inward feelings the more carefully I conceal the dagger from the world! Tell me, Ferdinand, for whose sake have I done all this?

FERDINAND (recoiling with horror). Surely not for mine, father, not for mine? Surely not on me can fall the bloody reflection of this murder? By my Almighty Maker, it were better never to have been born than to be the pretext for such a crime!

PRESIDENT. What sayest thou? How? But I will attribute these strange notions to thy romantic brain, Ferdinand; let me not lose my temper- ungrateful boy! Thus dost thou repay me for my sleepless nights? Thus for my restless anxiety to promote thy good? Thus for the never-dying scorpion of my conscience? Upon me must fall the burden of responsibility; upon me the curse, the thunderbolt of the Judge. Thou receivest thy fortune from another's hand-the crime is not attached to the inheritance.

FERDINAND (extending his right hand towards heaven). Here I solemnly abjure an inheritance which must ever remind me of a parent's guilt!

PRESIDENT. Hear me, sirrah! And do not incense me! Were you left to your own direction you would crawl through life in the dust.

FERDINAND. Oh! Better, father, far, far better, than to crawl about a throne!

PRESIDENT (repressing his anger). So! Then compulsion must make you sensible of your good fortune! To that point, which, with the utmost striving a thousand others fail to reach, you have been exalted in your very sleep. At twelve you received a commission;at twenty a command. I have succeeded in obtaining for you the duke's patronage. He bids you lay aside your uniform, and share with me his favor and his confidence. He spoke of titles-embassies-of honors bestowed but upon few. A glorious prospect spreads itself before you! The direct path to the place next the throne lies open to you! Nay, to the throne itself, if the actual power of ruling is equivalent to the mere symbol. Does not that idea awaken your ambition?

FERDINAND. No! My ideas of greatness and happiness differ widely from yours. Your happiness is but seldom known, except by the misery of others. Envy, terror, hatred are the melancholy mirrors in which the smiles of princes are reflected. Tears, curses, and the wailings of despair, the horrid banquet that feasts your supposed elect of fortune; intoxicated with these they rush headlong into eternity, staggering to the throne of judgment. My ideas of happiness teach me to look for its fountain in myself! All my wishes lie centered in my heart!

PRESIDENT. Masterly! Inimitable! Admirable! The first schooling I have received these thirty years! Pity that the brain at fifty should be so dull at learning! But-that such talent may not rust, I will place one by your side on whom you can practise your harlequinade follies at pleasure. You will resolve-resolve this very day-to take a wife.

FERDINAND (starting back amazed). Father!

PRESIDENT. Answer me not. I have made proposals, in your name, to Lady Milford. You will instantly determine upon going to her, and declaring yourself her bridegroom.

FERDINAND. Lady Milford! Father?

PRESIDENT. I presume she is not unknown to you!

FERDINAND (passionately). To what brothel is she unknown through the dukedom? But pardon me, dearest father! It is ridiculous to imagine that your proposal can be serious. Would you call yourself father of that infamous son who married a licensed prostitute?

PRESIDENT. Nay, more. I would ask her hand myself, if she would take a man of fifty. Would not you call yourself that infamous father's son?

FERDINAND. No! As God lives! That would I not!

PRESIDENT. An audacity, by my honor! Which I pardon for its excessive singularity.

FERDINAND. I entreat you, father, release me from a demand which would render it insupportable to call myself your son.

PRESIDENT. Are you distracted, boy? What reasonable man would not thirst after a distinction which makes him, as one of a trio, the equal and co-partner of his sovereign?

FERDINAND. You are quite an enigma to me, father! “A distinction,”do you call it? A distinction to share that with a prince, wherein he places himself on a level with the meanest of his subjects? (The PRESIDENT bursts into a loud laugh.) You may scoff-I must submit to it in a father. With what countenance should I support the gaze of the meanest laborer, who at least receives an undivided person as the portion of his bride? With what countenance should I present myself before the world? Before the prince? Nay, before the harlot herself, who seeks to wash out in my shame the brandmarks of her honor?

PRESIDENT. Where in the world couldst thou collect such notions, boy?

FERDINAND. I implore you, father, by heaven and earth! By thus sacrificing your only son you can never become so happy as you will make him miserable! If my life can be a step to your advancement, dispose of it. My life you gave me; and I will never hesitate a moment to sacrifice it wholly to your welfare. But my honor, father! If you deprive me of this, the giving me life was a mere trick of wanton cruelty, and I must equally curse the parent and the pander.

PRESIDENT (tapping him on the shoulder in a friendly manner). That's as it should be, my dear boy! Now I see that you are a brave and noble fellow, and worthy of the first woman in the dukedom. You shall have her. This very day you shall be affianced to the Countess of Ostheim.

FERDINAND (in new disorder). Is this, then, destined to be the hour of my destruction?

PRESIDENT (regarding him with an eye of suspicion). In this union, I imagine, you can have no objection on the score of honor?

FERDINAND. None, father, none whatever. Frederica of Ostheim would make any other the happiest of men. (Aside, in the greatest agitation.) His kindness rends in pieces that remnant of my heart which his cruelty left unwounded.

PRESIDENT (his eye still fixed upon him). I expect your gratitude, Ferdinand!

FERDINAND (rushes towards him and kisses his hands). Father, your goodness awakens every spark of sentiment in my bosom. Father!Receive my warmest thanks for your kind intentions. Your choice is unexceptionable! But I cannot-I dare not-pity me, father, I never can love the countess.

PRESIDENT (draws back). Ha! Ha! Now I've caught you, young gentleman! The cunning fox has tumbled into the trap. Oh, you artful hypocrite! It was not then honor which made you refuse Lady Milford? It was not the woman, but the nuptials which alarmed you! (FERDINAND stands petrified for a moment; then recovers himself and prepares to quit the chamber hastily.) Whither now? Stay, sir. Is this the respect due to your father? (FERDINAND returns slowly.) Her ladyship expects you. The duke has my promise! Both court and city believe all is settled. If thou makest me appear a liar, boy! If, before the duke-the lady-the court and city-thou shouldst make me appear a liar!-tremble, boy!-or when I have gained information of certain circumstances-how now? Why does the color so suddenly forsake your cheeks?

FERDINAND (pale and trembling). How? What? Nothing-it is nothing, my father!

PRESIDENT (casting upon him a dreadful look). Should there be cause.If I should discover the source whence this obstinacy proceeds!Boy! Boy! The very suspicion drives me distracted! Leave me this moment. 'Tis now the hour of parade. As soon as the word is given, go thou to her ladyship. At my nod a dukedom trembles; we shall see whether a disobedient son dare dispute my will! (Going, returns.) Remember, sir! Fail not to wait on Lady Milford, or dread my anger!

[Exit.



FERDINAND (awakens, as if from a dream). Is he gone? Was that a father's voice? Yes, I will go-I will see her-I will say such things to her-hold such a mirror before her eyes. Then, base woman, shouldst thou still demand my hand-in the presence of the assembled nobles, the military, and the people-gird thyself with all the pride of thy native Britain-I, a German youth, will spurn thee!

[Exit.





ACT II.





SCENE I.


A room in LADY MILFORD's house. On the right of the stage stands a sofa, on the left a pianoforte.



LADY MILFORD, in a loose but elegant negligee, is running her hand over the keys of the pianoforte as SOPHY advances from the window.





SOPHY. The parade is over, and the officers are separating, but I see no signs of the major.

LADY MILFORD (rises and walks up and down the room in visible agitation). I know not what ails me today, Sophy! I never felt so before-you say you do not see him! It is evident enough that he is by no means impatient for this meeting-my heart feels oppressed as if by some heavy crime. Go! Sophy, order the most spirited horse in the stable to be saddled for me-I must away into the open air where I may look on the blue sky and hear the busy hum of man. I must dispel this gloominess by change and motion.

SOPHY. If you feel out of spirits, my lady, why not invite company!Let the prince give an entertainment here, or have the ombre table brought to you. If the prince and all his court were at my beck and call I would let no whim or fancy trouble me!

LADY MILFORD (throwing herself on the couch). Pray, spare me.I would gladly give a jewel in exchange for every hour's respite from the infliction of such company! I always have my rooms tapestried with these creatures! Narrow-minded, miserable beings, who are quite shocked if by chance a candid and heartfelt word should escape one's lips! And stand aghast as though they saw an apparition; slaves, moved by a single puppet-wire, which I can govern as easily as the threads of my embroidery! What can I have in common with such insipid wretches, whose souls, like their watches, are regulated by machinery? What pleasure can I have in the society of people whose answers to my questions I know beforehand? How can I hold communion with men who dare not venture on an opinion of their own lest it should differ from mine!Away with them-I care not to ride a horse that has not spirit enough to champ the bit! (Goes to the window.)

SOPHY. But surely, my lady, you except the prince, the handsomest, the wittiest, and the most gallant man in all his duchy.

LADY MILFORD (returning). Yes, in his duchy, that was well said-and it is only a royal duchy, Sophy, that could in the least excuse my weakness. You say the world envies me! Poor thing! It should rather pity me! Believe me, of all who drink of the streams of royal bounty there is none more miserable than the sovereign's favorite, for he who is great and mighty in the eyes of others comes to her but as the humble suppliant! It is true that by the talisman of his greatness he can realize every wish of my heart as readily as the magician calls forth the fairy palace from the depths of the earth!He can place the luxuries of both Indies upon my table, turn the barren wilderness to a paradise, can bid the broad rivers of his land play in triumphal arches over my path, or expend all the hard-earned gains of his subjects in a single feu-de-joie to my honor. But can he school his heart to respond to one great or ardent emotion?Can he extort one noble thought from his weak and indigent brain? Alas! My heart is thirsting amid all this ocean of splendor;what avail, then, a thousand virtuous sentiments when I am only permitted to indulge in the pleasures of the senses.

SOFHY (regarding her with surprise). Dear lady, you amaze me! How long is it since I entered your service?

LADY MILFORD. Do you ask because this is the first day on which you have learnt to know me? I have sold my honor to the prince, it is true, but my heart is still my own-a heart, dear Sophy, which even yet may be worth the acceptance of an honorable man-a heart over which the pestilential blast of courtly corruption has passed as the breath which for a moment dims the mirror's lustre. Believe me my spirit would long since have revolted against this miserable thraldom could my ambition have submitted to see another advanced to my place.

SOPHY. And could a heart like yours so readily surrender itself to mere ambition?

LADY MILFORD (with energy). Has it not already been avenged?Nay, is it not even at this very moment making me pay a heavy atonement? (with emphasis laying her hand on SOPHY's shoulder)Believe me, Sophy, woman has but to choose between ruling and serving, but the utmost joy of power is a worthless possession if the mightier joy of being slave to the man we love be denied us.

SOPHY. A truth, dear lady, which I could least of all have expected to hear from your lips!

LADY MILFORD. And wherefore, Sophy? Does not woman show, by her childish mode of swaying the sceptre of power, that she is only fit to go in leading-strings! Have not my fickle humors-my eager pursuit of wild dissipation-betrayed to you that I sought in these to stifle the still wilder throbbings of my heart?

SOPHY (starting back with surprise). This from you, my lady?

LADY MILFORD (continuing with increasing energy). Appease these throbbings. Give me the man in whom my thoughts are centered-the man I adore, without whom life were worse than death. Let me but hear from his lips that the tears of love with which my eyes are bedewed outvie the gems that sparkle in my hair, and I will throw at the feet of the prince his heart and his dukedom, and flee to the uttermost parts of the earth with the man of my love!

SOPHY (looking at her in alarm). Heavens! My lady! Control your emotion——

LADY MILFORD (in surprise). You change color! To what have I given utterance? Yet, since I have said thus much, let me say still more-let my confidence be a pledge of your fidelity-I will tell you all.

SOPHY (looking anxiously around). I fear my lady-I dread it-I have heard enough!

LADY MILFORD. This alliance with the major-you, like the rest of the world, believe to be the result of a court intrigue-Sophy, blush not-be not ashamed of me-it is the work of-my love!

SOPHY. Heavens! As I suspected!

LADY MILFORD. Yes, Sophy, they are all deceived. The weak prince-the diplomatic baron-the silly marshal-each and all of these are firmly convinced that this marriage is a most infallible means of preserving me to the prince, and of uniting us still more firmly! But this will prove the very means of separating us forever, and bursting asunder these execrable bonds. The cheater cheated-outwitted by a weak woman. Ye yourselves are leading me to the man of my heart-this was all I sought. Let him but once be mine-be but mine-then, oh, then, a long farewell to all this despicable pomp!





SCENE II.


An old valet of the DUKE's, with a casket of jewels. The former.





VALET. His serene highness begs your ladyship's acceptance of these jewels as a nuptial present. They have just arrived from Venice.

LADY MILFORD (opens the casket and starts back in astonishment). What did these jewels cost the duke?

VALET. Nothing!

LADY MILFORD. Nothing! Are you beside yourself? (retreating a step or two.) Old man! You fix on me a look as though you would pierce me through. Did you say these precious jewels cost nothing?

VALET. Yesterday seven thousand children of the land left their homes to go to America-they pay for all.

LADY MILFORD (sets the casket suddenly down, and paces up and down the room; after a pause, to the VALET). What distresses you, old man? You are weeping!

VALET (wiping his eyes, and trembling violently). Yes, for these jewels.My two sons are among the number.

LADY MILFORD. But they went not by compulsion?

VALET (laughing bitterly). Oh! Dear no! They were all volunteers!There were certainly some few forward lads who pushed to the front of the ranks and inquired of the colonel at what price the prince sold his subjects per yoke, upon which our gracious ruler ordered the regiments to be marched to the parade, and the malcontents to be shot. We heard the report of the muskets, and saw brains and blood spurting about us, while the whole band shouted-“Hurrah for America!”

LADY MILFORD. And I heard nothing of all this! Saw nothing!

VALET. No, most gracious lady, because you rode off to the bear-hunt with his highness just at the moment the drum was beating for the march. 'Tis a pity your ladyship missed the pleasure of the sight-here, crying children might be seen following their wretched father-there, a mother distracted with grief was rushing forward to throw her tender infant among the bristling bayonets-here, a bride and bridegroom were separated with the sabre's stroke-and there, graybeards were seen to stand in despair, and fling their very crutches after their sons in the New World -and, in the midst of all this, the drums were beating loudly, that the prayers and lamentations might not reach the Almighty ear.

LADY MILFORD (rising in violent emotion). Away with these jewels-their rays pierce my bosom like the flames of hell.Moderate your grief, old man. Your children shall be restored to you. You shall again clasp them to your bosom.

VALET (with warmth). Yes, heaven knows! We shall meet again! As they passed the city gates they turned round and cried aloud: “God bless our wives and children-long life to our gracious sovereign.At the day of judgment we shall all meet again!”

LADY MILFORD (walks up and down the room in great agitation).Horrible! Most horrible!-And they would persuade me that I had dried up all the tears in the land. Now, indeed, my eyes are fearfully opened! Go-tell the prince that I will thank him in person! (As the valet is going she drops the purse into his hat.) And take this as a recompense for the truth you have revealed to me.

VALET (throws the purse with contempt on the table). Keep it, with your other treasures. [Exit.

LADY MILFORD (looking after him in astonishment). Sophy, follow him, and inquire his name. His sons shall be restored to him.(SOPHY goes. LADY MILFORD becomes absorbed in thought.Pause. Then to SOPHY as she returns.) Was there not a report that some town on the frontier had been destroyed by fire, and four hundred families reduced to beggary? (She rings.)

SOPHY. What has made your ladyship just think of that? Yes-such was certainly the fact, and most of these poor creatures are either compelled to serve their creditors as bondsmen, or are dragging out their miserable days in the depths of the royal silver mines.

Enter a SERVANT. What are your ladyship's commands?

LADY MILFORD (giving him the case of jewels). Carry this to my treasurer without delay. Let the jewels be sold and the money distributed among the four hundred families who were ruined by the fire.

SOPHY. Consider, my lady, the risk you run of displeasing his highness.

LADY MILFORD (with dignity). Should I encircle my brows with the curses of his subjects? (Makes a sign to the servant, who goes away with the jewel case.) Wouldst thou have me dragged to the earth by the dreadful weight of the tears of misery? Nay! Sophy, it is better far to wear false jewels on the brow, and to have the consciousness of a good deed within the breast!

SOPHY. But diamonds of such value! Why not rather give some that are less precious? Truly, my lady, it is an unpardonable act.

LADY MILFORD. Foolish girl! For this deed more brilliants and pearls will flow for me in one moment than kings ever wore in their richest diadems! Ay, and infinitely more beautiful!

SERVANT (enters.) Major von Walter!

SOPHY (running hastily to the help of LADY MILFORD, who seems fainting). Heavens, my lady, you change color!

LADY MILFORD. The first man who ever made me tremble. (To the SERVANT.) I am not well-but stay-what said the major?-how?O Sophy! I look sadly ill, do I not?

SOPHY. I entreat you, my lady, compose yourself.

SERVANT. Is it your ladyship's wish that I should deny you to the major?

LADY MILFORD (hesitating). Tell him-I shall be happy to see him. (Exit SERVANT.) What shall I say to him, Sophy? how shall I receive him? I will be silent-alas! I fear he will despise my weakness. He will-ah, me! what sad forebodings oppress my heart! You are going Sophy! stay, yet-no, no-he comes-yes, stay, stay with me——

SOPHY. Collect yourself, my lady, the major——





SCENE III.


FERDINAND VON WALTER. The former.





FERDINAND (with a slight bow). I hope I do not interrupt your ladyship?

LADY MILFORD (with visible emotion). Not at all, baron-not in the least.

FERDINAND. I wait on your ladyship, at the command of my father.

LADY MILFORD. Therein I am his debtor.

FERDINAND. And I am charged to announce to you that our marriage is determined on. Thus far I fulfil the commission of my father.

LADY MILFORD (changing color and trembling). And not of your own heart?

FERDINAND. Ministers and panders have no concern with hearts.

LADY MILFORD (almost speechless with emotion). And you yourself-have you nothing to add?

FERDINAND (looking at SOPHY). Much! My lady, much!

LADY MILFORD (motions to SOPHY to withdraw). May I beg you to take a seat by my side?

FERDINAND. I will be brief, lady.

LADY MILFORD. Well!

FERDINAND. I am a man of honor!

LADY MILFORD. Whose worth I know how to appreciate.

FERDINAND. I am of noble birth!

LADY MILFORD. Noble as any in the land!

FERDINAND. A soldier!

LADY MILFORD (in a soft, affectionate manner). Thus far you have only enumerated advantages which you share in common with many others. Why are you so silent regarding those noble qualities which are peculiarly your own?

FERDINAND (coldly). Here they would be out of place.

LADY MILFORD (with increasing agitation). In what light am I to understand this prelude?

FERDINAND (slowly, and with emphasis). As the protest of the voice of honor-should you think proper to enforce the possession of my hand!

LADY MILFORD (starting with indignation). Major von Walter! What language is this?

FERDINAND (calmly). The language of my heart-of my unspotted name-and of this true sword.

LADY MILFORD. Your sword was given to you by the prince.

FERDINAND. 'Twas the state which gave it, by the hands of the prince. God bestowed on me an honest heart. My nobility is derived from a line of ancestry extending through centuries.

LADY MILFORD. But the authority of the prince——

FERDINAND (with warmth). Can he subvert the laws of humanity, or stamp glory on our actions as easily as he stamps value on the coin of his realm? He himself is not raised above the laws of honor, although he may stifle its whispers with gold-and shroud his infamy in robes of ermine! But enough of this, lady!-It is too late now to talk of blasted prospects-or of the desecration of ancestry-or of that nice sense of honor-girded on with my sword-or of the world's opinion. All these I am ready to trample under foot as soon as you have proved to me that the reward is not inferior to the sacrifice.

LADY MILFORD (in extreme distress turning away). Major! I have not deserved this!

FERDINAND (taking her hand). Pardon me, lady-we are without witnesses. The circumstance which brings us together today-and only today-justifies me, nay, compels me, to reveal to you my most secret feelings. I cannot comprehend, lady, how a being gifted with so much beauty and spirit-qualities which a man cannot fail to admire-could throw herself away on a prince incapable of valuing aught beyond her mere person-and yet not feel some visitings of shame, when she steps forth to offer her heart to a man of honor!

LADY MILFORD (looking at him with an air of pride). Say on, sir, without reserve.

FERDINAND. You call yourself an Englishwoman-pardon me, lady, I can hardly believe you. The free-born daughter of the freest people under heaven-a people too proud to imitate even foreign virtues-would surely never have sold herself to foreign vices! It is not possible, lady, that you should be a native of Britain, unless indeed your heart be as much below as the sons of Britannia vaunt theirs to be above all others!

LADY MILFORD. Have you done, sir?

FERDINAND. Womanly vanity-passions-temperament-a natural appetite for pleasure-all these might, perhaps, be pleaded in extenuation-for virtue often survives honor-and many who once trod the paths of infamy have subsequently reconciled themselves to society by the performance of noble deeds, and have thus thrown a halo of glory round their evil doings-but if this were so, whence comes the monstrous extortion that now oppresses the people with a weight never before known? This I would ask in the name of my fatherland-and now, lady, I have done!

LADY MILFORD (with gentleness and dignity). This is the first time, Baron von Walter, that words such as these have been addressed to me-and you are the only man to whom I would in return have vouchsafed an answer. Your rejection of my hand commands my esteem. Your invectives against my heart have my full forgiveness, for I will not believe you sincere, since he who dares hold such language to a woman, that could ruin him in an instant-must either believe that she possesses a great and noble heart- or must be the most desperate of madmen. That you ascribe the misery of this land to me may He forgive, before whose throne you, and I, and the prince shall one day meet! But, as in my person you have insulted the daughter of Britain, so in vindication of my country's honor you must hear my exculpation.

FERDINAND (leaning on his sword). Lady, I listen with interest.

LADY MILFORD. Hear, then, that which I have never yet breathed to mortal, and which none but yourself will ever learn from my lips. I am not the low adventurer you suppose me, sir! Nay! Did I listen to the voice of pride, I might even boast myself to be of royal birth; I am descended from the unhappy Thomas Norfolk, who paid the penalty of his adherence to the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots, by a bloody death on the scaffold. My father, who, as royal chamberlain, had once enjoyed his sovereign's confidence, was accused of maintaining treasonable relations with France, and was condemned and executed by a decree of the Parliament of Great Britain. Our estates were confiscated, and our family banished from their native soil. My mother died on the day of my father's execution, and I-then a girl of fourteen-fled to Germany with one faithful attendant. A casket of jewels, and this crucifix, placed in my bosom by my dying mother, were all my fortune![FERDINAND, absorbed in thought, surveys LADY MILFORD with looks of compassion and sympathy.

LADY MILFORD (continuing with increased emotion). Without a name-without protection or property-a foreigner and an orphan, I reached Hamburg. I had learnt nothing but a little French, and to run my fingers over the embroidery frame, or the keys of my harpsichord. But, though I was ignorant of all useful arts, I had learnt full well to feast off gold and silver, to sleep beneath silken hangings, to bid attendant pages obey my voice, and to listen to the honeyed words of flattery and adulation. Six years passed away in sorrow and in sadness-the remnant of my scanty means was fast melting away-my old and faithful nurse was no more-and-and then it was that fate brought your sovereign to Hamburg. I was walking beside the shores of the Elbe, wondering, as I gazed on its waters, whether they or my sorrows were the deeper, when the duke crossed my path. He followed me, traced me to my humble abode, and, casting himself at my feet, vowed that he loved me.(She pauses, and, after struggling with her emotion, continues in a voice choked by tears.) All the images of my happy childhood were revived in hues of delusive brightness-while the future lowered before me black as the grave. My heart panted for communion with another-and I sank into the arms opened to receive me! (Turning away.) And now you condemn me!

FERDINAND (greatly agitated, follows her and leads her back). Lady!Heavens! What do I hear! What have I done? The guilt of my conduct is unveiled in all its deformity! It is impossible you should forgive me.

LADY MILFORD (endeavoring to overcome her emotion). Hear me on! The prince, it is true, overcame my unprotected youth, but the blood of the Howards still glowed within my veins, and never ceased to reproach me; that I, the descendant of royal ancestors, should stoop to be a prince's paramour! Pride and destiny still contended in my bosom, when the duke brought me hither, where SCENEs the most revolting burst upon my sight! The voluptuousness of the great is an insatiable hyena-the craving of whose appetite demands perpetual victims. Fearfully had it laid this country waste separating bridegroom and bride-and tearing asunder even the holy bonds of marriage. Here it had destroyed the tranquil happiness of a whole family-there the blighting pest had seized on a young and inexperienced heart, and expiring victims called down bitter imprecations on the heads of the undoers. It was then that I stepped forth between the lamb and the tiger, and, in a moment of dalliance, extorted from the duke his royal promise that this revolting licentiousness should cease.

FERDINAND (pacing the room in violent agitation). No more, lady! No more!

LADY MILFORD. This gloomy period was succeeded by one still more gloomy. The court swarmed with French and Italian adventurers-the royal sceptre became the plaything of Parisian harlots, and the people writhed and bled beneath their capricious rule. Each had her day. I saw them sink before me, one by one, for I was the most skilful coquette of all! It was then that I seized and wielded the tyrant's sceptre whilst he slumbered voluptuously in my embrace-then, Walter, thy country, for the first time, felt the hand of humanity, and reposed in confidence on my bosom. (A pause, during which she gazes upon him with tenderness.) Oh! 'That the man, by whom, of all others, I least wish to be misunderstood, should compel me to turn braggart and parade my unobtrusive virtues to the glare of admiration! Walter, I have burst open the doors of prisons-I have cancelled death-warrants and shortened many a frightful eternity upon the galleys. Into wounds beyond my power to heal I have at least poured soothing balsam. I have hurled mighty villains to the earth, and oft with the tears of a harlot saved the cause of innocence from impending ruin. Ah! Young man, how sweet were then my feelings! How proudly did these actions teach my heart to support the reproaches of my noble blood! And now comes the man who alone can repay me for all that I have suffered-the man, whom perhaps my relenting destiny created as a compensation for former sorrows-the man, whom with ardent affection, I already clasped in my dreams.

FERDINAND (interrupting her). Hold, lady, hold! You exceed the bounds of our conference! You undertook to clear yourself from reproach, and you make me a criminal! Spare me, I beseech you!Spare a heart already overwhelmed by confusion and remorse!

LADY MILFORD (grasping his hand). You must hear me, Walter!Hear me now or never. Long enough has the heroine sustained me; now you must feel the whole weight of these tears! Mark me, Walter! Should an unfortunate-impetuously, irresistibly attracted towards you-clasp you to her bosom full of unutterable, inextinguishable love-should this unfortunate-bowed down with the consciousness of shame-disgusted with vicious pleasures-heroically exalted by the inspiration of virtue-throw herself-thus into your arms (embracing him in an eager and supplicating manner); should she do this, and you still pronounce the freezing word “Honor!” Should she pray that through you she might be saved-that through you she might be restored to her hopes of heaven! (Turning away her head, and speaking in a hollow, faltering voice.) Or should she, her prayer refused, listen to the voice of despair, and to escape from your image plunge herself into yet more fearful depths of infamy and vice——

FERDINAND (breaking from her in great emotion). No, by heaven!This is more than I can endure! Lady, I am compelled-Heaven and earth compels me-to make the honest avowal of my sentiments and situation.

LADY MILFORD (hastening from him). Oh! Not now! By all that is holy I entreat you-spare me in this dreadful moment when my lacerated heart bleeds from a thousand wounds. Be your decision life or death-I dare not-I will not hear it!

FERDINAND. I entreat you, lady! I insist! What I have to say will mitigate my offence, and warmly plead your forgiveness for the past. I have been deceived in you, lady. I expected-nay, I wished to find you deserving my contempt. I came determined to insult you, and to make myself the object of your hate. Happy would it have been for us both had my purpose succeeded! (He pauses; then proceeds in a gentle and faltering voice.) Lady, I love!-I love a maid of humble birth-Louisa Miller is her name, the daughter of a music-master. (LADY MILFORD turns away pale and greatly agitated.) I know into what an abyss I plunge myself; but, though prudence bids me conceal my passion, honor overpowers its precepts. I am the criminal-I first destroyed the golden calm of Louisa's innocence-I lulled her heart with aspiring hopes, and surrendered it, like a betrayer, a prey to the wildest of passions.You will bid me remember my rank-my birth-my father-schemes of aggrandisement. But in vain-I love! My hopes become more fervent as the breach widens between nature and the mere conventions of society- between my resolution and worldly prejudices! We shall see whether love or interest is victorious.(LADY MILFORD during this has retired to the extreme end of the apartment, and covers her face with both hands. FERDINAND approaches her.) Have you aught to answer, lady?

LADY MILFORD (in a tone of intense suffering). Nothing! Nothing!But that you destroy yourself and me-and, with us yet a third.

FERDINAND. A third?

LADY MILFORD. Never can you marry Louisa; never can you be happy with me. We shall all be the victims of your father's rashness. I can never hope to possess the heart of a husband who has been forced to give me his hand.

FERDINAND. Forced, lady? Forced? And yet given? Will you enforce a hand without a heart? Will you tear from a maiden a man who is the whole world to her? Will you tear a maiden from a man who has centered all his hopes of happiness on her alone? Will you do this, lady? You who but a moment before were the lofty, noble-minded daughter of Britain?

LADY MILFORD. I will because I must! (earnestly and firmly). My passions, Walter, overcome my tenderness for you. My honor has no alternative. Our union is the talk of the whole city. Every eye, every shaft of ridicule is bent against me. 'Twere a stain which time could never efface should a subject of the prince reject my hand! Appease your father if you have the power! Defend yourself as you best may! My resolution is taken. The mine is fired and I abide the issue.

[Exit. FERDINAND remains in speechless astonishment for some moments; then rushes wildly out.





SCENE IV.


Miller's House. MILLER meeting LOUISA and MRS. MILLER.





MILLER. Ay! Ay! I told you how it would be!

LOUISA (hastening to him with anxiety). What, father? What?

MILLER (running up and down the room). My cloak, there. Quick, quick! I must be beforehand with him. My cloak, I say! Yes, yes!This was just what I expected!

LOUISA. For God's sake, father! Tell me?

MRS. MILLER. What is the matter, Miller? What alarms you?

MILLER (throwing down his wig). Let that go to the friezer. What is the matter, indeed? And my beard, too, is nearly half an inch long.What's the matter? What do you think, you old carrion. The devil has broke loose, and you may look out for squalls.

MRS. MILLER. There, now, that's just the way! When anything goes wrong it is always my fault.

MILLER. Your fault? Yes, you brimstone fagot! And whose else should it be? This very morning when you were holding forth about that confounded major, did I not say then what would be the consequence? That knave, Worm, has blabbed.

MRS. MILLER. Gracious heavens! But how do you know?

MILLER. How do I know? Look yonder! A messenger of the minister is already at the door inquiring for the fiddler.

LOUISA (turning pale, and sitting down). Oh! God! I am in agony!

MILLER. And you, too, with that languishing air? (laughs bitterly).But, right! Right! There is an old saying that where the devil keeps a breeding-cage he is sure to hatch a handsome daughter.

MRS. MILLER. But how do you know that Louisa is in question? You may have been recommended to the duke; he may want you in his orchestra.

MILLER (jumping up, and seizing his fiddlestick). May the sulphurous rain of hell consume thee! Orchestra, indeed! Ay, where you, you old procuress, shall howl the treble whilst my smarting back groans the base (Throwing himself upon a chair.) Oh! God in heaven!

LOUISA (sinks on the sofa, pale as death). Father! Mother! Oh! My heart sinks within me.

MILLER (starting up with anger). But let me only lay hands on that infernal quill-driver! I'll make him skip-be it in this world or the next; if I don't pound him to a jelly, body and soul; if I don't write all the Ten Commandments, the seven Penitential Psalms, the five books of Moses, and the whole of the Prophets upon his rascally hide so distinctly that the blue hieroglyphics shall be legible at the day of judgment-if I don't, may I——

MRS. MILLER. Yes, yes, curse and swear your hardest! That's the way to frighten the devil! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, gracious heavens! What shall we do? Who can advise us? Speak, Miller, speak; this silence distracts me! (She runs screaming up and down the room.)

MILLER. I will instantly to the minister! I will open my mouth boldly, and tell him all from beginning to end. You knew it before me, and ought to have given me a hint of what was going on! The girl might yet have been advised. It might still have been time to save her! But, no! There was something for your meddling and making, and you must needs add fuel to the fire. Now you have made your bed you may lie on it. As you have brewed so you may drink; I shall take my daughter under my arm and be off with her over the borders.





SCENE V.


MILLER, MRS. MILLER, LOUISA, FERDINND.





(All speaking together).

FERDINAND (rushes in, terrified, and out of breath). Has my father been here?

LOUISA (starts back in horror). His father? Gracious heaven!

MRS. MILLER (wringing her hands). The minister here? Then it's all over with us!

MILLER (laughs bitterly). Thank God! Thank God! Now comes our benefit!

FERDINAND (rushing towards LOUISA, and clasping her in his arms). Mine thou art, though heaven and hell were placed between us!

LOUISA. I am doomed! Speak, Ferdinand! Did you not utter that dreaded name? Your father?

FERDINAND. Be not alarmed! The danger has passed! I have thee again! Again thou hast me! Let me regain my breath on thy dear bosom. It was a dreadful hour!

LOUISA. What was a dreadful hour? Answer me, Ferdinand! I die with apprehension!

FERDINAND (drawing back, gazing upon her earnestly, then in a solemn tone). An hour, Louisa, when another's form stepped between my heart and thee-an hour in which my love grew pale before my conscience-when Louisa ceased to be all in all to Ferdinand!

[LOUISA sinks back upon her chair, and conceals her face.



(FERDINAND stands before her in speechless agitation, then turns away from her suddenly and exclaims). Never, never! Baroness, 'tis impossible! You ask too much! Never can I sacrifice this innocence at your shrine. No, by the eternal God! I cannot recall my oath, which speaks to me from thy soul-thrilling eyes louder than the thunders of heaven! Behold, lady! Inhuman father, look on this!Would you have me destroy this angel? Shall my perfidy kindle a hell in this heavenly bosom? (turning towards her with firmness).No! I will bear her to thy throne, Almighty Judge! Thy voice shall declare if my affection be a crime. (He grasps her hand, and raises her from the sofa.) Courage, my beloved!-thou hast conquered-and I come forth a victor from the terrible conflict!

LOUISA. No, no, Ferdinand, conceal nothing from me! Declare boldly the dreadful decree! You named your father! You spoke of the baroness! The shivering of death seizes my heart! 'Tis said she is about to be married!

FERDINAND (quite overcome, throws himself at her feet). Yes, and to me, dear unfortunate. Such is my father's will!

LOUISA (after a deep pause, in a tremulous voice, but with assumed resignation). Well! Why am I thus affrighted? Has not my dear father often told me that you never could be mine? But I was obstinate, and believed him not. (A second pause; she falls weeping into her father's arms.) Father, thy daughter is thine own again!Father, forgive me! 'Twas not your child's fault that the dream was so heavenly-the waking so terrible!

MILLER. Louisa! Louisa! O merciful heaven! She has lost her senses!My daughter! My poor child! Curses upon thy seducer! Curses upon the pandering mother who threw thee in his way!

MRS. MILLER (weeping on LOUISA's neck). Daughter, do I deserve this curse? God forgive you, major! What has this poor lamb done that you bring this misery upon her?

FERDINAND (with resolution). I will unravel the meshes of these intrigues. I will burst asunder these iron chains of prejudice. As a free-born man will I make my choice, and crush these insect souls with the colossal force of my love! [Going.

LOUISA (rises trembling from the sofa, and attempts to follow him). Stay, oh, stay! Whither are you going? Father! Mother! He deserts us in this fearful hour!

MRS. MILLER (hastens towards him, and detains him). The president is coming hither? He will ill-use my child! He will ill-use us all,-and yet, major, you are going to leave us.

MILLER (laughs hysterically). Leave us. Of course he is! What should hinder him? The girl has given him all she had. (Grasping FERDINAND with one hand, and LOUISA with the other.) Listen to me, young gentleman. The only way out of my house is over my daughter's body. If you possess one single spark of honor await your father's coming; tell him, deceiver, how you stole her young and inexperienced heart; or, by the God who made me! (thrusting LOUISA towards him with violence and passion) You shall crush before my eyes this trembling worm whom love for you has brought to shame and infamy!

FERDINAND (returns, and walks to and fro in deep thought). 'Tis true, the President's power is great-parental authority is a mighty word-even crimes claim respect when concealed within its folds.He may push that authority far-very far! But love goes beyond it.Hear me, Louisa; give me thy hand! (clasping it firmly). As surely as I hope for Heaven's mercy in my dying hour, I swear that the moment which separates these hands shall also rend asunder the thread that binds me to existence!

LOUISA. You terrify me! Turn from me! Your lips tremble! Your eyes roll fearfully!

FERDINAND. Nay, Louisa! Fear nothing! It is not madness which prompts my oath! 'Tis the choicest gift of Heaven, decision, sent to my aid at that critical moment, when an oppressed bosom can only find relief in some desperate remedy. I love thee, Louisa! Thou shalt be mine! 'Tis resolved! And now for my father!

[He rushes out, and is met by the PRESIDENT.





SCENE VI.


MILLER, MRS. MILLER, LOUISA, FERDINAND, PRESIDENT, with SERVANTS.





PRESIDENT (as he enters). So! Here he is! (All start in terror.)

FERDINAND (retiring a few paces). In the house of innocence!

PRESIDENT. Where a son learns obedience to his father!

FERDINAND. Permit me to——

PRESIDENT (interrupting him, turns to MILLER). The father, I presume?

MILLER. I am Miller, the musician.

PRESIDENT (to MRS. MILLER). And you, the mother?

MRS. MILLER. Yes, alas! Her unfortunate mother!

FERDINAND (to MILLER.) Father, take Louisa to her chamber-she is fainting.

PRESIDENT. An unnecessary precaution! I will soon arouse her. (To LOUISA.) How long have you been acquainted with the President's son?

LOUISA (with timidity). Of the President's son I have never thought.Ferdinand von Walter has paid his addresses to me since November last.

FERDINAND. And he adores her!

PRESIDENT (to LOUISA). Has he given you any assurance of his love?

FERDINAND. But a few minutes since, the most solemn, and God was my witness.

PRESIDENT (to his son angrily). Silence! You shall have opportunity enough of confessing your folly. (To LOUISA.) I await your answer.

LOUISA. He swore eternal love to me.

FERDINAND. And I will keep my oath.

PRESIDENT (to FERDINAND). Must I command your silence? (To LOUISA). Did you accept his rash vows?

LOUISA (with tenderness). I did, and gave him mine in exchange.

FERDINAND (resolutely). The bond is irrevocable——

PRESIDENT (to FERDINAND). If you dare to interrupt me again I'll teach you better manners. (To LOUISA, sneeringly.) And he paid handsomely every time, no doubt?

LOUISA. I do not understand your question.

PRESIDENT (with an insulting laugh). Oh, indeed! Well, I only meant to hint that-as everything has its price-I hope you have been more provident than to bestow your favors gratis-or perhaps you were satisfied with merely participating in the pleasure? Eh? How was it?

FERDINAND (infuriated). Hell and confusion! What does this mean?

LOUISA (to FERDINAND, with dignity and emotion). Baron von Walter, now you are free!

FERDINAND. Father! Virtue though clothed in a beggar's garb commands respect!

PRESIDENT (laughing aloud). A most excellent joke! The father is commanded to honor his son's strumpet!

LOUISA. Oh! Heaven and earth! (Sinks down in a swoon.)

FERDINAND (drawing his sword). Father, you gave me life, and, till now, I acknowledged your claim on it. That debt is cancelled.(Replaces his sword in the scabbard, and points to LOUISA.) There lies the bond of filial duty torn to atoms!

MILLER (who has stood apart trembling, now comes forward, by turns gnashing his teeth in rage, and shrinking back in terror). Your excellency, the child is the father's second self. No offence, I hope!Who strikes the child hits the father-blow for blow-that's our rule here. No offence, I hope!

MRS. MILLER. God have mercy on us! Now the old man has begun-we shall all catch it with a vengeance!

PRESIDENT (who has not understood what MILLER said). What?Is the old pander stirred up? We shall have something to settle together presently, Mr. Pander!

MILLER. You mistake me, my lord. My name is Miller, at your service for an adagio-but, as to ladybirds, I cannot serve you. As long as there is such an assortment at court, we poor citizens can't afford to lay in stock! No offence, I hope!

MRS. MILLER. For Heaven's sake, man, hold your tongue! Would you ruin both wife and child?

FERDINAND (to his father). You play but a sorry part here, my lord, and might well have dispensed with these witnesses.

MILLER (coming nearer, with increasing confidence). To be plain and above board-No offence, I hope-your excellency may have it all your own way in the Cabinet-but this is my house. I'm your most obedient, very humble servant when I wait upon you with a petition, but the rude, unmannerly intruder I have the right to bundle out-no offence, I hope!

PRESIDENT (pale with anger, and approaching MILLER). What?What's that you dare to utter?

MILLER (retreating a few steps). Only a little bit of my mind sir-no offence, I hope!

PRESIDENT (furiously). Insolent villain! Your impertinence shall procure you a lodging in prison. (To his servants). Call in the officers of justice! Away! (Some of the attendants go out. The PRESIDENT paces the stage with a furious air.) The father shall to prison; the mother and her strumpet daughter to the pillory!Justice shall lend her sword to my rage! For this insult will I have ample amends. Shall such contemptible creatures thwart my plans, and set father and son against each other with impunity? Tremble, miscreants! I will glut my hate in your destruction-the whole brood of you-father, mother, and daughter shall be sacrificed to my vengeance!

FERDINAND (to MILLER, in a collected and firm manner). Oh!Not so! Fear not, friends! I am your protector. (Turning to the PRESIDENT, with deference). Be not so rash, father! For your own sake let me beg of you no violence. There is a corner of my heart where the name of father has never yet been heard. Oh! Press not into that!

PRESIDENT. Silence, unworthy boy! Rouse not my anger to greater fury!

MILLER (recovering from a stupor). Wife, look you to your daughter! I fly to the duke. His highness' tailor-God be praised for reminding me of it at this moment-learns the flute of me-I cannot fail of success. (Is hastening off.)

PRESIDENT. To the duke, will you? Have you forgotten that I am the threshold over which you must pass, or failing, perish? To the duke, you fool? Try to reach him with your lamentations, when, reduced to a living skeleton, you lie buried in a dungeon five fathoms deep, where light and sound never enter; where darkness goggles at hell with gloating eyes! There gnash thy teeth in anguish; there rattle thy chains in despair, and groan, “Woe is me! This is beyond human endurance!”





SCENE VII.


Officers of Justice-the former.





FERDINAND (flies to LOUISA, who, overcome with fear, faints in his arms.) Louisa!-Help, for God's sake! Terror overpowers her![MILLER, catching up his cane and putting on his hat, prepares for defense. MRS. MILLER throws herself on her knees before the PRESIDENT.

PRESIDENT (to the officers, showing his star). Arrest these offenders in the duke's name. Boy, let go that strumpet! Fainting or not-when once her neck is fitted with the iron collar the mob will pelt her till she revives.

MRS. MILLER. Mercy, your excellency! Mercy! Mercy!

MILLER (snatching her from the ground with violence). Kneel to God, you howling fool, and not to villains-since I must to prison any way!

PRESIDENT (biting his lips.) You may be out in your reckoning, scoundrel! There are still gallows to spare! (To the officers.) Must I repeat my orders?

[They approach LOUISA-FERDINAND places himself before her.



FERDINAND (fiercely). Touch her who dare! (He draws his sword and flourishes it.) Let no one presume to lay a finger on her, whose life is not well insured. (To the PRESIDENT.) As you value your own safety, father, urge me no further!

PRESIDENT (to the officers in a threatening voice). At your peril, cowards! (They again attempt to seize LOUISA.)

FERDINAND. Hell and furies! Back, I say! (Driving them away.) Once more, father, I warn you-have some thought for your own safety!Drive me not to extremity!

PRESIDENT (enraged to the officers). Scoundrels! Is this your obedience? (The officers renew their efforts.)

FERDINAND. Well, if it must be so (attacking and wounding several of them), Justice forgive me!

PRESIDENT (exasperated to the utmost). Let me see whether I, too, must feel your weapon! (He seizes LOUISA and delivers her to an officer.)

FERDINAND (laughing bitterly). Father! Father! Your conduct is a galling satire upon Providence, who has so ill understood her people as to make bad statesmen of excellent executioners!

PRESIDENT (to the officers). Away with her!

FERDINAND. Father, if I cannot prevent it, she must stand in the pillory-but by her side will also stand the son of the president. Do you still insist?

PRESIDENT. The more entertaining will be the exhibition. Away with her!

FERDINAND. I will pledge the honor of an officer's sword for her. Do you still insist?

PRESIDENT. Your sword is already familiar with disgrace. Away!Away! You know my will.

FERDINAND (wrests LOUISA from the officer and holds her with one arm, with the other points his sword at her bosom.) Father, rather than tamely see my wife branded with infamy I will plunge this sword into her bosom. Do you still insist?

PRESIDENT. Do it, if the point be sharp enough!

FERDINAND (releases LOUISA, and looks wildly towards heaven).Be thou witness, Almighty God, that I have left no human means untried to save her! Forgive me now if I have recourse to hellish means. While you are leading her to the pillory (speaking loudly in the PRESIDENT's ear), I will publish throughout the town a pleasant history of how a president's chair may be gained! [Exit.

PRESIDENT (as if thunder-struck). How? What said he? Ferdinand!Release her instantly! (Rushes after his son.)





ACT III.





SCENE I.


Room at the President's. Enter PRESIDENT and WORM.





PRESIDENT. That was an infernal piece of business!

WORM. Just what I feared, your excellency. Opposition may inflame the enthusiast, but never converts him.

PRESIDENT. I had placed my whole reliance upon the success of this attempt. I made no doubt but if the girl were once publicly disgraced, he would be obliged as an officer and a gentleman to resign her.

WORM. An admirable idea!-Had you but succeeded in disgracing her.

PRESIDENT. And yet-when I reflect on the matter coolly-I ought not to have suffered myself to be overawed. It was a threat which he never could have meant seriously.

WORM. Be not too certain of that! There is no folly too gross for excited passion! You say that the baron has always looked upon government with an eye of disapprobation. I can readily believe it. The principles which he brought with him from college are ill-suited to our atmosphere. What have the fantastic visions of personal nobility and greatness of soul to do in court, where 'tis the perfection of wisdom to be great and little by turns, as occasion demands? The baron is too young and too fiery to take pleasure in the slow and crooked paths of intrigue. That alone can give impulse to his ambition which seems glorious and romantic!

PRESIDENT (impatiently). But how will these sagacious remarks advance our affairs?

WORM. They will point out to your excellency where the wound lies, and so, perhaps, help you to find a remedy. Such a character- pardon the observation-ought never to have been made a confidant, or should never have been roused to enmity. He detests the means by which you have risen to power! Perhaps it is only the son that has hitherto sealed the lips of the betrayer! Give him but a fair opportunity for throwing off the bonds imposed upon him by nature! only convince him, by unrelenting opposition to his passion, that you are no longer an affectionate father, and that moment the duties of a patriot will rush upon him with irresistible force! Nay, the high-wrought idea of offering so unparalleled a sacrifice at the shrine of justice might of itself alone have charms sufficient to reconcile him to the ruin of a parent!

PRESIDENT. Worm! Worm! To what a horrible abyss do you lead me!

WORM. Never fear, my lord, I will lead you back in safety! May I speak without restraint?

PRESIDENT (throwing himself into a seat). Freely, as felon with felon.

WORM. Forgive me, then. It seems to me that you have to ascribe all your influence as president to the courtly art of intrigue; why not resort to the same means for attaining your ends as a father?I well remember with what seeming frankness you invited your predecessor to a game at piquet, and caroused half the night with him over bumpers of Burgundy; and yet it was the same night on which the great mine you had planned to annihilate him was to explode. Why did you make a public exhibition of enmity to the major? You should by no means have let it appear that you knew anything of his love affair. You should have made the girl the object of your attacks and have preserved the affection of your son; like the prudent general who does not engage the prime of the enemy's force but creates disaffection among the ranks?

PRESIDENT. How could this have been effected?

WORM. In the simplest manner-even now the game is not entirely lost! Forget for a time that you are a father. Do not contend against a passion which opposition only renders more formidable. Leave me to hatch, from the heat of their own passions, the basilisk which shall destroy them.

PRESIDENT. I am all attention.

WORM. Either my knowledge of human character is very small, or the major is as impetuous in jealousy as in love. Make him suspect the girl's constancy-whether probable or not does not signify. One grain of leaven will be enough to ferment the whole mass.

PRESIDENT. But where shall we find that grain?

WORM. Now, then, I come to the point. But first explain to me how much depends upon the major's compliance. How far is it of consequence that the romance with the music-master's daughter should be brought to a conclusion and the marriage with Lady Milford effected?

PRESIDENT. How can you ask me, Worm? If the match with Lady Milford is broken off I stand a fair chance of losing my whole influence; on the other hand, if I force the major's consent, of losing my head.

WORM (with animation). Now have the kindness to listen to me. The major must be entangled in a web. Your whole power must be employed against his mistress. We must make her write a love-letter, address it to a third party, and contrive to drop it cleverly in the way of the major.

PRESIDENT. Absurd proposal! As if she would consent to sign her own death-warrant.

WORM. She must do so if you will but let me follow my own plan.I know her gentle heart thoroughly; she has but two vulnerable sides by which her conscience can be attacked; they are her father and the major. The latter is entirely out of the question; we must, therefore, make the most of the musician.

PRESIDENT. In what way?

WORM. From the description your excellency gave me of what passed in his house nothing can be easier than to terrify the father with the threat of a criminal process. The person of his favorite, and of the keeper of the seals, is in some degree the representative of the duke himself, and he who offends the former is guilty of treason towards the latter. At any rate I will engage with these pretences to conjure up such a phantom as shall scare the poor devil out of his seven senses.

PRESIDENT. But recollect, Worm, the affair must not be carried so far as to become serious.

WORM. Nor shall it. It shall be carried no further than is necessary to frighten the family into our toils. The musician, therefore, must be quietly arrested. To make the necessity yet more urgent, we may also take possession of the mother-and then we begin to talk of criminal process, of the scaffold, and of imprisonment for life, and make the daughter's letter the sole condition of the parent's release.

PRESIDENT. Excellent! Excellent! Now I begin to understand you!

WORM. Louisa loves her father-I might say even to adoration!The danger which threatens his life, or at least his freedom-the reproaches of her conscience for being the cause of his misfortunes-the impossibility of ever becoming the major's wife-the confusion of her brain, which I take upon myself to produce-all these considerations make our plan certain of success.She must be caught in the snare.

PRESIDENT. But my son-will he not instantly get scent of it? Will it not make him yet more desperate?

WORM. Leave that to me, your excellency! The old folks shall not be set at liberty till they and their daughter have taken the most solemn oath to keep the whole transaction secret, and never to confess the deception.

PRESIDENT. An oath! Ridiculous! What restraint can an oath be?

WORM. None upon us, my lord, but the most binding upon people of their stamp. Observe, how dexterously by this measure we shall both reach the goal of our desires. The girl loses at once the affection of her lover, and her good name; the parents will lower their tone, and, thoroughly humbled by misfortune, will esteem it an act of mercy, if, by giving her my hand, I reestablish their daughter's reputation.

PRESIDENT (shaking his head and smiling). Artful villain! I confess myself outdone-no devil could spin a finer snare! The scholar excels his master. The next question is, to whom must the letter be addressed- with whom to accuse her of having an intrigue?

WORM. It must necessarily be some one who has all to gain or all to lose by your son's decision in this affair.

PRESIDENT (after a moment's reflection). I can think of no one but the marshal.

WORM (shrugs his shoulders). The marshal! He would certainly not be my choice were I Louisa Miller.

PRESIDENT. And why not? What a strange notion! A man who dresses in the height of fashion-who carries with him an atmosphere of eau de mille fleurs and musk-who can garnish every silly speech with a handful of ducats-could all this possibly fail to overcome the delicacy of a tradesman's daughter? No, no, my good friend, jealousy is not quite so hard of belief. I shall send for the marshal immediately. (Rings.)

WORM. While your excellency takes care of him, and of the fiddler's arrest, I will go and indite the aforesaid letter.

PRESIDENT (seats himself at his writing-table). Do so; and, as soon as it is ready, bring it hither for my perusal.

[Exit WORM.



[The PRESIDENT, having written, rises and hands the paper to a servant who enters.



See this arrest executed without a moment's delay, and let Marshal von Kalb be informed that I wish to see him immediately.

SERVANT. The marshal's carriage has just stopped at your lordship's door.

PRESIDENT. So much the better-as for the arrest, let it be managed with such precaution that no disturbance arise.

SERVANT. I will take care, my lord.

PRESIDENT. You understand me? The business must be kept quite secret.

SERVANT. Your excellency shall be obeyed.

[Exit SERVANT.





SCENE II.


The PRESIDENT-MARSHALL KALB.





MARSHAL (hastily). I have just looked in, en passant, my dear friend!How are you? How do you get on? We are to have the grand opera Dido to-night! Such a conflagration!-A whole town will be in flames!-You will come to the blaze of course-eh?

PRESIDENT. I have conflagration enough in my own house, one that threatens the destruction of all I possess. Be seated, my dear marshal. You arrive very opportunely to give me your advice and assistance in a certain business which will either advance our fortunes or utterly ruin us both!

MARSHAL. Don't alarm me so, my dear friend!

PRESIDENT. As I said before, it must exalt or ruin us entirely! You know my project respecting the major and Lady Milford-you are not ignorant how necessary this union is to secure both our fortunes! Marshal, our plans threaten to come to naught. My son refuses to marry her!

MARSHAL. Refuses! Refuses to marry her? But, my goodness! I have published the news through the whole town. The union is the general topic of conversation.

PRESIDENT. Then you will be talked of by all the town as a spreader of false reports,-in short, Ferdinand loves another.

MARSHAL. Pooh! You are joking! As if that were an obstacle?

PRESIDENT. With such an enthusiast a most insurmountable one!

MARSHAL. Can he be mad enough to spurn his good-fortune? Eh?

PRESIDENT. Ask him yourself and you'll hear what he will answer.

MARSHAL. But, mon Dieu! what can he answer?

PRESIDENT. That he will publish to the world the crime by which we rose to power-that he will denounce our forged letters and receipts-that he will send us both to the scaffold. That is what he can answer.

MARSHAL. Are you out of your mind?

PRESIDENT. Nay, that is what he has already answered? He was actually on the point of putting these threats into execution; and it was only by the most abject submission that I could persuade him to abandon his design. What say you to this, marshal?

MARSHAL (with a look of bewildered stupidity). I am at my wits' end!

PRESIDENT. That might have blown over. But my spies have just brought me notice that the grand cupbearer, von Bock, is on the point of offering himself as a suitor to her ladyship.

MARSHAL. You drive me distracted! Whom did you say? Von Bock?Don't you know that we are mortal enemies? And don't you know why?

PRESIDENT. The first word that I ever heard of it!

MARSHAL. My dear count! You shall hear-your hair will stand on end! You must remember the famous court ball-it is now just twenty years ago. It was the first time that English country-dances were introduced-you remember how the hot wax trickled from the great chandelier on Count Meerschaum's blue and silver domino. Surely, you cannot have forgotten that affair!

PRESIDENT. Who could forget so remarkable a circumstance!

MARSHAL. Well, then, in the heat of the dance Princess Amelia lost her garter. The whole ball, as you may imagine, was instantly thrown into confusion. Von Bock and myself-we were then fellow-pages-crept through the whole saloon in search of the garter. At length I discovered it. Von Bock perceives my good-fortune-rushes forward-tears it from my hands, and, just fancy-presents it to the princess, and so cheated me of the honor I had so fortunately earned. What do you think of that?

PRESIDENT. 'Twas most insolent!

MARSHAL. I thought I should have fainted upon the spot. A trick so malicious was beyond the powers of mortal endurance. At length I recovered myself; and, approaching the princess, said,-“Von Bock, 'tis true, was fortunate enough to present the garter to your highness; but he who first discovered that treasure finds his reward in silence, and is dumb!”

PRESIDENT. Bravo, marshal! Admirably said! Most admirable!

MARSHAL. And is dumb! But till the day of judgment will I remember his conduct-the mean, sneaking sycophant! And as if that were not aggravation enough, he actually, as we were struggling on the ground for the garter, rubbed all the powder from one side of my peruke with his sleeve, and ruined me for the rest of the evening.

PRESIDENT. This is the man who will marry Lady Milford, and consequently soon take the lead at court.

MARSHAL. You plunge a dagger in my heart! But why must he? Why should he marry her? Why he? Where is the necessity?

PRESIDENT. Because Ferdinand refuses her, and there is no other candidate.

MARSHAL. But is there no possible method of obtaining your son's consent? Let the measure be ever so extravagant or desperate-there is nothing to which I should not willingly consent in order to supplant the hated von Bock.

PRESIDENT. I know but one means of accomplishing this, and that rests entirely with you.

MARSHAL. With me? Name it, my dear count, name it!

PRESIDENT. You must set Ferdinand and his mistress against each other.

MARSHAL. Against each other? How do you mean?-And how would that be possible.

PRESIDENT. Everything is ours could we make him suspect the girl.

MARSHAL. Ah, of theft, you mean?

PRESIDENT. Pshaw!-He would never believe that! No, no-I mean that she is carrying on an intrigue with another.

MARSHAL. And this other, who is he to be?

PRESIDENT. Yourself!

MARSHAL. How? Must I be her lover? Is she of noble birth?

PRESIDENT. What signifies that? What an idea!-she is the daughter of a musician.

MARSHAL. A plebeian?-That will never do!

PRESIDENT. What will never do? Nonsense, man! Who in the name of wonder would think of asking a pair of rosy cheeks for their owner's pedigree?

MARSHAL. But consider, my dear count, a married man! And my reputation at court!

PRESIDENT. Oh! That's quite another thing! I beg a thousand pardons, marshal; I was not aware that a man of unblemished morals held a higher place in your estimation than a man of power!Let us break up our conference.

MARSHAL. Be not so hasty, count. I did not mean to say that.

PRESIDENT (coldly.) No-no! You are perfectly right. I, too, am weary of office. I shall throw up the game, tender my resignation to the duke, and congratulate von Bock on his accession to the premiership. This duchy is not all the world.

MARSHAL. And what am I to do? It is very fine for you to talk thus!You are a man of learning! But I-mon Dieu! What shall I be if his highness dismisses me?

PRESIDENT. A stale jest!-A thing out of fashion!

MARSHAL. I implore you, my dearest, my most valued friend.Abandon those thoughts. I will consent to everything!

PRESIDENT. Will you lend your name to an assignation to which this Louisa Miller shall invite you in writing?

MARSHAL. Well, in God's name let it be so!

PRESIDENT. And drop the letter where the major cannot fail to find it.

MARSHAL. For instance, on the parade, where I can let it fall as if accidentally in drawing out my handkerchief.

PRESIDENT. And when the baron questions you will you assume the character of a favored rival?

MARSHAL. Mort de ma vie! I'll teach him manners! I'll cure him of interfering in my amours!

PRESIDENT. Good! Now you speak in the right key. The letter shall be written immediately! Come in the evening to receive it, and we will talk over the part you are to play.

MARSHAL. I will be with you the instant I have paid sixteen visits of the very highest importance. Permit me, therefore, to take my leave without delay. (Going.)

PRESIDENT (rings). I reckon upon your discretion, marshal.

MARSHAL (calls back). Ah, mon Dieu! You know me!

[Exit MARSHAL.





SCENE III.


The PRESIDENT and WORM.





WORM. The music-master and his wife have been arrested without the least disturbance. Will your excellency read this letter?

PRESIDENT (having read it). Excellent! Excellent, my dear secretary!Poison like this would convert health itself into jaundiced leprosy.The marshal, too, has taken the bait. Now then away with my proposals to the father, and then lose no time-with the daughter.

[Exeunt on different sides.





SCENE IV.


Room in MILLER's House. LOUISA and FERDINAND.





LOUISA. Cease, I implore you! I expect no more days of happiness.All my hopes are levelled with the dust.

FERDINAND. All mine are exalted to heaven! My father's passions are roused! He will direct his whole artillery against us! He will force me to become an unnatural son. I will not answer for my filial duty. Rage and despair will wring from me the dark secret that my father is an assassin! The son will deliver the parent into the hands of the executioner. This is a moment of extreme danger, and extreme danger alone could prompt my love to take so daring a leap! Hear me, Louisa! A thought, vast and immeasurable as my love, has arisen in my soul-thou, Louisa, and I, and Love! Lies not a whole heaven within this circle? Or dost thou feel that there is still something wanting?

LOUISA. Oh! Cease! No more! I tremble to think what you would say.

FERDINAND. If we have no longer a claim upon the world, why should we seek its approbation? Why venture where nothing can be gained and all may be lost? Will thine eyes sparkle less brightly reflected by the Baltic waves than by the waters of the Rhine or the Elbe? Where Louise loves me there is my native land! Thy footsteps will make the wild and sandy desert far more attractive than the marble halls of my ancestors. Shall we miss the pomp of cities? Be we where we may, Louisa, a sun will rise and a sun will set- scenes before which the most glorious achievements of art grow pale and dim! Though we serve God no more in his consecrated churches, yet the night shall spread her solemn shadows round us; the changing moon shall hear our confession, and a glorious congregation of stars join in our prayers! Think you our talk of love can ever be exhausted! Oh, no! One smile from

Louisa were a theme for centuries-the dream of life will be over ere I can exhaust the charms of a single tear.

LOUISA. And hast thou no duty save that of love?

FERDINAND (embracing her). None so sacred as thy peace of mind!

LOUISA (very seriously). Cease, then, and leave me. I have a father who possesses no treasure save one only daughter. Tomorrow he will be sixty years old-that he will fall a victim to the vengeance of the President is most certain!

FERDINAND (interrupting her). He shall accompany us. Therefore no more objections, my beloved. I will go and convert my valuables into gold, and raise money on my father's credit! It is lawful to plunder a robber, and are not his treasures the price for which he has sold his country? This night, when the clock strikes one, a carriage will stop at your door-throw yourself into it, and we fly!

LOUISA. Pursued by your father's curse! A curse, unthinking one, which is never pronounced in vain even by murderers-which the avenging angel hears when uttered by a malefactor in his last agony-which, like a fury, will fearfully pursue the fugitives from shore to shore! No, my beloved! If naught but a crime can preserve you to me, I still have courage to resign you!

FERDINAND (mutters gloomily). Indeed!

LOUISA. Resign you? Oh! Horrible beyond all measure is the thought.Horrible enough to pierce the immortal spirit and pale the glowing cheeks of joy! Ferdinand! To resign you! Yet how can one resign what one never possessed? Your heart is the property of your station. My claim was sacrilege, and, shuddering, I withdraw it!

FERDINAND (with convulsed features, and biting his underlip). You withdraw it!

LOUISA. Nay! Look upon me, dearest Ferdinand. Gnash not your teeth so bitterly! Come, let my example rouse your slumbering courage.Let me be the heroine of this moment. Let me restore to a father his lost son. I will renounce a union which would sever the bonds by which society is held together, and overthrow the landmarks of social order. I am the criminal. My bosom has nourished proud and foolish wishes, and my present misery is a just punishment.Oh! Leave me then the sweet, the consoling idea that mine is the sacrifice. Canst thou deny me this last satisfaction? (FERDINAND, stupefied with agitation and anger, seizes a violin and strikes a few notes upon it; and then tears away the strings, dashes the instrument upon the ground, and, stamping it to pieces, bursts into a loud laugh.)Walter! God in Heaven! What mean you? Be not thus unmanned!This hour requires fortitude; it is the hour of separation! You have a heart, dear Walter; I know that heart-warm as life is your love-boundless and immeasurable-bestow it on one more noble, more worthy-she need not envy the most fortunate of her sex! (Striving to repress her tears.) You shall see me no more! Leave the vain disappointed girl to bewail her sorrow in sad and lonely seclusion;where her tears will flow unheeded. Dead and gone are all my hopes of happiness in this world; yet still shall I inhale ever and anon the perfumes of the faded wreath! (Giving him her trembling hand, while her face is turned away.) Baron Walter, farewell!

FERDINAND (recovering from the stupor in which he was plunged). Louisa, I fly! Do you indeed refuse to follow me?

LOUISA (who has retreated to the further end of the apartment, conceals her countenance with her hands). My duty bids me stay, and suffer.

FERDINAND. Serpent! Thou liest-some other motive chains thee here!

LOUISA (in a tone of the most heartfelt sorrow). Encourage that belief.Haply it may make our parting more supportable.

FERDINAND. What? Oppose freezing duty to fiery love! And dost thou think to cheat me with that delusion? Some rival detains thee here, and woe be to thee and him should my suspicions be confirmed!

[Exit.





SCENE V.


LOUISA (she remains for some time motionless in the seat upon which she has thrown herself. At length she rises, comes forward, and looks timidly around). Where can my parents be? My father promised to return in a few minutes; yet full five dreadful hours have passed since his departure. Should any accident——good Heavens! What is come over me? Why does my heart palpitate so violently?(Here WORM enters, and remains standing unobserved in the background.) It can be nothing real. 'Tis but the terrible delusion of my over-heated blood. When once the soul is wrapped in terror the eye behold spectres in every shadow.





SCENE VI.


LOUISA and WORM.





WORM (approaches her). Good evening, miss.

LOUISA. Heavens! Who speaks! (Perceives him, and starts back in terror.) Ha! Dreadful! Dreadful! I fear some dire misfortune is even now realizing the forebodings of my soul! (To WORM, with a look of disdain.) Do you seek the president? He is no longer here.

WORM. 'Tis you I seek, miss!

LOUISA. I wonder, then, that you did not direct your steps towards the market-place.

WORM. What should I do there?

LOUISA. Release your betrothed from the pillory.

WORM. Louisa, you cherish some false suspicion——

LOUISA (sharply interrupting him). What is your business with me?

WORM. I come with a message from your father.

LOUISA (agitated). From my father? Oh! Where is my father?

WORM. Where he would fain not be!

LOUISA. Quick, quick, for God's sake! Oh! My foreboding heart!Where is my father!

WORM. In prison, if you needs must know!

LOUISA (with a look towards heaven). This, too! This, too! In prison, said you? And why in prison?

WORM. It is the duke's order.

LOUISA. The duke's?

WORM. Who thinking his own dignity offended by the insults offered to the person of his representative——

LOUISA. How? How? Oh ye Almighty Powers!

WORM. ——Has resolved to inflict the most exemplary punishment.

LOUISA. This was still wanting! This! Yes, in truth. I now feel that my heart does love another besides Ferdinand! That could not be allowed to escape! The prince's dignity offended? Heavenly Providence! Save, oh! Save my sinking faith! (After a moment's pause, she turns to WORM.) And Ferdinand?

WORM. Must choose between Lady Milford's hand and his father's curse and disinheritance.

LOUISA. Terrible choice!-And yet-yet is he the happier of the two.He has no father to lose-and yet to have none is misery enough!My father imprisoned for treason-my Ferdinand compelled to choose between Lady Milford's hand or a parent's curse and disinheritance! Truly admirable! For even villany so perfect is perfection! Perfection? No! Something is still wanting to complete that. Where is my mother?

WORM. In the house of correction.

LOUISA (with a smile of despair). Now the measure is full! It is full, and I am free-released from all duties-all sorrows-all joys!Released even from Providence! I have nothing more to do with it!(A dreadful pause.) Have you aught else to communicate? Speak freely-now I can hear anything with indifference.

WORM. All that has happened you already know.

LOUISA. But not that which is yet to happen! (Another pause, during which she surveys WORM from head to foot.) Unfortunate man! You have entered on a melancholy employment, which can never lead you to happiness. To cause misery to others is sad enough-but to be the messenger of evil is horrible indeed-to be the first to shriek the screech-owl's song, to stand by when the bleeding heart trembles upon the iron shaft of necessity, and the Christian doubts the existence of a God-Heaven protect me! Wert thou paid a ton of gold for every tear of anguish which thou must witness, I would not be a wretch like thee! What is there yet to happen?

WORM. I know not.

LOUISA. You pretend not to know? This light-shunning embassy trembles at the sound of words, but the spectre betrays itself in your ghastly visage. What is there yet to happen? You said the duke will inflict upon him a most exemplary punishment. What call you exemplary?

WORM. Ask me no more.

LOUISA. Terrible man! Some hangman must have schooled thee! Else thou hast not so well learned to prolong the torture of thy victim before giving the finishing stroke to the agonized heart! Speak!What fate awaits my father? Death thou canst announce with a laughing sneer-what then must that be which thou dost hesitate to disclose? Speak out! Let me at once receive the overwhelming weight of thy tidings! What fate awaits my father?

WORM. A criminal process.

LOUISA. But what is that? I am an ignorant, innocent girl, and understand but little of your fearful terms of law. What mean you by a criminal process?

WORM. Judgment upon life or death.

LOUISA (firmly). Ah! I thank you.[Exit hastily by a side door.

WORM (alarmed). What means this? Should the simpleton perchance- confusion! Surely she will not-I must follow her.I am answerable for her life. (As he is going towards the door, LOUISA returns, wrapped in a cloak.)

LOUISA. Your pardon, Mr. Secretary, I must lock the door.

WORM. Whither in such haste?

LOUISA (passing him). To the duke.

WORM (alarmed, detains her). How? Whither?

LOUISA. To the duke. Do you not hear? Even to that very duke whose will is to decide upon my father's life or death. Yet no?-'Tis not his will that decides, but the will of wicked men who surround his throne. He lends naught to this process, save the shadow of his majesty, and his royal signature.

WORM (with a burst of laughter). To the duke!

LOUISA. I know the meaning of that sneering laugh-you would tell me that I shall find no compassion there. But though I may meet (God preserve me!) with nothing but scorn-scorn at my sorrows-yet will I to the duke. I have been told that the great never know what misery is; that they fly from the knowledge of it. But I will teach the duke what misery is; I will paint to him, in all the writhing agonies of death, what misery is; I will cry aloud in wailings that shall creep through the very marrow of his bones, what misery is; and, while at my picture his hairs shall stand on end like quills upon the porcupine, will I shriek into his affrighted ear, that in the hour of death the sinews of these mighty gods of earth shall shrivel and shrink, and that at the day of judgment beggars and kings shall be weighed together in the same balance(Going.)

WORM (ironically). By all means go to the duke! You can really do nothing more prudent; I advise you heartily to the step. Only go, and I give you my word that the duke will grant your suit.

LOUISA (stopping suddenly). What said you? Do you yourself advise the step? (Returns hastily). What am I about to do? Something wicked surely, since this man approves it-how know you that the prince will grant my suit?

WORM. Because he will not have to grant it unrewarded.

LOUISA. Not unrewarded? And what price does he set on his humanity?

WORM. The person of the fair suppliant will be payment enough!

LOUISA (stopping for a moment in mute dismay-in a feeble voice). Almighty God!

WORM. And I trust that you will not think your father's life over-valued when 'tis purchased at so gracious a price.

LOUISA (with great indignation). True, oh! True! The great are entrenched from truth behind their own vices, safely as behind the swords of cherubim. The Almighty protect thee, father! Your child can die-but not sin for thee.

WORM. This will be agreeable news for the poor disconsolate old man. “My Louisa,” Says he, “has bowed me down to the earth;but my Louisa will raise me up again.” I hasten to him with your answer. (Affects to be about to depart.)

LOUISA (flies after him and holds him back). Stay! Stay! One moment's patience! How nimble this Satan is, when his business is to drive humanity distracted! I have bowed him to the earth! I must raise him up again! Speak to me! Counsel me! What can I, what must I do?

WORM. There is but one means of saving him!

LOUISA. What is that means?

WORM. And your father approves of it——

LOUISA. My father? Oh! Name that means.

WORM. It is easy for you to execute.

LOUISA. I know of nothing harder than infamy!

WORM. Suppose you were to release the major from his engagement?

LOUISA. Release him! Do you mock me? Do you call that a choice to which force compelled me?

WORM. You mistake me, dear girl! The major must resign you willingly, and be the first to retract his engagement.

LOUISA. That he will never do.

WORM. So it appears. Should we, do you think, have had recourse to you were it not that you alone are able to help us?

LOUISA. I cannot compel him to hate me.

WORM. We will try! Be seated.

LOUISA (drawing back). Man! What is brooding in thy artful brain?

WORM. Be seated. Here are paper, pens, and ink. Write what I dictate.

LOUISA (sitting down in the greatest uneasiness). What must I write?To whom must I write?

WORM. To your father's executioner.

LOUISA. Ah! How well thou knowest to torture souls to thy purpose.(Takes a pen.)

WORM (dictating to her). “My dear Sir (LOUISA writes with a trembling hand.) three days, three insupportable days, have already passed-already passed-since last we met.”

LOUISA (starts, and lays down her pen). To whom is the letter?

WORM. To your father's executioner.

LOUISA. Oh! My God!

WORM. “But for this you must blame the major-the major-who watches me all day with the vigilance of an Argus.”

LOUISA (starting up). Villany! Villany beyond all precedent! To whom is the letter?

WORM. To your father's executioner.

LOUISA (paces to and fro, wringing her hands). No, no, no! This is tyrannical! Oh Heaven! If mortals provoke thee, punish them like mortals; but wherefore must I be placed between two precipices?Wherefore am I hurled by turns from death to infamy, from infamy to death? Wherefore is my neck made the footstool of this blood-sucking fiend? No; do what thou wilt, I will never write that!

WORM (seizing his hat). As you please, miss! It rests entirely on your own pleasure!

LOUISA. Pleasure, say'st thou? On my own pleasure? Go, barbarian!Suspend some unfortunate over the pit of hell; then make your demands, and ask your victim if it be his pleasure to grant your request! Oh! Thou knowest but too well that the bonds of nature bind our hearts as firmly as chains! But all is now alike indifferent.Dictate! I cease to think! Artifices of hell, I yield to ye! (She resumes her seat at the table.)

WORM. “With the vigilance of an Argus.” Have you written it?

LOUISA. Proceed, proceed!

WORM. “The president was here yesterday. It was amusing to see how warm the poor major was in defence of my honor.”

LOUISA. Excellent! Excellent! Oh! Admirable! Quick! Quick, go on!

WORM. “I had recourse to a swoon-a swoon-that I might not laugh aloud”——

LOUISA. Oh, Heavens!

WORM. “But the mask which I have worn so long is becoming insupportable-insupportable. Oh! if I could but rid myself of him.”

LOUISA (rises, and walks a few turns with her head bent down, as if she sought something upon the floor: then returns to her place, and continues to write). “Rid myself of him.”

WORM. “He will be on duty tomorrow-observe when he leaves me, and hasten to the usual place.” Have you written “the usual place”?

LOUISA. Everything, everything!

WORM. “To the usual place, to meet your devotedly attached Louisa.”

LOUISA. Now then, the address?

WORM. “To Marshal von Kalb.”

LOUISA. Eternal Providence! A name as foreign to my ear as these scandalous lines are to my heart! (She rises, and for some moments surveys the writing with a vacant gaze. At length she hands it to WORM, speaking in a voice trembling and exhausted.) Take it, Sir! What I now put into your hands is my good name. It is Ferdinand-it is the whole joy of my life! You have it, and now I am a beggar——

WORM. Oh! Not so! Despair not, dear girl! You inspire me with the most heartfelt pity! Perhaps-who knows? I might even now overlook certain parts of your conduct-yes! Heaven is my witness, how deeply I compassionate your sorrows!

LOUISA (giving him a piercing look). Do not explain yourself! You are on the point of asking something more terrible than all.

WORM (attempting to kiss her hand). What if I asked this little hand?Would that be terrible, Louisa?

LOUISA (with great indignation). Yes! For I should strangle you on the bridal night: and for such a deed I would joyfully yield my body to be torn on the rack! (She is going, but comes hurriedly back.) Is all settled between us, sir? May the dove be released?

WORM. A trifle yet remains, maiden! You must swear, by the holy sacrament, to acknowledge this letter for your free and voluntary act.

LOUISA. Oh God! Oh God! And wilt thou grant thine own seal to confirm the works of hell? (WORM leads her away.)





ACT IV.





SCENE I.


Saloon in the PRESIDENT's House.



FERDINAND VON WALTER enters in great excitement with an open letter in his hand, and is met by a SERVANT.





FERDINAND. Is the marshal here?

SERVANT. My lord, his highness the president is inquiring for you.

FERDINAND. Fire and fury! I ask is the marshal here?

SERVANT. His honor is engaged at the faro-table, above stairs.

FERDINAND. Tell his honor, in the name of all the devils in hell, to make his appearance this instant!

[Exit SERVANT.





SCENE II.


FERDINAND (hastily reading the letter, at one moment seeming petrified with astonishment, at the next pacing the room with fury).Impossible! Quite impossible! A form so heavenly cannot hide so devilish a heart. And yet!-And yet! Though all the angels of heaven should descend on earth and proclaim her innocence-though heaven and earth, the Creator and the created, should, with one accord, vouch for her innocence-it is her hand, her own hand!Treachery, monstrous, infernal treachery, such as humanity never before witnessed! This, then, was the reason she so resolutely opposed our flight! This it was-Oh, God! Now I awake from my dream! Now the veil is lifted! This, then, is why she surrendered with so much seeming heroism her claims on my affection, and all but cheated me with her saint-like demeanor! (He traverses the chamber rapidly, and then remains for some moments in deep thought.) To fathom my heart to its very core! To reciprocate every lofty sentiment, every gentle emotion, every fiery ebullition! To sympathize with every secret breathing of my soul! To study me even in her tears! To mount with me to the sublimest heights of passion-to brave with me, undaunted, each fearful precipice! God of heaven! And was all this deceit? Mere grimace? Oh, if falsehood can assume so lovely an appearance of truth why has no devil yet lied himself back into heaven?

When I unfolded to her the dangers which threatened our affection, with what convincing artifice did the false one turn pale! With what overpowering dignity did she repulse my father's licentious scoffs! Yet at that very moment the deceiver was conscious of her guilt! Nay, did she not even undergo the fiery ordeal of truth?Forsooth, the hypocrite fainted! What must now be thy language, sensibility, since coquettes faint? How wilt thou vindicate thyself, innocence?-for even strumpets faint?

She knows her power over me-she has seen through my very heart! My soul shone conspicuous in my eyes at the blush of her first kiss. And that she should have felt nothing! Or perhaps felt only the triumph of her art; whilst my happy delirium fancied that in her I embraced a whole heaven, my wildest wishes were hushed!No thought but of her and eternity was present to my mind. Oh, God! And yet she felt nothing? Nothing? But that her artifice had triumphed! That her charms were flattered! Death and vengeance!Nothing, but that I was betrayed!





SCENE III.


FERDINAND, the MARSHAL.





MARSHAL (tripping into the room). I am told, my dear baron, that you have expressed a wish——

FERDINAND (muttering to himself). To break your rascally neck.(Aloud.) Marshal, this letter must have dropped out of your pocket on parade. (With a malicious smile.) And I have been the fortunate finder.

MARSHAL. You?

FERDINAND. By a singular coincidence! Now, balance thy account with heaven!

MARSHAL. You quite alarm me, baron!

FERDINAND. Read it, sir, read it! (Turning from him.) If I am not good enough for a lover perhaps I may do for a pimp. (While the MARSHAL reads, FERDINAND goes to the wall and takes down the pistols.)

KALB (throws the letter upon the table, and rushes off). Confusion!

FERDINAND (leads him back by the arm). Wait a little, my dear marshal! The intelligence contained in that letter appears to be agreeable! The finder must have his reward. (Showing him the pistols.)

MARSHAL (starts back in alarm). Have you lost your senses, baron?

FERDINAND (in a terrible voice). I have more than enough left to rid the world of such a scoundrel as you! Choose one of these instantly! (He forces a pistol into the MARSHAL's hand, and then draws out his handkerchief.) And now take the other end of this handkerchief! It was given me by the strumpet herself!

MARSHAL. What, shoot over the handkerchief? Baron, are you mad? What can you be thinking of?

FERDINAND. Lay hold of it, I say! Or you will be sure to miss your aim, coward! How the coward trembles! You should thank God, you pitiful coward, that you have a chance for once of getting something in your empty brain-box. (The MARSHAL takes to his heels.) Gently, gently! I'll take care of that. (Overtakes him and bolts the door.)

MARSHAL. Surely you will not fight in the chamber?

FERDINAND. As if you were worth the trouble of a walk beyond the boundaries! The report, my dear fellow, will be louder, and, for the first time, you will make some noise in the world. Now, then, take hold!

MARSHAL (wiping his forehead). Yet consider, I entreat. Would you risk your precious life, young and promising as you are, in this desperate manner?

FERDINAND. Take hold, I say! I have nothing more to do in this world!

MARSHAL. But I have much, my dearest, most excellent friend!

FERDINAND. Thou, wretch-thou? What hast thou to do, but to play the stop-gap, where honest men keep aloof! To stretch or shrink seven times in an instant, like the butterfly on a pin? To be privy registrar in chief and clerk of the jordan? To be the cap-and-bell buffoon on which your master sharpens his wit? Well, well, let it be so. I will carry you about with me, as I would a marmot of rare training. You shall skip and dance, like a tamed monkey, to the howling of the damned; fetch, carry, and serve; and with your courtly arts enliven the wailings of everlasting despair!

MARSHAL. Anything you please, dear major! Whatever you please!Only take away the pistols!

FERDINAND. How he stands there, poor trembling wretch! There he stands, a blot on the sixth day of creation. He looks as if he were a piratical counterfeit of the Almighty original. Pity, eternal pity! that an atom of brains should lie wasting in so barren a skull!That single atom bestowed upon a baboon might have made him a perfect man, whereas it is now a mere useless fragment. And that she should share her heart with a thing like this! Monstrous!Incredible! A wretch more formed to wean from sin than to excite it!

MARSHAL. Praised be Heaven! He is getting witty.

FERDINAND. I will let him live! That toleration which spares the caterpillar shall be extended to him! Men shall look on him in wonder, and, shrugging their shoulders, admire the wise dispensation of Providence, which can feed its creatures with husks and scourings; which spreads the table for the raven on the gallows, and for the courtier in the slime of majesty. We wonder at the wisdom of Providence, which even in the world of spirits maintains its staff of venomous reptiles for the dissemination of poison. (Relapsing into rage.) But such vermin shall not pollute my rose; sooner will I crush it to atoms (seizing the MARSHAL and shaking him roughly), thus-and thus-and thus——

MARSHAL. Oh! God, that I were away from here! Hundreds of miles away in the asylum for maniacs at Paris! Anywhere but near this man!

FERDINAND. Villain! If she be no longer pure! Villain! If thou hast profaned where I worshipped! (with increased fury). If thou hast polluted, where I believed myself the god! (Pausing suddenly; then in a solemn terrible voice.) It were better for thee, villain, to flee to hell, than to encounter my wrath in heaven! Confess! To what extent has your unhallowed love proceeded?

MARSHAL. Let me go! I will confess everything.

FERDINAND. Oh! It must be more rapturous even to be her licentious paramour than to burn with the purest flame for any other! Would she surrender her charms to unlicensed pleasure she might dissolve the soul itself to sin, and make voluptuousness pass for virtue(pressing his pistol against the MARSHAL's breast). To what extremities have you proceeded? Confess this instant or I fire!

MARSHAL. There is nothing at all in it, I assure you! There is not a syllable of truth in the whole business! Have but a moment's patience! You are deceived, indeed you are!

FERDINAND (furiously). And dare you remind me of that, villain? To what extremities have you proceeded? Confess, or you are a dead man!

MARSHAL. Mon Dieu! My God! You mistake my words! Only listen for a moment. When a father——

FERDINAND (still more enraged). No doubt! He threw his daughter into your arms? And how far have you proceeded? Confess, or I will murder you!

MARSHAL. You rave! You will not listen! I never saw her! I don't know her! I know nothing at all about her!

FERDINAND (drawing back). You never saw her? You don't know her? Know nothing at all about her? Louisa is lost to me forever on thy account, and yet in one breath hast thou denied her thrice. Go, wretch, go (he gives him a blow with the pistol, and thrusts him out of the chamber); powder were thrown away on such a miscreant.

[Exit MARSHAL.





SCENE IV.


FERDINAND (after a long silence, during which his countenance declares him to be agitated by some dreadful idea). Forever lost? Yes, false unfortunate, both are lost! Ay, by the Almighty God! if I am lost, thou art so too. Judge of the world, ask her not from me! She is mine. For her sake I renounced the whole world-abandoned all thy glorious creation. Leave me the maid, great Judge of the world! Millions of souls pour out their plaints to thee-turn on them thine eye of compassion, but leave me, almighty Judge-leave me to myself. (Clasping his hands in agony.) Can the bountiful, the munificent Creator be covetous of one miserable soul, and that soul the worst of his creation? The maiden is mine! Once I was her god, but now I am her devil!

(Fixes his eyes with terrible expression.)

An eternity passed with her upon the rack of everlasting perdition!Her melting eye-balls riveted on mine! Our blazing locks entwined together! Our shrieks of agony dissolving into one! And then to renew to her my vows of love, and chant unceasingly her broken oaths! God! God! The union is dreadful-and eternal! (As he is about to rush off, the PRESIDENT meets him.)





SCENE V.


FERDINAND, the PRESIDENT.





FERDINAND (starting back). Ha! My father.

PRESIDENT. I am glad to meet with you, Ferdinand! I come to bring you some pleasant news-something that will certainly surprise you, my dear son. Shall we be seated?

FERDINAND (after gazing upon him for some time with a vacant stare).My father! (Going to him with emotion, and grasping his hand.) My father! (Kissing it, and falling at his feet.) Oh, father!

PRESIDENT. What is the matter? Rise, my son. Your hand burns and trembles!

FERDINAND (wildly). Forgive my ingratitude, father! I am a lost man! I have misinterpreted your kindness! Your meaning was so truly-truly paternal! Oh! You had a prophetic soul! Now it is too late! Pardon! Pardon! Your blessing, my dear father!

PRESIDENT (feigning astonishment). Arise, my son! Recollect that your words to me are riddles!

FERDINAND. This Louisa, dear father! Oh! You understand mankind!Your anger was so just, so noble, so truly the zeal of a father! Had not its very earnestness led you to mistake the way. This Louisa!

PRESIDENT. Spare me, dear boy! Curses on my severity! Come to entreat your forgiveness——

FERDINAND. Forgiveness from me! Curse me rather. Your disapproval was wisdom! Your severity was heavenly mercy! This Louisa, father——

PRESIDENT. Is a noble, a lovely girl! I recall my too rash suspicions!She has won my entire esteem!

FERDINAND (starting up). What? You, too? Father, even you? And is she not, father, the very personification of innocence? And is it not so natural to love this maiden?

PRESIDENT. Say, rather, 'twere a crime not to love her.

FERDINAND. Incredible! Wonderful! And you, too, who can so thoroughly see through the heart! And you, who saw her faults with the eyes of hatred! Oh, unexampled hypocrisy! This Louisa, father!

PRESIDENT. Is worthy to be my daughter! Her virtues supply the want of ancestry, her beauty the want of fortune. My prudential maxims yield to the force of your attachment. Louisa shall be yours!

FERDINAND. Naught but this wanting! Father, farewell! (Rushes out of the apartment.)

PRESIDENT (following him). Stay, my son, stay! Whither do you fly?





SCENE VI.


A magnificent Saloon in LADY MILFORD's House.



Enter LADY MILFORD and SOPHIA.





LADY MILFORD. You have seen her then? Will she come?

SOPHIA. Yes, in a moment! She was in dishabille, and only requested time to change her dress.

LADY MILFORD. Speak not of her. Silence! I tremble like a criminal at the prospect of beholding that fortunate woman whose heart sympathizes thus cruelly with my own. And how did she receive my invitation?

SOPHIA. She seemed surprised, became thoughtful, fixed her eyes on me steadfastly, and for a while remained silent. I was already prepared for her excuses, when she returned me this answer with a look that quite astonished me; “tell your mistress that she commands what I myself intended to request tomorrow.”

LADY MILFORD. Leave me, Sophia! Pity me! I must blush if she is but an ordinary woman-despair if she is more!

SOPHIA. But, my lady! It is not in this spirit that a rival should be received! Remember who you are! Summon to your aid your birth, your rank, your power! A prouder soul should heighten the gorgeous splendor of your appearance.

LADY MILFORD (in a fit of absence). What is the simpleton babbling about?

SOPHIA (maliciously). Or, is it, perhaps, by chance that today, in particular, you are adorned with your most costly brilliants? By chance that you are today arrayed in your most sumptuous robes?That your antechamber is crowded with guards and pages; and that the tradesman's daughter is to be received in the most stately apartment of the palace?

LADY MILFORD (angry and nettled). This is outrageous! Insupportable!Oh that woman should have such argus-eyes for woman's weakness!How low, how irretrievably low must I have fallen when such a creature has power to fathom me!

LADY MILFORD, SOPHIA, a SERVANT.



SERVANT (entering). Ma'mselle Miller waits.

LADY MILFORD (to SOPHIA). Hence with you! Leave the room instantly! (Imperiously, as the latter hesitates.) Must I repeat my orders? (SOPHIA retires-LADY MILFORD takes a few turns hastily.) So; 'tis well that I have been excited! I am in the fitter mood for this meeting. (To the SERVANT.) Let her approach.

[Exit SERVANT. LADY MILFORD throws herself upon the sofa, and assumes a negligent but studied attitude.





SCENE VII.


LADY MILFORD, LOUISA.



LOUISA enters timidly, and remains standing at a great distance from LADY MILFORD, who has turned her back towards her, and for some time watches her attentively in the opposite looking-glass. After a pause ——





LOUISA. Noble lady, I await your commands.

LADY MILFORD (turning towards LOUISA, and making a slight and distant motion with her head.) Oh! Are you there? I presume the young lady-a certain—— Pray what is your name?

LOUISA (somewhat sensitively). My father's name is Miller. Your ladyship expressed a wish to see his daughter.

LADY MILFORD. True, true! I remember. The poor musician's daughter, of whom we were speaking the other day. (Aside, after a pause.) Very interesting, but no beauty! (To LOUISA.) Come nearer, my child. (Again aside.) Eyes well practised in weeping. Oh! How I love those eyes! (Aloud.) Nearer-come nearer! Quite close! I really think, my good child, that you are afraid of me!

LOUISA (with firmness and dignity). No, my lady-I despise the opinion of the multitude!

LADY MILFORD (aside). Well, to be sure! She has learnt this boldness from him. (To LOUISA.) You have been recommended to me, miss! I am told that you have been decently educated, and are well disposed. I can readily believe it; besides, I would not, for the world, doubt the word of so warm an advocate.

LOUISA. And yet I remember no one, my lady, who would be at the trouble to seek your ladyship's patronage for me!

LADY MILFORD (significantly). Does that imply my unworthiness, or your humility?

LOUISA. Your words are beyond my comprehension, lady.

LADY MILFORD. More cunning than I should have expected from that open countenance. (To LOUISA.) Your name is Louisa, I believe? May I inquire your age?

LOUISA. Sixteen, just turned.

LADY MILFORD (starting up). Ha! There it is! Sixteen! The first pulsation of love! The first sweet vibration upon the yet unsounded harp! Nothing is more fascinating. (To LOUISA.) Be seated, lovely girl-I am anxious about you. (To herself.) And he, too, loves for the first time! What wonder, if the ruddy morning beams should meet and blend? (To LOUISA, taking her hand affectionately.) 'Tis settled: I will make your fortune. (To herself.) Oh! There is nothing in it: nothing, but the sweet transient vision of youth! (To LOUISA, patting her on the cheek.) My Sophy is on the point of leaving me to be married: you shall have her place. But just sixteen? Oh! It can never last.

LOUISA (kissing her hand respectfully). Receive my thanks, lady, for your intended favors, and believe me not the less grateful though I may decline to accept them.

LADY MILFORD (relapsing into disdain and anger). Only hear the great lady! Girls of your station generally think themselves fortunate to obtain such promotion. What is your dependence, my dainty one? Are these fingers too delicate for work?-Or is it your pretty baby-face that makes you give yourself these airs?

LOUISA. My face, lady, is as little of my own choice as my station!

LADY MILFORD. Perhaps you believe that your beauty will last forever? Poor creature! Whoever put that into your head-be he who he may-has deceived both you and himself! The colors of those cheeks are not burnt in with fire: what your mirror passes off upon you as solid and enduring is but a slight tinselling, which, sooner or later, will rub off in the hands of the purchaser. What then, will you do?

LOUISA. Pity the purchaser, lady, who bought a diamond because it appeared to be set in gold.

LADY MILFORD (affecting not to hear her). A damsel of your age has ever two mirrors, the real one, and her admirer. The flattering complaisance of the latter counterbalances the rough honesty of the former. What the one proclaims frightful pock-marks, the other declares to be dimples that would adorn the Graces. The credulous maid believes only so much of the former as is confirmed by the latter, and hies from one to the other till she confounds their testimonies, and concludes by fancying them to be both of one opinion. Why do you stare at me so?

LOUISA. Pardon me, lady! I was just then pitying those gorgeous sparkling brilliants, which are unconscious that their possessor is so strenuous a foe to vanity.

LADY MILFORD (reddening). No evasion, miss. Were it not that you depend upon personal attractions, what in the world could induce you to reject a situation, the only one where you can acquire polish of manners and divest yourself of your plebeian prejudices?

LOUISA. And with them, I presume, my plebeian innocence!

LADY MILFORD. Preposterous objection! The most dissolute libertine dares not to disrespect our sex, unless we ourselves encourage him by advances. Prove what you are; make manifest your virtue and honor, and I will guarantee your innocence from danger.

LOUISA. Of that, lady, permit me to entertain a doubt! The palaces of certain ladies are but too often made a theatre for the most unbridled licentiousness. Who will believe that a poor musician's daughter could have the heroism to plunge into the midst of contagion and yet preserve herself untainted? Who will believe that Lady Milford would perpetually hold a scorpion to her breast, and lavish her wealth to purchase the advantage of every moment feeling her cheeks dyed with the crimson blush of shame? I will be frank, lady!-While I adorned you for some assignation, could you meet my eye unabashed? Could you endure my glance when you returned? Oh! Better, far better, would it be that oceans should roll between us-that we should inhabit different climes! Beware, my lady!-hours of temperance, moments of satiety might intrude; the gnawing worm of remorse might plant its sting in your bosom, and then what a torment would it be for you to read in the countenance of your handmaid that calm serenity with which virtue ever rewards an uncorrupted heart! (Retiring a few steps.) Once more, gracious lady, I entreat your pardon!

LADY MILFORD (extremely agitated). Insupportable, that she should tell me this! Still more insupportable, that what she tells is true!(Turning to LOUISA, and looking at her steadfastly.) Girl! Girl!This artifice does not blind me. Mere opinions do not speak out so warmly. Beneath the cloak of these sentiments lurks some far dearer interest. 'Tis that which makes my service particularly distasteful-which gives such energy to your language. (In a threatening voice.) What it is I am determined to discover.

LOUISA (with calm dignity). And what if you do discover it? Suppose the contemptuous trampling of your foot should rouse the injured worm, which its Creator has furnished with a sting to protect it against misusage. I fear not your vengeance, lady! The poor criminal extended on the rack can look unappalled even on the dissolution of the world. My misery is so exquisite that even sincerity cannot draw down upon me any further infliction! (After a pause.) You say that you would raise me from the obscurity of my station. I will not examine the motives of this suspicious favor.I will only ask, what could induce you to think me so foolish as to blush at my station? What could induce you to become the architect of my happiness, before you knew whether I was willing to receive that happiness at your hands? I had forever renounced all claims upon the pleasures of the world. I had forgiven fortune that she had dealt with me so niggardly. Ah! Why do you remind me of all this. If the Almighty himself hides his glory from the eyes of his creatures, lest the highest seraph should be overwhelmed by a sense of his own insignificance, why should mortals be so cruelly compassionate? Lady, lady! Why is your vaunted happiness so anxious to excite the envy and wonder of the wretched? Does your bliss stand in need of the exhibition of despair for entertainment?Oh! Rather grant me that blindness which alone can reconcile me to my barbarous lot! The insect feels itself as happy in a drop of water as though that drop was a paradise: so happy, and so contented! till some one tells it of a world of water, where navies ride and whales disport themselves! But you wish to make me happy, say you? (After a pause, she advances towards LADY MILFORD, and asks her suddenly.) Are you happy, lady? (LADY MILFORD turns from her hastily, and overpowered. LOUISA follows her, and lays her hand upon her bosom.) Does this heart wear the smile of its station? Could we now exchange breast for breast, and fate for fate-were I, in childlike innocence, to ask you on your conscience-were I to ask you as a mother- would you really counsel me to make the exchange?

LADY MILFORD (greatly excited, throwing herself on the sofa).Intolerable! Incomprehensible! No, Louisa, no! This greatness of thought is not your own, and your conceptions are too fiery, too full of youth, to be inspired by your father. Deceive me not! I detect another teacher——

LOUISA (looking piercingly at her). I cannot but wonder, my lady, that you should have only just discovered that other teacher, and yet have previously shown so much anxiety to patronize me!

LADY MILFORD (starting up). 'Tis not to be borne! Well, then, since I cannot escape you, I know him-know everything-know more than I wish to know! (Suddenly restraining herself, then continuing with a violence which by degrees increases to frenzy.) But dare, unhappy one!-Dare but still to love, or be beloved by him! What did I say? Dare but to think of him, or to be one of his thoughts! I am powerful, unhappy one!- Dreadful in my vengeance! As sure as there is a God in heaven thou art lost forever!

LOUISA (undaunted). Past all redemption, my lady, the moment you succeed in compelling him to love you!

LADY MILFORD. I understand you-but I care not for his love! I will conquer this disgraceful passion. I will torture my own heart; but thine will I crush to atoms! Rocks and chasms will I hurl between you. I will rush, like a fury, into the heaven of your joys. My name shall affright your loves as a spectre scares an assassin. That young and blooming form in his embrace shall wither to a skeleton. I cannot be blest with him- neither shalt thou. Know, wretched girl;that to blast the happiness of others is in itself a happiness!

LOUISA. A happiness, my lady, which is already beyond your reach!Seek not to deceive your own heart! You are incapable of executing what you threaten! You are incapable of torturing a being who has done you no wrong-but whose misfortune it is that her feelings have been sensible to impressions like your own. But I love you for these transports, my lady!

LADY MILFORD (recovering herself). Where am I? What have I done? What sentiments have I betrayed? To whom have I betrayed them? Oh, Louisa, noble, great, divine soul, forgive the ravings of a maniac! Fear not, my child! I will not injure a hair of thy head!Name thy wishes! Ask what thou wilt! I will serve thee with all my power; I will be thy friend- thy sister! Thou art poor; look (taking off her brilliants), I will sell these jewels-sell my wardrobe-my carriages and horses-all shall be thine-grant me but Ferdinand!

LOUISA (draws back indignantly). Does she mock my despair?-Or is she really innocent of participation in that cruel deed? Ha!Then I may yet assume the heroine, and make my surrender of him pass for a sacrifice! (Remains for a while absorbed in thought, then approaches LADY MILFORD, seizes her hand, and gazes on her with a fixed and significant look.) Take him, lady! I here voluntarily resign the man whom hellish arts have torn from my bleeding bosom! Perchance you know it not, my lady! but you have destroyed the paradise of two lovers; you have torn asunder two hearts which God had linked together; you have crushed a creature not less dear to him than yourself, and no less created for happiness; one by whom he was worshipped as sincerely as by you;but who, henceforth, will worship him no more. But the Almighty is ever open to receive the last groan of the trampled worm. He will not look on with indifference when creatures in his keeping are murdered. Now Ferdinand is yours. Take him, lady, take him! Rush into his arms! Drag him with you to the altar! But forget not that the spectre of a suicide will rush between you and the bridal kiss. God be merciful! No choice is left me! (Rushes out of the chamber.)





SCENE VIII.


LADY MILFORD alone, in extreme agitation, gazing on the door by which LOUISA left. At length she recovers from her stupor.





LADY MILFORD. What was that? What preys so on my heart? What said the unhappy one? Still, O heaven, the dreadful, damning words ring in my ears! “Take him! Take him!” What should I take, unfortunate? The bequest of your dying groan-the fearful legacy of your despair? Gracious heaven! Am I then fallen so low? Am I so suddenly hurled from the towering throne of my pride that I greedily await what a beggar's generosity may throw me in the last struggle of death? “Take him! Take him!” And with what a tone was it uttered!-With what a look! What! Amelia! Is it for this thou hast overleaped the bounds of thy sex? For this didst thou vaunt the glorious title of a free-born Briton, that thy boasted edifice of honor might sink before the nobler soul of a despised and lowly maiden? No, proud unfortunate! No! Amelia Milford may blush for shame-but shall never be despised. I, too, have courage to resign. (She walks a few paces with a majestic gait.) Hide thyself, weak, suffering woman! Hence, ye sweet and golden dreams of love! Magnanimity alone be now my guide. These lovers are lost, or Amelia must withdraw her claim, and renounce the prince's heart. (After a pause, with animation.) It is determined! The dreadful obstacle is removed-broken are the bonds which bound me to the duke-torn from my bosom this raging passion. Virtue, into thy arms I throw myself. Receive thy repentant daughter.Ha! How happy do I feel! How suddenly relieved my heart, and how exalted! Glorious as the setting sun, will I this day descend from the pinnacle of my greatness; my grandeur shall expire with my love, and my own heart be the only sharer of my proud exile!(Going to her writing-table with a determined air.) It must be done at once-now, on the spot-before the recollection of Ferdinand renews the cruel conflict in my bosom! (She seats herself, and begins to write).





SCENE IX.


LADY MILFORD, an ATTENDANT, SOPHIA, afterwards the MARSHAL, and then SERVANTS.





SERVANT. Marshal von Kalb is in the ante-chamber, and brings a message from his highness.

LADY MILFORD (not hearing him in the eagerness of writing). How the illustrious puppet will stare! The idea is singular enough, I own, the presuming to astonish his serene numskull. In what confusion will his court be thrown! The whole country will be in a ferment.

SERVANT and SOPHIA. Marshal von Kalb, my lady!

LADY MILFORD (turning round). Who? The marshal? So much the better! Such creatures were designed by nature to carry the ass'panniers.

[Exit SERVANT.



SOPHIA (approaching anxiously). If I were not fearful, my lady, that you would think it presumption. (LADY MILFORD continuing to write eagerly.) Louisa Miller rushed madly to the hall-you are agitated-you speak to yourself. (LADY MILFORD continues writing.) I am quite alarmed. What can have happened? (The MARSHAL enters, making repeated bows at LADY MILFORD's back; as she takes no notice of him, he comes nearer, stands behind her chair, touches the hem of her dress, and imprints a kiss on it, saying in a tremulous voice.) His serene highness——

LADY MILFORD (while she peruses hastily what she has written). He will tax me with black ingratitude! “I was poor and forsaken! He raised me from misery! From misery.” Detestable exchange! Annul my bond, seducer! The blush of my eternal shame repays my debt with interest.

MARSHAL (after endeavoring in vain to catch her eye). Your ladyship seems somewhat absent. I take the liberty of permitting myself the boldness (very loud)-his serene highness, my lady, has sent me to inquire whether you mean to honor this evening's gala with your presence, or the theatre?

LADY MILFORD (rising, with a laugh). One or the other, sweet sir.In the meantime take this paper to your duke for his dessert. (To SOPHIA.) Do you, Sophia, give directions to have my carriage brought to the door without delay, and call my whole household together in this saloon.

SOPHIA (goes out in great astonishment). Heavens! What do I forebode? What will this end in?

MARSHAL. You seem excited, my lady!

LADY MILFORD. The greater the chance of my letting you into a little truth. Rejoice, my Lord Marshal! There is a place vacant at court. A fine time for panders. (As the MARSHAL throws a look of suspicion upon the paper.) Read it, read it! 'Tis my desire that the contents should be made public. (While he reads it, the domestics enter, and range themselves in the background.)

MARSHAL (reading). “Your highness-an engagement, broken by you so lightly, can no longer be binding on me. The happiness of your subjects was the condition of my love. For three years the deception has lasted. The veil at length falls from my eyes! I look with disgust on favors which are stained with the tears of your subjects. Bestow the love which I can no longer accept upon your weeping country, and learn from a British princess compassion to your German people. Within an hour I shall have quitted your dominions. JOANNA NORFOLK”

SERVANTS (exclaiming to each other in astonishment). Quitted the dominions!

MARSHAL (replaces the letter upon the table in terror). God forbid, my dear and most excellent lady! The bearer of such a letter would be as mad as the writer!

LADY MILFORD. That is your concern, you pink of a courtier! Alas!I am sorry to know that you, and such as you, would choke even in the utterance of what others dare to do. My advice is that you bake the letter in a venison pasty, so that his most serene highness may find it on his plate!

MARSHAL. God preserve me! What presumption! Ponder well, I entreat you. Reflect on the disgrace which you will bring down upon yourself, my lady!

LADY MILFORD (turning to the assembled domestics, and addressing them in the deepest emotion). You seem amazed, good people; and anxiously awaiting the solution of this riddle? Draw nearer, my friends! You have served me truly and affectionately; have looked into my eyes rather than my purse. My pleasure was your study, my approbation your pride! Woe is me, that the remembrance of your fidelity must be the record of my unworthiness! Unhappy fate, that the darkest season of my life should have been the brightest of yours! (Her eyes suffused with tears.) We must part, my children.Lady Milford has ceased to exist, and Joanna of Norfolk is too poor to repay your love. What little wealth I have my treasurer will share among you. This palace belongs to the duke. The poorest of you will quit it far richer than his mistress! Farewell, my children!(She extends her hand, which they all in turn kiss, with marks of sorrow and affection.) I understand you, my good people! Farewell!Forever farewell! (Struggling with her feelings.) I hear the carriage at the door. (She tears herself away, and is hurrying out when the MARSHAL arrests her progress.) How, now? Pitiful creature, art thou still there?

MARSHAL (who all this while has been gazing in vacant astonishment at the letter). And must I be the person to put this letter into the most august hands of his most serene highness?

LADY MILFORD. Pitiful creature, even thou! Thou must deliver into his most august hands, and convey to his most august ears, that, as I cannot go barefoot to Loretto, I will support myself by the labor of my hands, that I may be purified from the disgrace of having condescended to rule him. (She hurries off-the rest silently disperse.)





ACT V.





SCENE I.


Twilight; a room in MILLER's house.



LOUISA sits silent and motionless in a dark corner of the room, her head reclining upon her hand. After a long pause, MILLER enters with a lantern, the light of which he casts anxiously round the chamber, without observing LOUISA, he then puts his hat on the table, and sets down the lantern.



LOUISA, MILLER.





MILLER. She is not here either. No, she is not here! I have wandered through every street; I have sought her with every acquaintance; I have inquired at every door! No one has seen my child! (A silence of some moments.) Patience, poor unhappy father! Patience till morning; then perhaps the corpse of your only one may come floating to shore. Oh, God in heaven! What though my heart has hung too idolatrously upon this daughter, yet surely the punishment is severe! Heavenly Father! Surely it is severe! I will not murmur, Heavenly Father; but the punishment is indeed severe! (Throws himself sorrowfully into a chair.)

LOUISA (without moving from her seat). Thou dost well, wretched old man! Learn betimes to lose.

MILLER (starts up eagerly). Ah! Art thou there, my child? Art thou there? But wherefore thus alone, and without a light?

LOUISA. Yet am I not alone. When all things around me are dark and gloomy then have I the companionship which most I love.

MILLER. God defend thee, my child! The worm of conscience alone wakes and watches with the owl; none shun the light but criminals and evil spirits.

LOUISA. And eternity, father, which speaks to the soul in solitude!

MILLER. Louisa, my child! What words are these?

LOUISA (rises, and comes forward). I have fought a hard fight-you know it, father! But God gave me the strength! The fight is over!Father, our sex is called timid and weak; believe it no more! We tremble at a spider, but the black monster, corruption, we hug to our arms in sport! This for your edification, father. Your Louisa is merry.

MILLER. I had rather you wept. It would, please me better.

LOUISA. How I will outwit him, father! How I shall cheat the tyrant!Love is more crafty than malice, and bolder-he knew not that, the man of the unlucky star! Oh! They are cunning so long as they have but to do with the head; but when they have to grapple with the heart the villains are at fault. He thought to seal his treachery with an oath! Oaths, father, may bind the living, but death dissolves even the iron bonds of the sacrament! Ferdinand will learn to know his Louisa. Father, will you deliver this letter for me? Will you do me the kindness?

MILLER. To whom, my child?

LOUISA. Strange question! Infinitude and my heart together had not space enough for a single thought but of him. To whom else should I write?

MILLER (anxiously). Hear me, Louisa! I must read this letter!

LOUISA. As you please, father! But you will not understand it. The characters lie there like inanimate corpses, and live but for the eye of love.

MILLER (reading). “You are betrayed, Ferdinand! An unparalleled piece of villany has dissolved the union of our hearts; but a dreadful vow binds my tongue, and your father has spies stationed upon every side. But, if thou hast courage, my beloved, I know a place where oaths no longer bind, and where spies cannot enter.”(MILLER stops short, and gazes upon her steadfastly.)

LOUISA. Why that earnest look, father? Read what follows.

MILLER. “But thou must be fearless enough to wander through a gloomy path with no other guides than God and thy Louisa. Thou must have no companion but love; leave behind all thy hopes, all thy tumultuous wishes-thou wilt need nothing on this journey but thy heart. Darest thou come; then set out as the bell tolls twelve from the Carmelite Tower. Dost thou fear; then erase from the vocabulary of thy sex's virtues the word courage, for a maiden will have put thee to shame.” (MILLER lays down the letter and fixes his eyes upon the ground in deep sorrow. At length he turns to LOUISA, and says, in a low, broken voice) Daughter, where is that place?

LOUISA. Don't you know it, father? Do you really not know it? 'Tis strange! I have described it unmistakably! Ferdinand will not fail to find it.

MILLER. Pray speak plainer!

LOUISA. I can think of no pleasing name for it just now! You must not be alarmed, father, if the name I give it has a terrible sound. That place——Oh! Why has no lover invented a name for it! He would have chosen the softest, the sweetest-that place, my dear father-but you must not interrupt me-that place is-the grave!

MILLER (staggering to a seat). Oh, God!

LOUISA (hastens to him, and supports him). Nay, father, be not alarmed! These are but terrors which hover round an empty word!Take away the name and the grave will seem to be a bridal-bed over which Aurora spreads her golden canopy and spring strews her fairest flowers. None but a groaning sinner pictures death as a skeleton; to others he is a gentle, smiling boy, blooming as the god of love, but not so false-a silent, ministering spirit who guides the exhausted pilgrim through the desert of eternity, unlocks for him the fairy palace of everlasting joy, invites him in with friendly smiles, and vanishes forever!

MILLER. What meanest thou, my child? Surely, thou wilt not lay guilty hands on thine own life?

LOUISA. Speak not thus, father! To quit a community from which I am already rejected, to fly voluntarily to a place from which I cannot much longer be absent, is that a sin?

MILLER. Suicide is the most horrible of sins, my child. 'Tis the only one that can never he repented, since death arrives at the moment the crime is committed.

LOUISA (stands motionless with horror). That is dreadful! But my death will not be so sudden, father. I will spring into the river, and while the waters are closing over me, cry to the Almighty for mercy and forgiveness!

MILLER. That is to say, you will repent the theft as soon as the treasure is secure! Daughter! Daughter! Beware how you mock your God when you most need his help! Oh! You have gone far, far astray! You have forgotten the worship of your Creator, and he has withdrawn his protecting hand from you!LOUISA. Is it, then, a crime to love, father?

MILLER. So long as thou lovest God thou wilt never love man to idolatry. Thou hast bowed me down low, my only one! Low! Very low! Perhaps to the grave! Yet will I not increase the sadness of thy heart. Daughter! I gave vent to my feelings as I entered. I thought myself alone! Thou hast overheard me! And why should I longer conceal the truth. Thou wert my idol! Hear me, Louisa, if there is yet room in thy heart for a father's feelings. Thou wert my all!Of thine own thou hast nothing more to lose, but I have my all at stake! My life depends on thee! My hairs are turning gray, Louisa;they show that the time is drawing nigh with me when fathers look for a return of the capital invested in the hearts of their children.Wilt thou defraud me of this, Louisa? Wilt thou away and bear with thee all the wealth of thy father?

LOUISA (kissing his hand in the deepest emotion). No, father, no! I go from this world deeply in your debt, and will repay you with usury in the world to come.

MILLER. Beware, my child, lest thy reckoning should be false! (very earnestly and solemnly). Art thou certain that we shall meet in that world to come? Lo! How the color fades from thy cheek! My child must feel that I can scarcely overtake her in that other world if she hurries there before me. (LOUISA throws herself shuddering into his arms, he clasps her warmly to his bosom, and continues in a tone of fervent adjuration.) Oh! Louisa! Louisa! Fallen, perhaps already lost, daughter! Treasure in thy heart the solemn counsels of a father! I cannot eternally watch over thee! I may snatch the dagger from thy hands; but thou canst let out life with a bodkin. I may remove poison from thy reach; but thou canst strangle thyself with a necklace. Louisa! Louisa! I can only warn thee. Wilt thou rush boldly forward till the perfidious phantom which lured thee on vanishes at the awful brink of eternity? Wilt thou dare approach the throne of the Omniscient with the lie on thy lips? “At thy call am I here, Creator!” While thy guilty eyes are in search only of their mortal idol! And when thou shalt see this perishable god of thine own creation, a worm like thee, writhing at the Almighty's feet; when thou shalt hear him in the awful moment give the lie to thy guilty daring, and blast thy delusive hopes of eternal mercy, which the wretch implores in vain for himself; what then! (Louder and more fervently.) What, then, unhappy one? (He clasps her still closer to his bosom, and gazes upon her with wild and piercing looks; then suddenly disengages himself.) I can do no more! (Raising his right hand towards heaven.) Immortal Judge, I can do no more to save this soul from ruin! Louisa, do what thou wilt. Offer up a sacrifice at the altar of this idolized youth that shall make thy evil genius howl for transport and thy good angels forsake thee in despair. Go on! Heap sin upon sin-add to them this, the last, the heaviest-and, if the scale be still too light throw in my curse to complete the measure. Here is a knife; pierce thy own heart, and(weeping aloud and rushing away), and with it, thy father's!

LOUISA (following and detaining him). Stay! Stay! Oh! Father, father!-To think that affection should wound more cruelly than a tyrant's rage! What shall I?-I cannot!-What must I do?

MILLER. If thy lover's kisses burn hotter than thy father's tears-then die!

LOUISA (after a violent internal struggle, firmly). Father! Here is my hand! I will-God! God! What am I doing! What would I?-Father, I swear. Woe is me! Criminal that I am where'er I turn! Father, be it so! Ferdinand. God, look down upon the act! Thus I destroy the last memorial of him. (Tearing the letter.)

MILLER (throwing himself in ecstasy upon her neck). There spoke my daughter! Look up, my child! Thou hast lost a lover, but thou hast made a father happy. (Embracing her, and alternately laughing and crying.) My child! My child! I was not worthy to live so blest a moment! God knows how I, poor miserable sinner, became possessed of such an angel! My Louisa! My paradise! Oh! I know but little of love; but that to rend its bonds must be a bitter grief I can well believe!

LOUISA. But let us hasten from this place, my father! Let us fly from the city, where my companions scoff at me, and my good name is lost forever-let us away, far away, from a spot where every object tells of my ruined happiness-let us fly if it be possible!

MILLER. Whither thou wilt, my daughter! The bread of the Lord grows everywhere, and he will grant ears to listen to my music.Yes! We will fly and leave all behind. I will set the story of your sorrows to the lute, and sing of the daughter who rent her own heart to preserve her father's. We will beg with the ballad from door to door, and sweet will be the alms bestowed by the hand of weeping sympathy!





SCENE II.


The former; FERDINAND.





LOUISA (who perceives him first, throws herself shrieking into MILLER's arms). God! There he is! I am lost!

MILLER. Who? Where?

LOUISA (points, with averted face, to the MAJOR, and presses closer to her father). 'Tis he! 'Tis he! Himself! Look round, father, look round!-He comes to murder me!

MILLER (perceives him and starts back). How, baron? You here?

FERDINAND (approaches slowly, stands opposite to LOUISA, and fixes a stern and piercing look upon her. After a pause, he says). Stricken conscience, I thank thee! Thy confession is dreadful, but swift and true, and spares me the torment of an explanation! Good evening, Miller!

MILLER. For God's sake! Baron, what seek you? What brings you hither? What means this surprise?

FERDINAND. I knew a time when the day was divided into seconds, when eagerness for my presence hung upon the weights of the tardy clock, and when every pulse-throb was counted until the moment of my coming. How is it that I now surprise?

MILLER. Oh, leave us, leave us, baron! If but one spark of humanity still linger in your bosom; -if you seek not utterly to destroy her whom you profess to love, fly from this house, stay not one moment longer. The blessing of God deserted us when your foot first crossed its threshold. You have brought misery under a roof where all before was joy and happiness. Are you not yet content?Do you seek to deepen the wound which your fatal passion has planted in the heart of my only child?

FERDINAND. Strange father, I have come to bring joyful tidings to your daughter.

MILLER. Perchance fresh hopes, to add to her despair. Away, away, thou messenger of ill! Thy looks belie thy words.

FERDINAND. At length the goal of my hopes appears in view! Lady Milford, the most fearful obstacle to our love, has this moment fled the land. My father sanctions my choice. Fate grows weary of persecuting us, and our propitious stars now blaze in the ascendant-I am come to fulfil my plighted troth, and to lead my bride to the altar.

MILLER. Dost thou hear him, my child? Dost thou hear him mock at thy cheated hopes? Oh, truly, baron! It is so worthy of the deceiver to make a jest of his own crime!

FERDINAND. You think I am jesting? By my honor I am not! My protestations are as true as the love of my Louisa, and I will keep them as sacred as she has kept her oaths. Nothing to me is more sacred. Can you still doubt? Still no joyful blush upon the cheek of my fair bride? 'Tis strange! Falsehood must needs be here the current coin, since truth finds so little credit. You mistrust my words, it seems? Then read this written testimony. (He throws LOUISA her letter to the MARSHAL. She opens it, and sinks upon the floor pale as death.)

MILLER (not observing this). What can this mean, baron? I do not understand you.

FERDINAND. (leads him to LOUISA). But your daughter has understood me well.

MILLER (throws himself on his knees beside her). Oh, God! My child!

FERDINAND. Pale as a corpse! 'Tis thus your daughter pleases me the best. Your demure and virtuous daughter was never half so lovely as with that deathlike paleness. The blast of the day of judgment, which strips the varnish from every lie, has wafted the painted colors from her cheek, or the juggler might have cheated even the angels of light. This is her fairest countenance. Now for the first time do I see it in its truth. Let me kiss it. (He approaches her.)

MILLER. Back! Away, boy! Trifle not with a father's feelings. I could not defend her from your caresses, but I can from your insults.

FERDINAND. What wouldst thou, old man? With thee I have naught to do. Engage not in a game so irrevocably lost. Or hast thou, too, been wiser than I thought? Hast thou employed the wisdom of thy sixty years in pandering to thy daughter's amours, and disgraced those hoary locks with the office of a pimp? Oh! if it be not so, wretched old man, then lay thyself down and die. There is still time. Thou mayest breathe by last in the sweet delusion, “I was a happy father!” Wait but a moment longer and thine own hand will dash to her infernal home this poisonous viper; thou wilt curse the gift, and him who gave it, and sink to the grave in blasphemy and despair. (To LOUISA.) Speak, wretched one, speak! Didst thou write this letter?

MILLER (to LOUISA, impressively). For God's sake, daughter, forget not! Forget not!

LOUISA. Oh, father-that letter!

FERDINAND. Oh! That it should have fallen into the wrong hands.Now blessed be the accident! It has effected more than the most consummate prudence, and will at the day of judgment avail more than the united wisdom of sages. Accident, did I say? Oh!Providence directs, when a sparrow falls, why not when a devil is unmasked? But I will be answered! Didst thou write that letter?

MILLER (to LOUISA, in a tone of entreaty). Be firm, my child, be firm!But a single “Yes,” and all will be over.

FERDINAND. Excellent! Excellent! The father, too, is deceived! All, all are deceived by her! Look, how the perfidious one stands there;even her tongue refuses participation in her last lie. I adjure thee by that God so terrible and true-didst thou write that letter?

LOUISA (after a painful struggle, with firmness and decision). I did!

FERDINAND (stands aghast). No! As my soul liveth, thou hast lied.Even innocence itself, when extended on the rack, confesses crime which it never committed-I ask too passionately. Is it not so, Louisa? Thou didst but confess, because I asked passionately?

LOUISA. I confessed the truth!

FERDINAND. No, I tell thee! No! No! Thou didst not write that letter! It is not like thy hand! And, even though it were, why should it be more difficult to counterfeit a writing than to undo a heart? Tell me truly, Louisa! Yet no, no, do not! Thou mightest say yes again, and then I were lost forever. A lie, Louisa! A lie! Oh! If thou didst but know one now-if thou wouldst utter it with that open angelic mien-if thou wouldst but persuade mine ear and eye, though it should deceive my heart ever so monstrously! Oh, Louisa! Then might truth depart in the same breath-depart from our creation, and the sacred cause itself henceforth bow her stiff neck to the courtly arts of deception.

LOUISA. By the Almighty God! By Him who is so terrible and true! I did!

FERDINAND (after a pause, with the expression of the most heartfelt sorrow). Woman! Woman! With what a face thou standest now before me! Offer Paradise with that look, and even in the regions of the damned thou wilt find no purchaser. Didst thou know what thou wert to me, Louisa? Impossible! No! Thou knewest not that thou wert my all-all! 'Tis a poor insignificant word! But eternity itself can scarcely circumscribe it. Within it systems of worlds can roll their mighty orbs. All! And to sport with it so wickedly. Oh,'tis horrible.

LOUISA. Baron von Walter, you have heard my confession! I have pronounced my own condemnation! Now go! Fly from a house where you have been so unhappy.

FERDINAND. 'Tis well! 'Tis well! You see I am calm; calm, too, they say, is the shuddering land through which the plague has swept.I am calm. Yet ere I go, Louisa, one more request! It shall be my last. My brain burns with fever! I need refreshment! Will you make me some lemonade?

[Exit LOUISA.





SCENE III.


FERDINAND and MILLER.



They both pace up and down without speaking, on opposite sides of the room, for some minutes.





MILLER (standing still at length, and regarding the MAJOR with a sorrowful air). Dear baron, perhaps it may alleviate your distress to say that I feel for you most deeply.

FERDINAND. Enough of this, Miller. (Silence again for some moments.) Miller, I forget what first brought me to your house.What was the occasion of it?

MILLER. How, baron? Don't you remember? You came to take lessons on the flute.

FERDINAND (suddenly). And I beheld his daughter! (Another pause.)You have not kept your faith with me, friend! You were to provide me with repose for my leisure hours; but you betrayed me and sold me scorpions. (Observing MILLER's agitation.) Tremble not, good old man! (falling deeply affected on his neck)-The fault was none of thine!

MILLER (wiping his eyes). Heaven knows, it was not!

FERDINAND (traversing the room, plunged in the most gloomy meditation). Strange! Oh! Beyond conception strange, are the Almighty's dealings with us! How often do terrific weights hang upon slender, almost invisible threads! Did man but know that he should eat death in a particular apple! Hem! Could he but know that! (He walks a few more turns; then stops suddenly, and grasps MILLER's hand with strong emotion.) Friend, I have paid dearly for thy lessons-and thou, too, hast been no gainer- perhaps mayst even lose thy all. (Quitting him dejectedly.) Unhappy flute-playing, would that it never entered my brain!

MILLER (striving to repress his feelings). The lemonade is long in coming. I will inquire after it, if you will excuse me.

FERDINAND. No hurry, dear Miller! (Muttering to himself.) At least to her father there is none. Stay here a moment. What was I about to ask you? Ay, I remember! Is Louisa your only daughter? Have you no other child?

MILLER (warmly). I have no other, baron, and I wish for no other. That child is my only solace in this world, and on her have I embarked my whole stock of affection.

FERDINAND (much agitated). Ha! Pray see for the drink, good Miller![Exit MILLER.





SCENE IV.


FERDINAND alone.





FERDINAND. His only child! Dost thou feel that, murderer? His only one! Murderer, didst thou hear, his only one? The man has nothing in God's wide world but his instrument and that only daughter!And wilt thou rob him of her?

Rob Him? Rob a beggar of his last pittance? Break the lame man's crutch, and cast the fragments at his feet? How? Have I the heart to do this? And when he hastens home, impatient to reckon in his daughter's smiles the whole sum of his happiness; and when he enters the chamber, and there lies the rose-withered-dead-crushed-his last, his only, his sustaining hope. Ha! And when he stands before her, and all nature looks on in breathless horror, while his vacant eye wanders hopelessly through the gloom of futurity, and seeks God, but finds him nowhere, and then returns disappointed and despairing! Great God! And has not my father, too, an only son? An only child, but not his only treasure. (After a pause.) Yet stay! What will the old man lose? She who could wantonly jest with the most sacred feelings of love, will she make a father happy? She cannot! She will not! And I deserve thanks for crushing this viper ere the parent feels its sting.





SCENE V.


MILLER returning, and FERDINAND.





MILLER. You shall be served instantly, baron! The poor thing is sitting without, weeping as though her heart would break! Your drink will be mingled with her tears.

FERDINAND. 'Twere well for her were it only with tears! We were speaking of my lessons, Miller. (Taking out a purse.) I remember that I am still in your debt.

MILLER. How? What? Go along with you, baron! What do you take me for? There is time enough for payment. Do not put such an affront on me; we are not together for the last time, please God.

FERDINAND. Who can tell? Take your money. It is for life or death.

MILLER (laughing). Oh! For the matter of that, baron! As regards that I don't think I should run much risk with you!

FERDINAND. You would run the greatest. Have you never heard that youths have died. That damsels and youths have died, the children of hope, the airy castles of their disappointed parents? What is safe from age and worms has often perished by a thunderbolt. Even your Louisa is not immortal.

MILLER. God gave her to me.

FERDINAND. Hear me! I say to you your Louisa is not immortal. That daughter is the apple of your eye; you hang upon her with your whole heart and soul. Be prudent, Miller! None but a desperate gamester stakes his all upon a single cast. The merchant would be called a madman who embarked his whole fortune in one ship.Think upon this, and remember that I warned you. But why do you not take your money?

MILLER. How, baron, how? All that enormous purse? What can you be thinking of?

FERDINAND. Upon my debt! There! (Throws a heavy purse on the table; some gold drops out.) I cannot hold the dross to eternity.

MILLER (astonished). Mercy on us! What is this? The sound was not of silver! (Goes to the table and cries out in astonishment.) In heaven's name, baron, what means this? What are you about? You must be out of your mind! (Clasping his hands.) There it lies! Or I am bewitched. 'Tis damnable! I feel it now; the beauteous, shining, glorious heap of gold! No, Satan, thou shalt not catch my soul with this!

FERDINAND. Have you drunk old wine, or new, Miller?

MILLER (violently). Death and furies! Look yourself, then. It is gold!FERDINAND. And what of that?

MILLER. Let me implore you, baron! In the name of all the saints in heaven, I entreat you! It is gold!

FERDINAND. An extraordinary thing, it must be admitted.

MILLER (after a pause; addressing him with emotion). Noble sir, I am a plain, straightforward man-do you wish to tempt me to some piece of knavery?-For, heaven knows, that so much gold cannot be got honestly!

FERDINAND (moved). Make yourself quite easy, dear Miller! You have well earned the money. God forbid that I should use it to the corruption of your conscience!

MILLER (jumping about like a madman). It is mine, then! Mine indeed! Mine with the knowledge and consent of God! (Hastening to the door.) Daughter, wife, hurrah, come hither! (Returning.)But, for heaven's sake, how have I all at once deserved this awful treasure? How am I to earn it? How repay it, eh?

FERDINAND. Not by your music lessons, Miller! With this gold do I pay you for (stops suddenly, and shudders)-I pay you-(after a pause, with emotion)-for my three months' unhappy dream of your daughter!

MILLER (taking his hand and pressing it affectionately). Most gracious sir! Were you some poor and low-born citizen, and my daughter refused your love, I would pierce her heart with my own hands. (Returning to the gold in a sorrowful tone.) But then I shall have all, and you nothing- and I should have to give up all this glorious heap again, eh?

FERDINAND. Let not that thought distress you, friend. I am about to quit this country, and in that to which I am journeying such coin is not current.

MILLER (still fixing his eyes in transport on the money). Mine, then, it remains? Mine? Yet it grieves me that you are going to leave us. Only just wait a little and you shall see how I'll come out! I'll hold up my head with the best of them. (Puts on his hat with an air, and struts up and down the room.) I'll give my lessons in the great concert-room, and won't I smoke away at the best puyke varinas-and, when you catch me again fiddling at the penny-hop, may the devil take me!

FERDINAND. Stay, Miller! Be silent, and gather up your gold.(Mysteriously.) Keep silence only for this one evening, and do me the favor henceforward to give no more music lessons.

MILLER (still more vehemently grasping his hand, full of inward joy).And my daughter, baron! My daughter! (Letting go.) No, no!Money does not make the man-whether I feed on vegetables or on partridges, enough is enough, and this coat will do very well as long as the sunbeams don't peep in at the elbows. To me money is mere dross. But my girl shall benefit by the blessing; whatever wish I can read in her eyes shall be gratified.

FERDINAND (suddenly interrupting him). Oh! Silence! Silence!

MILLER (still more warmly). And she shall learn to speak French like a born native, and to dance minuets, and to sing, so that people shall read of her in the newspapers; and she shall wear a cap like the judge's daughter, and a kidebarri [meaning, no doubt, Cul de Paris, a bustle], as they call it; and the fiddler's daughter shall be talked of for twenty miles round.

FERDINAND. (seizing his hand in extreme agitation). No more! No more! For God's sake be silent! Be silent but for this one night; 'tis the only favor I ask of you.





SCENE VI.


LOUISA with a glass of lemonade; the former.





LOUISA (her eyes swelled with weeping, and trembling voice, while she presents the glass to FERDINAND). Tell me, if it be not to your taste.

FERDINAND (takes the glass, places it on the table, and turns to MILLER). Oh! I had almost forgotten! Good Miller, I have a request to make. Will you do me a little favor?

MILLER. A thousand with pleasure! What are your commands?

FERDINAND. My father will expect me at table. Unfortunately I am in very ill humor. 'Twould be insupportable to me just now to mix in society. Will you go to my father and excuse my absence?

LOUISA (terrified, interrupts him hastily). Oh, let me go!

MILLER. Am I to see the president himself?

FERDINAND. Not himself. Give your message to one of the servants in the ante-chamber. Here is my watch as a credential that I sent you. I shall be here when you return. You will wait for an answer.

LOUISA (very anxiously). Cannot I be the bearer of your message?

FERDINAND (to MILLER, who is going). Stay-one thing more! Here is a letter to my father, which I received this evening enclosed in one to myself. Perhaps on business of importance. You may as well deliver it at the same time.

MILLER (going). Very well, baron!

LOUISA (stopping him, and speaking in a tone of the most exquisite terror). But, dear father, I could do all this very well! Pray let me go!

MILLER. It is night, my child! And you must not venture out alone![Exit.

FERDINAND. Light your father down, Louisa. (LOUISA takes a candle and follows MILLER. FERDINAND in the meantime approaches the table and throws poison into the lemonade). Yes!She must die! The higher powers look down, and nod their terrible assent. The vengeance of heaven subscribes to my decree. Her good angels forsake her, and leave her to her fate!





SCENE VII.


FERDINAND and LOUISA.



LOUISA re-enters slowly with the light, places it on the table, and stops on the opposite side of the room, her eyes fixed on the ground, except when she raises them to him with timid, stolen glances. He stands opposite, looking steadfastly on the earth-a long and deep silence.





LOUISA. If you will accompany me, Baron von Walter, I will try a piece on the harpsichord! (She opens the instrument. FERDINAND makes no answer. A pause.)

LOUISA. You owe me a revenge at chess. Will you play a game with me, Baron von Walter? (Another pause.)

LOUISA. I have begun the pocketbook, baron, which I promised to embroider for you. Will you look at the design? (Still a pause.)

LOUISA. Oh! I am very wretched!

FERDINAND (without changing his attitude). That may well be!

LOUISA. It is not my fault, Baron von Walter, that you are so badly entertained!

FERDINAND (with an insulting laugh). You are not to blame for my bashful modesty——

LOUISA. I am quite aware that we are no longer fit companions. I confess that I was terrified when you sent away my father. I believe, Baron von Walter, that this moment is equally insupportable to us both. Permit me to ask some of my acquaintances to join us.

FERDINAND. Yes, pray do so! And I too will go and invite some of mine.

LOUISA (looking at him with surprise). Baron von Walter!

FERDINAND (very spitefully). By my honor, the most fortunate idea that in our situation could ever enter mortal brain? Let us change this wearisome duet into sport and merriment, and by the aid of certain gallantries, revenge ourselves on the caprices of love.

LOUISA. You are merry, Baron von Walter!

FERDINAND. Oh! Wonderfully so! The very street-boys would hunt me through the market-place for a merry-andrew! In fact, Louisa, your example has inspired me-you shall be my teacher. They are fools who prate of endless affection-never-ending sameness grows flat and insipid-variety alone gives zest to pleasure. Have with you, Louisa, we are now of one mind. We will skip from amour to amour, whirl from vice to vice; you in one direction, I in another. Perhaps I may recover my lost tranquillity in some brothel. Perhaps, when our merry race is run, and we become two mouldering skeletons, chance again may bring us together with the most pleasing surprise, and we may, as in a melodrama, recognize each other by a common feature of disease-that mother whom her children can never disavow. Then, perhaps, disgust and shame may create that union between us which could not be effected by the most tender love.

LOUISA. Oh, Walter! Walter! Thou art already unhappy-wilt thou deserve to be so?

FERDINAND (muttering passionately through his teeth). Unhappy?Who told thee so? Woman, thou art too vile to have any feelings of thine own; how, then, canst thou judge of the feelings of others?Unhappy, did she say?-Ha! That word would call my anger from the grave! She knew that I must become unhappy. Death and damnation! She knew it, and yet betrayed me! Look to it, serpent!That was thy only chance of forgiveness. This confession has condemned thee. Till now I thought to palliate thy crime with thy simplicity, and in my contempt thou hadst well nigh escaped my vengeance (seizing the glass hastily). Thou wert not thoughtless, then- thou wert not simple-thou wert nor more nor less than a devil! (He drinks.) The drink is bad, like thy soul! Taste it!

LOUISA. Oh, heavens! 'Twas not without reason that I dreaded this meeting.

FERDINAND (imperiously). Drink! I say.

[LOUISA, offended, takes the glass and drinks. The moment she raises the cup to her lips, FERDINAND turns away with a sudden paleness, and recedes to the further corner of the chamber.]



LOUISA. The lemonade is good.

FERDINAND (his face averted and shuddering.) Much good may it do thee!

LOUISA (sets down the glass). Oh! Could you but know, Walter, how cruelly you wrong me!

FERDINAND. Indeed!

LOUISA. A time will come, Walter——

FERDINAND (advancing). Oh! We have done with time.

LOUISA. When the remembrance of this evening will lie heavy on your heart!

FERDINAND (begins to walk to and fro more vehemently, and to become more agitated; he throws away his sash and sword.) Farewell the prince's service!

LOUISA. My God! What mean you!

FERDINAND. I am hot, and oppressed. I would be more at ease.

LOUISA. Drink! Drink! It will cool you.

FERDINAND. That it will, most effectually. The strumpet, though, is kind-hearted! Ay, ay, so are they all!

LOUISA (rushing into his arms with the deepest expression of love). That to thy Louisa, Ferdinand?

FERDINAND (thrusting her from him). Away! Away! Hence with those soft and melting eyes! They subdue me. Come to me, snake, in all thy monstrous terrors! Spring upon me, scorpion! Display thy hideous folds, and rear thy proud coils to heaven! Stand before my eyes, hateful as the abyss of hell e'er saw thee! But not in that angel form! Take any shape but that! 'Tis too late. I must crush thee like a viper, or despair! Mercy on thy soul!

LOUISA. Oh! That it should come to this!

FERDINAND (gazing on her). So fair a work of the heavenly artist! Who would believe it? Who can believe it? (Taking her hand and elevating it.) I will not arraign thy ordinations, Oh! Incomprehensible Creator! Yet wherefore didst thou pour thy poison into such beauteous vessels? Can crime inhabit so fair a region? Oh! 'Tis strange! 'Tis passing strange!

LOUISA. To hear this, and yet be compelled to silence!

FERDINAND. And that soft, melodious voice! How can broken chords discourse such harmony? (Gazing rapturously upon her figure.) All so lovely! So full of symmetry! So divinely perfect!Throughout the whole such signs that'twas the favorite work of God! By heaven, as though all mankind had been created but to practise the Creator, ere he modelled this his masterpiece! And that the Almighty should have failed in the soul alone? Is it possible that this monstrous abortion of nature should have escaped as perfect? (Quitting her hastily.) Or did God see an angel's form rising beneath his chisel, and balance the error by giving her a heart wicked in proportion?

LOUISA. Alas for this criminal wilfulness! Rather than confess his own rashness, he accuses the wisdom of heaven!

FERDINAND (falls upon her neck, weeping bitterly). Yet once more, my Louisa! Yet once again, as on the day of our first kiss, when you faltered forth the name of Ferdinand, and the first endearing“Thou!” Trembled on thy burning lips. Oh! A harvest of endless and unutterable joys seemed to me at that moment to be budding forth. There lay eternity like a bright May-day before our eyes;thousands of golden years, fair as brides, danced around our souls.Then was I so happy! Oh! Louisa! Louisa! Louisa! Why hast thou used me thus?

LOUISA. Weep, Walter, weep! Your compassion will be more just towards me than your wrath.

FERDINAND. You deceive yourself. These are not nature's tears! Not that warm delicious dew which flows like balsam on the wounded soul, and drives the chilled current of feeling swiftly along its course. They are solitary ice-cold drops! The awful, eternal farewell of my love! (With fearful solemnity, laying his hand on her head.) They are tears for thy soul, Louisa! Tears for the Deity, whose inexhaustible beneficence has here missed its aim, and whose noblest work is cast away thus wantonly. Oh methinks the whole universe should clothe itself in black, and weep at the fearful example now passing in its centre. 'Tis but a common sorrow when mortals fall and Paradise is lost; but, when the plague extends its ravages to angels, then should there be wailing throughout the whole creation!

LOUISA. Drive me not to extremities, Walter. I have fortitude equal to most, but it must not be tried by a more than human test. Walter!One word, and then-we part forever. A dreadful fatality has deranged the language of our hearts. Dared I unclose these lips, Walter, I could tell thee things! I could——but cruel fate has alike fettered my tongue and my heart, and I must endure in silence, even though you revile me as a common strumpet.

FERDINAND. Dost thou feel well, Louisa?

LOUISA. Why that question?

FERDINAND. It would grieve me shouldst thou be called hence with a lie upon thy lips.

LOUISA. I implore you, Walter——

FERDINAND (in violent agitation). No! No! That revenge were too satanic! No! God forbid! I will not extend my anger beyond the grave! Louisa, didst thou love the marshal? Thou wilt leave this room no more!

LOUISA (sitting down). Ask what you will. I shall give no answer.

FERDINAND (in a solemn voice). Take heed for thy immortal soul!Louisa! Didst thou love the marshal? Thou wilt leave this room no more!

LOUISA. I shall give no answer.

FERDINAND (throwing himself on his knees before her in the deepest emotion). Louisa! Didst thou love the marshal? Before this light burns out-thou wilt stand-before the throne of God!

LOUISA (starting from her seat in terror). Merciful Jesus! What was that? And I feel so ill! (She falls back into her chair.)

FERDINAND. Already? Oh, woman, thou eternal paradox! Thy delicate nerves can sport with crimes at which manhood trembles;yet one poor grain of arsenic destroys them utterly!

LOUISA. Poison! Poison! Oh! Almighty God!

FERDINAND. I fear it is so! Thy lemonade was seasoned in hell!Thou hast pledged death in the draught!

LOUISA. To die! To die! All-merciful God! Poison in my drink! And to die! Oh! Have mercy on my soul, thou Father in heaven!

FERDINAND. Ay, be that thy chief concern: I will join thee in that prayer.

LOUISA. And my mother! My father, too! Saviour of the world! My poor forlorn father! Is there then no hope? And I so young, and yet no hope? And must I die so soon?

FERDINAND. There is no hope! None!-You are already doomed!But be calm. We shall journey together.

LOUISA. Thou too, Ferdinand? Poison, Ferdinand! From thee! Oh!God forgive him! God of mercy, lay not this crime on him!

FERDINAND. Look to your own account. I fear it stands but ill.

LOUISA. Ferdinand! Ferdinand! Oh! I can be no longer silent. Death-death absolves all oaths. Ferdinand! Heaven and earth contain nothing more unfortunate than thou! I die innocent, Ferdinand!

FERDINAND (terrified). Ah! What do I hear? Would she rush into the presence of her Maker with a lie on her lips?

LOUISA. I lie not! I do not lie! In my whole life I never lied but once!Ugh! What an icy shivering creeps through my veins! When I wrote that letter to the marshal.

FERDINAND. Ha! That letter! Blessed be to God! Now I am myself again!

LOUISA (her voice every moment becomes more indistinct. Her fingers tremble with a convulsive motion). That letter. Prepare yourself for a terrible disclosure! My hand wrote what my heart abhorred.It was dictated by your father! (Ferdinand stands like a statue petrified with horror. After a long silence, he falls upon the floor as if struck by lightning.) Oh! That sorrowful act!——Ferdinand-I was compelled- forgive me-thy Louisa would have preferred death-but my father-his life in danger! They were so crafty in their villany.

FERDINAND (starting furiously from the ground). God be thanked! The poison spares me yet! (He seizes his sword.)

LOUISA (growing weaker by degrees). Alas! What would you? He is thy father!

FERDINAND (in the most ungovernable fury). A murderer-the murderer of his son; he must along with us that the Judge of the world may pour his wrath on the guilty alone. (Hastening away).

LOUISA. My dying Redeemer pardoned his murderers, -may God pardon thee and thy father! (She dies.)

FERDINAND (turns quickly round, and perceives her in the convulsions of death, throws himself distractedly on the body). Stay!Stay! Fly not from me, angel of light! (Takes her hand, but lets it fall again instantly.) Cold! Cold and damp! Her soul has flown!(Starting up suddenly.) God of my Louisa! Mercy! Mercy for the most accursed of murderers! Such was her dying prayer! How fair, how lovely even in death! The pitying destroyer has touched gently on those heavenly features. That sweetness was no mask-the hand of death even has not removed it! (After a pause.) But how is this? Why do I feel nothing. Will the vigor of my youth save me?Thankless care! That shall it not. (He seizes the glass.)





SCENE VIII.


FERDINAND, the PRESIDENT, WORM, and SERVANTS, who all rush in alarm into the room. Afterwards MILLER, with a crowd, and OFFICERS of justice, who assemble in the background.





PRESIDENT (an open letter in his hand). My son! What means this? I never can believe——

FERDINAND (throwing the glass at his feet). Convince thyself, murderer! (The PRESIDENT staggers back. All stand speechless. A dreadful pause.)

PRESIDENT. My son! Why hast thou done this?

FERDINAND (without looking at him). Why, to be sure I ought first to have asked the statesman whether the trick suited his cards.Admirably fine and skilful, I confess, was the scheme of jealousy to break the bond of our hearts! The calculation shows a master-mind;'twas pity only that indignant love would not move on wires like thy wooden puppets.

PRESIDENT (looking round the circle with rolling eyes). Is there no one here who weeps for a despairing father?

MILLER (calling behind the SCENEs). Let me in! For God's sake, let me in!

FERDINAND. She is now a saint in heaven! Her cause is in the hands of another! (He opens the door for MILLER, who rushes in, followed by officers of justice and a crowd of people.)

MILLER (in the most dreadful alarm). My child! My child! Poison, they cry-poison has been here! My daughter! Where art thou?

FERDINAND (leading him between the PRESIDENT and LOUISA's corpse). I am innocent. Thank this man for the deed.

MILLER (throwing himself on the body). Oh, Jesus!

FERDINAND. In few words, father!-They begin to be precious to me. I have been robbed of my life by villanous artifice-robbed of it by you! How I may stand with God I tremble to think, but a deliberate villain I have never been! Be my final judgment what it will, may it not fall on thee! But I have committed murder! (In a loud and fearful voice.) A murder whose weight thou canst not hope that I should drag alone before the judgment-seat of God. Here I solemnly bequeath to thee the heaviest, the bloodiest part; how thou mayst answer it be that thy care! (Leading him to LOUISA.)Here, barbarian! Feast thine eyes on the terrible fruits of thy intrigues! Upon this face thy name is inscribed in the convulsions of death, and will be registered by the destroying angel! May a form like this draw thy curtain when thou sleepest, and grasp thee with its clay-cold hand! May a form like this flit before thy soul when thou diest, and drive away thy expiring prayer for mercy!May a form like this stand by thy grave at the resurrection, and before the throne of God when he pronounces thy doom! (He faints, the servants receive him in their arms.)

PRESIDENT (extending his arms convulsively towards heaven). Not from me, Judge of the world. Ask not these souls from me, but from him! (Pointing to WORM.)

WORM (starting). From me?

PRESIDENT. Accursed villain, from thee! From thee, Satan! Thou gavest the serpent's counsel! Thine be the responsibility; their blood be not on my head, but on thine!

WORM. On mine! On mine! (laughing hysterically.) Oh! Excellent!Now I understand the gratitude of devils. On mine, thou senseless villain! Was he my son? Was I thy master? Mine the responsibility?Ha! By this sight which freezes the very marrow in my bones!Mine it shall be! I will brave destruction, but thou shalt perish with me. Away! Away! Cry murder in the streets! Awaken justice! Bind me, officers! Lead me hence! I will discover secrets which shall make the hearer's blood run cold. (Going.)

PRESIDENT (detaining him). Surely, madman, thou wilt not dare?

WORM (tapping him on the shoulder). I will, though,-comrade, I will!I am mad, 'tis true; but my madness is thy work, and now I will act like a madman! Arm in arm with thee will I to the scaffold! Arm in arm with thee to hell! Oh! How it tickles my fancy, villain, to be damned with thee! (The officers carry him off.)

MILLER (who has lain upon LOUISA's corpse in silent anguish, starts suddenly up, and throws the purse before the MAJOR's feet.)Poisoner, take back thy accursed gold! Didst thou think to purchase my child with it? (Rushes distractedly out of the chamber.)

FERDINAND (in a voice scarcely audible). Follow him! He is desperate. The gold must be taken care of for his use; 'tis the dreadful acknowlegment of my debt to him. Louisa! I come!Farewell! On this altar let me breathe my last.

PRESIDENT (recovering from his stupor). Ferdinand! My son! Not one last look for a despairing father? (FERDINAND is laid by the side of LOUISA.)

FERDINAND. My last must sue to God for mercy on myself.

PRESIDENT (falling down before him in the most dreadful agony). The Creator and the created abandon me! Not one last look to cheer me in the hour of death! (FERDINAND stretches out his trembling hand to him, and expires.)

PRESIDENT (springing up). He forgave me! (To the OFFICERS.)Now, lead on, sirs! I am your prisoner.

[Exit, followed by the OFFICERS; the curtain falls.
