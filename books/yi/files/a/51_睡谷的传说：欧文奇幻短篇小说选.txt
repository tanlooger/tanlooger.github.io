从独立战争到南北战争，一般被称为美国的浪漫主义文学时期。在这个时期，涌现了一批文学史上的重要人物，如华盛顿·欧文、詹姆斯·库柏、纳撒尼尔·霍桑、爱伦·坡和惠特曼等。他们不仅推动了美国文学的发展，也为世界文学增色不少。尤其是华盛顿·欧文更是独领风骚，起着开拓者的作用。他的创作震惊了美国文坛，也在英国文坛掀起了轩然大波，令“老大哥”英国文学家们刮目相看，称他为“美国文学之父”。

华盛顿·欧文（1783—1859）是苏格兰裔的美国人，其父年轻时从苏格兰迁居纽约，在纽约发了大财，家境富裕。欧文受哥哥的影响，自小酷爱文学，博览群书，最叫他陶醉的是彭斯、拜伦、司各特等英国浪漫主义作家的作品。1802年，19岁的欧文在《早晨纪事报》上发表了几篇书信体散文，崭露头角。1804年，他走出国门到欧洲旅行（这是他的第一次欧洲之旅），游历了法国、英国和意大利等国，历时两年，深为辉煌的欧洲文化而激动，写下了大量的旅行笔记。1815年，他第二次到欧洲去，一住就是十七年，先是经商，后供职于美国驻英使馆。1842—1846年，他三度赴欧，出任驻西班牙公使。粗略计算，他在青壮年时期，在欧洲居住了长达二十一年之久。在此期间，他跑遍了英、法、德、意、西等国，还拜访过司各特、萨克雷等著名作家。与刚刚建立不久的美利坚合众国相比，欧洲有着灿烂的历史和悠久丰富的文化，具有震撼人心的力量。从某种角度来说，欧文虽是“美国文学之父”，却又是“欧洲文学之子”。在这一点上，欧文是一种象征，象征着美国文学对欧洲文学的继承、发展和创新。

欧文著述颇丰，有历史小说、人物传记等，而他最擅长的是札记、散文、随笔、故事之类随心所欲的自由文体。1809年，他出版了第一部作品《纽约外史》。这部小说以诙谐幽默的笔调抨击了荷兰殖民者的残忍和狡诈，对受到不公正待遇的土著人深表同情。这是一部具有独特风格的诙谐之作，充分显露出欧文的幽默才能。《纽约外史》出版后，欧文成为纽约文坛风靡一时的人物。1820年，他在英国出版了《见闻札记》，更使他成为在欧洲为美国文学赢得声誉的第一人。此书并非鸿篇巨制，只是一本包括34篇散文、故事、杂感的文集，其中包含着作者对欧洲文明的敬仰之情，也表现了美国人的幽默诙谐，因而受到欧美广大读者的欢迎，成为美国文学的开山之作。

《见闻札记》中，以短篇小说《瑞普·凡·温克》最为著名。该小说的创作受德国民间故事《睡皇帝》启发。故事的背景是荷兰殖民地时期的美国乡村。在一个僻静的小村庄里住着一个叫瑞普·凡·温克的农夫，过着游游荡荡的悠闲日子，唯一不顺心的是“家有悍妇”。为了躲避“悍妇”的辱骂，他独自到附近的山里去打猎，不期遇到了当年发现了哈德逊河的哈德逊船长及其伙伴，在喝了他们的仙酒后，就睡了一觉。醒后下山回家，才发现时间已过了整整二十年。旧日的景象不复存在，自己所熟悉的小村庄彻底改变了容颜，寂静被打破，到处是演说、传单和竞选。瑞普终于知道，他现在已由英王的臣民变为“合众国的一个自由的公民”。一切都是那么陌生。唯一叫他感到庆幸的是，那个折磨得他生不如死的彪悍妻子被一个小贩气死，“妇人专政”终于结束了。瑞普做了一场梦，而美国则产生了翻天覆地的变化。他摆脱了“妇人专政”，而美国摆脱的却是“英国专政”。一个重大的历史事件，一次剧烈的革命性转折，竟被欧文以轻轻松松的一场梦给交代了。以轻松幽默的笔调反映沉重的历史——这是欧文创作的一个显著特征，不得不令人佩服。

1877年，清朝官员张德彝出访英国时，观看了根据欧文的《瑞普·凡·温克》改编的戏剧。回国后，张德彝在出访记录中记述了对它的感受。三十年后，晚清著名翻译家林纾将欧文的《见闻札记》翻译成中文，取名《拊掌录》。林纾在序中说：“欧文气量宏广，而思致深邃而便敏，行文跳踊变化，匪夷所思。其雅趣高情……又博古，广哀遗典，叩以所有，无不立应。”

《睡谷的传说》也是《见闻札记》中一个影响力非常大的故事。睡谷是真实存在的地点，位于哈德逊河畔，这个故事以欧文拜访睡谷时听到的传说为基础创作。睡谷当中雾气腾腾、阴气逼人，据说巫师给这儿施了妖术，让居民们的大脑受到控制，连走路也晕晕乎乎如在梦中。当地居民最为津津乐道的都是些惊悚的鬼怪故事和传说。其中无头骑士的故事流传最广。传说在美国独立战争时期的一次战役中，一个黑森州骑兵的头被炮弹打飞了。死后，他的阴魂常在夜里骑马飞奔，到战场上去寻找自己的头颅。这篇故事将幻想和现实融于一处，营造出一种诡异而怪诞的气氛，对愚昧和残暴进行无情的鞭挞。

《睡谷的传说》自问世后，即受到广大读者的喜欢，其诡谲的气氛、离奇的情节，更是受到许多戏剧家、影视导演的青睐。1922年即被搬上银幕，此后又有多个影视版本相继面世，其中不乏影响力深远之作，如1999年由蒂姆·波顿指导、约翰尼·德普主演的电影。2013年由福克斯电视台制作的电视剧《沉睡谷》融合了《睡谷的传说》和《瑞普·凡·温克》两个故事的背景，并在睡谷实地拍摄。目前已经播放了三季，第四季正在制作当中。

除了这两个故事，本书还精选了欧文另外几篇同样精彩的短篇小说——《鬼新郎》《魔鬼和汤姆·沃克》《阿拉伯占星家的传说》以及《摩尔人遗产的传说》。

《鬼新郎》以跌宕起伏的故事情节吸引住读者的注意力，歌颂友谊与爱情，对美国文学的影响十分深刻。《魔鬼和汤姆·沃克》情节有点类似歌德的《浮士德》，讲的是一个人为了达到自己卑鄙的目的，不惜把灵魂出卖给魔鬼。《阿拉伯占星家的传说》里，欧文利用一个流传很广的传说，揭露了侵略成性的统治者阿本·哈布兹残忍而荒淫的面目，以及道貌岸然、以哲人自居的占星家的卑鄙丑恶的灵魂。在《摩尔人遗产的传说》里，欧文塑造了朴实勤劳、见义勇为的卖水贩子佩雷吉尔，还以辛辣的笔锋刻画出了贪婪暴戾的市长及警察的丑恶嘴脸，将这些人放在一处进行比较，以期达到扬善抑恶的目的。

1859年11月28日，欧文心脏病发逝世。当年12月的麻省历史学会会议之上，他的朋友，诗人朗费罗这样赞扬欧文对于美国文学的巨大推动和促进作用：“我们对于他身为一个作家的荣誉感到自豪，不过最不能忽略的，他最值得我们感激的，是他在文学的历史上为我们国家赢得的名声和地位。”

瑞普·凡·温克


下面的故事是在已故的迪德里克·尼克博克(1)的遗稿里发现的。尼克博克生前是纽约的一位老绅士，对该省的荷兰殖民史颇感兴趣，醉心于研究该省原始定居者后裔的风土人情。不过，他的历史研究并不是仅仅查阅资料，更是深入民间、了解民情。因为，凡是他感兴趣的题目，资料都少得可怜，但他发现民间的那些老人，尤其是老太太，知道许许多多民间传说——这些传说对发掘真实的历史弥足珍贵。每当他看到一户地地道道的荷兰人家安居于屋顶低矮的农舍，在浓荫如盖的梧桐树的遮掩下过着与世隔绝的日子，便如获至宝，将其视为印满古旧文字的珍稀卷册，投注以狂热的激情加以研究。

在这些研究的基础上，他编写了该省的历史书，反映荷兰总督执政时的那段如烟的往事，几年之后得以出版。对于书中的文学特色，人们看法不一，众说纷纭，实不相瞒，至今非议之声仍不减当年。此书的最大优点在于它的严谨和精确，虽问世之初也曾被质疑过，但后成定论，现已成为公认的权威史书，观点被纳入所有的史料。

这本书出版后不久，老绅士便辞世了。他已驾鹤西去，此刻说句遗憾的话也不至于有损他的形象——也许，他应该从事分量更重的研究。不过，话又说回来，人各有志，各有各的兴趣所在。此书固然时不时会令邻人的目光黯淡，叫一些朋友伤感（对于这些人，他怀有真诚的敬意和深沉的爱），但人们忆及他的错误和愚蠢，感到“悲哀多于愤怒”。人们不由会想到，他的初衷绝不会是想给别人带来伤害，也不会是想得罪任何人。不管评论家对他有什么样的看法，老百姓一般都对他颇有好感，而民意是值得尊重的；特别是一些面包师，他们甚至会把他的肖像印在新年蛋糕上，使他得以不朽于人间，其效果几乎等同于将他的肖像印在了滑铁卢奖牌或安妮女王的硬币上。





瑞普·凡·温克


迪德里希·尼克博克的遗作

啊，沃登，撒克逊人的天神，

有了你才有了沃登节这一星期三，

真理我将永铭心间，

直至我入土为安那一天……

——卡特赖特(2)

乘船在哈德逊河逆流而上，你肯定能记得卡茨基尔山，那是庞大的阿巴拉契亚山脉的一支断脉，位于大河的西岸，巍峨绵延，直插霄汉，鹤立鸡群般屹立于周围的景物之间。季节更迭，天气变幻，甚至每一小时的流逝，都会令山的色彩、山的形态发生变化。当地的主妇们，不论远近，都会将那山当作精确的晴雨表观看。天气晴好时，群山的颜色或蓝或紫，傍晚时分，雄浑的山影则映衬在清澈的天幕上。有时，他处万里无云，而高山之巅却轻雾缭绕。在落日的余晖中，像一顶璀璨的皇冠闪射出异彩。

乘船人放眼望去，可以看见美丽的群山脚下有一座村庄，村子里炊烟袅袅，农家的木屋顶掩映在一片树木中，而就在那儿，山的蓝色与山跟前的新绿交融在了一起。这是一个小村子，历史非常悠久，是在该省草创期由一些荷兰殖民者所建，大约正值好心的彼得·斯泰弗森特(3)（愿他的灵魂安息）开始执政之时。几年前这儿还矗立着几所最初的定居者居住的房屋，是用从荷兰运来的小块黄砖建造的，有格子窗和三角墙的面脸，屋顶上装着风向标。

就在这个村子里，就在这儿其中的一所房子里（说老实话，此房由于年代久远和风雨剥蚀，已经破烂不堪），曾经住着一个生性淳朴、性格温和的人，名叫瑞普·凡·温克。那是多年以前的旧事了，当时该地还属于大不列颠帝国治下的一个省。他是凡·温克一族的后代，其祖先在彼得·斯泰弗森特执政的骑士时代以骁勇善战著称，曾追随彼得围攻过克里斯蒂娜要塞。不过，他祖先的那种刚勇好斗的性格却几乎连一点都没有遗传给他。如我刚才所言，他是一个生性淳朴、性格温和的人；不仅如此，他还是个心地善良的邻居和对老婆百依百顺的“妻管严”丈夫。说实话，后一种情况的出现是由于他柔顺的性格，他也因此赢得了大家普遍的爱戴——男人在外边温和友好，平心静气地待人，都是家里有个母老虎把他调教出来的。这些男人的脾性，毫无疑问，都是在家里苦难的熔炉里千锤百炼，才变得百伶百俐、游刃有余了。看起来，要教人养成忍耐和坚忍的美德，床帷内的训导抵得过天下所有的循循善诱。因此，从某些方面来说，娶一个母老虎当妻子，也可以说是一种挺不错的福气。若依此理，瑞普·凡·温克便是洪福齐天了。

情况的确如此。村子里所有的贤妻良母都很喜欢他（女性一般都喜欢柔顺的男人），当他家出现争执时，则一边倒地站在他的一方，晚上唠嗑时谈及两口子的争执，毫无例外地都会把罪责归到凡·温克太太身上。村童们也喜欢他，见他走近，会高兴得喊叫起来。他跟孩子们一道玩耍，给他们做玩具，教他们放风筝和射弹球，还给他们讲很长很长的关于鬼怪、巫婆和印第安人的故事。他一出现在村头村尾，身边就会有一大群孩子簇拥，有的扯住他的衣摆，有的爬到他背上，无所顾忌地用各种办法拿他寻开心；就连附近的狗亦喜欢他，见了他叫都不叫一声。瑞普的性格中最大的缺陷，是对一切有益的劳动均具有不可克服的厌恶。这不可能是源于他缺乏持之以恒或坚持不懈的毅力。因为他可以坐在一块湿漉漉的石头上，拿着一根像鞑靼人的长矛似的又长又重的钓竿，钓上一整天鱼，哪怕没有一条鱼来咬饵，他也不会丧气，不会说一声牢骚话。他会肩扛一杆鸟枪，耗费好几个小时穿树林过沼泽，上山坡下峡谷，只为了打几只松鼠或野鸽子。谁家需要帮忙，他一定会出手相助，再累的活都不会在乎；乡间举办剥玉米或者筑石墙的活动，他历来都是头一个到场。村妇们经常支使他，叫他干些她们自己那不太听话的丈夫不愿意干的零碎活儿。总而言之，除了干自己家的活，任何人叫他帮忙他都乐意。至于料理自家的事务，耕种自家的农田，他则觉得比登天还难。实际情况是：他公开宣称说耕种自家的田纯粹是白费气力。他家的几亩薄田是整个地区最倒霉的农田，不管种什么，不管怎么种，都会出乱子。他家的篱笆墙经常倒塌；他家的牛不是走失便是跑到菜地里偷菜吃；他家农田里的野草总是比别家的长得快；每当他走出房门去田里干活，老天爷总会挑这个时候下雨。眼见得祖上留下的田产在他手里一英亩一英亩地少下去，最后只剩下了一块地种点玉米和马铃薯，而这块地仍然是附近一带顶顶差劲的。

他的几个孩子衣衫褴褛，像是没人管的野孩子。他的儿子小瑞普是个淘气包，长得像他，穿他的旧衣服，恐怕将来的生活习惯也会跟他一样。平时常见这小家伙屁颠屁颠跟在母亲的身后，像小马驹跟随着老马，穿着父亲丢掉的一条灯笼裤，用一只手费劲地往上提着，仿佛一位贵妇人在下雨天提着长长的裙裾。

好在瑞普·凡·温克属于那种乐天派，生就糊里糊涂、浑浑噩噩的性情，随遇而安地过日子，粗粮细粮无所谓，只要不费心思、不费气力，有吃的就行。他宁可只有一个便士而挨饿，也不愿为一个金镑去工作。假如叫他自己选择，他情愿吹着口哨轻松度日，心满意足地度过一生。可是他老婆却不停地在他耳边唠叨，怪他游手好闲，对家里的事不上心，把一个家都给毁了。不分早晨、中午还是夜间，她的责难之声不绝于耳，如果他胆敢还嘴或者有冒犯的举动，定会招来连珠炮似的训导和铺天盖地的抱怨。对于这类家训，瑞普只有一种办法，由于经常使用，逐渐成了习惯，那就是：耸耸肩、摇摇头、两眼看天，一声也不吭。可是，这种办法每一次都会招来老婆新一轮的发作，令他不得不撒丫子跑路，跑到门外去避难——说老实话，对于一个“妻管严”丈夫而言，这是唯一的退路了。

瑞普在家里的唯一追随者就是他那条名叫“狼”的狗，此狗和他一样惧怕女主人。凡·温克太太把他俩视为一对游手好闲的伙伴，甚至看“狼”的时候眼里会露出恶狠狠的神情，认为它是诱使它的主人整天出门游荡的罪魁祸首。其实，“狼”也具有一条可敬的狗所应有的全部精神，它跟任何出没于林中的动物一样勇敢——不过，哪一种勇气能抵挡得住一个女人那喋喋不休、恶言恶语的可怕舌头呢？一旦进入家里的房门，它就会垂下脑袋，尾巴拖地或者夹在两腿之间，胆战心惊的，一副马上就要上绞刑架的样子，不时拿眼偷窥凡·温克太太。后者只要举起笤帚把或者水瓢，它便箭一般夺门而逃，嘴里发出一阵哀鸣声。

结婚后，时光在一年年流逝，瑞普·凡·温克的日子越发艰难了。尖刻的脾性绝不会随年龄的增长而趋于温和，刻薄的舌头犹如利刃，越用越锋利。长时间以来，当他被迫走出家门时，他会去村子里的一个由智者、哲人及其他闲人组成的永久性俱乐部，在那儿寻求安慰。俱乐部的成员们坐在一家小客栈门前的长凳上聚会——小客栈用乔治三世陛下的肖像画当招牌（画中人红光满面）。夏天，他们躲在树荫下，懒洋洋地消磨一个个的长日，东一搭西一搭地议论议论村里的小道消息，要不就没完没了地讲故事——那些故事无聊乏味，令人昏昏欲睡。不过，有时旅人路过此地，偶尔会丢下一份旧报纸，可能会引发深刻的讨论，其见地恐怕也值得政治家花钱听一听的。小学校长德里克·凡·布麦尔衣冠楚楚，是个满腹经纶的小个子，即便是字典里最长的词也难不倒他。他为大家读报，语气郑重，而听者表情严肃，之后针对几个月前发生过的公众事件发表各自的真知灼见。

这个团体的议论导向完全由尼古拉斯·维德尔一手操纵。此人既是村子的一位元老，又是客栈的老板。他从早到晚一直坐在客栈门口，只在要躲避太阳光的时候才把座位稍微移动一下，以保证自己始终处于大树的阴凉之中。邻居们根据他的移动便可知时辰，准确得就跟观察日晷一样。其实，他很少讲话，只是一个劲地抽他的烟斗。不过，他的追随者们（伟人身后必有追随者）对他的一举一动都心领神会，可以揣摩出他的看法。当报上的事件或人们的议论叫他不高兴时，他会用劲地吸烟斗，一口接着一口气急败坏地把烟喷出来；而高兴时，他则慢悠悠、平心静气地将烟雾吸进嘴里，然后再轻轻地、平稳地吐出来，有时则是把烟斗从嘴边拿开，让香喷喷的烟气在鼻子边缭绕，一面庄严地点一点头，表示完全认可。

即使躲在这个堡垒里，倒霉的瑞普最后还是会被他凶悍的老婆赶出来。她会突然闯进来，搅乱这儿静谧的气氛，把与会者骂得狗血喷头；甚至连尼古拉斯·维德尔这等威严的人物也逃不脱这个可怕泼妇的污言秽语，她直截了当地指控他助长她丈夫游手好闲的恶习。

可怜的瑞普终于被逼到了几乎绝望的地步；要逃避田里的劳作和老婆的吵闹，也就只剩下拿起猎枪溜到树林里去这唯一的选择了。进了树林，他有时会在一棵树下坐下来，和“狼”一道分享袋子里的干粮。他同情“狼”，觉得它也是天涯沦落人，和他遭受着同样的迫害。“可怜的‘狼’啊，”他会说，“你的女主人叫你遭受折磨；不过别担心，我的孩子，只要我活着，就会有朋友帮你渡过难关！”“狼”听了直摇尾巴，深情地望着主人的脸。如果狗能够感受到这份同情心，那它一定会知恩图报的。

在一个秋高气爽的日子，瑞普又一次来林中漫游，不知不觉地爬上了卡茨基尔群山一处最高的峰顶。他来山里，是要用枪打松鼠的——这是他最喜欢的一项活动。砰砰砰，一声又一声的枪响回荡在山间。将近黄昏时分，他气喘吁吁，精疲力竭，便在悬崖上的一个长满野草的绿色小土墩上躺了下来。从树丛的空隙处，可以俯瞰低处连绵数英里的原野，那儿森林茂密，郁郁葱葱的。极目远眺，看得见在山下遥远的地方壮观的哈德逊河在流淌，静寂无声、气势磅礴地踏上了它的旅程，明镜似的河面上有的地方倒映着一片紫色的云彩，有的地方又点缀着一叶缓缓移动的孤帆，最后，河流隐没于蓝色的群山之间。

向另一侧望去，看得见下面一条幽深的山谷，荒凉、沉寂、杂草丛生，谷底堆满了从悬崖绝壁上坠落下来的乱石，落日的余晖几乎照不到那儿去。瑞普见景生情，沉思良久。暮色渐浓，群山投下长长的蓝色身影，遮在沟壑上。他明白，不等他回到村子里，天就会黑透的。一想到回家去面对叫人不寒而栗的凡·温克太太，他不禁沉重地叹了一口气。

他正欲下山，忽听远处有人在喊：“瑞普·凡·温克！瑞普·凡·温克！”他举目四看，周围并无一人，只看得见一只乌鸦孤零零地飞过山峰。他觉得一定是幻觉在欺骗自己，复又转身欲离去，谁料在苍茫、寂静的暮色里又听见了那叫喊声：“瑞普·凡·温克！瑞普·凡·温克！”“狼”听了，身上的毛都竖了起来，发出一声低沉的吠叫，躲闪到主人身边，惊恐地朝下面的山谷里张望。瑞普感到有点害怕，一阵战栗传遍了全身。他心怀恐惧，顺着狗的目光望去，见一个陌生人正吃力地一步一步慢慢爬上山来，背负重物，腰身都被压弯了。在这人迹罕至的荒山野岭竟然能看到人，叫他颇感诧异。他觉得来人八成是附近的人，需要他的帮助，于是急忙迎了过去。

走近时，见陌生人相貌古怪，他越发感到诧异了。对方是个老者，五短身材，胖墩墩的，头发浓密蓬松，胡须花白。此人身着古代荷兰装——上穿紧身背心，腰间扎一条皮带，下穿几条马裤，最外面的一条宽宽松松，两侧从上到下装饰着两排纽扣，膝盖处鼓起了两个大包。他肩上扛着一只大木桶，里面好像装满了酒。他招手让瑞普过去帮他一把。瑞普虽说有点犹豫，对这位新相识心存疑虑，但还是像往常一样，欣然出手相助。二人轮换着扛桶，沿着一条狭窄的溪谷往山上爬去——那溪谷显然是一条山涧干涸后留下的河道。路上，瑞普不时听到一阵阵滚动的隆隆声，像是远处在打雷。那声音似乎来自一条深谷，或者说是来自两座石山间的一个裂口，而他们脚下这条崎岖的小路正是通向那里的。他停下来听了听，猜想那是山区下雷阵雨夹带的雷声，于是就又朝前走了。

他们穿过深谷，来到一块凹地跟前——那凹地的形状像一个圆形小剧场，周围是悬崖峭壁，峭壁边缘上长着一些大树，伸展着枝丫，抬头看，只能从枝叶的缝隙间瞧见一线蓝天以及傍晚时分那亮亮的云彩。瑞普和他的同伴始终一声不吭地扛着桶前行。瑞普心里像个闷葫芦，不明白老者为何要扛着一桶酒到这荒山野岭里来，但对方怪模怪样，身上有一种叫人捉摸不透的东西，令他望而生畏，不敢与之交谈。走进剧场，眼前又出现了一幕奇怪的景象。但见剧场中央的一块平地上有几个模样古怪的人在玩九柱戏(4)。这些人的装束稀奇古怪，有的穿紧身短上衣，有的穿紧身背心，一个个腰带上挂着长刀，大多穿的裤子都肥肥大大，跟扛酒桶的老者所穿的是一个式样。论外表也都怪怪的——其中的一个大头宽脸，眼睛小得和猪眼一般；还有一个鼻子特别大，好像把脸都占满了，头戴一顶圆锥形白帽，白帽上插一根细细的红公鸡尾羽。这些人都留着大胡子，胡子颜色不同，形状各异。有个人似乎是他们的首领。此人是个年老的绅士，身体结实，有一张饱经沧桑的脸，身穿镶着花边的紧身短上衣，腰扎宽皮带，佩一柄短剑，头戴高帽，帽插羽翎，脚上穿着红袜子和系着玫瑰结的高跟鞋。这些人使瑞普想起了村里牧师多米尼·凡·夏克家客厅里挂的一幅佛兰德斯(5)油画，那幅画是荷兰人定居此地时从荷兰带来的。

尤其让瑞普感到奇怪的是：这些人明明是在娱乐，表情却极为凝重，神秘兮兮地一声不吭，这可是他所见过的最为沉闷的游戏了。四周静悄悄的，除了球滚动的声音之外，再无其他声音了。那些球滚动起来，山间便会响起隆隆的回声，似一阵阵的响雷。

瑞普和同路人走近时，他们突然停下球戏，凝神望着他，似一尊尊雕像，表情古怪、粗鲁而呆滞，叫他心里发毛、双腿发软。同路人将桶里的酒倒进几个大酒壶里，招手叫他过去给打球者上酒。瑞普吓得浑身发抖，依命而行。打球人一声不响，把酒一饮而尽，又继续玩他们的游戏了。

瑞普的畏惧不安渐渐消退了。趁着无人注意，他壮起胆来把那酒尝了一口，觉得味道很像上等的荷兰杜松子酒。他生性嗜酒，没一会儿又忍不住尝了一口。一口接着一口地喝，他频频举起酒壶，最后喝得神志模糊、头昏眼花，脑袋逐渐耷拉下来，昏沉沉酣然大睡。

一觉醒来，他发现自己仍躺在那个长满野草的绿色小土墩上（他起初就是从此处看到山谷里的那位老者的）。他揉揉眼睛——面前是一个阳光明媚的早晨，树丛中鸟儿在歌唱、跳跃，一只老鹰驾着山间清新的微风盘旋在高空。瑞普心里嘀咕道：“我肯定不是一整夜都待在这儿睡大觉的。”随后，他想起了入睡前的一幕幕情景——那个扛着一桶酒的陌生人……那山谷……荒山野岭里的那个隐秘去处……那几个玩九柱戏的哭丧着脸的人……那个酒壶……“对啦！就是那壶酒作的怪！那壶可恶的酒误了大事！”瑞普心里翻江倒海。“我怎么向凡·温克太太交代才好呢？”他环顾四周找他的枪，却发现原来那杆油光铮亮的鸟枪不见了，身边只有一杆破破烂烂的旧枪，枪筒上锈迹斑斑，枪栓脱落，枪托上满是虫蛀的小孔。他怀疑是山间那几个阴沉着脸玩游戏的家伙捉弄了他，用酒把他灌醉，偷走了他的枪。“狼”也不见了，可能是跑去追松鼠或者山鹑了。他吹口哨唤它，高声叫它的名字，但无济于事。他的口哨声和叫喊声四处回荡，然而狗却踪影全无。

他决计回到昨天傍晚的游戏现场去，遇到那帮子人，就让他们归还他的狗和枪。站起身走路时，却发现关节僵硬，没有平时那么灵活了。“这一定是在这大山的地上睡觉睡的，”他心想，“要是这么胡折腾，万一得了风湿病起不了床，凡·温克太太可就会给我好脸色看了。”他颇为费力地走下山谷，找到昨天傍晚他和那位老者曾经走过的那条干涸的溪沟。而眼前的景象却叫他吃了一惊——但见一条山涧正水沫飞溅地在溪谷里流淌，削岩击石，哗哗的流水声响彻了山谷。他急忙另外择道爬上山腰，艰难地穿过由桦树、檫树和金缕梅构成的杂树丛。野葡萄的藤蔓在树丛里左缠右绕，织成网阻住去路，时而将他绊倒，时而缠住他的脚。

最后，他顺着溪谷走到了悬崖跟前，那儿原先有裂口可以通向那个圆形剧场，而现在裂口不见了，一点痕迹都没有留下。石崖形成了一道高不可攀的墙壁，一股激流飞下石崖，泛着泡沫，似一张倒挂的水帘，滔滔的流水跌入一个宽宽的深水潭，周围的树木投下的阴影将那儿遮掩得光线暗淡。走到这里，可怜的瑞普只好收住了脚步。他再一次吹口哨，大声叫喊，呼唤他的狗。然而，作答的只有呱呱呱几声乌鸦的鸣叫——但见阳光普照的悬崖顶上有一株枯树，枯树上有一群乌鸦在飞来飞去地悠闲嬉戏。乌鸦们高高在上、无忧无虑，似乎在居高临下地望着这个身处困境的可怜人，对他嗤之以鼻。这下子该如何是好？早晨的时光在悄然流逝，瑞普饥肠辘辘，迫切地想吃早餐。他心情沉重，对他的狗和枪已不再抱有指望。他害怕见到妻子，但是饿死在山里总归不是办法。末了，他摇摇头，扛着那杆锈迹斑斑的旧枪，怀着满腹的心事和忧虑，踏上了返家的路程。

走近村子，沿路遇见了一些人，他却一个都不认识，这就叫他感到奇怪了，因为周围一带他自以为没有他不认识的人。那些人所穿的衣服，在样式上跟他熟悉的大不一样。他们痴呆呆望着他，脸上也同样露出惊讶的表情，而且每当把目光落在他身上，总要摸摸自己的下巴。见他们一再做出这个动作，瑞普不知不觉也跟着做了一下，这一摸可把他吓了一跳——他发现自己的胡子长得足足有一英尺长了！

到了村头，一群不认识的小孩跟在他屁股后边跑，冲他大喊大叫，对着他的花白胡子指指点点。村里的狗也没有一条是他认识的，他走过时冲着他狂吠乱叫。就连村子也变了样，变得比以前更大了，人也更多了。那一排排的房屋他见都没有见过，而他常去的那些熟悉的人家不见了踪影。如今，那些房屋的门首写的净是陌生的名字，窗口露出的净是陌生的面孔——所有的一切都是那么陌生。他心里感到很不安，开始怀疑他自己以及周围这个世界都中了魔法。此处明明是他土生土长的村子，才离开了一天就变了样。卡茨基尔群山仍巍然耸立在那儿……银色的哈德逊河仍在远处流淌……丘陵、沟壑仍和从前一模一样……瑞普一头雾水，心里感到迷茫……“昨天晚上的那壶酒有问题，”他心想，“喝了那酒，我的脑子才变糊涂的！”

他费了一番气力才找到了回自家的路，走近家门时蹑手蹑脚的，心里怕得要命，生怕会听见凡·温克太太那刺耳的尖叫声。他发现自己家的房屋已破败不堪——屋顶塌陷，窗户破碎，房门和铰链两分离。一条饿得半死的狗，样子很像“狼”，在房屋周围转来转去。他唤它的名字，而那畜生竟然冲他咆哮，龇着牙齿，后来理也没理他便跑开了。简直是一个忘恩负义的家伙！“这可是我自己的狗呀，就连它都把我给忘了！”可怜的瑞普叹了口气说。

他举步走进了屋子。说实话，凡·温克太太总是把这里收拾得井井有条的，而现在此处空空荡荡、冷冷清清，没有了人气。凄凉的场景压倒了他对老婆的畏惧，于是他大声喊老婆和孩子的名字。他的声音在冷清的房间里回荡，片刻之后周围又恢复了沉寂。他慌了神，抽身走开，匆匆忙忙赶往他常去的休闲地——村子里的那家客栈。客栈不见了，取而代之的是一幢快要散架的木头大房子，几扇硕大的窗户敞开着，有的玻璃碎了，用旧帽子和旧裙子堵住缺口。大房子的门首有几个大字：“乔纳森·杜利特尔联合旅馆”。昔日的那个宁静的荷兰小客栈门前有棵大树遮阴，而今大树也不见了踪影，被一根光秃秃的高柱子取代，柱顶上有个好像是红色睡帽的东西，那儿挂着一面随风飘扬的旗子，旗子上有些星星和条纹奇怪地组合在一起——所有的一切都是那么离奇古怪、匪夷所思。不过，他从招牌上总算还认出了国王乔治的那张红润的脸——他曾经多次在招牌下方安安静静地吸烟斗。然而，就连这幅画像也发生了奇异的变化——红色上衣换成了一件蓝黄色相间的上衣，手里的权杖换成了一把宝剑，头戴一顶三角帽，画像下面用大号字体写着：“华盛顿将军”。

门口跟往常一样聚集着一群人，不过没有一个是瑞普能记得起来的熟人。这些人就连性情好像都变了，不像从前那样悠闲、安静、不冷不热的，而是急躁、吵吵闹闹的，喜欢打口水仗。他想找那位宽脸膛、双下巴、不喜欢闲谈，而总是衔着根漂亮的长烟斗吞云吐雾的智者尼古拉斯·维德尔，还想找那位慢吞吞给大家读旧报纸的乡村教师凡·布麦尔，却都没有找到。他倒是看到了一个瘦瘦的、看上去脾气很坏的家伙，口袋里塞满了传单，正在高谈阔论什么公民权啦，选举啦，国会议员啦，自由啦，邦克山战役(6)啦，1776年的英雄(7)啦，还有其他的一些论调，全都是生僻难懂的词，让凡 ·温克越听越糊涂。

瑞普的出现，还有他那花白的长胡子、锈迹斑斑的鸟枪、怪异的衣着，后面还跟着一大群女人和孩子，立刻引起了旅馆前那些政客的注意。他们将他围在中间，充满好奇地上下打量着他。那位演说家挤上前来，把他拉到一边，问他投哪一方的选票。瑞普不知所云，茫然地望着对方。另有一个爱管闲事的小个子拽住他的胳膊，踮起脚尖，凑到他耳边问：“你是联邦党(8)还是民主党？”瑞普对这个问题同样大惑不解。这时候，一个头戴尖顶三角帽、自作聪明又自命不凡的老绅士，用胳膊肘把大家向左右推开，从人群中挤了过来，在凡·温克面前站定，一只手叉腰，另一只手拄着手杖，目光之锐利和帽顶之尖，似乎能刺穿瑞普的灵魂。他厉声喝问道：“正值选举之际，他扛着枪，身后跟着一群人，意在何为？是不是想在村子里制造骚乱？”

“天哪！先生们，”瑞普有点慌了神，大声叫屈，“我可是个本分的可怜人，是这儿土生土长的人，是国王的忠实臣民。愿上帝保佑国王！”

一听这话，看热闹的人群爆发出一片叫喊声：“亲英分子！亲英分子！奸细！逃亡者！把他轰出去！叫他滚蛋！”

那个头戴三角帽、自命不凡的人费了好大的力气才恢复了秩序，然后皱起眉头做出比原来严厉十倍的样子，再次盘问这个来路不明的犯罪嫌疑人，喝问他到此有何目的，想找什么人。可怜的瑞普低声下气地保证自己没有恶意，只不过是到这儿来找几个常来客栈聊天的邻居。

“是吗？他们是谁？你说说他们的名字？”

瑞普稍微想了想，然后问道：“尼古拉斯·维德尔在哪儿？”

现场一片沉寂。过了一会儿才有一位老者用尖细的声音回答道：“尼古拉斯·维德尔吗？嗨，他早死了，死了有十八年了！教堂的墓地里原来有块木头墓碑，刻着他的生卒年月什么的，后来烂掉了，不见了。”

“布鲁姆·达契尔在哪儿呢？”

“哦，战争一开始他就参军去了。有人说他在斯东尼角的战役中阵亡了……还有人说他在安东尼悬崖的脚下遇到风暴淹死了。具体情况我不清楚……反正他一去再没有回来。”

“教师凡·布麦尔在哪儿呢？”

“他也打仗去了，成了民军的大将军，眼下在国会里当议员呢。”

听见家乡和朋友们发生了如此可悲的变化，发现自己成了孤零零一个人被遗弃在这个世界上，瑞普的一颗心都碎了。这些人的回答涉及的时间跨度极大，包含的内容令他无法理解，每一句都叫他摸不着头脑。什么战争啦，国会啦，斯东尼角啦，叫他不知所云。他没有勇气再问其他朋友的下落，于绝望之中高喊了一声：“难道这儿就没有一个人认识瑞普·凡·温克吗？”

“嗨，你说瑞普·凡·温克吗？”有两三个人叫了起来，“当然认识喽！那边那个靠着树的就是瑞普·凡·温克！”

瑞普朝那边望去，看见了一个和自己上山那时候长得一模一样的人——样子也是那么懒懒散散，穿得也是那么破破烂烂。这下子，他彻底糊涂了。他甚至对自己产生了怀疑，弄不清自己是什么人了。正当他心里一片迷乱的时候，那个戴三角帽的家伙再次发难，喝问他是什么人，叫什么名字。

“苍天在上！”他不知所措地喊了一声，“我已经不是我自己了……我成了另外一个人了……那边那个人才是我……不……那是另一个人，变成了我的模样。昨天晚上我还是我自己来着，在山上睡了一觉，他们偷换了我的枪，所有的一切都变了样，连我也变成了另外一个人，说不出自己的名字，说不出自己是什么人！”

旁观的人群你看看我，我看看你，有的点头，有的意味深长地眨巴眼睛，有的则用手指轻敲自己的脑门。也有人压低声音建议夺下这个老家伙的枪，免得他开枪伤人。一听这话，那个头戴三角帽、自命不凡的人急忙开溜，生怕伤了自己。

就在这紧急关头，一个年轻漂亮的女子分开人群挤了过来，想仔细瞧瞧这个白胡子老头。她怀里抱着一个胖乎乎的孩子，那孩子一见瑞普的模样就吓着了，哇哇大哭起来。“别哭，瑞普，”女子叫道，“别哭，你这小傻瓜；这个老头不会伤害你的。”

孩子的名字、母亲的神态以及她说话的腔调，这一切在瑞普的心里唤醒了一连串的回忆。

“你叫什么名字，我的好太太？”他问道。

“朱迪丝·加迪尼耶。”

“你父亲叫什么名字？”

“唉，我可怜的父亲叫瑞普·凡·温克。二十年前他扛着枪离开家门，从那以后再也没有了音讯……他的狗自己跑了回来。谁也说不清他到底是开枪自杀了，还是被印第安人抓走了。事发时，我还是个小孩呢。”

现在只剩下一件事需要问了，而瑞普在问的时候连声音都发抖了：“你母亲在哪儿呢？”

“哦，她不久前也死了，是跟一个新英格兰小贩发脾气，血管破裂死的。”

这个消息最起码叫老实巴交的瑞普稍放宽了一些心。他再也无法控制自己，一把将女儿和那孩子拥在了怀里。“我是你爸爸！”他叫道，“离开你时，我是年轻的瑞普·凡·温克，现在成了老瑞普·凡·温克了！难道就没有一个人认识可怜的瑞普·凡·温克吗？”

大家站在那里惊呆了，后来有一个老太婆从人群中颤颤巍巍地走出来，用手遮在额头上，凝神打量一阵他的脸，随即叫喊起来：“没错！真是瑞普·凡·温克……真是他！欢迎你回家，老邻居。这二十年来，你跑到哪儿去了？”

瑞普三言两语就把自己的经历讲完了，因为二十年的时间对他来说只是短短的一个夜晚。邻人们听得目瞪口呆，有的则挤眉弄眼，有的吐舌头扮鬼脸。刚才的那场虚惊过后，那个头戴三角帽、自命不凡的人又回到了现场，此时噘噘嘴、摇摇头，而人群中其他的人也跟着摇起头来。

此时，只见彼得·凡德敦克老人从大路上慢慢腾腾走了过来，大家决定听听他的看法。他是一位跟他同名同姓的历史学家的后裔。那位历史学家编写过这个省最早的历史书。彼得是村子里最老的住户，对本地区的奇闻异事以及风土人情了如指掌。他立刻回想起了瑞普，以极其坚定的态度确认瑞普的讲述真实可信。他向大家保证确有其事，声称他的那个历史学家的祖先曾经留下过记载，说卡茨基尔山经常有奇怪的人出没。他还肯定地说：最初是伟大的亨德利克·哈德逊发现了这条大河以及这片地区，以后每隔二十年便率领着他那条“半月号”轮船上的水手来此地巡游一圈，以这种方式重访他建立功业的地方，观察观察以他的名字命名的河流和伟大城市。他说自己的父亲就曾亲眼看见他们身穿古代的荷兰服装在一个山坳里玩九柱戏，而他本人在一个夏日的下午也听到过他们打球的声音，那隆隆的声音像远方一阵阵的响雷。

长话短说。末了，人群散去，又回去忙更重要的选举事务了。瑞普的女儿携父归家，和她住在一起。她有一幢环境舒适、设施齐全的房屋，还有一个体格健壮、生性乐观的农夫丈夫。瑞普回想了一下，认出这个女婿就是当初经常爬到他背上玩的顽童当中的一个。至于瑞普的儿子（即他的继承人），也就是那个跟他长得一模一样、依树而站的人，靠给别人在田里当雇工过活；儿子显然继承了他的秉性，热衷于帮别人干活，对自家的事务却不闻不问。

如今，瑞普又恢复了过去的习惯，经常四处游逛。没多久，他就找到了许多以前的老友，但老友们由于时光的磨蚀，状态大不如从前。他倒喜欢跟年轻的一代交朋友，不久便在年轻的一代中深得人心了。

他在家无所事事，反正已到了享清福的年龄，就是什么也不干，也不会受到责难的。于是，他又重新坐到了旅馆门口的长凳子上，被村里人尊为元老、“战前”旧时代的一部活字典。过了一段时间，他才跟上了趟，听得懂大家唠嗑时说的话了，或者说明白了自打他昏睡过去之后国内发生的那些离奇古怪的事件——这期间发生了一场革命战争……这个国家已经摆脱了英国的奴役……他已经不是乔治三世陛下的臣民，而是美利坚合众国的一个自由公民了。其实，他并不关心政治，帝国变成合众国对他来说没有多大的影响；让他长期受尽压迫的只有一种专制——老婆的专横跋扈。幸好这种现象已不复存在。他苦尽甘来，终于摆脱了婚姻的枷锁，如今不管什么时候愿意回家就回家，愿意出门就出门，不用再害怕凡·温克太太的暴政了。不过，一提起老婆的名字，他依然会耸耸肩、摇摇头、两眼看天。这种神态可以被解读为对命运的屈服，也可以被视为获得解放后的喜悦。

遇见外乡人来杜利特尔联合旅馆住宿，他就把自己的经历讲给人家听。起初，人们注意到他每次讲的内容在一些细节上都不相同，无疑是因为刚刚醒来的缘故。后来，他的讲述才最终统一成一个版本，跟我此处记载的完全一样了。邻里间的男女老少对他的故事均能倒背如流。

有些人假装怀疑故事的真实性，硬说那是瑞普臆想出来的，而瑞普对此不置可否。不过，老一代荷兰裔居民对他的讲述几乎全都深信不疑。甚至时至今日，夏季的某个下午听见卡茨基尔山那儿传来雷声，他们总会说那是亨德利克·哈德逊和他的水手们在玩九柱戏。附近一带，“妻管严”丈夫们一旦觉得生活过于沉重，便寄希望于瑞普·凡·温克的酒壶，盼望从他的酒壶里喝上一口“排忧解愁酒”。

有人可能会怀疑尼克博克先生以上的故事一定是受到了德国的一段迷信故事的影响——该迷信故事讲的是腓特烈·德·罗特巴特皇帝和吉普豪瑟山之间的传说。可是，故事后附加的注释会表明此讲述非杜撰，而是事实，以他一贯的忠实风格秉笔直书……

“也许很多人会觉得瑞普·凡·温克的故事是天方夜谭，然而我却笃信无疑，因为我了解古老的荷兰定居点那一带的情况，知道那儿很可能会发生离奇古怪的非凡事件。实际上，在哈德逊河沿岸的村庄里，我听到的许多故事比这还离奇，全都有鼻子有眼，不容你怀疑。我甚至还和瑞普·凡·温克本人交谈过，发现他是一个非常令人尊敬的老人，说话极有条理，表达观点前后连贯，凡是有头脑的人恐怕绝不会怀疑他的话有疑点。不仅如此，我还在一家地区法院里看到过关于此事的证词，上面有法官的亲笔交叉签名。

附笔


以下旅行笔记摘自于尼克博克先生的备忘录：

卡茨博格山（或称卡茨基尔山）历来都是传奇故事的摇篮。印第安人将其视为精灵的家园——那些精灵呼风唤雨，洒阳光、驱云团，决定着狩猎的淡季和旺季。精灵们领命于一个年老的母精灵，据说这个老精灵是他们的母亲。母精灵居住在卡茨基尔山最高的山峰上，经管日与夜的门户，在合适的时间开和闭。她将新月挂上天空，把旧月砍碎，形成诸多星辰。在干旱少雨的季节，她如果心情好，就会用蜘蛛网和晨露编织轻盈的雨云，站在高山之巅将雨云撒下去，那雨云一片片纷飞，在空中飘荡，似棉絮一般。后来，温暖的阳光把雨云融化，化为细雨落下，使草木旺盛、水果挂枝头，使得庄稼节节长高。不过，她要是心情不好，就会编织出墨一般黑的雨云，自己坐在当间，犹如一个大肚子蜘蛛隐身于蛛网里。一旦乌黑的雨云破开，下边的山川沟壑就会遭受水患！

根据印第安人的传说，很久以前有一种山神（或称山精）出没于卡茨基尔山的荒林野岭。他们喜欢恶作剧，想出各种馊点子，给印第安人带来无尽的烦恼。他们有时候会化作熊、豹或鹿，以迷惑猎手，引着猎手深入密林，攀上险山，使得他们疲于奔命，最后突然纵身一跳，消失不见，让猎手止步于万丈悬崖边缘或滔滔山涧跟前，吓出一身冷汗。

山神的居住地至今仍看得见——其实是一块岩石（或者说是一处崖壁），位于人迹罕至的大山深处，周围荒藤缠绕，野花遍地开放，名叫“花园岩”。 靠近它的脚下是一个小湖，那儿是孤单的鸬鹚栖息之地，湖面上漂着睡莲，水蛇躺在莲叶上晒太阳。对于这个地方，印第安人素有敬畏之心，就连胆子最大的猎手也不敢在附近追逐猎物。从前，有个猎手因迷路来到了“花园岩”，看见树杈上挂着几个葫芦，便顺手拿走了一个，后来慌不择路，葫芦掉在了石头上，里面涌出滔滔洪水，将他冲下悬崖，摔了个粉身碎骨。而那股水滚滚流向哈德逊河，至今仍流淌不息，即世人所熟知的“卡特斯夺命河”。

鬼新郎


——一个旅行家的故事(1)

昨晚为他设宴，今夜他却尸体冰凉！

昨天领他进卧房，今夜钢刀做他的床！

——艾格尔爵士、格雷厄姆爵士、格雷·斯蒂尔爵士

在德国南部有一片高地叫奥登瓦德，距美因河与莱茵河交汇处不远，虽然是荒蛮之乡，却充满了浪漫气息。许多许多年之前，在其中的一座高丘上矗立着冯·兰德肖特男爵的城堡。如今，城堡已变成了残垣断壁，几乎完全隐没于山毛榉和黑黝黝的冷杉树那茫茫的林海里了。不过，那座古老的瞭望塔仍屹立不倒，跟我刚刚提到的城堡以前的主人一样，挣扎着把头抬得高高的，俯瞰着周围的景色。

这位男爵属于卡特赞尼兰博根大家族的一个日渐凋零的分支。(2)他继承了祖上的遗产，也继承了他们傲岸的性格。尽管先人们生性好战，大大损耗了家族产业，但男爵却气势依旧，竭力维持着家族昔日的排场。那时天下太平，德国贵族一般都抛弃了他们那像鹰巢一样高踞于群山中的生活不便的古堡，而在山谷里建造起比较方便的住宅。然而这位男爵却仍然高傲地固守着他小小的堡垒，以祖上遗传给他的顽固天性牢记着前辈高祖父一代结下的冤仇，所以和近旁的邻居们关系紧张。

男爵只有一个孩子，是个女儿。大凡独苗，老天多有恩赐，总会赐予奇异的禀赋作为补偿，男爵的这个掌上明珠亦是如此。所有的保姆、妇人、乡下的亲戚，无不在男爵面前夸她，说她的美貌在全德国无人可比。的确，这些人的夸赞所言不虚。另外，她自小就受到两位姑妈的精心监护，而这两位姑妈终生未嫁，早年曾在德国一个小宫廷里生活过几年，精通教育大家闺秀所必需的各门知识。在两位姑妈的谆谆教诲下，她成了一个多才多艺的奇才。她十八岁时，刺绣技艺令人叹为观止，曾在绣帘上绣出了全套的圣徒事迹，绣品上的人物表情逼真，一个个看上去活似炼狱里受难的鬼魂。在阅读方面，她也没有费多大气力，靠着自己拼读看完了好几种教会传说以及《启示录》里几乎所有骑士的传奇经历。她甚至写字也写得相当熟练，签名时能够做到一个字母也不遗漏，而且清晰可辨，让两个姑妈不戴眼镜也能看得清楚。她心灵手巧，善于制作各种各样雅致的小摆设，虽没有实际用途，却也可愉悦心性。除此之外，她还能歌善舞，精通当时流行的最为深奥的舞蹈，可以用竖琴和吉他弹奏出许多曲子，对于《歌谣集》里的那些柔情小调亦能够做到吟唱自如。

两个姑妈年轻时在风月场上善于打情骂俏，而今担负监护侄女的重任，摇身一变成了敏锐的保护人和严格的监督者，履行职责一丝不苟——若论当少女的监护人，恐怕没有谁比人老色衰的卖俏女更为严格谨慎、刻薄无情了。她们极少让侄女走出她们的视野，侄女一旦走出城堡的范围，必有人陪伴，或者说必有人严密监视。她们孜孜不倦地向她施教，要求她严守礼节和绝对服从。至于对那些臭男人——呸！她们要求侄女跟男人要保持很远的距离，绝对不要相信他们，除非获得允许，否则就是遇见天下最英俊的骑士，也不能看他一眼——即便他死在她的脚下，也不许看他。

这种教育模式收效很好，有目共睹。这位千金小姐成了性格温顺、举止端庄的典范。别的女孩子在这个浮华的世界里空空耗费灿烂的年华，如野花被人采摘又随手扔掉，而她却在两个追求完美的老处女的呵护之下，羞答答地长成了一个娇艳可爱的花季少女，就像一朵玫瑰花蕾在保护它的那些棘刺丛中含苞欲放。姑妈们看着她，眼里充满了自豪和喜悦，夸口说即便全世界的女孩子都走上邪路，谢天谢地，这种事情也绝不会发生在卡特赞尼兰博根家族这个女继承人身上。

不过，不管冯·兰德肖特男爵是多么缺儿少女，他的这个家族的人数却不少，老天倒是赐给了他一大群穷亲戚。他们一个个全都具有贫微的亲戚那种重感情的通病，如胶似漆地爱着男爵，一有机会就蜂拥而至，给城堡带来一片生气。每逢家族庆典日，这些好心人都要来欢聚一堂，一切开销均由男爵承担。酒足饭饱后，他们会宣称，天下没有比家族盛典举家欢乐更叫人高兴的事了。

男爵虽身材矮小，心地却很宽广，一想到自己是这块小天地里最显赫的人物，一颗心便满足得膨胀起来。古堡的墙上挂着一些武士的画像，威严地俯视着下方，而男爵特别喜欢讲他们的故事，那些故事冗长冗长的。他发现听他讲故事，谁都不如前来混吃喝的穷亲戚有耐心。他对传奇故事情有独钟，对那些流传于德国每一座山、每一条谷的奇闻异事笃信不疑。来古堡的食客们甚至比他更相信那些传说，听他讲述时，每次都会瞪大眼睛、张大嘴巴，即使听一百遍，也总是会露出惊讶的神情。冯·兰德肖特男爵就是这样过日子的——他是古堡饭桌旁的圣贤、自家小王朝里至高无上的君主，而叫他最有幸福感的是，他自认为是当代最有智慧的人。

在本故事开始的时候，城堡里聚集了一大群族人，因为有一件极其重大的事情就要发生——迎接将要娶男爵女儿为妻的新郎。双方的家长（男方的家长是巴伐利亚的一位旧贵族）经过协商，要通过儿女的婚事将两个尊贵的家族联合起来。前期的准备工作已经按部就班进行完毕。两位年轻人彼此并未见面，却已定下了婚约，举行婚礼的日期业已敲定。为了这桩婚事，年轻的冯·阿尔滕伯格伯爵被从军队里叫了回来，实际上他现在已在迎亲途中，前来男爵府迎娶新娘。他从乌兹堡写来一封信，说他的行程因事有所耽搁，信中写明了他预期抵达男爵府的日子和时辰。

古堡里一片忙乱，准备热烈迎接新郎官。美丽的新娘被精心打扮了起来。她的梳妆打扮都是在姑妈们的监督之下完成的，两个姑妈对她的衣着每一个细节都各持己见，争吵了整整一个上午。年轻的男爵小姐利用她们争执不休的机会，按照自己的品位打扮，产生了很好的效果。她看上去妩媚可爱，一定能叫年轻的新郎官一见钟情，由于怀着期待的心情，她面色更加娇艳。

她的脸和脖子罩上了一片红晕，胸脯轻轻地一起一伏，眼里不时闪烁着梦想的光芒，这一切都暴露出她的心里在发生着温柔的波动。姑妈们围着她打转——大凡终身未嫁的姑妈对这类事情往往都兴趣盎然。至于该有怎样的言谈举止，该以什么样的方式接待意中人，她们给她提了一大堆老成的忠告。

男爵也一样忙得不亦乐乎。实际上，并没有什么具体的事情需要他做，但这个小个子男人是个急性子，干事雷厉风行，当周围的人都在忙碌不停的时候，他不可能袖手旁观。他带着万分焦急的神情在城堡里跑上跑下，四处生乱，时不时会教训几句正在干活的仆人，让他们不要偷懒。他的嚷嚷声回荡在各个大厅和房间里，嗡嗡嗡的，像炎热夏日的一只绿头苍蝇，焦躁不安、喋喋不休。

与此同时，养肥了的小牛犊已宰杀完毕；森林里人声鼎沸，猎人们狩猎的吆喝声此起彼伏；厨房里堆满了各种美味佳肴；大量的莱茵酒和费雷酒从地窖里搬了出来，甚至动用了海德堡大酒桶(3)。万事俱备，只等着隆重迎接尊贵的客人，展示德国人热情好客的精神面貌了，可是客人却迟迟不见露面。一个小时又一个小时悄然流逝。原本倾洒在奥登瓦德森林上的阳光渐渐隐去，最后仅在群山之巅闪烁着光芒。男爵爬上最高的一座瞭望塔，望眼欲穿地向远方眺望，希望能看见伯爵和他的随从的身影。有一次，他觉得自己好像看见了他们，仿佛听见号角声从山谷里飘来，在山间激起一串串回音。果真有几个骑马人从远处沿着大道慢慢地走了过来，可是就在他们眼看要抵达山脚时，却突然转了方向。最后的一抹夕阳消失了，蝙蝠开始在暮色里飞来飞去，大道变得越来越模糊，那儿什么动静也看不见，只时不时见几个农夫慢慢吞吞地从田间归来。

兰德肖特家的古堡里一片茫然，人们不知所措。而就在这时，奥登瓦德的另一个地方却出现了一幅非常有趣的场景。冯·阿尔滕伯格伯爵正安安静静地行走在路上，坐骑迈着碎步，不慌不忙。这位新郎官安然若素，去迎娶新娘——反正所有的麻烦事以及扑朔迷离的求婚过程均由别人代劳，新娘和婚宴就在前方等着他，这些都是板上钉钉的事。走到乌兹堡时，他遇见了一个年轻的战友。二人曾在边疆一起服过兵役。这个战友名叫赫尔曼·冯·斯塔肯浮士德，是一个作战极为勇敢、心灵极为高尚的德国骑士，此时正从军中返回家里。他家的城堡距离兰德肖特家的古堡并不远，不过由于家族世仇，两家人一直相互敌视、形同路人。

两位年轻的朋友见面分外亲热，各叙衷曲，把各自经历的事情和命运讲给对方听。伯爵说他要去跟一个姑娘完婚——那姑娘他从没见过，但听人说有沉鱼落雁的容貌，这叫他喜不自禁。

鉴于两位朋友走的是同一方向，他们决定余下的路程结伴而行，打算早一点从乌兹堡动身，路上可以舒服一些。伯爵吩咐他的侍从随后赶来。

途中，他们回忆着军旅生活和冒险经历作为消遣，以解除旅途的烦闷。另外，伯爵老是不厌其烦地提到自己的新娘，说她美貌传播四方，幸福正在等待着他。

说着话，他们走进了奥登瓦德的荒山野岭，这儿的荒径行人绝迹，林深树密。德国的森林里土匪出没，城堡中闹鬼，这已成了广为人知的现象。而此时此地，散兵游勇成群结队，干起打家劫舍的勾当，数量多如牛毛。所以，两位朋友在密林中遇到一群散兵的袭击，也就不足为怪了。他们奋勇抵抗，但寡不敌众，眼看招架不住，幸好伯爵的侍从及时赶来助战。土匪们见了一哄而散。而此时伯爵已负致命重伤。大家轻手轻脚、小心翼翼地把他送回了乌兹堡，并从附近的修道院里请来一位修士，此人因善于医治精神和肉体的疾病而小有名气。可是面对致命重伤，他回天乏术，伯爵生命垂危，所剩的时间屈指可数。

伯爵临咽气之前，恳求他的朋友立刻赶往兰德肖特家的古堡，就说他身受致命之伤，无法如约和新娘完婚了。他虽然算不上一个感情极为炽热的恋人，却是一个极为讲究礼节的君子，似乎焦虑万分，只希望能把消息迅速送到，做到有礼有节。“除非能了结此事，否则我将死不瞑目。”他以非常凝重的口吻留下了这句遗言。值此生命存亡时刻提出的请求容不得犹豫，斯塔肯浮士德好言劝他静养，言辞诚恳地许诺一定完成他的心愿，并伸出手来庄严地对他发誓。气息奄奄的伯爵紧握他的手表示感谢，接着神志很快陷入了昏迷之中，口里说着胡话，念叨着他的新娘、婚约和誓言，还吩咐给他备马，说他要到兰德肖特家的古堡去，而就在他幻想着自己飞身上马的过程中咽了气。

斯塔肯浮士德面对战友突遭的厄运长长叹了口气，洒下了几滴英雄泪，随即便考虑起怎样去完成自己所承担的难堪的使命。他心情沉重，脑子里一片混乱，因为他要到仇人家去做不速之客，还要给对方带去噩耗，毁掉他们的希望，给他们的喜事泼上一盆冷水。不过，他的内心悄然产生了一丝好奇，想去看看那个在严密监护下与世隔绝，却又远近闻名的卡特赞尼兰博根家的美女。他对漂亮女性历来有强烈的倾慕之心，又生性不拘一格、勇于探索，使得他喜欢一切奇异的冒险行动。

临行之前，他和修道院的修士们一起做出了妥当的安排，要为他的朋友举行隆重的葬礼；他的战友将被安葬于乌兹堡大教堂，跟他的几位显赫亲戚的墓地相距不远，伯爵的那些悲恸欲绝的侍从负责运送主人的遗体。

话说到这里，又该讲讲古老的卡特赞尼兰博根家族那儿的情况了。他们焦急地期待着客人的到来，而盼望酒宴的心情更为急切。刚才说到可敬的小个子男爵在瞭望塔翘首以待，现在应该再讲讲他的状况。

夜色四合，而客人踪影全无。男爵于绝望之中走下了瞭望塔。酒宴一推再推，几个小时已经过去了，不能再耽搁了。肉已经烤过了头，弄得厨师忧心忡忡，全家上下就像一支因为饥饿而丧失了战斗力的守护城堡的驻军。无奈之下，男爵只好下令开饭，不再等客人了。大家在餐桌旁落座，正准备开吃，却听见大门外传来了号角声，报告有客人登门。接着又是一声长长的号角，久久回荡在古堡的庭院里，而城墙上的卫兵鸣号回应。男爵忙不迭跑去迎接未来的女婿。

吊桥放下，客人已走到大门前。来者是个威武的骑士，高高的个头，骑一匹黑色骏马。他面色苍白，眼睛却炯炯有神、风流多情，神态庄重而忧郁。男爵见他单人单骑，未带侍从，心里难免有些不快。这是一个重要的场合，来者将与一个显赫的家族联姻，然而他却缺乏起码的尊重，这叫男爵的自尊心一时受到了挫伤。不过他又让自己冷静下来，觉得一定是年轻人太性急，把侍从甩在后边，自己先一步到达了。

“对不起，”来客说道，“冒昧前来，多有打扰……”

没等他说完，男爵就打断了他的话，说出了一大堆恭维和寒暄的话语（说实在的，他对自己的礼节和口才颇感自豪）。来客尝试了一两次，想打断那滔滔不绝的话语，然而仅是徒劳，只好鞠了一躬，听任男爵讲下去。待男爵停住话头时，他们已到了城堡的内院。来客正准备说话，却又一次被打断了——只见几个女眷领着羞羞答答、满脸通红的新娘走了过来。他望着新娘，一时都看呆了，似乎整个灵魂都焕发出精神，痴痴望着那个可爱的人儿。一个老处女姑妈附在新娘的耳旁低语几声，新娘便怯生生抬起她那水汪汪的蓝眼睛，害羞地望一眼来客算作问候，随即又低下了头，眼睛看着地面。她没有说话，但唇边闪出一丝甜蜜的微笑，脸颊上露出柔情的酒窝，表明方才那一眼是满意的表示。一个十八岁的大姑娘，花一样的年龄，渴望着爱情和婚姻，不可能不喜欢一个如此英武的骑士。

客人姗姗来迟，此时已没有时间多谈。男爵素来独断专行，吩咐有话明天再说，随即便引着客人向尚未品尝的酒宴走去。

酒宴安排在城堡的大厅里。这儿四周的墙上悬挂着卡特赞尼兰博根家族那些英雄先辈面貌严厉的肖像，还有他们从战场和猎场上斩获的战利品。被砍破的盔甲、折断了的比武用的长矛以及破碎的旗帜，这些东西和森林猎场上获取的猎物混杂在一起；野狼的颌骨和野猪的獠牙夹在弓弩和战斧当中，令人毛骨悚然地狞笑着；一对巨大的鹿角叉开来，悬挂在年轻来客的头顶正上方。

这位骑士很少留意同桌的人或者主人的款待，好酒好菜几乎尝也未尝，似乎只顾欣赏新娘了。他说话声音极低，旁人无法听得见——情话历来都是低声低语的。不过，女恋人的耳朵有哪个是迟钝的，哪能听不清情郎的窃窃私语！他含情脉脉，同时神情庄重，似乎对姑娘产生了强烈的影响。她侧耳静听，脸上时不时会泛起红晕，间或羞答答地回答上一两句话。当对方的目光移开时，她会偷偷地瞥一眼他那风流倜傥的面容，充满柔情和幸福地轻轻舒一口气。明摆着，这一对年轻人已彼此倾心。两位深谙心灵秘密的姑妈断言他们一见钟情，已坠入了爱河。

宴会欢快地进行着，或者至少可以说很热闹——来宾们由于平时缺少油水，又因为山里的空气好而胃口大开，个个都狼吞虎咽。男爵又讲起了故事，那故事非常棒、非常长，精彩程度超过以往，产生了震撼效应。说到奇闻异事，听众们会惊奇得目瞪口呆，而说到滑稽的事情，他们则会恰到好处地捧腹大笑。说实话，男爵就像大多数大人物那样，鉴于身份高贵，轻易不讲笑话，要讲也很乏味。不过，餐桌上斟一杯上等的霍克海默酒，再加上叫人心情愉悦的陈酒，即使是乏味的笑话，也会使人禁不住笑出声来的。有几个贫穷但伶俐的人倒是讲了许多有趣的故事，但除非换个类似的场合，此处是不便复述的；有人附在女眷的耳朵根悄声讲俏皮话，乐得女眷想笑不敢笑，憋得浑身颤抖；男爵有个堂兄，家境贫寒但生性快活，直着嗓子高唱了一两首歌，听得两个老处女姑妈急忙用扇子遮挡。

在一片狂欢的气氛中，那位陌生客人却始终表情严肃、不苟言笑，与周围的环境格格不入。夜色渐浓，他脸上的神情也越来越沮丧。说来也怪，甚至连男爵的笑话似乎也只能加深他的忧郁。有时候他心事重重、沉思默想，有时则焦虑不安、目光茫然，显得心情极不平静。他和新娘的交谈愈来愈热切，也愈来愈神秘。新娘那漂亮、宁静的脸上不知不觉罩上了一层愁云，一阵阵战栗传遍她那婀娜的身躯。

这情景没有逃过众人的眼睛。新郎官莫名其妙的郁郁寡欢给大家欢快的心情浇了一盆冷水。大家的情绪受到了感染。他们窃窃私语、交换眼色，同时耸耸肩膀，困惑地摇摇头。歌声和笑声越来越稀少，谈话中断，气氛尴尬。后来，男爵开始讲荒诞故事和离奇的传说，一个比一个凄惨。讲到一个幽灵骑士将美丽的利奥诺拉掳走这个故事时，几个女眷被吓得大呼小叫——这个惊悚故事被写进了诗篇，全世界的人都读过，也都信以为真。

新郎听男爵讲故事，听得十分专心， 眼睛一动不动地紧盯着男爵。故事接近尾声时，只见新郎慢慢地从座位上站起来，变得越来越高，男爵目光迷离，觉得他简直成了一个高塔一样的巨人。待故事一讲完，他深深地叹了口气，语气庄重地跟在座的人们告别。所有的人都惊呆了，男爵更是如遭雷劈。

“什么！半夜三更你要离开城堡？为了迎接你，一切都安排好了。你想休息，是有地方住宿的。”

新郎摇了摇头，表情哀痛、神秘，说道：“今天夜里我必须到另外一个地方去睡觉。”

他话中有话，语气叫男爵颇感不安，但男爵还是鼓起勇气，又把自己好意的恳求重复了一遍。

这位陌生的客人默默地又摇了摇头，不管怎么挽留都铁下心要走，末了挥手告别众人，迈着缓慢的步子走出了大厅。老处女姑妈一时呆若木雕石塑；新娘低下头，眼中悄然掉下了泪珠。

男爵跟随着这位陌生的客人走到城堡的大院里，那匹黑马正站在那儿用蹄子刨地，不耐烦地打着响鼻。二人走到桥门，那儿长长的拱廊里有一盏油灯在发着幽暗的光。陌生的客人留住脚步跟男爵说话，声音空洞，在拱廊里听上去像是来自阴曹地府。

“现在没别人在跟前，”他说道，“我不妨把离开的原因告诉你吧。我有一个庄严的、不能不履行的约会……”

“为什么就不能派个人代你赴约呢？”男爵说。

“此事不能叫人代替，我必须亲自去才行。我必须赶到乌兹堡大教堂去……”

“唉，”男爵打起精神说，“还是等明天再去吧……明天你带新娘一起去。”

“行不通！行不通！”陌生的客人，语气比刚才凝重了十倍，“我不能跟新娘结合，而要去见蛆虫！蛆虫在坟墓里等着我呢！我是一个死人……途中被土匪所杀……尸体放在乌兹堡……今夜下葬……坟墓在等着我……我不能爽约！”

说完，他翻身上马，冲过吊桥，嘚嘚的马蹄声渐渐消失在夜间呼啸的狂风里。

男爵几乎吓掉了魂，回到大厅里把刚才的情况讲了讲。两个女眷当场吓昏了过去。其他的人想到自己竟和一个鬼魂同桌吃饭，不禁感到恶心。有的人认为来者可能是德国传说中的大名鼎鼎的鬼魂猎手。有的则觉得是山妖、树精或者别的什么鬼怪精灵——从很久很久以前开始，善良的德国人就一直被这些魑魅魍魉搅得不得安宁。有个穷亲戚斗胆提出了一种猜测，说这也许是那位年轻骑士搞的金蝉脱壳之计，骑士那高深莫测、郁郁寡欢的样子以及他那阴沉的性格很能说明问题。但这一猜测立刻引发了众怒，尤其叫男爵怒不可遏，大家觉得这简直就是异教徒的异端邪说，吓得他慌不迭放弃了自己的邪说，又回到了虔诚的基督徒的正道上。

不过，不管人们心里有什么样的疑问，第二天都得了澄清。次日有正式的信函送来，证实了年轻的伯爵遇害的消息，说他的葬礼在乌兹堡大教堂举行。

城堡里的人惊愕不已，当时的情景可想而知。男爵一头钻进自己的寝室，闭门不出。客人们本来是要跟他同喜同庆的，此刻见他痛苦万分，不忍心丢下他离去。人们徘徊于院落里，或者三三五五聚集在大厅内，摇头、耸肩，为如此好的一个人遭遇不幸而惋惜。他们在餐桌旁坐的时间比先前更长，吃更多的肉，喝更多的酒，为的是不让自己的精神崩溃。说起来，最叫人同情的是新娘，还未跟丈夫拥抱，就成了丧夫之女。那是怎样的一个丈夫啊！即便化成了鬼魂仍那么气宇轩昂、雍容高贵，活着的时候又该是多么出众啊！她的哀哭号泣响彻了屋宇。

守寡的第二天晚上，她回寝室休息，身旁有一位姑妈陪伴——后者硬要陪她一起睡觉。这位姑妈算是德国最能讲鬼怪故事的人了，此时所讲的是一个极长的鬼怪故事，没讲完她自己就睡着了。寝室所处的位置比较偏，俯瞰着一个小花园。侄女心事重重地躺在床上，呆呆望着冉冉升起的月亮把颤抖的月光投在窗前一株白杨树的枝叶上。城堡里刚敲过午夜的钟声，突然从花园里飘来一阵袅袅的乐声。她急忙从床上爬起来，轻手轻脚走到窗前。但见婆娑的树影里有一个高大的身影。当那人仰起头的时候，一道月光正好照在他的脸上。天呀！她发现那人竟是鬼新郎！就在这时，她的耳边响起了一声尖利的惊叫，原来她的姑妈也被乐声唤醒，悄悄跟在她后面走到了窗口，这当儿昏倒在了侄女的怀里。新娘再向窗外看时，鬼新郎已不见了踪影。

在这两个女人当中，最需要安慰的是那位姑妈——她已被吓得灵魂出窍。至于年轻的新娘，觉得对方虽是鬼魂，似乎也有着可亲可爱的地方。鬼魂固然难以满足一个害相思病的姑娘的感情，却也同样具有男子汉的英武，真人不可得，鬼魂亦可作为心灵的慰藉。姑妈宣称，再也不能叫她歇宿于这个寝室了，侄女这次却异常倔强，以同样强硬的语气说自己非此处不睡。结果，她将独眠于此。在她的恳求下，姑妈答应她不把闹鬼的事情讲出去，免得她连这一丁点人世间的悲情欢乐也享受不到——对她而言，住在一个由恋人的鬼魂在夜间站岗守卫的寝室，就是一种欢乐。

好心的老小姐究竟能把自己的诺言遵守多久，那就很难说了，因为她太喜欢讲奇闻异事了，能成为讲述这个可怕故事的第一人，那将是一件很能叫人感到得意的事情。不过，她倒是把秘密在肚子里闷了整整一个星期，至今这一带的人还把此事当作女人能严守秘密的佐证广为流传。一个星期后的一天早晨，一个消息传来，突然间解除了对她的所有约束。早饭时，人们发现男爵小姐不见了。她的房间空无一人……床上无人睡过……窗户洞开，那个笼中小鸟已经飞走！

一个伟大的人物突遭不幸，会在朋友间引起震动。只有亲眼见过这种场面的人才能想象得来男爵小姐失踪的消息会在城堡里造成多么大的惊惶和骚动。甚至就连那些穷亲戚也暂时中止了永不知疲倦的大吃大喝。那位姑妈一开始被吓得说不出话，惊得把手搓来搓去，后来才尖叫出了声：“是那个鬼！是那个鬼！那个鬼把小姐掳走了！”

她三言两语讲述了自己在花园里看到的那叫人毛骨悚然的一幕，一口咬定说那个鬼拐走了新娘。两个仆人证实了她的结论，说他们听见有马蹄声向山下去了，毫无疑问是那个鬼骑着黑色骏马把新娘带向了坟墓。这是一种不祥的征兆，让在场的人无不震惊，因为这类事情在德国极为寻常，有许多详实的历史书籍都有记载。

可怜的男爵处境悲惨，令人惋惜！一个爱女心重的父亲，一个伟大的卡特赞尼兰博根家族的成员，竟遭此不幸，实在令人心痛！他唯一的掌上明珠被带进了坟墓，或者说他将有一个妖怪女婿，恐怕还会有一大堆妖怪外孙。他六神无主，茫然不知所措。整个城堡人声鼎沸，乱作一团。他吩咐手下备马，一定要把奥登瓦德的大路小径、沟沟壑壑全都搜查个遍。只见他穿上长筒靴，腰挂宝剑，准备上马去搜寻（也许是徒劳的搜寻）。而就在这当儿，前方出现了一幕奇异的情景，使他愣住了——一个女子骑一匹小马朝着城堡跑了过来，旁边有一位骑士相伴。女子飞驰到城门前，飞身下马，跪倒在男爵的脚下，抱定他的双膝。女子不是别人，正是他那失踪的女儿，而陪伴她的骑士却是那个鬼新郎！男爵这一惊非同小可。他看看爱女，再看看那个鬼，简直都不敢相信自己的眼睛了。鬼新郎上次去了冥界，此时归来，看上去已大为改观。他衣帽光鲜，雄赳赳一身阳刚气，俨然一副贵族相，脸色不再惨白，表情不再阴郁，英俊的脸上朝气蓬勃，洋溢着青春的气息，一双黑色的大眼睛闪烁着欢乐的光芒。

这次神秘的事件很快就得到了澄清。这位骑士报了自己的名姓，说他是赫尔曼·冯·斯塔肯浮士德爵士（其实，诸位自始至终就知道他非鬼非怪）。他讲述了自己和那位年轻的伯爵所遇到的危险，说他快马加鞭到城堡来报告噩耗，而男爵滔滔不绝说话没个完，他每次想把事情讲清都插不进口。见到新娘后，他的一颗心都被俘虏了去。为了能在新娘身边多待上几个小时，他默然不语，让误会持续了下去。他心里既慌又乱，真不知怎样才能体面地抽身而退，后来男爵讲鬼怪故事激发了他的灵感，想出了这么一个离奇古怪的退路。由于害怕男爵不忘家族世仇，只好夜间偷偷来访……出没于花园，来到男爵小姐的窗下……向小姐表达爱意……赢得了小姐的芳心……成功地携小姐逃离家门……总而言之，他娶了这位绝代佳人。

要是换上别的事情，男爵是绝不会让步的，因为他一向顽固地坚持父亲的权威，并且对家族仇恨没齿难忘。不过他爱自己的女儿，曾经为爱女的失踪悲恸欲绝，此刻见她安然无恙，不由欣喜若狂。女婿固然是仇家儿郎，但谢天谢地，毕竟不是个鬼怪。有一点必须承认：这位骑士装神弄鬼，曾经欺骗过他，与他做人应该诚实的观念背道而驰。但在场的有几位打过仗的老朋友，他们说恋人们玩些花样是情有可原的——这位骑士不久前还在骑兵队里服役，当然享有这种特权。

因此，所有的事情都圆满解决了。男爵当场就宽恕了这一对新婚夫妇。城堡里恢复了欢庆的场面。穷亲戚们对家族的这位新成员交口称赞，说他风流倜傥、慷慨大方……还说他家有万贯之财。说句实话，两个姑妈多少有点愤慨，想不到她们严格地让男爵小姐与世隔绝，教导她服从管教，最后竟然有一个如此糟糕的结局。她们觉得都怪自己疏忽大意，没有给窗户装铁栅栏。一位姑妈讲述过自己看见鬼的情景，此时竟出现了这样的情况，不由倍感沮丧——她此生所见过的唯一的一个鬼到头来却是个假货。不过，她们的侄女发现那个鬼是个有血有肉的大活人，似乎高兴到了极点。本故事以圆满的结局告终。

睡谷的传说


——迪德里希·尼克博克的遗作

昏昏欲睡，看得见赏心悦目的情景，

眼睛半睁半闭，面前一场梦境；

华丽宫殿耸立在云层，

千古不变闪耀于夏日的天空。

——《懒散的城堡》(1)

哈德逊河东岸有一些河湾，呈锯齿形排列，其中有一处，水面极其辽阔，荷兰古代航行家称之为塔潘湾。穿过这片水域，他们总会谨慎地收帆，祈求圣尼古拉斯(2)的保佑。此处有个小集镇（或称商埠），有些人把它叫作格林斯柏格，但它还有一个更出名、更合适的名字叫作逗留镇。据说，这个名字是附近的一些村妇给起的，原因是她们的丈夫养成了一种癖性，每逢赶集日就逗留在镇上的酒馆里，流连忘返。随他们怎么说吧，反正我也无法举证，仅仅提一提罢了，说明我讲述的事情是有凭有据的。离这个小镇不远，大约在两英里开外，高山之间有一个小山谷，或者不如说是一块凹地，那儿恐怕是天下最安静的地方了。一条小溪穿谷而过，汩汩的水声如催眠曲使人昏昏欲睡，唯有偶尔一声鹌鹑的轻啼，或者啄木鸟啄木的声音，才会打破弥漫四野的寂静。

记得我少年时，第一次去打松鼠，就是在这个山谷一侧山腰上高大的胡桃树林子里。进林子时，正值中午，四周安静得出奇。我开了一枪，连我自己都被吓了一跳。那枪声打破了遍及四方的沉寂，久久不息，轰隆隆在山谷里回响。假如有一天我想隐居，躲开这纷纷扰扰的尘世，躲开麻烦不断的人生，悠悠然在梦境中度过余生，真不知还有什么地方比这个小山谷更为理想的了。

由于此地安静得令人昏昏欲睡，由于这儿的居民（最初来此处定居的荷兰人的后裔）性情落落寡合，这条与世隔绝的山谷长久以来被称为“睡谷”，此处的村童则被附近一带的人一致称作 “睡谷之子”。仿佛有一种昏沉沉、催梦的力量笼罩着整个山谷，甚至渗透入了那儿的空气中。有人说，殖民初期曾有一个神通广大的德国医生给这个地方施了魔法；还有人说，远在亨德利克·哈德逊船长发现这一带之前，就有一位印第安酋长，一个印第安族的先知或巫师之类的人物，曾给这条山谷施加过巫术。看来果真如此——至今，此地仍在某种魔力的影响之下，使得老百姓大脑受到控制，连走路也晕晕乎乎如在梦中。对于形形色色的奇谈怪论，他们都笃信不疑，整日恍恍惚惚，胡思乱想，经常以为自己看到了异象，以为自己听见空中传来天籁之音和天人的说话声。这儿到处闹鬼，到处盛传鬼怪故事，充斥着神秘的迷信色彩；山谷的上空出现流星雨以及彗星闪过的频率比其他任何一个地方都要多；梦魔和她的九个小鬼(3)似乎把这里当作了最喜爱的游乐场。

这是个神鬼出没的地方，而佼佼者则是一个骑在马背上的无头鬼，他似乎是所有天神天鬼的领袖。据有些人说，他是一个黑森州的(4)骑兵的鬼魂，在革命战争(5)中的一次无名战役里，脑袋给一颗炮弹打飞了。乡民们时常看见他在茫茫的夜色里疾驰而过，快如驾风飞过。他不仅出没于山谷中，有时也会出没于附近的大路小径，特别是离山谷不太远的教堂一带。实际上，本地区的一些可靠的历史学家已经把关于这个无头鬼的传说细心地收集起来，并且核对过了。他们声称，这个骑兵的尸身埋在教堂的墓地里，其阴魂夜夜都要骑马去昔日的战场寻找他的头颅。有时，他飞驰过山谷，速度快得就像一阵风，那是因为他耽搁得太久，急着要在天亮前赶回教堂墓地里去呢。

这个迷信传说的大致内容就是如此，它给这个神鬼出没的地区许多荒诞不经的故事提供了素材。该地区的住户在火炉边讲故事时，将此鬼称为“睡谷的无头骑兵”。

值得一提的是：我刚才说的这种见神见鬼的癖性，并不为山谷里土生土长的居民独有，但凡在此处住过一段时间的人，无不于不知不觉之中受之感染。在步入这个睡意蒙眬的地区之前，不管他们的头脑是多么清醒，只要待很短一段时间，吸几口具有魔力的空气，一定会受到影响，开始胡思乱想，做各种各样的梦，看到各种各样的鬼。

说起这块平静的小天地，我多有的是赞誉之词。在偌大的纽约州，这种带有荷兰风情的僻静的小山谷处处可见。在这个浮躁的国家里，他处移民潮和社会进步的潮流汹涌澎湃，催生了各种各样的变化，而此处的人口、风俗和习惯却始终不变。时代的潮流从旁边悄悄地流过。这些山谷就像隐身于湍流旁的一个个宁静的小水洼，看得见麦秆和泡沫静静地浮在水面，或者慢悠悠徘徊于这个微型港湾里，全然不受旁边匆匆流过的湍流的影响。想当年我曾在睡谷里那令人昏昏欲睡的树荫下散步，而今多年的时光已经逝去。但我相信，那些树木和人家仍在睡谷那隐秘的怀抱里繁衍生息。

在大自然的这个僻静的角落里，美国历史中很久以前的一个时间段里，也就是说在大约三十年前吧，出现过一位可敬的人物，名叫伊卡博德·克莱恩。此人移居于睡谷，或者按他的话说“逗留”于睡谷，为的是教育这一带的孩子们。他的老家是康涅狄格州，彼州为合众国提供了许多开发思想和开发森林的先驱，年年都会派出大批人才去边疆伐木，以及到乡村施教。克莱恩(6)这个姓对于他还是有点贴切的——他身材瘦长瘦长、窄肩膀、长胳膊长腿，两只手荡来荡去，离袖口简直有一英里远，两只脚完全可以当铲子使用，整个躯干松松垮垮，小脑袋，脑袋顶部是平的，两只耳朵大得像扇子，眼睛像两个大大的绿色玻璃球，鼻子长得似鹬嘴。这样的一颗脑袋，安在他那细长的脖子上，看上去像一只可以随时报告风向的风信鸡。刮风天里要是看见他从山腰大步流星走来，衣服鼓起，随风飘荡，你准会以为他是个饿鬼来到了人间，或者会把他错当成稻草人，从田间偷跑了出来。

他的学校是一座只有一个大房间的矮屋，用原木草草搭成，窗户有的镶嵌着玻璃，有的糊着旧习字簿的纸页。学校里无人的时候，自有巧妙的安全措施——用一根柳条缠在门柄上，再用几根木桩顶住窗板；这样，小偷进来容易出去难；此种防范措施，极可能是建筑师尤思特·冯·胡腾想出来的，而这位建筑师的灵感大概来源于捕鳗用的细颈篮那种神秘的结构。学校地点偏僻，但风景还算不错，位于一座林木茂盛的小山脚下，旁边有一条潺潺流淌的小溪，校舍的一端长着一株粗大的桦树。在令人昏昏欲睡的夏日，这里可以听见小学生们喃喃的读书声，声音很低，嗡嗡嗡的，像蜂巢里的蜜蜂在叫。这种声音时不时会被老师严厉的呵斥声打断，口吻有时是威胁，有时则是命令。也可能，打断读书声的是桦树枝条抽打学生的那种噼啪噼啪的骇人声音——这位老师用这种方式督促混日子的差生沿着繁花似锦的求知道路前行。实话实说，这位老师是个认真负责的人，心里时刻铭记着那条黄金格言：“小孩不打不成器。”伊卡博德·克莱恩的学生的确没少挨打。

不过，我可不想让读者以为他是学校里的一个心狠手辣的专制君主，以抽打学生为乐事。事实恰恰相反，他在执法的时候，总是区别对待，而非一味严厉。他常常轻饶弱者，严惩强者。遇到一见教鞭便吓得缩成一团的弱小孩子犯规，他会起宽容之心，放他们一马，而对于那些桀骜不驯、顽固不化、身穿宽松衣的荷兰小顽童，为了维护公理，他就加倍地惩罚。小顽童们绷着脸，硬不低头，越打越顽固，越打越倔强。他将这种惩罚称为“代他们的父母尽职”。每次惩罚完之后，他都要对顽童说几句安慰的话，说这都是为他们好，“他们会永远记住这教训，在以后的人生中，他们会因此而感谢他的”。

放学以后，他甚至成了大一些孩子的伙伴，跟他们一起玩耍。每逢节假日的下午，对于一些年纪较小的孩子，他都会护送其回家——小孩子家中往往有漂亮的姐姐或好客的妈妈，后者会以好酒好菜加以款待。实际上，他很有必要跟学生们搞好关系。教学方面，他收入微薄，恐怕连一日三餐的用项都不够——他虽然瘦，食量却很大，消化力堪比蟒蛇。不过，还是有补救办法的——根据该地区乡下的习惯，他可以到学生家中，吃住于农夫之家。于是，他在每个学生家里住一个星期，一家一家轮流住。每次入住，他都会随身携带一个小包袱，里面包着他的全部财产。

为了避免让农夫东家们花费过大，使得农夫们觉得上学划不来，负担太重，而教书先生都是些混吃混喝的人，于是他便用各种方法效力，表示自己是有用的，是讨人喜欢的。于是，他时常下田帮着干些轻活，帮着晾晒干草、修补篱笆、牵马饮水、赶牛回栏，以及劈柴冬天烧火用。他会放下在学校那个小王国里称王称霸的架子，撇开那种唯我独尊、盛气凌人的神态，变得十分温柔、异常随和。他会哄着孩子玩，尤其是哄那些幼婴，以赢得母亲们的好感，就像一只猛狮宽宏大量地抚育小羊羔(7)，坐在那儿，把孩子抱在膝上，用脚晃动着摇篮，一晃就是数个小时。

除了干这些杂事之外，他还教本地区的居民唱歌，教年轻人们唱赞美诗，因而获得了许多亮晃晃的先令。星期天，他会率领一班精挑细选出来的歌手到教堂去，站在教众面前亮相。此时，他沾沾自喜、不可一世，觉得出尽了风头，地位高出牧师一筹。此言不虚，因为他的歌声嘹亮，声音盖过了在场所有的人，奇怪的是至今教堂里仍余音袅袅。在寂静的星期天的上午，他的歌声半英里开外都可以听得见，声音直达磨坊水塘的对岸。据说，伊卡博德·克莱恩的歌声的确具有这样的力量。这位可敬的学究便是如此度日，处心积虑地（即普通人所说的“绞尽脑汁、不择手段”）寻找一些零碎差事勉强过活。有些人不了解脑力劳动之艰辛，还以为他过的是神仙一般的逍遥日子呢。

在乡下的女人圈里，老师可算是显赫的人物。女人们觉得当老师的是悠闲安逸、绅士一类的人，品位和才艺都远高于粗鲁的乡下小伙子，实际上，论学问只比牧师低一丁点。于是乎，伊卡博德·克莱恩只要出现在农家屋里，势必会在茶桌旁引起一阵忙乱——女人们会额外添上一盘糕饼或者蜜饯，偶尔还会摆上一把银质茶壶撑撑门面。我们的这位知识分子见年轻的农家女们笑脸相迎，不由心里乐开了花。星期天做礼拜中间休息，他陪着娇娘们走到教堂的院落里，见周围的树木上野藤缠绕，便从野藤上采摘葡萄献给她们，或背诵墓碑上的铭文供她们消遣，或在众多娇娘的簇拥下漫步于附近的磨坊水塘边。那些土包子乡下小伙子见他风度翩翩、谈吐高雅，难免嫉妒，急忙含羞躲避一旁。

他过的是一种半游牧式的生活，俨然就是个“流动信息站”，走家串户，把当地的小道消息带往各户人家，所到之处无不受到热情欢迎。此外，女人们敬重他，认为他是个学识渊博的人，因为他通读过许多书，可以说是科顿·马瑟(8)的《新英格兰巫术史》一书的绝对权威（顺便提一句，他本人坚定不移地相信巫术）。

实际上，他是个很复杂的人物，既有一些小智慧，又有点信神信鬼。他对稀奇古怪事物的爱好，以及对这类现象的领悟能力，都是非同寻常的，再加上生活在一个受魔力控制的地区，这种爱好和能力更是加强了不少。无论多么庸俗的故事，无论多么荒唐的传说，他都饶有兴趣地一概接受。他常常喜欢在下午放学之后，走到学校旁边那条潺潺流淌的小溪边，躺在茂盛的苜蓿丛上面，在那儿细细地阅读马瑟写的那些令人毛骨悚然的故事，直至暮色越来越浓，书上的字在眼前变得模糊不清。这时，他便放下书，沿着沼泽、小溪和可怕的森林，一路走到他所寄宿的那户农家。这是一个鬼怪出没的时刻，大自然里每一种响动都会令他心跳，激发他的种种想象。山坡上北美夜鹰(9)的一声啼叫、预告暴风雨来临的树蟾的叫声、猫头鹰凄厉的哀鸣、树丛中鸟儿受惊后逃窜发出的窸窣声，都会使他浮想联翩。萤火虫在最黑的地方发的光最亮——途中，时而会有一只特别亮的萤火虫从他面前飞过，吓他一大跳。如果碰巧有一只笨头笨脑的甲虫瞎飞瞎撞地朝他扑过来，这个可怜的人儿一定会吓得灵魂出窍，会以为是巫婆在施巫术。这种时候，为了驱除恐惧的心理，或者说为了赶走恶鬼，他唯一的办法就是唱赞美诗。他的歌声带着鼻音，拖得长长的，十分悦耳，从远处的山坡上飘来，或者回荡在暮色苍茫的小道上，睡谷的居民们于黄昏时分坐在自家门前听了，敬畏之心常常油然而生。

他还有一种乐趣也挺可怕的。在漫长的冬季的夜晚，他会和那些在火炉旁纺线的荷兰大妈们一道消磨时光——大妈们一边纺线，一边把苹果串在一起放在火上烤，烤得苹果发出刺啦刺啦的响声，一边还讲些神神鬼鬼的奇怪故事，什么鬼田、鬼溪、鬼桥和鬼屋啦，尤其爱讲那个无头的骑兵（她们有时称其为“睡谷的黑森骑兵”）。他也给大妈们讲巫婆的故事，讲早先流传于康涅狄格州的有关于各种凶兆的传说，有关于出现在空中的各种恐怖景象和声音的传说，同样令大妈们听得津津有味；他还会讲关于彗星和流星的种种猜想，告诉她们一个惊人的事实——地球是一直在转动的，地球人一半时间都是头朝下脚朝上生活着，吓得大妈们心惊肉跳。

他舒舒服服地坐在壁炉旁边，壁炉里木柴烧得哔哔剥剥地响，火光映得满室通红，根本不用害怕野鬼光顾。如果说这是一种享受的话，那么，这种享受是要付出高昂代价的，因为回家的路上他会感到非常害怕。在大雪纷飞的夜晚，白光幽幽，阴森可怕，仿佛有孤魂野鬼出现在他的面前！他多么渴望远处人家的窗口能闪出一线灯光，让那颤巍巍的灯光洒在这茫茫的荒野上啊！不知有多少次，路上看见披着白雪的灌木丛，像是裹着尸衣的鬼魂，吓得他屁滚尿流！不知有多少次，踩在冰雪覆盖的地面上，脚下咯吱作响，他被自己弄出的声响吓得魂飞天外，看也不敢朝后看一眼，生怕会瞧到什么狰狞的鬼怪紧随在他身后！不知有多少次，狂风吹过树林，林涛怒吼，吓得他大气不敢出，还以为是那个黑森骑兵疾驰而过，趁着夜色去寻找自己的头颅！

不过，这只是夜间的一些惊悚现象，是摸黑走路心里幻想出来的情景。他一生虽见鬼无数，独自出行时，非止一次遇见撒旦变成各种模样出现在面前，但天一亮，一切妖魔鬼怪都遁去了形影。尽管有妖魔作乱，尽管杂事缠身，他也并不在乎，要不是在人生道路上碰上一个生灵，他会高高兴兴度过一生的。此生灵给他造成的烦恼，比所有的妖魔鬼怪和巫师巫婆加在一起都要多。这生灵是一个女人。

每星期中有一个晚上，一些习乐弟子开班上课，跟他学唱赞美诗，其中有一女弟子名叫卡特丽娜·冯·塔塞尔。她是一个家境殷实的荷兰裔农夫的独生女，年方十八岁，面若桃花、美压群芳，丰满得像只小鹌鹑，那张熟透了的娇滴滴的红脸蛋赛过其父所种的鲜桃。她闻名于十里八乡，不仅因为她貌似天仙，还由于其有望继承大笔家产。同时，她还有点爱卖弄风情，这从她的服饰上可见端倪。她的服饰既有古装的典雅又有现代服装的时尚，极大限度地显现出了她的妖娆。她戴的首饰都是纯金的，黄澄澄的，是她的高祖母从萨阿丹带过来的。她上身穿一件诱人眼目的古色古香的胸衣，下穿一条惹人动心的短裙，露出她那双在本地区最漂亮的脚和脚踝。

伊卡博德·克莱恩对女性素怀柔情和痴心，难怪没多久便盯上了这块令人垂涎三尺的天鹅肉，尤其是到她父母的那幢大宅院里看望过她之后就更加如此了。巴尔图斯·冯·塔塞尔老人是个典型的家业兴旺的农夫，乐天知命、心胸开阔。除了他自己的农庄，对外边的情况他既不看也不想，这固然不错，却将农庄里的万般事务料理得舒舒服服、妥妥当当。他对自己的富有感到满足，却并不因此而盛气凌人。他因有偌大的家业而自豪，却并不追求生活的排场。他的宅院位于哈德逊河沿岸的一个僻静的小天地里，这儿绿茵铺地、土壤肥沃——荷兰裔的农夫一般都喜欢在这种地方安静度日。一株大榆树枝繁叶茂，遮护住他的房屋，树脚下有一个小泉眼，呈桶状，里面汩汩涌出清洌甘甜的泉水，静悄悄流过草地，一路泛着亮光，汇入附近的一条小溪中，溪岸上长满了赤杨和矮柳。农舍跟前有一座极大的谷仓，大得简直可以当教堂用。谷仓里装满了粮食，似乎把每个窗孔和每个缝隙都填实了。这儿，从早到晚都可听到用连枷打谷的声音，一刻也不停。小燕子和雨燕呢喃作声，在屋檐下飞来飞去；一群一群的鸽子在屋顶上晒太阳，有的翻起一只眼像是在看天气，有的将头藏在翅膀下或埋在胸前，有的昂首挺胸，有的咕咕叫着把头一点一点地求偶。一些皮毛光滑、笨乎乎的肥猪哼哼叫着，在猪圈里过着养尊处优的日子；不时会有几只正吃奶的的小猪跑出来，好像是想呼吸呼吸外边的空气。旁边的池塘里有些羽毛雪白的鹅，排成庄严的队列，与成群结队的鸭子一道游水。一群群的火鸡咯咯地叫着在院子里乱跑；院子里还有一些珍珠鸡，它们一个个怒气冲冲，气哼哼、不满地叫着，活像是脾气暴躁的家庭主妇。谷仓门前有只威风凛凛的公鸡，高视阔步，俨然就是个好丈夫、好武士、好绅士，它拍打着羽毛鲜亮的翅膀，发出豪迈和高兴的叫声，有时会用爪子刨土觅食，找到食物后就慷慨地唤来它那总是饥肠辘辘的妻子儿女，让它们大快朵颐。

这位学究看见这许多食物可供冬日饱餐，不禁口水直流。他心里像有只馋虫，不由想入非非，想象着那些跑来跑去的乳猪上了烤架，肚子里塞着布丁，嘴里含着苹果；想象着那些鸽子舒舒服服安眠于一个大馅饼里，身上盖了一层面皮当被子；白鹅们在汤盆里游泳；鸭子成双成对，身上抹了厚厚一层洋葱酱，安详地卧于菜碟上，就像是一对对新婚伉俪。看到猪，他就联想到了香喷喷的培根和鲜嫩可口的火腿；看见火鸡，他则联想到它们被绑起来，脑袋塞在翅膀下面，偶尔脖子上还挂着一串美味的腊肠当项链；甚至连那只雄赳赳的公鸡也直挺挺躺在了加餐盘上，爪子朝天，仿佛在讨饶——活着的时候，就凭它那威武的武士风度，是绝不会如此低三下四的。

伊卡博德·克莱恩发挥着自己的想象，想得都入了迷。他那绿色的大眼睛滴溜溜转，望着冯·塔塞尔家四周那丰茂的草地，望着那种植着小麦、黑麦、荞麦和玉米的肥田，望着那果实累累的果园，心里思慕着将要继承这一切财产的姑娘，想象力进一步膨胀，想到他将会把这些财产转手变为现金，投资购买下无边无际的野地，在那儿盖起一幢幢的房屋。他心里翻江倒海，幻想着自己的愿望已经实现，已经将如花似玉的卡特丽娜娶到了手，并且生儿育女。卡特丽娜带着儿女坐上马车，车上装着家里的杂物，车下挂着水壶和煎锅，而那些水壶和煎锅随车一摇一晃的，他则骑一匹母马护卫，后面跟着一匹小马，全家取道前往肯塔基或田纳西——或者是只有老天才知道的地方！

走进冯·塔塞尔家的家门，他的心就完全被征服了。这是一幢宽敞的农舍，屋脊高，屋顶呈斜坡状，垂得很低，这是第一代荷兰移民传下来的建筑风格——那低垂的屋檐在房前遮出一道走廊，走廊有门，雨雪天可以关闭。屋檐下挂着连枷、马具、各种耕作用具以及到附近河里捕鱼用的渔网。走廊两侧有几条长凳，供夏天纳凉时坐，而两端各放着一架大纺车和一台搅乳器，由此可见这条走廊十分重要，有着各种各样的用途。沿着这条走廊，心里遐想不已的伊卡博德步入了大厅，此处是整幢宅子的中心，是家里人经常聚会的地方。大厅里有一个长长的食具柜，上面摆着几排亮晃晃的锡镴制器皿，照得他眼花。一个角落里放着一只大口袋，里面装着待纺的羊毛；另一个角落堆着一匹匹刚从织机上取下来的棉毛制品；墙上挂着一串串的玉米和用绳子穿缀起来的干苹果、干桃子，犹如花饰一般，其中还夹杂着许多色彩艳丽的红辣椒；一扇门半开半掩，通向那间最讲究的起居室，他探首望去，只见那儿有爪足椅和深色红木桌子，件件亮得如明镜一样；铁制柴架和火铲、火钳都闪闪发着亮光，而柴架上挂着一些芦笋尖；几个工艺品橘子和海螺壳摆在壁炉架上作为装饰；壁炉架的上方挂着一串串各种颜色的鸟蛋；房间的正中央挂着一枚巨型鸵鸟蛋；墙拐角有一个碗橱，故意开着，露出许多珍贵的古代银器以及精心修补的古瓷器。

自打看见了这些令人赏心悦目的景象那一刻起，伊卡博德的心就再也平静不下来了。他现在唯一的念头，就是设法去赢得冯·塔塞尔的那个美艳女儿的爱情。然而，此举困难重重，其艰难程度远超过那些追求爱情的游侠骑士的命运。那些骑士要对付的只是些巨人、巫士、喷火的龙，以及诸如此类容易战胜的对手。他们只要打开一条路， 穿过铁门或铜门，翻越坚固的城墙，闯入囚禁着意中人的城堡就行了，容易得就跟切圣诞节的蛋糕一样，一下就可以切到中心。进了城堡，便能够获得美人心了。伊卡博德则不然，他得一路闯关去获得一个乡村女子的心，这颗心任性，反复无常，叫人难以捉摸，总是给你制造困难和障碍。同时，他还得对付一大批有血有肉的可怕的对手——无数爱慕她的乡下少年。那些少年把守着通到她心里去的每一扇门，彼此争风吃醋，相互怒目而视、虎视眈眈，可是一见新敌手出现，便会组成联合阵线，合力迎敌。少年中，有一个身材魁梧、吼声如雷、性如烈火的家伙最可怕。此人名叫亚伯拉罕，荷兰语的称呼叫布鲁姆·冯·布隆特。他是本地区的勇士，素以膂力过人和好勇斗狠著称。他膀大腰圆、肌肉强健，一头鬈发又黑又短，一张脸带着野性，但并不惹人讨厌，挂着愉快的表情，气势凌人。这么一个彪形大汉，再加上其力大无穷，因此获得“布鲁姆勇士”这一绰号，成了个闻名遐迩的人物。在骑马方面，他既精通理论又精通技巧，在马背上灵巧自如，和鞑靼人无异。若论赛马和斗鸡，他每次都能夺魁。在乡下，有力气就有威信。于是，邻里之间出现争端，就由他裁断。这时，他会歪戴着帽子，做出决断，语气坚定，不容置辩。他总是喜欢跟人打架或者恶作剧，这倒不是说他生就一副邪恶肚肠，而是因为性格顽皮。尽管看上去顽劣不堪，他其实却有着侠义风骨。他身边有三四个哥们，把他视为学习的榜样。他领着这几个哥们闯荡江湖，方圆几英里内有人打架或者出现热闹的场景，他们必到现场。冷天，他总是戴一顶皮帽子，帽子上缀一根夺人眼球的狐狸尾巴，叫人一看就知道是他。乡下凡有集会，就凭着这个标记，人们老远就能认出他来，随即闪至一旁，看着这几位勇猛的骑手呼啸而过。有时候，半夜三更也能听见他们一小队人马咋咋呼呼地从农舍旁飞驰而过，就像一队冲锋陷阵的顿河流域的哥萨克骑兵。熟睡的老妪从梦中惊醒，竖起耳朵听一听，直至那嗒嗒嗒的急促的马蹄声渐行渐远，这才长叹一声说：“唉，又是‘布鲁姆勇士’他们那一帮子人！”乡亲们看待他，心情十分复杂，既有畏惧，又有佩服和无奈。只要该地有人搞恶作剧，或者出现打架斗殴的事情，乡亲们总会摇摇头，断定又是“布鲁姆勇士”在兴风作浪了。

这个粗野撒泼的英雄不知何时相中了如花似玉的卡特丽娜，以粗野的方式对她大献殷勤，虽然他的爱情和表达爱情的手段有点像一只熊的温存和爱抚，但有人暗地里说，她没有完全叫他失望。有一点是肯定的：他的进攻就等于是一种信号，使得情敌们知难而退，因为谁都不愿意招惹一头正在发情的雄狮。于是乎，星期日晚上，只要一见他的马拴在冯·塔塞尔家门外的拴马桩上，便可以断定马的主人在里面求爱，或者用术语说正在“迸发火花”，其他的追求者便会绝望地走开，将战火燃烧到别的战场上去。

伊卡博德·克莱恩就是要跟这么一个令人生畏的情敌一决雌雄。综合考虑各种因素，比他更强壮的人恐怕也会退出竞争的，比他更聪慧的人也会以绝望告终。不过，他的性格却有着刚柔并济的特点，其肉体和精神就像一根藤手杖，易弯曲，但坚韧，有时会弯下腰身，却绝不会折断——哪怕受到一丁点压力他也会低头，然而压力一消退，他又会挺起胸膛，把头昂得跟以前一样高。

要说公开对抗“布鲁姆勇士”这样的情敌，那纯粹是发疯。这位情敌正在发情，绝不会认输的，其爱情的热度不次于那个疯狂恋人阿喀琉斯(10)。因而，伊卡博德的进攻采取的是静悄悄的迂回战术。他以音乐教师的身份作为掩护，经常到她家里去访问；不过，他这样做，并不是怕受到她父母的干涉（对恋人们而言，父母经常是爱情路上的拦路虎）。巴尔图斯·冯·塔塞尔平易近人，有着深厚的舐犊之情，爱自己的女儿甚至胜过爱他的烟斗。像所有通情达理、心胸开阔的慈父一样，他由着女儿按自己的性子做事。至于他的贤妻，手头的事都忙不过来呢，既要料理家务，又要看管鸡鸭。这位贤妻自有高见，认为家禽缺乏头脑，需要人照料，而女孩子是能够照顾好自己的。于是便出现了这样的情况：这位贤妻忙得在屋里跑来跑去，或者坐在走廊的一端纺纱，而老实巴交的巴尔图斯则坐在走廊的另一端，于暮色中吸着烟斗望着谷仓顶上那个木刻的小武士手持双剑跟屋顶上的风英勇作战。与此同时，伊卡博德却在大榆树下的泉水旁向这家的千金调情求爱，或者陪着这位千金踏着暮色散步。在暮色里，恋人说出的话最为动听。

我得声明：我本人对如何打动和赢得一个女人的心一窍不通。我觉得情场上的事如谜团一般扑朔迷离，让人佩服。有些女人似乎只有一个弱点，或者说只有一扇门可通达她们的心，有的则有千百条途径，可用千百种方法一举将她们的芳心俘获。要想俘获前一种女人，必须技艺高超，而俘获后一种女人就得有更大的本事，必须像将军一样懂得运筹帷幄，因为进攻者必须从各扇门、各扇窗户同时进攻才能攻克堡垒。赢得成千个普通女人的心固然值得称道，但只有能够把风骚女的心牢牢控制住的男人，才能称得上是真正的英雄。那个恶煞星一样的“布鲁姆勇士”当然不属于后一类情况；自从伊卡博德开始进攻，他的热情很明显在走下坡路了。星期天的晚上，再也看不见他的马拴在冯·塔塞尔家门外的拴马桩上了。渐渐地，他和睡谷的这位教师之间便产生了不共戴天的敌意。

若按布鲁姆好斗逞勇的天性，乐得光明正大地打一场，一了百了地解决这件争风吃醋的事情，方法简单合理，即按照古代游侠的风格以决斗见胜负。而伊卡博德深知这位情敌膂力超人，哪敢单一对决。他听说这位“布鲁姆勇士”放过狠话，说是要把 “这个教书先生对折起来，放在他自己学校里的书架上”。他好汉不吃眼前亏，决不能叫布鲁姆的狠话落到实处。他坚持以和平的方式解决争端，气得布鲁姆无计可施，不由将顽劣的天性暴露了出来，搞出一些野蛮的恶作剧作弄自己的情敌。“布鲁姆勇士”率领着他的那班顽徒千方百计地捉弄起伊卡博德来。他们不断侵扰他那平静的小王国，堵死唱歌学校的烟囱，把师生们熏出教室；尽管学校夜间关门闭户，窗户上装着铁栅栏，防范措施严密，他们照样会攻入校门，把里面翻个底朝天，搅得伊卡博德慌了神，以为是全地区的巫婆都跑了来施展巫术。但更叫人气恼的是，布鲁姆一有机会就当着卡特丽娜的面取笑他，让他出乖露丑。布鲁姆养了一条恶狗，教会它用一种荒唐可笑的声音发出哀嚎，声称它的声音能和伊卡博德的声音媲美，可以教卡特丽娜唱赞美诗。

这种状况持续了一段时间，敌对双方的情况没有发生实质性的变化。在一个风和日丽的秋日的下午，伊卡博德怀着满腹的心事，正襟危坐于教室里的高凳上，像往常一样看管着他的这个知识小王国里的一切事务。他晃动着手中的戒尺（戒尺乃象征着他专制权力的权杖），而执法用的桦树条安居在他宝座后边的三颗钉子上，这些对喜欢捣乱的学生起着威慑作用。他面前的书桌上，可以看到各种偷偷带进学校的小玩意儿以及严厉禁止的武器，这些都是从不学无术的顽童身上搜出来的，其中有吃了一半的苹果、气枪、陀螺、苍蝇笼子，还有许多纸折的气势汹汹的小斗鸡。显而易见，教室里刚刚出现过严厉的执法事件，因为学生们都在认真看书，但也有的人用一只眼盯着老师，拿书本挡住脸在悄悄说话，一片寂静中可以听见嗡嗡嗡的声音。突然，这种气氛被一个黑人的出现打破了。黑人穿一身粗麻布衣服和长裤，戴着一种圆顶的破帽子（帽子的形状与墨丘利(11)的帽子一样），骑一匹脏兮兮、野性未驯的小马，用一根麻绳当作马缰。他啪嗒啪嗒来到学校门前，送来了一份请柬，邀请伊卡博德当晚去冯·塔塞尔家参加联欢会——或称联谊会。他显示出很有身份的样子，说话文质彬彬、咬文嚼字——黑人办这类小事，总喜欢讲讲排场。完成了这项使命之后，他转身离去，纵马越过小溪，在山谷里飞奔，表现出有重任在身、刻不容缓的派头。

刚才还安安静静的教室这下子乱成了一锅粥。学生们被催得读课文的速度加快，即便念错了也一带而过；那些滑头的学生甚至将课文跳过去一半不读也不受罚；那些读得慢的，则响亮地挨上一教鞭，以此让他们加速，或者说是帮助他们跳过某个难读的字。之后，课本被随便扔在一边，懒得放到书架上去；墨水瓶被打翻；凳子被推倒；全校比平时提前一个小时放了学。学生们冲到外边的草地上，大声喊叫和笑闹，因这么早便获得解放而欢欣鼓舞，就像一群小精灵。

接下来，情意缠绵的伊卡博德开始梳妆打扮，在这上面比平时起码多花了半个小时的时间。他拿出自己最好的衣服（其实只是件褪了色的黑外套），又是刷又是擦的。然后，他对着校舍里挂着的一块破镜子把头发拨拉来拨拉去的。为了能够像一个真正的骑士那样出现在恋人面前，他还从自己借宿的那户农家借了一匹马（这户农家的主人是个脾气暴躁的荷兰裔老头，名叫汉斯·冯·里普尔），随即英武地跨上马，前去赴约，那派头活像是一个前去冒险的骑士。我觉得，讲浪漫故事就应该讲讲故事中真正的精彩之处，所以有必要形容一下这位英雄骑士的仪表、穿戴和坐骑。他骑的这匹马是拉犁的老马，精气神已消失殆尽，顽劣的性子却没有随之消失。这畜生骨瘦如柴、皮毛零乱，脖子细得像羊脖子，脑袋的形状似榔头，肮脏的马鬃和马尾乱糟糟的，沾满了麦秸；它的一只眼没有瞳仁，恶狠狠地冒着凶光，另一只眼则幽光闪闪，仿佛里面藏着恶鬼。想当年它一定性子暴烈如火，你光从它的名字“火药”就能看得出来。其实，这畜生曾经是主人心爱的坐骑——汉斯·冯·里普尔脾气暴躁，是个烈性子骑手，很可能把自己的脾性传导给了这畜生。如今它已入晚景，风光不再，但脾气比本地区任何一匹年轻的马都暴烈。

伊卡博德和这匹马很是搭配，相得益彰。他用的是一副短镫，骑到马上，膝盖高抬，几乎能抵到前鞍，瘦削的肘部像蚱蜢腿似的伸出去；他将马鞭笔直地执在手里，像执着权杖。马儿蹒跚行进，他的两只胳膊一晃一晃，就好像鸟儿在拍打翅膀。一顶羊毛小帽扣在他的鼻梁上端（他的前额太窄了，权且称为鼻梁上端吧），那件黑上衣的下摆飘荡起来，几乎碰到了马尾。伊卡博德骑着马走出汉斯·冯·里普尔家的院门时，就是这么一种模样，简直像是光天化日之下难得一遇的幽灵。

这一天正如我方才所说，是个风和日丽的秋日，天空清澈而静谧，大自然披着富丽的金黄色盛装，使人很容易联想到丰收的景象。层林尽染秋色，呈现出素雅的棕黄两色，而一些小树蒙上秋霜，显得色彩斑斓——橘黄、暗紫同猩红混杂一处。高高的天空中飞来一行一行的野鸭；山毛榉和山胡桃树丛里传来松鼠唧唧的叫声；周围一带刚割完麦子，麦茬地里不时响起一两声鹌鹑的啼鸣，声声惹人哀思。

小鸟们正在享受这最后的盛宴。它们欢情一片，扑闪着翅膀，叽叽喳喳地叫喊，忽东忽西嬉戏于灌木丛中和大树的枝头间，在这丰富多彩的天地里游玩。这里边有老实的雄知更鸟，它们是童子猎人最喜欢的猎物，叫声高亢，似吵架一般；有黑鹂，它们叫声一片，飞起来如乌云遮空；有金翅啄木鸟，它们顶着红冠，宽宽的黑肩膀，披一身华丽的羽毛；有黄连雀，它们长着红边的翅膀和黄尾巴梢，头上有一顶小羽冠；还有蓝松鸦，它们是些吵吵闹闹的花花公子，穿着鲜艳的淡蓝色外衣和白衬衫，叫不停、唱不停，又是点头致意，又是弓腰示好，那副神气就好像跟林中的鸟儿个个都处得相当融洽。

伊卡博德骑着马缓缓而行，沿途观望各种可以化为美食的果实和鸟禽，满心喜悦地欣赏着欢快、丰实的秋色。四面八方尽可见满世界的苹果，或挂在树上，压弯了枝头，或装入篮里、桶中，准备运到市场上出售，或堆积如山，准备榨汁用。放眼望去，远处可见大片的玉米田，金黄色的穗子从绿叶下探出头来，叫他联想到了玉米大饼和玉米布丁。黄澄澄的南瓜躺在玉米的穗下，朝着太阳挺起它们那漂亮的圆肚子——这样的丰收情景预示着将会有许多香喷喷的馅饼。再往前走一会儿，便到了香气扑鼻的荞麦田，这儿有一股蜂房的气味。他不由浮想联翩，想到了美味的荞麦薄煎饼，想到卡特丽娜·冯·塔塞尔用她那小小的、肉肉的纤手把黄油涂在煎饼上，再涂一层蜂蜜或糖浆，此情此景叫他心里顿生柔情蜜意。

就这样，他心里美好的念头和“甜蜜的假设”层出不穷，在连绵起伏的群山中沿着山坡前行，远远望去，可以将雄伟壮观的哈德逊河的几处旖旎的风光尽收眼底。太阳如滚动着的巨轮，渐渐向西方下沉。在辽阔的塔潘湾里，水面平稳如镜，但这儿或那儿偶尔会泛起几片微波，轻轻地摇晃，把碧蓝的远山倒影拉得长长的。几朵琥珀色云彩浮在天空，由于无风而纹丝不动。地平线抹上了一片绚丽的黄金色彩，那色彩渐渐变成了纯净的苹果绿，后来又换成了天空中部的那种蔚蓝色。夕阳的一道余晖倾斜着洒在河岸边巍巍矗立的悬崖那树木葱茏的顶端，徘徊不去，让深灰、泛紫的崖壁显得愈加幽暗。一只小帆船漂浮在远处的水面，随波逐流，船帆毫无用处地吊在桅杆上；天空的倒影映在平静的水中，使得那只船看上去像悬在半空。

伊卡博德抵达冯·塔塞尔家的宅院时，天色已近黄昏。他发现那儿济济一堂，都是当地的体面人物和花季少女。宾客中也有年纪大的农夫，瘦削的脸上皱巴巴的，穿着自家缝制的外套、长裤、蓝袜子、大皮鞋，外套上配着闪闪发亮的锡扣。他们的老伴一个个皱脸枯皮，但手脚利落，头戴缝着细密褶子的帽子，身穿长腰身的短上衣和自制的衬裙，随身带着剪刀、针线包和鲜艳的印花布口袋。健美的少女们，穿着方面差不多和她们的母亲一样老派，只是多了一顶草帽和一根漂亮的丝带，也许还多了件白罩裙什么的，于是就有了几分城里人的时髦风度。小伙子们则穿着短上衣，衣服的下摆方方正正的，上缀几排巨大的铜扣，一般都梳着当时流行的发型——能够搞到鳗鱼皮发膏者尤为青睐这种发型。当地人推崇鳗鱼皮发膏，认为它能够滋润头发，对头发有定型作用。

若论此时此刻的风云人物，便非“布鲁姆勇士”莫属了。他来参加聚会，骑的是他那匹心爱的马“冒失鬼”。 这个畜牲和它的主人一样，也是野里野气、调皮捣蛋，除了主人，别人谁都驾驭不了它。其实，“布鲁姆勇士”就喜欢骑心术不正的马，喜欢那些爱使坏心眼，巴不得叫骑手摔死的马，因为在他看来，容易驾驭的驯良的马不配给勇敢无畏的小伙子当坐骑。

说到此，我想再讲讲本故事男主角的情况——他一走进冯·塔塞尔家那辉煌壮丽的大厅，看见眼前种种诱人的景象，不由高兴得睁大了眼睛。真正吸引他眼球的并非那些丰满漂亮的少女和她们红红白白的服饰，而是在这果实累累的秋天里，那地道的、令人垂涎欲滴的荷兰乡村茶桌。只见那儿摆着一盘一盘各种各样的糕饼，有些种类简直叫不出名来，恐怕只有经验丰富的荷兰主妇才知道！其中有可口的炸面卷，有又软又糯的猪油煎饼，有又松又脆的炸糖糕，还有甜饼、松饼、姜饼、蜜饼和形形色色说不清的饼。另外还有苹果馅饼、桃肉馅饼和南瓜馅饼；有火腿片和熏牛肉；有一大盘一大盘的李子干、桃脯、梨脯和温柏果干；当然也有烤鲥鱼、烧仔鸡以及大碗大碗的牛奶和奶油，盘碗交织，摆了一大桌，情况大致如我所列。桌子的中央有一把古香古色的茶壶，壶嘴里冒出氤氲的热气……那气派的场面真是叫人叹为观止！真该多费些口舌把这些美食细细描述描述，可惜我已说得气喘吁吁，再加上时间有限，只好急匆匆讲下文了。幸亏伊卡博德·克莱恩没有像我这个记录者这般赶时间，而是不慌不忙地品尝每一种美食。

他这个人心地好、知道感恩，吃了别人家的东西，心里便高兴，脸上便欢笑——爱喝酒的人几杯酒落肚也是这种情形。他一边吃，一边禁不住溜溜转动着大眼睛观察四周，望着那奢华、辉煌得简直让人无法想象的场面，想到有朝一日自己有可能成为这儿的主人，便哑然失笑。他心想，用不了多久，他便会永远地离开那座破旧的校舍；他会冲着汉斯·冯·里普尔以及其他所有吝啬的东家轻蔑地打个响指，叫那些巡回借宿的胆敢称他为同行的教师统统滚蛋！

巴尔图斯·冯·塔塞尔在客人中间走来走去，面带满足和欢快的神情，一张圆脸、喜气洋洋，宛若中秋的满月。他表达热情的方式很简单，但效果很好——对待客人们，他仅仅是握握手、拍拍肩膀、哈哈大声笑笑，说一声“别客气，请随便哟”。

这时候，从休息室（或称会客大厅）里传来奏乐声，召唤宾客们前去跳舞。乐手是个头发灰白的老黑人，此人在该地区沿街卖艺已有半个多世纪。他的乐器和他本人一样衰老、破旧，大部分时间仅靠两三根琴弦奏乐。只见他拉一下弓点一下头；每当有新舞伴进入舞池，他便鞠一躬，几乎一躬到地，而且还跺一下脚。

伊卡博德对于自己的舞姿和歌喉颇感自豪。跳舞时，他手舞足蹈，浑身上下每一块肌肉都在舞动。看见他那松松垮垮的身子骨左摆右晃，踢踢踏踏满屋子跑，你准会以为那是受上天祝福的舞蹈家圣·维塔斯(12)转世现身了。他简直成了全体黑人崇拜的偶像；黑人们老老少少、高高矮矮，从农场和各户人家赶来看热闹，挤在门前，拥在窗口，一张张黑亮黑亮的脸聚在一起形成了金字塔状，目光中充满了喜悦，白白的眼球骨碌碌乱转，龇出一口白牙咧嘴大笑。我们的这位喜欢用教鞭抽打顽童的教师见状愈加起劲，愈加欢快。他的舞伴不是别人，正是他的心上人——这位舞伴见他脉脉含情、频抛媚眼，便淡雅地嫣然一笑。“布鲁姆勇士”看在眼里，恨在心头，嫉妒得不得了，坐在墙角独自生闷气。

跳舞结束之后，伊卡博德被一群比较有智慧的人吸引了过去——那些人和冯·塔塞尔老头坐在走廊的一端谈天说地，又是回忆往事，又是大讲特讲战争的故事。在我所说的那个时代，这个地区可以说是块灵地，满是历史典故，是个英才辈出的地方。战争期间，英军和美军曾在附近对垒；因而，此处匪患滋生，难民、牛仔以及各种边境的游骑将这儿搅得鸡犬不宁。时光流逝，每一个讲述历史故事的人都会凭着想象添油加醋，在记得不大清楚的时候，索性把自己说成是种种功业中的英雄。

这里可以听到道夫·马特林讲的故事。此人是个荷兰佬，身材高大，胡须发蓝，据说曾在战壕里开炮，用一门铁炮发射九磅重的炮弹，差点炸沉一艘英国战舰，只可惜他的那门炮开到第六炮时就报销了。还有位老先生也讲了段故事，此处就不提他的姓名了，他是个非常有钱的老爷，不能随便加以议论。他说他参加过白色平原战役，在那次防御战中作战出色，用一把短剑挡飞了一颗毛瑟枪的子弹；当时，他觉得子弹嗖的一声贴着剑锋飞过，击在剑柄上弹了出去。为了证明自己所言不虚，他随时都愿意出示那把剑，让大家看看被子弹打得有点歪的剑柄。另外还有几个人也说自己曾在战场上出生入死，建立了赫赫战功，几乎全都认为自己发挥过相当大的作用，才使得战争最终能圆满地结束。

不过，比起接下来讲的鬼怪传奇和幽灵故事，这类战争故事就是小巫见大巫了。该地区广为流传神鬼故事，这成为当地的一种瑰宝。此处比较封闭，历史悠久，成为各种传说和封建迷信的肥沃土壤。然而，流动人口在乡下的大多数地方无处不在，他们对这类传说不屑一顾。讲神鬼故事，在大多数村子里是没有市场的。不等坟墓里的鬼魂睡上一觉、伸个懒腰，活着的人早已走掉，到别的地方去了。于是乎，待鬼魂夜间出来走动时，想找个熟悉的人都找不到了。我们之所以只能在历史悠久的荷兰裔居住区听到神鬼故事，而在他处少有所闻，这恐怕便是其中的原因了。

不过，这一带流行神鬼故事，最直接的原因，无疑还是由于与睡谷紧邻。睡谷是个闹鬼的地方，那儿吹来的风都带有传染性，把梦境和幻想的气息带往四面八方。当时在冯·塔塞尔家里，正好有几位睡谷里的人也在场，他们照例又传播了一通千奇百怪的故事。有些故事耸人听闻，讲的是附近的一棵参天大树，而倒霉的安德烈少校(13)就是在那棵树下被抓住的，据说有人夜里看见了鬼出殡，听见了鬼哭丧。有的故事讲的是一身素白的女鬼，她经常出没于乌鸦山的幽暗山谷里，冬夜暴风雪来临之前常听见她那凄厉的叫喊——据说，她就是死在那儿的雪地里。这类故事的压轴戏仍是人们所喜欢的睡谷幽灵——无头骑兵，有人最近听见他经常在这一带巡逻，据说每天夜里都把马拴在教堂墓地里的坟茔之间。

这座教堂地处荒郊野外，似乎怨鬼最喜欢在这样的地方作祟。它矗立在一个小山岗之上，周围郁郁葱葱全是刺槐和高耸的榆树，它那洁白的粉墙在幽暗的林荫里羞答答地闪着微光，仿佛是纯洁的基督徒少女在含羞微笑。山坡的坡度比较缓和，一直通向一片由参天大树环绕的银光闪闪的水面，透过大树间的缝隙可以窥见哈德逊河岸上的巍巍青山。望一眼那长满青草的墓地，看见那儿阳光静谧，你会油然想到亡魂至少在那个地方可以得到安静的休息。在教堂的一侧，有一条宽宽的林木葱茏的山谷，谷中有一道奔腾咆哮的山涧，涧水中满都是乱石和倒下来的树干。距离教堂不远的这一段水流又深又黑，从前上面架着一座木桥。一条路通到桥跟前，而路和桥都被浓荫遮盖，掩没在林木之中，即便在大白天也阴森森的，夜间更是漆黑一团、狰狞可怕了。无头骑兵最喜欢这种地方，于是这儿就成了他常来常往之地。布鲁威尔老头是不信邪，不信鬼的；据他讲述，有一次路遇无头骑兵从睡谷里跑出来，他便跟在后边穷追不舍，飞马越过荆棘和矮树，爬过山坡，穿过沼泽，最后来到了木桥跟前。此时，无头骑兵摇身一变成了一具骷髅，抓住布鲁威尔老头，一把将他抛进山涧，随后轰隆一声响，腾空而起，消失在了树林的上空。

这个故事立刻就被“布鲁姆勇士”的故事超越了，后者讲述了一段自己的亲身经历，比这个故事要惊险三倍。他把那个黑森骑兵根本不放在眼里，觉得对方只不过是个徒有虚名的骑手罢了。他口气坚定地说：一天夜里，他从邻近的辛辛村回家，这个黑森骑兵从后面赶了上来。他提出要跟对方赛马，赌一碗酒喝。他本来是可以赢的，因为“冒失鬼”可以轻而易举击败那匹幽灵马。可是，刚到教堂旁的木桥跟前，黑森骑兵便打了退堂鼓，化作一道火光不见了。

这些故事是在黑暗中讲述的，讲述人声音含糊、低沉，时不时会有人抽上一口烟袋，而烟袋的火光会将听者的脸照亮。这些故事深深地印在了伊卡博德的心上。他投桃报李，引用了自己珍视的作家科顿·马瑟书里的几大段故事讲给大家听，中间还添加了许多他的故乡康涅狄格州的灵异事件，以及他在睡谷里走夜路时看到的各种恐怖现象。

这时，前来聚会寻欢的人群渐渐散了。老农夫们呼儿唤女，让全家人坐上马车踏上归程，辘辘的马车声久久回荡在空旷的路上和远处的山间。姑娘们骑到马上，坐在意中人身后的马鞍上，开心地笑着，她们的莺声燕语和嗒嗒嗒的马蹄声混杂在一起，荡漾于宁静的山林里，渐行渐弱，乃至最后彻底消失。大厅里刚才还人声鼎沸，一片热闹的景象，一下子就人去屋空，变得静悄悄的了。伊卡博德逗留未去，因为根据本地乡村的风俗习惯，情郎临别时得和女方说几句贴心的话。此时的他已胸有成竹，觉得自己已经登上了成功的大道。至于二人之间谈得怎么样，我就不便乱说了——其实我对当时的情况一无所知。不过，从某种迹象看来情况不妙。事实上，他没过多大一会儿就跑了出来，灰溜溜的，神情沮丧。唉，女人呀，女人！女人真是叫人难以捉摸！莫非那个小女子又玩什么鬼花样啦？难道她挑逗这个可怜的学究仅仅是个激将法，实则是为了套牢他的那个情敌？这只有天知地知，我却不知！我只能说：伊卡博德垂头丧气地溜了出来，全然不像一个前来俘虏美人心的勇士，倒像是个偷鸡贼。平时他来美人家，对她家的财富垂涎欲滴，总是左看右看的，此时已没有了这份心情，而是径直走到马厩，拳打脚踢地狠狠给了他那匹马几下子，毫不体贴地把它惊醒过来，哪管它在舒适的马厩里睡得正香，哪管它正在做美梦，梦见玉米和燕麦堆成了山，山谷里遍地都是猫尾草和苜蓿。

此时已是深夜，是鬼魂出没的时间。伊卡博德心情沉重、垂头丧气地打道回府，沿着逗留镇旁高山的山腰一路走去。下午时分，他曾沿着同一条路兴冲冲而来，现在却败兴而归。茫茫的夜色和他的心情一样，也是那般凄凉。塔潘湾在山下很远的地方，水面昏暗而朦胧，一片荒凉的景象；在岸边的几处地方停泊着小船，可以看见它们那高高的桅杆。在这死沉沉的深夜里，甚至连哈德逊河对岸的狗吠声他也能听得见。不过，那声音极其模糊、微弱，让他觉得自己跟那位人类的忠实伙伴相隔甚远。偶尔会有一只公鸡从睡梦中醒来，拖长声音喔喔喔乱叫一通——那声音非常遥远，像是来自大山里的某户农家，可在他听来像是来自梦乡。偶尔还可以听见蟋蟀的一两声悲鸣，或者听见附近沼泽地那儿传来带着喉音的呱呱的蛙鸣——那青蛙像是在辗转反侧，睡得不踏实。

下午听到的那些关于妖魔鬼怪的故事，此时一下子涌进了他的脑海。夜色愈来愈黑暗，天上的星星似乎愈加遥远，偶尔飞来几朵乌云会将星星遮盖得完全看不见。他从来没有感到过如此孤单，如此凄惨。此外，他正在走近一个传说中经常闹鬼的地方。路中央有一棵巨无霸郁金香树，像一个巨灵，鹤立鸡群般站在一片树木当间，仿佛一座分界碑。这棵树的树枝扭曲多瘤、奇形怪状，每根树枝都又粗又大，相当于普通树的树干，有的弯下来几乎触着地面，有的高高伸到空中去。此树跟倒霉的安德烈那悲惨的遭遇有诸多联系，因此，乡亲们一致称它为“安德烈少校之树”。老百姓见到它，有着复杂的心绪，既敬畏又迷信，一方面同情那个与大树同名的人不幸的命运，另一方面则是受到了相关的鬼怪故事的影响——那些故事讲的是些灵异现象，凄凄惨惨，叫人伤感。

伊卡博德走近这棵可怕的大树时，便吹口哨壮胆。他觉得有人也在吹口哨作为回应——其实，那只不过是一阵风扫过干枝枯叶发出的声响。又走近一些，他觉得好像看见一样白乎乎的东西倒挂在树干那儿，吓得他不禁勒住马缰，停止了吹口哨。但定睛仔细一看，才发现那是树身遭了雷击，树皮被剥掉，露出了树皮下白白的木头。突然，他听到了一声悲叹，吓得他上下牙直打架，膝盖抖得直磕碰马鞍。其实，那只不过是在微风中，两根巨大的树枝相互摩擦产生的声音罢了。最后，他总算有惊无险地从大树旁走了过去。但是，前边还会有更多的险情出现。

离这棵树大约两百码的地方，有一条小溪横过路面，流进一个被称为“威利沼泽谷”的幽谷里，那儿是一片湿地，树木茂密。溪水上架了几根粗大的原木，作为渡水之桥。道路的另一边，在小溪流到树林里去的地方，有一丛橡树和栗树，树身上布满了密密匝匝的野葡萄藤，把那儿遮得像一个深洞，阴森森的。走过这座桥，那可是极为严峻的考验。倒霉的安德烈就是在那个地方被抓住的。想当年，那些身强力壮的义勇骑兵，就是埋伏在这些栗树和藤葛的掩蔽之下，出其不意地擒获了他。自此，这儿就被人们认作是鬼怪作祟之地，学童孤身一人走夜路经过此处，无不胆战心惊。

伊卡博德朝着溪水靠近时，一颗心像打鼓般通通乱跳。不过，他还是鼓足了全部勇气，一连对他那匹马的肋骨踢了十几下，打算飞快地冲过这座桥。可是，这个畜生耍起了犟脾气，没有听命朝前冲，而是来了一个横向动作，斜刺里冲向了树篱。这一耽搁，叫伊卡博德心里更害怕了。他将另一侧的缰绳猛地一勒，用另一只脚狠踢马肚。他再怎么样都无济于事。那匹马固然改了方向，然而却是蹿到路的另一侧，冲进一片树莓和赤杨木混为一处的杂树丛。这位教书先生又是用鞭子抽，又是用脚后跟猛磕“火药”那瘦骨嶙峋的肚皮，使得它喘着粗气、打着响鼻冲向前去，然而到了桥头却来了个猛刹车，让背上的骑手差点没一头倒栽下去。而就在此时此刻，伊卡博德灵敏的耳朵听见桥旁边的烂泥地传来踢踏踢踏的脚步声。他发现在那儿的溪水旁边，在黑魆魆的树影里有样庞然大物，奇形怪状的，赫然矗立在那边。它一动也不动，就像一个巨大的怪物，似乎在暗影里积聚力量，准备一下子扑过来袭击这个路人。

这位学究吓得魂飞魄散、毛发倒立。这该如何是好？掉头跑吧，已为时过晚。再说，要真是妖怪，它可会腾云驾雾，难道能逃出它的手心吗？于是乎，这位学究壮起胆子、鼓足勇气，结巴着问了一声：“你是何人？”对方没有回答。他又问了一声，这次的声音更为忐忑。对方仍没有回答。他见状，又一次猛踢顽固的“火药”的肚皮，一面闭上眼睛，带着一种并非自愿的热情，高唱起赞美诗。这时，那个骇人的影影绰绰的东西倏然采取了行动，一跳便跳到了路当间。虽然夜色茫茫，周围一片漆黑，那个不知来历的东西的形状基本还是可以辨得清的。那东西好像是个骑兵，身躯庞大，骑在一匹身子骨强健的黑马上。这位骑兵既没有表示恶意也没有表示善意，只是淡然地沿着道路的一侧前行，慢悠悠走在“火药”瞎眼的那一面——此时，“火药”受了惊后胡来的那股劲儿已经过去。

伊卡博德对这位半夜三更突然出现的陌生旅伴并无好感，心里想到“布鲁姆勇士”和黑森骑兵赛马的那段经历，于是便催动坐骑，打算把这位旅伴甩在后面。然而，这个陌生人也催马前行，和他保持同样的步调。伊卡博德勒一勒缰绳，让马慢下来，想让陌生人头前走，而对方也依样照搬。伊卡博德的心沉到了谷底，鼓一鼓劲，想再次高唱赞美诗，可这次嘴发干，舌头像粘在了上颚上，一句歌词也唱不出来。这个旅伴纠缠不去，阴森、固执、沉默不语，显得神秘而可怕。过了没多大一会儿，叫人毛骨悚然的谜底就揭开了。在登上一块隆起的高地时，在天空的映衬下，那个旅伴的身形趋于明朗——只见他又高又大，身披斗篷。伊卡博德发现对方竟然没有头颅，这一吓差点没被吓死！接下来的发现更叫他惊魂难定——对方那颗本应该安在肩膀上的头颅，却被他放在了身前的马鞍上！他恐惧到了极点，对“火药”脚踢和鞭抽并举，一下下雨点般落在它身上，希望一举将这位旅伴甩在身后。可是，那个妖怪也全身发力，风驰电掣地紧随其后。双方一前一后一路狂奔，哪管山高林密，所到之处只见马蹄下碎石乱飞、火星四溅。伊卡博德没命地逃窜，瘦长的身子俯下去，贴在马头上，又轻又薄的衣服迎风飞舞。

转眼，双骑已来到了转向睡谷的那条路。可是，“火药”却像中了邪，没有走这条路，却冲向相反的方向，顺山势而下，一路向左。此路穿过一条遍地黄沙的空谷，大约有四分之一英里的路处于大树的浓荫遮盖之下，在那儿要过一架小桥（此桥因出现在鬼怪故事里而闻名于世）。过了桥，是一片起伏不平的绿油油的山坡，坡顶上就是那座墙壁粉白的教堂了。

在这场追逐之中，“火药”受惊狂奔，反而叫它那骑术不佳的骑手受益匪浅。不过，在空谷里跑到半路，马鞍的肚带突然断了，伊卡博德觉得马鞍在身下慢慢溜走。他一把抓住鞍头，想将马鞍固定住，却徒劳无益。幸亏他眼明手快，抱住了“火药”的脖子，才保住了一条小命，而马鞍落地，只听咔嚓一声，被追兵踩在了马蹄下。就在这一瞬间，他的脑海里闪过了汉斯·冯·里普尔雷霆大怒的镜头——那可是汉斯星期天去做礼拜时用的马鞍呀！不过，眼下可不是为这点小事担心的时候——那个妖怪跟在后面，追得正紧呢！再说，他骑术欠佳，不知费了多少气力才没有摔下马去，时而滑向一侧，时而又滑向另一侧，有时在马背的骨峰上猛烈地颠上颠下，他真怕会把自己颠得散了架。

这时候，林中出现了一片空地，让他高兴起来，他希望教堂的那座桥就在眼前不远的地方。但见溪水里闪烁着银星的映影，微微晃动着，由此判断他没有猜错。他看到教堂的粉墙在前方的树丛里朦朦胧胧地忽隐忽现。他想起“布鲁姆勇士”跟这个妖怪赛马，就是到了这个地方，妖怪突然销声匿迹了，于是心想：“只要能跑到桥头那儿，就平安无事了。”就在这时，他听见那匹黑马赶到了身后，气喘吁吁，鼻中喷着热气——他甚至觉得那热气都喷到了自己身上。他对着“火药”的肚皮又是一阵乱踢，踢得“火药”冲到桥上，踏得桥板咚咚响，再一跃便抵达了对岸。这时候，他回过头来查看情况——按说，那个追兵会化为一团鬼火消失不见的。谁料，他却看见那个妖怪踏着马镫立起身子，提起他的头颅要朝他扔过来。

伊卡博德急忙躲闪，要躲开那可怕的抛物，但已经来不及了。那玩意儿砰的一声巨响砸在了他的脑壳上，砸得他一个倒栽葱落在了尘埃里。“火药”、黑马以及那个妖怪骑兵旋风似的从他旁边一扫而过。

次日早晨，人们发现那匹老马没有了马鞍，缰绳拖在蹄子下，在主人家的大门外悠闲地啃青草。早饭时，伊卡博德没有露面，午饭时仍不见其人。学生们来到学校里没人管，便跑到溪水旁，悠闲自在地玩耍起来，而那位教书先生迟迟不见来。汉斯·冯·里普尔这下子有点慌了神，开始为可怜的伊卡博德感到担心，也在担心他的那副马鞍。大家伙儿出发去寻找他的下落，经过艰辛的努力，终于发现了他的踪迹。在通往教堂的一段路上，他们找到了那副马鞍，发现它被踩在了烂泥里。有几行马蹄印通向桥头，在路面上陷得很深，显然是疯狂的奔跑所留下的蹄印。过了桥，有一段溪水水面较宽，此处的水又深又黑，人们在岸上找到了不幸的伊卡博德的帽子，近旁还有一个摔得稀巴烂的南瓜。

大家开始在溪水里打捞，但那位教书先生却死不见尸。汉斯·冯·里普尔以他的遗产处理人的身份，检查了他的那个包袱，里面包着他的所有财物——两件半衬衫、两条围巾、一两双羊毛袜子、一条旧的灯芯绒裤子、一把锈剃刀、一本卷边折角的赞美诗集和一只旧音笛。至于学校里的书籍和家具，那些全都是公家的，只有科顿·马瑟的那本《巫术史》、一本《新英格兰年鉴》和一本圆梦算命的书是属于伊卡博德的。列在最后的那本书里夹着一张大大的纸，纸上有几句诗，原打算是献给冯·塔塞尔家的那个女继承人的，不知抄自何处，字迹歪斜、墨迹斑斑。这些巫术书和歪诗被汉斯·冯·里普尔一把火给烧掉了。他铁下心，从今往后再也不送自己的孩子去上学了，觉得学读这样的书、写这样的诗，真不知会有什么好结果。至于说那位教书先生的钱囊，他前一两天才拿到了季薪，不管有多少，反正他失踪的时候，那些钱就在他身上。

到了星期天，人们来教堂做礼拜，对这桩神秘的事件进行了种种猜测，有的聚集于墓地里，有的到小桥边，有的则围在发现帽子和南瓜的地方，睁大眼睛细看，你一言我一语地议论纷纷。大伙儿想起布鲁威尔的遭遇，想起“布鲁姆勇士”的经历，想起种种诸如此类的事件，绞尽脑汁地进行了通盘考虑，又把它们跟这桩案子的各种迹象做了比较，最后无奈地摇摇头，断定伊卡博德是被那个黑森骑兵掳走了。鉴于伊卡博德是个单身汉，又不欠谁的钱，他的事也就没人再操心了。学校迁到了睡谷的另一个地方，另一位学究取代了他的位置。

几年之后，一个年老的农夫去纽约参观（以上所讲的鬼怪故事就是出自此人之口），返家后，带来了一个消息，说伊卡博德·克莱恩仍活着，还说伊卡博德·克莱恩当初之所以要离开这一带，一是因为他害怕那个妖怪和汉斯·冯·里普尔，二是由于突遭那位女继承人的拒绝，让他无地自容；而今，他住在一个遥远的地方，一边教学，一边学习法律，步入了律师界，从事政治，参加竞选，为报社撰稿，最终当上了十英镑法庭(14)的法官。在自己的情敌销声匿迹之后不久，“布鲁姆勇士”便得意扬扬地跟如花似玉的卡特丽娜步入了婚姻的殿堂。每当有人讲起伊卡博德的神秘失踪，他的样子就像个知情人似的，一提到那个南瓜，他便笑得肚子疼。于是，一些人便怀疑他了解内情，而他硬是不肯说出来。

然而，对于这种事情，年老的村妇们是最有发言权的，她们坚称伊卡博德是被鬼掳走了。冬天的傍晚，当地人围火而坐，这件事成了大家津津乐道的谈资。那座桥也更加引人注意，使得迷信妖怪的人敬而远之，这恐怕就是近几年让那条路改道的原因了——现在去教堂可走磨坊水塘边。那座学校没有了人气，很快就破败了，据说那个不幸的学究已化为鬼魂，经常在那儿出没。宁静的夏日傍晚时分，农夫从田中归来，常常会产生幻觉，仿佛听见远处传来他的声音，听见他用凄凉的调子在唱赞美诗，其声其调回荡在沉寂而静谧的睡谷里。





附笔


在尼克博克先生的遗稿里发现的材料

以上的故事是我到曼哈托斯古城参加一个社团会议，在会场上听人讲述的，几乎一字不差。当时与会的有许多德高望重、地位显赫的市民。讲述者是一个生性快活、样子寒酸但具有绅士风度的老头，他穿一身椒盐色衣服，脸上有一种悲凉的幽默神情（我猜度他一定是个穷人）——他讲得绘声绘色，以博众人一笑。故事讲完后，大家哈哈大笑，颇为欣赏，其中最喜欢这个故事的是两三个副市议员（这几个人开会时一直在睡觉）。不过，有个高个子老人却声色不动。此人紧锁剑眉，自始至终表情严肃，不苟言笑，时而双臂交叉，时而歪着脑袋凝视，时而低头沉思，似乎在心里思考着一个个疑点。他属于有心计的那种人，从不随便发笑捧场，除非对方有响当当的理由让他笑——该理由必须合情理、合逻辑。待全场的人笑声消退，人们都静下来的时候，只见他把一个胳膊肘架在椅子扶手上，另一只手叉腰，脑袋很有分寸地微微一斜，发出了疑问：这个故事有何意义？想说明什么问题？

讲述者刚把酒杯举到嘴边，想喝口酒润润焦渴的喉咙，一听问话便停了下来，用充满敬意的目光看了一眼提问者，然后将酒杯又慢慢地放回到了桌子上，解释说本故事是想以严密的逻辑性证明——

“人生并非处处有笑声，处处有欢乐——我们只需讲个笑话，就会有笑声，就会有欢乐；

“因此，故事的主人公跟鬼骑兵赛马，那就叫他遭遇许多波折和磨难。

“于是，乡村教师被荷兰裔女继承人拒绝，象征了向国家的高度发展迈出了一步。”

那位不苟言笑的老先生听得一头雾水，被这种三段论的推理法搞得完全糊涂了，于是便将眉头皱得更紧了。身穿椒盐色衣服的讲述者用眼睛盯着他，露出几分得意的神情。末了，老先生说故事倒是挺好的，只是他觉得有点夸张，而且他心里仍有一两处疑点。

“实不相瞒，先生，”讲述者说道，“对于这个故事的真实性，我自己也是不太相信的。”

魔鬼和汤姆·沃克


在马萨诸塞州，距离波士顿几英里的地方，有一个深水湾，从查尔斯湾开始延伸，弯弯曲曲插入内陆长达数英里，断头处是一个密密麻麻长满了树的沼泽（或称泥地）。水湾的一侧有一片美丽的林子，林子里光线暗淡；在对面的一侧，临水矗立着一座陡峭的山岗，山岗上稀稀拉拉长着几棵高龄橡树，一棵棵像巨无霸似的。根据古老的传说，海盗基德把他的财宝埋在了其中一棵树下。该水湾便于航行，夜间用小船便可神不知鬼不觉地将钱财运抵山脚下。山岗地势高，可以从那儿观察周围的动静，而橡树高大，是很好的地标，回头寻找财宝时极为便当。此外，这个古老的传说中还提到：埋财宝事宜由魔鬼主持，之后亦由它负责看管。众所周知，埋藏财物的事情向来都是由魔鬼经管的，尤其不义之财更是如此。不过不管怎么样，基德却一直没有回来取他的宝藏，因为他在波士顿被抓住，不久之后便被送到英国，以海盗罪绞死了。

大约是在一七二七年，新英格兰地震频仍，吓得许多不可一世的罪孽深重之人都跪了下来祈求宽恕。这儿附近住着一个窝窝囊囊的小气鬼，名叫汤姆·沃克。他妻子跟他一样也吝啬成性，因为两口子都是守财奴，甚至彼此反目，相互欺骗。这女人见什么都会拿走藏起来；母鸡下蛋，鸡蛋还没下出来，她就虎视眈眈地守在那儿准备抢走。她丈夫则总是东找西寻，想把她藏的东西找出来。对于哪些东西是公共财产，两口子没少吵架，一吵就吵得脸红脖子粗。他们住的房子气氛凄凉，孤零零的，像是饿鬼的住所。门外长着几棵萎靡不振的柏树，成了寒酸的标志。烟囱里不见冒炊烟，不见过路人留步于门前。他们家的地里到处是乱石，坑洼不平，地面上结了些青苔，薄得连石头都盖不住；一匹可怜兮兮的马儿在地里乱转，吃几口青苔，反而更加饥饿难耐；有时候，它会把头探出栅栏，可怜巴巴地望着从跟前经过的人，似乎在央求他们把它从这块闹饥荒的地里救出去。

这栋房子与这户人家都臭名在外。汤姆之妻是个泼妇，人高马大、性情暴躁、粗喉咙大嗓门，胳膊力大无穷。她跟丈夫吵起嘴来，常常只听得到她的声音。有时候，丈夫的脸上会出现伤痕，证明他们之间的冲突已经不仅仅是语言的交锋了。然而，竟无人敢出面劝架。谁要是独自一人从这儿走过，见了这恶言恶语、拳脚相加的场面，一定会心生畏惧，一边斜着眼看着这个缺乏和谐的人家，一边加快步子匆匆而过；如果是个单身汉，那他会庆幸自己幸亏没有老婆。

一天，汤姆·沃克到该地区一个比较远的地方去，返回时走的是沼泽地——他认为走那儿是条捷径。跟大多数捷径一样，凡是快捷之路，必不好走。沼泽地里密密匝匝到处是树，有松树也有铁杉树，那些树又高又大，阴森森的，有的足有九十英尺高，林中即便在正午时分也黑黢黢的，是附近一带猫头鹰的栖息之地。此处遍布水坑和泥潭，有些区域则杂草丛生、青苔铺地。绿色的地面常常会骗住行路人的眼睛，使得他会一脚踏入黑泥潭里窒息而亡。这儿还有许多黑乎乎的、污浊的池塘，成为蝌蚪、牛蛙以及水蛇的家园。松树和铁杉的树干半泡在水里，一半已腐烂，看上去就像睡在泥坑里的鳄鱼一样。

穿过这座险恶的林子，汤姆小心翼翼地择路而行，走啊走，走了许久。深深的泥沼里有着一丛丛的灯芯草和树根可以充当落脚点，但这样的落脚点极其危险，他踏上去时总是提心吊胆。有时，他又会像猫似的，沿着倒下来的树干谨慎前行；时不时会有一只鸬鹚突然尖叫一声，或者一只野鸭呱呱一声长鸣，从荒凉的池塘里飞起，弄得他吃惊不小。最终，他总算踏上了一块结实的土地，此处像个半岛，深入沼泽的腹地。想当年，印第安人同第一批殖民者交战，这儿曾是他们的一个据点。在此，他们建起了一种堡垒，自以为几乎牢不可破，于是便将这儿作为他们妻儿老小的避难所。如今，印第安人的那座堡垒只剩下了几段残垣断壁，而这些残垣和断壁也在逐渐消失，变得跟周围的土地一样平，几处已长满了橡树和其他的树木——这些树木的枝叶跟沼泽里的那些阴森的松树及铁杉树形成了鲜明的对比。

汤姆·沃克走到这座古老的堡垒时，已是暮色苍茫。他留住脚步，想休息休息。除了他，换上谁也不会愿意在这荒凉凄惨的地方歇脚的。跟印第安人打仗时流传下来一些故事，于是一般人都将此处视为不祥之地。据说，那些野蛮人曾经在这儿行法念咒，曾用活人祭祀恶鬼。然而，汤姆·沃克却不信邪，根本不害怕这样的故事。他坐在一棵倒下来的铁杉树树干上休息了一会儿，一边听着蟾蜍那不祥的叫声，一边用手杖向脚边的一堆黑土里捅了捅。他下意识地用手杖将土翻起，谁知手杖碰到了一样硬硬的东西。随即，他把那东西从那堆腐殖土里挖了出来。老天爷，面前的那玩意儿竟然是个裂开的人的头骨，头骨里深深嵌着一把印第安战斧！战斧锈迹斑斑，看得出这致命的一击发生在很久以前。这是一件悲惨的纪念品，纪念这印第安武士的最后据点曾发生过的那场惨烈的战斗。

“哼！” 汤姆·沃克鼻子哼了一声，照着头骨踢了一脚，想把上面的泥土踢掉。

“别碰那头骨！”一个瓮声瓮气的声音说。

汤姆抬起头来，看见一个黑铁塔般的汉子坐在他正对面的树桩上。他惊讶万分，因为他压根就没有看见有人走过来，也没听见过脚步声呀。而更叫他困惑的是：在越来越浓的暮色里，他发现这个陌生人既不是黑人也不是印第安人。此人身穿半印第安式的粗布衣服，腰间系一条红皮带（或布带），一张脸既不是纯黑色的，亦不是古铜色，他的那种黑像是用烟熏过、炭涂过，仿佛长年劳作于打铁炉和熔炉旁造成的。他的头发又黑又粗，乱蓬蓬的，全都竖起来，肩上扛着一把斧头。只见他皱起眉头，瞪圆那双发红的大眼睛，将汤姆打量了一番，然后用瓮声瓮气的粗哑的声音喝问：“你来我的地面有何贵干？”

“你的地面？”汤姆冷笑了一声说，“这地方不属于你，也不属于我，而是属于教堂执事皮博迪。”

“就让教堂执事皮博迪下地狱去吧。”陌生人说，“如果他不多想想自己的罪孽，不对周围的人宽容一些，我敢肯定他终究会有那么一天的。你瞧瞧那边，就知道他会有什么样的结局了。”

汤姆顺着陌生人手指的方向望去，看见了一棵大树——那大树外表枝繁叶茂，漂漂亮亮，但树心已经腐烂，几乎被拦腰砍断，来一阵狂风很可能就会将其刮倒。树皮上刻着教堂执事皮博迪的名字。该执事地位显赫，跟印第安人做买卖很刻薄，发了大财。汤姆环顾四周，发现那些高树上大多都刻着殖民时期某个伟人的名字，多多少少都被斧头砍过，均带有斧痕。他屁股底下坐的这棵树显然刚被砍倒不久，上面刻着克劳宁希尔德的名字。他想起这是一个富翁的名字，此人富得流油，经常俗不可耐地炫耀他的财富，而人们却背地里说他的钱是当海盗抢来的。

“他就要被当柴烧了！”黑汉一面说，一面得意地哼了一声，“你看得到，这儿柴源丰盛，够冬天烧的了。”

“这是教堂执事皮博迪的树木，你有什么权利砍倒己用？”汤姆问。

“我有的是优先权，”对方说，“你们白种人未来之前，这片林子是属于我的。”

“恕我斗胆问一声，你究竟是何人？”汤姆说道。

“我嘛，名字多着呢。有的地方叫我‘野猎人’，有的地方叫我‘黑矿工’，而这一带叫我‘黑樵夫’。 红种人把这块地方献给了我，为了对我表示尊敬，过去每隔一段时间就会把一个白人烤熟，作为香喷喷的祭品让我吃。自从红种人被你们这些白种野蛮人赶尽杀绝之后，我无以消遣，便主导对教友会和再浸礼会教徒的迫害，从中取乐；此外，我是奴隶贩子大赞助商和促进者，也是塞勒姆女巫的大主管(1)。”

“说来说去，如果我没猜错的话，你恐怕就是人们所传的恶魔喽。”汤姆不卑不亢地说。

“一点不错，愿意听你吩咐！”黑汉一面回答，一面彬彬有礼地微微点了点头。

按照古老的传说，他们的会见就是这样开始的，只是太亲热了些，令人难以相信。有人会觉得，在这么一个荒凉偏僻的地方，冷不丁碰上个怪人，无论谁都会被吓得魂不附体。岂不知汤姆却是个胆壮的硬汉，和母老虎妻子在一个房檐下生活多年，甚至见了魔鬼也不害怕了。

据说，在这么一番开场白之后，黑汉一边送他回家，一边和他长谈，很是热情。黑汉告诉他海盗基德曾在离沼泽不远的那高高的山岗上埋了许多财宝，就埋在那些橡树底下。那些财宝全归他支配和保护，他看不上眼的人，谁都别想找得到。由于对汤姆特别有好感，他愿意让汤姆得到这些财宝，但必须叫汤姆答应几个条件。究竟是什么条件，汤姆虽然从来也没有公开透露过，却不难猜得出。反正条件一定是很苛刻的，因为汤姆要求考虑一段时间再作答复。按说，在有钱可赚的时候，他对小事是不会斤斤计较的。他们俩走到沼泽的边上，陌生人收住了脚步。

“用什么来证明你说的是实情呢？”汤姆问。

“我在这儿按个手印为证吧。”黑汉说着，用手指在汤姆的额头上点了一下，然后转身回到了沼泽的树丛当中。据汤姆回忆说，眼见得他一点一点朝地里沉去，后来只能看得见头和肩膀，最终便消失得无影无踪了。

汤姆回到家里，发自己前额上有个黑指头印子，好像是烙上去的，无论用什么东西都擦不掉。

妻子一见他就告诉他一条消息，说那个富得流油的海盗阿布萨龙·克劳宁希尔德突然死了。报纸上已有讣告，用的仍是那种冠冕堂皇的词：“在上帝的子民中，一个伟大的人物倒下去了。”

这让汤姆想起了黑汉刚刚砍倒的那棵树，说是要当柴禾烧掉的。于是他便对妻子说：“就让那海盗化为灰烬吧，管他呢！”现在，他已经完全相信自己所听到的话以及所看到的情况并非幻想出来的。

按说，他是不愿意向妻子敞开心扉、说出心里话的，但这个秘密搅得他不得安宁，于是也就乐得跟她分享了。妻子一听说有藏宝，立刻就泛起了满肚子的贪欲，劝说丈夫答应黑汉的条件，把那些可以叫他们阔气一辈子的东西弄到手。汤姆也许愿意把自己出卖给魔鬼，但不愿意顺从妻子的意愿，于是便反其道而行之，断然拒绝那样做。二人为此争吵不休，每次吵得都不可开交。但妻子越吵，汤姆的意志越坚定，觉得决不能叫她得逞。

最后，妻子决定亲自出马促成这笔交易，如果成功，所有的财宝都归她一人独享。她和丈夫一样，也是个天不怕地不怕的主儿，于是在一个夏日的黄昏便动身到那座古老的印第安堡垒去了。这一去就去了好几个小时。待她回到家中，少言寡语，回话时一副闷闷不乐的样子。她说自己在暮色里遇见一个黑汉，那黑汉正在用斧头砍一棵大树的树根。对方满脸的不高兴，不愿意跟她谈条件；她还得再去一趟，这次去要带些见面礼，但具体是什么见面礼她却不肯说。

次日黄昏，她又到沼泽地里去了，围裙里包了一些沉甸甸的东西。汤姆等了又等，总是不见她回来，到了半夜，仍不见她的影子。第二天，早晨、中午和夜晚过去了，她仍没有归来。汤姆渐渐为她的安全感到有点担心，等他发现她用围裙把银茶壶、银匙子和一切细软值钱的东西都包了去的时候，心里便更加不安了。又过了一夜，又到了早晨，仍不见妻子返家。总而言之，她如泥牛入海，一去便没有了音讯。

至于她遭遇到了什么样的命运，虽然许多人声称自己了解内情，其实无人知道。历史学家们各抒己见、众说纷纭，把这件事搅成了一团乱麻。有的说她走进迷宫一样的沼泽地里，顿时迷失了方向，最后陷进水坑或泥潭里丧了命；有的则更加无情，说她带着家里的细软远走高飞，到别的省份享清福去了；有的说魔鬼迷了她的心窍，骗得她陷进了泥沼，人们在泥沼上发现了她的帽子可以作为证据。事实胜于雄辩——据说，在那天的黄昏时分，有人看见一个黑铁塔般的汉子肩扛利斧从沼泽地里走了出来，手中提着个包成包袱的格子花布围裙，得意扬扬的，一脸的邪气。

不过，最流行的也最可信的说法是：汤姆·沃克当时既为妻子感到担心，又为那些细软牵肠挂肚，最后只好出发前去印第安堡垒看个究竟。夏日的下午比较长，他就在那个阴森森的地方四处寻找，但一无所获。他喊着妻子的名字，一声又一声，然而听不见妻子的回应声。回答他的只有飞过的鸬鹚那凄厉的的叫声，或者牛蛙从附近池塘里传来的悲哀的呱呱声。据说，到了最后，在一片苍茫的暮色里，猫头鹰开始怪叫，蝙蝠飞来飞去，他的注意力突然被一群专吃腐肉的乌鸦吸引了去，只见那群乌鸦哇哇叫着在一棵柏树的上空盘旋。他定睛一瞧，看见一个格子花布包袱吊在树枝上面，近旁有一只巨大无比的秃鹫，似乎在看管那个包袱。他认出那是妻子的围裙，断定家里的细软就包在里面，于是高兴得跳了起来。

“先把东西拿到手再说，”他欣慰地自言自语道，“没有那女人照样能过日子。”

他噌噌地爬上树，而那只秃鹫展开巨大的翅膀，尖叫一声飞向了阴影幢幢的密林深处。他一把抓住那个格子花布包袱，打开一看却惊呆了——里面什么也没有，只有一颗心和一个肝脏！

根据最可信的说法，汤姆的妻子不见了，只剩下了这些。她很可能做过尝试，想用通常对付丈夫的那一套对付黑汉。一般人都认为一个恶女人敌得过魔鬼，然而在这次争锋中，此女似乎大祸临头了。她一定是经过殊死搏斗才不幸遇难的——据说，汤姆在大树跟前发现了许多深深的脚印和一把一把又粗又黑的头发，看样子那头发是从黑樵夫头上抓下来的。通过实践，汤姆深知妻子的神力。见了这又抓又掐短兵相接的惨烈搏斗留下的痕迹，他不禁耸了耸肩膀，叹一声：“哎哟哟，魔鬼准是吃了不少苦头！”

汤姆虽然痛失家中细软，但妻子的死却给了他一些安慰。他毕竟是个豁达的人，甚至对那个黑樵夫还有几分感激呢，觉得黑樵夫为他做了件好事。于是，他想把自己跟黑樵夫的交情深化深化，可他千找万找都找不到对方。那个黑鬼倒是非常谨慎的，不管别人怎么想，反正他可不是想见就能见的主儿。他善于把握时机，知道怎么出牌。

据说，最后由于迟迟找不到黑樵夫，汤姆焦躁到了极点，决定不管什么条件都会答应，只要能把那笔财宝拿到手即可。就在这时，在一天黄昏时分，他和黑樵夫不期而遇了——对方仍是樵夫打扮，肩扛利斧，在沼泽边转悠，嘴里哼着小调。他见了汤姆，对汤姆表现出的热情反应冷淡，爱答不理地回着话，一边继续哼着小调。

不过，汤姆渐渐引得他谈起了正事，二人针对协助汤姆弄到海盗财宝的条件进行了讨价还价。其中有一个条件是无须说的，因为大家都知道，凡是遇到魔鬼施恩于人，都会有这么一条。然而还有其他的一些条件，虽不那么重要，黑汉却坚决不肯让步。他认为：他帮助汤姆弄到钱财，那么，这笔钱财就得为他服务。因而，他提出让汤姆把钱用于贩奴，具体说，就是用这笔钱备办一条运黑奴的轮船。而汤姆却予以斩钉截铁的拒绝。他固然是个十恶不赦的坏蛋，但就连魔鬼也别指望诱使他染指于贩奴。

鹰鬼见汤姆在这一点上寸步不让，也就不再坚持了，接着便提出了一个代替的方案——让汤姆成为一个放高利贷的人。魔鬼急于招募放高利贷的人，将其视为自己特殊的人才。

对于这项提议，汤姆没有反对，因为这正中他的下怀。

“你下个月就在波土顿开一家交易店铺。”黑汉说。

“如果你愿意，我明天就开。”汤姆·沃克说。

“放贷出去，月息二分利。”

“哎呀，我要收四分利！”汤姆·沃克说。

“你要把那些商人的债券拿到手里，取消他们赎回抵押品的权利，逼得他们倾家荡产……”

“我要逼得他们下地狱！” 汤姆·沃克迫不及待地叫嚷道。

“为我放贷，你可真是个理想人才！”黑汉充满喜悦地说，“什么时候把那笔钱财交给你？”

“就在今晚。”

“一言为定！”魔鬼说。

“一言为定！”汤姆·沃克说。

接下来，二人握手，这笔生意就算成交了。

几天后，汤姆·沃克在波士顿开了家钱庄，自己当了掌柜。他手中有现钱，谁肯付高利息，他就借给谁，于是名声鹊起，而这消息不胫而走。贝尔彻总督(2)执政时期现金奇缺，至今人们对当时的情况仍记忆犹新。那时候，各种票据满天飞，政府发行的债券泛滥成灾。闻名于天下的“土地银行”就是在那时成立的。当时，投机的浪潮一浪高过一浪；人们发了疯似的开拓新移民区，在荒野里建城镇；地皮经纪人手拿绘制着租地、城镇及“黄金国”(3)的地图，四处兜揽生意——谁都不知道地图上的那些地方究竟在何处，但人人都愿意花钱购买。简而言之，投机的热潮此起彼伏，每隔一段时间就爆发一次，其热度达到了叫人瞠目的地步——人人都想白手起家，人人都想一夜致富。照例，一旦高烧消退，美梦破灭，幻想中的钱财化为泡影，发高烧的病人便会陷入悲惨的境地，四面八方都有人在哀叹：“世道难呀！”

就在这群情沮丧的大吉大利之时，汤姆·沃克在波士顿做起了高利贷的生意。很快，顾客便纷至沓来。其中有急需用钱、不惜冒险的人，有孤注一掷的投机商，有怀揣梦想的地皮经纪人，有不知节省的小商贩，有贷款无门的生意人——一句话，凡是走投无路、不惜任何代价都需要借钱的人，纷纷找上门来向汤姆·沃克借贷。

于是，汤姆就成了落难人公认的朋友，行为举止上也是一副“患难之交”的样子。话又说回来，他历来要求对方付出高额的利息和可观的保证金。申请人的灾难愈是深重，他的条件也就愈加苛刻。他敛聚了许多债券和许多抵押品，一点点把顾客的油全部榨干，干得就像被挤干了水的海绵，最后将他们一脚踢开。马车行驶时，由于不给车轴上油，车轮会咯吱咯吱呻吟个不停，你听了准会以为那是受他压榨的可怜的负债人的灵魂在哀号。

可是，等到汤姆老了以后，心事也逐渐重了。在现世，金银财宝都有了，他开始为来世发愁。想起自己跟黑汉朋友定下的交易条件，他便后悔不已，处心积虑想哄一哄黑汉，不去履行那些条件。于是乎，他突然间变成了一个热心上教堂做礼拜的人。祷告时，他大嗓门、高音量，仿佛要靠肺部的力量才能进天堂似的。实际上，你只要听他在哪个星期天祈祷时声音最高，就可以由此判断他这一星期造的孽最深。那些不声不响、一直在谦逊而坚定地走向天国的基督徒，看到自己竟然在这条路上，被这位新近皈依的教徒领了先，不由倍加自责。汤姆对待宗教，像对待钱财一样一丝不苟。他严厉地监督着邻居，动辄便严加斥责，似乎给邻人的账本上记一项罪名，就可以转化为他自己功劳簿上的一桩功德似的。他甚至主张恢复对教友会和再浸礼会教徒的迫害。总之，他对宗教的热忱变得和他的财富一样出了名。

不过，尽管汤姆异常注重宗教形式，内心却担惊受怕，唯恐魔鬼到底还是会找上门算账的。据说，为了避免魔鬼趁他冷不防将他抓走，他就在外套口袋里常备一本小开本《圣经》，还在钱庄的柜台上放一本巨大的对开本的《圣经》——上门的顾客常见他诵经不止。见有人来，他会摘下绿颜色的眼镜放在书上，作为读到那里的标记，然后转过身来洽谈高利贷生意。

有些人说，汤姆暮年时有点精神错乱，幻想着自己的末日即将来临，叫人给他的马换了新马掌，备了马鞍，拴了缰绳，然后把它四蹄朝天活埋掉，因为他认为到了末日，这个世界会颠倒过来。这样，他就会发现他那匹马直端端站立在那儿，让他随时都可以骑走。他打定主意，要在最糟糕的情况出现时一跑了之，远离他的那位老朋友。不过，这很可能只不过是老太太们的闲聊罢了。他要是真的采取了这样的预防措施，那完全是多此一举。最起码，那个可信的古老传说所讲的情况并非如此，而是以如下方式结束他的人生经历的：

那是一个热得要死的季节，在一个热烘烘的下午，黑云压顶，狂风暴雨眼看就要来临。汤姆头戴白纱帽，身穿印度丝绸晨衣，端坐于钱庄。当时， 他正要取消一个倒霉的土地投机商人赎回抵押品的权利。他口口声声说自己跟这位投机商交情很厚，而此时的目的却是要叫对方彻底破产。那个地皮经纪人苦苦哀求，让他宽限几个月，这一下惹恼了汤姆，使得他气不打一处来，声称连一天也不宽限。

“这会叫我倾家荡产，到济贫院靠施舍过日子的。”地皮经纪人说。

“慈悲要从自家开始，”汤姆回答道，“世道艰难，我得先照料好自己呀。”

“你从我身上已经赚了不少钱了。”那位投机商说。

汤姆耐不住性子，连平时装出的虔诚教徒的面子也不顾了，说道：“我要是赚过你一分钱，那就让魔鬼把我抓走好啦！”

他话音刚落，就听见临街的大门有人叩了三下，声音很大。他走出去看是什么人，只见那个黑汉站在门外，手里牵着一匹黑马，那黑马嘶鸣不已，焦躁得四蹄乱跳。

“汤姆，我今天来是来找你的！”黑汉粗声粗气地说。

汤姆急缩身想溜走，但为时已晚。小本《圣经》被他忘在外套口袋里了，而那个大本的《圣经》丢在了柜台上，就放在他正要勾销的抵押凭证的下面。没有哪个罪人比他更狼狈了，在完全没有防备的情况下被魔鬼抓了个正着。只见那黑汉像老鹰抓小鸡一样把他拎起来放在马鞍上，狠狠抽了马一鞭子，于是那马便驮着汤姆，冒着雷雨疾驰而去。钱庄的雇员们耳朵后夹着铅笔，一个个目瞪口呆地从窗户那儿望着他的背影。汤姆·沃克走了，骑着马在大街上飞奔，白帽子上下一颠一颠的，晨衣迎风飘荡，坐下骑风驰电掣，每跳跃一下，路面就会溅起一些火星。待雇员们再去看黑汉，他早已不见了踪影。

汤姆·沃克再也没有回来勾销那张抵押凭证。有个住在沼泽旁边的乡下人后来谈起这事，说那天雷雨下得正猛的时候，他听见大路那边传来震天动地的马蹄声和人的哀号声。他跑到窗前，看到一个人骑在马上发疯似的在野外狂奔，一如我刚才描述的那样，翻过山丘，一头钻进黑黢黢的长满了铁杉树的沼泽地，朝着那个古老的印第安堡垒冲去。随即，那个方向亮起一道闪电，似乎让整个林子都燃起了熊熊大火。

波士顿的老百姓听了只是摇摇头、耸耸肩，并没有像普通人所想象的那样恐慌，因为自从殖民时期第一批移民来到此处起，便有各种关于巫婆、妖怪以及千变万化的魔鬼的传说，人们早已见怪不怪了。他们立刻委托了几个人料理汤姆的财产。可是，他所有的财产都化为了乌有，不需要人料理了。他们检查他的保险箱，发现里面所有的债券和抵押凭证都成了灰烬；铁箱子里装的金条银锭变成了碎木片和刨花；马厩里两匹饿得半死的马成了两具骷髅。就在第二天，他家偌大的府邸陷于一片火海之中，被烧成了废墟。

*　*　*

汤姆·沃克和他的不义之财最后落得了这个下场。希望贪财者将这个故事记在心里，以此为训。此故事的真实性不容怀疑。汤姆·沃克从橡树底下掘出基德的财宝，所留下的那个坑至今仍可以看得见。在狂风暴雨的夜晚，经常有一道骑在马背上的鬼影出没于临近的沼泽以及那个古老的印第安堡垒，那鬼影身穿晨衣、头戴白帽——毫无疑问，这是那个高利贷商人的灵魂得不到安宁，跑出来作祟。实际上，这个故事已经变成一句俗语，即“魔鬼和汤姆·沃克”，广泛流传于新英格兰。

阿拉伯占星家的传说


古时候，在好几百年以前，有一位名叫阿本·哈布兹的摩尔王统治着格拉纳达(1)王国。他是个有退隐之心的征服者——这就是说，他年轻时攻城略地、掳掠抢夺，如今年老体衰、意志薄弱，“渴望过安宁的日子”，别无所求，只求与别的国家和平共处，保持住自己的荣誉，安安稳稳地享受从邻国掠夺来的财物。

但事不凑巧，就这么一个极端通情达理、爱好和平的老国王，却偏偏要对付一些年轻气盛的敌手——那些年轻的王侯跟他从前一样好名、好战，一心要找他算账，了结他和他们父辈之间的恩怨。他精力旺盛的时候，曾用高压手段对付国内的一些边远地区，现在他渴望过安宁的日子，那些地区却起来造反，声称要将他围困在都城，使他成为瓮中之鳖。此时的他四面受敌。格拉纳达的周围净是险峻的荒山野岭，易于掩蔽敌军的动向，于是这位不幸的阿本·哈布兹国王时时都提心吊胆，真不知敌人会从哪儿突然冒出来。

他在各山头都建有瞭望塔，各隘口都派兵把守，命令一旦敌军出现就报警——夜间燃火，白日放烟，但这些终归是徒劳。他的敌人诡计多端，让他所有的防范措施一一落空，往往会从他意想不到的山谷里钻出来，就在他的眼皮底下蹂躏他的国土，然后带着俘虏和财物返回群山里。这个渴望安宁、意欲退隐的征服者处境极为艰难，如坐针毡。

正当阿本·哈布兹不胜其扰，被敌军的进犯搅得焦头烂额的时候，一位年老的阿拉伯术士飘然而至，来到了他的王宫里。他的白胡子一直垂至腰间，处处看得出他已是古稀高龄，而他却是一路从埃及走来，几乎未乘任何车马，仅靠一根刻着象形文字的手杖助他行路。他人未至，大名早已传到。此人名叫伊伯拉西姆·伊本·阿布·阿尤伯；据说当穆罕默德(2)在世的时候，就有他了；身为阿布·阿尤伯之子，他是先知最后的一个侍从。童年时，他曾随着阿姆鲁(3)的讨伐军进驻埃及，在埃及居住多年，跟着埃及祭司学习巫术，尤其是研习魔法。

另外，据说他还发现了长寿的秘诀，一直活到现在，已有两百多岁的高龄。不过，长寿的秘决是他在暮年时才发现的，于是，灰白头发和皱纹便保留了下来。

国王给了这位年老的奇人很高的礼遇，这位国王跟大多数衰老的帝王一样，十分宠信术士，想让他住在王宫里。然而，这位占星家却宁愿住在格拉纳达城近旁山坡上的一个岩洞里，也就是后来建了阿尔罕布拉宫(4)的山上。他叫人扩建岩洞，使之成为一个宽宽敞敞、气势宏伟的大厅，顶部开一个圆孔，像井口一般，可以从那儿观察天象，甚至在正午也能够望得见星辰。大厅的墙上刻满了埃及的象形文字、神秘的符号和星座图。他亲自指导格拉纳达的能工巧匠制作了许多仪器放置在大厅里，而这些仪器的神秘功能只有他一人知晓。

过了没多久，智者伊伯拉西姆就成了国王的心腹顾问，每逢有什么紧急情况，国王便向他请教。一次，阿本·哈布兹痛斥他的邻邦，说他们公理难容，哀叹自己被搅得日夜难安，必须时刻保持警惕，以防受到入侵。等他说完之后，占星家半天没言语，过了一会儿才回话说：“启奏陛下，我在埃及的时候，曾见过一种奇异的神器，是古代的一个女祭司发明的。波尔沙城附近有座山，从山顶可以俯瞰尼罗河大峡谷，山顶上有一只公羊，公羊的背上站着只公鸡，羊和鸡都是铜铸的，安在一根轴上，可以转动。一旦国家受到威胁，有敌来犯，公羊便会转过头，朝着敌军出现的方向，而公鸡则会啼叫。由此，城里的居民就会知道有险情出现，而且知道险情来自哪个方向，这样就能及时采取防范措施。”

“真主在上！”一心想过安静日子的阿本·哈布兹不由高声说道，“如果有一只这样的公羊为我观察周围群山里的动静，再有一只这样的公鸡遇到险情就啼叫，那可真是无价之宝呀！真主至大！有这样的哨兵在山顶站岗放哨，我在王宫里便可以高枕无忧了！”

占星家等到国王的狂热劲儿过去之后，才又继续说道：

“在战无不胜的阿姆鲁（愿他的英灵安息！）征服了埃及之后，我就留了下来，跟着他们的祭司熟悉他们的偶像崇拜，研习其中的规则和仪式，为的是能够掌握他们那举世闻名的神秘知识。一天，我坐在尼罗河边和一位年老的祭司聊天，他指着附近沙漠上那些似巍巍高山一般耸立的宏伟的金字塔，说道：‘许多知识都埋藏在那些金字塔里，与之相比，我们所能传授给你的知识便是小巫见大巫了。当中的那座金字塔里有一间墓室，而当初协助建造这座雄伟金字塔的那位祭司的木乃伊就安息在那里；和他葬在一起的还有一本神奇的书，书里包罗万象，涵盖了所有魔法和巫术的秘密。此书是天书，是亚当被贬到人间时带来的，后来代代相传，传到了智慧王所罗门的手里，所罗门按照此书的指点建起了耶路撒冷神庙。至于它怎么会落到造金字塔的那个人手里，那就只有无所不知的上天知道了。’

“听了那个埃及祭司的一席话，当时我心里升腾起一团火，一心想把那本书搞到手。征伐军里的许多士兵和许多埃及的本地人，我是可以指挥得动的。于是我说干就干，指挥他们凿穿金字塔上的坚硬石块，费尽千辛万苦，进入金字塔的内部，在那儿发现了一条秘密甬道。沿着甬道一路向前，穿过一个可怕的迷宫，我终于深入到了金字塔的中心，而且找到了那个墓室——那个大祭司的木乃伊在那儿安息了不知有多少个年头了。我破开棺椁，解开木乃伊身上那一层层的包布和绷带，终于从他怀里找到了那本宝书。我用颤抖的手一把抓起书，一路摸索着到了金字塔外面，把那个木乃伊丢在黑暗的墓室里，让他在那儿等着末日的复活和最后审判。”

“阿布·阿尤伯之子呀，”阿本·哈布兹嚷嚷道，“你是个伟大的旅行家，见到过不少奇异的现象。可是，无论是金字塔的秘密，还是智慧所罗门王的那本天书，对我又有什么用呢？”

“对你是有用的，国王陛下！正是研究了那本书，我掌握了魔法，能够遣神使鬼，让他们为我所用。我还了解了波尔沙城那个神器的秘诀，不仅能造出同样的神器，而且能造出威力更大的。”

“大智大慧的阿布·阿尤伯之子呀，”阿本·哈布兹高声叫道，“有这样的神器，远胜于山顶上的瞭望塔以及边境上的哨兵。快快为我建起这样的安全保障吧，国库里的财富供你随便使用。”

占星家立刻动手造神器，以满足这位君主的愿望。他先叫人在阿尔贝辛山的山脊上的那座王宫的顶上建起一座巨大的瞭望塔。该塔用的是埃及运来的石料，据说是从一个金字塔上拆下来的。瞭望塔的上部是一个圆形大厅，四周按照罗盘所指的每个方位，开了许多窗户，每个窗口前都有一张桌子，桌上摆着一队木头雕的人马和主管这个方向的一位指挥官的木头塑像，像棋盘上那样排兵布阵。每张桌子上放着一支小矛，只有锥子那么大，上面刻着某种文字。这座大厅有一扇铜门，还有一把很大的钢锁，经常是锁起来的，钥匙由国王本人掌握。

塔顶上有一个摩尔骑士的铜像，安在一个转轴上，一只胳膊上架着个盾牌，手中的长矛呈垂直状。骑士面朝城里，似乎在保卫着这座城市。不过，一旦有敌人来犯，他便会转过身面向敌方，将长矛端平，呈冲锋状。

这件神器建成之后，阿本·哈布兹迫不及待地想试试它的威力。以前，敌人来犯，渴望安宁的他会唉声叹气，而现在他却急切盼望敌人的进犯。没多久，他的愿望就成真了。一天清晨，奉命看守瞭望塔的哨兵前来报告，说铜骑士的脸转向了埃尔维拉山，他的长矛笔直指向洛浦隘口。

“快去传令擂鼓和吹号，准备打仗，让格拉纳达全城的居民都保持警惕。”阿本·哈布兹说。

“启禀国王陛下，”占星家说，“不必惊动城里的人，也不必命令你的武士们准备战斗，咱们不必动武就可以退敌。叫侍从们都下去吧，咱们俩独自到瞭望塔的秘密大厅里去就可以了。”

年迈的阿本·哈布兹在比他年纪更大的伊伯拉西姆·伊本·阿布·阿尤伯的搀扶下，一步一步登上瞭望塔的阶梯，用钥匙打开那扇铜门，走了进去。只见面对洛浦隘口的那扇窗户敞开着。占星家说：“那儿就是险情出现的方向。请你到跟前去，国王陛下，看一看那张桌子上的秘密吧。”

阿本·哈布兹国王走到那张摆着许多小木偶的棋盘一样的桌子跟前，不由惊呆了——他发现那些小木偶全都在动。那些小木马欢腾跳跃，武士们则挥枪舞剑，隐隐约约听得到鼓号声、叮叮当当的刀剑声以及战马的嘶鸣。不过，那一片喧嚣之声，就跟一个人夏日的中午躺在阴凉地里纳凉，昏昏欲睡时耳朵里听到的蜜蜂或苍蝇的嗡嗡声差不多，微弱而模糊。

“启禀陛下，”占星家说，“这证明敌军已进入了战场。他们一定是穿过洛浦隘口，翻越群山过来的。如果你愿意在他们之间制造一些恐慌和混乱，让他们退兵，但又不造成他们的伤亡，那你就用这根魔矛的手柄敲一敲木偶；如果你想让那儿出现血流成河的大屠杀场面，那就用矛尖刺它们。”

阿本·哈布兹的脸色变得铁青，只见他浑身发抖，一把抓住了那根魔矛，踉踉跄跄地走向桌子，兴奋得连他那白胡子都一颤一颤的。“阿布·阿尤伯之子呀，”他嘿嘿一笑，高声说道，“我看还是叫他们流点血吧！”

说着，他就用魔矛向一些小木偶一阵乱刺，接着又用魔矛的把手猛敲另外的一些木偶，被刺的木偶倒地阵亡，而其余的则彼此厮杀，混战作一团。

占星家费了好大的气力才阻拦住这位追求宁静的君主，让他住了手，以免使敌人被消灭得一个不剩。末了，他好言劝说国王离开了瞭望塔，然后派侦察兵进山到洛浦隘口那儿了解情况。

侦察兵回来后，报告说有一支基督教军队曾经攻进了大山深处，眼看就要兵临格拉纳达城下，而就在此时，他们之间发生了内讧，彼此之间挥戈相向，死伤惨重，最终全部退出了边境。

抗敌神器的威力得到了验证，这叫阿本·哈布兹喜不自胜。只听他说道：“我终于能过上太平日子了，而且能叫所有的敌人都在我的掌控之中。大智大慧的阿布·阿尤伯之子呀，你给我带来了这样的好日子，我怎么报答你才好呢？”

“启禀陛下，身为一个上了年纪的人，一个哲学家，生活简单，所需不多。我别无所求，只求你给我一些东西装饰我的岩洞，以适合于我隐居，那我就心满意足了。”

“凡大智大慧者都生活节俭，真是难能可贵！”阿本·哈布兹口中赞叹不已，心里却为自己付出如此廉价的补偿而暗暗高兴。他召来司库，说伊伯拉西姆要装饰隐居处所，所需经费，要司库悉数供给。

于是，占星家吩咐工匠凿开坚硬的岩石，辟出许多房间来，形成几排和他的占星大厅相连的套房。他又叫人在各个房间里安置了许多奢华的靠背大椅子和长沙发，墙上挂起极为贵重的大马士革缎子作为饰品。他解释说：“我年纪大了，不能再让这把老骨头睡石榻了；这些石头墙太潮湿，有东西遮盖遮盖才好。”

他还吩咐人造了浴室，浴室里有各种各样的香水和芳香精油。他解释说：“要让老年人的四肢不至于僵硬，要让因为搞研究而衰弱了的躯体恢复活力和柔韧，洗洗澡是很有必要的。”

接下来，他叫人在各个房间里挂上无数的银灯和水晶灯，亲自按照从埃及墓穴中得来的方子配了一种香油盛在灯里。这种油点亮后长明不熄，发出的光很柔和，类似强弱适度的白昼之光。他解释说：“太阳光对于老年人来说太刺眼、太强烈了。再说，这种灯光对哲学家搞研究是比较适宜的。”

阿本·哈布兹国王的司库见装饰占星家的隐居处所每日所需数目巨大，不由暗暗叫苦，于是便跑去向国王诉说。不过，阿本·哈布兹觉得君子一言驷马难追，只好耸了耸肩说：“必须有耐心。这老头是想根据金字塔的内部结构以及埃及宏伟的古迹打造一个哲人的隐居所。不过，无论什么事都有个结束，他的岩洞终究会装修完的。”

果不其然，占星家的隐居处最后终于竣工了。这儿简直成了一个奢华的地下宫殿。占星家对此表示十分满意，之后三天闭门不出，埋头于自己的研究工作。过完这段时间，他又跑去见司库，说道：“还有一样东西是不可少的，它能在我脑力劳动之余给我带来一点安慰。”

“大智大慧的伊伯拉西姆，我奉命提供你过隐居生活所需要的一切东西。这次你需要的是什么东西呢？”

“我想要几个舞女。”

“什么，要舞女！”司库惊讶得叫出了声。

“对，是要舞女，”这位圣人语气庄重地回答说，“要年轻漂亮的。看到青春和美色能叫人精神焕发。只要几个就够了，因为我是一个生活简朴的哲学家，很容易满足。”

当哲学家伊伯拉西姆·伊本·阿布·阿尤伯以圣人的方式在隐居所里安然度日时，追求平静的阿本·哈布兹则在瞭望塔里操纵着木偶激战不已。这简直太奇妙了——一个像他这样过惯了安逸日子的老人，竟然能把战争变成儿戏，坐在房间里自娱自乐，举手便可叫一支大军灰飞烟灭，简单得就跟杀灭苍蝇一样。

有一段时间，他沉浸在战争游戏中，变得恣意妄为起来，甚至嘲弄和羞辱自己的邻邦，挑逗他们来犯。邻邦们屡犯屡败，逐渐学乖了，最后无人敢来侵犯他的领土了。一连好几个月，铜骑士一直保持着和平状态——矛头指向天空；这位尊贵的老国王无从玩自己玩惯了的游戏，不禁感到不耐烦了，生活无风无浪、单调乏味，让他觉得厌倦。

后来有一天，神器铜骑士突然转了方向，将手中的长矛放低，矛尖一动不动地指向瓜狄克斯山。阿本·哈布兹急忙爬上瞭望塔，可是朝着那个方向的魔桌却一点动静也没有，桌上的武士纹丝不动。这种情况叫他大惑不解，于是他便派了一支骑兵去山里侦察。骑兵去了三天之后，回来说：

“我们检查了每一条山道，没有见铠甲也没有见刀枪舞动，一路百般搜索，只发现了一个基督教的绝色少女。当时是中午时分，该女子正在泉水旁睡觉，我们把她抓住带了来。”

“抓到一个绝色美女！”阿本·哈布兹激动得两眼闪射出异彩，不由叫出了声，“快带她来见我！”

那个有倾城倾国之色的少女被带了来。她戴着许多奢华的装饰品——在阿拉伯人征服西班牙期间，这样的装饰在西班牙哥特人中间是很流行的。只见她一头乌云一般的披肩长发，秀发上点缀着无数雪白耀目的珍珠，前额上有几枚宝石在闪闪发光，和她的一双美眸发出的光彩不相上下。她的脖子上挂着一条金链，金链上吊一把银质的小竖琴，而那小竖琴垂至腰间。

她那水汪汪的乌黑的眼睛闪闪发光，犹如将火花溅到了阿本·哈布兹那虽然衰老但仍多情的心上；她轻举莲步，妖妖娆娆，使得他神魂颠倒。“绝代的佳人呀，”他心醉神迷地叫了起来，“你究竟是何人，是干什么的？”

“我是一个哥特王储的女儿。不久前，家父还统治一方。可是，他的军队像中了魔法一样，在这群山之中被消灭了个干净。如今，家父流亡他乡，而他的女儿成了俘虏。”

“当心，陛下！”伊伯拉西姆·伊本·阿布·阿尤伯悄声说，“她恐怕就是常听人们说起的北方女巫，善作媚态以迷惑不明就里的人。我觉得她的眼里有一股妖气，一举一动都暗藏邪术。毫无疑问，她就是铜骑士所指的敌人。”

“阿布·阿尤伯之子呀，”国王回应道，“你是个大智大慧的人，这我可以肯定，也许还是个魔术师，可是你在了解女人方面却是个外行。在这方面，我的能力不输于任何人，甚至不输于智慧的所罗门本人，别看他有那么多王后妃嫔。若说这个少女，我看她并无害人之心。她天姿国色，深得我的宠爱。”

“请听臣下一言，陛下！”占星家说，“靠着我的神器，陛下屡战屡胜，而我却从未分享过任何战利品。这次，就把这个流离失所的俘虏赐给臣下吧，让她用银质的小竖琴给孤独寂寞的我以抚慰。如果她真的是个女巫，我也有驱巫之策，能够施法消除她的妖力。”

“怎么！还要女人！”阿本·哈布兹嚷嚷了起来，“不是已经给你舞女了，还不够抚慰你吗？”

“固然有舞女了，此话不虚，然而却没有歌女。辛勤研究之后身心疲惫，我很想有个小歌女能叫我精神焕发。”

“你可不要贪得无厌，隐士！”国王耐不住性子，这样说道，“这个少女我要留给我自己。她给我带来了极大的安慰，甚至不亚于美女亚比煞(5)给智慧的所罗门之父大卫王所带来的欢乐。”

不管占星家再怎么苦苦哀求和劝说，国王只是不答应，回绝的口气愈加坚定，最后二人不欢而散。圣人把自己关在他的隐居所里，左想右想，感到特别失望。不过，他在离开国王那儿时，又对国王提出了警示，要他当心那个危险的俘虏。可是，一个坠入情网的老人怎么能听得进去别人的劝告呢？阿本·哈布兹为情所累，早已被迷得颠三倒四，全部的心思都放在了那个哥特美人身上，千方百计想赢得对方的芳心。他固然已青春不再，但是他有金银财宝。一个老人要是有了心上人，一般都出手大方。他派人到格拉纳达的市场上去，将那儿最贵重的东方珍品都搜刮了来。绸缎、珠宝、珍贵的宝石、精制的香水——凡是亚非两大陆所出产的奇珍异宝，他都毫不吝惜地赠给这位落难的公主。城里举办各种表演和庆祝活动，供美人观看；轻歌曼舞，竞技斗牛——格拉纳达一时盛会不断、热闹非凡。对于这般盛大的场面，哥特公主处之泰然，似乎早已习惯了奢华的生活。她把一切都视为对她身份的尊重，或者更确切地说，是对她美丽容貌的崇拜——对女人而言，美丽的容貌甚至胜过高贵的身份，更应该得到崇拜。不但如此，她似乎暗中以此为乐，故意刺激国王挥霍无度，消耗他的国库；对于国王的骄奢淫逸，她好像觉得很自然。尽管这位位高权重的恋人殷勤慷慨，却好像并没有赢得美人的芳心。美人固然没有横眉冷对，却也没有笑脸相迎。每当他向美人倾诉衷肠时，对方都会弹起她那银制的小竖琴。琴声里有一种魔力，让国王立刻就打起瞌睡，睡意袭遍全身，随后便昏昏睡去。醒来后，他感到神清气爽，然而情欲却悄然消退。他的求爱虽然受挫，但昏睡中总有美梦陪伴，使这位梦中恋人心醉神迷。于是他一个梦接一个梦，沉迷其中，而格拉纳达全城都在嘲笑他的痴情；看到他为一曲轻歌一掷千金，民怨为之沸腾。

最后，危险终于降临在了阿本·哈布兹的头上，而他那神器没有发出任何警告。他的都城里突然发生了暴乱，手持刀枪的暴民们把他的王宫围得水泄不通，扬言要他的命，并处死他的基督徒情人。这位君主旧有的好战精神在他的心中死灰复燃，于是他率领一队卫兵冲上前去，杀得暴民们作鸟兽散，将一场暴乱摧毁于萌芽之中。

暴乱平息之后，他前去见占星家，而后者仍在隐居所里闭门不出，心里对他恨恨不已。

阿本·哈布兹步上前，以和解的语气说道：“大智大慧的阿布·阿尤伯之子呀，你曾经预言说这个俘虏来的美女会给我带来危险，而今这一预言得到了应验。既然你料事如神，请你告诉我怎样才能防患于未然呢？”

“那个异教徒少女是祸根。应该离开她。”

“那我宁肯放弃我的江山。”阿本·哈布兹高声说道。

“那你会面临危险，江山和美人都保不住。”占星家答道。

“知识最为渊博的哲学家呀，请别如此严厉，不要发火生气。我既是国王，又是个坠入爱河的人，请考虑一下我的双重苦恼，想出一个万全之策保护我，让我远离灾难。其实我并不在乎荣华富贵，也不在乎权力，只渴望平安度日，避开纷扰的尘世，到一处世外桃源，忘掉一切烦恼、浮华和灾难，由爱情相伴，安安静静度过余生残年。”

占星家抬起两道浓眉，把他上下打量了几眼。

“如果我让你住进这样的一个世外桃源，你给我什么作为回报呢？”

“你要什么回报，请尽管说。只要在我的权力范围之内，不管你要什么都可以。只要我在世一天，那东西就是属于你的。”

“陛下大概听说过伊莱姆花园，那是阿拉伯的一个世外桃源。”

“这个花园我倒是听说过，《古兰经》里有记载，就在《破晓》那一章里。而且，我还听去麦加朝觐的香客提到过那儿，说那里有诸多奇异的景观，可我觉得这些不过是粗鄙的传说，就像到遥远的国度旅游的游客讲的海外奇谈。”

“游客的话不可不信，陛下，”占星家语气郑重地说，“因为他们从遥远的国度带回来的是珍贵的见闻。至于人们通常所说的伊莱姆的宫殿和花园， 并非子虚乌有，我可是亲眼所见。你不妨听我讲一讲那段经历，因为它跟你的诉求有关。

“话说年轻时，我只不过是游走于沙漠上的一个阿拉伯小青年，替家父照管骆驼群。一次，在穿过阿登沙漠的途中，一匹骆驼离群走失了。我一连找了好几天也没有找到。一天中午，我累得头昏眼花，就躺倒在一棵棕榈树下，傍着一眼枯井睡着了。醒来后，我发现自己来到了一座城市的城门前。走进城门，我看到许多华丽的街道、广场和市集，然而悄无声息，不见一个人影。我信步向前走去，走到一座美轮美奂的宫殿前，那儿有座园子，里面有喷水池、鱼塘、树丛、花圃和果实累累的果园，却仍不见一个人影出现。那儿静悄悄的，静得叫我心里发毛，于是我急挪步离开。急慌慌走到城门外，再回头看时，那地方已消失不见，眼前只有静悄悄、一望无际的沙漠，其他什么也看不见。

“在那一带，我遇见了一个年老的伊斯兰教士，此人对当地的风土人情和各种神秘的现象了如指掌。我把自己见到的情况告诉了他，他回答说：‘那是沙漠里的一个奇迹——闻名遐迩的伊莱姆花园。它只是偶然对你这样漂泊迷路的人现一现，让迷路人看到塔楼、宫殿和长满了果树的园子，由此觉得心情愉悦，随后它就会彻底消失，叫你除了荒寂的沙漠，什么也看不到。关于这个花园，还有一段故事呢。在很久以前，亚狄人居住于此。他们的国王希达德，他是艾德之子，诺亚之曾孙，在这片土地上建了一座辉煌壮观的城市。城市建成之后，他看见眼前是一片富丽堂皇的景象，顿生傲慢自大之心，决定再造一座王宫，王宫旁边是花园，而花园足以跟《古兰经》中描述的天堂花园相媲美。然而，由于他目空一切、不可一世，上天让诅咒降到了他身上。他以及他的臣民被从大地上抹掉，而他那辉煌壮观的城市、宫殿和花园则处于永久的魔力控制之下，让世人再也看不见，只是偶尔出现一下，以此使人们永远记住他的罪孽。’

“陛下，这个故事以及我所看见的奇观从那以后便在我心里扎下了根。数年后，我在埃及得到了智慧王所罗门的那本天书，决定故地重游，再去寻找一下伊莱姆花园。我去了，睁开法眼，看到了那花园，于是住进希达德的王宫，在他那仿造天堂里过了几天逍遥日子。我施展法力，叫看管伊莱姆花园的魔仆俯首听命。魔仆将控制花园的符咒告诉了我——该符咒可以让花园现形，也可以让它隐形。陛下呀，就在这个地方，我可以为你建造同样的宫殿和花园，地址选在城市旁边的山上，因为我了解那神秘的符咒，而且掌握着智慧王所罗门的天书。”

“大智大慧的阿布·阿尤伯之子呀！”阿本·哈布兹高声叫道，一边浑身发着抖，一副迫不及待的样子，“你不愧是个旅行家，看见过许多神奇的景象，掌握了许多知识！那就为我建造一所这样的乐园吧。你要什么回报都可以，甚至可以把我的半壁江山赐给你。”

“岂敢，岂敢！”对方回答道，“你知道我是个老年人，一个哲学家，是很容易满足的。我别无所求，只求得到走进宫殿魔法大门的第一匹牲口和它所驮的东西。”

国王没想到对方的要求如此简单，二话没说，欣然表示同意。于是，占星家便破土开始动工了。他叫人在山顶上，就在他那座地下隐居所的上面，建起了一座巨大的拱门，或称望楼，直通一座坚固的塔楼的中心。

拱门外有一条连廊，或称门廊，连廊上有一个高高的拱顶，而廊里有一个入口，入口处装着两扇结实的大门。在入口的拱心石上，占星家亲手刻下了一把巨大的钥匙的图形，又在连廊拱顶的拱心石上刻了一只巨大的手，位置高于入口处的图形。这些东西用作符咒，他冲着它们用无人可懂的语言念了几句咒语。

拱门竣工后，他把自己关在占星大厅里，一连两天闭门不出，暗中作法念咒。到了第三天，他爬上山，在山顶上过了一整天。夜里很晚他才下了山，来见阿本·哈布兹。

“启禀陛下，”他说道，“我的工程终于完工了。山顶上的那座宫殿是人类所能设计出的最精美的宫殿，也是人们最渴望居住的宫殿。那儿有辉煌壮丽的大厅和回廊，有美丽的花园、清洌的泉水和芬芳的浴池。一句话，那一整座山被改造成了一个极乐世界。跟伊莱姆花园一样，它受到强大的法力保护，被隐藏起来，除了掌握符咒秘密的人，凡人是看不见、找不到的。”

“好样的！”阿本·哈布兹喜不自禁地高声叫道，“明天早晨天一亮，咱们就上山入住。”

这天夜里，国王兴奋得辗转反侧，难以成寐。次日，几乎还没等阳光照到白雪皑皑的内华达山的峰顶，他就骑上马，只带着几个亲信随从，沿着陡峭狭窄的小径上了山。他旁边走着一匹小白马，那位哥特公主骑在上面，只见她身上珠宝闪闪发光，颈上挂着她的那把银制的小竖琴。占星家步行，走在他的另一侧，拄着他的那根刻有象形文字的手杖——他从不骑任何坐骑。

阿本·哈布兹急于看见宫殿那光彩夺目的塔楼出现在山头上，看见花园的凉亭花台横亘于山脊之上，然而却迟迟瞧不见它们的身影。“那是个神秘的地方，是受魔法保护的，”占星家解释说，“不穿过那道受符咒控制的拱门，拥有了那个地方，你是什么也看不见的。”

接近那道拱门时，占星家停下来，把雕刻在拱顶上那只神秘的手和钥匙指给国王看，说道：“那是卫护这座乐园入口的镇符。除非那只手伸下来抓住那把钥匙，否则，无论是人力还是魔力，都奈何不了这座山的主人。”

就在阿本·哈布兹瞪圆双眼、张大嘴巴，默默无语、惊讶万分地观望之时，那匹小白马已驮着公主向前，从入口进去，到了望楼的中心。

“瞧呀！”占星家叫了起来，“这就是你答应过的给我的报酬——走进魔法大门的第一匹牲口和它所驮的东西。”

阿本·哈布兹笑了笑，觉得这老头在开玩笑，可是却发现对方是认真的，不由气得直哆嗦，连他那灰白胡子也在跟着发抖。

“阿布·阿尤伯之子，”他板着脸说道，“这模棱两可的话到底是什么意思？我答应过你把第一匹走进这个入口的牲口和它驮的东西赐给你，你明明知道其中真正的含义是什么。你可以到我的牲口棚里去，挑上一匹最强壮的骡子，驮走我库存的价值连城的珍宝，那些全归你。可是，你怎么胆敢起非分之心，夺走我心头的欢乐！”

“珍宝于我有何用？”占星家用一种轻蔑的语气高声说，“我有智慧王所罗门的天书，能掌握人世间所有的秘密宝藏。这个公主归我所有。陛下有言在先，不能反悔，我需要的是她。”

公主从马上居高临下，高傲地望着他们，看见这两个白胡子老头为了霸占青春和美色而起争端，她那玫瑰色的芳唇上不由泛起一丝藐视的微笑。国王勃然大怒，不顾一切地叫嚷道：“你这个沙漠里的贱种，就算你懂得不少邪法，也应当知道我是你的主人，不允许你对你的国王耍花招。”

“我的主人！我的国王！”占星家说道，“你恐怕只是鼹鼠国的国王，竟然想凌驾于掌握着所罗门法力的人之上！永别了，阿本·哈布兹，你就在这个弹丸之地称王称霸吧，就在这个傻瓜乐园里醉生梦死吧。至于我，我要在我那哲人隐居所里嘲笑你。”

他说着，一把抓住小马的缰绳，用手杖磕了磕地面，便带着那位哥特公主在望楼的中心位置沉入地心。地面在他们头上又合拢了，他们所进入的地洞口消失了，一点痕迹也没有留下。

阿本·哈布兹惊愕万分，一时连话也说不出来了。待醒过神之后，他叫来一千名工匠，在占星家遁去的那个地方用鹤嘴锄和铁锨朝地心挖。他们挖啊挖，但毫无进展，山体坚如磐石，让他们手中的工具无用武之地。即便能挖进去一点，然而刚将土铲出，地面就又合拢了。阿本·哈布兹到山脚下，再想找通向占星家的地下宫殿的洞口，却无处可寻了。原来明明是洞口，现在却成了原始岩石坚硬的地表。随着伊伯拉西姆·伊本·阿布·阿尤伯的遁形，他的神器也不灵验了。那个铜骑士死死地固定在原地，面向大山，矛尖指向占星家遁入地心的地方，仿佛那儿潜伏着阿本·哈布兹最凶狠的死敌。

时不时可以隐约听见大山的心里传来琴乐之声和一个女子的莺声燕语。一天，有个农夫向国王禀报，说头天夜里他发现岩石上出现了一个裂口，于是就爬了进去，向下一看，看见了一个地下大厅，占星家坐在大厅里的一个华美的长沙发上，听着那位公主弹奏银质小竖琴，头一点一点地昏昏欲睡，似乎竖琴的魔力控制了他的神智。

阿本·哈布兹找到了岩石上的那个裂口，可是它又合严了。他重鼓干劲，想把情敌从地下挖出来，但一切努力都化为泡影。刻在拱心石上的那只手和那把钥匙具有极大的魔力，非人力可以制胜。至于山头上占星家许诺建造宫殿和花园的地方，仍是光秃秃的，一片荒芜。也许，他所鼓吹的极乐世界受到魔法的控制，世人难见，要不然，这些都纯粹是他编造出的故事。世人都好心地认为一切都属于后一种情况。有人将这块地方称为“国王犯傻地”，也有人叫它“傻瓜乐园”。

令阿本·哈布兹更为苦恼的是：从前他掌握着那个骑士神器时，对邻邦又是辱骂又是嘲弄，杀戮他们以作消遣，如今他失去了魔法的保护，敌人就从四面八方攻占他的国土，使得这位渴望过平静日子的国王在风烛残年始终处于动乱的烦恼之中。

后来，阿本·哈布兹死了，被埋在了墓地里。光阴似箭，不知又过了多少年，那座多事的山头上建起了阿尔罕布拉宫，总算在某种程度上将传说中的乐土伊莱姆花园变成了现实。那座受魔力控制的拱门完整地保留至今，毫无疑问是受到了那只神秘的手和钥匙的保护，不过现在叫作“正义之门”，即阿尔罕布拉宫的正门。据说在这座拱门下面，年老的占星家至今仍住在他的地下大厅里，坐在长沙发上一边听公主弹奏银质小竖琴，一边打着盹。

夏夜，守卫拱门的几位年老多病的哨兵常常会听到琴声，感受到催眠之力，便在岗哨上酣然入睡。不仅如此，这种使人昏昏欲睡的力量简直弥漫了这片地方，连白天站岗的哨兵也往往被人瞧见坐在望楼的石凳上打盹，或者躺在附近的树下睡觉。实际上，在所有的基督教国家里，这儿恐怕是最容易叫人入睡的岗哨了。根据古老的传说，情况世世代代均是如此。公主始终是占星家的俘虏，而占星家也始终为公主的魔琴所迷惑，昏昏欲睡的。这种状况要延续到世界的末日，除非那只神秘的手能抓住那把神奇的钥匙，将这座被施了咒语的大山里的妖气一扫而空。





注释


阿尔·马卡里在《西班牙的伊斯兰王朝史》一书中引用了另一个阿拉伯作家的话讲述符咒神器，类似于本故事里提到的神器。

他说：在卡迪斯，从前有一座方形塔，高达一百肘尺，用一块块巨石筑成，用铜箍固定。塔顶有一尊人的塑像，右手持一物，面向大西洋，用左手的食指指着直布罗陀海峡。据说该塔是古代安达卢斯的哥特国王所建，用作航标，为海上的人导航。北非的巴巴利和安达卢斯的穆斯林将其视为符咒，认为它能对大海施展魔力。在它的指引下，大批海盗蜂拥而至，这些海盗属于一个叫玛居斯的国家，他们乘坐大船来到岸边，船头和船尾各有一张方形风帆。他们每隔六七年来一次，掳走海上所有的船只，然后在塔顶人像的指引下经海峡进入地中海，在安达卢斯的海岸登陆，烧杀掠夺，有时将锋芒指向对岸，甚至波及叙利亚。

后来国内爆发内战，一位穆斯林将领攻占了卡迪斯，听说塔顶上的人像是纯金的，便命令将其弄下来砸碎，结果发现那人像是黄铜铸成，外边镀了一层金。人像破碎了，它对大海的魔力也消失了。自此，再也未见海盗的踪影——人们只是在岸边两处地方发现了海盗沉船的残骸：一处在玛居斯的港口，另一处靠近阿尔·阿汗海角。

阿尔·马卡里上面提到的海上入侵者八成是北欧人。

在阿尔罕布拉宫的城堡之内，王宫的正前方有一片宽展的空地，人称“蓄水池之地”，或称“蓄水池广场”（西班牙语叫la Plaza de los Algibes）。之所以得此名称，是因为此处地下有一些蓄水池，自打摩尔王朝时代就已经存在，从地表是看不见的。广场的一角有一眼摩尔式水井，是在岩石上凿出来的，很深很深，井水冷如寒冰，清澈似水晶。摩尔人打的井素有大名，世人皆知他们打井往往不辞劳苦，只为了求得最纯净、最甘甜的清泉。咱们现在说的这眼井在格拉纳达享有盛名，前来取水者络绎不绝，有的用大水罐盛水扛在肩上，有的赶着毛驴驮着装水的瓦罐，沿着阿尔罕布拉宫那浓荫遮蔽的道路上山下山，从清晨到深夜往来不息。

早在《圣经》中记载的那些年代，一到暑天，清泉以及水井旁就成了人们聚会闲谈的地方。此处所说的那眼井边，简直就是个长期俱乐部，从早到晚都聚集着一些人，有残疾人，有老太太，还有城堡里的一些好奇心十足的游手好闲者。他们坐在的石凳上，水井上方有如盖的浓荫为这些小道消息采集者遮阳。大家东一搭西一搭地讲些城堡里的琐事，一见取水人就打听城里的新闻，无论听到或看到什么，总要滔滔不绝发表一通议论。一天之中，无论什么时候，都可以看到一些闲散的主妇和懒惰的女佣或头顶或手提水罐跑来，听这些可敬的人物无休无止地高谈阔论，久久不愿离开。

在前来取水的人当中有一身材敦实、结实有力的罗圈腿小个子，名叫佩德罗·吉尔，而人们图简便，称他佩雷吉尔。此人是个水贩子，自然也就是加里西亚人了，即加里西亚自治区(1)的土著居民。老天制造出了各种不同种族的人，就像造出各种鸟兽一样，让他们从事各种劳动。在法国，擦皮鞋者必是萨瓦人，旅馆的门童必是瑞士人；在英国，盛行裙圈和发粉的那些日子，若论抬轿，谁也不如善走的爱尔兰人抬得稳当。在西班牙，水贩子和搬运工必是身材敦实的小个子加里西亚人。请人搬运东西，没谁会说“给我找个搬运工来”，而是说“给我请个加里西亚人来”。

以下言归正传。话说加里西亚人佩雷吉尔初涉此行时，只有一只大瓦罐，扛在肩上用以贩水。后来逐渐发迹，他便买了一头适合于干这一行的牲口当助手——即一只毛茸茸、结实有劲的毛驴。这个长耳朵助手的腰两侧各挂了一只大水罐，就像两个驮筐一样，上面盖着无花果树叶遮阳。在格拉纳达所有的水贩子里，谁也没有他那般勤劳，也都不如他快活。只见他跟在毛驴的身后沿街叫卖：“谁要水呀？谁要比雪还要冰的水呀？谁要阿尔罕布拉宫的井水，冷如寒冰，清澈似水晶？”他那欢快的叫声响彻了街头巷尾。在夏天，西班牙的城镇到处都可以听得见这样的叫卖声。每当他用亮晶晶的玻璃杯斟一杯井水给顾客喝的时候，都会说一句入耳的话，令对方高兴得露出微笑。如果顾客是位漂亮的夫人或脸带酒窝的少女，他则机灵地抛个媚眼，夸对方长得漂亮，让对方喜不自禁。于是乎，加里西亚人佩雷吉尔在格拉纳达就成了一个家喻户晓的人物，都说他是个最懂礼貌、最讨人欢喜、最快活的人。

孰不知，叫卖的声音高，喜欢开玩笑，并不一定说明心情轻松。别看老实巴交的佩雷吉尔表面轻松愉快，心里却有着许多忧虑和苦恼。他有一大家子人要养活——衣衫褴褛的孩子们饿得像一窝嗷嗷待哺的雏燕，叽里哇啦乱叫，傍晚见他回家，就围着他要吃的。他倒也是有“内助”的，但此女却对他没有一点帮助。她婚前是村里的大美女，出了名地爱跳波列罗舞和敲响板。如今，她仍旧保持着早年的嗜好，把老实巴交的佩雷吉尔辛辛苦苦挣来的钱胡糟蹋在俗艳的服饰上，每逢星期天、圣徒节日以及那许多数不清的假日（西班牙的节假日比工作日还要多），便常常骑着家里仅有的毛驴到乡间游山玩水。除此之外，她还邋里邋遢的，喜欢睡懒觉，是个头等喜欢嚼舌根的人，不管家，不管孩子，什么都抛下不管，趿拉着鞋四处串门交流是非。

而佩雷吉尔则逆来顺受，把婚姻的枷锁套在自己驯顺的脖子上。他将妻子儿女带来的沉重负担驮在自己身上，就像毛驴驮水罐那样恭顺。有时，他私下里也会摇头叹息，然而却从不敢质问他的那个懒婆娘的持家之道。

他对自己的孩子有着舐犊之情，甚至可以说像猫头鹰爱它的雏鸟一样。他看到自己的形象在儿女的身上得到了复制和保留——小家伙们个个都是身材敦实、结实有力的罗圈腿。老实巴交的佩雷吉尔最大的欢乐莫过于能挤出一天空闲时间，从牙缝里省出一点小钱，带着一群小家伙到平原上的那些果园里嬉戏玩耍——孩子们有的被他抱在怀里，有的扯着他的衣服下摆，有的屁颠屁颠跟在他身后。而这种时候，他的妻子却在和朋友们欢度假日，在达罗谷里翩翩起舞呢。

一个夏日的晚上，夜已深，差不多所有的水贩子都已休息，结束了一天的辛勤劳作。白天酷暑难当，夜里却月色皎洁，诱使南国的人们走出家门，流连于户外，呼吸几口柔和而清新的空气，以消除白天的暑热，同时活动一下筋骨，直至后半夜才回家。因而，街头仍有买水的顾客。佩雷吉尔身为慈父，总为儿女着想，为儿女不辞劳苦，此时想到自己的孩子在挨饿，于是便对自己说：“应该再到井边跑一趟，这样，星期天能给孩子们添碗肉汤喝。”说着，他又沿着阿尔罕布拉宫那陡峭的道路顽强地向山上爬去，一边走路一边唱歌，时不时还会用棍子在毛驴的腰眼上重重抽打一下，有时抽打是为了跟自己的歌合拍，有时则是为了叫毛驴打起精神——在西班牙，无论对任何负重的牲口，一般都是用狠狠抽打来代替草料的。

到了井边，他发现那儿空荡荡的，月光下只看得见一个穿着摩尔服装的外乡人，孤零零坐在石凳上。他不由收住了脚步，惊讶地望着对方，心里甚至有点害怕。而那个摩尔人有气无力地朝他招招手叫他过去，然后对他说道：“我浑身虚弱，怕是病了。请你帮帮忙把我送进城去。你送水挣多少钱，我会加倍给你的。”

小个子水贩子心软，听了外乡人的请求，顿生怜悯之情，说道：“救危扶贫是人之常情，我怎能要你的回报！神不允许的！”说完，他把摩尔人扶上驴背，慢慢地走向格拉纳达。可怜的摩尔人已经虚弱到了极点，一路上得扶着他，他才不至于从驴背上摔下来。

进了城，水贩子问摩尔人该把他送往何处。摩尔人声音微弱地说：“唉！我是个外乡人，举目无亲，无处栖身。求你让我今天晚上在你家里过一夜吧，我定有重谢。”

老实巴交的佩雷吉尔没料到自己竟会被这么一个异族的客人缠住，可他生就一副好心肠，见对方处境悲惨，不忍心拒绝对方要到他家过夜的的请求。于是，他把摩尔人领到了自己家中。孩子们像往日一样，听见毛驴踢踏踢踏地走来，一声喊迎了上去，可是看见包着头巾的外乡人，又吓得跑了回来，躲到他们母亲身后。做母亲的则勇敢地冲上前去，就像是一只老母鸡看见野狗跑过来，便竖起羽毛冲上去保护小鸡一样。

“天这么晚了，你竟然把一个异教徒带到家里来！”她嚷嚷道，“这不明明是引火烧身，想上宗教法庭么！”

“别发火，老婆！”佩雷吉尔说道，“这个可怜的外乡人有病在身，在这里举目无亲，难道你忍心把他赶走，让他死在街上吗？”

做妻子的本来还要争执，因为虽说她住的是穷屋陋室，但在维护家庭声誉方面则针锋相对，寸步不让。不过，这一次，矮小的水贩子脖子硬了起来，坚决不肯屈服。他扶着那个可怜的伊斯兰教徒下了毛驴，把他扶到家里最凉快的地方，铺了一张席子和一张羊皮让他躺下——在这户贫寒人家，只能以此当床了。

过了没多大一会儿，摩尔人突然浑身痉挛，颤抖得厉害。纯朴的水贩子急忙趋前救护，却无济于事。可怜的病人眼里流露出对他的感激。在抽搐的间歇，摩尔人把他叫到身旁，小声对他说：“我怕是不行了。如果我死了，我把这个匣子留给你，报答你的恩情。”摩尔人说着，解开了斗篷，露出捆在身上的一只檀香木匣子。“我的朋友，”可敬的小个子加里西亚人说道，“上帝一定会赐给你长寿，让你能活许多年，享受你的财宝。”摩尔人摇摇头，把手放在匣子上，本来还想交代几句关于匣子的情况，却突然又痉挛了起来，抖得比刚才更厉害了，须臾便咽了气。

水贩子的妻子见状，一下子乱了心绪，开口说道：“都怪你愚蠢的好心惹来了祸事，有心帮别人，却总是麻烦缠身。叫别人在咱们家发现这具尸体，那该如何是好？咱们会被错认成杀人犯，锒铛入狱的。即便侥幸不死，也会毁于公证员及警察之手。”

可怜的佩雷吉尔也同样万分苦恼，甚至有点后悔，怪自己不该因行善而自找麻烦。后来，他灵机一动，想出了个主意，便说道：“趁着天还没有亮，我可以把尸体运出城去，把它埋在塞尼河岸边的沙地里。没人看见摩尔人进了咱们家，对于他的死是不会有人知道的。”

他说干就干。妻子帮着他，二人用不幸的伊斯兰教徒临终前睡的那张席子把他的尸体卷起来，横搭在驴背上面，然后由佩雷吉尔将其运到河岸上去。

歹运却往往与人作对。他家对面住着一个理发匠，名叫帕蒂罗·帕德鲁果，属于惹是生非的一类人，最喜欢的就是打听别人的隐私、说长道短、设奸计捉弄人。这个无赖生得獐头鼠目，两条腿细如麻秆，口蜜腹剑，专会套人的话，对于别人家的私事无所不知，若论这方面的知识，恐怕那位大名鼎鼎的塞维利亚的理发师(2)也会自叹弗如。对于自己掌握的情况，他像个筛子似的一句话也留不住。据说，这家伙睡觉时一只眼睛是睁着的，一只耳朵也是竖着的，对于周围发生的事情既能看得见也能听得到。当然，对于格拉纳达城里的那些喜欢听小道消息的人来说，他就是个丑闻逸事的传声筒，所以在同行里他的顾客是最多的。

话说这爱管闲事的理发匠听见佩雷吉尔半夜三更归家弄出的响动以及他的妻子儿女叫嚷的声音，急忙把脑袋探出小窗口以看个究竟——他总是以此窗口作为瞭望台，眼见得他的邻居将一个身着摩尔式服装的人搀扶进了家门。他觉得此事十分蹊跷，弄得他一夜都没有合眼。隔上五分钟，他就会跑到窗口，望一望邻居家门缝里透出来的闪烁的灯光。天亮之前，他发现佩雷吉尔赶着毛驴出了门，毛驴的背上驮着一样怪模怪样的东西。

这个喜欢探听消息的理发匠坐不住了，立时穿好衣服，悄无声息摸上前去，远远跟在水贩子的后边，一直跟到塞尼河的岸边，然后就见他在沙地里挖了个坑，将一个死尸样的东西埋了进去。

理发匠慌忙回到家里，如热锅上的蚂蚁般在他的理发店里转来转去，不知碰翻了多少东西。这样一直折腾到太阳升起，随后他将一只脸盆夹在腋下，匆匆忙忙去了市长家——他每天都去为市长理容。

市长刚刚起床。帕蒂罗·帕德鲁果让他坐在椅子上，把布巾围在他的脖子上，放一盆热水在他的面前，然后用手指将他的胡子搓软。

“真是咄咄怪事呀！”身兼理发匠和小道消息传播者两职的帕德鲁果启口说道，“真是咄咄怪事呀！谋财害命、埋尸灭迹全发生在一个晚上！”

“你说什么？这是说的哪门子的事呀？”市长高声问。

“我是说，”理发匠一面回着话，一面拿起一块肥皂在这位高官的鼻子上和嘴上擦来擦去，因为西班牙的理发匠不屑于用刷子涂抹剃须液，“我是说，那个叫佩雷吉尔的加里西亚人谋财害命，杀了一个摩尔族的伊斯兰教徒，而且就在当天晚上埋尸灭迹。这一夜可真是一个凶夜！”

“这些你是怎么知道的？”市长问。

“别急，市长先生，听我细细道来。”帕蒂罗一面回答，一面用手捏着市长的鼻子，拿起一把剃刀轻轻地在他的脸上刮着。接下来，他把自己看见的情况一五一十讲了一遍。他一边为市长刮胡子、洗下巴，并用一块脏毛巾将下巴擦干，一边叙述着水贩子谋财害命，杀死和掩埋那个伊斯兰教徒的经过。

说来也巧，这位市长是个横行霸道、作威作福、贪得无厌的官吏，全格拉纳达城数他最腐败。不过，无可否认，他对于正义的估价倒是很高的，因为他出卖正义也是按着案子的轻重索价的。他将这桩案子定性为谋财害命——毫无疑问，这样的案子有大利可图。可是，怎么样执法才妥当呢？把罪犯抓住绳之以法，那只不过是绞刑架上添了个人而已；但是，如果拿到赃款，就会使执法者受益——按照他的信条，这才是实现正义的伟大目标。有了这样的小算盘，他把自己最信得过的一个警官叫了来。该警官骨瘦如柴，是个有着饿死鬼面相的恶棍，平时穿便装，着一身古代西班牙服饰，戴一顶宽大的卷边黑色獭皮帽子，脖子上围着一个古怪的领圈，披一件小黑斗篷，脏得发黑的内衣裹着他那精瘦、结实的躯体，手中老提着一根细细的白棍子，这是象征着他职务的可怕的标志。就是这样的一条古代西班牙种的执法猎犬被放了出去，去寻找那个不幸的水贩子的踪迹。他的动作快捷准确，未等可怜的佩雷吉尔回到家中，便抓住了他，将他连人带驴一起带去见法律的执掌人。

市长面露凶相，一副穷凶极恶的样子。“你给我听着，罪犯！”他咆哮道，吓得小个子加里西亚人腿都软了，“你给我听着，罪犯！你不用抵赖，你的犯罪事实我全都知道。你所犯的罪行，送你上绞架才合适。不过，我心肠软，是个通情达理的人。在你家里被谋杀了的那家伙是个摩尔人，是异教徒，是基督教的敌人。毫无疑问，你一定怀有炽烈的宗教热情，冲动之下才杀了他。因此，我要从宽处理。你只要把从他身上抢来的财物交出来，此事就不再追究。”

可怜的水贩子把所有的圣徒的名字都喊遍了，想叫他们证明自己的无辜。可是，没有一个圣徒显灵。话又说回来，假如圣徒显了灵，这位市长不把圣徒历(3)扔掉才怪呢。水贩子把自己救助垂死的摩尔人的经过陈述了一遍，语言简单、事实清楚，但最终还是白费口舌。“你是不是坚持说，”这位法官厉声喝道，“这个伊斯兰教徒身上既没有金银，也没有珠宝？金银珠宝不正是你犯罪的起因吗？”

“苍天在上，市长大人，”水贩子回答说，“除了一个檀香木小匣子，他身上一无所有。他将小匣子遗赠给了我，作为对我的报偿。”

“一个檀香木小匣子！一个檀香木小匣子！”市长连声叫道，联想到匣子里可能有宝石，两眼熠熠闪射出光芒。“匣子在哪里？你把它藏在哪里了？”

“启禀市长大人，”水贩子回答说，“它就在我家毛驴背上的一个驮篓里。衷心听从大人的指派。”

没等他话音落地，那位机灵的警官就冲了出去，一眨眼的工夫便把那个神秘的檀香木匣子拿了来。市长把匣子打开，急切得手都发抖了。在场的人全都凑上去看，想着里面肯定有珠宝，然而却大失所望，匣子里除了一张写满了阿拉伯文的羊皮纸和半截蜡烛之外，别的什么也没有。

在给犯人加罪名却捞不到好处的情况下，甚至在西班牙，法律也会变得公正起来。市长从一阵失望中清醒了过来，意识到这桩案子里的确没有赃款，于是就平心静气地听水贩子的辩词，而这辩词与水贩子妻子后来的证词相吻合。因而，他认为水贩子无罪，并将他当场释放。非但如此，他还允许水贩子把摩尔人的遗产——那个檀香木匣子以及里面的东西——一起带走，作为他做好事应得的报酬，却扣下毛驴充当诉讼费。

这下子，倒霉的小个子加里西亚人又得自己去背水了，肩头扛着一只大瓦罐步履艰难地前往阿尔罕布拉宫的水井取水卖。

一个夏日的中午，他冒着酷暑行走在山路上，平常好性子的他突然怒气冲胸，不由叫出了声：“狗市长，居然对一个穷人下手，抢走他赖以生存的毛驴！那可是我在这个世界上最好的朋友呀！”想起自己在工作中的那个可爱的伙伴，他满腔温情，心都快碎了。“啊，我的宝贝毛驴呀！”他将水罐放在一块岩石上，抹去额头上的汗珠，高声叫道，“啊，我的宝贝毛驴呀！我敢说你一定在思念着你的主人！我敢说你一定念念不忘这些水罐！可怜的毛驴呀！”

更叫他痛苦的是，一回家，妻子就对着他哭天抹泪，有发不完的牢骚。显而易见，她觉得自己理直气壮，因为她早就警告过他万不可过于热情好客，后来他的善举果然招来了灾难。她是个得理不饶人的婆娘，一有机会就摆出架势揶揄他，拿话头呛他。如果孩子要东西吃，或者要件新衣服穿，她就带着轻蔑的语气回答：“找你爸爸去！他是阿尔罕布拉宫里奇科国王(4)的王位继承人，叫他用摩尔人的那个宝贝匣子替你想办法吧。”

有谁像这个可怜人一样因行善反遭厄运，受到如此严厉的惩罚呢？不幸的佩雷吉尔已经心力交瘁，却还要默默忍受妻子的责骂。一天傍晚，他顶着暑热辛苦了一天，回到家来，妻子对着他又是一阵冷嘲热讽，而这次他终于耐不住性子了。他不敢还嘴，只是用眼睛盯着架子上的那个檀香木匣子，而那匣子半开着盖，似乎在嘲笑烦恼不堪的他。他气得一把抓起匣子摔到了地上，大叫道：“那天看见你，就算倒了霉了。千不该万不该，就不该把你的主人领回家来！”

匣子落地，匣盖大开，里面的羊皮纸卷滚了出来。

佩雷吉尔坐在那里盯着羊皮纸，闷闷不乐，半天不作声。后来，他陷入了沉思，暗忖：“那个摩尔人如此精心地保留着这玩意儿，说不准上面的字很重要呢。”于是他捡起羊皮纸卷揣在怀里，次日早晨沿街卖水时，在一家摩尔人开的店铺门前停了下来，求店主解释一下纸卷上那些字的含义。店主是个丹吉尔(5)人，在市场上卖珠宝首饰和香水为生。

这位摩尔人仔细读了纸卷上的字，然后捋一捋胡子，笑着说：“这是一种符咒，用它可以找到受魔力控制的宝藏。据说它法力无边，哪怕最结实的门闩和铁栅栏，还有那坚硬的岩石，在它面前也会不堪一击！”

“没用！”小个子加里西亚人叫了起来，“这对我有什么用？我又不是巫师，根本不懂宝藏什么的。”说完，他将水罐扛到肩上，把纸卷留在摩尔人手里，又去忙他的营生了。

当天傍晚暮色降临时，他走到阿尔罕布拉宫的水井旁边歇脚，发现那儿聚了一群人在闲聊。在这个天色昏暗的时辰，大家闲扯的内容跟往常没什么不同，仍然是些老掉牙的故事以及神鬼传奇。这些人都是一贫如洗的穷光蛋，特别喜欢聊当时最流行的话题——阿尔罕布拉宫里到处都有摩尔人埋藏的财宝，而那些财宝都被施了魔法。最值得一提的是：大家都深信在七层塔的底下深埋着大量的宝藏。

这些说法在老实巴交的佩雷吉尔的脑海里留下了非常深的印象。晚上摸黑独自行走在回家的路上，那些传说叫他浮想联翩：“如果七层塔下真的有宝藏，如果我留在摩尔人那儿的羊皮纸卷能帮我找到它，那该有多好呀！”想到此处，他顿时喜不自禁，肩上的水罐差点没掉下来摔碎。

夜里，他辗转反侧，几乎没有合眼，心里翻江倒海地想个不停。次日天一亮，他就奔到摩尔人的店里，把自己心里的所思所想都告诉了摩尔人。“你会念阿拉伯文，”他说道，“咱俩不妨一起去七层塔那儿，试一试这符咒的威力。即便不灵，也无害处可言；而如果符咒灵验，找到的宝藏咱俩就将其平分掉。”

“等一等，”这位伊斯兰教徒回答道，“光凭这符咒是不够的。要解读它，必须是在夜间，还得点上一支用特殊材料配制的蜡烛才行，而我手头是没有这种材料的。没有这种蜡烛，光有羊皮纸卷是不顶用的。”

“不必多言！”小个子加里西亚人高声说道，“我有这种蜡烛，马上就给你拿过来。”说完，他急如星火地赶回家，在檀香木匣子里找到那半截黄黄的蜡烛，很快拿了来。

摩尔人摸了摸，又嗅了嗅，然后说道：“这根黄蜡烛里掺有珍稀贵重的香料，正是羊皮纸卷上所说的蜡烛。点亮时，不管再结实的墙、再神秘的洞穴，都会敞开的。这蜡烛一灭，谁要是还留在里面没出来，那可就遭殃了。他会受到魔法的控制，会和那些财宝一道被禁锢在里面。”

二人商定要在当夜去试验符咒的威力。于是，这天半夜三更，除了蝙蝠和猫头鹰，没有生物在野外活动的时候，他们登上阿尔罕布拉宫的那座树木茂密的山丘，向七层塔进发——此塔林木环绕，被许许多多的民间传说渲染得狰狞可怕。他们挑灯摸路前行，穿过灌木丛和乱石堆，一直走到塔楼低层的地下室门前。他们怕得要命，战战兢兢地沿着石梯而下，向石洞的纵深处走去。石梯通向一间空室，那儿潮湿又阴森。再走下一段石梯，就到了一个位置更深的石室。这样，他们走过了四段石梯，层层深入，经过了四间石室。到了第四间石室，再朝前走路就不通了。根据传说，下面还有三间石室，然而却无法再深入，因为它们受到强大魔法的控制，被幽闭在地下。这第四间石室空气潮湿、寒冷，还带着泥土味，灯笼几乎连光也没有了。他们停下来等待，紧张得大气不敢出，一直等到隐约听见望楼上敲响午夜的钟声。这时，他们点亮那半截蜡烛，蜡烛马上散发出一股气味，里面有没药香、乳香及苏合香。

摩尔人开始急促地念纸卷上的阿拉伯文，几乎没等他念完就听见轰隆一声响，像地底下响起了闷雷，山摇地动，地面似打哈欠般张开一个口，露出了一段石阶。他们战战兢兢拾阶而下，借助灯笼的光亮发现自己进入了一间石室，里面刻满了阿拉伯文。石室的中央放着一口大箱子，用七条铁箍封死，箱子的两端各坐一个全身盔甲的摩尔人，但在符咒魔力的控制之下，全都木雕石塑般一动也不动。箱子前面有几只罐子，里面装满了金银珠宝。他们将手伸进一个最大的罐子，伸得有齐肘深，一把一把捞出许多黄澄澄的摩尔人铸的大金币，或者金镯子金首饰之类的东西，偶尔指头上还会勾起一个东方的珍珠项圈。他们浑身发抖，喘着粗气，将那些宝贝朝衣袋里直塞，一边还不时担惊受怕地望一眼那两个受魔法控制的摩尔人，但见那两个人脸色狰狞、纹丝不动，目不转睛地瞪着他们。后来，他们觉得自己听见了什么声音，吓得屁滚尿流，急忙向石阶奔去，连滚带爬冲到了上面的石室里，慌乱中碰倒蜡烛，致使烛光熄灭。接着又听见一声闷雷响，地面又合拢了。

二人惊讶万分，脚下不敢停留，急急忙忙摸黑逃出了塔楼，这时看见星光透过树梢洒落在地面上。他们在青草上席地而坐，平分了得来的财宝，决定这一次暂且罢手，以后找个夜晚再来一次，将罐子里的东西全部拿走。虽有言在先，但为确保万无一失，他们将探宝神器分开保管——一个保管羊皮纸卷，另外一个保管蜡烛。做完这件事之后，两人就一起带着轻松的心情，衣袋里装满金银珠宝，返回格拉纳达去了。

下山的时候，精明的摩尔人附在天真的小个子水贩子耳边，悄悄地说了两句忠告。

“佩雷吉尔朋友，”他说道，“此事必须严格保密，等咱们把全部财宝弄到手，没有危险的时候再说。万一有一点风声传到市长的耳朵里，那咱们可就玩完了！”

“这是当然的，”加里西亚人回应道，“此话一点不假。”

“佩雷吉尔朋友，”摩尔人说，“你是个谨慎的人，我知道你一定能守口如瓶；然而，你还有个妻子呢。”

“此事我对她只字不提。”小个子水贩子语气坚定地说。

“那好，”摩尔人说，“我相信你能够守口如瓶，也相信你一诺千金。”

水贩子的话恐怕是天下最诚恳、最郑重的诺言了。可是，你想想，有哪个男人有秘密能瞒得过自己的妻子呢？水贩子佩雷吉尔这样的男人是绝对不行的——他是个极其宠爱妻子、对妻子百依百顺的丈夫。回到家时，他看见妻子正郁郁寡欢地待在一个角落里。见他走进家门，妻子便嚷嚷了起来：“好呀，你总算回来了。你东游西逛的，这么晚才回家！我倒奇怪，你为什么不再带个摩尔人回家给你做伴。”说完，她泪如雨下，又是把两只手绞来绞去，又是用手捶胸。“我真是倒了邪霉了！”她呼天抢地地喊道，“真不知以后会有什么下场！家里被律师和警察搜刮一空，丈夫是个窝囊废，不给家里人挣衣食，却白天黑夜瞎转悠，跟异教徒摩尔人在一起胡混！可怜可怜我的孩子吧！可怜可怜我的孩子吧！我们母子该怎么办呢？将来都得上街头要饭去！”

老实巴交的佩雷吉尔见自己的配偶如此伤心，也情不自禁地潸然泪下。他的心里被感情充得满满的，就像他的衣袋里充满了金银珠宝一样，再也憋不住了。于是他把手伸进衣袋，掏出三四枚大金币来，将金币塞进妻子的怀里。可怜的女人诧异得瞪大了两眼，简直不明白这许多金子是从哪儿弄来的。还没等她醒过神来，小个子加里西亚人又掏出一根金链子在她面前晃来晃去，喜滋滋地直跳脚，嘴巴咧得都快到了耳朵根。

“圣母保佑我们吧！”做妻子的高声叫道，“佩雷吉尔，这是怎么回事？这该不是你谋财害命得来的不义之财吧？”

可怜的女人刚一产生这种想法，便认定是铁的事实了。她望见远处有一座监狱和一座绞刑架，仿佛看见小个子罗圈腿加里西亚人就被吊在绞架上，而这一幻想出的恐怖场景吓坏了她，于是她歇斯底里地呼天喊地闹腾起来。

可怜的丈夫真不知如何是好了。他想安抚妻子，让妻子打消脑子里的那些奇怪念头，却觉得别无良策，唯有一吐为快，将他如何遭此好运的经过说了出来。不过，在讲述之前，他让妻子立下极为庄重的誓言，绝不向任何一个人透密。

听了他的讲述，妻子那高兴的劲儿简直用语言无法形容。她伸出两臂，一下子紧紧地搂住丈夫的脖子，差点没把他闷死。“怎么样，老婆？”小个子男人欢天喜地地高声说，“摩尔人留下的遗产，你还有什么可说的？从今往后，我帮助落难的人，你可千万别再骂我了。”

老实巴交的加里西亚人躺到羊皮褥子上睡了，香甜得就像睡在鸭绒上一样。他的妻子却是另外一种情形。只见她把他衣袋里的宝贝全倒在了席子上，坐在那儿又是清点阿拉伯金币，又是试着戴项链和耳环，想象着有朝一日她获准能够享受这些宝贝时，那该是多么的风光。

第二天早晨，老实巴交的加里西亚人拿起一枚大金币跑到市场上，去了一家珠宝店想把它卖掉，假称是从阿尔罕布拉宫的废墟中捡到的。店主见金币上铸着阿拉伯文，是十足的纯金，却只给了他三分之一的价钱，而这位水贩子则十分满足。佩雷吉尔立时给孩子们买了几件新衣和各式各样的玩具，又采购了大量的食品，足够家里人大快朵颐，然后便打道回府。孩子们高兴得围着他跳舞，而他在中间也又蹦又跳的，觉得自己是天下最幸福的父亲。

水贩子的妻子果然守口如瓶，其守诺的严格程度叫人颇觉意外。整整有一天半的时间，她一脸神秘的表情，心里被秘密憋得都快要爆炸了，可是即便身边净是喜欢打听小道消息的人，却一句也没有透露。当然，她免不了会做出一些样子来，为自己的衣衫褴褛而向人表示歉意，说她打算定做一条金线和琉璃珠子镶边的裙子，还要定做一件连披肩的镶边头纱。她还放出风声，说她丈夫的身体状况不适合贩水，准备放弃这一行了。实际上，她还说他们全家要到乡间消夏，让孩子们呼吸山间清新的空气，闷热的夏天待在城里简直叫人受不了。

邻居们你看看我我看看你，都觉得这个穷婆子一定是疯了。她的装腔作势、故作高雅成了大伙儿的笑柄，她一转过身去，人们就拿她开玩笑。

如果说她在外边还克制着自己，进了家门可就要好好做出弥补了。她先把一串贵重的东方珍珠挂在脖子上，又把摩尔式手镯套在腕上，再拣出一顶钻石帽饰戴在头上，穿着她的那身破旧衣服走来走去，时不时还站在一面破镜子前把自己欣赏一番。一次，由于天真的虚荣心驱使，她实在按耐不住冲动，就珠光宝气地走到窗口炫耀，想赢得路人的钦羡。

仿佛是命运之神做出的安排，那个好管闲事的理发匠帕蒂罗·帕德鲁果此时坐在街对面的理发店里，正闲得无聊，他那双警惕的眼睛一下子就看见了钻石射出的光芒。一眨眼的工夫，他就冲到了瞭望窗口，发现水贩子的那个邋遢婆娘一身珠宝，将自己打扮得像个东方的新娘。他把那婆娘身上的珠宝列了一份精确的清单，然后即刻迈开大步向市长家疾奔。没过多大一会儿，那个饿狼似的警官便寻踪追去，不等太阳落山就将不幸的佩雷吉尔抓来见市长了。

“还有什么可说的，无赖！”市长气急败坏地咆哮道，“你曾经对我说那个死在你家里的异教徒什么也没留下，只留下了一个空匣子。而现在我听人说你妻子身穿破烂衣服，却戴满了珠玉、钻石首饰。你这个恶棍！你从那个悲惨的人儿身上得来的不义之财，都给我交出来，然后就等着上绞架吧——绞架早已在那儿候着你呢。”

水贩子被吓得魂飞天外，扑通一声跪倒在地，一五一十将他获得财富的神奇经历交代了一遍。市长、警官以及那个喜欢打听消息的理发匠都贪婪地竖起耳朵，细听这个关于魔法控制宝藏的阿拉伯故事。接着，警官奉命去把那个协助念符咒的摩尔人带了来。那个伊斯兰教徒发现自己最终还是落到了贪得无厌的法律的化身手里，早已吓得半死。后来看到水贩子站在那里，垂眼低眉，一副难为情的神态，他心里就彻底明白是怎么回事了。“可怜虫，”他经过水贩子身边时骂了一句，“我早就警告过你，对你的妻子只字都不能提！”

摩尔人的供词与他同案犯的话完全吻合，市长却假装不信，放出狠话威胁，说要将他们关入大牢彻查此事。

“请息怒，尊敬的市长阁下，”伊斯兰教徒此时已恢复了平日的机智和镇静，于是侃侃说道，“不要坏了兴头。财富人人有份，不必争抢。此事只有在座的几位知道，外人一概不知。咱们大家必须严守这个秘密。地洞里有金银财宝无数，足可以让大家盆满钵满。如果你们答应将得来的东西平分，便可以把里面的财宝悉数运出，否则，地洞就永远也别想打开。”

市长和警官私下商议了一阵。后者是个精于此道的老狐狸，只听他说：“不管什么条件都可以答应。先把那些宝贝弄到手再计较。到时候你可以把东西全扣下。如果他和他的同伴胆敢说个不字，就吓唬他们，说要把他们当作邪教徒和巫师，用火刑烧死他们。”

市长觉得此计大妙，于是变得和颜悦色，走到摩尔人跟前说：“这件事实在太离奇，不过，也许是真的。我必须亲眼见见才能够相信。今天夜里，就请你当着我的面念一念那符咒。如果真有财宝，那咱们就和和气气地平分，此事以后再不提起。假如你骗我，那你就别怪我手下无情了。现在得委屈一下你们，暂时留在此处。”

摩尔人和水贩子欣然同意了他的条件，相信这些条件最终会落实到实处的。

近半夜时分，市长带着警官和好管闲事的理发匠悄悄出发上路了，人人都全副武装。他们把摩尔人和水贩子当作犯人押着一起去，还牵去了水贩子的那头结实有力的毛驴，准备驮走拿到手的财宝。一行人神不知鬼不觉地抵达七层塔，将毛驴拴在一棵无花果树上，然后深入塔下的地洞，进了那第四层石室。

羊皮纸卷取了出来，点亮了黄蜡烛，摩尔人念了符咒。大地像上次那样开始颤抖，接着轰隆一声巨响，地面裂开，露出一段狭窄的石阶。市长、警官和理发匠全吓呆了，谁都没有勇气下去。摩尔人和水贩子相伴到了下边的室内，发现那两个摩尔人仍和从前一样默默无语，一动不动地端坐在那里。他们把两个装满了金币和宝石的大罐子搬过来，由水贩子一个一个扛到外面去。小个子虽说健壮有力，已习惯了扛重物，还是被压得脚步踉跄。当两个罐子放到毛驴的两侧时，他发现毛驴也几乎不堪重负了。

“这一次就到此为止吧，”摩尔人说道，“这些财宝够咱们搬运的了，可别在路上被人看见。这些足够叫咱们成为富人，使咱们人人满意。”

“下边还有别的珠宝吗？”市长问。

“最为值钱的是一个大箱子，”摩尔人说，“里面装满了珍珠和宝石。”

“无论如何也得把那箱子弄上来！”贪得无厌的市长叫嚷道。

“我不想再下去了，”摩尔人执拗地说，“对一个有理智的人来说，这些足够了，再弄就多余了。”

“我也不愿再去扛了，免得把我可怜的毛驴脊背压断。”水贩子说。

市长见自己的命令、威胁和央求一概不顶用，就转过身来对他的两个随从说：“你们俩帮我把箱子抬上来，里面的东西咱们平分。”说完，他带头走下石阶，警官和理发匠战战兢兢、无可奈何地紧随其后。

摩尔人见他们进入地下室，立刻吹灭了黄蜡烛，只听地面又跟从前一样轰隆一声合拢了，将那三位可敬的人物埋在了地底下。

随后，他急匆匆奔上一节节的石阶，一直跑到外边才停了下来。小个子水贩子在他后边甩开两条短腿拼命跑，紧跟了上来。

“你这是怎么啦？”佩雷吉尔刚一喘过气就嚷嚷了起来，“市长和那两个人被关在地下室里了。”

“这是真主的意愿！”摩尔人虔诚地说。

“难道你不放他们出来啦？”加里西亚人问。

“真主禁止他们出来！”摩尔人一面回答，一面捋着自己的胡子。“天书上写着，他们将永远被魔法禁锢在地下，有破禁者出现，才能使他们重见天日。真主之愿不可违！”说完，他一扬手将蜡烛远远地扔进了山谷阴森森的树丛里。

这下子，就是想救那三个人也没门了。摩尔人和水贩子便赶着毛驴，驮着无数金银财宝向城里走去。老实巴交的佩雷吉尔情不自禁地搂住与自己同甘共苦的长耳朵朋友又亲又吻，庆幸它逃离了法律的魔爪。实际上，心地纯朴的小个子简直快乐到了极点，一是因为他获得了这许多珍宝，二是由于毛驴失而复得。

两个走运的伙伴和和气气、公公平平对这笔财富进行了分配。值得一提的是，摩尔人偏爱首饰，于是便将珍珠、宝石及珍玩之类的东西大多划分到了他那一堆财宝里，却以多出五倍的数量把亮晃晃的金银财宝分给水贩子，使得对方极为满意。二人不敢停留，生怕横生枝节，便远走高飞，到别的国家安然享用他们的财富了。摩尔人回到了非洲他的故乡丹吉尔城。加里西亚人带着妻子儿女以及他的毛驴，风风光光地去了葡萄牙。在葡萄牙，受到妻子的训诫和教导，他居然摇身一变成了个显赫人物。妻子叫这小个子在长长的身子上穿一件紧身衣，在短腿上套一双长袜，帽插羽翎，腰挂宝剑，又叫他抛弃旧名佩雷吉尔，改用比较尊贵的名字——堂·佩德罗·吉尔。他的孩子虽然都是矮个头、罗圈腿，但活泼快乐。至于吉尔夫人，那可是浑身上下镶金线、裹花边、挂流苏，每个指头都戴着金光闪闪的戒指，简直就是一个邋遢婆娘穷讲究的典范。

话说那位市长和他的随从，一直被禁锢在七层塔之下，至今仍受到魔法的控制。也许，有朝一日，西班牙需要启用卑鄙的理发匠、如狼似虎的警官和贪污腐败的市长，才会有人打听他们的下落。否则，他们就得耐心等待别人救他们，说不定他们会永受魔法的控制，直至世界末日呢。

Rip Van Winkle


The following Tale was found among the papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker, an old gentleman of New York, who was very curious in the Dutch history of the province and the manners of the descendants from its primitive settlers. His historical researches, however, did not lie so much among books as among men; for the former are lamentably scanty on his favorite topics; whereas he found the old burghers, and still more, their wives, rich in that legendary lore so invaluable to true history. Whenever, therefore, he happened upon a genuine Dutch family, snugly shut up in its low roofed farm house, under a spreading sycamore, he looked upon it as a little clasped volume of black letter, and studied it with the zeal of a bookworm.

The result of all these researches was a history of the province, during the reign of the Dutch governors, which he published some years since. There have been various opinions as to the literary character of his work and, to tell the truth, it is not a whit better than it should be. Its chief merit is its scrupulous accuracy, which indeed was a little questioned on its first appearance, but has since been completely established; and it is now admitted into all historical collections as a book of unquestionable authority.

The old gentleman died shortly after the publication of his work, and now that he is dead and gone, it cannot do much harm to his memory to say that his time might have been much better employed in weightier labors. He, however, was apt to ride his hobby his own way; and though it did now and then kick up the dust a little in the eyes of his neighbors, and grieve the spirit of some friends for whom he felt the truest deference and affection, yet his errors and follies are remembered “more in sorrow than in anger,” and it begins to be suspected that he never intended to injure or offend. But however his memory may be appreciated by criticks, it is still held dear by many folk, whose good opinion is well worth having; particularly by certain biscuit bakers, who have gone so far as to imprint his likeness on their new year cakes, and have thus given him a chance for immortality, almost equal to being stamped on a Waterloo medal, or a Queen Anne's farthing.





Rip Van Winkle


A Posthumous Writing of Diedrich Knickerbocker

By Woden, God of Saxons,

From whence comes Wensday, that is Wodensday,

Truth is a thing that ever I will keep

Unto thylke day in which I creep into

My sepulchre—

CARTWRIGHT.

Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson must remember the Kaatskill mountains. They are a dismembered branch of the great Appalachian family, and are seen away to the west of the river swelling up to noble height and lording it over the surrounding country. Every change of season, every change of weather, indeed, every hour of the day, produces some change in the magical hues and shapes of these mountains, and they are regarded by all the good wives far and near as perfect barometers. When the weather is fair and settled they are clothed in blue and purple, and print their bold outlines on the clear evening sky; but sometimes, when the rest of the landscape is cloudless, they will gather a hood of grey vapors about their summits, which, in the last rays of the setting sun, will glow and light up like a crown of glory.

At the foot of these fairy mountains the voyager may have descried the light smoke curling up from a village, whose shingle roofs gleam among the trees, just where the blue tints of the upland melt away into the fresh green of the nearer landscape. It is a little village of great antiquity, having been founded by some of the Dutch colonists, in the early times of the province, just about the beginning of the government of the good Peter Stuyvesant, (may he rest in peace!) and there were some of the houses of the original settlers standing within a few years, built of small yellow bricks brought from Holland, having latticed windows and gable fronts, surmounted with weathercocks.

In that same village, and in one of these very houses (which to tell the precise truth was sadly time worn and weather beaten) there lived many years since, while the country was yet a province of Great Britain, a simple good natured fellow of the name of Rip Van Winkle. He was a descendant of the Van Winkles who figured so gallantly in the chivalrous days of Peter Stuyvesant, and accompanied him to the siege of Fort Christina. He inherited, however, but little of the martial character of his ancestors. I have observed that he was a simple good natured man; he was, moreover a kind neighbor, and an obedient, henpecked husband. Indeed to the latter circumstance might be owing that meekness of spirit which gained him such universal popularity; for those men are most apt to be obsequious and conciliating abroad, who are under the discipline of shrews at home. Their tempers doubtless are rendered pliant and malleable in the fiery furnace of domestic tribulation, and a curtain lecture is worth all the sermons in the world for teaching the virtues of patience and long suffering. A termagant wife may therefore in some respects be considered a tolerable blessing—and if so, Rip Van Winkle was thrice blessed.

Certain it is that he was a great favorite among all the good wives of the village, who as usual with the amiable sex, took his part in all family squabbles, and never failed, whenever they talked those matters over in their evening gossippings, to lay all the blame on Dame Van Winkle. The children of the village too would shout with joy whenever he approached. He assisted at their sports, made their play things, taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and told them long stories of ghosts, witches and Indians. Whenever he went dodging about the village he was surrounded by a troop of them hanging on his skirts, clambering on his back, and playing a thousand tricks on him with impunity; and not a dog would bark at him throughout the neighborhood.

The great error in Rip's composition was an insuperable aversion to all kinds of profitable labor. It could not be form the want of assiduity or perseverance; for he would sit on a wet rock, with a rod as long and heavy as a Tartar's lance, and fish all day without a murmur, even though he should not be encouraged by a single nibble. He would carry a fowling piece on his shoulder for hours together, trudging through woods, and swamps and up hill and down dale, to shoot a few squirrels or wild pigeons. He would never refuse to assist a neighbor even in the roughest toil, and was a foremost man at all country frolicks for husking Indian corn, or building stone fences; the women of the village too used to employ him to run their errands and to do such little odd jobs as their less obliging husbands would not do for them—in a word Rip was ready to attend to any body's business but his own; but as to doing family duty, and keeping his farm in order, he found it impossible.

In fact he declared it was of no use to work on his farm; it was the most pestilent little piece of ground in the whole country; every thing about it went wrong and would go wrong in spite of him. His fences were continually falling to pieces; his cow would either go astray or get among the cabbages, weeds were sure to grow quicker in his fields than any where else; the rain always made a point of setting in just as he had some out door work to do, So that though his patrimonial estate had dwindled away under his management, acre by acre until there was little more left than a mere patch of Indian corn and potatoes, yet it was the worst conditioned farm in the neighborhood.

His children, too, were as ragged and wild as if they belonged to nobody. His son Rip, an urchin begotten in his own likeness, promised to inherit the habits with the old clothes of his father. He was generally seen trooping like a colt at his mother's heels, equipped in a pair of his father's cast off galligaskins, which he had much ado to hold up with one hand, as a fine lady does her train in bad weather.

Rip Van Winkle, however, was one of those happy mortals of foolish, well oiled dispositions, who take the world easy, eat white bread or brown, whichever can be got with least thought or trouble, and would rather starve on a penny than work for a pound. If left to himself, he would have whistled life away, in perfect contentment, but his wife kept continually dinning in his ears about his idleness, his carelessness and the ruin he was bringing on his family. Morning noon and night her tongue was incessantly going, and every thing he said or did was sure to produce a torrent of household eloquence. Rip had but one way of replying to all lectures of the kind, and that by frequent use had grown into a habit. He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, cast up his eyes, but said nothing. This, however, always provoked a fresh volley from his wife, so that he was fain to draw off his forces and take to the outside of the house—the only side which in truth belongs to a henpecked husband.

Rip's sole domestic adherent was his dog Wolf who was as much henpecked as his master; for Dame Van Winkle regarded them as companions in idleness, and even looked upon Wolf with an evil eye as the cause of his master's going so often astray. True it is, in all points of spirit befitting an honourable dog, he was as courageous an animal as ever scoured the woods—but what courage can withstand the ever during and allbesetting terrors of a woman's tongue? The moment Wolf entered the house his crest fell, his tail drooped to the ground or curled between his legs, he sneaked about with a gallows air, casting many a sidelong glance at Dame Van Winkle, and at the least flourish of a broomstick or ladle he would fly to the door with yelping precipitation.

Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long, lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel the school master, a dapper, learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary; and how sagely they would deliberate upon public events some months after they had taken place.

The opinions of this junto were completely controlled by Nicholaus Vedder, a patriarch of the village, and landlord of the inn, at the door of which he took his seat from morning till night, just moving sufficiently to avoid the sun and keep in the shade of a large tree; so that the neighbours could tell the hour by his movements as accurately as by a sun dial. It is true he was rarely heard to speak, but smoked his pipe incessantly. His adherents, however (for every great man has his adherents), perfectly understood him and knew how to gather his opinions. When any thing that was read or related displeased him, he was observed to smoke his pipe vehemently and to send forth short, frequent and angry puffs; but when pleased he would inhale the smoke slowly and tranquilly and emit it in light and placid clouds, and sometimes taking the pipe from his mouth and letting the fragrant vapor curl about his nose, would gravely nod his head in token of perfect approbation.

From even this strong hold the unlucky Rip was at length routed by his termagant wife who would suddenly break in upon the tranquillity of the assemblage, and call the members all to naought; nor was that august personage Nicholaus Vedder himself, sacred from the daring tongue of this terrible virago, who charged him outright with encouraging her husband in habits of idleness.

Poor Rip was at last reduced almost to despair; and his only alternative, to escape from the labor of the farm and the clamor of his wife, was to take gun in hand, and stroll away into the woods. Here he would sometimes seat himself at the foot of a tree, and share the contents of his wallet with Wolf, with whom he sympathized as a fellow-sufferer in persecution. “Poor Wolf,” he would say, “thy mistress leads thee a dog's life of it; but never mind my lad, whilst I live thou shalt never want a friend to stand by thee!” Wolf would wag his tail, look wistfully in his master's face, and if dogs can feel pity I verily believe he reciprocated the sentiment with all his heart.

In a long ramble of the kind on a fine autumnal day, Rip had unconsciously scrambled to one of the highest parts of the Kaatskill mountains. He was after his favorite sport of squirrel shooting and the still solitudes had echoed and re-echoed with the reports of his gun. Panting and fatigued he threw himself, late in the afternoon, on a green knoll, covered with mountain herbage, that crowned the brow of a precipice. From an opening between the trees he could overlook all the lower country for many a mile of rich woodland. He saw at a distance the lordly Hudson, far, far below him, moving on its silent but majestic course, with the reflection of a purple cloud, or the sail of a lagging bark here and there sleeping on its glassy bosom, and at last losing itself in the blue highlands.

On the other side he looked down into a deep mountain glen, wild, lonely, and shagged, the bottom filled with fragments from the impending cliffs and scarcely lighted by the reflected rays of the setting sun. For some time Rip lay musing on this scene; evening was gradually advancing, the mountains began to throw their long blue shadows over the valleys; he saw that it would be dark, long before he could reach the village; and he heaved a heavy sigh when he thought of encountering the terrors of Dame Van Winkle.

As he was about to descend he heard a voice from a distance hallooing “Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!” He looked around, but could see nothing but a crow winging its solitary flight across the mountain. He thought his fancy must have deceived him and turned again to descend, when he heard the same cry ring through the still evening air: “Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!”—at the same time Wolf bristled up his back and giving a low growl, skulked to his master's side, looking fearfully down into the glen. Rip now felt a vague apprehension stealing over him; he looked anxiously in the same direction and perceived a strange figure slowly toiling up the rocks and bending under the weight of something he carried on his back. He was surprised to see any human being in this lonely and unfrequented place, but supposing it to be some one of the neighborhood in need of his assistance he hastened down to yield it.

On nearer approach he was still more surprised at the singularity of the stranger's appearance. He was a short, square built old fellow, with thick bushy hair and a grizzled beard. His dress was of the antique Dutch fashion, a cloth jerkin strapped round the waist, several pair of breeches, the outer one of ample volume decorated with rows of buttons down the sides and bunches at the knees. He bore on his shoulder a stout keg that seemed full of liquor, and made signs for Rip to approach and assist him with the load. Though rather shy and distrustful of this new acquaintance Rip complied with his usual alacrity; and mutually relieving each other, they clambered up a narrow gully apparently the dry bed of a mountain torrent. As they ascended Rip every now and then heard long rolling peals like distant thunder, that seemed to issue out of a deep ravine or rather cleft between lofty rocks, toward which their rugged path conducted. He paused for an instant, but supposing it to be the muttering of one of those transient thunder showers which often take place in mountain heights, he proceeded. Passing through the ravine they came to a hollow like a small amphitheatre, surrounded by perpendicular precipices, over the brinks of which impending trees shot their branches, so that you only caught glimpses of the azure sky and the bright evening cloud. During the whole time Rip and his companion had labored on in silence, for though the former marvelled greatly what could be the object of carrying a keg of liquor up this wild mountain, yet there was something strange and incomprehensible about the unknown, that inspired awe and checked familiarity.

On entering the amphitheatre new objects of wonder presented themselves. On a level spot in the centre was a company of odd-looking personages playing at ninepins. They were dressed in a quaint outlandish fashion—some wore short doublets, others jerkins, with long knives in their belts and most of them had enormous breeches of similar style with that of the guide's. Their visages too were peculiar. one had a large head, broad face and small piggish eyes. the face of another seemed to consist entirely of nose, and was surmounted by a white sugar loaf hat, set off with a little red cock's tail. They all had beards of various shapes and colors. There was one who seemed to be the commander. He was a stout old gentleman, with a weather-beaten countenance. He wore a laced doublet, broad belt and hanger, high-crowned hat and feather, red stockings, and high heel'd shoes with roses in them. The whole group reminded Rip of the figures in an old Flemish painting, in the parlor of Dominie Van Schaick the village parson, and which had been brought over from Holland at the time of the settlement.

What seemed particularly odd to Rip was, that though these folks were evidently amusing themselves, yet they maintained the gravest faces, the most mysterious silence, and were, withal, the most melancholy party of pleasure he had ever witnessed. Nothing interrupted the stillness of the scene, but the noise of the balls, which, whenever they were rolled, echoed along the mountains like rumbling peals of thunder.

As Rip and his companion approached them they suddenly desisted from their play, and stared at him with such fixed statue like gaze, and such strange uncouth, lack lustre countenances, that his heart turned within him, and his knees smote together. His companion now emptied the contents of the keg into large flagons and made signs to him to wait upon the company. He obeyed with fear and trembling; they quaffed the liquor in profound silence and then returned to their game.

By degrees Rip's awe and apprehension subsided. He even ventured, when no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found had much of the flavor of excellent hollands. He was naturally a thirsty soul and was soon tempted to repeat the draught. One taste provoked another, and he reiterated his visits to the flagon so often that at length his senses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head—his head gradually declined and he fell into a deep sleep.

On awaking he found himself on the green knoll from whence he had first seen the old man of the glen. He rubbed his eyes—it was a bright, sunny morning. The birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes, and the eagle was wheeling aloft and breasting the pure mountain breeze. “Surely,” thought Rip, “I have not slept here all night.” He recalled the occurrences before he fell asleep. The strange man with a keg of liquor—the mountain ravine—the wild retreat among the rocks—the woe begone party at ninepins—the flagon—“ah! that flagon! that wicked flagon!” thought Rip—“what excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?”

He looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean well oiled fowling piece he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel encrusted with rust; the lock falling off and the stock worm-eaten. He now suspected that the grave roysters of the mountain had put a trick upon him, and, having dosed him with liquor, had robbed him of his gun. Wolf too had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a squirrel or partridge. He whistled after him and shouted his name—but all in vain; the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was to be seen.

He determined to revisit the scene of the last evening's gambol, and if he met with any of the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he a rose to walk he found himself stiff in the joints and wanting in his usual activity. “These mountain beds do not agree with me,” thought Rip, “and if this frolick, should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism, I shall have a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle.” With some difficulty he got down into the glen: he found the gully up which he and his companion had ascended the preceding evening, but to his astonishment a mountain stream was now foaming down it; leaping from rock to rock, and filling the glen with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift to scramble up its sides working his toilsome way through thickets of birch, sassafras and witch hazel, and sometimes tripped up or entangled by the wild grape vines that twisted their coils and tendrils from tree to tree, and spread a kind of net work in his path.

At length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the cliffs to the amphitheatre-but no traces of such opening remained. The rocks presented a high impenetrable wall over which the torrent came tumbling in a sheet of feathery foam, and fell into a broad deep basin black from the shadows of the surrounding forest. Here then poor Rip was brought to a stand. He again called and whistled after his dog—he was only answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows, sporting high in air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice; and who, secure in their elevation seemed to look down and scoff at the poor man's perplexities. What was to be done? The morning was passing away and Rip felt famished for want of his breakfast. He grieved to give up his dog and gun; he dreaded to meet his wife; but it would not do to starve among the mountains. He shook his head, shouldered the rusty fire lock and with a heart full of trouble and anxiety, turned his steps homeward.

As he approached the village he met a number of people, but none whom he new, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself acquainted with every one in the country round. Their dress too was of a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed. They all stared at him with equal marks of surprise, and whenever they cast their eyes upon him, invariably stroked their chins. The constant recurrence of this gesture induced Rip involuntarily to do the same, when to his astonishment he found his beard had grown a foot long!

He had now entered the skirts of the village. A troop of strange children ran at his heels, hooting after him and pointing at his gray beard. The dogs too, not one of which he recognized for an old acquaintance, barked at him as he passed. The very village was altered—it was larger and more populous. There were rows of houses which he had never seen before, and those which had been his familiar haunts had disappeared. Strange names were over the doors—strange faces at the windows—every thing was strange. His mind now misgave him; he began to doubt whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched. Surely this was his native village which he had left but the day before. There stood the Kaatskill mountains—there ran the silver Hudson at a distance—there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always been—Rip was sorely perplexed—“That flagon last night,” thought he, “has addled my poor head sadly!”

It was with some difficulty that he found the way to his own house, which he approached with silent awe, expecting every moment to hear the shrill voice of Dame Van Winkle. He found the house gone to decay—the roof fallen in, the windows shattered and the doors off the hinges. A half starved dog that looked like Wolf was skulking about it. Rip called him by name, but the cur snarled, shewed his teeth and passed on. This was an unkind cut indeed—“My very dog,” sighed poor Rip, “has forgotten me!”

He entered the house, which, to tell the truth, Dame Van Winkle had always kept in neat order. It was empty, forlorn and apparently abandoned. This desolateness overcame all his connubial fears—he called loudly for his wife and children—the lonely chambers rung for a moment with his voice, and then all again was silence.

He now hurried forth and hastened to his old resort, the village inn—but it too was gone. A large, ricketty wooden building stood in its place, with great gaping windows, some of them broken, and mended with old hats and petticoats, and over the door was painted “The Union Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle.” Instead of the great tree, that used to shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, there now was reared a tall naked pole, with some thing on top that looked like a red nightcap, and from it was fluttering a flag on which was a singular assemblage of stars and stripes—all this was strange and incomprehensible. He recognized on the sign, however, the ruby face of King George under which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe, but even this was singularly metamorphosed. The red coat was changed for one of blue and buff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a sceptre; the head was decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was printed in large characters GENERAL WASHINGTON.

There was as usual a crowd of folk about the door; but none that Rip recollected. The very character of the people seemed changed. There was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it, instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquillity. He looked in vain for the sage Nicholaus Vedder with his broad face, double chin and fair long pipe, uttering clouds of tobacco smoke instead of idle speeches. Or Van Bummel the schoolmaster doling forth the contents of an ancient newspaper. In place of these a lean bilious looking fellow, with his pockets full of hand bills, was haranguing vehemently about rights of citizens—elections—members of Congress—liberty—Bunker's hill—heroes of seventy six—and other words which were a perfect Babylonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.

The appearance of Rip, with his long grizzled beard, his rusty fowling piece his uncouth dress and an army of women and children at his heels soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They crowded around him eying him from head to foot, with great curiosity. The orator bustled up to him, and drawing him partly aside, enquired “on which side he voted?”—Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but busy little fellow, pulled him by the arm and rising on tiptoe, enquired in his ear, “whether he was Federal or Democrat?” Rip was equally at a loss to comprehend the question—when a knowing, self important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way through the crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as he passed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo, the other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating as it were into his very soul, demanded in an austere tone—“What brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder and a mob at his heels; and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?” “Alas! gentlemen,” cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, “I am a poor quiet man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the King—God bless him!”

Here a general shout burst from the byestanders “A tory! a tory! a spy! a Refugee! hustle him! away with him!”—It was with great difficulty that the self important man in the cocked hat restored order; and having assumed a ten fold austerity of brow demanded again of the unknown culprit, what he came there for and whom he was seeking. The poor man humbly assured him that he meant no harm; but merely came there in search of some of his neighbors, who used to keep about the tavern.

“—Well—who are they?—name them.”

Rip bethought himself a moment and einquired, “Where's Nicholas Vedder?”

There was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied, in a thin, piping voice, “Nicholaus Vedder? why he is dead and gone these eighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the church yard that used to tell all about him, but that's rotten and gone too.”

“Where's Brom Dutcher?”

“Oh he went off to the army in the beginning of the war; some say he was killed at the storming of Stoney Point—others say he was drowned in a squall at the foot of Antony's Nose—I don't know—he never came back again.”

“Where's Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?”

“He went off to the wars too—was a great militia general, and is now in Congress.”

Rip's heart died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home and friends, and finding himself thus alone in the world—every answer puzzled him too by treating of such enormous lapses of time and of matters which he could not understand—war—Congress, Stony Point—he had no courage to ask after any more friends, but cried out in despair, “Does nobody here know Rip Van Winkle?”

“Oh. Rip Van Winkle?” exclaimed two or three—“Oh to be sure! that's Rip Van Winkle—yonder leaning against the tree.”

Rip looked and beheld a precise counterpart of himself, as he went up the mountain; apparently as lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his own identity, and whether he was himself or another man. In the midst of his bewilderment the man in the cocked hat demanded who he was, —what was his name?

“God knows,” exclaimed he, at his wit's end, “I'm not myself—I'm somebody else—that's me yonder—no—that's somebody else got into my shoes—I was myself last night; but I fell asleep on the mountain—and they've changed my gun—and every thing's changed, and I'm changed—and I can't tell what's my name, or who I am!”

The by standers began now to look at each other, nod, wink significantly and tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was a whisper also about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from doing mischief—at the very suggestion of which, the self important man in the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical moment a fresh likely looking woman pressed through the throng to get a peep at the gray bearded man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which, frightened at his looks began to cry. “Hush Rip,” cried she, “hush, you little fool, the old man won't hurt you.” The name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone of her voice all awakened a train of recollections in his mind.

“What is your name my good woman?” asked he.

“Judith Cardenier.”

“And your father's name?”

“Ah, poor man, Rip Van Winkle was his name, but it's twenty years since he went away from home with his gun and never has been heard of since—his dog came home without him—but whether he shot himself, or was carried away by the Indians nobody can tell. I was then but a little girl.”

Rip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a—faltering voice—

“Where's your mother?”—

Oh she too had died but a short time since—she broke a blood vessel in a fit of passion at a New England pedlar.—

There was a drop of comfort at least in this intelligence. The honest man could contain himself no longer—he caught his daughter and her child in his arms.—“I am your father!” cried he—“Young Rip Van Winkle once—old Rip Van Winkle now!—'does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle!”

All stood amazed, until an old woman tottering out from among the crowd put her hand to her brow and peering under it in his face for a moment exclaimed—“Sure enough!—it is Rip Van Winkle—it is himself—Welcome home again old neighbor—Why, where have you been these twenty long years?”

Rip's story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him but as one night. The neighbors stared when they heard it; some were seen to wink at each other and put their tongues in their cheeks, and the self important man in the cocked hat, who when the alarm was over had returned to the field, screwed down the corners of his mouth and shook his head—upon which there was a general shaking of the head throughout the assemblage.

It was determined, however, to take the opinion of old Peter Vanderdonk, who was seen slowly advancing up the road. He was a descendant of the historian of that name, who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the province. Peter was the most ancient inhabitant of the village and well versed in all the wonderful events and traditions of the neighborhood. He recollected Rip at once, and corroborated his story in the most satisfactory manner. He assured the company that it was a fact handed down from his ancestor the historian, that the Kaatskill mountains had always been haunted by strange beings. That it was affirmed that the great Hendrick Hudson, the first discoverer of the river and country, kept a kind of vigil there every twenty years, with his crew of the Half Moon—being permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of his enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon the river and the great city called by his name. That his father had once seen them in their old Dutch dresses playing at nine pins in a hollow of the mountain; and that he himself had heard one summer afternoon the sound of their balls, like distant peals of thunder.

To make a long story short—the company broke up, and returned to the more important concerns of the election. Rip's daughter took him home to live with her; she had a snug well furnished house, and a stout cheery farmer for a husband whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that used to climb upon his back. As to Rip's son and heir, who was the ditto of himself seen leaning against the tree, he was employed to work on the farm; but evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to any thing else but his business.

Rip now resumed his old walks and habits; he soon found many of his former cronies, though all rather the worse for the wear and tear of time; and preferred making friends among the rising generation, with whom he soon grew into great favor.

Having nothing to do at home, and being arrived at that happy age when a man can be idle, with impunity, he took his place once more on the bench at the inn door and was reverenced as one of the patriarchs of the village and a chronicle of the old times “before the war.” It was some time before he could get into the regular track of gossip, or could be made to comprehend the strange events that had taken place during his torpor. How that there had been a revolutionary war—that the country had thrown off the yoke of Old England and that, instead of being a subject of his majesty George the Third, he was now a free citizen of the United States. Rip in fact was no politician; the changes of states and empires made but little impression on him; but there was one species of despotism under which he had long groaned and that was petticoat government. Happily that was at an end—he had got his neck out of the yoke of matrimony, and could go in and out whenever he pleased, without dreading the tyranny of Dame Van Winkle. Whenever her name was mentioned, however, he shook his head, shrugged his shoulders and cast up his eyes; which might pass either for an expression of resignation to his fate or joy at his deliverance.

He used to tell his story to every stranger that arrived at Mr. Doolittle's Hotel. He was observed at first to vary on some points every time he told it, which was, doubtless owing to his having so recently awaked. It at last settled down precisely to the tale I have related and not a man woman or child in the neighborhood but knew it by heart. Some always pretended to doubt the reality of it, and insisted that Rip had been out of his head, and that this was one point on which he always remained flighty. The old Dutch inhabitants, however, almost universally gave it full credit. Even to this day they never hear a thunder storm of a summer afternoon about the Kaatskill, but they say Hendrick Hudson and his crew are at their game of nine pins; and it is a common wish of all henpecked husbands in the neighborhood, when life hangs heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught out of Rip Van Winkle's flagon.





Note


The foregoing tale one would suspect had been suggested to Mr. Knickerbocker by a little German superstition about the emperor Frederick der Rothbart and the Kypphauser Mountain; the subjoined note, however, which he had appended to the tale, shews that it is an absolute fact, narrated with his usual fidelity.—

“The story of Rip Van Winkle may seem incredible to many, but nevertheless I give it my full belief, for I know the vicinity of our old Dutch settlements to have been very subject to marvellous events and appearances. Indeed I have heard many stranger stories than this, in the villages along the Hudson; all of which were too well authenticated to admit of a doubt. I have even talked with Rip Van Winkle myself, who when last I saw him was a very venerable old man and so perfectly rational and consistent on every other point, that I think no conscientious person could refuse to take this into the bargain—nay I have seen a certificate on the subject taken before a country justice and signed with across in the justice's own hand writing. The story therefore is beyond the possibility of doubt. D. K.”





Postscript


The following are travelling notes from a memorandum book of Mr. Knickerbocker.

The Kaatsberg or Catskill mountains have always been a region full of fable. The Indians considered them the abode of spirits who influenced the weather, spreading sunshine or clouds over the landscape and sending good or bad hunting seasons. They were ruled by an old squaw spirit, said to be their mother. She dwelt on the highest peak of the Catskills and had charge of the doors of day and night to open and shut them at the proper hour. She hung up the new moons in the skies and cut up the old ones into stars. In times of drought, if properly propitiated, she would spin light summer clouds out of cobwebs and morning dew, and send them off, from the crest of the mountain, flake after flake, like flakes of carded cotton to float in the air: until, dissolved by the heat of the sun, they would fall in gentle showers, causing the grass to spring, the fruits to ripen and the corn to grow an inch an hour. If displeased, however, she would brew up clouds black as ink, sitting in the midst of them like a bottle bellied spider in the midst of its web; and when these clouds broke—woe betide the valleys!

In old times say the Indian traditions, there was a kind of Manitou or Spirit, who kept about the wildest recesses of the Catskill mountains, and took a mischievous pleasure in wreaking all kinds of evils and vexations upon the red men. Sometimes he would assume the form of a bear a panther or a deer, lead the bewildered hunter a weary chace through tangled forests and among rugged rocks; and then spring off with a loud ho! ho! leaving him aghast on the brink of a beetling precipice or raging torrent.

The favorite abode of this Manitou is still shewn. It is a gteat rock or cliff in the loneliest part of the mountains, and, from the flowering vines which clamber about it, and the wild flowers which abound in its neighborhood, is known by the name of the Garden Rock. Near the foot of it is a small lake the haunt of the solitary bittern, with water snakes basking in the sun on the leaves of the pond lilies which lie on the surface. This place was held in great awe by the Indians, insomuch that the boldest hunter would not pursue his game within its precincts. Once upon a time, however, a hunter who had lost his way, penetrated to the garden rock where he beheld a number of gourds placed in the crotches of trees. One of these he seized and made off with it, but in the hurry of his retreat he let it fall among the rocks, when a great stream gushed forth which washed him away and swept him down precipices where he was dashed to pieces, and the stream made its way to the Hudson and continues to flow to the present day; being the identical stream known by the name of the Kaaters-kill.





The Spectre Bridegroom


A Traveller's Tale(1)

He that supper for is dight,

He lyes full cold, I trow, this night!

Yestreen to chamber I him led,

This night Gray-steel has made his bed!

SIR EGER, SIR GRAHAME, AND SIR GRAY-STEEL.

On the summit of one of the heights of the Odenwald, a wild and romantic tract of upper Germany, that lies not far from the confluence of the Main and the Rhine, there stood, many, many years since, the Castle of the Baron Von Landshort. It is now quite fallen to decay, and almost buried among beech trees and dark firs, above which, however, its old watch tower may still be seen struggling, like the former possessor I have mentioned, to carry a high head, and look down upon the neighboring country.

The Baron was a dry branch of the great family of Katzenellen-bogen(2), and inherited the reliques of the property, and all the pride of his ancestors. Though the warlike disposition of his predecessors had much impaired the family possessions, yet the Baron still endeavored to keep up some show of former state. The times were peaceable, and the German nobles, in general, had abandoned their inconvenient old castles, perched like eagles' nests among the mountains, and had built more convenient residences in the valleys; still the Baron remained proudly drawn up in his little fortress, cherishing with hereditary inveteracy, all the old family feuds; so that he was on ill terms with some of his nearest neighbors, on account of disputes that had happened between their great great grandfathers.

The Baron had but one child, a daughter; but nature, when she grants but one child, always compensates by making it a prodigy; and so it was with the daughter of the Baron. All the nurses, gossips, and country cousins, assured her father that she had not her equal for beauty in all Germany; and who should know better than they. She had, moreover, been brought up with great care under the superintendance of two maiden aunts, who had spent some years of their early life at one of the little German courts, and were skilled in all the branches of knowledge necessary to the education of a fine lady. Under their instructions, she became a miracle of accomplishments. By the time she was eighteen she could embroider to admiration, and had worked whole histories of the saints in tapestry, with such strength of expression in their countenances, that they looked like so many souls in purgatory. She could read without great difficulty, and had spelled her way through several Church legends, and almost all the chivalric wonders of the Heldenbuch. She had even made considerable proficiency in writing, could sign her own name without missing a letter, and so legibly, that her aunts could read it without spectacles. She excelled in making little elegant good for nothing lady like nick-nacks of all kinds; was versed in the most abstruse dancing of the day; played a number of airs on the harp and guitar; and knew all the tender ballads of the Minne-lieders by heart.

Her aunts, too, having been great flirts and coquettes in their younger days, were admirably calculated to be vigilant guardians and strict censors of the conduct of their niece; for there is no duenna so rigidly prudent, and inexorably decorous, as a superannuated coquette. She was rarely suffered out of their sight; never went beyond the domains of the castle, unless well attended, or rather, well watched; had continual lectures read to her about strict decorum and implicit obedience; and, as to the men—pah!—she was taught to hold them at such distance and in such absolute distrust, that, unless properly authorized, she would not have cast a glance upon the handsomest cavalier in the world—no, not if he were even dying at her feet!

The good effects of this system were wonderfully apparent. The young lady was a pattern of docility and correctness. While others were wasting their sweetness in the glare of the world, and liable to be plucked and thrown aside by every hand, she was coyly blooming into fresh and lovely womanhood under the protection of those immaculate spinsters, like a rose bud blushing forth among guardian thorns. Her aunts looked upon her with pride and exultation, and vaunted that, though all the other young ladies in the world might go astray, yet thank heaven, nothing of the kind could happen to the heiress of Katzenellenbogen.

But, however scantily the Baron Von Landshort might be provided with children, his household was by no means a small one, for Providence had enriched him with abundance of poor relations. They, one and all, possessed the affectionate disposition common to humble relatives: were wonderfully attached to the Baron, and took every possible occasion to come in swarms and enliven the castle. All family festivals were commemorated by these good people at the Baron's expense; and when they were filled with good cheer, they would declare that there was nothing on earth so delightful as these family meetings, these jubilees of the heart.

The Baron, though a small man, had a large soul, and it swelled with satisfaction at the consciousness of being the greatest man in the little world about him. He loved to tell long stories about the stark old warriors whose portraits looked grimly down from the walls around, and he found no listeners equal to those who fed at his expense. He was much given to the marvellous, and a firm believer in all those supernatural tales with which every mountain and valley in Germany abounds. The faith of his guests exceeded even his own: they listened to every tale of wonder with open eyes and mouth, and never failed to be astonished, even though repeated for the hundredth time. Thus lived the Baron Von Landshort, the oracle of his table, the absolute monarch of his little territory, and happy above all things, in the persuasion that he was the wisest man of the age.

At the time of which my story treats, there was a great family gathering at the Castle I on an affair of the utmost importance. It was to receive the destined bridegroom of the Baron's daughter. A negotiation had been carried on between the father, and an old nobleman of Bavaria, to unite the dignity of their houses by the marriage of their children. The preliminaries had been conducted with proper punctilio. The young people were betrothed without seeing each other, and the time was appointed for the marriage ceremony. The young Count Von Altenburg had been recalled from the army for the purpose, and was actually on his way to the Baron's to receive his bride. Missives had even been received from him, from Wurtzburg, where he was accidentally detained, mentioning the day and hour when he might be expected to arrive.

The castle was in a tumult of preparation to give him a suitable welcome. The fair bride had been decked out with uncommon care. The two aunts had superintended her toilet, and quarrelled the whole morning about every article of her dress. The young lady had taken advantage of their contest to follow the bent of her own taste; and fortunately it was a good one. She looked as lovely as youthful bridegroom could desire; and the flutter of expectation heightened the lustre of her charms.

The suffusions that mantled her face and neck, the gentle heaving of the bosom, the eye now and then lost in reverie, all betrayed the soft tumult that was going on in her little heart. The aunts were continually hovering around her; for maiden aunts are apt to take great interest in affairs of this nature. They were giving her a world of staid counsel how to deport herself, what to say, and in what manner to receive the expected lover.

The Baron was no less busied in preparations. He had, in truth, nothing exactly to do; but he was naturally a fuming, bustling little man, and could not remain passive when all the world was in a hurry. He worried from top to bottom of the castle, with an air of infinite anxiety; he continually called the servants from their work to exhort them to be diligent, and buzzed about every hall and chamber, as idly restless and importunate as a blue bottle fly on a warm summer's day.

In the mean time, the fatted calf had been killed; the forests had rung with the clamor of the huntsmen; the kitchen was crowded with good cheer; the cellars had yielded up whole oceans of Rhein-wein and Ferne-wein; and even the great Heidelberg tun had been laid under contribution. Every thing was ready to receive the distinguished guest with Saus und Braus in the true spirit of German hospitality—but the guest delayed to make his appearance. Hour rolled after hour. The sun that had poured his downward rays upon the rich forests of the Odenwald, now just gleamed along the summits of the mountains. The Baron mounted the highest tower, and strained his eyes in hopes of catching a distant sight of the count and his attendants. Once he thought he beheld them; the sound of horns came floating from the valley, prolonged by the mountain echoes. A number of horsemen were seen far below, slowly advancing along the road; but when they had nearly reached the foot of the mountain, they suddenly struck off in a different direction. The last ray of sunshine departed—the bats began to flit by in the twilight—the road grew dimmer and dimmer to the view; and nothing appeared stirring in it, but now and then a peasant lagging homeward from his labor.

While the old castle of Landshort was in this state of perplexity, a very interesting scene was transacting in a different part of the Odenwald.

The young Count Von Altenburg was tranquilly pursuing his route in that sober jog trot way in which a man travels towards matrimony, when his friends have taken all the trouble and uncertainty of courtship off his hands, and a bride is waiting for him, as—certainly as a dinner, at the end of his journey. He had encountered, at Wurtzburg, a youthful companion in arms, with whom he had seen some service on the frontiers; Herman Von Starkenfaust, one of the stoutest hands, and worthiest hearts, of German chivalry, who was now returning from the army. His father's castle was not far distant from the old fortress of Landshort, although an hereditary feud rendered the families hostile, and strangers to each other.

In the warm hearted moment of recognition, the young friends related all their past adventures and fortunes, and the count gave the whole history of his intended nuptials with a young lady whom he had never seen, but of whose charms he had received the most enrapturing descriptions.

As the route of the friends lay in the same direction, they agreed to perform the rest of their journey together; and that they might do it the more leisurely, set off from Wurtzburg at an early hour, the count having given directions for his retinue to follow and overtake him.

They beguiled their wayfaring with recollections of their military scenes and adventures; but the count was apt to be a little tedious, now and then, about the reputed charms of his bride, and the felicity that awaited him.

In this way they had entered among the mountains of the Odenwald, and were traversing one of its most lonely and thickly wooded passes. It is well known that the forests of Germany have always been as much infested by robbers as its castles by spectres; and, at this time, the former were particularly numerous, from the hordes of disbanded soldiers wandering about the country. It will not appear extraordinary, therefore, that the cavaliers were attacked by a gang of these stragglers, in the midst of the forest. They defended themselves with bravery, but were nearly overpowered, when the count's retinue arrived to their assistance. At sight of them the robbers fled, but not until the count had received a mortal wound. He was slowly and carefully conveyed back to the city of Wurtzburg, and a friar summoned from a neighboring convent, who was famous for his skill in administering to both soul and body. But half of his skill was superfluous; the moments of the unfortunate count were numbered.

With his dying breath he entreated his friend to repair instantly to the castle of Landshort, and explain the fatal cause of his not keeping his appointment with his bride. Though not the most ardent of lovers, he was one of the most punctilious of men; and appeared earnestly solicitous that this mission should be speedily and courteously executed. “Unless this is done,” said he, “I shall not sleep quietly in my grave!” He repeated these last words with peculiar solemnity. A request at a moment so impressive, admitted no hesitation. Starkenfaust endeavored to soothe him to calmness, promised faithfully to execute his wish, and gave him his hand in solemn pledge. The dying man pressed it in acknowledgment, but soon lapsed into delirium—raved about his bride—his engagement—his plighted word; ordered his horse, that he might ride to the castle of Landshort, and expired in the fancied act of vaulting into the saddle.

Starkenfaust bestowed a sigh, and a soldier's tear, on the untimely fate of his comrade; and then pondered on the awkward mission he had undertaken. His heart was heavy, and his head perplexed; for he was to present himself an unbidden guest among hostile people, and to damp their festivity with tidings fatal to their hopes. Still there were certain whisperings of curiosity in his bosom to see this far famed beauty of Katzenellenbogen, so cautiously shut up from the world; for he was a passionate admirer of the sex, and there was a dash of eccentricity and enterprise in his character that made him fond of all singular adventure.

Previous to his departure, he made all due arrangements with the holy fraternity of the convent for the funeral solemnities of his friend, who was to be buried in the cathedral of Wurtzburg, near some of his illustrious relatives; and the mourning retinue of the count took charge of his remains.

It is now high time that we should return to the ancient family of Katzenellenbogen, who were impatient for their guest, and still more for their dinner; and to the worthy little Baron, whom we left airing himself on the watch tower.

Night closed in, but still no guest arrived. The Baron descended from the tower in despair. The banquet, which had been delayed from hour to hour could no longer be postponed. The meats were already overdone; the cook in an agony; and the whole household had the look of a garrison that had been reduced by famine. The Baron was obliged reluctantly to give orders for the feast without the presence of the guest. All were seated at table, and just on the point of commencing, when the sound of a horn from without the gate gave notice of the approach of a stranger. Another long blast filled the old courts of the castle with its echoes, and was answered by the warder from the walls. The Baron hastened to receive his future son in law.

The drawbridge had been let down, and the stranger was before the gate. He was a tall gallant cavalier, mounted on a black steed. His countenance was pale, but he had a beaming, romantic eye, and an air of stately melancholy. The Baron was a little mortified that he should have come in this simple, solitary style. His dignity for a moment was ruffled, and he felt disposed to consider it a want of proper respect for the important occasion, and the important family with which he was to be connected. He, however, pacified himself, with the conclusion that it must have been youthful impatience which had induced him thus to spur on sooner than his attendants.

“I am sorry,” said the stranger, “to break in upon you thus unseasonably—”

Here the Baron interrupted him with a world of compliments and greetings; for, to tell the truth, he prided himself upon his courtesy and his eloquence. The stranger attempted, once or twice, to stem the torrent of words, but in vain, so he bowed his head and suffered it to flow on. By the time the Baron had come to a pause, they had reached the inner court of the castle; and the stranger was again about to speak, when he was once more interrupted by the appearance of the female part of the family, leading forth the shrinking and blushing bride. He gazed on her for a moment as one entranced; it seemed as if his whole soul beamed forth in the gaze, and rested upon that lovely form. One of the maiden aunts whispered something in her ear; she made an effort to speak; her moist blue eye was timidly raised, gave a shy glance of inquiry on the stranger, and was cast again to the ground. The words died away; but there was a sweet smile playing about her lips, and a soft dimpling of the cheek, that showed her glance had not been unsatisfactory. It was impossible for a girl of the fond age of eighteen, highly predisposed for love and matrimony, not to be pleased with so gallant a cavalier.

The late hour at which the guest had arrived, left no time for parley. The Baron was peremptory, and deferred all particular conversation until the morning, and led the way to the untasted banquet.

It was served up in the great hall of the castle. Around the walls hung the hard favored portraits of the heroes of the house of Katzenellenbogen, and the trophies which they had gained in the field and in the chase. Hacked corslets; splintered jousting spears, and tattered banners, were mingled with the spoils of sylvan warfare: the jaws of the wolf, and the tusks of the boar, grinned horribly among cross bows and battle axes, and a huge pair of antlers branched immediately over the head of the youthful bridegroom.

The cavalier took but little notice of the company, or the entertainment. He scarce tasted the banquet, but seemed absorbed in admiration of his bride. He conversed in a low tone that could not be overheard—for the language of love is never loud; but where is the female ear so dull that it cannot catch the softest whisper of the lover? There was a mingled tenderness and gravity in his manner, that appeared to have a powerful effect upon the young lady. Her color came and went as she listened with deep attention. Now and then she made some blushing reply, and when his eye was turned away, she would steal a side long glance at his romantic countenance, and heave a gentle sigh of tender happiness. It was evident that the young couple were completely enamored. The aunts, who were deeply versed in the mysteries of the heart, declared that they had fallen in love with each other at first sight.

The feast went on merrily, or at least noisily, for the guests were all blessed with those keen appetites that attend upon light purses and mountain air. The Baron told his best and longest stories, and never had he told them so well, or with such great effect. If there was any thing marvellous, his auditors were lost in astonishment; and if any thing facetious, they were sure to laugh exactly in the right place. The Baron, it is true, like most great men, was too dignified to utter any joke but a dull one; it was always enforced, however, by a bumper of excellent Hochheimer, and even a dull joke at one's own table, served up with jolly old wine, is irresistible. Many good things were said by poorer and keener wits, that would not bear repeating, except on similar occasions; many sly speeches whispered in ladies' ears, that almost convulsed them with suppressed laughter; and a song or two roared out by a poor, but merry and broad faced cousin of the Baron, that absolutely made the maiden aunts hold up their fans.

Amidst all this revelry, the stranger guest maintained a most singular and unseasonable gravity. His countenance assumed a deeper cast of dejection as the evening advanced, and, strange as it may appear, even the Baron's jokes seemed only to render him the more melancholy. At times he was lost in thought, and at times there was a perturbed and restless wandering of the eye that bespoke a mind but ill at ease. His conversations with the bride became more and more earnest and mysterious. Lowering clouds began to steal over the fair serenity of her brow, and tremors to run through her tender frame.

All this could not escape the notice of the company. Their gayety was chilled by the unaccountable gloom of the bridegroom; their spirits were infected; whispers and glances were interchanged, accompanied by shrugs and dubious shakes of the head. The song and the laugh grew less and less frequent: there were dreary pauses in the conversation, which were at length succeeded by wild tales, and supernatural legends. One dismal story produced another still more dismal, and the Baron nearly frightened some of the ladies into hysterics with the history of the goblin horseman that carried away the fair Leonora; a dreadful, but true story which has since been put into excellent verse, and is read and believed by all the world.

The bridegroom listened to this tale with profound attention. He kept his eyes steadily fixed on the Baron, and as the story drew to a close, began gradually to rise from his seat, growing taller and taller, until, in the Baron's entranced eye, he seemed almost to tower into a giant. The moment the tale was finished, he heaved a deep sigh, and took a solemn farewell of the company. They were all amazement. The Baron was perfectly thunderstruck.

“What! going to leave the castle at midnight? Why, every thing was prepared for his reception: a chamber was ready for him if he wished to retire.”

The stranger shook his head mournfully, and mysteriously: “I must lay my head in a different chamber tonight!”

There was something in this reply, and the tone in which it was uttered, that made the Baron's heart misgive him; but he rallied his forces and repeated his hospitable entreaties.

The stranger shook his head silently, but positively, at every offer, and waving his farewell to the company, stalked slowly out of the hall. The maiden aunts were absolutely petrified—the bride hung her head, and a tear stole to her eye.

The Baron followed the stranger to the great court of the castle, where the black charger stood pawing the earth, and snorting with impatience. When they had reached the portal, whose deep archway was dimly lighted by a cresset, the stranger paused, and addressed the Baron in a hollow tone of voice, which the vaulted roof rendered still more sepulchral.

“Now that we are alone,” said he, “I will impart to you the reason of my going. I have a solemn, an indispensable engagement——”

“Why,” said the Baron, “cannot you send some one in your place?”

“It admits of no substitute—I must attend it in person—I must away to Wurtzburg cathedral——”

“Aye,” said the Baron, plucking up spirit, “but not until tomorrow—tomorrow you shall take your bride there.”

“No! no!” replied the stranger, with tenfold solemnity, “my engagement is with no bride—the worms! the worms expect me! I am a dead man—I have been slain by robbers—my body lies at Wurtzburg—at midnight I am to be buried—the grave is waiting for me—I must keep my appointment!”

He sprang on his black charger, dashed over the drawbridge, and the clattering of his horse's hoofs was lost in the whistling of the night blast.

The Baron returned to the hall in the utmost consternation, and related what had passed. Two ladies fainted outright, others sickened at the idea of having banquetted with a spectre. It was the opinion of some, that this might be the wild huntsman, famous in German legend. Some talked of mountain sprites, of wooddemons, and of other supernatural beings, with which the good people of Germany have been so grievously harassed since time immemorial. One of the poor relations ventured to suggest that it might be some sportive evasion of the young cavalier, and that the very gloominess of the caprice seemed to accord with so melancholy a personage. This, however, drew on him the indignation of the whole company, and especially of the Baron, who looked upon him as little better than an infidel; so that he was fain to abjure his heresy as speedily as possible, and come into the faith of the true believers.

But, whatever may have been the doubts entertained, they were completely put to an end by the arrival, next day, of regular missives, confirming the intelligence of the young Count's murder and, his interment in Wurtzburg cathedral.

The dismay at the castle may well be imagined. The Baron shut himself up in his chamber. The guests who had come to rejoice with him, could not think of abandoning him in his distress. They wandered about the courts, or collected in groups in the hall, shaking their heads and shrugging their shoulders, at the troubles of so good a man; and sat longer than ever at table, and ate and drank more stoutly than ever, by way of keeping up their spirits. But the situation of the widowed bride was the most pitiable. To have lost a husband before she had even embraced him—and such a husband! If the very spectre could be so gracious and noble, what must have been the living man! She filled the house with lamentations.

On the night of the second day of her widowhood she had retired to her chamber, accompanied by one of her aunts, who insisted on sleeping with her. The aunt, who was one of the best tellers of ghost stories in all Germany, had just been recounting one of her longest, and had fallen asleep in the very midst of it. The chamber was remote, and overlooked a small garden. The niece lay pensively gazing at the beams of the rising moon, as they trembled on the leaves of an aspen tree before the lattice. The castle clock had just tolled midnight, when a soft strain of music stole up from the garden. She rose hastily from her bed, and stepped lightly to the window. A tall figure stood among the shadows of the trees. As it raised its head, a beam of moonlight fell upon the countenance. Heaven and earth! she beheld the Spectre Bridegroom! A loud shriek at that moment burst upon her ear, and her aunt, who had been awakened by the music, and had followed her silently to the window, fell into her arms. When she looked again, the spectre had disappeared.

Of the two females, the aunt now required the most soothing, for she was perfectly beside herself with terror. As to the young lady, there was something, even in the spectre of her lover, that seemed endearing. There was still the semblance of manly beauty; and though the shadow of a man is but little calculated to satisfy the affections of a love sick girl, yet, where the substance is not to be had, even that is consoling. The aunt declared she would never sleep in that chamber again; the niece, for once, was refractory, and declared as strongly that she would sleep in no other in the castle: the consequence was, that she had to sleep in it alone; but she drew a promise from her aunt not to relate the story of the spectre, lest she should be denied the only melancholy pleasure left her on earth—that of inhabiting the chamber over which the guardian shade of her lover kept its nightly vigils.

How long the good old lady would have observed this promise is uncertain, for she dearly loved to talk of the marvellous, and there is a triumph in being the first to tell a frightful story; it is, however, still quoted in the neighborhood, as a memorable instance of female secrecy, that she kept it to herself for a whole week, when she was suddenly absolved from all further restraint, by intelligence brought to the breakfast table one morning, that the young lady was not to be found. Her room was empty—the bed had not been slept in—the window was open, and the bird had flown!

The astonishment and concern with which the intelligence was received, can only be imagined by those who have witnessed the agitation which the mishaps of a great man cause among his friends. Even the poor relations paused for a moment from the indefatigable labors of the trencher; when the aunt, who had at first been struck speechless, wrung her hands and shrieked out, “The goblin! the goblin! she's carried away by the goblin!”

In a few words she related the fearful scene of the garden, and concluded that the spectre must have carried off his bride. Two of the domestics corroborated the opinion, for they had heard the clattering of a horse's hoofs down the mountain about midnight, and had no doubt that it was the spectre on his black charger, bearing her away to the tomb. All present were struck with the direful probability; for events of the kind are extremely common in Germany, as many well authenticated histories bear witness.

What a lamentable situation was that of the poor Baron! What a heartrending dilemma for a fond father, and a member of the great family of Katzenellenbogen! His only daughter had either been rapt away to the grave, or he was to have some wood demon for a son in law, and, perchance, a troop of goblin grand children. As usual, he was completely bewildered, and all the castle in an uproar. The men were ordered to take horse, and to scour every road, and path, and glen of the Odenwald. The Baron himself had just drawn on his jack boots, girded on his sword, and was about to mount his steed to sally forth on the doubtful quest, when he was brought to a pause by a new apparition. A lady was seen approaching the castle, mounted on a palfrey, attended by a cavalier on horseback. She galloped up to the gate, sprang from her horse, and falling at the Baron's feet, embraced his knees. It was his lost daughter, and her companion—the Spectre Bridegroom! The Baron was astounded. He looked at his daughter, then at the Spectre, and almost doubted the evidence of his senses. The latter, too, was wonderfully improved in his appearance, since his visit to the world of spirits. His dress was splendid, and set off a noble figure of manly symmetry. He was no longer pale and melancholy. His fine countenance was flushed with the glow of youth, and joy rioted in his large dark eye.

The mystery was soon cleared up. The cavalier (for in truth, as you must have known all the while, he was no goblin) announced himself as Sir Herman Von Starkenfaust. He related his adventure with the young Count. He told how he had hastened to the castle to deliver the unwelcome tidings, but that the eloquence of the Baron had interrupted him in every attempt to tell his tale. How the sight of the bride had completely captivated him, and that to pass a few hours near her, he had tacitly suffered the mistake to continue. How he had been sorely perplexed in what way to make a decent retreat, until the Baron's goblin stories had suggested his eccentric exit. How, fearing the feudal hostility of the family, he had repeated his visits by stealth—had haunted the garden beneath the young lady's window—had wooed—had won—had borne away in triumph—and, in a word, had wedded the fair.

Under any other circumstances, the Baron would have been inflexible, for he was tenacious of paternal authority, and devoutly obstinate in all family feuds; but he loved his daughter; he had lamented her as lost; he rejoiced to find her still alive; and, though her husband was of a hostile house, yet, thank heaven! he was not a goblin. There was something, it must be acknowledged, that did not exactly accord with his notions of strict veracity, in the joke the knight had passed upon him of his being a dead man; but several old friends present, who had served in the wars, assured him that every stratagem was excusable in love, and that the cavalier was entitled to especial privilege, having lately served as a trooper.

Matters, therefore, were happily arranged. The Baron pardoned the young couple on the spot. The revels at the castle were resumed. The poor relations overwhelmed this new member of the family with loving kindness; he was so gallant, so generous, and so rich. The aunts, it is true, were somewhat scandalized that their system of strict seclusion, and passive obedience, should be so badly exemplified, but attributed it all to their negligence in not having the windows grated. One of them was particularly mortified at having her marvellous story marred, and that the only spectre she had ever seen should turn out a counterfeit; but the niece seemed perfectly happy at having found him substantial flesh and blood-and so the story ends.

The Legend of Sleepy Hollow


(Found among the Papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker)

A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,

Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;

And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,

Forever flushing round a summer sky.

CASTLE OF INDOLENCE.

In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappaan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail, and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley, or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose, and the occasional whistle of a quail, or tapping of a woodpecker, is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.

I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel shooting was in a grove of tall walnut trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noon time, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around, and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat, whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.

From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys through out all the neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by a high German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs; are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the night mare, with her whole nine fold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.

The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander in chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon ball, in some nameless battle during the revolutionary war, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk, hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege, that the body of the trooper having been buried in the church yard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the church yard before day break.

Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known, at all the country firesides, by the name of The Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.

It is remarkable, that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative—to dream dreams, and see apparitions.

I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud; for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the great state of New York, that population, manners, and customs, remain fixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still water, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom.

In this by place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, “tarried,” in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity. He was a native of Connecticut, a state which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters. The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather cock perched upon his spindle neck, to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.

His school house was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copy books. It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the window shutters; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment in getting out; an idea most probably borrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eelpot. The school house stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable birch tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low murmur of his pupils' voices conning over their lessons, might be heard of a drowsy summer's day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command, or peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, “Spare the rod and spoil the child.” Ichabod Crane's scholars certainly were not spoiled.

I would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school, who joy in the smart of their subjects; on the contrary, he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burthen off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong. Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied, by inflicting a double portion on some little, tough, wrong headed, broad skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called “doing his duty by their parents;” and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting urchin, that “he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live.”

When school hours were over, he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys; and on holyday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard. Indeed, it behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils. The revenue arising from his school was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and though lank, had the dilating powers of an Anaconda; but to help out his maintenance, he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers, whose children he instructed. With these he lived successively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.

That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burthen, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make hay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from pasture, and cut wood for the winter fire. He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway, with which he lorded it in his little empire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating. He found favor in the eyes of the mothers, by petting the children, particularly the youngest, and like the lion bold, which whilome so magnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a cradle with his foot, for whole hours together.

In addition to his other vocations, he was the singing master of the neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him on Sundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away the palm from the parson. Certain it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation, and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite to the opposite side of the mill pond, on a still Sunday morning, which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane. Thus, by diverse little make shifts, in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated “by hook and by crook,” the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.

The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood, being considered a kind of idle gentleman like personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the person. His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea table of a farm house, and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver tea pot. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the church yard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overrun the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones, or sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent mill pond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior elegance and address.

From his half itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house; so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's History of New England Witchcraft, in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently believed.

He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity. His appetite for the marvellous, and his powers of digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his residence in this spell bound region. No tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow. It was often his delight, after his school was dismissed of an afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover, bordering the little brook that whimpered by his school house, and there con over old Mather's direful tales, until the gathering dusk of evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he wended his way by, swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farm house where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination: the moan of the whip-poor-will(1) from the hill side; the boding cry of the tree toad, that harbinger of storm; the dreary hooting of the screech owl; or the sudden rustling in the thicket, of birds frightened from their roost. The fire flies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token. His only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought, or drive away evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes; and the good people of Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with awe, at hearing his nasal melody, “in linked sweetness long drawn out,” floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.

Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was, to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and sputtering along the hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him. He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and would frighten them wofully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars, and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!

But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show its face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk homewards. What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path, amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night!—With what wistful look did he eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant window!—How often was he appalled by some shrub covered with snow, which like a sheeted spectre beset his very path!—How often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look over his shoulder, lest he should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him! and how often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees, in the idea that it was the gallopping Hessian on one of his nightly scourings.

All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind, that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time, and been more than once beset by Satan in diverse shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his works, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man, than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together, and that was—a woman.

Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in each week, to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer. She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a partridge; ripe and melting and rosy cheeked as one of her father's peaches, and universally famed, not merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a little of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off her charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her great great grandmother had brought over from Saardam; the tempting stomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.

Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart toward the sex; and it is not to be wondered at, that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those every thing was snug, happy, and well conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His strong,hold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks, in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well, formed of a barrel, and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among elders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farm house was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings, or buried in their bosoms, and others, swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farm yard, and guinea fowls fretting about it like ill tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior, and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings, and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart—sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.

The pedagogue's mouth watered, as he looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind's eye, he pictured to himself every roasting pig running about with a pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce; in the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey, but he beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back, in a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter, which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.

As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burthened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of children, mounted on the top of a waggon loaded with household trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee, or the Lord knows where!

When he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It was one of those spacious farm houses, with high ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers. The low, projecting eaves formed a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence. Here, rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool ready to be spun; in another a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar, gave him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw footed chairs, and dark mahogany tables, shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock oranges and conch shells decorated the mantlepiece; strings of various colored birds, eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well mended china.

From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight errant of yore, who seldom had any thing but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with; and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant, to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie, and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were for ever presenting new difficulties and impediments, and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.

Among these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rung with his feats of strength and hardihood. He was broad shouldered and double jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff, but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb, he had received the nick name of BROM BONES, by which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock fights, and with the ascendancy which bodily strength acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone admitting of no gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a frolick; but had more mischief than ill will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail, and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farm houses at midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks, and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, “aye, there goes Brom Bones and his gang!” The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good will; and, when any mad cap prank, or rustic brawl, occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.

This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes. Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel's paling, on a Sunday night, (a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed, “sparking,” within,) all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other quarters.

Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired. He had, however, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature; he was in form and spirit like a supple jack—yielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke; and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet, the moment it was away—jerk!—he was as erect, and carried his head as high as ever.

To have taken the field openly against his rival, would have been madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more than that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made his advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner. Under cover of his character of singing master, he made frequent visits at the farm house; not that he had any thing to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a stumbling block in the path of lovers. Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe, and like a reasonable man, and an excellent father, let her have her way in every thing. His notable little wife too, had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry, for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves. Thus while the busy dame bustled about the house, or plied her spinning wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn. In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover's eloquence.

I profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won. To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for a man must battle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts, is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette, is indeed a hero. Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoutable Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently declined: his horse was no longer seen tied at the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.

Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have carried matters to open warfare, and have settled their pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners, the knights errant of yore—by single combat; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him; he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would “double the schoolmaster up, and lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse;” and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival. Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones, and his gang of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked out his singing school, by stopping up the chimney; broke into the school house at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there. But what was still more annoying, Brom took all opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had a scoundrel dog, whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod's, to instruct her in psalmody.

In this way, matters went on for some time, without producing any material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers. On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails, behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers; while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half munched apples, popguns, whirligigs, fly cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper game cocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the school room. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow cloth jacket and trowsers, a round crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry making, or “quilting frolick,” to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel's, and having delivered his message with that air of importance, and effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his mission.

All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet school room. The scholars were hurried through their lessons, without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble, skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed, or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside, without being put away on the shelves; inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time; bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green, in joy at their early emancipation.

The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and arranging his looks by a bit of broken looking glass, that hung up in the school house. That he might make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman, of the name of Hans Van Ripper, and thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like a knight errant in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was a broken down plough horse, that had outlived almost every thing but its viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burrs; one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master's, the cholerick Van Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own spirit into the animal, for, old and broken down as he looked, there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in the country.

Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers'; he carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a sceptre, and as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings. A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horse's tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed, as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad day light.

It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day, the sky was clear and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet. Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech and hickory nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble field.

The small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the fullness of their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking, from bush to bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety around them. There was the honest cock robin, the favorite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds; and the golden winged woodpecker, with his crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar bird, with its red tipt wings and yellow tipt tail, and its little monteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his gay light blue coat and white under clothes, screaming and chattering, nodding, and bobbing, and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove.

As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn. On all sides he beheld vast store of apples, some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market, others heaped up in rich piles for the cider press. Further on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields breathing the odor of the bee hive, and as he beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slap jacks, well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.

Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and “sugared suppositions,” he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson. The sun gradually wheeled his broad disk down into the west. The wide bosom of the Tappaan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain: a few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the mid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth to the dark grey and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging uselessly against the mast, and as the reflection of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the air.

It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the adjacent country. Old farmers, a spare, leathern faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes and magnificent pewter buckles. Their brisk withered little dames in close crimped caps, long waisted short gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and pincushions, and gay calico pockets, hanging on the outside. Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine ribband, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation. The sons, in short square skirted coats, with rows of stupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eel skin for the purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair.

Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the gathering on his favorite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage. He was in fact noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all kinds of tricks, which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for he held a tractable well broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.

Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state parlor of Van Tassel's mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white: but the ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea table, in the sumptuous time of autumn. Such heaped up platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced Dutch housewives. There was the doughty dough nut, the tenderer oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of cakes. And then there were apple pies and peach pies and pumpkin pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with the motherly tea pot sending up its clouds of vapor from the midst—Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story. Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but did ample justice to every dainty.

He was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with eating, as some men's do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor. Then, he thought, how soon he'd turn his back upon the old school house; snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors that should dare to call him comrade!

Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated with content and good humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to “fall to, and help themselves.”

And now the sound of the music from the common room or hall, summoned to the dance. The musician was an old grey headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century. His instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater part of the time he scraped away on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the ground, and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.

Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal powers. Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle, and to have seen his loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you would have thought Saint Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person. He was the admiration of all the negroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous; the lady of his heart was his partner in the dance; and smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings, while Brom Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.

When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the sager folks, who, with old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the piazza, gossipping over former times, and drawling out long stories about the war.

This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men. The British and American line had run near it during the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of marauding, and been infested with refugees, cow boys, and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each story teller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of every exploit.

There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large, blue bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge. And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who in the battle of White plains, being an excellent master of defence, parried a musket ball with a small sword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and glance off at the hilt: in proof of which, he was ready at any time to show the sword, with the hilt a little bent. There were several more who had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy termination.

But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that succeeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the kind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered, long settled retreats; but are trampled under foot, by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of our country places. Besides, there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarce had time to finish their first nap, and turn themselves in their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighborhood, so that when they turn out of a night to walk the rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long established Dutch communities.

The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories in these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow. There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel's, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mournful cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major André was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood. Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the headless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling the country; and it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the church yard.

The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, surrounded by locust trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity, beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the day time; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman, and the place where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they gallopped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge, when the horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree tops with a clap of thunder.

This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the gallopping Hessian as an arrant jockey. He affirmed, that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing-Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they came to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash of fire.

All these tales, told in that drowsy undert one with which men talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sunk deep in the mind of Ichabod. He repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added many very marvellous events that had taken place in his native state of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.

The revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered together their families in their wagons, and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills. Some of the damsels, mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their light hearted laughter mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter until they gradually died away—and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted. Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have a tête-à-tête with the heiress; fully convinced that he was now on the high road to success. What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know. Something, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chopfallen—Oh these women! these women! Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?—Was her encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival?—Heaven only knows, not I!—Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been sacking a hen roost, rather than a fair lady's heart. Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth, on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to the stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks, roused his steed most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of timothy and clover.

It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy hearted and crest fallen, pursued his travel homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as dismal as himself. Far below him the Tappaan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under the land. In the dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking of the watch dog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful companion of man. Now and then, too, the long drawn crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farm house away among the hills—but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bull frog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably, and turning suddenly in his bed.

All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon, now came crowding upon his recollection. The night grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and dismal. He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid. In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of land mark. Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into the air. It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate André, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known by the name of Major André's tree. The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights, and doleful lamentations, told concerning it.

As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought his whistle was answered: it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches. As he approached a little nearer, he thought he saw something white, hanging in the midst of the tree: he paused and ceased whistling, but on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly he heard a groan—his teeth chattered, and his knees smote against the saddle: it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.

About two hundred yards from the tree, a small brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and thickly wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley's Swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge, was the severest trial. It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate André was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.

As he approached the stream, his heart began to thump; he, however, summoned up all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starvelling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen, black and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.

The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror. What was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late; and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind? Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he demanded in stammering accents—“who are you?” He received no reply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. —Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound, stood at once in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.

Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the gallopping Hessian, now quickened his steed, in hopes of leaving him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace; Ichabod pulled up, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind—the other did the same. His heart began to sink within him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion, that was mysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow traveller in relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror struck, on perceiving that he was headless! but his horror was still more increased, on observing, that the head, which should have rested on the shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of his saddle! His terror rose to desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, hoping, by a sudden movement, to give his companion the slip—but the spectre started full jump with him. Away, then, they dashed, through thick and thin; stones flying, and sparks flashing, at every bound. Ichabod's flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse's head, in the eagerness of his flight.

They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong down hill to the left. This road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story, and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.

As yet the panic of the steed had given his unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the chace, but just as he had got half way through the hollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt it slipping from under him; he seized it by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under foot by his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper's wrath passed across his mind—for it was his Sunday saddle; but this was no time for petty fears: the goblin was hard on his haunches; and (unskilful rider that he was!) he had much ado to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse's back bone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder.

An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the Church Bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected the place where Brom Bones' ghostly competitor had disappeared. “If I can but reach that bridge,” thought Ichabod, “I am safe.” Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprung upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side, and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash—he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind.—

The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master's gate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast—dinner hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod, and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the church, was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses' hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.

The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper, as executor of his estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy small clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes, full of dog's ears; and a broken pitch pipe. As to the books and furniture of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting Cotton Mather's History of Witchcraft, a New England Almanack, and a book of dreams and fortune telling, in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted, in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel. These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper, who from that time forward determined to send his children no more to school, observing, that he never knew any good come of this same reading and writing. Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and he had received his quarter's pay but a day or two before, he must have had about his person at the time of his disappearance.

The mysterious event caused much speculation at the Church on the following Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the church yard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found. The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of others, were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them all, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook their heads, and came to the conclusion, that Ichabod had been carried off by the gallopping Hessian. As he was a bachelor, and in nobody's debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him, the school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow, and another pedagogue reigned in his stead.

It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the country; had kept school and studied law at the same time; had been admitted to the bar, turned politician, electioneered, written for the newspapers, and finally had been made a justice of the Ten Pound Court. Brom Bones too, who, shortly after his rival's disappearance, conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell.

The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these matters, maintain to this day, that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire. The bridge became more than ever an object of superstitious awe, and that may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by the border of the millpond. The schoolhouse being deserted, soon fell to decay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue; and the plowgh boy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.





POSTSCRIPT


Found in the Handwriting of Mr. Knickerbocker

The preceding Tale is given, almost in the precise words in which I heard it related at a corporation meeting of the ancient city of Manhattoes, at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers. The narrator was a pleasant, shabby, gentlemanly old fellow, in pepper and salt clothes, with a sadly humourous face, and one whom I strongly suspected of being poor, he made such efforts to be entertaining. When his story was concluded, there was much laughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen, who had been asleep the greater part of the time. There was, however, one tall, dry looking old gentleman, with beetling eye brows, who maintained a grave and rather severe face throughout; now and then folding his arms, inclining his head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a doubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men, who never laugh but upon good grounds—when they have reason and the law on their side. When the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided, and silence was restored, he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair, and sticking the other akimbo, demanded, with a slight, but exceedingly sage motion of the head, and contraction of the brow, what was the moral of the story, and what it went to prove. The story teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips, as a refreshment after his toils, paused for a moment, looked at his inquirer with an air of infinite deference, and lowering the glass slowly to the table, observed, that the story was intended most logically to prove,

“That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and pleasures, provided we will but take a joke as we find it:

“That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers, is likely to have rough riding of it:

“Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress, is a certain step to high preferment in the state.” The cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this explanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism; while methought the one in pepper and salt eyed him with something of a triumphant leer. At length he observed, that all this was very well, but still he thought the story a little on the extravagant—there were one or two points on which he had his doubts. “Faith, sir,” replied the story teller, “as to that matter, I don't believe one half of it myself.”

The Devil and Tom Walker


A few miles from Boston, in Massachusetts, there is a deep inlet winding several miles into the interior of the country from Charles Bay, and terminating in a thickly wooded swamp, or morass. On one side of this inlet is a beautiful dark grove; on the opposite side the land rises abruptly from the water's edge, into a high ridge on which grow a few scattered oaks of great age and immense size. Under one of these gigantic trees, according to old stories, there was a great amount of treasure Kidd the pirate. The inlet allowed a facility to bring the money in a boat secretly and at night to the very foot of the hill. The elevation of the place permitted a good look out to be kept that no one was at hand, while the remarkable trees formed good landmarks by which the place might easily be found again. The old stories add, moreover, that the devil presided at the hiding of the money, and took it under his guardianship; but this, it is well known, he always does with buried treasure, particularly when it has been ill gotten. Be that as it may, Kidd never returned to recover his wealth; being shortly after seized at Boston, sent out to England, and there hanged for a pirate. About the year 1727, just at the time when earthquakes were prevalent in New England, and shook many tall sinners down upon their knees, there lived near this place a meagre miserly fellow of the name of Tom Walker. He had a wife as miserly as himself; they were so miserly that they even conspired to cheat each other. Whatever the woman could lay hands on she hid away: a hen could not cackle but she was on the alert to secure the new laid egg. Her husband was continually prying about to detect her secret hoards, and many and fierce were the conflicts that took place about what ought to have been common property. They lived in a forlorn looking house, that stood alone and had an air of starvation. A few straggling savin trees, emblems of sterility, grew near it; no smoke ever curled from its chimney; no traveller stopped at its door. A miserable horse, whose ribs were as articulate as the bars of a gridiron, stalked about a field where a thin carpet of moss, scarcely covering the ragged beds of pudding stone, tantalized and balked his hunger; and sometimes he would lean his head over the fence, look piteously at the passer by, and seem to petition deliverance from this land of famine. The house and its inmates had altogether a bad name. Tom's wife was a tall termagant, fierce of temper, loud of tongue, and strong of arm. Her voice was often heard in wordy warfare with her husband; and his face sometimes showed signs that their conflicts were not confined to words. No one ventured, however, to interfere between them; the lonely wayfarer shrank within himself at the horrid clamor and clapper clawing; eyed the den of discord askance, and hurried on his way, rejoicing, if a bachelor, in his celibacy.

One day that Tom Walker had been to a distant part of the neighborhood, he took what he considered a short cut homewards through the swamp. Like most short cuts, it was an ill chosen route. The swamp was thickly grown with great gloomy pines and hemlocks, some of them ninety feet high; which made it dark at noon day, and a retreat for all the owls of the neighborhood. It was full of pits and quagmires, partly covered with weeds and mosses; where the green surface often betrayed the traveller into a gulf of black smothering mud; there were also dark and stagnant pools, the abodes of the tadpole, the bull frog, and the water snake, where trunks of pines and hemlocks lay half drowned, half rotting, looking like alligators, sleeping in the mire.

Tom had long been picking his way cautiously through this treacherous forest; stepping from tuft to tuft of rushes and roots which afforded precarious footholds among deep sloughs; or pacing carefully, like a cat, along the prostrate trunks of trees; startled now and then by the sudden screaming of the bittern, or the quacking of a wild duck, rising on the wing from some solitary pool. At length he arrived at a piece of firm ground, which ran out like a peninsula into the deep bosom of the swamp. It had been one of the strongholds of the old Indians during their wars with the first colonists. Here they had thrown up a kind of fort which they had looked upon as almost impregnable, and had used as a place of refuge for their squaws and children. Nothing remained of the Indian fort but a few embankments gradually sinking to the level of the surrounding earth, and already overgrown in part by oaks and other forest trees, the foliage of which formed a contrast to the dark pines and hemlocks of the swamp.

It was late in the dusk of evening when Tom Walker reached the old fort, and he paused there for a while to rest himself. Any one but he would have felt unwilling to linger in this lonely melancholy place, for the common people had a bad opinion of it from the stories handed down from the time of the Indian wars; when it was asserted that the savages held incantations here and made sacrifices to the evil spirit. Tom Walker, however, was not a man to be troubled with any fears of the kind.

He reposed himself for some time on the trunk of a fallen hemlock, listening to the boding cry of the tree toad, and delving with his walking staff into a mound of black mould at his feet. As he turned up the soil unconsciously, his staff struck against something hard. He raked it out of the vegetable mould, and lo! a cloven skull with an Indian tomahawk buried deep in it, lay before him. The rust on the weapon showed the time that had elapsed since this death blow had been given. It was a dreary memento of the fierce struggle that had taken place in this last foothold of the Indian warriors.

“Humph!” said Tom Walker, as he gave the skull a kick to shake the dirt from it.

“Let that skull alone!” said a gruff voice.

Tom lifted up his eyes and beheld a great black man, seated directly Opposite him on the stump of a tree. He was exceedingly surprised, having neither seen nor heard any one approach, and he was still more perplexed on observing, as well as the gathering gloom would permit, that the stranger was neither negro nor Indian. It is true, he was dressed in a rude, half Indian garb, and had a red belt or sash swathed round his body, but his face was neither black nor copper color, but swarthy and dingy and begrimed with soot, as if he had been accustomed to toil among fires and forges. He had a shock of coarse black hair, that stood out from his head in all directions; and bore an axe on his shoulder.

He scowled for a moment at Tom with a pair of great red eyes.

“What are you doing on my grounds?” said the black man, with a hoarse growling voice.

“Your grounds?” said Tom, with a sneer; “no more your grounds than mine: they belong to Deacon Peabody.”

“Deacon Peabody be d——d,” said the stranger, “as I flatter myself he will be, if he does not look more to his own sins and less to those of his neighbors. Look yonder, and see how Deacon Peabody is faring.”

Tom looked in the direction that the stranger pointed, and beheld one of the great trees, fair and flourishing without, but rotten at the core, and saw that it had been nearly hewn through, so that the first high wind was likely to blow it down. On the bark of the tree was scored the name of Deacon Peabody, an eminent man, who had waxed wealthy by driving shreud bargains with the Indians. He now looked round and found most of the tall trees marked with the name of some great man of the colony, and all more or less scored by the axe. The one on which he had been seated, and which had evidently just been hewn down, bore the name of Crowninshield; and he recollected a mighty rich man of that name, who made a vulgar display of wealth, which it was whispered he had acquired by buccaneering.

“He's just ready for burning!” said the black man, with a growl of triumph. “You see I am likely to have a good stock of firewood for winter.”

“But what right have you,” said Tom, “to cut down Deacon Peabody's timber?”

“The right of prior claim,” said the other. “This woodland belonged to me long before one of your white faced race put foot upon the soil.”

“And pray, who are you, if I may be so bold?” said Tom. “Oh, I go by various names. I am the Wild Huntsman in some countries; the Black Miner in others. In this neighborhood I am known by the name of the Black Woodsman. I am he to whom the red men consecrated this spot, and in honour of whom they now and then roasted a white man by way of sweet smelling sacrifice. Since the red men have been exterminated by you white savages, I amuse myself by presiding at the persecutions of quakers and anabaptists; I am the great patron and prompter of slave dealers, and the grand master of the Salem witches.” “The upshot of all which is, that, if I mistake not,” said Tom, sturdily, “you are he commonly called Old Scratch.”

“The same at your service!” replied the black man, with a half civil nod.

Such was the opening of this interview, according to the old story, though it has almost too familiar an air to be credited. One would think that to meet with such a singular personage in this wild lonely place, would have shaken any man's nerves: but Tom was a hard minded fellow, not easily daunted, and he had lived so long with a termagant wife, that he did not even fear the devil.

It is said that after this commencement, they had a long and earnest conversation together, as Tom returned homewards. The black man told him of great sums of money buried by Kidd the pirate, under the oak trees on the high ridge not far from the morass. All these were under his command and protected by his power, so that none could find them but such as propitiated his favor. These he offered to place within Tom Walker's reach, having conceived an especial kindness for him: but they were to be had only on certain conditions. What these conditions were, may easily be surmised, though Tom never disclosed them publicly. They must have been very hard, for he required time to think of them, and he was not a man to stick at trifles where money was in view. When they had reached the edge of the swamp the stranger paused.

“What proof have I that all you have been telling me is true?” said Tom.

“There is my signature,” said the black man, pressing his finger on Tom's forehead. So saying, he turned off among the thickets of the swamp, and seemed, as Tom said, to go down, down, down, into the earth, until nothing but his head and shoulders could be seen, and so on until he totally disappeared.

When Tom reached home he found the black print of a finger burnt, as it were, into his forehead, which nothing could obliterate.

The first news his wife had to tell him was the sudden death of Absalom Crowninshield the rich buccaneer. It was announced in the papers with the usual flourish, that “a great man had fallen in Israel.”

Tom recollected the tree which his black friend had just hewn down, and which was ready for burning. “Let the freebooter roast,” said Tom, “who cares!” He now felt convinced that all he had heard and seen was no illusion.

He was not prone to let his wife into his confidence; but as this was an uneasy secret, he willingly shared it with her. All her avarice was awakened at the mention of hidden gold, and she urged her husband to comply with the black man's terms and secure what would make them wealthy for life. However Tom might have felt disposed to sell himself to the devil, he was determined not to do so to oblige his wife; so he flatly refused out of the mere spirit of contradiction. Many and bitter were the quarrels they had on the subject, but the more she talked the more resolute was Tom not to be damned to please her. At length she determined to drive the bargain on her own account, and if she succeeded, to keep all the gain to herself.

Being of the same fearless temper as her husband, she set off for the old Indian fort towards the close of a summer's day. She was many hours absent. When she came back she was reserved and sullen in her replies. She spoke something of a black man whom she had met about twilight, hewing at the root of a tall tree. He was sulky, however, and would not come to terms; she was to go again with a propitiatory offering, but what it was she forbore to say.

The next evening she set off again for the swamp, with her apron heavily laden. Tom waited and waited for her, but in vain: midnight came, but she did not make her appearance; morning, noon, night returned, but still she did not come. Tom now grew uneasy for her safety; especially as he found she had carried off in her apron the silver teapot and spoons and every portable article of value. Another night elapsed, another morning came; but no wife. In a word, she was never heard of more.

What was her real fate nobody knows, in consequence of so many pretending to know. It is one of those facts which have become confounded by a variety of historians. Some asserted that she lost her way among the tangled mazes of the swamp and sank into some pit or slough; others, more uncharitable, hinted that she had eloped with the household booty, and made off to some other province; while others assert that the tempter had decoyed her into a dismal quagmire on top of which her hat was found lying. In confirmation of this, it was said a great black man with an axe on his shoulder was seen late that very evening coming out of the swamp, carrying a bundle tied in a check apron, with an air of surly triumph. The most current and probable story, however, observes that Tom Walker grew so anxious about the fate of his wife and his property that he set out at length to seek them both at the Indian fort. During a long summer's afternoon he searched about the gloomy place, but no wife was to be seen. He called her name repeatedly, but she was no where to be heard. The bittern alone responded to his voice, as he flew screaming by; or the bull frog croaked dolefully from a neighboring pool. At length, it is said, just in the brown hour of twilight, when the owls began to hoot and the bats to flit about, his attention was attracted by the clamor of carrion crows hovering about a cypress tree. He looked up and beheld a bundle tied in a check apron and hanging in the branches of the tree; with a great vulture perched hard by, as if keeping watch upon it. He leaped with joy, for he recognized his wife's apron, and supposed it to contain the household valuables.

“Let us get hold of the property,” said he, consolingly to himself, “and we will endeavor to do without the woman.”

As he scrambled up the tree the vulture spread its wide wings, and sailed off screaming into the deep shadows of the forest. Tom seized the check apron, but, woful sight! found nothing but a heart and liver tied up in it.

Such, according to the most authentic old story, was all that was to be found of Tom's wife. She had probably attempted to deal with the black man as she had been accustomed to deal with her husband; but though a female scold is generally considered a match for the devil, yet in this instance she appears to have had the worst of it. She must have died game however: for it is said Tom noticed many prints of cloven feet deeply stamped about the tree, and found handsful of hair, that looked as if they had been plucked from the coarse black shock of the woodsman. Tom knew his wife's prowess by experience. He shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the signs of a fierce clapper clawing. “Egad,” said he to himself, “Old Scratch must have had a tough time of it!”

Tom consoled himself for the loss of his property with the loss of his wife; for he was a man of fortitude. He even felt something like gratitude towards the black woodsman, who he considered had done him a kindness. He sought, therefore, to cultivate a further acquaintance with him, but for some time without success; the old black legs played shy, for whatever people may think, he is not always to be had for calling for; he knows how to play his cards when pretty sure of his game. At length, it is said, when delay had whetted Tom's eagerness to the quick, and prepared him to agree to any thing rather than not gain the promised treasure, he met the black man one evening in his usual woodman dress, with his axe on his shoulder, sauntering along the edge of the swamp, and humming a tune. He affected to receive Tom's advance with great indifference, made brief replies, and went on humming his tune.

By degrees, however, Tom brought him to business, and they began to haggle about the terms on which the former was to have the pirate's treasure. There was one condition which need not be mentioned, being generally understood in all cases where the devil grants favors; but there were others about which, though of less importance, he was inflexibly obstinate. He insisted that the money found through his means should be employed in his service. He proposed, therefore, that Tom should employ it in the black traffick; that is to say, that he should fit out a slave ship. This, however, Tom resolutely refused; he was bad enough in all conscience; but the devil himself could not tempt him to turn slave dealer.

Finding Tom so squeamish on this point, he did not insist upon it, but proposed instead that he should turn usurer; the devil being extremely anxious for the increase of usurers, looking upon them as his peculiar people.

To this no objections were made, for it was just to Tom's taste.

“You shall open a broker's shop in Boston next month,” said the black man.

“I'll do it tomorrow, if you wish,” said Tom Walker.

“You shall lend money at two percent. a month.”

“Egad, I'll charge four!” replied Tom Walker. “You shall extort bonds, foreclose mortgages, drive the merchant to bankruptcy—”

“I'll drive him to the d—l,” cried Tom Walker, eagerly. “You are the usurer for my money!” said the black legs, with delight. “When will you want the rhino?”

“This very night.”

“Done!” said the devil.

“Done!” said Tom Walker.—So they shook hands, and struck a bargain. A few days' time saw Tom Walker seated behind his desk in a counting house in Boston. His reputation for a ready moneyed man, who would lend money out for a good consideration, soon spread abroad. Every body remembers the days of Governor Belcher, when money was particularly scarce. It was a time of paper credit. The country had been deluged with government bills; the famous Land Bank had been established; there had been a rage for speculating; the people had run mad with schemes for new settlements; for building cities in the wilderness; land jobbers went about with maps of grants, and townships, and Eldorados, lying nobody knew where, but which every body was ready to purchase. In a word, the great speculating fever which breaks out every now and then in the country, had raged to an alarming degree, and every body was dreaming of making sudden fortunes from nothing. As usual the fever had subsided; the dream had gone off, and the imaginary fortunes with it; the patients were left in doleful plight, and the whole country resounded with the consequent cry of “hard times.” At this propitious time of public distress did Tom Walker set up as a usurer in Boston. His door was soon thronged by customers. The needy and the adventurous; the gambling speculator; the dreaming land jobber; the thriftless tradesman; the merchant with cracked credit; in short, every one driven to raise money by desperate means and desperate sacrifices, hurried to Tom Walker.

Thus Tom was the universal friend of the needy, and he acted like a “friend in need;” that is to say, he always exacted good pay and good security. In proportion to the distress of the applicant was the hardness of his terms. He accumulated bonds and mortgages; gradually squeezed his customers closer and closer; and sent them at length, dry as a sponge from his door.

In this way he made money hand over hand; became a rich and mighty man, and exalted his cocked hat upon change. He built himself, as usual, a vast house, out of ostentation; but left the greater part of it unfinished and unfurnished out of parsimony. He even set up a carriage in the fullness of his vain glory, though he nearly starved the horses which drew it; and as the ungreased wheels groaned and screeched on the axle trees, you would have thought you heard the souls of the poor debtors he was squeezing.

As Tom waxed old, however, he grew thoughtful. Having secured the good things of this world, he began to feel anxious about those of the next. He thought with regret on the bargain he had made with his black friend, and set his wits to work to cheat him out of the conditions. He became, therefore, all of a sudden, a violent church goer. He prayed loudly and strenuously as if heaven were to be taken by force of lungs. Indeed, one might always tell when he had sinned most during the week, by the clamor of his Sunday devotion. The quiet Christians who had been modestly and steadfastly travelling Zionward, were struck with self reproach at seeing themselves so suddenly outstripped in their career by this new made convert. Tom was as rigid in religious, as in money matters; he was a stern supervisor and censurer of his neighbors, and seemed to think every sin entered up to their account became a credit on his own side of the page. He even talked of the expediency of reviving the persecution of quakers and anabaptists. In a word, Tom's zeal became as notorious as his riches.

Still, in spite of all this strenuous attention to forms, Tom had a lurking dread that the devil, after all, would have his due. That he might not be taken unawares, therefore, it is said he always carried a small bible in his coat pocket. He had also a great folio bible on his counting house desk, and would frequently be found reading it when people called on business; on such occasions he would lay his green spectacles in the book, to mark the place, while he turned round to drive some usurious bargain.

Some say that Tom grew a little crack brained in his old days, and that fancying his end approaching, he had his horse new shod, saddled and bridled, and buried with his feet uppermost; because he supposed that at the last day the world would be turned upside down; in which case he should find his horse standing ready for mounting, and he was determined at the worst to give his old friend a run for it. This, however, is probably a mere old wives' fable. If he really did take such a precaution it was totally superfluous; at least so says the authentic old legend which closes his story in the following manner.

One hot afternoon in the dog days, just as a terrible black thundergust was coming up, Tom sat in his counting house in his white linen cap and India silk morning gown. He was on the point of foreclosing a mortgage, by which he would complete the ruin of an unlucky land speculator for whom he had professed the greatest friendship. The poor land jobber begged him to grant a few months' indulgence. Tom had grown testy and irritated and refused another day.

“My family will be ruined and brought upon the parish,” said the land jobber. “Charity begins at home,” replied Tom, “I must take care of myself in these hard times.”

“You have made so much money out of me,” said the speculator.

Tom lost his patience and his piety—“The devil take me,” said he, “if I have made a farthing!”

Just then there were three loud knocks at the street door. He stepped out to see who was there. A black man was holding a black horse which neighed and stamped with impatience.

“Tom, you're come for!” said the black fellow, gruffly. Tom shrunk back, but too late. He had left his little bible at the bottom of his coat pocket, and his big bible on the desk buried under the mortgage he was about to foreclose: never was sinner taken more unawares. The black man whisked him like a child into the saddle, gave the horse a lash, and away he galloped, with Tom on his back, in the midst of a thunder storm. The clerks stuck their pens behind their ears and stared after him from the windows. Away went Tom Walker, dashing down the street; his white cap bobbing up and down; his morning gown fluttering in the wind, and his steed striking fire out of the pavement at every bound. When the clerks turned to look for the black man he had disappeared.

Tom Walker never returned to foreclose the mortgage. A countryman who lived on the borders of the swamp, reported that in the height of the thunder gust he had heard a great clattering of hoofs and a howling along the road, and running to the window caught sight of a figure, such as I have described, on a horse that galloped like mad across the fields, over the hills and down into the black hemlock swamp towards the old Indian fort; and that shortly after a thunderbolt falling in that direction seemed to set the whole forest in a blaze.

The good people of Boston shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders, but had been so much accustomed to witches and goblins and tricks of the devil in all kinds of shapes from the first settlement of the colony, that they were not so much horror struck as might have been expected. Trustees were appointed to take charge of Tom's effects. There was nothing, however, to administer upon. On searching his coffers all his bonds and mortgages were found reduced to cinders. In place of gold and silver his iron chest was filled with chips and shavings; two skeletons lay in his stable instead of his half starved horses, and the very next day his great house took fire and was burnt to the ground.

Such was the end of Tom Walker and his ill-gotten wealth. Let all griping money brokers lay this story to heart. The truth of it is not to be doubted. The very hole under the oak trees, whence he dug Kidd's money, is to be seen to this day; and the neighboring swamp and old Indian fort are often haunted in stormy nights by a figure on horseback, in a morning gown and white cap, which is doubtless the troubled spirit of the usurer. In fact, the story has resolved itself into a proverb, and is the origin of that popular saying, prevalent throughout New England, of “The Devil and Tom Walker.”

Such, as nearly as I can recollect, was the purport of the tale told by the Cape Cod whaler. There were divers trivial particulars which I have omitted, and which whiled away the morning very pleasantly, until the time of tide favorable for fishing being passed, it was proposed to land, and refresh ourselves under the trees, until the noontide heat should have abated.

We accordingly landed on a delectable part of the island of Mannahatta, in that shady and embowered tract formerly under dominion of the ancient family of the Hardenbrooks. It was a spot well known to me in the course of the aquatic expeditions of my boyhood. Not far from where we landed, was an old Dutch family vault, constructed in the side of a bank, which had been an object of great awe and fable among my school boy associates. We had peeped into it during one of our coasting voyages, and been startled by the sight of mouldering coffins and musty borres within; but what had given it the most fearful interest in our eyes, was its being in some away connected with the pirate wreck which lay rotting among the rocks of Hell Gate. There were also stories of smuggling connected with it, particularly relating to a time when this retired spot was owned by a noted burgher called Ready Money Prevost; a man of whom it was whispered that he had many and mysterious dealings with parts beyond seas. All these things, however, had been jumbled together in our minds in that vague way in which such themes are mingled up in the tales of boyhood.

While I was pondering upon these matters my companions had spread a repast, from the contents of our well stored pannier, under a broad chesnut, on the green sward which swept down to the water's edge. Here we solaced ourselves on the cool grassy carpet during the warm sunny hours of midday. While lolling on the grass indulging in that kind of musing reverie of which I am fond, I summoned up the dusky recollections of my boyhood respecting this place, and repeated them like the imperfectly remembered traces of a dream, for the amusement of my companions. When I had finished a worthy old burgher, John Josse Vandermoere, the same who once related to me the adventures of Dolph Heyliger, broke silence and observed, that he recollected a story of money digging which occurred in this very neighborhood. and might account for some of the readitions which I had heard in my boyhood. As we knew him to be one of the most authentic narrators in the province we begged him to let us have the particulars, and accordingly, while we solaced ourselves with a clean long pipe of Blase Moore's best tobacco, the authentic John Josse Vandermoere related the following tale.





Legend of the Arabian Astrologer


In old times, many hundred years ago, there was a Moorish king named Aben Habuz, who reigned over the kingdom of Granada. He was a retired conqueror, that is to say, one who, having in his more youthful days led a life of constant foray and depredation, now that he was grown feeble and superannuated, “languished for repose,” and desired nothing more than to live at peace with all the world, to husband his laurels, and to enjoy in quiet the possessions he had wrested from his neighbors.

It so happened, however, that this most reasonable and pacific old monarch had young rivals to deal with; princes full of his early passion for fame and fighting, and who were disposed to call him to account for the scores he had run up with their fathers. Certain distant districts of his own territories, also, which during the days of his vigor he had treated with a high hand, were prone, now that he languished for repose, to rise in rebellion and threaten to invest him in his capital. Thus he had foes on every side; and as Granada is surrounded by wild and craggy mountains, which hide the approach of an enemy, the unfortunate Aben Habuz was kept in a constant state of vigilance and alarm, not knowing in what quarter hostilities might break out.

It was in vain that he built watchtowers on the mountains, and stationed guards at every pass with orders to make fires by night and smoke by day, on the approach of an enemy. His alert foes, baffling every precaution, would break out of some unthought-of defile, ravage his lands beneath his very nose, and then make off with prisoners and booty to the mountains. Was ever peaceable and retired conqueror in a more uncomfortable predicament?

While Aben Habuz was harassed by these perplexities and molestations, an ancient Arabian physician arrived at his court. His gray beard descended to his girdle, and he had every mark of extreme age, yet he had travelled almost the whole way from Egypt on foot, with no other aid than a staff, marked with hieroglyphics. His fame had preceded him. His name was Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub, he was said to have lived ever since the days of Mahomet, and to be son of Abu Ayub; the last of the companions of the Prophet. He had, when a child, followed the conquering army of Amru into Egypt, where he had remained many years studying the dark sciences, and particularly magic, among the Egyptian priests.

It was, moreover, said that he had found out the secret of prolonging life, by means of which he had arrived to the great age of upwards of two centuries, though, as he did not discover the secret until well stricken in years, he could only perpetuate his gray hairs and wrinkles.

This wonderful old man was honorably entertained by the king; who, like most superannuated monarchs, began to take physicians into great favor. He would have assigned him an apartment in his palace, but the astrologer preferred a cave in the side of the hill which rises above the city of Granada, being the same on which the Alhambra has since been built. He caused the cave to be enlarged so as to form a spacious and lofty hall, with a circular hole at the top, through which, as through a well, he could see the heavens and behold the stars even at mid-day. The walls of this hall were covered with Egyptian hieroglyphics with cabalistic symbols, and with the figures of the stars in their signs. This hall he furnished with many implements, fabricated under his directions by cunning artificers of Granada, but the occult properties of which were known only to himself.

In a little while the sage Ibrahim became the bosom counsellor of the king, who applied to him for advice in every emergency. Aben Habuz was once inveighing against the injustice of his neighbors, and bewailing the restless vigilance he had to observe to guard himself against their invasions; when he had finished, the astrologer remained silent for a moment, and then replied, “Know, O King, that when I was in Egypt I beheld a great marvel devised by a pagan priestess of old. On a mountain, above the city of Borsa, and overlooking the great valley of the Nile, was a figure of a ram, and above it a figure of a cock, both of molten brass, and turning upon a pivot. Whenever the country was threatened with invasion, the ram would turn in the direction of the enemy, and the cock would crow; upon this the inhabitants of the city knew of the danger, and of the quarter from which it was approaching, and could take timely means to guard against it.”

“God is great!” exclaimed the pacific Aben Habuz, “what a treasure would be such a ram to keep an eye upon these mountains around me; and then such a cock to crow in time of danger! Allah Akbar! how securely I might sleep in my palace with such sentinels on the top!”

The astrologer waited until the ecstasies of the king had subsided, and then proceeded.

“After the victorious Amru (may he rest in peace!) had finished his conquest of Egypt, I remained among the priests of the land, studying the rites and ceremonies of their idolatrous faith, and seeking to make myself master of the hidden knowledge for which they are renowned. I was one day seated on the banks of the Nile, conversing with an ancient priest, when he pointed to the mighty pyramids which rose like mountains out of the neighboring desert. ‘All that we can teach thee,’ said he, ‘is nothing to the knowledge locked up in those mighty piles. In the centre of the central pyramid is a sepulchral chamber, in which is inclosed the mummy of the high-priest, who aided in rearing that stupendous pile; and with him is buried a wondrous book of knowledge containing all the secrets of magic and art. This book was given to Adam after his fall, and was handed down from generation to generation to King Solomon the wise, and by its aid he built the temple of Jerusalem. How it came into the possession of the builder of the pyramids, is known to him alone who knows all things.’

“When I heard these words of the Egyptian priest, my heart burned to get possession of that book. I could command the services of many of the soldiers of our conquering army, and of a number of the native Egyptians: with these I set to work, and pierced the solid mass of the pyramid, until, after great toil, I came upon one of its interior and hidden passages. Following this up, and threading a fearful labyrinth, I penetrated into the very heart of the pyramid, even to the sepulchral chamber, where the mummy of the high-priest had lain for ages. I broke through the outer cases of the mummy, unfolded its many wrappers and bandages, and at length found the precious volume on its bosom. I seized it with a trembling hand, and groped my way out of the pyramid, leaving the mummy in its dark and silent sepulchre, there to await the final day of resurrection and judgment.”

“Son of Abu Ayub,” exclaimed Aben Habuz, “thou hast been a great traveller, and seen marvellous things; but of what avail to me is the secret of the pyramid, and the volume of knowledge of the wise Solomon?”

“This it is, O king! By the study of that book I am instructed in all magic arts, and can command the assistance of genii to accomplish my plans. The mystery of the Talisman of Borsa is therefore familiar to me, and such a talisman can I make; nay, one of greater virtues.”

“O wise son of Abu Ayub,” cried Aben Habuz, “better were such a talisman, than all the watch towers on the hills, and sentinels upon the borders. Give me such a safeguard, and the riches of my treasury are at thy command.”

The astrologer immediately set to work to gratify the wishes of the monarch. He caused a great tower to be erected upon the top of the royal palace, which stood on the brow of the hill of the Albaycin. The tower was built of stones brought from Egypt, and taken, it is said, from one of the pyramids. In the upper part of the tower was a circular hall, with windows looking towards every point of the compass, and before each window was a table, on which was arranged, as on a chess-board, a mimic army of horse and foot, with the effigy of the potentate that ruled in that direction, all carved of wood. To each of these tables there was a small lance, no bigger than a bodkin, on which were engraved certain Chaldaic characters. This hall was kept constantly closed, by a gate of brass, with a great lock of steel, the key of which was in possession of the king.

On the top of the tower was a bronze figure of a Moorish horseman, fixed on a pivot, with a shield on one arm, and his lance elevated perpendicularly. The face of this horseman was towards the city, as if keeping guard over it; but if any foe were at hand, the figure would turn in that direction, and would level the lance as if for action.

When this talisman was finished, Aben Habuz was all impatient to try its virtues; and longed as ardently for an invasion as he had ever sighed after repose. His desire was soon gratified. Tidings were brought, early one morning, by the sentinel appointed to watch the tower, that the face of the bronze horseman was turned towards the mountains of Elvira, and that his lance pointed directly against the Pass of Lope.

“Let the drums and trumpets sound to arms, and all Granada be put on the alert,” said Aben Habuz.

“O king,” said the astrologer, “let not your city be disquieted, nor your warriors called to arms; we need no aid of force to deliver you from your enemies. Dismiss your attendants, and let us proceed alone to the secret hall of the tower.”

The ancient Aben Habuz mounted the staircase of the tower, leaning on the arm of the still more ancient Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub. They unlocked the brazen door and entered. The window that looked towards the Pass of Lope was open. “In this direction,” said the astrologer, “lies the danger; approach, O king, and behold the mystery of the table.”

King Aben Habuz approached the seeming chess-board, on which were arranged the small wooden effigies, when, to his surprise, he perceived that they were all in motion. The horses pranced and curveted, the warriors brandished their weapons, and there was a faint sound of drums and trumpets, and the clang of arms, and neighing of steeds; but all no louder, nor more distinct, than the hum of the bee, or the summer-fly, in the drowsy ear of him who lies at noontide in the shade.

“Behold, O king,” said the astrologer, “a proof that thy enemies are even now in the field. They must be advancing through yonder mountains, by the Pass of Lope. Would you produce a panic and confusion amongst them, and cause them to retreat without loss of life, strike these effigies with the but-end of this magic lance; would you cause bloody feud and carnage, strike with the point.”

A livid streak passed across the countenance of Aben Habuz; he seized the lance with trembling eagerness; his gray beard wagged with exultation as he tottered toward the table: “Son of Abu Ayub,” exclaimed he, in chuckling tone, “I think we will have a little blood!”

So saying, he thrust the magic lance into some of the pigmy effigies, and belabored others with the but-end, upon which the former fell as dead upon the board, and the rest turning upon each other began, pell-mell, a chance-medley fight.

It was with difficulty the astrologer could stay the hand of the most pacific of monarchs, and prevent him from absolutely exterminating his foes; at length he prevailed upon him to leave the tower, and to send out scouts to the mountains by the Pass of Lope.

They returned with the intelligence, that a Christian army had advanced through the heart of the Sierra, almost within sight of Granada, where a dissension had broken out among them; they had turned their weapons against each other, and after much slaughter had retreated over the border.

Aben Hazuz was transported with joy on thus proving the efficacy of the talisman. “At length,” said he, “I shall lead a life of tranquillity, and have all my enemies in my power. O wise son of Abu Ayub, what can I bestow on thee in reward for such a blessing?”

“The wants of an old man and a philosopher, O king, are few and simple; grant me but the means of fitting up my cave as a suitable hermitage, and I am content.”

“How noble is the moderation of the truly wise!” exclaimed Aben Habuz, secretly pleased at the cheapness of the recompense. He summoned his treasurer, and bade him dispense whatever sums might be required by Ibrahim to complete and furnish his hermitage.

The astrologer now gave orders to have various chambers hewn out of the solid rock, so as to form ranges of apartments connected with his astrological hall; these he caused to be furnished with luxurious ottomans and divans, and the walls to be hung with the richest silks of Damascus. “I am an old man,” said he, “and can no longer rest my bones on stone couches, and these damp walls require covering.”

He had baths too constructed, and provided with all kinds of perfumes and aromatic oils:“For a bath,” said he, “is necessary to counteract the rigidity of age, and to restore freshness and suppleness to the frame withered by study.”

He caused the apartments to be hung with innumerable silver and crystal lamps, which he filled with a fragrant oil, prepared according to a receipt discovered by him in the tombs of Egypt. This oil was perpetual in its nature, and diffused a soft radiance like the tempered light of day. “The light of the sun,” said he, “is too garish and violent for the eyes of an old man, and the light of the lamp is more congenial to the studies of a philosopher.”

The treasurer of King Aben Habuz groaned at the sums daily demanded to fit up this hermitage, and he carried his complaints to the king. The royal word, however, had been given; Aben Habuz shrugged his shoulders: “We must have patience,” said he, “this old man has taken his idea of a philosophic retreat from the interior of the pyramids, and of the vast ruins of Egypt; but all things have an end, and so will the furnishing of his cavern.”

The king was in the right; the hermitage was at length complete, and formed a sumptuous subterranean palace. The astrologer expressed himself perfectly content, and, shutting himself up, remained for three whole days buried in study. At the end of that time he appeared again before the treasurer. “One thing more is necessary,” said he, “one trifling solace for the intervals of mental labor.”

“O wise Ibrahim, I am bound to furnish every thing necessary for thy solitude; what more dost thou require?”

“I would fain have a few dancing women.”

“Dancing women!” echoed the treasurer, with surprise.

“Dancing women,” replied the sage, gravely; “and let them be young and fair to look upon; for the sight of youth and beauty is refreshing. A few will suffice, for I am a philosopher of simple habits and easily satisfied.”

While the philosophic Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub passed his time thus sagely in his hermitage, the pacific Aben Habuz carried on furious campaigns in effigy in his tower. It was a glorious thing for an old man, like himself, of quiet habits, to have war made easy, and to be enabled to amuse himself in his chamber by brushing away whole armies like so many swarms of flies.

For a time he rioted in the indulgence of his humors, and even taunted and insulted his neighbors, to induce them to make incursions; but by degrees they grew wary from repeated disasters, until no one ventured to invade his territories. For many months the bronze horseman remained on the peace establishment, with his lance elevated in the air, and the worthy old monarch began to repine at the want of his accustomed sport, and to grow peevish at his monotonous tranquillity.

At length, one day, the talismanic horseman veered suddenly round, and lowering his lance, made a dead point towards the mountains of Guadix. Aben Habuz hastened to his tower, but the magic table in that direction remained quiet; not a single warrior was in motion. Perplexed at the circumstance, he sent forth a troop of horse to scour the mountains and reconnoitre. They returned after three days' absence.

“We have searched every mountain pass,” they said, “but not a helm nor spear was stirring. All that we have found in the course of our foray, was a Christian damsel of surpassing beauty, sleeping at noontide beside a fountain, whom we have brought away captive.”

“A damsel of surpassing beauty!” exclaimed Aben Habuz, his eyes gleaming with animation; “let her be conducted into my presence.”

The beautiful damsel was accordingly conducted into his presence. She was arrayed with all the luxury of ornament that had prevailed among the Gothic Spaniards at the time of the Arabian conquest. Pearls of dazzling whiteness were entwined with her raven tresses; and jewels sparkled on her forehead, rivalling the lustre of her eyes. Around her neck was a golden chain, to which was suspended a silver lyre, which hung by her side.

The flashes of her dark refulgent eye were like sparks of fire on the withered, yet combustible, heart of Aben Habuz; the swimming voluptuousness of her gait made his senses reel. “Fairest of women,” cried he, with rapture, “who and what art thou?”

“The daughter of one of the Gothic princes, who but lately ruled over this land. The armies of my father have been destroyed, as if by magic, among these mountains; he has been driven into exile, and his daughter is a captive.”

“Beware, O king!” whispered Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub, “this may be one of those northern sorceresses of whom we have heard, who assume the most seductive forms to beguile the unwary. Methinks I read witchcraft in her eye, and sorcery in every movement. Doubtless this is the enemy pointed out by the talisman.”

“Son of Abu Ayub,” replied the king, “thou art a wise man, I grant, a conjuror for aught I know; but thou art little versed in the ways of woman. In that knowledge will I yield to no man; no, not to the wise Solomon himself, notwithstanding the number of his wives and concubines. As to this damsel, I see no harm in her; she is fair to look upon, and finds favor in my eyes.”

“Hearken, O king!” replied the astrologer. “I have given thee many victories by means of my talisman, but have never shared any of the spoil. Give me then this stray captive, to solace me in my solitude with her silver lyre. If she be indeed a sorceress, I have counter spells that set her charms at defiance.”

“What! more women!” cried Aben Habuz. “Hast thou not already dancing women enough to solace thee?”

“Dancing women have I, it is true, but no singing women. I would fain have a little minstrelsy to refresh my mind when weary with the toils of study.”

“A truce with thy hermit cravings,” said the king, impatiently. “This damsel have I marked for my own. I see much comfort in her; even such comfort as David, the father of Solomon the wise, found in the society of Abishag the Shunamite.”

Further solicitations and remonstrances of the astrologer only provoked a more peremptory reply from the monarch, and they parted in high displeasure. The sage shut himself up in his hermitage to brood over his disappointment; ere he departed, however, he gave the king one more warning to beware of his dangerous captive. But where is the old man in love that will listen to council? Aben Habuz resigned himself to the full sway of his passion. His only study was how to render himself amiable in the eyes of the Gothic beauty. He had not youth to recommend him, it is true, but then he had riches; and when a lover is old, he is generally generous. The Zacatin of Granada was ransacked for the most precious merchandise of the East; silks, jewels, precious gems, exquisite perfumes, all that Asia and Africa yielded of rich and rare, were lavished upon the princess. All kinds of spectacles and festivities were devised for her entertainment; minstrelsy, dancing, tournaments, bull-fights;—Granada for a time was a scene of perpetual pageant. The Gothic princess regarded all this splendor with the air of one accustomed to magnificence. She received every thing as a homage due to her rank, or rather to her beauty; for beauty is more lofty in its exactions even than rank. Nay, she seemed to take a secret pleasure in exciting the monarch to expenses that made his treasury shrink; and then treating his extravagant generosity as a mere matter of course. With all his assiduity and munificence, also, the venerable lover could not flatter himself that he had made any impression on her heart. She never frowned on him, it is true, but then she never smiled. Whenever he began to plead his passion, she struck her silver lyre. There was a mystic charm in the sound. In an instant the monarch began to nod; a drowsiness stole over him, and he gradually sank into a sleep, from which he awoke wonderfully refreshed, but perfectly cooled for the time of his passion. This was very baffling to his suit; but then these slumbers were accompanied by agreeable dreams, which completely enthralled the senses of the drowsy lover; so he continued to dream on, while all Granada scoffed at his infatuation, and groaned at the treasures lavished for a song.

At length a danger burst on the head of Aben Habuz, against which his talisman yielded him no warning. An insurrection broke out in his very capital: his palace was surrounded by an armed rabble, who menaced his life and the life of his Christian paramour. A spark of his ancient warlike spirit was awakened in the breast of the monarch. At the head of a handful of his guards he sallied forth, put the rebels to flight, and crushed the insurrection in the bud.

When quiet was again restored, he sought the astrologer, who still remained shut up in his hermitage, chewing the bitter cud of resentment.

Aben Habuz approached him with a conciliatory tone. “O wise son of Abu Ayub,” said he, “well didst thou predict dangers to me from this captive beauty: tell me then, thou who art so quick at foreseeing peril, what I should do to avert it.”

“Put from thee the infidel damsel who is the cause.”

“Sooner would I part with my kingdom,” cried Aben Habuz.

“Thou art in danger of losing both,” replied the astrologer.

“Be not harsh and angry, O most profound of philosophers; consider the double distress of a monarch and a lover, and devise some means of protecting me from the evils by which I am menaced. I care not for grandeur, I care not for power, I languish only for repose; would that I had some quiet retreat where I might take refuge from the world, and all its cares, and pomps, and troubles, and devote the remainder of my days to tranquillity and love.”

The astrologer regarded him for a moment, from under his bushy eyebrows.

“And what wouldst thou give, if I could provide thee such a retreat?”

“Thou shouldst name thy own reward, and whatever it might be, if within the scope of my power, as my soul liveth, it should be thine.”

“Thou hast heard, O king, of the garden of Irem, one of the prodigies of Arabia the happy?”

“I have heard of that garden; it is recorded in the Koran, even in the chapter entitled ‘The Dawn of Day.’ I have, moreover, heard marvellous things related of it by pilgrims who had been to Mecca; but I considered them wild fables, such as travellers are wont to tell who have visited remote countries.”

“Discredit not, O king, the tales of travellers,” rejoined the astrologer, gravely, “for they contain precious rarities of knowledge brought from the ends of the earth. As to the palace and garden of Irem, what is generally told of them is true; I have seen them with mine own eyes—listen to my adventure; for it has a bearing upon the object of your request.

“In my younger days, when a mere Arab of the desert, I tended my father's camels. In traversing the desert of Aden, one of them strayed from the rest, and was lost. I searched after it for several days, but in vain, until, wearied and faint, I laid myself down at noontide, and slept under a palm-tree by the side of a scanty well. When I awoke, I found myself at the gate of a city. I entered, and beheld noble streets, and squares, and market-places; but all were silent and without an inhabitant. I wandered on until I came to a sumptuous palace with a garden adorned with fountains and fishponds, and groves and flowers, and orchards laden with delicious fruit; but still no one was to be seen. Upon which, appalled at this loneliness, I hastened to depart; and, after issuing forth at the gate of the city, I turned to look upon the place, but it was no longer to be seen; nothing but the silent desert extended before my eyes.

“In the neighborhood I met with an aged dervise, learned in the traditions and secrets of the land, and related to him what had befallen me. ‘This,’ said he, ‘is the far-famed garden of Irem, one of the wonders of the desert. It only appears at times to some wanderer like thyself, gladdening him with the sight of towers and palaces and garden walls overhung with richly-laden fruit-trees, and then vanishes, leaving nothing but a lonely desert. And this is the story of it. In old times, when this country was inhabited by the Addites, King Sheddad, the son of Ad, the great grandson of Noah, founded here a splendid city. When it was finished, and he saw its grandeur, his heart was puffed up with pride and arrogance, and he determined to build a royal palace, with gardens which should rival all related in the Koran of the celestial paradise. But the curse of heaven fell upon him for his presumption. He and his subjects were swept from the earth, and his splendid city, and palace, and gardens, were laid under a perpetual spell, which hides them from human sight, excepting that they are seen at intervals, by way of keeping his sin in perpetual remembrance.’

“This story, O king, and the wonders I had seen, ever dwelt in my mind; and in after years, when I had been in Egypt, and was possessed of the book of knowledge of Solomon the wise, I determined to return and revisit the garden of Irem. I did so, and found it revealed to my instructed sight. I took possession of the palace of Sheddad, and passed several days in his mock paradise. The genii who watch over the place, were obedient to my magic power, and revealed to me the spells by which the whole garden had been, as it were, conjured into existence, and by which it was rendered invisible. Such a palace and garden, O king, can I make for thee, even here, on the mountain above thy city. Do I not know all the secret spells? and am I not in possession of the book of knowledge of Solomon the wise?”

“O wise son of Abu Ayub!” exclaimed Aben Habuz, trembling with eagerness, “thou art a traveller indeed, and hast seen and learned marvellous things! Contrive me such a paradise, and ask any reward, even to the half of my kingdom.”

“Alas!” replied the other, “thou knowest I am an old man, and a philosopher, and easily satisfied; all the reward I ask is the first beast of burden, with its load, which shall enter the magic portal of the palace.”

The monarch gladly agreed to so moderate a stipulation, and the astrologer began his work. On the summit of the hill, immediately above his subterranean hermitage, he caused a great gateway or barbican to be erected, opening through the centre of a strong tower.

There was an outer vestibule or porch, with a lofty arch, and within it a portal secured by massive gates. On the keystone of the portal the astrologer, with his own hand, wrought the figure of a huge key; and on the key-stone of the outer arch of the vestibule, which was loftier than that of the portal, he carved a gigantic hand. These were potent talismans, over which he repeated many sentences in an unknown tongue.

When this gateway was finished he shut himself up for two days in his astrological hall, engaged in secret incantations; on the third he ascended the hill, and passed the whole day on its summit. At a late hour of the night he came down, and presented himself before Aben Habuz. “At length, O king,” said he, “my labor is accomplished. On the summit of the hill stands one of the most delectable palaces that ever the head of man devised, or the heart of man desired. It contains sumptuous halls and galleries, delicious gardens, cool fountains, and fragrant baths; in a word, the whole mountain is converted into a paradise. Like the garden of Irem, it is protected by a mighty charm, which hides it from the view and search of mortals, excepting such as possess the secret of its talismans.”

“Enough!” cried Aben Habuz, joyfully, “to-morrow morning with the first light we will ascend and take possession.” The happy monarch slept but little that night. Scarcely had the rays of the sun begun to play about the snowy summit of the Sierra Nevada, when he mounted his steed, and, accompanied only by a few chosen attendants, ascended a steep and narrow road leading up the hill. Beside him, on a white palfrey, rode the Gothic princess, her whole dress sparkling with jewels, while round her neck was suspended her silver lyre. The astrologer walked on the other side of the king, assisting his steps with his hieroglyphic staff, for he never mounted steed of any kind.

Aben Habuz looked to see the towers of the palace brightening above him, and the imbowered terraces of its gardens stretching along the heights; but as yet nothing of the kind was to be descried. “That is the mystery and safeguard of the place,” said the astrologer, “nothing can be discerned until you have passed the spell-bound gateway, and been put in possession of the place.”

As they approached the gateway, the astrologer paused, and pointed out to the king the mystic hand and key carved upon the portal and the arch. “These,” said he, “are the talismans which guard the entrance to this paradise. Until yonder hand shall reach down and seize that key, neither mortal power nor magic artifice can prevail against the lord of this mountain.”

While Aben Habuz was gazing, with open mouth and silent wonder, at these mystic talismans, the palfrey of the princess proceeded, and bore her in at the portal, to the very centre of the barbican.

“Behold,” cried the astrologer, “my promised reward; the first animal with its burden which should enter the magic gateway.”

Aben Habuz smiled at what he considered a pleasantry of the ancient man; but when he found him to be in earnest, his grey beard trembled with indignation.

“Son of Abu Ayub,” said he, sternly, “what equivocation is this? Thou knowest the meaning of my promise: the first beast of burden, with its load, that should enter this portal. Take the strongest mule in my stables, load it with the most precious things of my treasury, and it is thine; but dare not raise thy thoughts to her who is the delight of my heart.”

“What need I of wealth?” cried the astrologer, scornfully; “have I not the book of knowledge of Solomon the wise, and through it the command of the secret treasures of the earth? The princess is mine by right; thy royal word is pledged; I claim her as my own.”

The princess looked down haughtily from her palfrey, and a light smile of scorn curled her rosy lip at this dispute between two gray-beards, for the possession of youth and beauty. The wrath of the monarch got the better of his discretion. “Base son of the desert,” cried he, “thou may'st be master of many arts, but know me for thy master, and presume not to juggle with thy king.”

“My master! my king!” echoed the astrologer,—“the monarch of a mole-hill to claim sway over him who possesses the talismans of Solomon! Farewell, Aben Habuz; reign over thy petty kingdom, and revel in thy paradise of fools, for me, I will laugh at thee in my philosophic retirement.”

So saying he seized the bridle of the palfrey, smote the earth with his staff, and sank with the Gothic princess through the centre of the barbican. The earth closed over them, and no trace remained of the opening by which they had descended.

Aben Habuz was struck dumb for a time with astonishment. Recovering himself, he ordered a thousand workmen to dig, with pickaxe and spade, into the ground where the astrologer had disappeared. They digged and digged, but in vain; the flinty bosom of the hill resisted their implements; or if they did penetrate a little way, the earth filled in again as fast as they threw it out. Aben Habuz sought the mouth of the cavern at the foot of the hill, leading to the subterranean palace of the astrologer; but it was nowhere to be found. Where once had been an entrance, was now a solid surface of primeval rock. With the disappearance of Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub ceased the benefit of his talismans. The bronze horseman remained fixed, with his face turned toward the hill, and his spear pointed to the spot where the astrologer had descended, as if there still lurked the deadliest foe of Aben Habuz.

From time to time the sound of music, and the tones of a female voice, could be faintly heard from the bosom of the hill; and a peasant one day brought word to the king, that in the preceding night he had found a fissure in the rock, by which he had crept in, until he looked down into a subterranean hall, in which sat the astrologer, on a magnificent divan, slumbering and nodding to the silver lyre of the princess, which seemed to hold a magic sway over his senses.

Aben Habuz sought the fissure in the rock, but it was again closed. He renewed the attempt to unearth his rival, but all in vain. The spell of the hand and key was too potent to be counteracted by human power. As to the summit of the mountain, the site of the promised palace and garden, it remained a naked waste; either the boasted elysium was hidden from sight by enchantment, or was a mere fable of the astrologer. The world charitably supposed the latter, and some used to call the place “The King's Folly;” while others named it “The Fool's Paradise.”

To add to the chagrin of Aben Habuz, the neighbors whom he had defied and taunted, and cut up at his leisure while master of the talismanic horseman, finding him no longer protected by magic spell, made inroads into his territories from all sides, and the remainder of the life of the most pacific of monarchs was a tissue of turmoils.

At length Aben Habuz died, and was buried. Ages have since rolled away. The Alhambra has been built on the eventful mountain, and in some measure realizes the fabled delights of the garden of Irem. The spell-bound gateway still exists entire, protected no doubt by the mystic hand and key, and now forms the Gate of Justice, the grand entrance to the fortress. Under that gateway, it is said, the old astrologer remains in his subterranean hall, nodding on his divan, lulled by the silver lyre of the princess.

The old invalid sentinels who mount guard at the gate hear the strains occasionally in the summer nights; and, yielding to their soporific power, doze quietly at their posts. Nay, so drowsy an influence pervades the place, that even those who watch by day may generally be seen nodding on the stone benches of the barbican, or sleeping under the neighboring trees; so that in fact it is the drowsiest military post in all Christendom. All this, say the ancient legends, will endure from age to age. The princess will remain captive to the astrologer; and the astrologer, bound up in magic slumber by the princess, until the last day, unless the mystic hand shall grasp the fated key, and dispel the whole charm of this enchanted mountain.





Note to the Arabian Astrologer


Al Makkari, in his history of the Mahommedan Dynasties in Spain, cites from another Arabian writer an account of a talismanic effigy somewhat similar to the one in the foregoing legend.

In Cadiz, says he, there formerly stood a square tower upwards of one hundred cubits high, built of huge blocks of stone, fastened together with clamps of brass. On the top was the figure of a man, holding a staff in his right hand, his face turned to the Atlantic, and pointing with the forefinger of his left hand to the Straits of Gibraltar. It was said to have been set up in ancient times by the Gothic kings of Andalus, as a beacon or guide to navigators. The Moslems of Barbary and Andalus, considered it a talisman which exercised a spell over the seas. Under its guidance, swarms of piratical people of a nation called Majus, appeared on the coast in large vessels with a square sail in the bow, and another in the stern. They came every six or seven years; captured every thing they met with on the sea; guided by the statue, they passed through the Straits into the Mediterranean, landed on the coasts of Andalus, laid every thing waste with fire and sword; and sometimes carried their depredations on the opposite coasts even as far as Syria.

At length it came to pass in the time of the civil wars, a Moslem Admiral who had taken possession of Cadiz, hearing that the statue on top of the tower was of pure gold, had it lowered to the ground and broken to pieces: when it proved to be of gilded brass. With the destruction of the idol, the spell over the sea was at an end. From that time forward, nothing more was seen of the piratical people of the ocean, excepting that two of their barks were wrecked on the coast, one at Marsu-l-Majus (the port of the Majus), the other close to the promontory of Al-Aghan.

The maritime invaders above mentioned by Al Makkari must have been the Northmen.





Legend of the Moor's Legacy


Just within the fortress of the Alhambra, in front of the royal palace, is a broad open esplanade, called the Place or Square of the Cisterns, (la Plaza de los Algibes,) so called from being undermined by reservoirs of water, hidden from sight, and which have existed from the time of the Moors. At one corner of this esplanade is a Moorish well, cut through the living rock to a great depth, the water of which is cold as ice and clear as crystal. The wells made by the Moors are always in repute, for it is well known what pains they took to penetrate to the purest and sweetest springs and fountains. The one of which we now speak is famous throughout Granada, insomuch that water-carriers, some bearing great water-jars on their shoulders, others driving asses before them laden with earthen vessels, are ascending and descending the steep woody avenues of the Alhambra, from early dawn until a late hour of the night.

Fountains and wells, ever since the scriptural days, have been noted gossiping places in hot climates; and at the well in question there is a kind of perpetual club kept up during the livelong day, by the invalids, old women, and other curious do nothing folk of the fortress, who sit here on the stone benches, under an awning spread over the well to shelter the toll-gatherer from the sun, and dawdle over the gossip of the fortress, and question every water-carrier that arrives about the news of the city, and make long comments on every thing they hear and see. Not an hour of the day but loitering housewives and idle maid-servants may be seen, lingering, with pitcher on head or in hand, to hear the last of the endless tattle of these worthies.

Among the water-carriers who once resorted to this well, there was a sturdy, strong-backed, bandy-legged little fellow, named Pedro Gil, but called Peregil for shortness. Being a water-carrier, he was a Gallego, or native of Gallicia, of course. Nature seems to have formed races of men, as she has of animals, for different kinds of drudgery. In France the shoeblacks are all Savoyards, the porters of hotels all Swiss, and in the days of hoops and hair-powder in England, no man could give the regular swing to a sedan-chair but a bog-trotting Irishman. So in Spain, the carriers of water and bearers of burdens are all sturdy little natives of Gallicia. No man says, “Get me a porter,” but, “Call a Gallego.”

To return from this digression, Peregil the Gallego had begun business with merely a great earthen jar which he carried upon his shoulder; by degrees he rose in the world, and was enabled to purchase an assistant of a correspondent class of animals, being a stout shaggy-haired donkey. On each side of this his long-eared aide-de-camp, in a kind of pannier, were slung his water-jars, covered with fig-leaves to protect them from the sun. There was not a more industrious water-carrier in all Granada, nor one more merry withal. The streets rang with his cheerful voice as he trudged after his donkey, singing forth the usual summer note that resounds through the Spanish towns: “Quien quiere agua—agua mas fria que la nieve?”—“Who wants water—water colder than snow? Who wants water from the well of the Alhambra, cold as ice and clear as crystal?” When he served a customer with a sparkling glass, it was always with a pleasant word that caused a smile; and if, perchance, it was a comely dame or dimpling damsel, it was always with a sly leer and a compliment to her beauty that was irresistible. Thus Peregil the Gallego was noted throughout all Granada for being one of the civilest, pleasantest, and happiest of mortals. Yet it is not he who sings loudest and jokes most that has the lightest heart. Under all this air of merriment, honest Peregil had his cares and troubles. He had a large family of ragged children to support, who were hungry and clamorous as a nest of young swallows, and beset him with their outcries for food whenever he came home of an evening. He had a helpmate, too, who was any thing but a help to him. She had been a village beauty before marriage, noted for her skill at dancing the bolero and rattling the castanets; and she still retained her early propensities, spending the hard earnings of honest Peregil in frippery, and laying the very donkey under requisition for junketing parties into the country on Sundays, and saints' days, and those innumerable holidays which are rather more numerous in Spain than the days of the week. With all this she was a little of a slattern, something more of a lie-abed, and, above all, a gossip of the first water; neglecting house, household, and every thing else, to loiter slipshod in the houses of her gossip neighbors.

He, however, who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, accommodates the yoke of matrimony to the submissive neck. Peregil bore all the heavy dispensations of wife and children with as meek a spirit as his donkey bore the water-jars; and, however he might shake his ears in private, never ventured to question the household virtues of his slattern spouse.

He loved his children too even as an owl loves its owlets, seeing in them his own image multiplied and perpetuated; for they were a sturdy, long-backed, bandy-legged little brood. The great pleasure of honest Peregil was, whenever he could afford himself a scanty holiday, and had a handful of marevedis to spare, to take the whole litter forth with him, some in his arms, some tugging at his skirts, and some trudging at his heels, and to treat them to a gambol among the orchards of the Vega, while his wife was dancing with her holiday friends in the Angosturas of the Darro.

It was a late hour one summer night, and most of the water-carriers had desisted from their toils. The day had been uncommonly sultry; the night was one of those delicious moonlights, which tempt the inhabitants of southern climes to indemnify themselves for the heat and inaction of the day, by lingering in the open air, and enjoying its tempered sweetness until after midnight. Customers for water were therefore still abroad. Peregil, like a considerate, painstaking father, thought of his hungry children. “One more journey to the well,” said he to himself, “to earn a Sunday's puchero for the little ones.” So saying, he trudged manfully up the steep avenue of the Alhambra, singing as he went, and now and then bestowing a hearty thwack with a cudgel on the flanks of his donkey, either by way of cadence to the song, or refreshment to the animal; for dry blows serve in lieu of provender in Spain for all beasts of burden.

When arrived at the well, he found it deserted by every one except a solitary stranger in Moorish garb, seated on a stone bench in the moonlight. Peregil paused at first and regarded him with surprise, not unmixed with awe, but the Moor feebly beckoned him to approach. “I am faint and ill,” said he, “aid me to return to the city, and I will pay thee double what thou couldst gain by thy jars of water.”

The honest heart of the little water-carrier was touched with compassion at the appeal of the stranger. “God forbid,” said he, “that I should ask fee or reward for doing a common act of humanity.” He accordingly helped the Moor on his donkey, and set off slowly for Granada, the poor Moslem being so weak that it was necessary to hold him on the animal to keep him from falling to the earth.

When they entered the city, the water-carrier demanded whither he should conduct him. “Alas!” said the Moor, faintly, “I have neither home nor habitation, I am a stranger in the land. Suffer me to lay my head this night beneath thy roof, and thou shalt be amply repaid.”

Honest Peregil thus saw himself unexpectedly saddled with an infidel guest, but he was too humane to refuse a night's shelter to a fellow being in so forlorn a plight, so he conducted the Moor to his dwelling. The children, who had sallied forth open-mouthed as usual on hearing the tramp of the donkey, ran back with affright, when they beheld the turbaned stranger, and hid themselves behind their mother. The latter stepped forth intrepidly, like a ruffling hen before her brood when a vagrant dog approaches.

“What infidel companion,” cried she, “is this you have brought home at this late hour, to draw upon us the eyes of the inquisition?”

“Be quiet, wife,” replied the Gallego, “here is a poor sick stranger, without friend or home; wouldst thou turn him forth to perish in the streets?”

The wife would still have remonstrated, for although she lived in a hovel she was a furious stickler for the credit of her house; the little water-carrier, however, for once was stiffnecked, and refused to bend beneath the yoke. He assisted the poor Moslem to alight, and spread a mat and a sheep-skin for him, on the ground, in the coolest part of the house; being the only kind of bed that his poverty afforded.

In a little while the Moor was seized with violent convulsions, which defied all the ministering skill of the simple water-carrier. The eye of the poor patient acknowledged his kindness. During an interval of his fits he called him to his side, and addressing him in a low voice, “My end,” said he, “I fear is at hand. If I die, I bequeath you this box as a reward for your charity:” so saying, he opened his albornoz, or cloak, and showed a small box of sandal-wood, strapped round his body. “God grant, my friend,” replied the worthy little Gallego, “that you may live many years to enjoy your treasure, whatever it may be.” The Moor shook his head; he laid his hand upon the box, and would have said something more concerning it, but his convulsions returned with increasing violence, and in a little while he expired.

The water-carrier's wife was now as one distracted. “This comes,” said she, “of your foolish good nature, always running into scapes to oblige others. What will become of us when this corpse is found in our house? We shall be sent to prison as murderers; and if we escape with our lives, shall be ruined by notaries and alguazils.”

Poor Peregil was in equal tribulation, and almost repented himself of having done a good deed. At length a thought struck him. “It is not yet day,” said he, “I can convey the dead body out of the city, and bury it in the sands on the banks of the Xenil. No one saw the Moor enter our dwelling, and no one will know any thing of his death.”

So said, so done. The wife aided him; they rolled the body of the unfortunate Moslem in the mat on which he had expired, laid it across the ass, and Peregil set out with it for the banks of the river.

As ill luck would have it, there lived opposite to the water-carrier a barber named Pedrillo Pedrugo, one of the most prying, tattling, and mischief-making of his gossip tribe. He was a weasel-faced, spider-legged varlet, supple and insinuating; the famous barber of Seville could not surpass him for his universal knowledge of the affairs of others, and he had no more power of retention than a sieve. It was said that he slept but with one eye at a time, and kept one ear uncovered, so that, even in his sleep he might see and hear all that was going on. Certain it is, he was a sort of scandalous chronicle for the quid-nuncs of Granada, and had more customers than all the rest of his fraternity.

This meddlesome barber heard Peregil arrive at an unusual hour at night, and the exclamations of his wife and children. His head was instantly popped out of a little window which served him as a look-out, and he saw his neighbor assist a man in Moorish garb into his dwelling. This was so strange an occurrence, that Pedrillo Pedrugo slept not a wink that night. Every five minutes he was at his loophole, watching the lights that gleamed through the chinks of his neighbor's door, and before daylight he beheld Peregil sally forth with his donkey unusually laden.

The inquisitive barber was in a fidget; he slipped on his clothes, and, stealing forth silently, followed the water-carrier at a distance, until he saw him dig a hole in the sandy bank of the Xenil, and bury something that had the appearance of a dead body.

The barber hied him home, and fidgeted about his shop, setting every thing upside down, until sunrise. He then took a basin under his arm, and sallied forth to the house of his daily customer the alcalde.

The alcalde was just risen. Pedrillo Pedrugo seated him in a chair, threw a napkin round his neck, put a basin of hot water under his chin, and began to mollify his beard with his fingers.

“Strange doings!” said Pedrugo, who played barber and newsmonger at the same time—“strange doings! Robbery, and murder, and burial all in one night!”

“Hey!—how!—what is that you say?” cried the alcalde.

“I say,” replied the barber, rubbing a piece of soap over the nose and mouth of the dignitary, for a Spanish barber disdains to employ a brush—“I say that Peregil the Gallego has robbed and murdered a Moorish Mussulman, and buried him, this blessed night. Maldita sea la noche;—accursed be the night for the same!”

“But how do you know all this?” demanded the alcalde.

“Be patient, Señor, and you shall hear all about it,” replied Pedrillo, taking him by the nose and sliding a razor over his cheek. He then recounted all that he had seen, going through both operations at the same time, shaving his beard, washing his chin, and wiping him dry with a dirty napkin, while he was robbing, murdering, and burying the Moslem.

Now it so happened that this alcalde was one of the most overbearing, and at the same time most griping and corrupt curmudgeons in all Granada. It could not be denied, however, that he set a high value upon justice, for he sold it at its weight in gold. He presumed the case in point to be one of murder and robbery; doubtless there must be a rich spoil; how was it to be secured into the legitimate hands of the law? for as to merely entrapping the delinquent—that would be feeding the gallows; but entrapping the booty—that would be enriching the judge, and such, according to his creed, was the great end of justice. So thinking, he summoned to his presence his trustiest alguazil—a gaunt, hungry-looking varlet, clad, according to the custom of his order, in the ancient Spanish garb, a broad black beaver turned up at its sides; a quaint ruff; a small black cloak dangling from his shoulders; rusty black under-clothes that set off his spare wiry frame, while in his hand he bore a slender white wand, the dreaded insignia of his office. Such was the legal bloodhound of the ancient Spanish breed, that he put upon the traces of the unlucky water-carrier, and such was his speed and certainty, that he was upon the haunches of poor Peregil before he had returned to his dwelling, and brought both him and his donkey before the dispenser of justice.

The alcalde bent upon him one of the most terrific frowns. “Hark ye, culprit!” roared he, in a voice that made the knees of the little Gallego smite together,—“hark ye, culprit! there is no need of denying thy guilt, every thing is known to me. A gallows is the proper reward for the crime thou hast committed, but I am merciful, and readily listen to reason. The man that has been murdered in thy house was a Moor, an infidel, the enemy of our faith. It was doubtless in a fit of religious zeal that thou hast slain him. I will be indulgent, therefore; render up the property of which thou hast robbed him, and we will hush the matter up.”

The poor water-carrier called upon all the saints to witness his innocence; alas! not one of them appeared; and if they had, the alcalde would have disbelieved the whole calendar. The water-carrier related the whole story of the dying Moor with the straightforward simplicity of truth, but it was all in vain. “Wilt thou persist in saying,” demanded the judge, “that this Moslem had neither gold nor jewels, which were the object of thy cupidity?”

“As I hope to be saved, your worship,” replied the water-carrier, “he had nothing but a small box of sandal-wood which he bequeathed to me in reward for my services.”

“A box of sandal-wood! a box of sandal-wood!” exclaimed the alcalde, his eyes sparkling at the idea of precious jewels. “And where is this box? where have you concealed it?”

“An' it please your grace,” replied the water-carrier, “it is in one of the panniers of my mule, and heartily at the service of your worship.”

He had hardly spoken the words, when the keen alguazil darted off, and reappeared in an instant with the mysterious box of sandal-wood. The alcalde opened it with an eager and trembling hand; all pressed forward to gaze upon the treasures it was expected to contain; when, to their disappointment, nothing appeared within, but a parchment scroll, covered with Arabic characters, and an end of a waxen taper.

When there is nothing to be gained by the conviction of a prisoner, justice, even in Spain, is apt to be impartial. The alcalde, having recovered from his disappointment, and found that there was really no booty in the case, now listened dispassionately to the explanation of the water-carrier, which was corroborated by the testimony of his wife. Being convinced, therefore, of his innocence, he discharged him from arrest; nay more, he permitted him to carry off the Moor's legacy, the box of sandal-wood and its contents, as the well-merited reward of his humanity; but he retained his donkey in payment of costs and charges.

Behold the unfortunate little Gallego reduced once more to the necessity of being his own water-carrier, and trudging up to the well of the Alhambra with a great earthen jar upon his shoulder.

As he toiled up the hill in the heat of a summer noon, his usual good humor forsook him. “Dog of an alcalde!” would he cry, “to rob a poor man of the means of his subsistence, of the best friend he had in the world!” And then at the remembrance of the beloved companion of his labors, all the kindness of his nature would break forth. “Ah, donkey of my heart!” would he exclaim, resting his burden on a stone, and wiping the sweat from his brow—“Ah, donkey of my heart! I warrant me thou thinkest of thy old master! I warrant me thou missest the water-jars—poor beast.”

To add to his afflictions, his wife received him, on his return home, with whimperings and repinings; she had clearly the vantage-ground of him, having warned him not to commit the egregious act of hospitality which had brought on him all these misfortunes; and, like a knowing woman, she took every occasion to throw her superior sagacity in his teeth. If her children lacked food, or needed a new garment, she could answer with a sneer—“Go to your father—he is heir to King Chico of the Alhambra: ask him to help you out of the Moor's strong box.”

Was ever poor mortal so soundly punished for having done a good action? The unlucky Peregil was grieved in flesh and spirit, but still he bore meekly with the railings of his spouse. At length, one evening, when, after a hot day's toil, she taunted him in the usual manner, he lost all patience. He did not venture to retort upon her, but his eye rested upon the box of sandal-wood which lay on a shelf with lid half open, as if laughing in mockery at his vexation. Seizing it up, he dashed it with indignation to the floor: “Unlucky was the day that I ever set eyes on thee,” he cried, “or sheltered thy master beneath my roof!”

As the box struck the floor, the lid flew wide open, and the parchment scroll rolled forth.

Peregil sat regarding the scroll for some time in moody silence. At length rallying his ideas: “Who knows,” thought he, “but this writing may be of some importance, as the Moor seems to have guarded it with such care?” Picking it up therefore, he put it in his bosom, and the next morning, as he was crying water through the streets, he stopped at the shop of a Moor, a native of Tangiers, who sold trinkets and perfumery in the Zacatin, and asked him to explain the contents.

The Moor read the scroll attentively, then stroked his beard and smiled. “This manuscript,” said he, “is a form of incantation for the recovery of hidden treasure, that is under the power of enchantment. It is said to have such virtue that the strongest bolts and bars, nay the adamantine rock itself, will yield before it!”

“Bah!” cried the little Gallego, “what is all that to me? I am no enchanter, and know nothing of buried treasure.” So saying, he shouldered his water-jar, left the scroll in the hands of the Moor, and trudged forward on his daily rounds.

That evening, however, as he rested himself about twilight at the well of the Alhambra, he found a number of gossips assembled at the place, and their conversation, as is not unusual at that shadowy hour, turned upon old tales and traditions of a supernatural nature. Being all poor as rats, they dwelt with peculiar fondness upon the popular theme of enchanted riches left by the Moors in various parts of the Alhambra. Above all, they concurred in the belief that there were great treasures buried deep in the earth under the tower of the seven floors.

These stories made an unusual impression on the mind of the honest Peregil, and they sank deeper and deeper into his thoughts as he returned alone down the darkling avenues. “If, after all, there should be treasure hid beneath that tower: and if the scroll I left with the Moor should enable me to get at it!” In the sudden ecstasy of the thought he had well nigh let fall his water-jar.

That night he tumbled and tossed, and could scarcely get a wink of sleep for the thoughts that were bewildering his brain. Bright and early, he repaired to the shop of the Moor, and told him all that was passing in his mind. “You can read Arabic,” said he, “suppose we go together to the tower, and try the effect of the charm; if it fails we are no worse off than before; but if it succeeds, we will share equally all the treasure we may discover.”

“Hold,” replied the Moslem; “this writing is not sufficient of itself; it must be read at midnight, by the light of a taper singularly compounded and prepared, the ingredients of which are not within my reach. Without such a taper the scroll is of no avail.”

“Say no more!” cried the little Gallego; “I have such a taper at hand, and will bring it here in a moment.” So saying, he hastened home, and soon returned with the end of yellow wax taper that he had found in the box of sandal-wood.

The Moor felt it and smelt to it. “Here are rare and costly perfumes,” said he, “combined with this yellow wax. This is the kind of taper specified in the scroll. While this burns, the strongest walls and most secret caverns will remain open. Woe to him, however, who lingers within until it be extinguished. He will remain enchanted with the treasure.”

It was now agreed between them to try the charm that very night. At a late hour, therefore, when nothing was stirring but bats and owls, they ascended the woody hill of the Alhambra, and approached that awful tower, shrouded by trees and rendered formidable by so many traditionary tales. By the light of a lantern they groped their way through bushes, and over fallen stones, to the door of a vault beneath the tower. With fear and trembling they descended a flight of steps cut into the rock. It led to an empty chamber damp and drear, from which another flight of steps led to a deeper vault. In this way they descended four several flights, leading into as many vaults one below the other, but the floor of the fourth was solid; and though, according to tradition, there remained three vaults still below, it was said to be impossible to penetrate further, the residue being shut up by strong enchantment. The air of this vault was damp and chilly, and had an earthy smell, and the light scarce cast forth any rays. They paused here for a time in breathless suspense, until they faintly heard the clock of the watch-tower strike midnight; upon this they lit the waxen taper, which diffused an odor of myrrh and frankincense and storax.

The Moor began to read in a hurried voice. He had scarce finished when there was a noise as of subterraneous thunder. The earth shook, and the floor, yawning open, disclosed a flight of steps. Trembling with awe they descended, and by the light of the lantern found themselves in another vault, covered with Arabic inscriptions. In the centre stood a great chest, secured with seven bands of steel, at each end of which sat an enchanted Moor in armor, but motionless as a statue, being controlled by the power of the incantation. Before the chest were several jars filled with gold and silver and precious stones. In the largest of these they thrust their arms up to the elbow, and at every dip hauled forth handfuls of broad yellow pieces of Moorish gold, or bracelets and ornaments of the same precious metal, while occasionally a necklace of oriental pearl would stick to their fingers. Still they trembled and breathed short while cramming their pockets with the spoils; and cast many a fearful glance at the two enchanted Moors, who sat grim and motionless, glaring upon them with unwinking eyes. At length, struck with a sudden panic at some fancied noise, they both rushed up the staircase, tumbled over one another into the upper apartment, overturned and extinguished the waxen taper, and the pavement again closed with a thundering sound.

Filled with dismay, they did not pause until they had groped their way out of the tower, and beheld the stars shining through the trees. Then seating themselves upon the grass, they divided the spoil, determining to content themselves for the present with this mere skimming of the jars, but to return on some future night and drain them to the bottom. To make sure of each other's good faith, also, they divided the talismans between them, one retaining the scroll and the other the taper; this done, they set off with light hearts and well-lined pockets for Granada.

As they wended their way down the hill, the shrewd Moor whispered a word of counsel in the ear of the simple little water-carrier.

“Friend Peregil,” said he, “all this affair must be kept a profound secret until we have secured the treasure, and conveyed it out of harm's way. If a whisper of it gets to the ear of the alcalde, we are undone!”

“Certainly,” replied the Gallego, “nothing can be more true.”

“Friend Peregil,” said the Moor, “you are a discreet man, and I make no doubt can keep a secret: but you have a wife.”

“She shall not know a word of it,” replied the little water-carrier, sturdily.

“Enough,” said the Moor, “I depend upon thy discretion and thy promise.”

Never was promise more positive and sincere; but, alas! what man can keep a secret from his wife? Certainly not such a one as Peregil the water-carrier, who was one of the most loving and tractable of husbands. On his return home, he found his wife moping in a corner. “Mighty well,” cried she as he entered, “you've come at last; after rambling about until this hour of the night. I wonder you have not brought home another Moor as a house-mate.” Then bursting into tears, she began to wring her hands and smite her breast: “Unhappy woman that I am!” exclaimed she, “what will become of me? My house stripped and plundered by lawyers and alguazils; my husband a do-no-good, that no longer brings home bread to his family, but goes rambling about day and night, with infidel Moors! O my children! my children! what will become of us? We shall all have to beg in the streets!”

Honest Peregil was so moved by the distress of his spouse, that he could not help whimpering also. His heart was as full as his pocket, and not to be restrained. Thrusting his hand into the latter he hauled forth three or four broad gold pieces, and slipped them into her bosom. The poor woman stared with astonishment, and could not understand the meaning of this golden shower. Before she could recover her surprise, the little Gallego drew forth a chain of gold and dangled it before her, capering with exultation, his mouth distended from ear to ear.

“Holy Virgin protect us!” exclaimed the wife. “What hat thou been doing, Peregil? surely thou hast not been committing murder and robbery!”

The idea scarce entered the brain of the poor woman, than it became a certainty with her. She saw a prison and a gallows in the distance, and a little bandy-legged Gallego hanging pendant from it; and, overcome by the horrors conjured up by her imagination, fell into violent hysterics.

What could the poor man do? He had no other means of pacifying his wife, and dispelling the phantoms of her fancy, than by relating the whole story of his good fortune. This, however, he did not do until he had exacted from her the most solemn promise to keep it a profound secret from every living being.

To describe her joy would be impossible. She flung her arms round the neck of her husband, and almost strangled him with her caresses. “Now, wife,” exclaimed the little man with honest exultation, “what say you now to the Moor's legacy? Henceforth never abuse me for helping a fellow-creature in distress.”

The honest Gallego retired to his sheep-skin mat, and slept as soundly as if on a bed of down. Not so his wife; she emptied the whole contents of his pockets upon the mat, and sat counting gold pieces of Arabic coin, trying on necklaces and earrings, and fancying the figure she should one day make when permitted to enjoy her riches.

On the following morning the honest Gallego took a broad golden coin, and repaired with it to a jeweller's shop in the Zacatin to offer it for sale, pretending to have found it among the ruins of the Alhambra. The jeweller saw that it had an Arabic inscription, and was of the purest gold; he offered, however, but a third of its value, with which the water-carrier was perfectly content. Peregil now bought new clothes for his little flock, and all kinds of toys, together with ample provisions for a hearty meal, and returning to his dwelling, sat all his children dancing around him, while he capered in the midst, the happiest of fathers.

The wife of the water-carrier kept her promise of secrecy with surprising strictness. For a whole day and a half she went about with a look of mystery and a heart swelling almost to bursting, yet she held her peace, though surrounded by her gossips. It is true, she could not help giving herself a few airs, apologized for her ragged dress, and talked of ordering a new basquina all trimmed with gold lace and bugles, and a new lace mantilla. She threw out hints of her husband's intention of leaving off his trade of water-carrying, as it did not altogether agree with his health. In fact she thought they should all retire to the country for the summer, that the children might have the benefit of the mountain air, for there was no living in the city in this sultry season.

The neighbors stared at each other, and thought the poor woman had lost her wits; and her airs and graces and elegant pretensions were the theme of universal scoffing and merriment among her friends, the moment her back was turned.

If she restrained herself abroad, however, she indemnified herself at home, and putting a string of rich Oriental pearls round her neck, Moorish bracelets on her arms, and an aigrette of diamonds on her head, sailed backwards and forwards in her slattern rags about the room, now and then stopping to admire herself in a broken mirror. Nay, in the impulse of her simple vanity, she could not resist, on one occasion, showing herself at the window to enjoy the effect of her finery on the passers by.

As the fates would have it, Pedrillo Pedrugo, the meddlesome barber, was at this moment sitting idly in his shop on the opposite side of the street, when his ever-watchful eye caught the sparkle of a diamond. In an instant he was at his loophole reconnoitering the slattern spouse of the water-carrier, decorated with the splendor of an eastern bride. No sooner had he taken an accurate inventory of her ornaments, than he posted off with all speed to the alcalde. In a little while the hungry alguazil was again on the scent, and before the day was over the unfortunate Peregil was once more dragged into the presence of the judge.

“How is this, villain!” cried the alcalde, in a furious voice. “You told me that the infidel who died in your house left nothing behind but an empty coffer, and now I hear of your wife flaunting in her rags decked out with pearls and diamonds. Wretch that thou art! prepare to render up the spoils of thy miserable victim, and to swing on the gallows that is already tired of waiting for thee.”

The terrified water-carrier fell on his knees, and made a full relation of the marvellous manner in which he had gained his wealth. The alcalde, the alguazil, and the inquisitive barber, listened with greedy ears to this Arabian tale of enchanted treasure. The alguazil was dispatched to bring the Moor who had assisted in the incantation. The Moslem entered half frightened out of his wits at finding himself in the hands of the harpies of the law. When he beheld the water-carrier standing with sheepish looks and downcast countenance, he comprehended the whole matter. “Miserable animal,” said he, as he passed near him, “did I not warn thee against babbling to thy wife?”

The story of the Moor coincided exactly with that of his colleague; but the alcalde affected to be slow of belief, and threw out menaces of imprisonment and rigorous investigation.

“Softly, good Señor Alcalde,” said the Mussulman, who by this time had recovered his usual shrewdness and self-possession. “Let us not mar fortune's favors in the scramble for them. Nobody knows any thing of this matter but ourselves; let us keep the secret. There is wealth enough in the cave to enrich us all. Promise a fair division, and all shall be produced; refuse, and the cave shall remain for ever closed.”

The alcalde consulted apart with the alguazil. The latter was an old fox in his profession. “Promise any thing,” said he, “until you get possession of the treasure. You may then seize upon the whole, and if he and his accomplice dare to murmur, threaten them with the fagot and the stake as infidels and sorcerers.”

The alcalde relished the advice. Smoothing his brow and turning to the Moor, “This is a strange story,” said he, “and may be true, but I must have ocular proof of it. This very night you must repeat the incantation in my presence. If there be really such treasure, we will share it amicably between us, and say nothing further of the matter; if ye have deceived me, expect no mercy at my hands. In the mean time you must remain in custody.”

The Moor and the water-carrier cheerfully agreed to these conditions, satisfied that the event would prove the truth of their words.

Towards midnight the alcalde sallied forth secretly, attended by the alguazil and the meddlesome barber, all strongly armed. They conducted the Moor and the water-carrier as prisoners, and were provided with the stout donkey of the latter to bear off the expected treasure. They arrived at the tower without being observed, and tying the donkey to a fig-tree, descended into the fourth vault of the tower.

The scroll was produced, the yellow waxen taper lighted, and the Moor read the form of incantation. The earth trembled as before, and the pavement opened with a thundering sound, disclosing the narrow flight of steps. The alcalde, the alguazil, and the barber were struck aghast, and could not summon courage to descend. The Moor and the water-carrier entered the lower vault, and found the two Moors seated as before, silent and motionless. They removed two of the great jars, filled with golden coin and precious stones. The water-carrier bore them up one by one upon his shoulders, but though a strong-backed little man, and accustomed to carry burdens, he staggered beneath their weight, and found, when slung on each side of his donkey, they were as much as the animal could bear.

“Let us be content for the present,” said the Moor; “here is as much treasure as we can carry off without being perceived, and enough to make us all wealthy to our heart's desire.”

“Is there more treasure remaining behind?” demanded the alcalde.

“The greatest prize of all,” said the Moor, “a huge coffer bound with bands of steel, and filled with pearls and precious stones.”

“Let us have up the coffer by all means,” cried the grasping alcalde.

“I will descend for no more,” said the Moor, doggedly; “enough is enough for a reasonable man—more is superfluous.”

“And I,” said the water-carrier, “will bring up no further burden to break the back of my poor donkey.”

Finding commands, threats, and entreaties equally vain, the alcalde turned to his two adherents. “Aid me,” said he, “to bring up the coffer, and its contents shall be divided between us.” So saying he descended the steps, followed with trembling reluctance by the alguazil and the barber.

No sooner did the Moor behold them fairly earthed than he extinguished the yellow taper; the pavement closed with its usual crash, and the three worthies remained buried in its womb.

He then hastened up the different flights of steps, nor stopped until in the open air. The little water-carrier followed him as fast as his short legs would permit.

“What hast thou done?” cried Peregil, as soon as he could recover breath. “The alcalde and the other two are shut up in the vault.”

“It is the will of Allah!” said the Moor devoutly.

“And will you not release them?” demanded the Gallego.

“Allah forbid!” replied the Moor, smoothing his beard. “It is written in the book of fate that they shall remain enchanted until some future adventurer arrive to break the charm. The will of God be done!” so saying, he hurled the end of the waxen taper far among the gloomy thickets of the glen.

There was now no remedy, so the Moor and the water-carrier proceeded with the richly laden donkey toward the city, nor could honest Peregil refrain from hugging and kissing his long-eared fellow-laborer, thus restored to him from the clutches of the law; and in fact, it is doubtful which gave the simple hearted little man most joy at the moment, the gaining of the treasure, or the recovery of the donkey.

The two partners in good luck divided their spoil amicably and fairly, except that the Moor, who had a little taste for trinketry, made out to get into his heap the most of the pearls and precious stones and other baubles, but then he always gave the water-carrier in lieu magnificent jewels of massy gold, of five times the size, with which the latter was heartily content. They took care not to linger within reach of accidents, but made off to enjoy their wealth undisturbed in other countries. The Moor returned to Africa, to his native city of Tangiers, and the Gallego, with his wife, his children, and his donkey, made the best of his way to Portugal. Here, under the admonition and tuition of his wife, he became a personage of some consequence, for she made the worthy little man array his long body and short legs in doublet and hose, with a feather in his hat and a sword by his side, and laying aside his familiar appellation of Peregil, assume the more sonorous title of Don Pedro Gil: his progeny grew up a thriving and merry-hearted, though short and bandy-legged generation, while Señora Gil, befringed, belaced, and betasselled from her head to her heels, with glittering rings on every finger, became a model of slattern fashion and finery.

As to the alcalde and his adjuncts, they remained shut up under the great tower of the seven floors, and there they remain spell-bound at the present day. Whenever there shall be a lack in Spain of pimping barbers, sharking alguazils, and corrupt alcaldes, they may be sought after; but if they have to wait until such time for their deliverance, there is danger of their enchantment enduring until doomsday.
