木偶奇遇记


译者序


《木偶奇遇记》是意大利著名儿童文学作家卡洛·科洛迪（Carlo Collodi，1826—1890年）脍炙人口的代表作，被誉为“意大利儿童读物的杰作”“意大利儿童读物中最美的书”。

卡洛·科洛迪原名卡洛·洛伦齐尼，1826年11月24日出生在意大利托斯卡纳地区科洛迪小镇。他的笔名便是由这个小镇的名称而来。科洛迪精通法文，曾翻译过法国作家贝洛的童话。他也曾写过许多短篇小说、随笔、评论，还写过《小手杖游意大利》《小手杖地理》《快乐的故事》等童书，其中最著名的是他的童话故事《木偶奇遇记》，这个童话想象力丰富，人物形象栩栩如生，故事情节曲折动人，为他赢得了盛誉。

意大利著名学者达尼埃拉·玛凯斯基教授曾经这样说过：“在世界范围内，除了《圣经》和《古兰经》之外，《木偶奇遇记》是拥有读者最多、销量最高的作品。”

《木偶奇遇记》说的是一个名叫杰佩托的没有孩子的老头，用木头雕刻出了一个既会跳舞、击剑，又会翻跟头的木偶人，给他起名叫匹诺曹。虽然匹诺曹一直想做一个好孩子，但他难改身上的坏毛病。他逃学，撒谎，结交坏朋友，屡教不改。后来，一个天蓝色头发的仙女教育了他，每当他说谎时，他的鼻子就长一截，如果他连说三次谎，鼻子长得连在屋里转身都转不成了。这时，匹诺曹才开始醒悟，但他还是经不住坏孩子引诱，又跟着他们去了玩具国。几个月后，匹诺曹的头上长出了一对驴耳朵，变成了一头驴子，并被卖到了马戏团。不久，匹诺曹在演出中摔断了腿，又被马戏团老板卖给了商人去剥皮做鼓面。在这紧急关头，还是仙女解救了他。最后，匹诺曹决定痛改前非，在美丽善良的仙女姐姐的帮助下逐渐改掉了坏毛病，终于修成了正果。

《木偶奇遇记》语言生动幽默，想象丰富大胆，充满了无尽的童趣，超越了时代、国界和年龄的限制，使我们重新回望过去，重访童年的家园，为漂泊的心找回了镜子里的自己。

第一章


木匠樱桃师傅是怎么碰巧发现一截娃娃般会哭会笑的木头的？



几百年前住着——

“一位国王！”我的小读者们可能马上会说。

不，孩子们，你们错了。从前有一截木头，那不是一截贵重木头，根本不是，仅仅是一截普通木柴，它又粗又实，冬天放在火上，会使寒冷的屋子温暖舒适。

我不知道到底是怎么回事，但事实就是，一个晴天，这截木头发现自己到了一位老木匠的铺子里。木匠的真名叫安东尼奥师傅，但人人都叫他樱桃师傅，因为他的鼻尖圆圆的、红红的、亮亮的，就像一颗成熟的樱桃。

一看到那截木头，樱桃师傅就心花怒放，他高兴地搓着手，喃喃自语：“这截木头来得正是时候。我要用它做桌腿。”

他飞快地抓起短柄斧，要削掉树皮，砍出桌腿的形状。但是，他正准备砍第一斧，却举起手臂，站住不动了，因为他听到一个细小的声音哀求说：“请小心！别砍我太狠了！”

樱桃师傅的脸上闪现出了多么惊讶的表情！他可笑的脸变得更加可笑了。

他用惊恐的眼睛扫视整间屋子，想找到那个细小的声音来自什么地方，但他连一个人也没有看到！他看了看长凳下面，没有人！他瞧了瞧壁橱里面，没有人！他在刨花里找了找，也没有人！他打开门往街两边瞅了瞅——还是没有人！

“噢，我明白了！”他说着，笑了笑，挠了挠假发，“这声音一准儿是我听错了。好了，好了，还是接着干活吧。”

他在那截木头上狠狠地砍了一下。

“噢，噢！你砍疼我了！”还是那个遥远的小小的声音嚷道。

樱桃师傅愣在那儿，眼睛鼓凸，嘴巴大张，舌头耷拉到了下巴上。

他一能重新开口说话，就吓得哆哆嗦嗦、结结巴巴地说：

“周围没有人，那个声音是从什么地方来的呢？也许是这截木头已经学会了像小孩子那样哭叫吧？我简直无法相信。这截木头在这儿——是一截普通木柴，跟其他所有的木柴一样，只能用来生炉子。难道，有人藏在里面？要是这样，那他就糟了，我要收拾他！”

说着，他双手抓住这截原木，开始狠心地把它撞来撞去。他把它扔在地上，撞到墙上，甚至扔到了天花板上。

他停下来竖起耳朵仔细听，听有没有呻吟声和哭泣声。他等了两分钟，没有声音；等了五分钟，也没有声音；等了十分钟，还是没有什么声音。

“噢，我明白了，”他一边苦笑，一边用一只手挠了挠假发，“那个小小的声音，一准儿是我想象的。好了，好了，还是接着干活吧！”

这个可怜的家伙吓得半死，于是就尽力哼着快乐的歌儿来壮胆。

他把短柄斧放在一边，拿起刨子，要把木头刨平，但他刚开始来回刨时，又听到了那个细小的声音。这次，那个细小的声音一边说，一边咯咯笑：“别刨了！噢，别刨了！哈哈哈！你把我的肚子刨痒了。”

这次，可怜的樱桃师傅像被雷击了一般倒了下来。等睁开眼睛时，他发现自己坐在地上。

他脸都变了色，就连鼻尖都吓得从红色变成了深紫色。





第二章


樱桃师傅把这截木头送给了他的朋友杰佩托，杰佩托拿起木头，要给自己做一个既会跳舞、击剑，又会翻跟头的木偶。



正在这时，咚咚咚响起了敲门声。

“进来。”木匠说，就连站起来的一点儿力气也没有了。

听到这话，门开了，一个短小精悍的小老头走了进来，他的名字叫杰佩托，但街坊四邻的男孩子们都叫他“玉米粥”，因为他常戴的黄色假发正好是黄玉米那样的颜色。

杰佩托脾气很坏。谁要是叫他玉米粥，谁就会倒霉。他会变得像野兽一样狂暴，谁也平息不了他的怒气。

“你好，安东尼奥师傅，”杰佩托说，“你在地上干什么？”

“我在教蚂蚁识字。”

“祝你成功！”

“是什么风把你吹到了这儿，杰佩托朋友？”

“是我的腿。你可能知道，安东尼奥师傅，我是来请你帮忙的。”

“随时乐意为你效劳。”木匠跪起来，回答说。

“今天早上，我想到了一个好主意。”

“那就说说看。”

“我想给自己做一个漂亮的牵线木偶，它一定会非常奇妙，是一个会跳舞、会击剑、会翻跟头的牵线木偶。我想带着它周游世界，为自己挣一口面包和一杯酒。你觉得怎么样？”

“好啊，玉米粥！”还是那个小小的声音喊道，没人知道那个声音是从哪儿来的。

听到有人喊自己玉米粥，杰佩托师傅脸色变得像红辣椒似的。他面向木匠，气呼呼地说道：

“你为什么要侮辱我？”

“谁侮辱你了？”

“你刚才叫我玉米粥。”

“我没有叫。”

“我想你以为是我叫的！可我知道是你叫的。”

“没叫！”

“叫了！”

“没叫！”

“叫了！”

他们越来越生气，说着说着就打了起来，最后又抓又咬，相互扇起了耳光。

打完架后，安东尼奥师傅两只手里抓着杰佩托的黄色假发，杰佩托发现自己的嘴里咬着木匠卷曲的假发。

“把我的假发还给我！”安东尼奥师傅粗声粗气地喊道。

“你把我的假发还给我，我们就和好。”

两个小老头各自又戴上了自己的假发，握了握手，发誓要做一辈子的好朋友。

“那好啊，杰佩托师傅，”木匠说，表明自己没有任何恶意，“你想要我为你效什么劳呢？”

“我想要一段木头做一个牵线木偶，你愿意给我吗？”

安东尼奥师傅确实非常高兴，马上走到长凳边，去拿那段曾把他吓得半死的木头。但是，当他正要把木头交给朋友时，木头却猛地一扭，从他手里滑出来，在可怜的杰佩托的瘦腿上撞了一下。

“啊！安东尼奥师傅，你这样送东西给人家文雅吗？你差点儿把我打瘸了！”

“我向你发誓我没有那样做！”

“难道是我做的不成！”

“是这截木头的过错。”

“你说得对，可别忘了是你把它扔到了我的腿上。”

“我没有扔。”

“撒谎。”

“杰佩托，不要侮辱我，否则我叫你玉米粥。”

“白痴。”

“玉米粥！”

“蠢驴！”

“玉米粥！”

“丑猴！”

“玉米粥！”

听到木匠第三次叫他玉米粥，杰佩托气昏了头，扑向木匠。于是，他们就狠狠地厮打起来。

打完这架后，安东尼奥师傅的鼻子上多了两道抓痕，杰佩托的上衣丢了两颗纽扣。因此，他们打了个平手，又握了握手，发誓要做一辈子的好朋友。

随后，杰佩托抱起那截好木头，谢过安东尼奥师傅，一瘸一拐地向家里走去。





第三章


杰佩托一回到家，就做成了木偶，把他称为匹诺曹。这个木偶最初的一些恶作剧。



尽管杰佩托的房子很小，但整洁舒适。这是底层的一间小屋，楼梯下有一扇小窗。家具简单得不能再简单了：一把很旧的椅子，一张摇摇晃晃的床，一张摇摇欲坠的桌子。放满燃木的壁炉画在门对面的墙上，火上面画着一口锅，锅里放满了东西，一直在欢快地沸腾着，冒出来的热气看上去像真的一样。

一到家里，杰佩托就拿起工具，动手把那截木头刻成了一个木偶。

“我叫他什么名字呢？”他自言自语说，“我想叫他匹诺曹。这个名字会让他发财的。我认识一家人，他们都叫匹诺曹：爸爸叫匹诺曹，妈妈叫匹诺曹，孩子们也叫匹诺曹，他们都很幸运，其中最富有的那个靠乞讨为生。”

杰佩托给木偶选好了名字，就开始认真地刻起了头发、额头和眼睛。

试想一下，当他发觉这两只眼睛转动起来，然后定定地看着他时，他是多么吃惊啊。看到这个情景，杰佩托感觉受到了侮辱，伤心地说道：“难看的木头眼睛，你为什么这样瞪着我呀？”

没有回答。

做完眼睛后，杰佩托又做起了鼻子。鼻子一做好，就开始长了起来，它长啊长啊长，已经变得很长很长了，还好像会一直长下去似的。

可怜的杰佩托一直不断地削啊削，但他越削，这只无礼的鼻子越长。无奈之际，他决定不再管这只鼻子了。

接下来是做嘴巴。嘴巴一做完，就开始哈哈大笑，嘲笑起了杰佩托。

“别笑了！”杰佩托生气地说，但他还不如对着墙说。

“我说，别笑了！”他大声吼道。

嘴巴不再笑了，却伸出了长舌头。

杰佩托不想跟它争论，假装什么也没有看到，继续干起了活儿。

做完嘴巴，他做下巴，接着做脖子、肩膀、肚子、胳膊和两只手。

正要准备最后修饰指尖时，杰佩托感到自己的假发被拽了下来。他抬起头来，看到了什么？只见他的黄色假发拿在了木偶的手里。

“匹诺曹，把假发给我！”

但是，匹诺曹没有给他，而是戴到了自己的头上，假发几乎把他整个头都罩在了里面。

对这个意想不到的恶作剧，杰佩托感到从来没有过的伤心和难过。“匹诺曹，你这个坏小子！”他大声嚷道，“我还没有把你做完，你就开始对你可怜的老父亲放肆无礼了！真坏，我的儿子，你真坏啊！”

说完，他擦掉了一滴眼泪。

接下来还要做腿和脚。杰佩托把腿和脚一做好，就感到鼻尖上狠狠地挨了一脚。

“我这是自作自受！”杰佩托自言自语说，“一开头我就应该想到这一点，现在太晚了！”

他抱住木偶的胳肢窝，把他放在地上，要教他走路。

匹诺曹的腿非常僵硬，不会移动。杰佩托抓住他的手，教他怎样一步一步地往前走。

等到腿一会动，匹诺曹就开始自己走了起来，接着满屋乱跑。他跑到敞开的门口，一下子蹦到了街上，飞快地跑走了！

可怜的杰佩托在后面追，但怎么也追不上，因为匹诺曹蹦蹦跳跳，像只野兔。他的两只木脚拍打在石街上，噼里啪啦的，就像二十个农夫穿着木屐发出的响声。

“抓住他！抓住他！”杰佩托不停地大叫。但是，看到一只木偶飞跑如风，街上的人只是静立不动盯着看，然后大声笑啊笑，直到把眼泪都笑了出来。

最后，幸亏一个宪兵(1)碰巧路过，他听到了嘈杂声，以为是一匹逃跑的小马驹，就勇敢地站在街中央，叉开两条腿，下定决心要拦住它，防止产生任何麻烦。

匹诺曹从远处看到了那名宪兵，就想尽力从这位大个子的两腿间逃过去，但没有成功。

宪兵一把就抓住了他的鼻子（那是一只特别长的鼻子，好像是有意做出来让宪兵抓的），把他交还给了杰佩托师傅。

小老头想拽匹诺曹的耳朵，他找来找去，发现竟忘了给木偶做耳朵，诸位想想他是多么惊讶吧！

杰佩托所能做的就是抓住匹诺曹的脖颈，把他带回家。他一边这样做，一边晃了木偶两三次，生气地对他说：“现在我们回家，等到家后，我们再算这笔账！”

听了这话，匹诺曹扑倒在地，一步也不肯再走了。人们一个个地围住他们俩，众说纷纭。

“可怜的木偶，”有个人大声嚷道，“他不想回家，我并不吃惊。毫无疑问，杰佩托这个坏蛋会狠心地揍他的。”

“杰佩托看上去是一个好人，”另一个人补充道，“而对孩子们来说，他是一个真正的暴徒。要是我们把那个可怜的木偶交到他手里，说不定他就会把木偶撕成碎片！”

他们议论纷纷，最后那位宪兵放开匹诺曹，把杰佩托送到了监狱。可怜的老人不知道如何自卫，而是像孩子似的一边号哭，一边哽咽着说：

“忘恩负义的小子！想一想我费了多么大的劲儿想把你做成一个规规矩矩的木偶啊！我这可是自作自受啊！我本该早就想到这一点啊。”

之后发生的故事简直让人难以相信，亲爱的孩子们，你们将会在下面各章一一看到的。

第四章


匹诺曹和会说话的蟋蟀的故事。从这个故事，我们看到坏孩子不喜欢让比他们懂得多的人来纠正他们。



不一会儿工夫，可怜的老杰佩托就被送进了牢房。与此同时，匹诺曹这个淘气鬼从宪兵的手里逃了出来，拼命地跑过田野和草地，抄近路朝家里奔去。他拼命逃窜，越过荆棘和矮树丛，越过小溪和池塘，好像一只被猎犬追赶的山羊或者野兔。

他跑到家时，发现房门半开，就悄悄地溜进去，插上门，扑倒在地，对自己的逃脱感到高兴。

但是，他的高兴劲儿只持续了一小会儿，因为正在这时他听到有一个声音说：“唧唧唧！”

“谁在叫我？”匹诺曹大惊失色地问道。

“是我！”

匹诺曹转过身，看到一只大蟋蟀正慢腾腾地往墙上爬。

“告诉我，蟋蟀，你是谁？”

“我是会说话的蟋蟀，已经在这屋里住了一百多年了。”

“这屋子今天可是我的了，”木偶说，“如果你肯帮帮忙，现在就出去，甚至连头也不要回一下。”

“我要给你讲完一个大道理，”蟋蟀回答说，“再离开这个地方。”

“那就讲讲，然后快走。”

“不听父母的话、离家出走的男孩子会倒霉的！他们在这个世界上永远不会幸福，等年龄大些，他们就会后悔的。”

“你高兴唱就唱下去吧，我的蟋蟀。可我知道的是，明天天不亮我就要永远离开这个地方了。要是我待在这儿，发生在所有其他男孩子和女孩子身上的事儿，也会发生在我的身上。他们会被送去上学，不管他们愿不愿意，都必须读书。至于我，让我告诉你，我讨厌学习！我想，追蝴蝶、爬树和掏鸟窝要有趣得多。”

“可怜的小傻瓜！难道你不知道，要是这样下去，你就会变成一头大蠢驴，成为所有人的笑柄吗？”

“别说了，你这丑蟋蟀！”匹诺曹叫道。

但是，蟋蟀像一位睿智的老哲学家，对匹诺曹的粗鲁无礼没有生气，而是继续用原来的口气说道：“要是你不喜欢上学，那你为何不至少学门手艺，这样你就能踏实生活。”

“我告诉你一些事好吗？”匹诺曹问，他开始失去了耐心，“在世界上所有的手艺中，只有一个真正合我的心意。”

“是什么呢？”

“那就是吃、喝、睡、玩，然后从早逛到晚。”

“匹诺曹，为了你自己好，让我告诉你，”会说话的蟋蟀还是那么心平气和地说，“那些以此为业的人，最后常常不是进医院就是进牢房。”

“当心点儿，丑蟋蟀！要是惹我生气，你会后悔的！”

“可怜的匹诺曹，我真为你感到遗憾。”

“为什么？”

“因为你是一个木偶，更为糟糕的是，你还有一个木头脑袋。”

听了最后这句话，匹诺曹暴跳起来，他从长凳上拿起一把锤子，用尽全力朝会说话的蟋蟀扔去。

也许他认为自己不会击中蟋蟀，然而，不幸的是，我可爱的孩子们，锤子真的直接砸在了可怜的小蟋蟀的头上。

可怜的小蟋蟀最后有气无力地唧唧唧叫了几声，就从墙上掉下来，一命呜呼了！





第五章


匹诺曹饿了，想找一个鸡蛋，为自己做一个煎蛋卷，而让他吃惊的是，煎蛋卷从窗户飞了出去。



如果说蟋蟀的死吓坏了匹诺曹的话，那也仅仅是片刻时间。因为随着夜幕降临，肚子里一阵莫名其妙的空虚感，使木偶想起了自己到现在还什么都没有吃过。

男孩子的食欲增长很快，过了一会儿，这种莫名其妙的空虚感就变成了饥饿感，饥饿感越来越强烈，很快他就像熊一样贪婪了。

可怜的匹诺曹向壁炉奔去，那儿的锅子正在沸腾。他伸手想揭开锅盖，而让他惊讶的是，锅子不过是画的！试想一下，他是什么感受啊！他的长鼻子至少又长了五厘米。

他满屋子乱跑，翻遍了所有的盒子和抽屉，甚至还看了看床下，想找一片面包，哪怕是一片干面包，或者是一点儿甜饼干、一小片鱼，就是狗啃剩的一块骨头让他尝尝也好啊，但他什么也没有找到。

这时，他越来越饿了。可怜的匹诺曹唯一的安慰就是打哈欠——他打的哈欠的确很大，嘴角都咧得贴住了耳朵尖。不久，他就开始头晕目眩。他独自哭哭啼啼地说道：“会说话的蟋蟀说得对，我错就错在不听爸爸的话，离家出走。要是他现在在这儿，我就不会这样饿了！噢，肚子饿真难受啊！”

突然，他看到一个角落的垃圾里有一个圆圆的、白白的东西，酷似一个鸡蛋，他一下子扑了上去。那的的确确是一个鸡蛋。

木偶高兴得无法形容，你必须自己去想象了。他觉得简直像是在做梦，就在手里把鸡蛋转来转去，又摸又亲，然后对鸡蛋说道：“现在我该怎么来吃你呢？我做煎蛋卷好吗？不，放在煎锅里煎更好！要么我把你喝了？不，最好是在煎锅里煎，这样，你会更有味道。”

说干就干，他把一个小煎锅放在一个堆满烧炭的脚炉上。他往煎锅里倒的不是食油或黄油，而是一点儿水。水一开始沸腾，他就咔嗒一声敲破蛋壳。但是，从里面出来的不是蛋白和蛋黄，而是一只小黄鸡。小鸡毛茸茸的，面带微笑，欢天喜地。它向匹诺曹礼貌地鞠个躬，说道：“多谢，真的非常感谢，匹诺曹先生，因为我不用费劲儿去弄破蛋壳了！再见，祝你好运，代我向你的家人问好！”

说完它就展开翅膀，从敞开的窗户飞了出去，飞到了空中，不见了踪影。

可怜的木偶站在那儿，仿佛变成了石头，他眼睛圆睁，嘴巴大张，手里拿着磕成两半的蛋壳。他清醒过来时，就放开嗓子又哭又叫，一边在地上跺着脚，一边不停地哭叫道：“会说话的蟋蟀说得对！要是我不离家出走，要是爸爸现在在这儿，我就不会饿得要命了。噢，肚子饿真难受啊！”

因为他的肚子一直咕噜咕噜响，越响越厉害，而又没有东西让它平息，所以他就想出去，到附近的村子走走，希望能碰到一个厚道人，送给他一点儿面包吃。





第六章


匹诺曹把一双脚放在脚炉上倒头睡去，第二天早晨醒来时他的脚被烧掉了。



匹诺曹不喜欢黑暗的街道，但他饥肠辘辘，所以就不顾街道的黑暗，跑出了房子。夜黑漆漆的，雷声隆隆，电光不时地闪过天空，把天空变成了一片火海。狂风冷冷地吹着，卷起滚滚烟尘，同时树木摇晃，怪声呜咽。

匹诺曹非常害怕电闪雷鸣，但肚子饿要比电闪雷鸣可怕得多。他连蹦带跳了几十下来到一个村子，早已是筋疲力尽，他像鲸鱼一样噗噗吹着气，舌头耷拉着。

整个村子一片漆黑，连一个人影也没有。店铺都关门了，各家各户也关门闭窗，街上连一只狗也看不到，整个村子好像一个死人村。

匹诺曹绝望地跑到一个门口，扑倒在门铃上，一边拼命地拉铃，一边自言自语道：“肯定会有人开门的！”

他说得没错，一个戴着睡帽的老头打开窗户，伸出头，朝下面怒气冲冲地喊道：“你深更半夜想要干什么？”

“你行行好，给我一点儿面包好吗？我很饿。”

“等一会儿，我马上下来。”老头回答说，心里想他必须要收拾一下喜欢深更半夜四处游荡，在人们安睡时拉门铃的小子。

过了一两分钟，还是那个声音叫道：“站在窗下，伸出你的帽子！”

匹诺曹没有帽子，但他设法走到窗下，这时正好一大盆冰水泼在了他可怜的木头脑袋、肩膀和身上。

他像落汤鸡似的回到家里，因为又累又饿，筋疲力尽，没有力气站起来，就坐在一个小凳子上，把两只脚放在脚炉上烤干。

他就这样睡着了。他睡着时，一双木头脚开始燃烧起来，慢慢地，它们烧黑了，变成了灰烬。

匹诺曹一直欢快地打着呼噜，好像这双脚不是他自己的。黎明时分，一阵咚咚咚的敲门声响起时，他睁开了眼睛。

“是谁呀？”他打着哈欠、揉着眼睛问道。

“是我。”一个声音回答说。

这是杰佩托的声音。





第七章


杰佩托回到家里，把自己的早饭给了匹诺曹。



可怜的匹诺曹仍然半睡半醒，还没有发现他的两只脚已经被烧没了。一听到爸爸的声音，他就跳下凳子要去开门，但是，他踉踉跄跄头朝前栽倒在了地板上。

他倒下时发出的声音，就像是一袋木头从一座房子的五层楼上落下来似的。

“给我开门！”杰佩托从街上叫道。

“爸爸，亲爱的爸爸，我开不了门。”木偶绝望地回答说，又是号哭，又是在地上打滚。

“你为什么开不了？”

“因为有人吃掉了我的两只脚。”

“是谁吃掉了它们？”

“是猫。”匹诺曹回答说，他看到那只猫正在屋角忙着玩一些刨花。

“开门！我说，”杰佩托随声附和说，“否则我进屋就狠狠地抽你一顿。”

“爸爸，相信我，我站不起来了。哎哟！哎哟！我一辈子都得用膝盖走路了。”

杰佩托以为木偶又哭又叫又是在捣鬼，就从窗户爬进了屋子。

起先，杰佩托非常生气，但当看到匹诺曹躺在地上，真的没有脚时，他伤心难过极了。杰佩托把匹诺曹从地板上扶起来，爱抚和拥抱他，眼泪顺着脸颊滚滚而下，他哭着说：

“我的小匹诺曹，我亲爱的小匹诺曹！你是怎么烧掉了自己的脚啊？”

“爸爸，我不知道，但相信我，这是一个可怕的夜晚，我一辈子都会记住的。电闪雷鸣——我很饿，当时，会说话的蟋蟀对我说：‘你自作自受；你很坏。’我对它说：‘小心，蟋蟀。’它对我说：‘你是木偶，有一个木头脑袋。’我拿起锤子扔向它，把它砸死了。这是它自己的过错，因为我并不想砸死它。然后，我把煎锅放在炭火上，想做煎蛋卷，我敲破蛋壳，但小鸡跑出来说：‘再见！代我向你的家人问好。’我越来越饿，就走出去，一个戴着睡帽的老头将头探出窗外，泼了我一身水。我回到家里，把脚放在脚炉上想烤干，因为我仍然很饿，所以就倒头睡着了。现在我的脚没有了，但我的饥饿感却没有消失！噢！——噢！——噢！”

这时，可怜的匹诺曹开始哭叫起来，哭声非常响亮，方圆几里都能听得到。

杰佩托听他乱七八糟说了这么多，只听明白一点，就是木偶很饿。他为他感到难过，就从口袋里掏出三个梨，递给他，说道：

“这三个梨是我的早饭，但我很高兴送给你。吃吧，不要哭了。”

“你要是给我吃，请给我把皮削掉。”

“削皮？”杰佩托十分吃惊地问道，“我亲爱的孩子，我从来没有想到，你对食物这样挑三拣四。坏，真坏！在这个世界上，甚至小时候，我们必须让自己习惯见什么吃什么，因为我们从来不知道等待我们的会是什么生活！”

“你说得没错，”匹诺曹回答说，“但是，梨子不削皮，我是不会吃的，我不喜欢那样吃。”

老好人杰佩托拿出小刀，削好了三个梨，然后把梨皮连成一行都放在桌子上。

匹诺曹转眼就吃掉了一个梨。他正要扔掉梨核，杰佩托却抓住了他的手臂说：“噢，不，不要扔掉！这个世界上的所有东西都会有用的。”

“梨核我可是不会吃的！”匹诺曹生气地叫道。

“谁知道呢！”杰佩托心平气和地重复道。

随后，三个梨核就被放在了梨皮旁边的桌子上。

匹诺曹吃了三个梨，或者更准确地说，吞下了三个梨，然后深深地打了个哈欠，哀号说：“我还饿。”

“可是，我再没有什么给你了。”

“真的，没有——没有什么东西了？”

“我只剩下这三个梨核和这些梨皮了。”

“那很好，”匹诺曹说，“要是没有别的什么东西，我就把它们吃了吧。”

起先，他还做了个鬼脸，但梨皮和梨核一个接一个都不见了踪影。

“啊！现在我感觉好多了！”吃完最后一个后，他说道。

“你看，”杰佩托说，“我刚才对你说的没错吧，一个人对食物不能太挑三拣四。我的宝贝，我们从来不知道等待我们的会是什么生活！”





第八章


杰佩托为匹诺曹做了一双新脚，卖了自己的上衣，给他买识字课本。



木偶一缓解饥饿，就开始嘟嘟囔囔哭着想要一双新脚。

但是，为了惩罚他搞了恶作剧，杰佩托师傅整个上午都没有管他。吃过饭后，他对木偶说：

“我为什么要给你再做一双脚呢？难道是为了看着你又一次从家里跑出去？”

“我向你保证，”木偶哭着回答说，“从现在起我要做一个好——”

“男孩子想要什么东西时总是许诺。”杰佩托说。

“我保证每天上学、学习、成功——”

“男孩子想得到什么东西时，总是这样说。”

“我和别的男孩子可不一样！我比他们都好，我总是说真话。爸爸，我向你保证，我要学会一门手艺，等你老了，我就安慰你、赡养你。”

尽管杰佩托表情非常严厉，但看到匹诺曹那样受罪，他热泪盈眶，心也软了。他二话没说，拿起工具和两块木头，一个劲儿地干了起来。

不到一小时，两只脚就做好了，是两只细小、灵活、有力、快捷的脚，就像是出自艺术家之手。

于是，杰佩托对木偶说：“闭上眼睡吧！”

木偶闭上眼假装睡觉，这时，杰佩托用鸡蛋壳装了点儿熔化胶粘上那两只脚，他粘得天衣无缝，几乎看不到上面的接缝。

木偶一感到自己有了新脚，就从桌子上一跃而起，开始跳来跳去，简直高兴得昏了头。

“爸爸，为了表达我对你是多么感激，我现在要去上学。可是，要去上学，我需要一身衣服。”

杰佩托口袋里连一个子儿也没有，所以他就用花纸给儿子做了一套小衣服，用树皮做了一双鞋，用一小块生面团做了一顶小帽子。

匹诺曹跑到一碗水边照了照自己，感到非常开心，神气十足地说：“现在我像一位绅士了！”

“的确像，”杰佩托回答说，“但你要记住，使人成为绅士的不是好衣服，而主要是干净整洁的衣服。”

“非常正确。”木偶答道，“可是，为了上学，我还需要一件重要的东西。”

“什么东西？”

“识字课本。”

“当然！可是，我们怎么弄到它呢？”

“那还不容易，我们去书店里买就是了。”

“钱呢？”

“我没有钱。”

“我也没有钱。”老人难过地说。

尽管匹诺曹是一个快乐的孩子，但听到这话，也伤心扫兴起来。当贫穷出现时，就连调皮的男孩子也明白是什么意思了。

“没法子，只好这么办！”杰佩托从椅子上跳起来大声叫道。他穿上补满补丁的旧上衣，二话没说，跑出了房子。

过了一会儿，他就回来了，手里拿着给儿子的识字课本，但那身旧上衣不见了。这个可怜人只穿着衬衣，天很冷。

“你的上衣呢，爸爸？”

“我已经卖了。”

“你为什么卖上衣？”

“太暖和了。”

匹诺曹马上明白了，忍不住流下了眼泪，他跳上杰佩托的脖子，一遍又一遍地吻了起来。





第九章


匹诺曹卖掉了识字课本，是为了有钱去看木偶戏。



看看匹诺曹胳膊夹着新识字课本匆匆去上学的情景吧！他一边向前走，一边在脑海里浮想联翩，忙着建造几百座空中楼阁。他自言自语：“在学校里，我今天要学会读书，明天要学会写字，后天要学会算术。然后，我就会变得聪明伶俐，就可以挣好多钱。我要用挣到的第一笔钱给爸爸买一件新布上衣。我刚才是说布的吗？不，要金银做的，还要缀钻石扣子。那位可怜人真该穿这样的衣服，因为毕竟他人好，为了给我买书，竟然把上衣也给卖了，只穿着衬衣，还是在这样冷的天！爸爸们对他们的孩子可真好啊！”

他自言自语，觉得自己听见远处有音乐声，又是吹笛子，又是敲鼓：嘀嘀嘀，嘀嘀嘀……咚咚咚咚。

他停下来侧耳倾听。那些声音是从一条通向沿岸一个村子的小街上传来的。

“那声音是怎么回事？真讨厌，我得去上学，否则……”

他站在那儿，左右为难。他认为自己必须得做出决定，是应该上学还是应该听吹笛子？

“我今天听吹笛子，明天上学。上学，时间有的是。”这个小淘气最后耸了耸肩决定说。

就这么定了，他顺着那条街一阵风似的跑了起来，他越往前跑，笛声和鼓声就越响亮：嘀嘀嘀，嘀嘀嘀，嘀嘀嘀，嘀嘀嘀……咚咚咚咚。

突然，他来到了一个大广场，一个色彩鲜艳的小木屋前面站满了人。

“那个房子是什么？”匹诺曹问附近的一个小男孩。

“念一下告示，你就知道了。”

“我很想去念，但我今天正好念不成。”

“噢，是吗？那我给你念一下。你看见告示上那几个火红的大字没有，这几个字写的是：木偶大戏院。”

“表演什么时候开始？”

“现在就要开始了。”

“多少钱可以入场？”

“四便士。”

匹诺曹好奇心很强，想知道里面正在进行什么，就失去所有的自尊，不知害臊地对那个男孩子说：“借给我四便士，明天还你好吗？”

“我很想借给你，”那个男孩子开玩笑说，“但现在，正好不能给你。”

“四便士，我把这件外套卖给你。”

“我要一件花纸外套做什么？要是下雨，那我就无法再脱下来了。”

“你想买我的鞋吗？”

“它们用来生火最好。”

“我的帽子怎么样？”

“真划算！一顶生面团帽子！老鼠说不定会来我的头上吃帽子呢！”

匹诺曹快要掉泪了，他准备卖最后一件东西，但又没有勇气这样做。他犹豫不决，下不了决心，十分苦恼，不过最后他还是说了：“你愿意给我四便士买这本书吗？”

“我是一个男孩子，我不买男孩子的任何东西。”那个小家伙说，他比木偶更有判断力。

“我给你四便士买这本识字课本。”站在旁边的一个拾破烂的说。

当场，书就转手了。想一想那个可怜的老杰佩托吧，他如今穿着衬衣坐在家里，冷得瑟瑟发抖，因为他为儿子买那本小书卖掉了自己的上衣！





第十章


木偶们认出了他们的兄弟匹诺曹，大声欢呼迎接他；但是，碰巧戏班班主吞火者走过来，可怜的匹诺曹差点儿丧命。



匹诺曹快如闪电般进了木偶戏院。随后，就发生了一件事，这件事差点儿引起骚乱。

幕布升起，表演已经开始了。

花衣小丑和驼背小丑正在舞台上你一句我一句，像往常一样，他们用棍子打来打去威胁对方。

戏院里人头攒动，人们一边欣赏这两个木偶表演，一边开怀大笑，直到他们对两个木偶的滑稽动作大喊起来。

表演又持续了几分钟，随后，花衣小丑没有任何提示，突然停止了说话，他转向观众，一边用手指着乐队后排，一边狂叫道：

“瞧，瞧啊！我是做梦还是醒着呢？我真的看到匹诺曹在那儿了吗？”

“是，是！正是匹诺曹！”驼背小丑尖叫道。

“就是！就是！”罗萨拉太太从戏台侧面伸头尖叫道。

“是匹诺曹！是匹诺曹！”所有的木偶都从戏台侧面涌出来高声叫道，“是匹诺曹！是我们的兄弟匹诺曹！匹诺曹万岁！”

“匹诺曹，上来，到我这儿，”花衣小丑喊道，“到你的木头兄弟们的怀抱里来吧！”

在他们的好心邀请下，匹诺曹一下子就从乐队后面跳到了前排，又一跳跳到了乐队指挥的头上，第三跳便跳上了戏台。

匹诺曹受到这群奇特的木偶戏男女演员的狂热欢迎，他们欢呼，他们热烈地拥抱他，友好地跟他像真诚的兄弟那样碰头，这个场面真是难以言表。

这是一个令人心碎的场面，但观众看到戏停了下来，就渐渐生气，开始大声嚷嚷：“戏，戏，我们要看戏！”

叫也没用，因为木偶们不仅没有继续演下去，反而加倍狂欢起来。他们把匹诺曹放在肩上，得意扬扬地抬着他绕着戏台转了起来。

正在这时，戏班班主从屋里走了出来，他样子可怕，叫人一看就心惊胆战。他的络腮胡又黑又长，从下巴一直拖到脚上。他的嘴宽得像炉口，牙齿像犬牙，眼睛有如两块烧红的煤球。他毛茸茸的大手里握着绿蛇皮和黑猫尾拧成的长鞭子，鞭子在空中飕飕作响，看起来非常危险。

没有料到班主突然出现，他们谁也不敢喘气，几乎连一只苍蝇飞过都能听得见，那些可怜的木偶一个个像暴风雨中的树叶那样瑟瑟发抖。

“你为什么到我的戏院里来捣乱？”那个大个子问匹诺曹，他的声音就像食人魔鬼得了感冒一样。

“先生，请你相信，这不是我的过错。”

“够了！别说了！我待会儿再收拾你。”

戏一演完，班主就来到厨房，那儿有一只大肥羊正在烤肉叉上慢慢地转动着。还需要更多的木柴来把羊烤熟。他叫来花衣小丑和驼背小丑，对他们说道：

“把那个木偶给我带过来！看上去他是用风干的木头做的，他在烤肉叉上一定会烧得很旺。”

花衣小丑和驼背小丑有点儿犹豫，可班主瞪了他们一眼，他们吓得离开厨房，领命而去。几分钟后，他们就带着可怜的匹诺曹回到了厨房。匹诺曹像鳗鱼一样扭来扭去，可怜巴巴地哭喊道：“爸爸，救救我！我不想死！我不想死啊！”





第十一章


吞火者打了个喷嚏，饶恕了匹诺曹，因为匹诺曹救了他的朋友花衣小丑一命。



戏院里，群情激动。

吞火者（这其实是他的名字）看上去非常粗鲁，但他绝不是坏人。事实证明，一看到可怜的匹诺曹被带到他面前，害怕得挣扎着哭叫：“我不想死！我不想死啊！”他就可怜起了匹诺曹，他先是动摇，后是犹豫，最后终于忍不住，打了个响亮的喷嚏。

听到那声喷嚏，一直很伤心、像垂柳那样弯下身子的花衣小丑露出了笑脸，向匹诺曹倾过身，低声对他说道：“好消息，我的兄弟！吞火者打喷嚏了，这是他可怜你的标志，你有救了！”

因为要知道，别人伤心难过时，会哭鼻子抹眼泪，而吞火者每次感动时却有打喷嚏的怪习惯。他是以这种方式表明他发善心了。

打过喷嚏后，吞火者还是那样粗鲁，对匹诺曹叫道：“别哭了！你一哭，让我这肚子里很不舒服——阿嚏——阿嚏！”两声响亮的喷嚏结束了他的谈话。

“上帝保佑你！”匹诺曹说。

“谢谢！你爸爸妈妈都还活着吗？”吞火者问道。

“爸爸活着，妈妈我从来不知道。”

“要是我把你当柴火烧掉，你可怜的爸爸就会非常痛苦。可怜的老头！我真可怜他啊！阿嚏！阿嚏！阿嚏！”他又打了三个喷嚏，一个比一个响亮。

“上帝保佑你！”匹诺曹说。

“谢谢！不过，我现在也该可怜我自己了，我的美餐被糟蹋了，我没有木柴生火了。羊只烤熟了一半。没关系！我要烧另一个木偶，来代替你。喂，过来！宪兵！”

一声命令，马上来了两个木头宪兵，他们像帆桁一样瘦长，头上戴着奇怪的帽子，手里握着剑。

吞火者嘶哑着嗓子对他们高声喊道：“抓住花衣小丑，把他捆住，扔到火上去。我要把这只羊烤熟！”

想一下可怜的花衣小丑是怎样的感受吧！他吓得两腿一弯，倒在地板上。

看到这个令人心碎的场面，匹诺曹扑倒在吞火者的脚边，一边痛哭，一边可怜巴巴地哀求，哀求声几乎听不见：“可怜可怜他吧，我求你了，先生！”

“这儿没有什么先生！”

“可怜可怜他吧，好心的先生！”

“这儿没有什么先生！”

“可怜可怜他吧，阁下！”

一听到匹诺曹喊自己阁下，木偶戏班班主在椅子上挺坐起来，捋着长胡子，突然变得亲切慈悲，他一边面带自豪的微笑，一边对匹诺曹说：“好了，你现在要我做什么，木偶？”

“我求你饶了我那可怜的朋友花衣小丑吧，他一生从来没有做过伤天害理的事。”

“这可没有什么可怜，匹诺曹，我已经饶恕了你，花衣小丑就必须替你去死。我饿了，我的羊必须烤熟。”

“那样的话，”匹诺曹自豪地说着，站起来，扔掉自己的生面团帽子，“那样的话，我知道我该怎么做了。来吧，宪兵！把我捆起来扔到火上去。不能让我在这个世界上最好的朋友可怜的花衣小丑替我去死，这不公平！”

这些勇敢的话说得动人心扉，使其他的木偶都哭了起来。就连那两个也是木头做的宪兵也像婴儿一样哭了起来。

吞火者起先像一块冰似的又冷又硬，但后来，他渐渐心软了，开始打起了喷嚏。打了四五个喷嚏后，他张开大大的怀抱，对匹诺曹说道：“你是一个勇敢的孩子！到我的怀抱里来，亲我一下！”

匹诺曹跑到他的身边，像一只松鼠似的顺着他的长黑胡子匆匆往上爬，然后在吞火者的鼻尖上深情地吻了一下。

“你已经饶了我吗？”可怜的花衣小丑几乎声如游丝地问道。

“饶你了！”吞火者回答说，然后叹了口气，摇了摇头，补充道，“噢，今天晚上我只好吃半生不熟的羊肉喽，但下次可要注意啊，木偶。”

听到班主饶恕的消息，木偶们都跑到戏台上，开亮所有的灯，载歌载舞，直到天亮。





第十二章


吞火者送给匹诺曹五枚金币，让他带给他的父亲杰佩托，但是，匹诺曹遇见了狐狸和猫，就跟它们走了。



第二天，吞火者把匹诺曹叫到一边，问他说：“你爸爸叫什么名字？”

“杰佩托。”

“那他是干什么的？”

“他是一个木雕工。”

“他赚的钱多吗？”

“他赚的钱好多，以致他口袋里从来没有一便士。请想一下，为了给我买一本上学的识字课本，他只好卖掉了身上仅有的一件上衣，那件上衣补满了补丁，真可怜啊。”

“可怜的人！我可怜他。给，拿着这五枚金币。去，把它们送给他，并带去我最亲切的问候。”

不难想象，匹诺曹向他千恩万谢，依次吻了每一个木偶，甚至还吻了那两个宪兵，然后欢天喜地开始向家里走去。

他还没走上一公里，就碰到了一只瘸狐狸和一只瞎猫。狐狸和猫像两个好朋友那样一块儿走着，狐狸倚在猫身上，瞎猫让狐狸领着路。

“早上好，匹诺曹。”狐狸很有礼貌地向他问好。

“你怎么知道我的名字？”木偶问。

“我跟你爸爸很熟。”

“你在哪儿见过他？”

“我昨天看到他站在自己的家门口。”

“那他当时在干什么？”

“他穿着衬衫，冷得发抖。”

“可怜的爸爸！可是，从今以后，要是情况允许的话，他就不再受苦了！”

“为什么？”

“因为我已经发财了。”

“你发财？”狐狸说着，开始哈哈大笑。猫也在笑，但尽力捋着长胡子掩饰住自己的笑。

“没有什么可笑的，”匹诺曹生气地叫道，“我很抱歉会让你们流口水的，可这儿，要是你们想知道的话，这儿有五枚金币。”

说着，他掏出吞火者送给他的那些金币。

听到金子欢快的叮当声，狐狸不由自主地伸出它那只瘸爪，猫也瞪大了它那两只眼睛，那两只眼睛看上去像两个燃烧的煤球，但它们很快又闭上了，所以匹诺曹没有注意到。

“那我可以问一下，”狐狸问，“你打算用这些钱干什么？”

“首先，”木偶回答说，“我想给我爸爸买一件漂亮的新上衣，一件金银做的、带有钻石纽扣的上衣，然后给我自己买一本识字课本。”

“给你自己？”

“那还用说，我想上学好好学习。”

“看看我，”狐狸说，“我就是为了想上学这个愚蠢的想法，失去了一只爪子。”

“看看我，”猫说，“为了同样愚蠢的想法，我失去了两只眼睛。”

正在这时候，一只落在路边栅栏上的画眉鸟大声叫喊，声音尖锐清晰：“匹诺曹，不要听坏朋友的话。要不，你会后悔的！”

可怜的小画眉鸟！它要是没有说该多好啊！眨眼之间，猫纵身扑向它，连毛带骨一口吃了它。

吃过画眉鸟，猫擦净胡子，闭上眼，又成了瞎子。

“可怜的画眉鸟！”匹诺曹对猫说，“你为什么要杀它？”

“我杀它是要给它一个教训，它话太多了，下次它就不会信口开河了。”

这时，他们三个结伴已经走了很长一段路了。突然，狐狸在路上停下来，转向木偶说：“你想让你的金币翻倍吗？”

“你这话是什么意思？”

“你想让你那可怜巴巴的五枚金币变成一百枚、一千枚、两千枚金币吗？”

“想，可怎么变呢？”

“方法很简单，不要回家，跟我们走。”

“那你们带我去哪儿？”

“到傻瓜城去。”

匹诺曹想了一会儿，然后坚定地说：“不，我不想去。离家不远了，我要回家，爸爸正等着我呢。我还没有回到家，他一定会非常不开心的！我是一个坏孩子，会说话的蟋蟀说得对，不听话的男孩子在这个世界上是绝不会幸福的。我从自己的代价中领会了这一点，甚至昨天晚上在戏院里，当吞火者……噢！！！！！……只要一想起来，我就浑身发抖。”

“那好吧，”狐狸说，“要是你真想回家，那就回家吧，但你会后悔的！”

“你会后悔的。”猫随声附和道。

“匹诺曹，好好想想，你是在跟幸运女神背道而驰。”

“跟幸运女神背道而驰。”猫随声附和道。

“明天你的五枚金币就会变成两千枚金币！”

“两千枚金币！”猫随声附和道。

“可是，它们怎么可能会变成那么多呢？”匹诺曹惊奇地问。

“我这就解释给你听。”狐狸说，“你一定知道，傻瓜城外有一块福地，叫‘奇迹宝地’。你在这块田地里挖一个小坑，在这个坑里埋进一枚金币。你在坑上盖上土，好好浇水，再撒上一点儿盐，然后上床睡觉。夜里，这枚金币就会发芽、生长、开花，第二天早上，你就会发现一棵长满金币的漂亮的树。”

“这么说，要是我埋进去五枚金币，”匹诺曹越来越惊奇地叫道，“第二天早上我应该发现——多少？”

“很简单就可以算出来，”狐狸回答说，“哎呀，你扳手指就可以算出来！假如一枚金币长出五百枚，就是五百乘以五，第二天早上，你就会有两千五百枚闪闪发亮的新金币。”

“好！好！”匹诺曹高兴得手舞足蹈，大声叫道，“等我拿到这些金币，我拿两千枚，另外的五百枚送给你们俩。”

“送给我们？”狐狸假装受到了侮辱，大声叫道，“哎呀，我们当然不要！”

“当然不要！”猫随声附和道。

“我们这么做可不是为了获利，”狐狸回答说，“我们这么做只是为了让别人发财！”

“为了让别人发财！”猫随声附和道。

“多好的人啊！”匹诺曹暗自想道。于是，他忘记了爸爸，忘记了新上衣，忘记了识字课本，也忘记了他所有美好的决心，对狐狸和猫说道：“我们走吧。我跟你们去。”





第十三章


红虾客栈。



猫、狐狸和木偶走啊走啊走，最后，天色黄昏，他们筋疲力尽地来到了红虾客栈。

“我们在这儿停一会儿，”狐狸说，“吃点儿东西，休息几小时，半夜再动身，因为明天天不亮我们必须赶到奇迹宝地。”

他们走进客栈，都在一张桌边坐下来。不过，他们谁都说不是很饿。

可怜的猫感觉体力不佳，只能吃三十五条番茄酱胭脂鱼和四份奶酪杂碎，而且，因为它急需要力量，所以它又要了黄油和奶酪。

花言巧语半天之后，狐狸尽力少吃一点儿。大夫要它节食，所以它只吃了一只小野兔和十二只鲜嫩的童子鸡。之后，它又点了几只山鹑、几只野鸡、两只家兔、十二只青蛙和蜥蜴。就这些。它说，它感到恶心，一口也吃不下去了。

匹诺曹吃得最少。他要了一小块面包和几个坚果，可结果都留在盘子里没吃。可怜的家伙一心只想着那个奇迹宝地，得了金币消化不良症。

吃过晚饭，狐狸对客栈老板说道：“给我们两个好房间，一间匹诺曹先生住，一间我和我的朋友住。动身前，我们要小睡一会儿。记住午夜时分叫我们，因为我们必须继续赶路。”

“是，先生。”老板答道，心照不宣地对狐狸和猫眨了眨眼，好像是说：“我明白。”

匹诺曹一上床就睡着了，开始做起了梦，他梦见自己在一块地中央。田地里满是结满葡萄的葡萄树，那些葡萄正是金币，它们随风晃动，发出了欢快的叮当声，好像是说：“谁想要我们就让他来采吧！”

正当匹诺曹伸手要去采它们时，忽然被三下响亮的敲门声惊醒了。原来是旅馆老板来告诉他，钟已经敲过午夜十二点了。

“我的朋友们准备好了吗？”木偶问他。

“的确准备好了！它们两个小时前就走了。”

“为什么这样急？”

“很不幸，猫接到电报说，它的大孩子生冻疮，快要死了。它来不及跟你告别。”

“它们付过晚饭钱了吗？”

“它们怎么可能做这种事呢？因为很荣幸你付账，所以它们很有教养，是不会如此冒犯你的。”

“真可惜！那种冒犯一定会让我高兴得不得了。”匹诺曹挠挠头说。

“我的好朋友们说过它们会在哪儿等我吗？”他又问道。

“明天早上日出时在奇迹宝地。”

匹诺曹为他们三个的晚饭付了一枚金币，就开始上路向那个会使他发财的宝地走去。

他向前走，不知道自己要去哪儿，因为天很黑，黑得什么都看不见，四周连一片树叶也不动。几只蝙蝠不时地掠过他的鼻子，把他吓得半死。他大叫了一声：“谁在那儿？”随后，远处的山冈向他发出了回声：“谁在那儿？谁在那儿？谁在那儿？”

匹诺曹正走着，看到一个小生物在一棵树干上闪着微光，是一种淡淡的柔光。

“你是谁？”他问。

“我是会说话的蟋蟀的影子。”小生物声音微弱地答道，听上去像是来自一个遥远的世界。

“你想要什么？”木偶问。

“我想给你几句忠告，回家去吧，把剩下的四枚金币送给你可怜的爸爸，他正在哭泣，因为他好多天没有见到你了。”

“我的爸爸明天就要发财了，因为这四枚金币会变成两千枚的。”

“不要听信那些许诺让你一夜发财的人，我的孩子。他们通常不是傻瓜就是骗子。听我的话，回家去吧。”

“可是，我想往前走！”

“时间很晚了！”

“我想往前走。”

“夜很黑。”

“我想往前走。”

“路上有危险。”

“我想往前走。”

“记住，一意孤行的男孩子迟早会遭难的。”

“又是那些废话。再见，蟋蟀。”

“再见，匹诺曹，愿上天保护你避开刺客。”

沉默了一会儿，会说话的蟋蟀的光突然消失了，就像有人把它吹灭了似的。道路再一次陷入了黑暗。





第十四章


匹诺曹不听会说话的蟋蟀的好言相劝，落到了刺客的手里。



“哎呀，哎呀，说真的，”木偶一边重新上路，一边自言自语，“我们男孩子确实很倒霉！人人都责骂我们，人人都给我们忠告，人人都警告我们。要是我们允许的话，人人都想给我们当爸爸妈妈，就连会说话的蟋蟀也想。就拿我来说吧，就因为我不愿听那只讨厌的蟋蟀唠叨，它就说不知道有多少不幸在等着我！还会有刺客！至少我不相信有刺客，也绝不会有。理智地说，我想刺客是爸爸妈妈想吓唬夜里想跑走的孩子而虚构的。即使我真的在路上碰到他们，那又有什么关系呢？我要跑到他们的面前，说：‘喂，先生，你们想怎么样？记住，你们不能跟我开玩笑！快走，管好你们自己的事。’说这话时，我几乎能看到那些可怜的家伙像阵风似的跑走。万一他们不跑走，我总能自己跑……”

匹诺曹没来得及把他那套大道理讲完，因为他听到身后树叶丛中响起了轻轻的飒飒声。

他回头一看，只见黑暗中站着两个高大的黑影，从头到脚裹着黑麻袋。那两个黑影跳向他，轻得就像鬼一样。

“他们真的来了！”匹诺曹自言自语。他不知道要把四枚金币藏到哪儿，就把它们藏在了舌头底下。他想逃走，但刚迈了一步，就感到胳膊被抓住了，他听到两个深沉可怕的声音对他说：“要钱还是要命？”

因为嘴里塞着金币，所以匹诺曹说不成话。于是，他尽可能地用头、双手和身体示意说，他只是一个可怜的木偶，口袋里连一便士也没有。

“嘿，嘿，少废话，把钱拿出来！”两个强盗大声威胁道。

木偶又一次用头和手表示：“我连一个便士也没有。”

“把钱拿出来，否则你就死定了。”高个子杀人强盗说。

“死定了。”另一个随声附和道。

“等杀了你，我们还要杀你的爸爸。”

“还要杀你的爸爸！”

“不，不，不，不要杀我的爸爸！”匹诺曹心惊胆战地叫道，但他尖叫时，嘴里的金币就叮叮当当响了起来。

“啊，你这坏蛋！这就是你玩的花招！原来你把钱藏在了舌头底下。把钱拿出来！”

但是，匹诺曹仍然非常顽强。

“你聋了吗？等一下，小伙子，我们眨眼工夫就会从你那儿拿走的！”

其中一个抓住匹诺曹的鼻子，另一个抓住他的下巴，然后，它们残忍地向两边拽，想让他张开嘴。

一切都无济于事，木偶的嘴唇像是被钉在了一起，怎么也打不开。

绝望之中，矮个子刺客从口袋里拔出一把长刀，想用它撬开匹诺曹的嘴巴。

匹诺曹快如闪电狠狠地咬住刺客的手，一口把它咬下来，吐了出去。设想一下，当看到那不是一只手，而是一只猫爪时，他是多么吃惊！

匹诺曹首战告捷，就一鼓作气挣脱强盗的爪子，跳过路边的矮树丛，飞快地跑过田野。那两个强盗马上向他追去，就像两条狗在追一只野兔似的。

跑了大约十公里后，匹诺曹几乎筋疲力尽。他感到自己跑不动了，就爬上一棵巨松，坐在那儿，看他可以看到的一切。那两个刺客也设法想爬上树，可是爬到一半就滑下来，掉在了地上。

它们还不死心，这只能刺激它们继续行动。它们抱来一捆木柴，堆在松树脚下，然后点着了。眨眼间，松树开始噼里啪啦燃烧，就像被风刮到的蜡烛一样。匹诺曹看到火焰越烧越高，他不想被烤熟，于是就飞快地跳到地上，又跑走了。两个杀人强盗像先前那样对他紧追不舍。

天已经开始亮了，没有任何预兆，匹诺曹突然发现一个土咖啡色的满满当当的深水池挡住了去路。

有什么办法呢？“一，二，三！”木偶叫着，一下子跳了过去。两个刺客也跟着跳，但它们没有算准距离——扑通！！！——它们俩都直接掉进了池子里。匹诺曹听到扑通一声，也感觉到了，哈哈大笑，但绝没有停止奔跑：“祝你们痛痛快快洗个澡，先生们！”

他想它们肯定淹死了，可回头一看，只见那两个黑影还在后面追他，尽管它们的黑麻袋已经湿透了，在滴滴答答滴着水。





第十五章


刺客们追逐匹诺曹，抓住了他，把他吊在一棵大橡树的树枝上。



木偶一边跑，一边越来越确信他肯定得落到那两个刺客的手里了。突然，他看到森林里有一座雪白的小房子在隐约闪现。

“我要是有足够的力气跑到那座小房子那里，就可能有救了。”他自言自语道。

他一刻不停飞快地跑过了森林。两个刺客依然在后面追。他拼命跑了差不多一个小时后，疲惫不堪，气喘吁吁，终于来到了那个小屋门口，连忙敲起了门。可是没有人开门。

他又敲了敲门，比先前敲得更猛了，因为他听到身后传来了刺客的脚步声和吃力的喘息声。可小屋的门还是悄无声息。

因为敲门毫无用处，无奈之际，匹诺曹开始踢门撞门，要把门砸开。这时一扇窗户打开了，一位美丽的少女探出头来，她天蓝色的头发，脸白似蜡，眼睛闭合，双手交叉放在胸前。她用几乎听不见的声音说道：“没有人在这座房子里住，所有的人都死了。”

“你至少给我开开门，好吗？”匹诺曹用哀求的声音哭道。

“我也死了。”

“死了？那你现在在窗口干什么？”

“我在等棺材把我运走。”

说完这些话，小女孩就不见了踪影。窗户也无声地关上了。

“噢，天蓝色头发的可爱少女，”匹诺曹喊道，“开开门吧，我求你了，可怜可怜一个可怜的男孩子吧，他正被两个刺——”

他没有说完，因为两只有力的手抓住了他的脖子，还听到那两个可怕的声音威胁着吼道：“现在我们抓住你了！”

木偶看到死神在他眼前跳舞，禁不住浑身颤抖，腿关节咔嗒作响，金币在舌头底下叮叮当当响起来了。

“好了，”两个刺客问，“你现在开不开口？啊！你不回答？很好，这次你一定会张口的。”

它们拔出两把像剃刀一样锋利的长刀，在木偶的背上狠狠地砍了两下。

幸亏，木偶是用很硬的木头做的，刀断成了好多片。两个刺客手里握着刀柄，沮丧地面面相觑。

“我明白了，”其中一个对另一个说，“现在只有吊死他。”

“吊死他。”另一个随声附和道。

它们把匹诺曹的双手反绑到肩后，在他的脖子上套了个绳索，将绳索抛到一棵大橡树的大高枝上，然后拉动绳索，直到可怜的木偶被高高地吊到了空中。

它们对自己的做法感到满意，就坐在草地上，等着匹诺曹断气。但是，过了三个小时后，木偶的眼睛还睁着，嘴巴还闭着，两腿比先前踢得更猛了。

两个刺客等得不耐烦了，就取笑他道：“明天见，等明天早上回到这儿时，我们希望你会礼貌地让我们发现你张着大嘴死去。”说完，它们就扬长而去。

过了几分钟之后，一阵狂风开始刮了起来。呼啸呜咽的大风把可怜的小匹诺曹吹得像钟摆一样摆来摆去。这样摇啊摇，摇得他像晕了船一样痛苦。绳索越收越紧，让他喘不过气来。渐渐地，一层薄雾蒙上了他的眼睛。

死神越爬越近了，木偶仍然希望有一个好人过来救他，但一个人也没有出现。正当他准备送命时，他又想起了可怜的老爸爸，就喃喃自语，几乎没有意识到自己在说话：“噢，爸爸，亲爱的爸爸！你要是在这儿多好啊！”

这是他最后说的话。他合上眼，张开嘴，伸展两腿，吊在那儿，好像已经死了。





第十六章


天蓝色头发的可爱少女派人放下可怜的木偶，把他放到床上，并请三位医生告诉她匹诺曹是死是活。



要是可怜的匹诺曹吊在那儿更久的话，一切希望就会全部丧失。对他来说，幸运的是，天蓝色头发的可爱少女又一次从窗口探出头来，她看到可怜的小家伙被风刮得摇来晃去，太不幸了，不禁动了恻隐之心，于是拍了三下手。

这三下手掌一拍，就传来了响亮的拍翅膀的声音，一只大猎鹰飞过来，落在了窗台上。

“你有什么命令啊，迷人的仙女？”猎鹰问，弯下鸟嘴深深地致敬（因为要知道，蓝色头发的少女不是别人，正是非常善良的仙女，她在这树林附近已经住了一千多年了）。

“你看到在大橡树枝上吊着的那个木偶了吗？”

“我看到他了。”

“很好。马上飞到他那儿，用你有力的嘴啄开那个捆着他的绳套，把他救下来，然后轻轻地放在橡树脚下的草地上。”

猎鹰飞走了，两分钟后回来说道：“我已经按照你的命令做好了。”

“你觉得他怎么样？是活着还是死了？”

“乍一看，我还以为他死了呢。可是，稍后我发现自己错了，因为我一解开他脖子上的绳套，他就长叹了一口气，有气无力地咕哝道：‘现在我感觉好些了！’”

仙女又拍了两下手，一条出色的狮子狗走过来，它像人那样用后腿直立行走。它身穿宫廷制服，金边三角帽呈潇洒的角度，戴在垂到腰际的白色假卷发上。它穿着巧克力色天鹅绒漂亮上衣，衣服上缀有钻石纽扣，还带有两只大口袋，口袋里装满了骨头，骨头是它可爱的女主人用餐时丢在那儿的。它下身穿着深红色天鹅绒马裤、一双丝袜、一双低帮银扣软鞋。它的尾巴装在一个蓝绸套里，这样，下雨的时候就不会被淋到。

“过来，梅多罗！”仙女对它说，“驾着我最好的马车，到森林里去。到了大橡树下，你会发现那个可怜巴巴、半死不活的木偶正直挺挺地躺在草地上。你把他温柔地抱起来，放在马车的丝绸坐垫上，然后送到我这儿来。你明白了吗？”

狮子狗摇了两三次丝绸套尾巴，表示听明白了，然后就快步出发了。

不一会儿，一辆里面像生奶油和巧克力布丁一样柔软、外面装饰着金丝雀羽毛、玻璃做的漂亮小马车就驶出了马厩。马车由一百对白鼠拉着，狮子狗坐在车夫座上，像真正的车夫那样在空中欢快地甩着鞭子，匆匆赶到目的地。

不到一刻钟，马车就回来了。等在门口的仙女把可怜的小木偶抱进怀里，将他抱进一个镶嵌着珍珠的漂亮房间，放在床上，然后马上派人请附近最有名的大夫到她这儿来。

三位大夫马上接二连三都来了，一个是乌鸦，一个是猫头鹰，还有一个是会说话的蟋蟀。

“先生们，我想知道，”仙女转向围在匹诺曹床边的三位大夫说，“我想知道，这可怜的木偶是死了还是活着？”

听了仙女的请求，乌鸦走上前给匹诺曹号脉，接着摸他的鼻子和小脚趾。之后，它严肃地这样说道：

“在我看来，这个木偶死了好久了，可是，万一他没死，那就有可靠的迹象表明他还活着！”

“对不起，”猫头鹰说，“我的看法跟我这位有名的朋友和同行乌鸦正好相反。在我看来，这个木偶活着，可是，万一他没有活着，那就有可靠的迹象表明他的确死了！”

“那你有什么看法？”仙女问会说话的蟋蟀。

“我要说的是，一名明智的医生在他不知道该说什么时，最好应该闭嘴。不过，那个木偶对我来说并不陌生，我认识他已经很长时间了！”

本来躺着不动的匹诺曹这会儿浑身哆嗦，弄得整个床都摇动了起来。

“那个木偶，”会说话的蟋蟀接着说道，“是个最坏的坏蛋。”

匹诺曹睁开眼睛，然后又闭上了。

“他粗鲁懒惰，还离家出走。”

匹诺曹把脸藏到了被单下面。

“那个木偶是一个不听话的孩子，他伤透了他爸爸的心！”

这时，传来了长时间颤抖的啜泣、叫喊和深深的叹息声。想一下，他们掀起被单发现匹诺曹以泪洗面，是多么吃惊啊！

“死人会哭，表明他起死回生了。”乌鸦严肃地说。

“非常抱歉，我跟这位好朋友和同行的意见刚好相反，”猫头鹰说，“在我看来，死人会哭，表明他不想死。”





第十七章


匹诺曹吃了糖，但不愿吃药。当掘墓人过来带他走时，他喝了药，感觉好了些。之后，他撒了个谎，作为惩罚，他的鼻子长得越来越长。



三位医生一离开屋子，仙女就来到匹诺曹的床边，摸摸他的额头，发现他正在发高烧。

她端来一杯水，把一点点白色粉末放进杯子里，然后递给木偶，并亲切地对他说道：“喝了这个，过几天你就会好起来的。”

匹诺曹看着杯子，做了个鬼脸，带着哭声问道：“是甜的还是苦的？”

“是苦的，但对你有好处。”

“苦的我不想喝。”

“喝了吧！”

“我不喜欢任何苦的东西。”

“喝了它，我就给你一块糖，去掉你嘴里的苦味。”

“糖在哪儿？”

“在这儿。”仙女从一只金糖碗里拿了一块糖说。

“我要先吃糖，然后再喝这苦水。”

“你答应了？”

“答应了。”

仙女把那块糖给了匹诺曹，匹诺曹眨眼间就把它嚼碎咽了，之后咂了咂嘴说：“糖要是药就好了！那我会天天吃的。”

“现在要说话算数，喝了这几滴水，它们对你有好处。”

匹诺曹两手握住杯子，鼻子伸进杯子里。他把杯子举到嘴边，又一次把鼻子伸进杯子里。

“这太苦了！真是太苦了！我喝不了。”

“你还没有尝，怎么就知道苦呢？”

“我可以想象！我闻到了气味。我想再要一块糖，然后就喝。”

仙女像一位慈爱的母亲那样耐心，又给了他一块糖，然后再次把杯子递给他。

“我不能这样喝。”木偶又做了个鬼脸说。

“为什么？”

“因为我脚上的羽毛枕头碍着我。”

仙女拿开了枕头。

“一点儿用也没有。我现在还是喝不了。”

“又怎么了？”

“我不喜欢那门现在的样子，它半开着。”

仙女关上了门。

“我不愿意喝，”匹诺曹放声大哭道，“我不喝这可怕的水。我不愿意喝，我不愿意喝！不喝，不喝，不喝，不喝！”

“我的孩子，你会后悔的。”

“我不在乎。”

“你病得很重。”

“我不在乎。”

“你发高烧，几个小时就会死的。”

“我不在乎。”

“难道你不怕死？”

“一点儿也不怕。我宁愿死，也不喝那种可怕的药。”

正在此时，房门突然开了，进来了四只黑得像墨汁一样的兔子，他们肩上抬着一口小黑棺材。

“你们想干什么？”匹诺曹问道。

“我们是来抬你走的。”最大的一只兔子说。

“抬我走？可我还没死啊！”

“是的，还没死，可是，因为你不愿喝让你好转的药，所以过一会儿你就会死的。”

“噢，仙女，我的仙女，”木偶大声叫道，“快把那杯子给我！请快点儿！我不想死！不，不，还不想——还不想！”

说完，他用两只手举着杯子，一口就把药水咽了下去。

“好吧，”四只兔子说，“这次我们白跑了一趟。”

随后，它们转过身，神情严肃地抬起小黑棺材，走出了屋子，从牙缝里咕咕哝哝说着什么。

眨眼间，匹诺曹就好了，他一下子从床上跳下来。

仙女看到他满屋子又跑又跳，快乐得像一只展翅飞翔的小鸟，就对他说：“瞧，我的药水终究对你有好处，不是吗？”

“确实有好处！它给了我新的生命。”

“那为什么我刚才让你喝，必须得那样费劲求你呢？”

“我是男孩子，你应该知道，所有的男孩子讨厌喝药胜于讨厌生病。”

“真没羞！男孩子应该知道，及时吃药能让他们免除好多痛苦，甚至能救他们的命。”

“下次你就不用那样费劲求我了！我会记住那些肩扛黑棺材的黑兔子的，我会拿住杯子和药——喝下去的！”

“现在过来这儿，告诉我，你是怎么落到了那些刺客的手里的。”

“噢，是这么回事，吞火者给了我五枚金币，送给我的爸爸，但在路上，我碰到了一只狐狸和一只猫，它们问我：‘你想让这五枚金币变成两千枚吗？’我说：‘想。’它们说：‘跟我们到奇迹宝地来吧。’我说：‘我们走吧。’随后，它们说：‘我们在红虾客栈住宿吃饭，半夜后再动身。’我们吃过饭就睡了。等我醒来时，它们已经走了，我独自摸黑动身。在路上，我碰到了两个刺客，它们身穿黑麻袋，对我说：‘是要钱还是要命！’我说：‘我没钱。’因为，你知道，我已经把钱藏在了舌头底下。一个刺客想把手伸进我的嘴里，我一口咬掉了它的手，吐了出来。可那不是一只手，而是一只猫爪子。随后，它们就追我。我跑啊跑，最后，它们抓住了我，用绳子套住我的脖子，把我吊在一棵树上，说道：‘明天我们再来收拾你。到那时，你就会死去，张开嘴巴。那样，我们就会得到你藏在舌头底下的那些金币了。’”

“那些金币现在在哪儿？”仙女问。

“我已经丢了。”匹诺曹回答说，但他撒了谎，因为他把钱放在了自己的口袋里。

他说谎时，本来就长的鼻子至少又长了五厘米。

“那你是在哪儿丢的？”

“在附近的树林里。”

他说第二句谎话时，鼻子又长了几厘米。

“要是你在附近树林里丢了的话，”仙女说，“我们去找，肯定会找到的，因为丢失在那儿的所有东西总能找到。”

“啊，现在我想起来了，”木偶回答说，心里越来越慌乱了，“我没有丢失那些金币，我刚才喝药时把它们吞进了肚子里。”

说第三句谎话时，他的鼻子比先前更长了，长得他都转不过头来了。要是向右转，他就会碰到床上或窗玻璃上；要是向左转，他就会碰到墙上或门上；要是他稍微抬起鼻子，就有弄瞎仙女的眼睛的危险。

仙女坐在那儿看着他，放声笑了起来。

“你为什么笑？”木偶问她。看到自己的鼻子越来越长，他现在心神不定。

“我在笑你撒谎。”

“你怎么知道我在撒谎？”

“我的孩子，谎话一下子就可以看出来，因为说了谎话会有两种变化：一种是腿变短，一种是鼻子变长。你刚才正好是鼻子变长。”

匹诺曹羞得无地自容，想逃出房间，但他的鼻子很长，他连门都出不去了。





第十八章


匹诺曹又发现了狐狸和猫，并跟它们一起到奇迹宝地种金币。



木偶哭得伤心欲绝，为他的长鼻子伤心了好几个小时。无论他怎么努力，就是出不去门。仙女没有对他表示任何的同情，因为她想好好给他一个教训，这样他就不会撒谎了。撒谎是男孩子学到的最坏的习惯。而当看到木偶因为害怕而脸色苍白，恐惧得眼睛快要从脑袋里暴出来时，她开始可怜起了他，于是就拍起了手。

一千只啄木鸟飞进窗户，落在匹诺曹的鼻子上。它们对着那个大鼻子狠狠地啄啊啄，不一会儿，这个鼻子的大小就像以前一样了。

“你真好啊，我的仙女，”木偶擦干眼泪说，“我是多么爱你啊！”

“我也爱你，”仙女回答说，“你要是想留在我这儿，就可以做我的小弟弟，我做你的好姐姐。”

“我很想留在这儿，可是，我可怜的爸爸怎么办啊？”

“我都想到了，我已经派人去请你的爸爸了，天黑前他就会来到这儿。”

“真的？”匹诺曹高兴地叫道，“那么，我的好仙女，要是你愿意，我想去接他。我迫不及待地想亲吻那位亲爱的老人，因为他为我吃了好多苦。”

“当然可以，你去吧，小心可别迷路了，走那条林间小路，你肯定会碰到他的。”

匹诺曹出发了。他一走进树林，就像小鹿一样跑了起来。他跑到大橡树那儿时，停住了脚步，因为他听到了灌木丛中有飒飒声。他猜得没错，只见狐狸和猫站在那儿，就是他曾在红虾客栈一起吃过晚饭的旅伴。

“我们的好朋友匹诺曹来了！”狐狸叫道，对他又抱又亲，“你怎么在这儿？”

“你怎么在这儿？”猫随声附和道。

“说来话长，”木偶说，“让我给你们讲一下吧。前几天夜里，你们把我一个人留在客栈时，我在路上碰见了那些刺客——”

“刺客？噢，我可怜的朋友！它们想要什么？”

“它们想要我的金币。”

“坏蛋！”狐狸说。

“坏得不能再坏了！”猫补充道。

“可是，我撒腿就跑，”木偶接着说道，“随后，它们就追我。最后，它们追上了我，把我吊在了那棵大橡树的树枝上。”

匹诺曹指了指附近的那棵大橡树。

“还有比这更坏的吗？”狐狸说，“我们是生活在一个多么可怕的世界啊！我们在哪儿可以为我们这些绅士找到一个安全的地方呢？”

狐狸这样说着，匹诺曹注意到猫的右爪子缠着绷带。

“你的爪子怎么了？”他问道。

猫想设法回答，却又结结巴巴、语无伦次，所以狐狸帮它解了围。

“我的朋友太谦虚了，不愿回答，我来替它回答吧。大约一小时前，我们在路上碰到了一条老狼，它已经饿得半死，请求我们帮忙。我们没有什么可以给它，你猜我的朋友出于善心做了什么？它用牙齿咬掉了一只前爪，扔给了那条可怜的野兽吃，这样它才可能有东西吃啊。”

狐狸一边说着，一边抹去了一滴眼泪。

匹诺曹也感动得差点儿流泪，对着猫耳朵低声说道：“要是所有的猫都像你一样，那些老鼠就会多么幸运啊！”

“那你在这儿干什么？”狐狸问木偶。

“我在等我的爸爸，他现在随时都会到这儿来。”

“那你的金币呢？”

“除了在红虾客栈花掉的那枚金币，剩下的都还在我的口袋里装着呢。”

“想想那四枚金币明天就能变两千枚金币吧。你为什么不听我的话？你为什么不把它们种到奇迹宝地里呢？”

“今天不行，我改天跟你们去。”

“改天就太晚了。”狐狸说。

“为什么？”

“因为那块地已经被一位大富翁买去了，今天是最后一天对外开放了。”

“这个奇迹宝地有多远啊？”

“只有三公里。你愿意跟我们去吗？我们不到半小时就到了。你可以马上种下那些钱，几分钟后，你就可以收到两千枚金币，回家就富了。你要去吗？”

回答之前，匹诺曹犹豫了一会儿，因为他想起了善良的仙女，想起了老杰佩托，还想起了会说话的蟋蟀的忠告。于是，他最后像没有心眼、没有脑子的男孩子们做的那样，耸了耸肩，对狐狸和猫说：“我们走吧！我跟你们去。”

于是，他们就去了。

他们走啊走，至少走了半天，最后来到了一个叫“傻瓜城”的地方。他们一进城，匹诺曹就注意到满街都是饿得打哈欠的无毛狗，冷得发抖的剪毛绵羊，乞讨一粒麦子的无冠鸡，不能使用翅膀的大蝴蝶，因为它们卖掉了所有漂亮的颜色，还有没有尾巴、羞于见人的孔雀，以及全身污泥、急忙跑走、痛惜永失闪亮的金银色羽毛的野鸡。

在这个贫民和乞丐群中间，不时地穿过一辆漂亮的马车，马车里坐的不是狐狸、鹰，就是秃鹫。

“奇迹宝地在哪儿？”匹诺曹问，渐渐地走得不耐烦了。

“要耐心。只有几步远了。”

他们穿过城，出了城门，就走进了一块人迹罕至的田地。这块田地跟其他所有的田地完全没什么两样。

“我们到了，”狐狸对木偶说，“在这儿挖一个坑，然后把金币放进去。”

木偶言听计从，挖了一个坑，把四枚金币放进去，然后小心翼翼地用土盖好。

“现在，”狐狸说，“到附近那条小溪边打一桶水，洒在这个地方。”

匹诺曹紧跟到小溪边，但是，因为没有桶，所以他就脱下一只鞋，装满水，洒在埋着金币的土上。随后，他问道：“还有什么事吗？”

“没有别的事了，”狐狸回答说，“现在我们可以走了。二十分钟后回到这儿，你就会发现这儿长起了葡萄藤，藤条上挂满了金币。”

木偶高兴得忘乎所以，对狐狸和猫千恩万谢，还答应送给它们每人一件漂亮礼物。

“我们不要你任何礼物，”两个坏蛋回答说，“能帮助你不用费多少劲或根本不用费劲就能发财，对我们来说足够了。为此我们会像国王一样开心。”

它们告别匹诺曹，并祝他好运，就干自己的事去了。





第十九章


匹诺曹被抢走了金币，作为惩罚，他被判处四个月有期徒刑。



要是告诉木偶要等一天而不是二十分钟，时间好像对他来说可能就不那么难过了。他急切地走来走去，最后将鼻子转向奇迹宝地。

他步履匆匆，心像挂钟一样嘀嗒嘀嗒兴奋地跳动，脑海里一直在忙着思考：“要是我发现树上不是一千枚金币，而是两千枚，那会怎样呢？要是我发现树上不是两千枚，而是五千枚——或十万枚呢？我要建一座美丽的宫殿，还有一千个马厩，有一千匹木马跟我玩耍，地下室里面放满柠檬水和冰激凌苏打，还要有一间图书室，里面摆满糖果、水果、蛋糕和饼干。”

他这样自得其乐地幻想着，来到了那块田地。他在那儿停下来，看看是否碰巧见到一棵结满金币的葡萄藤。但是，他什么也没有看到！他又向前走了几步，还是什么也没有！他走进那块田地，来到他挖坑埋金币的那个地方，又是一无所有！匹诺曹苦思冥想，完全忘记了礼貌规矩，从口袋里掏出一只手来，挠了半天头。

正在这时，他听到自己的头边突然传来了大笑声，他急忙转过身，只见他正上方的一根树枝上卧着一只正在忙着梳理羽毛的大鹦鹉。

“你在笑什么啊？”匹诺曹恼怒地问道。

“我之所以大笑，是因为我梳理羽毛时，弄痒了翅膀下面的胳肢窝。”

木偶没有答话，他走到小溪边，往一只鞋里灌满水，然后又在覆盖金币的地面洒了洒水。

这时，寂静的田野里又传来了一阵大笑声，这一次笑得甚至比第一次更加粗鲁无礼。

“好了，”匹诺曹这次生气地叫道，“鹦鹉先生，我可以知道，是什么让你这样好笑吗？”

“我在笑那些傻瓜，他们听到什么都相信，那么容易就落入了别人为他们设置的圈套。”

“你大概是在说我吧？”

“我当然是说你了，可怜的匹诺曹——你真是一个小傻瓜，居然相信金币可以像豆子或南瓜那样种在田地里。我也曾相信过一次，今天为此感到后悔。今天（可是，太晚了！）我已经得出了结论，为了老老实实地挣到钱，人必须劳动，并懂得怎样用脑。”

“我不知道你在说什么。”木偶说，因害怕而开始颤抖。

“真可惜！我会解释得更清楚的。”鹦鹉说，“你离开这里到城里去时，狐狸和猫匆匆回到这儿，挖走了你埋的四枚金币，像阵风似的跑掉了。要是你能抓住它们，那你就是英雄！”

匹诺曹张大嘴。他不相信鹦鹉的话，开始拼命地挖浇过水的土。他挖啊挖，直到挖的坑跟他自己一样大，可那儿还是没有钱。一枚金币都没有。

木偶绝望了，他跑到城里，直接上法院向法官告发这桩盗窃案。法官是一只大猩猩，一只德高望重的大猩猩，它的飘飘白胡盖住了胸部。它戴着一副金丝边眼镜，玻璃片已经掉了出来。它说，它之所以戴眼镜，是因为多年工作眼睛已经弱视了。

匹诺曹站在法官面前，一五一十地讲了这个可怜的故事，并提供了两名强盗的姓名和特征，请求对它们绳之以法。

法官非常耐心地听着，眼里闪现出和蔼的神情。它对这个故事很感兴趣，颇受感动，还差点儿掉下泪来。等木偶不再说时，法官伸出一只手，摇了摇铃。

听到铃声，来了两条穿着宪兵制服的大猛犬。

随后，法官指着匹诺曹，非常严肃地说：“这个可怜的笨蛋被人抢走了四枚金币，所以，把他抓起来，投进牢房。”木偶听到这样的宣判，完全呆住了。他想提出抗议，但两个宪兵用爪子堵住了他的嘴，猛推着他去了牢房。

木偶不得不在牢里待了又长又累的四个月。要不是发生一件非常巧合的事，说不定他还得在那儿待下去。亲爱的孩子们，事情是这样的，原来统治傻瓜城的年轻皇帝刚刚打了个大胜仗，因此下令普天同庆，张灯结彩，燃放烟火，进行各种演出，最棒的是，为了表示欢庆，打开了所有牢房的大门。

“别人出去，我也必须出去。”匹诺曹对狱卒说。

“你不能出去，”狱卒回答说，“你不属于这一类——”

“对不起，”匹诺曹打断说，“我也是一个小偷。”

“那样的话，你也自由了。”说着，狱卒脱下帽子，深鞠一躬，打开了牢门。匹诺曹跑出牢门，头也没回就跑远了。





第二十章


从牢里释放后，匹诺曹打算回到仙女家里；但是，在路上，他碰见了一条毒蛇，后来又被捕兽夹夹住了。



设想一下，匹诺曹发现自己获得自由时开心的情景！他二话没说，马上从城里逃出来，踏上了返回可爱仙女那座小屋去的路。

雨下了好多天，路上泥泞不堪，匹诺曹走起来有时差不多半条腿都会陷到烂泥里。

但是，他勇敢前行。

他备受折磨，渴望再见到他的爸爸和天蓝色头发的仙女姐姐，就像猎犬一样飞跑起来。他跑起来时，泥点儿甚至都飞溅到了帽子上。

“我曾是多么不幸啊！”他自言自语道，“不过，这都是我自作自受，因为我确实非常固执和愚蠢！我总是一意孤行，不愿意听那些爱我、比我有头脑的人的话。而从现在起，我决心改邪归正，努力成为一个非常听话的男孩子。如今我已经明白了，不管怎样，毫无疑问，不听话的男孩子绝不会幸福，而且从长远来看，他们总是一败涂地。我不知道爸爸是不是在等我，我会在仙女家里见到他吗？可怜的人，我已经好久没有见到他了，我真想得到他的爱和亲吻。仙女会原谅我的所作所为吗？她对我曾是那么好，我一生都要感激她！还有比我更坏更狠心的男孩子吗？”

正说着，他突然停下来，吓得浑身冰冷。

怎么回事？原来是一条大毒蛇横躺在路上。这条蛇有着鲜绿色的皮肤，闪亮火红的眼睛，尖尖的尾巴像烟囱一样冒着烟。

可怜的匹诺曹是多么害怕啊！他拼命向后跑了一公里，最后坐在一堆石头上，等这条蛇爬走，把路给它让出来。

他等了一小时、两小时、三小时，但那条蛇还在那儿。就是从远处，也能看到那双红红的眼睛和又长又尖的尾巴上冒出的烟柱。

匹诺曹尽力表现得非常勇敢，走到那条蛇身边，用甜甜的、细细的声音说道：“对不起，蛇先生，你行行好，走到一边让我过去，好吗？”

可结果是他还不如对一堵墙说话，蛇就是一声不吭。

他又用同样甜美的声音说：“蛇先生，你一定知道，我要回家去，因为我的爸爸在那儿等着我。我已经好久没有见到他了！我过去，你会介意吗？”

他等着那条蛇对他的问题做出某种回应，但蛇还是没有回应。相反，此前清醒、充满生机的绿蛇突然一动不动，闭上了眼睛，尾巴也不再冒烟了。

“我想知道，它死了吗？”匹诺曹高兴地搓着手说。他毫不犹豫，就要从蛇身上跨过去，但他刚抬起一条腿，蛇突然像弹簧一样弹了起来。木偶大吃一惊，仰面倒下，笨手笨脚地跌倒，头插在泥淖里，两腿朝天，倒竖在那儿。

看到木偶像一阵小旋风似的踢来扭去，毒蛇哈哈大笑了好长时间，最后笑破了一根动脉，当场就一命呜呼了。

匹诺曹从尴尬境地摆脱出来，又开始跑了起来，好在天黑前赶到仙女家。他跑啊跑，饥饿感越来越强了。最后他再也忍不住了，就跳进了一块葡萄地，想摘几串让他心动的葡萄吃。唉，他还真是倒霉啊！

他走到葡萄藤下面时——咔嚓一声！——两条腿被夹住了。

可怜的木偶被一个农夫放在那儿逮黄鼠狼的捕兽夹夹住了，因为黄鼠狼每天夜里都来偷这个农夫的鸡。





第二十一章


匹诺曹被一个农夫抓住了。这个农夫让他看鸡圈。



你完全可以想象，匹诺曹开始尖叫哭泣，苦苦求饶，但一点儿用也没有，因为这儿周围既不见房子，也不见路上有一个人走过。

夜幕降临。

一方面是因为他的两条腿被夹得疼痛难忍，一方面是因为他发现自己孤零零地待在黑乎乎的田地里而感到害怕，木偶眼看就要昏过去，这时他突然看到一只小小的萤火虫飞过，便朝萤火虫喊道：“噢，亲爱的小萤火虫，你放了我好吗？”

“可怜的小家伙！”萤火虫答道，它停下来，同情地看着匹诺曹，“你是怎么被夹在这捕兽夹里的呀？”

“我走进这块地里，想摘几串葡萄——”

“这些葡萄是你的吗？”

“不是。”

“是谁教你拿不属于自己的东西的啊？”

“我很饿。”

“我的孩子，饿不是你拿别人东西的理由。”

“这话没错，这话没错！”匹诺曹含泪哭道，“我再也不这样做了。”

正在这时，他们的谈话被渐渐走近的脚步声打断了。来的是这块地的主人，他踮起脚尖走来，想看看他是不是碰巧夹住了夜里一直吃他的鸡的那些黄鼠狼。

他举起灯笼，非常吃惊地看到夹住的不是一只黄鼠狼，而是一个小男孩！

“啊，你这小偷！”农夫生气地说，“这么说，我的鸡是你偷走的呀！”

“我没有偷！不，不是！”匹诺曹大声痛哭道，“我来这儿只是想摘几串葡萄。”

“会偷葡萄的人可能也会偷鸡。相信我的话，我来教训你一顿，叫你一辈子也忘不了。”

他打开捕兽夹，一把抓住木偶的衣领，像拎一只小狗似的把他拎回了家。走到房前的院子里时，他把木偶扔在地上，一只脚踩在他的脖子上，对他粗暴地说道：“现在天晚了，到上床睡觉的时候了，明天我们再算账。在此期间，因为我的看门狗梅兰珀今天死了，所以你就来代替它看守我的鸡舍吧。”

说到做到，他在匹诺曹的脖子上套上狗脖套。他收紧狗脖套，以免脱落。狗脖套上系着一根长铁链，铁链的另一头钉在墙上。

“要是今天晚上碰巧下雨，”农夫说，“你可以到附近那个小狗窝里去睡觉，那儿有好多稻草，可以作为软床。那曾是梅兰珀睡了三年的床，这对你够好的了。万一有小偷来，记住要竖起耳朵听着，汪汪地叫。”

这样吩咐完后，农夫就走进屋里，关上门，并插上了门闩。

可怜的匹诺曹蜷缩在狗窝旁边，饥寒交迫，胆战心惊，生不如死。他时不时地拉拽狗脖套，狗脖套快把他给勒死了，他有气无力地叫道：“我这是自作自受！是的，我这是自作自受！我是一个懒人和浪子，我从来不听从任何人的劝告，总是随心所欲。要是我像其他许多的男孩子那样学习和劳动，跟可怜的爸爸待在一起，那我现在就不会在这田野里，在这黑暗中，给一个农夫当看门狗了。噢，要是我能一切重来，该多好啊！#可是，覆水难收，我必须忍耐！”

匹诺曹这样对自己小小说教了一番，这是从他的内心深处发出来的，之后他走进狗窝，倒头睡去。





第二十二章


匹诺曹发现了强盗；作为对他的忠诚的一种奖赏，他又获得了自由。



即使男孩子可能会不开心，他们也很少会为自己的烦恼辗转反侧。木偶也不例外。平静地睡了几个小时后，直到半夜时分，他被院子里传来的莫名其妙的低语和鬼鬼祟祟的声音惊醒了。他把鼻子伸到狗窝外面，看到四只细长多毛、像猫一样的动物。它们是黄鼠狼，是一种非常喜欢吃鸡蛋和小鸡的小动物。一只黄鼠狼离开同伴，走到狗窝门边，声音甜美地说道：“晚上好，梅兰珀。”

“我不叫梅兰珀。”木偶回答说。

“那你是谁？”

“我是匹诺曹。”

“你在这儿干什么？”

“我是看门狗。”

“可是，梅兰珀在哪儿？过去住在这屋子里的那条老狗在哪儿？”

“它今天早上死了。”

“死了？可怜的畜生！它非常好！不过，看你的脸，我觉得你也是一条和善的狗。”

“对不起，我不是狗！”

“那你是什么？”

“我是一个木偶。”

“你是要当看门狗吗？”

“我遗憾地说就是，我是在受惩罚。”

“好，我要和你达成跟死去的梅兰珀达成过的同样的协议，我相信你听到会非常高兴。”

“是什么协议？”

“我们的计划是这样的：我们像过去一样偶尔来拜访这个鸡舍，然后带走八只小鸡。其中，七只是给我们的，一只是给你的，当然，条件是你要假装睡觉，不要叫醒那个农夫。”

“梅兰珀真是这样干的吗？”匹诺曹问。

“它真是这样干的。正因为这样，我们才成了最好的朋友。安安静静地睡觉去吧，记住，我们走前，会给你留下一只漂亮的肥鸡，为你明天的早饭做好准备。你明白了吗？”

“再明白不过了。”匹诺曹答道，然后以威胁的方式摇了摇头，好像是说：“我们走着瞧吧，我的朋友们。”

四只黄鼠狼一讨论完，就直接走到狗窝旁边的鸡舍，用尖齿和利爪扒开小门，溜了进去。但是，它们刚进去，就听见门咣当一声猛地关上了。

把门关上的是匹诺曹。他关上门还不算，又拖了一块大石头放在门前。接着，开始叫了起来，叫得就像一条真正的看门狗：“汪，汪，汪！汪，汪！”

听到响亮的汪汪声，农夫跳下床，拿起枪，跃上窗户，大声问道：“怎么了？”

“小偷来了！”匹诺曹答道。

“它们在哪儿？”

“在鸡舍里。”

“我马上下来。”

真的，农夫转眼就来到了院子里，向鸡舍跑去。他打开门，把黄鼠狼一只只拽出来，绑起来塞进袋子后，高兴地对它们说：“你们终于落到了我的手里！我本来可以现在就惩罚你们，但我要等一下！明天上午你们说不定要跟我去小饭店，在那儿你们会成为某个饥饿人的美餐。这对你们来说的确是极大的荣光，你们本来不应该得到这份荣光，但你们明白，我的确是一个非常善良、宽宏大量的人，我要做给你们看！”

随后，他走到匹诺曹身边，开始拥抱爱抚他。

“你是怎么这么快就发现它们的？试想一下，梅兰珀，我忠实的梅兰珀，这些年从来没有发现它们！”

木偶本来可以当场把他知道的狗和黄鼠狼之间的可耻协议说出来，但想到狗已经死了，就自言自语道：“梅兰珀已经死了，谴责它有什么用呢？死者已去，无法为自己辩护了。我们要做的最好的事儿就是让它安宁！”

“黄鼠狼来时，你是醒着还是睡了？”农夫接着问道。

“我睡了，”匹诺曹回答说，“可是，它们的低语声吵醒了我。其中一只甚至走到狗窝边，对我说道：‘要是你答应不叫，我们就送给你一只鸡作为你的早饭。’你听到了吗？它们居然厚颜无耻地对我提出这种建议！因为你一定知道，尽管我是一个一无是处、非常淘气的木偶，但我从来没有，也绝不会贪污受贿。”

“好孩子！”农夫友好地拍着他的肩膀，大声说道：“你应该为自己感到自豪。为了表明我对你的看法，你从此刻起就自由了！”

说着，农夫给他解下了狗脖套。





第二十三章


得知可爱的天蓝色头发仙女去世，匹诺曹失声痛哭。他遇见了一只鸽子，鸽子驮着他飞到了海边。他扑进海里，去救自己的父亲。



匹诺曹一觉得脖子上那个丢脸的狗脖套没有了，就撒腿跑过田野和草地，一分钟也不停，一直跑到了那条把他带向仙女家的大路。

到了大路上，他定睛望着下方的山谷。他就是在那儿看到了树林，在树林里不幸碰见了狐狸和猫，还有他被吊起来的那棵大橡树。但是，他四处寻找，就是看不到天蓝色头发的仙女住的那座小房子。

他胆战心惊，拔腿飞奔，最后跑到了小房子曾耸立的那个地方。小房子已经不在那儿，取而代之的是一小块大理石碑，石碑上刻着这样令人伤心的碑文：

这儿躺着

天蓝色头发的美丽仙女

她因被弟弟匹诺曹

遗弃

悲伤而死

读完这些碑文，可怜的木偶伤心欲绝，倒在地上，一遍又一遍地亲吻着大理石碑，放声痛哭。他哭了整整一夜，第二天早晨还在哭，尽管他的眼泪已经哭干了，只有干呕的哭泣摇撼着他木制的身躯。但是，这些声音非常响亮，遥远的山峦都可以听到。

他一边抽泣，一边自言自语道：“噢，我的仙女，我最亲爱的仙女，你为什么死啊？你这么好，我这么坏，我为什么不死啊？还有我的爸爸——他可能会在哪儿呢？求求你，亲爱的仙女，告诉我他在哪儿，我永远永远不离开他了！你不是真的死了，对吗？要是你爱我，你就像以前那样活着回来吧！你不可怜我吗？我好孤独啊！要是那两个刺客来，它们就又会把我吊在大橡树上，这次我真的会死。我孤零零在这个世界上，该怎么办啊？你死了，我的爸爸也不见了，我去哪儿吃东西啊？我去哪儿睡啊？谁会给我做新衣服啊？噢，我想死！是的，我想死！噢！噢！噢！”

可怜的匹诺曹！他甚至想设法拽掉自己的头发，但他的头发只不过是画在木头上的，所以怎么也不可能拽下来。

正在这时，一只大鸽子从他的头顶飞过。看到木偶，大鸽子对他大声喊道：“小孩子，告诉我，你在那儿干什么？”

“你看不见吗？我在哭。”匹诺曹朝声音的方向抬起头，用袖子揉了揉眼睛，大声嚷道。

“告诉我，”鸽子问，“你认识一个叫匹诺曹的木偶吗？”

“匹诺曹！你是说匹诺曹？”木偶跳起来答道，“哎呀，我就是匹诺曹啊！”

听了这个回答，鸽子马上飞到了地上，它比一只火鸡还要大得多。

“那你也认识杰佩托吗？”

“我认识他？他是我的爸爸，是我的可怜的亲爸爸！他大概对你说起过我吧？你带我去见他好吗？他还活着吗？请回答我！他还活着吗？”

“我是三天前在一个大海边离开他的。”

“他在干什么？”

“他在造一条小船，要漂洋过海。在过去的四个月里，那个可怜人一直在欧洲漫游寻找你。因为还没有找到你，所以他就下定决心漂洋过海去新大陆寻找你。”

“从这儿到海边有多远？”匹诺曹焦急地问道。

“八十多公里。”

“八十多公里？噢，亲爱的鸽子，我要是有你这样一双翅膀该多好啊！”

“你要是去，我就带你一块儿去。”

“怎么带？”

“你骑在我的背上。你很重吗？”

“重？一点儿也不重！我只不过是一根羽毛。”

“很好。”

匹诺曹二话不说，跳上鸽子的背，坐好后，他欢快地大声叫道：“快跑，快跑，我漂亮的骏马！我要快点儿到。”

鸽子飞走了，不一会儿就飞到了云端。木偶低头朝下看，顿时头晕目眩，吓得拼命抓住鸽子的脖子，以防自己掉下来。

他们飞了一整天，快到傍晚时，鸽子说：“我很渴啊！”

“我也很饿呀！”匹诺曹说。

“我们到下面那个鸽巢待一会儿，然后再继续飞，明天早上就能到那个海边了。”

他们落进了一个空鸽笼，那儿只有一碗水和满满一小篮鹰嘴豆。

木偶一向讨厌鹰嘴豆，根据他的说法，鹰嘴豆总是让他恶心。但是，那天夜里，他却吃得津津有味，吃完时，他转过身对鸽子说道：“我从来没有想到鹰嘴豆会这么好吃！”

“我的孩子，你必须记住，”鸽子回答说，“饥饿是最好的调料！”

他们又休息了一会儿之后，就再次起程了。第二天早晨，他们来到了海边。

匹诺曹跳下鸽子背。鸽子做了好事，却不要任何感谢，马上飞走，不见了踪影。

海边到处都是人。他们望着大海，一边尖叫，一边拽着头发。

“出什么事儿了？”匹诺曹问一位老太太。

“一位可怜的老父亲不久前丢了唯一的儿子，今天他造了一条小船，就为了漂洋过海去寻找儿子。海浪汹涌，我们担心他会被淹死。”

“小船在哪儿？”

“在那儿，就在那前方。”老太太指着一个小黑影说。那个黑影还没有核桃壳大，正在海上漂浮着。

匹诺曹仔细看了一会儿，然后尖声叫道：“那是我的爸爸！那是我的爸爸！”

这时，小船被汹涌的波涛颠来荡去，时隐时现。匹诺曹站到一块高高的礁石上，苦苦寻找，对他又是挥手，又是挥帽子，甚至挥动起了鼻子。

尽管离岸很远，好像杰佩托也认出了自己的儿子，因为他脱下帽子，也挥动起来，仿佛是想让每个人明白，只要他能，就一定会回来。但是，风大浪急，他的船桨无济于事。突然，一个大浪打来，船不见了。

他们等啊等，就是不见船的踪影。

“可怜的人！”岸上的渔民们说，同时低声祈祷着，转身向家走去。

正在这时，传来一声绝望的哀叫。渔民们回过头来，只见匹诺曹跳进大海，大声呼喊：“我要救他！我要救爸爸！”

匹诺曹是木头做的，很容易浮到水面上，他像鱼一样在波涛中游了起来。他一会儿消失，一会儿又重新出现。眨眼间，他就远离了陆地，最后完全不见了踪影。

“可怜的孩子啊！”岸上的渔民们说。他们又低声祈祷了几句，然后就回家去了。





第二十四章


匹诺曹来到了勤劳蜜蜂国，又一次找到了仙女。



匹诺曹一心希望及时找到爸爸，救出他，于是整整游了一夜。

这是一个多么可怕的夜晚啊！大雨倾盆，冰雹连天，电闪雷鸣，夜如白昼。

黎明时分，他看到离他不远处有一片长长的沙地，这是大海当中的一座岛。

匹诺曹拼命想游到那儿，但没能成功。海浪戏弄着他，把他像一根小树枝或一根稻草一般抛来抛去。最后，他还算幸运，一个巨浪把他抛到了他想去的那个地方。可巨浪太猛了，他倒在地上时，身上的关节都破裂了，骨头差点儿折断。但是，他毫不畏惧，跳起来，大声说道：“我又一次得救了！”

天渐渐放亮了，太阳出来，光芒四射。海面平静如湖。

这时，木偶脱下衣服，铺在地上晒干。他望着海面，看是不是能看到那条载着他爸爸的小船。他找啊找，但只看到了大海、天空和远处的几个船帆，船帆小得就像是几只小鸟。

“如果我知道这个岛的名字就好了！”他自言自语道，“就是知道会在这儿找到什么人也好啊！可是，我问谁呢？这儿一个人也没有啊。”

一想到自己在这样一个凄凉的地方，他就伤心得想哭，但正在这时，他看到一条大鱼在附近游动，整个头都露出了水面。

木偶不知道这条鱼的名字，就对它说道：“嘿，鱼先生，我可以和你说句话吗？”

“只要你想，说两句也行。”那条鱼回答说，它碰巧是一条非常礼貌的海豚。

“请你告诉我，在这岛上有没有可以吃点儿东西却不会被吃掉的地方？”

“当然有，”海豚回答说，“其实，离这个地方不远你就可以找到。”

“那我怎么到那儿？”

“走你左边那条小道，顺着鼻子的方向走，你就不会走错。”

“再请问一下，你白天黑夜在海上游，有没有见过一条坐着我爸爸的小船呢？”

“谁是你的爸爸？”

“他是世界上最好的爸爸，哪怕我是世界上最坏的儿子。”

“昨夜刮暴风时，”海豚回答说，“小船已经沉没了。”

“那我的爸爸呢？”

“此时，他一定被可怕的鲨鱼吞没了。鲨鱼在过去的几天里一直在这片水域搞破坏。”

“这条鲨鱼很大吗？”匹诺曹问道，吓得浑身颤抖。

“它大吗？”海豚回答说，“为了让你对它的大小有个概念，我给你打个比方吧，它比一座五层楼还高，它的嘴又大又深，整列火车和火车头都能轻而易举地开进去。”

“我的妈呀！”木偶吓得要死，大声叫道。他飞快地穿上衣服，转向海豚，说道：“再见，鱼先生，原谅我打扰你，多谢你的好意。”

说完，他飞快地踏上小路，好像飞一样走了起来。而且每听到一点儿小声音，他就回头去看，唯恐那条五层楼高、嘴巴容下一列火车的鲨鱼尾随自己而来。

走了半小时后，他来到了一个叫“勤劳蜜蜂国”的小国。街上到处都是有事跑来跑去的人。人人都干活，人人都有事做。就是打起灯笼去找，也不可能找到一个懒汉和浪荡子。

“我明白了，”匹诺曹马上疲惫地说道，“这不是我待的地方，我生下来就不是干活的。”

但是，这时他开始感到很饿，因为他已经二十四小时没有吃东西了。

怎么办呢？

只有两个办法能让他吃到一点儿东西：要么干活，要么要饭。他羞于要饭，因为他的爸爸总是谆谆告诫，只有年老和残废的人才应该要饭。

他说过，在这个世界上，真正值得我们同情和帮助的穷人，是那些只有因年老和生病而没有办法再用自己的双手劳动去挣得面包的人。其他人都应当劳动，不劳动而挨饿，他们会更加糟糕。

正在这时，一个人走了过来。他筋疲力尽，热汗淋淋，正在吃力地拉着两车煤。

匹诺曹看了看他的脸，断定他是一个好人，就垂下眼睛，不好意思地说：“你行行好，给我一便士好吗，因为我要饿昏了！”

“不仅仅是一便士，”拉煤人回答说，“只要你帮我拉这两车煤，我给你四便士。”

“我真吃惊！”木偶回答说，非常生气，“我希望你知道，我从来不当驴，也从来没有拉过车。”

“那你最好这么办！”拉煤人回答说，“我的孩子，要是你真饿得发昏，那就切两片自尊来吃吧，我希望它们不会让你消化不良。”

几分钟后，一个砖瓦匠路过，肩上扛着满满一桶灰泥。

“好心人，行行好，给一个可怜的孩子一便士吧，我都饿得打哈欠了！”

“非常乐意，”砖瓦匠回答说，“来跟我一起扛这桶灰泥吧。我不是给你一便士，而是给你五便士。”

“可是，灰泥很重，”匹诺曹回答说，“这活儿对我太重了。”

“我的孩子，要是活儿对你太重，那你就享受哈欠吧，让它们给你带来好运吧！”

不到半小时，至少走过了二十个人。匹诺曹向他们一个个讨钱，但他们都回答说：“难道你不害臊吗？你不要当街乞讨了，何不找点活儿干干，自己挣面包吃呢？”

最后，一位小女人提着两个水罐走过来。

“好太太，你让我里喝一口你的瓦罐的水好吗？”匹诺曹问，他渴得火烧火燎的。

“非常乐意，我的孩子！”她把两只水罐放在地上回答说。

匹诺曹喝饱了水，一边擦嘴，一边咕哝道：“我不渴了。我要是能这样轻易摆脱饥饿，该多好啊！”

听了这话，好心的小女人马上说道：“要是你帮我把这些水罐提回家，我就给你一片面包。”

匹诺曹看着瓦罐，未置可否。

“而且有了面包，我还会给你一碟漂亮的花椰菜，上面带有白色沙司。”

匹诺曹又看了一眼水罐，还是未置可否。

“吃完花椰菜，还有蛋糕和果酱呢。”

听了这最后一样好东西，匹诺曹再也忍不住了，坚定地说：“很好。我替你把这罐水提到家里。”

水罐很重，木偶两只手提不动，只好举到头顶。

到了家里，小女人让匹诺曹在一张小桌边坐下来，在他面前放上面包、花椰菜和蛋糕。匹诺曹不是吃而是吞，他的肚子好像一个无底洞似的。

最后解除了饥饿，他才抬起头来，感谢善良的恩人。但是，他看了她没多久，就惊叫一声，瞪大眼睛坐在那儿，叉子举在空中，嘴里塞满了面包和花椰菜。

“你为什么这样吃惊？”好心的女人笑着问道。

“因为——”匹诺曹结结巴巴回答说，“因为——你看起来像是——你让我想起了——对，对，是同样的声音，同样的眼睛，同样的头发——对，对，对，你也有她那样天蓝色的头发——噢，我的小仙女，我的小仙女！告诉我这就是你！别让我再哭了！你要是知道该多好啊！我已经哭够了，我已经受够了！”

随后，匹诺曹扑倒在地，紧紧抱住这位神秘小女人的膝盖。





第二十五章


匹诺曹向仙女保证要学好，要学习，因为他渐渐厌倦做一个木偶，想成为一个真正的男孩子。



要是匹诺曹哭得更久，小女人认为他就会融化掉，所以她最后承认她就是天蓝色头发的仙女。

“你这淘气的木偶！你怎么知道是我啊？”她笑着问道。

“是我对你的爱告诉了我你是谁。”

“你还记得吗？你离开我时，我还是一个小姑娘，现在你发现我是一个大人了。我年龄大得差不多可以做你的妈妈了！”

“我非常高兴，因为这样我就可以叫你妈妈，而不是叫你姐姐了。我想要妈妈已经很长时间了，就像别的男孩子一样。可是，你怎么长得这样快呀？”

“这是一个秘密！”

“告诉我吧。我也想长大一点儿。看看我！我从来没有长得比价值一便士的奶酪高过。”

“你可不能长了。”仙女回答说。

“为什么不能？”

“因为木偶从来不长，他们生是木偶，活是木偶，死了还是木偶。”

“噢！我讨厌总是做木偶！”匹诺曹厌烦地叫道，“现在到了让我像其他每个人那样变成一个人的时候了。”

“你要是配得上，就会变人的。”

“真的吗？我怎样才能配得上呢？”

“这是一件非常简单的事。努力做一个好孩子。”

“你认为我不是个好孩子吗？”

“差远了！好孩子听话，而你正好相反——”

“我从来不听话。”

“好孩子爱学习、爱干活，可你——”

“相反，我一年四季偷懒浪荡。”

“好孩子总是说实话。”

“而我总是撒谎。”

“好孩子乐意上学。”

“要是上学，我就会生病。从现在起，我要改变。”

“你保证吗？”

“我保证。我要做一个好孩子，成为爸爸的安慰。我可怜的爸爸现在在哪儿呢？”

“我不知道。”

“我还能幸运地找到他、拥抱他吗？”

“我想是这样，我确实相信。”

听了这个回答，匹诺曹欢天喜地。他抓住仙女的手使劲亲吻起来，看上去就像疯了一样。随后，他抬起头来，亲热地看着她问道：“小妈妈，告诉我，你不是真死了吧？”

“好像不是。”仙女微笑着回答说。

“你要是知道我当时多么痛苦该多好，我是怎么流泪读到：‘这儿躺着——’”

“我知道，所以就原谅了你。你发自内心深处的伤心使我知道，你有一颗善心。像你这样有善心的男孩子，尽管常常十分淘气，但总还是有希望的。这就是我这么远来找你的原因。从现在起，我要做你的小妈妈。”

“噢！多么美呀！”匹诺曹高兴得跳起来叫道。

“你愿意总是听我的话，按照我的心愿去做吗？”

“乐意，非常乐意，再乐意不过了！”

“从明天开始，”仙女说，“你就每天去上学吧。”

匹诺曹的脸有点儿阴沉。

“然后，你要选择一种你最喜欢的手艺。”

匹诺曹更加严肃。

“你在咕哝什么？”仙女问。

“我刚才只是说，”木偶低声抱怨说，“让我现在才去上学，好像太晚了吧？”

“当然不晚。记住，学习永远不会晚。”

“可是，我既不想学手艺，也不想学专业。”

“为什么？”

“因为干活让我很累！”

“我亲爱的孩子，”仙女说，“像你这样说话的人，最后常常不是进牢房就是进医院。记住，一个人无论穷富，在这个世界上都应该做点事。不干活，谁也无法找到幸福。懒惰是一种严重的疾病，你必须马上治好它。是的，甚至要从小时候开始治。不然的话，最后它会害了你。”

这番话触动了匹诺曹的心，他抬眼望着仙女，认真地说：“我要干活，我要学习，你吩咐什么我就做什么。一句话，我已经厌倦了木偶的生活，我要做一个名副其实的男孩子。你答应我好吗？”

“好，我答应。现在就看你了。”





第二十六章


匹诺曹跟朋友们到海边去看那条可怕的鲨鱼。



第二天一大早，匹诺曹就去上学了。

试想一下，孩子们看到一个木偶走进教室会是什么情景啊！他们哈哈大笑，直笑得大喊起来。人人都捉弄他。有的拽掉他的帽子，有的拽他的上衣，有的想在他的鼻子下面画胡子，有的想用细线绑在他的手上和脚上，让他跳舞。

起初匹诺曹还心平气和。不过，最后他失去了所有的耐性，转向折磨他的那些人，威胁他们道：

“小心点儿，孩子们。我来这儿可不是来开玩笑的。我尊重你们，也想让你们尊重我。”

“百事通博士万岁！你说出来的话像印出的书一样！”那些男孩子哈哈大笑道。一个最冒失的孩子伸手要抓木偶的鼻子。

但是，他出手不够快，因为匹诺曹在桌子下面伸出脚，在他的小腿骨上狠狠地踢了一下。

“噢，好硬的脚呀！”那个男孩子叫道，揉起了木偶踢过的地方。

“还有胳膊肘也很硬！甚至比脚还硬哩！”另一个嚷道。他因为开无礼的玩笑，肚子上挨了一胳膊肘。

匹诺曹踢一脚，打一下，大家马上对他刮目相看。人人都钦佩他，屁颠屁颠地服侍他，爱抚他，拥抱他。

随着一天天、一周周的过去，就连老师也表扬起了他，因为他看到木偶专心听讲，努力学习，机警清醒，早上总是第一个来，放学后总是最后一个走。

匹诺曹唯一的缺点就是朋友太多了。其中有好多是有名的淘气鬼，这些人一点儿都不爱学习，一点儿都不想有出息。

老师天天警告他，甚至善良的仙女也对他说过多次：

“小心啊，匹诺曹！那些坏朋友早晚有一天会让你不爱学习，将来有一天还会让你误入歧途。”

“没有这种可能。”木偶耸了耸肩回答说，还指着额头，好像是说：“我太聪明了。”

于是，有一天，他去上学时，碰见几个男孩子，他们向他跑来说道：“你听说那个消息了吗？”

“没有听说！”

“有人看到海边来了一条大得像山一样的鲨鱼。”

“真的？不知道是不是吃掉我爸爸的那条鲨鱼？”

“我们去看看吧。你去吗？”

“不，我不去。我必须上学去。”

“学校有什么要紧呢？你明天可以去那儿嘛。多上一节课少上一节课，我们始终都是同样的傻瓜。”

“老师会怎么说呢？”

“让他说去吧。他一天到晚叽叽咕咕也该给他点儿报应了。”

“那我的妈妈呢？”

“妈妈们什么都不知道。”那些小淘气回答说。

“你们知道我会怎么做吗？”匹诺曹说。“我因为某种原因，也想去看看这条鲨鱼，但我要放学后去看。我可以到那时候再看它，跟现在看是一样的。”

“可怜的笨蛋！”其中一个男孩子叫道，“你以为那么大一条鱼会待在那儿等你吗？它转身就会游走，谁也不会永远聪明的。”

“从这儿到海边需要多长时间？”木偶问。

“来回一个小时。”

“那很好。看我们谁先跑到那儿！”匹诺曹叫道。

听到这个信号，这一群孩子把书夹在腋下，猛地冲过田野。匹诺曹在前面领路，像长了翅膀一样奔跑着。其他人尽可能快地跟在后面。

他不时地回头，看到跟在后面的人又热又累，舌头耷拉在外面，他痛快地笑出了声。可怜的男孩！他要是知道，因他的不听话会有一连串可怕的事发生在他身上，该多好啊！





第二十七章


匹诺曹和他的玩伴们发生了大战。其中一人受伤。匹诺曹被捕。



匹诺曹一阵风似的，不一会儿就跑到了海边。他看了看四周，但连鲨鱼的影子都没有见到。大海平静得像一面镜子。

“喂，伙计们！那条鲨鱼在哪儿？”他转向玩伴们问道。

“它可能吃早饭去了。”其中一个笑道。

“要不也许是去上床睡觉了。”另一个也笑道。

从接下来的回答和笑声中，匹诺曹明白那些男孩子跟他开了个玩笑。

“怎么？”他生气地对他们说，“你们在骗我？”

“噢，是跟你开玩笑嘛！”那些小坏蛋大声说道，比先前笑得更开心了，同时他们还在木偶身边欢快地跳着舞。

“什么？”

“我们不让你上学，让你跟我们走。你天天这样认真、这样用功，不害臊吗？你从来不会享受一点儿快乐。”

“我学我的，跟你们有什么关系？”

“关系大了，你不想想，这样一来，老师会对我们有什么看法……”

“为什么？”

“难道你不明白吗？要是你学习，而我们不学习，就会使我们很丢脸。”

“你们要我做什么？”

“像我们大家一样讨厌学校、书本和老师，让他们成为你的三大敌人，你要知道，他们总是让人讨厌。”

“要是我继续学习，你们拿我怎么办？”

“你会为此付出代价！”

“你们真好笑。”木偶摇了摇头说。

“嘿，匹诺曹，”其中最高的一个男孩子叫道，“够了。我们厌烦你自吹自擂，你这个妄自尊大的人！你也许不怕我们，但记住我们也不怕你！你要知道，你就一个人，我们有七个人呢。”

“七个罪过吧。”匹诺曹大笑着说。

“你们听见了吗？他在侮辱我们大家，他叫我们七个罪过。”

“匹诺曹！你要道歉，否则就要倒霉哟！”

“咕咕！”说着，木偶用大拇指指着鼻子，以示嘲笑。

“你会后悔的！”

“咕咕！”

“我们要狠狠地抽你！”

“咕咕！”

“你会带着个打断的鼻子回家的！”

“咕咕！”

“我们这就来揍你一个咕咕！拿着，留作你的晚饭吧。”其中最凶的一个叫道。说着，他在木偶头上狠狠地捣了一拳。

木偶也回敬了他一拳。这是一场混战开始的信号。过了一会儿，双方就拳来拳往激战了起来。

尽管势单力薄，但匹诺曹还是勇敢自卫。他那两只木脚飞快运动，使对手敬而远之。他的两只脚落到哪儿，哪儿就留下痛苦的痕迹。那些男孩子只能跑开，嗷嗷直叫。

他们无法和木偶近距离搏斗，怒不可遏，开始向他扔各种各样的书。各种阅读书、地理书、历史书、语法书从四面八方纷纷向他飞来。但是，木偶眼疾手快，那些书一本本地飞过他的头顶，全都落进海里不见了踪影。

那些鱼以为可能是什么好吃的东西，就成群成群游到水面上。有的轻轻咬了一口，有的咬了一大口，但尝过一两页后，都纷纷做了个鬼脸吐出来，好像是说：“味道真不好！还是我们自己的食物要好得多！”

这时，搏斗越来越激烈了。听到响声，一只大螃蟹从水里慢慢地爬出来，用因患感冒而像长号般的嗓音大声叫道：“别打了，你们这些小淘气！男孩子们这样打架很少会有好下场。你们肯定会闯祸的！”

可怜的螃蟹！它还不如对风说话。匹诺曹没有听螃蟹的好言相劝，而是转向它，用它知道的方式粗暴地说道：“安静，丑螃蟹！你最好还是去吃一些海草，治好你的感冒，上床睡觉吧！你明天感觉会好些的！”

与此同时，那些男孩子已经扔完了所有的书，回头去找新的“武器弹药”。看到木偶的书包就在不远处，他们一下子把它抢到了手。

其中有一本书很大，是一个算术课本，包着厚厚的皮革。那是匹诺曹引以为豪的东西，在所有的书中，他最喜欢那本。

想着这将是一枚优质“导弹”，其中一个男孩子就抓住这本书，用尽全力地朝匹诺曹的头上扔去。但是，他没有打中木偶，却扔到了另一个男孩子的头上。那个男孩子脸色煞白，有气无力地叫道：“噢，妈呀，救命！我要死了！”随后，就一动不动地倒在了地上。

看到那个脸色苍白的小尸体，那些男孩子胆战心惊，转身就跑，眨眼就不见了踪影。

除了匹诺曹之外，所有人都不见了。尽管被所发生的一切吓得要死，但匹诺曹还是跑到海边，把手帕在凉爽的海水里浸了浸，敷在那个可怜的小同学的头上。他一边痛哭，一边对那个同学喊道：“尤金！我可怜的尤金啊！睁开眼睛看看我吧！你为什么不回答呀？你知道，不是我打的你！相信我，我没有那样做。睁开眼睛吧，尤金。要是你总是闭着眼睛，我也会死的。噢，哎呀，我现在怎么回家呀？我怎么再去见我的小妈妈呀？我会怎么样呢？我去哪儿呀？我藏在哪儿呀？噢，要是我去上学，那该多好，那要好上千倍呀！我为什么听那些男孩子的话？他们总是起坏作用。老师曾警告过我——妈妈也警告过我——‘谨防坏同伴！’她就是这样说的。可是，我既顽固又骄傲。他们讲他们的，我干我的！于是，我就付出了代价。我从出生就没有安生过一会儿！哎呀！我会怎么样呢？我会怎么样呢？”

匹诺曹一直哭哭啼啼，打自己的脑袋。他一遍又一遍地对这个小朋友叫喊，直到突然听到沉重的脚步声越来越近了。

他抬起头，看到两个高大的宪兵站在他身边。

“你伸展四肢躺在地上做什么？”他们问匹诺曹。

“我在救我这位同学。”

“他昏倒了吗？”

“应该说是这样。”一个宪兵弯下腰看着尤金说，“这个男孩子的太阳穴受伤了。是谁打伤他的？”

“不是我。”木偶结结巴巴地说，全身几乎连一丝力气也没有了。

“不是你，那又是谁？”

“不是我。”匹诺曹重复道。

“他是被什么东西打伤的？”

“是被这本书打伤的。”说着，木偶拿起算术课本给那个宪兵看。

“那这本书是谁的？”

“是我的。”

“够了。”

“不用再说了！赶快起来，跟我们走。”

“可我——”

“跟我们走！”

“可我是无辜的。”

“跟我们走！”

临走前，那两个宪兵冲几个正坐小船从岸边经过的渔民叫喊，对他们说道：“照顾好这个受伤的小家伙，把他送回家，包扎一下伤口。明天我们再来找他。”

随后，他们抓住匹诺曹，把他夹在中间，粗暴地说：“走！走快点儿！不然，对你更糟！”

他们不用说第二遍，木偶就沿路飞快地向村里走去。但是，这可怜的家伙简直不知道自己是干什么的。他以为自己做了一场噩梦，他感到恶心，眼睛看什么东西都是重影，两腿颤抖，舌头发干，尽管他十分努力，但他却说不出一个字。不过，尽管他感觉麻木，但一想到要从善良的仙女的窗下经过，他就痛彻心扉。她看到他夹在两个宪兵中间会说什么呢？

他们刚来到村边，突然一阵狂风刮掉了匹诺曹的帽子，帽子顺着街道飘了起来。

“你们让我去追自己的帽子好吗？”木偶对两个宪兵说。

“可以，去吧，但要快。”

木偶走过去拾起帽子，却没有戴到头上，而是用牙咬住，然后撒腿向海边飞奔。

他跑得像一颗出膛的子弹一样快。

两个宪兵眼看很难抓住他，就放出一条大猛犬去追他。这条狗在赛狗中还得过第一名呢。匹诺曹跑得快，狗跑得更快。听到这么大的嘈杂声，所有人不是把头探出窗户，就是聚在街上，迫不及待地想看到比赛的结果。但是，他们大失所望，因为狗和匹诺曹一路上扬起了漫天灰尘，不大一会儿就什么也看不见了。





第二十八章


匹诺曹冒着被当成鱼放在平底锅里油炸的危险。



在这场拼命的追逐中，匹诺曹经历了一个可怕的时刻，他因迷路最后都快要放弃了。这时，阿利多罗（那条猛犬的名字）一路狂奔，已经离他很近了，眼看就要追上他了。

木偶能听到紧贴在他身后的野兽吃力的喘气声，甚至不时地感觉到它呼出的热气。

幸亏，这时，他已经到了海边，大海就在眼前，只有短短几步远了。

木偶一踏上海滩，就像青蛙似的纵身一跳，跳进了水里。阿利多罗本想停住脚步，但它由于跑得太快，停不下来，也跟着落进了水里。尽管听来奇怪，但这条狗确实不会游泳，它用爪子拍打着水，想浮起来，但它越用劲儿，沉得就越深。可怜的狗又一次把头伸出来，两眼凸出，汪汪狂叫道：“我要淹死了！我要淹死了！”

“那就淹死吧！”匹诺曹在远处回答，对自己能逃脱感到非常高兴。

“救命，匹诺曹，亲爱的小匹诺曹！救我一命吧！”

木偶毕竟有一颗非常善良的心，他听到那些痛苦的叫声，就起了恻隐之心。他转向可怜的狗说道：“可是，要是我救你，你保证不再找我麻烦，不追我了吗？”

“我保证！我保证！只是要快点儿，因为你要是再等一秒钟，我就死定了！”

匹诺曹又犹豫了一会儿。随后，他想起了爸爸常常对他说的做好事绝不会吃亏，就游到了阿利多罗身边，抓住了狗尾巴，把它拽到了岸边。

可怜的狗有气无力，连站都站不住了。它喝了好多海水，胀得像一只气球。然而，木偶还是不太相信它，便又一次扑进了海里。他一边游离海岸，一边大声喊道：“再见，阿利多罗，祝你好运，并代我向你的家人问好！”

“再见，小匹诺曹！”狗回答说，“万分感谢你救了我的命，你对我真是大恩大德。在这个世界上，总是善有善报。一有机会，我就会报答你的。”

匹诺曹继续靠着岸边游。最后，他认为自己已经到了一个安全的地方。他朝海滩两边瞧了瞧，只见一个山洞口冒出了袅袅青烟。

“那山洞里，”他自言自语说，“一定有火。那是再好不过的了。我要烤干衣服，暖和暖和，然后……然后……呃……”

匹诺曹决心已定，游到了礁石边。但是，他正要上岸，突然感到水底下有一样东西将他越托越高。他想逃脱，但为时已晚。让他大为吃惊的是，他发现自己在一个大渔网里，夹在一大堆鱼中间。这些鱼形形色色、有大有小，正拼命想挣脱开来。

正在这时，他看到一个渔夫从山洞里走出来。这个渔夫非常难看，匹诺曹还以为他是一个海怪。只见他的头上不是头发，而是厚厚的一丛绿草。他身上的皮肤是绿色的，眼睛是绿色的，长长的胡子也是绿色的，一直垂到脚上。他看上去像一条有腿有臂的巨蜥。

渔夫把渔网从海里拉出来后，兴高采烈地叫道：“上帝保佑！我又要吃一顿鲜鱼了！”

“谢天谢地，我不是鱼！”匹诺曹一边自言自语，一边尽力从这些话中找到一点儿勇气。

渔夫把渔网和鱼都带到山洞里。这是一个阴暗冒烟的地方。山洞当中，一个油锅在一堆冒烟的火上咝咝响，发出一股难闻的让人窒息的牛油味。

“现在让我来看看捉到了什么鱼。”说着，绿渔夫把铲子一样的大手伸进渔网，掏出了一把胭脂鱼。

“漂亮的胭脂鱼，这些都是！”他看了看，愉快地闻了闻，之后把它们扔进了一个空荡荡的大盆里。

他如此这般重复了好多次这个动作。他每次从渔网里掏出一条鱼，想起即将到来的美餐，嘴里就流口水，他说：

“这些鲈鱼好极了！

“这些鲑鱼真香！

“这些比目鱼真鲜！

“这些螃蟹真棒！

“还有这些亲爱的小凤尾鱼，它们的头还在上面！”

你完全可以想象，这些鲈鱼、比目鱼、鲑鱼甚至小凤尾鱼和那些胭脂鱼都被放进盆里是什么情景。最后一个从渔网里出来的是匹诺曹。

渔夫一把他抓出来，两只绿眼睛就吃惊地瞪得溜圆。他惊恐地叫道：“这是哪种鱼啊？我想不起来曾吃过这种鱼。”

他仔细地看着木偶，翻来覆去地看过后说道：

“我明白了，这一定是螃蟹！”

匹诺曹对自己被当成螃蟹感到耻辱，他充满愤恨地说：“胡说八道！什么螃蟹！我绝不是那种东西。瞧你把我当成什么了！我想要你知道，我是一个木偶。”

“木偶？”渔夫问，“我必须承认，木偶鱼对我来说完全是一种新鱼！那再好不过了。我更要津津有味地吃你了。”

“吃我？可是，难道你不明白我不是鱼吗？难道你没有发现我和你一样会说话、会思考吗？”

“这倒不错，”渔夫回答说，“可是，因为我看到你是一条鱼，完全能像我一样说话和思考，所以我很愿意给你应有的照顾。”

“什么照顾？……”

“就是说，为了表示我的敬意，我让你选择怎样来烹调你。你喜欢在油锅里炸，还是喜欢浇上番茄酱煮？”

“实话告诉你，”匹诺曹回答说，“要是必须选择的话，我宁愿请您放了我，让我回家去！”

“你是在开玩笑吧？你以为我想失去品尝一条珍稀鱼的机会吗？木偶鱼是不会常常来这些海域的。照我说的办吧，我要把你和其他鱼放在油锅里炸。我知道你会喜欢的。发现自己有那么多鱼做伴总是一种安慰。”

听到这些，不幸的匹诺曹开始号啕大哭，苦苦哀求。他泪流满面地说道：“要是我当初去上学该多好啊！我当初听信了玩伴的话，现在我要付出代价了！噢！噢！噢！”

随后，木偶像鳗鱼一样挣扎扭动，想从渔夫手里逃出来。绿渔夫拿起一条结实的绳索，捆住匹诺曹的手脚，然后把他扔到了盆底，让他和其他鱼待在一起。

接着，他从一个食橱里拉出一大木碗面粉，开始把鱼一条一条在面粉里滚动。

当鱼都变白时，渔夫把它们都投进了锅里。第一个在热油里跳舞的是胭脂鱼，接着是鲈鱼，然后是鲑鱼、比目鱼和凤尾鱼，最后轮到了匹诺曹。

看到死期（而且死得这样可怕！）临近，匹诺曹吓得开始颤抖，连哀求饶命的声音也发不出来了。

这可怜的孩子只好用眼睛哀求。但是，绿渔夫根本没有注意到。他把木偶在面粉里翻来翻去，直到匹诺曹看上去像一个白垩木偶。

随后，渔夫抓住了他的头……





第二十九章


匹诺曹回到仙女的家里。仙女答应他，他第二天不用再当木偶，要变成一个男孩子。他们举行一次咖啡牛奶早餐宴会来庆祝这件大事。



匹诺曹没有忘记渔夫说过的话，知道所有被救的希望都没有了。他闭上了眼睛，等待最后的时刻。

突然，一条大狗跑进了山洞，它是被炸鱼的气味吸引来的。

“出去！”渔夫对狗恫吓道，手里仍然紧紧抓着浑身蘸满面粉的木偶。

但是，可怜的狗很饿，它一边呜呜叫，一边摇着尾巴，像是在说：“给我一口鱼，我就安安生生地离开。”

“我说，出去！”渔夫又说了一次，然后抽出一条腿，踢了狗一脚。

这时，狗是真饿了，不容否定，它愤怒地转向渔夫，露出了可怕的犬牙。正在这时，一个可怜微弱的声音说：“救救我，阿利多罗。你要是不救我，我就要下油锅了！”

狗马上听出了匹诺曹的声音。它非常吃惊地发现，声音来自渔夫手里握的那团蘸满面粉的小东西。

那它是怎么做的呢？只见它纵身一跃，将那团东西咬在嘴里，用牙齿轻轻地衔着，冲过洞门，像闪电一样不见了踪影！

看到美食从自己的鼻子底下被夺去，渔夫非常生气，就向那条狗追去，但一阵严重的咳嗽使他停下脚步，开始往回走。

这时，阿利多罗一发现通向村子的路，就停下来，把匹诺曹轻轻地放在了地上。

“我真是对你感激不尽！”木偶说。

“不用谢，”狗回答说，“你救过我一次，善总是有善报。在这个世界上我们大家要互相帮助。”

“可是，你是怎么进到那个山洞的？”

“我躺在那儿的沙滩上半死不活的，这时一股炸鱼的香味飘到了我的身边。那股香味引起了我的食欲，我顺着香味就来了。噢，我要是晚来一会儿，那就坏了！”

“别说了，”匹诺曹哭道，仍然吓得浑身发抖，“别说了。你要是晚来一会儿，我就会被炸熟、吃掉，现在已经被消化掉了。噢噢噢！只要一想到这些，我就浑身发抖。”

阿利多罗笑着向木偶伸出爪子，木偶亲切地握了握，感觉现在他和狗成了好朋友。随后，他们相互告别，狗就回家去了。

匹诺曹独自留下来，向附近的一间小棚屋走去。一位老人正坐在棚屋门口晒太阳。木偶问道：“好人，告诉我，你听说过一个头部受伤的可怜男孩子吗？他的名字叫尤金。”

“那个男孩子被送到过这个棚屋，现在——”

“现在他死了吗？”匹诺曹伤心地打断说。

“没有，他现在活着，已经回家去了。”

“真的吗？真的吗？”木偶高兴得跳起来叫道，“这么说，伤得不重？”

“不过，他有可能伤得很重——甚至会丧命，”老人回答说，“因为一本厚书打中了他的脑袋。”

“那是谁扔的？”

“是他的一个同学，名叫匹诺曹。”

“那这个匹诺曹是谁？”木偶问，假装不知道。

“他们说他是一个捣蛋鬼、浪荡子、街头混混——”

“诽谤！完全是诽谤！”

“你认识这个匹诺曹吗？”

“见过！”木偶回答说。

“那你认为他怎么样？”老人问。

“我认为他是一个非常好的孩子，他爱学习，孝顺爸爸，又爱全家人——”

木偶一边撒着弥天大谎，一边摸自己的鼻子，发现鼻子是原来的两倍长。他吓得魂不附体，大声叫道：“别听我的话，好人！我说的他的所有优点都不是真的。我了解匹诺曹，他的确是一个小坏蛋，懒惰，不听话，不去上学，跟着一帮坏同学逃学。”

说到这儿，他的鼻子又回到了自然状态。

“为什么你整个人白成这样？”老人突然问道。

“我告诉你。我没有留意，蹭到了一堵新刷的墙上。”木偶撒谎说，不好意思说有人曾准备把他扔进油锅。

“你的上衣、帽子和马裤是怎么回事？”

“我遇到了小偷，他们抢劫了我。好人，告诉我，你有没有一件衣服给我穿？这样我就可以回家了。”

“我的孩子，说到衣服，我只有一条装蛇麻草的袋子。你想要的话就拿去吧。给。”

没等他再说第二遍，匹诺曹就拿起这条刚好没有装东西的袋子，在袋口剪了一个大窟窿，又在两边剪了两个窟窿，就像衬衣那样穿了上去。他穿好后就向村里走去。

他一路上感到心神不安。事实上，他是闷闷不乐，向前走两步，又向后退一步，而且一边走，一边自言自语道：“我怎么面对好心的小仙女呀？看到我，她会说什么呢？她会原谅我最后这次的恶作剧吗？我敢说她是不会原谅的。噢，不，她不会原谅。我像往常一样是罪有应得！因为我是淘气鬼，从来不能好好信守诺言！”

他深夜才来到村里。天很黑，他什么也看不见，天正下着大雨。

匹诺曹径直走到仙女家，决定敲门。

可是一走到那儿时，他就失去了勇气，往回跑了几步。他第二次来到门边，还是不敢敲门，又跑了回去。第三次他又重复了这个动作。第四次，趁还没有失去勇气，他抓住门环，让门环微微响了一下。

他等啊等啊等，最后，过了整整半小时，顶楼的一扇窗户（房子有四层）才打开，匹诺曹看到一只大蜗牛探出头来，只见蜗牛头顶上有一盏小灯闪闪发亮。“这么晚了，谁敲门啊？”蜗牛问。

“仙女在家吗？”木偶问。

“仙女睡了，不想让人打搅。你是谁？”

“是我。”

“我是谁？”

“匹诺曹。”

“匹诺曹是谁？”

“是木偶，是住在仙女房子里的一个木偶。”

“噢，我明白了，”蜗牛说，“你在那儿等着我，我这就下来给你开门。”

“求求你快点儿，因为我要冻死了。”

“我的孩子，我是一只蜗牛，蜗牛从来不急。”

一个小时过去了，两个小时过去了，门还是关闭着。匹诺曹因害怕和背上落的冷雨而浑身哆嗦。于是，他又敲了一次，这次比上次敲得更响。

听到第二次敲门声，三楼的窗户打开了，还是那只蜗牛探出头来。

“亲爱的小蜗牛，”匹诺曹从街上叫道，“我已经等你两个小时了！这么可怕的夜晚，两个小时就像两年一样漫长。请快点儿。”

“我的孩子，”蜗牛心平气和地回答说，“我亲爱的孩子，我是一只蜗牛，蜗牛从来不急。”说完，窗户又关上了。

过了一会儿，午夜的钟声敲响了，随后是一点钟、两点钟，门还是关着！

这时，匹诺曹失去了所有的耐心，他两手抓住门环，决定唤醒整个房子和整条街的人。然而，他一摸到门环，门环变成了一条鳗鱼，扭动而去，爬进了黑暗当中。

“这是真的吗？”匹诺曹叫道，气得发昏，“门环没有了，我还能用脚踢。”

他后退一步，冲过去狠狠地踢了门一脚。他踢得太猛了，一只脚直接踢穿了门，他的半条腿差不多都插到门里去了。木偶想拔出腿，无论怎么拖曳，也无法拔出来。它像被钉在门上一样。

可怜的匹诺曹！剩下的夜晚，他只好一只脚插在门里，另一只脚吊在空中度过了。

黎明时分，门终于打开了。那只勇敢的小动物——蜗牛整整花了九个小时才从四楼爬到了街上。老实说，它一定是全速行进！

“你把一只脚插在门里干什么？”蜗牛笑着问木偶。

“真倒霉。漂亮的小蜗牛，难道你不能把我从这可怕的折磨中解救出来吗？”

“我的孩子，这件事我们得找木匠，我从来没有当过木匠啊。”

“请仙女救救我吧！”

“仙女睡了，不想让人打搅。”

“可是，我这样钉在门上，你叫我干什么呢？”

“自得其乐数数路过的蚂蚁呗。”

“至少给我送点儿吃的，因为我要饿昏了。”

“马上！”

事实上，过了三个半小时后，匹诺曹才看到蜗牛头顶着一只银托盘回来。托盘上有面包、烤鸡和水果。

“这是仙女送给你的早饭。”蜗牛说。

看到这些好东西，木偶感觉好多了。

然而，他一尝，马上就倒胃口，因为他发现面包是白垩做的，烤鸡是纸板做的，鲜亮的水果是彩色石膏做的！

他想要哭喊，他万念俱灰，他想扔掉托盘和上面的所有东西。但是，他要么是因为痛苦，要么是因为虚弱，昏死在了地上。

等他醒来时，发现自己躺在一张沙发上，仙女就坐在他的身边。

“这次我也会原谅你的，”仙女对他说，“当心可不要再淘气了。”

匹诺曹答应她要读书学习，要规规矩矩。而且这年剩下的时间，他都说话算数。年终时，他每门考试都得了第一名，他的报告非常出色，仙女高兴地对他说道：“明天你的愿望就会实现的。”

“什么愿望？”

“明天你就不再是一个木偶，而要变成一个真正的男孩子了。”

匹诺曹高兴得忘乎所以。他所有的朋友和同学都一定会应邀来庆祝这件大喜事！仙女答应准备两百杯牛奶咖啡和四百片两面都涂有黄油的面包。

那天准是一个非常快乐幸福的日子，但是——

不幸的是，木偶的一生中总有“但是”，这个“但是”很容易毁掉所有的一切。





第三十章


匹诺曹没有成为男孩子，而是跟他的朋友灯芯一起跑到了玩具国。



一开始仙女的话使匹诺曹感到吃惊，最后他终于不再吃惊，请求仙女允许他发出邀请。

“当然，你可以邀请你的朋友们来参加明天的聚会，只是要记住天黑前就得回家。明白了吗？”

“我一小时后肯定回来。”木偶回答道。

“当心点儿，匹诺曹！男孩子们总是非常容易给予承诺，但也容易忘记。”

“可是，我和那些人不一样，我说到做到。”

“我们看吧。万一你真的不听话，受苦的会是你自己，而不是别人。”

“为什么？”

“因为不听长辈话的男孩子们总会倒霉。”

“我确实曾倒霉过，”匹诺曹说，“但从现在起，我会听话的。”

“我们要看你说的是不是真话。”

木偶二话不说告别了好心的仙女，又唱又跳离开了家。

过了一小时多一点儿，所有的朋友都受到了邀请。有人爽快地接受了邀请，有人还得哄一下，但当听说有两面涂黄油的烤面包时，他们最后都这样说道：“为了让你高兴，我们一定来。”

现在大家要知道，在所有的朋友中，匹诺曹有一个最喜欢的，名字叫罗密欧，但人人都叫他“灯芯”，因为他又高又瘦，一副愁眉苦脸的样子。

灯芯在学校里是最懒惰、最捣蛋的男孩子，但匹诺曹非常喜欢他。

那天，匹诺曹直接去他这个朋友家邀请他参加宴会，但灯芯不在家。他又去了第二次、第三次，但还是没有见他。

他可能会去哪儿呢？匹诺曹找遍了所有地方，最后发现他藏在一个农夫的马车里。

“你在那儿干什么？”匹诺曹跑到他的身边问道。

“我要等半夜出发去——”

“去哪儿？”

“去很远很远的地方！”

“我已经到你家里找你三次了！”

“你找我干什么？”

“难道你没有听到消息？难道你不知道我交的好运？”

“什么好运？”

“明天我就不再是木偶，要变成像你和所有其他朋友一样的男孩子了。”

“祝你好运！”

“我在明天的聚会上可以见到你吗？”

“可我告诉你，我今天夜里就要走了。”

“几点钟？”

“午夜时分。”

“你要去哪儿？”

“去一个真正的国家——世界上最好的国家——一个奇妙的地方！”

“它叫什么名字？”

“它叫‘玩具国’。你干吗不跟我一起去呢？”

“我？噢，不！”

“那你就要犯一个大错了，匹诺曹。相信我，你要是不去，就会后悔的。你能到哪儿找一个更适合你和我的地方呢？那儿没有学校，没有老师，没有书本！在那个福地，根本没有学习这种东西。在那儿，只有星期六，我们不用上学。在玩具国，除了星期天，每天都是星期六。假期从一月一日开始，十二月最后一天结束。那就是我要待的地方！所有的国家都应该像这样！我们大家会多么开心啊！”

“可是，‘玩具国’里的日子是怎么过的啊？”

“日子在玩乐中度过，从早玩到晚。夜里上床睡觉，第二天早晨又开始玩。你觉得怎么样？”

“嗯——！”匹诺曹点了点头，好像是要说：“这种生活完全适合我。”

“那你想跟我一起去吗？想还是不想？你必须做出决定。”

“不，不，不！我已经答应过好心的仙女，要成为一个好孩子，我要说话算数。请看，太阳就要落下去了，我必须离开你，赶快走。再见，祝你好运。”

“你这么急去哪儿呀？”

“家。我的好仙女要我天黑前回家。”

“再等两分钟吧。”

“太晚了！”

“就两分钟。”

“那要是仙女责备我呢？”

“让她责备吧。她累了，就不责备了。”灯芯说。

“你一个人去还是和别人一起去？”

“一个人？我们有一百多人呢！”

“你们要走路去吗？”

“午夜时分，有辆马车会经过这儿，要带我们到那个神奇的国家去。”

“我是多么希望午夜的钟声敲响！”

“为什么？”

“我想看着你们动身。”

“在这儿再待一会儿，你就会看到的！”

“不，不，我要回家。”

“再等两分钟。”

“其实我已经待得太久了，仙女会担心的。”

“可怜的仙女！她是怕蝙蝠会吃了你吗？”

“听着，灯芯，”匹诺曹又说道，“你真的肯定玩具国没有学校吗？”

“连一个学校的影子也没有。”

“连一个老师也没有吗？”

“一个也没有。”

“也不必学习吗？”

“永远，永远，永远不必！”

“多么伟大的国家！”匹诺曹说，垂涎欲滴，“多么美丽的国家啊！我从来没有到过那儿，但我完全可以想象到。”

“那你干吗不也去呢？”

“你引诱我也没用！我告诉过你，我答应过好心的仙女要规规矩矩，我要说话算数。”

“那就再见吧，代我向初级中学、高级中学甚至大学的学生们问好，要是你在路上碰见他们的话。”

“再见，灯芯，一路顺风，祝你过得愉快，偶尔要记起你的朋友们哟。”

说完，木偶就要踏上回家的路。他又一次转向朋友，问道：“你确信那个国家一个星期是由六个星期六和一个星期天组成的吗？”

“完全确信！”

“那假期都是一月一日开始，十二月最后一天结束吗？”

“非常非常确信！”

“多么伟大的国家啊！”匹诺曹又说了一遍，不知道该怎么做。随后，他突然下定决心，匆匆说道：“最后一次再见，祝你好运。”

“再见。”

“你们多久走？”

“不出两个小时。”

“多么可惜啊！要是只有一个小时，我还可以等你。”

“那仙女呢？”

“现在我已经晚了，多一个小时少一个小时没有什么两样。”

“可怜的匹诺曹！要是仙女责备你呢？”

“噢，我让她责备好了。她累了之后就不责备了。”

这时，天越来越黑了。突然，远处一盏小灯闪烁起来。这时传来了一种奇怪的声音，像小铃铛一样轻柔，又像一只遥远的蚊子发出的微弱的嗡嗡声。

“来了！”灯芯跳起来叫道。

“什么？”匹诺曹低声问道。

“是来接我的马车。最后再问一次，你去不去？”

“那个国家的男孩子永远不必学习，的确是真的吗？”

“永远，永远，永远不必！”

“多么奇妙、美丽、奇特的国家呀！噢——！”





第三十一章


玩了五个月后，一个晴朗的早晨，匹诺曹醒来时发现一个大大的意外在等着他。



最后，马车到了。马车没有发出任何声音，因为轮子上裹着稻草和破布。

拉车的是十二对驴子，它们都大小相同，但毛色不同，有的是灰的，有的是白的，还有的是棕黑相间的，有几头身上到处都是黄蓝相间的大条纹。

最奇怪的是，那二十四头驴子，不像其他驮货的牲口那样打着铁掌，而是像男孩子们那样脚上穿着皮革做的花边鞋。

那赶马车的呢？

你自己想象一下，那人是一个小胖子，横宽竖短，像黄油球一样圆溜溜、亮锃锃苹果似的脸喜气洋洋，一张小嘴总是微微含笑，声音又小又甜，仿佛猫讨吃时的叫声。

任何一个男孩子一看到他，就会爱上他，要坐上他的车到那个叫玩具国的可爱地方才会满足。

其实，马车上已经挤满了各个年龄的男孩子，活像一箱沙丁鱼。他们挤得够呛，一个摞一个，简直喘不过气来，不过，他们没有一句怨言。一想到几个小时后就要到达一个没有学校、没有书本、没有老师的国家，这些男孩子就心花怒放，感觉不到什么饥饿、口渴、瞌睡和不适了。

马车一停，小胖子就转向灯芯，一边鞠躬微笑，一边以一种甜蜜的语气问道：“告诉我，我的好孩子，你也想来我那个奇妙的国家吗？”

“我的确想。”

“可是，我要告诉你，我的小宝贝，马车上已经没有地方了，全挤满了。”

“没关系，”灯芯回答说，“车里没有地方，我可以坐在车顶上。”

说着，他纵身一跃，坐在了车顶上。

“那你呢，我的宝贝？”小胖子客气地转向匹诺曹问，“你打算怎么办？你是想跟我们一起走，还是要留在这儿？”

“我留在这儿，”匹诺曹回答说，“我想要回家，因为我更喜欢学习，更喜欢一生成功。”

“愿那给你带来好运！”

“匹诺曹！”小灯芯大声喊道，“听我说，跟我们来吧，我们会非常开心。”

“不，不，不！”

“跟我们来吧，我们会非常开心。”车上又有四个人叫道。

“跟我们来吧，我们会非常开心。”车上一百多个男孩子齐声喊道。

“我要是跟你们去，我的好仙女会怎么说呢？”木偶问，他开始动摇了，变得优柔寡断。

“不要过分担心。只想一下，我们要去的是一个允许我们无拘无束从早玩到晚的国家。”

匹诺曹没有回答，只是深深地叹了一口气——两口气——三口气。最后，他说：“给我腾点儿地方，我也要去！”

“座位都挤满了，”小胖子回答说，“但为了表示我是多么欢迎你，坐到我的赶车座上来吧。”

“那你呢？”

“我走路。”

“真的不行。我可不能这样做。我更喜欢骑到一头驴子的身上。”匹诺曹叫道。

说干就干。匹诺曹走近第一头驴子，想骑上去。但是，这小牲口突然转过身，在他的肚子上狠狠地踢了一脚，把他踢了个两脚朝天。

看到这意想不到的有趣场面，所有逃学的男孩子都哈哈大笑。

小胖子没有笑，他走到倔强的牲口身边，仍然面带微笑，亲切地弯下腰，一口咬掉了驴子的半只右耳朵。

这时，匹诺曹从地上爬起来，纵身跃上了驴背。他跳得是那么漂亮，所有的男孩子都大声喊道：“匹诺曹万岁！”然后热烈鼓掌。

突然，小驴子扬起后蹄踢了一下，可怜的木偶猛不防，又一次四仰八叉倒在了路中央。

男孩子们又大笑起来。但是，小胖子没有笑，而是非常亲切地走向那头小驴，又亲了它一下，一口咬掉了它的半只左耳朵。

随后，他对匹诺曹说：“你现在可以骑上去了，我的孩子，不用怕。这头驴刚才有点儿不高兴，但我已经跟它说过了，现在它好像平静了，通情达理了。”

匹诺曹骑上去，马车就上路了。

当那些驴子沿着石子路飞奔时，木偶仿佛听到一个很轻的声音低声对他说道：“可怜的傻瓜！你总是随心所欲。可是，你不久便会后悔的！”

匹诺曹大惊失色，环顾四周，想看看这些话来自哪儿，但他谁也没有看到。驴子飞奔，车轮滚滚，男孩子们在睡觉（灯芯像睡鼠一样打鼾），又小又胖的马车夫睡意蒙眬地低声唱着。

走了大约两公里后，匹诺曹又听到那个微弱的声音低声说道：“记住，小傻瓜！男孩子不学习，避开书本、学校和老师，把所有的时间都用在了胡说八道和玩乐上，迟早会倒霉的。噢，我是多么熟悉这个啊！我完全可以向你证明这一点啊！总有一天你会像我现在一样痛哭……可是，到时候，那就太晚了！”

听到这些低语，木偶越来越害怕，他从一直骑着的驴背上跳到地上，跑到驴子跟前，两手抓住驴鼻子，望着它。想一下，木偶看到这头驴子在哭泣，像男孩子一样哭泣，是多么吃惊啊！

“嘿，车夫先生！”匹诺曹叫道，“你知道发生了什么怪事吗？这头驴子在哭泣。”

“让它哭吧，它结了婚就会笑的。”

“也许你教会它说话了吧？”

“没有。它和一群受过训练的狗一起待过三年，就学会了咕哝几句。”

“可怜的牲口！”

“嘿，嘿，”小胖子说，“别为一头哭泣的驴子浪费时间了，赶快骑上去，我们走。夜凉路长啊。”

匹诺曹二话没说，马上照办。马车重新上路了。第二天早晨天快亮时，他们终于来到了梦想中的玩具国。

这个伟大国家和世界上任何其他地方都完全不一样。它的人口尽管很多，但全都是男孩子，最大的大约十四岁，最小的八岁。街上的喧闹声、叫喊声、喇叭声震耳欲聋。到处都是一群群的男孩子聚在一起，有的打弹子，有的扔石片，有的打球，有的骑自行车或木马，有的玩盲人捉迷藏，有的玩触碰捉人游戏。这儿一群人玩马戏，那儿又有一群人唱歌和朗诵，这儿有几个人翻跟头，那儿有几个人拿大顶，还有的人身穿将军服领着一大群纸板兵走过。欢笑声、尖叫声、吼叫声、发嘘声、拍手声紧随着这支队伍。一个男孩子发出母鸡一样的叫声，另一个男孩子像公鸡一样打鸣，第三个男孩子模仿窝巢里的狮子。总而言之，他们喧哗吵闹，你不得不用棉花塞住耳朵。广场上到处都是小木戏棚，从早到晚挤满了男孩子，房子的墙壁上用木炭写着这样的字：“玩具国万岁！”“打倒算术！”“不再要学校！”

匹诺曹、灯芯和所有其他跟他们同行的男孩子一踏进那个国家，就开始了考察旅游。他们到处漫游，观察每个角落、房子和戏院，他们都成了大家的朋友。谁能比他们更开心呢？

在各种娱乐和聚会当中，一小时又一小时，一天又一天，一周又一周，都闪电般过去了。

“噢，这是多么美好的生活啊！”匹诺曹每次碰巧见到他的朋友灯芯就说。

“看，我的话不错吧？”灯芯回答说，“想想你不来是什么情景吧！甚至昨天你还想着回家去看你的仙女，重新开始学习呢！你今天摆脱了铅笔、书本和学校，应该感谢我，感谢我的建议，感谢我的关心，对不对？只有真正的朋友才会帮你这么大的忙。”

“说得对，灯芯，你说得对。今天我能成为真正快乐的孩子，都是因为你。想想老师过去说到你时经常对我说：‘不要跟那个灯芯在一起！他是坏朋友，将来有一天他会把你领向邪路。’”

“可怜的老师！”灯芯点了点头回答说，“我的确知道他是多么不喜欢我，他是多么喜欢说我的坏话。可是，我具有宽宏大量的本性，而且我很高兴原谅他。”

“伟大的人！”匹诺曹充满感情地拥抱着他的朋友说。

五个月过去了，男孩子们继续从早到晚地玩耍，玩得非常开心，从来没有见过一本书、一张书桌或一所学校。但是，我的孩子们，有一天早晨，匹诺曹醒来时，发现一个巨大的意外在等着他，这个意外使他感到非常不快，你一定会看到。





第三十二章


匹诺曹的耳朵变成了驴耳朵。又过了一小会儿，他变成了一头真正的驴子——而且开始像驴一样叫。



每个人都曾经发现某个意外在等着自己。匹诺曹的生命中就有这种意外，只是不多。

这个意外是什么呢？我会告诉你们的，亲爱的小读者们。醒来时，匹诺曹抬起一只手摸他的头，发现那儿——

猜猜看他发现了什么？

他发现夜间他的耳朵至少长了整整二十五厘米！

你一定知道，木偶一生下来，耳朵就很小，小得肉眼几乎看不见。想象一下，当发现那两个小巧玲珑的器官一夜之间变得像鞋刷那么长，他是什么样的感受吧！

他去找镜子，但没有找到任何镜子，就往洗脸盆里倒满水，去看自己。他在盆里看到了他永远不希望看到的东西，他看见他的影子头上添了一对妙不可言的驴耳朵。

想一下，可怜的匹诺曹是多么伤心、羞耻和绝望啊！

他开始又哭又叫，用脑袋去撞墙，但他越是尖叫，耳朵越长，耳朵上的毛也越多。

听到刺耳的尖叫声，一只睡鼠来到屋里。这是一只小肥睡鼠，住在楼上。看到木偶伤心欲绝，它担心地问道：“怎么了，亲爱的小邻居？”

“我病了，小睡鼠，病得非常非常厉害——这病真让我害怕！你知道怎么把脉吗？”

“知道一点儿。”

“那给我把把脉，告诉我，看看我有没有发烧。”

睡鼠用爪子夹住匹诺曹的手腕，过了一会儿，伤心地抬起头说：“我的朋友，对不起，但我必须告诉你一个非常不幸的消息。”

“什么消息？”

“你在发高烧。”

“可是，发的是什么高烧？”

“驴高烧。”

“我对那种高烧一无所知。”木偶回答说，开始完全明白他出了什么事。

“那我来告诉你。”睡鼠说，“要知道，不出两三个小时，你就不再是木偶，也不是男孩子了。”

“那我会是什么？”

“不出两三个小时，你就要变成一头真正的驴子，就像拉水果车去市场的驴子一样。”

“噢，我做了什么呀？我做了什么呀？”匹诺曹哭叫着，两手抓住两只长耳朵，生气地又拉又拽，好像这是别人的耳朵似的。

“我亲爱的孩子，”睡鼠回答说，想要让他振奋点儿，“现在为什么苦恼呢？覆水难收，你知道。命运已经判定，所有讨厌书本、学校和老师，整天玩乐的懒孩子，早晚会变成驴子。”

“这是真的吗？”木偶痛哭着问道。

“很抱歉这样说。现在眼泪没用。你以前早就该想到这一点！”

“可这不是我的错。相信我，小睡鼠，请你相信我，全都是灯芯的错。”

“这个灯芯是谁？”

“是我的一个同学。我想回家，我想听话，我想学习，我想学有所成，但灯芯对我说：‘你为什么要浪费时间学习呢？你为什么想上学呢？跟我去玩具国吧。到了那儿，我们就再不用学习了，可以开开心心从早玩到晚。’”

“那你为什么要听那个假朋友的建议呢？”

“为什么？我的小睡鼠，因为我是一个木偶——没头脑，没心肝。噢！只要我有一点儿心肝，就绝不会抛弃那个好心的仙女了。她曾那么爱我，对我那么好！现在，我不再是一个木偶了。我本该像我所有这些朋友一样成为一个真正的男孩子啊！噢，我要是碰见灯芯，我要叫他倒霉！我要骂他一通，骂他个狗血喷头！”

说完这一长段话，匹诺曹走到屋门口。但是，他走到屋门口时，想起了自己的驴耳朵，不好意思让大家看到，又退了回去，从一个架子上拿起一顶大棉帽戴在头上，然后狠狠地往下拉，一直拉到鼻尖那儿。

这样装饰完后，他才走出去，到处找灯芯。他在街上找，在广场上找，在戏棚里找，到处都找遍了，就是找不到灯芯。他见人就问，但谁也没有看到灯芯。绝望之中，他又回到灯芯家，他敲了敲门。

“是谁呀？”灯芯从里面问道。

“是我！”木偶回答说。

“等一会儿。”

过了整整半小时，门才打开。另一个意外在等着匹诺曹！只见他的朋友站在屋里，头上也戴着一顶大棉帽，也一直拉到鼻子底下。

匹诺曹看到那顶帽子，稍微心宽了些，暗自想道：“我的朋友肯定和我得的是同样的病！我不知道他是不是也在发驴高烧？”

但是，他装作什么也没有看到，微笑着问道：“你好吗，我亲爱的灯芯？”

“很好，就像一只住在一块意大利干酪里的老鼠。”

“是真的吗？”

“我为什么要对你撒谎？”

“对不起，我的朋友，可你为什么戴那么一顶棉帽盖住耳朵呀？”

“是医生吩咐的，因为我的一个膝盖疼。你呢，亲爱的木偶，你为什么戴一顶棉帽盖住鼻子呢？”

“也是医生吩咐的，因为我的一只脚擦伤了。”

“噢，我可怜的匹诺曹！”

“噢，我可怜的灯芯！”

说完这番话，他们俩尴尬地沉默了好一阵子。在此期间，两个朋友互相嘲笑着面面相觑。

最后，木偶用甜似蜜、柔如笛的声音对同伴说道：

“告诉我，灯芯，我亲爱的朋友，你是得了耳痛吗？”

“从来没有！你呢？”

“从来没有！不过，从今天早上起，我的一只耳朵就一直在折磨我。”

“我也是。”

“你也是？是哪只耳朵？”

“两只。你呢？”

“也是两只。我怕我们可能得的是同样的病。”

“我也怕。”

“你愿意帮我吗，灯芯？”

“很乐意！打心底里乐意。”

“你让我看看你的耳朵好吗？”

“为什么不？可是，在我让你看我的之前，我要看看你的，亲爱的匹诺曹。”

“不，亲爱的！先看你的，再看我的。”

“那好吧，”木偶说，“我们订个协定。”

“让我们听听这个协定。”

“让我们一起脱下帽子，好吗？”

“好。”

“那好，准备！”匹诺曹开始数道，“一！二！三！”

一说到三，两个男孩子都脱下帽子，扔到了半空中。

随后，发生了一幕让人难以相信的情景，但这却非常真实。匹诺曹和他的朋友灯芯一看到彼此遭遇同样的不幸，没有感到伤心和羞耻，而是开始相互取笑，最后他们突然放声大笑。

他们笑啊笑啊笑，一个劲儿地笑个不停。

可灯芯突然不再笑了，他摇摇晃晃，差点儿摔倒。他脸色惨白地转向匹诺曹说道：“救命啊，救命啊，匹诺曹！”

“怎么了？”

“噢，救救我！我再也站不住了。”

“我也站不住了。”匹诺曹叫道，笑声变成了哭声，身子摇摇晃晃。

他们一说完，就手脚并用趴在地上，开始满屋乱跑乱跳。他们跑着跑着，胳膊变成了腿，脸变长，变成了驴子脸，背上长满了长长的灰色的毛。

这够丢脸了，但最丢脸的时刻是两个可怜的家伙感觉自己长出了尾巴。他们既羞耻又伤心，开始哭叫，哀叹自己的命运。

但是，最后他们连抱怨叫苦也办不到了！他们发出的不是呻吟和哭叫，而是响亮的驴叫声：嗷！嗷！嗷！

这时候，外面传来了响亮的敲门声，一个声音对他们喊道：“开门！我是小矮人，是带你们到这儿来的车夫。马上开门，我说，不然你们就倒霉了！”





第三十三章


匹诺曹变成了驴子，被马戏班班主买走，班主教他各种把戏。驴子瘸了，被卖给了另一个人，这个人想用他的皮做一面鼓。



两个可怜的小家伙既伤心又沮丧，站在那儿面面相觑。

屋外，小矮人越来越不耐烦了，最后狠狠一脚踢开了门。他嘴边还是带着甜甜的微笑，看着匹诺曹和灯芯，说道：“干得好，孩子们！你们学驴叫，叫得很好，所以我马上就听出了你们的声音，就到这儿来了。”

听到这话，两头驴子羞愧地低下头，垂下耳朵，夹紧尾巴。

小矮人先是拥抱和爱抚他们，捋捋他们的毛皮，然后拿出马梳，一直梳到那些毛像玻璃一样闪闪发亮。他对这两个小动物的模样表示满意，给他们套上笼头，牵到离玩具国很远的集市上，希望卖个好价钱。

事实上，他没有等多长时间，买主就来了。灯芯被一个农夫买去了，这个农夫的驴子昨天死了。买匹诺曹的是一个马戏班的班主，他想教匹诺曹为观众们耍把戏。

现在你们明白那个小矮人的职业是什么了吧？这个可怕的家伙脸上闪着殷勤的光芒，满世界寻找男孩子。懒惰的男孩子、讨厌书本的男孩子、想离家出走的男孩子、厌倦学校的男孩子——所有这些男孩子都是他的乐趣和财富。

他把他们带到“玩具国”，让他们随心所欲地玩。等他们无所事事地玩几个月变成驴子后，他就把他们牵到集市上卖掉。不到几年，他就成了百万富翁。

灯芯怎么样了呢？我亲爱的孩子们，我不知道。我可以告诉你们，匹诺曹从第一天起就苦不堪言。

新主人把他牵进畜栏后，在槽里撒满了稻草，但匹诺曹尝了一口，就吐了出来。

随后，那个人在槽里撒满干草。但是，匹诺曹也不喜欢。

“啊，你也不喜欢干草？”他生气地叫喊道，“等着吧，我的宝贝驴子，我要教你不要那么挑剔。”

他马上拿来鞭子，狠狠地在驴腿上抽了一鞭。

匹诺曹痛得尖叫，他嚷嚷道：“嗷！嗷！嗷！我消化不了稻草！”

“那就吃干草！”主人回答说，他非常了解驴子。

“嗷！嗷！嗷！干草会让我头疼！”

“你大概以为我该喂你鸡鸭吧？”主人又问道，更加生气，又抽了匹诺曹一鞭。

匹诺曹挨了第二鞭，就变得安分守己，不再说话了。

之后，栏门关上了，匹诺曹独自待在里面。他好多个钟头没有吃东西了，他因饥饿而打起了哈欠。他打哈欠时，嘴张得像烤炉口一样大。

最后，因为在槽里找不到别的东西，他就尝起了干草，尝过后，他仔细嚼了嚼，闭上眼睛，咽了下去。

“这干草不错。”他自言自语说，“可是，我要是继续学习，该会多么幸福啊！现在，我就不会吃干草，而是吃上等的黄油面包了。没法子，忍着吧！”

第二天早晨，匹诺曹醒来时，在槽里找干草，但已经没有了。因为昨天夜里，都已经吃光了。

他尽力吃着稻草。他嚼着嚼着，大失所望地发现稻草的味道既不像米饭，也不像通心粉。

“忍着吧！”他一边嚼，一边重复道，“只要我的不幸能给不听话、不想学习的男孩子作为教训就好了！忍着吧！要有耐性！”

“确实要耐心！”正在此时，主人走进畜栏喊道，“我的小驴子，你大概以为我带你到这儿来，只是为了给你吃喝吗？噢，不！你是来帮我挣漂亮的金币的，你听到了吗？现在跟我来，我要教你跳跃、鞠躬，跳华尔兹和波尔卡舞蹈，还会教你拿大顶。”

无论喜不喜欢，可怜的匹诺曹都只好学所有这些不了解的玩意儿。但是，耗时三个月，身上挨了好多好多鞭后，主人才宣布他做得完美。

匹诺曹的主人宣布有惊人演出的这一天终于到来了。城里到处都贴着大字书写的如下公告：

今夜盛大演出

本团名角

和名马

跳跃献艺

名叫匹诺曹的

名驴

舞星

首次公开亮相

戏院将如同白昼

那天夜里，正如你可以充分想象的那样，开场前一小时，就座无虚席了。

前座、后座和边座都没有位子了，就是拿金子也买不到了。

戏院里挤满了各种年龄的男孩子和女孩子，他们都迫不及待地又跳又扭，想看到名驴跳舞。

当演出第一部分结束时，马戏班班主兼经理穿着黑上衣、长及膝盖的白色短裤和黑漆皮靴，出现在公众面前，用响亮、夸张的声音宣布：

“最尊敬的朋友们、女士们、先生们！

“你们卑微的仆人，这个戏院的经理，今晚亲自现身，就是要给你们介绍世界上最伟大、最著名的驴。在他短暂的一生中，这头驴曾经非常荣幸在所有欧洲大宫廷的国王、王后和皇帝面前表演过。

“我们感谢你们的关注！”

这番话赢得了好多笑声和掌声。当名驴匹诺曹出现在马戏场中时，掌声渐渐变成了雷鸣。只见他一身漂亮的盛装，背上套着闪闪发亮的新皮笼头，笼头上镶着亮锃锃的铜扣，耳朵上系着白色山茶花，鬃毛分成好多鬈毛，扎着红绸缎带和流苏，腰间束着金银大腰带，尾巴上装饰着五彩斑斓的缎带。他的确是一头漂亮的驴子！

经理介绍完他后，又补充了这些话：

“最尊敬的观众们！我今晚就不浪费你们的时间告诉你们，我在非洲的荒野发现他以来，我在试图驯服这只动物时曾经遭遇到的巨大困难了。我恳请你们观察一下他凶猛的眼神。几百年文明征服野兽使用的所有手段，都失败了。我最后不得不采取鞭子的温柔语言，使他服从我。然而，我用所有的善良都从来没有成功地获得过驴子的爱。他今天还是像我发现他那天一样野蛮。他还是害怕和讨厌我。不过，我已经在他的身上发现了一个伟大的可取之处。你们看到他额头上的这个隆起部位了吗？正是这个隆起部位，给了他跳舞和像人类一样敏捷用脚的伟大天赋。赞美他吧，先生们，你们自己欣赏吧。现在，我要让你们做我成功训导动物的法官。在离开你们之前，我想声明，明天晚上还有一场演出。要是万一下雨的话，那场伟大的表演将在明天上午十一点钟进行。”

经理鞠了一躬，然后转向匹诺曹，说道：“准备，匹诺曹！开始表演之前，先向观众们敬礼！”

匹诺曹顺从地双膝跪地，一直跪到经理叭地抽了一鞭，厉声喊道：“走！”

驴子站起来，开始绕场行走。过了一会儿，经理又叫道：“快步跑！”匹诺曹顺从地从走改为小步跑。

“飞跑！”于是，匹诺曹飞跑了起来。

“全速跑！”匹诺曹就撒腿全速跑了起来。

匹诺曹正像快马一样跑的时候，经理举起一只胳膊，朝空中开了一枪。

听到枪声，小驴子倒在地上，好像真的死了。

驴子在雷鸣般的掌声和叫好声中站了起来。

他抬起头，举目四望，看到前面的一个包厢里坐着一位美女，她的脖子上挂着一条长长的金链，金链上吊着一枚大奖章，奖章上画着一个木偶的像。

“那是我的像！那位美女是我的仙女！”匹诺曹认出她来，自言自语说。他非常高兴，想尽力大声叫喊：“噢，我的仙女！噢，我的仙女！”

但是，戏院里传来的不是人的声音，而是响亮的驴叫声，叫声又响又长，戏院里所有的观众——男男女女老老少少，尤其是那些孩子——都哄堂大笑。

这时，为了教训驴子当着观众面粗鲁大叫，经理用鞭子在他的鼻子上打了一下。

可怜的小驴子伸出长舌头，舔了好长时间鼻子，想努力舔去这种痛苦。

而当他抬起头向那个包厢看去时，让他伤心的是，仙女已经不见了踪影！

他感觉自己昏昏欲倒，热泪盈眶，开始痛哭了起来。然而，没有人明白，至少经理不明白，他叭叭地抽着鞭子，大声叫道：“好啊，匹诺曹！现在让我们瞧瞧，你能多么优美地跳圈。”

匹诺曹试了两三次，但每次到了圆环前面，他都想从圆环下面溜过去。第四次，班主瞪了他一眼，他跳了过去，但他跳时，后腿钩住了圆环，于是他在圆环那一边扑通一声跌倒在地，缩成一团。

等他站起来时，腿已经瘸了，他一瘸一拐地回到他的畜栏里。

“匹诺曹！我们要看匹诺曹！我们想看小驴子！”前排的那些男孩子叫道，对这个意外事件非常伤心。

那天晚上，谁也没有再见到匹诺曹。

第二天早晨，兽医——也就是动物医生——宣布说他后半辈子就瘸了。

“我要一头瘸驴干什么？”经理对马夫说，“把他牵到集市上卖了吧。”

走到广场时，他们马上找到了买主。

“这头小瘸驴，你要多少钱？”他问。

“四块钱。”

“我给你四分钱。别以为我买他是为了干活，我只是想要他的皮。他的皮看上去很结实，我可以用它为我自己做一面鼓。我是村里的乐队成员，我需要一面鼓。”

我亲爱的孩子们，你们可以想象一下，当匹诺曹听说他要变成一面大鼓时，是多么高兴啊！

买主付了四分钱，驴子转了手。新主人把他带到海边的一个高高的悬崖上，在他的脖子上吊上一块石头，用一根绳子绑住他的一条后腿，一把将他推进了水里。

匹诺曹马上沉了下去。新主人坐在悬崖上，等着驴子淹死，好剥他的皮，给自己做一面鼓。





第三十四章


匹诺曹被推进海里后，被鱼群吃掉，又一次变成了木偶。当他快游到陆地时，又被可怕的鲨鱼吞了下去。



驴子落进了海里，越沉越深。最后，等了五十分钟后，坐在悬崖上的买主自言自语地说道：“这个时候，我那可怜的小瘸驴一定淹死了。我把他拉上来，然后就可以开始着手做漂亮的鼓了。”

于是他动手拉绑住驴子一条腿的那根绳子，拉啊拉啊拉，最后从水面上出来了——你们能猜出来是什么吗？他看到的不是一头死驴，而是一个活生生的木偶，像一条鳗鱼似的扭来扭去。

看到那个木偶，可怜的买主还以为是在做梦，坐在那儿，嘴巴大张，眼睛都凸了出来。

镇定下来后，他说：“我推到海里的驴子呢？”

“我就是那头驴子啊！”木偶笑着回答说。

“是你？”

“是我。”

“啊，你这小骗子！你是拿我开玩笑吗？”

“拿你开玩笑？根本不是，亲爱的主人。我说的是真话。”

“可你刚才还是一头驴子，而现在站在我面前的却是一个木偶，这是怎么回事？”

“这也许是海水的作用。大海很爱开这种玩笑。”

“你当心点儿，木偶，当心点！别取笑我！要是我失去耐性，你就会倒霉的！”

“那好，我的主人，你想知道全部真相吗？你要是解开我这条腿上的绳子，我就都告诉你。”

老家伙非常好奇，很想知道事情的真相，马上解开了拴住匹诺曹一只脚的绳子。匹诺曹感觉自由得像空中的小鸟一样，开始讲起了自己的故事：

“你知道，从前，我是一个木偶，就像今天这样。有一天，我就要变成一个男孩子，一个真正的男孩子，但由于懒惰、憎恨书本，而且由于我听信坏同学的话，因此就从家里跑了出来。一个美丽的早晨，我醒来时，发现自己变成了一头驴子，长耳朵、灰皮毛，甚至还有一条尾巴！对我来说，那是多么可耻的一天啊！亲爱的主人，我希望你永远不要经历这样的事。我被牵到集市卖给了一个马戏班班主，他想让我跳舞、钻圈。一天夜里，演出时，我狠狠地摔了一跤，变成了瘸子。班主不知道拿一头瘸驴该怎么办，于是把我送到了集市上，你就买下了我。”

“的确是我买的！我为你花了四分钱。现在谁会把钱还给我呢？”

“可是，你为什么买我？你买我是要伤害我，是要杀我，是要把我做成一面鼓！”

“的确是！而现在我到哪儿再找一张皮呢？”

“别担心，亲爱的主人。这个世界上有好多驴子。”

“告诉我，没规矩的小坏蛋，你的故事讲完了吗？”

“还有一句话，”木偶回答说，“我就讲完了。买过我后，你把我带到这儿来要杀我。可是，你出于人道主义的同情心，把一块大石头拴在我的脖子上，把我推下海底。你真是太好、太善良了，你想让我忍受尽可能少的痛苦，我将会永远记住你。而现在我的仙女将会照顾我，即使你——”

“你的仙女？她是谁？”

“她是我的妈妈，她像所有爱自己孩子的妈妈一样。即使我不值得爱护，她也从来没有忘记我。今天，我这个好心的仙女一看到我有被淹死的危险，就派了上千条鱼游到我身边。它们以为我真是一头死驴子，就开始吃我。它们咬的口可真大啊！有的吃我的耳朵，有的吃我的鼻子，有的吃我的脖子和鬃毛，有的吃我的腿，有的吃我的背……有一条小鱼非常温和礼貌，对我特别关照，吃起了我的尾巴。”

“从现在起，”买主嫌恶地说，“我发誓我再也不吃鱼了。剖开一条胭脂鱼或鲑鱼，发现有条死驴尾巴，那是多么糟糕啊！”

“我和你想的一样，”木偶笑着回答说，“我再对你说，这些鱼吃完我身上的驴皮，自然就吃到我的骨头，或者更准确地说，吃到木头，因为你知道，我是用很硬的木头做的。可是，咬了几口，那些贪吃的鱼发现木头咬不动，而且它们害怕会消化不良，于是连一句谢谢也没有对我说，就转身向四处游走了。亲爱的主人，这就是我告诉你的故事。你现在明白，为什么你从水里拽上来的是木偶而不是死驴了吧？”

“我才不要听你的故事呢！”买主生气地叫道，“要知道我买你花了四分钱，我想把钱要回来。你知道我怎么办吗？我要再次把你牵到集市上当干柴卖掉。”

“很好，卖我吧，我很高兴。”匹诺曹说。

但是，他说完飞身一跳，跳进了海里，尽可能快地游离海岸，笑着大声叫道：“再见，主人。要是你需要一张皮做鼓，就记住我哟。”

他游啊游。过了一会儿，他又转过身来，声音比先前更响地叫道：“再见，主人。要是你需要好干柴，就记住我。”

不一会儿，他就已经游出很远，几乎看不见了，所能看到的只是在蓝色海面上飞速移动的一个非常小的黑点。这个小黑点不时地把腿或手臂抬向空中。有人还以为匹诺曹已经变成了一只在太阳下嬉戏的鼠海豚呢。

游了好长时间后，匹诺曹看到大海当中有一块大礁石，像大理石一样雪白的礁石。高高的礁石顶上站着一只小山羊，山羊咩咩叫着喊着示意匹诺曹到它身边来。

非常奇怪的是，那只小山羊的毛不像其他山羊那样颜色是白的、黑的或褐的，而是天蓝的，那种闪亮的天蓝色使他想起了可爱仙女的头发。

匹诺曹心跳加快，随后越来越快。他又加了一把劲，朝雪白的礁石奋力游去。他快游到一半时，突然一个可怕的海怪从水里伸出头来。海怪的头非常大，张着血盆大口，露出了三排闪着寒光的牙齿，只看一眼就会让人心惊胆战。

你们知道这是什么吗？

那个海怪正是大鲨鱼，咱们这个故事里经常提起它，因为它残忍，所以鱼和渔民都给它起外号叫“大海的阿提拉”。

可怜的匹诺曹啊！看到那个怪物，他吓得要死！他想躲开海怪，换条路逃走，但那条大鱼的血盆大口越来越近了。

“匹诺曹，我求你快点儿！”小山羊在高高的礁石上咩咩叫道。

于是，匹诺曹用双臂、用身体、用腿和脚拼命地游。

“快，匹诺曹，怪物越来越近了！”

匹诺曹越游越快，越游越猛。

“加快，匹诺曹！怪物要抓住你了！它到了！它到了！快，快，要不你就没有命了！”

匹诺曹像一颗出膛的子弹一般游过水面，他游近礁石。山羊俯下身，伸出一只蹄子要帮他离开水面。

唉！太晚了。怪物追上了他。木偶感觉自己被夹在了三排寒光闪闪的白牙之间。然而，只停了一会儿，因为怪物深深一吸，就像吸鸡蛋似的轻而易举就把木偶吸进了嘴里。随后，鲨鱼很快就把匹诺曹吞了下去，匹诺曹落到了鱼肚子里，昏迷了半小时。

等醒来时，木偶想不起来自己是在哪儿。四周一片漆黑，一时间他还以为自己把头伸进了墨水池里呢。他听了一会儿，什么也听不到。偶尔一股寒风吹在他的脸上。起先，他不明白风是从哪儿吹来的；但是，过了一会儿，他明白了风是从怪物的肺里吹来的。我忘了告诉你们，鲨鱼正患哮喘病，它一呼吸就像刮暴风似的。

匹诺曹起先想鼓起勇气，但一确信自己的的确确是在鲨鱼的肚子里时，就放声大哭起来。“救命！救命啊！”他哭喊道，“噢，我真可怜啊！难道没有人来救我了吗？”

“谁会救你，不幸的孩子？”一个吉他似的声音沙哑地说。

“谁在说话？”匹诺曹问，吓得浑身冰冷。

“是我，和你同时被鲨鱼吞下的一条可怜的金枪鱼。你是哪种鱼？”

“我和鱼没有关系。我是一个木偶。”

“你不是鱼，怎么让这个怪物吞下去了呢？”

“不是我让它吞，是它追上我，没有得到我的许可就把我吞了下去！现在我们在这黑暗中怎么办呢？”

“我想，就等鲨鱼把我们俩消化掉吧。”

“我可不想被消化掉！”匹诺曹大声叫着，开始哭了起来。

“我也不想，”金枪鱼说，“可是，我是个地地道道的哲学家，我认为要是生为一条鱼，那死在水里要比死在油锅里体面。”

“胡说八道！”匹诺曹嚷道。

“我就是这个意见，”金枪鱼回答说，“而且意见应当受到尊重。”

“可是，我想离开这个地方，我想逃走。”

“只要你能，那就逃吧！”

“吞下我们的这条鲨鱼很长吗？”木偶问。

“不算尾巴，它的身体差不多有两公里长。”

他们在黑暗中正说话时，匹诺曹仿佛看到远处有一点儿微光。

“那可能是什么呢？”他对金枪鱼说。

“是和我们一样在等着被鲨鱼消化掉的另一条可怜的鱼。”

“我想去见它。它可能是一条老鱼，说不定知道怎么逃出去。”

“祝你好运，亲爱的木偶。”

“再见，金枪鱼。”

“再见，木偶，祝你好运。”

“我什么时候再见你呢？”

“谁知道？还是别想这个好。”





第三十五章


匹诺曹在鲨鱼的身体里找到了谁？孩子们，读了这一章，你们就会知道。



匹诺曹向他的好朋友金枪鱼道过别后，就在黑暗中蹒跚而去，开始尽可能走向远处闪动的微光。

他走着走着，只觉得两脚踏在又油又滑的水池里，水散发出炸鱼一样浓烈的气味，使他觉得像在大斋期。

他越往前走，火光越亮越清晰。他走啊走，最后发现——发现了什么？我让你们猜一千次，我亲爱的孩子们，你们也别想猜出来！他发现一张小桌子，桌子上摆着吃的，一支点燃的蜡烛插在一个玻璃瓶里；桌边坐着一位像雪一样白的小老头，他正在吃活鱼。这些鱼扭来扭去，不时地从他的嘴里滑出来，逃向桌子下面的黑暗中。

见此情景，可怜的匹诺曹突然心花怒放，差点儿昏倒。他想笑，他想哭，他有千言万语想说，但他所能做的只是静立不动，结结巴巴，语无伦次。最后，他好不容易才欢叫出来，张开怀抱，扑过去抱住老人的脖子。

“噢，爸爸，亲爱的爸爸！我终于找到你了吗？现在我永远、永远、永远不再离开你了！”

“我的眼睛看到的是真的吗？”老人揉了揉眼，反问道，“你真的是我亲爱的匹诺曹吗？”

“是，是，是！就是我啊！看看我！你已经饶恕我了，对吗？噢，我亲爱的爸爸，你真好啊！想一想，我——噢，可你要是知道有多少不幸落在我的头上，我碰到了多少麻烦，该多好啊！请想一下，你那天卖掉自己的旧上衣，给我买识字课本，好让我上学，我却跑去看木偶戏，木偶戏班班主抓住我，想把我烧掉，去烤他那只小羊！后来，也是他给了我五枚金币，叫我带回家送给你。可是，我碰到了狐狸和猫，它们把我带到了红虾客栈，它们在那里狼吞虎咽。后来我独自离开了客栈，在林中遇到了两个杀人强盗。我跑，它们追，而且紧追不放，直到它们把我吊在一棵大橡树的树枝上。后来，天蓝色头发的仙女派了一辆马车救了我。医生看过我后说：‘要是他没有死，那他就肯定活着。’这时，我说了个谎，我的鼻子开始长了起来，它长啊长，一直长到我连房间都出不来了。随后，我跟狐狸和猫去奇迹宝地种那些金币。鹦鹉嘲笑我。我没有发现两千枚金币，什么也没有发现。法官听说我被偷了，就把我关进了牢房，让那些小偷开心。离开牢房后，我看到葡萄藤上有一串漂亮的葡萄。捕兽夹夹住了我。农夫给我套上了狗脖圈，让我当看家狗。等我抓住那些黄鼠狼，他发现我清白无罪时，就放走了我。一条尾巴喷烟的蛇放声大笑，笑得肚子上的一条血管破裂。于是我回到了仙女的家，可她已经死了。鸽子看到我哭，就对我说：‘我曾看到你的爸爸做了一只小船要去美洲找你。’我对它说：‘噢，我要是有翅膀就好了！’它对我说：‘你想到你的爸爸那儿去吗？’我说：‘也许想，可怎么去呢？’它说：‘骑到我的背上，我送你去那儿。’#我们飞了整整一夜。第二天早上，渔民们望着大海，哭道：‘有一个可怜人要淹死了。’我知道那就是你，因为是我的心这样告诉我的。我从岸边向你挥手——”

“我也认出了你，”杰佩托插话说，“我也想回到你的身边，可我怎么办呢？海水汹涌，白浪翻滚，打翻了小船。这时，一条可怕的鲨鱼游出了海面，它一看到我在水里，就马上向我游来，伸出舌头，然后一口把我吞了下去，容易得就像我是一颗巧克力薄荷糖似的。”

“你在这儿关多久了？”

“从那天到现在，都两年了——漫长乏味的两年，我的匹诺曹啊，这两年就像两个世纪一样长！”

“那你是怎么过的呢？你在哪儿找的蜡烛？还有点蜡烛的那些火柴，你是在哪儿找到的呢？”

“我这就原原本本告诉你。淹没我的小船的那场风暴，把一艘大船也淹没了。尽管海员们全都得救，但船沉到了海底。吞下我的这条可怕的鲨鱼也吞下了那艘大船。”

“什么？吞下了整艘船？”匹诺曹惊讶地问道。

“一口吞下。它唯一吐出来的东西就是主桅，因为主桅卡在了它的牙缝里。我真幸运，那艘船装的是肉、罐头食品、饼干、面包、一瓶瓶酒、葡萄干、干酪、咖啡、食糖、蜡烛和一盒盒火柴。由于这些恩赐，我才能快乐地活了整整两年，而现在，我在吃最后的面包屑。今天食橱里什么也没有了。你看到的这支蜡烛是最后一支。”

“那然后呢？”

“然后，我的宝贝，我们就要生活在黑暗中了。”

“那么，我亲爱的爸爸，”匹诺曹说，“我们不能浪费时间了，必须设法逃走。”

“逃走？怎么逃走？”

“我们可以逃出鲨鱼嘴，跳进海里。”

“你说得不错，但我不会游泳，我亲爱的匹诺曹。”

“这有什么关系？你可以爬到我的肩上。我是一个游泳高手，可以把你安全地带上岸。”

“你这是做梦，我的孩子！”杰佩托摇了摇头，微微苦笑着回答说，“你以为一米高的木偶有力气把我扛在肩上游泳吗？”

“试试看！不管怎样，要是我们注定要死，那至少我们要死在一起。”

匹诺曹二话不说，拿起蜡烛，走在前面照路，对爸爸说：“跟着我，不要怕。”

他们走了好长一段路，穿过鲨鱼的整个肚子，来到怪物的喉咙口时，停了一会儿，想等待适当时机逃出去。

我想要你们知道，这条鲨鱼年纪很大，正患哮喘病和心脏病，睡觉时只好张开嘴巴。正因为这样，当通过鲨鱼张开的嘴巴抬头望时，匹诺曹可以看到繁星点点的天空。

“我们逃跑的时候到了，”他转身对爸爸低声说道，“鲨鱼睡熟了。大海平静，夜明如昼。紧紧跟着我，亲爱的爸爸，我们马上就得救了。”

说干就干。他们顺着海怪的喉咙往上爬，一直爬到它硕大无比的嘴巴边，这时他们不得不踮起脚尖走，因为要是弄痒了鲨鱼的长舌头，它就可能醒来——那时他们会在哪儿呢？鲨鱼的舌头又宽又长，看上去就像一条乡村公路。正当两个逃亡者将要跳进海里时，鲨鱼突然打了个喷嚏。它打喷嚏时先要吸一口气，它一吸气，匹诺曹和杰佩托就被吸了回去，重新落到怪物的肚子里头，他们摔了个大跟头。

更糟的是，蜡烛灭了，父子俩被留在了黑暗中。

“现在怎么办？”匹诺曹一脸认真地问道。

“现在我们没命了。”

“为什么没命？把你的手给我，亲爱的爸爸，小心别滑倒！”

“你带我去哪儿？”

“我们必须再试一次。跟我来，不要怕。”

说着，匹诺曹拉住爸爸的手，一直踮着脚尖走，第二次爬上怪物的喉咙，然后走过整条舌头，跳过三排牙齿，在狠狠地一跳之前，木偶对爸爸说道：“爬到我的背上，紧紧抱住我的脖子，其他的一切我来办。”

杰佩托在儿子的肩上一坐好，匹诺曹就蛮有把握地潜入水里，游了起来。海面如油，月光朗照，鲨鱼继续酣睡，就连大炮也轰不醒它。





第三十六章


匹诺曹终于不再是木偶，他变成了男孩子。



“我亲爱的爸爸，我们得救了！”木偶叫道，“现在我们必须做的就是游到岸边，这不难。”

匹诺曹二话没说，飞快地游起来，想尽早努力游到岸边。突然，他觉得杰佩托浑身哆嗦，好像在发高烧。

他是冷得发抖，还是吓得发抖呢？谁知道啊，也许两者都有一点儿。但是，匹诺曹认为爸爸是害怕，就尽力安慰他说：“勇敢点儿，爸爸！过一会儿，我们就安全上岸了。”

“可是，那该死的海岸在哪儿？”小老头问道。他越来越担心，眯起了眼睛，就像裁缝穿针时的样子，“我在这儿四面八方都瞅遍了，只看到了大海和天空。”

“我看到了海岸，”木偶说，“记住，爸爸，我像猫一样，夜里比白天看得还清楚。”

可怜的匹诺曹假装心平气和，可事实上呢？事实上呢……事实上他已经开始感到泄气了。他渐渐无力，呼吸越来越困难。他觉得自己再也无法向前游了，可海岸还远着呢。

他又划了几下，然后转向杰佩托，有气无力地叫道：“救救我，爸爸！救救我，我要死了！”

父子俩眼看就要淹死，可这时候他们听到一个吉他似的声音从海里喊道：“谁出事了？”

“是我和我可怜的爸爸。”

“这声音我熟悉。你是匹诺曹。”

“一点儿不错。你呢？”

“我是金枪鱼，是你在鲨鱼肚子里的患难朋友。”

“那你是怎么逃出来的？”

“我是跟你学的，是你教给了我方法。你走以后，我也跟着逃出来了。”

“金枪鱼，你来得正是时候！小金枪鱼，就像爱你生的孩子们那样，救救我们吧，不然我们就没命了！”

“我非常愿意。你们俩抓住我的尾巴，我带你们走。只要一眨眼的工夫，你们就会安全上岸了。”

你可以想象到，杰佩托和匹诺曹接受了邀请。其实，他们没有抓住金枪鱼的尾巴，而是爬到了它的背上。

“我们太重了吗？”匹诺曹问。

“重？一点儿都不重，你们像海贝一样轻。”金枪鱼回答说。它像一匹两岁马那样高大。

到了岸边，匹诺曹第一个跳上岸，帮他爸爸也上了岸，随后转向金枪鱼，对它说道：“亲爱的朋友，你救了我的爸爸，我都不知道该说什么话来感谢你！让我拥抱你，以表示我对你永世不忘的感激之情。”

金枪鱼把鼻子伸出水面，匹诺曹跪在地上，无比亲热地吻了吻它的脸颊。受到这样真心真意的热爱，可怜的金枪鱼像孩子似的哭了，因为不习惯这样的柔情，它感到不好意思，就飞快地扑进了海里，不见了踪影。

这时，天已经亮了。

杰佩托虚弱得都快站不住了，匹诺曹向他伸出手来说道：“亲爱的爸爸，靠在我的臂上，我们走吧。我们慢慢地、慢慢地走，走累了，可以在路边歇一会儿。”

“那我们去哪儿？”

“去找一间房子或一间茅屋，到了那儿，人们会好心给我们一口面包吃，给我们一点儿稻草睡的。”

他们还没有走上一百步，就看到了两个丑八怪坐在一块石头上乞讨。

这就是狐狸和猫，但差不多谁也认不出它们来了，它们看上去可怜巴巴。猫装了好多年瞎子后，真的瞎了。狐狸又老又瘦，毛差不多掉光了，尾巴也没有了。原来，那个狡猾的贼穷困潦倒，有一天被迫卖掉了漂亮的尾巴换口饭吃。

“噢，匹诺曹，”狐狸带着哭声叫道，“施舍我们一点儿东西吧，求你了！我们年老、疲惫，还有病。”

“有病！”猫随声附和道。

“再见吧，假朋友！”木偶回答说，“你们骗过我一次，但你们永远再也骗不了我了。”

“相信我们！我们如今真的很穷，快要饿死了。”

“快要饿死了！”猫随声附和道。

“你们穷，是自作自受！记住这句古老的谚语：‘偷来的钱永远不会致富。’再见吧，假朋友。”

“可怜可怜我们吧！”

“可怜我们吧。”

“再见，假朋友。记住这句古老的谚语：‘坏小麦总是做出坏面包。’”

“不要抛弃我们啊。”

“抛弃我们啊。”猫随声附和道。

“再见，假朋友。记住这句古老的谚语：‘谁偷邻居的衬衣，谁死后就常常没有衬衣。’”

挥别它们后，匹诺曹和杰佩托继续平静地赶路，他们又走了百来步，看到树丛附近的一条长路尽头有一座稻草盖的小农舍。

“一定有人住在那个小棚屋里。”匹诺曹说，“我们去看一下吧。”

他们就走过去敲门。

“谁呀？”里面一个小小的声音说。

“是一个可怜的爸爸和一个更可怜的儿子，没吃没住的。”木偶回答说。

“拧一下钥匙，门就开了。”还是那个小小的声音说道。

匹诺曹拧了拧钥匙，门开了。他们进屋，环顾四周，没有看到一个人。

“噢，房子的主人在哪儿？”匹诺曹叫道，感到非常吃惊。

“我在这上面呢！”

父子俩抬头看天花板，只见一根梁上卧着那只会说话的蟋蟀。

“噢，我亲爱的蟋蟀！”匹诺曹礼貌地鞠了一躬说。

“噢，你现在叫我亲爱的蟋蟀，可你还记得当时你拿锤子想砸死我吗？”

“你说得对，亲爱的蟋蟀。你现在用锤子砸我吧！但不要伤害我可怜的老爸爸。”

“你们父子俩我都不会伤害。我只是想提醒你，很久以前你捉弄了我，现在我要告诉你，在这个世界上，只要可能，就要善良、有礼貌，那么在我们身处困境时，人家才会回报我们，对我们有礼貌。”

“你说得对，小蟋蟀，你说得再对不过了。我一定会记住你给我上的这一课。可是，你愿意告诉我，你是怎么买来这座漂亮的小房子的吗？”

“这座房子是一只可爱的蓝毛小山羊昨天送给我的。”

“那山羊到哪儿去了？”匹诺曹问。

“我不知道。”

“那它什么时候回来？”

“它永远不回来了。昨天，它伤心地哭着离开了，在我听来好像是说：‘可怜的匹诺曹，我再也看不到他了……鲨鱼这会儿肯定把他吃了。’”

“它真是这样说的吗？那就是她——就是——我亲爱的小仙女啊！”匹诺曹大声痛哭道。

哭了好一阵子后，他擦干眼泪，然后为老杰佩托铺了一张稻草床，让他躺到上面，并对那只会说话的蟋蟀说道：“告诉我，小蟋蟀，我到哪儿可以为我可怜的爸爸找一杯牛奶？”

“离这儿三块地的地方住着农夫约翰，他有几头奶牛。你去那儿，他会给你想要的东西。”

匹诺曹一路跑到了农夫约翰家里。农夫对他说道：“你要多少牛奶？”

“我要满满一杯。”

“一满杯牛奶价值一便士，先给我一便士。”

“我没有一便士。”匹诺曹回答说，既伤心又羞愧。

“非常糟糕，我的木偶，”农夫回答说，“非常糟糕。你没有钱，我就没有牛奶。”

“太糟了。”说着，匹诺曹就要走。

“等一下，”农夫约翰说，“也许我们可以达成协议。你知道怎么从井里提水吗？”

“我可以试试。”

“那你就去看到的那个井里汲一百桶水。”

“很好。”

“你汲完水后，我就给你一杯暖乎乎、甜滋滋的牛奶。”

“我非常愿意。”

农夫约翰把木偶领到井边，教他怎么汲水。匹诺曹马上尽他所知开始干了起来。但是，还没有汲够一百桶水，他就早已经筋疲力尽、大汗淋漓了。他有生以来还没有这么干过活呢。

“今天以前，”农夫说，“都是我的驴子帮我做，但今天那头可怜的牲口要死了。”

“你带我去看看它好吗？”

“行。”

匹诺曹一走进畜栏，就看到一头小驴子卧在墙角的稻草铺上，又饿又累，筋疲力尽。

匹诺曹仔仔细细看了好一阵子，然后自言自语说：“我认识那头驴子！我以前见过它。”

随后，他向驴子弯下腰，问道：“你是谁？”

听到这声问话，驴子睁开疲惫垂死的眼睛，用同样的驴子话回答说：“我是灯……芯……”

说完，它就闭上眼睛，一命呜呼了。

“噢，我可怜的灯芯。”匹诺曹低声说着，从地上拿起一些稻草，擦了擦眼睛。

“这头小驴你分文没花，却这么为它可惜？”农夫说，“那我应该怎么办呢——我可曾为它付了一大笔钱啊？”

“可是，你要知道，它是我的朋友。”

“你的朋友？”

“是我的一个同学。”

“什么？”农夫约翰突然哈哈大笑道，“什么？你在学校里有驴子做同学？你书读得有多好就可想而知了！”

听了这些话，木偶羞愧难当，他没有回答，接过一杯牛奶，回到了爸爸的身边。

从那天起，整整五个多月时间，匹诺曹每天天刚亮就起来，到农场汲水。他每天得到一杯热奶，送给可怜的爸爸。他的爸爸一天天强壮好转。但是，他对这些还不满意，又学会了编芦苇篮子，然后卖掉挣钱，他和他的爸爸用他挣来的钱维持生活。

除此之外，他还做了一把牢固结实的轮椅，天气晴朗、阳光灿烂时他就推爸爸出去兜兜风。

晚上，匹诺曹在灯光下学习。他用赚来的一些钱给自己买了一本缺了几页的二手书，并用这本书在很短的时间里学会了阅读。他写字用的是一根长棍，其中一端削成了又长又细的尖。没有墨水，他就用黑莓或樱桃汁。渐渐地，他的勤奋得到了回报。他不仅在学业上取得了成功，还在劳动上都取得了成功。这一天终于来临了，他把足够的钱凑在一起，让老父亲过得舒适和快乐。他还给自己攒了五十便士。他要用这笔钱给自己买一身新衣服。

有一天，他对他的爸爸说道：“我要到集市上给自己买一件上衣、一顶帽子和一双鞋。等回家时，我要穿得漂漂亮亮的，你准会以为我发财了呢。”

他又唱又笑，从房子里跑出来，踏上了通向村子的路。突然，他听到有人叫他的名字。他回头循声看去，看到一只大蜗牛从矮树丛中爬了出来。

“你不认识我了吗？”蜗牛说。

“好像认识又好像不认识。”

“你还记得和天蓝色头发仙女住在一起的那只蜗牛吗？你不记得有一天夜里它为你开门给你送吃的了吗？”

“我记得，全都记得。”匹诺曹叫道，“漂亮的蜗牛，快回答我，你把我的仙女留在哪儿了？她在做什么？她原谅我了吗？她还记得我吗？她还爱我吗？她离这儿远吗？我可以见她吗？”

面对一个接一个涌现出的所有这些问题，蜗牛还是那样平静地回答说：“我亲爱的匹诺曹，仙女病了，正躺在医院里。”

“躺在医院里？”

“是的，的确是。她遭到了烦恼和疾病的折磨，连用来买一口面包的一便士都没有。”

“真的吗？噢，我真难过！我可怜的、亲爱的小仙女！要是我有一百万，我会跑去统统送给她！可是，我只有五十便士，它们都在这儿。我本来正要去买一些衣服。给，都拿去吧，小蜗牛，把它们送给我的好仙女吧。”

“那你的新衣服怎么办？”

“那有什么要紧？为了能更多地帮助她，我想卖掉身上的这身破衣服。去吧，快点儿。过两天再到这儿来，我希望再给你一些钱！前不久，我才开始为我的爸爸效劳。现在我也必须得为我的妈妈效劳。我希望很快见到你。”

蜗牛一反它的老脾气，开始像夏天骄阳下的蜥蜴一样飞奔了起来。

匹诺曹回到家时，他的爸爸问他：“新衣服在哪儿？”

“我没有找到一件合身的，改天还得去看。”

那天夜里，匹诺曹不是十点钟上床睡觉，而是等到了半夜。他不是编了八只篮子，而是编了十六只篮子。

之后，他就上床睡觉了。睡着时，他梦见了仙女。她漂亮开心，面带微笑，吻了吻他，对他说：“好样的，匹诺曹！为了报答你的善心，我原谅你以前所有的淘气事。热爱并好好照顾年老生病父母亲的男孩子，应该受到表扬和疼爱，哪怕他们不会被当成听话和规矩的模范。继续好好干，你一定会幸福的。”

这时，匹诺曹醒了，他的眼睛睁得大大的。

让他吃惊和快乐的是，当他看到自己时，发现自己不再是一个木偶，而是已经成为一个活生生的真正的男孩子！他瞧了瞧四周，发现已经不是原来的稻草墙，而是一个漂亮的小屋。这是他见过的最漂亮的房间。他一下子从床上跳下来，观看身边立着的椅子。在那儿，他发现一套新衣服、一顶新帽子和一双鞋。

他一穿上衣服，就把双手伸进口袋，掏出了一个小皮夹。皮夹上写着下面这样的话：

天蓝色头发的仙女还给

她亲爱的匹诺曹五十便士

多谢他的好心。

木偶打开钱包一看，里面是五十枚金币！匹诺曹跑到镜子前面，他简直认不出自己来了。只见一个聪明伶俐的高个子男孩正望着他，机警深蓝的眼睛，深褐色的头发，快乐微笑的嘴唇。

周围是那样金碧辉煌，匹诺曹简直不知道自己在做什么。他揉了两三次眼睛，不知道自己是仍在睡觉还是醒着，最后确定自己是醒着的。

“那我的爸爸在哪儿？”他突然叫道。他跑进另一个房间，只见杰佩托站在那儿，一夜之间年轻了好多岁，他穿着干净整洁的新衣服，像清晨的百灵鸟一样兴高采烈。他又成了杰佩托师傅，干起了木雕，在努力做一个漂亮的画框，上面装饰着花朵、树叶和各种动物的头。

“爸爸，爸爸，出了什么事？快告诉我吧。”匹诺曹跑着跳上爸爸的脖子，大声问道。

“我们家的这种突然变化都是你的功劳，我亲爱的匹诺曹。”杰佩托回答说。

“我跟这有什么关系？”

“就是这个。当坏孩子变成了善良的好孩子，他们就会有使全家开心、重获幸福的威力。”

“原来的木偶匹诺曹藏在了哪儿？”

“在那儿。”杰佩托回答说。随后，他指向靠着一把椅子的一个大木偶，只见木偶脑袋歪到一边，两只胳膊耷拉着，两条腿弯曲着。

匹诺曹看了好久好久，然后心满意足地自言自语：“我当木偶时是多么荒唐可笑啊！现在我变成了真正的男孩子，又是多么高兴啊！”





THE ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO

Carlo Collodi





CHAPTER 1


How it happened that Mastro Cherry，carpenter，found a piece of wood that wept and laughed like a child．



Centuries ago there lived—

“A king！” my little readers will say immediately．

No，children，you are mistaken．Once upon a time there was a piece of wood．It was not an expensive piece of wood．Far from it．Just a common block of firewood，one of those thick，solid logs that are put on the fire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm．

I do not know how this really happened，yet the fact remains that one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old carpenter．His real name was Mastro Antonio，but everyone called him Mastro Cherry，for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry．

As soon as he saw that piece of wood，Mastro Cherry was filled with joy．Rubbing his hands together happily，he mumbled half to himself：

“This has come in the nick of time．I shall use it to make the leg of a table．”

He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood．But as he was about to give it the first blow，he stood still with arm uplifted，for he had heard a wee，little voice say in a beseeching tone：“Please be careful！Do not hit me so hard！”

What a look of surprise shone on Mastro Cherry's face！His funny face became still funnier．

He turned frightened eyes about the room to find out where that wee，little voice had come from and he saw no one！He looked under the bench—no one！He peeped inside the closet—no one！He searched among the shavings—no one！He opened the door to look up and down the street—and still no one！

“Oh，I see！” he then said，laughing and scratching his Wig．“It can easily be seen that I only thought I heard the tiny voice say the words！Well，well—to work once more．”

He struck a most solemn blow upon the piece of wood．

“Oh，oh！You hurt！” cried the same far-away little voice．

Mastro Cherry grew dumb，his eyes popped out of his head，his mouth opened wide，and his tongue hung down on his chin．

As soon as he regained the use of his senses，he said，trembling and stuttering from fright：

“Where did that voice come from，when there is no one around？Might it be that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child？I can hardly believe it．Here it is—a piece of common firewood，good only to burn in the stove，the same as any other．Yet—might someone be hidden in it？If so，the worse for him．I'll fix him！”

With these words，he grabbed the log with both hands and started to knock it about unmercifully．He threw it to the floor，against the walls of the room，and even up to the ceiling．

He listened for the tiny voice to moan and cry．He waited two minutes—nothing；five minutes—nothing；ten minutes—nothing．

“Oh，I see，” he said，trying bravely to laugh and ruffling up his wig with his hand．“It can easily be seen I only imagined I heard the tiny voice！Well，well—to work once more！”

The poor fellow was scared half to death，so he tried to sing a gay song in order to gain courage．

He set aside the hatchet and picked up the plane to make the wood smooth and even，but as he drew it to and fro，he heard the same tiny voice．This time it giggled as it spoke：

“Stop it！Oh，stop it！Ha，ha，ha！You tickle my stomach．”

This time poor Mastro Cherry fell as if shot．When he opened his eyes，he found himself sitting on the floor．

His face had changed；fright had turned even the tip of his nose from red to deepest purple．





CHAPTER 2


Mastro Cherry gives the piece of wood to his friend Geppetto，who takes it to make himself a Marionette that will dance，fence，and turn somersaults．



In that very instant，a loud knock sounded on the door．

“Come in，” said the carpenter，not having an atom of strength left with which to stand up．

At the words，the door opened and a dapper little old man came in．His name was Geppetto，but to the boys of the neighborhood he was Polendina，(1)on account of the wig he always wore which was just the color of yellow corn．

Geppetto had a very bad temper．Woe to the one who called him Polendina！He became as wild as a beast and no one could soothe him．

“Good day，Mastro Antonio，” said Geppetto．“What are you doing on the floor？”

“I am teaching the ants their A B C's．”

“Good luck to you！”

“What brought you here，friend Geppetto？”

“My legs．And it may flatter you to know，Mastro Antonio，that I have come to you to beg for a favor．”

“Here I am，at your service，” answered the carpenter，raising himself on to his knees．

“This morning a fine idea came to me．”

“Let's hear it．”

“I thought of making myself a beautiful wooden Marionette．It must be wonderful，one that will be able to dance，fence，and turn somersaults．With it I intend to go around the world，to earn my crust of bread and cup of wine．What do you think of it？”

“Bravo，Polendina！” cried the same tiny voice which came from no one knew where．

On hearing himself called Polendina，Mastro Geppetto turned the color of a red pepper and，facing the carpenter，said to him angrily：

“Why do you insult me？”

“Who is insulting you？”

“You called me Polendina．”

“I did not．”

“I suppose you think I did！Yet I KNOW it was you．”

“No！”

“Yes！”

“No！”

“Yes！”

And growing angrier each moment，they went from words to blows，and finally began to scratch and bite and slap each other．

When the fight was over，Mastro Antonio had Geppetto's yellow wig in his hands and Geppetto found the carpenter's curly wig in his mouth．

“Give me back my wig！” shouted Mastro Antonio in a surly voice．

“You return mine and we'll be friends．”

The two little old men，each with his own wig back on his own head，shook hands and swore to be good friends for the rest of their lives．

“Well then，Mastro Geppetto，” said the carpenter，to show he bore him no ill will，“what is it you want？”

“I want a piece of wood to make a Marionette．Will you give it to me？”

Mastro Antonio，very glad indeed，went immediately to his bench to get the piece of wood which had frightened him so much．But as he was about to give it to his friend，with a violent jerk it slipped out of his hands and hit against poor Geppetto's thin legs．

“Ah！Is this the gentle way，Mastro Antonio，in which you make your gifts？You have made me almost lame！”

“I swear to you I did not do it！”

“It was I，of course！”

“It's the fault of this piece of wood．”

“You're right；but remember you were the one to throw it at my legs．”

“I did not throw it！”

“Liar！”

“Geppetto，do not insult me or I shall call you Polendina．”

“Idiot．”

“Polendina！”

“Donkey！”

“Polendina！”

“Ugly monkey！”

“Polendina！”

On hearing himself called Polendina for the third time，Geppetto lost his head with rage and threw himself upon the carpenter．Then and there they gave each other a sound thrashing．

After this fight，Mastro Antonio had two more scratches on his nose，and Geppetto had two buttons missing from his coat．Thus having settled their accounts，they shook hands and swore to be good friends for the rest of their lives．

Then Geppetto took the fine piece of wood，thanked Mastro Antonio，and limped away toward home．

CHAPTER 3


As soon as he gets home，Geppetto fashions the Marionette and calls it Pinocchio．The first pranks of the Marionette．



Little as Geppetto's house was，it was neat and comfortable．It was a small room on the ground floor，with a tiny window under the stairway．The furniture could not have been much simpler：a very old chair，a rickety old bed，and a tumble-down table．A fireplace full of burning logs was painted on the wall opposite the door．Over the fire，there was painted a pot full of something which kept boiling happily away and sending up clouds of what looked like real steam．

As soon as he reached home，Geppetto took his tools and began to cut and shape the wood into a Marionette．

“What shall I call him？” he said to himself．“I think I'll call him PINOCCHIO．This name will make his fortune．I knew a whole family of Pinocchi once—Pinocchio the father，Pinocchia the mother，and Pinocchi the children—and they were all lucky．The richest of them begged for his living．”

After choosing the name for his Marionette，Geppetto set seriously to work to make the hair，the forehead，the eyes．

Fancy his surprise when he noticed that these eyes moved and then stared fixedly at him．Geppetto，seeing this，felt insulted and said in a grieved tone：

“Ugly wooden eyes，why do you stare so？”

There was no answer．

After the eyes，Geppetto made the nose，which began to stretch as soon as finished．It stretched and stretched and stretched till it became so long，it seemed endless．

Poor Geppetto kept cutting it and cutting it，but the more he cut，the longer grew that impertinent nose．In despair he let it alone．

Next he made the mouth．No sooner was it finished than it began to laugh and poke fun at him．

“Stop laughing！” said Geppetto angrily；but he might as well have spoken to the wall．

“Stop laughing，I say！” he roared in a voice of thunder．

The mouth stopped laughing，but it stuck out a long tongue．

Not wishing to start an argument，Geppetto made believe he saw nothing and went on with his work．

After the mouth，he made the chin，then the neck，the shoulders，the stomach，the arms，and the hands．

As he was about to put the last touches on the finger tips，Geppetto felt his wig being pulled off．He glanced up and what did he see？His yellow wig was in the Marionette's hand．

“Pinocchio，give me my wig！”

But instead of giving it back，Pinocchio put it on his own head，which was half swallowed up in it．

At that unexpected trick，Geppetto became very sad and downcast，more so than he had ever been before．“Pinocchio，you wicked boy！” he cried out．“You are not yet finished，and you start out by being impudent to your poor old father．Very bad，my son，very bad！”

And he wiped away a tear．

The legs and feet still had to be made．As soon as they were done，Geppetto felt a sharp kick on the tip of his nose．

“I deserve it！” he said to himself．“I should have thought of this before I made him．Now it's too late！”

He took hold of the Marionette under the arms and put him on the floor to teach him to walk．

Pinocchio's legs were so stiff that he could not move them，and Geppetto held his hand and showed him how to put out one foot after the other．

When his legs were limbered up，Pinocchio started walking by himself and ran all around the room．He came to the open door，and with one leap he was out into the street．Away he flew！

Poor Geppetto ran after him but was unable to catch him，for Pinocchio ran in leaps and bounds，his two wooden feet，as they beat on the stones of the street，making as much noise as twenty peasants in wooden shoes．

“Catch him！Catch him！” Geppetto kept shouting．But the people in the street，seeing a wooden Marionette running like the wind，stood still to stare and to laugh until they cried．

At last，by sheer luck，a Carabineer(1)happened along，who，hearing all that noise，thought that it might be a runaway colt，and stood bravely in the middle of the street，with legs wide apart，firmly resolved to stop it and prevent any trouble．

Pinocchio saw the Carabineer from afar and tried his best to escape between the legs of the big fellow，but without success．

The Carabineer grabbed him by the nose（it was an extremely long one and seemed made on purpose for that very thing）and returned him to Mastro Geppetto．

The little old man wanted to pull Pinocchio's ears．Think how he felt when，upon searching for them，he discovered that he had forgotten to make them！

All he could do was to seize Pinocchio by the back of the neck and take him home．As he was doing so，he shook him two or three times and said to him angrily：

“We're going home now．When we get home，then we'll settle this matter！”

Pinocchio，on hearing this，threw himself on the ground and refused to take another step．One person after another gathered around the two．Some said one thing，some another．

“Poor Marionette，” called out a man．“I am not surprised he doesn't want to go home．Geppetto，no doubt，will beat him unmercifully，he is so mean and cruel！”

“Geppetto looks like a good man，” added another，“but with boys he's a real tyrant．If we leave that poor Marionette in his hands he may tear him to pieces！”

They said so much that，finally，the Carabineer ended matters by setting Pinocchio at liberty and dragging Geppetto to prison．The poor old fellow did not know how to defend himself，but wept and wailed like a child and said between his sobs：

“Ungrateful boy！To think I tried so hard to make you a well-behaved Marionette！I deserve it，however！I should have given the matter more thought．”

What happened after this is an almost unbelievable story，but you may read it，dear children，in the chapters that follow．

CHAPTER 4


The story of Pinocchio and the Talking Cricket，in which one sees that bad children do not like to be corrected by those who know more than they do．



Very little time did it take to get poor old Geppetto to prison．In the meantime that rascal，Pinocchio，free now from the clutches of the Carabineer，was running wildly across fields and meadows，taking one short cut after another toward home．In his wild flight，he leaped over brambles and bushes，and across brooks and ponds，as if he were a goat or a hare chased by hounds．

On reaching home，he found the house door half open．He slipped into the room，locked the door，and threw himself on the floor，happy at his escape．

But his happiness lasted only a short time，for just then he heard someone saying：

“Cri-cri-cri！”

“Who is calling me？” asked Pinocchio，greatly frightened．

“I am！”

Pinocchio turned and saw a large cricket crawling slowly up the wall．

“Tell me，Cricket，who are you？”

“I am the Talking Cricket and I have been living in this room for more than one hundred years．”

“Today，however，this room is mine，” said the Marionette，“and if you wish to do me a favor，get out now，and don't turn around even once．”

“I refuse to leave this spot，” answered the Cricket，“until I have told you a great truth．”

“Tell it，then，and hurry．”

“Woe to boys who refuse to obey their parents and run away from home！They will never be happy in this world，and when they are older they will be very sorry for it．”

“Sing on，Cricket mine，as you please．What I know is，that tomorrow，at dawn，I leave this place forever．If I stay here the same thing will happen to me which happens to all other boys and girls．They are sent to school，and whether they want to or not，they must study．As for me，let me tell you，I hate to study！It's much more fun，I think，to chase after butterflies，climb trees，and steal birds' nests．”

“Poor little silly！Don't you know that if you go on like that，you will grow into a perfect donkey and that you'll be the laughingstock of everyone？”

“Keep still，you ugly Cricket！” cried Pinocchio．

But the Cricket，who was a wise old philosopher，instead of being offended at Pinocchio's impudence，continued in the same tone：

“If you do not like going to school，why don't you at least learn a trade，so that you can earn an honest living？”

“Shall I tell you something？” asked Pinocchio，who was beginning to lose patience．“Of all the trades in the world，there is only one that really suits me．”

“And what can that be？”

“That of eating，drinking，sleeping，playing，and wandering around from morning till night．”

“Let me tell you，for your own good，Pinocchio，” said the Talking Cricket in his calm voice，“that those who follow that trade always end up in the hospital or in prison．”

“Careful，ugly Cricket！If you make me angry，you'll be sorry！”

“Poor Pinocchio，I am sorry for you．”

“Why？”

“Because you are a Marionette and，what is much worse，you have a wooden head．”

At these last words，Pinocchio jumped up in a fury，took a hammer from the bench，and threw it with all his strength at the Talking Cricket．

Perhaps he did not think he would strike it．But，sad to relate，my dear children，he did hit the Cricket，straight on its head．

With a last weak “cri-cri-cri” the poor Cricket fell from the wall，dead！





CHAPTER 5


Pinocchio is hungry and looks for an egg to cook himself an omelet；but，to his surprise，the omelet flies out of the window．



If the Cricket's death scared Pinocchio at all，it was only for a very few moments．For，as night came on，a queer，empty feeling at the pit of his stomach reminded the Marionette that he had eaten nothing as yet．

A boy's appetite grows very fast，and in a few moments the queer，empty feeling had become hunger，and the hunger grew bigger and bigger，until soon he was as ravenous as a bear．

Poor Pinocchio ran to the fireplace where the pot was boiling and stretched out his hand to take the cover off，but to his amazement the pot was only painted！Think how he felt！His long nose became at least two inches longer．

He ran about the room，dug in all the boxes and drawers，and even looked under the bed in search of a piece of bread，hard though it might be，or a cookie，or perhaps a bit of fish．A bone left by a dog would have tasted good to him！But he found nothing．

And meanwhile his hunger grew and grew．The only relief poor Pinocchio had was to yawn；and he certainly did yawn，such a big yawn that his mouth stretched out to the tips of his ears．Soon he became dizzy and faint．He wept and wailed to himself：“The Talking Cricket was right．It was wrong of me to disobey Father and to run away from home．If he were here now，I wouldn't be so hungry！Oh，how horrible it is to be hungry！”

Suddenly，he saw，among the sweepings in a corner，something round and white that looked very much like a hen's egg．In a jiffy he pounced upon it．It was an egg．

The Marionette's joy knew no bounds．It is impossible to describe it，you must picture it to yourself．Certain that he was dreaming，he turned the egg over and over in his hands，fondled it，kissed it，and talked to it：

“And now，how shall I cook you？Shall I make an omelet？No，it is better to fry you in a pan！Or shall I drink you？No，the best way is to fry you in the pan．You will taste better．”

No sooner said than done．He placed a little pan over a foot warmer full of hot coals．In the pan，instead of oil or butter，he poured a little water．As soon as the water started to boil—tac！—he broke the eggshell．But in place of the white and the yolk of the egg，a little yellow Chick，fluffy and gay and smiling，escaped from it．Bowing politely to Pinocchio，he said to him：

“Many，many thanks，indeed，Mr．Pinocchio，for having saved me the trouble of breaking my shell！Good-by and good luck to you and remember me to the family！”

With these words he spread out his wings and，darting to the open window，he flew away into space till he was out of sight．

The poor Marionette stood as if turned to stone，with wide eyes，open mouth，and the empty halves of the egg-shell in his hands．When he came to himself，he began to cry and shriek at the top of his lungs，stamping his feet on the ground and wailing all the while：

“The Talking Cricket was right！If I had not run away from home and if Father were here now，I should not be dying of hunger．Oh，how horrible it is to be hungry！”

And as his stomach kept grumbling more than ever and he had nothing to quiet it with，he thought of going out for a walk to the near-by village，in the hope of finding some charitable person who might give him a bit of bread．





CHAPTER 6


Pinocchio falls asleep with his feet on a foot warmer，and awakens the next day with his feet all burned off．



Pinocchio hated the dark street，but he was so hungry that，in spite of it，he ran out of the house．The night was pitch black．It thundered，and bright flashes of lightning now and again shot across the sky，turning it into a sea of fire．An angry wind blew cold and raised dense clouds of dust，while the trees shook and moaned in a weird way．

Pinocchio was greatly afraid of thunder and lightning，but the hunger he felt was far greater than his fear．In a dozen leaps and bounds，he came to the village，tired out，puffing like a whale，and with tongue hanging．

The whole village was dark and deserted．The stores were closed，the doors，the windows．In the streets，not even a dog could be seen．It seemed the Village of the Dead．

Pinocchio，in desperation，ran up to a doorway，threw himself upon the bell，and pulled it wildly，saying to himself：“Someone will surely answer that！”

He was right．An old man in a nightcap opened the window and looked out．He called down angrily：

“What do you want at this hour of night？”

“Will you be good enough to give me a bit of bread？I am hungry．”

“Wait a minute and I'll come right back，” answered the old fellow，thinking he had to deal with one of those boys who love to roam around at night ringing people's bells while they are peacefully asleep．

After a minute or two，the same voice cried：

“Get under the window and hold out your hat！”

Pinocchio had no hat，but he managed to get under the window just in time to feel a shower of ice-cold water pour down on his poor wooden head，his shoulders，and over his whole body．

He returned home as wet as a rag，and tired out from weariness and hunger．As he no longer had any strength left with which to stand，he sat down on a little stool and put his two feet on the stove to dry them．

There he fell asleep，and while he slept，his wooden feet began to burn．Slowly，very slowly，they blackened and turned to ashes．

Pinocchio snored away happily as if his feet were not his own．At dawn he opened his eyes just as a loud knocking sounded at the door．

“Who is it？” he called，yawning and rubbing his eyes．

“It is I，” answered a voice．

It was the voice of Geppetto．





CHAPTER 7


Geppetto returns home and gives his own breakfast to the Marionette．



The poor Marionette，who was still half asleep，had not yet found out that his two feet were burned and gone．As soon as he heard his Father's voice，he jumped up from his seat to open the door，but，as he did so，he staggered and fell headlong to the floor．

In falling，he made as much noise as a sack of wood falling from the fifth story of a house．

“Open the door for me！” Geppetto shouted from the street．

“Father，dear Father，I can't，” answered the Marionette in despair，crying and rolling on the floor．

“Why can't you？”

“Because someone has eaten my feet．”

“And who has eaten them？”

“The cat，” answered Pinocchio，seeing that little animal busily playing with some shavings in the corner of the room．

“Open！I say，” repeated Geppetto，“or I'll give you a sound whipping when I get in．”

“Father，believe me，I can't stand up．Oh，dear！Oh，dear！I shall have to walk on my knees all my life．”

Geppetto，thinking that all these tears and cries were only other pranks of the Marionette，climbed up the side of the house and went in through the window．

At first he was very angry，but on seeing Pinocchio stretched out on the floor and really without feet，he felt very sad and sorrowful．Picking him up from the floor，he fondled and caressed him，talking to him while the tears ran down his cheeks：

“My little Pinocchio，my dear little Pinocchio！How did you burn your feet？”

“I don't know，Father，but believe me，the night has been a terrible one and I shall remember it as long as I live．The thunder was so noisy and the lightning so bright—and I was hungry．And then the Talking Cricket said to me，‘You deserve it；you were bad；’ and I said to him，‘Careful，Cricket；’ and he said to me，‘You are a Marionette and you have a wooden head；’ and I threw the hammer at him and killed him．It was his own fault，for I didn't want to kill him．And I put the pan on the coals，but the Chick flew away and said，‘I'll see you again！Remember me to the family．’ And my hunger grew，and I went out，and the old man with a nightcap looked out of the window and threw water on me，and I came home and put my feet on the stove to dry them because I was still hungry，and I fell asleep and now my feet are gone but my hunger isn't！Oh！—Oh！—Oh！”

And poor Pinocchio began to scream and cry so loudly that he could be heard for miles around．

Geppetto，who had understood nothing of all that jumbled talk，except that the Marionette was hungry，felt sorry for him，and pulling three pears out of his pocket，offered them to him，saying：

“These three pears were for my breakfast，but I give them to you gladly．Eat them and stop weeping．”

“If you want me to eat them，please peel them for me．”

“Peel them？” asked Geppetto，very much surprised．“I should never have thought，dear boy of mine，that you were so dainty and fussy about your food．Bad，very bad！In this world，even as children，we must accustom ourselves to eat of everything，for we never know what life may hold in store for us！”

“You may be right，” answered Pinocchio，“but I will not eat the pears if they are not peeled．I don't like them．”

And good old Geppetto took out a knife，peeled the three pears，and put the skins in a row on the table．

Pinocchio ate one pear in a twinkling and started to throw the core away，but Geppetto held his arm．

“Oh，no，don't throw it away！Everything in this world may be of some use！”

“But the core I will not eat！” cried Pinocchio in an angry tone．

“Who knows？” repeated Geppetto calmly．

And later the three cores were placed on the table next to the skins．

Pinocchio had eaten the three pears，or rather devoured them．Then he yawned deeply，and wailed：

“I'm still hungry．”

“But I have no more to give you．”

“Really，nothing—nothing？”

“I have only these three cores and these skins．”

“Very well，then，” said Pinocchio，“if there is nothing else I'll eat them．”

At first he made a wry face，but，one after another，the skins and the cores disappeared．

“Ah！Now I feel fine！” he said after eating the last one．

“You see，” observed Geppetto，“that I was right when I told you that one must not be too fussy and too dainty about food．My dear，we never know what life may have in store for us！”





CHAPTER 8


Geppetto makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet，and sells his coat to buy him an A-B-C book．



The Marionette，as soon as his hunger was appeased，started to grumble and cry that he wanted a new pair of feet．

But Mastro Geppetto，in order to punish him for his mischief，let him alone the whole morning．After dinner he said to him：

“Why should I make your feet over again？To see you run away from home once more？”

“I promise you，” answered the Marionette，sobbing，“that from now on I'll be good—”

“Boys always promise that when they want something，” said Geppetto．

“I promise to go to school every day，to study，and to succeed—”

“Boys always sing that song when they want their own will．”

“But I am not like other boys！I am better than all of them and I always tell the truth．I promise you，Father，that I'll learn a trade，and I'll be the comfort and staff of your old age．”

Geppetto，though trying to look very stern，felt his eyes fill with tears and his heart soften when he saw Pinocchio so unhappy．He said no more，but taking his tools and two pieces of wood，he set to work diligently．

In less than an hour the feet were finished，two slender，nimble little feet，strong and quick，modeled as if by an artist's hands．

“Close your eyes and sleep！” Geppetto then said to the Marionette．

Pinocchio closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep，while Geppetto stuck on the two feet with a bit of glue melted in an eggshell，doing his work so well that the joint could hardly be seen．

As soon as the Marionette felt his new feet，he gave one leap from the table and started to skip and jump around，as if he had lost his head from very joy．

“To show you how grateful I am to you，Father，I'll go to school now．But to go to school I need a suit of clothes．”

Geppetto did not have a penny in his pocket，so he made his son a little suit of flowered paper，a pair of shoes from the bark of a tree，and a tiny cap from a bit of dough．

Pinocchio ran to look at himself in a bowl of water，and he felt so happy that he said proudly：

“Now I look like a gentleman．”

“Truly，” answered Geppetto．“But remember that fine clothes do not make the man unless they be neat and clean．”

“Very true，” answered Pinocchio，“but，in order to go to school，I still need something very important．”

“What is it？”

“An A-B-C book．”

“To be sure！But how shall we get it？”

“That's easy．We'll go to a bookstore and buy it．”

“And the money？”

“I have none．”

“Neither have I，” said the old man sadly．

Pinocchio，although a happy boy always，became sad and downcast at these words．When poverty shows itself，even mischievous boys understand what it means．

“What does it matter，after all？” cried Geppetto all at once，as he jumped up from his chair．Putting on his old coat，full of darns and patches，he ran out of the house without another word．

After a while he returned．In his hands he had the A-B-C book for his son，but the old coat was gone．The poor fellow was in his shirt sleeves and the day was cold．

“Where's your coat，Father？”

“I have sold it．”

“Why did you sell your coat？”

“It was too warm．”

Pinocchio understood the answer in a twinkling，and，unable to restrain his tears，he jumped on his father's neck and kissed him over and over．





CHAPTER 9


Pinocchio sells his A-B-C book to pay his way into the Marionette Theater．



See Pinocchio hurrying off to school with his new A-B-C book under his arm！As he walked along，his brain was busy planning hundreds of wonderful things，building hundreds of castles in the air．Talking to himself，he said：

“In school today，I'll learn to read，tomorrow to write，and the day after tomorrow I'll do arithmetic．Then，clever as I am，I can earn a lot of money．With the very first pennies I make，I'll buy Father a new cloth coat．Cloth，did I say？No，it shall be of gold and silver with diamond buttons．That poor man certainly deserves it；for，after all，isn't he in his shirt sleeves because he was good enough to buy a book for me？On this cold day，too！Fathers are indeed good to their children！”

As he talked to himself，he thought he heard sounds of pipes and drums coming from a distance：pi-pi-pi，pi-pi-pi．．．zum，zum，zum，zum．

He stopped to listen．Those sounds came from a little street that led to a small village along the shore．

“What can that noise be？What a nuisance that I have to go to school！Otherwise…”

There he stopped，very much puzzled．He felt he had to make up his mind for either one thing or another．Should he go to school，or should he follow the pipes？

“Today I'll follow the pipes，and tomorrow I'll go to school．There's always plenty of time to go to school，” decided the little rascal at last，shrugging his shoulders．

No sooner said than done．He started down the street，going like the wind．On he ran，and louder grew the sounds of pipe and drum：pi-pi-pi，pi-pi-pi，pi-pi-pi ．．．zum，zum，zum，zum．

Suddenly，he found himself in a large square，full of people standing in front of a little wooden building painted in brilliant colors．

“What is that house？” Pinocchio asked a little boy near him．

“Read the sign and you'll know．”

“I'd like to read，but somehow I can't today．”

“Oh，really？Then I'll read it to you．Know，then，that written in letters of fire I see the words：GREAT MARIONETTE THEATER．”

“When did the show start？”

“It is starting now．”

“And how much does one pay to get in？”

“Four pennies．”

Pinocchio，who was wild with curiosity to know what was going on inside，lost all his pride and said to the boy shamelessly：

“Will you give me four pennies until tomorrow？”

“I'd give them to you gladly，” answered the other，poking fun at him，“but just now I can't give them to you．”

“For the price of four pennies，I'll sell you my coat．”

“If it rains，what shall I do with a coat of flowered paper？I could not take it off again．”

“Do you want to buy my shoes？”

“They are only good enough to light a fire with．”

“What about my hat？”

“Fine bargain，indeed！A cap of dough！The mice might come and eat it from my head！”

Pinocchio was almost in tears．He was just about to make one last offer，but he lacked the courage to do so．He hesitated，he wondered，he could not make up his mind．At last he said：

“Will you give me four pennies for the book？”

“I am a boy and I buy nothing from boys，” said the little fellow with far more common sense than the Marionette．

“I'll give you four pennies for your A-B-C book，” said a ragpicker who stood by．

Then and there，the book changed hands．And to think that poor old Geppetto sat at home in his shirt sleeves，shivering with cold，having sold his coat to buy that little book for his son！





CHAPTER 10


The Marionettes recognize their brother Pinocchio，and greet him with loud cheers；but the Director，Fire Eater，happens along and poor Pinocchio almost loses his life．



Quick as a flash，Pinocchio disappeared into the Marionette Theater．And then something happened which almost caused a riot．

The curtain was up and the performance had started．

Harlequin and Pulcinella were reciting on the stage and，as usual，they were threatening each other with sticks and blows．

The theater was full of people，enjoying the spectacle and laughing till they cried at the antics of the two Marionettes．

The play continued for a few minutes，and then suddenly，without any warning，Harlequin stopped talking．Turning toward the audience，he pointed to the rear of the orchestra，yelling wildly at the same time：

“Look，look！Am I asleep or awake？Or do I really see Pinocchio there？”

“Yes，yes！It is Pinocchio！” screamed Pulcinella．

“It is！It is！” shrieked Signora Rosaura，peeking in from the side of the stage．

“It is Pinocchio！It is Pinocchio！” yelled all the Marionettes，pouring out of the wings．“It is Pinocchio．It is our brother Pinocchio！Hurrah for Pinocchio！”

“Pinocchio，come up to me！” shouted Harlequin．“Come to the arms of your wooden brothers！”

At such a loving invitation，Pinocchio，with one leap from the back of the orchestra，found himself in the front rows．With another leap，he was on the orchestra leader's head．With a third，he landed on the stage．

It is impossible to describe the shrieks of joy，the warm embraces，the knocks，and the friendly greetings with which that strange company of dramatic actors and actresses received Pinocchio．

It was a heart-rending spectacle，but the audience，seeing that the play had stopped，became angry and began to yell：

“The play，the play，we want the play！”

The yelling was of no use，for the Marionettes，instead of going on with their act，made twice as much racket as before，and，lifting up Pinocchio on their shoulders，carried him around the stage in triumph．

At that very moment，the Director came out of his room．He had such a fearful appearance that one look at him would fill you with horror．His beard was as black as pitch，and so long that it reached from his chin down to his feet．His mouth was as wide as an oven，his teeth like yellow fangs，and his eyes，two glowing red coals．In his huge，hairy hands，a long whip，made of green snakes and black cats' tails twisted together，swished through the air in a dangerous way．

At the unexpected apparition，no one dared even to breathe．One could almost hear a fly go by．Those poor Marionettes，one and all，trembled like leaves in a storm．

“Why have you brought such excitement into my theater；” the huge fellow asked Pinocchio with the voice of an ogre suffering with a cold．

“Believe me，your Honor，the fault was not mine．”

“Enough！Be quiet！I'll take care of you later．”

As soon as the play was over，the Director went to the kitchen，where a fine big lamb was slowly turning on the spit．More wood was needed to finish cooking it．He called Harlequin and Pulcinella and said to them：

“Bring that Marionette to me！He looks as if he were made of well-seasoned wood．He'll make a fine fire for this spit．”

Harlequin and Pulcinella hesitated a bit．Then，frightened by a look from their master，they left the kitchen to obey him．A few minutes later they returned，carrying poor Pinocchio，who was wriggling and squirming like an eel and crying pitifully：

“Father，save me！I don't want to die！I don't want to die！”





CHAPTER 11


Fire Eater sneezes and forgives Pinocchio，who saves his friend，Harlequin，from death．



In the theater，great excitement reigned．

Fire Eater（this was really his name）was very ugly，but he was far from being as bad as he looked．Proof of this is that，when he saw the poor Marionette being brought in to him，struggling with fear and crying，“I don't want to die！I don't want to die！” he felt sorry for him and began first to waver and then to weaken．Finally，he could control himself no longer and gave a loud sneeze．

At that sneeze，Harlequin，who until then had been as sad as a weeping willow，smiled happily and leaning toward the Marionette，whispered to him：

“Good news，brother mine！Fire Eater has sneezed and this is a sign that he feels sorry for you．You are saved！”

For be it known，that，while other people，when sad and sorrowful，weep and wipe their eyes，Fire Eater，on the other hand，had the strange habit of sneezing each time he felt unhappy．The way was just as good as any other to show the kindness of his heart．

After sneezing，Fire Eater，ugly as ever，cried to Pinocchio：

“Stop crying！Your wails give me a funny feeling down here in my stomach and—E—tchee！—E—tchee！” Two loud sneezes finished his speech．

“God bless you！” said Pinocchio．

“Thanks！Are your father and mother still living？” demanded Fire Eater．

“My father，yes．My mother I have never known．”

“Your poor father would suffer terribly if I were to use you as firewood．Poor old man！I feel sorry for him！E—tchee！E—tchee！E—tchee！” Three more sneezes sounded，louder than ever．

“God bless you！” said Pinocchio．

“Thanks！However，I ought to be sorry for myself，too，just now．My good dinner is spoiled．I have no more wood for the fire，and the lamb is only half cooked．Never mind！In your place I'll burn some other Marionette．Hey there！Officers！”

At the call，two wooden officers appeared，long and thin as a yard of rope，with queer hats on their heads and swords in their hands．

Fire Eater yelled at them in a hoarse voice：

“Take Harlequin，tie him，and throw him on the fire．I want my lamb well done！”

Think how poor Harlequin felt！He was so scared that his legs doubled up under him and he fell to the floor．

Pinocchio，at that heartbreaking sight，threw himself at the feet of Fire Eater and，weeping bitterly，asked in a pitiful voice which could scarcely be heard：

“Have pity，I beg of you，signore！”

“There are no signori here！”

“Have pity，kind sir！”

“There are no sirs here！”

“Have pity，your Excellency！”

On hearing himself addressed as your Excellency，the Director of the Marionette Theater sat up very straight in his chair，stroked his long beard，and becoming suddenly kind and compassionate，smiled proudly as he said to Pinocchio：

“Well，what do you want from me now，Marionette？”

“I beg for mercy for my poor friend，Harlequin，who has never done the least harm in his life．”

“There is no mercy here，Pinocchio．I have spared you．Harlequin must burn in your place．I am hungry and my dinner must be cooked．”

“In that case，” said Pinocchio proudly，as he stood up and flung away his cap of dough，“in that case，my duty is clear．Come，officers！Tie me up and throw me on those flames．No，it is not fair for poor Harlequin，the best friend that I have in the world，to die in my place！”

These brave words，said in a piercing voice，made all the other Marionettes cry．Even the officers，who were made of wood also，cried like two babies．

Fire Eater at first remained hard and cold as a piece of ice；but then，little by little，he softened and began to sneeze．And after four or five sneezes，he opened wide his arms and said to Pinocchio：

“You are a brave boy！Come to my arms and kiss me！”

Pinocchio ran to him and scurrying like a squirrel up the long black beard，he gave Fire Eater a loving kiss on the tip of his nose．

“Has pardon been granted to me？” asked poor Harlequin with a voice that was hardly a breath．

“Pardon is yours！” answered Fire Eater；and sighing and wagging his head，he added：“Well，tonight I shall have to eat my lamb only half cooked，but beware the next time，Marionettes．”

At the news that pardon had been given，the Marionettes ran to the stage and，turning on all the lights，they danced and sang till dawn．





CHAPTER 12


Fire Eater gives Pinocchio five gold pieces for his father，Geppetto；but the Marionette meets a Fox and a Cat and follows them．



The next day Fire Eater called Pinocchio aside and asked him：

“What is your father's name？”

“Geppetto．”

“And what is his trade？”

“He's a wood carver．”

“Does he earn much？”

“He earns so much that he never has a penny in his pockets．Just think that，in order to buy me an A-B-C book for school，he had to sell the only coat he owned，a coat so full of darns and patches that it was a pity．”

“Poor fellow！I feel sorry for him．Here，take these five gold pieces．Go，give them to him with my kindest regards．”

Pinocchio，as may easily be imagined，thanked him a thousand times．He kissed each Marionette in turn，even the officers，and，beside himself with joy，set out on his homeward journey．

He had gone barely half a mile when he met a lame Fox and a blind Cat，walking together like two good friends．The lame Fox leaned on the Cat，and the blind Cat let the Fox lead him along．

“Good morning，Pinocchio，” said the Fox，greeting him courteously．

“How do you know my name？” asked the Marionette．

“I know your father well．”

“Where have you seen him？”

“I saw him yesterday standing at the door of his house．”

“And what was he doing？”

“He was in his shirt sleeves trembling with cold．”

“Poor Father！But，after today，God willing，he will suffer no longer．”

“Why？”

“Because I have become a rich man．”

“You，a rich man？” said the Fox，and he began to laugh out loud．The Cat was laughing also，but tried to hide it by stroking his long whiskers．

“There is nothing to laugh at，” cried Pinocchio angrily．“I am very sorry to make your mouth water，but these，as you know，are five new gold pieces．”

And he pulled out the gold pieces which Fire Eater had given him．

At the cheerful tinkle of the gold，the Fox unconsciously held out his paw that was supposed to be lame，and the Cat opened wide his two eyes till they looked like live coals，but he closed them again so quickly that Pinocchio did not notice．

“And may I ask，” inquired the Fox，“what you are going to do with all that money？”

“First of all，” answered the Marionette，“I want to buy a fine new coat for my father，a coat of gold and silver with diamond buttons；after that，I'll buy an A-B-C book for myself．”

“For yourself？”

“For myself．I want to go to school and study hard．”

“Look at me，” said the Fox．“For the silly reason of wanting to study，I have lost a paw．”

“Look at me，” said the Cat．“For the same foolish reason，I have lost the sight of both eyes．”

At that moment，a Blackbird，perched on the fence along the road，called out sharp and clear：

“Pinocchio，do not listen to bad advice．If you do，you'll be sorry！”

Poor little Blackbird！If he had only kept his words to himself！In the twinkling of an eyelid，the Cat leaped on him，and ate him，feathers and all．

After eating the bird，he cleaned his whiskers，closed his eyes，and became blind once more．

“Poor Blackbird！” said Pinocchio to the Cat．“Why did you kill him？”

“I killed him to teach him a lesson．He talks too much．Next time he will keep his words to himself．”

By this time the three companions had walked a long distance．Suddenly，the Fox stopped in his tracks and，turning to the Marionette，said to him：

“Do you want to double your gold pieces？”

“What do you mean？”

“Do you want one hundred，a thousand，two thousand gold pieces for your miserable five？”

“Yes，but how？”

“The way is very easy．Instead of returning home，come with us．”

“And where will you take me？”

“To the City of Simple Simons．”

Pinocchio thought a while and then said firmly：

“No，I don't want to go．Home is near，and I'm going where Father is waiting for me．How unhappy he must be that I have not yet returned！I have been a bad son，and the Talking Cricket was right when he said that a disobedient boy cannot be happy in this world．I have learned this at my own expense．Even last night in the theater，when Fire Eater．．．Brrrr！！！！！．．．The shivers run up and down my back at the mere thought of it．”

“Well，then，” said the Fox，“if you really want to go home，go ahead，but you'll be sorry．”

“You'll be sorry，” repeated the Cat．

“Think well，Pinocchio，you are turning your back on Dame Fortune．”

“On Dame Fortune，” repeated the Cat．

“Tomorrow your five gold pieces will be two thousand！”

“Two thousand！” repeated the Cat．

“But how can they possibly become so many？” asked Pinocchio wonderingly．

“I'll explain，” said the Fox．“You must know that，just outside the City of Simple Simons，there is a blessed field called the Field of Wonders．In this field you dig a hole and in the hole you bury a gold piece．After covering up the hole with earth you water it well，sprinkle a bit of salt on it，and go to bed．During the night，the gold piece sprouts，grows，blossoms，and next morning you find a beautiful tree，that is loaded with gold pieces．”

“So that if I were to bury my five gold pieces，” cried Pinocchio with growing wonder，“next morning I should find—how many？”

“It is very simple to figure out，” answered the Fox．“Why，you can figure it on your fingers！Granted that each piece gives you five hundred，multiply five hundred by five．Next morning you will find twenty-five hundred new，sparkling gold pieces．”

“Fine！Fine！” cried Pinocchio，dancing about with joy．“And as soon as I have them，I shall keep two thousand for myself and the other five hundred I'll give to you two．”

“A gift for us？” cried the Fox，pretending to be insulted．“Why，of course not！”

“Of course not！” repeated the Cat．

“We do not work for gain，” answered the Fox．“We work only to enrich others．”

“To enrich others！” repeated the Cat．

“What good people，” thought Pinocchio to himself．And forgetting his father，the new coat，the A-B-C book，and all his good resolutions，he said to the Fox and to the Cat：

“Let us go．I am with you．”





CHAPTER 13


The Inn of the Red Lobster．



Cat and Fox and Marionette walked and walked and walked．At last，toward evening，dead tired，they came to the Inn of the Red Lobster．

“Let us stop here a while，” said the Fox，“to eat a bite and rest for a few hours．At midnight we'll start out again，for at dawn tomorrow we must be at the Field of Wonders．”

They went into the Inn and all three sat down at the same table．However，not one of them was very hungry．

The poor Cat felt very weak，and he was able to eat only thirty-five mullets with tomato sauce and four portions of tripe with cheese．Moreover，as he was so in need of strength，he had to have four more helpings of butter and cheese．

The Fox，after a great deal of coaxing，tried his best to eat a little．The doctor had put him on a diet，and he had to be satisfied with a small hare dressed with a dozen young and tender spring chickens．After the hare，he ordered some partridges，a few pheasants，a couple of rabbits，and a dozen frogs and lizards．That was all．He felt ill，he said，and could not eat another bite．

Pinocchio ate least of all．He asked for a bite of bread and a few nuts and then hardly touched them．The poor fellow，with his mind on the Field of Wonders，was suffering from a gold-piece indigestion．

Supper over，the Fox said to the Innkeeper：

“Give us two good rooms，one for Mr．Pinocchio and the other for me and my friend．Before starting out，we'll take a little nap．Remember to call us at midnight sharp，for we must continue on our journey．”

“Yes，sir，” answered the Innkeeper，winking in a knowing way at the Fox and the Cat，as if to say，“I understand．”

As soon as Pinocchio was in bed，he fell fast asleep and began to dream．He dreamed he was in the middle of a field．The field was full of vines heavy with grapes．The grapes were no other than gold coins which tinkled merrily as they swayed in the wind．They seemed to say，“Let him who wants us take us！”

Just as Pinocchio stretched out his hand to take a handful of them，he was awakened by three loud knocks at the door．It was the Innkeeper who had come to tell him that midnight had struck．

“Are my friends ready？” the Marionette asked him．

“Indeed，yes！They went two hours ago．”

“Why in such a hurry？”

“Unfortunately the Cat received a telegram which said that his first-born was suffering from chilblains and was on the point of death．He could not even wait to say good-by to you．”

“Did they pay for the supper？”

“How could they do such a thing？Being people of great refinement，they did not want to offend you so deeply as not to allow you the honor of paying the bill．”

“Too bad！That offense would have been more than pleasing to me，” said Pinocchio，scratching his head．

“Where did my good friends say they would wait for me？” he added．

“At the Field of Wonders，at sunrise tomorrow morning．”

Pinocchio paid a gold piece for the three suppers and started on his way toward the field that was to make him a rich man．

He walked on，not knowing where he was going，for it was dark，so dark that not a thing was visible．Round about him，not a leaf stirred．A few bats skimmed his nose now and again and scared him half to death．Once or twice he shouted，“Who goes there？” and the far-away hills echoed back to him，“Who goes there？Who goes there？Who goes．．．？”

As he walked，Pinocchio noticed a tiny insect glimmering on the trunk of a tree，a small being that glowed with a pale，soft light．

“Who are you？” he asked．

“I am the ghost of the Talking Cricket，” answered the little being in a faint voice that sounded as if it came from a far-away world．

“What do you want？” asked the Marionette．

“I want to give you a few words of good advice．Return home and give the four gold pieces you have left to your poor old father who is weeping because he has not seen you for many a day．”

“Tomorrow my father will be a rich man，for these four gold pieces will become two thousand．”

“Don't listen to those who promise you wealth overnight，my boy．As a rule they are either fools or swindlers！Listen to me and go home．”

“But I want to go on！”

“The hour is late！”

“I want to go on．”

“The night is very dark．”

“I want to go on．”

“The road is dangerous．”

“I want to go on．”

“Remember that boys who insist on having their own way，sooner or later come to grief．”

“The same nonsense．Good-by，Cricket．”

“Good night，Pinocchio，and may Heaven preserve you from the Assassins．”

There was silence for a minute and the light of the Talking Cricket disappeared suddenly，just as if someone had snuffed it out．Once again the road was plunged in darkness．





CHAPTER 14


Pinocchio，not having listened to the good advice of the Talking Cricket，falls into the hands of the Assassins．



“Dear，oh，dear！When I come to think of it，” said the Marionette to himself，as he once more set out on his journey，“we boys are really very unlucky．Everybody scolds us，everybody gives us advice，everybody warns us．If we were to allow it，everyone would try to be father and mother to us；everyone，even the Talking Cricket．Take me，for example．Just because I would not listen to that bothersome Cricket，who knows how many misfortunes may be awaiting me！Assassins indeed！At least I have never believed in them，nor ever will．To speak sensibly，I think assassins have been invented by fathers and mothers to frighten children who want to run away at night．And then，even if I were to meet them on the road，what matter？I'll just run up to them，and say，‘Well，signori，what do you want？Remember that you can't fool with me！Run along and mind your business．’ At such a speech，I can almost see those poor fellows running like the wind．But in case they don't run away，I can always run myself ．．．”

Pinocchio was not given time to argue any longer，for he thought he heard a slight rustle among the leaves behind him．

He turned to look and behold，there in the darkness stood two big black shadows，wrapped from head to foot in black sacks．The two figures leaped toward him as softly as if they were ghosts．

“Here they come！” Pinocchio said to himself，and，not knowing where to hide the gold pieces，he stuck all four of them under his tongue．

He tried to run away，but hardly had he taken a step，when he felt his arms grasped and heard two horrible，deep voices say to him：“Your money or your life！”

On account of the gold pieces in his mouth，Pinocchio could not say a word，so he tried with head and hands and body to show，as best he could，that he was only a poor Marionette without a penny in his pocket．

“Come，come，less nonsense，and out with your money！” cried the two thieves in threatening voices．

Once more，Pinocchio's head and hands said，“I haven't a penny．”

“Out with that money or you're a dead man，” said the taller of the two Assassins．

“Dead man，” repeated the other．

“And after having killed you，we will kill your father also．”

“Your father also！”

“No，no，no，not my Father！” cried Pinocchio，wild with terror；but as he screamed，the gold pieces tinkled together in his mouth．

“Ah，you rascal！So that's the game！You have the money hidden under your tongue．Out with it！”

But Pinocchio was as stubborn as ever．

“Are you deaf？Wait，young man，we'll get it from you in a twinkling！”

One of them grabbed the Marionette by the nose and the other by the chin，and they pulled him unmercifully from side to side in order to make him open his mouth．

All was of no use．The Marionette's lips might have been nailed together．They would not open．

In desperation the smaller of the two Assassins pulled out a long knife from his pocket，and tried to pry Pinocchio's mouth open with it．

Quick as a flash，the Marionette sank his teeth deep into the Assassin's hand，bit it off and spat it out．Fancy his surprise when he saw that it was not a hand，but a cat's paw．

Encouraged by this first victory，he freed himself from the claws of his assailers and，leaping over the bushes along the road，ran swiftly across the fields．His pursuers were after him at once，like two dogs chasing a hare．

After running seven miles or so，Pinocchio was well-nigh exhausted．Seeing himself lost，he climbed up a giant pine tree and sat there to see what he could see．The Assassins tried to climb also，but they slipped and fell．

Far from giving up the chase，this only spurred them on．They gathered a bundle of wood，piled it up at the foot of the pine，and set fire to it．In a twinkling the tree began to sputter and burn like a candle blown by the wind．Pinocchio saw the flames climb higher and higher．Not wishing to end his days as a roasted Marionette，he jumped quickly to the ground and off he went，the Assassins close to him，as before．

Dawn was breaking when，without any warning whatsoever，Pinocchio found his path barred by a deep pool full of water the color of muddy coffee．

What was there to do？With a “One，two，three！” he jumped clear across it．The Assassins jumped also，but not having measured their distance well—splash！！！—they fell right into the middle of the pool．Pinocchio who heard the splash and felt it，too，cried out，laughing，but never stopping in his race：

“A pleasant bath to you，signori！”

He thought they must surely be drowned and turned his head to see．But there were the two somber figures still following him，though their black sacks were drenched and dripping with water．





CHAPTER 15


The Assassins chase Pinocchio，catch him，and hang him to the branch of a giant oak tree．



As he ran，the Marionette felt more and more certain that he would have to give himself up into the hands of his pursuers．Suddenly he saw a little cottage gleaming white as the snow among the trees of the forest．

“If I have enough breath left with which to reach that little house，I may be saved，” he said to himself．

Not waiting another moment，he darted swiftly through the woods，the Assassins still after him．

After a hard race of almost an hour，tired and out of breath，Pinocchio finally reached the door of the cottage and knocked．No one answered．

He knocked again，harder than before，for behind him he heard the steps and the labored breathing of his persecutors．The same silence followed．

As knocking was of no use，Pinocchio，in despair，began to kick and bang against the door，as if he wanted to break it．At the noise，a window opened and a lovely maiden looked out．She had azure hair and a face white as wax．Her eyes were closed and her hands crossed on her breast．With a voice so weak that it hardly could be heard，she whispered：

“No one lives in this house．Everyone is dead．”

“Won't you，at least，open the door for me？” cried Pinocchio in a beseeching voice．

“I also am dead．”

“Dead？What are you doing at the window，then？”

“I am waiting for the coffin to take me away．”

After these words，the little girl disappeared and the window closed without a sound．

“Oh，Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair，” cried Pinocchio，“open，I beg of you．Take pity on a poor boy who is being chased by two Assass—”

He did not finish，for two powerful hands grasped him by the neck and the same two horrible voices growled threateningly：“Now we have you！”

The Marionette，seeing death dancing before him，trembled so hard that the joints of his legs rattled and the coins tinkled under his tongue．

“Well，” the Assassins asked，“will you open your mouth now or not？Ah！You do not answer？Very well，this time you shall open it．”

Taking out two long，sharp knives，they struck two heavy blows on the Marionette's back．

Happily for him，Pinocchio was made of very hard wood and the knives broke into a thousand pieces．The Assassins looked at each other in dismay，holding the handles of the knives in their hands．

“I understand，” said one of them to the other，“there is nothing left to do now but to hang him．”

“To hang him，” repeated the other．

They tied Pinocchio's hands behind his shoulders and slipped the noose around his neck．Throwing the rope over the high limb of a giant oak tree，they pulled till the poor Marionette hung far up in space．

Satisfied with their work，they sat on the grass waiting for Pinocchio to give his last gasp．But after three hours the Marionette's eyes were still open，his mouth still shut and his legs kicked harder than ever．

Tired of waiting，the Assassins called to him mockingly：“Good-by till tomorrow．When we return in the morning，we hope you'll be polite enough to let us find you dead and gone and with your mouth wide open．” With these words they went．

A few minutes went by and then a wild wind started to blow．As it shrieked and moaned，the poor little sufferer was blown to and fro like the hammer of a bell．The rocking made him seasick and the noose，becoming tighter and tighter，choked him．Little by little a film covered his eyes．

Death was creeping nearer and nearer，and the Marionette still hoped for some good soul to come to his rescue，but no one appeared．As he was about to die，he thought of his poor old father，and hardly conscious of what he was saying，murmured to himself：

“Oh，Father，dear Father！If you were only here！”

These were his last words．He closed his eyes，opened his mouth，stretched out his legs，and hung there，as if he were dead．





CHAPTER 16


The Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair sends for the poor Marionette，puts him to bed，and calls three Doctors to tell her if Pinocchio is dead or alive．



If the poor Marionette had dangled there much longer，all hope would have been lost．Luckily for him，the Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair once again looked out of her window．Filled with pity at the sight of the poor little fellow being knocked helplessly about by the wind，she clapped her hands sharply together three times．

At the signal，a loud whirr of wings in quick flight was heard and a large Falcon came and settled itself on the window ledge．

“What do you command，my charming Fairy？”asked the Falcon，bending his beak in deep reverence（for it must be known that，after all，the Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair was none other than a very kind Fairy who had lived，for more than a thousand years，in the vicinity of the forest）．

“Do you see that Marionette hanging from the limb of that giant oak tree？”

“I see him．”

“Very well．Fly immediately to him．With your strong beak，break the knot which holds him tied，take him down，and lay him softly on the grass at the foot of the oak．”

The Falcon flew away and after two minutes returned，saying，“I have done what you have commanded．”

“How did you find him？Alive or dead？”

“At first glance，I thought he was dead．But I found I was wrong，for as soon as I loosened the knot around his neck，he gave a long sigh and mumbled with a faint voice，‘Now I feel better！’”

The Fairy clapped her hands twice．A magnificent Poodle appeared，walking on his hind legs just like a man．He was dressed in court livery．A tricorn trimmed with gold lace was set at a rakish angle over a wig of white curls that dropped down to his waist．He wore a jaunty coat of chocolate-colored velvet，with diamond buttons，and with two huge pockets which were always filled with bones，dropped there at dinner by his loving mistress．Breeches of crimson velvet，silk stockings，and low，silver-buckled slippers completed his costume．His tail was encased in a blue silk covering，which was to protect it from the rain．

“Come，Medoro，” said the Fairy to him．“Get my best coach ready and set out toward the forest．On reaching the oak tree，you will find a poor，half-dead Marionette stretched out on the grass．Lift him up tenderly，place him on the silken cushions of the coach，and bring him here to me．”

The Poodle，to show that he understood，wagged his silk-covered tail two or three times and set off at a quick pace．

In a few minutes，a lovely little coach，made of glass，with lining as soft as whipped cream and chocolate pudding，and stuffed with canary feathers，pulled out of the stable．It was drawn by one hundred pairs of white mice，and the Poodle sat on the coachman's seat and snapped his whip gayly in the air，as if he were a real coachman in a hurry to get to his destination．

In a quarter of an hour the coach was back．The Fairy，who was waiting at the door of the house，lifted the poor little Marionette in her arms，took him to a dainty room with mother-of-pearl walls，put him to bed，and sent immediately for the most famous doctors of the neighborhood to come to her．

One after another the doctors came，a Crow，and Owl，and a Talking Cricket．

“I should like to know，signori，” said the Fairy，turning to the three doctors gathered about Pinocchio's bed，“I should like to know if this poor Marionette is dead or alive．”

At this invitation，the Crow stepped out and felt Pinocchio's pulse，his nose，his little toe．Then he solemnly pronounced the following words：

“To my mind this Marionette is dead and gone；but if，by any evil chance，he were not，then that would be a sure sign that he is still alive！”

“I am sorry，” said the Owl，“to have to contradict the Crow，my famous friend and colleague．To my mind this Marionette is alive；but if，by any evil chance，he were not，then that would be a sure sign that he is wholly dead！”

“And do you hold any opinion？” the Fairy asked the Talking Cricket．

“I say that a wise doctor，when he does not know what he is talking about，should know enough to keep his mouth shut．However，that Marionette is not a stranger to me．I have known him a long time！”

Pinocchio，who until then had been very quiet，shuddered so hard that the bed shook．

“That Marionette，” continued the Talking Cricket，“is a rascal of the worst kind．”

Pinocchio opened his eyes and closed them again．

“He is rude，lazy，a runaway．”

Pinocchio hid his face under the sheets．

“That Marionette is a disobedient son who is breaking his father's heart！”

Long shuddering sobs were heard，cries，and deep sighs．Think how surprised everyone was when，on raising the sheets，they discovered Pinocchio half melted in tears！

“When the dead weep，they are beginning to recover，” said the Crow solemnly．

“I am sorry to contradict my famous friend and colleague，” said the Owl，“but as far as I'm concerned，I think that when the dead weep，it means they do not want to die．”





CHAPTER 17


Pinocchio eats sugar，but refuses to take medicine．When the undertakers come for him，he drinks the medicine and feels better．Afterwards he tells a lie and，in punishment，his nose grows longer and longer．



As soon as the three doctors had left the room，the Fairy went to Pinocchio's bed and，touching him on the forehead，noticed that he was burning with fever．

She took a glass of water，put a white powder into it，and，handing it to the Marionette，said lovingly to him：

“Drink this，and in a few days you'll be up and well．”

Pinocchio looked at the glass，made a wry face，and asked in a whining voice：“Is it sweet or bitter？”

“It is bitter，but it is good for you．”

“If it is bitter，I don't want it．”

“Drink it！”

“I don't like anything bitter．”

“Drink it and I'll give you a lump of sugar to take the bitter taste from your mouth．”

“Where's the sugar？”

“Here it is，” said the Fairy，taking a lump from a golden sugar bowl．

“I want the sugar first，then I'll drink the bitter water．”

“Do you promise？”

“Yes．”

The Fairy gave him the sugar and Pinocchio，after chewing and swallowing it in a twinkling，said，smacking his lips：

“If only sugar were medicine！I should take it every day．”

“Now keep your promise and drink these few drops of water．They'll be good for you．”

Pinocchio took the glass in both hands and stuck his nose into it．He lifted it to his mouth and once more stuck his nose into it．

“It is too bitter，much too bitter！I can't drink it．”

“How do you know，when you haven't even tasted it？”

“I can imagine it．I smell it．I want another lump of sugar，then I'll drink it．”

The Fairy，with all the patience of a good mother，gave him more sugar and again handed him the glass．

“I can't drink it like that，” the Marionette said，making more wry faces．

“Why？”

“Because that feather pillow on my feet bothers me．”

The Fairy took away the pillow．

“It's no use．I can't drink it even now．”

“What's the matter now？”

“I don't like the way that door looks．It's half open．”

The Fairy closed the door．

“I won't drink it，” cried Pinocchio，bursting out crying．“I won't drink this awful water．I won't．I won't！No，no，no，no！”

“My boy，you'll be sorry．”

“I don't care．”

“You are very sick．”

“I don't care．”

“In a few hours the fever will take you far away to another world．”

“I don't care．”

“Aren't you afraid of death？”

“Not a bit．I'd rather die than drink that awful medicine．”

At that moment，the door of the room flew open and in came four Rabbits as black as ink，carrying a small black coffin on their shoulders．

“What do you want from me？” asked Pinocchio．

“We have come for you，” said the largest Rabbit．

“For me？But I'm not dead yet！”

“No，not dead yet；but you will be in a few moments since you have refused to take the medicine which would have made you well．”

“Oh，Fairy，my Fairy，” the Marionette cried out，“give me that glass！Quick，please！I don't want to die！No，no，not yet—not yet！”

And holding the glass with his two hands，he swallowed the medicine at one gulp．

“Well，” said the four Rabbits，“this time we have made the trip for nothing．”

And turning on their heels，they marched solemnly out of the room，carrying their little black coffin and muttering and grumbling between their teeth．

In a twinkling，Pinocchio felt fine．With one leap he was out of bed and into his clothes．

The Fairy，seeing him run and jump around the room gay as a bird on wing，said to him：

“My medicine was good for you，after all，wasn't it？”

“Good indeed！It has given me new life．”

“Why，then，did I have to beg you so hard to make you drink it？”

“I'm a boy，you see，and all boys hate medicine more than they do sickness．”

“What a shame！Boys ought to know，after all，that medicine，taken in time，can save them from much pain and even from death．”

“Next time I won't have to be begged so hard．I'll remember those black Rabbits with the black coffin on their shoulders and I'll take the glass and pouf！—down it will go！”

“Come here now and tell me how it came about that you found yourself in the hands of the Assassins．”

“It happened that Fire Eater gave me five gold pieces to give to my Father，but on the way，I met a Fox and a Cat，who asked me，‘Do you want the five pieces to become two thousand？’ And I said，‘Yes．’ And they said，‘Come with us to the Field of Wonders．’ And I said，‘Let's go．’ Then they said，‘Let us stop at the Inn of the Red Lobster for dinner and after midnight we'll set out again．’ We ate and went to sleep．When I awoke they were gone and I started out in the darkness all alone．On the road I met two Assassins dressed in black coal sacks，who said to me，‘Your money or your life！’ and I said，‘I haven't any money；’ for，you see，I had put the money under my tongue．One of them tried to put his hand in my mouth and I bit it off and spat it out；but it wasn't a hand，it was a cat's paw．And they ran after me and I ran and ran，till at last they caught me and tied my neck with a rope and hanged me to a tree，saying，‘Tomorrow we'll come back for you and you'll be dead and your mouth will be open，and then we'll take the gold pieces that you have hidden under your tongue．’”

“Where are the gold pieces now？” the Fairy asked．

“I lost them，” answered Pinocchio，but he told a lie，for he had them in his pocket．

As he spoke，his nose，long though it was，became at least two inches longer．

“And where did you lose them？”

“In the wood near by．”

At this second lie，his nose grew a few more inches．

“If you lost them in the near-by wood，” said the Fairy，“we'll look for them and find them，for everything that is lost there is always found．”

“Ah，now I remember，” replied the Marionette，becoming more and more confused．“I did not lose the gold pieces，but I swallowed them when I drank the medicine．”

At this third lie，his nose became longer than ever，so long that he could not even turn around．If he turned to the right，he knocked it against the bed or into the windowpanes；if he turned to the left，he struck the walls or the door；if he raised it a bit，he almost put the Fairy's eyes out．

The Fairy sat looking at him and laughing．

“Why do you laugh？” the Marionette asked her，worried now at the sight of his growing nose．

“I am laughing at your lies．”

“How do you know I am lying？”

“Lies，my boy，are known in a moment．There are two kinds of lies，lies with short legs and lies with long noses．Yours，just now，happen to have long noses．”

Pinocchio，not knowing where to hide his shame，tried to escape from the room，but his nose had become so long that he could not get it out of the door．





CHAPTER 18


Pinocchio finds the Fox and the Cat again，and goes with them to sow the gold pieces in the Field of Wonders．



Crying as if his heart would break，the Marionette mourned for hours over the length of his nose．No matter how he tried，it would not go through the door．The Fairy showed no pity toward him，as she was trying to teach him a good lesson，so that he would stop telling lies，the worst habit any boy may acquire．But when she saw him，pale with fright and with his eyes half out of his head from terror，she began to feel sorry for him and clapped her hands together．

A thousand woodpeckers flew in through the window and settled themselves on Pinocchio's nose．They pecked and pecked so hard at that enormous nose that in a few moments，it was the same size as before．

“How good you are，my Fairy，” said Pinocchio，drying his eyes，“and how much I love you！”

“I love you，too，” answered the Fairy，“and if you wish to stay with me，you may be my little brother and I'll be your good little sister．”

“I should like to stay—but what about my poor father？”

“I have thought of everything．Your father has been sent for and before night he will be here．”

“Really？” cried Pinocchio joyfully．“Then，my good Fairy，if you are willing，I should like to go to meet him．I cannot wait to kiss that dear old man，who has suffered so much for my sake．”

“Surely；go ahead，but be careful not to lose your way．Take the wood path and you'll surely meet him．”

Pinocchio set out，and as soon as he found himself in the wood，he ran like a hare．When he reached the giant oak tree he stopped，for he thought he heard a rustle in the brush．He was right．There stood the Fox and the Cat，the two traveling companions with whom he had eaten at the Inn of the Red Lobster．

“Here comes our dear Pinocchio！” cried the Fox，hugging and kissing him．“How did you happen here？”

“How did you happen here？” repeated the Cat．

“It is a long story，” said the Marionette．“Let me tell it to you．The other night，when you left me alone at the Inn，I met the Assassins on the road—”

“The Assassins？Oh，my poor friend！And what did they want？”

“They wanted my gold pieces．”

“Rascals！” said the Fox．

“The worst sort of rascals！” added the Cat．

“But I began to run，” continued the Marionette，“and they after me，until they overtook me and hanged me to the limb of that oak．”

Pinocchio pointed to the giant oak near by．

“Could anything be worse？” said the Fox．“What an awful world to live in！Where shall we find a safe place for gentlemen like ourselves？”

As the Fox talked thus，Pinocchio noticed that the Cat carried his right paw in a sling．

“What happened to your paw？” he asked．

The Cat tried to answer，but he became so terribly twisted in his speech that the Fox had to help him out．

“My friend is too modest to answer．I'll answer for him．About an hour ago，we met an old wolf on the road．He was half starved and begged for help．Having nothing to give him，what do you think my friend did out of the kindness of his heart？With his teeth，he bit off the paw of his front foot and threw it at that poor beast，so that he might have something to eat．”

As he spoke，the Fox wiped off a tear．

Pinocchio，almost in tears himself，whispered in the Cat's ear：

“If all the cats were like you，how lucky the mice would be！”

“And what are you doing here？” the Fox asked the Marionette．

“I am waiting for my father，who will be here at any moment now．”

“And your gold pieces？”

“I still have them in my pocket，except one which I spent at the Inn of the Red Lobster．”

“To think that those four gold pieces might become two thousand tomorrow．Why don't you listen to me？Why don't you sow them in the Field of Wonders？”

“Today it is impossible．I'll go with you some other time．”

“Another day will be too late，” said the Fox．

“Why？”

“Because that field has been bought by a very rich man，and today is the last day that it will be open to the public．”

“How far is this Field of Wonders？”

“Only two miles away．Will you come with us？We'll be there in half an hour．You can sow the money，and，after a few minutes，you will gather your two thousand coins and return home rich．Are you coming？”

Pinocchio hesitated a moment before answering，for he remembered the good Fairy，old Geppetto，and the advice of the Talking Cricket．Then he ended by doing what all boys do，when they have no heart and little brain．He shrugged his shoulders and said to the Fox and the Cat：

“Let us go！I am with you．”

And they went．

They walked and walked for a half a day at least and at last they came to the town called the City of Simple Simons．As soon as they entered the town，Pinocchio noticed that all the streets were filled with hairless dogs，yawning from hunger；with sheared sheep，trembling with cold；with combless chickens，begging for a grain of wheat；with large butterflies，unable to use their wings because they had sold all their lovely colors；with tailless peacocks，ashamed to show themselves；and with bedraggled pheasants，scuttling away hurriedly，grieving for their bright feathers of gold and silver，lost to them forever．

Through this crowd of paupers and beggars，a beautiful coach passed now and again．Within it sat either a Fox，a Hawk，or a Vulture．

“Where is the Field of Wonders？” asked Pinocchio，growing tired of waiting．

“Be patient．It is only a few more steps away．”

They passed through the city and，just outside the walls，they stepped into a lonely field，which looked more or less like any other field．

“Here we are，” said the Fox to the Marionette．“Dig a hole here and put the gold pieces into it．”

The Marionette obeyed．He dug the hole，put the four gold pieces into it，and covered them up very carefully．

“Now，” said the Fox，“go to that near-by brook，bring back a pail full of water，and sprinkle it over the spot．”

Pinocchio followed the directions closely，but，as he had no pail，he pulled off his shoe，filled it with water，and sprinkled the earth which covered the gold．Then he asked：

“Anything else？”

“Nothing else，” answered the Fox．“Now we can go．Return here within twenty minutes and you will find the vine grown and the branches filled with gold pieces．”

Pinocchio，beside himself with joy，thanked the Fox and the Cat many times and promised them each a beautiful gift．

“We don't want any of your gifts，” answered the two rogues．“It is enough for us that we have helped you to become rich with little or no trouble．For this we are as happy as kings．”

They said good-by to Pinocchio and，wishing him good luck，went on their way．





CHAPTER 19


Pinocchio is robbed of his gold pieces and，in punishment，is sentenced to four months in prison．



If the Marionette had been told to wait a day instead of twenty minutes，the time could not have seemed longer to him．He walked impatiently to and fro and finally turned his nose toward the Field of Wonders．

And as he walked with hurried steps，his heart beat with an excited tic，tac，tic，tac，just as if it were a wall clock，and his busy brain kept thinking：

“What if，instead of a thousand，I should find two thousand？Or if，instead of two thousand，I should find five thousand—or one hundred thousand？I'll build myself a beautiful palace，with a thousand stables filled with a thousand wooden horses to play with，a cellar overflowing with lemonade and ice cream soda，and a library of candies and fruits，cakes and cookies．”

Thus amusing himself with fancies，he came to the field．There he stopped to see if，by any chance，a vine filled with gold coins was in sight．But he saw nothing！He took a few steps forward，and still nothing！He stepped into the field．He went up to the place where he had dug the hole and buried the gold pieces．Again nothing！Pinocchio became very thoughtful and，forgetting his good manners altogether，he pulled a hand out of his pocket and gave his head a thorough scratching．

As he did so，he heard a hearty burst of laughter close to his head．He turned sharply，and there，just above him on the branch of a tree，sat a large Parrot，busily preening his feathers．

“What are you laughing at？” Pinocchio asked peevishly．

“I am laughing because，in preening my feathers，I tickled myself under the wings．”

The Marionette did not answer．He walked to the brook，filled his shoe with water，and once more sprinkled the ground which covered the gold pieces．

Another burst of laughter，even more impertinent than the first，was heard in the quiet field．

“Well，” cried the Marionette，angrily this time，“may I know，Mr．Parrot，what amuses you so？”

“I am laughing at those simpletons who believe everything they hear and who allow themselves to be caught so easily in the traps set for them．”

“Do you，perhaps，mean me？”

“I certainly do mean you，poor Pinocchio—you who are such a little silly as to believe that gold can be sown in a field just like beans or squash．I，too，believed that once and today I am very sorry for it．Today（but too late！）I have reached the conclusion that，in order to come by money honestly，one must work and know how to earn it with hand or brain．”

“I don't know what you are talking about，” said the Marionette，who was beginning to tremble with fear．

“Too bad！I'll explain myself better，” said the Parrot．“While you were away in the city the Fox and the Cat returned here in a great hurry．They took the four gold pieces which you have buried and ran away as fast as the wind．If you can catch them，you're a brave one！”

Pinocchio's mouth opened wide．He would not believe the Parrot's words and began to dig away furiously at the earth．He dug and he dug till the hole was as big as himself，but no money was there．Every penny was gone．

In desperation，he ran to the city and went straight to the courthouse to report the robbery to the magistrate．The Judge was a Monkey，a large Gorilla venerable with age．A flowing white beard covered his chest and he wore gold-rimmed spectacles from which the glasses had dropped out．The reason for wearing these，he said，was that his eyes had been weakened by the work of many years．

Pinocchio，standing before him，told his pitiful tale，word by word．He gave the names and the descriptions of the robbers and begged for justice．

The Judge listened to him with great patience．A kind look shone in his eyes．He became very much interested in the story；he felt moved；he almost wept．When the Marionette had no more to say，the Judge put out his hand and rang a bell．

At the sound，two large Mastiffs appeared，dressed in Carabineers' uniforms．

Then the magistrate，pointing to Pinocchio，said in a very solemn voice：

“This poor simpleton has been robbed of four gold pieces．Take him，therefore，and throw him into prison．” The Marionette，on hearing this sentence passed upon him，was thoroughly stunned．He tried to protest，but the two officers clapped their paws on his mouth and hustled him away to jail．

There he had to remain for four long，weary months．And if it had not been for a very lucky chance，he probably would have had to stay there longer．For，my dear children，you must know that it happened just then that the young emperor who ruled over the City of Simple Simons had gained a great victory over his enemy，and in celebration thereof，he had ordered illuminations，fireworks，shows of all kinds，and，best of all，the opening of all prison doors．

“If the others go，I go，too，” said Pinocchio to the Jailer．

“Not you，” answered the Jailer．“You are one of those—”

“I beg your pardon，” interrupted Pinocchio，“I，too，am a thief．”

“In that case you also are free，” said the Jailer．Taking off his cap，he bowed low and opened the door of the prison，and Pinocchio ran out and away，with never a look backward．





CHAPTER 20


Freed from prison，Pinocchio sets out to return to the Fairy；but on the way he meets a Serpent and later is caught in a trap．



Fancy the happiness of Pinocchio on finding himself free！Without saying yes or no，he fled from the city and set out on the road that was to take him back to the house of the lovely Fairy．

It had rained for many days，and the road was so muddy that，at times，Pinocchio sank down almost to his knees．

But he kept on bravely．

Tormented by the wish to see his father and his fairy sister with azure hair，he raced like a greyhound．As he ran，he was splashed with mud even up to his cap．

“How unhappy I have been，” he said to himself．“And yet I deserve everything，for I am certainly very stubborn and stupid！I will always have my own way．I won't listen to those who love me and who have more brains than I．But from now on，I'll be different and I'll try to become a most obedient boy．I have found out，beyond any doubt whatever，that disobedient boys are certainly far from happy，and that，in the long run，they always lose out．I wonder if Father is waiting for me．Will I find him at the Fairy's house？It is so long，poor man，since I have seen him，and I do so want his love and his kisses．And will the Fairy ever forgive me for all I have done？She who has been so good to me and to whom I owe my life！Can there be a worse or more heartless boy than I am anywhere？”

As he spoke，he stopped suddenly，frozen with terror．

What was the matter？An immense Serpent lay stretched across the road—a Serpent with a bright green skin，fiery eyes which glowed and burned，and a pointed tail that smoked like a chimney．

How frightened was poor Pinocchio！He ran back wildly for half a mile，and at last settled himself atop a heap of stones to wait for the Serpent to go on his way and leave the road clear for him．

He waited an hour；two hours；three hours；but the Serpent was always there，and even from afar one could see the flash of his red eyes and the column of smoke which rose from his long，pointed tail．

Pinocchio，trying to feel very brave，walked straight up to him and said in a sweet，soothing voice：

“I beg your pardon，Mr．Serpent，would you be so kind as to step aside to let me pass？”

He might as well have talked to a wall．The Serpent never moved．

Once more，in the same sweet voice，he spoke：

“You must know，Mr．Serpent，that I am going home where my father is waiting for me．It is so long since I have seen him！Would you mind very much if I passed？”

He waited for some sign of an answer to his questions，but the answer did not come．On the contrary，the green Serpent，who had seemed，until then，wide awake and full of life，became suddenly very quiet and still．His eyes closed and his tail stopped smoking．

“Is he dead，I wonder？” said Pinocchio，rubbing his hands together happily．Without a moment's hesitation，he started to step over him，but he had just raised one leg when the Serpent shot up like a spring and the Marionette fell head over heels backward．He fell so awkwardly that his head stuck in the mud，and there he stood with his legs straight up in the air．

At the sight of the Marionette kicking and squirming like a young whirlwind，the Serpent laughed so heartily and so long that at last he burst an artery and died on the spot．

Pinocchio freed himself from his awkward position and once more began to run in order to reach the Fairy's house before dark．As he went，the pangs of hunger grew so strong that，unable to withstand them，he jumped into a field to pick a few grapes that tempted him．Woe to him！

No sooner had he reached the grapevine than—crack！went his legs．

The poor Marionette was caught in a trap set there by a Farmer for some Weasels which came every night to steal his chickens．





CHAPTER 21


Pinocchio is caught by a Farmer，who uses him as a watchdog for his chicken coop．



Pinocchio，as you may well imagine，began to scream and weep and beg；but all was of no use，for no houses were to be seen and not a soul passed by on the road．

Night came on．

A little because of the sharp pain in his legs，a little because of fright at finding himself alone in the darkness of the field，the Marionette was about to faint，when he saw a tiny Glowworm flickering by．He called to her and said：

“Dear little Glowworm，will you set me free？”

“Poor little fellow！” replied the Glowworm，stopping to look at him with pity．“How came you to be caught in this trap？”

“I stepped into this lonely field to take a few grapes and—”

“Are the grapes yours？”

“No．”

“Who has taught you to take things that do not belong to you？”

“I was hungry．”

“Hunger，my boy，is no reason for taking something which belongs to another．”

“It's true，it's true！” cried Pinocchio in tears．“I won't do it again．”

Just then，the conversation was interrupted by approaching footsteps．It was the owner of the field，who was coming on tiptoes to see if，by chance，he had caught the Weasels which had been eating his chickens．

Great was his surprise when，on holding up his lantern，he saw that，instead of a Weasel，he had caught a boy！

“Ah，you little thief！” said the Farmer in an angry voice．“So you are the one who steals my chickens！”

“Not I！No，no！” cried Pinocchio，sobbing bitterly．“I came here only to take a very few grapes．”

“He who steals grapes may very easily steal chickens also．Take my word for it，I'll give you a lesson that you'll remember for a long while．”

He opened the trap，grabbed the Marionette by the collar，and carried him to the house as if he were a puppy．When he reached the yard in front of the house，he flung him to the ground，put a foot on his neck，and said to him roughly：“It is late now and it's time for bed．Tomorrow we'll settle matters．In the meantime，since my watchdog died today，you may take his place and guard my henhouse．”

No sooner said than done．He slipped a dog collar around Pinocchio's neck and tightened it so that it would not come off．A long iron chain was tied to the collar．The other end of the chain was nailed to the wall．

“If tonight it should happen to rain，” said the Farmer，“you can sleep in that little doghouse near-by，where you will find plenty of straw for a soft bed．It has been Melampo's bed for three years，and it will be good enough for you．And if，by any chance，any thieves should come，be sure to bark！”

After this last warning，the Farmer went into the house and closed the door and barred it．

Poor Pinocchio huddled close to the doghouse more dead than alive from cold，hunger，and fright．Now and again he pulled and tugged at the collar which nearly choked him and cried out in a weak voice：

“I deserve it！Yes，I deserve it！I have been nothing but a truant and a vagabond．I have never obeyed anyone and I have always done as I pleased．If I were only like so many others and had studied and worked and stayed with my poor old father，I should not find myself here now，in this field and in the darkness，taking the place of a farmer's watchdog．Oh，if I could start all over again！But what is done can't be undone，and I must be patient！”

After this little sermon to himself，which came from the very depths of his heart，Pinocchio went into the doghouse and fell asleep．





CHAPTER 22


Pinocchio discovers the thieves and，as a reward for faithfulness，he regains his liberty．



Even though a boy may be very unhappy，he very seldom loses sleep over his worries．The Marionette，being no exception to this rule，slept on peacefully for a few hours till well along toward midnight，when he was awakened by strange whisperings and stealthy sounds coming from the yard．He stuck his nose out of the doghouse and saw four slender，hairy animals．They were Weasels，small animals very fond of both eggs and chickens．One of them left her companions and，going to the door of the doghouse，said in a sweet voice：

“Good evening，Melampo．”

“My name is not Melampo，” answered Pinocchio．

“Who are you，then？”

“I am Pinocchio．”

“What are you doing here？”

“I'm the watchdog．”

“But where is Melampo？Where is the old dog who used to live in this house？”

“He died this morning．”

“Died？Poor beast！He was so good！Still，judging by your face，I think you，too，are a good-natured dog．”

“I beg your pardon，I am not a dog！”

“What are you，then？”

“I am a Marionette．”

“Are you taking the place of the watchdog？”

“I'm sorry to say that I am．I'm being punished．”

“Well，I shall make the same terms with you that we had with the dead Melampo．I am sure you will be glad to hear them．”

“And what are the terms？”

“This is our plan：We'll come once in a while，as in the past，to pay a visit to this henhouse，and we'll take away eight chickens．Of these，seven are for us，and one for you，provided，of course，that you will make believe you are sleeping and will not bark for the Farmer．”

“Did Melampo really do that？” asked Pinocchio．

“Indeed he did，and because of that we were the best of friends．Sleep away peacefully，and remember that before we go we shall leave you a nice fat chicken all ready for your breakfast in the morning．Is that understood？”

“Even too well，” answered Pinocchio．And shaking his head in a threatening manner，he seemed to say，“We'll talk this over in a few minutes，my friends．”

As soon as the four Weasels had talked things over，they went straight to the chicken coop which stood close to the doghouse．Digging busily with teeth and claws，they opened the little door and slipped in．But they were no sooner in than they heard the door close with a sharp bang．

The one who had done the trick was Pinocchio，who，not satisfied with that，dragged a heavy stone in front of it．That done，he started to bark．And he barked as if he were a real watchdog：“Bow，wow，wow！Bow，wow！”

The Farmer heard the loud barks and jumped out of bed．Taking his gun，he leaped to the window and shouted：“What's the matter？”

“The thieves are here，” answered Pinocchio．

“Where are they？”

“In the chicken coop．”

“I'll come down in a second．”

And，in fact，he was down in the yard in a twinkling and running toward the chicken coop．

He opened the door，pulled out the Weasels one by one，and，after tying them in a bag，said to them in a happy voice：“You're in my hands at last！I could punish you now，but I'll wait！In the morning you may come with me to the inn and there you'll make a fine dinner for some hungry mortal．It is really too great an honor for you，one you do not deserve；but，as you see，I am really a very kind and generous man and I am going to do this for you！”

Then he went up to Pinocchio and began to pet and caress him．

“How did you ever find them out so quickly？And to think that Melampo，my faithful Melampo，never saw them in all these years！”

The Marionette could have told，then and there，all he knew about the shameful contract between the dog and the Weasels，but thinking of the dead dog，he said to himself：“Melampo is dead．What is the use of accusing him？The dead are gone and they cannot defend themselves．The best thing to do is to leave them in peace！”

“Were you awake or asleep when they came？” continued the Farmer．

“I was asleep，” answered Pinocchio，“but they awakened me with their whisperings．One of them even came to the door of the doghouse and said to me，‘If you promise not to bark，we will make you a present of one of the chickens for your breakfast．’ Did you hear that？They had the audacity to make such a proposition as that to me！For you must know that，though I am a very wicked Marionette full of faults，still I never have been，nor ever shall be，bribed．”

“Fine boy！” cried the Farmer，slapping him on the shoulder in a friendly way．“You ought to be proud of yourself．And to show you what I think of you，you are free from this instant！”

And he slipped the dog collar from his neck．





CHAPTER 23


Pinocchio weeps upon learning that the Lovely Maiden with Azure Hair is dead．He meets a Pigeon，who carries him to the seashore．He throws himself into the sea to go to the aid of his father．



As soon as Pinocchio no longer felt the shameful weight of the dog collar around his neck，he started to run across the fields and meadows，and never stopped till he came to the main road that was to take him to the Fairy's house．

When he reached it，he looked into the valley far below him and there he saw the wood where unluckily he had met the Fox and the Cat，and the tall oak tree where he had been hanged；but though he searched far and near，he could not see the house where the Fairy with the Azure Hair lived．

He became terribly frightened and，running as fast as he could，he finally came to the spot where it had once stood．The little house was no longer there．In its place lay a small marble slab，which bore this sad inscription：

HERE LIES

THE LOVELY FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR

WHO DIED OF GRIEF

WHEN ABANDONED BY

HER LITTLE BROTHER PINOCCHIO

The poor Marionette was heartbroken at reading these words．He fell to the ground and，covering the cold marble with kisses，burst into bitter tears．He cried all night，and dawn found him still there，though his tears had dried and only hard，dry sobs shook his wooden frame．But these were so loud that they could be heard by the faraway hills．

As he sobbed he said to himself：

“Oh，my Fairy，my dear，dear Fairy，why did you die？Why did I not die，who am so bad，instead of you，who are so good？And my father—where can he be？Please dear Fairy，tell me where he is and I shall never，never leave him again！You are not really dead，are you？If you love me，you will come back，alive as before．Don't you feel sorry for me？I'm so lonely．If the two Assassins come，they'll hang me again from the giant oak tree and I will really die，this time．What shall I do alone in the world？Now that you are dead and my father is lost，where shall I eat？Where shall I sleep？Who will make my new clothes？Oh，I want to die！Yes，I want to die！Oh，oh，oh！”

Poor Pinocchio！He even tried to tear his hair，but as it was only painted on his wooden head，he could not even pull it．

Just then a large Pigeon flew far above him．Seeing the Marionette，he cried to him：

“Tell me，little boy，what are you doing there？”

“Can't you see？I'm crying，” cried Pinocchio，lifting his head toward the voice and rubbing his eyes with his sleeve．

“Tell me，” asked the Pigeon，“do you by chance know of a Marionette，Pinocchio by name？”

“Pinocchio！Did you say Pinocchio？” replied the Marionette，jumping to his feet．“Why，I am Pinocchio！”

At this answer，the Pigeon flew swiftly down to the earth．He was much larger than a turkey．

“Then you know Geppetto also？”

“Do I know him？He's my father，my poor，dear father！Has he，perhaps，spoken to you of me？Will you take me to him？Is he still alive？Answer me，please！Is he still alive？”

“I left him three days ago on the shore of a large sea．”

“What was he doing？”

“He was building a little boat with which to cross the ocean．For the last four months，that poor man has been wandering around Europe，looking for you．Not having found you yet，he has made up his mind to look for you in the New World，far across the ocean．”

“How far is it from here to the shore？” asked Pinocchio anxiously．

“More than fifty miles．”

“Fifty miles？Oh，dear Pigeon，how I wish I had your wings！”

“If you want to come，I'll take you with me．”

“How？”

“Astride my back．Are you very heavy？”

“Heavy？Not at all．I'm only a feather．”

“Very well．”

Saying nothing more，Pinocchio jumped on the Pigeon's back and，as he settled himself，he cried out gayly：

“Gallop on，gallop on，my pretty steed！I'm in a great hurry．”

The Pigeon flew away，and in a few minutes he had reached the clouds．The Marionette looked to see what was below them．His head swam and he was so frightened that he clutched wildly at the Pigeon's neck to keep himself from falling．

They flew all day．Toward evening the Pigeon said：

“I'm very thirsty！”

“And I'm very hungry！” said Pinocchio．

“Let us stop a few minutes at that pigeon coop down there．Then we can go on and be at the seashore in the morning．”

They went into the empty coop and there they found nothing but a bowl of water and a small basket filled with chick-peas．

The Marionette had always hated chick-peas．According to him，they had always made him sick；but that night he ate them with a relish．As he finished them，he turned to the Pigeon and said：

“I never should have thought that chick-peas could be so good！”

“You must remember，my boy，” answered the Pigeon，“that hunger is the best sauce！”

After resting a few minutes longer，they set out again．The next morning they were at the seashore．

Pinocchio jumped off the Pigeon's back，and the Pigeon，not wanting any thanks for a kind deed，flew away swiftly and disappeared．

The shore was full of people，shrieking and tearing their hair as they looked toward the sea．

“What has happened？” asked Pinocchio of a little old woman．

“A poor old father lost his only son some time ago and today he built a tiny boat for himself in order to go in search of him across the ocean．The water is very rough and we're afraid he will be drowned．”

“Where is the little boat？”

“There．Straight down there，” answered the little old woman，pointing to a tiny shadow，no bigger than a nutshell，floating on the sea．

Pinocchio looked closely for a few minutes and then gave a sharp cry：

“It's my father！It's my father！”

Meanwhile，the little boat，tossed about by the angry waters，appeared and disappeared in the waves．And Pinocchio，standing on a high rock，tired out with searching，waved to him with hand and cap and even with his nose．

It looked as if Geppetto，though far away from the shore，recognized his son，for he took off his cap and waved also．He seemed to be trying to make everyone understand that he would come back if he were able，but the sea was so heavy that he could do nothing with his oars．Suddenly a huge wave came and the boat disappeared．

They waited and waited for it，but it was gone．

“Poor man！” said the fisher folk on the shore，whispering a prayer as they turned to go home．

Just then a desperate cry was heard．Turning around，the fisher folk saw Pinocchio dive into the sea and heard him cry out：

“I'll save him！I'll save my father！”

The Marionette，being made of wood，floated easily along and swam like a fish in the rough water．Now and again he disappeared only to reappear once more．In a twinkling，he was far away from land．At last he was completely lost to view．

“Poor boy！” cried the fisher folk on the shore，and again they mumbled a few prayers，as they returned home．





CHAPTER 24


Pinocchio reaches the Island of the Busy Bees and finds the Fairy once more．



Pinocchio，spurred on by the hope of finding his father and of being in time to save him，swam all night long．

And what a horrible night it was！It poured rain，it hailed，it thundered，and the lightning was so bright that it turned the night into day．

At dawn，he saw，not far away from him，a long stretch of sand．It was an island in the middle of the sea．

Pinocchio tried his best to get there，but he couldn't．The waves played with him and tossed him about as if he were a twig or a bit of straw．At last，and luckily for him，a tremendous wave tossed him to the very spot where he wanted to be．The blow from the wave was so strong that，as he fell to the ground，his joints cracked and almost broke．But，nothing daunted，he jumped to his feet and cried：

“Once more I have escaped with my life！”

Little by little the sky cleared．The sun came out in full splendor and the sea became as calm as a lake．

Then the Marionette took off his clothes and laid them on the sand to dry．He looked over the waters to see whether he might catch sight of a boat with a little man in it．He searched and he searched，but he saw nothing except sea and sky and far away a few sails，so small that they might have been birds．

“If only I knew the name of this island！” he said to himself．“If I even knew what kind of people I would find here！But whom shall I ask？There is no one here．”

The idea of finding himself in so lonesome a spot made him so sad that he was about to cry，but just then he saw a big Fish swimming near-by，with his head far out of the water．

Not knowing what to call him，the Marionette said to him：

“Hey there，Mr．Fish，may I have a word with you？”

“Even two，if you want，” answered the fish，who happened to be a very polite Dolphin．

“Will you please tell me if，on this island，there are places where one may eat without necessarily being eaten？”

“Surely，there are，” answered the Dolphin．“In fact you'll find one not far from this spot．”

“And how shall I get there？”

“Take that path on your left and follow your nose．You can't go wrong．”

“Tell me another thing．You who travel day and night through the sea，did you not perhaps meet a little boat with my father in it？”

“And who is you father？”

“He is the best father in the world，even as I am the worst son that can be found．”

“In the storm of last night，” answered the Dolphin，“the little boat must have been swamped．”

“And my father？”

“By this time，he must have been swallowed by the Terrible Shark，which，for the last few days，has been bringing terror to these waters．”

“Is this Shark very big？” asked Pinocchio，who was beginning to tremble with fright．

“Is he big？” replied the Dolphin．“Just to give you an idea of his size，let me tell you that he is larger than a five story building and that he has a mouth so big and so deep，that a whole train and engine could easily get into it．”

“Mother mine！” cried the Marionette，scared to death；and dressing himself as fast as he could，he turned to the Dolphin and said：

“Farewell，Mr．Fish．Pardon the bother，and many thanks for your kindness．”

This said，he took the path at so swift a gait that he seemed to fly，and at every small sound he heard，he turned in fear to see whether the Terrible Shark，five stories high and with a train in his mouth，was following him．

After walking a half hour，he came to a small country called the Land of the Busy Bees．The streets were filled with people running to and fro about their tasks．Everyone worked，everyone had something to do．Even if one were to search with a lantern，not one idle man or one tramp could have been found．

“I understand，” said Pinocchio at once wearily，“this is no place for me！I was not born for work．”

But in the meantime，he began to feel hungry，for it was twenty-four hours since he had eaten．

What was to be done？

There were only two means left to him in order to get a bite to eat．He had either to work or to beg．

He was ashamed to beg，because his father had always preached to him that begging should be done only by the sick or the old．He had said that the real poor in this world，deserving of our pity and help，were only those who，either through age or sickness，had lost the means of earning their bread with their own hands．All others should work，and if they didn't，and went hungry，so much the worse for them．

Just then a man passed by，worn out and wet with perspiration，pulling，with difficulty，two heavy carts filled with coal．

Pinocchio looked at him and，judging him by his looks to be a kind man，said to him with eyes downcast in shame：

“Will you be so good as to give me a penny，for I am faint with hunger？”

“Not only one penny，” answered the Coal Man．“I'll give you four if you will help me pull these two wagons．”

“I am surprised！” answered the Marionette，very much offended．“I wish you to know that I never have been a donkey，nor have I ever pulled a wagon．”

“So much the better for you！” answered the Coal Man．“Then，my boy，if you are really faint with hunger，eat two slices of your pride；and I hope they don't give you indigestion．”

A few minutes after，a Bricklayer passed by，carrying a pail full of plaster on his shoulder．

“Good man，will you be kind enough to give a penny to a poor boy who is yawning from hunger？”

“Gladly，” answered the Bricklayer．“Come with me and carry some plaster，and instead of one penny，I'll give you five．”

“But the plaster is heavy，” answered Pinocchio，“and the work too hard for me．”

“If the work is too hard for you，my boy，enjoy your yawns and may they bring you luck！”

In less than a half hour，at least twenty people passed and Pinocchio begged of each one，but they all answered：

“Aren't you ashamed？Instead of being a beggar in the streets，why don't you look for work and earn your own bread？”

Finally a little woman went by carrying two water jugs．

“Good woman，will you allow me to have a drink from one of your jugs？” asked Pinocchio，who was burning up with thirst．

“With pleasure，my boy！” she answered，setting the two jugs on the ground before him．

When Pinocchio had had his fill，he grumbled，as he wiped his mouth：

“My thirst is gone．If I could only as easily get rid of my hunger！”

On hearing these words，the good little woman immediately said：

“If you help me to carry these jugs home，I'll give you a slice of bread．”

Pinocchio looked at the jug and said neither yes nor no．

“And with the bread，I'll give you a nice dish of cauliflower with white sauce on it．”

Pinocchio gave the jug another look and said neither yes nor no．

“And after the cauliflower，some cake and jam．”

At this last bribery，Pinocchio could no longer resist and said firmly：

“Very well．I'll take the jug home for you．”

The jug was very heavy，and the Marionette，not being strong enough to carry it with his hands，had to put it on his head．

When they arrived home，the little woman made Pinocchio sit down at a small table and placed before him the bread，the cauliflower，and the cake．Pinocchio did not eat；he devoured．His stomach seemed a bottomless pit．

His hunger finally appeased，he raised his head to thank his kind benefactress．But he had not looked at her long when he gave a cry of surprise and sat there with his eyes wide open，his fork in the air，and his mouth filled with bread and cauliflower．

“Why all this surprise？” asked the good woman，laughing．

“Because—” answered Pinocchio，stammering and stuttering，“because—you look like—you remind me of—yes，yes，the same voice，the same eyes，the same hair—yes，yes，yes，you also have the same azure hair she had—Oh，my little Fairy，my little Fairy！Tell me that it is you！Don't make me cry any longer！If you only knew！I have cried so much，I have suffered so！”

And Pinocchio threw himself on the floor and clasped the knees of the mysterious little woman．





CHAPTER 25


Pinocchio promises the Fairy to be good and to study，as he is growing tired of being a Marionette，and wishes to become a real boy．



If Pinocchio cried much longer，the little woman thought he would melt away，so she finally admitted that she was the little Fairy with Azure Hair．

“You rascal of a Marionette！How did you know it was I？” she asked，laughing．

“My love for you told me who you were．”

“Do you remember？You left me when I was a little girl and now you find me a grown woman．I am so old，I could almost be your mother！”

“I am very glad of that，for then I can call you mother instead of sister．For a long time I have wanted a mother，just like other boys．But how did you grow so quickly？”

“That's a secret！”

“Tell it to me．I also want to grow a little．Look at me！I have never grown higher than a penny's worth of cheese．”

“But you can't grow，” answered the Fairy．

“Why not？”

“Because Marionettes never grow．They are born Marionettes，they live Marionettes，and they die Marionettes．”

“Oh，I'm tired of always being a Marionette！” cried Pinocchio disgustedly．“It's about time for me to grow into a man as everyone else does．”

“And you will if you deserve it—”

“Really？What can I do to deserve it？”

“It's a very simple matter．Try to act like a well-behaved child．”

“Don't you think I do？”

“Far from it！Good boys are obedient，and you，on the contrary—”

“And I never obey．”

“Good boys love study and work，but you—”

“And I，on the contrary，am a lazy fellow and a tramp all year round．”

“Good boys always tell the truth．”

“And I always tell lies．”

“Good boys go gladly to school．”

“And I get sick if I go to school．From now on I'll be different．”

“Do you promise？”

“I promise．I want to become a good boy and be a comfort to my father．Where is my poor father now？”

“I do not know．”

“Will I ever be lucky enough to find him and embrace him once more？”

“I think so．Indeed，I am sure of it．”

At this answer，Pinocchio's happiness was very great．He grasped the Fairy's hands and kissed them so hard that it looked as if he had lost his head．Then lifting his face，he looked at her lovingly and asked：“Tell me，little Mother，it isn't true that you are dead，is it？”

“It doesn't seem so，” answered the Fairy，smiling．

“If you only knew how I suffered and how I wept when I read ‘Here lies—’”

“I know it，and for that I have forgiven you．The depth of your sorrow made me see that you have a kind heart．There is always hope for boys with hearts such as yours，though they may often be very mischievous．This is the reason why I have come so far to look for you．From now on，I'll be your own little mother．”

“Oh！How lovely！” cried Pinocchio，jumping with joy．

“You will obey me always and do as I wish？”

“Gladly，very gladly，more than gladly！”

“Beginning tomorrow，” said the Fairy，“you'll go to school every day．”

Pinocchio's face fell a little．

“Then you will choose the trade you like best．”

Pinocchio became more serious．

“What are you mumbling to yourself？” asked the Fairy．

“I was just saying，” whined the Marionette in a whisper，“that it seems too late for me to go to school now．”

“No，indeed．Remember it is never too late to learn．”

“But I don't want either trade or profession．”

“Why？”

“Because work wearies me！”

“My dear boy，” said the Fairy，“people who speak as you do usually end their days either in a prison or in a hospital．A man，remember，whether rich or poor，should do something in this world．No one can find happiness without work．Woe betide the lazy fellow！Laziness is a serious illness and one must cure it immediately；yes，even from early childhood．If not，it will kill you in the end．”

These words touched Pinocchio's heart．He lifted his eyes to his Fairy and said seriously：“I'll work；I'll study；I'll do all you tell me．After all，the life of a Marionette has grown very tiresome to me and I want to become a boy，no matter how hard it is．You promise that，do you not？”

“Yes，I promise，and now it is up to you．”





CHAPTER 26


Pinocchio goes to the seashore with his friends to see the Terrible Shark．



In the morning，bright and early，Pinocchio started for school．

Imagine what the boys said when they saw a Marionette enter the classroom！They laughed until they cried．Everyone played tricks on him．One pulled his hat off，another tugged at his coat，a third tried to paint a mustache under his nose．One even attempted to tie strings to his feet and his hands to make him dance．

For a while Pinocchio was very calm and quiet．Finally，however，he lost all patience and turning to his tormentors，he said to them threateningly：

“Careful，boys，I haven't come here to be made fun of．I'll respect you and I want you to respect me．”

“Hurrah for Dr．Know-all！You have spoken like a printed book！” howled the boys，bursting with laughter．One of them，more impudent than the rest，put out his hand to pull the Marionette's nose．

But he was not quick enough，for Pinocchio stretched his leg under the table and kicked him hard on the shin．

“Oh，what hard feet！” cried the boy，rubbing the spot where the Marionette had kicked him．

“And what elbows！They are even harder than the feet！” shouted another one，who，because of some other trick，had received a blow in the stomach．

With that kick and that blow Pinocchio gained everybody's favor．Everyone admired him，danced attendance upon him，petted and caressed him．

As the days passed into weeks，even the teacher praised him，for he saw him attentive，hard working，and wide awake，always the first to come in the morning，and the last to leave when school was over．

Pinocchio's only fault was that he had too many friends．Among these were many well-known rascals，who cared not a jot for study or for success．

The teacher warned him each day，and even the good Fairy repeated to him many times：

“Take care，Pinocchio！Those bad companions will sooner or later make you lose your love for study．Some day they will lead you astray．”

“There's no such danger，” answered the Marionette，shrugging his shoulders and pointing to his forehead as if to say，“I'm too wise．”

So it happened that one day，as he was walking to school，he met some boys who ran up to him and said：

“Have you heard the news？”

“No！”

“A Shark as big as a mountain has been seen near the shore．”

“Really？I wonder if it could be the same one I heard of when my father was drowned？”

“We are going to see it．Are you coming？”

“No，not I．I must go to school．”

“What do you care about school？You can go there tomorrow．With a lesson more or less，we are always the same donkeys．”

“And what will the teacher say？”

“Let him talk．He is paid to grumble all day long．”

“And my mother？”

“Mothers don't know anything，” answered those scamps．

“Do you know what I'll do？” said Pinocchio．“For certain reasons of mine，I，too，want to see that Shark；but I'll go after school．I can see him then as well as now．”

“Poor simpleton！” cried one of the boys．“Do you think that a fish of that size will stand there waiting for you？He turns and off he goes，and no one will ever be the wiser．”

“How long does it take from here to the shore？” asked the Marionette．“One hour there and back．”

“Very well，then．Let's see who gets there first！” cried Pinocchio．

At the signal，the little troop，with books under their arms，dashed across the fields．Pinocchio led the way，running as if on wings，the others following as fast as they could．

Now and again，he looked back and，seeing his followers hot and tired，and with tongues hanging out，he laughed out heartily．Unhappy boy！If he had only known then the dreadful things that were to happen to him on account of his disobedience！





CHAPTER 27


The great battle between Pinocchio and his playmates．One is wounded．Pinocchio is arrested．



Going like the wind，Pinocchio took but a very short time to reach the shore．He glanced all about him，but there was no sign of a Shark．The sea was as smooth as glass．

“Hey there，boys！Where's that Shark？” he asked，turning to his playmates．

“He may have gone for his breakfast，” said one of them，laughing．

“Or，perhaps，he went to bed for a little nap，” said another，laughing also．

From the answers and the laughter which followed them，Pinocchio understood that the boys had played a trick on him．

“What now？” he said angrily to them．“What's the joke？”

“Oh，the joke's on you！” cried his tormentors，laughing more heartily than ever，and dancing gayly around the Marionette．

“And that is—？”

“That we have made you stay out of school to come with us．Aren't you ashamed of being such a goody-goody，and of studying so hard？You never have a bit of enjoyment．”

“And what is it to you，if I do study？”

“What does the teacher think of us，you mean？”

“Why？”

“Don't you see？If you study and we don't，we pay for it．After all，it's only fair to look out for ourselves．”

“What do you want me to do？”

“Hate school and books and teachers，as we all do．They are your worst enemies，you know，and they like to make you as unhappy as they can．”

“And if I go on studying，what will you do to me？”

“You'll pay for it！”

“Really，you amuse me，” answered the Marionette，nodding his head．

“Hey，Pinocchio，” cried the tallest of them all，“that will do．We are tired of hearing you bragging about yourself，you little turkey cock！You may not be afraid of us，but remember we are not afraid of you，either！You are alone，you know，and we are seven．”

“Like the seven sins，” said Pinocchio，still laughing．

“Did you hear that？He has insulted us all．He has called us sins．”

“Pinocchio，apologize for that，or look out！”

“Cuck—oo！” said the Marionette，mocking them with his thumb to his nose．

“You'll be sorry！”

“Cuck—oo！”

“We'll whip you soundly！”

“Cuck—oo！”

“You'll go home with a broken nose！”

“Cuck—oo！”

“Very well，then！Take that，and keep it for your supper，” called out the boldest of his tormentors．

And with the words，he gave Pinocchio a terrible blow on the head．

Pinocchio answered with another blow，and that was the signal for the beginning of the fray．In a few moments，the fight raged hot and heavy on both sides．

Pinocchio，although alone，defended himself bravely．With those two wooden feet of his，he worked so fast that his opponents kept at a respectful distance．Wherever they landed，they left their painful mark and the boys could only run away and howl．

Enraged at not being able to fight the Marionette at close quarters，they started to throw all kinds of books at him．Readers，geographies，histories，grammars flew in all directions．But Pinocchio was keen of eye and swift of movement，and the books only passed over his head，landed in the sea，and disappeared．

The fish，thinking they might be good to eat，came to the top of the water in great numbers．Some took a nibble，some took a bite，but no sooner had they tasted a page or two，than they spat them out with a wry face，as if to say：

“What a horrid taste！Our own food is so much better！”

Meanwhile，the battle waxed more and more furious．At the noise，a large Crab crawled slowly out of the water and，with a voice that sounded like a trombone suffering from a cold，he cried out：

“Stop fighting，you rascals！These battles between boys rarely end well．Trouble is sure to come to you！”

Poor Crab！He might as well have spoken to the wind．Instead of listening to his good advice，Pinocchio turned to him and said as roughly as he knew how：

“Keep quiet，ugly Gab！It would be better for you to chew a few cough drops to get rid of that cold you have．Go to bed and sleep！You will feel better in the morning．”

In the meantime，the boys，having used all their books，looked around for new ammunition．Seeing Pinocchio's bundle lying idle near-by，they somehow managed to get hold of it．

One of the books was a very large volume，an arithmetic text，heavily bound in leather．It was Pinocchio's pride．Among all his books，he liked that one the best．

Thinking it would make a fine missile，one of the boys took hold of it and threw it with all his strength at Pinocchio's head．But instead of hitting the Marionette，the book struck one of the other boys，who，as pale as a ghost，cried out faintly：“Oh，Mother，help！I'm dying！” and fell senseless to the ground．

At the sight of that pale little corpse，the boys were so frightened that they turned tail and ran．In a few moments，all had disappeared．

All except Pinocchio．Although scared to death by the horror of what had been done，he ran to the sea and soaked his handkerchief in the cool water and with it bathed the head of his poor little schoolmate．Sobbing bitterly，he called to him，saying：

“Eugene！My poor Eugene！Open your eyes and look at me！Why don't you answer？I was not the one who hit you，you know．Believe me，I didn't do it．Open your eyes，Eugene？If you keep them shut，I'll die，too．Oh，dear me，how shall I ever go home now？How shall I ever look at my little mother again？What will happen to me？Where shall I go？Where shall I hide？Oh，how much better it would have been，a thousand times better，if only I had gone to school！Why did I listen to those boys？They always were a bad influence！And to think that the teacher had told me—and my mother，too！—“Beware of bad company！’ That's what she said．But I'm stubborn and proud．I listen，but always I do as I wish．And then I pay．I've never had a moment's peace since I've been born！Oh，dear！What will become of me？What will become of me？”

Pinocchio went on crying and moaning and beating his head．Again and again he called to his little friend，when suddenly he heard heavy steps approaching．

He looked up and saw two tall Carabineers near him．

“What are you doing stretched out on the ground？” they asked Pinocchio．

“I'm helping this schoolfellow of mine．”

“Has he fainted？”

“I should say so，” said one of the Carabineers，bending to look at Eugene．“This boy has been wounded on the temple．Who has hurt him？”

“Not I，” stammered the Marionette，who had hardly a breath left in his whole body．

“If it wasn't you，who was it，then？”

“Not I，” repeated Pinocchio．

“And with what was he wounded？”

“With this book，” and the Marionette picked up the arithmetic text to show it to the officer．

“And whose book is this？”

“Mine．”

“Enough．”

“Not another word！Get up as quickly as you can and come along with us．”

“But I—”

“Come with us！”

“But I am innocent．”

“Come with us！”

Before starting out，the officers called out to several fishermen passing by in a boat and said to them：

“Take care of this little fellow who has been hurt．Take him home and bind his wounds．Tomorrow we'll come after him．”

They then took hold of Pinocchio and，putting him between them，said to him in a rough voice：“March！And go quickly，or it will be the worse for you！”

They did not have to repeat their words．The Marionette walked swiftly along the road to the village．But the poor fellow hardly knew what he was about．He thought he had a nightmare．He felt ill．His eyes saw everything double，his legs trembled，his tongue was dry，and，try as he might，he could not utter a single word．Yet，in spite of this numbness of feeling，he suffered keenly at the thought of passing under the windows of his good little Fairy's house．What would she say on seeing him between two Carabineers？

They had just reached the village，when a sudden gust of wind blew off Pinocchio's cap and made it go sailing far down the street．

“Would you allow me，” the Marionette asked the Carabineers，“to run after my cap？”

“Very well，go；but hurry．”

The Marionette went，picked up his cap—but instead of putting it on his head，he stuck it between his teeth and then raced toward the sea．

He went like a bullet out of a gun．

The Carabineers，judging that it would be very difficult to catch him，sent a large Mastiff after him，one that had won first prize in all the dog races．Pinocchio ran fast and the Dog ran faster．At so much noise，the people hung out of the windows or gathered in the street，anxious to see the end of the contest．But they were disappointed，for the Dog and Pinocchio raised so much dust on the road that，after a few moments，it was impossible to see them．





CHAPTER 28


Pinocchio runs the danger of being fried in a pan like a fish．



During that wild chase，Pinocchio lived through a terrible moment when he almost gave himself up as lost．This was when Alidoro（that was the Mastiff's name），in a frenzy of running，came so near that he was on the very point of reaching him．

The Marionette heard，close behind him，the labored breathing of the beast who was fast on his trail，and now and again even felt his hot breath blow over him．

Luckily，by this time，he was very near the shore，and the sea was in sight；in fact，only a few short steps away．

As soon as he set foot on the beach，Pinocchio gave a leap and fell into the water．Alidoro tried to stop，but as he was running very fast，he couldn't，and he，too，landed far out in the sea．Strange though it may seem，the Dog could not swim．He beat the water with his paws to hold himself up，but the harder he tried，the deeper he sank．As he stuck his head out once more，the poor fellow's eyes were bulging and he barked out wildly，“I drown！I drown！”

“Drown！” answered Pinocchio from afar，happy at his escape．

“Help，Pinocchio，dear little Pinocchio！Save me from death！”

At those cries of suffering，the Marionette，who after all had a very kind heart，was moved to compassion．He turned toward the poor animal and said to him：

“But if I help you，will you promise not to bother me again by running after me？”

“I promise！I promise！Only hurry，for if you wait another second，I'll be dead and gone！”

Pinocchio hesitated still another minute．Then，remembering how his father had often told him that a kind deed is never lost，he swam to Alidoro and，catching hold of his tail，dragged him to the shore．

The poor Dog was so weak he could not stand．He had swallowed so much salt water that he was swollen like a balloon．However，Pinocchio，not wishing to trust him too much，threw himself once again into the sea．As he swam away，he called out：

“Good-by，Alidoro，good luck and remember me to the family！”

“Good-by，little Pinocchio，” answered the Dog．“A thousand thanks for having saved me from death．You did me a good turn，and，in this world，what is given is always returned．If the chance comes，I shall be there．”

Pinocchio went on swimming close to shore．At last he thought he had reached a safe place．Glancing up and down the beach，he saw the opening of a cave out of which rose a spiral of smoke．

“In that cave，” he said to himself，“there must be a fire．So much the better．I'll dry my clothes and warm myself，and then—well—”

His mind made up，Pinocchio swam to the rocks，but as he started to climb，he felt something under him lifting him up higher and higher．He tried to escape，but he was too late．To his great surprise，he found himself in a huge net，amid a crowd of fish of all kinds and sizes，who were fighting and struggling desperately to free themselves．

At the same time，he saw a Fisherman come out of the cave，a Fisherman so ugly that Pinocchio thought he was a sea monster．In place of hair，his head was covered by a thick bush of green grass．Green was the skin of his body，green were his eyes，green was the long，long beard that reached down to his feet．He looked like a giant lizard with legs and arms．

When the Fisherman pulled the net out of the sea，he cried out joyfully：

“Blessed Providence！Once more I'll have a fine meal of fish！”

“Thank Heaven，I'm not a fish！” said Pinocchio to himself，trying with these words to find a little courage．

The Fisherman took the net and the fish to the cave，a dark，gloomy，smoky place．In the middle of it，a pan full of oil sizzled over a smoky fire，sending out a repelling odor of tallow that took away one's breath．

“Now，let's see what kind of fish we have caught today，” said the Green Fisherman．He put a hand as big as a spade into the net and pulled out a handful of mullets．

“Fine mullets，these！” he said，after looking at them and smelling them with pleasure．After that，he threw them into a large，empty tub．

Many times he repeated this performance．As he pulled each fish out of the net，his mouth watered with the thought of the good dinner coming，and he said：

“Fine fish，these bass！”

“Very tasty，these whitefish！”

“Delicious flounders，these！”

“What splendid crabs！”

“And these dear little anchovies，with their heads still on！”

As you can well imagine，the bass，the flounders，the whitefish，and even the little anchovies all went together into the tub to keep the mullets company．The last to come out of the net was Pinocchio．

As soon as the Fisherman pulled him out，his green eyes opened wide with surprise，and he cried out in fear：

“What kind of fish is this？I don't remember ever eating anything like it．”

He looked at him closely and after turning him over and over，he said at last：

“I understand．He must be a crab！”

Pinocchio，mortified at being taken for a crab，said resentfully：

“What nonsense！A crab indeed！I am no such thing．Beware how you deal with me！I am a Marionette，I want you to know．”

“A Marionette？” asked the Fisherman．“I must admit that a Marionette fish is，for me，an entirely new kind of fish．So much the better．I'll eat you with greater relish．”

“Eat me？But can't you understand that I'm not a fish？Can't you hear that I speak and think as you do？”

“It's true，” answered the Fisherman；“but since I see that you are a fish，well able to talk and think as I do，I'll treat you with all due respect．”

“And that is—”

“That，as a sign of my particular esteem，I'll leave to you the choice of the manner in which you are to be cooked．Do you wish to be fried in a pan，or do you prefer to be cooked with tomato sauce？”

“To tell you the truth，” answered Pinocchio，“if I must choose，I should much rather go free so I may return home！”

“Are you fooling？Do you think that I want to lose the opportunity to taste such a rare fish？A Marionette fish does not come very often to these seas．Leave it to me．I'll fry you in the pan with the others．I know you'll like it．It's always a comfort to find oneself in good company．”

The unlucky Marionette，hearing this，began to cry and wail and beg．With tears streaming down his cheeks，he said：

“How much better it would have been for me to go to school！I did listen to my playmates and now I am paying for it！Oh！Oh！Oh！”

And as he struggled and squirmed like an eel to escape from him，the Green Fisherman took a stout cord and tied him hand and foot，and threw him into the bottom of the tub with the others．

Then he pulled a wooden bowl full of flour out of a cupboard and started to roll the fish into it，one by one．When they were white with it，he threw them into the pan．The first to dance in the hot oil were the mullets，the bass followed，then the whitefish，the flounders，and the anchovies．Pinocchio's turn came last．Seeing himself so near to death（and such a horrible death！）he began to tremble so with fright that he had no voice left with which to beg for his life．

The poor boy beseeched only with his eyes．But the Green Fisherman，not even noticing that it was he，turned him over and over in the flour until he looked like a Marionette made of chalk．

Then he took him by the head and…





CHAPTER 29


Pinocchio returns to the Fairy's house and she promises him that，on the morrow，he will cease to be a Marionette and become a boy．A wonderful party of coffee-and-milk to celebrate the great event．



Mindful of what the Fisherman had said，Pinocchio knew that all hope of being saved had gone．He closed his eyes and waited for the final moment．

Suddenly，a large Dog，attracted by the odor of the boiling oil，came running into the cave．

“Get out！” cried the Fisherman threateningly and still holding onto the Marionette，who was all covered with flour．

But the poor Dog was very hungry，and whining and wagging his tail，he tried to say：

“Give me a bite of the fish and I'll go in peace．”

“Get out，I say！” repeated the Fisherman．

And he drew back his foot to give the Dog a kick．

Then the Dog，who，being really hungry，would take no refusal，turned in a rage toward the Fisherman and bared his terrible fangs．And at that moment，a pitiful little voice was heard saying：“Save me，Alidoro；if you don't，I fry！”

The Dog immediately recognized Pinocchio's voice．Great was his surprise to find that the voice came from the little flour-covered bundle that the Fisherman held in his hand．

Then what did he do？With one great leap，he grasped that bundle in his mouth and，holding it lightly between his teeth，ran through the door and disappeared like a flash！

The Fisherman，angry at seeing his meal snatched from under his nose，ran after the Dog，but a bad fit of coughing made him stop and turn back．

Meanwhile，Alidoro，as soon as he had found the road which led to the village，stopped and dropped Pinocchio softly to the ground．

“How much I do thank you！” said the Marionette．

“It is not necessary，” answered the Dog．“You saved me once，and what is given is always returned．We are in this world to help one another．”

“But how did you get in that cave？”

“I was lying here on the sand more dead than alive，when an appetizing odor of fried fish came to me．That odor tickled my hunger and I followed it．Oh，if I had come a moment later！”

“Don't speak about it，” wailed Pinocchio，still trembling with fright．“Don't say a word．If you had come a moment later，I would be fried，eaten，and digested by this time．Brrrrrr！I shiver at the mere thought of it．”

Alidoro laughingly held out his paw to the Marionette，who shook it heartily，feeling that now he and the Dog were good friends．Then they bid each other good-by and the Dog went home．

Pinocchio，left alone，walked toward a little hut near by，where an old man sat at the door sunning himself，and asked：

“Tell me，good man，have you heard anything of a poor boy with a wounded head，whose name was Eugene？”

“The boy was brought to this hut and now—”

“Now he is dead？” Pinocchio interrupted sorrowfully．

“No，he is now alive and he has already returned home．”

“Really？Really？” cried the Marionette，jumping around with joy．“Then the wound was not serious？”

“But it might have been—and even mortal，” answered the old man，“for a heavy book was thrown at his head．”

“And who threw it？”

“A schoolmate of his，a certain Pinocchio．”

“And who is this Pinocchio？” asked the Marionette，feigning ignorance．

“They say he is a mischief-maker，a tramp，a street urchin—”

“Calumnies！All calumnies！”

“Do you know this Pinocchio？”

“By sight！” answered the Marionette．

“And what do you think of him？” asked the old man．

“I think he's a very good boy，fond of study，obedient，kind to his Father，and to his whole family—”

As he was telling all these enormous lies about himself，Pinocchio touched his nose and found it twice as long as it should be．Scared out of his wits，he cried out：

“Don't listen to me，good man！All the wonderful things I have said are not true at all．I know Pinocchio well and he is indeed a very wicked fellow，lazy and disobedient，who instead of going to school，runs away with his playmates to have a good time．”

At this speech，his nose returned to its natural size．

“Why are you so pale？” the old man asked suddenly．

“Let me tell you．Without knowing it，I rubbed myself against a newly painted wall，” he lied，ashamed to say that he had been made ready for the frying pan．

“What have you done with your coat and your hat and your breeches？”

“I met thieves and they robbed me．Tell me，my good man，have you not，perhaps，a little suit to give me，so that I may go home？”

“My boy，as for clothes，I have only a bag in which I keep hops．If you want it，take it．There it is．”

Pinocchio did not wait for him to repeat his words．He took the bag，which happened to be empty，and after cutting a big hole at the top and two at the sides，he slipped into it as if it were a shirt．Lightly clad as he was，he started out toward the village．

Along the way he felt very uneasy．In fact he was so unhappy that he went along taking two steps forward and one back，and as he went he said to himself：

“How shall I ever face my good little Fairy？What will she say when she sees me？Will she forgive this last trick of mine？I am sure she won't．Oh，no，she won't．And I deserve it，as usual！For I am a rascal，fine on promises which I never keep！”

He came to the village late at night．It was so dark he could see nothing and it was raining pitchforks．

Pinocchio went straight to the Fairy's house，firmly resolved to knock at the door．

When he found himself there，he lost courage and ran back a few steps．A second time he came to the door and again he ran back．A third time he repeated his performance．The fourth time，before he had time to lose his courage，he grasped the knocker and made a faint sound with it．

He waited and waited and waited．Finally，after a full half hour，a top-floor window（the house had four stories）opened and Pinocchio saw a large Snail look out．A tiny light glowed on top of her head．“Who knocks at this late hour？” she called．

“Is the Fairy home？” asked the Marionette．

“The Fairy is asleep and does not wish to be disturbed．Who are you？”

“It is I．”

“Who's I？”

“Pinocchio．”

“Who is Pinocchio？”

“The Marionette；the one who lives in the Fairy's house．”

“Oh，I understand，” said the Snail．“Wait for me there．I'll come down to open the door for you．”

“Hurry，I beg of you，for I am dying of cold．”

“My boy，I am a snail and snails are never in a hurry．”

An hour passed，two hours；and the door was still closed．Pinocchio，who was trembling with fear and shivering from the cold rain on his back，knocked a second time，this time louder than before．

At that second knock，a window on the third floor opened and the same Snail looked out．

“Dear little Snail，” cried Pinocchio from the street．“I have been waiting two hours for you！And two hours on a dreadful night like this are as long as two years．Hurry，please！”

“My boy，” answered the Snail in a calm，peaceful voice，“my dear boy，I am a snail and snails are never in a hurry．” And the window closed．

A few minutes later midnight struck；then one o'clock—two o'clock．And the door still remained closed！

Then Pinocchio，losing all patience，grabbed the knocker with both hands，fully determined to awaken the whole house and street with it．As soon as he touched the knocker，however，it became an eel and wiggled away into the darkness．

“Really？” cried Pinocchio，blind with rage．“If the knocker is gone，I can still use my feet．”

He stepped back and gave the door a most solemn kick．He kicked so hard that his foot went straight through the door and his leg followed almost to the knee．No matter how he pulled and tugged，he could not pull it out．There he stayed as if nailed to the door．

Poor Pinocchio！The rest of the night he had to spend with one foot through the door and the other one in the air．

As dawn was breaking，the door finally opened．That brave little animal，the Snail，had taken exactly nine hours to go from the fourth floor to the street．How she must have raced！

“What are you doing with your foot through the door？” she asked the Marionette，laughing．

“It was a misfortune．Won't you try，pretty little Snail，to free me from this terrible torture？”

“My boy，we need a carpenter here and I have never been one．”

“Ask the Fairy to help me！”

“The Fairy is asleep and does not want to be disturbed．”

“But what do you want me to do，nailed to the door like this？”

“Enjoy yourself counting the ants which are passing by．”

“Bring me something to eat，at least，for I am faint with hunger．”

“Immediately！”

In fact，after three hours and a half，Pinocchio saw her return with a silver tray on her head．On the tray there was bread，roast chicken，fruit．

“Here is the breakfast the Fairy sends to you，” said the Snail．

At the sight of all these good things，the Marionette felt much better．

What was his disgust，however，when on tasting the food，he found the bread to be made of chalk，the chicken of cardboard，and the brilliant fruit of colored alabaster！

He wanted to cry，he wanted to give himself up to despair，he wanted to throw away the tray and all that was on it．Instead，either from pain or weakness，he fell to the floor in a dead faint．

When he regained his senses，he found himself stretched out on a sofa and the Fairy was seated near him．

“This time also I forgive you，” said the Fairy to him．“But be careful not to get into mischief again．”

Pinocchio promised to study and to behave himself．And he kept his word for the remainder of the year．At the end of it，he passed first in all his examinations，and his report was so good that the Fairy said to him happily：

“Tomorrow your wish will come true．”

“And what is it？”

“Tomorrow you will cease to be a Marionette and will become a real boy．”

Pinocchio was beside himself with joy．All his friends and schoolmates must be invited to celebrate the great event！The Fairy promised to prepare two hundred cups of coffee-and-milk and four hundred slices of toast buttered on both sides．

The day promised to be a very gay and happy one，but—

Unluckily，in a Marionette's life there's always a BUT which is apt to spoil everything．





CHAPTER 30


Pinocchio，instead of becoming a boy，runs away to the Land of Toys with his friend，Lamp-Wick．



Coming at last out of the surprise into which the Fairy's words had thrown him，Pinocchio asked for permission to give out the invitations．

“Indeed，you may invite your friends to tomorrow's party．Only remember to return home before dark．Do you understand？”

“I'll be back in one hour without fail，” answered the Marionette．

“Take care，Pinocchio！Boys give promises very easily，but they as easily forget them．”

“But I am not like those others．When I give my word I keep it．”

“We shall see．In case you do disobey，you will be the one to suffer，not anyone else．”

“Why？”

“Because boys who do not listen to their elders always come to grief．”

“I certainly have，” said Pinocchio，“but from now on，I obey．”

“We shall see if you are telling the truth．”

Without adding another word，the Marionette bade the good Fairy good-by，and singing and dancing，he left the house．

In a little more than an hour，all his friends were invited．Some accepted quickly and gladly．Others had to be coaxed，but when they heard that the toast was to be buttered on both sides，they all ended by accepting the invitation with the words，“We'll come to please you．”

Now it must be known that，among all his friends，Pinocchio had one whom he loved most of all．The boy's real name was Romeo，but everyone called him Lamp-Wick，for he was long and thin and had a woebegone look about him．

Lamp-Wick was the laziest boy in the school and the biggest mischief-maker，but Pinocchio loved him dearly．

That day，he went straight to his friend's house to invite him to the party，but Lamp-Wick was not at home．He went a second time，and again a third，but still without success．

Where could he be？Pinocchio searched here and there and everywhere，and finally discovered him hiding near a farmer's wagon．

“What are you doing there？” asked Pinocchio，running up to him．

“I am waiting for midnight to strike to go—”

“Where？”

“Far，far away！”

“And I have gone to your house three times to look for you！”

“What did you want from me？”

“Haven't you heard the news？Don't you know what good luck is mine？”

“What is it？”

“Tomorrow I end my days as a Marionette and become a boy，like you and all my other friends．”

“May it bring you luck！”

“Shall I see you at my party tomorrow？”

“But I'm telling you that I go tonight．”

“At what time？”

“At midnight．”

“And where are you going？”

“To a real country—the best in the world—a wonderful place！”

“What is it called？”

“It is called the Land of Toys．Why don't you come，too？”

“I？Oh，no！”

“You are making a big mistake，Pinocchio．Believe me，if you don't come，you'll be sorry．Where can you find a place that will agree better with you and me？No schools，no teachers，no books！In that blessed place there is no such thing as study．Here，it is only on Saturdays that we have no school．In the Land of Toys，every day，except Sunday，is a Saturday．Vacation begins on the first of January and ends on the last day of December．That is the place for me！All countries should be like it！How happy we should all be！”

“But how does one spend the day in the Land of Toys？”

“Days are spent in play and enjoyment from morn till night．At night one goes to bed，and next morning，the good times begin all over again．What do you think of it？”

“H'm—！” said Pinocchio，nodding his wooden head，as if to say，“It's the kind of life which would agree with me perfectly．”

“Do you want to go with me，then？Yes or no？You must make up your mind．”

“No，no，and again no！I have promised my kind Fairy to become a good boy，and I want to keep my word．Just see：The sun is setting and I must leave you and run．Good-by and good luck to you！”

“Where are you going in such a hurry？”

“Home．My good Fairy wants me to return home before night．”

“Wait two minutes more．”

“It's too late！”

“Only two minutes．”

“And if the Fairy scolds me？”

“Let her scold．After she gets tired，she will stop，” said Lamp-Wick．

“Are you going alone or with others？”

“Alone？There will be more than a hundred of us！”

“Will you walk？”

“At midnight the wagon passes here that is to take us within the boundaries of that marvelous country．”

“How I wish midnight would strike！”

“Why？”

“To see you all set out together．”

“Stay here a while longer and you will see us！”

“No，no．I want to return home．”

“Wait two more minutes．”

“I have waited too long as it is．The Fairy will be worried．”

“Poor Fairy！Is she afraid the bats will eat you up？”

“Listen，Lamp-Wick，” said the Marionette，“are you really sure that there are no schools in the Land of Toys？”

“Not even the shadow of one．”

“Not even one teacher？”

“Not one．”

“And one does not have to study？”

“Never，never，never！”

“What a great land！” said Pinocchio，feeling his mouth water．“What a beautiful land！I have never been there，but I can well imagine it．”

“Why don't you come，too？”

“It is useless for you to tempt me！I told you I promised my good Fairy to behave myself，and I am going to keep my word．”

“Good-by，then，and remember me to the grammar schools，to the high schools，and even to the colleges if you meet them on the way．”

“Good-by，Lamp-Wick．Have a pleasant trip，enjoy yourself，and remember your friends once in a while．”

With these words，the Marionette started on his way home．Turning once more to his friend，he asked him：

“But are you sure that，in that country，each week is composed of six Saturdays and one Sunday？”

“Very sure！”

“And that vacation begins on the first of January and ends on the thirty-first of December？”

“Very，very sure！”

“What a great country！” repeated Pinocchio，puzzled as to what to do．

Then，in sudden determination，he said hurriedly：

“Good-by for the last time，and good luck．”

“Good-by．”

“How soon will you go？”

“Within two hours．”

“What a pity！If it were only one hour，I might wait for you．”

“And the Fairy？”

“By this time I'm late，and one hour more or less makes very little difference．”

“Poor Pinocchio！And if the Fairy scolds you？”

“Oh，I'll let her scold．After she gets tired，she will stop．”

In the meantime，the night became darker and darker．All at once in the distance a small light flickered．A queer sound could be heard，soft as a little bell，and faint and muffled like the buzz of a far-away mosquito．

“There it is！” cried Lamp-Wick，jumping to his feet．

“What？” whispered Pinocchio．

“The wagon which is coming to get me．For the last time，are you coming or not？”

“But is it really true that in that country boys never have to study？”

“Never，never，never！”

“What a wonderful，beautiful，marvelous country！Oh—h—h！！”





CHAPTER 31


After five months of play，Pinocchio wakes up one fine morning and finds a great surprise awaiting him．



Finally the wagon arrived．It made no noise，for its wheels were bound with straw and rags．

It was drawn by twelve pair of donkeys，all of the same size，but all of different color．Some were gray，others white，and still others a mixture of brown and black．Here and there were a few with large yellow and blue stripes．

The strangest thing of all was that those twenty-four donkeys，instead of being iron-shod like any other beast of burden，had on their feet laced shoes made of leather，just like the ones boys wear．

And the driver of the wagon？

Imagine to yourselves a little，fat man，much wider than he was long，round and shiny as a ball of butter，with a face beaming like an apple，a little mouth that always smiled，and a voice small and wheedling like that of a cat begging for food．

No sooner did any boy see him than he fell in love with him，and nothing satisfied him but to be allowed to ride in his wagon to that lovely place called the Land of Toys．

In fact the wagon was so closely packed with boys of all ages that it looked like a box of sardines．They were uncomfortable，they were piled one on top of the other，they could hardly breathe；yet not one word of complaint was heard．The thought that in a few hours they would reach a country where there were no schools，no books，no teachers，made these boys so happy that they felt neither hunger，nor thirst，nor sleep，nor discomfort．

No sooner had the wagon stopped than the little fat man turned to Lamp-Wick．With bows and smiles，he asked in a wheedling tone：

“Tell me，my fine boy，do you also want to come to my wonderful country？”

“Indeed I do．”

“But I warn you，my little dear，there's no more room in the wagon．It is full．”

“Never mind，” answered Lamp-Wick．“If there's no room inside，I can sit on the top of the coach．”

And with one leap，he perched himself there．

“What about you，my love？” asked the Little Man，turning politely to Pinocchio．“What are you going to do？Will you come with us，or do you stay here？”

“I stay here，” answered Pinocchio．“I want to return home，as I prefer to study and to succeed in life．”

“May that bring you luck！”

“Pinocchio！” Lamp-Wick called out．“Listen to me．Come with us and we'll always be happy．”

“No，no，no！”

“Come with us and we'll always be happy，” cried four other voices from the wagon．

“Come with us and we'll always be happy，” shouted the one hundred and more boys in the wagon，all together．

“And if I go with you，what will my good Fairy say？” asked the Marionette，who was beginning to waver and weaken in his good resolutions．

“Don't worry so much．Only think that we are going to a land where we shall be allowed to make all the racket we like from morning till night．”

Pinocchio did not answer，but sighed deeply once—twice—a third time．Finally，he said：

“Make room for me．I want to go，too！”

“The seats are all filled，” answered the Little Man，“but to show you how much I think of you，take my place as coachman．”

“And you？”

“I'll walk．”

“No，indeed．I could not permit such a thing．I much prefer riding one of these donkeys，” cried Pinocchio．

No sooner said than done．He approached the first donkey and tried to mount it．But the little animal turned suddenly and gave him such a terrible kick in the stomach that Pinocchio was thrown to the ground and fell with his legs in the air．

At this unlooked-for entertainment，the whole company of runaways laughed uproariously．

The little fat man did not laugh．He went up to the rebellious animal，and，still smiling，bent over him lovingly and bit off half of his right ear．

In the meantime，Pinocchio lifted himself up from the ground，and with one leap landed on the donkey's back．The leap was so well taken that all the boys shouted，

“Hurrah for Pinocchio！” and clapped their hands in hearty applause．

Suddenly the little donkey gave a kick with his two hind feet and，at this unexpected move，the poor Marionette found himself once again sprawling right in the middle of the road．

Again the boys shouted with laughter．But the Little Man，instead of laughing，became so loving toward the little animal that，with another kiss，he bit off half of his left ear．

“You can mount now，my boy，” he then said to Pinocchio．“Have no fear．That donkey was worried about something，but I have spoken to him and now he seems quiet and reasonable．”

Pinocchio mounted and the wagon started on its way．

While the donkeys galloped along the stony road，the Marionette fancied he heard a very quiet voice whispering to him：

“Poor silly！You have done as you wished．But you are going to be a sorry boy before very long．”

Pinocchio，greatly frightened，looked about him to see whence the words had come，but he saw no one．The donkeys galloped，the wagon rolled on smoothly，the boys slept（Lamp-Wick snored like a dormouse）and the little，fat driver sang sleepily between his teeth．

After a mile or so，Pinocchio again heard the same faint voice whispering：“Remember，little simpleton！Boys who stop studying and turn their backs upon books and schools and teachers in order to give all their time to nonsense and pleasure，sooner or later come to grief．Oh，how well I know this！How well I can prove it to you！A day will come when you will weep bitterly，even as I am weeping now—but it will be too late！”

At these whispered words，the Marionette grew more and more frightened．He jumped to the ground，ran up to the donkey on whose back he had been riding，and taking his nose in his hands，looked at him．Think how great was his surprise when he saw that the donkey was weeping—weeping just like a boy！

“Hey，Mr．Driver！” cried the Marionette．“Do you know what strange thing is happening here！This donkey weeps．”

“Let him weep．When he gets married，he will have time to laugh．”

“Have you perhaps taught him to speak？”

“No，he learned to mumble a few words when he lived for three years with a band of trained dogs．”

“Poor beast！”

“Come，come，” said the Little Man，“do not lose time over a donkey that can weep．Mount quickly and let us go．The night is cool and the road is long．”

Pinocchio obeyed without another word．The wagon started again．Toward dawn the next morning they finally reached that much-longed-for country，the Land of Toys．

This great land was entirely different from any other place in the world．Its population，large though it was，was composed wholly of boys．The oldest were about fourteen years of age，the youngest，eight．In the street，there was such a racket，such shouting，such blowing of trumpets，that it was deafening．Everywhere groups of boys were gathered together．Some played at marbles，at hopscotch，at ball．Others rode on bicycles or on wooden horses．Some played at blindman's buff，others at tag．Here a group played circus，there another sang and recited．A few turned somersaults，others walked on their hands with their feet in the air．Generals in full uniform leading regiments of cardboard soldiers passed by．Laughter，shrieks，howls，catcalls，hand-clapping followed this parade．One boy made a noise like a hen，another like a rooster，and a third imitated a lion in his den．All together they created such a pandemonium that it would have been necessary for you to put cotton in your ears．The squares were filled with small wooden theaters，overflowing with boys from morning till night，and on the walls of the houses，written with charcoal，were words like these：HURRAH FOR THE LAND OF TOYS！DOWN WITH ARITHMETIC！NO MORE SCHOOL！

As soon as they had set foot in that land，Pinocchio，Lamp-Wick，and all the other boys who had traveled with them started out on a tour of investigation．They wandered everywhere，they looked into every nook and corner，house and theater．They became everybody's friend．Who could be happier than they？

What with entertainments and parties，the hours，the days，the weeks passed like lightning．

“Oh，what a beautiful life this is！” said Pinocchio each time that，by chance，he met his friend Lamp-Wick．

“Was I right or wrong？” answered Lamp-Wick．“And to think you did not want to come！To think that even yesterday the idea came into your head to return home to see your Fairy and to start studying again！If today you are free from pencils and books and school，you owe it to me，to my advice，to my care．Do you admit it？Only true friends count，after all．”

“It's true，Lamp-Wick，it's true．If today I am a really happy boy，it is all because of you．And to think that the teacher，when speaking of you，used to say，‘Do not go with that Lamp-Wick！He is a bad companion and some day he will lead you astray．’”

“Poor teacher！” answered the other，nodding his head．“Indeed I know how much he disliked me and how he enjoyed speaking ill of me．But I am of a generous nature，and I gladly forgive him．”

“Great soul！” said Pinocchio，fondly embracing his friend．

Five months passed and the boys continued playing and enjoying themselves from morn till night，without ever seeing a book，or a desk，or a school．But，my children，there came a morning when Pinocchio awoke and found a great surprise awaiting him，a surprise which made him feel very unhappy，as you shall see．





CHAPTER 32


Pinocchio's ears become like those of a Donkey．In a little while he changes into a real Donkey and begins to bray．



Everyone，at one time or another，has found some surprise awaiting him．Of the kind which Pinocchio had on that eventful morning of his life，there are but few．

What was it？I will tell you，my dear little readers．On awakening，Pinocchio put his hand up to his head and there he found—

Guess！

He found that，during the night，his ears had grown at least ten full inches！

You must know that the Marionette，even from his birth，had very small ears，so small indeed that to the naked eye they could hardly be seen．Fancy how he felt when he noticed that overnight those two dainty organs had become as long as shoe brushes！

He went in search of a mirror，but not finding any，he just filled a basin with water and looked at himself．There he saw what he never could have wished to see．His manly figure was adorned and enriched by a beautiful pair of donkey's ears．

I leave you to think of the terrible grief，the shame，the despair of the poor Marionette．

He began to cry，to scream，to knock his head against the wall，but the more he shrieked，the longer and the more hairy grew his ears．

At those piercing shrieks，a Dormouse came into the room，a fat little Dormouse，who lived upstairs．Seeing Pinocchio so grief-stricken，she asked him anxiously：

“What is the matter，dear little neighbor？”

“I am sick，my little Dormouse，very，very sick—and from an illness which frightens me！Do you understand how to feel the pulse？”

“A little．”

“Feel mine then and tell me if I have a fever．”

The Dormouse took Pinocchio's wrist between her paws and，after a few minutes，looked up at him sorrowfully and said：“My friend，I am sorry，but I must give you some very sad news．”

“What is it？”

“You have a very bad fever．”

“But what fever is it？”

“The donkey fever．”

“I don't know anything about that fever，” answered the Marionette，beginning to understand even too well what was happening to him．

“Then I will tell you all about it，” said the Dormouse．“Know then that，within two or three hours，you will no longer be a Marionette，nor a boy．”

“What shall I be？”

“Within two or three hours you will become a real donkey，just like the ones that pull the fruit carts to market．”

“Oh，what have I done？What have I done？” cried Pinocchio，grasping his two long ears in his hands and pulling and tugging at them angrily，just as if they belonged to another．

“My dear boy，” answered the Dormouse to cheer him up a bit，“why worry now？What is done cannot be undone，you know．Fate has decreed that all lazy boys who come to hate books and schools and teachers and spend all their days with toys and games must sooner or later turn into donkeys．”

“But is it really so？” asked the Marionette，sobbing bitterly．

“I am sorry to say it is．And tears now are useless．You should have thought of all this before．”

“But the fault is not mine．Believe me，little Dormouse，the fault is all Lamp-Wick's．”

“And who is this Lamp-Wick？”

“A classmate of mine．I wanted to return home．I wanted to be obedient．I wanted to study and to succeed in school，but Lamp-Wick said to me，‘Why do you want to waste your time studying？Why do you want to go to school？Come with me to the Land of Toys．There we'll never study again．There we can enjoy ourselves and be happy from morn till night．’”

“And why did you follow the advice of that false friend？”

“Why？Because，my dear little Dormouse，I am a heedless Marionette—heedless and heartless．Oh！If I had only had a bit of heart，I should never have abandoned that good Fairy，who loved me so well and who has been so kind to me！And by this time，I should no longer be a Marionette．I should have become a real boy，like all these friends of mine！Oh，if I meet Lamp-Wick I am going to tell him what I think of him—and more，too！”

After this long speech，Pinocchio walked to the door of the room．But when he reached it，remembering his donkey ears，he felt ashamed to show them to the public and turned back．He took a large cotton bag from a shelf，put it on his head，and pulled it far down to his very nose．

Thus adorned，he went out．He looked for Lamp-Wick everywhere，along the streets，in the squares，inside the theatres，everywhere；but he was not to be found．He asked everyone whom he met about him，but no one had seen him．In desperation，he returned home and knocked at the door．

“Who is it？” asked Lamp-Wick from within．

“It is I！” answered the Marionette．

“Wait a minute．”

After a full half hour the door opened．Another surprise awaited Pinocchio！There in the room stood his friend，with a large cotton bag on his head，pulled far down to his very nose．

At the sight of that bag，Pinocchio felt slightly happier and thought to himself：

“My friend must be suffering from the same sickness that I am！I wonder if he，too，has donkey fever？”

But pretending he had seen nothing，he asked with a smile：

“How are you，my dear Lamp-Wick？”

“Very well．Like a mouse in a Parmesan cheese．”

“Is that really true？”

“Why should I lie to you？”

“I beg your pardon，my friend，but why then are you wearing that cotton bag over your ears？”

“The doctor has ordered it because one of my knees hurts．And you，dear Marionette，why are you wearing that cotton bag down to your nose？”

“The doctor has ordered it because I have bruised my foot．”

“Oh，my poor Pinocchio！”

“Oh，my poor Lamp-Wick！”

An embarrassingly long silence followed these words，during which time the two friends looked at each other in a mocking way．

Finally the Marionette，in a voice sweet as honey and soft as a flute，said to his companion：

“Tell me，Lamp-Wick，dear friend，have you ever suffered from an earache？”

“Never！And you？”

“Never！Still，since this morning my ear has been torturing me．”

“So has mine．”

“Yours，too？And which ear is it？”

“Both of them．And yours？”

“Both of them，too．I wonder if it could be the same sickness．”

“I'm afraid it is．”

“Will you do me a favor，Lamp-Wick？”

“Gladly！With my whole heart．”

“Will you let me see your ears？”

“Why not？But before I show you mine，I want to see yours，dear Pinocchio．”

“No．You must show yours first．”

“No，my dear！Yours first，then mine．”

“Well，then，” said the Marionette，“let us make a contract．”

“Let's hear the contract！”

“Let us take off our caps together．All right？”

“All right．”

“Ready then！”

Pinocchio began to count，“One！Two！Three！”

At the word “Three！” the two boys pulled off their caps and threw them high in air．

And then a scene took place which is hard to believe，but it is all too true．The Marionette and his friend，Lamp-Wick，when they saw each other both stricken by the same misfortune，instead of feeling sorrowful and ashamed，began to poke fun at each other，and after much nonsense，they ended by bursting out into hearty laughter．

They laughed and laughed，and laughed again—laughed till they ached—laughed till they cried．

But all of a sudden Lamp-Wick stopped laughing．He tottered and almost fell．Pale as a ghost，he turned to Pinocchio and said：

“Help，help，Pinocchio！”

“What is the matter？”

“Oh，help me！I can no longer stand up．”

“I can't either，” cried Pinocchio；and his laughter turned to tears as he stumbled about helplessly．

They had hardly finished speaking，when both of them fell on all fours and began running and jumping around the room．As they ran，their arms turned into legs，their faces lengthened into snouts and their backs became covered with long gray hairs．

This was humiliation enough，but the most horrible moment was the one in which the two poor creatures felt their tails appear．Overcome with shame and grief，they tried to cry and bemoan their fate．

But what is done can't be undone！Instead of moans and cries，they burst forth into loud donkey brays，which sounded very much like，“Haw！Haw！Haw！”

At that moment，a loud knocking was heard at the door and a voice called to them：

“Open！I am the Little Man，the driver of the wagon which brought you here．Open，I say，or beware！”





CHAPTER 33


Pinocchio，having become a Donkey，is bought by the owner of a Circus，who wants to teach him to do tricks．The Donkey becomes lame and is sold to a man who wants to use his skin for a drumhead．



Very sad and downcast were the two poor little fellows as they stood and looked at each other．

Outside the room，the Little Man grew more and more impatient，and finally gave the door such a violent kick that it flew open．With his usual sweet smile on his lips，he looked at Pinocchio and Lamp-Wick and said to them：

“Fine work，boys！You have brayed well，so well that I recognized your voices immediately，and here I am．”

On hearing this，the two Donkeys bowed their heads in shame，dropped their ears，and put their tails between their legs．

At first，the Little Man petted and caressed them and smoothed down their hairy coats．Then he took out a currycomb and worked over them till they shone like glass．Satisfied with the looks of the two little animals，he bridled them and took them to a market place far away from the Land of Toys，in the hope of selling them at a good price．

In fact，he did not have to wait very long for an offer．Lamp-Wick was bought by a farmer whose donkey had died the day before．Pinocchio went to the owner of a circus，who wanted to teach him to do tricks for his audiences．

And now do you understand what the Little Man's profession was？This horrid little being，whose face shone with kindness，went about the world looking for boys．Lazy boys，boys who hated books，boys who wanted to run away from home，boys who were tired of school—all these were his joy and his fortune．He took them with him to the Land of Toys and let them enjoy themselves to their heart's content．When，after months of all play and no work，they became little donkeys，he sold them on the market place．In a few years，he had become a millionaire．

What happened to Lamp-Wick？My dear children，I do not know．Pinocchio，I can tell you，met with great hardships even from the first day．

After putting him in a stable，his new master filled his manger with straw，but Pinocchio，after tasting a mouthful，spat it out．

Then the man filled the manger with hay．But Pinocchio did not like that any better．

“Ah，you don't like hay either？” he cried angrily．“Wait，my pretty Donkey，I'll teach you not to be so particular．”

Without more ado，he took a whip and gave the Donkey a hearty blow across the legs．

Pinocchio screamed with pain and as he screamed he brayed：

“Haw！Haw！Haw！I can't digest straw！”

“Then eat the hay！” answered his master，who understood the Donkey perfectly．

“Haw！Haw！Haw！Hay gives me a headache！”

“Do you pretend，by any chance，that I should feed you duck or chicken？” asked the man again，and，angrier than ever，he gave poor Pinocchio another lashing．

At that second beating，Pinocchio became very quiet and said no more．

After that，the door of the stable was closed and he was left alone．It was many hours since he had eaten anything and he started to yawn from hunger．As he yawned，he opened a mouth as big as an oven．

Finally，not finding anything else in the manger，he tasted the hay．After tasting it，he chewed it well，closed his eyes，and swallowed it．

“This hay is not bad，” he said to himself．“But how much happier I should be if I had studied！Just now，instead of hay，I should be eating some good bread and butter．Patience！”

Next morning，when he awoke，Pinocchio looked in the manger for more hay，but it was all gone．He had eaten it all during the night．

He tried the straw，but，as he chewed away at it，he noticed to his great disappointment that it tasted neither like rice nor like macaroni．

“Patience！” he repeated as he chewed．“If only my misfortune might serve as a lesson to disobedient boys who refuse to study！Patience！Have patience！”

“Patience indeed！” shouted his master just then，as he came into the stable．“Do you think，perhaps，my little Donkey，that I have brought you here only to give you food and drink？Oh，no！You are to help me earn some fine gold pieces，do you hear？Come along，now．I am going to teach you to jump and bow，to dance a waltz and a polka，and even to stand on your head．”

Poor Pinocchio，whether he liked it or not，had to learn all these wonderful things；but it took him three long months and cost him many，many lashings before he was pronounced perfect．

The day came at last when Pinocchio's master was able to announce an extraordinary performance．The announcements，posted all around the town，and written in large letters，read thus：

GREAT SPECTACLE TONIGHT

LEAPS AND EXERCISES BY THE GREAT ARTISTS

AND THE FAMOUS HORSES

of the

COMPANY

First Public Appearance

of the

FAMOUS DONKEY

called

PINOCCHIO

THE STAR OF THE DANCE

The Theater will be as Light as Day

That night，as you can well imagine，the theater was filled to overflowing one hour before the show was scheduled to start．

Not an orchestra chair could be had，not a balcony seat，nor a gallery seat；not even for their weight in gold．

The place swarmed with boys and girls of all ages and sizes，wriggling and dancing about in a fever of impatience to see the famous Donkey dance．

When the first part of the performance was over，the Owner and Manager of the circus，in a black coat，white knee breeches，and patent leather boots，presented himself to the public and in a loud，pompous voice made the following announcement：

“Most honored friends，Gentlemen and Ladies！

“Your humble servant，the Manager of this theater，presents himself before you tonight in order to introduce to you the greatest，the most famous Donkey in the world，a Donkey that has had the great honor in his short life of performing before the kings and queens and emperors of all the great courts of Europe．

“We thank you for your attention！”

This speech was greeted by much laughter and applause．And the applause grew to a roar when Pinocchio，the famous Donkey，appeared in the circus ring．He was handsomely arrayed．A new bridle of shining leather with buckles of polished brass was on his back；two white camellias were tied to his ears；ribbons and tassels of red silk adorned his mane，which was divided into many curls．A great sash of gold and silver was fastened around his waist and his tail was decorated with ribbons of many brilliant colors．He was a handsome Donkey indeed！

The Manager，when introducing him to the public，added these words：

“Most honored audience！I shall not take your time tonight to tell you of the great difficulties which I have encountered while trying to tame this animal，since I found him in the wilds of Africa．Observe，I beg of you，the savage look of his eye．All the means used by centuries of civilization in subduing wild beasts failed in this case．I had finally to resort to the gentle language of the whip in order to bring him to my will．With all my kindness，however，I never succeeded in gaining my Donkey's love．He is still today as savage as the day I found him．He still fears and hates me．But I have found in him one great redeeming feature．Do you see this little bump on his forehead？It is this bump which gives him his great talent of dancing and using his feet as nimbly as a human being．Admire him，O signori，and enjoy yourselves．I let you，now，be the judges of my success as a teacher of animals．Before I leave you，I wish to state that there will be another performance tomorrow night．If the weather threatens rain，the great spectacle will take place at eleven o'clock in the morning．”

The Manager bowed and then turned to Pinocchio and said：“Ready，Pinocchio！Before starting your performance，salute your audience！”

Pinocchio obediently bent his two knees to the ground and remained kneeling until the Manager，with the crack of the whip，cried sharply：“Walk！”

The Donkey lifted himself on his four feet and walked around the ring．A few minutes passed and again the voice of the Manager called：

“Quickstep！” and Pinocchio obediently changed his step．

“Gallop！” and Pinocchio galloped．

“Full speed！” and Pinocchio ran as fast as he could．As he ran the master raised his arm and a pistol shot rang in the air．

At the shot，the little Donkey fell to the ground as if he were really dead．

A shower of applause greeted the Donkey as he arose to his feet．Cries and shouts and handclappings were heard on all sides．

At all that noise，Pinocchio lifted his head and raised his eyes．There，in front of him，in a box sat a beautiful woman．Around her neck she wore a long gold chain，from which hung a large medallion．On the medallion was painted the picture of a Marionette．

“That picture is of me！That beautiful lady is my Fairy！” said Pinocchio to himself，recognizing her．He felt so happy that he tried his best to cry out：

“Oh，my Fairy！My own Fairy！”

But instead of words，a loud braying was heard in the theater，so loud and so long that all the spectators—men，women，and children，but especially the children—burst out laughing．

Then，in order to teach the Donkey that it was not good manners to bray before the public，the Manager hit him on the nose with the handle of the whip．

The poor little Donkey stuck out a long tongue and licked his nose for a long time in an effort to take away the pain．

And what was his grief when on looking up toward the boxes，he saw that the Fairy had disappeared！

He felt himself fainting，his eyes filled with tears，and he wept bitterly．No one knew it，however，least of all the Manager，who，cracking his whip，cried out：

“Bravo，Pinocchio！Now show us how gracefully you can jump through the rings．”

Pinocchio tried two or three times，but each time he came near the ring，he found it more to his taste to go under it．The fourth time，at a look from his master he leaped through it，but as he did so his hind legs caught in the ring and he fell to the floor in a heap．

When he got up，he was lame and could hardly limp as far as the stable．

“Pinocchio！We want Pinocchio！We want the little Donkey！” cried the boys from the orchestra，saddened by the accident．

No one saw Pinocchio again that evening．

The next morning the veterinary—that is，the animal doctor—declared that he would be lame for the rest of his life．

“What do I want with a lame donkey？” said the Manager to the stableboy．“Take him to the market and sell him．”

When they reached the square，a buyer was soon found．

“How much do you ask for that little lame Donkey？” he asked．

“Four dollars．”

“I'll give you four cents．Don't think I'm buying him for work．I want only his skin．It looks very tough and I can use it to make myself a drumhead．I belong to a musical band in my village and I need a drum．”

I leave it to you，my dear children，to picture to yourself the great pleasure with which Pinocchio heard that he was to become a drumhead！

As soon as the buyer had paid the four cents，the Donkey changed hands．His new owner took him to a high cliff overlooking the sea，put a stone around his neck，tied a rope to one of his hind feet，gave him a push，and threw him into the water．

Pinocchio sank immediately．And his new master sat on the cliff waiting for him to drown，so as to skin him and make himself a drumhead．





CHAPTER 34


Pinocchio is thrown into the sea，eaten by fishes，and becomes a Marionette once more．As he swims to land，he is swallowed by the Terrible Shark．



Down into the sea，deeper and deeper，sank Pinocchio，and finally，after fifty minutes of waiting，the man on the cliff said to himself：

“By this time my poor little lame Donkey must be drowned．Up with him and then I can get to work on my beautiful drum．”

He pulled the rope which he had tied to Pinocchio's leg—pulled and pulled and pulled and，at last，he saw appear on the surface of the water—Can you guess what？Instead of a dead donkey，he saw a very much alive Marionette，wriggling and squirming like an eel．

Seeing that wooden Marionette，the poor man thought he was dreaming and sat there with his mouth wide open and his eyes popping out of his head．

Gathering his wits together，he said：

“And the Donkey I threw into the sea？”

“I am that Donkey，” answered the Marionette laughing．

“You？”

“I．”

“Ah，you little cheat！Are you poking fun at me？”

“Poking fun at you？Not at all，dear Master．I am talking seriously．”

“But，then，how is it that you，who a few minutes ago were a donkey，are now standing before me a wooden Marionette？”

“It may be the effect of salt water．The sea is fond of playing these tricks．”

“Be careful，Marionette，be careful！Don't laugh at me！Woe be to you，if I lose my patience！”

“Well，then，my Master，do you want to know my whole story？Untie my leg and I can tell it to you better．”

The old fellow，curious to know the true story of the Marionette's life，immediately untied the rope which held his foot．Pinocchio，feeling free as a bird of the air，began his tale：

“Know，then，that，once upon a time，I was a wooden Marionette，just as I am today．One day I was about to become a boy，a real boy，but on account of my laziness and my hatred of books，and because I listened to bad companions，I ran away from home．One beautiful morning，I awoke to find myself changed into a donkey—long ears，gray coat，even a tail！What a shameful day for me！I hope you will never experience one like it，dear Master．I was taken to the fair and sold to a Circus Owner，who tried to make me dance and jump through the rings．One night，during a performance，I had a bad fall and became lame．Not knowing what to do with a lame donkey，the Circus Owner sent me to the market place and you bought me．”

“Indeed I did！And I paid four cents for you．Now who will return my money to me？”

“But why did you buy me？You bought me to do me harm—to kill me—to make a drumhead out of me！”

“Indeed I did！And now where shall I find another skin？”

“Never mind，dear Master．There are so many donkeys in this world．”

“Tell me，impudent little rogue，does your story end here？”

“One more word，” answered the Marionette，“and I am through．After buying me，you brought me here to kill me．But feeling sorry for me，you tied a stone to my neck and threw me to the bottom of the sea．That was very good and kind of you to want me to suffer as little as possible and I shall remember you always．And now my Fairy will take care of me，even if you—”

“Your Fairy？Who is she？”

“She is my mother，and，like all other mothers who love their children，she never loses sight of me，even though I do not deserve it．And today this good Fairy of mine，as soon as she saw me in danger of drowning，sent a thousand fishes to the spot where I lay．They thought I was really a dead donkey and began to eat me．What great bites they took！One ate my ears，another my nose，a third my neck and my mane．Some went at my legs and some at my back，and among the others，there was one tiny fish so gentle and polite that he did me the great favor of eating even my tail．”

“From now on，” said the man，horrified，“I swear I shall never again taste fish．How I should enjoy opening a mullet or a whitefish just to find there the tail of a dead donkey！”

“I think as you do，” answered the Marionette，laughing．“Still，you must know that when the fish finished eating my donkey coat，which covered me from head to foot，they naturally came to the bones—or rather，in my case，to the wood，for as you know，I am made of very hard wood．After the first few bites，those greedy fish found out that the wood was not good for their teeth，and，afraid of indigestion，they turned and ran here and there without saying good-by or even as much as thank you to me．Here，dear Master，you have my story．You know now why you found a Marionette and not a dead donkey when you pulled me out of the water．”

“I laugh at your story！” cried the man angrily．“I know that I spent four cents to get you and I want my money back．Do you know what I can do；I am going to take you to the market once more and sell you as dry firewood．”

“Very well，sell me．I am satisfied，” said Pinocchio．But as he spoke，he gave a quick leap and dived into the sea．Swimming away as fast as he could，he cried out，laughing：

“Good-by，Master．If you ever need a skin for your drum，remember me．”

He swam on and on．After a while，he turned around again and called louder than before：

“Good-by，Master．If you ever need a piece of good dry firewood，remember me．”

In a few seconds he had gone so far he could hardly be seen．All that could be seen of him was a very small black dot moving swiftly on the blue surface of the water，a little black dot which now and then lifted a leg or an arm in the air．One would have thought that Pinocchio had turned into a porpoise playing in the sun．

After swimming for a long time，Pinocchio saw a large rock in the middle of the sea，a rock as white as marble．High on the rock stood a little Goat bleating and calling and beckoning to the Marionette to come to her．

There was something very strange about that little Goat．Her coat was not white or black or brown as that of any other goat，but azure，a deep brilliant color that reminded one of the hair of the lovely maiden．

Pinocchio's heart beat fast，and then faster and faster．He redoubled his efforts and swam as hard as he could toward the white rock．He was almost halfway over，when suddenly a horrible sea monster stuck its head out of the water，an enormous head with a huge mouth，wide open，showing three rows of gleaming teeth，the mere sight of which would have filled you with fear．

Do you know what it was？

That sea monster was no other than the enormous Shark，which has often been mentioned in this story and which，on account of its cruelty，had been nicknamed “The Attila of the Sea” by both fish and fishermen．

Poor Pinocchio！The sight of that monster frightened him almost to death！He tried to swim away from him，to change his path，to escape，but that immense mouth kept coming nearer and nearer．

“Hasten，Pinocchio，I beg you！” bleated the little Goat on the high rock．

And Pinocchio swam desperately with his arms，his body，his legs，his feet．

“Quick，Pinocchio，the monster is coming nearer！”

Pinocchio swam faster and faster，and harder and harder．

“Faster，Pinocchio！The monster will get you！There he is！There he is！Quick，quick，or you are lost！”

Pinocchio went through the water like a shot—swifter and swifter．He came close to the rock．The Goat leaned over and gave him one of her hoofs to help him up out of the water．

Alas！It was too late．The monster overtook him and the Marionette found himself in between the rows of gleaming white teeth．Only for a moment，however，for the Shark took a deep breath and，as he breathed，he drank in the Marionette as easily as he would have sucked an egg．Then he swallowed him so fast that Pinocchio，falling down into the body of the fish，lay stunned for a half hour．

When he recovered his senses the Marionette could not remember where he was．Around him all was darkness，a darkness so deep and so black that for a moment he thought he had put his head into an inkwell．He listened for a few moments and heard nothing．Once in a while a cold wind blew on his face．At first he could not understand where that wind was coming from，but after a while he understood that it came from the lungs of the monster．I forgot to tell you that the Shark was suffering from asthma，so that whenever he breathed a storm seemed to blow．

Pinocchio at first tried to be brave，but as soon as he became convinced that he was really and truly in the Shark's stomach，he burst into sobs and tears．“Help！Help！” he cried．“Oh，poor me！Won't someone come to save me？”

“Who is there to help you，unhappy boy？” said a rough voice，like a guitar out of tune．

“Who is talking？” asked Pinocchio，frozen with terror．

“It is I，a poor Tunny swallowed by the Shark at the same time as you．And what kind of a fish are you？”

“I have nothing to do with fishes．I am a Marionette．”

“If you are not a fish，why did you let this monster swallow you？”

“I didn't let him．He chased me and swallowed me without even a ‘by your leave！’ And now what are we to do here in the dark？”

“Wait until the Shark has digested us both，I suppose．”

“But I don't want to be digested，” shouted Pinocchio，starting to sob．

“Neither do I，” said the Tunny，“but I am wise enough to think that if one is born a fish，it is more dignified to die under the water than in the frying pan．”

“What nonsense！” cried Pinocchio．

“Mine is an opinion，” replied the Tunny，“and opinions should be respected．”

“But I want to get out of this place．I want to escape．”

“Go，if you can！”

“Is this Shark that has swallowed us very long？” asked the Marionette．

“His body，not counting the tail，is almost a mile long．”

While talking in the darkness，Pinocchio thought he saw a faint light in the distance．

“What can that be？” he said to the Tunny．

“Some other poor fish，waiting as patiently as we to be digested by the Shark．”

“I want to see him．He may be an old fish and may know some way of escape．”

“I wish you all good luck，dear Marionette．”

“Good-by，Tunny．”

“Good-by，Marionette，and good luck．”

“When shall I see you again？”

“Who knows？It is better not to think about it．”





CHAPTER 35


In the Shark's body Pinocchio finds whom？Read this chapter，my children，and you will know．



Pinocchio，as soon as he had said good-by to his good friend，the Tunny，tottered away in the darkness and began to walk as well as he could toward the faint light which glowed in the distance．

As he walked his feet splashed in a pool of greasy and slippery water，which had such a heavy smell of fish fried in oil that Pinocchio thought it was Lent．

The farther on he went，the brighter and clearer grew the tiny light．On and on he walked till finally he found—I give you a thousand guesses，my dear children！He found a little table set for dinner and lighted by a candle stuck in a glass bottle；and near the table sat a little old man，white as the snow，eating live fish．They wriggled so that，now and again，one of them slipped out of the old man's mouth and escaped into the darkness under the table．

At this sight，the poor Marionette was filled with such great and sudden happiness that he almost dropped in a faint．He wanted to laugh，he wanted to cry，he wanted to say a thousand and one things，but all he could do was to stand still，stuttering and stammering brokenly．At last，with a great effort，he was able to let out a scream of joy and，opening wide his arms he threw them around the old man's neck．

“Oh，Father，dear Father！Have I found you at last？Now I shall never，never leave you again！”

“Are my eyes really telling me the truth？” answered the old man，rubbing his eyes．“Are you really my own dear Pinocchio？”

“Yes，yes，yes！It is I！Look at me！And you have forgiven me，haven't you？Oh，my dear Father，how good you are！And to think that I—Oh，but if you only knew how many misfortunes have fallen on my head and how many troubles I have had！Just think that on the day you sold your old coat to buy me my A-B-C book so that I could go to school，I ran away to the Marionette Theater and the proprietor caught me and wanted to burn me to cook his roast lamb！He was the one who gave me the five gold pieces for you，but I met the Fox and the Cat，who took me to the Inn of the Red Lobster．There they ate like wolves and I left the Inn alone and I met the Assassins in the wood．I ran and they ran after me，always after me，till they hanged me to the branch of a giant oak tree．Then the Fairy of the Azure Hair sent the coach to rescue me and the doctors，after looking at me，said，‘If he is not dead，then he is surely alive，’ and then I told a lie and my nose began to grow．It grew and it grew，till I couldn't get it through the door of the room．And then I went with the Fox and the Cat to the Field of Wonders to bury the gold pieces．The Parrot laughed at me and，instead of two thousand gold pieces，I found none．When the Judge heard I had been robbed，he sent me to jail to make the thieves happy；and when I came away I saw a fine bunch of grapes hanging on a vine．The trap caught me and the Farmer put a collar on me and made me a watchdog．He found out I was innocent when I caught the Weasels and he let me go．The Serpent with the tail that smoked started to laugh and a vein in his chest broke and so I went back to the Fairy's house．She was dead，and the Pigeon，seeing me crying，said to me，‘I have seen your father building a boat to look for you in America，’ and I said to him，‘Oh，if I only had wings！’ and he said to me，‘Do you want to go to your father？’ and I said，‘Perhaps，but how？’ and he said，‘Get on my back．I'll take you there．’ We flew all night long，and next morning the fishermen were looking toward the sea，crying，‘There is a poor little man drowning，’ and I knew it was you，because my heart told me so and I waved to you from the shore—”

“I knew you also，” put in Geppetto，“and I wanted to go to you；but how could I？The sea was rough and the whitecaps overturned the boat．Then a Terrible Shark came up out of the sea and，as soon as he saw me in the water，swam quickly toward me，put out his tongue，and swallowed me as easily as if I had been a chocolate peppermint．”

“And how long have you been shut away in here？”

“From that day to this，two long weary years—two years，my Pinocchio，which have been like two centuries．”

“And how have you lived？Where did you find the candle？And the matches with which to light it—where did you get them？”

“You must know that，in the storm which swamped my boat，a large ship also suffered the same fate．The sailors were all saved，but the ship went right to the bottom of the sea，and the same Terrible Shark that swallowed me，swallowed most of it．”

“What！Swallowed a ship？” asked Pinocchio in astonishment．

“At one gulp．The only thing he spat out was the main-mast，for it stuck in his teeth．To my own good luck，that ship was loaded with meat，preserved foods，crackers，bread，bottles of wine，raisins，cheese，coffee，sugar，wax candles，and boxes of matches．With all these blessings，I have been able to live happily on for two whole years，but now I am at the very last crumbs．Today there is nothing left in the cupboard，and this candle you see here is the last one I have．”

“And then？”

“And then，my dear，we'll find ourselves in darkness．”

“Then，my dear Father，” said Pinocchio，“there is no time to lose．We must try to escape．”

“Escape！How？”

“We can run out of the Shark's mouth and dive into the sea．”

“You speak well，but I cannot swim，my dear Pinocchio．”

“Why should that matter？You can climb on my shoulders and I，who am a fine swimmer，will carry you safely to the shore．”

“Dreams，my boy！” answered Geppetto，shaking his head and smiling sadly．“Do you think it possible for a Marionette，a yard high，to have the strength to carry me on his shoulders and swim？”

“Try it and see！And in any case，if it is written that we must die，we shall at least die together．”

Not adding another word，Pinocchio took the candle in his hand and going ahead to light the way，he said to his father：

“Follow me and have no fear．”

They walked a long distance through the stomach and the whole body of the Shark．When they reached the throat of the monster，they stopped for a while to wait for the right moment in which to make their escape．

I want you to know that the Shark，being very old and suffering from asthma and heart trouble，was obliged to sleep with his mouth open．Because of this，Pinocchio was able to catch a glimpse of the sky filled with stars，as he looked up through the open jaws of his new home．

“The time has come for us to escape，” he whispered，turning to his father．“The Shark is fast asleep．The sea is calm and the night is as bright as day．Follow me closely，dear Father，and we shall soon be saved．”

No sooner said than done．They climbed up the throat of the monster till they came to that immense open mouth．There they had to walk on tiptoes，for if they tickled the Shark's long tongue he might awaken—and where would they be then？The tongue was so wide and so long that it looked like a country road．The two fugitives were just about to dive into the sea when the Shark sneezed very suddenly and，as he sneezed，he gave Pinocchio and Geppetto such a jolt that they found themselves thrown on their backs and dashed once more and very unceremoniously into the stomach of the monster．

To make matters worse，the candle went out and father and son were left in the dark．

“And now？” asked Pinocchio with a serious face．

“Now we are lost．”

“Why lost？Give me your hand，dear Father，and be careful not to slip！”

“Where will you take me？”

“We must try again．Come with me and don't be afraid．”

With these words Pinocchio took his father by the hand and，always walking on tiptoes，they climbed up the monster's throat for a second time．They then crossed the whole tongue and jumped over three rows of teeth．But before they took the last great leap，the Marionette said to his father：

“Climb on my back and hold on tightly to my neck．I'll take care of everything else．”

As soon as Geppetto was comfortably seated on his shoulders，Pinocchio，very sure of what he was doing，dived into the water and started to swim．The sea was like oil，the moon shone in all splendor，and the Shark continued to sleep so soundly that not even a cannon shot would have awakened him．





CHAPTER 36


Pinocchio finally ceases to be a Marionette and becomes a boy．



“My dear Father，we are saved！” cried the Marionette．“All we have to do now is to get to the shore，and that is easy．”

Without another word，he swam swiftly away in an effort to reach land as soon as possible．All at once he noticed that Geppetto was shivering and shaking as if with a high fever．

Was he shivering from fear or from cold？Who knows？Perhaps a little of both．But Pinocchio，thinking his father was frightened，tried to comfort him by saying：

“Courage，Father！In a few moments we shall be safe on land．”

“But where is that blessed shore？” asked the little old man，more and more worried as he tried to pierce the faraway shadows．“Here I am searching on all sides and I see nothing but sea and sky．”

“I see the shore，” said the Marionette．“Remember，Father，that I am like a cat．I see better at night than by day．”

Poor Pinocchio pretended to be peaceful and contented，but he was far from that．He was beginning to feel discouraged，his strength was leaving him，and his breathing was becoming more and more labored．He felt he could not go on much longer，and the shore was still far away．

He swam a few more strokes．Then he turned to Geppetto and cried out weakly：

“Help me，Father！Help，for I am dying！”

Father and son were really about to drown when they heard a voice like a guitar out of tune call from the sea：

“What is the trouble？”

“It is I and my poor father．”

“I know the voice．You are Pinocchio．”

“Exactly．And you？”

“I am the Tunny，your companion in the Shark's stomach．”

“And how did you escape？”

“I imitated your example．You are the one who showed me the way and after you went，I followed．”

“Tunny，you arrived at the right moment！I implore you，for the love you bear your children，the little Tunnies，to help us，or we are lost！”

“With great pleasure indeed．Hang onto my tail，both of you，and let me lead you．In a twinkling you will be safe on land．”

Geppetto and Pinocchio，as you can easily imagine，did not refuse the invitation；indeed，instead of hanging onto the tail，they thought it better to climb on the Tunny's back．

“Are we too heavy？” asked Pinocchio．

“Heavy？Not in the least．You are as light as sea-shells，” answered the Tunny，who was as large as a two-year-old horse．

As soon as they reached the shore，Pinocchio was the first to jump to the ground to help his old father．Then he turned to the fish and said to him：

“Dear friend，you have saved my father，and I have not enough words with which to thank you！Allow me to embrace you as a sign of my eternal gratitude．”

The Tunny stuck his nose out of the water and Pinocchio knelt on the sand and kissed him most affectionately on his cheek．At this warm greeting，the poor Tunny，who was not used to such tenderness，wept like a child．He felt so embarrassed and ashamed that he turned quickly，plunged into the sea，and disappeared．

In the meantime day had dawned．

Pinocchio offered his arm to Geppetto，who was so weak he could hardly stand，and said to him：

“Lean on my arm，dear Father，and let us go．We will walk very，very slowly，and if we feel tired we can rest by the wayside．”

“And where are we going？” asked Geppetto．

“To look for a house or a hut，where they will be kind enough to give us a bite of bread and a bit of straw to sleep on．”

They had not taken a hundred steps when they saw two rough-looking individuals sitting on a stone begging for alms．

It was the Fox and the Cat，but one could hardly recognize them，they looked so miserable．The Cat，after pretending to be blind for so many years had really lost the sight of both eyes．And the Fox，old，thin，and almost hairless，had even lost his tail．That sly thief had fallen into deepest poverty，and one day he had been forced to sell his beautiful tail for a bite to eat．

“Oh，Pinocchio，” he cried in a tearful voice．“Give us some alms，we beg of you！We are old，tired，and sick．”

“Sick！” repeated the Cat．

“Addio，false friends！” answered the Marionette．“You cheated me once，but you will never catch me again．”

“Believe us！Today we are truly poor and starving．”

“Starving！” repeated the Cat．

“If you are poor；you deserve it！Remember the old proverb which says：‘Stolen money never bears fruit．’ Addio，false friends．”

“Have mercy on us！”

“On us．”

“Addio，false friends．Remember the old proverb which says：‘Bad wheat always makes poor bread！’”

“Do not abandon us．”

“Abandon us，” repeated the Cat．

“Addio，false friends．Remember the old proverb：‘Whoever steals his neighbor's shirt，usually dies without his own．’”

Waving good-by to them，Pinocchio and Geppetto calmly went on their way．After a few more steps，they saw，at the end of a long road near a clump of trees，a tiny cottage built of straw．

“Someone must live in that little hut，” said Pinocchio．“Let us see for ourselves．”

They went and knocked at the door．

“Who is it？” said a little voice from within．

“A poor father and a poorer son，without food and with no roof to cover them，” answered the Marionette．

“Turn the key and the door will open，” said the same little voice．

Pinocchio turned the key and the door opened．As soon as they went in，they looked here and there and everywhere but saw no one．

“Oh—ho，where is the owner of the hut？” cried Pinocchio，very much surprised．

“Here I am，up here！”

Father and son looked up to the ceiling，and there on a beam sat the Talking Cricket．

“Oh，my dear Cricket，” said Pinocchio，bowing politely．

“Oh，now you call me your dear Cricket，but do you remember when you threw your hammer at me to kill me？”

“You are right，dear Cricket．Throw a hammer at me now．I deserve it！But spare my poor old father．”

“I am going to spare both the father and the son．I have only wanted to remind you of the trick you long ago played upon me，to teach you that in this world of ours we must be kind and courteous to others，if we want to find kindness and courtesy in our own days of trouble．”

“You are right，little Cricket，you are more than right，and I shall remember the lesson you have taught me．But will you tell how you succeeded in buying this pretty little cottage？”

“This cottage was given to me yesterday by a little Goat with blue hair．”

“And where did the Goat go？” asked Pinocchio．

“I don't know．”

“And when will she come back？”

“She will never come back．Yesterday she went away bleating sadly，and it seemed to me she said：‘Poor Pinocchio，I shall never see him again．．．the Shark must have eaten him by this time．’”

“Were those her real words？Then it was she—it was—my dear little Fairy，” cried out Pinocchio，sobbing bitterly．

After he had cried a long time，he wiped his eyes and then he made a bed of straw for old Geppetto．He laid him on it and said to the Talking Cricket：

“Tell me，little Cricket，where shall I find a glass of milk for my poor Father？”

“Three fields away from here lives Farmer John．He has some cows．Go there and he will give you what you want．”

Pinocchio ran all the way to Farmer John's house．The Farmer said to him：

“How much milk do you want？”

“I want a full glass．”

“A full glass costs a penny．First give me the penny．”

“I have no penny，” answered Pinocchio，sad and ashamed．

“Very bad，my Marionette，” answered the Farmer，“very bad．If you have no penny，I have no milk．”

“Too bad，” said Pinocchio and started to go．

“Wait a moment，” said Farmer John．“Perhaps we can come to terms．Do you know how to draw water from a well？”

“I can try．”

“Then go to that well you see yonder and draw one hundred bucketfuls of water．”

“Very well．”

“After you have finished，I shall give you a glass of warm sweet milk．”

“I am satisfied．”

Farmer John took the Marionette to the well and showed him how to draw the water．Pinocchio set to work as well as he knew how，but long before he had pulled up the one hundred buckets，he was tired out and dripping with perspiration．He had never worked so hard in his life．

“Until today，” said the Farmer，“my donkey has drawn the water for me，but now that poor animal is dying．”

“Will you take me to see him？” said Pinocchio．

“Gladly．”

As soon as Pinocchio went into the stable，he spied a little Donkey lying on a bed of straw in the corner of the stable．He was worn out from hunger and too much work．

After looking at him a long time，he said to himself：“I know that Donkey！I have seen him before．”

And bending low over him，he asked：“Who are you？”

At this question，the Donkey opened weary，dying eyes and answered in the same tongue：“I am Lamp-Wick．”

Then he closed his eyes and died．

“Oh，my poor Lamp-Wick，” said Pinocchio in a faint voice，as he wiped his eyes with some straw he had picked up from the ground．

“Do you feel so sorry for a little donkey that has cost you nothing？” said the Farmer．“What should I do—I，who have paid my good money for him？”

“But，you see，he was my friend．”

“Your friend？”

“A classmate of mine．”

“What，” shouted Farmer John，bursting out laughing．“What！You had donkeys in your school？How you must have studied！”

The Marionette，ashamed and hurt by those words，did not answer，but taking his glass of milk returned to his father．

From that day on，for more than five months，Pinocchio got up every morning just as dawn was breaking and went to the farm to draw water．And every day he was given a glass of warm milk for his poor old father，who grew stronger and better day by day．But he was not satisfied with this．He learned to make baskets of reeds and sold them．With the money he received，he and his father were able to keep from starving．

Among other things，he built a rolling chair，strong and comfortable，to take his old father out for an airing on bright，sunny days．

In the evening the Marionette studied by lamplight．With some of the money he had earned，he bought himself a secondhand volume that had a few pages missing，and with that he learned to read in a very short time．As far as writing was concerned，he used a long stick at one end of which he had whittled a long，fine point．Ink he had none，so he used the juice of blackberries or cherries．Little by little his diligence was rewarded．He succeeded，not only in his studies，but also in his work，and a day came when he put enough money together to keep his old father comfortable and happy．Besides this，he was able to save the great amount of fifty pennies．With it he wanted to buy himself a new suit．

One day he said to his father：

“I am going to the market place to buy myself a coat，a cap，and a pair of shoes．When I come back I'll be so dressed up，you will think I am a rich man．”

He ran out of the house and up the road to the village，laughing and singing．Suddenly he heard his name called，and looking around to see whence the voice came，he noticed a large snail crawling out of some bushes．

“Don't you recognize me？” said the Snail．

“Yes and no．”

“Do you remember the Snail that lived with the Fairy with Azure Hair？Do you not remember how she opened the door for you one night and gave you something to eat？”

“I remember everything，” cried Pinocchio．“Answer me quickly，pretty Snail，where have you left my Fairy？What is she doing？Has she forgiven me？Does she remember me？Does she still love me？Is she very far away from here？May I see her？”

At all these questions，tumbling out one after another，the Snail answered，calm as ever：

“My dear Pinocchio，the Fairy is lying ill in a hospital．”

“In a hospital？”

“Yes，indeed．She has been stricken with trouble and illness，and she hasn't a penny left with which to buy a bite of bread．”

“Really？Oh，how sorry I am！My poor，dear little Fairy！If I had a million I should run to her with it！But I have only fifty pennies．Here they are．I was just going to buy some clothes．Here，take them，little Snail，and give them to my good Fairy．”

“What about the new clothes？”

“What does that matter？I should like to sell these rags I have on to help her more．Go，and hurry．Come back here within a couple of days and I hope to have more money for you！Until today I have worked for my father．Now I shall have to work for my mother also．Good-by，and I hope to see you soon．”

The Snail，much against her usual habit，began to run like a lizard under a summer sun．

When Pinocchio returned home，his father asked him：

“And where is the new suit？”

“I couldn't find one to fit me．I shall have to look again some other day．”

That night，Pinocchio，instead of going to bed at ten o'clock waited until midnight，and instead of making eight baskets，he made sixteen．

After that he went to bed and fell asleep．As he slept，he dreamed of his Fairy，beautiful，smiling，and happy，who kissed him and said to him，“Bravo，Pinocchio！In reward for your kind heart，I forgive you for all your old mischief．Boys who love and take good care of their parents when they are old and sick，deserve praise even though they may not be held up as models of obedience and good behavior．Keep on doing so well，and you will be happy．”

At that very moment，Pinocchio awoke and opened wide his eyes．

What was his surprise and his joy when，on looking himself over，he saw that he was no longer a Marionette，but that he had become a real live boy！He looked all about him and instead of the usual walls of straw，he found himself in a beautifully furnished little room，the prettiest he had ever seen．In a twinkling，he jumped down from his bed to look on the chair standing near．There，he found a new suit，a new hat，and a pair of shoes．

As soon as he was dressed，he put his hands in his pockets and pulled out a little leather purse on which were written the following words：

The Fairy with Azure Hair returns

fifty pennies to her dear Pinocchio

with many thanks for his kind heart．

The Marionette opened the purse to find the money，and be-hold—there were fifty gold coins！

Pinocchio ran to the mirror．He hardly recognized himself．The bright face of a tall boy looked at him with wide-awake blue eyes，dark brown hair and happy，smiling lips．

Surrounded by so much splendor，the Marionette hardly knew what he was doing．He rubbed his eyes two or three times，wondering if he were still asleep or awake and decided he must be awake．

“And where is Father？” he cried suddenly．He ran into the next room，and there stood Geppetto，grown years younger overnight，spick and span in his new clothes and gay as a lark in the morning．He was once more Mastro Geppetto，the wood carver，hard at work on a lovely picture frame，decorating it with flowers and leaves，and heads of animals．

“Father，Father，what has happened？Tell me if you can，” cried Pinocchio，as he ran and jumped on his Father's neck．

“This sudden change in our house is all your doing，my dear Pinocchio，” answered Geppetto．

“What have I to do with it？”

“Just this．When bad boys become good and kind，they have the power of making their homes gay and new with happiness．”

“I wonder where the old Pinocchio of wood has hidden himself？”

“There he is，” answered Geppetto．And he pointed to a large Marionette leaning against a chair，head turned to one side，arms hanging limp，and legs twisted under him．

After a long，long look，Pinocchio said to himself with great content：

“How ridiculous I was as a Marionette！And how happy I am，now that I have become a real boy！”
