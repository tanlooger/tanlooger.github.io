小红帽





从前有一个乡下小姑娘，谁也没有她漂亮可爱。她的妈妈很宠爱她，而她的姥姥比她的妈妈更爱她。善良的姥姥在她生日那天送给她一顶小红帽，这小红帽给她戴上非常合适，于是大家都喊她小红帽。

有一天，她的妈妈做了些糕饼，对她说：

“小红帽，去看看姥姥，因为有人说她病了。拿这糕饼和这小罐黄油去送给她。”

小红帽立刻到她姥姥家里去，她姥姥住在另一个村庄里。

在经过一片树林时，她遇见了一只狡猾的老灰狼，老灰狼很想吃小红帽。可是它不敢，因为树林里有几个樵夫。它问她到哪儿去。可怜的小红帽不知道停下来听一只狼说话是危险的，对它说：

“我去看望我的姥姥，带给她糕饼和一小罐黄油，这是我妈妈送她的。”



“你姥姥住得很远吗？”狼问她。

“哦，是的，”小红帽说，“你看，一直往那边，磨坊的那边，在村里的第一所房子里。”

“很好！”狼说，“我也要去看望你姥姥，我从这条路走，你从那条路走，我们看看到底谁先到。”

狼赶紧从那条最短的路奔跑过去，小红帽却从那条最长的路走过去。她一边采着栗子玩，一边追赶着蝴蝶，用她所摘到的小花儿编成花束。

狼不久就到了姥姥的屋子前，它敲着门：笃，笃，笃。

“谁呀？”

“是你的外孙女，小红帽，”狼学着小红帽的声音说，“带着糕饼和一小罐黄油来给你，是我妈妈送你的。”

那善良的姥姥因为有点儿不舒服，睡在床上，对它说：

“拔了小栓子，门闩便下来了。”

狼拔了小栓子，门便开了。它扑向那善良的妇人，把她吃得干干净净，因为它已经有三天多没有吃东西了。随后它便把门关上，睡在姥姥的床上，等候小红帽到来。

过了一会儿，小红帽便来敲门了：笃，笃，笃。

“谁呀？”

小红帽听到了狼的粗大的声音，起初很害怕，不过她以为姥姥伤风了，就回答：

“是你的外孙女，小红帽，带着糕饼和一小罐黄油来给你，是我妈妈送给你的。”

狼把声音压低些对她说：

“拔了小栓子，门闩便下来了。”

小红帽拔了小栓子，门便开了。

那狼看见她进来，就躲在床上的被子底下对她说：

“把糕饼和那小罐黄油放在面包箱上，来和我同睡吧。”

小红帽脱了衣裳，爬上床去，她感到很奇怪。为什么姥姥脱了衣服是这个样子的？她对它说：

“姥姥，你的胳膊有这样大！”

“这样，抱起你来格外方便些，我的外孙女！”

“姥姥，你的腿有这样大！”

“这样，跑起路来格外方便些，我的孩子！”

“姥姥，你的耳朵有这样大！”

“这样，听起声音来格外方便些，我的孩子！”

“姥姥，你的眼睛有这样大！”

“这样，看起你来格外方便些，我的孩子！”

“姥姥，你的牙齿有这样大！”

“这样，才可以吃你呀！”

凶狠的狼说了这句话，就向小红帽扑去，想把她吃掉。正在这时，跑进来几个樵夫，把狼砍死了。

《小红帽》的故事流传年代较久，版本多达一百多个。此处中英文两个版本的故事结局略有出入。





林中睡美人





从前有一位国王和一位王后，他们因为没有孩子，心里很忧愁，忧愁得没法形容。他们走遍了四海：立愿，进香，什么都做过了，可是一点儿效果也没有。

谁知后来王后竟怀孕了，生了一个女儿。他们举行了一个盛大的洗礼，把国内的七位仙女都请来做小公主的教母。七位仙女按照当时仙女的礼俗，每人送她一份礼，这样，小公主就可以拥有一切无上的完美了。

行过洗礼，大家都回到王宫里，那里安排了盛大筵席宴请诸位仙女。她们每人面前都有一副极体面的食器：一个大的金匣子，其中有一把调羹、一柄餐叉和一把纯金的小刀，那小刀上还镶着金刚钻和红宝石。可是当她们坐下来的时候，忽然来了一位老仙女，她没有被邀请，因为五十年来，她从来没有离开过她居住的塔，大家总以为她不是死了，就是被邪法迷住了。

国王吩咐为她安排餐具，可是没法给她和别的仙女一样的金匣子。因为他们只制了七副，是专为那七位仙女制作的。那位老仙女以为他们看不起她，于是嘴里就说出些威吓的话来。其中有一位年轻的仙女恰巧坐在她旁边，听到了她的话，怕她要送些不幸的礼物给小公主。于是等到筵席一散，她就躲在壁幔后面，想最后发言，尽她的能力设法补救那老妇人所降的灾祸。

这时候，那些仙女开始赐福给公主了。那最年轻的仙女的礼物是使她成为世界第一美人；第二个仙女的礼物是使她有天使的智慧；第三个仙女的礼物是使她所做的一切都有杰出的风度；第四个仙女的礼物是使她能很优美地舞蹈；第五个仙女的礼物是使她有夜莺一般的歌喉；第六个仙女的礼物是使她拥有演奏各种乐器的技巧。

然后轮到那老仙女了，她一面说一面摇着头——这是因为怨恨，而不是因为年老。她说那公主将被纺锤刺破手，因而死掉。

这可怕的礼物使大家都为之颤抖，没有人不因此落泪。这时，那年轻的仙女从壁幔后面走出来，高声说道：

“你们安心吧，国王和王后，你们的女儿决不会因此致死的，固然我没有能力把前一位所说的话——公主将会被纺锤刺破手——完全推翻，可是她不会死，她只是沉睡一百年。一百年后，会有一位王子来使她苏醒。”

国王为了避免那老仙女说的不幸的命运降临，立刻发了一道圣旨：禁止任何人用纺锤纺线，或者在家里私藏纺锤，违者一律处以死刑。

在十五六年以后，有一回国王和王后到他们的一所别墅去，事情就发生了。那位公主在城堡中跑来跑去，从这一间屋子到那一间屋子，一直到了一座塔的顶上。她走进一间房间，那里有一位善良的老婆婆独自坐着，在用纺锤纺线。这善良的妇人从来没有听见过国王关于纺锤的禁令。

“你在那儿干什么，我的善良的老妇人？”公主问她。

“我在纺线，我美丽的孩子。”老婆婆回答，她不知道公主是谁。

“啊，这样好玩！”公主接着说，“你是怎样弄的？拿来给我，让我试试看能不能像你这样。”

她迫不及待地把那纺锤拿过来，拿了一会儿，完全没有想到老仙女所预言的话，她被纺锤刺破了手，晕倒了。

那个老婆婆吓坏了，高声喊救命。众人都从各处赶过来，用水洒在公主脸上。他们解开她的衣服，拍她的手，用药水擦她的太阳穴，可是都不能使她醒过来。

国王在嘈杂的人声中跑到楼上，记起了那仙女的预言，就猜到一定有什么事应和仙女的话发生了，他吩咐人把公主抬到宫中最精致的一间房中，放在一张金银镶镂的床上。

谁都得说她是一位天使，是那样的可爱，她的长眠对于她美丽的容貌毫无损害：她的脸还是红红的，嘴唇像珊瑚一般美丽，她只是闭着眼睛，人们可以听到她在微微地呼吸——这就可以表明她没有死去。国王吩咐让她安睡，直到她重新苏醒过来。



当公主出事的时候，那位救她的命、预言她将长睡一百年的好仙女正在马达干王国里，在一万二千法里(1)以外，但是她立刻从一个侏儒那儿得到了消息，那侏儒有双七法里靴子（就是穿了这双靴子，跨一步有七法里那么远）。

这位仙女立刻动身，乘了一辆群龙驾着的车子在一小时之后就赶到了。国王前去迎接她，扶她下车。她对于他所做的一切都很同意，可是仙女是有先见之明的，她想到当公主忽然苏醒时，如果这古堡中只有她孤零零的一个人，她一定会感到非常痛苦，于是就做了以下的布置。

仙女用她的仙杖将城堡中的人都一一点过（除了国王和王后）：女教师、宫娥、侍女、侍从、官员、内臣、御厨、仆人、侍卫、哨兵、奴仆、随从；她把厩中的马都点了；还有那些马夫、院中的大狗、小波夫（公主的小狗，它正睡在她的身旁）。她的仙杖点着他们时，他们就都睡过去了，要到公主醒来时他们才会醒，因为等她醒来时他们可以服侍她。就连那架在火上插着鹧鸪和山鸡的熏烤串也睡了过去，火也沉沉地睡着了。在片刻之中一切都安排停当，仙女们做事不会费许多工夫的。



这时国王和王后吻过他们的爱女，没有惊醒她，然后就离开了城堡。回到京城以后，他们又发了一道不准任何人到那里去的禁令。这禁令是没有必要的，因为在一瞬间，花园的四周长出许多的树木，大的，小的，有钩的，有刺的，互相盘结着，人犬都不能通过，这样一来，除了城堡的塔尖外，什么都看不见，而且就连那塔尖也只有在很远的地方才可以看见。这无疑是由于神力，这样一来，公主就可以在长睡的时候，不被过路人的好奇心所惊扰了。

过了一百年之后，有一位和睡着的公主不同族的王子来到附近打猎，他向人探问他所看见的、在森林中树梢顶上露出来的塔尖是什么。于是每个人便照各自听到的话来讲给他听：有的说这是住着鬼怪的古堡；有的说是一群妖精，他们把捉到的孩子都带到那儿去随便吃掉，因为只有他们能穿过树林，别人不能追他们。

那位王子不知道该相信哪种说法好，这时有一个老农对他说：

“我的王子，在五十多年前，我曾听父亲讲过，在这城堡中有位非常美丽的公主，她须要睡一百年，然后会有一位王子来将她唤醒，她是在等候这位王子。”

那青年王子听了这些话，很想去看看。他毫不迟疑，相信他能完成这场美丽的冒险，而且为爱情和荣誉所驱使，他决定立刻去看看里面到底是什么。

他走到了树林前，那儿的大树和荆棘都让出一条路来让他过去。他向城堡中走去，这座城堡是他在树林边看见的，更使他惊奇的是，他觉得没有一个人跟着他进来，因为在他经过后，那树林又合拢了。他继续前进，年轻又多情的王子总是十分勇敢的。他走进一所大庭院，在那里看见的一切使他感到恐惧，热血都几乎冰冷了。到处都静得可怕，到处呈现着死亡的景象，除了人和狗的躯体以外，没有别的东西。当他发现一个卫兵生疱的鼻子和红色的脸时，他才知道他们不过是熟睡着，在他们的酒杯中，还残留着几滴酒，只有这些可以证明他们是在饮酒时睡过去的。

他穿过一个大理石铺砌的天井，上了扶梯，走进大厅，看见卫兵整齐地列队站着，背着枪，在高声地打鼾。他走过了许多地方，到处都是熟睡着的达官贵妇，有的站着，有的坐着。他走进了一间金碧辉煌的房间，在一张挂着锦帐的床上，他看见一幅他从来没有看见过的美景：一位约莫十五六岁的公主，美丽的容貌容光焕发，神态庄严。他战战兢兢、满怀赞叹地向前走去，在她身旁跪了下来。

这时仙术已被解除，公主醒过来了，她温柔地看着他，似乎很满意的样子。

“是你吗，我的王子？”她对他说，“让你久等了。”

王子被这些话迷住了，尤其使他着迷的是她说话的态度，他竟不知道怎样来表示出他的快乐和他的感激。他郑重地对她说，他很爱她，比爱他自己更热烈。他话说得很少而且语无伦次，但却充满爱意。他比她更害羞。大家可不要奇怪，她想了好些时候，应当对他说些什么。这是显然的（虽然故事里没有说起），在她的长眠中，那位好仙女给了她许多快活的梦境。总之，他们谈了四个小时，却还没有说完他们要说的话的一半。

那时宫里的人畜都和公主同时醒来了。每个人都想起了自己的职务。因为他们并不都是陶醉在爱情里的，所以都几乎饿得要死了。宫娥们和他们一样地饿，忍耐不住，就高声地向公主喊道：用餐时间到了。

王子扶着公主起身，她穿着华丽的衣服——他不敢对她说她打扮得像他的祖母一般——她的古式的皱领很高，不过并没有因此减少丝毫的美丽。

他们走到一间四面都是镜子的厅中，然后就在那里进餐，公主的仆从侍候着他们。提琴和笛子合奏着古曲，非常优美，虽然这曲子已经有一百多年没有人演奏过了。餐后，为了不浪费时间，大总管立刻为他们在城堡内的小教堂里举行婚礼，宫娥替他们把帷幕拉开。

他们睡的时间很少，因为公主已经睡够了，不想再多睡，一到天明，王子便告别了她回到城中去，他的父亲正在想念着他。王子对他说，自己打猎时在树林中迷了路，睡在一个烧炭夫的茅屋里，那烧炭夫请他吃黑面包和干酪。那国王，他的父亲，是一个老实人，于是相信了他。可是他的母亲生性多疑，她发觉王子差不多每天都出去打猎，而每一次出去，总是找些话做借口，两三个夜晚不回家。她怀疑他已经有情人了。



王子和公主同居了两年多，有了两个孩子：大的是女孩子，名叫晨曦；小的是男孩子，名叫白昼，他比他的姐姐还要美。

那位王后为了得到王子的一些实话，常常对她的儿子说，他应当有爱人了，可是他总不敢把自己的秘密告诉她。他害怕她，虽然他也爱她——因为她是妖精族的人，国王和她结婚，就因为贪恋她家的财富。别人甚至在王宫里也低低地谈论，说她有妖精的嗜好，说她看见小孩子走过，就会控制不住自己去抓他们。因此王子始终不敢向她提起自己的事。

两年以后，国王死了，王子继承了王位，觉得自己已经做了主人，于是就公布了自己的婚事，隆重地去迎接王后——他的妻子——到宫中来。她坐在她的两个孩子之间，很体面地进了王城。

后来国王去和邻国的孔塔拉比大帝打仗。他把国政交给他的母后管理，郑重地把他的妻子和孩子托付给她，因为他整个夏天都要在战场上。他一走，那母后就把她的儿媳妇和孩子们送到林中一间村舍里，这样她就可以格外容易地满足她那可怕的欲望。几天之后，她也到了那儿。一个晚上，她对她的御厨总管说：

“我明天要把小晨曦当中饭吃。”

“啊，夫人！”御厨总管惊呼起来。

“我就要这样，”那位母后说，而且她说话用的是妖精看见鲜肉时忍不住流口水的语气，“我要把她用辣酱来蘸着吃。”

那可怜的人很容易就看出来，这妖精不是说笑话，于是就带着刀来到小晨曦房中。小晨曦那时已经四岁了，跳着笑着来到他面前，一双手攀住了他的颈项，向他要糖果吃。他不由得落下了眼泪，刀子便从他手中落下来。

于是他回到厨房天井里，宰了一只小绵羊，用美味的酱调和着。那位母后对他说，她从来没有吃过这样好吃的东西。

总管同时将小晨曦带走了，交给他的妻子，把她藏在厨房天井尽头处他妻子所住的小屋中。

一星期后，那位恶毒的母后又对御厨总管说：

“我要拿小白昼来当晚餐。”

他不说什么，决定照上一次的法子骗她。他去找小白昼，看见他手里拿着一把花剑正和一只大猴子打闹，虽然他只有三岁。他把他带到妻子那儿，藏在他姐姐藏着的地方，然后烧了一只很嫩的小山羊代替小白昼，这道菜被那妖精看作美味珍品。

一切都很平顺地过去了，可是有一晚，那恶母后又对御厨总管说：

“我要吃那王后，用上次吃孩子用的酱来调味。”

这一次那可怜的御厨总管不能再骗恶母后了。王后已经二十岁了，那睡眠中的一百年当然不算。她的皮肤洁白而美丽，但却有点儿老，他从什么兽园中可以找到一头动物去代替她呢？他决定了，为了保全自己的性命，他不得不去把王后的头割下来，于是跑到她的住处，准备立刻照决定的去办。他握着一把刀，一鼓作气地进了王后的房中。然而他不愿突然杀死她，便非常恭敬地把她母后的命令告诉她。

“照你的本分做吧，”她说着把脖子伸过去，“执行她的命令吧。让我可以再看见我的孩子们，我疼爱的可怜的孩子们。”因为她的孩子们被他无故带走以后，她以为他们早已死了。

“不不，王后！”那可怜的御厨总管泪流满面地回答说，“我不要你的命，我要让你重新看到你的孩子们，你可以到我的家里去，因为我把他们藏在家里了。现在，我要再骗一次老王后，给她烧一只小红母鹿来代替你。”

他立刻带她到自己的住所去，让她在那儿和她的孩子们拥抱哭泣。他去烧了一只红母鹿，让恶母后在晚餐的时候吃，她就跟真的吃青年王后一样津津有味地吃掉了那只红母鹿。

她对自己的暴行很满意，并且打算等国王回来时，告诉他说，有几只凶猛的豺狼已经把王后——他的妻子和他的两个孩子吃了。

有一晚，她照常在宫中的院子里和家畜场的四周徘徊，去闻些生人气味，无意中听到一间矮屋中有小白昼的哭声，原来王后——他的母亲因为他顽皮打了他。她还听到小晨曦为她弟弟讨饶的声音。

那妖精听出是王后和她的两个孩子的声音，知道先前受了欺骗，心中大怒，第二天一早，她下了一个使任何人听了都要震惊的命令：她吩咐人把一只大桶运到院子当中，桶中放满了癞蛤蟆、蝮蛇和蟒蛇，她要把王后和她的孩子们、御厨总管和他的妻子，以及他的使女都投到那个大桶中去。她下令把他们反绑着手带过去。

他们都站在那儿，而那些执行死刑的人也正预备将他们抛进大桶中。恰在这时，国王骑马走进宫来，别人都以为他不会这么早回来的。他下了马，大为惊异，忙问这可怕的情景是什么意思，没有人敢告诉他。这时那妖精看见国王已经回来，气急败坏，便自己返身投到大桶中去，片刻之间，就被那些她早先叫人放进去的可怕东西吃掉了。

国王不禁十分伤痛，因为她是他的母亲，可是不久他便从他的娇妻爱子身上得到了安慰。

灰姑娘





从前有一位贵族，他的妻子死了，又娶了一个继室。那是一个从来没有见过的最可恶最骄傲的妇人。她有两个女儿，什么都同她相像，连脾气也一样。贵族的前妻也有一个女儿，可是她非常温柔善良——这些好品行都是从她母亲那儿得来的，她母亲是世界上最好的女人。

继母到这个家里来不久，她的坏脾气就显露出来了。她不能忍受贵族前妻的女儿身上有许多好品行，因为她的好品行使继母自己的女儿显得益发可憎了。继母要这女孩子做家中的一切苦工，要她刷地板、洗扶梯、洗餐具，要她擦洗她们母女三人的卧房。她睡在屋顶阁楼中，拿干草当褥子，而她的两个姐姐却占着铺了木地板的房间和最时兴的床，还有可以从头照到脚的大镜子。

那可怜的女孩儿暗暗地受着苦，不敢告诉她的父亲，因为他准会责骂她，他完全听妻子的话。



她做完了她的事，就待在烟囱旁边，坐在灰堆里，因此家里人都叫她“煨灶猫”。那第二个女儿没有她大姐姐那样粗野，只叫她“灰姑娘”。可是那灰姑娘虽然穿着破衣衫，却比两个姐姐美丽百倍。她们即使穿了极华丽的衣裳，也赶不上她。

那时，国王的儿子举行舞会，把所有的阔人都请来了。我们这两位小姐也在被邀之列，因为她们是当地有名的人物。她们多快乐啊，整天选择最时髦的衣饰。这给灰姑娘添了许多麻烦，因为她要烫姐姐们的衬衣，给她们缝花边儿。而她们呢，只管一直谈论应当穿什么式样的衣裙。

“我呢，”大姐姐说，“我要穿我的红天鹅绒衣服，衬上英国花边。”

“我呢，”二姐姐说，“我只要穿我平常穿的绣裙，另外，我还要披上我的金花外套，还要加上我的钻石项圈，那是最贵重的。”

她们请来了最好的美容师，做了两重高的发髻，套上有皱边的帽子。她们叫灰姑娘给她们提些意见，因为她很有眼力。灰姑娘用最好的评语赞美她们，甚至还给她们梳头，她们很愿意她这样做。

当她正在为她们梳头的时候，她们对她说：

“灰姑娘，你愿意和我们一同到舞会去吗？”

“哎呀，小姐们，你们同我开玩笑了，我哪里配！”

“对啊，你想，一个煨灶猫也参加舞会，这不是天大的笑话吗？”

换了别人，早就要把她们的头发弄乱了，可是灰姑娘的脾气是很温和的，她依旧把她们的头发梳得很光滑。她们差不多两天没有吃饭，她们快乐极了。她们弄断了一打多的束腰带，因为她们想要竭力把腰身束细，而且她们还一天到晚照镜子。

后来，那快乐的一天到了。她们出门去参加舞会，灰姑娘一直看着她们，直到看不见时，她哭了。她的教母看见她流泪，就问她为什么哭。

“我想……我想……”她呜咽着泣不成声了。

她的教母是一位仙女，对她说：

“你想参加舞会，是不是？”

“啊，是呀。”灰姑娘长叹着说。

“那么，你乖乖的不要哭，我可以让你去，”她领她来到她的房中对她说，“到园中给我采一个南瓜来。”

灰姑娘立刻去选了一个最好的南瓜来交给教母，却不懂这南瓜怎么能使她到舞会去。

教母把南瓜挖空了，只剩下一个空壳子，她用她的仙杖一点，那南瓜立刻变成了一辆华丽的镀金马车。

接着她去看了看捕鼠器，看见那里面有六只小老鼠，都还活着。她叫灰姑娘悄悄地打开笼门，每只老鼠跑出来的时候，她用仙杖点一点，于是每一只小老鼠都变成了一匹骏马，这样六匹马排成了很好看的一队，都是美丽的鼠灰色斑点的。

用什么东西变马夫呢？教母有点儿为难了，于是灰姑娘说：

“让我去看看，另外一只捕鼠器里可能有老鼠，我们可以把它变成马夫。”

“你说得不错，”教母说，“你去看看。”

灰姑娘把另外一只捕鼠器拿过来，里面有三只大老鼠。那仙女从中选了一只。因为那只大老鼠有许多胡须，教母用仙杖一点，它就变成了一个肥胖的马夫，长着一嘴的胡子。

“到花园里去，”随后她又说，“在水缸背后你可以找到六只蜥蜴，把它们拿来给我。”

灰姑娘立刻把它们拿来，教母把它们变成了六个仆人。他们立刻站在马车后面，他们的衣服镶着花边儿，好像是一向过着这种生活似的。

于是仙女对灰姑娘说：“好了，现在已经安排停当，可以到舞会去了，你不就快乐了吗？”

“是呀，可是难道我就穿这衣裳去吗？”

教母只用仙杖点了一点，灰姑娘的衣裳就变成了金银色，还镶着珠宝。教母随后又给她一双玻璃的小舞鞋，世界上最美丽的小舞鞋。



灰姑娘这样装扮好了以后，上了马车，教母又对她说，上面的一切东西都不能维持过半夜，并警告她，要是她在舞会上延迟了一分钟，她的马车就会变回南瓜；她的马就变回小老鼠；她的马夫就会变回大老鼠；她的仆人就会变回蜥蜴；她的衣裳也会回复原状。

她答应她的教母不到半夜就离开舞会。她出发时欣喜若狂。

王子得到报告，说有一位无人知晓的公主到了，于是就立刻跑出去迎接她。他扶她下车，引她到大厅里，宾客都聚集在那里。

这时人们立刻都安静下来：大家停止了跳舞，弹琴的停止了奏乐，每个人都欣赏着这不知名女子的惊人美丽。除了那“啊！她是多么美丽！”的低语以外，一点儿声息也没有。

老国王本人也定睛看着她，对王后说，他许久没有看见过这样美丽、这样可爱的人了。

那些贵妇人都仔仔细细地看她的头饰和衣裳，打定主意在第二天仿制，她们准备选最美丽的衣料，叫最好的裁缝来做。

王子请她坐到最尊贵的座位上去，然后请求和她跳舞。她跳得那样美妙，使大家愈发佩服她了。

一席丰盛的筵席摆下了，王子却一点儿也吃不下，他默默地看着她，他的心已经被她抢去了。灰姑娘走过去坐在她的两位姐姐旁边，对她们很客气。她把王子给她的橘子和橙子分给她们吃。这使她们很惊异，因为她们根本就不认识她。

灰姑娘和她们谈话的时候，忽然听见钟敲响了，时间已快接近半夜，于是她就向宾客们深深地行了礼，匆匆地走了。

她回到家中就去找她的教母，向她道过谢以后，她说第二天的舞会她还想去，因为王子已经邀请了她。正当她和教母谈论舞会的经过时，她的两个姐姐敲门了。灰姑娘出来开了门。

“你们去了这么久！”她一边向她们说，一边打着呵欠，揉着眼睛，伸着懒腰，好像刚从梦中醒来一般。其实自从她们出门以后，她一刻也没有睡过。

“假如你也在舞会上，”她的一个姐姐对她说，“你就不会觉得疲倦。舞会上来了一位美丽的公主，那种美丽是我从没有见过的。她对我们很客气。她还给了我们橙子和橘子。”

灰姑娘快乐极了！她问她们那位公主叫什么名字，可是她们回答说没有一个人知道。那王子还因此非常烦恼呢，他宁愿舍弃一切来知道她的名字。

“那么她是很美丽的啦！”灰姑娘微笑着说，“天啊！你们多么幸福！我不能见见她吗？啊！夏洛特姐姐，你可以把你每天穿的黄色裙子借给我吗？”

“不借！”夏洛特小姐说，“我怎会把裙子借给像你这样的一个煨灶猫呢？那样，我真是发疯了！”

灰姑娘很愿意被她拒绝，她对于这拒绝很满意，因为假使她的姐姐真的把裙子借给了她，反倒使她很为难了。

第二天，两个姐姐到舞会去，灰姑娘也去了，她这次比第一次穿得更美丽了。

王子一刻也不离开她，不停地向她低声说话。

灰姑娘快乐得把教母吩咐她的话都忘了，她起初还以为连十一点都没到，哪知时钟开始打十二下了。她突然起身，像小鹿一般地奔跑出去。王子追她，可是没有追上。她落下了一只玻璃舞鞋，王子便把那只玻璃舞鞋郑重地拾起来。

灰姑娘到家时，几乎气都喘不过来了，没有马车，也没有仆从，穿着破衣衫，除了一只玻璃舞鞋外，她的华丽衣服都没有了，另外一只舞鞋也丢了。

王子问守宫门的守卫有没有看见一位公主出去。他们回答说，除了看见一个衣衫褴褛的姑娘出去以外，什么也没有看见，而那姑娘与其说她是一位公主，不如说她像一个乡下姑娘。

两个姐姐从舞会回来，灰姑娘问她们是不是和昨晚一样受到优待，那美丽的公主是不是也到了。两个姐姐对她说是的，可是到时钟敲十二下的时候，她就立刻跑走了，跑得那样仓促，把一只小玻璃舞鞋都落下了，那舞鞋是世界上最美丽的舞鞋。她们又说，王子把那小玻璃舞鞋拾起来，不停地看着，从这点看来，无疑地，他已经十分爱那小舞鞋的主人了。



她们的话是对的，因为在几天之后，王子下命令：谁能恰好穿上那只玻璃舞鞋，他就和谁结婚。

他们先给公主们试，然后给公爵的女儿们和宫中的女子们试，可是都不成功。后来拿到灰姑娘的两位姐姐家里去，她们用尽平生之力把脚塞到那只舞鞋里去，可是终究还是不成功。

灰姑娘看着她们，她认识自己的舞鞋，于是笑着说：“让我看看可不可以穿上吧。”

两个姐姐笑起来，嘲弄她。那位被派来试鞋子的人仔细看着灰姑娘，觉得她长得十分美丽，就说他接到命令，任何女子都可以一试，并没有例外的。他请灰姑娘坐下来，把那只舞鞋套到她的脚上，他看见她很容易就穿上了它，十分合适。

她的两个姐姐大为惊奇。可是尤其使她们惊奇的是，灰姑娘从衣袋中又取出一只舞鞋来穿在另一只脚上。

这时教母也赶到了，她用仙杖在灰姑娘的衣裳上点了一点，那衣裳立刻变得比从前更华丽了。

这时两个姐姐才认出她就是在舞会里所见的那个最美丽的人。她们都拜倒在她的脚下，求她饶恕她们从前那样虐待她。

灰姑娘扶她们起来，拥抱着她们说，她已经完全饶恕她们了，还要请她们永久地深深地爱她。她们引她到青年王子那儿，他觉得她更加美丽了。几天后，他们便结婚了。

灰姑娘的善良和她的美丽一样打动人，她叫她的两个姐姐住到宫里去，就在同一天，让她们和宫中的两位贵人结了婚。





穿长靴的猫





从前有个磨粉匠死后，留给他的三个儿子一份遗产，这份产业一共只有他的磨坊、他的驴子和他的猫。

三个儿子立刻就把它们分了，没有公证人，也没有代理人，什么人也没有请。要是请那些人，他们一下子就会把这份可怜的遗产吃光的。

大儿子分得了磨坊，二儿子拿去了驴子，小儿子没有东西可以拿，只分到了一只猫。那小儿子继承了那么少的遗产，很是悲伤。

“大哥二哥，”他自言自语说，“你们很体面，可以合伙做生意，过两人的生活。可是我呢，一旦吃了我的猫，用猫皮做一双暖手筒，我就只好饿死了。”

那只猫听了他的话，装作没听见，用一种又沉静又庄重的口气对他说：

“你不要自寻烦恼，我的主人。你只要给我一只口袋，再替我做一双长靴，让我到林子里去，你就知道，你不会像你所想的那样穷苦。”



虽然主人不十分相信猫的话，可是他看见过，它捉耗子时十分灵巧——它能直立起来或者躺在面粉中装死，因此他想它对于他的贫困也许有些帮助，所以没有完全失望。

那只猫得到了它所需要的东西以后，立刻穿上了长靴，把口袋围挂在颈上，用前爪握住了袋口的绳子，走进一座养兔场。那里有许多兔子。它在口袋里放了些糠和莴苣，躺着装死，等着那些年轻的兔子——它们不大懂得世上的狡计，会走进口袋中去吃它投放的东西。

它一睡下，就达到了它的目的：一只年轻的傻兔子走进了它的口袋，那猫立刻把袋口的绳子抽紧，捉住了它，毫不留情地杀死了它。

猫得意地带了它捉来的兔子，到王宫里去见国王。它被引到国王的住处，便进去向国王深深地鞠躬说：

“陛下，这一只野兔子，我是奉了我家主人卡拉拔侯爵（这名字是它为主人捏造出来的）的命令来献给陛下的。”

“对你主人说，”国王回答他，“我谢谢他，因为他使我很快乐。”

又一天，猫出去躲在麦田中，照前次一样握住打开了口的口袋，不久有一对鹧鸪走进口袋里，它抽紧了绳子，把它们双双捉住。然后它便去见国王，照上次送兔子那样送上鹧鸪，国王很快乐地接受了那一对鹧鸪，又赏赐了它一些金银。

那只猫继续用这个办法，把它替主人猎得的东西献给国王，这样过了两三个月。

有一天，猫知道国王要和他的女儿——世界上最美丽的公主到河滨去郊游，它就对主人说：

“假如你肯听我的话，你的运气就来了。你只要到河里去洗个澡，那地方我会指示给你的，别的事让我来处理。”

那位被称作卡拉拔的侯爵听了猫的话，照着去做了，也不知将来怎样。

当他在洗澡的时候，国王刚巧经过，于是那只猫就拼命大叫：

“救命！救命！卡拉拔侯爵要溺死了！”

国王听见了这呼声，从车窗中伸出头来，认出了那只常常带东西来送给他的猫，就命令卫队立刻去救卡拉拔侯爵。

当他们把那可怜的卡拉拔侯爵从河中救起时，那只猫就走到车边，告诉国王说，他主人在洗澡时，有许多强盗跑来。虽然他拼命喊“捉强盗”，可是那些强盗还是把可怜的侯爵藏在大石下的衣裳抢了去。

国王立刻吩咐他的管衣裳的执事，去把他最华丽的衣裳拿一套来给卡拉拔侯爵。国王拥抱了他一千次，等到他穿好了衣裳，他的风度格外好（因为他本来是俊美的），国王的女儿很喜欢他。当卡拉拔侯爵恭敬而温柔地看了她三次以后，她就暗中爱上了他。

国王让侯爵坐进车中，一同去游览。那只猫看见它的计策快要成功了，开心极了，在前面跑着，当它遇到农夫们在草地上割草时，就对他们说：

“你们这些割草的好百姓，假如你们不对国王说你们收割的草地是卡拉拔侯爵的，他将会把你们都斩成肉酱！”

国王经过，问那些割草的人，他们所割的草是谁的。

“这是卡拉拔侯爵的。”他们同声回答，因为那只猫说的话使他们吓坏了。

“你有这样好的产业。”国王对卡拉拔说。

“你看，陛下，”侯爵回答，“这草地每年可以出产许多的草。”

那猫继续向前走，来到一些割麦的人前面，对他们说：

“你们这些割麦的好百姓，假如你们不对国王说这些麦子都是卡拉拔侯爵的，他将要把你们斩成肉酱。”

不久国王来了，想知道他所看见的这些麦子是谁的。

“这是卡拉拔侯爵的。”割麦的人回答。

国王格外喜欢侯爵了。

那只猫在车子前面跑，遇见什么人都说同样的话，国王对于卡拉拔侯爵的豪富大为惊叹。

猫最后来到一座精美的城堡前面，这座城堡是一个妖精的，他的富裕声名谁都知道：原来那国王的车子一路经过的地方都是这城堡的主人的。

那只猫小心地问清楚这妖精是谁，有什么本领，然后就要求和他谈话，说它既来到他的城堡，不去拜访他是失礼的。

那妖精就尽了妖精所能做到的文雅礼节接见它，请它坐下。

“有人对我讲，”那只猫说，“你有变化各种动物的本领，比方说，你能够一下子把自己变成一只狮子，或是一头大象。”

“真的，”那妖精鲁莽地说，“而且我可以证明给你看，你将看见我变成一只狮子。”

那只猫顿时看见一只狮子在它面前出现，吓得立刻跳上房檐去，不过这很不方便，而且很危险，因为它的长靴在瓦片上不好走。

过了一会儿，猫知道那妖精已经回复了原形，才敢下来，它承认当时很害怕。

“有人还对我讲，”那猫说，“可是我不相信——他们说你还有变成极小的动物的本领，譬如说变成一只耗子或是田鼠！我以为这在你是完全不可能的。”

“不可能？”妖精回答，“你看着吧！”说着，他立刻变成一只耗子，在地板上奔跑。

那只猫看见这种情形，立刻扑上去，一口把他吞了下去。

不久国王经过这座精美的城堡，很想进去。那只猫听见了吊桥上辚辚的车声，便跑上去迎接他们，并且向国王说：

“欢迎陛下来到卡拉拔侯爵的城堡！”

“怎么，我的侯爵，”那国王惊呼起来，“这城堡也是你的吗？这座院落四周的一切建筑是再好也没有的了。我们到里面去，好吗？”

侯爵走在前面，扶着公主，后面跟着国王。他们走进大厅，看见大厅里摆放着丰盛的筵席，这筵席是妖精为他的朋友们准备的，那些朋友今天应该来看他，可是他们这时都不敢进来，因为国王在这里。

国王因为喜爱侯爵的好品格，更因为他的女儿一味地爱着他，又因为看见他有富裕的财产，所以在饮了五六杯酒以后，就对侯爵说：

“卡拉拔侯爵，你做不做我的女婿，这完全随你自己。”

侯爵深深地向国王行了几个礼，领受了国王赐给他的恩典，当天就和公主结了婚。

那只猫已经成了大勋爵，除了高兴时捉捉耗子玩以外，再也不去捉耗子了。





小拇指





从前有一个樵夫和他的妻子，他们有七个孩子，都是男孩儿，最大的只有十岁，最小的只有七岁。人们都很奇怪，那樵夫为什么在这样短的时间里会有这么多小孩子。其实这是因为他的妻子生得勤，而且每次分娩时至少生两个孩子。

夫妻俩都很贫苦，七个孩子给他们的生活带来了困难，因为他们当中还没有一个能够独立生活。使夫妻俩更发愁的是，那个最小的孩子身体很瘦弱，而且难得说话，因此，他们就把他看作是一个笨蛋。那孩子生得很小，生下来时几乎只有一个拇指那么大，因此他们就叫他小拇指。

这可怜的孩子是家中受欺侮的对象，随便出了什么事，他总是挨骂。然而他却是他弟兄当中最伶俐最聪明的一个，虽然不常开口，听得却很多。

有一年收成很坏，闹起了饥荒，穷人们只好抛弃自己的孩子。一天晚上，孩子们睡着时，这樵夫和他的妻子坐在炉旁，樵夫很痛心地对妻子说：

“你看得很明白，我们已经不能抚养我们的孩子了。我不忍心看着他们饿死，决定明天把他们抛在森林里。这是很容易做的，趁他们捆绑木柴不注意时，我们悄悄走开就是了。”

“啊！”樵夫的妻子叹着气说，“你忍心丢掉自己的孩子吗？”

她的丈夫又重新把自己的困难说了一遍，可这是白说，她总以为这样做不好。虽然她很穷，可却是他们的妈妈。但是她仔细一想，与其亲眼看着孩子们饿死，还不如抛弃他们为好。她只好答应了他，然后伏到床上痛哭起来。

他们所说的话，小拇指都听见了，因为当他睡在床上的时候，他觉得父母在谈论他们的事，就立刻轻轻起床，偷偷地躲在他父亲的椅子下面偷听，没被他们看见。接着他重新上了床，一刻也没有睡着，心想他应当怎么办。一清早他就起身跑到一条溪边，把细小洁白的鹅卵石满满地装了好几口袋，然后回了家。

他们出发了，小拇指一句也没有把他听到的话告诉他的哥哥们。

他们进了一座很深的森林，在这森林中，十步以外便不能互相看见了。那樵夫就砍起树来，他的孩子们去捡树枝，捆成柴束。爸爸和妈妈看见他们正在工作，就悄悄地跑了，很快从一条曲折的小路溜了出去。

当那些孩子觉察到只剩下他们时，就拼命地狂呼大哭起来。小拇指听凭他们呼喊着，他知道他怎样可以回家，因为他来的时候，沿路丢下了他口袋中细小洁白的鹅卵石。他对他们说：

“不要慌，我的哥哥们，我们的爸妈已经把我们抛弃在这里，可是我要平平安安地带你们回去，你们只要跟着我走就是了。”

他们都跟着他，他把他们从来的原路带回家。他们不敢立刻进门去，只贴着门听听爸爸和妈妈的谈话。

当樵夫和他的妻子到家时，庄主送了十块钱来，这是他从前欠他们的，而他们早已不指望他会归还了。这十块钱救了他们的命，因为他们几乎要饿死了。

樵夫立刻叫他的妻子到肉店里去。他们好久没有尝到肉味了，就买了足有两人平常吃的三倍的肉。

他们吃完饭后，那樵夫的妻子说：“哎！我们可怜的孩子们现在不知在哪里了，如果他们在，一定会快乐地把我们吃剩的东西吃了。可是偏是你，威廉，你要丢了他们。我早已说过，我们将来一定会后悔的。现在他们在林子里不知怎样了！哎！我的上帝，他们也许已经给豺狼吃掉了！你真不是人，竟这样丢掉你的孩子们！”

樵夫最后发脾气了，因为她接连说了二十多次他们会后悔和她以前的话没错这一类话。他威吓她，说她假如再不住口的话就要打她。



其实樵夫恐怕比妻子更忧愁，可是她这样唠叨，他就心烦起来，因为他和别的男子一样，爱听女人好听的话，而痛恨直爽的话。

那樵夫的妻子流着泪说：“啊啊！我的孩子们在哪里啊，我的可怜的孩子们！”

她这样地喊着，愈喊愈响，门外那些孩子听见了，就一齐高喊起来：“我们在这里！我们在这里！”

她立刻跑去替他们开门，拥抱他们，叫着：“我亲爱的孩子。我亲爱的孩子们，我能再看见你们，是多么快乐啊。你们一定很疲劳，很饿了。而你，比爱洛，你是这样的脏，过来，我给你洗冼。”

比爱洛是她的长子，她最爱他，因为他的头发是红褐色的，而她的头发也有点儿红褐色。

他们坐下来吃饭，胃口好极了，这使他们的爸爸妈妈很欢喜。他们还告诉爸妈，说他们在林中多么恐慌，他们差不多是齐声说的。

爸爸妈妈快乐地再次看见自己的孩子围绕在身边，可是等到十块钱用完，他们的快乐也完了。这时候，他们重新陷入了和以前一样的忧愁中，决意再次抛弃他们的孩子。为了达到他们的目的，他们要把孩子们领到比第一次更远的地方去。

他们商量这件事的时候，没有好好地保守秘密，他们的话又被小拇指听见了，他打定主意照老法子办。可是虽然他很早就想去拾小鹅卵石，却不能达到目的，因为他看见门锁着。

正在他想不出办法的时候，樵夫的妻子给了他们每人一个面包做早餐，他便想起他可以把面包撕成小块，代替小鹅卵石丢在经过的路上，于是他把自己的一块面包放在口袋里。

爸爸和妈妈领孩子们到了一座森林的最深最暗的地方，趁他们干活的时候，从一条小路上偷偷溜走了。小拇指一点儿也不害怕，因为他相信他可以很容易就依着他丢面包屑的路回去。可是他很惊异，因为一点儿面包屑也找不到：原来面包屑都被鸟儿吃完了。

孩子们伤心地呆望着，他们在林中彷徨着，愈走愈深。黑夜来了，大风起了，他们非常恐惧，仿佛只听到豺狼在四周狂嗥，立刻要吞食他们。他们不敢说话，也不敢回头来看一看。后来天又下起倾盆大雨，他们的衣服都湿透了。他们一步一滑，在泥泞中跌倒，又满身污泥地站起，他们不知道怎么办才好。

小拇指爬到一棵树顶上去，想在上面看看是不是可以看见什么东西。他看来看去，看见有一点儿像烛光那么小的光，可是这点儿光是在森林的远方。于是他就下来，可是他一落到地上，那光又看不见了，因此他很烦恼。可是当他和哥哥们向发光的地方走了一会儿，他又看见那点儿光从林中显现出来了。

他们最后走到了那所有光的房屋。他们一路上产生了不少恐慌，因为他们时常迷失了那灯光的方向，常常跌到溪涧中去。他们敲门，一位善良的妇人开了门。她问他们要什么。小拇指告诉她说，他们是贫苦的孩子，在森林中迷了路，求她收容他们过一夜。

那妇人看见他们都生得很好看，就哭起来，对他们说：“哎哟！我的可怜的孩子们，你们从哪里来的？你们要知道，这是一个妖精的住宅，他要吃小孩子的！”

“哎哟，太太！”小拇指回答，浑身战栗着，他的哥哥们也都战栗起来，“我们如何是好呢？假如今夜你不让我们寄宿，林中的豺狼一定会把我们吃了，因此我们宁愿被那位先生吃了，如果你能向他求情，或许他会可怜我们的。”

那妖精的妻子心想，她可以设法把他们藏起来，藏到第二天早上。于是她就答应了让他们进来，引他们到一个火炉边，使他们可以取暖，因为她已经烧了一整只羊做妖精的晚餐了。

他们正在取暖的时候，忽然听见门被人重重地敲了两三下。这是妖精回来了。他的妻子立刻叫他们躲在床下，然后去开门。



妖精先问晚餐有没有预备好，酒有没有斟满，然后他就吃喝起来。羊肉还是生的，可是他喜欢这样吃。他嗅来嗅去，说他闻到生人气了。

“这一定是小牛的气味，我刚才替你宰的。”他的妻子说。

“我闻着生人气了，我再对你说一遍，”那妖精斜眼看着她说，“我猜这里一定有什么东西。”

他说着，离开桌子一直向床边走过去。

“啊！”他喊着，“原来如此，你欺骗我，可恶的女人！我要吃你很容易的！你真是个老畜生！这些猎物来得正好，可以招待我的三位朋友，他们这几天说要来看我。”

他把他们一个个从床下拖出来。这些可怜的孩子都跪下来求他饶命。可是他们遇到的是一个最残忍的妖精，他哪里会可怜他们，眼巴巴地要吃了他们。他对他的妻子说，要把他们切成小块的肉，要她弄些好酱油。

他去拿了一把大刀来，走到孩子们的身边，他左手拿着一块长石头，把刀子在那上面磨快。当他抓住了一个小孩子的时候，他的妻子就对他说：“你为什么这时动起手来呢？难道明天都等不及吗？”

“闭嘴，”妖精说，“明天我还是要杀他们的。”

“可是你已经有这么多的肉了。”他的妻子说，“一头小牛、两只羊、半只猪。”

“你说得有理，”妖精说，“让他们好好地吃一顿饭，这样他们可以不掉膘，然后领他们睡觉去。”

那善良的妇人心中大乐，给他们吃了一顿很丰盛的晚餐，可是他们都吃不下，他们怕极了。

至于那妖精，他重新坐下来喝酒，快乐地想着他有这样的好菜留下来款待他的朋友们。他比平常多喝了十二杯酒，不久他就醉了，不能不去睡了。

这妖精有七个女儿，她们都还幼小。这些小妖精脸色都很好，因为她们和她们的父亲一样是吃生肉的。她们有小小的灰色圆眼睛、弯鼻子、大嘴巴、长牙齿，这牙齿非常锐利，又互相离开得很远。虽然她们还不太凶恶，但是已经很会做坏事了，她们会咬破小孩子的血管来吸他们的血。

她们早已睡了，七个人睡在一张大床上，每个人头上都带着一个金箍。就在这房中，有一张同样大小的床，妖精的妻子就叫那七个孩子睡在那儿，然后她到她丈夫身边去睡。

小拇指看见妖精的女儿每人头上都有一个金箍，他恐怕那妖精要反悔今晚没有杀了他和他的哥哥们，就在半夜里起来，脱下了他自己和哥哥们的睡帽，轻轻地戴在妖精的女儿们头上，同时把她们的金箍脱下来，戴在自己和六个哥哥的头上，这样妖精会误认为他们是他的女儿，而把自己的女儿当作他们，因为他很想割他们的颈项。

果然不出所料，半夜里妖精醒了，心中很后悔没有把他们在晚上杀了，而要等到明天早上。因此他一跳就跳下了床，拿起了他的大刀。他说：“我去看看小家伙这时候怎样了，我做事老是不爽快。”

于是他偷偷地进了他女儿的卧室，走近那七个小孩子睡觉的床，除了小拇指外，别人都已睡着了。那妖精先用手摸摸他哥哥们的头，后来又摸他的头，这时候他真恐慌极了。那妖精摸到了那些金箍，说：“真是的，我几乎犯了大错误！这一定是晚上酒喝得太多的缘故。”

然后他走到他的女儿们的床边，摸到了那些小睡帽，那是小拇指和哥哥们的东西。

“哈！”他喊着，“好东西在这里！大胆地干吧！”

他这样说着，就不慌不忙地把他七个女儿的喉管割断了。他圆满地干完了这事，又回去睡了。

小拇指一听见妖精的鼾声响起来，立刻叫醒了他的哥哥们，叫他们赶快穿起衣服来跟他走。他们轻轻地走到院子里，跳过了围墙。他们几乎通宵奔走，一路颤抖着，也不知道自己在向哪个方向去。

妖精早晨醒了，对他的妻子说：“你上楼去宰掉你昨夜收容的那些小家伙吧。”

她听错了她丈夫的话，以为丈夫叫她去给孩子们穿衣服，于是大为诧异，想不到他会对她说出这种话来。她上了楼，大吃一惊，只看见她的女儿们都死了。

她第一件事就是晕倒（因为当时的女人遇到这样的事，总是首先这样）。那妖精恐怕她做事时间太久，跑上楼去帮她。当他看见这种可怕的景象时，也同妻子一样惊恐。

“啊！我做了什么？”他喊着，“我要立刻叫这些坏家伙来偿命！”

他立刻在妻子的鼻子里灌了一些冷水，使她清醒过来，对她说：“赶快把我的七法里靴子拿来，我要去捉住那些孩子。”

他出发了，向各方乱跑，最后他走上了那些可怜孩子走的路，看见他们已经离他们爸爸的茅屋不到一百米了。孩子们看见那妖精从这座山跨到那座山，跑过河流正像他们跨过小溪那样容易。小拇指看见附近有一个岩洞，就叫哥哥们躲了进去，自己在他们后面爬着走，不时观察妖精的举动。

那妖精因为白白走了这许多路，十分疲倦（因为那七法里靴穿起来很让人疲劳），不得不休息了。他恰巧坐在那些小孩子躲着的岩石上。他十分疲倦，不久就睡熟了，又打着那种可怕的鼾声，使孩子们异常害怕，正如昨夜他要拿刀杀他们的时候一样。

小拇指没有他的哥哥们那样恐慌，他叫他们在妖精酣睡的时候赶快跑回家去，不要管他。他们听了他的话，立刻跑回家去了。

小拇指走到妖精身旁，把他的靴子轻轻地脱下，自己穿上了。那靴子是很长很大的，可是因为是仙靴，可以随人的脚的大小而伸缩，因此他穿上去刚刚好，好像是为他定做的一般。

他径直向妖精的家中走去，看见妖精的妻子在被杀的女儿们身旁哭着。

“你的丈夫，”小拇指对她说，“现在很危险，因为他已经被一大队强盗捉去了，强盗们说：要是他不把他的金银献给他们，他们就要杀了他。当他们将刀搁在他的肩上时，他看见了我，就叫我来告诉你他的处境，叫你把所有的金银都交给我，一点儿不要剩，否则他们会毫不怜悯地杀了他的。因为事情很急，他叫我穿了他的七法里靴赶来，你看这就是。这样可以使我走得快一点儿，并且可以证明我不是骗子。”

那好妇人非常着急，立刻把她所能找到的钱都交给他，因为那妖精虽然要吃小孩子，对她来说却是一个好丈夫。小拇指满载了那妖精的财产，急急忙忙回到他父亲的家里，在那里大受欢迎。




有许多人认为事情不是这样的，他们说小拇指从没有欺骗过妖精，他只是正当地拿了他的那双七法里靴，因为他靠着那双靴子可以追上哥哥们。他们说他们从可靠的证人口中听来，那些人甚至在樵夫家中喝过水吃过东西。他们又对我们切切实实地说，小拇指穿上了妖精的靴子以后，就到宫中去，因为他知道那边大家正在着急，原来有一支军队在二百法里外打仗，大家渴望听到那里战事的好消息。

他们说，他去找国王，对国王说，要是他希望当天有人把消息带回来，他可以办到。国王答应他，如果他能办到，一定会给他许多金钱。

小拇指当天晚上就把消息带回来了，这第一次的送信使他出了名，他要什么就能拿到什么，他替国王传递命令给军队，国王很慷慨地给他报酬。

他做了一段时间的通讯员，积攒下了许多钱，就回来见父亲，家中的人和他重新见面，这番快乐是可想而知了。





仙女





从前有一位寡妇，她有两个女儿：大女儿的脾气和容貌都与母亲很像很像，别人只要一看见她，就等于看见她的母亲。她们两人都叫人讨厌，而且又很骄傲，别人简直不能和她们在一起生活。

小女儿待人忠厚，性格正直，跟她父亲一模一样，她是别人从来没有见过的最美丽的姑娘。

人总是爱跟意气相投的人相处，母亲当然溺爱她的大女儿，对于小女儿却很反感。她总是叫小女儿在厨房里做饭，又叫她不停地干活。

此外，这可怜的小女孩每天还要到半法里外去汲两次水，并且每次都把水罐汲得满满的。

有一天，她在泉边汲水，一个可怜的女人来向她讨水喝。

“好，我的好大娘，”这美丽的姑娘说了，立刻把水罐洗了洗，从那泉中最好的地方汲起水来递给她，还帮她托着水罐，让她喝起来更方便一点儿。

那女人喝了水后，对姑娘说：“你是这样美丽，这样善良，这样诚实，使我禁不住要送你一份礼物了。”那乡下女人原来是一位仙女的化身，她是来看这女孩到底有多么诚恳的。“我要送你一件礼物，”仙女接下去说，“就是你每说一句话，你的嘴里就会吐出一朵花儿，或是一块宝石。”

小女孩回到家中，她的母亲责备她回来得那么晚。

“妈妈，我回来晚了，请你饶了我。”

可怜的小女儿说这些话的时候，她的嘴里吐出两朵玫瑰花、两颗珍珠、两颗大金刚钻。

“咦，我看见什么了？”那母亲惊奇地说，“我想这是从你嘴里吐出来的珍珠和宝石吧，我的女儿？”这是她第一次叫她女儿。

那可怜的女孩老老实实地把事情的经过讲给她听，一面说，一面又吐出无数的宝石来。

“真的，”母亲说，“我应该叫大女儿也到那儿去。哦，芳琼，你看看你妹妹说话时吐出来的东西。你有了这样的礼物，可不就快活了吗？你也到泉边去汲水，有穷苦的女人向你讨水喝时，你只要老老实实给她喝就是了。”

“谁高兴到泉边去！”那粗鲁的大女儿说。

“我要你去，”母亲说，“立刻就去！”

她只好前去，可是嘴里却抱怨个不停。她拿的是家里最美的银瓶。她到泉边不久，就看见一位穿着华丽的贵妇从林子里出来，向她讨水喝。这就是在她妹妹面前出现过的那位仙女，可是她现在化作一位公主，来看看这姑娘到底坏到什么程度。

“你以为我到这里来是为打水给你喝的吗？”这骄傲愚蠢的人说，“我拿了一个银瓶来，专为打水给贵妇喝的吗？算了吧，你要喝就喝吧。”

“你一点儿礼貌也没有，”仙女说，但是没有生气，“好！既然你不诚恳，我要送你一件礼物，那就是你每说一句话，你的嘴里就吐出一条蛇或是一只癞蛤蟆来。”

她的母亲看见她，就向她喊道：“哦，我的女儿！”

“哦，我的妈妈！”这愚蠢的人回答，嘴里吐出两条大蛇和两只癞蛤蟆来。

“天啊，”母亲喊起来，“我看见的是什么呀？这全是你妹妹的缘故！我要她赔偿。”说着就去打小女儿。

那可怜的孩子逃到一个邻近的树林中。恰巧有一位王子打猎回来，遇见了她，看见她这样美丽，就问她为什么独自一个人在那儿，为什么这样哭。

“唉，先生，因为我母亲把我从家里赶出来了。”

王子看见她嘴里吐出四五颗珍珠和许多宝石，就请她告诉他，这些东西是从哪里来的。她把她的奇遇讲给他听。

王子爱上了她，而且他想，和别人结婚时，所有的东西都比不上她的礼物，于是他就带她到父亲的王宫里，和她结婚了。



可是她的姐姐却使人非常厌恶，连她亲生的母亲也把她撵了出去。那个坏女人跑了许多地方，没有一个人愿意收留她，她终于死在树林的角落里。





卷毛角吕盖





从前有一位王后，生了一个丑陋的儿子。他的丑陋，几乎使人们疑心他不是一个人。在他生下来那一天，来了一位仙女，一口咬定说会有人爱他的，说他将来长大时一定很聪明。她甚至还说，他得了她所送的礼物，还能够把他的聪明分给他最爱的人。

这些话使可怜的王后稍微得到些安慰，她因为生下这样可怕的一只猴子，实在很痛苦。仙女的话不错，这孩子能说话以后不久，就说了许多美丽动听的话。他聪明伶俐，一举一动使人喜爱。

我忘记说了，他生下时，头上生着一小撮突起的头发，像一个鸡冠，因此大家都称他为卷毛角吕盖——吕盖是他的姓。

过了七八年，邻国一位王后生了两个女儿。第一个落地的女儿比白昼还美丽。王后快乐万分，人们替她担心，极度的快乐会对她有害。这天，在卷毛角吕盖生日那天曾去过吕盖家的那位仙女来了，她使王后大为扫兴，她告诉王后，那第一个女儿长大时一定不聪明，她的愚笨将和她的美丽相等，这话使王后很不高兴。可是没过多少时间，她又感到非常痛苦，痛苦得比听了仙女的话还要厉害，因为她生下来的第二个女儿生得异常丑陋。

“你不必忧愁，王后，”仙女对她说，“你的女儿自会得到补偿，她将来会非常聪明，不会使人觉得她不美丽。”

“但愿如此，”王后回答，“可是大女儿那样的可爱，难道你不能赐给她一点儿聪明吗？”

“我不能给她聪明，王后。”仙女说，“不过说到美丽这一方面，倒还有点儿办法。因为我没有这个权力，实在不能满足你的要求。不过我要送她这样的能力：使她能把美丽给她所爱的人。”

两个公主慢慢长大，各人的天赋都在发展，大家总是谈着大女儿的美丽和小女儿的聪明。她们的缺点也随着年龄日益发展。妹妹一天一天地越长越丑，姐姐一天一天地越长越笨。姐姐跟人说话，不是没话回答，就是说些傻话。她笨到这个样子，如果你叫她拿四件瓷器放到炉架子上去，她总要打碎一半，喝一杯水也总要打翻半杯在身上。

虽然少女的美丽占了许多便宜，可是小妹妹总是超过她的姐姐。起初，人们总围着这个最美丽的姐姐，瞧着她，惊叹她的美丽。可是不久，他们就离开她到最聪明的妹妹那儿去，听妹妹讲许许多多的有趣的话。很快，姐姐身边一个人也没有了，大家都团团围住小妹妹。

年长的姐姐虽然很笨，看到这种情形，心中极愿意把她全部的美丽换得妹妹一半的聪明智慧。那王后虽然很贤惠，也免不了常常埋怨大女儿愚笨，因此使可怜的大公主万分忧愁。

有一天，她躲到树林里痛哭自己的不幸，忽然看见一个丑陋可厌的人走到她身旁来，服饰却很华丽。

这就是青年王子卷毛角吕盖。王子早就爱上她了，当他看见她的画像以后（那是全世界都看得到的），他就离开了他的国土，一心想去见见她，和她谈谈。他能单独和她这样巧地碰到，使他异常快乐。他恭恭敬敬，极有礼貌地走近她的身边，向她问好以后，他看出她很悲哀，就对她说：

“小姐，我真不懂，像你这样美丽的人，为什么会这样忧愁？我虽然可以夸口说见过千千万万的女子，可像你这样美丽的人，老实说是从来没见过的。”

“你在取笑我吧，先生。”公主回答。说到这里，她就说不下去了。

吕盖接着说：“美丽有极大的好处，它自然超过其他一切事物。一个人有了美丽，我不知道还有什么东西使她这样痛苦。”

公主说：“我宁愿像你一样丑陋却聪明，可不要像我这样美丽而愚蠢得不得了。”

“小姐，我自问不聪明，不过有聪明当然最好。这种天赋的礼物，我们就算有了许多，不过总觉得还是不够。”

“这个道理我不懂，”公主说，“可是我知道我很笨，这就是使我忧愁的缘故。”

“如果你的烦恼就是这一点，小姐，那么我可以很容易地解除你的烦恼。”

“那么你怎么办呢？”公主说。

“我有一种能力，小姐，”卷毛角吕盖说，“我可以把无限的聪明赠送给我最爱的人。小姐，像你就是这样的人。这完全取决于你自己！你只要肯嫁给我，就可以有许多聪明智慧。”

公主闭着口，不答一声。

“我觉得，”卷毛角吕盖说，“这个提议使你烦恼，不过我倒并不惊奇，你去仔细想一想，一年以后再回答我。”

那公主非常缺少聪明智慧，不过她又万分渴望得到聪明智慧。她以为这一年是过不完的，就答应了他的提议。她答应卷毛角吕盖，说在一年后这一天嫁给他。她说完这话，顿时觉得自己已经不像以前那样了。她觉得自己说话非常流利，口齿伶俐，态度从容。从那时起，她和卷毛角吕盖开始畅快地谈话，她谈话时态度大方，生动活泼，使卷毛角吕盖相信，他给她的聪明，比他自己保留的要多。

当她回宫时，全宫的人都很诧异，觉得她的变化实在太大了，因为她从前出言是很愚笨的，现在却变得非常聪明了。

全宫的人都很开心。唯有那位年幼的公主很不愉快，因为她的聪明本来是胜过姐姐的。如今她只有可憎的面貌，而没有其他本事胜过她姐姐了。

国王现在听年长的公主的话了，有时连国务会议也在她的房间里开。

这种转变传出去以后，邻国的王子们都竭力想得到她的爱情，几乎每个王子都向她求过婚。可是她觉得他们没有一个是很聪明的，所以她听了他们求婚的话，一个也不答应。

后来来了一位非常有权势、非常富有、非常俊美的王子，她不由自主地爱上了他。她的父亲看出了这种情形，就对她说，他完全听任她自由选择丈夫，选定以后宣布就是了。

人的智慧愈多，决断这样的事愈难。她谢过父亲之后，请他给她些日子去思索。

她偶然走到从前遇见卷毛角吕盖的树林中，默默思索着她所要办的事。她一边走，一边想，忽然听见一阵阵沉浊的声音从脚下发出来，好像有许多人在来来往往奔走，忙着做事。她仔细一听，听见一个人说：“把锅子给我。”另一个人说：“把炒锅拿给我。”还有一个说：“在火上加些柴。”

这时土地裂开来了，她看见她脚下有一个奇大无比的厨房，有许多男女厨师和各色仆役，当然是在预备大筵席。不一会儿，走出大约有二三十个烤肉师，他们走到林中的小路上，留在那儿，站在一张很长的桌子周围，手里拿着猪肉签子，尖帽子垂到耳朵边，有节奏地唱着嘹亮的歌声，开始快乐地工作。

公主看见这种情形，十分惊异，问他们为谁干活。

“小姐，”烤肉师中最漂亮的一个说，“为卷毛角吕盖干活。他明天就要举行婚礼了。”

那公主越发感到诧异，忽然她记起来，自从她答应嫁给卷毛角吕盖，到明天恰巧满十二个月了。她惊慌失措了。因为她答应他求婚时是个愚人，所以记不起来这件事，自从得了他给她的聪明智慧以后，她把以前的愚笨全部忘掉了。

她继续往前走了不到三十步路，卷毛角吕盖就来到她面前。他很快乐，装束得也很华美，完全像一个即将结婚的王子。

“你看，小姐，”他说，“我谨守我的话，我也相信你会遵守你的诺言。”

“对不起，”公主回答，“我对于这件事还没有做出决定，而且我还认为，我决不能这样做来使你满意。”

“你的话太使我惊奇了，小姐。”卷毛角吕盖说。

“我认为，”公主说，“而且确实认为，要是我和一个愚人，一个缺少智慧的人相处，一定会感到非常痛苦的。他可以对我说，‘公主是不食言的’，或者‘既然你答应过我，你一定要嫁给我’。可是现在和我对话的人，我当然知道他是讲理的。你要知道，当我从前是个愚人的时候，我还不能决定嫁不嫁给你。自从你给了我聪明智慧以后，使我比以前更难应对这个问题了，今天怎么能决定从前所不能决定的那个问题呢？要是你从前真的要娶我，那么你把我的愚笨去掉，就是犯了个大错误。现在我比从前看得格外清楚。”

卷毛角吕盖回答说：“假使一个没有聪明智慧的人得到过那种承诺，譬如像你刚才说的那样，他可以责备你不守约，可是小姐，为什么你说我不能采取同样的方式呢？我一生的欢乐都系在那儿啊！一个有聪明智慧的人，他的条件会不如一个没有聪明智慧的人，这难道是合理的吗？你能说出这样的话来吗？你有这么多聪明智慧，又这样诚恳地希望得到聪明智慧。现在让我们来谈事实吧。请你说一说，除了丑陋以外，我有什么使你不满意的？你是不是不满意我的出身、我的聪明、我的脾气、我的举止呢？”

“一点儿也没有不满意，”公主回答，“你刚才说的，我都十分佩服。”

“如果是这样，”卷毛角吕盖说，“那我就快乐了。你能使我变成世界上最可爱的人。”

“怎样才能变成功呢？”公主问道。

卷毛角吕盖说：“假使你十分爱我，而且希望这事成功，你就一定能办成。况且，小姐，你对这件事可以不必怀疑。要知道当初那位仙女，在我降生的时候赐给我一种权力，让我送给我所爱的人以聪明智慧，她也给了你一种权力，你可以送给你所爱的人以美丽，大概你也很愿意把美丽送给我吧。”



“要是这话是真的，”公主说，“我愿意，我全心全意地愿意，我要使你成为世界上最美丽的王子，我要竭尽全力把这礼物送给你。”

公主说了这话不久，便看见卷毛角吕盖顿时变成一个她从来没有见过的、世界上最美丽最可爱的人。

有些人说，这不是神力，只是爱情的结果。他们说那公主想起了他的恒心、他的谨慎、他灵魂上和智慧上的一切美质，就再看不见他身上的缺点和脸上的丑陋了。他的驼背，在她看来只不过像人们耸肩一样；她不觉得他瘸腿走路难看，在她看来，这正像侧着身子一样好看；别人还说他眼睛是斜的，可是在她看来，这很有光彩；而他的不定的眼光在她看来正是热情的象征。最后，他那个又大又红的鼻子，在她看来却是充满英雄气概。

不管他怎么样，只要得到她父王的同意，她就立刻答应嫁给他。

国王知道他的女儿看中了这位卷毛角吕盖，而且知道他是以聪明智慧出名的，就很快乐地答应他做女婿。

第二天，婚礼便举行了。这正是卷毛角吕盖从前所盼望的，而且这婚礼是完全照着他好久以前下的命令安排的。





蓝胡子





从前有个男人，他在城里和乡下有不少财产。他家道富有，有各种金银器皿，有套着绣花布罩的家具和镀金的四轮马车。不过这男人很不幸，长着一脸难看的蓝胡子，女人们一看到他，吓得转身就跑。

蓝胡子有个邻居，是个贵族妇人。她有两个花儿般美丽的女儿。蓝胡子想娶她的一个女儿做妻子，请求她嫁一个女儿给他。可是那两个女儿看不上他，互相推诿，不肯嫁给蓝胡子做妻子。她们又很忌讳，蓝胡子已经娶过几次妻子，但是从来没有人知道那些女人的下落。

蓝胡子为了讨好她们，特地邀请她们母女到他的乡间别墅里住一个星期。他还请了她女儿的一些好友和邻近的几个年轻妇人给她们做伴。

她们在别墅里除了娱乐性的舞会、打猎、钓鱼和豪华的夜宴之外，没有看到什么。大家通宵不睡，只是聚在一起谈谈说说，寻欢作乐。蓝胡子的这次邀请非常成功。贵族妇人那个小女儿动了心，开始改变想法，认为别墅主人的蓝色胡子并不像以前那样讨厌了，他本人也是一个出色的上等人。



他们回到城里以后，不久就决定结婚了。过了一个月，蓝胡子告诉年轻的妻子：“我有重要事情要下乡一次，至少六个星期。在我出门期间，请你自行安排，要散散心，也可邀请一些亲朋好友。要是高兴的话，可以带他们去乡下走走，做些菜肴招待他们。”

说完之后，蓝胡子又交代妻子：“这是两个大库房的钥匙，库房里面放着我最喜欢的家具；这是开金银食器房间的钥匙，这些食器平常不使用；这是保险柜上的钥匙，里面存放着金银货币；这是珠宝箱的钥匙；这是一把开家里所有房间的万能钥匙；这把小钥匙是开底层大走廊靠边一个小房间的钥匙。那些房间你可以开门进去。不过靠边那个小房间你不许进去。要是进去了，可别怪我生气，会使你受不了。”

年轻的妻子答应一定照他的话办。于是他拥抱过妻子后，乘上漂亮的四轮马车走了。

那些邻居和好朋友早已等待得不耐烦了，希望新主妇邀请她们去她家里参观华丽的家具。以前有她丈夫在家，她们因为忌惮蓝胡子，都不敢进她家门。她们参观了她家的寝室、大大小小的房间和库房。那些房间布置得非常精致，一处胜过一处。



后来她们又上楼去，走进两个房间。那里摆设着最豪华的家具，墙上挂着墙帷，床铺、睡椅、大橱子、柜子、桌子、镜子，一应俱全，真是琳琅满目，美不胜收。特别是那些镜子，在作者那个时代镜子是珍贵的高档用品，可以从头照到脚。镜框有的是用银子打成的，也有包金的，看得人眼花缭乱，都是她们从来没见过的、最豪华的珍品。

女朋友们看了都赞不绝口，羡慕新婚主妇的幸福生活。不过年轻的妻子一心想看遍家里全部东西，想去打开底层那个小房间。因为她急于想看小房间里的东西，竟不顾独自离开客人有失礼貌，自个儿从后面的小扶梯走下去，走得那么匆忙，仿佛怕人扭断她的脖子似的。

她走到小房间门口，不由停了下来，犹豫一阵，想到丈夫嘱咐的话，考虑要是不遵守的话，是否会有灾祸临头。可是她想开门进去看看，那诱惑力实在太大了，她克制不住，终于拿出小钥匙来，哆哆嗦嗦地开了门。

起初，她什么也没看清楚，因为里面窗子关着。过了一会儿，她才看出地板上的斑斑血迹，靠墙一字儿躺着几个女人的尸体（那些女人都是蓝胡子从前娶来后杀死的）。

她吓得要死，慌忙从锁孔里拔出钥匙，一不小心，钥匙从手里落在地上。

等到定下神来，她急忙拾起钥匙，锁上了门，飞快跑上楼去，到卧室休息。因为她害怕极了，没法定下心来。她发觉那个小钥匙上沾了血，想把血迹擦去，擦了两三回，血迹总是擦不掉。她用水洗钥匙，甚至还用肥皂和沙子擦洗，总是洗不干净，血迹依然留在上面。因为那钥匙上施过魔法，她没法擦去血迹。钥匙上一边的血擦去了，另一边又出现血迹。

那天晚上，蓝胡子回来了。他告诉她，他在路上听到信息，他要办的事已经顺利完成。他的妻子强作镇静，说他能很快回家，她很高兴。

第二天早晨，他向妻子要回那些钥匙，她把钥匙一一交还给他。她交钥匙的那只手老是哆嗦，因此他一下子就猜出了发生什么事。

“怎么？”他问道，“小房间的钥匙怎么不在一起？”

“准是忘在桌子上了。”她说。

“马上给我拿来。”蓝胡子说。

年轻的妻子磨磨蹭蹭，好大一会儿才把钥匙取来给他。蓝胡子仔细瞧着钥匙，问妻子道：

“钥匙上怎么会有血迹的？”

“我不知道。”可怜的女人吓得脸色苍白，大声嚷道。

“你不知道！”蓝胡子说，“我可知道。你是进了那个小房间吧？也好，太太，那你就进去吧，在你看到的那些夫人中间找一个适当位置。”

年轻的妻子听了这话，浑身发抖地跪到丈夫脚跟前，求他饶命，并且发誓以后一定悔改，绝不敢再违抗他的命令。看到她那种楚楚可怜和苦苦哀求的样子，即使铁石心肠也会软化的，可是蓝胡子的心肠比铁石还硬，居然毫不动心。他坚持说：

“太太，你非死不可，必须马上就死。”

“既然我非死不可，那就请你给我留些时间，让我向上帝忏悔。”年轻的妻子泪如雨下，苦苦哀求。

“好吧，那我给你五分钟时间，不许超过一秒钟。”蓝胡子斩钉截铁地说。

年轻的妻子上楼找她的姐姐说：

“安娜（这是她姐姐的名字），我求你到屋顶上去，瞧瞧咱们的两个哥哥来了没有。他们曾跟我约定，今天要来。你瞧到他们，立即发出暗号，催他们再快一点儿。”

安娜爬到屋顶上去。可怜那即将被害的妻子不断对姐姐叫嚷：

“安娜，看到有人来了吗？”

她姐姐回道：

“我只看到外面亮堂堂的阳光、绿油油的青草，别的什么也没有看到。”

这时蓝胡子手执钢刀，厉声对妻子说：

“赶快下来。不然我就上来啦。”

“请你等一会儿。”年轻的妻子回答后，急忙低声对姐姐说，“安娜，安娜姐姐，看到有人来吗？”

“我只看到外面亮堂堂的阳光、绿油油的青草，别的什么也没有看到。”

“赶快下来。不然我就上来啦。”蓝胡子又在号叫了。

“就来，就来。”

年轻的妻子答应过后，又朝姐姐喊道：

“安娜，安娜姐姐，看到有人来吗？”

“看到了。我看到大路上尘土滚滚，向咱们这儿扑来。”

“是哥哥们来了吗？”

“哎哟，不对。”安娜姐姐回道，“是一群羊！”

“你下来不下来？”蓝胡子吆喝道。

“再等一会儿。”

年轻的妻子回答后，又喊道：

“安娜，安娜姐姐，看到有人来吗？”

“看到啦！有两位骑士来了。不过他们离咱们这儿还远着呢！感谢老天爷！”她高兴地嚷了起来，“那是我们的两个哥哥。我必须想法子发出求救信号，催他们快点儿来。”

蓝胡子的号叫声更大了，响得整个房子都在抖动。不幸的妻子吓得面无人色，走下楼来，扑到丈夫脚跟前，头发披到肩上，淌着眼泪。

“你这样一点儿用也没有，你非死不可。”蓝胡子说着，一只手揪住她的头发，另一只手举起切菜刀要砍她的头。可怜的女人转过身子，用临死前的眼睛望着他，希望争取时间让他镇静下来。

“不行，不行。你只好靠上帝来救你了。”蓝胡子举起手来，正要把刀砍下去。

说时迟，那时快，忽然听到外面有人疯狂地敲门。蓝胡子一呆，猛然放下手来。大门一开，闯进两位骑士。他们拔出剑来，径直向蓝胡子刺去。蓝胡子认识这两位骑士，他们是他妻子的哥哥，一位是龙骑兵，一位是火枪手。他赶紧逃命，可是两位哥哥紧追不放，蓝胡子逃到门口脚跟没有站稳，两把剑已刺进他的身体，把他刺死在地。可怜的妻子差不多也像她的丈夫一样死了一般，连站起来欢迎哥哥们的力气也没有了。

蓝胡子没有子女，因此他的全部家产由他妻子继承下来。她把一部分财产分给安娜姐姐，让姐姐和一个长期同她相爱的青年贵族做结婚费用；另一部分赠送给她的两个哥哥做购买队长职位之用；剩余一部分自己就用来和一个正直的男人结婚。有了那个男人，她才能把她跟蓝胡子一起生活的那段不幸经历逐渐淡忘。

Little Red Riding Hood





Once upon a time there was a little village girl，the prettiest that had ever been seen．Her mother doted on her．Her grandmother was even fonder，and made her a little red hood，which became her so well that everywhere she went by the name of Little Red Riding Hood．

One day her mother，who had just made and baked some cakes，said to her：

“Go and see how your grandmother is，for I have been told that she is ill．Take her a cake and this little pot of butter．”

Little Red Riding Hood set off at once for the house of her grandmother，who lived in another village．

On her way through a wood she met old Father Wolf．He would have very much liked to eat her，but dared not do so on account of some woodcutters who were in the forest．He asked her where she was going．The poor child，not knowing that it was dangerous to stop and listen to a wolf，said：



“I am going to see my grandmother，and am taking her a cake and a pot of butter which my mother has sent to her．”

“Does she live far away？” asked the Wolf．

“Oh yes，” replied Little Red Riding Hood；“it is yonder by the mill which you can see right below there，and it is the first house in the village．”

“Well now，” said the Wolf，“I think I shall go and see her too．I will go by this path，and you by that path，and we will see who gets there first．”

The Wolf set off running with all his might by the shorter road，and the little girl continued on her way by the longer road．As she went she amused herself by gathering nuts，running after the butterflies，and making nosegays of the wild flowers which she found．

The Wolf was not long in reaching the grandmother's house．He knocked．Toc Toc．

“Who is there？”

“It is your little granddaughter，Red Riding Hood，” said the Wolf，disguising his voice，“and I bring you a cake and a little pot of butter as a present from my mother．”

The worthy grandmother was in bed，not being very well，and cried out to him：

“Pull out the peg and the latch will fall．”

The Wolf drew out the peg and the door flew open．Then he sprang upon the poor old lady and ate her up in less than no time，for he had been more than three days without food．After that he shut the door，lay down in the grandmother's bed，and waited for Little Red Riding Hood．

Presently she came and knocked．Toc Toc．

“Who is there？”

Now Little Red Riding Hood on hearing the Wolf's gruff voice was at first frightened，but thinking that her grandmother had a bad cold，she replied：

“It is your little granddaughter，Red Riding Hood，and I bring you a cake and a little pot of butter from my mother．”

Softening his voice，the Wolf called out to her：

“Pull out the peg and the latch will fall．”

Little Red Riding Hood drew out the peg and the door flew open．

When he saw her enter，the Wolf hid himself in the bed beneath the counterpane．

“Put the cake and the little pot of butter on the bin，” he said，“and come up on the bed with me．”

Little Red Riding Hood took off her clothes，but when she climbed up on the bed she was astonished to see how her grandmother looked in her nightgown．

“Grandmother dear！” she exclaimed，“what big arms you have！”

“The better to embrace you，my child！”

“Grandmother dear，what big legs you have！”

“The better to run with，my child！”

“Grandmother dear，what big ears you have！”

“The better to hear with，my child！”

“Grandmother dear，what big eyes you have！”

“The better to see with，my child！”

“Grandmother dear，what big teeth you have！”

“The better to eat you with！”

With these words the wicked Wolf leaped upon Little Red Riding Hood and gobbled her up．





The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood





Once upon a time there lived a king and queen who were grieved，more grieved than words can tell，because they had no children．They tried the waters of every country，made vows and pilgrimages，and did everything that could be done，but without result．

At last，however，the queen found that her wishes were fulfilled，and in due course she gave birth to a daughter．A grand christening was held，and all the fairies that could be found in the realm（they numbered seven in all）were invited to be godmothers to the little princess．This was done so that by means of the gifts which each in turn would bestow upon her（in accordance with the fairy custom of those days）the princess might be endowed with every imaginable perfection．

When the christening ceremony was over，all the company returned to the king's palace，where a great banquet was held in honor of the fairies．Places were laid for them in magnificent style，and before each was placed a solid gold casket containing a spoon，fork，and knife of fine gold，set with diamonds and rubies．But just as all were sitting down to table an aged fairy was seen to enter，whom no one had thought to invite—the reason being that for more than fifty years she had never quitted the tower in which she lived，and people had supposed her to be dead or bewitched．

By the king's orders a place was laid for her，but it was impossible to give her a golden casket like the others，for only seven had been made for the seven fairies．The old creature believed that she was intentionally slighted，and muttered threats between her teeth．She was overheard by one of the young fairies，who was seated nearby．The latter，guessing that some mischievous gift might be bestowed upon the little princess，hid behind the tapestry as soon as the company left the table．Her intention was to be the last to speak，and so to have the power of counteracting，as far as possible，any evil which the old fairy might do．

Presently the fairies began to bestow their gifts upon the princess．The youngest ordained that she should be the most beautiful person in the world；the next，that she should have the temper of an angel；the third，that she should do everything with wonderful grace；the fourth，that she should dance to perfection；the fifth，that she should sing like a nightingale；and the sixth，that she should play every kind of music with the utmost skill．

It was now the turn of the aged fairy．Shaking her head，in token of spite rather than of infirmity，she declared that the princess should prick her hand with a spindle，and die of it．

A shudder ran through the company at this terrible gift．All eyes were filled with tears．But at this moment the young fairy stepped forth from behind the tapestry．

“Take comfort，your Majesties，” she cried in a loud voice．“Your daughter shall not die．My power，it is true，is not enough to undo all that my aged kinswoman has decreed： the princess will indeed prick her hand with a spindle．But instead of dying she shall merely fall into a profound slumber that will last a hundred years．At the end of that time a king's son shall come to awaken her．”

The king，in an attempt to avert the unhappy doom pro-nounced by the old fairy，at once published an edict forbidding all persons，under pain of death，to use a spinning wheel or keep a spindle in the house．

At the end of fifteen or sixteen years the king and queen happened one day to be away，on pleasure bent．The princess was running about the castle，and going upstairs from room to room she came at length to a garret at the top of a tower，where an old serving woman sat alone with her distaff，spinning．This good woman had never heard speak of the king's proclamation forbidding the use of spinning wheels．



“What are you doing，my good woman？” asked the princess．

“I am spinning，my pretty child，” replied the dame，not knowing who she was．

“Oh，what fun！” rejoined the princess．“How do you do it？Let me try and see if I can do it equally well．”

Partly because she was too hasty，partly because she was a little heedless，but also because the fairy decree had ordained it，no sooner had she seized the spindle than she pricked her hand and fell down in a swoon．

In great alarm the good dame cried out for help．People came running from every quarter to the princess．They threw water on her face，chafed her with their hands，and rubbed her temples with the royal essence of Hungary．But nothing would restore her．

Then the king，who had been brought upstairs by the commotion，remembered the fairy prophecy．Feeling certain that what had happened was inevitable，since the fairies had decreed it，he gave orders that the princess should be placed in the finest apartment in the palace，upon a bed embroidered in gold and silver．

You would have thought her an angel，so fair was she to behold．The trance had not taken away the lovely color of her complexion．Her cheeks were delicately flushed，her lips like coral．Her eyes，indeed，were closed，but her gentle breathing could be heard，and it was therefore plain that she was not dead．The king commanded that she should be left to sleep in peace until the hour of her awakening should come．

When the accident happened to the princess，the good fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a hundred years was in the kingdom of Mataquin，twelve thousand leagues away．She was instantly warned of it，however，by a little dwarf who had a pair of seven-league boots，which are boots that enable one to cover seven leagues at a single step．

The fairy set off at once，and within an hour her chariot of fire，drawn by dragons，was seen approaching．The king handed her down from her chariot，and she approved of all that he had done．But being gifted with great powers of foresight，she bethought herself that when the princess came to be awakened，she would be much distressed to find herself all alone in the old castle．And this is what she did．

She touched with her wand everybody（except the king and queen）who was in the castle—governesses，maids of honor，ladies-in-waiting，gentlemen，officers，stewards，cooks，scullions，errand boys，guards，porters，pages，footmen．She touched likewise all the horses in the stables，with their grooms，the big mastiffs in the courtyard，and little Puff，the pet dog of the princess，who was lying on the bed beside his mistress．The moment she had touched them they all fell asleep，to awaken only at the same moment as their mistress．Thus they would always be ready with their service whenever she should require it．The very spits before the fire，loaded with partridges and pheasants，subsided into slumber，and the fire as well．All was done in a moment，for the fairies do not take long over their work．

Then the king and queen kissed their dear child，without waking her，and left the castle．Proclamations were issued，forbidding any approach to it，but these warnings were not needed，for within a quarter of an hour there grew up all round the park so vast a quantity of trees big and small，with interlacing brambles and thorns，that neither man nor beast could penetrate them．The tops alone of the castle towers could be seen，and these only from a distance．Thus did the fairy's magic contrive that the princess，during all the time of her slumber，should have naught whatever to fear from prying eyes．

At the end of a hundred years the throne had passed to another family from that of the sleeping princess．One day the king's son chanced to go a-hunting that way，and seeing in the distance some towers in the midst of a large and dense forest，he asked what they were．His attendants told him in reply the various stories which they had heard．Some said there was an old castle haunted by ghosts，others that all the witches of the neighborhood held their revels there．The favorite tale was that in the castle lived an ogre，who carried thither all the children whom he could catch．There he devoured them at his leisure，and since he was the only person who could force a passage through the wood nobody had been able to pursue him．



While the prince was wondering what to believe，an old peasant took up the tale．

“Your Highness，” said he，“more than fifty years ago I heard my father say that in this castle lies a princess，the most beautiful that has ever been seen．It is her doom to sleep there for a hundred years，and then to be awakened by a king's son，for whose coming she waits．”

This story fired the young prince．He jumped immediately to the conclusion that it was for him to see so gay an adventure through，and impelled alike by the wish for love and glory，he resolved to set about it on the spot．

Hardly had he taken a step towards the wood when the tall trees，the brambles and the thorns，separated of themselves and made a path for him．He turned in the direction of the castle，and espied it at the end of a long avenue．This avenue he entered，and was surprised to notice that the trees closed up again as soon as he had passed，so that none of his retinue were able to follow him．A young and gallant prince is always brave，however；so he continued on his way，and presently reached a large forecourt．The sight that now met his gaze was enough to fill him with an icy fear．The silence of the place was dreadful，and death seemed all about him．The recumbent figures of men and animals had all the appearance of being lifeless，until he perceived by the pimply noses and ruddy faces of the porters that they merely slept．It was plain，too，from their glasses，in which were still some dregs of wine，that they had fallen asleep while drinking．



The prince made his way into a great courtyard，paved with marble，and mounting the staircase entered the guardroom．Here the guards were lined up on either side in two ranks，their muskets on their shoulders，snoring their hardest．Through several apartments crowded with ladies and gentlemen in waiting，some seated，some standing，but all asleep，he pushed on，and so came at last to a chamber which was decked all over with gold．There he encountered the most beautiful sight he had ever seen．Reclining upon a bed，the curtains of which on every side were drawn back，was a princess of seemingly some fifteen or sixteen summers，whose radiant beauty had an almost unearthly luster．Trembling in his admiration he drew near and went on his knees beside her．

At the same moment，the hour of disenchantment having come，the princess awoke，and bestowed upon him a look more tender than a first glance might seem to warrant．

“Is it you，dear prince？” she said．“You have been long in coming！”

Charmed by these words，and especially by the manner in which they were said，the prince scarcely knew how to express his delight and gratification．He declared that he loved her better than he loved himself．His words were faltering，but they pleased the more for that．The less there is of eloquence，the more there is of love．Her embarrassment was less than his，and that is not to be wondered at，since she had had time to think of what she would say to him．It seems（although the story says nothing about it）that the good fairy had beguiled her long slumber with pleasant dreams．To be brief，after four hours of talking they had not succeeded in uttering one half of the things they had to say to each other．

Now the whole palace had awakened with the princess．Everyone went about his business，and since they were not all in love they presently began to feel mortally hungry．The lady-in-waiting，who was suffering like the rest，at length lost patience，and in a loud voice called out to the princess that supper was served．

The princess was already fully dressed，and in most magnificent style．As he helped her to rise，the prince refrained from telling her that her clothes，with the straight collar which she wore，were like those to which his grandmother had been accustomed．And in truth，they in no way detracted from her beauty．

They passed into an apartment hung with mirrors，and were there served with supper by the stewards of the household，while the fiddles and oboes played some old music and played it remarkably well，considering they had not played at all for just upon a hundred years．A little later，when supper was over，the chaplain married them in the castle chapel，and in due course，attended by the courtiers in waiting，they retired to rest．

They slept but little，however．The princess，indeed，had not much need of sleep，and as soon as morning came the prince took his leave of her．He returned to the city，and told his father，who was awaiting him with some anxiety，that he had lost himself while hunting in the forest，but had obtained some black bread and cheese from a charcoal burner，in whose hovel he had passed the night．His royal father，being of an easygoing nature，believed the tale，but his mother was not so easily hoodwinked．She noticed that he now went hunting every day，and that he always had an excuse handy when he had slept two or three nights from home．She felt certain，therefore，that he had some love affair．

Two whole years passed since the marriage of the prince and princess，and during that time they had two children．The first，a daughter，was called “Dawn，” while the second，a boy，was named “Day，” because he seemed even more beautiful than his sister．

Many a time the queen told her son that he ought to settle down in life．She tried in this way to make him confide in her，but he did not dare to trust her with his secret．Despite the affection which he bore her，he was afraid of his mother，for she came of a race of ogres，and the king had only married her for her wealth．It was whispered at the court that she had ogrish instincts，and that when little children were near her she had the greatest difficulty in the world to keep herself from pouncing on them．No wonder the prince was reluctant to say a word．

But at the end of two years the king died，and the prince found himself on the throne．He then made public announcement of his marriage，and went in state to fetch his royal consort from her castle．With her two children beside her she made a triumphal entry into the capital of her husband's realm．

Some time afterwards the king declared war on his neighbor，the Emperor Cantalabutte．He appointed the queen mother as regent in his absence，and entrusted his wife and children to her care．He expected to be away at the war for the whole of the summer，and as soon as he was gone the queen mother sent her daughter-in-law and the two children to a country mansion in the forest．This she did that she might be able the more easily to gratify her horrible longings．A few days later she went there and in the evening summoned the chief steward．

“For my dinner tomorrow，” she told him，“I will eat little Dawn．”

“Oh，Madam！” exclaimed the steward．

“That is my will，” said the queen；and she spoke in the tones of an ogre who longs for raw meat．“You will serve her with piquant sauce，” she added．

The poor man，seeing plainly that it was useless to trifle with an ogress，took his big knife and went up to little Dawn's chamber．She was at that time four years old，and when she came running with a smile to greet him，flinging her arms round his neck and coaxing him to give her some sweets，he burst into tears，and let the knife fall from his hand．

Presently he went down to the yard behind the house，and slaughtered a young lamb．For this he made so delicious a sauce that his mistress declared she had never eaten anything so good．

At the same time the steward carried little Dawn to his wife，and bade the latter hide her in the quarters which they had below the yard．

Eight days later the wicked queen summoned her steward again．

“For my supper，” she announced，“I will eat little Day．”

The steward made no answer，being determined to trick her as he had done previously．He went in search of little Day，whom he found with a tiny foil in his hand，making brave passes—though he was but three years old—at a big monkey．He carried him off to his wife，who stowed him away in hiding with little Dawn．To the ogress the steward served up，in place of Day，a young kid so tender that she found it surpassingly delicious．

So far，so good．But there came an evening when this evil queen again addressed the steward．

“I have a mind，” she said，“to eat the queen with the same sauce as you served with her children．”

This time the poor steward despaired of being able to practice another deception．The young queen was twenty years old，without counting the hundred years she had been asleep．Her skin，though white and beautiful，had become a little tough，and what animal could he possibly find that would correspond to her？He made up his mind that if he would save his own life he must kill the queen，and went upstairs to her apartment determined to do the deed once and for all．Goading himself into a rage he drew his knife and entered the young queen's chamber，but a reluctance to give her no moment of grace made him repeat respectfully the command which he had received from the queen mother．

“Do it！do it！” she cried，baring her neck to him；“carry out the order you have been given！Then once more I shall see my children，my poor children that I loved so much！” Nothing had been said to her when the children were stolen away，and she believed them to be dead．

The poor steward was overcome by compassion．“No，no，Madam，” he declared．“You shall not die，but you shall certainly see your children again．That will be in my quarters，where I have hidden them．I shall make the queen eat a young hind in place of you，and thus trick her once more．”

Without more ado he led her to his quarters，and leaving her there to embrace and weep over her children，proceeded to cook a hind with such art that the queen mother ate it for her supper with as much appetite as if it had indeed been the young queen．

The queen mother felt well satisfied with her cruel deeds，and planned to tell the king，on his return，that savage wolves had devoured his consort and his children．

It was her habit，however，to prowl often about the courts and alleys of the mansion，in the hope of scenting raw meat，and one evening she heard the little boy Day crying in a basement cellar．The child was weeping because his mother had threatened to whip him for some naughtiness，and she heard at the same time the voice of Dawn begging forgiveness for her brother．

The ogress recognized the voices of the queen and her children，and was enraged to find she had been tricked．The next morning，in tones so affrighting that all trembled，she ordered a huge vat to be brought into the middle of the courtyard．This she filled with vipers and toads，with snakes and serpents of every kind，intending to cast into it the queen and her children，and the steward with his wife and serving girl．By her command these were brought forward，with their hands tied behind their backs．

There they were，and her minions were making ready to cast them into the vat，when into the courtyard rode the king！Nobody had expected him so soon，but he had traveled posthaste．Filled with amazement，he demanded to know what this horrible spectacle meant．None dared tell him，and at that moment the ogress，enraged at what confronted her，threw herself head foremost into the vat，and was devoured on the instant by the hideous creatures she had placed in it．

The king could not but be sorry，for after all she was his mother；but it was not long before he found ample consolation in his beautiful wife and children．





Cinderella





Once upon a time there was a worthy man who married for his second wife the haughtiest，proudest woman that had ever been seen．She had two daughters，who possessed their mother's temper and resembled her in everything．Her husband，on the other hand，had a young daughter，who was of an exceptionally sweet and gentle nature．She got this from her mother，who had been the nicest person in the world．

The wedding was no sooner over than the stepmother began to display her bad temper．She could not endure the excellent qualities of this young girl，for they made her own daughters appear more hateful than ever．She thrust upon her all the meanest tasks about the house．It was she who had to clean the plates and the stairs，and sweep out the rooms of the mistress of the house and her daughters．She slept on a wretched mattress in a garret at the top of the house，while the sisters had rooms with parquet flooring，and beds of the most fashionable style，with mirrors in which they could see themselves from top to toe．



The poor girl endured everything patiently，not daring to complain to her father．The latter would have scolded her，because he was entirely ruled by his wife．

When she had finished her work she used to sit amongst the cinders in the corner of the chimney，and it was from this habit that she came to be commonly known as Cinder-slut．The younger of the two sisters，who was not quite so spiteful as the elder，called her Cinderella．But her wretched clothes did not prevent Cinderella from being a hundred times more beautiful than her sisters，for all their resplendent garments．

It happened that the king's son gave a ball，and he invited all persons of high degree．The two young ladies were invited amongst others，for they cut a considerable figure in the country．Not a little pleased were they，and the question of what clothes and what mode of dressing the hair would become them best took up all their time．And all this meant fresh trouble for Cinderella，for it was she who went over her sisters' linen and ironed their ruffles．They could talk of nothing else but the fashions in clothes．

“For my part，” said the elder，“I shall wear my dress of red velvet，with the Honiton lace．”

“I have only my everyday petticoat，” said the younger，“but to make up for it I shall wear my cloak with the golden flowers and my necklace of diamonds，which are not so bad．”

They sent for a good hairdresser to arrange their double-frilled caps，and bought patches at the best shop．They summoned Cinderella and asked her advice，for she had good taste．Cinderella gave them the best possible suggestions，and even offered to dress their hair，to which they gladly agreed．

While she was thus occupied they said：

“Cinderella，would you not like to go to the ball？”

“Ah，but you fine young ladies are laughing at me．It would be no place for me．”

“That is very true，people would laugh to see a cinder-slut in the ballroom．”

Anyone else but Cinderella would have done their hair amiss，but she was good-natured，and she finished them off to perfection．They were so excited in their glee that for nearly two days they ate nothing．They broke more than a dozen laces through drawing their stays tight in order to make their waists more slender，and they were perpetually in front of a mirror．

At last the happy day arrived．Away they went，Cinderella watching them as long as she could keep them in sight．When she could no longer see them she began to cry．Her godmother found her in tears，and asked what was troubling her．

“I should like—I should like—” She was crying so bitterly that she could not finish the sentence．

Said her godmother，who was a fairy：

“You would like to go to the ball，would you not？”

“Ah，yes，” said Cinderella，sighing．

“Well，well，” said her godmother，“promise to be a good girl and I will arrange for you to go．” She took Cinderella into her room and said： “Go into the garden and bring me a pumpkin．”

Cinderella went at once and gathered the finest that she could find．This she brought to her godmother，wondering how a pumpkin could help in taking her to the ball．

Her godmother scooped it out，and when only the rind was left，struck it with her wand．Instantly the pumpkin was changed into a beautiful coach，gilded all over．

Then she went and looked in the mousetrap，where she found six mice all alive．She told Cinderella to lift the door of the mouse-trap a little，and as each mouse came out she gave it a tap with her wand，whereupon it was transformed into a fine horse．So that here was a fine team of six dappled mouse-grey horses．

But she was puzzled to know how to provide a coachman．

“I will go and see，” said Cinderella，“if there is not a rat in the rattrap．We could make a coachman of him．”

“Quite right，” said her godmother，“go and see．”

Cinderella brought in the rattrap，which contained three big rats．The fairy chose one specially on account of his elegant whiskers．As soon as she had touched him he turned into a fat coachman with the finest moustachios that ever were seen．



“Now go into the garden and bring me the six lizards which you will find behind the water-butt．”

No sooner had they been brought than the godmother turned them into six lackeys，who at once climbed up behind the coach in their braided liveries，and hung on there as if they had never done anything else all their lives．

Then said the fairy godmother：

“Well，there you have the means of going to the ball．Are you satisfied？”

“Oh，yes，but am I to go like this in my ugly clothes？”

Her godmother merely touched her with her wand，and on the instant her clothes were changed into garments of gold and silver cloth，bedecked with jewels．After that her godmother gave her a pair of glass slippers，the prettiest in the world．

Thus altered，she entered the coach．Her godmother bade her not to stay beyond midnight whatever happened，warning her that if she remained at the ball a moment longer，her coach would again become a pumpkin，her horses mice，and her lackeys lizards，while her old clothes would reappear upon her once more．

She promised her godmother that she would not fail to leave the ball before midnight，and away she went，beside herself with delight．

The king's son，when he was told of the arrival of a great princess whom nobody knew，went forth to receive her．He handed her down from the coach，and led her into the hall where the company was assembled．

At once there fell a great silence．The dancers stopped，the violins played no more，so rapt was the attention which everybody bestowed upon the superb beauty of the unknown guest．Everywhere could be heard in confused whispers：

“Oh，how beautiful she is！”

The king，old man as he was，could not take his eyes off her，and whispered to the queen that it was many a long day since he had seen anyone so beautiful and charming．

All the ladies were eager to scrutinise her clothes and the dressing of her hair，being determined to copy them on the morrow，provided they could find materials so fine，and tailors so clever．

The king's son placed her in the seat of honor，and at once begged the privilege of being her partner in a dance．Such was the grace with which she danced that the admiration of all was increased．

A magnificent supper was served，but the young prince could eat nothing，so taken up was he with watching her．She went and sat beside her sisters，and bestowed numberless attentions upon them．She made them share with her the oranges and lemons which the king had given her—greatly to their astonishment，for they did not recognise her．

While they were talking，Cinderella heard the clock strike a quarter to twelve．She at once made a profound curtsey to the company，and departed as quickly as she could．

As soon as she was home again she sought out her godmother，and having thanked her，declared that she wished to go upon the morrow once more to the ball，because the king's son had invited her．While she was busy telling her godmother all that had happened at the ball，her two sisters knocked at the door．Cinderella let them in．

“What a long time you have been in coming！” she declared，rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had only just awakened．In real truth she had not for a moment wished to sleep since they had left．

“If you had been at the ball，” said one of the sisters，“you would not be feeling weary．There came a most beautiful princess，the most beautiful that has ever been seen，and she bestowed numberless attentions upon us，and gave us her oranges and lemons．”

Cinderella was overjoyed．She asked them the name of the princess，but they replied that no one knew it，and that the king's son was so distressed that he would give anything in the world to know who she was．

Cinderella smiled，and said she must have been beautiful indeed．“Oh，how lucky you are．Could I not manage to see her？Oh，please，Javotte，lend me the yellow dress which you wear every day．”

“Indeed！” said Javotte，“that is a fine idea．Lend my dress to a grubby cinder-slut like you—you must think me mad！”

Cinderella had expected this refusal．She was in no way upset，for she would have been very greatly embarrassed had her sister been willing to lend the dress．

The next day the two sisters went to the ball，and so did Cinderella，even more splendidly attired than the first time．

The king's son was always at her elbow，and paid her endless compliments．

The young girl enjoyed herself so much that she forgot her godmother's bidding completely，and when the first stroke of midnight fell upon her ears，she thought it was no more than eleven o'clock．She rose and fled as nimbly as a fawn．The prince followed her，but could not catch her．She let fall one of her glass slippers，however，and this the prince picked up with tender care．

When Cinderella reached home she was out of breath，without coach，without lackeys，and in her shabby clothes．Nothing remained of all her splendid clothes save one of the little slippers，the fellow to the one which she had let fall．

Inquiries were made of the palace doorkeepers as to whether they had seen a princess go out，but they declared they had seen no one leave except a young girl，very ill-clad，who looked more like a peasant than a young lady．

When her two sisters returned from the ball，Cinderella asked them if they had again enjoyed themselves，and if the beautiful lady had been there．They told her that she was present，but had fled away when midnight sounded，and in such haste that she had let fall one of her little glass slippers，the prettiest thing in the world．They added that the king's son，who picked it up，had done nothing but gaze at it for the rest of the ball，from which it was plain that he was deeply in love with its beautiful owner．

They spoke the truth．A few days later，the king's son caused a proclamation to be made by trumpeters，that he would take for wife the owner of the foot which the slipper would fit．

They tried it first on the princesses，then on the duchesses and the whole of the Court，but in vain．Presently they brought it to the home of the two sisters，who did all they could to squeeze a foot into the slipper．This，however，they could not manage．

Cinderella was looking on and recognised her slipper：

“Let me see，” she cried，laughingly，“if it will not fit me．”

Her sisters burst out laughing，and began to gibe at her，but the equerry who was trying on the slipper looked closely at Cinderella．Observing that she was very beautiful he declared that the claim was quite a fair one，and that his orders were to try the slipper on every maiden．He bade Cinderella sit down，and on putting the slipper to her little foot he perceived that the latter slid in without trouble，and was moulded to its shape like wax．



Great was the astonishment of the two sisters at this，and greater still when Cinderella drew from her pocket the other little slipper．This she likewise drew on．

At that very moment her godmother appeared on the scene．She gave a tap with her wand to Cinderella's clothes，and transformed them into a dress even more magnificent than her previous ones．

The two sisters recognised her for the beautiful person whom they had seen at the ball，and threw themselves at her feet，begging her pardon for all the ill-treatment she had suffered at their hands．

Cinderella raised them，and declaring as she embraced them that she pardoned them with all her heart，bade them to love her well in future．She was taken to the palace of the young prince in all her new array．He found her more beautiful than ever，and was married to her a few days afterwards．

Cinderella was as good as she was beautiful．She set aside apartments in the palace for her two sisters，and married them the very same day to two gentlemen of high rank about the Court．





Puss in Boots





A certain miller had three sons，and when he died the sole worldly goods which he bequeathed to them were his mill，his ass，and his cat．

This little legacy was very quickly divided up，and you may be quite sure that neither notary nor attorney were called in to help，for they would speedily have grabbed it all for themselves．

The eldest son took the mill，and the second son took the ass．Consequently all that remained for the youngest son was the cat，and he was not a little disappointed at receiving such a miserable portion．

“My brothers，” said he，“will be able to get a decent living by joining forces，but for my part，as soon as I have eaten my cat and made a muff out of his skin，I am bound to die of hunger．”

These remarks were overheard by Puss，who pretended not to have been listening，and said very soberly and seriously：



“There is not the least need for you to worry，Master．All you have to do is to give me a pouch，and get a pair of boots made for me so that I can walk in the woods．You will find then that your share is not so bad after all．”

Now this cat had often shown himself capable of performing cunning tricks．When catching rats and mice，for example，he would hide himself amongst the meal and hang downwards by the feet as though he were dead．His master，therefore，though he did not build too much on what the cat had said，felt some hope of being assisted in his miserable plight．

On receiving the boots which he had asked for，Puss gaily pulled them on．Then he hung the pouch round his neck，and holding the cords which tied it in front of him with his paws，he sallied forth to a warren where rabbits abounded．Placing some bran and lettuce in the pouch，he stretched himself out and lay as if dead．His plan was to wait until some young rabbit，unlearned in worldly wisdom，should come and rummage in the pouch for the eatables which he had placed there．

Hardly had he laid himself down when things fell out as he wished．A stupid young rabbit went into the pouch，and Master Puss，pulling the cords tight，killed him on the instant．

Well satisfied with his capture，Puss departed to the king's palace．There he demanded an audience，and was ushered upstairs．He entered the royal apartment，and bowed profoundly to the king．

“I bring you，Sire，” said he，“a rabbit from the warren of the marquis of Carabas”（such was the title he invented for his master），“which I am bidden to present to you on his behalf．”

“Tell your master，” replied the king，“that I thank him，and am pleased by his attention．”

Another time the cat hid himself in a wheatfield，keeping the mouth of his bag wide open．Two partridges ventured in，and by pulling the cords tight he captured both of them．Off he went and presented them to the king，just as he had done with the rabbit from the warren．His Majesty was not less gratified by the brace of partridges，and handed the cat a present for himself．

For two or three months Puss went on in this way，every now and again taking to the king，as a present from his master，some game which he had caught．

There came a day when he learned that the king intended to take his daughter，who was the most beautiful princess in the world，for an excursion along the river bank．

“If you will do as I tell you，” said Puss to his master，“your fortune is made．You have only to go and bathe in the river at the spot which I shall point out to you．Leave the rest to me．”

The marquis of Carabas had no idea what plan was afoot，but did as the cat had directed．

While he was bathing the king drew near，and Puss at once began to cry out at the top of his voice：

“Help！help！the marquis of Carabas is drowning！”

At these shouts the king put his head out of the carriage window．He recognized the cat who had so often brought him game，and bade his escort go speedily to the help of the marquis of Carabas．

While they were pulling the poor marquis out of the river，Puss approached the carriage and explained to the king that while his master was bathing robbers had come and taken away his clothes，though he had cried “Stop，thief！” at the top of his voice．As a matter of fact，the rascal had hidden them under a big stone．The king at once commanded the keepers of his wardrobe to go and select a suit of his finest clothes for the marquis of Carabas．

The king received the marquis with many compliments，and as the fine clothes which the latter had just put on set off his good looks（for he was handsome and comely in appearance），the king's daughter found him very much to her liking．Indeed，the marquis of Carabas had not bestowed more than two or three respectful but sentimental glances upon her when she fell madly in love with him．

The king invited him to enter the coach and join the party．Delighted to see his plan so successfully launched，the cat went on ahead，and presently came upon some peasants who were mowing a field．

“Listen，my good fellows，” said he，“if you do not tell the king that the field which you are mowing belongs to the marquis of Carabas，you will all be chopped up into little pieces like mincemeat．”

In due course the king asked the mowers to whom the field on which they were at work belonged．

“It is the property of the marquis of Carabas，” they all cried with one voice，for the threat from Puss had frightened them．

“You have inherited a fine estate，” the king remarked to Carabas．

“As you see for yourself，Sire，” replied the marquis；“this is a meadow which never fails to yield an abundant crop each year．”

Still traveling ahead，the cat came upon some harvesters．

“Listen，my good fellows，” said he，“if you do not declare that every one of these fields belongs to the marquis of Carabas，you will all be chopped up into little bits like mincemeat．”

The king came by a moment later，and wished to know who was the owner of the fields in sight．

“It is the marquis of Carabas，” cried the harvesters．

At this the king was more pleased than ever with the marquis．

Preceding the coach on its journey，the cat made the same threat to all whom he met，and the king grew astonished at the great wealth of the marquis of Carabas．

Finally Master Puss reached a splendid castle，which belonged to an ogre．He was the richest ogre that had ever been known，for all the lands through which the king had passed were part of the castle domain．

The cat had taken care to find out who this ogre was，and what powers he possessed．He now asked for an interview，declaring that he was unwilling to pass so close to the castle without having the honor of paying his respects to the owner．

The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre can，and bade him sit down．

“I have been told，” said Puss，“that you have the power to change yourself into any kind of animal—for example，that you can transform yourself into a lion or an elephant．”

“That is perfectly true，” said the ogre，curtly，“and just to prove it you shall see me turn into a lion．”

Puss was so frightened on seeing a lion before him that he sprang onto the roof—not without difficulty and danger，for his boots were not meant for walking on the tiles．

Perceiving presently that the ogre had abandoned his transformation，Puss descended，and owned to having been thoroughly frightened．

“I have also been told，” he added，“but I can scarcely believe it，that you have the further power to take the shape of the smallest animals—for example，that you can change yourself into a rat or a mouse．I confess that to me it seems quite impossible．”

“Impossible？” cried the ogre；“you shall see！” And in the same moment he changed himself into a mouse，which began to run about the floor．

No sooner did Puss see it than he pounced on it and ate it．

Presently the king came along，and noticing the ogre's beautiful mansion desired to visit it．The cat heard the rumble of the coach as it crossed the castle drawbridge，and running out to the courtyard cried to the king：

“Welcome，your Majesty，to the castle of the marquis of Carabas！”

“What's that？” cried the king．“Is this castle also yours，marquis？Nothing could be finer than this courtyard and the buildings which I see all about．With your permission we will go inside and look round．”

The marquis gave his hand to the young princess，and followed the king as he led the way up the staircase．Entering a great hall they found there a magnificent collation．This had been prepared by the ogre for some friends who were to pay him a visit that very day．The latter had not dared to enter when they learned that the king was there．

The king was now quite as charmed with the excellent qualities of the marquis of Carabas as his daughter．The latter was completely captivated by him．Noting the great wealth of which the marquis was evidently possessed，and having quaffed several cups of wine，he turned to his host，saying：

“It rests with you，marquis，whether you will be my son-in-law．”

The marquis，bowing very low，accepted the honor which the king bestowed upon him．The very same day he married the princess．

Puss became a personage of great importance，and gave up hunting mice，except for amusement．





Little Tom Thumb





Once upon a time there lived a woodcutter and his wife，who had seven children，all boys．The eldest was only ten years old，and the youngest was seven．People were astonished that the woodcutter had had so many children in so short a time，but the reason was that his wife delighted in children，and never had less than two at a time．

They were very poor，and their seven children were a great tax on them，for none of them was yet able to earn his own living．And they were troubled also because the youngest was very delicate and could not speak a word．They mistook for stupidity what was in reality a mark of good sense．This youngest boy was very little．At his birth he was scarcely bigger than a man's thumb，and he was called in consequence “Little Tom Thumb．”

The poor child was the scapegoat of the family，and got the blame for everything．All the same，he was the sharpest and shrewdest of the brothers，and if he spoke but little he listened much．

There came a very bad year，when the famine was so great that these poor people resolved to get rid of their family．One evening，after the children had gone to bed，the woodcutter was sitting in the chimney corner with his wife．His heart was heavy with sorrow as he said to her：

“It must be plain enough to you that we can no longer feed our children．I cannot see them die of hunger before my eyes，and I have made up my mind to take them tomorrow to the forest and lose them there．It will be easy enough to manage，for while they are amusing themselves by collecting fagots we have only to disappear without their seeing us．”

“Ah！” cried the woodcutter's wife，“do you mean to say you are capable of letting your own children be lost？”

In vain did her husband remind her of their terrible poverty；she could not agree．She was poor，but she was their mother．In the end，however，reflecting what a grief it would be to see them die of hunger，she consented to the plan，and went weeping to bed．

Little Tom Thumb had heard all that was said．Having discovered，when in bed，that serious talk was going on，he had got up softly，and had slipped under his father's stool in order to listen without being seen．He went back to bed，but did not sleep a wink for the rest of the night，thinking over what he had better do．In the morning he rose very early and went to the edge of a brook．There he filled his pockets with little white pebbles and came quickly home again．

They all set out，and little Tom Thumb said not a word to his brothers of what he knew．

They went into a forest which was so dense that when only ten paces apart they could not see each other．The woodcutter set about his work，and the children began to collect twigs to make fagots．Presently the father and mother，seeing them busy at their task，edged gradually away，and then hurried off in haste along a little narrow footpath．

When the children found they were alone they began to cry and call out with all their might．Little Tom Thumb let them cry，being confident that they would get back home again．For on the way he had dropped the little white stones which he carried in his pocket all along the path．

“Don't be afraid，brothers，” he said presently；“our parents have left us here，but I will take you home again．Just follow me．”

They fell in behind him，and he led them straight to their house by the same path which they had taken to the forest．At first they dared not go in，but placed themselves against the door，where they could hear everything their father and mother were saying．



Now the woodcutter and his wife had no sooner reached home than the lord of the manor sent them a sum of ten crowns which had been owing from him for a long time，and of which they had given up hope．This put new life into them，for the poor creatures were dying of hunger．

The woodcutter sent his wife off to the butcher at once，and as it was such a long time since they had had anything to eat，she bought three times as much meat as a supper for two required．

When they found themselves once more at table，the woodcutter's wife began to lament．

“Alas！where are our poor children now？” she said；“they could make a good meal off what we have over．Mind you，William，it was you who wished to lose them： I declared over and over again that we should repent it．What are they doing now in that forest？Merciful heavens，perhaps the wolves have already eaten them！A monster you must be to lose your children in this way！”

At last the woodcutter lost patience，for she repeated more than twenty times that he would repent it，and that she had told him so．He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue．

It was not that the woodcutter was less grieved than his wife，but she browbeat him，and he was of the same opinion as many other people，who like a woman to have the knack of saying the right thing，but not the trick of being always in the right．

“Alas！” cried the woodcutter's wife，bursting into tears，“where are now my children，my poor children？”

She said it once so loud that the children at the door heard it plainly．Together they all called out：

“Here we are！Here we are！”

She rushed to open the door for them，and exclaimed，as she embraced them：

“How glad I am to see you again，dear children！You must be very tired and very hungry．And you，Peterkin，how muddy you are—come and let me wash you！”

This Peterkin was her eldest son．She loved him more than all the others because he was inclined to be redheaded，and she herself was rather red．

They sat down at the table and ate with an appetite which it did their parents good to see．They all talked at once，as they recounted the fears they had felt in the forest．

The good souls were delighted to have their children with them again，and the pleasure continued as long as the ten crowns lasted．But when the money was all spent they relapsed into their former sadness．They again resolved to lose the children，and to lead them much further away than they had done the first time，so as to do the job thoroughly．

But though they were careful not to speak openly about it，their conversation did not escape little Tom Thumb，who made up his mind to get out of the situation as he had done on the former occasion．But though he got up early to go and collect his little stones，he found the door of the house doubly locked，and he could not carry out his plan．

He could not think what to do until the woodcutter's wife gave them each a piece of bread for breakfast．Then it occurred to him to use the bread in place of the stones，by throwing crumbs along the path which they took，and he tucked it tight in his pocket．

Their parents led them into the thickest and darkest part of the forest，and as soon as they were there slipped away by a side path and left them．This did not much trouble little Tom Thumb，for he believed he could easily find the way back by means of the bread which he had scattered wherever he walked．But to his dismay he could not discover a single crumb．The birds had come along and eaten it all．

They were in sore trouble now，for with every step they strayed further，and became more and more entangled in the forest．Night came on and a terrific wind arose，which filled them with dreadful alarm．On every side they seemed to hear nothing but the howling of wolves which were coming to eat them up．They dared not speak or move．In addition it began to rain so heavily that they were soaked to the skin．At every step they tripped and fell on the wet ground，getting up again covered with mud，not knowing what to do with their hands．

Little Tom Thumb climbed to the top of a tree，in an endeavour to see something．Looking all about him he espied，far away on the other side of the forest，a little light like that of a candle．He got down from the tree，and was terribly disappointed to find that when he was on the ground he could see nothing at all．After they had walked some distance in the direction of the light，however，he caught a glimpse of it again as they were nearing the edge of the forest．

At last they reached the house where the light was burning，but not without much anxiety，for every time they had to go down into a hollow they lost sight of it．They knocked at the door，and a good dame opened to them．She asked them what they wanted．Little Tom Thumb explained that they were poor children who had lost their way in the forest，and begged her，for pity's sake，to give them a night's lodging．

Noticing what bonny children they all were，the woman began to cry．

“Alas，my poor little dears！” she said；“you do not know the place you have come to！Have you not heard that this is the house of an ogre who eats little children？”

“Alas，madam！” answered little Tom Thumb，trembling like all the rest of his brothers，“what shall we do？One thing is very certain： if you do not take us in，the wolves of the forest will devour us this very night，and that being so we should prefer to be eaten by your husband．Perhaps he may take pity on us，if you will plead for us．”

The ogre's wife，thinking she might be able to hide them from her husband till the next morning，allowed them to come in，and put them to warm near a huge fire，where a whole sheep was cooking on the spit for the ogre's supper．

Just as they were beginning to get warm they heard two or three great bangs at the door．The ogre had returned．His wife hid them quickly under the bed and ran to open the door．

The first thing the ogre did was to ask whether supper was ready and the wine opened．Then without ado he sat down to table．Blood was still dripping from the sheep，but it seemed all the better to him for that．He sniffed to right and left，declaring that he could smell fresh flesh．

“Indeed！” said his wife．“It must be the calf which I have just dressed that you smell．”

“I smell fresh flesh，I tell you，” shouted the ogre，eyeing his wife askance；“and there is something going on here which I do not understand．”

With these words he got up from the table and went straight to the bed．

“Aha！” said he；“so this is the way you deceive me，wicked woman that you are！I have a very great mind to eat you too！It's lucky for you that you are old and tough！I am expecting three ogre friends of mine to pay me a visit in the next few days，and here is a tasty dish which will just come in nicely for them！”



One after another he dragged the children out from under the bed．The poor things threw themselves on their knees，imploring mercy；but they had to deal with the most cruel of all ogres．Far from pitying them，he was already devouring them with his eyes，and repeating to his wife that when cooked with a good sauce they would make most dainty morsels．

Off he went to get a large knife，which he sharpened，as he drew near the poor children，on a long stone in his left hand．

He had already seized one of them when his wife called out to him．“What do you want to do it now for？” she said；“will it not be time enough tomorrow？”

“Hold your tongue，” replied the ogre；“they will be all the more tender．”

“But you have such a lot of meat，” rejoined his wife；“look，there are a calf，two sheep，and half a pig．”

“You are right，” said the ogre；“give them a good supper to fatten them up，and take them to bed．”

The good woman was overjoyed and brought them a splendid supper；but the poor little wretches were so cowed with fright that they could not eat．

As for the ogre，he went back to his drinking，very pleased to have such good entertainment for his friends．He drank a dozen cups more than usual，and was obliged to go off to bed early，for the wine had gone somewhat to his head．

Now the ogre had seven daughters who as yet were only children．These little ogresses all had the most lovely complexions，for，like their father，they ate fresh meat．But they had little round grey eyes，crooked noses，and very large mouths，with long and exceedingly sharp teeth，set far apart．They were not so very wicked at present，but they showed great promise，for already they were in the habit of killing little children to suck their blood．

They had gone to bed early，and were all seven in a great bed，each with a crown of gold upon her head．In the same room there was another bed，equally large．Into this the ogre's wife put the seven little boys，and then went to sleep herself beside her husband．

Little Tom Thumb was fearful lest the ogre should suddenly regret that he had not cut the throats of himself and his brothers the evening before．Having noticed that the ogre's daughters all had golden crowns upon their heads，he got up in the middle of the night and softly placed his own cap and those of his brothers on their heads．Before doing so，he carefully removed the crowns of gold，putting them on his own and his brothers' heads．In this way，if the ogre were to feel like slaughtering them that night he would mistake the girls for the boys，and vice versa．

Things fell out just as he had anticipated．The ogre，waking up at midnight，regretted that he had postponed till the morrow what he could have done overnight．Jumping briskly out of bed，he seized his knife，crying： “Now then，let's see how the little rascals are；I won't make the same mistake twice！”

He groped his way up to his daughters' room，and ap-proached the bed in which were the seven little boys．All were sleeping，with the exception of little Tom Thumb，who was numb with fear when he felt the ogre's hand，as it touched the head of each brother in turn，reach his own．

“Upon my word，” said the ogre，as he felt the golden crowns；“a nice job I was going to make of it！It is very evident that I drank a little too much last night！”

Forthwith he went to the bed where his daughters were，and here he felt the little boys' caps．

“Aha，here are the little scamps！” he cried；“now for a smart bit of work！”

With these words，and without a moment's hesitation，he cut the throats of his seven daughters，and well satisfied with his work went back to bed beside his wife．

No sooner did little Tom Thumb hear him snoring than he woke up his brothers，bidding them dress quickly and follow him．They crept quietly down to the garden，and jumped from the wall．All through the night they ran in haste and terror，without the least idea of where they were going．

When the ogre woke up he said to his wife：

“Go upstairs and dress those little rascals who were here last night．”

The ogre's wife was astonished at her husband's kindness，never doubting that he meant her to go and put on their clothes．She went upstairs，and was horrified to discover her seven daughters bathed in blood，with their throats cut．

She fell at once into a swoon，which is the way of most women in similar circumstances．The ogre，thinking his wife was very long in carrying out his orders，went up to help her，and was no less astounded than his wife at the terrible spectacle which confronted him．

“What's this I have done？” he exclaimed．“I will be revenged on the wretches，and quickly，too！”

He threw a jugful of water over his wife's face，and having brought her round ordered her to fetch his seven-league boots，so that he might overtake the children．

He set off over the countryside，and strode far and wide until he came to the road along which the poor children were travelling．They were not more than a few yards from their home when they saw the ogre striding from hilltop to hilltop，and stepping over rivers as though they were merely tiny streams．Little Tom Thumb espied near at hand a cave in some rocks．In this he hid his brothers，and himself followed them in，while continuing to keep a watchful eye upon the movements of the ogre．

Now the ogre was feeling very tired after so much fruitless marching（for seven-league boots are very fatiguing to their wearer），and felt like taking a little rest．As it happened，he went and sat down on the very rock beneath which the little boys were hiding．Overcome with weariness，he had not sat there long before he fell asleep and began to snore so terribly that the poor children were as frightened as when he had held his great knife to their throats．

Little Tom Thumb was not so alarmed．He told his brothers to flee at once to their home while the ogre was still sleeping soundly，and not to worry about him．They took his advice and ran quickly home．

Little Tom Thumb now approached the ogre and gently pulled off his boots，which he at once donned himself．The boots were very heavy and very large，but being enchanted boots they had the faculty of growing larger or smaller according to the leg they had to suit．Consequently they always fitted as though they had been made for the wearer．

He went straight to the ogre's house，where he found the ogre's wife weeping over her murdered daughters．

“Your husband，” said little Tom Thumb，“is in great danger，for he has been captured by a gang of thieves，and the latter have sworn to kill him if he does not hand over all his gold and silver．Just as they had the dagger at his throat，he caught sight of me and begged me to come to you and thus rescue him from his terrible plight．You are to give me everything of value which he possesses，without keeping back a thing，otherwise he will be slain without mercy．As the matter is urgent he wished me to wear his seven-league boots，to save time，and also to prove to you that I am no impostor．”

The ogre's wife，in great alarm，gave him immediately all that she had，for although this was an ogre who devoured little children，he was by no means a bad husband．

Little Tom Thumb，laden with all the ogre's wealth，forthwith repaired to his father's house，where he was received with great joy．




Many people do not agree about this last adventure，and pretend that little Tom Thumb never committed this theft from the ogre，and only took the seven-league boots，about which he had no compunction，since they were only used by the ogre for catching little children．These folks assert that they are in a position to know，having been guests at the woodcutter's cottage．They further say that when little Tom Thumb had put on the ogre's boots，he went off to the Court，where he knew there was great anxiety concerning the result of a battle which was being fought by an army two hundred leagues away．

They say that he went to the king and undertook，if desired，to bring news of the army before the day was out；and that the king promised him a large sum of money if he could carry out his project．

Little Tom Thumb brought news that very night，and this first errand having brought him into notice，he made as much money as he wished．For not only did the king pay him handsomely to carry orders to the army，but many ladies at the court gave him anything he asked to get them news of their lovers，and this was his greatest source of income．He was occasionally entrusted by wives with letters to their husbands，but they paid him so badly，and this branch of the business brought him in so little，that he did not even bother to reckon what he made from it．

After acting as courier for some time，and amassing great wealth thereby，little Tom Thumb returned to his father's house，and was there greeted with the greatest joy imaginable．He made all his family comfortable，buying newly created positions for his father and brothers．In this way he set them all up，not forgetting at the same time to look well after himself．





The Fairy





Once upon a time there lived a widow with two daughters．The elder was often mistaken for her mother，so like her was she both in nature and in looks；parent and child being so disagreeable and arrogant that no one could live with them．

The younger girl，who took after her father in the gentleness and sweetness of her disposition，was also one of the prettiest girls imaginable．

The mother doted on the elder daughter—naturally enough，since she resembled her so closely—and disliked the younger one as intensely．She made the latter live in the kitchen and work hard from morning till night．

One of the poor child's many duties was to go twice a day and draw water from a spring a good half-mile away，bringing it back in a large pitcher．

One day when she was at the spring an old woman came up and begged for a drink．

“Why，certainly，good mother，” the pretty lass replied．Rinsing her pitcher，she drew some water from the cleanest part of the spring and handed it to the dame，lifting up the jug so that she might drink the more easily．

Now this old woman was a fairy，who had taken the form of a poor village dame to see just how far the girl's good nature would go．“You are so pretty，” she said，when she had finished drinking，“and so polite，that I am determined to bestow a gift upon you．This is the boon I grant you： with every word that you utter there shall fall from your mouth either a flower or a precious stone．”

When the girl reached home she was scolded by her mother for being so long in coming back from the spring．

“I am sorry to have been so long，mother，” said the poor child．

As she spoke these words there fell from her mouth two roses，two pearls，and two diamonds．

“What's this？” cried her mother；“did I see pearls and diamonds dropping out of your mouth？What does this mean，dear daughter？”（This was the first time she had ever addressed her daughter affectionately．）

The poor child told a simple tale of what had happened，and in speaking scattered diamonds right and left．

“Really，” said her mother，“I must send my own child there．Come here，Fanchon；look what comes out of your sister's mouth whenever she speaks！Wouldn't you like to be able to do the same？All you have to do is to go and draw some water at the spring，and when a poor woman asks you for a drink，give it her very nicely．”

“Oh，indeed！” replied the ill-mannered girl；“don't you wish you may see me going there！”

“I tell you that you are to go，” said her mother，“and to go this instant．”

Very sulkily the girl went off，taking with her the best silver flagon in the house．No sooner had she reached the spring than she saw a lady，magnificently attired，who came towards her from the forest，and asked for a drink．This was the same fairy who had appeared to her sister，masquerading now as a princess in order to see how far this girl's ill-nature would carry her．

“Do you think I have come here just to get you a drink？” said the loutish damsel，arrogantly．“I suppose you think I brought a silver flagon here specially for that purpose—it's so likely，isn't it？Drink from the spring，if you want to！”

“You are not very polite，” said the fairy，displaying no sign of anger．“Well，in return for your lack of courtesy I decree that for every word you utter a snake or a toad shall drop out of your mouth．”



The moment her mother caught sight of her coming back she cried out，“Well，daughter？”

“Well，mother？” replied the rude girl．As she spoke two vipers and two toads were spat out of her mouth．

“Gracious heavens！” cried her mother；“what do I see？Your sister is the cause of this，and I will make her pay for it！”

Off she ran to thrash the poor child，but the latter fled away and hid in the forest nearby．The king's son met her on his way home from hunting，and noticing how pretty she was inquired what she was doing all alone，and what she was weeping about．

“Alas，sir，” she cried；“my mother has driven me from home！”

As she spoke the prince saw four or five pearls and as many diamonds fall from her mouth．He begged her to tell him how this came about，and she told him the whole story．

The king's son fell in love with her，and reflecting that such a gift as had been bestowed upon her was worth more than any dowry which another maiden might bring him，he took her to the palace of his royal father，and there married her．

As for the sister，she made herself so hateful that even her mother drove her out of the house．Nowhere could the wretched girl find anyone who would take her in，and at last she lay down in the forest and died．





Ricky of Tuft





Once upon a time there was a queen who bore a son so ugly and misshapen that for some time it was doubtful if he would have human form at all．But a fairy who was present at his birth promised that he should have plenty of brains，and added that by virtue of the gift which she had just bestowed upon him he would be able to impart to the person whom he should love best the same degree of intelligence which he possessed himself．

This somewhat consoled the poor queen，who was greatly disappointed at having brought into the world such a hideous brat．And indeed，no sooner did the child begin to speak than his sayings proved to be full of shrewdness，while all that he did was somehow so clever that he charmed everyone．

I forgot to mention that when he was born he had a little tuft of hair upon his head．For this reason he was called Ricky of the Tuft，Ricky being his family name．

Some seven or eight years later the queen of a neighboring kingdom gave birth to twin daughters．The first one to come into the world was more beautiful than the dawn，and the queen was so overjoyed that it was feared her great excitement might do her some harm．The same fairy who had assisted at the birth of Ricky of the Tuft was present，and in order to moderate the transports of the queen she declared that this little princess would have no sense at all，and would be as stupid as she was beautiful．The queen was deeply mortified，and a moment or two later her chagrin became greater still，for the second daughter proved to be extremely ugly．

“Do not be distressed，Madam，” said the fairy；“your daughter shall be recompensed in another way．She shall have so much good sense that her lack of beauty will scarcely be noticed．”

“May Heaven grant it！” said the queen；“but is there no means by which the elder，who is so beautiful，can be endowed with some intelligence？”

“In the matter of brains I can do nothing for her，Madam，” said the fairy，“but as regards beauty I can do a great deal．As there is nothing I would not do to please you，I will bestow upon her the power of making beautiful any person who shall greatly please her．”

As the two princesses grew up their perfections increased，and everywhere the beauty of the elder and the wit of the younger were the subject of common talk．It is equally true that their defects also increased as they became older．The younger grew uglier every minute，and the elder daily became more stupid．Either she answered nothing at all when spoken to，or replied with some idiotic remark．At the same time she was so awkward that she could not set four china vases on the mantelpiece without breaking one of them，nor drink a glass of water without spilling half of it over her clothes．

Now although the elder girl possessed the great advantage which beauty always confers upon youth，she was nevertheless outshone in almost all company by her younger sister．At first everyone gathered round the beauty to see and admire her，but very soon they were all attracted by the graceful and easy conversation of the clever one．In a very short time the elder girl would be left entirely alone，while everybody clustered round her sister．

The elder princess was not so stupid that she was not aware of this，and she would willingly have surrendered all her beauty for half her sister's cleverness．Sometimes she was ready to die of grief，for the queen，though a sensible woman，could not refrain from occasionally reproaching her with her stupidity．

The princess had retired one day to a wood to bemoan her misfortune，when she saw approaching her an ugly little man，of very disagreeable appearance，but clad in magnificent attire．

This was the young prince Ricky of the Tuft．He had fallen in love with her portrait，which was everywhere to be seen，and had left his father's kingdom in order to have the pleasure of seeing and talking to her．Delighted to meet her thus alone，he approached with every mark of respect and politeness．But while he paid her the usual compliments he noticed that she was plunged in melancholy．

“I cannot understand，madam，” he said，“how anyone with your beauty can be so sad as you appear．I can boast of having seen many fair ladies，and I declare that none of them could compare in beauty with you．”

“It is very kind of you to say so，sir，” answered the princess；and stopped there，at a loss what to say further．

“Beauty，” said Ricky，“is of such great advantage that everything else can be disregarded；and I do not see that the possessor of it can have anything much to grieve about．”

To this the princess replied：

“I would rather be as plain as you are and have some sense，than be as beautiful as I am and at the same time stupid．”

“Nothing more clearly displays good sense，madam，than a belief that one is not possessed of it．It follows，therefore，that the more one has，the more one fears it to be wanting．”

“I am not sure about that，” said the princess；“but I know only too well that I am very stupid，and this is the reason of the misery which is nearly killing me．”

“If that is all that troubles you，madam，I can easily put an end to your suffering．”

“How will you manage that？” said the princess．

“I am able，madam，” said Ricky of the Tuft，“to bestow as much good sense as it is possible to possess on the person whom I love the most．You are that person，and it therefore rests with you to decide whether you will acquire so much intelligence．The only condition is that you shall consent to marry me．”

The princess was dumbfounded，and remained silent．

“I can see，” pursued Ricky，“that this suggestion perplexes you，and I am not surprised．But I will give you a whole year to make up your mind to it．”

The princess had so little sense，and at the same time desired it so ardently，that she persuaded herself the end of this year would never come．So she accepted the offer which had been made to her．No sooner had she given her word to Ricky that she would marry him within one year from that very day，than she felt a complete change come over her．She found herself able to say all that she wished with the greatest ease，and to say it in an elegant，finished，and natural manner．She at once engaged Ricky in a brilliant and lengthy conversation，holding her own so well that Ricky feared he had given her a larger share of sense than he had retained for himself．

On her return to the palace amazement reigned throughout the Court at such a sudden and extraordinary change．Whereas formerly they had been accustomed to hear her give vent to silly，pert remarks，they now heard her express herself sensibly and very wittily．

The entire Court was overjoyed．The only person not too pleased was the younger sister，for now that she had no longer the advantage over the elder in wit，she seemed nothing but a little fright in comparison．

The king himself often took her advice，and several times held his councils in her apartment．

The news of this change spread abroad，and the princes of the neighboring kingdoms made many attempts to captivate her．Almost all asked her in marriage．But she found none with enough sense，and so she listened to all without promising herself to any．

At last came one who was so powerful，so rich，so witty，and so handsome，that she could not help being somewhat attracted by him．Her father noticed this，and told her she could make her own choice of a husband： she had only to declare herself．

Now the more sense one has，the more difficult it is to make up one's mind in an affair of this kind．After thanking her father，therefore，she asked for a little time to think it over．

In order to ponder quietly what she had better do she went to walk in a wood—the very one，as it happened，where she encountered Ricky of the Tuft．While she walked，deep in thought，she heard beneath her feet a thudding sound，as though many people were running busily to and fro．Listening more attentively she heard voices．“Bring me that boiler，” said one；then another—“Put some wood on that fire！”

At that moment the ground opened，and she saw below what appeared to be a large kitchen full of cooks and scullions，and all the train of attendants which the preparation of a great banquet involves．A gang of some twenty or thirty spit-turners emerged and took up their positions round a very long table in a path in the wood．They all wore their cook's caps on one side，and with their basting implements in their hands they kept time together as they worked，to the lilt of a melodious song．

The princess was astonished by this spectacle，and asked for whom their work was being done．

“For Prince Ricky of the Tuft，madam，” said the foreman of the gang；“his wedding is tomorrow．”

At this the princess was more surprised than ever．In a flash she remembered that it was a year to the very day since she had promised to marry Prince Ricky of the Tuft，and was taken aback by the recollection．The reason she had forgotten was that when she made the promise she was still without sense，and with the acquisition of that intelligence which the prince had bestowed upon her，all memory of her former stupidities had been blotted out．



She had not gone another thirty paces when Ricky of the Tuft appeared before her，gallant and resplendent，like a prince upon his wedding day．

“As you see，madam，” he said，“I keep my word to the minute．I do not doubt that you have come to keep yours，and by giving me your hand to make me the happiest of men．”

“I will be frank with you，” replied the princess．“I have not yet made up my mind on the point，and I am afraid I shall never be able to take the decision you desire．”

“You astonish me，madam，” said Ricky of the Tuft．

“I can well believe it，” said the princess，“and undoubtedly，if I had to deal with a clown，or a man who lacked good sense，I should feel myself very awkwardly situated．‘A princess must keep her word，’ he would say，‘and you must marry me because you promised to！’ But I am speaking to a man of the world，of the greatest good sense，and I am sure that he will listen to reason．As you are aware，I could not make up my mind to marry you even when I was entirely without sense；how can you expect that to-day，possessing the intelligence you bestowed on me，which makes me still more difficult to please than formerly，I should take a decision which I could not take then？If you wished so much to marry me，you were very wrong to relieve me of my stupidity，and to let me see more clearly than I did．”

“If a man who lacked good sense，” replied Ricky of the Tuft，“would be justified，as you have just said，in reproaching you for breaking your word，why do you expect，madam，that I should act differently where the happiness of my whole life is at stake？Is it reasonable that people who have sense should be treated worse than those who have none？Would you maintain that for a moment—you，who so markedly have sense，and desired so ardently to have it？But，pardon me，let us get to the facts．With the exception of my ugliness，is there anything about me which displeases you？Are you dissatisfied with my breeding，my brains，my disposition，or my manners？”

“In no way，” replied the princess；“I like exceedingly all that you have displayed of the qualities you mention．”

“In that case，” said Ricky of the Tuft，“happiness will be mine，for it lies in your power to make me the most attractive of men．”

“How can that be done？” asked the princess．

“It will happen of itself，” replied Ricky of the Tuft，“if you love me well enough to wish that it be so．To remove your doubts，madam，let me tell you that the same fairy who on the day of my birth bestowed upon me the power of endowing with intelligence the woman of my choice，gave to you also the power of endowing with beauty the man whom you should love，and on whom you should wish to confer this favour．”

“If that is so，” said the princess，“I wish with all my heart that you may become the handsomest and most attractive prince in the world，and I give you without reserve the boon which it is mine to bestow．”

No sooner had the princess uttered these words than Ricky of the Tuft appeared before her eyes as the handsomest，most graceful and attractive man that she had ever set eyes on．

Some people assert that this was not the work of fairy enchantment，but that love alone brought about the transformation．They say that the princess，as she mused upon her lover's constancy，upon his good sense，and his many admirable qualities of heart and head，grew blind to the deformity of his body and the ugliness of his face；that his hump back seemed no more than was natural in a man who could make the courtliest of bows，and that the dreadful limp which had formerly distressed her now betokened nothing more than a certain diffidence and charming deference of manner．They say further that she found his eyes shine all the brighter for their squint，and that this defect in them was to her but a sign of passionate love；while his great red nose she found nought but martial and heroic．

However that may be，the princess promised to marry him on the spot，provided only that he could obtain the consent of her royal father．

The king knew Ricky of the Tuft to be a prince both wise and witty，and on learning of his daughter's regard for him，he accepted him with pleasure as a son-in-law．

The wedding took place upon the morrow，just as Ricky of the Tuft had foreseen，and in accordance with the arrangements he had long ago put in train．





Blue Beard





Once upon a time there was a man who owned splendid town and country houses，gold and silver plate，tapestries and coaches gilt all over．But the poor fellow had a blue beard，and this made him so ugly and frightful that there was not a woman or girl who did not run away at sight of him．

Amongst his neighbors was a lady of high degree who had two surpassingly beautiful daughters．He asked for the hand of one of these in marriage，leaving it to their mother to choose which should be bestowed upon him．Both girls，however，raised objections，and his offer was bandied from one to the other，neither being able to bring herself to accept a man with a blue beard．Another reason for their distaste was the fact that he had already married several wives，and no one knew what had become of them．

In order that they might become better acquainted，Blue Beard invited the two girls，with their mother and three or four of their best friends，to meet a party of young men from the neighborhood at one of his country houses．



Here they spent eight whole days，and throughout their stay there was a constant round of picnics，hunting and fishing expeditions，dances，dinners，and luncheons；and they never slept at all，through spending all the night in playing merry pranks upon each other．In short，everything went so gaily that the younger daughter began to think the master of the house had not so very blue a beard after all，and that he was an exceedingly agreeable man．

As soon as the party returned to town their marriage took place．At the end of a month Blue Beard informed his wife that important business obliged him to make a journey into a distant part of the country，which would occupy at least six weeks．He begged her to amuse herself well during his absence，and suggested that she should invite some of her friends and take them，if she liked，to the country．He was particularly anxious that she should enjoy herself thoroughly．

“Here，” he said，“are the keys of the two large storerooms，and here is the one that locks up the gold and silver plate which is not in everyday use．This key belongs to the strongboxes where my gold and silver is kept，this to the caskets containing my jewels；while here you have the master key which gives admittance to all the apartments．As regards this little key，it is the key of the small room at the end of the long passage on the lower floor．You may open everything，you may go everywhere，but I forbid you to enter this little room．And I forbid you so seriously that if you were indeed to open the door，I should be so angry that I might do anything．”



She promised to follow out these instructions exactly，and after embracing her，Blue Beard steps into his coach and is off upon his journey．

Her neighbors and friends did not wait to be invited before coming to call upon the young bride，so great was their eagerness to see the splendors of her house．They had not dared to venture while her husband was there，for his blue beard frightened them．But in less than no time there they were，running in and out of the rooms，the closets，and the wardrobes，each of which was finer than the last．

Presently they went upstairs to the storerooms，and there they could not admire enough the profusion and magnificence of the tapestries，beds，sofas，cabinets，tables，and stands．There were mirrors in which they could view themselves from top to toe，some with frames of plate glass，others with frames of silver and gilt lacquer，that were the most superb and beautiful things that had ever been seen．

They were loud and persistent in their envy of their friend's good fortune．She，on the other hand，derived little amusement from the sight of all these riches，the reason being that she was impatient to go and inspect the little room on the lower floor．So overcome with curiosity was she that，without reflecting upon the discourtesy of leaving her guests，she ran down a private staircase，so precipitately that twice or thrice she nearly broke her neck，and so reached the door of the little room．

There she paused for a while，thinking of the prohibition which her husband had made，and reflecting that harm might come to her as a result of disobedience．But the temptation was so great that she could not conquer it．Taking the little key，with a trembling hand she opened the door of the room．

At first she saw nothing，for the windows were closed，but after a few moments she perceived dimly that the floor was entirely covered with clotted blood，and that in this were reflected the dead bodies of several women that hung along the walls．These were all the wives of Blue Beard，whose throats he had cut，one after another．

She thought to die of terror，and the key of the room，which she had just withdrawn from the lock，fell from her hand．

When she had somewhat regained her senses，she picked up the key，closed the door，and went up to her chamber to compose herself a little．But this she could not do，for her nerves were too shaken．Noticing that the key of the little room was stained with blood，she wiped it two or three times．But the blood did not go．She washed it well，and even rubbed it with sand and grit．Always the blood remained．For the key was bewitched，and there was no means of cleaning it completely．When the blood was removed from one side，it reappeared on the other．

Blue Beard returned from his journey that very evening．He had received some letters on the way，he said，from which he learned that the business upon which he had set forth had just been concluded to his satisfaction．His wife did everything she could to make it appear that she was delighted by his speedy return．

On the morrow he demanded the keys．She gave them to him，but with so trembling a hand that he guessed at once what had happened．

“How comes it，” he said to her，“that the key of the little room is not with the others？”

“I must have left it upstairs upon my table，” she said．

“Do not fail to bring it to me presently，” said Blue Beard．

After several delays the key had to be brought．Blue Beard examined it，and addressed his wife．

“Why is there blood on this key？”

“I do not know at all，” replied the poor woman，paler than death．

“You do not know at all？” exclaimed Blue Beard；“I know well enough．You wanted to enter the little room！Well，madam，enter it you shall—you shall go and take your place among the ladies you have seen there．”

She threw herself at her husband's feet，asking his pardon with tears，and with all the signs of a true repentance for her disobedience．She would have softened a rock，in her beauty and distress，but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any stone．

“You must die，madam，” he said；“and at once．”

“Since I must die，” she replied，gazing at him with eyes that were wet with tears，“give me a little time to say my prayers．”

“I give you one quarter of an hour，” replied Blue Beard，“but not a moment longer．”

When the poor girl was alone，she called her sister to her and said：

“Sister Anne”—for that was her name—“go up，I implore you，to the top of the tower，and see if my brothers are not approaching．They promised that they would come and visit me today．If you see them，make signs to them to hasten．”

Sister Anne went up to the top of the tower，and the poor unhappy girl cried out to her from time to time：

“Anne，Sister Anne，do you see nothing coming？”

And Sister Anne replied：

“I see nought but dust in the sun and the green grass growing．”

Presently Blue Beard，grasping a great cutlass，cried out at the top of his voice：

“Come down quickly，or I shall come upstairs myself．”

“Oh please，one moment more，” called out his wife．

And at the same moment she cried in a whisper：

“Anne，Sister Anne，do you see nothing coming？”

“I see nought but dust in the sun and the green grass growing．”

“Come down at once，I say，” shouted Blue Beard，“or I will come upstairs myself．”

“I am coming，” replied his wife．

Then she called：

“Anne，Sister Anne，do you see nothing coming？”

“I see，” replied Sister Anne，“a great cloud of dust which comes this way．”

“Is it my brothers？”

“Alas，sister，no；it is but a flock of sheep．”

“Do you refuse to come down？” roared Blue Beard．

“One little moment more，” exclaimed his wife．

Once more she cried：

“Anne，Sister Anne，do you see nothing coming？”

“I see，” replied her sister，“two horsemen who come this way，but they are as yet a long way off....Heaven be praised，” she exclaimed a moment later，“they are my brothers....I am signaling to them all I can to hasten．”

Blue Beard let forth so mighty a shout that the whole house shook．The poor wife went down and cast herself at his feet，all disheveled and in tears．

“That avails you nothing，” said Blue Beard；“you must die．”

Seizing her by the hair with one hand，and with the other brandishing the cutlass aloft，he made as if to cut off her head．The poor woman，turning towards him and fixing a dying gaze upon him，begged for a brief moment in which to collect her thoughts．

“No！no！” he cried；“commend your soul to Heaven．” And raising his arm—

At this very moment there came so loud a knocking at the gate that Blue Beard stopped short．The gate was opened，and two horsemen dashed in，who drew their swords and rode straight at Blue Beard．The latter recognized them as the brothers of his wife—one of them a dragoon，and the other a musketeer—and fled instantly in an effort to escape．But the two brothers were so close upon him that they caught him ere he could gain the first flight of steps．They plunged their swords through his body and left him dead．The poor woman was nearly as dead as her husband，and had not the strength to rise and embrace her brothers．

It was found that Blue Beard had no heirs，and that consequently his wife became mistress of all his wealth．She devoted a portion to arranging a marriage between her sister Anne and a young gentleman with whom the latter had been for some time in love，while another portion purchased a captain's commission for each of her brothers．The rest formed a dowry for her own marriage with a very worthy man，who banished from her mind all memory of the evil days she had spent with Blue Beard．
