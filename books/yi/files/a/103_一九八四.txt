The Principles of Newspeak



Why I Write







第一部





第一章


这是四月里的一天，天气晴朗却又寒冷，时钟敲了十三下。温斯顿·史密斯快步溜进胜利大厦的玻璃门。他低垂着头，想躲过阴冷的风，但动作还是不够快，没能把一股卷着沙土的旋风关到门外。

门厅里有股煮卷心菜和旧床垫的气味。门厅那头钉着一张彩色宣传画，大得不适合钉在室内，上面只有一张巨大的面孔，宽度超过一米。那是个四十五岁左右的男人，蓄着浓密的黑色八字胡，面相粗犷而英俊。温斯顿朝楼梯走去。想坐电梯是没希望的，即使在情形最好时电梯也很少开。目前白天停电，这是为迎接仇恨周的节约运动中的做法之一。温斯顿所住的公寓在七楼，他现年三十九岁，他的右脚脖上方还有一处因静脉曲张形成的溃疡，所以只能缓慢地走楼梯上去，中途还歇了几次。每层楼梯平台正对电梯门的墙上，那张有着巨大面孔的宣传画从那里凝视着，它是那种设计得眼神能跟着你到处移动的肖像画。“老大哥在看着你”，下方印着这样的标题。

在公寓里，有个洪亮的声音正在念一连串数字，跟生铁产量有关。声音来自一块长方形金属板，它像一面毛玻璃面的镜子，嵌在右墙上。温斯顿扭了一下开关，声音多少低了一点，但仍清晰可闻。这个装置（叫做电屏）的声音能关小，然而无法完全关掉。他走到窗前。他的体形偏小，瘦弱，作为党员制服的蓝色工作服只是让他更显单薄。他长着淡色头发，面色红润自然，皮肤因为使用劣质肥皂和钝剃须刀片而变得粗糙，然而冬天的寒意才刚刚结束。

外面，即使隔着关闭的窗户，看去仍然一副寒冷的样子。下面街道上，小股的旋风卷动尘土及碎纸打着旋越飞越高。尽管出了太阳，天空也蓝得刺眼，但是除了到处张贴的宣传画，似乎一切都没了颜色。那张蓄着黑色八字胡的脸从每个能望到两边的街角居高临下盯着。正对面的房屋前面就贴了一张，标题印着“老大哥在看着你”，那双黑色眼睛死盯着温斯顿的。下面临街地方还有另外一张宣传画，一角已破，在一阵阵拍打着，把一个词一会儿盖住，一会儿展开：“英社”。远处，一架直升飞机从屋顶间掠过，像苍蝇般在空中盘旋一会儿，然后划了道弧线急飞而去。那是警察巡逻队，正在窥视人们的窗户。但巡逻队还不足为惧，为惧的只是思想警察。

在温斯顿身后，电屏传出的声音仍在喋喋不休地播报有关生铁产量和超额完成第九个三年计划的事。电屏能同时接收和发送，温斯顿所发出的任何声音，只要高于极低的细语，就能被它拾音。而且不仅如此，只要他待在那块金属板的视域之内，他就不仅能被听到，而且也能被看到。当然，在具体某一时刻，你没办法知道自己是否正在被监视。思想警察接进某条电线的频度如何以及按照何种规定进行，都只能臆测而已，甚至有可能他们每时每刻都在监视着每个人。但无论如何，他们什么时候想，就可以什么时候接上你那条电线。你只能生活——确实是生活，一开始是习惯，后来变成了本能——在一个设想之下，即你所发出的每个声音都会被偷听，除非在黑暗里，否则你的每个举动都会被细察。

温斯顿保持背对电屏，这样比较安全，不过他也知道，即使是背部，也可能暴露出什么。一公里之外是真理部，那是他上班的地方，是幢在一片不堪入目的地带拔地而起的白色大型建筑。这里——他略有几分厌恶地想道——这里就是伦敦，第一空域的主要城市，第一空域本身是大洋国人口第三大省份。他绞尽脑汁想找回一点童年记忆，以便让他记起伦敦是否一直就是这个样子：满眼都是摇摇欲垮的建于十九世纪的房屋，侧墙靠木头架子撑着，窗户用纸板挡着，屋顶是瓦楞铁皮，破旧的院墙东歪西斜，是否一直就是这样？在挨过炸弹的地方，空中飞腾着灰泥和尘土，野花在一堆堆瓦砾上蔓生，还冒出许多龌龊的聚居区，也就是鸡舍一样的木板屋，是否一直是这样？可是没用，他想不起来：他的童年除了一系列光亮的静态画面，什么也没留下，但那些画面都缺少背景，大部分也不可理解。

真理部——用新话(1)来说就是“真部”——跟视野中能看到的其他建筑明显不同。它是座巨大的金字塔形结构，白色水泥熠熠发亮。它拔地入云，一级叠一级，达三百米之高。从温斯顿所站的地方，刚好能看到党的三条标语，以漂亮的美术字镌刻在真理部大楼正面：



战争即和平

自由即奴役

无知即力量



据说真理部在地面上的房间就多达三千间，另外还有相应的地下附属建筑。此外只有三座外表及规模类似的大楼分散坐落在伦敦。周围建筑彻底被那三座大楼比了下去，所以站在胜利大厦顶上，同时可以看到这四座大楼，分别为四个部的所在地，政府的所有职能就分工到了这四个部。真理部负责新闻、娱乐、教育以及美术，和平部负责战争，仁爱部负责维持法律和秩序，富足部负责经济事务。这四个部的名称用新话来说，分别是“真部”、“和部”、“爱部”和“富部”。

仁爱部是真正令人心惊胆战的地方。那里根本没有窗户。温斯顿从未去过仁爱部，也未曾进入过它的半公里外缘范围之内。那里非公莫入，进去时，还要经过一段布着带刺铁丝网的错综复杂的道路、一道道钢门以及机枪暗堡，甚至在通向它外围屏障的街道上，也有面目狰狞的警卫在转悠。他们身穿黑色制服，手持两节警棍。

温斯顿突然转过身，脸上已经换上一副从容而乐观的表情。面对电屏时，这样做是明智的。他穿过房间走进那间很小的厨房。这个时间离开部里，就放弃了在食堂的一顿午餐，他也知道厨房里除了一大块黑面包别无他物，得把它留到明天早上当早餐。他从架子上拿了个装有无色液体的瓶子，上面简单的白标签上印着“胜利杜松子酒”。如同中国的米酒，它散发的也是一股令人作呕、油一般的气味。温斯顿倒了快有一茶杯，鼓了鼓勇气，然后像喝药一样一口气灌了下去。

马上，他脸变得通红，眼里流出了泪水。那玩意儿像是硝酸，而且不仅如此，喝的时候，还给人一种后脑勺挨了一胶皮警棍的感觉。过了一会儿，他胃里的灼热感消退了一点，一切好像没那么难受了。他从印有“胜利香烟”的压扁了的烟盒里抽出一根烟，不小心把它拿倒了，烟丝因此掉了出来。他又抽出一根，这次好了点。他回到起居室，在位于电屏左侧的一张小桌子那里坐下来。他从桌子抽屉里取出一支笔杆、一瓶墨水和一个四开大的空白厚本子，它的封底是红色，封面压有大理石纹。

不知为何，起居室里的电屏安装位置不同寻常。它通常在远端的墙上，这样可以监视到整个房间，这张电屏却是在较长那面墙上，正对窗户。电屏一侧有个浅凹的地方，温斯顿就坐在这里。建这幢公寓楼时，这地方很可能原意是用来摆书橱。温斯顿坐在凹处，尽量把身子往后靠，这样可以保持在电屏的视域范围之外。当然，他的声音仍会被听到，不过只要待在目前位置，他就不会被看到。他之所以想到这会儿要做的这件事，部分起因就是这个房间不一般的布局。

同样让他想到做这件事的，还有他从抽屉里拿出来的本子，这是个异常漂亮的本子，纸质光滑细腻，因为岁月久远而变得有点泛黄。那种纸至少已经停产了四十年，但是他估计那个本子的年头远不止四十年。他在一间肮脏的小杂货铺的橱窗里看到它放在那里，那间铺子位于市内某个贫民区（究竟是哪个区，他现在不记得了），当时他马上有了种不可遏制的冲动想拥有它。党员不应该进入普通店铺（被称为“在自由市场买卖”），但这一规定并未严格执行，因为许多东西——如鞋带和剃须刀片——除非去那里，否则就买不到。他往街上左右方向迅速瞄了瞄，然后溜进去花两元五角钱买下了它，也没想它能派什么用场。他知错犯错地把它放在公文包里带回家，上面就算什么也不写，拥有它也算是有违原则。

他准备要做的，是开始写日记，这不算非法（没什么是非法的，因为不再有法律），然而被发现的话，有理由可以肯定惩罚会是死刑，或者至少二十五年劳改。温斯顿把钢笔尖装到笔杆上，用嘴吸掉上面的油脂。钢笔是种过时的东西，就连签字时也很少用，他偷偷摸摸而且是费了些事才得到一杆，只因为他感觉那种漂亮细腻的纸张配得上用真正的钢笔尖在上面书写，而不是拿蘸水笔划拉。其实他还不习惯用手写字，除了写很短的便条，他通常什么都对着口述记录器口授，对目前想做的这件事而言，当然不可能那样做。他把钢笔蘸在墨水里，然后踌躇了仅仅一秒钟。他全身感到一阵战栗，落笔是件决定性行为。他以笨拙的小字体写道：



一九八四年四月四日



他往后靠着坐在那里，陷入一种完全无助的感觉。首先，他对是不是一九八四年完全没把握，不过可以肯定是那年前后，因为他对自己是三十九岁这点很有把握，而且相信自己是出生于一九四四年或一九四五年。不过如今在确定年份时，不可能没有一两年误差。

突然，他想起一个问题，他写日记是为了谁？为了未来，为了未出生的人。他的心思围绕那堪可怀疑的年份转了一会儿，心里忽然咯噔一下，想起新话中的“双重思想”一词。他第一次想到自己所干之事的艰巨性：你怎样去跟未来沟通？根本说来，这不可能。要么未来与现在相似，在此情况下，未来也不会听他说；要么未来跟现在不同，他此刻的为难便毫无意义。

他对着那张纸呆看了一会儿。电屏里已经换播刺耳的军乐声。奇怪的是，他似乎不仅失去了表达自我的力量，甚至忘了他本来想说什么。过去几周里，他一直在为这一刻做准备，从未想到除了勇气还需要别的什么。真正动笔不难，需要做的，只是将他大脑里没完没了、焦躁不安的内心独白转移到纸上就行了。这种情况实际上已经持续好几年，然而在这一刻，就连这种独白也枯竭了。另外，那处静脉曲张的溃疡又痒得难受，可是他不敢搔，因为一搔总会红肿发炎。时间一分一秒过去，除了面前纸上的空白、脚脖上方的皮肤痒、电屏里尖锐刺耳的音乐和喝酒造成的一丝醉意，他别无感觉。

突然，他完全是匆匆忙忙地写起来，但他对正在写下的东西并非全然心里有数。他用儿童式小字体在纸上随意写着，一开始漏了大写，到最后连标点也不用：



一九八四年四月四日。昨天晚上去看了电影，全是战争片。很好看的一部是关于一艘满载难民的船在地中海某处被轰炸的事。观众很开心地看到一个胖男人奋力游泳逃离一架直升飞机追赶的镜头。一开始看到他像头海豚一样在水里扑腾，然后是通过直升飞机上的瞄准器看到他，接着他全身都是枪眼，他身体周围的海水都变成了粉红色，突然沉下去，好像枪眼导致进水，观众在他下沉时大声哄笑。然后看到的是一条坐满儿童的救生艇，上边有架直升飞机在盘旋。有个可能是犹太人的中年妇女坐在船头，抱着个大约三岁的小男孩。小男孩吓得尖叫，把头深深扎进她怀里，似乎想在她身上钻个洞而那个女人把胳膊围绕着他安慰他尽管她自己也已经害怕得脸色发青，一直在尽量掩护着他似乎她以为她的双臂能为他挡住子弹。然后直升飞机往他们中间投下一个二十公斤重的炸弹一道巨闪小艇变成了碎片。接着是个拍得很清晰的镜头是个小孩的手臂往空中飞得高高安在直升飞机前端的摄影机肯定在追着它拍党员座位那里传来一片鼓掌声但在群众所坐那里有个女人突然无故喧哗起来嚷叫着说他们不该放给孩子看他们做得不对别放给小孩看直到警察去把她架了出去我不认为她会有什么事谁也不关心群众说什么群众的典型反应他们从来不会——



温斯顿停下笔，部分原因是他感到肌肉痉挛。他不知道是什么让他的笔尖流淌出这些垃圾东西，然而奇怪的是，写这些东西时，他脑子里清清楚楚记起了另外一件事，以至于他几乎也想把它写下来。他意识到就是因为这另外一件事，让他突然决定回到家里并从这天起开始记日记。

如果那样模糊的一件事也能称为发生过，那么它是发生在那天上午，在部里。

当时快到十一点，在温斯顿所在的档案司，人们开始从小隔间里往外拉椅子，摆在大厅中间，正对着大电屏，是为两分钟仇恨会做准备。温斯顿正要在中间一排某个位置就座，有两个他只是面熟但从未说过话的人出乎意料地来了。其中一位是个女孩，他经常在走廊里跟她擦肩而过。他不知道她的名字，只知道她在小说司工作，可能——因为她有时两手都沾着油，还拿了个扳手——她负责某部长篇小说写作机的机械维修工作。她是个样子大胆的女孩，看上去二十七岁左右，长着一头浓密的黑发，脸上有雀斑，动作像运动员那样敏捷。一条窄窄的鲜红色饰带——那是青少年反性同盟成员的标志——在她工作服的腰带上缠了几圈，松紧程度刚好能显现出她臀部的优美线条。从第一次看到她的那刻起，温斯顿就讨厌她，他也知道是什么原因：因为她随时随地制造的那种代表着曲棍球场、冷水浴、集体远足和完全心无杂念的氛围。他几乎讨厌所有女人，特别是年轻貌美的。女人——特别是所有的年轻女人——总是党的最死心塌地的信徒、轻信宣传口号的人、业余侦探和异端思想的包打听。但这个女孩给了他一种印象，就是她比绝大多数女人更危险。有一次，他们在走廊里擦肩而过时，她乜斜着迅速瞄了他一眼，那好像刺进他体内，并注入一种黑色的恐惧感。他脑子里甚至想到，她有可能是思想警察的特务，不过事实上，这种机会微乎其微，但每次只要她在附近，仍会让他感觉特别不自在，这种感觉混合了敌意，还有恐惧。

另外一位是个男的，名叫奥布兰，是名内党党员。他的职务重要而不可测，温斯顿对其性质只是略有感觉而已。看到一名身穿黑色工作服的内党党员走过来时，椅子周围的这群人中出现了片刻的肃静。奥布兰的块头很大，很结实，脖子很粗，面容粗糙、幽默而又冷酷。虽然外表让人望而生畏，但他的举止有一定的魅力。他有一招，就是推一推架在鼻子上的眼镜，这个动作很奇怪，能让人解除戒心——说不上为什么，但是奇怪地给人以文质彬彬的感觉。如果还有人这样想的话，这个动作也许能让人想起一位十八世纪的贵族在邀请别人用他的鼻烟。十几年时间里，温斯顿见到奥布兰的次数可能差不多也就是十几次。他感到奥布兰对他而言很有吸引力，不仅因为后者温文尔雅的举止与职业拳击手般块头的反差让他觉得很有趣，更重要的，是因为他有个秘密信念——也许根本不是信念，而是一丝希望，即奥布兰在政治正统性方面并非完美无暇，他的表情无疑说明了这一点。话又说回来，也许他脸上表现出的根本不是非正统性，只不过是智慧。但不管怎样，从外表上看，他是那种可以跟他谈谈心的人，如果有办法躲过电屏跟他单独在一起的话。温斯顿从未付出一点努力去证实这种猜测，确实，也没办法证实。那时，奥布兰看了一眼手表，看到马上快十一点了，显然决定留在档案司，直到两分钟仇恨会结束。他跟温斯顿坐在同一排，中间隔了几张椅子，一个黄红色头发的矮个女人坐在他们中间，她在温斯顿隔壁的小隔间工作。那个黑头发女孩正好坐在温斯顿身后。

这时，大厅那头的电屏里突然传出一阵令人难受的刺耳讲话声，如同一台巨大的机器在缺少润滑油的情况下运作时发出的声音，这种声音能让人咬牙切齿、义愤填膺。仇恨会开始了。

照例，伊曼纽尔·戈斯坦因——这个人民公敌的面孔闪现在电屏上，观众发出此起彼伏的鄙夷之声，黄红色头发的矮个女人带着恐惧和厌恶发出一声尖叫。戈斯坦因是叛徒和蜕变者，很久以前（谁也记不清有多久）是党的主要领导人之一，几乎跟老大哥平起平坐，后来参加了反革命活动，被判处死刑，然而又神秘地逃跑并藏匿起来。两分钟仇恨会的进程每天都不一样，但无一例外，每次都以戈斯坦因为主角。他是头号卖国贼，是最早破坏党的纯洁的人，所有后来对党所犯的罪行、变节、破坏活动、异端邪说以及越轨行为都直接出自他的煽动。在某个地方，他仍活在人世并策划着阴谋：也许在大洋彼岸，在豢养他的外国主子保护之下，也许甚至——时不时会传出这种谣言——就潜伏在大洋国本国的某处。

温斯顿感觉胸口发闷。每次看到戈斯坦因的面孔，他都会有百感交集的痛苦感觉。这是一张瘦削的犹太人面孔，头顶有一圈浓密的白头发，毛茸茸的，下巴上蓄着一小撮山羊须——这是一张聪明人的面孔，但不知为何，从本质上觉得可鄙。靠近他又细又长的鼻尖地方，架着一副眼镜，给人一种年迈昏庸的感觉。这张脸类似一张绵羊的脸，就连声音也像绵羊。戈斯坦因在一如既往地恶毒攻击党的各种教义——这种攻击夸张而荒谬，连小孩子都能看穿，但又刚好貌似有理得会让人警惕，即其他人，头脑没那么清醒的人有可能上当受骗。戈斯坦因侮辱老大哥，谴责党的独裁，要求马上与欧亚国和谈，他鼓吹言论自由、出版自由、集会自由、思想自由，他歇斯底里地叫嚣革命已被背叛——全是以快速和多音节的方式讲出来，是对党的演讲家那种惯常风格的拙劣模仿，甚至也包含新话——没错，比任何党员在日常生活中通常使用的新话还要多。而且自始至终，为避免人们可能对戈斯坦因那貌似有理、哗众取宠的讲话所掩盖的事实有所怀疑，电屏上他的脑袋后面，有无数排着纵队的欧亚国军队在前进——那是一排又一排长得很壮实的人，有着面无表情的亚洲人面孔。他们涌现到电屏上，然后消失，被代之以其他长相完全类似的军人。单调而有节奏的沉重军靴声成了戈斯坦因那咩咩叫声的背景。

仇恨会进行了还不到半分钟，房间里有一半人发出了不可遏制的怒吼。那张自鸣得意、绵羊脸一般的面孔以及这张面孔后面欧亚国军队可怕的力量令人无法忍受，再者，看到或甚至想到戈斯坦因，就能让人们不由得感到恐惧和愤怒。他比欧亚国或东亚国更经常成为仇恨对象，因为大洋国跟这两大国其一进行战争时，一般跟另一大国处于和平关系。然而奇怪的是，尽管戈斯坦因被所有人仇恨、鄙视，尽管一年三百六十五天，他的理论每天上千次在讲台、电屏、报纸、书本上被批驳、粉碎、嘲笑，被一般人认为是可鄙的垃圾，然而这一切似乎从来没能让他的影响降低过，总会有一些新的上当受骗者在等着被他诱惑，每天都有奉其指令的间谍和破坏分子被思想警察挖出来。他是一支巨大的影子部队的司令，那是由力图颠覆国家的搞阴谋者所组成的地下网络，这个网络的名称据说叫兄弟会。另外，还有一些悄悄流传的说法，关于一本可怕的书本，它汇集各种异端邪说，戈斯坦因所写。这本书到处秘密流传，没有名字，人们在不得已提到它时，简单称之为“那本书”。不过人们都是通过不清不楚的谣言得知这些事情，凡是一般党员，都会尽量避免谈及兄弟会和“那本书”。

进入第二分钟，仇恨会达到了狂热状态。人们在座位上跳上跳下，用最大的嗓门叫喊着，想盖过电屏里传来的发狂的咩咩叫声音。黄红色头发的矮个女人脸色通红，嘴巴一张一合，像条离水的鱼。就连奥布兰那张严肃的脸庞也胀红了。他在椅子上坐得笔直，他那健硕的胸膛气鼓鼓的，还在颤抖，似乎正在忍受波浪的冲击。温斯顿后面那个黑头发女孩开始喊“猪猡！猪猡！猪猡！”。突然，她捡起一本厚厚的新话词典掷向电屏，打中戈斯坦因的鼻子反弹回来，但那个声音仍然无情地响着。很快，温斯顿发现自己在和别人一起呼喊，用脚后跟猛踢所坐椅子的横档板。两分钟仇恨会的最可怕之处，并非你被迫参与其中，恰恰相反，避免参与才不可能。过上二十秒，任何装扮总变得毫无必要。一种出于恐惧和报复心理的可怕情绪，一种去杀戮、拷打、用大锤去砸人脸的渴望像电流般通过整个人群，将一个人甚至是违背其意愿地变成面容扭曲、尖叫不止的疯子。但他们感到的那种愤怒是种抽象而盲目的感情，因此有那么一阵子，温斯顿的仇恨根本没转向戈斯坦因，恰恰相反，而是向着老大哥、党和思想警察。那一刻，他的心偏向电屏上那个孤独的、被嘲笑的异端分子，他是在充满谎言的世界上真理与理智的唯一守护者。然而就在接下来的一刻，他跟周围的人站到了一起，对他来说，他们所说的关于戈斯坦因的一切全都属实。那些时候，他对老大哥私下的厌恶变成了崇拜，而老大哥好像高高屹立，是所向无敌、无所畏惧的保护者，岩石般矗立着，对抗亚洲的群氓。而戈斯坦因，尽管他孤立无援，甚至他本人是否存在都尚存疑问，但他仍像个阴险的巫师，仅仅凭借话语的力量，就能将文明的架构摧毁。

有时，甚至有可能故意为之地将个人的仇恨目标转来转去。突然，就像在恶梦中猛然用力把头从枕头上扭到另一边，温斯顿成功地将对电屏上那张面孔的仇恨转移到他身后那个黑发女孩身上。他的脑海里出现了生动的幻觉：他会用胶皮警棍把她殴打至死，会把她脱光衣服绑到一根木桩上，然后向她射满一身的箭，正如那些人对圣塞巴斯蒂安所做的(2)；他会强奸她，然后在高潮之际割断她的喉咙。另外，他也比以前更清楚地意识到自己为什么会恨她。他恨她，是因为她年轻漂亮却毫不性感，因为他想和她上床却永远无法做到，因为她可爱的柔软腰部——像是在请人去搂——围着的却只是一条可恶的鲜红色饰带，那是代表贞洁的咄咄逼人的标志。

仇恨会达到了高潮。戈斯坦因的声音变成真正绵羊的咩咩叫声，有那么一阵子，那张脸也变成了绵羊脸。接着绵羊脸渐隐于一个似乎在冲锋的欧亚国士兵形象之上，他身躯巨大，面目凶恶，手里的冲锋枪在吼叫着，整个人似乎要从电屏里跳将出来，以至于前排有几个人真的在座位上往后缩。然而正当此时，每个人都如释重负地呼了一口气，敌军形象隐没在老大哥的面孔里，黑头发，黑色八字胡，充满力量和神秘的安详感，它大得几乎占据了整张屏幕。谁都没听到老大哥说什么，无非是几句鼓励士气的话，这种话在一片嘈杂中说出来，人们听不清都说了什么，然而仅仅说出这些话，就能恢复他们的信心。然后老大哥的面孔又渐渐隐去，党的三条标语以醒目的大写字母出现了：



战争即和平

自由即奴役

无知即力量



但老大哥的面孔似乎在电屏上又持续出现了几秒钟，似乎对每个人的眼球造成的冲击过于强烈，不能马上消失。黄红色头发的矮个女人扑在她前面的椅子靠背上，双手向电屏张开，嘴里还咕咕哝哝地颤声说些什么，听来似乎是“我的大救星啊！”。接着，她用手捂住脸，显然在祈祷。

就在此时，整群人发出了低沉缓慢而又有节奏的呼喊：“B—B(3)！……B—B！”一遍又一遍，非常缓慢，两个“B”中间有久久的停顿，不知为何，那奇怪得有点野蛮的味道。在如此背景声中，似乎能听到赤脚跺地和手鼓的咚咚响声。在大概有半分钟的时间里，他们一直这样呼喊着。这是种情绪极其强烈时经常能听到的压抑声音，一定程度上说，它类似对老大哥的智慧和威严的颂歌，然而更重要的是，这是种自我催眠行为，是制造有节奏的噪音以失去知觉的故意行为。温斯顿似乎感到五内俱寒。两分钟仇恨会时，他无法控制住自己不和大家一起疯狂，但这种不似正常人所发出的“B—B！……B—B！”呼喊声总让他十分惊骇。当然，他也跟别人一起呼喊，不这样不可能。掩盖自己的感觉，控制自己的表情，做别人在做的事，这些都属本能反应。然而有那么一两秒钟，他的眼神有可能泄露了感情，这可想而知。正好就在那一刻，那件具有重要意义的事情发生了——如果说它的确发生过。

就在那时，他和奥布兰四目相望。奥布兰已经站起身，刚才他把眼镜取了下来，那时正以他特有的动作戴眼镜，然而就在他们四目相望的不到一秒钟时间里，温斯顿就在那一刻知道了——对，他知道了！他知道奥布兰在跟他想着同样的事。一个确凿无误的信息已经传递过来，似乎两人的大脑都打开着，通过眼睛，思想从一个人的大脑流入另一个人的。“我跟你一样，”奥布兰似乎在对他说，“我完全了解你的感受。你的蔑视，你的仇恨，你的嫌恶，我全知道。不过别担心，我站在你这边！”接着那心领神会的片刻转瞬即逝，奥布兰的脸色变得和别人的一样，不可测知。

全部经过就是这样，可是他已经开始对这件事是否发生过没把握。这种事情永远没有后续，所起的全部作用，不过让他在内心保持一种信念或希望，即除了他自己，还有别的人也与党为敌。也许关于大规模地下串联活动的谣言说到底确有其事——也许兄弟会真的存在！虽然总有没完没了的逮捕、招供和处决，但要想确定兄弟会实有其事仍属不可能，有时他信其有，有时他信其无。没有证据，只有星星点点之事，可能其中有文章，也可能没有什么意思：无意听到的谈话片断，厕所墙上语焉不详的涂鸦，可能被当做接头信号的一个不起眼的手势。全是臆测而已，很可能一切都是他的想象。他回到他的小隔间，没有再看到奥布兰，他几乎从未再想要延续他们那一瞬间的接触，即使他知道怎样进行，也会危险之至。他们含含糊糊地对望一眼，只有一秒钟或者两秒钟，全部经过如此而已。但纵然如此，在一个人不得不在其中生活的与世隔绝的孤寂中，那也值得铭记。

温斯顿把身子坐直了一些。他打了个嗝，酒从胃里泛了上来。

他又定睛看那张纸，发现在无助沉思的同时，他也在写字，像是种自动行为，而且写得也不像刚才那样歪歪斜斜、难以辨认。他的钢笔在光滑的纸上写下了漂亮的印刷体大字，字母全大写：



打倒老大哥

打倒老大哥

打倒老大哥

打倒老大哥

打倒老大哥



一遍又一遍，写满了半张纸。

他无法不感到一阵恐慌，这没道理，因为写下那些字和开始记日记比起来，并非更危险，可是有那么一阵子，他想撕掉写了字的那几页，彻底放弃写日记这一险举。

但他没这样做，因为他知道没用，不管他是写下了“打倒老大哥”还是忍着没写，不管他是继续写日记还是停止写，都没有区别，思想警察一样会抓到他。他已经犯下了——即便他从未写到纸上，他仍是犯下了——包括其他一切罪行的基本罪行，他们称之为思想罪。思想罪是无法永远掩盖的，你可以成功地躲过一时甚至几年，但他们仍然注定会抓到你，迟早而已。

总是在夜里——逮捕无一例外在夜里执行。睡觉时突然被惊醒，粗暴的手摇晃着你的肩膀，电筒照着你的两眼，一圈冷峻的面孔出现在床周围。绝大多数情况下，没有审讯，没有关于逮捕的报道，人们只是失踪了，总是发生在夜里。你的名字被注销，你做过的一切事情的记录都被清除，不承认你一度存在过，然后就被遗忘。你被铲除了，消灭了——人们通常用的词是“被蒸发”。

有一阵子，他陷入一种歇斯底里的情绪，开始潦草地写道：



他们会枪毙我我无所谓他们会从我的脖子背后开枪我无所谓打倒老大哥他们总是从你的脖子后面开枪我无所谓打倒老大哥——



他又往后靠着坐在椅子上，有点为自己感到惭愧，然后放下钢笔。这时候他猛然一惊：有人敲了一下门。

这就来了！他像个耗子一样坐着一动不动，徒劳地希望不管那是谁，就让他试着敲下门就走吧。然而没有，敲门声还在继续。最坏的做法便是拖延。他的心脏像鼓一样敲着，不过他脸上很可能没有表情，长期习惯使然。他站起身，脚步沉重地走向房门。

第二章


抓到门把手时，温斯顿看到自己把日记摊开放在桌子上，上面写的全是“打倒老大哥”，字体之大，几乎从房间这头望去也能认出。这件事做得蠢不可及，但他意识到那是因为就算在最仓皇失措的时刻，他仍不想在墨迹未干时合上本子，以致弄脏那细腻的纸张。

他吸了口气打开房门，心头马上荡漾着如释重负的暖意。站在门外的，是个颜色苍白、萎靡不振的女人，头发稀疏，脸上满是皱纹。

“噢，同志，”她用一种悲切切的疲惫声音说，“我就觉着听到您进房间了，您能不能过来看看我家厨房的水池？塞住了，还——”

那是帕森斯太太，是同一层楼一个邻居的妻子。（党多少反对用“太太”这个词，应该称每个人为“同志”，但人们还是会不由自主对某些女人使用这个词。）她是个三十岁上下的女人，样子却老得多，她给人一种印象是她脸上的皱纹里藏有灰尘。温斯顿跟随她顺过道走过去。这种业余维修工作几乎成了每天必做的烦心事。胜利大厦是幢老公寓楼，建于一九三零年左右，正处于摇摇欲垮的状态。天花板和墙壁上的灰泥经常剥落，每逢严寒，水管都会爆裂，一下雪，屋顶就会漏水。供暖系统如果不是为了节约而完全关掉，一般只开一半蒸汽量。维修的事除非自己动手，否则需要经过某个高高在上的委员会批准，然而就连换块窗玻璃这种事，该委员会都很可能甚至拖上两年才批准。

“当然是因为汤姆不在家。”帕森斯太太含含糊糊地说。

帕森斯家的公寓比温斯顿住的要大一些，是另一种方式的肮脏。什么东西都有种被击打和践踏过的样子，似乎刚有一头凶猛的动物造访过。体育用品——曲棍球棒，拳击手套，一个踢爆了的足球，一条翻过来的有汗味的短裤——全放在地板上，桌子上还有一堆脏碟子和折了角的练习薄。墙上是几面青年团和侦察队的鲜红旗帜，还有张老大哥的全幅宣传画。那里跟整幢楼一样，有股常有的煮卷心菜气味，但还是掩不住一股更为浓烈的汗臭味，那汗味——这一闻可知，只是难以说明白怎么会那样——来自另外一个当时不在场的人。另一个房间里，有谁在用梳子和一片草纸吹着，想跟电屏里仍在播放的军乐声合上拍。

“是孩子们，”帕森斯太太说着有点忧虑地往门口看了一眼，“他们今天没出去，当然——”

她有个习惯，就是话只说一半。厨房水池里发绿的脏水满得几乎要溢出来，气味比煮卷心菜味还要难闻许多。温斯顿跪下来查看水管的曲颈接口。他很不愿意动手干这种活，也很不愿意弯下身子，那样总能让他咳嗽起来。帕森斯太太帮不上忙，在旁边看着他。

“当然，汤姆在家的话，他一会儿就能弄好。”她说，“他喜欢干这个，他的手总是很巧，汤姆真的是。”

帕森斯是温斯顿在真理部的同事，他长得有点胖，是个蠢不可及的活跃分子，一腔弱智的热情——是那种完全听话、忠心耿耿、乏味无趣的人，党的稳固统治对这种人的依赖有甚于对思想警察。他三十五岁，前不久才很不情愿地被青年团赶出来，而早在升上青年团之前，他在规定年龄已满后仍赖在侦察队多待了一年。他在部里担任某个次要职务，智力方面无要求，但另一方面，在体育委员会和别的负责组织集体远足、自发游行、节约运动和义务劳动的委员会里，他可是个重要人物。抽烟斗的间隙，他会语气平静然而自豪地告诉你，过去四年里，他每晚必到集体活动中心。他走到哪儿，就把一股强烈的汗味带到哪儿——那可以说无意成了他在生活中精力充沛的佐证——甚至在他走后仍弥留不去。

“你们家有没有扳手？”温斯顿问道，一面在摸索曲颈接口的螺帽。

“扳手，”帕森斯太太说着马上变得有气无力，“我不知道，说不准。也许孩子们——”

随着一阵噔噔的靴子响和又一声吹梳子的声音，孩子们冲进起居室。帕森斯太太拿来了扳手。温斯顿把水放掉，忍着作呕取出一团堵塞了水管的头发。他用水龙头的冷水尽量把手指洗干净，然后回到了另一个房间。

“举起手来！”一个气势汹汹的声音大叫道。

一个漂亮却面目冷酷的九岁男孩从桌子后面跳出来，手持一把玩具自动手枪向温斯顿比画着，比他小两岁左右的妹妹也拿一块木头做着同样的动作。他们两个都穿着蓝短裤、灰衬衫，戴着红领巾，那是侦察队的制服。温斯顿把手举过头顶，然而心里有种不安的感觉，男孩的动作是如此恶狠狠的样子，感觉不完全是闹着玩。

“你这个卖国贼！”男孩大叫道，“你这个思想犯！你这个欧亚国的间谍！我要毙了你！我要蒸发你！我要把你送到盐场去！”

突然，他们两个开始围着他跳跃，嘴里还喊着“卖国贼”和“思想犯”。小女孩的一招一式都在模仿她哥哥。他们就像不久便会长成食人兽的老虎崽子一样嬉戏着，不知怎么，那有点令人恐惧。男孩的眼里，有种狡猾而残忍的神色。另外很显然，他想对温斯顿又踢又打，而且也意识到自己很快就到能做这种事的年龄。幸好他手里握的不是一支真正的手枪，温斯顿这样想。

帕森斯太太的眼睛不安地在温斯顿和自己的孩子之间扫来扫去。在起居室较亮的光线下，他注意到她脸上的皱纹里真的有灰尘，觉得颇有趣。

“他们闹得真厉害，”她说，“因为不能去看绞刑，所以不高兴，就是为了这件事。我忙得没时间带他们去，汤姆又不能按时下班回家。”

“为什么我们不能去看绞刑？”男孩用他的特大嗓门嚷嚷。

“我要看绞刑！我要看绞刑！”小女孩还在蹦来跳去地喊。

温斯顿想起来了，有几个欧亚国的俘虏因为犯了战争罪，将于这天晚上在公园被处以绞刑。这种事情每月进行一次，是大家都想一睹的盛事，小孩子总闹着要大人带他们去看。他向帕森斯太太告了别就往门口走去，但在过道上还没走几步，就有什么东西打中他的脖根，打得他疼痛难忍，好像有根烧得通红的铁丝戳了进去。他一转身，刚好看到帕森斯太太拉着儿子进了房门，男孩正往口袋里装起一把弹弓。

“戈斯坦因！”男孩被关进门时吼了一嗓子，然而让温斯顿印象最深的，是那个女人颜色发灰的脸上那种无助而惊骇的神情。

回到自己的公寓后，他快步走过电屏又坐在那张桌子面前，手还在揉脖子。电屏已经停止播放音乐。一个吐字清晰、代表军方的声音正以狂喜的语气描述新浮动堡垒的武器装备，该堡垒不久前在冰岛和法罗群岛之间的地方下锚。

他想，养那样的孩子，那个可怜的女人过的一定是提心吊胆的生活。再过一两年，他们会日夜监视她，以图发现任何异端思想的征兆。如今，几乎所有孩子都是可怕的。最糟糕的是通过侦察队这种组织，他们被系统化改造成无法管教的小野人，但又不会在他们身上产生对党的纪律的反抗倾向。恰恰相反，他们崇拜党以及与党有关的一切。唱歌，列队前进，打旗帜，远足，拿木头步枪操练，呼口号，崇拜老大哥——对他们来说，都属于光荣之事。他们所有的残暴都是对外的，针对国家的敌人、外国人、叛国者、破坏分子、思想犯等。年过三十的人会害怕自己的孩子，这几乎已经变成一种普遍现象。很合理的是，《泰晤士报》几乎每星期都会登出一篇文章，关于某个偷听别人说话的小告密者——一般用的是“小英雄”这个词——如何无意听到父母的某句不敬言论，然后去思想警察那里告发他们的事迹。

弹弓子造成的刺痛逐渐消退了。他心不在焉地拿起钢笔，拿不准他还能不能想到更多事可以写下来。突然，他又想起了奥布兰。

几年前——有多久？一定有七年了——他梦到他正在穿过一个漆黑的房间，有个坐在他一侧的人在他走过时说：“我们会在没有黑暗的地方见面。”说这句话的语气很平静，几乎是家常的，是个陈述句，不是命令。他没有停下脚步，而是继续走着。奇怪的是当时，在梦里，这句话并未给他留下什么印象，只是到后来，那句话似乎逐渐具有了意义。他现在记不清楚他第一次见到奥布兰是在做那个梦之前还是之后，也不记得他什么时候第一次辨认出那是奥布兰的声音。但是不管怎样，他的确辨认出来了，在黑暗中跟他说话的是奥布兰。

温斯顿从来没有把握——甚至在这天上午看到他的眼神一闪之后，仍然无法确定奥布兰是朋友还是敌人。但这似乎没有太大关系，他们中间有条理解的纽带，比友爱或党派之情更重要。“我们会在没有黑暗的地方见面。”他这样说过了，温斯顿不知道那是什么意思，只知道它会以某种方式实现。

电屏里的说话声暂停，一阵嘹亮悦耳的小号声回荡在不流通的空气中，然后说话声又刺耳地响起：

“注意！请注意！现在插播从马拉巴尔(1)前线收到的新闻。我们在印度南部的部队取得了一场辉煌的胜利。我受权宣布，我们报道的此次战役将大大推动战争向结束的方向发展。这是新闻插播——”

坏消息来了，温斯顿想。果不其然，在播报完一段描述如何骇人听闻地消灭一支欧亚国军队以及毙敌、俘敌的惊人数字之后，通告就来了，从下星期开始，巧克力的定量将从每天三十克降到二十克。

温斯顿又打了个嗝。酒劲正在过去，留下一种泄气的感觉。电屏里——或许为了庆祝胜利，或许为了淹没关于失去的巧克力的记忆——雄壮地奏响了《为了你，大洋国》。按说这种时候要立正，但在他目前所处位置，电屏看不到他。

《为了你，大洋国》之后是轻松一点的音乐。温斯顿走到窗前，保持背对电屏。天气仍然又冷又晴。远方某处，一颗火箭弹爆炸了，回荡起沉闷的轰鸣声。目前，伦敦每星期要挨上二三十颗火箭弹。

在下面的街上，风把破角的宣传画吹得啪啪响，“英社”一词正好时而出现，时而遮住。英社。英社的神圣原则。新话，双重思想，过去的易变性。他感觉似乎自己正在海底森林中漫步，迷失在一个怪异的世界里，在其中，他就是怪物。他是孑然一身。过去已然死去，未来不可想象。他又怎能肯定某个活着的人是跟他站在一起的？又如何能知道党的统治不会千秋万代？像是作为回答，真理部大楼白色前墙上党的三条标语又映入他的眼帘：



战争即和平

自由即奴役

无知即力量



他从口袋里掏出一枚二角五分钱的硬币，上面以小而清晰的字母压铸着同样的标语。硬币的另一面是老大哥的头像，即使在硬币上，那双眼睛也紧盯着你。硬币上，邮票上，书本封面上，旗帜上，还有烟盒包装上——无所不在，总是那双眼睛在盯着你，还有那声音在包围着你。不管睡觉还是醒着，工作还是吃饭，室内还是室外，洗澡还是在床上——无处可逃。除了头颅之内的几立方厘米，一切都不属于你自己。

太阳转过去了，真理部的无数窗户因为没有光线照耀而显得可怕，如同一座堡垒上的射击孔。在这座巨大的金字塔形状的建筑前，他感到恐惧。它太坚固了，它无法被攻占，一千颗火箭弹也炸不掉它。他又琢磨起他是在为谁而写日记。为了未来，为了过去——为了一个可能是子虚乌有的时代。等待在他面前的不是死亡，而是毁灭。日记将被烧成灰，他自己也将被蒸发掉。只有思想警察会读到他所写的东西，然后他们会把它销毁，接着又从记忆中把它清除。当你的一切痕迹，甚至是不具名地在纸上划拉下的字迹都不可能实际存在时，你又怎能向未来呼吁？

电屏里响了十四下钟声，他必须在十分钟内离开，他一定要在十四点三十分前赶回去工作。

奇怪的是，报时钟声似乎让他换了种心情。他是个孤独的幽灵，正在讲述一个谁都不会听的真理，然而只要他说出来，那种连贯性就以某种不明显的方式保持下来。不是通过让别人听到你的话，而是通过保持清醒，将人性传统延续下去。他回到桌前，用笔蘸了墨水写道：



致未来或过去，致思想是自由的、人们相互各异而且并非孤独生活着的时代——致事实存在不变、发生过就不会被清除的时代：

从一个千篇一律的时代，从一个孤独的时代，从老大哥的时代，从双重思想的时代——向您致意！



他已经死了，他沉思道。对他来说，好像只是现在，在开始能把自己的想法系统化时，他才迈出了决定性一步。每个行动的结果都包含在行动本身。他写道：



思想罪并不导致死亡：思想罪就是死亡。



现在他既然已经自认是个死人，保持尽量久地活着就变得重要了。他右手有两个指头沾上了墨水，一点没错，这就是可能暴露自己行为的细节。部里某个爱打听的狂热分子（很可能是个女人，像那位黄红色头发的矮个子女人或是小说司里那个黑头发女孩的某个女人）也许会琢磨他为什么在午餐休息时间写东西，为什么要使用一杆老式钢笔，在写什么——然后向有关部门暗示一下这件事。他到厕所里小心翼翼地用粗砂般的黑褐色肥皂擦洗干净，这种肥皂能像砂纸一样打磨你的皮肤，用来洗掉墨迹倒挺合用。

他把日记放进抽屉，要想藏起它纯属徒劳，但他至少可以确认是否已被发现有这么一本日记。夹根头发就太明显了，他用指尖夹起一粒能辨认出的白色灰尘放在封面一角，有人动这个本子的话，它肯定会被抖掉。

第三章


温斯顿梦到了他的母亲。

他想，母亲失踪时，他肯定有十或十一岁了。她身材高大，姿态端庄，宛如雕像，说话很少，动作缓慢，一头漂亮的金发。对父亲，他的记忆更模糊，只记得他又黑又瘦，总穿着整洁的深颜色衣服（温斯顿特别记得他父亲的鞋子鞋底很薄），戴眼镜。显然，他们两人一定是被五十年代最早几次大清洗中的某一次所吞噬。

梦中此时，他的母亲正坐在距他下面很深的某个地方，怀里抱着他的妹妹，他根本不记得妹妹，只记得她是个长得很小、身体虚弱的小孩，总是不出声，长了双警觉的大眼睛。她们两人都抬头看着他，她们是在地下的某个地方，例如说井底或者很深的墓穴里——然而是那种虽然已经在他下面很深，却仍在往下坠落的地方。她们在一艘正在下沉的船上的大厅里面，在透过颜色逐渐变深的水看着他。大厅里仍有空气，她们能看到他，他也能看到她们，但她们仍一直往下沉，往绿色的深处沉去。再过一会儿，绿色的水定会让她们永远消失。他在有光有空气的地方，她们正被死亡吸噬，而她们之所以在那里，是因为他在上面。他明白这一点，她们也明白，他也能从她们的脸上看出她们明白这一点。无论脸上还是心里，她们都毫无责备之意，只是明白她们必须死，以使他可以继续活下去，这也是事情发展过程中不可避免的。

他不记得发生了什么事，然而他在梦中明白，从某种意义上说，他母亲和妹妹的生命是为了他而牺牲的。有一种梦在保留典型梦境的同时，人的思维活动仍继续进行，梦里会意识到一些事实及想法，醒后觉得那些事实及想法似乎依然新颖而且珍贵，这个梦就是如此。这时，温斯顿突然想到，他母亲在差不多三十年前的死是悲剧，令人悲痛，如今已属不可能。他认识到悲剧只属于遥远的旧时代，在那个时代，仍然存在隐私权、爱和友谊，家庭成员互相扶持，不需要知道为什么。想起母亲令他心如刀绞，因为她至死都爱他，而他当时年龄太小，太自私，不懂得以爱回报爱，而且不知何故——他不记得为什么——她将自己牺牲于一个忠诚的概念，那种忠诚属于个人，不可改变。他意识到这类事情不可能发生在今天，今天有恐惧、仇恨和痛苦，但情感失去了高尚性，不再有有深度或者复杂的悲哀。所有这些，他好像都从他母亲和妹妹那睁大的眼晴里看出来了，那两双眼睛在透过绿色的水看着他，在几百英寻以下，而且还在往下沉。

突然，他站在草短而且富有弹性的草地上，是在一个夏日的傍晚，斜晖将这片土地镀了金。他正看着的那片风景经常出现在他的梦境中，以至于他从来拿不准是否在现实世界上看到过。醒后回想时，他称之为黄金乡。那是个被野兔啃咬的老草场，一条步行小径蜿蜒穿过，鼹鼠丘处处可见。在草场对面参差不齐的树篱那边，榆树枝在和风中极其轻微地晃动，树叶只是抖动着，很厚实的一大团一大团，像女人的秀发。在近在咫尺的某处，虽然看不见，但有条缓缓流动的清澈溪流。那里，在柳树下方，鲮鱼在池塘里游着。

那个黑头发女孩穿过草场向那几棵柳树走去，似乎是仅仅手一动，就脱下衣服并高傲地扔到一旁。她的躯体洁白光滑，然而丝毫未能引起他的欲望，他确实几乎没看她。那一刻，他心里最强烈的感情，是对她把衣服扔到一旁这一动作的钦佩之情。这个动作优雅而随便，好像摧毁了整整一种文化和思想体系，似乎单是手臂的一个漂亮无比的动作，就能横扫老大哥、党和思想警察于无形。同样，那个动作也属于遥远的旧时代。温斯顿醒来时，嘴里还在念叨“莎士比亚”。

电屏发出一声刺破耳膜的哨音，并以同一调子持续了半分钟。那时是七点十五分，是办公室工作人员的起床时间。温斯顿挣扎着起了床——他光着身子，因为一个外党党员每年只有三千张配给券，一套睡衣就需要六百张——抓起搭在椅子上的一件肮脏的背心和一条短裤。三分钟后是体操时间。就在此时，他因为一阵猛烈的咳嗽而弯下身子，几乎每天起床后，他都要这么咳上一阵子。咳嗽完全清空了他的肺部，以致他需要仰面躺下并喘半天气后才能正常呼吸。他的静脉因为咳嗽用力而胀粗，静脉曲张溃疡处又痒起来。

“三十到四十组！”一个刺耳的女人声音像狗叫一样，“三十到四十组！请站好位置！三十到四十组！”

温斯顿一跃而起，在电屏前立正站好。电屏上已经现出一个年轻女人的图像，尽管很瘦，却肌肉发达，穿的是束腰外衣和帆布运动鞋。

“伸屈胳膊！”她厉声喊道，“一起跟我来。一，二，三，四！一，二，三，四！快点，同志们。拿出点儿精神！一，二，三，四！一，二，三，四！……”

咳嗽发作时造成的痛苦没能将梦境留下的印象消除干净，做操时的节奏运动又多少把那个印象恢复了一点。他把胳膊机械地挥前挥后，脸上挂着十分快乐的表情——这种表情被认为是做体操时合适的表情——的时候，他尽力回想早期童年那段模糊时期。非常困难，五十年代后期再往前的一切记忆都淡化了。当可资参考的外部档案不复存在，甚至你自己的生活都不再清晰时，你所记得的惊天动地的大事很可能根本从未发生过，你记得事情的细节，却无法重温那种气氛，还存在一些很长的空白期，根本不记得其间发生过何事。那时候的一切都不一样，甚至国家的名字以及在地图上的形状都跟现在不一样。例如，第一空域当时并不这么叫，而是叫英格兰或者不列颠。不过伦敦一直就叫伦敦，温斯顿对此很有把握。

温斯顿记不清楚什么时候他的国家不是处于战争状态，不过在他童年时，显然有过相当长一段和平时期，因为他的早期记忆片段之一是关于某次空袭的，它似乎让所有人措手不及，也许是原子弹炸了科尔彻斯特(1)那次。他不记得那次空袭本身，但记得父亲紧攥着他的手往下走啊走啊，走到一个在地下很深的地方，绕过一圈又一圈螺旋状楼梯，最后，他的腿累得让他呜呜哭了起来，他们只得停下来休息一下。他的母亲缓慢而精神恍惚地远远跟在后面，怀里抱着他的妹妹——也许那只是个装着毛毯的包袱，他不能肯定当时他妹妹是否已经出生。最后，他们到了一个人声嘈杂、拥挤不堪的地方，他意识到那是地铁站。

铺着石头的地板上坐满了人，另外有些人一个挨一个坐在铁制铺位上，是上下铺。温斯顿和父母在地板上找到一块地方，他们旁边是个老头儿和一个老太太，他们挨着坐在一个铺位上。那个老头儿穿了身质地不错的黑色套装，花白头发，头顶偏后的地方戴着一顶黑布帽子。他脸色通红，蓝色眼睛里噙着泪水。他浑身散发着浓烈的杜松子酒味，似乎他皮肤上冒的是酒而不是汗，也让人想象他眼里涌出的纯粹是酒。虽然他稍微有点醉了，但他同时还在为某件真实而无法忍受的事情伤心。温斯顿以他小孩子的理解方式，明白刚刚发生了一件可怕的事情，一件无法原谅、无法补救的事情。似乎对他来说，他也知道那是什么事：一个被老头儿爱着的人——也许是他的小孙女——被炸死了。每隔几分钟，那个老头儿都要重复说：

“我们不该信任他们，我不是说过了吗，孩子他妈，是不是？这就是信任他们的下场，我全说过了，我们不该信任那些混蛋。”

但温斯顿想不起来他们不该相信的，是哪些混蛋。

差不多从那时起，战争的确一直在持续，不过严格说来，它并非一直是同一场战争。在他的童年时代，伦敦就有过街头混战，持续好几个月，他对某些方面记得很清楚。然而要想描述那一段的整个历史，或是说出某个时间谁跟谁在打仗，则完全不可能，因为没有任何文字档案，也没有任何讲话里提到除了目前的盟国还有过别的盟国。例如当前，在一九八四年（如果这一年是一九八四年），大洋国在跟欧亚国打仗，跟东亚国结盟。无论在公开场合还是私下讲话里，从未有人承认三大国之间有过战争或者结盟的其他组合方式。事实上，温斯顿清清楚楚记得大洋国跟东亚国作战、跟欧亚国结盟只有四年时间。但这只是他碰巧暗中知道的事，这是因为他对自己记忆的控制并未达到要求。官方说法是从未发生过改换盟国的事，大洋国在跟欧亚国打仗——因此大洋国一直在跟欧亚国打仗，目前的敌国总代表着绝对的邪恶，因而过去或者未来与其达成任何协约都属不可能。

他把肩膀尽力往向仰时（手放在臀部，腰部以上躯体做旋转运动，这被认为对背部肌肉有好处），他第一万次地想到令人恐惧的是，这有可能全是真的。如果党能插手到过去，说这件事、那件事从未发生过——那不是肯定比单是拷打和死刑更可怕吗？

党说大洋国从未跟欧亚国结过盟，而他温斯顿知道短短四年前，大洋国是跟欧亚国结盟。但这种知识存在于何处？仅仅在他自己的意识里，而不管怎样，这种意识肯定不久将被消灭。如果其他所有人都接受了党强加的谎言——如果所有档案上都记录着同样的说法——那么谎言就进入历史并成为事实。“谁掌握历史，”党的标语这样说，“谁就掌握未来；谁掌握现在，谁就掌握历史。”但是过去——即使其性质可以被篡改——从来没被篡改过，现在什么是真实的，永远都真实。很简单，需要的只是不间断地一次次战胜自己的记忆。“现实控制”，这是他们的说法，在新话里叫“双重思想”。

“稍息！”女教练大声喊道，语气稍微和气了一点。

温斯顿把手垂到身边，缓慢地将肺部又吸满空气，他的大脑滑向一个双重思想的迷宫世界。知道又不知道；明白全部事实，却说着精心编造的谎言；同时拥有两种针锋相对的意见，一方面知道两者之间的矛盾，一方面又都信；利用逻辑来反逻辑；一方面批判道德，一方面又自认为有道德；相信不可能有民主，另一方面又相信党是民主的保卫者；忘掉一切需要忘记的，然后在需要记起时随时再回想起来，接着马上再忘掉——最重要的是，对这个过程本身，也要照此处理。最奥妙之处在此：要清醒地诱导自己进入不清醒状态，然后再次意识不到刚刚对自己实行的催眠行为。甚至理解“双重思想”这个词，也要用到双重思想。

女教练又叫他们立正。“现在看看我们中间谁能摸到脚趾！”她热情洋溢地说，“请把上身往下弯，同志们。一，二！一，二！……”

温斯顿很讨厌做这节练习，这让他从脚后跟到臀部一路剧痛上去，而且经常以咳嗽再次发作而结束。他原先在沉思时所感到的多少算是愉快的心情完全没有了。他想到过去岂止被篡改，实际上是被消灭了，原因在于，当除了自己的记忆别无任何档案存在时，你又怎能确定一件事情，即使它显而易见？他努力回忆他首次听说老大哥这个名字是在哪一年，觉得肯定是在六十年代的某一年，然而想确定究竟在哪一年则是不可能的。当然，在党史里，老大哥从革命最早期就是党的领袖和保卫者。他最早建立功勋的时间一直在被逐渐往前推，一直推到了令人难以置信的四十和三十年代，当时资本家仍然戴着奇特的圆筒形礼帽，乘坐锃亮的豪华汽车或者有玻璃拉窗的马车来回于伦敦街头。这种传说有几分属实、几分凭空杜撰不得而知。温斯顿甚至不记得党本身成立于哪一年，他不认为他在六十年代之前就听说过“英社”这个词，然而有可能它以旧话词形——即“英国社会主义”——在那之前就流行开来。一切都变得模糊不清，然而确实，有时候你能指出哪一则绝对是谎言。例如，在党的历史书上，声称是党发明了飞机，可是他记得很小时就有飞机了。但你什么都无法证明，从未有过任何证据。他一辈子里只有一次，他手里拿到过确凿无疑的文件证据，可以证明某件历史事实是伪造的。那一次——

“史密斯！”电屏里那个泼妇般的声音尖声喊道，“六零七九号史密斯·W！对，说你呢！请把身子弯低一点！你可以做得更好，你没努力！请弯低一点！那样就好点了，同志。现在全体注意，稍息，看着我。”

温斯顿一下子全身冒出一阵热汗。他保持着完全不可解读的表情，永远别表现得沮丧！永远别表现出憎恨！眼神的一闪，就可能暴露自己。他站在那里看着女教练把手举过头顶，然后——不能说是很优雅，但特别灵巧利索——弯下身子并把手指第一关节垫到了脚趾下面。

“嗨，同志们！这就是我希望看到你们能做的，再看我做一次。我三十九岁了，还生了四个孩子。看着我。”她又弯下身子，“你们看我的膝部没有弯曲，你们想的话都能做到，”她直起身子后又说，“凡是年龄四十五岁以下的人，都完全能摸到脚趾。我们并非每个人都有幸在前线打仗，但至少我们能做到保持身体健康。想想我们在马拉巴尔前线的小伙子！还有在水上堡垒的水兵吧！想想他们要忍受多少！现在再试一次。好点了，同志，好得多了。”她又对温斯顿鼓舞道，温斯顿这时把身子猛地往下一弯，两手成功地摸到了脚尖，膝部也没弯，这是几年来的第一次。

第四章


开始这天的工作时，温斯顿不由自主长叹一口气，即使距电屏那么近，也未能让他控制住。他把口述记录器拉近自己，吹去话筒上的灰尘，戴上眼镜，然后把办公桌右方的气力输送管里吹送来的四个纸卷展平别在一起。

小隔间的墙上有三个洞口。口述记录器右边是个小气力输送管，输送的是书面通知，左边大一点的送来的是报纸，在侧墙上伸手可及的地方还有个大的四方口，用铁丝网罩着，供处理废纸之用。这种口子在整幢大楼里有成千上万个，不止每个房间里都有，走廊上每隔一段距离也有。不知为何，这些洞的绰号是记忆洞。你明白某份文件应当被销毁时，甚至在看到一张躺在地上的纸片时，就会自动掀开最近一个记忆洞的盖子把它投进去，马上就会被一股暖空气卷走，卷到位于大楼某个隐秘地方的巨型炉子里。

温斯顿看了一下展开的纸条，每张上面都有一条只有一两句话的通知，以行话简写——并非真正的新话，然而包含大量新话词语——是部里内部使用的。这些通知是：



泰晤士报17.3.84bb讲话误报非洲改正

泰晤士报19.12.83预报三年计划四季度八十三处错印核实最新一期

泰晤士报14.2.84富部错报巧克力定量改正

泰晤士报3.12.83bb当日指示加加不好提到非人全面重写登档前提交



温斯顿略微有了种满足感，他把第四则通知放在一旁。那是件复杂且责任重大的工作，要留到最后做。另外三则都是一般性的，虽然第二则通知可能意味着要单调乏味地整理一大串数字。

温斯顿在电屏上拨了“过期”，要求送来相应那期《泰晤士报》，没过几分钟，它就从气力输送管里滑落出来。收到的通知跟文章或新闻有关，出于这样那样的原因被认为需要篡改，或者套用官方说法是需要修改。例如，从三月十七日的《泰晤士报》看来，老大哥在此前一天的讲话中，预言南印度前线将保持平静，欧亚国军队不久将在北非发动进攻。结果是欧亚国最高司令部在南亚发起进攻，而在北非没动作，因此需要将老大哥讲话里的那段重写，以使他的预言跟实际发生之事相吻合。又如，十二月十九日的《泰晤士报》上，发表了一篇对一九八三年第四季度——也就是第九个三年计划的第六个季度——各种消费品产量的官方预测。今天出版的这一期报纸上有实际产量的综述，可以看出预测在各方面显然都不对。温斯顿的工作是修改原来的数字，以使其跟后来的一致。至于第三条通知，所指的是个很简单的错误，可以在一两分钟内改好。距离现在很近的二月份，富足部许诺过（官方用语是“绝对保证”）一九八四年内不再削减巧克力定量。实际上正如温斯顿所知，这一星期过完，巧克力定量将从三十克降到二十克。需要做的，只是用一则警告代替原来的许诺，警告很可能需要在四月的某个时候降低定量。

温斯顿一处理完每则通知，就把口述记录器记下的更正纸条别在一起放进气力输送管。然后，他用尽量像是无意为之的动作，把原来的通知和他自己所写的草稿团一起扔进记忆洞，那将被火焰吞噬。

气力输送管通向的看不见的迷宫那里发生着什么，他并不清楚，但的确大体上知道。在把对某一期《泰晤士报》需要做的所有改正件集中到一起并做过比较后，那一期将被重印，原来那期则会被销毁，改正过的报纸被放回原来那期所在的档案。这种一刻不停的篡改步骤不仅用于报纸，还用于书籍、期刊、小册子、宣传画、传单、电影、录音、漫画、照片——就是可以想象到的每种具有政治或意识形态重要性的印刷品或文件。每一天——几乎也是每一分钟——过去被改动得跟现在一致。通过这种方式，党所做的每项预言都一贯正确，并有文件为证，凡是与目前需要相抵触的新闻或者发表的意见，都不允许在档案中存在。所有历史都是可以多次重新书写的本子，只要需要，随时可以擦干净重新书写。行为一旦完成，无论怎样都不可能证明发生过任何篡改之事。在档案司里人数最多的处里——其人数比温斯顿所在的处要多得多——那些人的唯一职责，就是追查并收回所有不合时宜因而需要被销毁的书籍、报纸和其他文件。因为政治结盟的变化或者老大哥的预言出错，有许多期《泰晤士报》可能已被篡改达十几次，但档案里的日期却仍是原来的，也不存在与其矛盾的其他报纸。书籍也被一遍遍收回并重写，无一例外地，重新发行时不会承认做过任何改动。甚至在温斯顿收到的，并在处理完之后被一律销毁的文字指令上，也不会说明或暗示要进行伪造行为，提到的总是笔误、错误、错印或错误引用，为准确起见，需要对其进行改正。

但实际上——他在重新调整富足部的数字时想——那根本算不上伪造，无非是用一句胡话代替另一句胡话。所处理的绝大多数材料跟现实世界毫无关联，甚至不具有某个赤裸裸的谎言与现实世界之间的那种关联。修改前和修改后的统计数字都是异想天开的产物，绝大多数情况下，那些数字都是指望你在脑子里杜撰出来的。例如，富足部预测本季度的靴子产量为一亿四千五百万双，而实际产量为六千两百万双，但温斯顿在重写预测数字时，将其降至五千七百万双，这样就可以照例声称超额完成定额。可是无论如何，六千两百万或五千七百万或一亿四千五百万跟真实数字比起来，在离谱程度上都是一样的，很有可能一双靴子也没有生产出来，更有可能的是谁也不知道生产了几双，更不用说关心了。你所知道的，只是每季度在纸上生产出天文数字的靴子，而在大洋国，可能一半人都打着赤脚。每一类被记录下来的事实都是如此，无论重要与否。一切退色成了个影子世界，到最后，连年份也变得不确定了。

温斯顿扫了一眼大厅。坐在对面相应位置小隔间里的，是个长相谨慎、下巴微黑的矮个男人，名叫狄洛森。他在不紧不慢地工作着，膝盖上放了张叠起来的报纸，嘴巴离口述记录器的话筒很近。他的样子像是尽量不让别人听到他所说的话，除了电屏。他抬起头，眼镜向温斯顿的方向敌意地反了一下光。

温斯顿对狄洛森了解极少，不知道他干的是什么工作。档案司的人不怎么谈论他们的工作。那条长长的、没有窗户的大厅里有两列小隔间，总能听到纸页的沙沙声和对口述记录器说话的嗡嗡声。在那些小隔间里工作的人们中，有十几个温斯顿连名字也不知道，虽然他也能在走廊里看到他们来去匆匆，或者在开两分钟仇恨会时挥舞双手。他知道隔壁小隔间里，那个黄红色头发的矮个女人一天到晚辛辛苦苦工作，只是从报章上查到并删去已被蒸发掉，因而被认为从未存在过的人们的名字。安排她做这种工作正合适，因为她自己的丈夫几年前就被蒸发掉了。在隔了几个小隔间的那一间工作的，是个性情温和、样子窝囊、心不在焉的家伙，名叫安普福斯，他耳朵上的汗毛长得很浓密，在把玩押韵和格律方面天分惊人。他的工作是为在意识形态方面有违碍之处，但出于这样那样的原因，需要保留在选集中的诗歌创作出窜改版本——他们称为定版本。这间大厅和在此工作的五十个左右的工作人员仅仅是某处下面的一个科，是档案司庞大而复杂机构中的一个细胞而已。往上往下，有一群群工作人员在干着种类多得无法想象的工作。有一些大型印刷厂，配有副编辑、排版专家和一些制作假照片的设备精密的照片室；有电屏节目科，其中有工程师、制作人和许多演员，这些演员之所以被特别挑选出来，是因为他们有模仿别人说话的技巧；还有许多提供咨询的工作人员，他们的工作，只是列出应当被收回的书籍和期刊清单；有巨大的仓库以存放篡改过的文本，还有看不见的炉子用来焚毁原件。在某个地方，有一些不知其名的头头脑脑，他们制定政策，确定过去的这部分需要保留，那部分需要伪造，另外的部分要完全清除，使其不复存在。

说到底，档案司本身仅仅是真理部的一个部门而已。真理部的主要工作不是重建过去，而是向大洋国公民提供报纸、电影、课本、电屏节目、比赛、小说——也就是每种可以想象到的信息、指示或娱乐，从雕像到标语，从抒情诗到生物学论文，从小孩子用的拼写书到新话词典。真理部不仅要满足党的各种各样的需求，而且在较低层次上为了服务群众，这种工作也在全力进行着。有一系列的司负责群众文学、音乐、电影、戏剧以及一般娱乐，在这里制造出垃圾报纸，除了体育、罪案、占星学几乎别无其他，还有内容耸人听闻的五分钱一本的中篇小说和色情电影。另外还有些伤感歌曲，完全是通过一种名为作曲机的特制搅拌机以机械方法谱写出来的。甚至有整整一个科——新话名字是“色情科”——从事的是最粗俗的色情作品的创作，发行时用的是密封包装，连党员——除了参与制作的党员——也不允许阅读。

温斯顿工作时，有三则通知从气力输送管里滑了出来，不过都是些简单的事情，两分钟仇恨会开始之前就处理完了。仇恨会结束后，他回到小隔间，从架子上取下新话词典，把口述记录器推到一边，擦了擦眼镜，然后开始着手干这天上午的主要工作。

温斯顿在生活中的最大乐趣来自工作，多数都是枯燥的常规工作，但其中也有些困难而且复杂，能让人像解数学难题一样沉浸其中——那是些精细的伪造工作，除了对英社原则的了解，以及对党希望你写什么有所估计之外，别无其他指南。温斯顿擅长做这种事，有时，他甚至受命修改《泰晤士报》的头版文章，那完全是用新话所写。他展开早些时候放在一边的通知，其内容是这样的：



泰晤士报3.12.83bb当日指示加加不好提到非人全面重写登档前提交



这则通知用旧话（或标准英语）可以这样写：



一九八三年十二月三日的《泰晤士报》对老大哥当日指示的报道极其不好，其中提到不存在的人。全部重写并在放入档案前把草稿提交上一级。



温斯顿通读了一遍那篇违碍文章。老大哥的当日指示似乎主要为表彰一个名为FFCC的机构的工作，该机构负责向水上堡垒里的水兵提供香烟及其他改善生活条件的用品。某位名叫威瑟斯的同志——他是内党要员——特别被点名并授予奖章，即二等卓越功勋奖章。

三个月后，FFCC突然被解散，原因不得而知。可以猜到的是威瑟斯及其同僚如今失宠了，但这件事未曾在报刊或电屏上报道过，这也在意料之中，因为政治犯通常不加审判，甚至通常也不会被公开批判。在牵涉到成千上万人的大清洗运动中，叛国者和思想犯被公审，他们卑躬屈膝地坦白罪行后被处决，但那只是几年才来一次，而且是特地做给人看的。更常见的是，党所不满的人只是失踪了，此后再无消息，从未有人知道他们被怎么样了。有些情况下，他们可能根本没死。不包括他的父母，温斯顿自己就认识可能有三十个左右先后失踪的人。

温斯顿用回形针轻轻刮着鼻子。对面那个小隔间里，狄洛森同志仍在诡秘地向口述记录器弯着身子。他把头抬起一会儿，眼镜片又是敌意地反了一下光。温斯顿琢磨狄洛森同志做的是不是跟他一样的工作，完全有可能，像这种棘手工作永远不会交给单独一个人去做，另一方面，把它交给一个委员会去做，就等于公然承认进行伪造工作。很有可能有多达十几人这时正在编写老大哥实际讲话的相反版本，不久，内党里的某位高参会选择这个或那个版本，对之进行再编辑，接着进入必要的相互参照的复杂程序，然后被选中的谎言载入永久档案，并成为事实。

温斯顿不知道威瑟斯为何失宠，也许因为腐败，要么是无能，也许老大哥只是除掉一个过于受欢迎的下属，也许威瑟斯或者他身边的某人被怀疑有异端倾向，要么也许——这最有可能——此事之所以发生，无非是因为清洗和蒸发是政府机制中的必要部分。通知中唯一一条真正的线索是“提到非人”，说明威瑟斯已经死了。人们被逮捕时，你不能每次都假定是这种情况，有时候他们会被释放，并在被处决前享有多达一两年的自由。有那么很少几次，某个被认为已死了很久的人在一次公审时，像鬼魂一样现了身，因为他的证词，导致另外几百人受到株连，然后他再次消失，这次是永久的。但威瑟斯已是个“非人”，他不存在，他从未存在过。温斯顿想好了，单是改变一下老大哥讲话的倾向还不够，最好让其谈及的，是跟原来的讲话主题毫无联系的事情。

他可以把讲话变成常见的对叛国者和思想犯的谴责，不过那有点过于明显，而生编出一次前线的胜利，或是第九个三年计划中成功超额生产，又可能把档案弄得太复杂，需要的是完全异想天开地编造。突然，他脑子里冒出似乎是现成的某位奥吉维同志的形象，他最近英勇牺牲在战场上。有时老大哥发出的每日指示中，是为了纪念某个地位低下的普通党员，他的生和死被认为是学习的榜样。这一天他会纪念奥吉维同志，几行印刷字和几张伪造的照片将让他马上实有其人。

温斯顿想了一会儿，然后将口述记录器拉向自己，开始以老大哥的熟悉风格口授：既是好战的又是迂腐的，而且因为用了先提出问题，接着马上回答的招数（“同志们，从这件事实中我们得到什么教训呢？这个教训——就是英社的基本原则——这个……”等等，等等），很容易摹仿。

三岁时，奥吉维同志除了一面鼓、一挺冲锋枪、一个直升飞机模型，不玩别的玩具。六岁时——提前了一年，属破格——他加入侦察队。九岁时，他当上了中队长。十一岁时，他偷听到他叔叔的谈话似乎具有犯罪倾向，就去思想警察那里把他叔叔告发了。十七岁时，他是青少年反性联盟的地方组织者。十九岁时，他设计了一种手榴弹被和平部采用，首次试用就炸死三十一个欧亚国的战俘。二十三岁时，他在战斗中失踪，带着重要公文飞越印度洋时，被敌方喷气机追击，他把自己和机关枪绑在一起跃出直升飞机跳进大海，带着公文之类——老大哥说这个归宿让人想起来不能不羡慕。对奥吉维同志一生的纯洁和心无杂念，老大哥还另外提了几句。他烟酒不沾，除了每天在健身房度过一小时，别无任何消遣。他誓言过独身生活，认为结婚及照顾家庭跟一天二十四个小时尽职尽责的生活相矛盾。除了英社的原则，他跟别人无话可谈，生活中除了打败欧亚国的军队和深挖出间谍、破坏分子、思想犯以及所有叛国者，别无其他内容。

温斯顿对要不要授予奥吉维同志卓越功勋奖章犹豫不决，最后决定不授予，因为那会导致不必要的相互参照的工作。

他又扫了一眼坐在对面小隔间里的那位竞争者，似乎有什么让他很肯定地知道狄洛森正在忙碌的工作跟他的一样。无法查明最后会用谁的工作成果，不过他确信会是他的。奥吉维同志，一小时前还未被想象出来，现在已是项事实。温斯顿突然想到，死人可以被创造出来，活人却不行，这称得上一桩奇事。奥吉维同志，现实中从未存在过，如今却存在于过去，一旦伪造行为被忘掉后，他能像查理曼大帝或恺撒大帝那样实实在在地存在，而且有同样证据可以证明。





第五章


食堂在地下很多层，天花板很低，领午餐的队伍缓慢地向前挪动。食堂里人满为患，极为嘈杂。柜台上的格栅那里，炖菜的热汽往上冒着，带了一股酸酸的金属味，然而仍未能完全压过胜利杜松子酒的气味。食堂内那头有个小酒吧，只是墙上开了个洞，花一角钱，就能在那儿买一大口杜松子酒。

“找的就是你。”有人在温斯顿背后说。

他转过身，是他的朋友塞姆，在研究司工作。也许“朋友”一词用得不是很准确。人们如今不会有朋友了，只有同志，但是跟有些同志在一起，比跟别的同志在一起愉快些。塞姆是位语言学家，是新话方面的专家，事实上，他是如今正从事《新话词典》第十一版编撰工作的数目庞大的专家之一。他是个身材特别矮小的家伙，比温斯顿还小。他长着黑头发，眼睛大而暴突，眼神既悲哀，又具有嘲弄性。跟你说话时，他的眼睛似乎在仔细研究你的脸。

“我想问问你还有没有剃须刀片。”他说。

“一片也没了！”温斯顿有点心虚地急着说，“我到处都找过，全用完了。”

人们总是来问你有没有剃须刀片，其实温斯顿还存起了两片没用。过去几个月里，剃须刀片特别紧缺。某一时间，总会有哪种必需品在党的店铺里供应不上，有时是钮扣，有时是织补毛线，有时是鞋带，目前是剃须刀片。实在想找一片的话，只能多少算是偷偷摸摸地去“自由”市场那里买到。

“我的那片已经用了六个星期。”他又不诚实地加了一句。

队伍又往前挪了一点。他们再次暂停下脚步时，温斯顿又转身和塞姆面对面。他们两人都从柜台上那堆油腻的托盘里取了一个。

“你昨天有没有去看绞死俘虏？”塞姆问道。

“在工作，”温斯顿冷淡地说，“我想我会从电影上看到的。”

“那可差得太远了。”塞姆说。

他那双嘲弄的眼睛在温斯顿的脸上扫来扫去。“我了解你，”那双眼睛似乎在说，“我看透了你，我很清楚你为什么没去看绞死俘虏。”从思维上说，塞姆正统到了恶毒的程度，会以幸灾乐祸的满足感谈论直升飞机对敌方村庄的袭击和思想犯先被审讯，然后招供、在仁爱部的地下室里处决人这种事，让人听得不舒服。跟他谈话时，主要就是把他从这些话题上岔开，然后有可能的话，用一些新话的技术性细节缠住他，他在这方面意见权威，而且听来有趣。温斯顿把头转开一点，以避开那双黑色眼睛的审视。

“绞得不错，”塞姆回味道，“不过我觉得美中不足的是，他们把俘虏的脚绑在一起，我喜欢看他们蹬脚的样子。最主要的是到了最后，他们的舌头往外伸得很长，颜色发青——青得发亮。我喜欢看的就是这些细节。”

“下一位，请！”那个系着白色围裙的群众手持长柄勺子喊道。

温斯顿和塞姆把他们的托盘塞到铁栅之下，一份午餐很快就放到上面：一小铁杯有点粉红兼苍白色的炖菜，一大块面包，一小块奶酪，一杯没放牛奶的咖啡和一片糖精。

“那边有张桌子，电屏下头，”塞姆说，“我们顺路也打点酒。”

酒盛在无把瓷杯子里。他们一路绕着走，穿过了拥挤的人群，到了室内那边，然后把托盘放在金属面的桌子上。在桌子一角，有人留下一摊炖菜，肮脏的稀稀一团，看上去像是吐出来的东西。温斯顿拿起他那杯酒，顿下来鼓了鼓勇气，然后把那带着油味的东西咽了下去。把眼里的泪珠眨掉后，他突然觉得腹内饥饿，开始一勺勺地吞下炖菜。除了总体上烂糟糟的感觉，炖菜里还有些粉红色的软四方块，很可能是肉制品。吃完小杯子里的炖菜之前，他们都没再说话。温斯顿左边身后不远的一张桌子上，有人在急促而且不打顿地说话，刺耳的叽里咕噜说话声几乎像鸭子在嘎嘎叫，在食堂里的一片喧哗中，倒是直达耳膜。

“词典编得怎么样了？”温斯顿问道，声音提高得盖过了喧哗声。

“不快。”塞姆说，“我编的是形容词，极有意思。”

一提到新话，他的精神马上为之一振。他把炖菜杯推到一旁，用细长的手拿起面包，另一只手拿着酒，把身子在桌子上倾过来，免得用大嗓门说话。

“第十一版是定本，”他说，“我们正在让语言最终定型——是人们不再说其他语言时的定型语言。等到我们完成后，像你这种人就必须重新学习一遍。我敢说，你以为我们的主要工作是创造新词，可是根本不沾边！我们在消灭单词——几十个几百个地消灭，每天都在消灭，我们把语言剔得只剩骨头。二零五零年前会变得过时的单词，第十一版里一个也不收。”

他狼吞虎咽地吃了几口面包，然后继续说话，带着有点学究式的热情。他那张又瘦又黑的脸庞变得生动，眼神里没了嘲弄，几乎是神驰天外的样子。

“消灭单词是件很美妙的事。当然，动词和形容词里的多余词最多，不过名词里也有几百个可以去掉，不仅是同义词，还有反义词。说到底，那些只是其他一些词相反意义的词有什么理由存在下去呢？一个词本身就包含了它的相反意义。比如说‘好’，有了像‘好’这样的词，还有什么必要存在另一个词‘坏’？‘不好’一样管用嘛——而且还要更好些，因为它是更准确的反义词，另一个则不是。再比如，要是你需要比‘好’语气强一些的词，有什么道理存在一连串像‘很棒’、‘一流’这样含义不明的无用词？‘加好’就能涵盖这个意义，要么如果你需要语气更强一点的，就用‘加加好’。当然，我们已经在使用这些词形，但在最终版本的新话里，不会再有别的词。到最后，只用六个词，就能全部涵盖好和坏的意义——实际上只是一个词。你难道看不出这有多妙吗，温斯顿？当然，这是老大哥最先想到的。”他想了想又补充道。

听到他提起老大哥的名字，温斯顿的脸上掠过一丝并非很热心的神色，可塞姆还是马上察觉到他有点缺乏热情。

“你没有真正意识到新话的好处，温斯顿。”他几乎是难过地说，“甚至在你用新话写作时，仍是用旧话思考。我有时候在《泰晤士报》上读到你写的文章。还算不错，不过是翻译性的。内心里，你宁愿抱着旧话不放，尽管它含糊，而且毫无用处地在含义上有许多差别。你没理解消灭单词的妙处。你知不知道新话是世界上唯一一种词汇总量在日趋缩小的语言？”

当然，温斯顿不知道这一点。他笑了，希望那是种表示赞成的笑，因为拿不准，他不敢开口说话。塞姆又咬了口黑面包，嚼了几下后接着说：

“你难道看不出新话的全部目标就是窄化思想范围吗？到了最后，我们将会让思想罪变得完全不可能再犯，因为没有单词可以表达它。每种必要的概念将被一个单词精确地表达出来，这个单词的意义有严格规定，其他次要意义将被消除，然后被忘掉。在第十一版里，我们离这个目标已经不远了，但是这个过程在你我死后仍会继续进行。年复一年，词汇量一直越来越小，意识的范围越来越窄。当然，即使是现在，也没什么理由或者借口去犯思想罪，这是个自律和现实控制的问题。但是到最后，就连这点也没必要。语言变得完美时，革命就算完成了，新话就是英社，英社就是新话。”他以一种神秘的满足感又说，“温斯顿，你有没有想到过，最迟到了二零五零年，没有一个活着的人会听懂我们现在的这种谈话？”

“除了——”温斯顿怀疑地开口说道，然而又打住了。

“除了群众”，那是他到了嘴边却没说出来的话，不过他控制住了自己，不肯定这句话从某种意义上说，算不算异端意见，然而塞姆猜到了他想说什么。

“群众不是人。”他随随便便地说，“到了二零五零年，很可能还要早一点，所有旧话中真正的知识都将已经消失，过去所有的文学作品都将已被消灭。乔叟，莎士比亚，弥尔顿，拜伦——他们的作品只会以新话版本存在，不只是变成了不一样的东西，而且实际上变成了跟以前意义相反的东西。甚至党的文献也会改变，连标语也会。在自由的概念已经被取消后，怎么会有‘自由即奴役’这种标语？整个思想氛围将不一样了。照我们现在看来，实际上将不再有思想了。正统意味着不去想——不需要去想，正统就是无意识。”

或早或晚，塞姆会被蒸发掉，温斯顿忽然想到并深信不疑。他太聪明了，他看得太明白，说得太露骨。党不喜欢这种人，总有一天他会失踪，这明明白白写在他脸上。

温斯顿已经吃完了面包和奶酪，他坐着向旁边稍微侧了点身子来喝他那杯咖啡。左边的桌子上，那个尖嗓门男人仍在没完没了地说话。一个背对温斯顿坐着，可能是他的秘书的年轻女孩在听他说话，好像在热切地对他所讲的一切都表示赞同。时不时地，温斯顿能听到像“我觉得您说得太对了，我太赞同您了”这种话，女孩的嗓门既年轻，又很愚蠢。但是另一个嗓门根本没打顿，甚至在那个女孩说话时也是。温斯顿跟那个男的只是面熟，只知道他在小说司里担任某要职。他三十岁左右，喉头发达，一张大嘴，巧舌如簧。他头有点往后仰着，而且由于他坐的角度，让他的眼镜片反射着光亮，在温斯顿看来，只看到两个空圆盘，看不到眼睛。微微有点可怕的，是他那张嘴里流泄出的声音，几乎一个词也分辨不出来。只有一次，温斯顿听到一组短语——“完全彻底铲除戈斯坦因主义”——很快地一口气全迸出来，像是铸成一行的铅字。其余仅仅是噪音，是一片叽叽嘎嘎之声。然而，尽管你无法听清他在说什么，但对他话里的基本内容，还是能猜个八九不离十。他可能在谴责戈斯坦因，要求对思想犯及破坏分子采取更严厉的措施，可能在猛烈抨击欧亚国部队的暴行，可能在歌颂老大哥或者马拉巴尔前线的英雄——都没关系，不管他说的是什么，可以肯定的是，他所说的每个字都绝对正统、绝对英社。温斯顿看着那张没有眼睛的脸还有一张一合的下巴时，有了种奇特的感觉，即这不是个真正的人，而是个假人。不是那个人的大脑，而是他的喉头在控制说什么。从他嘴里冒出的玩意儿有字也有词，可那不是真正意义上的讲话，而是无意识状态下发出的噪音，就像鸭子的嘎嘎叫声。

塞姆沉默了一会儿，他用勺子柄在那摊炖菜上画着图案。来自邻座的声音仍在很快地嘎嘎叫，尽管周围一片喧哗，却仍清晰可闻。

“新话里有个词，”塞姆说，“不晓得你知不知道‘鸭讲’，就是像鸭子那样嘎嘎叫着说话。它是那种具有两种相反意义的词，挺有意思。用在敌人身上是辱骂，用在与你意见一致的人身上，就是赞扬。”

毫无疑问，塞姆将被蒸发掉，温斯顿又想道。他想着想着感到一丝悲哀，尽管他很清楚塞姆轻视他，还有点不喜欢他，有理由的话，也完全有可能把他温斯顿当做思想犯揭发。塞姆身上有点隐隐约约不对劲的地方，他缺少某种东西：谨慎，超脱，一种藏拙的能力。不能说他不正统，他信仰英社的原则，对老大哥怀有崇敬之心，听到打胜仗就欢欣鼓舞，痛恨异端分子，不仅是真心实意，而且有种不可遏制的热情，消息也颇灵通，为一般党员所不及。但他隐隐约约有种不可信任的样子，有些最好不说的话他会说出来，读书读得太多，经常光顾栗树咖啡馆，那是画家、音乐家出没的地方。没有法律，甚至也没有不成文的法律规定不可以时常光顾栗树咖啡馆，但那里不知为何，是个不祥之地。那些名誉扫地的党的前领导人被清洗前，经常在那里相聚。据说几年或几十年前，戈斯坦因自己有时也在那里露面。塞姆的命运不难预见，然而仍然存在这一事实：要是塞姆掌握了他的，也就是温斯顿的秘密想法哪怕只有三秒，就会马上向思想警察揭发他。就此而言，谁都会那样做，但塞姆会最积极。光有热情还不够，正统是无意识。

塞姆抬起头。“帕森斯来了。”他说。

他似乎话里还有话：“那个操蛋的蠢货。”帕森斯，也就是与温斯顿同在胜利大厦的住户，确实正从室内那边穿过来。他身体发福，中等高度，淡色头发，脸长得像青蛙。他现年三十五岁，脖子和腰部已经堆上了一坨坨脂肪，然而动作却敏捷得像个小伙子。他的整个外表像那种长得大块头的小男孩，相像得尽管他穿的是普通工作服，你仍然几乎不可能不想象他穿的是侦察队的那种蓝短裤、灰衬衫和红领巾。脑子里想起他的模样时，总会想到一对胖得有了小坑的膝盖和胖鼓鼓的小臂上挽起来的衣袖。确实，只要遇到像集体远足或者其他活动，就能让他有理由穿短裤，帕森斯总是无一例外地再次穿上短裤。他向他们两位喜气洋洋地说了声“你好，你好！”就在这张桌子前坐了下来，身上散发着浓烈的汗臭。他那张粉红色脸庞上挂满汗珠，他的出汗能力倒是令人咋舌，在集体活动中心，总能根据乒乓球拍把的潮湿程度判断出他何时打了球。塞姆已经拿出一张纸条，上面有一列单词，他用手指夹着一杆蘸水笔在研究。

“你瞧他吃饭时间还用功呢，”帕森斯用肘部顶了一下温斯顿说，“热情万丈啊，是不是？你在干什么，伙计？我估计对我来说太高深了。史密斯伙计，我跟你说我干吗要追着你，是为了你忘了交的捐款。”

“什么捐款？”温斯顿问道，下意识就去摸钱包。大家工资的四分之一必须主动捐出去，名堂多如牛毛，很难每项都记得清楚。

“为仇恨周的，你知道——每家都要出。我是我们那个区的出纳。我们可是在全力以赴要大张旗鼓地表现一番。我跟你说，要是胜利大厦挂的旗帜数量在整条街上拿不了第一，你可怪不到我头上。你答应过我捐两块钱。”

温斯顿找到两张皱巴巴、脏乎乎的钞票递给帕森斯，后者用文盲的那种整洁字体记到一个小笔记本上。

“还有，伙计，”他说，“听说我家那个小崽子昨天用弹弓打了你，为这事我把他狠狠修理了一顿，真的，我告诉他再那么干，就没收他的弹弓。”

“我想他是因为没看成处决人而有点儿不开心。”温斯顿说。

“哎，对了——这就是我想说的意思，这反映了思想对头，是不是？虽然他们是淘气的小崽子，两个都是，不过他们的热情可真没说的！他们想的只是侦察队，当然还有战争。你知不知道我那个小女孩上星期六，也就是在她们的中队去伯克海姆斯德方向远足时干了件什么事？她叫上另外两个女孩跟她一起从远足队伍里溜开了，花了整整一下午时间跟踪一个陌生人。她们跟了他有两小时，一直穿过森林，到了阿默夏姆后，向巡逻队揭发了那个人。”

“她们干吗要那么干？”温斯顿多少有点吃惊地问。帕森斯又扬扬自得地说：

“我的小孩儿认准他是个敌特什么的——比如说可能是空投下来的。但是关键在这儿，伙计。你猜猜她一开始是怎么注意上他的？她看到他穿了双古怪的鞋子，所以有可能是个外国人。对七岁的小孩子来说够聪明的了，对不对？”

“那人后来怎么样了？”

“噢，那个嘛，我当然不知道喽，可要是这样了，我可一点儿也不会吃惊。”他做了个步枪瞄准的动作，嘴里还发出开枪声。

“好。”塞姆心不在焉地说。他仍在看那张纸条，头也没抬一下。

“当然，我们不能掉以轻心。”温斯顿老老实实地表示赞同。

“我的意思是如今还在打仗。”帕森斯说。

像是为了确认这一点，正好在他们头顶的电屏里传出一阵小号声。但这次不是宣布一次军事胜利，而只是来自富足部的一则通知。

“同志们！”一个慷慨激昂的年轻声音高声说，“注意，同志们！我们有喜讯要宣布！我们在生产上又打了胜仗！根据刚刚完成的对各种消费品的统计表明，过去一年里，生活水平提高了百分之二十以上。今天上午，在大洋国各地都有无法劝阻的自发游行，劳动者迈出工厂和办公室，在街道上举旗游行，以表达对老大哥的感激之情，由于他的英明领导，带给了我们崭新的幸福生活。这里有一些统计数字：食品——”

“我们崭新的幸福生活”这几个词出现了好几次，这是富足部最近喜欢用的。帕森斯的注意力也被小号声吸引过去，他坐在那里听着，表情严肃，张着嘴巴，也有点听明白后不耐烦的样子。他听不懂数字，但是他明白在某种意义上，那些数字是带来满足的原因。他早已掏出一个肮脏的大烟斗，里面填了一半焦黑的烟丝。一星期的烟丝定量只有一百克，很少可以将烟斗装得太满。温斯顿在吸一根胜利烟，小心翼翼地水平拿着。新定量到明天才有，而他只剩四根。他暂时闭上眼睛，对远处的喧哗充耳不闻，而是在听电屏里连续播放的东西。似乎甚至还提到，因为老大哥把巧克力定量提高到二十克而举行了向他表示感谢的游行。他想到不过是昨天才宣布定量被降至一星期二十克，有没有可能才过了二十四小时，他们就又轻易相信了？没错，他们又相信了。帕森斯以他那种畜牲般的蠢劲很容易就相信了，那个看不到眼睛的家伙狂热地相信了，而且怀着满腔怒火，要把会提出上星期的定量是三十克的任何人挖出来，批判他，蒸发他。塞姆通过某种更为复杂的方式也相信了，那需要用到双重思想。如此说来，他是不是独一无二地拥有那种记忆？

离奇的统计数字继续从电屏里涌将出来。跟去年相比，有了更多衣服，更多房屋，更多家具，更多饭锅，更多燃料，更多轮船，更多直升飞机，更多书籍，更多婴儿——除了疾病、犯罪和精神病，一切都更多了。一年年，分分钟，每个人，所有事，都在向上嗖嗖地快速发展。跟塞姆刚才那样，温斯顿拿起勺子，在桌子上流淌着的苍白色肉汁里随意划拉，把原来的一长溜划拉成了一幅图案。他带着恨意沉思着生活的物质结构。是不是一直就是这样？是不是食物一直就是这个味道？他环顾食堂。这是一间天花板很低、人头拥挤的屋子，墙上由于人们身体的无数次接触而变得肮脏；金属桌椅破破烂烂，间隔近得坐下能互相碰到肘部；弯了柄的勺子，变形的托盘，粗糙的白杯子；所有东西的表面都有油腻，所有裂缝里都有污垢；还有劣酒、劣咖啡、金属味炖菜以及脏衣服那酸不溜秋的混合气味。在你的胃和皮肤里，总有种抗议和感觉，就是你被骗走了有权拥有的某种东西。确实，他对所有事物的记忆都没有太大差别。在他能够清楚记得的无论哪个时候，从来都是吃的东西不大够，内衣或袜子总是到处有洞，家具总是陈旧不堪，以至于就要散架，房间里暖气供应不足，拥挤的地铁，房屋摇摇欲垮，面包黑乎乎的，茶叶成了稀缺之物，咖啡尝来像是脏东西，香烟供应不足——除了合成的杜松子酒，什么都不便宜，什么都缺乏。缺乏舒适，灰尘，所用不足，冗长的冬季，黏乎乎的袜子，从来不开的电梯，冰凉的水，粗砂般的肥皂，散落开来的香烟，味道奇差的食物。当然，随着年纪增长，事情还要变得更糟些，尽管如此，如果上述一切能让人心生厌恶，难道不说明了正常的发展不应该是这样？为什么一定需要一些年代久远的记忆，让人记着以前并非如此时，才会觉得这些是不可忍受的？

他又环顾了食堂一眼。几乎每个人都长得丑陋，就算穿的是蓝色工作服之外的其他衣服，也仍然丑陋。屋里那头的一张桌子前，只有一个人坐在那儿，是个矮个子，长得特别像甲虫。他在喝一杯咖啡，一双小眼睛猜疑地扫来扫去。温斯顿心想，不往周围看一看，太容易就会相信党所树立的完美体格形象——身材高大，肌肉发达的男青年和胸部丰满的少女，头发金黄，生气勃勃，晒足太阳，无忧无虑——不仅存在，甚至占大多数。实际上依他所见，第一空域的大部分人都身材矮小、皮肤发黑、长相难看。奇怪的是，那种长得像甲虫的人在部里的数量激增：又矮又胖的男人，没多大年纪就发福，腿短，走路动作奇快，胖脸上的表情高深莫测，眼睛又小到十分。似乎在党的主宰下，最盛产这种体型的人。

富足部的通知播报完了，又响起一声小号，接下来播放的是又尖又细的音乐。因为受到数字的轰炸，帕森斯被唤起一点隐约的热情，取下嘴里的烟斗。

“富足部今年干得确实不错。”他说着还会意地晃了晃头，“顺便问一句，史密斯伙计，我估计你也没有剃须刀片可以让给我用？”

“一片也没有，”温斯顿说，“我自己一个刀片都用六星期了。”

“噢，这样啊——只是想着可以问下你，伙计。”

“对不起。”温斯顿说。

邻桌那个像鸭子般嘎嘎叫的声音刚才在播报富足部通知时暂停了一会儿，这时又响起来，跟以前一样吵。不知为何，温斯顿突然想起帕森斯太太，想着她稀疏的头发和她脸上皱纹里的灰尘。用不了两年，她的孩子会向思想警察告发她。帕森斯太太将被蒸发掉，奥布兰会被蒸发掉。另一方面，帕森斯永远不会被蒸发掉，那个看不到眼睛、嘴里嘎嘎叫的家伙将永远不会被蒸发掉，那些甲虫一样在部里迷宫般的走廊里敏捷穿行的男人也永远不会被蒸发掉。那个黑头发女孩，也就是小说司的那个女孩——她也永远不会被蒸发掉。他好像本能地知道谁会活下来，谁会被消灭，只不过至于什么是活下来的原因，有点不容易说出来。

就在此时，他被猛地从遐思中拉回到现实。邻桌的女孩半转过身，是那个黑头发女孩。她在斜视他，但奇怪的是她看得很专心。在他们眼光接触的刹那，她又望向别处。

温斯顿的脊背上冒出汗来，一种极度恐惧的感觉掠过心头。这种感觉几乎转瞬即逝，然而留下一种让人不得安宁的难受感觉。她为什么在注视他？为什么总在跟踪他？不幸的是，他记不清楚他到这里坐的时候，她是否已经坐在那张桌子前，要么是后来才去的。但不管怎样，在那次两分钟仇恨会里，她无缘无故坐在他身后。很有可能，她真正的目的是想听清楚他喊得够不够响亮。

他又有了以前的想法：很可能她并非真的是思想警察的一员，然而还是那句话，正是业余警察才最危险。他不知道她看了他有多久，但有可能多达五分钟，有可能他的表情没能完全控制住。在公共场合或电屏视域之内，让心思信马由缰危险之至，最细微的事情也可能让暴露：一次不由自主的痉挛，一个下意识的焦虑表情，一种自言自语的习惯——就是那种暗示不正常或者有所隐瞒的小细节。不管怎样，脸上带着不当的表情（例如在听到宣布某个胜利消息时露出怀疑的表情），本身就是件应该受到惩罚的罪过。新话里甚至有个词：“表情罪”，指的就是这个。

那个女孩又转过身子。也许说到底，她并非真的在跟踪他，也许她连续两天和他坐得那样近只是碰巧。他的烟卷已经熄灭，他小心翼翼把它放到桌子边上，要是能让烟丝不掉出来，他可以在下班后吸。邻桌那个男人很可能是个思想警察，很可能他史密斯三天内会被关进仁爱部的牢房，但是烟头不可浪费。塞姆叠起那张纸片放进口袋。帕森斯又开始说话：

“伙计，我有没有跟你说过，”他嘴里含着烟斗，格格笑着说，“就是那次我的两个小家伙点火烧了市场上那个老女人的裙子？那是因为他们看到她用一张B.B.的宣传画裹香肠。他们悄悄溜到她身后，用一盒火柴把她裙子点着了。我想她给烧得够戗。还是小崽子啊，是不是？可真是热情万丈！那就是他们如今在侦察队里接受的一流训练——甚至比我那时候接受的训练还要好。你知道他们最近发了什么吗？能隔着锁眼听声音的助听器！我那个小女孩有天晚上拿回家在我们的起居室试用，说比她单用耳朵在锁眼上能多听到一倍的声音。当然我得跟你说，那只是个玩具，不过仍然能培养他们的正确思想，对不对？”

就在这时，电屏里发出一声刺耳的哨声，是该回去工作的信号。他们三个人都一跳而起抢着去坐电梯，温斯顿那根烟卷里的烟丝掉了出来。





第六章


温斯顿在写日记：



那是三年前的事了。一个漆黑的夜晚，在某个大火车站附近一条窄窄的小街上。她站在墙边的门口，就在一盏几乎一点也不亮的路灯下。她面容年轻，脂粉涂得很厚，事实上是脂粉吸引了我，白得像面具，还有鲜红的嘴唇。女党员从不涂脂抹粉。街上别无一人，没有电屏。她说两块钱，我——



他一时觉得太难写下去。他闭上眼睛用手指压迫眼球，想挤出那幅不断出现的画面。他几乎有种不可遏止的冲动，想扯着嗓子喊出一连串脏话，或者以脑袋撞墙，用脚踢桌子，把墨水瓶扔出窗外——也就是做任何一种要么激烈，要么声音大，要么会带来疼痛的事，好让他有可能不再去想那些折磨他的记忆。

他想，你最大的敌人是自己的神经系统，你内心的紧张随时可能以可见的表象反映出来。他想到几周前在街上碰到的一个男人：那是个很是其貌不扬的男人，党员，年龄在三十五到四十岁之间，长得又高又瘦，手里拿了个公文包。他们相距几米远时，他注意到那个男人的左脸突然可以说是因为痉挛而扭曲了一下，他们擦肩而过时又是一下。仅仅扯动了一下，一丝颤动，就像照相机的快门喀嚓一下那样迅速，显然是习惯使然。他还记得当时是怎么想的：那个可怜鬼是完蛋了。最可怕的是，那一举动很可能是下意识的，然而最致命的危险是说梦话，在温斯顿看来，那防不胜防。

他吸了口气继续写道：



我跟着她进了门，穿过后院进到一间地下室厨房。那里靠墙处有张床，桌子上有盏灯，拧得很暗。她——



他咬紧牙关，有种想呕吐的感觉。想到地下室里那个女人的同时，他还想到了凯瑟琳，他的妻子。温斯顿是已婚的——不管怎么说，他结过婚，很可能仍属已婚，因为据他所知，他的妻子还活着。他好像又闻到地下室里那种不新鲜的气味，它混合着臭虫、脏衣服和廉价的劣质香水味，但仍然诱人，因为女党员从来不用香水，也不可能想象她们会用，只有群众才用。在他看来，香水味与私通密不可分地搅和在一起。

跟着那个女人进去时，那是他大约两年来头一次行为不检。当然，和妓女发生关系在被禁止之列，不过它是那种你间或会鼓起胆量去违犯的规定。危险，但也不是事关生死。被抓到和妓女在一起，可能意味着要在劳改营待上五年，未犯其他罪行的话，不会判得更多。这件事也很容易，前提是别被当场抓到。贫民窟那里，到处是愿意出卖自己肉体的女人，甚至有些女的索价只是一杯杜松子酒而已，群众不允许喝那个。党虽然没有明确表示，却倾向鼓励卖淫，以使未能完全压制的本能有途径发泄。单纯的放荡并无太大关系，只要是在偷偷摸摸和缺乏乐趣之中进行，而且只涉及底层被鄙视阶层的女人。不可饶恕的罪行乃党员之间的乱搞，但是——尽管在大清洗中，被告都无一例外坦白犯了这种罪——很难想象真的会发生这种事。

党的目标不仅是阻止男人和女人形成相互忠诚的关系，这种关系可能是党无法控制的，党真正的也是未曾讲明的目的，是让性行为完全没有快乐。不要爱得过分，因为性欲就是敌人，不管婚内还是婚外。所有党员之间的婚姻必须由某个专门为此成立的委员会批准，但是——指导原则却从未明白列出——如果两个人给别人造成印象——他们在肉体上相互吸引，他们总是结不成婚。婚姻唯一被承认的目的，是生出为党服务的后代。性交被视为一种有点让人恶心的小手术，就像灌肠。同样，这也从未明明白白写出来过，但它是以间接方式，向每个党员从孩童时期就开始灌输的。甚至还有像青少年反性联盟这种组织，它鼓吹男女完全独身，所有孩子都由人工受精得来（新话里叫“人受”），然后由公家抚养。温斯顿明白他们并非绝对说到做到，然而不管怎样，这与党的主要意识形态一致。党正在试图扼杀性本能，或者说如果不能完全扼杀，就扭曲它，丑化它。他不知道怎么会这样，但好像这是自然而然的事。至少在女性身上，党的努力大体上是成功的。

他又想起了凯瑟琳。他们分居已有九年，十年——差不多十一年了。奇怪的是他极少想到她，他会一连好几天忘了自己是已婚的。他们在一起才过了十五个月。党不允许离婚，不过如果没有孩子，倾向于鼓励分居。

凯瑟琳身材高挑，淡色头发，很严肃，举止极为得体。她的脸部轮廓分明，老鹰一般，如果不了解这张脸背后几乎是空洞无物，就可能认为这是一张尊贵的脸。他们刚结婚后不久，他就认定了——虽然只是因为比起其他绝大多数人，他对她更熟悉罢了——在他认识的所有人当中，她毫无疑问最愚蠢、最俗气、头脑最空洞。她的脑子里除了标语，没有别的想法，无论什么样的蠢话，只要出自于党，她一概，绝对是一概接受。他在内心给她起了个外号，叫她“人体录音”。但如果不是纯粹为了某件事，他还是能忍着和她一起生活的，那就是性。

他每次一碰她，她就好像往后缩，而且绷紧了身体，抱着她，就像抱着一个有关节的木头人。奇怪的是，即使在她紧搂他时，他还有种感觉她同时也在用尽全力推开他，她紧绷的肌肉给他造成了这种印象。她会闭着眼躺在那儿，既不反抗，也不合作，然而是顺从的。这点特别让人难堪，再过上一段时间，就变成令人讨厌的了。但即使那样，假如双方都同意保持禁欲，他还是能忍受和她一起生活的，但是怪就怪在是凯瑟琳拒绝这样。她说如果能够，他们必须生出一个小孩，所以要继续有房事，很有规律地每星期一次，除非是在不可能怀孕那段期间。她甚至常常早上就提醒他，把它作为一件当天晚上一定要做、不可忘记的事情。她对这件事有两种叫法，一是“做宝宝”，二是“我们对党的义务”——没错，她真的那样叫过。不久，当指定的那天即将到来时，他开始有了种很恐惧的感觉。所幸未能养出孩子来，到最后她同意放弃尝试，不久就跟他分居了。

温斯顿无声地叹了口气。他再次捡起笔写道：



她一下子就躺倒在床上，然后马上没有一点前奏地，用你能想象到的最粗鄙、最丑陋的动作撩起裙子。我——



他好像看到自己站在暗淡的灯光下，鼻孔里充满臭虫和廉价香水的气味，他心里有种失败和憎恨的感觉，甚至在当时，这些感觉仍与关于凯瑟琳那具白色躯体的回忆纠缠在一起，那具躯体被党的催眠力永远施了定身术。为什么总会这样？为什么他无法拥有自己的女人，而是隔几年一次来做这种龌龊事？但是真正的恋爱几乎不可想象。女党员都差不多，在她们心里，禁欲像对党的忠诚一样根深蒂固。通过小心的早期培养，通过比赛和洗冷水澡，通过在学校、侦察队和青年团里没完没了向她们灌输的垃圾，通过演讲、游行、歌曲、口号和军乐，自然的感情已被清除出她们的内心。理性告诉他肯定有例外，然而他心里也不相信。她们一概从不动心，党也正想让她们那样。他想做的，比想被人爱的愿望更强烈的，是摧毁这道贞操之墙，一辈子哪怕成功一次也好。带来欢娱的性行为就是反抗。欲望是思想罪。即使是唤醒凯瑟琳的欲望——如果他做到过——也算是诱奸，尽管她是他的妻子。

但是这件事的剩余部分还是要写下来。他写道：



我拧亮了灯。我在灯光下看到她时——



在阴暗中待过之后，煤油灯光好像很明亮。他第一次能看清那个女人的样子。他向她迈近一步，然后停下来，心里充满欲望和恐惧。他痛苦地意识到在这种地方的危险性，完全有可能巡逻队会在他出去时抓住他，事实上，那时他们可能正在门口等着。怎么可能不达到目的就走？！

一定要写下来，一定要坦白出来。在灯光下，他突然看到那个女人是个上岁数的。她脸上的脂粉厚得似乎有可能像纸板面具一样破裂开来。她头上有缕缕白发，但真正可怕的，是她的嘴唇有点儿合不拢，除了深深的黑洞别无他物，她的牙齿全掉光了。

他仓促写着，笔迹潦草不堪：



灯光下看到她，她是个很老的女人，至少有五十岁，但是我仍然没迟疑就干了那事。



他用手指压着眼皮。他终于把它写下来了，但是感觉没什么不同。这个办法没奏效，那种想扯开嗓子喊脏话的冲动跟以前一样强烈。





第七章


“如果有希望，”温斯顿写道，“它就在群众身上。”

如果有希望，它一定是在群众身上，因为只有在那里，在那些被漠视的大批人身上，在占大洋国人口百分之八十五的人身上，才有可能产生将党摧毁的力量。党无法从内部推翻，其敌人——如果有敌人的话——无法走到一起并相互确认。即使传言中的兄弟会存在——有可能而已——其成员碰头也只可能是以三三两两的方式。反抗意味着一个眼神，声音里的一点变化，至多会是偶尔的一句传闻而已。然而如果群众能意识到自身的力量，他们不需要密谋，而只需奋力而起，像马摆脱苍蝇那样抖动身躯。愿意的话，他们明天早上就能把党砸成碎片。或早或晚，他们肯定会想到去做那件事，难道不是吗？但是——！

他想起有一次，他正在一条拥挤的街道上走着，突然几百个极其喧嚣的声音——女人的声音——从前边不远处的一条小街上传来。那是种可怕的愤怒和绝望的声音，一种低沉而大声的“噢—噢—噢—噢—噢！”叫声，嗡嗡的声音像是一口钟的回响。他的心脏猛烈跳动起来。开始了！他想。暴乱！群众终于挣脱羁绊了！到那个地点后，他看到的是两三百个女人正围着街边市场的摊档。那些女人一脸悲痛，好像是一条正在下沉的船上劫数已定的乘客。就在那时，普遍的绝望一下子又变成许多张嘴巴的争吵。好像是某个摊档在卖铁锅，是种质量很差的不结实货色，但是不管什么样的饭锅，总是很难买到，在那时出乎意料停止供应。成功买到铁锅的女人在费劲地拎着铁锅走掉，却被别的人推推搡搡。还有十几个人围着那个摊档吵闹，指责那个摊主看人卖货，另外还藏着铁锅。接着又响起一阵大吵大嚷声。有两个身材臃肿的女人，其中一个披头散发，正在争夺铁锅，都在用力想从对方手里扯过来。有一会儿，两人在同时用力拉，结果铁锅的把手掉了。温斯顿恶心地看着她们。但是——尽管只有那么一阵子——仅仅几百个嗓子吼出的声音听起来几乎力量骇人！他们为什么从来不为值得一吼的事也像那样吼起来？

他写道：



除非他们觉醒，否则永远不会反抗，但除非他们反抗，否则不会觉醒。



他想到那几乎像是从党的教科书上抄来的。当然，党声称是自己把群众从奴役中解放出来。革命前，他们被资本家残酷压迫，吃不饱饭，还要挨打。女人也被迫在煤矿干活（事实上现在还有），儿童长到六岁就被卖进工厂。但同时，完全按照双重思想的原则，党教导说群众天生低人一等，必须用一些简单的规定把他们置于服从的地位。事实上对于群众，人们了解得很少，也没必要了解很多。只要他们继续干活、繁衍，他们别的行为就无关紧要。他们被放任自流，就像阿根廷的平原上没有笼缰的牛群。他们过着似乎是返璞归真、类似他们祖先所过的生活。他们在贫民窟出生、长大，十二岁开始干活，度过蓬勃却短暂的健美和和性冲动期，二十岁结婚，三十岁就步入中年，然后死去，多数寿命不超过六十岁。他们脑子里想的全是重体力劳动、养家糊口、跟邻居为鸡毛蒜皮之事争吵、电影、足球、啤酒，还有最主要的赌博。把他们控制住不算困难。思想警察的特务总在他们中间出没，传播谣言，瞄上并消灭被认为有可能变得危险的个别人。然而没人努力向他们灌输党的意识形态，对群众来说，不需要很强的政治感，需要他们拥有的，只是一种初级的爱国主义，用得上时，可以随时唤起他们的这种感情，让他们接受更长工作时间和更少定量。甚至在他们变得不满足时——有时确实会——其不满足感也不会带来什么后果。由于缺乏总体上的概念，他们只会专注于一些细枝末节的不如意之事，从来看不到还有更大的罪恶。绝大多数群众家里甚至没有电屏，连民警也很少管他们的事。伦敦的犯罪率极高，有个充斥着小偷、强盗、妓女、毒品小贩和形形色色骗徒的天地，但是因为犯罪都发生在群众自己中间，因而无关紧要。所有道德问题上，他们也被允许继承其先辈的规范。党在性问题上的禁欲主义并未强加给他们。乱交不受惩罚，允许离婚。甚至如果群众表露出有宗教信仰的需求或者愿望，也能得到许可。他们不配被怀疑，正如党的标语所称：“群众和动物是自由的。”

温斯顿的手往下探，小心地挠了挠静脉曲张溃疡的地方，那里又痒了起来。有件事他每次都会想起，即不可能知道革命前生活的真正情形如何。他从抽屉里拿出一本小孩用的历史课本，是从帕森斯太太那里借来的。他开始把课本上的一段抄进日记：



在过去（课本上写道），在伟大的革命之前，伦敦并非是我们如今所知的美丽城市，而是个黑暗、肮脏、无比糟糕的地方，只有极少数人能吃饱饭，而成千上万穷人脚上没有靴子穿，头上无片瓦遮身。年龄不比你大的儿童每天必须为凶残的主人工作十二个小时，他们动作太慢的话，就会被主人用鞭子抽打，只有不新鲜的面包皮和水来填腹。

然而在一片赤贫状态下，还有几幢华美大屋，里面住的是富人，有多达三十个仆人服侍他们。这些富人被称为资本家。他们长得肥胖而丑陋，面相邪恶，就像本页后面的插图那样。你可以看到，他身穿长长的黑色大衣，那被称为大氅，头上戴的是顶古怪而发亮的帽子，样子像是火炉管，被称为高顶礼帽。这就是资本家的统一着装，其他任何人都不允许穿。

资本家拥有世界上的一切，其他所有人都是他们的奴隶。他们拥有一切土地、一切房屋、一切工厂和一切金钱。任何人不服从他们，他们可以把他投进监狱，或者让他失去工作而饿死。凡在普通人跟资本家说话时，必须向他鞠躬作揖，取下自己的帽子并称他为“先生”。全体资本家的头领被称为国王，而且——



但他已经知道下文如何。还会提到身披细麻法衣的主教、身披白鼬皮长袍的法官、足手枷具、惩罚踏车、九尾鞭、市长老爷的宴会和亲吻教皇的脚尖等。另外还有种叫做“初夜权”的名堂，大概不会在给儿童用的课本上提到，它是一条法律，也就是每个资本家都有权跟在他的工厂里干活的女工睡觉。

你怎能判断出有多少是谎言？有可能人们如今的平均生活水平确实比革命前提高了一点，唯一相反的证据，是你骨头里的无声抗议，那是种本能的感觉，即你现在的生活状况无法忍受，而在别的某个时期肯定不一样。他突然想到，现代生活的真正独具特色之处，并非它的残酷和不安全，而只是一无所有、肮脏和倦怠。看看周围吧，生活不仅跟电屏里喋喋不休的谎言毫无相似之处，跟党想努力达到的理想境界比较起来，更是天差地别。生活中的最大部分，都是中性和非政治性的，甚至对党员来说也是如此，也就是辛辛苦苦干着枯燥的工作，蹭别人的糖精片，缝补破破烂烂的袜子，节省下一个烟头，等等。党所描绘出的理想世界是个巨大、可怕和光彩夺目的世界，一个拥有庞大且骇人听闻的武器的钢筋水泥世界，一个由战士和狂热分子组成的国家，迈着绝对一致的步伐前进，全有同样的想法，呼喊着同样的口号，永远在工作、战斗、打胜仗、迫害别人——三亿人有着同样的面孔。现实却是处于衰败中的肮脏城市，在这里，填不饱肚子的人们穿着破烂的鞋子拖着脚步走动，住修修补补过的建造于十九世纪的房屋，里面总有股煮卷心菜味和厕所里的那种臭味。他似乎看到了伦敦的景观，辽阔而又破败，是座拥有上百万垃圾筒的城市，跟这一景观混合在一起的，还有帕森斯太太的形象，她脸上布满皱纹，头发稀疏，正在徒劳地鼓捣堵塞了的下水管。

他又探手下去挠了挠他的脚脖。电屏日以继夜往你的耳朵里塞满统计数字，以证明如今人们有更多食品、更好的房屋、更好的娱乐——所以他们跟五十年前的人们比起来更长寿，工作时间较前缩短，更魁梧，更健康，更健壮，更快乐，更聪明，所受教育更好，其中没有一个词能被证明或推翻。例如，党声称如今有百分之四十的群众识字，而据说革命前的识字率为百分之十五。党还声称如今的婴儿死亡率只有千分之一百六，革命前的数字则为千分之三百——诸如此类，如同有两个未知数的等式。完全有可能的是历史课本上的每个字，甚至那些已被不加怀疑接受的，都完全出自想象。据他所知，可能根本没有过什么“初夜权”的法律，也没有被称为资本家的人和高顶礼帽这种着装。

一切都已隐没在迷雾中。过去被清除，连清除行为也被忘却，谎言变成了事实。仅仅有那么一次，他拥有过——是在那件事发生之后，这是关键所在——具体而确凿无疑的证据，可以证明有过伪造行为。他曾把它拿在手指间长达半分钟之久。那一定是在一九七三年——不管怎样，他和凯瑟琳差不多那时已经分居。然而真正与之相关的日子，是在往前七八年的时候。

真正说起来，此事要从六十年代中期说起。大清洗时，革命时期党的首批领导人被永远清除掉了。到一九七零年时，除了老大哥自己，其他领导人一个不剩，都被当做叛国者和反革命分子被揭露出来。戈斯坦因逃掉了，藏匿到一个不为人知的地方，至于其他人，有几个只是失踪了而已，而多数在场面宏大的公审中坦白所犯罪行后就被处决了。最后剩下三个人叫琼斯、艾朗森和鲁瑟福，他们三人被捕的时间肯定是在一九六五年。跟经常发生的一样，他们消失一年多，生死不明。然后突然如通常那样，他们被亮相并坦白自己所犯罪行。他们坦白曾经通敌（当时的敌国也是欧亚国）、贪污公款、谋杀党的负责人以及阴谋推翻老大哥的领导等，是在革命开始前很久就开始的。另外他们还进行破坏活动，导致成百上千人死亡。坦白完这些罪行后，他们得到赦免并被恢复党内地位，被安置了听着很重要，实则是挂名性质的职位。他们三个人都写了冗长而语气可怜的文章，发表在《泰晤士报》上，其中分析了自己变节的原因，并保证改过自新。

他们被释放后不久，温斯顿的确在栗树咖啡馆见过他们。他还记得当时用眼角看着他们时的那种半是害怕半是着迷的心态。他们三人都比他年长，是很久以前那个世界的遗留物，几乎是党早期峥嵘岁月留下来的最后几个大人物，他们身上依稀仍有地下斗争和内战留下的风采。尽管到那时，真相和年代已经变得模糊，他还是有种感觉，就是他得知他们的名字要比得知老大哥的名字要早一些。他也能感到他们是罪犯、敌人、不可接触者，注定要在一两年内身名俱灭。任何人只要落到思想警察手里，到最后总在劫难逃。他们只是行尸走肉罢了，在等着被送进坟墓。

他们旁边的桌子没人坐，甚至被看到离这种人太近也属不明智。他们都默不作声地坐着，面前是放了丁香的几杯杜松子酒，是这间咖啡馆的特制酒。三个人中，给温斯顿印象最深的是鲁瑟福的外貌。鲁瑟福一度是位著名的讽刺画家，他那一针见血的讽刺画在革命前和革命过程中起到了鼓动舆论的作用。即使在当时，《泰晤士报》每隔很长一段时间，仍会刊登一幅他所画的漫画，不过是对他早期风格的模仿，奇怪地缺乏活力，也没有说服力，总是对古老主题的炒冷饭：贫民窟的住户，饥饿的孩子，巷战，戴着高顶礼帽的资本家——甚至在街头防御工事里，那些资本家似乎仍坚持要戴高顶礼帽——他不断努力，想重振雄风，却毫无指望。他身材魁梧，一头浓密而油腻的花白头发，脸皮松驰，满是疤痕，嘴唇像黑人的那样厚。他肯定曾经健壮无比，但在当时，他庞大的躯体正在松弛着，歪斜着，发胀着，并向各个方向散架。他似乎正在别人的眼前碎裂，像一座山正在崩塌。

那是十五点的人少时间，温斯顿这时想不起来当时他怎么到了那间咖啡馆。里面几乎没什么人，电屏里播放着细细的音乐声，叮叮咚咚的。那三个人坐在角落几乎一动不动，从不说话。服务员又主动拿来几杯酒。他们旁边的桌子上有张棋盘，棋子已经摆好，但是没人下。然后可能总共才过了半分钟，电屏里又换播内容，播放的音乐调子变了，变成——难以形容，是种响脆、刺耳、嘲弄的音符，温斯顿在心里称之为预警调。接着，电屏里传出一个人在歌唱：



在绿荫如盖的栗子树下，

我背叛了你，你背叛了我。

他们躺在那儿，我们躺在这儿，

在绿荫如盖的栗子树下。



他们三个人一动也不动。温斯顿又看了一眼鲁瑟福那张破了相的脸庞，看到他眼眶里饱含泪水。他第一次看到艾朗森和鲁瑟福的鼻梁都被打断，他心里有种惊恐的感觉，却不知道自己为什么惊恐。

此后不久，他们三人再次被捕，似乎从上次被释放的那一刻起，他们马上开始了新的阴谋活动。在对他们的第二次审讯中，他们除了坦白所有旧的罪行，还坦白了一连串新的罪行。他们被处决，下场被写进党史以昭后世。差不多五年后，在一九七三年，温斯顿展开刚从气力输送管吹送到他桌子上的一团文件时，看到一小片报纸，显然和其他文件夹在一起，然后就被忘掉了。在将其展开的那一刻，他就意识到它的重要性。它是从约十年前的一期《泰晤士报》上撕下来的半页——是上半页，因此有日期——在这片报纸上，登了一张在纽约参加某个党务活动的代表团照片，在中间占据显著位置的是琼斯、艾朗森和鲁瑟福。绝不可能弄错，他们的名字还印在照片下方的说明中呢。

问题是两次审讯中，三个人都供认就在那一天，他们是在欧亚国的国土上。他们从位于加拿大的一个秘密机场飞到西伯利亚的某个接头地点，去跟欧亚国总参谋部的人会面，并向其泄露了重要的军事秘密。那个日期之所以印在温斯顿的脑海里，是因为那天刚好是夏至，而且这件事也会记录在无数文件中。只可能得出这样的结论：他们的坦白全是谎言。

当然，这件事本身称不上什么发现。甚至在当时，温斯顿也从未想象过清洗运动中被消灭了的人会真的犯下被指控的罪行。但这是件实实在在的证据，是被消灭了的过去的一个碎片，如同在某个地层出现了一块不该出现的骨化石，因此打破了一个地质学理论。如果能以某种方式将其公布于天下，并让人们明了其意义，就足以将党摧毁于无形。

他继续工作，一看到那张照片是什么及明白其意义何在，他马上用另外一张纸把它盖起来。幸好，他打开它时，从电屏的角度看来，它是上下颠倒的。

他把便条薄放在膝盖上并把椅子往后推，这样可以尽量离电屏远些。保持脸部无表情不难，努力一点，甚至也能控制住呼吸，但你无法控制心跳，而电屏已经灵敏到能够监听到心跳声。他度过了在他觉得有十分钟的时间，一直担心会发生什么事而备受煎熬，比如说突如其来的一阵过堂风，那会让他暴露。然后，他也没有将它再次打开，就把那张照片和别的废纸一起丢进了记忆洞。也许再过一分钟，它便会化作灰烬。

那是十年，不，十一年前的事了。也许他本来可以把那张照片保存到今天。奇怪的是，他用手拿过那张照片这件事实甚至到现在，对他来说似乎仍具意义，虽然那张照片本身及它所记录的事件都只是记忆。他想知道的是，因为一件存在过的证据不再一度存在过，党对过去的控制是不是没那么强了？

然而在今天，假如那张照片能从灰烬里复原，也可能根本不成其为证据。他发现那张照片时，大洋国已经不再是跟欧亚国打仗，那三个已死的人肯定是向东亚国的特务背叛自己国家。在那以后，战争的对象还有过变化——两次还是三次，他不记得了。很有可能的是，坦白材料被一再重写，直到原始事实和日期一点也不重要。过去不仅被篡改，而且是被持续篡改着。最让他受折磨、给他以噩梦般感觉的，是他从未明明白白理解为什么要进行这种大规模欺诈。伪造过去的直接好处显而易见，然而最重要的动机却秘不可知。他又捡起钢笔写道：



我明白怎么做，但是我不明白为什么。



像以前很多次一样，他琢磨起自己是不是个疯子。或许疯子只是种少数派。相信地球绕着太阳转曾被认为是疯子，到了今天，相信过去不可篡改会被认为是。他可能是独一无二地拥有这种信念，如果是独一无二，那他就是个疯子。但是想到自己是个疯子并没有让他很担心，可怕的是他的想法也有可能是错误的。

他捡起那本小孩用的历史课本，看着作为扉页的老大哥像。那双具有催眠力的眼睛在盯着他，好像有种极大的力量在将你往下压。某件物体进入你的头颅，在击打你的大脑，恐吓要你放弃自己的信念，也几乎是要说服你否认那些说明自己仍有判断力的证据。到最后，党会宣布二加二等于五，而你只能相信这一点。不可避免，他们迟早会这样声称，他们所在立场的逻辑要求他们这样做。不仅经验的正确性，而且客观现实的存在性本身，都被他们的哲学无声地否定。常识成了邪说中的邪说，但可怕的不是他们会因为你有另外的想法杀了你，而是他们有可能是对的。因为说到底，我们又怎么知道二加二等于四？要么重力在起作用吗？要么过去是不可篡改的吗？如果过去和外部世界只存在于头脑里，而思想本身可以控制——那又当如何？

但是不行！突然，他好像不由自主勇气大增。也没经过什么特意的联想，奥布兰的脸庞就浮现在他的脑海里。他知道——比以前更肯定地知道——奥布兰跟他立场一致。他在为奥布兰写日记，写给奥布兰，它像一封冗长的信，谁也不会读到，但它是写给某个特定的人，并因为这一点而文字生动起来。

党告诉你不要相信自己耳朵听到的以及眼睛看到的，这是他们最主要、最基本的命令。想到针对他的极大力量和党的知识分子能够轻而易举地驳倒他，他的心沉了下来。他无法理解那些高深的辩词，更不用说反驳。但他是对的一方！他们错了，而他是对的。一定要捍卫显而易见、质朴和真实的一切，不言而喻的就是真实的，在这一点上不可动摇！实体世界是存在的，其定律不可改变。石头是硬的，水是湿的，缺少支撑的物体会向地心方向坠落。怀着这种感觉，他是在向奥布兰说话，同时也在提出一条重要的公理。他写道：



自由就是说二加二等于四的自由。若此成立，其他同理。





第八章


从某条过道的尽头，飘来了烘咖啡的香味——是真正的咖啡，而不是胜利咖啡——它一直飘到了街道上。温斯顿不由自主停下脚步，在也许有两秒钟的时间里，他又回到了童年时生活过的那个世界，他已经快忘掉了。接着传来砰的一声关门声，那气味像声音一样，被生生截断了。

他已经顺着人行道走了几公里，他的静脉曲张溃疡处在跳着作痛。这已是他三个星期里的第二个晚上没去集体活动中心了，这是种轻率之举，因为可以肯定的是，会有人仔细查核你去活动中心的次数。从原则上说，党员不能有空闲时间，除了上床睡觉，他永远不会独自待着。按说他如果没在工作、吃饭或睡觉，就应该参加一种集体娱乐活动。做任何意味着想独处的事情，甚至一个人去散步这种事，总是略微具有危险性。新话里有个词：“自活”，指的就是这种行为，意味着个人主义和古怪。但这天傍晚走出真理部时，四月的和风让他动了心，天空之湛蓝比起那一年里无论什么时候他所看到的，都带了更多暖意，突然，在活动中心那漫长而嘈杂的夜晚、令人厌烦和精疲力竭的比赛、讲座、靠着喝酒勉强维持的同志关系等等似乎变得不可忍受。他心血来潮不去公共汽车站，而是漫步走进伦敦的迷宫，首先向南，然后向东，然后又向北，让自己迷失在不知名的街道上，几乎一点也不考虑往什么方向走。

“如果有希望，”温斯顿在日记里写过，“它就在群众身上。”他不时想起这句话，它陈述的是一项神秘的事实，但显而易见是荒谬的。他走到了原先是圣潘克拉斯火车站东北方向的某个地方，位于褐色的贫民窟。他走在一条铺鹅卵石的小街上，两旁都是低矮的两层楼房，破破烂烂的门口就开在人行道边，奇怪地给人以老鼠洞的感觉。鹅卵石街道上到处都有污水坑。数不清有多少人在黑暗的门道里进进出出，在街道两边的窄巷里也是——口红抹得土里土气、打扮得花枝招展的女孩，追女孩的小伙子，还有身体臃肿、蹒跚而行的妇女，她们会展示给你看那些女孩再过十年会长成什么样子，还有弯着腰的老人迈着八字步慢腾腾走路，衣衫褴缕的赤脚小孩子在污水坑里玩，然后在他们娘老子的怒喝中跑散开。那里可能有四分之一的窗户都是破的，用木板钉了起来。绝大多数人对温斯顿视而不见，只有几个人半是警惕半是好奇地看着他。两个身躯庞大的妇女在一处门口说着话，她们系着围裙，砖红色的手臂交叉在前面。温斯顿走近时，听到了她们谈话的只言片语。

“‘是了’，我对她说，‘一点儿不错，’我说，‘可要是你站在我的位置上，会跟我一样这么做。批评别人倒不难，’我说，‘可你是没遇到我这样的难题啊。’”

“啊，”另外那个女人说，“没错，就是这样，问题就在这儿。”

那两个尖嗓门突然停了下来，她们在温斯顿走过时，怀着敌意不出声盯着他看。但准确点说那并非敌意，而只是种警觉，片刻间的紧张而已，好像一头不为人熟悉的动物经过时那样。在这种街上，不会经常看到党员的蓝色工作服。确实，被人看到在这种地方属不明智之举，除非真的有事非来不可。不巧碰上巡逻队的话，有可能被拦下来。“可以看看您的证件吗，同志？您在这儿干什么？您什么时候下班的？这是您回家经常走的路吗？”——诸如此类的问话。并没什么规定不允许走一条不寻常的路回家，但如果被思想警察得知，这就足能引起他们的注意。

突然，整条街上一片骚动，到处传来警告的喊叫声，人们像兔子一样蹿进门道。一个年轻女人从门道里跳出来，把一个正在污水坑里玩耍的很小的小孩子一把拎起来用围裙包着，然后又跳回门道，动作为时极短，一气呵成。就在那时，一个身穿有很多折褶的黑色套装的男人从一条小巷里向温斯顿冲过来，激动地手指天空。

“汽船！”他叫道，“小心，先生！就在头顶！快趴下！”

“汽船”是群众给火箭弹起的绰号，原因不详。温斯顿迅速脸朝下趴在地上。群众向你提出这种警告时，几乎每一次都对。他们似乎拥有某种直觉，能在火箭弹到来前几秒钟感应到，尽管据说火箭弹的速度比声音快。温斯顿用手臂紧抱着头。传来一声轰鸣，似乎要把人行道掀起来，轻物如骤雨般砸在他背上。他起身时，发现距离最近的一扇窗户上震碎的玻璃渣落了他一身。

他继续往前走。炸弹炸毁了街道前方两百米远的一片房屋，一缕烟雾升腾到天上，烟雾之下，一团灰泥的尘雾笼罩着那片废墟，人们已经聚拢在那里。他前方的人行道上有一小堆灰泥，他能看到中间有一片鲜红的血迹。走近后，他看到那是只从腕部截断的人手。除了血肉模糊的断处，那只人手完全变成了白色，简直像是用石膏浇涛成的。

他把那东西踢进了阴沟，然后为了躲开人群，他转到右边的偏街上走。三四分钟后，他已经离开了受到炸弹影响的地带，而街头那种肮脏而拥挤的生活仍在继续进行，仿佛什么事情也没有发生。当时已经快到二十点，群众光顾的喝酒的地方（他们称之为“酒馆”）人满为患，从不停开合的脏乎乎的弹簧门那里，飘来了尿、锯末和酸啤酒的气味。在一处由房屋正面凸出来而形成的角落处，有三个人靠得很近地站在那里，中间一位举着一张对开的报纸，另两人在他边上看着。甚至在他走近得能看清他们的表情之前，温斯顿就能从他们身体的每个线条上看出他们正全神贯注。显然，他们在阅读一条重要新闻。离他们还有几步远时，三个人散开了，其中有两位很凶地吵了起来。有那么一阵子，他们看样子几乎要气炸了肺。

“你他妈能不能好好听我说？我告诉你，过去十四个月都没有末位是七的数字赢过了！”

“赢过！”

“没有，从来没赢过！我把过去两年的所有中奖数字都记在纸上，就在我家里放着呢。我全记下了，跟钟点一样一点儿不差。我还告诉你，没有哪个末位是七的数——”

“没错，末位是七的就是赢过了！我差不多能告诉你到底是哪个操蛋数字，末位要么是四要么是七，那是在二月份——二月里的第二个星期。”

“二月你个奶奶！我全白纸黑字写下来了。我告诉你，没有——”

“呸，你给我闭嘴吧！”第三个人说。

他们谈论的是彩票。温斯顿在走过有三十米远时，又回头看了他们一眼，他们还在脸红脖子粗地争论着。每周都会抽出巨奖的彩票是群众唯一真正关注的事。对于几百万群众来说，彩票即使不是活下去的唯一理由，也会是主要理由。彩票就是他们的欢乐、他们动的蠢念头、他们的安慰物以及智力刺激物。彩票问题上，就连勉强识得几个字的人，也好像能进行复杂的计算，而且记性好得令人咋舌。有一类人就单单靠卖中奖秘笈、预测及幸运符为生。温斯顿跟彩票经营没有一点关系，那由富足部操持，然而他明白（事实上每个党员都明白）所谓中奖，很大程度上是子虚乌有，只有很小数额才真的会发到中奖者手里，中大奖的都是子虚乌有的人。在大洋国内处处信息不畅的情况下，这也不难安排。

然而如果有希望，它就在群众身上，你必须坚信这一点。把这句话写下来时，听上去似乎合理，但是当你走在人行道上，看那些和你擦肩而过的人们时，相信这点就成了事关信仰之事。他转向的那条街是下坡路，他有种感觉以前来过这里附近，前面不远处是条主干道，从前面某个地方，传来了人声嘈杂的声音。那条街突然转了向，然后就到了头，尽头的台阶通向的是一条低凹的小巷，那里有几个摆摊的，在卖样子发蔫的蔬菜。这时，温斯顿记起了他身在何处。这条小巷通向的是一条大街，下个转弯处就是那间杂货店，他现在用作日记本的本子就是在那里买的。不远处还有家小文具店，他在那里买过笔杆和一瓶墨水。

他在台阶最高处停了一下。隔着小巷对面是间昏暗肮脏的小酒馆，窗玻璃上像是结了一层霜，其实只是落的灰尘。一个年纪很大、弓着腰然而行动敏捷的老头儿——他的白胡子虾须一样直直翘着——推开弹簧门走了进去。温斯顿站在那里看着他，他心想那个老头儿一定最少有八十岁，革命开始时他已经是中年了。他，还有为数不多的其他一些人，是和已经消失的资本主义世界之间仅存的联系纽带。在党自身内部，没几个人的观念是革命前就形成的。上一代人的绝大多数都在五六十年代的大清洗中被消灭了，幸存下来的极少数早就吓破了胆，思想上已经完全投降。如果还有哪个活着的人能向你真实说明本世纪早期的情况，那只可能是群众中的一员。突然，他又想起日记上抄自历史课本的那一段，他有了种疯狂的冲动，就是他可以进酒馆跟那个老头儿套近乎，然后询问他。温斯顿会问他：“跟我说说您还是个小孩子时，是怎么过日子的？那年头什么样？跟现在相比是好一点还是差一点呢？”

为了不让自己有时间畏缩，他走下台阶疾步穿过巷道。不用说，他是昏了头，照例没有白纸黑字的命令规定他们不可以跟群众说话或者光顾他们的酒馆，然而这种行为很难不被人注意到。巡逻队出现的话，他可以声称是突然感到头晕，不过他们大概不会相信。他推开门，一股极为难闻的酸啤酒气味扑面而来。他走进去时，那一片嘈杂的说话声降低了一半，他不用看也能感觉到每个人都在盯着他的蓝色工作服，室内那头正在玩飞镖的人们停手有半分钟之久。他跟着进来的那个老头儿坐在吧台那里，正在为什么事跟酒保吵架。酒保是个大块头的结实小伙子，小臂极粗，有一群人手持酒杯看着他们争吵。

“我问你问得够礼貌的了，是不是？”老头儿气冲冲地挺着肩膀说，“你是说这个操蛋的小酒馆里没有一品脱的杯子？”

“品脱到底他妈的是个什么词儿？”酒保的指尖撑在柜台上，身子往前倾着说。

“听听他说的是啥！还自称酒保呢，可是不知道什么叫品脱！一品脱嘛，就是半夸脱，四夸脱是一加仑。下次还非得从一、二、三教你呢。”

“从来没听说过，”酒保说，“一升，半升——我们就按这两样卖。你面前的架子上有杯子。”

“我就喜欢要一品脱，”老头儿坚持道，“你甭想那么容易让我不说品脱了，我年轻那会儿根本没这么操蛋地论升卖。”

“你年轻那会儿我们还在树上住呢。”酒保说着扫了一眼其他人。

这句话引起一阵哄堂大笑，温斯顿进来时造成的不自在感好像不复存在。老头儿布满胡茬的白脸膛涨得通红，他嘴里嘟嘟囔囔地转过身去，撞到了温斯顿身上，温斯顿轻轻抓住他的手臂。

“我可以请您喝一杯吗？”他说。

“你是个绅士。”老头儿说着又把肩膀挺起来。他好像没注意到温斯顿穿的蓝工作服。“品脱！”他挑衅地向酒保说，“一品脱汽酒。”

酒保把玻璃杯在柜台下面的水桶里洗了一下，利索地把两半升深棕色啤酒倒了进去。啤酒是在群众光顾的酒馆里能喝到的唯一一种酒类。按说群众不准喝杜松子酒，但其实很容易就能搞到。飞镖游戏又热热闹闹地玩了起来，吧台边的一群人又谈论起彩票，温斯顿的在场暂时被忘掉了。窗户下方有张木桌，他和老头儿可以坐在那里交谈而不用担心被别人听到。这种事情危险之至，但不管怎么说室内没有电屏，这一点，是他刚踏进来时就查看清楚了的。

“他甭想让我不说品脱了。”老头儿在桌子前坐下来时，还在发牢骚，酒杯就摆在他面前。“半升不够，不过瘾。一升又太多，让我老是想尿尿，更不用说还有价钱。”

“从年轻那会儿到现在，您肯定经历了不少变化。”温斯顿试探着说。

老头儿的淡蓝色眼睛从飞镖靶扫到吧台，又从吧台扫到男厕所门，好像他希望在这间吧屋里找到有什么变化。

“啤酒比以前好喝了，”他最后说，“而且更便宜了！我年轻那会儿，淡啤酒——我们以前叫它汽酒——是四便士一品脱。当然，那是在战前了。”

“是哪次战争？”温斯顿说。

“一直在打仗。”老头儿含糊地说。他拿起酒杯，又一次挺起了肩膀。“我祝你身体无比健康！”

他的尖喉结在瘦瘦的喉部奇怪地上下快速抖动，啤酒就消失了。温斯顿走到吧台那里又拿了两个半升过来。老头儿好像忘了他对喝一升啤酒的成见。

“您比我年长许多，”温斯顿说，“我出生时您肯定已经是个成年人了，您记得以前的日子怎么样，也就是在革命前。像我这样年纪的人对那时候可以说一点儿都不了解，只能从书上读到，不过书上写的可能不是真的，我想听听您是怎么说的。历史书上说革命前的日子跟现在完全不同，当时有着最严重的压迫、不公平和贫困——远远超出我们的想象。在伦敦这儿，绝大多数人从生下来到死去，从来填不饱肚子，他们中间有一半人甚至没靴子穿，一天要工作十二个小时，九岁就离开学校，一间屋住十个人。同时有很少人，只有几千个——就是被称为资本家的——他们有钱有势，拥有可以拥有的一切，住华美无比的房屋，有三十个仆人。他们坐着汽车和四匹马拉的马车到处去，喝香槟，戴高顶礼帽——”

老头儿突然高兴起来。

“高顶礼帽！”他说，“真有趣你会提起那个。我昨天才想到那玩意儿，也不知道为啥。我还在想有好多年没见过高顶礼帽了呢，影子都见不着。我最后一次戴高顶礼帽是在我嫂子的葬礼上。那是在——唉，我说不出来确切是哪一年，但肯定是五十年前了。当然，是专门为那次葬礼租来的，你也知道。”

“高顶礼帽并不是很重要，”温斯顿耐心地说，“问题是，这些资本家——他们还有依靠他们生活的律师和牧师之类的人——是地球上的主人，一切都是为了他们的利益而存在。你们——普通人，工人们——是他们的奴隶，他们可以对你们为所欲为，可以把你们当做牛一样运到加拿大，想和你们的女儿睡觉就睡觉，可以叫人拿一种叫九尾鞭的东西抽打你们。遇到他们时，您必须把帽子摘下来。每个资本家都有一群仆从，他们——”

老头儿突然又高兴起来。

“仆从！”他说，“这个词我可很久没听说过了。仆从！它总让我想起从前，没错。我记得，噢，那是很多年前的事了，我经常在星期天下午去海德公园听那些家伙演讲，救世军，罗马天主教，犹太人，印度人——就是那些事。有个家伙——唉，我叫不上来他的名字，不过是个很有能耐的演讲家，他真的是。他骂起他们可是一点儿也不客气！‘走狗们！’他说，‘布尔乔亚的仆从们！统治阶级的走狗们！’寄生虫——那是另外一个用词，还有豺狼——他肯定称过他们是豺狼。当然，他指的是工党，你也明白。”

温斯顿有种感觉他们在各说各的，答非所问。

“我真正想知道的是这个，”他说，“您有没有感觉跟过去比起来，现在有了更多自由？您现在是不是更被当做一个人来对待？在过去，富人，高高在上的人们——”

“贵族院。”老头儿怀旧般插话道。

“随您怎么称呼吧。我问的是，那些人能不能就因为他们富裕，就把您看得低人一等？比如说，跟他们打照面时，您是不是真的必须取下帽子叫他们‘先生’？”

老头儿似乎在沉思，开口回答前，他喝掉了杯子里四分之一的啤酒。

“对，”他说，“他们喜欢你为他们碰一碰帽子，那表示尊敬，差不多吧。我自己不愿意那样做，我是说我自己，不过我也那样做了很多次。非得这样，可以这么说。”

“那种事是不是经常发生——我只是引用我在历史书上读到的——也就是那些人跟他们的仆人是不是经常把您从人行道上推进阴沟？”

“有个推过我一次，”老头儿说，“就像是昨天的事，所以我记着呢。是划船比赛(1)那天晚上——划船比赛那天晚上人们经常会闹得很厉害——我在夏夫兹伯里大街上撞到一个小伙子身上。他很有点绅士的样子，他真的是——礼服衬衫，高顶礼帽，黑大衣。他在人行道上有点儿歪歪斜斜地走着，我好像是没注意撞到他身上。他说：‘你干吗不看路？’他说。我说：‘你他妈以为你买下了整条人行道吗？’他说：‘再跟我啰唆我把你他妈的脖子给拧下来。’我说：‘你喝醉了，待会儿再跟你算帐。’我说。我可没胡说，他用手在我胸口推了一把，差点儿把我推到公共汽车轮子底下。我当时也是年轻气盛，正要给他来一下，只是——”

温斯顿陷入一种无助感。老头儿的记忆里只记得陈谷子烂芝麻的琐碎事情，你可以问他一整天，也问不到什么东西。从某种意义上说，党的历史仍然正确，有可能完全正确。他最后又试了一次。

“也许我没能说清楚，”他说，“我想说的是这个：您已经活了很大岁数，一半时间都是在革命前过的。比如说在一九二五年，您已经成年了。根据您所记得的，能不能说一九二五年的生活比现在要好一些还是坏一些呢？要是您能选择，您宁愿活在那个时代还是现在？”

老头儿沉思着看了一眼飞镖靶。他喝光了啤酒，喝的速度比以前慢了些。他再次说话时，似乎有了种万事可忍、哲学家般的神色，似乎啤酒让他更稳重了一些。

“我知道你指望我说什么，”他说，“你指望我说要不了多久，我就会再次年轻。大多数人被问到时，会说他们最想返老还童。年轻时，身体又好，又有力气，可要是你到了我这把年纪，你在各方面都不会很好了。我脚有毛病，膀胱更是要命，天天夜里上六七趟厕所。另外呢，当个老头儿也有很大好处，你不会再为同样的事儿操心了。不用跟女人纠缠了，这还不赖。我快三十年时间没碰过女人了，也许你觉得这算不简单。再说我也不想。”

温斯顿靠着窗台坐着。再问下去也没用。他正要再去多买些啤酒，老头儿站了起来，拖着脚步很快走到室内那头臭烘烘的小便处。多喝的半升啤酒已经在他身上起了作用。温斯顿在那里多坐了一两分钟，眼睛盯着他的空玻璃杯，几乎没留意到是什么时候，他的双脚又带着他走上了街道。他心想，最多再过二十年，那个最突出也是最简单的问题——“革命前的生活是不是比现在更好？”——就永远成为无法回答的问题了。但实际上甚至在现在，就已经是无法回答的了，因为对从遥远的旧时代遗留下来的少数散居着的幸存者而言，他们没有能力把一个时代同另一个做比较。他们记得上百万件无用的事情，例如跟一个工友的吵架，寻找丢了的自行车打气筒，一个死去很久的妹妹的表情，七十年前某个刮风的冬日早晨那卷着灰尘的旋风等等，却看不到相关的事实。他们就像蚂蚁，只看到小的，看不到大的。在记忆已经失灵、文字记录被伪造时——在这些事情发生时，就只能接受党所声称的人们的生活状况已经得到提高，因为没有可资参照的标准，那种标准现在既不存在，以后也永远不会再有。

这时，他的思绪突然停下来，他停下脚步张望了一下。他是在一条窄窄的街道上，几间光线阴暗的小铺子杂处于居民房屋中。就在他头顶上，吊着三个掉了颜色的金属球(2)，看样子好像曾经镀过金，他好像知道那里。没错！他正好在一间杂货店的外面，他在那里买过日记本。

一阵恐惧感掠过他的心头。买那个本子的行为本身已经够不慎重了，而且他也发过誓永远不再来这里附近，然而他让自己的思想信马由缰时，他的双脚却自动将他带回这个地方。他之所以开始记日记，就是为了防止自己做出这种自取灭亡式的一时冲动行为。同时，他注意到当时虽然已经快二十一点，那间铺子却仍开着。他觉得与其在外面流连，倒不如走进去而少招人注意。他走进铺门，要是被盘问，他可以说是来买剃须刀片的，听着还像回事。

铺主刚点亮一盏悬挂着的油灯，它散发出一股虽然不洁，但不算刺鼻的气味。他也许有六十岁，身材单薄，弯腰弓背，鼻子长长的，给人以和蔼之感，厚厚的眼镜片折射着和善的眼神。他的头发几乎全白，眉毛却依然浓密，仍是黑色。他的眼镜，他轻手轻脚、小心翼翼的举动以及他身穿黑色丝绒旧夹克这几方面，都让他模模糊糊有种睿智的样子，像个搞文学的，或者音乐家。他的话音柔和，似乎很憔悴，而他的口音跟大多数群众比起来，没那么土里土气。

“您还在人行道上我就认出您了，”他马上说，“您是来买过小姐用记事本的那位先生。那种纸可真漂亮，真的。白条纸(3)，以前是这么叫的。现在已经不生产了——噢，我敢说有五十年没再生产了。”他从眼镜架上方瞄了一眼温斯顿，“您具体还想要点儿什么？要么您只是随便看看？”

“我路过这儿，”温斯顿含糊地说，“只是进来看看，没想专门要买什么。”

“也好，”那个铺主说，“因为我估计也没办法让您买到合适的东西。”他做了个抱歉的手势，他的掌心是绵软的。“您也看到是怎样的了，一间空铺子，可以这么说吧。这话我只跟您说，古董生意差不多算是到头了。没人买，也没存货了。家具，瓷器，玻璃——全慢慢坏掉了。当然，金属东西绝大多数都被回炉了，我好多年一件铜制蜡烛座也没见过。”

铺子里很小的空间竟然塞得满满的，让人不便走动，然而里面几乎没有一件值上一点小钱。地板上的地方很挤，因为靠墙一圈堆着不计其数的画框。橱窗里有一碟一碟的螺钉螺母，豁了刃的铅笔刀，看起来根本不能走的失去光泽的手表，还有其他各种各样的无用物件。只是墙角那里的一张小桌子上面，有一堆杂七杂八的小玩意儿——上了漆的鼻烟壶、玛瑙胸针之类——里面也许有些有意思的东西。温斯顿朝那张桌子走去时，他的眼睛被一个圆圆的、表面光滑的东西所吸引，它在灯光下幽幽发亮。他把它捡了起来。

那是块很重的玻璃，一面圆，一面平，几乎是个半球。那块玻璃在颜色和质地上，有种独特的柔和之感，像雨水那样。中心位置，有片被弧面放大的奇特东西，颜色是粉红色，形状复杂，能让人联想到玫瑰花或者海葵。

“这是什么？”温斯顿很着迷地问道。

“那是珊瑚，就是里面的，”那个老头儿说，“肯定来自印度洋，他们把它嵌进玻璃里面，制造时间会在一百多年前，不过从样子看，还要更早些。”

“是件漂亮的东西。”温斯顿说。

“是件漂亮的东西。”那个老头儿赞赏地说，“不过现在没几样东西可以这么形容了。”他咳嗽了一下。“这么着吧，您想买的话，给我四块钱就行了。我记得像这种东西，以前能卖到八镑，八镑是——唉，我算不出来了，但会是很多钱。可是如今谁又关心真正的古董？再说也没多少古董留下来了。”

温斯顿马上掏给他四元钱，把他看上的那样东西揣进口袋。它之所以吸引他，并非因为它有多漂亮，而更在于它好像拥有那种外观，属于跟如今这个时代很不相同的某个时代。那种颜色柔和、雨水般的玻璃跟他见过的任何玻璃都不一样。这件东西特别吸引人的，是它显然毫无用处，不过他猜想以前肯定是当镇纸用。它放在口袋里很重，但幸好还没让他的口袋显得太鼓鼓囊囊。对党员来说，拥有这样一件东西是奇怪的，甚至可以说是不正当，凡是旧的乃至漂亮的东西，总多少会令人生疑。老头儿收到四元钱后，显然情绪更好些了，温斯顿意识到给他三元甚至两元他都会接受。

“楼上还有个房间您可能愿意看看，”“里面没多少东西，他说，只有几件。我们一起上楼的话，可以拿盏灯。”

他又点亮一盏灯，弯着腰慢慢在前面带路。走上陡峭破烂的楼梯后是一段狭窄的过道，然后进了一个房间，它不对着街边，而对着一个铺鹅卵石的院子和一片烟囱丛林。温斯顿注意到里面的家具摆放得仍像有人住的样子。地上铺了一小片地毯，墙上挂着一两幅画，还有把又脏又破的高背扶手椅顶住壁炉放着。一架老式玻璃面时钟在壁炉台上嘀嘀嗒嗒走着，钟面分为十二格。窗户下边，一张很大的床占据了快四分之一的房间面积，床上还有床垫。

“我太太死之前我们一直住在这儿，”老头儿不无歉意地说，“我在一件一件卖家具。那是张漂亮的红木床，或者说至少把上面的臭虫弄干净后算得上吧，不过我想您会觉得它有点儿太笨重了。”

他把灯高举着，好照亮整个房间。在温暖的暗淡灯光下，那个房间看上去奇怪得令人向往。温斯顿的脑海里掠过一个想法，就是敢冒险的话，他大概可以一星期花几元钱租下这里。这是种不可能实现的离谱想法，他刚想到就放弃了。但那个房间在他心里唤起一种怀旧的念头，一种年代久远的记忆。坐在那样一个房间里会有什么感觉，他好像完全明白：坐在熊熊炉火前的扶手椅里，脚放在壁炉挡板上，搁架上还有把烧水的壶——那是种绝对独处、绝对安全的感觉，没人监视你，没有声音缠着你，除了烧水壶的响声和时钟悦耳的嘀嗒声，没有别的声响。

“没有电屏！”他忍不住低声说。

“啊，”“我这儿从来没那种东西。太贵，老头儿说，不管怎么说，我好像从来没觉着需要装那个。您看那边的墙角还有张不错的折叠桌，不过您要是想用边上的桌板，当然得换上新合页。”

另外一个墙角那里有个小书架，吸引温斯顿走过去，上面只有几本垃圾书。在群众居住的地方，对书本的查抄和销毁做得同样彻底。在大洋国内，几乎不可能找到一本印刷于一九六零年以前的书。老头儿仍然用手举着灯，站在一幅带蔷薇木画框的画前，它挂在壁炉一侧，正对着床。

“喏，您要是刚好对旧版画感兴趣——”他小心翼翼地说。

温斯顿走过去细看那幅画。那是一幅钢雕版版画，画的是一座椭圆形建筑物，有着长方形的窗户，前方还有座小塔。那座建筑的周围还有栏杆，在它后面，还有似乎是一座雕像之类的东西。温斯顿盯着它看了一会儿，他对之似曾相识，但不记得有那座雕像。

“画框钉在墙上，”老头儿说，“不过当然我可以给您取下来。”

“我知道那座建筑，”温斯顿过了很久才说，“现在都成废墟了，它在正义宫外面的街道上。”

“没错，就在法院外面。它是在——噢，好多年前被炸掉了。它曾经是一座教堂，名叫圣克莱门特教堂。”他抱歉地笑了笑，像是意识到自己说了什么有点荒诞不经的东西，他又说，“‘桔子和柠檬。’圣克莱门特教堂的大钟说。”

“什么？”温斯顿问道。

“噢，‘“桔子和柠檬。”圣克莱门特教堂的大钟说。’那是我们小时候念的押韵诗。往下的我不记得了，不过我确实还记得结尾：‘这儿有支蜡烛照着你去睡觉，这儿有把斧头把你的头剁掉。’是跳舞时唱的。别人把胳膊抬高让你穿过去，唱到‘这儿有把斧头把你的头剁掉’时，他们胳膊往下压就把你卡住了。只是一些教堂的名字，伦敦所有的教堂都唱到了——也就是所有主要的教堂。”

温斯顿茫然想着教堂是属于哪一世纪的。要想确定伦敦的建筑物是哪个时代的总是不容易，凡是令人赞叹的大型建筑物，如果其外貌差不多够新，都会自动被声称建于革命之后，而凡是显然建于很久以前的，都会被归类建于被称为中世纪的黑暗时代。资本主义的几个世纪被认为未能产生任何有价值的东西。人们从建筑上学到的历史不会比从书本上学到的更多。雕像，铭文，纪念牌，街道名——一切可能揭示过去的都被有系统地更改了。

“我从来不知道它以前是教堂。”他说。

“有很多留了下来，真的。”老头儿说，“不过被用作其他用途了。哎，那首押韵诗是怎么念的？啊，我想起来了！



‘桔子和柠檬。’圣克莱门特教堂的大钟说，

‘你欠我三个法寻(4)。’圣马丁教堂的大钟说——



喏，我记得的就这么多了。一法寻，那是种小铜币，看上去跟一分钱有点像。”

“圣马丁教堂在哪儿？”温斯顿问道。

“圣马丁教堂？它还在，在胜利广场，跟画廊在一块儿。就是前面有三角形柱廊，台阶很高的那幢建筑。”

温斯顿很熟悉那里。它是个博物馆，用来展览各种各样宣传性东西——火箭弹和水上堡垒的缩微模型、展示敌人残暴行为的蜡像造型等等诸如此类的东西。

“它以前叫做田野里的圣马丁教堂，”老头儿补充道，“不过我不记得那儿附近有什么田野。”

温斯顿没买那幅画，它是比那块玻璃镇纸更不合适拥有的东西，而且不可能拿回家，除非把它从画框上取下来。但他仍然多逗留了几分钟跟老头儿说话，得知他的名字不叫威克斯——人们有可能根据从铺子门面处的题字作此推论——而是查林顿。查林顿先生似乎是个鳏夫，年纪为六十三岁，住在那间铺子里已有三十年。这三十年里，他一直想把橱窗上的名字改过来，但从未着手去做。他们谈话时，温斯顿的心里一直想着那首记得不清不楚的押韵诗。桔子和柠檬，圣克莱门特教堂的大钟说。你欠我三个法寻，圣马丁教堂的大钟说！说来奇怪，可是对自己念一念时，会有幻觉，似乎真的听到了钟声，那钟声属于失去的伦敦，然而那个伦敦仍在此处彼处存在着，被改头换面，也被遗忘了。从一个又一个鬼影般的尖塔那里，他似乎听到钟声在洪亮地鸣响。但就记忆所及，他在现实生活中从未听到过教堂钟声。

他告别查林顿先生，独自走下楼梯，好不让这个老头儿看到他迈步出门前，还要先察看一下街道。他已经打好主意，再过一段适当间隔——比如说一个月——他会冒险再来这间铺子看一看。那也许比开小差不去集体活动中心更危险，单是买过日记本后，不知道那个铺主是否可以信赖，就又再来第二趟已经够蠢的了，然而——！

对，他又想，他会再回来。他会再买一些美丽然而无用的东西。他会买下那幅圣克莱门特教堂的版画，把它从画框上取下来，藏在工作服的上衣里带回家。他会从查林顿先生的记忆里挖掘出那首诗的剩下部分。甚至租下楼上房间的疯狂念头也再次闪现在他脑海。也许有五分钟时间，兴奋感让他疏忽大意了，他没有先隔着橱窗往外看一看，就跨上人行道。他甚至即兴唱了起来：



“桔子和柠檬。”圣克莱门特教堂的大钟说，

“你欠我三个法寻。”圣马丁——



突然，他感到五内俱寒，魂飞天外。一个身穿蓝色工作服的人影正沿着人行道走过来，那时离他不到十米远。是小说司那个女孩，长着黑头发的。天色正在变暗，然而仍能毫不困难地认出她来。她在直直盯着他的脸看，然后又继续快步走着，似乎没看到过他。

有那么几秒钟，温斯顿吓得不能动脚。然后他向右转，脚步沉重地走开了，也暂时没注意到他走错了路。不管怎样，有个问题算是得到了澄清，那个女孩在监视他，这完全不再有疑问。她一定是跟踪他到这里的，因为如果说她在同一天晚上，来到离党员所住地方有几公里远的同样一条无名小街上是碰巧，那就让人无法相信，说是巧合就太离谱了。不管她是否真的是个思想警察的特务，或者只是个由好管闲事心理驱使的业余侦探，根本说来，那都无关紧要。她在监视他这一点就够了，也许她也看到他进去过那个酒馆。

走路很费劲。每走一步，口袋里那块玻璃都撞击他的大腿，他有点想把它掏出来扔掉。最糟糕的是他觉得肚子里难受。有那么几分钟，他觉得如果不能马上找到一间厕所，他就会死掉，但在这种地段没有公共厕所。后来阵痛过去了，留下了隐隐的痛感。

那条小街是条死胡同。温斯顿停住脚步，站立了几秒钟，茫然想着该怎么办，然后他转身沿原路返回。转过身后，他心里突然想到那个女孩仅在三分钟前跟他擦肩而过，要是跑步，也许能追上她。他可以尾随她，一直到僻静地方，然后拿一块鹅卵石砸烂她的脑袋，口袋里那块玻璃也够重，可以一用。但他马上放弃了这个想法，因为想一想就需要气力，也不可忍受。他跑不动，也没法砸她，再说她年轻而且活力充沛，能够自卫。他也想快些到集体活动中心去，然后待在那里直到关门，以此作为那天晚上不在别处的部分证据。但那也是不可能，一种要命的倦怠感控制了他，他只想尽快回到家里坐下安静一会儿。

他回到公寓时已经过了二十二点，二十三点半总闸就会被关掉。他走进厨房吞下了差不多一茶杯胜利杜松子酒。然后走向浅凹处的那张桌子，坐下来并从抽屉里拿出日记本，但他没有马上打开它。电屏里传出一个粗嗓门女声，在哇里哇拉地唱一首爱国歌曲。他坐在那里，眼睛盯着日记本的大理石纹封面，想对那声音充耳不闻，却做不到。

他们会在夜里来抓你，总是在夜里。正确的做法是在他们来抓你之前自我了断，无疑有些人正是这样做的，许多失踪事件其实都是自杀。然而在全然无望得到枪支以及任何速效万灵毒药的世界上，自我了断需要极大勇气。他有点震惊地想到，疼痛和恐惧在生物学上完全无用。就在需要做出某一动作时，身体总是变得失去活动能力，从而背叛了自己。如果动手动得够快，他也许能把那个黑发女孩干掉，然而恰恰因为所处的极度危险境地，他失去了行动的力量。他突然想到，一个人在遭遇危机时，要与之斗争的，总不是外部敌人，而总是自己的身体。即使是现在，即使喝了酒，腹部的隐痛仍让他不可能进行连贯的思考。他意识到在所有表面上是英勇或者悲剧性的情况下总是如此。在战场上，在刑讯室，或者在一条正下沉的船上，你与之斗争的事情总是被忘却了，因为躯体方面成了重要的问题，直到最后成了唯一重要的问题。即使你没被吓瘫或者痛苦地号叫，生活仍是跟饥饿或寒冷或失眠一刻不停地斗争，还有跟胃酸或牙疼斗争。

他打开日记本，重要的是记下什么。电屏里的女声开始唱一首新歌，她的声音像有尖茬的碎玻璃片一样，插进了他的脑子。他努力回忆奥布兰的模样，日记是为他而写，或者说就是写给他的，然而他开始想象思想警察把他抓走后，他将遇到什么。如果他们马上处死他倒没关系，被处死属意料之中，但在死之前（没人说起过这些事，不过谁都清楚）一定要遍尝坦白时不可避免的一切：匍匐在地板上尖叫饶命，骨头被打断，牙齿被打落，头发一缕缕被鲜血染红。

既然总是同样结果，又何必非要承受这一切？为何不可能把你的生命缩短几天或者几星期？从未有人躲过侦察，从未有人不坦白。你控制不住犯了思想罪时，可以肯定的是某一天你必将被处死，然而为何那种什么都改变不了的极度恐惧非要在未来等候着？

他又试着想起奥布兰的样子，这次成功了一点。“我们会在没有黑暗的地方见面。”奥布兰对他说过这种话。他知道这句话的意思，或者说自以为知道。没有黑暗的地方就是想象中的未来，人们永远看不到，然而如果有先见之明，就能神秘地分享到未来。因为从电屏传来的声音在他耳边聒噪着，他无法顺着那个思路往下想。他抽出一根烟噙到嘴上，一半烟丝立即掉到他舌头上，那是种难以吐出的苦涩尘土。老大哥的面庞浮现在他脑海中，取代了奥布兰的脸庞。像前几天所做，他从口袋里掏出一枚硬币看着它。那张脸往上盯着他，凝重，平静，警觉，然而在两撇黑色八字胡后，隐藏的是什么样的微笑？像个沉重的不祥之兆，他又看到那几句话：



战争即和平

自由即奴役

无知即力量

第二部





第一章


这天上午过了一半时，温斯顿离开小隔间去上厕所。

从亮堂堂的长走廊那头，一个人影正向他走来，是那个黑头发女孩。自从那天晚上在杂货铺外面遇到她以来，已经过了四天。她走近时，温斯顿看到她的右臂挂着吊带，吊带跟她工作服的颜色一样，所以从远处看不出来。她大概是在转动某台大型搅拌机时压伤了手，小说的情节就是在那种搅拌机里“拟出初稿”的。在小说司，这是种常见事故。

他们相距也许有四米远时，那个女孩脚下绊了一下，几乎是趴着摔倒了，并发出一声痛苦的尖叫，肯定是摔倒时把受伤的胳膊压到了身子底下。温斯顿马上停下脚步。那个女孩已跪起身子，她的脸变成了奶黄色，衬托之下，她的嘴唇显得更为红润。她在盯着他的眼睛看，她哀婉的表情看上去与其说像是出于疼痛，倒不如说是出于恐惧。

温斯顿的心里涌起一种奇特的情感。在他面前，是想置他于死地的敌人，但也是个活生生的人，由于骨折，正身受疼痛。他不由自主往前走一步想帮助她，看到她跌倒并压在那只缠了绷带的手臂上时，他似乎也感到了疼痛。

“您受伤了吗？”他问道。

“没关系，只是胳膊疼，马上就没事儿了。”

她说话的语气似乎她的内心很激动，面色绝对变得很苍白。

“您没跌伤哪儿吗？”

“没有，我没事儿。这会儿疼，不要紧。”

她向温斯顿伸出没打吊带的左手，他拉着她站了起来。她的气色恢复了一点，看上去好多了。

“没关系，”她很快又重复道，“也就是手腕砸了一下。同志，谢谢您！”

她说完就顺着原先走的方向继续走开，走得一样轻快，似乎真的一点事也没有，整件事前后不过半分钟。不在脸上流露出表情已成了本能般的习惯，再说这件事发生时，他们正好站在电屏前，然而不流露出片刻惊讶仍然很困难，因为在他拉着那个女孩的手帮她站起身的两三秒内，她往他手里塞了一样什么东西，毫无疑问，她是故意那样做的。那是个又小又平的东西，走过厕所门时，他把它转移到了口袋里，用指尖摸着它。那是个折成四方形状的纸片。

站在小便池前时，他还是用手指摸索着把它展开了。显然上面写着什么信息。有那么一阵子，他忍不住想把它拿进一间厕格马上看看写的是什么，但那会是种蠢不可及的行为，他也很明白，比起别的地方，可以更有把握认为厕格里是一刻不停被监视着的。

他回到自己的小隔间坐了下来，随随便便把那张纸片跟别的纸片放在一起，然后戴上眼镜并把口述记录器拉向自己。“五分钟，”他对自己说，“至少要等五分钟！”他的心脏在胸膛里可怕地扑通扑通跳动着，幸好他要做的工作只是一般性的，也就是改正一大串数字，不需要特别专心。

不管那片纸上写的是什么，它一定具有政治意义。就他所能想到的，有两种可能，第一种可能性最大，就是那个女孩是思想警察的特务，正如他担心的那样。他不明白思想警察怎么会选择以这种方式通知，但可能他们自有理由。纸上写的可能是个警告，一个传唤令，要求他自杀的命令，某种陷阱，都有可能。然而还有另外一种可能总出现在他脑子里，更离谱一些，他想把它压下，却总归徒劳。这一可能，就是那张便条根本不是来自思想警察，而来自某个地下组织。也许到底存在着兄弟会！也许那个女孩就是其中之一！毫无疑问，这个想法荒诞不经，但在他摸到手里那片纸的一刻，他脑子里就冒出了这一想法。几分钟之后，他才想到更接近事实的另一解释。即使是现在，虽然他的理智告诉他那张便条可能意味着死亡——然而他仍不相信，他不切实际的希望欲罢不能，心脏也在剧烈跳动。他对着口述记录器低声说话时，尽力控制住自己，不让声音发颤。

他卷起已经完成的一叠工作材料投进了气力输送管，已经过去了八分钟。他推了推鼻子上的眼镜，叹了口气，然后把另外一堆工作材料拉过来，那片纸就在最上面。他展平它，在上面，用很大的不规则字体写着：



我爱你。



有那么几秒钟时间，他震惊得甚至没把这种足以定罪的东西扔进记忆洞。他真的往里面扔时，虽然很明白表现出太大兴趣是危险的，但还是忍不住又看了一眼，只是为了肯定上面写的确实是这几个字。

在这天上午剩余的时间里，他很难专心工作，比不得不专心干那些琐碎工作更难做到的，是掩饰自己的激动心情不让电屏看到。他感到腹内犹如火烧。去热气腾腾、人头涌动、声音嘈杂的食堂里吃午餐成了件折磨人之事。他希望午餐时间独自待一会儿，可倒霉的是那个蠢货帕森斯又蹿过来坐到他旁边，他身上那股刺鼻的汗味几乎盖过了炖菜的铁皮味，他还在滔滔不绝地说着为仇恨周作准备的事。他对于一座老大哥的纸制头像的事特别热心，头像的直径有两米宽，是他女儿所在的侦察队中队专门为仇恨周制作的。令人恼火的是，在喧闹嘈杂的说话声中，他几乎听不见帕森斯在说什么，所以要不时请他重复他那愚蠢的话语。他仅仅看到过那个女孩一次，是跟另外两个女孩在食堂那头的一张桌子前。她好像没看到他，他也没再往那个方向看。

下午还好过一些。午餐时间一结束，就来了件棘手的复杂工作，要费上几个小时来做，而且需要将别的所有事情都放一边。此项工作包括伪造一系列两年前的生产报道，以此来归罪于一个如今失了宠的内党要人。这种事情是温斯顿擅长做的，在超过两小时时间里，他成功地将那个女孩完全置于脑后。接着她的脸庞又出现在他的记忆里，随之而来的，是种不可忍受的强烈渴望，想独自待着。除非他能这样，否则不可能琢磨透这种新情况。这天晚上他要在集体活动中心度过，在狼吞虎咽地又吃了食堂里一餐无味的饭后，他赶紧去了活动中心，参加了看似严肃、其实愚蠢的“讨论组”，玩了两局乒乓球，喝了几杯酒，听了半小时名为“英社与象棋”的讲座。他心里烦得要命，但是他第一次没有冲动想躲掉在活动中心度过一晚上。看到“我爱你”那几个字时，他心里涌起了活下去的渴望，去冒些小险的想法突然似乎是愚蠢的了。直到二十一点，当他已经回到家里并躺到床上时——在黑暗里，只要保持不出声，你甚至可以不受电屏的监控——他才能进行连贯的思考。

有个需要解决的实际问题：怎样跟那个女孩安排一次会面。他不再考虑她可能是为他设下陷阱的问题，他知道没这种可能，因为在递给他纸条时，她无疑情绪激动，显然已经吓得六神无主，对她来说这亦在情理之中。他根本没想过拒绝她的主动。仅仅五天前的晚上，他还想拿块鹅卵石砸烂她脑袋呢，不过那不重要。他想起她那赤条条、朝气蓬勃的年轻躯体，正像梦中所见。他曾把她想象成和别人一样的蠢货，脑袋里塞满了谎言和仇恨，长着一副铁石心肠。想到可能失去她时，他陷入一种狂热的感情，那具白色而年轻的躯体可能从他身边溜走！他最担心的是，如果不尽快跟她联系上，她可能改变主意。但是安排见面的具体困难太大，就像下象棋时，在已被将死的情况下再走一步。不管转向哪里，电屏总是面对着你。实际上，他读过那张纸条后的五分钟内，就想到了能跟她取得联系的所有办法。在有时间思考的此时，他再次想了个遍，如同把一排工具摊放在桌子上。

显然，像上午那种路遇不能再来一次。她也在档案司工作的话，问题还可能相对简单些，但温斯顿对小说司在楼上哪一层只有很模糊的印象，而且没有去那里的借口。要是知道那个女孩在哪里住以及何时下班，可以设法在她回家路上的某个地方跟她见面，但尾随她回家的做法不安全，因为那就意味着在真理部外面游荡，必定会引人注意。至于通过邮局寄一封信则根本不可能，那照例根本无密可保，因为所有信件在邮寄途中都会被拆看。实际上只有很少人写信，偶尔需要传递信息的话，有种印有一长串短语的明信片卖，可以用笔划去不适用的短语。再说他也不知道那个女孩的名字，更不用说她的地址。最后，他算定最安全的地方是食堂。如果他能够在她独自一人时坐到她那张桌子前——那张桌子要在食堂的中间，不要太靠近电屏，周围还要有声音够大的嗡嗡谈话声——这些条件如果都能满足比如说半分钟，他们就能交谈上几句话。

此后一星期，生活如同烦躁的梦境。第二天，直到他要走时，她才到食堂，哨声已经响了起来，大概她被调到了晚一点的另外一班。擦肩而过时，他们并未互相看一眼。第二天，她在通常时间到的食堂，不过是跟另外三个女孩坐在一起，而且正好在电屏下方。接下来是极其难熬的三天，她根本没出现过。他的全部身心，都好像被一种无法忍受的敏感所折磨，几乎什么也不能掩饰，那让他所做的每个举动、发出的每个声音、进行的每种接触，以及说出或听到的每句话都成为痛苦不堪的事。就连在睡梦中，温斯顿也无法完全忘记她的模样。那几天里，他没碰他的日记。如果有什么能让他得到解脱，那就是工作，他有时可以一口气忘我工作达十分钟之久。温斯顿完全不知道她是怎么回事，也无处可问。她也许已被蒸发了，也许已经自杀，也许已被发配到大洋国的另一端，而在所有的可能中，最糟糕也是最可能的，是她也许只是改变了主意而已，决定躲开温斯顿。

第二天，那个女孩又出现了。她的胳膊上不再挂吊带，而是在手腕处贴了块橡皮膏。看到她让温斯顿如释重负，以至于忍不住直直盯着她看了几秒钟。第二天，温斯顿几乎跟她说上了话。他走进食堂时，那个女孩坐在离墙很远的一张桌子前，那张桌前只坐着她一个人。当时还早，食堂里的人不太多。领午餐的队伍向前缓慢移动着，温斯顿几乎排到柜台前时，又被耽搁了两分钟，因为他前边的某个人抱怨没收到糖精片。然而在温斯顿拿到他的一盘饭菜后，那个女孩仍独自在那里。温斯顿装作漫不经心地向她走去，眼睛也装着在她那张桌子以外找地方。和她的距离可能有三米，只用两秒钟就能走到她那里。正在此时，温斯顿身后有人在喊：“史密斯！”他装作没听见。“史密斯！”那人又喊了一声，声音更大了。没用。他转过身，一个发色金黄、一脸蠢相的小伙子在叫他，他叫威舍尔，跟温斯顿只是点头之交，这个小伙子正笑容满面邀请他过去坐到自己那张桌子的空位上。拒绝他并非安全之举，被认出后，温斯顿不能再去跟独自坐着的那个女孩坐到一起，那太引人注目了。他脸上带着友善的笑容坐下来。那个金发小伙子的一张蠢脸在对着他笑，温斯顿想象自己拿了把丁字镐挖那张脸。几分钟后，那个女孩所坐的桌子前就坐满了人。

但她肯定看到温斯顿曾经向她走去，也许会理解那种暗示。第二天，温斯顿专门去得早了些。一点没错，她差不多在同样位置的一张桌子前坐着，还是一个人。刚好排在他面前的那个人是个身材矮小、走路很快、长得像甲虫的男人，脸扁，眼睛极小而且多疑。温斯顿拿着托盘从柜台那里转过身时，看到矮个子男人正在向那个女孩坐的桌子笔直走去。他的希望再次沉了下来。远一点有张桌子上有个空位，但从矮个子男人的走路姿势看，他肯定会为了自己舒服而选择人最少的桌子。温斯顿跟在他后面，心里有种冰冷的感觉。没用，除非他能单独跟那个女孩在一起。此时一声巨响，矮个子男人四肢着地趴到地上，他的托盘飞得老远，汤水和咖啡在地上流淌了两道。他开始站起身，一面狠狠瞪了温斯顿一眼，显然怀疑是温斯顿绊倒了他。不过没关系，五秒钟后，温斯顿坐到了那个女孩所坐的桌子前，他的心脏在猛烈跳动着。

他没看她，而是马上摊开托盘里的午餐吃了起来。很重要的是赶在别人到来前马上开口说话，但在这时，他陷入极度恐惧。从她首次接近他以来已经有一星期，她会改变主意的，她一定是改变了主意！这种事不可能有什么结果，现实生活中不会发生。要是没看到安普福斯——就是那位耳朵上长很多汗毛的诗人——在端着托盘没精打采地踱来踱去想找地方坐，他可能临阵退缩，一句话也不说。安普福斯模模糊糊对温斯顿有好感，要是让他看到，他肯定会过来坐到这张桌子前。也许有一分钟时间可以行动。温斯顿和那个女孩都在慢吞吞吃饭，他们吃的是稀稀的炖菜，其实是菜豆汤。温斯顿低声说起话来。他们两人都没有抬头，而是不紧不慢用勺子把那种全是水的玩意儿舀到嘴里面。一勺勺吃着的间隙，他们不动声色低声交谈，说了几句必要的话。

“你什么时候下班？”

“十八点半。”

“我们去哪儿见面？”

“胜利广场，纪念碑旁边。”

“那儿到处是电屏。”

“人多就没关系。”

“用不用信号？”

“不用。除非你看到我在很多人中间，否则别走到我跟前，也别看我，在我附近就行了。”

“什么时候？”

“十九点。”

“好吧。”

安普福斯没看到温斯顿，他在另外一张桌子前坐了下来。两人没有再说话。只要有两个人在同一张桌子前面对面坐着，就会避免互相注视。那个女孩很快吃完午餐走了，温斯顿没走，他抽了一根烟。

温斯顿在约定时间赶到了胜利广场，他在那根有凹槽的巨型圆柱基座附近来回走着。那根圆柱的顶端，老大哥的雕像凝视着南方的天空，第一空域之战中，他在那里击落过欧亚国的飞机（几年前是东亚国的）。圆柱前面那条街上，有座骑在马背上的雕像，应该是奥利弗·克伦威尔(1)。十九点已经过去了五分钟，那个女孩还是没出现。温斯顿又陷入极度恐惧。她不会来了，她改变了主意！他缓缓向着广场北边走去，因为认出了圣马丁教堂而感到一丝愉悦。那座教堂仍有大钟时，曾经鸣响：“你欠我三个法寻。”就在这时，他看到那个女孩站在纪念碑基座上，在读着或者假装读着盘旋而上贴在圆柱上的宣传画。人还没多起来就接近她是不安全的，教堂柱廊顶上的三角楣那里到处安有电屏。但就在那时，左边某个地方传来人们的喊叫和重型汽车隆隆驶过的声音，突然，人们好像都在跑过广场，那个女孩也急忙敏捷地绕过狮子雕塑加入奔跑的人群，温斯顿跟在她后面。奔跑时，从人们的大喊大叫中，得知有一列装着欧亚国俘虏的车队正在经过。

广场南侧已是人头涌动。一般情况下，温斯顿是每次在混乱的人群中，都会自然而然被挤到外围的那种人，可他推搡着往人群中间一点点挤过去。不久，他跟那个女孩的距离就只有一臂之遥，却被一个膀阔腰圆的群众和一个跟他身材相当的女人挡住去路，那两人想来是夫妻，他们好像形成了一堵不可穿越的血肉之墙。温斯顿向旁边一点一点挪着，猛力想把肩膀挤到那两人中间。有那么一阵子，挤在那两个强健的臀部中间，他觉得自己的内脏好像被磨成了肉浆。接着他把身子挤过来，出了点汗。他到了那个女孩的旁边，他们肩并肩站着，眼睛都直盯前方。

一长列卡车在街上缓缓驶过，车厢四个角都有个面无表情、手握冲锋枪的看守立正站着。车厢内蹲着一些矮个子黄种人，身穿破旧的绿色军装。他们紧紧挤在一起，他们带着苦相的蒙古人面孔往卡车两边方向盯着，一点好奇的样子也没有。时不时，卡车摇晃时，能听到金属的丁当撞击声：所有俘虏都戴着脚镣。一卡车一卡车愁苦的面孔过去了，温斯顿知道他们在车上，但他只是有一眼没一眼地看。那个女孩的肩膀，还有一直到肘部的右臂，都在紧贴着他的肩膀和手臂。她的脸颊和他贴近得几乎能让他感受到热气。像在食堂那次一样，她马上又掌握主动，开始用上次那种不动声色的声音说话，嘴唇几乎没动，而只是种咕咕哝哝的声音，容易被淹没在鼎沸的人声和卡车的隆隆声中。

“你能听见我说话吗？”

“能。”

“你星期天下午可以休息吗？”

“可以。”

“那你好好听着，一定要记住。去帕丁顿车站——”

她以一种让他吃惊的军事式精确，勾勒出他要怎么去：坐半个小时火车，在车站外面向左拐，走两公里的路，穿过一座没了横梁的大门，走过一条野地里的小路、一条长满荒草的小径还有条灌木丛间的小道，然后到了一棵长着苔藓的死树——就好像她脑袋里有张地图。“你全记住了吗？”她最后低声问道。

“记住了。”

“你先向左转，然后向右转，然后再向左转。那道大门没了横梁。”

“记住了，什么时候？”

“十五点左右。你可能得等一会儿，我要走的是另外一条路。你肯定都记住了吗？”

“对。”

“那你赶快离开我吧。”

她没必要对他说这个，然而当时他们无法从人群中脱身。卡车还在隆隆驶过，人们仍在不知满足地张着嘴观看。一开始有零星的几声嘘弄，但那只是人群中的党员发出的，很快就没有了。人们的主要感情是好奇。外国人，不管来自欧亚国或是东亚国，都是种陌生的动物，除了以俘虏的样子出现，几乎一个也没见过，就算是俘虏，也只能短暂地扫上一眼而已。除了不多的几个被作为战争犯绞死，从来不知道别的俘虏下场如何，他们只是消失了而已，大概进了劳改营。蒙古人种的圆面孔之后，是更为欧洲化的面孔，肮脏，满面胡须，神情疲惫。那一双双眼睛从满是胡茬的颧骨上方盯着温斯顿的眼睛，有时奇怪地很专心地看着他，然后就望向别处。车队快过完了，最后一辆卡车上，他看到一个上了年纪的人，他浓密的灰色头发披散在脸前，直挺挺地站着，手腕在身子前方交叉，好像习惯了双手被绑在一起。几乎已经到了和那个女孩分手的时间，但在最后一刻，当人群将他们重重包围时，她的手摸索到了他的，并紧握了一小会儿。

那不可能有十秒钟，然而他们的手好像在一起紧握了很久，让他得以了解她手上的每一个细节。他摸索着她长长的手指、形状美观的指甲、因为干活而长满老茧的手掌、腕部下面光滑的肌肉，等等。尽管只是用手摸，但差不多等于眼睛也看到了。与此同时，他想到他不知道那个女孩的眼睛是什么颜色，很可能是褐色的，不过黑头发的人有时会长着蓝眼睛。转过头看她会是蠢不可及的举动。他们的手仍扣在一起，在拥挤的人群中并不引人注目。他们平静地望向前方。不是那个女孩的，而是那个上了年纪的俘虏的眼睛，在透过一头乱发悲伤地注视着温斯顿。

第二章


温斯顿沿着小径一路走来，穿过了斑驳的光影组合。每当头顶上的树枝分开时，他踏进的是黄金洼。他左边的树林下方，盛开着欲迷人眼的蓝铃花。微风像在亲吻他的皮肤。这天是五月二日，从树林里更深的地方，传来了斑鸠的咕咕叫声。

他来得有点早，一路走来没费什么事。那个女孩显然经验丰富，他因此没那么提心吊胆——而一般情况下他可能会——大概可以相信她能找到一个安全地方。一般说来，你不可以认为在乡下就一定比在伦敦安全得多。当然乡下没有电屏，可是总有危险不知道哪里隐藏着话筒，你的声音会被拾音并辨认出来。再者，一个人出趟远门难以不被注意到。外出范围不超过一百公里，不需要在通行证上签注，但有时候火车站会有巡逻队，他们会检查在那里看到的任何一个党员的证件，还会问些难以回答的问题。但这次巡逻队没有出现。走路离开火车站时，他小心翼翼往后瞟着，以确定无人跟踪。火车上坐满了群众，因为夏天天气的缘故，车上一片欢乐的气氛。他所乘的那节木板座位的车厢里，满当当地坐了一个大家庭的成员，从牙齿掉光的曾奶奶到一个月大的婴儿，他们要花一下午时间去乡下看望他们的“姻亲”，还无所顾忌地跟温斯顿解释他们要去黑市买点黄油。

那条小径变阔了，温斯顿很快就走上一条那个女孩跟他说过的人行小道，只是条夹在灌木丛间的赶牛时走的小道。他没有手表，但是还不可能到十五点。脚下的蓝铃花繁茂得不免要踩上去，他跪下来开始采摘一些，一半是为了消磨时间，另外他还有个模模糊糊的想法，就是可以见面时献给那个女孩。他已经采了一大束。他正闻着那隐约的难闻气味时，背后的一声响动让他突然停了下来，一点没错，那是脚踩在树枝上的咔嚓声。他继续采摘着蓝铃花，这是最好的做法。可能是那个女孩，也可能他到底还是被跟踪了，往周围看是做贼心虚的表现。他采了一朵又一朵。有只手轻轻搭在他的肩膀上。

他抬起头，是那个女孩。她摇摇头，显然是警告他必须保持沉默，然后她拨开灌木丛领他沿一条窄窄的小道往树林深处走去。显然她以前来过这里，因为她走路时，似乎是习惯性地避开湿软的地方。温斯顿跟着她，手里还紧握着那束花。他的第一感觉是松了口气，他看走在前面的她那强壮苗条的身体，那条鲜红色饰带紧得刚好能让她臀部的曲线显现出来，自惭形秽的感觉沉重地压在他心头。甚至是现在，她如果转过身子看他，似乎很有可能她仍会完全退却。宜人的微风和树叶的绿意令他气馁。从火车站那里走过来，五月的阳光已经让他感觉自己身上肮脏，而且上气不接下气。他是个室内动物，伦敦那混合着煤烟的空气已经渗进他的皮肤毛孔。他想可能直到现在，她大概仍然没有在光天化日下看过他。他们走到她说过的那棵倒下的树干那里。那个女孩跳过树干，在灌木丛中分开一条路，那里好像没什么入口。温斯顿跟着她走过去，发现他们站在一片天然形成的空地上，小小的土墩上长满了青草，周围是高高的小树，把它完全封闭起来。那个女孩停下脚步转过身。

“到了。”她说。

他离她几步看着她，还是不敢向她再走近些。

“我在那条小路上不想说话，”她又说，“以防万一那儿藏有话筒。我估计不会，不过也有可能，那些猪猡里的谁总有可能听出来是你的声音。我们在这儿没事。”

他仍然没勇气接近她。“我们在这儿没事。”他傻傻地重复了一句。

“对，你看那些树。”那是细细的白蜡树，一度被砍掉了，后来又长成一带小树林，一律比手腕还细。“没有一根粗得可以藏进话筒，再说我以前也来过这儿。”

他们只是在没话找话。这时他向她走近了一些，她在他面前直直站立着，脸上带着微笑，看上去有一丝嘲弄的样子，似乎在纳闷他为何行动得这样慢。蓝铃花散落在地上，像是自己掉下去的。他握住她的手。

“你相信吗？”他说，“直到这会儿，我还不知道你的眼睛是什么颜色的呢。”褐色的，他注意到了，是种很淡的褐色，眼睫毛是黑色的。“你现在看到了我的真实长相，你受得了看我吗？”

“能，这不难。”

“我三十九岁了，有个无法摆脱的老婆，患静脉曲张溃疡，而且有五颗假牙。”

“我根本无所谓。”那个女孩说。

接着，也难说是谁采取的主动，她到了温斯顿的怀里。一开始，除了完全不敢相信，温斯顿没有别的感觉。那具年轻的躯体在紧搂着他，浓密的黑发贴着他的脸庞，好极了！她转过脸庞，他在亲吻那两片张开的红嘴唇了。她紧搂着温斯顿的脖子，她在叫他宝贝、心肝和爱人。温斯顿拉着她让她躺倒在地上，她没有一丝反抗，他想对她怎么样都行。但事实上，温斯顿在肉体上没有感觉，只是单纯的触觉，只感到骄傲和难以置信。温斯顿因为发生了这件事而感到高兴，然而没有肉体欲望。它发生得太快了，她的年轻和美貌吓坏了他，他过分习惯没有女人的生活——他不知道是因为什么。那个女孩自己站了起来，从头发上扯下一朵蓝铃花。她挨着温斯顿坐着，手臂搂着他的腰。

“没关系，亲爱的，不用急，整个一下午全是我们的。这儿是不是个特别棒的藏身地方？我是在有一次集体远足迷路时候找到的。有人来的话，隔着一百米就能听到。”

“你叫什么？”温斯顿问道。

“茱莉娅，我知道你的名字，温斯顿——温斯顿·史密斯。”

“你是怎么知道的？”

“我想在查清什么事方面，我比你强一点，亲爱的。告诉我，我塞给你那张纸条前，你是怎么看待我的？”

他一点没想到要对她说谎。以告知最坏的情况为开始甚至是一种爱心的表现。

“我极不喜欢看到你，”他说，“想对你先奸后杀。就在两星期前，我正儿八经想过用一块鹅卵石砸烂你的头。你要是真的想知道，我想象过你跟思想警察有联系。”

那个女孩开心地笑了起来，显然把这句话当成对她伪装高明的称赞之语。

“别又是思想警察！你不是真的那样想吧？”

“这个嘛，也许不是完全那样想，但从你的总体外表——只是因为你年轻、朝气蓬勃、身体健康，你也明白——我以为你大概——”

“你以为我是个好党员，言行纯粹，旗帜，游行，标语，比赛，集体远足——都是那些事儿。你还以为我要是有那么一丁点儿机会，就会把你当做思想犯揭发出来，从而让你被消灭掉，对不对？”

“对，也就是那些。许多年轻女孩都那样，你也知道。”

“都是这个操蛋玩意儿闹的。”她说着把那条青少年反性同盟的鲜红色饰带扯下来扔到一根树枝上。这时，好像碰到自己的腰部让她想起什么事情，她从工作服口袋里掏出一小片巧克力，把它掰成两块，一块递给了温斯顿。甚至他接过之前，他就从气味上判断出那是种很少见的巧克力。它是黑色的，而且有光泽，用银纸包着。一般所见的巧克力是种淡褐色的脆玩意儿，味道正如人们描述的，像烧垃圾的气味。但在某个时候，他尝过她给他的那种巧克力是什么味道。他第一次闻到它的香味，就在他心里唤起了某种无法确定的记忆，那种记忆是深刻的，也令人不安。

“你从哪儿搞到的这玩意儿？”他问道。

“黑市。”她漫不经心地说，“我其实就是那种女孩，你看好了。我比赛表现出色，在侦察队当过中队长。我一星期三个晚上为青少年反性同盟做义务工作，在伦敦到处贴他们那种胡扯淡的玩意儿，一贴就是几小时。游行时，我总是举着横幅的一端，总是看上去精神愉快，从来不推辞什么事。永远要跟大家一起大喊大叫，我说的就是这个意思，这是保护自己的唯一方法。”

第一小片巧克力已在温斯顿的舌头上融化了。它的味道很可口，那种记忆却仍然在他的意识边缘游移着，感觉强烈，但无法还原成一种明确的形象，如同眼角看到的东西一样。他把这种感觉从心里推开，只知道那是关于某个行为的记忆，他想弥补那个行为的后果，却做不到。

“你很年轻，”他说，“比我年轻十到十五岁，怎么会觉得我这样的男人有吸引力呢？”

“跟你的面容有关，我觉得我要冒冒险。我在发现谁是与众不同的人这方面很在行，一看到你，我就知道你是跟他们作对的。”

他们，她的意思似乎是指党，首先指内党。她谈论起他们时，带着不加掩饰的嘲笑和仇恨，让温斯顿感觉不安，即使他知道不会有别的地方比这里更安全。令他震惊的是她的语言之粗鄙。按说党员不应该说脏话，温斯顿自己也很少说，不管怎么样，而茱莉娅好像每次一提到党——特别是内党——的时候，就不能不用上在污水遍地的小巷墙壁上用粉笔写的那种话。对这点，他并非不喜欢，那只不过是她反感党及其种种行径的一种表示，而且不知为何，显得自然而又健康，如同一匹马在闻到不好的草料时，打了个响鼻一样。他们已经离开那片空地，在光影斑驳的树荫下散步。只要能并肩走路，他们的手臂都搭在一起。他留意到她的腰部在没了那条饰带后有多柔软。他们一直在压着嗓门悄声说话，茱莉娅说在空地外面最好悄悄走路。不久，他们到了小树林的边缘，她让他别再往前走。

“别走到空地上，可能有谁在监视，待在树后面就没事。”

他们站在榛树丛的树荫下，阳光经过无数树叶的过滤照在他们脸上，仍然感觉火辣辣的。温斯顿看着那边的原野，奇怪地心里渐渐有了种震惊的感觉，他认识这个地方。他知道这个地方的样子。这是块被啃噬得很厉害的古老草场，有条人行小径蜿蜒穿过，到处都有鼹鼠丘。对面参差不齐的树篱那里，榆树枝在微风吹拂下，勉强能看到在摇动，上面的树叶在微微颤动，大团大团的，像是女人的头发。肯定附近某个地方有条小溪，还有鲮鱼在其中游着的绿色池塘，只是看不见而已，难道没有吗？

“附近难道没有一条小溪？”他低声说。

“没错，那边有一条，实际上就在那块地的边上。里面有鱼，很大的鱼。能看到鱼就浮在柳树下面的池塘里，摆着尾巴。”

“那就是黄金乡了——几乎是。”他喃喃地说。

“黄金乡？”

“没什么，真的。就是我有时候梦到的地方。”

“你看！”茱莉娅说。

一只画眉鸟飞到离他们不到五米远的一根树枝上，几乎跟他们的脸部在同一高度。也许它没看到他们，它在太阳地里，而他们在树荫下。它张开翅膀又小心收好，接着猛然把头低下一会儿，似乎在向太阳行某种礼。接着，它开始啼唱出一连串歌声。午后的静寂中，鸟啼声大得令人惊异。温斯顿和茱莉娅紧紧搂抱在一起，在着迷地听着。那啼唱声没完没了，唱了一分钟又一分钟，变化无穷，令人惊讶，而且一次也没重复，几乎好像那只小鸟在从容展示它的完美技巧。有时它停了几秒，展开翅膀然后又收起，接着又鼓起它有斑点的胸部唱起来。温斯顿看着它，隐隐有了种敬畏之心。那只鸟是为谁、为何而啼唱？没有求偶对象，也没对手在看着它。是什么让它落脚到了这片偏僻的树林，然后向着空旷啼唱起来？他怀疑说不定附近哪里到底还是藏了个话筒。他和茱莉娅只是在悄声说话，话筒拾不到音，然而会拾到画眉的啼叫。也许在那种设备的另一端，某个长得像甲虫的矮个男人正专心听着——听那个。然而渐渐地，那不绝的啼唱声让他脑子里什么都不再思考，似乎它是种液体，和树叶过滤下来的阳光混合在一起，全倾泄在他身上。他停止思考，只是去感觉。那个女孩的腰部在他臂弯里感觉柔软温暖。他把她的身子转过来，好让他们面对面。她的身体好像融进了他的，不管温斯顿把手放到哪儿，她的身体都像随物赋形的水一样。他们久久吻在一起，跟他们早些时候笨拙的亲吻很不一样。停止接吻后，他们都深深叹了口气。那只鸟儿受到惊吓，翅膀一振便飞走了。

温斯顿把嘴唇贴近她的耳朵。“现在。”他悄声说。

“别在这儿。”她也悄声说，“回到那个别人看不到的地方，安全些。”

他们很快又穿过树林回到那片空地，偶尔踩断一两根小树枝。走到小树环绕的那片空地后，她转身面对他。他们都呼吸急促，然而她的嘴角又现出微笑。她站在那里看了温斯顿一会儿，然后摸到自己工作服上的拉链。真是好极了！几乎跟温斯顿的梦境一模一样，几乎跟他想象的一样迅速，她一把扯下衣服。把衣服扔到一边时，动作也一样优雅无比，似乎整个一种文化被摧毁了。她的躯体在太阳下闪着白色光芒。他的眼睛紧盯那张有雀斑的脸庞，上面带着淡淡的、无所顾忌的笑容。他跪下去，握住了她的手。

“你以前也这么过吗？”

“当然，几百次——噢，几十次总有了吧。”

“跟党员？”

“当然，总是跟党员。”

“跟内党党员？”

“不跟那些猪猡，从来没有过。不过他们中间有很多人有半点儿机会就会，他们可不像装扮的那样神圣。”

温斯顿的心脏猛烈跳动起来。她已经做过几十次了，他希望会是几百次、几千次。凡是暗示堕落的事，总让他的心里充满狂想。天晓得，也许党已经是金玉其外，败絮其中，对艰苦生活和克己奉公的极力鼓吹只是为了掩盖罪恶的假象而已。如果温斯顿能向他们的许许多多人传染上麻风或梅毒，那他会极其愿意去做！凡是能起到腐化、削弱和破坏作用的事情都行！他把茱莉娅拉了下来，他们面对面跪在那里。

“听着，你有过的男人越多，我就越爱你。你明白我的话吗？”

“明白，完全明白。”

“我恨纯洁无暇，我恨品质优良！我不想看到任何地方存在任何德行，我想看到人们都堕落到了骨头里。”

“这样的话，我应该是适合你的了，亲爱的，我堕落到了骨头里。”

“你喜欢这个吗？我不是说仅仅跟我，而是说这件事情本身。”

“极其喜欢。”

那是他最想听到的，不仅爱某个人，而且是那种动物本能，那种简单的、人人皆存的欲望，那是种能将党摧毁于无形的力量。他把她压倒在草地上，就在掉落的蓝铃花中间。这次没遇到困难。不久，他们的呼吸恢复到了正常频率，带着愉快的无助感，他们的身体分开了。他伸手把扔在一旁的那件工作服拉过去给她盖上了一点。他们几乎马上就睡着了，睡了差不多半个小时。

温斯顿首先醒来，他坐起来看那张长有雀斑的脸庞。她仍在安详地睡觉，头枕在手掌上。除了嘴唇，她不能说漂亮。仔细看的话，能看到她眼角有一两道皱纹。她一头短短的黑发特别浓密，特别柔软。他想起自己仍不知道她姓什么，以及住在哪里。

那具年轻强壮的躯体此刻正无助地睡眠，他心里被唤起一种怜悯的、要将其保护的感情。但那种不思不想的亲切感仍未完全重现，那是他在榛树下听画眉鸟唱歌时所感到的。他把她的工作服拉开，仔细看着她那光滑的白色肋腹。他想，在过去，男人看着女人的躯体，看得产生了欲望，就这么简单。如今却既没有纯粹的爱，也没有纯粹的肉欲，没有一种情感是纯粹的，因为一切都混和了恐惧及仇恨。他们的拥抱就是场战斗，高潮就是胜利。是向党的一击，是政治行为。





第三章


“这地方我们还可以再来一次，”茱莉娅说，“藏身处通常用两次还安全，不过当然要隔上一两个月。”

她一醒来，举止立刻变了个样，变得机警而且有条理。她穿上衣服，把那条鲜红色饰带在腰间打了个结后，就开始安排回去怎么走，把这些留给她安排好像很自然。她显然有种机变处事的能力，是温斯顿所缺乏的。茱莉娅似乎对伦敦周围的乡下了如指掌，那积累自无数次集体远足。茱莉娅跟他说的回家路线跟他来时走的很不一样，他要在另外一个火车站下车。“回家时走的路，永远不要跟出来时是同一条。”她好像在宣布一条重要的基本原则。她会先走，温斯顿等半个小时后再走。

茱莉娅说了个他们下班后可以见面的地方，是在四天后。那里位于贫民窟，有个露天市场，一般情况下总是熙熙攘攘、人声鼎沸。她会在摊档间转悠，装着在找鞋带或者缝衣线。如果茱莉娅认为平安无事，他走近时会擤一下鼻子，否则他就和她擦肩走过，装作互不相识。但如果运气好，他们可以在人群中谈上一刻钟话，安排下次会面。

“现在我得走了。”温斯顿一明白给他的指示后茱莉娅就说，“我应该在十九点半回去，我一定要在青少年反性同盟那里花两个小时，要么散发传单，要么干别的事。是不是很操蛋？请你帮我把身上拍一拍。我头发里有没有小树枝？你肯定吗？那么再见了，亲爱的，再见！”

她一下子扑进他的怀里，几乎是猛烈地吻他。过了一会儿，她在小树苗中拔开一条路，便消失在树林中，弄出的声响很小。即使到这时，他还是不知道她姓什么，在哪里住，但这无所谓，因为不可能想象他们能在室内见面，也不可能有什么文字交流。

事实上，他们从未再去过那片林中空地。五月份，他们只有另外一次机会真正做了爱，是在茱莉娅知道的别的一个很好的藏身之所，在一间废弃教堂的钟楼上。那里三十年前挨过原子弹，周围几乎完全荒废，只要能去，倒是个很好的藏身之所，但路上很危险。其他时间里，他们只能在街上见面，每天傍晚换个地方，而且每次见面从来不超过半小时。一般情况下，在街上可以勉强谈话。他们在熙熙攘攘的人行道上漫无目的地走着，不算是并排走，从不互相看。他们进行有一句没一句的奇特交谈，如同灯塔光柱的一闪一灭。接近身穿党员制服的人，或者到了电屏附近时突然打住话头，保持沉默，然后几分钟后接上没说完的那句继续说。到了商量好的地点突然中断谈话，第二天几乎不需要开场白就接着往下说。茱莉娅好像很习惯进行这种谈话，称之为“分期谈话”，她擅长说话时不动嘴唇，令人吃惊。在几乎有一个月之久的傍晚会面中，他们只接过一次吻。那次，他们正在一条小街上走着（在大街以外的街上，茱莉娅从来不说话），突然传来震耳欲隆的一声巨响，大地在震动，空中一片黑烟。温斯顿发现自己侧躺在地上，皮肤擦伤了，吓得要命。一发火箭弹肯定落在离他们很近的地方。突然，他看到离他几厘米外的茱莉娅的脸庞，死一般的苍白，连她的嘴唇也苍白。她死了！他紧紧抱着她，却感到亲吻的是一张活人的温暖面庞，然而有些粉末之类的东西进到他嘴里，他们两人的脸上，都落了一层厚厚的灰泥。

有几个晚上，他们到达约会地点后，却不得不连个信号也没打就擦肩而过，那是因为有支巡逻队正好从街角转过来，或者有一架直升飞机正在头顶盘旋。就算没那么危险时，仍然难以挤出时间见面。温斯顿一星期工作六十个小时，茱莉娅的工作时间还要长一些，他们的休息日则根据工作紧迫度调整，不一定是哪天，不能经常凑到一起。不管怎样，茱莉娅很少有哪个晚上完全空闲。她把令人吃惊的大量时间花在像听讲座、游行、散发青少年反性同盟的宣传品、为仇恨周准备旗帜、为节约运动收捐款之类的事情上。她说那都值得，是伪装，遵守一些小条条，就能违犯一些大框框。她甚至说服温斯顿牺牲一晚上时间去报名参加兼职军火生产工作，那都是党员积极分子自愿参加的。所以温斯顿每星期有一个晚上要烦得要命地度过四小时，把小金属块用螺丝拧在一起，大概是用来做炸弹的引信。干活的车间里过堂风很大，光线不足，锤子声跟电屏里的音乐混在一起，令人生厌。

在教堂的塔楼里相见时，他们又补上了零零碎碎谈话的断茬。那是个炎热的下午，在大钟上面的小方屋子里，空气闷热且不流通，鸽子粪臭气熏天。他们坐在满是灰尘、遍布小树枝的地板上一谈就是几小时，还要不时透过了望孔往外看，以确保没人来。

茱莉娅二十六岁，跟三十个女孩住集体宿舍（“总是生活在女人的臭味当中！”她补充道）。她的工作，正如温斯顿已经猜到的，是负责小说司的一部小说写作机。她喜欢自己的工作，那主要是开动并维护一台功率很大、难以侍弄的电动马达。她“不算聪明”，却喜欢动手，机械方面是行家里手。她说得清楚生产一部小说的全部流程，从计划委员会发布总指令到由修改组进行最后的润色。但她对最终的成品不感兴趣，按她的话说，是“不怎么喜欢读书”。书籍只是种必须生产出来的日用品，如同果酱或者鞋带。

她不记得六十年代初之前的事，认识的唯一一个经常说起革命前生活如何如何的人是她爷爷，在她八岁时就失踪了。上学时，她当过曲棍球队队长，连续两年获得过体操比赛的奖杯。她当过侦察队的中队长，加入青少年反性同盟前，当过青年团的支部书记。她一贯表现出过硬的素质，甚至被选中（那是名誉很好的标志，绝对可靠）在色情科——小说司下面的一个科——工作，这个科负责生产出低级下流的黄色书籍在群众中发行。据她说，这个科被其工作人员起了个绰号叫“粪坑”。她在那里工作了一年，帮助生产用密封套封起来的小册子，有着像《打屁股故事》或《女校一夜》这种书名。群众里的青年偷偷摸摸地购买，觉得自己在购买某种违禁品。

“那些书是写什么的？”温斯顿好奇地问。

“噢，垃圾到了极点，都很没劲，真的。情节总共只有六种，不过他们把这几种情节翻来覆去用。当然，我只是在小说写作机上工作，从来没在重写组干过。我文笔不行，亲爱的——根本不够格。”

他惊讶地得知，色情科里所有工作人员除了科长都是女孩子。有种说法是男人的性本能比女人的更难控制，因此男人受到所经手的淫秽作品腐蚀的危险更大。

“他们甚至不喜欢结了婚的女人在那儿工作，”她又说，“女孩子总被认为很纯洁，可是不管怎样，我不算。”

她第一次跟男人发生关系是在十六岁，跟一个六十岁的党员，他后来为避免被捕而自杀。“干得很漂亮，”茱莉娅说，“要不然在他坦白时，他们会从他嘴里知道我的名字。”在那以后，她还跟别的许多男人发生过关系。生活在她看来很简单：你想开开心，“他们”——指的是党——不想让你开心，你就尽量去违犯规定。她似乎觉得“他们”会力图剥夺你的快乐，就跟你力图不被抓到一样，是件自然而然的事。她仇恨党，而且是以最粗俗的语言说出来，但她也并非一切看不顺眼，除了影响到她个人生活的，她对党的教义没兴趣。他注意到除了已经进入日常生活的，她从不使用新话的词语。她从未听说过兄弟会，也不相信其存在。在她看来，凡是针对党的有组织反抗都注定会以失败告终，而且是愚蠢之举，聪明的做法是违反规定，同时也保往脑袋。他不知道年轻一代中还有多少人像她那样——在革命的天下长大，对别的一无所知，接受党就像接受天空一样，是不可改变的，不去对抗它的权威，只是躲避它，就像兔子会躲避狗一样。

他们没讨论过有没有可能结婚这个问题，那太遥不可及了，不值得去想。即便温斯顿的妻子凯瑟琳有办法摆脱，也想象不到哪个委员会批准这样一桩婚姻，连做白日梦也无济于事。

“你老婆是个什么样的？”茱莉娅问道。

“她是——你知不知道新话有个词叫‘思想好’，意思是生来正统，不会产生坏想法？”

“不，我不知道那个词，不过我认识那种人，认识得够多的了。”

他开始讲起有关他婚后生活的事，然而很奇怪的是，茱莉娅好像已经了解这种生活的基本内容，好像她已经看到过或者感到过一样，她开始向温斯顿描述他一碰到凯瑟琳，她的身子就变得僵硬，还有即使她的手臂紧搂着他，她仍好像在全力推开他的样子。跟茱莉娅在一起，他感到说起这种事情没有一点困难：不管怎样，关于凯瑟琳的记忆早已不再是痛苦的了，只不过令人有些不快而已。

“要不是因为那件事，我本来还能忍下去。”温斯顿说。他告诉她凯瑟琳每周同一天晚上强迫他来一遍的令人沮丧的仪式：“她很不喜欢那样，可是怎么也不能让她停下来不做。你永远猜不到她怎样称呼它。”

“我们对党的义务。”茱莉娅马上说。

“你怎么知道？”

“我上过学，亲爱的。对十六岁以上的学生每周一次性教育，青年团里也有。他们花很多年时间把它强灌进人们的脑子。我敢说在很多人身上是奏效了，当然这永远也说不准，人们总是很虚伪。”

她开始就这一话题发了番议论。在茱莉娅眼里，一切以她自己的性欲为出发点。一谈到这个问题，她就有极为敏锐的看法。跟温斯顿不一样，她了解党的禁欲主义的内在含义：不仅因为性本能会造成一个自成一体的世界，那是党无法控制的，因而可能的话，一定得把它消灭掉，更重要的，是性压抑能导致歇斯底里，这求之不得，因为它能被转化成战争狂热和对领袖的崇拜。她是这样说的：

“你做爱时，耗尽了全部力气，然后你感到愉快，对一切都无所谓。他们不能忍受你有这种感觉，他们想要你时时保持精力充沛。所有那些来来去去的操练、欢呼、挥舞旗帜，等等，都无非是另外的性发泄方式。如果你内心感觉愉快，干吗还要为老大哥、三年计划、两分钟仇恨会以及所有别的操蛋玩意儿激动？”

一点没错，他想。禁欲和政治正统性之间有着直接和密不可分的关系，因为党想把党员们的恐惧、仇恨和理智尽失的轻信保持在合适水平，除了抑制某种强烈的本能并把它转化成驱动力，还有什么别的办法？性冲动对党危险，党对之加以利用。他们对父母本能也照此处理。家庭无法在事实上被消灭，人们甚至被鼓励以差不多古已有之的方式钟爱他们的孩子，另一方面，孩子被有系统地改造得与其父母为敌，被教导监视其父母，并揭发他们的越轨行为。家庭实际上成了思想警察的延伸物。这样，每个人就会被十分了解他们的告密者日以继夜地包围。

他的思绪突然又转回凯瑟琳。如果她不至于愚蠢得察觉不到他的观念不合正统，无疑会向思想警察检举他。然而此刻让他想起凯瑟琳的，是那天下午令人窒息的燠热，他额头上因此冒出了汗珠，他开始向茱莉娅讲述以前发生过的一件事，或者说，是没有发生过的一件事，那也是在一个闷热的夏天下午，十一年前的事了。

那是结婚后三四个月时，他们在去肯特郡的一次远足中迷了路。他们只落后其他人一两分钟，却转错了向，不久发现走到一个老白垩采石场的边缘，前无去路。边缘离底部的垂直高度有二三十米，底下全是大石头。他们看不到一个可以问路的人。凯瑟琳一意识到他们迷了路，就显得特别不安，离开闹哄哄的那群人哪怕只是一会儿，也让她有种做错事的感觉，想尽快沿原路返回，然后向别的方向寻找。但就在那时，温斯顿注意到他们脚下悬崖的裂缝里有几丛黄连花，其中一丛有两种颜色，品红和砖红，显然长在同一条根上。他从未见过那种黄连花，就叫凯瑟琳也过去看。

“你看，凯瑟琳！你看那些花，靠近底下的那一丛，你看到是两种不同颜色的吗？”

她已经转过身走了，但还是很不情愿地走回头待了一会儿。她甚至在悬崖上往前倾着身子看他手指的方向。他在她身后不远处站着，用手扶着她的腰。此时，他突然想到他们有多孤单，一个人也看不到，没有一片树叶在颤动，没有一只小鸟在啼叫。在这种地方，不大可能哪里藏有话筒，而且就算有，也只能拾音而已。那是下午最热、最让人想睡觉的时候，太阳热辣辣地照着他们，汗水在他脸上痒痒地流着。他想到……

“你干吗不猛推她一下？”茱莉娅说，“换了我就会。”

“没错，亲爱的，你会。如果当时的我是像现在这样，我也会。要么说，我也许会——我不敢肯定。”

“你是不是后悔没干？”

“对，总的说来，我后悔没干。”

他们挨着坐在落满灰尘的地板上。他把她拉向自己，她的头靠在他肩膀上，她头发里好闻的气味盖过了鸽子粪味。他想，她很年轻，对生活还有点期盼，她不理解把一个碍事的人推下悬崖并不能解决任何问题。

“其实那也无济于事。”他说。

“那你干吗后悔没干？”

“我只是喜欢积极的，而不是消极的处事方式。在我们参加的这场比赛中，我们无法取胜。以某些方式失败比以别的方式失败要好一些，如此而已。”

他感到她的肩膀不同意地扭动一下。每次他说出这种话时，她总是跟他意见相左，她接受不了个人总会被打败是条自然法则。从某种意义上说，她也意识到自己劫数已定，或早或晚，思想警察会抓到并处死她，然而在她另一半心思中，她相信不管怎样，有可能构建一个秘密世界，可以按照自己的想法在其中生活，需要的只是运气、计谋和胆量。她不理解不存在幸福这回事，不理解唯一的胜利是在遥远的将来，在你死后很久，不理解在你向党宣战的那一刻起，你最好想象自己已经是一具尸体。

“我们是死人。”他说。

“我们还没死哪。”茱莉娅倒是实话实说。

“不是说在肉体上，那要再过半年，一年——五年，可以想象能再活那么久吧。我不怕死。你年轻，所以你大概比我更害怕死。显然我们会把死亡尽量往后推，但效果极其有限。只要人类仍然保持人性，生和死便是同等事情。”

“噢，废话！我跟骷髅，你更想跟哪个睡觉？你觉得活着不好吗？你来感觉一下：这是我的手，这是我的腿，我是真实的，有形的，活着的！你难道不喜欢这样？”

茱莉娅的身子转过来，把胸膛紧紧贴着温斯顿。透过工作服，他能感觉到她的乳房，成熟但仍坚挺。她的身体好像在把青春和活力倾注进他的体内。

“是的，我喜欢。”他说。

“那就别说死了。听着，亲爱的，我们要定好下次见面时间。我们还可以回到树林里那个地方，好久没去了。不过你这次去，一定要走另外一条路，我全计划好了，你坐火车——哎，我还是给你画出来吧。”

她以那种实际作风，很老练地用手聚拢了一小方块灰尘，用一根从鸽子窝里拿的树枝，开始在地板上画地图。





第四章


温斯顿环视着查林顿先生楼上那个破破烂烂的小房间。窗边，那张特大的木床已经铺好，上面放着破旧的毯子和没盖枕巾的长枕头。那座有十二小时刻度的时钟在壁炉台上嘀嘀嗒嗒走着。墙角那张折叠桌上，放着上次来时买的那块玻璃镇纸，在半明半暗的光线下幽幽闪着光。

壁炉挡板那里，有个破旧的铁制油炉，一口深底锅，还有两个杯子，查林顿先生提供的。温斯顿点着油炉并把一锅水放上面去煮，他带来了满满一信封胜利咖啡和一些糖精片。时钟指针指向七点二十，其实是十九点二十，她将在十九点半到。

愚蠢啊愚蠢，他心里一直在说：这是明知故犯、无缘无故、自寻绝路的愚蠢，在党员能犯下的所有罪行里，数这种罪行最不可能掩盖。实际上，他第一次有了这个想法，是在看到折叠桌面反射出的那块玻璃镇纸的样子时。不出所料，查林顿先生很爽快就把房间租给了他，他显然为能赚到几元钱而高兴。弄清楚温斯顿租房间是为了跟情人幽会后，他也没有流露出震惊或者令人反感的心照不宣的模样，而是目光前视，泛泛而谈起来，带着一种微妙的神色，给温斯顿造成一种印象：他已经变得处于有形无形之间。他说独处是件很重要的事情，谁都希望有地方让他们可以偶尔独自待一下。他们有了这么一个地方时，对任何一个知情人而言，不再外传是唯一有礼貌的做法。他甚至又加了一句那幢房子有两个入口，其中之一穿过后院通向一条小巷。说话时，他好像几乎就要隐身不见。

窗户下边有人唱歌，温斯顿从挡得严严实实的平纹布窗帘后向外偷看。六月的太阳离落下仍然很高，楼下阳光照彻的院子里，一个身躯庞大的女人脚步通通响地来回于洗衣盆和晾衣服绳之间，正在往绳上夹一溜四方形的小片东西，温斯顿认出那是尿布。那个女人结实得像根巨大的圆柱，长着肌肉结实的红色手臂，腰上系了一条粗麻布围裙。只要嘴里没噙着衣服夹子，她就会用浑厚的女低音唱道：



这不过是种无用的幻想，

就像四月天般易逝。

但是一个眼神、一句话和唤起的梦啊，

已把我的心儿窃取！



过去几周里，伦敦到处能听到这首歌，它是音乐司之下某个科为群众出版的无数类似歌曲中的一首。谱写这些歌曲时，完全不用人动手，而是由一部韵曲机写出来。然而那个女人能把它唱得悦耳动听，以至于把那种臭大粪的东西变得几乎称得上悦耳。他能听到那个女人在唱歌，还有她的鞋子走在石板路上发出的刺耳声音，还有街上小孩子的哭喊声，远处还传来隐隐的隆隆汽车声，但房间里似乎安静得奇怪，那是没有电屏的缘故。

愚蠢，愚蠢，愚蠢啊！他又想。不可想象他们一连几周都来这个地方而不被抓到，然而对他们两人来说，有个完全属于他们的，在室内而且近在咫尺的藏身之处，这种诱惑太大了。去过那个教堂钟楼后，有段时间他们没办法再安排会面。为迎接仇恨周的到来，工作时间大大延长。距仇恨周还有一个月时间，但是随之而来的规模宏大而且复杂的准备活动让每个人都必须加班。终于，他们等来了两人都不用上班的一天下午，他们商量过要再去树林里的那块空地。之前一天傍晚，他们在街上短暂地见了一面。他们在人群中朝着对方渐渐走近时，温斯顿照例几乎不怎么看茱莉娅的脸庞，但在很快瞟了她一眼时，发现她的脸色比平时更为苍白。

“全吹了，”在觉得安全时，她马上低声说，“我是说明天。”

“什么？”

“明天下午我去不了。”

“为什么去不了？”

“哦，还是那个原因，这次提前了。”

有那么一阵子，温斯顿感到火冒三丈。认识茱莉娅之后的那个月里，他对于她的欲望性质改变了。一开始，这种欲望中真正性欲的成份很少。他们第一次做爱只是种兴之所至的行为，然而第二次以后变了。茱莉娅头发的气味、嘴里的味道、皮肤的触觉似乎已经进入他的内心，或者说进入他周围的空气中。她已经成为实际上的必需物，他不仅想拥有她，而且觉得有权拥有她。茱莉娅说她没法去时，他有种感觉她在骗他。但就在此时，人群把他们推到一起，他们的手无意碰到。茱莉娅把温斯顿的指尖很快地握了一下，好像那唤起的并非肉欲，而是爱意。他突然想到男人跟女人一起生活时，像这种感到失望的情形肯定属正常，一再出现。他突然陷入一种涌自内心的柔情，以前他对茱莉娅从未有过这种感觉。他希望他们是已经结了十年婚的夫妻，希望他和她是在大街上一起走着，就像当时一样，然而是正大光明、无所恐惧的，说无关紧要的话，买零零碎碎的家庭用品。他最希望的，是能有个地方让他们可以不受打扰地待在一起，也不用感觉每次非得做爱不可。那天之后的第二天而不是当天，他想到可以租下查林顿先生的房间。向茱莉娅提议时，出乎意料的是她欣然同意。他们两人都明白那是种疯狂而且愚蠢的行为，好像他们故意向自己的坟墓迈近了一步。他坐在床边等待时，他再次想到仁爱部里的牢房。那种注定会至的可怖之事会在一个人的意识里进进出出，这堪称怪事。它就在那里存在着，在未来某个时候，在死亡之前，就跟九十九之后是一百一样绝无差错。你不可能避开它，但有可能把它往后推，然而恰恰相反，人们会时不时在清醒状态下故意缩短这段时间，令其提前发生。

这时，楼梯上响起急促的脚步声，茱莉娅突然进了房间。她挎了个棕色粗帆布工具包，就是他有时看到她在部里上下班挎着的包。他向前一步想把她抱到怀里，她却很着急地挣开，部分原因是她还挎着工具包。

“等会儿，”她说，“给你看看我带了什么来。你有没有带那种垃圾胜利咖啡过来？我想你会。你可以把它扔掉，因为我们不需要了。你看。”

茱莉娅跪在地上一把扯开袋子，把放在上层的扳手和螺丝刀掏出来。下层是几个漂亮的纸包，她递上的第一个小包有种模模糊糊的熟悉感觉，里面装的是某种沉甸甸、沙子一样的东西，摸起来很松软。

“是糖吗？”温斯顿问。

“真正的糖，不是糖精，是糖。这儿还有块面包——正宗的白面包，不是我们吃的那种操蛋玩意儿——还有一小罐果酱，这儿还有一听牛奶——你看！这是我最得意的东西，我非得包上一点儿帆布，因为——”

不过茱莉娅不需要告诉温斯顿为什么要把它包起来，那种气味已经弥漫在整个房间里，一股很浓烈的气味，似乎散发自温斯顿的童年早期，但即使在如今，也的确偶尔会闻到。在某间房门砰的一声关上之前，这种气味会从过道飘来，或者在人群里神秘地弥漫，有一阵子能闻到，然后又闻不到了。

“是咖啡，”他低声说，“真正的咖啡。”

“内党党员喝的咖啡，这儿有整整一公斤。”

“你怎么搞到这些东西的？”

“都是内党党员用的，那些猪猡一样也不缺，没有一样。不过当然还有服务员、仆人以及能偷到东西的人们会有，还有呢——看，我还弄来了一包茶叶。”

温斯顿在她身边蹲下来。他把一小包撕开一角。

“是真正的茶叶，不是黑刺莓叶。”

“最近茶叶很多，他们攻下了印度还是哪里。”她含含糊糊地说，“可是听着，亲爱的，我要你转过身，三分钟别看我。你过去坐在床那边，别太靠近窗户。我叫你转身你再转身。”

温斯顿心不在焉地透过棉布窗帘往外看。下面的院子里，那个红胳膊女人仍在洗衣盆和晾衣服绳之间阔步来回。她又从嘴里取下两个夹子，带着深沉的感情唱道：



他们说时间可以愈合一切，

说你早晚都会忘完。

但是多年前的笑容还有泪水，

仍把我的心儿给搅乱！



她好像把整首愚蠢的歌曲了记于心。她的声音和着怡人的夏日微风往上飘扬，很悦耳，饱含感情，有种半是快乐半是忧郁的味道。人们对她会有种感觉，就是如果夏日傍晚无穷无尽，衣物也取之不完，即使让她那样待上一千年边夹尿布边唱垃圾歌曲，她也会很满足。他突然想到，他从未听过党员一个人自发性地唱歌。这件事说来奇怪，那种行为好像多少有点非正统，是种危险的怪癖，如同自言自语。也许只是当人们接近饿肚子时，才有可以歌唱的事。

“你可以转过身了。”茱莉娅说。

温斯顿转过身，有那么一秒钟，几乎没能认出她来。实际上，他本以为会看到她赤身裸体，然而不是。那种转变比看到她赤身裸体更让人吃惊：她化了妆。

她肯定是溜到群众居住区的某间铺子里买了一整套化妆用品。她的嘴唇涂得鲜红欲滴，脸颊搽了胭脂，鼻子上也扑了粉，甚至眼睛下边也不知用什么描了描，让她的眼睛显得更明亮。她的化妆技巧并不高明，而温斯顿在这方面的欣赏标准也不高。他从未看到或想象过女党员的脸上会用到化妆品。化妆后，她的容貌不知好看了多少。就那样，在合适的地方描上几笔，她不仅漂亮了许多，最重要的是，更有女人味了。她的短头发和男孩式的工作服更是强化了这种效果。他把她搂到怀里时，一股合成的紫罗兰气味蹿进他的鼻孔。他想起那间地下室厨房里半明半暗的感觉，还有那个女人洞穴般的嘴巴。那个女人用的是同样的香水，但在此时，这好像也不重要了。

“还用了香水！”他说。

“对，亲爱的，还用了香水。你知道我接下来要干什么吗？我要找来一件连衣裙穿上，而不是这种操蛋的裤子。我要穿丝袜，还有高跟鞋！在这个房间里，我要做个女人，而不是党员同志。”

他们扯掉身上的衣服并爬到那张特大的红木床上。这是他首次在她面前脱光衣服，在此之前，他一直为自己苍白而瘦削的身子、小腿肚上的静脉曲张和脚脖上方变了颜色的那一块感到很难为情。没有床单，他们躺在其上的毯子尽管破旧，但是平滑。那张床的宽度及弹性让他们两人都很吃惊。“里面肯定长满了臭虫，可是谁会在乎呢？”茱莉娅说。除了在群众的家里，人们现在是看不到双人床了。温斯顿小时候偶尔睡过，茱莉娅就记忆所及，从未睡过双人床。

很快，他们在那里躺着睡了一小会儿。温斯顿醒来时，那座时钟的指针已经溜到差不多七点的位置。他没有动，因为茱莉娅头枕在他的臂弯上睡着了。她脸上化妆品的绝大部分都蹭到了温斯顿的脸上或长枕头上，一道浅浅的胭脂仍让她的颧骨显得美丽。夕阳的一道黄色光线照射在床腿上，照亮了壁炉，锅里的水已经沸腾。下面院子里，那个女人已经不再唱歌，街上却仍然传来隐隐约约的小孩子的叫嚷声。他在模模糊糊琢磨像此时这样，一男一女在夏日傍晚的凉爽空气中不穿衣服躺在床上，想做爱就做爱，想聊什么聊什么，没有觉得必须起来不可，只是躺在那里听外面平和的声音，这在已被消灭的过去是不是种很寻常的体验？肯定从来不会是寻常的，不是吗？茱莉娅醒了，她揉着眼睛，并用胳膊肘撑起身来看油炉。

“水都烧干一半了。”她说，“我过会儿要起来煮点咖啡，我们还有一小时时间。你住的公寓什么时候关灯？”

“二十三点半。”

“宿舍里二十三点关灯。不过必须在那之前回去，因为——嗨！滚开，你这脏东西！”

她突然在床上一扭身从地板上抓起一只鞋子，像男孩子一样突然胳膊一抡把它扔向墙角，跟她那天上午在两分钟仇恨会时，把词典扔向戈斯坦因的动作一模一样。

“什么？”他诧异地问。

“一只老鼠，我看见它从护壁板里伸出鼻子，那里有个洞。不管怎么样，我可是把它吓了一大跳。”

“老鼠！”温斯顿咕哝道，“就在房间里！”

“老鼠到处都有，”茱莉娅又躺下来无所谓地说，“我们宿舍那儿连厨房里都有。伦敦有些地方老鼠已经成灾了。你知不知道它们咬小孩子？真的，真的会。那种地方的街道上，妇女们不敢把婴儿自个儿放下两分钟不管，是那种个头很大、毛是褐色的老鼠干的。最恶心的是，这些东西总——”

“别说了！”温斯顿说着紧紧闭上了眼睛。

“我最亲爱的呀！你脸色苍白，怎么回事？老鼠让你不舒服？”

“世界上最可怕的就数老鼠了！”

她把自己贴紧温斯顿，四肢绞缠在他身上，像是在用她的体温让他放心。他没有马上睁开眼睛，很长一阵子，他有种感觉是回到了他不时会做的噩梦中。基本上总是完全一样：他站在一堵黑暗之墙的前方，墙那边是某种无法忍受、恐怖得不敢面对的东西。在梦里，他最基本的感觉总是在自欺欺人，因为他其实知道那堵黑暗之墙后面是什么。他用尽九牛二虎之力，就像从大脑上扭下来一块，他甚至本来能把那种东西拖出来，但总是在还没有发现那是什么之前醒来，不知为何，它总是跟他打断茱莉娅的话时，她正说着的东西有关。

“对不起，”他说，“没什么，我讨厌老鼠，如此而已。”

“别担心，亲爱的，以后我们不会再有那种脏东西了。走之前，我会用帆布把洞塞住，下次来这儿时，我要带些灰泥把它封得严严实实。”

那个惊慌失措的黑色时刻已经差不多快被忘掉了。他略微感到难为情，靠着床头坐了起来。茱莉娅起了床，穿上工作服开始煮咖啡。深底锅里冒出的气味浓烈而令人兴奋，他们关上窗子，以防别人在外面闻到而好奇。比咖啡味道更好的，是加了糖的绵滑口感。用了许多年糖精后，温斯顿几乎忘了还有糖这种东西。茱莉娅一只手揣在口袋里，另一只手拿着一块抹有果酱的面包在房间里随意走动，冷淡地扫视着书架，指出最好该怎样修理一下那张折叠桌，猛地一下坐到那张破扶手椅里，看它坐着是不是舒服，而且多少算是饶有兴味地研究那座古怪的时钟。她把玻璃镇纸拿到床上，好在亮一点的地方看，他把它从她手里拿过来，它柔和如雨水一般的样子总让他心醉神迷。

“你觉得它是干吗用的？”茱莉娅问他。

“我觉得它什么也不是——我是说我觉得它没做过什么用，这就是我喜欢它的原因。它是他们忘了篡改的一块历史，是来自一百年前的一则信息，如果你知道怎样读的话。”

“那幅画，”她示意对面墙上的版画，“会不会有一百年？”

“还要早些，我想会有两百年。没法确定，如今不可能发现哪样东西有多少年历史了。”

她走过去看那张版画。“那东西就是在这儿露了一下头。”她说着用脚踢了一下那幅画正下方的护壁板。“这是什么地方？我以前在哪儿看到过。”

“那是座教堂，或者至少以前是，叫圣克莱门特的丹麦人。”他又想起查林顿先生教给他的那首押韵诗的片段，有点怀旧似的又说：“‘桔子和柠檬。’圣克莱门特教堂的大钟说！”

让他大吃一惊的是，她往下接道：



“你欠我三个法寻。”圣马丁教堂的大钟说，

“你什么时候还我？”老百利(1)的大钟说——



“我不记得下面是怎么说的了，可我总算还记着最后一句：‘这儿有支蜡烛照着你去睡觉，这儿有把斧头把你的头剁掉！’”

那就像一问一答的口令，但“老百利”那一行后面肯定还有，也许给查林顿先生以适当提示，就能从他的记忆中挖掘出。

“谁教你的？”他问道。

“我爷爷，小时候他经常给我念。我八岁时他被蒸发掉了——不管怎么样，他失踪了。我不知道什么是柠檬。”她又随意说道，“我见过桔子，是圆圆的黄色水果，厚皮。”

“我记得什么是柠檬，”温斯顿说，“五十年代的时候很常见，酸得闻一下就能把牙齿给酸倒。”

“我敢说那张画后面有臭虫，”茱莉娅说，“我哪天把它取下来好好打扫一下。我想差不多该走了，我得马上把化妆洗掉。真烦人！等会儿我再把你脸上的口红擦掉。”

温斯顿在床上又待了几分钟。房间内正在变暗，他往光亮处挪了一点，盯着看那块玻璃镇纸。它让人百看不厌之处，不是珊瑚，而是玻璃内部。它很厚，但又几乎像空气一样透明。那块玻璃的表面像天空的穹顶，包容了一个小小的世界，各种特点无不具备。他感觉能够进入其中，而实际上他已经身处其中，跟那张红木床、折叠桌还有钢雕版版画及镇纸本身一起都在其中。镇纸就是他所在的房间，珊瑚是茱莉娅和他自己的生命，被固定在清澈透明的玻璃中心，并成为一种永恒之物。

第五章


塞姆消失了。有天上午，他没上班，几个不长脑子的还在议论他怎么不来上班，第二天就没人再提起他。第三天，温斯顿去档案司的前厅看布告牌。其中有则布告是印出来的象棋委员会成员名单，塞姆一直是其中一员。它看上去跟以前的成员名单一模一样——除了少一个名字，什么都没划掉。这就够了，塞姆已不复存在，他从未存在过。

天气炎热难耐。迷宫般的部里面，没窗户的空调房间里保持正常温度，但外面的人行道能灼伤行人的脚板，高峰时地铁里的恶臭更是能把人熏死。为仇恨周的准备活动进行得如火似荼，部里所有工作人员都在加班加点工作。游行，开会，阅兵，演讲，蜡像展览，电影展，电屏节目，这些都得安排。还必须搭起摊位、制作模拟像、撰写标语、谱写歌曲、散播谣言、伪造照片，等等。小说司里茱莉娅所在的部门已经暂停长篇小说生产，而是赶制出一系列有关敌人暴行的小册子。温斯顿在正常工作之外，每天花费大量时间翻看过去《泰晤士报》的档案，对将在讲话里引用的新闻进行改动或者润饰。一群群喧闹的群众深夜在街上闲逛时，市里有了种奇特的火热气氛。跟以前比起来，火箭弹轰炸得更频繁了，有时候在很远的地方，还传来巨大的爆炸声。谁都不明所以，因此谣言四起。

一首即将作为仇恨周主题歌的新歌（叫做《仇恨之歌》）已经谱写出来，正在电屏上没完没了地播放。它有种野蛮的、咆哮般的节奏，不能准确称之为音乐，而和擂鼓声音类似，它和着行军步伐声由几百个嗓门吼出来，令人不寒而栗。群众一下子就喜欢上了它，在午夜大街上，它和仍受欢迎的《这不过是种无用的幻想》此起彼伏。帕森斯家的孩子用梳子和一片卫生纸没日没夜地吹，令人无法忍受。温斯顿晚上比以前更忙碌了。由帕森斯组织的一队队志愿者在为仇恨周布置街道、缝旗帜、贴宣传画、在楼顶上树旗杆，还冒着危险在街道上拉铁丝以拦截火箭弹。帕森斯吹嘘说单在胜利大厦，就要亮出四百米长的彩旗。他本性尽显，快乐得像只百灵鸟，炎热加上体力劳动，让他有借口在晚上穿回了短裤和开领衬衫。他无处不在，总在推、拉、锯、砸、即兴出点子、跟每个人说笑并佐以同志式的鼓励，而且从他身上每处褶子，都在向外散发着似乎源源不绝的刺鼻汗臭。

一张宣传画突然出现在伦敦各处，没有说明文字，只有一个面目狰狞的欧亚国士兵形象，有三四米高，长着一张面无表情的蒙古人种脸庞，脚蹬巨大的皮靴，正在大步往前跨，冲锋枪端在臀部的高度。不管从哪个角度看这张宣传画，被用透视画法放大的冲锋枪枪口总是正对着你。这张宣传画已经贴上了每堵墙上的空处，甚至在数量上超过了老大哥的肖像画。群众一向对战争缺乏兴趣，这次也被鞭策进入周期性的爱国主义狂热中。似乎要与普遍的精神状态保持一致，这一回火箭弹比以前炸死的人更多。有一颗落到了位于斯泰普尼区的一间电影院，几百人被埋在废墟之下。那一带居住的所有人都上街参加了一次绵延不绝的葬礼，为时几小时之久，葬礼实际上变成了泄愤大会。还有颗炸弹落到一块作为游乐场的废地上，几十个小孩子被炸成碎块。后来又举行了几次愤怒的示威活动，戈斯坦因的模拟像被烧，几百张欧亚国士兵的宣传画被撕下来以助火势，有些商店在混乱中被洗劫。后来还有传闻，说有间谍在通过无线电为火箭弹指引方向。有对老夫妇被怀疑有外国血统，他们的房子因此被烧毁，两人都窒息而死。

查林顿先生铺子上面那个房间里，每次他们只要能去，就会并排躺在打开的窗户下面那张没铺床单的床上，为了凉爽而赤着身子。老鼠再也没有露过头，臭虫却在炎热中猛烈繁殖，但好像那也无关紧要。不管肮脏还是干净，那个房间就是天堂。他们一到，便用黑市上买来的胡椒粉到处撒了一些，然后扯掉衣服汗流浃背地做爱。睡了一觉后，会发现臭虫正在集结，准备大规模反攻呢。

六月份，他们幽会了六七次。温斯顿戒掉了不分什么时候都喝酒的习惯，似乎不再有那种需要。他长胖了一点，静脉曲张溃疡也好了，脚脖上方的皮肤上，只留下褐色的一小块，早上的那阵咳嗽发作也不再有。日常生活不再不可忍受，他也不再有向电屏做鬼脸，或者扯着嗓子喊脏话的冲动了。他们现在有了个安全的藏身之地，几乎像是个家，就连他们的见面次数很少，以及每次只能在一起几个小时，也好像不算是件苦事。重要的是铺子上面那个房间还存在，知道它还在那里，完整无损，就几乎相当于已身处其内。那个房间自成一统，是一块袖珍的过去，绝了种的动物可以在其中徜徉。温斯顿想到查林顿先生就是另外一种绝种动物，上楼前，他通常总要跟查林顿先生说上几分钟话。老头儿似乎很少或者说从不外出，另一方面，他好像几乎没什么顾客。他像个鬼魂般，活在很小的阴暗铺子里和更小的厨房之间，他在那间厨房里做饭，里面除了别的东西，还有台老得让人不敢相信的留声机，有个巨大的喇叭。他好像为有机会说话而高兴。在那堆分文不值的货品中间走动时，他长长的鼻子、厚厚的眼镜片，套着丝绒夹克的肩膀弯得低低，总让他隐约有种收藏家的样子，而不是个生意人。他会以略带热情的神态，用手指摸弄一片废品之类的东西——瓷制瓶塞，破鼻烟壶涂了颜色的盖子，仿金项链盒，里面放着一绺某个久已不在人世的婴孩的头发——从来不说温斯顿应该买下，而是说他应该欣赏一下。跟他说话，就像听一个破旧的音乐盒发出的叮当声。他从自己的记忆角落里，又扯出一些已被忘掉的押韵诗片段，一首关于二十四只黑八哥，一首关于长着弯弯角的奶牛，还有一首关于可怜的公知更鸟之死。“我刚好想到您也许感兴趣。”每次他想起新的一首时，就会自我解嘲地轻轻笑着这样说，不过他从来只能记起几行而已。

他们两人都知道——从某种意义上说，从来不曾忘记——现状不会长久。有时，死亡正在迫近这一事实似乎跟他们躺在身下的那张床一样触摸得到，他们会以绝望般的纵欲心理紧紧搂抱，就像一个将入地狱的灵魂在钟声敲响前五分钟，紧紧抓住最后些许快乐。然而还有些时候，他们不仅幻想自己是安全的，还幻想会是天长地久。只要能真的待在这个房间里，两人都感觉不会身遭不测。去那个房间不容易，也是危险的，但它本身是个避难所。温斯顿盯着玻璃镇纸中心时，感觉好像能进入那个玻璃世界，一到里面，时间就可以凝固。他们经常随心所欲地做起关于逃避的白日梦，他们的好运将永远持续下去，他们会像这样，在余生继续这种秘密行为。要么凯瑟琳会死去，通过精心的安排，他和茱莉娅能结成婚，要么会一同自杀，要么会藏匿起来，把自己改变得让别人认不出，学会用群众的口音说话，在一间工厂找到工作，然后在某条小街上不为人察地过一辈子。那全是胡思乱想，他们也都知道，现实中，他们无路可逃。即使是唯一可行的计划，即自杀，他们也无意行之。一天天，一周周，得过且过，在没有未来的当下消磨度日，这似乎是种不可遏止的本能，好像只要有空气，人的肺总要吸进下一口空气一样。

有时，他们也会谈论要采取积极行动跟党对着干，然而对如何走出第一步心里无数。就算传言中的兄弟会真的存在，如何加入仍是个难题。他跟她说了他和奥布兰之间有着或者说似乎有着的奇特亲近感，还有他时不时会感到的那种冲动，简单说来，就是走到奥布兰面前，宣称自己是党的敌人，并请他帮助自己。很奇怪的是，这在她看来并不是种轻率之极的举动。她习惯从别人的面庞来判断别人，对她来说，温斯顿因为一个眼神而认为奥布兰可以信赖是再正常不过的事。再者，她想当然认为每个人，或者说几乎每个人私下都仇恨党，觉得安全的话，都会违犯规定。但她不相信存在或者有可能存在广泛而有组织的反抗活动。她说关于戈斯坦因及其地下部队的传言都无非是一派胡言，是党为了自身目的编造出来的，你不得不装作相信。在无数次党的集会以及自发示威活动中，她一直是用最大嗓门呼喊的那群人之一，要求处死她从未听说过其名字的人，但对他们据称犯下的罪行，她却一点也不相信。进行公审时，她参加了青年团派出的分队，从早到晚包围着法院，隔一阵就呼喊：“处死卖国贼！”两分钟仇恨会里，她在大声辱骂戈斯坦因方面，总比别人喊得响，但对戈斯坦因是何人，以及他代表何种主义只有极为模糊的印象。她是革命后长大的，年轻得不记得五六十年代时发生过的意识形态之战，她无法想象会有这种独立的政治运动，再说党无往而不胜，是千秋万代、永恒不变的，你只能通过私下的不服从来反抗它，最多通过像杀死某个人或炸掉某物这种个别暴力行为来反抗。

某些方面说来，她比温斯顿更敏锐，而且远远地更不被党的宣传所蛊惑。有一次，他刚好说到某件事时，提到了跟欧亚国的战争，让他震惊的，是她随随便便地说在她看来，并没有进行什么战争，落到伦敦的火箭弹很可能是大洋国政府自己放的，“只是为了让人们继续生活在恐惧中”，这种看法他实际上从未有过。她还说她在两分钟仇恨会里最感困难的，是克制住想放声大笑的冲动，这让他略微有了羡慕的感觉。但她只是在党的教义以某种方式对她自己的生活造成影响时，才会质疑它。一般情况下，她易于接受官方编造的鬼话，但那只是因为真相和谎言之间的区别对她来说，似乎并不重要。例如，她相信在学校里学到过是党发明了飞机。（温斯顿记得五十年代后期他上学时，党只声称发明了直升飞机，过了十几年，茱莉娅上学时，党已经声称发明了飞机，而对下一代人，党会声称发明了蒸汽机。）他告诉她在他出生之前和革命以前飞机很早就已存在时，在她眼里，这一事实完全没意思。从她偶尔的说话中，他发现她不记得大洋国四年前是跟东亚国打仗、跟欧亚国处于和平状态，这让他更为吃惊。没错，她认为整场战争都是假的，但显然根本没注意到敌国的名字已经改变。“我以为我们一直在跟欧亚国打仗。”她含含糊糊地说。这让他有点吃惊，飞机的发明是在她出生前很久，但战争对象的改变才是四年前的事，是在她早已成年之后。他跟她争辩也许有一刻钟之久，到最后，他总算成功复苏了她的回忆，她确实朦朦胧胧想起来敌国一度是东亚国而不是欧亚国，但这点在她看来仍是无关紧要。“谁在乎呢？”她不耐烦地说，“总是一次操蛋的战争接着一次，不管怎么样，我们知道新闻全是谎话。”

有时，他告诉她关于档案司和他在那里从事无耻伪造活动的事，好像也没能吓坏她。想到谎言正变成事实时，她并未感受到正在她脚下扩张的深渊。他告诉她关于琼斯、艾朗森和鲁瑟福的事，还有他在手里拿过一阵子的纸条，但都没给她留下什么印象。事实上，从一开始，她就没领会他讲述这件事意图何在。

“他们跟你是朋友吗？”她问道。

“不，我从来不认识他们。他们是内党党员，再说年纪比我大多了，属于革命以前的旧时代，在革命之前。我只是知道他们长什么样。”

“那干吗要担心？什么时候都有人被杀，不是吗？”

他又试图让她明白：“这是个例外情况，不仅是某个人被杀的问题，你有没有意识到从昨天往前的过去实际上都已经被消灭了？如果它在什么地方存在，那会是在少数实实在在的东西上，没有文字说明，像那块玻璃一样。我们现在对革命和革命以前的年代实际上已经什么都不记得了。所有档案要么被销毁，要么被伪造。每本书都被重写过，每幅画都被重画过，每座雕塑、每条街以及每座建筑都被重新命名过，每个日期都被改动过，而且这种过程每天每分钟都在进行。历史已经停止，除了无休无止的现在，其他一切都不存在，而党在这种现在中永远正确。当然我知道过去是伪造的，可我永远证明不了这点，即便我自己也在从事伪造活动。这件事完成后，没有证据会留下来。唯一的证据在我自己的内心里，而且我也无法肯定是不是还有别人和我有着同样的记忆。我一辈子只有那次在事情发生之后——许多年以后——拥有过确确实实的证据。”

“那又有什么用？”

“没用，因为我几分钟后就把它扔掉了。可要是如今再遇到这种事，我会把它保存下去。”

“这个嘛，我是不会的！”茱莉娅说，“我很愿意冒险，但是只为值得一干的事，而不是为了几片旧报纸。你保存下来的话，会怎么处理？”

“可能也不会怎么处理，但它是证据。假如我敢把它拿给别人看，它也许会在这儿那儿播下一些怀疑的种子。我想象不到我们这辈子能改变什么，但是可以想象这儿那儿会产生小小的反抗情绪——一小群一小群人结合起来，然后慢慢发展壮大，甚至在身后留下一些记录，让下一代能继承我们未竟的事业。”

“我对下一代不感兴趣，亲爱的，我只对我们感兴趣。”

“你腰部以下才是个造反派。”他告诉她。

她觉得这句话异常精彩，高兴得一把抱住他。

她对党的说教带来的后果一点也没兴趣。每次他一开始说起英社的原则、双重思想、过去的易变性、对客观现实的否认以及使用新话单词时，她就变得厌倦和困惑。她说她从未留意过那种事情，但是既然知道全是垃圾，干吗还要让自己操那份心呢？她知道什么时候欢呼，什么时候发出嘘声就够了。如果他非要谈论这种事，她有个让人难堪的习惯，就是会睡着，她是那种可以在任何地点、任何时间睡着的人。通过跟她谈话，他意识到在根本不知道正统为何的情况下，摆出一副正统的样子有多么容易。从某种意义上说，党强加于人的世界观在无法理解它的人们那里最容易被接受。他们被迫接受最明目张胆的指鹿为马的行径，因为他们从未全面理解对他们犯下的是何等滔天大罪，而且也因为对天下大事关心不够，没注意到正在发生何事。靠着缺乏理解力，他们仍保持清醒，只是轻信一切，而他们所轻信的也不会留下什么，如同一粒谷物不经消化通过小鸟的身体那样。





第六章


终于发生了，那个等待中的信息已经来了。他觉得似乎已经等了一辈子。

当时他正顺着部里的长走廊走着，几乎走到茱莉娅塞给他纸条的地方，他感到某个体形比他大的人紧跟在他身后。那个人——不管是谁——轻轻咳了一下，显然是准备说话。温斯顿猛地停步一转身，是奥布兰。

他们终于面对面了，而他唯一的冲动像是要跑掉。他的心脏猛烈跳动着，无法开口讲话。但奥布兰继续以同样步伐走着，友好地把手在温斯顿的手臂上搭了一会儿，所以两人是在并肩走着。他开始以一种奇特的严肃然而彬彬有礼的方式开口说话，这一点让他跟大多数内党党员显得不一样。

“我一直想找机会跟您谈谈，”他说，“我最近读了您在《泰晤士报》上写的新话文章。我想您对新话有种学术方面的兴趣，对不对？”

温斯顿部分恢复了常态。“谈不上学术方面，”他说，“我只是个业余爱好者。那不是我的专业，我从来没参加过这种语言的具体构建工作。”

“您写得倒是很得体，”奥布兰说，“这不只是我的看法。我最近跟您的一个朋友谈过，他没说的，是个专家，可是我这会儿想不起他叫什么。”

温斯顿的心里痛苦地颤动了一下，这句话指的如果不是塞姆，那才是不可想象。但塞姆不止是死了，而且被消灭了，是个“非人”，只要明显提及他，都会带来生命危险。奥布兰的那句话显然意在发出一个信号、一个暗语。通过一同犯下一点点思想罪，他把他们两个人变成了共犯。他们本来在继续顺走廊走着，这时奥布兰停下脚步推了推眼镜，这种动作他总能奇怪地做得很亲切，能让人消除戒心。接着他又说道：

“我真正想说的是，您那篇文章里，用了两个已经过时的词，不过只是最近才过时的。您有没有看过《新话词典》第十版？”

“没有，”温斯顿说，“我想还没有发行吧，在档案司，我们用的还是第九版。”

“我想第十版要过几个月才会出，不过已经有一批提前发行了，我自己就有一本。您也许有兴趣看一看？”

“很有兴趣，”温斯顿答道，马上明白了这话意图何在。

“有些新发展最具天才性。关于削减动词数量这一点——我觉得您会对这一点感兴趣。让我看看，要不我派人把词典送给您？不过这种事我恐怕肯定会忘记，也许您可以在方便的时候，来我住的地方拿？等一下，我给您写我的地址。”

他们正好站在电屏前。奥布兰有点心不在焉地摸了摸他的两个口袋，然后掏出一个皮面笔记薄和一杆金色的墨水笔。他潦草地写下了地址。他就站在电屏下方，那个位置能让电屏设备那端的人读到他写的是什么。然后他把那页撕下来递给温斯顿。

“我晚上一般都在家，”他又说，“不在家的话，我的仆人会把词典给您。”

他走了，留下温斯顿拿着那片纸，这次不需要藏起来了。不过他还是仔细记下上面所写的东西，几小时后把它和别的东西一起丢进了记忆洞。

他们两人的交谈最多有几分钟，这节插曲只可能具有一种意义，即这是为了让温斯顿知道奥布兰的地址的一个方法，是计划好的。这有必要，因为除非直接询问，否则总是不可能知道别人住在哪里，根本没有什么地址录。“想跟我见面的话，可以来这儿找我。”那是奥布兰对他说的话。也许甚至在词典里的某处，会藏了某种信息。但不管怎么样，有一件事确定无疑，那就是他一直想象的地下串联活动的确存在，而他已经摸到了它的外缘。

他知道或早或晚，他会听从奥布兰的召唤，也许是明天，也许是过了很久以后——他不能肯定。正在发生的事是水到渠成的结果而已，这一进程几年前就开始了。第一步是私下的一个无意识想法，第二步是开始记日记。他已经把想法付诸文字，现在是把文字付诸行动了。最后一步是发生在仁爱部的某种事情，他已经接受了这个结局，它包含在开始中，但那令人恐惧，要么更准确地说，像是先尝了口死亡，像有点没那么有活力了。即使在他跟奥布兰说话时，当他已经明白话里的意思时，他陷入一种冰冷的战栗感，有种感觉是踏进了坟墓的潮气中，就算他一直知道坟墓就在那里，也没能让他感觉好很多。





第七章


温斯顿醒来时，眼里全是泪水，茱莉娅睡意朦胧地翻个身贴近他，嘴里咕哝着什么，似乎在说：“怎么了？”

“我梦到——”他一开口马上又打住。它复杂得无法用言语讲述。一方面是所做的梦，另一方面是与之相关的记忆。醒来后的几秒钟内，那些记忆进入了他的脑海。

他又躺在那里，眼睛闭着，仍然沉浸在梦境的气氛里。那是个庞杂而亮堂的梦，他的整个人生似乎在他面前展开了，就像夏天雨后傍晚时分的一带风景，全展现在玻璃镇纸内。玻璃的表面就像天空的穹顶，在此穹顶下，万物都沐浴在清晰柔和的光线中，从那里，可以看到无限远的地方。这个梦境也是包含在——确实，从某种意义上说它存在于——他母亲的手臂动作里，三十年后，这个动作是由他在电影上看到的那个犹太女人做出的，她在试图为小男孩挡住子弹，就在直升飞机将他们两人炸成碎片之前。

“你知道吗？”他说，“直到现在，我仍然相信是我害死了我妈。”

“你为什么要害死她？”茱莉娅问道，她几乎已经睡着。

“我没有害死她，不是在实际意义上。”

在梦里，他想起他对母亲的最后一瞥，睡醒前的一小段时间里，许多围绕着那一瞥的小事情都想起来了。就是那种记忆，许多年来，他一定都在有意识地将其从自己的意识里排除出去。他不能肯定那件事发生在哪一年，当时他不会比十岁还小，也许是十二岁吧。

温斯顿的父亲早些时候失踪了，他也不记得有多早。但是他记得那时令人不安的喧嚣情形：周期性的空袭带来的惊慌和到地铁站躲避，处处都有一堆堆瓦砾，街角张贴着看不明白的公告，一群群身穿同样颜色衬衫的少年，面包店外极长的队，远处断断续续的机关枪声——而最重要的，是从来填不饱肚子这件事实。他记得在漫长的下午和别的男孩一起，到处翻垃圾筒和垃圾堆找卷心菜梗和土豆皮的事，有时甚至能找到陈面包皮，他们会小心地把上面的煤灰擦掉。还去等候经过某条路的卡车开来，他们知道车上装的是喂牲畜的饲料，有时，当卡车开到起伏不平的路段时，会颠出几块油饼。

他父亲失踪后，他母亲并未表现出惊讶或者呼天抢地的悲痛，但在她身上，也发生了突变。她似乎变得完全无精打采，就连温斯顿也能看出，她在等候她已经明白必将发生的事情。她做着需要做的一切——做饭，洗涤，缝补，铺床，扫地，给壁炉台拂尘——总是做得很缓慢，奇怪地没有多余的动作，就好像一个艺术家的人体模型在自行动着。她那庞大匀称的身体似乎能自行恢复静止。她会一连几个钟头坐在床上，几乎一动不动地照看他的妹妹。他妹妹的身子骨很小，病恹恹的，很少出声，两三岁大，由于瘦，让她的脸长得像猴子脸。时不时地，他母亲会把温斯顿揽到怀里，很长时间紧搂着他，一句话也不说。虽然年纪小而且自私，但他也意识到不知为何，这跟那件从未提到过的、即将发生的事情有关。

他记起他们住过的房间，那是个阴暗而且空气不流通的房间，好像那张铺着白色床单的床占了一半地方。壁炉挡板那边有个煤气灶，还有块放食物的搁板。门外平台那里，有个褐色的陶制水池，跟其他几个房间的一样。他记得母亲那雕像般的身躯在煤气灶前弯着，在搅动炖锅里的什么东西。他记得最清楚的是他从未吃饱过肚子，还有吃饭时候进行的凶狠抢夺。他会纠缠不休地问母亲为何没有吃的了，会向她大吵大闹（他甚至还记得他的嗓音，那时候开始提前变声，有时候奇怪地瓮声瓮气的），或者是他试图以悲切切的啜泣来争取超过自己的应得份额。他的母亲也很愿意给他超过应得的份额，理所当然认为他——“男孩子”——应该得到最大份额，然而不管给他多少，他总会要求更多。每次吃饭时，他母亲都会恳求他别自私，要记着他的小妹妹还在生病，也要吃东西，可是没有用。她不再给他舀饭时，他会发怒地哭喊，用力想把锅和勺子从她手里夺过来，还会从他妹妹的盘子里抓一点。他也知道他在让她们两人挨饿，可他忍不住，甚至觉得他有权那样做，他那种饥肠辘辘的感觉好像让他可以理直气壮那样做。在两顿饭的间隔，他母亲没看好的话，他还会不时偷拿一些搁板上放的少得可怜的食物。

有一天，配给的巧克力发下来了，过去几周或者几个月里都未发过。他记得很清楚那珍贵的一小片巧克力。他们三个人分的是两盎司重的一片（那年头他们还用盎司计重），显然应该平分成三份。突然，像是听从别的什么人的话，温斯顿听到自己在以瓮声瓮气的大嗓门要求得到整块。母亲告诉他别太贪心。他们没完没了争辩了很长时间，有过喊叫、呜咽、流泪、抗议、讨价还价，等等。他长得极瘦小的妹妹双手抱着母亲，恰似一只小猴子，她坐在那里扭着头用大而忧伤的眼睛看着。到最后，他母亲把巧克力掰四分之三给了温斯顿，剩下的四分之一给了他妹妹。那个小女孩拿着巧克力木然看着，似乎不知道那是什么。温斯顿站在那里看了一会，然后突然迅速跳起来，从她手里抢过巧克力就往门口跑去。

“温斯顿，温斯顿！”他母亲在身后叫他，“回来！把妹妹的巧克力还给她！”

他停下脚步，然而没回去。他母亲那双焦急的眼睛在盯着他。甚至到现在，他还想着那件事，但在即将发生时，他仍不知道是种什么事。他妹妹意识到被抢走了什么东西，开始细声细气地哭了起来。他母亲用胳膊搂着那个孩子，把她的脸贴向自己的乳房，那个动作里的某一方面告诉他妹妹快死了。他转身跑下楼梯，手里的巧克力变得黏乎乎的。

他再也没有见过他的母亲。三口两口吃完巧克力后，他感到有点羞愧，在街上闲逛了几小时，直到最后肚子饿得让他又回到家里。到家后却找不到母亲，这在当时已经是种正常现象。房间里什么也没少，只是他母亲和妹妹不见了。她们什么衣服也没带走，甚至没带走他母亲的大衣。直到今天，他仍不能肯定他母亲是不是已经死了，完全有可能的是她被送进了劳改营。至于他妹妹，可能像温斯顿一样，被转移到一处无家可归儿童的集中地（被称为感化中心），是因为内战而设立的。要么可能跟母亲一起被送进了劳改营，要么只是被扔到哪里，任其死去。

那梦境在温斯顿的脑海里依然生动，特别是手臂的遮挡保护动作，其中包含了梦境的全部意义。他又想起两个月前的另外一个梦。那次，他母亲坐在一艘沉船上，跟她坐在那张铺着白色被子的肮脏床上的样子一模一样，他的小妹妹仍在贴着她，是在他下面很深的地方，而且每分钟都在下沉，但她仍透过颜色越来越深的水看着他。

他告诉茱莉娅他母亲失踪的事。她也没有睁开眼，只是翻了个身以便睡得更舒服。

“我估计你当时是个让人讨厌的小猪猡，”她吐字不清地说，“所有小孩儿都是猪猡。”

“对，可我讲这件事的意思不在于此。”

茱莉娅呼吸的样子显然说明她又快睡着了，他也不想继续谈论他的母亲。根据他所记得的，他估计她没什么特别之处，也不会是个聪明的人，然而拥有一种高贵和纯洁的气质，那只是因为她遵循的是自己的标准，她的感情是她自己的，无法从外部来改变。她不会想到一个行动既然没用，就毫无意义。你爱一个人，就去爱他，你什么也不能给他时，你仍然给他以爱。当最后一块巧克力也没了时，他母亲用胳膊搂紧她的小孩。那没用，并不会因此产生出多一点巧克力，也不会让她或她的小孩免于一死，然而她那样做似乎是自然而然的事。小艇上那个逃难妇女用手臂遮住她的儿子，在抵挡子弹方面，不会比一张纸更有效。党所做的最坏之事，是说服人们仅靠冲动或感情解决不了任何问题，而同时让你在现实世界上变得彻底软弱无力。一旦落入党的手里，你感觉到什么或者没感觉到什么，你做了或者控制住没做什么，那都完全无关紧要。不管发生什么事，你是消失得无影无踪了，你和你的行为从此湮没无闻，你被不留痕迹地从历史河流中清除掉。然而对仅仅两代之前的人来说，这点似乎并非很重要，因为他们无意篡改历史，他们遵从的，是个人之间的忠诚，从来不会对之怀疑。重要的是个人之间的关系，一个完全徒劳的动作、一个拥抱、一滴眼泪、向垂死之人所说的一句话，等等，都具有自身的价值。他突然想到，群众保持着这样，他们不会忠诚于一个党、一个国家或者一种思想，他们互相忠诚。他不再看不起群众，或者只是把他们看做一种早晚会猛醒并改造世界的惰性力量，这在他是第一次。群众仍保持有人性，他们的内心没有硬化，一直怀着朴素的感情，而他温斯顿却需要通过自觉努力再次学到。想到这点时，也没有什么明显的联系，他就想到几周前看到人行道上的一只断手时，他是怎样把它踢到阴沟里的，似乎那是条卷心菜梗。

“群众是人，”他大声说，“我们不是。”

“为什么？”茱莉娅问道，她又醒了。

他想了一小会儿。“你有没有想到过，”他说，“对我们来说，最好是在还得及之前离开这儿，以后永远不再见面？”

“对，亲爱的，我想到过，想过很多次。可是不管怎样，我都不会那样做。”

“我们运气好，”他说，“不过好运气持续不了很久。你还年轻，看上去正常而且清白，如果能和我这种人保持距离，你有可能再活五十年。”

“不，我全想到过。你干什么，我也干什么。你别太沮丧，我的生存能力强着呢。”

“我们也许能够再在一起半年或者一年，不晓得，可是最终我们还是注定会分开。你有没有意识到我们将何等孤立？他们抓了我们后，我们谁都没办法为对方做些什么，绝对什么也不能。如果我坦白，他们会枪毙你，如果我不坦白，他们一样会枪毙你。我能做什么或说什么，或者我不说什么，都绝对无法把你的死推迟五分钟。我们两个人甚至不会知道对方是死了还是活着，我们会完全无能为力，不过有一点是重要的，那就是我们不会互相背叛，虽然这点也不会影响结果。”

“如果你说的是坦白，”她说，“我们会坦白的，没错。每个人都会，你无法坚持不坦白，他们会拷打你。”

“我不是说坦白，坦白不是背叛。你说了什么没说什么都无关紧要：要紧的只有感情。可他们无法让我不爱你，那会是真正的背叛。”

她想了一下。“他们做不到，”她最后说，“那件事他们做不到。他们能强迫你说出任何话——任何话——却无法强迫你心里也相信，他们进入不了你内心。”

“对，”他说道，心里也多了点希望。“对，非常正确。他们进入不了你内心。如果你能觉得保持人性是值得的，即使那也不能带来任何结果，你就已经打败了他们。”

他想到了永远在监听的电屏，他们可以日日夜夜监视你，但只要你能保住项上人头，就仍然能智胜他们。他们尽管聪明绝顶，却仍然未能掌握如何发现另一个人心里在想什么的秘密。也许等你真正落到他们手里后，就并非绝对如此了。人们不知道在仁爱部会遭遇到什么，不过可以猜到：拷打，药品，记录你的神经反应的精密仪器，通过不让睡觉、单独监禁以及无休止的审讯一步步击垮你。不管怎样，你无法守住一直不说实话，他们会用审讯挖出来，用拷打的办法从你嘴里撬出来。但如果目标不是求得活命，而是保持人性，说到底，那又有什么关系？他们无法改变你的感情，在此问题上，就连你也不能改变自己的感情，即使你心里想。他们能够详细至极地挖出你所做、所说及所想的任何事，然而你内心仍然不可征服，它的运转即使对你自己来说，也属神秘莫测。





第八章


他们来了，到底还是来了！

他们站在一个长方形房间内，灯光柔和，电屏的声音关得很小，华美的深蓝色地毯给人一种像是走在天鹅绒上的感觉。在房间内的远端，奥布兰正坐在一张桌子前，在一盏带有绿色灯罩的电灯下工作着，左右两边都有一堆文件。仆人领茱莉娅及温斯顿进去时，他也没有费神抬头看。

温斯顿的心脏扑通扑通跳得很厉害，他怀疑自己是否还能开口说话。他们来了，到底还是来了，那是他唯一的想法。来这里已经算是够轻率的，两人一起来，就更是愚蠢，尽管他们来时，确实走了不同的路线，只是在奥布兰的门口会合。单单走进这样一个地方，就需要鼓足勇气才行，从里面看一眼内党党员所住的地方，或者说就连进入他们所住的这一区，都是很少有的事。巨大的公寓楼房的总体气氛，所有东西的华美感和宽敞感，好食物、好烟丝的陌生气味，无声而且快得令人难以置信的电梯滑上滑下，身穿白色短上装的仆人匆匆来去——一切都令人生畏。虽然来这里有很好的借口，他还是每走一步都担心墙角会突然冒出一个身穿黑色制服的警卫，要求看他的证件并命令他滚开。但奥布兰的仆人没犹豫就让他们进去了。他是个身穿白色短上装的黑头发矮个男人，长了张全无表情的菱形面孔，也许是个中国人。他领他们走过的那条过道上，铺着柔软的地毯，墙上贴着奶黄色墙纸，还有白色护墙板，全都一尘不染，同样令人生畏。温斯顿记得他所见过的墙壁无一例外，都被许多人的身体蹭得脏乎乎的。

奥布兰的手指间捏了张纸条，好像正在专心看。他那张凝重的脸庞俯视着，以至于能看到他鼻子的轮廓，样子既令人敬畏，又是聪明的。在可能有二十秒的时间里，他坐在那里一动不动，然后他把口述记录器拉向自己，用部里的混合行话叽里咕噜说了一通：

“项目一逗号五逗号七批准句号建议包括第六项加加荒谬近于罪想取消句号前所未有建设性不取加满估计机械顶上句号通知结束。”

他不慌不忙从椅子上起身，走过不发出脚步声的地毯到了他们面前。说完那些新话单词后，他身上好像少了点官气，脸色却比平时更为阴沉，似乎因为被打扰而感到不快。温斯顿内心已有的恐惧好像突然被一种正常的尴尬所取代。在他看来，似乎很有可能他完全犯了个愚蠢的错误，他又有什么实实在在的证据，认定奥布兰会是某种政治反叛者呢？除了一个眼神，和仅仅一句意义模糊的话语外一无所有，剩下的只是他内心的想象，建立在一个梦境的基础上。他甚至无法退一步假装他是来借词典的，因为那样的话，就无法解释茱莉娅何以跟他一起来了。奥布兰走过电屏时，似乎突然想到什么。他停下脚步，转身按下电屏上的一个开关，只听得一声脆响，那个声音停止了。

茱莉娅因为惊诧而轻轻尖叫了一声。温斯顿已经感到恐慌，但还是震惊得不由脱口而出：

“您可以把它关掉！”他说。

“对，”奥布兰说，“我们可以把它关掉，我们有这个特权。”

他这时正对着他们，魁梧的身体矗立在他们两人面前，他脸上的表情仍然不可捉摸。他有点是在严肃地等温斯顿说话，可是说什么好呢？即使是现在，很有可能的是他这位忙人正恼火地琢磨他们为何要来打扰他。谁也没说话，电屏关掉后，房间里是死一般的沉寂，每一秒都好像过得很慢。温斯顿费力地仍然直盯着奥布兰的眼睛。接着那张阴沉的面孔突然放松了，似乎接下来就要微笑。奥布兰推了一下眼镜，那是他特有的动作。

“我先说还是您先说？”他说。

“我先说吧。”温斯顿马上说，“那个真的关了吗？”

“对，全关了。只有我们。”

“我们来这儿是因为——”

他顿了一下，首次意识到自己动机的模糊性。因为实际上，他不知道他指望能从奥布兰这里得到什么样的帮助，所以难以讲出自己来这里的原因。他继续开口说话，也意识到他一定说得既有气无力，又矫揉造作。

“我们相信存在着某种串联活动，某种与党对抗的地下组织，而且相信您有所参与，我们想加入，为它工作。我们与党为敌，不相信英社的原则，是思想犯，也是通奸者。我告诉您这些，是因为我们想把自己交给您听凭您发落，如果您觉得我们是自投罗网，我们也认了。”

他有种感觉门被打开了，他停下来扭头瞟了一眼。一点没错，那个黄面孔矮个仆人没敲门就进来了，温斯顿看到他拿了个托盘，上面有一个玻璃瓶和几个玻璃杯。

“马丁是我们的人，”奥布兰淡淡地说，“酒拿过来，马丁。放在圆桌上。这儿椅子够不够？我们最好还是坐下来舒舒服服地谈。给你自己搬张椅子进来，马丁。这是正事，你可以暂停十分钟不做仆人了。”

矮个子男人动作很自然地坐了下来，但仍然有种仆人式的神态，是仆从享受到另眼相待时的神态。温斯顿拿眼角瞄着他。他突然想到那人一辈子都在扮演一个角色，觉得即使仅仅暂时放下装扮的身份，也是危险的。奥布兰手握玻璃瓶的瓶颈，把一种深红色液体倒进几个玻璃杯。这一动作唤起了温斯顿的模糊记忆，就是很久以前在墙上或是广告牌上看到过的——一个由电灯拼成的巨大瓶子似乎在上下动着，把里面的东西倒进杯子。从上方看，那东西几乎是黑色的，在玻璃瓶内，却闪着红宝石般的光芒，有种又酸又甜的味道。他看到茱莉娅拿起她那杯很好奇地闻了闻。

“这叫葡萄酒，”奥布兰带着一丝不易察觉的微笑说，“你们肯定在书本上读到过，不过恐怕外党党员很少能喝到。”他的脸色又沉下来，却又举起酒杯。“我觉得应该先让我们为健康干杯，祝我们的领袖，也就是伊曼纽尔·戈斯坦因身体健康。”

温斯顿多少有点急切地举起他那杯酒。葡萄酒是种他读到也梦到过的东西，就像那块玻璃镇纸和查林顿先生记了一半的押韵诗，属于已经消失的、浪漫的过去——那是他自己心里对旧时代的叫法。不知为何，他总以为葡萄酒像黑莓酱一样，味道很甜，而且很快就能让人有醉意。实际上，他终于喝到时，那种东西显然令人失望。原因在于喝了许多年的杜松子酒后，他变得几乎不会品酒。他放下空玻璃杯。

“这么说是有戈斯坦因这个人了？”他问道。

“对，有这么一个人，而且还活着。至于在哪儿，我也不知道。”

“那么串联活动还有组织呢？是不是真的有？不会纯粹是思想警察无中生有编出来的吧？”

“不，是真的，我们叫它兄弟会。除了它存在以及你属于其中一员，别的你什么都不会知道，我很快就会再谈到这点。”他看了看他的手表。“即使是内党党员，关掉电屏超过半小时也是不明智的。你们不应该一起来，必须分别离开。您，同志——”他向茱莉娅点了点头。“您先走。我们还有二十分钟左右。你们要明白我必须问一些问题。总的说来，你们准备做什么？”

“做任何我们力所能及的事。”温斯顿说。

奥布兰在椅子里把身子转过一点，好正对着温斯顿。他几乎对茱莉娅视而不见，似乎想当然认为温斯顿能代表她说话。他眼闭一会儿，然后开始以低沉而无感情的声音提问，好像是例行公事，是种问答教学法，多数问题的答案他已经心里有数。

“你们愿意牺牲自己的生命吗？”

“愿意。”

“你们愿意杀人吗？”

“愿意。”

“去干可能导致几百个无辜百姓丧命的破坏活动呢？”

“愿意。”

“去向外国出卖你的国家呢？”

“愿意。”

“你们愿意去欺骗，造假，勒索，腐蚀儿童的思想，散发让人上瘾的药品，教唆卖淫，传播性病——做任何可能导致道德败坏以及削弱党的力量的事？”

“愿意。”

“比如说，如果向小孩脸上泼硫酸这件事在某种意义上说对你们有利——你们也愿意去做吗？”

“愿意。”

“你们愿意隐姓埋名，余生都当一个服务员或码头工人吗？”

“愿意。”

“如果我们命令你们自杀，你们也愿意吗？”

“愿意。”

“你们愿意——你们两个人——永远分开不再见面吗？”

“不！”茱莉娅突然插了一句。

而温斯顿觉得自己好像过了很久才回答。有那么一阵子，他甚至好像无力说话。他的舌头在无声地动着，先是想发出某个词的音节，接着又想发另外一个词的开头音节，他不知道说什么好。“不。”他最后说。

“你们能告诉我，很好，”奥布兰说，“我们有必要了解一切。”

他转过身面对茱莉娅又说起话来，语气里多了点感情。

“您明不明白就算他不死，他也可能变成另外一个不同的人？我们可能不得不给他一个新身份。他的脸、动作、手形、头发颜色——甚至声音都会不一样了，而且有可能您自己也会变成另外一个人。我们的外科医生能把一个人改头换面得认不出来，有时候这也是必要的，有时候我们甚至截去他的一只手或脚。”

温斯顿忍不住又很快瞟了一眼马丁那张蒙古人种的脸庞，上面看不到有什么疤痕。茱莉娅的脸略微变得苍白了一些，让她的雀斑显现出来，但她仍然大胆地看着奥布兰。她咕哝了一句什么话，似乎是表示同意。

“好，这就好了。”

桌子上有个装香烟的银盒，奥布兰很是心不在焉地把烟推给温斯顿他们抽，自己也抽了一根，接着他站起身，开始慢慢踱来踱去，似乎他站着可以更好地思考。那是种高级香烟，很粗，卷得很好，卷烟纸也有种不寻常的柔滑感。奥布兰又看了看手表。

“马丁，你最好去餐具室，”他说，“再过一刻钟我就要再打开电屏了。你走的时候，好好认认这两位同志的脸，你会再见到他们，我可能不会。”

跟刚才在大门时一样，矮个男人的黑眼睛扫视他们的脸庞。他的举止里丝毫没有友好的样子，他在记下他们的外貌，然而对他们不感兴趣，要么是看不出他感兴趣，温斯顿想到假面可能无法改变表情。马丁没说话，没做出任何打招呼的动作就出去了，走时无声地关上了门。奥布兰在踱来踱去，一只手放在黑色工作服的口袋里，另一只手夹着香烟。

“你们要明白，”他说，“你们将在黑暗里斗争，永远会是在黑暗里。你们会收到命令，然后服从命令，也不会明白是为什么。回头我送给你们一本书，从这本书里，你们会了解到我们在其中生活的这个社会的真正本质，还有我们据以摧毁它的策略。读完这本书，你们就是兄弟会的正式成员了。但是除了我们为之奋斗的总目标以及当前任务，你们对兄弟永远了解不到什么。我告诉你们它存在，但是我告诉不了你们它的成员有一百个呢，还是一千万。以你们的个人经历来说，你们永远连十几个兄弟会成员的名字也说不上来。你们会有三四个联系人，他们经常消失，然后由别人接上。因为这是你们的初次联系，所以会保持下去。你们收到命令时，会由我发出。如果我们觉得有必要跟你们联系，就会通过马丁。最终被抓到后，你们会坦白，那不可避免，但是除了自己的行为，你们能坦白的很少。你们坦白出来的，不过是少数几个不重要的人。很可能你们甚至无法出卖我，到那时，我要么已经死了，要么成了另外一个人，长着另外一副面孔。”

他又在柔软的地毯上走来走去。虽然他很魁梧，举动中却仍具有非凡的优雅之处。即使在他把手伸在口袋里，或者把弄那根香烟时，仍能散发出优雅气质。他给人一种印象他不仅有力量，而且自信和善解人意，尽管带有嘲讽意味。不管他内心可能有多么热切，他一点也没有狂热分子那种执着的样子。说起谋杀、自杀、性病、截肢和易容时，他隐约有种开玩笑的样子。“这不可避免，”他的话音似乎这样表示，“这是我们一定要做的，不能退缩。然而如果生命再次变得值得活下去，我们就不会做这件事。”温斯顿的心里油然而生对奥布兰的钦佩之情，那几乎是崇拜。他暂时忘了戈斯坦因幽灵般的形象。看着奥布兰结实的肩膀和坚毅的脸庞时——非常丑陋而又非常文雅——不能不相信他不可击败。他精通谋略，能预见到所有危险。连茱莉娅也似乎被他打动了。她由着她那根烟自行燃尽，在聚精会神听着。奥布兰继续说道：

“你们已经听到过有关兄弟会存在的传言，无疑你们也已经形成了自己的看法。以你们的想象，兄弟会进行规模巨大的地下串联活动，在地下室秘密聚会，在墙上涂写东西，通过暗号或者特殊手势互相接头等，然而这种事情一样也不存在。兄弟会的成员无法互相确认，对任何一个成员来说，除了很少几个人，不可能知道更多成员。即使戈斯坦因落到思想警察手里，他也招不出一份成员名单，也招不出什么资料让他们能顺藤摸瓜得到全体成员名单，根本不存在这样的名单。兄弟会无法完全被消灭，因为它不是一般意义上的组织，它之所以存在，靠的是一种信念，那不可摧毁。除了这种信念，你们永远不会有别的来支撑自己。你们感受不到同志之情，也没人来鼓励你。最终被逮捕后，你们不会得到任何帮助。我们从来不对成员进行营救，最多是在绝对需要让某个人不能开口时，有时把一个剃须刀片夹带送进牢房。你们必须适应没有结果也没有希望的生活。你们会工作一段时间，然后会被逮捕，你们会坦白，后来就会被处死。这些是你们将看到的仅有的结果，任何可见的变化在我们这辈子里都不可能看到。我们是死了的人，我们真正的生命在于未来。我们会仅仅以几捧尘土、几块骨头参与到未来，然而未来有多远不得而知，可能在一千年后。目前，除了一点点扩大具有理智思想的人群，别的都不可能。我们不能合力行动，只能通过一个人向另一个人、一代向下一代这种方式来向外传播我们的认识。在思想警察当道时，你别无选择。”

奥布兰停了下来，第三次看他的手表。

“差不多到您该走的时间了，同志。”他对茱莉娅说，“等等，瓶里还有一半呢。”

他把杯子全倒满，然后手持杯柄举起他那杯。

“这次是为什么而干杯呢？”他仍然带着一丝讥讽的样子说，“为了思想警察不辨东西？为了老大哥死掉？为了人性？为了未来？”

“为了过去。”温斯顿说。

“过去最重要。”奥布兰严肃地表示同意。他们喝完了杯子里的酒，然后过了一会儿，茱莉娅起身要走。奥布兰从橱柜顶上取下一个小盒子，递给她一片扁平的白色药片，要她放在舌头上。他说在出去时别冒酒气，这点很重要，因为开电梯的是个善于观察的人。她出去后门一关上，奥布兰就似乎已经忘了她的存在。他又来回踱了几步，然后停了下来。

“还有些细节问题，”他说，“我估什你们有个藏身地方？”

温斯顿给他说了查林顿先生楼上那个房间。

“那里暂时可以用，以后我给你们另外安排一个地方，重要的是经常变换藏身地方。另外，我要把‘那本书’送给您。”温斯顿注意到就连奥布兰说起那个词时，好像也是带了引号。“您也明白，就是戈斯坦因的书，可能要过几天我才能拿到一本。您可以想象到，它没有几本在世，思想警察对它的查抄和销毁跟我们印刷它的速度一样快，但那几乎无关紧要，这本书不可毁灭。上一本没有了，我们可以几乎一字不错地再印一本。您上班带不带公文包？”

“肯定带。”

“什么样的？”

“黑色，很破旧，有两根系带。”

“黑色，两根系带，很破旧——好。近期的某一天——我不能肯定是哪天——您上午上班时收到的通知中，有个词是印错的，您必须要求重发这个通知。第二天，您上班时别带公文包。那一天某个时候，有人会碰碰脸的胳膊说：‘我想您的公文包掉了。’在他给您的公文包里，有本戈斯坦因的书。您要在两周内归还。”

他们有一阵没说话。

“还有几分钟您就得走了，”奥布兰说，“我们会再次见面——如果我们真能再次见面——”

温斯顿抬头看着他。“在没有黑暗的地方？”他迟疑地说。

奥布兰点了点头，没有显得惊讶。“在没有黑暗的地方。”他说，似乎也想起了这句话的出处。“还有，在您走之前，还有什么想说的话？有没有什么口信？什么问题要问？”

温斯顿想了一下，好像也没什么问题想问了，更没有想泛泛而言地唱高调。他想到的不是直接跟奥布兰或者兄弟会有关的任何事情，他脑子里出现的，是混合在一起的图象，包括他跟母亲度过最后一段时间的阴暗房间，查林顿先生铺子上面的房间，那块玻璃镇纸还有带玫瑰木画框的钢雕版版画。他几乎是随随便便地问：

“您会不会刚好知道一首老押韵诗，开头是‘“桔子和柠檬。”圣克莱门特教堂的大钟说’？”

奥布兰又点了点头，他严肃而有彬彬有礼地说完了诗中那一节：



“桔子和柠檬。”圣克莱门特的大钟说。

“你欠我三个法寻。”圣马丁教堂的大钟说。

“你什么时候还我？”老百利的大钟说。

“等我富了再说。”肖尔迪奇教堂的大钟说。



“您知道最后一行！”温斯顿说。

“对，我知道最后一行。现在您恐怕该走了，到时间了，可是等一下，最好让我给您取片药。”

温斯顿站起身，奥布兰伸出一只手，他握手有力得要把温斯顿的手给捏碎。到门口时，温斯顿转过头，奥布兰却似乎正在把他从心里忘掉。他在等待，手放在控制电屏的开关上。在他身后，温斯顿能看到写字台、绿色灯罩的电灯、口述记录器和放着厚厚文件的铁丝篮。这件事情已经结束。他想到半分钟后，奥布兰又会重新为党做起中断的重要工作。





第九章


温斯顿疲劳得像凝胶一样。凝胶是个恰当的用词，自动出现在他脑海里。他的身体似乎不仅像果冻那样软，而且也呈半透明状。他觉得如果把手举起，会看到光线透过来。全部血液和淋巴液都因为无比繁重的工作而被抽干，只留下由神经、骨骼和皮肤组成的脆架子。所有知觉都似乎被放大，工作服在磨擦他的肩膀，人行道让他的脚底发痒，甚至把手张开攥住都是种费力的动作，能让他的关节咯咯作响。

他在五天内的工作时间超过九十个小时，部里其他所有人也是。现在全结束了，直到明天上午，他实际上无事可做，没有任何党安排的工作要做。他可以去那个藏身处过上六小时，然后再在自己的床上睡九小时。在不算炎热的下午阳光中，他慢腾腾地走上一条通向查林顿先生的铺子的肮脏街道，同时也注意看有没有巡逻队出现，然而他感情用事地相信这天下午不可能有谁来干涉他。他带的公文包重得每走一步都碰到他的膝盖，让他的腿部皮肤从上到下都有发麻的感觉，里面装的就是“那本书”，他带着它已有六天，但是还没有打开过，甚至没看过一眼是什么样子。

仇恨周的第六天，在经过游行、讲话、呼喊、歌唱、旗帜、宣传画、电影、蜡像、军鼓滚奏和小号尖响、操正步的踏地声、坦车履带的轧轧声、大批飞机的轰鸣、枪炮齐响——这样过了六天之后，最高潮颤动着接近顶点，对欧亚国的全面仇恨沸腾着达到狂乱的程度。将在仇恨周的最后一天被公开处以绞刑的二千个欧亚国战争犯如果落到人们手里，无疑会被撕成碎片。但就在这时，却宣布大洋国根本不是在跟欧亚国，而是在跟东亚国打仗，欧亚国是盟国。

当然，无人承认有过任何转变，只是极其突然地，每个人都知道了敌国是东亚国而不是欧亚国。大家知道的那一刻，温斯顿正在参加一次示威活动，在伦敦的中心广场举行。时当夜晚，那些白色的面孔及鲜红的旗帜被耀眼的泛光灯照射着。广场上集中了数千人，其中包括一千个身穿侦察队制服的小学生组成的方阵。在用红布装饰的讲台上，某个内党的演讲家正向人群做着慷慨激昂的讲话。他是个瘦削的矮个男人，长着跟身材不相称的长手臂和一颗硕大的秃顶头，上面还有几络稀疏的头发。他长得像个侏儒，因为仇恨而扭动着身子，一只手抓着话筒柄，另一只手——胳膊瘦骨嶙峋，手却大如蒲扇——在头顶的空气中凶狠地抓舞。他的声音因为扩音器而带上了金属味，在没完没了地迸射着一系列内容，诸如暴行、屠杀、驱逐、抢劫、强奸、拷打战俘、轰炸平民、散布谎言的宣传、侵略、背信毁约等。听他演讲，你不可能不先是相信，然后变得疯狂。每隔一阵子，人群的愤怒沸腾起来，喇叭的声音被野兽般的咆哮声压了下去，那是从几千个喉咙不可遏制地爆发出来的，而最为野性十足的喊叫，来自那些学童。讲话持续了可能有二十分钟时，一个通讯员匆匆走上讲台，把一张纸条塞到演讲家手里。他打开看了一眼，然而并未停止演讲。他的声音和行为都没有任何改变，他演讲的内容也未改变，但是突然间，那些名字变了。不用说什么话，理解像波浪一样掠过人群。大洋国在跟东亚国打仗！然后出现一阵剧烈的骚动。广场上布置的旗帜和宣传画全错了！超过一半的宣传画上印错了面孔。这是蓄意破坏！戈斯坦因的特务在行动！接着出现了暴乱般的一段插曲，宣传画被人们从墙上扯下来，旗帜被撕成碎片踩到脚底。侦察队的队员表现出了惊人敏捷的身手，他们爬上楼顶，把烟囱那里飘扬的三角旗剪掉。才两三分钟时间，这些工作就全部完成了。那位演讲家仍紧攥话筒柄，肩部前倾，另一只空出来的手在空中抓舞，仍然在演讲。再过一分钟，人群中又爆发出愤怒而引起的野蛮咆哮声。仇恨周跟刚才一样，丝毫不走样地进行，只是仇恨的对象变了。

温斯顿回头想一想时，令他印象深刻的是，那个演讲者实际上是在某句话中间变了调，不仅没打顿，而且甚至没破坏句子结构。但在那时，他还在想着另外一件事。宣传画被扯掉的混乱时刻，有个他没看到其长相的男人拍拍他肩膀说：“对不起，我想您的公文包掉了。”他没说话，心不在焉地接过公文包。他知道还要再过几天，他才有机会看看里面的东西。示威活动结束后，他立即回到了真理部，尽管那时已经差不多二十三点，部里全体工作人员都是这样做的。电屏里已经传出要他们回到工作岗位上的命令，但那几乎是多此一举。

大洋国在跟东亚国打仗，大洋国一直在跟东亚国打仗。过去五年内的政治性文献的绝大部分都已完全落伍，所有报道和档案、报纸、书籍、小册子、电影、录音、照片等——一切都必须以闪电般的速度改掉。虽然没有什么指示，但大家都明白，部里的首长希望在一星期内，让所有地方都不再提到跟欧亚国打仗、与大洋国结盟之事。这项工作极其艰巨，而且由于不得明言涉及到的做法而更显艰巨。档案司里的每个人都是每天工作十八个小时，小睡两次，每次三个小时。从地窑里取出了床垫，走廊上全摊的是。三餐饭由食堂服务员用推车推着到处发放，包括三明治和胜利咖啡。每次温斯顿暂停工作去睡会儿觉时，总是努力把桌子上的活干完；而每次当他眼皮沉重、腰酸背痛地拖着脚步回来后，他的桌子上又堆满积雪一样的纸卷，不仅把口述记录器埋了一半，而且多得掉到了地上，因此他要做的第一件事，总是把纸卷堆成够整齐的一堆，好给自己腾出地方干活。最难办的，是这项工作根本不是完全机械性的，一般情况下用一个名字代替另一个就行了，然而凡是处理某些事件的详细报道时，都需要细心再加上想象力，甚至在把某场战争搬到世界上另外一个地方时，都需要相当丰富的地理知识才行。

到了第三天，他的眼睛疼得难以忍受，眼镜片每隔几分钟就需要擦一次。这就像在撑着干一件极其累人的体力活，一件有权利拒绝去干，然而又神经质地渴望将其完成的活。他低声向口述记录器念出的每个词、蘸水笔的每一划都是精心编造的谎言，然而在有时间回想一下时，他不记得自己被这一事实困扰过。跟档案司里别的人一样，他渴望能把这种伪造工作干得十全十美。第六天上午，纸卷来量少了下来。长达半小时里，什么也没有从管子里吹送出来，然后又是一个纸卷，接着又没有了。差不多在同一时间，每个地方的工作都轻松了。记录司里的每个人都悄悄长叹一口气，一件不可提及的伟大功绩完成了。现在对任何人来说，都无法以文件证据证明跟欧亚国发生过战争。十二点时，出人意料地收到通知，说部里所有工作人员从下午到第二天上午都不用上班。温斯顿仍带着装有“那本书”的公文包——工作时放在两腿之间，睡觉时放在身子下面——回了家，刮过脸后，他几乎在浴缸里就睡着了，虽然水才微温而已。

他爬上查林顿先生铺子里的楼梯，关节有点叫人舒服地咯咯作响。他身上累，却不再困乏。他打开窗户，点亮肮脏的小油炉，在上面放了一锅水准备煮咖啡。茱莉娅很快也会来，还有“那本书”也在这里。他坐在那张脏乎乎的扶手椅上，解开了公文包的系带。

这是本黑面厚书，装订较差，封面上没印作者名字或书名，印刷字体也略微有点不一致。页边已经破旧不堪，很容易就会散页，似乎这本书已经过很多人手。有书名的那一页上印着：





寡头集体主义的理论与实践


伊曼纽尔·戈斯坦因　著



温斯顿开始阅读：





第一章

无知即力量


有史以来，很可能自新石器时代结束以来，世界上一直存在三种人：上等、中等和下等。他们以很多方式再往下细分，有过无数不同的名称，他们的相对数量以及相互态度都因时代而异，然而社会的基本结构却从未改变。即使经过翻天覆地和似乎不可逆转的变化之后，同样的格局总是重新得以奠定，就像无论往哪个方向推得再远，陀螺仪都会恢复平衡一样。

这三个阶层的目标永远不可调和……



温斯顿停了下来，主要是为了体会一下他正在舒适安全地读书这一事实。他独自一人，没有电屏，锁眼上也无人偷听，没有扭头扫视或手捂住书本这种不安的冲动。宜人的夏日微风吹拂他的脸颊，从远方某处，隐隐约约传来小孩子的叫喊声，在这个房间里，除了时钟虫鸣般的走时声，没有别的声音。他往扶手椅里坐得更深一些，把脚放在壁炉前的挡板上。这是种无上的幸福，是不变的永恒。突然，正如一个人有时会翻一本他知道最终会把每个词都一读再读的书本那样，他把书翻到另外一处，发现已经是第三章。他继续阅读：





第三章

战争即和平


二十世纪中期以前，即可预见到世界将分成三个超级大国。由于俄国吞并了欧洲，大英帝国被美国吞并，现存三大国中，有两个在当时已实际存在，第三个大国东亚国将在又经过十年混战后崛起。三者之间的边界在某些地区很明确，而在另外一些地区，随着战争形势发展而波动，但一般而言是按照地理界线。欧亚国包括整个欧亚大陆北部，从葡萄牙到白令海峡；大洋国包括美洲、大西洋岛屿以及不列颠各岛、澳大利亚和非洲南端；东亚国比另外两国小一些，西部边界不是很确定，它包括中国及其以南地区、日本群岛以及蒙古面积不定的大片区域。

要么联甲攻乙，要么联乙攻甲，三个超级大国永远处于交战中，过去二十五年里一直如此。然而战争也不再像二十世纪前几十年的战争那样，具有孤注一掷、你死我活的性质。它是各个无法击溃对方的参战国之间目标有限的战事，既无具体开战原因，也无意识形态方面的真正差异。但这并不是说战争方式或者在战争问题上的盛行态度变得没那么嗜血或者多了点骑士精神，恰恰相反，战争歇斯底里症在各国内部都经久不衰并普遍存在，像强奸、劫掠、屠杀儿童、把大批人口变成奴隶，甚至发展到煮死及活埋这样针对战俘的报复行为都被视为正常，而且如果是己方而不是敌方所为，此种行为就更值得称颂。然而从实际意义上说，战争涉及的人数很少，其中多数都是受到高度训练的专家，造成的伤亡数字相对少一些。战斗都是在一些不清不楚的边境地区，一般人都知之不详，要么在扼据海路战略地点位置的水上堡垒附近。从各国社会和生活方式意义上说，战争的意义仅限于消费品的长年短缺和偶尔打来一颗火箭弹炸死几十个人而已。事实上，战争的特点已经改变。说得更准确点，发动战争的理由在重要性顺序上已经改变。在二十世纪上半叶的大战中只占较小程度的动机现在已成为主导性的，被有意识认可并依照其行动。

为理解如今的战争——因为战争或结盟的对象每隔几年总会变化，但总是同样的战争——人们必须首先理解战争不可能是决定性的，三者的任何一个都不可能完全被征服，甚至另外两国联合起来也做不到，它们过于势均力敌，而且相互之间的天然屏障太难克服。欧亚国被其辽阔疆域所保护，大洋国依靠大西洋和太平洋的宽度，东亚国靠的是其居民善于生养以及勤劳的本性。第二，从实际意义上说，也没可以打仗的原因了。随着自给自足经济体制的形成，生产和消费达到平衡，在以前的战争中，作为主要战争理由的争夺市场这点已不复存在，原材料之争也不再是你死我活的问题。不管怎样，三个超级大国辽阔得能够在各自疆域内取得所需全部物资。如果说战争还有直接经济原因，那就是对劳动力的争夺。各大国的国境之间，存在一个哪个国家都不曾长期占领的地带，大致呈四边形，四个角中包括丹吉尔、布拉柴维尔、达尔文港，(1)它包括了全球五分之一的人口。三大国就是为了占领这一带人口密集的地区和北部的冰盖区而争斗不已。实际上三者中，谁都不曾占领过全部争议地区，它的各部分经常易手，要靠突然的背信弃义行为，才能占据这一块或那一块地方，正是这一点，造成了结盟方式的不断变化。

所有被争夺的地区都蕴藏着宝贵的矿产资源，有些地方出产重要的植物产品，如橡胶，在较寒冷地方生产橡胶，则需要以费用相对较高的合成方法。然而最重要的，是这些地区拥有永不枯竭的廉价劳动力储备。不管哪个国家，只要占领了赤道非洲或者中东地区，或者印度南部，或者印度尼西亚群岛，就同时能够支配几千万乃至几亿廉价而勤劳的苦力。这些地区的居民多少被公开置于被奴役的地位，永远是前一个征服者刚走，下一个又来，而且被当做煤和石油一样的消耗品，以竞赛制造更多军备，攫取更多领土，控制更多劳动力，制造更多军备，攫取更多领土，就这样无限进行下去。应该看到的是，战斗从未越过被争夺地区的边界。欧亚国的国境在刚果河和地中海北岸之间波动，印度洋和太平洋的岛屿在大洋国和东亚国之间不停易手，在蒙古，欧亚国和东亚国的分界线从未稳定过；在北极地区，三者都声称对极其辽阔的疆域拥有主权，其实那里大部分地区都荒无人烟，也未经探测。力量平衡却总是被大体维持着，作为三大国的中心地域从未被侵犯过。此外，赤道地区被剥削人民的劳动对全球经济而言，也并非真正必需，他们对全球财富总量没有一点贡献，因为不管他们生产的是什么，总被用于战争这个目的，发动战争的目的，总是为了让己方国家在发动下次战争时处于有利地位。通过被奴役人民的劳动，永不停息的战争的速度会加快。然而即使他们不存在，全球社会结构以及这种结构自我维持的过程也不会有根本不同。

现代战争最重要的目标（根据双重思想原则，这一目标被内党的头头脑脑承认的同时也否认）是消耗机器的产品而不提高总体生活水准。从十九世纪末期开始，如何处理剩余消费品的问题就成为工业社会的潜在问题。当前，少数人就算能填饱肚子，这个问题显然仍不紧迫，即使不进行人为销毁，也可能不会成为紧迫问题。当今世界跟一九一四年以前的世界比较起来，是个物质缺乏、食不裹腹、满目疮痍的世界，跟当时人们所设想的未来世界比起来更是如此。二十世纪初期，设想中的未来社会是个令人难以置信的富足安逸、井井有条、效率极高的社会——是个由钢铁和雪白水泥所构建的光彩夺目、一尘不染的世界——那是几乎每个识字的人们意识中的一部分。科学技术以惊人速度发展，而且很自然可以想象科技会永远发展下去。但这些并未发生，部分由于长期战争和革命所造成的穷困，部分由于科技进步需要思想上的经验主义习惯，在一个严格军事化管理的社会里，这种习惯无法幸存。总体而言，当今世界比五十年前的世界更原始。有些落后地区得到发展，不少东西被发明出来，但总是以某种方式跟战争和警方的侦察活动有关，实验和发明总体上说是停止了，二十世纪五十年代的核战争所造成的破坏从未被全面修复过。然而，机器的潜在危险性总是存在。机器首次出现时，在所有能够思考的人们看来，人们无必要再从事苦工，因此人与人之间的不平等现象很大程度上也将消失。如果机器是有意为此目标而使用，那么几代人以后，饥饿、过劳、肮脏、文盲和疾病就会被消除。实际上机器并非有意为此目标使用，而是按照一种自动的过程。在十九世纪末到二十年代初差不多五十年时间里，机器确实大大提高了普通人的生活水平，这是通过生产出有时不可能不分配的财富来完成的。

然而同样明显的是，财富的全面增长具有毁灭性危险——确实如此，从某种意义上说，是要毁灭等级社会。如果这个世界上每个人都只需要工作很短的时间、能够填饱肚子、能够住在一幢有厕所、有冰箱的房屋里，而且拥有一辆汽车甚或飞机，最明显和也许是最重要的不平等将不复存在。如果这成为全面现象，那么财富就不会带来差别。无疑可以想象有这么一个社会，私人财产和奢侈品意义上的财富是平均分配的，而权力仍然把持在享受特权的少数人手里，但事实上，这种社会不可能保持长期稳定。如果所有人都能享受悠闲自在、高枕无忧的生活，绝大多数人都将学会识文断字和独立思考，而一般情况下，他们可能因为贫穷而变得愚昧。他们学会这些后，早晚会意识到享受特权的少数人是尸位素餐者，就会将之扫除。长远而言，等级社会只有建立在贫穷和无知的基础上，才有可能存在。回到农业社会——正如二十世纪初某些思想家梦想过的那样——实际上不可行，它跟机械化趋势相矛盾，而机械化在全球范围内，已经差不多类似一种本能。再者，任何国家如果一直保持工业落后状态，那么在军事上都会过于软弱，肯定会直接或间接受制于更先进的对手国家。

通过控制物品产量来让广大人民保持贫穷状态，也不是令人满意的解决办法。在资本主义的最后阶段，约在一九二零年到一九四零年之间，很大程度上采用的就是这种办法。许多国家的经济因此一直处于停滞状态，土地抛荒，不再增添资本设备，很大一部分人没有工作，靠政府救济才得以苟延残喘。然而也会导致军事上的弱势，因为它造成的贫困显然并非必需，使得反抗不可避免。问题是怎样让工业的车轮继续转动，而又不增加世界上的财富。必须生产出货物来，却又必须不去将之分配。实践中，只能通过不断的战争才能达到这一目标。

战争最根本的行为是毁灭，不一定是人命，而是人们的劳动产品。战争是个将物资粉碎或者抛到同温层，或者沉到海底的办法，否则这些物资就会让人们生活得过于舒适，因而从长远意义上说，会过于聪明。即使战争武器真的被摧毁了，武器生产仍是消耗劳动力的方便途径，而不用去生产任何可供消费的东西。例如，建造一个水上堡垒所使用的劳动力就能建造出一百艘货船，然而这一堡垒最终也会报废拆掉，永远不能为任何人带来物质上的好处，接着再花费极巨的劳动力去建造下一座水上堡垒。从原则上说，战争努力总是计划得能够消耗掉满足人们最低需求之外的所有剩余物。实际上，人们的需求总是被低估，结果是生活必需品中有一半总处于短缺状况，然而就连这点也被认为是有利条件。这是精心制订的政策，让即使享有特权的团体也在困苦的边缘徘徊，因为普遍的物资缺乏能够增加小小特权的重要性，因此能够导致不同集团之间的差别更为明显。以二十世纪初的标准衡量，甚至一个内党党员所过的生活也是艰苦朴素、工作繁重的。然而，他的确拥有的一些奢侈条件——他住面积很大、配套设施齐备的公寓，穿质地更好的衣服，享用高级的食物、酒类和烟草，还有两三个仆人供他驱遣，有自己的汽车或直升飞机——让他和外党党员的生活有天渊之别，而外党党员和他们称为“普罗”的贫不聊生的大批群众相比，又享有类似的特权地位。社会气氛是那种相当于被围困的城市之内的气氛，贫富的差别可能就是有没有一块马肉可吃。同时，由于人们意识到处于战争中，因此是处于危险中，这使得将全部权力交给一个小小的阶层似乎是自不待言，是为了生存下去不得已而为之。

可以看出，战争不仅完成了必需的摧毁工作，而且完成得在心理上也能接受。从原则上说，通过建造庙宇和金字塔，挖个坑然后再填上，或者甚至是生产出大批货物然后放把火烧掉这些方式，也能很简单地把过剩的劳动力浪费掉，然而这些方法仅能提供等级社会的经济基础，而非感情基础。在此，要关注的不是群众的精神面貌——只要让他们一直处于工作中，他们的态度便无关紧要——而是党自身的精神面貌。甚至是地位最低的党员也要求他们称职而且勤劳，甚至在有限的程度内头脑聪明，但是同样需要他们做易于轻信和愚昧无知的狂热分子，他们主要的精神状态是恐惧、仇恨、无限敬仰和欣喜如狂。换句话说，他应该具有和战争状态相适应的心理状态。战争是否真正发生着没有关系，而且因为不可能取得决定性胜利，战争进程的顺势逆势也没有关系，需要的只是应当保持战争状态。党要求其党员的智力分裂——这在战争气氛中更容易达到——现在几乎成了种普遍现象，而且所处职务越高，这一点就越突出。恰恰是在内党中，战争的歇斯底里症和对敌人的仇恨最强烈。以他作为管理者的身份，一个内党党员经常需要知道这条或那条战争消息是不实的，他也许经常也能意识到整个战争都是无中生有之事，既非正在发生着，也非为了跟所宣称的相去甚远的目的而发动，然而通过“双重思想”，不难使这种认识失效。同时，没有一个内党党员对战争正在进行着的神秘信念有过一丝动摇，而战争注定将以己方取胜而结束，大洋国将成为无可争议的世界主宰。

对这种即将到来的征服，所有内党党员都将其当做事关信仰之事。征服要么通过攫取一块块领土逐渐达到，从而积聚起无坚不摧的强大力量，要么靠着研制出无法与之对抗的新式武器。这种研制新式武器的工作正在持续不断进行，这也是具有创造力或者爱思考的头脑能得到用武之地的极少数活动之一。在当今大洋国，传统意义上的科学几乎已经不复存在。新话里没有“科学”这个词，过去的科学成就赖以建立的思维上的经验主义方法跟英社中最基本的原则相矛盾。就连技术进步，也必须是在它的产品能以某种方式用以减少人类自由的前提下才能取得。所有实用技术方面要么停滞不前，要么在倒退。耕作农田用的是马拉犁，书本却是用机器写就。但在至关重要的问题上——其实指的就是战争和警方的侦察活动——仍然鼓励用经验主义方法，要么至少这种方法得到容忍。党有两个目标，一是征服全世界，二是一劳永逸地消灭独立思考的可能性。因此，党要解决的最主要难题有两个，一是如何在并非本人自愿透露的情况下发现他正在想什么，二是在没有预警的情况下于几秒钟内消灭上亿人口。科学研究之所以仍继续进行，这些就是研究课题。现在的科学家要么是集心理学家和审讯者于一身，对脸部表情、动作和说话音调所蕴含的意义进行极其细致的研究，而且对让人说实话的药物、休克疗法、催眠和拷打肉体的效果进行试验；要么他是个化学家或者物理学家，或者生物学家，只研究他专业上的特定分支，跟杀人有关。在和平部里的巨型试验室里和隐蔽在巴西森林里——或是在澳大利亚的沙漠中，或是南极洲的不为人知的岛屿上——的试验站里，一队队专家正在不知疲倦地工作着。有些专家只是在制订将来战争的后勤计划，有些专家在设计越来越大个的火箭弹、威力越来越大的炸药和防护性能越来越好的装甲；还有些专家在寻找更致命的毒气，或者可大批生产的可溶性毒药，以致能全部消灭地球上的植物或者能抵抗所有可用抗生素的病菌种类；另外有些专家在努力制造出可以在地底下前进的车辆，如同潜艇在水下那样，或者像帆船一样不需要基地的飞机；还有些专家的研究方向更是匪夷所思，例如通过架设于几千公里以外太空中的透镜聚焦太阳光，或者利用地心热量，人为制造地震和海啸。

但是所有这些项目离实现从来差得很远，三大国中，没有哪个能明显领先另两个。更值得注意的是，所有三者都已经拥有原子弹，那比他们目前任何一种研制工作有可能制造出来的武器的威力都更大。虽然党习惯性地将原子弹的发明归功于自己，然而原子弹早在二十世纪四十年代就已出现，差不多十年后开始大规模使用。当时，几百颗炸弹投在工业中心地区，主要在俄国的欧洲部分、西欧以及北美。其后果令三国的统治集团明白再多投几颗，就意味着有组织社会的末日，因而也是他们自己掌权的结束之日。因此，虽然正式的协定不曾存在过或者有迹象存在过，然而没有谁再扔原子弹。三大国全都只是继续制造原子弹并储备起来，等待决定性机会的到来，他们都相信那一天迟早会来。同时，战术在三四十年的时间里几乎被固定下来。直升飞机比以前使用得更频繁，轰炸机在很大程度上已被自动推进的炮弹所取代，易受攻击的可航战舰让路给了不会沉没的水上堡垒，然而在其他方面，几乎无任何进展。坦克、潜水艇、鱼雷、机关枪，甚至步枪和手榴弹都仍在使用。虽然报章上和电屏里在报道没完没了的杀戮，但是像早期战争中孤注一掷的战斗，也就是在几周内使几十万甚至是几百万人送命的战斗，却从未再次发生过。

三大国中没有一个会企图进行有可能带来重大失败危险的部队调动，所采取的任何大规模军事行动，都是对盟国的突然袭击。三者都采用的，或自欺地采用的都是同样策略。三者的计划是通过结合战斗、讨价还价和时机计算恰当的背叛行为，去占领多个基地，这些基地形成一个圆圈，将两个对手国家之一完全包围起来。然后跟该国签下友好条约，在许多年时间里与其保持和平关系，以致其疑心全失、麻痹大意起来。这段期间，装有核弹头的火箭弹可以集中到所有战略据点。到最后，这些火箭弹在同一时间发射，造成铺天盖地的效果，以至于不可能进行反击。然后再跟剩下的对手国家签订友好条约，并为下次攻击作准备。几乎不值一提的是，这种如意算盘只是白日做梦而已，没有实现的可能。不仅如此，除了赤道及北极附近的被争夺地区，从来没有哪个国家进攻过敌国领土，这就说明了各大国之间在某些地方有确定的边界。例如，欧亚国很容易就能攻占不列颠群岛，从地理位置上说，那是欧洲的一部分，另一方面，大洋国也能将其边界扩张到莱茵河甚至维斯图拉河(2)，但那样就违犯了各大国都遵循的关于文化统一性的不成文原则。如果大洋国占领以前被称为法国和德国的地区，就需要或者消灭掉当地的居民——会是一项实行起来极为困难的工作，或者把差不多有一亿的人口同化，从技术发展角度来说，这些人口与大洋国的人口处于一致的水平。三大国都面临同样难题，对其结构来说，绝对需要除了有限度地和战俘和黑人奴隶接触，不与外国人发生任何联系。甚至对目前的正式盟国，也以最复杂的猜忌之心度之。大洋国的普通公民除了见到战俘，从未见过一个欧亚国或者东亚国的公民，而且被禁止学习外语。如果他被允许跟外国人接触，就会发现他们跟他是同类，他被告知的关于那些人的说法绝大部分是谎言，他在其中生活的封闭世界将被打破，而他的道德观赖以存在的恐惧、仇恨和自以为是的正义感就可能灰飞烟灭。因此，所有三方都意识到不管波斯或者埃及，或者爪哇岛，或者锡兰易手多少次，除了炮弹，一切都绝对不可越过边界。

在此背后，有一项从未明明白白讲出来的事实，然而被默认，并成了行为准则，那就是所有三大国中的生活状况都相差无几。在大洋国盛行的哲学叫英社，在欧亚国盛行的哲学被称为新布尔什维主义，而在东亚国盛行的哲学有个中文名字，通常被译做“崇死”，但是也许“消灭自我”可以表达得更透彻一些。大洋国的公民被禁止了解另外两种哲学的任何宗旨，却被教导将其斥为野蛮地违背了道德和常识。实际上，这三种哲学几乎无法分别，所支持的社会体系根本无任何区别，都是同样的金字塔结构，同样有着对半人半神领袖的个人崇拜，经济同样由连绵战争所维持并为战争而服务。因此，三者不仅不能将对方征服，而且征服了也不会有何获益。恰恰相反，只要三者之间保持战争冲突，就会像三捆谷物那样互相支撑。通常而言，三者的统治集团对其所作所为在意识到的同时也意识不到。生活中，他们都致力于征服全世界，然而他们也知道，有必要让战争在不可能取胜的情况下永远继续下去。同时，因为不存在征服或者被征服的可能，使得否认现实成为可能，这也正是英社和与其对立的其他两种思想体系的特征。有必要重复一遍之前已经讲过的，也就是通过变得连绵不断，战争从根本上说，改变了自身性质。

在过去，一场战争几乎从定义上说，是早晚会结束的，通常说来，胜利还是失败也明确无误。在过去，战争也是人类社会与具体现实保持联系的主要手段之一。每个时代的每位统治者都曾试图将错误的世界观强加给他们的追随者，然而不会鼓励他们拥有趋于影响军事效率的错觉，其后果令这些统治者承受不起。只要失败意味着失去独立，或者意味着通常被认为不好的结果，就一定要认真防备以避免失败。具体事实不能视而不见。哲学或宗教或伦理学或政治中，二加二可能等于五，但在设计枪支或者飞机时，二加二就必须等于四。缺乏效率的国家总是迟早会被征服，而追求效率则不利于产生错觉。再者，为追求效率，就有必要向过去学习，那就意味着对过去发生之事要有相当精确的观念。当然，以前的报纸和历史书经常是带着偏见和经过歪曲的，但不可能像如今这样进行伪造活动。战争能可靠地让人保持理智，对统治集团而言，它也许是让理智得以保持的所有措施中最重要的。不管战争是赢是输，没有哪个统治集团完全毫无干系。

然而，当战争实际上变成连绵不断时，它也不再是危险的了。战争连绵不断时，就没有军事必要这一概念，技术进步可以停止，最明显的事实可以被否认或漠视。正如我们已经看到的，仍在进行的、能称为科学研究的研究仍是为了战争这一目标，然而从本质上说，那是种白日梦，而研究出不了成果也不重要。效率，甚至军事效率都不再需要。在大洋国，除了思想警察，一切都无效率。因为三大国的每一个都不可征服，实际上每个国家都是个自成一体的世界，在其中，几乎想怎样歪曲思想都可以放心实行。现实只是在日常生活需要中凸现出来——饮食需要，有房住，有衣穿的需要，避免服毒或者从顶楼窗户跳下来的需要，诸如此类。生与死、肉体的欢乐和疼痛之间仍有差别，但仅此而已。在被与外部世界以及过去切断联系的情况下，大洋国的公民就像位于星际之间的人，不知道哪个方向是上，哪个方向是下。这种国家里的统治者地位至高无上，就连以前的法老或恺撒都未曾达到。他们必须避免他们的追随者饿死太多，以免造成不便，不得不保持与对手国家在军事技术上保持同样的低水平。然而一旦达到这些起码条件，他们就可以将现实随心所欲地进行扭曲。

因此，按照从前的战争标准来衡量，现代战争不过徒有虚名而已，它就像某种反刍动物之间的争斗，这种动物头顶的角所长角度让它们不会互相伤害。但是尽管战争是虚假的，却并非没有意义。它会消耗掉剩余的消费品，也有助于保持那种特殊的精神氛围，那是等级社会所必需的。可以看出，现在的战争完全成了一种内部事务。过去，所有国家的统治集团虽然也承认他们的共同利益，因而对战争的破坏性进行控制，但他们的确互相开仗，而且胜利者也掠夺失败方。而在我们当今这个时代，他们根本没有互相开仗，战争是由统治集团向着自己的国民发动的，而且战争的目的，不是为了去攻占或防止被攻占领土，而是保持社会结构不变。因此，“战争”这个词就变得能使人误解。也许说得准确点，就是通过将其变成连绵不断的，战争已不复存在。从新石器时代一直到二十世纪早期的战争对人们造成的那种独特压力也不复存在，而代之以很不相同的其他之事。如果三大国不是互相开战，而是同意永远保持和平，每个国家的边界都不受侵犯，结果将完全一样。因为在那种情况下，每个国家都仍是自成一统的天地，永远不会有外来危险所带来的使人头脑清醒的影响。真正永远的和平和战争将是一回事。这一点——虽然党员中的绝大多数只是在浅层意义上明白这一点——就是党的标语“战争即和平”的内在含义。



温斯顿停止了阅读。远处，一颗火箭弹雷鸣般爆炸了。独自在没有电屏的房间里读禁书的极乐感觉仍未消逝。独处和安全是种身体上的感觉，不知为何，它跟身体上的疲累感、扶手椅的柔软感以及窗外吹入的微风拂在脸颊上的感觉掺杂在一起。那本书让他读得入迷，或者说得更准确一点，它给了他安心的感觉。从某种意义上说，那本书上所写的没有什么他不知道，但那正是它吸引人的部分原因。如果他有可能把自己的零乱思想整理出来，书上所说的正是他会说的东西。它是由另外一个跟他具有类似思想的人写出来的，但在能力、系统性和无畏精神方面，此人比他强了许多倍。在他看来，最好的书本是告诉你一些你已知事情的书本。他刚刚翻回第一章，就听到茱莉娅走上楼梯的声音，他从椅子上起身去迎接她。她把褐色工具包扔到地上，一下子扑进他怀里。他们超过一星期没见过面了。

“我拿到了‘那本书’。”松开她后温斯顿说。

“噢，你拿到了吗？好。”她没有多大兴趣地说，几乎马上就在油炉旁边跪下来开始煮咖啡。

直到在床上躺了有半小时后，他们才又回到这个话题。傍晚的凉意刚好可以让他们盖上床罩。楼下照常传来熟悉的唱歌声和靴子走在石板路上的摩擦声。温斯顿第一次来时看到的那个强壮的红胳膊女人几乎是院子里的固定景致，只要太阳不落山，她似乎没有一个钟头不是在洗衣盆和绳子之间走来走去，嘴里不是噙着晾衣服夹子，就是在兴致勃勃地唱歌。茱莉娅侧躺着，像是已经快睡着了。他伸手拿过在地板上放着的“那本书”，然后靠床头坐着。

“我们一定要读读它，”他说，“你也得读，所有兄弟会的成员都得读。”

“你读吧，”她眼也没睁地说，“读得大声点，这样最好了，你可以边读边解释给我听。”

时钟指向六点钟，即十八点，他们还有三四个小时。他把书本搁在膝盖上开始读了起来。





第一章

无知即力量


有史以来，很可能自新石器时代结束以来，世界上一直存在三种人：上等，中等和下等。他们以很多方式再往下细分，有过无数不同的名称，他们的相对数量以及相互态度都因时代而异，然而社会的基本结构却从未改变。即使经过翻天覆地和似乎不可逆转的变化之后，同样的格局总是重新得以奠定，就像无论往哪个方向推得再远，陀螺仪都会恢复平衡一样。



“茱莉娅，你醒着吗？”温斯顿问道。

“对，亲爱的，我听着呢。往下读，写得太棒了。”

他继续读下去：



这三个阶层的目标永远不可调和。上等阶层的目标是保持其地位，中等阶层的目标是跟上等阶层调换地位，下等阶层的目标，如果有——因为他们被苦工压得喘不过气，只是断断续续意识到他们日常生活之外的事情，这已经成为他们恒久的特点——就是要消灭所有差别，创造出一个人人公平的社会。因此具有相同主要特点的斗争贯穿了整部历史。很长一段时期内，上等阶层似乎牢牢掌握着权力，然而迟早会到了这么一个时候，他们要么对自己失去信心，要么无能力进行有效统治，要么两者皆有。接下来，他们被中等阶层推翻，中等阶层假装为了自由和正义而斗争，因而争取到了下等阶层的支持。但是中等阶层一旦达到目的，就立刻将下等阶层又强行置于原先受奴役的地位，然后自己成为上等阶层。很快，新的中等阶层从另外一种或两种人中分离出来，斗争又重新开始。三种人中间，只有下等阶层从未哪怕是暂时达到过目标。说自古至今从未有过实质上的进步是夸大其辞，即使在现在，虽然处于下降时期，一般人的生活水平跟几个世纪前的比起来还是有实质性提高。但是无论财富的增长、举止的文明化、改革或者革命，都不曾向着人类的平等推进过哪怕一毫米。从下等阶层的角度看来，历史性变动所意味的，除了主宰者的名称变化，从来别无其他。

到十九世纪后期，在许多观察者看来，此种模式的反复性显而易见，因此产生了一个思想家学派，他们将历史诠释为循环发展的，声称这一点表明了不平等乃人类生活的不变法则。当然，这一学说向来不乏拥护者，但在如今，它被提出的方式是大大不一样了。过去，等级社会这种社会形式的必要性特别被上等阶层宣扬，它被国王、贵族和靠其过着寄生生活的牧师、律师之类人鼓吹，一般说来，是通过承诺死后可以进入一个想象出来的世界，从而淡化等级社会的严峻性。中等阶层只要仍在为掌权而斗争，便总是使用自由、平等、博爱这些字眼。然而如今的情况是，四海之内皆兄弟的观念受到目前还没有、只是希望不久就会掌权的人们的攻击。过去，中等阶层打着平等的旗帜闹革命，然后当旧的专制一被推翻，就马上建立起新的专制，而新的中等阶层实际上事先就宣称要实行专制。社会主义作为一种理论，出现于十九世纪，是可以上溯到古代奴隶起义的一系列思想链条上的最后一环，它仍然深深受到旧时代乌托邦主义的影响。然而约从一九零零年以来出现的社会主义的每一变种都多少公开抛弃了建立自由、公平社会的目标。本世纪中叶出现的新运动——即大洋国的英社，欧亚国的新布尔什维主义，东亚国的通常被称为“崇死”的主义——都有自觉的目标，即保持不自由、不平等永远不变。这种新运动当然是从旧的发展而来，趋于变得有名无实，对旧的主义中的意识形态只是口头宣扬而已。然而这三种运动的目标都是抑制进步，在某个时刻让历史止步不前。那种常见的钟摆式运动将再次发生，然后就停下来。照例，上等阶层将被中等阶层推翻，后者就成了上等阶层，不过这一次，通过有意采取的策略，上等阶层将永远保持地位不变。

新学说之所以出现，部分是由于历史知识的积累和历史感的增强，那在十九世纪以前几乎不存在。历史的循环性前进如今已为人们所了解，要么说似乎如此。如果说它是可以理解的，那么就可以篡改。然而最重要也是最根本的原因，是早在二十世纪初，人类的平等已在技术上成为可能。仍然不变的是人们的天赋各不相同，能力也各不相同，有些人得天独厚，另一些人并非如此，然而到了二十世纪初，已经不再有阶级差别或者贫富悬殊的必要。在更早的时代，阶级差别不仅不可避免，而且有利。不平等是文明的代价。然而随着机器生产的发展，此种情形发生了变化。即使人们仍需要做不同种类的工作，却不再需要在不同的社会及经济水平上生活。因此，从正在夺取权力的新集团的角度看来，人类平等不再是个值得奋斗的目标，而是需要避开的危险。在更远古的时代，在实际上不可能存在平等公正的社会时，就会相当容易相信其存在。几千年以来，人们一直梦想有人间天堂，在其中，没有法律和累死累活的工作，人人亲如兄弟般在其中生活，甚至在确实从革命中获益的人们当中，这种憧憬也有一定市场。法国、英国和美国革命的继承者部分相信对于人权、言论自由、法律面前人人平等之类他们自己的说法，甚至其行为某种程度上也受到这些说法的影响。然而到了二十世纪四十年代，所有主要政治思想的主流都是独裁主义的了。恰恰就在有可能实现时，人们却不再相信有人间天堂。每一种新的政治理论，不管如何自称，都导致倒退回等级化和军事化。从一九三零年左右开始，在普遍正变得严峻的形势下，那些停止很久的做法，有些停止几百年了——不经审讯关押，把战俘当做奴隶使用，公开处决，刑讯逼供，扣押人质乃至放逐整个地区的人口——不仅变得平常，而且被自认开明和进步的人们容忍甚至辩护。

只是在全球范围内经过十年国际战争、内战、革命和反革命之后，英社和与其并立的其他主义才成为被全面贯彻执行的政治理论，其到来则早被其他许多体制预示过了，那些体制一般被称为极权主义，出现于本世纪早些时候，而将在大乱之后出现的新世界的轮廓则早就显而易见，由什么样的人来控制这个世界也同样显而易见。新生贵族绝大部分由官僚、科学家、技师、工会组织者、宣传专家、社会主义者、教师、记者和专业政治家所组成。这些人来源于领工资的中产阶级和工人阶级中的上层，由以垄断工业和中央集权政府所组成的贫瘠的世界造就，并团结到一起。跟旧时代相应阶层的人们比起来，他们没那么贪婪，更不易被奢侈生活所诱惑，更渴望拥有纯粹的权力，而最重要的是，他们对自己正在进行的行为有更清醒的认识，在镇压反抗方面更有决心，最后一个区别最重要。跟现今的专制比起来，过去的专制并非全力维持，而且缺乏效率。过去的统治集团某种程度上总受到开明思想的影响，对到处存在的控制不及的现象听之任之，只是关注明目张胆的行为，而且对他们的国民想什么毫不关心，甚至中世纪的教会以当今标准衡量，也具有宽容性。之所以如此的部分原因，是在过去，没有哪个政府能对其公民持续进行监视。然而印刷术的发明使得公众意见易于控制，而电影和收音机更在这方面推进一步。随着远程视像技术的开发，技术进步使得用同一台设备同时接受和传送变得可能，人们从此无法再过不受干涉的生活。在其他信息渠道都已断绝的情况下，任何公民，或者说至少每个重要到值得监视的公民都可能每天二十四小时处于警方监视之下，也二十四小时被置于官方的宣传声浪中。这样，不仅是完全服从于国家的意志，而且在所有问题看法上的绝对统一就史无前例地成为可能之事。

在五六十年代的革命之后，社会照例进行自我重组，分成上、中、下三个阶层。但是新的上等阶层跟以前的上等阶层不一样，他们并非依本能行事，而是知道怎样做才能保住地位。他们早就认识到寡头政治最稳固的基础是集体主义。财富和特权如果被集体拥有，捍卫起来也最为容易。二十世纪中叶进行的所谓“消灭私有财产”运动，其实意味着财富集中到了比以前少得多的人们的手里，不同之处是新的财富拥有者是个集团，而不是许多单独的人。从单独个人意义上说，党员除了很少的个人财产，别的什么都不拥有，但在集体意义上，党拥有大洋国的一切，因为它控制一切，并以其认为合适的方式处置产品。革命之后那些年里，它几乎未遭反抗就获得了这种主宰地位，这是因为整个过程都以集体化为代表。一般人总会设想，如果资本家被剥夺财产所有权，社会主义就肯定随之而来。毫无疑问资本家被剥夺了财产，工厂、矿山、土地、房屋、运输工具——他们被剥夺了一切。因为这些不再是私有财产，那就一定应该是公共财产。作为源于早期社会主义运动的英社，沿用了社会主义的措词，实际上也执行了社会主义纲领的主要部分，结果既是提前预见到，又是蓄意导向的，那就是经济上的不平等变成永久性的了。

然而为了长期保持等级社会，问题还要复杂得多。统治集团之所以下台，会有四种情形，要么被外部势力征服，要么其统治的效率不高，以致大众被发动起来造反，要么它让一个强大的、心怀不满的中等阶层得以出现，要么它丧失了统治的自信和意愿。这些因素都不是单一起作用的，作为规律，某种程度上说，这四种因素全都存在。统治集团如果能防止此四种因素出现，就会永远掌权。说到底，决定性因素还是统治集团自身的精神状态。

本世纪中叶之后，上述第一种危险在现实中已不复存在。如今将世界瓜分的三个国家中的每一个，实际上都不可征服，只有通过缓慢的人口变化使其有可能被征服，然而作为一个拥有广泛权力的政府，很容易就可以避免这样。第二种危险也只是种理论上的危险。大众从来不会自发造反，他们也从来不会仅仅因为受到压迫而造反。确实，只要不让他们掌握作比较的标准，他们就根本永远意识不到自己在受压迫。过去周期性发生的经济危机完全毫无必要，如今也不允许发生，但是其他情形，具有同样大范围的混乱状况能够而且确实会发生，只是不会带来政治性后果，因为不满不可能被表达得清晰有力。至于生产过剩的问题——因为机械技术的进步，在我们的社会，这一直是个潜在问题——可以通过连绵不断的战争解决（参见第三章），战争也有利于将大众的士气鼓舞到必要水平。因此，从我们目前的统治者的角度来说，唯一的真正危险，是从他们自身阶层分化出一个由能干、未尽其才、渴望权力的人所组成的集团，从而产生出自由主义和怀疑主义精神。这就是说，问题在教育，要不断促进领导集团和紧挨其下的更大的行政管理集团的觉悟，而大众的觉悟则要以否定其的方式来影响。

在此背景下，即使一个人原先不了解大洋国社会的主要结构，也能够推断出来。金字塔的顶端为老大哥，老大哥永远正确，无所不能。每次成功、每项成就、每次胜利、每项科学发现、所有知识、所有智慧、所有幸福、所有德行，都被认为是直接在他的领导和鼓舞下取得的。谁也不曾见过老大哥，他是宣传牌上的一张面孔，电屏里的一个声音。我们可以合理地确信他将万寿无疆，至于他何时出生，已经成了很不确定的事情。老大哥是党选择用来向世界展示自己的一个形象，他的作用是作为热爱、恐惧、崇拜的焦点，在对象是某个人而非某个机构时，这些感情更易于产生。老大哥之下是内党，人数限制在六百万，或者说不到大洋国人口的百分之二。内党之下是外党，如果内党可以称之为国家的大脑，外党就像国家的手。再往下是愚昧的大众，习惯上称之为“群众”，可能占全部人口百分之八十五。我们前面所做的社会分类中，群众是下等阶层，因为赤道地区的被奴役人口经常在征服者之间易手，不是永远或者必要的组成部分。

从原则上说，这三个集团的成员并非世代相传。内党党员的后代理论上并非生来就是内党党员，能否当上内党或外党党员，要在十六岁时通过考试决定。也不存在任何种族歧视或任何明显的一个地区控制另一个地区的现象。党的最高层有具有犹太人、黑人、南美人血统的党员，每个地区的行政管理者总是从那一地区的居民中挑选出来。大洋国的所有居民都没有自己被别人从一个遥远的首都殖民的感觉。大洋国无首都，其名义上的元首，是一个无人知其行踪的人。除了英语是通用语言，新话是官方语言，所有其他方面都未实行集中化。它的统治者不是靠血缘关系聚拢在一起，而是靠着信奉同样的教义。确实，我们的社会是分等级的，而且分得很严格，是按照乍一看似乎是世袭的脉络分等级。不同阶层之间发生的互相流动情况，比在资本主义甚至是工业前时代都要少得多。党的两个分支之间有一定数量人员换位，但目的只是把意志薄弱者从内党剔除出去，并提拔外党那些野心勃勃的人，以使其不致造成危害。群众实际上得不到提拔，其中最具天赋的，有可能成为传播不满的核心人物，他们只是被思想警察盯上并消灭掉。但此种状况并非一定永远不变，而且并非原则问题。党不是原先意义上的阶级，其目的不是将权力交给自己的下一代这样简单。如无其他办法让最能干的人留在最高层，它会完全准备好从群众阶层中简拔整整新的一代。关键年代里，党并非世袭体制这一点很大程度上能化解反抗。老式社会主义者被训练跟所谓的“阶级特权”作斗争，他们以为不是世袭的，便不会是永远的，然而他们不明白寡头政治的连贯性并不需要是在实际意义上，也未能想一想世袭贵族统治总是短命的，而像天主教会这样具有吸纳性的机构，有时会维持几百到几千年。寡头统治的要旨不是父传子、子传孙，而是坚持死者加诸生者的某种世界观和生活方式。只要它能指派自己的后继者，统治集团就永远会是统治集团。党所关心的不是血统上的永存，而是自身的不朽。只要等级化结构永远保持不变，至于是谁掌握权力并不重要。

真正说起来，所有我们这个时代特有的信仰、习惯、喜好、情感、精神状态，都是为了保持党的神秘性，并防止当前社会的本质被看透而有意使其持续下去。实际的造反行为或者任何造反的铺垫工作在目前都不可能。完全不用害怕群众，由其放任自流，他们就会一代接一代、一个世纪接一个世纪工作，生养，死去。他们不仅没有造反的冲动，而且不会明白世界可以变成另外一个样子。只有当工业技术的发展使得有必要对他们进行更高层次的教育时，他们才会变得危险，但是既然军事、商业以及竞争都不再重要，群众的教育水平实际上是降低了。群众有什么意见或者没有什么意见都被认为是无关紧要之事，他们之所以被允许享受思想的自由，是因为他们没有思想。另一方面，在党员身上，甚至在最不重要事项上最细微的思想越轨，也不能被容忍。

党员从出生到死亡都在思想警察的监视之下。即使独处时，他也永远不能确定他是否真的在独处。不管他在哪里，睡着还是醒着，工作还是休息，洗澡还是在床上，他都能在不经通知也不知觉的情况下被监视。他的一切行为都不是无关紧要。他的友情、娱乐、对妻子儿女的行为、独处时脸上的表情、睡梦时的咕哝讲话，甚至独具特点的身体动作，都被警惕地一点不漏监视着。不止是任何轻罪，而且是任何不管有多么不显眼的古怪行为、习惯上的改变、任何可能是内心斗争征兆的紧张姿态都注定会被发觉。在所有方面，他都不能随心所欲。另一方面，他的行为不是由法律或者任何清楚写明的行为规范所规定。大洋国没有法律，被查到就意味着肯定被处死的行为并未明示为严禁之列，持续不断的清洗、逮捕、拷打、监禁和蒸发这些惩罚手段并非针对实际所犯罪行而使用，而只是为消灭可能在未来某个时候犯下某种罪行的人而使用。对党员的要求是他不仅要有正确的思想，而且要有正确的本能。许多他被要求拥有的信念和态度从未被清楚地说明白，而要想说明白，就必然会将英社的内在矛盾之处赤裸裸揭示出来。如果他天生是个思想正统的人（新话称为“好想者”），他在所有情况下不用想就知道什么是正确信念或者应有情感。然而不管怎样，由于在他的儿童时期对他进行过围绕着“止罪”“黑白”、和“双重思想”这些新话词语的精心思想培训，他不愿意，也无力对任何方面想得太深入。

党员不应该有任何个人情感，而且内心要永远保持热情，他应该生活在仇恨国外敌人和国内叛徒的持续狂热状态中，因为打胜仗而欢欣鼓舞，在党的力量和智慧面前对自身产生渺小感。通过像两分钟仇恨会这种活动，他对贫乏的、无法得到满足的生活产生的不满被精心导向外部并消散，而有可能导致反抗态度的怀疑感被他很早就形成的内心纪律提前消除。这种纪律中首要的也是最简单的，甚至能教给小孩子的，就是新话里所谓的“止罪”。“止罪”意味着在即将产生任何危险思想的关头，具有马上停下的能力，如同本能。它包括掌握不了类推、看不到逻辑错误的能力，如果某个最简单的论点对英社不利，就对其进行误解的能力，还有对可能导致向异端思想发展的思绪感到厌烦或者抵制的能力。简而言之，“止罪”意味保护性的愚蠢，但光是愚蠢还不够，恰恰相反，在广义上，正统要求一个人像柔体杂技演员控制自己的身体那样，完全能控制自己的思路。大洋国社会从根本上守着这样的信条，即老大哥无所不能以及党永远正确，然而因为在现实中，老大哥并非无所不能，而党也并非永远正确，这就需要在现实问题上不懈地、时时刻刻地弹性对待。此处的关键词为“黑白”，跟新话里的许多词一样，这个词也有恰好相互矛盾的两种含义。用在敌人身上，它意味着无视客观事实、厚颜无耻地颠倒黑白的习惯。而用在党员身上时，它的意思是在党的纪律要求如此时，要出于忠诚的意愿去颠倒黑白。但它同时还意味着相信黑就是白这种能力，而且不止如此，知道黑就是白，然后忘记他曾相信黑就是黑，白就是白。这就要求一刻不停地篡改过去，这需要一种能够真正包容一切的思维体系，才有可能完成，在新话里，这被称为“双重思想”。

篡改过去有两个必要原因，一种是次要的，可以说，是预防性的。这个次要原因，就是党员之所以像群众一样忍受现状，部分原因是他没有可资比较的标准。一定要把他和过去切断，就像把他与外国切断一样，因为对于他，有必要相信他比他的祖先生活得更好，而且平均物质享受水准一直处于提高中。然而之所以需要对过去进行调整，重要得多的原因是要保证党的永远正确性。不止是讲话、统计数字和所有档案都必须不停被更新，以显出党在所有问题上预测都正确，也因为这样，才可以不承认所有教义以及政治联盟上的变化。因为改变自己的思想甚至是政策，都等于承认自己有缺点。例如，如果欧亚国或东亚国（不管哪一国）是当今的敌国，那么这个国家一定永远都是敌国。如果存在与此矛盾的其他事实，那些事实就必须被篡改，因此历史一直在被重写。这种每天都在伪造过去的工作由真理部进行，它跟由仁爱部进行的镇压及侦察行为对政权的稳固性都属必要。

过去的易变性是英社的基本教条之一。英社认为历史事件并非客观存在，而仅仅存在于文字档案以及人们的记忆里。档案和记忆在哪些方面一致，哪些就是过去。因为党全面控制档案，也全面控制党员的思想，因此过去就是党想让它什么样就是什么样。同时虽然过去可以被篡改，但它在任何特定事例上，却从未被篡改过。因为不管它在当时是需要按什么样子再创造，这一新版本就成了过去，没有任何不同形式的过去存在过。经常会这样，当同一事件在一年内被篡改好几遍，已经改得面目全非时，依然存在上述情况。永永远远，党掌握着绝对事实，而且很清楚，这种绝对事实永远都是现在的样子。可以看出，控制过去最重要的，取决于对记忆的训练。确认所有文字档案都跟目前的正统性相一致无非是种机械行为，然而也需要记住，事件是按照所希望的方式发生的。如果有必要重新安排记忆或者篡改文字档案，就有必要忘掉自己做过这种事。这样做的窍门，可以像其他任何一种思考方法那样学会，绝大多数党员的确都学会了，既聪明又正统的人更不用说全学会了。旧话中，它被很直白地称为“现实控制”。新话中，它被称为“双重思想”，不过还包括很多别的含义。

“双重思想”意味着在一个人的脑子里，同时拥有两种相互矛盾的信念，而且两种都接受。党的知识分子明白他的记忆必须往哪个方向改变，因此他知道自己在玩弄现实，然而通过实行“双重思想”，也能让他心安理得地认为现实不曾被改变。这个过程一定要有意识地进行，否则过程中精确度就不够，而且它也一定要无意识地进行，否则会带来一种做伪的感觉，因而会有罪过感。“双重思想”是英社的核心，因为党最基本的行为，是进行有意识的欺骗，同时又保持目的坚定性，那需要绝对诚实。讲着别有用心的谎言，同时又真心实意相信这些谎言；忘掉一切变得有碍的行为，然后一旦再次需要，又从遗忘中拣回来；否认客观现实的存在，同时又考虑到被否认的现实——这些都缺一不可。甚至在使用“双重思想”这个词时，也需要进行“双重思想”。因为使用这个词时，是承认在篡改现实，通过再来一次“双重思想”，就会清除这种认识，如此循环不已，谎言总跨在真实的前面。最终以“双重思想”为手段，党就能够——我们都明白，可能在几千年内继续能够——左右历史进程。

历史上所有寡头统治者都倒台了，是因为要么他们变得僵化，要么变得软弱，要么变得愚蠢自大，不能与时俱进地调整而被推翻，要么变得开明而且懦弱，在需要使用武力时却让步，所以也被推翻了。这就是说，他们倒台要么是有意识导致，要么是无意识。创造出两种情况并存的一种思想系统，这是党的成就，除此之外没有别的思想基础能让党的统治千秋万代。如果要实行统治并使之持续下去，就必须混淆现实感，因为统冶的秘决，在于把对自身永远正确的信念和从过去错误中吸取教训结合起来。

几乎勿庸置疑，“双重思想”最高明的实行者，是那些创造出“双重思想”并知晓它是种超级思想欺骗系统的人。我们这个社会上，对世事最明察的人也是最看不清其本质的人。总而言之，越是理解透彻，越是幻觉重重，越是聪明绝顶，越是头脑昏庸。一个明显的例证就是越往上层，战争的歇斯底里症就越厉害。对战争有着最接近理性认识的人，是被争夺地区的被统治对象，对他们而言，战争无非是持续不停的灾难，浪潮一样来回冲刷他们的身体。对他们来说，哪一方取得胜利完全无所谓，他们明白统治者变化无非意味着他们仍然要干同样的活，因为新主人会跟旧主人以同样方式对待他们。地位稍高一点，我们称之为“群众”的工人只是偶尔才意识到战争的存在。需要时，他们能被刺激进入恐惧和仇恨的狂热状态中，然而在被放任自流时，他们可以很长时间都想不起来正在打仗。真正的战争狂热存在于党内上下，特别在内党，相信能够征服世界的人，正是知道那是不可能的人。这种对立面的奇特联系——有知和无知，悲观怀疑和狂热盲信——正是大洋国社会有别于其他社会的显著标志。官方意识形态中充满自相矛盾之处，甚至有时也看不出有什么实际原因需要这样。因此党抛弃并贬低以前社会主义运动中采用的每种原则，而且决定以社会主义的名义这样做。党宣扬要对工人阶级采取轻视态度，这在前几个世纪都未曾有过。它要求党员穿上制服，那曾是体力劳动者的特别制服，党如此决定正是出于这一原因。党有系统地削弱家庭的稳固性，用一个能直接唤起家庭式忠诚的称呼来称其领导人。甚至统治我们的四个部的名称在蓄意混淆事实方面，也揭示了一种厚颜无耻的行径。和平部负责战争，真理部制造谎言，仁爱部负责拷打，富足部则制造饥饿。这些矛盾之处不是偶然，也不是一般的虚伪所致，而是精心运用“双重思想”的结果。因为只有通过调和矛盾，才能永远保住权力，要打破古老的循环别无他法。如果能做到永远避免人人平等——如果我们已经以高等阶层称之的那些人要永远保持统治地位——那么主要思想状态就必定是处于受控的疯狂状态。

然而仍然存在一个直到现在，我们险些将之忽略的问题，这就是：为何要避免人人平等？假设这一过程中的方法已得到正确说明，这种为了将历史凝固在某一特定时间的不遗余力、精确计划的全部努力出于何种动机？

至此，我们就要谈到最重要的奥秘。正如我们已经明白的，党的神秘性，最重要是内党的神秘性是依靠“双重思想”来实现的。然而比这更深一层就是最初的动机，也就是那种从未被怀疑过的本能，这种本能首先导致夺权，然后引出“双重思想”、思想警察、连绵不断的战争和随后出现的其他必要的那套东西。这种动机实际上包括……



温斯顿察觉到了寂静，就像察觉到新的声音一样，他觉得茱莉娅似乎有一阵子一动不动。她侧躺着，腰部往上光着身子，脸枕在手上，一络黑发散盖在她的眼睛上，她的乳房在缓慢而匀称地起伏。

“茱莉娅。”

没有回答。

“茱莉娅，你醒着吗？”

没有回答，她睡着了。他合上那本书，小心放在地板上，躺下来把床罩拉上来盖住两个人。

他想，他仍对最根本的秘密不得而知。他明白怎么做，却不明白为什么。第一章和第三章一样，并未告诉任何他以前不知道的事，只是把他已经掌握的知识系统化了。然而读过之后，他比以前更明白他没疯。作为少数派，即使是一个人的少数派，也并不能说明你疯了。世界上存在着真理和非真理，如果你坚守的是真理，即使要跟整个世界对抗，你也不会是疯的。正在下沉的夕阳把一缕黄色光线从窗户斜射进来照在枕头上。他闭上眼睛，照在脸上的阳光和挨着他的那个女孩的光滑躯体给了他一种强烈的、催人欲睡的、自信的感觉。他是安全的，一切正常。他嘴里咕哝着“理智不是个统计学概念”就睡着了，他觉得这句话蕴藏了深刻的智慧。

第十章


醒来后，温斯顿觉得自己已经睡了很长时间，可是扫了一眼老式时钟，才知道那时才二十点半。他躺着迷糊了一会儿，接着下面院子里又响起一如既往的低沉歌声：



这不过是种无用的幻想，

就像四月天般易逝。

但是一个眼神、一句话和唤起的梦啊，

已经把我的心儿窃取！



这首傻里傻气的歌曲似乎流行不衰，仍然到处都能听到，比那首《仇恨之歌》还要命长。茱莉娅听到唱歌，醒了，舒舒服服伸个懒腰就下了床。

“我饿了，”她说，“我再煮点咖啡。妈的！炉子里没油了，水也凉了。”她掂起炉子晃了晃。“里面没油了。”

“我估计可以从老查林顿那里弄一点。”

“奇怪，我肯定油原来是满的。我要穿上衣服，”她又说，“好像越来越冷。”

温斯顿也起床穿上了衣服。那个不曾疲倦的声音继续唱道：



他们说时间可以愈合一切，

说你早晚都会忘完。

但是多年前的笑容还有泪水，

仍把我的心儿给搅乱！



束紧工作服的腰带后，他踱到窗前。太阳一定是落到了房子那边，而不再直射着院子。石板是湿的，好像刚洗过，烟囱之间的天空蓝得那么鲜艳，他有种感觉是天空也洗过了。那个女人在不知疲倦地大步来回，衣服夹子噙在嘴里又取出，一会儿唱歌一会儿不出声，晾着一块又一块、取之不尽的尿布。他怀疑她是不是以洗衣为生，要么只是为二三十个孙辈操劳不已。茱莉娅来到他旁边，他们一起有点着迷地盯着下边那个身强体健的女人。他看着那个女人特有的举止，她粗壮的胳膊伸向晾衣绳，壮实得像母马一样的屁股往后撅着，他突然第一次想到她是漂亮的。这样一个五十岁的女人——由于生养而变得身躯庞大无比，然后由于干活而变得结实有力，直到粗糙到了骨子里，像是长得过了头的萝卜——他以前从未想过这种身体会是漂亮的，但的确如此。他想，到底为什么不可以说那是漂亮的？那具结实而全无曲线的、花岗岩一般的躯体再加上粗糙的红皮肤，它跟一个少女的躯体之间的关系，与玫瑰果跟玫瑰花之间的关系是一样的，但为何果实会被认为比不上花朵呢？

“她真漂亮。”

“她屁股那儿至少有一米阔。”茱莉娅说。

“那是她独特的美。”

他一只手就轻易把茱莉娅柔软的腰部搂了一圈。从臀到膝，她身体的一侧在贴着他。他们两人不会生出孩子来，永远做不到这点，他们只能通过说话互相传递头脑里的秘密。下面那个女人缺乏智力，她只有粗壮的胳膊、温暖的内心和多产的肚皮。温斯顿想知道她生了多少孩子，可能至少有十五个。她有过为期不长的花季年华，也许有一年像野蔷薇那样美丽。然后突然像个受了精的果实一样，她长得壮实、红润而且粗糙了，接着她的生活就一直是洗衣、拖地、缝补、做饭、扫地、擦亮东西、修理、拖地、洗衣，等等，先是给孩子，然后为孙辈，三十年如一日，从未间断过，到头来，她却依然在歌唱。不知为何，温斯顿对她所怀的神秘崇敬感跟烟囱帽后面天空的样子混合到了一起。那片天空苍白无云，向无限遥远的地方延伸着。想来奇怪，对每个人来说，天空都是同样的天空，无论在欧亚国或者东亚国或者这里。天底下的人们也几乎完全一样——在所有地方，包括全世界，有着上亿跟这里一样的人们，他们对彼此的存在一无所知，被仇恨和谎言之墙所隔，但仍然几乎完全一样。他们从未学会思考，但正是在他们的心里、肚子里和肌肉里，储备着某一天将推翻这个世界的力量。如果有希望，它就在群众身上！用不着非得把“那本书”读完，他就知道戈斯坦因最后要表达的一定也是此意。未来属于群众。不过他能不能肯定他们翻身做主人时，对他温斯顿来说，他们建立起的世界不会跟党的世界一样，让他感觉格格不入？对，他可以肯定，因为至少那将是个理智的世界。只要有平等，就会有理智。或早或晚，那都是将要发生的，力量会觉醒。群众是不朽的，看看院子里那个勇敢的女人，你就不会怀疑这点。最终他们会觉醒，直到那天到来之时——尽管可能要过一千年之久——他们会克服各种各样的困难活下来，像小鸟一样，从一个躯体向另一个躯体传递活力，那是党所缺乏的，也无法消灭。

“你还记不记得，”他问道，“第一天时，那只在树林边上对着我们唱歌的画眉？”

“它没在对着我们唱，”茱莉娅说，“它在自娱自乐，甚至也不能那么说，它只是在唱歌而已。”

小鸟唱歌，群众唱歌，党不唱歌。在全世界，在伦敦和纽约，在非洲、巴西和边界那边的神秘禁地，在巴黎和柏林的街上，在无限广袤的俄国平原上的村庄里，在中国、日本的集市上——每个地方，都伫立着同样的坚强而且无法被征服的身躯，由于干活和生养而变得身躯庞大，从生下来一直劳累到死去，却仍然在唱着歌。正是从她们强壮的两腿间，总有一天会诞生一个自知自觉的种族。你们是死人，他们拥有的是未来。但如果你能像他们那样保持躯体活着，让自己的大脑不死，并把二加二等于四这种秘密教义传下去，你就也能分享到未来。

“我们是死人。”他说。

“我们是死人。”茱莉娅顺从地附和道。

“你们是死人。”他们身后响起一个冷酷的声音。

他们一下子分开了。温斯顿似乎感到五内俱寒，他看到茱莉娅瞪圆了眼睛，她的脸色变成了奶黄色。仍然留在她脸颊上的两个胭脂块格外显眼，几乎像是要浮离下面的皮肤。

“你们是死人。”那个冷酷的声音又说。

“在画后面。”茱莉娅轻声说。

“在画后面。”那个声音说，“站着不许动，没有命令一步也不许动。”

来了，终于来了！他们除了看着对方的眼睛，什么也不能做。去逃命，在尚不太晚前离开这座房屋——他们从未动过这些念头，不可想象敢于违抗传自墙上的冷酷声音之命。只听见啪的一声，好像一个锁扣又被扣上，还有打碎玻璃的声音。那张画掉到地上，露出后面的电屏。

“现在他们能看见我们了。”茱莉娅说。

“现在我们能看见你们了。”那个声音说，“站在房间中央，背靠背。手抱在脑袋背后。不准互相接触。”

他们没接触，但他似乎能感觉到茱莉娅的身子在颤抖，也许只是他自己在颤抖。他只能控制住不让自己的牙齿打战，可他的膝盖不听使唤。楼下响起了皮靴声，房内房外都是。院子里好像挤满了人，有什么东西被人在石板上拖着。那个女人的歌声突然停止了。又响起在地上滚动的长长的声音，似乎是洗衣盆被扔得从院子这头滚到了那头。接着是十分混乱的愤怒呼喊声，最后是一声痛苦的号叫。

“房子被包围了。”温斯顿说。

“房子被包围了。”那个声音说。

他听到茱莉娅在咬紧牙关。“我想我们最好还是说再见吧。”她说。

“你们最好还是说再见吧。”那个声音说。接着，另一个很不一样的声音插了进来，那是个细细的文雅声音，温斯顿感觉似曾相识。“另外，顺便说句不跑题的话：‘这儿有支蜡烛照着你去睡觉，这儿有把斧头把你的头剁掉！’”

温斯顿背后，有什么东西砸到了床上。一个梯子头从窗口伸进来，压坏了窗户框，有人正在从窗口爬进来。上楼梯的皮靴声也响了起来，房间里站满身穿黑色制服的彪形大汉，脚上穿着钉了铁掌的皮靴，手里拿着警棍。

温斯顿不再颤抖了，连眼睛也几乎没转动。只有一件事要紧：保持别动，保持别动，以免让他们有理由打你！一个长着像职业拳击手的那种扁平下巴，嘴巴只是一条缝的男人跟他面对面站着，用拇指和食指掂着警棍，像是在考虑什么事情一样，把它上下晃悠着。温斯顿跟他的视线接触了一下。那种暴露的感觉，也就是手放在头后面，脸和身子完全没有遮挡时的感觉无法忍受。那个人把白色的舌尖伸出来舔了一下应该是嘴唇的地方，然后走了过去。又听见啪的一声，有人从桌子那里拿起玻璃镇纸把它砸到壁炉底部的石头上摔成碎片。

那一小片珊瑚——一片小而起皱的粉红色东西，像是蛋糕上的糖制玫瑰花蓓蕾——滚过了床垫。温斯顿想，它多么小啊，它总是多么小！他听到在背后有吸气的声音，接着砰的一声，他的脚踝被狠狠踢了一脚，让他的身体猛然几乎失去平衡。有个男人一拳捅在茱莉娅的肚子上，她痛得像把折尺般弓着腰在地板上猛烈扭动着，难以出上来气。温斯顿根本不敢把头转动哪怕一毫米，但有时能从眼角看到她那张苍白的脸庞，正在大口喘气。即使他自己也是满怀恐惧，但似乎他身上也能感受到那种痛楚，可是对茱莉娅来说，比彻骨痛楚更紧迫的是要能喘上来气。然后，有两个人拉着膝盖和肩膀把她像麻袋一样抬走了。温斯顿扫了一眼她的脸庞，是在朝着地上，显出黄色而且变了形，眼睛闭着，脸颊上仍有胭脂印。那是他最后一眼看到她。

他站在那里一动也不动，还没有人打他。几点想法很快自动闪现在他的脑海，但似乎完全不能让他感兴趣。他想知道他们是不是也把查林顿先生抓起来了，也想知道他们把院子里那个女人怎么样了。他注意到尿很憋，也略微感到吃惊，因为他只是两三个钟头前才尿过。他注意到壁炉台上的时钟指着九点钟，也就是二十一点。可是光线好像太强了。八月傍晚的光线到二十一点时不是越来越暗淡吗？他怀疑是不是说到底，是他和茱莉娅把时间弄错了——他们多睡了十二个小时，当时其实是第二天早晨八点半。不过他没再往下多想，没有意义。

过道里又响起轻一些的走路声，查林顿先生进了房间，那些穿黑制服的突然变得恭顺了些。查林顿先生的外表也有了些变化。他的眼光落到玻璃镇纸的碎片上。

“把碎片拣起来。”他厉声说道。

有人弯腰从命。查林顿先生话里的土腔消失了。温斯顿突然意识到刚才从电屏里听到的就是那个声音。查林顿先生仍然穿着那件旧丝绒夹克，但是他一直几乎是全白的头发又变成了黑色，也没再戴着眼镜了。他向温斯顿狠狠盯了一眼，似乎在对他验明正身，然后就不再多看他一眼。仍能将他认出来，但是变了个人。他的身体挺得直了，好像比以前魁梧些。他的脸庞只有很少变化，但足以让他面目全非。他的眉毛没那么浓密了，皱纹不见了，整个脸部轮廓似乎改变了，甚至鼻子也似乎短了些。这是张属于五十三岁左右的人警觉而严肃的脸庞。温斯顿想到这是他生平第一次心里明白地看着一位思想警察。





第三部





第一章


他不知道自己身在何处，大概在仁爱部，然而没办法确定。他是在一间天花板很高、没有窗户的牢房里，墙上贴着亮闪闪的瓷砖，隐藏的电灯以冷光照亮了整间牢房，另外还有种低沉的、一刻不停的嗡嗡声，估计跟换气系统有关。除了牢门那里，四面墙上都安了条宽度刚好能坐上的长凳或者说搁板。对面有个马桶，可是没有垫板。牢房内有四张电屏，每面墙上一张。

他感到腹内隐隐作痛，自从被推进一辆没有窗的囚车带走以来，就一直感到那里疼。但他也感到饥饿，那是种折磨人的、影响健康的饥饿。他可能有一天时间没吃过东西了，也可能是一天半，他也不知道——很可能永远也不会知道——他被捕时是上午还是晚上。被捕以来，他就没再吃过东西。

他坐在那道窄窄的长凳上尽量一动不动，双手交叉放在膝盖上，他已经学会一动不动地坐着。如果你做出意外的动作，他们会通过电屏喝斥。想吃东西的渴望却越来越强烈。他最想吃的是一片面包，他想到工作服口袋里还有几片面包皮，甚至有可能——他这样想，是因为好像有什么东西不时蹭他的腿——口袋里还有不小的一块面包。到最后，想弄个明白的诱惑压过了恐惧，他悄悄把一只手伸进口袋。

“史密斯！”电屏里传来一声喝斥，“六零七九号温斯顿·史密斯！在牢房里不准把手放进口袋！”

他又一动不动地坐着，双手交叉放在膝盖上。被带到这里之前，他被带到另外一个地方待了段时间，那肯定是巡逻队使用的一个普通临时拘留所。他不知道在那里待了多长时间，不管怎样，会有几小时，在没有时钟也没有日光的情况下，难以判断有多长时间。那是个闹哄哄、臭气冲天的地方，他曾被关在跟现在这间差不多大的牢房里，可那间脏得要命，而且总是挤满十到十五个人。他们中的大多数是普通罪犯，但其中也有几个政治犯。他一直靠着墙不作声地坐着，被身上肮脏的人挤来挤去，他的心思全被恐惧和腹部的疼痛所占据，因此对周围之事兴趣不大，不过他还是留意到党员囚犯和其他囚犯在行为上有极大差别。党员囚犯总默不作声，一副害怕的样子，普通囚犯倒像谁都不放在眼里。他们高声咒骂看守，在财物被没收时奋力还击，在地板上写下流话，还把食物藏在衣服里不知什么地方偷偷带进牢房，电屏里传来想维持秩序的声音时，他们甚至嚷得比它的声音还大。另外，他们中间有几个似乎跟看守的关系很要好，他们喊看守的外号，并花言巧语从他们那里骗到烟卷，从门上的观察孔塞进来。看守对待普通囚犯时，也有一定的宽容，尽管他们也必须粗暴对待他们。他们经常谈论劳改营的事，大多数囚犯都要被送进那里。温斯顿听明白了，如果能跟别人搞好关系，懂得决窍，劳改营也“不赖”。劳改营里有各种各样的行贿受贿、开后门和敲诈勒索行为，也有同性恋和卖淫行为，甚至还有用土豆做的非法蒸馏酒。被寄予信任的总是普通囚犯，特别是歹徒和杀人犯，他们组成类似贵族的群体。所有脏活累活都让政治犯来干。

临时拘留所里各种各样的囚犯走马灯般来来去去：毒品贩子、小偷、强盗、黑市交易者、醉汉、妓女，等等。有些醉汉很凶，别的囚犯不得不合力把他制伏。有个身躯巨大、六十岁左右的女人被四个看守一人抓着一条腿或胳膊抬进来，她仍在乱蹬乱嚷，她的乳房沉甸甸地垂着，一头浓密的白色卷发在挣扎时散开了。几个看守扯下她用力踢人的靴子，然后隔着温斯顿的大腿就把她撂了过来，几乎把他的大腿骨压碎。那个女人坐正身子后向看守的背影大声嚷道：“操你们这些杂种！”然后她注意到自己坐得不平，就滑下温斯顿的膝盖坐到长凳上。

“请原谅，亲爱的。”她说，“我也不想坐到你身上，只是那几个该死的家伙把我撂这儿了。他们不知道怎么对待女士，对不对？”她停下来，拍拍胸口打了个嗝。“请原谅，我不大舒服。”

她身子前俯，往地板上吐了一大摊东西。

“好点了。”她说着把身子向后靠并闭上了眼睛。“我的意思是千万别忍着，趁在胃里还没消化的时候吐出来。”

她恢复过来了，转过身子又看了一眼温斯顿，似乎一下子就喜欢上了他。她伸出一条粗壮的胳膊搭在温斯顿的肩上并把他扳向自己，她嘴里的啤酒和呕吐味直冲温斯顿的脸庞。

“你姓啥，亲爱的？”

“史密斯。”温斯顿说。

“史密斯？”那个女人说，“怪了，我也姓史密斯。怎么回事呢？”她又感伤地说，“我有可能是你妈！”

温斯顿想，她真有可能是他母亲，她们两人的岁数和体形都差不多，人们在劳改营里过二十年多少会有点变化，很有可能。

别的囚犯没一个跟他说话。很奇怪的是，普通囚犯对党员囚犯视而不见，他们称党员囚犯为“党棍”，语气里带着轻蔑和不屑。党员囚犯似乎害怕跟别人说话，最主要的，是害怕互相交谈。只有一次，两个女党员在长凳上被挤到一块时，一片嘈杂中，温斯顿无意听到她们很快交谈了几句，特别提到所谓的“一零一房间”，他不知道是什么意思。

可能在两三个小时前，他们把他带到了这里。他腹部的隐痛从未消退过，只是有时轻，有时厉害些，他的思绪也随之开阔或紧缩。疼得厉害时，他想到的只是疼痛本身和想吃东西的渴望。感觉好一些时，他陷入恐慌。有时他真真切切预见到将要遭遇什么事时，他的心头乱跳，屏住呼吸。他感到警棍打在他的肘部，钉了铁掌的靴子踢在他小腿肚上；他看到自己在地上爬行，嘴里的牙齿被打落，但还在尖叫着请求饶恕。他几乎没怎么想起茱莉娅，没办法把心思固定在她身上。他爱她，不会背叛她，但那只是一项事实，他像知道算术规则一样知道这件事实。他感觉不到对她的爱，也几乎没怎么想她会遭遇何事。他想起奥布兰的时候更多，还怀着一丝希望。奥布兰肯定知道他被捕了。正如他曾经说过的，兄弟会从不营救自己的成员，不过还有剃须刀片，他们在能做到的情况下会送进来。看守冲进牢房之前，他或许有五分钟时间可用。剃须刀片带着灼人的冰冷感觉割进他的身体，甚至拿着它的手指也会被割到骨头。他那种病躯的所有感觉全回来了，即使是最轻的痛楚，也让他缩着身子颤抖不已，他拿不准就算他有机会使用剃须刀片，他究竟会不会用。更为理所当然的是活一时算一时，即使肯定到最后还是要被拷打，多活上十分钟也好。

有时他试图计算出牢房墙上瓷砖的数量，应该不难，但他总是或早或晚忘了数到多少。更多时候，他琢磨的是自己身在何处和当时是几点钟的问题。有一阵子，他感到很肯定外面是一片光明，再过一阵，他又同样肯定地觉得外面是一片漆黑。在这里，他本能地知道电灯永远不会关，这是个没有黑暗的地方。他现在才明白为何奥布兰似乎明白他那句话里的暗示。仁爱部里没有窗户，他所在的牢房也许在大楼的中心部位，或者挨着外墙，又可能在地下十层或者地上三十层。想象中，他把自己换了一个又一个地方，试图通过身体的感觉，来确定自己是在高高的空中还是深深的地下。

外面响起皮靴走路的声音。铁门当的一声打开，一个年轻警官敏捷地一步跨入。他身穿整洁的黑制服，浑身上下像擦亮的皮革一样闪闪发光，他苍白而缺乏表情的脸庞像是蜡制面具。他向外面的看守示意把领来的囚犯带进来。诗人安普福斯踉跄着走进牢房，铁门当的一声又关上了。

安普福斯拿不准似的左右挪动，似乎觉得有另外一扇门可以出去，然后就开始在牢房里踱来踱去。他还没有注意到温斯顿也在里边，他不安的眼神盯着温斯顿头部上方高一米的墙上。他没有穿鞋，又大又脏的脚趾从袜子洞住外伸着。他也有几天没刮脸了，一脸又短又硬的胡须长得到颧骨那里都是，让他有了副凶逞之徒的样子，跟他高大而虚弱的身体和不安的动作形成奇特的反差。

温斯顿尽管疲倦，还是坐直了一点身子。他必须跟安普福斯说话，即使要冒着被电屏里的声音喝斥的危险。甚至可能想象安普福斯身负夹带刀片之命。

“安普福斯。”他说。

电屏里没有传来喝斥声。安普福斯停下脚步，有点吃了一惊。他的两眼慢慢聚焦到了温斯顿身上。

“啊，史密斯！”他说，“你也在！”

“你怎么也进来了？”

“跟你说实话——”他在温斯顿对面的长凳上别别扭扭地坐了下来。“只有一种过错，对不对？”他说。

“你犯了吗？”

“我显然犯了。”

他把一只手放到前额上压了太阳穴一会儿，似乎想记起来什么事。

“这种情况是有的，”他含糊地说，“我能想到的有一次——可能就是那次。那是不谨慎，一点儿没错。我们当时正在为吉卜林(1)的诗歌创作出定稿，我在其中一行的末尾保留了‘上帝’这个词，我也是没办法！”他抬眼看着温斯顿，几乎是愤慨地又说道，“那一行没法改，那首的韵脚是‘棍子’(2)，你知不知道英语里总共只有十二个词跟‘棍子’押韵？我一连几天绞尽脑汁地想，但的确没有其他可以押韵的词。”

他的表情变了，暂时没了恼怒感，看上去几乎是高兴的。从他又短又硬的肮脏胡须上，绽放出一种知识分子式的激动，是某个学究发现一件无用事实时的喜悦。

“你有没有想到过，”他说，“整个英语诗史都受到了英语缺乏韵脚这一事实的决定性影响？”

没有，温斯顿从未想到过这一点，但此情此景，这也不能让他觉得很重要或者有趣。

“你知不道现在是几点钟？”他问道。

安普福斯好像又吃了一惊。“我几乎从来没想过这个问题。他们可能是两天或者三天前抓到我的。”他眼睛在墙上扫来扫去，似乎有点想在哪里找到窗户。“这种地方白天黑夜没什么差别，我不明白怎样才能计算出是几点了。”

他们前言不搭后语地又谈了几分钟，冷不防从电屏里传来要他们住嘴的喝斥。温斯顿平静地坐着，两手交叉着。安普福斯的身躯庞大得没法舒舒服服地坐在窄凳子上，他不安地扭来扭去，瘦长的两手一会儿扣着一个膝盖，然后再换到另一个上。电屏里传来命令，厉声要求他老老实实坐着。时间在流逝，二十分钟，一小时——难以判断。外面再次响起皮靴声，温斯顿的心头一紧。很快，非常之快，也许再过五分钟，也许就是现在，皮靴声会意味着轮到他了。

门打开，那个冷面的年轻警官跨进牢房，手向安普福斯一指。

“一零一房间。”他说。

安普福斯被两个看守夹在中间脚步蹒跚地走了出去，他脸上隐约显出不安的样子，但仍是一副迷惘相。

好像又过去很长一段时间，温斯顿的腹部疼得更厉害些了，他的心思在同一段轨道上来来回回，就像一个球次次掉进同一道狭槽。他只能想到六件事：腹部的疼痛，一块面包，流血和呼号，奥布兰，茱莉娅，剃须刀片。这时，他心头又是猛地一紧，沉重的皮靴声越响越近。铁门打开时，它制造出的气流带进一股刺鼻难闻的冷汗味道。帕森斯走进牢房，他穿着卡其布短裤和一件运动衫。

这次温斯顿吃惊得有点忘了场合。

“你也进来了！”

帕森斯瞥了温斯顿一眼，眼神里既不是感兴趣，也不是吃惊，而只是痛苦。他开始急冲冲地走来走去，显然无法不动。每次他伸直胖乎乎的膝关节时，那里显然在颤抖。他的眼睛圆睁着，像在盯着什么，似乎他无法忍住不看那不远处一样。

“你怎么进来了？”温斯顿问他。

“思想罪！”帕森斯几乎是抽噎着说，他的声调听上去一方面是完全服罪，另外还有种不敢相信的震惊感，就是这个词居然会用到自己身上。他在温斯顿对面停下脚步，开始急切地向他诉说：“你不会认为他们会枪毙我吧，对不对，老兄？如果你没有真的做什么事——只是个念头，那是你无法控制的——他们不会枪毙你，对不对？我知道他们会给我辩解的机会。噢，我相信他们会那样做！他们了解我过去的表现，对不对？你了解我是什么样的人，我不能算是坏人。不算聪明，这不用说，可是热心。我一向全心全意为党服务，不是吗？我会被判五年就够了，你觉得呢？要么甚至十年？像我这样的伙计在劳改营里会很有用，他们不会因为我做错一次就枪毙我吧？”

“你有罪吗？”

“我当然有罪！”帕森斯嚷道，还奴性十足地看了一眼电屏。“你不是认为党会逮捕一个无辜的人吧？”他长得像青蛙一般的脸庞平静了一点，甚至略微带上了虔诚的表情。“思想罪是件可怕的事，老兄。”他用教育人的语气说，“它很阴险，能在你根本不知道的时候控制你。你知道它是怎么控制我的？在我睡觉的时候！对，这是事实。你看我，一天到晚都在工作，尽我的本分——从来根本不知道我的思想里有坏东西，后来我就开始说起梦话。你知道他们听到我说什么吗？”

他压低嗓子，好像某个人为了治病的原因而说一句下流话。

“‘打倒老大哥！’对，我说了！好像说了一遍又一遍。老兄，我这是跟你说，我很高兴在我还没有进一步发展前，他们就抓到了我。你知不知道到了法庭上我会怎么跟他们说？‘谢谢你们，’我会说，‘谢谢你们及时挽救了我。’”

“谁检举的你？”温斯顿问他。

“是我的小女儿。”帕森斯半是伤心，半是自豪地说，“她从锁眼里听到的。她听到我那样说，第二天就去巡逻队报告了。对一个七岁的小家伙来说，够聪明的了，对不对？我一点也不埋怨她，事实上我还为她自豪呢。不管怎样，这说明我已经把她培养上了正路。”

他又急冲冲地走来走去，向马桶渴望地瞟了好几眼。到后来，他突然猛地扯下短裤。

“对不起，伙计，”他说，“我忍不住了，憋着呢。”

他的大屁股一下坐到马桶上。温斯顿用手捂住了脸。

“史密斯！”电屏里传来了喝斥的声音，“六零七九号温斯顿·史密斯！把手放下来，在牢房里不准捂着脸！”

史密斯放下手。帕森斯在马桶上排便，声音很大，泄得干净。接下来才知道抽水装置有毛病，牢房里一连几个小时都臭气熏天。

帕森斯被带走了，更多囚犯被神秘地带来又被带走。有个女人被带去“一零一房间”，温斯顿留意到她听到那个词似乎瘫掉了，甚至脸色也变了。到后来——如果他是上午被带来这个地方的，那就是在下午，如果他是下午被带来的，那就是在午夜——当时牢房里有六个人，有男有女，全一动不动地坐着。温斯顿的对面有个男人，胖得没了下巴，牙齿外露，特别像是某种个头很大、于人无害的啮齿动物。他红一块白一块的胖脸颊下部有很明显的颊袋，很难不让人以为他在那里还藏了点食物。他那双灰白色眼睛胆怯地在人们的脸上扫来扫去，接触别人的眼光时，他马上望向别处。

铁门开了，又一个囚犯被带进来，他的外表让温斯顿心头一惊。他是个普普通通、长相猥琐的男人，也许是个工程师或技术员之类。但是让人吃惊的是他脸部的瘦削程度。他像一具骷髅，出于瘦的原因，他的嘴巴和眼睛大得不成比例，而且那双眼睛里，似乎充满对某人或某物杀气腾腾、不可遏止的仇恨。

那个男人在离温斯顿不远的凳子上坐下。温斯顿没再多看他一眼，那张骷髅一般的痛苦脸庞在他脑海里的形象却特别鲜明，以至于好像就在他眼前。突然，他意识到了是怎么回事：那个男人快饿死了。好像牢房里的每个人在同一时刻，都想到了同样的事，长凳上出现一阵轻微的骚动。无下巴男人不停扫视那个脸似骷髅的人，然后内疚地转过眼，接着又被一种不可抗拒的吸引力拉了回来。很快，他在那里坐不安稳了，最后他站起来，蹒跚地走到牢房这边，把手深深掏进他的工作服口袋，然后带着难为情的神色拿出一片肮脏的面包，送到脸似骷髅的男人面前。

电屏里传来暴怒的、震耳欲聋的咆哮声，无下巴的男人一下子跳起来，脸似骷髅的男人迅速把手放到背后，似乎在向全世界表明他拒绝了馈赠。

“巴姆斯德！”那个声音在咆哮，“二七一三号巴姆斯德！把面包扔到地上！”

无下巴男人把面包扔到地上。

“站着不准动，”那个声音说，“面朝门，不准动。”

无下巴男人服从了，他有袋的面颊在不可控制地颤抖着。铁门当的一声开了，那个年轻警官进来迈到一边，从他背后，闪现出一个膀阔胳膊粗的矮胖看守。他在无下巴男人的对面站定，然后在警官的示意下凶猛地挥了一拳，这用尽全力的一击结结实实砸在无下巴男人的嘴部，劲道之足好像几乎把他打得飞了起来。他的身体一下子从牢房这头跌到那头，只是马桶底座挡住了他的身体。有一阵子，他躺在那里好像晕了过去，殷红的鲜血从他的口鼻里涌了出来。他发出了很微弱的呜咽或者说是吱吱声，似乎是在无意识状态下发出的。接着他翻了个身，歪歪斜斜地以手撑地跪了起来。在淌着的血和唾液中，他的上下两排假牙全掉了出来。

囚犯全一动不动坐着，手全交叉放在膝盖上。无下巴男人爬回坐的地方。他一侧脸庞的下部变得乌青，嘴巴肿成了不辨形状的一团肉，呈樱桃色，中间是嘴巴的黑洞。

不时有少量鲜血滴到他工作服的胸前位置上。他那双灰白色眼睛仍在各人脸上扫来扫去，显得更加心虚，似乎想弄清楚别人因为他丢人现眼而鄙视他到了什么程度。

铁门开了。年轻警官做了个小小的手势，指着的是那个脸似骷髅的男人。

“一零一房间。”

温斯顿旁边有人抽了口冷气，另外还有一阵骚动。那个男人几乎是一下子跪倒在地板上，十指交错地扣着双手。

“同志！长官！”他叫道，“别带我去那里！我不是什么都向您交代了吗？您还想知道什么？我全坦白出来，全部！只要告诉我您想知道什么，我全坦白！写下来我就会签字——什么都行！别带我去一零一房间！”

“一零一房间。”警官说。

那个男人的脸庞本来已经很苍白，当时也变了颜色，温斯顿本来还不相信。那绝对是一层青色，不可能弄错。

“对我怎么样都行！”他喊道，“你们已经几个星期没让我吃东西了，干脆让我死了吧。枪毙我，吊死我，判我二十五年吧。你们还想让我把谁供出来？你们只用说是谁，想让我说什么我就会说什么，不管是谁，你们怎么样处置他我都无所谓。我有老婆，还有三个孩子，最大的还不到六岁，您可以把他们全带走，在我面前割断他们的喉管，我会在旁边看，可是别带我去一零一房间！”

“一零一房间。”警官说。

那个男人发狂似的看了一圈其他囚犯，似乎想到了找另外一个替死鬼的办法。他的眼睛落到了无下巴男人被打开花的脸上，他突然伸出一条瘦削的胳膊。

“您应该带走的是他，不是我！”他大喊大叫，“您没听到他的脸被打以后他说了什么话。给我一个机会吧，他说的每个字我都说给您听。他才是反党的，我不是。”看守往前跨了一步，那个男人的声音变成了尖叫，“您没听到他说什么！”他还在重复着，“电屏出毛病了。他才是你们要抓的，带他走，别带我！”

两个强壮的看守上前要抓住他的胳膊，但就在那时，他身子在牢房的地板上一扑，抓住了撑着长凳的一根铁腿，像头野兽一样，发出没有词的嗥叫。两个看守抓住他想把他扯开，他却以惊人的力气不放手。在也许有二十秒的时间里，他们在拉扯着他。囚犯全一动不动地坐着，手交叉放在膝盖上，眼睛正视前方。嗥叫声已经停止，那个男人除了抓紧，再也没力气发出别的声音。接着他又发出了另外一种哭叫，有个看守用皮靴踢断了他一只手的手指。他们把他拖起来。

“一零一房间。”警官说。

那个男人被带了出去，蹒跚地走着，垂着头，捧着被踢伤的那只手，不再有一丝反抗。

又过了很久。如果那个脸似骷髅的男人是在午夜时被带走的，到那时就是上午；如果是在上午被带走的，到那时就是下午。温斯顿独自待在牢房里，已经达几小时。窄窄的凳子让他坐得疼痛，不得不经常起身走动一下，也没有受到电屏的斥责。那一小片面包还在那个没下巴的男人丢下的地方。一开始，他需要费很大劲才不去看它，但是不久口渴就更甚于饥饿感。他嘴巴发黏，还有恶臭。嗡嗡声和恒久的白色灯光给他的头脑带来一种晕眩和空洞感。他要站起来，是因为他疼到了骨头里，无法忍受，但几乎马上又坐了下来，因为感到太眩晕，弄不准他还能不能够站立。每当他身体上的感觉稍微可以控制时，那种恐怖感就会回来。有时，他怀着越来越小的希望想着奥布兰和剃须刀片。如果早晚会给他东西吃，可以想象他会拿到藏在食物里的剃须刀片。茱莉娅也依稀出现在他的脑海。她正在某个地方受苦，也许比他受的苦要大得多。她可能此时正在号呼叫痛。他想：“如果能把我的疼痛增加一倍就能救下茱莉娅，我会那样做吗？对，我会的。”但那只是理智状态下所做的决定，之所以如此决定，是因为他应该这样做。他没感觉到那种疼痛，在这种地方，除了疼痛和预知将有的疼痛，感觉不到其他任何事情。再说，当你真的在承受疼痛时，不管出于何种原因，还有可能你希望再增加自己的疼痛吗？到目前为止，这一问题仍无法回答。

又听到皮靴声越来越近。铁门打开，奥布兰走进来。

温斯顿一下子站起来，看到奥布兰，让他震惊得完全忘了应该更谨慎一点。他忘了电屏的存在，这是许多年来的第一次。

“他们也抓到你了！”他嚷道。

“他们很久以前就抓到我了，”奥布兰说，话里带着不温不火、几乎有歉意的讽刺味。他往旁边一让，在他身后出现一个胸部浑阔的看守，手里拎了根长长的警棍。

“你是知道的，温斯顿。”奥布兰说，“别再自己骗自己了，你以前就知道——你一直知道。”

对，他现在明白了，他一直就知道，可是已经没有时间想这些。他眼睛盯着的，只是看守手里的警棍。它有可能落在任何地方：头顶，耳朵，上臂，肘部——

在肘部！他猛然跪了下来，身体几乎瘫软，他用手紧捂被打了的肘部，眼前直冒金星。没想到，真没想到打一下就能那么疼！眼前冒过金星之后，他能看到另外两个人在俯视着他，看守在嘲笑他那扭曲的身体。总算有个问题得到了解答，不管有什么理由，你永远不会希望增加疼痛。对于疼痛，你只有一个希望，那就是让它停止。世界上没有比身体上的疼痛更糟糕的事情，疼痛面前没有英雄，没有英雄。他徒劳地抱紧被打伤的左臂在地上翻滚时，这样想了一遍又一遍。

第二章


他躺在像是张行军床之类的东西上，不过离地面更高一些。他被绑在床上动弹不得，似乎有比平时更强的灯光正好照在他脸上。奥布兰站在他旁边，目不转睛俯视着他。在他的另一侧，站着个身穿白大褂、手持注射器的人。

即使睁开眼睛后，他仍然只是逐渐看清了周围的东西。他有种印象他是从一个很不相同的世界游进了这个房间，那里有点像是个在房间之下很深的水下世界。他不知道在那里已有多久，自从他们逮捕他之后，他就再也没有见过黑夜或者白天。另外，他的记忆也不连贯，有时他的意识完全停止了，就连睡觉时也是，然后在一段空白期后又重新拥有，然而他无从得知间隔究竟是几天、几周还是只有几秒钟。

从第一次肘部被打以来，噩梦便开始了。后来，他意识到当时发生的全部，只是个前奏而已，是差不多每个囚犯都须经过的常规审问。罪行很广泛——间谍、破坏之类——不言而喻的是每个人都会坦白。坦白是种例行手续，拷打则是实实在在的。他不记得他被殴打过多少次以及每次殴打持续多久，总有五六个身穿黑制服的人在同时殴打他，有时用拳头，有时用警棍，有时用钢棍，有时用皮靴。很多次他在地上滚来滚去，像头牲畜一样不知羞耻地扭来扭去，一直在企图躲避脚踢，然而没用，那样只不过招致被踢得更多，就在肋骨、腹部、肘部、小腿、腹股沟、睾丸、尾骨等地方。有许多次，这种毒打没完没了，到最后对他来说，残酷邪恶、无法原谅的事情不是看守不停殴打他，而是他无法强迫自己变得不省人事。许多次他完全吓破了胆，以至于甚至在毒打开始前，就喊着求饶，只是看到一个拳头往回收准备击打时，也能让他一股脑儿坦白出真实或者想象出来的罪行。有许多次，他决心什么也不说，每个字只能在他忍疼吸气的间隙从他嘴里挤出来。还有许多次，他软弱无力地想妥协，会对自己说：“我会坦白，但不是现在。我一定要坚持到疼痛变得不可忍受时。再被踢三下，再被踢两下，我就会告诉他们想知道的事。”有时他一直被殴打到几乎无法站立，然后像袋土豆一样，被扔到牢房的石头地板上，让他恢复几个小时，然后又被拖出去再次殴打。还有些时候恢复的时间较长一些，他只是隐约记得，因为在那些时候，他要么在睡觉，要么处于昏迷中。他记得住进过一间牢房，里面有张木板床，一个从墙上突出来，类似搁板的东西，洗脸盆，还吃到了有热汤、面包和偶尔有咖啡的几顿饭。他记得有个粗鲁的理发匠来给他理发剃须，另外还有些身穿白大褂的公事公办、缺乏同情心的人，他们量他的脉博，测试他的反应，翻开他的眼皮，用粗糙的手指摸索他有无骨折，还往他手臂上打针让他入睡。

殴打没那么厉害了，而主要变成一种威胁，一种在他回答得让人不满意时，随时会继续殴打他的恐惧感。审讯他的不再是身穿黑制服的暴徒，而是党员知识分子，都是些动作敏捷、戴着亮闪闪眼镜的矮胖男人，他们轮番审问他，一次持续——他觉得有，没办法肯定——十到十二个小时。这些后来的审讯者确保他处于不厉害的疼痛中，但他们并非主要靠让他疼痛。他们抽他耳光，扭他的耳朵，让他单足站立，扯他的头发，不允许他去小便，用眩目的电灯照射他的脸，直到他的眼泪止不住流出来，但他们这样做的目的，只是羞辱他并摧毁他争辩和推理的能力。他们真正的武器，是残酷无情地对他审讯得没完没了，一小时接一小时，提出迷惑性的问题，让他说出不想说的话，给他设置陷阱，歪曲他所讲的一切，证明他每次都在撒谎和说话自相矛盾，直到他既是因为羞愧，也是因为精神疲劳而哭了起来，有时在一次审讯中，他会哭上十几次。几乎每次审讯时，他们都会高声辱骂他，每次回答得迟疑时，都会威胁要把他交回看守。有时他们却突然改变语气，称他为同志，以英社和老大哥的名义向他恳求，不无伤感地问他即使到了现在，他还有没有剩下对党的足够忠诚，希望洗刷自己的罪恶。经过几小时审讯，他的神经处于崩溃状态时，就连这种恳求的话，也能让他涕泪交流。到了最后，那种唠唠叨叨的声音跟看守的皮靴及拳头比起来，能让他垮掉得更彻底些。简而言之，他成了让他说什么就说什么的嘴巴，让他签什么就签什么的一只手。他唯一关心的，是发现他们想让他坦白什么，然后在凌辱再次开始前很快坦白出来。他坦白自己刺杀了党的高级干部，散发煽动性的小册子，贪污公款，出卖军事秘密，进行各种各样的破坏活动，等等。他坦白早至一九六八年，他就是东亚国的间谍。他坦白自己是个宗教信徒，是资本主义的崇拜者和性变态者。他坦白自己杀害了妻子，尽管他知道，审讯他的人肯定也知道，他的妻子还活着。他坦白许多年来，他跟戈斯坦因保持个人联系，还是某地下组织的成员，该组织几乎包括所有他认识的人。坦白一切，牵连进所有人，这样也较为容易，再说从某种意义上说这都没错。没错，他是党的敌人，在党看来，思想和行为之间无任何区别。

然而也出现了另外一些记忆，孤立地出现在他脑海里，就像一圈全是黑色的照片。

他是在一间不知是明是暗的牢房里，因为除了一双眼睛看不到别的。近在咫尺，有台仪器正缓慢而有规律地滴滴答答走着。那双眼睛变得越来越大，越来越亮，突然他从座位上漂浮起来，跳进那双眼睛便被吞没。

他被绑在一张周围都是仪表的扶手椅上，头上有眩目的电灯，一个白大褂正在读仪表。从外面传来沉重的皮靴声，铁门当的一声打开，那个长着蜡像脸的警官走进来，后面跟着两个看守。

“一零一房间。”那个警官说。

那个身穿白大褂的人没转身，也没看温斯顿，只是在看仪表。

他正转动轮椅通过一个极阔的走廊，它有一公里宽，被灿烂的金色光线照彻。他用最大的嗓门哈哈大笑，并喊叫着坦白的话。他什么都坦白，甚至把被拷打时挺住没说的话也坦白了。他在把他一生的全部历史讲给一个已全部知悉的听众听。跟他在一起的有看守、其他审讯者、那个白大褂、奥布兰、茱利娅、查林顿先生等，他们全都一起在走廊里转动轮椅往前走，在大喊大笑。某种隐藏在未来的恐怖之事被略过了，没有发生。一切顺利，不再有疼痛，他生命里最微末的细节都暴露出来，他被理解并被原谅了。

他在木板床上挣着，不太肯定他是否听到了奥布兰的声音。整个审讯过程中，虽然从未看到过他，但温斯顿有种感觉，奥布兰就在旁边，只是他看不见而已。是奥布兰在操纵一切，是他派来看守殴打温斯顿，又不让他们把他打死。是他决定温斯顿什么时候应该痛得尖叫，什么时候让他的痛苦暂缓，什么时候该给他东西吃，什么时候让他睡觉，什么时候把药物注射进他的胳膊，是他提问并提示问题的答案。他是折磨者，保护者，审讯者，也是朋友。有一次——温斯顿不知道自己是处于药物作用下的睡眠中还是在正常的睡眠中，要么甚至在没有睡着时——有个声音在他耳边低语：“别担心，温斯顿，有我照顾你。我观察你已经七年了，现在到了转折点。我会拯救你，我要让你变得完美。”他不肯定那是不是奥布兰的声音，但跟向他说“我们会在没有黑暗的地方见面”的是同样的声音，那是在另一次梦中，七年前的事。

他不记得审讯是怎样结束的。先是一段黑暗期，然后就到了现在所住的牢房或者说房间里，他这时逐渐看清了周围的东西。他几乎完全平躺着，无法移动身体。他身体的每个主要部位都被绑紧了，甚至后脑勺也不知怎样被固定住了。奥布兰在俯视着他，严肃而且相当悲伤。从下往上看，他的脸庞显得粗糙而衰老，眼下有眼袋，从鼻子到下巴有一些劳累留下的皱纹。他比温斯顿想象的还要老，可能有四十五或者五十岁。他的手下面有个控制盘，上面有个控制杆，盘上还有数字。

“我告诉过你，”奥布兰说，“我们再次见面的话，会是在这里。”

“对。”温斯顿说。

没有警告，只是奥布兰的手轻轻一动，一波疼痛感就袭过他的身体。这是种令人恐惧的疼痛，因为他不明白怎么回事，他有种感觉自己的身体正在承受某种致命的伤害。他不知道他是否真的在承受那种伤害，也不知道那种效果是否由电流造成，但他的身体扭曲得变了形，关节正被慢慢扯开。虽然那种疼痛让他的前额冒出汗珠，但最糟糕的是害怕他的脊椎会喀嚓一声扭断。他咬紧牙关，用力通过鼻孔呼吸，试图尽量久地保持沉默。

“你害怕了，”奥布兰看着他的脸说，“害怕再过一会儿什么东西就会断掉，你最害怕的是你的脊骨会扭断。你脑子里有幅生动的图像，就是你的脊椎喀嚓一声断掉，脊髓从里面流出来。这就是你正在想的，对不对，温斯顿？”

温斯顿没回答。奥布兰扭回控制盘上的控制杆，那种疼痛之波去得几乎和来时一样迅速。

“那是四十。”奥布兰说，“你可以看到，这个盘上最高的数字是一百。请你记好了，在我们的全部谈话时间里，我能随心所欲地随时用任何一种级数让你疼痛。你说任何谎话，或者试图以任何方式搪塞我，甚至显得低于你的一般智力水平，你就会马上疼得叫起来。明白吗？”

“明白。”温斯顿说。

奥布兰的举止没那么严肃了，他沉思地推了下眼镜，来回走了几步。再次开口说话时，他的声音既温柔又耐心。他有种医生或是教师，甚至是牧师的样子，苦口婆心地想解释或者说服别人，而不是惩罚。

“我在为你费神，温斯顿。”他说，“因为你值得。你很清楚自己有什么毛病，你已经认识到了好几年，尽管你试过想否认。你精神不正常，有记忆缺失的毛病。你记不住真正的事件，你还说服了自己，认为你记得别的一些从未发生过的事件。幸好你可以被治好。你自己从来没将自己治好，因为你不愿意那样做。你需要在意志上再努力一点，可是你不想那样做。即使到现在，你仍然抱着你的病症不放，自以为那是种德行，我很清楚。现在我们可以举例说明一下。目前，大洋国在跟那个国家打仗？”

“我被捕时，大洋国在跟东亚国打仗。”

“跟东亚国，好。大洋国一直在跟东亚国打仗，对不对？”

温斯顿吸了口气，他张口想说话，却没说出来，他没办法不看控制盘。

“请说实话，温斯顿，你的实话。告诉我你自以为记得什么？”

“我记得直到我被捕前一星期，我们根本不是在跟东亚国打仗，而跟他们是盟国。战争是跟欧亚国打的，已经持续四年。在那之前——”

奥布兰用手势制止了他。

“再举个例子吧。”他说，“几年前你有过确实很严重的错觉，以为三个名叫琼斯、艾朗森和鲁瑟福曾经是党员的人——他们在对其罪行完全供认不讳后，因为叛国罪和破坏行为而被处决了——你以为他们没犯下被指控的罪行，你相信你看到了确凿无疑的文件证据，可以证明他们的坦白都是假的。有一张让你产生了幻觉的照片，你以为你真的在手里拿过。那是张像这样的照片。”

奥布兰的手指间拿一片长方形的报纸，在也许有五秒钟时间里，从温斯顿的角度能看到它。是张照片，是哪张照片勿庸置疑，就是那张照片，另外一张琼斯、艾朗森和鲁瑟福在纽约进行党务活动的照片，他在十一年前碰巧看到过，但马上就毁掉了。它在他眼前一晃，然后又看不到了。但是他已经看到，毫无疑问他是看到了！他极度痛苦地拼命想把上身挣脱，可是不管向哪个方向移动一厘米都不可能。他暂时忘记了控制盘。他想做的，只是把那张照片再次拿在手里，或者至少再看一眼。

“它存在的！”温斯顿叫道。

“不。”奥布兰说。

他走到房间里的另一边，对面墙上有个记忆洞。奥布兰掀起盖子，那张薄薄的一片纸没看到就被一股暖气流卷走，在火焰一闪之际消失了。奥布兰从墙那边转过身。

“成灰了，”他说，“甚至不是可以辨认出来的灰，是尘土。它不存在，从来没存在过。”

“可是它存在过！现在也存在！它在记忆里存在。我记得，你也记得。”

“我不记得。”奥布兰说。

温斯顿的心沉了下去。这就是双重思想，他有了种彻底无助的感觉。如果他能肯定奥布兰在撒谎，那就似乎有其重要性，但完全有可能奥布兰真的忘了那张照片。真能如此，那么他也会忘记他否认过记得那张照片，然后又忘记忘记这一行为本身。你怎么能肯定这仅仅是个花招而已？也许大脑的疯狂混乱状态真的有可能发生，正是这个想法打败了温斯顿。

奥布兰在沉思着低头看他。更有甚于以往，他有了种教师的样子，正在不辞辛苦地教一个任性但仍有希望的孩子。

“党的标语中有一条关于对过去的控制，”他说，“可以的话，请为我重复一下。”

“‘谁掌握历史，谁就掌握未来。’”温斯顿顺从地重复道。

“‘谁掌握历史，谁就掌握未来。’”奥布兰点着头说，算是终于表示了认可。“温斯顿，依你看来，过去是真实存在的吗？”

无助感再次笼罩了温斯顿。他用眼睛扫了一眼控制盘，他不知道“是”或者“不是”这两种回答哪种能让他免遭疼痛之苦，甚至也不知道哪种回答他相信是正确的。

奥布兰微微笑了。“你可根本不是什么玄学家，温斯顿。”他说，“直到这会儿，你从来没有考虑过存在意味着什么。我说得更准确一点吧。过去是有形地存在于空间中吗？有没有另外一个地方，一个由实物构成的世界，在那里，过去仍在进行中？”

“没有。”

“过去存在的话，会存在于哪里？”

“档案里，那是书面的。”

“档案里，还有呢？”

“脑子里，在人们的记忆里。”

“在记忆里，说得很好。可是我们，也就是党，控制所有的档案，我们也控制所有的记忆，因此我们控制过去，对不对？”

“可是你们怎么能阻止人们记东西？”温斯顿叫道，他再次暂时忘了控制盘。“那是不由自主的，个人控制不了的。你怎么能控制记忆？你还没能控制我的记忆呢！”

奥布兰的态度再次变得严厉。他把手放在控制盘上。

“恰恰相反，”他说，“是你没能控制住它，所以让你到了这儿。你之所以到了这儿，是因为你在谦恭和自律上做得不够，没能做到服从，这是理智的代价。你宁愿当个疯子，当一个人的少数派。只有受过训练的头脑才能看到现实，温斯顿。你相信现实是客观和外在的东西，是独立存在的，你也相信现实的本质不言自明。当你让自己迷惑，以为自己看到什么东西时，你设想每个人都像你一样看到了。不过我告诉你，温斯顿，现实不是外在的。现实存在于人们的头脑中，而不是在别的地方。它不在个人的头脑里，个人的头脑会犯错，而且无论如何，很快就会消亡。现实仅仅存在于党的头脑里，那是集体性的，也是不朽的。无论如何，只要党认为对，它就是对的。除非从党的观点来看，否则不能看到现实。温斯顿，你必须重新学习，这就是事实。它需要自毁行为和意志上的努力。你一定要让自己变得谦恭，然后才能变得理智。”

他停顿了一阵子，好像是让他所说的被领会。

“你记得吗，”他又说道，“你在日记里写过‘自由就是说二加二等于四的自由’？”

“记得。”温斯顿说。

奥布兰举起左手，手背对着温斯顿，拇指藏着，伸出四根指头。

“我伸出的是几根手指，温斯顿？”

“四根。”

“如果党说不是四根而是五根——那么是几根？”

“四根。”

说出这个词后他马上痛苦地抽了一口气，控制盘的指针一下子跳到了四十五。温斯顿猛地出了一身汗。他使劲吸着气，呼出来时，是低沉的呻吟声，即使牙关紧咬也控制不住。奥布兰看着他，仍然伸着四根手指。他把控制杆又复了位，这一次，疼痛只是稍微减轻了些。

“几根手指，温斯顿？”

“四根。”

指针达到了六十。

“几根手指，温斯顿？”

“四根！四根！还用说吗？四根！”

指针一定是更高了些，但他没看到，他看到的，只是那张阴沉严厉的脸庞和四根手指。几根手指柱子一样矗立在他眼前，巨大而模糊，好像在摇晃着，但无疑是四根。

“几根手指，温斯顿？”

“四根！停下来，停下来！你怎么能不停下来？四根！四根！”

“几根手指，温斯顿？”

“五根！五根！五根！”

“不，温斯顿，这样没用。你在撒谎，你还在想着有四根。请你说有几根手指？”

“四根！五根！四根！你想是几根就是几根，可是停下来吧，别让我受罪了！”

突然，他靠着奥布兰搭在他肩膀上的手臂想坐起来。他也许有几秒钟昏了过去，绑着他的绳子松开了。他感到很冷，在控制不住地颤抖，牙齿咬得咔嗒咔嗒响，眼泪在顺着脸颊往下流。有那么一阵子，他像个婴儿似的抱紧了奥布兰，奇怪的是，那双抱着他肩膀的粗壮手臂给了他安慰。他有种感觉，奥布兰是他的保护者，疼痛是外来的，来自别人，而奥布兰会让他免受疼痛。

“你学得很慢，温斯顿。”奥布兰和蔼地说。

“我能怎么办？”他哭哭啼啼地说，“我怎么会看不到在我眼前的东西？二加二等于四。”

“有时候是，温斯顿。有时候二加二等于五，有时候等于三，有时候三种答案都对。你一定要再努力一点，变得理智是不容易的。”

他把温斯顿放回床上，温斯顿的四肢又被绑紧，但疼痛感已经退去，他也不再颤抖了，只剩下虚弱和冰冷的感觉。奥布兰向那个身穿白大褂的人点头示意，那人在整个过程中一动不动地站着。白大褂弯下身子仔细检查了他的眼睛，摸了摸他的脉搏，耳朵贴在他心口听，到处敲了敲，然后向奥布兰点点头。

“再来。”奥布兰说。

疼痛掠过温斯顿的身体，指针一定到了七十或者七十五。这次他闭上了眼睛。他知道手指还在那里，还是四个。唯一重要的是不管怎样不能死，要坚持到疼痛结束。他不再留意自己哭了还是没哭。疼痛又减轻了一些。他睁开眼睛，奥布兰把控制杆又复了位。

“几根手指，温斯顿？”

“四根，我想是四根，我能看到五根就会看到五根了。我正在努力看到五根。”

“你希望的是什么，说服我你看到五根还是真的看到五根？”

“真的看到五根。”

“再来。”奥布兰说。

也许指针到了九十五，温斯顿只是断断续续记得为何会感到疼痛。他紧紧闭上眼睛之后，一片手指的森林跳舞般动来动去，时而交织，时而分开，一根遮挡着另一根，接着又重新显露出来。他在试图数数那是多少，不记得为什么要数，只知道不可能数清，而不知何故，那是由于四和五之间的神秘特性。疼痛又消失了，他再次睁开眼睛时，发现自己仍在看着同样的东西：数不清的手指就像移动的树木，正向两个方向不断掠过，交叉，分开。他又闭上眼睛。

“我伸着几根手指，温斯顿？”

“我不知道，我不知道。你再那么做我要死了。四根，五根，六根——一丝一毫也不骗你，我不知道。”

“有进步。”奥布兰说。

一个针头刺进温斯顿的手臂，几乎就在同时，一种令人极其愉快、能令人康复的温暖感扩展到了他的全身，疼痛几乎已经忘了一半。他睁开眼睛感激地看着奥布兰，看着那张阴沉而有皱纹的脸——非常丑陋，但又非常聪明——他心如潮翻。如果他能够活动身体，他会伸出一只手搭在奥布兰的胳膊上。他从来没有像此时这样，真挚地爱着奥布兰，原因不仅是奥布兰让他不再疼痛。那种旧感觉又回来了，就是说到底，奥布兰是朋友还是敌人无关紧要，重要的是他是个可以与之交谈的人。也许和被人爱比起来，人们更想要的是被理解。奥布兰把他折磨得快疯了，要不了多久，肯定会把他送上死路，但那无关紧要。从某种意义上说，那种感情比友谊还要深厚，他们是至交。总存在那么一个地方，让他们可以面对面交谈，虽然真正要说什么话可能永远也不会说出。奥布兰在俯视着他，那种表情说明在他自己心里，可能有着同样的想法。他开口时，是种平易近人的谈话式语气。

“你知不知道你现在在哪里，温斯顿？”他问道。

“我不知道，不过我猜得到，是在仁爱部。”

“你知不知道你到这儿多长时间了？”

“我不知道，几天，几星期，几个月——我觉得有几个月。”

“在你看来，我们为什么把人带到这儿来呢？”

“让他们坦白。”

“不对，不是那个原因。再想想看。”

“惩罚他们。”

“不对！”奥布兰大叫一声。他的声音变化很大，他的脸庞突然变得既严厉又表情生动。“不对！不仅仅是为了掏出他们的供词，也不仅仅是为了惩罚你。我告诉你我们为什么把你带到这儿好吗？为了治愈你！让你变得理智！我们带到这里的每个人没有谁在离开时还没被治好，你明白吗，温斯顿？我们对你犯的那些愚蠢的罪行不感兴趣。党对公然的行为不感兴趣，我们关心的只是思想。我们不只是消灭敌人，我们还把他们改变过来。你明白我这句话的含义吗？”

他向温斯顿弯着身子。距离近的关系，他的脸庞看来其大无比，而且极为丑陋，因为是从下往上看到的。除此之外，这张脸上还洋溢着得意和狂热。温斯顿的心再次抽紧了。如果可能，他会在床上再往下缩一些。他很有把握觉得奥布兰正要完全是随心所欲地扭动指针。但就在此时，奥布兰转过身子，来回走了几步，然后以没那么激动的语气继续说道：

“你首先要明白的是，在这里，没有烈士这个概念。你读到过以前的宗教迫害。中世纪有过宗教裁判所，那是失败之举。它以铲除异教为目标，结果却让异教永远扎下了根。在火刑柱上烧死一个异教徒，会有几千别的人站出来。怎么会这样？因为宗教裁判所公开把敌人杀死，是在他们还没有悔悟的情况下，就把他们杀掉的，实际上，他们是因为不肯悔悟而被杀掉。他们之所以被杀，是因为他们不肯放弃他们真正的信念。自然，所有光荣都归于受害者，所有耻辱都归于把他们烧死的人。到后来，二十世纪出现了所谓的极权主义者。他们是德国纳粹和俄国的共产党。俄国人对异端的迫害比宗教裁判所还要残酷。他们想象自己已经从过去的失误中吸取了教训，至少知道不能制造烈士。在对受害者进行公审时，决意摧毁他们的尊严。他们拷打和单独关押击垮受害者，直到受害者变成人所不齿、畏畏缩缩的无耻之徒，让他们坦白什么就坦白什么，把自己骂得狗血淋头，互相指责，拿别人当替罪羊，呜咽着请求原谅。然而仅仅几年后，同样的事情再次发生了。死去的人成了烈士，他们曾经名誉扫地，也被忘记了。还是那个问题，怎么会这样？首先，因为他们坦白的显然是逼供出来的，不真实。我们不会犯下这种错误。在这里，所有坦白都是真实的，我们让它是真实的。最重要的是，我们不允许死人再还魂反对我们。你一定别再想象后世会为你平反，温斯顿。后世会从来不曾听说过你，你会被从历史的河流中完全剔除出去。我们会把你变成气体，把你注入平流层。你一丁点儿也不会留下，档案里不会有你的名字，活人的脑子里也没有一点关于你的记忆。你在过去和未来的意义上都将被毁灭，你将永远不曾存在过。”

那干吗要费事来折磨我？温斯顿想，一时感到痛苦。奥布兰停下脚步，就好像温斯顿把这个想法大声说了出来。他那张大而丑陋的脸庞又凑近一些，眼睛略微眯了起来。

“你在想，”他说，“既然我们有意彻底毁灭你，所以你所说或者所做的不会有任何作用——既然如此，我们干吗要费事先审讯你？你想的就是这个，对不对？”

“对。”温斯顿说。

奥布兰微微一笑。“你是图案上的一个瑕疵，温斯顿，你是个必须清除的污点。我刚才有没有跟你说过，我们和过去的迫害者不一样？我们不满足于负面的服从，即使对最奴性的服从也不满足。最后当你向我们屈服时，一定是出于你自己的意志。我们不是因为异端分子反抗我们而消灭他，而是只要他反抗我们，我们就从不消灭他。我们改变他，掌握他的头脑并重塑他，把他的罪恶和所有幻想都从他的头脑中除去。我们把他争取过来，不是在外表上，而是实实在在、全心全意的，在处死他之前，我们把他变成自己人。对我们来说，不可忍受的是世界上存在一个错误的念头，不管它是多么秘密和无力。即使在处死一个人时，我们也不允许他有任何离经叛道之处。过去，异教徒在走向火刑柱时，仍然是个异教徒，同时还在宣扬他的异端邪说并为之得意。即使那些俄国大清洗中的受害者，在他们走过过道等着挨子弹时，他的脑袋里仍然有反抗思想。但是我们在把大脑崩掉之前，先要让它变得完美。旧专制主义者的命令是‘你们不许怎么样’，极权主义者的命令是‘你们要怎么样’，而我们的命令是‘你们是怎么样’。我们带到这里的人再也没有一个跟我们为敌，每个人都洗干净了。就连那三个你相信他们是无辜的可怜的叛国者——琼斯、艾朗森和鲁瑟福——到最后也被我们击垮了。我参加了审讯工作，我看到他们一步步垮掉，呜咽着，在地上爬，哭——到最后他们有的不是痛苦或恐惧，而是悔悟之心。到我们结束对他们的审讯后，他们只是徒具人形。除了对他们所犯之事感到悔恨和对老大哥的热爱，别无其他，看到他们那么热爱老大哥，我真受感动。他们恳求尽快被枪决，以便死时他们的思想仍然干净。”

他的声音变得几乎像是梦呓一般，那种兴奋和狂热之情仍然挂在他脸上。温斯顿想，他没有装扮，他不是个虚伪的人，他相信他所说的每一个字。最折磨温斯顿的，是他意识到自己在智力上不如他。他看着那具巨大然而优雅的躯体踱来踱去，一会儿出现在他的视野里，一会儿不在。奥布兰哪方面都比他强，他有过或者可能会有的想法没有一样不是奥布兰早就想到、思考并摈弃过的。他的头脑包容了温斯顿的。但既然如此，奥布兰又怎么会是疯狂的呢？一定是他，温斯顿，才是疯狂的。奥布兰停下脚步俯视着他，他的声音再次变得严厉。

“温斯顿，不管你向我们屈服得多彻底，你都别心存可以活命的妄想。走入歧途的人没有一个会被放过，就算我们决定让你尽享天年，你还是跑不出我们的手心。现在发生在你身上的事将永远抹不掉，你得先理解这一点。我们会把你收拾得永世不得翻身，就算你活上一千年，将要发生在你身上的事还会让你永远无法忘记。你永远不会再有普通人的情感，你内心的一切全会死掉，你永远无力再拥有爱、友谊，或者生的欢乐、好奇心、勇气或正直心。你将是空心的，我们把你挤空了，然后用我们自己把你填满。”

他停下来向那个白大褂示意。温斯顿意识到某种很沉重的器械在他脑袋后面被推到位。奥布兰在床边坐了下来，那让他的脸庞和温斯顿的处于同等高度。

“三千。”他向站在温斯顿头后面的那个白大褂说。

两个感觉稍微有点湿的软垫夹着温斯顿的太阳穴。他感到恐惧，感到了疼痛，这是种新的疼痛。奥布兰用一只手抚慰地，也几乎是慈祥地把手放在温斯顿的手里。

“这次不会疼。”他说，“盯住我眼睛。”

就在此时，有了一声毁灭性的爆炸，或者说好像是爆炸，不过也说不准是否真的有什么声音。但无疑有过一道眩目的光亮。温斯顿没感觉到疼痛，只是被放平了。虽然在发生之际，他也在仰面躺着，但他有种被打到那个位置的奇怪感觉。没有痛感的可怕一击把他打得平躺着了。他的脑子也受到了某种影响。他眼睛重新能看清东西时，他记起了自己是谁，身处哪里，也认出了正盯着他看的那张脸，但在某个地方，有块很大的空白，似乎他的脑子被取走了一块。

“很快就不疼了。”奥布兰说，“看着我的眼睛。大洋国正在跟哪个国家打仗？”

温斯顿想了想。他知道大洋国是什么意思，他自己就是大洋国的公民。他也记得欧亚国和东亚国，然而不知道谁跟谁在打仗，事实上，他意识不到有什么战争。

“我想不起来了。”

“大洋国在跟东亚国打仗，现在你想起来了吧？”

“对。”

“大洋国一直在跟东亚国打仗。从你出生开始，从建党开始，从有史可查以来，战争一直没间断地进行着，一直是同一场战争。你想起来了吗？”

“对。”

“十一年前，你编造了一个关于三个因为叛国罪被判处死刑之人的传奇故事。你自以为看到了能证明他们无辜的一片报纸。但是不存在这样一片报纸，是你虚构出来的，后来你就越来越信以为真。你现在还记得你第一次虚构的那一刻，记得吗？”

“对。”

“刚才我向你举起我的手指，你看到了五根手指，记得吗？”

“对。”

奥布兰举起左手伸出手指，只是把拇指弯了起来。

“这儿是五根手指，你看到五根手指吗？”

“对。”

有那么一瞬间，在他头脑里的景象变化之前，他确实看到了。他看到五根手指，每根都伸直着。然后一切都又恢复正常，那种过去有过的恐惧、仇恨和困惑再次纷至沓来。但是有那么一刻——他不知道有多久，也许有半分钟——是清清楚楚、很有把握的一刻。在那时，奥布兰的每个新暗示都填充了那块空白，成为绝对的真实。在那时，二加二很容易可以根据需要等于五，也可以等于三。那一刻在奥布兰把手拿开之前就已经结束。虽然他无法再次体验那一刻，但他仍然记得，如同一个人会生动地记得许多年前的一次经历，而当时他其实是另外一个不同的人。

“你现在看到了，”奥布兰说，“不管怎么样那是可能的。”

“对。”温斯顿说。

奥布兰带着满足的神情站了起来。在他左边，温斯顿看到那个白大褂打破一支针剂，抽了一针管药。奥布兰面带笑容地转向温斯顿，几乎跟以前一样，他推了一下鼻子上的眼镜。

“你在日记中写过，”他说，“不管我是朋友还是敌人都没关系，因为我至少是个能理解你、可以跟你交谈的人，还记得吗？你写得没错，我喜欢跟你谈话。你的头脑让我感兴趣，跟我的类似，只不过你刚好是精神失常的。我们结束这节谈话之前，你想的话，可以问我一些问题。”

“问什么都可以？”

“任何问题，”他看到温斯顿的眼睛在看控制盘。“已经关掉了。你想先问什么？”

“你们把茱莉娅怎么样了？”

奥布兰又微笑起来。“她背叛了你，温斯顿，马上而且彻底，我还从来没见到有谁那么快就投向我们。你见到她的话会几乎认不出她。她的反叛性、欺骗性、愚蠢、肮脏思想——一切从她身心里消除干净了，是种完美的转变，教科书式的。”

“你拷打过她吗？”

奥布兰避而不答。“下个问题。”他说。

“老大哥存在吗？”

“他当然存在，党也存在，老大哥是党的体现。”

“他像我一样存在吗？”

“你不存在。”奥布兰说道。

那种无助感再次向他袭来。他知道，或者说他能想象到证明他不存在的理由，但都是胡说八道，是文字游戏。像“你是不存在的”这句话，难道没有包含一种逻辑上的荒谬之处？不过这样说又有什么用处？想到奥布兰可能用以把他驳得一败涂地的那些疯狂理由，他的头脑陷入枯竭。

“我想我是存在的，”他有气无力地说，“我意识到自己的身份。我出生，我将死去，有胳膊有腿，在宇宙中占据一个特定的位置，没有另外一个固体跟我同时占据同一个位置。在这种意义上，老大哥存在吗？”

“这无关紧要，他存在。”

“老大哥会死吗？”

“当然不会，他怎么会死呢？下个问题。”

“兄弟会存在吗？”

“这个嘛，温斯顿，你永远也不会知道。就算我们把你审完后决定释放你，就算你活上九十岁，你仍然永远不会知道这个问题的答案是‘对’还是‘不对’。只要你活着，它就是你脑子里的不解之谜。”

温斯顿不说话躺在那儿，他的呼吸急促了一些。他还是没有问他最先想到的那个问题。一定要问，但好像他的嘴巴说不出话。

奥布兰的脸上有一丝开心的样子，连他的眼镜也似乎闪着嘲弄的光芒。他知道，温斯顿突然想，他知道我要问什么！想到这里，他脱口而出：

“一零一房间里有什么？”

奥布兰脸上的表情仍然没变，他冷冷地说：

“你知道一零一房间里有什么，温斯顿。谁都知道一零一房间里有什么。”

他向白大褂举起一根手指，显然这节谈话到此为止。一个针头突然刺进温斯顿的手臂，他几乎马上就沉沉睡去。





第三章


“你的改造分三个阶段。”奥布兰说，“也就是学习、理解和接受。现在你该进入第二阶段了。”

跟往常一样，温斯顿脸朝上平躺着。最近，他被绑得没那么紧了，虽然仍被绑在床上，但是能够活动一点膝部，头能往两侧转动，还能抬起小臂。控制盘也没那么可怕了，如果他够机智，就能免受那种巨痛：主要在他表现得愚蠢时，奥布兰才会扳动控制杆，有时在他们整整一节谈话里，控制盘一次也没用上。他不记得他们进行过多少节谈话，整个过程似乎难以确定地拖长了——可能有几个星期——而两次的间隔有时可能是几天，有时只有一两个小时。

“你躺着时，”奥布兰说，“经常在琢磨——你甚至问过我——为什么仁爱部会在你身上这样费时费神，你被释放后，还会感到困惑，基本上是为了同一个问题。你能理解你在其中生活的社会机制，可你不理解根本的动机。你记不记得你在日记本上写过‘我明白怎么做，但是我不明白为什么’？你就是在想到‘为什么’时，怀疑起自己是否神志清楚。你已经读过‘那本书’，戈斯坦因的书，或者说至少已经读了一部分。它有没有告诉你以前不知道的东西？”

“你读过吗？”

“我写的，也就是说我参与了写作。你也知道，没有哪本书能由一个人写出来。”

“它说的对不对？”

“作为说明是对的，它列出的计划则是胡扯。秘密积累起知识——逐渐扩大启蒙的范围——最终导致群众起来造反——推翻党的统治。你也能料到会怎样写，全是胡扯。群众永远不会造反，再过成千上万年也不会，他们没能力。我没必要告诉你为什么，因为你已经知道了。如果你怀有什么暴动的梦想，最好还是放弃吧。党是无法被推翻的，党的统治永永远远，把这个当做思考的出发点吧。”

他向床又走近了一些。“永永远远！”他重复道，“现在让我们回到那个‘怎么做’和‘为什么’的问题上。你理解得很透彻，党是怎么来保证掌权的。现在你告诉我为什么我们要抓住权力不放。我们的动机是什么？为什么想掌权？说吧。”温斯顿不说话，他又加上一句。

但温斯顿还是有一阵子没说活，一阵疲劳感汹涌而来。奥布兰的脸上又隐约现出那种狂热神情，他提前就知道奥布兰会说什么话，那就是党要掌权并非为了自身，而是为了多数人的利益。它要掌权，是因为人民大众是意志薄弱的胆怯之徒，不能忍受自由或者面对事实，一定要被另外那些比他们更坚强的人统治和有系统地欺骗。人类有两种选择，即自由和幸福，对大多数人而言，选择幸福较好。还有党永远是弱者的保护人，是具有献身精神的一群人，为了美好的未来能够来到而做罪恶之事，为了他人的幸福而牺牲了自己的幸福。可怕的是，温斯顿想，可怕的是奥布兰说这些话时，他在内心里也相信，这点从他脸上看得出。奥布兰无所不知，比温斯顿对世事真相的理解要超过一千倍，也就是大批人的生活有多么潦倒不堪，以及党为了让他们保持那样，采用什么样的谎言和暴行。他全都明白，全都盘算过，不过这无关紧要，一切因为最终目的而正当化了。温斯顿想，你又能拿一个比你更聪明的疯子怎么样？他可以充分聆听你的论点，却只是守着他的疯狂不放。

“你们是为了我们的利益而统治我们，”他有气无力地说，“你们相信人类不适于自己管理自己，所以——”

他刚开口就几乎大叫起来。一阵巨痛穿透了他的身体，奥布兰把控制盘上的控制杆扳到三十五的位置。

“那是蠢话，温斯顿，愚蠢！”他说，“你明白你不该说这种话！”

他把扳手扳回来又继续说道：

“现在让我告诉你这个问题的答案，是这样的：党要掌权，完全是为了自身利益，我们对他人的幸福不感兴趣，只对权力感兴趣。不是财富、奢侈生活、长寿或者幸福，只是权力，纯粹的权力。什么是纯粹的权力，你很快就会明白。我们跟过去所有的寡头统治者都不一样，区别在于我们知道自己在做什么。所有其他人，甚至跟我们类似的人，都是懦夫和伪善者。德国纳粹和俄国共产党在统治手段上很相似，但他们永远没勇气承认自己的手段。他们伪称——也许甚至还相信——他们是不情愿地取得了有限时间内的权力，在不远的将来，会有一个天堂社会，到那时，人人自由平等。我们和他们不一样，我们知道从来不曾有谁取得权力是为了放弃。权力不是手段，而是目的。人们不会为了保卫革命而建立独裁政权。迫害的目的就是迫害，权力的目的就是权力。你现在开始明白我的话了吗？”

正如以前曾经有过的，温斯顿被奥布兰脸上的疲态打动了。这张脸是坚强的，易于感动的，然而又是残酷的，它充满了智慧，还有种克制的热情，在这张脸面前，他感到自己是无助的，但那是张疲惫的脸，有眼袋，颧骨下面的皮肤松驰着。奥布兰向他侧过身，有意把那张疲态尽现的脸凑近他。

“你在想，”他说，“你在想我的脸又老又疲惫，你在想，我一方面谈论权力，另一方面，我甚至挡不住自己身体的衰败。温斯顿，你难道不明白个人只是细胞？有了细胞的疲劳，才有机体的活力。你给自己剪指甲会死吗？”

他从床那里转身走开，又开始来回踱起步来，一只手放在口袋里。

“我们是权力的祭司，”他说，“权力是上帝，但目前对你来说，权力只是个单词而已，现在到了该让你掌握一点权力的含义的时候。你必须明白的头一件事，就是权力具有集体性，个人只有在他不成其为个人的情况下才拥有权力。你知道党的标语：‘自由即奴役’。你有没有想到过反过来说也行？奴役即自由。单个的、不受约束的人总会被打败，人们必然受到约束，那是因为每个人必然死去，这是最大的失败。可是如果他能完全彻底服从，如果他能挣脱个体身份的束缚，那么他就无所不能、永生不死。你要明白的第二件事是权力，是对人的权力，建立在身体上——但最重要的，是建立在思想上，对于实体——你会称其为外在的现实——的权力不重要。我们对实体的控制已经是绝对性的。”

有那么一阵子，温斯顿置控制盘于不顾，猛地用力想坐起身子，但只能痛苦地扭动身体而已。

“可你们怎么能控制实体呢？”他脱口而出，“你们甚至控制不了气候或者重力定律，还有疾病、疼痛、死亡——”

奥布兰做了个手势，不让他再住下说。“我们控制实体，是因为我们控制了思想。现实是装在脑袋里的，你会逐步认识到，温斯顿。没有我们办不到的事，隐身、升空——任何事。如果我想像个肥皂泡一样浮离地板，我就能做到，可是我不想这样，因为党不想这样。你一定要清除十九世纪关于自然规律的那些想法，自然规律由我们来制定。”

“可是你们没有！你们甚至不是我们这个行星上的主人。欧亚国和东亚国又怎么样？你们还没征服呢。”

“那不重要，我们会在我们认为合适的时候征服它们。即使我们不去征服，那又有什么关系？我们可以让它们不存在，大洋国就是整个世界。”

“可是世界本身只是一粒灰尘，人类是渺小的——无能为力的！人类才存在多久？在几百万年的时间里，地球上没有人类居住。”

“胡说，地球跟我们人类一样古老，不会更古老。它怎么会更古老呢？除非通过人类的意识来反映，否则一切都不存在。”

“可是石头里都是绝种动物的骨头——是根本没听说过有人类存在之前很久的猛犸、乳齿象还有巨大的爬行动物的骨头。”

“你看到过那些骨头了吗，温斯顿？你当然没有，那是十九世纪考古学家杜撰出来的。有人类之前一无所有，人类之后——如果他会走到终点的话——也将是一无所有。除人类之外，都一无所有。”

“可是整个宇宙都在我们之外。你看那些星星！有些有几百万年光年之远，永远不可能到达。”

“什么是星星？”奥布兰漠不关心地说，“那只是几公里外的火光，我们想的话，就能到达那儿，或者说我们可以抹灭它。地球是宇宙的中心，太阳和星星绕着它转动。”

温斯顿又猛然动了一下，这次他没再说什么。奥布兰像是听到一个说出来的反对意见一样继续说道：

“当然，某些特定情况下并非如此。在大海上航行或者预测日食、月食时，我们经常发现假定地球围绕太阳转、星星在亿万公里之外的地方较为方便，可那又怎么样？你以为我们不可能创造出两套天文学体系吗？星星可以根据我们的需要或远或近，你以为我们的数学家无法胜任？你忘了有双重思想吗？”

温斯顿在床上缩着身子。不管他说什么，张口就来的回答都会像根大头棒一样把他砸倒。但他仍然知道，知道他是对的。关于在你自己的头脑之外什么都不存在的信念——是不是肯定有办法能证明是错的？那不是很久以前已被揭露是个谬论吗？它甚至有个名称，他忘了是什么。奥布兰俯视着他，一丝淡淡的微笑浮现在他嘴角。

“我告诉过你，温斯顿。”他说，“玄学不是你的专长。你想找的词是唯我论，可是你错了。这不是唯我论，你愿意的话，可以称它为集体唯我论。但不是一回事，其实恰恰相反。这些都是题外话，”他又换了语气说，“真正的权力——我们必须日日夜夜奋力争取的权力——不是对物体的权力，而是对人的权力。”他顿了一下，有那么一阵子，他又带上了老师提问一个有希望的学生时的样子。“一个人怎样对另一个人实施权力，温斯顿？”

温斯顿想了一下。“通过让他受折磨。”他说。

“完全正确，通过让他受折磨。服从还不够，除非他在受折磨，否则你怎么能肯定他服从的是你的意志，而不是他自己的意志？权力就在于对别人施加痛楚和屈辱。权力就是把人们的头脑撕成碎片，然后再按照你自己的决定拼成新的形状。你有没有开始明白我们正在创造什么样的世界？它跟先前的改革家设想过的愚蠢的、享乐主义的乌托邦刚好对立，它是个恐惧、背叛和痛苦的世界，是个践踏和被践踏的世界，是个随着自身的完善变得不是没那么残忍，而是更加残忍的世界。我们这个世界的进步将是向更多痛苦发展的进步。旧文明声称自身建立于仁爱或者公平的基础上，我们的文明，则建立在仇恨上。我们这个世界上，除了恐惧、愤怒、狂喜和自贬，没有别的情感。我们会摧毁一切情感。我们已经在打破革命以前遗留下来的思想习惯。我们切断了孩子和父母之间、男人之间和男女之间的联系纽带，没有人再敢信任妻子、孩子或者朋友了，不过将来也不会有妻子和朋友。孩子刚生下来就从母亲身边带走，如同从母鸡身边拿走鸡蛋一样。性本能将被根除，生育将是一年一度的例行手续，就像更新一个配额卡。我们将消灭性高潮，我们的神经学者现在正进行研究。除了对党的忠诚，不会有别的忠诚，除了对老大哥的爱，不会有别的爱，除了因为打败敌人而笑，不会有别的笑。不会有艺术、文学或者科学。在我们是全能的情况下，就不再需要科学了。美和丑之间不再有区别，不会再有好奇心和生命进程中的乐趣，所有其他类型的快乐将被摧毁。但是始终——一定别忘了这点，温斯顿——始终存在着对权力的陶醉感，始终呈增强之势，始终在变得更为敏感。每时每刻，始终有对胜利的兴奋和践踏一个无力抵抗之人时的激动之情。你如果愿意想象一下未来是什么样，就设想一下皮靴践踏在一张人脸上的感觉吧——那会是永永远远的。”

他停顿了一下，似乎在期待温斯顿说话。温斯顿又一次试图在床上缩得更紧一些，什么话也说不出，他心里好像结了冰。奥布兰继续说道：

“记着那是永永远远的。永远有脸可供践踏，异端分子以及社会的敌人总是存在的，因此可以一次次打败他们，羞辱他们。从你落到我们手里之后经过的一切——那些都将继续下去，而且还会越来越厉害。侦察，背叛，逮捕，折磨，处决，失踪，这些都永远不会停止。这既是个恐怖的世界，也是个狂欢的世界。党越强大，它的容忍度就越小；反抗越弱，就专制得更严厉。戈斯坦因和他的邪说将继续存在下去，每一天，每一刻，它们会被粉碎、怀疑、嘲笑、唾弃，但总是会存在。我和你在过去七年里演出的这场戏将一遍又一遍、一代又一代演下去，总的形式上越来越微妙。这里总会有异端分子任我们摆布，他会因为疼痛而尖叫，精神崩溃，变得可鄙——到最后他彻底悔悟，从自我中拯救出来，自愿爬到我们的脚前。这就是我们正在建设的世界，温斯顿。这是个一场胜利接着一场胜利，一次凯旋接着一次凯旋的世界，没完没了压迫着权力神经的世界。我看得出，你开始明白那个世界是怎么样的了，但是到最后，你不止理解它就够了，你还会接受它，欢迎它，并成为其中一部分。”

温斯顿恢复得有气力说话了。“你们做不到。”他虚弱地说。

“你这话什么意思，温斯顿？”

“你们无法创造一个你刚才描述的世界，是做梦，不可能。”

“为什么呢？”

“因为不可能以恐惧、仇恨和残酷为基础建立一种文明，它永远不会支持很久。”

“为什么不可能？”

“它不会有活力，会解体，会自行毁灭。”

“胡说。你的印象是仇恨比爱更有消耗性，怎么会呢？即便如此，那又有什么关系？假设我们决定让自己衰老得更快，假设我们调快人类生命的速度，到三十岁时就已衰老，还是同样的问题，那又有什么关系？你难道不明白个体的死亡不是死亡吗？党是不朽的。”

同样，这个声音再次把温斯顿打击得有了种无助的感觉。再者，他害怕如果他坚持不同意，奥布兰会再次扳动控制盘，然而他无法保持沉默。他有气无力地又开始反击，不是争辨，除了对于奥布兰所说的怀有说不出的极端厌恶，支撑他的别无其他。

“我不知道——我不管。不管怎么样，你们会失败，某种东西会击败你们，生命会击败你们。”

“我们控制生命，温斯顿，在所有层次上都是。你在想象有种所谓人性的东西，它会被我们的所作所为激怒，因此会反抗我们，不过是我们创造的人性。人具有无限可塑性，如果你是回到你的旧想法上，认为群众或者奴隶会起来推翻我们，那你最好还是忘了那个想法吧，他们是无能为力的，就像动物。人性就是党，其他都是外在的——不相干。”

“我不管，到最后他们会打败你们。或早或晚，他们会看清你们的真面目，然后就会把你们撕成碎片。”

“你看到过有证据表明正在发生那种情况吗？或者任何会是这样的理由？”

“不，我相信如此。我知道你们会失败，宇宙中有某种东西——某种精神或者某种法则，我不知道——你们永远不能战胜。”

“你相信上帝吗，温斯顿？”

“不。”

“那么会是什么，这种会打败我们的法则是什么？”

“我不知道，是人类的精神吧。”

“你觉得自己算是个人吗？”

“对。”

“温斯顿，你是人的话，那你就是最后一个。可是你这种人已经绝种，我们是继承者。你明白你是独一无二的吗？你在历史之外，你不存在。”他的举止改变了，语气也更加严厉，“因为我们说谎而且残酷，你就自以为在道德上高出我们一等？”

“对，我认为自己要高一等。”

奥布兰没有说话。这时听到有两个声音在说话，过了一会儿，温斯顿辨认出其中一个声音是自己的，那是他报名加入兄弟会那天晚上与奥布兰交谈的录音，他听到自己保证会撒谎、偷盗、造假、杀人、唆使吸毒及卖淫、传播性病、向小孩脸上泼硫酸，等等。奥布兰做了个不耐烦的动作，似乎这番演示几乎不值得。他转动一个钮，那声音就停止了。

“你起身下床吧。”他说。

他身上的束缚自动松开了，温斯顿自己下了床在地板上摇摇晃晃地站着。

“你是最后一个人，”奥布兰说，“你是人类精神的守护者，你会看到自己的真实模样。把衣服脱掉。”

温斯顿解开把工作服连在一起的细带子，拉链扣早被扯掉了。他不记得从被捕以来，他有没有脱过一次衣服。工作服下面，他身上套着肮脏的、颜色有点发黄的破布，勉强还能认出那是残存的内衣。把衣服脱到地上后，他看到房间那头有个分为三面的镜子。他向那面镜子走去，接着突然停下脚步，不由自主大哭起来。

“再往前走，”奥布兰说，“站在镜子边上，就能看到侧面的样子。”

他停下脚步是因为他被吓坏了。一个驼背、颜色苍白、貌似骷髅的物体正向他走来，让他感觉恐惧的，是它的实际外表，而不单是知道那就是他自己这一事实。他又向着玻璃镜走近了一些，那个怪物的脸部好像向前突出，是因为它弯着腰的姿势所造成。那是一张绝望的囚犯的脸，有着和秃顶连成一片的宽阔前额、鹰钩鼻子和似乎被击打过的颧骨，颧骨之上是一双凶狠而警觉的眼睛。脸颊上布满皱纹，嘴巴有种凹进去的样子。这无疑是他自己的脸，但在他看来，他的脸跟内心比起来改变得更多，表现出来的情感跟他所感到的不一样。他已经部分秃顶。他一开始以为自己已经变得颜色苍白，但只不过是他的头皮变成了苍白色。除了手和脸部，他浑身上下一片苍白，积着陈垢，灰垢下面还有处处皆有的红色疤痕。脚脖附近的静脉曲张溃疡处红肿了一大片，皮肤正在掉碎屑。但真正可怕的，是他身体的消瘦程度：他的肋骨腔窄小得像是骷髅身上的，腿上瘦缩得以至于膝部比大腿还粗。这时他也明白了奥布兰让他看看侧面是什么意思。他脊椎的弯曲度触目惊心，他瘦削的肩膀往前耸着，好保持有胸腔，只剩骨头的脖子在头颅的重量之下似乎在对折着。如果让他猜，他会认为这是个六十岁男人的身体，而且患上了某种不治之症。

“你有时候想过，”奥布兰说，“想过我的脸——内党党员的脸——看上去既老又疲惫。你觉得自己的脸又怎么样呢？”

他抓住温斯顿的肩膀把他扭过来好正对着自己。

“看看你现在的样子！”他说，“看看你全身的肮脏样子，看看你脚趾缝里的灰尘，看看你腿上让人恶心的溃疡。你知不知道你身上臭得像头山羊？也许你已经不再注意了。看看你这副瘦样子，看到了吗？我一只手就能捏住你的胳膊，能把它像根红萝卜一样扭断。你知不知道从你落到我们手里以来，你的体重下降了二十五公斤？就连你的头发也在一把把往下掉，你看！”他在温斯顿的头上一揪揪下了一把。“张开你的嘴巴，九，十，十一，还剩下十一颗牙齿。你到这里时有多少颗？就连你剩下的这几颗也快掉了。你看！”

他用有力的拇指和食指抓住温斯顿剩下的一颗门牙，温斯顿的颌部掠过一阵刺心的疼痛，奥布兰把那颗松动的牙齿连根拔掉并把它扔到了牢房的那头。

“你正在烂掉，”他说，“正在散架。你算什么？一袋垃圾而已。现在转过去再看看镜子，你看到和你面对面的东西吗？那是最后一个人。如果你是人类，那就是人性。现在再把衣服穿上。”

温斯顿开始用缓慢而僵硬的动作穿上衣服。直至现在，他好像仍未留意到自己有多么削瘦和虚弱。他心里只有一个念头：他在这里一定待得比他想象的还要久。他把那些肮脏的破布裹上身时，陷入了对自己被毁掉的身体的怜悯感。他还没明白自己在干什么，就跌坐在床边一张小凳子上，眼泪夺眶而出。他意识到自己的丑陋和不堪入目，他是穿在肮脏衣服里的一捆骨头，正在刺眼的白色光线下啜泣，可是他无法停下来。奥布兰几乎可以说是仁慈地把一只手搭在他肩膀上。

“不会永远这样的，”他说，“你什么时候决定好了，就什么时候可以避免，一切取决于你。”

“是你干的！”温斯顿呜咽着说，“你把我弄成了这样！”

“不，温斯顿，是你把自己弄成了这样，这是你决心跟党作对时，就已经接受了的，这全包含在第一步行为中。所发生的事情，没有一样是你没有预见到的。”

他停顿了一下，然后继续说道：

“我们把你击败了，温斯顿，我们已经把你打垮了。你已经看到你的身体是什么样子，你的思想处于同样状态，我不认为你还剩下什么自尊心了。你已经被拳打脚踢过，也被辱骂过，你因为疼痛而尖叫过，在地板上自己的血迹和呕吐物中翻滚过，哀求饶恕过，背叛了所有人、所有事。你还能想起哪一样丢脸的事情没做过？”

温斯顿停止了啜泣，不过眼泪仍从他的眼里往外涌。他抬头看着奥布兰。

“我没有背叛茱莉娅。”他说。

奥布兰沉思着俯视温斯顿。“对，”他说，“对，完全正确，你没有背叛茱莉娅。”

温斯顿的心里又涌起对奥布兰的奇特敬意，似乎一切都不能摧毁这种敬意。多么有智慧，他想，多么有智慧啊！没有一次奥布兰不理解向他所说的话，换了世界上别的任何人，都会马上说他已经背叛了茱莉娅，因为在拷打之下，还有什么是他没有坦白过的呢？他告诉过他所知道的关于她的一切：她的习惯、性格和以前的生活，他巨细无遗地坦白了他们每次见面时，所发生的一切，包括他们之间所有的谈话，在黑市上吃的几餐饭，通奸，针对党所订的不清不楚的计划——无所不及。然而从他话里的本意上说，他并未背叛她。他没有停止爱她，对她的感情依然未变。奥布兰不需要解释，就明白了他话里的意思。

“告诉我，”他问道，“他们还有多久会枪毙我？”

“可能要很久，”奥布兰说，“你的情况有点棘手，但是别放弃希望，每个人都或早或晚会被治愈，到最后我们才枪毙你。”





第四章


温斯顿的状况好多了。如果每天这个词还适用，那么他每天都在长胖起来，强壮起来。

白色光线和嗡嗡的声音还是一如既往，但这间牢房比他待过的别的牢房都要舒服一些。木板床上有枕头和床垫，还有张凳子可以坐。他们给他洗了个澡，还允许他较为经常地在一个铁盆里冲洗，甚至还提供冲洗用的热水；他们给了他新内衣和一套干净的工作服，给他静脉曲张的溃疡处抹了镇痛的药膏，把他剩下的牙齿拔掉，并为他新配了假牙。

肯定又过去了几星期或者几个月，现在他有兴趣的话，还是能够计算出时间进程的，因为好像是按照正常间隔给他送饭。据他判断，他每二十四小时吃三顿饭，有时候他会琢磨那几顿饭是白天还是夜里吃的。食物好得让人吃惊，每三顿有一顿能吃到肉，有次甚至给了他一盒香烟。他没有火柴，那个从不说话的看守会为他点个火。第一次吸的时候他感到恶心，不过坚持下来了。这盒烟让他抽了很长时间，每顿饭后抽半根。

他们给了他一个白色的记事板，角上绑了个铅笔头，一开始他没使用。就算醒着，他也完全不想动。他经常在两顿饭的间隔躺在那里，几乎一动不动，有时候在睡觉，有时候会醒着模模糊糊幻想起来，这种时候，睁开眼睛太费事了。他早就习惯了强光照在脸上时仍能睡觉，强光好像无关紧要，只是他所做的梦更有连贯性了。他在这段期间做了很多梦，而且总是愉快的梦。他会在黄金乡，要么他和母亲、茱莉娅以及奥布兰一起，坐在广阔无垠、环境宜人、阳光普照的废墟之间——也没做什么，只是坐在太阳地里聊着家常话。他醒来后所想的绝大部分是关于他做的梦。现在少了疼痛的刺激，他似乎已经失去思维的能力。他并不觉得无聊，不想交谈或者分散一下心思。只是独自待着，不被殴打及审问，有够吃的东西，浑身上下都干净，这完全令人满足。

渐渐地，他在睡觉上花费的时间开始越来越少，不过仍然不想起床。他想做的，只是静静地躺着，感觉体内正在积聚的力量。他会到处摸摸自己，想弄清这不是幻觉，那就是他的肌肉正向着圆滚的方向生长，他的皮肤越来越绷紧了。最后可以确定无疑的是，他正在长胖，他的大腿肯定比膝部粗些了。此后，他开始定期锻练，一开始不大情愿。不久就可以走上三公里，那是通过在牢房里踱步计算出来的。他佝偻的肩膀也挺直了一些。他试图做更复杂的锻练动作，却既震惊又羞愧地发现有些动作他做不到。他只能走，不能跑，不能把凳子平举起来，不能单腿站立，每站必倒；他蹲下去，把体重集中到脚后根上，却发现忍着大腿和腿肚子钻心的巨痛，也只是能站起来而已；他俯卧着试图用双手撑起身体，但一点希望也没有，他甚至无法把自己撑起一厘米高。然而又过了几天后——也就是在又吃了几顿饭后——他连这项壮举也能完成了，后来他一口气就能做六次。在他心里，竟然开始对自己的身体感到自豪，而且时不时还抱有一种信念，即他的脸庞也在长回正常模样。只是当他正好把手放在秃顶的头皮上时，才会想起曾从镜子里望向他的那张布满皱纹、备受摧残的脸庞。

他的头脑变得更活跃了一些。他坐在木板床上，背靠着墙，记事板放在膝盖上，他开始工作了，有意以重新教育自己为任务。

他投降了，在这点上已经达成共识。事实上，现在他也明白了，做出决定之前很久，他就准备好投降了。从到了仁爱部的那一刻——没错，甚至当他和茱莉娅无助地站立着，听着电屏里传来的刺耳声音让他们怎么做的几分钟内——他已经看透他试图以自身对抗党的力量的轻率及肤浅之处。他现在已经知道，思想警察就像透过放大镜看甲虫一样看了他七年整。每一个具体动作，每一句大声讲出来的话都逃脱不了他们的监视，没有一种思绪他们猜不出来。他们甚至把那粒白色灰尘小心放回到日记本上。他们给他放过录音，展示过照片，有几张是茱莉娅跟他自己的合影，对了，甚至还有……他不能再跟党作对，再说党也是对的，必然如此：不朽的、集体的大脑怎么会错呢？你又有什么外在标准来衡量它的判断呢？理智是个统计学概念，只是个学会像他们那样思考的问题。只是——！

他握着铅笔，感觉又粗又不好用。他开始写下想到的东西，首先以笨拙的大写字母写下：



自由即奴役



然后几乎没停顿就又写下：



二加二等于五



接下来却出现了停滞。他的大脑好像在躲避什么，似乎无法集中思想。他知道自己明白接下来是什么，却暂时记不起来。确实记起来时，只是通过有意识的推理，而非自动出现。他写道：



权力即上帝



他接受了一切。过去可以被篡改，过去从未被篡改过。大洋国在跟东亚国打仗，大洋国一直在跟东亚国打仗。琼斯、艾朗森和鲁瑟福犯下了被指控的罪行，他从未见过可以推翻他们罪行的照片，从未存在，是他杜撰出来的。他想起来他记住过相反的事情，但那是错误的记忆，自欺的产物。这全都多么容易啊！只要一投降，其他都顺理成章。如同逆流游泳时，不管你如何用力，水流都把你往回冲，可是突然，你决定顺流而下而非逆流而上。除了你自己的态度，什么都没变化，命里注定的事情总要发生。他几乎不知道他为何反抗过。一切都容易，只是——！

任何事情都可能对，所谓自然规则全是胡扯，重力定律是胡扯。奥布兰说过：“如果我想像个肥皂泡一样浮离地板，我就能做到。”温斯顿琢磨出来了：“如果他认为他浮离地板，而我同时认为我看到他这样做，那么这件事就是发生了。”突然，就像淹没于水下的一大块残骸露出水面那样，一个想法突然浮现在他的脑海：“它不会真的发生，而是我们想象出来的，是幻觉。”他马上压住了这个念头，其谬误之处显而易见。它预先假定在某处，在个体外部存在一个“真实的”世界，其中发生着“真实的”事情。然而又怎么会存在这样一个世界？事情全发生在大脑里，不管是什么，只要在大脑里发生，就真的发生了。

他轻而易举就清除了那个谬见，没有受其诱惑的危险，但他仍然意识到，他永远不该动这种念头。大脑应该在危险思想冒头之际产生一个盲点，这个过程应该是自动的，本能的，在新话里，被称为“止罪”。

他开始锻练自己学习止罪，他向自己提出命题——“党说地球是平坦的”，“党说冰比水重”——然后训练让自己看不到或者理解不了与其矛盾的观点。这并不容易，它需要很强的能力和即时反应。例如，像“二加二等于五”这样一句陈述所引出的算术问题，就非他的思维所能解决。这也需要大脑类似体育运动那样活动，在某一刻能运用最精细的逻辑，而在下一刻变得意识不到最基本的逻辑错误。愚蠢像智慧一样必要，也同样难以学到。

同时，他的脑子里部分也在琢磨有多快他们会枪毙他。“一切都取决于你自己。”奥布兰这样说过，然而他知道不能靠有意识的行为让这天提前到来。可能在十分钟之后，或者十年之后。他们可能把他单独关押好几年，可能把他送进劳改营，可能像有时会做的，释放他一段时间。完全有可能的是，被枪毙之前，他被逮捕和被审讯的整套情节都会重演一遍。唯一可以肯定的是，死亡从来不会在某个预期时间到来。传统做法——未曾说出口的传统做法，不管怎样你会知道，但从未听别人说起过——就是他们会从后面枪毙你，总是在脑袋后面，没有警告，就在你顺着走廊从一间牢房走向另一间时。

某天——不过“某天”不是正确的用词，只是因为它可能在某个深夜，可以说曾经——他陷入奇特而极其愉快的幻想。他正顺走廊走着，等待着子弹。他知道下一刻子弹就要到来。一切都解决了，消除了，和解了。不再有疑惑，不再有争辩，不再有痛楚，不再有恐惧。他的身体健康而强壮，他轻快地走着，因为感动而快乐，有种走在阳光下的感觉。他不再是走在仁爱部里那道长长的白色走廊上，而是在一条阳光普照的过道上，有一公里阔。走在那里，他好像处于药物作用下的极度兴奋中。他是在黄金乡，走在野兔啃噬的草场上的一条小径上，他能感受到脚下短短的、富于弹性的草地和照在脸上的温暖阳光。草场边上是榆树，在微微颤动着，草场尽头某处是那条溪流，鲮鱼在柳树之下的绿色池塘里懒懒游动着。

突然，他变得惊恐万状，汗水顺着他的脊梁一下子流下来。他听到自己在大声喊叫：

“茱莉娅！茱莉娅！茱莉娅，我的爱人！茱莉娅！”

有那么一阵子，他有了极其强烈的幻觉，就是茱莉娅出现在他面前。她似乎不仅出现了，而且到了他体内，似乎她进入了他的皮肤肌理中。那一刻，他对她的爱比他们自由在一起时还要强烈得多，他也知道在某个地方，她还活着，而且需要他的帮助。

他又躺回床上。他做了什么？那软弱的一刻能让他的苦役增加多少年？

又过了一阵子，他听到外面响起皮靴声。他们不可能不对这样的发作进行惩罚。如果他们以前不曾知道，这次则是知道了，也就是他正在违反和他们之间达成的协议。他服从党，却依然仇恨党。过去，他在顺从的外表下掩藏着异端思想，现在又后退了一步：他在大脑里已经投降，却希望自己的内心深处保持不变。他知道自己做错了，却宁愿做错。他们会明白的——也就是说奥布兰会明白，在那愚蠢的一声叫喊里，全坦白出来了。

他只能从头开始，也许要花上几年。他抚摸自己的脸庞，想让自己熟悉新的模样。他的脸颊凹陷很深，颧骨摸着很尖，鼻子变平了。另外，从上次看到自己的镜中模样以来，他领到了一副新的假牙。在不知道自己的脸庞是什么样时，不容易保持难测的表情，不管怎样，仅仅控制外表还不够。他第一次认识到，要想保住秘密，必须把它藏得连自己也不知道。你必须时时知道它就在那儿，然而不到需要时，你必须永远不让它以任何叫得上来的名堂进入你的意识。从此以后，他必须不只要想得正确，还必须感觉正确，梦得正确。同时，他也必须把自己的仇恨锁在体内，它就像是个有形的球体，成了身体的一部分，却跟他的其余部分没有联系，类似囊肿。

有一天，他们会决定枪毙他，说不准何时发生，然而可以提前几秒钟猜到。总是从后面，正在走廊上走着时，只要十秒钟就够。那时，他体内的世界会翻转过来，然后突然之间，不说一句话，没有停下脚步，脸上的表情一点没变——伪装突然撤下。砰！他仇恨的炮群开火了。仇恨会像熊熊大火一样充满他，几乎就在同时，砰！子弹来了，太晚了，或者太早了。他们会在改造他的大脑之前把他崩成碎片，那种异端思想会不受惩罚，未曾悔悟，永远在他们的掌握之外。他们会在自身的完美之上崩一个洞。死时仍然仇恨他们，这就是自由。

他闭上眼睛。这比接受一条思维准则还要困难，是个自我贬低、自我糟塌的问题，他一定会投入最最肮脏的污秽中，而最可怕、最令人厌恶的会是什么？他想到了老大哥。那张巨大的面孔（因为经常在宣传画上看到，他总觉得有一米宽）好像自动浮现在他脑海，长着浓密的黑色八字胡，眼睛跟着人转来转去。他对老大哥的真实感情是什么？

过道里响起了沉重的皮靴声，铁门当的一声打开了，奥布兰走进牢房，他身后，是那个长着蜡像脸的警官和身穿黑制服的看守。

“起来，”奥布兰说，“过来。”

温斯顿站在他面前，奥布兰把双手放在温斯顿的肩膀上，死死盯着他。

“你曾经想欺骗我，”他说，“那是愚蠢的，站直点些，看着我的脸。”

他顿了一下，然后又以更温柔的声音说：

“你在进步，在思维上，你只有很小的毛病，只是情感上没进步。告诉我，温斯顿——记着，别撒谎，你知道我总能识别谎言——告诉我，你对老大哥的真实感情是什么？”

“我恨他。”

“你恨他，好，那么你该进入最后一个阶段。你必须热爱老大哥，单是服从还不够，你必须热爱他。”

他松开温斯顿，把他向着看守轻推了一下。

“一零一房间。”他说。





第五章


在他被关押的每个阶段，他都知道——或者说他似乎知道——他在那幢没有窗户的大楼里的方位，也许在气压上略微有差异。看守殴打他的那间牢房是在地下，奥布兰审讯他是在高处靠近楼顶的地方。现在这个地方是在地下许多米，在最下边。

这间牢房比他待过的牢房中的多数都要大一些，但他几乎没注意周围的情况，只注意到他的正前方有两张小桌子，每张上面都铺了绿呢布。其中一张离他只有一两米，另外一张还要远些，靠近门口。他被直直绑在一张椅子上，紧得让他不能活动分毫，连脑袋也不能。有个类似垫子的东西从后面紧紧夹着他的脑袋，迫使他往正前方看。

有一阵子，他独自待着，后来铁门打开，奥布兰进来。

“你曾经问过我，”奥布兰说，“一零一房间里有什么。我告诉过你，你是知道答案的，每个人都知道。一零一房间里的东西是世界上最可怕的。”

铁门又打开了，走进一个看守，手里提着铁丝编织的一个东西，是盒子或篮子之类。看守把它放在远处那张桌子上。因为奥布兰所站的位置，温斯顿看不到是什么。

“什么是世界上最可怕的？”奥布兰说，“这要因人而异。可能是被活埋，或者被烧死，或者被淹死，或者用钉子钉死，或者是别的五十种死法。然而对有些人来说，最可怕的可能是很普通的东西，根本不致命。”

奥布兰往旁边挪了一点，温斯顿得以更清楚地看到桌子上那件东西。它是个长方形铁丝笼，有个可以拎的把手。固定在前端的，是个看上去像是击剑面罩的东西，凹面向外。虽然相距三四米，他仍能看出笼子被纵向隔成两半，每间里面都有某种动物。是老鼠。

“以你而言，”奥布兰说，“世界上最可怕的正好是老鼠。”

温斯顿第一眼看到笼子，立刻有预感地全身战栗起来，另外还有种不太清楚的恐惧感。但在此时，他突然明白笼子前端安装面罩状东西的意图何在，他感到五内俱寒。

“你不能那样做！”他声音嘶哑地高声喊道，“你不会的，不会的！那不可能！”

“你还记得吗，”奥布兰说，“也就是在你梦里经常会有的恐慌时刻？你前面有堵黑墙，还有你听到的喧闹声音。墙那边有某种可怕的东西，你也知道你明白那是什么，可是你不敢把它们拖出来。墙那边是老鼠。”

“奥布兰！”温斯顿尽力控制着自己的声音说，“你知道不需要这样。你想让我干什么？”

奥布兰没有直接回答，再次开口时，他带上有时会表现出的老师神态。他沉思着望向远处，像是在跟温斯顿身后的听众讲话。

“就其本身而言，”他说，“疼痛并非总能奏效，有时候一个人能够承受疼痛，甚至到了死时那一刻也能。然而对每个人来说，都有种不可忍受的——一种想都不敢想的，跟勇气和怯懦无关。你从高处摔下时，抓紧一条绳子并不是怯懦行为；你从深水里上来，往肺里吸满空气也不是怯懦行为，只是种不可违背的本能。老鼠也一样。对你来说，它们不可忍受，是你无法承受的一种压力，即使你希望承受也无法做到。让你干什么你都会。”

“可那是什么，是什么？我不知道是什么又怎么做呢？”

奥布兰提起笼子放到近处那张桌子上，把它小心翼翼地放在呢子桌布上。温斯顿能听到自己血脉贲张的声音，有种感觉他正在绝对孤寂地坐着，是在空旷而广袤的平地上，一块沐浴在阳光下的平坦沙漠，所有声音隔着沙漠，从极其遥远的地方传入他耳中。然而装着两只老鼠的笼子离他不到两米，那是个大无比的老鼠，老得鼻口部已经变得钝平凶猛，毛呈褐色而不是灰白色。

“老鼠，”奥布兰仍像对着无形的观众说道，“虽然它不过是啮齿类动物，但也是肉食性的，你也明白。你也听说过这个城市的贫民窟里有过的事。在有些街区，妇女不敢把她们的婴儿一个人留在家里，五分钟也不行。老鼠肯定会袭击婴儿，只要很短一段时间，就会把婴儿啃得只剩骨头。老鼠也会袭击生病或者快死的人，表现出惊人智力，知道一个人什么时候是无助的。”

笼子里突然传出一阵吱吱的尖叫声，在温斯顿听来，像是从很远的地方传来。两只老鼠正在打架，想冲破隔离网互咬。他还听到了绝望的低沉呻吟声，好像也不是他发出的。

奥布兰拎起笼子，拎起来时，他按下了笼子上的某个东西，传来一声脆响。温斯顿发狂似的想从椅子上挣脱，但是没指望，他身体的每一部分，甚至他的头部，都被固定得不可移动。奥布兰把笼子拿近一些，离温斯顿的脸不到一米。

“我已经按下了第一个控制杆，”奥布兰说，“你也明白这个笼子的构造。这个面罩会紧紧扣到你头上，不留一丁点儿空隙。我按下另一个控制杆，笼门就会滑开，这两个正在挨饿的东西会像子弹一样蹿出来。你有没有见过一只老鼠跳到空中的样子？它会跳到你的脸上并一直掏进去。有时候先咬眼睛，有时候会从颧骨那儿直掏进去，咬掉你的舌头。”

笼子又移近一些，越逼越近。温斯顿听到一连串尖叫声，似乎在他头部上方的空气中响着。但是他在跟自己的恐慌激烈斗争。想，想，甚至在最后一刹那——想是唯一的希望。突然，那东西难闻的霉味直冲他的鼻孔。他有种想呕吐的强烈感觉，几乎让他昏了过去，眼前一片漆黑。有那么一刻，他精神错乱，是头尖叫的动物。然而在一片漆黑中，他抓住了一个念头，只有一个办法可以救自己，他一定要把另外一个人——另外一个人的身体——放在他和老鼠之间。

这时，面罩的边缘大到能挡住让他看不到其他一切东西。铁丝门离他只有两手掌那么远，两只老鼠那时知道能啃到什么，其中一只跳上跳下，另一只比阴沟老鼠大得多，老得已经脱毛，它粉红色的爪子搭在铁丝栅上站立着，在猛嗅空气。温斯顿能看到它的鼠须和黄色牙齿。他再次陷入那种黑色的恐慌感，他看不见东西，毫无办法，脑子里空空如也。

“在中华帝国，这是种常见的刑罚。”奥布兰以他好为人师的一贯方式说道。

面罩逼向他的脸，铁丝在拂试他的脸颊。接着——不，那不是解脱，只是一丁点希望。太晚了，可能已经太晚了。但他突然明白在全世界只有一个人，他可以向其转移自己所受的惩罚——只有一个躯体，他可以将其推到自己与老鼠之间。于是他狂乱地喊了一遍又一遍：

“咬茱莉娅！咬茱莉娅！别咬我！咬茱莉娅！我不管你们把她怎么样。把她的脸撕碎，把她啃得只剩骨头。别咬我！咬茱莉娅！别咬我！”

他往后倒去，往极深的地方落下去，远离了老鼠。他仍被绑在椅子上，但已穿过地板向下坠落，穿过楼上的墙壁，穿过地球，穿过海洋，穿过大气层，进入外层空间，进入星际深渊——一直和老鼠远离，远离，远离。他远去了许多光年，但奥布兰仍站在他旁边，温斯顿的脸颊上仍有铁丝的冷冷触觉，然而从裹着他的黑暗中，他又听到一声金属相碰的咔嗒声，他知道笼子门咔嗒一声关上了，没有打开过。





第六章


栗树咖啡馆里几乎空无一人。一道阳光从窗户斜射进来，黄黄地照在落满灰尘的桌面上。那是十五点时候的人少时刻，电屏里播放着细细的音乐声。

温斯顿坐在经常坐的角落位置，在盯着一个空玻璃杯看。他不时抬头扫一眼对面墙上的一张巨大的面孔。“老大哥在看着你”，那是下方的标题。一个服务员主动过来往他的杯子里斟满胜利杜松子酒，又拿过一个瓶塞中间插了根管子的瓶子，往酒里倒进几滴液体并晃了晃。那是加了丁香味的糖精，是这家咖啡馆的特制品。

温斯顿在听电屏里传来的声音。这时只是在播放音乐，但随时可能有来自和平部的特别公报。来自非洲前线的新闻令人极为不安，他整天不时为之担心。一支欧亚国的军队（大洋国在跟欧亚国打仗，大洋国一直在跟欧亚国打仗）正以惊人速度向南推进。午间的公报没有明确地提到任何地区，但很有可能刚果河口已经是战场。布拉柴维尔和利奥波德维尔(1)有陷落的危险。人们没必要通过看地图才会了解这意味着什么，不只是即将失去中部非洲的问题，就连大洋国的领土也受到威胁，这在整场战争中是第一次。

一种强烈的情感在他心里燃烧起来，然后又消退了，说是恐惧并不确切，而是种说不清楚的激动之情。他不再想关于战争的事。近段时间，他从来不能长时间把心思集中到一件事情上。他端起酒杯一饮而尽，跟往常一样，这让他打了个寒战，甚至还有点恶心。那种玩意太可怕了，丁香和糖精本身就让人恶心欲吐，但还是盖不住浓浓的油味，而最糟糕的是杜松子酒的气味——他一天到晚身上都有这种气味——在他脑海里，不可避免地与某种东西的气味掺和在一起，那是——

他从未点明那是什么，即使想到时也没有，只要有可能，他一直避免去想它们的样子。它们是他部分意识到的东西，近在眼前逗留着，那股气味在他鼻孔里久久不去。酒意泛上来时，他张开紫色的嘴唇打了个嗝。自从获释以来，他长得胖了些，也恢复了以前的颜色——甚至不仅仅恢复了而已。他的面貌有起色，鼻子和颧骨上的颜色是粗糙的红色，甚至他秃顶的头皮也颜色深得不能算是粉红色。一个服务员又是不经吩咐，就拿来一张棋盘和最新一期《泰晤士报》，而且已经翻到有象棋残局的那页。然后看到温斯顿的杯子已空时，他拿来酒瓶又给他斟满，不需要吩咐，他们知道他的习惯。棋盘总是准备好让他玩，他所坐那张位于角落的桌子总是为他留着，甚至当咖啡馆里坐满人时，他仍是独自坐在那张桌子前，因为没人愿意被看到跟他坐得较近。他从来懒得数他喝了几杯。过上或长或短一段时间，他们会给他送上一张脏纸说那是账单，但他感觉他们总少算他钱。就算他们多收他钱也没什么关系，他如今钱总是够花。他甚至还有了份工作，是个挂名的闲职，却比他以前的工作收入还多。

电屏里播放的音乐停了，接着响起一个说话声，温斯顿仰起脑袋听。没有来自前方的公报，只是来自富足部的一则简短通知。好像上个季度，第十个三年计划中关于鞋带的生产指标超额完成了百分之九十八。

他研究了一下象棋残局，开始摆上棋子。那是个棘手的残局，要用到两个马。“白方先走，两步将死对方。”温斯顿抬头看着老大哥的肖像。总是白方将死对方，他以一种模糊的神秘感思考着。总是如此，从无例外，就是如此安排好的。自从开天辟地以来，在所有象棋残局中，黑方从未赢过一次。难道这不是象征着正义永远会，而且无一例外会战胜邪恶吗？那张巨大的面孔也盯着他，它充满了沉着的力量。只有白方是重要的。

电屏里传来的声音停顿了一下，然后又以一种不同的，然而严肃得多的声调说：“特此提醒，要准备好在十五点三十分收听一项重要通知。十五点三十分！这是最重要的新闻！注意不要错过。十五点三十分！”接着又响起叮叮咚咚的音乐。

温斯顿心里动了一下。那会是来自前方的公报，直觉告诉他将要来的是坏消息。关于在非洲惨败的念头一整天都时不时出现在他脑海里，给他带来一小阵一小阵的激动。他似乎真的看到欧亚国军队像一队队蚂蚁涌过从来未被攻破过的边界，向非洲下方的尖角涌去。为什么没有可能以某种方式包抄他们呢？他的脑海里出现了西非海岸的鲜明轮廓。他拿起白方的马在棋盘上移动，那里就是合适位置。甚至正当他看着黑压压的军队向南挺进时，他也看到另外一支神秘集合起来的军队突然插入他们后方，将其陆路及海路联系全部切断。他感觉通过意愿，他可以无中生有地令一支部队出现，然而需要迅速行动。如果他们控制整个非洲，在南非好望角建造起机场及潜艇基地，大洋国就会被一分为二。这也许会带来某种后果：失败，解体，世界的重新分割还有党被摧毁！他深吸一口气，百感交集的感觉——但准确点说不能算是百感交集，而是一层叠一层的感觉，也不好说哪层感觉是最基本的——在他心里翻腾着。

那阵感情波澜过去了，他把白马放回原位，但这时他无法认真思考棋局的问题。他又走了神，几乎是无意识地在桌面的落尘上写道：



2＋2＝5



“他们进入不了你的内心。”她曾经说过，然而他们能够进入你的内心。“在这里发生在你身上的事将永远抹不掉。”奥布兰曾经说过，那是实话。你无法恢复某些事情，还有自己的行为，你内心的某些东西被毁掉、烧掉并且烙掉了。

他见到过她，甚至跟她说过话，那样做不会有什么危险，他似乎本能地知道他们现在对他的所作所为不再感兴趣。他们两人如果谁愿意，他能和她再次见面。实际上他们碰巧遇到过，那是在公园里，在三月里寒冷刺骨、天气恶劣的一天。当时的地面像铁块一般冰硬，小草似乎全死光了，到处看不到一个花蕾，只有很少几株番红花费力地露出头，却被风摧残得凋零不堪。他当时正在脚步匆匆地走着，双手冰冷，眼里还流着泪，就在那时，他看到她就在前方不到十米远。他马上看出她变了，但说不上来怎样变了。他们几乎没有表示地擦肩而过，接着他转过身，也不是很急切地跟在她身后。他知道那不会有危险，没有谁会注意他们。她没说话，而是斜向穿过草地，似乎想摆脱他，后来好像又接受了他在旁边。不久，他们到了一带蓬乱无叶的灌木丛，既藏不了身，也挡不住风。他们停下脚步。那天冷得邪门，风呼啸着掠过树枝，撕扯着零星几朵脏乎乎的番红花。他搂住了她的腰。

那里没有电屏，但肯定藏有麦克风，另外他们也能被看到。那无关紧要，一切都无关紧要。他们想的话，可以躺到地上做那事。想到这里，他的身体因为极度厌恶而变得僵硬。她对他紧紧搂着，她未做出任何反应，甚至也没有努力挣脱。他现在知道她有什么变化了。她脸上多了点黄灰色，还有一道长长的疤痕，从前额一直到太阳穴，然而变化并非在此，而在于她的腰部变粗了一些，而且令人惊讶地变得僵硬。他记得有次在一颗火箭弹爆炸后，他曾帮忙把一具尸体从废墟中拖出来，当时让他震惊的，不仅是那具尸体难以置信的重量，而且还有其僵硬程度和收拾的难度，使得与其说是血肉之躯，倒不如说更像一块石头。摸着茱莉娅的身体感觉也是如此，他想到她皮肤的肌理跟他见过的肯定也大不一样了。

他没有试图去吻她，他们也没说话。他们又穿回草地后，她第一次正面看了他一眼，但那仅仅是为时极短的一瞟，充满了鄙视和厌恶。他不知道厌恶纯粹是由于往事引起的，还是同时因为看到他那张浮肿的脸庞，以及由于刮风而让他不断往外流着的泪水所导致。他们坐到两张铁椅子上，并排，但不是紧挨着。他看到她就要开口说话。她把笨重的鞋子移开几厘米，有意踩断一根树枝。他注意到她的脚似乎变得宽了些。

“我背叛了你。”她直言不讳地说。

“我也背叛了你。”他说。

她厌恶地扫视他一眼。

“有时候，”她说，“他们会用一样东西威胁你——一样你无法忍受的东西，甚至是想不到的东西。你会说：‘别对我那样，对别人那样吧，对谁谁那样吧。’事后，你也许假装说那只是个计策，之所以那样说，是想让他们停下来，并非真的那样想。可那不是真的。发生那件事时，你确实是那样想的。你以为没有别的办法可以救自己，你完全愿意通过那种方式救自己。你想让它发生在另外一个人身上，你根本不在乎别人受什么罪，在乎的只是你自己。”

“你在乎的只是你自己。”他附和道。

“在那之后，你对另一个人的感觉就变了。”

“对，”他说，“你感觉不一样了。”

似乎没有更多的话可说。他们薄薄的工作服被风吹得贴紧了身体，他们几乎同时都觉得不说话坐在那里是件尴尬事，另外坐着不动也太冷了。她说了要去赶地铁什么的，起身就要走。

“我们一定要再见面。”他说。

“对，”她说，“我们一定要再见面。”

他迟迟疑疑地跟着她走了一小段路，在她后面落后半步。他们没再开口说话。她也不是真的想甩掉他，走的速度却刚好能避免让他跟她并排走。他已经打定主意要跟着她一直走到地铁站，但是突然，像这样在寒风中跟在别人身后走似乎既无意义，又无法忍受。他强烈地想躲开茱莉娅再回到栗树咖啡馆，那里好像前所未有地具有强烈的吸引力。他怀旧地想起他那张位于角落的桌子，还有报纸、棋盘以及长喝长添的杜松子酒，最主要是那里会是暖和的。又过了一阵子，也不完全是出于意外，他由着一小群人把他和茱莉娅隔开了。他半心半意想赶上她，接着又放慢脚步，转身向相反方向走开。他走了有五十米时，又回头看了看。那条街上的人并非很多，却已经看不清她在哪里。十几个匆匆走着的人当中，哪一个都有可能是她，可能她那变粗也变僵硬的身躯从后面已经认不出了。

“发生那件事时，”她这样说过，“你确实是那样想的。”他的确是那样想的，他不仅那样说了，而且也希望过那样。他希望是她而不是他，被任由——

电屏里传来的音乐变了，一个刺耳的嘲弄音符，一个预警音响起来了。接着——也许并未发生什么，也许只是种类似声音的记忆——一个声音唱道：



在绿荫如盖的栗子树下，

我背叛了你，你背叛了我——



他眼里涌出了泪水，一个经过的服务员看到他杯子空了，就拿着酒瓶又走过来。

他举起酒杯闻了闻。每喝一口那种东西，它的难喝程度不是减轻而是更甚，然而它已经成为他生活中不可或缺的东西，就是他的生命、死亡和再生。是杜松子酒让他每天夜里变得不醒人事，每天早晨也是靠它恢复精力。他很少能在十一点前醒来，而醒来时难以睁开眼睛，嘴巴发炎，脊骨也好像断了，如果不是有前一天晚上放在床边的酒瓶和茶杯，他甚至不可能坐起身。中午几个小时里，他会表情呆滞地坐着听电屏里播出的声音，酒瓶就在手边。从十五点到打烊时间，他是栗树咖啡馆的固定顾客。不再有人理会他干什么，没有唤醒他的哨声，没有电屏来警告他。有时，也许一星期两次吧，他会去到真理部的一间布满灰尘，似乎被弃置的办公室里干上一点工作，或者说所谓的工作。他被分配到某个委员会下面分委员会的分委员会，第一个委员会是为处理编纂第十一版新话词典中遇到的次要难点而成立的无数委员会之一。他们负责编制所谓中期报告，然而他从未查清楚他们要报告的是什么，好像跟逗号应该放在括号内还是括号外有关。这个分委员会里另外还有四个人，情况都跟他类似。某些天里他们会聚到一起，然后马上又分开，他们互相坦白承认实际上没有什么事情可做。但是还有一些时候，他们几乎是热切地着手工作，极尽表现之能事，填写记录，起草从未完成的备忘录。他们为按说需要争论的事情而争论，越争论越复杂、越深奥，为定义玄玄乎乎各执一词，跑题千里，争吵，甚至还威胁捅到上一级。后来突然，他们都没了精神，会围坐在桌子前眼神暗淡地互相看着，就像听到鸡鸣的鬼魂一样。

电屏沉默了一会儿。温斯顿又抬起头。公报！不过没有，只是换播音乐而已。他闭上眼睛就能想起非洲地图，军队的动向以示意图显示出来：一根黑箭头垂直插向南方，一条白箭头往东水平切去，穿过黑箭头的尾部。像是为了寻找安慰，他抬头看着那张肖像的沉着面孔。有没有可能第二个箭头根本不存在？

他的兴趣衰退了。他又喝了一大口酒，捡起白方的马试探着走了一步。将。但是显然走得不正确，因为——

一段记忆又自动浮现在他脑海，他看到一个点着蜡烛的房间，里面有张铺着白色床单的大床，还有他自己。他是个九岁或十岁的小男孩，正坐在地上，在摇着骰子盒兴奋地笑着，他母亲坐在他对面，也在笑。

那肯定是在她失踪前一个月的事。那是个和好的时刻，温斯顿忘了肚子里从未停止过的饿意，对她有过的爱意暂时复苏了。那天的事他记得很清楚。外面电闪雷鸣，大雨如注，雨水顺窗棂潺潺流着，室内暗得无法看书。他们两个小孩子在那间阴暗狭窄的卧室里厌烦得无法忍受。温斯顿又是哭啼，又是哀求，徒劳地想多要一点食物，在房间里烦躁不安，把所有东西都东拉西扯，还踢护墙板，直到邻居敲打隔墙，而那个比他还小的孩子在断断续续哭着。直到最后他母亲说：“听话，我去给你买个玩具，一个好玩的玩具，你会喜欢的。”然后她就走进雨地，当时附近零星还有几间小杂货店。她回来时手里拿了个纸板盒，里面装了一副蛇梯棋(2)。他仍然能闻到淋湿了的棋盘的气味。那副棋做得很糟糕，棋盘裂了纹，小木头骰子切割得不好，以至于难以躺平。温斯顿不高兴也不感兴趣地看着它，但后来他母亲点了根蜡烛，他们坐在地板上玩了起来。不久，当那个小圆片带着希望爬到梯顶，然后又一滑而下到了有蛇的地方，几乎回到开始处时，他变得兴高采烈而且大声笑着。他们玩了八盘，他赢了四盘。他那长得很小的妹妹年幼得不明白怎么下棋，却也靠着枕头坐在那里笑，是因为别人都在笑。他们在一起开心了整整一下午，像他早期童年时那样。

他努力想把这一场景从脑子里忘掉。那是种虚假的记忆，他有时会受到虚假记忆的困扰。只要知道其本质，就无关紧要。有些事情发生过，别的没发生过。他转过身看着棋盘，再次拿起白方的马。几乎就在同时，它咔嗒一声掉到棋盘上，他吓了一跳，似乎有根大头针插进了他的身体。

一声尖厉的小号声刺破空气。公告来了！胜利！新闻之前响起小号总意味着胜利。一种电流般的震颤掠过咖啡馆，就连服务员也吓了一跳，也竖起耳朵。

小号声之后是十分高亢的噪音。电屏里传来一个激动的声音，在急促地念着，但是刚一开始，就被外面雷鸣般的欢呼声淹没。新闻在街头奇迹般不胫而走。他勉强能听到电屏里播放的东西，明白事情正是按照他所预测的发生：一支巨大的海上舰队秘密集结起来，对敌人后方进行了突袭，白色箭头切过黑色箭头的尾巴。胜利的语句不时从一片喧嚣中冒出来：“大规模的战略调动——完美的协同作战——完全击溃——俘敌五十万——对士气的彻底打击——控制整个非洲——向战争的结束推进了一大步——胜利——人类历史上最辉煌的胜利——胜利，胜利，胜利！”

温斯顿的脚在桌子下面痉挛性抽动着。他没有从座位上起身，然而在脑子里，他在跑着，飞快地跑着，跟外面的人群在一起，欢呼得双耳欲聋。他又抬头看着老大哥的肖像。驾御世界的巨人啊！抵挡亚洲群氓的中流砥柱！他想到十分钟之前——对，仅仅十分钟之前——在想着前线的消息的不知是胜利还是失败时，他心里还有些模糊的感觉。啊，不止是一支欧亚国的军队被消灭了！从他进了仁爱部的第一天以来，他身上发生了很多变化，但是最终的、必不可少的、康复性的变化却从未发生过，直至这一刻。

电屏里的声音仍在滔滔不绝播报关于俘虏、战利品和屠杀的事，外面的喊叫声却低了一些。服务员转过身又开始工作，其中有个拿着酒瓶走过来。温斯顿依然沉浸在喜悦的白日梦中，没有注意到服务员正在斟满他的酒杯。他内心里既没再奔跑，也没再欢呼，他又回到了仁爱部，一切都被宽恕了，他的灵魂像雪一样洁白。他站在法庭的被告席上，坦白一切，牵连进每个人。他在铺了白瓷砖的走廊上走着，感觉像是走在阳光下，一个持枪看守在他身后。期待了很久的那颗子弹正在射进他的大脑。

他抬头盯着那张巨大的面孔，他用了四十年，才了解到隐藏在那两撇黑色八字胡下的微笑。噢，残酷啊，不必要的误解啊！噢，顽固啊，从那个博爱的胸怀处自行放逐自己！两颗有着杜松子气味的泪珠从他鼻侧流了下来。不过那样也好，一切都很好，斗争已经结束，他赢得了跟自己的战争，他热爱老大哥。

新话的原则


新话为大洋国的官方语言，是为满足“英社”（Ingsoc）或称“英国社会主义”（English Socialism）的意识形态需要而发明的。一九八四年时，还未能达到人人将其作为讲话或写作的唯一一种交流工具。《泰晤士报》上的重头文章是用新话写的，但那是只能由专家执笔完成的精心杰作。按计划，到二零五零年左右，新话将最终替代旧话（或者按照我们所称是“标准英语”）。同时新话正稳步替代旧话，所有党员倾向于越来越多在日常生活中使用新话中的词及语法结构。一九八四年时使用的新话版本以及在第九、第十版新话词典中体现出来的新话是临时性的，其中包含许多过剩的词以及旧词形，那些以后都将在被废止之列。在此我们要讨论的，是新话的最终和完善的版本，体现在新话词典第十一版中。

新话的目标不仅是提供一种表达工具，用以表达对英社的忠实信徒来说适于拥有的世界观及思维习惯，而且要让其他任何思考模式变得不可能存在。新话的目标是当新话彻底被采用而且旧话被遗忘后，任何异端思想——即与英社原则相悖的思想——将完全不可能被想到，至少在思想尚依赖话语表达的情况下将是如此。新话的词汇之所以如此构建，目的是让党员欲合适表达每种意图时，都能精确而且常常是十分敏锐地表达，而排除了所有其他意图存在以及通过间接途径使其得到表达的可能性。要想做到这一点，部分是靠发明出新词，但主要是靠消灭一些不合需要的词，以及清除被保留下来的单词的非正统含义，而且只要可能，将所有次一层的含义全部清除。举个简单的例子，“free”这个词在新话中仍然存在，但只能用在这样的陈述句中：“This dog is free from lice”（这条狗身上不长虱子）或“This field is free from weeds”（这块田里不长野草），而不能用到这个词的旧含义，即“politically free”（政治上自由）和“intellectually free”（思想上自由）。因为政治自由及思想自由即使作为概念都已不复存在，因而有必要不以名称称之。而且远不限于废止那些确实具有异端性质的词，词汇总量被认为是为减少而减少，凡是并非一定用得到的词，都不允许存在。发明新话的目的，不是为了扩展思想的范围，而是为了缩小它，将可供选择的词汇数量减到最少，能够间接有利于达到这一目的。

新话建立在我们所掌握的英语的基础上，然而有许多新话的句子，甚至那些不含有新造词的句子对于我们当今操英语的人来说，也几乎不可理解。新话的词汇分成不同类型的三类，以A类词汇、B类词汇（又称复合词）、C类词汇称之。较简单的办法是分别讨论三类词汇，有关这种语言在语法上的独特性，可以在讨论A类词的那部分论及，因为同样的规则对这三类词汇都适用。



A类词汇：A类词汇包括日常生活中做各种事情时需要用到的词，这些事情包括吃、喝、工作、穿衣、上下楼梯、乘车、栽培花木、烹调等等之类。这类词几乎完全由已有的单词组成的——像“hit”、“run”、“dog”、“tree”、“sugar”、“house”、“field”等——不过跟我们当今的英语比起来，这些词的数量特别少，对其定义却严格得多，所有含糊不清以及其他多层含义都被一概清除。在能够做到的情况下，新话中的这类词汇简单地说，就是一个断音，表达的是一个在理解上清晰无误的概念。完全不可能使用A类词汇进行文学写作或进行政治及哲学性讨论，其用途就是表达简单及意图明确的想法，一般说来涉及的是具体事物或者身体动作。

新话的语法有两个突出特性：第一，不同时态几乎完全可以混用。这种语言中的任何一个词（从原则上说，这一点甚至适用于像“if”或“when”这类非常抽象的词）都能用作动词、名词、形容词甚至副词。在词根相同的情况下，动词和名词之间无任何词形变化，这条规则本身导致许多旧词形被消灭。以“thought”一词为例，它在新话中不存在，而被“think”一词所代替，该词既充当名词，又充当动词。在此情况下，不遵循语源学的规则，但在有些情况下，决定保留原来的名词形式，在另外一些情况下则保留原来的动词形式。甚至在两个含义相近的名词或动词没有语源学联系的情况下，其中之一经常被废止。例如根本没有“cut”这个词，它的含义完全被名词兼动词“knife”所包括。形容词是通过给名词加“-ful”这样的后缀，副词是名词加后缀“-wise”而得到。因此，例如“speedful”的含义就是“rapid”，“speedwise”的含义就是“quickly”。我们目前使用的某些形容词，像“good”、“strong”、“big”、“black”、“soft”都被保留下来了，然而这些被保留下来的单词的总量很少。人们很少需要用到这些词，因为几乎所有的形容词含义都可以通过在名词兼动词后面加“-ful”而得到。除了很少几个已经是以“-wise”为结尾的词，现在的所有副词一个都不会被保留下来，副词无一例外都将以“-wise”结尾。例如像“well”这个词，它会被“goodwise”所代替。

另外，任何单词——这在原则上也适用于新话语言里所有的词——都能通过加“un-”前缀而使其具有否定意义，或者通过加“plus-”前缀进行强调，或者如果为了进一步强调，可以加上“doubleplus-”这样的前缀。因此，例如“uncold”的意义是“暖和”，“pluscold”和“doublepluscold”的意义分别是“很冷”和“极其冷”。跟现代英语一样，也有可能通过利用像“ante-”、“post-”、“up-”、“down-”等前缀对几乎任何单词的含义进行更改。可以看出，通过这些方法，能对词汇总量进行极大删减。例如既然有“good”一词，就没必要保留“bad”这样的词，因为“ungood”同样可以表达所需意义——事实上还要更好。凡是在两个词天然互为反义词的情况下，都需要决定两者之中哪个将被废止。例如，“dark”这个词可以被“unlight”所取代，或者“light”也可以被“undark”取代，如何选择，视喜好而定。

新话语法的第二个突出特点是它的规律性。除了下面提到的几种例外情况，所有词形变化都遵循同样规则。因此，所有动词的过去式和过去分词都同样以“-ed”结尾。“steal”的过去式是“stealed”，“think”的过去式是“thinked”，全部新话语言中都是这样，所有像“swam”、“gave”、“brought”、“spoke”、“taken”等旧词形都被废止。所有复数都视情况加“-s”或“-es”，、“man”、“ox”、“life”这些词的复数形式是“mans”、“oxes”、“lifes”。形容词的比较级和最高级无一例外都是加“-er”和“-est”（“good”，“gooder”，“goodest”），不规则变化和像加“more”和“most”这种结构，都在被废止之列。

仅剩的仍被允许进行不规则变化的词是名词、关系形容词和指示形容词及副词，除了“whom”已被当做多余词去掉，以及像“shall”、“should”所代表的时态已被取消之外——这些时态的用法都已被“will”和“would”所包括——所有这些词都仍按以前的旧用法使用。另外，出于迅速及易于说出的需要，仍存在一些不规则变化。如果一个词不易发音，或者有可能让人听不准，就会根据该事实本身，被当做是个坏词，因此考虑到悦耳因素，偶尔会在一个词中间加上别的字母或者保留旧词形。但这种需求主要体现在B类词汇中。至于为什么易于发音这么重要，下文中会解释清楚。



B类词汇：B类词汇都是为了政治目的而有意创造出来的，也就是说，这些词不仅每个都具有政治含义，而且创造这些词的目的，就是让使用这些词的人具有合乎需要的思想态度。如果未能全面理解英社的原则，就用不好这些词。对有些词而言，可以翻译成旧话，甚至可以用A类词汇翻译出来，但通常都需要大段释义，而且总会造成这些词所具有的言外之意的丧失。B类词汇是种口头速记，总是把一系列概念放进几个音节之中，同时又比一般语言更准确、更有力。

B类词汇都是复合词(1)。

他们由两个或两个以上的单词，或者几个单词的部分所组成，以一种易于发音的词形结合而成。由此产生的混合词都会是名词兼动词，遵循一般的变形规则。举个简单的例子，“goodthink”的含义大致就是“正统”，或者在它用作动词时，含义就是“以正统的方法思考”。这个单词的变形如下：名词兼动词，“goodthink”；过去式及过去分词，“goodthinked”；“goodthinking”；现在分词，形容词，“goodthinkful”；副词“goodthinkwise”；动名词，“goodthinker”。

B类词汇完全不是按照词源学方案造出来的。构成B类词汇的单词可以是任何时态，以任何顺序排列，以及按照任何方式修改，目的为使这些词易于发音，而且同时也能说明其出处。例如，在“crimethink”一词中“think”在后，而在“thinkpol”一词中它在词首。后一个单词“police”少了第二个音节。因为达到悦耳这点更困难些，B类词汇中的非常规词形比A类词汇中出现得还要多一些。例如说，“Minitrue”、“Minipax”、“Miniluv”三词的形容词分别是“Minitruthful”、“Minipeaceful”和“Minilovely”，这只是因为“-trueful”、“-paxful”和“-loveful”略微有点难于发音。然而从原则上说，所有B类词汇都可以变形，而且都以完全同样的方式变形。

B类词汇中有些词的含义非常隐晦，未能在整体上掌握这种语言的人很难理解这些词。例如拿《泰晤士报》的重头文章中“Oldthinkers unbellyfeel Ingsoc”这典型一句来说，用旧话把它表达出来的最简短的说法是“那些其观念在革命之前就形成的人们对英国社会主义无法拥有感情上的充分理解”。然而这种翻译不完整。

首先，为理解上面所引一句新话的全部含义，人们必须充分理解“Ingsoc”的含义，其次，只有精通英社的人，才能充分体会到“bellyfeel”一词的全部力量，它意味着如今难以想象的盲目而且热情的赞同；还有“oldthink”一词，它与邪恶与堕落牢牢挂上了钩。但是新话中的某些词汇具有特殊功用——“oldthink”就是其中之一——与其说这些词在表达含义，倒不如说在消灭含义。这些词——数目不大，这是必要的——将自身的含义扩展，直到自身包含了一连串单词，这些单词由于已被完全包含在一个综合术语中，因而可以被抛弃并忘掉。新话编纂者要面对的最大困难不是创造新词，而是创造出新词后，确定其含义为何，也就是说在造出这些词后，确定其取消的是哪类词。

我们已经看到以“free”为例的一词，有过异端含义的词有时为方便起见被保留下来，但被清除掉不合适的含义。像“honour”、“justice”、“morality”、“internationalism”、“democracy”、“science”和“religion”那些无数单词简单地说，是被消灭了，少数几个表示总称的词包含了这些词，通过包含而将其消灭。例如，所有围绕自由和平等概念的单词都被“crimethink”这个词所包含，所有围绕客观和理性主义的词都被“oldthink”这个词所包含，要想更精确一点则是危险的。党员被要求具有的世界观跟古代希伯莱人的世界观类似，那些人不需要知道很多别的事，只需要知道除了他那个民族，别的民族崇拜的都是“假神”就够了，他们不需要知道那些神叫做“Baal”、“Osiris”、“Moloch”、“Ashtaroth”之类。也许他知道得越少，就越能正统。他知道耶和华和耶和华的戒条，与此类似，党员知道什么是正当行为，也非常模糊地笼统知道不正当行为可能是什么样的行为。例如，他的性生活完全由新话中的“sexcrime”和“goodsex”两个词所约束。“sexcrime”概括了所有种类的性犯罪，包括淫乱、通奸、同性恋及其他变态行为，没必要将其一一列举，因为它们同样应受到惩罚，而且原则上说惩罚都是死刑。C类词汇中——由科学技术方面的单词所组成——可能需要为某些性失常行为命名，但一般人用不着那些词。他知道“goodsex”是什么意思，也就是男人跟他妻子之间为了生出孩子这唯一目的而进行的性交，女方身体上没有快感，所有别的都是“sexcrime”。新话中，很少有可能在认识到某个念头是异端念头后还能继续往下想，除了能想到它是异端念头这一点，其他所需之词都不存在。

B类词汇在意识形态上都并非中立，很多是委婉语。例如，像“joycamp”（劳改营）或“minipax”（和平部，即战争部）所指的几乎与其表面意思恰恰相反。另一方面，有些单词所表现的，是对大洋国社会本质的赤裸裸而且有着蔑视意味的理解。以“prolefeed”为例，它的含义是党给予群众的垃圾娱乐以及欺骗性新闻。还有另外一些词褒贬均有，用到党身上是指“好的”，用到敌人身上是指“坏的”。另外还有大量单词，乍一看不过是些缩写，其意识形态色彩不是来自其含义，而是构造。

只要有可能，一切具有或可能具有任何政治重要性的词都被放进B类词汇。所有组织、团体、学说、地区、机构或者公共建筑的名称都无一例外，都被削减成一个为人熟悉的词形，即一个易于发音的单词，具有尽可能少的音节，又能保存原来的词源。例如在真理部，温斯顿·史密斯所在的档案司（the Record Department）被称为“Recdep”，小说司（the Fiction Department）被称为“Ficdep”，电屏节目部（the Teleprogrammes Department）被称为“Teledep”，诸如此类。这样做并非单纯为了节省时间。甚至在二十世纪头几十年里，电报式简明语言已经是政治语言的特征之一。人们也注意到在极权主义国家和极权主义组织中，使用这种缩略语的倾向最为明显，例如这些词：“Nazi”、“Gestapo”、“Comintern”、“Inprecor”、“Agiprop”。一开始，采用缩略语是本能行为，但在新话中则是目的明确地使用。他们认识到通过对某个名称进行缩略，削减掉不用缩略语时会产生的其他联想，该名称的含义就会被窄化而且被微妙地改变。例如，“Communist International”（共产主义者国际组织）这个词能让人联想到一幅由全人类友爱、红旗、街垒、卡尔·马克思和巴黎公社所组成的画面，另一方面，“Comintern”一词仅代表一个结构严密的组织和一种明确的教义，它指的是像一张椅子或一张桌子这样一听即明、别无他义的东西。“Comintern”这个词能几乎不假思索地说出来，“Communist International”则能让人在说出时，必定有至少是片刻的踌躇。同样，“Minitrue”所引起的联想比“Ministry of Truth”要更少一些，而且更易于控制。这不仅能够解释为何会有尽可能使用缩略语这种习惯，而且可以解释为何人们不遗余力让每个词易于发音，以致做得有些过分。

在新话中，除了含义精确这一点，最重要的就是悦耳，必要时，总是不惜违反语法来迁就这点。这也正体现在那些发音短促、意义明白的单词上，因为这些词最重要的目的，是政治性目的，它们可以被说话者迅速说出，并在其大脑内激起的回响最小。B类词汇甚至因为个个很类似，而显得更有力。几乎无一例外，这些单词——“goodthink”、“minipax”、“prolefeed”、“sexcrime”、“joycamp”、“Ingsoc”、“bellyfeel”、“thinkpol”及无数别的单词——都只有两个或三个音节，重音均匀地落在第一和最后的音节上。使用这些词，有助于形成一种急促而含糊的讲话风格，它既单调，也没有抑扬顿挫，这也正是目的所在，用意就是让讲话时——特别在关于并非中性的主题时——尽量接近于脱离意识。日常说话时，无疑需要——或者说有时候需要——先想后说，然而当一个党员在被要求作出某个政治性或道德性判断时，他会像一架机关枪迸射出子弹一样，自动迸射出正确的意见。他所接受的训练让他可以做到这点，新话语言给了他一种几乎万无一失的工具，这些词的构造——由于跟英社精神相一致的刺耳发音以及一定程度上的不堪入耳之处——更是让他用得得心应手。

还有项事实是可供选择的单词很少。跟我们如今的词汇量相比，新话的词汇量极小，而且经常还会想出一些减少词汇量的新方法。确实，新话跟几乎所有其他种类语言的区别之处，在于其词汇量每年都在缩减，而不是增多。每减少一次，就是前进一步，因为可选用的词汇越少，进行思考的诱惑就越小。希望最后能达到这样的目的，即可以直接从喉咙里滔滔不绝地讲话，完全不需用到高一级的大脑中枢。这一目标在新话中以“duckspeak”不加掩饰地承认了，这个词的含义就是“像鸭子那样嘎嘎叫着说话”。如同B类词汇中为数极多的单词，“duckspeak”在含义上褒贬均有。在那些嘎嘎讲出的意见属正统的情况下，它除了赞美没有别的蕴涵意义，而当《泰晤士报》上称党内某位演讲家是个“doubleplusgood duckspeaker”时，就是对其热情洋溢、殊为难得的褒扬。



C类词汇：C类词汇是对另两类词汇的补充，完全由科技术语组成。这些词汇跟我们如今使用的科学术语类似，由同样的词根构建，但通常也要注意将其严格定义，并去掉不合适的含义。跟其他两类词汇一样，C类词汇遵循的是同样的语法规则。C类词汇中，有很少几个会在日常说话或政治讲话中用到。对任何一个科学工作人员或者技术员来说，都能在一个专门供他的专业使用的单词表中，找到所需的全部单词，然而对其他单词表中出现的单词，只认识少数几个而已。只有很少几个词在各个单词表中共有，但是没有能够表述把科学当做思维习惯或者思想方法这方面功能的词汇，不管科学的哪个分支都是如此。确实，没有“Science”（科学）这样的词，它可能具有的全部意义都已完全被“Ingsoc”所包含。

综上所述，可以看出在新话中，除了在很低的水平上，想表达非正统意见几乎不可能。当然，异端邪说可能以很粗鲁的方式说出来，也就是漫骂性的话。例如，有可能说出“Big Brother is ungood”（老大哥不好）这种话，然而在正统的耳朵听来，如此宣称无非是种不言自明的荒谬意见，不可能被理由充分的论证所支持，因为没有所需的单词。对英社有害的观点只能以无词可以表达的模糊方式持有，而且只能以非常广义的术语称之，这些术语总括了一系列异端邪说并将其批判，但在这样做的同时，不需要将其定义。实际上，人们只能在把某些词非法翻译回旧话时，才能非正统地使用新话。例如，用新话也许会说出“All mans are equal”（人人平等）这样的句子，但仅仅和用旧话可能说出的“All men are redhaired”（人人都是红头发）是同一类话。这句话无语法错误，然而所表达的，是个显而易见的谎言——即每个人在个头、体重和力量上都相等。政治平等的概念不复存在，这个次要含义相应地从“equal”（平等）一词中已被清除。在一九八四年，当旧话仍是交流的常用手段时，理论上存在这种可能，即人们使用新话词语时，仍会记起原来的含义。实际上，对精通“双重思想”的人来说，避免这样毫不困难，然而再过两代人，甚至这种失误的可能性也不复存在。对一个在新话是唯一一种语言环境下长大的人来说，他不会知道“equal”一词有过“政治自由”这种次要含义，或者“free”有过“思想自由”这样的次要含义，正如一个从未听说过象棋的人不会意识到“王后”和“车”的次要含义。有许多罪行和错误他无力去犯，原因仅在于其无以名之，所以想象不到。可以预见，随着时间的推移，新话的突出特点将越来越显著——其词汇量变得越来越小，含义越来越严格，将新话词语用于不正当目的的可能性也日益减少。

旧话被一劳永逸取代之时，和过去的最后一缕联系就会被切断。如今历史已被重写，但过去的文献片断会在这里那里存在着，没有进行彻底的审查。只要人们还会用旧话，他就有可能阅读那些。将来，那些片段即使留下来，也会是不可理解、不可翻译的。除非它指的是某种技术步骤或者很简单的日常行为，或者在倾向上已经是正统的（用新话来说是“goodthinking”），否则不可能将旧话的任何一段翻译到新话中，实际上，这意味着凡是写于大约一九六零年以前的书本总体上说来，没有一本能被翻译出来。革命前的文献只能进行意识形态上的翻译——这就是说，在意义和语言上都改变了。拿《独立宣言》中著名的一段来说：



我们认为下述真理是不言而喻的：人人生而平等，造物主赋予了他们若干不可褫夺的权利，其中包括生命权、自由权和追求幸福的权利。为保障这些权利，人们才在他们中间设立了政府，而政府的正当权力，则来自被统治者的同意。任何形式的政府一旦对这些目标的实现起破坏作用，人民便有权予以更换或废除，以建立一个新政府……



如果将这段用新话翻译出来，根本不可能依然保留原意，最接近原意的翻译，可以用“crimethink”这个词来概括这一段。完全译出只能是种意识形态上的翻译，杰弗逊的话会变成对拥有绝对权力政府的颂扬之词。

确实，大批过去的文献都被这样改头换面过。为了面子起见，保存关于某些历史人物的记忆是可取的，但同时要把他们的成就变得与英社的哲学相一致。许多作家，如莎士比亚、弥尔顿、斯威夫特、拜伦、狄更斯及其他作家因此正在被翻译中。此项工作完成后，他们原先的作品以及留下来的其他文学作品都会被销毁。这些翻译工作进展缓慢而且艰难，预计在二十一世纪前十到二十年内可以完成。另外还有大批仅仅是实用方面的文献——不可缺少的技术手册之类——也必须以同样方式处理。主要出于留出时间来完成前期翻译工作的考虑，最终采用新话的年份被定得晚至二零五零年。

我为何写作


乔治·奥威尔



从很小的时候起，可能有五六岁吧，我就知道长大后我要当作家。约在十七岁到二十四岁之间，我试过放弃这个念头，然而在放弃时，也意识到那样做违背自己的真正天性，早晚我会不得不专下心来写书的。

家里的三个小孩中我排行老二，但往上往下都差了五岁。八岁以前，我几乎没见过我父亲。种种原因之下，我多少感到孤独，不久我就有了些不讨人喜欢的癖性，让我在上学期间一直不受欢迎。我有了那种孤独小孩会有的习惯，就是编故事和跟想象出来的人对话，我觉得自己在文学上的野心一开始混合了被孤立和被低估的感觉。我当时就知道我能够熟练运用文字，而且具有直面不愉快事实的能力。我觉得是这种能力创造出了一个有点个人化的世界，在其中我可以找回自信，平衡日常生活中的失意。尽管这样，我童年和少年期间所有严肃作品——即出发点是严肃的——总量不会超过六页纸。四岁或五岁时，我写下了第一首诗，我母亲记录下来，我全忘了，只知道是关于一头老虎的，它长着“椅子般的牙齿”——很不错的短语，可是我想是抄袭了布莱克的《老虎，老虎》。十一岁时，一九一四至一九一八年的战争爆发后，我写了首爱国诗发表在本地报纸上，两年后又发表了一首，是关于基钦纳(1)之逝的。我长大一点后，时不时写过糟糕而且是写了半截的“自然诗”，是乔治时代风格(2)。我还大约试过两次写短篇小说，差得目不忍睹。那就是我那么多年的确写到了纸上，而且是立意严肃的全部作品。

不过，这段时间从头到尾，某种意义上说我也从事过文学活动。先是下单交货的东西，我可以很快很容易地写出来，也不曾感到过多大乐趣。除了学校的作业，我还写过应景之作和打油诗，那些我能以如今看来惊人的速度写出来——十四岁时，我一星期左右就写了一部诗剧，仿的是阿里斯托芬(3)风格。我帮着编过学校里的杂志，有印出来的，也有手抄的。那些杂志是你能想像到的最滑稽和令人同情的东西，我编得比现在写的最垃圾的新闻报道还要轻松许多。但与此同时，在十五年乃至更久的时间里，我也以另外一种很不一样的方式进行文学训练：即编写关于自己的连载“故事”，那是一种仅仅存在于自己脑子里的日记，我相信这是小孩子和青少年都会有的习惯。很小时，我经常幻想自己是类似罗宾汉这样的人，幻想自己是从事令人心惊胆战冒险活动的英雄。但是很快，我的“故事”不再有拙劣的自恋性质，开始越来越多变成单纯对自己所作所为及所见的描写。一次几分钟地，会有诸如此类东西进入我的脑海：“他推门进入房间，一束经过细棉布窗帘过滤过的黄色太阳光斜照在桌子上，那里放了一盒半打开的火柴，旁边是墨水壶。他右手插在口袋里走到窗前。下面的街上，一只毛色是龟背纹的猫正在追赶一片落叶。”等等，等等。这个习惯一直持续到我二十五岁左右，贯穿了我的非文学生涯。虽然我不得不寻找合适的词，也确实寻找过，但我好像在几乎违背自己意愿地做这种描写性尝试，是处于外界的某种压力之下。我想我的“故事”肯定反映了我在不同年龄时仰慕过的作家的风格，但就我能回忆起的，“故事”总是具有一丝不苟的描写性特点。

十六岁前后，我突然发现了纯粹属于单词本身的乐趣，即单词的发音和关联。如《失乐园》的这一行——



于是他面对困厄，辛苦劳作

度日；困厄劳作也将其压迫。



如今在我看来，这好像也并非特别精彩，但那时却让我浑身发颤；而且以“hee”来拼写“he”(4)更是锦上添花。至于需要描写事物，当时我已经全知道了。如果说我当时就想写书，要写什么则已经清楚。我要写自然主义长篇巨著，有着并非皆大欢喜的结尾，里面充满了细致入微的描写和极为贴切的比喻，也充满了词藻华丽的段落，其中的用词部分是因为单词本身的发音。事实上，我完成的第一本小说《缅甸岁月》就相当接近那种风格，是我在三十岁时写的，但立意在之前很久就开始了。

我给出了所有背景方面的信息，因为我认为人们在一点也不了解某个作家早期发展过程的情况下，不可能了解他的写作动机。他的写作主题由其所处的时代而决定——至少在我们目前这个喧嚣和变革的时代是如此——然而在动笔前，他会形成一种情感上的姿态，那是他永远不可能完全与之脱离的。当然，他有一样工作要做，就是控制自己的性情，避免纠缠在某一不成熟的阶段，或者陷入某种不正常的情绪。但是，如果完全脱离早期所受影响，他就会扼杀自己的写作冲动。暂不论谋生需要，我认为写作有四种最重要的动机，至少对非诗歌写作而言是如此。这些动机在每位作家身上存在的程度不同，根据他生活的外部环境，所占比例也会时时变动。它们是：

纯粹的个人主义。渴望显得聪明、被谈论、死后被记着、报复在你童年时怠慢过你的成年人，等等。装作个人主义不是动机而且是很强的动机，那是欺人之谈。在此特点上，作家跟这些人有相通之处：科学家、艺术家、政治家、律师、战士、商界成功者——简而言之，是人类中的全体精英。人类中的大多数并非很自私。一过三十岁左右，他们几乎完全放弃了作为个人的感觉——主要为了别人活着，要么在苦差中压得喘不过气来。但还有另外少部分具有天分、随心所欲的人，他们决心一辈子到头为自己生活，作家就属于这类人。至于严肃作家，我要说总体而言，他们比记者更自负，更以自我为中心，尽管他们对金钱的兴趣要少一些。

美学热情。即对外部世界之妙处的感知，或者另一方面，对词语以及它们恰到好处排列的美感上的认知；对于一个发音对另一个发音的影响，或是好文字的精当，或是好小说的节奏给人的愉悦；渴望跟别人分享本人认为很有价值、不容错过的一段经历。美学冲动在很多作家身上很不明显，但即便是个小册子作者或者教科书作者，也会有些喜欢用的词，这些词为他所偏爱，并非出自实用方面的原因；要么他可能对印刷样式、边缘宽度等有强烈的偏爱。除了铁路时刻表之类，没有哪本书完全排除了美学考虑。

历史冲动。即渴望看到事情的本来面目，发现真相并将其载存，以供后来者使用。

政治目的——此处的“政治”是最广义上的含义。即渴望将世界向某一方向推动，改变人们应该努力实现的那种社会的概念。同样，没有哪本书完全无政治倾向。那种艺术应与政治无关的观点本身即一种政治态度。

可以看出，这些不同冲动一定互相争斗，而且一定会在不同人身上在不同时候波动不已。从本性上说——把“本性”当做刚踏入成人时具有的状态——我是个前三种动机大于第四种动机的人。在和平年代，我可能只会写些文字绚丽或者单纯描写性的书本，也可能几乎从来意识不到自己所持的政治信念。的确，我曾经不得不成为类似小册子作者的人。一开始，我在不合适的职业上花了五年（驻缅甸的印度皇家警察），然后我经历了贫困，有过失败的感觉。这些增强了我对权力的天生恨意，也第一次全面意识到工人阶级的存在，而在缅甸的工作让我对帝国主义的本质有了认识。然而这些经历不足以让我具有明确的政治倾向。然后就出现了希特勒和西班牙内战，等等。到一九三五年底，我仍然未能作出明确决定。我记得当时写了首小诗，表达了我的两难心态。



我也许会当个快乐的牧师，

活在两百年前，

就不变的世界末日布道，

也看着我的核桃树长高；



但是生在，唉，极坏的时代，

我错过了那个适意的避风港，

因为我的上唇长出了胡须，

而教士们的脸都刮得光光。



后来的日子仍是不错，

我们曾是如此易于高兴，

我们把烦心事轻轻放下，

置于树冠之中。



我们曾不以无知为耻，

欢乐如今却被我们掩饰；

苹果树枝上的黄鹂鸟

就能让我的敌人战栗。



可是姑娘的腰腹和杏林，

树荫下溪流里的斜齿鳊，

马匹，破晓时争斗的鸭子，

所有这些都成了泡影。



禁止再次做梦；

我们把欢乐粉碎或是藏起；

马匹是由不锈钢所造，

由矮个胖男人把它们骑。



我就是那条永远不动的蚯蚓，

一个无后宫可以逞威的宦官；

像尤金·亚拉姆(5)一样走在

牧师和政委(6)两人中间；



政委正给我算命，

收音机在响着，

而牧师保证我会有辆奥斯汀牌小汽车，

因为克己奉公总有收获。(7)



我梦见住在大理石厅，

醒来后发现竟是真的；

我生在如今可谓不逢时，

史密斯呢？琼斯(8)呢？你呢？



西班牙内战和一九三六年至一九三七年间所发生的事改变了态势，此后我就知道我的立场如何。一九三六年以来，我所写的每一行严肃作品都是直接或者间接反对极权主义，支持我所理解的民主社会主义。在我们所处的这个时代，那种以为可以回避写这些题材的意见在我看来是无稽之谈。每个人都以这样那样的方式写它们，无非是简单的选择何种立场和用什么方式写的问题。一个人越清楚地认识到自己的政治倾向，就越可能达到既政治性地行事，又不牺牲自己在美学和思想上的诚实。

过去全部十年里，我最想做的，就是将政治性写作变成一种艺术。我的出发点总是有感于党派偏见和不公。动笔写一本书时，我不会跟自己说：“我要写一本完美的书。”我想写它，是因为我想揭穿某种谎言，想唤起人们注意某些事实。我最初关心的，就是让人们听到我的意见。但如果同时没有一种美学感受，我就不会写一本书，甚或为杂志写一篇长文。任何人如果有心详细读一下我写的东西，就会发现即使是纯粹的宣传，其中还是包括很多一个全职的政治家会认为跟主题无关的东西。我不能也不愿意完全抛弃我自孩提时期开始形成的世界观。只要我活着，就会继续追求文字上的风格，继续热爱大自然，继续乐于欣赏那些实实在在的东西，以及星星点点的无用信息。我想压制自己的这方面是徒劳的。我的工作，是将自己根深蒂固的好恶感与时代强加给我们所有人身上基本上是大众的、非个体的活动相调合。

这并非易事，它引出了结构及语言的难题，而且以新的方式引出了真实性的难题。我可以举例说明出现的基本困难。我那本关于西班牙内战的书《向加泰罗尼亚致敬》当然的确是政治性书本，但它主要是以一定的超脱心态和体例上的考虑写成的。我确实很努力地想在里面说清全部事实，又不与我的文学本能相悖。但除了别的，这本书中还包括篇幅很长的一章，里面全是引用报纸上的片断之类，是为托洛茨基主义者辩护的，他们被指控阴谋串通佛朗哥。很明显，再过一两年，任何普通读者都会对这样一章失去兴趣，必定将因此毁了这本书。一个我所尊敬的评论家给我上了一课：“你干吗要把那些玩意儿放进去？”他说，“你把本来不错的一本书变成了新闻报道。”他说得不错，可我只能这么做。我刚好知道清白的人们受到了不实的指控，而在英国只有极少数人有条件知道这一点。如果我不曾为之愤怒，就可能永远也不会写那本书。

这个问题还会以种种方式一再出现，而语言方面的问题与之相比更为微妙，讨论起来也需要太长时间。我只是要说近几年来，我一直在努力写得不那么栩栩如生，更追求准确性。不管怎样，我发现当你已经完美地形成任何一种写作风格时，你总是已经超越了这种风格。《动物庄园》是第一本我写作时对自己所做有完全清醒的认识，混合了政治目的和艺术目的的书。我有七年时间没写过长篇小说了，但我希望在不久的将来再写一部。它注定会失败，每本书都会失败，但我对要写什么样的书则多少已经心中有数。

回头看看前面的一两页，我看到写得似乎我的写作动机完全出自于热心公众利益，我不想让这成为别人对我的最终印象。凡是作家都自负自私，也是懒惰的，在他们各种写作动机的根子里面，还存在一个谜团。写本书是场可怕的、令人疲惫不堪的挣扎，就像很长一段时间得了令身心痛苦的病症。如果不是为某种他既无力抵抗又无法理解的魔鬼所驱使，他永远不会做起这样一件事。就人们所知，这个魔鬼只不过跟让小孩子号啕以引起别人注意的是同样一种本能。但同样正确的是，除非他不停奋力消除自己的个性，否则就写不出任何具有可读性的东西。好的文字就像窗玻璃。我不能十分肯定地说出我的几种动机里哪种最强，但我知道哪一种值得遵循。回头看看我的全部作品，我看到在我缺乏政治目的时，写出来的书总无一例外地没有生气，蜕化成华而不实的段落、无意义的句子和装饰性形容词，而且总的说来，是自欺欺人之作。

Volume One





Chapter One


It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.

The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.

Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.

Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.

Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.

Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste—this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.

The Ministry of Truth—Minitrue, in Newspeak(1) —was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:



WAR IS PEACE

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH



The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.

The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.

Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice spirit. Winston poured out nearly a tea cupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.

Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, where upon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful. He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover.

For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.

But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ("dealing on the free market", it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession.

The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forcedlabour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was of course impossible for his present purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:



April 4th, 1984.



He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.

For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word doublethink. For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him; or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.

For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin.

Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down. His small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops:



April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean. Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank. Then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. There was a middle-aged woman, might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms. Little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. Then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood. Then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out I don't suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what theproles say typical prole reaction they never—



Winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.

It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could be said to happen.

It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably—since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.

The other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming—in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief—or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope—that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away. A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.

The next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room. It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one's neck. The Hate had started.

As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even—so it was occasionally rumoured— in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.

Winston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army—row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.

Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne; besides, the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police. He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as the book. But one knew of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it.

In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The darkhaired girl behind Winston had begun crying out "Swine! Swine! Swine!" and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization.

It was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.

The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. Then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired, blackmoustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals:



WAR IS PEACE

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH



But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandyhaired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur that sounded like "My Saviour!" she extended her arms towards the screen. Then she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.

At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of "B-B! … B-B!" —over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first "B" and the second—a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise. Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of "B-B! … B-B!" always filled him with horror.

Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened—if, indeed, it did happen.

Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew—yes, he knew!—that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. "I am with you," O'Brien seemed to be saying to him. "I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don't worry, I am on your side!" And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's.

That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all—perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O'Brien again. The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live.

Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin was rising from his stomach.

His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. And it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals



DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER

DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER



over and over again, filling half a page.

He could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.

He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, made no difference. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go on with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just the same. He had committed—would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper—the essential crime that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.

It was always at night—the arrests invariably happened at night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished, annihilated; vaporized was the usual word.

For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl:



they'll shoot me I don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck I dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck I dont care down with big brother…



He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking at the door.

Already! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated. The worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got up and moved heavily towards the door.

Chapter Two


As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. It was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet.

He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside.

"Oh, comrade," she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, "I thought I heard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? It's got blocked up and—"

It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. ("Mrs" was a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party—you were supposed to call everyone "comrade" —but with some women one used it instinctively.) She was a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face. Winston followed her down the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation. Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.

"Of course it's only because Tom isn't home," said Mrs Parsons vaguely.

The Parsons' flat was bigger than Winston's, and dingy in a different way. Everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal. Games impedimenta — hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves. a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out—lay all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books. On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and a full-sized poster of Big Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which—one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say how was the sweat of some person not present at the moment. In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen.

"It's the children," said Mrs Parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance at the door. "They haven't been out today. And of course—"

She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.

"Of course if Tom was home he'd put it right in a moment," she said. "He loves anything like that. He's ever so good with his hands, Tom is."

Parsons was Winston's fellow-employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms—one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended. At thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the Sports Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary activities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every evening for the past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.

"Have you got a spanner?" — said Winston, fiddling with the nut on the angle-joint.

"A spanner," said Mrs Parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. "I don't know, I'm sure. Perhaps the children—"

There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the livingroom. Mrs Parsons brought the spanner. Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.

"Up with your hands!" yelled a savage voice.

A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister, about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood. Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy's demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.

"You're a traitor!" yelled the boy. "You're a thought-criminal! You're a Eurasian spy! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you, I'll send you to the salt mines!"

Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting "Traitor!" and "Thought-criminal!" the little girl imitating her brother in every movement. It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy's eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.

Mrs Parsons' eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back again. In the better light of the living-room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face.

"They do get so noisy," she said. "They're disappointed because they couldn't go to see the hanging, that's what it is. I'm too busy to take them. and Tom won't be back from work in time."

"Why can't we go and see the hanging?" roared the boy in his huge voice.

"Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!" chanted the little girl, still capering round.

Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered. This happened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see it. He took his leave of Mrs. Parsons and made for the door. But he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him. He spun round just in time to see Mrs. Parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.

"Goldstein!" bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman's greyish face.

Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the telescreen had stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress which had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands.

With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother—it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which The Times did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak— "child hero" was the phrase generally used—had overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.

The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again.

Years ago—how long was it? Seven years it must be—he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room. And someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed: "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness." It was said very quietly, almost casually—a statement, not a command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen O'Brien for the first time, nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as O'Brien's. But at any rate the identification existed. It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.

Winston had never been able to feel sure—even after this morning's flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.

"We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness," he had said. Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it would come true.

The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. The voice continued raspingly:

"Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrived from the Malabar front. Our forces in South India have won a glorious victory. I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. Here is the newsflash—"

Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough, following on a gory description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week, the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.

Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling. The telescreen—perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate— crashed into "Oceania, 'tis for thee". You were supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position he was invisible.

"Oceania, 'tis for thee" gave way to lighter music. Winston walked over to the window, keeping his back to the telescreen. The day was still cold and clear. Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating roar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at present.

Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Party would not endure for ever? Like an answer, the three slogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him:



WAR IS PEACE

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH



He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of Big Brother. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you. On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet—everywhere. Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed—no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.

The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was too strong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down. He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. For the future, for the past—for an age that might be imaginary. And in front of him there lay not death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. How could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?

The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten minutes. He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty.

Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him. He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:



To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone—to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone:

From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink—greetings !



He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the act itself. He wrote:



Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS death.



Now that he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained. It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some nosing zealot in the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired woman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had used an oldfashioned pen, what he had been writing—and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty darkbrown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose.

He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless to think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered. A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious. With the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved.





Chapter Three


Winston was dreaming of his mother.

He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearing spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties.

At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean place—the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave—but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards. They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight forever. He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things.

He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason. His mother's memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.

Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women's hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees.

The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time. Winston woke up with the word "Shakespeare" on his lips.

The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed—naked, for a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600—and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching.

"Thirty to forty group!" yapped a piercing female voice. "Thirty to forty group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!"

Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym-shoes, had already appeared.

"Arms bending and stretching!" she rapped out. "Take your time by me. One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it! One, two, three four! One two, three, four! …"

The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston's mind the impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been called London.

Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as they hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. His mother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. She was carrying his baby sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born then. Finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube station.

There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above the other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. He reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed to him that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved—a little granddaughter, perhaps had been killed. Every few minutes the old man kept repeating:

"We didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em. I said so, Ma, didn't I? That's what comes of trusting 'em. I said so all along. We didn't ought to 'ave trusted the buggers."

But which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted Winston could not now remember.

Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.

The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles) — the frightening thing was that it might all be true. If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened—that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?

The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. "Who controls the past," ran the Party slogan, "controls the future: who controls the present controls the past." And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. "Reality control", they called it: in Newspeak, "doublethink."

"Stand easy!" barked the instructress, a little more genially.

Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word "doublethink" involved the use of doublethink.

The instructress had called them to attention again. "And now let's see which of us can touch our toes!" she said enthusiastically. "Right over from the hips, please, comrades. One—two! One—two! … "

Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit. The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. Winston could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into existence. He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before 1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form—"English Socialism", that is to say—it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist. Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood. But you could prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact. And on that occasion—

"Smith!" screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. "6079 Smith W.! Yes, you! Bend lower, please! You can do better than that. You're not trying. Lower, please! That's better, comrade. Now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me."

A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston's body. His face remained completely inscrutable. Never show dismay! Never show resentment! A single flicker of the eyes could give you away. He stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head and—one could not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency—bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes.

"There, comrades! That's how I want to see you doing it. Watch me again. I'm thirty-nine and I've had four children. Now look." She bent over again. "You see my knees aren't bent. You can all do it if you want to," she added as she straightened herself up. "Anyone under forty-five is perfectly capable of touching his toes. We don't all have the privilege of fighting in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. Remember our boys on the Malabar front! And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses! Just think what they have to put up with. Now try again. That's better, comrade, that's much better," she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years.





Chapter Four


With the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started, Winston pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. Then he unrolled and clipped tog ether four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.

In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. To the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of Winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.

Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. Each contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated jargon—not actually Newspeak, but consisting largely of Newspeak words— which was used in the Ministry for internal purposes. They ran:



Times 17. 3. 84 bb speech malreported africa rectify

Times 19. 12. 83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issue

Times 14. 2. 84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify

Times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling



With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside. It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last. The other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.

Winston dialled "back numbers" on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of The Times, which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay. The messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. For example, it appeared from The Times of the seventeenth of March that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Command had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother's speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. Or again, The Times of the nineteenth of December had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a "categorical pledge" were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week. All that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.

As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of The Times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames.

What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of The Times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead. This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs—to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place. The largest section of the Records Department, far larger than the one on which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction. A number of The Times which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made. Even the written instructions which Winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy.

But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain.

Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named Tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston's direction.

Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed on. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs. In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate. He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbled versions—definitive texts, they were called—of poems which had become ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were the huge printing shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts, and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. There was the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall. There were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who coordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence.

And the Records Department, after all, was itself only a single branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen programmes, plays, novels—with every conceivable kind of information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child's spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. Here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. There was even a whole sub-section—Pornosec, it was called in Newspeak—engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no Party member, other than those who worked on it, was permitted to look at.

Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was working, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned to his cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his main job of the morning.

Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. Most of it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston was good at this kind of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of The Times leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak. He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. It ran:



times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling



In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:



The reporting of Big Brother's Order for the Day in The Times of December 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent persons. Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing.



Winston read through the offending article. Big Brother's Order for the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a prominent member of the Inner Party, had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration, the Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second Class.

Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given. One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen. That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. One never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some cases they might not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.

Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In the cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself. It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said. And presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select this version or that, would reedit it and set in motion the complex processes of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth.

Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced. Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps—what was likeliest of all—the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government. The only real clue lay in the words "refs unpersons", which indicated that Withers was already dead. You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested. Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed. Very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers, however, was already an unperson. He did not exist: he had never existed. Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother's speech. It was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject.

He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the Ninth Three-Year Plan, might complicate the records too much. What was needed was a piece of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready made as it were, the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order for the Day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy. It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence.

Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother's familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them ("What lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades? The lesson—which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc—that," etc., etc.), easy to imitate.

At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At six—a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules—he had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a troop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies. At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade which had been adopted by the Ministry of Peace and which, at its first trial, had killed thirtyone Eurasian prisoners in one burst. At twenty-three he had perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches and all—an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity and singlemindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life. He was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty. He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spies, saboteurs, thoughtcriminals, and traitors generally.

Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit; in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.

Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar.





Chapter Five


In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward. The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. From the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin. On the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.

"Just the man I was looking for," said a voice at Winston's back.

He turned round. It was his friend Syme, who worked in the Research Department. Perhaps "friend" was not exactly the right word. You did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others. Syme was a philologist, a specialist in Newspeak. Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. He was a tiny creature, smaller than Winston, with dark hair and large, protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you.

"I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades," he said.

"Not one!" said Winston with a sort of guilty haste. "I've tried all over the place. They don't exist any longer."

Everyone kept asking you for razor blades. Actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up. There had been a famine of them for months past. At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shops were unable to supply. Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. You could only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on the "free" market.

"I've been using the same blade for six weeks," he added untruthfully.

The queue gave another jerk forward. As they halted he turned and faced Syme again. Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter.

"Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?" said Syme.

"I was working," said Winston indifferently. "I shall see it on the flicks, I suppose."

"A very inadequate substitute," said Syme.

His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face. "I know you," the eyes seemed to say, "I see through you. I know very well why you didn't go to see those prisoners hanged." In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously orthodox. He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessions of thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love. Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on which he was authoritative and interesting. Winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.

"It was a good hanging," said Syme reminiscently. "I think it spoils it when they tie their feet together. I like to see them kicking. And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue a quite bright blue. That's the detail that appeals to me."

"Nex', please!" yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.

Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. On to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch—a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew, a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless Victory Coffee, and one saccharine tablet.

"There's a table over there, under that telescreen," said Syme. "Let's pick up a gin on the way."

The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. They threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. Winston took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the table at Winston's left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which pierced the general uproar of the room.

"How is the Dictionary getting on?" said Winston, raising his voice to overcome the noise.

"Slowly," said Syme. "I'm on the adjectives. It's fascinating."

He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak. He pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting.

"The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition," he said.

"We're getting the language into its final shape—the shape it's going to have when nobody speaks anything else. When we've finished with it, people like you will have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroying words—scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting the language down to the bone. The Eleventh Edition won't contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 2050."

He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then continued speaking, with a sort of pedant's passion. His thin dark face had become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy.

"It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take 'good', for instance. If you have a word like 'good', what need is there for a word like 'bad'? 'Ungood' will do just as well—better, because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of 'good', what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like 'excellent' and 'splendid' and all the rest of them? 'Plusgood' covers the meaning, or 'doubleplusgood' if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. But in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words—in reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was B.B.'s idea originally, of course," he added as an afterthought.

A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention of Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm.

"You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston," he said almost sadly. "Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak. I've read some of those pieces that you write in The Times occasionally. They're good enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stick to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning. You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?"

Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of the dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:

"Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point. But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime. It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak," he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. "Has it ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?"

"Except—" began Winston doubtfully, and he stopped.

It had been on the tip of his tongue to say "Except the proles," but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.

"The proles are not human beings," he said carelessly. "By 2050 earlier, probably—all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron—they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change. Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like 'freedom is slavery' when the concept of freedom has been abolished? The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking—not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness."

One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear. It is written in his face.

Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back to Winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said. From time to time Winston caught some such remark as "I think you're so right, I do so agree with you", uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department. He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once Winston caught a phrase— "complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism"— jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was just a noise, a quackquack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front-it made no difference. Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. It was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was his larynx. The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.

Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.

"There is a word in Newspeak," said Syme, "I don't know whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. It is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it is abuse, applied to someone you agree with, it is praise."

Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He thought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly wrong with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox. He believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut Tree Cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe, yet the place was somehow ill-omened. The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged. Goldstein himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. Syme's fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston's, secret opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought police. So would anybody else, for that matter: but Syme more than most. Zeal was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.

Syme looked up. "Here comes Parsons," he said.

Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, "that bloody fool". Parsons, Winston's fellow-tenant at Victory Mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room—a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face. At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. He greeted them both with a cheery "Hullo, hullo!" and sat down at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face. His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the Community Centre you could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his fingers.

"Look at him working away in the lunch hour," said Parsons, nudging Winston. "Keenness, eh? What's that you've got there, old boy? Something a bit too brainy for me, I expect. Smith, old boy, I'll tell you why I'm chasing you. It's that sub you forgot to give me."

"Which sub is that?" said Winston, automatically feeling for money. About a quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.

"For Hate Week. You know—the house-by-house fund. I'm treasurer for our block. We're making an all-out effort—going to put on a tremendous show. I tell you, it won't be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. Two dollars you promised me."

Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.

"By the way, old boy," he said. "I hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday. I gave him a good dressingdown for it. In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does it again."

"I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution," said Winston.

"Ah, well—what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it? Mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness! All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course. D'you know what that little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike out Berkhamsted way? She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. They kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when they got into Amersham, handed him over to the patrols."

"What did they do that for?" said Winston, somewhat taken aback. Parsons went on triumphantly:

"My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—might have been dropped by parachute, for instance. But here's the point, old boy. What do you think put her on to him in the first place? She spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoes—said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before. So the chances were he was a foreigner. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?"

"What happened to the man?" said Winston.

"Ah, that I couldn't say, of course. But I wouldn't be altogether surprised if—" Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion.

"Good," said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.

"Of course we can't afford to take chances," agreed Winston dutifully.

"What I mean to say, there is a war on," said Parsons.

As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads. However, it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.

"Comrades!" cried an eager youthful voice. "Attention, comrades! We have glorious news for you. We have won the battle for production! Returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past year. All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us. Here are some of the completed figures. Foodstuffs—"

The phrase "our new, happy life" recurred several times. It had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco. With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week. Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too—in some more complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory?

The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. As compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, more books, more babies—more of everything except disease, crime, and insanity. Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it always been like this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the canteen. A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient—nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. And though, of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness of one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes? Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different?

He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought Winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an ideal—tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree—existed and even predominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was curious how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the Party.

The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.

"The Ministry of Plenty's certainly done a good job this year," he said with a knowing shake of his head.

"By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?"

"Not one," said Winston. "I've been using the same blade for six weeks myself."

"Ah, well—just thought I'd ask you, old boy."

"Sorry," said Winston.

The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the Ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For some reason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. Within two years those children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston would be vaporized. O'Brien would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized. The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized. The little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department—she would never be vaporized either. It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for survival, it was not easy to say.

At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. The girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. It was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away again.

The sweat started out on Winston's backbone. A horrible pang of terror went through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following him about? Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so. Quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.

His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been looking at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control. It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in Newspeak: facecrime, it was called.

The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps after all she was not really following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work, if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket. Parsons had begun talking again.

"Did I ever tell you, old boy," he said, chuckling round the stem of his pipe, "about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market-woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of B.B.? Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches. Burned her quite badly, I believe. Little beggars, eh? But keen as mustard! That's a first-rate training they give them in the Spies nowadays—better than in my day, even. What d'you think's the latest thing they've served them out with? Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes! My little girl brought one home the other night—tried it out on our sitting-room door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole. Of course it's only a toy, mind you. Still, gives'em the right idea, eh?"

At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. It was the signal to return to work. All three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of Winston's cigarette.





Chapter Six


Winston was writing in his diary:



It was three years ago. It was on a dark evening, in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway stations. She was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. She had a young face, painted very thick. It was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. Party women never paint their faces. There was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens. She said two dollars. I—



For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window—to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him.

Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few metres apart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: That poor devil is done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.

He drew his breath and went on writing:



I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low. She—



His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to spit. Simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine, his wife. Winston was married—had been married, at any rate: probably he still was married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. Only the proles used scent. In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.

When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp: not more, if you had committed no other offence. And it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves. Some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink. Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members. But—though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to— it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.

The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose, and—though the principle was never clearly stated—permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another. The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from childhood onwards. There were even organizations such as the Junior Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. All children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (artsem, it was called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. This, Winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it. He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. And as far as the women were concerned, the Party's efforts were largely successful.

He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of her. For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married. They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children.

Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. Very early in her married life he had decided—though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people—that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered. She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her. "The human sound-track" he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing—sex.

As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting. It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate. But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this. They must, she said, produce a child if they could. So the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had two names for it. One was "making a baby", and the other was "our duty to the Party" (yes, she had actually used that phrase). Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. But luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they parted.

Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again and wrote:



She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt. I—



He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharine's white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party. Why did it always have to be like this? Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event. The women of the Party were all alike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty. By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them. His reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable, as the Party intended that they should be. And what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life. The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have awakened Katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was his wife.

But the rest of the story had got to be written down. He wrote:



I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light—



After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright. For the first time he could see the woman properly. He had taken a step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. If he went away without even doing what he had come here to do—!

It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old. The paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. She had no teeth at all.

He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:



When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.



He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He had written it down at last, but it made no difference. The therapy had not worked. The urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.





Chapter Seven


If there is hope, wrote Winston, it lies in the proles.

If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? And yet—!

He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices—women's voices—had burst from a side-street a little way ahead. It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud "Oh-o-o-o-oh!" that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. It's started! he had thought. A riot! The proles are breaking loose at last! When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stallkeeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another's hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. Winston watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?

He wrote:



Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.



That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles from bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six. But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. In reality very little was known about the proles. It was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty. Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them very little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was of no importance. In all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed upon them. Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was permitted. For that matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it. They were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it: "Proles and animals are free."

Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been like. He took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook which he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary:



In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution, London was not the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under. Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water.

But in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page. You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it.

The capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave. They owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to death. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as "Sir". The chief of all the capitalists was called the King. And—



But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o'-nine tails, the Lord Mayor's Banquet, and the practice of kissing the Pope's toe. There was also something called the jus primae noctis, which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories.

How could you tell how much of it was lies? It might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the Revolution. The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for a Party member, were neutral and nonpolitical, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.

He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations—that they lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago. Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed, for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate: before the Revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent. The Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300—and so it went on. It was like a single equation with two unknowns. It might very well be that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis, or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat.

Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth. Just once in his life he had possessed—after the event: that was what counted—concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification. He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds. In 1973, it must have been—at any rate, it was at about the time when he and Katharine had parted. But the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier.

The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out once and for all. By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brother himself. All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counter-revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes. Among the last survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. It must have been in 1965 that these three had been arrested. As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way. They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. All three had written long, abject articles in The Times, analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends.

Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. He remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. They were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother. But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. No one who had once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end. They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.

There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. It was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the Revolution. Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in The Times. They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. Always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes—slum tenements, starving children, street battles, capitalists in top hats—even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction. He seemed to be breaking up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling.

It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such a time. The place was almost empty. A tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with the pieces set out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something happened to the telescreens. The tune that they were playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. There came into it—but it was something hard to describe. It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston called it a yellow note. And then a voice from the telescreen was singing:



Under the spreading chestnut tree

I sold you and you sold me:

There lie they, and here lie we

Under the spreading chestnut tree.



The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford's ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.

A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release. At their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded in the Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance. It was a half-page torn out of The Times of about ten years earlier—the top half of the page, so that it included the date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom.

The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well. There was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.

Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at that time Winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory. It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known.

He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen.

He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance—would betray him. Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers. Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.

That was ten—eleven years ago. Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party's hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed?

But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at the time when he made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country. Since then there had been other changes—two, three, he could not remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance. The past not only changed, but changed continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken. The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:



I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.



He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. Atone time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, to believe that the past is inalterable. He might be alone in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also be wrong.

He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you—something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable what then?

But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. The face of O'Brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his mind. He knew, with more certainty than before, that O'Brien was on his side. He was writing the diary for O'Brien—to O'Brien: it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact.

The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the earth's centre. With the feeling that he was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote:



Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.





Chapter Eight


From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee—real coffee, not Victory Coffee—came floating out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cutoff the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.

He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked. In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed. It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak: ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But this evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable. On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again, losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going.

"If there is hope," he had written in the diary, "it lies in the proles." The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years' time, and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers. Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up. Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached.

"'Yes,' I say to 'er, 'that's all very well,' I says. 'But if you'd of been in my place you'd of done the same as what I done. It's easy to criticize,' I says, 'but you ain't got the same problems as what I got.'"

"Ah," said the other, "that's jest it. That's jest where it is."

The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostile silence as he went past. But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them. "May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?"—and so on and so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it.

Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were yells of warning from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky.

"Steamer!" he yelled. "Look out, guv'nor! Bang over 'ead! Lay downquick!"

"Steamer" was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered on to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window.

He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins. There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.

He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ("pubs", they called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder. Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces, Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows.

"Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say? I tell you no number ending in seven ain't won for over fourteen months!"

"Yes, it'as, then!"

"No, it'as not! Back 'ome I got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper. I takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. An' I tell you, no number ending in seven—"

"Yes, a seven 'as won! I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number. Four oh seven, it ended in. It were in February—second week in February."

"February your grandmother! I got it all down in black and white. An' I tell you, no number—"

"Oh, pack it in!" said the third man.

They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces. The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.

But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer's shop not faraway he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.

He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn, pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him. He would say to him: "Tell me about your life when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better than they are now, or were they worse?"

Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of course. As usual, there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not likely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume. Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses in their hands, were watching the scene.

"I arst you civil enough, didn't I?" said the old man, straightening his shoulders pugnaciously. "You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the 'hole bleeding boozer?"

"And what in hell's name is a pint?" said the barman, leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter.

"Ark at 'im! Calls itself a barman and don't know what a pint is! Why, a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon.' Ave to teach you the A, B, C next."

"Never heard of 'em," said the barman shortly. "Litre and half litre—that's all we serve. There's the glasses on the shelf in front of you."

"I likes a pint," persisted the old man. "You could 'a drawed me off a pint easy enough. We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man."

"When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops," said the barman, with a glance at the other customers.

There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry seemed to disappear. The old man's whitestubbled face had flushed pink. He turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston. Winston caught him gently by the arm.

"May I offer you a drink?" he said.

"You're a gent," said the other, straightening his shoulders again. He appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls. "Pint!" he added aggressively to the barman. "Pint of wallop."

The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was forgotten for a moment. There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard. It was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in.

"'E could 'a drawed me off a pint," grumbled the old man as he settled down behind a glass. "A 'alf litre ain't enough. It don't satisfy. And a 'ole litre's too much. It starts my bladder running. Let alone the price."

"You must have seen great changes since you were a young man," said Winston tentatively.

The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-room that he expected the changes to have occurred.

"The beer was better," he said finally. "And cheaper! When I was a young man, mild beer—wallop we used to call it—was fourpence a pint. That was before the war, of course."

"Which war was that?" said Winston.

"It's all wars," said the old man vaguely. He took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again. "Ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth!"

In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam's apple made a surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. Winston went to the bar and came back with two more half-litres. The old man appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full litre.

"You are very much older than I am," said Winston. "You must have been a grown man before I was born. You can remember what it was like in the old days, before the Revolution. People of my age don't really know anything about those times. We can only read about them in books, and what it says in the books may not be true. I should like your opinion on that. The history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands—the capitalists, they were called—who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was to own. They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they wore top hats—"

The old man brightened suddenly.

"Top 'ats!" he said. "Funny you should mention 'em. The same thing come into my 'ead only yesterday, I dono why. I was jest thinking, I ain't seen a top 'at in years. Gorn right out, they 'ave. The last time I wore one was at my sister-in-law's funeral. And that was—well, I couldn't give you the date, but it must'a been fifty years ago. Of course it was only 'ired for the occasion, you understand. "

"It isn't very important about the top hats," said Winston patiently. "The point is, these capitalists—they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—were the lords of the earth. Everything existed for their benefit. You—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves. They could do what they liked with you. They could ship you off to Canada like cattle. They could sleep with your daughters if they chose. They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine tails. You had to take your cap off when you passed them. Every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who— "

The old man brightened again.

"Lackeys!" he said. "Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long. Lackeys! That reg'lar takes me back, that does. I recollect oh, donkey's years ago—I used to sometimes go to 'Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to 'ear the blokes making speeches. Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indians—all sorts there was. And there was one bloke—well, I couldn't give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was. 'E didn't 'alf give it 'em! 'Lackeys!' 'e says, 'lackeys of the bourgeoisie! Flunkies of the ruling class!—' Parasites—that was another of them. And 'yenas—'e definitely called 'em 'yenas. Of course 'e was referring to the Labour Party, you understand. "

Winston had the feeling that they were talking at crosspurposes.

"What I really wanted to know was this," he said. "Do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days? Are you treated more like a human being? In the old days, the rich people, the people at the top—"

"The 'Ouse of Lords," put in the old man reminiscently.

"The House of Lords, if you like. What I am asking is, were these people able to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and you were poor? Is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them 'Sir' and take off your cap when you passed them?"

The old man appeared to think deeply. He drank off about a quarter of his beer before answering.

"Yes," he said. "They liked you to touch your cap to 'em. It showed respect, like. I didn't agree with it, myself, but I done it often enough. Had to, as you might say."

"And was it usual—I'm only quoting what I've read in history books—was it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter?"

"One of 'em pushed me once," said the old man. "I recollect it as if it was yesterday. It was Boat Race night—terribly rowdy they used to get on Boat Race night—and I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue. Quite a gent, 'e was—dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'E was kind of zig-zagging across the pavement, and I bumps into 'im accidental-like. 'E says, 'Why can't you look where you're going?' 'e says. I say, 'Ju think you've bought the bleeding pavement?' 'E says, 'I'll twist your bloody 'ead off if you get fresh with me.' I says, 'You're drunk. I'll give you in charge in 'alf a minute,' I says. An' if you'll believe me, 'e puts 'is 'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus. Well, I was young in them days, and I was going to 'ave fetched 'im one, only—"

A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old man's memory was nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all day without getting any real information. The party histories might still be true, after a fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last attempt.

"Perhaps I have not made myself clear," he said. "What I'm trying to say is this. You have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life before the Revolution. In 1925, for instance, you were already grown up. Would you say from what you can remember, that life in 1925 was better than it is now, or worse? If you could choose, would you prefer to live then or now?"

The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He finished up his beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.

"I know what you expect me to say," he said. "You expect me to say as I'd sooner be young again. Most people'd say they'd sooner be young, if you arst' 'em. You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young. When you get to my time of life you ain't never well. I suffer something wicked from my feet, and my bladder's jest terrible. Six and seven times a night it 'as me out of bed. On the other 'and, there's great advantages in being a old man. You ain't got the same worries. No truck with women, and that's a great thing. I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd credit it. Nor wanted to, what's more."

Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no use going on. He was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question, "Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?" would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and written records were falsified—when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.

At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. He halted and looked up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He seemed to know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop where he had bought the diary.

A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. With the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he stepped through the doorway. If questioned, he could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades.

The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles.

"I recognized you on the pavement," he said immediately. "You're the gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album. That was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. Cream-laid, it used to be called. There's been no paper like that made for—oh, I dare say fifty years." He peered at Winston over the top of his spectacles. "Is there anything special I can do for you? Or did you just want to look round?"

"I was passing," said Winston vaguely. "I just looked in. I don't want anything in particular."

"It's just as well," said the other, "because I don't suppose I could have satisfied you." He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand. "You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, the antique trade's just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock either. Furniture, china, glass it's all been broken up by degrees. And of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. I haven't seen a brass candlestick in years."

The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The floorspace was very restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on as mall table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends—lacquered snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like—which looked as though they might include something interesting. As Winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight, and he picked it up.

It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone.

"What is it?" said Winston, fascinated.

"That's coral, that is," said the old man. "It must have come from the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the glass. That wasn't made less than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of it."

"It's a beautiful thing," said Winston.

"It is a beautiful thing," said the other appreciatively. "But there's not many that'd say so nowadays." He coughed. "Now, if it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that'd cost you four dollars. I can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was—well, I can't work it out, but it was a lot of money. But who cares about genuine antiques nowadays even the few that's left?"

Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two.

"There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at," he said. "There's not much in it. Just a few pieces. We'll do with a light if we're going upstairs."

He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly armchair drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it.

"We lived here till my wife died," said the old man half apologetically. "I'm selling the furniture off by little and little. Now that's a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it. But I dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome."

He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.

"There's no telescreen!" he could not help murmuring.

"Ah," said the old man, "I never had one of those things. Too expensive. And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. Now that's a nice gateleg table in the corner there. Though of course you'd have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps."

There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The hunting-down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed.

"Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all—" he began delicately.

Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. There was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.

"The frame's fixed to the wall," said the old man, "but I could unscrew it for you, I dare say."

"I know that building," said Winston finally. "It's a ruin now. It's in the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice."

"That's right. Outside the Law Courts. It was bombed in—oh, many years ago. It was a church at one time, St Clement Danes, its name was." He smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and added: "Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!"

"What's that?" said Winston.

"Oh— 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's.' That was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I don't remember, but I do know it ended up, 'Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chop off your head.' It was a kind of a dance. They held out their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to 'Here comes a chopper to chop off your head' they brought their arms down and caught you. It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it—all the principal ones, that is."

Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large and impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value. One could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the names of streets—anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered.

"I never knew it had been a church," he said.

"There's a lot of them left, really," said the old man, "though they've been put to other uses. Now, how did that rhyme go? Ah! I've got it!



Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,

You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's—



There, now, that's as far as I can get. A farthing, that was a small copper coin, looked something like a cent."

"Where was St Martin's?" said Winston.

"St Martin's? That's still standing. It's in Victory Square, alongside the picture gallery. A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps."

Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds—scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.

"St Martin's-in-the-Fields it used to be called," supplemented the old man, "though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts."

Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not Weeks—as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shop-front—but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. Throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head. Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing.

He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitering the street before stepping out of the door. He had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval—a month, say—he would take the risk of visiting the shop again. It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre. The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place, after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted. However—!

Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes, take it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington's memory. Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five seconds' exaltation made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window. He had even started humming to an improvised tune:



Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,

You owe me three farthings, say the—



Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. A figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him.

For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived. It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough that she was watching him. Probably she had seen him go into the pub as well.

It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.

The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his steps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.

It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. The lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.

It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so. Many of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and certain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed. He might have silenced the darkhaired girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one's own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.

He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The woman on the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien, for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed was what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth, and bloody clots of hair.

Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time?

He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of O'Brien. "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness," O'Brien had said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that of O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache? Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:



WAR IS PEACE

FREEDOM IS SLAVERY

IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH





Volume Two





Chapter One


It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory.

A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junkshop. As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were "roughed in". It was a common accident in the Fiction Department.

They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.

A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.

"You're hurt?" he said.

"It's nothing. My arm. It'll be all right in a second."

She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had certainly turned very pale.

"You haven't broken anything?"

"No, I'm all right. It hurt for a moment, that's all." She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. She had regained some of her colour, and appeared very much better.

"It's nothing," she repeated shortly. "I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang. Thanks, comrade!"

And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going, as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no question that she had done it intentionally. It was something small and flat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.

While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously.

He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him. "Five minutes," he told himself, "five minutes at the very least!" His heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing close attention.

Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. But there was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come from the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organization. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it! No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a couple of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to him. And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death—still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite.

He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of paper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large unformed handwriting:



I love you.



For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once again, just to make sure that the words were really there.

For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. What was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a fire were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen was torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week. He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-ma'che model of Big Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by his daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in that direction again.

The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under a cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried off to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a "discussion group", played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled "Ingsoc in relation to chess". His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twentythree hours, when he was home and in bed—in the darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent—that he was able to think continuously.

It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but that was of no importance. He thought of her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you. Actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think, he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments on a table.

Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might have been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going there. If he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work, he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few people ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not know the girl's name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round—if these conditions endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words.

For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having already blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift. They passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He did not touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him.

The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full. The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds would do it. Then a voice behind him called, "Smith!" He pretended not to hear. "Smith!" repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round. A blond-headed, sillyfaced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not safe to refuse. After having been recognized, he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it. The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.

But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely enough, she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl's table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston followed. It was no use unless he could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendous crash. The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl's table.

He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating. It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by since she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must have changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should end successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston began speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices.

"What time do you leave work?"

"Eighteen-thirty."

"Where can we meet?"

"Victory Square, near the monument."

"It's full of telescreens."

"It doesn't matter if there's a crowd."

"Any signal?"

"No. Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. And don't look at me. Just keep somewhere near me."

"What time?"

"Nineteen hours."

"All right."

Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table. They did not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. The girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to smoke a cigarette.

Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother's statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian aeroplanes (the East Asian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared. Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she had changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin's Church, whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed "You owe me three farthings." Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. It was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There were telescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.

Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of the girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he had broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.

A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machine guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street. In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clankclank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons. Truckload after truck-load of the sad faces passed. Winston knew they were there but he saw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks.

"Can you hear me?"

"Yes."

"Can you get Sunday afternoon off?"

"Yes."

"Then listen carefully. You'll have to remember this. Go to Paddington Station—"

With a sort of military precision that astonished him, she outlined the route that he was to follow. A halfhour railway journey; turn left outside the station; two kilometres along the road: a gate with the top bar missing; a path across a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead tree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside her head. "Can you remember all that?" she murmured finally.

"Yes."

"You turn left, then right, then left again. And the gate's got no top bar."

"Yes. What time?"

"About fifteen. You may have to wait. I'll get there by another way. Are you sure you remember everything?"

"Yes."

"Then get away from me as quick as you can."

She need not have told him that. But for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were still filing past, the people still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boos and hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners, whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. One literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as war-criminals: the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labour camps. The round Mongol faces had given way to faces of a more European type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into Winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them bound together. It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part. But at the last moment, while the crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze.

It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detail of her hand. He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the workhardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the wrist. Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl's eyes were. They were probably brown, but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of hair.





Chapter Two


Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to kiss one's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves.

He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties about the journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention. For distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who examined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkward questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of the summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon with "in-laws" in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston, to get hold of a little blackmarket butter.

The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch, but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began picking some partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best thing to do. It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To look round was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell lightly on his shoulder.

He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed, still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back after all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him. Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apart the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston followed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. The girl stopped and turned.

"Here we are," she said.

He was facing her at several paces' distance. As yet he did not dare move nearer to her.

"I didn't want to say anything in the lane," she went on, "in case there's a mike hidden there. I don't suppose there is, but there could be. There's always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. We're all right here."

He still had not the courage to approach her. "We're all right here?" he repeated stupidly.

"Yes. Look at the trees." They were small ashes, which at some time had been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles, none of them thicker than one's wrist. "There's nothing big enough to hide a mike in. Besides, I've been here before."

They were only making conversation. He had managed to move closer to her now. She stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act. The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to have fallen of their own accord. He took her hand.

"Would you believe," he said, "that till this moment I didn't know what colour your eyes were?" They were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of brown, with dark lashes. "Now that you've seen what I'm really like, can you still bear to look at me?"

"Yes, easily."

"I'm thirty-nine years old. I've got a wife that I can't get rid of. I've got varicose veins. I've got five false teeth."

"I couldn't care less," said the girl.

The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his arms. At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthful body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down on to the ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her. But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without women—he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round his waist.

"Never mind, dear. There's no hurry. We've got the whole afternoon. Isn't this a splendid hide-out? I found it when I got lost once on a community hike. If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away."

"What is your name?" said Winston.

"Julia. I know yours. It's Winston—Winston Smith."

"How did you find that out?"

"I expect I'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. Tell me, what did you think of me before that day I gave you the note?"

He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. It was even a sort of love-offering to start off by telling the worst.

"I hated the sight of you," he said. "I wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards. Two weeks ago I thought seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone. If you really want to know, I imagined that you had something to do with the Thought Police."

The girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as a tribute to the excellence of her disguise.

"Not the Thought Police! You didn't honestly think that?"

"Well, perhaps not exactly that. But from your general appearance—merely because you're young and fresh and healthy, you understand—I thought that probably—"

"You thought I was a good Party member. Pure in word and deed. Banners, processions, slogans, games, community hikes all that stuff. And you thought that if I had a quarter of a chance I'd denounce you as a thought-criminal and get you killed off?"

"Yes, something of that kind. A great many young girls are like that, you know."

"It's this bloody thing that does it," she said, ripping off the scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging it on to a bough. Then, as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. Chocolate normally was dullbrown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was powerful and troubling.

"Where did you get this stuff?" he said.

"Black market," she said indifferently. "Actually I am that sort of girl, to look at. I'm good at games. I was a troop-leader in the Spies. I do voluntary work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti-Sex League. Hours and hours I've spent pasting their bloody rot all over London. I always carry one end of a banner in the processions. I always look cheerful and I never shirk anything. Always yell with the crowd, that's what I say. It's the only way to be safe."

The first fragment of chocolate had melted on Winston's tongue. The taste was delightful. But there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. He pushed it away from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not.

"You are very young," he said. "You are ten or fifteen years younger than I am. What could you see to attract you in a man like me?"

"It was something in your face. I thought I'd take a chance. I'm good at spotting people who don't belong. As soon as I saw you I knew you were against them."

Them, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner Party, about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy, although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere. A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language. Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention the Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways, and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay. They had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not speak above a whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better to go quietly. Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. She stopped him.

"Don't go out into the open. There might be someone watching. We're all right if we keep behind the boughs."

They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The sunlight, filtering through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. Winston looked out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, closebitten pasture, with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women's hair. Surely somewhere nearby, but out of sight, there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming?

"Isn't there a stream somewhere near here?" he whispered.

"That's right, there is a stream. It's at the edge of the next field, actually. There are fish in it, great big ones. You can watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails."

"It's the Golden Country—almost," he murmured.

"The Golden Country?"

"It's nothing, really. A landscape I've seen sometimes in a dream."

"Look!" whispered Julia.

A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small, beetle-like man was listening intently—listening to that. But by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped thinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body seemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings.

Winston put his lips against her ear. "Now," he whispered.

"Not here," she whispered back. "Come back to the hide-out. It's safer."

Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way back to the clearing. When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him. They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant, then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. Her body gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body; his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile. He knelt down before her and took her hands in his.

"Have you done this before?"

"Of course. Hundreds of times—well scores of times anyway."

"With Party members."

"Yes, always with Party members."

"With members of the Inner Party?"

"Not with those swine, no. But there's plenty that would if they got half a chance. They're not so holy as they make out."

His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been hundreds—thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing iniquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine! He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face.

"Listen. The more men you've had, the more I love you. Do you understand that?"

"Yes, perfectly."

"I hate purity, I hate goodness! I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere. I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones."

"Well then, I ought to suit you, dear. I'm corrupt to the bones."

"You like doing this? I don't mean simply me: I mean the thing in itself?"

"I adore it."

That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces. He pressed her down upon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no difficulty. Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The sun seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her. Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour.

Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freckled face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. Except for her mouth, you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes, if you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft. It occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived.

The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite comeback. He pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it was desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.





Chapter Three


"We can come here once again," said Julia. "It's generally safe to use any hide-out twice. But not for another month or two, of course."

As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She became alert and business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed natural to leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London, stored away from innumerable community hikes. The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come, and brought him out at a different railway station. "Never go home the same way as you went out," she said, as though enunciating an important general principle. She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half an hour before following her.

She had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings hence. It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing-thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition. But with luck, in the middle of the crowd, it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting.

"And now I must go," she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions. "I'm due back at nineteenthirty. I've got to put in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League, handing out leaflets, or something. Isn't it bloody? Give me a brush-down, would you? Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are you sure? Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!"

She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise. Even now he had not found out her surname or her address. However, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication.

As it happened, they never went back to the clearing in the wood. During the month of May there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love. That was in another hidingplace known to Julia, the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very dangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without introduction on the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation, which she called "talking by instalments". She was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They were passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was dead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips. Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.

There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. Even if it had been less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet. Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free. She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior Anti-Sex League, preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings campaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it was camouflage. If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even induced Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party members. So, one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.

When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up. It was a blazing afternoon. The air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming.

Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with thirty other girls ("Always in the stink of women! How I hate women!" she said parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the Fiction Department. She enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor. She was "not clever", but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel, from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the final touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not interested in the finished product. She "didn't much care for reading," she said. Books were just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.

She had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the Revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. At school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running. She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti-Sex League. She had always borne an excellent character. She had even (an infallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House by the people who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like Spanking Stories or One Night in a Girls School, to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal.

"What are these books like?" said Winston curiously.

"Oh, ghastly rubbish. They're boring, really. They only have six plots, but they swap them round a bit. Of course I was only on the kaleidoscopes. I was never in the Rewrite Squad. I'm not literary, dear—not even enough for that."

He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Pornosec, except the heads of the departments, were girls. The theory was that men, whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.

"They don't even like having married women there," she added. "Girls are always supposed to be so pure. Here's one who isn't, anyway."

She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a Party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. "And a good job too," said Julia, "otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he confessed." Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw it was quite simple. You wanted a good time; "they", meaning the Party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. She seemed to think it just as natural that "they" should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. She hated the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general criticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard of the Brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. Any kind of organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure, struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as something unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.

They did not discuss the possibility of getting married. It was too remote to be worth thinking about. No imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if Katharine, Winston's wife, could somehow have been got rid of. It was hopeless even as a daydream.

"What was she like, your wife?" said Julia.

"She was—do you know the Newspeak word goodthinkful? Meaning naturally orthodox, incapable of thinking a bad thought?"

"No, I didn't know the word, but I know the kind of person, right enough."

He began telling her the story of his married life, but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already. She described to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of Katharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength, even when her arms were clasped tightly round him. With Julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things: Katharine, in any case, had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one.

"I could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing," he said. He told her about the frigid little ceremony that Katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week. "She hated it, but nothing would make her stop doing it. She used to call it—but you'll never guess."

"Our duty to the Party," said Julia promptly.

"How did you know that?"

"I've been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for the over-sixteens. And in the Youth Movement. They rub it into you for years. I dare say it works in a lot of cases. But of course you can never tell; people are such hypocrites."

She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia, everything came back to her own sexuality. As soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way she put it was:

"When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don't give a damn for anything. They can't bear you to feel like that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?"

That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connection between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.

Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine would un-questionably have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia of something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.

It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at the bottom. There was nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she realized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy. To be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them. One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brickred, apparently growing on the same root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called to Katharine to come and look at it.

"Look, Katharine! Look at those flowers. That clump down near the bottom. Do you see they're two different colours?"

She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back for a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was pointing. He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on her waist to steady her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, not a leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was a microphone it would only pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his face. And the thought struck him…

"Why didn't you give her a good shove?" said Julia. "I would have."

"Yes, dear, you would have. I would, if I'd been the same person then as I am now. Or perhaps I would—I'm not certain."

"Are you sorry you didn't?"

"Yes. On the whole I'm sorry I didn't."

They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. He pulled her closer against him. Her head rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung. She was very young, he thought, she still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing.

"Actually it would have made no difference," he said.

"Then why are you sorry you didn't do it?"

"Only because I prefer a positive to a negative. In this game that we're playing, we can't win. Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds, that's all."

He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated. In a way she realized that she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose. All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. She did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse.

"We are the dead," he said.

"We're not dead yet," said Julia prosaically.

"Not physically. Six months, a year—five years, conceivably. I am afraid of death. You are young, so presumably you're more afraid of it than I am. Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. But it makes very little difference. So long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same thing."

"Oh, rubbish! Which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? Don't you enjoy being alive? Don't you like feeling: This is me, this is my hand, this is my leg, I'm real, I'm solid, I'm alive! Don't you like this?"

She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him. He could feel her breasts, ripe yet firm, through her overalls. Her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth and vigour into his. "Yes, I like that," he said.

"Then stop talking about dying. And now listen, dear, we've got to fix up about the next time we meet. We may as well go back to the place in the wood. We've given it a good long rest. But you must get there by a different way this time. I've got it all planned out. You take the train—but look, I'll draw it out for you."

And in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust, and with a twig from a pigeon's nest began drawing a map on the floor.





Chapter Four


Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's shop. Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, the glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness.

In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets. The clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen-twenty really. She was coming at nineteen-thirty.

Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly. Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit, this one was the least possible to conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him. Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love-affair. Instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. And when they had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to the house, one of them through the back yard, which gave on an alley.

Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain. The June sun was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothesline, pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized as babies' diapers. Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto:



It was only an 'opeless fancy.

It passed like an Ipril dye,

But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred!

They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!



The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub-section of the Music Department. The words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator. But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound. He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street, and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen.

Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. But the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own, indoors and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings. Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody. Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day. They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. On the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly looked at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.

"It's all off," she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak. "Tomorrow, I mean."

"What?"

"Tomorrow afternoon. I can't come."

"Why not?"

"Oh, the usual reason. It's started early this time."

For a moment he was violently angry. During the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had been simply an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. She had become a physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she said that she could not come, he had the feeling that she was cheating him. But just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they were a married couple of ten years' standing. He wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household. He wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the following day, that the idea of renting Mr. Charrington's room had occurred to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love. It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, wilful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.

At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. Julia burst into the room. She was carrying a toolbag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partly because she was still holding the tool-bag.

"Half a second," she said. "Just let me show you what I've brought. Did you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee? I thought you would. You can chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. Look here."

She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. Underneath were a number of neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. It was filled with some kind of heavy, sand-like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it.

"It isn't sugar?" he said.

"Real sugar. Not saccharine, sugar. And here's a loaf of bread proper white bread, not our bloody stuff—and a little pot of jam. And here's a tin of milk—but look! This is the one I'm really proud of. I had to wrap a bit of sacking round it, because—"

But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. The smell was already filling the room, a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with even now, blowing down a passage-way before a door slammed, or diffusing itself mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lost again.

"It's coffee," he murmured, "real coffee."

"It's Inner Party coffee. There's a whole kilo here," she said.

"How did you manage to get hold of all these things?"

"It's all Inner Party stuff. There's nothing those swine don't have, nothing. But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things, and—look, I got a little packet of tea as well."

Winston had squatted down beside her. He tore open a corner of the packet.

"It's real tea. Not blackberry leaves."

"There's been a lot of tea about lately. They've captured India, or something," she said vaguely. "But listen, dear. I want you to turn your back on me for three minutes. Go and sit on the other side of the bed. Don't go too near the window. And don't turn round till I tell you."

Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. Down in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and the line. She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling:



They sye that time 'eals all things,

They sye you can always forget;

But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years

They twist my 'eart-strings yet!



She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it seemed. Her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort of happy melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers and singing rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself. Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about.

"You can turn round now," said Julia.

He turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. What he had actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not naked. The transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. She had painted her face.

She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of make-up materials. Her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully done, but Winston's standards in such matters were not high. He had never before seen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The improvement in her appearance was startling. With just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above all, far more feminine. Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness of a basement kitchen, and a woman's cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter.

"Scent too!" he said.

"Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I'm going to do next? I'm going to get hold of a real woman's frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers. I'll wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! In this room I'm going to be a woman, not a Party comrade."

They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. It was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence. Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them. "It's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?" said Julia. One never saw a double bed nowadays, except in the homes of the proles. Winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood: Julia had never been in one before, so far as she could remember.

Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When Winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not stir, because Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.

"Half that water's boiled away," she said. "I'll get up and make some coffee in another moment. We've got an hour. What time do they cut the lights off at your flats?"

"Twenty-three thirty."

"It's twenty-three at the hostel. But you have to get in earlier than that, because—Hi! Get out, you filthy brute!"

She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor, and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her fling the dictionary at Goldstein, that morning during the Two Minutes Hate.

"What was it?" he said in surprise.

"A rat. I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. There's a hole down there. I gave him a good fright, anyway."

"Rats!" murmured Winston. "In this room!"

"They're all over the place," said Julia indifferently as she lay down again. "We've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. Some parts of London are swarming with them. Did you know they attack children? Yes, they do. In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for two minutes. It's the great huge brown ones that do it. And the nasty thing is that the brutes always—"

"Don't go on!" said Winston, with his eyes tightly shut.

"Dearest! You've gone quite pale. What's the matter? Do they make you feel sick?"

"Of all horrors in the world—a rat!"

She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body. He did not reopen his eyes immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of beingback in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was always very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness, and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too dreadful to be faced. In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self- deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He always woke up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with what Julia had been saying when he cut her short.

"I'm sorry," he said, "it's nothing. I don't like rats, that's all."

"Don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here. I'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. And next time we come here I'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly."

Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. What was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine. With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other, Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light. He took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft, rainwatery appearance of the glass.

"What is it, do you think?" said Julia.

"I don't think it's anything—I mean, I don't think it was ever put to any use. That's what I like about it. It's a little chunk of history that they've forgotten to alter. It's a message from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it."

"And that picture over there"—she nodded at the engraving on the opposite wall— "would that be a hundred years old?"

"More. Two hundred, I dare say. One can't tell. It's impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays."

She went over to look at it. "Here's where that brute stuck his nose out," she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture. "What is this place? I've seen it before somewhere."

"It's a church, or at least it used to be. St Clement Danes its name was." The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught him came back into his head, and he added half-nostalgically: "Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's!"

To his astonishment she capped the line:

"You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's, When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey—"

"I can't remember how it goes on after that. But anyway I remember it ends up, 'Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!'"

It was like the two halves of a countersign. But there must be another line after "the bells of Old Bailey". Perhaps it could be dug out of Mr Charrington's memory, if he were suitably prompted.

"Who taught you that?" he said.

"My grandfather. He used to say it to me when I was a little girl. He was vaporized when I was eight—at any rate, he disappeared. I wonder what a lemon was," she added inconsequently. "I've seen oranges. They're a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin."

"I can remember lemons," said Winston. "They were quite common in the fifties. They were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them."

"I bet that picture's got bugs behind it," said Julia. "I'll take it down and give it a good clean some day. I suppose it's almost time we were leaving. I must start washing this paint off. What a bore! I'll get the lipstick off your face afterwards."

Winston did not get up for a few minutes more. The room was darkening. He turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight. The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it was almost as transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was Julia's life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.





Chapter Five


Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing from work: a few thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobody mentioned him. On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of the Records Department to look at the notice-board. One of the notices carried a printed list of the members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had been one. It looked almost exactly as it had looked before—nothing had been crossed out—but it was one name shorter. It was enough. Syme had ceased to exist: he had never existed.

The weather was baking hot. In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless, air-conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature, but outside the pavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was a horror. The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing, and the staffs of all the Ministries were working overtime. Processions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays, film shows, telescreen programmes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs faked. Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets. Winston, in addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day in going through back files of The Times and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at night, when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. The rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumours.

The new tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate Week (the Hate Song, it was called) had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens. It had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. The proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competed with the still-popular "It was only a hopeless fancy". The Parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and apiece of toilet paper. Winston's evenings were fuller than ever. Squads of volunteers, organized by Parsons, were preparing the street for Hate Week, stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers. Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display four hundred metres of bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as a lark. The heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings. He was everywhere at once, pushing, pulling, sawing, hammering, improvising, jollying everyone along with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat.

A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It had no caption, and represented simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier, three or four metres high, striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whatever angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by the foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. The thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother. The proles, normally apathetic about the war, were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism. As though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual. One fell on a crowded film theatre in Stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. The whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting. Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces. There were further angry demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished of suffocation.

In the room over Mr. Charrington's shop, when they could get there, Julia and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window, naked for the sake of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean, the room was paradise. As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes, and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack.

Four, five, six—seven times they met during the month of June. Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed to have lost the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. Now that they had a secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time. What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. To know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The room was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk. Mr. Charrington, thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usually stopped to talk with Mr. Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs. The old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other hand to have almost no customers. He led a ghostlike existence between the tiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity to talk. Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman. With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that—a china bottlestopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby's hair—never asking that Winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. To talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical-box. He had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes. There was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poor Cock Robin. "It just occurred to me you might be interested," he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment. But he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme.

Both of them knew—in a way, it was never out of their minds that what was now happening could not last long. There were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking. But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence. So long as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them. Getting there was difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. Or Katharine would die, and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and Julia would succeed in getting married. Or they would commit suicide together. Or they would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live out their lives undetected in a back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew. In reality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available.

Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the Party, but with no notion of how to take the first step. Even if the fabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty of finding one's way into it. He told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and O'Brien, and of the impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O'Brien's presence, announce that he was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough, this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes. Moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that widespread, organized opposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein and his underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in. Times beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief. When public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals "Death to the traitors!" During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at Goldstein. Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent. She had grown up since the Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination: and in any case the Party was invincible. It would always exist, and it would always be the same. You could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.

In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and far less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connection to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, "just to keep people frightened". This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him. She also stirred a sort of envy in himby telling him that during the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing. But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having learnt it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own schooldays, Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later, when Julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) And when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. After all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham: but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed. "I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia," she said vaguely. It frightened him a little. The invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth, but the switchover in the war had happened only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as unimportant. "Who cares?" she said impatiently. "It's always one bloody war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway."

Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent forgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to horrify her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers. It did not make much impression on her. At first, indeed, she failed to grasp the point of the story.

"Were they friends of yours?" she said.

"No, I never knew them. They were Inner Party members. Besides, they were far older men than I was. They belonged to the old days, before the Revolution. I barely knew them by sight."

"Then what was there to worry about? People are being killed off all the time, aren't they?"

He tried to make her understand. "This was an exceptional case. It wasn't just a question of somebody being killed. Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Just in that one instance, in my whole life, I did possess actual concrete evidence after the event—years after it."

"And what good was that?"

"It was no good, because I threw it away a few minutes later. But if the same thing happened today, I should keep it."

"Well, I wouldn't!" said Julia. "I'm quite ready to take risks, but only for something worth while, not for bits of old newspaper. What could you have done with it even if you had kept it?"

"Not much, perhaps. But it was evidence. It might have planted a few doubts here and there, supposing that I'd dared to show it to anybody. I don't imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. But one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there—small groups of people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off."

"I'm not interested in the next generation, dear. I'm interested in us."

"You're only a rebel from the waist downwards," he told her.

She thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight.

In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest. Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past, and the denial of objective reality, and to use Newspeak words, she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing. One knew that it was all rubbish, so why let oneself be worried by it? She knew when to cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed. If he persisted in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position. Talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.





Chapter Six


It had happened at last. The expected message had come. All his life, it seemed to him, he had been waiting for this to happen.

He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almost at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. The person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to speaking. Winston stopped abruptly and turned. It was O'Brien.

At last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away. His heart bounded violently. He would have been incapable of speaking. O'Brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement, laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston's arm, so that the two of them were walking side by side. He began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members.

"I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you," he said. "I was reading one of your Newspeak articles in The Times the other day. You take a scholarly interest in Newspeak, I believe?"

Winston had recovered part of his self-possession. "Hardly scholarly," he said. "I'm only an amateur. It's not my subject. I have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language."

"But you write it very elegantly," said O'Brien. "That is not only my own opinion. I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert. His name has slipped my memory for the moment."

Again Winston's heart stirred painfully. It was inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference to Syme. But Syme was not only dead, he was abolished, an unperson. Any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous. O'Brien's remark must obviously have been intended as a signal, a codeword. By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices. They had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor, but now O'Brien halted. With the curious, disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose. Then he went on:

"What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed you had used two words which have become obsolete. But they have only become so very recently. Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary?"

"No," said Winston. "I didn't think it had been issued yet. We are still using the ninth in the Records Department."

"The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, I believe. But a few advance copies have been circulated. I have one myself. It might interest you to look at it, perhaps?"

"Very much so," said Winston, immediately seeing where this tended.

"Some of the new developments are most ingenious. The reduction in the number of verbs—that is the point that will appeal to you, I think. Let me see, shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary? But I am afraid I invariably forget anything of that kind. Perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you? Wait. Let me give you my address."

They were standing in front of a telescreen. Somewhat absentmindedly O'Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered notebook and a gold ink-pencil. Immediately beneath the telescreen, in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore out the page and handed it to Winston.

"I am usually at home in the evenings," he said. "If not, my servant will give you the dictionary."

He was gone, leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time there was no need to conceal. Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers.

They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most. There was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have. It had been contrived as a way of letting Winston know O'Brien's address. This was necessary, because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to discover where anyone lived. There were no directories of any kind. "If you ever want to see me, this is where I can be found," was what O'Brien had been saying to him. Perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary. But at any rate, one thing was certain. The conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer edges of it.

He knew that sooner or later he would obey O'Brien's summons. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay—he was not certain. What was happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago. The first step had been a secret, involuntary thought, the second had been the opening of the diary. He had moved from thoughts to words, and now from words to actions. The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of Love. He had accepted it. The end was contained in the beginning. But it was frightening: or, more exactly, it was like a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. Even while he was speaking to O'Brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him.





Chapter Seven


Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. Julia rolled sleepily against him, murmuring something that might have been "What's the matter?"

"I dreamt—" he began, and stopped short. It was too complex to be put into words. There was the dream itself, and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking.

He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain. It had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances. The dream had also been comprehended by—indeed, in some sense it had consisted in—a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopter blew them both to pieces.

"Do you know," he said, "that until this moment I believed I had murdered my mother?"

"Why did you murder her?" said Julia, almost asleep.

"I didn't murder her. Not physically."

In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother, and within a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all come back. It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his consciousness over many years. He was not certain of the date, but he could not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had happened.

His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much earlier he could not remember. He remembered better the rackety, uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering in Tube stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour, the enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance—above all, the fact that there was never enough to eat. He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted over the bad patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.

When his father disappeared, his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change came over her. She seemed to have become completely spiritless. It was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen. She did everything that was needed—cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece—always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an artist's lay-figure moving of its own accord. Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. For hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made simian by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything. He was aware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen.

He remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. There was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He remembered his mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. He would ask his mother naggingly, over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share. His mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. She took it for granted that he, "the boy", should have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. At every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister's plate. He knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a right to do it. The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf.

One day a chocolate-ration was issued. There had been no such issue for weeks or months past. He remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were listening to somebody else, Winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. His mother told him not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston, giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winston stood watching her for a moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeing for the door.

"Winston, Winston!" his mother called after him. "Come back! Give your sister back her chocolate!"

He stopped, but did not come back. His mother's anxious eyes were fixed on his face. Even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening. His sister, conscious of having been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. His mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned and fled down the stairs. with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand.

He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother had disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister. They had not taken any clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. To this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead. It was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As for his sister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the colonies for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called)which had grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or other to die.

The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. His mind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy white quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water.

He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance. Without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position.

"I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days," she said indistinctly. "All children are swine."

"Yes. But the real point of the story—"

From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again. He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones. Her feelings were her own, and could not be altered from outside. It would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When once you were in the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream of history. And yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself. The proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this condition. They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed human. They had not become hardened inside. They had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort. And in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk.

"The proles are human beings," he said aloud. "We are not human."

"Why not?" said Julia, who had woken up again.

He thought for a little while. "Has it ever occurred to you," he said, "that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before it's too late, and never see each other again?"

"Yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. But I'm not going to do it, all the same."

"We've been lucky," he said "but it can't last much longer. You're young. You look normal and innocent. If you keep clear of people like me, you might stay alive for another fifty years."

"No. I've thought it all out. What you do, I'm going to do. And don't be too downhearted. I'm rather good at staying alive."

"We may be together for another six months—a year—there's no knowing. At the end we're certain to be apart. Do you realize how utterly alone we shall be? When once they get hold of us there will be nothing, literally nothing, that either of us can do for the other. If I confess, they'll shoot you, and if I refuse to confess, they'll shoot you just the same. Nothing that I can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will put off your death for as much as five minutes. Neither of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead. We shall be utterly without power of any kind. The one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray one another, although even that can't make the slightest difference."

"If you mean confessing," she said, "we shall do that, right enough. Everybody always confesses. You can't help it. They torture you."

"I don't mean confessing. Confession is not betrayal. What you say or do doesn't matter: only feelings matter. If they could make me stop loving you—that would be the real betrayal."

She thought it over. "They can't do that," she said finally. "It's the one thing they can't do. They can make you say anything—any-thing—but they can't make you believe it. They can't get inside you."

"No," he said a little more hopefully, "no; that's quite true. They can't get inside you. If you can feel that staying human is worth while, even when it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them."

He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands. One did not know what happened inside the Ministry of Love, but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning. Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. They could be tracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately make? They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.





Chapter Eight


They had done it, they had done it at last!

The room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit. The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet. At the far end of the room O'Brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of papers on either side of him. He had not bothered to look up when the servant showed Julia and Winston in.

Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak. They had done it, they had done it at last, was all he could think. It had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on O'Brien's doorstep. But merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve. It was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling-places of the Inner Party, or even penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived. The whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro—everything was intimidating. Although he had a good pretext for cominghere, he was haunted at every step by the fear that a blackuniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner, demand his papers, and order him to get out. O'Brien's servant, however, had admitted the two of them without demur. He was a small, dark-haired man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless face which might have been that of a Chinese. The passage down which he led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. That too was intimidating. Winston could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies.

O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying it intently. His heavy face, bent down so that one could see the line of the nose, looked both formidable and intelligent. For perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring. Then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries:

"Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end message."

He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the soundless carpet. A little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the Newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. The terror that Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment. It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake. For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was any kind of political conspirator? Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark: beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on a dream. He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary, because in that case Julia's presence was impossible to explain. As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him. He stopped, turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall. There was a sharp snap. The voice had stopped.

Julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. Even in the midst of his panic, Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue.

"You can turn it off!" he said.

"Yes," said O'Brien, "we can turn it off. We have that privilege."

He was opposite them now. His solid form towered over the pair of them, and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was waiting, somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's. Then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile. With his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettled his spectacles on his nose.

"Shall I say it, or will you?" he said.

"I will say it," said Winston promptly. "That thing is really turned off?"

"Yes, everything is turned off. We are alone."

"We have come here because—"

He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from O'Brien, it was not easy to say why he had come here. He went on, conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious:

"We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secret organization working against the Party, and that you are involved in it. We want to join it and work for it. We are enemies of the Party. We disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc. We are thought-criminals. We are also adulterers. I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy. If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way, we are ready."

He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come in without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses.

"Martin is one of us," said O'Brien impassively. "Bring the drinks over here, Martin. Put them on the round table. Have we enough chairs? Then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. Bring a chair for yourself, Martin. This is business. You can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes."

The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man's whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment. O'Brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding—a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen from the top the stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity.

"It is called wine," said O'Brien with a faint smile. "You will have read about it in books, no doubt. Not much of it gets to the Outer Party, I am afraid." His face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: "I think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. To our Leader: To Emmanuel Goldstein."

Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington's half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. Actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. The truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it. He set down the empty glass.

"Then there is such a person as Goldstein?" he said.

"Yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. Where, I do not know."

"And the conspiracy—the organization? Is it real? It is not simply an invention of the Thought Police?"

"No, it is real. The Brotherhood, we call it. You will never learn much more about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it. I will come back to that presently." He looked at his wrist-watch. "It is unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour. You ought not to have come here together, and you will have to leave separately. You, comrade"—he bowed his head to Julia—"will leave first. We have about twenty minutes at our disposal. You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions. In general terms, what are you prepared to do?"

"Anything that we are capable of," said Winston.

O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing Winston. He almost ignored Julia, seeming to take it for granted that Winston could speak for her. For a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes. He began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers were known to him already.

"You are prepared to give your lives?"

"Yes."

"You are prepared to commit murder?"

"Yes."

"To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people?"

"Yes."

"To betray your country to foreign powers?"

"Yes."

"You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the minds of children, to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases—to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the Party?"

"Yes."

"If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child's face—are you prepared to do that?"

"Yes."

"You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dock-worker?"

"Yes."

"You are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?"

"Yes."

"You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another again?"

"No!" broke in Julia.

It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered. For a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. His tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word, then of the other, over and over again. Until he had said it, he did not know which word he was going to say. "No," he said finally.

"You did well to tell me," said O'Brien. "It is necessary for us to know everything."

He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it:

"Do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different person? We may be obliged to give him a new identity. His face, his movements, the shape of his hands, the colour of his hair—even his voice would be different. And you yourself might have to become a different person. Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. Sometimes it is necessary. Sometimes we even amputate a limb."

Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's Mongolian face. There were no scars that he could see. Julia had turned a shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced O'Brien boldly. She murmured something that seemed to be assent.

"Good. Then that is settled."

There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. With a rather absent-minded air O'Brien pushed them towards the others, took one himself, then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think better standing. They were very good cigarettes, very thick and well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. O'Brien looked at his wrist-watch again.

"You had better go back to your Pantry, Martin," he said. "I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour. Take a good look at these comrades' faces before you go. You will be seeing them again. I may not."

Exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes flickered over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner. He was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in them, or appeared to feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. Without speaking or giving any kind of salutation, Martin went out, closing the door silently behind him. O'Brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette.

"You understand," he said, "that you will be fighting in the dark. You will always be in the dark. You will receive orders and you will obey them, without knowing why. Later I shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which we shall destroy it. When you have read the book, you will be full members of the Brotherhood. But between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. I tell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. You will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear. As this was your first contact, it will be preserved. When you receive orders, they will come from me. If we find it necessary to communicate with you, it will be through Martin. When you are finally caught, you will confess. That is unavoidable. But you will have very little to confess, other than your own actions. You will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people. Probably you will not even betray me. By that time I may be dead, or I shall have become a different person, with a different face."

He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. In spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. It came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. However much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the singlemindedness that belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease, amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage. "This is unavoidable," his voice seemed to say; "this is what we have got to do, unflinchingly. But this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again." A wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out from Winston towards O'Brien. For the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of Goldstein. When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders and his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated. There was no stratagem that he was not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. Even Julia seemed to be impressed. She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently. O'Brien went on:

"You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt you have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages on walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand. Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others. Goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police, could not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would lead them to a complete list. No such list exists. The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense. Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible. You will never have anything to sustain you, except the idea. You will get no comradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are caught, you will get no help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. You will have to get used to living without results and without hope. You will work for a while, you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. Those are the only results that you will ever see. There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how far away that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little. We cannot act collectively. We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after generation. In the face of the Thought Police there is no other way."

He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist-watch.

"It is almost time for you to leave, comrade," he said to Julia. "Wait. The decanter is still half full."

He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem.

"What shall it be this time?" he said, still with the same faint suggestion of irony. "To the confusion of the Thought Police? To the death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the future?"

"To the past," said Winston.

"The past is more important," agreed O'Brien gravely. They emptied their glasses, and a moment later Julia stood up to go. O'Brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. It was important, he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very observant. As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence. He took another pace or two up and down, then stopped.

"There are details to be settled," he said. "I assume that you have a hiding-place of some kind?"

Winston explained about the room over Mr Charrington's shop.

"That will do for the moment. Later we will arrange something else for you. It is important to change one's hiding-place frequently. Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of the book"—even O'Brien, Winston noticed, seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italics——"Goldstein's book, you understand, as soon as possible. It may be some days before I can get hold of one. There are not many in existence, as you can imagine. The Thought Police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them. It makes very little difference. The book is indestructible. If the last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word for word. Do you carry a brief-case to work with you?" he added.

"As a rule, yes."

"What is it like?"

"Black, very shabby. With two straps."

"Black, two straps, very shabby—good. One day in the fairly near future—I cannot give a date—one of the messages among your morning's work will contain a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for a repeat. On the following day you will go to work without your brief-case. At some time during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the arm and say "I think you have dropped your brief-case." The one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein's book. You will return it within fourteen days."

They were silent for a moment.

"There are a couple of minutes before you need go," said O'Brien. "We shall meet again—if we do meet again—"

Winston looked up at him. "In the place where there is no darkness?" he said hesitantly.

O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise. "In the place where there is no darkness," he said, as though he had recognized the allusion. "And in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave? Any message? Any question?"

Winston thought. There did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding generalities. Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien or the Brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room over Mr. Charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame. Almost at random he said:

"Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins 'Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's'?" Again O'Brien nodded. With a sort of grave courtesy he completed the stanza:



"Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's,

You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's,

When will you pay me? say the bells of Old Bailey.

When I grow rich, say the bells of Shoreditch."



"You knew the last line!" said Winston.

"Yes, I knew the last line. And now, I am afraid, it is time for you to go. But wait. You had better let me give you one of these tablets."

As Winston stood up O'Brien held out a hand. His powerful grip crushed the bones of Winston's palm. At the door Winston looked back, but O'Brien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. He was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. Beyond him Winston could see the writing-table with its green-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers. The incident was closed. Within thirty seconds, it occurred to him, O'Brien would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party.





Chapter Nine


Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was the right word. It had come into his head spontaneously. His body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magnified. His overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet, even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak.

He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So had everyone else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, no Party work of any description, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six hours in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction of Mr. Charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him. The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg. Inside it was the book, which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened, nor even looked at.

On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions, the speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming of guns—after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces—at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was an ally.

There was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. Merely it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it happened. It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit. The square was packed with several thousand people, including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the Inner Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A little Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker's hand. He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different. Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd. Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous commotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. The Spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was all over. The orator, still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed.

The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, "Excuse me, I think you've dropped your brief-case." He took the brief-case abstractedly, without speaking. He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it. The instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the Ministry of Truth, though the time was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, were hardly necessary.

Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs—all had to be rectified at lightning speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known that the chiefs of the Department intended that within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia, or the alliance with Eastasia, should remain inexistence anywhere. The work was overwhelming, all the more so because the processes that it involved could not be called by their true names. Everyone in the Records Department worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two threehour snatches of sleep. Mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen. Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawled back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work. What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical. Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable.

By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes. It was like struggling with some crushing physical task, something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to remember it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was as anxious as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be perfect. On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down. For as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing. Everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off. A deep and as it were secret sigh went through the Department. A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had been achieved. It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened. At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the Ministry were free till tomorrow morning. Winston, still carrying the brief-case containing the book, which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his body while he slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in his bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.

With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above Mr Charrington's shop. He was tired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee. Julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. He sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.

A heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the cover. The print also looked slightly irregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through many hands. The inscription on the title-page ran:





THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OFOLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM


by Emmanuel Goldstein

Winston began reading:





Chapter I

Ignorance is Strength


Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.

The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable…



Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety. He was alone: no telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. From somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock. He settled deeper into the arm-chair and put his feet up on the fender. It was bliss, it was eternity. Suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word, he opened it at a different place and found himself at Chapter III. He went on reading:





Chapter Ⅲ

War is Peace


The splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and Oceania, were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. The frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands including the British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa. Eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier, comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.

In one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. War, however, is no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century. It is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference. This is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy, meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths. War has in fact changed its character. More exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of importance. Motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon.

To understand the nature of the present war—for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war—one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. None of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces. Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about. With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labour power. Between the frontiers of the super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area. Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment.

All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods. But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever power controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or Southern India, or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies. The inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas. The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo and the northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and Eastasia is never stable; round the Pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored: but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the territory which forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate. Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to the world's economy. They add nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which towage another war. By their labour the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist, the structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself, would not be essentially different.

The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work. The world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the vision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient—a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete—was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing. This failed to happen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and various devices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage, have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped, and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process—by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute—the machine did raise the living standards of the average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.

But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction—indeed, in some sense was the destruction—of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance. To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals.

Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare.

The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargoships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bareneeds of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call "the proles". The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.

War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society. What is concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even the humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should exist. The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his capacity as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink. Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with Oceania the undisputed master of the entire world.

All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet. In Oceania at the present day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for "Science". The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are cultivated with horseploughs while books are written by machinery. But in matters of vital importance—meaning, in effect, war and police espionage—the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least tolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. In so far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter. The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor, studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost islands of the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship; others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth's centre.

But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others. What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about ten years later. At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western Europe, and North America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society, and hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later. And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years. Helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating Fortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use. And in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks, have never been repeated.

None of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all three powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following, is the same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization. Moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the Equator and the Pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken. This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all three super-states. It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate. It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs.

Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps better rendered as Obliteration of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense. Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable, and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all. Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary, so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three sheaves of corn. And, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. Their lives are dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory. Meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought. Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character.

In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. In the past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency. So long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be serious. Physical facts could not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four. Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past. Newspapers and history books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.

But when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous. When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity. Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded. As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important. Efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police. Since each of the three super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised. Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life—the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death, and between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a distinction, but that is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose.

The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word "war", therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This—although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense—is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: War is Peace.



Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude and safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. In a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already. He had just turned back to Chapter I when he heard Julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her. She dumped her brown tool-bag on the floor and flung herself into his arms. It was more than a week since they had seen one another.

"I've got the book," he said as they disentangled themselves.

"Oh, you've got it? Good," she said without much interest, and almost immediately knelt down beside the oilstove to make the coffee.

They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour. The evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane. From below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones. The brawny red-armed woman whom Winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. There seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song. Julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. He reached out for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against the bedhead.

"We must read it," he said. "You too. All members of the Brotherhood have to read it."

"You read it," she said with her eyes shut. "Read it aloud. That's the best way. Then you can explain it to me as you go."

The clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen. They had three or four hours ahead of them. He propped the book against his knees and began reading:





Chapter I

Ignorance is Strength


Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.



"Julia, are you awake?" said Winston.

"Yes, my love, I'm listening. Go on. It's marvellous."

He continued reading:



The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.

By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change. In the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always made use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however, the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. In the past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand. Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned. The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia, Death-Worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality. These new movements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology. But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more, and then stop. As usual, the High were to be turned out by the Middle, who would then become the High; but this time, by conscious strategy, the High would be able to maintain their position permanently.

The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history was now intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it was alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible. It was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable. Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machine production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels. Therefore, from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted. In more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it. The idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The heirs of the French, English, and American revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent. But by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years—imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations-not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive.

It was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government. As compared with their opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. This last difference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were halfhearted and inefficient. The ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance. The invention of print, however, made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio carried the process further. With the development of television, and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of communication closed. The possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time.

After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the new High group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. The so-called "abolition of private property" which took place in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals. Individually, no member of the Party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. Collectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, because it controls everything, and disposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years following the Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization. It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated, Socialism must follow: and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated. Factories, mines, land, houses, transport—everything had been taken away from them: and since these things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be public property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been made permanent.

But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power. Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree. A ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. Ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself.

After the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality disappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert. The second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. The recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political results, because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate. As for the problem of overproduction, which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare (see Chapter III), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch. From the point of view of our present rulers, therefore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able, underemployed, powerhungry people, and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational. It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it. The consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way.

Given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already, the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the pyramid comes Big Brother. Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every success, every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen Big Brother. He is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen. We may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big Brother is the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His function is to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization. Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party, its numbers limited to six millions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described as the brain of the State, may be justly likened to the hands. Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as "the proles", numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population. In the terms of our earlier classification, the proles are the Low: for the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure.

In principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary. The child of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party. Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. Nor is there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination of one province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the Party, and the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. Oceania has no capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chief lingua franca and Newspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers are not held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It is true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines. There is far less to-and-fro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the pre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the Party. The most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated. But this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat. In the crucial years, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition. The older kind of Socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called "class privilege" assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent. He did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same.

All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the Party and prevent the true nature of presentday society from being perceived. Physical rebellion, or any preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present not possible. From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party member, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated.

A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police. Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone. Wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected. Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships, his relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children, the expression of his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of his body, are all jealously scrutinized. Not only any actual misdemeanour, but any eccentricity, however small, any change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected. He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. On the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceania there is no law. Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future. A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions, but the right instincts. Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (in Newspeak a goodthinker), he will in all circumstances know, without taking thought, what is the true belief or the desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate mental training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the Newspeak words crimestop, blackwhite, and doublethink, makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever.

A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and selfabasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children, is called, in Newspeak, crimestop. Crimestop means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity is not enough. On the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body. Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink.

The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary reason is that the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising. But by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party. It is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one's mind, or even one's policy, is a confession of weakness. If, for example, Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always have been the enemy. And if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered. Thus history is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day falsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love.

The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc. Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it. It also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specific instance. For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no different past can ever have existed. This holds good even when, as often happens, the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now. It will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory. To make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act. But it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner. And if it is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written records, then it is necessary to forget that one has done so. The trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique. It is learned by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, "reality control". In Newspeak it is called doublethink, though doublethink comprises much else as well.

Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. Doublethink lies at the very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies—all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the Party has been able—and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years—to arrest the course of history.

All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft. Either they became stupid and arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; or they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have used force, and once again were overthrown. They fell, that is to say, either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is the achievement of the Party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party be made permanent. If one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one's own infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.

It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating. In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. In general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane. One clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale. Those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories. To these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them. They are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightly more favoured workers whom we call "the proles" are only intermittently conscious of the war. When it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm is found. World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible. This peculiar linking-together of opposites—knowledge with ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism—is one of the chief distinguishing marks of Oceanic society. The official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no practical reason for them. Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it chooses to do this in the name of Socialism. It preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past, and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason. It systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names of the four Ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts. The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy; they are deliberate exercises in doublethink. For it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely. In no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. If human equality is to be for ever averted—if the High, as we have called them, are to keep their places permanently—then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity.

But there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored. It is; why should human equality be averted? Supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for this huge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time?

Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen. the mystique of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, depends upon doublethink. But deeper than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink, the Thought Police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards. This motive really consists…



Winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been very still for some time past. She was lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly.

"Julia."

No answer.

"Julia, are you awake?"

No answer. She was asleep. He shut the book, put it carefully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of them.

He had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. He understood how; he did not understand why. Chapter I, like Chapter III, had not actually told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already. But after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad. A yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow. He shut his eyes. The sun on his face and the girl's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy, confident feeling. He was safe, everything was all right. He fell asleep murmuring "Sanity is not statistical," with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom.





Chapter Ten


When he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only twenty-thirty. He lay dozing for a while; then the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard below:



It was only an 'opeless fancy,

It passed like an Ipril dye,

But a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred,

They 'ave stolen my 'eart awye!



The driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity. You still heard it all over the place. It had outlived the Hate Song. Julia woke at the sound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.

"I'm hungry," she said. "Let's make some more coffee. Damn! The stove's gone out and the water's cold." She picked the stove up and shook it. "There's no oil in it."

"We can get some from old Charrington, I expect."

"The funny thing is I made sure it was full. I'm going to put my clothes on," she added. "It seems to have got colder."

Winston also got up and dressed himself. The indefatigable voice sang on:



They sye that time 'eals all things,

They sye you can always forget;

But the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years'

They twist my 'eart-strings yet!



As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window. The sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. The flagstones were wet as though they had just been washed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower?

"She's beautiful," he murmured.

"She's a metre across the hips, easily," said Julia.

"That is her style of beauty," said Winston.

He held Julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm. From the hip to the knee her flank was against his. Out of their bodies no child would ever come. That was the one thing they could never do. Only by word of mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. The woman down there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile belly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It might easily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still singing. The mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into interminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were also very much the same—everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another's existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same—people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles! Without having read to the end of the book, he knew that that must be Goldstein's final message. The future belonged to the proles. And could he be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes, because at the least it would be a world of sanity. Where there is equality there can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strength would change into consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill.

"Do you remember," he said, "the thrush that sang to us, that first day, at the edge of the wood?"

"He wasn't singing to us," said Julia. "He was singing to please himself. Not even that. He was just singing."

The birds sang, the proles sang; the Party did not sing. All round the world, in London and New York, in Africa and Brazil, and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of Paris and Berlin, in the villages of the endless Russian plain, in the bazaars of China and Japan—everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and still singing. Out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come. You were the dead, theirs was the future. But you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four.

"We are the dead," he said.

"We are the dead," echoed Julia dutifully.

"You are the dead," said an iron voice behind them. They sprang apart. Winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice. He could see the white all round the irises of Julia's eyes. Her face had turned a milky yellow. The smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath.

"You are the dead," repeated the iron voice.

"It was behind the picture," breathed Julia.

"It was behind the picture," said the voice. "Remain exactly where you are. Make no movement until you are ordered."

It was starting, it was starting at last! They could do nothing except stand gazing into one another's eyes. To run for life, to get out of the house before it was too late—no such thought occurred to them. Unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall. There was a snap as though a catch had been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. The picture had fallen to the floor uncovering the telescreen behind it.

"Now they can see us," said Julia.

"Now we can see you," said the voice. "Stand out in the middle of the room. Stand back to back. Clasp your hands behind your heads. Do not touch one another."

They were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel Julia's body shaking. Or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. He could just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control. There was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside. The yard seemed to be full of men. Something was being dragged across the stones. The woman's singing had stopped abruptly. There was a long, rolling clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain.

"The house is surrounded," said Winston.

"The house is surrounded," said the voice.

He heard Julia snap her teeth together. "I suppose we may as well say good-bye," she said.

"You may as well say good-bye," said the voice. And then another quite different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which Winston had the impression of having heard before, struck in; "And by the way, while we are on the subject, 'Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head'!"

Something crashed on to the bed behind Winston's back. The head of a ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. Someone was climbing through the window. There was a stampede of boots up the stairs. The room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands.

Winston was not trembling any longer. Even his eyes he barely moved. One thing alone mattered; to keep still, to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! A man with a smooth prizefighter's jowl in which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite him balancing his truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger. Winston met his eyes. The feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. The man protruded the tip of a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, and then passed on. There was another crash. Someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearth-stone.

The fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. How small, thought Winston, how small it always was! There was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. One of the men had smashed his fist into Julia's solar plexus, doubling her up like a pocket ruler. She was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre, but sometimes her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath. He knew what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack. Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw of her.

He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his mind. He wondered whether they had got Mr. Charrington. He wondered what they had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three hours ago. He noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one. But the light seemed too strong. Would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an August evening? He wondered whether after all he and Julia had mistaken the time—had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further. It was not interesting.

There was another, lighter step in the passage. Mr Charrington came into the room. The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington's appearance. His eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.

"Pick up those pieces," he said sharply.

A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had disappeared; Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. Mr. Charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He was still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. His body had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. His face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation. The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. It was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred to Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge, at a member of the Thought Police.





Volume Three





Chapter One


He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the Ministry of Love, but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.

There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But he was also hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be twenty-four hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know, probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.

He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for food was growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread. He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls. It was even possible—he thought this because from time to time something seemed to tickle his leg—that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. In the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slipped a hand into his pocket.

"Smith!" yelled a voice from the telescreen. "6079 Smith W.! Hands out of pockets in the cells!"

He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. The majority of them were common criminals, but there were a few political prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards, fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed to be on good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle them roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent. It was "all right" in the camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the common criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.

There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description: drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes. Some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across Winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of "F—bastards!" Then, noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston's knees on to the bench.

"Beg pardon, dearie," she said. "I wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggers put me there. They dono 'ow to treat a lady, do they?" She paused, patted her breast, and belched. "Pardon," she said, "I ain't meself, quite."

She leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor.

"Thass better," she said, leaning back with closed eyes. "Never keep it down, thass what I say. Get it up while it's fresh on your stomach, like."

She revived, turned to have another look at Winston and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him towards her, breathing beer and vomit into his face.

"Wass your name, dearie?" she said.

"Smith," said Winston.

"Smith?" said the woman. "Thass funny. My name's Smith too. Why," she added sentimentally, "I might be your mother!"

She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was about the right age and physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-labour camp.

No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent the ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners. "The polits," they called them, with a sort of uninterested contempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. Only once, when two Party members, both women, were pressed close together on the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedlywhispered words; and in particular a reference to something called "room one-ohone", which he did not understand.

It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. The dull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. He felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved her and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered what was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering hope. O'Brien might know that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood, he had said, never tried to save its members. But there was the razor blade; they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, which shrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it.

Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always lost count at some point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what time of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O'Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows. His cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.

There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel door opened with a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straightfeatured face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door clanged shut again.

Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and then began to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston's presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days away from a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements.

Winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. He must speak to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was even conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.

"Ampleforth," he said.

There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth paused, mildly startled. His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.

"Ah, Smith!" he said. "You too!"

"What are you in for?"

"To tell you the truth—" He sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite Winston. "There is only one offence, is there not?" he said.

"And have you committed it?"

"Apparently I have."

He put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, as though trying to remember something.

"These things happen," he began vaguely. "I have been able to recall one instance—a possible instance. It was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. We were producing a definitive edition of the poems of Kipling. I allowed the word 'God' to remain at the end of a line. I could not help it!" he added almost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. "It was impossible to change the line. The rhyme was 'rod'. Do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to 'rod' in the entire language? For days I had racked my brains. There was no other rhyme."

The expression on his face changed. The annoyance passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the dirt and scrubby hair.

"Has it ever occurred to you," he said, "that the whole history of English poetry has been determined by the fact that the English language lacks rhymes?"

No, that particular thought had never occurred to Winston. Nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting.

"Do you know what time of day it is?" he said.

Ampleforth looked startled again. "I had hardly thought about it. They arrested me—it could be two days ago—perhaps three." His eyes flitted round the walls, as though he half expected to find a window somewhere. "There is no difference between night and day in this place. I do not see how one can calculate the time."

They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one knee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still. Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour—it was difficult to judge. Once more there was a sound of boots outside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon, very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come.

The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell. With a brief movement of the hand he indicated Ampleforth.

"Room 101," he said.

Ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending.

What seemed like a long time passed. The pain in Winston's belly had revived. His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; O'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in his entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. As the door opened, the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. Parsons walked into the cell. He was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.

This time Winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.

"You here!" he said.

Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor surprise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look, as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance.

"What are you in for?" said Winston.

"Thoughtcrime!" said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be applied to himself. He paused opposite Winston and began eagerly appealing to him: "You don't think they'll shoot me, do you, old chap? They don't shoot you if you haven't actually done anything—only thoughts, which you can't help? I know they give you a fair hearing. Oh, I trust them for that! They'll know my record, won't they? You know what kind of chap I was. Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of course, but keen. I tried to do my best for the Party, didn't I? I'll get off with five years, don't you think? Or even ten years? A chap like me could make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp. They wouldn't shoot me for going off the rails just once?"

"Are you guilty?" said Winston.

"Of course I'm guilty!" cried Parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen. "You don't think the Party would arrest an innocent man, do you?" His frog-like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression. "Thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man," he said sententiously. "It's insidious. It can get hold of you without your even knowing it. Do you know how it got hold of me? In my sleep! Yes, that's a fact. There I was, working away, trying to do my bit—never knew I had any bad stuff in my mind at all. And then I started talking in my sleep. Do you know what they heard me saying?"

He sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter an obscenity.

"'Down with Big Brother!' Yes, I said that! Said it over and over again, it seems. Between you and me, old man, I'm glad they got me before it went any further. Do you know what I'm going to say to them when I go up before the tribunal? 'Thank you,' I'm going to say, 'thank you for saving me before it was too late.'"

"Who denounced you?" said Winston.

"It was my little daughter," said Parsons with a sort of doleful pride. "She listened at the keyhole. Heard what I was saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day. Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh? I don't bear her any grudge for it. In fact I'm proud of her. It shows I brought her up in the right spirit, anyway."

He made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan. Then he suddenly ripped down his shorts.

"Excuse me, old man," he said. "I can't help it. It's the waiting."

He plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. Winston covered his face with his hands.

"Smith!" yelled the voice from the telescreen. "6079 Smith W.! Uncover your face. No faces covered in the cells."

Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory, loudly and abundantly. It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards.

Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went, mysteriously. One, a woman, was consigned to "Room 101", and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a different colour when she heard the words. A time came when, if it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There were six prisoners in the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston there sat a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large, harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there. His pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone's eye.

The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent a momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace, mean-looking man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But what was startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or something.

The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winston did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation. The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell. There was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. The eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up, waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-faced man.

There was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. The chinless man jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands behind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift.

"Bumstead!" roared the voice. "2713 Bumstead J.! Let fall that piece of bread!"

The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor.

"Remain standing where you are," said the voice. "Face the door. Make no movement."

The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the young officer entered and stepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man, and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man's mouth. The force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. His body was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat. For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed unconscious, came out of him. Then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.

The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. The chinless man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face the flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass with a black hole in the middle of it.

From time to time a little blood dripped on to the breast of his overalls. His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever, as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation.

The door opened. With a small gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced man.

"Room 101," he said.

There was a gasp and a flurry at Winston's side. The man had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his hand clasped together.

"Comrade! Officer!" he cried. "You don't have to take me to that place! Haven't I told you everything already? What else is it you want to know? There's nothing I wouldn't confess, nothing! Just tell me what it is and I'll confess straight off. Write it down and I'll sign it—anything! Not room 101!"

"Room 101," said the officer.

The man's face, already very pale, turned a colour Winston would not have believed possible. It was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green.

"Do anything to me!" he yelled. "You've been starving me for weeks. Finish it off and let me die. Shoot me. Hang me. Sentence me to twenty-five years. Is there somebody else you want me to give away? Just say who it is and I'll tell you anything you want. I don't care who it is or what you do to them. I've got a wife and three children. The biggest of them isn't six years old. You can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes, and I'll stand by and watch it. But not Room 101!"

"Room 101," said the officer.

The man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though with some idea that he could put another victim in his own place. His eyes settled on the smashed face of the chinless man. He flung out a lean arm.

"That's the one you ought to be taking, not me!" he shouted. "You didn't hear what he was saying after they bashed his face. Give me a chance and I'll tell you every word of it. He's the one that's against the Party, not me." The guards stepped forward. The man's voice rose to a shriek. "You didn't hear him!" he repeated. "Something went wrong with the telescreen. He's the one you want. Take him, not me!"

The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless howling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on their knees, looking straight in front of them. The howling stopped; the man had no breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was a different kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.

"Room 101," said the officer.

The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him.

A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of O'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he. She might be screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: "If I could save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would." But that was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything, except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase? But that question was not answerable yet.

The boots were approaching again. The door opened. O'Brien came in.

Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen.

"They've got you too!" he cried.

"They got me a long time ago," said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful irony. He stepped aside. from behind him there emerged a broad-chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand.

"You know him, Winston," said O'Brien. "Don't deceive yourself. You did know it—you have always known it."

Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand. It might fall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow—

The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded into yellow light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain! The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The guard was laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate was answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.





Chapter Two


He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face. O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe.

Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not continuous. There had been times when consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there was no way of knowing.

With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. Later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long range of crimes—espionage, sabotage, and the like—to which everyone had to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality, though the torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness. There were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: "I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will tell them what they want." Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again. There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly, because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep.

The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted—he thought, he could not be sure—ten or twelve hours at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. In the end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Party members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as 1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known. It was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.

There were also memories of another kind. They stood out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.

He was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous. Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up.

He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched in, followed by two guards.

"Room 101," said the officer.

The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did not look at Winston either; he was looking only at the dials.

He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things he had succeeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already. With him were the guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, O'Brien, Julia, Mr. Charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with laughter. Some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened. Everything was all right, there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare, understood, forgiven.

He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had heard O'Brien's voice. All through his interrogation, although he had never seen him, he had had the feeling that O'Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once—Winston could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment of wakefulness—a voice murmured in his ear: "Don't worry, Winston; you are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you perfect." He was not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voice that had said to him, "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness," in that other dream, seven years ago.

He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually materialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move. His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head was gripped in some manner. O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round the face.

"I told you," said O'Brien, "that if we met again it would be here."

"Yes," said Winston.

Without any warning except a slight movement of O'Brien's hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. It was a frightening pain, because he could not see what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening, or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.

"You are afraid," said O'Brien, watching his face, "that in another moment something is going to break. Your especial fear is that it will be your backbone. You have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. That is what you are thinking, is it not, Winston?"

Winston did not answer. O'Brien drew back the lever on the dial. The wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come.

"That was forty," said O'Brien. "You can see that the numbers on this dial run up to a hundred. Will you please remember, throughout our conversation, that I have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree I choose? If you tell me any lies, or attempt to prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level of intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. Do you understand that?"

"Yes," said Winston.

O'Brien's manner became less severe. He resettled his spectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. When he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. He had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish.

"I am taking trouble with you, Winston," he said, "because you are worth trouble. You know perfectly well what is the matter with you. You have known it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. You are mentally deranged. You suffer from a defective memory. You are unable to remember real events and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened. Fortunately it is curable. You have never cured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. There was a small effort of the will that you were not ready to make. Even now, I am well aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue. Now we will take an example. At this moment, which power is Oceania at war with?"

"When I was arrested, Oceania was at war with Eastasia."

"With Eastasia. Good. And Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia, has it not?"

Winston drew in his breath. He opened his mouth to speak and then did not speak. He could not take his eyes away from the dial.

"The truth, please, Winston. Your truth. Tell me what you think you remember."

"I remember that until only a week before I was arrested, we were not at war with Eastasia at all. We were in alliance with them. The war was against Eurasia. That had lasted for four years. Before that—"

O'Brien stopped him with a movement of the hand.

"Another example," he said. "Some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed. You believed that three men, three onetime Party members named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford men who were executed for treachery and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession—were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with. You believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were false. There was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination. You believed that you had actually held it in your hands. It was a photograph something like this."

An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was the photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it.

"It exists!" he cried.

"No," said O'Brien.

He stepped across the room. There was a memory hole in the opposite wall. O'Brien lifted the grating. Unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame. O'Brien turned away from the wall.

"Ashes," he said. "Not even identifiable ashes. Dust. It does not exist. It never existed."

"But it did exist! It does exist! It exists in memory. I remember it. You remember it."

"I do not remember it," said O'Brien.

Winston's heart sank. That was doublethink. He had a feeling of deadly helplessness. If he could have been certain that O'Brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter. But it was perfectly possible that O'Brien had really forgotten the photograph. And if so, then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting. How could one be sure that it was simple trickery? Perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him.

O'Brien was looking down at him speculatively. More than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child.

"There is a Party slogan dealing with the control of the past," he said. "Repeat it, if you please."

"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past," repeated Winston obediently.

"Who controls the present controls the past," said O'Brien, nodding his head with slow approval. "Is it your opinion, Winston, that the past has real existence?"

Again the feeling of helplessness descended upon Winston. His eyes flitted towards the dial. He not only did not know whether "yes" or "no" was the answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true one.

O'Brien smiled faintly. "You are no metaphysician, Winston," he said. "Until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. I will put it more precisely. Does the past exist concretely, in space? Is there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still happening?"

"No."

"Then where does the past exist, if at all?"

"In records. It is written down."

"In records. And—?"

"In the mind. In human memories."

"In memory. Very well, then. We, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?"

"But how can you stop people remembering things?" cried Winston again momentarily forgetting the dial. "It is involuntary. It is outside oneself. How can you control memory? You have not controlled mine!"

O'Brien's manner grew stern again. He laid his hand on the dial.

"On the contrary," he said, "you have not controlled it. That is what has brought you here. You are here because you have failed in humility, in self-discipline. You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane."

He paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying to sink in.

"Do you remember," he went on, "writing in your diary, 'Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four'?"

"Yes," said Winston.

O'Brien held up his left hand, its back towards Winston, with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended.

"How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?"

"Four."

"And if the party says that it is not four but five—then how many?"

"Four."

The word ended in a gasp of pain. The needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five. The sweat had sprung out all over Winston's body. The air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop. O'Brien watched him, the four fingers still extended. He drew back the lever. This time the pain was only slightly eased.

"How many fingers, Winston?"

"Four."

The needle went up to sixty.

"How many fingers, Winston?"

"Four! Four! What else can I say? Four!"

The needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. The heavy, stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. The fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four.

"How many fingers, Winston?"

"Four! Stop it, stop it! How can you go on? Four! Four!"

"How many fingers, Winston?"

"Five! Five! Five!"

"No, Winston, that is no use. You are lying. You still think there are four. How many fingers, please?"

"Four! five! Four! Anything you like. Only stop it, stop the pain!"

Abruptly he was sitting up with O'Brien's arm round his shoulders. He had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. The bonds that had held his body down were loosened. He felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. For a moment he clung to O'Brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders. He had the feeling that O'Brien was his protector, that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source, and that it was O'Brien who would save him from it.

"You are a slow learner, Winston," said O'Brien gently.

"How can I help it?" he blubbered. "How can I help seeing what is in front of my eyes? Two and two are four."

"Sometimes, Winston. Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once. You must try harder. It is not easy to become sane."

He laid Winston down on the bed. The grip of his limbs tightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold. O'Brien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. The man in the white coat bent down and looked closely into Winston's eyes, felt his pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there, then he nodded to O'Brien.

"Again," said O'Brien.

The pain flowed into Winston's body. The needle must be at seventy, seventy-five. He had shut his eyes this time. He knew that the fingers were still there, and still four. All that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was over. He had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not. The pain lessened again. He opened his eyes. O'Brien had drawn back the lever.

"How many fingers, Winston?"

"Four. I suppose there are four. I would see five if I could. I am trying to see five."

"Which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or really to see them?"

"Really to see them."

"Again," said O'Brien.

Perhaps the needle was eighty—ninety. Winston could not intermittently remember why the pain was happening. Behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. He was trying to count them, he could not remember why. He knew only that it was impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four. The pain died down again. When he opened his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing. Innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past in either direction, crossing and recrossing. He shut his eyes again.

"How many fingers am I holding up, Winston?"

"I don't know. I don't know. You will kill me if you do that again. Four, five, six—in all honesty I don't know."

"Better," said O'Brien.

A needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was already half-forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien. At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on O'Brien arm. He had never loved him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The old feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back. O'Brien was a person who could be talked to. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place where they could meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind. When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.

"Do you know where you are, Winston?" he said.

"I don't know. I can guess. In the Ministry of Love."

"Do you know how long you have been here?"

"I don't know. Days, weeks, months—I think it is months."

"And why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?"

"To make them confess."

"No, that is not the reason. Try again."

"To punish them."

"No!" exclaimed O'Brien. His voice had changed extraordinarily, and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated. "No! Not merely to extract your confession, not to punish you. Shall I tell you why we have brought you here? To cure you! To make you sane! Will you understand, Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them. Do you understand what I mean by that?"

He was bending over Winston. His face looked enormous because of its nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below. Moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. Again Winston's heart shrank. If it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed. He felt certain that O'Brien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness. At this moment, however, O'Brien turned away. He took a pace or two up and down. Then he continued less vehemently:

"The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In the Middle Ages there was the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy. And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again. The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston. Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future. You will never have existed."

Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary bitterness. O'Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the thought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed.

"You are thinking," he said, "that since we intend to destroy you utterly, so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference—in that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? That is what you were thinking, was it not?"

"Yes," said Winston.

O'Brien smiled slightly. "You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him. We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it out. The command of the old despotisms was 'Thou shalt not'. The command of the totalitarians was 'Thou shalt'. Our command is 'Thou art'. No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed clean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed—Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford—in the end we broke them down. I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down, whimpering, grovelling, weeping—and in the end it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to see how they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die while their minds were still clean."

His voice had grown almost dreamy. The exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face. He is not pretending, thought Winston, he is not a hypocrite, he believes every word he says. What most oppressed him was the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. He watched the heavy yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his vision. O'Brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. There was no idea that he had ever had, or could have, that O'Brien had not long ago known, examined, and rejected. His mind contained Winston's mind. But in that case how could it be true that O'Brien was mad? It must be he, Winston, who was mad. O'Brien halted and looked down at him. His voice had grown stern again.

"Do not imagine that you will save yourself, Winston, however completely you surrender to us. No one who has once gone astray is ever spared. And even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still you would never escape from us. What happens to you here is for ever. Understand that in advance. We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back. Things will happen to you from which you could not recover, if you lived a thousand years. Never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. Everything will be dead inside you. Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. You will be hollow. We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves."

He paused and signed to the man in the white coat. Winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head. O'Brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on a level with Winston's.

"Three thousand," he said, speaking over Winston's head to the man in the white coat.

Two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against Winston's temples. He quailed. There was pain coming, a new kind of pain. O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.

"This time it will not hurt," he said. "Keep your eyes fixed on mine."

At this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an explosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. There was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light. Winston was not hurt, only prostrated. Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position. A terrific painless blow had flattened him out. Also something had happened inside his head. As his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that was gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain.

"It will not last," said O'Brien. "Look me in the eyes. What country is Oceania at war with?"

Winston thought. He knew what was meant by Oceania and that he himself was a citizen of Oceania. He also remembered Eurasia and Eastasia; but who was at war with whom he did not know. In fact he had not been aware that there was any war.

"I don't remember."

"Oceania is at war with Eastasia. Do you remember that now?"

"Yes."

"Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia. Since the beginning of your life, since the beginning of the Party, since the beginning of history, the war has continued without a break, always the same war. Do you remember that?"

"Yes."

"Eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been condemned to death for treachery. You pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent. No such piece of paper ever existed. You invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. You remember now the very moment at which you first invented it. Do you remember that?"

"Yes."

"Just now I held up the fingers of my hand to you. You saw five fingers. Do you remember that?"

"Yes."

O'Brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed.

"There are five fingers there. Do you see five fingers?"

"Yes."

And he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of his mind changed. He saw five fingers, and there was no deformity. Then everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came crowding back again. But there had been a moment—he did not know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps—of luminous certainty, when each new suggestion of O'Brien's had filled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three as easily as five, if that were what was needed. It had faded but before O'Brien had dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he could remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some period of one's life when one was in effect a different person.

"You see now," said O'Brien, "that it is at any rate possible."

"Yes," said Winston.

O'Brien stood up with a satisfied air. Over to his left Winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe. O'Brien turned to Winston with a smile. In almost the old manner he resettled his spectacles on his nose.

"Do you remember writing in your diary," he said, "that it did not matter whether I was a friend or an enemy, since I was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to? You were right. I enjoy talking to you. Your mind appeals to me. It resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane. Before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions, if you choose."

"Any question I like?"

"Anything." He saw that Winston's eyes were upon the dial. "It is switched off. What is your first question?"

"What have you done with Julia?" said Winston.

O'Brien smiled again. "She betrayed you, Winston. Immediately-unreservedly. I have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. You would hardly recognize her if you saw her. All her rebelliousness, her deceit, her folly, her dirty-mindedness—everything has been burned out of her. It was a perfect conversion, a textbook case."

"You tortured her?"

O'Brien left this unanswered. "Next question," he said.

"Does Big Brother exist?"

"Of course he exists. The Party exists. Big Brother is the embodiment of the Party."

"Does he exist in the same way as I exist?"

"You do not exist," said O'Brien.

Once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. He knew, or he could imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were nonsense, they were only a play on words. Did not the statement, "You do not exist", contain a logical absurdity? But what use was it to say so? His mind shrivelled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with which O'Brien would demolish him.

"I think I exist," he said wearily. "I am conscious of my own identity. I was born and I shall die. I have arms and legs. I occupy a particular point in space. No other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously. In that sense, does Big Brother exist?"

"It is of no importance. He exists."

"Will Big Brother ever die?"

"Of course not. How could he die? Next question."

"Does the Brotherhood exist?"

"That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set you free when we have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No. As long as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind."

Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still had not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. He had got to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. There was a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam. He knows, thought Winston suddenly, he knows what I am going to ask! At the thought the words burst out of him:

"What is in Room 101?"

The expression on O'Brien's face did not change. He answered drily:

"You know what is in Room 101, Winston. Everyone knows what is in Room 101."

He raised a finger to the man in the white coat. Evidently the session was at an end. A needle jerked into Winston's arm. He sank almost instantly into deep sleep.





Chapter Three


"There are three stages in your reintegration," said O'Brien. "There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It is time for you to enter upon the second stage."

As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds were looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could evade its pangs if he was quickwitted enough: it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many sessions there had been. The whole process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite time—weeks, possibly—and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.

"As you lie there," said O'Brien, "you have often wondered you have even asked me—why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble on you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived in, but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary, 'I understand how: I do not understand why'? It was when you thought about 'why' that you doubted your own sanity. You have read the book, Goldstein's book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tell you anything that you did not know already?"

"You have read it?" said Winston.

"I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. No book is produced individually, as you know."

"Is it true, what it says?"

"A description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secret accumulation of knowledge—a gradual spread of enlightenment—ultimately a proletarian rebellion—the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself that that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts."

He came closer to the bed. "For ever!" he repeated. "And now let us get back to the question of 'how' and 'why'. You understand well enough how the Party maintains itself in power. Now tell me why we cling to power. What is our motive? Why should we want power? Go on, speak," he added as Winston remained silent.

Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. That the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better. That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that when O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face. O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?

"You are ruling over us for our own good," he said feebly.

"You believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore—"

He started and almost cried out. A pang of pain had shot through his body. O'Brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five.

"That was stupid, Winston, stupid!" he said. "You should know better than to say a thing like that."

He pulled the lever back and continued:

"Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?"

Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of O'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheekbones. O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer.

"You are thinking," he said, "that my face is old and tired. You are thinking that I talk of power, and yet I am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body. Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell? The weariness of the cell is the vigour of the organism. Do you die when you cut your fingernails?"

He turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one hand in his pocket.

"We are the priests of power," he said. "God is power. But at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realize is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: 'Freedom is Slavery'. Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is freedom. Alone—free—the human being is always defeated. It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he is the Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body but, above all, over the mind. Power over matter—external reality, as you would call it—is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute."

For a moment Winston ignored the dial. He made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully.

"But how can you control matter?" he burst out. "You don't even control the climate or the law of gravity. And there are disease, pain, death—"

O'Brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. "We control matter because we control the mind. Reality is inside the skull. You will learn by degrees, Winston. There is nothing that we could not do. Invisibility, levitation—anything. I could float off this floor like a soap bubble if I wish to. I do not wish to, because the Party does not wish it. You must get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of Nature. We make the laws of Nature."

"But you do not! You are not even masters of this planet. What about Eurasia and Eastasia? You have not conquered them yet."

"Unimportant. We shall conquer them when it suits us. And if we did not, what difference would it make? We can shut them out of existence. Oceania is the world."

"But the world itself is only a speck of dust. And man is tiny, helpless! How long has he been in existence? For millions of years the earth was uninhabited."

"Nonsense. The earth is as old as we are, no older. How could it be older? Nothing exists except through human consciousness."

"But the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals—mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of."

"Have you ever seen those bones, Winston? Of course not. Nineteenth-century biologists invented them. Before man there was nothing. After man, if he could come to an end, there would be nothing. Outside man there is nothing."

"But the whole universe is outside us. Look at the stars! Some of them are a million light-years away. They are out of our reach for ever."

"What are the stars?" said O'Brien indifferently. "They are bits of fire a few kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could blot them out. The earth is the centre of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it."

Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say anything. O'Brien continued as though answering a spoken objection:

"For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it? Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?"

Winston shrank back upon the bed. Whatever he said, the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon. And yet he knew, he knew, that he was in the right. The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind— surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? Had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy? There was even a name for it, which he had forgotten. A faint smile twitched the corners of O'Brien's mouth as he looked down at him.

"I told you, Winston," he said, "that metaphysics is not your strong point. The word you are trying to think of is solipsism. But you are mistaken. This is not solipsism. Collective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression," he added in a different tone. "The real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men." He paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: "How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?"

Winston thought. "By making him suffer," he said.

"Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always—do not forget this, Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever."

He paused as though he expected Winston to speak. Winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again. He could not say anything. His heart seemed to be frozen. O'Brien went on:

"And remember that it is for ever. The face will always be there to be stamped upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you have undergone since you have been in our hands—all that will continue, and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible—and in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you will do more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, become part of it."

Winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak. "You can't!" he said weakly.

"What do you mean by that remark, Winston?"

"You could not create such a world as you have just described. It is a dream. It is impossible."

"Why?"

"It is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty. It would never endure."

"Why not?"

"It would have no vitality. It would disintegrate. It would commit suicide."

"Nonsense. You are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love. Why should it be? And if it were, what difference would that make? Suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. Suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. Still what difference would it make? Can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death? The party is immortal."

As usual, the voice had battered Winston into helplessness. Moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement O'Brien would twist the dial again. And yet he could not keep silent. Feebly, without arguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what O'Brien had said, he returned to the attack.

"I don't know—I don't care. Somehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you."

"We control life, Winston, at all its levels. You are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. But we create human nature. Men are infinitely malleable. Or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. Put it out of your mind. They are helpless, like the animals. Humanity is the Party. The others are outside—irrelevant."

"I don't care. In the end they will beat you. Sooner or later they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces."

"Do you see any evidence that that is happening? Or any reason why it should?"

"No. I believe it. I know that you will fail. There is something in the universe—I don't know, some spirit, some principle—that you will never overcome."

"Do you believe in God, Winston?"

"No."

"Then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?"

"I don't know. The spirit of Man."

"And do you consider yourself a man?"

"Yes."

"If you are a man, Winston, you are the last man. Your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. Do you understand that you are alone? You are outside history, you are non-existent." His manner changed and he said more harshly: "And you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our lies and our cruelty?"

"Yes, I consider myself superior."

O'Brien did not speak. Two other voices were speaking. After a moment Winston recognized one of them as his own. It was a sound-track of the conversation he had had with O'Brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself in the Brotherhood. He heard himself promising to lie, to steal, to forge, to murder, to encourage drug-taking and prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child's face. O'Brien made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making. Then he turned a switch and the voices stopped.

"Get up from that bed," he said.

The bonds had loosened themselves. Winston lowered himself to the floor and stood up unsteadily.

"You are the last man," said O'Brien. "You are the guardian of the human spirit. You shall see yourself as you are. Take off your clothes."

Winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. The zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of them. He could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time. Beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. As he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room. He approached it, then stopped short. An involuntary cry had broken out of him.

"Go on," said O'Brien. "Stand between the wings of the mirror. You shall see the side view as well."

He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed, greycoloured, skeleton-like thing was coming towards him. Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and batteredlooking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful. The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant about seeing the side view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from some malignant disease.

"You have thought sometimes," said O'Brien, "that my face—the face of a member of the Inner Party—looks old and worn. What do you think of your own face?"

He seized Winston's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him.

"Look at the condition you are in!" he said. "Look at this filthy grime all over your body. Look at the dirt between your toes. Look at that disgusting running sore on your leg. Do you know that you stink like a goat? Probably you have ceased to notice it. Look at your emaciation. Do you see? I can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. I could snap your neck like a carrot. Do you know that you have lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our hands? Even your hair is coming out in handfuls. Look!" He plucked at Winston's head and brought away a tuft of hair. "Open your mouth. Nine, ten, eleven teeth left. How many had you when you came to us? And the few you have left are dropping out of your head. Look here!"

He seized one of Winston's remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb and forefinger. A twinge of pain shot through Winston's jaw. O'Brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. He tossed it across the cell.

"You are rotting away," he said; "you are falling to pieces. What are you? A bag of filth. Now turn around and look into that mirror again. Do you see that thing facing you? That is the last man. If you are human, that is humanity. Now put your clothes on again."

Winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. Until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. Only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined. Then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him. Before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed on to a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. He was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light: but he could not stop himself. O'Brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almost kindly.

"It will not last for ever," he said. "You can escape from it whenever you choose. Everything depends on yourself."

"You did it!" sobbed Winston. "You reduced me to this state."

"No, Winston, you reduced yourself to it. This is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the Party. It was all contained in that first act. Nothing has happened that you did not foresee."

He paused, and then went on:

"We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen what your body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you?"

Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O'Brien.

"I have not betrayed Julia," he said.

O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. "No," he said; "no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia."

The peculiar reverence for O'Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded Winston's heart again. How intelligent, he thought, how intelligent! Never did O'Brien fail to understand what was said to him. Anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed Julia. For what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture? He had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said to her and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, their vague plottings against the Party—everything. And yet, in the sense in which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. He had not stopped loving her; his feelings towards her had remained the same. O'Brien had seen what he meant without the need for explanation.

"Tell me," he said, "how soon will they shoot me?"

"It might be a long time," said O'Brien. "You are a difficult case. But don't give up hope. Everyone is cured sooner or later. In the end we shall shoot you."





Chapter Four


He was much better. He was growing fatter and stronger every day, if it was proper to speak of days.

The white light and the humming sound were the same as ever, but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. There was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. They had given him a bath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin. They even gave him warm water to wash with. They had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls. They had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment. They had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures.

Weeks or months must have passed. It would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he had felt any interest in doing so, since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. He was getting, he judged, three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. The food was surprisingly good, with meat at every third meal. Once there was even a packet of cigarettes. He had no matches, but the never-speaking guard who brought his food would give him a light. The first time he tried to smoke it made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out for a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal.

They had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner. At first he made no use of it. Even when he was awake he was completely torpid. Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed to make no difference, except that one's dreams were more coherent. He dreamed a great deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. He was in the Golden Country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious, sunlit ruins, with his mother, with Julia, with O'Brien—not doing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. Such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. He seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the stimulus of pain had been removed. He was not bored, he had no desire for conversation or distraction. Merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was completely satisfying.

By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there, trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees. After that, reluctantly at first, he began exercising himself regularly. In a little while he could walk three kilometres, measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on his heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre. But after a few more days—a few more mealtimes—even that feat was accomplished. A time came when he could do it six times running. He began to grow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal. Only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror.

His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank bed, his back against the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educating himself.

He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as he saw now, he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. From the moment when he was inside the Ministry of Love—and yes, even during those minutes when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to do—he had grasped the frivolity, the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the Party. He knew now that for seven years the Thought Police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying glass. There was no physical act, no word spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they had not been able to infer. Even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced. They had played sound-tracks to him, shown him photographs. Some of them were photographs of Julia and himself. Yes, even… He could not fight against the Party any longer. Besides, the Party was in the right. It must be so; how could the immortal, collective brain be mistaken? By what external standard could you check its judgements? Sanity was statistical. It was merely a question of learning to think as they thought. Only!

The pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He began to write down the thoughts that came into his head. He wrote first in large clumsy capitals:



FREEDOM IS SLAVERY



Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:



TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE



But then there came a sort of check. His mind, as though shying away from something, seemed unable to concentrate. He knew that he knew what came next, but for the moment he could not recall it. When he did recall it, it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not come of its own accord. He wrote:



GOD IS POWER



He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were charged with. He had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt. It had never existed, he had invented it. He remembered remembering contrary things, but those were false memories, products of self-deception. How easy it all was! Only surrender, and everything else followed. It was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except your own attitude: the predestined thing happened in any case. He hardly knew why he had ever rebelled. Everything was easy, except!

Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. "If I wished," O'Brien had said, "I could float off this floor like a soap bubble." Winston worked it out. "If he thinks he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously think I see him do it, then the thing happens." Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: "It doesn't really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination." He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a "real" world where "real" things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.

He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no danger of succumbing to it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought never to have occurred to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive. Crimestop, they called it in Newspeak.

He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He presented himself with propositions—"the Party says the earth is flat", "the party says that ice is heavier than water"—and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as "two and two make five" were beyond his intellectual grasp. It needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.

All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would shoot him. "Everything depends on yourself," O'Brien had said; but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. It might be ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him for years in solitary confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they might release him for a while, as they sometimes did. It was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again. The one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment. The tradition—the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though you never heard it said—was that they shot you from behind; always in the back of the head, without warning, as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell.

One day—but "one day" was not the right expression; just as probably it was in the middle of the night: once—he fell into a strange, blissful reverie. He was walking down the corridor, waiting for the bullet. He knew that it was coming in another moment. Everything was settled, smoothed out, reconciled. There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no more pain, no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily, with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longer in the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, he was in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometre wide, down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. He was in the Golden Country, following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture. He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly stirring, and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows.

Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The sweat broke out on his backbone. He had heard himself cry aloud:

"Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!"

For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence. She had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. It was as though she had got into the texture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free. Also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.

He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. What had he done? How many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness?

In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. They could not let such an outburst go unpunished. They would know now, if they had not known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them. He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had retreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped to keep the inner heart inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but he preferred to be in the wrong. They would understand that— O'Brien would understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.

He would have to start all over again. It might take years. He ran a hand over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. There were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose flattened. Besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. In any case, mere control of the features was not enough. For the first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right; he must feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst.

One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not tell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. It was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then suddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the changing of a line in his face—suddenly the camouflage would be down and bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame. And almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early. They would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would be unpunished, unrepented, out of their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole in their own perfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.

He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than accepting an intellectual discipline. It was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. He had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. What was the most horrible, sickening thing of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face (because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord. What were his true feelings towards Big Brother?

There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The steel door swung open with a clang. O'Brien walked into the cell. Behind him were the waxen-faced officer and the black-uniformed guards.

"Get up," said O'Brien. "Come here."

Winston stood opposite him. O'Brien took Winston's shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him closely.

"You have had thoughts of deceiving me," he said. "That was stupid. Stand up straighter. Look me in the face."

He paused, and went on in a gentler tone:

"You are improving. Intellectually there is very little wrong with you. It is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress. Tell me, Winston—and remember, no lies: you know that I am always able to detect a lie—tell me, what are your true feelings towards Big Brother?"

"I hate him."

"You hate him. Good. Then the time has come for you to take the last step. You must love Big Brother. It is not enough to obey him: you must love him."

He released Winston with a little push towards the guards.

"Room 101," he said.





Chapter Five


At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know, whereabouts he was in the windowless building. Possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level. The room where he had been interrogated by O'Brien was high up near the roof. This place was many metres underground, as deep down as it was possible to go.

It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed his surroundings. All he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him to look straight in front of him.

For a moment he was alone, then the door opened and O'Brien came in.

"You asked me once," said O'Brien, "what was in Room 101. I told you that you knew the answer already. Everyone knows it. The thing that is in Room 101 is the worst thing in the world."

The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire, a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table. Because of the position in which O'Brien was standing, Winston could not see what the thing was.

"The worst thing in the world," said O'Brien, "varies from individual to individual. It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is some quite trivial thing, not even fatal."

He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature in each. They were rats.

"In your case, "said O'Brien, "the worst thing in the world happens to be rats."

A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had passed through Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage. But at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water.

"You can't do that!" he cried out in a high cracked voice. "You couldn't, you couldn't! It's impossible."

"Do you remember," said O'Brien, "the moment of panic that used to occur in your dreams? There was a wall of blackness in front of you, and a roaring sound in your ears. There was something terrible on the other side of the wall. You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it into the open. It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall."

"O'Brien!" said Winston, making an effort to control his voice. "You know this is not necessary. What is it that you want me to do?"

O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected. He looked thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind Winston's back.

"By itself," he said, "pain is not always enough. There are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death. But for everyone there is something unendurable—something that cannot be contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same with the rats. For you, they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand even if you wished to. You will do what is required of you."

"But what is it, what is it? How can I do it if I don't know what it is?"

O'Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table. He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston could hear the blood singing in his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness. He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances. Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They were enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey.

"The rat," said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible audience, "although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes. The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying people. They show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless."

There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winston from far away. The rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each other through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of despair. That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.

O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it. There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held immovably. O'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a metre from Winston's face.

"I have pressed the first lever," said O'Brien. "You understand the construction of this cage. The mask will fit over your head, leaving no exit. When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up. These starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever seen a rat leap through the air? They will leap on to your face and bore straight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue."

The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. But he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a split second left—to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had gone black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one way to save himself. He must interpose another human being, the body of another human being, between himself and the rats.

The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. The rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, the other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless.

"It was a common punishment in Imperial China," said O'Brien as didactically as ever.

The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then—no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment—one body that he could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically, over and over.

"Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do to her. Tear her face off, strip her to the bones. Not me! Julia! Not me!"

He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He was still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars—always away, away, away from the rats. He was light years distant, but O'Brien was still standing at his side. There was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek. But through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open.





Chapter Six


The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight slanting through a window fell on dusty table-tops. It was the lonely hour of fifteen. A tinny music trickled from the telescreens.

Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and filled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork. It was saccharine flavoured with cloves, the speciality of the cafe.

Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present only music was coming out of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace. The news from the African front was disquieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worrying about it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) was moving southward at terrifying speed. The mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite area, but it was probable that already the mouth of the Congo was a battlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in danger. One did not have to look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely a question of losing Central Africa: for the first time in the whole war, the territory of Oceania itself was menaced.

A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement, flared up in him, then faded again. He stopped thinking about the war. In these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp. As always, the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly. The stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those—

He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible he never visualized them. They were something that he was half-aware of, hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they released him, and had regained his old colour—indeed, more than regained it. His features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again unbidden, brought the chessboard and the current issue of The Times, with the page turned down at the chess problem. Then, seeing that Winston's glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was no need to give orders. They knew his habits. The chessboard was always waiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when the place was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him. He never even bothered to count his drinks. At irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him. It would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. He had always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, more highly-paid than his old job had been.

The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletins from the front, however. It was merely a brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter, it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan's quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by 98 per cent.

He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. "White to play and mate in two moves." Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. White always mates.

The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone: "You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty. Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest importance. Take care not to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!" The tinking music struck up again.

Winston's heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming. All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in his mind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. There was the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear, cutting their comunications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence. But it was necessary to act quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they had airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medley of feeling—but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was undermost struggled inside him.

The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its place, but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem. His thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table:



2+2=5



"They can't get inside you," she had said. But they could get inside you. "What happens to you here is for ever," O'Brien had said. That was a true word. There were things, your own acts, from which you could never recover. Something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out.

He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was no danger in it. He knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him. It struck him at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way. They almost passed one another without a sign, then he turned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was no danger, nobody would take any interest in him. She did not speak. She walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was vilely cold. The wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional, dirty-looking crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.

There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones: besides, they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered. They could have lain down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to. His flesh froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been.

He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked back across the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time. It was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by side but not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak. She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig. Her feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.

"I betrayed you," she said baldly.

"I betrayed you," he said.

She gave him another quick look of dislike.

"Sometimes," she said, "they threaten you with something, something you can't stand up to, can't even think about. And then you say, 'Don't do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to So-and-so.' And perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn't really mean it. But that isn't true. At the time when it happens you do mean it. You think there's no other way of saving yourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way. You want it to happen to the other person. You don't give a damn what they suffer. All you care about is yourself."

"All you care about is yourself," he echoed.

"And after that, you don't feel the same towards the other person any longer."

"No," he said, "you don't feel the same."

There did not seem to be anything more to say. The wind plastered their thin overalls against their bodies. Almost at once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence: besides, it was too cold to keep still. She said something about catching her Tube and stood up to go.

"We must meet again," he said.

"Yes," she said, "we must meet again."

He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her. They did not speak again. She did not actually try to shake him off, but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her. He had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube station, but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from Julia as to get back to the Chestnut Tree Cafe, which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment. He had a nostalgic vision of his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the everflowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The next moment, not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people. He made a halfhearted attempt to catch up, then slowed down, turned, and made off in the opposite direction. When he had gone fifty metres he looked back. The street was not crowded, but already he could not distinguish her. Any one of a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers. Perhaps her thickened, stiffened body was no longer recognizable from behind.

"At the time when it happens," she had said, "you do mean it." He had meant it. He had not merely said it, he had wished it. He had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to the—

Something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen. A cracked and jeering note, a yellow note, came into it. And then—perhaps it was not happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound—a voice was singing:



Under the spreading chestnut tree

I sold you and you sold me



The tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle. He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank. But it had become the element he swam in. It was his life, his death, and his resurrection. It was gin that sank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning. When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight. Through the midday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, listening to the telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the Chestnut Tree. No one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, no telescreen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went to a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth and did a little work, or what was called work. He had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They were engaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out. It was something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed inside brackets, or outside. There were four others on the committee, all of them persons similar to himself. There were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again, frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done. But there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never finished—when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions, enormous digressions, quarrels threats, even, to appeal to higher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow.

The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merely changing the music. He had the map of Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: a black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontally eastward, across the tail of the first. As though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist?

His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful of gin, picked up the white knight and made a tentative move. Check. But it was evidently not the right move, because—

Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a candle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed, and himself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor, shaking a dice-box, and laughing excitedly. His mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing.

It must have been about a month before she disappeared. It was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. He remembered the day well, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the window-pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the two children in the dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable. Winston whined and grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently. In the end his mother said, "Now be good, and I'll buy you a toy. A lovely toy—you'll love it"; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby, and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and Ladders. He could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest. But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play. Soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting-point. They played eight games, winning four each. His tiny sister, too young to understand what the game was about, had sat propped up against a bolster, laughing because the others were laughing. For a whole afternoon they had all been happy together, as in his earlier childhood.

He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a false memory. He was troubled by false memories occasionally. They did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were. Some things had happened, others had not happened. He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again. Almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter. He had started as though a pin had run into him.

A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the bulletin! Victory! It always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news. A sort of electric drill ran through the cafe. Even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears.

The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise. Already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. The news had run round the streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as he had foreseen; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy's rear, the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black. Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: "Vast strategic manoeuvre—perfect coordination—utter rout—half a million prisoners—complete demoralization—control of the whole of Africa—bring the war within measurable distance of its end victory—greatest victory in human history—victory, victory, victory!"

Under the table Winston's feet made convulsive movements. He had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at the portrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world! The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! He thought how ten minutes ago—yes, only ten minutes—there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army that had perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry of Love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened, until this moment.

The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little. The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached with the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer. He was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow. He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating everybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The longhoped-for bullet was entering his brain.

He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.





APPENDIX


The Principles of Newspeak


Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of communication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in The Times were written in it, but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would have finally superseded Oldspeak (or Standard English, as we should call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all Party members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984, and embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final, perfected version, as embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, that we are concerned here.

The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought—that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc—should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single example: The word free still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as "This dog is free from lice" or "This field is free from weeds". It could not be used in its old sense of "politically free" or "intellectually free" since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless. Quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum.

Newspeak was founded on the English language as we now know it, though many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words, would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary, the B vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary. It will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the A vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories.



The A vocabulary.

The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday life—for such things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like. It was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess; words like hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, field—but in comparison with the present-day English vocabulary their number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of them. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept. It would have been quite impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosophical discussion. It was intended only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions.

The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as if or when) could be used either as verb, noun, adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms. The word thought, for example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its place was taken by think, which did duty for both noun and verb. No etymological principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently suppressed. There was, for example, no such word as cut, its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb knife. Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix -ful to the noun—verb, and adverbs by adding -wise. Thus for example, speedful meant "rapid" and speedwise meant "quickly". Certain of our present-day adjectives, such as good, strong, big, black, soft, were retained, but their total number was very small. There was little need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding -ful to a noun-verb. None of the nowexisting adverbs was retained, except for a very few already ending in -wise: the -wise termination was invariable. The word well, for example, was replaced by goodwise.

In addition, any word—this again applied in principle to every word in the language—could be negatived by adding the affix un- or could be strengthened by the affix plus-, or, for still greater emphasis, doubleplus-. Thus, for example, uncold meant "warm", while pluscold and doublepluscold meant, respectively, "very cold" and "superlatively cold". It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ante-, post-, up-, down-, etc. By such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary. Given, for instance, the word good, there was no need for such a word as bad, since the required meaning was equally well—indeed, better—expressed by ungood. All that was necessary, in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide which of them to suppress. Dark, for example, could be replaced by unlight, or light by undark, according to preference.

The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in -ed. The preterite of steal was stealed, the preterite of think was thinked, and so on throughout the language, all such forms as swam, gave, brought, spoke, taken, etc., being abolished. All plurals were made by adding -s or -es as the case might be. The plurals of man, ox, life, were mans, oxes, lifes. Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding -er, -est (good, gooder, goodest), irregular forms and the more, most formation being suppressed.

The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that whom had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the shall, should tenses had been dropped, all their uses being covered by will and would. There were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word: occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt chiefly in connection with the B vocabulary. Why so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.



The B vocabulary.

The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without a full understanding of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly. In some cases they could be translated into Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language.

The B words were in all cases compound words.

They consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single example: the word goodthink, meaning, very roughly, "orthodoxy", or, if one chose to regard it as a verb, "to think in an orthodox manner". This inflected as follows: noun-verb, good-think; past tense and past participle, good-thinked; present participle, goodthinking; adjective, goodthinkful; adverb, goodthinkwise; verbal noun, goodthinker.

The B words were not constructed on any etymological plan. The words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation. In the word crimethink (thoughtcrime), for instance, the think came second, whereas in thinkpol (Thought Police) it came first, and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable. Because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the B vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example, the adjective forms of Minitrue, Minipax, and Miniluv were, respectively, Minitruthful, Minipeaceful, and Minilovely, simply because -trueful, -paxful, and -loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce. In principle, however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way.

Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. Consider, for example, such a typical sentence from a Times leading article as Oldthinkers unbellyfeel Ingsoc. The shortest rendering that one could make of this in Oldspeak would be: "Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of English Socialism." But this is not an adequate translation. To begin with, in order to compound, words such as speakwrite, were of course to be found in the A vocabulary, but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.

To grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by Ingsoc. And in addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word bellyfeel, which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word oldthink, which was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the special function of certain Newspeak words, of which oldthink was one, was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. These words, necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped and forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak Dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words they cancelled by their existence.

As we have already seen in the case of the word free, words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them. Countless other words such as honour, justice, morality, internationalism, democracy, science, and religion had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. All words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single word crimethink, while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink. Greater precision would have been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other than his own worshipped "false gods". He did not need to know that these gods were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah and the commandments of Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. In somewhat the same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by the two Newspeak words sexcrime (sexual immorality) and goodsex (chastity). Sexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practised for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death. In the C vocabulary, which consisted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them. He knew what was meant by goodsex—that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was sexcrime. In Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it was heretical: beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent.

No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically neutral. A great many were euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as joycamp (forced-labour camp) or Minipax Ministry of Peace, (i.e. Ministry of War) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic society. An example was prolefeed, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the Party handed out to the masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation "good" when applied to the Party and "bad" when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning, but from their structure.

So far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary. The name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. In the Ministry of Truth, for example, the Records Department, in which Winston Smith worked, was called Recdep, the Fiction Department was called Ficdep, the Teleprogrammes Department was called Teledep, and so on. This was not done solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such words as Nazi, Gestapo, Comintern, Inprecorr, Agitprop. In the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. It was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it. The words Communist International, for instance, call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris Commune. The word Comintern, on the other hand, suggests merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine. It refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table. Comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas Communist International is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. In the same way, the associations called up by a word like Minitrue are fewer and more controllable than those called up by Ministry of Truth. This accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable.

In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker's mind. The words of the B vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost invariably these words—goodthink, Minipax, prolefeed, sexcrime, joycamp, Ingsoc, bellyfeel, thinkpol, and countless others—were words of two or three syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last. The use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous. And this was exactly what was aimed at. The intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. His training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.

So did the fact of having very few words to choose from. Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year. Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all. This aim was frankly admitted in the Newspeak word duckspeak, meaning "to quack like a duck". Like various other words in the B vocabulary, duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning. Provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but praise, and when The Times referred to one of the orators of the Party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and valued compliment.



The C vocabulary.

The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings. They followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies. Very few of the C words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular branches. There was, indeed, no word for "Science", any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word Ingsoc.

From the foregoing account it will be seen that in Newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible. It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say Big Brother is ungood. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. Ideas inimical to Ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so. One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For example, All mans are equal was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which All men are redhaired is a possible Oldspeak sentence. It did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpable untruth—i.e. that all men are of equal size, weight, or strength. The concept of political equality no longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word equal. In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication, the danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might remember their original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanished. A person growing up with Newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of "politically equal", or that free had once meant "intellectually free", than for instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook. There would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of Newspeak would become more and more pronounced—its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing.

When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with the past would have been severed. History had already been rewritten, but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there, imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one's knowledge of Oldspeak it was possible to read them. In the future such fragments, even if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable. It was impossible to translate any passage of Oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action, or was already orthodox (goodthinkful would be the Newspeak expression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written before approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translation—that is, alteration in sense as well as language. Take for example the well-known passage from the Declaration of Independence:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men, deriving their powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of those ends, it is the right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government…

It would have been quite impossible to render this into Newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original. The nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink. A full translation could only be an ideological translation, whereby Jefferson's words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.

A good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being transformed in this way. Considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figures, while at the same time bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc. Various writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had been completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of the literature of the past, would be destroyed. These translations were a slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they would be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first century. There were also large quantities of merely utilitarian literature—indispensable technical manuals, and the like—that had to be treated in the same way. It was chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of Newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.





Why I Write


George Orwell



From a very early age, perhaps the age of five or six, I knew that when I grew up I should be a writer. Between the ages of about seventeen and twenty-four I tried to abandon this idea, but I did so with the consciousness that I was outraging my true nature and that sooner or later I should have to settle down and write books.

I was the middle child of three, but there was a gap of five years on either side, and I barely saw my father before I was eight. For this and other reasons I was somewhat lonely, and I soon developed disagreeable mannerisms which made me unpopular throughout my schooldays. I had the lonely child's habit of making up stories and holding conversations with imaginary persons, and I think from the very start my literary ambitions were mixed up with the feeling of being isolated and undervalued. I knew that I had a facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts, and I felt that this created a sort of private world in which I could get my own back for my failure in everyday life. Nevertheless the volume of serious—i.e. seriously intended—writing which I produced all through my childhood and boyhood would not amount to half a dozen pages. I wrote my first poem at the age of four or five, my mother taking it down to dictation. I cannot remember anything about it except that it was about a tiger and the tiger had "chair-like teeth"—a good enough phrase, but I fancy the poem was a plagiarism of Blake's "Tiger, Tiger". At eleven, when the war or 1914—18 broke out, I wrote a patriotic poem which was printed in the local newspaper, as was another, two years later, on the death of Kitchener. From time to time, when I was a bit older, I wrote bad and usually unfinished "nature poems" in the Georgian style. I also attempted a short story which was a ghastly failure. That was the total of the would-be serious work that I actually set down on paper during all those years.

However, throughout this time I did in a sense engage in literary activities. To begin with there was the made-to-order stuff which I produced quickly, easily and without much pleasure to myself. Apart from school work, I wrote vers d'occasion, semi-comic poems which I could turn out at what now seems to me astonishing speed—at fourteen I wrote a whole rhyming play, in imitation of Aristophanes, in about a week—and helped to edit school magazines, both printed and in manuscript. These magazines were the most pitiful burlesque stuff that you could imagine, and I took far less trouble with them than I now would with the cheapest journalism. But side by side with all this, for fifteen years or more, I was carrying out a literary exercise of a quite different kind: this was the making up of a continuous "story" about myself, a sort of diary existing only in the mind. I believe this is a common habit of children and adolescents. As a very small child I used to imagine that I was, say, Robin Hood, and picture myself as the hero of thrilling adventures, but quite soon my "story" ceased to be narcissistic in a crude way and became more and more a mere description of what I was doing and the things I saw. For minutes at a time this kind of thing would be running through my head: "He pushed the door open and entered the room. A yellow beam of sunlight, filtering through the muslin curtains, slanted on to the table, where a match-box, half-open, lay beside the inkpot. With his right hand in his pocket he moved across to the window. Down in the street a tortoiseshell cat was chasing a dead leaf ", etc., etc. This habit continued until I was about twenty-five, right through my non-literary years. Although I had to search, and did search, for the right words, I seemed to be making this descriptive effort almost against my will, under a kind of compulsion from outside. The "story" must, I suppose, have reflected the styles of the various writers I admired at different ages, but so far as I remember it always had the same meticulous descriptive quality.

When I was about sixteen I suddenly discovered the joy of mere words, i.e. the sounds and associations of words. The lines from Paradise Lost —



So hee with difficulty and labour hard

Moved on: with difficulty and labour hee.



which do not now seem to me so very wonderful, sent shivers down my backbone; and the spelling "hee" for "he" was an added pleasure. As for the need to describe things, I knew all about it already. So it is clear what kind of books I wanted to write, in so far as I could be said to want to write books at that time. I wanted to write enormous naturalistic novels with unhappy endings, full of detailed descriptions and arresting similes, and also full of purple passages in which words were used partly for the sake of their own sound. And in fact my first completed novel, Burmese Days, which I wrote when I was thirty but projected much earlier, is rather that kind of book.

I give all this background information because I do not think one can assess a writer's motives without knowing something of his early development. His subject matter will be determined by the age he livesin—at least this is true in tumultuous, revolutionary ages like our own—but before he ever begins to write he will have acquired an emotional attitude from which he will never completely escape. It is his job, no doubt, to discipline his temperament and avoid getting stuck at some immature stage, in some perverse mood; but if he escapes from his early influences altogether, he will have killed his impulse to write. Putting aside the need to earn a living, I think there are four great motives for writing, at any rate for writing prose. They exist in different degrees in every writer, and in any one writer the proportions will vary from time to time, according to the atmosphere in which he is living. They are:

(i) Sheer egoism. Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on the grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc., etc. It is humbug to pretend this is not a motive, and a strong one. Writers share this characteristic with scientists, artists, politicians, lawyers, soldiers, successful businessmen—in short, with the whole top crust of humanity. The great mass of human beings are not acutely selfish. After the age of about thirty, they almost abandon the sense of being individuals at all—and live chiefly for others, or are simply smothered under drudgery. But there is also the minority of gifted, willful people who are determined to live their own lives to the end, and writers belong in this class. Serious writers, I should say, are on the whole more vain and self-centered than journalists, though less interested in money.

(ii) Aesthetic enthusiasm. Perception of beauty in the external world, or, on the other hand, in words and their right arrangement. Pleasure in the impact of one sound on another, in the firmness of good prose or the rhythm of a good story. Desire to share an experience which one feels is valuable and ought not to be missed. The aesthetic motive is very feeble in a lot of writers, but even a pamphleteer or writer of textbooks will have pet words and phrases which appeal to him for non-utilitarian reasons; or he may feel strongly about typography, width of margins, etc. Above the level of a railway guide, no book is quite free from aesthetic considerations.

(iii) Historical impulse. Desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.

(iv) Political purpose. — Using the word "political" in the widest possible sense. Desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other peoples' idea of the kind of society that they should strive after. Once again, no book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude.

It can be seen how these various impulses must war against one another, and how they must fluctuate from person to person and from time to time. By nature—taking your "nature" to be the state you have attained when you are first adult—I am a person in whom the first three motives would outweigh the fourth. In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive books, and might have remained almost unaware of my political loyalties. As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of pamphleteer. First I spent five years in an unsuitable profession (the Indian Imperial Police, in Burma), and then I underwent poverty and the sense of failure. This increased my natural hatred of authority and made me for the first time fully aware of the existence of the working classes, and the job in Burma had given me some understanding of the nature of imperialism: but these experiences were not enough to give me an accurate political orientation. Then came Hitler, the Spanish Civil War, etc. By the end of 1935 I had still failed to reach a firm decision. I remember a little poem that I wrote at that date, expressing my dilemma:



A happy vicar I might have been

Two hundred years ago

To preach upon eternal doom

And watch my walnuts grow;



But born, alas, in an evil time,

I missed that pleasant haven,

For the hair has grown on my upper lip

And the clergy are all clean-shaven.



And later still the times were good,

We were so easy to please,

We rocked our troubled thoughts to sleep

On the bosoms of the trees.



All ignorant we dared to own

The joys we now dissemble;

The greenfinch on the apple bough

Could make my enemies tremble.



But girl's bellies and apricots,

Roach in a shaded stream,

Horses, ducks in flight at dawn,

All these are a dream.



It is forbidden to dream again;

We maim our joys or hide them:

Horses are made of chromium steel

And little fat men shall ride them.



I am the worm who never turned,

The eunuch without a harem;

Between the priest and the commissar

I walk like Eugene Aram;



And the commissar is telling my fortune

While the radio plays,

But the priest has promised an Austin Seven,

For Duggie always pays.



I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls,

And woke to find it true;

I wasn't born for an age like this;

Was Smith? Was Jones? Were you?



The Spanish war and other events in 1936—37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it. It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone writes of them in one guise or another. It is simply a question of which side one takes and what approach one follows. And the more one is conscious of one's political bias, the more chance one has of acting politically without sacrificing one's aesthetic and intellectual integrity.

What I have most wanted to do throughout the past ten years is to make political writing into an art. My starting point is always a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice. When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, "I am going to produce a work of art". I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing. But I could not do the work of writing a book, or even a long magazine article, if it were not also an aesthetic experience. Anyone who cares to examine my work will see that even when it is downright propaganda it contains much that a full-time politician would consider irrelevant. I am not able, and do not want, completely to abandon the world view that I acquired in childhood. So long as I remain alive and well I shall continue to feel strongly about prose style, to love the surface of the earth, and to take a pleasure in solid objects and scraps of useless information. It is no use trying to suppress that side of myself. The job is to reconcile my ingrained likes and dislikes with the essentially public, non-individual activities that this age forces on all of us.

It is not easy. It raises problems of construction and of language, and it raises in a new way the problem of truthfulness. Let me give just one example of the cruder kind of difficulty that arises. My book about the Spanish civil war, Homage to Catalonia, is of course a frankly political book, but in the main it is written with a certain detachment and regard for form. I did try very hard in it to tell the whole truth without violating my literary instincts. But among other things it contains a long chapter, full of newspaper quotations and the like, defending the Trotskyists who were accused of plotting with Franco. Clearly such a chapter, which after a year or two would lose its interest for any ordinary reader, must ruin the book. A critic whom I respect read me a lecture about it. "Why did you put in all that stuff?" he said. "You've turned what might have been a good book into journalism." What he said was true, but I could not have done otherwise. I happened to know, what very few people in England had been allowed to know, that innocent men were being falsely accused. If I had not been angry about that I should never have written the book.

In one form or another this problem comes up again. The problem of language is subtler and would take too long to discuss. I will only say that of late years I have tried to write less picturesquely and more exactly. In any case I find that by the time you have perfected any style of writing, you have always outgrown it. Animal Farm was the first book in which I tried, with full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole. I have not written a novel for seven years, but I hope to write another fairly soon. It is bound to be a failure, every book is a failure, but I do know with some clarity what kind of book I want to write.

Looking back through the last page or two, I see that I have made it appear as though my motives in writing were wholly public-spirited. I don't want to leave that as the final impression. All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand. For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention. And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one's own personality. Good prose is like a windowpane. I cannot say with certainty which of my motives are the strongest, but I know which of them deserve to be followed. And looking back through my work, I see that it is invariably where I lacked a political purpose that I wrote lifeless books and was betrayed into purple passages, sentences without meaning, decorative adjectives and humbug generally.
