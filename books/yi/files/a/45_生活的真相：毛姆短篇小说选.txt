潜　　逃


孔祥立　译





我一向确信，一旦一个女人下定决心要嫁给一个男人，那么使这个男人幸免于难的唯一方法，就是立刻逃之夭夭。但事情总有例外。我曾有一个朋友，眼瞅着这一不可避免的厄运朝他逼近，于是，他从一个港口登上了客轮一走了之（行囊里仅带了一把牙刷，他十分清楚自身面临的危险和这次紧急行动的必要性）。他花了整整一年的时间在世界各地游荡。当他认为自己已经安然无事时（女人是善变的，他说，十二个月的光阴足以让那个女人把他忘个干净），他返回了最初离开的那个港口，而他在码头上看到的第一个向他欣然招手的人，却还是那个他躲避、逃离一年之久的娇小女人。在此类情况下还能够抽身摆脱的，我仅认识一人，他叫罗杰·查林。跟露丝·巴罗陷入爱河时，罗杰已不再年轻，因而有了足够的经验让自己谨慎行事，但露丝有一种与生俱来的让男人乖乖就范的天赋（抑或称作素质？）。正是靠着这一点，她将罗杰拥有的常识、审慎，还有世俗智慧统统降服，他整个人如同九柱戏[1]中的一排木柱一样，噼里啪啦地倒下了——这种天赋就是让人心生怜悯。当过两次寡妇的巴罗夫人，有着一双黑漆漆的美目。我从未见过如此令人动容的眼睛，似乎每时每刻都有泪水要夺眶而出；这双眼睛让人觉得，这个世界对她来说，有着无法承受之重——你能感受到这一点。噢，可怜的人儿，她的不幸遭遇是任何人都无法忍受的。假如你像罗杰·查林一样，是个身强体壮又家财万贯的家伙，那你几乎无可避免地会对自己说：我一定要帮助一下这个孤独无依的小女人，让她远离那些人生的苦难。噢，如果能将这双楚楚动人的大眼睛里的忧伤拂去，那该是多么美妙的事情啊！我从罗杰那里得知，每个人都对巴罗夫人非常恶劣。她显然是那种诸事不顺的倒霉人儿中的一员。如果她结婚，丈夫会打她；如果她聘用经纪人，经纪人会骗她；如果她雇用一个厨师，这厨师会让她酗酒。她所珍爱的那些人，一个个都离她而去了。

当罗杰跟我说，他终于劝服了她同意跟自己结婚时，我祝他快乐。

“我希望你们能成为好朋友，”他说，“她有点儿怕你，你知道——她认为你这个人太冷淡。”

“真没想到，我不明白她怎么会这样想。”

“你真的喜欢她，是吧？”

“很喜欢。”

“她有段时间过得非常艰难，可怜人儿。我极其为她感到难过。”

“是的。”我说。

我的回答不能比这更简短了。我知道她很愚蠢，我认为她诡计多端，我坚信她是个冷酷无情的人。

第一次跟她见面时，我们一起打了桥牌。她是我的搭档，但两次动用王牌干掉了我最好的牌。打牌过程中，我表现得像个天使，但我不得不承认，如果有人眼睛里溢满了泪水，那个人只能是我，而不是她。那晚结束时，她输给我一大笔钱，她说会寄支票给我，但根本没寄。我只能想，下次见面时，带着可怜巴巴的表情的不是她，是我。

罗杰把她介绍给他的朋友，送她漂亮的珠宝，带她到这里、那里——没有不去的地儿。他们宣布婚礼将在不久后举行。罗杰感到非常快乐，他是在做一件好事，同时也是他喜欢的事。罗杰一直满足于独自一人，这时却热衷于与露丝在一起，确实非比寻常。

但突然间，他就不再爱她了，原因不得而知。不大可能是他厌倦了她的说话方式，因为她根本就不同人交流，或许只是——她那悲惨的表情已经不再能触动他的心弦。他的眼睛睁开了，他又重新成为曾经那个精明之人。他心里跟明镜似的，露丝·巴罗是下定决心要嫁给他了，但他庄严赌誓：没有任何东西能诱使他跟露丝·巴罗结婚。不过他的处境有些窘迫。现在，他重新恢复了自己的判断力，清楚地看到过去交往的是一个什么样的女人；他也明白，如果他请她主动放手的话，她一定会用她动人的方式去无限拔高所受到的情感伤害。再说，对一个男人来说，抛弃一个女人总是让人尴尬的，人们会倾向于认为他的行为有失检点。

罗杰决定保守自己的秘密。无论在言辞上还是姿态上，他都不让自己表露出对露丝·巴罗有任何的情感变化。他仍然留意着她所有的心愿，带她到饭店吃饭，陪她出去玩耍，送她鲜花，他依然讨人喜欢、魅力十足。他们决定，一旦找到适合他们的房子就立马结婚。之前他住的是单人套房，而她住的是带有家具的出租房，他们决定找一处合意的住宅。代理商寄给罗杰一些看房券，他带着露丝看了几套房子，但找到十分满意的房子很难。罗杰向更多的代理商提出了申请。他们看了一座又一座房子，看得甚是仔细，从地下室里的酒窖，到房顶下面的阁楼。有的房子太大，有的又太小了；有的离闹市太远，有的又太近了；有的过于昂贵，有的需要太多的修补；有的通气不佳，而有的室内风速过大；有的光线过暗，有的则一点儿遮蔽都没有。罗杰总能找到一处毛病，让房子不宜购买。他当然很难取悦，他怎么能忍心让他亲爱的露丝住在一套不完美的房子里呢？完美的房子是需要找的。找房是个累人的活儿，又让人烦心。不久，露丝开始焦躁起来。罗杰请她耐心些——在某个地方肯定有一套房子正是他们所渴望的，只需要再坚持一下，就一定能找到。他们找了几百套房子，爬了几千段楼梯，看过了难以尽数的厨房。露丝精疲力竭，不止一次动了肝火。

“如果你不能尽快找到房子，”她说，“我会再考虑我的想法的。哎呀，你老是这样，我们多少年也结不了婚。”

“不要说这样的话，”他回答，“我求你再耐心些。我刚刚收到一批全新的房源，都是最近刚认识的代理商提供的。他们手里至少有六十套房子。”

两人又开始了新一轮的求购，看的房子越来越多。他们已经找了两年啦！露丝的话越来越少，不时流露出轻蔑，她凄楚美丽的眼睛增添了一种愠怒的神色。人类的忍耐是有限度的，巴罗夫人有着天使般的耐心，但最终还是忍无可忍了。

“你到底想不想跟我结婚？”她问他。

她的话语里有一种异乎寻常的强硬，但这对他丝毫没有影响，他的回答仍然温文尔雅。

“我当然想啊。我们一找到房子就结婚。顺便告诉你，我刚听说有个房子，很适合我们。”

“我感觉不舒服，再也不想看什么房子了。”

“可怜的宝贝儿，恐怕是你太累了。”

露丝·巴罗病倒在床。她不愿再看到罗杰，罗杰倒是乐意前去她的住所看她，并给她带去鲜花。他像往常一样勤勉有加、殷勤备至。他每天给她写信，告诉她刚听说的房子。一星期过去了，罗杰收到了下面的信：





罗杰：

我认为你并没有真心爱我。我遇到了一个人，他愿意照顾我，我今天就同他结婚。

露丝





他派专人给她带去了回信。





露丝：

你的来信让我心碎，我永远都不能从这个打击中走出来，不过，你的幸福当然是我要首先考虑的。我给你寄去七张看房券，都是今天早上邮来的。我敢肯定，你一定能从中找到最适合你的房子。

罗杰

教堂司事


叶雷　译





那天下午，位于内维尔广场的圣彼得教堂刚结束了一场洗礼仪式，艾伯特·爱德华·福尔曼仍然身披司事长袍。长袍已经半旧，他倒是有一件新的，但专门留在葬礼或婚礼（社会名流常常选择在内维尔广场的圣彼得教堂举办这些仪式）上穿。他把那件新长袍叠得方正笔挺，仿佛它不是羊驼毛织物，而是一件传了千秋万代的青铜器。他春风得意地披着这件长袍，因为它光荣地象征着他的职位。一旦脱下它（回家前他不得不这么做），他总有点儿张皇失措，仿佛衣不蔽体。他为这件长袍劳神费心，亲手把它熨烫得平整顺滑。在这个教堂做司事的十六年间，他有过一件又一件这样的长袍，但穿坏时总也舍不得扔掉，而是全部拿牛皮纸整整齐齐地包好，放在卧房衣橱最底下的抽屉里。

司事默默地埋首工作，换掉了大理石圣水盘上的描漆木盖，拿走了一张专门为一位年迈体衰的老太太搬来的椅子。只需等牧师从更衣室出来，他进去打扫干净便能回家了。片刻之后，他看见牧师从圣坛前走过，对祭台微微屈了一下膝，沿耳堂走了过来。但他仍旧穿着法衣。

“他在那里磨蹭什么呢？”司事喃喃自语道，“难道他不知道我着急回家喝下午茶吗？”

这位新到任的牧师才四十出头，面色红润，干劲冲天。对于前任牧师，艾伯特·爱德华依然念兹在兹。那位老派的牧师，做起布道来总是从容不迫，清亮的声音宛如珍珠落玉盘，还频繁与身份高贵的教区居民共同外出用膳。他喜欢让教堂里的事物井然有序，但从不苛求，不像这个新任牧师，每件事都事必躬亲。不过，艾伯特·爱德华深谙隐忍之道。圣彼得教堂坐落于上等街区，教区居民高贵优雅，而新任牧师来自伦敦东区[1]，自然不能指望他立刻从这些贵族身上学会谨慎而得体的行事风度。

“瞧他那风风火火的轻浮样子！”艾伯特·爱德华说，“不过假以时日，他总会成熟起来的。”

牧师走下耳堂，走到不用抬高音量就能让司事听清楚的地方便停下脚步。教堂是肃穆神圣之地，不容许高声说话。

“福尔曼，你能到更衣室来一下吗？我有事情跟你说。”

“我现在就过去，先生。”

牧师等他走近，他们便一道穿过了教堂。

“我觉得这次洗礼仪式十分成功，先生。您一抱起婴儿，他就不哭了，真是厉害。”

“确实经常如此，我也注意到了，”牧师说，露出一丝微笑，“毕竟我处理这种场面也是个老手了。”

牧师一直为此暗暗自豪着。他知道把婴儿抱起来的窍门，知道怎样立刻止住婴儿啼哭。那些目睹披着白色法袍的牧师将抱在他臂弯中的婴儿安抚下来的母亲和保姆常常对他赞不绝口，对此，牧师也并非毫无意识。司事知道牧师喜欢听到别人夸赏他这一项天才的技能。

牧师把艾伯特·爱德华领进更衣室。艾伯特·爱德华发现里面坐着两位教会委员，小小地吃了一惊。他没看见他们进去。他们和蔼可亲地向他点头示意。

“午安，阁下。午安，先生。”他逐一问候两位教会委员。

两位教会委员可谓年高德劭。艾伯特当了多久司事，他们几乎就当了多久教会委员。此刻，他们正坐在一张端庄典雅的大餐桌旁，那是前任牧师许多年前从意大利带回来的。新牧师在两人之间的空椅子上坐下。艾伯特·爱德华隔着桌子面朝他们站着，微微有些不安，心下疑惑发生了什么事。他还记得有一次琴师闯了祸，他们是如何不惜一切代价把事情掩盖了起来。内维尔广场的圣彼得教堂是如此尊贵，绝对不能卷入丑闻。牧师的脸红彤彤的，温和的表情里，透着一丝尘埃落定后的安详，但两位教会委员的表情却略显不安。

“牧师刚才肯定一直对他们纠缠不休来着，肯定，”司事暗暗想道，“他诱使他们做出违心的事情。就是这样，我敢保证。”

但艾伯特·爱德华那张棱角分明的脸并没有出卖这些想法。他生就贵族般的容貌，此刻恭恭敬敬站在那里，不卑不亢。在觅得这份神职工作之前，他一直是名男仆，但他只在钟鸣鼎食之家当差，他的态度举止是无可挑剔的。最开始的时候，他在一个巨贾之家做杂役，一步步从四等男仆升为一等男仆。后来，他在一位高贵的寡妇家中当了一年男管家，家中大小事务一概任他处置。圣彼得教堂的职位空缺出来时，他正在一位退休大使的家里管事，手下有两个人。他高大瘦削，不苟言笑，威严持重，即使看起来不像一位公爵，至少也像一名专门扮演公爵角色的老派演员。他有心机，有魄力，有自信。雇主都对他称赏不已。

牧师爽快干脆地开了口。

“福尔曼，我们要跟你说一件非常尴尬的事情。你已经在这里工作了很多年，我想爵爷阁下和会长阁下与我意见一致，认为你在任期间出色地履行了职责，获得了众人的认可。”

两位教会委员点点头。

“但前几天我忽然发现了一个很严重的问题，我觉得自己有义务告知教会委员们。你竟然不识字，这实在是太令我惊讶了。”

司事面不改色。

“前任牧师也知晓这一情况，先生，”他回应道，“他说这无关痛痒。他总说这个世界上的教育实在多得令他难以承受。”

“我从未听说过如此惊人之事，”会长喊起来，“按您的意思，您在这里足足当了十六年司事，却未能学会读书写字？”

“我十二岁就出来当差了，先生。最初那户人家的厨师试过教我，但我学得云里雾里。后来我忙于生计，一直没有时间念书。我从没感觉到有念书的必要。我常常想，现在的年轻人念书念得实在太多，他们本可以用这些时间做更有意义的事情。”

“可是，难道您不关心新闻吗？”另一位教会委员说，“难道您从未动过写信的念头吗？”

“亲爱的阁下，虽然我不识字，但我自有办法。况且近几年报纸上满是照片，我很清楚这个世界上发生着什么事。我的妻子很是识得几个字，如果我需要写信，她会帮助我。而且，我对赛马和彩票之类的事情也不感兴趣。”

两位教会委员不安地瞥了牧师一眼，便低头看向桌子。

“是这样，福尔曼，我已经和这两位委员详细讨论过此事，他们也认为这简直是天方夜谭。内维尔广场的圣彼得教堂大名鼎鼎，绝不能聘请一个不识字的司事。”

艾伯特·爱德华瘦黄的脸涨得通红。他窘迫地挪动着双脚，一言不发。

“请你理解我的苦衷，福尔曼，我丝毫没有埋怨你的意思。你非常称职，人品和能力都无可挑剔。但你这种可悲的无知很有可能给我们带来难以预料的灾难，我们无权铤而走险。小心驶得万年船，而且这也是原则问题。”

“为什么您不能尝试学习一下呢，福尔曼？”会长问道。

“不，先生，恐怕不行，已经太迟了。您也知道，我已经上年纪了。如果我年轻时都记不住那些字，现在就更记不住了。”

“我们也不是要赶你走，福尔曼，”牧师说，“但委员们和我已经达成共识。我们会给你三个月时间，如果到时你没有任何改观，恐怕就要请你另谋高就了。”

对这位新牧师，艾伯特·爱德华从未萌生过好感。当初他们把圣彼得教堂交至他手中，艾伯特便明言这将铸成大错。这个教区如此高贵，他与之格格不入。艾伯特稍稍站直了一些。他也算得上是才德兼备，他要维护自己的尊严。

“非常抱歉，先生，恐怕那对我已经没有什么意义了。我已经过了学习新事物的年纪。这么多年来，我不识字也过得很好。我不想说我有多么了不起，那样做没什么意思。但平心而论，我很感谢仁慈的上帝安排我如此过活，而我也可谓兢兢业业。即使我现在能学会读书写字，也不愿意浪费时间。”

“如果你固执己见，福尔曼，恐怕这里容不下你了。”

“好的，先生，我非常理解。等您找到新人来接替我的位置，我马上递交辞呈。”

当艾伯特·爱德华在牧师和两位教会委员身后关上大门的时候，他的举止一如既往地恭敬有礼。然而，他无论如何也无法继续装出一副若无其事的模样来捍卫自己的尊严。他的嘴唇不住地颤抖。他拖着沉沉的脚步走回更衣室，把司事长袍挂在属于他的钩子上。它见证过无数豪华的葬礼和华丽的婚礼，一场场都历历在目。他叹了一口气。他把更衣室收拾得井然有序、一尘不染，披上大衣，拿起帽子，穿过耳堂，锁上教堂大门，转过身去。他魂不守舍地横越广场，悲不自胜。他没有走向那条通往他家的路，即便家中正有一杯上好的浓茶在等着他，他转入了错误的路口。他沿街缓缓而行，一颗心沉沉地直往下坠，不知何以自处。他并不想回去给富贵人家当差，毕竟他已经自己当家做主这么多年了，因为不论牧师和教会委员如何信口雌黄，这些年一直都是他在运营内维尔广场的圣彼得教堂，他怎么能再回去受那样的委屈。他确实存了一大笔钱，但迟早会坐吃山空，而且生活成本逐年攀高。他竟也要为此等事情焦心劳思！圣彼得教堂的司事本应是终身职位，就如罗马教皇一般。他常常幻想自己死后第一个礼拜日的场景，牧师将在晚祷时充满赞赏之情地追思他，说：艾伯特·爱德华·福尔曼于漫长之任职期间恪尽职守，谦恭守礼，其嘉言懿行，堪为模范。他喟然长叹。艾伯特·爱德华不沾烟酒，但他不是个不懂变通的人。也就是说，晚饭时可以喝一杯啤酒，精疲力竭之时也会抽烟解乏。他想，此时此刻一根香烟可以平复他的心情，但他没带烟在身上，便环顾四周，想找到一间出售金箔牌香烟的店铺。视线范围之内没有，他继续往前走。那是一条长长的街道，街上开满各色店铺，却独独没有香烟店。

“真是奇怪了。”艾伯特·爱德华说。

他折回去，重新走了一趟。确实没有香烟店。他站定了，若有所思地前后打量这条街。

“我不可能是唯一一个走在这条街上，同时又想买一包香烟的人。”他说，“要是有人在这里开一间小香烟店，难道不是非常有利可图吗？一间卖香烟和糖果的小店。”

他灵光一闪。

“这是个好机会，”他说，“真是意外收获。”

他转身回家喝茶。

“艾伯特，你怎么一声不吭的？”他妻子说。

“我在想事情。”他说。

他反复彻底地把这件事考虑清楚之后，第二天又到那条街去，幸运地觅得一家心仪的小店铺。二十四小时后，他租下了它。一个月后，艾伯特·爱德华·福尔曼永远地离开内维尔广场的圣彼得教堂，开创了自己的事业，成为一名烟草商和报刊经销商。他妻子说，作为堂堂的教堂司事，此等行径简直是堕落无耻。但他回应说，人不得不跟上潮流，教堂已然不是从前的教堂，今后他要自食其力。香烟店大获成功，仅仅过了一年左右，他就发现自己可以开一间分店，聘一位经理来打理。他另觅没有香烟店的长街，正巧碰上一家店铺招租，便租下来，备足货。分店也获利丰厚。于是他想，他既然能开一家分店，为什么不干脆多开几家，便开始在伦敦四处走动，每发现一条既没有香烟店又有店铺招租的长街，就把店铺租下来。十年间，他开了不下十间分店，日进斗金。他每周一去各间分店巡视一番，收取每周的进款，把它们存入银行。

一天早上，他正要把一大捆钞票和一大包沉沉的银币存入银行，司库说经理想见他。他被引进一间办公室，经理忙上前跟他握手。

“福尔曼先生，我想跟您谈谈您在我们银行的存款。请问您知道具体数目吗？”

“确切的数字说不上来，先生，但我知道大概有多少。”

“不计您今天的存款，目前共有三万英镑出头。把这样一笔巨款存在银行不太上算，我建议您拿去投资。”

“我不想冒险，先生。我知道把它们存在银行很安全。”

“您完全可以放心。我们会给您列出一份保证收益的金边债券名单。收益率比存在我们银行要高得多。”

福尔曼先生那张贵族般的脸上露出困惑的表情。“我从未接触过股票债券之类的，这要麻烦您全权处理了。”他说。

经理微笑道：“我们会竭尽所能。下次您只要来签署委托书即可。”

“这倒不难，”艾伯特犹疑地说，“但我怎么知道您让我签的是什么？”

“我想您应该会先看看委托书的内容。”经理说，语气中隐隐地透出一丝尖刻。

福尔曼先生向经理微微一笑，打消他的疑虑。

“先生，事实上，我不识字。我知道这听起来很奇怪，但事实就是这样，我是个文盲。我只会写自己的名字，而且是为了做生意才学会的。”

经理惊讶得从椅子上跳了起来。

“我这辈子从未听说过如此不可思议的事情。”

“就是这样，先生。我一直没机会学识字，等到有机会，出于某个原因，我却不愿意学了。我有点儿倔。”

经理盯着他，仿佛他是一只史前怪兽。

“您是说，您不识字，却把生意做得这么大，还积攒起一笔三万英镑的财富？天啊，要是您识字，现在该从事多么了不起的事业啊！”

“我还真知道答案，先生。”福尔曼先生说，他那一如既往的高贵的脸上挂着一丝微笑，“那样的话，我现在会在内维尔广场的圣彼得教堂任职司事。”

生活的真相


孔祥立　译





亨利·加内特有个习惯，下午离开商业区后，都要先到俱乐部打会儿桥牌，然后才回家吃饭。他是个不错的牌友，牌技精湛，总能把手中的牌发挥运用到极致。他同时还是个输得起的玩家，获胜了，就把胜利归因于好运，而不是自己牌技好。牌桌上，他宽容有加，倘若搭档犯了错误，放心好了，他会为他开脱的。于是这一次，当大伙儿听到他厉声呵斥搭档，说他从未见过谁打牌这么烂时，着实感到惊讶。更让人吃惊的是，他不仅自己犯了大错——一个你绝对想不到他可能会犯的低级错误，而且当他的搭档想回敬一下，给他指出来时，他还蛮不讲理、火气十足，说自己的出牌完全没有问题。好在一起打牌的都是老朋友，谁也没把他的坏情绪当回事。亨利·加内特是名经纪人，也是一家著名公司的合伙人，其中一位牌友突然想到，是不是他感兴趣的股票出了什么问题。

“今天股市怎么样啊？”他问。

“暴涨。连笨蛋都能赚钱。”

显然，亨利·加内特的烦恼跟股市、股票没有关系，一定是遇到了什么麻烦事。他是个健壮的家伙，身体素质极佳，手里的钱多得花不完，他深爱着自己的妻子，对孩子而言也是个称职的好父亲。他通常是个兴致颇高的人，打牌时大家常谈到的一些无聊话题，都能轻易让他开怀大笑。不过今天，他坐在那里闷闷不乐，一声不吭，眉头紧皱，面露愠色。片刻之后，为了缓解紧张的气氛，一位牌友提及了一个大伙儿都知道亨利·加内特乐意谈论的话题。

“你儿子现在怎么样啊，亨利？我看他在联赛中表现得不错嘛。”

亨利·加内特本来皱着的眉头皱得更深了。

“比我预期的差多了。”

“他什么时候从蒙特回来呀？”

“他昨晚已经回来了。”

“他过得开心吗？”

“我看是开心，不过他丢人丢到家了。”

“嗯，怎么啦？”

“如果你们不介意的话，我不想谈论这个话题。”

三个男人好奇地打量他，亨利·加内特则绷着脸看着那张绿色的台面。

“对不起，老伙计，该你叫牌喽。”

牌局在紧张的沉默中继续进行。加内特叫了牌，不过打得极糟糕，连输三墩，如此一来，他整个人更是一声不吭了。又一轮比赛开始了，第二局，加内特一张牌也没出。

“没牌吗？”搭档问。

加内特有些气急败坏，根本没搭理他。最后摊牌时，大家发现他有牌不跟，违反了规则，算是输了牌。对他这样的浮皮潦草，搭档再不说几句就不像话了。

“亨利，真见鬼，你到底怎么回事？”他说，“打个牌像傻瓜一样。”

加内特有些窘迫。自己输上一轮倒是无所谓，让他痛苦的是，他的心不在焉让搭档也跟着输了。他强打起精神。

“还是别打了，我本以为打上几轮能平复一下心情，但我实在没法将心思放在桥牌上。说真的，我心情糟透了。”

大伙儿哄堂大笑起来。

“你不用说的，老伙计，大家都能看出来。”

加内特可怜巴巴地朝他们笑了笑。

“我笃定，要是我遭遇的事情发生在你们身上，你们肯定也会大发脾气的。说真的，我现在的境况尴尬得要命，你们谁能给我一点儿建议的话，我将感激不尽。”

“咱们先喝一杯你再说吧。这里有王室法律顾问，有内政部官员，还有著名的外科医生——如果连我们都给不了你建议，就没人能给了。”

法律顾问站了起来，按铃让侍者过来。

“是我那个浑蛋小子。”加内特开口道。

酒很快端上来了。接下来加内特给他们讲述了事情的前因后果。

他所讲的那个孩子是他唯一的儿子，尼古拉斯，当然大家都称其为尼基，今年十八岁了。他还有两个女儿，一个十六岁，一个十二岁。一般来讲，父亲会更偏爱女儿一些，但加内特却一反常理，在他内心，无疑对儿子的关爱更多一些。尽管他竭尽全力不表现出这种偏爱。他以一种毛毛躁躁、随随便便的方式对待两个女儿，到了生日和圣诞节，就给她们买上一大堆的礼物；对于儿子，他则溺爱有加——可谓捧在手里怕掉了，含在嘴里怕化了。这个你不能怪他，有尼基这样一个儿子，任何一对父母都会引以自豪的。他身高六英尺两英寸，动作敏捷，身体强健，肩宽腰细，身材挺拔、健美。他长着一副迷人的面孔，跟他宽宽的肩膀非常相配，一头微微拳曲的浅褐色头发，两道浓眉下面是又黑又长的睫毛和蓝色的眼珠儿；嘴巴饱满、红润，皮肤光洁、呈棕褐色；开口一笑，露出整齐而洁白的牙齿。尼基遇人从不扭捏，一举一动尽显低调和谦虚，甚是招人喜爱。在社会交往中，他从容不迫，彬彬有礼，文静愉快。他就是那种正派、健康、体面的父母生出的孩子，在良好的家庭环境中长大，就读于上等学校，最终成了一个青年男子的楷模——这样魅力十足的小伙子很少见。你能感觉到他的诚实、坦率和善良，表里如一。他从来就没让父母担心过。幼儿时期，他很少生病，从不调皮捣蛋。少年时代，也没做过出格的事，学习成绩名列前茅。在学校里他极受欢迎，担任了学生领袖和足球队队长，到毕业时已获得无数奖项。不仅如此，十四岁那年，尼基在草地网球[1]上显露了出人意料的天赋。对于这项运动，他的父亲不仅喜欢，还很擅长。当他发现尼基在这方面大有潜力可挖时，便开始着手培养他。假期里，他请来最好的职业选手来教他练球。到十六岁时，他已获得了若干个少年锦标赛的冠军了。现在把他父亲击败已是小菜一碟，要不是出于对孩子的慈爱，这个老选手真的没办法面对自己糟糕的表现了。十八岁时，尼基上了剑桥大学，亨利·加内特踌躇满志，认为儿子在读书期间就能成为剑桥大学网球队的一名成员了。尼基具备成为一名伟大网球选手的所有条件。他个子高，臂展长，步子灵活，反应敏捷，能本能地判断球的落点，然后看似不慌不忙就把球击回去。他的发球凶狠有力，让对手难以招架。他的正手又低又远，落点刁钻，极具杀伤力。相比较而言，他的反手稍差，截击球缺乏章法，但在进入剑桥大学前的整个暑假，亨利·加内特请来全英国最好的教练来帮他改进了这些不足。尽管没有向尼基提及，但加内特的内心深处有一个更大的抱负，他希望儿子能够参加温布尔登网球锦标赛[2]，说不定儿子还能进入国家队参加戴维斯杯[3]的比赛呢。当他幻想看到儿子跳过球网，跟刚刚被他击败的美国冠军握手，然后走出场地，接受全场观众震耳欲聋的欢呼声时，他的喉咙似乎被什么大块的东西哽住了。

作为温布尔登网球锦标赛勤勉的常客，亨利·加内特在网球界有众多朋友。一天晚上，在参加工商界的一次宴会时，他发现身边坐着的是网球界的一个朋友——布拉巴宗上校。他适时地跟他聊起了尼基，聊到他下赛季有没有机会代表剑桥大学参加比赛。

“你怎么不让他去参加明年的蒙特卡洛春季锦标赛[4]呢？”上校突然问道。

“哦，参加这样的比赛，我觉得他水平还不够。他还没满十九岁呢，去年十月才入读剑桥。就算去了，也没机会跟那些强手对垒。”

“当然，奥斯汀和冯·克拉姆那些人会轻松地击败他，但他也许能赢上一两局。如果碰上些弱一点儿的选手，赢上两三场比赛也不是没有可能。他从没跟一流选手交过手，这对他来说是个难得的锻炼机会。在那里学到的东西会比你安排他参加的那些海滨比赛多得多。”

“这个我从没想过，我不想让他中途辍学离开剑桥。我一直在教导他，网球只是个游戏，不能影响了学习。”

布拉巴宗上校问尼基这学期何时结束，加内特告诉了他。

“那没问题，他只需要耽搁三天时间就够了。这肯定是可以安排好的。你看，我们的两位主力选手让我们感到失望，我们正发愁呢。我们想要派一支最强大的队伍参加比赛，德国人、美国人也都是如此。”

“不妥不妥，老伙计。首先，尼基还不够优秀，其次呢，派一个小孩子到蒙特卡洛参加比赛，又没人照顾他，这个想法不合适。如果我能前去的话，还可以考虑一下，但我脱不了身呀。”

“我会在那儿的。我将担任英国队的不上场队长。我会照顾他的。”

“你太忙了，再说，这也不是你应当承担的义务，我不想麻烦你。说实话，尼基从没到过国外，他在那里的时候，我不会有片刻安宁的。”

话题就此打住了，不久后，亨利·加内特回了家。布拉巴宗上校的话让他受宠若惊，他忍不住把这件事告诉了妻子。

“真想不到，他会认为尼基这样优秀。他跟我说，他见过尼基打球，他的打球方式很不错。只要多加磨炼，就一定能成为一流的网球选手。老婆，我们会看到这个孩子在温布尔登打半决赛的！”

让他吃惊的是，加内特夫人对这个建议并没有像他想象的那样坚决反对。

“不管怎样，尼基都十八岁了，从没捅过什么篓子，没理由认为他到了那里就会出差错。”

“别忘了，还得考虑他的功课问题。到学期末了，再让他耽误课程，这会开一个很坏的先例。”

“就三天时间，有什么要紧？让他错失这样的好机会，才实属遗憾。你把这件事告诉他，我敢肯定，他会高兴得蹦起来的。”

“咳，我才不会告诉他。我让他上剑桥可不只是去打球的。我知道这孩子很稳当，但故意用诱惑物来刺激他是很愚蠢的。他还太年轻，不能让他一个人去蒙特卡洛。”

“你是说他没机会跟那些一流球员对阵吗？这你可说不准！”

亨利·加内特微微叹了口气。刚才在回家路上，他坐在车里突然想到，奥斯汀健康状况不明，冯·克拉姆则告了假，假如——当然只是说说而已，尼基能沾上一点儿这样的好运气，毫无疑问他将会入选剑桥大学网球队去打比赛了。不过，这肯定是无稽之谈。

“什么也别做，亲爱的。我主意已定，不会更改的。”

加内特夫人没有吭声。但第二天她给尼基写信，把这件事告诉了他，并跟他讲，如果他希望征得父亲的同意去参加比赛的话该如何如何去做，换作她，她就会那样做。一两天后，亨利·加内特收到了儿子的来信。在信中，他抑制不住自己的兴奋，说自己去找了导师和院长。导师也是一名网球选手，院长碰巧认识布拉巴宗上校，对于他学期结束前离校他们都不反对，并且他们都认为去蒙特卡洛参加比赛是个难得的好机会，不应错过。他还说，去参加一下比赛也没什么坏处；如果这一次——仅就这一次，他父亲愿意让步的话，他诚心诚意地保证，下学期他会拼命搞好学习的。信写得很漂亮，在早餐桌上，加内特夫人看着丈夫读信，看到他脸上由晴转阴，但她仍泰然自若，不动声色。信读罢了，加内特把它丢给了妻子。

“我就搞不懂为什么你非要把我私下跟你说的事告诉尼基。你这人太差了！现在可好，你让他整个人都心神不宁了！”

“对不起，我以为如果让他知道布拉巴宗上校对他如此欣赏，他会很开心的。我不明白，为什么只能给人们转告那些令人不快的议论呢？当然，我的意思已经表达得很清楚了，他不可能去的。”

“你让我陷入了进退两难的境地。要说有任何事让我恨之入骨，那就是让这个孩子觉得我是个扫兴的人，一个独断专行的人。”

“哦，他绝不会这么想的。他可能认为你很愚蠢，不通情理，但我肯定他会懂得，你这样绝情只是为了他好。”

“老天！”亨利·加内特叫道。

他的妻子差点儿笑出声来。她知道这场战斗已经胜利了。哎哟，哎哟哟，要让男人们按照你的意愿去做事，真是再简单不过啦！但为了面子，亨利·加内特在接下来的四十八个小时里仍坚持己见，但接着他就妥协让步了。两周后，尼基回到了伦敦。第二天一早，他就要去蒙特卡洛了。吃完晚饭，加内特夫人和大女儿离开后，亨利借机对儿子叮嘱一番。

“你年龄还小，让你一个人去蒙特卡洛这种地方，我很不放心。”他接着说道，“既然要去，我只希望你凡事要多加留意。在你面前我不想扮演一个严父的角色，但有三件事我要特别警告你不要沾染，一是赌博，不要赌钱；二是金钱，不要把钱借给任何人；三是女人，不要跟女人有任何瓜葛。如果你不沾染这三样东西，你就不会倒霉，所以你要记好了。”

“好的，爸爸。”尼基笑眯眯地说道。

“我就跟你说这些。这个世道我是相当了解的，你要相信我的话，我的建议对你有好处。”

“我不会忘的，我保证。”

“这才是个好小子。现在我们上楼看看你妈妈和妹妹吧。”

在蒙特卡洛锦标赛上，尼基败在了奥斯汀和冯·克拉姆手下，但他的表现也不丢人。他出人意料地击败了一名西班牙选手，跟一名奥地利选手打得难解难分，这在任何人看来，都是难以想象之事。在混双比赛中，他进入了半决赛。他的魅力征服了每一个人，他自己也尽享比赛带给他的快乐。这是个前途无量的选手，他得到了人们普遍的认可。布拉巴宗上校告诉他，等他再长大一点儿，跟那些一流选手多加切磋，他就会成为父亲的骄傲了。锦标赛结束了，第二天，尼基就要飞回伦敦。在此之前，因为渴望在比赛中发挥出最佳水平，他生活得非常小心，滴酒不沾，烟抽得很少，每晚早早上床。但在蒙特卡洛的最后一个晚上，他觉得应该去了解一下这个城市的生活——关于这里的情况，他以前听过太多太多了。官方为网球选手们举行了招待宴会。宴会结束后，尼基跟其他一些选手一起去了体育俱乐部。这样的地方他还是第一次来。蒙特卡洛是个非常拥挤的城市，俱乐部的各个房间都人满为患。以前除了在电影中，尼基还从未见过轮盘赌。现在，他迷迷糊糊地在第一张桌子前停下了。绿色的布料桌面上，乱七八糟地摊放着些大小不等的赌注筹码。赌台管理员猛地把轮盘转动起来，再轻轻一弹，把一个小白球掷入了轮盘里。似乎过了一万年，小球终于停下来了，又上来一名管理员，他张开大大的双臂，带着冷漠的表情，把输者的筹码一股脑儿地拢了过去。

片刻后，尼基又溜达到一个叫“红与黑”的纸牌游戏那里，不过他搞不懂怎么个玩法，觉得有些无聊。他看到另一个房间里挤满了人，便踅了进去。一场巴卡拉纸牌大战正在进行，他立刻被那股紧张劲儿给攫住了。为保护玩家，专门安装了一根铜栏杆把他们跟蜂拥而来的看客分开。玩家围着赌桌坐下，每边九个人，发牌的人坐在中间，管理人跟他相对而坐。大额的钞票正在易手。发牌的人是希腊财团的成员，尼基看了他一眼，见他面无表情，目不转睛盯着桌面，无论输赢都不动声色。这一幕让人感到恐怖、怪诞，但给人的印象太深了。尼基从小到大都节省惯了，看到有人为张纸牌就掏出一千英镑，输了钱开个小玩笑，便一笑了之，这让他感到莫名兴奋，这真是太刺激了！一个熟人向他走了过来。

“手气如何？”他问。

“我没玩。”

“还是你聪明，都是些堕落的玩意儿。走，去喝一杯吧。”

“好呀。”

饮酒时，尼基告诉朋友，他这是第一次到赌场来。

“哦，那你走前一定得小赌一把。傻瓜才会不试试运气就离开蒙特卡洛。不管怎样，输个百八十英镑也没什么大不了的。”

“我觉得也没啥，不过，我父亲对这次来蒙特卡洛不怎么热心，有三件事他要我一定不要沾，其中之一就是赌钱。”

不过，尼基和朋友分手后，又逛回到一张正在进行轮盘赌的桌子前。他站着看了一会儿，看到管理员把输者的钱拿过去，然后交给赢者。真是令人心旌摇荡，这个没法否认。朋友说得对，不试上一把就离开蒙特卡洛，真是傻透了。这将是一种经历呀，在他这个年龄，什么都得体验一下才行。他记得并没有向父亲保证不赌，只是说不会忘记他的建议。两者不完全是一回事，不是吗？他从口袋里掏出一张百元法郎的钞票，羞怯怯地压在了十八号筹码上。他选择这个号码，是因为他十八岁。他看着转盘转起来，心脏怦怦跳个不停。小白球像个搞恶作剧的小鬼，嗖嗖地转动着。转盘慢下来了，小白球也转得犹犹豫豫的，眼看着似乎要停下了，不料又滚动起来。最后，小白球终于停下来了，落进了十八号洞里——尼基看呆了，简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。一大堆的筹码都推到了他的面前，他双手哆哆嗦嗦地把钱扒了过来。看上去钱不少啊！这时，他头脑已经迷糊，赌下一轮时根本没想到押什么赌注，事实上，他真的不想赌了，一次就够了。当小白球又一次落在十八号上时，他惊讶极了。这一次，十八号就一个筹码。

“哎呀！你又赢了。”旁边站着的一个人叫道。

“我赢了？我没下注啊！”

“不，你下过了。就是你上一轮的筹码。除非你要求收回来，否则，他们就以为这个筹码一直有效。这个你都不懂？”

又一堆的筹码交给了他。尼基开始头晕目眩起来。他数了数所赢的钱，足足七千法郎！他被一种奇怪的力量控制住了，他觉得自己真是聪明绝顶。这是最轻松的赚钱方式了，以前都没听说过。他坦率、迷人的脸上笑意盈盈，灿烂如花。这时，他炯炯有神的目光跟旁边站着的一位姑娘的目光相遇了。姑娘冲他莞尔一笑。

“你运气真好！”她说。

她讲的是英语，但带着异国腔调。

“简直让人难以相信。我第一次玩这个。”

“所以你能赢钱啊。能不能借我一千法郎呀？我的钱都输光了。半小时后我就还你。”

“没问题。”

她从他那一堆筹码里抽出一根红色的大筹码，说了声谢谢，然后转眼就不见了。这时，先前跟他说话的那个男子嘟囔道：

“你再也不会见到她了。”

尼基很懊恼。他父亲曾特别告诫他不要借钱给任何人。自己干了件多么大的蠢事，把钱借给了一个素昧平生的人！不过那一刻的真实情况是，他觉得自己对整个人类充满了爱意，这样一个要求他从未想过拒绝。再说那个大红筹码，他几乎想不到到底有什么价值。嗨，得啦，他不是还有六千法郎吗？他准备再试上一两次，如果不成，就回去好了。这一次，他把筹码压在了十六号上——这是他妹妹的年龄，但没赢。然后他又压了十二号——他小妹妹的年龄，还是没赢。接下来他胡乱试了几个不同的号码，仍然无一成功。太滑稽了，看起来他的赢钱秘诀不管用了。这时他想，他再试最后一次，然后就收手。这一次，他赢啦！不仅挽回了所有损失，还有盈余。一小时的时间，跌宕起伏，成败斗转，这种惊心动魄他真是从未体验过。他发现自己的筹码已经多到口袋都装不下了，于是他决心离开。他走到了兑换处。当看到两万法郎的纸币放在眼前时，他感到呼吸都出现了困难。他有生以来从未拥有过这么多钱。他把钱装进了口袋准备离开，这时，跟他借一千法郎的那个姑娘向他走过来。

“我到处找你，”她说，“我担心你已经走了呢，正急得不得了。要不，你会把我想成什么人哪！这是还你的一千法郎，非常感谢你借钱给我。”

尼基的脸一下子变得绯红，惊讶地盯着她。真是错怪她了！他父亲说过，不要赌博，他赌了，还赚了两万法郎。他父亲还说，不要借钱给任何人。咳，他借了，把一大笔钱借给了一个素未谋面的陌生人，不过她还回来了。事实上，他并不像他父亲想的那样傻：他有种本能的预感，他可以借钱给她，而且不会有什么问题。你瞧，他的本能没错吧？他吃惊的神情毫无遮拦，让这个长相小巧的女子有些忍俊不禁起来。

“你怎么了？”她问。

“说真的，我真没想到钱还能还回来。”

“你把我当什么人啦？你认为我是个贱女人吗？”

尼基的脸唰地红了，红到了鬈发的发梢处。

“没有，我当然不会这样想。”

“我看起来像吗？”

“一点儿不像。”

她的穿着很是娴静。一袭青衣，脖子上挂着一串金珠。朴素的上衣使她看上去整洁利索，身材纤细。她长着一张漂亮的小脸蛋儿，头发梳理得一丝不乱，上了妆，但不浓不淡，恰到好处。尼基觉得她顶多比自己大上三四岁。她冲他友好地笑了笑。

“我丈夫在摩洛哥的政府部门任职，我来蒙特卡洛已经几周了，因为他认为，我需要换换环境。”

“我就要走了。”尼基说道，因为他实在找不到其他话题。

“要走了吗？”

“是的，明天我要早起，然后坐飞机回伦敦。”

“当然了。锦标赛今天结束了嘛，不是吗？你知道，我看你的比赛了，看了两三次。”

“你看了？我不知道你怎么会注意到我呢。”

“你打得漂亮呀！你穿上短裤很好看。”

尼基不是个傲慢的人，但这时他脑海中掠过的是，她向他借走一千法郎，或许只是为了想跟他结识而已。

“你去过尼克博克舞厅吗？”她问。

“没有，从没去过。”

“嗯，没去过那里，你怎么能离开蒙特卡洛呢？干吗不去跳一曲呢？说实话，我快饿死了，很想去那里吃点儿熏肉和鸡蛋。”

尼基记得父亲说过，不要跟女人有任何瓜葛，但这回不同呀。这是个娇小俏丽的女子，你只需看上一眼就会觉得，她完全是个正派的女人。他估计，她丈夫是在相当于文官部的政府部门工作。尼基的父母有一些文官朋友。那些人和他们的太太们有时会到尼基家做客。跟这个女子相比，那些太太既不年轻，也不漂亮，但她跟她们一样贤淑高雅。现在既然赢了两万法郎，稍作娱乐也不是坏事。

“我愿意跟你一起去，”他说，“不过，我待不了太久，希望你不要介意。我给宾馆留了纸条，让他们明早七点叫醒我。”

“你想几点离开就几点离开。”

尼基在尼克博克舞厅玩得很开心。他胃口大开，吃了熏肉和鸡蛋。两人一起分享了一瓶香槟，一起跳了舞。这个娇小的贵妇告诉他，他舞跳得很优美。他知道自己很会跳舞，当然跟她跳舞很轻松。她舞姿轻盈，翩翩如羽毛。他们的面颊贴在了一起，当两人的目光相遇时，他看到她笑意盈盈，他的心脏怦怦跳个不停。一个黑人女子用嘶哑的嗓音唱着一首色情歌曲。舞厅里挤满了人。

“有没有人告诉你，你长得很帅啊？”她问。

“应该没有。”他笑了，心想，“老天！我相信她看上我了。”

尼基不是傻瓜，当然知道经常有女人喜欢他。当她说这话的时候，他把她搂得更紧了些。她闭上了眼睛，嘴里轻轻发出了一声叹息。

“我想，如果我在大庭广众之下吻你的话，不太妥吧？”他问。

“你觉得他们会怎样看我呢？”

夜色更深了，尼基说他真的该走了。

“我也要走，”她说，“你顺路把我送回宾馆好吗？”

尼基付了账，所付钱数之多让他吃了一惊。不过他口袋里有一大把钱，他才不在乎呢。两人钻进了一辆出租车。她紧紧地偎依着他，他吻了她，她看起来很喜欢。

“天哪！”他想，“不会发生什么事吧？”

她是个已婚女子，这没错，不过，她丈夫远在摩洛哥，而且她看起来真的爱上他了，完完全全爱上了他。他父亲的确告诫他不要跟女人有任何纠缠，但他又一次想到，他并没有答应呀，他只是说不会忘了他的建议——是哦，他没忘，这一刻还记着呢。但是具体情况具体分析嘛。她是个可爱的小尤物，就像一盘菜一样端到了你的面前，这样的奇遇如果都错过了，那不是傻透了吗？到宾馆了，尼基付了车费。

“我要步行回去，”他说，“舞厅的空气太闷热，呼吸一下外面的空气对我有好处。”

“上楼坐一会儿吧，”她说，“我给你看看我儿子的照片。”

“哦，你有儿子吗？”尼基吃了一惊，问道。他感到有点儿沮丧。

“是的，一个很可爱的小男孩。”

尼基跟在她后面上了楼。他根本不想看她儿子的什么照片，不过出于礼节，他觉得还得装作像那么回事。他担心自己丢丑了。他突然想到，她带他到楼上看照片，是想用一种巧妙的方式告诉他，他搞错了。他曾告诉她，他只有十八岁。

“我想她只是把我当成孩子了。”

他后悔在夜总会把那么多钱花在了香槟上。

不过，她根本没有给他看她儿子的照片。一进房间，她就向他转过身来，张开双臂搂住了他的脖子，把他整个嘴都吻住了。他有生以来从来没经历过如此激烈的热吻。

“宝贝儿。”她喃喃道。

在那一瞬间，父亲的话再一次掠过他的脑际，但随即消失了。





尼基是个睡眠不深的人，最轻微的声音都能把他从睡梦中惊醒。两三个小时后，他醒过来了。那一刻，他搞不清自己到底在哪里。房间里不是很黑，因为浴室的房门没有关，里面的灯还亮着。突然，他意识到，房间里有人在走动，于是他想起自己在哪里了。他看到了自己身材娇小的朋友，正要开口说话，但她奇怪的举止让他把话咽了下去。她走路蹑手蹑脚，仿佛怕吵醒他似的，有一两次她停下来，看了看床上的尼基。他很纳闷她在寻找什么，不过，很快他就明白了。她走到他挂衣服的椅子边，然后又朝他的方向看了看。接下来，她就在那里等着。在尼基看来，时间过去了很久很久。房间里如此静寂、如此紧张，他似乎都能听到自己的心跳声。这时，她慢慢地、悄无声息地拿起了他的外套，把手伸进了里面的口袋，把尼基所赢的钱都掏了出来——那些令尼基倍感骄傲的漂亮大钞，都是一千法郎一张的！然后，她把外套又放回了椅子上，上面又放了些其他衣服，这样就看不出有人动过了。她手里拿着那把钞票，一动不动站在那里，过了很久很久。尼基压制住本能的冲动，没有跳起来把钱从她手里夺过来。一方面是因为发生的意外使他愣住了，另一方面是他意识到，他是在一家陌生的宾馆，身处一个陌生的国度，如果闹出事来，不知道会发生什么情况。她看了看他。他的眼睛半睁半合，他敢肯定，她认为他是睡着了。在周围一片静谧之中，她不会听不到他均匀的呼吸的。当她再次确定她的行为没有惊醒他后，她极其小心地走到了房间的另一端。靠窗的小桌子上长着一盆富贵菊。尼基现在睁开了眼睛瞅着她。盆里栽花的土壤显然很松，因为她抓住花茎一把就把花连根拔出了。她把纸币放在了花盆的底部，然后又把花放了回去。真是个绝妙的藏钱地方啊！在光艳艳的鲜花下面，谁能想到会别有洞天呢？她用手指把土压好了，然后，小心翼翼地不发出任何声音，慢慢地猫着腰走回来，钻进了被窝。

“心肝儿[5]。”她柔声喊道。

尼基的呼吸很平稳，像一个沉睡中的人。这个小巧玲珑的女人翻过身去，进入了梦乡。尼基尽管纹丝不动，却思绪翻滚。目睹刚才的一幕，他怒火中烧，头脑中激烈地思忖：“这个臭婊子！还说她的什么儿子，她在摩洛哥的丈夫，真他妈的扯淡！她就是个烂贼，一点儿没错！拿我当笨蛋呢！如果认为这就把钱偷走了，想都别想。”

这笔靠自己的聪明劲儿得来的钱怎么花，他已经打定了主意。他很早就想拥有一辆属于自己的汽车了。他觉得父亲不给自己买车，实在太抠门。不管怎么说，有哪个小伙子愿意整天坐着家用汽车到处跑的。喏，现在他要给老头子一个教训：他要给自己买车了！花上两万法郎——大约两百英镑，就可以买一辆相当体面的二手车！他要把钱弄回来，不过这一刻，他不知道怎么办才好。他不想把事情闹大。在这里他人生地不熟，对这个宾馆一无所知，而且这个烂女人很可能会有同伙。要公开打架他无所谓，谁来都行，但万一有人拿枪对着他，那就不太好玩喽。另外，他明智地想到，他没有证据证明这笔钱是他的。到了紧要关头，如果女人赌咒说钱是她的，他很可能会被带到警察局去。对此他感到束手无策。现在，这个小女人的呼吸变得均匀起来，尼基知道她睡着了。她这事干得漂亮，一定心定神安地进入了梦乡。看着她安然地做着美梦，而自己两眼圆睁地躺在那里，忧惧得要死，这让尼基气炸了肺。突然，他灵机一动，想到一个好主意。主意之妙使他差点儿从床上蹦下来立马行动，但他还是竭力控制住了自己。以其人之道还治其人之身。既然她把钱偷了去，自己可以再偷回来，彼此彼此嘛！他打定主意，一定要先按兵不动，等到那个女骗子完全睡熟了再动手。他等了很久很久。她一动不动，呼吸均匀，像个孩子。

“亲爱的。”他终于喊了一声。

没有回答，没有动弹。她睡得跟死人无异。尼基开始慢慢地行动，每动一下都停一停，最后悄无声息地下了床。他先是静静地站了一会儿，看看有没有把她惊醒。她的呼吸平稳如初。停顿的时候，他仔细看了看房间里家具的位置，以免走过去时撞翻了椅子或桌子而发出声响。他走了几步，停下来，再走几步，又停下来。他的步子很轻，没发出任何声音。用了足足五分钟的时间，他才走到窗前，然后又等了一会儿。这时，床突然吱呀轻声响了一下，他吃了一惊，但女人只是翻了下身。尼基强令自己再等一等，他开始数数，一直数到一百。女人仍纹丝不动，睡得像根木头。他极其小心地抓住富贵菊的花茎，把它从花盆里轻轻地拔了出来。他把另一只手伸进盆里，当手指碰到纸币时，他的心狂跳不已。他用手抓住那些钱，慢慢地掏出来。然后，再把花放回盆里，这回轮到他小心地把土压紧了。做这一切时，他一直用一只眼睛睃着床上的那个女人。一切安然如故。停顿了片刻后，他蹑手蹑脚走到挂衣服的椅子旁，把那卷钱放到外套的口袋里，然后开始穿衣服。他花了足足一刻钟才把衣服穿好，因为他不能弄出任何声响。尼基晚礼服的里面一直穿着一件质地柔软的衬衣，他为此感到庆幸，这样的衬衣穿起来，声音比那些粗硬的衬衣小多了。不过，房间里没有镜子，在系领带时，他遇到了些麻烦。但他聪明地想到，系不好有什么要紧呢？他整个人开始兴奋起来。现在，这件事更像是一场恶作剧了。最后，除了鞋子没穿，一切都穿戴整齐了。他手里提着鞋子，决定到走廊上再穿。现在他要穿过房间到门口去。他悄悄地走过去，声音极小，睡眠再浅的人也不可能被惊动。然而，房门必须要打开，他缓缓地转动钥匙。钥匙咯吱响了一下。

“谁啊？”

小个子女人倏地在床上坐了起来。尼基的心跳到了嗓子眼上。他竭力使自己保持镇静。

“是我。六点了，我该走了。我不想惊醒你。”

“哦，我忘了。”

她又躺回到枕头上。

“既然你醒了，我就穿上鞋子吧。”

他在床沿上坐下来，穿上了鞋。

“你出去时不要闹出动静。宾馆里的人不喜欢。啊，我太困了。”

“你再睡会儿吧。”

“吻吻我再走。”尼基弯下腰吻了她一下。“你是个好小伙子，完美情人。一路顺风[6]！”

尼基走出了宾馆才感到安全了。此时天已破晓，天空没有一丝云影。海港里，游艇和渔船一动不动地停泊在静静的水面上。码头上，渔民正要开始一天的工作。街道上空无一人。尼基深深地吸了口早上清新的空气，感到头脑清醒，浑身舒坦，不免有些得意。他双肩后仰，大步流星朝小山上走去，然后沿着赌场前面的花园往前走。沾满露珠的鲜花在明亮的晨曦中争奇斗艳，馥郁芬芳，沁人心脾。最后，他回到了自己的旅馆。这时，天已大亮。大厅里，脖子上缠着围巾、头上戴着贝雷帽的搬运工正在忙着打扫卫生。尼基回到自己的房间，洗了个热水澡。他躺在浴缸里，得意扬扬地想到，自己并不像某些人认为的那样是个笨蛋。洗完澡，他活动了下身子，穿上衣服，收拾好行李，然后下楼吃早餐。他胃口相当不错，这是在欧洲大陆吃的最后一顿早饭了。他吃了葡萄柚，喝了粥，享用了熏肉和鸡蛋，用烤箱新烤的面包卷又脆又香，一放到嘴里就化了，此外他还吃了橘子酱，喝了三杯咖啡。饭前就感觉很好，等吃饱喝足了，更是觉得妙不可言。吃罢饭，点上烟斗——尼基最近刚刚学会抽烟——然后，付了账，坐进了等着他的汽车，他们赶往戛纳另一端的机场了。到尼斯之前都是山路，在他之下是蔚蓝色的大海和海岸线。优美的景色令他不由得赞叹起来。他们从尼斯穿城而过，这个黎明中的城市令人感到愉快、友好。很快，他们开上了一条漫长而笔直的滨海公路。尼基付了车费，没用他前天晚上挣的钱，而是用他父亲给的。在尼克博克酒店时，他曾兑换过一张一千法郎的钞票用于支付晚餐费用，但那个小个子女贼把借的一千法郎还给他了，这样他口袋里应该还有两万法郎的纸币。他想把钱拿出来再瞧瞧。钱差点儿没了，价值就等于翻了一番。尼基从屁股口袋里把钱掏出来——为了安全，当时穿衣服时，他把钱塞进了旅行服后面的口袋里。他把钱一张张数过了，突然发现很不对劲：钱应该是二十张才对，现在却有二十六张，真是让人想不通。他又数了两遍，一点儿没错，是两万六，不是两万，真是莫名其妙！他百思不得其解。他心里自问，是不是当时在体育俱乐部赢的钱没数清，不是呀！这个不会出错的，他清楚地记得，兑换处的工作人员把纸币分成四沓放在桌子上，每沓五张，他亲自数过的。突然间，他明白是怎么回事了。当时他一只手拔出富贵菊后，另一只手伸进了花盆，把里面所有的东西全掏出来了。花盆就是那个小贱妇的钱罐啊！他不但把自己的钱拿走了，连她的储蓄也一并取了出来。尼基坐在车里，向后靠了靠，哈哈大笑起来，有生以来从未听说过这等可笑之事。他想到早上那个女人醒来后——当然是在他走后，走到花盆边看昨晚用奇妙的手段弄到的钱，结果发现——钱没了，不仅如此，自己的老本也踪影全无，这时尼基笑得更开心了。就他而言，这事就这样了，他既不知道女人的名字，也不知道女人带他去的那家宾馆的名字，就是想还钱也还不了的。

“恶有恶报。”尼基道。





这就是亨利·加内特在桥牌桌上给朋友们讲的故事。前天晚上吃过晚饭，加内特的妻子和女儿回房休息后，尼基原原本本地讲给他听了。

“你们知道，最让我恼火的是他那副自鸣得意的样子，好像取得了什么大成就。你们不知道他讲完后跟我说的什么。他用天真烂漫的眼神看着我，说，‘你知道，爸爸，我忍不住想，你给我的建议有问题。你说不要赌钱，我赌了，而且赚了大钱；你说不要借给别人钱，我借了，但我如数收回；你还说不要跟女人有来往，你看，我也这么干了，还赚了六千法郎。’”

三个伙伴哄堂大笑起来，但这没让亨利·加内特感到任何轻松。

“你们这些家伙当然可以笑，不过你们不知道，我有多尴尬！这孩子以前很仰慕我、尊敬我，把我的话奉作福音书中的绝对真理。可现在，从他的眼神中，我能看出来，他把我当成了一个废话连篇的老糊涂。我再跟他说什么一燕不成夏是一点儿用也没有了，他不认为自己是靠侥幸一时得手，而觉得全是自己的聪明带来的。这会毁了他的。”

“老伙计，你看起来真的有些傻，”一人说道，“谁能否认这个？没有吧？”

“我知道我傻，但这事让我不开心。太他妈不公平了！命运没权利开这样的玩笑。不管怎样，你得承认，我的建议是好的。”

“是很好。”

“这个孩子让我头疼，他应该吃些苦头，但他没有。你们都是见多识广的人，告诉我这个情况下我该怎么办。”

谁也说不出个办法来。

“唉，亨利，假如我是你的话，我就不会担心，”律师说道，“我相信，你儿子是天生幸运的人，从长远看，这比天生聪明或富贵都要好。”

芒特拉戈勋爵


叶雷　译





奥德林大夫看看桌上的钟：五点四十分。他的病人竟然迟到了，真是令人惊讶，因为芒特拉戈勋爵向来为自己的守时而自豪。芒特拉戈勋爵好为人师，不论说点儿什么，总是煞有介事的，说出来的话一律带着格言的意味。他说惯了什么准时是对智者的赞美，对蠢材的谴责。芒特拉戈勋爵原来约的是五点半。

奥德林大夫长得乏善可陈，又高又瘦，削肩膀，有点儿驼背，灰白的头发稀稀落落，蜡黄色的长脸上爬满了皱纹。他不到五十岁，看起来却要老得多。一双淡蓝色的大眼睛总是昏昏欲睡，你要是跟他待上一会儿，就会发现这双眼睛几乎一动不动，只是一直死死地盯住你的脸，但尽管它们如此空洞无物，也不会令人难受。它们几乎从不闪烁，永不泄露他思想上的蛛丝马迹，而且无论他说什么，它们都我行我素地一成不变。要是你仔细观察他，就会惊讶地发现他连眨眼的次数都比常人少得多。他的手相当大，手指又细又长。这双手柔软却坚定，冰冷却干爽。假如不专门仔细看，你永远说不清楚奥德林大夫穿的是什么。他总是穿深色的衣裳，戴黑领带，这种穿着越发显得他那皱巴巴的黄脸没有血色，那空洞的双眼死滞无神。他总是一副病恹恹的样子。

奥德林大夫是一个心理治疗师。他误打误撞地入了行，每次给人看病都提心吊胆的。大战爆发时，他刚取得行医资格，正在各家医院实习。他主动申请为国效力，不久被派往法国。正是在那个时候，他发现了自己罕见的天赋。他用他那双冰凉而坚定的双手轻抚病人，就能减轻他们的痛苦。他和病人谈话，也常常能帮助备受失眠之苦的人顿生睡意。他说话很慢，他的音色普通之极，他不论说什么都是一样的语气，但却轻柔悦耳，使人平静。他告诉病人他们必须休息，无须担心，必须睡觉，接着睡意便会侵入他们筋疲力尽的骨头，就像在人满为患的长凳上挤出一个位置一般，安宁会把他们的焦虑挤走，睡意会降临到他们疲倦的眼睑上，仿佛绵绵春雨落在新土上一般。奥德林大夫发现，他用低沉单调的声音和病人说话，用空洞无神的眼睛凝视病人，或者用修长坚定的手指轻抚他们的额头，就可以舒缓病人的不安情绪，浇灭令病人坐卧难安的心火，并驱散日夜折磨他们的恐惧。有时他的治疗效果堪称神奇。有一个人在轰炸中被埋进土里，成了哑巴，他成功帮助这个人重新开口说话；另一个人因飞机失事不幸瘫痪，在他的帮助下，病人的四肢恢复了知觉。他无法理解自己的力量，并对这一转变秉持怀疑态度，尽管人们都说，遇到这种情况首先要自信，但他永远做不到。只是，就连最疑神疑鬼的目击者都认为他的行为有神奇的疗效，他只好承认自己有某种神秘的能力，说不清道不明，使他做出连自己也无法解释的事情来。战争结束后，他去维也纳进修，又去了苏黎世，最后在伦敦安顿下来，凭借这些莫名其妙得来的技巧行医糊口。不觉已经过了十五年，他在业内名声大震，关于他的奇闻逸事在坊间盛传。尽管他收费不菲，病人却多得看不过来。奥德林大夫自知取得了不少非凡的成就。他挽救过许多濒临自杀的人，治好了许多精神病患者，帮助生不如死的人摆脱痛苦，彻底扭转了不幸的婚姻。他消灭了丑恶的本性，把很多人从怨恨中释放了出来，让病人的精神恢复了健康。然而，尽管成果卓著，内心深处他一直怀疑自己不过是个江湖医生。

运用连自己都不能理解的力量行医，在他是一件违心之事。他是个诚实的人，连他自己都不相信自己，却叫病人相信他，这实在有违他的诚信。他已经家财万贯，不需要再工作了，而且工作也令他筋疲力尽，他已经无数次萌生过退意。他熟读弗洛伊德和荣格[1]以及其他心理学家的著作，但一直心怀不满，他确信他们所有的理论都是故弄玄虚，尽管治疗效果出人意料的好。十五年间，病人前赴后继地来到他在温坡街[2]上的昏暗房间，他还有什么丑恶的人性没有见识过？人们告诉他不可告人的秘密，有时迫不及待，有时羞羞答答，有时欲言又止，有时怒不可遏，他早就安之若素了，再没有什么能使他惊讶激动了。他现在知道了，人都是骗子，爱慕虚荣，他所知道的关于他们的事远比这些糟糕多了，但他也知道自己没有权利去评判或者声讨他们。只是，年复一年，随着这些可怕的秘密不断地传入他的耳朵，他的脸色变得越来越灰暗，皱纹也越来越深，本就空洞的双眼也越来越疲倦。他几乎忘记了怎么笑，除非偶尔为了放松去读小说的时候。那些作者真的会认为笔下的男男女女是真实的吗？如果他们知道了真实的人要复杂得多，复杂到难以想象的程度，他们灵魂中的各种元素将会如何你死我活地争斗，而这些将他们折磨得生不如死的斗争又是多么的阴暗和丑恶啊！

已经五点四十五分了。奥德林大夫诊治过许多病人，但在他的记忆中，没有哪个病人比芒特拉戈勋爵更奇怪。首先，这个病人的身份非常特殊。芒特拉戈勋爵能力过人，出身高贵，不到四十岁就被任命为外交大臣，他如今任职三年，已经制定出高明的政策，令人叹服，成为保守党中公认的最佳政治家。可惜他的父亲是贵族，一旦去世，他就不能继续在下议院中占有席位，这也使他失去了竞逐首相的资格。不过，即便是在民主时代的英国，首相也不可能来自上议院，只要保守党可以连续执政，芒特拉戈勋爵就能稳坐外交大臣之位，长久地掌控祖国的外交政策。

芒特拉戈勋爵有许多优点。他聪明勤奋，广为游历，能娴熟地驾驭好几门语言。从青少年时期开始，他就专门从事外交事务，切实了解其他国家的政治和经济情况。他敏锐果敢，擅长在公共场所和国会演讲，头脑清晰，一丝不苟，还时常妙语连珠。他是一个才华横溢的辩手，他巧辩的天赋为人称道。他生得一表人才，高大英俊。虽然头秃得厉害了些，也多少有点儿胖，却令他看上去更加稳重老成，这反而成了优势。年轻的时候，他也算是个运动员，参加过牛津的划艇赛，也是英格兰众所周知的优秀射击手。二十四岁时娶了一位十八岁的妻子，岳父是位公爵，岳母是某位美国富豪的继承人。这位既富有又高贵的夫人给他生了两个儿子。两人已经分居多年，但为了保全面子，在公众场合总是出双入对，况且双方都没有外遇，别人也没法说他们闲话。芒特拉戈勋爵实在是太过雄心勃勃，太过勤奋，加之太过爱国，一心扑在事业上，简直不可能受到声色犬马的诱惑。总的来说，他有很多过人之处，因此备受爱戴，功成名就。不幸的是，他的缺点也很显著。

他势利得出奇。如果这个爵位是他父亲挣来的，他这么势利倒实属正常。假如一个律师、制造商或者酿酒师获封为贵族，他的儿子过分地珍重自己的身份地位完全无可厚非。但芒特拉戈勋爵父亲的伯爵爵位是查理二世[3]授予的，他们祖上受封男爵更可远溯至玫瑰战争[4]时期。三百年来，该爵位的继承者不断和英国最显贵的家族联姻。但芒特拉戈勋爵却像暴发户喜欢炫耀家财一般，从不放过任何机会向别人炫耀自己的身份地位。他的举止雍容高贵，但只有对他认为与自己平起平坐的人如此。在社会地位不如他的人面前，他冷漠粗暴。下人被他呼来喝去，秘书也动辄受辱，在他连任的政府部门任职的下属官员对他又怕又恨。他傲慢得吓人。他不得不与形形色色的人接触，他知道他们中的大部分人都不及他聪明，他也从不在他们面前掩饰这一事实。人性的缺陷总是令他不耐烦。他觉得对别人指手画脚是他天生的权利，如果有人请他听取意见，或者要求他解释为何做此决定，无异于引火烧身。他自私到无法形容。别人替他做事，他总觉得理所应当，因为他身居高位，并且才华出众，但他从未想过自己也应该为别人做事。他树敌众多，但没有一个是他瞧得起的，在他眼里没有人值得他费心帮助或者怜悯同情。没有人愿意和他做朋友。长官不信任他，因为他们怀疑他不忠；党内其他成员也不喜欢他，因为他目中无人，横行霸道。然而他太卓尔不群，太爱国，太聪明，把外交事务打理得太出色，他们不得不忍受他的种种不如意之处。他们之所以还忍得下去，也是因为他有时十分招人喜欢。遇到他认为与自己平等的人或是想要结交的人时，陪同外国权贵或名媛淑女时，他会变得欢快、机智和温文尔雅，举手投足间都带着切斯特菲尔德勋爵[5]的影子。他会讲精彩的故事，他能够表现得自然而然，通情达理，甚至知识渊博。你会惊讶于他的无所不知，情趣高雅，和非同凡响。你会觉得他是世界上最好的同伴，你会忘了他昨天才侮辱过你，并且很可能明天又要对你视而不见。

芒特拉戈勋爵差点儿与奥德林大夫失之交臂。有个秘书打电话给奥德林大夫，说他的爵爷想向他咨询，劳烦他第二天早上十点钟到官邸走一趟。奥德林大夫说他去不了，但很乐意与爵爷预约后天五点钟在咨询室见面。秘书记下来，过了一会儿回复说芒特拉戈勋爵坚持在自家官邸会见奥德林大夫，随便大夫收多少钱。奥德林大夫说他只在自己的咨询室会见病人，并表示抱歉，如果芒特拉戈勋爵不准备来见他，他恐怕不能替爵爷排忧解难。一刻钟后，一封便笺送到他手里，说爵爷将于明天五点钟过来，而不是后天。

芒特拉戈勋爵按时赴约，但他没有进门，而是站在门边不可一世地上下打量奥德林大夫。奥德林大夫认为，爵爷肯定已经怒火中烧。他盯着爵爷不说话。这个肥胖沉重的男人像个小巨人，头发开始发灰，向后平梳着，把眉毛衬得很高贵。圆鼓鼓的脸配上端正突出的五官，加之一副桀骜不驯的表情，乍一看倒也有几分十八世纪波旁王室成员的神气。

“看来见你比见首相还难啊，奥德林大夫。我可是个日理万机的人。”

“你不坐下吗？”大夫说。

他面不改色，仿佛芒特拉戈勋爵的话只是耳旁风。奥德林大夫坐在桌子旁的椅子上，芒特拉戈勋爵仍然站着，本来就阴霾满布的眉头蹙得更深了。

“我想我应该告诉你我是外交大臣。”爵爷严厉地说。

“你不坐下吗？”大夫重复道。

芒特拉戈勋爵晃了晃身子，仿佛要立刻转身大步流星地走出咨询室，但他显然仔细想了想这是否是他的本意，于是便坐下了。奥德林大夫展开一本巨大的笔记本，拿起笔，头也不抬地写起来。

“年龄？”

“四十二。”

“结婚了吗？”

“结了。”

“结婚多久了？”

“十八年。”

“有孩子了吗？”

“有两个儿子。”

芒特拉戈勋爵一边粗声粗气地回答问题，奥德林大夫一边把答案记下来，然后他斜靠在椅背上看着爵爷。他没有说话，只是用空洞呆滞的眼睛严肃地看着病人。

“你来找我所为何事？”他终于问道。

“我听说过你。我知道你给嘉纽女士看过病，她说效果还不错。”

奥德林大夫没有回答，依然死死地盯着对方的脸。但这双眼睛毫无表情，仿佛根本看不见爵爷。

“我可不是什么神医。”他终于说，没有一丝笑容，但眼底闪过淡淡的笑意，“就算我做了什么神奇的事情，伦敦皇家内科医学院也不会给我颁发证书。”

芒特拉戈勋爵忍不住笑了一声。看来那缓解了他的敌意，他的口气柔软了些。

“你可是名声在外，看得出来人们很信任你。”

“你来找我所为何事？”

现在轮到芒特拉戈勋爵不说话了，一副难以启齿的模样。奥德林大夫等待着。最后芒特拉戈勋爵终于鼓足勇气开了口。

“我健康得不得了。几天前，我让我的私人医生帮我做了次体检，就是奥古斯塔斯·菲茨赫伯特爵士，你肯定听说过他。他说我像三十岁的年轻人一样壮实。我对国家可谓鞠躬尽瘁，但乐此不疲，工作对我而言是一种享受。我不怎么抽烟，喝酒也很节制，经常运动，生活规律。我健康极了，一点儿毛病也没有。我想你现在肯定会把我看成恶作剧的蠢小孩。”

奥德林大夫知道自己必须帮助他。

“我不知道可以为你做什么，但我会尽力而为。你有感到痛苦不堪吗？”

芒特拉戈勋爵蹙起眉头。

“我可是个举足轻重的人物，我奉命做出的决定不仅直接影响国家利益，还关系到世界和平。我的判断必须公平，我的头脑必须保持清醒，这绝对必要。我严于律己，坚决不让任何可能引致烦恼的事情影响到我的工作表现。”

奥德林大夫一直盯着他，看出不少问题。在他的病人虚浮的架子和傲慢的自负背后，潜藏着无法驱散的焦虑。

“我之所以请你上门，是因为这么多年的经验告诉我，相比熟悉的环境，人在肮脏的咨询室里更容易向医生推心置腹。”

“这里确实够脏的。”芒特拉戈勋爵刻薄地说，然后停了下来。这个人向来充满自信，思维敏捷，雷厉风行，这一刻他却忐忑不安，张皇失措。他勉强挤出笑容，好让医生认为自己毫不紧张，但他的眼睛却出卖了他烦乱的心情。当他再度开口时，表现出一种不自然的诚实。

“为了这么微不足道的事情来麻烦你，我真有点儿不好意思。恐怕你只会说我是个笨蛋，简直是在浪费你的时间。”

“再微不足道的事情也可能很重要，可能是深度神经错乱的表现。别担心浪费我的时间。”

奥德林先生的声音低沉严肃，平缓的语调有一种奇异的抚慰作用。芒特拉戈勋爵终于下定决心把心里话说出来。

“是这样的，我近来一直在做一些很无聊的梦。我也知道拿它们当回事真的很蠢，但——好吧，事实上，恐怕正是它们把我折磨得心神不宁。”

“可以描述一下吗？”

芒特拉戈勋爵不好意思地笑了，他试着笑得轻松一些，却越发显得苦涩。

“它们简直愚蠢至极，我实在有些难以启齿。”

“没关系。”

“好吧。第一个梦是从大概一个月之前开始的。我梦见自己去康纳马拉大宅参加宴会。那是一个官方宴会，国王和王后将应邀驾临，我当然要盛装出席，我佩戴着勋带和星形勋章。我走进衣帽间，让仆人帮我脱掉大衣。有个小个子男人也在那里，他叫欧文·格里菲思，是威尔士的小议员。实话告诉你，我见到他非常惊讶。他地位低微，我自言自语地说，‘真是的，莉迪亚·康纳马拉也太离谱了，说不定下次连乞丐也会请过来。’我想他一定在非常好奇地望着我，但我没有理他。事实上，我装作没看见他，径直走上楼梯。我猜你从来没去过那里吧？”

“没有。”

“这就对了，那不是你会去的地方。那座房子俗不可耐，但有一条非常漂亮的大理石楼梯，康纳马拉夫妇在楼梯上面接待客人。我和康纳马拉夫人握手时，她惊讶地看着我，忍不住咯咯地笑起来。我没有太在意，她总是很蠢，没有教养，举止风度比起她那受封于查理二世的祖先好不了多少。我不得不承认，康纳马拉大宅的会客室还算体面。我一直往里走，向很多人点头示意，和他们握手，后来看见德国大使和一个奥地利大公[6]相谈甚欢。我正好有事找大公，便上前伸出手。大公一看见我就捧腹大笑起来。他竟敢公然侮辱我，我严厉地上下扫视他，但他笑得更加厉害。我正准备反唇相讥时，会客室突然肃静下来，我想一定是国王和王后驾到了。我转身背向大公，朝前走去，然后，突然之间，我发现自己没穿长裤，露着丝织内裤，还有猩红色的吊带袜！难怪康纳马拉夫人窃笑，也难怪大公狂笑！我无法告诉你那一刻究竟意味着什么。简直丢脸丢到家了。我惊醒了，一身冷汗。噢，你不知道当我发现它仅仅是梦时有多欣慰。”

“这个梦也算不上很离奇。”奥德林大夫说。

“我也是这样想。但第二天发生了一件奇怪的事。我走在下议院的走廊里，那个格里菲思慢条斯理地从我身边经过。他故意看看我的腿，又直直看着我的脸，我敢肯定他在那里挤眉弄眼。尽管很荒唐，但我突然觉得，前一天晚上，他确实在我的梦里，看到我在人前出洋相，并在一旁窃喜。不过我也知道那是不可能的，那只是梦罢了。我冷冷地斜了他一眼，他便继续往前走了，但笑得摇头晃脑的。”

芒特拉戈勋爵从口袋里掏出手帕擦干手心。现在他不再挣扎着要掩饰自己内心的不安，奥德林大夫的眼睛一刻也没有离开他。

“把另一个梦告诉我。”

“第二晚的梦更荒诞了。我梦见自己在下议院里参加一场关于外交事务的辩论，这场辩论不仅备受全国上下关注，甚至堪称举世瞩目。政府决定调整一项与帝国命运息息相关的政策，那可是个历史性的场合。下议院当然是座无虚席，所有的大使都在场，连过道也被挤得水泄不通。我当晚负责发表一篇重要的演讲，讲稿准备得非常仔细。像我这样的人自然有许多敌人，不少人对我年纪轻轻便身居高位心怀怨妒，要知道很多聪明绝顶的人在我这个岁数能当个小官员就已经心满意足了。我决心不仅要让这次演讲流芳百世，同时还要通过它来使那些诋毁我的人无话可说。想到自己所说的一字一句都牵动着世界的命脉，实在是激动不已。我站起身。如果你在下议院开过会，就知道在辩论的时候议员们会不断地交头接耳，沙沙地查阅文件，把报告翻来翻去，然而我一开口，全场立刻安静下来。我忽然看到那个面目可憎的威尔士议员格里菲思就坐在对面一张长凳上向我吐舌头。不知道你有没有听过一首粗俗的舞厅流行曲，叫作《双人自行车》，很多年前曾红极一时。为了向格里菲思表示我有多么瞧不起他，我开始唱这首歌。第一段唱得非常好，面向讲台的听众们惊讶得一时语塞，唱完后，他们高喊‘继续！继续！’我举手示意他们安静下来，接着唱第二段。所有人一声不吭地听我唱下去，我察觉到自己越唱越难听，感到很气恼，我的男中音可是十分优美动人的。我决心要挽回面子，但当我唱第三段的时候，有人开始笑，笑声一发不可收拾，各国大使，贵宾席上的权贵，女宾席上的贵妇，记者，全部笑得前俯后仰，笑声响彻云霄，有人笑得歪到一旁，有人在座位上打滚。每个人都笑个不停，除了坐在我身后的前座议员席上的大臣们。他们被空前的狂乱吓得目瞪口呆，感到难以置信，坐在那里一动不动。我扫了他们一眼，突然意识到自己闯了大祸。我让自己成了全世界的笑柄，我痛苦地意识到这下想不辞职都不行了。我惊醒了，知道这只是一个梦。”

讲述这个梦的时候，芒特拉戈勋爵完全顾不上保持优雅的举止风度。等到终于说完，他已脸如死灰，浑身乱颤。但他努力振作起来，勉强用颤抖的嘴唇笑道：

“这个梦真是太天马行空了，连我都忍俊不禁。我没再多想。第二天下午，当我走进下议院时自觉状态良好。那天下午的辩论很无趣，但我必须在场，于是我就翻起一些需要我审阅的文件来。忘记是因为什么事情了，我偶然抬起头来，发现格里菲思正在发言。他的威尔士口音真是难听，外表也邋里邋遢，令人反感。我简直无法想象他能说出值得我花时间去听的话，便打算低头继续看文件，他却忽然引用了两句《双人自行车》里的歌词。我忍不住斜了他一眼，他正盯着我，嘲讽地笑着。我微微耸耸肩。一个地位低微的威尔士小议员竟敢那样看着我，真是不知天高地厚。他引用了那首歌的歌词，那首我在梦里唱了一整晚的歌，难道仅仅是一个巧合吗？真是奇怪。我又继续开始看文件，但坦白说，我根本无法集中精神。我感到有些蹊跷。欧文·格里菲思闯入了我的第一个梦，在康纳马拉大宅的那个，过后给了我一个非常强烈的印象，他肯定看到了我的窘相。他刚才引用那两句歌词真的只是一个巧合吗？我不禁问自己，他是否也梦见了我的梦？不过当然这纯属异想天开，我决心不再大惊小怪。”

两人都不说话。奥德林大夫看着芒特拉戈勋爵，芒特拉戈勋爵也看着奥德林大夫。

“其他人的梦总是非常无聊。我太太偶尔做一个梦，第二天就非要告诉我她梦见了什么不可，还要把每一个细节都认认真真地描述出来，真是烦死人。”

奥德林大夫微微一笑。

“你做的梦还挺有趣的。”

“我再告诉你几天后我做的一个梦吧。我梦见自己走进莱姆豪斯区[7]的一间小酒吧。我从未去过莱姆豪斯区，而且入读牛津大学之后就再也没有去过酒吧，但我看着我走进的那条街和那间酒吧就像我是正身处家中一般。我走进一个房间，我不知道他们是否称它为沙龙吧或是私人吧，那儿有一个火炉和一张大大的皮面扶手椅，另一边则摆着一张小沙发，吧台占了一整面墙，望出去就是公共区。临门是一张圆形大理石桌面的桌子，旁边放着两张扶手椅。那是周六晚上，酒吧里人山人海。灯大亮着，但许多人在抽烟，熏得我眼睛疼。我打扮得像个流氓，戴着帽子，脖子上围着丝巾。我觉得那里的人都喝醉了，有趣得很。留声机正播着唱片，也可能是无线电的声音，我也分不清楚。火炉前有两个女人在跳着古怪的舞，她们身边围了一小群人，笑着，欢呼着，唱着歌。我起身过去凑热闹，有人冲我说，‘来杯酒吧，比尔！’桌子上放着装满黑色液体的玻璃杯，我知道它叫作棕色艾尔酒。他递给我一杯，我不想惹人怀疑就喝了下去。正在跳舞的其中一个女人撇下同伴，从我手里夺过杯子。‘你这是想怎么着？’她说，‘你喝的是我的酒。’‘啊，真对不起，’我说，‘这位先生叫我喝，我还以为是他请客呢。’‘好吧，伙计，’她说，‘没关系。来和我跳支舞吧！’我还来不及拒绝，她已经一把拉住我跳起舞来。然后我发现自己坐在了扶手椅上，她就坐在我大腿上，我们喝着同一杯啤酒。我必须说，对我来说夫妻生活从来不是什么要紧的事情。我之所以这么早结婚，是身份与地位所需，同时也是为了一次性彻底解决性的问题。我决心要有两个儿子，达成任务后就把男女之事抛开了。我忙得不可开交，哪里有时间想这类事，况且我又是个公众人物，传出桃色新闻无异于自毁前程。政治家最有价值的资本就是与女人毫无瓜葛。对于那些事业被女人搞得一塌糊涂的男人，我最不耐烦了，我鄙视他们。我大腿上的女人喝得醉醺醺的，既不漂亮也不年轻，事实上，她只是个黑乎乎的老妓女。她令我恶心之极，但当她把嘴凑上来亲我时，尽管她满嘴酒臭，一口烂牙，尽管我也恨自己不争气，但我想要她——不顾一切地想要她。突然我听到一个声音，‘那就对了，老友，好好享受吧。’我抬起头来，是欧文·格里菲思。我差点儿跳了起来，但那个可怕的女人压着我。‘别理他，’她说，‘他总是闲得慌。’‘别磨蹭了，’他说，‘茉儿可好了，她不会让你白花钱的。’在那种荒唐的情境下碰到他已经够糟糕的了，他居然还叫我‘老友’。我把那个女人推开，站起来凶恶地面向着他。‘我不认识你，也不想认识你。’我说。‘我可认识你。’他说，‘茉儿，你可要看紧了，他经常赖账，别让他跑了。’旁边的桌子上有一瓶酒，我二话不说，抓起瓶脖子，用尽全身力气从他头上敲下去，一下子把自己惊醒了。”

“那样的梦也不是不可理解，”奥德林大夫说，“只是复仇的天性在品德高尚的人身上闪现出来罢了。”

“这个梦本身不值一提，太荒唐了，关键是第二天发生的事情。我急于查点儿资料，便走进议会图书馆，找到那本书翻起来。我随便找了个座位坐下，没想到格里菲思就坐在我旁边。另一个工党议员走进来，踱到他身旁。‘你好，欧文，’那个工党议员对他说，‘你气色不太好。’‘我头疼得厉害，’他回答说，‘就跟被酒瓶子砸到脑袋似的。’”

这会儿，芒特拉戈勋爵痛苦得面如死灰。

“那一刻，我确信之前被我抛弃的想法并不荒谬。格里菲思和我做着一样的梦，并且与我一样记得清清楚楚。”

“那可能也只是个巧合。”

“他那句话不是对朋友说的，而是故意说给我听的。他看着我，一脸怨毒。”

“为什么这个人总是出现在你的梦中？你对此有什么想法吗？”

“毫无头绪。”

奥德林大夫的目光从未从病人脸上移开，他看出来爵爷撒谎了。他用铅笔在吸墨纸上胡乱画了一两根曲线。要让病人坦白往往需要花费很长时间，纵然他们也知道如果不说实话，大夫就无法提供帮助。

“你刚刚向我描述的这些梦是三周多前做的。那之后你还做过吗？”

“每晚都做。”

“每晚都能梦见格里菲思？”

“是的。”

大夫在吸墨纸上画了更多的线条。这间小屋死一般的寂静，沉闷得令人发慌，光线昏暗，他希望这种氛围能让芒特拉戈勋爵变得敏感起来。芒特拉戈勋爵一甩身靠在椅背上，别过头去，躲开了对方严肃的目光。

“奥德林大夫，请你一定帮帮我。我已经撑不下去了，再这样下去我一定会发疯。我不敢上床睡觉，已经熬了好几晚。我坐着读书，困了就披上大衣出去走，直到精疲力竭。但我不得不睡觉，我有这么多事情要处理，我必须时刻处于最佳状态，充分调动各方面的能力。我需要休息，但越睡越累。我一睡着就开始做梦，总是梦见他，那个下流的无赖，对我露齿而笑，他讥讽我，鄙视我。我受不了这种虐待。真的，大夫，我不是梦里的那个我，用这些梦来判断我的为人是不公正的。不管你问谁，他都会说我是正直诚实的正派人，在公在私我都光明磊落，没有人可以对我的人品横加指责。我一心只是想为国效力，保住祖国的荣耀地位。我有钱，有地位，我不像地位低微的人那样，如此容易就向诱惑屈服，我也不需要别人说我清正廉洁。但我可以发誓，荣誉也好，特权也好，私利也好，没有什么能让我做出对不起这个职位的事情。我牺牲了一切才换来今天的成就，我要的是名垂千古，这个愿望马上要实现了，我却开始畏缩。我并不是梦里那个卑鄙、懦弱、下流的生物，那个可怕的无赖看到的都是假象。我告诉你的那三个梦简直不值一提，但我在梦里的所作所为是如此野蛮，如此恐怖，如此可耻，就算死我也不想说出来。但他全都看见了，他记得一清二楚。我简直不能面对他那嘲讽和厌恶的目光，我甚至不敢跟他说话，我知道他只会把我的话当成骗人的鬼话。他亲眼看见我做出了任何有自尊的人都不会做的事。不论谁做了这样的事，都会众叛亲离，锒铛入狱。他还听到我说的下流话，在他眼中，我不知所谓、令人作呕。他鄙视我，而且马上就要把我的丑态公之于众。真的，如果你不帮我想想办法，我只能自杀，或者杀死他。”

“换作是我就不会杀他，”奥德林大夫淡淡地说，依然是舒缓的声音，“在这个国家，杀害同胞可是滔天大罪。”

“你是说我要为此偿命？我不会因此而上绞刑台的。谁会知道我是凶手？那个梦让我知道应该怎么做。真的，我用酒瓶砸他的头后，他第二天头疼欲裂，看不清楚东西，那是他自己说的。那表明他在睡梦中的遭遇会影响到醒来后的他。下次我不用酒瓶砸他。等下次做梦的时候，我要拿着一把刀，或者在口袋里装一支枪，我一定能做到的，因为我一心要杀死他！我要抓住机会，像刺死一头猪一样刺死他，像射死一条狗一样射死他。我要射穿他的心脏，摆脱他那惨无人道的虐待。”

也许有人会觉得芒特拉戈勋爵疯了。然而，奥德林大夫行医这么多年，专职医治生了病的人类灵魂，他知道被我们称作正常与失常的人之间可能并没有那么明显的区别。他知道，有很多人在我们眼中正常健康，安分守己，不存非分之想，不仅能把自己照顾得妥妥帖帖，还能惠及旁人。但当你获得他们的信任，撕掉他们在世人面前戴着的面具后，却常常会发现他们不仅反常得变态，还有许多奇怪的念头，难填的欲壑，从这些方面来看，他们完全可以被称为精神病人。不要幻想把这些人全部关进疯人院，世界上根本没有那么多疯人院。无论如何，即使一个人做了奇怪的梦，并因此而变得神经兮兮，也未必就可以被诊断为患有精神病。这个病例很特殊，但也只不过是比奥德林大夫的其他病人严重一些而已。然而，奥德林大夫很有点儿怀疑，他惯用的有效治疗方法能不能治好这位爵爷的病。

“你有没有咨询过我的同行？”他问。

“只有奥古斯塔斯爵士。我只是告诉他我在经受噩梦的折磨。他说我操劳过度，建议我去旅游散心。简直胡闹！国际形势紧张得很，我哪里离得开外交部？我知道外交部少了我可不行，况且我要是在这个关键时刻犯错，前途就毁了。他给我开镇静药，我吃了毫无效果，他又给我开补药，我吃了更难受。要他有什么用！”

“为什么总是这个人不断地在你梦中出现？你能想出点儿什么理由来吗？”

“这个问题你已经问过我，我也已经回答过了。”

他说得倒也不错，但奥德林大夫对他的回答并不满意。

“刚刚你提到了虐待。欧文·格里菲思为什么要虐待你？”

“我不知道。”

芒特拉戈勋爵躲开了奥德林大夫的目光。奥德林大夫非常肯定他没有说真话。

“你伤害过他吗？”

“从未。”

芒特拉戈勋爵一动不动，但奥德林大夫有一种奇怪的感觉，觉得他仿佛缩成了一团。眼前这个男人，高大威武，桀骜不驯，好像问他这样的问题无疑是一种傲慢无礼的行为。但在这个外表之下，某些东西隐约泄露出他内心的慌乱和恐惧，让人想起落入陷阱的野兽。奥德林大夫探过身去，用严厉的目光强迫芒特拉戈勋爵与自己对视。

“你肯定？”

“当然肯定。看来你没有弄清楚，我和他是两个世界的人。对此我也懒得解释，但我必须提醒你，我贵为外交大臣，而格里菲思只不过是一个无足挂齿的工党议员，我和他风马牛不相及。他出身低微，而我总是出入于上流场所，基本见不到他。我的政治地位也比他高出太多，根本不可同日而语。”

“如果你不肯坦诚相告，我就无能为力。”

芒特拉戈勋爵扬起眉毛，声音粗哑地说：

“我不习惯别人质疑我的话，奥德林大夫。如果你要这样做，继续留在这里打扰你只是在浪费我的时间。请你告诉我的秘书治疗费用是多少，他会给你寄支票。”

如果只看奥德林大夫脸上的表情，你一定会以为他没有听到芒特拉戈勋爵的话。他继续定定地看着爵爷的眼睛，用严肃而低沉的声音说：“你有做过什么可能令他视为伤害的事情吗？”

芒特拉戈勋爵犹疑了。他的目光转向别处，然后就好像奥德林大夫的目光中隐藏着一种他无法抵挡的压迫性的力量，他只好又把目光转了回来。他闷闷不乐地回答道：“都怪他是个肮脏下流的小无赖。”

“你刚刚就是这么描述他的。”

芒特拉戈勋爵叹了一口气，他被打败了。奥德林大夫知道这声叹息表明他终于要坦白了。奥德林大夫不再逼他，低下头开始在吸墨纸上胡乱画几何图案。沉默持续了好几分钟。

“我说，我什么都跟你说，只要对治疗有帮助。我之前没有提到这件事，是因为我认为它太微不足道了，说出来也没有用。在上一次选举中，格里菲思赢得了一个席位，一上任就兴风作浪，惹人讨厌。他父亲是个矿主，他自己年轻时也在矿上工作，后来成为公立小学的校长，还当过记者。他属于那种似懂非懂、骄傲自负的知识分子，学识不纯，观点片面，制定出来的计划简直是异想天开，他是义务教育产生的怪胎。他骨瘦如柴，面无血色，一副食不果腹的样子，穿得也总是邋里邋遢。尽管现在的议员都不怎么在意自己的衣着，但他穿成这样简直有损议会的尊严。他仿佛还为自己的寒酸相感到光荣，衣领从来不洗干净，领带打得歪歪扭扭，整个人看起来好像一个月没洗澡，双手肮脏不堪。工党有几个前座议员[8]还算有点儿本事，其余的都是无能之辈。在盲人的国度里，独眼人就是国王，因为格里菲思巧舌如簧，对什么都懂得点儿皮毛，一有机会工党的秘书就把他推出去发言。看来他也自以为是个外交专家，不断向我提出愚蠢无聊的问题。坦白说，我决定好好教训他一回，他完全是自作自受。从一开始我就讨厌他说话的方式，带着哭腔，满嘴浓重的口音，粗俗不堪。他总是摆出一副扭扭捏捏的样子，让我尤为恼火。他讲话十分腼腆，迟疑不决，好像叫他说话是在折磨他，但他的内心又仿佛充满热情，不吐不快，常常说出些令人哭笑不得的话来。我不得不说，他偶尔也能慷慨激昂地雄辩一番，对工党议员稀里糊涂的思想影响甚深。他们被他的诚恳真挚打动，但在我看来，他那种多愁善感简直令人作呕。装作多愁善感是政治辩论中的惯用伎俩，每个国家都以自身利益为重，同时又倾向于在外交目标中涂抹上利他的色彩。如果政治家能用花言巧语来说服选民，说自己为了保护国家利益而进行的艰难谈判同时也有利于促进人类的整体幸福，倒也无可指责，但像格里菲思这样的人错就错在把这些花言巧语当了真。他是狂热分子，讨厌的狂热分子。他叫自己理想主义者，张口就是那些学界喋喋不休了许多年的废话，什么不抵抗主义，人类的兄弟之情，简直是垃圾。糟糕的是，他不仅在工党内产生了影响，甚至动摇了我们保守党内一些愚不可及的糊涂成员。有传言说，如果工党上台，格里菲思很可能会身居要职，甚至有人建议由他出任外交大臣。这当然有点儿荒谬，但也不是绝对不可能。一天，格里菲思挑起了一场关于外交事务的辩论，我乘机煽风点火，让大家都参与进来。他说了足足一个小时，我认为这是毁掉他的天赐良机，感谢上帝，先生，我真的把他毁掉了。我痛批他的发言，指出他论证错误，无知无识，我把他贬得一文不值。在下议院中，最要命的武器就是嘲笑，我对他极尽讥讽之能事。我那天状态很好，下议院里的笑声惊天动地，他们笑得越开心，我就越兴奋，越发地滔滔不绝，反对党的成员默默地坐着，垂头丧气，但其中几个成员后来也忍不住笑出了声。被对手讥笑倒还可以忍受，但连同僚也讥笑自己，让他情何以堪。我把格里菲思侮辱得无地自容，我想再没有人能做到这种程度。他坐下，缩成一团，脸色煞白。过了一会儿，他用双手遮住脸。我说完坐下的时候，他已经没有翻身的可能了。我彻底摧毁了他的名声，就算工党上台，他也没有希望任职外交大臣，就如看门的警察一样没有机会。后来，我听说他的父亲，那个老矿主，带着他母亲和许多支持他的选民专门从威尔士北上为他打气，准备为他期望中的胜利喝彩，结果却看到他输得一败涂地。他以极为微弱的优势当选，这样一个打击很容易导致他失去议会的席位，但那不关我的事。”

“要是我说你毁了他的事业，算不算言过其实？”奥德林大夫问。

“我觉得你不会那样说。”

“你给他造成了非常严重的伤害。”

“那是他自找的。”

“你有为此感到过内疚吗？”

“要是我知道他父母也在场，也许会给他一个台阶下。”

奥德林大夫的话已经说完了，开始用他认为有效的方法为病人治疗。他试图通过心理暗示来帮助病人在清醒的时候忘记梦中景象，并试图帮助病人进入深沉的无梦睡眠，但他发现芒特拉戈勋爵的抗性实在无懈可击。过了一个小时，他请病人回去。后来爵爷又来过五六回，但疗效甚微。可怕的梦境继续每晚折磨着这个可怜的人，病人的身体状态每况愈下，他变得面目全非，暴躁到无法自控。芒特拉戈勋爵对于治疗的无效十分不满，但他依然按时求诊，因为与大夫见面不仅是唯一一线生机，而且大夫也是唯一一个可以听他畅所欲言的人，把烦恼说出来总算是一种释放。最终，奥德林大夫得出结论，只有一个办法可以让他得到解脱，但他太了解他了，依他的性子，绝对不肯这样做。芒特拉戈勋爵已经处于崩溃的边缘，如果要救他，一定要诱使他放下天生的骄傲和顽固的自负，尽管这对他而言是个很大的挑战。不能再拖了。大夫一直使用心理暗示的方式进行治疗，效果越来越明显。最后，他终于变得睡意蒙眬。大夫的声音低沉、柔软、单调，舒缓着他备受折磨的神经。大夫不断重复相同的话，芒特拉戈勋爵非常安静地躺着，闭着眼，呼吸规律，四肢放松。然后奥德林大夫继续用那种安静的语气把准备好的话说了出来。

“你要去找欧文·格里菲思，说你为给他造成如此巨大的伤害感到非常抱歉。你跟他说你要运用手中的权力，不惜一切地弥补这个伤害。”

这些话好像鞭子一样抽向芒特拉戈勋爵的脸，他一下子醒了，跳起来。他的眼睛燃烧着熊熊怒火，他失去理智一般随口谩骂大夫，骂出了许多连他自己都没听过的污言秽语。他诋毁大夫，诅咒大夫，奥德林大夫什么难听的话没有听过？他甚至还听过优雅高贵的太太骂粗口，但此刻也对他的话大为震惊。

“要我向那个下贱的威尔士人道歉？我还不如去自杀。”

“我相信那是唯一让你恢复正常的办法。”

爵爷还没有到精神失常的地步，竟然如此失控，这种情况在奥德林大夫的病人中也不多见。爵爷的脸红得像烧熟了一般，双眼暴突，嘴角的白沫清晰可见。奥德林大夫冷静地看着他，等待这场风暴自行平息。目前来看，连日来的紧张状态已让芒特拉戈勋爵日渐憔悴，他已经精疲力竭了。

“坐下。”大夫厉声说。

芒特拉戈勋爵蜷缩到椅子里。

“天啊，我快不行了。让我缓一分钟，然后我就走。”

他们一声不吭，寂静持续了大约五分钟。芒特拉戈勋爵是一个粗野横蛮的恶霸，但也是一位绅士。当他恢复镇定时，便主动打破了沉默。

“我恐怕刚才太过失礼了，对你说了那样的话，对此我感到十分羞愧。即使你拒绝继续帮我治疗，我也不会怪你。但我希望你不要放弃我，我觉得这几次治疗确实对我有帮助，我想你是我的唯一机会。”

“别再想你说过的话了，没关系的。”

“但只有一件事你不能要求我做，那就是叫我去向格里菲思道歉。”

“我在你身上费了不少心思。我不想假装已经很理解你，但我想只有按我的建议去做，你才能获得解脱。我认为，我们每个人都不仅仅拥有一个自我，而是有很多个。你的其中一个自我站了出来，抗议你对格里菲思造成的伤害，在你的脑海中变成了格里菲思的形象，代他惩罚你的恶行。如果我是牧师，就会说是你的良心变成了他的样子，呵斥你痛改前非，劝喻你诚心赎罪。”

“我并没有感到良心不安。我确实毁了他的前途，但那不是我的错。这么做跟踩死花园里的一条蛞蝓没什么区别，没什么值得后悔的。”

芒特拉戈勋爵说完这句话就离开了。奥德林大夫一边等着他来，一边把笔记从头到尾翻了一遍，思考着在各种常规疗法都已经失效之后，该如何说服他接受这个唯一可行的办法。大夫看了一眼钟，六点。芒特拉戈勋爵竟然没有来。大夫知道他原本打算来的，因为秘书早上打电话来说他会在老时间前去拜访。肯定有什么紧急事务把他给耽误了。这么一想，大夫又醒悟到另一个问题：芒特拉戈勋爵已经非常不适合继续坚持工作，他的状态也不适合处理重要的国家事务。大夫想，也许应该联系某个当权人物、首相或者外交部常务秘书，告诉他们芒特拉戈勋爵的精神状态非常不稳定，继续把国家要务交由他处理是很危险的。那相当棘手，很可能招致不必要的麻烦，费力不讨好。他耸耸肩。

“反正，”他想，“在过去二十五年间，政治家已经把世界弄得如此乌烟瘴气，也许不管他们是正常人还是疯子，结果都是一样的吧。”

他拉响铃。

“如果芒特拉戈勋爵来了，请告诉他我六点一刻还有预约，恐怕不能见他。”

“好的，先生。”

“晚报送来了吗？”

“我去看看。”

过了一会儿，仆人把晚报拿进来。一个巨大的标题横在头版上：外交大臣不幸辞世。

“天啊！”奥德林大夫大喊。

这一次，他再也无法保持镇静。他大吃一惊，心中充满恐惧，但一点儿也不觉得意外。他多次想到过芒特拉戈勋爵很有可能看不开，所以这次肯定是自杀，他毫不怀疑。报上说事发时芒特拉戈勋爵在地铁站等车，站在站台的边缘，火车进站时，有人看到他掉下铁轨，可能是突发昏厥。报道又说，芒特拉戈勋爵已经连续好几周超负荷工作，然而外国局势需要他密切注视，他只好坚守工作岗位。现代的杰出政治人物总是备受压力摧残，芒特拉戈勋爵是又一位受害者。还有一篇小短文赞颂已故的芒特拉戈勋爵才华横溢、勤奋努力、高瞻远瞩，接着是外交大臣后继者的各种猜测。奥德林大夫全部都读了。他从来没有喜欢过芒特拉戈勋爵，这个惨案之所以令他情绪激动，主要是因为他觉得自己没能帮上忙。

也许他应该和芒特拉戈勋爵的私人医生联系一下。他很泄气。他总是尽心尽力地治疗病人，一旦失败了，就会非常受挫，对那套赖以为生的江湖医术产生极端的反感。他的对手是各种黑暗神秘的力量，超出了人类头脑的理解范围。他像蒙着眼睛摸索道路的人，不知道会走去哪里。他无精打采地翻着报纸，突然吓了一大跳，差点儿又大喊出来。某个栏目底部有一篇小报道：国会议员猝然离世。欧文·格里菲思先生，某党成员，当天下午在舰队街[9]突发疾病，被送到查令十字医院时已经去世了。他的死看来是由自然原因引致的，但稍后会验尸。奥德林大夫几乎无法相信自己的眼睛。难道前一天晚上芒特拉戈勋爵终于在梦中如愿发现自己手持武器，刀或枪，并杀死了折磨他的人？跟上次用酒瓶砸欧文，令欧文次日头痛欲裂一样，这桩梦中的谋杀案是否也在次日产生了效果？又或者，更为神秘和可怕的是，当芒特拉戈勋爵自杀以求解脱，那个备受他残酷虐待的敌人，怨恨难平，也放弃了自己终将结束的生命，追逐他去到另一个时空，继续折磨他？实在是太离奇了。当然，把这两件事看成一次离奇的巧合更加合乎常理。奥德林大夫摇响铃。

“请告诉米尔顿太太，恐怕今晚我不能见她了，我有点儿不舒服。”

此言不虚。他浑身颤抖，好像得了疟疾一样，一种超自然的触感瞬间流过全身，他仿佛窥见了一个荒凉狰狞的空间。灵魂的黑夜吞噬了他，他感到了难以名状的、奇怪而原始的恐惧。

烈日炙烤着外面的码头。摩托车、卡车、公共汽车、私家车、出租车川流不息地从拥挤的道路上驶过，每个司机都在按喇叭。人力车沿着它们轻巧的路线在人群中穿梭，气喘吁吁的车夫们，声嘶力竭地相互吆喝着。苦力们背着沉重的大包裹，侧着身子，踉踉跄跄地碎步快走着，向路人大声嚷嚷，要他们让路。路边有许多小贩在叫卖各色货物。新加坡是诸多民族交汇之处，在这里能看到肤色各异的人：棕黑色的泰米尔人，黄色的中国佬，赭石色的马来人，亚美尼亚人，犹太人，孟加拉人，他们粗声向对方问好。但里普利、乔伊斯和内勒律师事务所里却清新舒适。它躲在烁玉流金、沙尘滚滚、人声鼎沸的大街后面，独享一方幽静阴凉。乔伊斯先生坐在他个人办公室里的桌子边，一台电扇迎面朝他吹着强风。他斜靠在椅背上，双肘抵着扶手，十指轻巧地尖尖相对。他面朝一个长长的架子，上面是如断烂朝报一般成堆的《判例汇编》，此刻他正看着它们出神。一个橱柜上面放着漆过的方形铁盒，铁盒上用油漆写着各个委托人的姓名。

有人敲门。

“进来。”

一名衣装整洁的华人助理开门进来。

“克罗斯比先生已到，先生。”

他的英语标准流利，每个单词的发音都精确无误，乔伊斯先生总是惊讶于他无边无际的词汇量。王智生是广东人，曾在格雷律师学院[1]修习法律。他意欲在里普利、乔伊斯和内勒律师事务所实习几年，以备将来自立门户。他勤奋，有礼，品行端正。

“请带他进来。”乔伊斯先生道。

他站起来和访客握手，请访客就座。在此过程中，一片光在他身上掠过，然而他的脸仍然藏在阴影中。他生来就是一个沉默的男人。此时，他凝视着罗伯特·克罗斯比，久久不置一词。克罗斯比轩昂魁伟，身高超过六英尺，肩膀宽阔，肌肉结实。他是一位橡胶园主，常常要在种植园里四处走动，每天工作结束后还去打网球放松，锻炼出一身钢筋铁骨。他被晒得乌黑，一双巨手毛茸茸的，一双巨脚穿着又笨又沉的靴子。乔伊斯先生不禁想，他的铁拳真的能够一下打死一个脆弱的泰米尔人。但他碧青的眼睛是温和的，柔软的目光里充满信任。他生得粗枝大叶，却有一张坦率而真诚的脸，但此刻这张脸枯槁憔悴，正笼罩在悲伤的阴霾里。

“看来你这几晚都没怎么合眼。”乔伊斯先生道。

“没错。”

乔伊斯先生注意到克罗斯比先生放在桌上的一顶破双檐帽，又把目光移到他的卡其色短裤上，他发红的大腿长着浓密的毛，网球衫的领子敞开着，没戴领带，卡其色夹克脏兮兮的，袖口捋了起来。他这副模样，仿佛刚刚去橡胶树林流浪了一番。乔伊斯先生不禁双眉微蹙。

“请你振作起来。你必须保持镇静。”

“噢，我好着呢。”

“今天去见你太太了吗？”

“还没，我打算下午去。他们竟然把她抓了起来，真是丧尽天良！”

“他们没有选择。”乔伊斯先生用他特有的柔和嗓音说道。

“我以为他们会让我保释她。”

“这可是一件大案子。”

“得了吧！任何一个正派女人遇到那种情况都会反抗，只是没几个有那份勇气罢了。世上再也没有比莱斯莉更善良的人了，她连一只苍蝇都不忍心拍死。为什么要这样对她！这些人真过分！我和她结婚十二年了，难道还不知道她是什么人？上天作证，要是让我抓到那个男人，一定会拧断他的脖子，毫不犹豫地将他杀死！换做是您，您也一定会这么做。”

“我亲爱的朋友，大家都支持你，没有人会替哈蒙德说话。我们会帮她洗脱嫌疑。我想，陪审团或法官都打算等到下定决心判她无罪之后才开庭。”

“有什么好等的，”克罗斯比狂躁地说，“一开始就不应该把她抓起来。这个可怜的女孩儿已经受够了苦，他们居然还要让她经历审判的折磨，真是没良心！我回到新加坡后，不论男女，人人都说莱斯莉这样做天经地义。把她抓起来关这么久真是没道理。”

“法律就是法律。毕竟，她承认自己杀人了。真是太不幸了，我对你们深表同情。”

“我才不在乎呢。”克罗斯比打断他道。

“问题是，这桩罪案已经发生。现在是文明社会，审判在所难免。”

“杀死一个穷凶极恶的歹徒也算是谋杀吗？她射死他，跟射死一条疯狗有什么区别？”

乔伊斯先生重新斜靠在椅子上，再次将十指指尖合拢，形状看上去就像一个屋顶的框架一般，他沉默了一阵子。

“我是你的法律顾问，”他终于开口道，声音沉着冷静，一双棕色的眼睛冷冷地盯着他的诉讼委托人，“如果我不向你明言一个困扰我的细节，就是疏于职守。假如你的妻子只是向哈蒙德开了一枪，我们便胜券在握。问题是，她一共开了六枪。”

“她解释过了，很简单！在那种情形下，不论是谁都会那样做。”

“当然，”乔伊斯先生说，“我也认为这个解释合情合理，但我不想自欺欺人。换位思考总是好的。我不否认，即使我是王室检察官，也要将此视为最大疑点。”

“我亲爱的朋友，没必要做那种蠢事。”

乔伊斯先生目光锐利地瞥了罗伯特·克罗斯比一眼，他优美的嘴唇上掠过一丝微笑。克罗斯比是个良友，但着实不怎么聪明。

“也许是我多心了，”律师道，“我只是觉得这个细节值得一提。事情已经接近尾声，等这一切画上句号，我建议你和妻子离开此地，找个地方旅游一番，彻底忘掉这个噩梦。尽管无罪判决已差不多是板上钉钉之事，但谋杀案的审判总是一场折磨，事后你们需要休息。”

克罗斯比终于笑了。他一笑，仿佛换了一张脸，先前的粗笨一扫而空，你只能看见他灵魂深处的美好。

“我想我比莱斯莉更需要休息。她一直很坚强。感谢上帝吧，您的委托人是一个多么勇敢的弱女子。”

“是的，她的自制力真是太惊人了。”律师说，“她如此坚强，真是出乎我的意料。”

他是她的法律顾问，在克罗斯比太太被捕之后，两人自然需要频繁会面。尽管狱中的一切尽可能地为她安排得舒适妥帖，她毕竟是入狱了，等候指控她谋杀的审判，重压之下精神崩溃也是顺理成章之事，然而她却安之若素。她读了很多书，用一切机会舒展筋骨。当局特许她在狱中绣枕边，作为她借以消磨漫长岁月的一个小爱好。她端庄整洁地出现在乔伊斯先生面前，身上的连衣裙清凉素雅，头发梳得纹丝不乱，指甲修剪得漂漂亮亮。她谈笑自如，甚至不忘对目前的尴尬处境揶揄几句。谈到这个悲剧，她竟有些漫不经心，乔伊斯先生不禁想，多亏她的知书识礼，才让她避免了在此等逆境中失言。他从未意识到她也有幽默感，为此小小地吃了一惊。

他认识她很多年了，但不常见面。来新加坡时，她一般都会过来与他们夫妇共进晚宴，有几次还去了他们的海边别墅共度周末。他的妻子跟她在橡胶园里住过两个礼拜，见过杰弗里·哈蒙德几面。两对夫妇虽谈不上是密友，但也相处得相当愉快。因此，灾难发生后，罗伯特·克罗斯比马上赶到新加坡来，请求乔伊斯先生亲自为他不幸的妻子辩护。

从他第一次见到她起，她向他叙述的事情经过就从未变过，即便是在细枝末节上。悲剧发生后的几个小时，她就冷静沉着地叙述了一遍，和现在所说的一模一样。她的叙述连贯清晰，声音沉着冷静，只是在描述其中几个细节时，她稍稍有些不安，双颊泛红。她简直不可能招致此等横祸。这个三十一二岁的女人，弱不禁风，中等身段，要说她漂亮，倒不如说是优雅动人。她瘦骨嶙峋，手腕和脚踝精致纤巧，白皙的皮肤覆在手骨上，粗蓝的静脉清晰可见。一张没有血色的脸，略有点儿灰黄，嘴唇则是苍白的。她的眼睛平淡无奇，但她有许多淡棕色的头发，天然地微卷着，若稍微做一下美发，一定会漂亮得惊人，但克罗斯比太太绝不会让她的头发受那些设备摆布。她安静地喜悦着，不事张扬。她的言谈举止高贵迷人，但由于内敛自重，她在社交圈里过于默默无闻。这种情况完全无可指责，因为橡胶园主的妻子总是孤独地生活在深闺之中。可是，当她在自己家中与可靠的熟人相处时，会展现出一种静谧的魔力。乔伊斯太太和她住了两周，回家后告诉她丈夫说，莱斯莉是一位异常甜美可亲的女主人。乔伊斯太太说，她有许多外人意想不到的好处，若深入了解她，一定会惊叹她是多么的博览群书，又是多么的风流灵巧。

她是世间最不可能犯谋杀罪的女人。

乔伊斯先生费尽唇舌，总算让罗伯特·克罗斯比安下心来。他把克罗斯比送走，办公室里又只剩下他一人了，他随手翻起案情摘要来。但那只是机械性的动作，这份摘要他早已倒背如流。这件案子轰动一时，从新加坡到槟榔屿[2]，在整个半岛的俱乐部里和餐桌上，人们都在津津有味地谈论它。事实上克罗斯比太太陈述的案情相当简单。案发当晚她先生去新加坡出差，她独自一人在家。她自己到八点三刻才吃晚饭，饭后坐在客厅绣枕边。通往游廊的门开着，屋子里一个人也没有，仆人们都已返回屋后的住处休息。花园的碎石小路上忽然传来脚步声，把她吓得够戗。那是靴子的声音，来者一定是一位白人男士而非当地人，当地人总是把汽车直接开进来。她也不知道谁会那么晚来打扰她。那人拾阶而上，穿过游廊，在客厅门口停下脚步。她坐在一盏昏灯旁，而他站在黑暗中，她一时间没认出他是谁。

“我能进来吗？”他说。

她听不出是谁。

“是谁？”她问。

她原本戴着眼镜，说话时把它摘掉了。

“杰夫[3]·哈蒙德。”

“快请进。来喝点儿东西。”

她站起身，热情地同他握手。见到他多少有点儿惊讶，尽管他也算是邻居，但近来她和罗伯特不常与他见面，而她已经好几周没看见他了。他也有一个橡胶园，距离克罗斯比夫妇的橡胶园八英里。都这么晚了，也不知道他来找他们有什么要紧的事。

“罗伯特不在，”她说，“他去新加坡过夜了。”

也许他认为有必要解释一下自己的来访，便说：“真是抱歉。我今晚寂寞得难受，所以出来散散心，顺便来问候一下你们。”

“你是怎么来的？我没听到汽车的声音。”

“怕你们睡了，我把它停在下面的马路边。”

这个解释合情合理。庄园主每天要给工人们点名，只好起早贪黑，吃完晚饭就差不多要去睡觉了。警察第二天也确实在距离克罗斯比家四分之一英里处找到了哈蒙德的汽车。

罗伯特不在，客厅里没准备威士忌和苏打水。男仆很可能已经睡着了，莱斯莉没有叫他，亲自去端过来。客人自己混了一杯酒，点着烟斗。

杰夫·哈蒙德在这片殖民地人缘很广。他已年近四十，从小便出来闯荡。战争爆发后，他参加了第一批志愿军，战功卓著。两年后，他膝部受伤，被迫退役，带着优异服务勋章和十字勋章回到马来联邦。他是此地最好的台球手之一，过去也曾舞姿翩翩，网球也打得不错。虽然他无法再跳舞，膝盖受伤僵化后网球也大为退步，他却懂得如何让大家都喜欢他。他高大英俊，长着摄人心魄的碧眼和乌润浓密的鬈发。那些久惯老诚的人说他唯一的缺点就是太爱寻花问柳。等他终于招来杀身之祸，这些人赶忙摇头晃脑地宣称他们早料到他会毁在女人手里。

他开始和莱斯莉闲聊一些本地事务，新加坡近期要举办的赛事，橡胶的价格，还有他差点儿打死一只最近在附近出没的老虎。她急于按期绣完一条枕边，赶在母亲生日前寄回家，于是重新戴上眼镜，把椅子挪到摆着枕头的小桌旁边。

“你真该把这副牛角边眼镜换掉，”他说，“你为什么要把自己的花容月貌掩藏起来？”

这句话吓了她一跳。他之前从未用过这么奇怪的腔调跟她说话。她想最好不要在这个话题上纠缠不休。

“我可从来不觉得自己是个美人，如果你觉得这副眼镜不好看，我可以告诉你，我并不在意自己在你眼中的形象。”

“可我觉得你美艳绝伦。”

“你嘴可真甜，”她反讽道，“但你说出这样的话，我只会认为你头脑不正常。”

他咯咯地笑了。他站起来，在她身旁的椅子上坐下。

“那你总不能矢口否认你这双手精致玲珑得举世无双吧？”他说。

他作势要抓起她的一只手，她轻轻打了他一下。

“放尊重点儿。坐回去，好好说话，否则我就要请你打道回府。”

他一动不动。

“你难道不知道我已经对你爱得不能自拔了吗？”他说。

她仍然是一副凛然不可侵犯的模样。

“我不知道。我甚至都懒得相信这是真的。即使确实如此，我也不想你说出来。”

她真惊讶他竟如此口不择言。他们相识七年，他从未对她有过任何越轨之举。他退役后，常常与克罗斯比夫妇见面，有一次他生病了，罗伯特还自己开车将他接到了他们的小屋。他在克罗斯比家住了两周，但由于志趣相异，始终没有与他们成为好友。近两三年来，他们几乎不与他来往。他偶尔过来打网球，他们也偶尔在某个种植园主举办的派对上见到他，但更多的时候，他们整月整月地看不见他。

他又倒了一杯威士忌掺苏打水。莱斯莉不知道他之前喝没喝酒。他今天有些古怪，她心生疑虑。看着他毫不见外的样子，她柳眉紧蹙。

“如果我是你，就会少喝一点儿。”她说，依然客客气气的。

他自己干了一杯，把杯子放下。

“你以为我是因为喝醉了，才这么口无遮拦吗？”他唐突地发问。

“难道不是吗？”

“哼，当然不是。我对你一见倾心。我一直忍着没说，但我实在忍不下去了。我爱你，我爱你，我爱你。”

她站起来，小心翼翼地把枕头放到一旁。

“晚安。”她说。

“我不会走的。”

她终于发怒了。

“你这个大笨蛋，难道你不知道我对罗伯特是死心塌地的吗？即使我不爱罗伯特，也绝对不会爱上你。”

“管他呢，反正罗伯特不在家。”

“如果你不赶快滚出去，我就要叫男仆来把你扔出去了。”

“他们听不到。”

她怒不可遏，迈开脚步，像是要走到游廊去叫人，在那里仆人一定能听见她的叫声。但他抓住她的手臂。

“放开我！”她狂吼道。

“不可能，你逃不掉的。”

她大叫“来人，来人啊”，但他迅速捂住她的嘴。等她回过神来，意识到他的企图时，他已经将她紧紧抱住，如暴雨一般疯狂地亲吻她。她绝望地挣扎着，躲开他滚烫的双唇。

“快停下！”她喊道，“放开我，你这个禽兽！”

接下来的事情她却记不清楚了。之前他说的话，她记得丝毫不差，但从那刻起，他的话仿佛要穿过一层恐惧和害怕的迷雾才能进入她的耳朵。他似乎在恳求她做见不得人的事情。他失去了自制力，变得狂热残暴，像一个铁钳，紧紧地把她夹在怀里。在这个强壮而又孔武有力的男人面前，她是那样的无助，她的手臂被夹在身体两边无法动弹。她的挣扎都是徒劳，她感觉自己变得越来越虚弱，她担心自己随时都可能昏过去。他灼热的呼吸喷在她脸上，恶心至极。他亲吻她的嘴，她的眼睛，她的双颊，她的头发，他的臂力让她几欲窒息。她被举离地面。她奋力踢他，但他只会将她抱得更紧。他抱着她走动起来，不再说话，但他一定脸色苍白，双眼燃烧着欲火。他要把她抱进卧房。他变回原始的野蛮人，急不可耐地跑起来，却撞到一张挡住去路的桌子。膝盖僵硬的他腿脚本来就不灵便，加上抱着女人，一下子摔倒了。她抓住机会挣脱开来，跑到沙发后面。他闪电般站起来冲向她。桌上有一支左轮手枪。她不是一个神经兮兮的人，但罗伯特那天晚上不在家，她打算睡觉时把枪拿进卧房以防不测，因此它碰巧在那里。她已经被吓得丧失了理智，不知道自己在做什么，只是听到一声枪响。她看见哈蒙德踉跄几步，喊了一声，还说了几句话，但她没听清。他跌跌撞撞地逃出房间到游廊上，她已经因为恐惧和愤怒发了狂，追着他出去，是的，就是那样，她肯定是追着他出去了，尽管她对此毫无印象。她下意识地一边扣动扳机，一边追了出去，一枪又一枪，直到六颗子弹都射光了。哈蒙德倒在游廊的地板上，缩成一个血堆。

仆人们被枪声惊醒，慌慌张张地冲上来时，看见她站在哈蒙德身边，手中仍然攥着枪，哈蒙德已经断了气。她一言不发地看了他们一眼，他们战战兢兢地站拢成一团。她松开手，让手枪落到地板上，默默转身走进客厅，并在他们的目光中走进卧房，把门锁上。他们被吓得魂飞魄散，不敢碰尸体，只是望着它，眼中充满恐惧，惊慌失措地交头接耳。仆役长是一名华人，服侍克罗斯比夫妇多年，头脑比较清醒。他勉强打起精神来，寻思如何打破僵局。罗伯特骑摩托车去新加坡，汽车还留在车库里。仆役长知道必须马上把这一意外事故通知给助理地区警长，便叫司机把车开来，一边拾起枪放进口袋。助理地区警长名叫威瑟斯，住在离此地最近的城市市郊，大约三十五英里远。一个半小时后，他们到达他家，所有人都已就寝，他们不得不把仆役叫起来。过了一会儿，威瑟斯现身，仆役长告诉他来访因由，把枪交给他作证。警长进房穿衣，并叫人把车开来，迅速上路。他跟随他们驶过荒凉的道路，到达克罗斯比家时，天刚破晓。警长跑上走廊的台阶，看到哈蒙德的尸体便立刻停下。尸体仍在原地。他摸摸尸体的脸，已经是冷的。

“夫人在哪里？”他问男仆。

仆役长指指卧房，威瑟斯上前去敲门。没有应答。他再敲。

“克罗斯比太太！”他喊道。

“是谁？”

“威瑟斯。”

又过了一会儿，锁开了，门慢慢打开。莱斯莉出现在他跟前。她一夜未眠，身上仍然是晚餐时穿的宽松女袍。她站着，无声地看着警官。

“您的仆役长请我来的，”他说，“哈蒙德——您做了什么？”

“他要非礼我，我向他开枪了。”

“天啊。您最好出来，详细地告诉我事情的经过。”

“现在不行。我做不到。您必须给我点儿时间。请把我丈夫叫回来。”

威瑟斯少不更事，不懂得如何处理这种意料之外的紧急局面。罗伯特回家后，莱斯莉才肯开口，她告诉两人事发经过。此后她把这个故事重复了无数遍，但每遍都与最初的陈述毫无二致。

开枪的细节一直困扰着乔伊斯先生。作为她的律师，他无论如何想不明白她为什么要开六枪，而不是仅开一枪。尸检发现有四枪是近身射击，这难免引人怀疑，哈蒙德倒下后，她还站在旁边冲他打光了子弹。她承认自己一直清晰无误的记忆到这里就中断了，大脑变得一片空白。那表明她陷入了出离的愤怒之中，但这样一位娴静从容的女士怎么可能陷入出离的愤怒之中？乔伊斯先生与她相识多年，一直感觉她是一个麻木无情的人，而且在悲剧发生后的这几周里，她自始至终展现出惊人的镇静。

乔伊斯先生耸耸肩。

“事实也许是，”他想道，“在最值得尊敬的女人身上，潜藏着多么可怕的野性，这是一个永恒的谜。”

有人敲门。

“请进。”

那位华人助理走进来，鬼鬼祟祟地把身后的门轻轻关上，面色凝重地走到乔伊斯先生跟前。

“很抱歉打搅您，先生，我想私下与您沟通几句。”他说。

这位助理说起话来总是字斟句酌，把乔伊斯先生都逗笑了。

“别这么客气，智生。”他回答道。

“先生，我急于向您汇报之事，是机密的，对案情的影响甚是微妙。”

“请讲。”

乔伊斯先生撞上助理精明的目光。王智生的穿着打扮可谓一如既往地入时，时髦的皮鞋油光锃亮，丝质短袜色彩艳丽，黑领带，珠光宝气的领带夹，左手无名指上一只明晃晃的钻戒，整洁的白色外衣口袋里突出来一根金自来水笔和一根金铅笔。他戴着金腕表，鼻梁上架一副透明的夹鼻眼镜。他轻轻咳嗽了一声。

“此事与克罗斯比一案有关。”

“请往下说。”

“我了解到一个情况，先生，它推翻了我此前对此案的看法。”

“什么情况？”

“先生，我听说被告写了一封信给这场悲剧中不幸的受害者。”

“这有什么值得惊讶的。他们认识了整整七年，克罗斯比太太写信给哈蒙德先生的机会多的是。”

乔伊斯先生很清楚这个助理有多么聪明，他这么说，是在故意装糊涂。

“当然如此，先生。克罗斯比太太无疑需要频繁地和死者通信，例如邀请他共进晚宴，或是提议一起打网球赛。听到这封信时，这也是我的第一反应。然而，这封信是在哈蒙德先生去世当天写的。”

乔伊斯先生连眼睛也没有眨一下。他继续看着王智生，微笑着，表现出淡淡的兴趣，和王智生交谈时，他一般都是这副表情。

“你从哪儿听来的？”

“我朋友那里，先生。”

乔伊斯先生深知没必要追问下去。

“您应该还记得，先生，克罗斯比太太陈述道，事发前她已经有好几周没与死者联系。”

“那封信在你手上吗？”

“没有，先生。”

“信上写了什么？”

“我朋友给了我一份誊抄本。请您过目，先生。”

“好的。”

王智生从贴身暗袋里掏出一个胀鼓鼓的钱夹，里面装满各色纸片、新加坡币和烟卡。他迅速从这堆乱纸中抽出半张便条纸，放在乔伊斯先生前面。该信内容如下：





罗今晚不回家，我一定要见你。我等你，十一点。我什么都顾不上了，你要敢不来，后果自负。切记把车停在外面。——莱





笔迹很流利，是这个华人在外国学校接受教导的成果之一。如此凶险的话，根本不像是用这么平平无奇的字体写出来的。

“你为什么会认为这张字条是克罗斯比太太写的？”

“我的信息来源非常可靠，”王智生回答道，“而且很容易证明其真实性。毫无疑问，克罗斯比太太能够马上告诉您她是否写过这张便条。”

乔伊斯先生一直盯着这个助理那张毕恭毕敬的脸，此刻他疑心这张脸上有没有恶作剧的蛛丝马迹。

“克罗斯比太太居然写了这样一封信，简直不可思议。”乔伊斯先生说。

“如果您持这种态度，先生，这件事情到此为止。我朋友向我透露此信息，仅仅是因为他考虑到我是您的助理。在和副检察官沟通之前，你可能会想知道这封信的存在。”

“原件在哪里？”乔伊斯先生厉声问道。

王智生不动声色，仿佛他并未从此问题中察觉出乔伊斯先生态度的转变。

“先生，您一定没有忘记，哈蒙德先生死后，人们发现他和一个中国女人纠缠不清。现在信在她手中。”

这是把哈蒙德先生推向风口浪尖的诸多丑闻之一。大家都知道了他曾和一个中国女人同居数月。

两人陷入了沉默。实际上，话已经说完了，两人的心思都瞒不过对方。

“谢谢你，智生。我会仔细考虑此事。”

“您客气了，先生。您希望我就此事和我朋友沟通一下吗？”

“你最好和他保持联络。”乔伊斯先生板着脸说。

“好的，先生。”

助理一声不响地退出房间，再次从容地把门关上，留下乔伊斯先生在办公室里苦苦思索。他盯着誊抄本上平平无奇的整洁笔迹，隐隐生疑。他感到不妙，努力想把这种怀疑从脑子里驱除出去。莱斯莉肯定可以第一时间给出一个简单直接的解释，但是，天啊，他需要这个解释！他站起身，把信放进口袋，拿起遮阳帽。他出去的时候，王智生正坐在办公桌前埋头写文件。

“我出去一会儿，智生。”他说。

“乔治·里德先生约好十二点来访，先生，我该如何向他解释？”

乔伊斯先生微微一笑。

“你可以说你也不知道我在哪里。”

他要去的是监狱，他知道王智生对此心知肚明。尽管事发地点在荷兰村[4]，审判也定在当地举行，由于在监狱中拘留一个白人女士有着诸多不便，克罗斯比太太被关押在新加坡。

她被带进等候室，向他伸出优雅消瘦的手，粲然一笑。她和往常一样，穿戴简单朴素，一头浓密的淡棕色头发梳理得一丝不苟。

“真没想到今天早上能看见您。”她彬彬有礼地说。

恍惚之间，乔伊斯先生仿佛坐在她的家中，她好像正要叫男仆去给他把苦杜松子酒端来。

“你还好吗？”他问。

“好得不得了，谢谢您。”她的双眸闪过一丝喜悦的光芒，“这真是静养的好地方。”

看守离开了，房间里只剩下他们两人。

“请坐。”莱斯莉道。

他拿过一张椅子来坐下。他不知该如何开口。她一副若无其事的模样，他简直无法向她提起信的事情。尽管她谈不上漂亮，却很有些楚楚动人。不像社交场上那些装腔作势的女士，她因知书识礼而显得落落大方、雍容娴雅。她的社交圈子和生活环境简单纯粹，加上她弱如蒲柳，更显温柔娴静，看上去与任何粗野之事无涉。

“我真希望罗伯特下午来看我，”她说，声音自然动听（听她讲话可谓一大快事，她的声音和口音能够忠实地传达出这个阶级特有的气质），“可怜的孩子，真是难为他了。谢天谢地，再过几天就全部结束了。”

“离审判只有五天了。”

“我知道。每天早上醒来时，我就对自己说，‘又少了一天’。”她说着不禁笑了起来，“就像从前上学那会儿，快要放假的时候一样。”

“顺便问一句，我想事发之前你有好几周不曾和哈蒙德联系过，是不是？”

“我很肯定没有。我们最后一次见面还是在麦法伦斯网球赛上。我没怎么跟他说话。那里有两块场地，我们碰巧不在一起。”

“你也没有给他写信？”

“没有。”

“你确定？”

“确定。”她回答，淡淡一笑，“我给他写信，也不过是请他过来吃饭，或是打网球。我有好几个月没做这两件事了。”

“你曾经一度与他过从甚密，为什么突然对他如此冷淡？”

克罗斯比太太耸耸她瘦削的肩膀。

“也许是厌倦了吧。我们总有点儿话不投机。当然，他生病的时候，罗伯特和我曾竭尽所能帮他渡过难关，但最近这一两年，他非常健康，也从不寂寞。他忙于奔赴各种社交场合，看上去没必要再给他添麻烦了。”

“你确定就只是这样？”

克罗斯比太太犹疑了一会儿。

“不妨告诉您另一个原因。我们听说他和一个中国女人同居，罗伯特不愿意让他弄脏我们的屋子。我还亲眼见过那个女人。”

乔伊斯先生坐在一张直背扶手椅上，手托下巴，直直盯着莱斯莉。她说这句话的时候，他仿佛看见一道粗钝的红光闪过她黑色的双瞳，十分恐怖。乔伊斯先生挪了挪椅子，他又把十根手指尖尖相对。他谨慎地缓缓说道：

“我想，我有必要告诉你，有人发现了一封你亲自写给杰夫·哈蒙德的信。”

他密切地注视着她。她无动于衷，但过了一段时间才做出回应。

“过去我常常给他写便条，请他帮各种忙。要是我知道他去新加坡，就托他带点儿东西。”

“这封信是邀请他来见你，因为罗伯特要去新加坡。”

“那不可能，我从没写过那样的信。”

“你最好自己看看这张便条。”

他把便条从口袋里拿出来递给她。她扫了一眼，冷笑着把便条还给他。

“这可不是我的笔迹。”

“我知道，听说这只是一字不差的誊抄本。”

她现在认真地读起便条来，浑身上下发生了可怕的变化：和颜悦色的脸变得惨绿，看上去狰狞恐怖；身上的肉仿佛一下子掉得精光，皮肤紧紧绷在骨头上；嘴唇往后缩，露出牙齿，仿佛在做鬼脸。她用暴突出来的眼睛盯着乔伊斯先生，他眼前的人变成了一具语无伦次的骷髅。

“这是什么意思？”她轻声道。

她嘴唇太干了，只能嘶嘶地哑声说话，像鬼一样。

“应该由我来问你。”他回答。

“我没有写它。我发誓我没有写它。”

“话不能乱讲。如果原件是你的笔迹，否认也是徒劳的。”

“那是伪造的。”

“要证明它是伪造的很难，但要证明它是真的易如反掌。”

她清瘦的身子打了一个寒战，额头渗出大粒的汗珠来。她从包里掏出一张手帕擦干手心，又看了信一眼，斜着眼睛望着乔伊斯先生。

“上面没有日期。如果我真的写了这封信，却又把它忘得一干二净，那可能是很多年前写的。给我一点儿时间，我会尝试回忆起当时的情景来。”

“这点我注意到了。如果检察官拿到这封信，一定会仔细盘查仆人，很快便能知道有没有人在哈蒙德遇难当天给他送去一封信。”

克罗斯比太太把双手绞在一起，已经坐不稳了，他以为她会晕过去。

“我向您发誓，我没写那封信。”

乔伊斯先生沉默不语。他把目光从她扭曲的脸上移开，低下头去，陷入沉思。

“如果你是这种态度，我们就没有必要再谈下去。”他终于打破沉默，慢慢地说，“如果手握这封信的人认为应该把它交到检察官手中，你必须有所准备。”

他已经清晰地暗示自己的话已经说完了，但坐着不动，没有要离开的意思。他在等。在他，仿佛已经等了好几个世纪。他没有抬头看莱斯莉，但他知道她也坐着不动。房间里一片死寂。最后还是他打破了僵局。

“如果你要对我说的话已经说完了，我就回办公室去了。”

“看到这封信的人会怎么想？”她问他。

“认为你故意撒谎了。”乔伊斯先生直截了当地说。

“我什么时候撒谎了？”

“你信誓旦旦地说，你和哈蒙德已经有好几个月没有联系过。”

“这件事整个地对我打击太大了。那晚发生的一切太可怕，简直是一场噩梦。我忘记了某个细节也是正常的。”

“他遇害当晚去找你，完全是因为你歇斯底里地要见他。你把如此重要的事情忘掉了，却能如数家珍地讲出与哈蒙德交谈的每一个细节，这多少有点儿说不过去。”

“我并未忘记此事，只是事发后不敢提起它。要是我承认他是应邀赴约，你们就不会相信我的口供。是的，我是很傻，但我当时已经魂不守舍，随口说出好久没和哈蒙德联系的话来，想改口也来不及了。”

莱斯莉已经恢复镇定。乔伊斯先生向她投去赞赏的目光，她坦荡荡地与他对视。她恬静温柔，很容易消释他人的怀疑。

“既然如此，检察官会要求你解释为什么趁罗伯特不回家过夜时叫哈蒙德来见你。”

她直直地盯着律师。他总以为那是一双普通的眼睛，但他错了，他突然发现它们很迷人。此刻，这双眼睛隐隐地闪烁着泪光，清亮生辉。她的声音有点儿哽咽。

“我正准备给罗伯特一个惊喜。他下个月生日，我知道他想要一支新手枪。您也知道，我对这些东西一窍不通。我想找杰夫商量，请他帮我订购一支。”

“看来你是记不清这封信的措辞了吧，要不要再看一眼？”

“不，我不想再看它。”她立刻说道。

“你觉得，一位女士会因为咨询买枪的事情而给一位生疏的朋友写这样的信吗？”

“那确实有些小题大做。但我就是这么有口无心，我不得不承认那很蠢。”她微微一笑，“毕竟，杰夫·哈蒙德不能算是生疏的朋友，他生病的时候我像母亲一样无微不至地照料过他。我趁罗伯特不在家的时候请他过来，是因为罗伯特不许他上门。”

乔伊斯先生坐乏了，站起来在房间里走了几圈，思考接下来应该说什么。他斜倚在刚才坐过的椅子上，缓慢而艰难地道：

“克罗斯比太太，我希望非常严肃地与你谈谈。这个案子进展得相当顺利，唯独有一点令我困惑不已，我了解到，在哈蒙德倒地后，你至少还瞄准他开了四枪。很难想象一位像你这么瘦弱的女士，生性温柔，知书达理，一向沉着冷静，受惊后竟会彻底丧失理智。当然，这种情况也不是完全没有可能发生。尽管杰弗里·哈蒙德备受欢迎，声誉良好，我已经下定决心要证实你对他的指控，还你清白。他死后，人们发现他和一个中国女人同居，这个不光彩的事实已经使他身败名裂，情况对我们极为有利。我无论如何也要抓住他这个污点，所有德高望重的人都会因此对他嗤之以鼻。今天早上，我向你丈夫保证你将被判无罪释放，这并不是在安慰他。我相信陪审团的倾向相当明显。”

他们四目相对。克罗斯比太太仍然一动不动，十分古怪。她像一只被毒蛇蛊惑住的小鸟，动弹不得。他继续不紧不慢地说道：

“但这封信的出现完全改变了局面。我是你的辩护律师，将代表你出庭。我必须相信你的口供，并据此为你辩护。私底下我可能相信你的口供，也可能怀疑它。辩护律师的职责是说服法庭，现有证据不足以引致有罪判决，至于我个人是否认为你有罪，那是无关紧要的。”

莱斯莉的眼中闪过一丝笑意，他吃了一惊。他的自尊心受到了伤害，语气冷淡下来，继续说道：

“你不会否认哈蒙德是因为你那封十万火急的信才去找你的吧？我就是说你气急败坏地邀请他过来，也不过分。”

克罗斯比太太迟疑着，仿佛在思索。

“他们可以证实那封信是由你的仆人送去他家，并且连他骑自行车去也知道。

“你不要低估人们的智商。尽管他们现在相信你的话，但是这封信会使他们生疑。我不想与你分享我看到这封信时的心情，我只希望你能想想如何洗脱自己的死罪嫌疑。”

克罗斯比太太惊叫一声，跳起来，害怕得面如死灰。

“难道你认为他们会判我绞刑？”

“假如他们裁定你杀害哈蒙德的行为并非正当防卫，陪审团有责任做出有罪判决，罪名是谋杀。法官必须依法判你死刑。”

“但他们有什么证据？”她喘着气道。

“我不知道。但你心里有数。你大可不必向我坦白。只是，假如他们起了疑心，针对你展开调查，假如他们盘问当地人——你觉得他们会发现什么？”

她突然崩溃倒地，他根本来不及扶住她。她晕了过去。他急得团团转，想找来一杯水。房间里没有水，他又不想惊动看守，便帮她平躺在地，在她身边蹲下来，等她苏醒。她醒来时，双眼充满恐惧，把他吓得六神无主。

“躺着别动，”他说，“一会儿就好。”

“请不要让他们绞死我。”她有气无力地说。

她发狂一般大哭起来，他连忙低声安慰她。

“看在上帝的分儿上，请你振作起来。”他说。

“给我一点儿时间。”

她实在是胆色过人。他看着她竭尽全力控制住情绪，迅速镇静了下来。

“请扶我起来。”

他把手递给她，拉她起身，搀她坐到椅子上。她精疲力竭地坐下。

“请让我冷静几分钟。”她说。

“好的。”

等到她终于开口说话，却是语出惊人。她轻轻叹了一口气。

“恐怕我把事情弄到了不可收拾的地步。”她说。

他没有回答，两人再度陷入沉默。

“难道我们无法取得那封信吗？”她终于说道。

“如果信的持有者不打算卖掉它，我就不会知道它的存在。”

“它在谁手里？”

“在和哈蒙德同居的中国女人手里。”

莱斯莉的脸红一阵白一阵的。

“她肯定想趁机敲诈一笔。”

“我想她很清楚这封信的价值，看来要花一笔巨款。”

“难道您要见死不救吗？”

“这件证物对我们如此不利，你以为她会那么容易就交给我们吗？那无异于贿赂证人。你没有权利要求我以身试法。”

“那他们会怎么对我？”

“依法宣判。”

她的脸色死一般苍白，浑身一阵颤抖。

“请您为我做主。当然我无权请求您铤而走险。”

乔伊斯先生没想到她一向自控得法的声音呜咽起来是如此令人于心不忍。她茫然无措地望着他，假使他拒绝伸出援手，也许终生无法释怀。毕竟，逝者已矣，可怜的哈蒙德不可能起死回生了。他很想知道那封信的玄机，仅凭它就判定哈蒙德并非因为把她逼得走投无路才招致杀身之祸，显然有失公正。他在远东混迹已久，职业操守也许远不如二十年前高尚。他望着地板，做了一个决定。他知道这样做不对，因此羞于启齿，暗暗怨恨着莱斯莉。他甚至开始憎恶自己的声音。

“我不太清楚你丈夫的财产情况。”

她飞红了脸，瞥他一眼。

“他持有许多锡矿股份以及几个橡胶园的少量股份。我想他能筹到钱。”

“我必须告诉他这笔钱的去处。”

她沉默了一会儿，仿佛在思索。

“他还深爱着我。他会不惜一切代价救我。您要给他看那封信吗？”

乔伊斯先生皱皱眉头。她立刻察觉到了，继续说道：

“罗伯特是您的老朋友。我不是在求您为我效劳，我是在求您解救一个单纯善良的人。他从未伤害过您，我想您也一定不忍心看见他受罪。”

乔伊斯先生没有回应她的话，站起来要走。克罗斯比太太像往常一样自然优雅地伸出手。受到这场突如其来的惊吓，她看起来有点儿黯然憔悴，但依旧强打精神，祝他一切顺利。

“谢谢您帮我处理这么棘手的事情，我的感激之情无以言表。”

乔伊斯先生回到办公室，也没有心思工作，只闷坐着胡思乱想，脑海里闪过各种奇怪的画面。他有点儿不寒而栗。最后，他如愿听到那阵鬼鬼祟祟的敲门声。王智生推门进来。

“我正要出去吃午饭，先生。”他道。

“去吧。”

“请问在我出去之前您有什么事情吩咐吗，先生？”

“暂时没有。里德先生有没有重新预约？”

“重新预约过了，先生。他下午三点钟过来。”

“很好。”

王智生转身走到门口，把细长的手指放在门把手上。仿佛突然想起有话未说，又反身回来。

“请问您有什么话要对我的朋友说吗，先生？我很乐意代为转达。”

尽管王智生的英文说得如此漂亮，仍然有一个音永远发不准，把朋友说成“甭友”。

“什么朋友？”

“您大概还记得克罗斯比太太写过一封信给已故的哈蒙德先生吧。”

“啊，我还真忘了。我与克罗斯比太太谈过这件事，她否认写过那样的信。那明显是伪造的。”

乔伊斯先生把誊抄本从口袋里拿出来，递给王智生。王智生没有伸手去接。

“既然如此，先生，我想不会有人反对我的‘甭友’把信呈交副检察官。”

“不会。但我不知道那样做对你的朋友有什么好处。”

“我的‘甭友’，先生，一向将维护正义视为己责。”

“我绝不会阻止任何人履行自己的责任，智生。”

律师和华人助理四目相对。他们都面无表情，但对彼此的想法都心知肚明。

“您当然不会，先生，”王智生说，“但根据我对此案的研究，我认为这样一封信对我们的委托人极为不利。”

“我一向很欣赏你敏锐的法律意识，智生。”

“先生，我发现，如果我可以说服我的‘甭友’诱使这位中国女人把信交给我们，事情就简单多了。”

乔伊斯先生漫不经心地在吸墨纸上画人脸。

“我猜你的朋友是个商人。他会开出什么条件？”

“信在那位中国女人手里，他只是这个女人的亲戚。这个女人是个糊涂的人，若不是我‘甭友’告诉她，她也不知道那封信的价值。”

“你朋友怎么说？”

“他说这封信值一万叻币[5]，先生。”

“天啊！你居然认为克罗斯比太太拿得出一万叻币！你听好了，那封信是伪造的。”

说这话的时候，他抬起头暴怒地看着王智生。助理不为所动，站在桌子的另一旁，彬彬有礼，怡然自若，毕恭毕敬。

“克罗斯比先生持有勿洞橡胶园八分之一的股份和南河橡胶园六分之一的股份。如果他肯拿这些股份作抵押，我有一个‘甭友’可以借钱给他。”

“你认识的人真不少，智生。”

“没错，先生。”

“你可以让他们趁早死心。这封信很好解释，依我看，克罗斯比先生最多出五千叻币。”

“那位中国女人并不想把这封信卖掉，先生。我的‘甭友’费尽唇舌才说服了她，一万叻币是底线。”

乔伊斯先生死死地盯着王智生。助理恭顺地低头站着，毫无窘态。乔伊斯先生知道他是什么人。他想，王智生，你也太聪明了，你能从中渔利多少呢？

“一万叻币可不是笔小数目。”

“克罗斯比先生当然愿意出这笔钱，他不会眼睁睁看着自己的妻子被绞死。”

乔伊斯先生又沉默了。王智生还藏了什么话？他一口咬定这是底线，看来已经胸有成竹。不管谁是幕后主使，这个人肯定十分清楚这是罗伯特·克罗斯比刚好能拿得出来的一笔钱，绝对不会让步。

“那个中国女人现在在哪里？”乔伊斯先生问。

“我‘甭友’家，先生。”

“她愿意到这儿来吗？”

“我想最好还是您去找她，先生。今晚我可以为您带路，她会把信给您。她很糊涂，先生，看不懂支票。”

“我没打算给她支票。我会付现金。”

“假如您带的现金不足数，只会浪费您的宝贵时间。”

“不用你说。”

“我吃完午饭便去通知‘甭友’。”

“很好，请你今晚十点在俱乐部外面等我。”

“谢谢，先生。”王智生说。

王智生向乔伊斯先生微微鞠了一躬便出去了。乔伊斯先生也外出吃饭，在俱乐部如愿见到了罗伯特·克罗斯比。他坐在一张拥挤的桌子旁，乔伊斯先生找座位时顺道经过他，拍拍他的肩膀。

“在你走之前我想和你谈谈。”他说。

“我正好也找您呢，您吃完饭就叫我吧。”

对于这次谈话，乔伊斯先生已经心里有数。午饭后，他去打桥牌，等俱乐部里的人自然散去。他不想专门就此事与克罗斯比在办公室见面。克罗斯比走进棋牌室看他打牌，牌局结束后，众人各自去忙自己的事，棋牌室里只剩下他们两人。

“老朋友，我有一个坏消息要告诉你，”乔伊斯先生尽量让自己听起来平淡随意，“哈蒙德被杀当晚，似乎你的妻子给他送了一封信请他过来。”

“怎么可能！”克罗斯比喊道，“她一直说自己根本不与哈蒙德联系。据我所知她已经有好几个月没见过他了。”

“但她确实写了那封信。这封信目前在和哈蒙德同居的中国女人手里。你的妻子想托哈蒙德帮她买一份礼物给你庆祝生日。那个悲剧令她情绪失控，完全忘记了此事，否认联系过哈蒙德，如今她也没有勇气承认错误了。这当然很不幸，但也实属自然。”

克罗斯比没有说话。他那张又大又红的脸露出困惑的神情，乔伊斯先生马上放下心来，却又觉得不耐烦。他太蠢了，乔伊斯先生讨厌在蠢人身上浪费时间。但想到事发以来他受到的种种折磨，律师忽然对他生出无限的同情。克罗斯比太太以丈夫的名义请求帮助，恰恰戳中了律师心中最柔软的地方。

“很明显，如果这封信被送到检察官手里，无疑会节外生枝。你的妻子说了谎话，检察官会要求她解释这个谎言。如果哈蒙德没有不请自来，不是一个不速之客，而是应邀上门，事情就没有那么简单。陪审团的立场很容易因此动摇。”

乔伊斯先生犹豫了。他必须执行自己的决定。如果有时间开玩笑，他一定会嘲讽自己，因为他突然想到，他马上要为了眼前这个人作奸犯科，这个人对问题的严重性却还懵然不知。但即使克罗斯比细思之，也很可能只会以为这是乔伊斯先生的例行公事。

“我亲爱的罗伯特，你不仅是我的委托人，还是我的朋友。我想我们必须拿到那封信，但那要花很多钱，否则我情愿瞒住你。”

“要花多少钱？”

“一万叻币。”

“那也太多了吧。现在时世艰难，诸事不顺，这简直是要我倾家荡产。”

“你能立刻筹齐这笔钱吗？”

“差不多吧。要是我拿锡矿和两个庄园的股份作抵押，老查理·梅多斯会借给我的。”

“那你愿意吗？”

“我不得不这么做吗？”

“如果你希望你的妻子被判无罪释放的话。”

克罗斯比涨红了脸，龇牙咧嘴的一脸怪相。

“但……”他不知道说什么好，脸色已经发紫了，“但我不懂。她可以解释。您不是要告诉我，他们会判她有罪吧？他们怎么可以因为她杀掉这个人人喊打的歹徒而绞死她呢？”

“他们当然不会绞死她，可能只会裁定她误杀，判两三年有期徒刑。”

克罗斯比跳起来，万分惊恐之下，他红扑扑的脸变得狰狞可怖。

“三年。”

刹那间，迟钝的他仿佛想起了某件事情。一道闪电突然划破黑暗，尽管接下来的黑暗依然如前一般深邃，某段回忆却被短暂地照亮了。乔伊斯先生看见克罗斯比那双因久经历练而长满老茧的红色巨手在颤抖。

“她想给我买什么礼物？”

“她说想送你一支新的手枪。”

克罗斯比的巨脸再度涨得通红。

“这笔钱什么时候要？”

此时他的声音有点儿奇怪，仿佛喉咙被一双隐形的手死死掐着。

“今晚十点。麻烦你六点左右带着钱来我办公室。”

“那女人会来找你吗？”

“不，我去找她。”

“我会带上钱，到时跟您一起去。”

乔伊斯先生用锋利的目光看着他。

“你觉得有这个必要吗？我认为你最好把这件事交给我全权处理。”

“那是我的钱吧？我要去。”

乔伊斯先生耸耸肩。他们起身握手，乔伊斯先生盯着他，仿佛对他很感兴趣似的。

十点钟，他们在空荡荡的俱乐部见面。

“准备好了？”乔伊斯先生问。

“是的，我把钱放口袋里了。”

“那走吧。”

他们走下楼梯。乔伊斯先生的车在静悄悄的广场上等着他们。他们走向汽车时，王智生从一座房子的阴影中大步走出，坐到司机旁边指路。他们驶过欧洲酒店和水手之家[6]，开上维多利亚街。街上的中国商店仍未打烊，流浪汉在街上四处游荡，黄包车、汽车和马车匆忙来去。车突然停了，王智生转过来。

“我想我们最好是在这里下车走过去，先生。”他说。

他们下了车，他负责引路，另外两人隔着几步的距离跟在后面。过了一会儿，他请他们停步。

“请您在这里等一下，先生。我进去知会我‘甭友’一声。”

他走进一间临街的商店，有几个华人站在柜台后面。总有一些奇怪的商店，里面什么商品也看不见，不知道做的是什么生意，这间就是其中之一。他们看见他和一个矮胖的男人说话。那男人穿着唐装，胸前挂一条巨大的金项链，迅速向外面扫了一眼，交给王智生一把钥匙，王智生走出来，向在一旁等待的两人点头示意，溜进商店的侧门。他们跟着他来到一条楼梯下面。

“请等一会儿，我点根火柴。”他说，多么机灵，“请上楼。”

他在他们前面举着一根日本火柴，但几乎没有用，他们摸索着跟在他后面一步步走上二楼。他打开一扇门，进房点亮煤油灯。

“请进。”他说。

房间很小，四方形，有一扇窗户，家具只有两张铺着席子的中式床。角落放着一个大箱子，锁非常精致，箱子上有一个破旧的托盘，摆着鸦片烟枪和一盏灯。一股微微辛辣的鸦片烟味弥漫着。两人坐下来，王智生给他们递烟。过了一会儿，刚才站在柜台后面的那个矮胖华人进来了，他用娴熟的英文向他们问好，在他的同胞身旁坐下。

“那位女士马上来。”王智生说。

商店的伙计把茶端上来，矮胖的华人请他们用茶，克罗斯比拒绝了。两位华人悄声交谈，克罗斯比和乔伊斯先生沉默不语。过了很久，外面传来人声，有人低声叫唤，那个矮胖的华人走到门边，开门说了几句话，请一个女人进来。乔伊斯先生仔细端详她。哈蒙德过世后，她艳名远播，乔伊斯先生现在总算能一睹其真容了。她略微有些发福，年纪也偏大，大脸盘，一副漠然的神气，粉光脂艳，眉毛描成细长的黑线，有一种悍然的魔力。她穿着淡蓝上衣和白裙，打扮得不中不西的，但踩着一双小巧的中式丝面织锦拖鞋。她戴着沉沉的金项链、金手镯、金耳环，乌黑的发髻上插着金簪子。她缓缓步入，昂然自信，但步伐有点儿沉滞。她在王智生旁边的床上坐下，他对她说了几句话，她点点头，淡淡地斜了两位白人男士一眼。

“她带着信吧？”乔伊斯先生问。

“是的，先生。”

克罗斯比一言不发，掏出一卷五百元的钞票，数出两百张递给王智生。

“你数数看对不对。”

助理点了一遍，把钱递给那位矮胖的华人。

“没问题，先生。”

那矮胖的华人又数了一次，把钱放进口袋。他又向女人说话，她从怀里摸出一封信递给王智生，王智生看了一眼。

“就是这封信，先生。”他说。他正要把信交给乔伊斯先生，克罗斯比一手抢了过去。

“给我看看。”他说。

乔伊斯先生看着他把信读完，向他伸出手。

“还是交给我来保管吧。”

克罗斯比小心地把它折起来，放进口袋。

“不，我要自己留着，这封信可真够贵的。”

乔伊斯先生没有坚持。三个华人旁观着这场小型纷争，但他们的表情过于冷漠，看不出他们的感想。也许他们根本就没有感想。乔伊斯先生站起来。

“今晚还有什么吩咐吗，先生？”王智生说。

“没有了。”他知道助理想留下来分赃，便转向克罗斯比，“好了吗？”

克罗斯比没有回答，直接站起身。那矮胖的华人走到门边给他们开门。王智生找到一小截蜡烛点着，为他们照路，和同伴一起把他们送到街上。那女人留下来，安静地坐在床上抽烟。两位华人在街上与他们道别，回身上楼。

“你想怎样处理这封信？”乔伊斯先生问。

“留着它。”

他们回到车上，乔伊斯先生想送朋友一程，但克罗斯比摇摇头。

“我想走走。”他犹豫了一会儿，迈开沉重的步子，“哈蒙德被杀那晚，我之所以去新加坡，其中一件事是找熟人买支新枪，他正好要出手。晚安。”

黑夜迅速吞噬了他。

乔伊斯先生对审判结果的判断非常准确。开庭时，陪审团已经决定无论如何也要宣判克罗斯比太太无罪。她亲自作证，清晰简洁地陈述了案情。副检察官面软心慈，显出一副他仅仅是在公事公办的样子，随便问了几个例行的问题，结案陈词基本上是被告的辩护词。陪审团花了不到五分钟就做出了众望所归的判决，挤满法庭的人群沸腾了，雷鸣般的掌声不绝于耳。法官祝贺克罗斯比太太重获自由。

没有人比乔伊斯太太对哈蒙德的兽行更为义愤填膺。她对朋友总是赤诚相见，早就说好等审判结束后把克罗斯比夫妇接到自己家中小住一阵，等一切安排妥当后再离开。她跟所有人一样认定克罗斯比太太会被判无罪，当然不能让可怜的、亲爱的、勇敢的莱斯莉直接返回惨案现场。审讯十二点半结束，他们到达乔伊斯家时，丰盛的午餐和上等的鸡尾酒已经待客多时。乔伊斯太太特意准备了在马来亚联合邦久负盛名的天价鸡尾酒，祝莱斯莉早日恢复健康。她是一位活泼健谈的主妇，此刻更是兴高采烈。也幸好她是这样没眼色，不然就没人说话了。不过也没什么好怀疑的，她的丈夫向来抱定“沉默是金”的态度，而另外两人久经折磨，自然已是筋疲力尽。用餐期间只有她独自欢欣鼓舞地说个不停，直到仆役端来咖啡。

“好了，孩子们，”她兴冲冲地说，“你们快去休息一下，用过下午茶我带你们一起去海边兜风。”

乔伊斯先生今天是破例回家吃午饭，饭后自然要回事务所去。

“恐怕我要失陪了，乔伊斯太太，”克罗斯比说，“我必须马上赶回橡胶园。”

“今天就走？”她喊道。

“是的，今天就走。我很久没回去了，有些急事要处理。很感谢您照顾莱斯莉，我们会再作打算的。”

乔伊斯太太想劝他留下来，乔伊斯先生拦住她。

“如果他已经决定了，就随他去吧。天下无不散之筵席。”

她听出了弦外之音，斜了他一眼，不再说话。一阵沉默过后，克罗斯比开口了。

“请您原谅。我现在就动身，好在天黑前赶到。”他站起身，“你能来送送我吗，莱斯莉？”

“当然了。”

他们一起走出餐厅。

“他也太不懂得体贴人了，”乔伊斯太太说，“他难道不知道莱斯莉现在离不开他？”

“如果他能留下来，就一定不会走。相信我。”

“好吧，那我去看看莱斯莉的房间收拾好没有。她绝对需要好好休息，然后好好玩几天。”

乔伊斯太太走出房间，乔伊斯重新坐下。过了一会儿，他听到克罗斯比发动摩托车引擎，车轮轧过花园的碎石小路，骨碌碌地响。他起身走到会客室，克罗斯比太太站在会客室中央，茫然若失，手执一封摊开的信。就是那封密函。他进来的时候，她看了他一眼，脸色死一般的苍白。

“他知道了。”她喃喃道。

乔伊斯先生走到她跟前，把信拿到自己手里，划燃一根火柴，点着那张纸。她看着它一寸一寸地烧掉。火快烧到他手上时，他把它丢到瓷砖地面上，两人看着那张纸卷起来，变黑。他把它踩成灰。

“他知道什么了？”

她久久地凝视着他，双眸带着奇怪的表情。鄙夷还是绝望？乔伊斯先生说不上来。

“他知道了杰夫是我的情人。”

乔伊斯先生惊讶得呆若木鸡。

“我和他在一起很久了。他刚退伍不久我们就开始了。我们知道怎样小心都不为过，我假装讨厌他，罗伯特在的时候他也几乎不上我家来。我常常开车出去与他幽会，每周两三次，罗伯特去新加坡时，他就等仆人就寝之后来找我。我们一直都很好，如胶似漆，心有灵犀。然而最近，大概一年前吧，他开始变得跟从前不一样，我不知道是怎么回事。我无法相信他不再爱我了。他总是说我多心，但我真的受不了了，不断地和他吵架，有时候我想他是厌恶我了。啊，那真是无以言说的痛苦，我伤心得死去活来。我知道他要抛弃我，但我怎么愿意放手！多么痛苦！多么痛苦！我爱他，我把一切毫无保留地交给了他，失去他我活不下去。后来我听说他和一个中国女人同居。我不能相信这是真的，我怎么能够！但终于有一天，我看见了她，亲眼看见她戴着金镯子和金项链在村子里闲逛，那个又老又胖的中国女人！她比我还要老！简直是作孽！那个村里的人都知道她是杰夫的情人。我在她身边经过，她看着我，我知道她知道我也是杰夫的情人。我写信把杰夫叫来，告诉他我必须见他，您也读过那封信。我真是疯了，不知道自己在做什么。我不在乎后果如何，我已经足足十天没见他，那对我来说就像一辈子。最后一次分别时，他把我拥入怀里，吻我，叫我放心，但他头也不回地从我的怀里走进她的怀里。”

她一直在激动地低声说话，说到这里停住了，拧着双手。

“那封可恶的信。我们总是很注意，每次我给他写信，他看完后都会撕碎，怎么想到他偏留下了那一封？他来了，我告诉他我知道那个中国女人的事，但他矢口否认，说那只是流言蜚语。我气得发狂，不知道自己说了些什么。啊，他那个时候是多么面目可憎！我抓他，挠他，我要把他撕得粉碎。我什么都说了，只为了伤害他的自尊心。我侮辱了他，可能还扇了他耳光，他终于生气了。他说我令他感到恶心，他再也不想见到我。他说我把他烦得要命，然后承认了自己与那个中国女人的关系。他说他们两个认识多年，早在战前就已经认识了，只有这个女人才是他的全部，其余的不过是些闲花野草。他说他很高兴，我终于知道了这件事，不会再缠住他。接下来发生了什么，我也不知道。我疯了，我控制不住自己。我抓起枪，扣动了扳机。他大喊一声，我看见他中枪了。他踉跄了几步，逃到游廊上去，我紧跟着他，又开了一枪，他倒下了，我站在他旁边不断扣动扳机，直到枪咔咔作响，我才反应过来子弹已经打光了。”

她终于说完了，气喘吁吁。那张脸不再是人脸，野蛮、愤怒和痛苦把它毁掉了。这位娴静高贵的女士竟然会生出如此邪恶的情感，简直无法想象。她的样子把乔伊斯先生吓得连忙后撤了几步。他看见的不是一张脸，而是一个口齿不清的鬼面具。突然从另一间房间传来一个响亮、亲切又欢快的声音。是乔伊斯太太。

“亲爱的莱斯莉，快来快来，房间准备好了，你肯定困得睁不开眼睛了吧。”

克罗斯比太太的面容慢慢舒缓下来。那些激烈的情绪消失了，仿佛用手抚平一张被揉皱了的纸一样，这张脸重新变得平静淡雅。她的脸色略微有些苍白，双唇却露出甜美可亲的微笑。她又变回那位知书识礼、雍容华贵的太太。

“这就来，亲爱的多萝西。给您添了这么多麻烦，还真是过意不去呢。”

晚会之前


孔祥立　译





斯金纳夫人做事向来守时。现在她已穿戴完毕——身上这件黑色绸料衣服，既与她的年龄相符，又适合为她的女婿服丧，现在她戴上了她的丝绒帽。不过她不太确定戴上它是否合适，因为装饰帽子的白鹭羽毛定会引来一些她将在晚会上碰到的朋友的刻薄劝告。当然，为了这些羽毛而杀掉那些漂亮的白鸟儿，并且是在交配季节，这种事确实令人扼腕。不过，这些羽毛实在是太漂亮、太时尚了，傻子才会拒绝它们，再说，如果她真这样做，肯定会伤害到她女婿的感情，他一路从婆罗洲把它们带来，只希望能讨她欢心。凯思林曾十分厌恶这些羽毛，发生那件事后，她一定希望自己当时没有那样表现。不过，凯思林本就从未真心喜欢过哈罗德。斯金纳夫人站在梳妆台前，将丝绒帽戴在头上，并用一枚有着硕大黑玉圆头的饰针将帽子固定，不管怎样，这是她仅有的一顶漂亮帽子。要是有谁跟她谈起那些鸟儿，她已想好怎么回答了。

“我知道这很不好，”她可以说，“我做梦都不会想买这些东西，但它们是我可怜的女婿上次回家休假时给我带来的。”

那样就能够解释她为何会拥有它们，并为使用它们找到了借口。大家都是善良之人嘛。斯金纳夫人从抽屉里拿出一块干净的手帕，然后在上面喷了点儿古龙水[1]。她从来不用香水，她认为香水太黏稠了，但古龙水却让人神清气爽。现在她已经差不多准备好了。她的目光越过梳妆镜，朝窗外望去。卡农·海伍德为花园晚会挑选了个好日子。天气暖融融的，天空一片蔚蓝，树木尚未褪去春日里的鲜绿。当看见她的小外孙女琼正在房子后面的带状花园里忙着为自己的花坛耙土时，斯金纳夫人不由得笑了。她希望琼的脸色不要那么苍白，让她在热带待那么久，真是个错误，而且就她那个年龄段来讲，她显得太过沉闷了，你从来看不到她跑来跑去，她总是静静地玩自己发明的游戏，或是给花园浇水。斯金纳夫人轻轻拍了拍裙子的前摆，拿起手套，下了楼。

凯思林正坐在靠窗的书桌前，忙着做手里的清单。她是女子高尔夫球俱乐部的名誉秘书长，每当有赛事举办时都有一大堆事情等着她去做。但她已经准备好参加晚会了。

“你最终还是穿了套衫。”斯金纳夫人说。

吃午餐时，她们讨论过凯思林是穿套衫还是黑色雪纺衫的问题。套衫是黑白相间的，凯思林觉得它更时尚一些，但实在不太适合用来服丧，不过米莉森特支持她穿。

“干吗要让我们看上去都像刚参加完葬礼回来似的？”她说，“哈罗德已经死了八个月了。”

在斯金纳夫人看来，说这样的话未免太过绝情。自打从婆罗洲回来后，米莉森特就显得很奇怪。

“你们不会现在就要停戴黑纱了吧，亲爱的？”她问。

米莉森特没有直接回答。

“人们现在穿丧服跟以前不一样了。”她说。而后她稍稍停顿了一下，当她再次开口时，语气让斯金纳夫人觉得非常怪异。显然，凯思林也注意到了这点，因为她也正用奇怪的目光盯着她的姐姐。“我敢肯定，哈罗德也不希望我永远为他穿着丧服。”

“我早穿好了，因为我有些话想跟米莉森特说。”凯思林就母亲的言论做出回答。

“哦？”

凯思林没有解释。不过，她把清单放到一边，皱着眉头重读了一位女士的来信。那位女士在信中投诉俱乐部委员会极不公平地把她应得的让棍数[2]从二十四减到了十八；作为女子高尔夫球俱乐部的名誉秘书长，必须具备相当的智慧。斯金纳夫人开始戴她的新手套。遮阳帘使房间变得凉爽幽暗，她看了一眼那个涂着鲜艳油漆的巨大木制犀鸟——那是哈罗德留给她的，以保佑她一生平安。在她看来，这只犀鸟有些古怪、粗野，但哈罗德很是看重它。这个东西有一定的宗教意义，卡农·海伍德也对它印象极深。沙发上面的墙上，挂着些马来武器，她记不得它们叫什么名字了。茶几上，到处放着一些银器和铜器，都是哈罗德在不同时期送给他们的。她从前一直很喜欢哈罗德，她的眼睛不由自主地开始搜寻起他的那张照片来。照片以前是放在钢琴上的，与她两个女儿、外孙女、姐姐以及外甥的照片放在一起。

“哎呀，凯思林，哈罗德的照片哪里去了？”她问。

凯思林转过头来，照片不见了。

“有人把它拿走了。”凯思林说。

惊讶之余，斯金纳夫人又感到疑惑不解，她起身走到钢琴旁。照片重新整理过了，这样照片之间就没有空隙了。

“或许是米莉森特把它放到自己房间里了。”她说。

“我应该注意到的。再说，米莉森特已经有好几张哈罗德的照片了。她将它们都锁起来了。”

斯金纳夫人觉得奇怪，女儿的房间里竟然没有哈罗德的照片。事实上，有一次她曾提到过这件事，但米莉森特没有回答。自打从婆罗洲回来后，米莉森特就异常沉默，斯金纳夫人本来十分想要安慰一下她的，但看她这个样子，也就不了了之了。米莉森特似乎不愿意谈起自己的巨大不幸。人们表达悲伤的方式千差万别，她丈夫说，最有效的做法就是不要管她。一想到丈夫，斯金纳夫人的心思又回到了即将参加的晚会上。

“你们的父亲问我，是否觉得他应戴个高顶礼帽。”她说，“我说，我觉得为了稳妥起见，还是戴上为好。”

这将是一场盛大的晚宴。他们会吃上博迪糖果店制作的草莓和香草味的冰淇淋。不过，海伍德一家也会提供自制的冰镇咖啡。每个人都会出席。他们已被邀请前去拜见香港主教——他正和卡农一家在一起，他是卡农的老同学，将做关于中国传教活动的演讲。斯金纳夫人的女儿曾在东方待过八年，而她的女婿原先就是婆罗洲某个地区的驻扎官员，所以她对此很感兴趣。当然，跟那些与殖民地之类的事情毫无瓜葛的人相比，这场演讲对她来说有着更多的意义。

“只有英国人才知道的东西他们懂什么呢？”斯金纳先生这样说过。

正在这时，他走进了房间。他是名律师，他父亲以前也是律师，他在林肯营田[3]有自己的办公室。他每天早上前去伦敦，晚上回来。这次他能够陪着妻子和女儿们去参加卡农家的花园晚会，是因为卡农非常巧妙地把晚会时间定在了周六。斯金纳先生身着燕尾服和黑白相间的裤子，看起来神采奕奕。他不是特别讲究穿着，但穿戴非常整洁，看起来像是一名受人尊重的家庭律师，事实也是如此。他的公司从不接手那些不能完全摆上台面的事务。假如一个遇到麻烦的客户找到他，但涉及的事务不那么光彩，他的脸色就会变得非常严峻。

“我觉得，我们是不大乐意接这种案子的，”他说，“你最好到别处问问。”

他抽出便笺，快速写下了一个名字和地址，然后把纸撕下来交给客户。

“假如我是你的话，我想我会去见这些人。只要你提到我的名字，我相信他们一定会竭诚为您服务。”

斯金纳先生脸上的胡子刮得非常干净，他秃顶严重，苍白的薄唇紧紧地抿着，但一双蓝眼睛却尽显羞怯。他的面颊看不到血色，脸上布满皱纹。

“你穿上新裤子了。”斯金纳夫人说。

“我觉得这个场合挺合适的，”他回答，“我在想，我是不是应该在翻领上别枝花呀。”

“我反正不会那样做，爸爸，”凯思林说，“我认为那个样子不好看。”

“很多人都会戴的。”斯金纳夫人说道。

“只有办事员那类人才会戴，”凯思林说，“海伍德一家宴请了所有人，你知道的。再说，我们还在服丧啊。”

“不知道主教演讲后会不会要求捐款。”斯金纳说。

“我觉得应该不会。”斯金纳夫人回答。

“我觉得这样做的话就太差劲了。”凯思林发表看法道。

“还是以防万一为好，”斯金纳先生说，“到时候，我就代表全家捐款了，不知道十个先令够不够，还是我必须捐一英镑啊。”

“假如你要捐款，我想你应该捐一英镑，爸爸。”凯思林说。

“到时我会视情况而定的。我不能比别人给得少，但另一方面，也没有理由多给。”

凯思林把她的文件放进写字台的抽屉里，然后站起身。她看了看腕表。

“米莉森特准备好了吗？”斯金纳夫人问。

“还有的是时间。我们约的是四点，我认为我们四点半之前不用到的。我告诉了戴维斯，让他四点十五左右把车开过来。”

通常都是凯思林开车，但像今天这样的重大场合，园丁戴维斯就会穿上制服充当司机。这样当车开到门口时，也会更加体面一些。并且凯思林穿上了新套衫，自然是不太想开车的。看到母亲正一根手指一根手指地费力戴着手套，她想到自己也需要戴上。她闻了闻手套，看是否还有肥皂的气味残留在上面。还好，味很淡，她想不会有人注意。

门终于打开了，米莉森特走了进来。她戴着寡妇用的黑纱。斯金纳夫人一直没能适应它们，但她当然知道米莉森特必须整整一年都戴着它们。很遗憾，黑纱并不适合她，它只适合一些人。她曾试戴过一次米莉森特的帽子，还有配套的白带子、长面纱，她自觉看上去很不错。她当然希望亲爱的阿尔弗雷德比自己活得更长久，但如果他不能，她将永远为他戴着黑纱。维多利亚女王的黑纱就从未摘下过。但米莉森特不一样，她要年轻得多，她只有三十六岁——三十六岁就做寡妇真是太不幸了，而且她再婚的可能性并不大。凯思林现在还不大可能结婚，虽然她已经三十五岁了。上次米莉森特和哈罗德回来时，她曾提议让凯思林去跟他们一起住，哈罗德倒是非常愿意，但米莉森特却说不能这样。斯金纳夫人不知道为什么不能，那原本能给凯思林一个机会。当然，他们并不是想摆脱她，但女孩子终究是要嫁人的，问题是，他们在国内所熟知的男人都已经结婚了。米莉森特解释说，是因为天气太糟糕了。的确，她的肤色变得很差，现在已经没人认为米莉森特是两姐妹中更漂亮的那一个了。随着年龄的增长，凯思林长得越发精致，当然也有人说她太瘦，但现在她剪短了头发，再加上不管刮风下雨坚持打高尔夫球，她的脸颊已经逐渐红润了起来，斯金纳夫人认为她现在很漂亮，但没人能够这样说可怜的米莉森特。她的身材整个走了形，本来个子就不高，现在又发起福来，看上去一副矮胖粗壮的样子。她实在太胖了，斯金纳夫人认为这是由于热带的高温让她无法进行锻炼。她的皮肤灰黄，像泥土一样，而那一双蓝眼睛，曾经是她脸上最好看的地方，如今也变得黯淡无光了。

“她应该处理一下她的脖子，”斯金纳夫人心想，“她现在的双下巴太可怕了！”

她曾跟丈夫提起过一两次，他说米莉森特也不年轻了，话是没错，但她也不能破罐子破摔呀。斯金纳夫人决定跟她的女儿好好谈谈，但她当然必须尊重女儿的不幸，她可以等一年结束后再说。她很高兴能够找到这个理由推迟跟女儿的谈话，一想到这件事她就有点儿紧张。因为米莉森特肯定是变了，她脸上的阴郁让她的母亲感到陌生。斯金纳夫人总是喜欢不过脑子就把心中所想大声讲出来，但当你说话时（只是随便说说，你知道），米莉森特总是不予搭理，这让人感到尴尬，因为你根本不知道她有没有在听。有时候，斯金纳夫人会因此恼羞成怒，但为了不冲米莉森特发火，她不得不提醒自己可怜的哈罗德才刚刚死了八个月。

寡妇正默不作声地向前走，阳光透过窗户照进来，打在了她那张肥厚的脸庞上，而凯思林是背光站着的，她已经注视了她姐姐好一会儿了。

“米莉森特，我想跟你说件事，”她说，“今天早上我跟格拉迪斯·海伍德一起打高尔夫球了。”

“你打败她了？”米莉森特问。

格拉迪斯·海伍德是卡农家唯一未嫁的女儿。

“她跟我说了一件与你有关的事，我认为你应该要知道。”

米莉森特的目光从她妹妹身上转移开，投向了正在花园里浇花的小女孩。

“你有告诉安妮把琼放在厨房的茶端给她吗，妈妈？”她问。

“已经告诉她了，仆人喝茶时她就会喝。”凯思林冷冷地看着她。

“主教回家路上在新加坡待了两三天，”凯思林继续说道，“他很喜欢旅行，去过婆罗洲。他认识很多你认识的人。”

“他很有兴致见见你，亲爱的，”斯金纳夫人说，“他认识可怜的哈罗德吗？”

“是的，他在瓜拉索洛见过他，对他印象深刻。他说当他听到他的死讯时，非常震惊。”

米莉森特坐下来，开始戴她那双黑色的手套。让斯金纳夫人感到奇怪的是，听到这些话后，她居然一言不发。

“哦，米莉森特，”她说，“哈罗德的照片不见了，是你拿了吗？”

“是的，我把它拿走了。”

“我就想着应该是你拿走的。”

米莉森特再次陷入了沉默，这真是一个气死人的臭毛病。

凯思林稍稍转了下身，以便能正对着她的姐姐。

“米莉森特，你为什么跟我们说哈罗德死于热病？”

寡妇纹丝不动，她直直地看着凯思林，土黄色的皮肤因为泛红而暗淡下来。她没有回答。

“你这话什么意思，凯思林？”斯金纳夫人惊讶地问。

“主教说，哈罗德是自杀的。”

斯金纳夫人惊讶地大叫起来，但她丈夫伸了伸手，示意她不要激动。

“是真的吗，米莉森特？”

“是真的。”

“那你为何不告诉我们？”

米莉森特停顿了片刻，她用手指漫不经心地拨弄着一个放在身侧桌子上的文莱铜器。那也是一份来自哈罗德的礼物。

“我觉得让琼以为她的父亲死于热病会更好些。我不想让她知道任何有关这件事的情况。”

“你让我们陷入了一种极度尴尬的境况，”凯思林微微皱了皱眉头，“格拉迪斯·海伍德说，她觉得我很不厚道，因为我没告诉她真相。我很难让她相信我对这件事一无所知。她说她父亲也很不高兴，他说我们认识这么多年了，想想还是他给你们主持的婚礼，大家关系如此融洽，他认为我们应该相信他。无论如何，即使我们不想告诉他真相，那也不应该骗他。”

“我得说，在这点上我跟他观点一致。”斯金纳先生不悦道。

“当然，我告诉格拉迪斯，这也不怨我们。我们只是把你的话转告给他们了。”

“但愿没有因此耽误你们的那场高尔夫球赛。”米莉森特说。

“说真的，亲爱的，我认为你这种说法太不恰当了。”她的父亲大声说道。

他从椅子上站起来，走到空空的壁炉边。出于习惯，他把燕尾分开了站在壁炉前。

“这是我的私事，”米莉森特答道，“如果我不想说出去，我不知道有什么理由非说不可。”

“如果连你的母亲你都不告诉，你对她还有什么感情可言？”斯金纳夫人道。

米莉森特耸了耸肩。

“你早该知道这种事迟早会曝光的。”凯思林说。

“我怎么可能知道？我没料到那两个喜欢传播流言蜚语的老神父除了议论我之外竟然无事可谈。”

“当时主教提到他去过婆罗洲，海伍德一家自然而然就会问他认不认识哈罗德了。”

“这些都不是重点，”斯金纳先生说，“我觉得你理应把真实的情况告诉我们，那样我们才能决定怎样做最好。作为一名律师，我可以告诉你，如果你想掩盖真相，从长远看只能让事情变得更糟。”

“可怜的哈罗德，”斯金纳夫人说着，泪水缓缓地从她涂满脂粉的脸颊上滑落，“真是太可怕了！他一直都是我的好女婿。到底是什么原因让他做出这种可怕的事？”

“是气候。”

“我想你最好把全部的真实情况都告诉我们，米莉森特。”父亲说。

“凯思林会跟你们说的。”

凯思林犹豫了。她要说的的确太可怕了，这种让人恐惧的事情似乎不应该发生在他们这样的家庭。

“主教说他是割喉自杀的。”

斯金纳夫人的呼吸变得急促起来，冲动之下她走到了丧失亲人的女儿身边。她想把她搂进怀里。

“我可怜的孩子。”她呜咽道。

但米莉森特缩了回去。

“不要来烦我，妈妈。我真的受不了这种搂搂抱抱。”

“你也真是的，米莉森特。”斯金纳先生皱了皱眉，说道。

他一直觉得她的举止不太像话。

斯金纳夫人小心翼翼地用手帕擦了擦眼，摇头叹气地坐回到椅子上。凯思林玩弄着脖子上的长项链。

“让一个朋友来告诉我姐夫死亡的细节，还有比这更荒唐的事吗？这件事让我们看起来像傻瓜一样。主教非常希望见见你，米莉森特。他想告诉你他对你有多么同情。”她停顿了一下，但米莉森特没有开口，“他说米莉森特带着琼出去了，当她回来时，发现可怜的哈罗德已经死在了床上。”

“那打击一定很大。”斯金纳先生说。

斯金纳夫人又开始哭了，凯思林轻轻地把手放在她肩上。

“别哭了，妈妈，”她说，“你的眼睛会哭红的，那会让人笑话的。”

他们都沉默下来。斯金纳夫人擦干了眼泪，努力控制住了自己。在这一刻，她的羽绒帽上还戴着可怜的哈罗德送给她的白鹭羽毛，这让她觉得非常奇怪。

“我还有话要告诉你。”凯思林说道。

米莉森特再次不慌不忙地看向她的妹妹，她的目光很沉着，但充满了警惕，神情像极了一个人在等待着一种响声，唯恐错过似的。

“我不想说任何伤害你的话，亲爱的，”凯思林继续说道，“但是还有些事情，我觉得你应该要知道。主教说，哈罗德喝醉了酒。”

“哦，亲爱的，太可怕了！”斯金纳夫人叫道，“这话说得太令人震惊了！是格拉迪斯·海伍德告诉你的吗？你怎么回答的？”

“我说那完全是胡说八道。”

“这都是掩盖真相造成的。”斯金纳先生气愤道，“事情总是如此。你越是想保守秘密，各种流言就越是会满天飞，那些往往要比真相糟糕得多。”

“在新加坡时，有人告诉主教，哈罗德是在震颤性谵妄发作时自杀的。我想，为了我们全家考虑，你应该否认这件事，米莉森特。”

“如此议论一个已经去世的人，真是件可怕的事，”斯金纳夫人说，“等琼长大了，对她来说这将是件十分糟糕的事！”

“不过这个说法有什么依据吗，米莉森特？”她父亲问，“哈罗德一向很节制的。”

“这个嘛。”寡妇回答。

“他喝酒吗？”

“简直就是暴饮，像鱼一样。”

这个回答如此出人意料，讥讽的语气如此强烈，让三个人都吓了一跳。

“米莉森特，你怎么可以这样说自己已经去世的丈夫？”她母亲大声叫道，两只整齐的戴着手套的手紧攥着，“我真的无法理解你。自从回来以后，你就一直很怪异。我根本无法相信，我的女儿，竟然会这样对待自己丈夫的死。”

“先别说这个了，孩子他妈。”斯金纳先生说，“这事儿我们可以以后再细说。”

他走到窗前，望着那个洒满阳光的小花园，然后又走回房间。他从口袋里掏出夹鼻眼镜，尽管没有戴上的打算，但还是用手帕擦了擦。米莉森特看了父亲一眼，眼神里尽是愤世嫉俗的嘲讽。斯金纳先生十分气恼，他已经完成了一周的工作，在下周一早晨之前，他都是个自由人。尽管他跟妻子说，这个花园晚会真是个麻烦事，他宁愿在自家的花园里静静地喝会儿茶，但他还是很期待这场晚会的。他对中国的传教活动不怎么在意，但倒是颇有兴致跟主教见上一面。唉，现在却发生了这档子事！他真不愿让自己牵扯到这类事情中。再说，突如其来地被人告知女婿是个酒鬼，还自杀了，这太叫人不快了！米莉森特若有所思地按压着白色的袖口，以使它变得平滑一些。她的冷淡神情激怒了他，但他没跟她说话，而是转向了小女儿。

“你怎么不坐下，凯思林？房间里有的是椅子。”

凯思林拉过一把椅子，一声不吭地坐了下来。斯金纳先生走到米莉森特面前，面对着她。

“我当然明白你为什么跟我们说哈罗德死于热病。我认为这个做法是错误的，因为这类事情根本掩盖不住。我不知道主教告诉海伍德一家的情况跟事实有多大出入，但是如果你愿意听从我的劝告的话，你就应该将一切尽可能详细地告诉我们，然后我们再看看该如何处理。既然现在卡农·海伍德和格拉迪斯已经知道了这个事情，我们也就别指望能够就此打住了。在这种地方，这样的事必定会传出去。不管怎样，如果我们了解了真相，处理起来就会方便很多。”

斯金纳夫人和凯思林觉得他把话说得够清楚了，便等着米莉森特的回答。米莉森特面无表情地听父亲讲完，脸上突然出现的那道红晕消失了，脸色又变得像往常一样苍白、灰黄。

“我觉得如果我把真相告诉你们，你们可能会不大乐意听。”

“你必须知道，你完全可以相信我们是同情和理解你的。”凯思林郑重说道。

米莉森特扫了她一眼，紧闭的嘴角上闪过了一丝微笑。她缓缓地看向他们三个。斯金纳夫人心里有些不安：她看着他们，就像看着服装公司的人体模特一样，她仿佛生活在另一个不同的世界里，跟他们毫无瓜葛。

“你们知道，我跟哈罗德结婚时，我并不爱他。”她若有所思地说道。

斯金纳夫人正要发出惊叫，她的丈夫迅速做出一个手势，制止了她——这个手势微乎其微，但多年来的婚姻生活，已经赋予了这个手势举足轻重的意义。米莉森特继续说了下去，声音非常平缓，几乎没有任何语气变化。

“我当时二十七岁了，似乎也没有其他人愿意娶我。他那时四十四岁，看起来还要更老一些，但他有一份非常不错的工作，不是吗？我不可能有更好的机会了。”

斯金纳夫人又差点儿哭出来，但她想起来还有场晚会等着她。

“我现在算是明白你为什么要把他的照片拿走了。”她悲痛地说道。

“不要说话，妈妈。”凯思林大叫道。

照片是哈罗德跟米莉森特订婚时拍的，哈罗德照得非常不错。斯金纳夫人一直觉得他是个很好的人。他体格健壮，身材高大，或许有点儿太胖了，但他保养得很好，风度非凡。他那时已显露出秃顶的迹象，不过现在的男人秃顶都很早，他说那些遮阳帽、太阳帽之类的东西，都对头发非常不好。他有一撮小黑胡子，面庞被太阳晒成了深褐色。当然，他脸上最好的地方是他的眼睛——棕色的大眼睛，跟琼的一模一样。他谈笑风生，凯思林说他那是夸夸其谈，但斯金纳夫人并不这么认为，她觉得一个男人说点儿大话没什么大不了。尤其是当她发现——她很快就发现了——他被米莉森特迷住时，她便开始非常喜欢他。他对斯金纳夫人殷勤备至，他给她讲他住的那个地方的情形，讲他杀死的大猎物，她似乎真的听得兴致盎然。凯思林说他自我感觉过于良好，但斯金纳夫人她们那代人完全接受这种男人应该自负一点儿的观念。米莉森特很快也看出了苗头，尽管她没跟母亲提及，但她的母亲知道，如果哈罗德向她求婚的话，她会答应的。

哈罗德跟一些已经在婆罗洲待了三十年的人住在一起，他们都对这个国家赞不绝口。一个女人住到那里应该也会感到舒适的。当然，孩子们到了七岁还是要回到国内的，但斯金纳夫人认为没必要非得那样。她请哈罗德到家里来吃饭，告诉他他们总喜欢在家里喝茶。他当时似乎也正闲得没事可做，当他对老朋友的拜访结束之时，她告诉他，如果他能前来跟他们一起住上两周，他们将非常高兴。正是在这两周即将结束之时，哈罗德和米莉森特订了婚。他们举行了一个非常漂亮的婚礼，然后前往威尼斯度了蜜月。蜜月结束后，两人才坐船去东方。每当轮船停靠到不同的港口时，米莉森特都会给家里写信。她看起来非常快乐。

“在瓜拉索洛，人们对我非常好。”她说。瓜拉索洛是塞姆布鲁州的中心城市。“我们跟驻外代表住在一起，每个人都邀请我们去吃饭。有一两次，我听说有人请哈罗德去喝酒，但是他拒绝了。他说他已经翻开了人生的新篇章，他现在是已婚人士了。我不知道为什么他们都笑了。格雷夫人，就是驻外代表的妻子，她告诉我说，哈罗德结婚了他们都很高兴，她说驻扎地的单身汉们都太孤独了。当我们离开瓜拉索洛时，格雷夫人跟我们告别的方式很是古怪，让我备感惊讶，就好像她郑重其事地把哈罗德交由我来照管了。”

三个人都一声不响地听她说着。凯思林一直没有把视线从她姐姐那张冷漠的脸上移开，而斯金纳先生则直直地盯着他身前的那些马来武器——克力士短剑[4]和帕兰刀[5]，它们就悬挂在他妻子所坐的沙发之上的墙面上。

“直到一年半后我又回到瓜拉索洛时，我才明白他们的举止为何如此怪异。”米莉森特的喉咙里发出一种细微的奇怪声音，就像是一种嘲笑的回声，“我还知道了许多之前我并不知道的事情。哈罗德那时是为了结婚才回英国的，至于跟谁结婚他倒不是很在意。你们还记得我们当时是多么兴师动众地接待他吗，妈妈？其实根本没必要那么麻烦的。”

“我不懂你是什么意思，米莉森特。”斯金纳夫人说道，语气不无刻薄，因为这种含沙射影式的讽刺让她感到不悦，“我看他是真的为你着迷。”

米莉森特耸了耸她那肥厚的肩膀。

“他是个十足的酒鬼，以前每晚都是抱着一瓶威士忌入睡，到第二天早上酒瓶就干了。政务司司长告诉他，如果他再不戒酒，他就得辞职了，他说他再给他一次机会。他可以让他请假回国，他还建议他结婚，这样他回来后就有人照料了。哈罗德跟我结婚，是因为他需要一个监护人。他们在瓜拉索洛打赌，看我能让他保持多长时间的清醒。”

“但是他爱你呀。”斯金纳夫人打断了她的话，“你不知道，他过去都是怎样跟我谈论你的。就在你刚刚所说的那段时间里，你回瓜拉索洛生孩子了，他给我写了一封感人肺腑的信，全是关于你的。”

米莉森特又看了一眼她的母亲，她灰黄的皮肤暗淡了下来，放在膝盖上的双手微微颤抖起来。她想起了婚后头几个月的日子。官方的汽艇将他们送到河口，他们在那里的小木屋里度过了一个夜晚。哈罗德开玩笑说，这是他们的海滨豪宅。第二天，他们坐着一艘普拉胡帆船沿河逆流而上。由于受以前所读小说的影响，她以为婆罗洲的河流都是漆黑一片，异常凶险的，但事实上那儿的天空是蔚蓝的，上面还点缀着几朵小小的白云，红树林和尼帕林里的绿草被流水冲洗过后，在阳光下闪闪发光；河的两侧是成片的没有任何小道的灌木丛，远处的天空映衬出一座座蜿蜒起伏的山峦的轮廓。清晨的清新空气令人身心愉悦。她就像来到了一片友好富庶的土地，拥有了无边的自由。他们的目光在河岸上搜寻着，看是否有猴子蹲伏在枝叶缠绕的树丛中。一次，哈罗德指着一块像是木头的东西，告诉她那是一条鳄鱼。戴着遮阳帽，穿着帆布裤子的代表助理，正站在浮动码头上迎接他们，十二个年轻士兵齐刷刷地向他们列队致意。他们向她介绍了代表助理，他的名字叫辛普森。

“啊，先生，”他对哈罗德说，“看到你回来，我真是太高兴了。你不在的晚上简直太冷清了！”

驻外代表的平房，就坐落在一座低矮的山头上，周围是一片花园，园里各式各样的鲜艳花朵竞相开放。平房有点儿破旧了，家具稀稀拉拉的没有几件，但屋子很是凉爽，而且很宽敞。

“村庄就在那下面。”哈罗德说道，并用手指了指。

她的视线跟随着他的手势移动。这时，一阵锣响从那片椰子林中传来，在她心里激起了一丝奇异的感觉。

尽管她每天都没什么事可做，但这样的日子过得相当轻松。黎明时分，一个男仆会给他们端来茶水。然后，他们会到游廊漫步，呼吸清晨芳香的空气（哈罗德穿着汗衫和纱笼[6]；米莉森特穿着睡衣），直到更衣去吃早饭。饭毕，哈罗德会到自己的办公室去，她会花一两个小时来学习马来语。午饭后，当她午休时，他又会回到办公室去。下午，他们会喝上杯茶，这样就能精神焕发了，然后出去散步，或者在九洞球场上打打高尔夫——球场是哈罗德将平房下面的一片丛林清除后，整出一块平地修建的。晚上六点，辛普森先生会过来跟他们喝上一杯。他们会一直聊到晚些时候的用餐时间。有时，哈罗德和辛普森先生也会下下象棋。香雾缭绕的夜晚最是迷人。萤火虫把游廊下的灌木丛变成了闪烁着冷光的、颤巍巍的灯塔，繁花盛开的树木在空气中散发着香甜的气味。晚饭后，两人会读读六周前从伦敦寄来的报纸，然后很快便上床休息。米莉森特很享受作为已婚妇女的生活，她有一套属于自己的房子，她也很满意穿着纱笼的当地仆人，他们赤着脚在平房里四处走动，十分安静但也非常友好。驻扎官员妻子的身份让她觉得自己很重要，她为此感到快乐。哈罗德说着流利的当地语言，发号施令的样子和身上透出的威严都让她印象深刻。她偶尔会到法庭去听他审理案件。他职责繁多，能力出众，让她肃然起敬。辛普森先生告诉她，哈罗德对本地居民的了解不亚于这个国家的任何人，坚定、机智和良好的幽默感在他身上融合一气，这些特质用以对付那些胆小怕事、报复心强、天性多疑的本地民族，很是受用。米莉森特开始对她的丈夫心生某种崇拜之感。

在他们结婚近一年时，有两名英国博物学家在回国途中来到他们这里，跟他们一块儿住了几天。他们带着总督亲笔书写的推荐信，言辞恳切，哈罗德说很荣幸能为他们效劳。他们的到来给他们的生活带来了令人愉快的变化。米莉森特邀请辛普森先生前来吃饭（他住在“要塞”，只有周日晚上才能跟他们共进晚餐）。晚饭后，男人们坐下来打桥牌，米莉森特很快便离开他们，上床睡觉了。但他们太吵了，导致她很长时间都无法入睡。不知什么时候，哈罗德晃晃悠悠地进了房间，她被惊醒了，但没有说话。他决定洗个澡再睡，洗浴间就在他们房间的楼下。他走下楼梯时显然滑了一跤，因为她听到了一声巨响，接着他便开始咒骂。随后，他剧烈地呕吐起来，她听到他接二连三地往自己身上浇了数桶水。过了一会儿，他回来了，这次走得非常小心。他爬上楼梯，悄悄地溜上了床。米莉森特假装睡着了，心中泛起一阵厌恶之感：哈罗德喝醉了。她决定第二天早上再谈这件事，博物学家会怎么看他呢？但第二天一早，他又恢复了以往的体面尊贵，这让她下不了决心提及那个话题。八点，哈罗德和她同两位客人一起，坐下来吃早餐。哈罗德打量了一下餐桌。

“麦片粥，”他说，“米莉森特，客人们的早饭应该来点儿伍斯特沙司，我觉得别的他们可能不想吃。至于我嘛，来点儿威士忌苏打，就心满意足了。”

博物学家们笑了，但一脸羞愧的表情。

“你丈夫太可怕了。”其中一人说。

“你们初来乍到，如果我头天晚上就让你们头脑清醒地上床睡觉，那我真是没有尽到殷勤待客的职责。”哈罗德以他圆熟而郑重的说话方式说道。

米莉森特不悦地笑了笑，不由得松了一口气，看来客人们跟丈夫一样喝醉了。第二天晚上，她跟他们在一起，没有离开，聚会在一个合适的时间结束了。当客人们重新踏上了旅程时，她感到开心。他们的生活又恢复了平静。几个月后，哈罗德去视察他的管辖区，回来时染上了疟疾。这种疾病她以前听说的多了，但还是第一次亲眼见到。病愈后，哈罗德身体变得非常虚弱，但她并未觉得奇怪。不过她发现他的举止变得有些古怪。从办公室回来，他总是瞪大眼睛盯着她。他站在游廊上，就英国的政治形势，喋喋不休地发表长篇大论时，身体总是微微摇晃着，但仍保持着那份高贵。有时说着说着思路就断了，这时他会用淘气的眼神看着她，但他天生的庄重让她对这种淘气心生不安，他说：

“真是把人折腾得够呛啊，这讨人厌的疟疾。啊，老婆，你不知道，一个男人要成为帝国的建造者，将承担多少压力。”

她觉得辛普森先生开始显得有些焦虑，有一两次当他们独处时，似乎有什么话已到了他的嘴边，但由于羞怯，他最终没有说出口。这种感觉越来越强烈，已经让她紧张了起来。一天晚上，哈罗德不知何故待在办公室的时间比平时更久了些，还没回来。于是，她揪住了他。

“你究竟有什么话要跟我说，辛普森先生？”她突然大叫道。

他顿时红了脸，一副犹豫不定的样子。

“没什么要说的。你怎么会认为我有什么特别的话要跟你说？”

辛普森先生是个二十四岁的年轻人，人很瘦弱，本来有一头好看的鬈发，但他却煞费苦心地用发蜡弄平了它们。他腰部肿胀，留有蚊子叮咬过的伤疤。米莉森特直直地盯着他。

“如果这事与哈罗德有关，你难道不认为坦白跟我讲会更好些吗？”

现在他的脸变得更红了。他坐在藤条椅上不安地推诿着，她则一再坚持。

“恐怕你会觉得这事糟糕极了，”他终于开了口，“在背后说上司坏话的我真是糟糕极了。疟疾很可怕，人一旦得过一回，整个人都会变得不堪一击。”

他又变得犹犹豫豫，嘴角向下耷拉着，似乎快要哭出来了。在米莉森特眼中，他看起来就像个小男孩。

“我会守口如瓶的，”她微笑着说，竭力掩饰住自己的担忧，“告诉我吧。”

“我觉得很遗憾，你丈夫在办公室留有一瓶威士忌。这样他就常常能比平时多喝上几口。”

辛普森先生因为激动嗓音变得沙哑，米莉森特顿时感觉到一股冷意传遍了全身，但她控制住了自己，因为她知道，如果想让这个年轻人说出一切，她就不能把他吓住。他不愿说，她就给他施压，哄骗他，勾起他的责任感，最后，她哭了起来。于是，他向她全盘托出了，他说在过去的两周里，哈罗德多多少少都处于醉酒状态，当地人都在谈论这事。他们说，很快他就将变得像婚前一样糟糕了。那时的他终日酗酒成性。关于当时的细节，虽然她已经想尽一切办法，但辛普森先生还是绝口不提。

“你认为他现在正在喝酒吗？”她问。

“我不知道。”

米莉森特突然感到了强烈的羞辱和愤怒。法院就设在“要塞”，之所以叫这个名字，是因为它是枪支弹药的存放地。它就坐落在平房对面的花园里。太阳就快落下去了，她无须戴帽。她站起来向那边走去。她看到哈罗德正坐在一个大厅后面的办公室里——这是他处理司法案件的地方——前面放着一瓶威士忌。他抽着烟，正在跟三四个马来人交谈。他们就站在他的面前，满脸谄媚地听他讲话，同时还带着轻蔑的微笑。而他则满脸通红。

当地人一下子都走了。

“我来看看你在做什么。”她说。

因为他一直都以礼待她，所以他站了起来，但趔趄了一下。他感觉自己无法站稳，但仍尽力使自己的行为显得庄重一些。

“坐吧，亲爱的，坐吧。工作太多了，我实在是抽不开身。”

她气愤地看着他。

“你喝醉了。”她说。

他凝视着她，眼睛微微凸起，肥大的脸上渐渐浮现出一副傲慢的神情。

“我根本不明白你的意思。”他说。

她本来准备好了一大串愤怒的劝告，但突然间她就号啕大哭起来。然后，她坐到椅子上，双手捂住了脸。哈罗德看了她一会儿，泪水也顺着他的脸颊汩汩流了下来。他张开双臂来到她面前，扑通一声沉重地跪在地上，啜泣着将她搂入怀中。

“原谅我，原谅我吧，”他说，“我向你保证，这种事再也不会发生了。都怪那该死的疟疾！”

“真是太丢脸了！”她悲叹道。

他像个孩子般哭泣着。这个高大、尊贵的男人所表现出的自卑有些让人动容。不久，米莉森特抬起头来，他正用恳求、悔恨的目光看着她。

“你能向我发誓再也不沾酒了吗？”

“我发誓，我发誓。我痛恨它。”

正是那个时候，她告诉了他，她有身孕了。他陷入狂喜之中。

“这正是我唯一想要的，我会因此成为一个真正的人。”

他们回到了平房。哈罗德洗了个澡，稍睡了会儿。晚饭后，他们心平气和地谈了很久。他承认，在他们结婚前，他一直时不时地饮酒过量——在偏远的驻扎地很容易养成这种恶习。米莉森特提出的每一个要求他都同意了。在米莉森特前去瓜拉索洛分娩前的那几个月，哈罗德扮演了一个优秀丈夫的角色，温柔体贴，充满自豪，深情款款，无可挑剔。一艘汽艇前来接米莉森特，她将离开哈罗德六周时间。他诚心诚意地承诺，在她不在的日子里，绝对滴酒不沾。他把手放在她肩上。

“我从不食言，”他庄重地说道，“即使没有这个承诺，你想你在遭那么大的罪，我还能增加你的痛苦吗？”

琼出生了。米莉森特住在驻外代表家里。驻外代表的妻子是个和善的中年女子，待她非常友好。在两人单独相处的漫长时间里，她们几乎无事可做，只有通过聊天来打发时间。也正是在这段时间里，她渐渐透悉了丈夫过去的酗酒史。对她来说最难接受的事实是，当时哈罗德被告知要保住自己位置的唯一条件就是带回一个妻子，这让她气愤、怨恨不已。当她意识到他过去是一个不可救药的酒鬼时，她隐隐感到不安。她惊恐地想到，在她不在家的这段时间里，他不可能抵御住酒瘾的。她带着孩子和保姆回了家。她在河口待了一个晚上，让一名信使坐上轻舟去通知丈夫。汽艇到达后，她焦虑地扫视了一下码头，看到哈罗德和辛普森先生正站在那里，年轻的士兵整齐地列队站着。她的心沉重异常，因为她看到哈罗德的身子在轻微地摇晃着，像是一个正站在行驶的船上，努力保持着平衡的人。她知道他又醉了。

这不是一次令人愉快的回家。她几乎忘记了母亲、父亲和妹妹正静静地听着。现在她终于清醒过来，意识到了他们的存在。她说的那些似乎太遥远了。

“那时我知道我痛恨他，”她说，“我都想杀死他。”

“哦，米莉森特，不要那样说，”她母亲叫道，“别忘了，他人已经死了，可怜的人哪！”

米莉森特看了看母亲，片刻后，愤怒使她那张漠然的脸阴沉下来。斯金纳先生不安地走动着。

“继续说。”凯思林道。

“当他发现我已了解到了一切后，他反而释然了。三个月后，他的震颤性谵妄又发作了一次。”

“那你怎么不离开他？”凯思林问。

“那样做有什么好处？要是那样做，两周之内他就会被解雇。谁来养我和琼？我必须留下来。当他清醒时，我没什么抱怨的。他根本不爱我，但他喜欢我；我跟他结婚也不是因为我爱他，只是因为我需要结婚了。我尽了最大努力不让他沾酒，还设法让格雷先生下令禁止从瓜拉索洛运威士忌过来，但他能从中国人手里买到。我监视着他就像猫监视老鼠一样。但他太狡猾了，不久又发作了一次。对于工作他开始玩忽职守，我担心会遭到投诉。我们离开瓜拉索洛两天，以便进行治疗，但我想这时有了些风言风语，因为格雷先生给我发来一封私人告诫信。我给哈罗德看了，他怒骂、咆哮起来，但我看出他有些害怕。在接下来的两三个月里，他没有再喝醉，不过随之又旧病复发了。这样反反复复，直到我们离开那里。

“在我们到这里停留之前，我苦苦恳求他小心，我不想让你们任何人知道我嫁给了一个什么样的男人。在英国停留期间，他的表现一切正常，在我们乘船离开前，我又警告了他。他越来越喜欢琼，并为她感到自豪，琼也对他很依恋，她喜欢他更甚于喜欢我。我问他是不是想让孩子长大后，知道他是个醉鬼，我终于找到了控制他的方法。这个想法让他感到害怕。我告诉他，我不允许这件事情再次发生了，倘若他让琼看到他喝醉了，我马上带她走。你们知道吗？当我说这话时，他的脸一下子变得惨白。那天晚上，我跪下来感谢上帝，因为我找到了拯救自己丈夫的办法。”

“他说如果我支持他，他将再试一次，我们决定一起战斗。他做出了艰辛的努力，当他觉得‘必须’得喝点儿的时候，他就来找我。你们知道，他这个人往往喜欢炫耀，但在我面前，他非常谦和，像个孩子一样，他需要依靠我。或许结婚时他不爱我，但这个时候，他是爱我的，也爱琼。过去我恨他，因为那份耻辱，因为他喝醉了酒还故作尊贵威严，让人憎恶，但现在我内心里面产生了一种奇特的情感——它不是爱，而是一种奇异而羞涩的柔情。他不只是我的丈夫了，他还像个孩子，在那些漫长而艰难的日子里，被我揣在心里。他为我感到骄傲，我也感到自豪。他说话时的长篇大论不再让我心烦，而他一本正经的说话方式让我觉得滑稽而迷人。最后我们胜利了——有两年的时间，他再没喝过一滴酒，而且酒瘾一点儿都没了，他甚至能对此开开玩笑。

“辛普森先生那时已经走了，我们又有了一个年轻人，叫弗朗西斯。

“‘我是个改造好的酒鬼，弗朗西斯。’哈罗德有一次跟他说，‘如果不是因为我的妻子，我早就被开除了。我有个全世界最好的妻子，弗朗西斯。’

“你们不知道听到他说那样的话，对我来说意味着什么。我觉得我过去经历的一切都是值得的，我感到如此快乐。”

她沉默下来——她想起了那条宽阔、浑浊的黄色河流，在它的两岸她生活了如此之久。那些白鹭，羽毛洁白，在悠悠夕阳中闪烁着光泽，沿着溪流成群地飞下来，那样低、那样迅速，飞着飞着便散开了。它们像是雪白的音符激起的涟漪，甜美、纯粹，如春天一般，被一只无形的手演奏着，又如无形的竖琴上弹出的琴音。它们在绿色的河堤之间飞旋，裹着傍晚时的暗影，像知足的头脑里快乐的思绪。

“这时琼病倒了，有三个星期我们都处于焦虑之中。比瓜拉索洛更近的地方没有一名医生，我们只好将就着让本地的一名药剂师进行诊治。等她痊愈后，我带她去了河口，以便能让她呼吸些新鲜的海滨空气。我们在那里待了一周。自从生孩子以后，这还是我第一次和哈罗德分别。那里有一个渔村，房子都建在木桩之上，离我们并不远，但几乎没人过来打扰我们。我非常思念哈罗德，柔情充溢了整个心胸，我突然明白，我是爱他的。当普拉胡帆船来接我们回去时，我是如此开心，因为我要去把这件事告诉他，我想这对他有着重要的意义。我没法告诉你们那时我有多快乐。在我们坐船逆流而上时，船长告诉我，弗朗西斯先生去内地抓捕一个弑夫的女人去了，他已经走了几天。

“让我感到惊讶的是，哈罗德没有在码头接我。他一向对这类事情非常在意，他过去常说夫妻之间应该相敬如宾，我想不出有什么事让他不能前来。我爬上了平房所在的小山丘。女仆在后面抱着琼。平房里异常安静。周围似乎也没有仆人，我不明白是怎么回事。我想是不是哈罗德没料到我会回来这么早，所以出去了。我上了楼梯，琼感到口渴，女仆带她到仆人的住处找些饮料。哈罗德不在起居室，我大声喊他，也没有回答。我感到失望，因为我希望能在那里看到他。我走进卧室，原来哈罗德根本没有出去，他正躺在床上睡觉。我觉得很有意思，因为他总是假装他下午从不睡觉的，他说白人不需要这个习惯。我轻轻地走到床边，我想我可以跟他开个玩笑。我掀起蚊帐，看到他仰面躺着，除了一条纱笼之外什么也没穿，一个空的威士忌酒瓶就放在他的身侧，他喝醉了。

“他又开始喝了，我多年来的努力付诸东流，我的梦想被击了个粉碎，希望不复存在了，我变得怒不可遏。”

米莉森特的脸又一次变成了深红色，她紧紧抓住椅子的扶手。

“我抓住他的肩膀，用尽全力晃动他。‘你这畜生，’我叫道，‘你这个畜生！’我太生气了，我不知道自己做了什么，说了什么，我一直在晃他。你们不知道那一刻他看起来是多么令人憎恶——一个肥胖的大个子，半裸着身子，他已经几天没刮脸了，脸色青紫浮肿。他的呼吸非常沉重，我冲他大声叫喊，但他根本没有反应。我想把他拖下床来，但他太重了，躺在那里像块木头一样。‘睁开眼！’我尖叫道。我又开始晃他，我恨他，我比任何时候都恨他，因为一周来，我真心地爱着他，但他叫我失望了，叫我失望了。我想告诉他他是个多么肮脏的禽兽，但无论如何都不管用。‘你睁开眼睛！’我大喊道。我决心要让他看着我。”

寡妇舔了舔她那干燥的嘴唇。她的呼吸似乎加快了，而后忽然陷入沉默。

“如果他处于那种状态，我想最好的方式是让他继续睡觉。”凯思林说道。

“床侧的墙上有一把帕兰刀。你们知道，哈罗德对古董有多么喜欢。”

“什么是帕兰刀？”斯金纳夫人问。

“别犯傻了，孩子他妈，”她的丈夫暴躁地回答道，“你身后的墙上就有一把。”

他指了指那把马来刀，但不知为何，他的目光在刀上不知不觉地停留了一会儿。斯金纳夫人猛地缩回到沙发的一角，有点儿紧张地摆了个手势，仿佛有条蛇蜷缩在身边。

“突然，哈罗德的脖子喷出一股血来，脖子上有一道很长很深的血淋淋的伤口。”

“米莉森特，”凯思林一下子跳了起来，差点儿向她扑过去，“你到底什么意思？”

斯金纳夫人目瞪口呆地盯着她。

“墙上的帕兰刀没有了，正在床上放着。哈罗德睁开了眼睛——那双眼睛跟琼的眼睛一模一样。”

“我不明白，”斯金纳夫人说道，“如果他的状态跟你说的一样，他怎么会自杀呢？”

凯思林抓住姐姐的胳膊，愤怒地摇晃着。

“米莉森特，看在上帝的分儿上，你说说是怎么回事。”

米莉森特挣脱开了。

“帕兰刀本来是挂在墙上的，我告诉过你们。我不知道发生了什么事，到处是血，哈罗德睁开了眼睛，但气若游丝，一句话也说不出，只是微微有些喘气。”

斯金纳先生终于开口了。

“你这个可怜的人，这是谋杀呀。”

米莉森特脸红一块，白一块，带着轻蔑和愤恨看了父亲一眼，他坐回到椅子上。斯金纳夫人喊叫起来。

“米莉森特，不是你干的，是吧？”

米莉森特接下来的表现让他们血管里的血液一下子变得冰冷。她咯咯笑起来。

“我不知道谁干的。”她说。

“我的上帝啊。”斯金纳先生嘟囔说。

凯思林直挺挺地站着，两只手放在胸口，似乎心脏的剧烈跳动已让她无法承受。

“后来怎么样了？”她问。

“我尖叫起来，冲到窗前，把窗子猛地打开，喊女仆过来。她抱着琼穿过院子跑过来了。‘不要抱琼过来，’我叫道，‘不要让她进来。’她叫来厨师，让他抱着孩子。我大声叫她赶紧，她到了后，我把哈罗德指给她看。‘先生自杀了！’我叫道。她尖叫了一声，跑出了房间。

“没人愿意靠近，他们都吓傻了。我给弗朗西斯先生写了封信，告诉他发生的一切，让他赶紧过来。”

“你是怎么告诉他所发生的事情的？”

“我跟他说，我刚从河口回来就发现哈罗德受伤了，脖子划开了。你们知道，在热带地区人死后必须尽快掩埋起来。我买了口中国棺材，士兵们在‘要塞’后面挖了个坟墓。当弗朗西斯先生到了后，哈罗德已经埋了两天了。他还很年轻，我想叫他干什么都可以。我告诉他我看到哈罗德手里有一把帕兰刀，他毫无疑问是在震颤性谵妄发作时自杀的。我给他看了那个空酒瓶。仆人们说，自打我离家去海边以来他就一直在酗酒。在瓜拉索洛我跟他们说了同样的话。每个人对我都很好，政府给我发了一笔抚恤金。”

短时间里没有人说话。最后，斯金纳先生回过神来。

“我从事的是法律职业，我是律师，我有一定的责任，我们过去的执业经历一直极受尊重。不过，你现在把我置入了一个非常糟糕的境地。”

他绞尽脑汁地搜寻着措辞，但在支离破碎的思绪中，那些话语似乎在跟他玩捉迷藏。米莉森特轻蔑地看了他一眼。

“你要怎么样？”

“这是谋杀，的确如此。你认为我能纵容这件事情吗？”

“别胡说了，爸爸，”凯思林厉声说道，“你想让你的亲生女儿栽进去吗？”

“你把我置入了一个非常糟糕的境地。”他重复道。

米莉森特又耸了耸肩。

“你们非要让我说出真相。我自己已经忍受得够久了，是时候轮到你们来忍受了。”

就在这时，女仆打开了门。

“戴维斯把车开过来了，先生。”她说。

凯思林心里有话要说，女仆退了出去。

“我们最好出发吧。”米莉森特说。

“我现在不能去参加晚会了，”斯金纳夫人害怕地嚷道，“我感到极其不安，我们该怎么面对海伍德一家？主教还希望同你结识呢。”

米莉森特冷漠地做了个手势，眼睛里依然带着讥讽的神色。

“我们必须去，妈妈，”凯思林说，“如果不去那就显得可笑了。”她满脸愠怒地转向米莉森特，“哦，我觉得整件事简直太荒唐，太有失体统了。”

斯金纳夫人无助地看了看丈夫。他走过去抓住她的手，帮助她从沙发上站了起来。

“恐怕必须得去，孩子他妈。”他说。

“我丝绒帽上的羽毛还是哈罗德亲自给我的。”她哀痛道。

他领着她走出了房间，凯思林紧紧跟在母亲身后，米莉森特走在最后面，隔了一两步。

“你们会习惯的。”她静静地说，“起初，这件事在我脑子里一直萦绕不去，不过现在有两三天我没想到它了，似乎并没有什么危险。”

他们都没有回答。四个人走出大厅，从前门出去了。三名女士坐在汽车后排，斯金纳先生坐在司机旁边。汽车没有自动启动装置，是一辆老款车。戴维斯来到引擎罩前，把车发动了起来。斯金纳先生转过身，焦躁地看着米莉森特。

“你根本不应该告诉我，”他说道，“我觉得你也太自私了。”

戴维斯坐上了驾驶座，他们开着车去参加卡农家的花园晚会了。

简


张晓峰　译





第一次见到简·福勒的情形至今还清晰地印在我的脑海中。我当时对她的观察非常仔细，所以才能对自己的记忆如此自信。回想往事，我必须承认我发现自己没有卷入到一场荒诞的恶作剧中真是令人难以置信。我最近刚从中国回到伦敦，此刻正在跟托尔夫人喝茶。托尔夫人赶时髦，把家里重新装潢过了。带着女性特有的冷酷，她将舒舒服服地坐了好几年的椅子，将自打结婚以来就伴随她的桌子、柜子和室内的装饰品，将她生下来就看到的油画等，全都扫地出门。然后将一切都交到一个专家手里，由他去设计。她客厅里和她有联系的，或者说是有感情的东西一件也没有保留下来。那天她特意邀请我去她家看看，看看她家新近完工的装潢，看看那些值得夸耀的时髦摆设。她家里的摆设能酸洗的都酸洗了，不能酸洗的则刷了漆。所有的摆设都不是配套的，但搭在一起还算和谐。

“你还记得我以前那套可笑的客厅家具吗？”托尔夫人问道。

窗帘极尽奢华，沙发上盖着意大利锦缎，我坐的椅子表面是斜针绣的布料。整个客厅十分漂亮，华丽但不俗气，新颖但不做作。但在我看来，好像缺了点儿什么。我一面嘴上对客厅的装潢赞不绝口，一面心里纳闷，为什么我会更喜欢那套被淘汰的印花棉布面的旧家具，以及我熟悉已久的维多利亚风格的水粉画，还有那些原先用来装饰壁炉台的可笑的德累斯顿瓷器。我想，我所怀恋的还是那些已经被那个有利可图的装修行业全部撵出房间的旧装饰。这个效果真的让人满意吗？但托尔夫人看上去很是满意。

“你不喜欢这些雪花石膏灯吗？”她问道，“这些灯的灯光真柔和。”

“我个人更喜欢亮一些的灯。”我微笑着说道。

“要让灯光既明亮又柔和，这可太难了一点儿。”托尔夫人笑道。

我猜不出她到底有多大岁数。当我还完全是个年轻人时她就已经是一个比我大很多的已婚妇女了，但她现在将我视作她的同辈人来对待。她经常说她对自己的岁数并不保密，她现在已满四十了。然后她会微笑着补上一句，所有女人透露的岁数，都会比她的实际年龄少五年。她说自己从来都不会刻意去掩饰自己染发的事实（她有一头漂亮的棕色头发，略有一点儿红）。她说她染发是因为当头发刚开始变灰的时候真的太丑了。一旦头发彻底白了，她就不会再染发了。

“那时候人们就会说我是鹤发童颜了。”

与此同时，这张童颜上还化了淡妆，双眼也仔细地描画过了，显得非常灵动。她是一个漂亮的女人，身着一件制作精美的礼服。她说自己刚满四十岁。在雪花石膏灯昏暗的光线下，你绝对看不出她会比这个岁数大上哪怕是一天。

“只有在梳妆台前，我才能忍受三十二只烛光似的电灯泡耀眼的光线，”她露出一种玩世不恭的微笑，补充道，“在梳妆台前我需要明亮的灯光，这样我才能看清自己的真实容貌，才能采取一些必要的补救措施。”

我俩轻松愉快地闲聊着互相都认识的一些熟人。托尔夫人告诉了我一些最近广为流传的丑闻，使我也能够与时俱进。奔波于世界各地之后，能坐在这样一把舒适的椅子上，感受着壁炉中熊熊燃烧的炉火，品尝着陈列在优雅茶几上的精美茶点，与这样一位言谈风趣、引人注目的女士闲谈着，真是让人感到惬意。她把我当成了一名刚刚摆脱了自己的酸臭皮囊的浪子，刻意对我关照有加。她对自己举办晚宴的能力颇感自豪。无论是妥善安置来宾，还是为他们呈上精美的食物，她都没少花心思，而任何有幸参加她举办的宴会的客人，都把这视为一次莫大的享受。现在她已经确定了下次举办宴会的时间，问我想要在宴会上见到哪些人。

“只有一件事我得先告诉你。如果简·福勒还在这里，我就不得不推迟这次宴会了。”

“简·福勒是谁？”

托尔夫人露出了苦笑。

“简·福勒是我的心病。”

“哦！”

“你还记得我屋子装修之前放在钢琴上的一张照片吗？照片中的那个女人穿着袖口收紧的紧身衣，胸前挂着小金坠盒，她前额宽大，头发向后梳着，耳朵露在外面，扁平的大鼻子上架着一副眼镜。没错，那就是简·福勒。”

“你的房间装修前到处都是照片。”我心不在焉地说道。

“那时的房间真是乱啊，现在真不敢想象当时的情景。我把那些照片都装进了一个大牛皮纸包，放在阁楼里了。”

“好吧，这个简·福勒到底是谁呢？”我又问了一遍，同时微微一笑。

“她是我的大姑姐，是我丈夫的姐姐，嫁给了一个北方的制造商。她已经守寡多年了。她非常有钱。”

“为什么她会是你的心病呢？”

“她很有钱啊，穿着邋遢啊，举止粗野啊。她看起来要比我大二十岁，可她几乎逢人必说我俩是同学。她把家庭情谊看得太重，而我又是她唯一在世的亲戚，所以她把我看得很重。她只要到伦敦来，就肯定会住我这儿——她认为如果住到别处会伤害我的感情——而且她到我这里一住就是三四个星期。我俩就在客厅里坐着。她打打毛线，看看书。有时她会坚持请我到克拉里奇饭店[1]吃饭。她看起来就像是一个滑稽的老女佣，我很不情愿让人看见我和她坐在一起吃饭，可旁边的桌上却尽是熟人。在我俩坐车回家的路上，她还说非常高兴能小小地款待我一次。她还亲手为我编织茶壶保暖套，只要她在这里，我就不得不用，还有那些为餐厅桌子量身定做的小餐布和搁在中央的小装饰品。”

托尔夫人停下来喘了口气。

“我本以为像您这么聪明的女人肯定能想出办法来应付这样的事。”

“哎，你是不知道，我根本没机会啊。她是个大善人，对我是真的很好了。我虽然对她烦得要命，但我说什么也不能让她猜到这一点。”

“她什么时候到？”

“明天。”

但话音未落，门铃就响了起来，然后大厅里传来了一阵轻微的骚动。一两分钟后，管家领进来了一位老夫人。

“福勒夫人到。”他高声宣道。

“简，”托尔夫人跳了起来，大声喊道，“我可没想到你今天就到了。”

“你的管家也是这样对我说的，但我在信中确实是说我今天到。”

托尔夫人恢复了镇定。

“哎呀，没关系。你什么时候来我都很高兴。还好，今晚我没有别的应酬。”

“你千万不要为我费心。我只要一枚煮鸡蛋做晚餐就够了。”

一时间，托尔夫人那漂亮的脸蛋微微扭曲了一下。就一枚煮鸡蛋！

“噢，我想我们能够吃得更好一些。”

当我想到这两位女士的岁数几乎相当时，就禁不住偷偷乐了。福勒夫人看起来足有五十五岁了。她的块头有点儿大，戴着一顶黑色宽边草帽，帽檐下垂着的黑色孔眼面纱一直搭到肩上。她外披一件样式古怪且配有过多装饰的披风，内着一件黑色长裙，显得非常臃肿，就好像她还在里面穿了几条衬裙一样，脚上则踩着一双肥大的靴子。她显然是个近视眼，因为她看你时得透过那副大大的金边眼镜。

“喝杯茶好吗？”托尔夫人问道。

“如果没有给你添太多麻烦的话就来一杯好了。我先把披风脱下来。”

她先扯下了戴在手上的黑色手套，然后卸下了披风。她的颈上戴着一条硕大的金项链，链上垂着一个很大的金坠盒。我觉得里面装的一定是她已故丈夫的照片。接着她又摘下帽子，并将帽子、手套和披风一起整整齐齐地放到了沙发的角落里。托尔夫人见此抿紧了双唇。这些服饰和这个托尔夫人重新装饰的、简朴但却不失奢华之美的客厅放在一起，当然显得格格不入。我很是好奇福勒夫人到底是从哪里搞到她身上穿的这些不同寻常的服装的。这些服装都很新，且质地昂贵。居然还有裁缝在制作这些已经二十多年都没被人穿过的服装，真是太让我感到震惊了。福勒夫人一头灰白的头发，发型很普通，前额和耳朵都露在外面，头发中间简单地分了个缝。她的头发显然从来没有用过马塞尔牌卷发钳。现在她的目光落在了茶几上。茶几上摆放着格鲁吉亚银茶壶和伍斯特瓷杯。

“玛丽恩，我上次来的时候给你编了一个茶壶保暖套，怎么没了？”她问道，“你没有用吗？”

“用了，我每天都用，”托尔夫人虚情假意地说道，“但不幸的是，前几天出了点儿小事故，保暖套被烧坏了。”

“我刚给你的就烧坏了？”

“我们确实是太不当心了。”

“没有关系，”福勒夫人微笑着说道，“我很乐意再给你编织一个。我明天就上自由商店去买一些丝线。”

托尔夫人的脸一下就拉了下来。

“我可真不值得你再费心了。你所在教区牧师的妻子不是要一个吗？”

“噢，我刚送给她一个了。”福勒夫人欢快地说道。

我注意到她一笑就会露出一口小巧整齐的皓齿。她的牙齿真的很漂亮，笑容也很甜美。

但我意识到我是时候离开让两位女士独处了，于是我就告辞了。

第二天一早，托尔夫人的来电就吵醒了我。我立即就从她的声音中听出她现在非常兴奋。

“我告诉你一个最奇妙的新闻，”她说道，“简就要结婚了。”

“你在开玩笑吧。”

“新郎今晚就要到我家来吃饭，她要把他介绍给我。我想要你也过来。”

“噢，我在那儿恐怕会有些碍事吧？”

“不，不碍事。是简提出的，她让我邀请你来。一定要来啊！”

她难以抑制地笑个不停。

“新郎是谁？”

“我不知道。她告诉我他是一个建筑师。你能想象到简会嫁给一个什么样的男人吗？”

我反正也没有什么事可做，而且托尔夫人的宴席肯定相当棒。

我到她家的时候，托尔夫人正一个人待着。她身着一件茶会礼服，礼服的花色于她而言稍稍有点儿年轻，但看起来还是十分漂亮。

“简正在为她的梳妆打扮做收尾工作。我非常想让你见见她，她现在正心慌意乱呢。她说他非常喜欢她。他的名字叫吉尔伯特。当她提到他名字的时候声音都颤抖了，简直是滑稽透了，弄得我差点儿笑出声来。”

“不知道他长得如何。”

“噢，我相信我知道。肥头大耳，秃顶，啤酒大肚上挂着一根粗粗的金链。他肯定有一张肥硕而红润的脸膛，胡须刮得干干净净。他说话的嗓音肯定非常洪亮。”

福勒夫人走了进来。她穿着一条非常硬挺的黑色丝绸礼服裙，礼服裙的下摆很宽，裙尾拖地；她的绸服领部微微带点V字形，衣袖一直垂到了肘部；她的脖子上戴着一条镶有宝石的银项链。她手上拿着一副黑色长手套和一柄黑色鸵鸟羽毛扇。可以看出，她是竭力要展示出真实的自我，而绝大多数人都难以做到这一点。你看到她，除了认为她是一个值得尊敬的寡妇，前夫是一个家境殷实的北方工厂主之外，再无他想。

“简，你的脖子真的太美了。”托尔夫人友善地笑了笑，说道。

与她饱经风霜的面孔相比，她的脖子确实很白嫩，这真让人吃惊。她脖子上的皮肤白晳光滑，一点儿皱纹都没有。也就是那时，我注意到其实她的头颅放在肩膀上的位置，十分恰到好处。

“玛丽恩将消息告诉你了吗？”她对我说道，同时微微一笑，非常亲切自然，仿佛我俩已经是老朋友了。

“我必须向您表示祝贺。”我说道。

“等你看到我年轻的新郎时，再说这句话吧。”

“你一讲到你年轻的新郎，语气总是那么甜蜜。”托尔夫人笑道。

福勒夫人的眼睛此时一定躲在那副滑稽的眼镜后面闪闪发光。

“千万别以为他有多老哦。你肯定也不希望我嫁给一个一条腿已经伸进棺材里的糟老头子，对吧？”

她只给了我们这一个预告，但也确实没有时间来详细议论她的新郎了。管家已经打开了大门，高声宣道：

“吉尔伯特·纳皮尔先生到。”

一位年轻人走进了客厅，他穿着一身裁剪得十分合体的无尾礼服，身材纤瘦，个子不太高，一头漂亮的头发微微带点儿自然卷，胡须剃得很干净，眼睛蓝蓝的。他的长相谈不上特别英俊，但和善可亲，招人喜欢。十年后他可能是一个脸色蜡黄、身材干瘪的男人，但眼下，由于非常年轻，他显得朝气蓬勃、干净整洁、精神饱满。他肯定不超过二十四周岁。我第一个念头是，这个人是简·福勒夫人未婚夫的儿子（我不知道他是个鳏夫），他来这里是来告知，他父亲由于突然出现痛风症而不能赴宴了。但他的目光一落在简·福勒夫人身上，脸上立刻就神采飞扬了。他张开双臂向她走去，简·福勒夫人也同样朝他张开双臂，她的脸上露出了羞怯的微笑，转过身来对她弟媳说道：

“玛丽恩，这位就是我的未婚夫。”

他伸出了他的手。

“我希望您能喜欢我，托尔夫人，”他说道，“简告诉我，您是她在这个世界上唯一的亲人了。”

此时，托尔夫人脸上的表情看起来可真是太绝妙了。我不由得暗自赞叹良好的教养加上社会习俗是如何勇敢地与一个女人的天性殊死搏斗的。她的脸上闪过一时来不及掩饰的情绪，先是惊愕，然后是沮丧，但很快就转变为了一副表示热切欢迎的表情。但她显然不知道该说些什么才好。吉尔伯特自然是有点儿尴尬，而我正忙着让自己不笑出声来，实在没空思考该说点儿什么。只有福勒夫人自己镇定自若。

“我知道你会喜欢他的，玛丽恩。没有谁比他更懂得享受美食了。”她转向那个年轻人，“玛丽恩家的晚餐可是享有美名的哦。”

“我知道。”他面露喜色地说道。

托尔夫人草草回了几句后，我们就走到了楼下。在接下来的晚宴中，上演了一场让我无法轻易忘怀的精妙喜剧。托尔夫人拿不定主意是不是这两个人在整蛊她，也不确定是不是简想要看她出洋相而有意隐瞒她未婚夫的年龄。但之后简并没有嘲笑她，她也没法使什么坏了。托尔夫人感到既吃惊，又气恼，同时也困惑不已，但她还是恢复了她的自制力。没有什么能使她忘记自己是一个完美的女主人，她的责任就是要确保晚宴继续进行下去。尽管她说话的语气依旧很快活，但我想知道吉尔伯特·纳皮尔是否有注意到，当她转向他时，藏在那张友善面具之下的眼神是多么冷酷、多么憎恶，她在打量他。她在设法窥探藏在他灵魂深处的秘密。我可以看得出来，她正处于盛怒之下，因为在那层厚厚的胭脂下面，她的脸颊正泛着愤怒的红光。

“玛丽恩，你今天真是红光满面呀。”简说道，并通过大圆眼镜和蔼可亲地注视着她。

“我化妆有点儿匆忙，可能是胭脂抹太多了。”

“噢，是胭脂红吗？我还以为是天然的呢。要不我也不会提及的。”她冲吉尔伯特羞怯地笑了笑，“你要知道，玛丽恩跟我念的是同一所学校。现在看看我俩，你绝对想不到这一点，对不对？不过，当然啦，我的生活一直都很平静。”

我不知道她说这番话的用意是什么，但她居然说得如此言简意赅，简直令人难以置信。但无论如何，这番话还是激怒了托尔夫人，以至于她将矜持都抛到了脑后。她爽朗地笑了起来。

“简，咱俩都已经五十出头了。”她说道。

如果她这句话的用意是想让这个寡妇感到尴尬的话，那她显然失败了。

“吉尔伯特说了，为了他的缘故，让我千万不要承认，我的岁数已经超过四十九了。”她温和地回应道。

托尔夫人的手微微颤抖了起来，但她还是找到了可以反驳的地方。

“想必你俩的年龄会有悬殊吧。”她笑道。

“二十七岁，”简说道，“你认为这个差距过大吗？吉尔伯特说，我看起来比实际年龄要年轻。我告诉过你，我可不想嫁给一个一条腿已经伸进棺材里的老男人。”

我实在忍不住大笑起来，吉尔伯特也跟着笑了起来。他的笑声非常坦率，像个大男孩似的，看起来好像简说的每句话他都觉得很有趣。但托尔夫人已经处于崩溃边缘了。我恐怕再不让她缓解一下，她就会一时忘记自己是一个要在这个圈子里混迹的女人了。我尽我所能，施以援救。

“我想您现在一定正忙于置办嫁妆吧？”我说道。

“没有。本来我想从利物浦的一个裁缝那里购置嫁妆，自打我第一次出嫁以来就一直在他那里置办衣服，但吉尔伯特不让。他非常独裁，当然他的品位也确实很高。”

她带着充满爱意的微笑注视着他，故作端庄的样子，就好像她还是一个十七岁的少女。

托尔夫人妆面之下的脸顿时变得苍白无比。

“我俩要去意大利度蜜月。吉尔伯特以前还从来没有机会去考察那些文艺复兴时期的建筑，作为一个建筑师，亲眼看一看那些建筑是很有必要的。去意大利的途中，我俩会在巴黎短暂停留，并在那儿置办我的嫁妆。”

“你俩这次要出门很长时间吗？”

“吉尔伯特已经和他的事务所请了六个月的假。这对他来说将是一次莫大的享受，对不对？你瞧，他之前从未有过两个星期以上的假期。”

“为什么没有？”托尔夫人问道。尽管她竭力掩饰，但话音依然渐渐变得冰冷。

“他根本负担不起啊，可怜的宝贝儿。”

“哦！”托尔夫人说道，音量升到惊叹的级别。

咖啡煮好了，女士们上了楼。我跟吉尔伯特开始有一搭没一搭闲聊，男人间无话可说时就是如此。但两分钟后管家给我送来了一张便条。便条是托尔夫人写的，内容如下：





赶快到楼上来，然后尽快离开，将他一起带走。我非得把这事和简说开了，才能舒心一点儿。





我信口编了个谎话。

“托尔夫人有点儿头痛，她想要上床休息了。我想如果你不介意的话，咱俩最好告辞了。”

“当然。”他回答道。

我俩上了楼，五分钟后就走出了大门。我叫了一辆出租车，提议送这个年轻人一段。

“不用了，谢谢，”他回答道，“我只要走到那个拐角，就可以搭公共汽车走了。”

托尔夫人一听到前门在我俩身后关上，立马就大发雷霆了。

“你疯了吗，简？”她大喊道。

“我相信，跟那些不经常住在疯人院的人相比，我并不算太疯。”简温和地说道。

“我可否问一下你为什么要嫁给这个年轻人？”托尔夫人问道，语气中带着一种令人生畏的彬彬有礼。

“部分原因是他不接受我的拒绝。他已经向我求过五次婚了，我已经懒得拒绝他了。”

“你有没有想过，他为什么如此着急地想要娶你？”

“我让他感到开心。”

托尔夫人恼怒地喊道：

“他是一个寡廉鲜耻的无赖。我差一点儿就当面这样告诉他了。”

“你要是那样做可就不对了，那样做太不礼貌了。”

“他一贫如洗，你家财万贯。你难道就真的傻到看不出来，他是为了你的钱才娶你的。”

简依旧泰然自若，她以一种超然的态度看着她的弟媳大发雷霆。

“我认为他不是这样的人，”她回答道，“我觉得他很喜欢我。”

“你是一个老女人了，简。”

“我可和你同岁呀，玛丽恩。”她微笑着说道。

“我可从来没有放任自流过，就我的年龄而言，我要显得年轻得多。没有一个人认为我的年龄超过了四十岁。但即便是我也不会梦想着嫁给一个比我小二十岁的男孩。”

“二十七岁。”简更正道。

“你难道是想对我说，你相信一个年轻人会真心去爱一个岁数足以做他母亲的女人？有这种可能吗？”

“我在乡村生活了很长一段时间，我相信有很多关于人的天性的事是我闻所未闻的。但我听别人讲，有个男人叫弗洛伊德，一个奥地利人，我相信……”

然而，托尔夫人粗鲁地打断了她的话。

“别傻了，简。这太不像话了，简直太下流了。我一直认为你是一个明智的女人，我做梦也想不到你竟然会爱上一个男孩。”

“我并没有爱上他，我也是这样对他说的。当然，我非常喜欢他，要不我也不会想到要嫁给他。我认为只有坦白告诉他我对他的感受，这样对他才公平。”

托尔夫人大口地喘着气，身体中的血液直冲她的脑门，她感觉呼吸有点儿困难。她手上没有扇子，但她抓过一张晚报当扇子拼命扇起来。

“如果你不爱他，那你为什么还要嫁给他？”

“我守寡的年头太长了，我的生活真的太清静了，我觉得我想要改变一下。”

“如果你想要嫁人就嫁呗，但为什么不嫁给一个与你岁数相当的男人？”

“没有任何一个与我岁数相当的男人向我求过五次婚。事实上，根本就没有与我岁数相当的男人向我求过婚。”

简一面回答，一面咯咯地笑了起来。这让托尔夫人愤怒到了极点。

“别笑，简，我真受不了。我想你的脑子出毛病了，真是太可怕了。”

这一切实在让她难以承受，她放声大哭起来。她知道在她这个年纪哭是很危险的，她的眼睛会一连肿上二十四个小时，她会看起来相当滑稽，但她无法自已。她哭了。简依旧保持着极度的平静，她透过她的大眼镜看着玛丽恩，条件反射性地将手放在大腿上，在黑色丝绸礼服裙上摩挲。

“你的生活将变得极其不幸。”托尔夫人一面抽噎着说道，一面小心翼翼地轻轻擦着眼睛，以免黑色睫毛膏被泪水弄花。

“我不这么认为，你要知道，”简以她一贯温柔而和善的语调说道，言语中似乎还带着点儿微微的笑意，“我俩就这个问题深入探讨过了。我一直都认为自己是一个很好相处的人，我认为我能够让吉尔伯特感到非常幸福和舒适，他从来没被人好好照顾过。我俩是经过深思熟虑后才决定结婚的，并且我们已经达成了一致意见，如果我们中的任何一方想要重获自由，那么另一方绝对不能加以阻拦。”

现在托尔夫人已经完全恢复了镇定，她可以说出一句刻薄的话了。

“他让你给他多少钱？”

“我提出每年给他一千英镑，但他拒绝了。当我提出这个建议时，他感到十分懊恼，他说他挣的钱足够自己花销了。”

“他比我想象的要狡猾多了。”托尔夫人尖刻地说道。

简停顿了一会儿，她用和蔼但坚定的眼光看着她的弟媳。

“你瞧，亲爱的，我跟你不同，”她说道，“你从没有像我一样长年守寡，对不对？”

托尔夫人看看她，她的脸有点儿红，她甚至感到有些不自在。但简是一个非常单纯的人，她的话当然不会含沙射影。托尔夫人镇定了一下，又摆出了一副凛然的架势。

“我现在脑子很乱，我必须要上床睡觉了，”她说道，“咱俩明天早上再继续讨论这件事。

“明天早上恐怕不大方便，亲爱的，吉尔伯特跟我明天早上要去举行婚礼。”

托尔夫人沮丧地举了举手，但她已经无话可说了。





婚礼是在结婚登记处进行的，托尔夫人和我做了证婚人。吉尔伯特穿了一套时髦的蓝西服，看起来非常年轻。他显然很紧张，对任何一个男人来说这都是一个艰难时刻。但简依然镇定自若，真让人感到钦佩。她就好像是个已经习惯了频繁结婚的时髦女人，只有她脸上微微泛起的红晕才暴露了她平静外表下些微的兴奋。对任何一个女人来说这都是一个激动人心的时刻。她穿着一件宽宽大大的银灰色天鹅绒裙，我想这件裙子多半出自那位多年来为她缝制礼服的利物浦裁缝之手（这个裁缝显然是个性格无可挑剔的寡妇）。但她为了迁就这个场合的轻浮，便戴了一顶阔边花式女帽，上面插满了鸵鸟的羽毛。她的金边眼镜使这顶帽子显得极不协调。

仪式结束后登记员（我想他有点儿被这对新人的年龄差距吓住了）同她握了手，用他严谨的官方贺词表示了祝贺。新郎面颊微红地亲吻了她。托尔夫人，一副听天由命却又苦大仇深的样子，但还是亲吻了她。然后新娘用期待的眼光看看我。显然我也应该去亲吻她，我确实也这样做了。但坦白地说，当我们一行走出结婚登记处，经过外面等着看这对新人热闹的人群时，我还是感到有点儿羞涩，直到钻进了托尔夫人的轿车我才感到松了一口气。我们开往维多利亚火车站，因为这对快乐的新人要乘下午两点的火车赶往巴黎，所以简坚持喜宴就在车站的饭店举办。她说如果不早早地到达车站的站台她总会心神不宁。托尔夫人只是出于强烈的家庭责任感才出席了喜宴，因此她对喜宴的顺利进行并没有起到太大作用，而且她什么都没有吃（这一点我没法责怪她，因为饭菜实在糟糕，而且我也讨厌在午饭时喝香槟）。她说话的声音也很压抑。但尽管如此，简还是认认真真地看了一遍菜谱。

“我总觉得一个人离家旅行之前应该有一顿丰盛的大餐才对。”她说。

我们目送他们离开后，我开车将托尔夫人送回了家。

“你认为这段婚姻能持续多长时间？”她问道，“六个月？”

“咱们还是尽量往最好的方向想吧。”我微笑着回答道。

“别开玩笑了，他俩不可能有什么好结果。你难道不认为他娶她就是图她的钱吗？这场婚姻必定长不了。我只希望她不用承受那些她注定要遭的罪。”

我笑了。她用那样的腔调说出这段仁慈的话语，让我有点儿怀疑托尔夫人真正的用意。

“呵呵，如果这场婚姻没能持续下去，你就可以这样安慰了，‘我告诫过你的。’”我说道。

“我可以向你保证，我绝不会这样做。”

“那样的话，你同样会感到满足。你会为控制住了自己没有说‘我告诫过你的’而自豪。”

“她真是又老又丑又蠢。”

“你真的认为她很蠢吗？”我问道，“她虽然说话不多，但她说的话都很中肯。”

“我这辈子就没听她说过一句笑话。”





当吉尔伯特与简度完蜜月回来后，我已经又一次踏上了去往远东的旅程，而且这一次我一去就将近两年。托尔夫人不喜欢写信，虽然我偶尔会给她寄张风景明信片，但她从不给我回信，不过我回到伦敦还不到一个星期就见到了她。我应邀出席一个宴会，然后我发现我的座位正好跟她挨着。这是一个大型宴会，我想我们就像被放进派盘里的二十四只黑画眉[2]。并且我到达的时间有点儿晚了，一陷入人群中我就头昏眼花了，根本没注意到谁坐在我旁边。但当我们都坐定后，我看了一圈围坐在长条桌旁的客人，发现许多人都是照片经常被刊登在报刊上，为公众所知悉的人物。宴会的女主人特别喜好邀请所谓的名流参加她主办的聚会，因此出席这场宴席的真可谓高朋满座，名流如云呀。

我与托尔夫人足有两年的时间没有见面了，因此自然先客套了几句，接着我就问起了简。

“她很好呀。”托尔夫人干巴巴地说道。

“那场婚姻结局如何？”

托尔夫人踌躇了一会儿，她从身前的盘子中拿起一枚咸杏。

“似乎很成功。”

“那么，是你估计错了？”

“我说过这场婚姻长不了，我现在仍然还是这样认为。这场婚姻完全违背人类的本性。”

“她现在幸福吗？”

“他们俩都很幸福。”

“我猜你与他俩见面的次数不多。”

“起初经常见面，但现在……”托尔夫人噘了噘嘴，“简变得非常气派。”

“你这话是什么意思？”我笑了起来。

“我想我应该告诉你，她今晚就在这里。”

“在这里？”

我吃了一惊，我又看了一遍围坐在桌边的人。女主人是一个令人愉快、热情好客的女人，但我无法想象她会邀请这样一个打扮俗气的老女人前来赴宴，而且她还是一个毫无名气的建筑师的妻子。托尔夫人看到我困惑不解的样子，精明地猜到了我在想什么，她略微一笑。

“注意看男主人的左边。”

我按她说的方向看去。说来也怪，坐在那里的那个女人，因为她绚丽奇异的着装打扮，因此我一走进拥挤的客厅就注意到了她。我觉得我从她的眼神中观察到了一丝与我相识的味道，但我深信我以前从未见过她。她的头发呈铁灰色，因此年纪肯定不小了。她的头发剪得短短的，紧密的小卷厚厚地附在她轮廓优美的头颅上。她没有刻意让自己显得年轻，因为她之所以在人群中引人注目，正是因为她没涂口红，没抹胭脂，甚至连粉都没有扑。她的面容算不上特别漂亮，但十分红润，且饱经风霜。但正因为没有任何人为的修饰，因而她的面容显得非常自然，很是赏心悦目。与之形成奇特对比的是她肩膀的白皙，这对肩膀真可以用绝美一词来形容。即便是一个三十岁的女人也会因为拥有这样一副肩膀而自豪的。但她的着装非常奇特，我很少见到这样大胆的穿着。裙服的领口剪裁得非常低，下摆也很短，花色是时下流行的黑黄相间。她这身装束让人感觉好像是要去参加一场化装舞会，但却很是适合她。如果换一个人穿这身衣服的话，就会让人觉得惨不忍睹，而穿在她身上却给人一种浑然天成、简单不做作的感觉。她还戴着一副用黑色宽绸带固定的单镜片眼镜，这让她的一身装束显得更加奇特而不做作，奢华而不炫耀。

“你别告诉我她就是你大姑姐！”我倒抽了一口气。

“她就是简·纳皮尔。”托尔夫人冷冷地说道。

她此时正在说话，男主人面冲着她，没等她说完脸上就露出了微笑。坐在她左侧的是一个微微有些秃头，余发全白，目光锐利，面容显得很聪慧的男人，他身体向前倾着，神情专注地听她说话。而坐在对面的两个客人也停止了交谈，专心地听着。她说完后，他们都猛然仰身，背靠椅背，哈哈大笑起来。桌子对面的一个男人跟托尔夫人搭起了话——我认出他是一个著名的政治家。

“您的大姑姐又说了个笑话，托尔夫人。”他说道。

托尔夫人微微一笑。

“她真是个无价之宝，对不对？”

“我自罚一大杯香槟，然后你无论如何也要告诉我这到底是怎么回事。”我说道。

好吧，接下来就是我所听说的关于事情的来龙去脉。

在他俩蜜月的头一站，吉尔伯特就领着简去拜访了许多巴黎的裁缝。他并不直接反对她挑选了一些她自己中意的“长袍”，而是巧妙地劝说她定做一两件“裙服”，这些“裙服”都是按照他自己设计的样式制作的，他从事这类事情似乎很有窍门。他还雇用了一个伶俐的法国女仆。简可从未经历过这样的事。以往她都是自己动手缝缝补补，如果需要“梳妆打扮”，她习惯打电话叫打扫房间的女仆来帮忙。吉尔伯特为她设计的服装与她以往的穿着样式截然不同，她从未穿过这样的服装，但他谨慎地逐渐改变着服装的样式，避免走得太快、太远。虽然心怀疑虑，但为了让他高兴，她还是说服自己尽量多穿他设计的衣服，少穿自己挑的衣服。这样一来，她过去习惯穿的那些肥大的衬裙当然也就没法上身了。她虽然也为此犹豫过，但最终她还是将这些臃肿的服装都扔了。

“嘿，说来也怪，”托尔夫人说，话音中带着一种嗤之以鼻的味道，“她除了一件薄薄的真丝紧身装之外，什么都不穿。在我看来，她这么大年纪了，没因此被冻死真是奇了。”

吉尔伯特和法国女仆教她如何穿衣打扮，出人意料的是，她很快就学会了。法国女仆为女主人漂亮的胳膊和肩膀而感到欣喜若狂。不将这样的优美展现出来那真是天理难容。

“再等等，阿芳欣妮，”吉尔伯特说道，“接下来几套我为夫人设计的服装会让她显得更美。”

那副眼镜当然很吓人了，任何人戴着一副金边眼镜都不会让人有完美的感觉。吉尔伯特让简换一副玳瑁边的眼镜试试，但他还是摇摇头。

“如果是一个女孩的话，这个搭配就很好，”他说道，“但你的岁数太大了，简，你不适合戴着眼镜。”突然，他产生了一个灵感，“哎呀，我有主意了。你一定要戴一副单镜片眼镜才行。”

“噢，吉尔伯特，这可不行。”

她看着他。他非常兴奋，那完全是一种艺术家的兴奋。她笑了。他对她真是太体贴了，她愿意做任何事情来讨他欢心。

“好吧，我试试。”她说道。

当他俩找到一家眼镜店，选完合适的镜架后，简乐呵呵地将一个单镜片眼镜扣到眼睛上。吉尔伯特拍了拍手。当时当地，就在目瞪口呆的售货员的面前，他在简的双颊上各亲了一口。

“你看起来真是太美了。”他喊道。

他俩就这样前往意大利，在那里愉快地度过了几个月的时间。他在那里研究文艺复兴时期和巴洛克风格的建筑。简不仅慢慢适应了她的新装束，而且还发现自己挺喜欢这样的。起初，当她走进宾馆的餐厅，所有人都转过身来盯着她看时，她还感到有点儿羞怯。以往从来没有哪个人愿意正眼看她一眼，但现在她觉得这种感觉还真是不错。女士们纷纷朝她走来，并问她是在哪里买的衣服。

“您喜欢吗？”她故作端庄地问道，“是我丈夫亲自为我设计的。”

“如果您不介意的话，我也想照您的衣服样式做一套。”

简虽然多年来一直过着一种非常闭塞的生活，但这绝不意味着她就缺乏女人固有的天性。她早就准备好了如何应对这类问题。

“我感到非常抱歉，我丈夫是一个很特别的人，他可不愿意听说有任何人复制我的衣服样式，他希望我的衣服样式独一无二。”

她本以为这样说后别人会嘲笑她，但她们没有。她们只是回答道：“哦，当然。我完全理解。您确实是独一无二的。”

但她看得出来，这些人在心里默记下了她的衣服样式，这让她感到有些烦恼。这是她生平第一次没有穿别人都在穿的衣服，她暗自思忖，她不明白为什么所有人都想要模仿她的穿着。

“吉尔伯特，”她说，以她平常的口吻来说，这样的口气算是相当急切了，“下次你再为我设计服装的话，我希望你能设计出让谁也没法模仿的服装。”

“唯一的办法就是设计出只有你能穿的服装。”

“你做不到这一点吗？”

“可以，但你先要为我做点儿事。”

“什么事？”

“剪短你的头发。”

我想这是简第一次对他的要求踌躇不决。她的头发又长又厚。她还是个姑娘的时候就为自己的头发而骄傲，将自己的头发剪掉真是一个非常激进的举措，真可称得上是破釜沉舟了。对她而言，让她觉得代价太大的不是第一步，而是最后一步。但她还是迈出了这一步（“我知道玛丽恩会认为我是个十足的傻瓜，而且我再也没法回到利物浦了。”她说），当他俩在返回住处的路上经过巴黎街头时，吉尔伯特将她领进了（她进去的时候两腿发软，心脏猛烈地跳动着）一家世界上最高档的美发店。当她走出这家美发店的时候，她的头型已经全部显露了出来，蓬松的灰色鬈发大胆地附着在她的头颅上，显得既活泼又俏丽。皮格马利翁[3]完成了他惊人的杰作，伽拉忒亚诞生了。

“好吧，”我说道，“但这些还不足以解释为什么简今晚会出现在这个满是公爵夫人、内阁大臣等上流人士的场合。她现在可是左边坐着宴会的男主人，右边坐着一位海军元帅。”

“简是个幽默大师，”托尔夫人说道，“你难道没看到她一说话，他们就全都笑了吗？”

毫无疑问，托尔夫人现在心中充满了苦楚。

“当简给我写信，告诉我他俩已经度完蜜月，正在返回伦敦时，我想我必须请他俩吃顿饭。其实我心里并不太想请他俩，但我觉得必须这样做。我知道这场宴会将会非常枯燥无味，因此我不打算牺牲任何重要人士，免得他们扫兴。但另一方面，我又不想让简认为我没有什么像样的朋友。你知道我像样的朋友也就不超过八个人。但我想只有请十二个朋友参加，才能使这场宴会够场面。我那段时间一直很忙，直到宴会开始的那天晚上才见到简。她让我们大家都等了她一小会儿——这是吉尔伯特耍的小聪明——她最后才飘然而至。我简直大吃一惊。她让餐厅内所有的女士都黯然失色，看起来土气又落伍。她让我觉得自己就像个打扮妖艳的老妓女。”

托尔夫人喝了一小口香槟。

“我希望能向你描述出她当时穿的裙服。这套裙服换成任何一个人恐怕都穿不出去，但穿在她身上却堪称完美。还有她戴的那个单镜片眼镜！我认识她已经三十五年了，我还从来没见过她不戴眼镜。”

“但你知道她身材很好。”

“我哪里知道呢？自打我认识她起，她就一直都是你第一次看见她时的那身打扮。你当时能看出她的身材好吗？她似乎没有意识到她所引起的轰动，倒认为这样的反应理所当然。我原来一直担心自己的宴会，现在总算欣慰地舒了口气。即使她有点儿不善与人交谈，有了她的这身打扮，其他的也就不重要了。她坐在餐桌的那一头，我听到那里笑声不绝于耳。客人们能在我的宴会上感到开心，这让我很高兴。但宴会结束后我却大吃了一惊，至少有三位先生过来对我说，我的大姑姐是个极为有趣的人，问我如果他们想去登门拜访，她是否会答应。当时我真是不知所措。二十四小时后，今晚宴会的女主人就给我打来了电话。她说听说我的大姑姐来伦敦了，听说她是一个极为有趣的人，问我能否请她过来吃午饭，也好见见她。这个女人的直觉从来都没有错过。果然不到一个月的时间，所有人都在谈论简。我今天能到这里来，并非由于我和女主人是认识二十年的老相识，还请她吃过无数次饭，我能受邀参加这个宴会只是由于我是简的弟媳而已。”

可怜的托尔夫人，这样的处境真是让人难堪。尽管看到她遭到报应，我不禁觉得好笑，但我还是觉得她是值得同情的。

“人们从来无法抗拒那些能使他们开怀大笑的人。”我想要安慰她，故而这样说。

“她从来都没有让我笑过。”

我又一次听见桌子那头爆发出一阵大笑声，我猜简又说了点儿什么有趣的话。

“你的意思是说，你是唯一一个认为她并不风趣的人？”我微笑着问道。

“你过去认为她是个懂幽默的人吗？”

“我必须承认，我过去也认为她并不幽默。”

“她现在说的话跟她这三十五年来说的没有什么两样。我看到大家都在笑，所以我也就跟着笑，我不想让别人认为我是一个十足的傻瓜，但我根本就没觉得她的话哪里可笑。”

“就像维多利亚女王一样[4]。”我说道。

这是一句愚蠢的笑话。托尔夫人立时拉下脸来，直截了当地这样告诉了我。我赶忙岔开话题。

“吉尔伯特也在这里吗？”我一面问，一面用目光在桌子周围搜寻着。

“当然也邀请吉尔伯特了，如果没有他同行，简是不会出门的。但今晚他要去参加一个建筑师协会或什么组织的宴会，所以就没有来这里。”

“我非常想再认识认识她。”

“吃完饭你直接过去跟她说话就行了，她会邀请你参加她举办的星期二聚会。”

“她的星期二聚会？”

“她每个星期二的晚上都在自己家里举行聚会，你能在那里见到你所听过的每一个人。这个聚会在伦敦享有盛名。她在一年的时间里就取得了这么大的成功，而我用了二十年都没有做到。”

“但你对我说的事真如同奇迹一般。她是怎么做到这一点的？”托尔夫人耸了耸她那美丽但略显肥胖的肩膀。

“你要是能告诉我为什么，我将不胜感激。”她回答道。

吃完饭后我就试图向简坐的沙发靠拢，但被人群拦住了。过了一会儿工夫，宴会的女主人走过来对我说：“我必须把你介绍给我这场聚会上的明星。你认识简·纳皮尔吗？她是一个非常风趣的人。她比你看过的喜剧要有趣多了。”

我被引到简坐的沙发旁，吃饭时一直坐在她身旁的元帅现在依然坐在她旁边，而且他丝毫也没有要走开的意思。简同我握了握手，把我介绍给元帅。

“您认识雷金纳德·弗罗比歇爵士吗？”

我们开始闲聊。简与过去我所了解的一样，还是那样简单率真，朴素不造作，但她绝妙的打扮使她无论说什么都带有一种独特的韵味。不知不觉间我已经笑得前仰后合了。她刚才说的那句话，非常通情达理，很是贴切，但根本谈不上诙谐。她说话的样子，她透过眼镜平和地瞅着我的目光都让人完全无法抗拒。我有一种彻底放松，身心愉悦的感觉。当我离开她身边的时候，她对我说：“如果您星期二晚上没有更好的去处，就到我那儿去玩。吉尔伯特会非常高兴见到你的。”

“等他在伦敦住上一个月后，他就会知道，他不会有比你那儿更好的去处的。”元帅说道。

就这样，星期二我前往了简的住处，但去得有点儿晚。说实话，我对自己周围的客人有点儿吃惊，这里真可谓是作家、画家、政治家、演员、贵妇和名媛的大集合。托尔夫人说得对，这确实是一个盛大的派对。自打斯特福德公馆[5]被卖掉之后，我在伦敦就再也没有看到过这么盛大的聚会了。聚会并没有特意安排娱乐项目，茶点虽然谈不上奢侈，但也足够丰富了。简天性沉静，她似乎在自得其乐。我没有看到她为招待客人而忙得不可开交，但客人们却喜欢到她这里来。欢快而令人感到愉快的聚会一直持续到夜里两点才结束。这次聚会之后，我经常与她见面。我不仅经常到她家里去，而且每次应邀外出吃午饭或晚饭，我也总会遇见她。我对幽默不大在行，因此总想弄清楚她的天赋异禀究竟来自哪里。模仿她的话再说一遍是不可能的，那种幽默就如同某些美酒一样，一挪就变味了。她没有写隽语的天赋，回答问题时也并没有妙语连珠。她的话语中从来没有恶意，也从来不会用绵里藏针的话去反驳别人。有些人认为智慧的灵魂在于用词不当，而非言简意赅，但简从来不说任何会使维多利亚时代的人脸红的话。我认为她的幽默是无意识行为，我确信它不是事先计划好的。她的幽默就像蝴蝶从一株鲜花飞向另一株一样，只是随性的行为，决然没有任何事先谋划好的方法和意图。她的幽默是通过她说话的方式和她的目光表现出来的。吉尔伯特为她设计的这种炫耀而夸张的打扮，让她的这种幽默感得到了微妙的增进。但她的打扮只是产生这种幽默感的部分原因。当然，现在她已经成为时尚的化身，只要她开口说话，人们就忍不住发笑。人们再也不会为吉尔伯特为何娶一个比他的岁数大那么多的妻子而感到不解了。人们都认识到，对简这样的女人而言，岁数并不重要。人们开始认为他是一个非常幸运的年轻人。那位海军元帅在跟我评论她时引用了莎士比亚的一句名言：“岁月带不走她的容颜，年华不能使她老去。”吉尔伯特很高兴她取得了成功。随着我对这个年轻人的了解日益加深，我也越来越喜欢他了。显而易见，他既不是个流氓，也不是个专门追求有钱贵妇的男人。他不仅为简感到无比自豪，而且全身心地爱着她，他对她的体贴照料让人感动。他是一个非常无私、心地善良的年轻人。

“好了，现在您怎么评价简呢？”有一次他这样对我说，语气中带有一种孩子气的胜利感。

“我不知道你们俩谁更神奇一些，”我回答道，“是你还是她。”

“哦，我没法跟她比。”

“胡说。你不会认为我傻到看不出来是你，并且只有你，成就了现在的简吧？”

“我唯一的优点就是，在肉眼看不真切的地方，看见了那些本就存在的东西。”他答道。

“你看出了她身上具有绝佳形象的可能，这我可以理解，但你将她变成了一个幽默大师，这我无论如何也想不明白。”

“我一直认为她说的话都非常有趣，她一直就是个幽默大师。”

“你可是唯一持这种观点的人。”

托尔夫人很有雅量，她现在知道自己错怪了吉尔伯特。她与吉尔伯特的关系日渐密切，但表面上她依然坚持自己的观点，认为他们的婚姻不可能长久。我忍不住嘲讽了她。

“不会吧？我还从没见过如此感情甚笃的一对夫妇呢。”我说道。

“吉尔伯特现在二十七岁了，这正是一个吸引漂亮女孩的年龄。那天晚上你注意到没有，就是在简的派对中，雷金纳德爵士那个漂亮的小侄女，我想简非常注意观察他们俩。我对此有种不祥的预感。”

“我相信简不会惧怕跟世界上的哪个小丫头较量。”

“那就等着瞧吧。”托尔夫人说道。

“你曾说过他俩的婚姻持续不了六个月。”

“哦，现在我修正为三年。”





当一个人固执己见的时候，出于人的本性，别人会希望事实能证明他是错的。托尔夫人就是这类过于自信的人。但最终我并没能从中得到满足。因为一直到最后她都坚持己见，并自信地为这对不般配的夫妻预测了结局，而事实也的确如她所料。尽管如此，命运却甚少以我们想要的方式给予我们想要的东西。托尔夫人虽然可以自以为她猜对了，但我想她很快就会意识到自己还是错了，因为事情根本就没有按照她预测的方向发展。

一天，我收到了一份她的加急电报，幸亏我立即就赶去见了她。当我被带进客厅后，托尔夫人立马从椅子上站了起来，迈着就像花豹悄悄靠近猎物一样既悄然无声又迅捷的脚步向我走来。我看出来她很是兴奋。

“简与吉尔伯特已经分手了。”她说道。

“真的吗？好吧，终究还是你说对了。”

托尔夫人用一种我无法理解的眼神看着我。

“可怜的简。”我喃喃自语道。

“可怜的简！”她重复了一遍我的话，但话音中充满了讽刺，我不禁惊呆了。

她费了好大的劲儿，才告诉我到底发生了什么。

吉尔伯特前脚离开她家，她后脚就急忙召唤了我，让我过来。他走进她家的时候脸色苍白，一副悲痛欲绝的样子。她立即就看出来糟糕之事终究发生了。他还没有开口她就知道他要说什么。

“玛丽恩，简把我甩了。”

她冲他微微一笑，握住了他的手。

“我知道你想表现得像个绅士。如果别人知道是你甩了她，那她就没有脸面了。”

“我到您这里来是因为我知道我一定能得到您的同情的。”

“哦，我不怪你，吉尔伯特，”托尔夫人非常和蔼地说道，“这是必然要发生的事情。”他叹了一口气。

“我也是这样想的。我无法指望永远拴住她，她太优秀了，而我只是一个再普通不过的人。”

托尔夫人拍拍他的手。他的表现确实很绅士。

“现在到什么程度了？”

“哎，她要跟我离婚。”

“简一直说，如果你想要娶哪个姑娘，她不会挡你的道。”

“您难道以为自从我做了简的丈夫以后，我还会愿意娶任何别的女人？”他回答道。

托尔夫人感到迷惑不解了。“你的意思当然是你把简给甩了。”

“我？我怎么可能有这样的想法呢，打死我也不会这样做的。”

“那么她为什么要跟你离婚呢？”

“与我办完离婚手续后，她要马上嫁给雷金纳德·弗罗比歇爵士。”

托尔夫人尖声叫了起来，她感到自己的头脑中一片空白，不得不掏出嗅盐来闻闻。

“在你为她做了那么多之后？”

“我没为她做什么呀。”

“难道说你就这样答应了她，让她利用完后就把你甩了？”

“我俩婚前有过约定，如果我俩中有一人想要离婚，另一人不得设置障碍。”

“但那是为你设置的，因为你比她年轻二十七岁。”

“好吧，结果这个约定被她用上了。”他语调酸楚地答道。

托尔夫人又是规劝，又是争辩，又是理论，但吉尔伯特坚持认为没有哪条规定对简管用，不管她想做什么，他都必须照办无误。他离开后托尔夫人感到六神无主，将事情的经过完整地告诉我之后她才大大地松了一口气。看到我与她一样对这件事感到吃惊，她很是高兴。至于我没有与她一样对简的这个行为表示愤慨，她认为是因为我的性别，生来就可耻地缺乏道德观念。当她还处于非常激动的状态下时，客厅的门被推开了，管家将简领了进来。她一身黑白相间的着装，这无疑与她目前有点儿模棱两可的身份相契合，但她身上服装的样式非常新颖、奇特，头上戴着的帽子很是引人注目。看到她时，我不禁倒吸了一口气，但她依然是那样平和镇静。她走上前来想要亲吻托尔夫人，但托尔夫人却端着架子冷冰冰地躲开了。

“吉尔伯特刚离开这里。”她说。

“是的，这我知道，”简微笑着说道，“是我让他过来见你的。我今晚要到巴黎去，我想拜托你在这段时间里关照关照他。我担心他在开始的这段时间里会有点儿孤独。如果你能对他多留心一点儿，我心里会感到好受一些。”

托尔夫人双手一拍，说道：“吉尔伯特刚才对我说了件让我感到难以置信的事。他告诉我，你要与他离婚，然后嫁给雷金纳德·弗罗比歇。”

“你不记得了吗？在我与吉尔伯特结婚前，你曾建议我要嫁给一个与我岁数相当的男人。元帅今年五十三岁。”

“但是，简，你现在的一切全要归功于吉尔伯特，”托尔夫人愤愤不平地说道，“如果没有他，你能有今天吗？如果没有他给你设计服装，你什么都不是。”

“哦，他答应继续为我设计服装。”简平和地说道。

“没有哪个女人还能找到比他更合格的丈夫了。他对你是始终如一的关爱。”

“哦，我知道他很贴心。”

“那你怎么还能这样没有良心呢？”

“可我从来就没有爱过吉尔伯特呀，”简说道，“我一直是这样告诉他的。我现在开始感到需要一个与我同龄男人的陪伴了。我想可能是我嫁给吉尔伯特的时间够长了。这个年轻人与我没有什么共同语言。”她略微停顿了一下，向我俩露出了迷人的微笑，“我当然不会忘了吉尔伯特。我已经与雷金纳德安排好了，元帅有一个侄女与他很般配。等我俩结婚后，会马上邀请他俩到马耳他和我们一起住——要知道，元帅即将就任皇家海军地中海地区的司令官——如果他俩相爱了，我可一点儿也不会感到惊讶。”

托尔夫人有点儿嗤之以鼻。

“你是否也与元帅达成了协议，如果你俩中某一方想要离婚，另一方不得设置任何障碍？”

“我提过这样的建议，”简泰然自若地回答道，“但元帅说，但凡是好东西，他一看便知，他不会再娶别的女人了。而如果有人想要娶我——他说他的旗舰上有八门口径十二英寸的大炮，他会近距离与这个人讨论这个问题。”她通过眼镜看了我俩一眼。即使担心托尔夫人生气，我也止不住笑了起来。“呵呵，元帅真是个多情的男人。”

托尔夫人怒气冲冲地冲我皱了下眉头。

“我从来都不认为你很幽默，简，”她说，“我也从来都不理解为什么你一说话人们就会捧腹大笑。”

“我也从来都不认为自己很风趣，玛丽恩，”简微笑着说道，露出了她光洁整齐的牙齿，“我很高兴能在太多的人接受我们的看法之前离开伦敦。”

“我希望您能告诉我，您取得如此巨大的成功的秘密是什么。”我说道。

她转头看向我，依然是那副我所熟悉的、平和而朴素的神情。

“你知道，当我嫁给吉尔伯特，我俩定居在伦敦后，不管我说什么别人都要笑。对此，我比任何人都更感吃惊。我这样说话已经有三十年了，这之前没有任何人觉得有什么可笑的。我曾认为这一定是由于我的服装样式或者是我的短发，再不然就是我的眼镜的缘故。但后来我发现，我的话之所以惹人发笑是由于我说了实话。人们认为讲实话很幽默这太不寻常了，终有一天会有某人发现这个秘密。当人们对讲实话习以为常后，人们当然也就不会认为这有什么好笑的了。”

“为什么我是唯一一个认为这没有什么可笑的人呢？”托尔夫人问道。

简踌躇了片刻，仿佛她真的在寻找一个满意的解释。

“也许是因为当你看到真相时，你没有意识到那就是真相，亲爱的玛丽恩。”她以自己一贯的方式，语气温和地说道。

这句话无疑是对她的盖棺定论。我感觉简说的话总是能一语中的。她确实是个无价之宝。

快到上床时间了，明天早上醒来就能看到陆地啦！麦克费尔医生点上烟斗，斜靠在船栏上，搜寻着夜空里的南十字星座。在前线待了两年，有个早该愈合的伤口迟迟没能痊愈，他很高兴能到阿皮亚安静地住上至少十二个月，并且在旅途中，他已经感觉好多了。因为有些乘客明天将在帕果帕果下船，他们今晚刚刚举行了一场小型舞会，自动演奏钢琴尖厉的音符至今还在他的耳畔萦绕，但甲板上终于安静了下来。不远处，他看到他的妻子正坐在一把长椅上跟戴维森夫妇聊天，便溜达到了她那儿去。他在灯下落座，摘掉帽子——你能看到，他有着一头赤红色的头发，头顶秃了一块；长满雀斑的红皮肤倒也与赤发交相辉映。他年已四十，瘦骨嶙峋，脸颊干瘪瘪的，为人处世一丝不苟，颇有点儿学究味；他操着一口苏格兰口音，嗓门很小，说起话来很是文静。

戴维森夫妇是传教士，麦克费尔夫妇跟他们产生了一种同舟共济的情谊，这倒不是因为他们趣味多相投，顶多只能算是相似。他们主要的联系便是都看不惯那些没日没夜地在吸烟室打扑克、玩桥牌、酗酒的人。麦克费尔夫人一想到她和她的丈夫是戴维森夫妇在船上唯一乐于交往的人，就有点儿受宠若惊，甚至连医生自己——他虽然很腼腆，但并不蠢——也模糊地觉得这是对自己的恭维，而这不过是因为他长着一颗喜欢争强好辩的头脑，他觉得晚上在船舱里跟人发发牢骚也未尝不可。

“戴维森夫人说，要是没有我们，她真不知道这次旅行要怎么熬过来。”麦克费尔夫人一边说着，一边娴熟地梳理着自己的假发，“她说在这条船上也就我们两个她还愿意认识。”

“我并不觉得传教士是多大的人物啊，居然如此装腔作势。”

“不是装腔作势，我非常明白她的意思。让戴维森夫妇跟吸烟室那些粗人混在一起，这的确很不好。”

“他们的宗教创始者可没这么排外。”麦克费尔医生笑着说。

“我跟你说过多少遍了，不要拿宗教开玩笑。”他妻子说道，“我不喜欢你这种性格，亚历克，你从来看不到别人的长处。”

他用黯淡的蓝眼睛斜瞥了她一眼，没有回话。多年来的婚姻生活使他学会了一点：将最后一句话留给他的妻子更有利于和谐共处。他赶在她之前脱掉了衣服，爬到了上铺，然后躺下来读点儿书，便可以睡觉了。

第二天早上，当他来到甲板上时，船已经快靠岸了。他用渴望的目光注视着岸上的一切。那是一片细长的银色沙滩，紧紧挨着一片草木茂盛的山冈。椰子树蓊蓊郁郁，几乎延伸到了水边。树丛中你可以看见萨摩亚人居住的草屋和随处可见的小型教堂，散发着亮闪闪的白光。戴维森夫人走过来站在了他身边。她身着一袭黑衣，脖子上戴着一条金项链，上面挂着个小小的十字架。她是个身材矮小的女人，枯燥的褐色头发梳理得一丝不乱，不起眼的夹鼻眼镜后面是一双突起的蓝眼睛。她的脸蛋长长的，就像绵羊的脸一样，但并不给人愚蠢之感，相反会让人觉得极为机警。她动作敏捷，如鸟儿一样。而她身上最惹人注意的地方便是她的嗓音，高亢，刺耳，一点儿也不婉转；当尖厉单调的嗓音传入你的耳中时，就像无情喧嚣的风钻一般，让你的神经不胜其烦。

“这里看起来一定和你家那边很像。”麦克费尔医生说道，脸上带着一种不自然的浅笑。

“我们那里都是低平的岛屿——你知道的，跟这里的不同。那里都是珊瑚岛，这里全是火山岛，还得再花上十天才能到我们那里。”

“在这些地方，简直就像在家里邻近的街道上一样。”麦克费尔医生戏谑道。

“哦，这样说未免有点儿太夸张了，不过在南太平洋，人们对于远近的理解不同。照这样来看，你的说法也没错。”

麦克费尔医生淡淡地叹了口气。

“我很高兴我们没在这儿驻扎，”她继续说道，“他们说在这个地方极难开展工作。出入的轮船让居民们没法安生，而且这里还有一座军港，这对当地人来说可不是什么好事。在我们那个区，根本不存在像这样的困难需要我们去应对。当然也有一两个商人，但我们注意对他们严加管教，要是他们不服从管教，我们就会想方设法地让他们在那里待不下去，他们也就只能心甘情愿地离开了。”

她固了固鼻梁上的眼镜，冷冷地凝视着这片绿色的岛屿。

“对于传教士而言，要想在这里布道几乎就是一个无望的工作。我对上帝感激不尽，至少我们是幸免于难了。”

戴维森所在的教区包括北萨摩亚的一群岛屿，各岛屿之间相隔遥远，所以他不得不经常乘独木舟去远方的岛屿，这种时候，他妻子就留在总教区处理布道事务。一想到她布道时的精明强干，麦克费尔医生就不由得心头一沉。当谈起当地土著人的堕落时，她慷慨陈词，滔滔不绝，令人战栗，任何东西都不能让她消声；她的感觉敏锐得超乎寻常。早在他们初识时，她便跟他说过：

“要知道，当我们最初上岛时，他们的婚俗真是让人触目惊心，我没法跟你描述，不过我可以告诉你妻子，她会转述给你的。”

接下来，他便看到他妻子和戴维森夫人的帆布躺椅紧紧地靠在一起，她们认真交谈了差不多两小时。当他为了活动一下身体，来来回回从她们身边路过好几次时，他曾听到戴维森夫人激动的低语声，宛如远处山涧的流水，他还看到妻子大张的嘴，苍白的脸，她似乎正享受着一种令人惊异的体验。晚上在他们自己的船舱里，她压低音量，把听来的话完完整整地向他复述了一遍。

“看吧，我怎么跟你说的？”第二天早上，戴维森夫人欢欣雀跃地喊道，“你可曾听过比那更恐怖的事吗？你懂得我为什么不能直接告诉你了吧？尽管你是名医生。”

戴维森夫人打量着他的脸，她显然热切渴望看到自己预期的效果。

“你能想象到我们初到那里时的心灰意冷吗？要是我告诉你，要在那里的村庄里找到一个好的单身女孩是根本不可能的事，你绝对无法相信。”

她极富技术性地运用了“好的”这个词语。

“戴维森先生和我讨论过这件事，我们决定从遏制跳舞着手。这帮土著人对跳舞可痴迷了。”

“我年轻时倒也不反对跳舞。”麦克费尔医生说道。

“昨天晚上我听到你邀请麦克费尔夫人陪你跳一圈时，我就差不多猜到了。我认为，如果一个男人只跟自己妻子跳舞，这不会产生任何真正的伤害——她不愿陪你跳，倒让我松了一口气。在这种情况下，我认为我们最好严于克己自持。”

“在什么情况下？”

戴维森夫人透过夹鼻眼镜快速地扫了他一眼，但并没有回答他的问题。

“不过在白人之间，情况就不太一样。”她继续说道，“但戴维森先生说，他不明白一个丈夫怎么能够袖手旁观，眼睁睁地看着自己的妻子向另一个男人投怀送抱。我得说我相当赞同他的说法，就我而言，自打结婚以来我就再没跳过一步舞。但当地人跳舞完全是另外一回事，跳舞不仅本身就不道德，而且显然会导致伤风败俗。不管怎样，感谢上帝，我们将它铲除掉了，八年来在我们的教区没有一个人跳舞，我认为这样说没错。”

现在他们来到了海港的入口处，麦克费尔夫人也加入了他们的谈话。船转了个急弯后便缓缓向前行进。这是一个为广大陆地所包围的海港，大得足足可以装下一支战舰舰队，海港四周矗立着高耸陡峭的绿色山丘。靠近入口，海风轻拂，这里坐落着为花园所环绕的总督府。星条旗无精打采地耷拉在旗杆上。他们驶过两三座排列整齐的平房和一个网球场，接着就来到了带仓库的码头前。戴维森夫人指了指停泊在离岸边两三百码处的一艘双桅帆船，它将把他们载往阿皮亚。岸边汇集着从岛屿的四面八方赶来的一群热切、喧嚣、欢天喜地的土著人，有些是来看稀奇的，有些则是来同前往悉尼的旅客交换东西的——他们带来了菠萝、大串的香蕉、树皮布衣服、贝壳项链、鲨鱼牙齿、卡瓦碗，还有战船模型。穿戴整齐、胡子刮得干干净净、神情率真的美国船员们，夹在人群中闲逛，旁边还有一小群政府官员。在行李上岸的空闲时间里，麦克费尔夫妇和戴维森夫人观望着这片人群。麦克费尔医生注意到这里的绝大多数孩子和年轻人似乎都患上了雅司病，一种类似慢性溃疡的难看的褥疮；另外他自从医以来第一次见到了象皮病，这使得他那双专业的眼睛闪闪发光——该病患者要么长着一只巨大而笨重的手臂，要么拖着一条严重变形的腿蹒跚前行。无论男女，腰间都系着拉瓦拉瓦[1]。

“这种服装太不像话了，”戴维森夫人说道，“戴维森先生认为法律应该禁止如此穿着。除了腰间裹着一条红棉布之外，身上几乎一丝不挂，你怎么能够指望这样的人讲道德？”

“就气候而言，这样的穿着再合适不过了。”医生揩了揩头上的汗水说道。

现在他们已经上了岸，尽管还是大清早，但那股热劲儿已经压得人喘不过气来。由于被群山包围，没有一丝凉风可以吹进帕果帕果。

“在我们那些岛上，”戴维森夫人用她刺耳的音调继续说道，“我们已经几乎将拉瓦拉瓦全部消灭了。有几个老人还在穿，但也就那么多了。女人们全都穿上了长罩衣[2]，男人们则穿长裤和汗衫。我们刚在那里驻扎时，戴维森在一次报告中讲到，这些岛上的居民不可能彻底成为基督教徒，除非让每个十岁以上的男孩都穿上裤子。”

但是戴维森夫人用她那鸟似的眼睛轻快地扫了几眼港口上空飘浮着的厚重乌云。几滴雨落了下来。

“我们最好避避雨。”她说。

于是他们随着人群拥进了一个波纹铁皮盖的大棚子，瓢泼大雨顿时倾盆而下。他们在那里站了些时候，随后戴维森先生过来加入了他们。整个旅途中，他对麦克费尔夫妇一直彬彬有礼，不过他不像他妻子那样善于交际，所以他大部分时间都用来读书了。他是个沉默寡言，有点儿阴沉的人，你会觉得，他的亲和完全是基督教义强加给他的一份职责。他天性矜持，甚至可以说是孤僻。他那副相貌也是独一无二的。他的身材高削，长长的四肢松松垮垮地连接在躯体上，脸颊凹陷，颧骨却高得古怪；你会惊讶地发现，虽然他面色惨白，但嘴唇却特别丰满性感。他留着长长的头发。他那双乌黑的眼睛，深陷在眼窝里，又大又悲凉；他的手指又粗又长，显得手掌非常好看，给他平添了几分力量之感。不过，他身上最引人注目的地方在于他总是给人一种强抑怒火的感觉。这一点实在让人印象深刻，甚至有些隐隐不安。他不是一个能够深交的男人。

他现在给大伙带来了坏消息：在卡纳卡人[3]中爆发的一种严重且经常致人死命的麻疹病已经传播到了这座岛上，他们即将搭乘的双桅帆船的船员中已经发现了一例病患。患者已被送上岸，目前正在医院的防疫禁区，但有电报从阿皮亚发来说，直到确保没有其他船员被感染为止，这条帆船不得进入港口。

“这意味着我们必须在这里驻留至少十天。”

“可我急需抵达阿皮亚呀！”麦克费尔医生说道。

“那没用。如果船上没有人再感染，双桅帆船可以恢复航行，但也只能承载白人旅客，而当地人将在未来三个月全部禁行。”

“这里有宾馆吗？”麦克费尔夫人问。

戴维森低声笑了笑。

“没有。”

“那我们怎么办？”

“我一直在跟总督交涉。沿海有个商人在出租房屋，我的建议是，等雨停了，我们就到那儿去，看看该怎么办。别指望会多舒服，如果我们能有张床可以睡觉，不用风餐露宿就该谢天谢地了。”

但雨丝毫没有停止的迹象，最后他们只好撑着雨伞、披上雨衣出发了。岛上没有城镇，只有一群办公楼，一两间商店，在街道后面的椰树林和大蕉丛里有几座当地人的房子。他们要找的房子距码头大约五分钟的路程。这是一座两层木架构房屋，每层都带有宽阔的阳台，屋顶由波纹铁皮做成。房东霍恩是个混血儿，娶了个当地人，生了一群棕皮肤小孩。他在房子的一楼开了家商店，出售罐头食品和棉布。他领他们看的房间几乎没有任何家具，麦克费尔夫妇的房间除了一张破破烂烂的旧床，上面挂着皱巴巴的蚊帐，一把快要散架的椅子和脸盆架之外，再无其他。他们心灰意冷地四下打量了一下。瓢泼大雨哗哗地下个不停。

“不是真正需要的行李我就不打开了。”麦克费尔夫人说。

戴维森夫人一面打开旅行皮包，一面走了进来。她是个非常活泼的人，为人机敏，阴雨的环境丝毫没有影响到她。

“你要是听我劝告的话，现在就拿根针和线把蚊帐补一补，”她说，“否则，今晚你别想合眼。”

“蚊子有那么猖獗吗？”麦克费尔医生问。

“现在正是它们猖獗的季节。当你在阿皮亚被邀请到总督府参加晚会时，你就会看到女士们都拿到一个枕套用来将她们的——她们的下肢裹住。”

“我希望雨能停一会儿，”麦克费尔夫人说，“如果能出太阳的话，我就更有心思把这里弄舒服一些了。”

“哦，如果你要等那么一天，你可要等上好长一段时间。帕果帕果差不多是太平洋地区雨水最多的地方。你看，那些山丘，还有港湾，它们都很招雨水，并且不管怎么说，一年中的这个季节下雨也是正常的。”

戴维森夫人看了看麦克费尔，又看了看他妻子。两人不知所措地各自站在房间的一端，一副失魂落魄的样子。她噘了噘嘴，她知道她必须要帮他们一把了。像这种软弱的人真让她没耐心，但她忍不住要把一切都收拾得有条不紊，这已经成了她的天性。

“来，你把针和线给我，我帮你补蚊帐，你接着弄你的行李。一点钟吃午饭。麦克费尔医生，你最好到码头去看看你那些重行李有没有被放到干燥的地方，你知道当地人都是些什么人，他们很可能会把行李存放在一直漏雨的地方。”

医生再次穿上雨衣下了楼。霍恩先生正站在门口跟他们刚才乘坐的那艘船上的舵手和一个他在甲板上见过几次的二等舱乘客交谈。舵手是个个子小、身材干瘪的男人，全身污垢不堪。医生经过时，他冲他点了点头。

“治疗麻疹可不是什么好活儿，医生。”他说，“我知道你的住处已经安排妥当了。”

麦克费尔医生觉得他有些放肆，不过他是胆怯之人，一般不轻易动怒。

“是的，我们在楼上有了个房间。”

“汤普森小姐跟你同去阿皮亚，所以我把她带到这里来了。”

舵手用他的大拇指指了指站在他旁边的女子。她大约二十七岁的样子，体态丰满，长得虽然有些俗气，但还算漂亮。她身穿白色连衣裙，戴着一顶硕大的白帽子，穿着白棉长筒袜的胖乎乎的小腿从小山羊皮皮面的白色长靴子的顶端鼓出来。她逢迎地朝麦克费尔笑了笑。

“这小伙子想敲诈我，那么小的房间一天居然要一美元半！”她用嘶哑的声音说道。

“我跟你说，乔，她是我的一个朋友。”舵手说，“她最多就能付一美元，你必须得照她说的办。”

商人长得圆润，人也圆滑，他默默地微笑着。

“好吧，斯旺先生，既然你这样说，我想想该怎么办吧。我会跟我夫人说说，看看能不能打个折扣。”

“别跟我来那一套。”汤普森小姐说道，“我们现在就要搬进来，房间一天一美元，不能再多了。”

麦克费尔笑了笑，他很钦佩她这种厚颜无耻的砍价方式，他自己是那种人家要多少就给多少的人，他宁愿多付钱也不愿讨价还价。商人叹了口气。

“好吧，看在斯旺先生的分儿上，我认了。”

“这还差不多。”汤普森小姐道，“斯旺先生，进来喝杯烈酒吧，那个小旅行包你如果带过来了，里面有上好的黑麦威士忌。医生，你也一起来吧。”

“哦，我想我还是不去了，谢谢。”他回答道，“我得去看看我们的行李安置妥当了没。”

他走出门，踏进了雨中。雨正大片大片地从港口横扫进来，对岸全都模糊不清了。一路上他碰见了两三个只穿着拉瓦拉瓦、撑着把大伞的当地人，他们身姿优雅、优哉游哉地走在路上，躯干挺得笔直。当他从旁边经过时，他们都冲他微笑，并用一种奇怪的语言向他问好。

等他回来时已经临近午饭时间，他们的饭菜已经被放在了房东家的客厅里。设计这间客厅时就没打算用来住宿，只是为了装装体面，因此房间里散发着一股霉味，气氛阴郁。一套轧花长毛绒沙发整齐地绕墙而立，为了防苍蝇，天花板上贴着黄色薄纸，正中央悬挂着一盏镀金枝形吊灯。戴维森没有来。

“我知道他去拜访总督了。”戴维森夫人说，“我想总督留下他共进午餐了。”

一个当地小女孩端上来一盘油炸肉饼。过了一会儿，商人便走过来看了看他们要的饭菜是否已经上齐。

“我看到我们有了一位新房客，霍恩先生。”麦克费尔医生说道。

“她就租了一个房间，就这样。”商人回答，“她自己解决伙食。”

他奉承地看了看桌上的两位女士。

“我让她住在楼下，这样就不会碍事了，她不会给你们带来任何麻烦的。”

“她原先也在船上吗？”麦克费尔夫人问。

“是的，夫人，她在二等舱，去阿皮亚，有份出纳员的工作在等着她。”

“哦！”

商人离开后，麦克费尔说：“我想她一个人在房间里吃饭一定觉得很乏味。”

“如果她坐的是二等舱，我想她还是就在房间里吃吧。”戴维森夫人说，“真不知道她会是哪种人。”

“舵手带她来时，我正好在那里，她的名字叫汤普森。”

“该不会是昨天晚上跟舵手跳舞的那个女人吧？”戴维森夫人问。

“肯定是了。”麦克费尔夫人说，“当时我还想她是谁呢，我觉得她是个放荡的女人。”

“不是什么好货色。”戴维森夫人说。

他们开始谈论其他话题。午饭后，因为早上起得早，他们觉得有些倦意，便各自分开去午休了。醒来后，尽管天还是灰蒙蒙的，乌云低垂，但雨已经停了，于是他们沿着美国人修建的海湾公路散了会儿步。

当他们回来后，发现戴维森也刚刚进来。

“我们可能要在这里待上两周。”他气急败坏地说道，“我已经就此跟总督争论过了，但他说没有办法。”

“戴维森先生只是渴望赶紧回去工作。”他妻子焦虑地扫了他一眼说道。

“我们已经离开一年了，”他在阳台上来回踱着，“我的任务是管理当地的传教士们，我非常担心他们会放任自流。他们都是好人，我说这话绝不是在斥责他们，他们敬畏上帝，虔诚，是些真正的基督徒——他们对基督的信仰让我们国家许多所谓的基督徒脸红——但遗憾的是，他们干劲儿不足，他们可以抗争一两次，但不会一直抗争下去。如果你交给当地传教士一项任务，不管他看起来是多么叫人放心，但终有一天你会发现他悄悄地胡作非为起来。”

戴维森先生静静地站在那里。他身材高挑消瘦，苍白的脸上一双大眼闪烁着，是一个令人印象深刻的人物。他的诚挚从他热情的姿势和低沉清晰的嗓音中尽显出来。

“我想我有一大堆工作要做。我应当采取行动了，必须立即行动起来。如果树木已经腐烂，它就应被砍倒，然后投到火里去。”

吃完下午茶之后——那是他们一天中的最后一餐，已是傍晚。他们坐在阴冷的客厅里，女士们在忙着针线活儿，麦克费尔医生正用烟斗抽着烟，传教士则在向他们讲述自己在岛上的工作。

“我们刚到那里时，他们毫无罪恶感。”他说，“他们一个接一个地违反戒律，根本不知道这样做是有罪的。我想我工作中最困难的部分就是给那些当地人灌输罪恶感。”

麦克费尔夫妇已经知道，戴维森在遇到他妻子之前在所罗门群岛工作过五年。她之前在中国当传教士，两人相识于波士顿——当时他们都利用部分假期参加了一次传教士大会。婚后，他们被派到了这些岛屿上，工作至今。

在他们跟戴维森先生进行的所有谈话过程中，他身上有一种特质一直在熠熠闪光，那就是这个男人百折不挠的勇气。他是一名医学传教士，随时都有可能被叫到群岛中任何一个岛上去。雨季中的太平洋动辄狂风暴雨，这种天气连捕鲸船都觉得不是那么安全，不敢航行，但他却经常驾着一叶轻舟出海，所以危险性极高。碰到有人生病或遭遇事故，他从未犹豫过。他曾多次彻夜失联，戴维森夫人也不止一次以为他失踪了。

“有时我求他不要去了，”她说，“或者至少等到天气稳定下来再说，但他从来不听。他这个人很固执，一旦下定了决心，什么都不能使他动摇。”

“如果我自己都感到害怕，那我怎能要求当地人相信上帝呢？”戴维森大声说道，“我决不会害怕，决不。他们知道如果他们在苦难中召唤我，只要人力所及，我就必然会去。我是在为上帝尽责，你觉得他会抛弃我吗？风是遵照他的圣谕而吹拂，浪花亦是按照他的旨意而汹涌。”

麦克费尔医生是个胆小之人。他从未习惯战壕上方的枪林弹雨，在前线急救站做手术时，由于要拼命控制住颤抖的双手，大把的汗水从他的额间渗出，模糊了眼镜。他望着传教士，身子微微抖动了一下。

“我希望我能够说我从未畏惧过。”他说。

“我希望你可以说你信奉上帝。”另一人回应道。

但出于某种缘由，那个晚上，传教士的思绪回到了他和妻子初到岛上的那些日子。

“有时，戴维森夫人和我会相视而泣，泪水从脸颊上滚滚落下。我们夜以继日地工作，从未停止，但却似乎没有任何进展。那时要是没有她在身边，我真不知道该做些什么。当我心灰意冷时，当我几近绝望时，是她给了我勇气和希望。”

戴维森夫人低头注视着手中的针线活儿，瘦削的脸颊微微泛红，两只手微微颤抖了一下，没有开口——她没有把握该说些什么。

“没有人帮助我们。我们孤身在外，和自己的同胞相隔数千里，四周一片黑暗。当我筋疲力尽、心力交瘁时，她就将手中的工作搁置一旁，拿起《圣经》，为我诵读，直到平静降临到我的身上，如同睡意降临到孩童的眼皮上一样。最后，她合上书说，‘不管他们自己如何，我们都要拯救他们。’我对上帝的信仰又一次变坚定了，我回答道，‘是的，在上帝的帮助下，我要拯救他们，我必须拯救他们。’”

他走向餐桌，站在桌子前面，仿佛那是一张诵经台。

“你要知道，他们的天性是如此堕落，以至于他们几乎无法看清自己的邪恶。我们不得不从他们习以为常的行为中定义出什么是罪恶。我们不仅把通奸、说谎、偷窃定义为罪恶，还把裸露身体、跳舞、不去教堂也定义为罪恶。我还把女孩袒胸露乳、男子不穿裤子也定义为罪恶。”

“你怎么做到的？”麦克费尔医生不无诧异地问。

“我制定了罚款制度。显然要让人们意识到一个行为是有罪的唯一途径就是如果他们做出了这个行为，就要惩罚他们。如果他们不到教堂来，我就罚他们的款，如果他们跳舞，我也罚他们的款，如果他们穿着不当，我也要罚款。我有一张罚款表，违反任何一项都要罚钱或罚苦力。最后，我终于让他们明白了。”

“不过他们从不拒绝交钱吗？”

“他们怎么敢不交？”传教士道。

“试图站出来跟戴维森先生抗衡的，必定是个胆大包天的人。”他的妻子绷紧了嘴唇说道。

麦克费尔医生看着戴维森先生，眼睛里满是困惑。他听到的话让他感到惊讶，不过他不愿把自己的反对意见表达出来。

“切记，我最后的撒手锏就是将他们从教堂里开除。”

“他们在意吗？”

戴维森笑了笑，轻轻摩挲着他的手掌。

“那样他们就无法销售他们的干椰子肉了，当人们打了鱼，他们也分不到应有的一份，这就差不多意味着他们会被饿死。是的，他们非常在意。”

“给他讲讲弗雷德·奥尔森的事。”戴维森夫人补充道。

传教士兴奋地注视着麦克费尔医生。

“弗雷德·奥尔森是一个丹麦商人，他已经在岛上待了很多年了。他跟其他商人一样非常有钱。我们刚到岛上时，他不是很开心。你知道的，他在那儿想干什么就干什么。他想付什么给当地人来收购他们的干椰子肉就付什么，他会用货物和威士忌跟他们交换干椰子肉。他娶了一个当地人做妻子，但他明目张胆地背叛了她，另外他还是个酒鬼。我给了他机会来纠正自己的行为，但他根本不听，还嘲笑我。”

当说最后几个字的时候，戴维森的声音降得很低，然后他沉默了一两分钟，这种沉默让人心情沉重、不安。

“两年后，他就破产了，二十五年来的积蓄荡然无存。我搞得他倾家荡产了，最终他不得不来找我，像个乞丐一样，恳求我给他一笔回悉尼的路费。”

“我真希望你能看看他来见戴维森先生时的样子。”传教士的妻子说道，“他曾是一个帅气强壮的人，人长得肥硕，声音洪亮，不过现在他整个人都小了一半，全身颤巍巍的。他突然间就变成了一个老人。”

戴维森出神地凝视着外面的夜色。又下雨了。

一阵声音突然从楼下传来，戴维森转过身疑惑地望向妻子。这是留声机尖锐又喧嚣的声音，呼哧呼哧地响着音节交错的乐曲。

“那是什么？”他问。

戴维森夫人把夹鼻眼镜按了按，使之更稳固了些。

“二等舱的一名乘客也住在这里，我想声音是从她那里发出来的。”

他们沉默地听了一会儿，很快又听到了跳舞声。然后，音乐声停下了，他们听到了瓶塞的砰砰声和欢快的说话声。

“我猜她是在给船上的朋友举办告别会。”麦克费尔医生说，“船十二点出发，是吧？”

戴维森没有回答，但他看了看表。

“你准备好了吗？”他问妻子。

她站起身，折好了手里的针线活儿。

“是的，我想是这样。”她回答。

“现在上床有点儿太早了，是吗？”医生说。

“我们还有很多东西要读。”戴维森夫人解释道，“不管在哪里，晚上睡觉前我们都要读一章《圣经》，并根据注释做些研究，然后再彻底地讨论一番，这对心智来说是个再好不过的训练。”

两对夫妇互道了晚安。只剩下麦克费尔夫妇了，有两三分钟的时间两人都没说话。

“我想我还是去把扑克拿过来吧。”医生最后说。

麦克费尔夫人充满疑虑地看着他。跟戴维森夫妇的谈话让她有些不安，但她又不大乐意说她觉得他们最好还是别玩扑克的好，以防戴维森夫妇随时都可能过来。麦克费尔医生把扑克拿了过来，她看着他把牌洗好——虽然心里隐隐约约有些负罪感。楼下的狂欢声则从未消停。

第二天天气已经晴好，在帕果帕果滞留两周已成定局，麦克费尔夫妇决定随遇而安。他们步行到了码头，从行李箱中取了几本书。医生拜访了海军医院的外科主任医师，然后跟他一起查了病房。他们还在总督府留下了名片。路上他们还碰到了汤普森小姐。医生脱帽行礼，她大声欢快地回了他一句“早上好，医生！”，她的穿着与昨天相同，一袭白裙，白亮的高跟靴，她那胖乎乎的小腿从靴筒顶部鼓了出来，显得与周围的异国风情有些格格不入。

“我觉得她穿得太不得体了。”麦克费尔夫人说道，“在我看来，她真是太不堪入目了。”

当他们回到住处时，她正在阳台上跟商人深色皮肤的孩子们玩耍。

“去跟她说句话。”麦克费尔医生小声对妻子说，“她独自一人待在这儿，对她不理不睬有些不厚道。”

麦克费尔夫人有些迟疑，但她习惯了按照丈夫的要求去做。

“我想咱们都是这里的房客。”她走过去，有些傻里傻气地开口道。

“被困在这么个小镇，真是太糟糕了，是不是？”汤普森小姐回答道，“他们跟我说，我能在这里有间房住已经很幸运了。我不知道自己怎么会住在一个土著人家里，可有些人不得不这样做，真搞不懂他们为什么不在这里开家旅馆。”

她们又交流了几句。汤普森小姐是个大嗓门，说起话来喋喋不休，显然挺乐意闲聊的。不过麦克费尔夫人却不擅长闲聊，不一会儿她就说：

“哦，我想我们该上楼了。”

薄暮时分，当他们坐下来喝下午茶时，戴维森走进来说：

“我看到楼下那个女人那里坐着两三个水手。真不知道她是怎么跟他们混熟的。”

“她这种人不可能有多讲究。”戴维森夫人道。

度过了无所事事、漫无目的的一天后，他们都感到有些腻烦。

“要是天天如此地待上两周，我真不知道我们最后会是什么感觉。”麦克费尔医生说。

“我们只能把一天的时间分配给不同的活动。”传教士答道，“我要拿出几个钟头来学习，几个钟头来锻炼，无论是雨天还是晴天——在雨季里你根本没法注意天晴与否——另外，我还要用几个钟头来娱乐。”

麦克费尔医生疑虑地看了看他的伙伴，戴维森的计划让他感到了压力。这次他们吃的还是油炸肉饼，这似乎是厨师唯一会做的一道菜。然后楼下留声机的声音又响了起来。戴维森一听到这个声音就紧张了起来，但他什么也没说。接着，男人们的声音飘了上来。汤普森小姐的客人们唱起了一首著名歌曲，不一会儿他们便听到她那沙哑而高亢的嗓音也夹杂在其中，喊叫声、大笑声响成一片。楼上试图进行交谈的四个人，不由自主地停了下来，去听楼下酒杯的叮当声，以及拖拽椅子发出的刺耳的响声。显然，又来了许多人。汤普森小姐在举行一场晚会。

“真不知道她是怎么把他们招来的。”麦克费尔夫人突然打断了传教士和她丈夫正在进行的医学方面的谈话，说道。

这句话表明了她的思绪飘荡到了哪里，戴维森脸上的抽动也证明了尽管他嘴里谈论的是科学问题，但心思已经同麦克费尔夫人走向了一处。医生讲述着他在佛兰德斯前线的从医经历，戴维森甚感无趣，突然间，他大叫一声站了起来。

“怎么啦，阿尔弗雷德？”戴维森夫人问。

“一定没错！我竟然从未想到，她是从伊韦雷来的。”

“不可能。”

“她是在火鲁奴奴[4]上的船，这是明摆着的。她到这里来是做生意。这里！”

他带着满腔怒火说出最后两个字。

“伊韦雷是哪里？”麦克费尔夫人问。

他把忧郁的目光转向她，声音因恐惧而颤抖了。

“是火鲁奴奴的疫区，红灯区——人类文明的耻辱。”

伊韦雷地处火鲁奴奴的城市边缘。你自港口起穿过几条黑漆漆的小巷，走过一座摇摇晃晃的桥梁，就会来到一条坑坑洼洼、沟壑纵横的荒芜小道上，然后你的周围就会突然明亮起来。道路两旁设有停车区，还有花里胡哨、灯火通明的酒吧，每个里面都传来嘈杂的自动钢琴声，还有理发店和烟草店。空气中流淌着一股躁动的气息，让人感觉好像随处都可以寻欢作乐。这条道路将伊韦雷一分为二，你随便向左或向右拐进一条狭窄小巷都能发现自己身处这个区域之中。这里有成排的小房屋，整齐干净地涂着绿漆，房屋间的道路宽阔笔直，布置得像一座花园城市；不过，在这规整体面、洁净有序的外观之下，却给人以一种讽刺的恐怖印象，因为在寻欢逐爱上没有任何地方比这里更自成体系，有章可循。道路上路灯稀疏，如果没有从小房屋开着的窗户里透出的光亮，路上简直一片漆黑。男人们在此踟蹰，窥视着坐在窗前的女人们。她们有的在读书，有的在做针线活儿，大多时候都不会理会这些过客。这些过客同这些女人一样来自世界各国，他们中有美国人，港口船上的水手，炮艇士兵，喝得醉醺醺的酒鬼，还有驻扎在岛上的兵团里的士兵，黑人白人都有，还有三三两两结伴而行的日本人，还有夏威夷人、穿长袍的中国人，以及戴着滑稽帽子的菲律宾人。他们全都沉默不语，似乎被压抑住了。欲望是叫人伤心的东西。

“这是太平洋地区最骇人听闻的丑事。”戴维森言辞激烈地叫道，“传教士多年来一直在鼓动反对，最后当地报纸开始报道这件事，但警方拒绝介入。你知道他们的观点。他们说罪恶是不可避免的，因此最好的办法就是集中管理。而实际情况是，他们被收买了！被收买了！他们被酒吧主给收买了，被暴徒收买了，那些女人自己也给了他们好处。最终他们只能撤出了。”

“船在火鲁奴奴停泊时，我在当地报纸上读到过此事。”麦克费尔医生说。

“伊韦雷，连同它的邪恶和耻辱一起，就在我们到达的那一天被连根拔除了，所有人都受到了司法审判。不知道为何我没有立马看出那个女人是哪种货色。”

“你这么一说，”麦克费尔夫人说，“我倒想起来，我看到她是在起锚前的几分钟上的船。我记得我当时还想，她可真会卡时间。”

“她怎么敢到这里来！”戴维森愤怒地喊道，“我决不会姑息这件事。”

他大步向门口走去。

“你要去干什么？”麦克费尔问道。

“你认为我要干什么？我要去阻止这件事，我不能让这座房子变成，变成一个——”

他在寻求一个合适的字眼，以免冒犯了两位女士的耳朵。他的目光变得凌厉，苍白的脸色因情绪的爆发而更显苍白。

“听起来楼下那里好像有三四名男子，”医生说，“现在过去你不觉得有些莽撞吗？”

传教士鄙夷地看了他一眼，一句话没说便冲出了房门。

“如果你认为戴维森先生会因担忧个人安危而怯于履行自己的职责，那你对他就太不了解了。”戴维森夫人说道。

她高高的颧骨微微发红，双手交握着，焦急地坐在那里倾听楼下即将发生的一切。他们都在侧耳听着，先是听到戴维森嘎吱嘎吱冲下木楼梯的声音，接着他砰的一声摔开了门。歌声戛然而止，但留声机还继续播放着刺耳低俗的乐曲。他们听到了戴维森的说话声，接着是某个重物落地的声音，音乐停止了。他把留声机狠狠地摔到了地上。接着他们又听到戴维森的声音，但听不清在说什么，然后是汤普森小姐的声音，又大又尖，再然后便是嘈杂的喧闹声，就好像几个人同时声嘶力竭地叫喊着。戴维森夫人微微倒吸了一口气，把两只手攥得更紧了。麦克费尔医生犹豫地将目光从她身上扫向他的妻子。他不想到楼下去，但不知道她们是否希望他去。而后传来了一阵类似扭打的响声，现在声音更加清晰了。或许是戴维森被赶出了房间，门被重重地关上了。片刻的沉寂之后，他们又一次听到了戴维森上楼的声音。他回到了自己房间。

“我想我最好去看看他。”戴维森夫人说道。

她起身走出了房间。

“如果你需要我，尽管打电话。”麦克费尔夫人说。当戴维森夫人离开后，她又说：“我希望他没受伤。”

“他干吗要多管闲事呢？”麦克费尔医生道。

两人默默地坐了一两分钟，而后都大感吃惊，因为留声机又响起来了，挑衅一般，嘲弄的语调嘶哑地吼着一首下流歌曲的歌词。

第二天，戴维森夫人面色苍白，身形疲惫，她抱怨说头疼，整个人看上去苍老而委顿。她跟麦克费尔夫人说，传教士彻夜未眠，异常焦虑地度过了一个晚上后，凌晨五点就起床出了门。他被人泼了啤酒，衣服都弄脏了，散发着臭味。但当戴维森夫人谈及汤普森小姐时，她眼中涌现出了一股阴沉沉的怒火。

“她嘲弄了戴维森先生，总有一天她会为此感到懊悔的。”她说，“戴维森先生有一颗慈悲的心，陷入困境的人们去找他，无不得到安慰，但他嫉恶如仇。如果有谁激起了他正义的怒火，他将变得非常可怕。”

“哦，他会做什么呢？”麦克费尔夫人问。

“我不知道，不管怎样，这个世界上没有任何东西能够让我甘愿落入她那种境地。”

麦克费尔夫人不寒而栗，这个小个子女人举手投足之间流露出来的自信和得意着实令人惊讶。那天早上，她们一起出了门，肩并肩地走下了楼。汤普森小姐的门是开着的，她们看到她穿着一件破旧睡衣，正在用平底锅做饭。

“早上好！”她喊道，“戴维森先生今天早上好些了吗？”

她们昂着头默默地从她身边走过，就好像她不存在一般。然而当她发出一阵讽刺的大笑声时，她们的脸一下子红了，戴维森夫人猛地转过身。

“你竟然还敢跟我说话！”她厉声叫道，“如果你敢羞辱我，我就叫人把你从这里赶出去。”

“喂，是我邀请戴维森先生来我这儿的吗？”

“别理她。”麦克费尔夫人小声地匆匆说道。

她们继续往前走，直到听不到她说话了才停下来。

“她真是厚颜无耻，厚颜无耻！”戴维森夫人火冒三丈。

愤怒简直要让她窒息了。

回去路上，她们又碰到她正慢悠悠地迈着步子向港口走去。她一身盛装，她那插着俗艳花朵的大白帽子本身就是一种挑衅！从她们身边经过时，她欢快地冲着她们大声叫喊，当这两位女士对此报以冷目时，旁边站着的几个美国水手不由得咧嘴大笑起来。她们刚一进门，雨又落了下来。

“我想她的漂亮衣服可要完蛋喽！”戴维森夫人很是幸灾乐祸地说道。

她们的午餐吃到一半的时候，戴维森才回来。他全身都湿透了，但是不愿意换衣服，只是一声不吭地闷坐着，草草吃了一口饭后，便开始凝视着外面斜飘的雨水。当戴维森夫人告诉他她们两次碰到汤普森小姐的遭遇时，戴维森也没有回话，但他愈加紧蹙的眉头表明他已听到了。

“你不觉得我们应该让霍恩先生把她赶走吗？”戴维森夫人问道，“我们不能让她羞辱我们。”

“不过她好像没别的地方可去了。”麦克费尔说。

“她可以跟当地人一起住。”

“像这种天气，当地人的小屋住起来一定很不舒服。”

“我在那种小屋住过多年。”传教士说。

一个矮小的当地女孩端进来一盘炸香蕉——这是他们每天都要吃的甜点，戴维森转过身面向她。

“去问问汤普森小姐何时方便，我要见见她。”他说道。

女孩羞怯地点了点头，走了出去。

“你见她干什么，阿尔弗雷德？”他妻子问。

“见她是我的职责所在，在我给尽她一切机会之前，我是不会采取行动的。”

“你还不知道她是哪种人吗？她会羞辱你的。”

“让她羞辱我吧，让她对我吐口水好了，她跟所有人一样有着不腐不朽的灵魂，我要尽我所能拯救她。”

戴维森夫人耳朵里还回响着那个贱人的嘲笑声。

“她太过分了！”

“过分到无法接受上帝的慈爱吗？”戴维森的眼睛顿时明亮了，声音也变得温和起来，“绝非如此。恶人的罪孽可能比地狱还深，但耶稣基督的慈爱依然能够降临到他们身上。”

女孩带回了消息。

“汤普森小姐深感荣幸，她说只要不是‘营业’时间，她随时恭候戴维森牧师大驾光临。”

几个人听了之后都沉默着没说一句话，麦克费尔医生迅速收敛了浮现在嘴角上的笑意，他知道如果他觉得汤普森小姐的厚颜无耻很好玩的话，他妻子会生他的气的。

他们默默地吃完了午饭。饭后两位女士起身拿起了针线活儿，麦克费尔夫人开始织另外一条羊毛围巾——从战争爆发到现在她已经织了无数条。医生点上了烟斗，而戴维森却仍坐在椅子上，两眼空洞地注视着桌子。最后他站起身，一声不吭地走出了房间。他们听到他下了楼，又听到当他敲门后汤普森小姐那声挑衅的“进来”。他在那里待了有一个小时了。麦克费尔医生注视着外面的大雨，神经渐渐紧张起来。这里的雨水跟英国那飘飘洒洒落入大地的柔和雨水不同，它冷酷得让人有些害怕，你能从这些雨水里感受到大自然原始力量的恶劣性质。这里的雨水并不是倾盆而下，而是决堤似的，就像一股直接从天空迸发的洪水般，飞流直下，打在波形铁的房顶上，持续不断地啪啪作响，令人抓狂，好似雨水也有自己的愤怒一样。有时，你会感觉如果雨水再不停歇，你就忍不住要尖叫了，随之你又会突然变得软弱无力，仿佛你的骨头霎时间都松软了，这时你便会苦不堪言、绝望透顶。

传教士回来了，麦克费尔转过头看着他，两个女人也抬起了头。

“我已经仁至义尽了，我劝诫她悔罪自新。她是个邪恶的女人。”

他停顿了一下，麦克费尔医生看到他两眼黯淡，那张苍白的脸紧紧地绷着，神色严峻。

“现在我要拿起那条皮鞭了，那条主耶稣曾用来驱赶圣殿里的高利贷者和货币兑换商的皮鞭。”

他在房间里来回踱步，嘴唇紧紧抿着，黝黑的眉毛拧成了一团。

“即使她逃到天涯海角，我也不会放过她。”

他突然转过身，大步流星地走出了房间。他们听到他又下楼去了。

“他要干什么去？”麦克费尔夫人问。

“不知道。”戴维森夫人把夹鼻眼镜摘下来擦了擦，“他履行圣职时我从不过问。”

她轻轻地叹了口气。

“怎么啦？”

“他总把自己搞得筋疲力尽，从不知道放松自己。”

他的行为产生的第一个结果，麦克费尔医生是从租给他们房间的混血商人那儿得知的。医生从店铺门口经过时被他叫住，然后他走了出来，站在门廊边跟医生说话，肥胖的脸上忧虑重重。

“戴维森牧师责怪我把房间租给了汤普森小姐，”他说，“不过，我当时根本就不知道她是什么人。人们来问我是否能租给他们一间房，我所关心的只有他们是否付得起房租。而她提前预付了我一周的房租。”

麦克费尔医生不想承担什么责任。

“不管怎么说，房子是你的，你能让我们住进来，我们已经感激不尽。”

霍恩满腹疑虑地看着他，他还没把握麦克费尔在多大程度上站在传教士一边。

“传教士都是一伙儿的，”他吞吞吐吐地说，“如果他们要对付一个商人，那他可能就只有关门大吉，卷起铺盖走人。”

“他要你把她赶走吗？”

“没有。他说只要她规规矩矩的，就不会要求我那样做。他说为了公平起见，我保证她不会再接待客人，我刚去她那里告诉她了。”

“她什么反应？”

“她把我骂了一顿。”

房东的两条腿在破旧的帆布裤子里扭动着，他已经发现汤普森小姐是个难缠的主顾。

“唔，好吧，我猜她还是会走的。要是一个客人都没有，我想她是不会留在这里的。”

“她没地方可去。只有一家当地宾馆，而眼下当地人是不会接待她的，传教士们目前也不会惩罚她。”

麦克费尔医生望着外面哗哗的大雨。

“啊，别指望放晴了，没用的。”

晚上当他们坐在客厅里时，戴维森谈起了他刚上大学时的那些日子。当时由于没有生活来源，他只能靠在假期干些零活来完成学业。这时楼下静悄悄的，汤普森小姐正一个人待在自己的小房间里。突然留声机开始响起来，她打开它只是为了挑衅，为了掩饰她的孤独，但是那儿没人跟唱，只有机器发出的悲凉的调子，就像是有人在求救。戴维森并未理会，他的长篇轶事刚讲到一半，他面不改色地继续讲了下去。留声机继续响着，唱片放了一张又一张，看上去就好像夜晚的静寂让汤普森小姐惴惴不安。这个晚上闷热得让人透不过气来，麦克费尔夫妇上床后迟迟无法入眠。他们睁着眼并排躺着，听着蚊帐外面蚊子冷酷的嗡嗡声。

“什么声音？”麦克费尔夫人突然低声问。

他们听到一个人的说话声——是戴维森的声音——透过木制隔板传了过来。语调平稳，语气诚恳、坚定，他正在大声祈祷，为汤普森小姐的灵魂祈祷。

两三天过去了。现在当他们在路上碰到汤普森小姐时，她不再用嘲讽的口吻问候他们或冲他们微笑了，而是把头仰得高高的，涂脂抹粉的脸上看上去有些郁郁不乐，眉头紧锁，就好像完全没有看见他们一样。商人告诉麦克费尔，她曾试着到别处寻找住处，但没成功。每天晚上，她用留声机一张张地播放着唱片，现在看来那显然不过是强作欢颜罢了。唱片中的拉格泰姆音乐[5]带有一种令人崩溃、心碎的节奏，就像是一种绝望的舞步。礼拜天她又开始播放音乐时，戴维森请霍恩立即去阻止她，因为这天是安息日！唱片从留声机上拿掉了，整栋房子都安静下来，只有雨水打在铁皮屋顶上发出的连续不断的啪啪声。

“我觉得她有点儿抓狂了，”第二天商人对麦克费尔说，“她不知道戴维森先生究竟在干什么，这令她感到惶恐。”

那天早上，麦克费尔瞥了她一眼，他突然意识到她那倨傲的神情已经变了，脸上露出了一种走投无路的神情。混血商人朝他斜瞥了一眼。

“我想你也不知道戴维森先生究竟在做什么吧？”他大胆地问道。

“是的，我不知道。”

霍恩会问他这个问题真是不可思议，因为他自己也有这种想法，传教士正在暗自谋划着。他的感觉是，传教士正在精心地、有条不紊而又出其不意地在那个女人周围布网，等一切就绪就会突然把绳子收紧。

“他让我告诉她，”商人说，“如果，任何时候她想要见他，只需要发出邀请，他就会赴邀。”

“你告诉她后她怎么说？”

“她什么也没说，我也没等她回话。我只说了他要我传达的话后就走了。我想她可能要哭了。”

“我坚信，那种孤独让她心烦意乱。”医生说，“还有这场足以让任何人变得神经质的雨。”他暴躁地继续说道，“这个鬼地方的雨难道不停了吗？”

“雨季总是下个没完没了，今年的降水已经达到了三百英寸。你知道，这是港湾地形造成的，整个太平洋的降水好像都被吸引来了。”

“这该死的港湾地形！”医生道。

他挠了挠被蚊子叮咬的地方，觉得很想发泄一通。一旦雨过天晴、太阳出来，这个地方又会变得跟蒸笼一般，酷热潮湿，闷得让人喘不过气来，这时你就会产生一种奇怪的感觉，似乎万物生长都夹杂着一种野蛮的暴力。素以孩子般的快乐和单纯闻名的当地人在这个时候也会因为他们的文身和染发而看起来多了几分邪恶。当他们光着脚板啪嗒啪嗒地紧跟在你身后时，你会本能地转过身，你会觉得他们随时都有可能冲上来，将一把长匕首刺进你的肩胛骨之间。你摸不清他们那双间距很开的眼睛里潜藏着怎样的阴暗念头。他们有点儿像画在神庙墙壁上的古埃及人，散发着极其古老的恐怖气息。

传教士来了又走了。他很忙，但麦克费尔夫妇并不知道他在忙些什么。霍恩告诉医生他天天去见总督，有一次戴维森还提到了总督。

“他看起来好像已经下了很大的决心，”传教士说，“不过当涉及实质问题时，他又变得没了魄力。”

“我想那意味着他不会完全照着你的意思办。”医生开玩笑道。

传教士没有笑。

“我希望他做正确的事，这个是不需要人劝的。”

“不过，是非对错因人而异。”

“要是一个人的脚患上了坏疽病还犹豫着要不要截肢，你会对他有耐心吗？”

“坏疽倒是一种实质问题。”

“那么罪恶呢？”

戴维森在做什么没过多久就清楚了。四人刚刚吃过午饭，尚未各自去午睡——酷热的天气迫使两位女士和医生每天中午都要睡上一觉，戴维森无法容忍这种怠惰的习惯。门砰地开了，汤普森小姐走了进来，她四下里打量了一番房间，径直朝戴维森走过去。

“你这个下三烂，卑鄙小人！你跟总督说我什么了？”

她气急败坏，唾沫乱飞。在她停下来的片刻，传教士推过来一把椅子。

“不想坐一坐吗，汤普森小姐？我一直想再跟你谈谈。”

“你这个卑劣的杂种！”

她破口大骂起来，污言秽语，粗鄙不堪。戴维森始终用冷峻的眼神看着她。

“你爱怎么骂就怎么骂，我无所谓，汤普森小姐，”他说，“不过我必须得请你记住这里还有两位女士。”

她愤怒地抑制住了泪水，面部通红浮肿，就好像在抽泣。

“发生了什么？”麦克费尔医生问。

“有个家伙刚刚过来，他说我必须乘坐下一班船离开。”

传教士的眼神闪烁了一下，不过看上去仍面无表情。

“照目前的情况来看，你休想总督同意让你留在这儿。”

“都是你干的好事！”她扯着嗓门叫道，“你骗不了我，就是你干的。”

“我不想欺骗你，那是我力劝总督采取的唯一可行的举措，这是为了让他恪尽职守。”

“为什么你就不能放过我？我没做过什么伤害你的事。”

“你尽管放心，就算你做过，我也不会恨你。”

“你以为我愿意继续待在这个连城镇都算不上的破地方吗？我看上去那么不入流吗？”

“既然如此，我不明白你还有什么可抱怨的。”他回答。

她含糊不清地怒骂了一声，冲出了房门。房间里陷入了片刻的宁静。

“我很欣慰，总督最终还是采取了行动。”戴维森最后说，“他为人软弱，优柔寡断。他说不管怎样她只在这里停留两周；她去阿皮亚以后，就到了英国管辖区，就跟他没有任何关系了。”

传教士突然站起来，大步走到了房间的另一端。

“掌权者试图逃避责任的做法真是太可怕。按照他们的说法，似乎恶魔逃出了视野就不再是恶魔了一样。那个女人的存在就是件丑闻，即使驱赶到别的岛也于事无补，最后我只能直截了当地说出来了。”

戴维森双眉紧皱，他那结实的下巴向前伸着，看起来又凶狠又坚决。

“你这话是什么意思？”

“我们教区对华盛顿并非完全没有影响，我跟总督讲，如果有人投诉他在这里的管理方式，对他是没有好处的。”

“那她何时得走？”医生迟疑了一下，问道。

“从悉尼起航到圣弗朗西斯科的客轮预计下周二到达这里，她必须坐那艘船离开。”

那还有五天的时间。第二天，麦克费尔从医院回来——如果没有更合适的事情做，大多数上午他都在医院度过——正要上楼，混血商人叫住了他。

“不好意思，麦克费尔医生，汤普森小姐病了，你能去看看她吗？”

“当然可以。”

霍恩把他领进了汤普森的房间。她正百无聊赖地坐在椅子里，既没看书也没做针线，只是目不转睛地盯着前方。她依然穿着她的白裙子，戴着插满花的硕大帽子。麦克费尔还注意到，她脂粉之下的皮肤已变得蜡黄、暗沉，目光也变得呆滞。

“听说你病了，我很难过。”他说。

“呃，我实际上没病，这样说只是想见你一下，我必须乘坐一班前往圣弗朗西斯科的轮船离开这里了。”

她看了他一眼，他注意到她的眼神突然之间变得像是受到了惊吓一般，两只手痉挛似的一张一合。商人站在门口，听着他们说话。

“这我已经知道了。”医生说。

她微微叹了口气。

“我觉得我现在不大方便去圣弗朗西斯科。我昨天下午去找了总督，但没能见到他，只见到了秘书。他告诉我只能搭乘那班船，再没有别的船到那里了。我一定要见到总督，所以今天早上我就在他家房子外面等他，他一出来我就上前跟他说话。我承认他不愿理睬我，但我不会让他把我甩开。最后他说只要戴维森牧师同意，他就不会反对我在这里继续待到去悉尼的下一班船过来。”

她停下来焦虑地看着麦克费尔医生。

“我真不知道我能做什么。”他说。

“好吧，我想或许你不会介意帮我向他求求情。我向上帝发誓，如果他允许我留下来，我不会再干别的了，只要他满意，我就待在房间里不出门。不就是两周嘛。”

“我去跟他说说。”

“他不会同意的，”霍恩说，“他让你周二搬走，你最好还是接受吧。”

“告诉他我会在悉尼找到工作的，我的意思是，正经八百的工作。这个要求不过分吧。”

“我尽力而为。”

“请尽快告诉我结果，好吗？不管怎样，得不到消息我无法安心做任何事。”

这种差事医生可不大喜欢干。以他的性格，他会采取迂回战术来处理这件事。他把汤普森小姐跟他说的话告诉了妻子，然后让她跟戴维森夫人讲一讲。传教士的态度有些反复无常，让这个女孩在帕果帕果停留两周应该没什么问题，但对于这个策略产生的结果他没有把握。传教士直接来找他了。

“我夫人跟我说汤普森和你谈过了。”

由于如此直接地交涉，麦克费尔医生的内心生起一股羞涩男人被迫打开天窗说亮话时总会有的怨气，他感到自己的怒火正一点点升起，脸变得通红。

“我真不明白她去悉尼和去圣弗朗西斯科有什么不同，只要她保证在这里规规矩矩的就行了，现在这样强求她有些过头了。”

传教士用他一贯冷峻的眼神盯着他。

“那她为何不愿回圣弗朗西斯科呢？”

“我没问。”医生有些不耐烦地回答，“我认为一个人管好自己的事就行了。”

这或许不是一个很老练的回答。

“总督命令她乘坐离岛的第一班船离开，他只是履行了自己的职责，我不会干预的。她留在这里是个危险。”

“我觉得你太严厉了，专横过头了。”

两位女士有些惊讶地看着医生，但她们并不担心会吵起来，因为传教士已经笑得很温和了。

“我很遗憾你居然如此看待我，麦克费尔医生。相信我，我的心为那个不幸的女人感到悲痛，但我只能恪尽职守。”

医生没有回答，阴着脸朝窗外望去。这一次雨停了，已经可以看到港湾对岸的树丛里当地人村落中的小屋了。

“我想趁着雨停出去一下。”他说。

“不要因为我不能遂你心愿就怨恨我。”戴维森苦笑了一下说，“我非常尊敬你，医生，如果你觉得我这个人不好，我会很难过的。”

“我敢肯定你自以为很了不起，所以根本不会安之若素地接受我的建议。”他回击道。

“这点倒是没错。”戴维森轻声笑起来。

麦克费尔医生为自己无缘无故地蛮不讲理感到自责。当他下楼时，汤普森小姐正站在半开的门前等着他。

“好了，”她问，“你跟他说过了吗？”

“说了，很遗憾，他不愿意。”他回答说，因为觉得尴尬所以不敢去瞧她。

但当她倏地呜咽起来时，他飞快地瞄了她一眼。他看见她的脸因恐惧而变得苍白，这让他大感惊慌。忽然间他灵光一闪。

“但不要放弃希望，我觉得他们对待你的方式是可耻的，我会亲自去见总督。”

“现在吗？”

他点点头，她的脸上露出了喜色。

“呀！你真是好人。如果你帮我说话，我肯定总督会让我留下的。在这里我不会做任何不该做的事。”

麦克费尔医生不太清楚自己为何下定决心要向总督求助。汤普森小姐的事本来和他毫不相干，不过传教士激怒了他，他的脾气一直都是压抑着的。他在总督家里见到了总督本人。他是个魁梧英俊的人，做过水手，一把花白的牙刷似的胡须，穿着笔挺的白色斜纹布制服。

“我来见您是为了一个跟我们同住一起的女人，”他说，“她的名字叫汤普森。”

“我想关于她我已经听得够多了，麦克费尔医生。”总督笑眯眯地说，“我命令她下周二离开这里，我只能这样做。”

“我想请求您是否可以破一次例，让她待到从圣弗朗西斯科来的船抵达这里，这样她就可以乘船前往悉尼了。我保证她会行为良好的。”

总督保持着微笑，不过他眯起了眼睛，神情变得严肃起来。

“我很愿意帮你，麦克费尔医生，不过我既然已经下了命令，就必须得执行。”

医生尽可能合理地分析了整个情况，总督脸上的笑容已经完全消失了，他目光闪躲、闷不作声地听着。麦克费尔知道自己是在白费口舌。

“我很抱歉给任何一位女士造成不便，不过下周二她必须坐船离开，只能这样了。”

“不过这到底有什么要紧的呢？”

“对不起，医生，除了有关部门以外，我不希望被任何人要求解释我的行政行为。”

麦克费尔用犀利的目光看着他。他想起戴维森曾暗示他威胁过总督，而从总督的态度里，他读出了明显的尴尬。

“戴维森是个该死的好事者！”他怒道。

“不瞒你说，麦克费尔医生，我不能说我对戴维森先生有很高的评价，不过我必须得承认，他是出于自己的职责跟我指出，让汤普森小姐这种性情的女人留在这里是危险的，这里有很多士兵驻扎在当地人中。”

他站了起来，麦克费尔医生也不得不跟着起身。

“我得请你原谅，我还有个约会。请代我向麦克费尔夫人致意。”

医生垂头丧气地离开了。他知道汤普森小姐在等着他，他不想亲自告诉她事情没成，于是他直接从后门进了房子，然后蹑手蹑脚地上了楼梯，就像是有什么见不得人的事一样。

晚饭时他一言不发，局促不安，而传教士兴高采烈，眉飞色舞。麦克费尔医生感觉到，他的目光不时落在自己身上，带有一种胜利者的喜悦之情。他突然觉得戴维森已经知道他拜访总督一事，并且知道他没成功。不过他到底怎么得知的呢？这个人本领可真是深不可测。饭后他看到霍恩站在阳台上，就做出一副要跟他随便聊几句的样子，走了过去。

“她想知道你有没有见到总督。”房东低声道。

“见到了，不过他还是无动于衷，非常抱歉，我已经无能为力了。”

“我就知道他不会答应的。他们不敢和传教士对着干。”

“你们在谈什么呢？”戴维森友好地问道，过来加入了他们的谈话。

“我在说至少还得再过一星期你们才能去阿皮亚。”商人说。

霍恩离开后，两个人回到客厅，戴维森先生每顿饭后都会有一个小时的消遣时间。不久之后他们便听到了一阵怯怯的敲门声。

“进来！”戴维森夫人用她那尖锐的嗓音说道。

门没有被打开。她起身开了门，他们看到汤普森小姐站在门槛处。她的样子看起来变化极大，不再是那个在路上讥讽她们的招摇轻佻的女人，而变成了一个面容忧伤、担惊受怕的女人。她的头发一贯都会精心梳理一番，现在却乱糟糟地堆在脖颈上。她穿的室内拖鞋、短裙和衬衣全都破破烂烂、肮脏不堪。她站在门口，脸上泪迹斑斑，不敢进来。

“你想干什么？”戴维森夫人厉声问道。

“我可以跟戴维森先生谈谈吗？”她哽咽着说。

传教士站起来向她走去。

“进来吧，汤普森小姐。”他语气热忱地说，“有什么我能为你效劳的？”

她走进了房间。

“唉，我为前几天跟你说的话——为我所做的一切——感到抱歉，我想我当时有点儿喝多了，请原谅。”

“呃，这不算什么。我想我的心胸足够宽广，还是可以受得了几句难听的话的。”

她走到他跟前，完全是一副卑躬屈膝的样子。

“你把我打败了，我已经精疲力竭了。你不会让我去圣弗朗西斯科的吧？”

他的和蔼一下子消失了，声音突然变得尖锐而严厉。

“你为何不愿回到那里？”

她在他面前蜷缩着。

“我的亲友们都住在那儿，我不希望他们看到我这个样子，别的地方你让我去哪儿都行。”

“你为何不想回圣弗朗西斯科？”

“我已经告诉你了。”

他俯下身子，盯着她，两只炯炯有神的大眼睛似乎要将她的灵魂看穿。然后，他突然倒吸了一口气。

“监狱！”

她尖叫一声，跪在他脚下，紧紧抱住了他的腿。

“不要把我送回那里，我向上帝发誓我会做一个好女人，我会把一切都放弃掉。”

她开始喋喋不休地胡乱恳求起来，泪水哗哗地从涂着脂粉的脸颊上滚落。他弯下腰托起她的脸，逼着她看向自己。

“是不是因为那个地方，那个叫监狱的地方？”

“他们抓住我之前我就溜了。”她喘着气说，“如果警察逮住我，我将被判上三年。”

他松开了手，她一下子瘫在了地上，痛苦地呜咽着。麦克费尔医生站了起来。

“现在一切都不一样了，”他说，“既然你知道了这个情况，就更不能让她回去了。再给她一次机会，她想翻开新的一页。”

“我正是要给她一个前所未有的好机会。如果她感到悔恨，就让她接受惩罚吧。”

她误解了他的话，抬起头，呆滞的眼睛里闪现出一丝希望。

“你放过我了？”

“没有，周二你得坐船去圣弗朗西斯科。”

她发出了一声惊恐的呻吟，而后便是低弱嘶哑的尖叫声，听上去根本不像人发出的声音。她发疯般地把头撞向地面，麦克费尔医生跳起身，将她扶了起来。

“别这样，你没必要这么做。你最好还是回房间躺一会儿，我去给你拿点儿药。”

他帮助她站了起来，半拖半抱地将她送下了楼。他对戴维森夫人和自己的妻子没有设法帮忙的行为感到怒不可遏。混血商人正站在楼梯平台上，在他的帮助下，医生把汤普森小姐扶到床上躺着。她一直在呻吟，不断地哭喊，几乎神志不清了，他便给她打了一针。当再次上楼时，他觉得全身发热、筋疲力尽。

“我让她躺下了。”

两个女人和戴维森还坐在他离开时的位置上，打他走后，他们没有进行任何的活动和交流。

“我在等你，”戴维森用一种陌生、冷淡的声音说道，“我想让你们跟我一起为这个犯下错误的姐妹的灵魂祈祷。”

他从书架上取下《圣经》，然后在他们刚才吃晚饭的餐桌旁落座。桌子还未收拾，他把茶壶推到一边，开始用洪亮、深沉、有力的嗓音给他们诵读耶稣基督审判犯了通奸罪的女子的那一章。

“现在，跟我一起跪下来，让我们为我们亲爱的姐妹——莎蒂·汤普森的灵魂祈祷。”

他开始了滔滔不绝、激情洋溢的祷告，恳求上帝施恩于这个罪孽深重的女人。麦克费尔夫人和戴维森夫人也闭着眼睛跪了下来。医生即便甚感惊讶、尴尬和局促不安，但还是跪了下来。传教士的祈祷狂放而流畅，他自己都极受感动，讲着讲着便泪湿两颊。屋外，无情的雨水不住地下着，不止不歇，带着一种人类常有的强烈的恶意。

最后他停了下来，沉默片刻后说道：

“现在我们再重复一遍主祷文。”

重复完之后，他们都跟着他站了起来。戴维森夫人面容苍白而安宁，她感到舒适、平和，而麦克费尔夫妇却突然窘迫了，不知所措。

“我下去看看她怎么样了。”麦克费尔医生说。

当他敲了门之后，是霍恩给他开的门，汤普森小姐正坐在一把摇椅里，轻轻地抽泣着。

“你在那里做什么？”麦克费尔大声喊道，“我跟你说了要躺着。”

“我躺不下去，我想见戴维森先生。”

“可怜的孩子，你认为这有用吗？你根本无法动摇他。”

“他说过如果我请他来他就会来。”

麦克费尔给商人打了个手势。

“去把他叫来。”

商人上楼时他和汤普森一起默默地等待着。戴维森进来了。

“非常抱歉请你到这里来。”她面色忧郁地看着他说。

“我一直等着你来请我，我知道上帝会回应我的祈祷的。”

他们相互凝视了片刻，然后她就把目光移开了，说话时也一直没敢正眼瞧他。

“我一直是个坏女人，我想忏悔。”

“感谢上帝，感谢上帝，他听到我们的祷告了。”

他转向两位男士。

“让我单独跟她待会儿，告诉戴维森夫人我们的祈祷上帝已经答复了。”

他们走了出去，随手关上了门。

“哎呀！”商人叹息道。

那天晚上麦克费尔医生迟迟不能入睡，当他听到传教士走上楼来，他看了看表，已经夜里两点了，但传教士仍没有立即上床，因为他一直透过房间之间的木制隔板听着他大声祈祷，直至精疲力竭，酣然睡去。

第二天早上他再见到传教士时，他的样子让他很是惊异。他的脸色比平时显得更加苍白疲倦，不过眼睛里却闪烁着奇异的光芒，看上去似乎欣喜若狂。

“我想让你等会儿下去看看莎蒂，”他说，“我不敢说她的身体好些了，但她的精神——她的精神已经有所改观。”

医生感到恍惚不安。

“昨天你跟她待到很晚啊。”他说。

“是的，她受不了我离开她。”

“你看起来很高兴啊！”医生怒不可遏道。

戴维森的眼睛里洋溢着狂喜的光辉。

“我得到了莫大恩宠，昨天晚上，我有幸让一个迷失的灵魂回到了耶稣的怀抱。”

汤普森小姐依旧斜靠在摇椅上，床没有整理，房间乱成一团。她懒得梳妆打扮，只穿了一件脏兮兮的睡衣，头发胡乱地打了个结。虽然已经用湿毛巾草草擦过了，但她的脸整个儿都哭肿了，皱纹密布。人看起来死气沉沉。

医生进门时她有气无力地抬眼看了看，惊惧而伤心。

“戴维森先生在哪里？”她问。

“如果你想找他，他很快就到。”医生不悦道，“我来看看你怎么样了。”

“哦，我想我没事了，你不用担心了。”

“吃过东西了吗？”

“霍恩给我拿了些咖啡。”

她焦急地望着门口。

“你认为他会很快下来吗？我觉得有他在身边，好像感觉就没那么糟糕了。”

“你周二还走吗？”

“是的，他说我必须走。请让他马上过来，你帮不上忙，现在只有他能帮我。”

“那好吧。”医生说。

接下来的三天，传教士几乎把所有的时间都花在了莎蒂·汤普森那儿，只是吃饭时才跟他们在一起。麦克费尔医生注意到他几乎没怎么吃。

“他把自己弄得太疲惫了，”戴维森夫人心疼道，“如果他不注意的话，身体会垮掉的，但他就是不肯宽待自己。”

她的面色一片苍白，她跟麦克费尔说她昨晚一夜未眠。从汤普森小姐那里上楼后，戴维森一直在祈祷，直到筋疲力尽为止。但尽管如此他也没睡多久，一两个小时后他就起床穿上了衣服，然后沿着港湾散步去了。他做了些奇怪的梦。

“今天早上他跟我说，他梦到了内布拉斯加州的山丘。”戴维森夫人说。

“那是很奇怪。”麦克费尔医生应道。

他记得他曾在火车横穿美国时透过车窗见过那些山丘，它们就像巨大的鼹鼠窝，光滑圆润，兀立在平原之上。麦克费尔医生还记得让他为之一动的是它们活像女人的双峰。

戴维森的坐立不安甚至到了连他自己也忍无可忍的地步，但有一种妙不可言的兴奋让他重新振作了起来。他要将那个不幸的女人心底的隐蔽角落里残存的最后一丝罪恶连根拔起，他跟她一起读《圣经》，一起祈祷。

“太棒了！”有天晚餐时他跟他们讲，“真正的重生！她的灵魂曾如夜晚一般漆黑，但现在却变得跟新雪一样纯净洁白，相形之下我是如此卑微、如此怯懦。她对于自己所有的罪恶所做的忏悔是如此美丽，我简直连她外套的下摆都不配碰一下。”

“你还是决心把她送回圣弗朗西斯科吗？”医生问，“在美国监狱里待上三年，我本以为就这一点你应该会放过她。”

“啊，你还不明白吗？这是必需的。你以为我的心没有在为她流血吗？我爱她就像爱我的妻子和姐妹。她在监狱里的每一天，我都将与她一同承受她所遭遇的痛苦。”

“一派胡言！”医生不耐烦地叫嚷道。

“你不明白是因为你是盲目的。她犯了罪，就必须为此受苦。我知道她将遭受什么，她将忍饥挨饿，受尽折磨和羞辱。我希望她接受这种人类的惩罚，就当作向上帝进献。我希望她能愉快地接受这些，她拥有了一个我们少有的机会。上帝是非常怜悯、非常仁慈的。”

戴维森的声音兴奋得颤抖了起来，他几乎是口齿不清地将这番话从嘴唇间抖搂出来的。

“每天我都跟她一起祈祷，离开她后我依旧在祷告。我全身心地投入其中，这样上帝或许就能赐她以巨大的恩惠。我希望把渴望受罚的强烈愿望植入到她的心中，以至于最终，即便我放她离开，她都会拒绝。我想让她感受到，牢狱中的痛苦惩戒是她放在上帝脚下的感恩供品——是上帝把自己的生命献给了她。”

日子慢悠悠地过去了。整个房子的人皆因关注着楼下这个可怜的、备受折磨的女人，而生活在一种不自然的兴奋当中。她如同一个为血腥的邪神崇拜仪式准备的牺牲品。恐惧让她麻木，她已无法忍受戴维森离开她的视线。只有他在身边，她才有勇气，她对他的依赖已到了盲从的地步。她常常哭泣，并诵读《圣经》，进行祈祷。有时她会感到疲惫和厌倦，但她确实期待审判快快到来，因为那似乎是让她从正在遭受着的痛苦中解脱出来的一种直截了当的、实实在在的方法。她已经受够了现在主宰她身心的这种不清不楚的恐惧了。罪恶已经让她抛掉了所有的个人虚荣，她在房间里四下晃荡，头发蓬乱，衣冠不整，身上穿着那件俗艳的晨衣。她已经四天没脱睡衣了，长筒袜也没穿。屋子里杂乱无章，而室外雨水仍残忍地落个不停。你感到九天之上的水必定已经倾空，但大雨依然如注，直刷刷地重击在铁皮屋顶上，一遍又一遍，疯狂地周而复始。所有的一切都是湿漉漉、黏糊糊的，墙上和门口的皮靴都发霉了。一个个不眠夜里，蚊子愤怒地嗡嗡作响。

“雨哪怕停上一天也不至于这么糟糕。”麦克费尔医生说。

他们都在盼着星期二的到来，到时从悉尼来的前往圣弗朗西斯科的船就到了。压力令人窒息。就麦克费尔医生而言，也想早点儿摆脱那个不幸的女人，到时他的同情和怨气都随之烟消云散。既然不可避免那就接受好了，他感觉当船起航以后他的呼吸都会变得更加自由。莎蒂·汤普森将由总督办公室的一名职员护送上船，这个人星期一晚上来拜访了汤普森小姐，告诉她第二天上午十一点做好准备，当时戴维森正陪着她。

“我来看看一切是否准备妥当，我打算亲自陪着她上船。”

汤普森小姐没有开口。

当麦克费尔医生吹灭蜡烛小心地爬进蚊帐时，他松了口气。

“好了，感谢上帝，一切都结束了，明天这个时候她就离开了。”

“戴维森夫人也会开心的，她说‘他已经瘦得不成样子了’。”麦克费尔夫人说，“她也变成另外一个人。”

“谁？”

“莎蒂。我本来从未觉得这件事是可能的，但它的确使人变得谦逊。”

麦克费尔医生没有答话，他很快就睡着了。他疲乏不堪，睡得比平时都香。

第二天早上，他被一只放在他胳膊上的手弄醒了，便一下子坐了起来，随后看到霍恩正站在床边。霍恩把手指放在嘴边示意他不要大声说话，并做手势让医生跟他走。他平常穿破旧的帆布工作服，但今天赤着脚，仅系着当地人常穿的拉瓦拉瓦，突然有了一副野蛮人的样子。麦克费尔医生下床时看见他身上刺着密密的文身。霍恩又给他打了个手势，示意他到阳台上去。麦克费尔医生下了床跟着他走了出去。

“不要弄出声音，”他小声说道，“有人找你，穿上外套和鞋，快！”

麦克费尔医生的第一个念头是汤普森小姐发生了什么事情。

“怎么啦？需要带治疗仪器吗？”

“快，请快些！”

麦克费尔医生悄悄回到卧室，拿了一件雨衣披在睡衣上，又穿上一双橡胶底的鞋，然后他回到了商人那里，两人蹑手蹑脚地下了楼。通往大路的门开着，路上站着五六个当地人。

“怎么啦？”医生重复道。

“跟我来。”霍恩说。

他走出门，医生在后边跟着，当地人陆续跟在他们后面。他们穿过大路，来到海岸边。医生看到一群当地人正站在水边围着什么东西。他们快步走过去，约有几十码的距离。看到医生过来，当地人让开了一个小口，商人把他往前推了推。这时他看到，一个可怕的东西正一半泡在水里，一半露在岸上，是戴维森的尸体。麦克费尔医生弯下腰——他不是一遇到紧急情况便惊慌失措的人——把尸体翻了过来。喉咙从两耳之间整个切开了，右手还拿着作案工具——剃须刀。

“身体已经凉透了，”医生说，“他肯定已经死了有些时候了。”

“刚才一个年轻人在上班的路上看到他躺在那儿，就过来告诉了我。你认为他是自杀吗？”

“是的，得让人去报警。”

霍恩用当地话说了句什么，两个年轻人就离开了。

“在他们到来之前不要动他。”医生说。

“他们不能把他带到我的房子去，我不会让他进我的房子的。”

“你要按当局说的做，”医生厉声说道，“实际上，我想他们会把他运到停尸间。”

他们在原地等着。商人从他的拉瓦拉瓦折缝里掏出一盒香烟，然后递给了麦克费尔医生一支。他们一边抽着，一边凝视着尸体。麦克费尔医生想不明白。

“你觉得他为什么这样做？”霍恩问。

医生耸了耸肩。过了一会儿，一名海军军官带着当地警察拿着担架来了，很快又来了几名海军军官和一名海军医生。他们有条不紊地处理好了一切。

“他妻子怎么样了？”一名军官问。

“既然你们来了，我回房子再穿点儿衣服。我想，这件事会让她心碎的，在给他稍加修饰之前最好不要让她看到。”

“我想那样做是对的。”海军医生说。

当麦克费尔回去时，他看到他的妻子已经快穿戴好了。

“戴维森夫人很担心她丈夫的情况。”他一回来她就跟他讲，“他一整夜都没睡觉，她听到他在夜里两点离开了汤普森小姐的房间，然后出去了。如果从那一刻起他就一直在四处走动，那肯定会死掉的。”

麦克费尔医生告诉了她发生的情况，并让她委婉地把这个坏消息告诉戴维森夫人。

“不过他为何这样做呢？”她战栗着问。

“我不知道。”

“但我不能告诉她，我不能。”

“你必须去。”

她恐惧地看了他一眼，然后走了出去，他听到她进了戴维森夫人的房间。麦克费尔等了一会儿才重新振作起来，开始刮须、洗脸，然后穿好衣服，坐在床上等他妻子。她终于回来了。

“她想见他。”她说。

“他们把他送去停尸间了，我们最好陪她一起下去。她情况怎么样？”

“我想她是吓坏了，她没有哭，但全身颤抖得跟一片树叶一样。”

“我们最好马上过去。”

他们敲门后，戴维森夫人走了出来，她没有流泪，脸色苍白得厉害。在医生看来，这种镇静不大合乎情理。他们一言不发，沉默地向大路走去。到了停尸间，戴维森夫人说道：

“让我一个人进去看看他。”

他们都站在一边。一个当地人给她开了门，她进去后又关上了。他们坐下来等着。一两个白人走过来，小声地跟他们说了些话。麦克费尔医生再一次把他所知道的情况跟他们讲了一遍。最后门轻轻地打开了，戴维森夫人走了出来，众人陷入了沉默。

“我现在准备回去了。”她说。

她的声音冷酷而坚定，眼里的神色让麦克费尔医生感到困惑，她苍白的面容冷峻异常。他们慢慢地往回走，一句话都没说，最后他们走到了房子对面的拐弯处。戴维森夫人喘了口气，那一刻他们都停了下来。一个叫人难以置信的声音猛地传入他们耳中。那台沉默已久的留声机又开始播放了，放的是拉格泰姆音乐，声音又大又刺耳。

“那是什么声音？”麦克费尔夫人惊恐地叫起来。

“我们还是走吧。”戴维森夫人说。

他们走上台阶，进了大厅。汤普森小姐正站在她房间的门口跟一个水手聊天。她身上陡然出现了变化，不再是过去几天里那个畏缩的慵懒模样，她一身盛装，穿着白裙子和亮闪闪的白靴，套着长棉袜的一双胖乎乎的小腿从靴筒顶部挤出来；她的头发精心梳理过了，戴着那顶插着俗艳花朵的硕大帽子；脸上涂了脂粉，眉毛黑得扎眼，嘴唇是猩红的。她身子挺得笔直，俨然还是他们初识时的那个招摇女人。他们进来后，她突然爆发出一阵嘲弄的大笑。接着，当戴维森夫人不自觉地停下来时，她攒了一口唾沫吐了出来。戴维森夫人向后退了一下，两颊顿时变得通红，而后用手捂住脸赶紧离开了，她快步跑上了楼。麦克费尔医生怒不可遏，把这个女人推回了她自己的房间。

“你到底在搞什么鬼？”他叫嚷道，“把那个该死的机器关掉！”

他冲过去，把唱片扯了下来。她冲他怒道：

“啊，医生，你住手！你到我房间里来到底想干什么？”

“你什么意思？”他喊道，“你究竟什么意思？”

她镇定了下来，但她表情中的嘲讽和话语中的轻蔑与仇恨，没人能够描述。

“你们男人！都是污秽、肮脏的猪！你们都一样，全都一样！猪！猪！”

麦克费尔医生倒吸了一口气，他明白了。

贞　　洁


张晓峰　译





几乎没有任何东西能与一支高档雪茄的滋味相媲美。我年轻的时候很穷，只有偶尔别人送我一支我才能过过烟瘾。我当时下定决心要是有了钱，我一定要在每天午饭和晚饭后都美美地吸上一支雪茄。说起来，这还是我年轻时所做的决定中唯一坚持下来的一个，也是唯一一个我实现了并从未因幻灭而怨恨的抱负。我喜欢那种香味浓郁但又不太冲的雪茄，长度不能太短，太短的话，在你品出滋味前，烟就吸没了；也不能太长，太长的话又会让你感到厌烦。雪茄烟卷的松紧也要正好。过紧的话吸起来费力，过松的话，吸到最后，嘴边就会变得肮脏不堪。只有这样一支雪茄，吸完之后，你才会有一种意犹未尽的感觉。但是当你吸完最后一口，扔掉残剩的烟蒂，望着眼前渐渐消逝于周围空气中的最后一缕烟雾时，如果你是一个感性之人，一想到这支雪茄所经历的那些劳动、养护，还有苦心，以及为了提供给你这半小时的欢愉所必需的复杂工序随着雪茄的燃尽都化为乌有，你不难产生一种伤感之情。对常年在热带阳光的灼烤下汗流浃背，乘船走遍了七大洋的这类人而言，吃着一打牡蛎（就着半瓶干白葡萄酒），这种伤感就更加强烈了。如果将牡蛎换成羊排，这种感伤之情就会强烈得让人难以承受。因为羊是一种动物。你不禁要想了，自打地球表面有了生物，又经过了亿万年的变迁，动物们经过无数代繁衍的结果就是它们最终被码放到盛满碎冰的盘子上，或置于银质烤肉架上。也许嘴里嚼着一只牡蛎难以让你产生这种极端严肃的联想。我们通过生物进化的知识知道，这种双壳类生物千百万年来几乎没有变化，因而难以获得人类的同情。这种生物以一种超然的态度生活在地球上，简直就是对我们人类进取精神的一种冒犯；这种生物志得意满地躺在那里，让我们自负的人类顿生厌恶之情。但如果眼前是一盘羊排，恐怕所有人都会被激发出无限的遐思：毕竟在羊这种动物的进化历史中，处处可见我们人类的影子，我们在餐桌上温柔的一小口与这种动物密不可分。

有时想想，即使我们人类的命运也同样令人难以捉摸。看看身边那些不起眼的普通人，不论他们是银行职员、清洁工还是站在合唱团第二排人到中年的老姑娘，都会让人产生一种好奇之感。我们不禁想到，人类是怎样从原生浆液开始，经过冗长的历史变迁与生命的演化，经过一长串灾变事件，成了现在他们各自的样子？当这样巨大的兴衰变迁造就了此时的他们，你不禁要想，这些人的身上一定寄托着某种巨大的意义，你也一定会想，无论这些人的生活中遇到了什么难事，与生命精神或其他造就了他们生命的事物相比，都是小事一桩。思路突然中断了。正想着世界的起源，突然又想起了别的事情，似乎这两者之间没有任何联系。这简直就是个白痴在讲故事！如果不是这件事情有些稀奇古怪，情节又颇具戏剧性，谁还能在这里听我啰里啰唆讲这些琐碎之事呢？

一件本来也许不会发生的小事却产生了重大的后果，这真是谁也无法料到。看起来所有的事情都全靠运气。我们一个最细微的活动也许就能对他人的一生产生重大的影响，而这些人却和我们毫不相干。如果不是某天我走到了街对面，我在这里要讲的故事根本就不会发生。生活有时真的很不可思议，只有具备特别的幽默感的人才能品味出其中的乐趣。

一个春日的上午，我正在邦德大街上无所事事地闲逛。到中午的时候，我突然想起应该到索斯比拍卖行去看看，看是否有自己感兴趣的东西在拍卖。现在街上正堵车，我穿过拥堵的车辆，走到街道另一侧时，碰到了一个我在婆罗洲时认识的男人。他刚刚从一家衣帽店走出来。

“你好啊，莫顿，”我向他打招呼道，“什么时候回的国啊？”

“我回国大约有一星期了吧。”

他是一个地方官员。英属北婆罗洲总督给我写了一封介绍信去见他。我在信中告诉他，我打算在他那里待上一个星期，应该是住在政府开办的招待所。当我乘船到达那里的时候，他到船上接我，让我同他住。我不同意他的安排，我无法同一个完全陌生的人在一起待一个星期，我也不想让他为我破费。此外，我想自己一个人住招待所会更自由一些。但他不听我的解释。

“我家有很多空房间，”他说道，“而且招待所的条件很糟糕。我已经整整六个月没有跟一个白种人说话了，我周围那帮人让我烦透了。”

当我跟莫顿乘坐汽艇上岸，回到他住的平房后，他请我喝了一杯。面对我这个客人，他有些手足无措。他突然感到有些窘迫，说话的语气也不自然了。我尽力让他感觉像在家一样（但这是他自己的家，原本不该由我来这样做）。我问他有没有新唱片，他打开留声机，拉格泰姆的曲调响了起来，他这才恢复了自信。

他的平房可以俯瞰蜿蜒而过的河流，他的客厅设在一个大阳台上。客厅内的家具陈设非常呆板，与房主经常变换工作地点的政府官员的身份相衬。墙上挂着一些装饰品，包括当地人戴的各种帽子，还有各种动物的角、吹管和长矛；书架上则搁着侦探小说和旧杂志。客厅内还有一架立式小钢琴，琴键已经有些发黄了。客厅内虽说非常凌乱，但待着还算舒服。

不幸的是，我记不太清他当时是什么模样了。他很年轻，我后来了解到他当时只有二十八岁。他笑起来像个大男孩，很是迷人。我同他在一起待了一个星期，感觉很愉快。我俩沿着河来回溜达，一起去爬山。一天，我俩还同几个种植园主一起吃了午饭，这些种植园主居住在离这里二十英里远的地方。每天晚上我们都去俱乐部玩。这家俱乐部仅有的会员是当地一家鞣酸加工厂的经理和他的助手。但他们之间关系密切，很少与外人往来。只是在莫顿提出抗议，说他带了客人来，他们不能让他没面子的情况下，他们才同意与我俩打一局桥牌，但气氛并不友好。我俩从俱乐部回到住处吃晚饭，听听音乐，之后就上床睡觉了。莫顿很少待在办公室办公。你会以为他的生活一定很沉闷，但他却一天到晚精力充沛、情绪高昂。他是第一次出任这类职务，很高兴自己能够独立完成一项工作。他唯一感到焦虑的是在他督建的这条公路完工前，自己就会被调到其他地方去。他是发自内心地喜爱这项工作。是他提议修建这条公路，然后哄着当局拿出钱来让他督建这条公路的。他亲自勘察、测绘，独自解决了施工中出现的技术难题。每天早上去办公室之前，他都要开着那辆快要散架的旧福特车到施工现场转转，查看前一天的施工进度。他心无旁骛，甚至连晚上做梦都梦到这条路。他预计这条公路能在一年内完工，在完工之前他不想被调离。即便是画家或雕刻家创作一件艺术作品时也没有他现在这么高的热情。我想，正是他的这股热情让我喜欢上了他。我喜欢他对工作的热情，喜欢他的诚恳朴实。他为了完成这项工作已经达到了忘我的地步，孤独的生活，是否能得到提拔，甚至连回国的事，对他而言都无关紧要了。我忘了这段公路有多长，大概有十五到二十英里吧；我也忘了修这条公路的目的是什么，我想莫顿也不大关心修这条公路的目的。他对这项工作的热情就像艺术家的热情一样，他是抱着征服大自然的目的去完成这项工作的，而在这个过程中他学到了知识。他要与热带雨林抗争，倾盆暴雨会将几个星期的施工顷刻冲毁，道路测量时也会出现种种问题。他要负责招募和组织施工队，而且还要面对资金短缺的难题。他靠想象力支撑着自己。他的工作就如同一部宏大的史诗，工作中的酸甜苦辣如同一部有着无数情节的英雄传奇故事。

他唯一抱怨的事情是白日太短。白天他有公务。他是法官，也是收税员；在他满二十八岁后还成了所属教区的教父和教母，他要不时离开家到各处去走访。除非他盯在施工现场，否则工程根本不会有进展。他恨不得一天二十四个小时都待在工地上督促那些一心磨洋工的劳工更加卖力地工作。碰巧我到那里的前不久就发生了一件使他非常高兴的事。他曾提出将这条道路的一段分包给一个中国人，但这个包工头要价太高，超过了莫顿的预算。经过漫长的讨价还价之后，他们还是无法达成协议。眼看着道路施工的进度无法完成，莫顿心中火冒三丈，但却无计可施。然而一天早上来到办公室后，他听说昨天晚上在一家中国人开办的赌场中发生了一起斗殴事件。一名中国苦力在斗殴中受了重伤，肇事者已经被逮捕，而这名肇事者正是那个包工头。包工头被起诉了，证据确凿，莫顿判了他服劳役八个月。

“现在他还得去修这条该死的路，而且一分钱也拿不到了。”莫顿告诉我这个故事的时候，两眼闪闪发光。

一天上午，我们看见了这个正在干活的家伙。他身着犯人们穿的纱笼，冷漠地干着活儿。他泰然地接受了自己这种倒霉的命运。

“我告诉过他，如果道路能早日完成，我就免除他剩余的刑期，”莫顿说道，“他非常高傲，竟然拒绝了。其实这对我来说不是小事一桩吗，是不是？”

当我与莫顿告别时，我让他回国后一定要和我联系。他向我保证一回国就立马给我写信。一个人可能会在一时冲动之下发出这类邀请，而另一人可能完全是非常真诚地对待这件事。但是当后者真把这件事当真了，则前者多少会感到有些惊愕。人们经常在回国后与他们在海外时完全判若两人。在海外时他们表现得平易近人、热忱不做作。他们会有很多有趣的事告诉你，他们会对你非常友好。你会非常急于做点儿什么，以此来表示自己对所受的热情款待的感激之情。但真要回报起来却很难。有些人很善于当东家，他们会让客人有种宾至如归的感觉。但他们却可能是些让人乏味的客人。他们会紧张，很腼腆。当你把他们介绍给自己的朋友时，你的朋友们会认为他们乏味至极。你的朋友们会尽量表现得礼貌一些。但这些陌生人一走，朋友们就会宽慰地舒一口气，谈话也会再次恢复到往常那种轻松的氛围。我想，那些早早就参加了工作，生活在边远地区的人对此会感受更深一些，因为他们从中得到的是苦涩和羞辱感。因为我发现，那些居住在深林边缘，在远离总部的分支机构工作的人很少接受别人的邀请。尽管这些邀请非常诚挚，他们自己当初也是非常真心地接受了邀请，但他们还是不会践约。但莫顿不同，他是一个年轻的单身汉。通常这些人的妻子更难参与社交活动。其他女人只要扫一眼她们身上穿的土气服装，看看她们的神态，就能知道她们是外省人，然后用冷漠的态度将她们晾在一边。但一个男人还可以玩玩桥牌、打打网球、跳跳舞。莫顿的气质很迷人，只要有一两天时间，他就能适应这种环境，对此我毫不怀疑。

“你回国了怎么不告诉我呢？”我问他道。

“我想，你可能并不想被我打扰。”他笑着说。

“真是胡说八道。”

我们就这样站在邦德大街的路边说了一会儿话，当然在我看来他变化很大。我在他那里的时候，他从来都只穿卡其色的短裤和一件网球衫，只有在晚上我俩从俱乐部回到住处后，他才会换上一件睡衣上装，和一条纱笼来吃晚饭。这身装束可以说是迄今为止人类所发明的服装中，穿着最舒适的晚间服装了。现在他身穿一身蓝哔叽西装，显得有些拘束。在雪白衬衣领子的衬托下，他的面孔更显黝黑了。

“那条路修得怎么样了？”我问道。

“修完了。我一直担心工程不能按时完工，耽误我回国的行程。快完工的时候遇到了一两个障碍，但我督促他们往前抢进度。我在回国的前一天开着那辆福特车在这条路上从头跑到尾，一路都没有停车。”

我大笑起来。他高兴的样子很迷人。

“你回伦敦后都在忙些什么？”

“买衣服。”

“玩得开心吗？”

“很开心。就是有点儿孤单，这你知道。但我并不在意。我每晚都去看一场演出。帕尔默一家就要回伦敦了。我想你在沙捞越[1]时见过他们。我们打算一起玩玩。但他俩要先回苏格兰，因为帕尔默夫人的母亲病了。”

他的话虽然是轻描淡写，但却刺到了我的痛处。他们这类人都有这样共同的经历。这种经历让人想想就心碎。离回国还有好几个月的时间，他们就开始制订回国的计划；当他们离船踏上伦敦的土地时，他们会兴奋得难以自制。伦敦！这里到处都是商店、俱乐部、剧院和餐厅。伦敦！他们将在这里生活下去了。伦敦！他们将淹没于其中。伦敦对他们而言是一个陌生而混乱的城市，没有敌意，但充满了冷漠，而他们迷失在了这里。他们在这里没有朋友，他们与在这里结交的熟人没有任何共同之处。他们在这里比在丛林中更感孤独。如果在剧院碰上了一个他们在东方认识的熟人，他们会感到十分欣慰（或许对方却对此深感厌烦，极为反感）。他们也许会约好在某个晚上见面，在欢声笑语中回味他们在一起时的快乐时光，谈论共同的朋友，最后还会相互透露一点儿自己当年的小秘密。当然过后也不会为此而后悔。当他们要分手的时候，他们还会约定下次见面的时间。他们会相互拜访对方的家庭，当然也很高兴见到彼此的家人。但今非昔比，环境已经不同了，他们会感到自己有点儿像是个局外人。你最终意识到伦敦人的生活就是这样死气沉沉。回国的确令人兴趣盎然，但现在你真的无法再忍受这里的生活了。有时你会想念自己俯瞰河流的平房，想念自己当初在那里旅游的生活。那些在蓝色的月光下造访山打根[2]、古晋[3]或新加坡的日子是多么快乐呀。

我想起当初莫顿对我倾吐的期望。当时他说，一旦公路完工，了却了心事，他就要请假回国。而现在他回到了伦敦，但他却是一个人凄凉地坐在一家没有任何熟人的俱乐部里吃晚饭，或者孤单单地在苏活区的一家餐厅，吃完饭就去看电影。看电影也是自己一个人，甚至没有人在放映间隙里陪他喝上一杯。想到这里，我的心中泛起一阵剧痛。与此同时，我也想到，即使我知道他回到了伦敦，我也帮不上什么忙。上个星期我忙得不可开交。就在我要出国的头天晚上，我还陪朋友吃了饭，看了一场电影。

“今晚你怎么安排的？”我问他道。

“我打算上布莱顿酒店去吃饭。那里经常是人满为患，难得订到一个座位。但路对过有一个很有本事的家伙，他给我预订了一个座位。当然那是别人推掉的。你知道，即使难于弄到两个退座，弄到一张退座还是不难。”

“你为什么不过来和我一起吃晚饭呢？今晚我要跟几个朋友一起在干草市场饭店吃饭。饭后我们要去席罗兹俱乐部玩。”

“那好啊。”

我们约定十一点见面。然后我与他分手去赴一个约会。





我有些担心今晚我让莫顿见的那些朋友不太能让他尽兴，因为他们全都是清一色的中年人。但我实在想不出在一年中的这个季节还有哪个年轻人能被我抓来应应急，也想不出有哪个我熟识的姑娘乐于答应我，去陪一个腼腆的从马来亚来的年轻人吃饭和跳舞。不过我相信毕肖普夫妇能够尽他们所能来帮他。不管怎么说，能有几个人在一家俱乐部里陪他吃晚饭，还能在那里看美女们跳舞，应该能讨他开心，这比他自己一个人在半夜十一点就回家上床睡觉强多了。因为他在这里也没有其他地方可去了。当我还是一个医学院的学生时，我就认识了查理·毕肖普。他那时长得又瘦又小，一头浅褐色头发，相貌平平。他虽然有一双又黑又亮的漂亮眼睛，却戴了一副眼镜。他红红的圆脸盘总是一副快乐模样。他非常喜爱美女。我想他应该自有办法和莫顿相处，因为即便没钱没长相，他却总能设法召集一帮年轻人，随他一起到各地去旅游。他人很聪明，但颇为自负，而且好争论，性子急，说话很刻薄。回过头来想想，我敢说当时的他是一个不那么好处的年轻人，但我并不觉得他很讨厌。现在他已经五十五岁了，身材见胖，光头一个，但金边眼镜下的一双眼睛依然机敏有神。说话还是那么武断，甚至有些自以为是；依旧好争论，一嘴的刻薄；但他脾气很好，而且言语幽默。当这样一个人成了你的老朋友后，他的这些习性就不会再惹恼你了。你会容忍他的这些毛病，就如同容忍自己的身体缺陷一样。他是一个病理学家。他时不时会送我一本他刚刚出版的、薄薄的书。书的内容非常专业，配有大量的细菌照片做插图。这些书我都没有读过。从我时不时听来的消息来看，查理的学术观点是错误的。我想他不怎么受他同行们的待见。他毫不掩饰自己对同行们的看法，认为他们都是一些不称职的傻瓜。但他一直做着病理学家这份工作，这让他一年有六百至八百英镑的收入。我想，他并不在乎别人对他的看法。

我喜欢查理·毕肖普这个人，因为我已经与他相识三十年了；我也喜欢他妻子马热丽，因为她人非常好。当他告诉我他打算结婚的时候，我感到非常惊讶。当时他四十出头，且用情不专。因此我当时断定，他恐怕要打一辈子光棍了。他非常喜欢女人，但绝不感情用事，他也并不特别在意要哪一类型的女人。他对女性的评价在理想主义盛行的当今会被认为是粗俗的。他知道自己需要什么，也会去争取。无论是出于爱还是出于金钱，如果无法得到他想要的，他就会耸耸肩膀，一走了之。简言之，他并不需要女人来满足自己精神上的理想，只要提供给他肉体上的欢愉即可。奇怪的是，尽管他又瘦又小，相貌平平，却能找到如此多心甘情愿让他遂意的女人。至于精神上的需求，他能够从单细胞生物中得到满足。他是一个说话切中要害的人。当他告诉我要与一个叫马热丽·霍布森的年轻女人结婚时，我当即问他为什么。他咧嘴一笑。

“有三方面原因，”他说，“首先，我不跟她结婚，她就不跟我上床；其次，她能让我笑得像土狗一样；第三，她在这个世界无依无靠，没有一个亲人，必须有人来照顾她。”

“第一个理由你只是在炫耀，第二个理由是空话，第三个才是真正的原因。看来你已经任由她摆布了。”

他的双眼在他那副大眼镜下温和地闪烁着。

“你这家伙，什么事都能一眼看穿。”

“你现在不仅对她百依百顺，而且还为此扬扬得意。”

“明天过来吃午饭，认识认识她。她长得挺好看的。”

查理是一家不限男女的俱乐部的会员。那时我也经常出入这家俱乐部。我们约定明天在那里吃饭。我发现马热丽是一个非常吸引人的年轻女人，那时她快满三十了，很有修养。这让我很满意，同时也有几分吃惊。因为查理通常只对那些不太有教养的女人感兴趣，这一点逃不过我的眼睛。她的长相虽说不上多好，但挺标致，有一头漂亮的黑发和一双漂亮的眼睛。肤色白皙，看起来很健康。她说话非常率直，让人听起来很舒服。她看起来是一个诚实、单纯、可信任的人。我立马就喜欢上了她。她很容易交谈，对于别人所说的，虽然她并没有什么独到见解，但她马上就能领悟其中的可笑之处，而且她还是一个爽朗之人。她留给人们的印象是能干和务实。她的快活平和说明她有一个好脾气，而且悟性很高。

他们俩似乎对彼此非常满意。我第一次见到她时，曾自问：为什么马热丽要嫁给这样一个脾气暴躁的小个子男人？他不仅已经开始谢顶，而且也不年轻了。但我很快就发现了答案，她爱这个男人。他俩经常互相揶揄，然后哈哈大笑；他俩的目光不时相对，眼神意味深长，似乎在传递只有他俩才能理解的信息。这真是令人感动呢。

一个星期后，他俩就在一家结婚登记处办理了结婚手续。这桩婚姻非常美满。十六年后的现在回味起来，想到嬉闹使他俩结合在一起，我还禁不住要同情地窃笑一番。我从未见过如此恩爱有加的一对夫妇，虽然经济上始终不很宽裕，但却其乐融融。他们没有什么远大的抱负，生活对他们而言就像一次永远不会结束的野餐。他俩住在潘通大街的一处公寓内，是我所见过的最小的公寓，包括一间小卧室、一间小客厅和一间厨卫并用的房间。但他俩没有家的观念。他们通常去饭馆吃饭，只有早点才在公寓吃。这里只是他俩睡觉的地方。他们的小家布置得很舒适，只是来个客人喝杯掺苏打水的威士忌时，房间就会显得有点儿拥挤了。马热丽雇了一个按日付薪的清洁女工，将房间打扫得非常整洁。只是查理邋遢惯了，对此感到有些不大适应。室内的所有设施几乎都是两人共用的。他俩还有一辆微型轿车，只要查理休假，他俩就会钻进汽车穿过海峡，开始旅行。每人一个大袋子就能把所有的行李都打包好，想上哪儿就上哪儿。如果路上车坏了他俩也从不烦恼，遇到了坏天气也当作一件开心的事，就是轮胎爆了，他们也只当是又出了一桩笑话，如果迷了路，不得不在野外过夜，他俩就会把这视为最快活的一天。

查理仍然是好争论，脾气暴躁，但马热丽总能保持着平和的态度。她一句话就能使他冷静下来，再说几句就能使他笑起来。她为他关于鲜为人知的细菌的专著打字，从科学杂志中寻找资料。有一次我问他们吵过架没有。

“没有，”她回答道，“我俩似乎从来没有什么要吵的。查理的脾气好极了。”

“胡说，”我反驳道，“他是个蛮横、好斗、脾气暴躁的家伙，他一直都是这样。”

她看看自己的丈夫，咯咯地笑了。我明白她认为我是在开玩笑。

“让他胡言乱语，”查理说道，“他是个无知透顶的笨蛋，他甚至都不知道自己在胡说些什么。”

他俩在一起的时候非常甜蜜，非常享受对方的陪伴。他俩尽可能地待在一起。即使在结婚很久之后，查理依旧每天中午开车到城西，与马热丽在一家餐厅一起用餐。如果有人请他俩到乡间去度个周末，马热丽就会写信给女主人，询问是否能为他俩准备一张双人床。如果行的话，他俩就会欣然接受邀请。人们常常为此有点儿阴阳怪气地善意取笑他俩。他俩在一起睡了这么多年，但还是不能分床睡。一般人可能都会对此感到有点儿尴尬。通常来说，丈夫与妻子不仅会在各自的卧室睡觉，如果要让他们共用一个卫生间，他们恐怕都会不高兴。现在一般人家的卧室都是单人间，但如果你要邀请毕肖普夫妇到你家做客暂住的话，一定要准备一个有双人床的客房。这在他俩的朋友圈子中已经人所共知。当然有些人认为他俩这样做不大合适，但满足他俩的这个要求并不麻烦。而且他们夫妇俩都讨人喜欢，满足他们的这个怪癖还是值得的。查理总是精神头十足，刻薄的说话方式很是风趣，马热丽娴静而随和，能请到他俩来做客，是一件让人感到快活的事情。而对他俩而言，没有什么能比两人在乡间漫步更惬意的了，他俩常常会走很远。

一个男人结婚后，他的妻子迟早会使他疏远他的老朋友，但马热丽反而使查理与朋友们的关系更近了。她不仅使他变得更能容忍别人，也使他成为一个更合群的人。让人忍俊不禁的是，他俩不像是一对已婚的夫妇，倒像是一对在一起生活的中年光棍。一般情况下都是六七个男人在争论和打趣，开着下流玩笑，而只有马热丽一个女人陪着他们。她在场不仅不会使他们感到拘束，反而使他们更开心。只要我回到英国，我肯定会去看望他俩。他们一般都在我前面提到的俱乐部吃饭。如果我有空的话，我就会与他俩一起用餐。

那天傍晚我与他们夫妇俩一起用过点心，之后我们又一起玩了一会儿。我告诉他俩，我已经邀请莫顿过来吃晚饭。

“他这个人可能有点儿乏味，”我解释道，“但他是一个很不错的小伙子。我在婆罗洲的时候，他待我非常好。”

“你为什么不早点儿告诉我？”马热丽嚷道，“这样我就会带个姑娘来的。”

“找个姑娘来干吗？”查理说，“这里不有你嘛。”

“我想，让一个小伙子跟我这么大岁数的女人跳舞，他不会很开心。”马热丽说。

“胡说八道！你的岁数跟跳舞有什么关系！”查理转过身来对我说道，“跟你跳过舞的女人中，有比她跳得更好的吗？”

答案当然是肯定的了，但她跳舞跳得确实很好，舞步非常轻盈，而且节奏感把握得非常好。

“从来没有。”我语气诚恳地说道。

我们三人到达席罗兹俱乐部的时候，莫顿已经在那里等着我们了。他穿着晚礼服，显得肤色更黑了。也许是我知道这些西装已经在一口铁皮箱中，伴着樟脑丸躺了四年的缘故，我总觉得他穿着西装有些不自然。他肯定还是身着卡其布的短衣短裤更感轻松自在一些。查理·毕肖普是个健谈的人，喜欢一个人说个不停，而莫顿却有几分腼腆。我给他要了一杯鸡尾酒，还要了点儿香槟。我感觉他会很乐意跳舞，但不知他是否想到可以请马热丽跳。我深深地感觉到了我们之间的代沟。

“我想我应该告诉你，毕肖普夫人可是一位出色的舞者。”

“是吗？”他有点儿脸红，“能否请您跳支舞？”

她站了起来，两人开始跳舞。那天晚上她的衣着看起来不仅是时髦，简直可以用绝美一词来形容了。我估计她那身很普通的黑色服装价值顶多不过六个金币，但穿在她身上，却使她显得像个贵妇人。她的腿形非常好看，而当时流行穿非常短的裙子，因此她得以受益其中。我想她可能化了点儿淡妆，但与其他女人相比，她看起来非常自然。她很适合短发，头发乌黑锃亮，没有一根白发夹杂其中。她的长相称不上漂亮，但她待人的亲切态度，她精神饱满的神态，她健康的身体都给你一种感觉，即便你没觉得她是一个漂亮的女人，至少也会认为她漂不漂亮都无关紧要。她跳完舞回到座位上后，双眼闪闪发光，脸色绯红。

“他跳得怎么样？”她丈夫问道。

“好极了。”

“您的舞也跳得很好，与您搭配非常轻松。”莫顿说道。

查理继续他滔滔不绝的演讲。他说起话来幽默讽刺，他之所以让人感到有趣，就是因为连他都对自己说的话兴趣盎然。但莫顿对他所说的话一无所知，尽管他出于礼貌摆出一副感兴趣的样子，但我可以看得出，欢快的气氛让他非常激动，他更关注音乐和香槟，而不是谈话。当舞曲声再次响起来的时候，他立即探寻地瞅瞅马热丽。查理捕捉到了他的目光，微笑起来。

“再跟他跳一曲，马热丽。看你跳舞对我的身体也有好处。”

他俩又去跳舞了。查理用爱恋的眼神瞅了她一眼。

“马热丽今天很开心。她非常喜欢跳舞，可我跟她跳舞就喘不上气来。这个小伙子不错。”

我的小派对很成功。当我和莫顿同毕肖普夫妇告别后，我俩一同步行前往皮卡迪利广场。在路上他非常真切地对我表示了感谢，他说他过得真的很愉快。我同他道了别。第二天早上，我就出国了。





我很遗憾自己没法为莫顿做多点儿事。我知道等我回到英国的时候，他可能正在返回婆罗洲的路上。我不时会想起他。但等到秋天我回到英国后，我已经完全忘记他了。大约在我回到伦敦一个星期后的一天晚上，我偶然到查理·毕肖普也是会员的那家俱乐部去玩，看到查理正与三四个我认识的男人坐在一起，我便走上前去。我这次回来后还没见过他们。其中一个人叫比尔·马什，他的妻子珍妮特是我的老朋友。他邀请我一起喝一杯。

“你上哪儿去了？”查理问道，“最近一直没有看到你。”

我立刻注意到查理喝醉了，我非常吃惊。查理喜欢喝酒，但他很有分寸，从来都不会喝过头。我俩都很年轻的时候，他偶尔也喝醉过，或许这件事比任何事都能说明他是一个多么伟大的人，况且把一个人年轻时偶尔喝过量的事翻出来是不公平的。但在我的记忆中，查理只要喝醉了就会丑态百出，他会更具攻击性，会变成一个声如洪钟的话痨，很容易跟人吵起来。他现在就是这样，说话武断，拒绝听取任何关于他鲁莽言辞的反对意见。其他人知道他喝醉了，一方面对他无理搅三分的劲儿感到生气，一方面又觉得既然他喝醉了，就不要与他计较了。他是一个很难相处的家伙。他这么大岁数了，有点儿发福，还秃了顶，戴着一副眼镜，却醉得一塌糊涂。他通常都是一副衣冠楚楚的模样，但现在却如此衣衫不整，全身沾满了烟灰。查理叫了服务生，又点了一杯威士忌。这个服务生已经在这家俱乐部工作了三十年。

“您桌上还有一杯呢，先生。”

“让你干啥你就干啥，”查理·毕肖普说道，“马上给我拿两杯威士忌来，否则我就要投诉你怠慢客人。”

“好吧，先生。”服务生说道。

查理端起桌上那杯威士忌，一饮而尽。但他的手有些颤抖，因此洒了一些酒在身上。

“好了，查理，老伙计，咱们该走了。”比尔·马什说道，然后他转身对我说，“查理今天来这里的时间不长。”

现在我感到更惊讶了，但我觉得有些地方不对劲儿，想着最好还是什么都不说。

“我这就走，”查理说，“但我走之前要再喝一杯。这样我今晚就能睡个好觉了。”

在我看来这个聚会没有马上散伙的意思，因此我站了起来，说我想走着回家了。

“我说，”看我要走，比尔说道，“明天晚上你过来跟我们一起吃饭，好不好？就我、珍妮特和查理三个人。”

“好的，我很高兴过来。”我答应道。

显然出了什么岔子。

马什夫妇住在摄政公园东侧的一排住房内，为我开门的女佣让我到马什先生的书房去，他正在那里等我。

“我想我最好还是在你上楼前跟你唠几句，”他一面与我握手一面说道，“你知道马热丽把查理给甩了吗？”

“当然不知道！”

“他对这始终不能释怀。珍妮特认为让他自己一个人郁郁寡欢地待在那套小公寓里太残酷了，因此我俩邀请了他到我们这里住一段时间。我们尽可能地为他料理好一切。他现在酗酒成狂，他已经失眠两个星期了。”

“她不会永远离开他吧？”

我感到非常震惊。

“她是要这样。为了一个叫莫顿的家伙，她简直疯了。”

“莫顿？哪个莫顿？”

我压根儿没想到他会是我在婆罗洲认识的那个朋友。

“该死的，就是你介绍的他，看你做的好事。现在咱俩上楼去，我想最好还是让你先明白一下自己的处境。”

他推开门，我俩走出了书房。我彻底糊涂了。

“可是，听我说。”我说。

“去问珍妮特，她了解整件事情。这件事真让我莫名其妙。我现在真受不了马热丽，查理这下肯定垮了。”

他引着我走进客厅。我进屋后，珍妮特·马什站起身，走上前来欢迎我。查理正坐在窗边看晚报，看我正朝他走去，他就把报纸放到一边，同我握握手。他十分清醒，说话依然是那种快活的语气，但我注意到他看起来状态很差。我们喝了一杯雪利酒，然后走下楼去吃饭。珍妮特是个精力十足的女人，她个子高挑，容貌姣好，她机警地使谈话持续进行下去。当我们几个男人要去喝杯葡萄酒的时候，她命令我们不许超过十分钟。比尔平时是一个沉默寡言的人，现在却在千方百计找话说。我恍然大悟。我刚才光顾着想到底出了什么事，却没有意会到他们夫妇的苦心。显然，马什夫妇是不想让查理陷入沉思，因此，我也尽力说些有趣的事。查理似乎也愿意尽量配合我们，他总是喜欢滔滔不绝地说个没完。现在，他正站在一个病理学家的角度，探讨最近公众热议的一起谋杀案，但他的话听起来干巴巴的。看来他现在干什么都没有心思了。你会感觉到他为了回应主人的好意正强迫自己说话，但他的心思却在别的地方。头顶上的地板令人欣慰地跺响了，这是珍妮特不耐烦的信号。这种场合最需要一个女人来缓解气氛了。我们走上楼去，一起打了会儿桥牌。时间很晚了，当我要与他们告别的时候，查理说他要送我到马里波恩路。

“查理，现在太晚了，你最好还是上床睡觉吧。”珍妮特说道。

“我睡觉前散散步，能睡得实一些。”他回答道。

她有些担心地瞅瞅他。但一个年岁已到中年的病理学教授要想出去走走，你是拦不住的。她眼睛一亮，瞥了一眼她丈夫。

“我想让比尔去散散步也无妨。”

我想这句话不大明智，女人们通常有点儿太爱管事。查理不高兴地瞅了她一眼。

“完全没必要把比尔也拖出去。”他口气坚决地说道。

“我一点儿也不想出去。”比尔笑着说道，“我累坏了，我要上床睡觉了。”

我想，我俩出去后，比尔·马什跟他妻子一定会拌几句嘴。

“他们俩对我真是太好了。”当我俩沿着栅栏向前走去的时候，查理对我说，“如果没有他们，我真不知道自己会干出什么蠢事来。我有两个星期没有合眼了。”

我对此表示遗憾，但并没有询问原因。我俩就这样静静地走了一段路。我猜他和我一起出来是想要告诉我这件事的来龙去脉，但我感觉他并不急于讲述。我渴望表达我的同情，但又担心说错话，我不想让自己看上去就像要从他那里获取信心一样。我不知道该怎样引导他说这件事，我相信他也不需要别人去引导，他不是一个说话爱绕圈子的人。我想他是在考虑怎么说才好。我们走到了街道的拐角处。

“你可以在前面的教堂打到出租车，”他说，“我要再溜达一会儿。晚安。”

他点点头，然后没精打采地走了。我大吃一惊，却又无可奈何，只能继续向前走，直到打到一辆出租车。第二天早上我正在洗澡，电话铃声响了起来。我在身上裹了一条毛巾，浑身湿漉漉地跑出来接了电话。电话是珍妮特打来的。

“好吧，你对这一切怎么看？”她问道，“看样子昨晚你跟查理一起待了很长时间啊。我听说他回家的时候已经凌晨三点了。”

“他在马里波恩大街就跟我分手了，”我回答道，“他什么也没跟我说。”

“是吗？”

珍妮特的语气中透露出她想要跟我长唠一阵，我猜她用的是床边的电话。

“听着，”我赶紧说，“我正洗澡呢。”

“噢，你在洗澡间安了一部电话？”她热情地问道，我甚至觉得她还有点儿羡慕。

“没有。”我斩钉截铁地说，言语有点儿鲁莽，“我把地毯都弄湿了。”

“哦！”我感到她的语气中有些失望，还有一点儿不高兴，“好吧，什么时候我可以见你？你能在十二点的时候来一趟吗？”

这个时间不太方便，但我不打算跟她争辩了。

“可以，再见。”

我不容她再说什么就把电话挂断了。天堂里的人们打电话时肯定也是一句废话也没有。

我很喜欢珍妮特，但我知道没什么事比她的朋友遭遇不幸更能让她兴奋的了。她只是太急于帮助他们，但她总想深入参与到他们的不幸之中。她是那种患难之交，她愿意卷入别人遇上的麻烦事，乐此不疲。如果你卷入了一场风流韵事，你会发现不知怎的她就成了你的红颜知己，或者如果你在闹离婚，你也会发现她多半会插一手。加之她的确是一个很不错的女人。第二天中午，当我被领进珍妮特的客厅时，她急不可耐地接待我的样子，让我不禁心中暗笑。她为毕肖普所遭遇的不幸大感悲痛，但这件事很刺激，能有一个让她把整件事的来龙去脉都一一相告的人，她简直高兴得要死。珍妮特期待这场谈话，就像一个母亲期待与家庭医生讨论她已婚女儿的第一次分娩一样。珍妮特知道这件事很严重，她也从未轻看这件事，她打定主意要从这件事中挖掘出所有的快乐。

“我想，当马热丽告诉我，她已经打定主意要与查理分手时，没有谁比我更感震惊了。”她非常流利地说道。一个人只有一字不落地把这句话至少说上十来遍，才能达到这种流利程度。“他俩是我所认识的人中关系最密切的一对了。他们一见如故，缔结了一桩美满的婚姻。当然，比尔和我的关系很不错，但我俩也要不时地大吵一顿。我想，我有时真想杀了他。”

“我对你与比尔的关系一点儿兴趣都没有，”我说道，“跟我说说毕肖普夫妇的关系吧。我过来就是想听这个的。”

“我只是感觉得要见见你，毕竟你是唯一能把这件事解释清楚的人。”

“噢，上帝，千万别这么说。如果不是前天晚上比尔告诉我，我对这件事一无所知。”

“是我让他先告诉你的。我突然想到你也许还不知道这件事，我担心你冒冒失失地说错话。”

“你就从头说起吧。”我说道。

“好吧，就从你开始吧。不管怎么说，你是这场麻烦的始作俑者，你向他俩介绍了那个年轻人，这也是我为什么急着见你的原因。你非常了解这个人，而我从来没有见过他，我对他的了解全来自于马热丽告诉我的那些话。”

“你几点吃午饭？”我问道。

“一点半。”

“我也是。接着讲这个故事吧。”

但我的话使珍妮特有了一个主意。

“听我说，如果我退掉我的午餐的话，你会退掉你的吗？我们可以在这里吃点儿便餐。我这里还有一些冷盘肉，这样我们就不用着急了。我三点钟去做头发，这样我们就有的是时间了。”

“别，别，别。”我连忙拒绝，“我不同意这个主意。我至多只能待到一点二十分。”

“那我就只能简单说了。你认为格里这个人怎么样？”

“谁是格里？”

“格里·莫顿。他的名字叫杰拉尔德。”

“这我哪知道？”

“你跟他在一起待过。他的住处没有什么信件吗？”

“可能有，但我不可能碰巧去读这些信。”我有些尖锐地回答道。

“别说这样的蠢话了，我指的是信封。他是一个什么样的人？”

“好吧。他有点儿像吉卜林，你知道这个类型的人是什么样。他工作非常卖力，为人真诚，是为大英帝国扩张疆土立下汗马功劳的人。”

“我说的不是这个意思。”珍妮特有点儿不耐烦地大声喊道，“我是说，他长得怎么样？”

“我想，他长得很普通。当然，如果我再次见到他，我应该还能认出他来，但我无法非常清晰地把他描绘出来。他看起来很干净。”

“噢，上帝，”珍妮特喊道，“你还是不是一个小说家了？他的眼睛是什么颜色的？”

“我不知道。”

“你肯定知道。你跟任何一个人在一起待上一个星期，都不可能不知道他的眼睛是蓝色还是棕色，他的皮肤是黑还是白？”

“既不太黑，也不太白。”

“他的个子是高还是矮？”

“我想应该算中等个儿吧。”

“你是故意想惹我发火吗？”

“绝对不是。他就是很普通，他身上没有任何地方能引起你的注意。他长得既不丑，也算不上英俊。他看起来很正派，像是个绅士。”

“马热丽说他长得很可爱，笑起来很迷人。”

“可能是这样。”

“他疯狂地爱上了她。”

“你是怎么得出这个结论的？”我冷淡地问道。

“我看过他写的信了。”

“你是说她把他写的信都给你看了？”

“这有什么奇怪吗？当然是了。”

对于一个男人来讲，他们很难忍受女人们将他们的隐私泄露给他人。这些女人真是不知廉耻，她们可以在一起谈论男女间最私密的事情而丝毫不感到尴尬。庄重是男性特有的美德，尽管一个男人知道这一点，但每逢女人们做出缺乏矜持之事的时候，他还是感到极为震惊。不仅是他的信件被马热丽和珍妮特·马什读了，而且连他迷恋于她的状况马丽热也逐日随时告知了珍妮特，我真想知道莫顿要是知道了这个情况，他会怎么想。根据珍妮特的描述，他对马热丽是一见钟情。他俩在席罗兹俱乐部我的那个小型晚餐聚会上相识后的第二天早上，他就给她打电话，邀请她过来，找一个能跳舞的地方跟他一起喝茶。我一边听着珍妮特的故事，一边想，她的叙述显然是根据马热丽的描述而来。我决定不带偏见地听下去。让我感兴趣的是，珍妮特同情的一方居然是马热丽。当马热丽抛弃了她的丈夫后，让查理过来跟他们一起住两三个星期是她的主意，她说免得他孤零零地待在那个小公寓内黯然伤神。珍妮特对查理照顾得也确实非常到位，几乎每天都陪他吃午饭，因为他已经习惯了每天都与马热丽一起吃午饭。她每天都陪他到摄政公园散步，让比尔在周日陪他打高尔夫球。她非常耐心地听他讲自己不幸的故事，尽可能地给他抚慰。她为他感到非常难过，但她照样明确地站在马热丽一边。当我表示不赞成她这样的做法时，她狠狠地训了我一顿。这件事让她非常兴奋。从一开始马热丽面有得色又犹疑不决地到她这里，微笑着告诉她，自己有了一个相好的年轻人，到最后马热丽怒气冲冲又心神不宁地来到她这里，宣布自己再也无法忍受这种压力，已经带着自己的行李离开了公寓，她都参与其中。

“当然，起初我也无法相信自己的耳朵。”她解释道，“你非常了解查理与马热丽，他俩简直就是形影不离，关系亲密到连别人都禁不住要笑话他们了。他这样一个矮小的男人，我从来都不认为有什么吸引力，但我无法不喜欢他，因为他对马热丽太好了。我有时甚至有些嫉妒她。他们没有钱，住的地方也是一片混乱，但他们非常快活。当然，我从没想过他俩的关系会出现问题。马热丽也只是把这当作一件有趣的事而已。‘我自然没有非常认真地对待这件事。’她对我说，‘但到了我这个年龄还能和一个年轻人在一起真的很有趣。已经有好多年没人给我送鲜花了。我告诉他不要再送了，因为查理会认为这样太愚蠢了。他在伦敦没有任何亲人和朋友，而且他喜欢跳舞。他说跟我跳舞就像在做一场梦。他总是自己一个人去电影院，真是太凄惨了。我俩一起看了两次日场电影。每次我答应与他一起出去时，他那副感激的样子真是太可怜了。’‘我得说，’我说，‘他听起来像只小羊羔。’‘没错，’她说，‘我知道你能理解我。你不会责怪我的，对吧？’‘当然不会，亲爱的。’我这样回答她，‘你对我还不了解吗？我要是处在你这样的情况下，也会这样做的。’”

马热丽并没有向她丈夫隐瞒她与莫顿出去游玩的事，而查理也只是打趣她对他的小男友温厚有加，但他认为莫顿是一个非常彬彬有礼、讲话讨人喜欢的小伙子，并且很高兴在自己忙碌的时候，能有个人陪着马热丽一起玩。他从未吃过莫顿的醋。他们三人还一起吃过几次饭，一起看了一场演出。但不久后，格里·莫顿恳求马热丽跟他独处一晚上。马热丽说这不可能，但他不断恳求，让她不得安宁。最后，有一天她找到珍妮特，让她帮忙给查理打电话，叫他晚上过来吃饭，并告诉他要打桥牌，独缺他一人。查理从不在晚上撇开妻子，一个人外出。但马什夫妇是他的老朋友了，而珍妮特又特别重视这件事。珍妮特编造了一些荒诞无稽的借口，让这个聚会看起来很重要，使查理无法缺席。第二天马热丽与她见了面，告诉她昨晚妙极了。他俩一起在梅登黑德饭店吃的饭，还跳了舞，然后在夏日的深夜开车回家。

“他说他疯狂地迷上了我。”马热丽这样告诉她。

“他吻你了吗？”珍妮特问道。

“当然吻了。”马热丽咯咯地笑道，“别说傻话了，珍妮特。他非常可爱，性格非常好。当然，我并不全信他对我说的话。”

“亲爱的，你不会爱上他了吧？”

“我已经爱上他了。”马热丽回答说。

“亲爱的，这不是要有点儿难办了吗？”

“这场恋情不会很长的，他秋天就要返回婆罗洲。”

“噢，你现在看上去确实年轻了好几岁。”

“这我知道，我也感觉自己年轻了好几岁。”

没过多久他俩就每天见面了。他俩在上午见面，然后一起到公园去散步，或者一起去美术馆。中午时分他俩就会分开，因为马热丽要陪她丈夫一起吃午饭。午餐后他俩又会一起开车去郊外兜风，或者开到河边的一处地方。这些事马热丽没有告诉她丈夫，她很自然地认为他无法理解。

“你怎么就从来没有见过莫顿呢？”我问珍妮特。

“哦，是她不让我见。你看，我跟马热丽属于同一代人，我完全能理解她的这个做法。”

“我明白了。”

“当然，我是尽可能帮她的忙。只要她跟格里出去时，她总是借口上我这儿来。”

我是一个非常注重细节的人。

“他们俩就没有做出轨的事吗？”我问道。

“哦，没有。马热丽不是那种人。”

“你怎么知道的？”

“如果真有这种事，她会告诉我的。”

“我猜她应该干了这样的事。”

“我当然问过她，但她断然否认了。我相信她对我说的是实话。他俩之间从来没有发生这类事。”

“对我来说这似乎有点儿难以理解。”

“好吧，你要知道，马热丽是一个很好的女人。”

我耸了耸肩膀。

“她对查理绝对忠诚，无论如何她都不会欺骗他，她不能忍受自己有任何瞒着查理的念头。当她意识到自己爱上了格里时，她马上就想把这件事告诉查理。我当然恳求她别这样做，我告诉她，这样做没有任何好处，只会让查理伤心。不管怎么说，这个小伙子两个月后就要走了，把一件不会持续很长时间的事闹得满城风雨不会有什么好处。”

但格里返程的日子越来越近，这促使了这个事件的爆发。毕肖普夫妇早已计划像往常一样出国去旅行，他们这次打算驾车穿越比利时、荷兰和德国北部。查理忙着寻找各地的地图和旅游手册，他从朋友们那里收集有关旅馆和道路的信息。他盼着自己的这个假期，像一个中学生一样兴奋不已。马热丽沮丧地听着他议论这次旅行。他俩要离开四个星期，而格里九月份就要乘船走了。她与格里在一起的时间本来就不长了，现在又要浪费掉这么长一段时间，这让她难以忍受。她一想起这趟驾车旅行就满腔怒火，随着假期一天天逼近，她的情绪也越来越不安。最终，她决定只能跟他摊牌了。

“查理，我不想进行这次旅行了。”一天，他正在跟她谈论刚听人说起的一家餐厅时，她突然打断了他的话，“我希望你找别人跟你一起去。”

他目瞪口呆地望着她。她也对自己刚才脱口而出的话感到吃惊，她的嘴唇微微颤抖起来。

“为什么？出什么事了吗？”

“没什么事，我就是不想去了，我想自己一个人待一段时间。”

“你生病了吗？”

她从他的眼神中看到了突然降临的恐惧，他的关心使她更加难以忍受。

“没有，我的人生中从未这么好过。我爱上了一个人。”

“你？你爱上谁了？”

“格里。”

他极为震惊地看着她，无法相信自己的耳朵。而她误解了他的表情。

“责怪我也没有用，我不由自主地就爱上了他。他几个星期后就要走了，我不想把这点儿宝贵的时间浪费掉。”他突然大笑起来。

“马热丽，你怎么这么傻呀？你的岁数差不多可以做他的母亲了。”她的脸红了。

“他也同样爱我。”

“他是这样告诉你的吗？”

“他这样说了无数遍。”

“他是一个该死的骗子，就是这么回事。”

他咯咯地笑个不停，他的胖肚子乐得直抖，他认为这是一个天大的笑话。我猜查理没有以恰当的方式对待他的妻子。珍妮特似乎认为查理应该表现出体贴和同情的态度，他应该理解这件事。我看到了她内心所想的场景：查理嘴唇紧绷，默默地伤心，最后宣布两人断绝关系。女人对他人表现出来的自我牺牲之美总是非常敏感。如果他勃然大怒，打碎一两件家什（当然，他还会买一件新的补上），或者朝马热丽的下巴重重地打上一拳，珍妮特也会对他表示同情。但嘲笑她却是不可原谅的错误。我没有指出，对于一个矮胖的、年龄已达五十五岁的病理学教授而言，要让他像一个洞穴人一样对突然的变故做出反应，这也太难了一点儿。不管怎么说，他俩预定去荷兰的旅行取消了，毕肖普夫妇在伦敦度过了八月份。他俩都不怎么开心。他俩的中饭和晚饭依然在一起吃，因为这么多年来他们早已习惯如此。而其余的时间马热丽都与格里一起度过。她与他在一起的时间极大地弥补了她所忍受的痛苦。查理喜欢开粗俗的玩笑，对她和格里百般挖苦、千般嘲弄，以此为乐事。他坚持拒绝严肃地对待这件事情。他很生马热丽的气，因为她如此愚蠢，但显然他从未想过她会不忠于自己。对此，我与珍妮特有不同的看法。

“他甚至从未怀疑这一点。”她说，“他太了解马热丽了。”

几个星期过去了，格里终于搭船离开了。他是从蒂尔伯里[4]上的船，马热丽为他送了行。她回来后哭了两天两夜。查理看着她，愈来愈生气，他的脾气变得非常暴躁。

“听我说，马热丽，”最后他说道，“我对你一直很有耐心，但现在你必须重新振作起来。这件事已经超过开玩笑的限度了。”

“你就不能让我自己待一会儿吗？”她喊道，“我什么都没有了，生活对我而言已经没有什么意义了。”

“别再犯傻了。”他说。

我不知道他还说了些别的什么话，但他将自己对格里的评价说给她听真是太不明智了。我推测他一定是用极其恶毒的语言描述了格里。他俩大吵了一架。以前他俩从未这样激烈地争吵过。她过去之所以能够忍受查理的冷嘲热讽，是因为她知道，再过一个小时或一天，她就又能见到格里了。而现在她永远也见不到格里了，她再也无法忍受这样的语言刺激了。她已经忍耐了几个星期，现在，她把自我控制抛到九霄云外去了，也许她根本就不知道自己都对查理喊了些什么。他本来就是一个脾气暴躁的人，最后他动手打了她一巴掌。这一巴掌将两人都吓了一跳。他抓起帽子，转身冲出了公寓。婚后尽管生活艰辛，但他们始终共享着一张床。但当他后半夜返回家中后，他发现她在客厅的沙发上为自己搭了一个地铺。

“你不能睡在这儿，”他说道，“别犯傻了，到床上睡去。”

“不，我不会去的。别管我。”

这一晚他俩接着争吵。但她已经打定主意，以后每晚都在沙发上睡。但公寓这么小，他俩谁也逃离不了对方，甚至对方的一举一动自己都能看见，对方说的话也都会灌进自己的耳朵里。他俩在一起亲密无间地生活了这么多年，出于本能他俩也要待在一起。他试图跟她讲清道理。他认为她傻得令人不可思议，不断跟她争吵，想要让她知道自己是多么执迷不悟。他不让她自己一个人待着，也不让她睡觉。他一讲就讲到后半夜，直到两人都筋疲力尽为止。他认为他能通过讲道理让她摆脱这场爱情。有一次，他俩两三天时间彼此都没有说话。一天，他回家后发现她正在痛哭。看到她在流泪，他乱了方寸。他告诉她，自己多么爱她。他回忆起两人这么多年来所度过的幸福时光，试图用这个办法来感动她。他想让这件事就这样过去。他许诺再也不提起格里了。他俩真的能忘记经历的这场噩梦吗？但这种隐含和解的想法使她感到恶心了。她对他说，自己头痛欲裂，让他给她拿瓶安眠药水来。第二天早上他出门的时候，她还假装在睡着。但他一离开家门，她就将自己的东西打包好，离开了公寓。她有几件继承来的廉价首饰，变卖掉这些首饰后，她手上有了一小笔钱。她在一家廉价寄宿公寓内租了一间屋，没有告诉查理自己的住址。

查理发现马热丽离开自己后就垮了，她的逃离所带来的打击彻底击溃了他。他告诉珍妮特，自己无法忍受这种孤独。他给马热丽写信，乞求她回来；他请珍妮特为他求情，他愿意做出任何保证，他卑躬屈膝，但马热丽执拗地不愿回去。

“你认为她终有一天会回去吗？”我问珍妮特。

“她说绝不回去。”

现在已经是近一点半了，我必须走了。我驾车向伦敦城另一端驶去。





两三天后，我收到了一通马热丽的电话留言，她问我能否见她一面，提议到我的住处来。我招待她喝了茶。我尽量对她表现得友好一些，虽说她的风流韵事与我无关，但我发自内心地认为她是一个愚蠢的女人。我猜自己的态度挺冷漠的。她的长相从来也称不上漂亮，流逝的岁月也改变不了这一点。她的一双黑眼睛还是那样好看，让人感到吃惊的是，她脸上一点儿皱纹都没有。她的穿着很普通，要是化了妆的话，那就太在行了，反正我没有看出来。她仍然透着那么一种魅力，让你觉得她是一个非常自然的人，一个和蔼中带着幽默的人。

“如果你愿意的话，我想请你为我做件事。”她开门见山，一点儿也不拐弯抹角。

“什么事？”

“查理今天就要离开马什夫妇的家，回到自己的公寓了，我担心他头几天会很难过，如果你能请他吃晚饭或陪他活动活动，那就太好了。”

“我得看看我的书。”

“据说他现在喝酒喝得很凶。他是在作践自己。我希望你能提醒提醒他。”

“据我所知，他最近是在为家里的事烦恼。”我说话的语气可能有几分讥讽的味道。

马热丽的脸红了，她痛苦地看了我一眼。她的脸部扭曲着，就好像我刚才给了她一拳似的。

“当然，你认识他的时间要远远超过认识我的时间，所以你自然会站在他的一边。”

“天哪，告诉你实话吧。这些年来我之所以熟悉了他，主要还是你的缘故呢。我从来都不太喜欢他，但我认为你的为人非常好。”

她对我笑了，她的笑容很甜。她知道我这个人说一不二。

“你认为对他而言我算是个好妻子吗？”

“绝对。”

“他经常惹得别人不高兴，很多人都不喜欢他，但我从来都没觉得他难处。”

“他非常喜欢你。”

“这我知道。我俩在一起的时候很美好。十六年来我俩都过得很幸福。”她停顿了一下，目光渐渐下移，“我不得不离开他，我俩不可能再在一起了，这种鸡犬不宁的生活太可怕了。”

“我从来都不明白为什么不想一起生活的两个人还要继续一起生活下去。”

“你瞧，这对我俩来说太可怕了。我俩的关系一直都非常亲密，从来都是难舍难弃。结果，现在我却不愿多看他一眼。”

“我想，目前你俩的处境都不容易。”

“我爱上了他人，这并非我的过错。你瞧，这与我对查理的爱完全不同。我对格里的爱包含着母爱，意在对他进行保护。我比查理要理性得多。他这个人很难相处，但我跟他相处得一直都很好。但格里不同。”她的声音变得温柔起来，她的面容也出现了光彩，因而显得有些漂亮了，“他让我重返青春了。对他来说我是个女孩，跟他在一起我有一种可以依靠的感觉，感到很安全。”

“我也认为他是一个不错的小伙子。”我语速很慢地说道，“我想他以后会过得很好的。我遇见他的时候，他的年纪于他所从事的工作而言着实太年轻了。他现在也才刚二十九岁，是不是？”

她温柔地笑了。她知道我说的是什么意思。

“我从未对他隐瞒过自己的年龄，他说这没有关系。”

我知道她说的是实情，她不是那种刻意隐瞒自己年龄的女人。她在告诉格里自己年龄的时候，曾感到这是一件极为快乐的事情。

“你今年多大了？”

“四十四岁。”

“现在你打算怎么办呢？”

“我已经给格里写了信，告诉他我已经离开了查理。只要我一收到他的回信，我就打算去跟他一起生活。”

“你要知道，他住在一个非常原始的小部落。我恐怕你会发现自己处于一个极为尴尬的位置。”

“他向我保证，如果在他离开之后我无法找到自己的生活，就去找他。”

“你将一个年轻人在爱的冲动下所说的话当真，做出了如此重大的决定，你确信这样明智吗？”

极度兴奋的表情又出现在她脸上，让她看起来真的很漂亮了。“是的，当这个年轻人碰巧是格里的时候。”

我的心情很沉重，我沉默了一会儿，然后向她讲了格里·莫顿督建那条公路的故事。我讲的有点儿夸张，我想这样效果会更好一些。

“你给我讲这个故事想说明什么呢？”我讲完后她这样问我。

“我只是想，这是一个不错的故事。”

她摇摇头，笑了。

“不，你是想通过这个故事来告诉我，他非常年轻，非常有热情。他是个工作狂，因此，他不会在其他兴趣上浪费太多时间。我不会影响他的工作。你对他的了解不如我，他非常浪漫，他将自己看成了一个开拓者，他对于自己亲自参与了一个新国家的开发而激动不已，连我都被他感染了。这难道不是一桩宏伟的事业吗？与之相比，我们在这里的生活真的很无聊和平庸。当然，那里的生活非常孤独，甚至连有一个中年妇女陪伴都变得很不错。”

“你打算嫁给他吗？”我问道。

“我完全听他的，我不想做任何他不愿意做的事。”

她说的话非常简洁，但她委曲求全的态度深深地打动了我。她走后，我感到自己已经不怨恨她了。当然，我依然认为她很愚蠢。但如果愚蠢的男人将一个女人惹怒了，那么这个女人将终其一生都处于长期愤怒的状态。我想一切都会过去的。她说格里非常浪漫，他确实如此，但在这个平凡的世界里，浪漫只是他们胡说八道的托词，因为他们实际上拥有一种敏锐的现实感，而最易受骗的则是那些只注重浪漫的表面意义而一意孤行的人。英国人很浪漫，所以其他国家的人都认为英国人虚伪。但英国人绝非都是些伪君子，他们是真心实意地想建立一个理想的天国。但这个过程是艰难的，英国人有理由在这个过程中学会任何能找到的稳当投资。英国人的心灵就像威灵顿将军旗下的大军一样，需要充足的物资保障。我想格里收到马热丽的信后会度过糟糕的十五分钟。我并非多么同情他，我只是想看他如何摆脱他所面临的这个困境。我想马热丽会经历一次痛不欲生的失望，好吧，这并不会对她造成太大的伤害，然后她就会回到她丈夫的身边。我相信经过这场磨难之后，他们俩会在一片和平、安宁和幸福之中度过余生。

这件事却不同寻常。碰巧最近几天我没可能与查理·毕肖普进行任何形式的约会，但我有写信给他，邀请他于下周的某个晚上跟我一起吃晚饭。虽然有些犹疑，但我还是提议饭后一起去看场戏剧。我知道他是个大酒鬼，如果喝高了，就会唠唠叨叨个没完。我希望他不会在剧院里被人讨厌。我们约定在我们所属的俱乐部碰头，七点左右开始吃饭。之所以定在这个时间，是因为我俩想去看的那场戏将在八点一刻开始演。我到了那里，坐下来等着他。但他没有来。我打电话到他公寓，也没人接，所以我估计他可能正在路上。我很烦错过戏剧的开头。我焦急地站在俱乐部的大厅等着，这样只要他一到，我俩就可以直接上楼了。为了节省时间，我已经点好了菜。时钟指向了七点半，然后是七点四十五。我认为没有必要再等下去了，因此就上楼进了餐厅，自己一个人吃了晚饭。他还是没有出现。我要了一个从餐厅接到马什夫妇家的电话，很快一个服务员过来告诉我，是比尔·马什接的电话。

“我说，你知道查理·毕肖普在哪里吗？”我说道，“我俩约好一起吃晚饭，然后去看戏，但他没来。”

“他今天下午死了。”

“什么？”

我大吃一惊，说话的语气引得周围两三个人都抬头看我。今天餐厅爆满，服务员都在不停地忙碌。电话放在收银员的柜台上。一名负责送酒水的服务员托着一个盘子走过来，盘子上放着一瓶霍克酒[5]和两个高脚玻璃杯，他递给收银员一张记账单。一个大块头服务员正引着两个男人前往一张餐桌，他挤了我一下。

“你在哪里打电话呢？”比尔问道。

我猜他听到了我周围盆盘刀叉撞击发出的声音。我告诉他后，他要我一吃完饭就马上到他那里去，说珍妮特有话要对我说。

“我马上过去。”我答应道。

我到达时比尔跟珍妮特正坐在客厅里，比尔在看报，珍妮特在玩单人纸牌游戏。当女佣把我领入后，她马上走了过来。她迈着跳跃的步伐，稍有点儿下蹲，但脚下不出动静，就像一头美洲狮在逼近猎物。我立即就看出来，她现在是如鱼得水，非常适应这种情况。她握住我的手，把脸扭到了一边，以免让我看到她溢满了眼泪的双眼。她说话的声音低沉，充满了悲痛之情。

“我把马热丽带回了我家，让她上床睡了。医生给她开了一剂安眠药，她全都服了进去。这件事太可怕了，是不是？”她说话的声音介于喘息和抽泣之间，“真不知为什么我的身边总出现这类事情。”

毕肖普夫妇一直没有雇做家务的用人，只是找了一个钟点工，每天早上过来打扫房间，清洗早饭后用过的刀叉碗碟等。钟点工有房门的钥匙。这天早上，她一如既往地打开房门，清扫客厅。自从他的妻子离开了他，查理的作息时间就变得非常混乱，因而看到他还在睡觉，她也没有感到意外。但上班的时间到了，她知道他需要去上班，还有工作等着他完成。她在卧室的门上敲了敲，但没有回答声。她认为自己听到他在呻吟，便急忙推开房门。他面朝上地躺在床上，打着呼噜。他还在睡着。她叫他，他身上的某些症状让她感到害怕。她来到对门的公寓，那里住着一名记者，她按门铃的时候他还在床上，穿着睡衣给她开了门。

“打搅您了，先生，”她说道，“您能不能过来一下，看看我的东家怎么了。我想他不大对劲。”

这个记者穿过过道，来到查理的公寓内。一个安眠药的空瓶子正放在床边。

“我想你最好还是找个警察来。”他说。

一个警察来了，他立即用电话向警局要了辆救护车。他们把毕肖普送到了查令十字街医院，但他再也没有恢复意识。他咽气的时候，马热丽陪在他的身边。

“警方当然要进行一番调查了，”珍妮特说道，“但这件事情很明显。最近三四个星期他严重失眠，我猜他一直在服用安眠药。他一定是意外地服用过量了。”

“马热丽也是这么认为的吗？”

“她的情绪非常不稳，脑子乱成了一锅粥，但我告诉她，我确信他不是自杀身亡的。我的意思是说，他不是这样想不开的人。我说得对吗，比尔？”

“没错，亲爱的。”

“他留下遗书没有？”

“没有，一个字都没有。奇怪的是，马热丽今天早上收到了他寄给她的一封信。哦，那几乎称不上一封信，就是一个字条。字条上只有一行字，‘亲爱的，没有你我太孤单了。’就这样。这张字条当然说明不了什么，她向我保证不对警察提这张字条的事。我的意思是说，让别人联想起其他事情来有什么好处？人人都知道，只要是扯上了安眠药，事情就说不清道不明了。不管出了什么事，我今后都不会服用安眠药了。这件事明显是个意外事故。我说得对吗，比尔？”

“没错，亲爱的。”他答道。

我看得出来，珍妮特坚信查理·毕肖普不是自杀而亡，但她内心里有几分相信她想去相信的事呢？我不是一个够格的女性心理学家，对此我分析不出来。当然，也许她是对的。一个中年科学家由于中年发妻离开了自己而自杀，这种假设太荒谬了。极有可能的情况是，由于饱受失眠的折磨，在极不理智的情况下，他服用了比他所想的剂量要大的安眠药。不管怎么说，验尸官的结论就是这样。他被告知，最近查理·毕肖普酗酒成瘾，导致了他妻子的离家出走。很明显，他求死心切。验尸官对死者的遗孀表达了同情，并反复强调了滥用安眠药的危险。

我不喜欢参加葬礼，但珍妮特恳求我这次一定要参加查理的葬礼。他生前所在医院的几个同事都意欲参加这个葬礼，但由于马热丽不同意，他们被劝阻了。参加葬礼的只有珍妮特、比尔、马热丽和我。我们要到太平间去接灵车。他们提议我就在家等着，他们上路后再打电话给我。我留意着车，当我看到车开过来时，就下了楼，但比尔下车后在我家门口堵住了我。

“稍候片刻，”他说，“我要跟你说点儿事。珍妮特要你在葬礼后到我家来吃茶点，她说让马热丽闷闷不乐地待着不好，我们可以一起打打桥牌。你能来吗？”

“就这些吗？”我问道。

我穿着燕尾服和晚礼服裤，系着一条黑领带。

“哦，就这些。这样可以让马热丽分分心。”

“好吧。”

但我们最后并没有打桥牌。一头美丽秀发的珍妮特相当聪明地展现了她的深切哀悼，她以高超的技巧扮演着一个富有同情心的朋友角色。她也流了一点儿泪，然后小心翼翼地擦了擦眼睛，以免碰到涂了睫毛膏的眼睫毛。当马热丽肝胆欲裂地哭泣的时候，珍妮特温柔地搂着她。当别人遇到麻烦的时候，她确实能帮帮忙。我们在葬礼后回到马什夫妇的家。这时有一封给马热丽的电报，她拿过电报上了楼。我以为这是查理的一位刚刚听说了他死讯的朋友发来的唁电。比尔去换衣服了，珍妮特和我来到客厅，我俩把桥牌桌抬了出来，她摘下帽子，并将它放到了钢琴上。

“虚伪过头没什么好处。”她说道，“虽说马热丽的情绪非常不稳，但她现在必须要振作起来，打打桥牌能让她恢复到正常的状态。当然了，我也为可怜的查理深感悲痛，但就查理而言，我想他从来就没有从马热丽离开他这件事中恢复过来。不可否认的是，现在对于马热丽来说，事情简单多了。今天早上她给格里打电话了。”

“说了些什么？”

“告诉他关于可怜的查理死了的事。”

这时女佣走进客厅。

“你能到楼上毕肖普夫人那儿去吗，太太？她想要见您。”

“当然，我这就去。”

她迅速离开了房间，我一个人被撂在了客厅。不久比尔走了过来，我俩喝了杯酒。最后，珍妮特回来了，她递给我一封电报。电报上写着：





看在上帝的面上等着信。

格里





“你认为这句话是什么意思？”她问我。

“就是这个意思嘛。”我回答道。

“愚蠢！我当然已经告诉了马热丽这句话没有别的意思，但她还是很担心。她肯定是通过电话告诉他查理已经死了。我想，她现在可能不会有心情打桥牌了。我的意思是说，在她丈夫刚举行完葬礼的当天就进行这种游戏不大合适。”

“确实，我同意。”我说道。

“当然他会发电报来。他肯定会这么做的，对不对？我们唯一能做的事情就是挺直了坐着，等他的信。”

我看再继续这场谈话已经没有任何意义了，于是我便告辞了。两天后，珍妮特打来电话，告诉我莫顿给马热丽发来了唁电。她将电报的内容逐字读给我听。





惊悉噩耗，不胜悲哀。望你节哀，多多保重。

爱你的

格里





“你怎么看这封电报？”她问我。

“内容很恰当啊。”

“他当然不能说自己高兴得要跳起来了，对不对？”

“要是那样的话就太不深沉了。”

“但他还是用上了‘爱你的’这三个字。”

我在头脑中想象着这两个女人怎样反复揣度着这两封电报，她们仔细琢磨每一个字的含义，从各种角度来进行分析。我几乎可以听见她俩无休无止的交谈声。

“如果他现在让马热丽感到失望，我不知道马热丽会出什么事。”珍妮特继续说道，“当然了，他是否是个绅士还有待观察。”

“别胡说了。”我说完这句话后就挂断了电话。

接下来的几天，我与马什夫妇一起吃过两次饭。马热丽看起来憔悴不堪，我猜她正在心急如焚地等着那封还在路上的信。悲痛和害怕的双重折磨让她骨瘦如柴，她现在看上去极度脆弱，不得不去看心理医生。之前她从未有过这样的举动。她变得非常和蔼，别人对她表示关心，她会非常感激，她的笑容里也没有了自信，甚至有点儿怯懦，带着无边的哀婉。她无助的样子非常惹人同情，但莫顿远在数千英里之外。一天早上，珍妮特又给我打来电话。

“信到了，马热丽说可以让你看这封信。你能马上过来一趟吗？”

她紧张的语气已经让我大致知道了信的内容。当我到达她家后，珍妮特立即把信递给了我。我读完了信。这封信的用词很谨慎，我猜莫顿写这封信时一定反复修改过。信的内容充满了抚慰，显然他为了避免说任何可能伤及马热丽的话煞费苦心，但信中还是流露出他心中的恐惧。显然他被这种情况吓得浑身发抖，显然他觉得应付这种局面的最好办法是用点儿玩世不恭的语言。他对那块殖民地上的白种人肆意取笑了一番。如果马热丽突然出现，他们会说些什么呢？他可能很快就会被炒鱿鱼。人们往往认为在东方的生活自由自在，非常轻松，但事实并非如此。这里的生活比克拉珀姆[6]还要紧张。他太爱马热丽了，以至于一想到那些可怕的女人对马热丽嗤之以鼻的情景，他就无法忍受。此外，他现在被派往一个驻地，那里离周围其他地方有十天的路程。她绝对无法在他住的小屋内生活下去，那里当然也没有旅馆。他得深入丛林中去工作，一去就是好几天。这里绝不是一个适于女人生活的地方。他告诉她，她对他有多么重要，但她没必要为他操心。他不禁想到，她要是能回到她丈夫身边就好了。如果他认为自己成了她跟她丈夫之间的障碍，他将永远也不会饶恕自己。是的，我完全相信，写这样一封信真是不易。

“他写这封信的时候当然不知道查理死了。我曾告诉马热丽，他这一死把一切都改变了。”

“她同意你的说法吗？”

“我想她现在有点儿失去了理智。你怎么看这封信？”

“哦，写得很明白，他不打算要她。”

“两个月前他可是拼死拼活地追求她呀。”

“此一时彼一时了。人的变化之快真是难料啊。对他而言，离开伦敦的这段时间感觉起来得有一年了。他又回到了老朋友之中，又开始了他过去感兴趣的事情。亲爱的，马热丽自欺欺人没有什么益处。他已经回到属于他自己的生活中了，那里没有她的份儿。”

“我已经建议她不要管这封信，直接找他去。”

“我倒希望她做个明白人，不要让自己断然遭拒。”

“那她怎么办呢？噢，这也太残酷了。她是这个世界上最好的女人，她真的是非常优秀。”

“你这样想就可笑了，正是她的优秀惹来了这些麻烦，她为什么要跟莫顿来场婚外情？查理本来可以不知道这件事，那样也就没有这些糟糕的后果了；她与莫顿本来可以度过一段快活的时光，然后当他离开时，他们应该意识到一段让人舒心的插曲也要有一个优美的终结，然后就这样分手。这段故事也能成为两人愉快的回忆；她本来可以心满意足地回到查理身边继续过安稳的生活，继续做她的贤妻。”

珍妮特噘起了嘴唇，她轻蔑地瞅了我一眼。

“但还有贞洁的问题要考虑呢，你懂吗？”

“让贞洁见鬼去吧，贞洁只能造成毁灭和不幸，简直一文不值。如果你愿意，你可以称这种行为为贞洁，我管它叫怯懦。”

“她不会在与查理一起生活的时候背叛他。虽然有些女人能干得出来，但她对这种念头感到厌恶。”

“天哪，她本来可以在肉体上对他不忠的同时选择在精神上对他保持忠诚。这种骗术对女人来说易如反掌。”

“你真是一个可恶的玩世不恭者。”

“如果客观地看问题和按常识处理生活中遇到的问题被称作玩世不恭，那我的的确确是一个玩世不恭者。如果你喜欢的话，也可以说我可恶。现在我们就来客观地分析分析。马热丽是一个中年妇女，查理也五十五岁了，他俩已经结婚十六年了，当一个小伙子对她百般殷勤的时候，她自然会昏了头，但不要把这称作爱情，这是一种生理学现象。她如果把他所说的任何一句话当真，那她就是一个傻瓜。说出这些甜言蜜语的不是他本人，而是他如饥似渴的性本能。他一直在忍受着性饥渴，在四年的时间里他没有碰过女人，至少是没有碰过白种女人。他当时是说了一些疯话，许了一些诺言，但她竟然当真了，这会毁了他，这太可怕了。他看中马热丽只是一个巧合，他想要她，因为得不到她而更想要她。我猜他把这当成了爱情。但我可以肯定地说，这只是淫欲。如果他俩真的上了床，查理现在就不会死，正是她该死的贞洁才引出了这一系列后果。”

“你怎么这么蠢呢？你没看出来她是身不由己？她只是不想成为一个放荡的女人。”

“比起自私的女人，我更喜欢放荡的女人，比起愚蠢的女人，我也更青睐水性杨花的女人。”

“噢！住嘴。我请你到这里来不是让你来胡说八道，说这些恶毒话的。”

“那你让我过来干什么？”

“格里是你的朋友，是你把他介绍给了马热丽。假使她陷入了困境，那也是他造成的，但你是这一切麻烦的根源，你有责任给他写信，告诉他，他必须对她负责任。”

“我要是这样做了那我才该死呢。”我回答道。

“那你最好就离开这里。”

我转身准备离开。

“好吧，无论如何，万幸的是查理买了个生命保险。”珍妮特说道。

听了这句话，我转过身来，对她说道：

“你还敢管我叫玩世不恭者？”

在这里我就不重复我甩给她的那些骂人话了。我一面谩骂，一面摔门而去。但珍妮特依然是那个非常不错的女人，我经常想，娶她做妻子一定非常有意思。

The Escape


I have always been convinced that if a woman once made up her mind to marry a man nothing but instant flight could save him. Not always that; for once a friend of mine, seeing the inevitable loom menacingly before him, took ship from a certain port (with a tooth brush for all his luggage, so conscious was he of his danger and the necessity for immediate action) and spent a year travelling round the world; but when, thinking himself safe (women are fickle, he said, and in twelve months she will have forgotten all about me), he landed at the selfsame port the first person he saw gaily waving to him from the quay was the little lady from whom he had fled. I have only once known a man who in such circumstances managed to extricate himself. His name was Roger Charing. He was no longer young when he fell in love with Ruth Barlow and he had had sufficient experience to make him careful; but Ruth Barlow had a gift (or should I call it a quality?) that renders most men defenceless, and it was this that dispossessed Roger of his commonsense, his prudence, and his worldly wisdom. He went down like a row of ninepins. This was the gift of pathos. Mrs. Barlow, for she was twice a widow, had splendid dark eyes and they were the most moving I ever saw; they seemed to be ever on the point of filling with tears; they suggested that the world was too much for her, and you felt that, poor dear, her sufferings had been more than anyone should be asked to bear. If, like Roger Charing, you were a strong, hefty fellow with plenty of money, it was almost inevitable that you should say to yourself: I must stand between the hazards of life and this helpless little thing, oh, how wonderful it would be to take the sadness out of those big and lovely eyes! I gathered from Roger that everyone had treated Mrs. Barlow very badly. She was apparently one of those unfortunate persons with whom nothing by any chance goes right. If she married a husband he beat her; if she employed a broker he cheated her; if she engaged a cook she drank. She never had a little lamb but it was sure to die.

When Roger told me that he had at last persuaded her to marry him, I wished him joy.

"I hope you'll be good friends," he said. "She's a little afraid of you, you know; she thinks you're callous."

"Upon my word I don't know why she should think that."

"You do like her, don't you?"

"Very much."

"She's had a rotten time, poor dear. I feel so dreadfully sorry for her."

"Yes," I said.

I couldn't say less. I knew she was stupid and I thought she was scheming. My own belief was that she was as hard as nails.

The first time I met her we had played bridge together and when she was my partner she twice trumped my best card. I behaved like an angel, but I confess that I thought if the tears were going to well up into anybody's eyes they should have been mine rather than hers. And when, having by the end of the evening lost a good deal of money to me, she said she would send me a cheque and never did, I could not but think that I and not she should have worn a pathetic expression when next we met.

Roger introduced her to his friends. He gave her lovely jewels. He took her here, there, and everywhere. Their marriage was announced for the immediate future. Roger was very happy. He was committing a good action and at the same time doing something he had very much a mind to. It is an uncommon situation and it is not surprising if he was a trifle more pleased with himself than was altogether becoming.

Then, on a sudden, he fell out of love. I do not know why. It could hardly have been that he grew tired of her conversation, for she had never had any conversation. Perhaps it was merely that this pathetic look of hers ceased to wring his heart-strings. His eyes were opened and he was once more the shrewd man of the world he had been. He became acutely conscious that Ruth Barlow had made up her mind to marry him and he swore a solemn oath that nothing would induce him to marry Ruth Barlow. But he was in a quandary. Now that he was in possession of his senses he saw with clearness the sort of woman he had to deal with and he was aware that, if he asked her to release him, she would (in her appealing way) assess her wounded feelings at an immoderately high figure. Besides, it is always awkward for a man to jilt a woman. People are apt to think he has behaved badly.

Roger kept his own counsel. He gave neither by word nor gesture an indication that his feelings towards Ruth Barlow had changed. He remained attentive to all her wishes; he took her to dine at restaurants, they went to the play together, he sent her flowers; he was sympathetic and charming. They had made up their minds that they would be married as soon as they found a house that suited them, for he lived in chambers and she in furnished rooms; and they set about looking at desirable residences. The agents sent Roger orders to view and he took Ruth to see a number of houses. It was very hard to find anything that was quite satisfactory. Roger applied to more agents. They visited house after house. They went over them thoroughly, examining them from the cellars in the basement to the attics under the roof. Sometimes they were too large and sometimes they were too small; sometimes they were too far from the centre of things and sometimes they were too close; sometimes they were too expensive and sometimes they wanted too many repairs; sometimes they were too stuffy and sometimes they were too airy; sometimes they were too dark and sometimes they were too bleak. Roger always found a fault that made the house unsuitable. Of course he was hard to please; he could not bear to ask his dear Ruth to live in any but the perfect house, and the perfect house wanted finding. House-hunting is a tiring and a tiresome business and presently Ruth began to grow peevish. Roger begged her to have patience; somewhere, surely, existed the very house they were looking for, and it only needed a little perseverance and they would find it. They looked at hundreds of houses; they climbed thousands of stairs; they inspected innumerable kitchens. Ruth was exhausted and more than once lost her temper.

"If you don't find a house soon," she said, "I shall have to reconsider my position. Why, if you go on like this we shan't be married for years."

"Don't say that," he answered, "I beseech you to have patience. I've just received some entirely new lists from agents I've only just heard of. There must be at least sixty houses on them."

They set out on the chase again. They looked at more houses and more houses. For two years they looked at houses. Ruth grew silent and scornful: her pathetic, beautiful eyes acquired an expression that was almost sullen. There are limits to human endurance. Mrs. Barlow had the patience of an angel, but at last she revolted.

"Do you want to marry me or do you not?" she asked him.

There was an unaccustomed hardness in her voice, but it did not affect the gentleness of his reply.

"Of course I do. We'll be married the very moment we find a house. By the way, I've just heard of something that might suit us."

"I don't feel well enough to look at any more houses just yet."

"Poor dear, I was afraid you were looking rather tired."

Ruth Barlow took to her bed. She would not see Roger and he had to content himself with calling at her lodgings to inquire and sending her flowers. He was as ever assiduous and gallant. Every day he wrote and told her that he had heard of another house for them to look at. A week passed and then he received the following letter:





Roger I do not think you really love me. I have found someone who is anxious to take care of me and I am going to be married to him today.

Ruth





He sent back his reply by special messenger:





Ruth

Your news shatters me. I shall never get over the blow, but of course your happiness must be my first consideration. I send you herewith seven orders to view; they arrived by this morning's post and I am quite sure you will find among them a house that will exactly suit you.

Roger





The Verger


There had been a christening that afternoon at St Peter's, Neville Square, and Albert Edward Foreman still wore his verger's gown. He kept his new one, its folds as full and stiff as though it were made not of alpaca but of perennial bronze, for funerals and weddings (St Peter's, Neville Square, was a church much favoured by the fashionable for these ceremonies) and now he wore only his second-best. He wore it with complacence, for it was the dignified symbol of his office, and without it (when he took it off to go home) he had the disconcerting sensation of being somewhat insufficiently clad. He took pains with it; he pressed it and ironed it himself. During the sixteen years he had been verger of this church he had had a succession of such gowns, but he had never been able to throw them away when they were worn out and the complete series, neatly wrapped up in brown paper, lay in the bottom drawers of the wardrobe in his bedroom.

The verger busied himself quietly, replacing the painted wooden cover on the marble font, taking away a chair that had been brought for an infirm old lady, and waited for the vicar to have finished in the vestry so that he could tidy up in there and go home. Presently he saw him walk across the chancel, genuflect in front of the high altar, and come down the aisle; but he still wore his cassock.

"What's he 'anging about for?" the verger said to himself. "Don't 'e know I want my tea?"

The vicar had been but recently appointed, a red-faced energetic man in the early forties, and Albert Edward still regretted his predecessor, a clergyman of the old school who preached leisurely sermons in a silvery voice and dined out a great deal with his more aristocratic parishioners. He liked things in church to be just so, but he never fussed; he was not like this new man who wanted to have his finger in every pie. But Albert Edward was tolerant. St Peter's was in a very good neighbourhood and the parishioners were a very nice class of people. The new vicar had come from the East End and he couldn't be expected to fall in all at once with the discreet ways of his fashionable congregation.

"All this 'ustle," said Albert Edward. "But give 'im time, he'll learn."

When the vicar had walked down the aisle so far that he could address the verger without raising his voice more than was becoming in a place of worship he stopped.

"Foreman, will you come into the vestry for a minute. I have something to say to you."

"Very good, sir."

The vicar waited for him to come up and they walked up the church together.

"A very nice christening, I thought, sir. Funny 'ow the baby stopped cryin' the moment you took him."

"I've noticed they very often do," said the vicar, with a little smile. "After all I've had a good deal of practice with them."

It was a source of subdued pride to him that he could nearly always quiet a whimpering infant by the manner in which he held it and he was not unconscious of the amused admiration with which mothers and nurses watched him settle the baby in the crook of his surpliced arm. The verger knew that it pleased him to be complimented on his talent.

The vicar preceded Albert Edward into the vestry. Albert Edward was a trifle surprised to find the two churchwardens there. He had not seen them come in. They gave him pleasant nods.

"Good afternoon, my lord. Good afternoon, sir," he said to one after the other.

They were elderly men, both of them, and they had been churchwardens almost as long as Albert Edward had been verger. They were sitting now at a handsome refectory table that the old vicar had brought many years before from Italy and the vicar sat down in the vacant chair between them. Albert Edward faced them, the table between him and them, and wondered with slight uneasiness what was the matter. He remembered still the occasion on which the organist had got into trouble and the bother they had all had to hush things up. In a church like St Peter's, Neville Square, they couldn't afford a scandal. On the vicar's red face was a look of resolute benignity, but the others bore an expression that was slightly troubled.

"He's been naggin' them, he 'as," said the verger to himself. "He's jockeyed them into doin' something, but they don't 'alf like it. That's what it is, you mark my words."

But his thoughts did not appear on Albert Edward's clean-cut and distinguished features. He stood in a respectful but not obsequious attitude. He had been in service before he was appointed to his ecclesiastical office, but only in very good houses, and his deportment was irreproachable. Starting as a page-boy in the household of a merchant-prince, he had risen by due degrees from the position of fourth to first footman, for a year he had been single-handed butler to a widowed peeress, and, till the vacancy occurred at St Peter's, butler with two men under him in the house of a retired ambassador. He was tall, spare, grave, and dignified. He looked, if not like a duke, at least like an actor of the old school who specialized in dukes' parts. He had tact, firmness, and self-assurance. His character was unimpeachable.

The vicar began briskly.

"Foreman, we've got something rather unpleasant to say to you. You've been here a great many years and I think his lordship and the general agree with me that you've fulfilled the duties of your office to the satisfaction of everybody concerned."

The two churchwardens nodded.

"But a most extraordinary circumstance came to my knowledge the other day and I felt it my duty to impart it to the churchwardens. I discovered to my astonishment that you could neither read nor write."

The verger's face betrayed no sign of embarrassment.

"The last vicar knew that, sir," he replied. "He said it didn't make no difference. He always said there was a great deal too much education in the world for 'is taste."

"It's the most amazing thing I ever heard," cried the general. "Do you mean to say that you've been verger of this church for sixteen years and never learned to read or write?"

"I went into service when I was twelve, sir. The cook in the first place tried to teach me once, but I didn't seem to 'ave the knack for it, and then what with one thing and another I never seemed to 'ave the time. I've never really found the want of it. I think a lot of these young fellows waste a rare lot of time readin' when they might be doin' something useful."

"But don't you want to know the news?" said the other churchwarden. "Don't you ever want to write a letter?"

"No, me lord, I seem to manage very well without. And of late years now they've all these pictures in the papers I get to know what's goin' on pretty well. Me wife's quite a scholar and if I want to write a letter she writes it for me. It's not as if I was a bettin' man."

The two churchwardens gave the vicar a troubled glance and then looked down at the table.

"Well, Foreman, I've talked the matter over with these gentlemen and they quite agree with me that the situation is impossible. At a church like St Peter's, Neville Square, we cannot have a verger who can neither read nor write."

Albert Edward's thin, sallow face reddened and he moved uneasily on his feet, but he made no reply.

"Understand me, Foreman, I have no complaint to make against you. You do your work quite satisfactorily; I have the highest opinion both of your character and of your capacity; but we haven't the right to take the risk of some accident that might happen owing to your lamentable ignorance. It's a matter of prudence as well as of principle."

"But couldn't you learn, Foreman?" asked the general.

"No, sir, I'm afraid I couldn't, not now. You see, I'm not as young as I was and if I couldn't seem able to get the letters in me 'ead when I was a nipper I don't think there's much chance of it now."

"We don't want to be harsh with you, Foreman," said the vicar. "But the churchwardens and I have quite made up our minds. We'll give you three months and if at the end of that time you cannot read and write I'm afraid you'll have to go."

Albert Edward had never liked the new vicar. He'd said from the beginning that they'd made a mistake when they gave him St Peter's. He wasn't the type of man they wanted with a classy congregation like that. And now he straightened himself a little. He knew his value and he wasn't going to allow himself to be put upon.

"I'm very sorry, sir, I'm afraid it's no good. I'm too old a dog to learn new tricks. I've lived a good many years without knowin' 'ow to read and write, and without wishin' to praise myself, self-praise is no recommendation, I don't mind sayin' I've done my duty in that state of life in which it 'as pleased a merciful providence to place me, and if I could learn now I don't know as I'd want to."

"In that case, Foreman, I'm afraid you must go."

"Yes, sir, I quite understand. I shall be 'appy to 'and in my resignation as soon as you've found somebody to take my place."

But when Albert Edward with his usual politeness had closed the church door behind the vicar and the two churchwardens he could not sustain the air of unruffled dignity with which he had borne the blow inflicted upon him and his lips quivered. He walked slowly back to the vestry and hung up on its proper peg his verger's gown. He sighed as he thought of all the grand funerals and smart weddings it had seen. He tidied everything up, put on his coat, and hat in hand walked down the aisle. He locked the church door behind him. He strolled across the square, but deep in his sad thoughts he did not take the street that led him home, where a nice strong cup of tea awaited him; he took the wrong turning. He walked slowly along. His heart was heavy. He did not know what he should do with himself. He did not fancy the notion of going back to domestic service; after being his own master for so many years, for the vicar and churchwardens could say what they liked, it was he that had run St Peter's, Neville Square, he could scarcely demean himself by accepting a situation. He had saved a tidy sum, but not enough to live on without doing something, and life seemed to cost more every year. He had never thought to be troubled with such questions. The vergers of St Peter's, like the popes of Rome, were there for life. He had often thought of the pleasant reference the vicar would make in his sermon at evensong the first Sunday after his death to the long and faithful service, and the exemplary character of their late verger, Albert Edward Foreman. He sighed deeply. Albert Edward was a non-smoker and a total abstainer, but with a certain latitude; that is to say he liked a glass of beer with his dinner and when he was tired he enjoyed a cigarette. It occurred to him now that one would comfort him and since he did not carry them he looked about him for a shop where he could buy a packet of Gold Flake. He did not at once see one and walked on a little. It was a long street, with all sorts of shops in it, but there was not a single one where you could buy cigarettes.

"That's strange," said Albert Edward.

To make sure he walked right up the street again. No, there was no doubt about it. He stopped and looked reflectively up and down.

"I can't be the only man as walks along this street and wants a fag," he said. "I shouldn't wonder but what a fellow might do very well with a little shop here. Tobacco and sweets, you know."

He gave a sudden start.

"That's an idea," he said. "Strange 'ow things come to you when you least expect it."

He turned, walked home, and had his tea.

"You're very silent this afternoon, Albert," his wife remarked.

"I'm thinkin'," he said.

He considered the matter from every point of view and next day he went along the street and by good luck found a little shop to let that looked as though it would exactly suit him. Twenty-four hours later he had taken it, and when a month after that he left St Peter's, Neville Square, for ever, Albert Edward Foreman set up in business as a tobacconist and newsagent. His wife said it was a dreadful come-down after being verger of St Peter's, but he answered that you had to move with the times, the church wasn't what it was, and 'enceforward he was going to render unto Caesar what was Caesar's. Albert Edward did very well. He did so well that in a year or so it struck him that he might take a second shop and put a manager in. He looked for another long street that hadn't got a tobacconist in it and when he found it, and a shop to let, took it and stocked it. This was a success too. Then it occurred to him that if he could run two he could run half a dozen, so he began walking about London, and whenever he found a long street that had no tobacconist and a shop to let he took it. In the course of ten years he had acquired no less than ten shops and he was making money hand over fist. He went round to all of them himself every Monday, collected the week's takings, and took them to the bank.

One morning when he was there paying in a bundle of notes and a heavy bag of silver the cashier told him that the manager would like to see him. He was shown into an office and the manager shook hands with him.

"Mr. Foreman, I wanted to have a talk to you about the money you've got on deposit with us. d'you know exactly how much it is?"

"Not within a pound or two, sir; but I've got a pretty rough idea."

"Apart from what you paid in this morning it's a little over thirty thousand pounds. That's a very large sum to have on deposit and I should have thought you'd do better to invest it."

"I wouldn't want to take no risk, sir. I know it's safe in the bank."

"You needn't have the least anxiety. We'll make you out a list of absolutely gilt-edged securities. They'll bring you in a better rate of interest than we can possibly afford to give you."

A troubled look settled on Mr. Foreman's distinguished face. "I've never 'ad anything to do with stocks and shares and I'd 'ave to leave it all in your 'ands," he said.

The manager smiled. "We'll do everything. All you'll have to do next time you come in is just to sign the transfers."

"I could do that all right," said Albert uncertainly. "But 'ow should I know what I was signin'?"

"I suppose you can read," said the manager a trifle sharply.

Mr. Foreman gave him a disarming smile.

"Well, sir, that's just it. I can't. I know it sounds funny-like, but there it is, I can't read or write, only me name, an' I only learnt to do that when I went into business."

The manager was so surprised that he jumped up from his chair.

"That's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard."

"You see, it's like this, sir, I never 'ad the opportunity until it was too late and then some'ow I wouldn't. I got obstinate-like."

The manager stared at him as though he were a prehistoric monster.

"And do you mean to say that you've built up this important business and amassed a fortune of thirty thousand pounds without being able to read or write? Good God, man, what would you be now if you had been able to?"

"I can tell you that, sir," said Mr. Foreman, a little smile on his still aristocratic features. "I'd be verger of St Peter's, Neville Square."





The Facts of Life


It was Henry Garnet's habit on leaving the city of an afternoon to drop in at his club and play bridge before going home to dinner. He was a pleasant man to play with. He knew the game well and you could be sure that he would make the best of his cards. He was a good loser; and when he won he was more inclined to ascribe his success to his luck than to his skill. He was indulgent, and if his partner made a mistake he could be trusted to find an excuse for him. It was surprising then on this occasion to hear him telling his partner with unnecessary sharpness that he had never seen a hand worse played; and it was more surprising still to see him not only make a grave error himself, an error of which you would never have thought him capable, but when his partner, not unwilling to get a little of his own back, pointed it out, insist against all reason and with considerable heat that he was perfectly right. But they were all old friends, the men he was playing with, and none of them took his ill-humour very seriously. Henry Garnet was a broker, a partner in a firm of repute, and it occurred to one of them that something had gone wrong with some stock he was interested in.

"How's the market today?" he asked.

"Booming. Even the suckers are making money."

It was evident that stocks and shares had nothing to do with Henry Garnet's vexation; but something was the matter; that was evident too. He was a hearty fellow, who enjoyed excellent health; he had plenty of money; he was fond of his wife, and devoted to his children. As a rule he had high spirits, and he laughed easily at the nonsense they were apt to talk while they played; but today he sat glum and silent. His brows were crossly puckered and there was a sulky look about his mouth. Presently, to ease the tension, one of the others mentioned a subject upon which they all knew Henry Garnet was glad to speak.

"How's your boy, Henry? I see he's done pretty well in the tournament."

Henry Garnet's frown grew darker.

"He's done no better than I expected him to."

"When does he come back from Monte?"

"He got back last night."

"Did he enjoy himself?"

"I suppose so; all I know is that he made a damned fool of himself."

"Oh. How?"

"I'd rather not talk about it if you don't mind."

The three men looked at him with curiosity. Henry Garnet scowled at the green baize.

"Sorry, old boy. You call."

The game proceeded in a strained silence. Garnet got his bid, and when he played his cards so badly that he went three down not a word was said. Another rubber was begun and in the second game Garnet denied a suit.

"Having none?" his partner asked him.

Garnet's irritability was such that he did not even reply, and when at the end of the hand it appeared that he had revoked, and that his revoke cost the rubber, it was not to be expected that his partner should let his carelessness go without remark.

"What's the devil's the matter with you, Henry?" he said. "You're playing like a fool."

Garnet was disconcerted. He did not so much mind losing a big rubber himself, but he was sore that his inattention should have made his partner lose too. He pulled himself together.

"I'd better not play any more. I thought a few rubbers would calm me, but the fact is I can't give my mind to the game. To tell you the truth I'm in a hell of a temper."

They all burst out laughing.

"You don't have to tell us that, old boy. It's obvious."

Garnet gave them a rueful smile.

"Well, I bet you'd be in a temper if what's happened to me had happened to you. As a matter of fact I'm in a damned awkward situation, and if any of you fellows can give me any advice how to deal with it I'd be grateful."

"Let's have a drink and you tell us all about it. With a K.C., a Home Office official and an eminent surgeon—if we can't tell you how to deal with a situation, nobody can."

The K.C. got up and rang the bell for a waiter.

"It's about that damned boy of mine," said Henry Garnet.

Drinks were ordered and brought. And this is the story that Henry Garnet told them.

The boy of whom he spoke was his only son. His name was Nicholas and of course he was called Nicky. He was eighteen. The Garnets had two daughters besides, one of sixteen and the other of twelve, but however unreasonable it seemed, for a father is generally supposed to like his daughters best, and though he did all he could not to show his preference, there was no doubt that the greater share of Henry Garnet's affection was given to his son. He was kind, in a chaffing, casual way, to his daughters, and gave them handsome presents on their birthdays and at Christmas; but he doted on Nicky. Nothing was too good for him. He thought the world of him. He could hardly take his eyes off him. You could not blame him, for Nicky was a son that any parent might have been proud of. He was six foot two, lithe but muscular, with broad shoulders and a slim waist, and he held himself gallantly erect; he had a charming head, well placed on the shoulders, with pale brown hair that waved slightly, blue eyes with long dark lashes under well-marked eyebrows, a full red mouth, and a tanned, clean skin. When he smiled he showed very regular and very white teeth. He was not shy, but there was a modesty in his demeanour that was attractive. In social intercourse he was easy, polite, and quietly gay. He was the offspring of nice, healthy, decent parents, he had been well brought up in a good home, he had been sent to a good school, and the general result was as engaging a specimen of young manhood as you were likely to find in a long time. You felt that he was as honest, open, and virtuous as he looked. He had never given his parents a moment's uneasiness. As a child he was seldom ill and never naughty. As a boy he did everything that was expected of him. His school reports were excellent. He was wonderfully popular, and he ended his career, with a creditable number of prizes, as head of the school and captain of the football team. But this was not all. At the age of fourteen Nicky had developed an unexpected gift for lawn tennis. This was a game that his father not only was fond of, but played very well, and when he discerned in the boy the promise of a tennis-player he fostered it. During the holidays he had him taught by the best professionals and by the time he was sixteen he had won a number of tournaments for boys of his age. He could beat his father so badly that only parental affection reconciled the older player to the poor show he put up. At eighteen Nicky went to Cambridge and Henry Garnet conceived the ambition that before he was through with the university he should play for it. Nicky had all the qualifications for becoming a great tennis-player. He was tall, he had a long reach, he was quick on his feet, and his timing was perfect. He realized instinctively where the ball was coming and, seemingly without hurry, was there to take it. He had a powerful serve, with a nasty break that made it difficult to return, and his forehand drive, low, long, and accurate, was deadly. He was not so good on the backhand and his volleying was wild, but all through the summer before he went to Cambridge Henry Garnet made him work on these points under the best teacher in England. At the back of his mind, though he did not even mention it to Nicky, he cherished a further ambition, to see his son play at Wimbledon, and who could tell, perhaps be chosen to represent his country in the Davis Cup. A great lump came into Henry Garnet's throat as he saw in fancy his son leap over the net to shake hands with the American champion whom he had just defeated, and walk off the court to the deafening plaudits of the multitude.

As an assiduous frequenter of Wimbledon Henry Garnet had a good many friends in the tennis world, and one evening he found himself at a City dinner sitting next to one of them, a Colonel Brabazon, and in due course began talking to him of Nicky and what chance there might be of his being chosen to play for his university during the following season.

"Why don't you let him go down to Monte Carlo and play in the spring tournament there?" said the Colonel suddenly.

"Oh, I don't think he's good enough for that. He's not nineteen yet, he only went up to Cambridge last October; he wouldn't stand a chance against all those cracks."

"Of course, Austin and von Cramm and so on would knock spots off him, but he might snatch a game or two; and if he got up against some of the smaller fry there's no reason why he shouldn't win two or three matches. He's never been up against any of the first-rate players and it would be wonderful practice for him. He'd learn a lot more than he'll ever learn in the seaside tournaments you enter him for."

"I wouldn't dream of it. I'm not going to let him leave Cambridge in the middle of a term. I've always impressed upon him that tennis is only a game and it mustn't interfere with work."

Colonel Brabazon asked Garnet when the term ended.

"That's all right. He'd only have to cut about three days. Surely that could be arranged. You see, two of the men we were depending on have let us down, and we're in a hole. We want to send as good a team as we can. The Germans are sending their best players and so are the Americans."

"Nothing doing, old boy. In the first place Nicky's not good enough, and secondly, I don't fancy the idea of sending a kid like that to Monte Carlo without anyone to look after him. If I could get away myself I might think of it, but that's out of the question."

"I shall be there. I'm going as the non-playing captain of the English team. I'll keep an eye on him."

"You'll be busy, and besides, it's not a responsibility I'd like to ask you to take. He's never been abroad in his life, and to tell you the truth, I shouldn't have a moment's peace all the time he was there."

They left it at that and presently Henry Garnet went home. He was so flattered by Colonel Brabazon's suggestion that he could not help telling his wife.

"Fancy his thinking Nicky's as good as that. He told me he'd seen him play and his style was fine. He only wants more practice to get into the first flight. We shall see the kid playing in the semi-finals at Wimbledon yet, old girl."

To his surprise Mrs. Garnet was not so much opposed to the notion as he would have expected.

"After all the boy's eighteen. Nicky's never got into mischief yet and there's no reason to suppose he will now."

"There's his work to be considered; don't forget that. I think it would be a very bad precedent to let him cut the end of term."

"But what can three days matter? It seems a shame to rob him of a chance like that. I'm sure he'd jump at it if you asked him."

"Well, I'm not going to. I haven't sent him to Cambridge just to play tennis. I know he's steady, but it's silly to put temptation in his way. He's much too young to go to Monte Carlo by himself."

"You say he won't have a chance against these crack players, but you can't tell."

Henry Garnet sighed a little. On the way home in the car it had struck him that Austin's health was uncertain and that von Cramm had his off-days. Supposing, just for the sake of argument, that Nicky had a bit of luck like that—then there would be no doubt that he would be chosen to play for Cambridge. But of course that was all nonsense.

"Nothing doing, my dear. I've made up my mind and I'm not going to change it."

Mrs. Garnet held her peace. But next day she wrote to Nicky, telling him what had happened, and suggested to him what she would do in his place if, wanting to go, he wished to get his father's consent. A day or two later Henry Garnet received a letter from his son. He was bubbling over with excitement. He had seen his tutor, who was a tennis-player himself, and the Provost of his college, who happened to know Colonel Brabazon, and no objection would be made to his leaving before the end of term; they both thought it an opportunity that shouldn't be missed. He didn't see what harm he could come to, and if only, just this once, his father would stretch a point, well, next term, he promised faithfully, he'd work like blazes. It was a very pretty letter. Mrs. Garnet watched her husband read it at the breakfast table; she was undisturbed by the frown on his face. He threw it over to her.

"I don't know why you thought it necessary to tell Nicky something I told you in confidence. It's too bad of you. Now you've thoroughly unsettled him."

"I'm sorry. I thought it would please him to know that Colonel Brabazon had such a high opinion of him. I don't see why one should only tell people the disagreeable things that are said about them. Of course I made it quite clear that there could be no question of his going."

"You've put me in an odious position. If there's anything I hate it's for the boy to look upon me as a spoil-sport and a tyrant."

"Oh, he'll never do that. He may think you rather silly and unreasonable, but I'm sure he'll understand that it's only for his own good that you're being so unkind."

"Christ," said Henry Garnet.

His wife had a great inclination to laugh. She knew the battle was won. Dear, oh dear, how easy it was to get men to do what you wanted. For appearance sake Henry Garnet held out for forty-eight hours, but then he yielded, and a fortnight later Nicky came to London. He was to start for Monte Carlo next morning, and after dinner, when Mrs. Garnet and her elder daughter had left them, Henry took the opportunity to give his son some good advice.

"I don't feel quite comfortable about letting you go off to a place like Monte Carlo at your age practically by yourself," he finished, "but there it is and I can only hope you'll be sensible. I don't want to play the heavy father, but there are three things especially that I want to warn you against: one is gambling, don't gamble; the second is money, don't lend anyone money; and the third is women, don't have anything to do with women. If you don't do any of those three things you can't come to much harm, so remember them well."

"All right, father," Nicky smiled.

"That's my last word to you. I know the world pretty well and believe me, my advice is sound."

"I won't forget it. I promise you."

"That's a good chap. Now let's go up and join the ladies."

Nicky beat neither Austin nor von Cramm in the Monte Carlo tournament, but he did not disgrace himself. He snatched an unexpected victory over a Spanish player and gave one of the Austrians a closer match than anyone had thought possible. In the mixed doubles he got into the semi-finals. His charm conquered everyone and he vastly enjoyed himself. It was generally allowed that he showed promise, and Colonel Brabazon told him that when he was a little older and had had more practice with first-class players he would be a credit to his father. The tournament came to an end and the day following he was to fly back to London. Anxious to play his best he had lived very carefully, smoking little and drinking nothing, and going to bed early; but on his last evening he thought he would like to see something of the life in Monte Carlo of which he had heard so much. An official dinner was given to the tennis-players and after dinner with the rest of them he went into the Sporting Club. It was the first time he had been there. Monte Carlo was very full and the rooms were crowded. Nicky had never before seen roulette played except in the pictures; in a maze he stopped at the first table he came to; chips of different sizes were scattered over the green cloth in what looked like a hopeless muddle; the croupier gave the wheel a sharp turn and with a flick threw in the little white ball. After what seemed an endless time the ball stopped and another croupier with a broad, indifferent gesture raked in the chips of those who had lost.

Presently Nicky wandered over to where they were playing trente et quarante, but he couldn't understand what it was all about and he thought it dull. He saw a crowd in another room and sauntered in. A big game of baccarat was in progress and he was immediately conscious of the tension. The players were protected from the thronging bystanders by a brass rail; they sat round the table, nine on each side, with the dealer in the middle and the croupier facing him. Big money was changing hands. The dealer was a member of the Greek Syndicate. Nicky looked at his impassive face. His eyes were watchful, but his expression never changed whether he won or lost. It was a terrifying, strangely impressive sight. It gave Nicky, who had been thriftily brought up, a peculiar thrill to see someone risk a thousand pounds on the turn of a card and when he lost make a little joke and laugh. It was all terribly exciting. An acquaintance came up to him.

"Been doing any good?" he asked.

"I haven't been playing."

"Wise of you. Rotten game. Come and have a drink."

"All right."

While they were having it Nicky told his friends that this was the first time he had ever been in the rooms.

"Oh, but you must have one little flutter before you go. It's idiotic to leave Monte without having tried your luck. After all it won't hurt you to lose a hundred francs or so."

"I don't suppose it will, but my father wasn't any too keen on my coming at all and one of the three things he particularly advised me not to do was to gamble."

But when Nicky left his companion he strolled back to one of the tables where they were playing roulette. He stood for a while looking at the losers' money being raked-in by the croupier and the money that was won paid out to the winners. It was impossible to deny that it was thrilling. His friend was right, it did seem silly to leave Monte without putting something on the table just once. It would be an experience, and at his age you had to have all the experience you could get. He reflected that he hadn't promised his father not to gamble, he'd promised him not to forget his advice. It wasn't quite the same, was it? He took a hundred-franc note out of his pocket and rather shyly put it on number eighteen. He chose it because that was his age. With a wildly beating heart he watched the wheel turn; the little white ball whizzed about like a small demon of mischief; the wheel went round more slowly, the little white ball hesitated, it seemed about to stop, it went on again; Nicky could hardly believe his eyes when it fell into number eighteen. A lot of chips were passed over to him and his hands trembled as he took them. It seemed to amount to a lot of money. He was so confused that he never thought of putting anything on the following round; in fact he had no intention of playing any more, once was enough; and he was surprised when eighteen again came up. There was only one chip on it.

"By George, you've won again," said a man who was standing near to him.

"Me? I hadn't got anything on."

"Yes, you had. Your original stake. They always leave it on unless you ask for it back. Didn't you know?"

Another packet of chips was handed over to him. Nicky's head reeled. He counted his gains: seven thousand francs. A queer sense of power seized him; he felt wonderfully clever. This was the easiest way of making money that he had ever heard of. His frank, charming face was wreathed in smiles. His bright eyes met those of a woman standing by his side. She smiled.

"You're in luck," she said.

She spoke English, but with a foreign accent.

"I can hardly believe it. It's the first time I've ever played."

"That explains it. Lend me a thousand francs, will you? I've lost everything I've got. I'll give it you back in half an hour."

"All right."

She took a large red chip from his pile and with a word of thanks disappeared. The man who had spoken to him before grunted.

"You'll never see that again."

Nicky was dashed. His father had particularly advised him not to lend anyone money. What a silly thing to do! And to somebody he'd never seen in his life. But the fact was, he felt at that moment such a love for the human race that it had never occurred to him to refuse. And that big red chip, it was almost impossible to realize that it had any value. Oh well, it didn't matter, he still had six thousand francs, he'd just try his luck once or twice more and if he didn't win he'd go home. He put a chip on sixteen, which was his elder sister's age, but it didn't come up; then on twelve, which was his younger sister's, and that didn't come up either; he tried various numbers at random, but without success. It was funny, he seemed to have lost his knack. He thought he would try just once more and then stop; he won. He had made up all his losses and had something over. At the end of an hour, after various ups and downs, having experienced such thrills as he had never known in his life, he found himself with so many chips that they would hardly go in his pockets. He decided to go. He went to the changers' office and he gasped when twenty thousand-franc notes were spread out before him. He had never had so much money in his life. He put it in his pocket and was turning away when the woman to whom he had lent the thousand francs came up to him.

"I've been looking for you everywhere," she said. "I was afraid you'd gone. I was in a fever, I didn't know what you'd think of me. Here's your thousand francs and thank you so much for the loan."

Nicky, blushing scarlet, stared at her with amazement. How he had misjudged her! His father had said, don't gamble; well, he had, and he'd made twenty thousand francs; and his father had said, don't lend anyone money; well, he had, he'd lent quite a lot to a total stranger, and she'd returned it. The fact was that he wasn't nearly such a fool as his father thought: he'd had an instinct that he could lend her money with safety, and you see, his instinct was right. But he was so obviously taken aback that the little lady was forced to laugh.

"What is the matter with you?" she asked.

"To tell you the truth I never expected to see the money back."

"What did you take me for? Did you think I was a cocotte?"

Nicky reddened to the roots of his wavy hair.

"No, of course not."

"Do I look like one?"

"Not a bit."

She was dressed very quietly, in black, with a string of gold beads round her neck; her simple frock showed off a neat, slight figure; she had a pretty little face and a trim head. She was made up, but not excessively, and Nicky supposed that she was not more than three or four years older than himself. She gave him a friendly smile.

"My husband is in the administration in Morocco, and I've come to Monte Carlo for a few weeks because he thought I wanted a change."

"I was just going," said Nicky because he couldn't think of anything else to say.

"Already!"

"Well, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I'm going back to London by air."

"Of course. The tournament ended today, didn't it? I saw you play, you know, two or three times."

"Did you? I don't know why you should have noticed me."

"You've got a beautiful style. And you looked very sweet in your shorts."

Nicky was not an immodest youth, but it did cross his mind that perhaps she had borrowed that thousand francs in order to scrape acquaintance with him.

"Do you ever go to the Knickerbocker?" she asked.

"No. I never have."

"Oh, but you mustn't leave Monte Carlo without having been there. Why don't you come and dance a little? To tell you the truth, I'm starving with hunger and I should adore some bacon and eggs."

Nicky remembered his father's advice, not to have anything to do with women, but this was different; you had only to look at the pretty little thing to know at once that she was perfectly respectable. Her husband was in what corresponded, he supposed, to the Civil Service. His father and mother had friends who were Civil Servants and they and their wives sometimes came to dinner. It was true that the wives were neither so young nor so pretty as this one, but she was just as ladylike as they were. And after winning twenty thousand francs he thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to have a little fun.

"I'd love to go with you," he said. "But you won't mind if I don't stay very long. I've left instructions at my hotel that I'm to be called at seven."

"We'll leave as soon as ever you like."

Nicky found it very pleasant at the Knickerbocker. He ate his bacon and eggs with appetite. They shared a bottle of champagne. They danced, and the little lady told him he danced beautifully. He knew he danced pretty well, and of course she was easy to dance with. As light as a feather. She laid her cheek against his and when their eyes met there was in hers a smile that made his heart go pit-a-pat. A coloured woman sang in a throaty, sensual voice. The floor was crowded.

"Have you ever been told that you're very good-looking?" she asked.

"I don't think so," he laughed. "Gosh," he thought, "I believe she's fallen for me."

Nicky was not such a fool as to be unaware that women often liked him, and when she made that remark he pressed her to him a little more closely. She closed her eyes and a faint sigh escaped her lips.

"I suppose it wouldn't be quite nice if I kissed you before all these people," he said.

"What do you think they would take me for?"

It began to grow late and Nicky said that really he thought he ought to be going.

"I shall go too," she said. "Will you drop me at my hotel on your way?"

Nicky paid the bill. He was rather surprised at its amount, but with all that money he had in his pocket he could afford not to care, and they got into a taxi. She snuggled up to him and he kissed her. She seemed to like it.

"By Jove," he thought, "I wonder if there's anything doing."

It was true that she was a married woman, but her husband was in Morocco, and it certainly did look as if she'd fallen for him. Good and proper. It was true also that his father had warned him to have nothing to do with women, but, he reflected again, he hadn't actually promised he wouldn't, he'd only promised not to forget his advice. Well, he hadn't; he was bearing it in mind that very minute. But circumstances alter cases. She was a sweet little thing; it seemed silly to miss the chance of an adventure when it was handed to you like that on a tray. When they reached the hotel he paid off the taxi.

"I'll walk home," he said. "The air will do me good after the stuffy atmosphere of that place."

"Come up a moment," she said. "I'd like to show you the photo of my little boy."

"Oh, have you got a little boy?" he exclaimed, a trifle dashed.

"Yes, a sweet little boy."

He walked upstairs after her. He didn't in the least want to see the photograph of her little boy, but he thought it only civil to pretend he did. He was afraid he'd made a fool of himself; it occurred to him that she was taking him up to look at the photograph in order to show him in a nice way that he'd made a mistake. He'd told her he was eighteen.

"I suppose she thinks I'm just a kid."

He began to wish he hadn't spent all that money on champagne at the nightclub.

But she didn't show him the photograph of her little boy after all. They had no sooner got into her room than she turned to him, flung her arms round his neck, and kissed him full on the lips. He had never in all his life been kissed so passionately.

"Darling," she said.

For a brief moment his father's advice once more crossed Nicky's mind and then he forgot it.





Nicky was a light sleeper and the least sound was apt to wake him. Two or three hours later he awoke and for a moment could not imagine where he was. The room was not quite dark, for the door of the bathroom was ajar, and the light in it had been left on. Suddenly he was conscious that someone was moving about the room. Then he remembered. He saw that it was his little friend, and he was on the point of speaking when something in the way she was behaving stopped him. She was walking very cautiously, as though she were afraid of waking him; she stopped once or twice and looked over at the bed. He wondered what she was after. He soon saw. She went over to the chair on which he had placed his clothes and once more looked in his direction. She waited for what seemed to him an interminable time. The silence was so intense that Nicky thought he could hear his own heart beating. Then, very slowly, very quietly, she took up his coat, slipped her hand into the inside pocket and drew out all those beautiful thousand-franc notes that Nicky had been so proud to win. She put the coat back and placed some other clothes on it so that it should look as though it had not been disturbed, then, with the bundle of notes in her hand, for an appreciable time stood once more stock-still. Nicky had repressed an instinctive impulse to jump up and grab her, it was partly surprise that had kept him quiet, partly the notion that he was in a strange hotel, in a foreign country, and if he made a row he didn't know what might happen. She looked at him. His eyes were partly closed and he was sure that she thought he was asleep. In the silence she could hardly fail to hear his regular breathing. When she had reassured herself that her movements had not disturbed him she stepped, with infinite caution, across the room. On a small table in the window a cineraria was growing in a pot. Nicky watched her now with his eyes wide open. The plant was evidently placed quite loosely in the pot, for taking it by the stalks she lifted it out; she put the banknotes in the bottom of the pot and replaced the plant. It was an excellent hiding-place. No one could have guessed that anything was concealed under that richly-flowering plant. She pressed the earth down with her fingers and then, very slowly, taking care not to make the smallest noise, crept across the room and slipped back into bed.

"Chéri," she said, in a caressing voice.

Nicky breathed steadily, like a man immersed in deep sleep. The little lady turned over on her side and disposed herself to slumber. But though Nicky lay so still his thoughts worked busily. He was extremely indignant at the scene he had just witnessed, and to himself he spoke his thoughts with vigour.

"She's nothing but a damned tart. She and her dear little boy and her husband in Morocco. My eye! She's a rotten thief, that's what she is. Took me for a mug. If she thinks she's going to get away with anything like that, she's mistaken."

He had already made up his mind what he was going to do with the money he had so cleverly won. He had long wanted a car of his own, and had thought it rather mean of his father not to have given him one. After all, a feller doesn't always want to drive about in the family bus. Well, he'd just teach the old man a lesson and buy one himself. For twenty thousand francs, two hundred pounds roughly, he could get a very decent second-hand car. He meant to get the money back, but just then he didn't quite know how. He didn't like the idea of kicking up a row, he was a stranger, in a hotel he knew nothing of; it might very well be that the beastly woman had friends there, he didn't mind facing anyone in a fair fight, but he'd look pretty foolish if someone pulled a gun on him. He reflected besides, very sensibly, that he had no proof the money was his. If it came to a showdown and she swore it was hers, he might very easily find himself hauled off to a police-station. He really didn't know what to do. Presently by her regular breathing he knew that the little lady was asleep. She must have fallen asleep with an easy mind, for she had done her job without a hitch. It infuriated Nicky that she should rest so peacefully while he lay awake worried to death. Suddenly an idea occurred to him. It was such a good one that it was only by the exercise of all his self-control that he prevented himself from jumping out of bed and carrying it out at once. Two could play at her game. She'd stolen his money; well, he'd steal it back again, and they'd be all square. He made up his mind to wait quite quietly until he was sure that deceitful woman was sound asleep. He waited for what seemed to him a very long time. She did not stir. Her breathing was as regular as a child's.

"Darling," he said at last.

No answer. No movement. She was dead to the world. Very slowly, pausing after every movement, very silently, he slipped out of bed. He stood still for a while, looking at her to see whether he had disturbed her. Her breathing was as regular as before. During the time he was waiting he had taken note carefully of the furniture in the room so that in crossing it he should not knock against a chair or a table and make a noise. He took a couple of steps and waited, he took a couple of steps more; he was very light on his feet and made no sound as he walked; he took fully five minutes to get to the window, and here he waited again. He started, for the bed slightly creaked, but it was only because the sleeper turned in her sleep. He forced himself to wait till he had counted one hundred. She was sleeping like a log. With infinite care he seized the cineraria by the stalks and gently pulled it out of the pot; he put his other hand in, his heart beat nineteen to the dozen as his fingers touched the notes, his hand closed on them and he slowly drew them out. He replaced the plant and in turn carefully pressed down the earth. While he was doing all this he had kept one eye on the form lying in the bed. It remained still. After another pause he crept softly to the chair on which his clothes were lying. He first put the bundle of notes in his coat pocket and then proceeded to dress. It took him a good quarter of an hour, because he could afford to make no sound. He had been wearing a soft shirt with his dinner jacket, and he congratulated himself on this, because it was easier to put on silently than a stiff one. He had some difficulty in tying his tie without a looking-glass, but he very wisely reflected that it didn't really matter if it wasn't tied very well. His spirits were rising. The whole thing now began to seem rather a lark. At length he was completely dressed except for his shoes, which he took in his hand; he thought he would put them on when he got into the passage. Now he had to cross the room to get to the door. He reached it so quietly that he could not have disturbed the lightest sleeper. But the door had to be unlocked. He turned the key very slowly; it creaked.

"Who's that?"

The little woman suddenly sat up in bed. Nicky's heart jumped to his mouth. He made a great effort to keep his head.

"It's only me. It's six o'clock and I've got to go. I was trying not to wake you."

"Oh, I forgot."

She sank back on to the pillow.

"Now that you're awake I'll put on my shoes."

He sat down on the edge of the bed and did this.

"Don't make a noise when you go out. The hotel people don't like it. Oh, I'm so sleepy."

"You go right off to sleep again."

"Kiss me before you go." He bent down and kissed her. "You're a sweet boy and a wonderful lover. Bon voyage."

Nicky did not feel quite safe till he got out of the hotel. The dawn had broken. The sky was unclouded, and in the harbour the yachts and the fishing-boats lay motionless on the still water. On the quay fishermen were getting ready to start on their day's work. The streets were deserted. Nicky took a long breath of the sweet morning air. He felt alert and well. He also felt as pleased as Punch. With a swinging stride, his shoulders well thrown back, he walked up the hill and along the gardens in front of the Casino—the flowers in that clear light had a dewy brilliance that was delicious—till he came to his hotel. Here the day had already begun. In the hall porters with mufflers round their necks and berets on their heads were busy sweeping. Nicky went up to his room and had a hot bath. He lay in it and thought with satisfaction that he was not such a mug as some people might think. After his bath he did his exercises, dressed, packed, and went down to breakfast. He had a grand appetite. No continental breakfast for him! He had grapefruit, porridge, bacon and eggs, rolls fresh from the oven, so crisp and delicious they melted in your mouth, marmalade, and three cups of coffee. Though feeling perfectly well before, he felt better after that. He lit the pipe he had recently learnt to smoke, paid his bill and stepped into the car that was waiting to take him to the aerodrome on the other side of Cannes. The road as far as Nice ran over the hills and below him was the blue sea and the coastline. He couldn't help thinking it damned pretty. They passed through Nice, so gay and friendly in the early morning, and presently they came to a long stretch of straight road that ran by the sea. Nicky had paid his bill, not with the money he had won the night before, but with the money his father had given him; he had changed a thousand francs to pay for supper at the Knickerbocker, but that deceitful little woman had returned him the thousand francs he had lent her, so that he still had twenty thousand-franc notes in his pocket. He thought he would like to have a look at them. He had so nearly lost them that they had a double value for him. He took them out of his hip-pocket into which for safety's sake he had stuffed them when he put on the suit he was travelling in, and counted them one by one. Something very strange had happened to them. Instead of there being twenty notes as there should have been there were twenty-six. He couldn't understand it at all. He counted them twice more. There was no doubt about it; somehow or other he had twenty-six thousand francs instead of the twenty he should have had. He couldn't make it out. He asked himself if it was possible that he had won more at the Sporting Club than he had realized. But no, that was out of the question; he distinctly remembered the man at the desk laying the notes out in four rows of five, and he had counted them himself. Suddenly the explanation occurred to him; when he had put his hand into the flower-pot, after taking out the cineraria, he had grabbed everything he felt there. The flower-pot was the little hussy's money-box and he had taken out not only his own money, but her savings as well. Nicky leant back in the car and burst into a roar of laughter. It was the funniest thing he had ever heard in his life. And when he thought of her going to the flower-pot some time later in the morning when she awoke, expecting to find the money she had so cleverly got away with, and finding, not only that it wasn't there, but that her own had gone too, he laughed more than ever. And so far as he was concerned there was nothing to do about it; he neither knew her name, nor the name of the hotel to which she had taken him. He couldn't return her money even if he wanted to.

"It serves her damned well right," he said.





This then was the story that Henry Garnet told his friends over the bridge-table, for the night before, after dinner when his wife and daughter had left them to their port, Nicky had narrated it in full.

"And you know what infuriated me is that he's so damned pleased with himself. Talk of a cat swallowing a canary. And d'you know what he said to me when he'd finished? He looked at me with those innocent eyes of his and said: 'You know, father, I can't help thinking there was something wrong about the advice you gave me. You said, don't gamble; well, I did, and I made a packet; you said, don't lend money; well, I did, and I got it back; and you said, don't have anything to do with women; well, I did, and made six thousand francs on the deal.'"

It didn't make it any better for Henry Garnet that his three companions burst out laughing.

"It's all very well for you fellows to laugh, but you know, I'm in a damned awkward position. The boy looked up to me, he respected me, he took whatever I said as gospel truth, and now, I saw it in his eyes, he just looks upon me as a drivelling old fool. It's no good my saying one swallow doesn't make a summer; he doesn't see that it was just a fluke, he thinks the whole thing was due to his own cleverness. It may ruin him."

"You do look a bit of a damned fool, old man," said one of the others. "There's no denying that, is there?"

"I know I do, and I don't like it. It's so dashed unfair. Fate has no right to play one tricks like that. After all, you must admit that my advice was good."

"Very good."

"And the wretched boy ought to have burnt his fingers. Well, he hasn't. You're all men of the world, you tell me how I'm to deal with the situation now."

But they none of them could.

"Well, Henry, if I were you I wouldn't worry," said the lawyer. "My belief is that your boy's born lucky, and in the long run that's better than to be born clever or rich."





Lord Mountdrago


Dr Audlin looked at the clock on his desk. It was twenty minutes to six. He was surprised that his patient was late, for Lord Mountdrago prided himself on his punctuality; he had a sententious way of expressing himself which gave the air of an epigram to a commonplace remark, and he was in the habit of saying that punctuality is a compliment you pay to the intelligent and a rebuke you administer to the stupid. Lord Mountdrago's appointment was for five-thirty.

There was in Dr Audlin's appearance nothing to attract attention. He was tall and spare, with narrow shoulders and something of a stoop; his hair was grey and thin; his long, sallow face deeply lined. He was not more than fifty, but he looked older. His eyes, pale-blue and rather large, were weary. When you had been with him for a while you noticed that they moved very little; they remained fixed on your face, but so empty of expression were they that it was no discomfort. They seldom lit up. They gave no clue to his thoughts nor changed with the words he spoke. If you were of an observant turn it might have struck you that he blinked much less often than most of us. His hands were on the large side, with long, tapering fingers; they were soft, but firm, cool but not clammy. You could never have said what Dr Audlin wore unless you had made a point of looking. His clothes were dark. His tie was black. His dress made his sallow lined face paler, and his pale eyes more wan. He gave you the impression of a very sick man.

Dr Audlin was a psycho-analyst. He had adopted the profession by accident and practised it with misgiving. When the war broke out he had not been long qualified and was getting experience at various hospitals; he offered his services to the authorities, and after a time was sent out to France. It was then that he discovered his singular gift. He could allay certain pains by the touch of his cool, firm hands, and by talking to them often induce sleep in men who were suffering from sleeplessness. He spoke slowly. His voice had no particular colour, and its tone did not alter with the words he uttered, but it was musical, soft, and lulling. He told the men that they must rest, that they mustn't worry, that they must sleep; and rest stole into their jaded bones, tranquillity pushed their anxieties away, like a man finding a place for himself on a crowded bench, and slumber fell on their tired eyelids like the light rain of spring upon the fresh-turned earth. Dr Audlin found that by speaking to men with that low, monotonous voice of his, by looking at them with his pale, quiet eyes, by stroking their weary foreheads with his long firm hands, he could soothe their perturbations, resolve the conflicts that distracted them, and banish the phobias that made their lives a torment. Sometimes he effected cures that seemed miraculous. He restored speech to a man who, after being buried under the earth by a bursting shell, had been struck dumb, and he gave back the use of his limbs to another who had been paralysed after a crash in a plane. He could not understand his powers; he was of a sceptical turn, and though they say that in circumstances of this kind the first thing is to believe in yourself, he never quite succeeded in doing that; and it was only the outcome of his activities, patent to the most incredulous observer, that obliged him to admit that he had some faculty, coming from he knew not where, obscure and uncertain, that enabled him to do things for which he could offer no explanation. When the war was over he went to Vienna and studied there, and afterwards to Zürich; and then settled down in London to practise the art he had so strangely acquired. He had been practising now for fifteen years, and had attained, in the speciality he followed, a distinguished reputation. People told one another of the amazing things he had done, and though his fees were high, he had as many patients as he had time to see. Dr Audlin knew that he had achieved some very extraordinary results; he had saved men from suicide, others from the lunatic asylum, he had assuaged griefs that embittered useful lives, he had turned unhappy marriages into happy ones, he had eradicated abnormal instincts and thus delivered not a few from a hateful bondage, he had given health to the sick in spirit; he had done all this, and yet at the back of his mind remained the suspicion that he was little more than a quack.

It went against his grain to exercise a power that he could not understand, and it offended his honesty to trade on the faith of the people he treated when he had no faith in himself. He was rich enough now to live without working, and the work exhausted him; a dozen times he had been on the point of giving up practice. He knew all that Freud and Jung and the rest of them had written. He was not satisfied; he had an intimate conviction that all their theory was hocus-pocus, and yet there the results were, incomprehensible, but manifest. And what had he not seen of human nature during the fifteen years that patients had been coming to his dingy back room in Wimpole Street? The revelations that had been poured into his ears, sometimes only too willingly, sometimes with shame, with reservations, with anger, had long ceased to surprise him. Nothing could shock him any longer. He knew by now that men were liars, he knew how extravagant was their vanity; he knew far worse than that about them; but he knew that it was not for him to judge or to condemn. But year by year as these terrible confidences were imparted to him his face grew a little greyer, its lines a little more marked, and his pale eyes more weary. He seldom laughed, but now and again when for relaxation he read a novel he smiled. Did their authors really think the men and women they wrote of were like that? If they only knew how much more complicated they were, how much more unexpected, what irreconcilable elements coexisted within their souls and what dark and sinister contentions afflicted them!

It was a quarter to six. Of all the strange cases he had been called upon to deal with Dr Audlin could remember none stranger than that of Lord Mountdrago. For one thing the personality of his patient made it singular. Lord Mountdrago was an able and a distinguished man. Appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs when still under forty, now after three years in office he had seen his policy prevail. It was generally acknowledged that he was the ablest politician in the Conservative Party and only the fact that his father was a peer, on whose death he would no longer be able to sit in the House of Commons, made it impossible for him to aim at the premiership. But if in these democratic times it is out of the question for a Prime Minister of England to be in the House of Lords, there was nothing to prevent Lord Mountdrago from continuing to be Secretary for Foreign Affairs in successive Conservative administrations and so for long directing the foreign policy of his country.

Lord Mountdrago had many good qualities. He had intelligence and industry. He was widely travelled, and spoke several languages fluently. From early youth he had specialized in foreign affairs, and had conscientiously made himself acquainted with the political and economic circumstances of other countries. He had courage, insight, and determination. He was a good speaker, both on the platform and in the House, clear, precise, and often witty. He was a brilliant debater and his gift of repartee was celebrated. He had a fine presence: he was a tall, handsome man, rather bald and somewhat too stout, but this gave him solidity and an air of maturity that were of service to him. As a young man he had been something of an athlete and had rowed in the Oxford boat, and he was known to be one of the best shots in England. At twenty-four he had married a girl of eighteen whose father was a duke and her mother a great American heiress, so that she had both position and wealth, and by her he had had two sons. For several years they had lived privately apart, but in public united, so that appearances were saved, and no other attachment on either side had given the gossips occasion to whisper. Lord Mountdrago indeed was too ambitious, too hard-working, and it must be added too patriotic, to be tempted by any pleasures that might interfere with his career. He had, in short, a great deal to make him a popular and successful figure. He had unfortunately great defects.

He was a fearful snob. You would not have been surprised at this if his father had been the first holder of the title. That the son of an ennobled lawyer, a manufacturer, or a distiller should attach an inordinate importance to his rank is understandable. The earldom held by Lord Mountdrago's father was created by Charles II, and the barony held by the first Earl dated from the Wars of the Roses. For three hundred years the successive holders of the title had allied themselves with the noblest families of England. But Lord Mountdrago was as conscious of his birth as a nouveau riche is conscious of his money. He never missed an opportunity of impressing it upon others. He had beautiful manners when he chose to display them, but this he did only with people whom he regarded as his equals. He was coldly insolent to those whom he looked upon as his social inferiors. He was rude to his servants and insulting to his secretaries. The subordinate officials in the government offices to which he had been successively attached feared and hated him. His arrogance was horrible. He knew that he was a great deal cleverer than most of the persons he had to do with, and never hesitated to apprise them of the fact. He had no patience with the infirmities of human nature. He felt himself born to command and was irritated with people who expected him to listen to their arguments or wished to hear the reasons for his decisions. He was immeasurably selfish. He looked upon any service that was rendered him as a right due to his rank and intelligence and therefore deserving of no gratitude. It never entered his head that he was called upon to do anything for others. He had many enemies: he despised them. He knew no one who merited his assistance, his sympathy, or his compassion. He had no friends. He was distrusted by his chiefs, because they doubted his loyalty; he was unpopular with his party, because he was overbearing and discourteous; and yet his merit was so great, his patriotism so evident, his intelligence so solid, and his management of affairs so brilliant that they had to put up with him. And what made it possible to do this was that on occasion he could be enchanting; when he was with persons whom he considered his equals, or whom he wished to captivate, in the company of foreign dignitaries or women of distinction, he could be gay, witty, and debonair; his manners then reminded you that in his veins ran the same blood as had run in the veins of Lord Chesterfield; he could tell a story with point, he could be natural, sensible, and even profound. You were surprised at the extent of his knowledge and the sensitiveness of his taste. You thought him the best company in the world; you forgot that he had insulted you the day before and was quite capable of cutting you dead the next.

Lord Mountdrago almost failed to become Dr Audlin's patient. A secretary rang up the doctor and told him that his lordship, wishing to consult him, would be glad if he would come to his house at ten o'clock on the following morning. Dr Audlin answered that he was unable to go to Lord Mountdrago's house, but would be pleased to give him an appointment at his consulting-room at five o'clock on the next day but one. The secretary took the message and presently rang back to say that Lord Mountdrago insisted on seeing Dr Audlin in his own house and the doctor could fix his own fee. Dr Audlin replied that he only saw patients in his consulting-room and expressed his regret that unless Lord Mountdrago was prepared to come to him he could not give him his attention. In a quarter of an hour a brief message was delivered to him that his lordship would come not next day but one, but next day, at five.

When Lord Mountdrago was then shown in he did not come forward, but stood at the door and insolently looked the doctor up and down. Dr Audlin perceived that he was in a rage; he gazed at him, silently, with still eyes. He saw a big heavy man, with greying hair, receding on the forehead so that it gave nobility to his brow, a puffy face with bold regular features and an expression of haughtiness. He had somewhat the look of one of the Bourbon sovereigns of the eighteenth century.

"It seems that it is as difficult to see you as a Prime Minister, Dr Audlin. I'm an extremely busy man."

"Won't you sit down?" said the doctor.

His face showed no sign that Lord Mountdrago's speech in any way affected him. Dr Audlin sat in his chair at the desk. Lord Mountdrago still stood and his frown darkened.

"I think I should tell you that I am His Majesty's Secretary for Foreign Affairs," he said acidly.

"Won't you sit down?" the doctor repeated.

Lord Mountdrago made a gesture, which might have suggested that he was about to turn on his heel and stalk out of the room; but if that was his intentionhe apparently thought better of it. He seated himself. Dr Audlin opened a large book and took up his pen. He wrote without looking at his patient.

"How old are you?"

"Forty-two."

"Are you married?"

"Yes."

"How long have you been married?"

"Eighteen years."

"Have you any children?"

"I have two sons."

Dr Audlin noted down the facts as Lord Mountdrago abruptly answered his questions. Then he leaned back in his chair and looked at him. He did not speak; he just looked, gravely, with pale eyes that did not move.

"Why have you come to see me?" he asked at length.

"I've heard about you. Lady Canute is a patient of yours, I understand. She tells me you've done her a certain amount of good."

Dr Audlin did not reply. His eyes remained fixed on the other's face, but they were so empty of expression that you might have thought he did not even see him.

"I can't do miracles," he said at length. Not a smile, but the shadow of a smile flickered in his eyes. "The Royal College of Physicians would not approve of it if I did."

Lord Mountdrago gave a brief chuckle. It seemed to lessen his hostility. He spoke more amiably.

"You have a very remarkable reputation. People seem to believe in you."

"Why have you come to me?" repeated Dr Audlin.

Now it was Lord Mountdrago's turn to be silent. It looked as though he found it hard to answer. Dr Audlin waited. At last Lord Mountdrago seemed to make an effort. He spoke.

"I'm in perfect health. Just as a matter of routine I had myself examined by my own doctor the other day, Sir Augustus Fitzherbert, I dare say you've heard of him, and he tells me I have the physique of a man of thirty. I work hard, but I'm never tired, and I enjoy my work. I smoke very little and I'm an extremely moderate drinker. I take a sufficiency of exercise and I lead a regular life. I am a perfectly sound, normal, healthy man. I quite expect you to think it very silly and childish of me to consult you."

Dr Audlin saw that he must help him.

"I don't know if I can do anything to help you. I'll try. You're distressed?"

Lord Mountdrago frowned.

"The work that I'm engaged in is important. The decisions I am called upon to make can easily affect the welfare of the country and even the peace of the world. It is essential that my judgement should be balanced and my brain clear. I look upon it as my duty to eliminate any cause of worry that may interfere with my usefulness."

Dr Audlin had never taken his eyes off him. He saw a great deal. He saw behind his patient's pompous manner and arrogant pride an anxiety that he could not dispel.

"I asked you to be good enough to come here because I know by experience that it's easier for someone to speak openly in the dingy surroundings of a doctor's consulting-room than in his accustomed environment."

"They're certainly dingy," said Lord Mountdrago acidly. He paused. It was evident that this man who had so much self-assurance, so quick and decided a mind that he was never at a loss, at this moment was embarrassed. He smiled in order to show the doctor that he was at his ease, but his eyes betrayed his disquiet. When he spoke again it was with unnatural heartiness.

"The whole thing's so trivial that I can hardly bring myself to bother you with it. I'm afraid you'll just tell me not to be a fool and waste your valuable time."

"Even things that seem very trivial may have their importance. They can be a symptom of a deep-seated derangement. And my time is entirely at your disposal."

Dr Audlin's voice was low and grave. The monotone in which he spoke was strangely soothing. Lord Mountdrago at length made up his mind to be frank.

"The fact is I've been having some very tiresome dreams lately. I know it's silly to pay any attention to them, but—well, the honest truth is that I'm afraid they've got on my nerves."

"Can you describe any of them to me?"

Lord Mountdrago smiled, but the smile that tried to be careless was only rueful.

"They're so idiotic, I can hardly bring myself to narrate them."

"Never mind."

"Well, the first I had was about a month ago. I dreamt that I was at a party at Connemara House. It was an official party. The King and Queen were to be there and of course decorations were worn. I was wearing my ribbon and my star. I went into a sort of cloakroom they have to take off my coat. There was a little man there called Owen Griffiths, who's a Welsh Member of Parliament, and to tell you the truth, I was surprised to see him. He's very common, and I said to myself: 'Really, Lydia Connemara is going too far, whom will she ask next?' I thought he looked at me rather curiously, but I didn't take any notice of him; in fact I cut the little bounder and walked upstairs. I suppose you've never been there?"

"Never."

"No, it's not the sort of house you'd ever be likely to go to. It's a rather vulgar house, but it's got a very fine marble staircase, and the Connemaras were at the top receiving their guests. Lady Connemara gave me a look of surprise when I shook hands with her, and began to giggle; I didn't pay much attention, she's a very silly, ill-bred woman and her manners are no better than those of her ancestor whom King Charles II made a duchess. I must say the reception rooms at Connemara House are stately. I walked through, nodding to a number of people and shaking hands; then I saw the German Ambassador talking with one of the Austrian Archdukes. I particularly wanted to have a word with him, so I went up and held out my hand. The moment the Archduke saw me he burst into a roar of laughter. I was deeply affronted. I looked him up and down sternly, but he only laughed the more. I was about to speak to him rather sharply, when there was a sudden hush and I realized that the King and Queen had come. Turning my back on the Archduke, I stepped forward, and then, quite suddenly, I noticed that I hadn't got any trousers on. I was in short silk drawers, and I wore scarlet sock-suspenders. No wonder Lady Connemara had giggled; no wonder the Archduke had laughed! I can't tell you what that moment was. An agony of shame. I awoke in a cold sweat. Oh, you don't know the relief I felt to find it was only a dream."

"It's the kind of dream that's not so very uncommon," said Dr Audlin.

"I dare say not. But an odd thing happened next day. I was in the lobby of the House of Commons, when that fellow Griffiths walked slowly past me. He deliberately looked down at my legs and then he looked me full in the face and I was almost certain he winked. A ridiculous thought came to me. He'd been there the night before and seen me make that ghastly exhibition of myself and was enjoying the joke. But of course I knew that was impossible because it was only a dream. I gave him an icy glare and he walked on. But he was grinning his head off."

Lord Mountdrago took his handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped the palms of his hands. He was making no attempt now to conceal his perturbation. Dr Audlin never took his eyes off him.

"Tell me another dream."

"It was the night after, and it was even more absurd than the first one. I dreamt that I was in the House. There was a debate on foreign affairs which not only the country, but the world, had been looking forward to with the gravest concern. The government had decided on a change in their policy which vitally affected the future of the Empire. The occasion was historic. Of course the House was crowded. All the ambassadors were there. The galleries were packed. It fell to me to make the important speech of the evening. I had prepared it carefully. A man like me has enemies, there are a lot of people who resent my having achieved the position I have at an age when even the cleverest men are content with situations of relative obscurity, and I was determined that my speech should not only be worthy of the occasion, but should silence my detractors. It excited me to think that the whole world was hanging on my lips. I rose to my feet. If you've ever been in the House you'll know how members chat to one another during a debate, rustle papers and turn over reports. The silence was the silence of the grave when I began to speak. Suddenly I caught sight of that odious little bounder on one of the benches opposite, Griffiths the Welsh member; he put out his tongue at me. I don't know if you've ever heard a vulgar music-hall song called A Bicycle Made for Two. It was very popular a great many years ago. To show Griffiths how completely I despised him I began to sing it. I sang the first verse right through. There was a moment's surprise, and when I finished they cried 'Hear, hear,' on the opposite benches. I put up my hand to silence them and sang the second verse. The House listened to me in stony silence and I felt the song wasn't going down very well. I was vexed, for I have a good baritone voice, and I was determined that they should do me justice. When I started the third verse the members began to laugh; in an instant the laughter spread; the ambassadors, the strangers in the Distinguished Strangers' Gallery, the ladies in the Ladies' Gallery, the reporters, they shook, they bellowed, they held their sides, they rolled in their seats; everyone was overcome with laughter except the ministers on the Front Bench immediately behind me. In that incredible, in that unprecedented uproar, they sat petrified. I gave them a glance, and suddenly the enormity of what I had done fell upon me. I had made myself the laughing-stock of the whole world. With misery I realized that I should have to resign. I woke and knew it was only a dream."

Lord Mountdrago's grand manner had deserted him as he narrated this, and now having finished he was pale and trembling. But with an effort he pulled himself together. He forced a laugh to his shaking lips.

"The whole thing was so fantastic that I couldn't help being amused. I didn't give it another thought, and when I went into the House on the following afternoon I was feeling in very good form. The debate was dull, but I had to be there, and I read some documents that required my attention. For some reason I chanced to look up and I saw that Griffiths was speaking. He has an unpleasant Welsh accent and an unprepossessing appearance. I couldn't imagine that he had anything to say that it was worth my while to listen to, and I was about to return to my papers when he quoted two lines from A Bicycle Made for Two. I couldn't help glancing at him and I saw that his eyes were fixed on me with a grin of bitter mockery. I faintly shrugged my shoulders. It was comic that a scrubby little Welsh member should look at me like that. It was an odd coincidence that he should quote two lines from that disastrous song that I'd sung all through in my dream. I began to read my papers again, but I don't mind telling you that I found it difficult to concentrate on them. I was a little puzzled. Owen Griffiths had been in my first dream, the one at Connemara House, and I'd received a very definite impression afterwards that he knew the sorry figure I'd cut. Was it a mere coincidence that he had just quoted those two lines? I asked myself if it was possible that he was dreaming the same dreams as I was. But of course the idea was preposterous and I determined not to give it a second thought."

There was a silence. Dr Audlin looked at Lord Mountdrago and Lord Mountdrago looked at Dr Audlin.

"Other people's dreams are very boring. My wife used to dream occasionally and insist on telling me her dreams next day with circumstantial detail. I found it maddening."

Dr Audlin faintly smiled.

"You're not boring me."

"I'll tell you one more dream I had a few days later. I dreamt that I went into a public-house at Limehouse. I've never been to Limehouse in my life and I don't think I've ever been in a public-house since I was at Oxford, and yet I saw the street and the place I went into as exactly as if I were at home there. I went into a room, I don't know whether they call it the saloon bar or the private bar; there was a fireplace and a large leather arm-chair on one side of it, and on the other a small sofa; a bar ran the whole length of the room and over it you could see into the public bar. Near the door was a round marble-topped table and two arm-chairs beside it. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed. It was brightly lit, but the smoke was so thick that it made my eyes smart. I was dressed like a rough, with a cap on my head and a handkerchief round my neck. It seemed to me that most of the people there were drunk. I thought it rather amusing. There was a gramophone going, or the radio, I don't know which, and in front of the fireplace two women were doing a grotesque dance. There was a little crowd round them, laughing, cheering, and singing. I went up to have a look and some man said to me: ''Ave a drink, Bill?' There were glasses on the table full of a dark liquid which I understand is called brown ale. He gave me a glass and not wishing to be conspicuous I drank it. One of the women who were dancing broke away from the other and took hold of the glass. 'Ere, what's the idea?' she said. 'That's my beer you're putting away.' 'Oh, I'm so sorry,' I said, 'this gentleman offered it me and I very naturally thought it was his to offer.' 'All right, mate,' she said, 'I don't mind. You come an' 'ave a dance with me.' Before I could protest she'd caught hold of me and we were dancing together. And then I found myself sitting in the arm-chair with the woman on my lap and we were sharing a glass of beer. I should tell you that sex has never played any great part in my life. I married young because in my position it was desirable that I should marry, but also in order to settle once for all the question of sex. I had the two sons I had made up my mind to have, and then I put the whole matter on one side. I've always been too busy to give much thought to that kind of thing, and living so much in the public eye as I do it would have been madness to do anything that might give rise to scandal. The greatest asset a politician can have is a blameless record as far as women are concerned. I have no patience with the men who smash up their careers for women. I only despise them. The woman I had on my knees was drunk; she wasn't pretty and she wasn't young; in fact, she was just a blowsy old prostitute. She filled me with disgust, and yet when she put her mouth to mine and kissed me, though her breath stank of beer and her teeth were decayed, though I loathed myself, I wanted her—I wanted her with all my soul. Suddenly I heard a voice. 'That's right, old boy, have a good time.' I looked up and there was Owen Griffiths. I tried to spring out of the chair, but that horrible woman wouldn't let me. 'Don't you pay no attention to 'im,' she said, ''e's only one of them nosy-parkers.' 'You go to it,' he said. 'I know Moll. She'll give you your money's worth all right.' You know, I wasn't so much annoyed at his seeing me in that absurd situation as angry that he should address me as 'old boy'. I pushed the woman aside and stood up and faced him. 'I don't know you and I don't want to know you,' I said. 'I know you all right,' he said. 'And my advice to you, Molly, is, see that you get your money, he'll bilk you if he can.' There was a bottle of beer on the table close by. Without a word I seized it by the neck and hit him over the head with it as hard as I could. I made such a violent gesture that it woke me up."

"A dream of that sort is not incomprehensible," said Dr Audlin. "It is the revenge nature takes on persons of unimpeachable character."

"The story's idiotic. I haven't told it you for its own sake. I've told it you for what happened next day. I wanted to look up something in a hurry and I went into the library of the House. I got the book and began reading. I hadn't noticed when I sat down that Griffiths was sitting in a chair close by me. Another of the Labour Members came in and went up to him. 'Hullo, Owen,' he said to him, 'you're looking pretty dicky today.' 'I've got an awful headache,' he answered. 'I feel as if I'd been cracked over the head with a bottle.'"

Now Lord Mountdrago's face was grey with anguish.

"I knew then that the idea I'd had and dismissed as preposterous was true. I knew that Griffiths was dreaming my dreams and that he remembered them as well as I did."

"It may also have been a coincidence."

"When he spoke he didn't speak to his friend, he deliberately spoke to me. He looked at me with sullen resentment."

"Can you offer any suggestion why this same man should come into your dreams?"

"None."

Dr Audlin's eyes had not left his patient's face and he saw that he lied. He had a pencil in his hand and he drew a straggling line or two on his blotting-paper. It often took a long time to get people to tell the truth, and yet they knew that unless they told it he could do nothing for them.

"The dream you've just described to me took place just over three weeks ago. Have you had any since?"

"Every night."

"And does this man Griffiths come into them all?"

"Yes."

The doctor drew more lines on his blotting-paper. He wanted the silence, the drabness, the dull light of that little room to have its effect on Lord Mountdrago's sensibility. Lord Mountdrago threw himself back in his chair and turned his head away so that he should not see the other's grave eyes.

"Dr Audlin, you must do something for me. I'm at the end of my tether. I shall go mad if this goes on. I'm afraid to go to sleep. Two or three nights I haven't. I've sat up reading and when I felt drowsy put on my coat and walked till I was exhausted. But I must have sleep. With all the work I have to do I must be at concert pitch; I must be in complete control of all my faculties. I need rest; sleep brings me none. I no sooner fall asleep than my dreams begin, and he's always there, that vulgar little cad, grinning at me, mocking me, despising me. It's a monstrous persecution. I tell you, doctor, I'm not the man of my dreams; it's not fair to judge me by them. Ask anyone you like. I'm an honest, upright, decent man. No one can say anything against my moral character either private or public. My whole ambition is to serve my country and maintain its greatness. I have money, I have rank, I'm not exposed to many of the temptations of lesser men, so that it's no credit to me to be incorruptible; but this I can claim, that no honour, no personal advantage, no thought of self would induce me to swerve by a hair's breadth from my duty. I've sacrificed everything to become the man I am. Greatness is my aim. Greatness is within my reach and I'm losing my nerve. I'm not that mean, despicable, cowardly, lewd creature that horrible little man sees. I've told you three of my dreams; they're nothing; that man has seen me do things that are so beastly, so horrible, so shameful, that even if my life depended on it I wouldn't tell them. And he remembers them. I can hardly meet the derision and disgust I see in his eyes and I even hesitate to speak because I know my words can seem to him nothing but utter humbug. He's seen me do things that no man with any self-respect would do, things for which men are driven out of the society of their fellows and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment; he's heard the foulness of my speech; he's seen me not only ridiculous, but revolting. He despises me and he no longer pretends to conceal it. I tell you that if you can't do something to help me I shall either kill myself or kill him."

"I wouldn't kill him if I were you," said Dr Audlin, coolly, in that soothing voice of his. "In this country the consequences of killing a fellow-creature are awkward."

"I shouldn't be hanged for it, if that's what you mean. Who would know that I'd killed him? That dream of mine has shown me how. I told you, the day after I'd hit him over the head with a beer-bottle he had such a headache that he couldn't see straight. He said so himself. That shows that he can feel with his waking body what happens to his body asleep. It's not with a bottle I shall hit him next time. One night, when I'm dreaming, I shall find myself with a knife in my hand or a revolver in my pocket, I must because I want to so intensely, and then I shall seize my opportunity. I'll stick him like a pig; I'll shoot him like a dog. In the heart. And then I shall be free of this fiendish persecution."

Some people might have thought that Lord Mountdrago was mad; after all the years during which Dr Audlin had been treating the diseased souls of men he knew how thin a line divides those whom we call sane from those whom we call insane. He knew how often in men who to all appearance were healthy and normal, who were seemingly devoid of imagination, and who fulfilled the duties of common life with credit to themselves and with benefit to their fellows, when you gained their confidence, when you tore away the mask they wore to the world, you found not only hideous abnormality, but kinks so strange, mental extravagances so fantastic, that in that respect you could call them lunatic. If you put them in an asylum not all the asylums in the world would be large enough. Anyhow, a man was not certifiable because he had strange dreams and they had shattered his nerve. The case was singular, but it was only an exaggeration of others that had come under Dr Audlin's observation; he was doubtful, however, whether the methods of treatment that he had so often found efficacious would here avail.

"Have you consulted any other member of my profession?" he asked.

"Only Sir Augustus. I merely told him that I suffered from nightmares. He said I was overworked and recommended me to go for a cruise. That's absurd. I can't leave the Foreign Office just now when the international situation needs constant attention. I'm indispensable, and I know it. On my conduct at the present juncture my whole future depends. He gave me sedatives. They had no effect. He gave me tonics. They were worse than useless. He's an old fool."

"Can you give any reason why it should be this particular man who persists in coming into your dreams?"

"You asked me that question before. I answered it."

That was true. But Dr Audlin had not been satisfied with the answer.

"Just now you talked of persecution. Why should Owen Griffiths want to persecute you?"

"I don't know."

Lord Mountdrago's eyes shifted a little. Dr Audlin was sure that he was not speaking the truth.

"Have you ever done him an injury?"

"Never."

Lord Mountdrago made no movement, but Dr Audlin had a queer feeling that he shrank into his skin. He saw before him a large, proud man who gave the impression that the questions put to him were an insolence, and yet for all that, behind that facade, was something shifting and startled that made you think of a frightened animal in a trap. Dr Audlin leaned forward and by the power of his eyes forced Lord Mountdrago to meet them.

"Are you quite sure?"

"Quite sure. You don't seem to understand that our ways lead along different paths. I don't wish to harp on it, but I must remind you that I am a Minister of the Crown and Griffiths is an obscure member of the Labour Party. Naturally there's no social connection between us; he's a man of very humble origin, he's not the sort of person I should be likely to meet at any of the houses I go to; and politically our respective stations are so far separated that we could not possibly have anything in common."

"I can do nothing for you unless you tell me the complete truth."

Lord Mountdrago raised his eyebrows. His voice was rasping.

"I'm not accustomed to having my word doubted, Dr Audlin. If you're going to do that I think to take up any more of your time can only be a waste of mine. If you will kindly let my secretary know what your fee is he will see that a cheque is sent to you."

For all the expression that was to be seen on Dr Audlin's face you might have thought that he simply had not heard what Lord Mountdrago said. He continued to look steadily into his eyes and his voice was grave and low.

"Have you done anything to this man that he might look upon as an injury?"

Lord Mountdrago hesitated. He looked away, and then, as though there were in Dr Audlin's eyes a compelling force that he could not resist, looked back. He answered sulkily:

"Only if he was a dirty, second-rate little cad."

"But that is exactly what you've described him to be."

Lord Mountdrago sighed. He was beaten. Dr Audlin knew that the sigh meant he was going at last to say what he had till then held back. Now he had no longer to insist. He dropped his eyes and began again drawing vague geometrical figures on his blotting-paper. The silence lasted two or three minutes.

"I'm anxious to tell you everything that can be of any use to you. If I didn't mention this before, it's only because it was so unimportant that I didn't see how it could possibly have anything to do with the case. Griffiths won a seat at the last election and he began to make a nuisance of himself almost at once. His father's a miner, and he worked in a mine himself when he was a boy; he's been a schoolmaster in the board schools and a journalist. He's that half-baked, conceited intellectual, with inadequate knowledge, ill-considered ideas, and impracticable plans, that compulsory education has brought forth from the working-classes. He's a scrawny, grey-faced man, who looks half-starved, and he's always very slovenly in appearance; heaven knows members nowadays don't bother much about their dress, but his clothes are an outrage to the dignity of the House. They're ostentatiously shabby, his collar's never clean and his tie's never tied properly; he looks as if he hadn't had a bath for a month and his hands are filthy. The Labour Party have two or three fellows on the Front Bench who've got a certain ability, but the rest of them don't amount to much. In the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king: because Griffiths is glib and has a lot of superficial information on a number of subjects, the Whips on his side began to put him up to speak whenever there was a chance. It appeared that he fancied himself on foreign affairs, and he was continually asking me silly, tiresome questions. I don't mind telling you that I made a point of snubbing him as soundly as I thought he deserved. From the beginning I hated the way he talked, his whining voice and his vulgar accent; he had nervous mannerisms that intensely irritated me. He talked rather shyly, hesitatingly, as though it were torture to him to speak and yet he was forced on by some inner passion, and often he used to say some very disconcerting things. I'll admit that now and again he had a sort of tub-thumping eloquence. It had a certain influence over the ill-regulated minds of the members of his party. They were impressed by his earnestness and they weren't, as I was, nauseated by his sentimentality. A certain sentimentality is the common coin of political debate. Nations are governed by self-interest, but they prefer to believe that their aims are altruistic, and the politician is justified if with fair words and fine phrases he can persuade the electorate that the hard bargain he is driving for his country's advantage tends to the good of humanity. The mistake people like Griffiths make is to take these fair words and fine phrases at their face value. He's a crank, and a noxious crank. He calls himself an idealist. He has at his tongue's end all the tedious blather that the intelligentsia have been boring us with for years. Non-resistance. The brotherhood of man. You know the hopeless rubbish. The worst of it was that it impressed not only his own party, it even shook some of the sillier, more sloppy-minded members of ours. I heard rumours that Griffiths was likely to get office when a Labour Government came in; I even heard it suggested that he might get the Foreign Office. The notion was grotesque but not impossible. One day I had occasion to wind up a debate on foreign affairs which Griffiths had opened. He'd spoken for an hour. I thought it a very good opportunity to cook his goose, and by God, sir, I cooked it. I tore his speech to pieces. I pointed out the faultiness of his reasoning and emphasized the deficiency of his knowledge. In the House of Commons the most devastating weapon is ridicule: I mocked him; I bantered him; I was in good form that day and the House rocked with laughter. Their laughter excited me and I excelled myself. The Opposition sat glum and silent, but even some of them couldn't help laughing once or twice; it's not intolerable, you know, to see a colleague, perhaps a rival, made a fool of. And if ever a man was made a fool of I made a fool of Griffiths. He shrank down in a seat, I saw his face go white, and presently he buried it in his hands. When I sat down I'd killed him. I'd destroyed his prestige for ever; he had no more chance of getting office when a Labour Government came in than the policeman at the door. I heard afterwards that his father, the old miner, and his mother had come up from Wales, with various supporters of his in the constituency, to watch the triumph they expected him to have. They had seen only his utter humiliation. He'd won the constituency by the narrowest margin. An incident like that might very easily lose him his seat. But that was no business of mine."

"Should I be putting it too strongly if I said you had ruined his career?" asked Dr Audlin.

"I don't suppose you would."

"That is a very serious injury you've done him."

"He brought it on himself."

"Have you never felt any qualms about it?"

"I think perhaps if I'd known that his father and mother were there I might have let him down a little more gently."

There was nothing further for Dr Audlin to say, and he set about treating his patient in such a manner as he thought might avail. He sought by suggestion to make him forget his dreams when he awoke; he sought to make him sleep so deeply that he would not dream. He found Lord Mountdrago's resistance impossible to break down. At the end of an hour he dismissed him. Since then he had seen Lord Mountdrago half a dozen times. He had done him no good. The frightful dreams continued every night to harass the unfortunate man, and it was clear that his general condition was growing rapidly worse. He was worn out. His irritability was uncontrollable. Lord Mountdrago was angry because he received no benefit from his treatment, and yet continued it, not only because it seemed his only hope, but because it was a relief to him to have someone with whom he could talk openly. Dr Audlin came to the conclusion at last that there was only one way in which Lord Mountdrago could achieve deliverance, but he knew him well enough to be assured that of his own free will he would never, never take it. If Lord Mountdrago was to be saved from the breakdown that was threatening he must be induced to take a step that must be abhorrent to his pride of birth and his self-complacency. Dr Audlin was convinced that to delay was impossible. He was treating his patient by suggestion, and after several visits found him more susceptible to it. At length he managed to get him into a condition of somnolence. With his low, soft, monotonous voice he soothed his tortured nerves. He repeated the same words over and over again. Lord Mountdrago lay quite still, his eyes closed; his breathing was regular, and his limbs were relaxed. Then Dr Audlin in the same quiet tone spoke the words he had prepared.

"You will go to Owen Griffiths and say that you are sorry that you caused him that great injury. You will say that you will do whatever lies in your power to undo the harm that you have done him."

The words acted on Lord Mountdrago like the blow of a whip across his face. He shook himself out of his hypnotic state and sprang to his feet. His eyes blazed with passion and he poured forth upon Dr Audlin a stream of angry vituperation such as even he had never heard. He swore at him. He cursed him. He used language of such obscenity that Dr Audlin, who had heard every sort of foul word, sometimes from the lips of chaste and distinguished women, was surprised that he knew it.

"Apologize to that filthy little Welshman? I'd rather kill myself."

"I believe it to be the only way in which you can regain your balance."

Dr Audlin had not often seen a man presumably sane in such a condition of uncontrollable fury. He grew red in the face and his eyes bulged out of his head. He did really foam at the mouth. Dr Audlin watched him coolly, waiting for the storm to wear itself out, and presently he saw that Lord Mountdrago, weakened by the strain to which he had been subjected for so many weeks, was exhausted.

"Sit down," he said then, sharply.

Lord Mountdrago crumpled up into a chair.

"Christ, I feel all in. I must rest a minute and then I'll go."

For five minutes perhaps they sat in complete silence. Lord Mountdrago was a gross, blustering bully, but he was also a gentleman. When he broke the silence he had recovered his self-control.

"I'm afraid I've been very rude to you. I'm ashamed of the things I've said to you and I can only say you'd be justified if you refused to have anything more to do with me. I hope you won't do that. I feel that my visits to you do help me. I think you're my only chance."

"You mustn't give another thought to what you said. It was of no consequence."

"But there's one thing you mustn't ask me to do, and that is to make excuses to Griffiths."

"I've thought a great deal about your case I don't pretend to understand it, but I believe that your only chance of release is to do what I proposed. I have a notion that we're none of us one self, but many, and one of the selves in you has risen up against the injury you did Griffiths and has taken on the form of Griffiths in your mind and is punishing you for what you cruelly did. If I were a priest I should tell you that it is your conscience that has adopted the shape and lineaments of this man to scourge you to repentance and persuade you to reparation."

"My conscience is clear. It's not my fault if I smashed the man's career. I crushed him like a slug in my garden. I regret nothing."

It was on these words that Lord Mountdrago had left him. Reading through his notes, while he waited, Dr Audlin considered how best he could bring his patient to the state of mind that, now that his usual methods of treatment had failed, he thought alone could help him. He glanced at his clock. It was six. It was strange that Lord Mountdrago did not come. He knew he had intended to because a secretary had rung up that morning to say that he would be with him at the usual hour. He must have been detained by pressing work. This notion gave Dr Audlin something else to think of: Lord Mountdrago was quite unfit for work and in no condition to deal with important matters of state. Dr Audlin wondered whether it behoved him to get in touch with someone in authority, the Prime Minister or the Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and impart to him his conviction that Lord Mountdrago's mind was so unbalanced that it was dangerous to leave affairs of moment in his hands. It was a ticklish thing to do. He might cause needless trouble and get roundly snubbed for his pains. He shrugged his shoulders.

"After all," he reflected, "the politicians have made such a mess of the world during the last five-and-twenty years, I don't suppose it makes much odds if they're mad or sane."

He rang the bell.

"If Lord Mountdrago comes now will you tell him that I have another appointment at six-fifteen and so I'm afraid I can't see him."

"Very good, sir."

"Has the evening paper come yet?"

"I'll go and see."

In a moment the servant brought it in. A huge headline ran across the front page: Tragic Death of Foreign Minister.

"My God!" cried Dr Audlin.

For once he was wrenched out of his wonted calm. He was shocked, horribly shocked, and yet he was not altogether surprised. The possibility that Lord Mountdrago might commit suicide had occurred to him several times, for that it was suicide he could not doubt. The paper said that Lord Mountdrago had been waiting in a Tube station, standing on the edge of the platform, and as the train came in was seen to fall on the rail. It was supposed that he had had a sudden attack of faintness. The paper went on to say that Lord Mountdrago had been suffering for some weeks from the effects of overwork, but had felt it impossible to absent himself while the foreign situation demanded his unremitting attention. Lord Mountdrago was another victim of the strain that modern politics placed upon those who played the more important parts in it. There was a neat little piece about the talents and industry, the patriotism and vision, of the deceased statesman, followed by various surmises upon the Prime Minister's choice of his successor. Dr Audlin read all this. He had not liked Lord Mountdrago. The chief emotion that his death caused in him was dissatisfaction with himself because he had been able to do nothing for him.

Perhaps he had done wrong in not getting into touch with Lord Mountdrago's doctor. He was discouraged, as always when failure frustrated his conscientious efforts, and repulsion seized him for the theory and practice of this empiric doctrine by which he earned his living. He was dealing with dark and mysterious forces that it was perhaps beyond the powers of the human mind to understand. He was like a man blindfold trying to feel his way to he knew not whither. Listlessly he turned the pages of the paper. Suddenly he gave a great start, and an exclamation once more was forced from his lips. His eyes had fallen on a small paragraph near the bottom of a column. Sudden Death of an M.P., he read. Mr. Owen Griffiths, member for so-and-so, had been taken ill in Fleet Street that afternoon and when he was brought to Charing Cross Hospital life was found to be extinct. It was supposed that death was due to natural causes, but an inquest would be held. Dr Audlin could hardly believe his eyes. Was it possible that the night before Lord Mountdrago had at last in his dream found himself possessed of the weapon, knife or gun, that he had wanted, and had killed his tormentor, and had that ghostly murder, in the same way as the blow with the bottle had given him a racking headache on the following day, taken effect a certain number of hours later on the waking man? Or was it, more mysterious and more frightful, that when Lord Mountdrago sought relief in death, the enemy he had so cruelly wronged, unappeased, escaping from his own mortality, had pursued him to some other sphere there to torment him still? It was strange. The sensible thing was to look upon it merely as an odd coincidence. Dr Audlin rang the bell.

"Tell Mrs. Milton that I'm sorry I can't see her this evening. I'm not well."

It was true; he shivered as though of an ague. With some kind of spiritual sense he seemed to envisage a bleak, a horrible void. The dark night of the soul engulfed him, and he felt a strange, primeval terror of he knew not what.





The Letter


Outside on the quay the sun beat fiercely. A stream of motors, lorries and buses, private cars and hirelings, sped up and down the crowded thoroughfare, and every chauffeur blew his horn; rickshaws threaded their nimble path amid the throng, and the panting coolies found breath to yell at one another; coolies, carrying heavy bales, sidled along with their quick jog-trot and shouted to the passer-by to make way; itinerant vendors proclaimed their wares. Singapore is the meeting-place of a hundred peoples; and men of all colours, black Tamils, yellow Chinks, brown Malays, Armenians, Jews, and Bengalis, called to one another in raucous tones. But inside the office of Messrs Ripley, Joyce, and Naylor it was pleasantly cool; it was dark after the dusty glitter of the street and agreeably quiet after its unceasing din. Mr. Joyce sat in his private room, at the table, with an electric fan turned full on him. He was leaning back, his elbows on the arms of the chair, with the tips of the outstretched fingers of one hand resting neatly against the tips of the outstretched fingers of the other. His gaze rested on the battered volumes of the Law Reports which stood on a long shelf in front of him. On the top of a cupboard were square boxes of japanned tin, on which were painted the names of various clients.

There was a knock at the door.

"Come in."

A Chinese clerk, very neat in his white ducks, opened it.

"Mr. Crosbie is here, sir."

He spoke beautiful English, accenting each word with precision, and Mr. Joyce had often wondered at the extent of his vocabulary. Ong Chi Seng was a Cantonese, and he had studied law at Gray's Inn. He was spending a year or two with Messrs Ripley, Joyce, and Naylor in order to prepare himself for practice on his own account. He was industrious, obliging, and of exemplary character.

"Show him in," said Mr. Joyce.

He rose to shake hands with his visitor and asked him to sit down. The light fell on him as he did so. The face of Mr. Joyce remained in shadow. He was by nature a silent man, and now he looked at Robert Crosbie for quite a minute without speaking. Crosbie was a big fellow, well over six feet high, with broad shoulders, and muscular. He was a rubber-planter, hard with the constant exercise of walking over the estate, and with the tennis which was his relaxation when the day's work was over. He was deeply sunburned. His hairy hands, his feet in clumsy boots were enormous, and Mr. Joyce found himself thinking that a blow of that great fist could easily kill the fragile Tamil. But there was no fierceness in his blue eyes; they were confiding and gentle; and his face, with its big, undistinguished features, was open, frank, and honest. But at this moment it bore a look of deep distress. It was drawn and haggard.

"You look as though you hadn't had much sleep the last night or two," said Mr. Joyce.

"I haven't."

Mr. Joyce noticed now the old felt hat, with its broad double brim, which Crosbie had placed on the table; and then his eyes travelled to the khaki shorts he wore, showing his red hairy thighs, the tennis shirt open at the neck, without a tie, and the dirty khaki jacket with the ends of the sleeves turned up. He looked as though he had just come in from a long tramp among the rubber trees. Mr. Joyce gave a slight frown.

"You must pull yourself together, you know. You must keep your head."

"Oh, I'm all right."

"Have you seen your wife today?"

"No, I'm to see her this afternoon. You know, it is a damned shame that they should have arrested her."

"I think they had to do that," Mr. Joyce answered in his level, soft tone.

"I should have thought they'd have let her out on bail."

"It's a very serious charge."

"It is damnable. She did what any decent woman would do in her place. Only, nine women out of ten wouldn't have the pluck. Leslie's the best woman in the world. She wouldn't hurt a fly. Why, hang it all, man, I've been married to her for twelve years, do you think I don't know her? God, if I'd got hold of the man I'd have wrung his neck, I'd have killed him without a moment's hesitation. So would you."

"My dear fellow, everybody's on your side. No one has a good word to say for Hammond. We're going to get her off. I don't suppose either the assessors or the judge will go into court without having already made up their minds to bring in a verdict of not guilty."

"The whole thing's a farce," said Crosbie violently. "She ought never to have been arrested in the first place, and then it's terrible, after all the poor girl's gone through, to subject her to the ordeal of a trial. There's not a soul I've met since I've been in Singapore, man or woman, who hasn't told me that Leslie was absolutely justified. I think it's awful to keep her in prison all these weeks."

"The law is the law. After all, she confesses that she killed the man. It is terrible, and I'm dreadfully sorry for both you and her."

"I don't matter a hang," interrupted Crosbie.

"But the fact remains that murder has been committed, and in a civilized community a trial is inevitable."

"Is it murder to exterminate noxious vermin? She shot him as she would have shot a mad dog."

Mr. Joyce leaned back again in his chair and once more placed the tips of his ten fingers together. The little construction he formed looked like the skeleton of a roof. He was silent for a moment.

"I should be wanting in my duty as your legal adviser," he said at last, in an even voice, looking at his client with his cool, brown eyes, "if I did not tell you that there is one point which causes me just a little anxiety. If your wife had only shot Hammond once, the whole thing would be absolutely plain sailing. Unfortunately she fired six times."

"Her explanation is perfectly simple. In the circumstances anyone would have done the same."

"I dare say," said Mr. Joyce, "and of course I think the explanation is very reasonable. But it's no good closing our eyes to the facts. It's always a good plan to put yourself in another man's place, and I can't deny that if I were prosecuting for the Crown that is the point on which I should centre my inquiry."

"My dear fellow, that's perfectly idiotic."

Mr. Joyce shot a sharp glance at Robert Crosbie. The shadow of a smile hovered over his shapely lips. Crosbie was a good fellow, but he could hardly be described as intelligent.

"I dare say it's of no importance," answered the lawyer, "I just thought it was a point worth mentioning. You haven't got very long to wait now, and when it's all over I recommend you to go off somewhere with your wife on a trip, and forget all about it. Even though we are almost dead certain to get an acquittal, a trial of that sort is anxious work, and you'll both want a rest."

For the first time Crosbie smiled, and his smile strangely changed his face. You forgot the uncouthness and saw only the goodness of his soul.

"I think I shall want it more than Leslie. She's borne up wonderfully. By God, there's a plucky little woman for you."

"Yes, I've been very much struck by her self-control," said the lawyer. "I should never have guessed that she was capable of such determination."

His duties as her counsel had made it necessary for him to have a good many interviews with Mrs. Crosbie since her arrest. Though things had been made as easy as could be for her, the fact remained that she was in gaol, awaiting her trial for murder, and it would not have been surprising if her nerves had failed her. She appeared to bear her ordeal with composure. She read a great deal, took such exercise as was possible, and by favour of the authorities worked at the pillow lace which had always formed the entertainment of her long hours of leisure. When Mr. Joyce saw her, she was neatly dressed in cool, fresh, simple frocks, her hair was carefully arranged, and her nails were manicured. Her manner was collected. She was able even to jest upon the little inconveniences of her position. There was something casual about the way in which she spoke of the tragedy, which suggested to Mr. Joyce that only her good breeding prevented her from finding something a trifle ludicrous in a situation which was eminently serious. It surprised him, for he had never thought that she had a sense of humour.

He had known her off and on for a good many years. When she paid visits to Singapore she generally came to dine with his wife and himself, and once or twice she had passed a weekend with them at their bungalow by the sea. His wife had spent a fortnight with her on the estate, and had met Geoffrey Hammond several times. The two couples had been on friendly, if not on intimate, terms, and it was on this account that Robert Crosbie had rushed over to Singapore immediately after the catastrophe and begged Mr. Joyce to take charge personally of his unhappy wife's defence.

The story she told him the first time he saw her she had never varied in the smallest detail. She told it as coolly then, a few hours after the tragedy, as she told it now. She told it connectedly, in a level, even voice, and her only sign of confusion was when a slight colour came into her cheeks as she described one or two of its incidents. She was the last woman to whom one would have expected such a thing to happen. She was in the early thirties, a fragile creature, neither short nor tall, and graceful rather than pretty. Her wrists and ankles were very delicate, but she was extremely thin, and you could see the bones of her hands through the white skin, and the veins were large and blue. Her face was colourless, slightly sallow, and her lips were pale. You did not notice the colour of her eyes. She had a great deal of light brown hair, and it had a slight natural wave; it was the sort of hair that with a little touching-up would have been very pretty, but you could not imagine that Mrs. Crosbie would think of resorting to any such device. She was a quiet, pleasant, unassuming woman. Her manner was engaging, and if she was not very popular it was because she suffered from a certain shyness. This was comprehensible enough, for the planter's life is lonely, and in her own house, with people she knew, she was in her quiet way charming. Mrs. Joyce, after her fortnight's stay, had told her husband that Leslie was a very agreeable hostess. There was more in her, she said, than people thought; and when you came to know her you were surprised how much she had read and how entertaining she could be.

She was the last woman in the world to commit murder.

Mr. Joyce dismissed Robert Crosbie with such reassuring words as he could find and, once more alone in his office, turned over the pages of the brief. But it was a mechanical action, for all its details were familiar to him. The case was the sensation of the day, and it was discussed in all the clubs, at all the dinner tables, up and down the Peninsula, from Singapore to Penang. The facts that Mrs. Crosbie gave were simple. Her husband had gone to Singapore on business, and she was alone for the night. She dined by herself, late, at a quarter to nine, and after dinner sat in the sitting-room working at her lace. It opened on the veranda. There was no one in the bungalow, for the servants had retired to their own quarters at the back of the compound. She was surprised to hear a step on the gravel path in the garden, a booted step, which suggested a white man rather than a native, for she had not heard a motor drive up, and she could not imagine who could be coming to see her at that time of night. Someone ascended the few stairs that led up to the bungalow, walked across the veranda, and appeared at the door of the room in which she sat. At the first moment she did not recognize the visitor. She sat with a shaded lamp, and he stood with his back to the darkness.

"May I come in?" he said.

She did not even recognize the voice.

"Who is it?" she asked.

She worked with spectacles, and she took them off as she spoke.

"Geoff Hammond."

"Of course. Come in and have a drink."

She rose and shook hands with him cordially. She was a little surprised to see him, for though he was a neighbour neither she nor Robert had been lately on very intimate terms with him, and she had not seen him for some weeks. He was the manager of a rubber estate nearly eight miles from theirs, and she wondered why he had chosen this late hour to come and see them.

"Robert's away," she said. "He had to go to Singapore for the night."

Perhaps he thought his visit called for some explanation, for he said:

"I'm sorry. I felt rather lonely tonight, so I thought I'd just come along and see how you were getting on."

"How on earth did you come? I never heard a car."

"I left it down the road. I thought you might both be in bed and asleep."

This was natural enough. The planter gets up at dawn in order to take the roll-call of the workers, and soon after dinner he is glad to go to bed. Hammond's car was in point of fact found next day a quarter of a mile from the bungalow.

Since Robert was away there was no whisky and soda in the room. Leslie did not call the boy, who was probably asleep, but fetched it herself. Her guest mixed himself a drink and filled his pipe.

Geoff Hammond had a host of friends in the colony. He was at this time in the late thirties, but he had come out as a lad. He had been one of the first to volunteer on the outbreak of war, and had done very well. A wound in the knee caused him to be invalided out of the army after two years, but he returned to the Federated Malay States with a D.S.O. and an M.C. He was one of the best billiard-players in the colony. He had been a beautiful dancer and a fine tennis-player, but though able no longer to dance, and his tennis, with a stiff knee, was not so good as it had been, he had the gift of popularity and was universally liked. He was a tall, good-looking fellow, with attractive blue eyes and a fine head of black, curling hair. Old stagers said his only fault was that he was too fond of the girls, and after the catastrophe they shook their heads and vowed that they had always known this would get him into trouble.

He began now to talk to Leslie about the local affairs, the forthcoming races in Singapore, the price of rubber, and his chances of killing a tiger which had been lately seen in the neighbourhood. She was anxious to finish by a certain date a piece of lace on which she was working, for she wanted to send it home for her mother's birthday, and so put on her spectacles again, and drew towards her chair the little table on which stood the pillow.

"I wish you wouldn't wear those great horn-spectacles," he said. "I don't know why a pretty woman should do her best to look plain."

She was a trifle taken aback at this remark. He had never used that tone with her before. She thought the best thing was to make light of it.

"I have no pretensions to being a raving beauty, you know, and if you ask me point-blank, I'm bound to tell you that I don't care two pins if you think me plain or not."

"I don't think you're plain. I think you're awfully pretty."

"Sweet of you," she answered, ironically. "But in that case I can only think you half-witted."

He chuckled. But he rose from his chair and sat down in another by her side.

"You're not going to have the face to deny that you have the prettiest hands in the world," he said.

He made a gesture as though to take one of them. She gave him a little tap.

"Don't be an idiot. Sit down where you were before and talk sensibly, or else I shall send you home."

He did not move.

"Don't you know that I'm awfully in love with you?" he said.

She remained quite cool.

"I don't. I don't believe it for a minute, and even if it were true I don't want you to say it."

She was the more surprised at what he was saying, since during the seven years she had known him he had never paid her any particular attention. When he came back from the war they had seen a good deal of one another, and once when he was ill Robert had gone over and brought him back to their bungalow in his car. He had stayed with them for a fortnight. But their interests were dissimilar, and the acquaintance had never ripened into friendship. For the last two or three years they had seen little of him. Now and then he came over to play tennis, now and then they met him at some planter's who was giving a party, but it often happened that they did not set eyes on him for a month at a time.

Now he took another whisky and soda. Leslie wondered if he had been drinking before. There was something odd about him, and it made her a trifle uneasy. She watched him help himself with disapproval.

"I wouldn't drink any more if I were you," she said, good-humouredly still.

He emptied his glass and put it down.

"Do you think I'm talking to you like this because I'm drunk?" he asked abruptly.

"That is the most obvious explanation, isn't it?"

"Well, it's a lie. I've loved you ever since I first knew you. I've held my tongue as long as I could, and now it's got to come out. I love you, I love you, I love you."

She rose and carefully put aside the pillow.

"Good night," she said.

"I'm not going now."

At last she began to lose her temper.

"But, you poor fool, don't you know that I've never loved anyone but Robert, and even if I didn't love Robert you're the last man I should care for."

"What do I care? Robert's away."

"If you don't go away this minute I shall call the boys, and have you thrown out."

"They're out of earshot."

She was very angry now. She made a movement as though to go on to the veranda, from which the house-boy would certainly hear her, but he seized her arm.

"Let me go," she cried furiously.

"Not much. I've got you now."

She opened her mouth and called "Boy, boy," but with a quick gesture he put his hand over it. Then before she knew what he was about he had taken her in his arms and was kissing her passionately. She struggled, turning her lips away from his burning mouth.

"No, no, no," she cried. "Leave me alone. I won't."

She grew confused about what happened then. All that had been said before she remembered accurately, but now his words assailed her ears through a mist of horror and fear. He seemed to plead for her love. He broke into violent protestations of passion. And all the time he held her in his tempestuous embrace. She was helpless, for he was a strong, powerful man, and her arms were pinioned to her sides; her struggles were unavailing, and she felt herself grow weaker; she was afraid she would faint, and his hot breath on her face made her feel desperately sick. He kissed her mouth, her eyes, her cheeks, her hair. The pressure of his arms was killing her. He lifted her off her feet. She tried to kick him, but he only held her more closely. He was carrying her now. He wasn't speaking any more, but she knew that his face was pale and his eyes hot with desire. He was taking her into the bedroom. He was no longer a civilized man, but a savage. And as he ran he stumbled against a table which was in the way. His stiff knee made him a little awkward on his feet, and with the burden of the woman in his arms he fell. In a moment she had snatched herself away from him. She ran round the sofa. He was up in a flash, and flung himself towards her. There was a revolver on the desk. She was not a nervous woman, but Robert was to be away for the night, and she had meant to take it into her room when she went to bed. That was why it happened to be there. She was frantic with terror now. She did not know what she was doing. She heard a report. She saw Hammond stagger. He gave a cry. He said something, she didn't know what. He lurched out of the room on to the veranda. She was in a frenzy now, she was beside herself, she followed him out, yes, that was it, she must have followed him out, though she remembered nothing of it, she followed firing automatically, shot after shot, till the six chambers were empty. Hammond fell down on the floor of the veranda. He crumpled up into a bloody heap.

When the boys, startled by the reports, rushed up, they found her standing over Hammond with the revolver still in her hand and Hammond lifeless. She looked at them for a moment without speaking. They stood in a frightened, huddled bunch. She let the revolver fall from her hand, and without a word turned and went into the sitting-room. They watched her go into her bedroom and turn the key in the lock. They dared not touch the dead body, but looked at it with terrified eyes, talking excitedly to one another in undertones. Then the head-boy collected himself; he had been with them for many years, he was Chinese and a level-headed fellow. Robert had gone into Singapore on his motor-cycle, and the car stood in the garage. He told the seis to get it out; they must go at once to the Assistant District Officer and tell him what had happened. He picked up the revolver and put it in his pocket. The A.D.O., a man called Withers, lived on the outskirts of the nearest town, which was about thirty-five miles away. It took them an hour and a half to reach him. Everyone was asleep, and they had to rouse the boys. Presently Withers came out and they told him their errand. The head-boy showed him the revolver in proof of what he said. The A.D.O. went into his room to dress, sent for his car, and in a little while was following them back along the deserted road. The dawn was just breaking as he reached the Crosbies' bungalow. He ran up the steps of the veranda, and stopped short as he saw Hammond's body lying where he fell. He touched the face. It was quite cold.

"Where's mem?" he asked the house-boy.

The Chinese pointed to the bedroom. Withers went to the door and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again.

"Mrs. Crosbie," he called.

"Who is it?"

"Withers."

There was another pause. Then the door was unlocked and slowly opened. Leslie stood before him. She had not been to bed, and wore the tea-gown in which she had dined. She stood and looked silently at the A.D.O.

"Your house-boy fetched me," he said. "Hammond. What have you done?"

"He tried to rape me, and I shot him."

"My God. I say, you'd better come out here. You must tell me exactly what happened."

"Not now. I can't. You must give me time. Send for my husband."

Withers was a young man, and he did not know exactly what to do in an emergency which was so out of the run of his duties. Leslie refused to say anything till at last Robert arrived. Then she told the two men the story, from which since then, though she had repeated it over and over again, she had never in the slightest degree diverged.

The point to which Mr. Joyce recurred was the shooting. As a lawyer he was bothered that Leslie had fired not once, but six times, and the examination of the dead man showed that four of the shots had been fired close to the body. One might almost have thought that when the man fell she stood over him and emptied the contents of the revolver into him. She confessed that her memory, so accurate for all that had preceded, failed her here. Her mind was blank. It pointed to an uncontrollable fury; but uncontrollable fury was the last thing you would have expected from this quiet and demure woman. Mr. Joyce had known her a good many years, and had always thought her an unemotional person; during the weeks that had passed since the tragedy her composure had been amazing.

Mr. Joyce shrugged his shoulders.

"The fact is, I suppose," he reflected, "that you can never tell what hidden possibilities of savagery there are in the most respectable of women."

There was a knock at the door.

"Come in."

The Chinese clerk entered and closed the door behind him. He closed it gently, with deliberation, but decidedly, and advanced to the table at which Mr. Joyce was sitting.

"May I trouble you, sir, for a few words' private conversation?" he said.

The elaborate accuracy with which the clerk expressed himself always faintly amused Mr. Joyce, and now he smiled.

"It's no trouble, Chi Seng," he replied.

"The matter on which I desire to speak to you, sir, is delicate and confidential."

"Fire away."

Mr. Joyce met his clerk's shrewd eyes. As usual Ong Chi Seng was dressed in the height of local fashion. He wore very shiny patent-leather shoes and gay silk socks. In his black tie was a pearl and ruby pin, and on the fourth finger of his left hand a diamond ring. From the pocket of his neat white coat protruded a gold fountain pen and a gold pencil. He wore a gold wrist-watch, and on the bridge of his nose invisible pince-nez. He gave a little cough.

"The matter has to do with the case R. V. Crosbie, sir."

"Yes?"

"A circumstance has come to my knowledge, sir, which seems to me to put a different complexion on it."

"What circumstance?"

"It has come to my knowledge, sir, that there is a letter in existence from the defendant to the unfortunate victim of the tragedy."

"I shouldn't be at all surprised. In the course of the last seven years I have no doubt that Mrs. Crosbie often had occasion to write to Mr. Hammond."

Mr. Joyce had a high opinion of his clerk's intelligence and his words were designed to conceal his thoughts.

"That is very probable, sir. Mrs. Crosbie must have communicated with the deceased frequently, to invite him to dine with her for example, or to propose a tennis game. That was my first thought when the matter was brought to my notice. This letter, however, was written on the day of the late Mr. Hammond's death."

Mr. Joyce did not flicker an eyelash. He continued to look at Ong Chi Seng with the smile of faint amusement with which he generally talked to him.

"Who has told you this?"

"The circumstances were brought to my knowledge, sir, by a friend of mine."

Mr. Joyce knew better than to insist.

"You will no doubt recall, sir, that Mrs. Crosbie has stated that until the fatal night she had had no communication with the deceased for several weeks."

"Have you got the letter?"

"No, sir."

"What are its contents?"

"My friend gave me a copy. Would you like to peruse it, sir?"

"I should."

Ong Chi Seng took from an inside pocket a bulky wallet. It was filled with papers, Singapore dollar notes and cigarette cards. From the confusion he presently extracted a half-sheet of thin notepaper and placed it before Mr. Joyce. The letter read as follows:





R. will be away for the night. I absolutely must see you. I shall expect you at eleven. I am desperate, and if you don't come I won't answer for the consequences. Don't drive up.—L.





It was written in the flowing hand which the Chinese were taught at the foreign schools. The writing, so lacking in character, was oddly incongruous with the ominous words.

"What makes you think that this note was written by Mrs. Crosbie?"

"I have every confidence in the veracity of my informant, sir," replied Ong Chi Seng. "And the matter can very easily be put to the proof. Mrs. Crosbie will, no doubt, be able to tell you at once whether she wrote such a letter or not."

Since the beginning of the conversation Mr. Joyce had not taken his eyes off the respectable countenance of his clerk. He wondered now if he discerned in it a faint expression of mockery.

"It is inconceivable that Mrs. Crosbie should have written such a letter," said Mr. Joyce.

"If that is your opinion, sir, the matter is of course ended. My friend spoke to me on the subject only because he thought, as I was in your office, you might like to know of the existence of this letter before a communication was made to the Deputy Public Prosecutor."

"Who has the original?" asked Mr. Joyce sharply.

Ong Chi Seng made no sign that he perceived in this question and its manner a change of attitude.

"You will remember, sir, no doubt, that after the death of Mr. Hammond it was discovered that he had had relations with a Chinese woman. The letter is at present in her possession."

That was one of the things which had turned public opinion most vehemently against Hammond. It came to be known that for several months he had had a Chinese woman living in his house.

For a moment neither of them spoke. Indeed everything had been said and each understood the other perfectly.

"I'm obliged to you, Chi Seng. I will give the matter my consideration."

"Very good, sir. Do you wish me to make a communication to that effect to my friend?"

"I dare say it would be as well if you kept in touch with him," Mr. Joyce answered with gravity.

"Yes, sir."

The clerk noiselessly left the room, shutting the door again with deliberation, and left Mr. Joyce to his reflections. He stared at the copy, in its neat, impersonal writing, of Leslie's letter. Vague suspicions troubled him. They were so disconcerting that he made an effort to put them out of his mind. There must be a simple explanation of the letter, and Leslie without doubt could give it at once, but, by heaven, an explanation was needed. He rose from his chair, put the letter in his pocket, and took his topee. When he went out Ong Chi Seng was busily writing at his desk.

"I'm going out for a few minutes, Chi Seng," he said.

"Mr. George Reed is coming by appointment at twelve o'clock, sir. Where shall I say you've gone?"

Mr. Joyce gave him a thin smile.

"You can say that you haven't the least idea."

But he knew perfectly well that Ong Chi Seng was aware that he was going to the gaol. Though the crime had been committed in Belanda and the trial was to take place at Belanda Bharu, since there was in the gaol no convenience for the detention of a white woman Mrs. Crosbie had been brought to Singapore.

When she was led into the room in which he waited she held out her thin, distinguished hand, and gave him a pleasant smile. She was as ever neatly and simply dressed, and her abundant, pale hair was arranged with care.

"I wasn't expecting to see you this morning," she said, graciously.

She might have been in her own house, and Mr. Joyce almost expected to hear her call the boy and tell him to bring the visitor a gin pahit.

"How are you?" he asked.

"I'm in the best of health, thank you." A flicker of amusement flashed across her eyes. "This is a wonderful place for a rest cure."

The attendant withdrew and they were left alone.

"Do sit down," said Leslie.

He took a chair. He did not quite know how to begin. She was so cool that it seemed almost impossible to say to her the thing he had come to say. Though she was not pretty there was something agreeable in her appearance. She had elegance, but it was the elegance of good breeding in which there was nothing of the artifice of society. You had only to look at her to know what sort of people she had and what kind of surroundings she had lived in. Her fragility gave her a singular refinement. It was impossible to associate her with the vaguest idea of grossness.

"I'm looking forward to seeing Robert this afternoon," she said, in her good-humoured, easy voice. (It was a pleasure to hear her speak, her voice and her accent were so distinctive of her class.) "Poor dear, it's been a great trial to his nerves. I'm thankful it'll all be over in a few days."

"It's only five days now."

"I know. Each morning when I awake I say to myself, 'one less.'" She smiled then. "Just as I used to do at school and the holidays were coming."

"By the way, am I right in thinking that you had no communication whatever with Hammond for several weeks before the catastrophe?"

"I'm quite positive of that. The last time we met was at a tennis-party at the MacFarrens. I don't think I said more than two words to him. They have two courts, you know, and we didn't happen to be in the same sets."

"And you haven't written to him?"

"Oh, no."

"Are you quite sure of that?"

"Oh, quite," she answered, with a little smile. "There was nothing I should write to him for except to ask him to dine or to play tennis, and I hadn't done either for months."

"At one time you'd been on fairly intimate terms with him. How did it happen that you had stopped asking him to anything?"

Mrs. Crosbie shrugged her thin shoulders.

"One gets tired of people. We hadn't anything very much in common. Of course, when he was ill Robert and I did everything we could for him, but the last year or two he'd been quite well, and he was very popular. He had a good many calls on his time, and there didn't seem to be any need to shower invitations upon him."

"Are you quite certain that was all?"

Mrs. Crosbie hesitated for a moment.

"Well, I may just as well tell you. It had come to our ears that he was living with a Chinese woman, and Robert said he wouldn't have him in the house. I had seen her myself."

Mr. Joyce was sitting in a straight-backed arm-chair, resting his chin on his hand, and his eyes were fixed on Leslie. Was it his fancy that, as she made this remark, her black pupils were filled on a sudden, for the fraction of a second, with a dull red light? The effect was startling. Mr. Joyce shifted in his chair. He placed the tips of his ten fingers together. He spoke very slowly, choosing his words.

"I think I should tell you that there is in existence a letter in your handwriting to Geoff Hammond."

He watched her closely. She made no movement, nor did her face change colour, but she took a noticeable time to reply.

"In the past I've often sent him little notes to ask him to something or other, or to get me something when I knew he was going to Singapore."

"This letter asks him to come and see you because Robert was going to Singapore."

"That's impossible. I never did anything of the kind."

"You'd better read it for yourself."

He took it out of his pocket and handed it to her. She gave it a glance and with a smile of scorn handed it back to him.

"That's not my handwriting."

"I know, it's said to be an exact copy of the original."

She read the words now, and as she read a horrible change came over her. Her colourless face grew dreadful to look at. It turned green. The flesh seemed on a sudden to fall away and her skin was tightly stretched over the bones. Her lips receded, showing her teeth, so that she had the appearance of making a grimace. She stared at Mr. Joyce with eyes that started from their sockets. He was looking now at a gibbering death's head.

"What does it mean?" she whispered.

Her mouth was so dry that she could utter no more than a hoarse sound. It was no longer a human voice.

"That is for you to say," he answered.

"I didn't write it. I swear I didn't write it."

"Be very careful what you say. If the original is in your handwriting it would be useless to deny it."

"It would be a forgery."

"It would be difficult to prove that. It would be easy to prove that it was genuine."

A shiver passed through her lean body. But great beads of sweat stood on her forehead. She took a handkerchief from her bag and wiped the palms of her hands. She glanced at the letter again and gave Mr. Joyce a sidelong look.

"It's not dated. If I had written it and forgotten all about it, it might have been written years ago. If you'll give me time, I'll try and remember the circumstances."

"I noticed there was no date. If this letter were in the hands of the prosecution they would cross-examine the boys. They would soon find out whether someone took a letter to Hammond on the day of his death."

Mrs. Crosbie clasped her hands violently and swayed in her chair so that he thought she would faint.

"I swear to you that I didn't write that letter."

Mr. Joyce was silent for a little while. He took his eyes from her distraught face, and looked down on the floor. He was reflecting.

"In these circumstances we need not go into the matter further," he said slowly, at last breaking the silence. "If the possessor of this letter sees fit to place it in the hands of the prosecution you will be prepared."

His words suggested that he had nothing more to say to her, but he made no movement of departure. He waited. To himself he seemed to wait a very long time. He did not look at Leslie, but he was conscious that she sat very still. She made no sound. At last it was he who spoke.

"If you have nothing more to say to me I think I'll be getting back to my office."

"What would anyone who read the letter be inclined to think that it meant?" she asked then.

"He'd know that you had told a deliberate lie," answered Mr. Joyce sharply.

"When?"

"You have stated definitely that you had had no communication with Hammond for at least three months."

"The whole thing has been a terrible shock to me. The events of that dreadful night have been a nightmare. It's not very strange if one detail has escaped my memory."

"It would be unfortunate, when your memory has reproduced so exactly every particular of your interview with Hammond, that you should have forgotten so important a point as that he came to see you in the bungalow on the night of his death at your express desire."

"I hadn't forgotten. After what happened I was afraid to mention it. I thought you'd none of you believe my story if I admitted that he'd come at my invitation. I dare say it was stupid of me; but I lost my head, and after I'd said once that I'd had no communication with Hammond I was obliged to stick to it."

By now Leslie had recovered her admirable composure, and she met Mr. Joyce's appraising glance with candour. Her gentleness was very disarming.

"You will be required to explain, then, why you asked Hammond to come and see you when Robert was away for the night."

She turned her eyes full on the lawyer. He had been mistaken in thinking them insignificant, they were rather fine eyes, and unless he was mistaken they were bright now with tears. Her voice had a little break in it.

"It was a surprise I was preparing for Robert. His birthday is next month. I knew he wanted a new gun and you know I'm dreadfully stupid about sporting things. I wanted to talk to Geoff about it. I thought I'd get him to order it for me."

"Perhaps the terms of the letter are not very clear to your recollection. Will you have another look at it?"

"No, I don't want to," she said quickly.

"Does it seem to you the sort of letter a woman would write to a somewhat distant acquaintance because she wanted to consult him about buying a gun?"

"I dare say it's rather extravagant and emotional. I do express myself like that, you know. I'm quite prepared to admit it's very silly." She smiled. "And after all, Geoff Hammond wasn't quite a distant acquaintance. When he was ill I'd nursed him like a mother. I asked him to come when Robert was away, because Robert wouldn't have him in the house."

Mr. Joyce was tired of sitting so long in the same position. He rose and walked once or twice up and down the room, choosing the words he proposed to say; then he leaned over the back of the chair in which he had been sitting. He spoke slowly in a tone of deep gravity.

"Mrs. Crosbie, I want to talk to you very, very seriously. This case was comparatively plain sailing. There was only one point which seemed to me to require explanation: as far as I could judge, you had fired no less than four shots into Hammond when he was lying on the ground. It was hard to accept the possibility that a delicate, frightened, and habitually self-controlled woman, of gentle nature and refined instincts, should have surrendered to an absolutely uncontrolled frenzy. But of course it was admissible. Although Geoffrey Hammond was much liked and on the whole thought highly of, I was prepared to prove that he was the sort of man who might be guilty of the crime which in justification of your act you accused him of. The fact, which was discovered after his death, that he had been living with a Chinese woman gave us something very definite to go upon. That robbed him of any sympathy which might have been felt for him. We made up our minds to make use of the odium which such a connexion cast upon him in the minds of all respectable people. I told your husband this morning that I was certain of an acquittal, and I wasn't just telling him that to give him heart. I do not believe the assessors would have left the court."

They looked into one another's eyes. Mrs. Crosbie was strangely still. She was like a little bird paralysed by the fascination of a snake. He went on in the same quiet tones.

"But this letter has thrown an entirely different complexion on the case. I am your legal adviser, I shall represent you in court. I take your story as you tell it me, and I shall conduct your defence according to its terms. It may be that I believe your statements, and it may be that I doubt them. The duty of counsel is to persuade the court that the evidence placed before it is not such as to justify it in bringing in a verdict of guilty, and any private opinion he may have of the guilt or innocence of his client is entirely beside the point."

He was astonished to see in Leslie's eyes the flicker of a smile. Piqued, he went on somewhat dryly:

"You're not going to deny that Hammond came to your house at your urgent, and I may even say, hysterical invitation?"

Mrs. Crosbie, hesitating for an instant, seemed to consider.

"They can prove that the letter was taken to his bungalow by one of the house-boys. He rode over on his bicycle."

"You mustn't expect other people to be stupider than you. The letter will put them on the track of suspicions which have entered nobody's head. I will not tell you what I personally thought when I saw the copy. I do not wish you to tell me anything but what is needed to save your neck."

Mrs. Crosbie gave a shrill cry. She sprang to her feet, white with terror.

"You don't think they'd hang me?"

"If they came to the conclusion that you hadn't killed Hammond in self-defence, it would be the duty of the assessors to bring in a verdict of guilty. The charge is murder. It would be the duty of the judge to sentence you to death."

"But what can they prove?" she gasped.

"I don't know what they can prove. You know. I don't want to know. But if their suspicions are aroused, if they begin to make inquiries, if the natives are questioned—what is it that can be discovered?"

She crumpled up suddenly. She fell on the floor before he could catch her. She had fainted. He looked round the room for water, but there was none there, and he did not want to be disturbed. He stretched her out on the floor, and kneeling beside her waited for her to recover. When she opened her eyes he was disconcerted by the ghastly fear that he saw in them.

"Keep quite still," he said. "You'll be better in a moment."

"You won't let them hang me," she whispered.

She began to cry, hysterically, while in undertones he sought to quieten her.

"For goodness sake pull yourself together," he said.

"Give me a minute."

Her courage was amazing. He could see the effort she made to regain her self-control, and soon she was once more calm.

"Let me get up now."

He gave her his hand and helped her to her feet. Taking her arm, he led her to the chair. She sat down wearily.

"Don't talk to me for a minute or two," she said.

"Very well."

When at last she spoke it was to say something which he did not expect. She gave a little sigh.

"I'm afraid I've made rather a mess of things," she said.

He did not answer, and once more there was a silence.

"Isn't it possible to get hold of the letter?" she said at last.

"I do not think anything would have been said to me about it if the person in whose possession it is was not prepared to sell it."

"Who's got it?"

"The Chinese woman who was living in Hammond's house."

A spot of colour flickered for an instant on Leslie's cheek-bones.

"Does she want an awful lot for it?"

"I imagine that she has a very shrewd idea of its value. I doubt if it would be possible to get hold of it except for a very large sum."

"Are you going to let me be hanged?"

"Do you think it's so simple as all that to secure possession of an unwelcome piece of evidence? It's no different from suborning a witness. You have no right to make any such suggestion to me."

"Then what is going to happen to me?"

"Justice must take its course."

She grew very pale. A little shudder passed through her body.

"I put myself in your hands. Of course I have no right to ask you to do anything that isn't proper."

Mr. Joyce had not bargained for the little break in her voice which her habitual self-restraint made quite intolerably moving. She looked at him with humble eyes, and he thought that if he rejected their appeal they would haunt him for the rest of his life. After all, nothing could bring poor Hammond back to life again. He wondered what really was the explanation of that letter. It was not fair to conclude from it that she had killed Hammond without provocation. He had lived in the East a long time and his sense of professional honour was not perhaps so acute as it had been twenty years before. He stared at the floor. He made up his mind to do something which he knew was unjustifiable, but it stuck in his throat and he felt dully resentful towards Leslie. It embarrassed him a little to speak.

"I don't know exactly what your husband's circumstances are?"

Flushing a rosy red, she shot a swift glance at him.

"He has a good many tin shares and a small share in two or three rubber estates. I suppose he could raise money."

"He would have to be told what it was for."

She was silent for a moment. She seemed to think.

"He's in love with me still. He would make any sacrifice to save me. Is there any need for him to see the letter?"

Mr. Joyce frowned a little, and, quick to notice, she went on.

"Robert is an old friend of yours. I'm not asking you to do anything for me, I'm asking you to save a rather simple, kind man who never did you any harm from all the pain that's possible."

Mr. Joyce did not reply. He rose to go and Mrs. Crosbie, with the grace that was natural to her, held out her hand. She was shaken by the scene, and her look was haggard, but she made a brave attempt to speed him with courtesy.

"It's so good of you to take all this trouble for me. I can't begin to tell you how grateful I am."

Mr. Joyce returned to his office. He sat in his own room, quite still, attempting to do no work, and pondered. His imagination brought him many strange ideas. He shuddered a little. At last there was the discreet knock on the door which he was expecting. Ong Chi Seng came in.

"I was just going out to have my tiffin, sir," he said.

"All right."

"I didn't know if there was anything you wanted before I went, sir."

"I don't think so. Did you make another appointment for Mr. Reed?"

"Yes, sir. He will come at three o'clock."

"Good."

Ong Chi Seng turned away, walked to the door, and put his long slim fingers on the handle. Then, as though on an afterthought, he turned back.

"Is there anything you wish me to say to my friend, sir?"

Although Ong Chi Seng spoke English so admirably he had still a difficulty with the letter R, and he pronounced it "fliend".

"What friend?"

"About the letter Mrs. Crosbie wrote to Hammond deceased, sir."

"Oh! I'd forgotten about that. I mentioned it to Mrs. Crosbie and she denies having written anything of the sort. It's evidently a forgery."

Mr. Joyce took the copy from his pocket and handed it to Ong Chi Seng. Ong Chi Seng ignored the gesture.

"In that case, sir, I suppose there would be no objection if my fliend delivered the letter to the Deputy Public Prosecutor."

"None. But I don't quite see what good that would do your friend."

"My fliend, sir, thought it was his duty in the interests of justice."

"I am the last man in the world to interfere with anyone who wishes to do his duty, Chi Seng."

The eyes of the lawyer and of the Chinese clerk met. Not the shadow of a smile hovered on the lips of either, but they understood each other perfectly.

"I quite understand, sir," said Ong Chi Seng, "but from my study of the case R. V. Crosbie I am of opinion that the production of such a letter would be damaging to our client."

"I have always had a very high opinion of your legal acumen, Chi Seng."

"It had occurred to me, sir, that if I could persuade my fliend to induce the Chinese woman who has the letter to deliver it into our hands it would save a great deal of trouble."

Mr. Joyce idly drew faces on his blotting-paper.

"I suppose your friend is a business man. In what circumstances do you think he would be induced to part with the letter?"

"He has not got the letter. The Chinese woman has the letter. He is only a relation of the Chinese woman. She is ignorant woman; she did not know the value of that letter till my friend told her."

"What value did he put on it?"

"Ten thousand dollars, sir."

"Good God! Where on earth do you suppose Mrs. Crosbie can get ten thousand dollars! I tell you the letter's a forgery."

He looked up at Ong Chi Seng as he spoke. The clerk was unmoved by the outburst. He stood at the side of the desk, civil, cool, and observant.

"Mr. Crosbie owns an eighth share of the Betong Rubber Estate and a sixth share of the Selantan River Rubber Estate. I have a fliend who will lend him the money on the security of—his property."

"You have a large circle of acquaintance, Chi Seng."

"Yes, sir."

"Well, you can tell them all to go to hell. I would never advise Mr. Crosbie to give a penny more than five thousand for a letter that can be very easily explained."

"The Chinese woman does not want to sell the letter, sir. My fliend took a long time to persuade her. It is useless to offer her less than the sum mentioned."

Mr. Joyce looked at Ong Chi Seng for at least three minutes. The clerk bore the searching scrutiny without embarrassment. He stood in a respectful attitude with downcast eyes. Mr. Joyce knew his man. Clever fellow, Chi Seng, he thought, I wonder how much he's going to get out of it.

"Ten thousand dollars is a very large sum."

"Mr. Crosbie will certainly pay it rather than see his wife hanged, sir."

Again Mr. Joyce paused. What more did Chi Seng know than he had said? He must be pretty sure of his ground if he was obviously so unwilling to bargain. That sum had been fixed because whoever it was that was managing the affair knew it was the largest amount that Robert Crosbie could raise.

"Where is the Chinese woman now?" asked Mr. Joyce.

"She is staying at the house of my fliend, sir."

"Will she come here?"

"I think it more better if you go to her, sir. I can take you to the house tonight and she will give you the letter. She is very ignorant woman, sir, and she does not understand cheques."

"I wasn't thinking of giving her a cheque. I will bring bank notes with me."

"It would only be waste of valuable time to bring less than ten thousand dollars, sir."

"I quite understand."

"I will go and tell my fliend after I have had my tiffin, sir."

"Very good. You'd better meet me outside the club at ten o'clock tonight."

"With pleasure, sir," said Ong Chi Seng.

He gave Mr. Joyce a little bow and left the room. Mr. Joyce went out to have luncheon, too. He went to the club and here, as he had expected, he saw Robert Crosbie. He was sitting at a crowded table, and as he passed him, looking for a place, Mr. Joyce touched him on the shoulder.

"I'd like a word or two with you before you go," he said.

"Right you are. Let me know when you're ready."

Mr. Joyce had made up his mind how to tackle him. He played a rubber of bridge after luncheon in order to allow time for the club to empty itself. He did not want on this particular matter to see Crosbie in his office. Presently Crosbie came into the card-room and looked on till the game was finished. The other players went on their various affairs, and the two were left alone.

"A rather unfortunate thing has happened, old man," said Mr. Joyce, in a tone which he sought to render as casual as possible. "It appears that your wife sent a letter to Hammond asking him to come to the bungalow on the night he was killed."

"But that's impossible," cried Crosbie. "She's always stated that she had had no communication with Hammond. I know from my own knowledge that she hadn't set eyes on him for a couple of months."

"The fact remains that the letter exists. It's in the possession of the Chinese woman Hammond was living with. Your wife meant to give you a present on your birthday, and she wanted Hammond to help her to get it. In the emotional excitement that she suffered from after the tragedy, she forgot all about it, and having once denied having any communication with Hammond she was afraid to say that she had made a mistake. It was, of course, very unfortunate, but I dare say it was not unnatural."

Crosbie did not speak. His large, red face bore an expression of complete bewilderment, and Mr. Joyce was at once relieved and exasperated by his lack of comprehension. He was a stupid man, and Mr. Joyce had no patience with stupidity. But his distress since the catastrophe had touched a soft spot in the lawyer's heart; and Mrs. Crosbie had struck the right note when she asked him to help her, not for her sake, but for her husband's.

"I need not tell you that it would be very awkward if this letter found its way into the hands of the prosecution. Your wife has lied, and she would be asked to explain the lie. It alters things a little if Hammond did not intrude, an unwanted guest, but came to your house by invitation. It would be easy to arouse in the assessors a certain indecision of mind."

Mr. Joyce hesitated. He was face to face now with his decision. If it had been a time for humour, he could have smiled at the reflection that he was taking so grave a step, and that the man for whom he was taking it had not the smallest conception of its gravity. If he gave the matter a thought, he probably imagined that what Mr. Joyce was doing was what any lawyer did in the ordinary run of business.

"My dear Robert, you are not only my client, but my friend. I think we must get hold of that letter. It'll cost a good deal of money. Except for that I should have preferred to say nothing to you about it."

"How much?"

"Ten thousand dollars."

"That's a devil of a lot. With the slump and one thing and another it'll take just about all I've got."

"Can you get it at once?"

"I suppose so. Old Charlie Meadows will let me have it on my tin shares and on those two estates I'm interested in."

"Then will you?"

"Is it absolutely necessary?"

"If you want your wife to be acquitted."

Crosbie grew very red. His mouth sagged strangely.

"But . . ." he could not find words, his face now was purple. "But I don't understand. She can explain. You don't mean to say they'd find her guilty? They couldn't hang her for putting a noxious vermin out of the way."

"Of course they wouldn't hang her. They might only find her guilty of manslaughter. She'd probably get off with two or three years."

Crosbie started to his feet and his red face was distraught with horror.

"Three years."

Then something seemed to dawn in that slow intelligence of his. His mind was darkness across which shot suddenly a flash of lightning, and though the succeeding darkness was as profound, there remained the memory of something not seen but perhaps just descried. Mr. Joyce saw that Crosbie's big red hands, coarse and hard with all the odd jobs he had set them to, trembled.

"What was the present she wanted to make me?"

"She says she wanted to give you a new gun."

Once more that great red face flushed a deeper red.

"When have you got to have the money ready?"

There was something odd in his voice now. It sounded as though he spoke with invisible hands clutching at his throat.

"At ten o'clock tonight. I thought you could bring it to my office at about six."

"Is the woman coming to you?"

"No, I'm going to her."

"I'll bring the money. I'll come with you."

Mr. Joyce looked at him sharply.

"Do you think there's any need for you to do that? I think it would be better if you left me to deal with this matter by myself."

"It's my money, isn't it? I'm going to come."

Mr. Joyce shrugged his shoulders. They rose and shook hands. Mr. Joyce looked at him curiously.

At ten o'clock they met in the empty club.

"Everything all right?" asked Mr. Joyce.

"Yes. I've got the money in my pocket."

"Let's go then."

They walked down the steps. Mr. Joyce's car was waiting for them in the square, silent at that hour, and as they came to it Ong Chi Seng stepped out of the shadow of a house. He took his seat beside the driver and gave him a direction. They drove past the Hotel de l"Europe and turned up by the Sailor's Home to get into Victoria Street. Here the Chinese shops were still open, idlers lounged about, and in the roadway rickshaws and motor-cars and gharries gave a busy air to the scene. Suddenly their car stopped and Chi Seng turned round.

"I think it more better if we walk here, sir," he said.

They got out and he went on. They followed a step or two behind. Then he asked them to stop.

"You wait here, sir. I go in and speak to my fliend."

He went into a shop, open to the street, where three or four Chinese were standing behind the counter. It was one of those strange shops where nothing was on view, and you wondered what it was they sold there. They saw him address a stout man in a duck suit with a large gold chain across his breast, and the man shot a quick glance out into the night. He gave Chi Seng a key and Chi Seng came out. He beckoned to the two men waiting and slid into a doorway at the side of the shop. They followed him and found themselves at the foot of a flight of stairs.

"If you wait a minute I will light a match," he said, always resourceful. "You come upstairs, please."

He held a Japanese match in front of them, but it scarcely dispelled the darkness and they groped their way up behind him. On the first floor he unlocked a door and going in lit a gas-jet.

"Come in, please," he said.

It was a small square room, with one window, and the only furniture consisted of two low Chinese beds covered with matting. In one corner was a large chest, with an elaborate lock, and on this stood a shabby tray with an opium pipe on it and a lamp. There was in the room the faint, acrid scent of the drug. They sat down and Ong Chi Seng offered them cigarettes. In a moment the door was opened by the fat Chinaman whom they had seen behind the counter. He bade them good evening in very good English, and sat down by the side of his fellow-countryman.

"The Chinese woman is just coming," said Chi Seng.

A boy from the shop brought in a tray with a teapot and cups and the Chinaman offered them a cup of tea. Crosbie refused. The Chinese talked to one another in undertones, but Crosbie and Mr. Joyce were silent. At last there was the sound of a voice outside; someone was calling in a low tone; and the Chinaman went to the door. He opened it, spoke a few words, and ushered a woman in. Mr. Joyce looked at her. He had heard much about her since Hammond's death, but he had never seen her. She was a stoutish person, not very young, with a broad, phlegmatic face, she was powdered and rouged and her eyebrows were a thin black line, but she gave you the impression of a woman of character. She wore a pale blue jacket and a white skirt, her costume was not quite European nor quite Chinese, but on her feet were little Chinese silk slippers. She wore heavy gold chains round her neck, gold bangles on her wrists, gold ear-rings, and elaborate gold pins in her black hair. She walked in slowly, with the air of a woman sure of herself, but with a certain heaviness of tread, and sat down on the bed beside Ong Chi Seng. He said something to her and nodding she gave an incurious glance at the two white men.

"Has she got the letter?" asked Mr. Joyce.

"Yes, sir."

Crosbie said nothing, but produced a roll of five-hundred-dollar notes. He counted out twenty and handed them to Chi Seng.

"Will you see if that is correct?"

The clerk counted them and gave them to the fat Chinaman.

"Quite correct, sir."

The Chinaman counted them once more and put them in his pocket. He spoke again to the woman and she drew from her bosom a letter. She gave it to Chi Seng who cast his eyes over it.

"This is the right document, sir," he said, and was about to give it to Mr. Joyce when Crosbie took it from him.

"Let me look at it," he said.

Mr. Joyce watched him read and then held out his hand for it.

"You'd better let me have it."

Crosbie folded it up deliberately and put it in his pocket.

"No, I'm going to keep it myself. It's cost me enough money."

Mr. Joyce made no rejoinder. The three Chinese watched the little passage, but what they thought about it, or whether they thought, it was impossible to tell from their impassive countenances. Mr. Joyce rose to his feet.

"Do you want me any more tonight, sir?" said Ong Chi Seng.

"No." He knew that the clerk wished to stay behind in order to get his agreed share of the money, and he turned to Crosbie. "Are you ready?"

Crosbie did not answer, but stood up. The Chinaman went to the door and opened it for them. Chi Seng found a bit of candle and lit it in order to light them down, and the two Chinese accompanied them to the street. They left the woman sitting quietly on the bed smoking a cigarette. When they reached the street the Chinese left them and went once more upstairs.

"What are you going to do with that letter?" asked Mr. Joyce.

"Keep it."

They walked to where the car was waiting for them and here Mr. Joyce offered his friend a lift. Crosbie shook his head.

"I'm going to walk." He hesitated a little and shuffled his feet. "I went to Singapore on the night of Hammond's death partly to buy a new gun that a man I knew wanted to dispose of. Good night."

He disappeared quickly into the darkness.

Mr. Joyce was quite right about the trial. The assessors went into court fully determined to acquit Mrs. Crosbie. She gave evidence on her own behalf. She told her story simply and with straightforwardness. The D.P.P. was a kindly man and it was plain that he took no great pleasure in his task. He asked the necessary questions in a deprecating manner. His speech for the prosecution might really have been a speech for the defence, and the assessors took less than five minutes to consider their popular verdict. It was impossible to prevent the great outburst of applause with which it was received by the crowd that packed the courthouse. The judge congratulated Mrs. Crosbie and she was a free woman.

No one had expressed a more violent disapprobation of Hammond's behaviour than Mrs. Joyce; she was a woman loyal to her friends and she had insisted on the Crosbies staying with her after the trial, for she in common with everyone else had no doubt of the result, till they could make arrangements to go away. It was out of the question for poor, dear, brave Leslie to return to the bungalow at which the horrible catastrophe had taken place.

The trial was over by half past twelve and when they reached the Joyces' house a grand luncheon was awaiting them. Cocktails were ready, Mrs. Joyce's million-dollar cocktail was celebrated through all the Malay States, and Mrs. Joyce drank Leslie's health. She was a talkative, vivacious woman, and now she was in the highest spirits. It was fortunate, for the rest of them were silent. She did not wonder; her husband never had much to say, and the other two were naturally exhausted from the long strain to which they had been subjected. During luncheon she carried on a bright and spirited monologue. Then coffee was served.

"Now, children," she said in her gay, bustling fashion, "you must have a rest and after tea I shall take you both for a drive to the sea."

Mr. Joyce, who lunched at home only by exception, had of course to go back to his office.

"I'm afraid I can't do that, Mrs. Joyce," said Crosbie. "I've got to get back to the estate at once."

"Not today?" she cried.

"Yes, now. I've neglected it for too long and I have urgent business. But I shall be very grateful if you will keep Leslie until we have decided what to do."

Mrs. Joyce was about to expostulate, but her husband prevented her.

"If he must go, he must, and there's an end of it."

There was something in the lawyer's tone which made her look at him quickly. She held her tongue and there was a moment's silence. Then Crosbie spoke again.

"If you'll forgive me, I'll start at once so that I can get there before dark." He rose from the table. "Will you come and see me off, Leslie?"

"Of course."

They went out of the dining-room together.

"I think that's rather inconsiderate of him," said Mrs. Joyce. "He must know that Leslie wants to be with him just now."

"I'm sure he wouldn't go if it wasn't absolutely necessary."

"Well, I'll just see that Leslie's room is ready for her. She wants a complete rest, of course, and then amusement."

Mrs. Joyce left the room and Joyce sat down again. In a short time he heard Crosbie start the engine of his motor-cycle and then noisily scrunch over the gravel of the garden path. He got up and went into the drawing-room. Mrs. Crosbie was standing in the middle of it, looking into space, and in her hand was an open letter. He recognized it. She gave him a glance as he came in and he saw that she was deathly pale.

"He knows," she whispered.

Mr. Joyce went up to her and took the letter from her hand. He lit a match and set the paper afire. She watched it burn. When he could hold it no longer he dropped it on the tiled floor and they both looked at the paper curl and blacken. Then he trod it into ashes with his foot.

"What does he know?"

She gave him a long, long stare and into her eyes came a strange look. Was it contempt or despair? Mr. Joyce could not tell.

"He knows that Geoff was my lover."

Mr. Joyce made no movement and uttered no sound.

"He'd been my lover for years. He became my lover almost immediately after he came back from the war. We knew how careful we must be. When we became lovers I pretended I was tired of him, and he seldom came to the house when Robert was there. I used to drive out to a place we knew and he met me, two or three times a week, and when Robert went to Singapore he used to come to the bungalow late, when the boys had gone for the night. We saw one another constantly, all the time, and not a soul had the smallest suspicion of it. And then lately, a year ago, he began to change. I didn't know what was the matter. I couldn't believe that he didn't care for me any more. He always denied it. I was frantic. I made him scenes. Sometimes I thought he hated me. Oh, if you knew what agonies I endured. I passed through hell. I knew he didn't want me any more and I wouldn't let him go. Misery! Misery! I loved him. I'd given him everything. He was my life. And then I heard he was living with a Chinese woman. I couldn't believe it. I wouldn't believe it. At last I saw her, I saw her with my own eyes, walking in the village, with her gold bracelets and her necklaces, an old, fat Chinese woman. She was older than I was. Horrible! They all knew in the kampong that she was his mistress. And when I passed her, she looked at me and I knew that she knew I was his mistress too. I sent for him. I told him I must see him. You've read the letter. I was mad to write it. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't care. I hadn't seen him for ten days. It was a lifetime. And when last we'd parted he took me in his arms and kissed me, and told me not to worry. And he went straight from my arms to hers."

She had been speaking in a low voice, vehemently, and now she stopped and wrung her hands.

"That damned letter. We'd always been so careful. He always tore up any word I wrote to him the moment he'd read it. How was I to know he'd leave that one? He came, and I told him I knew about the Chinawoman. He denied it. He said it was only scandal. I was beside myself. I don't know what I said to him. Oh, I hated him then. I tore him limb from limb. I said everything I could to wound him. I insulted him. I could have spat in his face. And at last he turned on me. He told me he was sick and tired of me and never wanted to see me again. He said I bored him to death. And then he acknowledged that it was true about the Chinawoman. He said he'd known her for years, before the war, and she was the only woman who really meant anything to him, and the rest was just pastime. And he said he was glad I knew and now at last I'd leave him alone. And then I don't know what happened, I was beside myself, I saw red. I seized the revolver and I fired. He gave a cry and I saw I'd hit him. He staggered and rushed for the veranda. I ran after him and fired again. He fell and then I stood over him and I fired till the revolver went click, click, and I knew there were no more cartridges."

At last she stopped, panting. Her face was no longer human, it was distorted with cruelty, and rage and pain. You would never have thought that this quiet, refined woman was capable of such fiendish passion. Mr. Joyce took a step backwards. He was absolutely aghast at the sight of her. It was not a face, it was a gibbering, hideous mask. Then they heard a voice calling from another room, a loud, friendly, cheerful voice. It was Mrs. Joyce.

"Come along, Leslie darling, your room's ready. You must be dropping with sleep."

Mrs. Crosbie's features gradually composed themselves. Those passions, so clearly delineated, were smoothed away as with your hand you would smooth crumpled paper, and in a minute the face was cool and calm and unlined. She was a trifle pale, but her lips broke into a pleasant, affable smile. She was once more the well-bred and even distinguished woman.

"I'm coming, Dorothy dear. I'm sorry to give you so much trouble."





Before the Party


Mrs. Skinner liked to be in good time. She was already dressed, in black silk as befitted her age and the mourning she wore for her son-in-law, and now she put on her toque. She was a little uncertain about it, since the egrets' feathers which adorned it might very well arouse in some of the friends she would certainly meet at the party acid expostulations; and of course it was shocking to kill those beautiful white birds, in the mating season too, for the sake of their feathers; but there they were, so pretty and stylish, and it would have been silly to refuse them, and it would have hurt her son-in-law's feelings. He had brought them all the way from Borneo and he expected her to be so pleased with them. Kathleen had made herself rather unpleasant about them, she must wish she hadn't now, after what had happened, but Kathleen had never really liked Harold. Mrs. Skinner, standing at her dressing-table, placed the toque on her head, it was after all the only nice hat she had, and put in a pin with a large jet knob. If anybody spoke to her about the ospreys she had her answer.

"I know it's dreadful," she would say, "and I wouldn't dream of buying them, but my poor son-in-law brought them back the last time he was home on leave."

That would explain her possession of them and excuse their use. Everyone had been very kind. Mrs. Skinner took a clean handkerchief from a drawer and sprinkled a little Eau de Cologne on it. She never used scent, and she had always thought it rather fast, but Eau de Cologne was so refreshing. She was very nearly ready now, and her eyes wandered out of the window behind her looking-glass. Canon Heywood had a beautiful day for his garden-party. It was warm and the sky was blue; the trees had not yet lost the fresh green of the spring. She smiled as she saw her little granddaughter in the strip of garden behind the house busily raking her very own flower-bed. Mrs. Skinner wished Joan were not quite so pale, it was a mistake to have kept her so long in the tropics; and she was so grave for her age, you never saw her run about; she played quiet games of her own invention and watered her garden. Mrs. Skinner gave the front of her dress a little pat, took up her gloves, and went downstairs.

Kathleen was at the writing-table in the window busy with lists she was making, for she was honorary secretary of the Ladies' Golf Club, and when there were competitions had a good deal to do. But she too was ready for the party.

"I see you've put on your jumper after all," said Mrs. Skinner.

They had discussed at luncheon whether Kathleen should wear her jumper or her black chiffon. The jumper was black and white, and Kathleen thought it rather smart, but it was hardly mourning. Millicent, however, was in favour of it.

"There's no reason why we should all look as if we'd just come from a funeral," she said. "Harold's been dead eight months."

To Mrs. Skinner it seemed rather unfeeling to talk like that. Millicent was strange since her return from Borneo.

"You're not going to leave off your weeds yet, darling?" she asked.

Millicent did not give a direct answer.

"People don't wear mourning in the way they used," she said. She paused a little and when she went on there was a tone in her voice which Mrs. Skinner thought quite peculiar. It was plain that Kathleen noticed it too, for she gave her sister a curious look. "I'm sure Harold wouldn't wish me to wear mourning for him indefinitely."

"I dressed early because I wanted to say something to Millicent," said Kathleen in reply to her mother's observation.

"Oh?"

Kathleen did not explain. But she put her lists aside and with knitted brows read for the second time a letter from a lady who complained that the committee had most unfairly marked down her handicap from twenty-four to eighteen. It requires a good deal of tact to be honorary secretary to a ladies' golf club. Mrs. Skinner began to put on her new gloves. The sun-blinds kept the room cool and dark. She looked at the great wooden hornbill, gaily painted, which Harold had left in her safekeeping; and it seemed a little odd and barbaric to her, but he had set much store on it. It had some religious significance and Canon Heywood had been greatly struck by it. On the wall, over the sofa, were Malay weapons, she forgot what they were called, and here and there on occasional tables pieces of silver and brass which Harold at various times had sent to them. She had liked Harold and involuntarily her eyes sought his photograph which stood on the piano with photographs of her two daughters, her grandchild, her sister, and her sister's son.

"Why, Kathleen, where's Harold's photograph?" she asked.

Kathleen looked round. It no longer stood in its place.

"Someone's taken it away," said Kathleen.

Surprised and puzzled, she got up and went over to the piano. The photographs had been rearranged so that no gap should show.

"Perhaps Millicent wanted to have it in her bedroom," said Mrs. Skinner.

"I should have noticed it. Besides, Millicent has several photographs of Harold. She keeps them locked up."

Mrs. Skinner had thought it very peculiar that her daughter should have no photographs of Harold in her room. Indeed she had spoken of it once, but Millicent had made no reply. Millicent had been strangely silent since she came back from Borneo, and had not encouraged the sympathy Mrs. Skinner would have been so willing to show her. She seemed unwilling to speak of her great loss. Sorrow took people in different ways. Her husband had said the best thing was to leave her alone. The thought of him turned her ideas to the party they were going to.

"Father asked if I thought he ought to wear a top-hat," she said. "I said I thought it was just as well to be on the safe side."

It was going to be quite a grand affair. They were having ices, strawberry and vanilla, from Boddy, the confectioner, but the Hey-woods were making the iced coffee at home. Everyone would be there. They had been asked to meet the Bishop of Hong Kong, who was staying with the Canon, an old college friend of his, and he was going to speak on the Chinese missions. Mrs. Skinner, whose daughter had lived in the East for eight years and whose son-in-law had been Resident of a district in Borneo, was in a flutter of interest. Naturally it meant more to her than to people who had never had anything to do with the Colonies and that sort of thing.

"What can they know of England who only England know?" as Mr. Skinner said.

He came into the room at that moment. He was a lawyer, as his father had been before him, and he had offices in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He went up to London every morning and came down every evening. He was only able to accompany his wife and daughters to the Canon's garden-party because the Canon had very wisely chosen a Saturday to have it on. Mr. Skinner looked very well in his tail-coat and pepper-and-salt trousers. He was not exactly dressy, but he was neat. He looked like a respectable family solicitor, which indeed he was; his firm never touched work that was not perfectly above board, and if a client went to him with some trouble that was not quite nice, Mr. Skinner would look grave.

"I don't think this is the sort of case that we very much care to undertake," he said. "I think you'd do better to go elsewhere."

He drew towards him his writing-block and scribbled a name and address on it. He tore off a sheet of paper and handed it to his client.

"If I were you I think I would go and see these people. If you mention my name I believe they'll do anything they can for you."

Mr. Skinner was clean-shaven and very bald. His pale lips were tight and thin, but his blue eyes were shy. He had no colour in his cheeks and his face was much lined.

"I see you've put on your new trousers," said Mrs. Skinner.

"I thought it would be a good opportunity," he answered. "I was wondering if I should wear a buttonhole."

"I wouldn't, father," said Kathleen. "I don't think it's awfully good form."

"A lot of people will be wearing them," said Mrs. Skinner.

"Only clerks and people like that," said Kathleen. "The Heywoods have had to ask everybody, you know. And besides, we are in mourning."

"I wonder if there'll be a collection after the Bishop's address," said Mr. Skinner.

"I should hardly think so," said Mrs. Skinner.

"I think it would be rather bad form," agreed Kathleen.

"It's as well to be on the safe side," said Mr. Skinner. "I'll give for all of us. I was wondering if ten shillings would be enough or if I must give a pound."

"If you give anything I think you ought to give a pound, father," said Kathleen.

"I'll see when the time comes. I don't want to give less than anyone else, but on the other hand I see no reason to give more than I need."

Kathleen put away her papers in the drawer of the writing-table and stood up. She looked at her wrist-watch.

"Is Millicent ready?" asked Mrs. Skinner.

"There's plenty of time. We're only asked at four, and I don't think we ought to arrive much before half past. I told Davis to bring the car round at four-fifteen."

Generally Kathleen drove the car, but on grand occasions like this Davis, who was the gardener, put on his uniform and acted as chauffeur. It looked better when you drove up, and naturally Kathleen didn't much want to drive herself when she was wearing her new jumper. The sight of her mother forcing her fingers one by one into her new gloves reminded her that she must put on her own. She smelt them to see if any odour of the cleaning still clung to them. It was very slight. She didn't believe anyone would notice.

At last the door opened and Millicent came in. She wore her widow's weeds. Mrs. Skinner never could get used to them, but of course she knew that Millicent must wear them for a year. It was a pity they didn't suit her; they suited some people. She had tried on Millicent's bonnet once, with its white band and long veil, and thought she looked very well in it. Of course she hoped dear Alfred would survive her, but if he didn't she would never go out of weeds. Queen Victoria never had. It was different for Millicent; Millicent was a much younger woman; she was only thirty-six: it was very sad to be a widow at thirty-six. And there wasn't much chance of her marrying again. Kathleen wasn't very likely to marry now, she was thirty-five; last time Millicent and Harold had come home she had suggested that they should have Kathleen to stay with them; Harold had seemed willing enough, but Millicent said it wouldn't do. Mrs. Skinner didn't know why not. It would give her a chance. Of course they didn't want to get rid of her, but a girl ought to marry, and somehow all the men they knew at home were married already. Millicent said the climate was trying. It was true she was a bad colour. No one would think now that Millicent had been the prettier of the two. Kathleen had fined down as she grew older, of course some people said she was too thin, but now that she had cut her hair, with her cheeks red from playing golf in all weathers, Mrs. Skinner thought her quite pretty. No one could say that of poor Millicent; she had lost her figure completely; she had never been tall, and now that she had filled out she looked stocky. She was a good deal too fat; Mrs. Skinner supposed it was due to the tropical heat that prevented her from taking exercise. Her skin was sallow and muddy; and her blue eyes, which had been her best feature, had gone quite pale.

"She ought to do something about her neck," Mrs. Skinner reflected. "She's becoming dreadfully jowly."

She had spoken of it once or twice to her husband. He remarked that Millicent wasn't as young as she was; that might be, but she needn't let herself go altogether. Mrs. Skinner made up her mind to talk to her daughter seriously, but of course she must respect her grief, and she would wait till the year was up. She was just as glad to have this reason to put off a conversation the thought of which made her slightly nervous. For Millicent was certainly changed. There was something sullen in her face which made her mother not quite at home with her. Mrs. Skinner liked to say aloud all the thoughts that passed through her head, but Millicent when you made a remark (just to say something, you know) had an awkward habit of not answering, so that you wondered whether she had heard. Sometimes Mrs. Skinner found it so irritating, that not to be quite sharp with Millicent she had to remind herself that poor Harold had only been dead eight months.

The light from the window fell on the widow's heavy face as she advanced silently, but Kathleen stood with her back to it. She watched her sister for a moment.

"Millicent, there's something I want to say to you," she said. "I was playing golf with Gladys Heywood this morning."

"Did you beat her?" asked Millicent.

Gladys Heywood was the Canon's only unmarried daughter.

"She told me something about you which I think you ought to know."

Millicent's eyes passed beyond her sister to the little girl watering flowers in the garden.

"Have you told Annie to give Joan her tea in the kitchen, mother?" she said.

"Yes, she'll have it when the servants have theirs."

Kathleen looked at her sister coolly.

"The Bishop spent two or three days at Singapore on his way home," she went on. "He's very fond of travelling. He's been to Borneo, and he knows a good many of the people that you know."

"He'll be interested to see you, dear," said Mrs. Skinner. "Did he know poor Harold?"

"Yes, he met him at Kuala Solor. He remembers him very well. He says he was shocked to hear of his death."

Millicent sat down and began to put on her black gloves. It seemed strange to Mrs. Skinner that she received these remarks with complete silence.

"Oh, Millicent," she said, "Harold's photo has disappeared. Have you taken it?"

"Yes, I put it away."

"I should have thought you'd like to have it out."

Once more Millicent said nothing. It really was an exasperating habit.

Kathleen turned slightly in order to face her sister.

"Millicent, why did you tell us that Harold died of fever?"

The widow made no gesture, she looked at Kathleen with steady eyes, but her sallow skin darkened with a flush. She did not reply.

"What do you mean, Kathleen?" asked Mr. Skinner, with surprise.

"The Bishop says that Harold committed suicide."

Mrs. Skinner gave a startled cry, but her husband put out a deprecating hand.

"Is it true, Millicent?"

"It is."

"But why didn't you tell us?"

Millicent paused for an instant. She fingered idly a piece of Brunei brass which stood on the table by her side. That too had been a present from Harold.

"I thought it better for Joan that her father should be thought to have died of fever. I didn't want her to know anything about it."

"You've put us in an awfully awkward position," said Kathleen, frowning a little. "Gladys Heywood said she thought it rather nasty of me not to have told her the truth. I had the greatest difficulty in getting her to believe that I knew absolutely nothing about it. She said her father was rather put out. He says, after all the years we've known one another, and considering that he married you, and the terms we've been on, and all that, he does think we might have had confidence in him. And at all events, if we didn't want to tell him the truth we needn't have told him a lie."

"I must say I sympathize with him there," said Mr. Skinner, acidly.

"Of course I told Gladys that we weren't to blame. We only told them what you told us."

"I hope it didn't put you off your game," said Millicent.

"Really, my dear, I think that is a most improper observation," exclaimed her father.

He rose from his chair, walked over to the empty fireplace, and from force of habit stood in front of it with parted coat-tails.

"It was my business," said Millicent, "and if I chose to keep it to myself I didn't see why I shouldn't."

"It doesn't look as if you had any affection for your mother if you didn't even tell her," said Mrs. Skinner.

Millicent shrugged her shoulders.

"You might have known it was bound to come out," said Kathleen.

"Why? I didn't expect that two gossiping old parsons would have nothing else to talk about than me."

"When the Bishop said he'd been to Borneo it's only natural that the Heywoods should ask him if he knew you and Harold."

"All that's neither here nor there," said Mr. Skinner. "I think you should certainly have told us the truth, and we could have decided what was the best thing to do. As a solicitor I can tell you that in the long run it only makes things worse if you attempt to hide them."

"Poor Harold," said Mrs. Skinner, and the tears began to trickle down her raddled cheeks. "It seems dreadful. He was always a good son-in-law to me. Whatever induced him to do such a dreadful thing?"

"The climate."

"I think you'd better give us all the facts, Millicent," said her father.

"Kathleen will tell you."

Kathleen hesitated. What she had to say really was rather dreadful. It seemed terrible that such things should happen to a family like theirs.

"The Bishop says he cut his throat."

Mrs. Skinner gasped and she went impulsively up to her bereaved daughter. She wanted to fold her in her arms.

"My poor child," she sobbed.

But Millicent withdrew herself.

"Please don't fuss me, mother. I really can't stand being mauled about."

"Really, Millicent," said Mr. Skinner, with a frown.

He did not think she was behaving very nicely.

Mrs. Skinner dabbed her eyes carefully with her handkerchief and with a sigh and a little shake of the head returned to her chair. Kathleen fidgeted with the long chain she wore round her neck.

"It does seem rather absurd that I should have to be told the details of my brother-in-law's death by a friend. It makes us all look such fools. The Bishop wants very much to see you, Millicent; he wants to tell you how much he feels for you." She paused, but Millicent did not speak. "He says that Millicent had been away with Joan and when she came back she found poor Harold lying dead on his bed."

"It must have been a great shock," said Mr. Skinner.

Mrs. Skinner began to cry again, but Kathleen put her hand gently on her shoulder.

"Don't cry, mother," she said. "It'll make your eyes red and people will think it so funny."

They were all silent while Mrs. Skinner, drying her eyes, made a successful effort to control herself. It seemed very strange to her that this very moment she should be wearing in her toque the ospreys that poor Harold had given her.

"There's something else I ought to tell you," said Kathleen.

Millicent looked at her sister again, without haste, and her eyes were steady, but watchful. She had the look of a person who is waiting for a sound which he is afraid of missing.

"I don't want to say anything to wound you, dear," Kathleen went on, "but there's something else and I think you ought to know it. The Bishop says that Harold drank."

"Oh, my dear, how dreadful!" cried Mrs. Skinner. "What a shocking thing to say. Did Gladys Heywood tell you? What did you say?"

"I said it was entirely untrue."

"This is what comes of making secrets of things," said Mr. Skinner, irritably. "It's always the same. If you try and hush a thing up all sorts of rumours get about which are ten times worse than the truth."

"They told the Bishop in Singapore that Harold had killed himself while he was suffering from delirium tremens. I think for all our sakes you ought to deny that, Millicent."

"It's such a dreadful thing to have said about anyone who's dead," said Mrs. Skinner. "And it'll be so bad for Joan when she grows up."

"But what is the foundation of this story, Millicent?" asked her father. "Harold was always very abstemious."

"Here," said the widow.

"Did he drink?"

"Like a fish."

The answer was so unexpected, and the tone so sardonic, that all three of them were startled.

"Millicent, how can you talk like that of your husband when he's dead?" cried her mother, clasping her neatly gloved hands. "I can't understand you. You've been so strange since you came back. I could never have believed that a girl of mine could take her husband's death like that."

"Never mind about that, mother," said Mr. Skinner. "We can go into all that later."

He walked to the window and looked out at the sunny little garden, and then walked back into the room. He took his pince-nez out of his pocket, and though he had no intention of putting them on, wiped them with his handkerchief. Millicent looked at him and in her eyes, unmistakably, was a look of irony which was quite cynical. Mr. Skinner was vexed. He had finished his week's work and he was a free man till Monday morning. Though he had told his wife that this garden-party was a great nuisance and he would much sooner have tea quietly in his own garden, he had been looking forward to it. He did not care very much about Chinese missions, but it would be interesting to meet the Bishop. And now this! It was not the kind of thing he cared to be mixed up in; it was most unpleasant to be told on a sudden that his son-in-law was a drunkard and a suicide. Millicent was thoughtfully smoothing her white cuffs. Her coolness irritated him; but instead of addressing her he spoke to his younger daughter.

"Why don't you sit down, Kathleen? Surely there are plenty of chairs in the room."

Kathleen drew forward a chair and without a word seated herself. Mr. Skinner stopped in front of Millicent and faced her.

"Of course I see why you told us Harold had died of fever. I think it was a mistake, because that sort of thing is bound to come out sooner or later. I don't know how far what the Bishop has told the Heywoods coincides with the facts, but if you will take my advice you will tell us everything as circumstantially as you can, then we can see. We can't hope that it will go no further now that Canon Heywood and Gladys know. In a place like this people are bound to talk. It will make it easier for all of us if we at all events know the exact truth."

Mrs. Skinner and Kathleen thought he put the matter very well. They waited for Millicent's reply. She had listened with an impassive face; that sudden flush had disappeared and it was once more, as usual, pasty and sallow.

"I don't think you'll much like the truth if I tell it to you," she said.

"You must know that you can count on our sympathy and understanding," said Kathleen gravely.

Millicent gave her a glance and the shadow of a smile flickered across her set mouth. She looked slowly at the three of them. Mrs. Skinner had an uneasy impression that she looked at them as though they were mannequins at a dressmaker's. She seemed to live in a different world from theirs and to have no connexion with them.

"You know, I wasn't in love with Harold when I married him," she said reflectively.

Mrs. Skinner was on the point of making an exclamation when a rapid gesture of her husband, barely indicated, but after so many years of married life perfectly significant, stopped her. Millicent went on. She spoke with a level voice, slowly, and there was little change of expression in her tone.

"I was twenty-seven, and no one else seemed to want to marry me. It's true he was forty-four, and it seemed rather old, but he had a very good position, hadn't he? I wasn't likely to get a better chance."

Mrs. Skinner felt inclined to cry again, but she remembered the party.

"Of course I see now why you took his photograph away," she said dolefully.

"Don't, mother," exclaimed Kathleen.

It had been taken when he was engaged to Millicent and was a very good photograph of Harold. Mrs. Skinner had always thought him quite a fine man. He was heavily built, tall and perhaps a little too fat, but he held himself well, and his presence was imposing. He was inclined to be bald, even then, but men did go bald very early nowadays, and he said that topees, sun-helmets, you know, were very bad for the hair. He had a small dark moustache, and his face was deeply burned by the sun. Of course his best feature was his eyes; they were brown and large, like Joan's. His conversation was interesting. Kathleen said he was pompous, but Mrs. Skinner didn't think him so, she didn't mind it if a man laid down the law; and when she saw, as she very soon did, that he was attracted by Millicent she began to like him very much. He was always very attentive to Mrs. Skinner, and she listened as though she were really interested when he spoke of his district, and told her of the big game he had killed. Kathleen said he had a pretty good opinion of himself, but Mrs. Skinner came of a generation which accepted without question the good opinion that men had of themselves. Millicent saw very soon which way the wind blew, and though she said nothing to her mother, her mother knew that if Harold asked her she was going to accept him.

Harold was staying with some people who had been thirty years in Borneo and they spoke well of the country. There was no reason why a woman shouldn't live there comfortably; of course the children had to come home when they were seven; but Mrs. Skinner thought it unnecessary to trouble about that yet. She asked Harold to dine, and she told him they were always in to tea. He seemed to be at a loose end, and when his visit to his old friends was drawing to a close, she told him they would be very much pleased if he would come and spend a fortnight with them. It was towards the end of this that Harold and Millicent became engaged. They had a very pretty wedding, they went to Venice for their honeymoon, and then they started for the East. Millicent wrote from various ports at which the ship touched. She seemed happy.

"People were very nice to me at Kuala Solor," she said. Kuala Solor was the chief town of the state of Sembulu. "We stayed with the Resident and everyone asked us to dinner. Once or twice I heard men ask Harold to have a drink, but he refused; he said he had turned over a new leaf now he was a married man. I didn't know why they laughed. Mrs. Gray, the Resident's wife, told me they were all so glad Harold was married. She said it was dreadfully lonely for a bachelor on one of the outstations. When we left Kuala Solor Mrs. Gray said goodbye to me so funnily that I was quite surprised. It was as if she was solemnly putting Harold in my charge."

They listened to her in silence. Kathleen never took her eyes off her sister's impassive face; but Mr. Skinner stared straight in front of him at the Malay arms, krises and parangs, which hung on the wall above the sofa on which his wife sat.

"It wasn't till I went back to Kuala Solor a year and a half later, that I found out why their manner had seemed so odd." Millicent gave a queer little sound like the echo of a scornful laugh. "I knew then a good deal that I hadn't known before. Harold came to England that time in order to marry. He didn't much mind who it was. Do you remember how we spread ourselves out to catch him, mother? We needn't have taken so much trouble."

"I don't know what you mean, Millicent," said Mrs. Skinner, not without acerbity, for the insinuation of scheming did not please her. "I saw he was attracted by you."

Millicent shrugged her heavy shoulders.

"He was a confirmed drunkard. He used to go to bed every night with a bottle of whisky and empty it before morning. The Chief Secretary told him he'd have to resign unless he stopped drinking. He said he'd give him one more chance. He could take his leave then and go to England. He advised him to marry so that when he got back he'd have someone to look after him. Harold married me because he wanted a keeper. They took bets in Kuala Solor on how long I'd make him stay sober."

"But he was in love with you," Mrs. Skinner interrupted. "You don't know how he used to speak to me about you, and at that time you're speaking of, when you went to Kuala Solor to have Joan, he wrote me such a charming letter about you."

Millicent looked at her mother again and a deep colour dyed her sallow skin. Her hands, lying on her lap, began to tremble a little. She thought of those first months of her married life. The government launch took them to the mouth of the river, and they spent the night at the bungalow which Harold said jokingly was their seaside residence. Next day they went up-stream in a prahu. From the novels she had read she expected the rivers of Borneo to be dark and strangely sinister, but the sky was blue, dappled with little white clouds, and the green of the mangroves and the nipahs, washed by the flowing water, glistened in the sun. On each side stretched the pathless jungle, and in the distance, silhouetted against the sky, was the rugged outline of a mountain. The air in the early morning was fresh and buoyant. She seemed to enter upon a friendly, fertile land, and she had a sense of spacious freedom. They watched the banks for monkeys sitting on the branches of the tangled trees, and once Harold pointed out something that looked like a log and said it was a crocodile. The Assistant Resident, in ducks and a topee, was at the landing-stage to meet them, and a dozen trim little soldiers were lined up to do them honour. The Assistant Resident was introduced to her. His name was Simpson.

"By Jove, sir," he said to Harold. "I'm glad to see you back. It's been deuced lonely without you."

The Resident's bungalow, surrounded by a garden in which grew wildly all manner of gay flowers, stood on the top of a low hill. It was a trifle shabby and the furniture was sparse, but the rooms were cool and of generous size.

"The kampong is down there," said Harold, pointing.

Her eyes followed his gesture, and from among the coconut trees rose the beating of a gong. It gave her a queer little sensation in the heart.

Though she had nothing much to do the days passed easily enough. At dawn a boy brought them their tea and they lounged about the veranda, enjoying the fragrance of the morning (Harold in a singlet and a sarong, she in a dressing-gown) till it was time to dress for breakfast. Then Harold went to his office and she spent an hour or two learning Malay. After tiffin he went back to his office while she slept. A cup of tea revived them both, and they went for a walk or played golf on the nine-hole links which Harold had made on a level piece of cleared jungle below the bungalow. Night fell at six and Mr. Simpson came along to have a drink. They chatted till their late dinner hour, and sometimes Harold and Mr. Simpson played chess. The balmy evenings were enchanting. The fireflies turned the bushes just below the veranda into coldly-sparkling, tremulous beacons, and flowering trees scented the air with sweet odours. After dinner they read the papers which had left London six weeks before and presently went to bed. Millicent enjoyed being a married woman, with a house of her own, and she was pleased with the native servants, in their gay sarongs, who went about the bungalow, with bare feet, silent but friendly. It gave her a pleasant sense of importance to be the wife of the Resident. Harold impressed her by the fluency with which he spoke the language, by his air of command, and by his dignity. She went into the court-house now and then to hear him try cases. The multifariousness of his duties and the competent way in which he performed them aroused her respect. Mr. Simpson told her that Harold understood the natives as well as any man in the country. He had the combination of firmness, tact, and good-humour which was essential in dealing with that timid, revengeful, and suspicious race. Millicent began to feel a certain admiration for her husband.

They had been married nearly a year when two English naturalists came to stay with them for a few days on their way to the interior. They brought a pressing recommendation from the governor, and Harold said he wanted to do them proud. Their arrival was an agreeable change. Millicent asked Mr. Simpson to dinner (he lived at the Fort and only dined with them on Sunday nights) and after dinner the men sat down to play bridge. Millicent left them presently and went to bed, but they were so noisy that for some time she could not get to sleep. She did not know at what hour she was awakened by Harold staggering into the room. She kept silent. He made up his mind to have a bath before getting into bed; the bath-house was just below their room, and he went down the steps that led to it. Apparently he slipped, for there was a great clatter, and he began to swear. Then he was violently sick. She heard him sluice the buckets of water over himself and in a little while, walking very cautiously this time, he crawled up the stairs and slipped into bed. Millicent pretended to be asleep. She was disgusted. Harold was drunk. She made up her mind to speak about it in the morning. What would the naturalists think of him? But in the morning Harold was so dignified that she hadn't quite the determination to refer to the matter. At eight Harold and she, with their two guests, sat down to breakfast. Harold looked round the table.

"Porridge," he said. "Millicent, your guests might manage a little Worcester sauce for breakfast, but I don't think they'll much fancy anything else. Personally I shall content myself with a whisky and soda."

The naturalists laughed, but shamefacedly.

"Your husband's a terror," said one of them.

"I should not think I had properly performed the duties of hospitality if I sent you sober to bed on the first night of your visit," said Harold, with his round, stately way of putting things.

Millicent, smiling acidly, was relieved to think that her guests had been as drunk as her husband. The next evening she sat up with them and the party broke up at a reasonable hour. But she was glad when the strangers went on with their journey. Their life resumed its placid course. Some months later Harold went on a tour of inspection of his district and came back with a bad attack of malaria. This was the first time she had seen the disease of which she had heard so much, and when he recovered it did not seem strange to her that Harold was very shaky. She found his manner peculiar. He would come back from the office and stare at her with glazed eyes; he would stand on the veranda, swaying slightly, but still dignified, and make long harangues about the political situation in England; losing the thread of his discourse, he would look at her with an archness which his natural stateliness made somewhat disconcerting and say:

"Pulls you down dreadfully, this confounded malaria. Ah, little woman, you little know the strain it puts upon a man to be an empire builder."

She thought that Mr. Simpson began to look worried, and once or twice, when they were alone, he seemed on the point of saying something to her which his shyness at the last moment prevented. The feeling grew so strong that it made her nervous, and one evening when Harold, she knew not why, had remained later than usual at the office she tackled him.

"What have you got to say to me, Mr. Simpson?" she broke out suddenly.

He blushed and hesitated.

"Nothing. What makes you think I have anything in particular to say to you?"

Mr. Simpson was a thin, weedy youth of four and twenty, with a fine head of waving hair which he took great pains to plaster down very flat. His wrists were swollen and scarred with mosquito bites. Millicent looked at him steadily.

"If it's something to do with Harold don't you think it would be kinder to tell me frankly?"

He grew scarlet now. He shuffled uneasily on his rattan chair. She insisted.

"I'm afraid you'll think it awful cheek," he said at last. "It's rotten of me to say anything about my chief behind his back. Malaria's a rotten thing, and after one's had a bout of it one feels awfully down and out."

He hesitated again. The corners of his mouth sagged as if he were going to cry. To Millicent he seemed like a little boy.

"I'll be as silent as the grave," she said with a smile, trying to conceal her apprehension. "Do tell me."

"I think it's a pity your husband keeps a bottle of whisky at the office. He's apt to take a nip more often than he otherwise would."

Mr. Simpson's voice was hoarse with agitation. Millicent felt a sudden coldness shiver through her. She controlled herself, for she knew that she must not frighten the boy if she were to get out of him all there was to tell. He was unwilling to speak. She pressed him, wheedling, appealing to his sense of duty, and at last she began to cry. Then he told her that Harold had been drunk more or less for the last fortnight, the natives were talking about it, and they said that soon he would be as bad as he had been before his marriage. He had been in the habit of drinking a good deal too much then, but details of that time, notwithstanding all her attempts, Mr. Simpson resolutely declined to give her.

"Do you think he's drinking now?" she asked.

"I don't know."

Millicent felt herself on a sudden hot with shame and anger. The Fort, as it was called because the rifles and the ammunition were kept there, was also the court-house. It stood opposite the Resident's bungalow in a garden of its own. The sun was just about to set and she did not need a hat. She got up and walked across. She found Harold sitting in the office behind the large hall in which he administered justice. There was a bottle of whisky in front of him. He was smoking cigarettes and talking to three or four Malays who stood in front of him listening with obsequious and at the same time scornful smiles. His face was red.

The natives vanished.

"I came to see what you were doing," she said.

He rose, for he always treated her with elaborate politeness, and lurched. Feeling himself unsteady he assumed an elaborate stateliness of demeanour.

"Take a seat, my dear, take a seat. I was detained by press of work."

She looked at him with angry eyes.

"You're drunk," she said.

He stared at her, his eyes bulging a little, and a haughty look gradually traversed his large and fleshy face.

"I haven't the remotest idea what you mean," he said.

She had been ready with a flow of wrathful expostulation, but suddenly she burst into tears. She sank into a chair and hid her face. Harold looked at her for an instant, then the tears began to trickle down his own cheeks; he came towards her with outstretched arms and fell heavily on his knees. Sobbing, he clasped her to him.

"Forgive me, forgive me," he said. "I promise you it shall not happen again. It was that damned malaria."

"It's so humiliating," she moaned.

He wept like a child. There was something very touching in the self-abasement of that big dignified man. Presently Millicent looked up. His eyes, appealing and contrite, sought hers.

"Will you give me your word of honour that you'll never touch liquor again?"

"Yes, yes. I hate it."

It was then she told him that she was with child. He was overjoyed.

"That is the one thing I wanted. That'll keep me straight."

They went back to the bungalow. Harold bathed himself and had a nap. After dinner they talked long and quietly. He admitted that before he married her he had occasionally drunk more than was good for him; in outstations it was easy to fall into bad habits. He agreed to everything that Millicent asked. And during the months before it was necessary for her to go to Kuala Solor for her confinement, Harold was an excellent husband, tender, thoughtful, proud, and affectionate; he was irreproachable. A launch came to fetch her, she was to leave him for six weeks, and he promised faithfully to drink nothing during her absence. He put his hands on her shoulders.

"I never break a promise," he said in his dignified way. "But even without it, can you imagine that while you are going through so much, I should do anything to increase your troubles?"

Joan was born. Millicent stayed at the Resident's, and Mrs. Gray, his wife, a kindly creature of middle age, was very good to her. The two women had little to do during the long hours they were alone but to talk, and in course of time Millicent learnt everything there was to know of her husband's alcoholic past. The fact which she found most difficult to reconcile herself to was that Harold had been told that the only condition upon which he would be allowed to keep his post was that he should bring back a wife. It caused in her a dull feeling of resentment. And when she discovered what a persistent drunkard he had been, she felt vaguely uneasy. She had a horrid fear that during her absence he would not have been able to resist the craving. She went home with her baby and a nurse. She spent a night at the mouth of the river and sent a messenger in a canoe to announce her arrival. She scanned the landing-stage anxiously as the launch approached it. Harold and Mr. Simpson were standing there. The trim little soldiers were lined up. Her heart sank, for Harold was swaying slightly, like a man who seeks to keep his balance on a rolling ship, and she knew he was drunk.

It wasn't a very pleasant home-coming. She had almost forgotten her mother and father and her sister who sat there silently listening to her. Now she roused herself and became once more aware of their presence. All that she spoke of seemed very far away.

"I knew that I hated him then," she said. "I could have killed him."

"Oh, Millicent, don't say that," cried her mother. "Don't forget that he's dead, poor man."

Millicent looked at her mother, and for a moment a scowl darkened her impassive face. Mr. Skinner moved uneasily.

"Go on," said Kathleen.

"When he found out that I knew all about him he didn't bother very much more. In three months he had another attack of D.T.S."

"Why didn't you leave him?" said Kathleen.

"What would have been the good of that? He would have been dismissed from the service in a fortnight. Who was to keep me and Joan? I had to stay. And when he was sober I had nothing to complain of. He wasn't in the least in love with me, but he was fond of me; I hadn't married him because I was in love with him, but because I wanted to be married. I did everything I could to keep liquor from him; I managed to get Mr. Gray to prevent whisky being sent from Kuala Solor, but he got it from the Chinese. I watched him as a cat watches a mouse. He was too cunning for me. In a little while he had another outbreak. He neglected his duties. I was afraid complaints would be made. We were two days from Kuala Solor and that was our safeguard, but I suppose something was said, for Mr. Gray wrote a private letter of warning to me. I showed it to Harold. He stormed and blustered, but I saw he was frightened, and for two or three months he was quite sober. Then he began again. And so it went on till our leave became due.

"Before we came to stay here I begged and prayed him to be careful. I didn't want any of you to know what sort of a man I had married. All the time he was in England he was all right and before we sailed I warned him. He'd grown to be very fond of Joan, and very proud of her, and she was devoted to him. She always liked him better than she liked me. I asked him if he wanted to have his child grow up, knowing that he was a drunkard, and I found out that at last I'd got a hold on him. The thought terrified him. I told him that I wouldn't allow it, and if he ever let Joan see him drunk I'd take her away from him at once. Do you know, he grew quite pale when I said it. I fell on my knees that night and thanked God, because I'd found a way of saving my husband.

"He told me that if I would stand by him he would have another try. We made up our minds to fight the thing together. And he tried so hard. When he felt as though he must drink he came to me. You know he was inclined to be rather pompous; with me he was so humble, he was like a child; he depended on me. Perhaps he didn't love me when he married me, but he loved me then, me and Joan. I'd hated him, because of the humiliation, because when he was drunk and tried to be dignified and impressive he was loathsome; but now I got a strange feeling in my heart. It wasn't love, but it was a queer, shy tenderness. He was something more than my husband, he was like a child that I'd carried under my heart for long and weary months. He was so proud of me and, you know, I was proud too. His long speeches didn't irritate me any more, and I only thought his stately ways rather funny and charming. At last we won. For two years he never touched a drop. He lost his craving entirely. He was even able to joke about it.

"Mr. Simpson had left us then and we had another young man called Francis.

"'I'm a reformed drunkard, you know, Francis,' Harold said to him once. 'If it hadn't been for my wife I'd have been sacked long ago. I've got the best wife in the world, Francis.'

"You don't know what it meant to me to hear him say that. I felt that all I'd gone through was worth while. I was so happy."

She was silent. She thought of the broad, yellow and turbid river on whose banks she had lived so long. The egrets, white and gleaming in the tremulous sunset, flew down the stream in a flock, flew low and swift, and scattered. They were like a ripple of snowy notes, sweet and pure and spring-like, which an unseen hand drew forth, a divine arpeggio, from an unseen harp. They fluttered along between the green banks, wrapped in the shadows of evening, like the happy thoughts of a contented mind.

"Then Joan fell ill. For three weeks we were very anxious. There was no doctor nearer than Kuala Solor and we had to put up with the treatment of a native dispenser. When she grew well again I took her down to the mouth of the river in order to give her a breath of sea air. We stayed there a week. It was the first time I had been separated from Harold since I went away to have Joan.

"There was a fishing village, on piles, not far from us, but really we were quite alone. I thought a great deal about Harold, so tenderly, and all at once I knew that I loved him. I was so glad when the prahu came to fetch us back, because I wanted to tell him. I thought it would mean a good deal to him. I can't tell you how happy I was. As we rowed up-stream the headman told me that Mr. Francis had had to go up-country to arrest a woman who had murdered her husband. He had been gone a couple of days.

"I was surprised that Harold was not on the landing-stage to meet me; he was always very punctilious about that sort of thing; he used to say that husband and wife should treat one another as politely as they treated acquaintances; and I could not imagine what business had prevented him. I walked up the little hill on which the bungalow stood. The ayah brought Joan behind me. The bungalow was strangely silent. There seemed to be no servants about, and I could not make it out; I wondered if Harold hadn't expected me so soon and was out. I went up the steps. Joan was thirsty and the ayah took her to the servants' quarters to give her something to drink. Harold was not in the sitting-room. I called him, but there was no answer. I was disappointed because I should have liked him to be there. I went into our bedroom. Harold wasn't out after all; he was lying on the bed asleep. I was really very much amused, because he always pretended he never slept in the afternoon. He said it was an unnecessary habit that we white people got into. I went up to the bed softly. I thought I would have a joke with him. I opened the mosquito curtains. He was lying on his back, with nothing on but a sarong, and there was an empty whisky bottle by his side. He was drunk.

"It had begun again. All my struggles for so many years were wasted. My dream was shattered. It was all hopeless. I was seized with rage."

Millicent's face grew once again darkly red and she clenched the arms of the chair she sat in.

"I took him by the shoulders and shook him with all my might. 'You beast,' I cried, 'you beast.' I was so angry I don't know what I did, I don't know what I said. I kept on shaking him. You don't know how loathsome he looked, that large fat man, half naked; he hadn't shaved for days, and his face was bloated and purple. He was breathing heavily. I shouted at him, but he took no notice. I tried to drag him out of bed, but he was too heavy. He lay there like a log. 'Open your eyes,' I screamed. I shook him again. I hated him. I hated him all the more because for a week I'd loved him with all my heart. He'd let me down. He'd let me down. I wanted to tell him what a filthy beast he was. I could make no impression on him. 'You shall open your eyes,' I cried. I was determined to make him look at me."

The widow licked her dry lips. Her breath seemed hurried. She was silent.

"If he was in that state I should have thought it best to have let him go on sleeping," said Kathleen.

"There was a parang on the wall by the side of the bed. You know how fond Harold was of curios."

"What's a parang?" said Mrs. Skinner.

"Don't be silly, mother," her husband replied irritably. "There's one on the wall immediately behind you."

He pointed to the Malay sword on which for some reason his eyes had been unconsciously resting. Mrs. Skinner drew quickly into the corner of the sofa, with a little frightened gesture, as though she had been told that a snake lay curled up beside her.

"Suddenly the blood spurted out from Harold's throat. There was a great red gash right across it."

"Millicent," cried Kathleen, springing up and almost leaping towards her, "what in God's name do you mean?"

Mrs. Skinner stood staring at her with wide startled eyes, her mouth open.

"The parang wasn't on the wall any more. It was on the bed. Then Harold opened his eyes. They were just like Joan's."

"I don't understand," said Mr. Skinner. "How could he have committed suicide if he was in the state you describe?"

Kathleen took her sister's arm and shook her angrily.

"Millicent, for God's sake explain."

Millicent released herself.

"The parang was on the wall, I told you. I don't know what happened. There was all the blood, and Harold opened his eyes. He died almost at once. He never spoke, but he gave a sort of gasp."

At last Mr. Skinner found his voice.

"But, you wretched woman, it was murder."

Millicent, her face mottled with red, gave him such a look of scornful hatred that he shrank back. Mrs. Skinner cried out.

"Millicent, you didn't do it, did you?"

Then Millicent did something that made them all feel as though their blood were turned to ice in their veins. She chuckled.

"I don't know who else did," she said.

"My God," muttered Mr. Skinner.

Kathleen had been standing bolt upright with her hands to her heart, as though its beating were intolerable.

"And what happened then?" she said.

"I screamed. I went to the window and flung it open. I called for the ayah. She came across the compound with Joan. 'Not Joan,' I cried. 'Don't let her come.' She called the cook and told him to take the child. I cried to her to hurry. And when she came I showed her Harold. 'The Tuan's killed himself!' I cried. She gave a scream and ran out of the house.

"No one would come near. They were all frightened out of their wits. I wrote a letter to Mr. Francis, telling him what had happened and asking him to come at once."

"How do you mean you told him what had happened?"

"I said, on my return from the mouth of the river, I'd found Harold with his throat cut. You know, in the tropics you have to bury people quickly. I got a Chinese coffin, and the soldiers dug a grave behind the Fort. When Mr. Francis came, Harold had been buried for nearly two days. He was only a boy. I could do anything I wanted with him. I told him I'd found the parang in Harold's hand and there was no doubt he'd killed himself in an attack of delirium tremens. I showed him the empty bottle. The servants said he'd been drinking hard ever since I left to go to the sea. I told the same story at Kuala Solor. Everyone was very kind to me, and the government granted me a pension."

For a little while nobody spoke. At last Mr. Skinner gathered himself together.

"I am a member of the legal profession. I'm a solicitor. I have certain duties. We've always had a most respectable practice. You've put me in a monstrous position."

He fumbled, searching for the phrases that played at hide and seek in his scattered wits. Millicent looked at him with scorn.

"What are you going to do about it?"

"It was murder, that's what it was; do you think I can possibly connive at it?"

"Don't talk nonsense, father," said Kathleen sharply. "You can't give up your own daughter."

"You've put me in a monstrous position," he repeated.

Millicent shrugged her shoulders again.

"You made me tell you. And I've borne it long enough by myself. It was time that all of you bore it too."

At that moment the door was opened by the maid.

"Davis has brought the car round, sir," she said.

Kathleen had the presence of mind to say something, and the maid withdrew.

"We'd better be starting," said Millicent.

"I can't go to the party now," cried Mrs. Skinner, with horror. "I'm far too upset. How can we face the Heywoods? And the Bishop will want to be introduced to you."

Millicent made a gesture of indifference. Her eyes held their ironical expression.

"We must go, mother," said Kathleen. "It would look so funny if we stayed away." She turned on Millicent furiously. "Oh, I think the whole thing is such frightfully bad form."

Mrs. Skinner looked helplessly at her husband. He went to her and gave her his hand to help her up from the sofa.

"I'm afraid we must go, mother," he said.

"And me with the ospreys in my toque that Harold gave me with his own hands," she moaned.

He led her out of the room, Kathleen followed close on their heels, and a step or two behind came Millicent.

"You'll get used to it, you know," she said quietly. "At first I thought of it all the time, but now I forget it for two or three days together. It's not as if there was any danger."

They did not answer. They walked through the hall and out of the front door. The three ladies got into the back of the car and Mr. Skinner seated himself beside the driver. They had no self-starter; it was an old car, and Davis went to the bonnet to crank it up. Mr. Skinner turned round and looked petulantly at Millicent.

"I ought never to have been told," he said. "I think it was most selfish of you."

Davis took his seat and they drove off to the Canon's garden-party.





Jane


I remember very well the occasion on which I first saw Jane Fowler. It is indeed only because the details of the glimpse I had of her then are so clear that I trust my recollection at all, for, looking back, I must confess that I find it hard to believe that it has not played me a fantastic trick. I had lately returned to London from China and was drinking a dish of tea with Mrs. Tower. Mrs. Tower had been seized with the prevailing passion for decoration; and with the ruthlessness of her sex had sacrificed chairs in which she had comfortably sat for years, tables, cabinets, ornaments on which her eyes had dwelt in peace since she was married, pictures that had been familiar to her for a generation; and delivered herself into the hands of an expert. Nothing remained in her drawing-room with which she had any association, or to which any sentiment was attached; and she had invited me that day to see the fashionable glory in which she now lived. Everything that could be pickled was pickled and what couldn't be pickled was painted. Nothing matched, but everything harmonized.

"Do you remember that ridiculous drawing-room suite that I used to have?" asked Mrs. Tower.

The curtains were sumptuous yet severe; the sofa was covered with Italian brocade; the chair on which I sat was in petit point. The room was beautiful, opulent without garishness, and original without affectation; yet to me it lacked something; and while I praised with my lips I asked myself why I so much preferred the rather shabby chintz of the despised suite, the Victorian watercolours that I had known so long, and the ridiculous Dresden china that had adorned the chimney-piece. I wondered what it was that I missed in all these rooms that the decorators were turning out with a profitable industry. Was it heart? But Mrs. Tower looked about her happily.

"Don't you like my alabaster lamps?" she said. "They give such a soft light."

"Personally I have a weakness for a light that you can see by," I smiled.

"It's so difficult to combine that with a light that you can't be too much seen by," laughed Mrs. Tower.

I had no notion what her age was. When I was quite a young man she was a married woman a good deal older than I, but now she treated me as her contemporary. She constantly said that she made no secret of her age, which was forty, and then added with a smile that all women took five years off. She never sought to conceal the fact that she dyed her hair (it was a very pretty brown with reddish tints), and she said she did this because hair was hideous while it was going grey; as soon as hers was white she would cease to dye it.

"Then they'll say what a young face I have."

Meanwhile it was painted, though with discretion, and her eyes owed not a little of their vivacity to art. She was a handsome woman, exquisitely gowned, and in the sombre glow of the alabaster lamps did not look a day more than the forty she gave herself.

"It is only at my dressing-table that I can suffer the naked brightness of a thirty-two-candle electric bulb," she added with smiling cynicism. "There I need it to tell me the first hideous truth and then to enable me to take the necessary steps to correct it."

We gossiped pleasantly about our common friends and Mrs. Tower brought me up to date in the scandal of the day. After roughing it here and there it was very agreeable to sit in a comfortable chair, the fire burning brightly on the hearth, charming tea-things set out on a charming table, and talk with this amusing, attractive woman. She treated me as a prodigal returned from his husks and was disposed to make much of me. She prided herself on her dinnerparties; she took no less trouble to have her guests suitably assorted than to give them excellent food; and there were few persons who did not look upon it as a treat to be bidden to one of them. Now she fixed a date and asked me whom I would like to meet.

"There's only one thing I must tell you. If Jane Fowler is still here I shall have to put it off."

"Who is Jane Fowler?" I asked.

Mrs. Tower gave a rueful smile.

"Jane Fowler is my cross."

"Oh!"

"Do you remember a photograph that I used to have on the piano before I had my room done, of a woman in a tight dress with tight sleeves and a gold locket, with her hair drawn back from a broad forehead and her ears showing and spectacles on a rather blunt nose? Well, that was Jane Fowler."

"You had so many photographs about the room in your unregenerate days," I said, vaguely.

"It makes me shudder to think of them. I've made them into a huge brown-paper parcel and hidden them in an attic"

"Well, who is Jane Fowler?" I asked again, smiling.

"She's my sister-in-law. She was my husband's sister and she married a manufacturer in the North. She's been a widow for many years, and she's very well-to-do."

"And why is she your cross?"

"She's worthy, she's dowdy, she's provincial. She looks twenty years older than I do and she's quite capable of telling anyone she meets that we were at school together. She has an overwhelming sense of family affection and because I am her only living connexion she's devoted to me. When she comes to London it never occurs to her that she should stay anywhere but here—she thinks it would hurt my feelings—and she'll pay me visits of three or four weeks. We sit here and she knits and reads. And sometimes she insists on taking me to dine at Claridge's and she looks like a funny old charwoman and everyone I particularly don't want to be seen by is sitting at the next table. When we are driving home she says she loves giving me a little treat. With her own hands she makes me tea-cosies that I am forced to use when she is here and doilies and centrepieces for the dining-room table."

Mrs. Tower paused to take breath.

"I should have thought a woman of your tact would find a way to deal with a situation like that."

"Ah, but don't you see, I haven't a chance. She's so immeasurably kind. She has a heart of gold. She bores me to death, but I wouldn't for anything let her suspect it."

"And when does she arrive?"

"Tomorrow."

But the answer was hardly out of Mrs. Tower's mouth when the bell rang. There were sounds in the hall of a slight commotion and in a minute or two the butler ushered in an elderly lady.

"Mrs. Fowler," he announced.

"Jane," cried Mrs. Tower, springing to her feet. "I wasn't expecting you today."

"So your butler has just told me. I certainly said today in my letter."

Mrs. Tower recovered her wits.

"Well, it doesn't matter. I'm very glad to see you whenever you come. Fortunately I'm doing nothing this evening."

"You mustn't let me give you any trouble. If I can have a boiled egg for my dinner, that's all I shall want."

A faint grimace for a moment distorted Mrs. Tower's handsome features. A boiled egg!

"Oh, I think we can do a little better than that."

I chuckled inwardly when I recollected that the two ladies were contemporaries. Mrs. Fowler looked a good fifty-five. She was a rather big woman; she wore a black straw hat with a wide brim and from it a black lace veil hung over her shoulders, a cloak that oddly combined severity with fussiness, a long black dress, voluminous as though she wore several petticoats under it, and stout boots. She was evidently short-sighted, for she looked at you through large gold-rimmed spectacles.

"Won't you have a cup of tea?" asked Mrs. Tower.

"If it wouldn't be too much trouble. I'll take off my mantle."

She began by stripping her hands of the black gloves she wore, and then took off her cloak. Round her neck was a solid gold chain from which hung a large gold locket in which I felt certain was a photograph of her deceased husband. Then she took off her hat and placed it neatly with her gloves and cloak on the sofa corner. Mrs. Tower pursed her lips. Certainly those garments did not go very well with the austere but sumptuous beauty of Mrs. Tower's redecorated drawing-room. I wondered where on earth Mrs. Fowler had found the extraordinary clothes she wore. They were not old and the materials were expensive. It was astounding to think that dressmakers still made things that had not been worn for a quarter of a century. Mrs. Fowler's grey hair was very plainly done, showing all her forehead and her ears, with a parting in the middle. It had evidently never known the tongs of Monsieur Marcel. Now her eyes fell on the tea-table with its teapot of Georgian silver and its cups in Old Worcester.

"What have you done with the tea-cosy I gave you last time I came up, Marion?" she asked. "Don't you use it?"

"Yes, I used it every day, Jane," answered Mrs. Tower glibly. "Unfortunately we had an accident with it a little while ago. It got burnt."

"But the last one I gave you got burnt."

"I'm afraid you'll think us very careless."

"It doesn't really matter," smiled Mrs. Fowler. "I shall enjoy making you another. I'll go to Liberty's tomorrow and buy some silks."

Mrs. Tower kept her face bravely.

"I don't deserve it, you know. Doesn't your vicar's wife need one?"

"Oh, I've just made her one," said Mrs. Fowler brightly.

I noticed that when she smiled she showed white, small, and regular teeth. They were a real beauty. Her smile was certainly very sweet.

But I felt it high time for me to leave the two ladies to themselves, so I took my leave.

Early next morning Mrs. Tower rang me up and I heard at once from her voice that she was in high spirits.

"I've got the most wonderful news for you," she said. "Jane is going to be married."

"Nonsense."

"Her fiancé is coming to dine here tonight to be introduced to me and I want you to come too."

"Oh, but I shall be in the way."

"No, you won't. Jane suggested herself that I should ask you. Do come."

She was bubbling over with laughter.

"Who is he?"

"I don't know. She tells me he's an architect. Can you imagine the sort of man Jane would marry?"

I had nothing to do and I could trust Mrs. Tower to give me a good dinner.

When I arrived Mrs. Tower, very splendid in a tea-gown a little too young for her, was alone.

"Jane is putting the finishing touches to her appearance. I'm longing for you to see her. She's all in a flutter. She says he adores her. His name is Gilbert and when she speaks of him her voice gets all funny and tremulous. It makes me want to laugh."

"I wonder what he's like."

"Oh, I'm sure I know. Very big and massive, with a bald head and an immense gold chain across an immense tummy. A large, fat, clean-shaven, red face and a booming voice."

Mrs. Fowler came in. She wore a very stiff black silk dress with a wide skirt and a train. At the neck it was cut into a timid V and the sleeves came down to the elbows. She wore a necklace of diamonds set in silver. She carried in her hands a long pair of black gloves and a fan of black ostrich feathers. She managed (as so few people do) to look exactly what she was. You could never have thought her anything in the world but the respectable relict of a North-country manufacturer of ample means.

"You've really got quite a pretty neck, Jane," said Mrs. Tower with a kindly smile.

It was indeed astonishingly young when you compared it with her weather-beaten face. It was smooth and unlined and the skin was white. And I noticed then that her head was very well placed on her shoulders.

"Has Marion told you my news?" she said, turning to me with that really charming smile of hers as if we were already old friends.

"I must congratulate you," I said.

"Wait to do that till you've seen my young man."

"I think it's too sweet to hear you talk of your young man," smiled Mrs. Tower.

Mrs. Fowler's eyes certainly twinkled behind her preposterous spectacles.

"Don't expect anyone too old. You wouldn't like me to marry a decrepit old gentleman with one foot in the grave, would you?"

This was the only warning she gave us. Indeed there was no time for any further discussion, for the butler flung open the door and in a loud voice announced:

"Mr. Gilbert Napier."

There entered a youth in a very well-cut dinner jacket. He was slight, not very tall, with fair hair in which there was a hint of a natural wave, cleanshaven, and blue-eyed. He was not particularly good-looking, but he had a pleasant, amiable face. In ten years he would probably be wizened and sallow; but now, in extreme youth, he was fresh and clean and blooming. For he was certainly not more than twenty-four. My first thought was that this was the son of Jane Fowler's fiancé (I had not known he was a widower) come to say that his father was prevented from dining by a sudden attack of gout. But his eyes fell immediately on Mrs. Fowler, his face lit up, and he went towards her with both hands outstretched. Mrs. Fowler gave him hers, a demure smile on her lips, and turned to her sister-in-law.

"This is my young man, Marion," she said.

He held out his hand.

"I hope you'll like me, Mrs. Tower," he said. "Jane tells me you're the only relation she has in the world."

Mrs. Tower's face was wonderful to behold. I saw then to admiration how bravely good breeding and social usage could combat the instincts of the natural woman. For the astonishment and then the dismay that for an instant she could not conceal were quickly driven away, and her face assumed an expression of affable welcome. But she was evidently at a loss for words. It was not unnatural if Gilbert felt a certain embarrassment and I was too busy preventing myself from laughing to think of anything to say. Mrs. Fowler alone kept perfectly calm.

"I know you'll like him, Marion. There's no one enjoys good food more than he does." She turned to the young man. "Marion's dinners are famous."

"I know," he beamed.

Mrs. Tower made some quick rejoinder and we went downstairs. I shall not soon forget the exquisite comedy of that meal. Mrs. Tower could not make up her mind whether the pair of them were playing a practical joke on her or whether Jane by wilfully concealing her fiancé's age had hoped to make her look foolish. But then Jane never jested and she was incapable of doing a malicious thing. Mrs. Tower was amazed, exasperated, and perplexed. But she had recovered her self-control, and for nothing would she have forgotten that she was a perfect hostess whose duty it was to make her party go. She talked vivaciously; but I wondered if Gilbert Napier saw how hard and vindictive was the expression of her eyes behind the mask of friendliness that she turned to him. She was measuring him. She was seeking to delve into the secret of his soul. I could see that she was in a passion, for under her rouge her cheeks glowed with an angry red.

"You've got a very high colour, Marion," said Jane, looking at her amiably through her great round spectacles.

"I dressed in a hurry. I dare say I put on too much rouge."

"Oh, is it rouge? I thought it was natural. Otherwise I shouldn't have mentioned it." She gave Gilbert a shy little smile. "You know, Marion and I were at school together. You would never think it to look at us now, would you? But of course I've lived a very quiet life."

I do not know what she meant by these remarks; it was almost incredible that she made them in complete simplicity; but anyhow they goaded Mrs. Tower to such a fury that she flung her own vanity to the winds. She smiled brightly.

"We shall neither of us see fifty again, Jane," she said.

If the observation was meant to discomfit the widow it failed.

"Gilbert says I mustn't acknowledge to more than forty-nine for his sake," she answered blandly.

Mrs. Tower's hands trembled slightly, but she found a retort.

"There is of course a certain disparity of age between you," she smiled.

"Twenty-seven years," said Jane. "Do you think it's too much? Gilbert says I'm very young for my age. I told you I shouldn't like to marry a man with one foot in the grave."

I was really obliged to laugh and Gilbert laughed too. His laughter was frank and boyish. It looked as though he were amused at everything Jane said. But Mrs. Tower was almost at the end of her tether and I was afraid that unless relief came she would for once forget that she was a woman of the world. I came to the rescue as best I could.

"I suppose you're very busy buying your trousseau," I said.

"No. I wanted to get my things from the dressmaker in Liverpool I've been to ever since I was first married. But Gilbert won't let me. He's very masterful, and of course he has wonderful taste."

She looked at him with a little affectionate smile, demurely, as though she were a girl of seventeen.

Mrs. Tower went quite pale under her make-up.

"We're going to Italy for our honeymoon. Gilbert has never had a chance of studying Renaissance architecture and of course it's important for an architect to see things for himself. And we shall stop in Paris on the way and get my clothes there."

"Do you expect to be away long?"

"Gilbert has arranged with his office to stay away for six months. It will be such a treat for him, won't it? You see, he's never had more than a fortnight's holiday before."

"Why not?" asked Mrs. Tower in a tone that no effort of will could prevent from being icy.

"He's never been able to afford it, poor dear."

"Ah!" said Mrs. Tower, and into the exclamation put volumes.

Coffee was served and the ladies went upstairs. Gilbert and I began to talk in the desultory way in which men talk who have nothing whatever to say to one another; but in two minutes a note was brought in to me by the butler. It was from Mrs. Tower and ran as follows:





Come upstairs quickly and then go as soon as you can. Take him with you. Unless I have it out with Jane at once I shall have a fit.





I told a facile lie.

"Mrs. Tower has a headache and wants to go to bed. I think if you don't mind we'd better clear out."

"Certainly," he answered.

We went upstairs and five minutes later were on the doorstep. I called a taxi and offered the young man a lift.

"No, thanks," he answered. "I'll just walk to the corner and jump on a bus."

Mrs. Tower sprang to the fray as soon as she heard the front door close behind us.

"Are you crazy, Jane?" she cried.

"Not more than most people who don't habitually live in a lunatic asylum, I trust," Jane answered blandly.

"May I ask why you're going to marry this young man?" asked Mrs. Tower with formidable politeness.

"Partly because he won't take no for an answer. He's asked me five times. I grew positively tired of refusing him."

"And why do you think he's so anxious to marry you?"

"I amuse him."

Mrs. Tower gave an exclamation of annoyance.

"He's an unscrupulous rascal. I very nearly told him so to his face."

"You would have been wrong, and it wouldn't have been very polite."

"He's penniless and you're rich. You can't be such a besotted fool as not to see that he's marrying you for your money."

Jane remained perfectly composed. She observed her sister-in-law's agitation with detachment.

"I don't think he is, you know," she replied. "I think he's very fond of me."

"You're an old woman, Jane."

"I'm the same age as you are, Marion," she smiled.

"I've never let myself go. I'm very young for my age. No one would think I was more than forty. But even I wouldn't dream of marrying a boy twenty years younger than myself."

"Twenty-seven," corrected Jane.

"Do you mean to tell me that you can bring yourself to believe that it's possible for a young man to care for a woman old enough to be his mother?"

"I've lived very much in the country for many years. I dare say there's a great deal about human nature that I don't know. They tell me there's a man called Freud, an Austrian, I believe . . ."

But Mrs. Tower interrupted her without any politeness at all.

"Don't be ridiculous, Jane. It's so undignified. It's so ungraceful. I always thought you were a sensible woman. Really you're the last person I should ever have thought likely to fall in love with a boy."

"But I'm not in love with him. I've told him that. Of course I like him very much or I wouldn't think of marrying him. I thought it only fair to tell him quite plainly what my feelings were towards him."

Mrs. Tower gasped. The blood rushed to her head and her breathing oppressed her. She had no fan, but she seized the evening paper and vigorously fanned herself with it.

"If you're not in love with him why do you want to marry him?"

"I've been a widow a very long time and I've led a very quiet life. I thought I'd like a change."

"If you want to marry just to be married why don't you marry a man of your own age?"

"No man of my own age has asked me five times. In fact no man of my own age has asked me at all."

Jane chuckled as she answered. It drove Mrs. Tower to the final pitch of frenzy.

"Don't laugh, Jane, I won't have it. I don't think you can be right in your mind. It's dreadful."

It was altogether too much for her and she burst into tears. She knew that at her age it was fatal to cry, her eyes would be swollen for twenty-four hours and she would look a sight. But there was no help for it. She wept. Jane remained perfectly calm. She looked at Marion through her large spectacles and reflectively smoothed the lap of her black silk dress.

"You're going to be so dreadfully unhappy," Mrs. Tower sobbed, dabbing her eyes cautiously in the hope that the black on her lashes would not smudge.

"I don't think so, you know," Jane answered in those equable, mild tones of hers, as if there were a little smile behind the words. "We've talked it over very thoroughly. I always think I'm a very easy person to live with. I think I shall make Gilbert very happy and comfortable. He's never had anyone to look after him properly. We're only marrying after mature consideration. And we've decided that if either of us wants his liberty the other will place no obstacles in the way of his getting it."

Mrs. Tower had by now recovered herself sufficiently to make a cutting remark.

"How much has he persuaded you to settle on him?"

"I wanted to settle a thousand a year on him, but he wouldn't hear of it. He was quite upset when I made the suggestion. He says he can earn quite enough for his own needs."

"He's more cunning than I thought," said Mrs. Tower acidly.

Jane paused a little and looked at her sister-in-law with kindly but resolute eyes.

"You see, my dear, it's different for you," she said. "You've never been so very much a widow, have you?"

Mrs. Tower looked at her. She blushed a little. She even felt slightly uncomfortable. But of course Jane was much too simple to intend an innuendo. Mrs. Tower gathered herself together with dignity.

"I'm so upset that I really must go to bed," she said. "We'll resume the conversation tomorrow morning."

"I'm afraid that won't be very convenient, dear. Gilbert and I are going to get the licence tomorrow morning."

Mrs. Tower threw up her hands in a gesture of dismay, but she found nothing more to say.

The marriage took place at a registrar's office. Mrs. Tower and I were the witnesses. Gilbert in a smart blue suit looked absurdly young and he was obviously nervous. It is a trying moment for any man. But Jane kept her admirable composure. She might have been in the habit of marrying as frequently as a woman of fashion. Only a slight colour on her cheeks suggested that beneath her calm was some faint excitement. It is a thrilling moment for any woman. She wore a very full dress of silvery grey velvet in the cut of which I recognized the hand of the dressmaker in Liverpool (evidently a widow of unimpeachable character) who had made her gowns for so many years; but she had so far succumbed to the frivolity of the occasion as to wear a large picture hat covered with blue ostrich feathers. Her gold-rimmed spectacles made it extraordinarily grotesque.

When the ceremony was over the registrar (somewhat taken aback, I thought, by the difference of age between the pair he was marrying) shook hands with her, tendering his strictly official congratulations; and the bridegroom, blushing slightly, kissed her. Mrs. Tower, resigned but implacable, kissed her; and then the bride looked at me expectantly. It was evidently fitting that I should kiss her too. I did. I confess that I felt a little shy as we walked out of the registrar's office past loungers who waited cynically to see the bridal pairs, and it was with relief that I stepped into Mrs. Tower's car. We drove to Victoria Station, for the happy couple were to go over to Paris by the two o'clock train, and Jane had insisted that the wedding-breakfast should be eaten at the station restaurant. She said it always made her nervous not to be on the platform in good time. Mrs. Tower, present only from a strong sense of family duty, was able to do little to make the party go off well; she ate nothing (for which I could not blame her, since the food was execrable, and anyway I hate champagne at luncheon) and talked in a strained voice. But Jane went through the menu conscientiously.

"I always think one should make a hearty meal before starting out on a journey," she said.

We saw them off, and I drove Mrs. Tower back to her house.

"How long do you give it?" she said. "Six months?"

"Let's hope for the best," I smiled.

"Don't be so absurd. There can be no 'best'. You don't think he's marrying her for anything but her money, do you? Of course it can't last. My only hope is that she won't have to go through as much suffering as she deserves."

I laughed. The charitable words were spoken in such a tone as to leave me in small doubt of Mrs. Tower's meaning.

"Well, if it doesn't last you'll have the consolation of saying: 'I told you so,'" I said.

"I promise you I'll never do that."

"Then you'll have the satisfaction of congratulating yourself on your self-control in not saying: 'I told you so.'"

"She's old and dowdy and dull."

"Are you sure she's dull?" I said. "It's true she doesn't say very much, but when she says anything it's very much to the point."

"I've never heard her make a joke in my life."





I was once more in the Far East when Gilbert and Jane returned from their honeymoon and this time I remained away for nearly two years. Mrs. Tower was a bad correspondent and though I sent her an occasional picture-postcard I received no news from her. But I met her within a week of my return to London; I was dining out and found that I was seated next to her. It was an immense party, I think we were four-and-twenty, like the blackbirds in the pie, and, arriving somewhat late, I was too confused by the crowd in which I found myself to notice who was there. But when we sat down, looking round the long table I saw that a good many of my fellow-guests were well known to the public from their photographs in the illustrated papers. Our hostess had a weakness for the persons technically known as celebrities and this was an unusually brilliant gathering.

When Mrs. Tower and I had exchanged the conventional remarks that two people make when they have not seen one another for a couple of years I asked about Jane.

"She's very well," said Mrs. Tower with a certain dryness.

"How has the marriage turned out?"

Mrs. Tower paused a little and took a salted almond from the dish in front of her.

"It appears to be quite a success."

"You were wrong then?"

"I said it wouldn't last and I still say it won't last. It's contrary to human nature."

"Is she happy?"

"They're both happy."

"I suppose you don't see very much of them."

"At first I saw quite a lot of them. But now . . ." Mrs. Tower pursed her lips a little. "Jane is becoming very grand."

"What do you mean?" I laughed.

"I think I should tell you that she's here tonight."

"Here?"

I was startled. I looked round the table again. Our hostess was a delightful and an entertaining woman, but I could not imagine that she would be likely to invite to a dinner such as this the elderly and dowdy wife of an obscure architect. Mrs. Tower saw my perplexity and was shrewd enough to see what was in my mind. She smiled thinly.

"Look on the left of our host."

I looked. Oddly enough the woman who sat there had by her fantastic appearance attracted my attention the moment I was ushered into the crowded drawing-room. I thought I noticed a gleam of recognition in her eye, but to the best of my belief I had never seen her before. She was not a young woman, for her hair was iron-grey; it was cut very short and clustered thickly round her well-shaped head in tight curls. She made no attempt at youth, for she was conspicuous in that gathering by using neither lipstick, rouge, nor powder. Her face, not a particularly handsome one, was red and weather-beaten; but because it owed nothing to artifice had a naturalness that was very pleasing. It contrasted oddly with the whiteness of her shoulders. They were really magnificent. A woman of thirty might have been proud of them. But her dress was extraordinary. I had not often seen anything more audacious. It was cut very low, with short skirts, which were then the fashion, in black and yellow; it had almost the effect of fancy-dress and yet so became her that though on anyone else it would have been outrageous, on her it had the inevitable simplicity of nature. And to complete the impression of an eccentricity in which there was no pose and of an extravagance in which there was no ostentation she wore, attached by a broad black ribbon, a single eyeglass.

"You're not going to tell me that is your sister-in-law," I gasped.

"That is Jane Napier," said Mrs. Tower icily.

At that moment she was speaking. Her host was turned towards her with an anticipatory smile. A baldish white-haired man, with a sharp, intelligent face, who sat on her left, was leaning forward eagerly, and the couple who sat opposite, ceasing to talk with one another, listened intently. She said her say and they all, with a sudden movement, threw themselves back in their chairs and burst into vociferous laughter. From the other side of the table a man addressed Mrs. Tower: I recognized a famous statesman.

"Your sister-in-law has made another joke, Mrs. Tower," he said.

Mrs. Tower smiled.

"She's priceless, isn't she?"

"Let me have a long drink of champagne and then for heaven's sake tell me all about it," I said.

Well, this is how I gathered it had all happened. At the beginning of their honeymoon Gilbert took Jane to various dressmakers in Paris and he made no objection to her choosing a number of "gowns" after her own heart; but he persuaded her to have a "frock" or two made according to his own design. It appeared that he had a knack for that kind of work. He engaged a smart French maid. Jane had never had such a thing before. She did her own mending and when she wanted "doing up" was in the habit of ringing for the housemaid. The dresses Gilbert had devised were very different from anything she had worn before; but he had been careful not to go too far too quickly, and because it pleased him she persuaded herself, though not without misgivings, to wear them in preference to those she had chosen herself. Of course she could not wear them with the voluminous petticoats she had been in the habit of using, and these, though it cost her an anxious moment, she discarded.

"Now if you please," said Mrs. Tower, with something very like a sniff of disapproval, "she wears nothing but thin silk tights. It's a wonder to me she doesn't catch her death of cold at her age."

Gilbert and the French maid taught her how to wear her clothes, and, unexpectedly enough, she was very quick at learning. The French maid was in raptures over Madame's arms and shoulders. It was a scandal not to show anything so fine.

"Wait a little, Alphonsine," said Gilbert. "The next lot of clothes I design for Madame we'll make the most of her."

The spectacles of course were dreadful. No one could look really well in gold-rimmed spectacles. Gilbert tried some with tortoiseshell rims. He shook his head.

"They'd look all right on a girl," he said. "You're too old to wear spectacles, Jane." Suddenly he had an inspiration. "By George, I've got it. You must wear an eyeglass."

"Oh, Gilbert, I couldn't."

She looked at him and his excitement, the excitement of the artist, made her smile. He was so sweet to her she wanted to do what she could to please him.

"I'll try," she said.

When they went to an optician and, suited with the right size, she placed an eyeglass jauntily in her eye Gilbert clapped his hands. There and then, before the astonished shopman, he kissed her on both cheeks.

"You look wonderful," he cried.

So they went down to Italy and spent happy months studying Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Jane not only grew accustomed to her changed appearance, but found she liked it. At first she was a little shy when she went into the dining-room of an hotel and people turned round to stare at her, no one had ever raised an eyelid to look at her before, but presently she found that the sensation was not disagreeable. Ladies came up to her and asked her where she got her dress.

"Do you like it?" she answered demurely. "My husband designed it for me."

"I should like to copy it if you don't mind."

Jane had certainly for many years lived a very quiet life, but she was by no means lacking in the normal instincts of her sex. She had her answer ready.

"I'm so sorry, but my husband's very particular and he won't hear of anyone copying my frocks. He wants me to be unique."

She had an idea that people would laugh when she said this, but they didn't; they merely answered:

"Oh, of course I quite understand. You are unique."

But she saw them making mental notes of what she wore, and for some reason this quite "put her about". For once in her life that she wasn't wearing what everybody else did, she reflected, she didn't see why everybody else should want to wear what she did.

"Gilbert," said she, quite sharply for her, "next time you're designing dresses for me I wish you'd design things that people can't copy."

"The only way to do that is to design things that only you can wear."

"Can't you do that?"

"Yes, if you'll do something for me."

"What is it?"

"Cut off your hair."

I think this was the first time that Jane jibbed. Her hair was long and thick and as a girl she had been quite vain of it; to cut it off was a very drastic proceeding. This really was burning her boats behind her. In her case it was not the first step that cost so much, it was the last; but she took it ("I know Marion will think me a perfect fool, and I shall never be able to go to Liverpool again," she said), and when they passed through Paris on their way home Gilbert led her (she felt quite sick, her heart was beating so fast) to the best hairdresser in the world. She came out of this shop with a jaunty, saucy, impudent head of crisp grey curls. Pygmalion had finished his fantastic masterpiece: Galatea was come to life.

"Yes," I said, "but that isn't enough to explain why Jane is here tonight amid this crowd of duchesses, Cabinet Ministers, and suchlike; nor why she is sitting on one side of her host with an Admiral of the Fleet on the other."

"Jane is a humorist," said Mrs. Tower. "Didn't you see them all laughing at what she said?"

There was no doubt now of the bitterness in Mrs. Tower's heart.

"When Jane wrote and told me they were back from their honeymoon I thought I must ask them both to dinner. I didn't much like the idea, but I felt it had to be done. I knew the party would be deadly and I wasn't going to sacrifice any of the people who really mattered. On the other hand I didn't want Jane to think I hadn't any nice friends. You know I never have more than eight, but on this occasion I thought it would make things go better if I had twelve. I'd been too busy to see Jane until the evening of the party. She kept us all waiting a little—that was Gilbert's cleverness—and at last she sailed in. You could have knocked me down with a feather. She made the rest of the women look dowdy and provincial. She made me feel like a painted old trollop."

Mrs. Tower drank a little champagne.

"I wish I could describe the frock to you. It would have been quite impossible on anyone else; on her it was perfect. And the eyeglass! I'd known her for thirty-five years and I'd never seen her without spectacles."

"But you knew she had a good figure."

"How should I? I'd never seen her except in the clothes you first saw her in. Did you think she had a good figure? She seemed not to be unconscious of the sensation she made but to take it as a matter of course. I thought of my dinner and I heaved a sigh of relief. Even if she was a little heavy in hand, with that appearance it didn't so very much matter. She was sitting at the other end of the table and I heard a good deal of laughter. I was glad to think that the other people were playing up well; but after dinner I was a good deal taken aback when no less than three men came up to me and told me that my sister-in-law was priceless, and did I think she would allow them to call on her? I didn't quite know whether I was standing on my head or my heels. Twenty-four hours later our hostess of tonight rang me up and said she had heard my sister-in-law was in London and she was priceless and would I ask her to luncheon to meet her? She has an infallible instinct, that woman: in a month everyone was talking about Jane. I am here tonight, not because I've known our hostess for twenty years and have asked her to dinner a hundred times, but because I'm Jane's sister-in-law."

Poor Mrs. Tower. The position was galling, and though I could not help being amused, for the tables were turned on her with a vengeance, I felt that she deserved my sympathy.

"People never can resist those who make them laugh," I said, trying to console her.

"She never makes me laugh."

Once more from the top of the table I heard a guffaw and guessed that Jane had said another amusing thing.

"Do you mean to say that you are the only person who doesn't think her funny?" I asked, smiling.

"Had it struck you that she was a humorist?"

"I'm bound to say it hadn't."

"She says just the same things as she's said for the last thirty-five years, I laugh when I see everyone else does because I don't want to seem a perfect fool, but I am not amused."

"Like Queen Victoria," I said.

It was a foolish jest and Mrs. Tower was quite right sharply to tell me so. I tried another tack.

"Is Gilbert here?" I asked, looking down the table.

"Gilbert was asked because she won't go out without him, but tonight he's at a dinner of the Architects' Institute or whatever it's called."

"I'm dying to renew my acquaintance with her."

"Go and talk to her after dinner. She'll ask you to her Tuesdays."

"Her Tuesdays?"

"She's at home every Tuesday evening. You'll meet there everyone you ever heard of. They're the best parties in London. She's done in one year what I've failed to do in twenty."

"But what you tell me is really miraculous. How has it been done?"

Mrs. Tower shrugged her handsome but adipose shoulders.

"I shall be glad if you'll tell me," she replied.

After dinner I tried to make my way to the sofa on which Jane was sitting, but I was intercepted and it was not till a little later that my hostess came up to me and said:

"I must introduce you to the star of my party. Do you know Jane Napier? She's priceless. She's much more amusing than your comedies."

I was taken up to the sofa. The admiral who had been sitting beside her at dinner was with her still. He showed no sign of moving and Jane, shaking hands with me, introduced me to him.

"Do you know Sir Reginald Frobisher?"

We began to chat. It was the same Jane as I had known before, perfectly simple, homely and unaffected, but her fantastic appearance certainly gave a peculiar savour to what she said. Suddenly I found myself shaking with laughter. She had made a remark, sensible and to the point, but not in the least witty, which her manner of saying and the bland look she gave me through her eyeglass made perfectly irresistible. I felt light-hearted and buoyant. When I left her she said to me:

"If you've got nothing better to do, come and see us on Tuesday evening. Gilbert will be so glad to see you."

"When he's been a month in London he'll know that he can have nothing better to do," said the admiral.

So, on Tuesday but rather late, I went to Jane's. I confess I was a little surprised at the company. It was quite a remarkable collection of writers, painters and politicians, actors, great ladies and great beauties: Mrs. Tower was right, it was a grand party; I had seen nothing like it in London since Stafford House was sold. No particular entertainment was provided. The refreshments were adequate without being luxurious. Jane in her quiet way seemed to be enjoying herself; I could not see that she took a great deal of trouble with her guests, but they seemed to like being there and the gay, pleasant party did not break up till two in the morning. After that I saw much of her. I not only went often to her house, but seldom went out to luncheon or to dinner without meeting her. I am an amateur of humour and I sought to discover in what lay her peculiar gift. It was impossible to repeat anything she said, for the fun, like certain wines, would not travel. She had no gift for epigram. She never made a brilliant repartee. There was no malice in her remarks nor sting in her rejoinders. There are those who think that impropriety, rather than brevity, is the soul of wit; but she never said a thing that could have brought a blush to a Victorian cheek. I think her humour was unconscious and I am sure it was unpremeditated. It flew like a butterfly from flower to flower, obedient only to its own caprice and pursuivant of neither method nor intention. It depended on the way she spoke and on the way she looked. Its subtlety gained by the flaunting and extravagant appearance that Gilbert had achieved for her; but her appearance was only an element in it. Now of course she was the fashion and people laughed if she but opened her mouth. They no longer wondered that Gilbert had married a wife so much older than himself. They saw that Jane was a woman with whom age did not count. They thought him a devilish lucky young fellow. The admiral quoted Shakespeare to me: "Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety." Gilbert was delighted with her success. As I came to know him better I grew to like him. It was quite evident that he was neither a rascal nor a fortune-hunter. He was not only immensely proud of Jane but genuinely devoted to her. His kindness to her was touching. He was a very unselfish and sweet-tempered young man.

"Well, what do you think of Jane now?" he said to me once, with boyish triumph.

"I don't know which of you is more wonderful," I said. "You or she."

"Oh, I'm nothing."

"Nonsense. You don't think I'm such a fool as not to see that it's you, and you only, who've made Jane what she is."

"My only merit is that I saw what was there when it wasn't obvious to the naked eye," he answered.

"I can understand your seeing that she had in her the possibility of that remarkable appearance, but how in the world have you made her into a humorist?"

"But I always thought the things she said a perfect scream. She was always a humorist."

"You're the only person who ever thought so."

Mrs. Tower, not without magnanimity, acknowledged that she had been mistaken in Gilbert. She grew quite attached to him. But notwithstanding appearances she never faltered in her opinion that the marriage could not last. I was obliged to laugh at her.

"Why, I've never seen such a devoted couple," I said.

"Gilbert is twenty-seven now. It's just the time for a pretty girl to come along. Did you notice the other evening at Jane's that pretty little niece of Sir Reginald's? I thought Jane was looking at them both with a good deal of attention, and I wondered to myself."

"I don't believe Jane fears the rivalry of any girl under the sun."

"Wait and see," said Mrs. Tower.

"You gave it six months."

"Well, now I give it three years."





When anyone is very positive in an opinion it is only human nature to wish him proved wrong. Mrs. Tower was really too cocksure. But such a satisfaction was not mine, for the end that she had always and confidently predicted to the ill-assorted match did in point of fact come. Still, the fates seldom give us what we want in the way we want it, and though Mrs. Tower could flatter herself that she had been right, I think after all she would sooner have been wrong. For things did not happen at all in the way she expected.

One day I received an urgent message from her and fortunately went to see her at once. When I was shown into the room Mrs. Tower rose from her chair and came towards me with the stealthy swiftness of a leopard stalking his prey. I saw that she was excited.

"Jane and Gilbert have separated," she said.

"Not really? Well, you were right after all."

Mrs. Tower looked at me with an expression I could not understand.

"Poor Jane," I muttered.

"Poor Jane!" she repeated, but in tones of such derision that I was dumbfounded.

She found some difficulty in telling me exactly what had occurred.

Gilbert had left her a moment before she leaped to the telephone to summon me. When he entered the room, pale and distraught, she saw at once that something terrible had happened. She knew what he was going to say before he said it.

"Marion, Jane has left me."

She gave him a little smile and took his hand.

"I knew you'd behave like a gentleman. It would have been dreadful for her for people to think that you had left her."

"I've come to you because I knew I could count on your sympathy."

"Oh, I don't blame you, Gilbert," said Mrs. Tower, very kindly. "It was bound to happen." He sighed.

"I suppose so. I couldn't hope to keep her always. She was too wonderful and I'm a perfectly commonplace fellow."

Mrs. Tower patted his hand. He was really behaving beautifully.

"And what's going to happen now?"

"Well, she's going to divorce me."

"Jane always said she'd put no obstacle in your way if ever you wanted to marry a girl."

"You don't think it's likely I should ever be willing to marry anyone else after being Jane's husband," he answered.

Mrs. Tower was puzzled. "Of course you mean that you've left Jane."

"I? That's the last thing I should ever do."

"Then why is she divorcing you?"

"She's going to marry Sir Reginald Frobisher as soon as the decree is made absolute."

Mrs. Tower positively screamed. Then she felt so faint that she had to get her smelling salts.

"After all you've done for her?"

"I've done nothing for her."

"Do you mean to say you're going to allow yourself to be made use of like that?"

"We arranged before we married that if either of us wanted his liberty the other should put no hindrance in the way."

"But that was done on your account. Because you were twenty-seven years younger that she was."

"Well, it's come in very useful for her," he answered bitterly.

Mrs. Tower expostulated, argued, and reasoned; but Gilbert insisted that no rules applied to Jane, and he must do exactly what she wanted. He left Mrs. Tower prostrate. It relieved her a good deal to give me a full account of this interview. It pleased her to see that I was as surprised as herself and if I was not so indignant with Jane as she was she ascribed that to the criminal lack of morality incident to my sex. She was still in a state of extreme agitation when the door was opened and the butler showed in—Jane herself. She was dressed in black and white as no doubt befitted her slightly ambiguous position, but in a dress so original and fantastic, in a hat so striking, that I positively gasped at the sight of her. But she was as ever bland and collected. She came forward to kiss Mrs. Tower, but Mrs. Tower withdrew herself with icy dignity.

"Gilbert has been here," she said.

"Yes, I know," smiled Jane. "I told him to come and see you. I'm going to Paris tonight and I want you to be very kind to him while I'm away. I'm afraid just at first he'll be rather lonely and I shall feel more comfortable if I can count on your keeping an eye on him."

Mrs. Tower clasped her hands.

"Gilbert has just told me something that I can hardly bring myself to believe. He tells me that you're going to divorce him to marry Reginald Frobisher."

"Don't you remember, before I married Gilbert you advised me to marry a man of my own age? The admiral is fifty-three."

"But, Jane, you owe everything to Gilbert," said Mrs. Tower indignantly. "You wouldn't exist without him. Without him to design your clothes, you'll be nothing."

"Oh, he's promised to go on designing my clothes," Jane answered blandly.

"No woman could want a better husband. He's always been kindness itself to you."

"Oh, I know he's been sweet."

"How can you be so heartless?"

"But I was never in love with Gilbert," said Jane. "I always told him that. I'm beginning to feel the need of the companionship of a man of my own age. I think I've probably been married to Gilbert long enough. The young have no conversation." She paused a little and gave us both a charming smile. "Of course I shan't lose sight of Gilbert. I've arranged that with Reginald. The admiral has a niece that would just suit him. As soon as we're married we'll ask them to stay with us at Malta—you know that the admiral is to have the Mediterranean Command—and I shouldn't be at all surprised if they fell in love with one another."

Mrs. Tower gave a little sniff.

"And have you arranged with the admiral that if you want your liberty neither should put any hindrance in the way of the other?"

"I suggested it," Jane answered with composure. "But the admiral says he knows a good thing when he sees it and he won't want to marry anyone else, and if anyone wants to marry me—he has eight twelve-inch guns on his flagship and he'll discuss the matter at short range." She gave us a look through her eyeglass which even the fear of Mrs. Tower's wrath could not prevent me from laughing at. "I think the admiral's a very passionate man."

Mrs. Tower gave me an angry frown.

"I never thought you funny, Jane," she said. "I never understood why people laughed at the things you said."

"I never thought I was funny myself, Marion," smiled Jane, showing her bright, regular teeth. "I am glad to leave London before too many people come round to our opinion."

"I wish you'd tell me the secret of your astonishing success," I said.

She turned to me with that bland, homely look I knew so well.

"You know, when I married Gilbert and settled in London and people began to laugh at what I said no one was more surprised than I was. I'd said the same things for thirty years and no one ever saw anything to laugh at. I thought it must be my clothes or my bobbed hair or my eyeglass. Then I discovered it was because I spoke the truth. It was so unusual that people thought it humorous. One of these days someone else will discover the secret and when people habitually tell the truth of course there'll be nothing funny in it."

"And why am I the only person not to think it funny?" asked Mrs. Tower.

Jane hesitated a little as though she were honestly searching for a satisfactory explanation.

"Perhaps you don't know the truth when you see it, Marion dear," she answered in her mild good-natured way.

It certainly gave her the last word. I felt that Jane would always have the last word. She was priceless.





Rain


IT was nearly bed-time and when they awoke next morning land would be in sight. Dr Macphail lit his pipe and, leaning over the rail, searched the heavens for the Southern Cross. After two years at the front and a wound that had taken longer to heal than it should, he was glad to settle down quietly at Apia for twelve months at least, and he felt already better for the journey. Since some of the passengers were leaving the ship next day at Pago-Pago they had had a little dance that evening and in his ears hammered still the harsh notes of the mechanical piano. But the deck was quiet at last. A little way off he saw his wife in a long chair talking with the Davidsons, and he strolled over to her. When he sat down under the light and took off his hat you saw that he had very red hair, with a bald patch on the crown, and the red, freckled skin which accompanies red hair; he was a man of forty, thin, with a pinched face, precise and rather pedantic; and he spoke with a Scots accent in a very low, quiet voice.

Between the Macphails and the Davidsons, who were missionaries, there had arisen the intimacy of shipboard, which is due to propinquity rather than to any community of taste. Their chief tie was the disapproval they shared of the men who spent their days and nights in the smoking-room playing poker or bridge and drinking. Mrs. Macphail was not a little flattered to think that she and her husband were the only people on board with whom the Davidsons were willing to associate, and even the doctor, shy but no fool, half unconsciously acknowledged the compliment. It was only because he was of an argumentative mind that in their cabin at night he permitted himself to carp.

"Mrs. Davidson was saying she didn't know how they'd have got through the journey if it hadn't been for us," said Mrs. Macphail, as she neatly brushed out her transformation. "She said we were really the only people on the ship they cared to know."

"I shouldn't have thought a missionary was such a big bug that he could afford to put on frills."

"It's not frills. I quite understand what she means. It wouldn't have been very nice for the Davidsons to have to mix with all that rough lot in the smoking-room."

"The founder of their religion wasn't so exclusive," said Dr Macphail with a chuckle.

"I've asked you over and over again not to joke about religion," answered his wife. "I shouldn't like to have a nature like yours, Alec. You never look for the best in people."

He gave her a sidelong glance with his pale, blue eyes, but did not reply. After many years of married life he had learned that it was more conducive to peace to leave his wife with the last word. He was undressed before she was, and climbing into the upper bunk he settled down to read himself to sleep.

When he came on deck next morning they were close to land. He looked at it with greedy eyes. There was a thin strip of silver beach rising quickly to hills covered to the top with luxuriant vegetation. The coconut trees, thick and green, came nearly to the water's edge, and among them you saw the grass houses of the Samoans; and here and there, gleaming white, a little church. Mrs. Davidson came and stood beside him. She was dressed in black and wore round her neck a gold chain, from which dangled a small cross. She was a little woman, with brown, dull hair very elaborately arranged, and she had prominent blue eyes behind invisible pince-nez. Her face was long, like a sheep's, but she gave no impression of foolishness, rather of extreme alertness; she had the quick movements of a bird. The most remarkable thing about her was her voice, high, metallic, and without inflection; it fell on the ear with a hard monotony, irritating to the nerves like the pitiless clamour of the pneumatic drill.

"This must seem like home to you," said Dr Macphail, with his thin, difficult smile.

"Ours are low islands, you know, not like these. Coral. These are volcanic. We've got another ten days' journey to reach them."

"In these parts that's almost like being in the next street at home," said Dr Macphail facetiously.

"Well, that's rather an exaggerated way of putting it, but one does look at distances differently in the South Seas. So far you're right."

Dr Macphail sighed faintly.

"I'm glad we're not stationed here," she went on. "They say this is a terribly difficult place to work in. The steamers' touching makes the people unsettled; and then there's the naval station; that's bad for the natives. In our district we don't have difficulties like that to contend with. There are one or two traders, of course, but we take care to make them behave, and if they don't we make the place so hot for them they're glad to go."

Fixing the glasses on her nose she looked at the green island with a ruthless stare.

"It's almost a hopeless task for the missionaries here. I can never be sufficiently thankful to God that we are at least spared that."

Davidson's district consisted of a group of islands to the North of Samoa; they were widely separated and he had frequently to go long distances by canoe. At these times his wife remained at their headquarters and managed the mission. Dr Macphail felt his heart sink when he considered the efficiency with which she certainly managed it. She spoke of the depravity of the natives in a voice which nothing could hush, but with a vehemently unctuous horror. Her sense of delicacy was singular. Early in their acquaintance she had said to him:

"You know, their marriage customs when we first settled in the islands were so shocking that I couldn't possibly describe them to you. But I'll tell Mrs. Macphail and she'll tell you."

Then he had seen his wife and Mrs. Davidson, their deck-chairs close together, in earnest conversation for about two hours. As he walked past them backwards and forwards for the sake of exercise, he had heard Mrs. Davidson's agitated whisper, like the distant flow of a mountain torrent, and he saw by his wife's open mouth and pale face that she was enjoying an alarming experience. At night in their cabin she repeated to him with bated breath all she had heard.

"Well, what did I say to you?" cried Mrs. Davidson, exultant, next morning. "Did you ever hear anything more dreadful? You don't wonder that I couldn't tell you myself, do you? Even though you are a doctor."

Mrs. Davidson scanned his face. She had a dramatic eagerness to see that she had achieved the desired effect.

"Can you wonder that when we first went there our hearts sank? You'll hardly believe me when I tell you it was impossible to find a single good girl in any of the villages."

She used the word good in a severely technical manner.

"Mr. Davidson and I talked it over, and we made up our minds the first thing to do was to put down the dancing. The natives were crazy about dancing."

"I was not averse to it myself when I was a young man," said Dr Macphail.

"I guessed as much when I heard you ask Mrs. Macphail to have a turn with you last night. I don't think there's any real harm if a man dances with his wife, but I was relieved that she wouldn't. Under the circumstances I thought it better that we should keep ourselves to ourselves."

"Under what circumstances?"

Mrs. Davidson gave him a quick look through her pince-nez, but did not answer his question.

"But among white people it's not quite the same," she went on, "though I must say I agree with Mr. Davidson, who says he can't understand how a husband can stand by and see his wife in another man's arms, and as far as I'm concerned I've never danced a step since I married. But the native dancing is quite another matter. It's not only immoral in itself, but it distinctly leads to immorality. However, I'm thankful to God that we stamped it out, and I don't think I'm wrong in saying that no one has danced in our district for eight years."

But now they came to the mouth of the harbour and Mrs. Macphail joined them. The ship turned sharply and steamed slowly in. It was a great land-locked harbour big enough to hold a fleet of battleships; and all around it rose, high and steep, the green hills. Near the entrance, getting such breeze as blew from the sea, stood the governor's house in a garden. The Stars and Stripes dangled languidly from a flagstaff. They passed two or three trim bungalows, and a tennis court, and then they came to the quay with its warehouses. Mrs. Davidson pointed out the schooner, moored two or three hundred yards from the side, which was to take them to Apia. There was a crowd of eager, noisy, and good-humoured natives come from all parts of the island, some from curiosity, others to barter with the travellers on their way to Sydney; and they brought pineapples and huge bunches of bananas, tapa cloths, necklaces of shells or sharks' teeth, kava-bowls, and models of war canoes. American sailors, neat and trim, clean-shaven and frank of face, sauntered among them, and there was a little group of officials. While their luggage was being landed the Macphails and Mrs. Davidson watched the crowd. Dr Macphail looked at the yaws from which most of the children and the young boys seemed to suffer, disfiguring sores like torpid ulcers, and his professional eyes glistened when he saw for the first time in his experience cases of elephantiasis, men going about with a huge, heavy arm or dragging along a grossly disfigured leg. Men and women wore the lava-lava.

"It's a very indecent costume," said Mrs. Davidson. "Mr. Davidson thinks it should be prohibited by law. How can you expect people to be moral when they wear nothing but a strip of red cotton round their loins?"

"It's suitable enough to the climate," said the doctor, wiping the sweat off his head.

Now that they were on land the heat, though it was so early in the morning, was already oppressive. Closed in by its hills, not a breath of air came in to Pago-Pago.

"In our islands," Mrs. Davidson went on in her high-pitched tones, "we've practically eradicated the lava-lava. A few old men still continue to wear it, but that's all. The women have all taken to the Mother Hubbard, and the men wear trousers and singlets. At the very beginning of our stay Mr. Davidson said in one of his reports: the inhabitants of these islands will never be thoroughly Christianised till every boy of more than ten years is made to wear a pair of trousers."

But Mrs. Davidson had given two or three of her birdlike glances at heavy grey clouds that came floating over the mouth of the harbour. A few drops began to fall.

"We'd better take shelter," she said.

They made their way with all the crowd to a great shed of corrugated iron, and the rain began to fall in torrents. They stood there for some time and then were joined by Mr. Davidson. He had been polite enough to the Macphails during the journey, but he had not his wife's sociability, and had spent much of his time reading. He was a silent, rather sullen man, and you felt that his affability was a duty that he imposed upon himself Christianly; he was by nature reserved and even morose. His appearance was singular. He was very tall and thin, with long limbs loosely jointed; hollow cheeks and curiously high cheek-bones; he had so cadaverous an air that it surprised you to notice how full and sensual were his lips. He wore his hair very long. His dark eyes, set deep in their sockets, were large and tragic; and his hands with their big, long fingers, were finely shaped; they gave him a look of great strength. But the most striking thing about him was the feeling he gave you of suppressed fire. It was impressive and vaguely troubling. He was not a man with whom any intimacy was possible.

He brought now unwelcome news. There was an epidemic of measles, a serious and often fatal disease among the Kanakas, on the island, and a case had developed among the crew of the schooner which was to take them on their journey. The sick man had been brought ashore and put in hospital on the quarantine station, but telegraphic instructions had been sent from Apia to say that the schooner would not be allowed to enter the harbour till it was certain no other member of the crew was affected.

"It means we shall have to stay here for ten days at least."

"But I'm urgently needed at Apia," said Dr Macphail.

"That can't be helped. If no more cases develop on board, the schooner will be allowed to sail with white passengers, but all native traffic is prohibited for three months."

"Is there a hotel here?" asked Mrs. Macphail.

Davidson gave a low chuckle.

"There's not."

"What shall we do then?"

"I've been talking to the governor. There's a trader along the front who has rooms that he rents, and my proposition is that as soon as the rain lets up we should go along there and see what we can do. Don't expect comfort. You've just got to be thankful if we get a bed to sleep on and a roof over our heads."

But the rain showed no sign of stopping, and at length with umbrellas and waterproofs they set out. There was no town, but merely a group of official buildings, a store or two, and at the back, among the coconut trees and plantains, a few native dwellings. The house they sought was about five minutes' walk from the wharf. It was a frame house of two storeys, with broad verandahs on both floors and a roof of corrugated iron. The owner was a half-caste named Horn, with a native wife surrounded by little brown children, and on the ground-floor he had a store where he sold canned goods and cottons. The rooms he showed them were almost bare of furniture. In the Macphails' there was nothing but a poor, worn bed with a ragged mosquito net, a rickety chair, and a washstand. They looked round with dismay. The rain poured down without ceasing.

"I'm not going to unpack more than we actually need," said Mrs. Macphail.

Mrs. Davidson came into the room as she was unlocking a portmanteau. She was very brisk and alert. The cheerless surroundings had no effect on her.

"If you'll take my advice you'll get a needle and cotton and start right in to mend the mosquito net," she said, "or you'll not be able to get a wink of sleep to-night."

"Will they be very bad?" asked Dr Macphail.

"This is the season for them. When you're asked to a party at Government House at Apia you'll notice that all the ladies are given a pillow-slip to put their—their lower extremities in."

"I wish the rain would stop for a moment," said Mrs. Macphail. "I could try to make the place comfortable with more heart if the sun were shining."

"Oh, if you wait for that, you'll wait a long time. Pago-Pago is about the rainiest place in the Pacific. You see, the hills, and that bay, they attract the water, and one expects rain at this time of year anyway."

She looked from Macphail to his wife, standing helplessly in different parts of the room, like lost souls, and she pursed her lips. She saw that she must take them in hand. Feckless people like that made her impatient, but her hands itched to put everything in the order which came so naturally to her.

"Here, you give me a needle and cotton and I'll mend that net of yours, while you go on with your unpacking. Dinner's at one. Dr Macphail, you'd better go down to the wharf and see that your heavy luggage has been put in a dry place. You know what these natives are, they're quite capable of storing it where the rain will beat in on it all the time."

The doctor put on his waterproof again and went downstairs. At the door Mr. Horn was standing in conversation with the quartermaster of the ship they had just arrived in and a second-class passenger whom Dr Macphail had seen several times on board. The quartermaster, a little, shrivelled man, extremely dirty, nodded to him as he passed.

"This is a bad job about the measles, doc," he said. "I see you've fixed yourself up already."

Dr Macphail thought he was rather familiar, but he was a timid man and he did not take offence easily.

"Yes, we've got a room upstairs."

"Miss Thompson was sailing with you to Apia, so I've brought her along here."

The quartermaster pointed with his thumb to the woman standing by his side. She was twenty-seven perhaps, plump, and in a coarse fashion pretty. She wore a white dress and a large white hat. Her fat calves in white cotton stockings bulged over the tops of long white boots in glacé kid. She gave Macphail an ingratiating smile.

"The feller's tryin' to soak me a dollar and a half a day for the meanest sized room," she said in a hoarse voice.

"I tell you she's a friend of mine, Jo," said the quartermaster. "She can't pay more than a dollar, and you've sure got to take her for that."

The trader was fat and smooth and quietly smiling.

"Well, if you put it like that, Mr. Swan, I'll see what I can do about it. I'll talk to Mrs. Horn and if we think we can make a reduction we will."

"Don't try to pull that stuff with me," said Miss Thompson. "We'll settle this right now. You get a dollar a day for the room and not one bean more."

Dr Macphail smiled. He admired the effrontery with which she bargained. He was the sort of man who always paid what he was asked. He preferred to be over-charged than to haggle. The trader sighed.

"Well, to oblige Mr. Swan I'll take it."

"That's the goods," said Miss Thompson. "Come right in and have a shot of hooch. I've got some real good rye in that grip if you'll bring it along, Mr. Swan. You come along too, doctor."

"Oh, I don't think I will, thank you," he answered. "I'm just going down to see that our luggage is all right."

He stepped out into the rain. It swept in from the opening of the harbour in sheets and the opposite shore was all blurred. He passed two or three natives clad in nothing but the lava-lava, with huge umbrellas over them. They walked finely, with leisurely movements, very upright; and they smiled and greeted him in a strange tongue as they went by.

It was nearly dinner-time when he got back, and their meal was laid in the trader's parlour. It was a room designed not to live in but for purposes of prestige, and it had a musty, melancholy air. A suite of stamped plush was arranged neatly round the walls, and from the middle of the ceiling, protected from the flies by yellow tissue paper, hung a gilt chandelier. Davidson did not come.

"I know he went to call on the governor," said Mrs. Davidson, "and I guess he's kept him to dinner."

A little native girl brought them a dish of Hamburger steak, and after a while the trader came up to see that they had everything they wanted.

"I see we have a fellow lodger, Mr. Horn," said Dr Macphail.

"She's taken a room, that's all," answered the trader. "She's getting her own board."

He looked at the two ladies with an obsequious air.

"I put her downstairs so she shouldn't be in the way. She won't be any trouble to you."

"Is it someone who was on the boat?" asked Mrs. Macphail.

"Yes, ma'am, she was in the second cabin. She was going to Apia. She has a position as cashier waiting for her."

"Oh!"

When the trader was gone Macphail said:

"I shouldn't think she'd find it exactly cheerful having her meals in her room."

"If she was in the second cabin I guess she'd rather," answered Mrs. Davidson. "I don't exactly know who it can be."

"I happened to be there when the quartermaster brought her along. Her name's Thompson."

"It's not the woman who was dancing with the quartermaster last night?" asked Mrs. Davidson.

"That's who it must be," said Mrs. Macphail. "I wondered at the time what she was. She looked rather fast to me."

"Not good style at all," said Mrs. Davidson.

They began to talk of other things, and after dinner, tired with their early rise, they separated and slept. When they awoke, though the sky was still grey and the clouds hung low, it was not raining and they went for a walk on the high road which the Americans had built along the bay.

On their return they found that Davidson had just come in.

"We may be here for a fortnight," he said irritably. "I've argued it out with the governor, but he says there is nothing to be done."

"Mr. Davidson's just longing to get back to his work," said his wife, with an anxious glance at him.

"We've been away for a year," he said, walking up and down the verandah. "The mission has been in charge of native missionaries and I'm terribly nervous that they've let things slide. They're good men, I'm not saying a word against them, God-fearing, devout, and truly Christian men—their Christianity would put many so-called Christians at home to the blush—but they're pitifully lacking in energy. They can make a stand once, they can make a stand twice, but they can't make a stand all the time. If you leave a mission in charge of a native missionary, no matter how trustworthy he seems, in course of time you'll find he's let abuses creep in."

Mr. Davidson stood still. With his tall, spare form, and his great eyes flashing out of his pale face, he was an impressive figure. His sincerity was obvious in the fire of his gestures and in his deep, ringing voice.

"I expect to have my work cut out for me. I shall act and I shall act promptly. If the tree is rotten it shall be cut down and cast into the flames."

And in the evening after the high tea which was their last meal, while they sat in the stiff parlour, the ladies working and Dr Macphail smoking his pipe, the missionary told them of his work in the islands.

"When we went there they had no sense of sin at all," he said. "They broke the commandments one after the other and never knew they were doing wrong. And I think that was the most difficult part of my work, to instil into the natives the sense of sin."

The Macphails knew already that Davidson had worked in the Solomons for five years before he met his wife. She had been a missionary in China, and they had become acquainted in Boston, where they were both spending part of their leave to attend a missionary congress. On their marriage they had been appointed to the islands in which they had laboured ever since.

In the course of all the conversations they had had with Mr. Davidson one thing had shone out clearly and that was the man's unflinching courage. He was a medical missionary, and he was liable to be called at any time to one or other of the islands in the group. Even the whaleboat is not so very safe a conveyance in the stormy Pacific of the wet season, but often he would be sent for in a canoe, and then the danger was great. In cases of illness or accident he never hesitated. A dozen times he had spent the whole night baling for his life, and more than once Mrs. Davidson had given him up for lost.

"I'd beg him not to go sometimes," she said, "or at least to wait till the weather was more settled, but he'd never listen. He's obstinate, and when he's once made up his mind, nothing can move him."

"How can I ask the natives to put their trust in the Lord if I am afraid to do so myself?" cried Davidson. "And I'm not, I'm not. They know that if they send for me in their trouble I'll come if it's humanly possible. And do you think the Lord is going to abandon me when I am on his business? The wind blows at his bidding and the waves toss and rage at his word."

Dr Macphail was a timid man. He had never been able to get used to the hurtling of the shells over the trenches, and when he was operating in an advanced dressing-station the sweat poured from his brow and dimmed his spectacles in the effort he made to control his unsteady hand. He shuddered a little as he looked at the missionary.

"I wish I could say that I've never been afraid," he said.

"I wish you could say that you believed in God," retorted the other.

But for some reason, that evening the missionary's thoughts travelled back to the early days he and his wife had spent on the islands.

"Sometimes Mrs. Davidson and I would look at one another and the tears would stream down our cheeks. We worked without ceasing, day and night, and we seemed to make no progress. I don't know what I should have done without her then. When I felt my heart sink, when I was very near despair, she gave me courage and hope."

Mrs. Davidson looked down at her work, and a slight colour rose to her thin cheeks. Her hands trembled a little. She did not trust herself to speak.

"We had no one to help us. We were alone, thousands of miles from any of our own people, surrounded by darkness. When I was broken and weary she would put her work aside and take the Bible and read to me till peace came and settled upon me like sleep upon the eyelids of a child, and when at last she closed the book she'd say: 'We'll save them in spite of themselves.' And I felt strong again in the Lord, and I answered: 'Yes, with God's help I'll save them. I must save them.'"

He came over to the table and stood in front of it as though it were a lectern.

"You see, they were so naturally depraved that they couldn't be brought to see their wickedness. We had to make sins out of what they thought were natural actions. We had to make it a sin, not only to commit adultery and to lie and thieve, but to expose their bodies, and to dance and not to come to church. I made it a sin for a girl to show her bosom and a sin for a man not to wear trousers."

"How?" asked Dr Macphail, not without surprise.

"I instituted fines. Obviously the only way to make people realise that an action is sinful is to punish them if they commit it. I fined them if they didn't come to church, and I fined them if they danced. I fined them if they were improperly dressed. I had a tariff, and every sin had to be paid for either in money or work. And at last I made them understand."

"But did they never refuse to pay?"

"How could they?" asked the missionary.

"It would be a brave man who tried to stand up against Mr. Davidson," said his wife, tightening her lips.

Dr Macphail looked at Davidson with troubled eyes. What he heard shocked him, but he hesitated to express his disapproval.

"You must remember that in the last resort I could expel them from their church membership."

"Did they mind that?"

Davidson smiled a little and gently rubbed his hands.

"They couldn't sell their copra. When the men fished they got no share of the catch. It meant something very like starvation. Yes, they minded quite a lot."

"Tell him about Fred Ohlson," said Mrs. Davidson.

The missionary fixed his fiery eyes on Dr Macphail.

"Fred Ohlson was a Danish trader who had been in the islands a good many years. He was a pretty rich man as traders go and he wasn't very pleased when we came. You see, he'd had things very much his own way. He paid the natives what he liked for their copra, and he paid in goods and whiskey. He had a native wife, but he was flagrantly unfaithful to her. He was a drunkard. I gave him a chance to mend his ways, but he wouldn't take it. He laughed at me."

Davidson's voice fell to a deep bass as he said the last words, and he was silent for a minute or two. The silence was heavy with menace.

"In two years he was a ruined man. He'd lost everything he'd saved in a quarter of a century. I broke him, and at last he was forced to come to me like a beggar and beseech me to give him a passage back to Sydney."

"I wish you could have seen him when he came to see Mr. Davidson," said the missionary's wife. "He had been a fine, powerful man, with a lot of fat on him, and he had a great big voice, but now he was half the size, and he was shaking all over. He'd suddenly become an old man."

With abstracted gaze Davidson looked out into the night. The rain was falling again.

Suddenly from below came a sound, and Davidson turned and looked questioningly at his wife. It was the sound of a gramophone, harsh and loud, wheezing out a syncopated tune.

"What's that?" he asked.

Mrs. Davidson fixed her pince-nez more firmly on her nose.

"One of the second-class passengers has a room in the house. I guess it comes from there."

They listened in silence, and presently they heard the sound of dancing. Then the music stopped, and they heard the popping of corks and voices raised in animated conversation.

"I daresay she's giving a farewell party to her friends on board," said Dr Macphail. "The ship sails at twelve, doesn't it?"

Davidson made no remark, but he looked at his watch.

"Are you ready?" he asked his wife.

She got up and folded her work.

"Yes, I guess I am," she answered.

"It's early to go to bed yet, isn't it?" said the doctor.

"We have a good deal of reading to do," explained Mrs. Davidson. "Wherever we are, we read a chapter of the Bible before retiring for the night and we study it with the commentaries, you know, and discuss it thoroughly. It's a wonderful training for the mind."

The two couples bade one another good night. Dr and Mrs. Macphail were left alone. For two or three minutes they did not speak.

"I think I'll go and fetch the cards," the doctor said at last.

Mrs. Macphail looked at him doubtfully. Her conversation with the Davidsons had left her a little uneasy, but she did not like to say that she thought they had better not play cards when the Davidsons might come in at any moment. Dr Macphail brought them and she watched him, though with a vague sense of guilt, while he laid out his patience. Below the sound of revelry continued.

It was fine enough next day, and the Macphails, condemned to spend a fortnight of idleness at Pago-Pago, set about making the best of things. They went down to the quay and got out of their boxes a number of books. The doctor called on the chief surgeon of the naval hospital and went round the beds with him. They left cards on the governor. They passed Miss Thompson on the road. The doctor took off his hat, and she gave him a "Good morning, doc." in a loud, cheerful voice. She was dressed as on the day before, in a white frock, and her shiny white boots with their high heels, her fat legs bulging over the tops of them, were strange things on that exotic scene.

"I don't think she's very suitably dressed, I must say," said Mrs. Macphail. "She looks extremely common to me."

When they got back to their house, she was on the verandah playing with one of the trader's dark children.

"Say a word to her," Dr Macphail whispered to his wife. "She's all alone here, and it seems rather unkind to ignore her."

Mrs. Macphail was shy, but she was in the habit of doing what her husband bade her.

"I think we're fellow lodgers here," she said, rather foolishly.

"Terrible, ain't it, bein' cooped up in a one-horse burg like this?" answered Miss Thompson. "And they tell me I'm lucky to have gotten a room. I don't see myself livin' in a native house, and that's what some have to do. I don't know why they don't have a hotel."

They exchanged a few more words. Miss Thompson, loud-voiced and garrulous, was evidently quite willing to gossip, but Mrs. Macphail had a poor stock of small talk and presently she said:

"Well, I think we must go upstairs."

In the evening when they sat down to their high-tea Davidson on coming in said:

"I see that woman downstairs has a couple of sailors sitting there. I wonder how she's gotten acquainted with them."

"She can't be very particular," said Mrs. Davidson.

They were all rather tired after the idle, aimless day.

"If there's going to be a fortnight of this I don't know what we shall feel like at the end of it," said Dr Macphail.

"The only thing to do is to portion out the day to different activities," answered the missionary. "I shall set aside a certain number of hours to study and a certain number to exercise, rain or fine—in the wet season you can't afford to pay any attention to the rain—and a certain number to recreation."

Dr Macphail looked at his companion with misgiving. Davidson's programme oppressed him. They were eating Hamburger steak again. It seemed the only dish the cook knew how to make. Then below the gramophone began. Davidson started nervously when he heard it, but said nothing. Men's voices floated up. Miss Thompson's guests were joining in a well-known song and presently they heard her voice too, hoarse and loud. There was a good deal of shouting and laughing. The four people upstairs, trying to make conversation, listened despite themselves to the clink of glasses and the scrape of chairs. More people had evidently come. Miss Thompson was giving a party.

"I wonder how she gets them all in," said Mrs. Macphail, suddenly breaking into a medical conversation between the missionary and her husband.

It showed whither her thoughts were wandering. The twitch of Davidson's face proved that, though he spoke of scientific things, his mind was busy in the same direction. Suddenly, while the doctor was giving some experience of practice on the Flanders front, rather prosily, he sprang to his feet with a cry.

"What's the matter, Alfred?" asked Mrs. Davidson.

"Of course! It never occurred to me. She's out of Iwelei."

"She can't be."

"She came on board at Honolulu. It's obvious. And she's carrying on her trade here. Here."

He uttered the last word with a passion of indignation.

"What's Iwelei?" asked Mrs. Macphail.

He turned his gloomy eyes on her and his voice trembled with horror.

"The plague spot of Honolulu. The Red Light district. It was a blot on our civilisation."

Iwelei was on the edge of the city. You went down side streets by the harbour, in the darkness, across a rickety bridge, till you came to a deserted road, all ruts and holes, and then suddenly you came out into the light. There was parking room for motors on each side of the road, and there were saloons, tawdry and bright, each one noisy with its mechanical piano, and there were barbers' shops and tobacconists. There was a stir in the air and a sense of expectant gaiety. You turned down a narrow alley, either to the right or to the left, for the road divided Iwelei into two parts, and you found yourself in the district. There were rows of little bungalows, trim and neatly painted in green, and the pathway between them was broad and straight. It was laid out like a garden-city. In its respectable regularity, its order and spruceness, it gave an impression of sardonic horror; for never can the search for love have been so systematised and ordered. The pathways were lit by a rare lamp, but they would have been dark except for the lights that came from the open windows of the bungalows. Men wandered about, looking at the women who sat at their windows, reading or sewing, for the most part taking no notice of the passers-by; and like the women they were of all nationalities. There were Americans, sailors from the ships in port, enlisted men off the gunboats, sombrely drunk, and soldiers from the regiments, white and black, quartered on the island; there were Japanese, walking in twos and threes; Hawaiians, Chinese in long robes, and Filipinos in preposterous hats. They were silent and as it were oppressed. Desire is sad.

"It was the most crying scandal of the Pacific," exclaimed Davidson vehemently. "The missionaries had been agitating against it for years, and at last the local press took it up. The police refused to stir. You know their argument. They say that vice is inevitable and consequently the best thing is to localise and control it. The truth is, they were paid. Paid. They were paid by the saloon-keepers, paid by the bullies, paid by the women themselves. At last they were forced to move."

"I read about it in the papers that came on board in Honolulu," said Dr Macphail.

"Iwelei, with its sin and shame, ceased to exist on the very day we arrived. The whole population was brought before the justices. I don't know why I didn't understand at once what that woman was."

"Now you come to speak of it," said Mrs. Macphail, "I remember seeing her come on board only a few minutes before the boat sailed. I remember thinking at the time she was cutting it rather fine."

"How dare she come here!" cried Davidson indignantly. "I'm not going to allow it."

He strode towards the door.

"What are you going to do?" asked Macphail.

"What do you expect me to do? I'm going to stop it. I'm not going to have this house turned into—into. . . ."

He sought for a word that should not offend the ladies' ears. His eyes were flashing and his pale face was paler still in his emotion.

"It sounds as though there were three or four men down there," said the doctor. "Don't you think it's rather rash to go in just now?"

The missionary gave him a contemptuous look and without a word flung out of the room.

"You know Mr. Davidson very little if you think the fear of personal danger can stop him in the performance of his duty," said his wife.

She sat with her hands nervously clasped, a spot of colour on her high cheek bones, listening to what was about to happen below. They all listened. They heard him clatter down the wooden stairs and throw open the door. The singing stopped suddenly, but the gramophone continued to bray out its vulgar tune. They heard Davidson's voice and then the noise of something heavy falling. The music stopped. He had hurled the gramophone on the floor. Then again they heard Davidson's voice, they could not make out the words, then Miss Thompson's, loud and shrill, then a confused clamour as though several people were shouting together at the top of their lungs. Mrs. Davidson gave a little gasp, and she clenched her hands more tightly. Dr Macphail looked uncertainly from her to his wife. He did not want to go down, but he wondered if they expected him to. Then there was something that sounded like a scuffle. The noise now was more distinct. It might be that Davidson was being thrown out of the room. The door was slammed. There was a moment's silence and they heard Davidson come up the stairs again. He went to his room.

"I think I'll go to him," said Mrs. Davidson.

She got up and went out.

"If you want me, just call," said Mrs. Macphail, and then when the other was gone: "I hope he isn't hurt."

"Why couldn't he mind his own business?" said Dr Macphail.

They sat in silence for a minute or two and then they both started, for the gramophone began to play once more, defiantly, and mocking voices shouted hoarsely the words of an obscene song.

Next day Mrs. Davidson was pale and tired. She complained of headache, and she looked old and wizened. She told Mrs. Macphail that the missionary had not slept at all; he had passed the night in a state of frightful agitation and at five had got up and gone out. A glass of beer had been thrown over him and his clothes were stained and stinking. But a sombre fire glowed in Mrs. Davidson's eyes when she spoke of Miss Thompson.

"She'll bitterly rue the day when she flouted Mr. Davidson," she said. "Mr. Davidson has a wonderful heart and no one who is in trouble has ever gone to him without being comforted, but he has no mercy for sin, and when his righteous wrath is excited he's terrible."

"Why, what will he do?" asked Mrs. Macphail.

"I don't know, but I wouldn't stand in that creature's shoes for anything in the world."

Mrs. Macphail shuddered. There was something positively alarming in the triumphant assurance of the little woman's manner. They were going out together that morning, and they went down the stairs side by side. Miss Thompson's door was open, and they saw her in a bedraggled dressing-gown, cooking something in a chafing-dish.

"Good morning," she called. "Is Mr. Davidson better this morning?"

They passed her in silence, with their noses in the air, as if she did not exist. They flushed, however, when she burst into a shout of derisive laughter. Mrs. Davidson turned on her suddenly.

"Don't you dare to speak to me," she screamed. "If you insult me I shall have you turned out of here."

"Say, did I ask Mr. Davidson to visit with me?"

"Don't answer her," whispered Mrs. Macphail hurriedly.

They walked on till they were out of earshot.

"She's brazen, brazen," burst from Mrs. Davidson.

Her anger almost suffocated her.

And on their way home they met her strolling towards the quay. She had all her finery on. Her great white hat with its vulgar, showy flowers was an affront. She called out cheerily to them as she went by, and a couple of American sailors who were standing there grinned as the ladies set their faces to an icy stare. They got in just before the rain began to fall again.

"I guess she'll get her fine clothes spoilt," said Mrs. Davidson with a bitter sneer.

Davidson did not come in till they were half way through dinner. He was wet through, but he would not change. He sat, morose and silent, refusing to eat more than a mouthful, and he stared at the slanting rain. When Mrs. Davidson told him of their two encounters with Miss Thompson he did not answer. His deepening frown alone showed that he had heard.

"Don't you think we ought to make Mr. Horn turn her out of here?" asked Mrs. Davidson. "We can't allow her to insult us."

"There doesn't seem to be any other place for her to go," said Macphail.

"She can live with one of the natives."

"In weather like this a native hut must be a rather uncomfortable place to live in."

"I lived in one for years," said the missionary.

When the little native girl brought in the fried bananas which formed the sweet they had every day, Davidson turned to her.

"Ask Miss Thompson when it would be convenient for me to see her," he said.

The girl nodded shyly and went out.

"What do you want to see her for, Alfred?" asked his wife.

"It's my duty to see her. I won't act till I've given her every chance."

"You don't know what she is. She'll insult you."

"Let her insult me. Let her spit on me. She has an immortal soul, and I must do all that is in my power to save it."

Mrs. Davidson's ears rang still with the harlot's mocking laughter.

"She's gone too far."

"Too far for the mercy of God?" His eyes lit up suddenly and his voice grew mellow and soft. "Never. The sinner may be deeper in sin than the depth of hell itself, but the love of the Lord Jesus can reach him still."

The girl came back with the message.

"Miss Thompson's compliments and as long as Rev. Davidson don't come in business hours she'll be glad to see him any time."

The party received it in stony silence, and Dr Macphail quickly effaced from his lips the smile which had come upon them. He knew his wife would be vexed with him if he found Miss Thompson's effrontery amusing.

They finished the meal in silence. When it was over the two ladies got up and took their work, Mrs. Macphail was making another of the innumerable comforters which she had turned out since the beginning of the war, and the doctor lit his pipe. But Davidson remained in his chair and with abstracted eyes stared at the table. At last he got up and without a word went out of the room. They heard him go down and they heard Miss Thompson's defiant "Come in" when he knocked at the door. He remained with her for an hour. And Dr Macphail watched the rain. It was beginning to get on his nerves. It was not like our soft English rain that drops gently on the earth; it was unmerciful and somehow terrible; you felt in it the malignancy of the primitive powers of nature. It did not pour, it flowed. It was like a deluge from heaven, and it rattled on the roof of corrugated iron with a steady persistence that was maddening. It seemed to have a fury of its own. And sometimes you felt that you must scream if it did not stop, and then suddenly you felt powerless, as though your bones had suddenly become soft; and you were miserable and hopeless.

Macphail turned his head when the missionary came back. The two women looked up.

"I've given her every chance. I have exhorted her to repent. She is an evil woman."

He paused, and Dr Macphail saw his eyes darken and his pale face grow hard and stern.

"Now I shall take the whips with which the Lord Jesus drove the usurers and the money changers out of the Temple of the Most High."

He walked up and down the room. His mouth was close set, and his black brows were frowning.

"If she fled to the uttermost parts of the earth I should pursue her."

With a sudden movement he turned round and strode out of the room. They heard him go downstairs again.

"What is he going to do?" asked Mrs. Macphail.

"I don't know." Mrs. Davidson took off her pince-nez and wiped them. "When he is on the Lord's work I never ask him questions."

She sighed a little.

"What is the matter?"

"He'll wear himself out. He doesn't know what it is to spare himself."

Dr Macphail learnt the first results of the missionary's activity from the half-caste trader in whose house they lodged. He stopped the doctor when he passed the store and came out to speak to him on the stoop. His fat face was worried.

"The Rev. Davidson has been at me for letting Miss Thompson have a room here," he said, "but I didn't know what she was when I rented it to her. When people come and ask if I can rent them a room all I want to know is if they've the money to pay for it. And she paid me for hers a week in advance."

Dr Macphail did not want to commit himself.

"When all's said and done it's your house. We're very much obliged to you for taking us in at all."

Horn looked at him doubtfully. He was not certain yet how definitely Macphail stood on the missionary's side.

"The missionaries are in with one another," he said, hesitatingly. "If they get it in for a trader he may just as well shut up his store and quit."

"Did he want you to turn her out?"

"No, he said so long as she behaved herself he couldn't ask me to do that. He said he wanted to be just to me. I promised she shouldn't have no more visitors. I've just been and told her."

"How did she take it?"

"She gave me Hell."

The trader squirmed in his old ducks. He had found Miss Thompson a rough customer.

"Oh, well, I daresay she'll get out. I don't suppose she wants to stay here if she can't have anyone in."

"There's nowhere she can go, only a native house, and no native'll take her now, not now that the missionaries have got their knife in her."

Dr Macphail looked at the falling rain.

"Well, I don't suppose it's any good waiting for it to clear up."

In the evening when they sat in the parlour Davidson talked to them of his early days at college. He had had no means and had worked his way through by doing odd jobs during the vacations. There was silence downstairs. Miss Thompson was sitting in her little room alone. But suddenly the gramophone began to play. She had set it on in defiance, to cheat her loneliness, but there was no one to sing, and it had a melancholy note. It was like a cry for help. Davidson took no notice. He was in the middle of a long anecdote and without change of expression went on. The gramophone continued. Miss Thompson put on one reel after another. It looked as though the silence of the night were getting on her nerves. It was breathless and sultry. When the Macphails went to bed they could not sleep. They lay side by side with their eyes wide open, listening to the cruel singing of the mosquitoes outside their curtain.

"What's that?" whispered Mrs. Macphail at last.

They heard a voice, Davidson's voice, through the wooden partition. It went on with a monotonous, earnest insistence. He was praying aloud. He was praying for the soul of Miss Thompson.

Two or three days went by. Now when they passed Miss Thompson on the road she did not greet them with ironic cordiality or smile; she passed with her nose in the air, a sulky look on her painted face, frowning, as though she did not see them. The trader told Macphail that she had tried to get lodging elsewhere, but had failed. In the evening she played through the various reels of her gramophone, but the pretence of mirth was obvious now. The ragtime had a cracked, heart-broken rhythm as though it were a one-step of despair. When she began to play on Sunday Davidson sent Horn to beg her to stop at once since it was the Lord's day. The reel was taken off and the house was silent except for the steady pattering of the rain on the iron roof.

"I think she's getting a bit worked up," said the trader next day to Macphail. "She don't know what Mr. Davidson's up to and it makes her scared."

Macphail had caught a glimpse of her that morning and it struck him that her arrogant expression had changed. There was in her face a hunted look. The half-caste gave him a sidelong glance.

"I suppose you don't know what Mr. Davidson is doing about it?" he hazarded.

"No, I don't."

It was singular that Horn should ask him that question, for he also had the idea that the missionary was mysteriously at work. He had an impression that he was weaving a net around the woman, carefully, systematically, and suddenly, when everything was ready would pull the strings tight.

"He told me to tell her," said the trader, "that if at any time she wanted him she only had to send and he'd come."

"What did she say when you told her that?"

"She didn't say nothing. I didn't stop. I just said what he said I was to and then I beat it. I thought she might be going to start weepin'."

"I have no doubt the loneliness is getting on her nerves," said the doctor. "And the rain—that's enough to make anyone jumpy," he continued irritably. "Doesn't it ever stop in this confounded place?"

"It goes on pretty steady in the rainy season. We have three hundred inches in the year. You see, it's the shape of the bay. It seems to attract the rain from all over the Pacific."

"Damn the shape of the bay," said the doctor.

He scratched his mosquito bites. He felt very short-tempered. When the rain stopped and the sun shone, it was like a hothouse, seething, humid, sultry, breathless, and you had a strange feeling that everything was growing with a savage violence. The natives, blithe and childlike by reputation, seemed then, with their tattooing and their dyed hair, to have something sinister in their appearance; and when they pattered along at your heels with their naked feet you looked back instinctively. You felt they might at any moment come behind you swiftly and thrust a long knife between your shoulder blades. You could not tell what dark thoughts lurked behind their wide-set eyes. They had a little the look of ancient Egyptians painted on a temple wall, and there was about them the terror of what is immeasurably old.

The missionary came and went. He was busy, but the Macphails did not know what he was doing. Horn told the doctor that he saw the governor every day, and once Davidson mentioned him.

"He looks as if he had plenty of determination," he said, "but when you come down to brass tacks he has no backbone."

"I suppose that means he won't do exactly what you want," suggested the doctor facetiously.

The missionary did not smile.

"I want him to do what's right. It shouldn't be necessary to persuade a man to do that."

"But there may be differences of opinion about what is right."

"If a man had a gangrenous foot would you have patience with anyone who hesitated to amputate it?"

"Gangrene is a matter of fact."

"And Evil?"

What Davidson had done soon appeared. The four of them had just finished their midday meal, and they had not yet separated for the siesta which the heat imposed on the ladies and on the doctor. Davidson had little patience with the slothful habit. The door was suddenly flung open and Miss Thompson came in. She looked round the room and then went up to Davidson.

"You low-down skunk, what have you been saying about me to the governor?"

She was spluttering with rage. There was a moment's pause. Then the missionary drew forward a chair.

"Won't you be seated, Miss Thompson? I've been hoping to have another talk with you."

"You poor low-life bastard."

She burst into a torrent of insult, foul and insolent. Davidson kept his grave eyes on her.

"I'm indifferent to the abuse you think fit to heap on me, Miss Thompson," he said, "but I must beg you to remember that ladies are present."

Tears by now were struggling with her anger. Her face was red and swollen as though she were choking.

"What has happened?" asked Dr Macphail.

"A feller's just been in here and he says I gotter beat it on the next boat."

Was there a gleam in the missionary's eyes? His face remained impassive.

"You could hardly expect the governor to let you stay here under the circumstances."

"You done it," she shrieked. "You can't kid me. You done it."

"I don't want to deceive you. I urged the governor to take the only possible step consistent with his obligations."

"Why couldn't you leave me be? I wasn't doin' you no harm."

"You may be sure that if you had I should be the last man to resent it."

"Do you think I want to stay on in this poor imitation of a burg? I don't look no busher, do I?"

"In that case I don't see what cause of complaint you have," he answered.

She gave an inarticulate cry of rage and flung out of the room. There was a short silence.

"It's a relief to know that the governor has acted at last," said Davidson finally. "He's a weak man and he shilly-shallied. He said she was only here for a fortnight anyway, and if she went on to Apia that was under British jurisdiction and had nothing to do with him."

The missionary sprang to his feet and strode across the room.

"It's terrible the way the men who are in authority seek to evade their responsibility. They speak as though evil that was out of sight ceased to be evil. The very existence of that woman is a scandal and it does not help matters to shift it to another of the islands. In the end I had to speak straight from the shoulder."

Davidson's brow lowered, and he protruded his firm chin. He looked fierce and determined.

"What do you mean by that?"

"Our mission is not entirely without influence at Washington. I pointed out to the governor that it wouldn't do him any good if there was a complaint about the way he managed things here."

"When has she got to go?" asked the doctor, after a pause.

"The San Francisco boat is due here from Sydney next Tuesday. She's to sail on that."

That was in five days' time. It was next day, when he was coming back from the hospital where for want of something better to do Macphail spent most of his mornings, that the half-caste stopped him as he was going upstairs.

"Excuse me, Dr Macphail, Miss Thompson's sick. Will you have a look at her."

"Certainly."

Horn led him to her room. She was sitting in a chair idly, neither reading nor sewing, staring in front of her. She wore her white dress and the large hat with the flowers on it. Macphail noticed that her skin was yellow and muddy under her powder, and her eyes were heavy.

"I'm sorry to hear you're not well," he said.

"Oh, I ain't sick really. I just said that, because I just had to see you. I've got to clear on a boat that's going to 'Frisco'."

She looked at him and he saw that her eyes were suddenly startled. She opened and clenched her hands spasmodically. The trader stood at the door, listening.

"So I understand," said the doctor.

She gave a little gulp.

"I guess it ain't very convenient for me to go to 'Frisco' just now. I went to see the governor yesterday afternoon, but I couldn't get to him. I saw the secretary, and he told me I'd got to take that boat and that was all there was to it. I just had to see the governor, so I waited outside his house this morning, and when he come out I spoke to him. He didn't want to speak to me, I'll say, but I wouldn't let him shake me off, and at last he said he hadn't no objection to my staying here till the next boat to Sydney if the Rev. Davidson will stand for it."

She stopped and looked at Dr Macphail anxiously.

"I don't know exactly what I can do," he said.

"Well, I thought maybe you wouldn't mind asking him. I swear to God I won't start anything here if he'll just only let me stay. I won't go out of the house if that'll suit him. It's no more'n a fortnight."

"I'll ask him."

"He won't stand for it," said Horn. "He'll have you out on Tuesday, so you may as well make up your mind to it."

"Tell him I can get work in Sydney, straight stuff, I mean. 'Tain't asking very much."

"I'll do what I can."

"And come and tell me right away, will you? I can't set down to a thing till I get the dope one way or the other."

It was not an errand that much pleased the doctor, and, characteristically perhaps, he went about it indirectly. He told his wife what Miss Thompson had said to him and asked her to speak to Mrs. Davidson. The missionary's attitude seemed rather arbitrary and it could do no harm if the girl were allowed to stay in Pago-Pago another fortnight. But he was not prepared for the result of his diplomacy. The missionary came to him straightway.

"Mrs. Davidson tells me that Thompson has been speaking to you."

Dr Macphail, thus directly tackled, had the shy man's resentment at being forced out into the open. He felt his temper rising, and he flushed.

"I don't see that it can make any difference if she goes to Sydney rather than to San Francisco, and so long as she promises to behave while she's here it's dashed hard to persecute her."

The missionary fixed him with his stern eyes.

"Why is she unwilling to go back to San Francisco?"

"I didn't enquire," answered the doctor with some asperity. "And I think one does better to mind one's own business."

Perhaps it was not a very tactful answer.

"The governor has ordered her to be deported by the first boat that leaves the island. He's only done his duty and I will not interfere. Her presence is a peril here."

"I think you're very harsh and tyrannical."

The two ladies looked up at the doctor with some alarm, but they need not have feared a quarrel, for the missionary smiled gently.

"I'm terribly sorry you should think that of me, Dr Macphail. Believe me, my heart bleeds for that unfortunate woman, but I'm only trying to do my duty."

The doctor made no answer. He looked out of the window sullenly. For once it was not raining and across the bay you saw nestling among the trees the huts of a native village.

"I think I'll take advantage of the rain stopping to go out," he said.

"Please don't bear me malice because I can't accede to your wish," said Davidson, with a melancholy smile. "I respect you very much, doctor, and I should be sorry if you thought ill of me."

"I have no doubt you have a sufficiently good opinion of yourself to bear mine with equanimity," he retorted.

"That's one on me," chuckled Davidson.

When Dr Macphail, vexed with himself because he had been uncivil to no purpose, went downstairs, Miss Thompson was waiting for him with her door ajar.

"Well," she said, "have you spoken to him?"

"Yes, I'm sorry, he won't do anything," he answered, not looking at her in his embarrassment.

But then he gave her a quick glance, for a sob broke from her. He saw that her face was white with fear. It gave him a shock of dismay. And suddenly he had an idea.

"But don't give up hope yet. I think it's a shame the way they're treating you and I'm going to see the governor myself."

"Now?"

He nodded. Her face brightened.

"Say, that's real good of you. I'm sure he'll let me stay if you speak for me. I just won't do a thing I didn't ought all the time I'm here."

Dr Macphail hardly knew why he had made up his mind to appeal to the governor. He was perfectly indifferent to Miss Thompson's affairs, but the missionary had irritated him, and with him temper was a smouldering thing. He found the governor at home. He was a large, handsome man, a sailor, with a grey toothbrush moustache; and he wore a spotless uniform of white drill.

"I've come to see you about a woman who's lodging in the same house as we are," he said. "Her name's Thompson."

"I guess I've heard nearly enough about her, Dr Macphail," said the governor, smiling. "I've given her the order to get out next Tuesday and that's all I can do."

"I wanted to ask you if you couldn't stretch a point and let her stay here till the boat comes in from San Francisco so that she can go to Sydney. I will guarantee her good behaviour."

The governor continued to smile, but his eyes grew small and serious.

"I'd be very glad to oblige you, Dr Macphail, but I've given the order and it must stand."

The doctor put the case as reasonably as he could, but now the governor ceased to smile at all. He listened sullenly, with averted gaze. Macphail saw that he was making no impression.

"I'm sorry to cause any lady inconvenience, but she'll have to sail on Tuesday and that's all there is to it."

"But what difference can it make?"

"Pardon me, doctor, but I don't feel called upon to explain my official actions except to the proper authorities."

Macphail looked at him shrewdly. He remembered Davidson's hint that he had used threats, and in the governor's attitude he read a singular embarrassment.

"Davidson's a damned busybody," he said hotly.

"Between ourselves, Dr Macphail, I don't say that I have formed a very favourable opinion of Mr. Davidson, but I am bound to confess that he was within his rights in pointing out to me the danger that the presence of a woman of Miss Thompson's character was to a place like this where a number of enlisted men are stationed among a native population."

He got up and Dr Macphail was obliged to do so too.

"I must ask you to excuse me. I have an engagement. Please give my respects to Mrs. Macphail."

The doctor left him crest-fallen. He knew that Miss Thompson would be waiting for him, and unwilling to tell her himself that he had failed, he went into the house by the back door and sneaked up the stairs as though he had something to hide.

At supper he was silent and ill-at-ease, but the missionary was jovial and animated. Dr Macphail thought his eyes rested on him now and then with triumphant good-humour. It struck him suddenly that Davidson knew of his visit to the governor and of its ill success. But how on earth could he have heard of it? There was something sinister about the power of that man. After supper he saw Horn on the verandah and, as though to have a casual word with him, went out.

"She wants to know if you've seen the governor," the trader whispered.

"Yes. He wouldn't do anything. I'm awfully sorry, I can't do anything more."

"I knew he wouldn't. They daren't go against the missionaries."

"What are you talking about?" said Davidson affably, coming out to join them.

"I was just saying there was no chance of your getting over to Apia for at least another week," said the trader glibly.

He left them, and the two men returned into the parlour. Mr. Davidson devoted one hour after each meal to recreation. Presently a timid knock was heard at the door.

"Come in," said Mrs. Davidson, in her sharp voice.

The door was not opened. She got up and opened it. They saw Miss Thompson standing at the threshold. But the change in her appearance was extraordinary. This was no longer the flaunting hussy who had jeered at them in the road, but a broken, frightened woman. Her hair, as a rule so elaborately arranged, was tumbling untidily over her neck. She wore bedroom slippers and a skirt and blouse. They were unfresh and bedraggled. She stood at the door with the tears streaming down her face and did not dare to enter.

"What do you want?" said Mrs. Davidson harshly.

"May I speak to Mr. Davidson?" she said in a choking voice.

The missionary rose and went towards her.

"Come right in, Miss Thompson," he said in cordial tones. "What can I do for you?"

She entered the room.

"Say, I'm sorry for what I said to you the other day an' for—for everythin' else. I guess I was a bit lit up. I beg pardon."

"Oh, it was nothing. I guess my back's broad enough to bear a few hard words."

She stepped towards him with a movement that was horribly cringing.

"You've got me beat. I'm all in. You won't make me go back to 'Frisco'?"

His genial manner vanished and his voice grew on a sudden hard and stern.

"Why don't you want to go back there?"

She cowered before him.

"I guess my people live there. I don't want them to see me like this. I'll go anywhere else you say."

"Why don't you want to go back to San Francisco?"

"I've told you."

He leaned forward, staring at her, and his great, shining eyes seemed to try to bore into her soul. He gave a sudden gasp.

"The penitentiary."

She screamed, and then she fell at his feet, clasping his legs.

"Don't send me back there. I swear to you before God I'll be a good woman. I'll give all this up."

She burst into a torrent of confused supplication and the tears coursed down her painted cheeks. He leaned over her and, lifting her face, forced her to look at him.

"Is that it, the penitentiary?"

"I beat it before they could get me," she gasped. "If the bulls grab me it's three years for mine."

He let go his hold of her and she fell in a heap on the floor, sobbing bitterly. Dr Macphail stood up.

"This alters the whole thing," he said. "You can't make her go back when you know this. Give her another chance. She wants to turn over a new leaf."

"I'm going to give her the finest chance she's ever had. If she repents let her accept her punishment."

She misunderstood the words and looked up. There was a gleam of hope in her heavy eyes.

"You'll let me go?"

"No. You shall sail for San Francisco on Tuesday."

She gave a groan of horror and then burst into low, hoarse shrieks which sounded hardly human, and she beat her head passionately on the ground. Dr Macphail sprang to her and lifted her up.

"Come on, you mustn't do that. You'd better go to your room and lie down. I'll get you something."

He raised her to her feet and partly dragging her, partly carrying her, got her downstairs. He was furious with Mrs. Davidson and with his wife because they made no effort to help. The half-caste was standing on the landing and with his assistance he managed to get her on the bed. She was moaning and crying. She was almost insensible. He gave her a hypodermic injection. He was hot and exhausted when he went upstairs again.

"I've got her to lie down."

The two women and Davidson were in the same positions as when he had left them. They could not have moved or spoken since he went.

"I was waiting for you," said Davidson, in a strange, distant voice. "I want you all to pray with me for the soul of our erring sister."

He took the Bible off a shelf, and sat down at the table at which they had supped. It had not been cleared, and he pushed the tea-pot out of the way. In a powerful voice, resonant and deep, he read to them the chapter in which is narrated the meeting of Jesus Christ with the woman taken in adultery.

"Now kneel with me and let us pray for the soul of our dear sister, Sadie Thompson."

He burst into a long, passionate prayer in which he implored God to have mercy on the sinful woman. Mrs. Macphail and Mrs. Davidson knelt with covered eyes. The doctor, taken by surprise, awkward and sheepish, knelt too. The missionary's prayer had a savage eloquence. He was extraordinarily moved, and as he spoke the tears ran down his cheeks. Outside, the pitiless rain fell, fell steadily, with a fierce malignity that was all too human.

At last he stopped. He paused for a moment and said:

"We will now repeat the Lord's prayer."

They said it and then; following him, they rose from their knees. Mrs. Davidson's face was pale and restful. She was comforted and at peace, but the Macphails felt suddenly bashful. They did not know which way to look.

"I'll just go down and see how she is now," said Dr Macphail.

When he knocked at her door it was opened for him by Horn. Miss Thompson was in a rocking-chair, sobbing quietly.

"What are you doing there?" exclaimed Macphail. "I told you to lie down."

"I can't lie down. I want to see Mr. Davidson."

"My poor child, what do you think is the good of it? You'll never move him."

"He said he'd come if I sent for him."

Macphail motioned to the trader.

"Go and fetch him."

He waited with her in silence while the trader went upstairs. Davidson came in.

"Excuse me for asking you to come here," she said, looking at him sombrely.

"I was expecting you to send for me. I knew the Lord would answer my prayer."

They stared at one another for a moment and then she looked away. She kept her eyes averted when she spoke.

"I've been a bad woman. I want to repent."

"Thank God! thank God! He has heard our prayers."

He turned to the two men.

"Leave me alone with her. Tell Mrs. Davidson that our prayers have been answered."

They went out and closed the door behind them.

"Gee whizz," said the trader.

That night Dr Macphail could not get to sleep till late, and when he heard the missionary come upstairs he looked at his watch. It was two o'clock. But even then he did not go to bed at once, for through the wooden partition that separated their rooms he heard him praying aloud, till he himself, exhausted, fell asleep.

When he saw him next morning he was surprised at his appearance. He was paler than ever, tired, but his eyes shone with an inhuman fire. It looked as though he were filled with an overwhelming joy.

"I want you to go down presently and see Sadie," he said. "I can't hope that her body is better, but her soul—her soul is transformed."

The doctor was feeling wan and nervous.

"You were with her very late last night," he said.

"Yes, she couldn't bear to have me leave her."

"You look as pleased as Punch," the doctor said irritably.

Davidson's eyes shone with ecstasy.

"A great mercy has been vouchsafed me. Last night I was privileged to bring a lost soul to the loving arms of Jesus."

Miss Thompson was again in the rocking-chair. The bed had not been made. The room was in disorder. She had not troubled to dress herself, but wore a dirty dressing-gown, and her hair was tied in a sluttish knot. She had given her face a dab with a wet towel, but it was all swollen and creased with crying. She looked a drab.

She raised her eyes dully when the doctor came in. She was cowed and broken.

"Where's Mr. Davidson?" she asked.

"He'll come presently if you want him," answered Macphail acidly. "I came here to see how you were."

"Oh, I guess I'm ok. You needn't worry about that."

"Have you had anything to eat?"

"Horn brought me some coffee."

She looked anxiously at the door.

"D'you think he'll come down soon? I feel as if it wasn't so terrible when he's with me."

"Are you still going on Tuesday?"

"Yes, he says I've got to go. Please tell him to come right along. You can't do me any good. He's the only one as can help me now."

"Very well," said Dr Macphail.

During the next three days the missionary spent almost all his time with Sadie Thompson. He joined the others only to have his meals. Dr Macphail noticed that he hardly ate.

"He's wearing himself out," said Mrs. Davidson pitifully. "He'll have a breakdown if he doesn't take care, but he won't spare himself."

She herself was white and pale. She told Mrs. Macphail that she had no sleep. When the missionary came upstairs from Miss Thompson he prayed till he was exhausted, but even then he did not sleep for long. After an hour or two he got up and dressed himself, and went for a tramp along the bay. He had strange dreams.

"This morning he told me that he'd been dreaming about the mountains of Nebraska," said Mrs. Davidson.

"That's curious," said Dr Macphail.

He remembered seeing them from the windows of the train when he crossed America. They were like huge mole-hills, rounded and smooth, and they rose from the plain abruptly. Dr Macphail remembered how it struck him that they were like a woman's breasts.

Davidson's restlessness was intolerable even to himself. But he was buoyed up by a wonderful exhilaration. He was tearing out by the roots the last vestiges of sin that lurked in the hidden corners of that poor woman's heart. He read with her and prayed with her.

"It's wonderful," he said to them one day at supper. "It's a true rebirth. Her soul, which was black as night, is now pure and white like the new-fallen snow. I am humble and afraid. Her remorse for all her sins is beautiful. I am not worthy to touch the hem of her garment."

"Have you the heart to send her back to San Francisco?" said the doctor. "Three years in an American prison. I should have thought you might have saved her from that."

"Ah, but don't you see? It's necessary. Do you think my heart doesn't bleed for her? I love her as I love my wife and my sister. All the time that she is in prison I shall suffer all the pain that she suffers."

"Bunkum," cried the doctor impatiently.

"You don't understand because you're blind. She's sinned, and she must suffer. I know what she'll endure. She'll be starved and tortured and humiliated. I want her to accept the punishment of man as a sacrifice to God. I want her to accept it joyfully. She has an opportunity which is offered to very few of us. God is very good and very merciful."

Davidson's voice trembled with excitement. He could hardly articulate the words that tumbled passionately from his lips.

"All day I pray with her and when I leave her I pray again, I pray with all my might and main, so that Jesus may grant her this great mercy. I want to put in her heart the passionate desire to be punished so that at the end, even if I offered to let her go, she would refuse. I want her to feel that the bitter punishment of prison is the thank-offering that she places at the feet of our Blessed Lord, who gave his life for her."

The days passed slowly. The whole household, intent on the wretched, tortured woman downstairs, lived in a state of unnatural excitement. She was like a victim that was being prepared for the savage rites of a bloody idolatry. Her terror numbed her. She could not bear to let Davidson out of her sight; it was only when he was with her that she had courage, and she hung upon him with a slavish dependence. She cried a great deal, and she read the Bible, and prayed. Sometimes she was exhausted and apathetic. Then she did indeed look forward to her ordeal, for it seemed to offer an escape, direct and concrete, from the anguish she was enduring. She could not bear much longer the vague terrors which now assailed her. With her sins she had put aside all personal vanity, and she slopped about her room, unkempt and dishevelled, in her tawdry dressing-gown. She had not taken off her night-dress for four days, nor put on stockings. Her room was littered and untidy. Meanwhile the rain fell with a cruel persistence. You felt that the heavens must at last be empty of water, but still it poured down, straight and heavy, with a maddening iteration, on the iron roof. Everything was damp and clammy. There was mildew on the walls and on the boots that stood on the floor. Through the sleepless nights the mosquitoes droned their angry chant.

"If it would only stop raining for a single day it wouldn't be so bad," said Dr Macphail.

They all looked forward to the Tuesday when the boat for San Francisco was to arrive from Sydney. The strain was intolerable. So far as Dr Macphail was concerned, his pity and his resentment were alike extinguished by his desire to be rid of the unfortunate woman. The inevitable must be accepted. He felt he would breathe more freely when the ship had sailed. Sadie Thompson was to be escorted on board by a clerk in the governor's office. This person called on the Monday evening and told Miss Thompson to be prepared at eleven in the morning. Davidson was with her.

"I'll see that everything is ready. I mean to come on board with her myself."

Miss Thompson did not speak.

When Dr Macphail blew out his candle and crawled cautiously under his mosquito curtains, he gave a sigh of relief.

"Well, thank God that's over. By this time to-morrow she'll be gone."

"Mrs. Davidson will be glad too. She says he's wearing himself to a shadow," said Mrs. Macphail. "She's a different woman."

"Who?"

"Sadie. I should never have thought it possible. It makes one humble."

Dr Macphail did not answer, and presently he fell asleep. He was tired out, and he slept more soundly than usual.

He was awakened in the morning by a hand placed on his arm, and, starting up, saw Horn by the side of his bed. The trader put his finger on his mouth to prevent any exclamation from Dr Macphail and beckoned to him to come. As a rule he wore shabby ducks, but now he was barefoot and wore only the lava-lava of the natives. He looked suddenly savage, and Dr Macphail, getting out of bed, saw that he was heavily tattooed. Horn made him a sign to come on to the verandah. Dr Macphail got out of bed and followed the trader out.

"Don't make a noise," he whispered. "You're wanted. Put on a coat and some shoes. Quick."

Dr Macphail's first thought was that something had happened to Miss Thompson.

"What is it? Shall I bring my instruments?"

"Hurry, please, hurry."

Dr Macphail crept back into the bedroom, put on a waterproof over his pyjamas, and a pair of rubber-soled shoes. He rejoined the trader, and together they tiptoed down the stairs. The door leading out to the road was open and at it were standing half a dozen natives.

"What is it?" repeated the doctor.

"Come along with me," said Horn.

He walked out and the doctor followed him. The natives came after them in a little bunch. They crossed the road and came on to the beach. The doctor saw a group of natives standing round some object at the water's edge. They hurried along, a couple of dozen yards perhaps, and the natives opened out as the doctor came up. The trader pushed him forwards. Then he saw, lying half in the water and half out, a dreadful object, the body of Davidson. Dr Macphail bent down—he was not a man to lose his head in an emergency—and turned the body over. The throat was cut from ear to ear, and in the right hand was still the razor with which the deed was done.

"He's quite cold," said the doctor. "He must have been dead some time."

"One of the boys saw him lying there on his way to work just now and came and told me. Do you think he did it himself?"

"Yes. Someone ought to go for the police."

Horn said something in the native tongue, and two youths started off.

"We must leave him here till they come," said the doctor.

"They mustn't take him into my house. I won't have him in my house."

"You'll do what the authorities say," replied the doctor sharply. "In point of fact I expect they'll take him to the mortuary."

They stood waiting where they were. The trader took a cigarette from a fold in his lava-lava and gave one to Dr Macphail. They smoked while they stared at the corpse. Dr Macphail could not understand.

"Why do you think he did it?" asked Horn.

The doctor shrugged his shoulders. In a little while native police came along, under the charge of a marine, with a stretcher, and immediately afterwards a couple of naval officers and a naval doctor. They managed everything in a businesslike manner.

"What about the wife?" said one of the officers.

"Now that you've come I'll go back to the house and get some things on. I'll see that it's broken to her. She'd better not see him till he's been fixed up a little."

"I guess that's right," said the naval doctor.

When Dr Macphail went back he found his wife nearly dressed.

"Mrs. Davidson's in a dreadful state about her husband," she said to him as soon as he appeared. "He hasn't been to bed all night. She heard him leave Miss Thompson's room at two, but he went out. If he's been walking about since then he'll be absolutely dead."

Dr Macphail told her what had happened and asked her to break the news to Mrs. Davidson.

"But why did he do it?" she asked, horror-stricken.

"I don't know."

"But I can't. I can't."

"You must."

She gave him a frightened look and went out. He heard her go into Mrs. Davidson's room. He waited a minute to gather himself together and then began to shave and wash. When he was dressed he sat down on the bed and waited for his wife. At last she came.

"She wants to see him," she said.

"They've taken him to the mortuary. We'd better go down with her. How did she take it?"

"I think she's stunned. She didn't cry. But she's trembling like a leaf."

"We'd better go at once."

When they knocked at her door Mrs. Davidson came out. She was very pale, but dry-eyed. To the doctor she seemed unnaturally composed. No word was exchanged, and they set out in silence down the road. When they arrived at the mortuary Mrs. Davidson spoke.

"Let me go in and see him alone."

They stood aside. A native opened a door for her and closed it behind her. They sat down and waited. One or two white men came and talked to them in undertones. Dr Macphail told them again what he knew of the tragedy. At last the door was quietly opened and Mrs. Davidson came out. Silence fell upon them.

"I'm ready to go back now," she said.

Her voice was hard and steady. Dr Macphail could not understand the look in her eyes. Her pale face was very stern. They walked back slowly, never saying a word, and at last they came round the bend on the other side of which stood their house. Mrs. Davidson gave a gasp, and for a moment they stopped still. An incredible sound assaulted their ears. The gramophone which had been silent for so long was playing, playing ragtime loud and harsh.

"What's that?" cried Mrs. Macphail with horror.

"Let's go on," said Mrs. Davidson.

They walked up the steps and entered the hall. Miss Thompson was standing at her door, chatting with a sailor. A sudden change had taken place in her. She was no longer the cowed drudge of the last days. She was dressed in all her finery, in her white dress, with the high shiny boots over which her fat legs bulged in their cotton stockings; her hair was elaborately arranged; and she wore that enormous hat covered with gaudy flowers. Her face was painted, her eyebrows were boldly black, and her lips were scarlet. She held herself erect. She was the flaunting quean that they had known at first. As they came in she broke into a loud, jeering laugh; and then, when Mrs. Davidson involuntarily stopped, she collected the spittle in her mouth and spat. Mrs. Davidson cowered back, and two red spots rose suddenly to her cheeks. Then, covering her face with her hands, she broke away and ran quickly up the stairs. Dr Macphail was outraged. He pushed past the woman into her room.

"What the devil are you doing?" he cried. "Stop that damned machine."

He went up to it and tore the record off. She turned on him.

"Say, doc, you can that stuff with me. What the hell are you doin' in my room?"

"What do you mean?" he cried. "What d'you mean?"

She gathered herself together. No one could describe the scorn of her expression or the contemptuous hatred she put into her answer.

"You men! You filthy, dirty pigs! You're all the same, all of you. Pigs! Pigs!"

Dr Macphail gasped. He understood.





Virtue


There are few things better than a good Havana. When I was young and very poor and smoked a cigar only when somebody gave me one, I determined that if ever I had money I would smoke a cigar every day after luncheon and after dinner. This is the only resolution of my youth that I have kept. It is the only ambition I have achieved that has never been embittered by disillusion. I like a cigar that is mild, but full-flavoured, neither so small that it is finished before you have become aware of it nor so large as to be irksome, rolled so that it draws without consciousness of effort on your part, with a leaf so firm that it doesn't become messy on your lips, and in such condition that it keeps its savour to the very end. But when you have taken the last pull and put down the shapeless stump and watched the final cloud of smoke dwindle blue in the surrounding air it is impossible, if you have a sensitive nature, not to feel a certain melancholy at the thought of all the labour, the care and pains that have gone, the thought, the trouble, the complicated organization that have been required to provide you with half an hour's delight. For this men have sweltered long years under tropical suns and ships have scoured the seven seas. These reflections become more poignant still when you are eating a dozen oysters (with half a bottle of dry white wine), and they become almost unbearable when it comes to a lamb cutlet. For these are animals and there is something that inspires awe in the thought that since the surface of the earth became capable of supporting life from generation to generation for millions upon millions of years creatures have come into existence to end at last upon a plate of crushed ice or on a silver grill. It may be that a sluggish fancy cannot grasp the dreadful solemnity of eating an oyster and evolution has taught us that the bivalve has through the ages kept itself to itself in a manner that inevitably alienates sympathy. There is an aloofness in it that is offensive to the aspiring spirit of man and a self-complacency that is obnoxious to his vanity. But I do not know how anyone can look upon a lamb cutlet without thoughts too deep for tears: here man himself has taken a hand and the history of the race is bound up with the tender morsel on your plate.

And sometimes even the fate of human beings is curious to consider. It is strange to look upon this man or that, the quiet ordinary persons of every day, the bank clerk, the dustman, the middle-aged girl in the second row of the chorus, and think of the interminable history behind them and of the long, long series of hazards by which from the primeval slime the course of events has brought them at this moment to such and such a place. When such tremendous vicissitudes have been needed to get them here at all one would have thought some huge significance must be attached to them; one would have thought that what befell them must matter a little to the Life Spirit or whatever else it is that has produced them. An accident befalls them. The thread is broken. The story that began with the world is finished abruptly and it looks as though it meant nothing at all. A tale told by an idiot. And is it not odd that this event, of an importance so dramatic, may be brought about by a cause so trivial?

An incident of no moment, that might easily not have happened, has consequences that are incalculable. It looks as though blind chance ruled all things. Our smallest actions may affect profoundly the whole lives of people who have nothing to do with us. The story I have to tell would never have happened if one day I had not walked across the street. Life is really very fantastic and one has to have a peculiar sense of humour to see the fun of it.

I was strolling down Bond Street one spring morning and having nothing much to do till lunch-time thought I would look in at Sotheby's, the auction rooms, to see whether there was anything on show that interested me. There was a block in the traffic and I threaded my way through the cars. When I reached the other side I ran into a man I had known in Borneo coming out of a hatter's.

"Hullo, Morton," I said. "When did you come home?"

"I've been back about a week."

He was a District Officer. The Governor had given me a letter of introduction to him and I wrote and told him I meant to spend a week at the place he lived at and should like to put up at the government rest-house. He met me on the ship when I arrived and asked me to stay with him. I demurred. I did not see how I could spend a week with a total stranger, I did not want to put him to the expense of my board, and besides I thought I should have more freedom if I were on my own. He would not listen to me.

"I've got plenty of room," he said, "and the rest-house is beastly. I haven't spoken to a white man for six months and I'm fed to the teeth with my own company."

But when Morton had got me and his launch had landed us at the bungalow and he had offered me a drink he did not in the least know what to do with me. He was seized on a sudden with shyness, and his conversation, which had been fluent and ready, ran dry. I did my best to make him feel at home (it was the least I could do, considering that it was his own house) and asked him if he had any new records. He turned on the gramophone and the sound of rag-time gave him confidence.

His bungalow overlooked the river and his living-room was a large veranda. It was furnished in the impersonal fashion that characterized the dwellings of government officials who were moved here and there at little notice according to the exigencies of the service. There were native hats as ornaments on the walls and the horns of animals, blow-pipes, and spears. In the book-shelf were detective novels and old magazines. There was a cottage piano with yellow keys. It was very untidy, but not uncomfortable.

Unfortunately I cannot very well remember what he looked like. He was young, twenty-eight, I learnt later, and he had a boyish and attractive smile. I spent an agreeable week with him. We went up and down the river and we climbed a mountain. We had tiffin one day with some planters who lived twenty miles away and every evening we went to the club. The only members were the manager of a kutch factory and his assistants, but they were not on speaking terms with one another and it was only on Morton's representations that they must not let him down when he had a visitor that we could get up a rubber of bridge. The atmosphere was strained. We came back to dinner, listened to the gramophone, and went to bed. Morton had little office work and one would have thought the time hung heavy on his hands, but he had energy and high spirits; it was his first post of the sort and he was happy to be independent. His only anxiety was lest he should be transferred before he had finished a road he was building. This was the joy of his heart. It was his own idea and he had wheedled the government into giving him the money to make it; he had surveyed the country himself and traced the path. He had solved unaided the technical problems that presented themselves. Every morning, before he went to his office, he drove out in a rickety old Ford to where the coolies were working and watched the progress that had been made since the day before. He thought of nothing else. He dreamt of it at night. He reckoned that it would be finished in a year and he did not want to take his leave till then. He could not have worked with more zest if he had been a painter or a sculptor creating a work of art. I think it was this eagerness that made me take a fancy to him. I liked his zeal. I liked his ingenuousness. And I was impressed by the passion for achievement that made him indifferent to the solitariness of his life, to promotion, and even to the thought of going home. I forget how long the road was, fifteen or twenty miles, I think, and I forget what purpose it was to serve. I don't believe Morton cared very much. His passion was the artist's and his triumph was the triumph of man over nature. He learnt as he went along. He had the jungle to contend against, torrential rains that destroyed the labour of weeks, accidents of topography; he had to collect his labour and hold it together; he had inadequate funds. His imagination sustained him. His labours gained a sort of epic quality and the vicissitudes of the work were a great saga that unrolled itself with an infinity of episodes.

His only complaint was that the day was too short. He had office duties, he was judge and tax collector, father and mother (at twenty-eight) of the people in his district; he had now and then to make tours that took him away from home. Unless he was on the spot nothing was done. He would have liked to be there twenty-four hours a day driving the reluctant coolies to further effort. It so happened that shortly before I arrived an incident had occurred that filled him with jubilation. He had offered a contract to a Chinese to make a certain section of the road and the Chinese had asked more than Morton could afford to pay. Notwithstanding interminable discussions they had been unable to arrive at an agreement and Morton with rage in his heart saw his work held up. He was at his wits' end. Then going down to his office one morning, he heard that there had been a row in one of the Chinese gambling houses the night before. A coolie had been badly wounded and his assailant was under arrest. This assailant was the contractor. He was brought into court, the evidence was clear, and Morton sentenced him to eighteen months' hard labour.

"Now he'll have to build the blasted road for nothing," said Morton, his eyes glistening when he told me the story.

We saw the fellow at work one morning, in the prison sarong, unconcerned. He was taking his misfortune in good part.

"I've told him I'll remit the rest of his sentence when the road's finished," said Morton, "and he's as pleased as Punch. Bit of a snip for me, eh, what?"

When I left Morton I asked him to let me know when he came to England and he promised to write to me as soon as he landed. On the spur of the moment one gives these invitations and one is perfectly sincere about them. But when one is taken at one's word a slight dismay seizes one. People are so different at home from what they are abroad. There they are easy, cordial, and natural. They have interesting things to tell you. They are immensely kind. You are anxious when your turn comes to do something in return for the hospitality you have received. But it is not easy. The persons who were so entertaining in their own surroundings are very dull in yours. They are constrained and shy. You introduce them to your friends and your friends find them a crashing bore. They do their best to be civil, but sigh with relief when the strangers go and the conversation can once more run easily in its accustomed channels. I think the residents in far places early in their careers understand the situation pretty well, as the result maybe of bitter and humiliating experiences, for I have found that they seldom take advantage of the invitation which on some outstation on the edge of the jungle has been so cordially extended to them and by them as cordially accepted. But Morton was different. He was a young man and single. It is generally the wives that are the difficulty; other women look at their drab clothes, in a glance take in their provincial air, and freeze them with their indifference. But a man can play bridge and tennis, and dance. Morton had charm. I had had no doubt that in a day or two he would find his feet.

"Why didn't you let me know you were back?" I asked him.

"I thought you wouldn't want to be bothered with me," he smiled.

"What nonsense!"

Of course now as we stood in Bond Street on the kerb and chatted for a minute he looked strange to me. I had never seen him in anything but khaki shorts and a tennis shirt, except when we got back from the club at night and he put on a pyjama jacket and a sarong for dinner. It is as comfortable a form of evening dress as has ever been devised. He looked a bit awkward in his blue serge suit. His face against a white collar was very brown.

"How about the road?" I asked him.

"Finished. I was afraid I'd have to postpone my leave, we struck one or two snags towards the end, but I made 'em hustle and the day before I left I drove the Ford to the end and back without stopping."

I laughed. His pleasure was charming.

"What have you been doing with yourself in London?"

"Buying clothes."

"Been having a good time?"

"Marvellous. A bit lonely, you know, but I don't mind that. I've been to a show every night. The Palmers, you know, I think you met them in Sarawak, were going to be in town and we were going to do the play together, but they had to go to Scotland because her mother's ill."

His words, said so breezily, cut me to the quick. His was the common experience. It was heartbreaking. For months, for long months before it was due, these people planned their leave, and when they got off the ship they were in such spirits they could hardly contain themselves. London. Shops and clubs and theatres and restaurants. London. They were going to have the time of their lives. London. It swallowed them. A strange turbulent city, not hostile but indifferent, and they were lost in it. They had no friends. They had nothing in common with the acquaintances they made. They were more lonely than in the jungle. It was a relief when at a theatre they ran across someone they had known in the East (and perhaps been bored stiff by or disliked) and they could fix up an evening together and have a good laugh and tell one another what a grand time they were having and talk of common friends and at last confide to one another a little shyly that they would not be sorry when their leave was up and they were once again in harness. They went to see their families and of course they were glad to see them, but it wasn't the same as it had been, they did feel a bit out of it, and when you came down to brass tacks the life people led in England was deadly. It was grand fun to come home, but you couldn't live there any more, and sometimes you thought of your bungalow overlooking the river and your tours of the district and what a lark it was to run over once in a blue moon to Sandakan or Kuching or Singapore.

And because I remembered what Morton had looked forward to when, the road finished and off his chest, he went on leave, I could not but feel a pang when I thought of him dining by himself in a dismal club where he knew nobody or alone in a restaurant in Soho and then going off to see a play with no one by his side with whom he could enjoy it and no one to have a drink with during the interval. And at the same time I reflected that even if I had known he was in London I could have done nothing much for him, for during the last week I had not had a moment free. That very evening I was dining with friends and going to a play, and the next day I was going abroad.

"What are you doing tonight?" I asked him.

"I'm going to the Pavilion. It's packed jammed full, but there's a fellow over the road who's wonderful and he's got me a ticket that had been returned. You can often get one seat, you know, when you can't get two."

"Why don't you come and have supper with me? I'm taking some people to the Haymarket and we're going on to Ciro's afterwards."

"I'd love to."

We arranged to meet at eleven and I left him to keep an engagement.

I was afraid the friends I had asked him to meet would not amuse Morton very much, for they were distinctly middle-aged, but I could not think of anyone young that at this season of the year I should be likely to get hold of at the last moment. None of the girls I knew would thank me for asking her to supper to dance with a shy young man from Malaya. I could trust the Bishops to do their best for him, and after all it must be jollier for him to have supper in a club with a good band where he could see pretty women dancing than to go home to bed at eleven because he had nowhere else in the world to go. I had known Charlie Bishop first when I was a medical student. He was then a thin fellow with sandy hair and blunt features; he had fine eyes, dark and gleaming, but he wore spectacles. He had a round, merry, red face. He was very fond of the girls. I suppose he had a way with him, for, with no money and no looks, he managed to pick up a succession of young persons who gratified his roving desires. He was clever and bumptious, argumentative and quick-tempered. He had a caustic tongue. Looking back, I should say he was a rather disagreeable young man, but I do not think he was a bore. Now, half-way through the fifties, he was inclined to be stout and he was very bald, but his eyes behind the gold-rimmed spectacles were still bright and alert. He was dogmatic and somewhat conceited, argumentative still and caustic, but he was good-natured and amusing. After you have known a person so long his idiosyncrasies cease to trouble you. You accept them as you accept your own physical defects. He was by profession a pathologist and now and then he sent me a slim book he had just published. It was severe and extremely technical and grimly illustrated with photographs of bacteria. I did not read it. I gathered from what I sometimes heard that Charlie's views on the subjects with which he dealt were unsound. I do not believe that he was very popular with the other members of his profession, he made no secret of the fact that he looked upon them as a set of incompetent idiots; but he had his job, it brought him in six or eight hundred a year, I think, and he was completely indifferent to other people's opinion of him.

I liked Charlie Bishop because I had known him for thirty years, but I liked Margery, his wife, because she was very nice. I was extremely surprised when he told me he was going to be married. He was hard on forty at the time and so fickle in his affections that I had made up my mind he would remain single. He was very fond of women, but he was not in the least sentimental, and his aims were loose. His views on the female sex would in these idealistic days be thought crude. He knew what he wanted and he asked for it, and if he couldn't get it for love or money he shrugged his shoulders and went his way. To be brief, he did not look to women to gratify his ideal but to provide him with fornication. It was odd that though small and plain he found so many who were prepared to grant his wishes. For his spiritual needs he found satisfaction in unicellular organisms. He had always been a man who spoke to the point, and when he told me he was going to marry a young woman called Margery Hobson I did not hesitate to ask him why. He grinned.

"Three reasons. First, she won't let me go to bed with her without. Second, she makes me laugh like a hyena. And third, she's alone in the world, without a single relation, and she must have someone to take care of her."

"The first reason is just swank and the second is eyewash. The third is the real one and it means that she's got you by the short hairs."

His eyes gleamed softly behind his large spectacles.

"I shouldn't be surprised if you weren't dead right."

"She's not only got you by the short hairs but you're as pleased as Punch that she has."

"Come and lunch tomorrow and have a look at her. She's easy on the eye."

Charlie was a member of a cock-and-hen club which at that time I used a good deal and we arranged to lunch there. I found Margery a very attractive young woman. She was then just under thirty. She was a lady. I noticed the fact with satisfaction, but with a certain astonishment, for it had not escaped my notice that Charlie was attracted as a rule by women whose breeding left something to be desired. She was not beautiful, but comely, with fine dark hair and fine eyes, a good colour and a look of health. She had a pleasant frankness and an air of candour that were very taking. She looked honest, simple, and dependable. I took an immediate liking to her. She was easy to talk to and though she did not say anything very brilliant she understood what other people were talking about; she was quick to see a joke and she was not shy. She gave you the impression of being competent and business-like. She had a happy placidity that suggested a good temper and an excellent digestion.

They seemed extremely pleased with one another. I had asked myself when I first saw her why Margery was marrying this irritable little man, baldish already and by no means young, but I discovered very soon that it was because she was in love with him. They chaffed one another a good deal and laughed a lot and every now and then their eyes met more significantly and they seemed to exchange a little private message. It was really rather touching.

A week later they were married at a registrar's office. It was a very successful marriage. Looking back now after sixteen years I could not but chuckle sympathetically at the thought of the lark they had made of their life together. I had never known a more devoted couple. They had never had very much money. They never seemed to want any. They had no ambitions. Their life was a picnic that never came to an end. They lived in the smallest flat I ever saw, in Panton Street, a small bedroom, a small sitting-room, and a bathroom that served also as a kitchen. But they had no sense of home, they ate their meals in restaurants, and only had breakfast in the flat. It was merely a place to sleep in. It was comfortable, though a third person coming in for a whisky and soda crowded it, and Margery with the help of a charwoman kept it as neat as Charlie's untidiness permitted, but there was not a single thing in it that had a personal note. They had a tiny car and whenever Charlie had a holiday they took it across the Channel and started off, with a bag each for all their luggage, to drive wherever the fancy took them. Breakdowns never disturbed them, bad weather was part of the fun, a puncture was no end of a joke, and if they lost their way and had to sleep out in the open they thought they were having the time of their lives.

Charlie continued to be irascible and contentious, but nothing he did ever disturbed Margery's lovely placidity. She could calm him with a word. She still made him laugh. She typed his monographs on obscure bacteria and corrected the proofs of his articles in the scientific magazines. Once I asked them if they ever quarrelled.

"No," she said, "we never seem to have anything to quarrel about. Charlie has the temper of an angel."

"Nonsense," I said, "he's an overbearing, aggressive, and cantankerous fellow. He always has been."

She looked at him and giggled and I saw that she thought I was being funny.

"Let him rave," said Charlie. "He's an ignorant fool and he uses words of whose meaning he hasn't the smallest idea."

They were sweet together. They were very happy in one another's company and were never apart if they could help it. Even after the long time they had been married Charlie used to get into the car every day at luncheon-time to come west and meet Margery at a restaurant. People used to laugh at them, not unkindly, but perhaps with a little catch in the throat, because when they were asked to go and spend a week-end in the country Margery would write to the hostess and say they would like to come if they could be given a double bed. They had slept together for so many years that neither of them could sleep alone. It was often a trifle awkward. Husbands and wives as a rule not only demanded separate rooms, but were inclined to be peevish if asked to share the same bathroom. Modern houses were not arranged for domestic couples, but among their friends it became an understood thing that if you wanted the Bishops you must give them a room with a double bed. Some people of course thought it a little indecent, and it was never convenient, but they were a pleasant pair to have to stay and it was worth while to put up with their crankiness. Charlie was always full of spirits and in his caustic way extremely amusing, and Margery was peaceful and easy. They were no trouble to entertain. Nothing pleased them more than to be left to go out together for a long ramble in the country.

When a man marries, his wife sooner or later estranges him from his old friends, but Margery on the contrary increased Charlie's intimacy with them. By making him more tolerant she made him a more agreeable companion. They gave you the impression not of a married couple, but, rather amusingly, of two middle-aged bachelors living together; and when Margery, as was the rule, found herself the only woman among half a dozen men, ribald, argumentative, and gay, she was not a bar to good-fellowship but an asset. Whenever I was in England I saw them. They generally dined at the club of which I have spoken and if I happened to be alone I joined them.

When we met that evening for a snack before going to the play I told them I had asked Morton to come to supper.

"I'm afraid you'll find him rather dull," I said. "But he's a very decent sort of boy and he was awfully kind to me when I was in Borneo."

"Why didn't you let me know sooner?" cried Margery. "I'd have brought a girl along."

"What do you want a girl for?" said Charlie. "There'll be you."

"I don't think it can be much fun for a young man to dance with a woman of my advanced years," said Margery.

"Rot. What's your age got to do with it?" He turned to me. "Have you ever danced with anyone who danced better?"

I had, but she certainly danced very well. She was light on her feet and she had a good sense of rhythm.

"Never," I said heartily.

Morton was waiting for us when we reached Ciro's. He looked very sunburned in his evening clothes. Perhaps it was because I knew that they had been wrapped away in a tin box with mothballs for four years that I felt he did not look quite at home in them. He was certainly more at ease in khaki shorts. Charlie Bishop was a good talker and liked to hear himself speak. Morton was shy. I gave him a cocktail and ordered some champagne. I had a feeling that he would be glad to dance, but was not quite sure whether it would occur to him to ask Margery. I was acutely conscious that we all belonged to another generation.

"I think I should tell you that Mrs. Bishop is a beautiful dancer," I said.

"Is she?" He flushed a little. "Will you dance with me?"

She got up and they took the floor. She was looking peculiarly nice that evening, not at all smart, and I do not think her plain black dress had cost more than six guineas, but she looked a lady. She had the advantage of having extremely good legs and at that time skirts were still being worn very short. I suppose she had a little make-up on, but in contrast with the other women there she looked very natural. Shingled hair suited her; it was not even touched with white and it had an attractive sheen. She was not a pretty woman, but her kindliness, her wholesome air, her good health gave you, if not the illusion that she was, at least the feeling that it didn't at all matter. When she came back to the table her eyes were bright and she had a heightened colour.

"How does he dance?" asked her husband.

"Divinely."

"You're very easy to dance with," said Morton.

Charlie went on with his discourse. He had a sardonic humour and he was interesting because he was himself so interested in what he said. But he spoke of things that Morton knew nothing about and though he listened with a civil show of interest I could see that he was too much excited by the gaiety of the scene, the music, and the champagne to give his attention to conversation. When the music struck up again his eyes immediately sought Margery's. Charlie caught the look and smiled.

"Dance with him, Margery. Good for my figure to see you take exercise."

They set off again and for a moment Charlie watched her with fond eyes.

"Margery's having the time of her life. She loves dancing and it makes me puff and blow. Not a bad youth."

My little party was quite a success and when Morton and I, having taken leave of the Bishops, walked together towards Piccadilly Circus he thanked me warmly. He had really enjoyed himself. I said good-bye to him. Next morning I went abroad.

I was sorry not to have been able to do more for Morton and I knew that when I returned he would be on his way back to Borneo. I gave him a passing thought now and then, but by the autumn when I got home he had slipped my memory. After I had been in London a week or so I happened to drop in one night at the club to which Charlie Bishop also belonged. He was sitting with three or four men I knew and I went up. I had not seen any of them since my return. One of them, a man called Bill Marsh, whose wife, Janet, was a great friend of mine, asked me to have a drink.

"Where have you sprung from?" asked Charlie. "Haven't seen you about lately."

I noticed at once that he was drunk. I was astonished. Charlie had always liked his liquor, but he carried it well and never exceeded. In years gone by, when we were very young, he got tight occasionally, but probably more than anything to show what a great fellow he was, and it is unfair to bring up against a man the excesses of his youth. But I remembered that Charlie had never been very nice when he was drunk: his natural aggressiveness was exaggerated then and he talked too much and too loud; he was very apt to be quarrelsome. He was very dogmatic now, laying down the law and refusing to listen to any of the objections his rash statements called forth. The others knew he was drunk and were struggling between the irritation his cantankerousness aroused in them and the good-natured tolerance which they felt his condition demanded. He was not an agreeable object. A man of that age, bald and fattish, with spectacles, is disgusting drunk. He was generally rather dapper, but he was untidy now and there was tobacco ash all over him. Charlie called the waiter and ordered another whisky. The waiter had been at the club for thirty years.

"You've got one in front of you, sir."

"Mind your own damned business," said Charlie Bishop. "Bring me a double whisky right away or I'll report you to the secretary for insolence."

"Very good, sir," said the waiter.

Charlie emptied his glass at a gulp, but his hand was unsteady and he spilled some of the whisky over himself.

"Well, Charlie, old boy, we'd better be toddling along," said Bill Marsh. He turned to me. "Charlie's staying with us for a bit."

I was more surprised still. But I felt that something was wrong and thought it safer not to say anything.

"I'm ready," said Charlie. "I'll just have another drink before I go. I shall have a better night if I do."

It did not look to me as though the party would break up for some time, so I got up and announced that I meant to stroll home.

"I say," said Bill, as I was about to go, "you wouldn't come and dine with us tomorrow night, would you, just me and Janet and Charlie?"

"Yes, I'll come with pleasure," I said.

It was evident that something was up.

The Marshes lived in a terrace on the East side of Regent's Park. The maid who opened the door for me asked me to go in to Mr. Marsh's study. He was waiting for me there.

"I thought I'd better have a word with you before you went upstairs," he said as he shook hands with me. "You know Margery's left Charlie?"

"No!"

"He's taken it very hard. Janet thought it was so awful for him alone in that beastly little flat that we asked him to stay here for a bit. We've done everything we could for him. He's been drinking like a fish. He hasn't slept a wink for a fortnight."

"But she hasn't left him for good?"

I was astounded.

"Yes. She's crazy about a fellow called Morton."

"Morton. Who's he?"

It never struck me it was my friend from Borneo.

"Damn it all, you introduced him and a pretty piece of work you did. Let's go upstairs. I thought I'd better put you wise."

He opened the door and we went out. I was thoroughly confused.

"But look here," I said.

"Ask Janet. She knows the whole thing. It beats me. I've got no patience with Margery, and he must be a mess."

He preceded me into the drawing-room. Janet Marsh rose as I entered and came forward to greet me. Charlie was sitting at the window, reading the evening paper; he put it aside as I went up to him and shook his hand. He was quite sober and he spoke in his usual rather perky manner, but I noticed that he looked very ill. We had a glass of sherry and went down to dinner. Janet was a woman of spirit. She was tall and fair and good to look at. She kept the conversation going with alertness. When she left us to drink a glass of port it was with instructions not to stay more than ten minutes. Bill, as a rule somewhat taciturn, exerted himself now to talk. I tumbled to the game. I was hampered by my ignorance of what exactly had happened, but it was plain that the Marshes wanted to prevent Charlie from brooding, and I did my best to interest him. He seemed willing to play his part, he was always fond of holding forth, and he discussed, from the pathologist's standpoint, a murder that was just then absorbing the public. But he spoke without life. He was an empty shell, and one had the feeling that though for the sake of his host he forced himself to speak, his thoughts were elsewhere. It was a relief when a knocking on the floor above indicated to us that Janet was getting impatient. This was an occasion when a woman's presence eased the situation. We went upstairs and played family bridge. When it was time for me to go Charlie said he would walk with me as far as the Marylebone Road.

"Oh, Charlie, it's so late, you'd much better go to bed," said Janet.

"I shall sleep better if I have a stroll before turning in," he replied.

She gave him a worried look. You cannot forbid a middle-aged professor of pathology from going for a little walk if he wants to. She glanced brightly at her husband.

"I daresay it'll do Bill no harm."

I think the remark was tactless. Women are often a little too managing. Charlie gave her a sullen look.

"There's absolutely no need to drag Bill out," he said with some firmness.

"I haven't the smallest intention of coming," said Bill, smiling. "I'm tired out and I'm going to hit the hay."

I fancy we left Bill Marsh and his wife to a little argument.

"They've been frightfully kind to me," said Charlie, as we walked along by the railings. "I don't know what I should have done without them. I haven't slept for a fortnight."

I expressed regret but did not ask the reason, and we walked for a little in silence. I presumed that he had come with me in order to talk to me of what had happened, but I felt that he must take his own time. I was anxious to show my sympathy, but afraid of saying the wrong things; I did not want to seem eager to extract confidences from him. I did not know how to give him a lead. I was sure he did not want one. He was not a man given to beating about the bush. I imagined that he was choosing his words. We reached the corner.

"You'll be able to get a taxi at the church," he said. "I'll walk on a bit further. Good night."

He nodded and slouched off. I was taken aback. There was nothing for me to do but to stroll on till I found a cab. I was having my bath next morning when a telephone call dragged me out of it, and with a towel round my wet body I took up the receiver. It was Janet.

"Well, what do you think of it all?" she said. "You seem to have kept Charlie up pretty late last night. I heard him come home at three."

"He left me at the Marylebone Road," I answered. "He said nothing to me at all."

"Didn't he?"

There was something in Janet's voice that suggested that she was prepared to have a long talk with me. I suspected she had a telephone by the side of her bed.

"Look here," I said quickly. "I'm having my bath."

"Oh, have you got a telephone in your bathroom?" she answered eagerly, and I think with envy.

"No, I haven't." I was abrupt and firm. "And I'm dripping all over the carpet."

"Oh!" I felt disappointment in her tone and a trace of irritation. "Well, when can I see you? Can you come here at twelve?"

It was inconvenient, but I was not prepared to start an argument.

"Yes, good-bye."

I rang off before she could say anything more. In heaven when the blessed use the telephone they will say what they have to say and not a word beside.

I was devoted to Janet, but I knew that there was nothing that thrilled her more than the misfortunes of her friends. She was only too anxious to help them, but she wanted to be in the thick of their difficulties. She was the friend in adversity. Other people's business was meat and drink to her. You could not enter upon a love affair without finding her somehow your confidante nor be mixed up in a divorce case without discovering that she too had a finger in the pie. Withal she was a very nice woman. I could not help then chuckling in my heart when at noon I was shown into Janet's drawing-room and observed the subdued eagerness with which she received me. She was very much upset by the catastrophe that had befallen the Bishops, but it was exciting, and she was tickled to death to have someone fresh whom she could tell all about it. Janet had just that business-like expectancy that a mother has when she is discussing with the family doctor her married daughter's first confinement. Janet was conscious that the matter was very serious, and she would not for a moment have been thought to regard it flippantly, but she was determined to get every ounce of value out of it.

"I mean, no one could have been more horrified than I was when Margery told me she'd finally made up her mind to leave Charlie," she said, speaking with the fluency of a person who has said the same thing in the same words a dozen times at least. "They were the most devoted couple I'd ever known. It was a perfect marriage. They got on like a house on fire. Of course Bill and I are devoted to one another, but we have awful rows now and then. I mean, I could kill him sometimes."

"I don't care a hang about your relations with Bill," I said. "Tell me about the Bishops. That's what I've come here for."

"I simply felt I must see you. After all you're the only person who can explain it."

"Oh, God, don't go on like that. Until Bill told me last night I didn't know a thing about it."

"That was my idea. It suddenly dawned on me that perhaps you didn't know and I thought you might put your foot in it too awfully."

"Supposing you began at the beginning," I said.

"Well, you're the beginning. After all you started the trouble. You introduced the young man. That's why I was so crazy to see you. You know all about him. I never saw him. All I know is what Margery has told me about him."

"At what time are you lunching?" I asked.

"Half past one."

"So am I. Get on with the story."

But my remark had given Janet an idea.

"Look here, will you get out of your luncheon if I get out of mine? We could have a snack here. I'm sure there's some cold meat in the house, and then we needn't hurry. I don't have to be at the hairdresser's till three."

"No, no, no," I said. "I hate the notion of that. I shall leave here at twenty minutes past one at the latest."

"Then I shall just have to race through it. What do you think of Gerry?"

"Who's Gerry?"

"Gerry Morton. His name's Gerald."

"How should I know that?"

"You stayed with him. Weren't there any letters lying about?"

"I daresay, but I didn't happen to read them," I answered somewhat tartly.

"Oh, don't be so stupid. I meant the envelopes. What's he like?"

"All right. Rather the Kipling type, you know. Very keen on his work. Hearty. Empire-builder and all that sort of thing."

"I don't mean that," cried Janet, not without impatience. "I mean, what does he look like?"

"More or less like everybody else, I think. Of course I should recognize him if I saw him again, but I can't picture him to myself very distinctly. He looks clean."

"Oh, my God," said Janet. "Are you a novelist or are you not? What's the colour of his eyes?"

"I don't know."

"You must know. You can't spend a week with anyone without knowing if their eyes are blue or brown. Is he fair or dark?"

"Neither."

"Is he tall or short?"

"Average, I should say."

"Are you trying to irritate me?"

"No. He's just ordinary. There's nothing in him to attract your attention. He's neither plain nor good-looking. He looks quite decent. He looks a gentleman."

"Margery says he has a charming smile and a lovely figure."

"I dare say."

"He's absolutely crazy about her."

"What makes you think that?" I asked dryly.

"I've seen his letters."

"Do you mean to say she's shown them to you?"

"Why, of course."

It is always difficult for a man to stomach the want of reticence that women betray in their private affairs. They have no shame. They will talk to one another without embarrassment of the most intimate matters. Modesty is a masculine virtue. But though a man may know this theoretically, each time he is confronted with women's lack of reserve he suffers a new shock. I wondered what Morton would think if he knew that not only were his letters read by Janet Marsh as well as by Margery, but that she had been kept posted from day to day with the progress of his infatuation. According to Janet he had fallen in love with Margery at first sight. The morning after they had met at my little supper party at Ciro's he had rung up and asked her to come and have tea with him at some place where they could dance. While I listened to Janet's story I was conscious of course that she was giving me Margery's view of the circumstances and I kept an open mind. I was interested to observe that Janet's sympathies were with Margery. It was true that when Margery left her husband it was her idea that Charlie should come to them for two or three weeks rather than stay on in miserable loneliness in the deserted flat and she had been extraordinarily kind to him. She lunched with him almost every day, because he had been accustomed to lunch every day with Margery; she took him for walks in Regent's Park and made Bill play golf with him on Sundays. She listened with wonderful patience to the story of his unhappiness and did what she could to console him. She was terribly sorry for him. But all the same she was definitely on Margery's side and when I expressed my disapproval of her she came down on me like a thousand of bricks. The affair thrilled her. She had been in it from the beginning when Margery, smiling, flattered, and a little doubtful, came and told her that she had a young man to the final scene when Margery, exasperated and distraught, announced that she could not stand the strain any more and had packed her things and moved out of the flat.

"Of course, at first I couldn't believe my ears," she said. "You know how Charlie and Margery were. They simply lived in one another's pockets. One couldn't help laughing at them, they were so devoted to one another. I never thought him a very nice little man and heaven knows he wasn't very attractive physically, but one couldn't help liking him because he was so awfully nice to Margery. I rather envied her sometimes. They had no money and they lived in a hugger-mugger sort of way, but they were frightfully happy. Of course I never thought anything would come of it. Margery was rather amused. 'Naturally I don't take it very seriously,' she told me, 'but it is rather fun to have a young man at my time of life. I haven't had any flowers sent me for years. I had to tell him not to send any more because Charlie would think it so silly. He doesn't know a soul in London and he loves dancing and he says I dance like a dream. It's miserable for him going to the theatre by himself all the time and we've done two or three matinees together. It's pathetic to see how grateful he is when I say I'll go out with him.' 'I must say,' I said, 'he sounds rather a lamb.' 'He is,' she said. 'I knew you'd understand. You don't blame me, do you?' 'Of course not, darling,' I said, 'surely you know me better than that. I'd do just the same in your place.'"

Margery made no secret of her outings with Morton and her husband chaffed her good-naturedly about her beau. But he thought him a very civil, pleasant-spoken young man and was glad that Margery had someone to play with while he was busy. It never occurred to him to be jealous. The three of them dined together several times and went to a show. But presently Gerry Morton begged Margery to spend an evening with him alone; she said it was impossible, but he was persuasive, he gave her no peace; and at last she went to Janet and asked her to ring up Charlie one day and ask him to come to dinner and make a fourth at bridge. Charlie would never go anywhere without his wife, but the Marshes were old friends, and Janet made a point of it. She invented some cock-and-bull story that made it seem important that he should consent. Next day Margery and she met. The evening had been wonderful. They had dined at Maidenhead and danced there and then had driven home through the summer night.

"He says he's crazy about me," Margery told her.

"Did he kiss you?" asked Janet.

"Of course," Margery chuckled. "Don't be silly, Janet. He is awfully sweet and, you know, he has such a nice nature. Of course I don't believe half the things he says to me."

"My dear, you're not going to fall in love with him."

"I have," said Margery.

"Darling, isn't it going to be rather awkward?"

"Oh, it won't last. After all he's going back to Borneo in the autumn."

"Well, one can't deny that it's made you look years younger."

"I know, and I feel years younger."

Soon they were meeting every day. They met in the morning and walked in the Park together or went to a picture gallery. They separated for Margery to lunch with her husband and after lunch met again and motored into the country or to some place on the river. Margery did not tell her husband. She very naturally thought he would not understand.

"How was it you never met Morton?" I asked Janet.

"Oh, she didn't want me to. You see, we belong to the same generation, Margery and I. I can quite understand that."

"I see."

"Of course I did everything I could. When she went out with Gerry she was always supposed to be with me."

I am a person who likes to cross a "t" and dot an "i".

"Were they having an affair?" I asked.

"Oh, no. Margery isn't that sort of woman at all."

"How do you know?"

"She would have told me."

"I suppose she would."

"Of course I asked her. But she denied it point-blank and I'm sure she was telling me the truth. There's never been anything of that sort between them at all."

"It seems rather odd to me."

"Well, you see, Margery is a very good woman."

I shrugged my shoulders.

"She was absolutely loyal to Charlie. She wouldn't have deceived him for anything in the world. She couldn't bear the thought of having any secret from him. As soon as she knew she was in love with Gerry she wanted to tell Charlie. Of course I begged her not to. I told her it wouldn't do any good and it would only make Charlie miserable. And after all, the boy was going away in a couple of months, it didn't seem much good to make a lot of fuss about a thing that couldn't possibly last."

But Gerry's imminent departure was the cause of the crash. The Bishops had arranged to go abroad as usual and proposed to motor through Belgium, Holland, and the North of Germany. Charlie was busy with maps and guides. He collected information from friends about hotels and roads. He looked forward to his holiday with the bubbling excitement of a schoolboy. Margery listened to him discussing it with a sinking heart. They were to be away four weeks and in September Gerry was sailing. She could not bear to lose so much of the short time that remained to them and the thought of the motor tour filled her with exasperation. As the interval grew shorter and shorter she grew more and more nervous. At last she decided that there was only one thing to do.

"Charlie, I don't want to come on this trip," she interrupted him suddenly, one day when he was talking to her of some restaurant he had just heard of. "I wish you'd get someone else to go with you."

He looked at her blankly. She was startled at what she had said and her lips trembled a little.

"Why, what's the matter?"

"Nothing's the matter. I don't feel like it. I want to be by myself for a bit."

"Are you ill?"

She saw the sudden fear in his eyes. His concern drove her beyond her endurance.

"No. I've never been better in my life. I'm in love."

"You? Whom with?"

"Gerry."

He looked at her in amazement. He could not believe his ears. She mistook his expression.

"It's no good blaming me. I can't help it. He's going away in a few weeks. I'm not going to waste the little time he has left." He burst out laughing.

"Margery, how can you make such a damned fool of yourself? You're old enough to be his mother." She flushed.

"He's just as much in love with me as I am with him."

"Has he told you so?"

"A thousand times."

"He's a bloody liar, that's all."

He chuckled. His fat stomach rippled with mirth. He thought it a huge joke. I daresay Charlie did not treat his wife in the proper way. Janet seemed to think he should have been tender and compassionate. He should have understood. I saw the scene that was in her mind's eye, the stiff upper lip, the silent sorrow, and the final renunciation. Women are always sensitive to the beauty of the self-sacrifice of others. Janet would have sympathized also if he had flown into a violent passion, broken one or two pieces of furniture (which he would have had to replace), or given Margery a sock in the jaw. But to laugh at her was unpardonable. I did not point out that it is very difficult for a rather stout and not very tall professor of pathology, aged fifty-five, to act all of a sudden like a cave-man. Anyhow, the excursion to Holland was given up and the Bishops stayed in London through August. They were not very happy. They lunched and dined together every day because they had been in the habit of doing so for so many years and the rest of the time Margery spent with Gerry. The hours she passed with him made up for all she had to put up with and she had to put up with a good deal. Charlie had a ribald and sarcastic humour and he made himself very funny at her expense and at Gerry's. He persisted in refusing to take the matter seriously. He was vexed with Margery for being so silly, but apparently it never occurred to him that she might have been unfaithful to him. I commented upon this to Janet.

"He never suspected it even," she said. "He knew Margery much too well."

The weeks passed and at last Gerry sailed. He went from Tilbury and Margery saw him off. When she came back she cried for forty-eight hours. Charlie watched her with increasing exasperation. His nerves were much frayed.

"Look here, Margery," he said at last, "I've been very patient with you, but now you must pull yourself together. This is getting past a joke."

"Why can't you leave me alone?" she cried. "I've lost everything that made life lovely to me."

"Don't be such a fool," he said.

I do not know what else he said. But he was unwise enough to tell her what he thought of Gerry and I gather that the picture he drew was virulent. It started the first violent scene they had ever had. She had borne Charlie's jibes when she knew that she would see Gerry in an hour or next day, but now that she had lost him for ever she could bear them no longer. She had held herself in for weeks: now she flung her self-control to the winds. Perhaps she never knew exactly what she said to Charlie. He had always been irascible and at last he hit her. They were both frightened when he had. He seized a hat and flung out of the flat. During all that miserable time they had shared the same bed, but when he came back, in the middle of the night, he found that she had made herself up a shake-down on the sofa in the sitting-room.

"You can't sleep there," he said. "Don't be so silly. Come to bed."

"No, I won't, let me alone."

For the rest of the night they wrangled, but she had her way and now made up her bed every night on the sofa. But in that tiny flat they could not get away from one another; they could not even get out of sight or out of hearing of one another. They had lived in such intimacy for so many years that it was an instinct for them to be together. He tried to reason with her. He thought her incredibly stupid and argued with her interminably in the effort to show her how wrong-headed she was. He could not leave her alone. He would not let her sleep, and he talked half through the night till they were both exhausted. He thought he could talk her out of love. For two or three days at a time they would not speak to one another. Then one day, coming home, he found her crying bitterly; the sight of her tears distracted him; he told her how much he loved her and sought to move her by the recollection of all the happy years they had spent together. He wanted to let bygones be bygones. He promised never to refer to Gerry again. Could they not forget the nightmare they had been through? But the thought of all that a reconciliation implied revolted her. She told him she had a racking headache and asked him to give her a sleeping draught. She pretended to be still asleep when he went out next morning, but the moment he was gone she packed up her things and left. She had a few trinkets that she had inherited and by selling them she got a little money. She took a room at a cheap boarding-house and kept her address a secret from Charlie.

It was when he found she had left him that he went all to pieces. The shock of her flight broke him. He told Janet that his loneliness was intolerable. He wrote to Margery imploring her to come back, and asked Janet to intercede for him; he was willing to promise anything; he abased himself. Margery was obdurate.

"Do you think she'll ever go back?" I asked Janet.

"She says not."

I had to leave then, for it was nearly half past one and I was bound for the other end of London.

Two or three days later I got a telephone message from Margery asking if I could see her. She suggested coming to my rooms. I asked her to tea. I tried to be nice to her; her affairs were no business of mine, but in my heart I thought her a very silly woman and I dare say my manner was cold. She had never been handsome and the passing years had changed her little. She had still those fine dark eyes and her face was astonishingly unlined. She was very simply dressed and if she wore make-up it was so cunningly put on that I did not perceive it. She had still the charm she had always had of perfect naturalness and of a kindly humour.

"I want you to do something for me if you will," she began without beating about the bush.

"What is it?"

"Charlie is leaving the Marshes today and going back to the flat. I'm afraid his first few days there will be rather difficult; it would be awfully nice of you if you'd ask him to dinner or something."

"I'll have a look at my book."

"I'm told he's been drinking heavily. It's such a pity. I wish you could give him a hint."

"I understand he's had some domestic worries of late," I said, perhaps acidly.

Margery flushed. She gave me a pained look. She winced as though I had struck her.

"Of course you've known him ever so much longer than you've known me. It's natural that you should take his part."

"My dear, to tell you the truth I've known him all these years chiefly on your account. I have never very much liked him, but I thought you were awfully nice."

She smiled at me and her smile was very sweet. She knew that I meant what I said.

"Do you think I was a good wife to him?"

"Perfect."

"He used to put people's backs up. A lot of people didn't like him, but I never found him difficult."

"He was awfully fond of you."

"I know. We had a wonderful time together. For sixteen years we were perfectly happy." She paused and looked down. "I had to leave him. It became quite impossible. That cat-and-dog life we were leading was too awful."

"I never see why two persons should go on living together if they don't want to."

"You see, it was awful for us. We'd always lived in such close intimacy. We could never get away from one another. At the end I hated the sight of him."

"I don't suppose the situation was easy for either of you."

"It wasn't my fault that I fell in love. You see, it was quite a different love from the one I'd felt for Charlie. There was always something maternal in that and protective. I was so much more reasonable than he was. He was unmanageable, but I could always manage him. Gerry was different." Her voice grew soft and her face was transfigured with glory. "He gave me back my youth. I was a girl to him and I could depend on his strength and be safe in his care."

"He seemed to me a very nice lad," I said slowly. "I imagine he'll do well. He was very young for the job he had when I ran across him. He's only twenty-nine now, isn't he?"

She smiled softly. She knew quite well what I meant.

"I never made any secret of my age to him. He says it doesn't matter."

I knew this was true. She was not the woman to have lied about her age. She had found a sort of fierce delight in telling him the truth about herself.

"How old are you?"

"Forty-four."

"What are you going to do now?"

"I've written to Gerry and told him I've left Charlie. As soon as I hear from him I'm going out to join him." I was staggered.

"You know, it's a very primitive little colony he's living in. I'm afraid you'll find your position rather awkward."

"He made me promise that if I found my life impossible after he left I'd go to him."

"Are you sure you're wise to attach so much importance to the things a young man says when he's in love?"

Again that really beautiful look of exaltation came into her face. "Yes, when the young man happens to be Gerry."

My heart sank. I was silent for a moment. Then I told her the story of the road Gerry Morton had built. I dramatized it, and I think I made it rather effective.

"What did you tell me that for?" she asked when I finished.

"I thought it rather a good story."

She shook her head and smiled.

"No, you wanted to show me that he was very young and enthusiastic, and so keen on his work that he hadn't much time to waste on other interests. I wouldn't interfere with his work. You don't know him as I do. He's incredibly romantic. He looks upon himself as a pioneer. I've caught from him something of his excitement at the idea of taking part in the opening up of a new country. It is rather splendid, isn't it? It makes life here seem very humdrum and commonplace. But of course it's very lonely there. Even the companionship of a middle-aged woman may be worth having."

"Are you proposing to marry him?" I asked.

"I leave myself in his hands. I want to do nothing that he does not wish."

She spoke with so much simplicity, there was something so touching in her self-surrender, that when she left me I no longer felt angry with her. Of course I thought her very foolish, but if the folly of men made one angry one would pass one's life in a state of chronic ire. I thought all would come right. She said Gerry was romantic. He was, but the romantics in this workaday world only get away with their nonsense because they have at bottom a shrewd sense of reality: the mugs are the people who take their vapourings at their face value. The English are romantic; that is why other nations think them hypocritical; they are not: they set out in all sincerity for the Kingdom of God, but the journey is arduous and they have reason to pick up any gilt-edged investment that offers itself by the way. The British soul, like Wellington's armies, marches on its belly. I supposed that Gerry would go through a bad quarter of an hour when he received Margery's letter. My sympathies were not deeply engaged in the matter and I was only curious to see how he would extricate himself from the pass he was in. I thought Margery would suffer a bitter disappointment; well, that would do her no great harm, and then she would go back to her husband and I had no doubt the pair of them, chastened, would live in peace, quiet, and happiness for the rest of their lives.

The event was different. It happened that it was quite impossible for me to make any sort of engagement with Charlie Bishop for some days, but I wrote to him and asked him to dine with me one evening in the following week. I proposed, though with misgiving, that we should go to a play; I knew he was drinking like a fish, and when tight he was noisy. I hoped he would not make a nuisance of himself in the theatre. We arranged to meet at our club and dine at seven because the piece we were going to began at a quarter past eight. I arrived. I waited. He did not come. I rang up his flat, but could get no reply, so concluded that he was on his way. I hate missing the beginning of a play and I waited impatiently in the hall so that when he came we could go straight upstairs. To save time I had ordered dinner. The clock pointed to half past seven, then a quarter to eight; I did not see why I should wait for him any longer, so walked up to the dining-room and ate my dinner alone. He did not appear. I put a call through from the dining-room to the Marshes and presently was told by a waiter that Bill Marsh was at the end of the wire.

"I say, do you know anything about Charlie Bishop?" I said. "We were dining together and going to a play and he hasn't turned up."

"He died this afternoon."

"What?"

My exclamation was so startled that two or three people within earshot looked up. The dining-room was full and the waiters were hurrying to and fro. The telephone was on the cashier's desk and a wine waiter came up with a bottle of hock and two long-stemmed glasses on a tray and gave the cashier a chit. The portly steward showing two men to a table jostled me.

"Where are you speaking from?" asked Bill.

I suppose he heard the clatter that surrounded me. When I told him he asked me if I could come round as soon as I had finished my dinner. Janet wanted to speak to me.

"I'll come at once," I said.

I found Janet and Bill sitting in the drawing-room. He was reading the paper and she was playing patience. She came forward swiftly when the maid showed me in. She walked with a sort of spring, crouching a little, on silent feet, like a panther stalking his prey. I saw at once that she was in her element. She gave me her hand and turned her face away to hide her eyes brimming with tears. Her voice was low and tragic.

"I brought Margery here and put her to bed. The doctor has given her a sedative. She's all in. Isn't it awful?" She gave a sound that was something between a gasp and a sob. "I don't know why these things always happen to me."

The Bishops had never kept a servant but a charwoman went in every morning, cleaned the flat, and washed up the breakfast things. She had her own key. That morning she had gone in as usual and done the sitting-room. Since his wife had left him Charlie's hours had been irregular and she was not surprised to find him asleep. But the time passed and she knew he had his work to go to. She went to the bedroom door and knocked. There was no answer. She thought she heard him groaning. She opened the door softly. He was lying in bed, on his back, and was breathing stertorously. He did not wake. She called him. Something about him frightened her. She went to the flat on the same landing. It was occupied by a journalist. He was still in bed when she rang, and opened the door to her in pyjamas.

"Beg pardon, sir," she said, "but would you just come and 'ave a look at my gentleman. I don't think he's well."

The journalist walked across the landing and into Charlie's flat. There was an empty bottle of veronal by the bed.

"I think you'd better fetch a policeman," he said.

A policeman came and rang through to the police station for an ambulance. They took Charlie to Charing Cross Hospital. He never recovered consciousness. Margery was with him at the end.

"Of course there'll have to be an inquest," said Janet. "But it's quite obvious what happened. He'd been sleeping awfully badly for the last three or four weeks and I suppose he'd been taking veronal. He must have taken an overdose by accident."

"Is that what Margery thinks?" I asked.

"She's too upset to think anything, but I told her I was positive he hadn't committed suicide. I mean, he wasn't that sort of a man. Am I right, Bill?"

"Yes, dear," he answered.

"Did he leave any letter?"

"No, nothing. Oddly enough Margery got a letter from him this morning, well, hardly a letter, just a line. 'I'm so lonely without you, darling.' That's all. But of course that means nothing and she's promised to say nothing about it at the inquest. I mean, what is the use of putting ideas in people's heads? Everyone knows that you never can tell with veronal, I wouldn't take it myself for anything in the world, and it was quite obviously an accident. Am I right, Bill?"

"Yes, dear," he answered.

I saw that Janet was quite determined to believe that Charlie Bishop had not committed suicide, but how far in her heart she believed what she wanted to believe I was not sufficiently expert in female psychology to know. And of course it might be that she was right. It is unreasonable to suppose that a middle-aged scientist should kill himself because his middle-aged wife leaves him and it is extremely plausible that, exasperated by sleeplessness, and in all probability far from sober, he took a larger dose of the sleeping-draught than he realized. Anyhow that was the view the coroner took of the matter. It was indicated to him that of late Charles Bishop had given way to habits of intemperance which had caused his wife to leave him, and it was quite obvious that nothing was further from his thoughts than to put an end to himself. The coroner expressed his sympathy with the widow and commented very strongly on the dangers of sleeping-draughts.

I hate funerals, but Janet begged me to go to Charlie's. Several of his colleagues at the hospital had intimated their desire to come, but at Margery's wish they were dissuaded; and Janet and Bill, Margery and I were the only persons who attended it. We were to fetch the hearse from the mortuary and they offered to call for me on their way. I was on the look-out for the car and when I saw it drive up went downstairs, but Bill got out and met me just inside the door.

"Half a minute," he said. "I've got something to say to you. Janet wants you to come back afterwards and have tea. She says it's no good Margery moping and after tea we'll play a few rubbers of bridge. Can you come?"

"Like this?" I asked.

I had a tail coat on and a black tie and my evening dress trousers.

"Oh, that's all right. It'll take Margery's mind off."

"Very well."

But we did not play bridge after all. Janet, with her fair hair, was very smart in her deep mourning and she played the part of the sympathetic friend with amazing skill. She cried a little, wiping her eyes delicately so as not to disturb the black on her eyelashes, and when Margery sobbed broken-heartedly put her arm tenderly through hers. She was a very present help in trouble. We returned to the house. There was a telegram for Margery. She took it and went upstairs. I presumed it was a message of condolence from one of Charlie's friends who had just heard of his death. Bill went to change and Janet and I went up to the drawing-room and got the bridge table out. She took off her hat and put it on the piano.

"It's no good being hypocritical." she said. "Of course Margery has been frightfully upset, but she must pull herself together now. A rubber of bridge will help her to get back to her normal state. Naturally I'm dreadfully sorry about poor Charlie, but as far as he was concerned I don't believe he'd ever have got over Margery's leaving him and one can't deny that it has made things much easier for her. She wired to Gerry this morning."

"What about?"

"To tell him about poor Charlie."

At that moment the maid came to the room.

"Will you go up to Mrs. Bishop, please, ma'am? She wants to see you."

"Yes, of course."

She went out of the room quickly and I was left alone. Bill joined me presently and we had a drink. At last Janet came back. She handed a telegram to me. It read as follows:





For God's sake await letter. Gerry





"What do you think it means?" she asked me. "What it says," I replied.

"Idiot! Of course I've told Margery that it doesn't mean anything, but she's rather worried. It must have crossed her cable telling him that Charles was dead. I don't think she feels very much like bridge after all. I mean, it would be rather bad form to play on the very day her husband has been buried."

"Quite," I said.

"Of course he may wire in answer to the cable. He's sure to do that, isn't he? The only thing we can do now is to sit tight and wait for his letter."

I saw no object in continuing the conversation. I left. In a couple of days Janet rang me up to tell me that Margery had received a telegram of condolence from Morton. She repeated it to me:





Dreadfully distressed to hear sad news. Deeply sympathize with your great grief.Love. Gerry





"What do you think of it?" she asked me.

"I think it's very proper."

"Of course he couldn't say he was as pleased as Punch, could he?"

"Not with any delicacy."

"And he did put in love."

I imagined how those women had examined the two telegrams from every point of view and scrutinized every word to press from it every possible shade of meaning. I almost heard their interminable conversations.

"I don't know what'll happen to Margery if he lets her down now," Janet went on. "Of course it remains to be seen if he's a gentleman."

"Rot," I said and rang off quickly.

In the course of the following days I dined with the Marshes a couple of times. Margery looked tired. I guessed that she awaited the letter that was on the way with sickening anxiety. Grief and fear had worn her to a shadow, she seemed very fragile now and she had acquired a spiritual look that I had never seen in her before. She was very gentle, very grateful for every kindness shown her, and in her smile, unsure and a little timid, was an infinite pathos. Her helplessness was very appealing. But Morton was several thousand miles away. Then one morning Janet rang me up.

"The letter has come. Margery says I can show it to you. Will you come round?"

Her tense voice told me everything. When I arrived Janet gave it to me. I read it. It was a very careful letter and I guessed that Morton had written it a good many times. It was very kind and he had evidently taken great pains to avoid saying anything that could possibly wound Margery; but what transpired was his terror. It was obvious that he was shaking in his shoes. He had felt apparently that the best way to cope with the situation was to be mildly facetious and he made very good fun of the white people in the colony. What would they say if Margery suddenly turned up? He would be given the order of the boot pretty damn quick. People thought the East was free and easy; it wasn't, it was more suburban than Clapham. He loved Margery far too much to bear the thoughts of those horrible women out there turning up their noses at her. And besides he had been sent to a station ten days from anywhere; she couldn't live in his bungalow exactly and of course there wasn't a hotel, and his work took him out into the jungle for days at a time. It was no place for a woman anyhow. He told her how much she meant to him, but she mustn't bother about him and he couldn't help thinking it would be better if she went back to her husband. He would never forgive himself if he thought he had come between her and Charlie. Yes, I am quite sure it had been a difficult letter to write.

"Of course he didn't know then that Charlie was dead. I've told Margery that changes everything."

"Does she agree with you?"

"I think she's being rather unreasonable. What do you make of the letter?"

"Well, it's quite plain that he doesn't want her."

"He wanted her badly enough two months ago."

"It's astonishing what a change of air and a change of scene will do for you. It must seem to him already like a year since he left London. He's back among his old friends and his old interests. My dear, it's no good Margery kidding herself; the life there has taken him back and there's no place for her."

"I've advised her to ignore the letter and go straight out to him."

"I hope she's too sensible to expose herself to a very terrible rebuff."

"But then what's to happen to her? Oh, it's too cruel. She's the best woman in the world. She has real goodness."

"It's funny if you come to think of it, it's her goodness that has caused all the trouble. Why on earth didn't she have an affair with Morton? Charlie would have known nothing about it and wouldn't have been a penny the worse. She and Morton could have had a grand time and when he went away they could have parted with the consciousness that a pleasant episode had come to a graceful end. It would have been a jolly recollection, and she could have gone back to Charlie satisfied and rested and continued to make him the excellent wife she had always been."

Janet pursed her lips. She gave me a look of disdain.

"There is such a thing as virtue, you know."

"Virtue be damned. A virtue that only causes havoc and unhappiness is worth nothing. You can call it virtue if you like. I call it cowardice."

"The thought of being unfaithful to Charlie while she was living with him revolted her. There are women like that, you know."

"Good gracious, she could have remained faithful to him in spirit while she was being unfaithful to him in the flesh. That is a feat of legerdemain that women find it easy to accomplish."

"What an odious cynic you are."

"If it's cynical to look truth in the face and exercise common sense in the affairs of life, then certainly I'm a cynic and odious if you like. Let's face it, Margery's a middle-aged woman, Charlie was fifty-five and they'd been married for sixteen years. It was natural enough that she should lose her head over a young man who made a fuss of her. But don't call it love. It was physiology. She was a fool to take anything he said seriously. It wasn't himself speaking, it was his starved sex, he'd suffered from sexual starvation, at least as far as white women are concerned, for four years; it's monstrous that she should seek to ruin his life by holding him to the wild promises he made then. It was an accident that Margery took his fancy; he wanted her, and because he couldn't get her wanted her more. I dare say he thought it love; believe me, it was only letch. If they'd gone to bed together Charlie would be alive today. It's her damned virtue that caused the whole trouble."

"How stupid you are. Don't you see that she couldn't help herself? She just doesn't happen to be a loose woman."

"I prefer a loose woman to a selfish one and a wanton to a fool."

"Oh, shut up. I didn't ask you to come here in order to make yourself absolutely beastly."

"What did you ask me to come here for?"

"Gerry is your friend. You introduced him to Margery. If she's in the soup it's on his account. But you are the cause of the whole trouble. It's your duty to write to him and tell him he must do the right thing by her."

"I'm damned if I will," I said.

"Then you'd better go."

I started to do so.

"Well, at all events it's a mercy that Charlie's life was insured," said Janet.

Then I turned on her.

"And you have the nerve to call me a cynic"

I will not repeat the opprobious word I flung at her as I slammed the door behind me. But Janet is all the same a very nice woman. I often think it would be great fun to be married to her.
