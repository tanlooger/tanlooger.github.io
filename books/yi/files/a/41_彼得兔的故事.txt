小兔彼得的故事


从前，有四只小兔子，他们的名字分别是：噗噗、篷篷、棉花尾巴和彼得。他们和母亲一起住在一个沙坝上一棵非常大的枞树根底下。

一天清晨，兔子太太说：“听我说，宝贝儿们，你们可以去田野里或是小路上玩，不过，不要到麦克格雷格先生的菜园里去。你们的父亲就是在那里出的事，他被麦克格雷格太太做成了馅饼。现在去玩吧！不要调皮捣蛋。我要出门了。”

然后，兔子太太就拎着一个篮子，带着她的伞，去了森林里的面包店。她买了一条黑面包和五个加了葡萄干的小圆面包。

噗噗、篷篷和棉花尾巴都是乖乖的小兔子，一起到小路上摘黑莓去了，而彼得却是个淘气的家伙，直接跑到麦克格雷格先生家的菜园里去了。然后，他从门下面的缝隙中挤了进去！

他先吃了一些生菜，又吃了一些菜豆，后来又吃了一些小萝卜。然后，他觉得有些不舒服，便去找芹菜吃。但是，刚绕过一片黄瓜架，他就和麦克格雷格先生碰了个面对面！

麦克格雷格先生当时正趴在地上移栽卷心菜的秧苗，他一跃而起，就来追彼得。他手里挥舞着一个耙子，喊道：“站住，小偷！”

彼得简直害怕得要命，他在菜园中慌张地乱窜，因为他已经忘记通往大门的路了。他在卷心菜地中丢了一只鞋，然后在马铃薯菜地中掉了另一只鞋。鞋子丢了之后，他四脚着地，可以跑得更快了。我猜按照那速度，他本可以逃脱的，可他不走运，一头撞进了醋栗树丛交织成的网里，他外套上的大纽扣都被醋栗网给挂住了。彼得穿的是一件有黄铜纽扣的蓝色外套，非常新呢。

彼得认为自己无处可逃，一定会被抓住的，眼泪便大颗大颗地滚了下来。他的抽泣声被几只好心的麻雀听到了，他们焦急地飞过来，鼓励他不要放弃。

麦克格雷格先生拿着一个筛子走了过来，他想用筛子扣住彼得，但好在彼得及时地从网中挣脱了，只把外套甩在了那里。他迅速跑进工具棚，跳进了一个水壶中。那真是一个绝妙的藏身之处——只是里面装了很多水。

麦克格雷格先生十分确信彼得就躲在工具棚里，他觉得彼得可能就藏在了某个花盆的下面。所以，他把花盆一个个地翻过来，仔细地检查。

就在这时，彼得打了个喷嚏：“阿嚏！”麦克格雷格先生立刻就向他冲去，抬脚想踩彼得，而彼得从一扇窗户跳了出去，这一跳带翻了三个花盆。那窗户很小，麦克格雷格先生过不去，而且，他追彼得追得已经有些累了，所以他便回去继续干活了。

彼得坐下来歇了一会儿，他已经快喘不过气来了，因为害怕，浑身都在发抖，他根本不知道该怎么出去。而且，因为刚才藏在水壶里，他现在浑身都湿漉漉的。过了一会儿，他开始在菜园中漫无目的地走动，一跳一跳地，速度并不快，一边跳一边四处查看。他在墙上发现了一扇门，不过门却是锁着的，下面的缝隙太小了，根本没有办法让一只胖乎乎的小兔子挤过去。

有一只年迈的老鼠在石头台阶上跑来跑去，把豌豆和菜豆运到森林的家中。彼得向她打听大门的方向，但是老鼠的嘴里塞着一颗大豌豆，没有办法说话。她只是朝彼得摇了摇头。彼得又哭了起来。

然后，他想直接穿过菜园，但越走越迷糊。不一会儿，他走到了一个池塘边，麦克格雷格先生就是在这里给水壶灌水的。此刻，有一只白猫正在池塘边，盯着池塘里的金鱼，她非常非常安静地坐着，一动也不动，只是她的尾巴尖儿时不时地会抖一下，仿佛那尾巴尖儿是活的一样。彼得觉得最好直接走开不要打扰她，他曾经听自己的表哥——小兔本杰明——说过关于猫的事情。

他又回头向工具棚走，突然，在离他很近的地方传来了一阵锄头锄地的声音：嚓嚓，咔咔，咔咔，嚓嚓。彼得赶紧钻到灌木丛下面躲了起来。又过了一会儿，什么事情也没有发生，他又出来了，爬上一辆独轮手推车，偷偷地打量四周。第一眼，他就看到了麦克格雷格先生正在洋葱地里面锄地。他背对着彼得，而越过他便是大门。

彼得悄悄地从独轮车上下来，用自己最快的速度顺着黑醋栗丛后面的一条直直的小路拼命地跑。

他拐弯的时候被麦克格雷格先生看到了，但彼得已经顾不得了。他直接从大门下面的缝隙钻了出去，终于离开了菜园，安全地到了树林里。

麦克格雷格先生把彼得的小外套和鞋子挂在一根杆子上，当作稻草人，来吓唬乌鸫。

彼得头也不回地一路跑回到大枞树下的家里。他累坏了，直接扑倒在兔子洞中柔软舒服的沙土地上，闭上了眼睛。兔子妈妈正在忙着做饭，她很好奇彼得的外套和鞋丢到哪里去了。要知道，这是半个月内彼得弄丢的第二件外套和第二双鞋了！

那天晚上，彼得不是很舒服。

妈妈把彼得放进床里，然后泡了一些甘菊茶给他喝。

“睡前喝一勺。”妈妈说。

不过，那天晚上，噗噗、篷篷和棉花尾巴的晚餐可是面包、牛奶和黑莓呢。





松鼠坚果金的故事


这是一个关于一条尾巴的故事——这条尾巴属于一只红色的小松鼠，他的名字叫作坚果金。他有一个兄弟，名字叫闪闪莓，另外他还有许多堂兄弟和表兄弟。他们都住在湖边的一个树林里。

在湖的中央，有一个小岛，岛上长满了树和结坚果的灌木，在那些树中，有一棵空心的橡树，那是一只名叫老灰灰的猫头鹰的家。

有一年秋天，坚果都成熟了，榛树的叶子有的金灿灿的，有的绿油油的——坚果金和闪闪莓以及其他所有小松鼠都走出树林，来到湖边。

他们用小树枝做成木筏子，划向猫头鹰岛去采坚果。每只小松鼠都带了一个小口袋，手握一根大桨，将尾巴撑起并展开作为船帆。他们还带了三只肥肥的老鼠，作为送给老灰灰的礼物，他们将老鼠放在了老灰灰家门前的台阶上。

闪闪莓和其他的小松鼠都深深地鞠躬，很有礼貌地说：

“灰灰老先生，您能慷慨地允许我们在您的岛上采坚果吗？”

但是坚果金却格外鲁莽无礼。他上蹿下跳，像颗小红樱桃一样，同时还唱着：





猜谜啦，猜谜啦，啰哒哟！

一个小小人，穿着红红袄！

手里拿权杖，喉咙卡石头；

要是你猜到，给你四便士。





这个谜语像山一样古老，而灰先生却根本没有理会坚果金。他只是自顾自地闭着眼睛，睡他的觉。

松鼠们在他们的小口袋里面装满了坚果，傍晚时划着筏子回家了。

第二天一早，他们又都来到了猫头鹰岛，闪闪莓和其他松鼠带来了一只肥美的鼹鼠，将它放在老灰灰家门口的石头上，说：

“灰先生，您能好心允许我们再采些坚果吗？”

但是坚果金没有表现出一点儿敬意，他开始手舞足蹈，上下乱跳，他手里握着一根荨麻逗弄灰灰老先生，同时唱道：





灰老先生啊！来猜谜呀！

墙里长着尖尖刺，

墙外长着尖尖刺，

要是你敢碰碰刺，

尖尖刺儿咬死你！





灰先生突然间醒了过来，将鼹鼠带到了自己的房子里。他当着坚果金的面关上了门，很快，柴火点燃了，从树顶上冒出了一缕青烟。坚果金透过钥匙孔向内窥探，他又唱道：





屋也满，洞也满！

你却收不齐一碗！





松鼠们在整个岛上四处寻找坚果，填满他们的小口袋。而坚果金却收集了一些橡果——有黄色的，也有深红色的——他坐在一个山毛榉树的树桩上，将橡果当作弹珠玩，一边玩一边盯着灰灰老先生的家门口。

第三天，松鼠们很早就起床了，然后就去钓鱼，他们钓到了七条肥硕硕的米诺鱼，作为送给老灰灰的礼物。他们划着筏子过湖，在一棵长得弯曲的栗子树下登上猫头鹰岛。

闪闪莓和另外六只小松鼠各拿着一只肥肥的米诺鱼。而坚果金则表现得更没有礼貌了，根本没有带礼物。他却跑在最前面，边跑边唱：





荒野里的那人来问我：

“海里长了多少草莓果？”

我细细想过才开口说：

“和林里红鲱鱼一样多。”





但是老灰灰先生对谜语不感兴趣，即便把答案告诉他，他也不感兴趣。

第四天，松鼠们给老灰灰带了六只肥肥的甲虫作为礼物，这对老灰灰来说，就像是李子布丁里面的李子一样好。每只甲虫都被包在一片阔叶草的草叶中，还用松针封了口。

而坚果金像以往一样粗野地唱着：





老灰先生！来跟我猜个谜！

英格兰的面粉，西班牙的水果，

在一场小雨中相遇成了一国；

把它们装进口袋里，再系上绳子，

你要是能告诉我谜底，我就给你一枚戒指。





坚果金这么说实在很可笑，因为他根本没有什么戒指可以送给老灰灰。

其他的松鼠在坚果灌木中钻来钻去地采坚果，但是坚果金却从石楠丛中找到了知更鸟的插针垫，在上面插满了松针。

第五天，松鼠们带了野蜂蜜作为礼物，那蜜又甜又黏，他们把蜜放下之后，都舔起了自己的手指。这蜜是他们从山顶上一个大黄蜂的蜂巢中偷来的。

而坚果金上蹿下跳地唱着：





哼哼嘣！嗡嗡嗡！哼嘣嗡！

我翻过那三叉山，

遇到一群美丽的猪；

有的黄脖子，有的黄脊背，

他们是三叉山上面

最最美丽的小猪！





面对坚果金的粗鲁无礼，老灰灰嫌弃地转过脸不看他。不过他倒是把蜜吃光了。

松鼠们把他们的小口袋里装满了坚果。

而坚果金却坐在一块大而平的石头上，用一颗沙果和一些青青的枞树球果玩起了保龄球游戏。

第六天是一个星期六，松鼠们最后一次来到猫头鹰岛，他们用一个灯芯草笼子装了一颗新下的鸡蛋，作为送给老灰灰的最后的告别礼物。

但是坚果金跑在最前面，一边大笑，一边大叫：





矮胖子躺在河中央，

脖子上缠着白床罩，

四十个医生和四十个工匠，

也没法子把矮胖子扶起来！





老灰灰对鸡蛋很感兴趣，他睁开了一只眼睛，然后又闭上了。但他一直没有说话。

坚果金却越来越粗鲁：





老灰先生！老灰先生！

马笼头，马缰绳，

挂在国王厨房门上；

国王全部的马，

国王全部的人，

也没法子把马笼头和马缰绳，

从国王厨房的门上取走！





坚果金像一束阳光一样跳来跳去，但老灰灰还是什么都没有说。

坚果金又开始唱道：





波尔的亚瑟挣断了链，

一路咆哮着上了岸！

苏格兰国王用尽了力，

也没法把亚瑟赶回去！





坚果金发出呼呼的叫声，好像风声一样，他助跑了一段，然后一跃而起，跳上了老灰灰的头。立刻，传来一阵翅膀的扑打声，接着便是一场厮打，还传来了一声很大声的“吱”！

其他松鼠全都四散奔逃，躲进了灌木丛中。等他们蹑手蹑脚地回来时，从大树后面偷看，只看到老灰灰坐在自家门前的台阶上，眼睛闭着，仿佛什么事都没有发生过，而坚果金此时却在老灰灰的马甲口袋里。





这似乎就是故事的结局了，不过还不是。

老灰灰把坚果金带到了自己的屋子里，提住他的尾巴，要把他的皮剥下来。但坚果金奋力挣扎，以致挣断了尾巴，他猛地冲上楼梯，从阁楼的窗子跳出去逃跑了。

直到今天，你要是在树上看到坚果金，请他猜个谜语，他准会向你扔树枝，并跺着脚大喊：

咯——咯——咯——咔——啦——啦——咯——咔——咔！





格洛斯特的裁缝


很久以前，有一段时期，人们都佩带宝剑，头戴假发，穿着有印花垂饰的连身外套。那时候的绅士们都穿着带褶皱花边的衣服，或用棱纹丝和塔夫绸做成的镶金色花边的马甲。就在那时，在格洛斯特住着一个裁缝。

他的店铺在西门街上，他每天都坐在店铺窗户前，双腿盘坐在工作台上，从早到晚地缝制衣服。

只要白日的光线充足，他就不停地又裁又缝，拼接缎子、花纹布、亮光绸。那些布料都有着奇怪的名字，在格洛斯特裁缝生活的时代，它们都是很昂贵的。

尽管裁缝为他的邻居们缝制上等丝绸的衣服，但是他自己却非常非常穷——他是一个戴着眼镜的小老头儿，脸上满是皱纹，双手苍老得变了形，身上总穿着已经磨破了边的旧衣服。

他裁剪衣服的时候从来都不浪费，总是将绣花布料物尽其用。在他的桌子上放着很多小布头和小碎片。“实在太零碎了，什么也做不了——只能给老鼠们做马甲了。”裁缝说。

在临近圣诞节的一个寒冷冬日，裁缝开始为格洛斯特的市长做一件外套。这件外套要用樱桃红色的灯芯绸制成，绣很多紫罗兰和玫瑰花，另外还要配上一件奶白色的缎子马甲，马甲要镶上薄纱和绿色精纺纱的花边。

裁缝不停地忙碌着，还不断地自言自语。他量完了绸缎的尺寸，然后又将绸缎翻过来又翻过去，用他的大剪刀将布料裁成需要的形状，桌子上留下了很多樱桃红色的布头。

“根本不够宽啊，只能斜着裁开，根本不够宽，只能给老鼠做披肩了！给那些小坏家伙做缎带喽！给老鼠！”格洛斯特的裁缝说。

雪花飘落，落在小小的铅制窗框上，光线越来越弱，裁缝结束了一天的工作，所有裁好的丝绸和缎子都摊放在桌子上。

桌上有做外套用的十二片布料和做马甲用的四片布料，另外还有口袋布、袖口和纽扣，全都放得井然有序。外套的衬里用的是上好的黄色塔夫绸，而马甲的扣眼则需要用樱桃红的丝线锁边。所有的东西都准备就绪，明天一早便能够将它们缝在一起，该量的都量好了，要用的也都充足——不过，里面还缺少一团用来锁边的樱桃红色的捻丝线。

天黑下来后，裁缝离开了他的店铺，他晚上不睡在这里。他关好了窗户，锁好门，装好钥匙走了。夜里，这里什么人都没有，只有一群棕色的小老鼠，他们进出根本不需要什么钥匙！

在格洛斯特，所有老房子的木头护墙板后面，都有小老鼠们的楼梯和秘密活板门，老鼠们通过窄窄的通道从一座房子到另一座房子，他们不用走街道就可以跑遍全镇。

裁缝离开店铺，冒着雪艰难地回到了自己的家。他住的地方离学院巷很近，就在学院草地门口的旁边。尽管那并不是一所多大的房子，但是裁缝太穷了，他也只租得起那里的厨房。

他和他的猫住在那里，他的猫叫辛普金。由于白天裁缝都在店铺工作，所以白天的时候辛普金独自在家，他也很喜欢老鼠，只是他从来不给他们做缎子外套！

“喵？”裁缝打开门的时候猫叫道，“喵？”

裁缝回答说：“辛普金，我们要发财了，不过我现在可真是要累散架了。拿着这枚四便士的硬币，这可是我们最后的四便士了，带上一个小瓷罐，去买一便士的面包、一便士的牛奶和一便士的香肠。噢，辛普金，用我们四便士中的最后一便士，给我买一卷樱桃红色的捻丝线。千万不要把最后一便士弄丢了呀，辛普金，不然我就真要完蛋了，那样我就没有丝线锁边了。”

然后辛普金又“喵”了一声，便带着钱和小罐子，走进了黑暗之中。

裁缝累极了，累得都要生病了。他坐在炉火旁边，自言自语地说着那件精美绝伦的外套。

“我会发财的——这儿要斜着裁——格洛斯特的市长会在圣诞节当天的上午结婚，他定做了一件外套和一件绣花的马甲——要用黄色塔夫绸做衬里——塔夫绸是足够用了，可剩下来的布头只够给老鼠做些披肩——”

就在这时，裁缝猛地一惊，因为突然间，从厨房另一头的橱柜里传来了一阵簌簌的响声，打断了他的思绪，那声音听起来是这样子的：

“踢嗒！”“踢嗒！”“踢嗒踢！”

“那是什么声音？”格洛斯特的裁缝说着从椅子上跳了起来，橱柜上摆满了各种罐子、柳叶花纹的盘子、茶杯和大杯子。

裁缝穿过厨房，然后一动不动地站在橱柜旁边，透过眼镜仔细观察着。从一个茶杯下面又传来了细细的声音：

“踢嗒！”“踢嗒！”“踢嗒踢！”

“这可真古怪。”格洛斯特的裁缝说着，就将倒扣着的茶杯拿了起来。从里面走出了一个小小的老鼠女士，她向裁缝行了个屈膝礼，然后便跳下橱柜，跑进了护墙板下面。

裁缝又坐回到火边，烤着自己冰冷的双手，又自顾自地嘀咕起来：

“马甲要用桃红色缎子裁出来——用漂亮、华丽的丝线绣出玫瑰花蕾！我把最后的四便士给了辛普金真的明智吗？可还有二十一个扣眼需要樱桃红色的丝线锁边啊！”

而就在这时，从橱柜里又传来了一阵小小的响动：

“踢嗒！”“踢嗒！”“踢嗒踢！”

“这可是太不同寻常了！”格洛斯特的裁缝说着，便将另一个倒扣着的茶杯翻了过来。这次走出来一只老鼠先生，他对着裁缝鞠了一躬。

然后，从整个橱柜中传来了一阵“踢嗒踢嗒”的合唱，声音全都一起响起，彼此相互应和，就好像一扇被蛀空的旧百叶窗中的蠹虫一般合唱着——

“踢嗒！”“踢嗒！”“踢嗒踢！”

从茶杯下面，从碗下面，从盆子下面，走出越来越多的小老鼠，他们都跳下橱柜，跑进护墙板的下面去了。

裁缝坐回炉火边，靠近炉火，叹息着：“有二十一个扣眼需要樱桃红色的丝线锁边啊！要在星期六的中午前完成，而现在已经是星期二晚上了。到底该不该把那些老鼠放走呢？他们肯定都是被辛普金抓起来的。唉唉，我要完了，我没有丝线锁边了。”

小老鼠们又出来了，听着裁缝的话，他们回忆着那件外套的式样，低声讨论着塔夫绸的衬里和小小的老鼠披肩。

然后，在一瞬间，他们全都跑到了护墙板后的通道中，吱吱叫着，呼唤着伙伴，从一座房子跑到另一座房子。等到辛普金提着一罐子牛奶回来的时候，裁缝的厨房中已经一只老鼠都没有了。

辛普金打开门，一跃而入，恼怒地叫了一声：“呼——呼——喵！”猫在恼怒的时候就会这么叫。辛普金很讨厌下雪，他的耳朵里和脖子后面的衣领下都钻进雪了。他把面包和香肠放到了橱柜上，用力吸着鼻子，使劲嗅着。

“辛普金，”裁缝说，“我的丝线呢？”

而辛普金只是把牛奶罐放在橱柜上，狐疑地看着茶杯。他还想着要把肥肥的小老鼠做晚餐呢！

“辛普金，”裁缝说，“我的丝线呢？”

但是辛普金把一个小包偷偷地藏到了茶壶里，然后冲着裁缝又吐口水又咆哮，如果辛普金可以说话的话，那他肯定是在问：“我的老鼠呢？”

“唉唉，我真完蛋了。”格洛斯特的裁缝说着，悲伤地爬到了床上。

一整夜，辛普金都在厨房里四处寻觅、搜索，检查橱柜，寻找护墙板下面，还探入他藏锁边丝线的茶壶中寻找，但是一只老鼠都没有找到！

裁缝只要在睡梦中嘟囔低语，辛普金便会发出“喵——呜——噢——”的声音，制造出奇怪而恐怖的噪音，猫在夜里总是会这么做。

可怜的老裁缝发起了高烧，躺在他的四柱床上辗转反侧，在睡梦中还嘟囔着：“没有丝线了！没有丝线了！”

他病了一整天，第二天也没有起来，第三天也是。那件樱桃红色的外套到底会怎么样呢？在西门街上的裁缝店里，裁好的绣花丝绸和缎子就摆在桌上，上面还有二十一个扣眼，可是店铺的窗户紧闭，门也被牢牢锁住，有谁能来缝起它们呢？但是这可拦不住棕色的小老鼠们，他们不需要任何钥匙，便能够在格洛斯特所有的老房子中进进出出，行走无碍。

在街上，赶集的人们为了烘焙他们的圣诞馅饼，顶风冒雪地去买鹅和火鸡，但是辛普金和可怜的老裁缝却没有圣诞大餐。

裁缝病着在床上躺了三天三夜，然后便到了圣诞节前夜。夜越来越深了，月亮爬过屋顶，爬上烟囱，俯视着通向学院巷的巷道。窗户里面没有灯，房子里面也都没有声音，整个格洛斯特市都在白雪的覆盖下陷入了沉睡之中。而辛普金依然想要他的老鼠，他站在四柱床旁边喵喵地叫着。

据古老的故事说，在圣诞节前夜到圣诞节早晨之间的深夜中，所有的动物都能讲话，只是很少有人能听到，或是明白那些动物说的什么。

当大教堂的钟声敲响了十二点的时候，答案揭晓了，就如同是钟声的回声一般。辛普金听到了那个声音，他走出裁缝家的门，在雪中徘徊。

从格洛斯特城所有的屋顶、山墙和老旧的木头屋子传来了一千个愉快的声音，唱着古老的圣诞歌曲——包括所有我曾经听过的老歌，还有一些我不知道的歌曲，就像是“惠廷顿的钟声”。

最初发声的，也是声音最响亮的，是公鸡们的歌声：“夫人，起床了，需要烤馅饼了！”

“噢，真好，真好，真好，真好！”辛普金叹息着。

一个阁楼上亮着灯光，并传来了跳舞的声音，猫们从那个方向过来。

“嘿呀，扭吧，扭吧，有猫还有小提琴！格洛斯特所有的猫都参加了——除了我。”辛普金说。

在木屋檐下面，八哥和麻雀唱着圣诞馅饼之歌；大教堂塔楼中的寒鸦醒了过来；尽管已经是午夜时分了，画眉鸟和知更鸟都在唱歌；空气中充满了微微呢喃的旋律。

但是这一切令可怜而饥饿的辛普金更加恼怒。

特别是一个木头隔板后面传来的微弱的尖细叫声令他格外烦躁。我觉得那后面的是蝙蝠，因为他们的嗓音总是非常微小，尤其是在严寒的黑暗中，他们就像格洛斯特的裁缝一样，会在睡梦中说话。他们说着一些神秘的事情，就像这样的东西：





蓝蝇嗡嗡嗡，

蜜蜂哼哼哼，

他们嗡又哼，

我们也一样！





辛普金走开了，他晃了晃耳朵，就像是有一只蜜蜂飞进了无边帽里。

从西门街上的裁缝店里透出一丝光亮。辛普金蹑足悄悄靠过去，透过窗户向里面窥望，窗户内点满了蜡烛。里面传来剪刀的咔嚓声、丝线的窸窣声，以及小老鼠们大声而欢快的歌声：





二十四个裁缝呀，

齐去抓蜗牛，

最厉害的那个呀，

怕碰蜗牛尾；

蜗牛伸出触角，

就像长角小母牛，

快跑啊，裁缝们，快点跑！

不然她会把你们都吃掉！





没有停顿，小老鼠们又接着唱道：





筛了太太的燕麦，

磨了太太的面粉，

放入栗子壳中，

等上一个小时。





“喵！喵！”辛普金打断了他们，他用爪子挠着门。但是钥匙放在裁缝的枕头下面，他没有办法进去。

小老鼠们一阵大笑，然后又唱起了另一首歌：





三只小老鼠，坐下来纺纱。

小猫经过了，偷偷看过来。

你们在干吗，我的好伙计？

我们做衣服，给绅士们穿。

让我进去吧，帮你们咬线头儿？

哦，不用了，猫小姐，你会咬断我们的头！





“喵！喵！”辛普金叫道，“嘿嘿摇一摇？”小老鼠们回应道：





嘿嘿摇一摇，乖乖小宠物！

伦敦的商人穿红衣，

领子用丝绸，镶边是金子，

商人们走路喜洋洋！





小老鼠们敲着顶针打节拍，不过这些歌辛普金都不喜欢，他在店铺的门口嗅来嗅去，喵喵叫着。





然后我买了，

一个瓦罐和一个水罐，

一个纸罐和一个废水罐，

总共只花了一个子儿——





“就放在厨房的橱柜上。”粗鲁的小老鼠们又加了一句。

“喵！嚓！嚓！”辛普金挠着窗台，屋内的小老鼠们都站了起来，一齐用低低的呢喃声喊道：“没有丝线了！没有丝线了！”他们关上了百叶窗，把辛普金彻底关在了外面。

但是通过百叶窗的缝隙，他依然能够听到屋内顶针的碰击声，还有小老鼠们的歌声：





“没有丝线了！没有丝线了！”





辛普金离开店铺，回了家，一路上都在沉思。回到家后他发现可怜的老裁缝已经退烧了，正安详地睡着。然后，辛普金踮着脚走到橱柜边，从茶壶中拿出了那一小卷丝线，借着月光看着它。想到那些善良的小老鼠，他为自己做过的坏事感到很愧疚。

第二天一早，裁缝醒了过来，他看到的第一样东西，就在他那碎布缝成的被子上面，是一卷樱桃红色的捻丝线，而忏悔的辛普金就站在他的床边。

“哎呀，我真是累坏了呀，”格洛斯特的裁缝说，“不过我有了丝线呀！”

裁缝起床穿好衣服，走到街上，辛普金跑在他前面。这时候阳光灿烂，照耀着雪地。

八哥们在烟囱上面吹着口哨，画眉鸟和知更鸟在唱着歌，不过他们用的是他们特有的语言，不再像夜里那样唱出歌词了。

“哎呀，”裁缝说，“我有了锁边线了，可是我没有力气呀，也没有时间，顶多能够锁好一个扣眼，现在已经是圣诞节当天早晨了！格洛斯特的市长中午就要举行婚礼了——可他的樱桃红外套在哪里呢？”

他打开了西门街上的小店铺的门，辛普金跑了进去，就像是在期待着什么。但是里面没有一个人！甚至连一只棕色的小老鼠都没有。

工作台都被打扫清理过了，线头和丝绸的碎片全都被清走了，地面上也没有什么东西。不过就在桌子上面——噢，真让人惊喜！裁缝发出一声惊呼——就在那里，在他放着裁剪好的丝绸的地方——现在那里放着一件最美丽的外套和一件绣花的缎子马甲，格洛斯特的任何一任市长都没有穿过这么精致、美丽的衣服。在外套的前襟上有玫瑰和紫罗兰的绣花，而马甲上面则绣着罂粟花和矢车菊。除了还有一个扣眼需要锁上樱桃红色的丝线锁边以外，其他的一切工作都完成了。那个扣眼上别着一张小纸片，上面用极小极细的字写着：





没有丝线了。





从此以后，格洛斯特的裁缝的好运来了，他变得身体强壮，又非常富有。他做最好的马甲，为格洛斯特所有有钱的商人和全国各地所有体面的绅士服务。

从来都没有人见过那么好看的褶边或是绣花那么精美的袖口和衣襟。不过，最引人注目的是他锁的那些扣眼。那些扣眼针脚如此整齐——真是太整齐了，所以我都怀疑一个戴着眼镜、指关节变形，还戴着顶针的老人怎么可能缝出这样的针脚。那些扣眼的针脚是那么细小——实在太细小了，看上去就像是小老鼠缝出来的一样。





小兔本杰明的故事


一天早晨，一只小兔坐在河岸边，他支棱着耳朵，听着一匹小马“嘚嘚嘚嘚”的马蹄声。

一辆双轮马车顺着路而来，赶车的人是麦克格雷格先生，在他旁边坐着麦克格雷格太太，麦克格雷格太太戴着她最好的一顶帽子。

他们刚从路上过去，小兔本杰明就溜到路上，一蹦一跳地出发了，他要去拜访住在树林中的亲戚，那树林就在麦克格雷格先生的菜园后面。

那片树林中满是兔子洞，其中最整洁、沙子最多的一个洞中住着本杰明的姨妈和他的表兄妹们——噗噗、篷篷、棉花尾巴和彼得。

老兔子太太是一个寡妇，她靠着织兔毛手套和围巾来赚钱养家（我曾经还在一个市场中买到过一套）。她还卖药草、迷迭香茶和兔子烟草（就是我们称作薰衣草的东西）。

小兔本杰明并不太想去探望姨妈。他绕到枞树的后面，差点儿被他的表弟彼得绊倒。彼得正独自坐在那里，看起来十分可怜，身上裹着一条红色的棉布手帕。

“彼得，”小兔本杰明叫了他一声，声音非常轻，“你的衣服被谁拿走了？”

彼得回答说：“是麦克格雷格先生菜园里的稻草人。”然后他描述了自己如何被追得满菜园跑，如何丢了鞋子和外套的经历。

小兔本杰明坐在表弟旁边，告诉他麦克格雷格先生已经赶着马车出门了，麦克格雷格太太也跟着出去了，肯定一整天都不会回来，因为她戴着她最好的帽子。

彼得说要是下雨就好了。

这时，老兔子太太的声音从兔子洞中传出来，她喊道：“棉花尾巴！棉花尾巴！给我再拿点甘菊来！”

彼得说，如果可以出去散散步的话，他想他会感觉好点的。于是，彼得和本杰明手拉着手，走到了森林尽头的围墙顶上。从那里，他们能够俯瞰麦克格雷格先生的菜园。他们看得一清二楚，彼得的外套和鞋子都在稻草人身上，稻草人头上还戴着一顶麦克格雷格先生的旧苏格兰圆扁帽。

小兔本杰明说：“从门底下钻进去会把衣服弄坏的，最好能顺着那棵梨树爬下去。”

彼得头朝下栽了下去，不过倒没什么大问题，因为下面的菜地刚刚犁过，十分松软。那里已经种了生菜。他们在整片菜地里都留下了奇怪的小脚印，特别是小兔本杰明，他的脚上穿着木底鞋。

小兔本杰明说首要大事是要拿回彼得的衣服，一会儿可能需要用到彼得现在围着的手帕。他们把衣服从稻草人身上脱了下来。夜里下了雨，鞋子里面有水，外套也有些缩水了。

本杰明试了试苏格兰圆扁帽，但是那帽子对他来说太大了。然后，他建议说，他们应该用手帕包满洋葱，作为送给他姨妈的小礼物。

彼得似乎并不开心，他似乎总是听到许多声音。而本杰明则完全相反，他自得其乐地吃了一片生菜叶子。他说他过去经常跟着他爸爸到菜园里，摘生菜做星期天的大餐。

（小本杰明的爸爸是兔子先生老本杰明。）

生菜当然非常好吃。

彼得什么都没有吃，他说他想要回家了。一会儿工夫，他就丢了一半的洋葱。小本杰明说带着这么多菜，他们没有办法爬上梨树原路返回了。他大胆地领头走向了菜园的另一头。他们在木板小径上走了一段，那小径就在洒满阳光的红砖墙下面。

老鼠们坐在家门口的台阶上，砸着樱桃核。他们冲着小兔彼得和小兔本杰明挤眉弄眼。

彼得不一会儿又把手帕包松开了。他们走在花盆、木架和水桶中间，彼得听到的噪音比刚才还要大，他的眼睛瞪得像棒棒糖一样大！他走在他表哥前面一两步远处，走着走着突然停了下来。

就在墙的拐角那里，两只小兔子看到了令他们大惊失色的东西——一只猫！

小兔本杰明只看了一眼，便立刻带着彼得和洋葱躲进了一个倒扣的大篮子下面。

那只猫站起身来，伸展了一下身体，走过来，嗅了嗅那个篮子。也许她喜欢洋葱的气味。反正，她坐到了篮子的顶上。而且，她在那里一直坐了五个小时。





我没有办法给你们画出彼得和本杰明躲在篮子下面的画面，因为那里太黑了，而洋葱的气味太可怕了，把小兔彼得和小兔本杰明都熏哭了。

太阳落到了树林后面，已经快到傍晚了，那只猫依然坐在篮子上面。后来，从墙上传来一阵“啪嗒”“啪嗒”的声音，还落下来了一些灰泥。猫抬头望去，看到老本杰明先生正昂首阔步地走在上面的围墙顶上。他抽着一个装着兔子烟草的烟斗，手中还拿着一根小树枝。他正在找自己的儿子。

老本杰明先生一点儿都没把那只猫放在眼里。他猛地一跃，从墙上跳下来，跳向那只猫，把它从篮子上打了下去，然后将它踢到了温室里，还从它身上抓下了一把毛。那只猫吓了一大跳，都没有反抗。

老本杰明先生把猫赶入温室后，便锁上了温室的门。然后他走回篮子边，揪着他的儿子小本杰明的耳朵，将他拉了出来，用手中的小细枝抽了他一顿。然后他又将他的外甥彼得也拉了出来。接着他又拉出了包着洋葱的手帕，阔步走出了菜园。

半个小时后，麦克格雷格先生回来了，他注意到很多令他困惑的事情。似乎有个穿着木鞋的人在整个菜园里走了个遍——只是那脚印出奇的小。他也搞不明白那只猫是怎么把自己关进了温室里，又是怎么把外面的门锁给锁上的。

彼得回到家，得到了妈妈的谅解，因为她很高兴看到彼得找回了自己的鞋子和外套。棉花尾巴和彼得将手帕叠起来，而老本杰明先生则把洋葱穿起来，跟一束束的草药和兔子烟草一起挂在了厨房的屋顶上。





两只坏老鼠的故事


从前，有一座非常漂亮的玩偶房，红色的砖墙，白色的窗子，上面还挂着真正的平纹细布做的帘子，房子上有一个前门和一个烟囱。

这座房子是属于两个洋娃娃的，她们分别叫作露辛达和简，更确切地说，露辛达是这里的女主人，不过她从来都不吩咐厨娘做饭。简是厨娘，但是她从来都不做饭，因为玩偶房买来的时候饭已经做好了，就装在一个有很多锯末的盒子中。里面有两只红红的龙虾、一根火腿、一条鱼、一个布丁，另外还有几个梨和橙子。这些东西没办法从盘子上拿下来，不过它们都非常漂亮。

一天早上，露辛达和简坐在娃娃车中出去兜风了。育儿室中没有一个人，非常安静。而就在这时，从壁炉旁边的角落，传来了一阵窸窣的声音，在那里壁脚板的下面有一个洞。

大拇指汤姆把头探出来待了一会儿，然后又缩了回去。大拇指汤姆是一只老鼠。

一分钟之后，他的妻子汉卡曼卡也把头探了出来，她发现育儿室中没有人，便大胆地走到了煤箱下面的油布上。

玩偶房在壁炉的另一边，大拇指汤姆和汉卡曼卡小心翼翼地穿过壁炉前的地毯。他们推了推玩偶房的前门——门并没有闩上。

大拇指汤姆和汉卡曼卡到了玩偶房的楼上，向餐厅望去，然后他们高兴地吱吱叫了起来！

那边桌子上摆的菜肴是多么丰盛可口啊！桌上还摆了锡质的小勺子、铅质的刀叉，桌边还有两个娃娃坐的椅子——一切都太方便了。

大拇指汤姆立刻开始拿刀切火腿。那火腿色泽诱人，黄中透红。但是他手中的刀却卷了刃，还伤到了他，他把手指放在嘴里吮吸说：“这东西没煮熟，太硬了，你来试试，汉卡曼卡。”

汉卡曼卡站在椅子上，拿起另一把铅质的刀去剁火腿。

“这简直和干酪店里的火腿一样硬。”汉卡曼卡说。她非常用力，搞得火腿从盘子中飞了出去，滚到了桌子底下。

“别管它了，”大拇指汤姆说，“递给我些鱼，汉卡曼卡。”

汉卡曼卡挨个拿起桌上的小勺试着去盛鱼。那鱼是粘在盘子上的。然后大拇指汤姆发火了，他把火腿放到屋子中间，拿起火钳子和煤铲子狠狠地砸下去——乓，乓，砰，砰！火腿变成了碎片，因为在闪亮的彩绘外表里面，火腿是石膏做的。

大拇指汤姆和汉卡曼卡的愤怒和失望并没有因此结束。他们又打烂了布丁、龙虾、梨子和橙子。由于鱼没有办法从盘子中弄出来，他们把鱼连同盘子一齐放到了厨房的炉火中，那火是用皱纹纸做的，看上去又红又热，但是鱼却没有点着。大拇指汤姆顺着厨房的烟囱爬了上去，钻出来看了看烟囱顶，那里没有一点儿烟灰。

大拇指汤姆爬上烟囱的时候，汉卡曼卡又发现了另一桩令她失望的事。她看到橱柜中有一些小罐子，上面贴着标签，写着大米、咖啡、西米等字样，但是当她把罐子翻转过来时，里面掉出来的只有一些红色和蓝色的珠子，没有别的。

然后两只老鼠开始了全力大破坏——特别是大拇指汤姆！他把简卧室里抽屉柜中的衣服拿出来，从顶层的窗户扔了下去。

而汉卡曼卡则发扬了勤俭持家的作风，在把露辛达的羽毛靠枕抖落出来一半之后，她突然想起自己正缺一个羽毛床垫，于是在大拇指汤姆的帮助下，她搬着那个靠枕下了楼，拖过炉前的地毯。要把那靠枕塞进老鼠洞可真不容易，但是他们最后还是塞进去了。

然后，汉卡曼卡又回去拿了一把椅子、一个书柜、一个鸟笼和好多其他的小东西。书柜和鸟笼都进不了老鼠洞。汉卡曼卡便将这些东西丢到了煤箱子后面，又去拿了一个摇篮。

汉卡曼卡带着另一把椅子返回来的时候，楼梯平台那边突然传来了一阵说话声。两只老鼠匆匆地回到了他们的洞中，这时娃娃们回到了育儿室。

眼前的景象实在令简和露辛达大吃一惊！

露辛达坐在翻倒的炉子上，看着这一切，简靠着厨房的橱柜，脸上带着微笑——但是她们俩谁都没有对此发表什么评论。

书柜和鸟笼被从煤箱子那儿寻了回来，但是汉卡曼卡已经拿走了摇篮，还拿走了好几件露辛达的衣服。她还拿走了一些有用的壶和锅以及其他几样东西。

拥有这个玩偶房的小女孩说：“我要买一个穿警察衣服的洋娃娃！”

但是她的保姆说：“我要设个老鼠夹子。”

这就是两只坏老鼠的故事了，但其实他们并没有特别特别坏啦，因为大拇指汤姆为他破坏的一切支付了赔偿费。他在炉前地毯的下面捡到了一个变形的六便士的硬币。在圣诞节前夜，他和汉卡曼卡把这个硬币放到了露辛达和简的一只袜子里面。

而每天一大早，所有人都还没有醒来的时候，汉卡曼卡则会带着簸箕和扫把，来打扫那个玩偶房。





碰碰螺太太的故事


从前，有一个叫露西的小女孩，她住在一个叫作“小镇”的农场上。她是一个乖巧的小姑娘——不过她总是把她的手帕弄丢。

有一天，小露西大叫着来到农场的院子中——噢，她是这么叫的：“我丢了我的手帕！三条手帕还有一件围裙！你看到了没有，花斑小猫？”

小猫仍然继续清理着自己的白爪子，所以露西又去问一只芦花母鸡：

“小母鸡萨利，你看到过三条手帕吗？”

但是芦花母鸡跑进了一个谷仓里，嘴里咯咯咯地叫着：

“我光着脚呢，光着脚呢，光着脚啊！”

然后，露西去问栖息在树枝上的雄知更鸟。雄知更鸟用他闪亮的黑眼睛斜了露西一眼，然后掠过矮土墙，飞走了。

露西爬上矮土墙，眺望着小镇后面的那座山——那座山好高，好高，直入云霄，高得好像没有顶。她觉得自己看见山腰的草地上有些白色的东西摊着，就在很远很高的地方。

露西以她的小短腿能达到的最快速度向山上爬，她沿着那条陡峭的山间小径向上跑，一直向上，一直向上，直到小镇被她远远地抛在了下面，她甚至可以把一颗石头直接丢到烟囱里面去。

没一会儿，她来到了一眼泉水旁边，泉水汩汩地从山腰流出。有人把一个罐子放在了泉水边的石头上接水，但是水都溢了出来，因为那罐子只有鸡蛋杯那么大。小径的沙子是湿的，那上面有许多非常小的脚印。

露西继续跑啊跑。

小径的尽头在一块大石头的下面。那里的草很矮，但是很绿，那里有欧洲蕨的茎做的晾衣杆，中间的绳子则是编织成辫子状的灯芯草，上面挂着小小的衣服夹子——但是没有手帕。不过那里还有别的东西——那是一扇门！直接通向山里面，在门内有人正唱着歌：





纯白无瑕又干净，哦！

小小饰边平又整，哦！

光滑滑，热乎乎，

红红的锈斑呀，从来都没有，哦！





露西敲了一下门，然后又敲了一下，打断了这歌声。一个有点儿受惊的声音问道：“是谁啊？”

露西打开门，你们猜露西在里面看到了什么？——那里有一间整洁可爱的厨房，石板铺的地面，木头的梁柱，就和普通农场里的厨房一样。只是屋顶实在很矮很矮，露西的头几乎就顶着房顶了，厨房里面的水壶和锅也都很小，屋里所有的东西都很小。

屋子里有一股好闻而又热乎乎的焦味儿，有一个矮矮胖胖的人，手里拿着一个熨斗，正紧张地望着露西。她身上穿的印花长袍被卷了起来，在她的条纹衬裙外面是一条大围裙。小小的黑鼻头抽抽，又嗅嗅，她的眼睛不停地眨呀眨。而在她帽子的下面——露西长着黄色的鬈发——这个小人儿却长着刺。

“你是谁？”露西问，“你看到我的手帕了吗？”

这个小人儿行了一个屈膝礼说：“噢，是的，如果你愿意的话，可以叫我碰碰螺太太。噢，对，你相信吗，我可是一个优秀的浆洗工。”然后，她从洗衣篮里面拿出了一样东西，然后摊开，铺在了熨衣毯上。

“那是什么？”露西问，“那不是我的手帕吗？”

“噢，不是的，抱歉，这件小小的红色马甲是雄知更鸟的。”

然后她熨了那件马甲，叠好放在一边。接着她又从衣架上拿下了什么。

“那不是我的围裙吗？”露西说。

“噢，不是的，抱歉，这是鹪鹩珍妮的缎子桌布。看看这一大片酒渍！非常难洗。”碰碰螺太太说。

碰碰螺太太的鼻子抽了抽，又抽了抽，然后又大声地抽了一下，她的眼睛眨了眨，又眨了眨。然后她从火上拿下了另一个热烫的熨斗。

“那是我的一块手帕！”露西叫道，“那是我的围裙。”

碰碰螺太太将围裙熨好，压出褶皱，抖开荷叶边。

“噢，真是太好了！”露西说，“那些有着手套一样分指的长长的黄东西是什么呀？”

“噢，那是小母鸡萨利的长筒袜——看看呀，她整天刨地，脚后跟儿都破了。用不了多久她就得光着脚了。”碰碰螺太太说。

“哎呀，还有一块手帕——不过不是我的，这条是红色的吧？”

“噢，不是你的，抱歉，这是老兔子太太的，上面一股洋葱味！我洗它的时候是单独洗的，怎么也洗不掉那股气味。”

“那是我的另一块手帕。”露西说，“那些好玩的白色的小东西是什么呀？”

“那是小花斑猫的露指手套。我只需要熨烫它们，因为是她自己洗的。”

“那是我的最后一块手帕！”露西说，“你放到水淀粉盆子里面的是什么？”

“这是小老鼠汤姆的小衬衫前襟——他讲究得过分！”碰碰螺太太说，“我已经熨完了。现在得把一些衣服晾一晾。”

“那些可爱的、软软的、毛茸茸的东西是什么？”露西问。

“噢，这些是斯凯高尔的小羊们的羊毛外套。”

“他们的外套能脱下来吗？”露西问。

“噢，是的，来看看肩膀上的这些羊的记号。有一个是盖茨盖斯的记号，还有三个是小镇的。他们总是在这些要洗的东西上做标记。”碰碰螺太太说。

然后，她把各种各样、大大小小的衣物挂了起来，里面有老鼠们的棕色小外套；还有一件软软的黑色鼹鼠皮马甲；松鼠坚果金的一件红色无尾燕尾服；小兔彼得的一件缩水严重的蓝色夹克；还有一件衬裙，上面没有标记，应该是在洗涤的过程中掉了——最后，篮子终于空了。

接着，碰碰螺太太去泡了茶，一杯给自己，一杯给露西。她们坐在壁炉前的一条长凳上，侧脸看着彼此。碰碰螺太太端着茶杯的手是极深的棕色，皱皱的，上面还挂着肥皂泡，她的长袍和帽子上都是刺到外面的“发针”，所以，露西并不想坐得离她太近。

她们喝完茶后，把衣服包进包袱里。露西的手帕都被叠起来放到了干净的围裙里，然后用一根银别针固定好。然后，她们往火里添了些泥炭，便出了门，锁好门后，把钥匙藏在了门缝下面。露西和碰碰螺太太带着一大包衣服。一路飞快地走下了山。

下山的路上，时不时就会有小动物从草丛中出来迎接她们，她们最先见到的是小兔彼得和小兔本杰明。碰碰螺太太把干净、整洁的衣服给了他们，所有的小动物和小鸟都对碰碰螺太太非常感激。等她们到了山脚，来到了矮土墙边时，她们手上已经只剩下露西的小包袱了。

露西拿着小包袱爬上了矮土墙，然后转身向这位洗衣妇道晚安并表示谢意。但是真奇怪啊！碰碰螺太太既没有等着她道谢，也没有要洗衣费，而是一路跑啊跑啊跑，跑上山——她的荷叶边小白帽怎么不见了呢？她的围巾呢？她的袍子呢？还有她的衬裙呢？

哎呀，她可真小啊——颜色是非常深的棕色——而且还长满了刺！

哎呀！碰碰螺太太原来就是一只刺猬。





有些人说小露西是在矮土墙上面睡着了——但她又是怎么找到三条干净的手帕和一件围裙，而且还用安全别针固定在一起的呢？

另外，我曾经见过通向那座叫作“猫铃山”后山中的门，另外我和亲爱的碰碰螺太太可是很熟的！





馅饼和馅饼模子的故事


从前，有一只叫瑞比的小猫，她邀请一只叫公爵夫人的小狗来吃茶点。

“尽早过来，我亲爱的公爵夫人，”瑞比的信中这么写道，“我们会享用一些非常非常好的东西。我正在用一个带粉色花边的馅饼盘烘烤它哦。你从来都没吃过这么好吃的东西！你会把它全都吃掉的。而我会吃松饼，亲爱的公爵夫人。”

公爵夫人读了这封信，并写了回信：“我非常开心受到邀请，我会在四点一刻拜访。但是，真是巧了，我本来是正要邀请你来我这里吃晚饭的，我亲爱的瑞比，我想请你吃一些最最美味的东西。”

“我会准时到达的，我亲爱的瑞比，”公爵夫人写道。在信的结尾，她又加了一句，“我希望不是老鼠肉吧？”不过，她又觉得这样写似乎显得不太礼貌，所以，她便把“不是老鼠肉吧”给划掉了，改成了“我希望天气会很好”，然后将信交给了邮差。但是，她一直在琢磨瑞比的馅饼，所以，便将瑞比的信读了一遍又一遍。

“我真担心死了，万一是老鼠肉呢！”公爵夫人自言自语道，“我真的真的吃不下老鼠肉馅饼。而我却不得不吃，因为这是一次聚会。我本来要烤牛肉和火腿馅饼的。一个粉边的白色馅饼盘子！我的盘子也是这样的，和瑞比的一样，都是在塔比莎·特迟特的店里买的。”

公爵夫人走进她的食品储藏室，从架子上拿下馅饼，看了又看，说道：“一切都准备好了，就差放进烤箱里了。多么可爱的馅饼脆皮啊，我把原料放在了一个小的馅饼模子里面，这样就能保持脆皮的形状，我还用叉子在馅饼中间戳了一个洞，以便排出蒸汽——啊，我真希望能够吃我自己的馅饼啊，而不是用老鼠肉做的馅饼。”

公爵夫人思来想去，于是又把瑞比的信读了一遍：

“一个带粉边的白色馅饼盘——你会把它整个吃光的。‘你’是指我——那么，瑞比自己是不会尝那个馅饼了？一个粉边的白色馅饼盘！瑞比肯定会去外面买松饼……啊，真是个好主意！为什么我不趁瑞比不在的时候赶过去，把我的馅饼放进瑞比的烤箱里面呢？”公爵夫人非常满意自己的聪明。

同时，瑞比接到了公爵夫人的回信，一得知小狗能来赴约，她便把她的馅饼放到了烤箱里。她有两个烤箱，摞在一起，一个上，一个下。她的烤箱上有些把手和手柄都是装饰性的，并不能打开烤箱。瑞比把馅饼放到了下面的那个烤箱里，那个烤箱的门很难开。

“上面的这个烤箱烤东西时火太急了。”瑞比对自己说，“这是一个用最细嫩的老鼠肉混合培根做成的馅饼，我把所有骨头都去掉了，上一次我宴请公爵夫人的时候，她差一点儿被鱼骨头给卡得窒息了。她吃东西有点儿快——又总是大口大口地吃。但她是一只非常有教养又文雅的小狗，如果选朋友，她相比于塔比莎·特迟特表姐来说，简直是好得太多了。”

瑞比又加了一些煤，并清理了炉边。然后她带着一个水罐到了井边打水，灌满水壶。接着，她开始整理房间——这个房间既用作客厅也用作厨房。她在前门把垫子抖了抖，又放平整，炉前地毯是一块兔皮的。她擦拭了时钟和壁炉台上的摆设，又把桌椅都擦得光可鉴人。

然后，她又铺开一张干净的白色桌布，从壁炉旁的壁橱中拿出了她最好的一套瓷器摆好。那茶杯是白色的，上面有粉色玫瑰的花纹，而餐盘则是蓝白相间的。

瑞比摆放好桌子之后，便带上一个罐子和一个蓝白相间的盘子，穿过田野，去附近的农场，取牛奶和黄油。回来之后，她看了看下面的烤箱，里面的馅饼看上去非常不错。

瑞比围上围巾，戴上小帽，提上篮子，又出门了，她要去村子里的商店买一包茶叶、一磅方糖和一瓶果酱。

而就在这时，公爵夫人离开了她在村子另一头的家。

瑞比在街上碰到了公爵夫人，看到她也提着篮子，上面盖着一块布。她们彼此弓身致意，但没有说话，因为她们就要聚会了。

公爵夫人一走过街角，离开瑞比的视线，便跑了起来——直奔瑞比的家！

瑞比去了商店，买了需要的东西，和塔比莎·特迟特表姐开心地闲聊了几句，然后才离开。

后来，塔比莎表姐提起这件事时，非常不屑。

“请一只小狗！就好像索里这一带没有猫一样！居然准备了一个馅饼在下午茶时吃！真想得出来！”塔比莎·特迟特表姐说。

瑞比又去了蒂莫西面包房买了松饼，然后才回家。就在她从前门进去的时候，后面的走廊传来了窸窸窣窣的声音。

“我相信这不是喜鹊捣的乱，而且勺子也都锁起来了。”瑞比说。不过，没发现有人在那儿。瑞比用了些力气打开下面的烤箱门，把馅饼翻了一面。已经开始闻到烤鼠肉散发出的阵阵诱人的香气了。

而就在这时，公爵夫人从后门溜了出去。“真奇怪，我把我的馅饼放到烤箱里时，并没有看到瑞比的馅饼呀。四处都找不到，我可是把整个房子都找了一遍了。我把馅饼放到了上面那个漂亮的热烤箱里。但转不动其他的把手，那些应该都是样子货。”公爵夫人说，“但我真希望能够拿走那个用老鼠肉做的馅饼！真不知道瑞比到底把它放哪儿去了，我听到瑞比回来了，不得不从后门跑出来。”

公爵夫人回到家，把她美丽的黑色皮毛梳了好几遍，然后从自家的花园里面采了一束花，作为送给瑞比的礼物，时间就这么过去了，时钟敲了四下，已是四点钟了。

瑞比把自己的家仔细检查了一遍，确认不论是壁橱里还是食品储藏室里面都没有藏着任何人，然后便上楼去换了一条裙子。她穿上一件淡紫色的丝绸长裙，围上一件绣花的平纹细布围裙和一条披肩。

“真奇怪，”瑞比说，“我不记得自己把抽屉打开了，是有人想要试我的连指手套吗？”她又下楼去，泡了茶，然后把茶壶放在炉架上。接着她又看了看下面的烤箱，馅饼现在已经变成了诱人的焦黄色，热气腾腾的。

她坐在壁炉前面，等候小狗的来访。“还好我用了下面的那个烤箱。”瑞比说，“上面那个肯定太热了。真奇怪，壁橱的门怎么是开着的呀？难道家里真的有人进来过？”

四点整，公爵夫人出发去参加聚会。她以自己最快的速度穿过了村子，结果到瑞比家的时候太早了，所以就站在通向瑞比家的小巷子里等了一会儿。

“瑞比有没有把我的馅饼从烤箱里拿出来呢？”公爵夫人说，“另一个用老鼠做的馅饼到底哪儿去了？”

四点一刻，准时响起了一声最最文雅的轻轻的敲门声。“瑞比斯通太太在家吗？”公爵夫人站在门廊上问道。

“快请进！你好吗，我亲爱的公爵夫人？”瑞比叫道，“希望你一切都好啊！”

“非常好，谢谢，你呢，我亲爱的瑞比？”公爵夫人说，“我给你带了些花来，好香的馅饼味啊！”

“啊，这花真漂亮啊！对，馅饼是老鼠肉和培根馅的。”

“先别谈吃的，我亲爱的瑞比，”公爵夫人说，“好漂亮的茶巾啊！……那馅饼翻过面了吗？还在烤箱里吗？”

“我觉得还需要五分钟才能熟。”瑞比说，“再等一小会儿就行。趁着这工夫，我来倒茶吧！你需要加糖吗，亲爱的公爵夫人？”

“噢，加，谢谢！我亲爱的瑞比，我能拿一块放在我的鼻子上吗？”

“当然可以，亲爱的公爵夫人，你的请求实在太有礼貌了！你真是太可爱太可亲了！”

公爵夫人把糖放在自己的鼻子上，嗅了嗅，说：“馅饼的味道闻起来真好啊！我真喜欢牛肉和火腿——我是说老鼠肉和培根——”慌乱之中，她把糖弄掉了，不得不钻到茶几下面去寻找，所以她并没有看到瑞比拿馅饼的时候打开的是哪一个烤箱。

瑞比把馅饼放在了桌子上，那馅饼散发的香味真能让人口水都流下来。

公爵夫人嚼着糖从桌布下面钻了出来，在一把椅子上坐好。

“我先替你切馅饼，我要吃些松饼和果酱。”瑞比说。

“你真的更喜欢松饼吗？小心那馅饼模子！”

“抱歉，你说什么？”瑞比说。

“要我把果酱递给你吗？”公爵夫人匆忙掩饰说。

馅饼十分可口，松饼绵软热乎，都很快被一扫而光，特别是馅饼！

公爵夫人心里想，“我觉得如果我自己拿馅饼的话会更好，尽管瑞比在切的时候似乎并没有注意到什么。这馅饼被烘烤得成了这么细的小块儿！我真不记得我把肉馅切得这么碎。我猜，这个烤箱比我自己的那个要加热快。”

“公爵夫人吃得可真快！”瑞比一边给自己的第五块松饼涂黄油一边想。

馅饼盘子很快就空了！公爵夫人已经吃了四块馅饼，正用勺子探索着什么。

“再来点儿培根吧，亲爱的公爵夫人？”瑞比说。

“谢谢了，亲爱的瑞比，我只是想找馅饼模子。”

“馅饼模子？亲爱的公爵夫人，你说什么？”

“就是让馅饼外皮保持形状的馅饼模子。”公爵夫人黑色皮毛下的脸红了。

“噢，我没用馅饼模子，亲爱的公爵夫人，”瑞比说，“我觉得做老鼠肉馅饼没必要用馅饼模子。”

公爵夫人仍在用勺子搜寻着。“我找不到了。”她焦急地说。

“没有馅饼模子。”瑞比看起来十分困惑。

“是啊，真的，亲爱的瑞比，它跑哪儿去了呢？”公爵夫人说。

“肯定没有，亲爱的公爵夫人。我不喜欢在布丁和馅饼里放铁皮做的东西，太不方便了——尤其是有人狼吞虎咽的时候。”瑞比又低声补充说。

公爵夫人看起来惊慌不已，继续在馅饼盘里面挖。

“我姑婆斯奎提娜，也就是塔比莎·特迟特表姐的祖母，就因为在圣诞节的时候，吃李子布丁吃到了一个顶针给噎死了。我从来都不在我的布丁和馅饼里面放金属做的东西。”

公爵夫人大吃一惊，把馅饼盘翻了过来。

“我只有四个馅饼模子，现在都在壁橱里面呢。”

公爵夫人发出一阵哀号。

“我要死了！我要死了！我吞了一个馅饼模子！啊，亲爱的瑞比，我觉得不舒服极了。”

“不可能，亲爱的公爵夫人，根本没有什么馅饼模子。”

公爵夫人呻吟着，哀号着，身子摇来摇去。

“我觉得很难受，我肯定吞了一个馅饼模子。”

“馅饼里面什么都没有。”瑞比很郑重地说。

“有的，有的，亲爱的瑞比，我肯定吞下去了。”

“我拿个枕头给你靠着吧，亲爱的公爵夫人，你觉得那馅饼模子在哪儿？”

“啊，我觉得我浑身都难受，亲爱的瑞比，我肯定吞了一个大个儿的馅饼模子，还有着尖锐的扇贝状的边儿。”

“需要我去请医生吗？我把勺子锁起来就行。”

“噢，需要，需要！快去请玛戈蒂医生，亲爱的瑞比，他就姓馅饼，是只喜鹊[1]，他肯定能理解我的。”

瑞比将公爵夫人安顿在壁炉前的扶手椅里面，便匆匆忙忙地出门去请村子里的医生。她在铁匠铺找到了医生。医生正在忙着把生锈的钉子放到一个墨水瓶里面，墨水瓶是他在邮局得到的。

“熏猪腿？哈？哈？”他说话的时候头侧向一边。

瑞比解释说自己的客人吞下了一个馅饼模子。

“菠菜？哈？哈？”他说着，动作迅速地走到了瑞比身边。

他跳着向前走，速度非常快，瑞比不得不跑着才能跟上。这简直太引人注目了。整个村子的人都看到瑞比请来了医生。

“我就知道她们肯定会吃撑了的！”塔比莎表姐说。

就在瑞比找医生时，公爵夫人遇到了一件怪事儿。她独自坐在壁炉前面，呻吟着，觉得非常不开心。

“我怎么会吞下去呢！馅饼模子那么大的东西！”

她站起身，走到桌边，又用勺子在馅饼盘里面找馅饼模子。

“没有，这里没有，我肯定放了一个进去的，除了我也没有人吃馅饼，我肯定是把它吞下去了！”

她又坐下来，满怀悲伤地盯着壁炉架。火噼噼啪啪地烧着，火苗舞动着，这个时候，有什么东西发出了嗞嗞的声音。

公爵夫人吃了一惊！她打开了上层烤箱的门，从里面冒出了浓郁的牛肉和火腿的香气，里面是一个诱人的棕色馅饼。而通过脆皮上面的那个小孔，可以看到里面有一个小小的金属做的馅饼模子。

公爵夫人长长地吸了一口气。“那么，我肯定是吃了老鼠肉了！……难怪我觉得难受呢！……不过如果我吞了馅饼模子，应该会更难受吧。”公爵夫人回想着，“这要跟瑞比解释，可真是尴尬死了！我想我还是把我的馅饼放到后院，什么都不说的好。等我回家的时候，可以绕到后面把它拿走。”她把馅饼放到了后门外面，又在火炉边坐好，闭上眼睛。等瑞比带着医生来到的时候，她似乎已经睡熟了。

“熏猪腿，哈，哈？”医生说。

“我觉得好多了。”公爵夫人一下子醒了过来。

“听到这消息我真的非常开心。他给你带来了药，亲爱的公爵夫人！”

“我觉得，他光给我把把脉就够了。”公爵夫人后退一步，离嘴里含着东西悄悄走进的喜鹊远了一些。

“这只是个面包药丸，你最好吃了它，然后再喝点牛奶，亲爱的公爵夫人。”

“熏猪腿？熏猪腿？”医生说，这时公爵夫人咳嗽起来，甚至有点儿透不过气。

“别说了！”瑞比控制不住自己的脾气了，“给，拿上这块果酱面包，立刻出去，到院子里去！”

“熏猪腿和菠菜！哈哈哈！”后门外传来玛戈蒂医生欢欣雀跃的喊叫声。

“我觉得好多了，亲爱的瑞比，”公爵夫人说，“你说，我是不是最好在天黑之前回家呢？”

“也许的确是这样的，亲爱的公爵夫人，我给你找条又漂亮又暖和的披肩，你可以挽着我的胳膊，我送你回去。”

“无论如何我都不该再麻烦你了，我真的觉得好多了。玛戈蒂医生的一颗药——”

“如果它把你吞的馅饼模子给治好了，那的确是很神奇啊！明天吃过早饭之后我会去拜访你，看看你睡得怎么样。”

瑞比和公爵夫人热情地道别，公爵夫人便启程回家。走到巷子一半的地方，她停了下来，转身看了看，瑞比已经回屋关上了门。公爵夫人偷偷地翻过栅栏，绕到瑞比房子的后面，向院子里望。

猪圈的顶上，玛戈蒂医生和三只寒鸦正落在那里。寒鸦们正在吃着馅饼的脆皮，而喜鹊医生正在喝着馅饼模子里面的肉汤。

“熏猪腿，哈，哈！”看到公爵夫人的小黑鼻子从拐角处露出来的时候，他叫道。

公爵夫人一路跑回了家，感觉自己简直蠢透了！

当瑞比出来准备打一桶水回去洗茶具的时候，看到院子中间有一个打碎了的粉边白底的馅饼盘。馅饼模子就在水泵下面，是玛戈蒂医生故意留在那里的。

瑞比吃惊地盯着它：“谁遇到过这样的事情呢！那么真的是有一个馅饼模子？而我的馅饼模子都在厨房的壁橱里面。好吧，我从来都没有用过。下一次我要是再办聚会——还是邀请塔比莎表姐吧。”

渔夫杰瑞米先生的故事


从前，有一只青蛙，名字叫渔夫杰瑞米先生，他住在池塘边金凤花丛中一座潮湿的小房子里。

他的食品储藏室和后面的过道里四处都是水，湿漉漉的，非常容易滑倒。但是杰瑞米先生就喜欢把脚弄湿，没有人因此而数落过他，他也没有因此感冒过。

当他向屋外看去，看到大滴大滴的雨点溅落在池塘上的时候，非常开心。

“我应该弄些虫子去钓鱼，钓一盘子米诺鱼当晚餐。”渔夫杰瑞米先生说，“如果我能够抓到五条以上的鱼，我就请我的朋友乌龟奥尔德曼·托勒密先生和艾萨克·牛顿爵士来吃饭。只是奥尔德曼先生吃生菜。”

杰瑞米先生穿上了他的雨衣和雨鞋，拿上鱼竿和篮子，便大步跳着前往他停放小船的地方。

小船是圆圆的，绿色的，很像一片荷叶，被绑在池塘中央的一株水生植物上。杰瑞米先生用一根芦苇做篙，将船推向了开阔的水域。“我知道一个钓米诺鱼的好地方。”渔夫杰瑞米先生说。

杰瑞米先生把芦苇篙插入泥中，然后将船拴在上面固定。之后他便盘腿坐好，开始收拾他的钓鱼用具。他的红色小浮标非常可爱，他的鱼竿是一根坚韧的草茎，他的鱼线是一根细长的白色马尾毛，他在鱼线尾端绑上了一个扭来扭去的小虫子。

雨点敲打着他的后背，将近一个小时，他一直盯着浮标。

“这有点儿无聊，我觉得我应该吃些午餐。”渔夫杰瑞米先生说。

他撑船回到原来的地方，从篮子里面拿了一些午餐出来。

“我要吃一个蝴蝶三明治，然后等雨停了再钓。”渔夫杰瑞米先生说。

一只大个儿的水甲虫在荷叶船下面，用力拉他一只雨鞋的鞋尖。

杰瑞米先生把腿又盘了盘，这下水甲虫够不到了，他继续吃午餐。

在池塘的边上，偶尔会有东西移动，发出一阵“沙沙”或是“啪啪”的声音。

“我敢肯定那不是老鼠。”渔夫杰瑞米先生说，“我觉得我最好还是离开这里。”

杰瑞米先生又将船向外划了一小段距离，将鱼饵放入水中，几乎立刻就有东西咬了钩，浮标猛烈地上下晃动。

“一条米诺鱼！一条米诺鱼！我钩住他的鼻子了！”渔夫杰瑞米先生叫着，一边用力地拉鱼竿。但真是个可怕的意外啊！杰瑞米先生钓上来的并不是一条滑溜肥美的米诺鱼，而是棘鱼小杰克·夏普，他身上可是长满了刺！小棘鱼在船上拼命挣扎，四处乱刺乱咬，直到最后快喘不过气来了。然后他又跳回了水里面。一群其他种类的小鱼把头探出水面，嘲笑渔夫杰瑞米先生。

而杰瑞米先生则哭丧着脸坐在他的小船边——吮吸着他疼痛的手指，盯着水面——然后，更加糟糕的事情发生了。我是说，如果杰瑞米先生没有穿雨衣的话，那可真会是一件极端可怕的事情了。

一只超级巨大的鳟鱼游了过来——噗噗噗噗——伴随着一阵水花声，他一口咬住了杰瑞米先生。“哦！哦！哦！”然后转身潜入了池塘底部。但是鳟鱼非常不喜欢雨衣的味道，没过半分钟就把杰瑞米先生吐了出去，只是他把杰瑞米先生的雨鞋吞下去了。

杰瑞米先生弹回到水面上，就像是一个软木塞或是汽水瓶中的气泡一般。然后他用尽全力游向了池塘的岸边。一触到岸，他就挣扎着爬出水面，然后穿过草地一路跳回了家。他的雨衣已经都碎了。

“幸好那不是一条梭鱼！”渔夫杰瑞米先生说，“我把鱼竿和篮子给丢了，不过这不重要，因为我肯定我绝对不敢再去钓鱼了。”他在手指上缠了一些胶布。他的两个朋友都来他家吃晚饭，但是他没有鱼招待他们了。不过他的食品储藏室里面还有其他食物。

艾萨克·牛顿爵士穿着他的黑色和金色相间的马甲。奥尔德曼·托勒密先生用网兜提了一棵生菜过来。

他们没有享用到美味的米诺鱼，但是却吃了配瓢虫酱的烤蚂蚱，青蛙们都觉得这是一道佳肴。但我觉得味道肯定很糟糕！





一只超级坏的兔子的故事


有一只超级坏的兔子，看看他那野蛮的胡子，看看他的爪子，还有翘起来的尾巴！

还有一只温顺可爱的兔子，他妈妈给了他一根胡萝卜。

坏兔子也想吃胡萝卜。他没有说“请给我一些”，而是直接抢了过去。他还把好兔子给抓伤了，抓得很严重。

好兔子溜走了，躲进一个洞里面，他很难过。

这时来了一个拿着枪的人。他看到木头长凳上坐着一个东西，觉得那应该是只很好玩的小鸟。他用树做掩护，悄悄地向前移动。然后他开枪了——砰！

接着发生的事情是这样的：当那个人拿着枪跑到长凳边的时候，找到的只是一根胡萝卜和一条兔子尾巴。

好兔子从躲藏的洞中偷偷向外看。他看到坏兔子飞快地从眼前跑过——胡子和尾巴都不见了！





娃娃小姐的故事


有一只小猫咪名叫娃娃小姐。她觉得自己听到了老鼠的动静。

原来有一只老鼠贼头贼脑地从橱柜后面向外看，他想捉弄一下娃娃小姐，他并不害怕小奶猫。

娃娃小姐跳起来得太晚了，没有抓到老鼠，却撞到了自己的头。她觉得那个橱柜好硬啊！

老鼠爬到了橱柜的顶上望着娃娃小姐。

娃娃小姐用抹布把自己的头包了起来，坐在炉火前。

老鼠觉得她肯定很不舒服，于是顺着拉铃绳滑了下来。

娃娃小姐的状况看起来越来越糟。老鼠一点点地靠近她。

娃娃小姐用爪子抱着自己可怜的脑袋，透过抹布上的一个小洞看着老鼠。老鼠已经离她非常近了。就在这时，突然之间，娃娃小姐跳起来扑向老鼠。

因为老鼠戏弄了娃娃小姐，所以娃娃小姐觉得自己也应该戏弄老鼠一下——虽然她这么做不太善良！她把老鼠包在抹布里，把它像球一样丢来丢去。但是她忘记抹布上有个洞了，所以，等她解开抹布的时候，发现老鼠已经不见了。老鼠从小洞里钻出来逃走了，他现在正在橱柜顶上跳吉格舞呢！





小猫汤姆的故事


从前，有三只小猫，他们的名字分别是：咪咪、汤姆和娃娃。他们都有一身可爱的软皮毛，喜欢在门前的台阶上打滚，喜欢在尘土中玩耍。

但是有一天，他们的妈妈——塔比莎·特迟特太太——要招待朋友们来喝茶，所以，她在客人到来之前，把小猫们拎到了屋中，给他们洗澡，换上新衣服。她先是擦洗了他们的脸（先是娃娃）。接着她梳顺了他们的毛（接着是咪咪）。然后她梳了他们的尾巴和胡子（最后是汤姆）。汤姆非常淘气，他不断乱抓。

塔比莎太太给娃娃和咪咪穿上了干净的围裙和领巾，然后她从一个抽屉中拿出了各式各样优雅却不舒服的衣服，来打扮她的儿子汤姆。小猫汤姆很胖，而且他个子很高，有好几颗扣子都绷掉了。他妈妈只好把扣子再缝上去。

三只小猫都被收拾整齐后，塔比莎太太很不明智地让他们去了花园里，以免他们在她烤黄油吐司的时候碍事。

“不要弄脏衣服，孩子们！你们必须直立着用后腿走路。离脏兮兮的灰坑远点儿，离母鸡萨利远些，别靠近猪圈和泥潭鸭。”

娃娃和咪咪摇摇晃晃地走在花园的小路上。没多久，她们就踩到了围裙，摔了个嘴啃泥。等她们再站起来的时候，衣服上已经有了好几块绿色的污渍。

“咱们去爬假山吧，坐到花园围墙上去。”娃娃说。

她们把围裙前后调换了一下，让后面朝前，然后便蹦蹦跳跳地出发了。娃娃的白色领巾掉落到了地上。

小猫汤姆的后腿上穿着裤子，没有办法跳跃，只能一点一点地爬上假山，他弄断了些蕨草，衣服上的扣子掉得东一个西一个。等到他爬上围墙的时候，身上的衣服已经七零八落了。娃娃和咪咪合力将他拉了上来，他的帽子掉了下去，其余的扣子全都绷开了。

就在小猫们身陷麻烦的时候，传来了一阵“啪啦”“啪嗒”的声音，原来有三只泥潭鸭顺着坚硬的大路走了过来，他们排成一列，迈着方步——“啪啦！”“啪嗒！”“啪啦！”“啪嗒！”

他们停下脚步，站成一排，盯着小猫们。泥潭鸭们的眼睛很小，看上去很吃惊。然后，其中两只鸭子——瑞贝卡和杰迈玛——捡起了地上的帽子和领巾，戴到了自己身上。

咪咪不禁哈哈大笑，笑得从墙上跌了下去。娃娃和汤姆跟在她后面也下去了，在下去的过程中，娃娃和咪咪的围裙以及汤姆剩下的衣服都掉了下来。

“过来！泥潭鸭德雷克先生，”娃娃说，“过来帮我们给他穿上衣服！过来给他扣扣子！”

泥潭鸭德雷克先生慢悠悠地侧着身子走了过去，捡起地上散落的那些衣服。但是他把衣服都穿在了自己的身上。那些衣服穿在他身上非常不合适，比在小猫汤姆身上还不合适。

“真是个晴朗的早晨啊！”泥潭鸭德雷克先生说。然后他和杰迈玛、瑞贝卡继续迈着方步前行——“啪啦！”“啪嗒！”“啪啦！”“啪嗒！”

这时，塔比莎·特迟特来到花园，看到她的小猫们都在墙上，身上的衣服却都不见了。她把他们从墙上拉下来，狠狠地揍了一顿，然后把他们带回了家中。

“我的朋友们马上就要来了。你们几个不能被人看见，真是快被你们气死了！”塔比莎·特迟特太太说。她把他们赶去了楼上，很遗憾，她对朋友们说小猫们生了麻疹卧病在床，当然，这并不是真的。相反，他们没在床上，根本没有。

不知怎么，就在茶会举行的时候，楼上总是传来阵阵噪音，打扰了茶会优雅安静的氛围。

我想，有一天，我会再写一本书，很大的一本，告诉你们关于小猫汤姆的更多故事。

至于泥潭鸭，他们去了一个水塘里。那些衣服立刻就都掉下去了，因为衣服上都没有纽扣。从那之后，德雷克、杰迈玛和瑞贝卡一直在寻找那些衣服。





泥潭鸭杰迈玛的故事


要是你看到一群新出壳的小鸭子和一只母鸡在一起的画面，你肯定会觉得非常有意思——下面来听听泥潭鸭杰迈玛的故事，因为农夫的妻子不让她自己孵蛋，她气坏了。

她的嫂子，泥潭鸭瑞贝卡太太却非常乐意把孵化工作交给其他人来完成——“我可没有耐心在一个窝里趴上二十八天。你也不会有的，杰迈玛。你会让那些蛋变冷，你知道你会的。”

“我希望能够孵化我自己的蛋，我愿意自己孵化它们！”杰迈玛嘎嘎叫着。她想把自己的蛋藏起来，不过总是会被农夫找到并拿走。

杰迈玛越来越绝望，最后决定在远离农场的地方做个窝。在一个明媚的春日午后，她沿着那条通往山里的马车道出发了。出发时，她披上一条披肩，戴着一顶阔边女帽。到达山顶的时候，她看到不远处有一片树林。她觉得那里是个非常安全而且安静的地方。

杰迈玛并不太习惯飞行。她向山下助跑了一段距离，她的披肩噗啦啦翻飞，然后她跃向了空中。她开始得很好，便飞得很漂亮。她从树顶上掠过，直到看到树林中有一片开阔地带，那里没有树木，也没有灌木。

杰迈玛降落得非常笨拙，然后便开始四处溜达，想要选一个方便而干燥的地点做窝。她很喜欢一个在高高的毛地黄丛中的树桩。但是，她惊讶地发现，有一个穿着非常优雅的绅士正坐在那个树桩上看报纸。他长着黑色的尖耳朵，还有浅棕色的胡须。

“嘎？”杰迈玛把头和头上的小帽子侧向一边，“嘎？”

那位绅士把视线从报纸上移开，好奇地看着杰迈玛。

“夫人，您迷路了吗？”他说。他有一条浓密的尾巴，他就坐在尾巴上面，因为那个树桩有些潮湿。

杰迈玛觉得他很文雅，也很英俊，便解释说自己并没有迷路，只是想找一个方便而干燥的地点搭窝。

“啊！是这样？真的吗？”那位长着浅棕色胡须的绅士说，还好奇地看着杰迈玛。他把报纸折起来放到了自己大衣后摆的口袋中。

杰迈玛正在抱怨那只多管闲事的母鸡。

“真的？真有意思。我真希望自己能见一见那只家禽，我很愿意教会她管好自己的事情就够了。至于做窝嘛——这没有什么难的。我的小木屋里有很多羽毛。不，亲爱的夫人，您不会打扰任何人了，只要您高兴，您愿意在那里待多久都可以。”长着毛茸茸长尾巴的绅士说。他领着杰迈玛来到了毛地黄丛中一座看上去废弃了很久、很破旧的房子。

这房子是用木柴和草皮盖的，两个摞在一起的破桶充作烟囱。

“这里是我避暑的地方，您会觉得我的洞穴——也就是我冬季的住所——没有这里这么方便。”好客的绅士说。

在房子后部，有一个几乎快塌了的棚子，那是用旧的肥皂箱子搭成的。绅士打开了门，领着杰迈玛进了屋。那棚子里面，四处都是羽毛——多得几乎让人喘不过气来，但是真的非常舒适而且柔软。

杰迈玛看到这么多羽毛，非常吃惊。但是这里实在太舒服了，她毫不费力地就做好了一个窝。

当杰迈玛出来的时候，那位长着浅棕色胡须的绅士正坐在一根原木上读报纸——至少他是把报纸摊开的，只是眼睛却从报纸的上方向外瞄着。

他太有礼了，似乎因为让杰迈玛回家过夜而非常抱歉。他承诺说一定会用心照顾她的窝，直到她第二天再回来。

他说他喜欢蛋和小鸭子，看到一个这么漂亮的窝出现在他的小棚子里他会非常骄傲。杰迈玛每个下午都过来，她在窝中一共产下了九颗蛋，全都是青白色的，个头非常大。那位迷人的绅士对它们极力赞美，他总是在杰迈玛不在的时候翻动那些蛋，一遍遍地数它们的个数。

最后，杰迈玛对他说，她决定要从第二天开始孵蛋了。“我要带一口袋玉米过来，这样我就不用离开我的窝，可以一直到这些蛋都被孵化出来，不然它们会变冷的。”认真的杰迈玛说道。

“夫人，我请您不要那么麻烦地把口袋带来，我可以给您提供燕麦。但是在您开始无聊的孵蛋工作前，我想要款待您一次。咱们办一个餐会吧，就咱们两个。我能请您从农场的菜园带些香草过来吗？这样才能做出美味的煎蛋饼。鼠尾草、百里香、薄荷，再带两个洋葱和一些香芹。我能提供做填料的猪油——做煎蛋饼的猪油。”浅棕色胡须的好客绅士说。

杰迈玛头脑简单，鼠尾草、洋葱这些东西都没有引起她的怀疑。她去了农场的菜园，用嘴一点点地啃了各种香草——而这些香草正是做烤鸭时填在鸭腹中的填料。然后，她又摇摇晃晃地走进厨房，从篮子里面弄到了两个洋葱。

就在她离开厨房时牧羊犬凯普看到了她。“你拿洋葱做什么？你每天下午都一个人跑去哪里了，杰迈玛？”

杰迈玛对牧羊犬很敬畏，于是便将事情的前因后果都告诉了他。

牧羊犬听着，他聪明的脑袋便开始思考，当杰迈玛描述说那位礼貌的绅士长着浅棕色的胡须时，牧羊犬咧嘴笑了。他问了几个关于树林的问题，问清了那房子和小棚子的确切位置。然后他走出农场，跑到村子里，找到了和屠夫一起出门的两只小猎狐犬。

这可能是杰迈玛这辈子最后一次走上那条马车道了，这是一个阳光灿烂的午后，她身上背着好几把香草，包里装了两个洋葱，走起来很费劲。她飞过树林，落到了长着毛茸茸长尾巴的绅士的房子对面。

绅士正坐在原木上，嗅着空气，时不时还不安地环顾一下树林。杰迈玛降落的时候，他猛地一惊，跳了起来，说道：

“等你看完你的蛋，就来屋里。把那些煎蛋饼用的香草给我。利落点！”

他说话很无礼，杰迈玛从来都没有听他这么说过话。她很吃惊，而且很不舒服。

杰迈玛在小棚子里的时候，听到小棚子后传来了一阵脚步声。有一个长着黑鼻子的家伙透过门底下的缝嗅了嗅，然后锁上了门。杰迈玛立刻害怕起来。

过了一阵儿，传来了一些非常可怕的声音——有吼叫声，犬吠声，咆哮声，哀号声，尖叫声和呻吟声。那位长着迷人胡须的绅士不见了踪影。

不一会儿，凯普打开了小棚子的门，将杰迈玛放了出来。不幸的是，两只小狗在凯普还没来得及阻拦的时候，就冲了进来，把杰迈玛的蛋都给吃掉了。凯普的耳朵被咬伤了，两只小狗都一瘸一拐的。

杰迈玛在他们的护送下回了家，一路上都在为她的那些蛋哭个不停。六月的时候，她又生了一些蛋，这次被允许自己留着孵化，但是只有四只被孵了出来。

杰迈玛说，这全是因为她紧张。但是，其实她一直都不是个好的孵化者。





络腮胡塞缪尔的故事


从前，有一只老猫，名叫塔比莎·特迟特太太，她是个很焦虑的母亲。她经常找不到自己的小猫，而且只要他们跑丢了，就总会遇到危险。

在烘焙日那天，她决定把小猫们关进一个橱柜中。她抓住了娃娃和咪咪，却没有找到汤姆。

塔比莎太太将房子上上下下找了一个遍，喵喵地叫着汤姆的名字。她查看了楼梯下面的餐具室，又找了那间一直闲置的卧室，里面的东西全都盖着防尘罩。她上了楼梯，检查了阁楼，但就是怎么也找不到汤姆。

这是一栋很老、很老的房子，里面到处都是壁橱和走廊。有些墙壁有四英尺厚，里面经常会传出奇怪的声音，好像里面有一道小小的秘密楼梯。当然，在护墙板上的确有一些小小的、锯齿状的门洞，而且夜里经常会有东西失踪——特别是奶酪和培根。

塔比莎太太越来越焦虑，一直担心地叫着。

就在猫妈妈搜索房子的时候，娃娃和咪咪又遇到危险了。橱柜的门没有锁，所以她们推开了门，从里面出来了。她们直接走向放置在炉火前的一个发酵着的面团，那块面团被放在一个平底锅里。她们用小小的柔软的爪子拍着面团——“我们要不要做点可爱的小松饼？”咪咪对娃娃说。但就在这时，有人敲门，娃娃一惊之下跳到了面粉桶里。咪咪则跑进了奶制品室里，躲进了一个放奶锅的石头架子上的空罐子里。

来访者是他们的邻居，瑞比太太。她是过来借酵母的。

塔比莎太太从楼上下来，还在担心地喵喵叫着——“进来，瑞比表妹，进来，坐下。我遇到大麻烦了，瑞比表妹。”塔比莎太太说着流出了泪水，“我把我亲爱的儿子汤马斯[1]给弄丢了。我担心老鼠们把他抓走了。”她用围裙抹着眼泪说。

“他是只淘气的小猫，塔比莎表姐，上次我过来喝茶的时候他用我最好的帽子翻绳儿玩。你到什么地方找过他了？”

“整个房子都找了！老鼠们实在太多了！家里有这些不听话的家伙真是麻烦啊！”塔比莎·特迟特太太说。

“我倒是不怕老鼠，我来帮你找找他，然后再揍他一顿！火炉围栏里面怎么那么多煤灰？”

“烟囱需要清扫了——噢，天啊，瑞比表妹——现在娃娃和咪咪也都不见了！她们从橱柜里跑出去了。”

瑞比和塔比莎又开始把房子彻底找了个遍。她们用瑞比的伞捅到床下面一点一点地探查，翻箱倒柜地又彻底检查了一遍。她们甚至点了一根蜡烛，检查了一个阁楼中的衣箱里有什么。但是她们什么都没有找到，而就在这时，她们听到了门“砰”的一声响，像是有人跑到了楼下。

“是啊，这里的老鼠太多了。”塔比莎含着眼泪说，“我从后厨房的一个洞里抓到过七只小老鼠，上个星期六当晚饭吃掉了。还有一次，我看到了那只老鼠爸爸——那可真是一只体型巨大的老鼠啊，瑞比表妹。我刚要跳起来扑向他，他居然向我露出他的大黄牙，然后立刻缩回洞里不见了。”

“那些老鼠真是让我神经紧张啊，瑞比表妹。”塔比莎说。

瑞比和塔比莎四处找啊找啊，她们都听到了从阁楼地板下传来骨碌碌、骨碌碌的奇怪声音，但什么都找不到。

她们回到厨房。“至少找到了你的一只小猫！”瑞比说着，从面粉桶中将娃娃拽了出来。

她们使劲摇晃她，把她身上的面粉抖掉，然后将她放在厨房的地板上。她看上去像是被吓坏了。

“噢！妈妈！妈妈！”娃娃说，“厨房里面有一只很老的母老鼠！她偷了一些面团！”

瑞比和塔比莎赶紧跑去察看面团，果然，上面有小小的爪子抓过的痕迹，一大块面团不见了。

“她往哪个方向跑了，娃娃？”

但是娃娃当时太害怕了，没敢从面粉桶里向外看。

瑞比和塔比莎将她带在身边，确保在继续寻找的时候，她安全地在她们的视线之内。

她们走进了奶品室。最先找到的便是藏在空奶罐里的咪咪。她们把奶罐推倒，让她爬了出来。

“噢！妈妈！妈妈！”咪咪说，“噢！妈妈！妈妈！有一只很老的公老鼠在奶品室里——一只超级巨大的大老鼠，妈妈！他偷了一块黄油，还有擀面杖！”

瑞比和塔比莎面面相觑。

“黄油和擀面杖！唉，我可怜的儿子汤马斯啊！”塔比莎一边哭号一边绞着自己的爪子。

“擀面杖？”瑞比说，“我们在阁楼里面检查那个箱子的时候，不是听到了骨碌碌、骨碌碌的声音了吗？”

瑞比和塔比莎急匆匆跑回楼上去，能很清楚地听到那骨碌碌的声音在阁楼的地板下面响动。

“这件事情可严重了，塔比莎表姐，”瑞比说，“我们得立刻找木匠约翰过来，让他带着锯子来。”





接下来，我们来说说小猫汤姆到底遭遇了什么。看起来爬进一座老房子的烟囱里面真的很不明智，在里面很容易迷路，而且那里面有很多体型硕大的老鼠。

小猫汤姆不愿意被关在橱柜里面，所以，看到妈妈准备烘焙，他就决定躲起来。他想找一个方便又舒服的地方藏起来，最后他选定了烟囱作为他的藏身处。

火刚刚生起来，烟囱里面还不热，不过从青色的木柴上冒出了一团呛人的白烟。小猫汤姆爬过围栏，查看了一下。这是一个老式的大壁炉。

烟囱里面很宽，足够一个人站直了身子行走。所以，对于小小猫汤姆来说，空间非常充足。他直接跳进了壁炉里，在挂水壶的铁架子上稳住身子。然后汤姆又用力一跳，跳离铁架，落到烟囱里面高处的一个壁架上。他碰落了一些煤灰，正掉在火炉围栏里。

小猫汤姆被烟呛到了，咳嗽了起来，他听到木柴在下面的壁炉里噼啪作响地烧着。他决定一直向上爬，从上面的石板那儿出去，然后试着抓些麻雀。

“我不能回去了。如果我打滑，可能会掉到火里面，我漂亮的尾巴和我的蓝色小夹克都会被烧焦的！”

这烟囱是一个非常大的老式烟囱。建这个烟囱的时候，人们在炉膛里面烧的还是整块的木头呢。屋顶上烟囱露出来的部分，就如同一座小小的石塔，日光从上面照射下来，照到了防雨的倾斜石板下面。

小猫汤姆越来越害怕！他向上爬啊爬，爬啊爬。他侧着身子穿过好几寸厚的烟灰。他就像个扫烟囱的小人儿。

在黑暗里根本就分不清方向。烟道一个连着一个。现在烟少了很多，不过汤姆感觉自己迷路了。他向上爬啊爬啊，但是他没有到达烟囱的顶部，而是来到了一个地方，那里烟囱壁上的一块石头被抽掉了，里面放着一些羊骨头。

“这倒真是奇怪，”汤姆说，“谁会在烟囱里面啃骨头呢？我真希望自己从来没来过这里。这到底是什么味儿啊！好像是老鼠，只不过气味格外强烈！呛得我想打喷嚏。”

他挤进墙里的一个洞中，硬是穿过了一段非常不舒服的狭窄的通道，那里几乎没有光。他小心翼翼地向前摸索着走了几码远，来到了阁楼的护墙板后面。

黑暗中，他突然头朝下栽进了一个洞里，落到了一堆非常脏的碎布上面。汤姆重新站起来的时候，环顾四周，他发现自己是在一个从来都没有见过的地方，尽管他从出生就住在这所房子里。

这是一个非常狭小的、散发着阵阵霉味的闷热房间，里面到处都是木板、椽子、蜘蛛网、板条和墙上的灰泥。正对着他——在离他远远的地方——坐着一只硕大的老鼠。

“你浑身脏兮兮地在我的床上滚，到底打算做什么？”老鼠说，他的牙咯咯作响。

“抱歉，先生，这烟囱需要清理了。”可怜的小猫汤姆说。

“安娜·玛丽亚！安娜·玛丽亚！”老鼠喊道。随着一阵“啪嗒”“啪嗒”的声音，一只母老鼠从椽子后面探出头来。

她立刻就冲向了小猫汤姆，汤姆完全还没有反应过来是怎么回事，他的衣服就被扒下来了，他被捆成了一团，捆他的绳子被打了个很结实的死结。

捆他的就是安娜·玛丽亚。另外那只老鼠一边看着，还一边嗅着鼻烟。她将汤姆捆好后，两只老鼠就都坐在一边，张着嘴巴盯着汤姆。

“安娜·玛丽亚，”公老鼠络腮胡塞缪尔说，“安娜·玛丽亚，给我做一个小猫馅卷布丁作晚餐吧。”

“那需要面团和黄油，还得用擀面杖。”安娜·玛丽亚说，她侧着脑袋想着该如何料理小猫汤姆。

“不，”络腮胡塞缪尔说，“有什么材料就用什么做，用面包屑裹上就行，安娜·玛丽亚。”

“胡扯！必须用黄油和面团！”安娜·玛丽亚回答。

两只老鼠为此讨论了一会儿，然后便分头走了。

络腮胡塞缪尔穿过护墙板上的一个洞，壮着胆子直接顺着前面的楼梯下去，到奶品室去拿黄油。他一路什么人都没有碰上。然后他又跑了第二趟，去拿擀面杖。他用爪子推着擀面杖，就像是一个酿酒人推着啤酒桶那样。他能听到瑞比和塔比莎说话，但是她们在忙着点蜡烛检查箱子里面，谁都没有发现他。

安娜·玛丽亚顺着踢脚板下楼，从一扇百叶窗进了厨房，偷了面团。她拿了一个小碟子，用爪子抠出面团来放到碟子里。她没有看到娃娃。

汤姆被单独留在阁楼地板下，他不断挣扎，想要喵喵叫着求救。但是他的嘴里满是煤灰和蜘蛛网，被捆得非常结实，他没有办法让别人听到他求救的声音。

只有一只蜘蛛从屋顶的裂缝中爬出来，站在安全的距离外，以评判的目光审视了一下绳结。这只蜘蛛是绳结方面的权威，因为他经常把不幸的丽蝇捆起来。他并没有给汤姆提供帮助。

小猫汤姆扭动着身子挣来挣去，到最后一点儿力气都没有了。不一会儿，老鼠们回来了，开始动手把他包成布丁。他们先用黄油涂抹小猫汤姆的身体，然后将他卷进了面团里面。

“那绳子是不是很难消化啊，安娜·玛丽亚？”络腮胡塞缪尔问。

安娜·玛丽亚说她觉得那没有什么，但是她希望小猫汤姆的脑袋能够保持静止不动，因为动的话很容易弄坏面皮。她抓住了汤姆的耳朵。

小猫汤姆又是张嘴乱咬，又是吐口水，喵喵叫着扭来扭去，擀面杖骨碌碌地滚来滚去。两只老鼠分别握着擀面杖的两端。

“他的尾巴还露在外面！你拿来的面团不够用，安娜·玛丽亚。”

“我实在拿不了太多了。”安娜·玛丽亚回答。

“我不这么觉得。”络腮胡塞缪尔说。他暂停下来看了看小猫汤姆，“我不觉得这会是一个好吃的布丁，闻起来有一股煤灰味儿。”

安娜·玛丽亚正要和他争论，但就在这时，他们头上传来了别的声音——那是锯子拉来拉去的声音，还有小狗又抓又挠和兴奋地吠叫的声音。

两只老鼠丢下擀面杖，紧张地听着。

“我们被发现了，没法再做我们要做的事了，安娜·玛丽亚。咱们收拾一下咱们的财物——当然还有别人的，赶紧离开。恐怕咱们不得不留下这个布丁了。但是我相信那些绳结会很难消化，不管你怎么反对。”

“立刻过来，帮我把这些羊骨头用床单包起来，”安娜·玛丽亚说，“我还在烟囱里面放了半块熏火腿。”

因此，等到木匠约翰把板子锯开时，地板下面就只剩下擀面杖和一个被包在很脏的面皮里的小猫汤姆了。但是，那里有很强烈的老鼠的气息，接下来一整个上午，木匠约翰都在嗅来嗅去，叫个不停，他摇着尾巴，跑来跑去，不停地把头探进那个洞里面，就像个木钻一样。然后他又把板子钉好，把工具收进自己的包里，下了楼。

小猫一家已经恢复如常了。他们邀请约翰留下来吃饭。面皮已经从小猫汤姆身上剥了下来，被做成了一个大布丁，里面还塞了葡萄干，以掩盖它里面的煤烟味。他们不得不给汤姆洗了个热水澡，好把他身上的黄油洗掉。

木匠约翰闻了闻布丁的味道，很遗憾自己没有时间留下来吃饭了，他刚给波特小姐[2]做了一个独轮车，但她又预定了两个鸡窝。

傍晚，我去邮局的时候，在拐角处向那条巷子看了看，看到了逃亡中的络腮胡塞缪尔先生和他的太太，他们用一个小独轮车推着几个大包袱，那独轮车看起来很像是我的。他们正拐进农场主马铃薯家的谷仓门里。

络腮胡塞缪尔气喘吁吁的。安娜·玛丽亚依然在用尖锐的声调和他争执着。她似乎认识路，似乎有很多行李。

但我可以肯定，我从来都没有允许她借用我的独轮车。

他们进了谷仓，然后用一段绳子把包袱拖到了干草堆顶上。那之后很长一段时间，塔比莎·特迟特太太家中都没有再出现过老鼠。

而至于农场主马铃薯，他几乎被逼疯了，他的谷仓里四处都是老鼠，老鼠，老鼠！他们还吃光了鸡食，偷走了燕麦和谷糠，在面粉袋上咬出了很多洞。他们都是络腮胡塞缪尔夫妇的后代，是他们的儿子、孙子和曾孙玄孙。真是没个完了。

娃娃和咪咪长大后成了非常好的捕鼠能手。她们去村子里抓老鼠，有很多人找她们工作。她们收费很高，赚了很多钱，生活富足。她们把老鼠的尾巴在谷仓门口挂成一排，以展示她们抓了多少只老鼠——有好几十只呢！但是小猫汤姆却一直害怕大老鼠，他至多只敢面对小老鼠。

噗噗家的小兔子的故事


据说，多吃生菜会产生催眠效果。

我在吃了生菜之后可从来都没有觉得困倦过，当然，因为我并不是兔子。生菜对噗噗家的小兔子肯定有非常强的催眠效果。

小兔本杰明长大之后，和他的表姐噗噗结了婚。他们生了一大窝孩子，这一家子都没有什么远忧，日子过得非常开心。我不记得他们的孩子各自叫什么了，他们被统称为噗噗家的小兔子。

由于他们总是没有足够的食物吃，本杰明经常从噗噗的弟弟彼得那里借洋白菜——彼得有一个苗圃。有时候彼得也没有多余的洋白菜。这时候，噗噗家的小兔子们就穿过田野，到麦克格雷格先生的菜园外面的垃圾堆里去找食物，那个垃圾堆在一个阴沟里。

麦克格雷格先生的垃圾堆是个大杂烩，里面有果酱罐、纸袋子，有割草机割下来的堆成山一样的草（吃起来总是油腻腻的），一些腐烂了的西葫芦和一两只靴子。有一天——天啊，真让人开心——那里有很多长老了的生菜，那些生菜都长得太过，开花了。

噗噗家的小兔子吃生菜都吃撑了。最后，他们一个接一个地都被睡眠给征服了，全躺在了割下来的草上。

本杰明受到的影响并没有他的孩子们那么厉害。在睡着前，他还足够清醒地在头上罩了一个纸袋，以防止苍蝇骚扰。

噗噗家的小兔子们在温暖的阳光下舒服地睡着。从花园那边的草地上隐约传来了割草机隆隆的声音。丽蝇在墙头嗡嗡地飞着，一只上了年纪的小个子老鼠在果酱罐中翻找着。（我可以告诉你她的名字，她是小小鼠托玛西娜，是一只长着长长尾巴的林鼠。）她爬过本杰明头上的纸袋子，簌簌作响，吵醒了本杰明。老鼠一再表示歉意，并且说自己认识彼得。

她和本杰明就在墙边聊天，这时，他们听到一阵沉重的脚步声在头顶响起。麦克格雷格先生将一口袋割下来的草直接倒到了噗噗家的小兔子身上。本杰明缩进了他的纸袋子里，而老鼠也藏到了果酱罐里。在如雨般落下来的草中，小兔子们依然在睡梦中甜美地笑着，他们并没有醒过来，因为生菜的催眠效果太强了。他们都梦到了妈妈将他们裹进了一床干草做成的铺盖中。

麦克格雷格先生在倒空了口袋后向下面看了看，他看到从草堆中露出来的小小的棕色的耳朵尖儿。他盯着看了一会儿。就在这时，一只苍蝇落在了其中一只耳朵上，然后那只耳朵动了动。

麦克格雷格先生下来，凑到垃圾堆上。

“一，二，三，四！五！六！六只小兔子！”他说着，抓起他们并丢进了自己的口袋中。

噗噗家的小兔子们梦到了妈妈帮他们在床上翻了个身。他们动了动，但还是没有醒过来。

麦克格雷格先生把口袋扎好，然后就放在墙上，去收拾割草机了。他走了之后，兔子噗噗太太（她本来是留在家中的）穿过田地走了过来。她充满疑惑地看着那个口袋，想知道大家都去哪里了。这时，老鼠从果酱罐里面出来了，本杰明也拿下了他头上的纸袋子，他们讲述了刚才发生的悲惨的故事。

本杰明和噗噗非常绝望，因为他们都解不开扎口袋的绳子。但是小小鼠太太是一个很有办法的人，她在袋子底部的角落咬了一个洞出来。小兔子们被拽了出来，被又掐又捏地弄醒了。他们的父母把三个烂了的西葫芦、一个旧的鞋油刷子、两个烂了的萝卜放到了口袋里。然后他们躲进了一片灌木中，等待着麦克格雷格先生。

麦克格雷格先生回来后，拿起口袋便走了。从他拎着口袋的样子看，口袋似乎很重。噗噗家的兔子们在后面远远地跟着。他们看到麦克格雷格先生回到了自己的房子里。然后他们偷偷溜到窗户边偷听。

麦克格雷格先生将口袋扔到石头地板上，如果噗噗家的小兔子还在口袋里面的话，那种扔法肯定会让他们很疼的。他们听到麦克格雷格先生在石板地上拖动椅子，边走边咯咯笑。

“一，二，三，四，五，六，六只小兔子！”麦克格雷格先生说。

“呃？那是什么？他们又糟蹋什么了？”麦克格雷格太太问道。

“一，二，三，四，五，六，六只肥肥的小兔子！”麦克格雷格先生重复道，他扳着自己的指头数着，“一，二，三——”

“别傻了，你到底什么意思，你这个老糊涂？”

“在这个口袋里！一，二，三，四，五，六！”麦克格雷格先生又重复说。





（噗噗家最小的那只小兔子爬到了窗台上。）

麦克格雷格太太拎过袋子来摸了摸。她说她能够摸出来是六只，但肯定是六只老兔子，因为都很硬，而且形状都不一样。

“不适合吃，但是皮毛肯定很合适给我的旧斗篷镶边。”

“给你的旧斗篷镶边？”麦克格雷格先生大叫道，“我要卖了他们，给我自己买烟草。兔子烟草！我得剥下他们的皮，把他们的脑袋处理掉。”

麦克格雷格太太解开口袋，探手进去。她摸到了蔬菜，然后非常非常生气。她说麦克格雷格先生是“故意”的。麦克格雷格先生也非常生气。其中一个烂了的西葫芦被他从厨房的窗户丢了出来，砸到了噗噗家最小的兔子身上。真是疼死了！

本杰明和噗噗觉得他们该回家了。

所以，麦克格雷格先生没有得到烟草，麦克格雷格太太也没有得到兔皮。

但是在圣诞节时，小小鼠托玛西娜收到了一件礼物——很多的兔毛，足够她给自己做一件斗篷、一个兜帽、一个漂亮的暖手筒，还有一副暖和的连指手套。





姜和腌菜的故事


从前，在一个村子里有一家店铺，窗户上的店名是“姜和腌菜”。那是一家很小的店，大小只适合玩偶们——露辛达和厨娘简总是来这家店买食物和杂货。店里面柜台的高度对兔子们来说倒是很适合。姜和腌菜出售带红点的手帕，一便士三法寻[1]一条。他们还出售糖、鼻烟和雨靴。实际上，尽管这是一家很小的店铺，但它几乎什么都卖——除非是一些特别急需的东西——比方说鞋带、发卡和羊排。

姜和腌菜是开店的人的名字。姜是一只黄色的公猫，腌菜是一只猎犬。兔子们始终有点儿害怕腌菜。店里面也有老鼠来光顾——只是老鼠们都有点儿害怕姜。姜总是让腌菜招待老鼠，因为他说老鼠会让他流口水。

“我受不了，”他说，“我没办法看着他们带着小包袱出门去。”

“我对老鼠也有相同的感觉。”腌菜回答说，“但是我们绝对不能吃我们的顾客，不然他们会不再光顾这里，改去塔比莎·特迟特的店了。”

“不，他们谁的店都去不了了。”姜闷闷不乐地回答。

塔比莎·特迟特开着村子里的另外一家店，村子里面只有这两家店。塔比莎从来都不赊账。

姜和腌菜是允许无限制地赊账的。

赊账的意思就是：当客人买了一块肥皂，她没有拿出钱包付款，而是说下次再给钱。腌菜会深深鞠一躬，说：“当然可以，夫人。”然后便将账目记录在一个本子上。

顾客会一次又一次光顾店里，买很多东西，尽管他们还是害怕姜和腌菜。但是所谓的“钱柜”里面却一直都没有钱。

每天，顾客们都一批批地来，买很多东西，特别是太妃糖。但是总是见不到钱，哪怕只买一便士的薄荷糖，那些顾客也从来没有付过钱。但是店里的销售量巨大，是塔比莎·特迟特店的十倍。

由于总是收不到钱，姜和腌菜不得不吃自己的货物。腌菜吃饼干，姜吃鳕鱼干。他们在小店关门后，点着蜡烛吃这些东西。到了元旦的时候，他们依然没有钱，腌菜没办法去买狗证。

“真是让人难过，我很担心警察。”腌菜说。

“身为一只猎犬是你的错，我就不需要证件，牧羊犬凯普也不需要。”

“这真让人不安，我觉得自己会被法院传召。我试了去邮局赊账办理证件，可是没成功，”腌菜说，“这里四处都是警察，回家的路上我就碰上了一个。”

“咱们再给络腮胡塞缪尔寄一次账单吧，姜，他买腌肉欠了我们二十二先令九便士。”

“我相信他根本就没打算还。”姜说。

“而且我觉得安娜·玛丽亚在偷东西——那些奶油饼干都到哪儿去了？”

“你自己把它们都吃了。”姜回答。

姜和腌菜回到了后厅。他们算了算账目，加了一笔又一笔。

“络腮胡塞缪尔欠的账单有他的尾巴那么长了。自从十月份到现在，他已经买了一又四分之三盎司的鼻烟了。还用一先令三便士的价格买了七磅黄油，还有一条封蜡和四盒火柴，这该是多少？”

“给每个人都再寄一遍账单明细吧。”姜说。

过了一会儿，他们听到店铺那边传来一些响动，好像是有人从门口那里塞进来了什么。他们从后厅出来，发现柜台上有一个信封，一个警察正在笔记本上写着什么。

腌菜火冒三丈，他不停地叫啊叫啊，还跑来跑去。

“去咬他，腌菜！去咬他！”姜躲在一个糖桶后面，气急败坏地说，“他不过是个德国娃娃。”

那个警察继续在自己的本子上写着，他有两次把铅笔放进了嘴里，有一次把笔蘸进了糖浆里。

腌菜一直叫着，直到他的嗓子都哑了。但是那个警察依然没有理会。那警察有一双豆子眼，头盔是缝在头上的。终于，在最后一次跑过去看的时候，腌菜终于发现店里面没人了，那个警察不见了。不过那个信封还在那里。

“你觉得他是去叫一个真正的警察了吗？我担心那是张传票。”腌菜说。

“不是，”姜回答，他打开了信封，“是税单，需要交三英镑十九先令十一便士三法寻。”

“这是压死我们的最后一根稻草了。”腌菜说，“咱们把店关了吧。”

他们关上了门板，然后离开了。但是他们没有搬离这一片社区。实际上，有些人希望他们能够搬得远一些。

姜住在兔子洞中，我不知道他找到了什么工作，不过他看上去很强壮，日子过得很舒心。

腌菜现在是个猎场看守。

他们的店铺关门造成了很大的不便。塔比莎·特迟特立刻就把所有东西的价格提高了半个便士，她依然拒绝赊账。

当然，也有一些商人赶着马车过来——有屠夫、渔夫，还有面包商蒂莫西。但是，没有人能只依靠“芝麻发糕”、松糕和黄油小圆面包生活呀——哪怕那松糕做得像蒂莫西家做的那么美味！

过了一段日子，睡鼠约翰先生和他的女儿开始卖薄荷糖和蜡烛。但是他们没有调整蜡烛的长短，一根七英寸长的蜡烛，需要五只老鼠才能搬动。另外——他们卖的蜡烛在温暖的天气就会奇怪地起反应。睡鼠小姐拒绝回收那些投诉的顾客所带来的蜡烛头儿。

而当睡鼠约翰先生接待那些投诉的顾客时，他就躺在床上，除了说“很舒服啊”，其他的什么也不说。这可不是运营零售业的正确方法。

所以，当大家看到小母鸡萨利贴出一张印刷的海报说自己要重开那家店铺的时候，都十分开心。“母鸡家开业大促销！大酬宾大让利！超低价！快来买，快来试，快来买呀！”海报真的非常吸引人。

在开业那天，店里的人太多了。店铺里面挤满了顾客，饼干罐上站着一群一群的老鼠。小母鸡萨利手忙脚乱地给顾客找零钱，但是她坚持顾客必须付现金，不过她没什么恶意。而且，她店里有很多很多的特价商品。

在这里，每个人都能找到满意的东西。

小小鼠太太的故事


从前，有一只林鼠，名叫小小鼠太太，她住在树篱下面的一道土垄里。她的房子非常有意思。她在沙子中挖了长长的通道，通向储藏室、坚果地窖和种子地窖，这些全在树篱的根部。这房子里面还有厨房、客厅、餐具室和食品储藏室。另外，还有小小鼠太太的卧室，她睡在一张小小的箱子形状的床里。

小小鼠太太是个格外爱整洁的小老鼠，她总是打扫软软的沙子地板。

有时候，会有一只甲虫在走廊里迷路。

“走开！走开！小脏脚！”小小鼠太太会敲着她的簸箕说。

一天，一个穿着红色波点斗篷的老妇人在小小鼠太太家爬上爬下。

“你家房子着火啦，瓢虫妈妈！快点飞回家找你的孩子去吧。”

另一天，一只很大很肥的蜘蛛来到这里躲雨。

“抱歉，这难道不是玛菲小姐的家吗？”

“一边儿去，你这个胆大包天的坏蜘蛛！你把我干净整洁的房子弄得到处都是蜘蛛网！”

她把蜘蛛赶出了窗户。

蜘蛛拉了一条长长的、细细的丝，顺着丝滑下树篱。

小小鼠太太继续向前走，去一个比较偏的储藏室，取樱桃核和蓟花种子好准备饭菜。她一边走，一边不停地嗅来嗅去，眼睛盯着地板。

“我闻到了蜂蜜的味儿，是外面树篱里的樱草花吗？我敢肯定我看到的就是那些小脏脚丫留下的脚印。”

绕过一个拐角，她突然就看到了大黄蜂芭比蒂，大黄蜂正嗡嗡嗡地叫着。小小鼠太太神情严肃地看着大黄蜂，她希望自己手里能有一个扫把。

“日安，大黄蜂芭比蒂，我很乐意买些蜂蜡，不过你来这下面干什么？你为什么总是要从窗户进屋来，还不停地嗡嗡嗡叫？”小小鼠太太有些生气了。

“嗡嗡嗡！”大黄蜂芭比蒂用恼怒的尖叫声回答道。她顺着通道溜走了，躲进了一间曾用来装橡子的储藏室。

小小鼠太太在圣诞节之前就吃掉了那些橡子，储藏室现在应该是空的。但是里面全是凌乱的干苔藓。小小鼠太太拨扯着苔藓，有三四只蜜蜂探出头来，凶狠地嗡嗡叫了起来。

“我可没有让人寄宿的习惯，这是私闯民宅！”小小鼠太太说，“我要把他们赶出去——”

“嗡嗡嗡！”

“我真想知道谁能帮帮我。”

“嗡嗡嗡！”

“我不会去找杰克逊先生，他从来都不擦脚。”

小小鼠太太决定等吃过饭后再去处理那些蜜蜂。她回到客厅，听到有人在猛烈地咳嗽，坐在那里的正是杰克逊先生！他坐在一把小摇椅里，微笑着转着大拇指玩，脚搭在火炉围栏上。他住在树篱下面的一条排水沟里，那里又脏又潮。

“你好吗，杰克逊先生？天啊，你怎么这么湿呀！”

“谢谢，谢谢，谢谢，小小鼠太太！我坐一会儿把自己晾干。”杰克逊先生说。他坐在那里笑着，水从他外套的燕尾上滴落下来。小小鼠太太拿着一个墩布在他周围转来转去。

他坐了很长一段时间，小小鼠太太不得不问他是不是愿意一起吃些东西。她先给他端上了樱桃核。“谢谢，谢谢，谢谢，小小鼠太太，我没牙，没牙，没牙！”杰克逊先生说。他把嘴张得大大的，其实根本没有必要张那么大，不过，确实，他没有牙。

然后，小小鼠太太给他端来了蓟草花的种子。

“太小了，太碎了，太碎了！噗，噗，噗！”杰克逊先生说，他把蓟草花的种子吹得满屋子都是。

“谢谢，谢谢，谢谢，小小鼠太太，现在，我真的觉得——真的想要——能有一小盘子蜂蜜！”

“恐怕我没有，杰克逊先生！”小小鼠太太说。

“嘎呱呱，小小鼠太太！”杰克逊先生笑着说，“我能闻到蜂蜜的气味，所以我才来拜访的。”

杰克逊先生笨拙地从桌子边站起来，开始查看橱柜里面。小小鼠太太拿着抹布跟在他后面，把他在客厅地板上留下的大大的湿脚印擦掉。杰克逊先生确认橱柜里没有蜂蜜，便顺着过道往前走。

“说实话，说实话，你会被卡住的，杰克逊先生！”

“嘎呱呱，小小鼠太太！”

他先挤进了餐具室。

“嘎呱呱？没有蜂蜜？没有蜂蜜，小小鼠太太？”

有三只小虫子藏在餐具盘里。其中两只逃走了，最小的那只被杰克逊先生抓住了。然后，他又挤进了食品间。蝴蝶小姐正在吃糖块儿，但是她从窗户那儿飞走了。

“嘎呱呱，小小鼠太太，你似乎有很多客人啊！”

“都是不请自来的！”小小鼠太太托玛西娜说。

他们沿着沙子过道继续向前。“嘎呱——”

“嗡嗡嗡！”

他在一个拐角处遇到了大黄蜂芭比蒂，便一口将她吞了下去，但很快就吐了出来。

“我不喜欢大黄蜂，他们浑身都长满了毛。”杰克逊先生说，一边还用衣服袖子擦着自己的嘴巴。

“出去，你这个讨厌的老蛤蟆！”大黄蜂芭比蒂尖叫道。

“我要烦死了！”小小鼠太太喊道。她把自己关进了贮存坚果的地窖里。杰克逊先生把整个蜂窝给捅了，他似乎并不介意被蜜蜂蛰。

等到小小鼠太太壮着胆子出来的时候，所有人都已经走了。但是屋内却凌乱、肮脏得吓人。“我从没有见过这么乱的景象！——蜂蜜的污迹，苔藓，蓟草花——还有大大小小脏兮兮的脚印——弄得我漂亮整洁的房子四处都乱糟糟的。”小小鼠太太说。

她把苔藓和剩下的蜂蜡打扫了。然后她去找了一些小树枝回来，把大门又堵了一部分。

“我要把这门弄小些，让杰克逊先生进不来！”

她从储藏室里面拿出来了肥皂、毛巾和一个硬毛刷。但是她实在太累了，没有力气再干活了。她先是在椅子中睡着了，之后回到床上去睡了。

“我的家还能变得整洁起来吗？”可怜的小小鼠太太说。

第二天，她很早便起了床，开始大扫除，这次大扫除整整进行了两周。她扫啊，擦啊，刷啊，把所有家具都打了一遍蜡，又把她的小锡勺都擦得亮闪闪的。等到一切都变得干净、整洁、漂亮时，她举办了一个派对，邀请了另外五只小老鼠来参加，但没有邀请杰克逊先生。

杰克逊先生闻到了派对的气味，来到土龚边，却没有办法挤进门里。所以，他们从窗户将装满了蜂蜜的橡子壳一杯杯地递给他，他一点儿也没有觉得被冒犯。

杰克逊先生坐在外面，晒着太阳，说：“嘎呱呱！祝你健康，小小鼠太太！”





小脚丫蒂米的故事


从前，有一只肥肥的、生活安逸的灰色小松鼠，名叫小脚丫蒂米。他在一棵高高的树梢上有一个用树叶盖顶的窝。他还有一个妻子名叫古蒂。

小脚丫蒂米坐在外面，享受着微风，他晃动着尾巴，咯咯笑着说：“古蒂呀，坚果都成熟了，咱们必须储备一些，留着冬天和明年春天吃。”

小脚丫古蒂正忙着把苔藓塞进屋顶下面。“我们的小窝好舒服啊，我们肯定能好好睡上一整个冬天。”

“那等我们醒来的时候就会都瘦了的，而春天的时候可没有东西吃。”考虑周全的蒂莫西[1]回答。

当蒂米和古蒂来到坚果灌木丛时，发现已经有其他松鼠在那里了。

蒂米将他的夹克脱下来，挂在一根小树枝上，然后他们便开始安静地干起活来。

每天，他们都要来这里好几趟，采上很多坚果，装在袋子里运走，藏到他们搭窝的那棵树附近的几处空心树桩当中。

那些树洞都被装满之后，他们就把袋子里的坚果倒进一棵树高处的一个洞里，那个洞本来是一只啄木鸟的。坚果都骨碌碌地掉了下去。

“到时候你怎么把它们弄出来呢？这就像个存钱罐。”古蒂说。

“春天之前我就会瘦很多的，亲爱的。”小脚丫蒂米看着那个洞说。

他们收集了很多坚果——因为他们一个都没有丢。

把坚果埋在地里的松鼠都会丢掉大多半坚果，因为他们都记不住埋藏的地点。

森林里最健忘的一只松鼠叫银尾巴。他刚挖坑埋好坚果，转身就会忘记埋在了哪里。等他再挖的时候，找到的并不是属于他的坚果，于是就会发生一场战争。而其他的松鼠也都到处挖坑藏坚果，于是整个森林一片混乱。

不幸的是，在这个时候，一群小鸟正好从这里经过，他们在灌木中飞来飞去，捕食青虫和蜘蛛。那其中有好几种不同的小鸟，他们都唱着不同的歌曲。

领头的小鸟唱：“谁一直在挖我的坚果？谁一直在挖我的坚果？”

另一只小鸟唱：“一点点面包没有奶酪！一点点面包没有奶酪！”

松鼠们全都跟着他们，听他们唱的歌。第一只小鸟飞到一片灌木中，蒂米和古蒂正在那里安静地扎他们的口袋，那只小鸟唱道：“谁一直在挖我的坚果？谁一直在挖我的坚果？”

蒂米没有理会他，而是继续干自己的活。实际上，那只小鸟也没有期待能得到回答。他只是在唱他生来就会的歌而已，那歌并没有任何意义。

但其他松鼠听到这首歌，全都扑向了小脚丫蒂米，对他又抓又打，倒光了他装坚果的口袋。而引起这一切不幸的那只无辜的小鸟被吓得飞走了。

蒂米摔倒在地上，翻来滚去，最后他转身向他窝的方向逃去，一大群松鼠跟在他身后，大叫着：“谁一直在挖走我的坚果？”

他们抓住他，把他拖到了一棵树边，正是那棵上面有个小圆洞的树，他们将他推了进去。那个洞实在很小，以蒂米的身形，是进不去的，但是他们使了很大的力气，愣是将他挤了进去，这个过程中没有弄断蒂米的肋骨，真可以说是个奇迹。“我们把他留在这里，直到他忏悔为止。”松鼠银尾巴说，然后他冲着洞里吼道：“谁一直在挖我的坚果？”

小脚丫蒂米没有回答，他已经顺着树洞跌了下去，落在了一堆坚果上面，这堆坚果有一半是他贡献的。他昏了过去，安静地躺在原地，一动不动。

古蒂收拾了装坚果的口袋回到家。她泡了一杯茶，等着蒂米回来，但是蒂米没有回来，她左等右等，蒂米还是没有回来。

古蒂度过了一个孤单而不快乐的夜晚。第二天早晨，她壮着胆子回到坚果灌木林去找蒂米，但是其他不友好的松鼠把她赶走了。她在整个树林中游荡，呼喊着：

“小脚丫蒂米！小脚丫蒂米！唉，小脚丫蒂米去哪儿了？”

而就在这时，小脚丫蒂米恢复了意识。他发现自己躺在一张小小的苔藓床上，周围非常暗，他觉得浑身酸疼。这里似乎是在地下。蒂米咳嗽了几声，又呻吟了起来，因为他觉得肋骨有些疼。这时传来了一阵快活的声音，那是一只长着条纹的小花栗鼠，他手里举着一盏灯，问蒂米感觉好些了吗。他对小脚丫蒂米非常好，还把自己的睡帽借给他。这个房子里贮备的食物也很充足。

花栗鼠解释说，曾经从树顶上像下雨一样落下过一些坚果。“另外，我还找到了一些被埋起来的。”他听了蒂米的故事，放声大笑。蒂米下不了床，他劝蒂米多吃些。“但是我要是不瘦下来，怎么才能从树洞里出去呢？我妻子会担心的。”“再吃一个坚果，或是两个。我来替你把它们砸开。”花栗鼠说。于是，小脚丫蒂米越来越胖了。

现在，古蒂开始自己收集坚果。她没有再往啄木鸟洞里放过坚果，因为她一直怀疑放进去就再也拿不出来了。她把坚果藏在一棵树的树根下面，坚果全都哗啦啦地滚了下去。有一次，当古蒂倒空一个格外大的装得满满的袋子时，树根下传来了一声清晰的尖叫声。等到下一次，当古蒂再带着一满袋子坚果来的时候，有一只长着条纹的小花栗鼠从树根下匆匆忙忙地爬了出来。

“楼下已经装得满满的了，客厅里也满了，这些坚果还都顺着过道滚动，我丈夫花栗鼠哈奇已经一个人逃走了，他把我丢下了。这些坚果雨到底是怎么回事啊？”

“我郑重请求您的原谅，我不知道有人住在这里。”古蒂说，“不过，哈奇去了哪里？我丈夫小脚丫蒂米也跑了。”

“我知道哈奇在哪里，是一只小鸟告诉我的。”哈奇太太说。她领着古蒂一起去了有啄木鸟洞的那棵树，她们在洞口听了一会儿。

从下面传来了砸坚果的声音，还有一只松鼠浑厚的嗓音和一只花栗鼠尖细的嗓音在一起唱：





我的小老头儿和我吵架了，

我们到底该怎么办才好？

你有能耐你就去办，

快点走开，你这个小老头儿！





“你能从这个小圆洞里挤进去。”古蒂说。

“是的，我能，”花栗鼠说，“不过，我丈夫哈奇会咬我的。”

从下面又传来了砸坚果和啃咬东西的声音，然后是一只松鼠浑厚的嗓音和一只花栗鼠尖细的嗓音一起合唱：





日子一天天荒废过，

日子荒废过，

荒废过日子！





然后古蒂从洞口望进去，冲着下方喊道：“小脚丫蒂米！啊！天！小脚丫蒂米！”蒂米回答道：“是你吗，小脚丫古蒂？哎呀，真的是你！”他爬了上来，把头探出洞口亲吻古蒂，但是他太胖了，身子没有办法出来。

花栗鼠哈奇没有那么胖，但是他不想出来，他就待在下面，咯咯咯地笑。

就这样，一直到两周后，一场大风吹断了大树的上半截，将洞打开了，雨落了进去。然后蒂米便出来了，撑着一把伞回了家。但是花栗鼠哈奇依然在外露宿了一个星期，尽管这令人非常不舒服。

最后，一只大熊穿过树林而来，也许，他也在寻找坚果，到处地嗅来嗅去。

哈奇赶紧匆忙地回了家。哈奇回到家之后，发现自己感冒了，他感觉更不舒服了。

现在，蒂米和古蒂在他们的坚果储藏室门上加了一把小锁头。

但无论何时，只要那只小鸟看到花栗鼠夫妇，他就会唱：“谁一直在挖走我的坚果？谁一直在挖走我的坚果？”但是从来都没有得到过回答。

[1]蒂米的大名。





狐狸托德先生的故事


我曾经写过很多谦谦君子的故事，现在，我要改变一下，来写一个关于两个“讨人嫌”的故事，这两个人是老獾汤米和狐狸托德先生。

没有人会说托德先生好。兔子们都受不了他，他们在半里地外就能闻到他的气息。他喜欢游荡，长着狡猾的小胡子，没人知道他下一刻会出现在哪里。

头一天，他还住在小灌木丛里的一座树枝搭成的小房子里，让老本杰明·邦瑟一家子提心吊胆。隔一天，他就会搬到湖边一棵光秃秃的柳树里，把野鸭和水耗子吓得要命。

冬天和早春的时候，他通常会住在燕麦崖下面、公牛堤顶上岩石间的巢穴里。

他有六处房子，不过他很少待在家中。

在托德先生不在家的时候，那些房子并不总是空着的，因为有些时候老獾汤米会搬进去住。（他从来都没有征得主人同意。）

老獾汤米是个矮胖子，毛发粗硬，走路摇摇摆摆，总是咧着嘴笑，嘴咧得占了整张脸。他的习性也不好。他吃蜂窝、青蛙和虫子，总在晚上借着月光到外面闲逛，从土里挖东西。他的衣服非常脏。他在白天睡觉，还总是穿着靴子爬上床。当然，他睡的床，通常都是托德先生的。

老獾汤米的确偶尔会吃兔子肉馅饼，不过都是偶尔，吃的都是很小的兔子，而且是在其他食物实在紧缺的情况下。他对老邦瑟先生很友好，他们都不喜欢邪恶的水獭和托德先生，所以经常在一起谈论这个恼人的话题。

老邦瑟先生患病多年。他坐在洞穴外面，晒着春日的太阳，身上围着围巾，抽着装了兔子烟草的烟斗。他和他的儿子本杰明以及儿媳妇噗噗住在一起，本杰明和噗噗也有了自己的孩子。那个下午，老邦瑟先生负责看家，因为本杰明和噗噗都出去了。

小兔子宝宝们都不大，刚刚可以睁开他们的蓝眼睛，踢踢腿。他们躺在用兔毛和干草铺成的松软的床上，这床在一个浅浅的洞穴里，和大兔子洞是分开的。说实话，老邦瑟先生把他们都给忘了。

他坐在阳光下，热情地和正要穿过树林的老獾汤米聊着天，汤米带着一个口袋，拿着一个挖土用的小锄头和几个鼹鼠夹子。他伤心地抱怨找不到足够的野鸡蛋，指责托德先生把蛋都偷走了。而水獭们趁他冬眠时吃光了所有的青蛙——“我已经有半个月没有吃过像样的饭了，我现在就靠吃山胡桃度日。我最后得变成素食者，然后吃掉我自己的尾巴。”老獾汤米说。

这算不上笑话，但逗乐了老邦瑟先生，因为老獾汤米又矮又胖，总是笑嘻嘻的。所以老邦瑟先生放声大笑，硬拉着老獾汤米进屋，吃块油饼，再喝点“我儿媳妇噗噗用樱草酿的酒”。老獾汤米便欣然同意，把自己挤进了兔子洞中。

然后，老邦瑟先生又抽了一斗烟，他给了老獾汤米一个卷心菜叶子做的雪茄，这雪茄的劲儿很强，这让老汤米的笑容扯得更大了，他们吐出来的烟弥漫了整个洞穴。老邦瑟先生一边咳嗽一边放声大笑，而老獾汤米则一直吞云吐雾，咧嘴大笑。

老邦瑟先生一边笑一边咳嗽，在卷心菜烟草的烟雾中闭上了眼睛……

而等到噗噗和本杰明回来的时候，老邦瑟先生才醒过来。老獾汤米和所有的小兔子宝宝都不见了！

老邦瑟先生坚持说他没让任何人进过兔子洞。但是屋里那股獾的味道是不容否认的，而且沙地上还有圆圆的重重的脚印。他觉得很丢脸。噗噗紧绷着耳朵，扇了他几巴掌。

本杰明立刻跑去追老獾汤米。要追踪他并没有什么困难，他留下了脚印，是缓缓地沿着穿过树林的蜿蜒小路走的。在这个地方，他拔起了苔藓和酢酱草，在那个地方，又为了采野毒麦而挖了一个特别深的洞，还设了一个鼹鼠夹。一条小溪拦住了路，本杰明轻巧地跳了过去，没有弄湿脚。不过在泥里，可以很清楚地看到老獾沉重的脚印。

这条路通向那片矮灌木丛，那里的大树都已经被砍光了，只有长着叶子的橡树树桩和一大片蓝色风信子——本杰明停了下来，并不是因为花香，而是因为一股特别的气味。

托德先生的小木屋就在前方，难得的一次，托德先生正在家中。不止狐狸的气味——还有那破桶做的烟囱正冒着烟，都可以证明托德先生此刻正在家中！

本杰明直起身子，盯着这一切，他的胡子抽动着。在木屋里，有人失手掉落了一个盘子，说了些什么。本杰明跺了跺脚，就猛冲了过去。他一直跳到树林的另一边才停下来。显然老獾汤米也走了这个方向，在围墙的顶上，又出现了獾的踪迹，在石楠丛上还有拖动口袋的痕迹。

本杰明爬过围墙，进入一片草原。他又发现了一个新设的鼹鼠夹。他依然没跟丢老獾汤米。现在已经快到傍晚了。其他的兔子都从洞中出来，享受傍晚时分的空气。其中一只穿着蓝外套的兔子，正自顾自地忙着寻找蒲公英。“彼得表弟！彼得兔！彼得兔！”本杰明喊道。

穿蓝外套的兔子耳朵竖起，立直了身子，问道：

“怎么了，本杰明表哥？是有猫吗？还是鼬獾约翰？”

“不，不，不！他抢了我的孩子们！——是老獾汤米——都装在一个口袋里——你看到他了吗？”

“老獾汤米？他抢走了几个孩子，本杰明表哥？”

“七个，彼得表弟，这一窝所有的宝宝都被抢走了！他是从这条路走的吗？快告诉我！”

“是的，是的，不到十分钟之前……他说口袋里面是毛毛虫，我还在想如果真是毛毛虫的话，那里面踢蹬得就太厉害了。”

“哪条路？他走了哪条路，彼得表弟？”

“他带着口袋，里面装着活物，我看到他还设了一个鼹鼠夹。让我想想，本杰明表哥，从头到尾告诉我发生了什么。”本杰明就把事情讲了一遍。

“邦瑟姨父这么大年纪了，做事确实不够稳妥。”彼得一边想一边说，“不过现在还有两件事是比较乐观的。一是你的孩子们都活着，因为他们还在不断踢蹬，再有就是老獾汤米已经吃过点心了，他可能会去睡觉，然后留着小兔子们当早餐。”

“他走了哪条路？”

“本杰明表哥，镇定，我很清楚他走了哪条路。因为托德先生在小木屋那边，所以，汤米必定是去了托德先生的另一处房子，那处房子在公牛堤坝的顶上。我会知道这些，是因为他主动问我是否需要给棉花尾巴姐姐带信，他说他要经过棉花尾巴家。”（棉花尾巴嫁给了一只黑兔子，现在住在山上。）

彼得收起自己的蒲公英，陪着这个痛苦焦虑的父亲出发了。他们穿过了好几片田地，开始爬山。老獾汤米的踪迹非常明显。他似乎每隔十几码远就把口袋放下休息一下。

“他肯定累得喘不过气来了，我们离他很近了，从气味上就能判断得出来。真是个脏鬼！”彼得说。

阳光依然和煦温暖，斜斜地照射在山坡的草地上。半路上，他们看到棉花尾巴坐在自家门口，有四五只半大的小兔子在她身边玩耍，其中一只是黑色的，其他的都是棕色的。

棉花尾巴曾看到老獾汤米从远处经过。他们问她她丈夫是否在家，她却答非所问地说她看到老獾汤米休息了两次，并且老獾汤米还点了点头，指着口袋，似乎笑得直不起身子来。

“快点，彼得，老獾会把我的宝宝们煮了的，得再快点！”本杰明说。

他们继续向上爬啊爬啊。“他刚才肯定在家，我看到他的黑耳朵从洞中探了出来。”

“他们住得离公牛堤坝的岩石那儿太近了，没法和邻居吵架。走吧，本杰明表哥。”

当他们靠近公牛堤坝顶上的树林时，便开始蹑手蹑脚地走着。岩石间的树木长得十分茂盛，而就在那里，在那个石崖下面，托德先生在那里安了一个家。那正好在陡峭的堤坝顶上，石头和灌木把那里遮掩了起来。两只兔子小心翼翼地向上爬去，静静地听着，仔细地看着。

那处房子是个笼子、监狱和倒塌的猪圈的结合体。房子有一扇很结实的门，关得很严并且还紧紧地锁着。落日将窗框照得如同红色的火焰一般，但是厨房里的炉子并没有点着火，兔子们从窗户向里望的时候能够看到炉子里面堆着干柴火。

本杰明如释重负地呼了口气。不过厨房桌子上准备的东西让他又是一惊。桌上放着一个空的蓝色柳叶花纹的大馅饼盘子，旁边还摆着一把大号的切肉刀和叉子，另外还有一把斧子。

在桌子的另一边，半折起的桌布上放着一个盘子、一个平底杯、一套刀叉、盐罐和芥末，桌边还有一把椅子——也就是说，这是一个人享用晚餐的准备。

他们没有看见人，也没有看见小兔子们。厨房里面空荡荡的，很安静，时钟嘀嘀嗒嗒地走着。彼得和本杰明把鼻子抵在窗户上，透过暮色向里望着。然后他们绕过岩石，爬到了房子的另一边，那里湿漉漉的，有一股怪味儿，长满了荆棘和石楠。两只兔子吓得直发抖。

“我可怜的小兔子宝宝啊！真是个可怕的地方！我再也见不到他们了！”本杰明叹着气说。

他们爬到了卧室窗户前。这里也像厨房的窗户一样关着，并上了闩。但是有迹象表明这个窗户最近被打开过。蜘蛛网被破坏了，窗台上有刚留下的脏脚印。

屋里面一片漆黑，一开始他们什么都看不见，不过他们听到了一个声音——是低沉而有规律的鼾声。他们的眼睛慢慢适应了黑暗，辨认出有个身影睡在托德先生的床上，正蜷着身子缩在毯子下面。“他穿着靴子就爬到床上去了。”彼得轻声说。本杰明非常紧张，拉着彼得赶快离开了窗台。

老獾汤米的呼噜声依然在继续，从托德先生的床上有规律地传出来。他们完全看不到小兔子们在哪里。

太阳已经下山了，树林中有一只猫头鹰开始叫唤。许多让人不喜欢的东西散落在周围，这些东西本该被埋起来的，比如兔子骨头、颅骨和鸡腿，还有其他吓人的东西。这是一个恐怖的地方，而且非常黑。

他们又回到了房子前面，尝试了各种办法，想要打开厨房窗户的窗闩；想要撬开窗扇上一颗生锈的钉子，但是没有用，特别是现在一点儿光都没有。他们肩并肩坐在窗户外面，低声说着话，静静地听着。

半个小时后，月亮升到了树林上空。清冷明亮的月光照着岩石中的这座房子，照着厨房的窗户。但是，哎呀，还是一只小兔子宝宝都看不到！

月光照射在切肉刀和馅饼盘子上，闪烁着，在肮脏的地板上投射出一道亮光。借着月光，可以看到在厨房壁炉旁边的墙上有一道小铁门——一道老式的、烧柴的砖炉烤箱的门。很快，彼得和本杰明几乎同时注意到，只要他们摇动窗户，对面的那扇小门就也会摇动着回应他们。小兔子们还活着，就被关在烤箱里！

本杰明激动万分，幸好老獾汤米没被吵醒。汤米低沉的呼噜声依然从托德先生的床上传来。不过，这个发现并没有令人多么安心。他们依然打不开窗户，尽管小兔子们还活着，但是根本没有能力自救，他们都还很小，还不会爬呢。

小声商量了一阵儿后，彼得和本杰明决定挖一条地道。他们在堤坝下面一两码的地方开始挖，希望可以从岩石间挖出一条地道，通向屋内。厨房的地板太脏了，看不出来它到底是土的还是石头的。

他们挖啊挖啊，挖了好几个钟头。由于有石头，他们没有办法挖直路，但是在长夜将尽的时候，他们终于挖到了厨房地板下面。本杰明躺在地道里，仰着身子挖着。彼得的爪子已经被磨坏了，他在地道外面，负责把挖出来的沙子运走。他喊道：“天亮了——太阳升起来了！”下面树林中的松鸦开始叽叽喳喳。

本杰明从黑暗的地道中出来，摇晃掉耳朵里的沙子，用爪子抹了抹脸。每过一分钟，阳光都令山顶上暖和一点儿。山谷里是一片白色迷雾的海洋，还能看见被阳光染成金色的树梢。

从迷雾中的田野里又传来了一声松鸦愤怒的叫声——然后是一声狐狸尖锐的号叫！

两只兔子彻底慌了神。他们做了平生最蠢的事情，他们匆匆忙忙地躲进了新挖出来的小地道里，藏到了最里面，那里就在托德先生厨房的地板下方。

托德先生正在向公牛堤坝上爬，他此刻的心情糟透了。最初，他因为打碎了盘子而恼怒。这全是他自己的错，那是一个瓷盘子，是他祖母雌狐威克森·托德留下来的最后一件餐具了。而后，令人讨厌的蚊子弄得他烦上加烦。他又没能成功地在一只母野鸡的窝里抓住她，只在野鸡窝里找到了五颗蛋，其中两个还臭了。托德先生这一整夜过得可真不舒心。

像往常一样，当心情不好的时候，他就决定搬家。一开始，他搬去了秃柳树那里的住处，但是那里太潮湿了，水獭还在附近留下了一条死鱼。托德先生不喜欢任何人留下的东西，除了他自己的。于是他就上山来了，看到老獾留下的不容错认的痕迹，他的心情更差了。除了老獾汤米没有人会把苔藓挖得乱七八糟。

托德先生用他的手杖抽打着地面，真是火冒三丈，他能猜到老獾汤米去了哪里。更令他生气的是，有只松鸦一直跟着他，那只松鸦从一棵树飞到另一棵树，不停地厉声叫着，警告能听到这叫声的所有兔子：有猫或是狐狸正往树林里走。有一次，他从托德先生的头顶一边叫着一边飞过，托德先生向他厉声斥骂，并大声吼叫起来。

托德先生小心翼翼地靠近了他的房子，拿着一把生锈的大钥匙。他嗅来嗅去，胡须不停地抽动。房子上着锁，不过托德先生还是怀疑里面有人。他把生锈的钥匙插入锁孔转动着，藏在地下的两只兔子听得清清楚楚。托德先生轻手轻脚地打开门，走了进去。

自己厨房中的景象令托德先生怒不可遏。厨房里，托德先生的椅子，他的馅饼盘子，他的刀叉，他的芥末和盐罐，还有他本来叠起来放在橱柜里面的桌布——现在全都摆在外面，准备晚餐用（也可能是早餐）——想都不用想，这一切都是讨厌的老獾汤米干的。

很幸运，屋里面有新鲜泥土的味道和肮脏的老獾的味道，盖住了兔子的气息。而吸引托德先生注意力的是一种声音——一串低沉、缓慢而有规律的呼噜声，是从他的床上传来的。

他透过半开着的卧室门的缝隙向里看去，然后他转身匆匆忙忙地跑到了房子外面。他的胡子都翘了起来，脖子上的毛也都竖了起来，真是愤怒到了极点。

接下来的二十分钟里，托德先生不断地悄悄潜进屋内，然后又匆匆地退出来。最后，他终于大胆地向前——直接进了卧室。当他在房子外面时，会气得直刨地。但当他进到屋里后，他又实在不愿意看老獾汤米的那副牙。汤米平躺着，他的嘴张着，咧得大大的，几乎咧到了耳朵了。他很平静、很有规律地打着呼噜，但是他的一只眼睛并没有完全闭紧。

托德先生从卧室进进出出。有两次，他进去的时候带着他的拐杖，还有一次，他拿了煤斗，但是他想了想之后，又拿着出去了。等他放下煤斗再回来的时候，老獾汤米躺得更靠床边了，但是他似乎睡得更香甜了。他是一个懒到不可救药的人，另外，他一点儿都不害怕托德先生，他就是太懒了，躺得太舒服了，不愿意动一下。

托德先生这一次拿着一根晾衣绳回到了卧室。他站在那里打量着老獾汤米，凝神听着他打呼噜的声音，足有一分钟之久。那呼噜声确实非常大，但也似乎很正常。

托德转身背对着床，去开窗户。窗户吱嘎作响，他吓了一跳，赶紧转身看。老獾汤米刚刚睁开一只眼睛，又匆忙地闭上了。呼噜声依然在继续。

托德先生的行为非常古怪，也格外不安。因为床位于卧室的门和窗户之间。他把窗户打开了一点儿，然后把晾衣绳的大部分都放到了外面的窗台上。留在里面的绳子末梢上有一个钩子，被握在他手中。

老獾汤米依然在尽责地打着呼噜。托德先生站着看了他一会儿，然后又离开了屋子。老獾汤米睁开双眼，看着绳子，咧嘴笑了。窗户外面传来一阵响动。老獾汤米又赶紧闭上了眼睛。

托德先生出了前门，绕到了房子后面。路上，他在兔子们挖出来的洞那儿绊了一下。如果他知道是谁躲在洞中的话，肯定会立刻把他们拉出来的。托德先生的脚陷到了地道里，几乎就踩到了彼得和本杰明的头上，但幸运的是，他以为这洞是老獾汤米挖的。他拿起窗台上的那卷绳子，仔细听了一阵儿，然后把绳子绑到了树上。

老獾汤米用一只眼睛透过窗户看着托德先生。他有点儿迷糊了。

托德先生从山泉那里打了满满一大桶水，提着沉重的水桶，他摇摇晃晃地穿过厨房，进入卧室。

老獾汤米依然在很用心地打着呼噜，甚至还发出了哼哼声。

托德先生把水桶放在床边，拿起带着钩子的那端绳子，犹豫了一下，他看了看老獾汤米。那呼噜声就像是要中风了似的，不过他的嘴咧得没有那么大了。

托德先生小心翼翼地爬上了一把放在床头架边上的椅子。他的腿离老獾汤米的牙齿格外近，真的非常危险。他伸长手，把绳子带钩子的那端穿过大床的帐顶，那里本该是挂床帐用的。

由于房子没有人住，托德先生的床帐被叠好收了起来，床单也收了起来。老獾汤米身上只盖着一条毯子。托德先生站在晃晃荡荡的椅子上，仔细地端详着汤米，他睡得太沉了，要是有睡觉比赛的话，他肯定会得第一名。似乎，没有什么事情能把他吵醒，哪怕是在床上方飞荡的绳子。

托德先生安全地从椅子上面下来，又拎着那桶水想要再爬到椅子上去。他打算把水桶挂在钩子上，悬在老獾汤米的头上方，给汤米洗个冷水澡，他从窗外拉动绳子就可以做到。

尽管托德先生心怀恶意，尽管他长着浅棕色的胡须，但是作为一个腿很细的人，要把那么重的东西举到钩子的高度，他的力气真的不够。他几乎没有办法站稳身子。

呼噜声越来越激烈了，老獾汤米的一条腿在毯子下面动了动，不过他依然保持着平静的睡姿。

托德先生拎着桶从椅子上安全地下来了，考虑了一会儿后，他把桶里的水倒到了一个洗脸盆里和一个水罐里，空桶就没有那么重了，他可以拎得动。他把空水桶吊挂在了老獾汤米的头上方。

肯定从来都没有睡得这么沉的人！托德先生在椅子上不停地上上下下，下下上上。由于没有办法一次性把整桶水举高，他就去取了一个牛奶罐来，一点一点地把水往空水桶里面舀。水桶越来越满，像个钟摆一样摇来摇去。有时候，会有水滴溅落下来，不过老獾汤米的鼾声依然很有规律，他一动也未动过——除了一只眼睛。

最后，托德先生的准备工作终于完成了。水桶里面装满了水，绳子在床的上方绷得紧紧的，绳子的另一端穿过窗台，系在外面的树上。

“这会把我的卧室搞得一团糟，不过不这样大清扫一次，我就再也不会在这张床上睡觉了。”

托德先生最后又看了老獾汤米一眼，然后轻手轻脚地离开了卧室。他走到房子外面，关上前门。两只兔子听到他的脚步声就在地道上面响过。他跑到房子后面，想要解开绳子，把满桶的水洒到老獾汤米的身上。

“我要用个惊喜来叫醒他，只是他不会愉快的。”托德先生说。

托德先生刚一走，老獾汤米便赶紧从床上爬起来。他把托德先生的睡衣卷成一团，放在床上，就在水桶的下方，来代替他自己，然后他也离开了房间——嘴咧得大大的，大到了极限。老獾汤米走进厨房，生火烧上水，这个时候，他并没有费心去烹煮那些小兔子。

托德先生到了树边的时候，发现水桶的重量带来的拉力把绳结拽得死死的，已经解不开了。他不得不用牙齿啃绳子，他啃了二十多分钟，最后绳子猛地一抽，溜了出去，差点儿把他的牙齿拉掉，让他狠狠地向后摔了过去。

房子里面传来一声很大的响声，还有水哗啦啦喷溅的声音，还有水桶骨碌碌滚动的声音。不过没有惊叫声。托德先生很疑惑，他静静地坐着，全神贯注地听着，然后他透过窗户向里面望。水从床上滴滴答答地往下流，水桶已经滚到了房间的一个角落。

而就在床的中间，在毯子下面，有一个湿漉漉的被压平了的东西——就在中间，桶掉下来的地方，陷得格外深一些，似乎是把肚子砸穿了。那个东西的头被盖在湿毯子下面，呼噜声已经没有了。除了水从床垫往下滴落的“滴答”“滴答”声以外，没有任何声音。

托德先生看了半个小时，他的眼睛闪闪发光。然后他欢跳雀跃，甚至大胆地敲着窗户，不过床上的那个东西一点儿都没有动。

是的——毫无疑问——结果比他计划的还要好，桶砸到了可怜的老獾汤米，把他给砸死了。

“我要把这个讨厌的老家伙埋在他自己挖的洞里。我要把我的被褥都搬出来，放到太阳下面晒。”托德先生说，“我要洗桌布，并把它铺在草地上、在太阳底下晒白。必须把那毯子挂出来吹吹风，床上肯定需要彻底消毒，然后用长柄炭炉烘干，再用热水瓶加热。我要用到软肥皂，猴子肥皂，还有各式各样的肥皂，还有碱水和硬毛刷，还有杀虫粉，还有碳粉来去味儿。我必须得进行一次彻底消毒。也许我得烧些硫磺粉。”

托德先生匆匆地绕过房子，想去厨房拿一把铲子。“首先，我得把这个洞给弄好了，然后把毯子里的那个人给拖出来……”

他打开了门……

老獾汤米正坐在托德先生的餐桌边，从托德先生的茶壶里往托德先生的杯子中倒茶。他身上非常干爽，而且在咧着嘴笑。他把一杯滚烫的茶泼向了托德先生。

然后托德先生扑向了老獾汤米，老獾汤米在碎瓷片中和托德先生扭打了起来，一场恐怖的大战在厨房爆发。对于躲在地下的两只兔子来说，每一次家具倒下的声音，听起来都像是地板要塌下来一样。他们悄悄地从地道里爬出来，在岩石和灌木丛中徘徊，不安地听着动静。

屋子里面一片喧嚣，十分吓人。在烤箱中的小兔子宝宝们被吵醒了，全都吓得浑身发抖，也许应该庆幸他们还被关在烤箱里面。

厨房里面的一切都被打翻了，只有餐桌还是立着的。除了壁炉台和防火栅栏，所有东西都被打破了。瓶瓶罐罐全都被摔得粉碎。椅子坏了，窗玻璃、钟表都摔碎了，地上还有几缕托德先生的浅棕色胡须。花瓶从壁炉台上滚了下来，罐子从架子上掉了下来，水壶从壶架上翻了下来。老獾汤米一脚踩进了一罐子木莓果酱里。水壶里滚开的水洒到了托德先生的尾巴上。

水壶落下的时候，一直咧着嘴笑的老獾汤米刚好占了上风，他像滚一根圆木一样，把托德先生从门口滚了出去。吼叫和撕咬转战到了门外，他们滚过堤坝，滚下山，在岩石间撞来撞去。老獾汤米和托德先生之间再没有任何情义可言。

河滩边一平静下来，彼得和本杰明就立刻从灌木丛中出来了。

“抓紧时间！跑进去，本杰明表哥！跑进去把小兔子们救出来，我在门口把风！”

但是本杰明被吓坏了。

“哎呀，哎呀，他们很快就会回来的！”

“不，他们不会的。”

“他们会的！”

“真是自己吓唬自己！我觉得他们肯定摔到下面的采石场去了。”

本杰明依然在犹豫，彼得不得不一直用力推着他。

“快点儿，没事儿的。记得出来时把烤箱门关上，本杰明表哥，这样他就不会想起他们了。”

很显然，托德先生的厨房里还有活物。





此时的兔子洞中，气氛却让人不太舒服。

噗噗和老邦瑟先生在晚餐的时候又吵了起来，各自都度过了一个无眠的夜晚，在早饭的时候争吵再度爆发。老邦瑟先生无法再否认他邀请了朋友进过兔子洞，但是他拒绝回应噗噗的质问和责备。那天过得很沉重。

老邦瑟先生闷闷不乐，缩在一个角落里，将一把椅子挡在自己身前。噗噗拿走了他的烟斗，藏起了他的烟草。她进行了一次彻底的大扫除，以缓解自己的情绪。她刚刚把一切做完，躲在椅子后面的老邦瑟先生就不安地猜想她接下来会做些什么。

托德先生的厨房里，现在是一片废墟了，本杰明穿过一片浓重的尘埃，紧张地走向烤箱。他打开烤箱门，手探进去摸索，发现里面有暖暖的扭来扭去的东西。他小心翼翼地提出来，然后去和彼得会合。

“我找到他们了！我们能走了吗？还是我们要先躲起来，彼得表弟？”

彼得支棱起耳朵，远处扭打的声音依然在树林中回响。

五分钟后，两只上气不接下气的兔子从公牛堤坝上飞奔下来，他们俩合力半拖半拉地拽着一个口袋，跌跌撞撞地穿过草地，最后终于安全到了家，冲进了兔子洞中。

当彼得和本杰明带着小兔子们回来时，老邦瑟先生如释重负，噗噗也欣喜若狂。小兔子们被折腾得很厉害，而且也饿了，他们被喂过食物，然后安顿上床睡觉。没多久，他们就康复了。

一个长长的新烟斗和一份新鲜的兔子烟草被送到老邦瑟先生面前，虽然他自尊心很强，还在计较面子，不过还是接受了。

老邦瑟先生得到了原谅，全家人一起吃饭。彼得和本杰明把他们的经历告诉了大家——不过他们停留的时间不够长，没有办法说出老獾汤米和托德先生之间的战斗到底是什么结果。





小猪平平的故事


从前，有一只上了年纪的母猪，叫作蹄子阿姨，她家里有八个孩子，其中有四只小母猪，分别是暴脾气、吸吸、笑笑和点点，另外四只小公猪，分别是亚历山大、平平、下巴颏和秃尾巴。秃尾巴的尾巴曾经发生过一些事故。

这八只小猪的胃口都很好。“哟哟哟，他们吃啊吃，他们真的是吃个不停！”蹄子阿姨骄傲地看着她的孩子们。这时突然传来了一阵恐怖的尖叫声，亚历山大钻进了猪食槽的铁环里，被卡在那里了。蹄子阿姨和我抓着他的后腿才把他拉了出来。

下巴颏总是做丢脸的事情，洗衣日那天，他吃掉了一块肥皂。不一会儿，我们在一篮子干净的衣服中，发现了另一只脏兮兮的小猪。“哟哟哟！这到底是哪个呀？”蹄子阿姨嘟囔道。

整个家里的小猪都是粉色的，或是粉色带黑色斑点的，但这只小猪全身都是黑乎乎的，等把这只小猪放进浴桶里洗过后发现，这是笑笑。

我走进了菜园，发现暴脾气和吸吸把胡萝卜都拔出来了，我打了她们一顿，拎着她们的耳朵把她们揪出了菜园。暴脾气还想咬我。

“蹄子阿姨，蹄子阿姨！你是个值得尊敬的人，可是你的孩子却没有良好的教养。他们每个都调皮捣蛋，只有点点和平平还不错。”

“是啊，是啊。”蹄子阿姨叹了口气，“而且他们喝了好多桶牛奶，我不得不再养一头奶牛才行！乖乖的小点点要留在家做家务，其他的都必须离开。四只小公猪和四只小母猪如果都凑在一起，实在太多了。是啊，是啊，是啊，”蹄子阿姨说，“如果没有他们，食物就会很充足了。”

所以下巴颏和吸吸坐在一辆独轮车里离开了，秃尾巴、笑笑和暴脾气乘着一辆马车走了。

剩下的两只小公猪，平平和亚历山大，要去集市了。我们刷了他们的皮毛，把他们的尾巴绕得更卷翘一些，洗干净他们的小脸，在院子中和他们道别。

蹄子阿姨用一块很大的手帕擦着眼泪，然后她擦了擦小猪平平的鼻涕，又流下了眼泪；接着她又擦了擦亚历山大的鼻涕，眼泪又流下来了。然后她把手帕递给了点点。蹄子阿姨叹了一口气，咕噜着，对小猪们说出了下面的话：

“小猪平平，我的儿子小猪平平，你必须要去集市。牵着你的弟弟亚历山大的手。注意别弄脏你礼拜天的好衣服，记得擦鼻涕——”蹄子阿姨又把手绢递给他们俩，“小心陷阱，小心鸡窝，小心咸肉和鸡蛋，要一直用你的后腿走路。”小猪平平是一只安静的小猪，他神情肃穆地看着自己的母亲，一滴眼泪从他的脸颊上滑落。

蹄子阿姨开始对另一个儿子说话：“我的儿子亚历山大，拉着——”

“喂，喂，喂！”亚历山大咯咯笑了起来。

“拉着你的哥哥平平的手，你必须去集市。注意——”

“喂，喂，喂！”亚历山大又打断了妈妈的话。

“你没好好听我说话！”蹄子阿姨说，“注意看路标和里程碑，不要吃到鲱鱼刺——”

“另外记住，”我强调，“你们只要过了村子的分界线，就回不来了。亚历山大，你没有认真听。这里有两张允许两只猪去往兰开夏集市的许可证。听着，亚历山大。我去警察局弄这些证件可并不容易，我可不想再去一次。”小猪平平严肃地听着，而亚历山大则不可救药地跑着神。

为了保险，我把证件用别针别在了他们的马甲口袋里。蹄子阿姨给每只小猪一个小包袱，八颗薄荷糖，以及写在一卷纸上的行为规范。然后，他们便出发了。

小猪平平和亚历山大快步前进，走了一英里远，至少平平走了一英里。亚历山大有半里路都是不停地从路一边跳到另一边。他手舞足蹈，不停地捏他的哥哥，还唱着歌：





这只小猪去集市，

这只小猪家中留，

这只小猪吃肉肉——





“看看他们给咱们准备了什么饭，平平？”

平平和亚历山大坐在地上，解开了包袱。亚历山大立刻就把自己的饭狼吞虎咽地吃完了。他还吃光了他的薄荷糖。“给我一颗糖吧，求求你了，平平。”

“但我想留着在紧急情况时用。”平平迟疑地说。亚历山大尖声笑了起来，然后他用固定他许可证的别针刺平平，平平挥手打他时，他把别针弄掉了，就想要抢平平的别针，两份证件混在了一起。平平训斥了亚历山大。

不过，不一会儿，他们就和好了，又一起小跑着向前走。他们边走边唱：





汤姆，汤姆，吹笛人的儿子，

他偷了一只猪，然后跑掉了！

但是他会吹的调子只有一首，

《在山的那边遥远的地方》！





“说什么？年轻的先生们？偷了一只猪？你们的许可证呢？”警察说。在一个拐弯的地方他们差一点儿就撞到他身上。平平拿出了自己的证件，亚历山大摸索了一阵后，递出了一个皱巴巴的东西——

“两盎司半糖果，花费三法寻。——这是什么？这可不是许可证。”亚历山大的脸垮了下来，他把许可证给弄丢了。“我有一份许可证的，我真有的，警察先生。”

“看上去你出门的时候他们的确是让你带了。我要经过农场。你可以跟着我走。”

“我也能回去吗？”平平问。

“我觉得你没必要，年轻的先生。你的许可证没问题。”

平平并不愿意独自上路，而且天也开始下雨了。但是和警察争执并不明智，他给了弟弟一颗薄荷糖，目送他走出了自己的视线。

简单介绍下亚历山大的经历——警察大约在下午茶的时候悠闲地走进了我们的房子，后面跟着一只湿漉漉、沮丧的小猪。我把亚历山大处理给了邻居，他安顿下来之后过得很好。

平平垂头丧气地独自前行，他走到十字路口，看到了一个路标——“去集市镇五英里；翻山四英里；去蹄子农场三英里。”

平平很吃惊，今天晚上到达集市镇的希望微乎其微，而明天就是雇佣集市了。一想到亚历山大的玩闹浪费了多少时间，他的心情就更糟了。他惆怅地望了望通往山里的那条路，然后便乖乖地走上了另一条路。他扣紧了外套，以抵御雨水。他从来都不想去，一想到自己独自站在一个拥挤的集市中，被别人审视，推搡，被某个陌生的大个子农夫雇走，他真的非常难过。

“我希望自己能有个小菜园，种些土豆。”平平说。他把凉凉的手插入口袋，摸到了自己的许可证，他把另一只手放入了另一个口袋，摸到了另一张许可证——那是亚历山大的！平平尖叫了起来，然后疯狂地往回跑，希望能追上亚历山大和警察。但是他拐错了一个弯，又拐错了好几个弯，最后彻底迷路了。

天越来越黑，风在低吟，树枝摇曳，吱嘎作响。

平平越来越害怕，哭了起来。“喂，喂，喂，我找不到回家的路了！”经过一个小时的游荡后，他终于离开了森林，月光穿过云层照射了下来，一个从没有见过的村子出现在平平眼前。一条路穿过一片荒原，下面是一条宽阔的山谷，有一条小河在月光下闪烁着波光，而在远处——朦胧的远方——是群山。

他看到一座小木屋，便走了过去，偷偷摸摸地进了屋。“我很担心这里是个鸡窝，不过我还能怎么办呢？”平平说，他浑身湿漉漉的，很冷，而且实在累坏了。

“咸肉和鸡蛋，咸肉和鸡蛋！”一只母鸡在栖息处上叫道。

“陷阱！陷阱！陷阱！咯咯！咯咯！咯咯！”被打扰到的公鸡斥责道。“去集市！去集市！咯咯叽！”他旁边一只正在抱窝的白母鸡叫道。小猪平平被吓坏了，决定天一亮就离开。渐渐地，他和母鸡们都睡着了。

不到一个小时，他们都被吵醒了。鸡窝的主人彼得·汤马斯·派伯森先生提着一盏灯和一个大筐子，准备抓六只鸡，第二天早晨带去集市上卖。他抓住了公鸡旁边的白母鸡，然后他的眼睛落到了缩在角落里的平平身上。他说了一句莫名其妙的话：“哈，这又是一只！”他抓住了平平的脖子，把他丢进了筐子里。然后他又抓住了五只脏兮兮的不停踢蹬乱叫的母鸡，丢到了平平的身上。

筐子里面装了六只鸡和一只小猪，分量可不轻。筐子被带着下山，一路颠簸。尽管快被那些小母鸡抓成碎片了，小猪平平尽量想办法把他的证件和薄荷糖都藏到了衣服里面。

最后，筐子终于被重重地放在了一间厨房的地板上，盖子被掀开来，小猪被抓了出来。他抬头看去，眨着眼睛，看到了一个丑得出奇的老头儿，正咧着大嘴笑。

“反正这只是自己送上门来的。”派伯森先生说着，把小猪的口袋翻了个底朝天。他把筐子推到角落里，扔了一个口袋盖在上面，以便让母鸡们保持安静，然后在炉火上放了一个水壶，接着便解开了他的靴子。

小猪平平拉过一张铜凳子，坐在边缘上，害羞地烤着自己的手。派伯森先生脱下靴子，扔到了厨房另一边的护墙板上。这时传来了一个压抑的声音。“闭嘴！”派伯森先生说。平平烤着手，看着他。

派伯森先生拽下另一只靴子，也像第一只那样扔了出去。又传来一声奇怪的声音。“安静，好不好？”派伯森先生说。平平坐在铜凳的最边缘处。

派伯森先生从一个箱子里拿出了玉米粉，又做了一些粥。平平觉得，就在厨房的另一端，有什么东西正强忍着对这些食物的兴趣，但是他太饿了，没有精力去想那些声音的事儿了。

派伯森先生将三个盘子倒得满满的，他自己一份，平平一份，第三盘——瞪了平平一眼之后——拿走了，还锁了起来。小猪平平战战兢兢地吃光了他的饭。

饭后，派伯森先生查了查日历，摸了摸小猪平平的肋骨，现在这个季节腌咸肉的话已经太晚了，他很舍不得自己的玉米粉。另外，那些母鸡已经看到这只小猪了。他看着自己剩下的熏猪肋肉不多了，然后又迟疑不决地看着小猪。“你可以睡在小地毯上。”彼得·汤马斯·派伯森先生说。

小猪平平睡得很香。早晨，派伯森先生又做了些粥。天气比昨天暖和多了。他看了看箱子里剩下的玉米粉，明显很不满意。“你还会继续走吗？”他问平平。

还没等平平回答，一个邻居在大门口处吹口哨——派伯森先生要带着母鸡搭他的车。派伯森先生匆匆忙忙提起筐子，命令小猪在他走后关上门，不该动的不要动。不然，“我回来就扒了你的皮！”派伯森先生说。

平平突然灵机一动，如果他也请求搭车，也许他也能够及时到达集市。但是他不相信彼得·汤马斯。

慢悠悠地吃过早饭后，小猪平平四处查看了一下小屋。所有东西都被锁起来了。他看到厨房后面的一个桶里面有一些土豆皮。平平吃掉了土豆皮，在桶里洗了盛粥用的盘子。他一边干活一边唱歌：





汤姆用他的笛子吹出了声音，

引来了所有的男孩和女孩，

他们全都跑来听他演奏

《在山的那边遥远的地方》！





突然间，有一个小小的、压抑的声音加入了进来：





在山的那边很远很远的地方，

风会把我的头饰给吹跑！





小猪平平放下正在擦着的盘子，仔细听着。

过了好长一会儿，小猪平平踮着脚尖走过去，站在门口朝厨房的前面偷偷地看，那里什么人都没有。

又过了一会儿，小猪平平走到被锁着的橱柜门那里，嗅了嗅锁孔。这里也格外安静。

又过了一会儿，小猪平平把一块薄荷糖从门下面的缝隙中推了过去。糖很快就消失了。

那天，小猪平平把剩下的六块糖都塞了过去。

等到派伯森先生回来的时候，他看到小猪坐在炉火前，小猪平平刷了灶台，还在炉子上烧了壶水，只是平平拿不到玉米粉，所以做不了饭。

派伯森先生很友善，他拍了拍小猪的后背，做了很多粥，但忘了锁上装玉米粉的箱子。他的确给橱柜的门上了锁，但是却没有把门关严。他早早地就上床睡觉了，告诉小猪平平不管什么原因第二天也不要在十二点之前叫醒他。

小猪平平坐在炉火边，吃着自己的晚餐。就在这时，就在他的胳膊肘边，一个小小的声音说：“我的名字叫小猪薇格，请给我再做点粥吧！”小猪平平跳了起来，环顾四周。

一只非常可爱的黑色伯克夏小猪正笑眯眯地站在他身旁。那小猪有一双闪闪发亮的眯眯眼，双下巴，短短的小翘鼻。她指着小猪平平的盘子，平平急忙把盘子递给了她，然后跑到了装玉米粉的箱子边。“你是怎么来到这里的？”小猪平平问。

“被偷来的。”小猪薇格说，她的嘴里塞满了东西。平平心安理得地从箱子里拿了玉米粉。

“为什么偷你来？”

“为了做咸肉、火腿呗。”小猪薇格肯定地说。

“你为什么不逃跑呢？”被吓到的小猪平平问道。

“吃过饭后我就会跑的。”小猪薇格说。

小猪平平又做了些粥，害羞地看着她。她吃光了第二盘粥，站起身，看着周围，像是准备马上动身。

“你不能在夜里走。”小猪平平说。

小猪薇格似乎有些担心。

“你白天的时候认识路吗？”

“我知道我们能从河对岸的山上看到这座小白房子。你打算去哪里呢，猪先生？”

“去集市——我有两张猪的许可证。我可以带你到桥边，如果你不反对的话。”平平说，他坐在铜凳的边缘上，脑子一团乱。小猪薇格非常感激他，问了他许多问题，都让平平开始不好意思了。他不得不闭上眼睛，假装睡着了。小猪薇格也安静了下来，空气中传来了薄荷糖的气味。

“我以为你已经把糖都吃了。”小猪平平突然醒了过来。

“只啃了点边儿。”小猪薇格说，她就着炉火的光饶有兴趣地研究着糖纸上的话。

“你最好别吃糖，他隔着天花板都能闻到糖的气味。”小猪平平担心地说。

小猪薇格把黏糊糊的糖放回了口袋里。“唱首歌吧。”她要求道。

“抱歉——我牙疼。”小猪平平惊慌地说。

“那我来唱。”小猪薇格回说，“如果我唱‘嘀哩哩嘀’你不会介意吧？有些歌词我已经忘了。”

平平没有反对，他半闭着眼睛坐着，看着她。她把脑袋摇来晃去，打着节拍，用甜美的、小小的咕哝声唱道：





有一只古怪的猪妈妈，

住在一个猪圈里，

她有三只小猪娃，

嘀哩哩嘀哩哩，嗯嗯嗯

小猪们说：呜喂！呜喂！





小猪薇格成功地唱了三四小节，只是每唱一小节，她的头就会更低一些。她闪光的小眼睛慢慢闭上了。





三只小猪长得瘦又弱，

他们瘦得实在太厉害，

因为他们不说嗯嗯嗯！

而且他们不说哼哼哼！

因为他们不说——





小猪薇格的头越来越低，到最后她蜷成了一团，就像一个圆球一样，很快就在壁炉前的地毯上睡着了。

小猪平平踮着脚，给她盖上了一个椅子罩。他害怕自己也睡过去，那天晚上，他一直坐着，听着蟋蟀的叫声和楼上派伯森先生的呼噜声。

第二天一早，天刚蒙蒙亮，小猪平平便扎好了自己的小包袱，叫醒了小猪薇格。她很激动，又有点儿害怕。“但天还黑着呢！我们该怎么找到路呢？”

“公鸡已经叫过了。我们必须在母鸡出来之前出发。不然她们会大喊，叫醒派伯森先生的。”

小猪薇格又坐了下来，哭了起来。

“起来，薇格，等我们习惯了，就看得清路了。来吧！我听见母鸡们咯咯叫了。”

平平一直脾气很好，从来都没有对母鸡说过“嘘”，另外他想起了那个大筐子。他悄悄地打开了房门，走出去后又关好。这里没有菜园，派伯森先生家周围都被家禽刨得乱糟糟的。他和小猪薇格手拉着手，穿过了一片没打理的田地，向大路走去。

在他们穿越荒原时，太阳升了起来，一道阳光从山顶上照射下来。阳光慢慢地滑过斜坡，洒向平静的绿色山谷，在菜园和果园当中有一些白色的小屋。

“那是威斯特莫兰德。”小猪薇格说，她松开了平平的手，跳起了舞，边跳边唱：





汤姆，汤姆，吹笛人的儿子，

偷了一只猪，然后跑掉了！

但是他会吹的调子只有一首，

《在山的那边遥远的地方》！





“快点，小猪薇格，我们必须在村民们起来之前走到那座桥。”

“你为什么想要去集市，小猪平平？”小猪薇格脱口问道。

“我也不想去。我想种土豆。”

“吃块糖吗？”小猪薇格问。平平气呼呼地拒绝了。

“你那可怜的牙又疼了？”小猪薇格问。平平哼哼了起来。

小猪薇格自己吃掉了薄荷糖，然后顺着路的另一边向前走。“小猪薇格！在墙根儿底下走，那儿有个人在犁地。”小猪薇格过来了，他们急匆匆地下山，往村界处走。

突然，平平停了下来，他听到了车轮声。

在他们下方的路上，慢慢地驶来了一辆商人的马车。缰绳轻拍在马背上，车上的杂货商正读着报纸。

“把糖吐出来，小猪薇格，我们可能得跑一段。什么也别说，别担心。看着那座桥！”可怜的平平说道。他几乎快哭了。他开始一瘸一拐地走起来，还挽住了小猪薇格的胳膊。

那个杂货商的注意力本来都在报纸上，如果他的马没有受惊、打响鼻的话，他可能注意不到小猪平平他们，也就那么过去了。他把马车停到一边，放下了马鞭说：“喂！你们要去哪里啊？”小猪平平茫然地望着他。

“你聋了吗？你们是去集市吗？”小猪慢慢地点了点头。

“我本来昨天也想去的。给我看看你们的许可证。”

平平盯着杂货商的马的后蹄，它那里卡了一块石头。

杂货商挥动了一下鞭子。“证件呢？猪的许可证呢？”

小猪平平翻遍了自己全身的口袋，最后拿出证件递给了杂货商。杂货商看了证件，不过似乎依然不满意。“这只猪是个年轻的女士，她的名字叫亚历山大吗？”薇格张了张嘴，又闭了起来。平平像得了哮喘一样疯狂地咳嗽起来。

杂货商用手指划过报纸上的广告栏。“失踪，被窃或是走失，重谢十先令。”他充满怀疑地看着小猪薇格。然后他在车里站了起来，朝着那个犁地的人吹了声口哨。

“你们在这等着，我过去跟他说句话。”杂货商说着，笼起了缰绳。他知道这些猪很狡猾，不过，一只瘸得很厉害的猪可是跑不起来的！

“现在还不能动，小猪薇格，他会回头看的。”杂货商果然回头看了，他看到两只小猪好像树桩一样，一动不动地待在大路中间。然后他检查了一下自己的马的蹄子，那马现在也瘸了。他找到了犁地的人之后，花了些时间才把那石头弄了出去。

“现在，小猪薇格，赶紧跑！”平平说。

从来都没有任何猪像这两只猪一样跑得那么快！他们一路狂奔，尖叫着冲下了长长的白色山坡，跑向那座桥。小胖猪薇格的衬裙都飞起来了，她连跑带跳，蹄子“啪嗒”“啪嗒”地踩在路上。

他们跑啊，跑啊，一直跑下了山，抄了一条在山脚平坦的绿草地上的近路，走到了鹅卵石河床和灯芯草中间。

他们来到了河边，跑到了桥上，手拉着手过了桥——之后，在山的那边遥远的地方，小猪薇格和小猪平平一起跳起了舞。

城里老鼠约翰尼的故事


城里老鼠约翰尼出生在一个橱柜里。蒂米·威利出生在一个菜园里。蒂米·威利是一只乡下的小老鼠，阴差阳错地被装在一个柳条筐中带到了城里。园丁请送货人每个星期往城里送一次菜，菜被他装在一个大柳条筐子里。

园丁把筐子放在菜园门口，送货人经过的时候就会带走。蒂米·威利从柳条间的一个洞钻进了那个装菜的筐中，吃了一些豌豆，然后，蒂米·威利睡着了。他后来是被吓醒的，当时筐子正被搬起装到送货人的马车上。一阵震动后，传来了“嘚嘚”的马蹄声。其他的包裹也都被不断地装到车上，马车走了很久很久——颠——哒——颠——哒，蒂米·威利在杂乱无章的蔬菜中颤抖个不停。

最后，马车停在了一栋房子前，柳条筐被取了下来，送到房子里，放到地上。厨娘给了送货人六便士，后门被“砰”地关上，马车碌碌地走了。但是并没有安静下来，似乎有几百辆马车不断经过的隆隆声，狗的狂吠声，街上的男孩子们吹口哨的声音，厨娘的大笑声，客厅里的女佣顺着楼梯跑上跑下的声音，还有一只金丝雀像蒸汽引擎一样的叫声。

蒂米·威利自出生以来一直住在那个菜园里，面对这一切简直怕得要死。没过多久，厨娘便打开筐子，往外取蔬菜。被吓坏了的蒂米·威利猛地跳出了筐子。

厨娘吓得跳到了椅子上，尖叫着：“有老鼠！有老鼠！快找猫来！给我取个拨火棍来，莎拉！”蒂米·威利没有等着莎拉拿拨火棍来，他沿着踢脚板拼命地跑，直到看见一个小洞，便一头钻了进去。

他向下坠落了半英尺的距离，跌落到一个老鼠的晚宴当中，还打碎了三个玻璃杯。“这到底是谁啊？”城里的老鼠约翰尼问道。但经过最开始的惊慌之后，他立刻恢复了自己的礼仪。他以最好的礼节，将蒂米·威利介绍给了另外九只小老鼠，他们都有着长长的尾巴，戴着白色领结。蒂米·威利自己的尾巴很短，城里的老鼠约翰尼和他的朋友们都注意到了，但是他们的教养都很好，没有做任何评论，他们中只有一只问蒂米·威利是不是曾经被老鼠夹子困住过。

晚宴由八道菜组成，分量并不多，但是非常优雅。桌子上的菜肴，蒂米·威利都没有见过，他有点儿不敢去尝。只是他非常饿，又很希望能展现出社交礼仪。楼上持续不断传来的声音令他非常紧张，他摔了一个盘子。“没关系，盘子不是我们的。”约翰尼说，“那些年轻人为什么没有带着点心回来呢？”

得解释一下，有两只年轻的老鼠，负责伺候其他老鼠，在上菜的间歇，他们在通往厨房的楼梯上和人起了冲突，有好几次，他们都是滚进来的，尖叫着，大笑着，蒂米·威利得知有猫在追他们之后非常惊恐。他立刻就没了胃口，还觉得有些头晕。

“再吃点果冻？”城里的老鼠约翰尼说，“不要了吗？还是你想上床睡觉了？我会给你一个最最舒服的沙发靠枕。”

那个沙发靠枕上面有个洞。城里的老鼠很热诚地介绍说这是最好的床，是专门为客人留着的。但是沙发上散发着猫的气味。蒂米·威利更愿意在火炉围栏下面度过一个不舒服的夜晚。

第二天情况一模一样。一顿非常丰盛的早餐摆了出来——这些老鼠习惯吃咸肉，但蒂米·威利却从小到大都是以植物的根和沙拉为食。城里的老鼠约翰尼和他的朋友们在地板下面喧闹，在夜里的时候大胆地满屋子乱跑。莎拉端着茶盘跌下了楼梯，发出一声巨响。尽管有猫，但还是有不少的面包屑、糖果和果酱可以收集。

蒂米·威利渴望回家，回到阳光照耀的河岸上他那平静的窝里。这里的食物让他不舒服，噪音吵得人睡不着觉。过了几天，他就瘦了很多，城里的老鼠约翰尼也注意到了，于是便问他怎么了。他听了蒂米·威利对他的菜园的描述，还打听了那个菜园的事情。“听起来是个很无聊的地方啊。下雨的时候，你干些什么？”

“下雨的时候，我就坐在我小小的沙土洞穴里，给秋天时存下的玉米和种子剥皮。我会望着外面草地上的画眉鸟和乌鸫，还有我的朋友知更鸟。等到雨过天晴，太阳出来，你真应该去看看我的菜园和那些花儿，玫瑰，石竹，三色紫罗兰，那里一片宁静，只有鸟唱蜂鸣和草地中的羊羔咩咩叫。”

“那只猫又来了！”城里的老鼠约翰尼叫道。他们躲到储煤室后，他继续刚才的谈话：“我承认，我有点儿失望。我们想要好好招待你的，蒂莫西·威廉[1]。”

“噢，是的，是的，你们都特别热心。但是我觉得很不舒服。”蒂米·威利说。

“可能是因为你的牙齿和消化系统不太适应我们的食物。也许你钻进筐子里面回去比较明智。”

“哦？哦！”蒂米·威利叫道。

“哎呀，我们本来可以上个星期就送你回去的。”约翰尼很懊恼地说，“你难道不知道那个大筐子每个星期六都会空着送回去吗？”

就这样，蒂米·威利和他的新朋友作别，他带着一小块蛋糕和一片蔫了的卷心菜叶子躲到了筐子里。经过很多颠簸，他安全回到了自己的菜园里。

有时候，在星期六，蒂米·威利会看着放在大门口的柳条筐，但是他很清楚地知道不能再次进去。也没有人从筐子里面出来，尽管约翰尼曾经半认真地答应过要来拜访。

冬天过去了。当太阳在新的一天再次起来时。蒂米·威利坐在自己的洞穴边晒着自己小身体上的皮毛，嗅着紫罗兰和春草的香气。他几乎已经忘掉他去城里的旅行了。而就在这时，在沙土小路上走来了一个打扮整洁、一丝不苟、背着棕色皮包的人，那是城里的老鼠约翰尼。

蒂米·威利张开双臂欢迎他。“你在全年中最美好的时候来了，我们可以晒着太阳享用些香草布丁。”

“嗯嗯嗯！这里有点儿潮湿啊！”城里的老鼠约翰尼说。他把尾巴夹在胳膊下面，以防沾到泥土。

“那可怕的声音是什么啊？”他大声惊叫道。

“那？”蒂米·威利说，“那是头奶牛而已。我去找她讨点儿牛奶，她们不会伤害人的，除非是碰巧躺到了你的身上。我们那些朋友怎么样了？”

约翰尼的描述很平淡。他解释自己为什么在开春这么早就来拜访，那户人家去了海边过复活节，厨娘要留下做大扫除，只发伙食费，还得到特别指示要把老鼠都清理干净。家里又多了四只小猫，那只大猫把金丝雀给杀死了。

“他们说是我们干的，但是我很清楚到底是怎么回事。”约翰尼说，“那可怕的喧闹声又是怎么回事？”

“不过是割草机的声音。一会儿我去取些割下来的碎草来给你铺床。我肯定你在乡下会更踏实的，约翰尼。”

“嗯嗯嗯——等下个星期二再说吧。他们去了海边，筐子的送货也停了。”

“我肯定你不会再想回城里生活了。”蒂米·威利说。

但约翰尼还是回去了。是随下一次送菜的筐子回去的。他说村子里面太安静了。

一个地方适合一些人居住，另一个地方适合另外一些人居住。至于我自己，我更愿意住在乡下，就像蒂米·威利一样。

小猪罗宾逊的故事


第一章


我小的时候经常去海边度假。我们住在一个小镇上，那里有一个港口，还有很多渔船和渔民。他们经常出海去捕捞鲱鱼。当渔船回来的时候，有的人只捉到了几条鲱鱼，有的人却捉了很多，多得都没有办法全部卸在码头上。于是，马和马车便会趁着退潮的时候被赶到浅水区，去迎接满载的渔船。那些鱼被从船边卸到马车里，然后送去火车站，那里有一列运鱼的专列。

当渔船满载而归的时候总是令人格外兴奋，镇上一半的人会跑到码头上去，连猫都不例外。

镇上有一只小白猫叫苏珊，每次都去迎接渔船归来，从来都没有落下过一次。她的主人是一个叫萨姆的老渔夫的妻子，这个老妇人叫贝特西。贝特西有风湿病，她只有苏珊和五只母鸡，没有孩子。贝特西坐在火边，她的背疼，每次不得不去添煤或是搅拌锅里的东西时，她都会“哦哦”地呻吟。苏珊坐在贝特西对面。她为贝特西难过，那时她真希望自己会添煤或是搅拌锅里的东西。当萨姆出门去捕鱼的时候，她们就整天坐在炉火边。她们会喝上一杯茶和一些牛奶。

“苏珊，”贝特西说，“我几乎站不起来了。你去门口看看主人的船回来了没有。”

苏珊出去看过，然后又回来。她到花园里去了三四次，最后，在傍晚的时候，她看到了渔船船队的风帆，船队正从海上归来。

“去港口，跟主人要六条鲱鱼，我要用它们做晚饭。拿上我的篮子，苏珊。”

苏珊拿上了篮子，她还借用了贝特西的软帽和彩色格子呢小披肩。我看到她匆匆忙忙地向港口去了。

其他的猫也都从房子里面出来了，顺着陡陡的长街一路跑向海边。鸭子也去了，我记得他们是最特别的鸭子，有着像是苏格兰圆扁帽的顶冠。所有人——几乎是所有人——都匆匆地赶去迎接渔船。我只看到了一个人向相反的方向走去，那是一只叫秃尾巴的狗，他的嘴里叼着一个纸袋。

有些狗不喜欢鱼。秃尾巴去了肉店买羊排给他自己、鲍勃、珀西和萝丝小姐吃。秃尾巴是一只棕色的大狗，很严肃，举止得体，尾巴很短。他与巡回猎犬鲍勃、一只叫珀西的猫和管家萝丝小姐住在一起。秃尾巴的主人是一个很有钱的老绅士，老绅士死的时候，将钱留给了秃尾巴，秃尾巴每个星期能领到十先令，一直到他死为止。所以，秃尾巴、鲍勃和珀西一起住在一个漂亮的小房子里。

提着篮子的苏珊在宽街的街角遇到了秃尾巴。苏珊向他行了个屈膝礼，如果不是赶着去接船，她会停下来向秃尾巴问问珀西的情况。珀西是个瘸子，他的脚是被一辆运奶的马车给轧伤的。

秃尾巴用眼角的余光看了看苏珊，他摇了摇尾巴，但没有停下来。他没有鞠躬行礼，也没有说下午好，因为他害怕把嘴里叼着的装羊排的纸袋弄掉了。他从宽街拐入忍冬巷，他就住在那条巷子里。他推开了前门，进了房子。很快，传来了烹饪的味道，我十分肯定秃尾巴和鲍勃、萝丝小姐很喜欢他们的羊排。

珀西没有在晚餐的时候出现。他从窗户溜了出去，就像镇上其他所有猫一样，他也去接渔船了。

苏珊顺着宽街快步走着，抄了一条近路去港口，那近路是一段陡峭的台阶。鸭子们都很明智地走了另一条路，从海边那里绕过去。对于步履不像猫一样稳健的人来说，那段台阶都太陡峭了，也太滑了。苏珊走得非常轻快。台阶一共有四十三级，夹在高高的房子中间，很黑，也很滑。

从下方传来了绳索和柏油的气味，还有很吵的声音。在台阶的底部，便是码头了，也就是内港旁边的卸货区。

潮水已经退去，下面没有水，小艇都停在脏兮兮的泥中。有几艘船停泊在码头旁边，其他的则停泊在防波堤里。

靠近台阶的地方，有两艘脏污不堪的运煤船正在卸煤，那两艘船，一艘是从桑德兰来的“玛格莉·道号”，另一艘是从加地夫来的“珍妮·琼斯号”。人们推着装满煤的独轮车走在木板上，吊车把煤斗抓起来倾倒在海滩上，发出一阵阵巨响。

码头上再远一点儿的地方，一艘叫“一磅蜡烛号”的船正在把形形色色的货物装船。大包裹、酒桶、板条箱、圆桶——各种各样的货物被装到货舱里面，水手们和搬运工们大声叫着，铰链咣当作响。苏珊寻找着能悄悄通过喧嚷的人群的合适机会。她看到一桶苹果酒正从码头吊着向“一磅蜡烛号”的甲板上装运，此刻悬在空中摇来晃去。一只坐在索具上的黄猫也正看着那只酒桶。

绳子绕过滑轮组，酒桶晃晃悠悠地落向了甲板，下面有一个水手正等着接住它。下面的水手说：

“注意！小心你的头，年轻的先生！站远点儿！”

“喂，喂，喂！”一只粉色的小猪哼哼着，他在“一磅蜡烛号”的甲板上欢快地跑来跑去。

索具上的黄猫看着那只粉色的小猪。索具上的黄猫又打量了一下对面码头上的苏珊。黄猫还眨了眨眼睛。

看到一只猪在一艘船上，这让苏珊非常吃惊。不过她正忙着赶路。她顺着码头前行，从煤堆和吊车中间穿过，从推着推车的人们中穿过，听到了各种声音，闻到了各种气味。她经过鱼市，经过装鱼的箱子，经过鱼类分级机，经过女人们用来装鱼和盐的水桶。

海鸥向下俯冲，鸣叫着。几百个装鱼的箱子、成吨成吨的鲜鱼正被装到一艘小汽船的货舱里面。苏珊很高兴能远离人群，她顺着一段短些的台阶到了外港的海滩上。鸭子们随后就到了，摇摇摆摆，嘎嘎叫着。而老萨姆的船，“贝特西·提明斯号”——捕鱼船队中的最后一艘，满载而归，绕过防波堤而来，把它钝钝的船头驶向鹅卵石滩。

萨姆的情绪高昂，他收获很多。他和他的搭档以及两个小伙子开始将他们的鱼卸到马车上。潮水太低了，没法把渔船泊到码头那边。船上装满了鱼。

但是，不论是否有好运气，萨姆总是会给苏珊一把鱼。

“这是给两个老姑娘的，一顿热腾腾的晚餐！接住，苏珊！就是现在！这条破了的鱼是给你的！现在把另外那些拿给贝特西！”

鸭子们“啪啪”踩着水，狼吞虎咽地吃着小鱼，海鸥们尖叫着，向下俯冲。苏珊提着装着鱼的篮子爬上了台阶，从后街回家。

老贝特西做了两条鱼，给她自己和苏珊吃，另外还有两条鱼是萨姆回来之后的晚饭。然后她用一条法兰绒的衬裙裹着一个热瓶子上了床，这有助于治疗她的风湿病。

萨姆吃了晚饭，又在火炉边抽了一袋烟，然后他也上床睡觉了。但是苏珊在火炉边坐了很久，沉思着。她思考了很多事情——鱼啊，鸭子啊，瘸腿的珀西，吃羊排的狗，船上的黄猫，还有那只猪。苏珊觉得在“一磅蜡烛号”上看到一只猪是很奇怪的事情。老鼠们从橱柜门下面偷偷地向外看。煤渣落在了炉膛中。苏珊轻声地咕噜咕噜叫着，陷入了梦乡，她梦到了鱼和猪。她不能理解一只猪怎么出现在了一条船上。但是我知道那只猪的全部故事！





第二章


你们还记得那首关于猫头鹰和小猫以及他们漂亮的豆绿色小船的歌吗？歌里唱他们是怎么拿到了蜂蜜和卷在一张五英镑钞票里的钱，你们还记得吗？





他们出海远航，一年又一天，

航行到当当树生长的土地上。

在那儿的树林里有一只小猪，

他的鼻子尖上有一个环，

他的鼻子尖上有一个环。





现在，我要给你们讲关于那只猪的故事了，讲讲他为什么去了当当树生长的地方生活。

那只猪很小的时候住在德文郡，跟他的两个阿姨多卡斯小姐和鲍卡斯小姐一起住在一个叫猪舍谷的农场里。他们有一栋舒适的茅草小屋，就位于德文郡的一个果园里，那个果园在一条陡峭的红色小径顶上。

那里的土是红色的，草是绿色的，他们可以看到在下面遥远的地方有红色的悬崖和一片蔚蓝的海洋。张着白色风帆的船在海上航行，航向猪茅斯港。

我经常说德文郡的很多农场名字都很奇怪。如果你见过猪舍谷，你就会觉得住在这里的人也是非常奇怪的！多卡斯阿姨是一只有斑点的猪，身体壮实，她养了些母鸡。鲍卡斯阿姨是一只大黑猪，总是笑眯眯的，她给人洗衣服。在这个故事里，我们不会讲太多关于她们的事，她们过着富裕又平静的生活，最后会变成腌肉。但是她们的外甥罗宾逊却经历了对于一只猪来说非常特别的冒险。

小猪罗宾逊是一个可爱的小家伙，粉白色的皮毛，小小的蓝眼睛，胖乎乎的脸颊，双下巴，翘起的鼻子上面戴着一个真正的银环。罗宾逊如果闭上一只眼睛斜眼看的话，就能看到那个环。

他总是很满足，很开心。他整天都在农场跑来跑去，自己哼着小曲，哼唱着“喂，喂，喂！”在罗宾逊离开之后，他的阿姨们都很悲伤地怀念那些小曲。

“喂？喂？喂？”任何人跟他说话，他都如此回答。“喂？喂？喂？”他听着，头侧向一边，一只眼睛眯着。

罗宾逊的老阿姨们喂养他，宠爱他，当然也支使他。

“罗宾逊！罗宾逊！”多卡斯阿姨叫道，“快来！我听到一只母鸡咯咯叫了，去给我把鸡蛋捡回来，注意不要打破了！”

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊回答，就像个小法国人[1]一样。

“罗宾逊！罗宾逊！我掉了一个晒衣夹，来帮我捡起来。”鲍卡斯阿姨在晾衣服的草地上叫道。她太胖了，几乎没有办法弯下身捡任何东西。

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊回答。

两个阿姨都非常非常壮实。猪茅斯地区的栅栏门都很窄。从猪舍谷中延伸出来的那条小径穿过很多田地——一条在低矮的绿草地和雏菊中有被踩踏出来的红色小路。在小径从一片田地通向另一片田地的地方，树篱当中就肯定会有一道栅栏门。

“并不是我体形太胖了，而是那栅栏门太窄了。”多卡斯阿姨对鲍卡斯阿姨说，“如果我留在家里，你能有办法挤过去吗？”

“不能。我已经有两年都过不去了。”鲍卡斯阿姨回答，“真烦人啊，真烦人啊，那个赶车的人在市集的前一天把驴车给弄翻了。一打鸡蛋可以卖两先令两便士！要是不穿农田而绕大路，你说得走多远啊！”

“至少四英里，”鲍卡斯阿姨叹息道，“而我的肥皂都用到最后一点儿了。我们到底该怎么去买东西啊？驴子说马车得一个星期才能修好。”

“如果你在吃饭前去，你不觉得你能挤过栅栏门吗？”

“不，不能。我会卡得死死的，你也会。”鲍卡斯阿姨说。

“你不觉得我们可以试着——”多卡斯阿姨提议。

“试着让罗宾逊走小路去猪茅斯？”鲍卡斯阿姨说完了建议。

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊回答。

“我真不愿意让他一个人出去，尽管他很机灵。”

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊回答。

“但是没有别的办法了。”多卡斯阿姨说。

所以，罗宾逊被丢进了洗澡盆里，用最后一点儿肥皂给他洗了澡。他的身体被用力擦洗，然后擦干，最后就像是一根新别针那么光亮。然后姨妈们给他穿上了一件小小的蓝色棉布上衣和短裤，吩咐他拎着一个大购物篮去猪茅斯买东西。

篮子里面有两打鸡蛋、一束黄水仙、两棵花椰菜，另外还有罗宾逊的饭——面包夹果酱的三明治。他需要把鸡蛋、鲜花和蔬菜在集市上卖掉，然后买回各种各样的东西。

“你自己在猪茅斯要当心，罗宾逊外甥。提防火药、船上面的厨师、家具搬运车、香肠、鞋子、船，还有封蜡。记住要买蓝色书包、肥皂、织补毛线——还有什么东西？”多卡斯阿姨说。

“织补毛线、肥皂、蓝色书包、酵母——还有什么东西？”鲍卡斯阿姨说。

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊应声。

“蓝色书包、肥皂、酵母、织补毛线、卷心菜种子——这是五样东西，应该有六样的。是比四样多两样的，因为用他的手帕的四个角打结计数多出了两个。需要买六样东西，应该是——”

“我想起来了！”鲍卡斯阿姨说，“是茶叶——茶叶、蓝色书包、肥皂、织补毛线、酵母和卷心菜种子。你应该能在孟比先生的店里买到大部分东西。跟孟比先生解释赶车人的事情，罗宾逊，告诉他我们下个星期会带去洗好的衣服和更多的蔬菜。”

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊回答道，便带着大篮子出发了。

多卡斯阿姨和鲍卡斯阿姨站在门廊里，她们看着他顺利而安全地远去，走过田野，穿过第一个栅栏门。回去料理家务时，她们一直对彼此抱怨和发火，因为她们都不放心罗宾逊。

“我希望我们没有让他去。都怪你和你那讨厌的蓝书包！”多卡斯阿姨说。

“蓝书包，没错！都怪你那织补毛线和鸡蛋！”鲍卡斯阿姨嘟囔着，“赶车人和他的驴车真烦人！为什么他就不能躲着沟渠到集市日之后？”





第三章


去猪茅斯的路是非常远的，尽管走的是穿越田野的捷径。不过那条小路整个都是下坡路，所以罗宾逊走得非常开心。他唱着他的小曲，享受着美丽的清晨，他咯咯地笑着，说着“喂，喂。喂”，在他头上高高的地方，云雀也唱着歌。

在更高的地方，高高的、蔚蓝的天空之上，巨大的白色海鸥绕着大圈子盘旋，他们嘶哑的叫声从那么高的地方传到地上已经变得柔和了很多。威严的秃鼻乌鸦和活泼的渡鸦趾高气扬地在草地上的雏菊花和毛茛花当中踱着步。小羊羔蹦蹦跳跳，咩咩地叫着。绵羊们打量着罗宾逊。

“在猪茅斯要自己小心啊，小猪。”一只母羊说。

罗宾逊快步走着，走得有些喘不过气来，全身发热。他已经走过了五大片田地，很多很多栅栏门。那些栅栏门中有带台阶的，有带梯子的，有木头桩子的，其中有些栅栏门要带着大篮子通过非常不方便。当他回头望的时候，已经望不到猪舍谷的农场了。在他前方遥远的地方，在大片大片的农田和悬崖的另一边，深蓝色的大海就如同一堵墙般立了起来——尽管看起来并没有变近点儿。

罗宾逊在一道树篱边遮荫的地方坐下来休息。在他头上方，黄色的褪色柳正在开花。旁边的河床上盛开着成百上千的报春花，空气中飘着苔藓、青草和潮湿的红土地的暖融融的气息。

“如果我现在把饭吃了，就不用再提着它了。喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊说。

刚刚走了那么长的路，他饿极了，他除了想吃掉果酱三明治外，还想吃个鸡蛋，但是他的教养太好了。“那样就不是两打了。”罗宾逊说。

他摘了一束报春花，用多卡斯阿姨给他做参照样本的一段织补毛线捆了起来。“我在集市上把它卖掉，赚的钱是我自己的，然后用我的钱买些糖果。我有几便士呢？”罗宾逊说着摸着自己的口袋，“一个是多卡斯阿姨给的，一个是鲍卡斯阿姨给的，还会有一个是我卖报春花自己赚的——哦，喂，喂，喂！有人正顺着大路跑呢！去赶集要迟了！”

罗宾逊跳起来，推着他的大篮子穿过了一个非常窄的栅栏门，小路就此汇入了公路。他看到了一个骑马的人。老派珀瑞尔先生骑着一匹白腿的栗色马过来了，他那两只高大的灵犬走在前面，所有经过的田地他们都要透过大门的栅栏看看。他们跳向了罗宾逊，动作很夸张，很热情，他们舔他的脸，问他篮子里面有什么。派珀瑞尔先生叫他们回去。

“过来，海盗！过来，邮差！过来，先生！”他可不希望回头去赔那些鸡蛋。

路上新铺了一层尖碎的石子。派珀瑞尔先生骑着栗色马走在草地边缘，和罗宾逊说着话。他是个很风趣的老先生，很和气，红脸膛，白胡子。猪茅斯和猪舍谷之间所有绿色田地和红色耕地都是他的。

“好啊！好啊！你去哪里啊，小猪罗宾逊？”

“你好，派珀瑞尔先生。先生，我要去集市。喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊说。

“什么，你一个人？多卡斯小姐呢？鲍卡斯小姐呢？我想她们没有生病吧？”

罗宾逊解释了栅栏门太窄的事情。

“天啊，天啊！太胖了，太胖了？所以你就一个人去集市？你的阿姨们为什么不养条狗来跑腿呢？”

罗宾逊非常有条理又得体地回答了派珀瑞尔先生的所有问题。他展现出了足够的智慧，以及对蔬菜的丰富知识，特别是对于像他这么小的小猪来说。他几乎是在马下面小跑，仰头看着那马闪光的栗色皮毛，宽宽的白色肚带，以及派珀瑞尔先生的绑腿和棕色皮靴。派珀瑞尔很喜欢罗宾逊，他也给了罗宾逊一便士。走出碎石区后，他拉起缰绳，用脚跟碰了碰马。

“好吧，祝你愉快，小猪。向你的阿姨们问好。在猪茅斯要自己当心啊。”他吹了声口哨招唤他的狗，然后便纵马小跑着走了。

罗宾逊继续走在路上。他经过了一个果园，有七只又瘦又脏的猪在那里拱土。他们的鼻子上都没有银环。罗宾逊走过猪滩桥，都没有停下来从防护墙上看看水中的小鱼，它们正逆流向上游，在缓缓流动的水中保持着平衡。他也没有看在一片片水毛茛中游来游去的白鸭。到了猪滩磨坊，他帮多卡斯阿姨给磨坊主带了一个关于谷粉的口信，磨坊主的妻子给了他一个苹果。

在磨坊那边的房子里，有一只见人就叫个不停的大狗，但是这只大狗吉卜赛只是冲罗宾逊笑着摇尾巴。有好几辆马车路上超过了他。起先，两个老农夫拧着身子盯着罗宾逊。他们在小马车的后排座位上放着两只鹅、一口袋土豆和一些洋白菜。后来，有一个老妇人赶着一辆驴车经过，车上有七只母鸡、几捆长长的粉色大黄，那些大黄是长在苹果桶下面的稻草当中的。然后，伴随着一阵铁罐子的咣当叮当的声音，罗宾逊的表弟小猪汤姆驾着一辆枣红色小马拉的牛奶车过来了。如果他不是要走相反的方向，他本可以让罗宾逊搭便车的。实际上，那匹枣红色的小马正在往家跑呢。

“这只小猪去集市了！”小猪汤姆喜气洋洋地喊道，伴随着一团尘土飞扬和一阵“吱吱嘎嘎”的声音，他从罗宾逊的视线中消失了，只留下罗宾逊站在马路上。

罗宾逊顺着路继续走，没多久，他又来到了对面的树篱中的一道栅栏门边，在那里小路又通向了田地里。罗宾逊把他的大篮子弄到了栅栏门的另一边。他第一次感到了一些不安。在这片地里有一些奶牛——体形壮硕、皮毛光滑的德文郡牛，它们是暗红色的，就像是这里的土地一般。牧群的头领是一只凶猛的老奶牛，她的牛角尖上拧着黄铜球。她很不悦地瞪着罗宾逊。罗宾逊以自己最快的速度急忙穿过草场，从另一处栅栏门那里出来了。新踩踏出来的小路绕过一片嫩绿色小麦地的边缘。“砰”的一声，有人放了一枪，吓了罗宾逊一跳，把篮子里多卡斯阿姨的一个鸡蛋给打碎了。

一大群秃鼻乌鸦和渡鸦嘎嘎叫着、厉声骂着，从小麦地中飞了出来。他们的叫声中还夹杂着其他的声音，从田地边缘的榆树那边隐隐传来猪茅斯镇上的喧嚣，从车站传来的遥远的声音，引擎的呼啸声，火车转轨时的撞击声，作坊的声音，远处小镇低沉而忙碌的声音，还有汽船进入海港时的汽笛声。从头上的高空传来了海鸥嘶哑的叫声，秃鼻乌鸦聒噪的叫声，有老有少，就在他们位于榆树高处的鸦巢中争吵不休。

罗宾逊离开了最后一片田地，走到了车水马龙的人流中，有人步行，有人赶车，全都是去往猪茅斯的集市的。





第四章


猪茅斯是一个很小的小镇，就位于猪圈河河口上，河水就在河口处徐缓地汇入高耸的红色岬角下的海湾。小镇本身依山而建，顺着山坡向下蔓延，像是要滑向山中的盆地一样。整个镇子朝向大海，渐渐趋近猪茅斯港口，码头和外围的防波堤守护着那个港口。

镇子的外围就如同大多数的海港一样，不太整洁。小镇西入口的郊区很荒凉，居民基本上是山羊，以及处理废铁、碎布、油麻绳以及渔网的人。那里有很多制作绳子的作坊，洗了的衣服在晃晃荡荡的绳子上飘动，下面便是鹅卵石遍布的堤岸，还散布着海藻、海螺壳和死螃蟹——和鲍卡斯阿姨在干净的绿草地上的晾衣绳截然不同。

那里有航海商店，店里卖小望远镜、防水帽和洋葱，那里总有各种味道。奇怪而高耸的棚子，样子就像是岗哨一样，人们把渔网挂在那里晾干，脏兮兮的房子里面总是有大声说话的声音。那里看上去就像一个极有可能遇到家具搬运车的地方。罗宾逊走在路中央，一家酒吧里有人透过窗户冲他喊道：“进来啊，肥猪！”罗宾逊吓得落荒而逃。

猪茅斯镇本身很干净，赏心悦目，风光如画，景色宜人（港口总是例外）。但是这个镇在非常陡峭的山坡上，如果罗宾逊从高街的顶上把多卡斯阿姨的一个鸡蛋滚下去，它就会一路滚到街尾，只是这鸡蛋肯定会撞在台阶上摔碎，或是被人踩碎。因为是集市日，街上有很多人。

事实上，在人行道上，很难不被推出去，罗宾逊遇到的每个老妇人似乎都拿着一个和他的篮子一样大的篮子。在路上，有卖鱼的推车，卖苹果的推车，卖陶瓷器具和五金用品的摊位，公鸡和母鸡在马车中，驴子驮着筐子，农民赶着装满干草的车。另外，街上还有一长串从码头过来的运煤的马车。对于一只在乡村长大的小猪来说，这里的噪音混乱而令人恐惧。

罗宾逊一直保持着镇定，直到他走入前街，那里有一只牧牛犬正努力地把三只小牛赶入一个院子中，秃尾巴和镇上一半的狗都在给他帮忙。罗宾逊和另外两只拎着装满芦笋的篮子的小猪逃入了一条巷子中，躲进了一户人家的门洞里，直到牛叫声和犬吠声过去。

当罗宾逊鼓足勇气再来到前街的时候，他决定尽可能地紧跟在一头驴子的尾巴后面，那驴子背上驮着装满了春花椰菜的筐子。要猜出哪条路是去集市的，毫不费力。但是经过了这些耽搁，此时，教堂的钟声已经响了十一下，也就不足为奇了。

尽管集市从十点就开始了，而此时在集市大厅中依然有许多买东西的顾客，有许多等待出售的货物。这是一个宽敞明亮、通风好又热闹的封闭场所，顶子是玻璃做的。里面虽然人山人海，但是和外面卵石街道上拥挤嘈杂的场面比较，却安全又令人舒服。无论如何，这里不会有被人撞到的危险。这里也一片喧嚣，卖东西的人叫卖着货物，顾客们堆挤在摊位周围。奶制品、蔬菜、鱼、贝类都陈列在平平的货架板上。

罗宾逊在母山羊内蒂卖玉黍螺的摊位旁找到了一个摊位。

“海螺！海螺！螺！螺！螺！咩咩！”母山羊咩咩地吆喝着。她的摊位上只有海螺，所以罗宾逊的鸡蛋和报春花并没有引起她的戒备。她不知道他还有花椰菜，罗宾逊很聪明地把它们放在了桌子下面的篮子当中。他站在一个空的箱子上，在货架后面很骄傲、很勇敢地大声吆喝：

“鸡蛋，新下的！新鲜的鸡蛋！谁来看看啊，来买我的鸡蛋和水仙花啊！”

“我要买，”一只尾巴残缺不全的棕色大狗说，“我要买一打鸡蛋。我的萝丝小姐让我来集市买鸡蛋和黄油。”

“很抱歉，我没有黄油，秃尾巴先生，但是我有很漂亮的花椰菜。”罗宾逊说着提出了篮子。之前他谨慎地扫视了一下母山羊内蒂，担心她会过来啃花椰菜。此时，内蒂正忙着给一个头戴苏格兰扁帽的鸭子顾客用一个白蜡杯子量海螺。“这都是非常好的红皮鸡蛋，不过有一个被撞坏了。我想对面的那只小白猫卖黄油——这是非常漂亮的花椰菜。”

“我要买一个花椰菜，亲爱的，保佑他那小翘鼻子，是在自家菜园里面种出来的吗？”老贝特西说着凑了过来，她的风湿痛好了一些，苏珊被留下看家了。“不，亲爱的，我不想要鸡蛋。我自己养鸡。一个花椰菜，一束能装满大花瓶的水仙，谢谢。”贝特西说。

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊回应。

“过来，珀金斯太太，来这边！看看这只小猪，他自己就支应一个摊子！”

“哎呀，我不知道呢！”珀金斯太太说着挤过人群，她后面跟着两个小女孩，“哎呀，我从没见过呢！这是新下的蛋吗，孩子？它们不会突然爆开，弄脏我礼拜天的裙子吧？就像怀恩多特太太在五次花展中得头等奖的那些鸡蛋一样，那些鸡蛋突然爆开，弄脏了裁判的黑色丝绸裙子。不是用咖啡染成了这个颜色的鸭蛋吧？那是花展上的另一个把戏！新下的蛋，你保证？只是你说有一个撞坏了？我必须说你是真正的诚实，如果做煎蛋的话倒是不会有影响。我要一打鸡蛋和一个花椰菜，谢谢。看，萨拉·波莉！来看看他的银鼻环！”

萨拉·波莉和她的小伙伴咯咯咯一阵笑，罗宾逊的脸一下子红了。他实在很慌乱，都没有注意到有一位女士想要买走他最后一棵花椰菜，直到那位女士碰了碰他。他的东西差不多都卖光了，只剩下了一束报春花。两个小女孩又咯咯笑了一阵，窃窃私语了一会儿，回来买走了报春花。除了一便士，她们还给了罗宾逊一颗薄荷糖，罗宾逊接受了，却没有太兴奋，而是有些心不在焉。

他刚把那束报春花卖掉，就意识到他把多卡斯阿姨给他的织补毛线的样品也一起卖掉了。他在想自己是不是该去把它要回来，但是珀金斯太太、萨拉·波莉和她的小伙伴已经不见了。

卖掉了所有东西的罗宾逊离开了集市大厅，他的嘴里含着薄荷糖。这时依然有人在向集市大厅里走。罗宾逊来到外面的台阶上时，他的篮子和一只正在向里挤的老绵羊的围巾挂在了一起。就在罗宾逊解围巾的时候，秃尾巴走了出来。他已经买完东西了。他的篮子里面装着买来的东西，满满的、沉甸甸的。秃尾巴是一只尽责、忠诚、乐于助人的狗，很愿意去帮助所有人。

当罗宾逊向他询问去孟比先生的店怎么走时，秃尾巴说：“我要从宽街回家。你和我一起走吧，我给你指路。”

“喂，喂，喂！啊，谢谢你，秃尾巴！”罗宾逊说。





第五章


老孟比先生是一个已经耳聋了的老人，戴着眼镜。他开着一家杂货店，只要你能想象到的东西，他几乎都卖，除了火腿——这受到了多卡斯阿姨的大力称赞。在猪茅斯，只有在这家店里，你不会看到在柜台上摆着一大盘令人生厌的颜色灰白、细细的、成串的生香肠，也不会看到有一卷卷的腌肉吊在天花板上。

“那怎么能令人愉快呢？”多卡斯阿姨激动地说，“进入一家会迎头撞上一根火腿的店怎么能令人愉快呢？尤其是火腿可能是一个亲爱的远房亲戚的腿啊！”

因此，两位阿姨都从孟比老先生的店里买糖、茶、蓝色书包、肥皂、煎锅、火柴和大杯子。他卖所有这些东西，还有很多其他东西，有一些店里没有库存的东西，他会去订购。但是酵母必须非常新鲜，他不卖。所以建议罗宾逊去面包房里买酵母。他还说，现在买卷心菜种子已经有些晚了，大家都已经把今年的蔬菜种子播种完了。织补毛线他也卖，不过罗宾逊把需要的颜色给忘了。

罗宾逊用自己的钱买了六根美味的黏麦芽糖，然后认真地听着孟比先生给多卡斯和鲍卡斯阿姨带的口信——关于下个星期驴车应该就修理好了，她们应该送一些卷心菜过来；关于那个水壶为什么还没有修理好；以及他要推荐一种新的专利产品——匣子式熨斗给鲍卡斯阿姨。

罗宾逊说：“喂，喂，喂！”并仔细听着，小狗迪普金斯站在柜台后面的一个凳子上，试着把买的东西包在蓝色的纸包里——小狗迪普金斯小声对罗宾逊说——“今年春天猪舍谷的谷仓里面有老鼠吗？星期六下午你会做什么？”

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊回答。

罗宾逊离开孟比先生的店时，带着沉甸甸的东西。麦芽糖真好吃，但是他还担心着织补毛线、酵母和卷心菜种子的事情。他正焦急地四处张望的时候，碰到了老贝特西太太，她叫道：

“保佑这只小猪吧！还没回家呢？可不要在猪茅斯逗留，肯定会遇到小偷的！”

罗宾逊解释了自己买织补毛线的麻烦。善良的老贝特西很乐于助人。“啊，我注意到了那一小束报春花上拴着的毛线了，是蓝灰色的，和我上次给萨姆织的一双袜子的颜色一样。跟我一起去毛线店——绒绒·棉棉的毛线店，我记得那个颜色，记得很清楚！”贝特西说。

棉棉太太就是那只撞到了罗宾逊的绵羊，她给自己买了三个萝卜，然后就直接离开集市回家了，因为她害怕自己的店关着门会流失顾客。

这是什么店啊！简直乱透了！全是各种颜色的毛线，粗的，细的，手工编织毛线，地毯毛线，一捆一捆的，全都堆在一起，棉棉太太什么都找不到。她也迷糊了，找东西慢腾腾的，贝特西太太都不耐烦了。

“不，我要的不是编拖鞋的毛线，是织补毛线，绒绒，和我买来给我的萨姆织袜子的毛线是一样颜色的。天啊，不对，不是织补针！是织补毛线！”

“咩咩！你要的是白色的还是黑色的，太太？要三股，是不是？”

“哎，天啊，缠在纸卡上的蓝灰色织补毛线，不是杂色线。”

“我知道就是放在一个什么地方了，”绒绒·棉棉无助地说，她把一捆捆、一团团的毛线全混在了一起，“公羊西姆今天早晨送来了一些母羊汉普顿的羊毛，我的店里就彻底乱了——”她用了半小时才找到毛线。如果贝特西没有陪着罗宾逊的话，他根本就买不到毛线。

“天太晚了，我必须回家了。”贝特西说，“我的萨姆今天上岸吃饭，如果你听我的建议，你可以把那个沉甸甸的大篮子放在金翅雀小姐那里，然后赶紧去买东西，你回猪舍谷可是要走一段很长的上山路呢。”

罗宾逊急切地接受了老贝特西的建议，向金翅雀小姐那里走去。路上，他去了一家面包房，他记得还要买酵母。但是很不幸，这并不是面包房，那里飘荡着一股好闻的烤面包的香气，窗户里还放着面团，但是这是一家餐厅或小吃店。

当他推开转门时，一个戴着围裙和白色四角帽的男人转过身来，说：“你好！这是一个在用后腿走路的猪肉馅饼吗？”一个餐桌边的四个粗鲁男人一阵爆笑。

罗宾逊匆匆地离开了这家店，他感到害怕，不敢再去任何面包店。他愁眉苦脸地望着前街上另一家店的橱窗时，又遇到了秃尾巴。秃尾巴已经把自己的篮子拿回了家，现在又出来买别的东西。他叼着罗宾逊的篮子，带罗宾逊去了一家很安全的面包房，他总是去那里给自己买饼干。在那里，罗宾逊终于买到了多卡斯阿姨要的酵母。

他们找了半天没有找到卷心菜种子。有人告诉他们唯一可能有卷心菜种子的地方是码头上的一家小店，那个店是两只鹡鸰开的。

“很遗憾我不能跟你一起去了。”秃尾巴说，“我的萝丝小姐扭伤了脚踝，她让我去买十二张邮票，我得在邮件发出前，把邮票买回家交给她。不要带着这沉重的篮子在台阶上走上走下，放到金翅雀小姐那里吧。”

罗宾逊很感激秃尾巴。两位金翅雀小姐开着一个卖咖啡和茶的小店，多卡斯阿姨和那些喜欢安静的赶集人都经常光顾这里。在门口的招牌上画着一只肥肥的绿色小鸟，写着“满足的金翅雀”，这是这家咖啡店的名字。她们有一个牲口棚，送货人星期六来猪茅斯送洗好的衣服的时候，他的驴子就在那里休息。

罗宾逊看起来非常疲惫，所以两位金翅雀小姐中的姐姐给了他一杯茶，但是两位金翅雀小姐都要他快点喝完。

“喂，喂，喂！咦咦！”罗宾逊说，他烫到了鼻子。

尽管两位金翅雀小姐非常尊敬多卡斯阿姨，但是她们很反对他一个人来购物，她们说这篮子对他来说太重了。

“我们两个都提不动。”大金翅雀小姐说着，举起了一只小细爪，“买到你的卷心菜种子，快点回来。公羊西姆的小马车还在我们的牲口棚里，如果你能在他出发之前回来，我肯定他会愿意捎你一段，至少他的座位下面有地方放你的篮子——他会经过猪茅斯。现在就跑着去！”

“喂，喂，喂！”罗宾逊说。

“她们到底是怎么想的呢，让他一个人来这里？他绝对不可能在天黑前回到家的。”大金翅雀小姐说，“飞去牲口棚，克拉拉，告诉公羊西姆的小马，不带上篮子就不要出发。”

小金翅雀小姐飞过院子。她们都是勤勤恳恳、活泼好动的小雌鸟，茶叶罐中不仅有茶叶，还有方糖和蓟的种子。她们的桌子和瓷器都干净得一尘不染。





第六章


猪茅斯有很多很多小酒馆，简直到处都是。农民们经常把马停在“黑公牛”或是“马和蹄铁匠”这两家店里，而体形较小的赶集人则更喜欢去“猪和哨声”酒馆。

在前街的街角还有一家小酒馆，名字叫“王冠和锚”，是水手们经常去的店，现在，就有几个正手插在口袋里在这家店门口闲逛。一个穿着蓝色毛线衫的水手从马路对面走了过来，目光炯炯地盯着罗宾逊。他说道：“我说，小猪！你喜欢鼻烟吗？”

如果说罗宾逊犯了什么错误的话，那就是他不会拒绝，甚至对偷鸡蛋的刺猬，他也不会说“不要”。事实上，无论是鼻烟，还是烟草，都令他难受。但是他没说“不，谢谢你，先生”，然后继续去忙自己的事情，而是拖着脚步慢了下来，半闭上一只眼睛，歪着头，发出了咕噜声。

那个水手拿出一个牛角做的鼻烟盒，从中捏出一小撮递给罗宾逊，罗宾逊用一小张纸把那鼻烟包了起来，准备送给多卡斯阿姨。然后，出于礼尚往来，他给了水手一些麦芽糖。

尽管罗宾逊不喜欢鼻烟，但他的新朋友对糖可没有表现出反感。他狼吞虎咽地吃了起来，然后他拉着罗宾逊的耳朵，开始恭维他，说他有五层下巴。他承诺带罗宾逊去卖卷心菜种子的店铺，最后，他希望能有幸带罗宾逊参观一艘做生姜买卖的船，那船由屠夫巴拿巴船长指挥，名叫“一磅蜡烛”。

罗宾逊不是很喜欢这个船名，这个名字让他想到了牛油和猪油，想到了熏猪肉时噼噼啪啪的爆裂声和所放的配料。但是他还是同意跟随前往。他害羞地笑了，踮着脚走路。真希望罗宾逊能知道啊……这个人是船上的厨子！

他们走出高街，顺着陡峭的窄巷而下，走向码头之时，老孟比先生在他的店门口焦急地喊着：“罗宾逊！罗宾逊！”但是路上车来车往，噪声很大。这时又恰好有一个客人来到店里面，分散了他的注意力，他忘记了那个水手的可疑表现。否则，就算看在两个阿姨的面上，他肯定会让他的狗迪普金斯去把罗宾逊带回来。因此，当人们发现罗宾逊失踪了的时候，他是第一个向警方提供有用信息的人。可是那时已经太晚了。

罗宾逊和他的新朋友顺着长长的台阶走向了低处的港口，那可是非常高的台阶，既陡峭又湿滑，小猪不得不一级级地往下跳，直到水手友好地拉住他。他们手牵着手走在码头上，样子实在可笑。

罗宾逊饶有兴趣地打量着周围的一切，在他过去坐驴车来猪茅斯的时候，也曾经从那些台阶上往下看过，却从来都不敢下去，因为那些水手非常粗鲁，他们经常会养些龇着牙狂叫的小狗看守船只。

港口里面有很多船，一片喧嚣，和上面的集市一样热闹。一艘名叫“金凤花”的巨大的三桅船正在卸一船橘子；再远一些的地方，一艘从布里斯托来的名叫“小波比”的近海双桅船正在往船上装一大包一大包的羊毛，那些羊毛是从母羊汉普顿和羊羔沃斯的羊群剪下来的。

老公羊西姆，大大的弯角上挂着一个铃铛，站在舷梯上，数着羊毛包的数量。每当吊车转过来，通过滑轮上的绳子放进舱里一包羊毛的时候，他就点一下他苍老的头，他的铃铛就叮叮当当响一阵儿，同时他还发出一声粗哑的“咩咩”的叫声。

公羊西姆见过罗宾逊，应该给罗宾逊警告的。他经常赶着小马车，穿过田园中的小路，经过猪舍谷。但是此时恰好是他瞎了的那只眼睛对着码头，而且因为到底往船上装了三十四包羊毛还是三十五包羊毛和事务长起了争执，正心烦意乱着呢。所以，他把他那只好用的眼睛认真地盯在了羊毛上，用他的计数棒上的刻痕来计数：一包羊毛，就数一下刻痕——三十五，三十六，三十七，他希望最后的数字是正确的。

他的短尾牧羊犬提莫西·吉普也认识罗宾逊，但是他这会儿正在忙着监督一只运煤船“玛格莉·道号”上的艾尔谷犬和“金凤花号”上的西班牙犬之间的争斗。最后两只狗都从码头上跌落下去，掉进了水里，没有人理会它们的叫声和嘶吼。罗宾逊跟着水手，紧紧地拉着水手的手。

“一磅蜡烛号”是一艘很大的纵帆船，新近才刷过油漆，船上装饰着不少旗子，不过罗宾逊看不明白它代表的意义。船停在防波堤的尽头，潮水正在迅速地上涨，浪花拍打着船舷，把固定船只的缆绳绷得紧紧的。

水手们正在船长屠夫巴拿巴的指挥下往船上装载货物，捆扎固定。船长是一个棕黑色皮肤的瘦削海员，嗓音沙哑。他把东西扔来推去，嘴里嘟囔个不停，他的话在码头上都能听到。他正说着拖船“海马号”，说着春汛，说着春汛之后的东北风，还有面包房老板和新鲜的蔬菜，“十一点整启航，而且要一大块——”他突然间停住了话头，眼睛落在了厨子和罗宾逊的身上。

罗宾逊和厨子是通过一条摇摇晃晃的木板上的船，罗宾逊一踏上甲板，就发现自己和一只正给靴子打油的大黄猫脸对着脸。

那只猫猛地一惊，把鞋油刷弄掉了，然后他开始冲着罗宾逊眨眼和做鬼脸。罗宾逊从来都没有见过一只这样表现的猫，他问猫是不是病了。厨子丢了一只靴子砸向猫，猫“噌”的一下便钻进了索具里，而罗宾逊则被厨子热情地邀请到了下面的船舱里，去享用松饼和圆饼干。

我不知道罗宾逊吃了多少松饼。他一直不停地吃啊吃，最后他睡着了。他一直睡着，直到他的凳子摇晃了一下，他从凳子上摔了下去，滚到了桌子底下。这时，天翻地覆，船舱的地板变成了天花板，天花板变成了地板，盘子飞了起来，船上一阵阵呐喊、重击声和铁链的吱嘎声，以及其他可怕的声音。

罗宾逊慢慢地爬起来，感觉颠簸得厉害。他爬上一段通向甲板的小梯子，然后那恐怖的叫声令他也尖叫了起来！船周围都是绿色的巨浪，码头上的房子都变得像玩偶屋一样。就在内陆高处的地方，在红色悬崖和绿色的田野上方，他能够看到猪舍谷农场，看上去比一张邮票大不了多少。果园里面的一块小白补丁，是鲍卡斯阿姨洗的东西，摊开了晾在草地上。旁边，黑色的拖船“海马号”冒着烟，颠簸着，摇晃着。这条船被“一磅蜡烛号”扔出去的拖绳拽得打转。

巴拿巴船长站在纵帆船的船头，冲着拖船的船主大声喊着。水手们也在大声呐喊，用力地拖拽，要把船帆升起来。船体向一侧倾斜，穿过巨浪，空气中有一股海腥味。

至于罗宾逊，他六神无主地在甲板上转了一圈又一圈，不停地大声尖叫，有好几次，他都滑倒了，因为甲板倾斜得很厉害，但是他一直跑啊跑。最后，他的尖叫声变成了歌声，但是他还是一直跑。他的歌是这样唱的：





可怜的小猪罗宾逊，

哦，他们怎么会这么做啊？

把他放在船上顺水漂，一艘可怕的船，

哦，可怜的小猪罗宾逊！





水手们都笑得流出了眼泪，但是罗宾逊把这首歌唱了五十多遍，还跑到一些水手的腿中间，弄得水手们很烦，于是他们生气了。甚至船上的厨子对罗宾逊都不再客气了，何止是不客气，简直是粗鲁，他说如果罗宾逊还继续用鼻子哼哼这首歌，就把他做成烤肉排。

然后罗宾逊晕了过去，摔倒在“一磅蜡烛号”的甲板上。





第七章


罗宾逊在那艘船上没有受到一丝虐待。相反，他在“一磅蜡烛号”上吃得非常好，很受宠，比在猪舍谷的时候要好多了。所以，罗宾逊仅仅思念了几天他和蔼的老阿姨（特别是他晕船的时候），就变得非常满足和快乐了。他不再晕船之后，就整天在甲板上跑来跳去，直到他变得太胖了，整个人懒懒的，才不再跑了。

厨子不辞辛劳地给他煮粥。一整袋的玉米粉，一整袋的土豆，似乎是专门为了他的健康和快乐而准备的。他想吃多少就吃多少，好好地吃上一顿饭，然后躺在暖洋洋的甲板上，这让他非常快乐。随着船驶向南方，天气越来越暖和，他变得越来越懒，大副将他当作宠物，水手们给他美味的零食吃，厨子总是爱抚他的背部，挠他的身体两侧——不过他的肋骨那里已经感觉不到痒了，因为他现在长了太多肥肉。船上不把他当玩物对待的，只有那只黄色的公猫，还有船长巴拿巴屠夫，船长的脾气很坏。

黄猫对罗宾逊的态度让人很困惑，显然，他很看不惯罗宾逊喝玉米粥，他还神神秘秘地说到贪吃的恶果，说过度放纵的不良后果，但是他没有解释会是什么样的恶果。而那只黄猫既不爱吃玉米粥，也不在乎美食，罗宾逊觉得他的警告可能是因为偏见，他并不是不友好，他只是悲伤，并且有一种不祥的预感。

黄猫正在失恋中，他闷闷不乐，阴沉悲观，有一部分原因是因为和猫头鹰分别。那只甜美的小雌鸟是一只雪白的拉普兰猫头鹰，它在一艘北方的捕鲸船上，航向了格陵兰。而“一磅蜡烛号”则在航向热带海域。

因此，那只黄猫无心工作，和厨师之间的关系很差。他没好好擦皮靴，也没好好伺候船长，而是日日夜夜都在索具里，对着月亮唱歌，时不时会回到甲板上，就开始数落罗宾逊。

黄猫从来都没有直接告诉过罗宾逊为什么不应该吃得太多，但是他频繁地提到一个神秘的日子（罗宾逊一直都记不住是哪一天）——那是屠夫船长的生日，他每年的那一天都会享用一顿特别丰盛的大餐。

“所以，他们才会储存苹果。洋葱完蛋了——太热了，都发芽了。我听巴拿巴船长告诉厨师，只要有苹果做调味酱，洋葱就不重要。”

罗宾逊没有注意听。实际上，他和黄猫都在船身的一侧，看着一大群银鱼。船几乎完全停住不动。厨师穿过甲板过来，想看看黄猫在看着什么，看到新鲜的鱼后高兴地叫了起来。立刻，一半的船员都开始钓鱼。他们在鱼线上拴上猩红色的羊毛和饼干做鱼饵，水手长的鱼饵是一颗亮闪闪的纽扣，他成功地钓到了很多鱼。

用纽扣钓鱼最不好的地方就是：很多鱼在被拉向甲板的过程中又掉到海里面去了。所以，屠夫船长便让水手们放出小船，从叫作“吊柱”的铁装置上放到平静的大海表面。五个水手上了小船，黄猫也跳进去了。他们钓鱼钓了好几个小时，海面上没有一丝风。

由于黄猫不在，罗宾逊便在甲板上陷入了安详的梦中。过了一阵，他被大副和厨师的声音吵醒了，他们两个没有去钓鱼。大副说：

“我不喜欢中了暑的里脊肉。厨子，把他弄醒，或是扔块帆布把他盖上。我自己也是在农场长大的，猪是绝对不能睡在火热的太阳下面的。”

“为什么？”厨子问。

“中暑。”大副回答，“也会把猪皮晒伤的，弄得像是被剥了皮一样，破坏了烤肉时脆皮的外观。”

就在这时，一块沉甸甸、脏兮兮的帆布被扔过来盖到了罗宾逊的身上，罗宾逊立刻就发出了一阵咕噜声，挣扎着踢蹬。

“他听见你的话了，大副？”厨师低声说。

“不知道，没关系，他下不了船。”大副说着点燃了烟斗。

“可能会破坏他的胃口。最近把他养得多漂亮啊！”厨师说。

没多久，便传来了船长巴拿巴屠夫的声音。他在下面的船舱中午休了一阵儿，现在来到了甲板上。

“去主桅杆的瞭望台，根据经纬度，用望远镜观察一下地平线。根据地图和指南针的显示，我们应该是到了群岛中间了。”屠夫船长说。

这声音透过帆布，传到了罗宾逊的耳朵里，虽然声音发闷，但是很清楚。不过大副却没有怎么听，当没有别人在的时候，他会时不时地跟船长对着干。

“我的鸡眼非常疼。”大副说。

“那就让猫上去。”巴拿巴船长快速命令道。

“猫在钓鱼的小船上。”

“那就把他叫回来。”巴拿巴船长的脾气爆发了，“他已经有两个星期没有给我的靴子打油了。”他走下船舱，顺着一道梯子走入了舱房，继续研究经度和纬度，寻找着群岛。

“希望他能在下星期四之前把脾气搞好，不然就享受不了烤猪肉了！”大副对船长说。

他们走到甲板的另一面，去看都钓到了什么鱼。小船已经回来了。

天气非常晴朗，小船被留在了如平镜般的大海上过夜，拴在了“一磅蜡烛号”船尾的一个舷孔（也叫舷窗）下面。

黄猫被分派带着望远镜爬上桅杆，他在上面停留了一段时间。下来的时候，他报告说什么都没看到，这当然不是真话。那天晚上，“一磅蜡烛号”上没有安排特别的警卫和放哨人员，因为大海上风平浪静。如果需要人放哨的话，那就应该是黄猫了。船上其余人都在玩纸牌。

黄猫和罗宾逊没有参加。黄猫注意到帆布下面有轻微的动静，然后发现是罗宾逊在下面害怕地发抖，脸上全是泪。他听到了关于猪肉的对话。

“我肯定我已经给过你足够的暗示了。”猫对罗宾逊说，“你以为他们为什么喂养你？现在不要尖叫。你这个小傻瓜！事情非常简单，只要你认真听，不要再哭了。你能划桨吧，差不多就行。”（罗宾逊出去钓过几次鱼，抓到过好几只螃蟹。）

“呃，其实你不用走太远。我在桅杆上能看到东北偏北方向一座岛屿上的当当树的树梢。群岛的海峡太窄了，‘一磅蜡烛号’过不去，我会把别的小船都凿穿，来吧，按我说的做。”黄猫说。

黄猫这么做，一部分是因为无私的友谊，一部分是因为对厨师和船长巴拿巴屠夫的不满，所以他帮助罗宾逊收拾了各种各样的必需品：鞋子、封蜡、刀子、扶手椅、钓具、草帽、锯子、捕蝇纸、土豆罐、望远镜、水壶、指南针、锤子、一桶面粉、一桶玉米面、一壶淡水、一个大杯子、一把茶壶、几根钉子、一个水桶、一把螺丝刀——

“这提醒我了。”黄猫说着，拿起一把锥子，到了甲板另一边，把还留在“一磅蜡烛号”上的三艘小船都钻出了几个大洞。

这时，下面传来了令人不安的声音，那些手气不好的水手有些不想玩牌了。所以，黄猫匆匆地和罗宾逊道别，推着他到了船舷，罗宾逊顺着绳子滑落到小船上。黄猫解开了绳子上面拴着的部分，在罗宾逊身后丢了下来。然后他爬到索具之上，假装在值班的时候睡着了。

罗宾逊跌跌撞撞地坐下来开始划桨。他的腿很短，不好划桨。船舱当中，巴拿巴船长突然间停住了发牌的动作，他手里拿着一张牌，侧耳倾听（厨师趁机偷看了牌），然后他继续“啪啪”地发牌，这声音盖住了平静大海上划船的声音。

又玩了一轮牌后，两个水手离开船舱，去了甲板上。他们注意到远处好像有什么东西，看上去是一只黑色的大甲虫。其中一个水手说，那是一只巨大的蟑螂，正在用后腿游泳呢。另一个说，那是一只海豚。他们争论不休，声音很大。巴拿巴船长在厨师发牌的一轮没有拿到一张好牌，所以，也来到了甲板上，他说：

“把我的望远镜拿来。”

望远镜不见了。另外，鞋子、封蜡、指南针、土豆罐、草帽、锤子、钉子、水桶、螺丝刀和扶手椅都不见了。

“坐小船去看看那是什么。”屠夫船长命令道。

“小船没问题，不过要是只海豚呢？”大副反对道。

“啊，我的天啊，小船不见了！”一个水手叫道。

“用其他的船，把另外三条小船都用上。是那只猪和那只猫！”船长吼道。

“不对，先生，猫在索具上面睡觉呢。”

“把那只猫弄醒！把猪带回来！苹果酱要浪费掉了！”厨师尖叫道，手里挥舞着刀叉。

吊柱摆动起来，“嗖！”“啪！”船被放了下去，所有水手都挤到船上，开始拼命地划船。接着他们大多数都飞快地拼命划回“一磅蜡烛号”。因为每条小船都漏得很厉害，这全是那只黄猫的功劳。





第八章


罗宾逊划着小船离开了“一磅蜡烛号”。他牢牢地抓着船桨。对他来说，船桨很重。太阳已经落下去了，但是我知道，在热带——虽然我从来都没有去过——海面上有一种磷光。当罗宾逊抬高桨的时候，上面的水珠从桨片上滴落，仿佛钻石一样。没多久，月亮从海平面上升起来，就像是半个巨大的银色盘子。罗宾逊靠在桨上，望着大船，大船在月光下，在波澜不惊的大海上，一动不动。就在这时——他已经距离大船有四分之一英里远了——那两个水手到了甲板上，觉得他的小船是一只在游泳的甲虫。

罗宾逊离得太远了，看不到“一磅蜡烛号”上的混乱，也听不到船上的喧嚣，但没多久，他就发觉三条小船放了下来追他。他不由自主地开始尖叫，拼了命地划桨。但是他的力气还没有用完，那些小船就掉头回去了。这时罗宾逊想起了那只黄猫用锥子做的事情，他知道那些船漏了。那夜天亮前，他都在安静地划着桨，不慌不忙。空气凉爽怡人，他不想睡觉。第二天，天很热，而罗宾逊躲在帆布下面睡得很香，这帆布是黄猫细心地给他带上的，如果他需要支帐篷就可以用上了。

大船从视线中消失了——你们知道，大海并不真的是平的。他先是看不到船体，然后看不到甲板，然后只能看到桅杆的一部分，再然后便什么都看不见了。

罗宾逊是依靠大船来控制自己的航向的，现在看不到这个指明方向的标记，他便拿出了指南针——这时，“砰！”“砰！”船触到了沙丘上，幸好小船没有搁浅。

罗宾逊站在船上，划着一只桨向后退，打量着四周。而他看到的，就是当当树的树梢！

又划了半个小时，他来到了一个土壤肥沃的大岛的岸边。他在一个便利的避风港安全登陆，银色的海滨上流动着滚沸的水，海滩上满是牡蛎。各种酸的甜的糖果长在树上。甘薯，这是一种甜的马铃薯，已经煮熟，随处可见。面包树上结着滚糖霜的蛋糕和松饼，全都烘焙好了。没有哪只猪会还想着玉米粥。头顶上是高耸的当当树。

如果你想要得到更多关于这个岛的细节描述，你必须要读读《鲁滨逊漂流记》。这个当当树岛非常像鲁滨逊那个岛，只是没有那些缺点。我自己从来都没有去过，我是听猫头鹰和猫说的，他们在十八个月之后去了那座岛，在那里度了一个愉快的蜜月。他们说起那里的天气都非常兴奋——不过那里对猫头鹰来说太热了。

后来，秃尾巴和小狗迪普金斯去看了罗宾逊，他们发现他过得非常满足，身体也很健康。他根本不想回猪茅斯。反正据我所知，罗宾逊可能现在还生活在那座岛上。他变得越来越胖，越来越胖，越来越胖。而船上的厨师一直都没有找到他。

三只小老鼠


三只小老鼠，坐下来纺纱。

小猫经过了，偷偷看过来。

你们在干吗，我的好伙计？

我们做衣服，给绅士们穿。

让我进去吧，帮你们咬线头儿。

哦，不用了！猫小姐，你会咬掉我们的头！





狡猾的老猫


有一只狡猾的老猫，准备办一个茶会，招待一只老鼠。

老鼠穿上了他最好的衣服，顺着楼梯下楼。

他们要在厨房里饮茶。

“你好啊，老鼠先生？你愿意坐在这张椅子上吗？”猫说。

“我要先吃我的面包和黄油，”猫说，“然后你再吃掉下来的碎屑，老鼠先生！”

“这样招待客人可是够粗鲁的！”老鼠先生暗自说道。

“现在我要给自己倒茶了，”猫说，“你就舔留在牛奶罐上的那几滴牛奶吧，老鼠先生，然后我会吃些甜点。”猫又说。

“我相信她会把我当甜点吃了的，我真希望自己没来。”可怜的老鼠先生说。

老猫把牛奶罐倒了过来——这只贪婪的老猫！她一滴牛奶也不想给老鼠留下。

但是老鼠突然跳上桌子，狠狠地拍了罐子一下，罐子口朝下，正好紧紧地扣在了老猫的头上。然后老猫头上顶着罐子，在厨房里跌跌撞撞。

老鼠坐在桌子上，拿起一个杯子喝茶。然后他用纸袋装了一块松饼，便离开了。他一口气吃光了整个松饼。这就是老鼠的结局。

而猫在厨房桌子的腿上撞碎了牛奶罐，这就是猫的结局。





狐狸和鹳


“先生，”托德先生对鹳王说，“我能有幸请您和我一起用茶吗？”鹳王鞠了一躬。他和狐狸先生一起走回家，路上他昂首阔步，托德先生快步小跑。

托德先生是一个吝啬的人。他刚一提出邀请，想到鹳先生的体形，就后悔了。所以，他想了个主意。他对鹳说：“我招待客人的时候，都会使用我曾祖母的德比郡茶具。”他把茶倒到了两个浅浅的碟子里。

鹳王把他的尖喙浸入碟子，不过他几乎没有办法喝到一滴茶。没多久，他鞠了一躬，便离开了。托德先生自己一个人把剩下的茶都舔着喝光了。

他的良知告诉他，他的表现很差劲，所以当收到鹳王请他去吃午餐的邀请时，他真的很吃惊。

邀请信是一只神经兮兮的凤头麦鸡送来的。

鹳王的家在一座高高的老房子屋顶上的一个高高的烟囱顶上。托德先生没有翅膀，没有办法飞到屋顶上去，所以鹳王下来，在庭院里迎接他，然后领着他进了屋子里，爬上了一道螺旋楼梯。当他们到达阁楼的时候，闻到了一股诱人的肉汤的香味。那肉汤是装在两个细颈的罐子中的。

鹳王把长长的喙插入一个罐子，吸食着汤。而托德先生只能舔着嘴唇，闻闻味儿。没多久，他就站起来，说：“再见！”

鹳王把喙从空罐子中抽出来。他是一只沉默寡言的老鹳。他只说了一句：“一报还一报。”





兔子们的圣诞派对


客人们都来了，

宴会准备好了，

开始跳舞了，

大家玩起了捉迷藏，

围着火炉烤苹果，

然后就该回家了。

THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT


Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were—Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. They lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree.

“Now, my dears,” said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, “you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden. your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor. Now run along, and don't get into mischief. I am going out.”

Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.

Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries; but Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!

First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes; and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley. But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!

Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, “Stop thief!”

Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate. He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.

Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.

Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him, and rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.

Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.

Presently Peter sneezed—“Kertyschoo!” Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work.

Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can. After a time he began to wander about, going lippity—lippity—not very fast, and looking all around. He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.

An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.

Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.

He went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe—scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!

Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.

Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.

Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten the blackbirds.

Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree. He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!

I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.

His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!

“One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.”

But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries, for supper.

THE END





THE TALE OF SQUIRREL NUTKIN


This is a tale about a tail—a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin. He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins; they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.

In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.

One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green—Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.

They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts. Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail. They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.

Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely—

“Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?”

But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and down like a little red cherry, singing—





“Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!

A little wee man in a red red coat!

A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;

If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.”





Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin. He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.

The squirrels fill their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.

But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said—

“Mr. Brown, will you favor us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?”

But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a nettle and singing—





“Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!

Hitty Pitty within the wall,

Hitty Pitty without the wall;

If you touch Hitty Pitty,

Hitty Pitty will bite you!”





Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house. He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang—





“A house full, a hole full!

And you cannot gather a bowl-full!”





The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks. But Nutkin gathered oak-apples—yellow and scarlet—and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.

On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown. They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.

Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in front, singing—





“The man in the wilderness said to me,

‘How many strawberries grow in the sea?’

I answered him as I thought good—

‘As many red herrings as grow in the wood.’”





But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles—not even when the answer was provided for him.

On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for Old Brown. Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.

But Nutkin sang as Rudely as ever—





“Old Mr. B.! Riddle-me-ree!

Flour of England, fruit of Spain,

Met together in a shower of rain;

Put in a bag tied round with a string,

If you'll tell me this riddle I'll give you a ring!”





Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.

The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.

On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble bees' nest on the tippitty top of the hill.

But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing—





“Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!

As I went over Tipple-tine

I met a flock of bonny swine;

Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!

They were the very bonniest swine

That e'er went over Tipple-tine.”





Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin. But he ate up the honey!

The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.

But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.

On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid egg in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.

But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting—





“Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,

With a white counterpane round his neck,

Forty doctors and forty wrights,

Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!”





Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. But still he did not speak.

Nutkin became more and more impertinent—





“Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!

Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door;

All the King's horses, and all the King's men,

Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,

Off the King's kitchen door!”





Nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam, but still Old Brown said nothing at all.

Nutkin began again—





“Arthur O'Bower has broken his band,

He comes roaring up the land!

The King of Scots with all his power,

Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!”





Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown! ... Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud “Squeak!”

The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes. When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree—there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened. But Nutkin was in his waist-coat pocket!





This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.

Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase, and escaped out of the attic window.

And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout—

“Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r cuck-k-k!”

THE END





THE TAILOR OF GLOUCESTER


In the time of swords and periwigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets—when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffeta—there lived a tailor in Gloucester.

He sat in the window of a little shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on a table, from morning till dark.

All day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippeted, piecing out his satin and pompadour, and lutestring; stuffs had strange names, and were very expensive in the days of the Tailor of Gloucester.

But although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours, he himself was very, very poor—a little old man in spectacles, with a pinched face, old crooked fingers, and a suit of thread-bare clothes.

He cut his coats without waste, according to his embroidered cloth; they were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table—“Too narrow breadths for nought—except waistcoats for mice,” said the tailor.

One bitter cold day near Christmastime the tailor began to make a coat—a coat of cherry-coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses, and a cream-coloured satin waistcoat—trimmed with gauze and green worsted chenille—for the Mayor of Gloucester.

The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself. He measured the silk, and turned it round and round, and trimmed it into shape with his shears; the table was all littered with cherry-coloured snippets.

“No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!” said the Tailor of Gloucester.

When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window-panes and shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table.

There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat; and there were pocket flaps and cuffs, and buttons all in order. For the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta; and for the button-holes of the waistcoat, there was cherry-coloured twist. And everything was ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient—except that there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk.

The tailor came out of his shop at dark, for he did not sleep there at nights; he fastened the window and locked the door, and took away the key. No one lived there at night but little brown mice, and they run in and out without any keys!

For behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from house to house through those long narrow passages; they can run all over the town without going into the streets.

But the tailor came out of his shop, and shuffled home through the snow. He lived quite near by in College Court, next the doorway to College Green; and although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only rented the kitchen.

He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin. Now all day long while the tailor was out at work, Simpkin kept house by himself; and he also was fond of the mice, though he gave them no satin for coats!

“Miaw?” said the cat when the tailor opened the door. “Miaw?”

The tailor replied—“Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling. Take this groat (which is our last fourpence) and Simpkin, take a china pipkin; buy a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk and a penn'orth of sausages. And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our fourpence buy me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk. But do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for I have no more twist.”

Then Simpkin again said, “Miaw?” and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark.

The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill. He sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.

“I shall make my fortune—to be cut bias—the Mayor of Gloucester is to be married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat—to be lined with yellow taffeta—and the taffeta sufficeth; there is no more left over in snippets than will serve to make tippets for mice—”

Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises—

Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!

“Now what can that be?” said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his chair. The dresser was covered with crockery and pipkins, willow pattern plates, and tea-cups and mugs.

The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser, listening, and peering through his spectacles. Again from under a tea-cup, came those funny little noises—

Tip tap, tip tap, Tip tap tip!

“This is very peculiar,” said the Tailor of Gloucester; and he lifted up the tea-cup which was upside down. Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a curtsey to the tailor! Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.

The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands, and mumbling to himself—

“The waistcoat is cut out from peach-coloured satin—tambour stitch and rose-buds in beautiful floss silk. Was I wise to entrust my last fourpence to Simpkin? One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured twist!”

But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises:

Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!

“This is passing extraordinary!” said the Tailor of Gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down. Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!

And then from all over the dresser came a chorus of little tappings, all sounding together, and answering one another, like watch-beetles in an old worm-eaten window-shutter—

Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!

And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other and more little mice, who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot.

The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting—“One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured silk! To be finished by noon of Saturday; and this is Tuesday evening. Was it right to let loose those mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin? Alack, I am undone, for I have no more twist!”

The little mice came out again, and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining, and about little mouse tippets.

And then all at once they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another, as they ran from house to house; and not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came back with the pipkin of milk!

Simpkin opened the door and bounced in, with an angry “G-r-r-miaw!” like a cat that is vexed; for he hated the snow, and there was snow in his ears, and snow in his collar at the back of his neck. He put down the loaf and the sausages upon the dresser, and sniffed.

“Simpkin,” said the tailor, “where is my twist?”

But Simpkin set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups. He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!

“Simpkin,” said the tailor, “where is my twist?”

But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked—“Where is my mouse?”

“Alack, I am undone!” said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.

All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!

Whenever the tailor muttered and talked in his sleep, Simpkin said “Miaw-ger-r-w-s-s-ch!” and made strange horrid noises, as cats do at night.

For the poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled—“No more twist! No more twist!”

All that day he was ill, and the next day, and the next; and what should become of the cherry-coloured coat? In the tailor's shop in Westgate Street the embroidered silk and satin lay cut out upon the table—one-and-twenty button-holes—and who should come to sew them, when the window was barred, and the door was fast locked? But that does not hinder the little brown mice; they run in and out without any keys through all the old houses in Gloucester!

Out of doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their geese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no Christmas dinner for Simpkin and the poor old Tailor of Gloucester.

The tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas Eve, and very late at night. The moon climbed up over the roofs and chimneys, and looked down over the gateway into College Court. There were no lights in the windows, nor any sound in the houses; all the city of Gloucester was fast asleep under the snow. And still Simpkin wanted his mice, and he mewed as he stood beside the four-post bed.

But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk, in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).

When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer—like an echo of the chimes—and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.

From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes—all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.

First and loudest the cocks cried out—“Dame, get up, and bake your pies!”

“Oh, dilly, dilly, dilly!” sighed Simpkin.

And now in a garret there were lights and sounds of dancing, and cats came from over the way.

“Hey, diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle! All the cats in Gloucester—except me,” said Simpkin.

Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jackdaws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; the air was quite full of little twittering tunes.

But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin!

Particularly he was vexed with some little shrill voices from behind a wooden lattice. I think that they were bats, because they always have very small voices—especially in a black frost, when they talk in their sleep, like the Tailor of Gloucester. They said something mysterious that sounded like—





“Buz, quoth the blue fly, hum, quoth the bee,

Buz and hum they cry, and so do we!”





and Simpkin went away shaking his ears as if he had a bee in his bonnet.

From the tailor's shop in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily—





“Four-and-twenty tailors

went to catch a snail,

The best man amongst them

durst not touch her tail,

She put out her horns

like a little kyloe cow,

Run, tailors, run! or she'll

have you all e'en now!”





Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again—





“Sieve my lady's oatmeal,

Grind my lady's flour,

Put it in a chestnut,

Let it stand an hour—”





“Mew! Mew!” interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door. But the key was under the tailor's pillow; he could not get in.

The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune—





“Three little mice sat down to spin,

Pussy passed by and she peeped in.

What are you at, my fine little men?

Making coats for gentlemen.

Shall I come in and cut off your threads?

Oh, no, Miss Pussy, you'd bite off our heads!”





“Mew! Mew!” cried Simpkin. “Hey diddle dinketty?” answered the little mice—





“Hey diddle dinketty, poppetty pet!

The merchants of London they wear scarlet;

Silk in the collar, and gold in the hem,

So merrily march the merchantmen!”





They clicked their thimbles to mark the time, but none of the songs pleased Simpkin; he sniffed and mewed at the door of the shop.





“And then I bought

A pipkin and a popkin,

A slipkin and a slopkin,

All for one farthing—





and upon the kitchen dresser!” added the rude little mice.

“Mew! scratch! scratch!” scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout at once in little twittering voices—“No more twist! No more twist!” And they barred up the window shutters and shut out Simpkin.

But still through the nicks in the shutters he could hear the click of thimbles, and little mouse voices singing—





“No more twist! No more twist!”





Simpkin came away from the shop and went home, considering in his mind. He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully. Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot, and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!

When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!

“Alack, I am worn to a ravelling,” said the Tailor of Gloucester, “but I have my twist!”

The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.

The starlings whistled on the chimney stacks, and the throstles and robins sang—but they sang their own little noises, not the words they had sung in the night.

“Alack,” said the tailor, “I have my twist; but no more strength—nor time—than will serve to make me one single button-hole; for this is Christmas Day in the morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon—and where is his cherry-coloured coat?”

He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something. But there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!

The boards were swept and clean; the little ends of thread and the little silk snippets were all tidied away, and gone from off the floor. But upon the table—oh joy! the tailor gave a shout—there, where he had left plain cuttings of silk—there lay the most beautifullest coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester! There were roses and pansies upon the facings of the coat; and the waistcoat was worked with poppies and corn-flowers. Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured button-hole, and where that button-hole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words—in little teeny weeny writing—





NO MORE TWIST





And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich. He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.

Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets! But his button-holes were the greatest triumph of it all. The stitches of those button-holes were so neat—so neat—I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble. The stitches of those button-holes were so small—so small—they looked as if they had been made by little mice!

THE END





THE TALE OF BENJAMIN BUNNY


One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank. He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.

A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.

As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off—with a hop, skip and a jump—to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.

That wood was full of rabbit-holes; and in the neatest sandiest hole of all, lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins—Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter.

Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffetees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar). She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).

Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt. He came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter. Peter was sitting by himself. He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.

“Peter,”—said little Benjamin, in a whisper—“who has got your clothes?”

Peter replied—“The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden,” and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.

Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin, and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.

Peter said he hoped that it would rain.

At this point, old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit-hole, calling—“Cotton-tail! Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!”

Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk. They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden. Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.

Little Benjamin said, “It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in, is to climb down a pear tree.”

Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft. It had been sown with lettuces. They left a great many odd little foot-marks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.

Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief. They took them off the scarecrow. There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.

Benjamin tried on the tam-o-shanter, but it was too big for him. Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.

Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises. Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.

(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)

The lettuces certainly were very fine.

Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. Presently he dropped half the onions. Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear tree, with a load of vegetables. He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny red-brick wall.

The mice sat on their door-steps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.

Presently Peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again. They got amongst flower-pots, and frames and tubs; Peter heard noises worse than ever, his eyes were as big as lolly-pops! He was a step or two in front of his cousin, when he suddenly stopped.

This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!

Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket…

The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket. Perhaps she liked the smell of onions! Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket. She sat there for five hours.





I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.

The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket. At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above. The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace. He was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand. He was looking for his son.

Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats. He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the garden-house, scratching off a handful of fur. The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.

When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the green-house, he locked the door. Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch. Then he took out his nephew Peter. Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.

When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later, he observed several things which perplexed him. It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs—only the foot-marks were too ridiculously little! Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the green-house, locking the door upon the outside.

When Peter got home, his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and rabbit-tobacco.

THE END





THE TALE OF TWO BAD MICE


Once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney.

It belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals. Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings. There were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges. They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.

One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator. There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.

Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again. Tom Thumb was a mouse.

A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.

The doll's house stood at the other side of the fireplace. Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug. They pushed the front door—it was not fast.

Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room. Then they squeaked with joy!

Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table! There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs—all so convenient!

Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham. It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red. The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth. “It is not boiled enough; it is hard. You have a try, Hunca Munca.”

Hunca Munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.

“It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's,” said Hunca Munca. The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.

“Let it alone,” said Tom Thumb; “give me some fish, Hunca Munca!”

Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish. Then Tom Thumb lost his temper. He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel—bang, bang, smash, smash! The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!

Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca. They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges. As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either. Tom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top—there was no soot.

While Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment. She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labelled—Rice—Coffee—Sago—but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.

Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could—especially Tom Thumb! He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window.

But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind. After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed. With Tom Thumb's assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearthrug. It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse-hole; but they managed it somehow.

Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird-cage, and several small odds and ends. The book-case and the bird-cage refused to go into the mouse-hole. Hunca Munca left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.

Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing. The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.

What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!

Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled—but neither of them made any remark.

The book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal-box—but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda's clothes. She also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.

The little girl that the doll's house belonged to, said—“I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!”

But the nurse said—“I will set a mouse-trap!”





So that is the story of the two Bad Mice—but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke. He found a crooked sixpence under the hearthrug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.

And very early every morning—before anybody is awake—Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!

THE END





THE TALE OF MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE


Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl—only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!

One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying—oh, she did cry so! “I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have you seen them, Tabby Kitten?”

The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen—

“Sally Henny-penny, has you found three pocket-handkins?”

But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking—

“I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!”

And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig. Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.

Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town—a hill that goes up—up—into the clouds as though it had no top! And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.

Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way—up and up—until Little-town was right away down below—she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!

Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside. Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water—but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet—there were foot-marks of a very small person.

Lucie ran on, and on.

The path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins—but no pocket-handkerchiefs! But there was something else—a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing—





“Lily-white and clean, oh!

With little frills between, oh!

Smooth and hot—red rusty spot

Never here be seen, oh!”





Lucie knocked—once—twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out “Who's that?”

Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?—a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams—just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.

There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie. Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap—where Lucie had yellow curls—that little person had prickles!

“Who are you?” said Lucie. “Have you seen my pocket-handkins?”

The little person made a bob-curtsey—“Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear-starcher!” And she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.

“What's that thing?” said Lucie—“that's not my pocket-handkin?”

“Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!”

And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side. Then she took something else off a clothes-horse—

“That isn't my pinny?” said Lucie.

“Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!” said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.

Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.

“There's one of my pocket-handkins!” cried Lucie—“and there's my pinny!”

Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.

“Oh that is lovely!” said Lucie. “And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?”

“Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny—look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go barefoot!” said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.

“Why, there's another handkersniff—but it isn't mine; it's red?”

“Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell.”

“There's another one of mine,” said Lucie.

“What are those funny little white things?”

“That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.”

“There's my last pocket-handkin!” said Lucie.

“And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?”

“They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Tit-mouse—most terrible particular!” said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. “Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.”

“What are these dear soft fluffy things?” said Lucie.

“Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.”

“Will their jackets take off?” asked Lucy.

“Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town. They're always marked at washing!” said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.

And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes—small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing—and at last the basket was empty!

Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea—a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.

When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.

And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill. Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!

All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny! And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.

Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say “Good-night,” and to thank the washer-woman—But what a very odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill! She was running running running up the hill—and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown—and her petticoat?

And how small she had grown—and how brown—and covered with prickles!

Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog.





(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile—but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?

And besides—I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells—and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)

THE END





THE TALE OF THE PIE AND THE PATTY-PAN


Once upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess, to tea.

“Come in good time, my dear Duchess,” said Ribby's letter, “and we will have something so very very nice. I am baking it in a pie-dish—a pie-dish with a pink rim. You never tasted anything so good! And you shall eat it all! I will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!” wrote Ribby.

Duchess read the letter and wrote an answer—“I will come with much pleasure at a quarter past four. But it is very strange. I was just going to invite you to come here, to supper, my dear Ribby, to eat something most delicious.”

“I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby,” wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added—“I hope it isn't mouse?” And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out “isn't mouse” and changed it to “I hope it will be fine,” and she gave her letter to the postman. But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.

“I am dreadfully afraid it will be mouse!” said Duchess to herself—“I really couldn't, couldn't eat mouse pie. And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party. And my pie was going to be veal and ham. A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's.”

Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it. “It is all ready to put into the oven. Such lovely pie-crust; and I put in a little tin patty-pan to hold up the crust; and I made a hole in the middle with a fork to let out the steam—Oh I do wish I could eat my own pie, instead of a pie made of mouse!”

Duchess considered and considered and read Ribby's letter again—

“A pink and white pie-dish—and you shall eat it all. ‘You’ means me—then Ribby is not going to even taste the pie herself? A pink and white pie-dish! Ribby is sure to go out to buy the muffins… Oh what a good idea! Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?” Duchess was quite delighted with her own cleverness!

Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come—she popped her pie into the oven. There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open. Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.

“The top oven bakes too quickly,” said Ribby to herself. “It is a pie of the most delicate and tender mouse minced up with bacon. And I have taken out all the bones; because Duchess did nearly choke herself with a fish-bone last time I gave a party. She eats a little fast—rather big mouthfuls. But a most genteel and elegant little dog; infinitely superior company to Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.”

Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth. Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle. Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen. She shook the mats out at the front door and put them straight; the hearthrug was a rabbit-skin. She dusted the clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, and she polished and rubbed the tables and chairs.

Then she spread a very clean white tablecloth, and set out her best china tea-set, which she took out of a wall-cupboard near the fireplace. The tea-cups were white with a pattern of pink roses; and the dinner-plates were white and blue.

When Ribby had laid the table she took a jug and a blue and white dish, and went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter. When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.

Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.

And just at the same time, Duchess came out of her house, at the other end of the village.

Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth. They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.

As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight—she simply ran! Straight away to Ribby's house!

Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.

Cousin Tabitha was disdainful afterwards in conversation—

“A little dog indeed! Just as if there were no cats in Sawrey! And a pie for afternoon tea! The very idea!” said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.

Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins. Then she went home. There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.

“I trust that is not that Pie: the spoons are locked up, however,” said Ribby. But there was nobody there. Ribby opened the bottom oven door with some difficulty, and turned the pie. There began to be a pleasing smell of baked mouse!

Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door. “It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was not in the oven when I put mine in! And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house. I put my pie into a nice hot oven at the top. I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams,” said Duchess, “but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse! I cannot think what she has done with it? I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!”

Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.

Ribby—having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder—went upstairs to change her dress. She put on a lilac silk gown, for the party, and an embroidered muslin apron and tippet.

“It is very strange,” said Ribby, “I did not think I left that drawer pulled out; has somebody been trying on my mittens?” She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob. She peeped again into the bottom oven; the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.

She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. “I am glad I used the bottom oven,” said Ribby, “the top one would certainly have been very much too hot. I wonder why that cupboard door was open? Can there really have been someone in the house?”

Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party. She ran so fast through the village that she was too early, and she had to wait a little while in the lane that leads down to Ribby's house.

“I wonder if Ribby has taken my pie out of the oven yet?” said Duchess, “and whatever can have become of the other pie made of mouse?”

At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity. “Is Mrs. Ribston at home?” inquired Duchess in the porch.

“Come in! and how do you do? my dear Duchess,” cried Ribby. “I hope I see you well?”

“Quite well, I thank you, and how do you do, my dear Ribby?” said Duchess. “I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!”

“Oh, what lovely flowers! Yes, it is mouse and bacon!”

“Do not talk about food, my dear Ribby,” said Duchess; “what a lovely white tea-cloth! . . . Is it done to a turn? Is it still in the oven?”

“I think it wants another five minutes,” said Ribby. “Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait. Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?”

“Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?”

“With pleasure, my dear Duchess; how beautifully you beg! Oh, how sweetly pretty!”

Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed— “How good that pie smells! I do love veal and ham—I mean to say mouse and bacon—” She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea-table, so she did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.

Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.

Duchess came out from under the tablecloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.

“I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade,” said Ribby.

“Do you really prefer muffin? Mind the patty-pan!”

“I beg your pardon?” said Ribby.

“May I pass you the marmalade?” said Duchess hurriedly.

The pie proved extremely toothsome, and the muffins light and hot. They disappeared rapidly, especially the pie!

“I think”—(thought the Duchess to herself)—“I think it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it. What very small fine pieces it has cooked into! I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own.”

“How fast Duchess is eating!” thought Ribby to herself, as she buttered her fifth muffin.

The pie-dish was emptying rapidly! Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.

“A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?” said Ribby.

“Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan.”

“The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?”

“The patty-pan that held up the pie-crust,” said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.

“Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess,” said Ribby; “I don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse.”

Duchess fumbled with the spoon—“I can't find it!” she said anxiously.

“There isn't a patty-pan,” said Ribby, looking perplexed.

“Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?” said Duchess.

“There most certainly is not one, my dear Duchess. I disapprove of tin articles in puddings and pies. It is most undesirable—(especially when people swallow in lumps!)” she added in a lower voice.

Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.

“My Great-aunt Squintina (grandmother of Cousin Tabitha Twitchit)—died of a thimble in a Christmas plum-pudding. I never put any article of metal in my puddings or pies.”

Duchess looked aghast, and tilted up the pie-dish.

“I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.”

Duchess set up a howl.

“I shall die! I shall die! I have swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!”

“It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan.”

Duchess moaned and whined and rocked herself about.

“Oh I feel so dreadful. I have swallowed a patty-pan!”

“There was nothing in the pie,” said Ribby severely.

“Yes there was, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!”

“Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?”

“Oh I do feel so ill all over me, my dear Ribby; I have swallowed a large tin patty-pan with a sharp scalloped edge!”

“Shall I run for the doctor? I will just lock up the spoons!”

“Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby; he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand.”

Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor. She found him at the smithy. He was occupied in putting rusty nails into a bottle of ink, which he had obtained at the post office.

“Gammon? ha! HA!” said he, with his head on one side.

Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.

“Spinach? ha! HA!” said he, and accompanied her with alacrity.

He hopped so fast that Ribby had to run. It was most conspicuous. All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.

“I knew they would over-eat themselves!” said Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.

But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor—a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.

“How could I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!”

She got up and went to the table, and felt inside the pie-dish again with a spoon.

“No; there is no patty-pan, and I put one in; and nobody has eaten pie except me, so I must have swallowed it!”

She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate. The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!

Duchess started! She opened the door of the top oven;—out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie—and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!

Duchess drew a long breath—“Then I must have been eating Mouse!…No wonder I feel ill… But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!” Duchess reflected—“What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby! I think I will put my pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away.” She put it outside the back door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.

“Gammon, ha, HA?” said the doctor.

“I am feeling very much better,” said Duchess, waking up with a jump.

“I am truly glad to hear it! He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!”

“I think I should feel quite well if he only felt my pulse,” said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.

“It is only a bread-pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!”

“Gammon? Gammon?” said the doctor, while Duchess coughed and choked.

“Don't say that again!” said Ribby, losing her temper—“Here, take this bread and jam, and get out into the yard!”

“Gammon and spinach! ha ha HA!” shouted Dr. Maggotty triumphantly outside the back door…

“I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,” said Duchess. “Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?”

“Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess. I will lend you a nice warm shawl, and you shall take my arm.”

“I would not trouble you for worlds; I feel wonderfully better. One pill of Dr. Maggotty—”

“Indeed it is most admirable, if it has cured you of a patty-pan! I will call directly after breakfast to ask how you have slept.”

Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home. Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.

Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws. The jackdaws were eating pie-crust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.

“Gammon, ha, HA!” he shouted when he saw Duchess's little black nose peeping round the corner.

Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!

When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard. The patty-pan was under the pump, where Dr. Maggotty had considerately left it.

Ribby stared with amazement—“Did you ever see the like! so there really was a patty-pan?…But my patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard. Well I never did! … Next time I want to give a party—I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!”

THE END





THE TALE OF MR. JEREMY FISHER


Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.

The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage. But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!

He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond—

“I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner,” said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. “If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The Alderman, however, eats salad.”

Mr. Jeremy put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.

The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond. Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. “I know a good place for minnows,” said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.

Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it. Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.

The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.

“This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,” said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.

“I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,” said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.

A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes.

Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.

Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.

“I trust that is not a rat,” said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; “I think I had better get away from here.”

Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!

“A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!” cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod. But what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines! The stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water. And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher.

And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat—sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water—a much worse thing happened; a really frightful thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh!

A great big enormous trout came up—ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash—and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, “Ow! Ow! Ow!”—and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond! But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.

Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond. He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.

“What a mercy that was not a pike!” said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. “I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!” He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.

Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat. And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.

And instead of a nice dish of minnows—they had a roasted grasshopper with ladybird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but I think it must have been nasty!

THE END





THE STORY OF A FIERCE BAD RABBIT


This is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at his savage whiskers, and his claws and his turned-up tail.

This is a nice gentle Rabbit. His mother has given him a carrot.

The bad Rabbit would like some carrot. He doesn't say “Please.” He takes it! And he scratches the good Rabbit very badly.

The good Rabbit creeps away, and hides in a hole. It feels sad.

This is a man with a gun. He sees something sitting on a bench. He thinks it is a very funny bird. He comes creeping up behind the trees. And then he shoots—BANG!

This is what happens—But this is all he finds on the bench, when he rushes up with his gun.

The good Rabbit peeps out of its hole. And it sees the bad Rabbit tearing past—without any tail or whiskers!

THE END





THE STORY OF MISS MOPPET


This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!

This is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten.

This is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head. She thinks it is a very hard cupboard!

The Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.

Miss Moppet ties up her head in a duster, and sits before the fire.

The Mouse thinks she is looking very ill. He comes sliding down the bell-pull.

Miss Moppet looks worse and worse. The Mouse comes a little nearer.

Miss Moppet holds her poor head in her paws, and looks at him through a hole in the duster. The Mouse comes very close. And then all of a sudden—Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!

And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet—Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet. She ties him up in the duster, and tosses it about like a ball. But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it—there was no Mouse! He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on the top of the cupboard!

THE END





THE TALE OF TOM KITTEN


Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were—Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet. They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.

But one day their mother—Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit—expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived. First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet). Then she brushed their fur (this one is Mittens). Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten). Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.

Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas. Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. His mother sewed them on again.

When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.

“Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pig-stye and the Puddle-ducks.”

Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses. When they stood up there were several green smears!

“Let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall,” said Moppet.

They turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.

Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left. He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall. Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.

While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three Puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step—pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!

They stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised. Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.

Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.

“Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-duck,” said Moppet—“Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!”

Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles. But he put them on himself! They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.

“It's a very fine morning!” said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck. And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step—pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!

Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on. She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.

“My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,” said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit. She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true. Quite the contrary; they were not in bed; not in the least.

Somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea-party.

And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!

As for the Puddle-ducks—they went into a pond. The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons. And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.

THE END





THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK


What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!—Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.

Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else—“I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would let them go cold; you know you would!”

“I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,” quacked Jemima Puddle-duck. She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.

Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. She determined to make a nest right away from the farm. She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill. She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet. When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance. She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.

Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air. She flew beautifully when she had got a good start. She skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.

Jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. She rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves. But—seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper. He had black prick ears and sandy-coloured whiskers.

“Quack?” said Jemima Puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side—“Quack?”

The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima—

“Madam, have you lost your way?” said he. He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.

Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place.

“Ah! is that so? indeed!” said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima. He folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket.

Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.

“Indeed? how interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would teach it to mind its own business! But as to a nest—there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit there as long as you like,” said the bushy long-tailed gentleman. He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves.

It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.

“This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth—my winter house—so convenient,” said the hospitable gentleman.

There was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. The gentleman opened the door, and showed Jemima in. The shed was almost quite full of feathers—it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.

Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.

When she came out, the sandy-whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper—at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.

He was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day.

He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed. Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. They were greeny white and very large. The foxy gentleman admired them immensely. He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there.

At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day—“and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,” said the conscientious Jemima.

“Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats. But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat. Let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves! May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff—lard for the omelette,” said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.

Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious. She went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck. And she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.

The collie-dog Kep met her coming out, “What are you doing with those onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?”

Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.

The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers. He asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed. Then he went out, and trotted down the village. He went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.

Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag. She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.

He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.

“Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. Give me the herbs for the omelette. Be sharp!”

He was rather abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that. She felt surprised, and uncomfortable.

While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. Some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it. Jemima became much alarmed.

A moment afterwards there were most awful noises—barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans. And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.

Presently Kep opened the door of the shed, and let out Jemima Puddle-duck. Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them. He had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.

Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs. She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself; but only four of them hatched.

Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter.

THE END





THE TALE OF SAMUEL WHISKERS


Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!

On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard. She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.

Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.

It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night—especially cheese and bacon.

Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully.

While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief. The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out. They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire. They patted it with their little soft paws—“Shall we make dear little muffins?” said Mittens to Moppet. But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright. Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.

The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.

Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully—“Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,” said Tabitha, shedding tears. “I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him.” She wiped her eyes with her apron.

“He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?”

“All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to have an unruly family!” said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.

“I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too! What is all that soot in the fender?”

“The chimney wants sweeping—Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby—now Moppet and Mittens are gone!”

“They have both got out of the cupboard!”

Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.

“Yes, it is infested with rats,” said Tabitha tearfully, “I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat—an enormous old rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.”

“The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,” said Tabitha.

Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen.

They returned to the kitchen. “Here's one of your kittens at least,” said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.

They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She seemed to be in a terrible fright.

“Oh! Mother, Mother,” said Moppet, “there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!”

The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!

“Which way did she go, Moppet?”

But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.

Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search.

They went into the dairy. The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar. They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.

“Oh, Mother, Mother!” said Mittens—“Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy—a dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin.”

Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.

“A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!” exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.

“A rolling-pin?” said Ribby. “Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?”

Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.

“This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,” said Ribby. “We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw.”

Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.

Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide. He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.

The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fireplace.

The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat. He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs. Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.

Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; and he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below. He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.

“I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.”

The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth. The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.

Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up. Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little sweep himself.

It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another. There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost. He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some mutton bones lying about—

“This seems funny,” said Tom Kitten. “Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell? It is something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,” said Tom Kitten.

He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light. He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting-board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.

All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags. When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him—he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.

It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster. Opposite to him—as far away as he could sit—was an enormous rat.

“What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?” said the rat, chattering his teeth.

“Please, sir, the chimney wants sweeping,” said poor Tom Kitten.

“Anna Maria! Anna Maria!” squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.

All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening—His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.

Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.

“Anna Maria,” said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers)—“Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner.”

“It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,” said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.

“No,” said Samuel Whiskers, “make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs.”

“Nonsense! Butter and dough,” replied Anna Maria.

The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.

Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet anybody. He made a second journey for the rolling-pin. He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel. He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest. They did not see him.

Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough. She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws. She did not observe Moppet.

While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help. But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.

Except a spider who came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance. It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.

Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted. Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.

“Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?” inquired Samuel Whiskers.

Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry. She laid hold of his ears.

Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin went roly-poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.

“His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.”

“I fetched as much as I could carry,” replied Anna Maria.

“I do not think”—said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten—“I do not think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.”

Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above—the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!

The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.

“We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property—and other people's—and depart at once. I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding. But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary.”

“Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,” said Anna Maria. “I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney.”

So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up—there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling! But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet. Then he nailed the plank down again, and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.

The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner. The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts. They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.

John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheelbarrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.

And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon—I looked up the lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very like mine. They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.

Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones. She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.

I am sure I never gave her leave to borrow my wheelbarrow!

They went into the barn, and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the hay mow. After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.

As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags. And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers—children and grand-children and great great grand-children. There is no end to them!

Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers. They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very comfortably. They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught—dozens and dozens of them. But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than—A Mouse.

THE END





THE TALE OF THE FLOPSY BUNNIES


It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is “soporific.”

I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit. They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!

When Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful. I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the “Flopsy Bunnies.”

As there was not always quite enough to eat—Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden. Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare. When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.

Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two. One day—oh joy!—there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had “shot” into flower.

The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.

Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.

The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine. The bluebottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots (I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a wood-mouse with a long tail.). She rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny. The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.

While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies! Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot. The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific. They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.

Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them for some time. Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.

Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap—

“One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!” said he as he dropped them into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.

Mr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall. He went to put away the mowing machine. While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field. She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was? Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.

Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string. But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack. The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them. Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips. Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.

Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off. He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy. The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance. They watched him go into his house. And then they crept up to the window to listen.

Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it. They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle—

“One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!” said Mr. McGregor.

“Eh? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?” enquired Mrs. McGregor.

“One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!” repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers—“one, two, three—”

“Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?”

“In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!” replied Mr. McGregor.





(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)

Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel six, but they must be old rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.

“Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.”

“Line your old cloak?” shouted Mr. McGregor—“I shall sell them and buy myself baccy! Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.”

Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside. When she felt the vegetables, she became very very angry. She said that Mr. McGregor had “done it a purpose.” And Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny. It was rather hurt. Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.

So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.

But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.

THE END





THE TALE OF GINGER AND PICKLES


Once upon a time there was a village shop. The name over the window was “Ginger and Pickles.” It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls—Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles. The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket-handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings. They also sold sugar, and snuff and goloshes. In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything—except a few things that you want in a hurry—like bootlaces, hair-pins and mutton chops.

Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier. The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles. The shop was also patronized by mice—only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger. Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.

“I cannot bear,” said he, “to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels.”

“I have the same feeling about rats,” replied Pickles, “but it would never do to eat our customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's.”

“On the contrary, they would go nowhere,” replied Ginger gloomily.

(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not give credit.)

Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.

Now the meaning of “credit” is this—when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it—she says she will pay another time. And Pickles makes a low bow and says, “With pleasure, madam,” and it is written down in a book.

The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles. But there is no money in what is called the “till”.

The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints. But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.

As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods. Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock. They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed. `When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog licence.

“It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,” said Pickles.

“It is your own fault for being a terrier; I do not require a licence, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.”

“It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office,” said Pickles.“The place is full of policemen. I met one as I was coming home. Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon.”

“I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,” replied Ginger.

“And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things—Where are all the cream crackers?”

“You have eaten them yourself,” replied Ginger.

Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour. They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.

“Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October. What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?”

“Send in all the bills again to everybody ‘with compts’” replied Ginger.

After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!

Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.

“Bite him, Pickles! bite him!” spluttered Ginger behind a sugar-barrel, “he's only a German doll!”

The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.

Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice. He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches. At length on his last little rush—Pickles found that the shop was empty. The policeman had disappeared. But the envelope remained.

“Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid it is a summons,” said Pickles.

“No,” replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, “it is the rates and taxes, £ 3 19 11 3/4.”

“This is the last straw,” said Pickles, “let us close the shop.”

They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the neighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further.

Ginger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.

Pickles is at present a gamekeeper.

The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.

Of course there are the tradesmen's carts—the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker. But a person cannot live on “seed wigs” and sponge-cake and butter-buns—not even when the sponge-cake is as good as Timothy's!

After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles. But they did not keep “self-fitting sixes”; and it takes five mice to carry one seven-inch candle. Besides—the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather. And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.

And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but “very snug”; which is not the way to carry on a retail business.

So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to re-open the shop—“Henny's Opening Sale! Grand co-operative Jumble! Penny's penny prices! Come buy, come try, come buy!” The poster really was most 'ticing.

There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters. Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless. And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.

There is something to please everybody.

THE END





THE TALE OF MRS. TITTLEMOUSE


Once upon a time there was a wood-mouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse. She lived in a bank under a hedge. Such a funny house! There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge. There was a kitchen, a parlour, a pantry, and a larder. Also, there was Mrs. Tittlemouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!

Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.

Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.

“Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!” said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dust-pan.

And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.

“Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!”

Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.

“Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?”

“Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!”

She bundled the spider out at a window.

He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.

Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner. All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.

“I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge?

“I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet.”

Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble—“Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!” said the bumble bee. Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had a broom.

“Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and say Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?” Mrs. Tittlemouse began to get cross.

“Zizz, Wizz, Wizz!” replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.

Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty. But it was full of untidy dry moss. Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss. Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.

“I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!” said Mrs. Tittlemouse. “I will have them turned out—”

“Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!”—

“I wonder who would help me?”

“Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!”—

“I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet.”

Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner. When she got back to the parlour, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself! He was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender. He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.

“How do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!”

“Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I'll sit awhile and dry myself,” said Mr. Jackson. He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.

He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner? First she offered him cherry-stones. “Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!” said Mr. Jackson. He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.

Then she offered him thistle-down seed—

“Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff!” said Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle-down all over the room.

“Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what I really—really should like—would be a little dish of honey!”

“I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson,” said Mrs. Tittlemouse.

“Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!” said the smiling Mr. Jackson. “I can smell it; that is why I came to call.”

Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards. Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlour floor. When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.

“Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!”

“Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!”

First he squeezed into the pantry.

“Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?”

There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate-rack. Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught. Then he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.

“Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!”

“And without any invitation!” said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.

They went along the sandy passage—“Tiddly widdly—”

“Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!”

He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.

“I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles,” said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve.

“Get out, you nasty old toad!” shrieked Babbitty Bumble.

“I shall go distracted!” scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse. She shut herself up in the nut-cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.

When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out—everybody had gone away. But the untidiness was something dreadful—“Never did I see such a mess—smears of honey; and moss, and thistle-down—and marks of big and little dirty feet—all over my nice clean house!”

She gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax. Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.

“I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!”

She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.

“Will it ever be tidy again?” said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.

Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight. She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons. When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.

He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door. So they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended.

He sat outside in the sun, and said—“Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!”

THE END





THE TALE OF TIMMY TIPTOES


Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.

Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled—“Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring.”

Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch—“The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter.”

“Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring-time,” replied prudent Timothy.

When Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already.

Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.

Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.

When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled down—down—down inside.

“How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box!” said Goody.

“I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,” said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.

They did collect quantities—because they did not lose them!

Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.

The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to dig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other squirrels began to dig—the whole wood was in commotion!

Unfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.

The first one sang—“Who's bin digging-up my nuts? Who's-been-digging-up my nuts?”

And another sang—“Little bit-a-bread and-no-cheese! Little bit-a-bread an'-no-cheese!”

The squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang—“Who's-bin digging-up my nuts? Who's been digging-up my-nuts?”

Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer. It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all.

But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!

Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting—“Who's-been digging-up my-nuts?”

They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs. “We will leave him here till he confesses,” said Silvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole—“Who's-been-digging-up my-nuts?”

Timmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and still.

Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home. She made a cup of tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.

Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. Next morning she ventured back to the nut-bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away. She wandered all over the wood, calling—

“Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?”

In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurt him. There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better? It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the house was full of provisions.

The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree—“Besides, I found a few buried!” It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities—“But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself? My wife will be anxious!” “Just another nut—or two nuts; let me crack them for you,” said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!

Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.

“It is getting perfectly full-up downstairs; the sitting-room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?”

“I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here,” said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; “but where is Chippy Hackee? My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too.”

“I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me,” said Mrs. Chippy Hackee. She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.

Down below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin Chipmunk[1] voice were singing together—





“My little old man and I fell out,

How shall we bring this matter about?

Bring it about as well as you can,

And get you gone, you little old man!”





“You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,” said Goody Tiptoes. “Yes, I could,” said the Chipmunk, “but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!”

Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin Chipmunk[2] voice sang—





“For the diddlum day

Day diddle dum di!

Day diddle diddle dum day!”





Then Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down—“Timmy Tiptoes! Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!” And Timmy replied, “Is that you, Goody Tiptoes? Why, certainly!” He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he could not get out.

Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.

And so it went on for a fortnight; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain. Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella. But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable. At last a large bear came walking through the wood. Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.

Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry! And when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; and he was more uncomfortable still.

And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut-store fastened up with a little padlock.

And whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings—“Who's-been-digging-up my-nuts? Who's been digging-up my-nuts?” But nobody ever answers!

THE END

THE TALE OF MR. TOD


I have made many books about well-behaved people. Now, for a change, I am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.

Nobody could call Mr. Tod “nice”. The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.

One day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.

In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.

He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.

The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved out; because sometimes Tommy Brock moved in (without asking leave).

Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up. His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always went to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in, was generally Mr. Tod's.

Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.

Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years. He sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco. He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who had a young family. Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.

The little rabbit babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit-hole. To tell the truth—old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.

He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging, and some mole traps. He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them. And the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter—“I have not had a good square meal for a fortnight, I am living on pig-nuts. I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!” said Tommy Brock.

It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning. So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed-cake and “a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip wine.” Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit-hole with alacrity.

Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.

And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke . . .

When Flopsy and Benjamin came back—old Mr. Bouncer woke up. Tommy Brock and all the young rabbit babies had disappeared!

Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit-hole. But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.

Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock. There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his footmark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the way. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.

The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared; there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths—but the smell that made Benjamin stop, was not the smell of flowers!

Mr. Tod's stick house was before him; and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home. There was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it—there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.

Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring; his whiskers twitched. Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate, and said something. Benjamin stamped his foot, and bolted. He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently Tommy Brock had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall, there were again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.

Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow. He found another mole trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock. It was getting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air. One of them in a blue coat by himself, was busily hunting for dandelions—“Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!” shouted Benjamin Bunny.

The blue-coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears—

“Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?”

“No, no, no! He's bagged my family—Tommy Brock—in a sack—have you seen him?”

“Tommy Brock? How many, Cousin Benjamin?”

“Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way? Please tell me quick!”

“Yes, yes; not ten minutes since … he said they were caterpillars; I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars.”

“Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?”

“He had a sack with something 'live in it; I watched him set a mole trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning.” Benjamin did so.

“My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years,” said Peter reflectively, “but there are two hopeful circumstances. Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had refreshment. He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast.”

“Which way?”

“Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself. I know very well which way. Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick house he has gone to Mr. Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks. I partly know, because he offered to leave any message at Sister Cotton-tail's; he said he would be passing.”(Cotton-tail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on the hill.)

Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was all of a twitter. They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen. He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.

“He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent. What a nasty person!” said Peter.

The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Halfway up, Cotton-tail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half-grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.

Cotton-tail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice while she watched him. He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing—

“Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!” said Benjamin Bunny.

They climbed up and up—“He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole.”

“They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbours. Come on, Cousin Benjamin!”

When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously. The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a crag—Mr. Tod had made one of his homes. It was at the top of a steep bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it. The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.

This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumble-down pig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked. The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the kitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.

Benjamin sighed with relief. But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder. There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.

At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt-cellar, mustard and a chair—in short, preparations for one person's supper.

No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk. Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house. It was damp and smelly, and overgrown with thorns and briars. The rabbits shivered in their shoes.

“Oh my poor rabbit babies! What a dreadful place; I shall never see them again!” sighed Benjamin.

They crept up to the bedroom window. It was closed and bolted like the kitchen. But there were signs that this window had been recently open; the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the window-sill.

The room inside was so dark, that at first they could make out nothing; but they could hear a noise—a slow deep regular snoring grunt. And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket—“He has gone to bed in his boots,” whispered Peter. Benjamin, who was all of a twitter, pulled Peter off the window-sill.

Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed. Nothing could be seen of the young family.

The sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood. There were many unpleasant things lying about, that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. It was a shocking place, and very dark.

They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window. They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a light. They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.

In half an hour the moon rose over the wood. It shone full and clear and cold, upon the house amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window. But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!

The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie-dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor. The light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace—a little iron door belonging to a brick oven, of that old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood. And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window—the little door opposite shook in answer. The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!

Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed. But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery. They could not open the window; and although the young family was alive—the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not old enough to crawl.

After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel. They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank. They hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags.

They dug and dug for hours. They could not tunnel straight on account of stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor. Benjamin was on his back, scratching upwards. Peter's claws were worn down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. He called out that it was morning—sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods.

Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel, shaking the sand from his ears; he cleaned his face with his paws. Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill. In the valley there was a sea of white mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.

Again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jay—followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!

Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most foolish thing that they could have done. They rushed into their short new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's kitchen floor.

Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers. First he had been upset by breaking the plate. It was his own fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod. Then the midges had been very bad. And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled. Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.

As usual, when out of humour, he determined to move house. First he tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a dead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own. He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger. No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy Brock.

Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to. He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently. It flew from tree to tree and scolded, warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation. Once when it flew screaming over his head—Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.

He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key. He sniffed and his whiskers bristled. The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod had his doubts whether it was empty. He turned the rusty key in the lock; the rabbits below could hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.

The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious. There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie-dish, and his knife and fork and mustard and salt-cellar and his tablecloth that he had left folded up in the dresser—all set out for supper (or breakfast)—without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.

There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit. But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise—a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.

He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled and his coat-collar stood on end with rage.

For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house, and retreating hurriedly out again. By degrees he ventured further in—right into the bedroom. When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury. But when he was inside—he did not like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth. He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear. He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.

Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom. Twice he brought in his walking-stick, and once he brought in the coal-scuttle. But he thought better of it, and took them away. When he came back after removing the coal-scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep. He was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.

Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line. He stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.

Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window. It creaked; he turned round with a jump. Tommy Brock, who had opened one eye—shut it hastily. The snores continued.

Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather uneasy (because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom). He opened the window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window-sill. The rest of the line, with a hook at the end, remained in his hand.

Tommy Brock snored conscientiously. Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for a minute; then he left the room again. Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. There was a noise outside the window. Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.

Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the house. On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any idea who was inside it, he would have pulled them out quickly. His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin, but fortunately he thought that it was some more of Tommy Brock's work. He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and then tied the rope to a tree. Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window. He was puzzled.

Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.

Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.

Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook—hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.

Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead. His legs were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth. He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.

(Mr. Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house being unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a blanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper! It seemed as though nothing would waken him—not even the flapping rope across the bed.

Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again with the pail of water. He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window.

But naturally being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)—he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.

The snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.

Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug. The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over the head of Tommy Brock.

Surely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and up on the chair. As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once, he fetched a milk jug, and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never moved—except one eye.

At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete. The pail was full of water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across the window-sill to the tree outside.

“It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring-cleaning of some sort,” said Mr. Tod.

Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went out of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel. He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock—

“I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise,” said Mr. Tod.

The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also—grinning immensely. He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.

When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.

Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over. But no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened attentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.

In the middle of the bed under the blanket, was a wet flattened something—much dinged in, in the middle where the pail had caught it (as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was not snoring any longer. There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop drip of water trickling from the mattress.

Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened. Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved.

Yes—there was no doubt about it—it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!

“I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun,” said Mr. Tod. “I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a hot-water bottle. I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the smell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur.”

He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen—“First I will arrange the hole—then I will drag out that person in the blanket …”

He opened the door…

Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod's tea-pot into Mr. Tod's tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.

Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture. They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.

Inside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.

Everything was upset except the kitchen table. And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender. The crockery was smashed to atoms. The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers. The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the canisters fell off the shelf; the kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry jam. And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.

When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door. Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.

As soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out of the bushes—

“Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them! While I watch at the door.”

But Benjamin was frightened—

“Oh; oh! they are coming back!”

“No, they are not.”

“Yes, they are!”

“What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone quarry.”

Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him—

“Be quick, it's all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that he won't miss them.”





Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!

At home in the rabbit-hole, things had not been quite comfortable.

After quarrelling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit-hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The day passed heavily.

Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had been having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her feelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was wondering anxiously what she would do next.

In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amongst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.

“I've got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?”

Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.

Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks, half carrying half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty bump over the grass. They reached home safely, and burst into the rabbit-hole.

Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They soon recovered.

A long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.

Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner. Then Peter and Benjamin told their story—but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.

THE END





THE TALE OF PIGLING BLAND


Once upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes. She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-chin and Stumpy. Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.

The eight little pigs had very fine appetites—“Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they do eat!” said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride. Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck. Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.

Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten a piece of soap. And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig—“Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?” grunted Aunt Pettitoes.

Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig child was smutty black all over; when it had been popped into a tub, it proved to be Yock-yock.

I went into the garden; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots. I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears. Cross-patch tried to bite me.

“Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your family is not well brought up. Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland.”

“Yus, yus!” sighed Aunt Pettitoes. “And they drink bucketfuls of milk; I shall have to get another cow! Good little Spot shall stay at home to do the housework; but the others must go. Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether. Yus, yus, yus,” said Aunt Pettitoes, “there will be more to eat without them.”

So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheelbarrow, and Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross-patch rode away in a cart.

And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander, went to market. We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them good-bye in the yard.

Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket-handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot. Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows—

“Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling Bland, you must go to market. Take your brother Alexander by the hand. Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to blow your nose”—(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)—“beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs.” Pigling Bland, who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.

Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other—“Now son Alexander take the hand”—

“Wee, wee, wee!” giggled Alexander—

“take the hand of your brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market. Mind—”

“Wee, wee, wee!” interrupted Alexander again.

“You put me out,” said Aunt Pettitoes—“Observe sign-posts and milestones; do not gobble herring bones—”

“And remember,” said I impressively, “if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back. Alexander, you are not attending. Here are two licences permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire. Attend, Alexander. I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman.” Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.

I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper. Then they started.

Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile; at least Pigling Bland did. Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side. He danced about and pinched his brother, singing—





“This pig went to market,

this pig stayed at home,

This pig had a bit of meat—”





“Let's see what they have given us for dinner, Pigling?”

Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles. Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own peppermints—“Give me one of yours, please, Pigling?”

“But I wish to preserve them for emergencies,” said Pigling Bland doubtfully. Alexander went into squeals of laughter. Then he pricked Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling's pin, and the papers got mixed up. Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.

But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing—





“Tom, Tom, the piper's son,

stole a pig and away he ran!

But all the tune that he could play,

was ‘Over the hills and far away!’”





“What's that, young sirs? Stole a pig? Where are your licences?” said the policeman. They had nearly run against him round a corner. Pigling Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something crumply—

“To 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings—What's this? This ain't a licence?” Alexander's nose lengthened visibly, he had lost it. “I had one, indeed I had, Mr. Policeman!”

“It's not likely they let you start without. I am passing the farm. You may walk with me.”

“Can I come back too?” inquired Pigling Bland.

“I see no reason, young sir; your paper is all right.”

Pigling Bland did not like going on alone, and it was beginning to rain. But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.

To conclude the adventures of Alexander—the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea-time, followed by a damp subdued little pig. I disposed of Alexander in the neighbourhood; he did fairly well when he had settled down.

Pigling Bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to cross-roads and a sign-post—“To Market Town, 5 miles”, “Over the Hills, 4 miles”, “To Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles”.

Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander. He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the rain. He had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market, to be stared at, pushed, and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable—

“I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes,” said Pigling Bland. He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper—Alexander's! Pigling squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake Alexander and the policeman. He took a wrong turn—several wrong turns, and was quite lost.

It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.

Pigling Bland became frightened and cried “Wee, wee, wee! I can't find my way home!” After an hour's wandering he got out of the wood; the moon shone through the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him. The road crossed a moor; below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight, and beyond, in misty distance, lay the hills.

He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside—“I am afraid it is a hen house, but what can I do?” said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.

“Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs!” clucked a hen on a perch.

“Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!” scolded the disturbed cockerel. “To market, to market! jiggetty jig!” clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him. Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak. In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep.

In less than an hour they were all awakened. The owner, Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning. He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock; then his eye fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner. He made a singular remark—“Hallo, here's another!”—seized Pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper. Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland.

The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks. Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.

At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and Pigling was lifted out. He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.

“This one's come of himself, whatever,” said Mr. Piperson, turning Pigling's pockets inside out. He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots.

Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands. Mr. Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen. There was a smothered noise—“Shut up!” said Mr. Piperson. Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him.

Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise—“Be quiet, will ye?” said Mr. Piperson. Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.

Mr. Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge. It seemed to Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking, but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises.

Mr. Piperson poured out three platefuls: for himself, for Pigling, and a third—after glaring at Pigling—he put away with much scuffling, and locked up. Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.

After supper Mr. Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling's ribs; it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal. Besides, the hens had seen this pig. He looked at the small remains of a flitch, and then looked undecidedly at Pigling. “You may sleep on the rug,” said Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson.

Pigling Bland slept like a top. In the morning Mr. Piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer. He looked to see how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied—“You'll likely be moving on again?” said he to Pigling Bland.

Before Pigling could reply, a neighbour, who was giving Mr. Piperson and the hens a lift, whistled from the gate. Mr. Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or “I'll come back and skin ye!” said Mr. Piperson.

It crossed Pigling's mind that if he had asked for a lift, too, he might still have been in time for market. But he distrusted Peter Thomas.

After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the cottage; everything was locked up. He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen. Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket. He sang while he worked—





“Tom with his pipe made such a noise,

He called up all the girls and boys—

And they all ran to hear him play,

‘Over the hills and far away!’”





Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in—





“Over the hills and a great way off,

The wind shall blow my top knot off!”





Pigling Bland put down a plate which he was wiping, and listened.

After a long pause, Pigling went on tip-toe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen. There was nobody there.

After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard, and snuffed at the keyhole. It was quite quiet.

After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door. It was sucked in immediately.

In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all the remaining six peppermints.

When Mr. Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire; he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil; the meal was not get-at-able.

Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest. He did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it. He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.

Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper. All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke—“My name is Pig-wig. Make me more porridge, please!” Pigling Bland jumped, and looked round.

A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him. She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose. She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest—“How did you come here?” asked Pigling Bland.

“Stolen,” replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full. Pigling helped himself to meal without scruple.

“What for?”

“Bacon, hams,” replied Pig-wig cheerfully.

“Why on earth don't you run away?” exclaimed the horrified Pigling.

“I shall after supper,” said Pig-wig decidedly.

Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly. She finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she were going to start.

“You can't go in the dark,” said Pigling Bland.

Pig-wig looked anxious.

“Do you know your way by daylight?”

“I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river. Which way are you going, Mr. Pig?”

“To market—I have two pig papers. I might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection,” said Pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool. Pig-wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland. He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep. She became quiet, and there was a smell of peppermint.

“I thought you had eaten them,” said Pigling, waking suddenly.

“Only the corners,” replied Pig-wig, studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight.

“I wish you wouldn't; he might smell them through the ceiling,” said the alarmed Pigling.

Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; “Sing something,” she demanded.

“I am sorry . . . I have toothache,” said Pigling much dismayed.

“Then I will sing,” replied Pig-wig. “You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty? I have forgotten some of the words.”

Pigling Bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and watched her. She wagged her head and rocked about, clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice—





“A funny old mother pig lived in a stye,

and three little piggies had she;

(Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph, umph!

and the little pigs said, wee, wee!”





She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up—





“Those three little piggies grew peaky and lean,

and lean they might very well be;

For somehow they couldn't say umph, umph, umph!

and they wouldn't say wee, wee, wee!

For somehow they couldn't say—”





Pig-wig's head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little round ball, fast asleep on the hearthrug.

Pigling Bland, on tip-toe, covered her up with an antimacassar. He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.

Early in the morning, between dark and daylight, Pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up Pig-wig. She was excited and half-frightened. But it's dark! How can we find our way?”

“The cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might shout to Mr. Piperson.”

Pig-wig sat down again, and commenced to cry.

“Come away Pig-wig; we can see when we get used to it. Come! I can hear them clucking!”

Pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also he remembered the hamper. He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them. There was no garden; the neighbourhood of Mr. Piperson's was all scratched up by fowls. They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.

The sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills. The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards.

“That's Westmorland,” said Pig-wig. She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing—





“Tom, Tom, the piper's son,

stole a pig and away he ran!

“But all the tune that he could play,

was ‘Over the hills and far away!’”





“Come, Pig-wig, we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring.”

“Why do you want to go to market, Pigling?” inquired Pig-wig presently.

“I don't want; I want to grow potatoes.”

“Have a peppermint?” said Pig-wig. Pigling Bland refused quite crossly.

“Does your poor toothy hurt?” inquired Pig-wig. Pigling Bland grunted.

Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself, and followed the opposite side of the road. “Pig-wig! keep under the wall, there's a man ploughing.” Pig-wig crossed over, they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.

Suddenly Pigling stopped; he heard wheels.

Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman's cart. The reins flapped on the horse's back, the grocer was reading a newspaper.

“Take that peppermint out of your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have to run. Don't say one word. Leave it to me. And in sight of the bridge!” said poor Pigling, nearly crying. He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm.

The grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them, if his horse had not shied and snorted. He pulled the cart crossways, and held down his whip. “Hallo! Where are you going to?”—Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.

“Are you deaf? Are you going to market?” Pigling nodded slowly.

“I thought as much. It was yesterday. Show me your licence?”

Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse which had picked up a stone.

The grocer flicked his whip—“Papers? Pig licence?” Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers. The grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied. “This here pig, is a young lady; is her name Alexander?” Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.

The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper—“Lost, stolen or strayed, Ios. reward”; He looked suspiciously at Pig-wig. Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled for the ploughman.

“You wait here while I drive on and speak to him,” said the grocer, gathering up the reins. He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such a very lame pig could never run!

“Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back.” The grocer did so; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road. Then he looked over at his horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out, after he got to the ploughman.

“Now, Pig-wig, now!” said Pigling Bland.

Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran! They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge. Little fat Pig-wig's petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped.

They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes.

They came to the river, they came to the bridge—they crossed it hand in hand—then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!

Who brushed back his hair like a periwig—





He wore a sweet tie,

As blue as the sky—

And his whiskers and buttons

were very big.

THE TALE OF JOHNNY TOWN-MOUSE


Johnny Town-mouse was born in a cupboard. Timmy Willie was born in a garden. Timmy Willie was a little country mouse who went to town by mistake in a hamper. The gardener sent vegetables to town once a week by carrier; he packed them in a big hamper.

The gardener left the hamper by the garden gate, so that the carrier could pick it up when he passed. Timmy Willie crept in through a hole in the wickerwork, and after eating some peas—Timmy Willie fell fast asleep. He awoke in a fright, while the hamper was being lifted into the carrier's cart. Then there was a jolting, and a clattering of horse's feet; other packages were thrown in; for miles and miles—jolt—jolt—jolt! and Timmy Willie trembled amongst the jumbled up vegetables.

At last the cart stopped at a house, where the hamper was taken out, carried in, and set down. The cook gave the carrier sixpence; the back door banged, and the cart rumbled away. But there was no quiet; there seemed to be hundreds of carts passing. Dogs barked; boys whistled in the street; the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down stairs; and a canary sang like a steam engine.

Timmy Willie, who had lived all his life in a garden, was almost frightened to death. Presently the cook opened the hamper and began to unpack the vegetables. Out sprang the terrified Timmy Willie.

Up jumped the cook on a chair, exclaiming “A mouse! a mouse! Call the cat! Fetch me the poker, Sarah!” Timmy Willie did not wait for Sarah with the poker; he rushed along the skirting-board till he came to a little hole, and in he popped.

He dropped half a foot, and crashed into the middle of a mouse dinner party, breaking three glasses.—“who in the world is this?” inquired Johnny Town-mouse. But after the first exclamation of surprise he instantly recovered his manners. With the utmost politeness he introduced Timmy Willie to nine other mice, all with long tails and white neckties. Timmy Willie's own tail was insignificant. Johnny Town-mouse and his friends noticed it; but they were too well-bred to make personal remarks; only one of them asked Timmy Willie if he had ever been in a trap?

The dinner was of eight courses; not much of anything, but truly elegant. All the dishes were unknown to Timmy Willie, who would have been a little afraid of tasting them; only he was very hungry, and very anxious to behave with company manners. The continual noise upstairs made him so nervous, that he dropped a plate. “Never mind, they don't belong to us,” said Johnny. “Why don't those youngsters come back with the dessert?”

It should be explained that two young mice, who were waiting on the others, went skirmishing upstairs to the kitchen between courses. Several times they had come tumbling in, squeaking and laughing; Timmy Willie learnt with horror that they were being chased by the cat. His appetite failed, he felt faint.

“Try some jelly?” said Johnny Town-mouse. “No? Would you rather go to bed? I will show you a most comfortable sofa pillow.”

The sofa pillow had a hole in it. Johnny Town-mouse quite honestly recommended it as the best bed, kept exclusively for visitors. But the sofa smelt of cat. Timmy Willie preferred to spend a miserable night under the fender.

It was just the same next day. An excellent breakfast was provided—for mice accustomed to eat bacon; but Timmy Willie had been reared on roots and salad. Johnny Town-mouse and his friends racketted about under the floors, and came boldly out all over the house in the evening. One particularly loud crash had been caused by Sarah tumbling downstairs with the tea-tray; there were crumbs sand sugar and smears of jam to be collected, in spite of the cat.

Timmy Willie longed to be at home in his peaceful nest in a sunny bank. The food disagreed with him; the noise prevented him from sleeping. In a few days he grew so thin that Johnny Town-mouse noticed it, and questioned him. He listened to Timmy Willie's story and inquired about the garden. “It sounds rather a dull place? What do you do when it rains?”

“When it rains, I sit in my little sandy burrow and shell corn and seeds from my Autumn store. I peep out at the throstles and blackbirds on the lawn, and my friend Cock Robin. And when the sun comes out again, you should see my garden and the flowers—roses and pinks and pansies—no noise except the birds and bees, and the lambs in the meadows.”

“There goes that cat again!” exclaimed Johnny Town-mouse. When they had taken refuge in the coal-cellar he resumed the conversation; “I confess I am a little disappointed; we have endeavoured to entertain you, Timothy William.”

“Oh yes, yes, you have been most kind; but I do feel so ill,” said Timmy Willie.

“It may be that your teeth and digestion are unaccustomed to our food; perhaps it might be wiser for you to return in the hamper.”

“Oh? Oh!” cried Timmy Willie.

“Why of course for the matter of that we could have sent you back last week,” said Johnny rather huffily—“did you not know that the hamper goes back empty on Saturdays?”

So Timmy Willie said goodbye to his new friends, and hid in the hamper with a crumb of cake and a withered cabbage leaf; and after much jolting, he was set down safely in his own garden.

Sometimes on Saturdays he went to look at the hamper lying by the gate, but he knew better than to get in again. And nobody got out, though Johnny Town-mouse had half promised a visit.

The winter passed; the sun came out again; Timmy Willie sat by his burrow warming his little fur coat, and sniffing the smell of violets and spring grass. He had nearly forgotten his visit to town. When up the sandy path all spick and span with a brown leather bag came Johnny Town-mouse!

Timmy Willie received him with open arms. “You have come at the best of all the year, we will have herb pudding and sit in the sun.”

“H'm'm! it is a little damp,” said Johnny Town-mouse, who was carrying his tail under his arm, out of the mud.

“What is that fearful noise?” he started violently.

“That?” said Timmy Willie, “that is only a cow; I will beg a little milk, they are quite harmless, unless they happen to lie down upon you. How are all our friends?”

Johnny's account was rather middling. He explained why he was paying his visit so early in the season; the family had gone to the seaside for Easter; the cook was doing spring cleaning, on board wages, with particular instructions to clear out the mice. There were four kittens, and the cat had killed the canary.

“They say we did it; but I know better,” said Johnny Town-mouse.“Whatever is that fearful racket?”

“That is only the lawnmower; I will fetch some of the grass clippings presently to make your bed. I am sure you had better settle in the country, Johnny.”

“H'm'm—we shall see by Tuesday week; the hamper is stopped while they are at the seaside.”

“I am sure you will never want to live in town again,” said Timmy Willie.

But he did. He went back in the very next hamper of vegetables; he said it was too quiet!

One place suits one person, another place suits another person. For my part, I prefer to live in the country, like Timmy Willie.

THE TALE OF LITTLE PIG ROBINSON


Chapter One


When I was a child I used to go to the seaside for the holidays. We stayed in a little town where there was a harbour and fishing boats and fishermen. They sailed away to catch herrings in nets. When the boats came back home again, some had only caught a few herrings. Others had caught so many that they could not all be unloaded on to the quay. Then horses and carts were driven into the shallow water at low tide to meet the heavily laden boats. The fish were shovelled over the side of the boat into the carts, and taken to the railway station, where a special train of fish trucks was waiting.

Great was the excitement when the fishing boats returned with a good catch of herrings. Half the people in the town ran down to the quay, including cats.

There was a white cat called Susan who never missed meeting the boats. She belonged to the wife of an old fisherman named Sam. The wife's name was Betsy. She had rheumatics, and she had no family except Susan and five hens. Betsy sat by the fire; her back ached; she said “Ow! Ow!” whenever she had to put coal on, and stir the pot. Susan sat opposite to Betsy. She felt sorry for Betsy; she wished she knew how to put the coal on and stir the pot. All day long they sat by the fire, while Sam was away fishing. They had a cup of tea and some milk. “Susan,” said Betsy, “I can hardly stand up. Go to the front gate and look out for Master's boat.”

Susan went out and came back. Three or four times she went out into the garden. At last, late in the afternoon, she saw the sails of the fishing fleet, coming in over the sea.

“Go down to the harbour; ask Master for six herrings; I will cook them for supper. Take my basket, Susan.”

Susan took the basket; also she borrowed Betsy's bonnet and little plaid shawl. I saw her hurrying down to the harbour.

Other cats were coming out of the cottages, and running down the steep streets that lead to the sea front. Also ducks. I remember that they were most peculiar ducks with top-knots that looked like tam-o'-shanter caps. Everybody was hurrying to meet the boats—nearly everybody. I only met one person, a dog called Stumpy, who was going the opposite way. He was carrying a paper parcel in his mouth.

Some dogs do not care for fish. Stumpy had been to the butcher's to buy mutton chops for himself and Bob and Percy and Miss Rose. Stumpy was a large, serious, well-behaved brown dog with a short tail. He lived with Bob the retriever and Percy the cat and Miss Rose who kept house. Stumpy had belonged to a very rich old gentleman; and when the old gentleman died he left money to Stumpy—ten shillings a week for the rest of Stumpy's life. So that was why Stumpy and Bob and Percy the cat all lived together in a pretty little house.

Susan with her basket met Stumpy at the corner of Broad Street. Susan made a curtsy. She would have stopped to inquire after Percy, only she was in a hurry to meet the boat. Percy was lame; he had hurt his foot. It had been trapped under the wheel of a milk cart.

Stumpy looked at Susan out of the corner of his eye; he wagged his tail, but he did not stop. He could not bow or say “good afternoon” for fear of dropping the parcel of mutton chops. He turned out of Broad Street into Woodbine Lane, where he lived; he pushed open the front door and disappeared into a house. Presently there was a smell of cooking, and I have no doubt that Stumpy and Bob and Miss Rose enjoyed their mutton chops.

Percy could not be found at dinner-time. He had slipped out of the window, and, like all the other cats in the town, he had gone to meet the fishing boats.

Susan hurried along Broad Street and took the short cut to the harbour, down a steep flight of steps. The ducks had wisely gone another way, round by the sea front. The steps were too steep and slippery for anyone less sure-footed than a cat. Susan went down quickly and easily. There were forty-three steps, rather dark and slimy, between high backs of houses.

A smell of ropes and pitch and a good deal of noise came up from below. At the bottom of the steps was the quay, or landing place, beside the inner harbour.

The tide was out; there was no water; the vessels rested on the dirty mud. Several ships were moored beside the quay; others were anchored inside the breakwater.

Near the steps, coal was being unloaded from two grimy colliers called the “Margery Dawe” of Sunderland, and the “Jenny Jones” of Cardiff. Men ran along planks with wheelbarrowfuls of coal; coal scoops were swung ashore by cranes, and emptied with loud thumping and rattling.

Farther along the quay, another ship called the “Pound of Candles” was taking a mixed cargo on board. Bales, casks, packing-cases, barrels—all manner of goods were being stowed into the hold; sailors and stevedores shouted; chains rattled and clanked. Susan waited for an opportunity to slip past the noisy crowd. She watched a cask of cider that bobbed and swung in the air, on its passage from the quay to the deck of the “Pound of Candles”. A yellow cat who sat in the rigging was also watching the cask.

The rope ran through the pulley; the cask went down bobbitty on to the deck, where a sailor man was waiting for it. Said the sailor down below—

“Look out! Mind your head, young sir! Stand out of the way!”

“Wee, wee, wee!” grunted a small pink pig, scampering round the deck of the “Pound of Candles”.

The yellow cat in the rigging watched the small pink pig. The yellow cat in the rigging looked across at Susan on the quay. The yellow cat winked.

Susan was surprised to see a pig on board a ship. But she was in a hurry. She threaded her way along the quay, amongst coal and cranes, and men wheeling hand-trucks, and noises, and smells. She passed the fish auction, and fish boxes, and fish sorters, and barrels that women were filling with herrings and salt.

Seagulls swooped and screamed. Hundreds of fish boxes and tons of fresh fish were being loaded into the hold of a small steamer. Susan was glad to get away from the crowd, down a much shorter flight of steps on to the shore of the outer harbour. The ducks arrived soon afterwards, waddling and quacking. And old Sam's boat, the “Betsy Timmins”, last of the herring fleet and heavy laden, came in round the breakwater; and drove her blunt nose into the shingle.

Sam was in high spirits; he had had a big catch. He and his mate and two lads commenced to unload their fish into carts, as the tide was too low to float the fishing boat up to the quay. The boat was full of herrings.

But, good luck or bad luck, Sam never failed to throw a handful of herrings to Susan.

“Here's for the two old girls and a hot supper! Catch them, Susan! Honest now! Here's a broken fish for you! Now take the others to Betsy.”

The ducks were dabbling and gobbling; the seagulls were screaming and swooping. Susan climbed the steps with her basket of herrings and went home by back streets.

Old Betsy cooked two herrings for herself and Susan, another two for Sam's supper when he came in. Then she went to bed with a hot bottle wrapped in a flannel petticoat to help her rheumatics.

Sam ate his supper and smoked a pipe by the fire; and then he went to bed. But Susan sat a long time by the fire, considering. She considered many things—fish, and ducks, and Percy with a lame foot, and dogs that eat mutton chops, and the yellow cat on the ship, and the pig. Susan thought it strange to see a pig upon a ship called the “Pound of Candles”. The mice peeped out under the cupboard door. The cinders fell together on the hearth. Susan purred gently in her sleep and dreamed of fish and pigs. She could not understand that pig on board a ship. But I know all about him!





Chapter Two


You remember the song about the Owl and the Pussy Cat and their beautiful pea-green boat? How they took some honey and plenty of money, wrapped up in a five pound note?





They sailed away, for a year and a day,

To the land where the Bong tree grows—

And, there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood,

With a ring at the end of his nose—his nose,

With a ring at the end of his nose.





Now I am going to tell you the story of that pig, and why he went to live in the land of the Bong tree.

When that pig was little he lived in Devonshire, with his aunts, Miss Dorcas and Miss Porcas, at a farm called Piggery Porcombe. Their cosy thatched cottage was in an orchard at the top of a steep red Devonshire lane.

The soil was red, the grass was green; and far away below in the distance they could see red cliffs and a bit of bright blue sea. Ships with white sails sailed over the sea into the harbour of Stymouth.

I have often remarked that the Devonshire farms have very strange names. If you had ever seen Piggery Porcombe you would think that the people who lived there were very queer too! Aunt Dorcas was a stout speckled pig who kept hens. Aunt Porcas was a large smiling black pig who took in washing. We shall not hear very much about them in this story. They led prosperous uneventful lives, and their end was bacon. But their nephew Robinson had the most peculiar adventures that ever happened to a pig.

Little pig Robinson was a charming little fellow; pinky white with small blue eyes, fat cheeks and a double chin, and a turned-up nose, with a real silver ring in it. Robinson could see that ring if he shut one eye and squinted sideways.

He was always contented and happy. All day long he ran about the farm, singing little songs to himself, and grunting “Wee, wee, wee!” His aunts missed those little songs sadly after Robinson had left them.

“Wee? Wee? Wee?” he answered when anybody spoke to him. “Wee? Wee? Wee?” listening with his head on one side and one eye screwed up.

Robinson's old aunts fed him and petted him and kept him on the trot.

“Robinson! Robinson!” called Aunt Dorcas. “Come quick! I hear a hen clucking. Fetch me the egg; don't break it now!”

“Wee, wee, wee!” answered Robinson, like a little Frenchman.

“Robinson! Robinson! I've dropped a clothes peg, come and pick it up for me!” called Aunt Porcas from the drying green (she being almost too fat to stoop down and pick up anything).

“Wee, wee, wee!” answered Robinson.

Both the aunts were very, very stout. And the stiles in the neighbourhood of Stymouth are narrow. The footpath from Piggery Porcombe crosses many fields; a red trodden track between short green grass and daisies. And wherever the footpath crosses over from one field to another field, there is sure to be a stile in the hedge.

“It is not me that is too stout; it is the stiles that are too thin,” said Aunt Dorcas to Aunt Porcas. “Could you manage to squeeze through them if I stayed at home?”

“I could not. Not for two years I could not,” replied Aunt Porcas.“Aggravating, it is aggravating of that carrier man, to go and upset his donkey cart the day before market day. And eggs at two and tuppence a dozen! How far do you call it to walk all the way round by the road instead of crossing the fields?”

“Four miles if it's one,” sighed Aunt Porcas, “and me using my last bit of soap. However will we get our shopping done? The donkey says the cart will take a week to mend.”

“Don't you think you could squeeze through the stiles if you went before dinner?”

“No, I don't, I would stick fast; and so would you,” said Aunt Porcas.

“Don't you think we might venture—” commenced Aunt Dorcas.

“Venture to send Robinson by the footpath to Stymouth?” finished Aunt Porcas.

“Wee, wee, wee!” answered Robinson.

“I scarcely like to send him alone, though he is sensible for his size.”

“Wee, wee, wee!” answered Robinson.

“But there is nothing else to be done,” said Aunt Dorcas.

So Robinson was popped into the wash-tub with the last bit of soap. He was scrubbed and dried and polished as bright as a new pin. Then he was dressed in a little blue cotton frock and knickers, and instructed to go shopping to Stymouth with a big market basket.

In the basket were two dozen eggs, a bunch of daffodils, two spring cauliflowers; also Robinson's dinner of bread-and-jam sandwiches. The eggs and flowers and vegetables he must sell in the market, and bring back various other purchases from shopping.

“Now take care of yourself in Stymouth, Nephew Robinson. Beware of gunpowder, and ships' cooks, and pantechnicons, and sausages, and shoes, and ships, and sealing-wax. Remember the blue bag, the soap, the darning wool—what was the other thing?” said Aunt Dorcas.

“The darning wool, the soap, the blue bag, the yeast—what was the other thing?” said Aunt Porcas.

“Wee, wee, wee!” answered Robinson.

“The blue bag, the soap, the yeast, the darning wool, the cabbage seed—that's five, and there ought to be six. It was two more than four because it was two too many to tie knots in the corners of his hankie, to remember by. Six to buy, it should be—”

“I have it!” said Aunt Porcas. “It was tea—tea, blue bag, soap, darning wool, yeast, cabbage seed. You will buy most of them at Mr. Mumby's. Explain about the carrier, Robinson; tell him we will bring the washing and some more vegetables next week.”

“Wee, wee, wee” answered Robinson, setting off with the big basket.

Aunt Dorcas and Aunt Porcas stood in the porch. They watched him safely out of sight, down the field, and through the first of the many stiles. When they went back to their household tasks they were grunty and snappy with each other, because they were uneasy about Robinson.

“I wish we had not let him go. You and your tiresome blue bag!” said Aunt Dorcas.

“Blue bag, indeed! It was your darning wool and eggs!” grumbled Aunt Porcas. “Bother that carrier man and his donkey cart! Why could not he keep out of the ditch until after market day?”





Chapter Three


The walk to Stymouth was a long one, in spite of going by the fields. But the footpath ran downhill all the way, and Robinson was merry. He sang his little song, for joy of the fine morning, and he chuckled “Wee, wee, wee!” Larks were singing, too, high overhead.

And higher still—high up against blue sky, the great white gulls sailed in wide circles. Their hoarse cries came softened back to earth from a great way up above. Important rooks and lively jackdaws strutted about the meadows amongst the daisies and buttercups. Lambs skipped and baa'ed; the sheep looked round at Robinson.

“Mind yourself in Stymouth, little pig,” said a motherly ewe.

Robinson trotted on until he was out of breath and very hot. He had crossed five big fields, and ever so many stiles; stiles with steps; ladder stiles; stiles of wooden posts; some of them were very awkward with a heavy basket. The farm of Piggery Porcombe was no longer in sight when he looked back. In the distance before him, beyond the farmlands and cliffs—never any nearer—the dark blue sea rose like a wall.

Robinson sat down to rest beside a hedge in a sheltered sunny spot. Yellow pussy willow catkins were in flower above his head; there were primroses in hundreds on the bank, and a warm smell of moss and grass and steaming moist red earth.

“If I eat my dinner now, I will not have to carry it. Wee, wee, wee!” said Robinson.

The walk had made him so hungry; he would have liked to eat an egg as well as the jam sandwiches; but he had been too well brought up. “It would spoil the two dozen,” said Robinson.

He picked a bunch of primroses and tied them up with a bit of darning wool that Aunt Dorcas had given him for a pattern. “I will sell them in the market for my very own self, and buy sweeties with my pennies. How many pennies have I got?” said Robinson, feeling in his pocket. “One from Aunt Dorcas, and one from Aunt Porcas, and one for my primroses for my very own self—oh, wee, wee, wee! There is somebody trotting along the road! I shall be late for market!”

Robinson jumped up and pushed his basket through a very narrow stile, where the footpath crossed into the public road. He saw a man on horseback. Old Mr. Pepperil came up, riding a chestnut horse with white legs. His two tall greyhounds ran before him; they looked through the bars of the gates into every field that they passed. They came bounding up to Robinson, very large and friendly; they licked his face and asked what he had got in that basket. Mr. Pepperil called them.

“Here, Pirate! Here, Postboy! Come here, sir!” He did not wish to be answerable for the eggs.

The road had been recently covered with sharp new flints. Mr. Pepperil walked the chestnut horse on the grass edge, and talked to Robinson. He was a jolly old gentleman, very affable, with a red face and white whiskers. All the green fields and red ploughland between Stymouth and Piggery Porcombe belonged to him.

“Hullo, hullo! And where are you off to, little pig Robinson?”

“Please, Mr. Pepperil, sir, I'm going to market. Wee, wee, wee!” said Robinson.

“What, all by yourself? Where are Miss Dorcas and Miss Porcas? Not ill, I trust?”

Robinson explained about the narrow stiles.

“Dear, dear! Too fat, too fat? So you are going all alone? Why don't your aunts keep a dog to run errands?”

Robinson answered all Mr. Pepperil's questions very sensibly and prettily. He showed much intelligence, and quite a good knowledge of vegetables, for one so young. He trotted along almost under the horse, looking up at its shiny chestnut coat, and the broad white girth, and Mr. Pepperil's gaiters and brown leather boots. Mr. Pepperil was pleased with Robinson; he gave him another penny. At the end of the flints, he gathered up the reins and touched the horse with his heel.

“Well, good day, little pig. Kind regards to the aunts. Mind yourself in Stymouth.” He whistled for his dogs, and trotted away.

Robinson continued to walk along the road. He passed by an orchard where seven thin dirty pigs were grubbing. They had no silver rings in their noses! He crossed Styford bridge without stopping to look over the parapet at the little fishes, swimming head up stream, balanced in the sluggish current; or the white ducks that dabbled amongst floating masses of water-crowsfoot. At Styford Mill he called to leave a message from Aunt Dorcas to the Miller about meal; the Miller's wife gave him an apple.

At the house beyond the mill, there is a big dog that barks; but the big dog Gypsy only smiled and wagged his tail at Robinson. Several carts and gigs overtook him. First, two old farmers who screwed themselves round to stare at Robinson. They had two geese, a sack of potatoes, and some cabbages, sitting on the back seat of their gig. Then an old woman passed in a donkey cart with seven hens, and long pink bundles of rhubarb that had been grown in straw under apple barrels. Then with a rattle and a jingle of cans came Robinson's cousin, little Tom Pigg, driving a strawberry roan pony, in a milk float. He might have offered Robinson a lift, only he happened to be going in the opposite direction; in fact, the strawberry roan pony was running away home.

“This little pig went to market!” shouted little Tom Pigg gaily, as he rattled out of sight in a cloud of dust, leaving Robinson standing in the road.

Robinson walked on along the road, and presently he came to another stile in the opposite hedge, where the footpath followed the fields again. Robinson got his basket through the stile. For the first time he felt some apprehension. In this field there were cows; big sleek Devon cattle, dark red like their native soil. The leader of the herd was a vicious old cow, with brass balls screwed on to the tips of her horns. She stared disagreeably at Robinson. He sidled across the meadow and got out through the farther stile as quickly as he could. Here the new trodden footpath followed round the edge of a crop of young green wheat. Someone let off a gun with a bang that made Robinson jump and cracked one of Aunt Dorcas's eggs in the basket.

A cloud of rooks and jackdaws rose cawing and scolding from the wheat. Other sounds mingled with their cries; noises of the town of Stymouth that began to come in sight through the elm trees that bordered the fields; distant noises from the station; whistling of an engine; the bump of trucks shunting; noise of workshops; the hum of a distant town; the hooter of a steamer entering the harbour. High overhead came the hoarse cry of the gulls, and the squabbling cawing of rooks, old and young, in their rookery up in the elm trees.

Robinson left the fields for the last time and joined a stream of country people on foot and in carts, all going to Stymouth Market.





Chapter Four


Stymouth is a pretty little town, situated at the mouth of the river Pigsty, whose sluggish waters slide gently into a bay sheltered by high red headlands. The town itself seems to be sliding downhill in a basin of hills, all slipping seaward into Stymouth harbour, which is dammed back by quays and the outer breakwater.

The outskirts of the town are untidy, as is frequently the case with seaports. A straggling suburb on the western approach is inhabited principally by goats, and persons who deal in old iron, rags, tarred rope, and fishing nets. There are rope walks, and washing that flaps on waggling lines above banks of stony shingle, littered with seaweed, whelk shells and dead crabs—very different from Aunt Porcas's clothes lines over the clean green grass.

And there are marine stores that sell spy-glasses, and sou'westers, and onions; and there are smells; and curious high sheds, shaped like sentry boxes, where they hang up herring nets to dry; and loud talking inside dirty houses. It seemed a likely place to meet a pantechnicon. Robinson kept in the middle of the road. Somebody in a public-house shouted at him through the window, “Come in, fat pig!” Robinson took to his heels.

The town of Stymouth itself is clean, pleasant, picturesque, and well-behaved (always excepting the harbour); but it is extremely steep downhill. If Robinson had started one of Aunt Dorcas's eggs rolling at the top of High Street, it would have rolled all the way down to the bottom; only it would have got broken certainly against a doorstep, or underfoot. There were crowds in the streets, as it was market day.

Indeed, it was difficult to walk about without being pushed off the pavement; every old woman that Robinson met seemed to have a basket as big as his own. In the roadway were fish barrows, apple barrows, stalls with crockery and hardware, cocks and hens riding in pony carts, donkeys with panniers, and farmers with wagon-loads of hay. Also there was a constant string of coal carts coming up from the docks. To a country-bred pig, the noise was confusing and fearful.

Robinson kept his head very creditably until he got into Fore Street, where a drover's dog was trying to turn three bullocks into a yard, assisted by Stumpy and half the other dogs of the town. Robinson and two other little pigs with baskets of asparagus bolted down an alley and hid in a doorway until the noise of bellowing and barking had passed.

When Robinson took courage to come out again into Fore Street, he decided to follow close behind the tail of a donkey who was carrying panniers piled high with spring broccoli. There was no difficulty in guessing which road led to market. But after all these delays it was not surprising that the church clock struck eleven.

Although it had been open since ten, there were still plenty of customers buying, and wanting to buy, in the market hall. It was a large, airy, light, cheerful, covered-in place, with glass in the roof. It was crowded, but safe and pleasant, compared with the jostling and racket outside in the cobble-paved streets; at all events there was no risk of being run over. There was a loud hum of voices; market folk cried their wares; customers elbowed and pushed round the stalls. Dairy produce, vegetables, fish, and shell fish were displayed upon the flat boards on trestles.

Robinson had found a standing place at one end of a stall where Nanny Nettigoat was selling periwinkles.

“Winkle, winkle! Wink, wink, wink! Maa, maa-a!” bleated Nanny. Winkles were the only thing that she offered for sale, so she felt no jealousy of Robinson's eggs and primroses. She knew nothing about his cauliflowers; he had the sense to keep them in the basket under the table. He stood on an empty box, quite proud and bold behind the trestle table, singing—

“Eggs, new laid! Fresh new-laid eggs! Who'll come and buy my eggs and daffodillies?”

“I will, sure,” said a large brown dog with a stumpy tail, “I'll buy a dozen. My Miss Rose has sent me to market on purpose to buy eggs and butter.”

“I am so sorry, I have no butter, Mr. Stumpy; but I have beautiful cauliflowers,” said Robinson, lifting up the basket, after a cautious glance round at Nanny Nettigoat, who might have tried to nibble them. She was busy measuring periwinkles in a pewter mug for a duck customer in a tam-o'-shanter cap. “They are lovely brown eggs, except one that got cracked; I think that white pussy cat at the opposite stall is selling butter—they are beautiful cauliflowers.”

“I'll buy a cauliflower, lovey, bless his little turned-up nose; did he grow them in his own garden?” said old Betsy, bustling up; her rheumatism was better; she had left Susan to keep house. “No, lovey, I don't want any eggs; I keep hens myself. A cauliflower and a bunch of daffodils for a bow-pot, please,” said Betsy.

“Wee, wee, wee!” replied Robinson.

“Here, Mrs. Perkins, come here! Look at this little pig stuck up at a stall all by himself!”

“Well, I don't know!” exclaimed Mrs. Perkins, pushing through the crowd, followed by two little girls. “Well, I never! Are they quite new laid, sonny? Won't go off pop and spoil my Sunday dress like the eggs Mrs. Wyandotte took first prize with at five flower shows, till they popped and spoiled the judge's black silk dress? Not duck eggs, stained with coffee? That's another trick of flower shows! New laid, guaranteed? Only you say one is cracked? Now I call that real honest; it's no worse for frying. I'll have the dozen eggs and a cauliflower, please. Look, Sarah Polly! Look at his silver nose-ring.”

Sarah Polly and her little girl friend went into fits of giggling, so that Robinson blushed. He was so confused that he did not notice a lady who wanted to buy his last cauliflower, till she touched him. There was nothing else left to sell, but a bunch of primroses. After more giggling and some whispering the two little girls came back, and bought the primroses. They gave him a peppermint, as well as the penny, which Robinson accepted; but without enthusiasm and with a preoccupied manner.

The trouble was that no sooner had he parted with the bunch of primroses than he realised that he had also sold Aunt Dorcas's pattern of darning wool. He wondered if he ought to ask for it back; but Mrs. Perkins and Sarah Polly and her little girl friend had disappeared.

Robinson, having sold everything, came out of the market hall, sucking the peppermint. There were still numbers of people coming in. As Robinson came out upon the steps his basket got caught in the shawl of an elderly sheep, who was pushing her way up. While Robinson was disentangling it, Stumpy came out. He had finished his marketing. His basket was full of heavy purchases. A responsible, trustworthy, obliging dog was Stumpy, glad to do a kindness to anybody.

When Robinson asked him the way to Mr. Mumby's, Stumpy said: “I am going home by Broad Street. Come with me, and I will show you.”

“Wee, wee, wee! Oh, thank you, Stumpy!” said Robinson.





Chapter Five


Old Mr. Mumby was a deaf old man in spectacles, who kept a general store. He sold almost anything you can imagine, except ham—a circumstance much approved by Aunt Dorcas. It was the only general store in Stymouth where you would not find displayed upon the counter a large dish, containing strings of thin, pale-coloured, repulsively uncooked sausages, and rolled bacon hanging from the ceiling.

“What pleasure,” said Aunt Dorcas feelingly—“what possible pleasure can there be in entering a shop where you knock your head against a ham? A ham that may have belonged to a dear second cousin?”

Therefore the aunts bought their sugar and tea, their blue bag, their soap, their frying pans, matches, and mugs from old Mr. Mumby. All these things he sold, and many more besides, and what he did not keep in stock he would obtain to order. But yeast requires to be quite fresh, he did not sell it; he advised Robinson to ask for yeast at a baker's shop. Also he said it was too late in the season to buy cabbage seed; everybody had finished sowing vegetable seeds this year. Worsted for darning he did sell; but Robinson had forgotten the colour.

Robinson bought six sticks of delightfully sticky barley sugar with his pennies, and listened carefully to Mr. Mumby's messages for Aunt Dorcas and Aunt Porcas—how they were to send some cabbages next week when the donkey cart would be mended; and how the kettle was not repaired yet, and there was a new patent box-iron he would like to recommend to Aunt Porcas.

Robinson said “Wee, wee, wee?” and listened, and little dog Tipkins who stood on a stool behind the counter, tying up grocery parcels in blue paper bags—little dog Tipkins whispered to Robinson—“Were there any rats this spring in the barn at Piggery Porcombe? And what would Robinson be doing on Saturday afternoon?”

“Wee, wee, wee!” answered Robinson.

Robinson came out of Mr. Mumby's, heavily laden. The barley sugar was comforting; but he was troubled about the darning wool, the yeast, and the cabbage seed. He was looking about rather anxiously, when again he met old Betsy, who exclaimed:

“Bless the little piggy! Not gone home yet? Now it must not stop in Stymouth till it gets its pocket picked!”

Robinson explained his difficulty about the darning wool. Kind old Betsy was ready with help. “Why, I noticed the wool round the little primrose posy; it was blue-grey colour like the last pair of socks that I knitted for Sam. Come with me to the wool shop—Fleecy Flock's wool shop. I remember the colour; well I do!” said Betsy.

Mrs. Flock was the sheep that had run against Robinson; she had bought herself three turnips and come straight home from market, for fear of missing customers while her shop was locked up.

Such a shop! Such a jumble! Wool all sorts of colours, thick wool, thin wool, fingering wool, and rug wool, bundles and bundles all jumbled up; and she could not put her hoof on anything. She was so confused and slow at finding things that Betsy got impatient.

“No, I don't want wool for slippers; darning wool, Fleecy; darning wool, same colour as I bought for my Sam's socks. Bless me, no, not knitting needles! Darning wool.”

“Baa, baa! Did you say white or black, m'm? Three ply, was it?”

“Oh, dear me, grey darning wool on cards; not heather mixture.”

“I know I have it somewhere,” said Fleecy Flock helplessly, jumbling up the skeins and bundles. “Sim Ram came in this morning with part of the Ewehampton clip; my shop is completely cluttered up—” It took half an hour to find the wool. If Betsy had not been with him, Robinson never would have got it.

“It's that late, I must go home,” said Betsy. “My Sam is on shore today for dinner. If you take my advice you will leave that big heavy basket with the Miss Goldfinches, and hurry with your shopping. It's a long uphill walk home to Piggery Porcombe.”

Robinson, anxious to follow old Betsy's advice, walked towards the Miss Goldfinches'. On the way he came to a baker's, and he remembered the yeast. It was not the right sort of baker's, unfortunately. There was a nice bakery smell, and pastry in the window; but it was an eating house or cook shop.

When he pushed the swing door open, a man in an apron and a square white cap turned round and said, “Hullo! Is this a pork pie walking on its hind legs?”—and four rude men at a dining table burst out laughing.

Robinson left the shop in a hurry. He felt afraid to go into any other baker's shop. He was looking wistfully into another window in Fore Street when Stumpy saw him again. He had taken his own basket home, and come out on another errand. He carried Robinson's basket in his mouth and took him to a very safe baker's, where he was accustomed to buy dog biscuits for himself. There Robinson purchased Aunt Dorcas's yeast at last.

They searched in vain for cabbage seed; they were told that the only likely place was a little store on the quay, kept by a pair of wagtails.

“It is a pity I cannot go with you,” said Stumpy. “My Miss Rose has sprained her ankle; she sent me to fetch twelve postage stamps, and I must take them home to her, before the post goes out. Do not try to carry this heavy basket down and up the steps; leave it with the Miss Goldfinches.”

Robinson was very grateful to Stumpy. The two Miss Goldfinches kept a tea and coffee tavern which was patronized by Aunt Dorcas and the quieter market people. Over the door was a sign board upon which was painted a fat little green bird called “The Contented Siskin”, which was the name of their coffee tavern. They had a stable where the carrier's donkey rested when it came into Stymouth with the washing on Saturdays.

Robinson looked so tired that the elder Miss Goldfinch gave him a cup of tea; but they both told him to drink it up quickly.

“Wee, wee, wee! Yock yock!” said Robinson, scalding his nose.

In spite of their respect for Aunt Dorcas, the Miss Goldfinches disapproved of his solitary shopping; and they said that the basket was far too heavy for him.

“Neither of us could lift it,” said the elder Miss Goldfinch, holding out a tiny claw. “Get your cabbage seed and hurry back. Sim Ram's pony gig is still waiting in our stable. If you come back before he starts I feel sure he will give you a lift; at all events he will make room for your basket under the seat—and he passes Piggery Porcombe. Run away now!”

“Wee, wee, wee!” said Robinson.

“Whatever were they thinking of to let him come alone? He will never get home before dark,” said the elder Miss Goldfinch. “Fly to the stable, Clara; tell Sim Ram's pony not to start without the basket.”

The younger Miss Goldfinch flew across the yard. They were industrious, sprightly little lady birds, who kept lump sugar and thistle seed as well as tea in their tea-caddies. Their tables and china were spotlessly clean.





Chapter Six


Stymouth was full of inns; too full. The farmers usually put up their horses at the “Black Bull” or the “Horse and Farrier”; the smaller market people patronized the “Pig and Whistle”.

There was another inn called the “Crown and Anchor” at the corner of Fore Street. It was much frequented by seamen; several were lounging about the door with their hands in their pockets. One sailor-man in a blue jersey sauntered across the road, staring very hard at Robinson. Said he—“I say, little pig! do you like snuff?”

Now if Robinson had a fault, it was that he could not say “No”; not even to a hedgehog stealing eggs. As a matter of fact, snuff or tobacco made him sick. But instead of saying, “No, thank you, Mr. Man,” and going straight away about his business, he shuffled his feet, half closed one eye, hung his head on one side, and grunted.

The sailor pulled out a horn snuff box and presented a small pinch to Robinson, who wrapped it up in a little bit of paper, intending to give it to Aunt Dorcas. Then, not to be outdone in politeness, he offered the sailor-man some barley sugar.

If Robinson was not fond of snuff, at all events his new acquaintance had no objection to candy. He ate an alarming quantity. Then he pulled Robinson's ear and complimented him, and said he had five chins. He promised to take Robinson to the cabbage seed shop; and, finally, he begged to have the honour of showing him over a ship engaged in the ginger trade, commanded by Captain Barnabas Butcher, and named the “Pound of Candles”.

Robinson did not very much like the name. It reminded him of tallow, of lard, of crackle and trimmings of bacon. But he allowed himself to be led away, smiling shyly, and walking on his toes. If Robinson had only known … that man was a ship's cook!

As they turned down the steep narrow lane, out of High Street, leading to the harbour, old Mr. Mumby at his shop door called out anxiously, “Robinson! Robinson!” But there was too much noise of carts. And a customer coming into the shop at that moment distracted his attention, and he forgot the suspicious behaviour of the sailor. Otherwise, out of regard for the family, he would undoubtedly have ordered his dog, Tipkins, to go and fetch Robinson back. As it was, he was the first person to give useful information to the police, when Robinson had been missed. But it was then too late.

Robinson and his new friend went down the long flight of steps to the harbour basin—very high steps, steep and slippery. The little pig was obliged to jump from step to step until the sailor kindly took hold of him. They walked along the quay hand in hand; their appearance seemed to cause unbounded amusement.

Robinson looked about him with much interest. He had peeped over those steps before when he had come into Stymouth in the donkey cart, but he had never ventured to go down, because the sailors are rather rough, and because they frequently have little snarling terriers on guard about their vessels.

There were ever so many ships in the harbour; the noise and bustle was almost as loud as it had been up above in the market square. A big three-masted ship called the “Goldielocks” was discharging a cargo of oranges; and farther along the quay, a small coasting brig called “Little Bo Peep” of Bristol was loading up with bales of wool belonging to the sheep of Ewehampton and Lambworthy.

Old Sim Ram, with a sheepbell and big curly horns, stood by the gangway keeping count of the bales. Every time the crane swung round and let down another bale of wool into the hold, with a scuffle of rope through the pulley, Simon Ram nodded his old head, and the bell went “tinkle tinkle, tong”, and he gave a gruff bleat.

He was a person who knew Robinson by sight and ought to have warned him. He had often passed Piggery Porcombe when he drove down the lane in his gig. But his blind eye was turned towards the quay; and he had been flustered and confused by an argument with the pursers as to whether thirty-five bales of wool had been hoisted on board already or only thirty-four. So he kept his one useful eye carefully on the wool, and counted it by the notches on his tally stick—another bale—another notch—thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven; he hoped the number would come right at the finish.

His bob-tailed sheepdog, Timothy Gyp, was also acquainted with Robinson, but he was busy superintending a dog fight between an Airedale terrier belonging to the collier “Margery Dawe” and a Spanish dog belonging to the “Goldielocks”. No one took any notice of their growling and snarling, which ended in both rolling over the side of the quay and falling into the water. Robinson kept close to the sailor and held his hand very tight.

The “Pound of Candles” proved to be a good-sized schooner, newly painted and decorated with certain flags, whose significance was not understood by Robinson. She lay near the outer end of the jetty. The tide was running up fast, lapping against the ship's sides and straining the thick hawsers by which she was moored to the quay.

The crew were stowing goods on board and doing things with ropes under the direction of Captain Barnabas Butcher; a lean, brown, nautical person with a rasping voice. He banged things about and grumbled; parts of his remarks were audible on the quay. He was speaking about the tug “Sea-horse”—and about the spring tide, with a north-east wind behind it—and the baker's man and fresh vegetables—“to be shipped at eleven sharp; likewise a joint of…” He stopped short suddenly, and his eye lighted upon the cook and Robinson.

Robinson and the cook went on board across a shaky plank. When Robinson stepped on to the deck, he found himself face to face with a large yellow cat who was blacking boots.

The cat gave a start of surprise and dropped its blacking brush. It then began to wink and make extraordinary faces at Robinson. He had never seen a cat behave in that way before. He inquired whether it was ill. Whereupon the cook threw a boot at it, and it rushed up into the rigging. But Robinson he invited most affably to descend into the cabin, to partake of muffins and crumpets.

I do not know how many muffins Robinson consumed. He went on eating them until he fell asleep; and he went on sleeping until his stool gave a lurch, and he fell off and rolled under the table. One side of the cabin floor swung up to the ceiling; and the other side of the ceiling swung down to the floor. Plates danced about; and there were shoutings and thumpings and rattling of chains and other bad sounds.

Robinson picked himself up, feeling bumped. He scrambled up a sort of a ladder-staircase on to the deck. Then he gave squeal upon squeal of horror! All round the ship there were great big green waves; the houses on the quay were like dolls' houses; and high up inland, above the red cliffs and green fields, he could see the farm of Piggery Porcombe looking no bigger than a postage stamp. A little white patch in the orchard was Aunt Porcas's washing, spread out to bleach upon the grass. Near at hand the black tug “Sea-horse” smoked and plunged and rolled. They were winding in the tow rope which had just been cast loose from the “Pound of Candles”.

Captain Barnabas stood up in the bows of his schooner; he yelled and shouted to the master of the tug. The sailors shouted also, and pulled with a will, and hoisted the sails. The ship heeled over and rushed through the waves, and there was a smell of the sea.

As for Robinson—he tore round and round the deck like one distracted, shrieking very shrill and loud. Once or twice he slipped down; for the deck was extremely sideways; but still he ran and he ran. Gradually his squeals subsided into singing, but still he kept on running, and this is what he sang—





“Poor Pig Robinson Crusoe!

Oh, how in the world could they do so?

They have set him afloat, in a horrible boat,

Oh, poor pig Robinson Crusoe!”





The sailors laughed until they cried; but when Robinson had sung that same verse about fifty times, and upset several sailors by rushing between their legs, they began to get angry. Even the ship's cook was no longer civil to Robinson. On the contrary, he was very rude indeed. He said that if Robinson did not leave off singing through his nose, he would make him into pork chops.

Then Robinson fainted, and fell flat upon the deck of the “Pound of Candles”.





Chapter Seven


It must not be supposed for one moment that Robinson was ill-treated on board ship. Quite the contrary. He was even better fed and more petted on the “Pound of Candles” than he had been at Piggery Porcombe. So, after a few days' fretting for his kind old aunts (especially while he was seasick), Robinson became perfectly contented and happy. He found what is called his “sea legs”; and he scampered about the deck until the time when he became too fat and lazy to scamper.

The cook was never tired of boiling porridge for him. A whole sack full of meal and a sack of potatoes appeared to have been provided especially for his benefit and pleasure. He could eat as much as he pleased. It pleased him to eat a great deal and to lie on the warm boards of the deck. He got lazier and lazier as the ship sailed south into warmer weather. The mate made a pet of him; the crew gave him tit-bits. The cook rubbed his back and scratched his sides—his ribs could not be tickled, because he had laid so much fat on. The only persons who refused to treat him as a joke were the yellow tom-cat and Captain Barnabas Butcher, who was of a sour disposition.

The attitude of the cat was perplexing to Robinson. Obviously it disapproved of the maize meal porridge business, and it spoke mysteriously about the impropriety of greediness, and about the disastrous results of over-indulgence. But it did not explain what those results might be, and as the cat itself cared neither for yellow meal nor 'taties, Robinson thought that its warnings might arise from prejudice. It was not unfriendly. It was mournful and foreboding.

The cat itself was crossed in love. Its morose and gloomy outlook upon life was partly the result of separation from the owl. That sweet hen-bird, a snowy owl of Lapland, had sailed upon a northern whaler, bound for Greenland. Whereas the “Pound of Candles” was heading for the tropic seas.

Therefore the cat neglected its duties, and was upon the worst of terms with the cook. Instead of blacking boots and valeting the Captain, it spent days and nights in the rigging, serenading the moon. Between times it came down on deck, and remonstrated with Robinson.

It never told him plainly why he ought not to eat so much; but it referred frequently to a mysterious date (which Robinson could never remember)—the date of Captain Butcher's birthday, which he celebrated annually by an extra good dinner.

“That's what they are saving up apples for. The onions are done—sprouted with the heat. I heard Captain Barnabas tell the cook that onions were of no consequence as long as there were apples for sauce.”

Robinson paid no attention. In fact, he and the cat were both on the side of the ship, watching a shoal of silvery fishes. The ship was completely becalmed. The cook strolled across the deck to see what the cat was looking at and exclaimed joyfully at sight of fresh fish. Presently half the crew were fishing. They baited their lines with bits of scarlet wool and bits of biscuit; and the boatswain had a successful catch on a line baited with a shiny button.

The worst of button fishing was that so many fish dropped off while being hauled on deck. Consequently Captain Butcher allowed the crew to launch the jolly boat, which was let down from some iron contraption called “the davits” on to the glassy surface of the sea. Five sailors got into the boat; the cat jumped in also. They fished for hours. There was not a breath of wind.

In the absence of the cat, Robinson fell asleep peacefully upon the warm deck. Later he was disturbed by the voices of the mate and the cook, who had not gone fishing. The former was saying—

“I don't fancy loin of pork with sunstroke, Cooky. Stir him up; or else throw a piece of sail cloth over him. I was bred on a farm myself. Pigs should never be let sleep in a hot sun.”

“As why?” inquired the cook.

“Sunstroke,” replied the mate. “Likewise it scorches the skin; makes it peely like; spoils the look of the crackling.”

At this point a rather heavy dirty piece of sail cloth was flung over Robinson, who struggled and kicked with sudden grunts.

“Did he hear you, Matey?” asked the cook in a lower voice.

“Don't know; don't matter; he can't get off the ship,” replied the mate, lighting his pipe. “Might upset his appetite; he's feeding beautiful,” said the cook.

Presently the voice of Captain Barnabas Butcher was heard. He had come up on deck after a siesta below in his cabin.

“Proceed to the crow's nest on the main mast; observe the horizon through a telescope according to latitude and longitude. We ought to be amongst the archipelago by the chart and compass,” said the voice of Captain Butcher.

It reached the ears of Robinson through the sail cloth in muffled tones, but peremptory; although it was not so received by the mate, who occasionally contradicted the Captain when no one else was listening.

“My corns are very painful,” said the mate.

“Send the cat up,” ordered Captain Barnabas briefly.

“The cat is out in the boat fishing.”

“Fetch him in then,” said Captain Barnabas, losing his temper. “He has not blacked my boots for a fortnight.” He went below; that is, down a step-ladder into his cabin, where he proceeded to work out the latitude and longitude again, in search of the archipelago.

“It's to be hoped that he mends his temper before next Thursday, or he won't enjoy roast pork!” said the mate to the cook.

They strolled to the other end of the deck to see what fish had been caught; the boat was coming back.

As the weather was perfectly calm, it was left over night upon the glassy sea, tied below a port-hole (or ship's window) at the stern of the “Pound of Candles”.

The cat was sent up the mast with a telescope; it remained there for some time. When it came down it reported quite untruthfully that there was nothing in sight. No particular watch or look-out was kept that night upon the “Pound of Candles” because the ocean was so calm. The cat was supposed to watch—if anybody did. All the rest of the ship's company played cards.

Not so the cat or Robinson. The cat had noticed a slight movement under the sail cloth. It found Robinson shivering with fright and in floods of tears. He had overheard the conversation about pork.

“I'm sure I have given you enough hints,” said the cat to Robinson.“What do you suppose they were feeding you up for? Now don't start squealing, you little fool! It's as easy as snuff, if you will listen and stop crying. You can row, after a fashion.” (Robinson had been out fishing occasionally and caught several crabs.)

“Well, you have not far to go; I could see the top of the Bong tree on an island N.N.E., when I was up the mast. The straits of the archipelago are too shallow for the “Pound of Candles”, and I'll scuttle all the other boats. Come along, and do what I tell you!” said the cat.

The cat, actuated partly by unselfish friendship, and partly by a grudge against the cook and Captain Barnabas Butcher, assisted Robinson to collect a varied assortment of necessaries. Shoes, sealing-wax, a knife, an armchair, fishing tackle, a straw hat, a saw, fly papers, a potato pot, a telescope, a kettle, a compass, a hammer, a barrel of flour, another of meal, a keg of fresh water, a tumbler, a teapot, nails, a bucket, a screwdriver—

“That reminds me,” said the cat, and what did it do but go round the deck with a gimlet and bore large holes in the three boats that remained on board the “Pound of Candles”.

By this time there began to be ominous sounds below; those of the sailors who had had bad hands were beginning to be tired of carding. So the cat took a hasty farewell of Robinson, pushed him over the ship's side, and he slid down the rope into the boat. The cat unfastened the upper end of the rope and threw it after him. Then it ascended the rigging and pretended to sleep upon its watch.

Robinson stumbled somewhat in taking his seat at the oars. His legs were short for rowing. Captain Barnabas in the cabin suspended his deal, a card in his hand, listening (the cook took the opportunity to look under the card), then he went on slapping down the cards, which drowned the sound of oars upon the placid sea.

After another hand, two sailors left the cabin and went on deck. They noticed something having the appearance of a large black beetle in the distance. One of them said it was an enormous cockroach, swimming with its hind legs. The other said it was a dolphinium. They disputed, rather loudly. Captain Barnabas, who had had a hand with no trumps at all after the cook dealing—Captain Barnabas came on deck and said—

“Bring me my telescope.”

The telescope had disappeared; likewise the shoes, the sealing-wax, the compass, the potato pot, the straw hat, the hammer, the nails, the bucket, the screwdriver, and the armchair.

“Take the jolly boat and see what it is,” ordered Captain Butcher.

“All jolly fine, but suppose it is a dolphinium?” said the mate mutinously.

“Why, bless my life, the jolly boat is gone!” exclaimed a sailor.

“Take another boat, take all the three other boats; it's that pig and that cat!” roared the Captain.

“Nay, sir, the cat's up the rigging asleep.”

“Bother the cat! Get the pig back! The apple sauce will be wasted!” shrieked the cook, dancing about and brandishing a knife and fork.

The davits were swung out, the boats were let down with a swish and a splash, all the sailors tumbled in, and rowed frantically. And most of them were glad to row frantically back to the “Pound of Candles”. For every boat leaked badly, thanks to the cat.





Chapter Eight


Robinson rowed away from the “Pound of Candles”. He tugged steadily at the oars. They were heavy for him. The sun had set, but I understand that in the tropics—I have never been there—there is a phosphorescent light upon the sea. When Robinson lifted his oars, the sparkling water dripped from the blades like diamonds. And presently the moon began to rise above the horizon—rising like half a great silver plate. Robinson rested on his oars and gazed at the ship, motionless in the moonlight, on a sea without a ripple. It was at this moment—he being a quarter of a mile away—that the two sailors came on deck, and thought his boat was a swimming beetle.

Robinson was too far away to see or hear the uproar on board the “Pound of Candles”; but he did presently perceive that three boats were starting in pursuit. Involuntarily he commenced to squeal, and rowed frantically. But before he had time to exhaust himself by racing, the ship's boats turned back. Then Robinson remembered the cat's work with the gimlet, and he knew that the boats were leaking. For the rest of the night he rowed quietly, without haste. He was not inclined to sleep, and the air was pleasantly cool. Next day it was hot, but Robinson slept soundly under the sail cloth, which the cat had been careful to send with him, in case he wished to rig up a tent.

The ship receded from view—you know the sea is not really flat. First he could not see the hull, then he could not see the deck, then only part of the masts, then nothing at all.

Robinson had been steering his course by the ship. Having lost sight of this direction sign, he turned round to consult his compass—when bump, bump, the boat touched a sandbank. Fortunately it did not stick.

Robinson stood up in the boat, working one oar backwards, and gazing around. What should he see but the top of the Bong tree!

Half an hour's rowing brought him to the beach of a large and fertile island. He landed in the most approved manner in a convenient sheltered bay, where a stream of boiling water flowed down the silvery strand. The shore was covered with oysters. Acid drops and sweets grew upon the trees. Yams, which are a sort of sweet potato, abounded ready cooked. The bread-fruit tree grew iced cakes and muffins, ready baked; so no pig need sigh for porridge. Overhead towered the Bong tree.

If you want a more detailed description of the island, you must read “Robinson Crusoe”. The island of the Bong tree was very like Crusoe's, only without its drawbacks. I have never been there myself, so I rely upon the report of the Owl and the Pussy Cat, who visited it eighteen months later, and spent a delightful honeymoon there. They spoke enthusiastically about the climate—only it was a little too warm for the Owl.

Later on Robinson was visited by Stumpy and little dog Tipkins. They found him perfectly contented, and in the best of good health. He was not at all inclined to return to Stymouth. For anything I know he may be living there still upon the island. He grew fatter and fatter and more fatterer; and the ship's cook never found him.

THE END





THREE LITTLE MICE


Three little mice sat down to spin.

Pussy passed by and she peeped in.

“What are you at my fine little men?”

“Making coats for gentlemen.”

“Shall I come in and cut off your threads?”

“Oh no! Miss Pussy, you'd bite off our heads!”





THE SLY OLD CAT


This is a sly old cat, who gave a tea party to a rat.

This is the rat in his best clothes coming down the area steps.

They had their tea in the kitchen.

“How do you do, Mr. Rat? Will you sit on this chair?” said the cat.

“I will eat my bread and butter first,” said the cat, “and then you shall eat the crumbs that are left, Mr. Rat!”

“This is a very rude way of treating visitors!” said Mr. Rat to himself.

“Now I will pour out my tea,” said the cat, “and you shall lick up the drops that are left in the milk jug, Mr. Rat; and then I will have some dessert!” said the cat.

“I believe she is going to eat me for dessert; I wish I'd never come!” said poor Mr. Rat.

She tipped up the milk jug—that greedy old cat! She didn't want to leave one single drop for the rat.

But the rat jumped on the table and gave the jug a pat, and it slipped down quite tight over the head of the cat! Then the cat banged about the kitchen with its head fast in the jug.

And the rat sat on the table drinking tea out of a mug. Then he put a muffin in a paper bag and went away. And he ate the whole muffin at one sitting; so that is the end of the rat.

And the cat broke the jug against the leg of the kitchen table; so that is the end of the cat.





THE FOX AND THE STORK


“Sir,” said Mr. Tod to King Stork, “will you honour me by taking tea with me?” King Stork bowed. He walked home with Mr. Fox; he took long strides and Mr. Tod trotted.

Mr. Tod is a stingy person. He regretted the invitation as soon as he had given it, when he considered the size of Mr. Stork. So he made a plan. Said he to Mr. Stork—“When I have visitors I use Great Grandmother Vixen's Derby tea set.” He poured the tea into two flat saucers.

King Stork dipped the point of his bill into the saucer, but he could scarcely scoop up a drop. Presently he made a bow and took leave. Mr. Tod lapped up the remaining tea himself.

As he had a conscience which told him he had behaved shabbily—Mr. Tod was surprised to receive an invitation to lunch with King Stork.

The note was brought by a very nervous lapwing.

King Stork's home was upon the top of a high chimney-stack over the roof of a tall old house. As Mr. Tod had no wings for flying up aloft onto roofs—King Stork came down and met him in the courtyard of the house, and led him inside and up a corkscrew staircase. There was a pleasing smell of broth when they reached the attic. The broth was served in two narrow-necked pitchers.

King Stork plunged his long bill into one pitcher and sucked up the broth. Mr. Tod could only lick his lips and sniff. Presently he got up and said, “Good Day!”

King Stork drew his bill out of his empty pitcher. He was a silent old bird. All he said was, “Tit for tat!”





THE RABBITS' CHRISTMAS PARTY
